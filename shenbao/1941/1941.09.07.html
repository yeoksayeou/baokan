<p>合衆社六日斐拉台爾斐亞電　此間官員昨日發表、美艦格里埃號、爲一九三九年歐戰開始時再度服役之舊式驅逐艦五十九艘中之一、彼等宣稱、該艦曾經再度命在六年中擔任正役云、</p>
<p>羅斯福談話</p>
<p>路透社六日華盛頓電羅斯福總統昨在新聞記者招待席上、答復關於美驅逐艦格里埃號被潛艇攻擊事之問話、謂載運郵件前往冰島之一〇九四噸驅逐艦格里埃號被一潛艇攻擊、不止一次、時在白晝、視綫頗明、地點確在大西洋中之美國方面、該艦標　分明、高懸美旗、當被攻擊時獨自行駛云、至於格里埃號究被攻擊幾次、則總統未曾說明之、亦未言不止一次之攻擊、是吾在星期四晨比較的短時間內爲之、抑相隔若干時爲之、總統亦不允討論攻擊發生之所在處、記者問、如施擊者果被覓見、則將何以處之、總統答稱、渠以爲美國軍艦將殲除之、甚幸格里埃號未被擊中、該潛艇之射擊描準何以若是惡劣、渠無法言之、潛艇瞭望鏡是否露出水面、渠不願披露之、亦不能討論之、總統對於格里埃號艦長之擲落深水炸彈表示贊成、殆無疑義、某記者問，潛艇白晝在施放魚雷之遠處、得勿誤認船隻吾、總統答稱、渠所可能釋者、如潛艇將其瞭望鏡露出水面、則未有誤認船隻之理由、吾人須知魚雷大都用瞭視器放射、惟各國潛艇連德、義在內、皆置聽聲器、可循聲放雷、不過不若用瞭視器之準確耳、記者問、總統將吾置格里埃號事於射擊式戰爭之列、總統答稱、此爲假定問話、未便答復、記者又問、格里埃號得無在大西洋美國方面同時亦在德國所宣布之戰爭區內、總統答稱、美國從未接到關於劃定此種戰爭區之通吿、記者復問、格里埃號之立即擲下深水炸彈、是吾依照訓令爲之、總統答稱、未有與此相反之情報、設記者易地而處、在被攻擊時、將如何應付乎、總統在招待新聞記者之初、曾與其海軍副官耳語片時、而後始言及格里埃號事件、謂華盛頓若干人士之批評、使渠憶及一故事、前有兒童在走學校之途中、爲匿於林中之一人開槍射擊、其父母子女未被擊中、遂毫無行動、以爲未有搜查此林或採行其他步驟之理由、某記者揷間曰、然則今搜查此林乎、總統答曰、然、且可謂校長（意即爲總統）現正調查此事矣、記者又問、格里埃號之遭攻擊、已使致美國軍艦之訓令稍有變更乎、總統答曰、否、記者問、此次攻擊將吾爲外交上行動之根據、總統置諸不答、</p>
<p>美艦已接警報　慎防海上剽襲</p>
<p>路透社六日華盛頓電美國各報皆以大字刋載格里埃號被攻消息、多以美國船隻將續遭潛艇攻擊爲慮、某通信社稱、衆信大西洋美國軍艦已接海軍部警吿、囑愼防海上之軸心剽襲、華盛頓午後報在其前幅全面載一社論、題爲「今已屆制止希特勒之時矣」、略謂、希特勒殆將以此爲交戰行爲、或造成射擊或戰爭二者孰是、吾人固不知之、但二者並無多大差別、吾人所知者、即使德方今米首先開火、日後亦必爲之、吾人行動此其時矣、紐的時報軍事專家濮拉特撰文謂、德潛艇明　其爲美國驅逐艦而故意擊之、蓋海軍界中人皆熟知格里埃號二驅逐艦之形式、決不致誤認其爲艦也、紐的郵報微集美國各界對此事件之意見、其所得結果、表示一般輿情大都鎭定、現採竚視態度、亦有謂何國潛艇尙無確證者、更有謂此必爲認識錯誤之事件者、華盛頓若干方面稱、美國船隻往來冰島、現若是之頻繁、欲求不與德艦發生衝突、殆不可得、此事不致使美、德關係愈臻惡化、但類此事件日後或將繼續發生、今不過其發端耳、國會中人皆信、格里埃號业未作戰、僅行使遇攻自衛之訓令而已、此種磨擦、定將使美國與情趨於一致、當軸必俟興情一致、定能續有行動、以制軸心也、美國各報載有柏林消息、據謂、柏林不知此事、</p>
<p>英官方守緘默　的竟謂美煽動</p>
<p>路透社六日倫敦電昨日英國人士之注意、集中於美國傳來美驅逐艦格里埃號被德潛匯攻擊之消息、惟路透社外交訪員昨聞諸倫敦官塲、此純爲美·德間事件、英方不予以批許、此間民衆向以爲德國依照希特勒個別擊破之政策、此時竭力避免對美衝突、乃今竟發生攻擊美艦事、故頗訝異、</p>
<p>合衆社六日倫教電、若干晨報今日稱、美艦格里爾埃號在北大西洋受襲擊、爲德國向美國第一次直接挑戰、各報稱、美國之大批意志不堅份子、現已認識、不論彼等願意與吾、「此爲美國之戰爭之最充分意義」、羅斯福總統所稱、此潛艇將被弋獲、各晨報咸大字加以登載、格里埃號事件之消息、令蘇聯之戰訊暗淡、每日郵報稱、任何謂此事、可認爲結束之語、已被羅斯福總統一掃而空、每日電訊報稱、「今惟視柏林方面聲言其態度」、</p>
<p>國際社六日拍林電德方指摘稱、傳聞中之美艦格里埃號在大西洋上遭潛艇攻擊一事、乃一種故意欲煽動戰爭之行爲、某官方發言人推測、美艦之被擊、乃英方所爲之事、此間對該事件均極表懷疑、一般人均以爲、此事乃用以作戰事上之宣傳、目的蓋欲煽動美國人民云、</p>
<p>合衆社六日羅馬電羅馬報紙昨對美艦格里埃號在大西洋被襲擊事、未加隻字之登載、此間一般傾向、係不重視此項消息、官方布吿未發表以前、官塲並無評論云、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社五日里昂電美國第一艘油船安抵海參崴後、「時報」頃評云、此事對於現行美日關係、殆爲一極微妙之試騐、觀日本對於美國油船經由其所控制之海洋駛往目的地、而不加阻止、可知日政府仍欲爲他日與英美成立協定稍留餘地、</p>
<p>海通社六日東京電　據讀賣新聞稱、日本之反對美國軍火由馬尼刺運蘇聯、與反對由海參崴運輸相同、現在上海之蘇貨船五艘、即欲接運抵馬尼刺之軍火、日政府發言人偉岸一星期五稱、此項船隻經過日本領海之接近與由美至海參崴所通過之日本領海亳無二致、因此日本對於兩條航綫所持之態度相同、日本民衆亦表示意見、認美國計劃鏗阿拉斯加至蘇聯之航本綫亦爲包圍日本之另一種步驟、日本報章對此均曾加以猛烈抨擊云、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>悼張季鸞先生</h3>
<p>頃接渝電，大公報主筆張季鸞先生已於昨晨四時病故。這消息的重要性，雖抵不過美日關係或德蘇戰事的電訉，但就中國立塲，尤其是中國新聞界的立塲而言，的確是一件非常重大的新聞，因爲張先生不僅是中國報業的先進，實在更是最能代表中國民意，最能宣達民族意志的一位人物；張先生平日的言論，不但已深深打入社會各階層，並且可以說，已相當滲透到統治階級，允其蔣委員長個人，素來視張先生爲諍友，在委員長面前，他往往能道其慕僚所不敢言或不能言的，祇此一點，即可看出張先生的人格學問，已如何被中國當局與社會所尊重。</p>
<p>季鸞先生今年纔五十五歲，但他致力新聞事業，至少已有三十多年；他自日本留學歸來，即在上海報界服務，和于右任邵力子葉楚傖諸先生都同過事；他畢生最成功的事業，當然是從民國十五年起在天津所接辦的大公報，可是實際上講來，他的成功基礎，却遠在接辦大公報之前即已確立：他有終身服務報業的志趣，所以一生雖和政治不斷發生密切聯繫，却始終敝屣尊榮，四十年來，依然書生本色；他更有愛國家愛社會愛人類的熱情，所以他的文章總是那麼有情感有血肉，記得西安事變發生之後，張先生曾寫了一篇勸告張楊二將的文章。全篇都流露愛國家愛領袖　同時也愛護張楊的眞摯情感，當局曾把此文印成單張，用飛機載往西安上空散發，以感化城內的將士，蔣委員長之終於安然脫險，不能不說多少得力於此；又有一决，兩廣問題鬧得念弄愈僵　中央差不多已準備對廣西用兵了，但季鸞先生的文字，却天天喊着一致對外，避免內戰，結果居然和平解決，發揮了輿論界的偉大力量；他如戰前救亡協會七君子一案、季鸞先生也曾不避嫌疑，不畏艱難，一再向蔣委員長及其他當局呼籲營救　終於恢復了七人的自由；諸如此類，都足以證明張先生不但是一位文章寫得好，眼光識見高人一等的名記者，同時却更是一位感情篤摯，眞愛國家眞愛社會的長者；他愛靑年，無時不想提携後進；他鄙視金錢，根本不知享受；他不怕權勢，過去曾因針砭當局，而在北平坐過監獄；他有學者的丰度，待人接物，輒令人生冬日可親之感；這些還都是就私的方面而言，若從國家的立塲來說，他對國族最大的貢獻，莫過於四年來他贊助抗建大業的重大功績；他主張奮戰到底，他信仰奮戰必成，他更隨時隨刻，呼籲團結，他對於國際大局的認識，極其深刻，他始終相信世界大勢必能有利於中國，他的信念，他的判斷，現在差不多已一一實現了。但是蒼天不佑，竟不待這位老記者目覩勝利，生生把他奪回去了。這不僅是中國新聞界的莫大損失，同時更是中華國族的非常不幸。</p>
<p>張先生在八年前，便發現患着二期肺病，以他如此淸癯瘦弱的身體。本應該及早休養，絕對不宜再長途跋涉，或從事筆墨生涯，但他本着忠於國家，忠於報業的熱誠。非獨不肯休息，四年來反而僕僕於渝港之間，不斷爲國家效力、爲人羣盡職。他的不起，雖如晴天霹靂，但在他的友好，允其是曾經勸他節勞的人們，却早就替他躭心着，他這種鞠躬盡瘁的精神，不但是全國報業的表率，更是人人應該效法的模範，吾人在萬分哀悼之中，惟有牢記張先生臨終「以積極精神，爲國奮鬥，」的遺言，庶幾不負這位獻身國家的報業偉人！最後吾人敬向遠在渝港的大公報同人和張先生的遺族，致其最懇切的唁意！</p>

<h3>德長射程大砲　猛轟列寧格勒城　居民二百萬動員協力抗敵　戈美爾紅軍反攻戰事劇烈</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社六日瑞典京城電　據蘇聯戰報消息、北路紅軍現正死力阻止德軍向列寗城推進、該城以南六十哩之諾伏格勒特區及伊爾鬥湖以西、戰况允烈、該城北面亦有激戰、德軍沿愛沙尼亞京城欠路推進、先頭部隊距列寗城僅五哩、現正遭遇紅軍空前抵抗、德軍長射程大砲、已能轟擊該城、德國空車則不斷向芬蘭灣蘇聯各根據地轟炸、至中路方面、紅軍在斯摩倫斯克、勃利盎斯克·及戈美爾各處展開反攻、</p>
<p>合衆社六日紐約電　列寧格勒大戰昨已進入第十六日、城內居民二百萬人業已動員、而德軍則開始以重砲猛攻該城、據莫斯科官報稱、人民聞衛義勇軍數隊、與納粹進攻者首决直接作戰、當將德人擊退、叉稱、蘇軍初時聽任納粹坦克車進人蘇軍後方、蘇軍則同緊隨車後之德步兵集中射擊、各坦克車迨後均被擊毀、柏林承認在列寗格勒遭遇蘇聯兇猛抵抗、消息靈通界稱、德軍或不肯毀壞列寗格勒、因該城對德殊爲有用也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社五日芬京電　據芬蘭情報局宣佈、列寗城內現已發生大火、火光燭天、自芬蘭沿海一帶東望、隱的可見云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社五日蘇聯邊境某地電　木日爲德蘇戰爭第七十六日、列寗城爭奪戰已正式開始、今晨德軍曾以軍砲向該城猛轟、落彈不下數千枚、截至發常時止、猶在激戰中、該城現已三面被圍、城防司令伏洛希羅夫上將已下令守城、準備巷戰、所有官民均已全副武裝、德軍事專家羅埃夫將軍搜長堡壘戰、現已率部參加攻城、列寗城尙有鐵路兩綫與外界聯絡、德軍擬予截斷、雙方刻已發生劇戰、伏洛希羅夫上將已調集大批機械化部隊馳往增援、</p>
<p>路透社六日倫敦電　列寧格勒戈美爾而奧迪薩仍爲東线之主要戰場、蘇聯公報雖仍簡單報道全线有戰事、但就各方面消息面觀、戈美爾之戰似正日趨激烈、據莫斯科路透社訪員電稱、蘇聯最高統率部對於最近發展頗抱樂觀、列寗格勒及如與其東南陣地之蘇軍同時聯台進攻、則德軍或將陷於腹背受敵之困境、但目前蘇軍尙無採取此項戰略之徵象、斯摩倫斯克附近之中區戰线、蘇軍似處主動地位、而德軍則採取守勢、芬蘭方面今晨又傳德軍已接近白林斯克之鐵路交叉點、（該處位於戈美爾以東六〇哩）惟莫斯科電訊已予以否認、</p>
<p>戰线延長二千英哩　爭奪三城展開惡戰</p>
<p>路透社六日倫敦電　軍事評論員稱、德軍力圖奪取的蘇聯西部三城中之列寗格勒與奧迪薩兩城、昨日仍有戰事、第三城爲基輔、並無新消息、但前綫中區（基輔在此區南端）傳來蘇軍新獲重要勝利之訊、據昨日公報之補充文吿稱、丁莫生柯上將所率蘇軍在中區北路之波柯伏區、擊潰德步兵第二六三師、該師六天來喪折官兵七千人其殘餘紛紛潰退、衆信丁莫生柯率軍反攻、已迫使德軍再度集中於中區、而此區德軍從戈美爾南犯者、其進展已趨緩滯、列寗格勒現有六人組成之戰爭議會、協助伏羅希洛夫上將鎭守、昨德軍司令部揚言德軍刻正作包圍列寗格勒之進行、該城已在德軍之猛烈砲火下云、此說末獲莫斯科方面之證實、路透社駐莫斯科訪員曾發電話釗列寗格勒探詢、旋接來電據稱、德軍刻正鞏固其陣地、以便向該城展開攻勢、但刻遭蘇軍不斷反攻、甚劇烈之血戰正在進行中、長二千哩前移南端之奧迪薩刻仍在堅決扼守中、該處助德作戰之羅軍、顯受重大打擊、蘇軍當地指揮官伏洛畢特少將報吿、另有難步兵兩帥開赴前綫、接代八月杪被摧毀之三或四師羅軍者、亦已受重創、前綫南區蘇軍總司令布得尼將刻仍率軍反攻尼泊河兩岸、蘇空軍與海軍航空隊之飛機亦猛施襲擊、以解列寗格勒之奧迪薩所受之壓力、但空中雖亦　　　　　、在列寗格勒之奧迪薩樹立天空絕對優勢、德方無一綫電臺未言及蘇方　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　、</p>
<p>奧迪薩港深溝高壨　軍民準備決一死戰</p>
<p>路透社六日莫斯科電　奧迪薩現除海道外、已與蘇聯其他地方相隔絕、該地居民現正從事於防務工作極者成續、領導奢爲曾在蘇芬戰事中獲得蘇聯英雄榮譽之克里諾夫、由其敎授居民建築堡壘、並開掘壕溝及坦克直陷阱、奧迪薩平日雖非製造軍火之城市、但目前該城之工廠已改造坦克車與鐵甲車、對於防務極收效果、此外更大事製造地雷、每日可出產數千噸、</p>
<p>哥薩克兵銳不可當　德軍兩營完全殲滅</p>
<p>塔斯社六日莫斯科電　著名全世界之哥薩克騎兵、最近極爲活躍、予敵重創、由杜伐率領下之騎兵部隊、最近突入敵後方、襲擊敵兵並截斷敵方交通極著功績、在第一次接戰中、即消滅德方第四百三十步兵團第三營、哥薩克騎兵徐襲擊敵兵及截斷交通外、並焚燬敵倉庫、日前哥薩克騎兵叉在某處殲敵步兵一營、總之、哥薩克騎兵戰術神秘、彼等之突然而來、滿載而去、均使德兵手足失措而無法應付、</p>
<p>保國黑海沿岸　船隻集中待命</p>
<h3>德海軍首腦會晤鮑利斯　兩國採聯合新行動先聲</h3>
<p>路透社六日土京電　此間人士認德海軍首腦賴特大將之會晤保加利亞王鮑利斯、乃德保將對蘇採取聯合新舉動之先聲、消息靈通人士相信、德保或將從陸海空三路攻擊被圍之奧迪薩或克里米亞半島大隊德軍開抵保國及船隻集中於保國沿黑海之伐那與柏迦斯兩口岸、可爲佐證、德保軍若從黑海登陸、同時在陸上進攻、則將威脅蘇方布得尼上將所率之烏克蘭軍、若德軍得逞，更將進窺高加索與巴庫油田、但希特勒欲如願以償、須先在奧迪薩興克里米亞獲得空中優勢、並擊退蘇方黑海艦隊而後可、然此艦隊之實力、遠較德保所能調動之海軍爲强、再者奧迪薩與克里米亞均有固若金湯之海岸防務、德方非摧毀此等防務不能登陸、此間人士多信希特勒將循此等路錢展開攻擊、蓋圖拚死一戰、俾在冬季前攻抵產油之高加索也、</p>
<h3>維堡戰後　成瓦礫場　貓狗街中爭食　城內闐無一人</h3>
<p>合衆社六日紐約電本社特派員漢生新抵維堡、據渠報稱、該處後方之蘇軍於傷亡一萬人後、以大火及炸藥將該城擊燬、又稱、街道上狗貓及巨鼠互相毆鬥爭食、城內已無一人云、</p>

<h3>紅軍士兵　作戰精神可佩　唯知服從上峯命令　赴湯蹈火在所不辭</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社五日瑞士京城電「日內瓦日報」頃　蘇聯戰地訪員來電、叙述紅軍素質甚詳、略謂紅軍士兵富於機械化精神、與普通士兵逈不相同、其與共黨之關係、亦不若一般人想像之深切、紅軍敎育程度雖低、但頗易於駕馭、赴湯蹈火唯上峯命令是聽、要之紅車士兵宛如「機器人」、其戰鬭力極爲强勁、</p>
<h3>鮮血決不虛灑　光明終將來臨　倫敦追悼泰戈爾　蘇使發動人演說</h3>
<p>路透社六日倫敦電　印度同志會與平民自由協會昨夜聯合舉行印度詩哲泰戈爾（近在加爾各答逝世紀念會、蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基亦到會演說、略謂黑暗現方降於人類、在此一片黑暗中、泰戈爾燦爛光輝之象、突徵文化之最高形式與人道之最高理想、而使吾人復憶今日存在之黑暗必有終止之一日、余堅信將來必有　佳之時間、我數十萬以至數百萬同胞正滙鮮血與希特勒之機械化暴軍英勇奮鬥、以求此較佳之時間，而所灑之鮮血決非徒然、最後勝利必屬於我、終可建造更美滿之世界云、紀念會主席作家湯普森（泰戈爾之故友）亦致詞歡迎蘇大使夫婦、</p>

<h3>赫爾正式宣布　美日談話無進展　羅斯福將答近衛來函　對覆文內容則不透露</h3>
<p>合衆社六日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨日宜佈、近衛致羅斯福總統之信函、即將獲得答覆、赫爾在招待記者席上作此言、表示現時美·日談話、不必一定與近衛手札有連帶之關係、渠稱、前此數度與野村大使進行之試探談話、在未接近衛書信之前、即已開始、赫爾不肯特別闡明美國對近衛書信之答覆、惟就刻尙未作覆一事觀之、足以表示美國官方尙在硏究各項問題、並認近衛之手札爲軍要焉、現時似對日一般性質之討論、正待時機之發展、直至答覆近衛手札完畢後、再爲進行云、</p>
<p>國際社六日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾今日第一次指稱、美·日試探性談話、進行並不順利、赫爾相信、羅斯福總統最後將以覆文一件答覆日首相近衛之函件、但赫爾不願透露該覆文之內容、此間外交界一致相信、美，日談話因不能覓得一談判之共同根據、巳陷於停頓、此項見解、因赫爾之言、　見其可信、</p>
<p>華盛頓五日電　美日間探討性之談話、已發展至如何程度、華府方面毫無暗示、惟美方在羅斯福總統指示之下、仍櫃續對日談詁中、衆信日本顯係拖延時間、蓋迄今爲止、日本尙無具體證明願以信誠遵循美國之基本原則、解決美·日間題也、此間各界承認美·日關係仍以美國援華政策爲主要關鍵、官方人士重申美國之姑息政策業吿終止、羅斯福亦不致犧牲中國、以姑息日本、各方認爲、欲日本立即宣吿廢除擴大勢力之政策、或退出軸心、實希望甚徵、而東京方面傳出之消息、又傳時局益命爲緊張、蓋日本之極端派正要求政府以武力突破包圍圈也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社五日東京電　本社訪員頃自可靠方而探悉、美·日兩國談話、截至目前爲止、進行頗爲順利、係由羅斯福總統親自主持其事、赫爾國務卿僅居於次要地位、至於所討論之問題、此間消息靈通人士深恐消息洩漏後、引起變方內部之反對、或第三國之干涉、故拒不加以說明、惟在談判初期、日本似極力主張僅僅成立臨時辦法、以期暫時恢復兩國貿易、並以金融交易爲限、但自羅斯福總統在海上某處與英首相邱吉爾會晤後、此項談話即吿失敗、美政府並明白由知日本、美國對於成立臨時辦法之議、不復感覺興味、惟日本對於「蘆溝橋事變」以來、使美·日兩國睽離之各項政治問題、倘準備就其底蘊加以撿討、則美國亦願賡續進行談話、質言之、雙方苟欲解決經濟問題、非先就各項政治問題之足以左右美·日關係者、成立初步協定不可、當時華府方面盛傳、美政府已訓令駐日大使格魯向日政府提出非常重要之建議、顧無論如何、日閣對於擴大談商範圍一層、雖在原則上表示贊同、但又不得不將其所處立塲、隨時通知德·義政府、迨至八月二十八日、近衛復致函羅斯福總統、頓使美·日談話更趨明朗化、聞此函內容要點有二、（一）向美政府保證、兩國倘能成立協定、則日本內閣必能獲得國內各界之充分擁護、以實施此項協定、（二）兩國聞並無不可用談判方式解決之問題、此間美國人士則認爲現行談話果能成功、則其所得結果、匪特足以解決美·日問題、抑且不難進而解決中·日問題、並安定整個遠東局勢、又日·美雙方在談話初期所持之立塲、均極堅定、此殆皆係一種手段、俾能預留討價還價之餘地、按之實際、美·日兩政府均有覓取妥協之意向、此外關於日本脫離軸心之議、此間均謂、美國從未提出此項要求、即使提出作爲和平之代價、亦非日本任何內閣所能接受、職是之故、此一問題、尙談不到云、</p>

<p>銀行在進口行商請求供給外滙後、即須向平準會申請結匯、申請方式、因滬港相隔、或藉電報、或用書函、爲迅速計、以採用電請爲中、至申請手續、第一由原經手塡寫一向中國平準基金會求供外匯之申請書、此項表格、必須同樣塡寫五份、最後一份、須由申請銀行簽名蓋章、該申請書中包括（一）銀行名稱及地址、（二）進口商名稱及地址、（三）出外匯總額、（四）出賣外匯之日期及種類、（包括收匯人之姓名及地址）（五）進口物品調查、內分、甲·稅則號數、乙·種類細則、丙·價值（美金或英鎊）、丁·何國生產或製造、戊·由何國進口、及己·抵達日期、（六）進口口岸、（七）進口後轉運中國何處、（如事前預知、此條請塡明）、（八）在中國分配情形、（如消費地點、用途、姓名及地址、買主或受託貨物者等）、（九）備註、最後一項第十項、具有保證性質、文曰、「敝行竭以所知所信、證明以上各項所塡、完全無訛、而此處所述之進口物品、與敝行某月某日某號申請書中所同意之條件相合、如平準基金會發現此處所述之進口物、與該申請書中所述者、尙有不合、則敝行願將爲供給進口品而得自平準會之外滙、依照購入時之匯率、全數再行賣予平準會、敝行爲保證此處所述者於無誤、願向平準基金會提供爲該會現爲必需之此種書面憑據、（銀行簽字蓋章）」、</p>
<p>已結外滙　可予追回</p>
<p>上述第十項、關於銀行所提之保證、足見銀行對平準會所准結之匯、所負責任極大、銀行在未將申請書送達平準會之前、得先用電報申請、平準基金會在接獲雷報申請後、可即予以核准、惟以後正式收到申請書、而發現原申請之進口物、顯與條件未符、仍得撤消前核准、着令銀行向進口商追回原行核給之外匯、如不能追回時、則銀行不得不向公開市塲（即黑市）補進前所供給之外匯、而「再行賣予」平準會、至黑市匯率與平準會匯率之差額損失、須由原經手銀行負之、此種嚴格之辦法、使銀行在進口商請結外滙而向平準會申請時、必須審愼將事吾則可能遭遇無名損失、按此處所述之黑市、乃指點般非必需品進口商扒匯、出口商拋匯、投機商作祟及自有頭襯之銀行供匯之塲、因必需品進口之外滙、均由平準基金會照較長價格供給、自無取給於黑市之理、但設銀行遇到被平準會要求追還已核給外滙而不能向進口商追回時、祇得向黑市補進、歸還平準基金會、由此可知黑市暫不致消滅、但其惡劣之影響、則可漸少、因其活動之範圍、顯因必需品得向平準會申請結滙之故而縮小也、</p>
<p>審核標準　根據市况</p>
<p>關於審定結滙與吾之標準、全由平準基金會衡度實際情形而定、據外商銀行方面透露、最近平準會對米麥麵粉等結滙、已核准數批、其中麵粉計兩批、但第三批麵粉請結外滙、平準會即予拒絕、查按照行政院議決之准予進口貨物條例、麵粉原爲其中之一、但平準會竟不予核准、其用意乃平準基金會鑒於市塲上麵粉供給、已屬綽綽有餘、一時母須繼續進口、因此此舉實含有調節市塲供給之意、而寓竭力减少漏巵之義、他如米麥亦將同樣辦理、罕於煤斤一項、因來源國大抵爲法屬地、非屬英鎊或美元集團、結滙事宜、頗多考慮、要之、平準基金會所採取之審核標準、無一定之成法可循、（當然財部及行政院禁止進口與准予進口之兩條例、爲較主要之根據、）決定之權、全操於平準會之手、核准與吾、須視實際之需要、市塲之供給、等等重要因素而爲斷、但不論平準會採用若何標準、一般投機商及非必需品之進口商、決難照有利之價格向平準會求結一絲一毫之外滙、蓋平準會供滙之目的、端在維護正當貿易及防絕投機而已、</p>
<p>中中交農　候令遵辦</p>
<p>中中交農四行方面、尙未收到與外商銀行收到者相同之管理滙市命令、因此命令須由總行轉來、較費時日、一俟收到、當亦與其他友邦銀行一體台作、以策其成、至其他興業·墾業·上海·中南·大陸·臨·業金城·華僑·國華·東亞·中興等等華商銀行、無經營外滙之權、而前所未了之外滙業務、均已於上月十五日軋平、由中央銀行代爲收解淸楚、此後各該行如須經營必需品進口之供滙業務、可轉由中國交通兩行代向平準會申請中交兩行應得之佣金、完全歸於原經手之華商銀行、</p>

<h3>滬東日軍區內　日警長被狙擊　宮仲肩部中一彈　對銷橋樑大事搜查</h3>

<p>步往分署途遇狙擊</p>
<p>日領館警察署長宮仲、於昨晨八時許、率同領警磯谷一名、由警署出外、前往楊樹浦培開爾路分署視察、當時徒步而行、不料行經東漢璧禮路周家嘴路附近空地旁時、突有男子兩名、由路旁躍出、檠槍向宮仲轟擊、</p>
<p>連開五槍肩中一彈</p>
<p>宮仲當時不及　　、致死左肩即被命中一彈、嗣行兇者又連開四槍、但均未中的、乃囊械飛奔而逸、瞬即無蹤、宮仲時雖中彈、血流滿身、亟命同行之領警、飛速報告、日方獲訊後、立即派遣憲兵隊海軍陸戰隊及全體領警出動、將出事地點四週嚴密包圍、兜捕兇手、</p>

<h3>怎樣保衛我們的生命</h3>
<p>— 楊春緣</p>
<p>新秋，也是疾病最流行的季節，許多可怕的病菌，像傷寒，赤痢，瘧疾等等，在這個時期裏最活躍了。我們偶一不愼，就會罹病，痛苦萬狀，甚至有不及醫治而送掉生命的，豈不可惜？</p>
<p>鍛鍊身體，當然是避免一切疾病的根本方法。飲食的衛生，也應該格外注意。飲料用的水，要十分淸潔，而必須煮沸，不喝生水，不吃生水濃過或浸過的水果。食物要新鮮，腐敗的食物，往往有細菌寄生，切不可吃。</p>
<p>蛟蠅是各種傳染病的媒介，應該努力撲滅。掃除垃圾，排除汚水，以杜絕蚊蠅的來源。一有蚊蠅市現，立刻用蚊蟲香，滅蠅器等捕除，使以絕跡。</p>
<p>如果你們能集合幾個小朋友，組織一個衛生宣傳隊，到外邊去演講衛生的方法，表演衛生的歌劇，不是更有價直，更有意義了嗎？那不但對於社會有好處，於對自己也有許多間接的利益。</p>
<p>新秋雖是多病的季節，小朋友們只要一一去實行，便可安然度過了。即使不幸而遭到了痛苦的疾病，也應該從速請醫生治療，切勿迷信鬼神，把生命斷送了。</p>
<h3>做算術的不良習慣</h3>
<p>— 令</p>
<p>小雄和悟明的家是貼鄰，又在同校同級讀書，他們兩個都是愛玩的孩子，所以讀書的成績都不好，特別是算術，他們見了就頭痛，因此這科的成績格外低劣，到開學時還要補考。小雄的姐姐很替他們着急，趁着假期的空閒，每天上午替他們補習，在起初幾日，小雄連應用四則的加减乘除也分辨不淸，現在略爲知道了一些；悟明的程度較好，心算也很快，可是做起來，反而緩慢而錯得多，一個多月以來，他們仍沒有多大進步，小雄的姐姐極力要他們達到算術上正確而迅速的目的，隨時注意他們不進步的原因，以便改進錯誤。經一月餘的觀察，發覺他們做算術時有許多不良的習慣。</p>
<p>小雄小肯思想，一遇困難，就不加思索的不肯再做了，他只會機械的做，不會變化活用，心算又不快。在算時時常要數指，例如十叫加四，他一定要數着指的念着十四？十五，十六，……方才知道十四加四是十八。他不但要數指，而且不做乘除法時，好像背書一般的背着乘法口訣，例如二乘九，他一定要從二二得叫背起，才知二九是十八。</p>
<p>悟明的心算是很快的，但是除了口中喃喃不絕的念着口訣外，他做時不肯集中注意，不是東望西張的望着外面，就是坐着呆想。遇到較煩的地方，他會得做而沒有一些耐心，往往一問較難的除法，除到一半就不做下去了，因爲他的不肯集中注意，沒有耐心，所以，他做得反而慢得多了。</p>
<p>小雄的姐姐綜合他們的惡習慣有以下幾點：，不肯思想，二，只會機械的做，不會變化活用，三，數指，叫，背誦，五，不集中注意，六，沒有耐心。</p>
<p>小雄的姐姐想盡方法的免除他們的不良習慣，例如心算比賽啊！日常生活中金錢出入的計算啊！可是叫年來養成的惡習慣，在短時期內如何能革除呢？</p>
<p>小朋友們的算術，成績不好的大概也很多吧！我們自己來分析一下自己有些什麼不良的習慣要去除，我們要算術好，除掉敎師們負一部分責任外，我們還要隨時心算日常問題，多練習，多應用，沒有惡習慣，同時要免掉懼怕算術的心理，那麼這學期的算術成績，一定不會像上學期那樣壞了。</p>
<h3>一粒細沙</h3>
<p>— 寄塵</p>
<p>記得在小學時代，曾讀過一則很有意義的英文短篇故事，因爲它給予我的印象眞是太深，到現在仍根深蒂固地盤踞在我的腦袋裏。</p>
<p>故事的開首是寫某甲購買一隻手表，那隻表起先行走極準，一分一秒，都不差失，他自然滿心歡喜，豈料不久它越走越慢，最後竟完全停止了。</p>
<p>於是某甲帶它到他以前購買所在的鐘表商那裏去修理，想找出它不走的原因，修理的人拿了擴大鏡細細察視一番，發現齒輪間嵌着一粒細沙，他便對某甲說：「我能輕易修好你的表，我已明瞭了它致停的緣由。」於是他拿了一隻精巧的夾鉗，把沙粒輕輕取出；果然，那手表叉的的地走動了。</p>
<p>常某甲看到那粒沙的大小，尚不及一隻小號針尖時，他滿腔驚訝地說：「我眞料不到如此小的東西，能　成如此大的損害！」</p>
<p>「不錯，」修理者道，「這是一粒極小的沙；而就是爲了這緣故，綫能阻礙齒輪的活動，假使它不像針尖般大小，它決不會鑽進夾縫中去的！」</p>
<p>故事到道裏大概結束了。</p>
<p>小朋友，你行爲上，思想上，有沒有像前述故事中的沙粒呢？說謊，貪懶，偷竊，欺騙，不努力，不省儉，這些都是妨碍你學識和品行長足進步的微小沙粒呀！你要未來的前途光明，必須養成「知過不憚改」的勇氣，把表面似無足輕重而實際爲害甚大的沙粒徹底淸除；因循姑息，那是自毀有希望的將來！小朋友，請牢記着吧。</p>
<h3>老馬的自述</h3>
<p>— 湖州旅滬小學六年級學生　宋明培</p>
<p>我名叫哈羅特，是一匹戰馬。</p>
<p>當我在少年時，就被人們把我懸空吊起來，用燒紅的鐵蹄，釘在我的脚上，這時候，我是非常的痛苦。但過了幾天，我不但不覺得痛，並且走起路來，比從前舒服得多了。</p>
<p>我曾經聽見主人說過，從前有一個人，名叫伯樂，他能够知道我們行遠的能力，不差毫厘。可惜他現在已不在人世了，假使他還存在的話，我一定要去拜訪他哩！</p>
<p>我在十二歲的時候，就跟着軍隊上前綫去服務。在一個晚上，我軍大舉進攻，劇烈的戰爭開始了。當我衝進他們的防綫中，我使用我的鐵蹄，殘踏那些兇惡的人，同時，我的主人在槍林彈雨中，指輝着兵士們作戰，眞是勇不可當。在一片砲火怒吼聲中，突然一個手溜彈在我們前面爆炸了，手溜彈的碎片，傷了我主人的頭，我的腿，我抬頭一望，但見一片赤色，斷足和殘臂在空中飛舞，半晌，我的主人，光榮的爲祖國犧牲了。他臨死時。對我說：「哈羅…特，我們……永……別……了！你…你……」說到這裹，他咽哽着，說不出話，淚珠兒連串的滾下來。我在傷痛之餘，不免做了他們的俘虜。但是我不忘記主人的仇恨！不忘記祖國所受的恥辱！</p>
<p>天漸漸黑了，他們營裏寂寞無聲了。我見有隙可乘，便用盡了全身的氣力，把韁繩咬斷，從他營裏逃出來，回到我軍防綫裹，不一會，我被送到戰地醫院去醫治。</p>
<p>過了幾天，我的腿傷好了，又到前錢去服務，爲國家出了不少的力。後來因爲年老了，新主人不忍放我上戰塲，所以我現在在馬廄裏休養，每天仍舊有許多食料給我吃，所以我的晚境，也大堪自娛了。</p>
<h3>妹妹生病了</h3>
<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>不知怎的，阿亮的妹妹在上學期日的下午，忽然連夜飯也不要吃，要躺到牀上去睡覺，母親見了伊這種精神，當然知道伊一定覺得有些不舒服，吾則伊怎麼會肯不吃這一頓夜飯呢？在平日，伊吃了兩碗，還嫌不够，再要添上小半碗，母親的　量竟也不及伊哩。一天到晚，很活潑的在弄堂裏跟隣家的孩子們一同玩耍，而現在竟要到牀上去睡，夜　也不想吃了，這不是好現象。不錯，母親在伊的小額角上一摸，只覺得有一陣子熱，伊是有寒熱了。更叫阿明把量身體溫度的寒熱表挿在伊嘴裏的舌頭底下，過了一分鐘，拿出來一看，水銀柱竟昇高了兩度多。這樣便害得母親忙起來：叫妹妹聞痧藥，吃枳實，更叫女傭人到藥店裏去買午時茶來煎，買些皮硝紫穌放在布帶裏縛在肚子上：母親還喃喃地嚷着：「伊定是寒食相鬬，平日受足了寒，又多吃了東　。」所以凡是阿亮家裹所有的人一患了些小毛病，必先經過母親所信託這消食解寒的四種國樂來調治，有時還要在後頸上扭痧，有三條明顯的紅痕印在那裏，這雖很痛苦。據母親說是出出氣的。這决妹妹本來也要嘗到這種滋味，但妹妹是頂怕痛的，因此母親也不十分勉强伊，換了別人，伊老人家是不肯饒赦的，非扭痧不可。妹妹是佔了在阿亮兄弟姊妹行中最小一個的便宜。到了妹妹臨睡的時候，還吃了半片阿司匹靈藥片，使便伊在晚上大大地出一身汗，一到明天，寒熱便有退去的可能。　「爸爸，妹妹的熱度高了兩度多，那到底是幾度呀？」阿亮問着他的父親。　「普通人身體的溫度是華氏九十八度點叫，現在妹妹的體溫到了一百度左右，於是伊便覺得怕風，鼻子和嘴裏有些熱烘烘地，飯又吃不進了，精神也不好了，只想睡覺。」</p>
<p>「爸爸，你剛才量的，恐怕有些不準確罷？因爲空氣的溫度比了身體來得低；那隻表一碰到冷，水銀柱不會降下嗎？」</p>
<p>「你說得一些也不錯，確是耍降下的，這在剛發明寒熱表來量體溫的時候，便發現你所說的弊病，但是現在你瞧這隻寒熱表近水銀球的地方，突然細了起來，這爲什麼？就是使升高的水銀柱不致受到其他的影響而降低；這樣便可測得準確的體溫，所以寒熱表不可用作測氣候的寒暑表，因爲它上升容易而降下困難。……他的父親還想講下去，這時母親叫他們倆不要多講了，以免驚動生病的妹妹，於是他老人家答允他下决冉繼續下去。</p>

<h3>楊寳森再度掛一牌　（下）</h3>
<p>— 少閒（自北平寄）</p>
<p>「不過在天津方面正在邀我，如果寳森願意的話，我們不妨先在天津合作起來，將來再去上海豈不更好？」瑤卿也領會了硯秋的意思，爺兒倆又說了一會兒，硯秋告辭走了，此事不提，再談談楊寳森方面，寳森近來在北方出演，頗有起色，藝術也日見進步。黃金方面，早就想邀他去演，因爲前年寳森在上海的時候，還收過黃金一筆定洋，不過黃金當局認爲寶森掛頭牌，二牌旦角非邀黃桂秋或侯玉蘭不可。黃侯二人的包銀都很可觀，開銷大了，很難盈餘，如果旦角差一點，又恐不能號召，所以他們決定還是邀寶森和硯秋同來。寳森自己的意思呢，因爲已經掛了一年多的頭牌，再掛二牌，好像面子上不大好看。而且二脾的包銀，當然要比頭牌少，所以不願意答應。在寳森請上海來的黃金當局金孫二位在豐澤園吃飯的那天，他在席前就表示過自己的意思，後來金孫一位，因此一度想改邀遲世恭，但是因爲世恭的個子矮小，與硯秋搭配不大合宜，於是此意打消，叉重與寶森接洽。寶森的友好都觀他和硯秋合作，瑤卿出好把自己的意思對寳森說說過，再加上實森和黃金素有友誼，於是終久在九千元鉅額包銀之下，寶森表示願意接受與硯秋合作。同時因爲寶森硯秋上海之局成功，天津方面也繼上海之後，將硯秋寶森邀妥，日內寶森即將隨硯秋去津出演中國戲院，演罷或即由津赴滬。此决硯秋南來，陣容更見齊整，非特老生易王少樓爲楊寳森，而且與硯秋拆擋三年之兪振飛，將重行與硯秋携手，提起程兪二家之事，說來話長，叉要下回分解。</p>

<h3>U.S. Senate Passes National Revenue Act for Defense</h3>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 6th—Yesterday, the Senate passed an unprecedented National Revenue Act, which has been sent back to the House of Representatives for reconsideration of the Senate amendments. The act stipulates a revenue of $3,583,900,000 to meet the huge expenses of national defense. This figure is $367,500,000 more than that recently passed by the House. The increased amount is mostly due to the Senate's revision of income tax exemptions. Previously, married individuals with an annual income of $1,000 and unmarried individuals with an annual income of $800 were exempt from income tax. Now, the Senate has reduced $2,000 to $1,500 and $800 to $700.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air and Naval Forces Search for Submarines in Various Parts of the North Atlantic; Nearby British Aircraft Assist in the Search; Suspect German Submarine that Attacked the Greer May Be Damaged or Sunk</h3>
<p>Washington, International News Service, 6th—Yesterday, the Navy Department dispatched a large number of battleships, cruisers, destroyers, aircraft carriers, naval aircraft, etc., to patrol the waters of New England, Newfoundland, and Iceland, in search of the submarine that attacked the British ship Greer. This action was taken upon the direct order of President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 6th—It is reported that the crew members of the U.S. destroyer Greer stated yesterday that the attacking submarine may have been sunk or at least damaged. Rumors indicate that nearby British aircraft assisted in the search. According to dispatches from the capital of Iceland, the attacker was a German submarine. According to the instruments on board the Greer, the U.S. ship was directly above the submarine when the depth charges were dropped.</p>
<p>Hoke稚未克, United Press, 6th—The U.S. destroyer Greer, which was attacked by a submarine in the waters off Island the day before yesterday, arrived here yesterday. However, the authorities have prohibited the press from speaking with the ship's officers. All journalists and non-official personnel gathered at the wharf are not allowed to board the ship.</p>
<p>Philadelphia, United Press, 6th—Officials here announced yesterday that the U.S. ship Greer is one of the 59 old-style destroyers that were recommissioned at the beginning of the European war in 1939. They claimed that the ship has been in active service for six years since then.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Remarks</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 6th—Yesterday, President Roosevelt, at a press conference, answered questions regarding the attack on the U.S. destroyer Greer by a submarine. He stated that the 1,094-ton destroyer Greer, which was carrying mail to Iceland, was attacked by a submarine more than once. It was daytime, the visibility was quite clear, and the location was definitely on the American side of the Atlantic. The ship was clearly marked and flew the American flag. It was sailing alone when it was attacked. As for how many times the Greer was attacked, the President did not specify, nor did he say whether the multiple attacks occurred within a relatively short period on Thursday morning or were separated by some time. The President also declined to discuss the location where the attack occurred. A reporter asked what would be done if the attacker were found. The President replied that he believed the U.S. warships would annihilate it. He was very fortunate that the Greer was not hit. He could not say why the submarine's shooting aim was so poor. He did not want to disclose whether the submarine's periscope was above the water, nor could he discuss it. The President expressed approval of the Greer's captain dropping depth charges, without a doubt. A reporter asked if a submarine could mistake a ship at a distance where it launches torpedoes during the daytime. The President replied that what he could clarify was that if a submarine had its periscope above the water, there would be no reason to mistake a ship. We must know that torpedoes are mostly launched using periscopes. However, submarines from all countries, including Germany and Italy, are equipped with hydrophones that can launch torpedoes by sound, although it is not as accurate as using a periscope. A reporter asked if the President would place the Greer incident in the category of a shooting war. The President replied that this was a hypothetical question and he was unable to answer it. The reporter also asked if the Greer was attacked in the American side of the Atlantic, but also in the war zone declared by Germany. The President replied that the United States had never received a notice regarding the demarcation of such a war zone. The reporter further asked if the Greer's immediate dropping of depth charges was done in accordance with instructions. The President replied that there was no information to the contrary. He asked how the reporters would have responded if they were in the same position and under attack. At the beginning of the press conference, the President whispered to his naval aide for a moment before mentioning the Greer incident, stating that the criticism from some people in Washington reminded him of a story. Previously, children were shot at by someone hiding in the woods on their way to school. Their parents and children were not hit, so they took no action, believing there was no reason to search the woods or take other steps. A reporter interjected, "So, are we searching the woods now?" The President replied, "Yes, and you could say the principal (meaning the President) is currently investigating this matter." A reporter then asked if the attack on the Greer had caused any changes to the instructions given to U.S. warships. The President replied, "No." A reporter asked if the attack would be used as a basis for diplomatic action. The President remained silent.</p>
<p>U.S. Warships Receive Alert, Exercise Caution Against Maritime Raids</p>
<p>Washington, Reuters, 6th—All American newspapers have printed the news of the Greer's attack in large font, with many expressing concern that American ships will continue to be attacked by submarines. One news agency stated that American warships in the Atlantic have received a warning from the Navy Department, urging them to exercise caution against maritime Axis raids. A Washington afternoon newspaper carried a full-page editorial on its front page entitled "Now is the Time to Stop Hitler," stating in brief: "Hitler will likely take this as an act of war, or create a shooting war or war, which one is it, we do not know. But there is not much difference between the two. What we do know is that even if the Germans do not fire the first shot now, they will definitely do so in the future. Now is the time for us to act." Pratt, a military expert from the New York Times, wrote that the German submarine deliberately attacked the American destroyer, knowing full well that it was an American destroyer, since people in naval circles are familiar with the form of the destroyer Greer and would never mistake it for another ship. The New York Post collected opinions from various circles in the United States regarding this incident. The results showed that general public sentiment was mostly calm, adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Some also said that there was no definite proof of which country's submarine it was, and others said that it must have been a case of mistaken identity. Some quarters in Washington stated that American ships traveling to and from Iceland are now so frequent that it is almost impossible to avoid conflicts with German ships. This matter will not worsen relations between the United States and Germany, but similar incidents may continue to occur in the future; this is only the beginning. People in Congress believe that the Greer did not engage in combat, only exercising the instructions to defend itself when attacked. Such friction will surely bring the United States and its sentiments into alignment. When the sentiments are aligned, the authorities will be able to take further action to restrain the Axis powers. American newspapers carried a dispatch from Berlin stating that Berlin knew nothing about this matter.</p>
<p>British Officials Remain Silent, Germany Claims U.S. is Inciting</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 6th—Yesterday, the attention of British people was focused on the news from the United States regarding the attack on the American destroyer Greer by a German submarine. However, Reuters' diplomatic correspondent heard from London officials yesterday that this was purely an event between the U.S. and Germany, and the British side would not comment on it. The public here previously thought that Germany, in accordance with Hitler's policy of defeating them individually, was trying its best to avoid conflict with the United States. Therefore, they were quite surprised that the attack on the American ship had occurred.</p>
<p>London, United Press, 6th—Some morning newspapers today stated that the attack on the American ship Greer in the North Atlantic was Germany's first direct challenge to the United States. The newspapers stated that a large number of hesitant people in the United States have now realized, whether they like it or not, that "this is the most complete meaning of the war for the United States." President Roosevelt's statement that the submarine will be captured has been printed in large font by all morning newspapers. The news of the Greer incident has overshadowed the war news from the Soviet Union. The Daily Mail stated that any words that might suggest the matter can be considered closed have been swept away by President Roosevelt. The Daily Telegraph stated, "Now it only remains to see Berlin's statement of its attitude."</p>
<p>Berlin, International News Service, 6th—German sources charged that the reported attack on the American ship Greer by a submarine in the Atlantic was a deliberate act of inciting war. One official spokesman speculated that the attack on the American ship was done by the British. There is extreme suspicion here regarding the incident. The general public believes that this matter is being used as wartime propaganda, with the goal of inciting the American people.</p>
<p>Rome, United Press, 6th—Roman newspapers did not print a single word about the attack on the American ship Greer in the Atlantic yesterday. The general tendency here is to downplay the news. Before an official announcement is made, there will be no comments from official circles.</p>
<h3>Another U.S. Oil Tanker Continues to Arrive at Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Germany Claims Japan Remains Loyal to the Tripartite Pact; Attitude Adopted Remains to Be Seen in the Future</p>
<p>New York, United Press, 6th—The United Tide Oil Company stated that the 8,428-ton oil tanker "United" has arrived in Vladivostok, carrying aviation fuel.</p>
<p>New York, Havas, 6th—According to announcements here, another American oil tanker has safely arrived in Vladivostok, and several more will arrive successively within ten days.</p>
<p>Berlin, United Press, 6th—German authoritative circles stated yesterday that Japan's entire policy is based on the Tripartite Pact. Regarding the reports from the United States that an American oil tanker has arrived in Vladivostok, they stated that if speaking of the first oil tanker arriving there, then one should say "an oil tanker" has arrived there. They also said that the United States is using this as a test of how Japan will react; the attitude adopted remains to be seen in the future.</p>
<p>Lyon, Havas, 5th—After the first American oil tanker safely arrived in Vladivostok, "The Times" recently commented that this matter is an extremely subtle test of current U.S.-Japan relations. That Japan did not prevent the American oil tanker from passing through the sea it controls to its destination shows that the Japanese government still wants to leave some room for forming an agreement with Britain and the United States in the future.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Hai Tung News Agency, 6th—According to the Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's opposition to American munitions being transported from Manila to the Soviet Union is the same as its opposition to transportation from Vladivostok. Five Soviet cargo ships currently in Shanghai intend to pick up munitions that have arrived in Manila. A spokesman for the Japanese government, Wei An, stated on Friday that the passage of these ships through Japanese territorial waters is no different from the passage of ships from the U.S. to Vladivostok through Japanese territorial waters. Therefore, Japan holds the same attitude towards both routes. The Japanese public has also expressed its opinion, believing that the American plan to establish a supply line from Alaska to the Soviet Union is another step in encircling Japan. Japanese newspapers have all launched fierce attacks against this.</p>
<h3>Military Weapons Privately Stored in Bangkok Japanese Hotel; Manager Arrested</h3>
<p>Singapore, United Press, 6th—Travelers from Thailand stated that Thai authorities seized military weapons and hand grenades from a hotel opened by a Japanese person in Bangkok and arrested the hotel's manager.</p>
<p>Singapore, Reuters, 6th—According to non-official sources from Thailand arriving here, Japanese people in Bangkok are behaving domineeringly, as if they are the masters of Bangkok. They go to restaurants and eat lavishly, paying with Japanese currency after the meal. When the waiters ask them to pay in Thai baht, they turn a deaf ear and say to the waiters, "Japanese currency will soon be used without obstruction here." Also, when customs officers inspect luggage, the Japanese people are impatient and say to the inspectors, "Don't make trouble for yourself; soon you will salute me instead of bothering me like this." Such incidents occur frequently. Because Thailand is maintaining neutrality, newspapers cannot speak out openly. However, this kind of unsettling news has spread throughout Thai society, causing Thais to feel very uneasy.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Joint Administration Decides to Increase Loan Amount for Industry and Mining; Lending Methods Also Finalized; Maximizing Promotion of Rear Production</h3>
<p>Chongqing—The Joint Administration Office of the Chungking Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture Banks is providing assistance to various well-organized, high-quality, important state-owned and private industrial and mining enterprises in need of working capital. Over the past two years, the industrial loans approved by the office have amounted to tens of millions of yuan, benefiting factories and mines throughout the rear provinces. Recently, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to promote the industrial production of the rear, has requested the four banks to increase the loan amount to assist the industrial and mining industries in various provinces, such as the turnover of working capital, the purchase of slow-moving products, and the borrowing of funds against orders. It is estimated that 60 million yuan will be needed within this year. The Four Banks Joint Administration has finalized the following methods: (1) Regarding loans for assisting working capital, the past method of collecting interest will continue to be used. Each factory and mine will submit a statement to the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, clearly stating the amount of the loan application, the purpose, and the collateral. After the department has reviewed and signed its opinion, the Four Banks Joint Administration will then approve each case individually. (2) As for loans for purchasing slow-moving products, the Steel and Iron Management Committee will be responsible for the overall planning of the purchase loans for gray cast iron and white cast iron. The Fuel Management Office will be responsible for the overall planning of the purchase loans for coal. The Price Equalization Purchase and Sales Office will be responsible for the overall planning of the purchase loans for daily necessities such as toothbrushes, soap, leather, and native paper. (3) Regarding the borrowing of funds against contracts for custom-made products, the competent authorities will negotiate detailed methods and handle them at any time. There is no limit to the amount of the above three types of loans. (Chongqing, 6th)</p>
<h3>Central Trust Bureau to Establish More Branches</h3>
<p>Chongqing—Due to the expansion of its business, the Central Trust Bureau has decided to establish branches in Chengdu, Guiyang, Guilin, and Hengyang. Each branch will have four departments: document management, business, cashier, and accounting. The main business of the Trust Bureau is insurance, savings, and purchasing supplies on behalf of various agencies. Recently, it has also been ordered that all non-military supplies imported via the Burma Road will be managed by the Bureau. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Guilin War Bond Drive Achieves Excellent Results</h3>
<p>Guilin—As of the 5th, the war bond drive in Guilin has raised more than 3.6 million yuan. There are still more than 70 teams continuing to solicit donations in different areas. It is expected that the original target amount will be exceeded. Huang Xuchu, the head of the war bond drive, has scheduled a reception for the team leaders on the 7th and will present special awards to the sub-teams that have exceeded the original target amount by more than double, in order to provide encouragement.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Zhang Jiluan</h3>
<p>We have just received a telegram from Chongqing that Mr. Zhang Jiluan, the chief editor of Ta Kung Pao, passed away due to illness at 4:00 AM yesterday. Although the importance of this news cannot compare to the telegrams regarding U.S.-Japan relations or the German-Soviet war, from the perspective of China, especially from the perspective of the Chinese press, this is indeed a very significant piece of news. This is because Mr. Zhang is not only a pioneer of the Chinese newspaper industry, but is truly a figure who best represents Chinese public opinion and best expresses the national will. Mr. Zhang's daily remarks have not only deeply penetrated all levels of society, but can also be said to have considerably permeated the ruling class. Even Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally regarded Mr. Zhang as a candid friend. In front of the Chairman, he was often able to say what his aides dared not or could not say. This alone shows how much Mr. Zhang's personality and learning were respected by the Chinese authorities and society.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiluan was only 55 years old this year, but he devoted himself to the newspaper industry for at least 30 years. After returning from studying in Japan, he worked in the Shanghai press, working with Mr. Yu Youren, Mr. Shao Lizi, Mr. Ye Chucang, and others. His most successful career was undoubtedly taking over Ta Kung Pao in Tianjin from the 15th year of the Republic of China. But in reality, the foundation for his success was established long before he took over Ta Kung Pao: he had a lifelong ambition to serve the newspaper industry, so although he constantly had close ties with politics throughout his life, he always regarded rank and honor as discarded shoes, remaining a scholar at heart for 40 years. He also had a passion for loving the country, loving society, and loving mankind, so his articles were always so emotional and full of flesh and blood. I remember that after the Xi'an Incident occurred, Mr. Zhang wrote an article advising the two generals Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng. The entire article revealed a sincere emotion of loving the country, loving the leader, and also caring for Zhang and Yang. The authorities printed this article as a single sheet and used airplanes to distribute it over Xi'an to influence the soldiers in the city. It cannot be said that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's safe escape was not due to this to some extent. Also, in the past, when the Guangdong-Guangxi problem became increasingly rigid, and the central government was almost prepared to use force against Guangxi, Mr. Zhang's articles shouted daily for unified resistance against foreign aggression and avoidance of civil war. As a result, it was resolved peacefully, demonstrating the great power of the press. In other cases, such as the case of the seven gentlemen of the National Salvation Association before the war, Mr. Zhang also did not avoid suspicion or fear difficulties, repeatedly appealing to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and other authorities for rescue, and finally restored the freedom of the seven. All of this is enough to prove that Mr. Zhang is not only a famous reporter who writes well and has superior vision, but also an elder who is sincere in emotion and truly loves the country and society. He loved young people and always wanted to support younger generations. He despised money and knew nothing of enjoyment. He was not afraid of power and had been imprisoned in Beiping in the past for criticizing the authorities. He had the demeanor of a scholar, and his treatment of people always made people feel approachable in the winter. These are all from a private perspective. From the perspective of the country, his greatest contribution to the nation was undoubtedly his major contribution to supporting the cause of resistance and reconstruction over the past four years. He advocated fighting to the end, he believed that fighting would surely succeed, and he also constantly called for unity. His understanding of the international situation was extremely profound. He always believed that the world situation would be favorable to China, and his beliefs and judgments have now almost all been realized. However, the heavens did not bless him, and he was taken away before this old reporter could witness victory. This is not only a great loss to the Chinese press, but also a great misfortune to the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang was diagnosed with second-stage lung disease eight years ago. With his so thin and weak body, he should have rested early and should never have traveled long distances or engaged in writing again. However, based on his loyalty to the country and his passion for the newspaper industry, not only was he unwilling to rest, but he instead traveled between Chongqing and Hong Kong over the past four years, constantly working for the country and fulfilling his duties to the people. His passing, although like a bolt from the blue, had long been worried about by his friends, especially those who had advised him to rest. His spirit of giving his all is not only a model for the national newspaper industry, but also a model that everyone should follow. In our extreme mourning, we can only firmly remember Mr. Zhang's dying words, "Strive for the country with a positive spirit," so as not to fail this great figure of the newspaper industry who dedicated himself to the country! Finally, we respectfully extend our most sincere condolences to the colleagues of Ta Kung Pao and Mr. Zhang's family, who are far away in Chongqing and Hong Kong!</p>
<h3>Heavy Fighting Near Ruicheng, Jinan for Several Days; Invading Japanese Troops Driven Back; Repeated Reinforcements of Japanese Troops from Yunxiang, Monan Fail; Successful Attacks by Chinese Troops in Western Zhejiang, Repeatedly Capture Important Strongholds</h3>
<p>Chongqing News from the Military, (1) A part of the Japanese troops in Ruicheng, Jinan triangle area, attacked Wangyao Village and Fotian Village on the evening of August 28th, and continued to increase on the morning of the 29th. They fiercely attacked Majia Hua and Yongxing Yao areas through Dongxi Yuedi and Yangjia Village for a whole day. After strong resistance from the Chinese troops, they ultimately failed. At 1 pm, the Japanese troops from Monan Town passed through Shihuyao to the west and joined the attack, intensifying the battle. By evening, the Japanese troops in Yuxiang and Qinghua Town also moved south, attempting to encircle the Chinese troops. The Chinese troops immediately contained the Japanese troops advancing from Rui and Mo, while simultaneously engaging the Japanese troops attacking south from Yuxiang and Qinghua. Except for encountering the Japanese troops in Liuluyacun in the morning, the Chinese troops fought bravely and eventually drove back the Japanese troops. In this battle, the Chinese troops fought fiercely with the Japanese troops for two days, killing and wounding more than 300 Japanese troops, and captured many prisoners. (2) The Japanese troops fighting against the Chinese troops near Zuosongbu Zhisheng Mountain and other places suffered more than 200 casualties from the Chinese troops until the evening of the 4th. The Japanese troops were already showing signs of collapse. The Chinese forces are stepping up their attack. (3) A part of the Japanese troops north of Foshan attempted to advance from Fengyong towards Xiaobubincheng on the morning of August 31st. After the Chinese troops dispatched a team to attack them fiercely, they retreated with injuries by noon. (Telegraph from the 4th)</p>
<p>A certain place in Western Zhejiang The Japanese troops who counterattacked the Chinese troops from the three routes of Changxing, Wuxing, and Wukang have been repelled by the Chinese troops. (1) 2,000 Japanese troops from Changxing pounced on Hushan, Baduling, and Linchengqiao areas, suffering a heavy blow from the Chinese troops, with numerous casualties. However, a group of Japanese troops from Linchengqiao reinforced and attacked Shenxizhen to the west, attempting to attack Anji City. After being blocked by the Chinese troops, they retreated towards Qiankengqiao. (2) More than 1,000 Japanese troops from Wuxing sneaked to Qiankengqiao via Hepingzhen, Xiaojinzhen, and Jiangjiabian. After the two routes of Japanese troops met and attacked Qiankengqiao, the Chinese troops launched an attack and forced them to retreat. (3) More than 1,000 Japanese troops from Wukang attacked Paitouzhen to the west on the 2nd, ostensibly to respond to the invading Japanese troops from Wuxing and Changxing, but were blocked by the Chinese troops and retreated with injuries. (Telegraph from the 4th)</p>
<p>Jinhua The Japanese troops who harassed Anji, Qiankengqiao, Meixizhen, Hepingzhen, and other places were attacked by the Chinese troops. On the 3rd and 4th, the Chinese troops successively recovered various places. The Japanese troops retreated towards Wukang, and the Chinese troops are still pursuing them. (Telegraph from the 5th)</p>
<h3>The Recovery of Fuzhou Is of Great Significance</h3>
<p>Washington The Washington Star published an article stating that the recovery of Fuzhou by the Chinese troops is not only of great local significance. If the Chinese troops can maintain control of Fuzhou, or further expand their victories, China can increase an important transportation line for overseas supplies, thereby enhancing China's military strength and making a large-scale counter-offensive easier to achieve. (Telegraph from the 5th)</p>
<p>Nanping The Chinese troops have completely recovered the coastal areas and continue to attack and sweep away small islands in the sea. The county governments of Minhou, Fuyuan, Lianjiang, and Changle have returned to their respective cities to work, expedite the work of comforting and rehabilitating the people, and reorganize.

<p>Fuzhou The Japanese troops occupied Fuzhou. This time, the Chinese troops launched a counter-offensive, advancing simultaneously from three sides. Within a few days, the Japanese troops were defeated and retreated into the sea. When the Chinese troops attacked along the Minjiang River from the east bank of the Minjiang River on the evening of the 2nd, they captured Tongkou Town, which is more than 20 miles away from Fuzhou City, breaking through the strong fortifications built by the Japanese troops there, including many artillery positions. More than 300 artillery shells were abandoned, all of which were seized by the Chinese troops. At that time, it was midnight on the 2nd. The Chinese troops pursued through the night and approached Hongshan Bridge at dawn, only a few miles away from the city. The troops on the left and right banks of the river also attacked and entered the two cities of Fuqing and Lianjiang after a week of fierce fighting. The Japanese troops were surrounded on three sides, and there was a risk of their retreat being cut off, so they retreated in a panic. After the Chinese troops entered the city, they searched out many important official documents in the agencies they occupied. When the Japanese troops retreated, they set fire in the city, but it was immediately extinguished by the Chinese troops. The electric lights were not greatly damaged, and the city continued to be illuminated on the night of the 4th. The original printing equipment of the Southern Daily was also preserved, and the newspaper has now been republished. (Telegraph from the 5th)</p>
<p>Shangrao On the morning of the 3rd, a part of the Japanese troops from Anmei in northern Jiangxi attempted to disturb the Songbu area.

More than ten armored boats were sunk, and many Japanese officers and soldiers were drowned. Subsequently, the Japanese reinforcements increased to more than 1,400 people and forcibly crossed the river. They are currently confronting the Chinese troops near Songbu.

<h3>Zhang Jiluan, Editor of Ta Kung Pao, Passes Away in the Suburbs of Chongqing; His Will Encourages Colleagues to Actively Fight for the Country; Chiang Kai-shek and Minister Wang Send Condolences to His Family</h3>
<p>Chongqing Zhang Jiluan, chief writer of Ta Kung Pao, recently passed away at 4 am on the 6th due to severe lung disease and treatment in the Central Hospital on August 31st.</p>
<p>Zhang's Brief Biography</p>
<p>His name was Chizhang, a native of Yulin, Shaanxi, born in Shandong, 55 years old. At the age of fifteen, he returned to Shaanxi from Shandong to study, and then went to Japan to study. He returned to China in the Xinhai Revolution and served as a reporter for Minli Daily. In the first year of the establishment of the provisional government, he briefly served as a secretary. Soon after, he entered the newspaper industry. In the second year, he co-founded the Beijing-Tianjin Minli Daily with Cao Chengfu (father of Cao Gubing, manager of the Chongqing edition of Ta Kung Pao). Due to the campaign against Yuan Shikai, the newspaper was temporarily damaged, and he was also imprisoned. After being released, he went to Shanghai and served as a professor at China Public School. In the fourth year, he hosted the Minxin Daily in Shanghai. In the fifth year, Yuan Shikai died, and Li Yuanhong succeeded as president. He returned to the north and presided over the writing of Zhonghua Xinbao. In the eighth year, he hosted the Shanghai Zhonghua Xinbao. After three years, he returned to the north. In the fifteenth year, he took over the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao with Wu Daquan and Hu Zhengzhi. In the twenty-seventh year, he served as a senator in the first National参政会. This year, he was re-elected as a senator in the second National参政会. He was forthright, full of youthful spirit, and devoted his life to the newspaper industry, vowing to be loyal and brave. He was loyal to his own views, while widely adopting multiple opinions, so his arguments were unshakeable, but without prejudice. He took preparing for failure as the secret of running a newspaper, so he was bold in publishing, dared to speak frankly, and did not follow others. Even if it was far from the authorities' intentions and did not conform to social atmosphere, he would strive for the truth and would not change. All of this can be seen from the importance attached to the Ta Kung Pao editorials at home and abroad. Usually, he did not omit any details of other people's opinions, information from all parties, and what he saw and heard, and then thought deeply before writing his articles. His profound knowledge was respected by his peers. At that time, famous figures such as Yu Youren and Chen Bulei were especially close to him. In addition to his lofty discussions and grand ideas, he was fond of Kunqu opera. After drinking and getting tipsy, he would sing loudly, and his enthusiasm did not diminish with age. He had suffered from lung disease for a long time, and his accumulated hard work has made the disease even worse. He recently lived in Nanan for recuperation, but there was no improvement. He also suffered from pleurisy, and the doctor declared it incurable. In recent days, due to breathing difficulties, he was given oxygen several times. In the afternoon of the 5th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek visited him in the hospital. Before his death, Yu Youren, Chen Bulei, and Xiao Zhenying served as witnesses to his will. This newspaper giant has laid down his pen and passed away, which is not only a loss to the newspaper industry, but also a loss to the country and the nation. The coffin was sealed at 4 pm on the 6th. Friends and relatives who came to pay their respects included Yu Youren, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Chen Bulei, Gan Naiguang, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Xiaoyan, Chen Bosheng, Xiao Tongzi, Kang Xinru, and Kang Xinzhi, more than fifty people in total. The spirit will be temporarily suspended in a certain place in the suburbs of Chongqing, and will be moved back to his original home after the autumn cools down. People from all walks of life were deeply saddened upon hearing the news and plan to hold a memorial service in the coming days. The full text of Zhang's will is recorded below.</p>
<p>Full Text of Will</p>
<p>I have made running a newspaper my only profession in my life. Since the Xinhai Revolution, I have always strived to fulfill my duties as a journalist, hoping to contribute to the country and the nation. Since the September 18th Incident, I have always aimed to restore the independence and freedom of our country and nation. At the same time, I deeply believe that we must unite as a country, support the leader, support the government, be loyal to ourselves, and fight hard to achieve this goal. Therefore, I have always encouraged my colleagues to be respectful in their work and work tirelessly. Now is the fifth year of the war, and victory is in sight. However, my illness will not get better. I would like to reiterate this and hope that all my colleagues in the company will deeply feel the difficulties of the times and the importance of their responsibilities. Based on this policy, we will work together to achieve complete success. We should pay attention to our health at all times and fight for the country with a positive spirit. As for the education of my children and the livelihood of my family, I believe that my close friends will be able to plan for me. I have no sadness or worries. I will not repeat myself. Witnesses: Yu Youren, Chen Bulei, Gan Naiguang, Xiao Zhenying, Wang Pengsheng, Kang Xinru, Kang Xinzhi, Wang Lu, Chen Bosheng, Shao Yulin, Wang Jiazeng, Xiao Tongzi, Cao Shuming, Wang Yuzhen, Zhang Chen Xiaoxia, Qu Wu, Wang Yunsheng, Wang Jiejie.

<p>Chongqing After the death of Zhang Jiluan, chief editor of Ta Kung Pao, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Minister Wang of the Central Propaganda Department sent telegrams to his family on the 6th to express their condolences. The following are two telegrams. (Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's telegram), Ta Kung Pao to Madam Zhang, Mr. Jiluan was a master of his generation, sincerely loved the country, forgot his hard work and accumulated fatigue, leading to the exhaustion of his body. His handshake was still warm, and I suddenly heard of his passing. Such a person will not be made again, the world mourns. The sadness cannot be exhausted. I especially send my condolences and hope you will restrain your grief. Chiang Kai-shek Fish. (Telegram from Minister Wang and others) Ta Kung Pao to Madam Zhang, Mr. Jiluan was a famous figure in the forum, admired for his high character. He discussed politics in the central government and devoted himself to national affairs. However, due to accumulated hard work, he became ill and suddenly passed away. His words are still in our ears, but the person is far away. The sadness is unbearable. I especially send my condolences and hope you will restrain your grief. Tu Shijie, Pan Gongzhan, Dong Xianguang, Fish. (Telegraph from the 6th)</p>
<p>Guiyang The news of the death of Zhang Chizhang, chief editor of Ta Kung Pao, came just as Hu Zhengzhi, general manager of the newspaper, arrived in Guiyang. He told reporters that he took over Ta Kung Pao with Mr. Zhang and Mr. Wu Daquan fifteen years ago. Mr. Zhang was in charge of the writing, and he worked extremely hard. After the outbreak of the war, Mr. Zhang was in charge of the Wuhan and Chongqing editions, and I was in charge of the Hong Kong and Guilin editions, and it was very difficult to meet. This spring, we met in Hong Kong and planned to come to Guilin in the autumn to have a pleasant conversation with Wu and discuss future plans. Unexpectedly, this wish was not fulfilled, and Mr. Zhang became ill from overwork. After receiving the news in Guilin, I immediately wanted to fly to Chongqing, but I could not get a flight for many days. I then changed to a postal car and rushed to Guiyang, and suddenly heard the bad news, and I was extremely saddened. I am now preparing to go to Chongqing tomorrow morning to preside over the funeral arrangements. The reporter then went to comfort Mr. Wu Daquan. According to him, Mr. Zhang's death is not only heartbreaking for friends, but also a major loss to the country. Mr. Zhang devoted his life to the newspaper industry, and his achievements should be enough to comfort him. It is a pity that Mr. Zhang has been working hard for the war of resistance in recent years, and God did not grant him the years to witness the arrival of victory. There should be no regrets. In addition, Wang Yaming, Xiao Weimin, and Yan Shenyu of the Guiyang press also sent telegrams to Mr. Zhang's family to express their condolences. (Telegraph from the 6th)</p>
<h3>Chinese War Films Screened in Thailand</h3>
<p>Chongqing News from the Chinese side today said that the Japanese authorities in Thailand recently attempted to ban Chinese war films without success. The Japanese side requested the Thai government to ban Thai cinemas from screening the Chinese film "Baptism of Fire", but was rejected by the Thai authorities. The Japanese side's reason was that the film was a war film produced by the Chongqing side. The film is currently being screened in a famous Chinese theater in Bangkok.

<h3>German Long-Range Artillery Bombards Leningrad Fiercely; Two Million Residents Mobilized to Fight the Enemy Together; Fierce Counter-Offensive by the Red Army in Gomel</h3>
<p>Havas Agency dispatch from Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 6th: According to Soviet war reports, the Red Army in the north is now desperately preventing the German army from advancing towards Leningrad. The battle situation is fierce in the Novograd district, 60 miles south of the city, and west of Lake Ilmen. There is also fierce fighting north of the city. The German army is advancing along the road to Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. The vanguard is only five miles away from Leningrad and is encountering unprecedented resistance from the Red Army. German long-range artillery can now bombard the city, and German warplanes are constantly bombing Soviet bases in the Gulf of Finland. As for the central front, the Red Army has launched counter-offensives in Smolensk, Bryansk, and Gomel.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from New York, 6th: The Battle of Leningrad entered its sixteenth day yesterday. Two million residents in the city have been mobilized, and the German army has begun to bombard the city with heavy artillery. According to the Moscow official report, several teams of people's defense volunteers directly engaged in combat with the Nazi invaders and repelled the Germans. It also stated that the Soviet army initially allowed Nazi tanks to enter the rear of the Soviet army, and the Soviet army concentrated its fire on the German infantry closely following the tanks. All the tanks were later destroyed. Berlin admitted encountering fierce Soviet resistance in Leningrad. Well-informed sources said that the German army may be unwilling to destroy Leningrad because the city is very useful to Germany.</p>
<p>Havas Agency dispatch from Helsinki, 5th: According to the Finnish Intelligence Agency, a large fire has broken out in Leningrad, and the flames are visible from the Finnish coast.</p>
<p>Havas Agency dispatch from a certain place on the Soviet border, 5th: Today is the 76th day of the German-Soviet war. The battle for Leningrad has officially begun. This morning, the German army bombarded the city with artillery, dropping no less than several thousand shells. As of the time of writing, the fighting is still fierce. The city is now surrounded on three sides. General Voroshilov, the commander of the city's defenses, has ordered the city to be defended and prepared for street fighting. All officers and civilians are fully armed. German military expert General Loeb, who is searching for long-range fortresses, has now led his troops to participate in the attack on the city. Leningrad still has two railway lines connecting it to the outside world. The German army plans to cut them off. Fierce fighting has broken out between the two sides. General Voroshilov has mobilized a large number of mechanized troops to rush to reinforce the city.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London, 6th: Leningrad, Gomel, and Odessa are still the main battlefields on the eastern front. Although the Soviet communiqué still simply reports that there is fighting on the entire front, judging from the news from all sides, the battle of Gomel seems to be intensifying. According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the Soviet High Command is quite optimistic about the recent developments. If the Soviet army in Leningrad and its southeastern positions launch a joint offensive at the same time, the German army may be caught in a pincer movement. However, there is currently no sign that the Soviet army will take this strategic action. The Soviet army seems to be in an active position in the central war zone near Smolensk, while the German army is taking a defensive position. This morning, news from Finland also reported that the German army had approached the railway junction of Belinsk. (This place is located 60 miles east of Gomel.) However, Moscow telegraphs have denied this.</p>
<p>The War Zone is Extended by 2,000 Miles, and Fierce Battles are Being Waged for Three Cities</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London, 6th: Military commentators said that fighting continued yesterday in Leningrad and Odessa, two of the three western Soviet cities that the German army was trying to capture. There was no new news from the third city, Kiev, but news of a major new victory for the Soviet army came from the central war zone (Kiev is at the southern end of this zone). According to a supplementary communiqué issued yesterday, the Soviet army led by General Timoshenko defeated the German 263rd Infantry Division in the Pokhov area of the northern central zone. The division suffered 7,000 casualties in six days, and the remnants retreated in disarray. It is widely believed that Timoshenko's counter-offensive has forced the German army to concentrate again in the central zone, and the advance of the German army in this zone, which invaded south from Gomel, has slowed down. Leningrad now has a war council of six people to assist General Voroshilov in defending the city. Yesterday, the German command claimed that the German army was carrying out the encirclement of Leningrad, and the city was already under heavy German artillery fire. This statement has not been confirmed by Moscow. A Reuters correspondent stationed in Moscow called Leningrad to inquire and received a telegram saying that the German army was consolidating its positions in order to launch an offensive against the city, but it was constantly being counter-attacked by the Soviet army, and fierce bloodshed was taking place. The 2,000-mile-long forward line in southern Odessa is still being firmly defended. The Romanian army, which is helping Germany, has obviously suffered heavy blows. The local Soviet commander, Major General Volobiter, reported that two more infantry divisions had been sent to the front line to replace the three or four Romanian divisions that were destroyed at the end of August, and they had also been severely damaged. General Budenny, the commander-in-chief of the Soviet army in the southern war zone, is still leading his troops in a counter-offensive on both banks of the Dnieper River. The Soviet air force and naval aviation planes are also launching fierce attacks to relieve the pressure on Leningrad's Odessa. Although the air also [], Odessa is setting up absolute air superiority in Leningrad. No German radio station has mentioned the Soviet [].</p>
<p>Odessa Port with Deep Trenches and High Walls; Military and Civilians Prepare for a Decisive Battle</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Moscow, 6th: Odessa is now isolated from other parts of the Soviet Union except for the sea route. The residents of the area are now engaged in defensive work with extremely effective results. The leader is Klivenov, who won the title of Soviet Hero in the Soviet-Finnish War. He is teaching the residents to build fortresses, dig trenches, and tank traps. Although Odessa is not a city that normally manufactures military equipment, the city's factories have now been transformed to build tanks and armored vehicles, which are extremely effective for defense. In addition, mines are being manufactured on a large scale, with thousands of tons produced every day.</p>
<p>Cossack Soldiers are Unstoppable; Two German Battalions are Completely Annihilated</p>
<p>TASS dispatch from Moscow, 6th: The world-famous Cossack cavalry has been extremely active recently, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Under the leadership of Duvar, the cavalry unit recently broke into the enemy's rear, attacking the enemy and cutting off the enemy's communications, which was extremely successful. In the first engagement, the third battalion of the German 430th Infantry Regiment was wiped out. In addition to attacking enemy troops and cutting off communications, the Cossack cavalry also burned enemy warehouses. A few days ago, the Cossack cavalry annihilated a battalion of enemy infantry in a certain place. In short, the Cossack cavalry tactics are mysterious. Their sudden arrival and fully loaded departure have made the German soldiers helpless and unable to cope.</p>
<p>Vessels Concentrated and Waiting for Orders Along the Black Sea Coast of Bulgaria</p>
<h3>Meeting Between German Naval Chief and Boris; Prelude to New Joint Actions by the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Ankara, 6th: Local people believe that the meeting between German naval chief Admiral Raeder and Bulgarian King Boris is a prelude to new joint actions by Germany and Bulgaria against the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources believe that Germany and Bulgaria may attack the besieged Odessa or the Crimean Peninsula by land, sea, and air. The arrival of large German troops in Bulgaria and the concentration of ships in the Bulgarian ports of Varna and Burgas along the Black Sea can be used as evidence. If the German and Bulgarian forces land on the Black Sea and attack on land at the same time, they will threaten the Ukrainian army led by Soviet General Budenny. If the German army succeeds, it will further encroach on the Caucasus and the Baku oil fields. However, if Hitler wants to achieve his wish, he must first gain air superiority in Odessa and Crimea and defeat the Soviet Black Sea Fleet before he can. However, the strength of this fleet is far stronger than the naval forces that Germany and Bulgaria can mobilize. Furthermore, Odessa and Crimea have impregnable coastal defenses. The German side cannot land unless it destroys these defenses. Local people mostly believe that Hitler will launch attacks along these routes in an attempt to fight to the death in order to reach the oil-producing Caucasus before winter.</p>
<h3>Viborg After the War; Becomes a Field of Rubble; Cats and Dogs Compete for Food in the Streets; Not a Single Person in the City</h3>
<p>United Press dispatch from New York, 6th: United Press special correspondent Hansen has just arrived in Viborg. According to his report, the Soviet army behind the front line destroyed the city with fire and explosives after suffering 10,000 casualties. He also said that dogs, cats, and giant rats are fighting each other for food on the streets, and there is no one in the city.</p>
<h3>Turkey Begins Road Construction Program</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Ankara, 6th: Turkey has begun a large-scale road construction program. The new highway from Istanbul to Ankara will be completed by next winter. The program to build 6,200 miles of roads is now under consideration.</p>
<h3>Commendable Fighting Spirit of Red Army Soldiers; Only Know How to Obey Orders from Above; They Will Go Through Fire and Water Without Hesitation</h3>
<p>Havas Agency dispatch from the Swiss Capital, 5th: The "Journal de Genève" recently received a telegram from a Soviet war zone reporter, describing the quality of the Red Army in detail. It said that Red Army soldiers have a highly mechanized spirit, which is very different from ordinary soldiers. Their relationship with the Communist Party is not as deep as generally imagined. Although Red Army soldiers have a low level of education, they are easy to control. They only obey orders from above and will go through fire and water. In short, Red Army soldiers are like "robots", and their fighting power is extremely strong.</p>
<h3>Blood Will Never Be Shed in Vain; Light Will Eventually Come; London Commemorates Tagore; Soviet Ambassador Delivers Moving Speech</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London, 6th: The Indian 同志会 and the Civil Liberties Association jointly held a memorial meeting for the Indian poet and philosopher Tagore (who recently passed away in Calcutta) last night. Soviet Ambassador to the UK Maisky also attended the meeting and gave a speech, saying that darkness is now descending upon mankind. In this darkness, Tagore's bright image symbolizes the highest form of culture and the highest ideal of humanity, and reminds us that the darkness that exists today must end one day. I firmly believe that there will be a better time in the future. Hundreds of thousands or even millions of my compatriots are bravely fighting against Hitler's mechanized armies, shedding their blood to seek this better time, and the blood shed will never be in vain. Final victory will belong to us, and we can eventually build a better world. Writer Thompson (a friend of Tagore), the chairman of the memorial meeting, also delivered a speech to welcome the Soviet ambassador and his wife.</p>
<h3>Soviet-Greek Diplomatic Relations to Be Restored Soon</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Istanbul, 6th: Soviet-Greek diplomatic relations, which were suspended when Germany invaded the Balkans, are about to be restored. A delegation led by Pipinelis, former Greek minister to Bulgaria, will go to Moscow next week. He will remain as the minister to the Soviet Union and present his credentials to Stalin.</p>

<h3>Hull Officially Announces: No Progress in US-Japan Talks; Roosevelt Will Reply to Konoe's Letter, but Details of the Response Are Not Disclosed</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 6th – Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that a reply would soon be made to Prime Minister Konoe's letter to President Roosevelt. Hull made this statement during a reception for reporters, indicating that the current US-Japan talks were not necessarily linked to Konoe's letter. He stated that the exploratory talks conducted previously with Ambassador Nomura had begun before the arrival of Konoe's letter. Hull declined to specify the content of the US response to Konoe's letter. However, the fact that a reply has not yet been made indicates that US officials are still studying various issues and consider Konoe's letter to be important. It appears that general discussions with Japan are awaiting developments and will proceed after the reply to Konoe's letter is completed.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 6th – Secretary of State Hull today indicated for the first time that the US-Japan exploratory talks were not progressing smoothly. Hull believes that President Roosevelt will ultimately reply to Prime Minister Konoe's letter with a written response, but Hull declined to reveal the content of the response. Diplomatic circles here generally believe that the US-Japan talks have stalled due to the inability to find a common ground for negotiation. This view is reinforced by Hull's statement.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th – Washington has given no indication of the extent to which the exploratory US-Japan talks have progressed. However, under President Roosevelt's direction, the US continues to negotiate with Japan. It is widely believed that Japan is simply delaying matters, as Japan has not yet provided concrete proof of its willingness to sincerely follow the US's basic principles to resolve US-Japan issues. It is acknowledged here that the US policy of aiding China remains the main key to US-Japan relations. Officials reiterate that the US appeasement policy has ended, and Roosevelt will not sacrifice China to appease Japan. It is considered highly unlikely that Japan will immediately announce the abandonment of its expansionist policy or withdraw from the Axis. News from Tokyo indicates that the situation is becoming increasingly tense, with Japanese extremists demanding that the government break through the encirclement by force.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Tokyo, 5th – This agency's reporter has learned from reliable sources that the US-Japan talks have been progressing smoothly so far, under the personal direction of President Roosevelt, with Secretary of State Hull playing only a secondary role. Regarding the issues being discussed, well-informed sources here fear that disclosure would provoke opposition within Japan or interference from third countries, and therefore decline to provide details. However, it appears that Japan initially insisted on establishing only a temporary arrangement, aiming to temporarily restore trade between the two countries and limit it to financial transactions. But since President Roosevelt met with British Prime Minister Churchill somewhere at sea, these talks have stalled. The US government made it clear to Japan that it was no longer interested in the idea of establishing a temporary arrangement. However, if Japan is prepared to examine the underlying political issues that have separated the US and Japan since the "Marco Polo Bridge Incident," the US is willing to continue the talks. In other words, if both sides wish to resolve economic issues, they must first establish a preliminary agreement on the various political issues that affect US-Japan relations. At the time, it was widely rumored in Washington that the US government had instructed Ambassador Grew to present a very important proposal to the Japanese government. In any case, although the Japanese cabinet expressed its approval in principle to expand the scope of the discussions, it had to inform the German and Italian governments of its position at all times. On August 28th, Konoe sent another letter to President Roosevelt, further clarifying the US-Japan talks. It is said that the main points of the letter were twofold: (1) to assure the US government that if the two countries could reach an agreement, the Japanese cabinet would be able to obtain full support from all sectors of the country to implement the agreement; (2) that there were no issues that could not be resolved through negotiations. American sources here believe that if the current talks are successful, the results would not only resolve US-Japan issues, but also easily resolve Sino-Japanese issues and stabilize the entire Far East situation. Furthermore, the initial positions of both Japan and the US in the talks were extremely firm, which was probably a tactic to leave room for bargaining. In reality, both the US and Japanese governments intended to seek a compromise. In addition, regarding the proposal for Japan to withdraw from the Axis, it is said here that the US has never made this demand, and even if it were offered as the price of peace, no Japanese cabinet could accept it. Therefore, this issue has not even been discussed.</p>
<h3>Canada: War Materials Will Be Supplied to China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th – Canadian Minister of Supply Howe announced yesterday in Ottawa that Canada is not only prepared to supply Britain with munitions, but will also supply war materials to China and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Malaya Present Flags to British Troops</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 6th – Today, a delegation of overseas Chinese held a flag presentation ceremony at the residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in Malaya, as part of the "Aid Britain Week" program. At that time, representatives of the overseas Chinese presented two silk banners embroidered with the letter "V" to Lieutenant General Percival, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in Malaya, and Air Vice-Marshal Pulford, Commander of the Far East Air Force. They stated that the flag presentation was to express the determination of the overseas Chinese in Malaya to support the common cause for which China and Britain are currently fighting, and as a symbol of final victory. Percival expressed his thanks upon receiving the flags, stating that the troops stationed in Malaya were truly representative of all free countries, and that he was proud that his troops included units composed of overseas Chinese from Malaya. Pulford also expressed his thanks, suggesting that the banners be presented to the Air Ministry and recommended for display in the Imperial War Museum.</p>
<h3>Japan's Stockpiles of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th – The Economic Journal yesterday published an article on Japan's stockpiles of military supplies, stating that both the Japanese Navy and Army have large stocks of munitions, ammunition, equipment, raw materials, and fuel in Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and the occupied areas of China, including iron sand, scrap iron, scrap steel, coal, kerosene, gasoline, machine oil, rubber, by-products, rice, cloth, and leather. According to reliable observers, these supplies would allow Japan to cope with a year-long commercial blockade by Britain and the US while continuing the war against China, and would support southward operations for about six months.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Elected as a Symbol of Democratic Politics</h3>
<p>United Press International, Hollywood, 6th – Madame Chiang Kai-shek has been selected by the famous artist Flagg as one of the four major virtues of democratic politics. Flagg selected four women from seven hundred photographs of women, and believes that each of these four women symbolizes a virtue of democratic politics. He considers Madame Chiang Kai-shek to be a symbol of "humanity," the Duchess of Kent a symbol of "hope," Hollywood actress Loretta Young a symbol of "happiness," and the wife of the Brazilian president Vargas a symbol of "honor."</p>
<h3>US Attorney General Replaced</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 6th – The Senate yesterday approved the appointment of Biddle as the US Attorney General. Biddle succeeds Jackson, who has been appointed as a judge of the US Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>US Cracks Nazi Spy Ring: 33 Men and Women Arrested; Methods of Transmitting Information Revealed</h3>
<p>United Press International, New York, 6th – Today, thirty-three people, including three women, were put on trial for violating the Espionage Act. The suspects are all engaged in various everyday occupations, including an inspector at the Norden plant, which manufactures the famous Norden bombsight. Only one of the suspects, a 63-year-old named Dugen, is solely engaged in espionage. He has been engaged in espionage since the Boer War. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents have risked danger for two years to track the activities of these spies. Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Hoover declared that this arrest is the largest in US history. According to testimony during the preliminary hearing, the spy ring was very well disguised. With the exception of five, all the spies are US citizens, but most are of German origin. They followed the instructions of their superiors to obtain positions in ordinary industries and to establish a solid position in their communities. They were ordered to avoid Nazi or pro-German gatherings or demonstrations. Their activities were very secret, and even their closest family members were not informed. Their method of transmitting information to Germany was quite simple. They bribed crew members of various ships to transmit messages for them, using daily code words as signs. As for receiving messages, German personnel would often contact the couriers at major ports where traffic had not been interrupted, such as Lisbon and Genoa, according to prior arrangements. As for the spies' compensation, funds would be remitted from banks in Mexico, South America, and the Netherlands to banks in New York, and then transferred to the spies' accounts, or couriers would bring US dollars to the US and hand them over to local personnel. The communication method they often used was to photograph documents into small photos and have the couriers carry them.</p>
<p>United Press International, New York, 6th – A woman named Meyer, 24 years old, was arrested yesterday on suspicion of being pro-German.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Puppet Regime Pledges Allegiance to Germany; Warning Issued to Opposition; Terror Will Be Met with Terror</h3>
<p>United Press International, Norwegian Capital, 6th – Quisling, the head of the Nazi-ruled Norwegian government, warned opponents yesterday that terror would be met with terror, and that he felt he had the full power to do so. Speaking in Oslo, Quisling said that the Quisling Party must fight its own people, which was terrible, but also unavoidable. He also stated that of the 17 million people in the North, 11 million have been placed within the "New Order."

<h3>Soviet Troops Entering Iran Reach the City of Beklevi; Nazi Secret Agents Flee in Panic; Iranian Prime Minister Suddenly Suffers a Heart Attack</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 6th – A correspondent from the Soviet side of the Red Army in Iran reports that when German secret agents in the Iranian city of Beklevi heard that Soviet troops were arriving, they fled in panic, leaving behind important documents, movie cameras, steel helmets, Nazi badges, and even Nazi party membership cards. The report described the scene on the road to Beklevi as follows: "We occasionally glimpse the white walls of luxurious villas in the forests, behind which are the mud huts inhabited by Iranians. These villas are the summer residences of German secret agents, who live comfortably in Iran, claiming to be engineers, technicians, architects, and businessmen, but in reality, they are all engaged in espionage. The bridges and roads used by the Soviet troops to reach Beklevi were built by German foremen. These roads lead directly to the Soviet border, with the aim of enabling the German army to advance rapidly into the Soviet Union. Shortly after the Soviet troops entered Beklevi, the situation began to recover. Stores opened, the police returned to their posts, and the Iranian troops and residents of the city welcomed the Soviet troops."</p>

The rumors spread by the Germans that Foroughi had resigned because the Anglo-Soviet proposals were unacceptable to him, and that he was suffering from a "diplomatic illness," are unfounded.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Miscellaneous Yarns are Still Rising; Why Should Double Horse Not Strive for Improvement?</h3>
<p>After hovering for two days, the yarn market rebounded again yesterday. This is because the price of Japanese yarn and cloth is rising daily, which in turn affects cotton yarn. Although the demand from Hong Kong traders is not strong, the trend for miscellaneous brands of yarn is unusually firm. General shortsellers, aware of the overall environment, have to grit their teeth and cover their positions, so the market shows signs of recovery again. However, large shortsellers remain unmoved, so the rise in Double Horse factory orders is still slow. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was $1,730, and the low price was $1,713. In the afternoon, due to the end of the week, there was usually no market. The price of yarn on the exchange rose by seven, eight, or even ten dollars, and cloth rose by five or six cents. Currently, the yarn market is still hovering at high levels. If actual sales develop, there may be upside potential. Today, 1,160 bales of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened strongly in the morning. Many expected the price to be low and wanted to buy, so the opening price was $1,713, a slight increase of $2. Everyone on the floor called to buy, and speculators followed suit, pushing the price up to $1,723 or $1,724. Then, news came that the exchange opened with further gains, and sentiment rose again. In the second session, there was a pullback, with some profit-takers selling. At the same time, transactions from Guang merchants were not active, and the price eased to $1,718. However, when the exchange closed, the market recovered again, sentiment was revived, and shortsellers covered their positions. The market gradually advanced to a high of $1,730 at the close. The half-day turnover was $7,595. The amount bought by each trade group is listed below:</p>
<p>The Golden Transformation Horse futures market continued the firm momentum of the previous day's close, suddenly trending upward. This was because of rumors that the US-Japan situation had eased and that foreign cotton had shown a firm rise. Sentiment was excited for a time, and there was a rush to buy. In addition, factory orders and the exchange both rose, further prompting latent big players to cover their positions, and speculative covering was especially prominent. As a result, the floor tightened, and near and far terms were almost at high prices. The opening price for the September contract was $1,629, a jump of $9; the October contract was $1,653.50, also up $6.50; and the November contract was $1,670, a sudden jump of $5. Afterwards, although there was a slight pullback due to the selling of many shorts, the selling power was not as strong as the buying intention of the many longs, so the decline was very slight, with the difference between high and low only varying between four and eight dollars. Therefore, although the result was a rise, it could not be considered a very solid footing. The noon close for the near-term was $1,628, up $8; the October contract closed at $1,653.50, up $9; and the November contract was $1,674, also up by as much as $9. Turnover in the morning session was 11,000 bales. As of the 5th, the three-month outstanding account quantity was 22,560 bales, including 6,920 bales for the September contract, 8,390 bales for the October contract, and 7,250 bales for the November contract. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the half-day morning session are recorded below (net board price):</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton is Like Icing on the Cake: Foreign Cotton Companies are Also Competing to Sell</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade has enthusiastic sentiment and active market conditions. In recent days, as foreign cotton companies have also been competing with each other, they have been constantly setting the lowest selling prices. At the same time, the arrival dates in Shanghai are very close, all being the "Mirelun" directly bound for Shanghai, with a journey of no more than forty days. All these factors are making it popular with the masses. Therefore, regardless of the factory or traders, they seem to have been working hard to negotiate, intending to hold as much as possible, carefully selecting and purchasing raw fine velvet materials at good prices for future sales competition after arrival in Shanghai. This is the reason why foreign cotton order transactions have reached their peak in recent days. Yesterday, the total amount of Brazilian cotton traded still exceeded 1,000 bales.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first fell due to hedging by Southern traders, but then rose again due to buying by traders and covering by shorts. As a result, the closing price was six or seven points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The US cotton statistics from August 1st to September 5th of this year are recorded below (per bale of 500 pounds):</p>
<p>Cumulative Arrivals: 670,000 bales</p>
<p>Cumulative Mill Consumption: 864,000 bales</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports: 53,000 bales</p>
<p>Stocks in All Ports: 526,000 bales</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was still closed yesterday due to a bank holiday. The market is expected to open higher today by two rupees compared to yesterday.</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation is still calm, but transactions have decreased. This is because factories are closed on weekends, which halts business opportunities. However, traders with high aspirations are still not giving up. The market is therefore in a dormant state, with nothing to report. American Benghazi 505 No. 100 bales, stacking and handover in 35.5, Lan Gonghua, India, 100 bales, again, again, 314.5, 100 bales, again, Fire Machine Grass Bag, 285 again, 340 bales, again.</p>
<h3>Securities: The Bulls Have Strong Power; Domestic Bonds Cannot Fall</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter government bond market only traded one session yesterday due to Saturday. The market opened at 11:00 AM, and the market was extremely firm under selling pressure from the masses, only fluctuating between two and three cents. In the end, the bulls still dominated, with more rises than falls. Yuancheng continued to buy, reportedly driven by Sichuan traders. Some in the market are still pessimistic, but they are surrounded by powerful players. If the market breaks through one dollar, there will inevitably be a scramble to cover, making the outlook difficult to bearish. At the opening, Zhongfu and Yuancheng bought amidst widespread selling. The opening price for Class C bonds was $70.08, rising to $70.09, but as selling pressure increased, Yitai, Xiedian, Yuanda, Tongsheng, Dalian, Hefeng, and Defu all sold off, briefly dropping to $70.06. Dazhong then bought in large quantities, and Shuntai, Runli, Xinchang, and Xisheng all absorbed the selling. Although Gongmao, Tongkang, Hefeng, Yizhong, Runde, Jiufu, and Delong also sold, the market rose from $70.06 back to $70.08 at the close, showing the strong power of the bulls. In total, the market price resulted in Class C bonds unchanged, Class A and B bonds slightly down by five cents, and Class D and E bonds up by three cents. The turnover was over one million two hundred thousand dollars. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, forty shares of Wuzhou Pharmacy were traded at a price of $202.50 per share.</p>
<p>London, 9th (Friday): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and stocks of various British companies remained flat. Only the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation London-registered shares continued to weaken by half a pound, with a price of 78 pounds. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Merchants Fear a Surge in Arrivals; They Try Their Best to Sell Back; Small Grade Rice Once Entered the 100-Dollar Mark; Thick and Thin Rice Followed the Downstream Sharp Drop of Five or Six Dollars</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice rose and fell sharply, with prices fluctuating wildly. The price fluctuations, although substantial, were actually caused by wavering sentiment. In the morning, continuing the previous day's downward trend, selling pressure was extremely strong. Holders of goods feared that the arrival of new Wuxian, Xinjians, and foreign rice would affect their stockpiles, so they were still secretly trying their best to sell back. However, actual sales on the local streets were weak, and there were no inquiries about new rice from inland areas. Therefore, in the early market, small grade rice fell to break the 100-dollar mark to $99.50. It was said that the price of small grade rice in foreign warehouses was only $98. Other rice prices followed downstream, falling sharply by three to five dollars compared to the previous day. Then, as big players could not bear to sell, and many shorts and customers saw the opportunity when small grade rice broke through the 100-dollar mark, they absorbed it in large quantities. As a result, buying sentiment suddenly surged, and the situation reversed from fatigue to tightness, causing a huge sensation, and shouts began to rise. The price of small grade rice first rebounded, and other goods also followed suit, trending upward. Daxing had previously sold 1,000 tons to Ningbo merchants, and yesterday also absorbed spot rice and Yinghua's goods in the market. As buying sentiment gradually thickened, and rumors appeared to be bullish, the market climbed step by step. Small grades rose again to $106, and in the afternoon, there was a price of $106.80. At the close, small grade rice in bank warehouses returned to $106, $105 in foreign warehouses, and $104.50. Number One Saigon was $121, Number Two Siam was $103, Mindang inferior was $110, Broken Tips were $81.50, $80, Yinghua's small grade rice was $126, Number One Siam was $124. The after-market was also strong and refused to sell cheaply again. Total daily turnover was more than 20,000 bags of spot rice, and more than 1,000 tons of Yinghua's goods. Overall, the city rose and fell, comparable to the previous market.</p>
<p>Foreign rice arrivals in Shanghai are quite strong. The Taikoo Company's Guiyang vessel arrived yesterday morning, carrying 500 bags of foreign rice from Huanluo and 4,346 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. In addition, the Jardine Matheson Yüsheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 4,242 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the Weisford Wharf for unloading. A total of 9,088 bags of foreign rice arrived yesterday. It is reported that the Taikoo Company's Poyang vessel will arrive today, carrying a large batch of foreign rice. Yesterday, the thin and glutenous domestic rice market experienced a sharp decline, which was actually due to the previous sharp drop in foreign rice, resulting in a large price difference, making it difficult for shop sales to cope. They all retreated, so sellers had no choice but to follow the devaluation to seek a corresponding price. As a result, Nangang early rice fell sharply by five or six dollars, opening at only $149 or $147, Wuxi special glutenous rice was $148, and Pudong new glutenous rice was $150.</p>
<p>The sales of glutinous rice are stagnant, and the selling price is still difficult to maintain, falling by one or two dollars. Opening prices are: Hong Kong special yuan $124, general market $122, $120, medium grade inferior $117, glutinous green high-quality goods $111, $110.</p>
<h3>Limited Changes in the Foreign Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign flour market in the city turned stable. Although there were some fluctuations, the changes were minimal, only fluctuating between thirty and fifty cents. This is because the supply of wheat flour is sufficient and there is no fear of shortages, making it difficult for prices to rise excessively. However, local flour and newly ordered flour are scarce. Local customers are occasionally buying small amounts, which is enough to support the market's stability. In this situation where it is difficult for prices to rise or fall significantly, they are only affected by the environment and fluctuate accordingly. In the morning, the price was lowered by thirty to forty cents due to the drop in the price of foreign rice, but it was pulled up again in the afternoon by foreign rice. As a result, most prices were similar to the previous close, with only a few showing a slight increase. The Paotai flour was as low as 31.85 yuan in the morning market, and closed at 31.34 yuan in the afternoon. The Jinlong West Mill was as low as 30.04 yuan and as high as 30.08 yuan in the market. Dong Mill was 31.23 yuan, Xiangjiao Mill was 31.60 yuan, and Zhonglou Mill was 34 yuan. 20,000 bags were traded. Local flour was stable but without goods. Wheat prices remained at the original level.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Oil Prices Squeezed Down by Four Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil futures decreased sharply. This was because the overall situation was difficult to predict, and most speculators were cautious. Both the bulls and bears adopted a wait-and-see attitude, with only small retail investors making occasional transactions. Therefore, the market fluctuated, generally falling first and then rebounding, resulting in a decrease of three to four yuan compared to the previous day. It is estimated that about 4,000 dan of Qing oil from the Dayou Factory was sold for September delivery. The opening price was 181.50 yuan, the lowest was 177.50 yuan, and the closing price was 179 yuan. In addition, about 2,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from the Rihua Factory opened at 188 yuan, the lowest was 183 yuan, and the closing price was 184.50 yuan. There were sporadic transactions of Qingdao raw oil, and the price remained at the original level.</p>
<p>Today, 300 bags of soybeans and 100 bags of peanuts were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Black Market Exchange Rate Gradually Decreasing; Activity Level</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC listed price and the small counter prices of British and American businesses remained unchanged. The black market exchange rate for British and American currencies was even more stable, with only $5,000 traded. This was from exporters selling or speculators emerging, so the price did not change slightly and was the same as the previous night's close. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Exporters Sell Slightly</p>
<p>Since the morning, there was no change in the silver market in the foreign news from the UK, US, and India. There were also no changes in the exchange rates of various countries. The central bank's listed prices for various currencies were stable. The opening price for banks' selling prices in the domestic market was 2 pence 859375 for spot British pounds and 4.84375 yuan for US dollars. The silver equalization tax remained at 24.50. Export companies sold US dollars to foreign banks at 4.875 yuan, but there were few transactions afterward.

<p>Tianjin: US Dollar Eases, British Pound Stable</p>
<p>Tianjin, 6th (Saturday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London telegraphic transfer remained unchanged at 3 pence 25. The New York telegraphic transfer eased by 0.0625 to 5.50 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 2.5 cents to 87 yuan. The "Joint Note" dark market was slightly down by 0.5 cents to 52.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market: A Scene of Desolation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market futures were also stable, at around 6,880 yuan, with a high and low difference of only seven yuan. This was the smallest fluctuation in a day for futures trading. This is because the Hong Kong equalization meeting is expected to release news about the city's black market exchange rate in the middle of next week. With less fluctuation in foreign exchange, people are more confident. Only 600 to 700 taels were traded in half a day, and the price ended up the same as the previous day's close. Cash "a certain bank" stopped buying, and the price continued to fall in sparse trading. Initially, it was 9,060 yuan. Lianxing sold ten taels at 9,050 yuan, and Yongfeng sold ten taels at 9,040 yuan, all of which were bought by Chengda, a decrease of 30 yuan. The price of jewelry gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Futures Silent</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 9:15 am, and immediately fell by five yuan under selling pressure to 6,875 yuan. Tongkangyong and Xiangxingyong successively absorbed it, rising to 6,882 yuan, which was sold by Yuxingyong, and remained stable at the 6,880 yuan mark. At around 11:00, Xianghe sold it out, and it fell again to 6,875 yuan, which was absorbed by Yifeng. The noon closing price was 6,880 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price. Calculated at the black market US dollar settlement price, it was 6,858.9 yuan, an increase of 21.2 yuan. The difference in half a day was seven yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The price of gold sold by gold shops in this city was 9,100 yuan, and the purchase price was reduced by 200 yuan. There was no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remains Stable</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops remains at 930 yuan, with a reduction of 50 yuan for purchases.</p>

<h3>Silver Union Changes Check Exchange System</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Joint Reserve Committee has established changes to the check exchange system, which will be implemented from September 15th, and has already notified the banks. In addition to uniformly changing the name to "special" correspondent banks, all special correspondent banks must sort out the payment checks of other special correspondent banks received each day and send them to the committee for collection in batches using deposit debit memos. After the committee receives the collection checks, it will check the number of checks and calculate the amount. If there are no errors, it will issue a deposit credit memo and debit the account of the collecting bank. At the same time, it will sort out the checks separately, prepare a notice of presentment of checks, and send them together with the original checks to the paying banks as soon as possible. After the paying banks check the number of checks without error, they should keep the notice and sign and stamp the payment application with the bank's withdrawal seal opened at the committee, and return it to the committee, which will use it to debit the account of the paying bank. The aforementioned payment application is the receipt for receiving the presentment of checks, which is prepared by the committee on its behalf and sent together with the notice of presentment of checks to each paying bank. Each time the paying banks receive the checks presented by the committee, they should quickly verify the seals and make arrangements for payment. If there are checks that should be dishonored, they should be returned to the committee for debiting within the time specified by the committee using a deposit debit memo. The committee will then prepare a dishonored check notice and return it together with the original check to the original collecting bank. However, if the reason for the dishonored check is that the procedures of the original collecting bank have not been completed, and the payment can be made after the procedures are corrected, it should be handled directly with the original collecting bank without returning it to the committee. After the original collecting bank receives the check returned by the committee, it should sign and stamp the payment application in accordance with the regulations on recording and collecting checks and return it to the committee for payment. If the amount stated in the notice of presentment of checks or the dishonored check notice is greater than the actual amount of the check, the committee should debit the difference to the account of the paying bank and issue a deposit credit memo to make up for it. If it is less than the actual amount of the check, the paying bank should issue a transfer application, etc., to be paid by the committee. The party that discovers it first has the obligation to notify the other party quickly. If the deposit balance of the correspondent account of each bank is insufficient to pay the amount of checks payable by the bank on that day, it should be replenished before 5:00 pm that afternoon. For those collected by foreign banks, the deposit balance of the correspondent account of the previous day shall be the limit. The time for sending and returning checks, transferring accounts, and replenishing funds for all banks is set as follows: time for sending checks is before 2:30 pm on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and before 12:00 noon on Saturdays; time for returning checks is before 6:00 pm on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and before 3:00 pm on Saturdays; time for transferring accounts is before 5:00 pm on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and before 2:30 pm on Saturdays; time for replenishing the balance of correspondent accounts is before 5:00 pm on weekdays (Monday to Friday) and before 2:30 pm on Saturdays.</p>

<h3>Exchange Settlement Measures Have Been Promulgated; Foreign Banks Implemented Them Yesterday; The Procedures for Applying for Exchange are Extremely Strict; Each Designated Bank Bears Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>The Equalization Committee's Benchmark Changes with Market Needs</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, in order to maintain legitimate import trade of necessities, stipulated on the 18th of last month that foreign exchange would be supplied at the price of 5.34375 yuan per US dollar and 3 pence 1875 per British pound, the general legitimate commercial firms have expressed their support, and black market speculation has been curtailed. At the same time, Mr. Taylor, the American assistant of the Equalization Committee stationed in Shanghai, and the relevant banks have discussed and resolved the specific details of managing the Shanghai exchange market. At the end of last month, the Equalization Committee decided to convene an important meeting in Hong Kong. Mr. Taylor and Mr. Hawkins, the chief of the Mercantile Bank, and Mr. McKay, the chief of the Citibank, were all summoned to Hong Kong one after another, while Mr. Holbrook, the British commissioner of the Equalization Committee, came and went in a hurry. It is obvious that the Equalization Committee will have a comprehensive consideration and decision on the long-unresolved foreign exchange problem in Shanghai. According to the news obtained by the reporter of the New Life News Agency from the banking circles of the Allied countries, the meeting of the Equalization Committee has yielded results. The order regarding the exchange settlement measures for the import of necessities to manage the exchange market has arrived in Shanghai, and the Allied banks have complied with it since yesterday and have notified the various business lines. As for the Chinese national banks, the order needs to be forwarded by the General Bank, which takes some time, but it will be able to start soon. The measures stipulated in this decision are extremely meticulous, and the application for foreign exchange is strictly restricted, which proves the authorities' determination to maintain trade and prevent speculation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Designated Banks Responsible for Handling</p>
<p>According to the general notice of the American freezing decree, only banks holding a special permission note from the American government are allowed to operate foreign exchange business. Although there are 14 Allied banks allowed to operate foreign exchange business, only HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, Chartered Bank, and Chase Bank are important. Among the Chinese four banks, although they all have this special permission note, the processing is concentrated in the hands of the China and Communications Banks. Chinese commercial banks only need to entrust the national banks to apply, and they can also operate. The management method of the exchange market formulated by the Equalization Committee this time is to be handled centrally by the designated banks. These banks are actually the intermediate agencies between the import commercial lines and the Equalization Fund. They apply to the Equalization Committee for foreign exchange at the request of customers and receive a commission of 0.3125 (the same for British and American exchange). Therefore, although the specified price is 5.34375 yuan per US dollar and 3 pence 1875 per British pound, after deducting the commission, the actual price is 5.3125 yuan per US dollar and 3 pence 15625 per British pound (this is the HSBC listed price). If the importer has goods to import, he can apply to any designated bank for foreign exchange settlement. After the original handling bank applies to the Equalization Committee for approval, he can pay the foreign exchange according to the HSBC listed price. Therefore, in fact, the importer has no relationship with the Equalization Authority. In the eyes of the Equalization Committee, the only responsible party is the bank.</p>
<p>Application for Exchange Settlement Requires Guarantee</p>
<p>After the bank requests foreign exchange supply from the import commercial line, it must apply to the Equalization Committee for exchange settlement. The application method can be either by telegram or by letter due to the distance between Shanghai and Hong Kong. For the sake of speed, the use of telegraphic applications is preferred. As for the application procedures, first, the original handler must fill out an application form to request foreign exchange from the Chinese Equalization Fund Committee. This form must be filled out in five copies. The last copy must be signed and sealed by the applying bank. The application form includes (1) the name and address of the bank, (2) the name and address of the importer, (3) the total amount of foreign exchange to be sold, (4) the date and type of foreign exchange to be sold (including the name and address of the payee), (5) an investigation of imported goods, divided into A. tariff number, B. detailed category, C. value (US dollars or British pounds), D. country of origin or manufacture, E. country of import, and F. date of arrival, (6) port of entry, (7) where the goods will be transferred to in China after import (please specify this item if you know in advance), (8) distribution in China (such as consumption location, use, name and address, buyer or consignee, etc.), (9) remarks. The last item, item 10, has the nature of a guarantee, which reads, "Our bank, to the best of our knowledge and belief, proves that the above items are completely correct, and that the imported goods described herein are in accordance with the conditions agreed upon in our bank's application form of a certain date and number. If the Equalization Fund finds that the imported goods described herein are not in accordance with those described in the application form, then our bank is willing to sell all the foreign exchange obtained from the Equalization Committee for the supply of imported goods back to the Equalization Committee at the exchange rate at the time of purchase. Our bank is willing to provide the Equalization Fund with such written evidence as it currently deems necessary to ensure that what is stated here is correct (bank signature and seal)."</p>
<p>Already Settled Foreign Exchange Can Be Recovered</p>
<p>The aforementioned item 10, regarding the guarantee provided by the bank, shows that the bank bears a great responsibility for the exchange approved by the Equalization Committee. Before the bank sends the application form to the Equalization Committee, it can first apply by telegram. After receiving the telegram application, the Equalization Fund can immediately approve it. However, if the application form is formally received later and it is found that the originally applied imported goods are obviously not in compliance with the conditions, the previous approval can still be revoked, and the bank can be ordered to recover the foreign exchange originally approved by the bank from the importer. If it cannot be recovered, the bank has no choice but to replenish the foreign exchange previously supplied in the open market (i.e., the black market) and "sell it back" to the Equalization Committee. The loss of the difference between the black market exchange rate and the Equalization Committee's exchange rate must be borne by the original handling bank. This strict method requires the bank to be cautious when applying to the Equalization Committee for exchange settlement for the importer, otherwise it may encounter unwarranted losses. According to what is stated here, the black market refers to the market where non-essential import commercial lines scrape foreign exchange, export commercial lines throw foreign exchange, speculators are active, and banks with their own backing supply foreign exchange. Because foreign exchange for the import of necessities is supplied by the Equalization Fund at a longer price, there is no reason to take it from the black market. However, if the bank is required by the Equalization Committee to recover the previously approved foreign exchange but cannot recover it from the importer, it can only replenish it in the black market and return it to the Equalization Fund. From this, it can be seen that the black market may not disappear temporarily, but its adverse impact can be gradually reduced because its scope of activity is obviously reduced due to the fact that necessities can apply for exchange settlement with the Equalization Committee.</p>
<p>The Audit Standard is Based on Market Conditions</p>
<p>The standards for reviewing exchange settlement are entirely determined by the Equalization Fund based on the actual situation. According to foreign bank sources, the Equalization Committee has recently approved several batches of exchange settlements for rice, wheat, and flour. Among them, there were two batches of flour, but the Equalization Committee rejected the third batch of flour's application for foreign exchange settlement. According to the regulations on the import of goods approved by the Executive Yuan, flour was originally one of them, but the Equalization Committee actually did not approve it. Its intention is that the Equalization Fund believes that the supply of flour on the market is already more than adequate, and there is no need to continue importing it for the time being. Therefore, this measure actually contains the intention of regulating market supply and exhausting efforts to reduce loopholes. The same will be done for rice and wheat. For the item of coal, because the country of origin is mostly French territory, which does not belong to the British pound or US dollar group, there are many considerations for exchange settlement. In short, the audit standards adopted by the Equalization Fund have no fixed rule to follow (of course, the two regulations of the Ministry of Finance and the Executive Yuan prohibiting and allowing imports are the more important basis). The power of decision is entirely in the hands of the Equalization Committee. Approval or rejection must be based on actual needs, market supply, and other important factors. However, no matter what standards the Equalization Committee adopts, it is difficult for general speculators and importers of non-essential goods to seek even a little bit of foreign exchange from the Equalization Committee at favorable prices, because the purpose of the Equalization Committee's supply of foreign exchange is to maintain legitimate trade and prevent speculation.</p>
<p>China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks Await Orders to Comply</p>
<p>The China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks have not yet received the same orders for managing the exchange market as those received by foreign banks. Therefore, it will take longer for the order to be forwarded by the General Bank. Once received, they will also cooperate with other Allied banks to ensure its success. As for other Chinese commercial banks, such as Xingye, Kenye, Shanghai, Zhongnan, Dalu, Lin, Ye, Jincheng, Overseas Chinese, Guohua, Dongya, and Zhongxing, they have no right to operate foreign exchange. The unfinished foreign exchange business that was previously outstanding was all settled on the 15th of last month and collected and settled by the Central Bank on their behalf. In the future, if these banks need to operate the foreign exchange supply business for the import of necessities, they can transfer it to the China and Communications Banks to apply to the Equalization Committee on their behalf. The commission that the China and Communications Banks should receive will be entirely for the original handling Chinese commercial bank.</p>
<p>Fox Talks About the Future of the Black Market</p>
<p>United Press, Manila, 6th: Mr. Fox, the U.S. Treasury Department representative of the Chinese Equalization Fund Committee, indicated today that the Shanghai black market is becoming increasingly desperate. Mr. Fox and Mr. Artler, the representative of the Frozen Funds Management, left here this morning for Hong Kong. When meeting with the reporters of the United Press, Mr. Fox stated that he was very satisfied with the results of his efforts to support the value of legal tender, and said that the Shanghai black market would be even more difficult to maintain. Mr. Fox declined to comment on the rumors in the local financial community that several banks would have their ordinary licenses revoked under the freeze order unless they stopped certain ingenious transactions related to the freezing of funds.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Mawei to Resume Telegraphs Next Week</h3>
<p>The Fuzhou Mawei and other key points were recaptured one after another on September 3rd. Yesterday morning, according to people from the Great Eastern and Great Northern Telegraph Bureau, the telegraph bureaus in Fuzhou Mawei and other places still need to be reorganized internally, and it is expected that telegraphs can be restored within next week. As for the telegraph rates, the international submarine telegraph rates from Shanghai will be slightly changed from this month, increasing by 30% of the original price. There will be no major changes for telegraphs to domestic, Hong Kong, and Macau areas.</p>
<h3>Illegal Securities Trading</h3>
<p>New Life News Agency reports that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has received reports that a certain company in Shanghai is engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for customers, with large transactions that affect the financial situation of Shanghai. After investigating, it was found that the company had not been approved for registration and that its organization was similar to that of an exchange, which was obviously illegal. The Ministry has instructed the person in charge of the company to dissuade him from his illegal business and has notified the relevant industries to order their members not to engage in business activities with the illegal organization in order to prevent abuses. In addition, the Ministry will conduct inspections of similar organizations and transactions at any time in order to stop them.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Shanghai Electric Power Company Plans to Reduce Electricity Consumption by Another 10%; This Will Increase from 30% to 40%; Application Procedures are Being Handled with the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, the Shanghai Electric Power Company decided to reduce electricity consumption by 30% across the board for consumers with more than 1,000 degrees of electricity, except for public security agencies, hospitals, ice-making, refrigeration, and other businesses, due to the reduced source of coal. Recently, due to the turbulence in the new international situation, it is planned to expand the reduction by another 10%. If this plan is implemented, the working hours of various factories, except for Japanese-owned textile mills, will inevitably be shortened uniformly. It is now heard that the power company is applying to the Public Works Department, and it seems that the decision to increase the power cut from 30% to 40% has been made.</p>
<h3>Shanghai American Naval Retirees Affected by the Freeze Order; Washington Stops Issuing Pension Checks; Most are Chinese and Have Problems with Living</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was learned that the payment of pensions to retired American naval personnel residing in this port and other places has been affected by the American freeze order. Those who rely on this pension for a living are mostly large families with many mouths to feed. At the same time, most of the pension recipients are Chinese cooks and waiters who served on American gunboats, and their average monthly payment is 40 US dollars. The older ones served in the American Navy during the Spanish-American War and were under the command of Admiral Dewey. At that time, the American fleet fought in Manila Bay. These retired naval personnel, combined with American residents and American widows in China, total 85 people. The checks they received were issued by the American naval procurement office here, but since June, they have no longer been issued. These people sent telegrams to Washington requesting, and then received a reply saying that due to the implementation of the freeze order, all checks that should be issued to retired naval personnel and fleet reservists have been stopped from being issued. However, American citizens can still issue checks when they need living expenses or travel back to their country. At the same time, the telegram from Washington also stated that everyone must report to the State Department. It is heard that retired American naval personnel in this port are preparing to jointly petition the relevant parties for relief.</p>
<h3>French Concession Public Works Department Cancels Rice Price Limit</h3>
<p>The French Concession Public Works Department stated that the rice price, which was set on July 29, 1941 due to speculative manipulation, is now being cancelled from today because the market is normal.</p>
<h3>Large Amount of Fractional Currency Notes to be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to a report by the Dagong News Agency reporter, the British HSBC Bank has recently received 1 million yuan of red fractional currency notes from Hong Kong, which will be shipped to Shanghai next week. Once the inspection is completed, they can be exchanged by various industries and circulated in the city in late this month. Therefore, there will be no shortage of the use of subsidiary currency in this city.</p>
<h3>One Soviet Ship Returns Home; One Anchors at Manila; Remaining Ships Awaiting Repair to be Quietly Exported</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports: There are rumors that several Soviet ships that came to Shanghai from Vladivostok for repairs are about to set sail for Manila and Thailand to load supplies to support the Soviet government. However, an official from Hongyun Shipping Bureau, which manages these Soviet ships in Shanghai, denies this. He claims that when the U.S. government lifted the embargo on the Soviet Union, seven or eight Soviet ships arrived here from Vladivostok solely for repairs because dockyards in other ports were extremely crowded. Regarding the establishment of a supply line between Vladivostok and the Far East, the official stated that only the ship "Volkhov" diverted to Manila during its return voyage to the Soviet Union, and the cargo it loaded in Shanghai and the Philippines was of a general nature. Currently, only three Soviet ships remain docked in Shanghai: "Soviet Kovda" and "Food Industry". The remaining ships had previously sailed directly back to Vladivostok, carrying only small quantities of ordinary goods. The three Soviet ships currently in port are still in dry dock. The freighter "Soviet" is expected to be exported within a week, sailing directly back to the Soviet Union. The future movements of the other two ships are yet to be determined. Furthermore, it has been learned that the Soviet ship "Maytop" was previously ordered to be repaired at Tai Kok Tsui in Hong Kong. Since the sudden outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the ship has been undergoing accelerated modifications and quietly left Hong Kong for another destination last month.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Appointment of Consulting Committee Members Internally Decided</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Municipal Council recently decided to collect a special property tax. It is now learned that the Municipal Council has finalized the number of members for the Consulting Committee and the selection of candidates. The number of members will reach around twenty. The committee members from various countries have also been internally decided. In addition to Chinese, British, American, and Japanese nationals, there will also be one member each from Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Norway. However, France, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union have not yet been included. The Municipal Council is currently seeking the consent of the proposed committee members.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson and Swire Increase Ship Ticket Prices; Steerage Ticket Prices Increase Tenfold</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the prices of both north and south ocean ship tickets for British firms Jardine Matheson and Swire have repeatedly increased, reaching six or seven times their original price. Steerage ticket prices have increased more than tenfold. The most recent price increase was on the first of last month, and after just over a month, there is sudden news of another increase. The two companies have agreed to raise prices starting tomorrow (the 8th), but the new prices have not yet been announced as of last night. If there are no objections, the new prices will be implemented on the 8th.</p>

<h3>French Police Department Increases Salaries for Russian Police Officers</h3>
<p>The American newspaper Da Mei Wan Bao reports that the French Concession Police Department has uniformly increased the base salaries of Russian police officers, starting from September 1st. The amount of the increase varies depending on the length of their service, ranging from 50 to 150 yuan. In addition, Russian police officers will receive a subsidy of 50 yuan for each child born, and living allowances will also be fairly adjusted.</p>
<h3>Cooked Water Industry to Switch to No. 2 Slack Coal</h3>
<p>Since the Kailan Mining Administration entrusted the Coal Industry Association, including Huazhong, Yuantai, and Yitaixing, to sell its No. 3 slack coal at a fixed price, more than a year has passed. Recently, due to the decrease in the production of No. 3 slack coal, the Administration is unable to continue the practice, so it plans to temporarily suspend the sale of fixed-price slack coal, causing anxiety among cooked water shops throughout the city. They are requesting the Coal Industry Association to urge the Administration to maintain its original intention and sell other types of slack coal at a special price. It is learned that the Coal Industry Association and the Kailan Mining Administration are currently actively planning remedial measures to ensure the long-term sustainability of this charitable initiative. However, according to sources from the coal industry, the Kailan Mining Administration may switch to selling No. 2 slack coal, and its price will be slightly increased compared to No. 1 slack coal to compensate. The public hopes that the coal industry will implement this charitable initiative as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Taitong Case Trial Begins</h3>
<p>The American newspaper Da Mei Wan Bao reports that Taitong, the former execution officer of the U.S. Court for China, is currently imprisoned in Ward Road Prison awaiting trial for stealing public property and concealing the truth. It is heard that Special Commissioner Rudon will open the trial next Tuesday. According to Court Attorney Hill, Taitong is not likely to change his plea of not guilty. It is heard that the 1932 police record in San Antonio, Texas, USA, contains the crime of forgery by Taitong, who was named Sam Hunterick. The San Antonio Police Department still has an arrest warrant for Taitong, but it cannot be confirmed.</p>
<h3>"President Cleveland" Arrives in Shanghai; Over a Hundred American Nationals Evacuate; U.S. Consulate Has No New Measures for Evacuation; President Liners Will Arrive in Port Successively in the Short Term</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' Pacific route mail ship, "President Cleveland," is luxuriously equipped and previously converted for military use. It is well-known for its service between the Far East and the United States. It departed from San Francisco, USA, and arrived in Shanghai via Honolulu, Manila, and Hong Kong. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th and depart on the 11th, returning to the United States via Honolulu. It is heard that about a hundred American nationals are preparing to evacuate on the ship, some of whom recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the "Tatsuta Maru". Mr. Greiner, the secretary of the American Navy YMCA in Shanghai, is also one of those who have booked cabins on the "President Cleveland" to leave Shanghai. The YMCA held a farewell party for him the day before yesterday. The U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Lockhart, was also invited to attend. A reporter learned from the U.S. Consulate yesterday that there are currently no other new measures regarding the evacuation of American nationals in Shanghai. It is understood that there are still some American and other foreign nationals who wish to leave Shanghai but are temporarily unable to purchase cabins on the President Liner. However, it is heard that several President Liners will arrive in Shanghai in the short term, and then evacuees will have sufficient cabin space.</p>

<h3>Japanese Police Chief Shot in Japanese District of Eastern Shanghai; Miyachu Shot in the Shoulder; Major Search of Bridges on the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, the police chief of the Japanese Consulate General Police Department in Hongkou was suddenly shot near the intersection of East Hanbury Road and Choukiazong Road. He was hit in the shoulder by one bullet. Afterwards, the Japanese immediately launched a large-scale search for the shooter in the area but failed to find him. All bridges over the Suzhou Creek were also temporarily closed until noon. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ambushed on the Way to the Branch Office</p>
<p>The police chief of the Japanese Consulate General Police Department, Miyachu, left the police station yesterday morning around 8:00 AM with a police officer named Isoya to inspect the Yangshupu Peikai Er Road branch office. They were walking when two men suddenly jumped out from the side of the road near the open space at the intersection of East Hanbury Road and Choukiazong Road, firing at Miyachu.</p>
<p>Five Shots Fired, One Hit Shoulder</p>
<p>Miyachu was caught off guard and was shot in the left shoulder by one bullet. The assailant fired four more shots, but all missed, and then fled with their weapons, disappearing instantly. Although Miyachu was shot and bleeding profusely, he quickly ordered the accompanying officer to report the incident. After receiving the news, the Japanese immediately dispatched a military police squad, marines, and all police officers to surround the scene and apprehend the shooter.</p>
<p>Bridges over the River Reopened at Noon</p>
<p>An ambulance was immediately called to take Miyachu to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. At the same time, all bridges over the Suzhou Creek were closed, cutting off traffic. Even Westerners who wanted to enter the Hongkou district were stopped. However, the shooter was not found, and the bridges were reopened around noon, restoring traffic. However, the Japanese were conducting a very thorough search near the scene, and the situation was quite tense.</p>
<h3>Japanese National Robbed and Shot; Over 30,000 Japanese Yen Stolen</h3>
<p>Tsuki Jiji (age 35), an employee of the Shanghai Station Japan Express Maigen Road branch, was carrying 38,000 Japanese yen in cash from outside back to the branch at around 6:00 PM the night before last (the 5th). Unexpectedly, when he was near the station, three robbers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. One of them threatened him with a gun, while the other two forcibly snatched his cash-filled briefcase. Tsuki, unwilling to let go, tried to call the police. The robbers fired two shots at him, one of which hit him in the chest, immediately injuring him and causing him to fall to the ground. The three robbers fled with the loot. After the Japanese learned of the incident, they rushed the injured man to the hospital. It is reported that his injuries are severe.</p>
<h3>Hand Grenade Hidden Inside a Watermelon</h3>
<p>At 744 Xiaoshadu Road in the Public Concession, a hand grenade was discovered inside a watermelon at around 11:45 AM yesterday. The alleyway caretaker reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched officers to the scene to remove and destroy the grenade.</p>

<h3>Sino-Western Tennis Exhibition Tournament: Chinese Players Win All Singles and Doubles Matches; Xu Chengwei Wins Singles Against Kolarsha; Wang Li and Liang Cai Win Doubles</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club Summer Sports Group specially invited Chinese and Western tennis stars to hold a grand tennis exhibition to raise funds for the British War Relief Fund. It was held yesterday afternoon at 2:30 on the lawn in front of the Grand Stand of the Race Club, including three doubles matches and one singles match. As a result, all three Chinese teams won. The Grand Stand was full of spectators, making it the first grand occasion of this year's tennis season. After the competition, the British Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. George, gave a thank-you speech and then held a raffle before dismissing the crowd. The results of yesterday's competition are as follows:</p>
<p>Liang Baokui Cai Guoheng 6 3 6 2 Stock Sullivan</p>
<p>Xu Chengwei 7 5 6 4 Kolarsha</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Li Guofan 6 4 6 4 Squia Pennevey</p>
<p>First Match: Liang and Cai, two young players, were the first to take the stage, and their performance was very satisfactory. Liang has improved a lot compared to last year, and Cai's pairing is also appropriate. They are truly promising talents. Stock's panic was as before, with many points lost. Sullivan was also mediocre and unremarkable. In the first set, Liang and Cai led five to one before Stock and Sullivan managed to get two games. In the second set, Liang and Cai took the first four games in one breath, making it four to two, and then six to two.</p>
<p>Second Match: Xu Chengwei is a rising star, but his progress has not been great. It was not easy to win against Kolarsha yesterday. Kolarsha was originally a third-rate player. Xu's backhand was very good, and he scored points by hitting Kolarsha's backhand hard. The hits were wonderful, deep into the baseline. Neither of the two players could get to the net yesterday. Xu's draw shot showed that his skills were not deep, and the ball speed was very slow. In the first set, Kolarsha took the lead with three to one, Xu regained three games, and Kolarsha led with five to four. Xu won three consecutive games to make it seven to five. In the second set, Kolarsha again took the lead with three to two, and Xu fought to five to three, five to four, and then six to four.</p>
<p>Third Match: Squia and Pennevey were obviously no match for Wang and Li. Li Guofan did not perform well yesterday, so there was little competition. In the first set, Wang and Li took the first three games in one breath, Squia and Pennevey regained two games, and then each won one game, until it became six to four. In the second set, Wang and Li took the lead with three to one, each won a game, and also became six to four.</p>

<h3>How to Protect Our Lives</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunyuan</p>
<p>Early autumn is also the season when diseases are most prevalent. Many terrible germs, such as typhoid fever, dysentery, and malaria, are most active during this period. If we are not careful, we will get sick, suffer terribly, and even lose our lives without being treated in time. Wouldn't that be a pity?</p>
<p>Of course, exercising is the fundamental way to avoid all diseases. We should also pay special attention to the hygiene of our diet. The water we drink should be very clean and must be boiled. Do not drink raw water or eat raw or soaked fruits. Food should be fresh. Decayed food often has bacteria living in it, so do not eat it.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes and flies are carriers of various infectious diseases and should be diligently eradicated. Sweep away garbage and drain sewage to eliminate the source of mosquitoes and flies. As soon as mosquitoes and flies appear, immediately use mosquito coils, fly swatters, etc. to catch and kill them so that they disappear.</p>
<p>If you can gather a few children to organize a health promotion team to give lectures on health methods and perform health operas outside, wouldn't that be more valuable and meaningful? That would not only benefit society but also have many indirect benefits for yourself.</p>
<p>Although early autumn is a season of many diseases, children can safely get through it as long as they put each of these measures into practice. Even if you unfortunately suffer from a painful illness, you should seek medical treatment from a doctor as soon as possible. Do not be superstitious about ghosts and gods and throw away your life.</p>
<h3>Bad Habits in Doing Arithmetic</h3>
<p>— Ling</p>
<p>Xiao Xiong and Wuming are neighbors and study in the same grade at the same school. They are both playful children, so their academic performance is not good. Especially arithmetic, which they dread, so their grades in this subject are particularly poor, and they have to take supplementary exams when school starts. Xiao Xiong's older sister is very worried about them. Taking advantage of the free time during the holidays, she tutors them every morning. In the first few days, Xiao Xiong couldn't even distinguish between the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of applied four operations. Now he knows a little more. Wuming's level is better, and he can do mental arithmetic quickly, but when he does it, he is slow and makes many mistakes. For more than a month, they have not made much progress. Xiao Xiong's older sister is trying her best to get them to achieve the goal of accuracy and speed in arithmetic, and she is always paying attention to the reasons for their lack of progress in order to correct their mistakes. After more than a month of observation, she discovered that they have many bad habits when doing arithmetic.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiong doesn't like to think. When he encounters a difficulty, he doesn't think about it and refuses to do it anymore. He can only do it mechanically and doesn't know how to change and apply it flexibly. His mental arithmetic is also not fast. When calculating, he often has to count his fingers. For example, for ten plus four, he must count his fingers and say, "Fourteen? Fifteen, sixteen..." before he knows that fourteen plus four is eighteen. Not only does he have to count his fingers, but when he doesn't do multiplication and division, he seems to be reciting multiplication tables. For example, for two times nine, he must start from "two twos are four" before he knows that two nines are eighteen.</p>
<p>Wuming is very fast at mental arithmetic, but besides muttering multiplication tables, he doesn't concentrate when he does it. He either looks outside from east to west, or sits and daydreams. When he encounters a more troublesome part, he can do it but doesn't have any patience. Often, when asked a difficult division problem, he doesn't continue to do it after dividing halfway. Because he doesn't concentrate and doesn't have patience, he does it slower.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiong's sister summarized their bad habits as follows: 1. Unwilling to think, 2. Only knows how to do it mechanically, doesn't know how to change and apply it flexibly, 3. Counts fingers, 4. Recites, 5. Doesn't concentrate, 6. Doesn't have patience.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiong's sister is trying her best to eliminate their bad habits, such as mental arithmetic competitions! Calculating money in and out of daily life! But how can bad habits developed over many years be eliminated in a short period of time?</p>
<p>There are probably many children whose arithmetic grades are not good! Let's analyze ourselves to see what bad habits we have to get rid of. If we want to be good at arithmetic, in addition to the teachers bearing some responsibility, we must also always do mental arithmetic on daily problems, practice more, and apply it more. We must not have bad habits and also get rid of the fear of arithmetic. Then, the arithmetic grades this semester will definitely not be as bad as last semester.</p>
<h3>A Grain of Sand</h3>
<p>— Jichen</p>
<p>I remember in elementary school, I read a very meaningful English short story. Because it made such a deep impression on me, it is still deeply rooted in my mind.</p>
<p>The story begins by writing that someone bought a watch. The watch was very accurate at first, not missing a minute or a second. Naturally, he was very happy. But soon it started to run slower and slower, and finally stopped completely.</p>
<p>So, someone took it to the watch dealer where he bought it to repair it, wanting to find out why it stopped running. The repairman took a magnifying glass and carefully examined it, discovering a grain of sand embedded between the gears. He said to someone, "I can easily fix your watch. I understand why it stopped." So, he took a delicate pair of tweezers and gently removed the grain of sand. Sure enough, the watch started ticking again.</p>
<p>When someone saw the size of the grain of sand, not even the size of a small needle tip, he said in amazement, "I really didn't expect such a small thing to cause such great damage!"</p>
<p>"That's right," the repairman said, "This is a very small grain of sand; but it is because of this reason that it can hinder the movement of the gears. If it were not the size of a needle tip, it would never have gotten into the gap!"</p>
<p>The story ends here.</p>
<p>Children, are there any grains of sand in your behavior or thoughts, like the ones in the story? Lying, laziness, stealing, cheating, not working hard, not being thrifty, these are all tiny grains of sand that hinder the long-term progress of your knowledge and character! If you want a bright future, you must develop the courage to "know your mistakes and not hesitate to correct them" and completely remove the grains of sand that seem insignificant on the surface but are actually very harmful. Indulging in procrastination is destroying your promising future! Children, please remember this well.</p>
<h3>The Old Horse's Autobiography</h3>
<p>— Song Mingpei, Sixth Grade Student, Huzhou Shanghai Boarding School</p>
<p>My name is Harold, and I am a war horse.</p>
<p>When I was young, I was hung up in the air by people, and red-hot iron horseshoes were nailed to my feet. At that time, I was in great pain. But after a few days, I not only didn't feel pain, but walking became much more comfortable than before.</p>
<p>I once heard my master say that there was a man named Bole in the past who could know our ability to travel far without any error. It is a pity that he is no longer in the world. If he still existed, I would definitely visit him!</p>
<p>When I was twelve years old, I followed the army to the front line to serve. One night, our army launched a major offensive, and a fierce battle began. When I rushed into their defense line, I used my iron horseshoes to trample on those fierce people. At the same time, my master directed the soldiers to fight in the hail of bullets, truly courageous. In the roar of artillery fire, suddenly a grenade exploded in front of us. The fragments of the grenade injured my master's head and my leg. I looked up and saw a red landscape, with severed feet and broken arms flying in the air. After a while, my master gloriously sacrificed himself for the country. As he was dying, he said to me, "Har...old, we...are...parting...forever! You...you..." At this point, he choked and couldn't speak, and tears rolled down his face in strings. In addition to my grief, I couldn't help but become their prisoner. But I don't forget my master's hatred! I don't forget the humiliation suffered by my country!</p>
<p>It gradually got dark, and their camp was silent. Seeing an opportunity, I used all my strength to bite the reins and escape from their camp, returning to our army's defense line. Before long, I was sent to a field hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>After a few days, my leg injury healed, and I went to the front line to serve again, contributing a lot to the country. Later, because I was old, the new master couldn't bear to let me go to the battlefield, so I am now recuperating in the stable. I still get plenty of food to eat every day, so my old age is quite enjoyable.</p>
<h3>Sister is Sick</h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>I don't know how, but A-Liang's younger sister suddenly didn't want to eat her supper one afternoon during the last school term, and wanted to go to bed. Seeing her in this state, her mother naturally knew she must be feeling unwell. Otherwise, why wouldn't she want to eat her supper? Usually, she ate two bowls and still wasn't satisfied, wanting another half bowl. Her mother's appetite couldn't even match hers. All day long, she was lively, playing with the neighboring children in the alley, but now she wanted to go to bed and didn't even want to eat supper. This was not a good sign. Sure enough, her mother touched her forehead and felt a heat. She had a fever. She then told A-Ming to insert the thermometer under her tongue to measure her temperature. After a minute, they took it out and saw that the mercury column had risen more than two degrees. This made the mother busy: she told her sister to smell "shā" medicine, eat Zhi Shi (枳實, immature fruit of枳 Citrus aurantium), and told the maid to buy Wu Shi Cha (午時茶, Midday Tea) from the pharmacy to brew. She also bought some Pi Xiao (皮硝, sodium sulfate) and Zi Su (紫蘇, Perilla frutescens) to put in a cloth belt and tie around her stomach. The mother mumbled, "She must have a food-induced illness, catching a cold and eating too much." So whenever anyone in A-Liang's family had a minor ailment, they would first be treated with these four traditional remedies trusted by the mother for relieving indigestion and cold. Sometimes, she would even twist the "shā" on the back of their necks, leaving three obvious red marks, which was very painful. According to the mother, this was to let out some "qi." Originally, the sister was also supposed to taste this torture, but she was most afraid of pain, so the mother didn't force her too much. If it were someone else, she wouldn't have spared them and would definitely twist their "shā." The sister benefited from being the youngest among A-Liang's siblings. When the sister was about to sleep, she also took half an aspirin tablet, hoping that she would sweat a lot at night, and the fever might subside by tomorrow. "Dad, my sister's temperature is more than two degrees higher, so what is that exactly?" A-Liang asked his father. "The normal human body temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, your sister's temperature is around 100 degrees, so she feels afraid of the wind, and her nose and mouth are a bit hot, she can't eat, and she doesn't have energy, just wants to sleep."</p>
<p>"Dad, are you sure you measured it accurately just now? Because the air temperature is lower than the body temperature; wouldn't the mercury column drop as soon as the thermometer gets cold?"</p>
<p>"What you said is correct, it will indeed drop. This flaw was discovered when thermometers were first invented to measure body temperature. But now, look at this thermometer, the area near the mercury bulb is suddenly thinner. Why is that? It's to prevent the rising mercury column from being affected by other factors and dropping, so you can measure the accurate body temperature. Therefore, a thermometer cannot be used as a thermometer for measuring the weather, because it rises easily but drops with difficulty..." His father wanted to continue speaking, but at this moment, the mother told them not to talk too much, so as not to disturb the sick sister, so he promised his father to continue later.</p>

<h3>Yang Baosen Takes the Stage Again (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Shao Xian (from Beiping)</p>
<p>"However, Tianjin is currently inviting me. If Baosen is willing, we might as well cooperate in Tianjin first, wouldn't it be better to go to Shanghai later?" Yaoqing also understood Yanqiu's meaning. The father and son talked for a while, then Yanqiu said goodbye and left. This matter is set aside. Let's talk about Yang Baosen. Baosen has been performing in the North recently and has shown much improvement, and his art is also improving day by day. Huang Jin has long wanted to invite him to perform, because Baosen received a deposit from Huang Jin when he was in Shanghai the year before. However, Huang Jin's management believed that if Baosen was to be the leading actor, the second female lead must be either Huang Guiqiu or Hou Yulan. Huang and Hou's salaries were very considerable, and expenses would be high, making it difficult to make a profit. If the female lead was not as good, they were afraid they wouldn't be able to attract an audience, so they decided to invite Baosen and Yanqiu together. Baosen himself felt that having been the leading actor for more than a year, it wouldn't look good to be the second lead again. Moreover, the salary for the second lead would certainly be less than that of the leading actor, so he was unwilling to agree. On the day Baosen invited Jin and Sun, the representatives of Huang Jin from Shanghai, to dinner at Fengzeyuan, he expressed his intentions before the meal. As a result, Jin and Sun once considered inviting Chi Shigong instead, but because Shigong was short in stature, he was not a good match for Yanqiu, so they abandoned the idea and contacted Baosen again. Baosen's friends all suggested that he cooperate with Yanqiu. Yaoqing had also conveyed his meaning to Baosen, and because Baosen and Huang Jin had a long-standing friendship, Baosen finally agreed to cooperate with Yanqiu for a huge salary of nine thousand yuan. At the same time, because the Shanghai engagement of Baosen and Yanqiu was successful, Tianjin also followed Shanghai's lead in inviting Yanqiu and Baosen. Baosen will soon follow Yanqiu to Tianjin to perform at the China Theatre, and after the performances, they may go to Shanghai from Tianjin. With Yanqiu coming south, the lineup will be even more complete. Not only will the veteran Sheng Yi Wang Shaolou assist Yang Baosen, but Yu Zhenfei, who had been Yanqiu's partner for three years, will once again join hands with Yanqiu. To mention the affairs of the Cheng and Yu families is a long story, which will be explained in the next installment.</p>

<h3>(22) Paul Muni</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lang</p>
<p>At the mention of Muni, his calm, firm demeanor appears before our eyes. Although he did not graduate from any school, he is among the diligent in the vast Hollywood film city. Among the blockbuster movies he has starred in, "The Good Earth" probably leaves the deepest impression on us Chinese, and "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang" gives us new feelings. He was born on October 14, 1895, in Lemberg, Austria. At the age of eleven, he appeared in the "Yiddish" theatre, playing an unimportant elderly role. He married Bella Finkel in 1921, who greatly influenced him and brought about a great change in his acting. They still have no children. He is five feet nine inches tall and weighs 160 pounds. He likes wrestling games and also has a fondness for collecting ancient books.</p>
<h3>Blood and Beautiful Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Taking the Beloved Blackbird Out of the Cage Early</p>
<p>Wu Sangui, greatly favored, bowed to Emperor Chongzhen and said, "Your Majesty does not consider me, your humble servant, as mediocre, and has entrusted me with responsibility. I am grateful beyond words and am willing to devote all my efforts and loyalty to repay Your Majesty's kindness in the slightest." Chongzhen comforted him with some words and ordered a banquet to be held in the Hetede Hall, with court officials in attendance. At that time, Tian Hongyu was also present. Seeing Wu Sangui's extraordinary handsomeness, he felt a sense of respect. General civil and military officials saw that Wu Sangui was favored by the Emperor and praised him endlessly. After court, they invited each other for drinks, and Wu Sangui lingered in the capital unknowingly. When Tian Hongyu returned to his residence, he told Yuanyuan about Wu Sangui's affairs. Yuanyuan nodded and sighed, "General Wu is indeed a hero of our time. If he were to defend the capital and resist the rebels, Li Zicheng would be nothing to worry about." Tian Hongyu said, "Although that is what you say, the rebels are currently on a rampage, looting and burning everywhere, leaving no one alive. If they reach the capital, wouldn't this great city suffer disaster? I am very worried about this, as they pay special attention to the imperial clan and nobles. How can we escape?" As Tian Hongyu spoke, worry appeared on his face, and he repeatedly rubbed his hands. He was truly very worried in his heart, but what he was worried about was, after all, his own life and property. The survival of the country was secondary. So he said to Yuanyuan, "Yuanyuan, you are a smart person. If war breaks out here, how can we avoid it? At my age, must I suffer the disaster of war? It's truly a misfortune to be born at this time!" Hearing Tian Hongyu's words, Yuanyuan stared at his face, seeing that Tian Hongyu's old face was indeed full of sorrow, his brows tightly furrowed, and the wrinkles on his forehead were even more pronounced. She thought to herself, "You old man usually rely on your daughter's fortune to live in luxury, enjoying high office and riches, seeking only pleasure and profit every day. You are all parasites of the country, contributing nothing to the people." (16)</p>
