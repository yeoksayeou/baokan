<h3>美国決以物資援華　供應中國重要戰具</h3>
<p>購機事宜雙方在磋商中　一俟國會通過即可實行</p>
<p>華盛頓　美財長摩根韜宣稱、羅斯福總統擬將其軍械軍備租給英國應用之計劃、並適用於中國及希臘、蓋此項計劃、在總統為必要時、可適用於任何國也、查美總統之大量出賃軍備計劃、在國會一部分人士認為係規避瑣森法（即禁止賖款於任何賴債國家）之步驟、摩根　、此新計劃之實行、將有待諸國會之通過、而中國駐華盛頓之官員、已與美財部商討運輸戰鬥機之辦法、所苦者、美國現有飛機數量、不足供應耳、接近總統之非官方人員稱、美國深覺中國已經能遏阻日本、故較英國之處境為優、且日本所用飛機、新式及高度者絕無僅有、所用汽油、亦甚低劣、故在美國已視爲陳舊之機、中國正可用之、美財長又稱、英國購料委員會主席潑維斯、曾在白宮與總統會商及陳述英國之需要、潑氏謂「總統之計劃實開美國政策之新紀元、余當靜待國會之意見也、」（三十一日全眾社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美財長摩根韜答復關於美國以戰具借與希臘及中國事之問話、謂羅斯福總統租借戰具之計劃、可適用於任何人、此項計劃之適用範圍、將取決於國會云、按美總統原來建議、爲「如發生直接付款方法不復可用之局勢、則以軍用品租與英國」、（卅一日路透電）</p>
<h3>中英借款　延长半年</h3>
<p>紐約　哥倫比亞廣播公司及全國廣播公司頃謂均聞英國廣播公司所傳英政府決定、謂英國已將中英短期信用協定、再展長六個月、俾鼓勵中國利用英貸華之一千萬鎊購買英國物品云、（三十一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>馬來聯邦　將徽收所得稅</p>
<p>新加坡　此間人士頃信、海峽殖民地及馬來聯邦、因某委員會提議向人民所得中徵收戰爭稅、或將施行所得稅云、（卅一日合眾社電）</p>
<h3>利用飞行合堡壘　即可轟炸日本</h3>
<p>紐約「先驅論壇報」昨日稱、海軍部航空技術科科長韜爾少將、尸與共他專家聯合請求、以大量飛機援助中國、該「先驅論壇報」刊載華盛頓權威界消息稱、美國不日將以最少四百架戰機助華、韜爾少將稱、中國之需要不能忽視、而四百架不過爲最低數量而已、該報謂、目前在華盛頓之中國官員、方力說中國對新式飛機之需要、因日本採用新型美塞斯米式之驅逐機也、該報稱、畀予中國之飛機將包括美國陸軍部之著名「波音式」「飛行堡壘」六架、該報指稱、此種飛機將令中國力能對日採取攻勢、並作夜襲、「先驅論壇報」此種消息透露、繼羅總統之「爐邊談話」以後發出、羅總統在演說中稱讚中國在東方之「大保衛」、並承諾極力以物質援華云、現時供給中國飛機之計劃、因英國之需要飛機遠較中國緊急、故遲遲未能實現、中國欲得者爲驅逐機至少一百架或四百架、外加少數之長距離轟炸機、宋子文氏現尙未與進出口銀行簽訂美金一萬萬元之借據、原因爲目下並無飛機等現貨可得、消息靈通者不信美國將以最新式之飛機交與中國、惟知美陸軍有時期較早之飛行堡壘一批、約十七架、大約可讓給中國使用、因此批巨型機現已有更新式之出品替代也、此種飛行堡壘一次可連續飛行三千英里、裝炸彈二噸、每小時飛二百五十英里、中國得此、即可每夜柱炸日本、主管方面聲稱、美陸軍之各轟炸機漸在擱置作廢、必於換新式者、故須現有飛機一部、當可交中國利用、美政府官員及中國財政部人員兩方、關於購機事、磋商已久、但全部辦法尙未議成云、（三十一日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>總統爐邊談話　對日有力警告</h3>
<p>華盛頓　政府官員多人昨日相信羅斯福總統星期日晚上之爐邊談話、乃一反對日本之文吿、此外並發表具有歷史性之美國遠東政策云、聯邦安全行政員麥克納脫吿合衆社記者稱、「該演辭無異警吿日本及其餘兩軸心國家、謂美國準備以軍事方式維持民主國之權益、」麥克納脫並盛贊總統之演詞、稱之爲「完全勇敢直前」、明證民主黨參議員奢門氏認爲羅氏關於遠東之言辭、頗屬重要、渠稱「總統向世界公佈、美國必不接受亞洲獨裁者之哲學、若其決不接受歐洲獨裁之哲學、同一立塲、」政治觀察家則咸注視總統關於「夏威夷艦隊」之語詞、僉認足以令人產生深刻之印象、等認爲該語無異表示美國艦隊在遠東緊張局勢未能解除之前、將長久留駐於夏威夷方面、彼等復認爲同時亦足以視爲一種警吿、謂美國艦隊已準備對任何侵犯美國權益之行動予以反抗、總統在演說中、將日本列入德義同一地位中、並鄭重聲明三角聯盟、實爲對美國之威脅、渠並無異對松岡洋右之保證、謂軸心國之聯盟並非針對美國一事、加以拒絕、此外復有一事値得重視者、即爲羅氏對歐亞兩洲之所謂新秩序、一律以譴責之態度出之云、（三十一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間人士皆料東京對於美總統「爐旁談話」中關於東方軸心國之言論、必一再展讀研究而熟思之、日外相松岡所發美國如不改變其爲日本所反對之外交政策、則唯有戰爭耳一說、其不爲美國所重視而不能絲毫影響也、羅斯福總統已於此次演詞中明白言之、無以復加、總統演詞</p>
<p>中有一節、僅作一句、即太平洋中吾人之艦隊在焉、」總統於此句前後、故作停頓、不加他語、蓋此句之意義已極明顯、無贅言之必要也、總統並明白宣稱渠見中國之對日抗戰乃民治國對惡勢力謀世界之征服與統治者奮鬥之一部、紐約時報以議刺口吻評論日本、謂日本竭力仿摹德國之行爲、欲利用泰國如希特勒之利用蘇台德然、但若越甫步朝鮮及中國東三省與東北之後、併入日本版圖、則泰國所必有之覺悟、將爲如何耶云、（三十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　讀賣新聞批評美總統羅斯福之廣播謂、美總統之政策、現驅美國更接近戰爭、美總統所稱渠信軸心國終將失敗一節、可視爲完全不負責任之談、無論來年局如何、美國必須半負其責、東京此間因日本正式新年休假已於十二月廿八日開始、政府及各行政官署須至一月四日始恢復辦公、故官方對於羅斯福總統演說之批評、尙不可知、惟試將負責方面之意見加以檢討、即可發見日本消息靈通之人士、皆認爲羅總統對於日本屢次所發三國公約目的不在美國、及日本「東亞新秩序」並非由於帝國主義目的之言論、均有意置諸不見不聞、羅總統所稱軸心國之新秩序、志在藉非神聖之同盟奴役全世界一說、聞已引起日本人士之特別不滿、謂日本之觀點、已由日外相松岡在十二月十九日美日協會歡送新任駐美大使野村席上之演辭中、重作申述矣、（三十一日路透社電）</p>
<h3>冀魯豫區　日私貨減少</h3>
<p>鄭縣　華北之—對日經濟戰、仍在激烈進行中、自華經委會貨運稽查會先後成立機構加强、豫省每月八百萬元之漏巵、逐漸杜止、冀魯豫區稽查會、係本年五月間成立、緝獲案件、以沒收罰金補稅三法處理、日私貨物以布疋紙烟顏料等大宗、文具雜品次之、醫業五金甚少、由於查緝工作之推進、各稅收機關稅額旺暢、多超疇昔數倍、記者沿河巡視、覩鄭州漯河界首等地工作甚爲緊張、聞日方已禁阻英美貨向游搫區流入華內地、（三十日電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>迎一九四一年</h3>
<p>今日是公歷一九四一年元旦。在中國：遠溯黄帝甲子即位，迄今四千六百三十八年；締造共和，民國三十年；開始抗建偉業，已歷五個年頭，今日是艱苦中第四度元旦</p>
<p>今年元旦，將不僅因爲歲序更始而慶賀，除舊布新而歡迎。懷抱了希望，每每是有力的鼓勵，每每是成功的因素，今年却把握住了所希望。昏沉的長夜確乎已經過去，曙光開始了吐露新氣象，忠貞淬厲的人們共同踏上了光輝燦爛的前途；這不是禱祝之辭，而是朕兆昭著的趨嚮，是翹企可望，指日可期的事實。讀者諸君啊！開門七件事，家家如此，天天如此，而現代生活則人件事；八件事中讀報是第一事，今年第一天第一事對於讀者所報道的，今年是勝利年，亦即四五年來遭際的苦難，付出的代價，今年該是收成了。</p>
<p>世界的變亂，一九三一年九一八最先發端於遠東；像疫病相傳染，像波浪相推動，像水滲透，像火蔓延，一日復一日，一處復一處，變亂遂廣大深刻到目前情狀；很可能的，最後結束於遠東吧！當然，或因中國計畫的總反攻收穫了預定的事功，或因國際壓力的强化而見效，或因侵略者的內竭而崩潰，使遠東局勢急轉直下，較他處先行結束；這是意中之事，且是合理的步調。但儘可不作如是想而假定遠東不免結束在後，則他處旣因現代戰爭必經不起數决大規模的攻勢而不難結束，遠東必緊緊跟着他處的結束而結束。試爲檢討於大規模攻勢之前的今日，在同盟三國方面：其間的貌合神離，其合作的偏枯而寡效，其於國際的最近所謀輒左，其先天貧乏與後天斲喪的補救無術，其作戰本質的不進不勝便是隤下與失敗，皆有事實做說明。在對抗同盟的方面：則中國因自力與外援而徐向最後勝利之途前進，英國已克服危機而轉變於優勢，希臘正在繼續其意外的大勝之中；美國雖不直接參加戰爭，然最近已公開宣示其與中英希的勝敗禍福相一致，且儘其偉大雄厚，舉世無兩的國力，援助中英希三國，爭取勝利；三國固堅持抗戰的決心，美國亦吾認從事於苟且的圖謀和平，兩相比較，中英希必勝無疑。同盟國必敗無疑。彼在必敗之數，祇因騎虎難下，故仍行險徼倖，行將試爲數决的大規模攻勢，自屬事所必至。這是容易想像而無妨論斷的：數决大規模攻勢當在今年春夏之間，或猶不待夏季，更難挨過秋天。秋天是自然的收成季節吧！</p>
<p>當然，誰多知道不容不勞而獲，不容坐待收成，而收成前之最後一霎那，必須流最後的血汗。一年之計在於春，今年應怎樣準備最後血汗的交流，應怎樣適應最後勝利的來臨？這在必勝的信心之下，歡迎一九四一年元旦的同時，每人所願嚴肅的虔敬的，接受這一課題。</p>
<h3>今年可珍的禮物</h3>
<p>一個還沒有直接參戰國家的元首，竟能義正辭嚴地，發出前天那樣痛斥德義日，聲援中英及一切反侵略國家的演說。這祇有於上决歐戰時，最後突然參戰，一舉而確定英法勝利的美國，及十九世紀帝國主義共謀瓜分中國時，以一紙「門戶開放」宣言，確定中國完整的美國，纔有這樣的魄力。而且，也祇有破天荒連任三元首，深受全美人民擁護的羅斯福，纔敢這樣代表一萬五千萬美國公民，大膽發言。觀察國際當前及未來的形勢，這篇演說，實有其劃時代的意義！</p>
<p>羅斯福總統在他的演說裏，曾經特別闡明保持美國不捲入戰爭的計劃，即爲盡力援助中英，使擊敗軸心國及日本。在美國這樣的援助裏，當然包含着牠自己與三國正面衝突的危機；羅斯福亦必將這一危機估計了，而後毅然下這最後決心。分析來說，他以參戰的決心，盡力援助中英，擊敗三國，而仍望美國終能避免戰爭的慘痛。個中利害比較，羅氏演說裏已加明白指陳。蓋三國盟的的簽訂，是對美威脅的第一步；三個月來，德義日各級的發言人，一再此唱彼和，對美國恫嚇，這是第二步；而最近幾天來，德國的艦隊，竟在日本合作之下，開始在太平洋攻擊英國船隻，在這第三步，戰爭的觸鬚，實已延擴到了太平洋。形勢旣迫使美國接近戰綫，美國作戰猶所不辭，何况對中英的援助。因此之故，羅氏演說後，美國將以大量武器借予中國的計議，跟着透露遐邇。詳如電訉，不復徵引。雖從目前到計議的成立與實行，空間時間各有相當距離，但是這所表示對中國的實心實意，實力聲援，亦已成爲中國所樂予接受的可珍禮物。</p>

<h3>大批日軍集中　廣州附近</h3>
<p>重慶　此間對於外傳大批日軍集中廣州附近之說、巳引起許多揣測、衆信因目前粤北並無大規模日軍行動之徵象、此項軍隊或係集中以作進取香港之準備、大的將先襲攻九龍區域、據云日方之進攻香港、或將與歐洲之新的軸心活動、及未來之日軍攻搫越南南部、同時發生、認爲沿泰國邊境戰釁之重開、意義特別重大、現時集中廣州附近之日軍確數、雖尙不可知、惟聞在過去兩週中、集於該處之日軍、至少已有五萬人、據粤省前錢傳來之消息、估計此項日軍的在七八萬人之間但信五萬人之說較爲可靠、（三十一日路透社電）</p>

<h3>元旦獻詞與　回望上海</h3>
<p>— 吳開先</p>
<p>値茲中華民國三十年的建國紀念，瞻念前途，回望上海，使我頓有無限的感奮：</p>
<p>第一，今年適爲中華民國三十年，古人以三十年爲一世，很重視「三十」這一個數字。個人的長成實在與國家的發展相彷彿的。孔子說：「吾十有五而志於學，三十而立，」這個「立字」，何晏集解說是「有所成立，「朱子註說：有以自立，」大意都是相同的。一個人在社會上，到了三十歲時，實應該「有以自立。」一個國家也是如此，孔子說：「如有王者必世而後仁，「這個意思就是說：「如有受天命而王天下者，必三十年，而後仁政乃成。」所謂「三十而立」，所謂「必世爾後仁，」這都是與我們今年民國三十年必須完成建國政策的意義相適合的，我們的所謂建國政策，在古人當簡稱爲「建政」，完成建國政策就是古人所期的必世而後仁。完成建國政策，我們國家在國際社會間才有以自立，這在我們三十年的元旦，每個人都應該以此深自勵惕的。</p>
<p>第二，我在上海讀書和工作，的有二十餘年，上海實是我的第二故鄉。前年秋天我曾回過上海一次，上海環境的惡劣是我親眼所看見，並且是我親身所經歷的。上海同胞的堅忍苦鬥，咬緊牙關，勉渡困境的情况，是我親眼所看見，也是我衷心所最欽佩的。這還是一年以前的情况，現在環境料想當然比一年前更爲惡劣，同胞們堅忍苦鬥的精神也當然比一年前更値得欽佩。我的身體雖然是在陪都，我的眼總是常常回望上海，我們心總是常常顧念上海同胞和友朋的苦鬥。我應該乘這建國紀念吉辰深致我個人的關懷和欽佩。</p>
<p>第三，上海過去的環境固然惡劣，今後數月內或將更加困苦。今後上海第三國的一切商務利益固然將受到打擊，同時五百萬市民的經濟生活也感受　　的威脅，但是中國法幣基礎的鞏固，決非任何企圖所能搖撼，　　　　　　　　　　。甚望上海同胞能顧全大局，忍受一隅一時的痛苦，苦盡甘來，我們應牢記這一句話。</p>
<p>第四，中國現在到了三十年的年頭，確已到了，三十而立」應當有所成立的時期了。三年半的奮鬥，我們已經收穫了美滿的效果。在目前的歐陸風雲，雖屬另一地區另一壁壘的戰爭，事變的演進，雖另有其內在的和國際的矛盾根本因素，但野心啟發，未嘗不是受了遠東的刺激。自從三國盟的簽訂以後，東西兩大戰爭，在形勢上已經合流，日本的南進企圖，雖然正從事盤馬蠻弓步步爲營的準備，可是實際上，仍徘徊瞻顧，老其所以然者，一方面固由於美國態度的强硬，但中國的繼續作戰，究屬爲主要的決定力。惟其如此，所以日趨强大的中國，便成爲遠東眞正的安定力，而得到國際的同情和援助。美國一萬萬美金和英國一千萬磅的貸與，蘇聯除駐日大使史密太寗聲明「對華政策仍無變動外」，幷與中國簽立新貿易協定，這一切，決不是偶然的，乃是我們堅決奮鬥的結果。</p>
<p>現在正踏入偉大的民國三十年，民族抗爭歷史，又展開新的一頁。我們無論是軍事方面，政治方面，或外交方面，都顯然處於主動的地位，中國的自由獨立，關係於我們民族今後千萬年之生存與幸福，同時，也關係於世界和平人類文明之再建。我們的責任，實異常重大，目前的工作，自格外艱難。全國同胞在此光明降臨前的一剎那，務須認識民族自由，個人纔有自由，國家利益，高於私人利益。且必須忍受痛苦，堅定信仰，在抗建大目標之下，共同努力，以完成民族解放的使命。</p>
<p>我在這三十年建國紀念吉辰，瞻念前途，回望上海，實有無限的感奮，爰坦白的率直的略舉上述四點，以代新歲致其欽佩與祝贊的微意，並望各盡其艱難困苦之努力，脫離困阨，重獲光明爲期必不甚遠。</p>

<p>一年以來的軍事、始終保持着穩定胡形勢、鄂中之棧、雖略有進退、而日人的活動的范圍、終不能脫離我軍的控制、上月鄂北大捷、允使宜沙殘日陷於危殆的境地、而綏西的空前大捷、晋南的屢殲日軍、日人費盡九牛二虎之力、於去年之間、侵入桂南、終因我方的嚴重壓迫、在本年十月間撤退、得失之間、可以看出日人兵力單薄、顧此失彼的窘促狀態、這和抗建初期的情形、已大不相同了、</p>
<p>在外交方面、最値得吾人記憶的、有西南國際運輸路綫的對閉與開放、和三國間盟的成立、與日在「的」的簽訂、這幾件事的經過、雖甚曲折、而最後的演變終於我有極大的利益、德國的閃電戰、擊潰了法波、佔據了荷蘭比利時、不數月間歐洲大部河山風雲色變、英倫三島重受威脅、日人乘此時機、大施伎倆脅誘各國「希圖達到他乘火打刦的目的、我政府始終守着堅定的立塲、應付任何事變、意外來的壓迫、固不足以影響我們的抗建國策、然當時國際局勢的可能發展、確爲國人焦慮的中心、而滇緬公路的運輸、就在這個黯淡的氣氛中、被宣出口封閉、國人精神上的抑鬱、亦听難免、直至德義日三國同盟成立宣佈後、全世界愛好和平的人士、乃憬然覺悟日人野心之無止境、而知吾人之抗建、於東亞大局、及世界和平、實有重大的貢獻、於是國際輿論一旦轉變、滇緬路重行開放了、英美對我借款、相繼成立、日本人所仰給於美國的軍用物資却却被一再的限制輸出了、這一個急迫的轉變、不啻撥雲見日、使國際閒重現正義之光、三國同盟與日在訂的、在日人自以爲無上的法寳、其實是弄巧成拙、加緊其崩潰的速率、是非順逆、甚爲明白、中國抗建前途、更得到有利形勢、</p>
<p>就一般的行政來說、政府對抗建同時並進、新縣制的逐漸實施、尤為過去一年來內政上的完成國民革命的根本、爲圖樹立國家長治久安的基礎、中央爲促成新縣制的實現所予補助、並巳經劃撥印花稅收入的三成、歸地方應用、叉鑒於國民敎育程度的提高、和經濟生活的改善、爲建國的百年大計、故對於促進後方生產、普及國民敎育、皆再接再厲、努力推動、本年春夏之交、由行政院組織政務巡視團、遴選大員、赴各省考查施政情形、察訪民間疾苦、綜其考察結果、在抗建期間、各省地方政治一般的都有進步、這於安定後方、促進建設、都有良好的影響、更可知我國家復與建設之機運、亦已隨戰事而啟導其端、</p>
<p>經濟作戰、爲決定抗建勝負的主要因素允爲目前全國人民注意的中心、誠以戰事延長愈久、經濟問題愈趨重要、這是現代戰爭中極普遍、極自然的趨勢、但是有的人不明白這個道理、又因見今日上自總裁、下至政府各級人員、都注意這個問題、就以爲我國經濟現狀有什麼特殊危機、遂以誤傳誤、自相驚擾、造成一種心理上的恐慌、這便是不明白現代戰爭的基本原則、及其自然趨向、我們不否認中國當前確有一個重要的經濟問題、須待吾以最大的決心與毅力、謀其解決、但此並非謂我國經濟社會中、現在遭遇了什麼嚴重的危機、這是國人必須深切瞭解的、</p>
<p>在當前胡經濟問題中、物價又佔了問題的核心、若有干不通曉現代經濟學的人、又發生種種疑問、驚相揣測、殊不知物價在現代經濟學中、向來佔有中心地位、在戰時允其如此、政府與人民近來以全副力量、來解決物價問題、即以此故、蓋漲價問題把握住了、別的問題亦可以迎刃而解、這是具有現代經濟常識的人所一定能够了解的、可以不再贅說、惟是現代經濟問題、最爲複雜、幾與整個社會的各方、都有連帶的關係、這也便是說物價問題不是一個簡單的問題、更難用一個簡單的公式、將共解決的、我們須要一方面策劃週全、將各種因素全都顧到、一方面更要審度目前財力人力的狀况、爲適當的處置、分別緩急、先後按步進行、而於目前軍事外交、允不能使其有絲毫不良的影響、否則便要牽動整個的抗建大局、在過去數年中、政府即本此方針、努力進行、近半年來、允爲積極、行政院爲使各主管經濟機構能運用靈活、互相聯繫起見、近來特設經濟會議、每週集會一次、並於每月舉行會報一决、又參照七中全會的決議、在行政院中設立物資總監部、負責抗建時經濟行政事務、俾力量集中事權統一、希望不久便可以正式成立、過去數月中、因爲糧僭高漲、影響人民生活至深且鉅故於行政院中特設全國糧食管理局、統制全國的糧食、在省縣政府中、亦均添設了糧食管理機構、運用政府的力量、謀求糧食合理胡產銷、以平抑其價格、其餘關於人民生活必需品、也由主管機關切求其價格之平允、以裕民生、還是近年在政治機構上的設施、對於糧食問題、現已定有治標及治本胡具體辦法、分令全國實施在治標辦法中、最重要的是力求糧食來源之舒暢、不許各縣阻糧輸出吸收各地餘糧、以供應市場、以達到貨暢其流的目的在治本辦法中則在增加生產、疏濬來源、並根據各地胡生產消費情形、限制人民多儲餘糧、及嚴密取締囤積居奇必須物品、一面按法科刑、一面採取糧價物價工價同時平價、及定期抑價胡方針、並由政府撥鉅款、分別購運、平價出售、以供給市面、這種種辦法、自施行以來、已收到相當的效果、等到治本辦法實行暢利以後、物價的問題、當可逐漸得到解決、（未完）（卅一日播）</p>

<p>自由中國　積極建設</p>

<h3>上海人該怎麼辦</h3>
<p>— 荘甫</p>
<p>在歷史大轉變的前夜，在遠東戰爭和歐陸風雲交流的今日，我國抗建神聖任務的重要性，更日益顯明；因爲我們的作戰，不僅是爲了自己的獨立和生存，抑且是爲了世界和平與正義，它的目標，雖然是自求解放，可是它的成果，却影響到人類的前途。</p>
<p>三年半以來，我們的實力，已愈戰愈强，軍事上，政治上，外交上，均以飛躍的姿態，處於主動的地位。對方的政治攻勢，旣被我們偉大的民族精神所粉碎，軍事侵略，也陷於脆弱無力瀕於崩潰的狀態，外交經濟，更是步步荊棘，如火自焚。他們在一籌莫展的情形下，只得藉阿汪條件，實行自我麻醉，且以之敷衍國內民衆，客觀形勢，巳證明我國是光明在望，而對方則日薄崦磁</p>
<p>中華民國三十年的元旦，無疑地，正是最後勝利的曙光的透露，這一年，將是我們發動總反攻獲取國家自由獨立的新階段。不過在淪陷區，尤其是烟霧迷漫的孤島上，光明前的一瞬，必然更艱難，更黑暗，更危險，我們只要能堅定抗建信念，忍受一時痛苦，突破黑暗，前面便是幸福之路。</p>
<p>須知他們固然是企圖打擊我們的軍事實力，同時，也企圖打擊我們革命精神。如其我們的精神不能振奮，意志不能集中，則戰時生活，也必然陷於苟且偷安，或自私自利，甚至走進預設的圈套，誠所謂「鎖練一經套上，百世不能解脫，精神一經屈服，就將萬刦沉淪，」這就是迎接勝利年的中國大衆所應該警惕的。</p>
<p>因此，我們目前所應該實踐的是：</p>
<p>第一，生產建設是民族經濟建設的重要部份，也是充實作戰力量的大前提。本市因戰時人口增加，遊資充斥，又以環境險惡，不能發展正當事業，於是投機取巧者，便利用之以獵取不正當的利潤。非法營私，無異資助日本，囤積操縱，動輒影響民生，忽視國家之存亡，圖遂個人之貪慾，良心縱不自責，國法亦終不予以姑容。何况孤島危機，正方興未艾，與其坐待不可測之損失，母寗移資內地，從事生產建設，以達到沒有廢人廢時發地廢物的境界，而促進最後勝利的速至。</p>
<p>第二，學校是培養革命青年的園地，同時，更是發展中國文化的堡壘，敎育界的責任，較其他各界尤爲重大，應付惡劣環境，也較他人為不易。不過我們對於順逆大義，既有深刻的認識，對於抗建國策，又有堅强的信仰，自不會因威脅利誘或稍受挫折而起動搖。敎育界非但要對國家，對民族，忠貞不二，問心無愧，而且要積極地負起救國建國的使命，即使萬一受到黑暗勢力的壓迫，致不能維持現狀時，也應堅持不妥協的精神奮鬥到底，全市的青年一定跟隨着師長們，來根絕毒素敎育的流播；况且關係當局已在籌謀補救的辦法，對敎育界同人的生活，決不漠視。</p>
<p>第三，去歲由於統制加緊，奸商的囤積居奇，物價高昂，生活日困，因之，此洛彼起的工潮，也特別嚴重。其中原因，固大半爲生計問題所驅使，而奸人之乘火打刦，藉故煽動，以冀發生政治進攻的作用，亦不無蛛絲馬跡可尋。我們深望在此行將破曉前的一刹那，應發揮勞資互助的精神，資方必須在物價高漲的情形下設法改善勞工生活，同時勞方非至萬不得已時不以罷工相要挾，以渡過此最後的難關，須知目前的艱難困苦，是侵略勢力所造成，只有中國獲得眞正自由獨立之時，才是本市同胞重慶更生之日，否則，勞資雙方必將因環境之益趨險惡而同歸於盡，這是不可不注意的。</p>
<p>以上三點，是本年元旦最低限度的希望，也是爭取民族解放的必要條件。中國經過三年半的苦戰，及最近局勢的發展，確信必獲最後勝利，且勝利之期，巳不在遠，勝利的關鍵，現在是握在每一個同胞手上。</p>

<h3>中國怎樣長期作戰（一）</h3>
<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>中國駐美大使胡適之先生，前在紐的第三屆「一碗飯」運動的宴會上，發表一篇很動人的演說，就是「美國人的同情心」，其原文已載去年十二月十六日本報。昨天，我們又收到從美國航郵寄來的胡大使講稿「中國怎樣長期作戰？」</p>
<p>這又是以學者眼光來分析遠東大戰因素的一篇名著。無疑的，中華民族自二千一百年以來，是一向生活於一個國家，一個政府，一種法律，一種文字，一個敎育制度和一個歷史文化之下。道一種統一生活下的民族，在任何民族或任何歷史中，找不出一樣的例子來。胡大使便是以研究歷史的方法和觀點來說明了中國民族怎樣長期作戰？</p>
<p>在迎取勝利年的元旦，我們把這一篇名著登出來，許是値得讀者們的玩味罷！</p>
<p>中國對日本侵略的作戰，到了一九四〇年十一月第一個星期的週末，有整整四十個月的歷史。中國已作戰到三年四個月了。</p>
<p>這一個戰爭，對於事前毫無準備而向來愛好和平的像我們中國這樣的民挨，是一個多麼堅苦的戰爭，我可以不必說明，想你們也會知道的。你們知道中國已失去了不少重要的領土，並已喪失了無數的生命。你們知道日本人幾乎已完全控制了我們的上空和海面，以及重耍的鐵路綫和水道。你們知道我們所有一切貿易，工業，敎育，文化的中心城市，從北平到席州，從上海到宜昌，差不多都已被侵略者蹂躪或佔領了。</p>
<p>你們知道我們所有的幾所著名的大學和學院，幾乎都已遷移到內地去了，牠們上課大半沒有書本，沒有實騐室的設備，並且時常受到空襲的危險。你們知道二年以來，我們所有的一切海上通路，差不多完全已被切斷，而不得不依靠三處「後戶」，來運取我們來自海外的軍需品，和輸送我們藉以換取外滙的輸出品。你們也知道在這三處「後戶」當中，通達蘇聯的一條陸路，僅適合於運輸輕量的貨物；過越南的一條鐵路，自今年夏季法國崩潰以來已被封鎖，而目下實際上已被侵越的日軍所攫去；著名的緬甸公路被英國封鎖了三個月，這是最近重啟的。</p>
<p>今天並不是要把這些災難困苦的故事和那些幾乎無法克服的困難向你們告訴。不是的！我在這裹是要告訴你們：雖然在艱苦困難之中，中車仍舊繼續作戰。</p>
<p>你們現在目見兩件活的奇蹟：英國的戰爭和中國的戰爭。世界人士已開始覺察到中國和英國是兩個僅有的國家，這兩個國家仍舊還在以武力反抗侵略，而中國的從事於作戰，巳有了三個長而堅苦的年頭了</p>
<p>你們或許要問：在道樣困難的環境之下，歐洲許多勢力更强而武備更優的國家，尚且不免於一一屈服，何以中國能作戰到如此長久呢？我來試把幾個原因解釋一下。</p>
<p>中國在天賦上和遺傳上有三件爲歐洲幾個屈服的國家所間；第二，龐大的人力，第三，民族團結的歷史意識。</p>
<p>廣大的空間和龐大的人力是很明顯的，可以不必詳細解釋。我只要說日軍的佔領中國領土，祇限於幾個大的城市和一些交通綫，到了今天，日本能吾自稱已控制了中國十分之一以上的領土，還是很使人懷疑的。關於人力，甚至日軍高級統領人員自己也公開認蔣介石將軍仍有三百萬訓練優良的軍隊，那就是說，日本也承認今日中國軍隊的人數，除去游擊隊不算外，較之三年前戰爭爆發時更來得多了。</p>

<h3>沙遜爵士自印歸滬　泛諭一般局勢　謂美日開戰徒有利德國　上海局勢終可保持中立</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本市著名金融家沙遜爵士、近從印度返、今日（三十一日）在華懋飯店內招待新聞記者、談論世界大局、如美日開戰可能性、與蘇義兩國在納粹「生活空問」計劃中担當之職使等、以至上海情勢、</p>
<p>蘇聯封日自由行動</p>
<p>據稱、德國將在巴爾斡半島施閃電戰一節、渠頗懷疑、因此舉將損害該半島來歲夏季之穀收、致危及德國之食物接濟也、德國長此對英作戰、即不欲「騷擾」蘇聯、但願對蘇保持諒解、而聽蘇聯對日本自由行動、此舉正中蘇聯之懷、</p>
<p>德國極願日美開戰</p>
<p>日木現正被德國利用、而希特待勒所以利用日木者、欲償其私願而已、日本若竟對美作戰、得其利者、唯德國耳、因屆時美國擬接濟英國之戰具、大部份必留供自用、則英國對德報復力將减弱、且日本對美作戰、其接濟品之運輸、必受美潛艇之重大威脅、日本貯油尚充、惟鋼鐵與棉、匱乏已極、故信日本不欲對美開戰、美國亦然、</p>
<p>上海局勢不受打擊</p>
<p>沙遜又答覆問話稱、歐戰至少復将賡續兩載、英政府政策、则以持久作戰三年之可能性爲基礎、而軍火廠與種種戰時活動亦皆以此基礎擬定計劃云、沙遜末稱、渠於六閱月前離滬時、對於此間局勢、頗感担憂、惟今信上海可保中立、而不受打擊、寬心不少、蓋上海除闢爲公共租界外、對於任何人、別無用途也、</p>

<h3>米蠧逾限交易　當局查有實據　過去麺粉平賣合作圓滿　兩粉廠收益減少百餘萬</h3>

<p>平麺概況</p>
<p>本埠自滬戰以還、糧食問題、常感困難、而麺粉一項、亦爲民食需要中之重要部份、往往以售價高漲、奸商囤積居奇、平民需粉、不易購到、工部局爲抑平售價、調劑民食起見、曾于二十九年初、商得阜豐福新兩麵粉廠之同意、凡兩租界麵粉號之另售交易、由工部局妥爲支配、視用戶需要之多寡、以定購買之數額、以資調節、嗣于二月六月間、先後召集各麵粉號來局開會、決定各該粉號所售之粉、依照廠盤另加手續費三角、用戶需粉、應先向工部局申請、經核准後、再憑函持向粉號備價購粉、所幸買賣雙方、均能遵守規定辦理、故結果頗稱圓滿、一般小本經紀、以及勞働階級、得以維持生活、而粉市始終比較穩定、</p>
<p>共售三期</p>
<p>查第一期辦理麵粉平賣、係于上年二月十火日起至三月十九日止、由阜豐福新兩廠每日供給各粉號麵粉七千五百包、廠盤每包十元、粉號門市加手績費三角、不得超過、各粉號熱心服務、固堪嘉尙、而阜豐福新兩廠顧念民食、平價售粉、其犧牲精神、允可欽佩、曾由工部局前總董樊克令君專函兩廠、表示感謝、第二期平賣、自七月二日起、經匝月有餘、方吿結束、第三期平賣始于九月二十七日、迄年終爲止、由兩廠每日供給麵粉八千餘包、（十二月間减爲五千六百四十六包）、其間因洋麥來價較昂、故廠盤曾數次提高、俾廠方勉够成本、而麵粉正常供給、不致短絀、綜計兩廠因歷决平賣麵粉、全年約减少收益一百餘萬元、嘉惠平民、維持治安、令人感佩</p>
<p>洋行合作</p>
<p>十一月二十六日、工部局糧食委員會主席馬歇爾氏、曾分函維大·合義·達孚·怡和·公利·各洋粉進口行、請其轉商各定戶、提出定貨十分之一、轉發各粉號、平價發售、售價定爲每包十八元（與本街廠盤相同）、外加手續費三角、各洋行對于上項建議、無不表示贊同、應允照辦、而各定戶亦能顧全當局安定粉市之苦心、慨予合作、迄年底爲止、先後抽提洋粉四次、合計七萬一千九百九十六包、除分發各粉號平價發售用戶外、尙凈餘二千七百包、已由工部局全數售與上海慈善團體聯合會、以便烘製饅首、賑濟貧民、故抽提之洋粉、已掃數平價售出無餘、</p>
<p>本月粉價</p>
<p>再査上年十二月間、因阜豐廠發粉包數减少、即以所抽十分之一之洋粉補充、故十二月份全月中、除星期日及十二月二十五日，三十一日·以外、凡經工部局核准之兩租界麵號用戶、每日可以領得核准之數、一包不缺、倘有未領到者、可向原指定之粉號照數補領也、至于木年一月份之粉價、工部局雖曾與廠方數度接洽、尙未確定辦法、因一方面須顧全廠商成本、使其原料之供給不斷、一方面須顧全用戶之負担、使粉價不致過高、故價格方面、尙未談妥、</p>

<p>現粉市况、頗形堅穩、因値塲、休假期屆、客銷雖非暢動而本街各店添備甚殷、且平賣粉已停止供給、各廠以原料缺乏、暫停出粉、俟國曆新年再定新辦法、故人心愈覺望好、統市售開花烏及鐘樓牌澳粉近萬包、價由二十二元五角七分至六角、在結束期前、均不願多售、且待新年開市、再行開做云</p>
<p>小麥市况、緊佾如常、良以產價步昂、運輸困難、在此到稀存薄聲中、又値國曆年終結束期屆、買賣愈擯愈僵、聞日廠進價暫不寬放、華廠則暫停吸收、故市面平靜逾恒、國曆年假休假三市、四日照常開業、</p>
<h3>油市　休假三日　油市先行掛大　油商投機心熱烈之一般</h3>
<p>昨爲國曆年終、新年將休假三天、四日照常上市、故雜糧市塲、竟然完全停頓、惟油市因投機心熱、且三天無市、故在午後將各油行情一致掛大近兩元、原因大連豆油期貨市面、在囤戶操縱下、猛跳三元半、致一般巧心思、預知開市必漲、所以有先行掛大、候財進門之舉、昨計做開膠州生油一百五十件、價爲八十九元至九十元零五角、又新貨二百件、價爲九十元至九十一元五角、靑島生油三十桶、價爲一百二十四元五角、又新貨五十桶、價爲一百二十五元、膠州豆油五十件、價爲八十元至八十一元、靑歧豆油五十件、價爲八十元、烟歧豆油五十件、價爲八十五元、靑島豆油二十桶、價爲一百零九元、大連豆油一百桶、價爲一百十五元五角、又訂期交一千餘桶、價分一月上爲一百十三元五角至一百十六元五角、一月下爲一百十五元、二月上爲一百十六元至一百十七元、及大有廠豆油三百担、價爲九十元至九十三元</p>

<h3>棉花廠胃淡薄</h3>
<p>現棉情况略帶疲狀、因紗價平庸、而廠方採辦意態殊爲澹泊、所以人心不堅、且在年頭年尾中、各方更無活動發展之望也、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、細約棉市、晨初即因投機者之購買而漲、續後再因國內原棉消耗之數字增加、及一部份同業之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲十餘磅音、印度連同預測跌四羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂異常、廠方購意淡薄、加之同業亦不願廉價出售、因之原棉交易無起色、然一般預料、俟渡過年關後、棉市將有起色也、</p>
<h3>棉布迭經挫折</h3>
<p>廠布昨市穩定、因已屆年終總結束期、市盤迭經挫折、人心淡薄、多數觀望、成交稀少、以待明年紅盤、再談交易、售盤呆定、均少更動、本街成交散額粗細布·斜紋·漂染布等二百餘件、浙路溫甬幫進大鵬·冨貴·細布怡和漂布·條漂布等貨近百件、粵港幫辦色布·漂布·粗細布等一百數十件、</p>

<h3>雜項　香烟派貨　不敷市銷</h3>
<p>香烟市况連日行情依舊緊俏、廠方派貨、不敷市銷、各物均趨上漲、故各方人心濃厚、執貨者不願脫手、都扳牢不買、致市價難以回落、昨如大英牌做一千三百八十五元、老刀牌九百八十五元、品海牌八百七十五元、五華牌六百七十五元、小仙女六百七十五元、華成公司美麗牌九百六十元、金鼠牌九百四十元、廠方封關三天、門市買價仍看高漲、</p>
<h3>火柴肥皂　同感缺乏</h3>
<p>火柴行情、連日漲風不息、因市上日見减少、向市塲購售、執貨者小數供給市銷、致市價飛黃騰達、昨如美麗牌每箱市售三百九十元、鳳凰牌三百八十五元、雜牌三百六十元左右、均較上週漲起三十餘元、</p>
<p>肥皂市價、買氣緊俏、因原料飛漲、廠方有小數派至同業應市、故致行情挺秀、固本皂每箱市售廿四元四角、祥茂皂每箱十八元八角、白祥茂每箱廿二元八角、（坤）</p>
<h3>五金　新盤元見挫　狹條鐵暢銷</h3>
<p>新盤元市况、前以外匯數度緊縮、行盤會一日間數易新價、最高行情喊至八十元大關、惟自前昨以來、因滙率放鬆、金市下挫、致同業人心亦未敢挺昂、於是新盤元開價亦遂見步挫、昨喊每担七十五六元、此前已落三四元不等、而賓交仍稀少、</p>
<p>美狹條鐵日來交易頗暢、因本街方面之數廠家、見馬口鐡會司鐵行情之高昂、紛紛改購狹條鐵、故市况殊覺熱鬧、實銷較之他貨殊蜀可觀、因而業此者心恩不弱、開價扳持甚堅持、昨市如二百磅統花色每自箱須一百二十元至三十元不等云、</p>

<p>綜觀右表、一二三月尙屬平平、六月以後、已至高峯、不料自九月份起、因某方嚴格統制、供給商用者更形减少、而操是業者、乘機囤積居奇、乃一漲再漲、而趨於白熱化、惟物極必返、乃一定之理、商人圖利、爲營業之通例、各水泥商以爲有利可圖、乃紛紛向洋商訂購外貨、期獲厚利、豈知孤島係彈丸之地、吃胃有限、水泥非米棉之類、能作持久囤積、自上月初先後到紅龍牌水泥二萬餘包、在去年歲底、又到印度水泥一萬五千包而紅龍牌已經裝船、在途者尙有二三萬包、消息傳來、以致市塲價一落千丈、兼之外匯下降、成本反而增高、非惟不能有利、抑且還須虧本、此種趨勢、並非出於始料、乃失於通盤籌劃耳、</p>

<h3>America Decides to Aid China with Materials, Supplying China with Important War Equipment</h3>
<p>Negotiations on Aircraft Purchase Underway Between Both Parties; Implementation to Commence Upon Congressional Approval</p>
<p>Washington – U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau declared that President Roosevelt intends to apply his plan of leasing armaments and military equipment to Britain, and also to China and Greece, stating that this plan can be applied to any country when the President deems it necessary. It has been noted that some members of Congress view the U.S. President's extensive leasing of military equipment plan as a step to circumvent the Johnson Act (which prohibits lending to any defaulting nation). Morgenthau stated that the implementation of this new plan would depend on Congressional approval, and Chinese officials stationed in Washington have already discussed with the U.S. Treasury Department methods for transporting fighter planes. The difficulty lies in the fact that the existing number of American aircraft is insufficient to supply them. Unofficial sources close to the President said that the United States deeply believes that China has been able to contain Japan and is therefore in a better position than Britain. Furthermore, the planes used by Japan are rarely new and high-altitude, and the gasoline used is also very poor, so planes that are considered obsolete in the United States can still be used by China. The U.S. Treasury Secretary also stated that the chairman of the British Purchasing Commission, Purvis, had met with the President at the White House to discuss and present Britain's needs. Purvis said, "The President's plan truly opens a new era in American policy. I will wait quietly for Congress's opinion." (31st All-American News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – In response to questions regarding the U.S. lending war equipment to Greece and China, U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that President Roosevelt's plan to lease war equipment could be applied to anyone, and the scope of application of this plan would depend on Congress. According to the original suggestion of the American President, it was "to lease military supplies to Britain if a situation arises where direct payment methods are no longer available." (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sino-British Loan Extended for Half a Year</h3>
<p>New York – Columbia Broadcasting Corporation and the National Broadcasting Company have recently reported hearing from the British Broadcasting Corporation that the British government has decided to extend the Sino-British short-term credit agreement for another six months in order to encourage China to use the British loan of £10 million to purchase British goods. (31st United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Malayan Federation – To Levy Income Tax</p>
<p>Singapore – It is currently believed here that the Straits Settlements and the Malayan Federation may implement an income tax due to a committee's proposal to levy a war tax on people's income. (31st United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Utilizing Flying Fortresses, Bombing Japan Becomes Possible</h3>
<p>New York "Herald Tribune" reported yesterday that Rear Admiral Towers, head of the Naval Aviation Technical Division, and other experts jointly requested massive aircraft assistance to China. The "Herald Tribune" published a Washington authoritative source stating that the United States will soon assist China with at least four hundred warplanes. Rear Admiral Towers stated that China's needs cannot be ignored, and four hundred is only the minimum quantity. The newspaper stated that Chinese officials currently in Washington are strongly advocating for China's need for new-style aircraft because Japan is using the new Messerschmitt fighter planes. The newspaper stated that the planes given to China will include six of the U.S. Army's famous "Boeing" "Flying Fortresses." The newspaper pointed out that this type of aircraft will enable China to take the offensive against Japan and conduct night raids. This news from the "Herald Tribune" was revealed after President Roosevelt's "fireside chat." In his speech, President Roosevelt praised China's "great defense" in the East and promised to do his best to aid China with materials. The current plan to supply aircraft to China has been delayed because Britain's need for aircraft is far more urgent than China's. What China wants is at least one hundred or four hundred fighter planes, plus a small number of long-range bombers. T.V. Soong has not yet signed the loan agreement for 100 million U.S. dollars with the Export-Import Bank because there are currently no ready-made goods such as aircraft available. Well-informed sources do not believe that the United States will hand over the latest aircraft to China, but they know that the U.S. Army has a batch of earlier-period Flying Fortresses, about seventeen, which can probably be given to China for use. This batch of large aircraft has now been replaced by newer models. This type of Flying Fortress can fly continuously for 3,000 miles at a time, carry two tons of bombs, and fly at 250 miles per hour. If China obtains this, it can bomb Japan every night. The relevant authorities stated that the U.S. Army's bombers are gradually being put aside for scrap and must be replaced with new models, so a part of the existing aircraft should be available for China to use. U.S. government officials and Chinese Ministry of Finance personnel have been negotiating the purchase of aircraft for a long time, but the entire plan has not yet been agreed upon.

<h3>President's Fireside Chat – A Powerful Warning to Japan</h3>
<p>Washington – Many government officials believed yesterday that President Roosevelt's fireside chat on Sunday night was an anti-Japanese message and also released a historic U.S. Far East policy. Federal Security Administrator McNutt told United Press reporters, "The speech is tantamount to warning Japan and the other two Axis countries that the United States is prepared to maintain the interests of democratic countries by military means." McNutt also praised the President's speech, calling it "completely brave and straightforward." Democratic Senator Sherman believed that Roosevelt's remarks about the Far East were quite important. He said, "The President announced to the world that the United States will not accept the philosophy of dictators in Asia, just as it will not accept the philosophy of dictators in Europe, the same stance." Political observers have focused on the President's words about the "Hawaiian Fleet," all believing that it is enough to create a deep impression. They believe that these words are tantamount to indicating that the U.S. fleet will remain stationed in Hawaii for a long time before the tense situation in the Far East is resolved. They also believe that it can be regarded as a warning that the U.S. fleet is prepared to resist any actions that infringe on U.S. interests. In his speech, the President placed Japan in the same position as Germany and Italy and solemnly declared that the Tripartite Pact is a threat to the United States. He also refused to accept Yosuke Matsuoka's assurance that the Axis alliance is not aimed at the United States. In addition, one thing worth noting is that Roosevelt condemned the so-called new order in both Europe and Asia with an attitude of condemnation. (31st United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington – People here expect Tokyo to repeatedly read, study, and ponder the U.S. President's remarks about the Eastern Axis in his "fireside chat." The fact that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's statement that if the United States does not change its foreign policy, which is opposed by Japan, then there will only be war, is not valued by the United States and cannot have the slightest impact. President Roosevelt has clearly stated this in his speech, and nothing can be added. There is a section in the President's speech, only one sentence, "Our fleet is in the Pacific." The President paused deliberately before and after this sentence, without adding other words, because the meaning of this sentence is extremely obvious and there is no need for redundant words. The President also clearly declared that he sees China's resistance to Japan as a part of the struggle of democratic countries against evil forces seeking world conquest and domination. The New York Times commented on Japan in an ironic tone, saying that Japan is trying its best to imitate Germany's behavior and wants to use Thailand like Hitler used the Sudetenland. But if it goes beyond Korea and the three northeastern provinces of China and incorporates them into Japan's territory, what will Thailand's awareness be? (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Yomiuri Shimbun criticized U.S. President Roosevelt's broadcast, saying that the U.S. President's policy is now driving the United States closer to war. The U.S. President's claim that he believes the Axis countries will eventually fail can be regarded as a completely irresponsible statement. Regardless of how the situation will be next year, the United States must bear half the responsibility. Official criticism of President Roosevelt's speech is still unknown, as Japan's official New Year holiday officially began on December 28, and government and administrative agencies will not resume work until January 4. However, after reviewing the opinions of the responsible parties, it can be found that well-informed Japanese people all believe that President Roosevelt has intentionally ignored and not heard Japan's repeated statements that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact is not directed at the United States and that Japan's "East Asian New Order" is not due to imperialist purposes. President Roosevelt's claim that the Axis countries' new order aims to enslave the world through an unholy alliance has reportedly caused particular dissatisfaction among Japanese people, who say that Japan's point of view has been restated by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in his speech at the welcoming ceremony for the new U.S. Ambassador Nomura at the Japan-America Association on December 19.

<h3>Smuggling of Japanese Goods Decreases in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region</h3>
<p>Zheng County – The economic war against Japan in North China is still in full swing. Since the establishment and strengthening of the organization of the Cargo Inspection Association of the Economic Committee of North China, the monthly leakage of 8 million yuan in Henan Province has gradually been stopped. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Inspection Association was established in May of this year. Seized cases are handled by three methods: confiscation, fines, and tax supplements. The main Japanese smuggled goods are textiles, cigarettes, and pigments, followed by stationery and sundries, with very few medical supplies and hardware. Due to the promotion of inspection work, the tax revenue of various tax authorities is booming, exceeding the past by several times. The reporter patrolled along the river and saw that the work in Zhengzhou, Luohe, Jieshou and other places was very tense. It is reported that the Japanese side has banned the inflow of British and American goods into the guerrilla areas in the interior of China. (30th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Welcoming 1941</h3>
<p>Today is New Year's Day, January 1, 1941, according to the Gregorian calendar. In China: tracing back to the ascension to the throne of the Yellow Emperor's Jiazi, it has been 4,638 years; creating the Republic, it is the 30th year of the Republic of China; beginning the great cause of resisting and rebuilding, it has been five years, and today is the fourth New Year's Day in hardship.</p>
<p>This year's New Year's Day will not only be celebrated because of the change of the year and welcomed with the removal of the old and the establishment of the new. Embracing hope is often a powerful encouragement and often a factor of success, but this year, we have grasped what we hope for. The dark night has indeed passed, and the dawn has begun to reveal a new atmosphere. Loyal and tempered people have jointly embarked on a glorious and bright future. This is not a prayer, but a clearly visible trend, a fact that can be expected and is just around the corner. Dear readers! The seven necessities of life are the same for every household, every day, but modern life has eight things; reading the newspaper is the first of the eight. The first thing reported to readers on the first day of this year is that this year is the year of victory, that is, the suffering and price paid over the past four or five years, and this year should be the harvest.</p>
<p>The world's turmoil began in the Far East with the September 18th Incident in 1931; like the spread of an epidemic, like the pushing of waves, like the penetration of water, like the spread of fire, day after day, place after place, the turmoil has become so vast and profound to the current situation; it is very likely that it will finally end in the Far East! Of course, either because China's planned general counter-offensive has reaped the scheduled achievements, or because the strengthening of international pressure has taken effect, or because the invaders' internal exhaustion has collapsed, causing the Far East situation to turn sharply downward and end earlier than elsewhere; this is within expectations and a reasonable step. But even if we don't think so and assume that the Far East will inevitably end later, since other places will inevitably be unable to withstand several decisive large-scale offensives in modern warfare and will not be difficult to end, the Far East will closely follow the end of other places and end. Let's review today before the large-scale offensive. On the side of the Allied Three: the apparent discord between them, the partial and ineffective cooperation, the frequent failure of their recent international plans, the irreparable remedy for their congenital poverty and acquired damage, and the fact that their essence of war is neither progress nor victory, but decline and failure, are all explained by facts. On the side opposing the alliance: China is advancing towards the final victory through self-reliance and foreign aid, Britain has overcome the crisis and turned to an advantage, and Greece is continuing its unexpected great victory; although the United States does not directly participate in the war, it has recently openly declared that its success or failure is consistent with that of China, Britain, and Greece, and is doing its utmost to help the three countries with its great and unparalleled national power to win victory; the three countries firmly insist on their determination to resist, and the United States also recognizes that it is engaged in a short-sighted attempt at peace. Comparing the two, China, Britain, and Greece will undoubtedly win. The allied countries will undoubtedly be defeated. They are destined to be defeated, but because it is difficult to get off the tiger, they still take risks in the hope of luck, and will soon try several decisive large-scale offensives, which is bound to happen. It is easy to imagine and does not prevent judgment: several decisive large-scale offensives will be between spring and summer this year, or even before summer, and it will be difficult to endure past autumn. Autumn is the natural harvest season!</p>
<p>Of course, who knows that you can't get something for nothing, you can't sit and wait for the harvest, and in the last moment before the harvest, you must shed the last blood and sweat. A year's plan lies in spring. How should we prepare for the exchange of the last blood and sweat this year, and how should we adapt to the arrival of the final victory? Under the belief of certain victory, while welcoming the New Year's Day of 1941, everyone is willing to solemnly and reverently accept this topic.</p>
<h3>This Year's Precious Gift</h3>
<p>The head of a country that has not yet directly participated in the war can righteously and sternly issue a speech like the one the day before yesterday, denouncing Germany, Italy, and Japan, and supporting China, Britain, and all anti-aggression countries. This is only possible for the United States, which finally suddenly participated in the European War at the end, and determined the victory of Britain and France in one fell swoop, and for the United States, which determined China's integrity with a "Open Door" declaration when the imperialist powers jointly conspired to divide China in the 19th century, to have such courage. Moreover, only Roosevelt, who has been re-elected as the head of state for three terms and is deeply supported by the American people, dares to represent 150 million American citizens and speak boldly. Observing the current and future situation of the international community, this speech has epoch-making significance!</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, in his speech, specifically clarified the plan to keep the United States from getting involved in the war, which is to do its best to help China and Britain defeat the Axis powers and Japan. In such assistance from the United States, of course, there is a crisis of direct conflict between itself and the three countries; Roosevelt must have estimated this crisis before resolutely making this final decision. Analytically speaking, he is doing his best to help China and Britain defeat the three countries with the determination to participate in the war, and still hopes that the United States can eventually avoid the pain of war. Comparing the advantages and disadvantages, Roosevelt's speech has been clearly pointed out. The signing of the Three-Power Alliance is the first step in threatening the United States; for the past three months, spokespersons at all levels in Germany, Italy, and Japan have repeatedly echoed each other and threatened the United States, which is the second step; and in the past few days, the German fleet, with Japan's cooperation, has begun to attack British ships in the Pacific. In this third step, the tentacles of war have indeed extended to the Pacific. Since the situation has forced the United States to approach the front line, the United States will not hesitate to fight, let alone help China and Britain. For this reason, after Roosevelt's speech, the plan for the United States to lend a large number of weapons to China was revealed far and wide. As detailed in the telegram, no further citations are needed. Although there is a considerable distance in space and time from the present to the establishment and implementation of the plan, the sincerity and real support for China that this shows has also become a precious gift that China is happy to accept.</p>
<h3>New Year's Day of the 30th Year of the Republic of China, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues a Letter to the Military and Civilians, Anti-Reconstruction Enters the Fifth Year, Preparing for More Heroic Efforts</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday issued a "Letter to the Military and Civilians of the Whole Country on the New Year's Day of the 30th Year of the Republic of China," which was several thousand words long and detailed the indivisibility of anti-reconstruction.

<p>Chongqing – Foreign Minister Wang hosted a banquet for the Burmese journalist delegation at noon on the 30th, with many government leaders accompanying. During the banquet, Wang delivered a speech, roughly saying that although the delegation's visit to Chongqing coincided with the fog season, the broken walls and rubble were visible everywhere, which proved the difficulties we encountered and the people's and government's determination to fight to the end. He then spoke of the geographical and historical relationship between China and Burma, and the intimacy of their friendship, discussed the opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road and its benefits to both parties, and finally said that China's spirit of fighting has become stronger and stronger over time, and hoped that the journalist delegation would convey this to the Burmese people. The deputy leader of the delegation, U Tun Tin, then gave a reply to express his gratitude. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Concentrate Near Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Here, many speculations have been aroused regarding the rumor that large numbers of Japanese troops are concentrated near Guangzhou. It is widely believed that since there are no signs of large-scale Japanese military operations in northern Guangdong at present, these troops may be concentrated to prepare for an attack on Hong Kong, and it is likely that they will first attack the Kowloon area. It is said that the Japanese attack on Hong Kong may coincide with the new Axis activities in Europe and the future Japanese attack on southern Vietnam. It is believed that the reopening of hostilities along the Thai border is of particular significance. Although the exact number of Japanese troops currently concentrated near Guangzhou is still unknown, it is reported that at least 50,000 Japanese troops have gathered there in the past two weeks. According to news from the former officials in Guangdong Province, it is estimated that the number of Japanese troops is between 70,000 and 80,000, but it is believed that the figure of 50,000 is more reliable.

<h3>Nazi Military Aid to Italy, Trenches Dug on Romanian Border</h3>
<p>Yugoslavia Feels Extremely Uneasy, German Army and Air Force Arrive in Italy from Austria</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – Travelers returning from the border yesterday stated that German troops entering Romania from Hungary in recent days have been digging trenches on the Romanian border and preparing defensive lines. According to travelers, German troops are preparing 15 miles outside the entire border of Romania. This news has caused considerable unease in Yugoslavia. German artillery positions are built at opposite locations on the South Country border. Travelers said that since December 6, 1 million to 3 million German troops have been arriving in Romania daily on 70 trains, carrying military supplies and troops through Hungary. Travelers arriving here from Slovenia reported that German "Junkers" aircraft fly from Germany to Italy in squadrons every day. (31st United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – According to responsible sources here, in addition to several German air force squadrons in Italy, there are also four German divisions. It is reported that three of them took the train through Vienna and arrived in the Italian ports of Venice and Sicily on December 15. The fourth division, mostly composed of Austrian soldiers, crossed the Corinthian Alps and entered Trieste. This division will likely be sent to Albania or North Africa. It is reported that a large squadron of Condor-type aircraft piloted by Germans has been sent to the airfield near Endini to aid Italy. Currently, railway transportation is constant every day, so Italy is gradually receiving supplies of aircraft parts, armaments, ammunition, small tanks, small gunboats, and submarines. The submarines are disassembled and transported by train to Monfalcone in the Gulf of Trieste for assembly. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome – Well-informed unofficial sources here predicted yesterday that "the most important action of the Axis countries" may occur around January 20, before and after President Roosevelt takes office. It is reported that the Axis countries have made various preparations for this large-scale move. Everything is almost ready in the Adriatic Sea and the Ionian Sea to launch… (The following content was deleted by the Italian government's press censorship office) (31st International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – It is reported that German troops are heading from Austria to France, which is related to the rumor that Germany will occupy the non-occupied zone of France. Düsseldorf and neighboring cities have gathered the most German troops. German troops are constantly heading to northern France from here. Recently, Germany has actively promoted internally that it will launch a general offensive against Britain in the early spring to end the war in favor of Germany. The purpose of this propaganda seems to be to encourage the morale of the German people, which is said to have greatly declined. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>One German Division Aids Italy in Combat, Greek Troops Advance Towards Valona</h3>
<p>Struga – Reliable sources report that an entire German division has arrived in Albania and is currently assisting the Italian army in combat in Elbasan and Librazhd. German engineering teams have also arrived in the middle of the Durrës to Berat highway. In addition, Greek troops reoccupied the village of Lin, capturing many Italian soldiers and armaments. (31st United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens – A Reuters correspondent accompanying the Greek army reported that Greek troops, departing from Himara, are advancing along the coastal road towards Valona, an important base for the Italian army, and are rapidly gaining an advantage in the Keraunian Mountains. They have now controlled both sides of Polican, and fierce fighting continues around Tepelena and Klimara. When this battle is successfully concluded, it will be seen what price the Italian troops guarding the high mountains overlooking these two important places will pay, and what the spirit of the Greek troops fighting for the high mountains is. Currently, the other important matters on the Albanian front are the Italian counter-attack north of Klimara, the Italian offensive actions in the mountains east of the Aulona ridge, and the gradual advance of the Italian troops from their positions on the shore of Lake Ohrid. All these actions prevent the right wing of the Greek troops approaching Elbasan from taking large-scale actions. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – The Athens non-fee radio station broadcast a bulletin from the Greek Information Office stating that the enemy's defensive positions west of Lograt have been captured by Greek troops. Despite the bad weather, the Greek troops are still achieving good results on all fronts. (31st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Foreign Minister Reaffirms Neutrality</h3>
<p>South Bulgaria Suddenly Adopts Anti-Soviet Policies; Soviet Military Attaché in Bulgaria Replaced</p>
<p>Sofia: During yesterday's parliamentary debate on the budget in Bulgaria, a former minister stated that the Bulgarian people have the right to request the government to clarify its foreign policy, as the people will defend Bulgaria with their property. Bulgarian Foreign Minister Popov replied that Bulgaria will not deviate from its clearly declared policy of strict neutrality, as there is no reason to change the policy of neutrality at present. Popov also mentioned the left-wing elements in Bulgaria advocating closer cooperation with the Soviet Union, saying that the Bulgarian government and parliament will not listen to the words of either the right or the left. Rumors are spreading that the staff of the Soviet embassy in Sofia will be changed soon. The newly appointed military attaché, Colonel Masarov, has recently arrived. Given the recent intensification of communist propaganda in Bulgaria, it is widely believed that there will be changes in the Soviet embassy staff. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Budapest: Yesterday, two Southeast European countries suddenly adopted anti-Soviet policies amidst the entry of German troops into the Balkans. This action was completely unexpected. The Soviet TASS news agency correspondent stationed in the capital of Southern Bulgaria was expelled by the Southern government on suspicion of espionage and given 24 hours to leave the country. The Southern government authorities also suppressed trade unions. A pro-neutrality Bulgarian newspaper published new and severe measures to deal with communist activities. Bulgarian police arrested a communist leader for staging a fierce demonstration demanding a military alliance with the Soviet Union. The Bulgarian government emphasized that since Bulgaria has refused to align itself with the Axis powers, it cannot sign a contradictory alliance with the Soviet Union. (International News Agency, 31st)</p>
<p>Sofia: Bulgarian Defense Minister Daskalov today issued a year-end statement, saying that the recovery of Southern Dobruja was the happiest event for Bulgaria this year. He continued by saying that the reputation and determination of the Bulgarian army allow the country's borders to be defended with a minimal number of troops. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt's Speech Enthusiastically Welcomed by All Sides, But Axis Powers Express Indignation; Hitler to Respond After Study</h3>
<p>Washington: White House Secretary O'Leary recently told reporters that the President's latest speech has received a more positive response than before, with support for the President's policies being 100 to 1. Therefore, the President is extremely pleased with this feedback. However, it is rumored that the Axis powers are very angry after hearing the speech, and that Hitler will respond. The President did not comment on this. Yesterday, after the President delivered his speech on aiding China and Britain, he immediately took action, inviting the Chairman of the British Purchasing Commission, Purvis, to a meeting at the White House. U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also attended. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>New York: "The New York Times" stated that the absolute majority of the American people unanimously agree with the key point in President Roosevelt's speech that "an Axis victory would create a terrible era." "The New York Bulletin" stated that this speech is the highest call for the people to rise up and take action. The President's purpose is to make the people aware of the truth of the situation. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>New York: President Roosevelt's speech on Sunday evening was warmly welcomed by Britain and several Balkan countries, while the Axis countries only expressed anger. When the London press listened to President Roosevelt's speech, German planes were bombing various parts of London, causing huge fires. The London press stated, "Our purpose has been forged into steel by the great fire in London." According to reports from Athens, all of Greece welcomed President Roosevelt's challenge to the Axis powers and predicted that the Axis powers would eventually fail. The press in the capital of Southern Bulgaria even set an unprecedented precedent by publishing President Roosevelt's speech, which the Axis powers hated, prominently in the newspaper. However, the press and unofficial sources in Budapest said that the speech was insincere and contained many contradictions. Roman newspapers deleted large portions of President Roosevelt's speech and published it on pages two and three in an insignificant position. The authoritative "Messaggero" did not publish a single word about Roosevelt's speech. Italian political circles generally said that this kind of third-country opposition to the Axis's position would not cause them to panic. "Il Popolo di Roma" recognized that the United States had become an ally of Britain. "Il Giornale d'Italia" editor-in-chief, Gaeta, wrote that Roosevelt had united with Britain and had launched an undeclared war against the Axis powers and Japan. "The Axis powers have been patient for a long time, but it must be known that the patience of the Axis powers is limited." As for the general public in Moscow, they have not yet learned of Roosevelt's speech through the press or radio. In Sofia, Bulgarian authorities said that the scope of President Roosevelt's speech was far beyond people's expectations. In Vichy, the Havas news agency disseminated a summary of President Roosevelt's speech at 4:00 PM, deleting everything in the speech that involved the Axis powers and Japan. The conclusion of the Havas telegram stated that the spirit of President Roosevelt's speech has far exceeded the usual limits and will inevitably arouse enthusiastic comments around the world. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Berlin: Unofficial but highly reliable sources in Germany now know that Hitler will directly respond to Roosevelt's speech within days. However, it is not yet clear whether his response will be in the form of a speech by Hitler himself or through someone authorized to speak on his behalf. Before the announcement of this declaration, the sources stated, "We are under orders not to express any opinions." It is known that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is personally studying Roosevelt's speech. Yesterday, Berlin newspapers not only did not publish Roosevelt's speech, but also did not publish any news about the U.S. President's upcoming speech. The major newspapers will criticize it after the German government responds. (Associated Press, 31st)</p>
<p>Rome: "Il Giornale d'Italia" stated that Roosevelt believes that the Americas are harmed by the Axis powers. In fact, the Axis powers have tolerated them to this day, but tolerance has its limits. This war aims to liberate Europe from British rule. Britain cannot win, and U.S. aid is just a futile waste and will only bring disaster upon itself. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>Hitler Issues New Year's Address to Soldiers; Army and Navy Leaders Offer Congratulations</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Head of State and Supreme Commander of the German Armed Forces, Hitler, recently issued a New Year's address to the German soldiers, stating, "German soldiers, the army of the National Socialist Party of Greater Germany has achieved glorious victories in 1940. The enemy has suffered major defeats on land, sea, and air. All achievements have been accomplished by the brave soldiers of each army. I am deeply moved. Your combat spirit has accomplished such great achievements in a matter of months, washing away the humiliation we suffered in the forest of Compiègne. It will be immortalized in history. I now, in my capacity as Supreme Commander and on behalf of the people of the entire country, thank you. We will commemorate the soldiers who sacrificed their lives for the country and the brave soldiers of Fascist Italy equally. At the beginning of this new year, I respectfully wish the army of the National Socialist Party of Greater Germany to accomplish the greatest victory in our country's history in 1941."</p>
<p>At the same time, the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force also issued New Year's greetings. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)</p>

Now that the end of the year has arrived, I am deeply concerned for all my comrades. However, I must first offer my best wishes for the New Year to those who are prisoners of war, those who are detained abroad for the country, and their families. I then offer my best wishes to those who are far away in overseas territories, defending the integrity of the empire, and those who are unable to return home for the holidays due to official duties. Finally, I offer my congratulations to all soldiers and their families in the country. I deeply hope that as a result of our efforts, the new France will achieve something." (Havas, 30th)</p>

<h3>German Planes Madly Attack Britain, London Suffers Terrible Devastation; Fires Still Burning, Walls and Ruins Everywhere; Many Famous Ancient Churches Damaged</h3>
<p>London: On Saturday night and Monday morning, the British Air Force bombed Frankfurt, and military targets in the area suffered heavy bombing. However, the results are unknown. (Associated Press, 31st)</p>
<p>London: On Sunday night, the city of London was heavily attacked by enemy planes, and dozens of houses caught fire and were completely destroyed. Yesterday, firefighters worked all day without stopping, clearing rubble and embers. It was found that there were no military targets within a mile of the bombed area. The major fires that broke out after the bombing were extinguished after an all-night effort, but some houses were completely burned inside, leaving only shells, which were still smoking and emitting sparks. In the worst affected areas, fire hoses crisscrossed the streets, winding through alleys and courtyards to reach areas where the residual fire was not completely extinguished, spraying water. The number of famous churches in the city of London that have been damaged has previously reached six, and now St. Anne's Church on Gresham Street, St. Agnes Church, and St. Mary's Church on Lombard Street have all been damaged. Another famous building, the Dr. Johnson Memorial Hall in Gough Square on Fleet Street (where Dr. Johnson compiled his famous English dictionary), was also set on fire by the bombing, but the chair that the doctor often sat in and valuable first editions of the dictionary were rescued. Other buildings such as the London Central Criminal Court, the City Hall, and the music school were also damaged. Houses in the Cheapside area were destroyed by fire, leaving only dangerous walls. The same was true of St. Bride's Church, where only the spire still towered high. The beautiful interior architecture of the church was the best in the city, but despite efforts to save it, it could not escape devastation. All the woodwork was reduced to ashes, and large pieces of glass were melted. The roof also collapsed, leaving only a pile of rubble. The City Hall auditorium also caught fire, and the roof was burned and collapsed. A fire broke out inside St. Mary's Church, and the embers were not extinguished. The above is part of the scene presented in London today after this severe night attack. The method used by the German planes in this attack was similar to the previous attack on Coventry, that is, first dropping incendiary bombs to start fires, and then using the firelight to find targets and drop high-explosive bombs. However, the German planes left before they could indiscriminately drop bombs, probably because the weather suddenly changed or because British fighter planes took off, and they did not dare to linger.

<h3>British Planes Attack Naples at Night; Customs Wharf Hit; Red Light Illuminates the Sky</h3>
<p>London: British bomber squadrons raided many military targets in German territory and various seaports and airfields in German-occupied areas on Sunday night. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<p>Cairo: Naples, Italy's largest port, was heavily bombed by British planes on Sunday night. British planes first dropped bombs on customs buildings and wharves, and then distributed leaflets. The leaflets contained Churchill's speech criticizing Mussolini for harming the country and the people. According to a British Air Force bulletin, when British planes flew away from Naples, they saw the west end of the customs wharf on fire, illuminating the sky in a red glow. The extent of the damage there could not be seen in detail due to weather conditions. All the planes that participated in the attack returned safely. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Churchill Inspects Disaster Area</h3>
<p>London: There were no German air raids anywhere in Britain last night. An Aviation Ministry bulletin simply stated "nothing to report." After the German planes bombed London on Sunday night, the British King sent a telegram to the city's mayor to express his condolences. Prime Minister Churchill also personally visited the bombed areas yesterday to inspect the damage. It is said that the damage suffered by the public halls was beyond general expectations. Six of London's oldest churches were either destroyed or heavily damaged. (Reuters, 31st)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Japanese Navy's Southern Advance Pending; U.S. Will Not Abandon Dutch East Indies; Willing to Use Force</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Rumors are rampant that the Japanese army will soon advance south or is preparing for a southern advance, but there is no factual proof. Concerned people have investigated this point and feel that the Japanese army has no such plan at present. There are currently 25,000 Japanese troops in Vietnam and 25,000 in Hainan Island. There has been no recent increase. According to military experts here, the Japanese navy is not preparing to advance south to seize the Dutch East Indies or Malaya, because if Japanese warships leave their territorial waters, they may be attacked by the U.S. fleet. According to reliable sources, if Japan launches a southern advance, the United States will go to war with Japan, because the United States wants to maintain the status quo in the Far East and wants to retain the resources of oil and rubber from the Dutch East Indies, because American synthetic rubber cannot replace natural rubber. The U.S. Navy believes that if the Japanese fleet remains within its territorial waters, like the Italian fleet, it will be difficult to attack and destroy. However, if it risks a southern advance, observers believe that the U.S. fleet can defeat it. Observers pointed out that west of Hawaii, the U.S. Navy has no good base, but it can use supply ships to supplement warships and oil tankers to form a temporary surface base for relief. It is widely believed that although Germany is trying to incite a U.S.-Japan war to prevent the United States from aiding Britain, the British victories in Albania and North Africa are also one of the reasons why Japan has been hesitant to advance. Observers said that Japan is not preparing to fight the U.S. now. (International News Agency, 31st)</p>
<h3>U.S. to Build Naval and Air Bases on British Islands; Preliminary Survey Completed; Locations Also Determined</h3>
<p>Washington: It is expected here that the U.S. Navy will soon begin construction of naval and air bases on the British territories leased from Britain. The locations for the bases to be built from Newfoundland to the British territories at the northern tip of South America have been determined, and the preliminary survey has also been completed. The locations of the bases to be built in each territory are listed below: (1) In Bermuda, Long Bird Island will be used as an airport, and St. David's Island will be used as a seaplane base, naval base, and garrison area. (2) In the Bahamas, Abrahams Bay and a small area of Mayaguana Island will be used as bases. (3) In Jamaica, Port Royal Bay, Goat Island, and nearby bays will be used to moor warships. (4) In Antigua, an area of Parham Sound and the Crabbes Peninsula east of Parham Harbour will be used as bases. (5) In St. Lucia, a seaplane base will be built on Gros Islet. (6) In British Guiana, an airfield will be built upstream of the Demerara River, and a seaplane base will be built near Suddie on the Essequibo River. (7) In Newfoundland, an airfield and army training camp will be established on the Argentia Peninsula, a naval base will be built in St. John's Harbour, and the army will be stationed and fortified north of Quidi Vidi Lake.

<h3>Rumors of German Peace Proposals to U.S.; State Department Does Not Deny; Formalities Not Worth Attention</h3>
<p>Washington: It is rumored that Germany made a peace proposal in October of this year, requesting President Roosevelt to act as a mediator. Yesterday, Marshall, chairman of the America First Committee, questioned the State Department, demanding that the U.S. release the proposal it received. The State Department did not deny that the peace proposal had been made, but said that regarding these formalities, there was "nothing" worthy of attention. Marshall said that the proposal was submitted to the government by New York oil magnate Davis. The State Department responded, "The government can only handle important international events through legitimate and responsible agencies." (International News Agency, 31st)</p>

<h3>New Year's Greetings and Looking Back at Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>On this commemorative founding anniversary of the Republic of China, while looking forward to the future, looking back at Shanghai fills me with boundless excitement:</p>
<p>First, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the Republic of China. In ancient times, people regarded thirty years as one generation, and they attached great importance to the number "thirty." The growth of an individual is indeed similar to the development of a country. Confucius said: "At fifteen, I set my heart on learning; at thirty, I stood firm." In this word "firm," He Yan's Collected Explanations says that it means "having something established," and Zhu Xi's Commentary says that it means "having something to stand on one's own." The general meaning is the same. A person in society should truly "have something to stand on one's own" when they reach the age of thirty. The same is true for a country. Confucius said, "If there is a king, he must have a generation before benevolence is achieved." This means that "if there is one who receives the mandate of heaven and rules the world, it will take thirty years before benevolent government is achieved." The so-called "at thirty, stood firm," and the so-called "must have a generation before benevolence," these all coincide with the meaning that we must complete the policy of national construction in this year, the 30th anniversary of the Republic of China. What we call the policy of national construction would be simply called "building the government" in ancient times. Completing the policy of national construction is what the ancients hoped for: benevolence after a generation. Only by completing the policy of national construction can our country stand on its own in the international community. On this New Year's Day of our thirtieth year, everyone should encourage themselves with this in mind.</p>
<p>Second, I have studied and worked in Shanghai for more than twenty years. Shanghai is truly my second hometown. I returned to Shanghai once in the autumn of the year before last. The dire environment of Shanghai was what I saw with my own eyes and experienced personally. The perseverance and hard struggle of the Shanghai compatriots, gritting their teeth and struggling to overcome the difficulties, was what I saw with my own eyes and what I admired most from the bottom of my heart. This was still the situation a year ago. I imagine that the current environment is even worse than it was a year ago, and the spirit of perseverance and hard struggle of our compatriots is certainly even more admirable than it was a year ago. Although my body is in the provisional capital, my eyes are always looking back at Shanghai, and our hearts are always concerned about the hard struggle of our compatriots and friends in Shanghai. I should take this auspicious occasion of the National Day to express my personal concern and admiration.</p>
<p>Third, although the past environment in Shanghai was dire, it will likely become even more difficult in the coming months. Although all commercial interests of third countries in Shanghai will be hit in the future, at the same time, the economic lives of five million citizens will also feel the threat. However, the foundation of Chinese legal tender is solid and cannot be shaken by any attempt. I sincerely hope that the Shanghai compatriots can take the overall situation into consideration, endure the pain of one corner and one moment, and remember the saying that after suffering comes sweetness.</p>
<p>Fourth, China has now reached the 30th year and has indeed reached the period of "at thirty, stood firm" and should have something established. After three and a half years of struggle, we have already reaped satisfactory results. In the current European situation, although it is a war in another region and another camp, and the evolution of the events has its own internal and international contradictions and fundamental factors, the awakening of ambition has not been inspired by the Far East. Since the signing of the Tripartite Pact, the two major wars in the East and West have merged in form. Although Japan's attempt to advance south is preparing step by step, in reality, it is still hesitating. The reason for this is, on the one hand, due to the strong attitude of the United States, but the continued fighting of China is the main determining force. Because of this, the increasingly powerful China has become the true stabilizing force in the Far East and has won international sympathy and assistance. The loan of 100 million US dollars from the United States and 10 million pounds from the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union's statement by Ambassador Smetanin in Japan that "there is still no change in the policy towards China," and the signing of a new trade agreement with China, all of this is not accidental, but the result of our resolute struggle.</p>
<p>Now we are stepping into the great 30th year of the Republic of China, and the history of national resistance has opened a new page. Whether in the military, political, or diplomatic aspects, we are clearly in a proactive position. The freedom and independence of China is related to the survival and happiness of our nation for thousands of years to come, and at the same time, it is also related to the reconstruction of world peace and human civilization. Our responsibility is exceptionally great, and our current work is particularly difficult. At this moment before the arrival of national liberation, all compatriots across the country must recognize that individuals only have freedom when the nation has freedom, and that the interests of the country are higher than private interests. They must also endure pain, have firm faith, and work together under the grand goal of resisting and building, to complete the mission of national liberation.</p>
<p>On this auspicious day of the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China, looking forward to the future and looking back at Shanghai, I am filled with boundless excitement. Therefore, I honestly and frankly list the above four points as a token of my admiration and blessings for the New Year. I also hope that everyone will do their best to overcome the difficulties, break away from the predicament, and regain the light. The day is not far off.</p>

<p>Washington: The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced yesterday that although wheat production in Manchuria, China, and Japan was higher than last year, there is now a panic over a wheat shortage. The U.S. Department of Agriculture explained that the reasons for the wheat shortage are the interference of officials in transferring wheat from surplus areas to areas with poor harvests, the disruption of transportation, and the gradual increase in the replacement of rice with wheat. The news also stated that under the current circumstances, it seems impossible to import large quantities of foreign wheat. (International News Agency, 31st)</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Reports on the State of Governance Over the Past Year - This Year Will Be the Year of Victory in Resistance and Construction</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The Central Government held the last weekly memorial service of the year on the 30th morning, where Vice President Kong attended and reported on the state of governance over the past year. The main points are recorded as follows: Chairman, comrades, today is the last weekly memorial service for Premier Sun Yat-sen in the 29th year of the Republic of China. I am here to report on my duties. I would like to take this opportunity of the changing year to report on some important matters of our resistance and construction in the past year, as a reference for learning from the past and looking to the future. I ask all comrades to give guidance. The past year has been the most breathtaking year in human history and a turning point in the safety and well-being of our Chinese nation. International winds and clouds have changed, like the transformation of the sea. On this day last year, many countries that enjoyed peace and happiness are now suffering the most tragic encounters of mankind. All old international order, political ideals, economic construction, and even people's thoughts, beliefs, and lifestyles are under serious threat and may be forcibly changed. Some small countries in Europe, who usually lived in peace with their neighbors, with their countries bustling with people and peaceful, are now being conquered. The conspiracy and hatred of those who would destroy countries are truly chilling. In this turbulent storm, our Chinese nation, fortunately, relied on the spirit of the Premier in heaven, secret blessings, and the leadership of the leader, and the cooperation of the whole country, to finally turn danger into safety, turn defeat into victory, break through numerous difficulties, and lay the foundation for victory. Compared with the current situation of resistance and construction and the situation on this day last year, we have made significant progress and have definite confidence in military, diplomatic, political, economic, and financial terms. According to the current situation, the 30th year of the Republic of China will be the year when the War of Resistance will be closer to victory, which is undoubtedly certain.</p>
<p>In the military, stability has been maintained throughout the year. Although there were slight advances and retreats in the Battle of Central Hubei, the scope of the Japanese activities could not escape our army's control. The great victory in Northern Hubei last month allowed the remaining Japanese forces in Yisha to fall into a dangerous situation. The unprecedented victory in Suiyuan and the repeated annihilation of Japanese troops in Southern Shanxi showed that the Japanese had exhausted all their efforts to invade Southern Guangxi last year, but eventually withdrew in October of this year due to our severe pressure. The gains and losses show the Japanese army's weakness and their awkward state of being unable to attend to both ends. This is very different from the situation at the beginning of the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In terms of diplomacy, the most memorable thing for us is the closure and opening of the Southwest International Transportation Route, the establishment of the alliance between the three countries, and the signing of the Japan-German-Italy Pact. Although the process of these events was very tortuous, the final evolution has finally brought us great benefits. The German blitzkrieg crushed France and Poland and occupied the Netherlands and Belgium. In a few months, most of Europe changed dramatically. The British Isles were under heavy threat. The Japanese took this opportunity to use tricks to lure various countries, "hoping to achieve their goal of taking advantage of the situation." Our government has always adhered to a firm stance and responded to any incidents. Unexpected pressure is not enough to affect our national policy of resistance and construction. However, the possible development of the international situation at that time was indeed the focus of national anxiety. The transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road was announced to be closed in this dim atmosphere. The depression in the spirit of the people was also unavoidable. It was not until the announcement of the establishment of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance that peace-loving people all over the world realized the endless ambition of the Japanese and knew that our War of Resistance had a significant contribution to the overall situation in East Asia and world peace. Therefore, international public opinion changed overnight. The Yunnan-Burma Road was reopened. British and American loans to us were successively established. The military supplies that the Japanese relied on from the United States were repeatedly restricted from being exported. This urgent change was like seeing the sun through the clouds, making the light of justice reappear in the international community. The alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan and the pact signed by the Japanese were regarded by the Japanese as the supreme treasure, but in fact, they were counterproductive and accelerated their collapse. Right and wrong, smoothness and adversity are very clear. The future of China's War of Resistance has been given a more favorable situation.</p>
<p>In terms of general administration, the government is promoting resistance and construction simultaneously. The gradual implementation of the new county system is the foundation for completing the national revolution in the past year in internal affairs. In order to establish a long-term foundation for national governance and security, the central government has provided subsidies to promote the realization of the new county system and has allocated 30% of the stamp tax revenue for local application. Furthermore, in view of the improvement of national education levels and economic life, for the long-term plan of national construction, we have made continuous efforts to promote production in the rear and popularize national education. In the spring and summer of this year, the Executive Yuan organized a political inspection team, selecting senior officials to go to various provinces to investigate the situation of governance and visit the hardships of the people. Summarizing the results of the inspection, during the War of Resistance, the general local politics of various provinces have improved. This has a positive impact on stabilizing the rear and promoting construction. It can also be seen that the opportunity for national restoration and construction has also been initiated with the war.</p>
<p>Economic warfare is the main factor determining the victory or defeat of the War of Resistance and is the focus of attention of the people of the country. It is true that the longer the war lasts, the more important the economic issues become. This is a very common and natural trend in modern warfare. However, some people do not understand this principle, and because they see that from the president to the government officials at all levels, they are paying attention to this issue, they think that there is some special crisis in the current economic situation of our country, and they misunderstand each other, causing a kind of psychological panic. This is because they do not understand the basic principles of modern warfare and its natural trends. We do not deny that China currently has an important economic problem that needs to be resolved with the greatest determination and perseverance. However, this does not mean that our economic society is now encountering a serious crisis. This is something that the people of the country must deeply understand.</p>
<p>Among the current economic problems, commodity prices occupy the core of the problem. If there are some people who do not understand modern economics, they will have various questions and speculate in surprise. They do not know that commodity prices have always occupied a central position in modern economics, especially during wartime. The government and the people have recently used all their strength to solve the price problem for this reason. If the price problem is grasped, other problems can also be solved easily. This is something that people with modern economic common sense can certainly understand and can no longer be repeated. However, modern economic problems are very complex and have related relationships with all aspects of the entire society. This also means that the price problem is not a simple problem, and it is even more difficult to solve it with a simple formula. We need to plan comprehensively on the one hand, taking into account all the factors, and on the other hand, we must assess the current financial and human resources situation, make appropriate arrangements, distinguish priorities, and proceed step by step, and at the moment, military and diplomatic affairs cannot be affected in the slightest. Otherwise, the entire War of Resistance will be affected. In the past few years, the government has been working hard in accordance with this policy, and it has been even more active in the past six months. In order to enable the economic institutions to operate flexibly and connect with each other, the Executive Yuan has recently established an Economic Conference, which meets once a week, and holds a meeting report once a month. It has also established a Department of Material Supervision in the Executive Yuan in accordance with the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee, which is responsible for economic and administrative affairs during the War of Resistance, so that the strength is concentrated and the power is unified. It is hoped that it will be formally established soon. In the past few months, because of the high prices of grain, which has greatly affected the people's lives, a National Grain Administration has been established in the Executive Yuan to control the country's grain. Grain management agencies have also been added to the provincial and county governments, using the power of the government to seek reasonable production and sales of grain in order to stabilize its price. The competent authorities are also seeking fair prices for other necessities of life in order to enrich the people's livelihood. These are the facilities in the political institutions in recent years. Concrete measures to address the grain problem have now been set and distributed to the country for implementation. Among the short-term measures, the most important thing is to strive for smooth grain sources, and to prevent counties from blocking grain exports and absorbing surplus grain from various places to supply the market, in order to achieve smooth flow of goods. The long-term solution is to increase production, dredge the source, and restrict people from storing more surplus grain based on the production and consumption of various places, and strictly crack down on hoarding of essential goods. On the one hand, they are punished according to law, and on the other hand, they adopt the policy of simultaneous price parity of grain prices, commodity prices, and labor prices, and regular price suppression. The government also allocates huge sums of money to purchase and transport separately for sale at parity prices to supply the market. Since the implementation of these measures, considerable results have been received. When the long-term solution is implemented smoothly, the price problem can be gradually solved.

<h3>The Whole City Celebrates Joyfully, Welcoming the New Year of Victory, The New Year and New Hopes Arrive Simultaneously, Supporting the National Policy of Resistance and Construction with Increased Faith</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China and also the New Year's Day of the 30th year. All sectors of the city decided to follow the central government's order not to hold extravagant celebrations because it is an extraordinary time and the national crisis is still in progress. Commemorative ceremonies were held separately. All agencies, organizations, schools, and companies are closed for three days. The authorities of the two concessions implemented ordinary precautions for three days to ensure safety. The Shanghai Chinese National Unity Alliance issued a letter to all citizens of the city on New Year's Day of the 30th year. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Completing the Great Cause is in This Year</p>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 30th year of our Republic of China. With the beginning of this 30th year, our Chinese nation is embarking on a bright road. Confucius said, "At thirty, I stood firm," which is exactly the symbol of the revival of our Chinese nation. The lessons that history has shown us cannot be forgotten. In the past hundred years, the wounds and shackles suffered by our nation have been too much accumulated. Not only have we lost our national spirit, but we have also lost our freedom and peace. However, the sound of the artillery of the July 7th Incident awakened the soul of our Chinese nation, and with the irrigation of fresh red blood, the vitality of our national revival has also grown and developed. The New Year brings new hopes. We have new strength, fully prepared, waiting for the opportunity to strive forward and restore our homeland. Therefore, this year is the year of victory. This is the new hope of the New Year. We must all be prepared to welcome the arrival of this year of new hope. Dear compatriots, our more than three years of depression on the isolated island is something we should be proud of. In order to complete the great cause of national resistance and construction, and to seek national freedom and equality, we have built a mountain of nine ren. In the future, we should bite our teeth, and go further on the hundred-foot pole, that is, to complete our greatest task and realize our new hopes.</p>
<p>Hanging Flags to Celebrate, Enthusiasm</p>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 30th year, which is also the year of victory in the general counter-offensive. Although all sectors of the city are in a special environment, they are enthusiastically hanging flags to celebrate this New Year's Day of great significance, and are even more determined to adhere to the belief in resistance and construction, support the national policy of resistance and construction, and actively promote the movement of thrift and construction to save the disaster and the movement of conscience contribution, in order to welcome the early arrival of the year of victory, so that the great cause of national construction and revival can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Tells American Friends: Victory is Coming Soon; Rapid Progress Achieved in Western China; Transformed Anew Amidst Painful Hardship</h3>
<p>1941 is China's year of victory. Our country has been fighting with all its strength for more than three years, and now the international situation is becoming increasingly favorable, and the nation's future is becoming brighter. At the beginning of this new year, boundless hope suddenly arises. The people of the isolated islands should take this as a starting point for vigorous self-reflection. While extending celebrations together, they should strengthen their determination to serve the country. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Song Meiling, recently wrote to her American friends, describing the growth and development of our country in difficult circumstances. Her vivid descriptions serve as a profound warning to us. The translation of her original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Free China Actively Engaged in Construction</p>
<p>The old year has passed and the new year has come. Although the situation we are in is quite dire, we have achieved great victories in the midst of difficulties. Because China has transformed anew in the midst of suffering. It is undeniable that the morale of the people is high and that their will is firm and difficult to shake. Without witnessing the perseverance of the people of Free China and observing the rapid progress of Western China, one cannot have a correct estimate of China's fighting power. In this vast area, a new China is being actively built. The development of industry and practical efforts keep China alive, vigorous, hopeful, and resolutely determined. All of this is amazing.</p>
<p>Extraordinary Spirit, Vibrant Vitality</p>
<p>However, not only this, but the strong character of the Chinese people, the diligence of individuals, and the manifestation of extraordinary spirit give China a vibrant vitality. Their calm attitude, appropriate management, and strong confidence are also inspiring and uplifting. The great changes in Western China are hard to imagine. Roads connect various places, making transportation extremely convenient. The construction of railways is advancing rapidly. This is not only conducive to the import of foreign raw materials and military supplies, but also eliminates jealousy and separation between some remote provinces in the Southwest, leading to cooperation. With such integration of provinces, increased administrative efficiency, peace, and tranquility, progress will inevitably be astonishing.</p>
<p>The Giant Wheel of Industry Moves Forward Unceasingly</p>
<p>The promotion of the New Life Movement encourages people to strive to be valuable citizens, improve family environments, trust and help each other, and pay attention to hygiene. Women's industrial cooperatives are also established everywhere, all working diligently to improve individuals and promote the progress and prosperity of the country. In addition to rural industries that have arisen due to the encouragement of cooperative undertakings by the New Life Movement, large-scale industrial cooperation movements are also being actively promoted. This will surely drive the giant wheel of industry, making it move forward unceasingly. Workers everywhere cooperate enthusiastically. Cooperatives spring up like mushrooms after rain, being established in Free China and spreading to other places. Their products are mostly made from local raw materials and sell well with great demand.</p>
<p>Women Everywhere Mobilized in Unison</p>
<p>They are fully utilized in coal mining, gold refining, shipbuilding, leather making, weaving, sugar refining, vehicle manufacturing, soap making, and food production, machine factories, iron smelting plants, and lumber yards, etc. Women everywhere are also mobilized to go to the front and rear, serving the military and civilians, teaching the people to reform bad habits, implement the New Life Movement and new ideas, with the aim of improving the situation in various rural areas. Their enthusiasm for work is quite remarkable. In short, the day of our country's victory is not far off, but the responsibility is even more arduous than before. We should do our best to promote the construction of Free China and mobilize the vast and boundless manpower of the whole country. Regardless of East, West, North, or South, regardless of men, women, old, or young, we should work together to achieve independence and liberation.</p>
<h3>Female Writer Visits Shanghai: Soviet Aid to China is Determined and Unwavering; Harmonious Relations Among Authorities in the Capital</h3>
<p>American writer Ms. Snow, author of numerous works on China and the Soviet Union, most of which are best-selling books in the United States, has a strong reputation. Recently returned to the US after travels to the Soviet Union and Chongqing, she passed through Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Coolidge at 2:00 AM today. When she will return to China is unknown, but Ms. Snow indicated to friends that she was reluctant to leave. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Ms. Snow at her residence yesterday. According to her, the Soviet Union is determined to continue aiding China and will not sign any treaties with Japan. When Ms. Snow was in Chongqing, she spoke with General Chiang Kai-shek, General Bai Chongxi, and CCP leader Zhou Enlai. She deeply feels that the Chinese communists all support General Chiang Kai-shek. When Ms. Snow discussed rumors of conflict between the Nationalists and Communists, she said that this matter arose because the Eighth Route Army and Fourth Route Army were ordered to be transferred north of the Yellow River, but she insisted that the leaders of both parties she met in the capital believed that this matter would be resolved satisfactorily. Ms. Snow said that she stayed in the capital for three weeks and deeply understands that the spirit of cooperation among the Nationalist and Communist leaders cannot be alienated by rumors and conspiracies.</p>
<h3>Group Leader Xie of the Lone Army Camp Encourages Youth</h3>
<p>Xie Jinyuan, the leader of the lone army camp, issued a letter to the youth of the isolated island for the new year, encouraging the youth to strengthen our confidence in "certain victory" and "certain success," hold our heads high, stride forward, firmly stand our ground with resolute will, and, at any time and place, directly or indirectly, for the country and the nation, be down-to-earth, pragmatic, and do as much as we can with our strength, save every penny, and increase the country's strength by one point. Currently, the first to donate money are overseas Chinese, even a coolie, a cart driver, each person can donate their daily wages regularly on a monthly basis and send them back to their motherland continuously. This kind of example of serving the country can serve as a model for us to glorify our ancestors. We must understand that our strength lies in the extensive and subtle exertion of effort. This most basic, most practical, and easiest patriotic movement should not be taken lightly or considered too troublesome because the matter is trivial, or started but not finished. Young people, with a firm belief in "certain victory" and "certain success," move forward together on the great and bright path to national rejuvenation. Arise, everyone, and shoulder the sacred task that cannot be shirked, and jointly follow the leader's New Year's Day message: "The military and civilians of the whole country work together to welcome our year of victory."</p>
<h3>Beggar Shelter Begins Admitting; Must Be Sent by the Bureau; Others Not Accepted</h3>
<p>The beggar shelter entrusted by the Public Works Department and Rotary Club to the Salvation Army has now been fully completed. The Salvation Army held an opening ceremony at the shelter on Hart Road and Singapore Road at 2:30 PM yesterday. Over a hundred people, including officials from the British and American consulates and the Public Works Department, attended. The district chief, Ma Ruishan, gave a speech, Pastor Ba Waner prayed, and the chairman of the Public Works Department, Kai Ziwei, presided over the flag-raising ceremony and gave a speech. Afterwards, Ma Ruishan led a tour, and the mood was quite enthusiastic. The shelter is scheduled to start admitting people today, fifty people per day, and will be able to accommodate them all within a month. The beggars to be accommodated must be sent by the Public Works Department. Those introduced by others or those who come on their own will not be accepted, in order to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>What Should the People of Shanghai Do?</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Fu</p>
<p>On the eve of a major historical transformation, in today's exchange of Far Eastern war and European turmoil, the importance of our country's sacred task of resistance and construction is becoming increasingly clear. Because our fighting is not only for our own independence and survival, but also for world peace and justice. Although its goal is to seek liberation for ourselves, its results affect the future of mankind.</p>
<p>For the past three and a half years, our strength has grown stronger as we fight. Militarily, politically, and diplomatically, we are in an active position with a leaping posture. The political offensive of the other side has been shattered by our great national spirit, and military aggression has also fallen into a fragile and powerless state on the verge of collapse. Diplomatic and economic situations are even more thorny, like a fire consuming itself. In a situation where they are at a loss, they have to use the Wang Jingwei conditions to carry out self-anesthesia, and use it to perfunctorily deal with the domestic masses. The objective situation has proven that our country has the hope of light, while the other side is declining like the setting sun.</p>
<p>The New Year's Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China is undoubtedly the revelation of the dawn of final victory. This year will be a new stage for us to launch a general counter-offensive and obtain national freedom and independence. However, in the occupied areas, especially on the misty and confusing isolated island, the moment before the light must be more difficult, darker, and more dangerous. As long as we can firmly believe in resistance and construction, endure temporary pain, and break through the darkness, the road ahead will be the road to happiness.</p>
<p>It must be known that they are trying to attack our military strength, and at the same time, they are also trying to attack our revolutionary spirit. If our spirit cannot be invigorated and our will cannot be concentrated, then wartime life will inevitably fall into being content with the status quo or being selfish and self-serving, or even falling into a pre-set trap. As the saying goes, "Once a chain is put on, it cannot be untied for hundreds of generations. Once the spirit is subdued, it will sink into eternal damnation." This is what the Chinese masses should be vigilant about in welcoming the year of victory.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we should practice at present is:</p>
<p>First, production and construction are an important part of national economic construction, and also a major prerequisite for enriching combat strength. Due to the increase in population during the war in this city, the influx of idle capital, and the dangerous environment, legitimate businesses cannot develop. As a result, speculators take advantage of it to hunt for illegitimate profits. Illegally engaging in private interests is no different from assisting Japan. Hoarding and manipulating prices often affect people's livelihoods, ignore the survival of the country, and seek personal greed. Even if conscience does not blame them, national law will ultimately not tolerate them. Moreover, the crisis on the isolated island is just beginning to develop. Instead of waiting for immeasurable losses, it is better to move capital to the mainland, engage in production and construction, so as to achieve a state where there are no wasted people, wasted time, wasted land, and wasted materials, and promote the rapid arrival of final victory.</p>
<p>Second, schools are the gardens for cultivating revolutionary youth, and at the same time, they are the fortresses for developing Chinese culture. The responsibilities of the education sector are more important than those of other sectors, and it is more difficult to cope with the harsh environment than others. However, since we have a deep understanding of righteousness in favorable and adverse situations, and we have a firm belief in the national policy of resisting aggression and building the country, we will not be shaken by threats, inducements, or slight setbacks. The education sector must not only be loyal and unwavering to the country and the nation and have a clear conscience, but also actively shoulder the mission of saving and building the country. Even if it is subjected to the oppression of dark forces and cannot maintain the status quo, it should insist on the spirit of non-compromise and fight to the end. The youth of the city will surely follow the teachers to eradicate the spread of toxic education. Moreover, the relevant authorities are already planning remedial measures and will not ignore the lives of colleagues in the education sector.</p>
<p>Third, last year, due to the tightening of control and the hoarding and profiteering of unscrupulous merchants, prices were high and life was increasingly difficult. As a result, labor disputes arose one after another and were particularly serious. The reason for this is mostly driven by livelihood issues, but there are also traces of villains taking advantage of the situation to incite trouble, hoping to generate a political offensive. We deeply hope that at this moment before dawn, we should promote the spirit of labor-management mutual assistance. The capital side must find ways to improve the lives of workers in the face of rising prices, and at the same time, the labor side should not resort to strikes as a last resort in order to overcome this final difficulty. It must be known that the current difficulties and hardships are caused by the forces of aggression. Only when China gains true freedom and independence will the day come for our compatriots in this city to be reborn. Otherwise, both labor and management will perish due to the increasingly dangerous environment. This is something that must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>The above three points are the minimum hopes for this New Year's Day and the necessary conditions for striving for national liberation. After three and a half years of hard fighting and the recent development of the situation, China is confident that it will win the final victory, and the day of victory is not far off. The key to victory is now in the hands of every compatriot.</p>
<h3>The "District Chief" of Sijing Town Tramples on the Local People</h3>
<p>Cao Jiancai, the "district chief" of Sijing Town, was imprisoned for forging documents before the National Army withdrew to the west. When the area fell, he was released with the crowd. In March of this year, he was appointed as the "district chief" of Sijing during the tenure of the former "Songjiang County Chief" Zhang Shouzhi. After taking office, he increased the arbitrary taxes and levies by more than threefold. It is said that more than 4,000 yuan for the construction of streets was embezzled, which is truly shocking.</p>
<h3>After External Negotiations Regarding Goods Held Up in Vietnam, the Vietnamese Governor Has Agreed Not to Auction Them; Negotiations on Returning Them to Shanghai and Hong Kong are Underway</h3>
<p>Regarding the goods of Chinese merchants in Shanghai, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou that were transported via the joint transportation system but were held up in Vietnam, after the Vietnamese governor ordered that they not be allowed to be returned to Hong Kong and Shanghai, and proposed to auction them, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various industries cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to fight for their release, and sent representative Jiang Chengdong to Saigon to negotiate with the Vietnamese governor for their release. Now that representative Jiang has returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with representative Jiang yesterday. The Vietnamese governor had ordered that the goods of Chinese merchants held up in Vietnam be auctioned, but the money from the auction would still be returned to the owners. After protests from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and efforts by the owners, the Vietnamese governor has agreed not to auction them. However, negotiations on returning them to Hong Kong and Shanghai are underway. The owners have joined forces with the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and other organizations to demand their release.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Files Definitely Moved; Total of Twelve Boxes</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that on Sunday evening (the 29th), twelve boxes of files from the Shanghai Municipal Government's Public Works Department at No. 172 Qiqi Road had been taken away by the Japanese and would probably be handed over to the "Municipal Government." An official of the French Concession police did not confirm or deny this, only saying that he had also heard that there was a dispute at the intersection of Qiqi Road and Fuli Road at 7:00 PM on Sunday afternoon. According to a Chinese report, the French police sent officers to the scene, but it was too late. The Japanese had already loaded the wooden boxes onto a car and driven away.</p>
<h3>Xue Gengxin Has Been Promoted to Chief Inspector</h3>
<p>Xue Gengxin, inspector of the French Concession police's political department, and translator Zou Chengding are deeply valued by the police department authorities for their diligence and outstanding work. It is learned that Xue has now been promoted to chief inspector, and Zou has been promoted to second-class inspector.</p>
<h3>Pudong Mercenaries Ding and Xu Clash; Ferry Service Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Pudong mercenaries are fighting among themselves for territory, resulting in the suspension of ferry service from Puxi to Donggou and Gaoqiao yesterday morning. There are two people, Ding Xishan and Xu Hongfa, who, when the National Army withdrew to the west, acted as bandits in the name of guerrilla teams in Nanhui, Chuansha, and Fengxian in Pudong. Ding and Xu were then reorganized. Ding's force had about 3,000 people, and Xu's force had about 1,000 people, occupying the area under the jurisdiction of Chuansha County. Recently, Ding's force planned to annex Xu's force, but Xu's force refused, and disputes arose. Suddenly, the day before yesterday morning (the 30th) at dawn, Ding's force, in conjunction with the "police brigade," surrounded Xu's force in the Tangmu Bridge area of Chuansha County and carried out disarmament. The two sides immediately clashed, with dense gunfire from rifles and machine guns. The nearby people were greatly alarmed and fled in droves. The two sides were deadlocked for a day and night, and had not stopped as of yesterday morning, and the situation became more and more serious. The Japanese side then sent troops to the Gaoqiao Donggou area to defend, but did not interfere in the conflict between the two sides. Yesterday morning, in order to mobilize troops, the Japanese side completely requisitioned the ferries traveling between Shanghai Donggou, Gaoqiao, and Wusong for military use. Therefore, since yesterday morning, the people in that area have changed their routes to Pudong Lannidu and Dongchang Road and transferred to other routes. The ferry service from Puxi to Pudong is operating as usual. The outcome of the clash is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Donation Campaign Should Guard Against Swindling</h3>
<p>All sectors of the city have been very enthusiastic in supporting donation campaigns in the past, and the results have been very good. However, recently, there was a case of soliciting donations of 400,000 yuan of condolence funds to all sectors in the name of the Shanghai Municipal Consolation Money Fundraising Committee. After investigation by relevant parties, it was said that there was no such thing, and there is no such organization at present. The association is obviously an illegal organization with other attempts, and it has claimed to have organized Spring Festival Military Comfort, Friends of Wounded Soldiers, Air Force Comfort, Mid-Autumn Festival Military Comfort, and Winter Clothing Money, etc., which are not consistent with the facts. Moreover, its attached so-called Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Condolence Fund Regulations also have provisions for dispatching personnel to collect money, which is enough to prove that it is a swindle. It is said that the relevant authorities of the city have informed all sectors to pay attention.</p>
<h3>American Missionaries in Zhejiang Mostly Evacuated; Elderly Pastor Hutcherson Also Returns Home on the Coolidge</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that several Americans left Shanghai on the President Coolidge today (the 31st), and Reverend Hutcherson of the American Southern Presbyterian Church in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, was among them. With Hutcherson's departure, almost all American missionaries in Zhejiang have evacuated. Hutcherson has been writing correspondence for the North-China Daily News since 1898. At the age of 73, he is still quite healthy. Although he is over the retirement age, he has repeatedly received requests to stay in office due to his effective service. This time, Hutcherson's determination is firm. It is said that it is useless for American missionaries to stay here, because if the United States and Japan go to war, the missionaries' stay will not only involve the Chinese people, but also be a burden to the American government. At that time, the Japanese will imprison the missionaries in concentration camps, and the Chinese who have contact with the missionaries will also encounter the same fate. The American women and children serving in the 25 churches in the Jiaxing area have been completely evacuated, leaving only one or two men to guard them. Chinese pastors are still working, but schools and hospitals have been closed.</p>
<p>The Coolidge Sets Sail This Morning</p>
<p>The American President Lines' President Coolidge came from the United States to the Far East this time. Because American volunteer pilots were on board to assist China, it went directly to the Philippines via Kobe. Now it has returned from the Philippines and arrived in Hong Kong the day before yesterday (the 30th) at 2:30 PM, berthed at floating buoys 11 and 12. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The mail ship stayed in Shanghai for a day and night and set sail at 2:00 AM this morning, leaving Shanghai for Japan, passing through Xiangshan, San Francisco, and returning to Los Angeles. The ship this time carried many American expatriates evacuating from Southeast Asia and this city. The passenger seats were full. There were 37 first-class passengers, 40 second-class passengers, and 95 third-class passengers, totaling 172 people, coming from Little Luzon and Hong Kong to Shanghai. Those who passed through Shanghai and returned to the United States on the original ship included 230 first-class passengers, 42 second-class passengers, and 305 third-class passengers, totaling 577 people. About 300 people boarded the ship in Shanghai to return to the United States. More than 80 missionaries from various places were also on board.</p>

<h3>How China Can Wage a Long-Term War (1)</h3>
<p>— Hu Shi</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, gave a very moving speech at the third "Bowl of Rice" campaign banquet in New York, entitled "The Sympathy of the American People," the original text of which was published in this newspaper on December 16 last year. Yesterday, we received Ambassador Hu's manuscript "How China Can Wage a Long-Term War?" sent by airmail from the United States.</p>
<p>This is another masterpiece that analyzes the factors of the Far East War from a scholar's perspective. Undoubtedly, the Chinese nation has lived in one country, one government, one law, one script, one education system, and one historical culture for 2,100 years. In any nation or any history, there are no similar examples of a nation under this kind of unified life. Ambassador Hu uses the methods and perspectives of historical research to explain how the Chinese nation can wage a long-term war.</p>
<p>On the New Year's Day of welcoming the year of victory, we publish this masterpiece, which may be worth savoring by readers!</p>
<p>The war of China's resistance against Japanese aggression has a history of exactly forty months as of the weekend of the first week of November 1940. China has been fighting for three years and four months.</p>
<p>This war, for a peaceful nation like China, which was unprepared beforehand, is a very difficult war, which I don't need to explain, I think you will know. You know that China has lost many important territories and countless lives. You know that the Japanese have almost completely controlled our skies and seas, as well as important railway lines and waterways. You know that almost all of our trade, industry, education, and cultural centers, from Peiping to Xuzhou, from Shanghai to Yichang, have been ravaged or occupied by the invaders.</p>
<p>You know that almost all of our famous universities and colleges have been relocated to the interior. They mostly have no books, no laboratory equipment, and are often at risk of air raids. You know that for two years, almost all of our sea routes have been completely cut off, and we have had to rely on three "back doors" to transport our military supplies from overseas and to transport our exports in exchange for foreign exchange. You also know that among these three "back doors," the land route to the Soviet Union is only suitable for transporting light goods; the railway through Vietnam has been closed since the collapse of France this summer, and is now actually seized by the invading Japanese army; the famous Burma Road was blocked by the British for three months and has recently been reopened.</p>
<p>Today is not to tell you the stories of these disasters and the almost insurmountable difficulties. No! What I am here to tell you is: despite the hardships, China continues to fight.</p>
<p>You are now witnessing two living miracles: the war in Britain and the war in China. The world has begun to realize that China and Britain are the only two countries that are still resisting aggression by force, and China has been engaged in combat for three long and difficult years.</p>
<p>You may ask: Under such difficult circumstances, why can China fight for so long when many European countries, which are stronger and better armed, cannot avoid surrendering one by one? Let me try to explain a few reasons.</p>
<p>China is naturally and genetically endowed with three things that are lacking in several European countries that have surrendered; second, vast manpower, third, a historical consciousness of national unity.</p>
<p>The vast space and vast manpower are obvious and need not be explained in detail. I only need to say that the Japanese army's occupation of Chinese territory is limited to a few large cities and some transportation lines. Even today, it is doubtful that Japan can claim to have controlled more than one-tenth of Chinese territory. Regarding manpower, even senior Japanese commanders themselves have publicly admitted that General Chiang Kai-shek still has three million well-trained troops. That is to say, Japan also admits that the number of Chinese troops today, not counting guerrillas, is greater than it was when the war broke out three years ago.</p>

<h3>Sir Victor Sassoon Returns to Shanghai After Trip to India: Broadly Discusses the General Situation, Saying U.S.-Japan War Would Only Benefit Germany, Shanghai's Situation Can Ultimately Remain Neutral</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily Mail reported that Sir Victor Sassoon, a prominent financier in the city, recently returned from India. Today (the 31st), he hosted a press conference at the Cathay Hotel to discuss the global situation, including the possibility of war between the U.S. and Japan, the roles of the Soviet Union and Italy in the Nazi "Lebensraum" (living space) plan, and the situation in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Free to Act Against Japan</p>
<p>Reportedly, he expressed doubts about Germany launching a blitzkrieg in the Balkans, as this would damage the region's summer grain harvest next year, endangering Germany's food supply. Germany, in its prolonged war against Britain, does not want to "disturb" the Soviet Union and hopes to maintain understanding with the Soviets, allowing them to act freely against Japan. This move suits the Soviet Union perfectly.</p>
<p>Germany Eager for U.S.-Japan War</p>
<p>Japan is currently being used by Germany, and Hitler's use of Japan is solely to fulfill his own selfish desires. If Japan were to go to war with the U.S., the only beneficiary would be Germany, as the U.S. would then have to keep most of the war supplies intended for Britain for its own use, weakening Britain's retaliatory power against Germany. Furthermore, Japan's supply lines in a war against the U.S. would be severely threatened by American submarines. Japan has sufficient oil reserves but faces extreme shortages of steel and cotton. Therefore, it is believed that Japan does not want to go to war with the U.S., and neither does the U.S.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Situation Unaffected</p>
<p>Sassoon further stated in response to questions that the European war would continue for at least another two years. The British government's policy is based on the possibility of a sustained war for three years, and munitions factories and various wartime activities are planned accordingly. Sassoon concluded by saying that when he left Shanghai six months ago, he was quite concerned about the situation here, but now he believes that Shanghai can maintain its neutrality and remain unaffected, which is a great relief, as Shanghai, apart from being designated as a public concession, has no other use to anyone.</p>
<h3>Winter Clothing Distributed Today: Clothing Vouchers Issued, Donations Urgently Needed, Women and Children Relief Association Airs Fundraising Appeal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association, recognizing the cold weather and the dire situation of homeless children on the streets without adequate clothing, who are at risk of freezing to death, launched a fundraising campaign to provide winter clothing for needy children throughout the city. Since the micro-donation campaign began on November 20th, it has received enthusiastic support and generous donations from all sectors of society. As of yesterday, over 30,000 yuan has been raised in donations. The association had already solicited bids on the 21st of last month and commissioned the production of 2,000 sets of winter clothing.</p>
<p>Types of Winter Clothing</p>
<p>The winter clothing is divided into four categories: Category A (for children aged 12 to 14), 500 sets; Category B (for children aged 9 to 11), 800 sets; Category C (for children aged 5 to 8), 500 sets; and Category D (for children aged 1 to 4), 200 sets. The average cost per set was originally estimated at six yuan. However, thanks to the sponsorship of Gu Tiansheng Flower Shop and Mao Xiong Dyeing and Weaving Factory, which offered special discounts on the purchase of cloth, cotton, and dyeing, the average cost per set is only five yuan in national currency. It is reported that all the winter clothing was completed yesterday. The association is scheduled to begin distribution on New Year's Day and has dispatched personnel to conduct on-site surveys in poor areas such as Nanshi, Hongkou, Caojiadu, and Xujiahui to distribute clothing vouchers in advance. The vouchers specify the location for clothing distribution, and recipients can then collect the winter clothing upon presentation of the voucher. Although the association's fundraising efforts have been successful, they have not yet reached the predetermined target. The fundraising campaign continues, and the association hopes that people from all walks of life will contribute as soon as possible to support this charitable cause.</p>
<p>Da Fu Donates Rice</p>
<p>Da Fu Foreign Firm, which specializes in the import of food grains, has been accumulating scraps of rice and maize during the past July and August from bulk shipments of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai on behalf of its customers. According to custom, the firm originally planned to distribute these scraps to its customers. However, Mr. Jin Yunsheng, the Chinese manager of the firm, proposed to the customers that the scraps be used for charitable purposes instead, entrusting the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) to distribute them to various charitable organizations. The donation consists of 65 bags of broken rice and 73 bags of maize. In addition, Mr. Jin personally donated 50 bags of Saigon broken rice No. 1 and No. 2. The SMC has been notified by letter to distribute these donations as well. Upon receiving the donations, the SMC, in addition to sending letters of thanks to the firm and Mr. Jin, has made the following distribution: (1) Salvation Army, 65 bags of broken rice; (2) Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation, 71 bags of maize; (3) Shanghai Civilian Maternity Hospital, [number missing] bags of Saigon broken rice; (4) Shanghai Refugee Relief Association First Hospital, 10 bags of Saigon broken rice; (5) Chinese Red Cross First Refugee Hospital, 10 bags of Saigon broken rice; (6) Pushan Villa, 10 bags of Saigon broken rice; (7) Old People's Home, 10 bags of Saigon broken rice.</p>

<h3>Living Standards of Workers in 1940: Prices Increase, Purchasing Power of Legal Tender Declines, Dropping to 17.25 Cents Last Month</h3>
<p>In December of last year, the cost of living for workers in the city saw another significant increase, mainly due to the continued rise in prices of rice and coal briquettes. The changes throughout the year have been dramatic and unusual. Now that the year is coming to an end, it is necessary to compare the situation in December with that of the previous month and December 1939 to understand the extent of the increase. Taking the stable prices of 1936 before the war as the base period, the total cost of living index for workers in Shanghai in December was 579.70, an increase of 39.08 points compared to 540.62 in November, and 275.64 points higher than 304.06 in December of last year, an average monthly increase of 23 points. The purchasing power of the national currency in December, compared to 1936, fell to 17.25 cents, compared to 18.5 cents last month and 32.89 cents in December of last year. The classified index and the comparison between December of this year, the previous month, and December of last year are shown in the table below.</p>

<h3>Illegal Transactions of Over-aged Rice: Authorities Confirm Facts, Successful Cooperation in Past Sales of Flour at Fixed Prices, Two Flour Mills Lost Over One Million in Revenue</h3>
<p>The concession authorities are determined to crack down on illegal trading in the rice market and thoroughly investigate rice hoarding. It is learned that several rice brokers have been found to have engaged in illegal transactions beyond the prescribed limits, and the police department of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) has dispatched personnel to investigate and verify the facts. They will be prosecuted according to law to deter troublemakers and prevent imitation.</p>
<p>Overview of Fixed-Price Flour Sales</p>
<p>Since the Battle of Shanghai, the food supply has been a constant challenge in this city. Flour, as an essential part of the people's diet, has often been subject to high prices and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, making it difficult for ordinary people to purchase. To suppress prices and regulate the food supply, the SMC reached an agreement with Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills at the beginning of 1940 to have the SMC properly manage all wholesale transactions of flour from the two concessions, determining the amount of purchases based on the needs of users to regulate the market. Subsequently, in February and June, the SMC convened meetings with various flour shops to decide that the flour sold by these shops should be priced at the factory price plus a handling fee of 30 cents. Users who needed flour were required to apply to the SMC first, and after approval, they could present a letter to the flour shop to purchase flour at the fixed price. Fortunately, both buyers and sellers were able to comply with the regulations, resulting in a satisfactory outcome. Small businesses and the working class were able to maintain their livelihoods, and the flour market remained relatively stable.</p>
<p>Three Phases of Sales</p>
<p>The first phase of the fixed-price flour sales ran from February 10th to March 19th of last year. Fufeng and Fuxin mills supplied each flour shop with 7,500 bags of flour daily at a factory price of ten yuan per bag. The flour shops were allowed to add a handling fee of 30 cents per bag at the retail level. The flour shops' enthusiastic service was commendable, and Fufeng and Fuxin mills' concern for the people's food supply and their willingness to sell flour at fixed prices were admirable. The former Chairman of the SMC, Mr. Fessenden, sent letters of thanks to both mills. The second phase of the fixed-price sales started on July 2nd and lasted for more than a month before concluding. The third phase of the fixed-price sales began on September 27th and continued until the end of the year, with the two mills supplying over 8,000 bags of flour daily (reduced to 5,646 bags in December). During this period, the factory price was raised several times due to the higher cost of imported wheat, so that the mills could barely cover their costs and ensure a normal supply of flour. In summary, the two mills sacrificed approximately one million yuan in revenue throughout the year due to the fixed-price sales of flour, benefiting the people and maintaining social order, which is admirable.</p>
<p>Cooperation from Foreign Firms</p>
<p>On November 26th, Mr. Marshall, Chairman of the Food Committee of the SMC, sent letters to Vida, Jardine Matheson, Daofu, Jardine, and Kung Li foreign flour import firms, requesting them to ask their clients to offer one-tenth of their orders to be redistributed to flour shops and sold at a fixed price of eighteen yuan per bag (the same as the local factory price), plus a handling fee of 30 cents. All the foreign firms expressed their support for the above proposal and agreed to comply. Their clients were also considerate of the authorities' efforts to stabilize the flour market and generously cooperated. By the end of the year, foreign flour had been withdrawn four times, totaling 71,996 bags. After distributing the flour to various flour shops for sale at a fixed price to users, a net surplus of 2,700 bags remained. The SMC sold the entire surplus to the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation for baking steamed buns to provide relief to the poor. Therefore, all the withdrawn foreign flour has been sold at a fixed price.</p>
<p>Flour Prices This Month</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the reduction in the number of flour bags supplied by the Fufeng mill in December of last year, the one-tenth of foreign flour withdrawn was used to supplement the supply. Therefore, throughout the entire month of December, except for Sundays and December 25th and 31st, users with licenses approved by the SMC in the two concessions could receive the approved quantity of flour daily, without any shortages. Those who have not received their flour can claim the outstanding amount from the designated flour shop. As for the flour prices for January of this year, the SMC has been in contact with the mills several times, but a final decision has not yet been reached. This is because it is necessary to consider the manufacturers' costs to ensure a continuous supply of raw materials, and also to consider the burden on users to prevent the flour price from being too high. Therefore, the price has not yet been finalized.</p>
<h3>Ding Da Cloth Shop's Shanghai Branch Dismantled, Occupied, Embezzling Funds of Seventy to Eighty Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Wuxi Ding Da Cloth Shop, located in Yongji Lane, Jiangxi Road, has been operating for many years. Zhu Shangyi was appointed as the director. The branch had the most business dealings with the Da Feng Cloth Shop on the second floor of the Eddie Road Cloth Exchange, buying and selling futures entirely on credit. From February 1939 to June 1940, Zhu embezzled approximately 70,000 to 80,000 yuan from the branch. Recently, the owner of Ding Da Cloth Shop discovered this and hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to file a lawsuit in the criminal division of the First Special Court, accusing Zhu of business embezzlement and breach of trust. They also requested the court to order the surrender of all accounting books. The court accepted the case, and judge Huang opened the third criminal court yesterday to summon the defendant Zhu Shangyi, who failed to appear. The plaintiff, Yuan Xiaokun of Ding Da Cloth Shop, and lawyer Lin Yingqing appeared in court to present the plaintiff's case. The court ordered a postponement and will summon the defendant Zhu Shangyi to appear for questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Rob Yitai Taxi, Kidnap Cotton Cloth Merchant, Ji Jinfu, Staying at Shanghai-Taiwan Hotel, Abducted by Gangsters in the Early Morning, Disappearing Without a Trace</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around six o'clock, two customers suddenly came to Yitai Taxi Company at 188 Hubei Road and hired a car, paying 15 yuan in advance for two hours of rental. The company sent driver Cai Adong (from Pudong) to drive the No. 1770 taxi. After the two customers got into the car, they instructed Cai to drive to Xiaoshadu Road. However, when they reached the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, the two customers suddenly revealed their true colors, pulled out guns and threatened Cai, forcing him to get out of the car. Cai watched as the two gangsters sped away. He reported the incident to the police. At the same time, after ousting Cai, the gangsters drove the car away. On the way, they met up with two other gangsters and drove to the entrance of Yingchunfang, Lane 203, Hubei Road and parked. They rushed into the Shanghai-Taiwan Hotel at No. 3 in the lane. It was around seven o'clock in the morning. One gangster guarded the main entrance with a gun, another monitored the telephone, and the remaining two gangsters went upstairs and broke into Room 25. They pushed open the door and kidnapped [missing text] who was still fast asleep and drove to Fuzhou Road in the Yitai taxi that had been hijacked from the lane entrance. Their whereabouts are unknown. After the police received the report, they immediately pursued the gangsters, but they had already escaped without a trace. It was found that the kidnapped passenger was Ji Jinfu, from Rugao, 38 years old, a cotton cloth merchant. The hijacked Yitai taxi was later found at the intersection of Kaixuan Road and Kainna Road.</p>

The exchange rates for other currencies such as Dutch, Taiwanese, and Japanese were also increased. As for the domestic market situation, the US banks were initially eager to supply, so the situation was strong, with the US dollar trading at 5.5625 yuan. However, thereafter, in addition to the constant demand from speculators, foreign firms were also active buyers, so by the evening, the US dollar had tightened back to 5.5 yuan. At the close, British gold was at 3 pence 484375, and the US dollar was at 5.5 yuan, both up 0.03125 from the previous day. From today onwards, it is the Lunar New Year, and banks are closed for three days, so there is no market.</p>

After opening, speculators showed a strong appetite for buying. Although US banks were actively supplying, the buying and selling eventually balanced out. It is estimated that a certain US bank and Chase traded the US dollar for January delivery to speculators at 5.5 yuan. The HSBC exchange rate announcement suddenly showed an increase of 0.125, with British gold adjusted to 3 pence 4375 and the US dollar to 5.4375 yuan. Other exchange rates also eased.

<h3>Outbreak of Selling Continues: Gold Market Rises and then Falls, Cash Price Still 40 Yuan Lower Than Futures Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market, in both official and unofficial trading, first rose and then fell. The 6,500 yuan mark was broken through and then re-entered. This was because it was only half a day of trading in the morning, and the foreign exchange market was rising in both official and unofficial trading. The trend of multi-party selling emerged again. At the opening in the morning, the US dollar was slightly tight, stirring up uncertain sentiments. Under the buying pressure from both gold and silver dealers, sellers did not dare to lower their hands, and the market was raised to a high of 6,570 yuan at the opening. However, a reversal soon began. The unofficial foreign exchange market followed the increase in the official exchange rate. The tendency of exchange dealers, securities firms, and the Shanghai West faction to sell led to a drop to 6,460 yuan. However, since it is the Lunar New Year starting today, there will be a three-day holiday, and short sellers were also eager to cover their positions, so the decline stopped and the market trended sideways. After briefly breaking through 6,500 yuan again, gold dealers were also seen selling, and the market closed at 6,480 yuan, the same as the previous day's closing price. Based on the midday closing price of the US dollar for January delivery at 5.53125 yuan, the settlement price was 6,315 yuan, an increase of 164 yuan. The total trading volume for the first half of the day was 6,000 to 7,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon. The cash price was still 40 yuan lower than the official futures price. Fengxiang sold 20 taels to Shengyuan each, and Xiangxing also sold a large 40 taels. Jewelry gold remained at 660 yuan. Customs gold and other prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>No Gain or Loss in Official Trading</p>
<p>Starting in the morning, because it was rumored that the US dollar for this month's delivery was only settling at 5.5 yuan, people's spirits were greatly boosted, and gold and silver dealers were eagerly buying. The price soared out of 6,500 yuan and continued to rise. The opening price at 9:15 AM had already risen to 6,570 yuan, 90 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. When news broke that the official exchange rate had increased and the unofficial exchange rate had also eased, the market momentum weakened. Exchange dealers, silver dealers, and securities firms began to sell heavily. A certain Shanghai West-based company also sold, and retail investors also flocked to sell, so the price fell sharply, dropping by 110 yuan to within 6,500 yuan, falling to 6,460 yuan. A certain money shop and another securities firm came to buy, and the easing trend of the foreign exchange market was minimal, so the price gradually recovered, breaking through 6,500 yuan again and rising to 6,518 yuan. At noon, gold dealers, money shops, and the Shanghai West faction again began to sell, and the market trend weakened again, falling by 30 yuan. The midday closing price was 6,480 yuan, showing no gain or loss compared to the previous day's closing price. After the closing, it fell further to 6,460 yuan, which was a result of floating profits being taken. There was a fluctuation of 110 yuan in the first half of the day. There was no market in the afternoon. The selling price of the official gold from cash shops was about 20 yuan lower than the official futures price, and the buying price was 40 yuan lower than the selling price. There was still no market or price for current standard gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael in silver jewelry stores remained at 660 yuan at Datong Bank and Xin Tonghang Bank, with the buying price reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Notes Rise by 0.2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw official prices rise and then return to steady levels. However, in the afternoon, due to the tightening of the foreign exchange market, the unofficial trading price rose again. As a result, British and US gold pounds also rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained unchanged, and the market price remained steady. US dollar notes initially retreated to 18 yuan after the market opened, but in the afternoon, due to the sudden tightening of the foreign exchange market, it briefly rose to 8.4 yuan, eventually settling at 18.3 yuan, an increase of 0.2 yuan from the previous day. The supply of Hong Kong notes decreased slightly, and the market price rose by 0.02 yuan. The demand for Japanese gold notes was strong again, and the evening market rose to 1.61 yuan. The supply of Korean notes remained strong, and the evening market continued to retreat to 1.27 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Declines Steadily</h3>

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt's Popularity Remains Strong, Again a Temporary Peak</h3>
<p>Government Bond Grey Market: Yesterday, the market only conducted transactions for half a day in the morning and closed in the afternoon for the New Year holiday. The holiday is for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. The market will open on Saturday the 4th for half a day. Yesterday's market conditions were due to the news that the United States would transport 400 aircraft to China, making the next year's counter-offensive seem more powerful. People's confidence grew stronger. At the same time, it was heard that there would be significant financial reforms to protect the fixed status of legal tender. The market's sentiment immediately became excited. The number of sales in the market suddenly decreased. The market prices of various debt firms gradually increased due to greater demand. Types A, B, and D all saw new high prices. Ju Xin Firm suddenly bought about 300,000. Tong Kang Jiu Fu and Lian He also had demand. Only Zhi Sheng Da Run Li and Xie Kang sold relatively more. The market closed at the highest price of the day, resulting in an increase of 1.5 to 5.5 jiao (tenths of a yuan). The turnover for half a day was about 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 100 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of 84 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Red and White Sugar's Rising Trend Is Intense</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's rising trend remained intense due to more purchases than sales. The guild's open market price for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar at the outer warehouse was 80 yuan and 4 jiao, and the price for orders placed on January 15th was 80 yuan and 8 jiao, an increase of 8 to 9 jiao. Spot Dutch red sugar initially rose to 67 yuan, then to 68 yuan, and later slightly loosened to 67 yuan and 5 jiao. The price for orders placed on January 15th was between 68 yuan and 5 jiao and 68 yuan, both increasing by 1.5 yuan. Taikoo's "B" mark refined white sugar was 80 yuan and 8 jiao at the main warehouse and 79 yuan and 8 jiao to 80 yuan at the west warehouse, an increase of about 1 yuan. The rising trend was more pronounced for lower-grade sugars. "DY" mark new sugar was 79 yuan and 3 jiao, an increase of 1 yuan and 8 jiao, and old sugar was 78 yuan and 2 jiao. "HX" mark new sugar was 79 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan and 6 jiao. "HM" mark was 73 yuan, and "H" mark red sugar was 64 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. 12,882 bags of Dutch sugar were transported by the Zhibade Wheel. Yesterday, another 2,000 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decrease in Sugar Inventory</h3>
<p>The city's sugar inventory has sharply decreased due to timely winter sales and purchases by certain parties. On the 10th of this month, the inventory of Dutch sugar was 121,498 bags. However, as of the end of last week, the inventory of Dutch sugar was only 85,999 bags, a reduction of 35,499 bags (excluding those arriving the day before). The recent inventory numbers are recorded below:</p>
<p>Commodity Type　 Inventory</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Longkou Noodles Slightly Looser</h3>
<p>Previously, Longkou noodles were scarce and mostly resold to Hong Kong, so the market price initially rose from 150 yuan to 160 yuan, and then from 160 yuan to 180 yuan, which can be considered extremely high. Recently, demand has weakened slightly, resulting in a loosening trend. Yesterday, the market price was 175 yuan, down 5 yuan, and other prices also loosened accordingly.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji Coal New Goods Arrive, Over 8,000 Tons</h3>
<p>Since the price increase of Hongji White Coal Slurry the week before, coal briquettes have responded by increasing factory prices. However, a large batch of new goods has arrived, so there is no concern about a shortage. Recently, a certain French merchant's ship arrived with more than 8,000 tons of No. 2 Slurry, which has already arrived at the port. The managing firms are arranging trucks at the dock to unload it. It is heard that more goods will arrive soon. The market price is nominally stable but secretly loose, and it will soon decline.</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Arrivals Reach Limit, Extra High-Quality Goods Still Not Sold</h3>
<p>Foreign rice is arriving in an endless stream, and new transactions are also being made continuously. Yesterday, it was confirmed in the market that Heyi sold 3,000 tons of small-grain rice loaded on January 10th, with a price of 84 yuan and 8 jiao. In addition, it is rumored that there were many more direct orders that were not announced, and some profit-takers were selling off their stockpiles as the market rose. Therefore, after the market opened in the morning, the prices of all grades were generally flat. No. 1 Saigon was 87 yuan, No. 2 was 81 yuan and 5 jiao, small-grain was 79 yuan, and Mi Lu was 78 yuan, all of which could be sold publicly at the assessed limit price. The lower grades were even sold below the limit price. Although the extra high-quality rice was not willing to be sold off lightly with the market, the market trend was indeed leveling off. However, spot transactions were quite brisk. In addition to some inventory held by customers, the demand from various firms in this street was very strong. Because of the New Year holiday and market closure, merchants were all stocking up in advance. Therefore, a total of 13,000 to 14,000 bags of rice were sold throughout the day. There were also 300 to 400 tons of futures, with prices similar to the previous day. The price for January Mitsui original small-grain was 85 yuan, the price for February Jian Yuan goods small-grain was 85 yuan, and the price for December 9th Xin goods was 93 yuan and 5 jiao. A small amount of foreign rice arrived yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Suiyang Wheel transported 686 bags from Hong Kong and arrived at the port at about 3 pm yesterday, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. It is heard that a large batch of pearl rice will arrive in Shanghai on the 5th. (Zu)</p>
<p>The sources of thick and thin japonica rice have mostly ended, so the amount arriving at the port has suddenly decreased, but the sales market is more active than in the past few days. Therefore, the price of thin rice is tight, increasing by about half a yuan to nearly a yuan, with Qingjiao goods opening at 93 yuan and 92 yuan and 5 jiao per dan (unit of volume). As for Kun white japonica rice, the price is only flat due to weaker sales, remaining at 98 yuan to 96 yuan, and a special price of 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the sales of glutinous rice are quite high, there are many sell-offs, resulting in uneven supply and demand, with prices down by a short yuan, opening at 93 to 94 yuan for Yili white and 84 yuan to 80 yuan for Hong Kong goods.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Stays Strong, Discount Flour Stops Supply</h3>
<p>The current flour market is quite stable because it is the end of the year holiday. Although customer sales are not particularly active, the stores on this street are stocking up a lot, and the discount flour has stopped being supplied. Various factories have temporarily stopped producing flour due to a lack of raw materials and will set a new method after the lunar new year. Therefore, people are increasingly hopeful. The overall market sold nearly 10,000 bags of Kaihua Wu and Zhonglou brand Australian flour, with prices ranging from 22 yuan, 5 jiao, 7 fen to 6 jiao. Before the end of the settlement period, merchants are unwilling to sell too much and will wait for the market to open after the new year before starting business.</p>
<p>The wheat market is tight as usual due to rising production costs and transportation difficulties. With the news of scarce arrivals and thin inventories, and the end of the lunar new year settlement period approaching, buying and selling are becoming increasingly deadlocked. It is heard that Japanese factories are not temporarily loosening prices, while Chinese factories are temporarily suspending purchases. Therefore, the market is exceptionally calm. The market will be closed for three days for the lunar new year holiday and will reopen as usual on the 4th.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Closed for Three Days, Oil Market First to Raise Prices, Oil Merchants' Speculative Mentality Generally Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the lunar year, and the market will be closed for three days for the New Year, reopening as usual on the 4th. Therefore, the miscellaneous grains market was completely stalled. However, the oil market, due to speculative sentiment and the three-day closure, raised the prices of various oils by nearly two yuan in the afternoon. The reason is that the Dalian soybean oil futures market, under the manipulation of hoarders, jumped by 3.5 yuan, leading those with quick minds to anticipate a price increase when the market reopens, so they raised prices in advance to wait for the profits to come in. Yesterday, the trading volume was 150 pieces of unrefined Jiaozhou oil at a price of 89 yuan to 90 yuan and 5 jiao, and 200 pieces of new goods at a price of 90 yuan to 91 yuan and 5 jiao. There were 30 barrels of unrefined Qingdao oil at a price of 124 yuan and 5 jiao, and 50 barrels of new goods at a price of 125 yuan. There were 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at a price of 80 yuan to 81 yuan, 50 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil at a price of 80 yuan, 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil at a price of 85 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil at a price of 109 yuan, and 100 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at a price of 115 yuan and 5 jiao. In addition, over 1,000 barrels were ordered for future delivery, with prices ranging from 113 yuan and 5 jiao to 116 yuan and 5 jiao for the first half of January, 115 yuan for the second half of January, 116 yuan to 117 yuan for the first half of February, and 300 dan (a unit of weight) of Daya Factory soybean oil at a price of 90 yuan to 93 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,600 cans of unrefined oil arrived from Yantai. Today, 1,130 bags of soybeans, 1,115 bags of sesame seeds, and 100 bags of raw kernels will be shipped together to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Year-End Relationship, Cotton Yarn Bulls and Bears, Mostly Squaring Positions</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had plummeted wildly the previous day, returned to a state of tranquility yesterday. This is because the exchange rate has stabilized, while gold is still expensive, so people's minds are stable. However, actual transactions have naturally decreased due to the changing year, and the turnover of buying and selling in the market is also lower than the previous day. Also because of the year-end, both the bulls and bears are mostly squaring their positions to avoid the risk of the three-day New Year market closure. Everyone is shortening their trading positions to wait for the new spring to begin development.</p>
<p>The Double Horse opened in the morning, and the price had recovered well after the afternoon of the previous day, and people's confidence continued to rise. The opening price was 1,370 yuan. Once this price opened, everyone expected the exchange rate to shrink, and there were quite a few buyers. The price gradually rose to 1,379 yuan, but some bulls sold out, and the price loosened again. Then it was heard that the exchange rate opened slightly longer, and the price of gold fluctuated greatly, and people's minds turned tired, and the price gradually fell to 1,366 yuan. Buyers made small purchases in the middle, and Sheng Da had both purchases and sales. Later, it slowly recovered to 1,379 yuan, and the closing price returned a few yuan, to 1,374 yuan. According to statistics, the half-day turnover was 5,500 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 18 yuan. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Fellow Merchants 5,200 Hong Kong 170</p>
<p>Yunnan 100 Tianjin 25</p>
<p>Ningbo 5 Total 5,500</p>
<h3>Cotton Mills' Appetite Is Weak</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is slightly weak because the price of yarn is mediocre, and the mills' intention to purchase is particularly weak, so people's minds are not firm. Moreover, there is no hope for active development from any party in the middle of the end of the year.</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, and specifically, fine Egyptian cotton, rose in the early morning due to purchases by speculators. Subsequently, the price increased again due to the increase in the domestic consumption of raw cotton and purchases by some industry colleagues. As a result, the closing price was more than ten pounds higher than the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by 4 rupees.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been unusually quiet recently. The mills' intention to purchase is weak, and industry colleagues are unwilling to sell at low prices. As a result, there is no improvement in the transaction of raw cotton. However, the general expectation is that the cotton market will improve after the New Year.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Repeatedly Suffers Setbacks</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday because it has reached the end of the year's final settlement period. The market has repeatedly suffered setbacks, and people's minds are weak. Most are watching and waiting, and transactions are scarce, waiting for next year's red market to discuss transactions again. The selling prices are fixed and rarely changed. The street traded in scattered amounts of coarse and fine cloth, twill, bleached and dyed cloth, etc., for more than 200 pieces. The Zhejiang Road, Wenyong gangs imported nearly 100 pieces of Dapeng, Fugui, fine cloth, Yihe bleached cloth, and striped bleached cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and coarse and fine cloth.</p>
<p>The morning market for eastern cloth was flat, and the afternoon market was firm. The closing price for white goods Longtou fine cloth was 41 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen. Sijunzi serge was sold at 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 7 fen per yard.</p>
<p>For export, 45 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 9 pieces to Penang, and 20 pieces to Hong Kong for transshipment to Yangon.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Cigarette Distribution Fails to Meet Market Sales</h3>
<p>The cigarette market has remained tight for the past few days. The factories' distribution of goods is insufficient to meet market sales, and all items are trending upward. Therefore, everyone has strong confidence, and those who hold goods are unwilling to sell them, all holding on tightly and not buying, making it difficult for market prices to fall. Yesterday, the price of Great Britain Brand was 1,385 yuan, Old Knife Brand was 985 yuan, Pinhai Brand was 875 yuan, Wuhua Brand was 675 yuan, Little Fairy was 675 yuan, Huacheng Company's Beautiful Brand was 960 yuan, and Gold Rat Brand was 940 yuan. The factories are closed for three days, and the market price is still expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Matches and Soap Also Feel the Shortage</h3>
<p>The match market has continued to rise in price for the past few days because the amount on the market is decreasing daily. Those who purchase and sell to the market provide a small supply to the market, causing market prices to soar. Yesterday, the market price of Beautiful Brand was 390 yuan per box, Phoenix Brand was 385 yuan, and Miscellaneous Brand was around 360 yuan, all up more than 30 yuan from last week.</p>
<p>The soap market price is tight with buying interest because raw materials are soaring in price. The factories have distributed a small amount to industry colleagues to meet the market, resulting in firm prices. Gu Ben Soap is sold on the market for 24 yuan and 4 jiao per box, Xiang Mao Soap for 18 yuan and 8 jiao per box, and White Xiang Mao for 22 yuan and 8 jiao per box. (Kun)</p>
<h3>Metals: New Spun Yuan Sees Setbacks, Narrow Strip Steel Sells Well</h3>
<p>The market for new spun yuan has seen several new price changes in one day in the past due to repeated tightening of the exchange rate, with the highest price reaching 80 yuan. However, since yesterday and today, the price has loosened, the gold market has fallen, and industry colleagues have not dared to push up prices. Therefore, the opening price of new spun yuan has also seen gradual setbacks. Yesterday, the price was 75 to 76 yuan per dan, down 3 to 4 yuan from before, and transactions were still scarce.</p>
<p>The trading of American narrow strip steel has been quite brisk recently. Because several factories on this street saw the high prices of tinplate and Huisit iron, they have switched to buying narrow strip steel, so the market is particularly lively. Actual sales are more considerable than other goods. Therefore, those who deal in this are not weak in confidence, and their opening prices are very firm. Yesterday, the market price for 200-pound assorted colors was between 120 yuan and 130 yuan per box.</p>
<h3>Retrospective of Cement Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Yue</p>
<p>Before the war, China's cement was self-sufficient, and supply and demand were balanced. Although there was no surplus for export, there was also no need to rely on foreign goods. Since the outbreak of the war, the war zone has gradually moved westward, and Shanghai's environment has been special, with abnormal commercial development, and the population has also increased sharply. The demand for housing exceeds supply, so new houses are being built like bamboo shoots after the rain to meet the needs of society. Cement, as an important product in buildings, was supplied to the Shanghai market before the war by Shanghai's Elephant Brand, Qixin's Horse Brand, and China's Taishan Brand. However, after the war moved westward, Shanghai's China Factory was located in the occupied area and naturally could not ship goods. The market was supplied only by Horse Brand and a small amount of Japanese goods. Later, although Shanghai's China Factory was opened by a certain party, the amount supplied for commercial use was very small. Until last year (1940), Horse Brand had only 5,000 to 6,000 barrels arriving in the New Year, and was then restricted by the local authorities and not allowed to be shipped to Shanghai. The Shanghai market immediately felt panic, and prices rose accordingly. In addition, coal prices soared, increasing the cost of cement, leading to endless price increases. A table is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Month　 Price per Barrel (Yuan)</p>
<p>1　 12.00 to 17.00</p>
<p>2　 17.00 to 22.00</p>
<p>3　 22.00 to 22.00</p>
<p>4　 22.00 to 34.00</p>
<p>5　 34.00 to 51.00</p>
<p>6　 51.00 to 53.00</p>
<p>7　 53.00 falling to 51.00</p>
<p>8　 51.00 to 54.00</p>
<p>9　 54.00 to 60.00</p>
<p>10　 60.00 to 72.00</p>
<p>11　 72.00 falling to 70.00</p>
<p>12　 70.00 falling to 58.00</p>
<p>Looking at the right table, January, February, and March were still relatively flat. After June, the price had reached its peak. Unexpectedly, since September, a certain party has strictly controlled it, and the supply for commercial use has further decreased. Operators have taken the opportunity to hoard and speculate, causing the price to rise again and again, and to become heated. However, it is certain that things will reverse when they reach their extreme. It is common business practice for merchants to seek profit. Various cement merchants believed that there was profit to be made and ordered foreign goods from foreign merchants, hoping to gain high profits. However, the isolated island is a small place, and its appetite is limited. Cement is not like rice or cotton, which can be stockpiled for a long time. Since the beginning of last month, more than 20,000 bags of Red Dragon brand cement have arrived one after another. At the end of last year, another 15,000 bags of Indian cement arrived, and there are still 20,000 to 30,000 bags of Red Dragon brand already loaded on ships and on the way. When the news spread, the market price plummeted. In addition, the exchange rate fell, increasing costs instead. Not only is it impossible to profit, but there will also be losses. This trend was not anticipated from the beginning and was due to a lack of overall planning.</p>
