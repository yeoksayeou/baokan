<p>社評</p>
<h3>巴爾幹大戰與蘇聯</h3>
<p>巴爾幹大戰已進行了四天，德軍攻勢之盛比較去春的西綫戰事固顯見遜色，但亦不可吾認在其猛烈進犯之下可能獲得若干進展，東色雷斯與薩洛尼加那一沿海狹長地區，聯軍扼守較難，或不免放棄若干陣地以牽就戰略的運用。這消息也許會使切望聯軍勝利的人們失望，其實却並沒有沮喪的理由；巴爾幹戰事的擴大，根本就是納粹被迫不能不從軍事上謀補救政治進攻的失敗，如其所得僅屬若干地區的佔領，却不得不把若干大軍和注意力都牽制在這一隅，且其後方的石油食糧供應都將因此遭受重大破壞，得失相較，遠不足以相抵償，而且假如德軍不能以閃電之勢從速結束這一戰事，則其進攻英國一舉勢將更難遂行。</p>
<p>巴爾幹戰事的前途，不僅決於雙力慘烈的戰鬥，而更在於種種有關國際因素之如何開展，諸如土耳其對於日益接近海峽的戰事具何反應，美國對於英希南國的援助能吾即時到達，都具有重大決定作用，而蘇聯在此一新的形勢之下將如何應付和自處更是舉世矚目的問題。照已往的傳統，蘇聯外交縱曾有神秘之觀，其政策基點總是經常宣示於外，而自從三國盟的成立以後，蘇方却突變為沉默隱晦，絕少公開發表過對外政策，即在不久以前的最高議會大會亦復如此，無可諱言在這沉默之中正復有所醞釀。而蘇德雙方的關係，却不斷有許多微妙爭執梗阻其間，從多瑙河航行問題以至最近蘇南協定的締結，都可看出兩國間的親和已逐漸爲若干陰翳所籠罩。在納粹方面，其對於多瑙河流域與夫巴爾幹的經營，固相當避免刺激蘇方觀感，在事實上却是個無法調和的矛盾。而且蘇聯對於保加利亞參加軸心的聲明，對土對南兩不侵協定所間接加於德國的警告，也都並未爲德方所尊重。巴爾幹戰爭擴大之後，蘇聯在那一區域保持和平的願望已成泡影；德軍對東色雷斯的攻佔，對英一時尙少影響，但却直接危及土國，間接威脅蘇聯，此際的蘇德之間儼然又是前歲德軍佔有波蘭以後形勢的複演。而在黑海沿岸，已經沒有像芬蘭及波羅的海三小國那些中立國家存在，可供蘇聯從容增强國防。目前的情勢如果再繼續發展下去，自不免演成兩國間對立的表面化，倫敦所傳蘇德將發生衝突之說，也許尙非此際莫斯科當局所願公開承認，在事實上，却是必然的歸趨。</p>
<p>正當歐戰逐漸向着蘇聯邊境蔓延之際，日外相松岡恰由柏林遄返經過蘇京，連日方與蘇方當局進行外交談判，自其逗留時日看來，松岡對於此一談判，也許比較其在柏林羅馬的酬酢感到更大的興趣，切望蘇日間的不侵協定能以此行而締成。以常理論，目前蘇聯不能不以絕大注意力關懷巴爾幹形勢的發展，自不能不期望東疆的安全無事，適與其在歐戰爆發之前對日成立諾蒙汗停戰協定時情勢相似。而且穌聯之於歐洲，既與交戰國之德南雙方都有不侵協定的存在，則在遠東之把已與中國存在着的協定關係同樣給予日本也並非不可能、松岡大概也就是覷定這些因緣纔決定在莫斯科多事停留以免此度赴歐之行徒勞往返。但是，如果詳加考按，便不難發現蘇日間若締不侵協定，雖並小與蘇方一貫立塲相違反，其後果却與其他同樣協定大異其趣，已往的中蘇蘇德蘇土蘇南各的，都有助於蘇聯的安全與國防，這種效果，却斷不能從蘇日間的同樣協定得到。而且日本之亟求訂立此的，用意不外便於南進，以便與德軍在巴爾幹的攻勢互相呼應，其結果自然是更增強納粹氣炤和聲勢；縱然南進之望未必能輕易獲遂，亦當牽制英美一部實力，影響到聯軍對德軍的抵抗，這都恰與蘇聯本身利益相違反。另一方面，此的之於日本，固然寄以無上的估價，而蘇聯究能取得何等權益以為交換則仍為疑問。在松岡一流，也許急切求有成就，不惜慷慨從事，無所慳吝，但那又必非今日日本舉國所願聞。以蘇聯當局之沉摯精明，當不致見不及此吧？</p>
<p>歐戰進行已將二十閱月，就對蘇外交言，始終還是民治國家內外政策中的最弱一環；最近蘇方態度之較形積極，促成之者不是民治國家而是納粹。最近遠東方面所召集的英美荷印軍事聯席會議是一個應付未來事變的賢明措施，但此際遠束所迫切需求的不只是民治國間的聯防。而更是各民治國與蘇聯的密切合作。</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（四三）　戰時德國的內幕</h3>
<p>而且每天還要用二百輛火車、運煤經過阿蘭帕斯山，去接濟義大利。即以這一端而論，巳是火車運輸上的大問題了。</p>
<p>每當冬尾春初，多瑙河冰凍未解，運油船無法駛行，所有從惜德國的運油車非常缺乏，據羅馬尼亞的煤油專家告訴我，德方國內所有的陳舊運油車巳經個部　用，把普羅業十忒油田裏的出產，源源向德國輸送。蘇聯的運油車其軌距較德國的為闊，內之不能在德境內的軌道上駛行。德人一定要設法把許多運油車在邊界，以待蘇聯的油運到時，可以轉運國內。一般人都不相信，去年德方所獲的蘇俄煤油會超過一百萬噸之數。</p>
<p>可是德人現在做出藏油很豐富的樣子。戰時德國油業鉅子史契爾少將會力稱，德國決不缺油，他的話當然不無誇大之處。一件事值得說的，就是備國在製造飛機時，其引擎設計以能燃燒德產煤斤中所提煉出來的人造汽油為主體。現在有許多德機巳在使用這種燃料。除英國空軍把他們的主要煉油廠炸毀之外，這種燃料的供給是不會斷絕的。英空軍對於這種地方，轟炸已不止一次，並且炸到了琉納地方的主要煉油廠，但據我們知道，其損害程度尚不嚴重，不至影響於其產量。此外，政府對於民間之消耗汽油，力加限制。除非與國事有關，民人不得隨意駕用汽車。私人運貨汽車也受到極大影響。能維持運貨服務的店，為數已極少。只有購買大件的東西如鋼琴之類，商店尚可代送之外，其餘東西咸由顧客自行携歸。</p>
<p>德人在荷蘭，比利時，及法商西境內所攫得的油，為數究屬幾何，無人得知，但其數量一定極為可觀。去年當我隨著德軍穿過比境時，看見聯軍方面所委遺而未加燒毀的汽油之多，令人驚異。即以比利時之柯爾特萊一地而論，英軍雖有極允份的時間去燒毀它們，德軍所獲的汽油竟多至二十五萬加侖。我於十二月間離開柏林時，市上汽油充斥，比較開戰以來的任何時為多。我以外國新聞通訊員資格，每個月雖可購得汽油三十七加侖，在一年之前，我終究把汽車束之高閣，因為柏林市所有汽油站，均已枯竭得無油可注了。去年各季，油站中已充滿汽油，如要獲得三十七加侖，當然毫無問題的了。</p>
<p>主持這次大規模全面戰爭的是希特勒一個人。他一切獨斷獨行，對於各高級軍官的建義，往往漠然視之。他獨來獨往，也沒有一個知已朋友，自從羅埃姆在一九三四年清黨時被害後，運戈林，郭堵爾或赫斯對於希特勒都不敢直呼以「你」。平時他的所在地是一種軍事秘密，從不外曳。從前他的待從们常肯把他的行動，如打算何时離開柏林等消息，向外國新聞記者，「丟個眼色」洩漏一二，自戰事發生以來，這班人都守口如瓶了。沒有打仗之前，衹要觀看總理府上面所扯的希特勒私人旗幟，便可以知道他是否在柏林。現在秘密警察總監希墨萊，不問元首是否在柏林，他總是把那面將旗高高的懸在總理府屋頂上。報紙上對於希特勒的行蹤也隻字不提，美國新聞記者連希特勒打算到那裏去度聖誕佳節的消息，在事前也無從獲知了。</p>
<p>希特勒現在已不常和他左右要人們同餐了。他的伴侶，目下衹限於早年和他同時奪門的幾個黨裏的熟朋友。像會任副官主任的勃魯克納，一度做過他私人秘書的赫斯，上次大戰時他的頂頭軍曹，現任德國一家擁資極鉅的出版公司總理麥克斯，阿孟等人。這些國社黨中的頭兒，和希特勒見面之時，不時在白書預約好，便是晚上吃過夜飯後，元首邀他們觀看私映電影。德國僅有這少數幾個人曾經看到個「亂世佳人」那部影片。郭培爾甚至不欲國社黨的官員們的觀此片，因恐他們回想到德國所攝製的影片，那樣「糟糕」而費錢，以致引起不快的感覺。</p>
<p>在軍事方面，希特勒大權獨攬，陸軍總司令勃侖契區將軍唯元首命之是聽，季台爾將軍在希特勒和參謀部之間，其地位衹像一個中間人而已。參謀長哈爾陀Frang　Halder　豐功偉績不可抹煞，波蘭及西綫諸役都是他所建的奇功，可是希特勒不喜其人，在法國戰敗後，並不授以上將銜。喬特爾將軍Alfred　Todl　是希特勒私人參謀長，但默默無聞，外間知者甚少。</p>
<p>德國人對於希特勒之侵略他國，道德上良心上感覺不巡者，為數甚少。他們對於「第五縱隊」的活動亦不甚了了。德國雖已戰勝了捷史，波蘭，丹麥，挪威，荷蘭，比利時和法國西，但是人民都惴惴於懷，深恐他們一旦起來，報復這仇恨。柏林一個汽車修理匠，對於希特勒並無好感，會經說道，「你雖然不喜歡希特勒，但是還是叫他打勝仗的好。要是我們戰敗，希特勒和國社黨都完了。我們一定要受波蘭，捷克，挪威和荷蘭人的宰割。他們如來報仇，我們決無瞧類。換句話說，我們如果戰勝，那末也好像美國一樣的繁榮了。」郭培爾對於這點，亦大為鼓吹之下。八千萬德人都希望勝利，雖則沿英吉利海峽一帶，去秋德軍在那裏大挖戰壕，佈置鐵絲綱，以防英軍來襲。德人對於去秋沒有戰勝英國，未免抱有遺憾。但是他們總以為能獲勝的罷。（完）</p>

<h3>糧食新定證實到貨旺　洋米囤戶兢相脫售　惟有常粳糯米尚漲二三元</h3>
<p>洋米昨市晨間初開、販戶客囤承上日餘勢、借題發揮、欲施其操縱故技、引起業外新囤盲目附和、形勢乃見續緊、各價再度飛騰、較之前日上午收盤、曾提二三元不等、若一號西貢開百十一元、二號百十二元、白身小紋百十一元、碎尖且見來源續有大批抵埠、且洋米新定已經證實、浮戶兢先爭脫、市乃立即下降一二元、午收已比前晚見疲、下午賣氣更旺、市形尤呈軟象、結果各米均比前晚小一元至一元半、而碎米小去有二元、收盤二號西貢、仍僅百十三四元、二號百十元、一號暹邏百十二三元、火紋百十二元、次百十元、白身小紋百十元、中關百零九元、次百零七八元、東　砶尖百零二元、特別百零四元、碎尖九十元、蕪湖尖百十元、百零九元、回籠小絞早市開一百三十一元至一百三十一元半、碎米開一百零五元至一百零五元半、比前午漲二三元、然至午後、喊低二三元、仍乏受主、全日成交現米二萬包、回籠原包約七百噸、新成交計合義小紋五百噸、價一百三十一元三角、又西貢一號五百噸、價一百三十四元八角、西貢一號五百噸、價一百三十三元、達孚等亦有數起在洽商中、因此次有船位、大約尚有若干續妥也、</p>
<p>一方面到源、仍屬不絕、法公司金第亞號輪昨晨到埠、由西貢直接運來洋米一萬三千五百餘包、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、怡和洋行利生輪、亦於昨晨抵滬、由香港裝來洋米一萬零　百零一包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、另有三千七百包、定明日原船運往靑島、間今日有大批緬甸洋米到滬、係馬勒輪由仰光裝來、確數容探明續報、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、到貨依然寥　不過銷場方面、店舖作客、見洋米一再奔勝、國米比較已見　宜、不約而同、突起兢辦、一時粟洛異常、似有供不敷求之慨、貨主遂秉機扳俏、喊聲狂飛、市價即見猛提三四元之巨、計開常幫斛見淸特粳百二十四元、特白粳百二十二元、百二十元、崑山斛見高粳百十八元、市白粳百十五六元、中次貨亦須百十二三元、靑角斛見薄稻百十二元半、百十二元、次百十元零五角、原包未聞做開、</p>
<p>糯米際此佳檔、零　去路悉旺、售價一致趨昂、開香港特元百十元、百零九元、普通百零六七元、中關百零四元、糯　特別百零一元、一百元、普通九十七八元、糯碎九十三四元、比前暴漲二三元不一、</p>
<h3>南洋客銷活動　粉市續趨向榮</h3>
<p>麪粉　昨日現粉市况、以南洋幫客銷活動、香港等處去化蟬聯、兼之太平洋風雲日趨惡劣、雖在存到兩多之下、人心莫不望好、市場買氣不衰、澳粉鐘樓花鳥兩牌價又提至二十九元五角、羅斯福棧貨須加二角、金　牌坎粉亦已躍出二十九元關　、至二十九元〇五分、惟中途因傳米價回鬆、獲利囤戶略有吐出、局勢帶疲、傍晚又告平穩、華廠平賣粉仍為二十五元、仍由福新廠批出五千餘包、</p>
<p>小麥　昨小麥市况、尤居堅穩、蓋以內地到貨稀寥、在米粉漲勢下、人心一味扳俏、市場復有五十元之喊聲、聞日廠門市收價、仍為四十五六元、偶有零星收進而已、</p>
<h3>油市　荳油仍有操縱</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市面、先承上日之餘威晨盤續漲元外、入後原根方面傳放出二千餘桶實籌碼、致人心鬆動、浮多趁勢踢出、行情頻見下瀉、遠期運油在最疲時曾比上日市挫跌二元之譜、但不久被大囤戶强力拉抬、市又翻高、結果仍漲起半元左右、廠油因範圍狹隘、漲跌趨勢比較為慢、故昨市承上日之潛勢、見好三元、計成交一百五十担、價為一百零九元至十元、大連油做開現貨二百桶、價為一百五十三元至五十二元、訂四月上交三百五十桶、價為一百五十二元五角至一百五十二元、訂四月下交一千五百桶、價自一百五十三元至五十元、三番起伏、收盤時復至五十二元、花生油趨勢平常、市無重大起伏、做開烟台聽裝油　百聽、價為價一百五十八元云、</p>
<h3>金融　外滙續有　相當結款</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌仍平、英美滙暗市情况、續無生色、惟市面因實需仍繁、如日紗廠與油洋行等均來扒結、故走勢趨軟、雖港電曾來拋塞、但英行有利頗俱吃胃、致結果仍軋緊〇一五六二五及〇三一二五、為三辦士二〇三四三七五、及五元三一二五、收盤期貨英亦稍軟、美則告平、</p>
<p>港方拋出先令</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條及美銀價與倫敦生金等仍告平定、滙兌除美滬跌二分外、其餘仍平、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士二五、　滙五元四四三七五、較隔昨無分榮辱、開後外行互做本月份美滙五元三四三七五、市况平定、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦平、此後日紗廠與油洋行等前來扒結、且外行有利與投機商亦來吸納、市面因之微緊、計做開四五月期美滙五元三一二五、不久雖港電曾來拋賣先令、但有利仍懷買意、故市勢依然告緊、成交過現先令三辦士二五、入後買賣稀少、狀態呆滯、直至收盤、缺乏變化、結果現期英金均告三辦士二三四二七五、美滙俱為五元三一二五、較上日現貨英緊〇一五六二五、美軟〇三一二五、期貨英亦縮〇一五六二五、美則未分軒輊、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港申滙上升</p>
<p>香港九日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、申滙現貨獨升一元二角五分、為四百六十元〇二角五分、餘無變動、十一時三十分告平、各滙槪無變動、十一時五十八分告平、申滙現貨升一元、為四百六十一元六角五分、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津英美　長</p>
<p>天津九日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤呆滯、倫敦電滙鬆〇九三七五、為三便士三一二五、紐約電滙長一　五、為五元四三七五、申滙降二元、為九十八元「聯鈔。」回賤三元七角半、為六十一元二角半、</p>
<h3>現金背期貨　反見低落</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗盤、上落範圍仍狹、而潛勢續告堅挺、結果又漲三十二元、乃滙市報緊、且掉期逼近、因照滙豐櫃檯掛牌五元三一二五計算、合烚赤六千五百五十五元三角、故此次掉期、仍須空方貼出、致浮空續有抵補、為數較上日尤多、故價易向上升、中以德孚天元大豐明豐等收吸最力、收盤卒告六千五百三十七元、半天成交約一萬二三千兩、至四月份掉期、今日下午一時開始、二時為止、掛牌（即開盤）則一點一刻、現金市勢因客幫吃胃鬆弛、遂告步落、成交亦少、衹初時德大進義豐五十兩、加一百八十元、此後買戶杳然、最後加一百七十元、有人賣出、買方衹肯加一百三十元、照上日疲落一十元光景、</p>
<p>今日開始掉期</p>
<p>晨初每條（十兩）、開時照掛牌進出頗多、但因成記力塞二百五十兩、遂衹告六千五百元開盤、較上日反撳五元、但不久鑫源·恒記·德孚·德成·等狂撈、雖成記續售數百兩、但衝出六千五百十元、時亦止賣為進、故立昂達六千五百二十九元、後以祥和·德大·多頭吐出、恒記反進爲塞、未幾回至六千五進十元、卒因滙市微緊、買風復起、明豐·益大·公和·等力進、漲至六千五百四十元、惟斯時浮多獲利脫手加之恒記力賣二千兩、又跌至六千五百二十五元入後天元·大豐·德孚·等狂進補空、收盤前重高至六千五百四十二元、後新豐永賣出、故結果告六千五百三十七元、比上日續回漲三十二元、照四月美金五元三一二五結價、為六千五百五十五元二角九分、計撳十八元二角九分、半天四十二元上落、現金號之本牌金與現標金等均無行無市、</p>
<p>飾金掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩況出、十時許掛大十元、討大同行與新同行改懸六百九十元、收進減低四十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣漲多跌少</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價繼漲、英美金鎊因亦續漲一元、英金票仍呆定、美金票步高至四角六分、最後為十八元四角五分、比上日軋升五分、香港票續漲一分、此外如新加坡票·及安南·羅比·坎拿大·菲列濱·等票、均趨上漲、日金票及朝鮮票亦繼續挺漲、前者高至一元九角七分半、後者升為一元六角九分、</p>
<h3>紗花　雜牌紗所漲已多　雙馬紗一鼓作氣</h3>
<p>紗市續升、漲風甚熾、此因盤旋已久、雜牌紗已步步上漲、程度　殊深、雙馬紗蓄勢已久、近以有裝運海外之舉、於是投機紛紛活動、一鼓作氣、買戶蜂擁而來、同時棉布暢銷、價格甚昂、比較棉紗獨廉、雙馬處此環境之下、買風驟盛、市盤遂復蘇向上、最高價為一千四百卅七元、低價為一千四百〇九元、午後漲勢更烈、初做一千四百三十八元旋聞雙馬又有出口消息、買氣尤濃、漲至一千四百四十九元、已漲過三月二十五日高價、為一千四百四十二元、中途有獲利吐出、回至一千四百三十八元、最後價為一千四四百四十三元、但傍晚做至一千四百五十元云、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日午後堅挺之氣續進、目形勢甚强首盤價為一千四百十三元、然獲利者紛紛出檔、但空頭不動、故微降至一千四百〇九元、然雜牌紗情况頗昂、港幫對於雙馬紗納胃頗健、買者興緻尤濃、漲至一千四百二十七元、此時標金又復回漲、人心頗堅、且檯面買風奇俏、直升至一千四百三十七元、又回至一千四百三十二元、收盤價仍為一千四百三十六元、查半日間成交統計九千二百三十五包、茲將各幫買去之額量分列如後、</p>
<p>香港八三五、同行八、四〇〇</p>
<p>統計九、二三五</p>
<h3>細絨棉更居奇</h3>
<p>現棉情况仍屬堅俏、因紗市良好、加之四二支三二支細紗綫價格大漲、於是原料更為奇貨可居、至於美印棉市邇來轉趨疲弱、然上海現貨情形無甚影響、實為存貨缺乏之故也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因各方了結及華爾街股票軟弱而跌、昨日收盤價格較之上日低落五至十二磅音不等、印度棉市頗平、先因同業買進而漲、後因一部分了結回跌、收盤價格略漲一羅比左右、又預測今日開盤之市况看低一羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、情狀更形熱門、連日各方人心均極興奮、加之紗市又在逐步挺進之中、故市況繼續活躍、高號與廠方皆有大批購進也、</p>
<h3>證券　內債絕少振作　明日起休業四天</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况依然毫無振作之象、雖有鉅額買進、但隨時有鉅額賣出、仍係銀行領款屆期、現貨流出、各家均有、在未曾賣完之前、市價絕不易回　、加以自明日起春假休息、連星期共有四天無市、故大都不願假期做多、以免利息之吃虧、今日丙種舉行抽籤、昨日下午即已除資計算、故上下午市價截然不同、其他各種仍係疲　能興之象、今日衹做半日、恐亦未必有何變動耳、昨上午恒孚代順昌買進四十萬丙種、怡泰買進戊種三十萬、而裕興賣出戊種即有四十萬、協興元及鴻大出丙種卅餘萬、供求情形仍復相抵、因散戶賣出比較為多、市價仍屬疲羅、午後丙種除中籤開盤為五元八角、中籤權利除八角、此後又平定無升降、買進已無鉅量、而賣方亦已縮手、雖聯益·信孚·聯和·樂茂·及上四號仍有買進、而生大·協大·胡鶴記·又有供給、怡泰並有轉賣、行市比上午稍緊、結果除丙種因除中籤關係不計外、餘則高低互見、為數衹五分一角至二角而已、成交總數共計約一百八十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣股三百股、價為八元正、</p>
<p>倫敦八日（週二）電、今日中國外債及英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、仍告平滯、銀行股上落參見、麥加利銀行股跌一先令三便士、價爲八鎊十六先令三便士、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股回升半鎊、價爲七十五鎊、又香港註冊股昨電爲七十一鎊半、係七十八鎊半之誤、比前升半鎊、今日仍站原盤、行情有行無市、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布漲勢列烈　粵港仍有採辦　囤戶吸收踴躍</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市漲勢轉劇、乃因粵港幫仍有大量採辦、囤戶吸收尤見踴躍、售盤猛漲、白貨粗布漲五角至一元、細布斜紋色布漲一元左右、漂布漲二角半至五角、深色細紗綫織品嗶嘰·直貢等貨、每疋漲一元至一元半、本街成交大旺、綜計近千件、粵港幫辦綫呢嗶嘰等五百餘件、浙閩幫辦藍布元斜粗布等貨三百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　昨以實銷續旺、業內外囤戶加碼、漲風殊烈、白貨龍頭細布後市最高盤售開五十二元二角半、嗣以散戶獲利轉賣、回降至五十一元六角、而細斜甚堅昂、每疋較漲一元以上、色貨四君子嗶嘰收盤時一元五角五分七釐半、</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖囤戶吸收　粗車白價俱昂</h3>
<p>昨糖市因囤戶復有吸收、價乃續緊、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白八十八元五角至七角、升元許、四月二十日打單初為八十九元、後回鬆為八十八元六角、收盤復升至八十九元四角、前後升一元三角、太古車白B嘜八下九元、亦升一元、餘未做出、市勢堅緊、</p>
<h3>南北貨　海南圓肉續漲</h3>
<p>海南圓內、自步漲以來、行方均擬備些、而號方手貨已稀、不肯輕放、致驟呈求過於供之象、昨聞續有開出數十件、比前又抬起十元之譜、號方雖再叫升、但漲勢過速、暫觀穩定云、</p>
<h3>金菜至貨無繼　售盤開升十元</h3>
<p>金針菜因到貨無繼、市存日缺、故趨勢步升、而項莊菜更為寥寥、故行盤叫一百八十元、昨鄉莊菜稍有開出、價為一百六十元、升起十元、市價雖達高峯、但仍乏鬆象、</p>
<h3>絲茶　美國生絲存量又減</h3>
<p>嗣後價格可能步漲</p>
<p>據紐約路透電報告、三月份美國生絲進口二萬一千六百二十六包、較上月增加二千八百四十二包、消費總額二萬五千八百二十八包、存底四萬九千九百零四包、較上月皆有減少、</p>
<p>綜觀以上報告、窺得此後生絲價格、可能步漲、以美之生絲進口說、自歐戰爆發以來、歐絲輸美、已完全斷絕、即其他各國之絲運、亦因戰爭而受影響、雖三月份進口總額較前稍有增加、但其消費已超過進口額、即消費與進口已失去其平衡、故目前若無大量進口來彌補引大量消費、則存底將日見減少、且看三月份存底已較上月減少四千四百零二包、由此推測、美國目前生絲之需要甚為殷切、以及市場求過於供之現象、影響到絲價前途、愈能抬高、</p>
<h3>海味　茴香叫升五十元</h3>
<p>茴午因產價滙水關係、合劃申市成本日增、故趨勢甚緊、昨行盤野叫三百五十元、查前盤為三百元、雖未成交、然後市步緊之局、已灼然可見、</p>

<h3>虹口楊樹浦路　兩日兵遭槍殺　兩兵當場斃命兇手逃逸　事後大施搜查並無所得</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（九日）午前、滬東楊樹浦區又有日憲兵兩名遭暗殺、兇手係兩華人、今日午前十一時半在大連灣路楊樹浦路口、用手槍向該區日憲兵隊吉田與小島兩伍長開槍數響、然後沿榆林路逸去、吉田頭中兩彈、小島胸中兩彈、均倒地頓時畢命、</p>
<p>日擊行凶</p>
<p>某外僑目擊其事、乃向警方與日當局報告出事情形、據該外僑聲稱、兇手開槍後、立刻飛奔逸去、兩日兵　中彈踣地、當場氣絕、本市日軍當局正式披露、該兩日兵今晨在大連灣路與麥克裡路附近堆銅之棧房前駐守、旋赴楊樹浦路日憲兵營、途路遇刺、事出不意、未及還擊、即已中彈倒地、數分鍾內斃命、</p>

<h3>煤球廠停供現貨　造成燃料恐慌　囤積棧單者又暗中操縱　與煤球廠互相提高盤價</h3>
<p>近兩週來、煤球售價狂漲一倍、影響於市民者經依法選出或推甚鉅、據上海市煤炭柴號同業聯合會稱、此次煤球再度狂漲原因、實為煤球廠停止現批、衹供棧單提取所造成、蓋各廠煤球、大部供燃料零售商之日銷、廠方停止現批、零售商無貨應市、必須向市場收買棧單、囤積棧單者、乃抬高價格、廠盤亦隨之再增、以相互造成恐慌之局面、該會昨陳當局、要求迅　糾正、茲錄其致工部局政治部及何德奎氏之原函如下、</p>
<p>煤號發貨　掯不發給</p>
<p>「謹啟者、案撥會員大中國煤號等聯名函稱、邇來煤球漲價聲中、煤球廠出品、專給棧單提取、對吾同業各零售店需煤球、停止供給現貨、茍欲批得煤球、必依市場暗盤購得棧單、迨購得棧單、到廠出貨時、廠方又故意遲延發貨、或衹發每噸四分之一、而延期之棧租、則十足照算、以致無貨應市者、紛紛停業、痛苦難言、又平時各廠兼營零賣、逾越範圍、妨礙零售同業之生計、上述諸點、實於同業生計攸關、應請即日設法交涉、以安營業、等情前來、據此、查近日各煤球廠登報限期出清煤球棧單、而對各另售店停止現批之供給、囤積棧單者更暗底操縱、抬成高價、然後廠盤亦隨之再增、以相互造成恐慌之局面、按之上年春間燃料恐慌之情形、如出一轍、</p>
<p>囤戶棧單又復抬價</p>

<h3>修學講座　什麼樣預備日常功課（三）</h3>
<p>— 盧紹稷</p>
<p>四·教師應負的責任</p>
<p>誠如開頭所說、現今青年舉生功課繁重、則教師對其學習非加以輔導不可、輔導事項、約如左列、</p>
<p>（一）設置優良的自學環境　學生自修室的光線溫度和設備、都須極其適宜、即學生用的重要工具、如字典·辭書·目錄索引以及各種掛圖標本等、也當盡量佈置、使環境學術化、</p>
<p>（二）须教學生讀書的方法　讀書分朗讀默讀、又分精讀略讀、各有適當的方法、在此不必細說、學生所急欲知道的、　什樣讀教科書、讀時見到重要部分、可在句語下畫線、或在書的邊眉做僩注意記號、或　用書頁的邊眉、寫批語、寫摘要、寫參考書目、寫問題、最好在讀的時候、凡遇重要部分都寫出一個問句、如同考試題目、一程讀完後、將所寫的題目、自己去考試自己，能否瞭解、易於知道、　什樣找參考材料、如辭典百科全書等、應什樣用法、　什樣做筆記、筆記格式的詳略及其他應注意的地方、教師們都要詳細地先對學生講個清楚、</p>
<p>（三）須使學生十分明瞭指定的功課　學生既有優良的自學環境、又能知道讀書的方法、於是教師可指定功課給他們預習了、但指定預習的功課、要使學生十分明瞭、且能引起他們的舆趣、指定功課的方式、有寫某書由某頁起至某頁止的、是以頁篇本位、此外、有以章節為本位、或以問題為本位的、指定時須注意之點、A使學生對於何處起至何處止、能十分明瞭、教師最好將功課大　作一簡單的介紹、更能引起他們學習的興趣、B功課分量、應適合各人的能力、C指定時、應注意偶然發生的事項、不必一定照課本裹面的次序、D指定功課的時間、以在上課時間較好、學生易注意、倘在將下課時、大家都疲倦、要一二分鍾去抄寫、有時都覺得討厭哩、</p>
<p>（四）須考查學生預習的成績　學生預習功課、有的很用功、有的很懒惰、其預習成績的好壞、非加以考查不可、考查的方法、可依據學生預習的筆記、或依據口試、或舉行演講和小辯論、總以能證明既達到预習的最低限度為主、</p>
<p>以上幾點、對學生預習日常功課很有幫助、作者　希望教師們能負這輔導的責任（完）</p>

<h3>蛋與石</h3>
<p>— 小姑</p>
<p>靑年的然情，有時候是够驚人的。他們的嫉惡如仇的心，有時候甚至使他們以脆弱似蛋的力量，去與堅硬如石的惡勢力對抗。以蛋擊石，結果的悲慘是可想而知的。他們的熱情是可敬佩的，可是他們的缺少經騐的行動，有時候却是愚不可及的。</p>
<p>我們應該使現代的靑年聰明一點。</p>
<p>惡勢力是要反對的，可是我們却不能不環顧週遭的環境，貿然地躍躍欲試。靑年們應該有瞻前顧伐的智慧，應該有培植力量的堅忍，應該有察看機會的眼光。不斷的鍛鍊，可使脆弱的蛋成爲摧枯拉朽的鐵彈：風雨的摧殘，能使堅硬的石頭瓦解崩裂。與其以蛋　石，不如以彈擊石。</p>
<p>瞻前顧後，並不是　趄不前，培養實力，並不是避重就輕；察看機會，並不是逃避現實。</p>
<p>靑年應該避免的是無謂的犧牲，應該善用的是他們的熱情。</p>
<p>以蛋擊石，不如以彈　石！</p>

<h3>他情願在家裏餓死</h3>
<p>— 待明</p>
<p>不知是那一天的下午，我那弟弟哭喪着臉地又回家了。我覺得很奇怪。但是，母親已經開始在問話了：</p>
<p>『你爲甚麼突然又回家呢？』</p>
<p>『我情願在家裏餓死；再也不願幹下去了。』弟弟直截地說：『媽！你要知道，在那邊眞是在活受罪。一天沒有好好的三餐。一天亮就要起來工作；直到晚上打烊後方才可以息息。但是老　還在駡着你。甚麼百把塊錢一擔米。……。只會吃，不會做。……。店多要吃窮了。……。有時還要雜着幾句難聽的話。在日裏，甚麽工作多做：倒痰盂，抱小孩，燒飯，照顧客人。……。一偶不留神，老闆手裏的皮鞭，便會無情地抽在你身上。媽！你不信，看看我的身上。這是昨天的新創痰。爲的是在燒飯時，那五歲的小老闆同鄰家的孩子去玩了。不知怎樣一來，二人打了起來。吃了虧，回家吿訴老闆娘。老闆娘順手就拿起柴來，狠命地打我。說我有意叫小老闆出去給人家打死。媽，你想她狠心不狠心？媽！您捨得您未成年的孩子，吃那麽大的苦嗎？媽！我求您不要叫我再去吧！媽！我今天偷偷地溜出來；假使再回去必定又是一頓毒打。媽！您做做好事吧！』弟弟在向母親哀求了。同時眼淚像珍珠般，一串串地向下掛。</p>
<p>母親的嘴脣動了一下。大概是答應了吧？但是沒答出聲來。立刻，扭轉了頭，目光射在牆隅竹椅上的父親。好似在問：『你看怎麽樣？』</p>
<p>父親的臉，突然威嚴了，但是他內心的苦痛，悲哀，在他那無情的話和顫抖的聲音裹很可以表示出來。</p>
<p>『你道樣就算苦了嗎？　，那，你一定是個沒出息的東西。你看自古以來的英雄豪傑，那一個不是從苦中生長出來的？岳飛，歐陽修的幼年生活，你大概是知道的吧。「吃得苦中苦，方為人上人」的古訓，你也懂得的吧？』父親顯然是不答應了。同時開始在敎訓弟弟：</p>
<p>『你知道現在家裏，連粥都吃小飽。你現在憑一時之血氣；說餓死也願意在家裏。但是，等你嘗到眞正的餓，你方才知道餓的可怕，而父想出去工作了。但是，那時候又到那處去呢？你要知道，工作並不在等待你呀！所以我現在叫你去！叫你立刻就去！去也得去；不去也得去！』未幾句話格外的重。嚇得弟弟楞住在一邊，做聲不得。我知道這幾句話，一定又會把弟弟的心綁到刑塲上去。他是受傷了！呀！可憐的弟弟，你受了外傷不够；還要受內傷。不過，我希望你切記着受創的原因。</p>
<p>母親已被這幾句話打消了她的初衷。她現在開始勸弟弟去工作了。但是，她的聲音是怎樣地低。連我都沒有聽得到。不過，我知道，她一定是在把父親的話，反覆在解釋着。而且，把將來的幸福，利祿，引誘弟弟去到火坑。</p>
<p>弟弟還小肯立起身米。我知道父親的脾氣。我知道，這種舉動，會昇起父親的怒火。說不定會有总外的舉動。那麽，弟弟所受的苦痛，必將較前更大。於是我不得不違背了天良，而隨着勸導弟弟；叫他忍耐一下。我答應隨時替他設法。但是，我自己知道；這不過是泡影吧了！</p>
<p>弟弟知道家裏是不容他了，只得沒奈何地立　身來，慢吞吞地走向來路。我目送弟弟的背影出了大門，不覺深深地嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>母親已嚶嚶　在哭泣了，父親的臉發着白。坐在竹椅上一聲都不響。好久好久，才嘆了口氣。並且眼睛也有點兒紅了。我知道父親剛才的舉動，也是違背了他的本心。但是還有甚麼更好的辦法呢？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（六）愛情結晶品</p>
<p>「這個方法很好，過幾天就讓我自己下鄉去走一次。」秋海棠不住的點着腦袋說。</p>
<p>湘綺不就說什麼，先把身子一轉，換了一個方向，改為背對着窗，臉對着那兩扇暢開着的小門。這幾天，門外面掛上布簾了，那是灰綠色的土布做的，兩層布的中間，還夾着一些薄棉，上下各釘兩條寸許闊的橫木，壓住了簾脚，不使它給風吹起來；式樣不但已經陳舊，便是布的顏色，也顯得很黯淡了。</p>
<p>「你自己去實在不大好，」湘綺沈吟着說：「常常離開北京，你手下那些人要覺得奇怪了；可是突然把許多錢寄到鄕下去也不大妥當，最好還是你先寄二三十塊錢回去，請你叔父當盤緾，讓他自己上你那兒來商量…—。」</p>
<p>她的話還沒有說完，突然一陣登登的脚步響，那個啞丫頭已拉開門簾走了進來。</p>
<p>「啊……啊……呀……—」她堆着一臉很天眞的笑，一進房便指手劃脚的向湘綺做起手勢來了，喉管裏還勉强發出一種咿咿呀呀的聲音</p>
<p>湘綺和他在一起過日子，自己差不多也就成了啞叭，做手勢，看手勢，在她已比說話還容易了。</p>
<p>「她說煤舖子裏把兩籮煤送來了，叫我們到外面去看一看，把錢付給他們。」她笑着給茫無頭緒的秋海棠解釋。</p>
<p>秋海棠也不由笑了，無論他怎樣聰明，也想不到那個啞丫頭所做的幾個手勢之中，竟會包含着這許多意義。</p>
<p>「這樣說，她的做工簡直要比我們唱戲的還細膩咧！」他一面跟他們走出房去，一面這樣打趣着說。</p>
<p>湘綺却沒有聽見，她正和那小丫頭並着肩在前面走，一路互打手勢，一路穿過院子去；秋海棠便隨手在堂屋裹的餐桌上檢起了一份當天的天津商報來，捧在手裏，胡亂翻看着。</p>

<h3>我有一個母親</h3>
<p>— 陳瑚萍</p>
<p>我有一個母親，但我得不到一點母愛。為了同情，同時也為了我的良心，我犧牲了人們所謂最偉大的母愛。我今年已在高三讀書，但是明年畢業後，是吾繼續升學，還屬問題。因為母親在父親前極力的摧毀我的前途。</p>
<p>家中除了父母及七個弟妹外，還有一個年老的祖母及柔弱的姑母。家中生活，全賴父親一人維持，這點引起了母親的驕傲，擴大母親的勢力。祖母與姑母的一切完全操在她掌中。首先，斷絕了她們經濟的來源，姑母的求學也就停止。其决，在父親面前毀謗進讒。父親雖是個孝子，但是愛妻子之心，却戰勝了他的孝心。幾個弟妹不用說，當然是批助紂爲惡附炎趨勢者。察得一點言語，便去報吿母親。如果我與母親同站一條戰綫上那我將成爲她的寵愛女兄，物質上的享受，也會較現在勝過幾倍。但是天啊！我怎　昧着良心去對日薄西山的祖母及孤苦伶仃的姑母再加以摧殘呢？我同情她們的處境，憐恤她們的無能。我不願為討得母親的歡心，而向她們進攻。母親常常自嘆說，她白養了一個女兒，沾不着一點元。從此對我漸漸疏淡下來，時常為了一些小事，便將我肆駡。我的脾氣生來是倔强萬分的，以致言語間得罪了母親。於是一個『不孝』的罪名，又加到我的頭上了。父親本來是極愛我的，現在聽了母親的言語，也對我漸漸灰心失望。所以如今我是一個失了父寵母愛的孩子。</p>
<p>我在暗暗替母親擔心着，因爲她將來也要與兒媳們一同居住，靠着兒子過活的啊。</p>

<h3>「血淚相思」</h3>
<p>— 鄧士英</p>
<p>爲看戲而看歌唱片，那多半會失望的。作者一方面得顧到戲，一方面却又不能不盡量「插」進歌唱，於是乎，顧此失彼，結果便犧牲了戲，甚至，駝子跌觔斗，兩頭不着實，使觀衆一無所獲。像「　地笙歌」「桃花恨」這類片子，那在歌唱片中是百不得一的，其原因，除歌的本身動聽之外，所挿的歌比較少也是一個。</p>
<p>「而淚相思」　說楚珍妮麥唐納和納爾遜埃第最後合作的片子，是五彩片，又是「戲劇大師諾爾考華特編劇作曲塡詞三部曲一，不過我對這個戲却並不感到興趣：「血淚相思」中所挿的歌是有十一支之多，可是使我留有印象的，祇有I’llSee　you　again這種耗費在歌唱上的膠片限止了戲劇塲面的發展，把很多的戲都成為過塲，道是一·第二，在故事上說，一個少女拋棄了她安樂的生活和金龜壻，跟隨了窮音樂敎師私奔，過着「心境恬適而貧苦不堪」的生活，甚至淪為街頭賣唱者；這一切應該是很好的戲劇村料，可是我們在塲面及色彩上所看到的，却都太嫌富麗和溫暖，於是乎，原來的那種苦中之樂的情趣便被破壞了，連最後的「嗣後莎拉每歌此曲，似與卡爾相偕之」，也减弱了共嗚。</p>
<p>珍妮麥唐納在戲裏換了好幾　時裝，這些時裝顏色固然鮮艷，式樣也很好，可是和劇情配起來，却就格格不入了。這或者是和導演一樣，是五彩片害了她，以為非富麗堂皇不足以顯五彩的特長，可是却沒有想到，「血淚相思」在色彩上給人好感的，却是從最後的用單純的棕色上演卡爾的遺作那塲戲上開始的。</p>
<p>談到演技，麥唐納的戲靜的比動的好，例如在小酒店裏那塲戲，我們便覺得麥唐納連唱帶做，不够狂放，反之，她在排練她丈夫遺作那塲戲上，站在鋼琴邊上情不由已的哭出聲來，由亟力壓制情感而終於爆發，却好得多了。納爾遜埃第還是老樣，是一個歌唱家，我們很難有機會看得他有戲。</p>
<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第五章　紅裙煞妒石榴花</p>
<p>佟天豹一見李信，　向他一揖道：「李公子別來無恙。俺妹妹得罪了你，請你不要見怪。」李信聽了這話，不由臉上一紅，說道：「這是我李某的本領不濟事，以致於此。今日我已被擒，你們要殺便殺，不必多言。」佟天豹哈哈笑了一聲，拖過一張櫈子，在李信對面坐下。把手一摸自己的下頜，父說道：「李公子，不要說這種氣話。俺們兄妹倆對於李公子聞名巳久，抱着十二分的誠意，所以前决俺們兄妹為要借重公子大名，一同起義，特地改扮了江湖賣解之流，到杞縣去乘機拜謁公子，將俺們的意思吿訴於你。誰知公子不能接受俺們的話，使俺們白跑一趟。然而俺妹妹始終不能忘情於公子，因此今番帶了山上弟兄來攻杞縣，目的也無非要得公子。果然俺妹妹巳把公子請來，徼倖得很。現在要請公子屈居於此，共圖大事，希望公子不要再推辭了，並且俺還有一件冒昧的事，也要請公子答應的，就是俺的妹妹天鳳今年巳有十九歲了，還沒有和人家定過親。伊的武藝很是高强，馬上步下都來得，自比於化木蘭梁紅玉一流人物。因為伊生來喜歡紅的東西，常戴紅的花，穿紅的衣裙，紅的鞋兒，搽紅的脂胭，坐紅的馬，遂得了一個別號，喚做「紅娘子」，這三個字在黃河兩岸，是到處聞名的，這樣可以知道伊不是尋常的女子了。所以伊想嫁一個英雄豪傑，不至辱沒了伊的一生。李公子文武雙全，任俠仗義，是今世的孟嘗平原，俺妹妹願意奉侍巾櫛，俺們李佟二家結一個朱陳之好；這兩件事要請公子允諾，休得推辭。」佟天豹說完了，义着兩手，靜候李信回答。李信聽了，方知自己所以被擒，完全是出於紅娘子的用意，無怪他們把自己如此優待了。然而自己豈肯屈身為賊呢？（三四）</p>

<h3>將演「回春之曲」</h3>
<p>— 守蕪</p>
<p>金燄王人美夫婦在重慶拍完了孫瑜的「長空　里」回港之後，一直到現在閑空着。最近，消息傳來，他倆將主演「回春之曲」了。</p>
<p>「回春之曲」是田漢編制的，這個戲七八年前在金城大戲院用美餘劇人協會名義演出的時候，聲勢之盛，到現在為止，不僅是空前，也可說是絕後，舉凡今日國內享着盛名的紅電影小生，差不多都網羅在內，中國話劇運動之有今日之蓬勃者，這一次演出實在有莫大的功績。</p>
<p>現在這個名著一時的舞臺劇將由杳港新生公司搬上銀幕了。在舞臺上，「回春之曲」的主演者是金燄和王人美夫婦，現在趁他們在港的機會，銀幕上的主角便也就決定請他們兩位來担任，導演者則已內定為司徒慧敏。司徒慧敏本來是決定導演「祖國之戀」的，現在已經讓給譚友六了。至於蔡楚生編導的「新生」，則大概要等這兩組戲開拍後再淮行。</p>
<p>「回春之曲」和「祖國之戀」都是寫的華僑生活，所以外景隊將到馬尼拉或到新加坡去實地拍攝，以求眞實云。</p>
<h3>美政府發展南美文化</h3>

<p>美國政府發展對南美各國文化上和商業上聯繫的國策，從各方面推行不遺餘力。近派掌理電影事業的政府大員惠特納親赴好萊塢，目的便是設法藉電影來協助這種聯繫的發展</p>
<p>各大影片公司遵從政府意志，乃在這方面分頭努力。如「時代的進展」和「百代新聞」短片攝影師已決定攝製以南美爲背景的短片多本；派拉蒙公司也派攝影師亞萊遄赴南美攝取新聞（一九三七年日機轟炸長江中美砲艦潘南號時，亞萊曾攝下其經過）。</p>
<p>此外，各影片公司並將競攝以中美與南美為題材的長片，隨時派隊前往實地攝取外景，同時並請各大明星同行，以資聯絡。關於這一點，聽說傑姆士羅斯福（美總統　斯福的公子）所監製的第一部影片“Pot　O’Gold”或將在墨西哥京城作全世界的首先公映，而請好萊塢影界人士同赴墨西哥京城參加該片的公映盛會。</p>
<h3>劇藝新聞</h3>

<p>上海伶界聯合會保產審查委員會已將梨園坊全部房產贖回，現在繼續辦理平糶，不久要演唱一决義務戲，也許會將話劇的「家」演出，但還未曾確定。本來，伶界聯合會的四行小組會，爲了酬勞保產會的出力人員，預備舉行一决慶功宴，可是周信芳，高百歲等都表示不必多此一舉，希望能够撥「歡宴」的款子，捐助辦理平糶。小組會對於這個提議，巳表贊同，並且撥了一千塊錢給保產會，這是贖回梨園坊後的又一德政。</p>
<p>文武老生劉文魁，脫離天蟾舞臺　，就受先施樂園平劇塲的邀聘，和坤旦張慧聰同時加入。最近慧聰因懷孕吿假，文魁也感到在遊藝塲搭班有英雄難用武之慨，就向當局辭班，準定演到本月底止，昨天巳被更新邀妥，在二本「新西遊記」加人。</p>

<h3>The Balkan War Situation Takes a Sharp Turn: German Troops Enter Salonika; Greek Forces in Eastern Macedonia Are Isolated; Troops Invading Southern Yugoslavia Occupy Skopje; German-Turkish Relations: A Non-Aggression Pact Is Possible</h3>
<p>Ankara: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam is to deliver a statement today concerning the Balkan situation at the National Assembly. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>Bern: A Berlin correspondent for the "Lausanne Gazette" reports that there is at least the possibility of Germany and Turkey signing a non-aggression pact. German political and military circles are closely watching all news from the Turkish capital, especially the talks between German Ambassador von Papen and Turkish authorities. Although most people are unwilling to comment extensively, it is generally believed that current German-Turkish relations are very normal. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible sources, German troops entered Salonika at 4:00 AM today. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a special communiqué this afternoon stating that elite German troops have occupied Salonika from the south of Yugoslavia. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A communiqué from the German High Command stated that Greek forces in the area east of the Vardar River have now surrendered. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon's German war report stated that infantry and mechanized units led by General List, departing from Bulgaria, broke through Yugoslav border defenses and advanced over one hundred kilometers into the Skopje basin. They have also crossed the Vardar River, thus completing the task of cutting off communication between Yugoslav troops and British-Greek forces. Other German troops crossed Lake Doiran and entered Greek territory. In southern Serbia, German troops captured approximately 20,000 Yugoslav soldiers, including six generals. On the Greek front, infantry and mountain troops under the command of General List broke through a section of the "Metaxas Line." (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>London: According to sources here, German troops advancing along the Vardar River have reached Salonika and cut off the lines of communication between eastern Macedonia and other Greek forces. Yugoslav troops are currently retreating in the southern part of the country. German troops advancing from Romania are reported to have arrived at Skopje, an important railway junction in the northern part of the Vardar River valley. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek military authorities have announced that due to the powerful German mechanized forces and war machine attacking Salonika from Yugoslavia, Greek forces in eastern Macedonia have been isolated and separated from other Greek forces. Greek troops bravely fought last night to resist the German mechanized divisions advancing like a whirlwind sweeping fallen leaves from the collapsing Yugoslav front into Greece. According to an official communiqué, after capturing the southwestern Yugoslav border city of Gevgelija, German troops advanced directly into Greek territory, attacking Salonika. Communication between the Greek forces in eastern Macedonia and the rest of the country has been severed. Officials believe the German attack on Salonika was due to the collapse of the southern Serbian front, which exposed the Greek left flank to attack by modern mechanized forces. The communiqué continued, "Although German forces are exerting significant pressure on western Thrace and Macedonia, the enemy has not yet achieved its objectives. Seventy German paratroopers who landed behind our lines have been captured, and many others have been annihilated." The communiqué also stated that the Pasuhuali fort on the Nivilok Plateau, which had been occupied by German forces, has been recaptured by Greek forces. Greek forces have also retaken recently occupied enemy positions in the same area. The fighting on the Greek-Bulgarian border is very intense. After Greek forces, with a small number of troops, recaptured several fortresses occupied by German forces on Monday, they have now retreated. Greek troops are currently exerting all their strength to contain the furious mechanized attacks, and it is reported that in several locations, thanks to the desperate sacrifices of soldiers, they have had considerable success. It is reported that the main Greek forces have concentrated all available troops and supplies to form an effective new defensive line west of Salonika. Due to the retreat from eastern and western Thrace, German forces have been able to reach the Aegean Sea. However, for several weeks, it has been expected that the Greek retreat from Thrace was part of their strategy. Greek forces may retreat from other coastal areas if necessary. According to a Greek government spokesman, fierce fighting is currently continuing along the Struma River east of Salonika, where German troops have not only been repelled but also scattered.

<h3>London Observers Comment on the War Situation: Turkey's Attitude Worth Watching</h3>
<p>London: Sources here emphasize that Salonika no longer possesses the military importance it had during the last World War. According to British military sources, judging from the general deployment of Allied forces, it can be asserted that the center of military gravity is located far from Salonika. Although 40,000 to 60,000 British troops gathered around Katerini southwest of Salonika last Sunday, it is currently unknown whether British troops have made contact with German troops. An Ankara report stated that the Turkish cabinet convened yesterday to discuss the new situation arising from the Greek withdrawal from eastern Thrace, and the Chief of Staff was also in attendance. It is reported that Turkey is closely monitoring the actions of Bulgarian troops, and it is rumored that several thousand Bulgarian troops have concentrated on the Turkish border. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Balkan War and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The Balkan War has been underway for four days. While the intensity of the German offensive is clearly less than that of the Western Front campaign last spring, it cannot be denied that it may achieve some progress under its intense attacks. It is difficult for Allied forces to defend the narrow coastal strip of eastern Thrace and Salonika, and they may have to abandon some positions to accommodate strategic maneuvering. This news may disappoint those who eagerly desire an Allied victory, but there is actually no reason for discouragement. The expansion of the Balkan War is fundamentally a result of the Nazis being forced to militarily compensate for the failure of their political offensive. Even if they gain only the occupation of certain areas, they must tie down a large number of troops and attention in this corner, and their supply of oil and food in the rear will suffer significant damage as a result. Compared with the gains, it is far from sufficient to compensate. Moreover, if the German forces cannot quickly end this war with a blitzkrieg, then their attempt to attack Britain will be even more difficult to carry out.</p>
<p>The future of the Balkan War depends not only on the fierce fighting between the two sides, but even more on how various related international factors develop. For example, what reaction Turkey will have to the war approaching the straits, and whether American aid to Britain, Greece, and Yugoslavia can arrive in time, all have a major determining effect. How the Soviet Union will cope with and handle itself under this new situation is even more of a matter of global attention. According to past tradition, although Soviet diplomacy has had a mysterious aspect, the basic points of its policies have always been declared externally. However, since the formation of the Tripartite Pact, the Soviet Union has suddenly become silent and obscure, rarely publicly announcing its foreign policy, even at the recent Supreme Soviet assembly. It is undeniable that something is brewing in this silence. The relations between the Soviet Union and Germany, however, have been constantly hindered by many subtle disputes. From the Danube River navigation issue to the recent signing of the Soviet-Yugoslav agreement, it can be seen that the harmony between the two countries has gradually been overshadowed by some shadows. On the Nazi side, while they have made considerable efforts to avoid stimulating Soviet sentiments in their management of the Danube River basin and the Balkans, it is in fact an irreconcilable contradiction. Moreover, the Soviet Union's statement regarding Bulgaria's participation in the Axis, and the indirect warnings given to Germany through the non-aggression treaties with Turkey and Yugoslavia, have not been respected by Germany. After the expansion of the Balkan War, the Soviet Union's desire to maintain peace in that region has become a bubble. The German occupation of eastern Thrace has little impact on Britain for the time being, but it directly endangers Turkey and indirectly threatens the Soviet Union. The current situation between the Soviet Union and Germany is reminiscent of the situation after the German occupation of Poland the previous year. On the Black Sea coast, there are no neutral countries like Finland and the three Baltic states that the Soviet Union can use to leisurely strengthen its national defense. If the current situation continues to develop, it will inevitably lead to the surfacing of the opposition between the two countries. The rumor circulating in London that a conflict will occur between the Soviet Union and Germany may not yet be something that the Moscow authorities are willing to publicly acknowledge, but in fact, it is an inevitable trend.</p>
<p>Just as the European war is gradually spreading towards the Soviet border, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka happened to be returning from Berlin via Moscow, conducting diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet authorities for several days. Judging from the length of his stay, Matsuoka may feel more interested in this negotiation than in his social interactions in Berlin and Rome, hoping that a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact can be concluded as a result of this trip. In theory, the Soviet Union must now pay close attention to the development of the Balkan situation, and cannot but hope that the eastern border is safe, similar to the situation before the outbreak of the European war when it established the Nomonhan ceasefire agreement with Japan. Moreover, since the Soviet Union has non-aggression treaties with both Germany and Yugoslavia, which are belligerent countries in Europe, it is not impossible to grant Japan the same agreement, similar to the agreement relationship it already has with China. Matsuoka probably decided to stop in Moscow to avoid a futile trip to Europe because of these connections. However, upon closer examination, it is not difficult to discover that if a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact is concluded, although it does not violate the Soviet Union's consistent position, its consequences are quite different from other similar agreements. The previous Soviet-Chinese, Soviet-German, Soviet-Turkish, and Soviet-Yugoslav agreements have all contributed to the Soviet Union's security and national defense. This effect, however, cannot be obtained from the same agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan. Moreover, Japan's eagerness to conclude this agreement is nothing more than to facilitate its southern advance, so as to echo the German offensive in the Balkans. The result will naturally be to further enhance Nazi arrogance and momentum. Even if the hope of advancing south may not be easily achieved, it will also tie down some of the strength of Britain and the United States, affecting the Allied resistance to Germany. All of this is contrary to the Soviet Union's own interests. On the other hand, this agreement is given the highest value by Japan, but it remains questionable what rights and interests the Soviet Union can obtain in exchange. In the eyes of people like Matsuoka, they may be eager to achieve success and are willing to be generous and unsparing, but that is definitely not what the entire country of Japan wants to hear today. Given the sincerity and ingenuity of the Soviet authorities, they should not be unaware of this, right?</p>
<p>The European war has been going on for twenty months. In terms of Soviet diplomacy, the weakest link in the internal and external policies of democratic countries has always remained. The recent more active attitude of the Soviet Union was prompted not by democratic countries but by the Nazis. The joint military meeting of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India recently convened in the Far East is a wise measure to cope with future events, but what the Far East urgently needs at this moment is not just the joint defense between democratic countries, but also close cooperation between democratic countries and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Nazis Follow Former Strategies of Invading France; Greek Troops Demonstrate Extraordinary Courage in Resistance</h3>
<p>London: A dispatch from Athens from the Free French Agency reports that several hundred German soldiers, traveling in rubber boats, attempted to infiltrate along the Nestos River in Thrace, but were annihilated in the crisscrossing fire of Greek troops. In one day of fighting, the German advance was blocked, and Greek troops counterattacked in several locations. German troops attacked the Perithori fortress in shifts for six hours. The Greek troops defending the fortress resolutely resisted, fighting five against one. German troops once gained a foothold in the fortress, as announced by the Greek headquarters, but Greek troops quickly launched a fierce attack and drove the German troops out. German troops continued to attack the Rupel fortress three times, with the last attack being particularly fierce, but all were repelled. The German attack on the Roupel fortress was also repelled, destroying twelve German tanks and capturing several German soldiers. Elsewhere, German motorized units were cleared by Greek troops. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Athens: British and Greek troops retreated this morning due to being unable to withstand the intense artillery fire from German troops advancing along the Vardar River valley. According to official sources, British and Greek troops retreated to a location 23 miles from Salonika. This was affected by the disappearance of resistance from the Yugoslav troops on the Greek left flank. Senior commanders acknowledge the situation is very pessimistic. Greek troops in the north are forming new lines in the Vardar River valley, and elite troops are fiercely fighting to stop the German advance. A Greek spokesperson said that German troops charged forward with cannons, aircraft, and tanks, but were repelled by Greek troops taking advantage of the continuous fortresses defending Roupel. Fighting is currently ongoing and extremely fierce. It is claimed that Greek mountain troops yesterday used a strategy northeast of Komotini to surround a German mechanized unit, trapping them in a mountain gorge. It is reported that the German troops were immediately bombarded by Greek crossfire and eliminated. According to another report, elite Greek troops launched a counterattack in the Struma River valley, driving out German troops and recapturing previously lost fortified positions. According to reliable sources, British Royal Air Force fighters and bombers aided Greek troops in combat yesterday. Under the intense German offensive, Greek troops have strongly defended various mountain passes. The fortresses of Roupel and Oustai, which are currently strongly resisting the German attack, have formed a solid ring with sturdy fortifications. This is part of the Metaxas Line, defended by elite Greek troops, whose slogan is "Death Before Surrender." It is reported that British aircraft prevented German low-flying bombers from attacking the mountain fortresses throughout the day. Nazi troops are employing the old strategies of the French war, using aircraft to replace cannons and using tanks to clear obstacles and pave the way for infantry. The Greek communiqué declared that the retreat from western Thrace is not surprising, as Greece had drawn up a complete plan before the war began, and this is just a part of the plan. Although this move allowed German troops to gain a foothold in the Aegean Sea, it was enough to shorten the Greek front line. British troops in the Balkans have been greatly reinforced by tanks and other units. This reinforcement is preparing to fight a decisive battle with elite Nazi troops, as German troops are increasing their strength, attempting to break into the Aegean through the Macedonian Ridge. It is reported that the advance units of the Greek vanguard are engaging in heroic battles with German troops. Greek troops are using British heavy anti-aircraft guns, inflicting heavy losses on German divisions. It is said that these guns are extremely powerful in narrow mountain passes. It is also reported that German air raids cannot stop the continuous supply of British ammunition and supplies to the front line. British heavy artillery ammunition trucks and other supplies are transported to the front from various lines, forming long supply routes. Troops from various parts of the British Empire, including those from the British Isles, Australia, and New Zealand, were stationed in various strongholds yesterday. (United Press, 9th)</p>

Another British aircraft bombed the Gonayumaya railway station, causing a large fire. Road and highway intersections, motorized transport convoys, and concentrated enemy forces in Simitli were heavily attacked, with bombs exploding and catching fire. British aircraft also attacked Bitola, but the results could not be clearly seen due to smoke. Yesterday, British bombers, protected by fighters, attacked enemy motor transport forces concentrated near Strumica in harsh weather, hitting their targets. British fighters attacked and heavily damaged a German bomber. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Matsuoka Extends Stay in Soviet Union, Meets with US Ambassador in Moscow, Continues to Adopt a Wait-and-See Policy on the Overall Situation</h3>

<p>Berlin: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Matsuoka's stay was to discuss "Japanese affairs." Rumors that Matsuoka was a mediator between the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy were not true. (Haihan Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Policy of Supporting China Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Chongqing: In an editorial in the Central Daily News, sources here believe that Matsuoka's discussions with Soviet leaders in Moscow will not yield significant results. Matsuoka's trip to Germany is mainly aimed at exploring Germany's chances of victory against Britain. Whether Matsuoka's trip will result in Japan further strengthening its adherence to the Tripartite Pact, increasing pressure in the Pacific, or changing its policy to stabilize the tense situation in the Pacific, is still unknown. What can be predicted is that Japan will continue to adopt a wait-and-see policy. Matsuoka's four-day stay in Moscow and his statement that he would extend his stay if necessary indicate that Matsuoka attaches importance to his trip to Moscow, even more than to Berlin. However, there are still many outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union that need to be resolved. We believe that these issues cannot be resolved in a short period of time. Furthermore, we believe that even if the two sides agree on general principles, negotiations cannot proceed in the near future. Although we cannot say that Matsuoka's trip will have no effect, we dare to say that its effect will not be significant. An editorial in the Ta Kung Pao stated that the Soviet Union's attitude towards Japan is determined by the Soviet Union's fundamental interests. Before the Tripartite Pact, there was the Anti-Comintern Pact, the purpose of which was solely aimed at the Soviet Union. In the past twenty years, the Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy has been based on a friendly policy towards China. This is partly due to the activities of the Japanese and partly due to the traditional policy of the Soviet Union towards friendly relations with China established by Lenin. We firmly believe that Matsuoka's trip will not affect the Soviet Union's long-established policy towards China, and we dare to say that after Matsuoka returns to his country, the Japanese government will still not be able to discern the Soviet Union's true policy. We cannot predict with certainty. Our experience in dealing with Japan makes us deeply aware that Japan's desires have no end. Our experience is enough to serve as a warning to our Soviet friends.

<h3>British Newspaper Praises Quo Tai-chi, Says He Will Use Lessons Learned to Seek China's Welfare; Quo Delivered a Speech in London the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>London: The Manchester Guardian stated that diplomats with experience like the newly appointed Chinese Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Quo Tai-chi, are rare. The struggles and tragedies of Geneva, the devastation of China and Abyssinia, the arrogance of the Nazis, and the appeasement that led to a new war, all these events were witnessed by Ambassador Quo, and he can use these lessons to seek China's welfare. In the early days of Quo's tenure in the United Kingdom, he personally witnessed the ultimate failure of many illusions, but after residing in the United Kingdom for a long time, he finally saw the realization of a great hope, namely that the United Kingdom and the United States, although threatened, were able to unite and would not allow any retreat in the face of Japanese aggression. Quo will devote himself to China's unification, will maintain China's independence to resist any force and conspiracy, and will seek a situation in Chongqing and London where China and we can live peacefully. We are very fortunate to have Quo as the Ambassador to the United Kingdom. If his successor is Dr. Wellington Koo, then China will send one of its most prominent figures to London again. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London: Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Quo Tai-chi delivered a speech at a British banquet last night to raise funds for the Red Cross and Chinese war disaster relief. He stated that China and the United Kingdom have many things in common. The Chinese and British people are both regarded as difficult to fathom. The British are seen as insensitive, and the Chinese are seen as mysterious and incomprehensible. But when the two sides interact and get to know each other, they see that the response of benevolence is our main characteristic. Although some people say that the Chinese and British are the most self-sufficient people and the least willing to think that they can learn from others, there are indeed many things that China and the United Kingdom can learn from each other.

<h3>Manila Conference Concludes, British and Dutch Representatives Leave the Philippines Immediately; In Case of Alarm in the Pacific Situation, Britain Will Have a Strong Naval Reinforcement</h3>
<p>Manila: The United States High Commissioner to the Philippines, Francis B. Sayre, British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, Dutch Foreign Minister Eelco van Kleffens, and Dutch Colonial Minister Charles Welter, held a secret meeting this afternoon, lasting two hours. US Army Commander in the Philippines, Major General George Grunert, and Philippine Navy Commander-in-Chief, Rear Admiral Charles Bryant McVay III, also attended. US Asia Fleet Commander Admiral James O. Richardson was not in Manila due to exercises, so he did not participate. Sayre strongly stated the informal nature of the meeting. He said, "We discussed general matters." He pointed out that according to custom, the US High Commissioner to the Philippines would receive senior officials visiting the Philippines. Admiral Richardson's absence from the meeting was due to the weekly routine exercises of the Asia Fleet, and he had also met with British defense officials last week. In addition, former Foreign Minister Eelco van Kleffens was not familiar with the military issues of the former Dutch East Indies. Sources with access to information insisted that the meeting did not involve practical defense issues, but it did involve the situation in the Pacific. Dutch officials said that they had a pleasant discussion when they left the meeting at 6:30 PM this afternoon. They said they would not issue any statement, and those who participated in the meeting would not issue any statement about the meeting in the future.

<p>Singapore: British Commander-in-Chief of the China Fleet, Vice Admiral Sir Geoffrey Layton, told reporters today that if there is an alarm in the Pacific, then regardless of whether the United States joins us, we will be able to quickly obtain strong naval reinforcements. He added that he currently has not received and does not expect reinforcements for the fleet defending the eastern sea line and the bases of Hong Kong and Singapore. However, in the event of an emergency, a new fleet can arrive quickly and in time, and have sufficient strength to take effective defense actions, and a complete battleship fleet can also be opened to Singapore within two months. He also expressed his opinion that even if the Singapore base wanted to accommodate any part of the US fleet tomorrow, there would be no difficulty. This strong base has long been prepared as a supply, repair and combat base for the battleship fleet. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: At the second day of the meeting of the Japanese government officials, Interior Minister Hiranuma Kiichirō delivered a speech, saying that due to the United Kingdom and the United States intensifying the blockade and increasing aid to China, the situation in the Far East is very serious, and there is a possibility of a new crisis occurring at any time.

<h3>Sir Robert Brooke-Popham Discusses Hong Kong Defense</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: British Commander-in-Chief of the Far East, Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, flew to Manila on a Clipper this morning and will stay for a few days before returning to Singapore. Before leaving, he issued a statement to the press, saying that Hong Kong is not threatened by any party, and neither is Vladivostok. The only way for us to guarantee that Hong Kong will not be attacked is to make any attacker aware that the military price of this is too great. In Popham's statement, he first expressed satisfaction with Hong Kong's defense strength and urged every man and woman to fulfill their responsibilities in Hong Kong's defense, both actively and passively. Popham was very pleased with the cooperation between the military and civilian authorities and encouraged them to make all possible contributions to assist other parts of the Empire and the Allied countries. Popham then appealed to the people of Hong Kong to reduce the need for ship tonnage so that all ships could carry food and military supplies, etc., to all urgent needs. The document finally called on the British in Hong Kong to make full contributions to the war. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Wallace Insists That the United States Is Prepared for War; Warns Countries That Violate Treaties to Pay Attention to American Rights in All Areas</h3>
<p>New York: Vice President Henry A. Wallace (see picture) delivered one of the strongest anti-Axis speeches by a US official, saying that the United States is prepared for war if its rights are violated. The first task of the American people is to protect the democratic system, and the second task is to protect the principles of the Havana Conference. "After carefully considering the lessons of the last European war, the idea of maintaining peace cannot help but arise spontaneously, but at the same time, when we think of the ferocity of the aggressor countries, we also deeply feel that the greatest possibility of maintaining peace is to make the countries that violate treaties understand that the American people are prepared for war if American rights are violated in any area."

<h3>US Under Secretary of the Navy to Go to Britain Soon; To Seek Consistency in Naval Equipment</h3>
<p>Washington: US Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox announced that Under Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal will depart for Britain within half a month to establish close contact between the British and American naval departments on matters related to the Lend-Lease Act. The US Secretary of the Navy, in accordance with the Lend-Lease Act, is handling the procurement of materials in the United States for the British Navy and is undertaking the repair work of British warships. He is now quickly trying to establish considerable consistency in naval equipment. The purpose is to facilitate procurement and repair. It is said that one of the main purposes of Forrestal's trip to Britain is to investigate whether the British Navy can find ways to use more American naval equipment and other equipment that is different from the British Navy standard. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>US Huge Battleship Fleet in Service</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Daily News reported that the US Navy's most powerful battleship, the USS North Carolina (35,000 tons), was commissioned into the fleet at the Brooklyn Navy Yard today.

<h3>US Government Decides to Confiscate German and Italian Ships; Roosevelt Has Asked Congress for Authorization to Prepare to Purchase Danish Ships</h3>
<p>Washington: Roosevelt explained his attitude towards the Axis ships detained by the United States yesterday when he hosted news reporters. He said that he would ask Congress tomorrow to approve the authorization of the government to receive Danish ships in the United States. This action by the United States has received the tacit approval of the Danish Minister to the United States, Henrik Kauffmann. The envoy paid a visit to the White House yesterday morning. The US President dealt with the Axis ships and Danish ships under US custody separately. The thirty Axis ships can be received by means of confiscation, but the thirty-nine Danish ships should be purchased at a price. It seems that the President's intention is to think that the German and Italian ships can be taken into use, because some authorities recognize that the United States has the right to confiscate the Axis ships in the current limited state of emergency. The President also said that the US Treasury Department has allocated 180,000 yuan as the expenditure for purchasing national defense equipment and national defense construction in the first quarter of 1941. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Mexico City: Twelve Axis ships moored in Mexican ports were ordered to be purchased by President Manuel Ávila Camacho yesterday. The President said that the Mexican government will prepare funds to compensate Germany and Italy in order to permanently occupy these ships. The total number of Axis ships exceeds 65,000 tons. The Mexican government suddenly ordered the Navy Minister late last night to raise the Mexican flag on all Axis ships. According to the order, Mexico's reception of these ships is intended to "be used for coastal commercial transport," and it also stated that the diplomatic representatives of any warring countries whose ships are detained in our ports will be notified by our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is known that there are two German ships and nine Italian ships in Mexican ports. The twelfth ship was not mentioned. (International News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Australian Cabinet Meets; Acting Prime Minister Reaffirms Strong Determination to Fight</h3>

We do not underestimate the current fierce fighting. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>European War Discussions (43): Inside Germany During Wartime</h3>
<p>Furthermore, 200 train cars were required daily to transport coal through the Arlberg Pass to supply Italy. This alone presented a major problem for train transportation.</p>
<p>Each year, when winter ends and spring begins, the Danube River remains frozen, preventing oil tankers from navigating. This results in a severe shortage of oil tankers from Germany. According to Romanian kerosene experts, all of Germany's old oil tankers have already been put into service, continuously transporting production from the Ploiești oilfields to Germany. Soviet oil tankers have a wider gauge than those in Germany, making them unable to operate on German rails. The Germans must find a way to station numerous oil tankers at the border to transfer oil from the Soviet Union once it arrives. Generally, people do not believe that Germany obtained over one million tons of kerosene from Soviet Russia last year.</p>
<p>However, the Germans now project an image of abundant oil reserves. During the war, German oil magnate General Schörner boldly asserted that Germany would not face an oil shortage. Of course, his words were somewhat exaggerated. One noteworthy point is that when manufacturing aircraft, the engine design prioritizes the ability to burn synthetic gasoline refined from German-produced coal. Many German aircraft are already using this fuel. Unless the British Air Force destroys their major refineries, the supply of this fuel will not be interrupted. The British Air Force has bombed these locations more than once, including the main refinery in Lützkendorf, but as far as we know, the damage is not severe enough to affect its production. Furthermore, the government heavily restricts civilian gasoline consumption. Unless related to national affairs, civilians are not allowed to drive cars at will. Private cargo transport vehicles are also severely affected. Only a small number of stores can maintain delivery services. Only when purchasing large items such as pianos can stores provide delivery, otherwise, customers must carry their purchases home themselves.</p>
<p>The exact amount of oil the Germans seized in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Western France is unknown, but the quantity must be considerable. Last year, when I accompanied the German army through Belgium, I was amazed by the amount of gasoline left behind by the Allied forces without being burned. In Kortrijk, Belgium, alone, despite having ample time to destroy it, the Germans seized as much as 250,000 gallons of gasoline. When I left Berlin in December, gasoline was abundant in the city, more so than at any time since the start of the war. As a foreign news correspondent, I could purchase 37 gallons of gasoline each month, but a year earlier, I had to park my car because all the gas stations in Berlin were depleted. Last year, gas stations were filled with gasoline each quarter, and obtaining 37 gallons was, of course, no problem.</p>
<p>The person in charge of this large-scale, comprehensive war is Hitler alone. He acts unilaterally in everything, often disregarding the advice of high-ranking military officers. He is solitary and has no close friends. Since Röhm was killed during the purge in 1934, even Göring, Goebbels, or Hess do not dare to address Hitler as "you." His location is usually a military secret, never revealed. In the past, his attendants often "gave a wink" to foreign journalists, leaking information about his movements, such as when he planned to leave Berlin. Since the outbreak of the war, these people have kept silent. Before the war, one could tell if Hitler was in Berlin by looking at the flag on top of the Chancellery. Now, the head of the secret police, Himmler, always has that flag flying high on the roof of the Chancellery, regardless of whether the Führer is in Berlin or not. Newspapers also do not mention Hitler's whereabouts. Even American journalists were unable to find out in advance where Hitler planned to spend Christmas.</p>
<p>Hitler no longer often dines with his close associates. His companions are now limited to a few old friends from the early days of the party. These include Brückner, who once served as adjutant; Hess, who once served as his private secretary; Max Amann, his top sergeant from the last war and now the general manager of a German publishing company with huge assets, and others. These heads of the Nazi Party meet with Hitler by appointment, or the Führer invites them to watch private film screenings after dinner. Only these few people in Germany have seen the film "Gone with the Wind." Goebbels does not even want Nazi Party officials to watch this film, fearing that they will recall the "terrible" and costly films produced in Germany, causing unpleasant feelings.</p>
<p>In military affairs, Hitler wields supreme power. Army Commander-in-Chief General von Brauchitsch obeys the Führer's orders, and General Keitel's position between Hitler and the General Staff is only that of an intermediary. Chief of Staff Halder's achievements cannot be erased. The campaigns in Poland and the Western Front were all his brilliant feats. However, Hitler did not like him and did not award him the rank of general after the defeat of France. General Alfred Jodl is Hitler's personal chief of staff, but he is unknown, and few outside know of him.</p>
<p>Few Germans feel morally or conscientiously troubled by Hitler's aggression against other countries. They are also not very clear about the activities of the "Fifth Column." Although Germany has conquered Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Western France, the people are worried and deeply fear that they will rise up and avenge this hatred. A car mechanic in Berlin, who did not like Hitler, once said, "Even if you don't like Hitler, it is better to have him win the war. If we are defeated, Hitler and the Nazi Party are finished. We will be at the mercy of the Poles, Czechs, Norwegians, and Dutch. If they come to take revenge, we will have no chance. In other words, if we win, then we will be as prosperous as America." Goebbels also greatly promoted this point. Eighty million Germans hope for victory, even though the German army dug trenches and set up barbed wire along the English Channel last autumn to prevent British attacks. The Germans regret not having defeated Britain last autumn. But they still believe they can win. (The End)</p>

<h3>One Hundred British Planes Attack Kiel, Germany, Creating a Fiery Inferno; Thirty Thousand Incendiary Bombs Dropped; German Planes Attack the South Coast of England in Droves</h3>
<p>London: The British bombers dispatched to Germany on Sunday night to raid Kiel, Emden, and Wilhelmshaven were extremely powerful. Officials stated that they numbered several hundred, roughly equivalent to the number of German planes used to attack England. The weather was good that night, and the British bombers struck their targets with great success. German planes rose to resist but were mostly scattered by British fighters, a point that the Germans have already acknowledged. During the attack on Kiel, one square mile of the central area turned into a fiery inferno. Hundreds of tons of high-explosive bombs and 30,000 incendiary bombs were dropped. The number of bombs carried by British planes in previous attacks on Germany was the highest this time. Even from Heligoland, the flames of Kiel could be seen reaching the sky. At the time, the wind was strong, and the flames were even more intense. The fire department was unable to control the fire and could only let it burn. One pilot said, "The only way to extinguish the flames is to completely push the area into the sea." In the blazing light, the docks and shipyards were clearly visible. The submarine construction factory appeared to be heavily damaged. Kiel itself was also full of ruins, just like the docks. British planes arrived in multiple waves. The first wave had to penetrate a network of anti-aircraft fire to drop their bombs. Before long, thick smoke billowed up, obscuring the searchlights. The British planes continued their fierce attack. Although the defenses were extremely strong, they ultimately proved unable to resist. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Important Victories for British Forces in East Africa; Massawa Captured Yesterday; Remaining Enemy Around Addis Ababa Being Cleared; German-Italian Allied Forces Retake Derna in North Africa</h3>
<p>London: According to sources here, the port of Massawa on the Red Sea has been occupied by military forces. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent with the military reports that the British forces attacking Massawa agreed to an 18-hour truce at the request of the Italian forces, allowing them time to consider the British terms of surrender. Later, the Italian admiral stationed at the fort announced the decision to defend to the end, and the battle resumed at 1 p.m. yesterday. The two sides exchanged artillery fire. Soon, the British Air Force dispatched planes to bomb the Italian positions. The Italian forces did not make an effort to defend the mountain road from Asmara to Massawa, so there was little hope of holding Massawa. In the final British offensive, a unit of the Free French Foreign Legion acted as the vanguard. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Nairobi: When South African and West African troops entered Addis Ababa on the 6th of this month with the vanguard, they captured many enemies, including numerous Italian pilots. The fighting in the area is continuing. British forces on all lines are pursuing the enemy. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Confirmation of New Foreign Rice Orders Boosts Market;囤户 Compete to Sell; Only Regular粳 and Glutinous Rice Still Rising by Two or Three Dollars</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market opened yesterday morning with vendors and囤户 capitalizing on the momentum from the previous day, attempting to use their manipulation tactics, which attracted blind support from new outside囤户, resulting in a continued tight situation. Prices soared again, rising by two or three dollars compared to the previous morning's closing. For example, Saigon No. 1 opened at 111 yuan, No. 2 at 112 yuan, white-bodied small-grain at 111 yuan, and broken rice was seen to have continued large shipments arriving at the port. Moreover, new foreign rice orders were confirmed, causing浮户 to rush to sell first, and the market immediately fell by one or two yuan. The midday closing was already weaker than the previous evening, and the selling pressure was even stronger in the afternoon, with the market showing a particularly soft trend. As a result, all rice varieties were down by one yuan to one and a half yuan compared to the previous evening, while broken rice decreased by two yuan. The closing price for Saigon No. 2 was only 113-114 yuan, No. 2 was 110 yuan, Siam No. 1 was 112-113 yuan, fire-grained rice was 112 yuan, second-grade was 110 yuan, white-bodied small-grain was 110 yuan, Zhongguan was 109 yuan, second-grade was 107-108 yuan, Dong 砶 pointed rice was 102 yuan, special grade was 104 yuan, broken pointed rice was 90 yuan, Wuhu pointed rice was 110 yuan, and 109 yuan.回籠 small-grain opened at 131 yuan to 131.5 yuan in the early morning, and broken rice opened at 105 yuan to 105.5 yuan, up two or three yuan from the previous midday. However, by the afternoon, the price was reduced by two or three yuan, but there were still few takers. The total volume of現 rice traded was 20,000 bags, and the volume of回籠 original packages was approximately 700 tons. New transactions included 500 tons of Heda small-grain at a price of 131.3 yuan, 500 tons of Saigon No. 1 at a price of 134.8 yuan, and 500 tons of Saigon No. 1 at a price of 133 yuan. Dafu and others also had several transactions in negotiation. Therefore, since there are shipping slots this time, there are likely to be more deals concluded.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the source of supply continues uninterrupted. The French company's *Kim Dinh* arrived at the port yesterday morning, carrying over 13,500 bags of foreign rice directly from Saigon, berthing at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. Jardine Matheson's *Lishun* also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying over 10,101 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Another 3,700 bags are scheduled to be shipped to Qingdao on the same ship tomorrow. It is also reported that a large shipment of Burmese foreign rice arrived in Shanghai today, carried by the *Maler*, which loaded in Rangoon. The exact quantity will be investigated and reported later.</p>
<p>The arrival of thick and thin粳 and other domestic rice varieties remains scarce. However, in terms of sales, stores and customers saw that foreign rice was constantly rising, and domestic rice was relatively cheaper. They coincided, and suddenly competed to buy, creating an abnormal situation. It seemed that supply was insufficient. Merchants took advantage of the opportunity to raise prices aggressively, and market prices saw a significant increase of three or four yuan. The opening price for regular帮斛 was 124 yuan for清特粳, 122 yuan for特白粳, and 120 yuan.崑山斛 saw a high粳 of 118 yuan, market 白粳 of 115-116 yuan, and medium and low-grade goods also required 112-113 yuan. Qingjiao斛 saw thin rice at 112.5 yuan, 112 yuan, and the second-grade at 110.05 yuan. There were no reports of原包 sales.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice is currently selling well and prices are consistently rising. Hong Kong special grade opened at 110 yuan, 109 yuan, ordinary grade at 106-107 yuan, Zhongguan at 104 yuan, special glutinous rice at 101 yuan, 100 yuan, ordinary glutinous rice at 97-98 yuan, and glutinous broken rice at 93-94 yuan, a sharp increase of two or three yuan compared to the previous level.</p>
<h3>South Seas Sales Active; Flour Market Continues to Prosper</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's現 flour market saw active sales to South Seas customers, with continued demand from Hong Kong and other places. In addition, with the situation in the Pacific becoming increasingly severe, people were hoping for a good outcome despite the large volume of flour in stock. Market sentiment remained strong. Australian flour brands such as Clock Tower and Flower &amp; Bird rose again to 29.5 yuan. Roosevelt warehouse goods required an additional two角. Gold 牌坎 flour also jumped over the 29 yuan mark to 29.05 yuan. However, rumors of a pullback in rice prices caused profitable囤户 to release some inventory, leading to a weakening situation. The situation leveled off again in the evening. The flat selling price of Hua factory flour remained at 25 yuan, with the Fuxin factory still releasing over 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market was particularly firm. With scarce shipments from the interior and rising rice and flour prices, people were solely focused on pushing prices up. There were even calls for 50 yuan in the market. It was reported that the Japanese factory's retail purchase price was still 45-46 yuan, with only occasional sporadic purchases.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Still Subject to Manipulation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market initially continued the momentum from the previous day, rising by over one yuan in the morning. Later, rumors circulated that over 2,000 barrels of real chips were being prepared, causing market sentiment to loosen. Many浮多 took the opportunity to kick out inventory, and prices frequently declined. At the most sluggish time,遠期运油 fell by two yuan compared to the previous day's market. However, the market was soon strongly lifted by large囤户, and the market turned higher again. As a result, it still rose by about half a yuan. Factory oil had a narrower scope and a slower trend of ups and downs, so yesterday's market saw a good increase of three yuan due to the potential from the previous day. It is estimated that 150担 were traded, with prices ranging from 109 to 10 yuan. Dalian oil traded 200 barrels of現货, with prices ranging from 153 to 52 yuan. Delivery was scheduled for 350 barrels in April, with prices ranging from 152.5 yuan to 152 yuan. Delivery was scheduled for 1,500 barrels in late April, with prices ranging from 153 to 50 yuan. After several fluctuations, the closing price returned to 52 yuan. Peanut oil showed a normal trend, and the market had no major fluctuations. The opening price for Yantai canned oil was estimated at 100 cans at a price of 158 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Continues to Have Considerable Settlements</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed prices remain flat. The underground market for British and American exchange rates remained uninteresting. However, the market was still busy due to practical needs, such as Japanese spinning mills and oil trading companies coming to扒结. Therefore, the trend softened. Although Hong Kong Telegraph had thrown out塞, HSBC had a good appetite and kept the market to 0.15625 and 0.3125, which were 3 shillings 2034375 and 5 yuan 3125. Futures British also softened slightly at the close, while the US was flat.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Throws Out Shillings</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bars and the American silver price and London's 生 gold were still stable. Exchange rates, except for the US-Shanghai rate, which fell by 2 points, were still flat. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained as before. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning: British gold at 3 shillings 25, US exchange at 5 yuan 44375, with no gains or losses compared to yesterday. After opening, foreign banks traded American exchange at 5 yuan 34375 for the current month. The market was stable. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced flat. Afterwards, Japanese spinning mills and oil trading companies came to扒结, and foreign banks and speculators also came to absorb, causing the market to tighten slightly. It is estimated that美滙 opened at 5 yuan 3125 for April-May. Soon, although Hong Kong Telegraph had thrown out selling shillings, the bullish side still had buying intentions, so the market continued to tighten. Spot shillings were traded at 3 shillings 25. Afterwards, buying and selling was scarce, and the state was sluggish until the closing, with a lack of changes. As a result, the现期 British gold was 3 shillings 234275, and the US 美滙 was 5 yuan 3125, which was 0.015625 tight for spot British gold compared to the previous day and soft 0.03125 for 美滙. The futures British also shrank 0.015625, while the US was unchanged. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Cash Backs Futures, Sees Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's 暗盘范围 was still narrow, but the potential continued to be firm, and the result rose again by 32 yuan, because the foreign exchange market was reported to be tight, and掉期逼近, because calculating according to HSBC's柜檯 listing of 5 yuan 3125, the total value was 6,555 yuan 3 jiao, so this time掉期, the空方 must still post, causing Floating 空 to continue to hedge, and the number was more than the previous day, so the price was easy to rise. Zhongyi, Defu, Tianyuan, Dafeng, and Mingfeng absorbed the most strongly. The closing price was reported at 6,537 yuan. About 12,000 to 13,000 taels were traded for half a day. The listing (that is, opening) for the April掉期 will start at 1:00 PM today, and end at 2:00 PM, at 1:15. The cash market situation was relaxed because the customer帮吃胃 was loose, and then it fell. The volume was also small, only in the beginning 50 taels for Deda Jinyifeng, plus 180 yuan, since then the buyer杳然, in the end 170 yuan was added, someone sold, and the buyer only wanted to add 130 yuan, in the case of a fatigue drop of 10 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>开始Begin 掉期 Today</p>
<p>In the early morning, many strips (10 taels) were traded according to the挂牌, but because Cheng Ji forced a塞 of 250 taels, it was only reported that the opening was 6,500 yuan,反撳 5 yuan compared to the previous day, but soon鑫源·恒记·德孚·德成· and other狂捞, although Cheng Ji continued to sell several hundred taels, it冲 out to 6,510 yuan, and it stopped selling and became a purchase, so it立昂 to 6,529 yuan. Later, Xianghe·德大· many 多头吐出, and 恒记反进 became 塞, and soon it returned to 6,500 yuan. In the end, because the foreign exchange market was slightly tight, the buying wind rose again, and Mingfeng·益大·公和· and others strongly entered, rising to 6,540 yuan. However, at this time浮多 took profits and sold them. In addition, 恒记 frantically sold 2,000 taels, and it fell again to 6,525 yuan. After that, Tianyuan·大丰·德孚· and other狂进补空, the closing price was heavy high to 6,542 yuan. Then, Xinfeng Yong sold, so the result was reported to be 6,537 yuan,续回涨 32 yuan from the previous day.

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Mixed Brand Yarn Prices Have Risen Considerably; Double Horse Yarn Takes a Plunge</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the upward trend is very strong. This is because the market has been fluctuating for a long time, and mixed brand yarns have been rising step by step, to a considerable degree. Double Horse yarn has been building momentum for a long time, and recently there have been moves to ship it overseas, so speculators have been very active, taking a plunge. Buyers flocked in, and at the same time, cotton cloth sales were brisk and prices were very high. Compared to this, cotton yarn alone was cheap. Under these circumstances, the buying momentum for Double Horse yarn suddenly increased, and the market rebounded upwards. The highest price was 1,437 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,409 yuan. In the afternoon, the upward trend was even stronger. It initially traded at 1,438 yuan, and then news came that Double Horse yarn was being exported again, and the buying interest was even stronger, rising to 1,449 yuan, already exceeding the high price of 1,442 yuan on March 25th. Some profits were taken in the middle, and the price returned to 1,438 yuan, and the final price was 1,443 yuan, but it was said that it traded at 1,450 yuan in the evening.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the strong momentum from the afternoon of the previous day. The situation looked very strong. The opening price was 1,413 yuan, but profit-takers came out to sell. However, short sellers did not move, so the price fell slightly to 1,409 yuan. However, the situation for mixed brand yarn was quite expensive. Hong Kong buyers had a good appetite for Double Horse yarn, and the buying interest was very strong, rising to 1,427 yuan. At this time, the margin call rose again, and people's confidence was quite strong. Moreover, the buying momentum on the surface was exceptionally good, rising directly to 1,437 yuan, then returning to 1,432 yuan. The closing price was still 1,436 yuan. Statistics show that 9,235 bales were traded in half a day. The amount bought by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 835, Colleagues 8,400</p>
<p>Total 9,235</p>
<h3>Fine Cotton More Scarce</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still firm and tight because the yarn market is good, and the prices of 42-count and 32-count fine yarn threads have risen sharply. Therefore, raw materials are even more scarce. As for the American and Indian cotton markets, they have recently turned weak, but the situation for spot goods in Shanghai has not been greatly affected, which is due to the lack of inventory.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market fell due to the liquidation of various parties and the weakness of Wall Street stocks. Yesterday's closing price was 5 to 12 points lower than the previous day. The Indian cotton market was quite flat, rising first due to purchases by colleagues, and then falling back due to some liquidation. The closing price rose slightly by about one rupee. It is also predicted that the market situation at the opening today will be 1.5 rupees lower.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is even more popular. People from all parties have been very excited in recent days, and the yarn market is gradually advancing, so the market situation continues to be active. Both high-number cotton and factories have purchased in large quantities.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Shows Very Little Improvement; Closed for Four Days Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The grey market for public bonds showed no sign of improvement yesterday. Although there were large purchases, there were also large sales at any time. This is still due to the expiration of bank withdrawals, and spot goods are flowing out. Each bank has them. Before they are all sold, it is absolutely not easy for the market price to recover. In addition, there will be a spring break starting tomorrow, with a total of four days without a market, including Sunday. Therefore, most people are unwilling to go long during the holiday to avoid interest losses. The lottery for Class C bonds was held today. Yesterday afternoon, asset calculation had already been done, so the market prices in the morning and afternoon were completely different. The other varieties were still showing signs of weakness. Today is only half a day of trading, and I am afraid there may not be any changes. Yesterday morning, Hengfu bought 400,000 Class C bonds on behalf of Shunchang, and Yitai bought 300,000 Class E bonds, while Yuxing sold 400,000 Class E bonds. Xie Xingyuan and Hongda sold more than 300,000 Class C bonds. The supply and demand situation still offset each other. Because there were more sales by retail investors, the market price was still weak. In the afternoon, Class C bonds opened at 5.8 yuan after deducting the lottery winnings, and the lottery winnings right was 0.8 yuan. After that, it stabilized without rising or falling. There were no large purchases, and the sellers had also reduced their holdings. Although Lianyi, Xinfu, Lianhe, Lemao, and the above four firms still had purchases, Shengda, Xieda, and Hu Heji also had supplies, and Yitai also had resale. The market was slightly tighter than in the morning. As a result, except for Class C bonds, which did not count due to the deduction of lottery winnings, the rest showed mixed highs and lows, with the number being only 5 cents to 2 cents. The total number of transactions was about 1.8 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 300 shares of Chinese-owned Electric Company were traded at a price of 8 yuan each.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Tuesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and British-owned Far East companies' stocks are still flat. Bank stocks saw mixed ups and downs. Jardine Matheson Bank shares fell 1 shilling 3 pence to a price of 8 pounds 16 shillings 3 pence. HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rose half a pound to a price of 75 pounds. Also, yesterday's telegram for Hong Kong-registered shares was 71.5 pounds, which was a mistake for 78.5 pounds, an increase of half a pound from the previous day. Today, it still stands at the original level. There is a market with no transactions. There are no other changes.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Prices are Rising Sharply; Guangdong and Hong Kong Still Have Purchases; Speculators are Eager to Absorb</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market rose sharply because buyers from Guangdong and Hong Kong still made large purchases, and speculators were particularly eager to absorb. Sales prices rose sharply. White goods and coarse cloth rose 5 jiao to 1 yuan, fine cloth, twill and colored cloth rose about 1 yuan, bleached cloth rose 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao. Deep-colored fine yarn fabrics such as serge and straight tribute goods rose 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan per piece. Transactions on the street were very prosperous, totaling nearly a thousand pieces. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers purchased more than 500 pieces of line, serge, etc., and Zhejiang and Fujian buyers purchased more than 300 pieces of blue cloth, yuan twill, coarse cloth, etc.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Yesterday, due to continued strong actual sales, internal and external speculators added more volume, and the upward trend was very strong. The highest selling price of white goods dragon head fine cloth in the future market opened at 52.25 yuan. Later, due to retail investors taking profits and reselling, it fell back to 51.6 yuan, while fine twill was very firm and expensive, rising by more than 1 yuan per piece. Colored goods Four Gentlemen serge closed at 1 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Speculators Absorb Sugar; Prices of Coarse and Refined White Sugar Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was tight because speculators resumed absorption, and prices continued to be tight. The association set the price at 88.5 to 88.7 yuan for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar, an increase of about 1 yuan. The initial price for April 20th delivery was 89 yuan, then it eased back to 88.6 yuan, and the closing price rose again to 89.4 yuan, an increase of 1.3 yuan before and after. Taikoo Refined White B Mark was 89 yuan, also up 1 yuan. The rest did not trade, and the market was firm and tight.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hainan Dried Longan Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Since the price of Hainan dried longan began to rise, the firms have been preparing some, and the goods in the hands of the shops have been scarce, and they are unwilling to let them go easily, resulting in a sudden situation where demand exceeds supply. Yesterday, I heard that dozens of pieces were opened again, and the price was raised by about 10 yuan compared to the previous one. Although the shops called for further increases, the upward trend was too fast, and they are temporarily watching the stability.</p>
<h3>Lily Buds: No New Arrivals; Selling Prices Increase by 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Because there are no new arrivals of lily buds, the market inventory is decreasing day by day, so the trend is gradually rising, and items from Zhuang are even more rare, so the market price is calling for 180 yuan. Yesterday, items from the village were slightly opened, and the price was 160 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Although the market price has reached a peak, there is still a lack of loosening.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: US Raw Silk Inventory Declines Again</h3>
<p>Prices May Rise Gradually</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from New York, the United States imported 21,626 bales of raw silk in March, an increase of 2,842 bales from the previous month. Total consumption was 25,828 bales, and the inventory was 49,904 bales, all of which decreased compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Looking at the above report, we can see that the price of raw silk may rise gradually in the future. Taking the import of raw silk into the United States as an example, since the outbreak of the European War, the import of European silk to the United States has been completely cut off. Even the silk transportation of other countries has been affected by the war. Although the total import volume in March increased slightly compared to the previous one, its consumption has exceeded the import volume, that is, consumption and import have lost their balance. Therefore, if there are no large imports to make up for the large consumption, the inventory will decrease day by day. Looking at the March inventory, it has decreased by 4,402 bales compared to the previous month. From this, we can infer that the current need for raw silk in the United States is very urgent, and the phenomenon that demand exceeds supply in the market will affect the future of silk prices and make them rise.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Fennel Prices Increase by 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the relationship between production prices and exchange rates, the cost of fennel in the Shanghai market is increasing day by day, so the trend is very tight. Yesterday, the market was calling for 350 yuan, and the previous price was 300 yuan. Although no transactions were made, the tight situation in the future market can be clearly seen.</p>

<h3>The Time Limit for Storing Goods in Customs Warehouses Should be Considered</h3>
<p>The General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs issued Notice No. 121 yesterday, stating: "According to the regulations on ordinary customs warehouses, the time limit for storing imported goods in customs warehouses was previously extended to March 31st of this year due to the unrest of the situation, as recorded in Notice No. 119 of this Department on December 16th of last year. Now, in order to adapt to the current commercial situation, all goods stored in customs warehouses, in accordance with Article 14 of the said regulations, which originally had a time limit of twelve months, are allowed to be extended to June 30th of this year. All goods currently stored in customs warehouses that are scheduled to expire before June 30th of this year are still allowed to be stored until that day. Let all merchants know." It is said that for any goods that have been imported, the Jianghai Customs should be responsible for urging all holders of goods to leave the warehouse on time and supply the market. Otherwise, it may easily be manipulated by merchants, which will not only be detrimental to commerce, but also cause harm to society. It is hoped that the Jianghai Customs will give it serious attention.</p>
<h3>Two Soldiers Killed by Gunfire on Yangshupu Road, Hongkou; Two Soldiers Died on the Spot, and the Murderer Escaped; A Large-Scale Search After the Incident Yielded Nothing</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post stated: "This morning (9th), two more Japanese military police officers were assassinated in the Yangshupu District of eastern Shanghai. The murderers were two Chinese. At 11:30 am today, at the intersection of Dalian Bay Road and Yangshupu Road, they used pistols to fire several shots at two corporals, Yoshida and Kojima, of the Japanese military police team in the area. Then they fled along Yulin Road. Yoshida was hit by two bullets in the head, and Kojima was hit by two bullets in the chest. Both fell to the ground and died instantly.</p>
<p>Japanese Hit the Murderer</p>
<p>A foreign witness witnessed the incident and reported the situation to the police and the Japanese authorities. According to the foreign witness, the murderers ran away immediately after firing the shots. The two Japanese soldiers, who were hit by bullets and fell to the ground, died on the spot. The Japanese military authorities in this city officially disclosed that the two Japanese soldiers were stationed in front of a copper-stacking warehouse near Dalian Bay Road and McKinley Road this morning. They then went to the Japanese military police camp on Yangshupu Road and were assassinated on the way. The incident happened unexpectedly, and they were hit by bullets and fell to the ground before they could fight back. They died within minutes.</p>
<p>After the incident, the Japanese authorities and public concession police officers immediately arrived at the scene to conduct an investigation, but no one was arrested. A foreign witness who saw the two murderers fleeing along Yulin Road has explained the appearance of the murderers to the Japanese authorities and the police. It is said that at the end of last year, there were 17 cases of Japanese soldiers being sniped in this city, and about 14 people died. Today's murder case is the first in more than two months. Because the incident was serious, the Japanese side immediately closed all the bridges on the Suzhou River, cutting off north-south traffic and conducting a strict search. Residents and pedestrians in the Hongkou District were searched for about an hour. Until about 3:30 pm yesterday, the closed bridges were removed and traffic was restored.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball Factory Stops Supplying Spot Goods; Causing a Fuel Panic; Speculators of Warehouse Receipts are Secretly Manipulating; Raising the List Price Mutually with the Coal Ball Factory</h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, the price of coal balls has soared by 100%, which has a great impact on the citizens. According to the Shanghai Coal and Firewood Association, the reason for the soaring price of coal balls again is that the coal ball factory has stopped spot sales and only supplies warehouse receipts. Most of the coal balls from each factory are supplied to fuel retailers for daily sales. The factory has stopped spot sales, and retailers have no goods to sell in the market. They must buy warehouse receipts from the market. The speculators of warehouse receipts raise the price, and the factory price also increases accordingly, creating a panic. The association submitted a letter to the authorities yesterday, requesting a quick correction. The original letter to the Political Department of the Municipal Council and Mr. He Dekui is recorded below:</p>
<p>Coal Shops Issue Goods; Refuse to Issue</p>
<p>"Respectfully, the Da China Coal Shop and other members jointly stated in a letter that the coal ball factory's products are only supplied for warehouse receipt collection, and the supply of spot goods to our retailers who need coal balls has been stopped. If they want to purchase coal balls, they must purchase warehouse receipts on the black market. By the time they purchase the warehouse receipts and go to the factory to deliver the goods, the factory deliberately delays the delivery of the goods, or only delivers one-fourth of each ton, and the overdue warehouse rent is fully charged. As a result, those who have no goods to supply in the market have closed down, and the suffering is unspeakable. Also, the factories usually operate retail sales concurrently, exceeding the scope and hindering the livelihood of retail colleagues. The above points are closely related to the livelihood of colleagues and should be dealt with immediately to ensure business, etc., according to this, it is found that the coal ball factories have recently published notices limiting the time for clearing coal ball warehouse receipts and stopping the supply of spot sales to each retail store. Speculators of warehouse receipts are secretly manipulating and raising high prices, and then the factory price also increases accordingly, creating a panic. According to the situation of fuel panic in the spring of last year, it is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Speculators Raise the Price of Warehouse Receipts Again</p>
<p>I believe that if the coal ball factory wants to cope with the fuel panic, it should continue to supply retail stores with daily sales/spot sales. With the circulation of spot goods, the people's hearts in the society will be stable and there will be no panic, and they will fall into the hands of speculators/warehouse receipts. Except for selling at a flat price, there is no way to implement their high-price manipulation skills. Also, for those who hold warehouse receipts, deliberately delaying the delivery of goods when they request delivery is to create the fact that overdue warehouse rent is charged, which is even more inappropriate. As for the coal ball factories, they are originally product wholesale, and there is no need to directly sell to users if distribution points are established. The factory should immediately stop retail sales to cut off the business of retail colleagues. According to the previous situation in the letter, we are corresponding and respectfully requesting your bureau to be concerned about the security of society. For the above situation, we earnestly request a quick correction to stabilize society and maintain commerce, which is a public interest." The association also sent a letter to the Coal Ball Industry Association and requested assistance.</p>
<p>Evaluation Committee First Gives Admonishment</p>
<p>Since the large-scale lumps of coal slag were illegally monopolized by several large coal companies, the market price of coal per catty has been rising frequently. Not only is it related to the livelihood of ordinary people and social security, but it also hinders the development of the entire industry. Moreover, the high rise in the price of coal per catty this time is not due to the unsmooth source of supply or the thin inventory. The main factor is that the large-scale inventory is being controlled by people, so public opinion is in an uproar, and all residents of the city are unanimously hoping that the authorities will punish the illegal coal merchants by the deadline. The evaluation committees of the two concessions, considering that the price of coal is rising so much, is due to the coal merchants' mischief, and that the impact of the frequent rise in the price of coal per catty on society is no less than that of rice and grain, they cannot sit idly by because of their responsibilities. Yesterday, they sent personnel to visit the responsible persons of the Coal Industry Association and the Coal Ball Association to inquire about the reasons for the sharp rise in the price of coal per catty. At the same time, they informed them of the authorities' intentions, instructed them to find ways to suppress the price of coal and be responsible for advising major coal companies to gradually release the hoarded goods. If there are any difficulties, they can inform the authorities and give them great assistance. It is understood that the personnel also informed them of the interests related to the livelihood of ordinary people in the sharp rise in the market price of coal per catty, so the authorities are paying close attention to it. Also, yesterday's coal market was still quite chaotic, and each holder dared to refuse to sell to the market again, waiting for the coal price to continue to rise before releasing it, in order to strip away illegal profits. If they are so poisonous, it is really heartbreaking. It is hoped that the authorities will impose strict regulations to achieve the effect of punishing one as a warning to hundreds.</p>
<h3>Employees Detained by the Central Bank Have All Returned Home; But They Are Still Under Close Observation</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post stated: "I have recently learned that more than 130 employees of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, who were suddenly detained last month, were completely released late yesterday (8th) after 18 days. Today (9th), they were able to reunite with their families. It is said that after they were detained last month, they have all taken long-term sick leave. Although they have been released, they have not yet gone to the bank to work today, but they are still living in the dormitory on Jessfield Road. It is believed that they are still under close observation. It is said that five senior employees of the Bank of China were the first to regain their freedom on Sunday.</p>
<h3>The American Association Will Meet Today; To Discuss the Sale of the Clubhouse</h3>
<p>Members of the American Association of Shanghai will hold a meeting at 5:30 pm today to discuss the issue of selling the association's clubhouse to the Shanghai Securities Company for a price of 2,255,000 yuan. There are members who support and oppose the sale of the association's clubhouse. It is expected that there will be a fierce debate between the two sides at that time.</p>
<p>Green Grass Covers the Pond</p>

There are flowers growing on the small hills, tender buds showing through the branches, and the pond water is glistening, with green grass growing everywhere. People who are busy in the city take time to go there to enjoy themselves, and they can appreciate some of the pleasures of nature! (Photo by Wang Errong)</p>
<h3>Aigao is Still Detained on a French Gunboat; Has Met with Lawyers; The Free French Movement is Still Very Angry; The French Navy is Preparing for Preliminary Trial Steps</h3>
<p>A French businessman in Shanghai, Aigao, was recently accused by the French Navy of participating in the escape of several French sailors, which led to his detention on a French gunboat. Some French expatriates in Shanghai are still indignant about this. Aigao's lawyer, Pleyme, applied to the French Navy two days ago for permission to visit his client, explaining that he could not prepare for him without meeting his client. It was recently heard that Pulot was granted special permission by the French Navy on the afternoon of the 8th to board the ship to meet Aigao and talk secretly for more than half an hour. It is also heard that Pushi will be granted permission to visit Aigao again.</p>
<p>French Mood Becomes More Intense</p>
<p>At the same time, Aigao's friends and the French expatriates in this city who support the Free French Movement are broadcasting more and more intensely on the radio. It is said that the Vichy government's representative in Shanghai illegally arrested Aigao, which has actually issued a challenge. The Free French here will accept this challenge without hesitation.</p>
<p>Aigao is Disabled; Not Suitable for Sailing</p>
<p>Regarding the rumor that Aigao will be escorted to Saigon for trial, a person familiar with Aigao said that sailing would kill Aigao because Aigao is a disabled person with only one leg left. The doctor has instructed him not to travel by boat under any circumstances. Shi once served with Aigao in the special patrol team of the French police department for several years. It is said that the special patrol team, although quite indignant at the French authorities' arrest, does not intend to strike. If there is an emergency, they will definitely be dispatched. Most of the people the reporter met yesterday laughed at Aigao being accused of inducing French soldiers to escape and criticized the authorities' attitude in implementing the arrest, and denounced the procedure as completely illegal.</p>
<p>Preparing for Preliminary Interrogation on the Ship</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post stated: "Aigao, the leader of the local Tegor movement, is still being detained on the French gunboat Chana today (9th) after being arrested by the French Navy on Saturday and Sunday. It is believed that the ship is currently preparing for Aigao's preliminary trial. According to the law, after listening to the evidence during the preliminary trial, if necessary, the French authorities will escort Aigao to Saigon (Far East French Navy Headquarters) for trial by the naval court.</p>
<h3>Garment Industry Resumes Work Today; Auto Workers' Strike Spreads</h3>
<p>The garment workers' strike dispute, nearing its end, with labor-management conflict quite intense, has resulted in the following resolution for resuming work, decided by labor representatives: Labor should collectively resume work by 9:00 AM on the 10th of this month; Before any mediation, the labor union should be responsible for guaranteeing no similar conflicts occur; Each shop should immediately provide living (clothing) food according to (glutamic acid), without refusing any worker to return to work; The trade association will be responsible for requesting the police to bail out arrested workers, and both parties are scheduled to sign labor-management terms on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>Staff of the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>Due to the continuous soaring prices and the financial difficulties faced by the staff, the Commercial Press Staff Association convened a standing committee meeting on the 19th of last month, resolving to request another salary increase. They sent a letter to General Manager Wang in Hong Kong, requesting a reasonable remedy for the staff's living conditions. Another letter was sent on March 24th, but no reply has been received to date. On the 5th of this month, the Staff Association dispatched Shi Jiu-yun, a shareholder of the personnel department, to Hong Kong for negotiations. Urgent telegrams were also sent to Hong Kong twice in the past two days to urge action. A notice to the staff was also issued, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that the minimum living expense for a worker in March was 125 yuan per month, but very few staff members of the Commercial Press earned this amount. It also expressed hope that the company could implement a "minimum wage rate" method in accordance with the clearly stipulated provisions of the labor laws from April onwards. It is said that both labor and management will sincerely discuss this matter.</p>
<h3>Customs Prohibits Export of Metal Machinery and Other Goods; Company Application Rejected, Allegedly Due to Japanese Pressure</h3>
<p>It is rumored that for the past few days, attempts to ship machinery and other goods to various ports in the south, even with the necessary customs permits, have been proven unsuccessful. It is said that a major transportation company in this city attempted to ship machinery to Rangoon but was denied permission by the customs. According to an employee of the company, they applied to the customs and received a notice yesterday stating that they could not immediately ship machinery to southern ports. However, after a considerable period, the customs would notify the applicant regarding the situation.</p>
<p>Prohibited for British Territories</p>
<p>The customs' actions, whether tacitly refusing to issue necessary permits or delaying them for various reasons, have not been explained. It is also reported that merchants attempting to export handicrafts, electrical appliances, and accessories have encountered similar difficulties when applying to the customs. However, the customs has not issued any formal notice declaring a ban on the entry and exit of the aforementioned goods. According to transportation company sources, metal machinery, handicrafts, etc., are all prohibited from being shipped to southern ports such as Singapore, Rangoon, Haiphong, Saigon, and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>This Measure Recently Implemented</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," several major exporters in this city have been unable to obtain the necessary customs permits to ship handicrafts and parts to various ports in China, Rangoon, and Vietnam. According to major Chinese transportation companies, the main reason for the customs' prohibition of these goods is said to be Japanese pressure. It is reported that the ban was only implemented three days ago, as a major British company still shipped a set of electric motors and engines to South China on the 4th of this month. As for the reasons for the ban, no official explanation has been obtained from relevant parties. It is reported that it is still impossible to ship machinery to North China. The rumor that the sale of cotton and wool fabrics is also prohibited is incorrect. According to a major Chinese merchant, there have been no difficulties in obtaining customs permits for shipping textiles to South China.</p>

<h3>Cancellation of Increased Litigation Fees</h3>
<p>The Rules for Litigation Fees, established on September 20th of the Republic of China year nine, were revised and promulgated on June 29th of year eleven. Subsequently, due to changes in social circumstances, the Judicial and Administrative Department re-established them on August 1st of year twenty-seven, appropriately increasing litigation fees, and the title was changed to the Provisional Rules for Litigation Fees. Furthermore, the former Jiangsu High Court Third Branch reported to the department for approval to increase the fees by 50% on August 5th of year twenty-seven. The Shanghai Bar Association, believing that the increased litigation fees would cause unbearable suffering for litigants, repeatedly petitioned the Judicial Yuan and the Judicial and Administrative Department to reduce the fees. It is now reported that the association received a reply from the Judicial Yuan on March 27th of this year, Order No. 14, stating: "A submission has been made requesting the prior revocation of the original case of increasing Shanghai's trial fees by 50%, and to discuss new regulations and appropriately reduce fees. The submission has been noted. The Rules for Litigation Fees have been re-established and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan after further review by this Yuan's legal and administrative departments and are currently under review. The request to first revoke the original case of increasing trial fees by 50% should be approved. In addition to instructing the Judicial and Administrative Department to comply accordingly, you are hereby notified."</p>

Each person is limited to purchasing one rice token, which is one catty of plain rice, costing 30 cents. At the beginning of operations, only a little over a thousand people purchased rice, but this has now increased to over four thousand people per day. It is reported that the society has sold approximately 160,000 rice tokens by the end of January, incurring a loss of nearly 60,000 yuan. It is becoming difficult to manage. Facing the continued rise in rice prices and the increasingly difficult livelihoods of the poor, it is difficult to suddenly stop. It is hoped that benevolent gentlemen will generously donate.</p>

<h3>Garland Building Sold - Price Four Million; Buyer from Guangdong; Negotiations Also Underway for Benevolent Tower</h3>
<p>The Garland Building (Liza Building) at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, a property of real estate tycoon Silas Aaron Hardoon, has reportedly been sold to a Cantonese for four million yuan. This is the largest real estate transaction in Shanghai since the sale of the Broadway Mansions two years ago. It is widely believed that the buyer has also built and contracted to purchase the Benevolent Tower at 353 Nanjing Road (also a Hardoon property). It is rumored in real estate circles that the total price of these two buildings is 9.7 million yuan. It is reported that negotiations for the sale of the Garland Building began several months ago, and a deal was recently reached and payment has already been made. Well-informed sources in real estate circles claim that with the current low currency value and high land prices, the selling price is quite fair. The Garland Building is named after Silas Aaron Hardoon's wife, Liza Hardoon. The Chase Bank is located on the lower floors of the building.</p>
<h3>Husband Suffering from Lung Disease; Wife Commits Suicide by Poison; Husband Not Dead, Wife Passes First; Young Children Orphaned, Pitiable</h3>
<p>Xu Ying-ping from Chuansha, aged 29 this year, was diagnosed with second-stage lung disease. He came to Shanghai for treatment in the previous year and showed slight improvement. The doctor instructed him to stay in the hospital for three months for recuperation to ensure his recovery. However, Xu, constrained by financial difficulties, was only hospitalized for one month before returning home. Recently, his illness relapsed, and the situation was dire. He was accompanied by his wife, Xu Pan-shi, to Shanghai and admitted to the Shanghai Women and Children's Hospital at 98 Route Massenet. Due to a family relationship with the hospital director, Pan-shi also stayed in the hospital to care for him. Unexpectedly, after a doctor's diagnosis, it was determined that Xu's lung disease had reached the third stage and was beyond recovery. He could only prolong his life. Xu's wife, Pan-shi (aged 32 this year), was present and, in a moment of panic, thinking that her husband's death would leave three children with no means of support in the future, had a momentary lapse of reason. At 4:00 PM on the 8th, she secretly consumed poison within the hospital premises. The nurse discovered this and immediately attempted to save her. However, it was too late, and she died at 6:00 PM. The hospital reported this to the police station, and detectives were dispatched to investigate. The body was taken to the morgue. After the autopsy yesterday, because Pan-shi's husband, Xu Ying-ping, was in a terminal condition, the deceased's mother, Pan Cao-shi, arrived to claim the body for burial.</p>

<h3>Vessels Detained in Zhejiang Temporarily Not Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese blockade of various ports, not only have foreign vessels been detained in the Zhoushan waters, but ships returning to Shanghai from Zhejiang have also been prevented from berthing and unloading cargo. The incidents on Saturday and Sunday last week in which a German vessel of Jardine Matheson and an Italian vessel coming from the Jiangkou port to Shanghai were prevented from unloading cargo remain unresolved as of yesterday. Unexpectedly, the Italian vessel "Realta" from Zhejiang to Shanghai was also prevented from unloading cargo by the Japanese. Furthermore, the British vessel "Da Sheng," originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Dongshi the day before yesterday, was also prevented by the Japanese from loading cargo at the pier, resulting in an unsuccessful export. The detained vessels have each made representations to the Japanese, but the Japanese have not indicated that they can be released. It is reported that until this matter is resolved, the remaining vessels berthed at various ports in Zhejiang Province will temporarily not return to Shanghai to avoid similar obstacles and unnecessary losses.</p>
<h3>High Court Second Branch and Special District Court First Branch Invoke Anti-Drug Regulations; Regulations Strictly Prohibit Cultivation, Trafficking, and Consumption; Penalties Prescribed Can Almost Encompass all Articles of the Law; Both Courts Implemented Yesterday</h3>
<p>Opium and heroin, among other drugs, are extremely harmful to the people's health. The National Government has issued repeated orders to strictly prohibit their consumption and has established anti-smoking and anti-drug regulations, punishing offenders with severe penalties. Considering the original regulations too lenient, the National Government has specifically revised them, renaming them the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Crimes, which were promulgated and implemented on February 19th of this year. The High Court Second Branch and the Special District Court First Branch in this city have been ordered to implement this law from yesterday. However, because the Shanghai Municipal Council's Legal Department has not yet completed the translation of the new regulations, it will continue to prosecute according to the old law. Nevertheless, the court will not continue to use the old law for this reason. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court First Branch's Criminal Division Two had a drug case in which the presiding judge, Zhong Qing, specifically informed the defendants that they would be sentenced according to the new law. As a result, the case was adjourned for sentencing. The penalties under this new law are several times heavier than those under the old law. Once violated, one can be sentenced to death in every instance. Here are the penalties for each article of the new law for general awareness and caution, to quit as soon as possible to avoid death. As defined in the law:</p>
<p>Drugs include opium, poppy, and poppy seeds, morphine, cocaine, heroin, and other compounds, and various colored pills composed and combined.</p>
<p>As for the penalties, Article 2: Those who plant poppies or manufacture opium or drugs shall be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Article 3: Those who gather as a family to resist the eradication of poppy seedlings shall be punished as follows: (1) The ringleader or those directing on the scene shall be sentenced to death; (2) Those jointly implementing shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than seven years; (3) Those assisting on the scene shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years and not more than seven years.</p>
<p>Article 4: Those who transport or sell drugs shall be sentenced to death. Those who possess drugs with the intent to sell shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Those who transport or sell opium shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. Those who possess opium with the intent to sell shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than ten years. Those who transport or sell poppy seeds shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years and not more than twelve years. Those who possess poppy seeds with the intent to sell shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years and not more than seven years. Those who import poppy seeds from foreign countries shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment; the same applies to those who export them to foreign countries.</p>
<p>Article 5: Those who intend to profit by administering morphine to others or providing a place for others to consume drugs shall be sentenced to death. Those who provide a place for others to consume opium shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Article 6: Those who administer morphine or consume drugs shall be sentenced to death. Those who consume opium shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than five years and may be fined no more than one thousand yuan. Addicts shall also be given a deadline to be medically treated and ordered to quit. Those who relapse after being medically treated and quitting shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.</p>
<p>Article 7: Those who assist others in committing the crimes in Articles 2 to 5 of this law shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than seven years. Those who assist others in committing the crime in Article 6 shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than seven years.</p>
<p>Article 8: Those who manufacture, transport, sell, or possess with the intent to sell equipment specifically used for manufacturing drugs, administering morphine, or consuming drugs shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years and not more than ten years and may also be fined no more than three thousand yuan. Those who manufacture, transport, sell, or possess with the intent to sell equipment specifically used for manufacturing or consuming opium shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than five years or fined one thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Article 9: Those who possess opium or drugs without other evidence of crime shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than five years and may also be fined no more than one thousand yuan. Those who possess equipment specifically used for manufacturing opium or drugs or consuming opium or drugs or administering morphine without other evidence of crime shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than three years or fined no more than five hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Article 10: Those who plant evidence or fabricate evidence to falsely accuse others of committing crimes under this law shall be punished according to the penalties in each respective article (omitted).</p>
<p>Article 11: Government officials who commit crimes shall be sentenced to death. Those who commit crimes under Article 6, paragraph 2, or Articles 7 to 10 shall be punished according to the highest penalty in each respective article.</p>
<p>Article 12: Government officials and military police who abuse their power to force others to commit crimes under Article 2 of this law shall be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Article 13: Government officials and military police who shield or solicit or accept bribes and condone others committing crimes under Articles 2 to 8 of this law shall be sentenced to death. The same applies to government officials and military police who allow criminals under this law to escape or steal or conceal seized opium or drugs (omitted).</p>

<p>Article 19: The death penalty shall be carried out by shooting (omitted).</p>
<p>Article 23: The duration of implementation of this law is set at three years.</p>
<p>In summary, almost all articles of the above regulations can result in the death penalty. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will quit and stay away, both to protect their health and to avoid violating the law and being punished.</p>

In the first match, the men's doubles team of Hong Dequan and Hou Shuji battled fiercely against Li Shengshi and Yang Jingling. The former were representatives of the Chinese team and had extraordinary strength, while the latter also performed extremely well yesterday. Therefore, the two teams fought tensely. In the first game, they repeatedly tied, but after twelve to twelve, Hong and Hou finally relied on three consecutive points to win the first game with fifteen to twelve. In the second game, both sides showed their skills and fought to a fourteen to fourteen tie. At this critical moment, Li and Yang suddenly attacked and won a game with seventeen to fourteen. In the final game, Hong and Hou played smoothly, while Li and Yang gradually became unable to support themselves, losing with six to fifteen. In conclusion, Hong and Hou defeated Li and Yang two to one, retaining this year's men's doubles championship. The second match was the women's singles final, with Mrs. Coates defeating Miss Pan Lira two to zero, winning the championship. In the final mixed doubles match, Miss Wei Wenyan and Hong Dequan played against Mrs. Burton and Mr. Gui. Wei and Hong won the first game with fifteen to six. Burton and Gui launched a fierce counterattack in the second game, frequently pressing, but Wei and Hong resisted, tying at thirteen to thirteen. At this time, Wei and Hong only needed to make a final push to win the championship, but instead, Burton and Gui won a game with fifteen to thirteen. In the final game, Hong Dequan, having fought continuously in the men's doubles and mixed doubles, gradually showed fatigue, and Miss Wei was relatively weak, finishing as runner-up. After the match, Mrs. McGregor, Chairman of the Xieqiao General Association, presented the awards on the spot, and the event concluded successfully.

<p>As mentioned at the beginning, the current youth have heavy homework, so teachers must provide guidance for their learning. The guidance items are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Establishing an excellent self-study environment: The light, temperature, and equipment of the student's self-study room must be extremely suitable. Even important tools for students, such as dictionaries, reference books, catalogs, indexes, and various wall charts and specimens, should be arranged as much as possible to make the environment academic.</p>
<p>(2) Teachers must teach students how to read: Reading is divided into reading aloud and silent reading, and into intensive reading and skimming. Each has its own appropriate method. It is not necessary to elaborate here. What students urgently want to know is how to read textbooks. When reading, when you see an important part, you can draw a line under the sentence or phrase, or make a note on the side of the book, or use the side of the book page to write a comment, write a summary, write a bibliography, write a question. It is best to write a question sentence for every important part you encounter while reading, just like a test question. After reading a process, use the written questions to test yourself to see if you understand. It is easy to know. How to find reference materials, such as dictionaries and encyclopedias, and how to use them. How to take notes. The details of the note format and other things that should be paid attention to, the teachers must explain to the students in detail first.</p>
<p>(3) Students must fully understand the assigned homework: Students have an excellent self-study environment and know how to read, so teachers can assign homework for them to preview. However, the assigned homework must be clearly understood by the students and arouse their interest. The method of assigning homework is to write a certain book from a certain page to a certain page, which is based on the page chapter. In addition, it is based on chapters or questions. The points to pay attention to when assigning are: A. Make students fully understand where to start and end. Teachers should give a brief introduction to the homework to arouse their interest in learning. B. The amount of homework should be suitable for each person's ability. C. When assigning, pay attention to accidental events, and it is not necessary to follow the order in the textbook. D. The time to assign homework is better during class time, as students are more attentive. If it is at the end of class, everyone is tired, and it takes one or two minutes to copy, and sometimes they find it annoying.</p>
<p>(4) Students' preview results must be examined: Some students preview their homework very diligently, while others are very lazy. The quality of their preview results must be examined. The method of examination can be based on students' preview notes, or based on oral tests, or by holding lectures and small debates, always aiming to prove that the minimum limit of preview has been reached.</p>
<p>The above points are very helpful for students to preview their daily homework. The author hopes that teachers can take on this responsibility of guidance (End).</p>

<h3>Egg and Stone</h3>
<p>— Xiaogu</p>
<p>The passion of young people is sometimes astonishing. Their hatred of evil is sometimes so strong that they use their fragile, egg-like strength to confront evil forces as hard as stone. The tragic outcome of hitting a stone with an egg is predictable. Their passion is admirable, but their inexperienced actions are sometimes foolish.</p>
<p>We should make modern youth smarter.</p>
<p>Evil forces must be opposed, but we cannot help but look around at the environment and rashly try. Young people should have the wisdom to look ahead and consider their steps, the perseverance to cultivate strength, and the vision to see opportunities. Continuous training can turn a fragile egg into a devastating iron bomb: the ravages of wind and rain can disintegrate and crack hard stones. Rather than hitting a stone with an egg, it is better to hit a stone with a bullet.</p>
<p>Looking ahead and behind is not hesitating, cultivating strength is not avoiding the important and taking the easy, and seeing opportunities is not escaping reality.</p>
<p>What young people should avoid is unnecessary sacrifice, and what they should make good use of is their passion.</p>
<p>Rather than hitting a stone with an egg, it is better to hit a stone with a bullet!</p>

<h3>He Would Rather Starve to Death at Home</h3>
<p>— Daiming</p>
<p>I don't know which afternoon it was, but my younger brother came home again with a tearful face. I felt very strange. However, my mother had already begun to ask questions:</p>
<p>"Why did you suddenly come home again?"</p>
<p>"I would rather starve to death at home; I don't want to do it anymore." My younger brother said directly: "Mom! You need to know that it's really suffering over there. There are no good three meals a day. You have to get up and work before dawn; you can't rest until the store closes at night. But the old man is still scolding you. What about a hundred or so dollars a load of rice...? Only knows how to eat, doesn't know how to work... The store is going to be eaten poor... Sometimes there are a few nasty words mixed in. During the day, you do a lot of work: pour out the spittoons, carry the children, cook, take care of the guests... If you are not careful, the boss's whip will mercilessly strike you. Mom! If you don't believe me, look at my body. This is a new wound from yesterday. It was because when I was cooking, the five-year-old little boss went to play with the neighbor's children. Somehow, the two got into a fight. After suffering a loss, he went home and told the boss's wife. The boss's wife picked up firewood and beat me hard. She said that I deliberately let the little boss go out and get beaten to death. Mom, do you think she's cruel? Mom! Are you willing to let your underage child suffer so much? Mom! I beg you not to let me go again! Mom! I sneaked out today; if I go back, I will definitely get another beating. Mom! Please do a good deed!" My younger brother was pleading with his mother. At the same time, tears hung down like strings of pearls.</p>
<p>My mother's lips moved. She probably agreed, right? But she didn't say anything. Immediately, she turned her head and her gaze shot at my father on the bamboo chair in the corner of the wall. It was as if she was asking: "What do you think?"</p>
<p>My father's face suddenly became stern, but the pain and sorrow in his heart could be expressed in his ruthless words and trembling voice.</p>
<p>"You think that's suffering? Then you must be a worthless thing. Look at the heroes and heroines of the past, which one of them didn't grow up in suffering? You probably know about the childhood lives of Yue Fei and Ouyang Xiu. You also understand the ancient saying: 'One must endure hardship to become a superior person,' right?" My father was obviously not agreeing. At the same time, he began to teach my younger brother:</p>
<p>"You know that at home now, we can't even eat a full porridge. You are now relying on temporary impulses; saying that you would rather starve to death at home. But when you taste real hunger, you will know how terrible hunger is, and Father wants to go out to work. But where will you go then? You need to know that work is not waiting for you! That's why I'm telling you to go now! I'm telling you to go immediately! You have to go! You have to go whether you want to or not!" These last few words were particularly heavy. My younger brother was so frightened that he stood aside, unable to say anything. I knew that these few words would definitely tie my younger brother's heart to the execution ground again. He was injured! Oh! Poor younger brother, you have suffered enough external injuries; now you have to suffer internal injuries. However, I hope you remember the cause of the injury.</p>
<p>These words had dispelled my mother's original intention. She was now starting to persuade my younger brother to go to work. However, her voice was so low. Even I couldn't hear it. However, I knew that she was repeatedly explaining my father's words. Moreover, she was using future happiness and wealth to lure my younger brother into the fire pit.</p>
<p>My younger brother was still unwilling to get up. I knew my father's temper. I knew that this kind of behavior would ignite my father's anger. Perhaps there would be unexpected actions. Then, the suffering my younger brother would endure would definitely be greater than before. Therefore, I had to go against my conscience and follow along in persuading my younger brother; telling him to endure it for a while. I promised to find a way to help him at any time. However, I myself knew; this was just a bubble!</p>
<p>My younger brother knew that he was not allowed at home, so he had no choice but to stand up and slowly walk back the way he had come. I watched my younger brother's back leave the door and couldn't help but sigh deeply.</p>
<p>My mother was already sobbing. My father's face was turning white. He sat on the bamboo chair without saying a word. After a long, long time, he sighed. And his eyes were a little red. I knew that my father's actions just now also went against his true feelings. But what better way was there?</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(6) Product of Love</p>
<p>"This method is very good. In a few days, let me go to the countryside myself." Begonia nodded continuously and said.</p>
<p>Xiangqi didn't say anything, first turned her body, changed the direction, and turned her back to the window, facing the two open small doors. In the past few days, cloth curtains had been hung outside the door. They were made of gray-green homespun cloth. In the middle of the two layers of cloth, there were also some thin cotton batting. Two horizontal wooden strips about an inch wide were nailed on the top and bottom to press down the curtain feet so that they would not be blown up by the wind. Not only was the style already old, but the color of the cloth also looked very dull.</p>
<p>"It's really not good for you to go yourself," Xiangqi said, pondering. "If you leave Beijing often, the people under you will find it strange; but it's not appropriate to send a lot of money to the countryside suddenly. It's best to send twenty or thirty dollars back first, and ask your uncle to act as a middleman and let him come to you to discuss..."</p>
<p>Before she could finish her words, there was a sudden sound of footsteps, and the mute girl had already pulled open the curtain and walked in.</p>
<p>"Ah...ah...yah..." She piled on a very innocent smile, and as soon as she entered the room, she started gesticulating to Xiangqi, and a kind of unintelligible sound was barely emitted from her throat.</p>
<p>Xiangqi had been living with her, and she herself had almost become a mute, gesturing and watching gestures, which was easier for her than talking.</p>
<p>"She said that the coal shop has delivered two baskets of coal, and asked us to go outside and take a look and pay them." She explained with a smile to Begonia, who was clueless.</p>
<p>Begonia couldn't help but smile. No matter how clever he was, he couldn't have imagined that the few gestures made by the mute girl would contain so many meanings.</p>
<p>"In this way, her acting is simply more delicate than ours in operas!" He said jokingly as he walked out of the room with them.</p>
<p>Xiangqi didn't hear him. She was walking in front with the little girl side by side, gesturing to each other all the way, and walking through the yard; Begonia picked up a copy of the Tianjin Business Daily of the day from the dining table in the hall, held it in her hand, and flipped through it randomly.</p>

<h3>I Have a Mother</h3>
<p>— Chen Huping</p>
<p>I have a mother, but I don't get any maternal love. Out of sympathy, and also for my conscience, I sacrificed what people call the greatest maternal love. I am already in the third year of high school this year, but whether I will continue my studies after graduation next year is still a question. Because my mother is doing her best to destroy my future in front of my father.</p>
<p>In addition to my parents and seven younger siblings, there is also an elderly grandmother and a weak aunt in the family. The family's life depends entirely on my father, which has aroused my mother's pride and expanded my mother's power. Everything about my grandmother and aunt is completely in her hands. First, she cut off their source of income, and my aunt's schooling also stopped. Secondly, she slandered and made slanderous remarks in front of my father. Although my father is a filial son, his love for his wife has overcome his filial piety. Needless to say, several younger siblings are of course accomplices in helping the wicked and following the trend. If they observe a little language, they will report it to my mother. If I stood on the same front as my mother, then I would become her favorite eldest daughter, and my material enjoyment would be several times better than it is now. But God! How can I go against my conscience and further destroy my grandmother, who is nearing the end of her life, and my aunt, who is lonely and helpless? I sympathize with their situation and pity their incompetence. I don't want to attack them in order to please my mother. My mother often laments that she has raised a daughter in vain and has not gained a single yuan. Since then, she has gradually become estranged from me, and often scolds me for some trivial matters. My temper is extremely stubborn, so that I offended my mother in my words. So a charge of "unfilial" was added to my head. My father originally loved me very much, but now, after hearing my mother's words, he has gradually become discouraged and disappointed in me. So now I am a child who has lost my father's favor and my mother's love.</p>
<p>I am secretly worried about my mother, because she will also live with her daughters-in-law in the future, relying on her sons to live.</p>

<h3>"Bittersweet Serenade"</h3>
<p>— Deng Shiying</p>
<p>Those who watch musical films to watch the opera will mostly be disappointed. On the one hand, the author has to take care of the opera, but on the other hand, he has to "insert" singing as much as possible. As a result, he loses sight of one thing and the other, and in the end sacrifices the opera, and even, like a hunchback falling, he doesn't get a foothold at both ends, so that the audience gains nothing. Films like "Evergreen" and "Peach Blossom Hate" are one in a hundred in musical films. The reason is that, in addition to the beautiful songs themselves, there are relatively few songs inserted.</p>
<p>"Bittersweet Serenade", said to be the last collaboration between Jeannette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, is a color film and is also "a trilogy written, composed, and lyricized by the master of drama, Noel Coward. However, I am not interested in this opera: there are as many as eleven songs inserted in "Bittersweet Serenade", but the only one that impressed me was I'll See you again. The film stock spent on singing limited the development of the dramatic scenes and made many of the plays become transitions, which is one thing. Secondly, in terms of the story, a young girl abandons her comfortable life and rich husband and elopes with a poor music teacher, living a life of "peaceful and poor heart", even becoming a street singer; all this should be good dramatic material, but what we see in the scenes and colors is too rich and warm, so the original joy in suffering is destroyed, and even the final "Sarah sings this song every time, as if accompanied by Karl", also weakens the resonance.</p>
<p>Jeannette MacDonald changed several costumes in the opera. Although these costumes were brightly colored and had good styles, they were out of tune with the plot. This may be the same as the director. The color film harmed her, thinking that it was not enough to show the characteristics of the color film without being rich and magnificent, but she did not think that what gave people a good impression in terms of color in "Bittersweet Serenade" started from the scene of performing Karl's posthumous work in simple brown at the end.</p>
<p>Speaking of acting, MacDonald's static plays are better than her dynamic ones. For example, in the play in the small hotel, we feel that MacDonald's singing and acting are not unrestrained enough. On the contrary, in the play where she rehearsed her husband's posthumous work, she stood by the piano and cried involuntarily. She was forced to suppress her emotions and finally burst out, which was much better. Nelson Eddy is still the same, a singer, and we rarely have the opportunity to see him act.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain, Exquisite Flower</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Five: The Red Skirt Envies the Pomegranate Flower</p>
<p>As soon as Tong Tianbao saw Li Xin, he bowed to him and said, "Master Li, I hope you have been well. My sister has offended you; please don't take it to heart." Upon hearing these words, Li Xin couldn't help but blush, saying, "It is due to my, Li's, incompetence that I have come to this. Now that I am captured, kill me if you wish, there's no need for further words." Tong Tianbao laughed heartily, pulled over a stool, and sat across from Li Xin. Stroking his chin, he said, "Master Li, do not speak in such anger. My sister and I have long heard of Master Li's fame and hold the utmost sincerity. Therefore, we decided earlier that my sister and I would rely on your esteemed name to start a rebellion together. We disguised ourselves as itinerant performers and went to Qi County to take the opportunity to pay our respects to you and tell you our intentions. Who knew that you would not accept our words, causing us to make a wasted trip. However, my sister could not forget you, and therefore, this time, she brought the brothers from the mountain to attack Qi County, with the sole purpose of obtaining you, Master Li. Fortunately, my sister has invited you here. We now request that you reside here and work together on great things, hoping you will no longer decline. Furthermore, I have a presumptuous matter to ask you to agree to; that is, my sister Tianfeng is already nineteen years old this year and has not yet been betrothed. Her martial skills are very strong, whether on horseback or on foot, she excels in both. She compares herself to figures like Hua Mulan and Liang Hongyu. Because she was born with a fondness for red things, she always wears red flowers, red dresses, red shoes, red rouge, and rides a red horse, hence she has earned the nickname 'Red Maiden.' These three words are known everywhere along the Yellow River, which shows that she is no ordinary woman. Therefore, she wants to marry a hero so as not to disgrace her life. Master Li is accomplished in both literary and martial arts, and is chivalrous and righteous, a Mencius and Lord Pingyuan of this generation. My sister is willing to serve you and establish a marital bond between our Li and Tong families. Please grant these two requests and do not decline." After Tong Tianbao finished speaking, he clasped his hands, quietly awaiting Li Xin's reply. Hearing this, Li Xin finally understood that his capture was entirely due to the Red Maiden's intention, no wonder they treated him so favorably. However, how could he possibly submit to being a bandit? (34)</p>

<h3>Final News</h3>
<p>After Xun Huisheng's golden contract expires, he will enter the Xin Xin stage. The decision on the "bubble play" has been delayed. It is now learned that Xin Xin hosted a banquet for the Xun Opera Troupe at the International Hotel yesterday, discussing it for a long time before a solution was reached. The list of plays is as follows, to comfort Xun's fans.</p>
<p>The Sixteenth Night: "Great British Martyr," the Seventeenth Night: "Fish and Duckweed Palace," the Eighteenth Night: "Buried Fragrance Illusion," the Nineteenth Night: "Substituting Husband Matchmaker," the Twentieth Day: "　 Spring Marriage," the Night: "Lantern Festival Riddle."</p>
<p>Jin Yan, Wang Renmei</p>
<h3>To Perform "Song of Rejuvenation"</h3>
<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>After Jin Yan and Wang Renmei finished filming Sun Yu's "Sky 　 Miles" in Chongqing and returned to Hong Kong, they have been idle until now. Recently, news has come that they will star in "Song of Rejuvenation."</p>
<p>"Song of Rejuvenation" was written by Tian Han. When this play was performed at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater under the name of the Meiyu Drama Association seven or eight years ago, its momentum was so great that it was not only unprecedented but also unparalleled. Almost all of today's renowned red film actors were included. The vigorous development of Chinese drama today owes a great debt to this performance.</p>
<p>Now, this famous stage play of the time will be brought to the screen by Xianggang Xin Sheng Company. On stage, the lead actors of "Song of Rejuvenation" were Jin Yan and Wang Renmei. Taking advantage of their presence in Hong Kong, it has been decided to invite them to play the leading roles on the screen as well. The director has already been internally appointed as Situ Huimin. Situ Huimin was originally scheduled to direct "Love of the Motherland," but has now passed it on to Tan Youliu. As for Cai Chusheng's "New Life," it will probably have to wait until these two productions begin filming before proceeding.</p>
<p>"Song of Rejuvenation" and "Love of the Motherland" are both about the lives of overseas Chinese, so the location shooting team will go to Manila or Singapore to shoot on location to achieve authenticity.</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Develops South American Culture</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuan</p>
<p>The U.S. government's national policy of developing cultural and commercial ties with South American countries is being implemented in all aspects with unremitting efforts. Recently, a government official in charge of film affairs, Whitney, personally went to Hollywood, with the aim of finding ways to use films to assist in the development of this connection.</p>
<p>Major film companies, following the government's will, are making efforts in this area separately. For example, "The March of Time" and "Pathé News" short film photographers have decided to produce multiple short films with South America as the background; Paramount Pictures has also sent photographer Arleigh to South America to capture news (when Japanese planes bombed the American gunboat Panay on the Yangtze River in 1937, Arleigh filmed the process).</p>
<p>In addition, various film companies will compete to shoot feature films with Central and South America as the themes, sending teams to shoot on location at any time, and inviting major stars to join them to facilitate communication. Regarding this point, it is said that James Roosevelt's (son of U.S. President 　 Roosevelt) first film "Pot O' Gold" may have its world premiere in Mexico City, and Hollywood film industry figures will be invited to go to Mexico City to attend the film's premiere.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>— Jue Xin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Actors' Association's Property Protection Review Committee has redeemed all the properties of Liyuanfang. It is now continuing to handle the fair pricing and will soon perform a free show. Perhaps they will perform the spoken drama "Family," but this has not yet been determined. Originally, the Four Banks small group of the Actors' Association was preparing to hold a celebration banquet to reward the personnel who contributed to the Property Protection Committee. However, Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baisui, and others all said that there was no need for this and hoped to allocate the funds for the "celebration banquet" to donate to the fair pricing. The small group has agreed with this proposal and has allocated one thousand yuan to the Property Protection Committee. This is another virtuous act after the redemption of Liyuanfang.</p>
<p>Civil and military veteran Liu Wenkui, having left the Tianchan stage　, accepted the invitation of the Xianshi Amusement Park Peking Opera Theater and joined at the same time as Kun Dan Zhang Huicong. Recently, Huicong requested leave due to pregnancy, and Wenkui also felt that working in the amusement park was a situation where a hero had no use for his martial skills, so he resigned from the troupe to the authorities. It is set to end at the end of this month. He has already been invited by Xin Xin to join the cast of the two-part "New Journey to the West."</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>The drama department of the Huasheng Company in this city will hold a spring short play performance at the Russian Art Theater from April 14th to 16th. The plays include "Moonrise," directed by Ying Yin, "The Dilapidated Villa," co-starred by reporters Mao Yu, Wu Yongzi, Chen Mingdong, Mu Yilong, and Shen Qi, and five short plays, including Tian Han's famous works "Flood" and "Tragedy on the Lake."</p>
