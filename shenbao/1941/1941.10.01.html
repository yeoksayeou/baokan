<p>前線澈夜激戰日軍陷入重圍　粵華軍克復三埠臺山等要地</p>
<p>重慶　軍息、（一）湘北南犯日因某面遭華軍堅强阻擊、乃倣效歐戰使用降落傘部隊、企圖向華後方擾亂、二十七日瀏陽河岸東屯渡曾降落日傘兵三十餘人、東山（長沙東）地區亦降落一小部、均為花悉數擊斃、（二）長沙外圍東北地區戰事、三十日激烈異常、華大軍以合圍之勢、向日猛烈反擊、極爲得手、現繼續向日猛攻中、（三）華某某等强勁部隊、向日後到處突擊、三十晨在三姐橋附近地區、截獲日二中輜重大隊、當將日掩護部隊包圍擊退、所有　藥及眾用品、悉爲華鹵獲、爲數至鉅、（三十日電）</p>
<p>重慶　據華方消息、今晨接長沙直接電話、謂戰局無變動、華軍仍堅守城北之陣綫、各師錢澈夜激戰不輟、中日兩軍皆閉於汨羅江與撈刀河中間之區域、從事惡鬥、其結果將決定長沙之命運、湘錢華軍總司令薛岳將軍電稱、我方吸引日軍入長沙東北區以消減戰之計畫、現已實現、匪特長沙仍在我方之手、日軍目爲我軍包圍、日軍彈藥與糧食漸罄、數日之內可告肅淸、此間消息靈通各界之意、長沙命運、將在一週內決定、華方發表關於長沙之消息、極爲審愼、力圖示其眞相、宣傳部部長王士杰昨日下午招待新聞記者之前、曾親致電話與薛岳將軍、而得最近之消息與發展、中國軍事發言人謂、長沙之存亡、較諸大戰之結果、並不重要、故中國當局無發表虛僞消息之情由、據今日長沙華方來報、謂長沙華常局昨日殷待日人所組織外國新聞記者團之至、但該團終未到臨、華方殊爲失望、蓋華方豫備予以熱烈之歡迎也、中國軍事當局今日非笑日人所傳日軍已佔據株州之說、謂最近之日軍現尙距城北至少四十哩、據長沙另一消息、九月二十八日之夜、另一日兵支隊進抵長沙東北郊、即被華軍包圍解決之、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　港訊、日方一再宣傳佔領長沙·株州·實則完全係造謠、各方咸不置信、日方同盟社、二十九晚發表華中日軍總司令部公布消息、謂日軍以任務完畢、已於二十九午退出株州城、足證日軍前决所稱佔領株州、純屬虛構、毫無根據、（三十日電）</p>
<p>重慶　中央社稱、據韶關消息、西江之三埠·長沙·新昌·狄海、及台山均已克復、（三十日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　記者以中外人士對湘北大戰極爲關心、因走訪軍事發言人、叩詢其意見、承告此事不必另加論列、頃接薜長官（岳）來電、可代表一切、其電略謂、「我原計畫誘日至長沙東北地區、使其進入我預設之陷阱中而聚殲之、不意現竟如料實現、刻不僅長沙安全確在我手、而來犯日軍巳被我重重包圍、加之强盡糧絕、黔驢之技巳窮、相信數日之內、定可殺其片甲不留」等語、巳可概見、至關於日人迭謠一節、但未見有若此决之完全無稽者、如所發表之佔領長沙佔領株州等、眞是嚮壁虛迭云云、（二十九日電）、</p>
<p>重慶　今日午後、有中國偵察機一架、由湘省前綫飛回、報告長沙大火、據其他方面之消息、則謂此項大火、係由於日機之轟炸、因今日下午重慶所接獲之最近戰訊、報告長沙仍在華軍手中、且在目前進行之血戰中、華軍巳漸得優勢也、消息靈通方面宜稱、戰事結果、似將於此後兩日內決定之、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　可靠方面消息、長沙華軍巳經增援、今日淸晨開始反攻、戰况激烈、此間頗抱樂觀、日軍傘兵三十人前日在株州降落、當即悉數就俘、此即日方所稱佔領之實况、（三十日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>長沙　長沙外圍戰况、甚爲激烈、兩軍互殺一團、日軍受創極重、現九嶺·平江·營田·湘陰、均仍在堅守中、又汨羅江及撈刀河兩岸華軍、允爲活躍、其竄至長沙城郊之一部、刻正爲華軍個別圍擊、（二十九日電）</p>
<p>衡陽　日機廿九日兩次襲衡、一次五架由鄂飛衡窺探、一次三架、由粵竄衡、於十一時五十分在衡投彈二次後、仍向粵南逸去、並在　縣投彈、（二十九日電）</p>
<p>長沙城內　並無日旗</p>
<p>合衆社特派員麥克杜格爾發、余本日乘日本飛機、飛臨長沙、歷十分鐘、、見該城雖無新受損害之象、但似已成爲鬼城、華軍及日軍最近似皆未損害長沙、余係偕其他記者、及上海日軍發言人、乘日本運輸飛機臨長沙上空、余覺長沙似已極爲荒凉、街道上行人僅有數人、余數之得五人、在某處兩大通衢之交义處、則聚有數百人、似爲軍隊所驅聚者、余曾見美國旗飛揚於沿湘江岸邊之油池、及建築物之上、油池所在房屋之庭院、則書有U.S.A三字、合衆社編者按、麥氏來訊、並未提及見有日旗、通常日軍於剛佔領華方城市後、必有無數日旗懸掛）、除美國旗外、余尚見有法國旗一面、余並曾飛臨長沙南面三十二英里之株州、該處之日軍於昨日退去、余曾見有多處燃燒、乃係當吾人自岳州乘飛機赴長沙時、所投之炸彈所引起者、在漢口時、美總領事史畢克君謂余云、自週末以來、即未接彼等之消息、余等在此機塲時、曾見日本之轟炸機、及戰鬥機繼續起飛、（卅日電）</p>
<p>日師團長　兩人陣亡</p>
<p>重慶　可靠軍界咋晚宣稱、日軍離粵漢鐵路及浙贛鐵路交叉點之株州以北、最少尚有六十公哩、並否認日軍已佔領長沙、該方面絕對聲稱、日方所稱株州之佔領、「與日方所稱已於星期六進至長沙同屬無稽、」中央社之湘北前錢消息稱、日軍第四師團司令北野、在粟橋戰區陣亡、彼係由華軍司令李煜堂（即前書參加台兒莊戰役者）部所尋獲、該電訊又稱、日軍第三師團司令豐島、亦於星期六在黃岡戰區陣亡、中央社之湘北前綫消息又稱、華軍咋日在長沙西北解決日軍一隊，奪得戰馬數百頭云、（三十日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　據未證實之華方消息、日軍已於是役中陣亡師長二人、一爲第四師團長北野陸軍少將、一爲第三師團長豐島陸軍少將、二人均死於長沙城北、聞北野之屍已爲華軍覓得、（三十日路透社電）</p>
<p>外籍記者　未曾到達</p>
<p>長沙　上海外國記者若干人、乘日本軍用機飛往長沙者、愆期已久、昨今兩日猶未見抵此、華當局謂、此等著名記者、將受甚大之歡迎、並將得華軍兀許、參觀全城、及其四周、據指稱、外間謠傳、該城及其四郊、於上星期六即被日軍佔領、華軍總司令部今夜發表公報稱、長沙北郊及西北郊、現正發生「決戰」、華軍優勢與時俱增、日軍現正陷入華軍包圍、華司令深信、此後數日內、日軍將全滅、且重行聲明、長沙仍由華軍堅守、（此電由長沙於九月二十九日下午八時拍發、）又按、上海赴長沙記者爲大美晚報主筆奧拍、美聯社記者李克拉、合衆社記者麥道格爾、德國記者二人、及日軍發言人秋山、彼等行程、預定四日、（二十九日國際社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c6">莫斯科的三強會議 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>前天開始在莫斯科舉行的英、美、蘇三強會議、突然一下、就把侵略勢力方面對蘇聯西綫猛攻及東邊壓力同時發動、使會議延緩開幕的最後一綫幻想、又完全打破了。德軍的攻下基輔、以及日、蘇邊境的緊張、都沒有發生什麼妨碍作用；相反地、英美却立即表示了加強的姿態、代表們迅速到達了莫斯科。這一點、是侵略者現在不得不加以深長省悟的！嚴格說來、在立塲方面、英、蘇同盟協定後、加上美國一再鄭重表示援蘇、而羅、邱會議裏、又共同正式向蘇聯提出了三強會議的召集、那末、現在的會議。本是牠們之間關係發展中一個必有的階段。不宜一在物資接濟方面、英、美的大量軍器與原料、本來也有大量在運送之中、而不必等現在的莫斯科會議。這次莫斯科會議其所以成爲國際非常重大事件、而值得我們予以注意的、第一、是在於表明英、美、蘇三國澈底合作擊潰侵略者的誠意與精神。第二、牠將使三國間未來的實際合作方式與規模、展開一個完全嶄新的面目。</p>
<p>從侵略者方面看、假如牠們的對面大敵、始終是中、英、美、蘇等所有正義力量的總結合、那末、無論牠們施行怎樣的戰略、運用怎樣的戰具、其結果總逃不出一個同樣的失敗。這一層、本是今天所有國際觀察者的共同結論、早已成爲一般簡明的常識了。而侵略者致勝迷夢實現的唯一可能、還是幻想各個擊破這一點、也是相同明瞭的。可是我們換一個方向、從正義陣綫本身方面去看、英、美、蘇、三國間今天這樣的合作形勢、却誠然不得不算爲空前的盛舉！這樣值得全人類重視和寶貴的舉措、首先、是說明了國家民族及政府上各種分歧的弱點、到底要被對於世界整個進步的考慮所克服、也證明了人類的前途畢竟是趨向光明；其次、我們還可以說、沒有英·英·美·蘇三國今天那樣有眼光、有定見、有魄力的當局們來主持、這一舉當然也不可能的、這又正是說明了羅斯福、邱吉爾、斯達林等人的卓越。一般地說起來、英·美·蘇三國。與德·義·日三國之間、個別的妥協與綏靖大門、一直到今天、並沒有完全關閉。而比較困難的、是在於英·美·蘇三國能在今天一致認清了、在侵略者各個擊破的戰術下、牠們絕無單獨存在的途徑、這是一。更不容易的、是牠們居然一致放棄了彼此間多年來的態度、與對於彼此未來關係的固執見解、而認定完全有合作改造世界的可能與義務、這是二。再向前推進一步、立足於全人類文明的前進上、於是又在切實地考量著改造世界的具體方案、則更是難得的現象了、這是三。而英·美·蘇三國的領袖們、居然能在認準了途徑之後、毅然向著目標邁進、這樣的國家領袖、二十世紀以前的任何時代、大概都不會產生的、所以構成了空前所未有的莊嚴壯烈的景象、這是四。最後還有一點、爲我們所不得不認清、而值得予以特別指明的、就是、三國中除了蘇聯的獨裁制下、人民的一部份偏見不足以構成當局者舉動的障礙外、英·美兩國皆是民治的國家。以英·美向來那樣一部份對蘇偏見派的有力、羅斯福與邱吉爾居然能貫澈他們的主張、除了這兩人外、恐怕當代的任何英·美政治家、也得不到一般國民這樣無條件的信任。這一些、都是於分析當前莫斯科會議時、令人不得不想起來的處所。</p>
<p>據莫斯科的電訉、這次三強會議裏所涉及的範圍、並不僅僅以物質的接濟蘇聯爲限。牠將要討論到的主要項目、最要緊的、是英·美·蘇三國整個戰略的配合問題、從這裏、要決定了牠們在本年和一九四二年戰事進行的大概方針、其次是三國間軍器軍需及原料的調整交換問題、再其次、方是最現實迫切的對蘇聯當前所需戰具的迅速供給。從這個會議的來源上看、牠是出於三國最高當局的一致發動與同意、而這次出席會議的三國代表、也幾乎是綱羅了政治·經濟·海軍·陸軍·空軍等各方面的重要人物、所以牠定可負起作重大決定的重責、而進一步實際予以推行、當然是不待說的。在目前會議正在進行的過程中、除了實際器具及資源的問題外、這時全世界人士們心頭上所盤旋著、大概不外三個：（一）英·蘇聯合對德·義發動大反攻的方式與時間。（二）對東西兩組暴力予以澈底解決次序的先後。（三）美國實際參戰的原則方式與遲早。以當前的軍事形勢看、英·蘇的海空軍、無疑的、居於壓倒的優勢；陸軍聯合力量與德·義的對比對怎樣、現在還難確切論斷。但無論如何、對德·義反攻、是可能而且必要的、現在所少的、就是牽掣到東方的形勢、因而又要涉及到美國實際參加戰鬥的問題、在將來莫斯科會議圓滿閉幕後、我們希望有更大規模的、國際所有正義力量的會議、也可以接著召集起來。</p>

<p>日方宣稱、已於二十七日下午六時半進入長沙、華方第九戰區司令長官薛岳、二十六日即赴衡陽、嗣又謂赴常德、又稱日軍一部已越過長沙、向南追擊、二十九日到達株州、但均經中國軍事當局堅決否認、並稱薛氏現仍在長沙坐鎭、以薛氏二十九日尚由長沙用長途電話、向重慶中國最高統率部報告前綫戰况、說明日軍在長沙東北、被華軍包圍、即可肅淸、足證日方宣傳、完全不確、</p>
<p>西報記者　被邀飛湘</p>
<p>但日方爲誇大日軍在湘北戰績、曾由「日本派遣車報導部長」秋水中佐、激同本埠英文大美晚報主筆兼基督科學講壇報駐滬記者奧潑爾·美聯社記者李氏·合衆社記者麥特戈爾·及德籍記者二人、於一十九日由滬乘飛機出發、雖稱目的地爲長沙、但所定行程、爲三十日由漢口至岳州、三十日午、乘飛機視察日軍「佔領」下之長沙一帶、一日下午返滬、並未說明是吾在長沙降落</p>
<p>長沙人士　久候未到</p>
<p>證之作日英文大美晚報第一版所載國際社二十日收到二十九日晚八時由長沙所發之電訊、則可知現在長沙之中國車事當局、固甚歡迎西報記者光臨、惜日機未必在該處降落耳、據國際社之電訊稱｜「長沙人士昨今（廿八日廿九日）二日、靜候上海外籍新聞記者搭乘日本軍用飛機來此、惟迄未到達、此間華方當局稱、彼等極歡迎此　著名新聞記者、並將田中國軍隊特許、招待彼等遊覽全城及郊外、</p>
<p>日軍已陷　包圍之中</p>
<p>據稱、自上周六起、外間即盛傳長沙及其外圍、已被日軍攻入、昨夜華軍司令部公報稱、長沙城北外圍、現已進入決定性之大戰、華軍較佔優勢、據稱、日軍已陷入華方所布置之包圍、華方司令預料日軍日內將敗退、普堅稱華軍刻仍固守長沙、</p>
<p>事實證明　株州未陷</p>
<p>長沙方面戰况、就中日雙方所公布之報告觀之、華方旣確切聲明長沙猶在堅守中、而日文則不特謂長沙已被佔領、且已攻陷湘粵贛效能中心點之株州、證之過云情形、華軍如果失守某一地區、從未加以諱飾、今華方對長旣以堅定口氣、否認失陷、而日方則仍作無往不利之宣傳、乃令各方人士、莫不深感奇異、惟事實逐漸證明者、關於日軍攻陷株州之說、依據日文報紙記載、前夜日本華中軍司令部已宣布因任務完成而退出矣、日文此一退出之說、與華軍當局堅稱株州未失之說、固相符合、而日軍所稱任務完成而退出者、遂令人大惑不解、據此間觀察家稱、株州爲湘省交通要道、即在日方、亦認爲該處乃相省軍事與經齊之要衝、今日方旣經佔據，何以又輕輕放棄並非咋戰史上之奇跡乎、且日軍如果佔領株州、即可爲長沙之屏障、在戰略上亦萬無放棄之理由、</p>
<p>日方交通　已被切斷</p>
<p>又據日文報紙之另記載稱、華方援軍、因不知長沙失陷、仍復　湧而來、遂被日軍邀擊於長沙之北、在日文宣稱、日軍係從長沙東方攻入、則華軍後路頗成問題、又何能向北方挺進、故日謂已佔領長沙之說、殊難可信、此外日方又承認長沙東北之平江、與湘北之大雲山等處、均有激戰、日機並向大雲山華軍大肆轟炸、凡此情形、竟與華方所稱湘北日軍交通已被切斷、華軍正對進攻長沙日軍展開大包圍之說完全符合、可不攻自破也、</p>

<p>— 平野</p>
<p>請工商界一讀</p>
<p>讀港報，紀述日光管的發明，其中有我工業界的一頁傷心史，爲着紀念這位苦心研究未竟其志的中國靑年，爲着策勉我們今日上海的工業界，特爲錄出：</p>
<p>「……日光管最先發明人，是上海一家燈泡廠靑年學馮某，馮有研究科學天，一日看見一段巳經損壞之霓燈管，在廠中取得發射電子之化學藥品，乃在無意中研究得一結果，認定電管可不必用絲，亦能發光。遂根據此理，發明一種無絲燈泡，廠主見其終日埋頭於此，貽誤職務，立將其試騐器具拋棄，馮當將經過說出，求其資助，廠主不惟不助，且予驅逐。馮離廠後，四出求人投資，勉集二一千元，惟不敷購置器村，試騐結果，發光而不亮，難以持久，馮刺激渦甚，生活煎迫，且工作過劇，遂咯血而亡」。</p>
<p>讀了這一段紀載，我們的感想，先要聲明的不是以阿Ｑ心理，來辯白西洋文明還在東方文明之後，倒是證明東方文明的科學研究，實在缺乏社會國家的幫助，馮君生長在這個環境，就成了咯血而亡的無名英雄，現在美國日光管來滬了，大家迎新送舊，忻然享用，甚至這家燈泡廠，懍於燈泡營業的前途，或者也己裝用日光燈，或者正聘模仿家在那裹希冀「照辦」，這是如何的感慨，也是如何的痛心一件事。</p>
<p>我們聯想到各業從業員埋首苦幹的人，還有不少，我們也曾爲培植他們的向學，這决特地舉辦了工商從業員助學金，在此我們更確信我們力量的微薄，有待獎進的工商從業員，實在眞是不少。</p>
<p>工業界的先生們，時代督促我們科學救國，希望你們在營業上着想以外，對於靑年嘔盡心血什苦心研究的從業員加以愛護或幫助，萬一無力幫助，只要他們的研究，確有相當意義與結果，也應替他介紹到社會上，以期待社會人士熱誠的贊助。</p>
<p>馮君咯血而亡了，日光管也由國外運來了，希望永遠再不看見這「類厄於環境埋沒靑年的紀載，則馮君雖然日光管發明未成，也就是發明了以後的一切，替以後的發明家塡平這一段古老崎嶇的道路。</p>
<p>晚上，關鬥掃地，移開襪機，架上舖板，權作宿舍，祇要樓上不發脾氣，總能呼呼入睡，一早醒來，「倒老爺高聲叫喊」，我的工作便開始了，有人問我你「日與塵埃爲伍，夜與蚤蝨爲伴」的生活，覺得怎樣？我笑着回答說：「你莫要小看呢？廠中的女工，當我是工程師廠長帳房先生哩！」你想，我離了該廠，誰處有道位置候缺呢？</p>
<h3 id="c78">生活圈里　眞是能者多勞　工程師·廠長·帳房 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 竺迅</p>
<p>在這摩登的上海社會會裏，誰信會有十八世紀式的弄堂工廠，我很榮幸能在工廠中就職；一天到晚地忙着，帳房是我，管理員是我，老司務是我，連掃地倒痰盂的亦是我，甚至替老闆娘抱小囝買點心的亦是我，說來大權在握，滿面風光，祇落得二十元大洋鈿，你想廠中待遇好不好呢？</p>
<p>說來亦許會令人不信吧！莫耍小看一幢一下的房屋，樓上呢作了老闆的住宅，亭子間呢作了堆存貨物的棧房，全部的樓下，作阿瑟廠的廠屋，從天井到灶披，安置生產的源流—搖洋襪機，講到露臺，當然廚房了；從上到下，從前到後，老闆總算費了腦經，建設這樣一個怪怪叫的襪廠了。</p>
<p>地方雖小，生意倒很忙，好個夜工日工，轆轆之聲，與女工談笑聲，互歌行答；閒來無事與女工談談白相，老闆娘看見，又要一陣白眼，「小鬼小鬼」亂駡山門。</p>
<p>一天到晚，忙着記帳，送貨，包紮，採購，抱小囝，叫點心，倒痰盂，點貨色……有時老闆娘貴忙，則買小菜，生火爐，亦要一人包辦，眞是雙手包辦一切，花旦凈生，樣樣皆做。</p>
<p>老闆晏起遲睡，十時起身，出外接洽廠務，每天午夜回家，不是在外「义八圈」便是「跑公司找女茶房」，半夜裹老闆娘大發脾氣，鬧得天花板下的電燈錢搖個不定，忽然「砰！忽然硼！」老闆娘兩脚在天花板上跳得屋中的老鼠，不敢竄出來，滿地都是碎玻片，老板娘脾氣愈發得利害，老闆却愈逍遙法外」！</p>

<p>張老六坐在堂屋裏，看他們一齊走過對街去，給孟老掌櫃的像接上司一樣的迎進裹面去，直到兩點多鐘才出來。</p>
<p>「老孟這樣的巴結他們，不要再想出旁的花樣來！」張老六很祖心地跟他主人討論着。</p>
<p>秋海棠聽了，倒也很焦急，但玉崑却並不曾再回來，使他要找他商量也不能。</p>
<p>幸而天可憐他，這一重心事也並沒有讓他躭得怎樣久，當晚九點鐘，老孟便帶着他的兒媳悄悄地走過來了。</p>
<p>「吳大哥還沒有安息嗎？」他一走進房，便堆着滿臉的笑向秋海棠招呼着。</p>
<p>秋海棠當然也不便冷淡他，彼此便很親熱地寒喧了一陣。</p>
<p>「我想跟你說幾句心腹話，吳大哥，請你敎小狗子的兄弟出去坐　一會行不行？」孟老頭兒特地從一張椅子上站起來，移到秋海棠的坑上去坐着，神氣倒相當的誠懇。</p>
<p>不等秋海棠說話，張老六一聽，便自動走了出去，孟家的小內掌一櫃還特地把房門也推上了。（二二五）</p>

<p>何太太今朝起來，覺得身體「斜氣」不舒服；因爲她昨天晚上打麻將，打得太晚的原故。她於是決意去見醫生。</p>
<p>醫生說：「太太的病完全是太過勞苦所致，你應該時常沐浴，多吸點新鮮的空氣，和改穿些舒服一點的薄衣裳。」</p>
<p>何太太回到家裹的時候，何先生早巳在門外等候着細心問道：「親愛的，醫生怎樣吩咐你呢？」</p>
<p>「醫生說，要時常到海濱浴塲去享受太陽浴，要多坐一點汽車，和做些新式合時的衣裳。」</p>
<p>於是一向並不漂亮的何先生又皺了皺眉毛說：「眞的！那才是女性最普遍的流行病呀！」</p>

<p>棋師之座，相當於東洋九段，應先聯合國內奕家，一致推尊吳清源氏爲吾國棋師，亦即吾國奕之第一任棋師。（棋師以上仍可假定棋聖棋仙等等尊號留以有待）並請吾國現存之高手，各將奕稿寄請棋師審閱，定其品第，以爲白黑及授子之比例。其三棋座及三學位之升晉，應由棋師主之。其九等棋士之升晉，則請棋師指定國內之棋會機關，以司其事。均以比賽之成績，爲進等等標準。至於比賽規則及時刻計算與分數計算，應由國內奕家詳細參酌規定，寄請棋師審核後，以爲定律。如荷吳氏允任棋師，而國內奕家，又能遵以奉行，則吾國奕界即爲稍有組織，庶有漸漸興隆之望。人才之出，本屬可遇而不可求，若常此散漫，雖有可造之才，亦不能得指導升晋之便利，即失却儘量發展之機會，甚爲可惜！此事固與國家社會及經濟狀况，均有關連，茲亦不及備論也。</p>
<p>棋會之組織，實爲當務之急，應定名爲中國圍棋會，或圍棋學會。聞最近本埠會成立圍棋會，並經邀請名手顧水如·魏海鴻·王幼宸諸君，不時對局，似應請諸名手將所留之圖，寄請吳清源氏評講發刊，藉以增進奕界之興趣。並盼國內之提侶圍棋者，勿徒視爲業餘之消遣，而應同時兼謀學藝之增進，及人才之養成，則有造於奕界，殊爲宏遠矣。</p>

<p>高老太爺旣然沒有法子把覺民我回來，而對於蘊華方面的事，亦隱的有聞，自以爲家長的威信，已掃地無餘，心裹早醞釀着一種不快活，恰當這時，覺新的五叔父高克定，在外面在嫖濫賭，認識了一個土娼，居然共賦同居，列爲外室。因爲虧累過鉅，甚至連自己妻子的飾物都弄出去變賣了。高老太爺知道了這件事，這一氣更非同小可，雖然盡力地把克定敎訓了一番，可是高老太爺也病倒了。</p>
<p>高老太爺的病勢，一天天沉重了。而覺民仍未回家，高老太爺知道自己勢將不起，漸漸有點覺悟了。於是，在一個星月無輝的晚上，把覺慧叫到病榻之前，表示了對覺民的諒解，自願取消與馮家的姻的，要覺慧把覺民找回來。覺慧知道這件事巳獲勝利，連忙去找覺民。同時，張師長因爲過於倒行逆施，爲上峯免職，勢力突呈瓦解。於是，張蘊華的事情，也不了自了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Chinese Army Firmly Defends the Chen Line North of Changsha; Little Change in the Battle Situation in Northern Hunan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Fierce Battles Overnight on the Front Lines; Japanese Troops Heavily Besieged; Cantonese Chinese Forces Recover Key Areas such as Sanbu and Taishan</p>
<p>Chongqing News: (1) The Japanese forces invading southern Hunan Province have met with strong resistance from the Chinese army on several fronts. They are now imitating European warfare by using parachute troops in an attempt to disrupt the Chinese rear. On the 27th, more than 30 Japanese paratroopers landed on the east bank of the Liuyang River at Duntundu. A small unit also landed in the Dongshan (east of Changsha) area. All were killed by the Chinese army. (2) The battles in the northeastern outskirts of Changsha were extremely fierce on the 30th. The large Chinese army launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese forces in an encircling maneuver, achieving great success. They are now continuing to fiercely attack the Japanese forces. (3) Strong Chinese troops attacked the Japanese rear in various places. On the morning of the 30th, in the area near Sanjie Bridge, they intercepted a major Japanese 2nd Regiment supply column. They surrounded and defeated the Japanese escort troops, and all the ammunition, medicine, and supplies were captured by the Chinese forces in huge quantities. (Dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, a direct phone call was received from Changsha this morning stating that the battle situation remains unchanged. The Chinese army is still firmly defending the front line north of the city. Various divisions have been engaged in fierce battles all night long. Both the Chinese and Japanese armies are locked in a bitter struggle in the area between the Miluo River and the Laodao River. The outcome will determine the fate of Changsha. General Xue Yue, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese forces in Hunan, wired that the plan to lure the Japanese forces into the northeastern area of Changsha to reduce the war has now been realized. Not only is Changsha still in our hands, but the invading Japanese forces are now surrounded by our troops. The Japanese ammunition and food supplies are gradually being exhausted. It is expected that the area will be cleared within a few days. According to well-informed sources, the fate of Changsha will be decided within a week. The Chinese side is releasing news about Changsha with extreme caution, striving to show the truth. Before hosting a press conference yesterday afternoon, Minister of Propaganda Wang Shijie personally phoned General Xue Yue to obtain the latest news and developments. A Chinese military spokesperson stated that the survival of Changsha is not as important as the outcome of the entire war. Therefore, the Chinese authorities have no reason to release false news. According to reports from Changsha today, the Changsha Chinese authorities yesterday eagerly awaited the arrival of a foreign press corps organized by the Japanese, but the group never arrived. The Chinese side was very disappointed, as they had prepared a warm welcome. Chinese military authorities today scoffed at the Japanese claim that Japanese forces had occupied Zhuzhou, saying that the nearest Japanese troops are still at least forty miles north of the city. According to another report from Changsha, on the night of September 28, another Japanese detachment advanced to the northeastern suburbs of Changsha but was immediately surrounded and wiped out by the Chinese army. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Hong Kong news: Japanese claims of occupying Changsha and Zhuzhou are complete fabrications. No one believes them. The Japanese Domei News Agency released a statement on the evening of the 29th from the headquarters of the Japanese Central China Expeditionary Army, stating that the Japanese forces had completed their mission and withdrew from Zhuzhou City at noon on the 29th, proving that the Japanese forces' previous claim of occupying Zhuzhou was purely fictitious and without any basis. (Dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Central News Agency reported that Sanbu, Changsha, Xinchang, Di Hai on the West River, and Taishan have all been recovered. (United Press dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A reporter, seeing that Chinese and foreign people are extremely concerned about the Battle of Northern Hunan, visited the military spokesperson to inquire about his opinion. He told us that there was no need to add any comments. He received a telegram from Chief Executive Xue (Yue) which could represent everything. The telegram stated: "My original plan was to lure the Japanese to the northeastern region of Changsha, so that they would enter the trap I had set in advance and annihilate them. Unexpectedly, it has now been realized as expected. Not only is Changsha safe in our hands, but the invading Japanese troops have been heavily surrounded by us, and they are exhausted and out of supplies. I believe that within a few days, we will be able to kill every single one of them." This is clear. As for the Japanese repeated rumors, nothing is more completely unfounded than this, such as the announcements of occupying Changsha and occupying Zhuzhou, which are really just empty talk. (Dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This afternoon, a Chinese reconnaissance plane flew back from the front lines in Hunan Province, reporting a large fire in Changsha. According to other sources, the fire was caused by Japanese aircraft bombing. The latest battle news received in Chongqing this afternoon reports that Changsha is still in the hands of the Chinese army and that in the current bloody battle, the Chinese army has gradually gained the upper hand. Well-informed sources claim that the outcome of the battle seems likely to be decided within the next two days. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Reliable sources report that the Chinese army in Changsha has been reinforced and launched a counterattack this morning. The battle is fierce. There is considerable optimism here. Thirty Japanese paratroopers landed in Zhuzhou the day before yesterday and were all captured on the spot. This is the true picture of what the Japanese call occupation. (Havas dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Changsha: The fighting on the outskirts of Changsha is very fierce, with the two armies locked in a deadly struggle. The Japanese army has suffered heavy losses. Jiuling, Pingjiang, Yingtan, and Xiangyin are all still holding firm. The Chinese army on both sides of the Miluo River and the Laodao River is also very active, and the part that has infiltrated the suburbs of Changsha is now being individually besieged by the Chinese army. (Dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Hengyang: Japanese aircraft attacked Hengyang twice on the 29th. Once, five planes flew from Hubei to Hengyang to reconnoiter, and once, three planes flew from Guangdong to Hengyang, dropping bombs twice at 11:50 a.m. and then fleeing back to southern Guangdong, also dropping bombs in the county. (Dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<p>Inside Changsha City: No Japanese Flags</p>
<p>United Press Special Correspondent MacDougall reported: Today, I flew over Changsha on a Japanese plane for ten minutes. I saw that the city did not appear to have suffered any new damage, but it seemed to have become a ghost town. It seemed that neither the Chinese nor the Japanese army had recently damaged Changsha. I flew over Changsha with other reporters and a Japanese military spokesperson from Shanghai on a Japanese transport plane. I felt that Changsha was extremely desolate. There were only a few pedestrians on the streets. I counted five people. At an intersection of two major thoroughfares, there were hundreds of people gathered, seemingly driven together by the military. I saw an American flag flying over an oil depot and a building along the Xiang River. The words "U.S.A." were written in the courtyard of the building where the oil depot was located. (United Press editor's note: MacDougall's dispatch did not mention seeing any Japanese flags. Usually, the Japanese army hangs countless Japanese flags immediately after occupying a Chinese city.) In addition to the American flag, I also saw a French flag. I also flew over Zhuzhou, thirty-two miles south of Changsha, where the Japanese troops had withdrawn yesterday. I saw several places burning, caused by the bombs dropped when we flew from Yuezhou to Changsha. In Hankou, the American Consul General Mr. Spick told me that they had not received any news from them since the weekend. We saw Japanese bombers and fighters continuing to take off at the airport. (Dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Two Japanese Division Commanders Killed in Action</p>
<p>Chongqing: Reliable military sources claimed last night that the Japanese army is at least sixty kilometers north of Zhuzhou, the intersection of the Yuehan Railway and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and denied that the Japanese army had occupied Changsha. The source absolutely stated that the Japanese claim of occupying Zhuzhou is "as unfounded as the Japanese claim of having reached Changsha on Saturday." A Central News Agency report from the front lines of Northern Hunan stated that Kitano, commander of the Japanese 4th Division, was killed in action in the Suqiao war zone. His body was found by the forces of Chinese commander Li Yutang (the same person who participated in the Battle of Taierzhuang). The dispatch also stated that Toyoshima, commander of the Japanese 3rd Division, was also killed in action in the Huanggang war zone on Saturday. A Central News Agency report from the front lines of Northern Hunan also stated that the Chinese army wiped out a Japanese unit northwest of Changsha yesterday, capturing hundreds of warhorses. (United Press dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to unconfirmed Chinese sources, two Japanese division commanders have been killed in this campaign: Major General Kitano, commander of the 4th Division, and Major General Toyoshima, commander of the 3rd Division. Both died north of Changsha City. It is said that Kitano's body has been found by the Chinese army. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th)</p>
<p>Foreign Reporters Have Not Arrived</p>
<p>Changsha: Several foreign reporters from Shanghai who flew to Changsha on a Japanese military plane have been overdue for a long time. They have not arrived here for the past two days. Chinese authorities said that these famous reporters will receive a great welcome and will be allowed by the Chinese army to visit the entire city and its surroundings. It is claimed that rumors from the outside world that the city and its suburbs were occupied by the Japanese army last Saturday are false. The Chinese Army Headquarters issued a communiqué tonight stating that a "decisive battle" is currently taking place in the northern and northwestern suburbs of Changsha. The Chinese army's advantage is increasing with time. The Japanese army is now trapped in the Chinese army's encirclement. The Chinese commander is confident that the Japanese army will be completely annihilated within the next few days, and reiterated that Changsha is still firmly held by the Chinese army. (This telegram was sent from Changsha at 8:00 p.m. on September 29.) Note: The reporters from Shanghai to Changsha are O'Baugh, chief writer of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, Rickclara, United Press reporter, MacDougall, United Press reporter, two German reporters, and Akiyama, the Japanese military spokesperson. Their trip is scheduled for four days. (International News Service dispatch of the 29th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The Shanghai Students' General Association sent a telegram of respect to Chairman Chiang on the tenth anniversary of the September 18th Incident, stating: "Under your leadership, the nation's military and civilians have been engaged in resistance and construction. In the past four years, the Japanese army has been placed in an isolated and weak situation, and faces a deep crisis of collapse, while we have become stronger as we fight. Your great achievements are admired by both China and foreign countries. We students are far away on an isolated island and, although we are experiencing hardship, we dare not slacken in cultivating our character, studying hard, and implementing national policies. We respectfully send this telegram to you and extend our highest respect." (Telegram from the Shanghai Students' General Association on September 29)</p>

<p>Somewhere on the Front Lines: Li Zongren, Commander of the Fifth War Area and General of Guangxi, told a United Press reporter today, "Japan is very likely to attack the Soviet Union in the near future." Li explained his reasons, saying, "Now that Kiev has fallen and Leningrad is also in great danger, Japan will begin its attack when the German army is able to enter Moscow." General Li expressed his opinion on the American question, saying, "America's being drawn into the war is probably unavoidable. The question is only whether it will be in Europe or the Far East." "Now that two major powers are at war with Germany, the United States should fight Japan in order to protect its own interests. Then the world can once again achieve peace. The United States will take methods to deal with Japan." When asked about the Chinese counteroffensive, Li said, "The Fifth War Area is ready for a general counteroffensive whenever it receives such an order. At present, Chinese troops have secretly concentrated along the Japanese front lines. The Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Third War Areas have also launched offensives." Li's final conclusion was, "But I think the best opportunity is to launch a general counteroffensive against Japan after obtaining a large supply of American goods. Recently, we have received considerable training and improved our combat skills, and our morale is high. The general counteroffensive can be realized when the front-line commander gives the order."

<p>Chengdu: The buildings of Chongqing University were repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft in August, and most of the main buildings were destroyed. After the school's supervisory committee repeatedly telegraphed the provincial government to request funds for repairs, it has now been learned that the provincial government's 519th meeting today decided to allocate 100,000 yuan for repairs. Since Principal Liang arrived at the school to take office, he has worked extremely hard for more than a month to handle school affairs and all post-disaster matters. Recently, because his wife is ill at home, he urgently needs to leave Chongqing and return home to visit her. He repeatedly telegraphed the provincial government to resign. Chairman Zhang firmly retained him without success and intends to approve his request and inform the Ministry of Education by telegram. (Dispatch of the 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">The Three-Power Conference in Moscow <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The three-power conference of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which began in Moscow the day before yesterday, suddenly shattered the last line of illusions of the aggressive forces, who were simultaneously launching a fierce offensive on the Soviet Union's western front and exerting pressure on its eastern border, thus delaying the opening of the conference. The German army's capture of Kiev and the tension on the Japanese-Soviet border did not have any hindering effect. On the contrary, Britain and the United States immediately expressed a stronger stance, and the representatives quickly arrived in Moscow. This is something that the aggressors now have to deeply reflect upon! Strictly speaking, in terms of the standpoint, after the Anglo-Soviet alliance agreement, plus the United States repeatedly solemnly expressed its support for the Soviet Union, and the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting formally proposed to the Soviet Union to convene a three-power conference, then the current conference is an inevitable stage in the development of relations between them. In terms of material assistance, large quantities of British and American military equipment and raw materials were already being shipped, and there was no need to wait for the current Moscow conference. The reason why this Moscow conference has become an extremely important international event and is worthy of our attention is, first, that it demonstrates the sincerity and spirit of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, to thoroughly cooperate in defeating the aggressors. Second, it will give the future practical cooperation methods and scale between the three countries a completely new look.</p>
<p>From the aggressors' point of view, if their great enemy is always the total combination of all the righteous forces of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, then no matter what strategy they implement or what weapons they use, the result will always be the same failure. This is the common conclusion of all international observers today and has long become a general and simple common sense. And the only possibility for the aggressors to realize their dream of victory is to fantasize about defeating them one by one. This is also equally clear. But if we change direction and look at it from the perspective of the righteous front itself, the cooperative situation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union today is truly an unprecedented grand event! Such a move, which is worthy of the attention and cherishing of all mankind, first of all, shows that the weaknesses of various differences in countries, nations, and governments must be overcome by considerations for the overall progress of the world, and also proves that the future of mankind is ultimately moving towards brightness. Secondly, we can also say that without the vision, determination, and courage of the authorities of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, such a move would certainly not be possible. This again precisely illustrates the excellence of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin. Generally speaking, the door to individual compromise and appeasement between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union on the one hand and Germany, Italy, and Japan on the other hand has not been completely closed to this day. What is more difficult is that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, have been able to unanimously recognize today that, under the aggressors' tactics of defeating them one by one, they have absolutely no way to exist independently. This is one. What is even more difficult is that they have actually unanimously abandoned their attitudes over the years and their stubborn ideas about their future relations, and recognized that there is a full possibility and obligation to cooperate in transforming the world. This is two. Taking a further step forward and based on the advancement of all human civilization, they are even more concretely considering concrete plans for transforming the world. This is an even more rare phenomenon. This is three. And the leaders of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were able to resolutely move towards the goal after identifying the path. Such national leaders probably would not have been produced in any era before the twentieth century, so it constituted an unprecedentedly solemn and magnificent scene. This is four. Finally, there is one more point that we have to recognize and that is worth pointing out in particular, that is, among the three countries, apart from the fact that under the dictatorship of the Soviet Union, a part of the people's prejudices are not enough to constitute an obstacle to the actions of the authorities, Britain and the United States are both democratic countries. With the power of such a prejudiced group against the Soviet Union in Britain and the United States, Roosevelt and Churchill were able to implement their views, and probably no contemporary British or American politician other than these two could get such unconditional trust from the general public. These are all the points that one cannot help but think of when analyzing the current Moscow conference.</p>
<p>According to dispatches from Moscow, the scope involved in this three-power conference is not limited to material assistance to the Soviet Union. The main items to be discussed, most importantly, are the coordination of the entire strategy of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. From this, the general direction of their war operations in this year and 1942 will be decided. The second is the adjustment and exchange of military equipment, military supplies, and raw materials between the three countries. The third is the rapid supply of the war equipment currently needed by the Soviet Union, which is the most realistic and urgent. From the source of this conference, it came from the unanimous initiation and agreement of the highest authorities of the three countries, and the representatives of the three countries attending the conference this time almost included important figures in politics, economy, navy, army, air force, etc., so it is certain that they can bear the heavy responsibility of making major decisions and further practically implementing them. That is, of course, needless to say. In the current process of the conference, apart from the practical issues of equipment and resources, the three points that are probably hovering in the minds of people all over the world at this time are: (1) The way and timing of the Anglo-Soviet joint launch of a major counteroffensive against Germany and Italy. (2) The order of thoroughly resolving the two groups of violence in the East and the West. (3) The principles, methods, and timing of the United States' actual participation in the war. Looking at the current military situation, there is no doubt that the navies and air forces of Britain and the Soviet Union are in an overwhelming advantage. How the combined land forces compare to Germany and Italy is still difficult to accurately judge. But in any case, a counteroffensive against Germany and Italy is possible and necessary. What is lacking now is the issue of containing the situation in the East, which also involves the issue of the United States' actual participation in the war. After the successful conclusion of the Moscow conference in the future, we hope that a larger-scale conference of all the righteous forces in the international community can also be convened.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Jiang Ting Speaks to Foreign Reporters: The Chinese Army in Hubei is Determined to Hold Changsha; Welcomes British and American Financial Experts to China <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Jiang Ting made a speech at a reception for foreign reporters on the 29th, in which he discussed the battle in northern Hunan and other issues. The record of his speech is as follows: Mr. Jiang first declared to the foreign reporters in extremely firm terms that, regardless of how the Japanese side may publicize the current situation in the battle of northern Hunan, Changsha is still being defended by our army up to now. On Saturday night, a small number of Japanese troops in civilian clothes infiltrated the vicinity of Changsha, but they were soon completely repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese claim of occupying Changsha probably refers to this. The Chinese government and the generals at the front all have the determination to hold Changsha. The Japanese must pay the greatest price for every inch they advance. In addition, the Chinese troops attacking the Japanese rear have already reached their destination. The re-enactment of the history of the previous battle of northern Hunan is also within our expectations. Mr. Jiang continued, "At the same time as the Japanese invasion of Changsha, Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome held a joint Axis Alliance anniversary, and their self-congratulation was somewhat premature. However, there is no doubt that these three countries have the same view of the world situation and the determination to disrupt the world order. Japan and the Axis are in cahoots, and it is difficult to expect Japan to change. Therefore, any attempt to make Japan abandon the Axis is a misconception." Mr. Jiang then said, "We are preparing to welcome British and American economic delegations. Sir Niemeyer, the British representative, and Commissioner Clarence Meyer, the American representative, are both world-renowned economic experts with rich experience. Modern warfare often causes various unexpected economic problems, and there are many lessons left in European and American countries in this regard. The representatives sent by Britain and the United States this time have all participated in the consolidation work of the last World War, so their subsequent suggestions will be of great value." Mr. Jiang concluded, "I have a report that a major reform of our country's finances and the promotion of local autonomy will be carried out this year. The Executive Yuan is now preparing the next year's budget, which has reached the county government level. The county is an autonomous unit. In order to provide the necessary funding for the county government to promote autonomy, the Executive Yuan will increase its land tax revenue and the provincial government's subsidies to the county government."

<h3 id="e8">White Russians in Tianjin Unwilling to Receive Training <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin: White Russian residents in Tianjin have recently received two notices in succession from the White Russian Anti-Communist Committee, which is controlled by the Japanese, ordering several Russian residents to register at the so-called White House, the headquarters of the committee, to receive military training. The first notice listed the names of forty-six unmarried Russian men, and the second notice listed another forty, including some who were married. The Russian residents were very alarmed when they saw this and did not fully comply with the order. As a result, a White Russian named Herlansov was arrested by the White House because his son had not registered. At the same time, other protectors were also summoned to the White House and ordered to comply, otherwise they would suffer unspeakable consequences. However, Hersov, who is a hunchback, went on a hunger strike in the White House and refused to sign. After holding out for twenty-four hours, he was finally released. Herlansov told a Reuters reporter that he wanted to urge the Japanese authorities to pay attention to the illegality of detaining people in the White House, and declared that this kind of military training method was not approved by the Russian residents. At the same time, parents and draftees are making noise, wanting to know whether the initiator of this plan is the local authorities or the White House, but there has been no response so far, but a notice has been received stating that they can be summoned for training at any time and that employers should be notified in advance. It is found that most of the local Russian residents rely on the income of their sons' labor for a living. If they have to be dismissed for training, the livelihood of the Russian residents will be cut off. It is said that the White House claims that the opportunity to fight against communism is approaching, so preparations must be made in advance. (Reuters dispatch of the 28th) (Late arrival)</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to diplomatic sources, about thirty Japanese troops in Hanoi jumped into the Chinese Consulate General in Hanoi late on the night of the 25th, using ladders. They first tied up the workers and then broke down the doors and searched the inside. Two workers were arrested and items such as radios, typewriters, iron boxes, books, and newspapers were confiscated. Recently, Japanese troops in Vietnam have arbitrarily arrested about 100 Chinese overseas Chinese and Annamese people. Although about 60 have been released, there are still quite a few overseas Chinese who have been detained. After hearing the news, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately informed the embassy in France by telegram to lodge a protest with the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and asked the French Embassy here to telegram the Vietnamese government, asking Japan to immediately translate the detained overseas Chinese and return the confiscated property.

<p>Chongqing: The Commissioner of Police of Burma, Mr. Prescott, came to Chongqing mainly to discuss the issue of Chinese immigrants, which concluded successfully. He flew back to Rangoon last night. According to the Burmese side, their primary concern was whether a large number of Chinese would migrate after the full opening of the Yunnan-Burma transportation route. This point was thoroughly explained by the Chinese authorities and the representative in Burma, Zeng Rongfu, and Mr. Prescott also alleviated concerns based on his inspection results. Although the results of the negotiations with Rangoon have not been announced, according to what Mr. Prescott said before his departure, Chinese people traveling from Chongqing or Kunming to Burma will only need to have their identity certified by the local British consulate on their passports to enter the country. Other complicated procedures will be waived. Also, Mr. Prescott encountered two air raids during his stay in Chongqing and was able to inspect the air defense management firsthand, which he greatly admired. (Havass Agency, 30th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The Ministry of Economic Affairs is actively working on adjusting provincial trading organizations. In addition to the previously established principles for supervising trading operations, six principles for adjustment have been formulated and distributed by the Executive Yuan to various provinces for compliance: (1) Organizations engaged in trading operations but not structured as companies should adjust their operations and reorganize as companies. (2) Established companies whose operations include trade should adjust their operations in accordance with the supervisory principles. (3) Existing provincial trading companies should redefine their scope of business. (4) Provincial banks concurrently engaged in trade should cease their concurrent operations. (5) Matters of a regulatory nature handled by provincial trade agencies should be handled separately. (6) Provincial measures for managing the entry and exit of materials that hinder inter-provincial flow of goods should be abolished. It is reported that these measures have been quite effective since their implementation. The original provincial trading organizations in Guangxi and Jiangxi provinces have been formally reorganized as companies. Hunan, Suiyuan, and other provinces are in the process of reorganization. Fujian and Gansu provinces, which were originally company organizations, can complete the adjustment of their scope of business. It is said that other provinces are also actively working on it.

<p>Xue Fulang, editor of the Bangkok Chronicle, has recently arrived here. He claims that Thailand will emerge from the Far East's war of nerves without any losses. This optimism is based on the Thai government's strict adherence to a neutral policy, maintaining friendly relations with all major powers, and the preparedness of the Thai defense forces to resist any aggression. Current Anglo-Thai relations are extremely harmonious. Friendship can always be tested in times of adversity. Thailand values its friendship with Britain and will never adopt policies that would harm its relations with Britain and the United States.</p>

<h3 id="e19">US-Japan Negotiations Reach Delicate Stage; Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Hold Repeated Consultations; Chongqing Report Warns US Not to Fall for Japanese Deceit <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 30th: Japanese Foreign Minister Toyoda met with the Emperor last night and reported on matters discussed with US Ambassador to Japan Grew on Saturday and Sunday. It is believed that the frequent undisclosed consultations between Ambassador Grew and Foreign Minister Toyoda are extremely important. The postponement of British Ambassador to Japan Craigie's departure has not been explained today. Tokyo has not been able to determine whether this is related to the progress of US-Japan relations. Craigie was originally scheduled to leave Japan yesterday and travel to Britain and the United States via Shanghai for vacation, but suddenly canceled his trip. It is also learned that the consultations between Ambassador Grew and Foreign Minister Toyoda, and Foreign Minister Toyoda's meeting with the Emperor, are only a few of the many recent important meetings. Recently, Prime Minister Konoe has repeatedly consulted with his subordinates, such as Deputy Prime Minister Hiranuma, and the Emperor has also consulted with Finance Minister Ogura.</p>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 30th: The Central Daily News recently stated that for American diplomats to try to make Japan pay attention to American interests in China is like playing the lute to a cow. The newspaper stated that Japan's hope for peace is merely a delaying tactic, intended to gain a breathing space to prepare for its new offensive. Japan, currently facing economic and domestic difficulties, has no choice but to beg for American leniency. Therefore, this move by Japan is merely a cunning plan to avoid disaster, and there is no genuine sincerity in building peace in the Far East. In the past, Japan used anti-British and anti-American sentiments to gain Germany's favor and conclude the Tripartite Pact. Subsequently, it used the Tripartite Pact as a tool for negotiations with the United States and Britain, while also using explanations such as the Tripartite Pact being intended to prevent war to evade its obligations under the alliance. Today, Japan is again using the fact that it is feigning indifference to the Axis powers to seek compromise with the United States. All these actions are for one purpose: to divide the democratic countries and achieve its desire to conquer China at will. American diplomats should be aware of this.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th: When the Information Bureau spokesman Ishii received foreign reporters this morning, he was asked what impact the current war in China had on the discussions in Washington. Ishii replied that the large-scale war in China is currently proceeding in parallel with diplomatic efforts to resolve the China issue, but the latter is only indirect. Someone also asked whether the Japanese government agreed with the fact that the Tokyo newspapers were concerned about the activities of Sir Frederick Cooper in East Asia. Ishii replied that Sir Frederick Cooper was not secretive about his intentions, and the Japanese people were naturally paying attention to his activities. He continued to mention Sir Frederick Cooper's remarks, saying, "I quite admire his frankness."</p>

<p>Reuters, Singapore, 30th: Former Australian Trade Commissioner in Shanghai, Mr. Bowden, now serving as the first Australian Representative in Malaya, published an article here yesterday, stating that Singapore is the center of British and Allied defenses in the western Pacific and is extremely important to Australia.

<p>Tass, Moscow, 30th: The Soviet-American-British Three-Power Conference opened here yesterday. The heads of the Soviet, American, and British delegations, Molotov, Harriman, and Lord Beaverbrook, respectively, delivered speeches, solemnly expressing the unwavering determination of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain to fight against Hitler's Germany. The agenda of the conference was then adopted, and several committees were established to begin work immediately.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 30th: The Soviet-American-British Three-Power Conference met yesterday to discuss aid to the Soviet Union. The communique issued stated that the Moscow Three-Power Conference officially began this morning. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov chaired the meeting. Molotov praised the leaders of the British and American delegations, Lord Beaverbrook and Harriman. Six committees were then formed, including the Army, Air Force, Navy, Transportation, Raw Materials, and Medical Supplies committees, which immediately began work and will report on Soviet needs on Friday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 30th: The British Chief Representative, Beaverbrook, was unusually busy in the British Embassy yesterday morning as he prepared to attend the Three-Power Conference, giving the impression that this conference was of utmost importance, as the successful conduct of the war largely depends on this conference. On Sunday night, the leaders of the British and American delegations, along with the British and American ambassadors, met with Stalin for three hours and fifteen minutes. Molotov and Litvinov were also present, with Litvinov acting as interpreter. The exact scope of the Three-Power Conference has not been discussed, and the exact results of the conference may not be disclosed at any time. However, it is certain that the conference will discuss possible direct military assistance (as seen in the participation of the British Air Force in the Soviet front lines), short-term and long-term supplies, and the transport routes for these supplies. The above points, with transport routes being the most important and most difficult. The successful outcome of this conference is an extremely important factor for the Soviet morale. The British tank aid to the Soviet Union week has already created a good impression here. However, as Soviet Information Bureau Director Lozovsky said, the Soviet Union needs not just a week, but many weeks of war material supplies. The general view of the Soviet people is the same as Lozovsky's statement that the Soviet Union is adequately striking the entire German war machine. The Soviet newspapers even describe the United States as "the richest and most powerful country in the world."</p>
<p>General Voroshilov, Commander-in-Chief of the Leningrad Defense Forces, also participated in the meeting between the British and American Chief Representatives and Stalin. Beaverbrook assured during the meeting that the British people were prepared to make great sacrifices to help overcome the common enemy. Harriman also assured the Soviet Union that the fullest possible assistance would be given until the final victory in the war was achieved. Beaverbrook and Harriman held a second meeting with Stalin, which lasted for about three hours.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 30th: At today's meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Churchill made a thirty-seven-minute statement on the war situation, stating that the British and American representatives attending the Moscow Three-Power Conference had clear and sufficient knowledge of the assistance we could give to the Soviet Union month by month thereafter. I must immediately declare that in order for the Soviet Union to remain on the battlefield as a first-class combatant nation, the British people must make extremely serious sacrifices and the greatest efforts. The United States must also build vast new factories or transform existing factories. Churchill announced that the future Anglo-Soviet and Persian New Alliance would enable the Persians to cooperate with us in future war efforts. Churchill further warned the British people that the winter could not guarantee that the Germans would ease their oppression, and we must expect an unprecedentedly fierce battle on the Eastern Front next spring, and the threat of invading the three British islands would also present an extremely sharp form. When Churchill mentioned the bravery of the Soviet troops in combat and the indomitable spirit of the Chinese people, the entire House cheered for a long time before stopping. Churchill expressed surprise at Hitler's failure to realize his boasted submarine offensive, and announced that the losses of British Allied and neutral merchant ships in July, August, and September were only one-third of the losses in April, May, and June, while the number of German and Italian ships sunk by us during the same period increased greatly, with the number in the latter three months increasing by one and a half times compared to the former. Very few important ships transporting war materials for the Allied forces were lost.</p>

<p>United Press, Tehran, 30th: Following important military conferences held here and in Baghdad, the enhanced close cooperation between British and Soviet troops in the Middle East and India to deter the German threat to the Caucasus was evident yesterday. General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, met with senior military officials from Iran and the Soviet Union yesterday, but declined to comment. It is rumored that Britain is preparing to send expeditionary forces to help the Soviet Union defend the Caucasus front. He said, "Such rumors are often inaccurate." General Wavell solemnly stated that Britain intends to fully cooperate with the Soviet Union in this region. However, when asked about unified command, he replied, "I don't see the need for that."</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 30th: Agriculture Department Eastern European expert Volin said in a report released by the department that the United States may ship grain to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok and Iran, as the Soviet Union's food supply is now quite serious since Ukraine was occupied by the Nazis. According to Volin, the grain in western Siberia that was previously transported to the Far East and Turkestan can now supply the European part of the Soviet Union, while the Far East and Turkestan can be supplied by the United States. He also said that if the Nazis occupy Moscow and Leningrad, the food problem will be alleviated, as the aforementioned two regions usually require large quantities of grain to be transported from other regions. Volin concluded by saying that as a result of the Soviet scorched earth policy, the Germans' ability to hope for grain from Ukraine is indeed very slim.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 30th: President Roosevelt may return to Washington from his Hyde Park residence today to discuss with Secretary of State Hull the best way to arm merchant ships, as the arming of merchant ships is prohibited by the Neutrality Act. Congressional leaders will also discuss this issue on Wednesday. Currently, there is no concrete indication from the authorities that they intend to repeal the Neutrality Act immediately. However, there is an implication that it is easier to succeed with a partial revision than with a complete repeal. This may be a major factor in determining the course of action of the authorities. According to the law, ships cannot be armed, and they are also prohibited from sailing into war zones.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 30th: Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday afternoon that he favored amending the Neutrality Act rather than repealing it. Reporters first asked whether the authorities wanted to repeal the Neutrality Act or only delete some of its provisions. Hull replied that last week he had stated that the time was ripe to repeal the restrictions imposed by the Neutrality Act. He favored amending it, but this was a matter that had to be discussed at a meeting with people in Congress.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 30th – According to news received here today, there are no signs of progress for German forces on any part of the vast Soviet front. General Timoshenko's troops in the central district are now capitalizing on their major victory in the Smolensk area with a vigorous counter-offensive. The tank and motorized divisions commanded by German blitzkrieg strategist General Guderian have been routed by Soviet forces at Bryansk, 150 miles southeast of Smolensk, and are currently in retreat. Guderian's plan was originally to seize Roslavl (70 miles southeast of Smolensk) and attempt a breakthrough towards Moscow, while the German right wing would encircle southeast and capture Kursk, 300 miles southwest of Moscow. However, General Timoshenko's counter-offensive was launched first, inflicting a severe blow on the German forces. Soviet military officers estimate that the German losses are around 20,000 men. Regarding the situation in the Leningrad area, Moscow claims that tank battles have been ongoing for seven consecutive days. One Soviet tank unit reportedly destroyed twelve enemy tanks and rendered enemy long-range artillery positions and other important equipment ineffective. In Crimea, a land and air blitzkrieg is expected, but there is currently no new information to report.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Moscow, 30th – The Red Army High Command reported this morning that the Soviet tank offensive near Leningrad is progressing well, estimating that 2,500 German soldiers have been eliminated. The Soviet forces also destroyed 36 German tanks and numerous artillery units. It was also stated that in the past two days, Soviet forces have shot down 263 German aircraft on the front lines. Meanwhile, it is reported that the Soviet counter-offensive is gradually strengthening, and fierce battles are ongoing along the entire front. The Red Army High Command further stated that the war situation in Leningrad and Odessa is currently favorable to the Soviet forces. The vanguard of Marshal Timoshenko's central army is now approaching Gomel and Smolensk.</p>

<p>International News Agency, Berlin, 30th – A spokesman for the German General Staff said that the German army will be fully prepared for a major offensive next spring, adding that during the last war, the German army spent several winters on Soviet territory.

<p>International News Agency, Berlin, 30th – Just as the High Command announced that the German army had eliminated three more Soviet divisions in Ukraine, German newspapers today unanimously predicted that the arrival of winter will soon halt the progress of the war against the Soviet Union. Hitler's personal obituary declared that the cessation of hostilities for several months in winter is "undoubted," but continued that Germany will be stronger than the Soviet Union in the spring. Meanwhile, a communiqué reported that the German air force is constantly attacking Soviet positions in the Donets River basin, where German forces are advancing towards Kharkiv.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 30th – Although there was light snow in Moscow on Sunday, it was welcomed by all. It is believed that snow has also fallen in northwestern Russia, making operations extremely difficult for the German army. Officials stated that there were fierce battles between the Red Army and the German army yesterday. The information did not elaborate on the progress of the war, only stating that there were fierce battles along the entire front all day. As the temperature gradually rose towards morning, the snow in Moscow melted, but the snow is a harbinger of the severe cold climate that has prevailed in the Soviet Union in past years, followed by wind and rain, in support of the coldest September in years. Soviet troops in the northwest are stationed in deep and comfortable basements, but the German troops in the Navina West District are said to be exposed to the severe cold of rain, mud, and ice. News from the front lines stated that in the recent counter-offensive, after defeating General Böttcher's armored column, the Red Army has recaptured two towns southwest of Bryansk. This armored column of the 12th Division was reportedly repelled west of Bryansk the previous night and abandoned a large number of tanks. The Red Army has not yet continued to pursue the officially fleeing German forces.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 30th – Reuters military commentator stated that the Eastern Front war has now lasted one hundred days. The Soviet side says that fierce fighting is ongoing along the entire front, while the German side claims victory northeast of Dnipropetrovsk, with Italian forces also contributing to the battle. However, the scale of the battle there does not seem to be huge. It is now increasingly clear that the Soviet-German war has become a war of attrition. Both sides have achieved local victories, but may not be able to achieve a decisive victory before the arrival of winter brings all military activities to a temporary halt.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Charity Basketball Tournament for Student Aid Rescheduled for This Saturday; All Arrangements Remain Unchanged <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The first match of the Shanghai Star vs. Paramount charity basketball tournament for student aid, organized by the Paramount Athletic Association, was originally scheduled to take place this afternoon. Preparations had been completed. However, the court surface was eroded by the previous day's autumn rain, exposing bricks and creating uneven surfaces. Although laborers were hired to compact it, it could not be completed in time. The organizers specifically had the entire surface rebuilt and, with the agreement of the Shanghai Star team, rescheduled the opening match for this Saturday (October 4). All arrangements, as well as the dates of the second and third matches, remain unchanged. Presale tickets are still being sold at the Paramount, and more time is being used for promotional activities in order to increase the amount of charitable funds raised.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Support from All Sides: China United Football <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Tang Genfu of the Mighty Lions Football Club stated yesterday that he admired Mr. Wang Ruilong, chairman of the Ruilong Athletic Association, for taking the lead in organizing the Chinese Football League. Since the Yiyuan incident this spring, all patriotic Chinese citizens should seek alternative solutions. This year, the Chinese teams have withdrawn from the Western League. Therefore, there is a need to quickly form a Chinese Football League. Now that Mr. Wang has taken the lead, I and the Mighty Lions Football Club have decided to promote this matter and provide enthusiastic cooperation. We would like to offer our humble opinions on the arrangements, hoping that senior figures in the sports community will come forward to provide guidance and corrections to ensure smooth progress. (1) We strongly support Mr. Wang's proposal that each participating team send representatives to participate in the administrative committee to handle affairs. (2) The issue of venues should be resolved as soon as possible. Seeking empty space for construction may not be possible in the short term. It would be best to borrow the East China Association's field, the Zhen Dan soccer fundraising fund.</p>
<p>A letter from Zhu Zhe stated: "Having read in your newspaper that Mr. Wang Ruilong, chairman of the Ruilong Athletic Association, is organizing a Chinese Football League, I am overjoyed as a football fan. Mr. Wang's idea of owning a field and adopting a joint-stock company structure to issue shares is excellent. However, the purpose of the league, as Mr. Wang said, is entirely for sports, unlike today's businesses that prioritize speculation for profit. Raising capital may not be easy. In my opinion, if the share offering is insufficient, the authorities can publicly presell long-term admission tickets, that is, pay a certain amount of money at once to enjoy all the league matches or two seasons. For example, if last year's Yiyuan ticket price was one yuan and ten cents, watching fourteen matches (with eight teams participating in a double round-robin) would cost fifteen yuan and forty cents. Then, each person could pay fifteen yuan and forty cents at once to watch fourteen league matches, or pay thirty yuan and eighty cents to watch two years. This would save spectators the trouble of buying tickets for each match, and the authorities could raise funds in advance, which is a win-win situation. According to the Mainland News, 'The withdrawal of Chinese teams from the Western League this year will result in a loss of more than 200,000 yuan in ticket revenue.' This 200,000 yuan plus can be easily transferred to the Chinese League. Given the fervent patriotism of the Chinese people, they will certainly be eager to subscribe, and may even exceed this amount. The resentment of Chinese teams being suppressed by the Western League every year can be expressed with Mr. Wang's call to action. We wish him success." Signed, Li Shuyuan, September 29.</p>

<h3 id="e41">After Yarn Prices Rise Continuously by Hundreds of Yuan, Shuang Ma Yarn Suddenly Reverses; Futures Market Greatly Disturbed by Factory Orders; Nanyang Ports Continue to Handle Shipments <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>After rising continuously for four days, yarn and cloth prices fell yesterday after opening high. This was because Shuang Ma factory orders had risen by about 100 yuan in recent days, prompting some profit-takers to sell. At the same time, the securities and gold industries were still fighting on the short side, so the market loosened and prices fell. In fact, this kind of phenomenon is a normal reaction in the market. However, yarn sales in Hong Kong are not as prosperous as they were on the previous day, and have turned sluggish. This is because the amount of purchases made over several days has been quite high. A ship has already sailed to Nanyang yesterday, and will temporarily wait for telegrams to be forwarded before collecting more goods. Moreover, 800 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped directly to Hong Kong today. In this way, the shorts, who have been threatened for several days, are active again and take the opportunity to dump their holdings, which naturally affects the market. Another saying is that a sea vessel was blocked outside Wusongkou, so more floating orders were released. The shorts took advantage of the situation to pursue the decline. The high price of 20-count Shuang Ma was 1,849 yuan, and the low price was 1,815 yuan. The afternoon opening price was flat at 1,815 yuan, and gradually rose to 1,832 yuan. Then, it was heard that the yarn market at the exchange had fallen, and it fell to 1,816 yuan. The closing price was 1,823 yuan. The current general opinion in the yarn market is that, except for being banned, it cannot be relaxed, and whether the market price continues to rise depends on sales.</p>
<p>Shuang Ma opened in the morning, continuing the enthusiasm of the afternoon of the previous day, with the opening price at 1,845 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,849 yuan, and hovered between 44 and 45 yuan for a while. Then, the exchange opened near the jump, shooting the distant months to fatigue, and people's minds turned loose. Moreover, the Guis on the table unanimously robbed space to take the hat, and in a flash it fell to 1,818 yuan. However, as the market price was tired, the picking and replenishment rose together, and immediately returned to 1,831 yuan. However, rumors are still strong, saying that a certain ship in Wusongkou was blocked, and morale fell again, falling to 1,815 yuan at the close. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics were 15,070 packages. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same business 15,000 Nanyang 70</p>
<p>Statistics 15,070</p>

<p>The current cotton situation is sluggish and fatigued with the yarn market, and transactions are not as excited as the previous day, but those who hold goods, listening to the price is about to loosen, would rather put them aside and not sell, but the arrogance has faded a step, this is because of the improvement in the Xiangbei war situation, those who want to buy can not but slightly take care of themselves,</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market, first fell due to speculators selling and cotton merchants hedging, but then rose again due to short covering and Calcutta textile industry buying, as a result yesterday's closing price, each rose about six or seven yuan Robbi, and predict today's opening market outlook to rise two Robbi,</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the central and HSBC listed rates unchanged. HSBC's small counter rate was also flat.

Chinese merchants engaged in both long and short positions with banks, with long positions adding .03125 to the closing price and short positions subtracting .03125 to cover. Some sold to banks for $4.75 and covered their short positions for $4.625. Long and short positions that did not want to settle had to pay a US$.03125 fee to transfer to importers with unclear applications. Some obtained settlements from speculative bulls, but had to pay an additional service fee of US$1.25 or more to foreign banks before transferring it to foreign exporters. Market prices remained approximately at 2 shillings and 8.125 pence for British currency and $4.625 for US dollars, returning to the previous day's price. It was rumored that Deutsche Bank again imported US$450,000 in notes at a price of $22.40, bringing the total imported this month to US$230,000.</p>

<p>Extending Acceptance of Notes from Four Foreign Banks</p>
<p>The Bank Reserve Association has decided to extend the acceptance of notes from four foreign banks starting today. The committee sent a circular to all banks yesterday stating that to facilitate the exchange of funds from foreign banks, the association has opened accounts with Citibank and Chase Bank. It is stipulated that starting from October 1st, any notes from HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase Bank that cannot be sent to the association within the stipulated time, can still be deposited with the association before 2:00 PM every Monday to Friday and before 11:00 AM on Saturdays. To simplify the procedures, it is also stipulated that starting from October 1st of this year, when member banks of the association deposit payment notes from foreign banks with the association for collection, in addition to recording the deposit slip number according to the association's Note No. 179 circular, there is no need to submit a list.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Food Unreasonable Rice Price Surge <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Although the rumors about foreign rice subsided yesterday, the aftermath persisted, and a more violent surge in prices began. As a result, prices for all types of rice increased by $3 to $4, fueled by new major hoarders inside and outside the industry who were still stirring up trouble, engaging in both aggressive buying and holding goods to inflate prices. The situation suddenly became chaotic, followed by smaller speculative accounts joining in, adding fuel to the fire and further agitating the market. As the price of small-grain rice became more active, it soared all the way up. Other types of rice, such as No. 1 Saigon and No. 2 Siam, also became highly sought after, with prices rising uniformly during active trading. In fact, rice merchants were constantly looking to cause trouble. The Yinghua Company's small-grain rice opened at $140 and was still being bid higher, while Liji's small-grain rice also opened at $134, a jump of $2, $3, or $4 compared to the previous market. However, rumors of peace suddenly emerged in the afternoon, greatly shocking the long positions. Selling pressure suddenly intensified, and the market experienced a sharp drop of $2 or $3, especially for small-grain rice. Before the evening close, it only opened at $115, and all other types of rice retreated slightly. The trading volume was over 35,000 tons. Although the result was a slight increase compared to the northern market, the future market was viewed with bearish sentiment.</p>
<p>The situation for new and broken japonica rice was the opposite yesterday, with broken rice rising and new rice falling. This was because the supply of broken japonica rice was decreasing as it was about to be phased out, while sales were relatively brisk, leading to an uneven distribution between arrivals and sales. Therefore, the owners were more reluctant to sell, and prices increased by $1 or $2. South Port early broken rice opened at $147, then fell to $144 or $145. Wuxi broken japonica rice was at $150. New japonica rice, on the other hand, was mainly from the new Xixin harvest, and the supply increased daily thereafter. Yesterday, no less than 200 loads arrived, but the road was not widely used due to the soft texture. This was in contrast to the broken rice monopoly, and the market was still difficult to establish, falling by $2 or $3. Ordinary new Kunshan japonica rice opened at $147, while special types were scarce and still opened at $151 or $150.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also remained strong due to the continued fluctuations in foreign rice, but prices were difficult to raise further as they had been surging for several days. Therefore, the situation was one of actual stability with hidden increases, and the quality varied greatly, with a difference of up to $2 depending on the type of rice. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at $140, then yellow glutinous rice at $135, glutinous rice at $126 to $124.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market fluctuated, but ultimately showed weakness. Early in the morning, the market continued the previous day's upward trend, and retail sales remained active. Speculators were particularly active due to rising rice prices. Battery flour rose to $35.35, Fushou to $35, Red and White to $34.70, Golden Dragon West Station to $33.45, and East Station to $34.10. However, in the afternoon, the market suddenly plunged by 5, 7, or 8 cents due to unfavorable peace rumors and continued arrivals of orders. Holders, fearing that the Mid-Autumn Festival demand had passed and that buyers would not continue, also sold into the market. Golden Dragon West Station once fell to $33.70, closing at $32.85. Battery flour was at $34.70, a decline of 3 or 4 cents from the previous day. The trading volume was 20,000 to 30,000 bags. Both arrivals and sales of wheat were quiet, and sellers were determined to hold their ground.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the opening price of edible oil futures was raised by about $2 due to the continued relentless buying by rice merchants. However, actual sales were sluggish. The news of Dalian oil arriving in Shanghai was confirmed, and there was a large accumulation of inventory in the factory, prompting those holding inventory to rush to release their goods, causing market sentiment to weaken. The market ultimately failed to hold its ground and trended lower, resulting in a decline of about half a dollar from the previous day. Raw soybean oil was both flat and soft. The unified market opened with 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 10 barrels of soybean oil, 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, and 20 barrels of Yanqui soybean oil. There were over 8,000 dan of Qing oil futures from the Dayou Factory and 2,000 barrels of rapeseed oil futures from the Rihua Factory.</p>

<p>Gray market for public bonds: Yesterday, the market continued to strengthen. The Tongkang and No. 31 Sichuan banks showed no selling interest and remained firm. However, due to unresolved rumors, the increase seemed weak. At the opening yesterday morning, Class C bonds immediately rose by more than 4 cents. Yongchang continued to buy, Tongkang sold slightly, and Jiufeng and Tongshun sold slightly. The market turned lower because the opening price was too high, creating an unnatural state. Although Lianhe and Runli bought in, Xiexingyuan also sold a lot, so the noon close was only 5 cents. In the afternoon, Yongchang continued to buy in, and Xinfu also had demand. Shuntai, Dingkang, Yichang, and Runde also bought in. Both types once reached 1 yuan and 9 cents, arousing the enthusiasm of buyers. Lianhe switched to selling, Xiexingyuan continued to sell, and Yitai, Hongda, Yongkang, Zhongfu, and others also sold, causing the market price to retreat by 3 cents. As a result, the overall market continued to improve by 2 cents to 2.5 cents. The total trading volume was about 2.5 million to 2.6 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Lihua Company were traded at a price of $170 each.</p>
<p>Zhongye Public Exchange: The stock market remained in a sideways trend throughout the day, with no new developments. Rubber stocks slightly rebounded, and low-priced stocks were particularly popular. Liphay stocks rose by as much as 2 cents in a matter of minutes, and other stocks also increased at varying rates. The closing trend was stable.</p>
<p>London, 29th (Monday) Telegram: Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debt and British companies with interests in the East still saw only bank stocks show activity. Mercantile Bank shares fell by 1 shilling and 3 pence to £9 5s (£9.9375 as published in last week's "Five Codes" telegram, which is probably a mistake for £9 3s 1.25d). HSBC UK-registered shares rose by half a pound to £77.50. Oriental Bank shares also rose by 15 shillings to £10. The rest remained unchanged.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday, and actual sales continued. Factory roots remained tight. Yihua Factory opened at $66.50 for 16-pound Wufu coarse cloth for immediate delivery. Tongyi Factory opened at $66.50 for 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth for next month's delivery, totaling over 300 pieces. The market was flat for coarse, fine, twill, and plain cloths.

<h3 id="e53">Facts Obtained in This City Prove Chinese Troops Still Holding Changsha Decisive Battle Currently Unfolding Chinese Advantage Japanese Sources Admit They Did Not Capture Zhuzhou <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Japanese sources claim that they entered Changsha at 6:30 PM on the 27th. The commander of the Chinese 9th War Zone, Xue Yue, went to Hengyang on the 26th, and then reportedly went to Changde. It was also claimed that a portion of the Japanese army had crossed Changsha and was pursuing south, reaching Zhuzhou on the 29th. However, these claims have been resolutely denied by the Chinese military authorities, who stated that Xue is currently in Changsha overseeing operations. The fact that Xue used a long-distance telephone from Changsha on the 29th to report the situation on the front lines to the Chinese Supreme Command in Chongqing, stating that the Japanese army was surrounded by Chinese troops northeast of Changsha and would soon be wiped out, proves that the Japanese propaganda is completely inaccurate.</p>
<p>Western Reporters Invited to Fly to Hunan</p>
<p>However, in order to exaggerate the Japanese army's victories in northern Hunan, Lieutenant Colonel Akimizu of the "Japan Dispatch Vehicle Reporting Department" invited O'Poole, chief writer of the English-language "Great American Evening News" in this city and correspondent for the "Christian Science Monitor," Li, a reporter from the Associated Press, MacGowan, a reporter from the United Press, and two German reporters to depart from Shanghai by plane on the 19th. Although the stated destination was Changsha, the planned itinerary was to go from Hankou to Yuezhou on the 30th, inspect the Changsha area "occupied" by the Japanese army by plane on the afternoon of the 30th, and return to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 1st. It was not stated whether they would land in Changsha.</p>
<p>People in Changsha Have Been Waiting for a Long Time</p>
<p>As confirmed by a cable from the International News Service from Changsha received on the 29th and published on the front page of the English-language "Great American Evening News" yesterday, the Chinese military authorities in Changsha are indeed very welcome to Western reporters. Unfortunately, the Japanese plane may not land there. According to the cable from the International News Service: "People in Changsha have been waiting for the foreign news reporters from Shanghai to arrive on a Japanese military plane for the past two days (28th and 29th). However, they have not arrived. The Chinese authorities here state that they warmly welcome these famous news reporters and will grant them special permission to tour the entire city and suburbs with the Chinese army."</p>
<p>Japanese Army Encircled</p>
<p>It is said that since last Saturday, rumors have been circulating that Changsha and its surrounding areas have been captured by the Japanese army. Last night, the Chinese military headquarters announced that a decisive battle is currently underway in the northern outskirts of Changsha, with the Chinese army holding a more advantageous position. It is claimed that the Japanese army has fallen into the encirclement laid by the Chinese army, and the Chinese commander expects the Japanese army to retreat within days. Pu Jian claimed that the Chinese army is still firmly holding Changsha.</p>
<p>Facts Prove Zhuzhou Not Captured</p>
<p>Regarding the situation in Changsha, based on the reports released by both the Chinese and Japanese sides, the Chinese side has clearly stated that Changsha is still being firmly defended, while the Japanese side has not only claimed that Changsha has been occupied, but also that Zhuzhou, the central point of Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, has been captured. Considering the past situation, the Chinese army has never concealed any area that has been lost. Now that the Chinese side has denied the loss of Changsha with a firm tone, while the Japanese side is still making propaganda of continuous victories, all parties feel deeply strange. However, what is gradually being proven is that according to Japanese newspaper reports, the Japanese Central China Army Headquarters announced the previous night that it had withdrawn from Zhuzhou due to the completion of its mission. This statement of withdrawal by the Japanese side is consistent with the Chinese military authorities' claim that Zhuzhou has not been lost. However, the Japanese army's claim that it withdrew after completing its mission is puzzling. According to observers here, Zhuzhou is an important transportation hub in Hunan Province, and even the Japanese side recognizes it as a key point for military and economic control in Hunan Province. Now that the Japanese side has occupied it, why would it lightly abandon it? Is it not a miracle in military history? Moreover, if the Japanese army occupied Zhuzhou, it could serve as a shield for Changsha, and there would be no reason to abandon it strategically.</p>
<p>Japanese Transportation Has Been Cut Off</p>
<p>According to another report in Japanese newspapers, Chinese reinforcements were still pouring in because they were unaware that Changsha had fallen, and were ambushed by the Japanese army north of Changsha. The Japanese claimed that the Japanese army had entered from the east of Changsha, so the Chinese army's retreat route would be problematic. How could they advance north? Therefore, the claim that they have occupied Changsha is difficult to believe. In addition, the Japanese side also admitted that there were fierce battles in Pingjiang, northeast of Changsha, and Dayun Mountain in northern Hunan. Japanese planes also heavily bombed the Chinese army in Dayun Mountain. All of these situations are completely consistent with the Chinese claim that the Japanese army's transportation in northern Hunan has been cut off, and the Chinese army is launching a large encirclement against the Japanese army attacking Changsha, which can be defeated without attacking.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Benefiting Ordinary People Second Phase of Public Warehouse Rice Sold at a Flat Price Limited to $110 per Stone Sales Start on the 11th of This Month <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The Food Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee purchased a second batch of Yangon small-grain rice totaling over 58,000 bags, which arrived and were unloaded at the warehouse some time ago. In order to discuss the flat-price sales, the committee held a subcommittee meeting the day before yesterday afternoon. All members attended the meeting on time. However, because all the motions were not sorted out in time, the announcement was delayed until yesterday. The committee decided to adhere to its original intention and continue to entrust the sale of the rice stored in Shanghai to rice shops at a flat price of $110 per stone (160 market catties), starting from October 11th. The various measures are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Flat-Price Sales Measures</p>
<p>(1) The fixed price for each bag sold to the rice shops (weighing 214 pounds including the bag) is $133.75, equivalent to $107 per stone. The rice shops will sell it to consumers at a price not exceeding $110 per stone (160 market catties net). (2) All members of the Shanghai Rice Shops Industry Association have the right to purchase warehouse rice. Rice shops can purchase warehouse rice in three units of 140 bags, 50 bags, and 25 bags. (3) It is stipulated that the payment time for rice shops is from 9:00 AM on October 7th to 5:00 PM on October 15th, collected by the Fuyuan Money Shop at 70 Ningbo Road (only head slips will be accepted, banknotes will not be accepted).</p>
<p>Sales Date</p>
<p>(4) The rice distribution time is from 8:00 AM on October 8th to 8:00 PM on October 20th. All rice shops will start door-to-door sales from 9:00 AM on October 11th. (5) A separate set of rules for the low-priced sale of the first batch of warehouse rice will be issued to each rice shop for compliance. (6) The purpose of this low-priced sale of warehouse rice is to benefit ordinary people, so the sale of rice will focus on supplying ordinary consumers. The maximum purchase per household is limited to one stone, in order to achieve widespread distribution. It is understood that the Shanghai Rice Shops Industry Association is already drafting a notice to inform all members to actively purchase at that time, in order to achieve widespread distribution of low-priced warehouse rice.</p>
<p>First Phase Sold Out</p>
<p>In the past, in order to stabilize the rice market and relieve ordinary people, the committee entrusted the Shanghai Rice Shops Industry Association to resell a total of 400 tons (i.e., 4,000 bags) of No. 1 Siam rice to 46 members of the association. The price was $113 in national currency per stone (160 market catties including the bag). All rice shops that sold the rice started door-to-door sales on August 23rd at a flat price of $116 per stone, greatly benefiting ordinary people. The warehouse rice has now been sold out by the rice shops, and detailed records have been kept for the public warehouse committee to check at any time.</p>

<p>The "North China Daily News" published a letter from Lauchlin Currie from Chongqing on September 19th stating that he had recently received a clipping from the August 24th "North China Daily News" entitled "Lauchlin Currie and the CCP," which contained statements such as "I am President Roosevelt's personal representative." He wrote, "Since my arrival in China, many absurd rumors have been spread about me. The source of these rumors is obvious and is intended to create distrust between the American and Chinese people, and to cause discord between American and British public opinion. I am making a brief statement to clarify the situation. First, I am not President Roosevelt's personal representative, but I am completely under the orders of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and am serving him sincerely. Second, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek asked President Roosevelt to recommend an American to serve as his personal government advisor, and President Roosevelt granted his request. The entire process has great significance for all democratic countries resisting aggression. When one democratic country assists another, the focus is on assistance and never on interference or control. The entire meaning of my coming to China lies in this. In this regard, my work is no different from the work of other American and British people serving or cooperating with the Chinese government. Cooperation between democratic countries is different from imperialist aggression. The Japanese are well aware of this difference. The method of democratic countries is to provide China with the assistance it requests to the greatest possible extent. Assisting China is also assisting one's own country and all people who love freedom. The important lessons of the past four years have made the United States and Britain even more dependent on China's defense of justice and freedom. I serve the great leader of China, and I know that I am also serving the goals of my own country and the world."</p>

<p>The French Concession Board of Directors announced yesterday that it would return to the old time today, setting the clock back one hour at midnight yesterday. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement has not yet decided when to abolish daylight saving time, although it is rumored to be from the 11th of this month. Therefore, the two concessions are not consistent.</p>
<p>The "Times" reported that, according to United Press, Hong Kong time will be set back half an hour from 3:30 AM on October 1st. This will cause inconvenience to Shanghai and Hong Kong stock and banking businesses. With Shanghai still using summer time, Shanghai time will be half an hour earlier than Hong Kong. If the clock is turned back one hour in the future to implement winter time, Shanghai time will be half an hour earlier than Hong Kong again. In both cases, the opening and closing times of the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock markets and banks will be different, causing inconvenience for telegraphic communications. Yesterday, authorities at the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that the issue of returning to winter time was still under consideration, and no indication was given as to when summer time would be abolished and the clock set back.</p>

<p>Regarding the promotion of the common economic and financial interests of China, Britain, and the United States through domestic and foreign capital management, this is a crucial aspect of the ABC alliance, aimed at fostering the economic interdependence of the three nations.

<p>Bank of England</p>
<p>Governor Montagu Norman (i.e., Niemeyer), along with U.S. Commissioner Currie, are coming to China to assist in resolving China's wartime financial and monetary problems, which is naturally significant. Yesterday, Hong Kong Telecom reported that after Norman and Currie arrive in Hong Kong, they will hold meetings with Chinese officials to determine the amount of new loans from Britain and the United States to China, thereby ensuring the stability of China's legal currency. This demonstrates that the economic ties among China, Britain, and the United States are increasingly strengthening. This move will help further strengthen China's war efforts in preparation for achieving ultimate victory. Furthermore, according to a newspaper report, President Roosevelt's Far East</p>

<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reports that two seamen of the American postal ship President Pierce, Tomsky and Reinhardt, were returning to the President Pierce by small boat last night (the 29th) at 7:00 PM. Already intoxicated, they accidentally fell into the Huangpu River. Reinhardt was quickly rescued, but Tomsky is feared to have drowned. Despite searching all night, his body has not been recovered as of this morning (the 30th).

<p>Since the American Clipper aircraft, departing from Hong Kong, connects to the route via Manila, Honolulu, San Francisco, Vietnam, the Atlantic Ocean, and Lisbon in Portugal, airmail from Shanghai to Europe has been extremely convenient. The entire journey takes only 14 days. If transported by British Overseas Airways, it can only fly from Singapore to the southeastern region of Africa.</p>
<p>Departing from Shanghai</p>
<p>The transportation by ship to Singapore takes more time, making it less efficient than using Pan American aircraft. According to information obtained from the transportation sector, Pan American aircraft will open a new route, connecting from Hong Kong to New York, flying to the Middle East and Africa. The route will extend from New York through Vietnam and Central America, passing through San Juan and other locations, to Puerto Rico. It will then pass through Port of Spain in Trinidad to Brazil, continuing for another 1,800 kilometers from Newfoundland to Ireland, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, entering Africa through Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria, and connecting to Cairo in the Middle East, with a total distance of 6,000 kilometers. This new air route has been approved by the U.S. authorities and will be</p>
<p>Implemented Soon</p>
<p>In the future, airmail from Shanghai to various parts of Africa can be transported by both British Overseas Airways and Pan American Airways. British and American aircraft will fly side by side to various parts of the Middle East. In terms of speed, if the new route is extended to Hong Kong, it will be even faster. Currently, Pan American aircraft already depart from Hong Kong, flying to the United States and Europe. Furthermore, it is learned that the China National Aviation Corporation</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Guilin Route</p>
<p>Originally scheduled to operate once a week, flying directly from Hong Kong to Guilin, was implemented in mid-September. However, according to news from Hong Kong, the flight schedule has been changed to irregular, depending on the number of passengers. It is also learned that the much-publicized Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Hong Kong-Shaoguan new route, which had been in preparation for a long time, was originally scheduled to commence in early October, but the commencement date is uncertain because the radio equipment has not yet been installed and procedures are still pending.</p>
<h3 id="e61">September Cost of Living Index Rises Sharply; Purchasing Power of Legal Tender Decreases Again <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Although rice prices fell in September, the cost of living index for workers rose sharply. Since the announcement of the foreign exchange freeze at the end of July, the trend of rising prices has continued unabated. The shortage of subsidiary currency is also one of the reasons. The revised total index for September rose from 885.55 in August to 959.04, an increase of 8.30 percent. Among the classified indexes, the food index has exceeded the 1,000 mark, and the clothing index has increased the most. The food index rose to 1070.51, housing to 725.17, clothing to 692.31, and miscellaneous items to 860.14, with increases ranging from 10.52 percent for rent. The purchasing power of national currency in September fell from 1 jiao, 1 fen, 2 li, 9 hao in August to 1 jiao, 0 fen, 4 li, 3 hao.</p>
<p>Rice prices fell this month. The price of small-grain rice at the Shanghai Municipal Council fell from 120 yuan to 117 yuan per picul. As a result, rice prices are falling faster, and with the good autumn harvest, stockpiles continue to increase. The Equalization Fund announced that it would allow settlements based on the statutory foreign exchange rate, and the situation in the Pacific has also improved. All of these factors have improved the situation for this major food item. The average retail price of small-grain rice in September was as low as 112 yuan, 9 jiao, 4 fen per picul, compared to 118 yuan, 9 jiao, 9 fen last month. The prices of other goods generally tended to rise. The retail market price of fresh fish this month increased by 47.54 percent compared to August, duck eggs by 39.17 percent, tofu, dried tofu, and fried tofu by 60.00 percent, foreign potatoes by 30.97 percent, firewood by 27.50 percent, and matches by 17.37 percent.

<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reports that the Thai cargo ship Suriyothai Nawa, originally scheduled to leave Shanghai three days ago for Hong Kong and Bangkok, has been detained by the Shanghai Customs authorities and has not yet been released. Customs officials have refused to comment on this matter, but it is rumored that the ship was detained because it was carrying goods prohibited from export. The Thai Sheng Li Company, the ship's management office in Shanghai, is in negotiations with Customs and the Japanese side, and it is hoped that a resolution will be reached soon. However, it is generally believed that the ship will not be granted export permission until the prohibited export goods are unloaded. The Suriyothai Nawa arrived in Shanghai for the first time on September 21, loaded with a large quantity of foreign rice from Bangkok. It was originally scheduled to set sail for its home country three days ago, but was suddenly detained by Customs and is currently docked at the Longmao Pier in Pudong, opposite the French Concession Bund.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Oil Tanker to Arrive in Shanghai at the End of the Month; Supply to Be Ample <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>An oil tanker sailing from the Dutch East Indies is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of October. The ship carries approximately three months' worth of gasoline for the city, which should greatly improve the gasoline situation in Shanghai and may make it possible to stop oil rationing. However, when oil company personnel answered reporters' questions, they stated emphatically that the arrival of the oil tanker in Shanghai would only provide temporary relief, so the public should continue to adhere to the oil rationing system.</p>
<p>Conserve Oil</p>
<p>It is reported that the oil tanker is expected to set sail from the Dutch East Indies in 16 days and arrive in Shanghai before the end of October, carrying gasoline for the three major foreign oil companies. People in the oil industry generally believe that the current situation in the Pacific is uncertain, and it cannot be guaranteed that the ship will arrive as scheduled. However, if the oil tanker from the Dutch East Indies does arrive in Shanghai, it will alleviate the crisis of dwindling oil reserves here. According to reporters' inquiries, two of the three major oil companies,</p>
<p>May Discontinue</p>
<p>Oil rationing, while the other does not intend to do so. Oil company personnel all said that it is necessary to have a long-term perspective, so the gasoline situation in Shanghai depends not only on the arrival of one oil tanker, but also on the overall situation in the Pacific. Yesterday morning (the 29th), about 80 people gathered at the Mobil Oil Company in the city to apply for oil rationing permits. Both Mobil Oil Company and Texaco Oil Company are accepting applications from new customers for oil rationing permits, but the Asia Oil Company's oil rationing permits are only issued to existing customers.</p>

<p>A report stated that on September 27th at 6:00 PM, the Chinese Christian Charitable Relief Association would stage a charity performance by famous opera singers at the Lyceum Theatre. It is now learned that the church has never used this method for fundraising. Inquiries were made immediately with various Christian churches, pastors, and evangelists' associations, and all stated that they had not heard of it. Since no church participated and no pastor knew about it, it is clear that charitable relief should be supported, but the procedure is improper and inevitably raises suspicions. Therefore, the Shanghai Christian Church Federation has issued a statement to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Ruogu, editor of the American-owned China-America Daily News, was arrested by Japanese military police in conjunction with French police officers in the French Concession at 1:00 PM on the 24th of this month and was transferred to Hongkou on the same day. Since Mr. Zhang's unexplained arrest, the newspaper's American legal advisor has reasoned with the Shanghai French Consul General. The Japanese side only returned Mr. Zhang to the French police station the day before yesterday afternoon. However, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the American legal advisor of the China-America Daily News suddenly received a notice from the French side stating that Mr. Zhang would be transferred for interrogation at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The notice did not mention what charges the police station would bring against Mr. Zhang. Upon hearing the news, Mr. Zhang's family immediately entrusted Dr. Pietro V. E. Terni, a well-known Italian lawyer in the city, to protect Mr. Zhang's human rights. Dr. Terni argued that since the police station had not announced Mr. Zhang's charges and the hearing time was at 3:00 PM, with notification only at 10:00 AM,</p>
<p>Protection procedures could not be carried out. He immediately applied to the French police station for a postponement of Mr. Zhang's transfer, which the police station granted. Mr. Zhang remains detained in the police station, and Dr. Terni is currently studying the details of the case and collecting necessary evidence to provide protection. Mr. Zhang is 37 years old, a native of Nanhui, and has lived in Shanghai for generations. His father and grandfather worked at the French Consulate in Shanghai for decades. His uncle, who passed away only three months ago, also worked at the French Consulate. Mr. Zhang's family are devout Catholics.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:45 PM, a Route 22 public bus (No. 8822) traveling from west to east was stopped at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Montigny. French police officers boarded the bus for a search. At that time, there was a man and a fashionable woman, about 30 years old, whose demeanor was quite suspicious. The detectives immediately stepped forward to conduct a thorough search and discovered a handgun and dozens of bullets in the woman's handbag. The man and woman were taken to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>Homeowner Received Phone Call Beforehand; Investigation Revealed Thugs Trying to Extort Money</p>
<p>At approximately 9:20 AM yesterday morning, a hand grenade was discovered in front of No. 1, Lane 34, Rue Henri, but it did not explode. The investigation revealed that this was an act of extortion by thugs and was not related to political activities. No. 1, Lane 34, is a three-story Russian-style house with a small garden in front, planted with several trees and flowers. The homeowner, Tao Jianwei, formerly the manager of the Bund Branch of the Bank of Communications in Shanghai and a native of Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, has been unemployed for a long time and is doing nothing. Unexpectedly, as the saying goes, "Misfortune comes from above when sitting at home behind closed doors." On the morning of the 19th of this month, Tao suddenly received a threatening letter demanding 100,000 yuan from him. The letter also contained two bullets. However, the addressee on the letter was "Tao Zuichou." Tao, feeling that it was not his business, suspected that it was a mistake and did not pay attention to it or report it to the police station. Subsequently, five more letters arrived, with many threats. Tao told them, "This is not Tao Zuichou's residence, you can come and investigate." Unexpectedly, at approximately 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the thugs seized an opportunity to place a wooden-handled hand grenade wrapped in old newspaper in front of the house's main gate. At the time, the Tao family did not notice. At approximately 10:00 AM, a phone call came, claiming, "There is already a bomb in front of your house. If you continue to ignore it, you will regret it," etc. Therefore, Tao instructed someone to check in front of the gate and indeed saw a paper-wrapped hand grenade in front of the gate. He immediately reported it to the French police station, who sent officers to take the grenade back for investigation. At the same time, he strictly ordered his subordinates to arrest all the thugs who carried out the threats.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Commemorating the Unknown Inventor <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Ye</p>
<p>Please Read This, Industrial and Commercial Circles</p>
<p>Reading the Hong Kong newspaper, recounting the invention of the fluorescent tube, there is a page of sad history for our industry. In order to commemorate this Chinese youth who devoted himself to research but did not achieve his goal, and to encourage our Shanghai industrial and commercial circles today, I am recording this:</p>
<p>"...The first inventor of the fluorescent tube was a young apprentice surnamed Feng from a light bulb factory in Shanghai. Feng had a talent for scientific research. One day, he saw a damaged neon tube and obtained chemicals that emitted electrons from the factory. He unintentionally researched and obtained a result, determining that electric tubes could emit light without using filaments. Based on this principle, he invented a filament-free light bulb. The factory owner saw him burying himself in this all day, delaying his duties, and immediately discarded his experimental equipment. Feng then explained the process and asked for funding, but the factory owner not only did not help but also expelled him. After leaving the factory, Feng sought investment everywhere and managed to raise 2,000 yuan, but it was not enough to purchase equipment. The experimental results showed that the light was emitted but not bright and difficult to sustain. Feng was greatly stimulated, life was difficult, and he worked too hard, so he coughed up blood and died."</p>
<p>After reading this record, our thoughts, first of all, are not to use the spirit of Ah Q to defend that Western civilization is still behind Eastern civilization, but to prove that scientific research in Eastern civilization really lacks the help of society and the nation. Mr. Feng grew up in this environment and became an unknown hero who coughed up blood and died. Now that American fluorescent tubes have arrived in Shanghai, everyone welcomes the new and sends off the old, happily enjoying them. Even this light bulb factory, fearing the future of the light bulb business, may have installed fluorescent lights or hired imitators to "copy" them. How emotional and painful this is.</p>
<p>We think of many employees in various industries who are buried in hard work. We have also specially organized scholarships for industrial and commercial employees to cultivate their desire to learn. Here, we are even more convinced of the weakness of our strength. There are really many industrial and commercial employees who need to be encouraged.</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the industrial and commercial circles, the times are urging us to save the country through science. I hope that in addition to thinking about business, you will love and help employees who devote their hearts and minds to hard work and research. If you are unable to help, as long as their research has considerable significance and results, you should also introduce them to society to expect the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>Mr. Feng coughed up blood and died, and fluorescent tubes were also transported from abroad. I hope we will never see records of this "kind of burying young people due to the environment" again. Then, even if Mr. Feng did not succeed in inventing the fluorescent tube, he has invented everything for the future, filling the old and rugged road for future inventors.</p>
<p>At night, close the door to sweep the floor, move the sock machine away, and put the planks on the frame to serve as a dormitory. As long as the upstairs neighbors don't get angry, I can sleep soundly. When I wake up early, "the old man shouts loudly," and my work begins. Someone asked me, "How do you feel about living 'with dust during the day and with fleas at night'?" I smiled and replied, "Don't underestimate me? The factory girls treat me like an engineer, factory director, and accountant!" You think, if I leave this factory, who has a position waiting for me?</p>
<h3 id="e78">Life's Circle: The Truly Capable Are Overworked - Engineer, Factory Manager, Accountant <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>In this modern Shanghai society, who would believe there are 18th-century alleyway factories? I am honored to work in such a factory. I am busy all day long, I am the accountant, I am the manager, I am the veteran clerk, I even sweep the floor and empty the chamber pots. I even carry the boss's baby and buy snacks for them. It sounds like I have great power and look glorious, but I only get twenty yuan a month. Do you think the treatment in the factory is good?</p>
<p>It might seem unbelievable! Don't underestimate this one-story building. The upstairs is the boss's residence, and the attic is used as a warehouse for goods. The entire downstairs is the factory building for our company, from the courtyard to the kitchen, the production line is arranged – the sock knitting machines. As for the balcony, it's naturally the kitchen. From top to bottom, front to back, the boss really put his mind to building such a strangely named sock factory.</p>
<p>Although the place is small, business is very busy. There's both night and day work, the rattling sounds [of the machines], and the laughter of the female workers, singing and answering each other; when there is nothing to do, I chat and flirt with the female workers, and when the boss's wife sees it, she gives me a glare and scolds me, "You little devil!"</p>
<p>All day long, I am busy with bookkeeping, delivering goods, packaging, purchasing, carrying the baby, ordering snacks, emptying chamber pots, and checking inventory... Sometimes, when the boss's wife is busy, I also have to buy groceries and start the stove. It's truly a one-person operation, playing all roles.</p>
<p>The boss gets up late and goes to bed late. He gets up at ten o'clock and goes out to deal with factory affairs, returning home every midnight. He's either "playing mahjong" or "going to the company to find the female clerk." In the middle of the night, the boss's wife throws a tantrum, making the light fixture under the ceiling shake. Suddenly, "bang! suddenly crash!" The boss's wife is jumping on the ceiling, scaring the rats in the house from scurrying out. The floor is covered with broken glass. The boss's wife's temper gets worse and worse, but the boss remains "逍遙法外" [unpunished].</p>

<p>12. Unexpected Storm</p>
<p>Zhang Lao Liu sat in the main room, watching them all walk across the street, being welcomed inside by Manager Meng as if he were greeting a superior. They didn't come out until after two o'clock.</p>
<p>"Lao Meng is sucking up to them like that, they mustn't be planning anything good!" Zhang Lao Liu said with much integrity while discussing with his boss.</p>
<p>Begonia felt anxious after hearing this, but Yu Kun hadn't returned yet, so he couldn't even talk to him.</p>
<p>Luckily, heaven had mercy on him, and he didn't have to worry about this for too long. That night at nine o'clock, Lao Meng quietly walked over with his daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>"Brother Wu hasn't rested yet?" As soon as he entered the room, he greeted Begonia with a face full of smiles.</p>
<p>Begonia, of course, couldn't be cold to him, and they exchanged pleasantries in a friendly manner for a while.</p>
<p>"I want to have a heart-to-heart talk with you, Brother Wu. Would you please ask Little Dog's brother to sit outside for a while?" Old Man Meng specially stood up from a chair, moved to Begonia's bed to sit, and seemed quite sincere.</p>
<p>Before Begonia could speak, Zhang Lao Liu heard and automatically walked out. The Meng family's little treasurer even pushed the door closed. (225)</p>

<p>Mrs. He felt "off" and uncomfortable when she got up this morning, because she had been playing mahjong too late last night. So she decided to see a doctor.</p>
<p>The doctor said, "Madam's illness is entirely due to overwork. You should bathe often, breathe more fresh air, and wear more comfortable, light clothing."</p>
<p>When Mrs. He returned home, Mr. He was already waiting anxiously outside the door, and carefully asked, "Darling, what did the doctor tell you?"</p>
<p>"The doctor said I should often go to the beach to enjoy the sun, take more car rides, and make some new, fashionable clothes."</p>

<p>— Qu Qing</p>
<p>The title of Chess Master, equivalent to 9-dan in Japan, should first unite domestic Go players and unanimously honor Mr. Wu Qingyuan as our country's Chess Master, that is, the first Chess Master in our country. (Higher titles such as Chess Sage and Chess Immortal can be reserved for the future.) Also, we request that all existing masters in our country send their game records to the Chess Master for review and to determine their rank, to be used as the ratio for black and white and the handicap. The promotion of the three chess seats and the three degrees should be presided over by the Chess Master. The promotion of the nine levels of Go players should be entrusted to domestic Go associations designated by the Chess Master to handle the matter. The results of the competition should be used as the standard for promotion. As for the competition rules, time calculation, and score calculation, domestic Go players should carefully consult and formulate them, and send them to the Chess Master for review before they are established as regulations. If Mr. Wu agrees to serve as the Chess Master, and domestic Go players can abide by and follow his guidance, then our country's Go community will be somewhat organized, and there will be hope for gradual prosperity. The emergence of talents is inherently a matter of chance, but if things continue to be so scattered, even if there are talented people, they will not have the convenience of guidance and promotion, and they will lose the opportunity for maximum development, which is a great pity! This matter is related to the country, society, and economic conditions, which will not be discussed in detail here.</p>
<p>The organization of Go associations is the most urgent task. It should be named the Chinese Go Association or the Go Society. It is heard that a Go association has recently been established in Shanghai, and famous players such as Gu ShuiRu, Wei HaiHong, and Wang YouChen have been invited to play games from time to time. It seems that these famous players should be asked to send the saved diagrams to Wu Qingyuan for evaluation and publication, to increase the interest of the Go community. It is also hoped that Go enthusiasts in the country will not only regard it as an amateur pastime, but should also simultaneously seek to improve their skills and cultivate talent, which will be of great benefit to the Go community, and it is a very far-reaching goal.</p>
<p>Go enthusiasts who have the intention to assist in the organization or express opinions, please send them to the Arts and Entertainment section of both Shen Bao newspaper.</p>

<p>Since the Old Master Gao couldn't get JueMin to come back, and he also secretly heard about YunHua's affair, he felt that the authority of the head of the family had been completely swept away. He was already brewing a kind of unhappiness in his heart. At this time, JueXin's fifth uncle, Gao KeDing, was indulging in prostitution and gambling outside, and got to know a local prostitute. He actually lived with her and made her his concubine. Because of the huge debt, he even sold his wife's jewelry. When the Old Master Gao found out about this, he became even more furious. Although he tried his best to teach KeDing a lesson, the Old Master Gao also fell ill.</p>
<p>The Old Master Gao's condition worsened day by day. And JueMin still hadn't returned home. The Old Master Gao knew that he was about to die, and gradually realized something. So, on a dark, moonless night, he called JueHui to his bedside, expressed his understanding of JueMin, and voluntarily cancelled the marriage arrangement with the Feng family, wanting JueHui to bring JueMin back. JueHui knew that this matter had been won, and hurriedly went to find JueMin. At the same time, Commander Zhang was dismissed by his superiors for being too perverse, and his power suddenly collapsed. So, Zhang YunHua's affair also ended by itself.</p>
<p>After JueHui found JueMin, they hurried home, but the Old Master was already in a dying state. They managed to wake him up, and he only encouraged JueMin, JueHui, and the others with a few words before passing away.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Anger Over a Beauty</p>
<p>When Zhang CangQiu first heard that the capital had fallen and Chongzhen had died, he stamped his feet repeatedly to Chen Fei, saying, "Oh dear! Our troops departed too late! How could the bandits have captured the capital without us getting there first? Such a good emperor actually died for his country, and the Ming dynasty has collapsed. What should we military personnel do? Should we not dishevel our hair and hurry to the rescue? How could General Wu receive such news and yet remain stationary? It's so strange!" Chen Fei also said, "Those hateful bandits dared to capture the imperial capital, and the officials guarding the capital are too incompetent. Why couldn't they hold out for a month or half a month until our reinforcements arrived?" The two spoke, sighing and feeling indignant. They hurried to see Ma Bao. Zhang CangQiu opened his mouth and said, "The bandits have broken into the capital, and the emperor has died for his country. This is truly a cataclysmic event, and we are deeply saddened. General Wu is ordered to protect the capital. Why doesn't he quickly rush to Yanjing, capture and kill the bandit leader, and restore the country, so that he can be worthy of the emperor's spirit in heaven? If he lingers here, allowing the bandits' arrogance to increase, how can it be good for the country? Please ask the commander to convey our feelings to General Wu. We are willing to go to war with the bandits, even if it means death." Ma Bao listened to Zhang CangQiu's words and knew that although Zhang CangQiu and others were of low rank, they were loyal and righteous men who regarded death as home. So, he comforted Zhang CangQiu and Chen Fei, saying, "What you two are asking for is exactly what I want. I will report to the general. I believe General Wu will have a way to handle it." Zhang and Chen then withdrew. However, for three consecutive days, Wu Sangui remained stationary.</p>
