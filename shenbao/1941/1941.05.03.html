<h3 id="c10">工部局定米出售問題 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>今日上海之米市，誠可謂極波譎雲詭之大觀。評價辦法旣無形消滅，而突頒新限價之後，又不事講求市塲善後方策，一任暗盤貼價飛躍橫跳，終於莫明其所以而重行撒銷。米商本已視限價若無物，禁令若弁髦，及當局一再自毀其威信，長奸商之氣燄，而致一百五十元一市石之目標，竟得如願以償；米商固腰槖纍纍，大衆則餓鄉在望，此豈「正常業米力面」所應出此耶！夫所謂正常生意者，乃從供求之正常規律，而市况隨以變遷之謂也。今則上海存米僅就堆棧所計，有一百數十萬包；每日到米，只就本報調查，日有數萬包；來源未嘗中斷，消費無所增减，存米只見增加，而米價日漲數元，昂進不已；遂有「欲發橫財，莫如囤米」云云，奸儈昌言無忌，恣意肆爲；此所以殘賊社會者，雖未越貨於市，殺人於途，而其情其跡，則固掠奪無分貧富，殺人不流滴血，罪實浮於盜匪。奈何尙以正常業務目之，不加干涉，此無怪奸商之胆愈張，而民食之困難愈深也。</p>
<p>上海之囤米奸商，毒如蛇蝎，貪比虎狼，上海人知之，天下人聞之矣，顧無如今日之醜惡畢露者。工部局欲令其推銷港米，托詞謂現米已極昂貴，再經行商轉手，徒增成本，不若由米號直接購銷，庶食戶多受實惠之爲愈云云，彼自以爲悅耳動聽矣，自以爲冠冕堂皇矣，其實誰不知其爲喪盡天良之辭。夫工部局豈不知多經一轉手，多加一筆佣，終爲民食之負担；工部局豈不自知非商業機關，今已不得已而運米發賣，無非想加惠居民；而仍欲米商效經售之勞者，初不僅爲方便計，亦以爲事屬公益性質，米商不盡奸商耳，是在業中人應如何藉此機會，努力奉公，以與奸儈分別薰蕕善惡耶？乃竟以決議之方式，悍然拒絕，於是而赤裸裸其爲蛇蝎虎狼矣。考其存心，祗爲有二萬五千噸洋米，按月供給，差副市民所需，則千倉萬箱纍纍所囤積於棧房者，非但不能操縱自然，亦且不能如目前之售善價；而工部局開此先例之後，米業將永無操縱之機會耳。抑我人對此，有最懷疑者，業中人豈盡虎狼蛇蝎耶，豈盡喪盡天良耶，不然，何以皇皇然作此決議，絕不爲全業稍留臉面耶？若非全業，究竟誰是個中蟊賊？</p>
<p>此事在工部局方面，獲得港政府之協助，按月可運小絞米二萬噸乃至二萬五千噸來滬，以資調劑，而以合理之售價，售給大衆，是誠民食之喜訊，抑亦工部局關於民食之初步成功也。今後所應往意者，如何分配，使此種米糧，能公允實惠入於消費者之手？米行業旣拒銷於前，工部局應如何別求更好之銷售方法？我人固絕不憂疑於工部局因此而竟無法脫手，食戶因此而竟無法購求；而對於如此喪盡天良之徒，吾人尤絕不願工部局放縱之，曲宥之，而不予懲儆！意想所及，米號業准許營業之權，操之於工部局之手，則取締自有其「必要」，且有其可能。同時獎勵米業中之眞能奉公守法者，樂於經售。經售之處，工部局應頒給米樣玻匣，陳列於櫃檯顯明之處，使食戶照樣採購。自此之後，工部局並應竭力設法，使此項米糧，不以任何事故發生，而至中斷，終須源源接濟，爲民食造福。再則目前之價格，爲每市石一百十元，衡之於一般生活程度，尙嫌其貴，此後能否在可能範圍內設法使之减低。又平價之米糧，如何防範，不轉輾流入於囤戶之手，供其利用，爲害民食，事頗複雜，皆應顧及。吾人深覺上海民食問題，經工部局一番努力，已有一綫曙光，惟前途之暗礁尙多，深賴柁師之力，渡此灘嶮，是上海社會治安之幸也。</p>

<h3 id="c89">民有飢色 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 潘禮</p>
<p>德國在歐洲發動大規模的戰事以後，就有社會學家預言歐洲大陸將遭遇空前水有的大飢荒。不久以前，法國的名科學家卡萊爾從美國回歐洲去，目的是在調查法國淪陷區中飢荒的程度，希望能用科學的方法使民衆獲得充分的營養。可見歐洲民食問題的嚴重情形。</p>
<p>在我們眼前所看利的飢民載這，搶米案件的層出不窮，民食的成問題也可以不必說了。</p>
<p>目前最富庶之區，常推西半球的美利堅了。可是很奇怪，美國的民食據說也很成問題。四年前美國總統羅斯福在就位二屆總統的演詞中，提到「全國三分之一的民衆營養不足」。據最近的調查，這並不是過甚其詞。全美國在十家人家中，吃不够飽的有四家。照這樣估計起來，號稱黃金國的美國的有一千三百萬家人家吃不够飽。其他各國的民食情形，也就可想而知了。</p>
<p>掙扎在飢餓綫上的人應該明白，此等現象都是人爲的。也唯有用人的力量，才能把這種現象改正過來。</p>

<h3 id="c90">嫁後 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 冰虹</p>
<p>嫁後，雖然我的工作還是和從前差不多，生活上却起了很大的變化。</p>
<p>淸早，從夢中醒來，摸出枕畔的錶，用力張開綳緊的眼睛，瞧瞧只有六時半，尙能從容地做完梳洗工作，到廚房去預備早餐，再不能像住宿在學校時一般鑽在被窩裏，坐起倒下，倒下坐起，等到稀飯來了才肯「正式」起身。現在呢？像逃難一般，在明凈的天氣還好，吞了稀飯就好走。要是下雨天，眞糟糕，穿套鞋，帶雨傘，再挾了一包棉鞋，披上龐腫的大衣，在泥濘的道路上趕到電車站，常常覺得盲腸發痛。</p>
<p>每當我早晨離開家的時候，『他』還是迷朦矇地問我：「什麼時候了？」這時，我常會妒忌他，也是羨慕他，能够比我多睡；寫字間又近，不必坐車。我委實恨他太自私，不去找一處靠近我學校的房子。想到這裏，就不高興去理他。但他並沒有恨我，却會仰起上身，溫存地說：「車錢帶了嗎？可不要帶了手套去，外面怪冷的。」樣，我使要懺悔了，跑過去和他握手，覺得眞的愛情，決不該妒忌和自私的。雖然我勞苦些，但他的舒適，能使我安慰，這安慰更能鼓勵我的辛勞。</p>
<p>踏着恬靜的街道，冰冷的早風迎面撲來，却沒有帶來絲毫初春的味道，使嚥下去的唾液，含有幾成凝結的泥沙。菜販成羣地趕向市塲去，那種急促的步履，像編着卽奏一般。蘇州河上的船戶，浮漾在夢也似的濃霧中。兩岸的高房子，也像披上一層靑紗。太陽的影子還埋在朦朧的雲堆裏。唉！眞是一幅美麗的晨曦圖啊！</p>
<p>跨上電車，鬆了口氣。直到進了學校，聽見孩子們唱晨會歌的歌聲，才把心上的鉛塊落下。「上課，」「下課，」從八點半到下午四時，除了午餐與數分鐘下課以外，便沒有休息的時候。在這樣忙碌中，我來不及想我的煩惱，也忘記了家中公公惡狠狠的嘴臉，和婆婆冷冰冰的語氣。</p>
<p>晚餐後，改完了卷子，搭上熟悉的車子，走羞熟習的路……發軟的腿，疲重的腦，喊啞的喉嚨，跟着呼吸發痛。我像戰塲上敗兵，是那麼地倦乏。當沉重步伐重復拖上天后宮橋時，那美麗的蘇州河夜色，立刻呈現在我的目前，使我胸襟感到爽快。高房中的燈火像點點的星星也似地明暗相映着，反射到起伏的水中，變成片片銀盾，是那麽多，那麼可愛，更閃鑠得像明珠，鑽石，不，還像無數的眼睛；天眞純潔的眼睛，靜坐在位置上聽坦師講話的孩子的眼睛……。哦！這眼睛是多麽明亮燦爛，充滿着無窮的希望；無窮的意志，無窮的前途……。他們等待着我們去栽培，磨練，他們需要我們去灌溉，我們的辛勞也會爲了他們！</p>
<p>我一面想，一面走，我急盼望快些到家，『家』可以讓我安息。</p>
<p>他總是每天比我先到一步。一進門就可以看見他坐在寫字檯前的背影，不是寫字，就是看書。從我反對以後，再不見他抽烟，喝酒來消遣。房間巳被人打掃淸潔，但那打掃，不像自已做的週到。洗完了衣襪，還得修補。他有時彈起琴來，我就隨口哼些曲子。但，沙啞的嗓子，使我自已不願再唱下去。誰都替我惋惜，昔日的歌喉，從結婚中就喪失了。每晚我總懷着十二分信心，盼望早日恢復，晤暗的向上帝祝禱。</p>
<p>臨睡的時候，照例到公婆處去請安。他們圍坐一桌，嘻喀哈哈，一見了我，公就板起面孔，把身子轉了過去。婆呢；對我冷冷地瞄了一眼，習慣地說了一句：「剛回來嗎？」我只得敷衍了一會，退了出來。唉！他們不是我的父母，他們不會像我的父母那般愛我，他們不歡喜他的兒子，連對我也是這樣。他們不讚成我到外面去工作，更不高興他的兒子允許我終日不在家守三從四德。他們想把我束縛起來，服從他們的命令，做他們家庭的奴隸！</p>
<p>回到房裏，我沒有做聲，也做不出聲。終於他是瞭解我的，放下工作，跑到我身邊，拭去我的眼淚認眞地說「虹！別傷心，這家庭不是我們，，我們的正待開闢，一切請你忍耐吧。再過二年，待我略有發展，那時我們可以脫離這個樊籠，創造新的環境，自由自在地好過快活的生活了。目前的痛苦，堅忍一下吧！」他這誠懇的語調，鼓動了我的毅力，我相信他，期待他，眞有這樣的一日。</p>

<p>「噲！吳老板，大帥有話問你！」季兆雄早把秋海棠再三接濟他的情誼忘得乾乾凈凈了，心裏所剩留着的，只是最近兩次索詐米遂的忿恨；他一抬手便揪定了秋海棠的長髮，硬生生地把他的頭拉起來。</p>
<p>同時老袁也開口了。</p>
<p>「好小子，你太忘本啦！」他的眼珠睜得像龍眼一樣的圓，比起七八年前，他在廣德　拼命　秋海棠　好的時的神氣，又另有一種令人害怕的聲勢。——簡直可以說是一團殺氣。「不想想這幾年來要是沒有我姓袁的捧塲，你能有這麽一天嗎？別的我現在也不跟你多說，只問你除了你那個死丫頭之外還有誰跟你們拉馬？」秋海棠緊閉着眼睛，只當沒有聽見一樣。</p>
<p>「你想裝聾嗎？老實給你說，裏頭的那惆已給我做了一頓，全說出來了。這個老田媽就曾在糧米街碰到過你！」袁寳藩的手向左邊一個神氣奸詐得不輸如季兆雄的老媽子指了一指。</p>
<p>同時季兆雄的手裏又猛可一用力，差一些就把秋海棠的一簇長髮揪下來。</p>
<p>這個狗仗人勢的奴才所給予他的侮辱，以及袁寳藩所說過的「裏頭那」個巳給我做了一頓全說出來了」的一句話立刻合成了一服極强烈的刺激劑，使秋海棠原有的那種羞愧害怕的心裏，頓時變爲不可抑制的暴怒。（九六）</p>

<p>— 葛乃灃</p>
<p>霞飛路上海音樂館，近奉教部訓令，改組爲私立音樂專科學校，現已着手進行，爲籌劃經費，特定五日六日舉行教授音樂會。</p>
<p>上海音樂館產生於民國二十六年。當時鋼琴家丁善德先生從北平國立女師南返，因鑒於國內造就音樂專門人材的學校除了國立音專外，其他尚付缺如，所以決意創辦私立上海音樂館，負起音樂教育的責任來。</p>
<p>學習任何學術，基礎一堅固，將來才會有自己的前途，學習音樂尤其應該如此，要是像學習歌唱的，對呼吸法開頭一馬虎，那你的歌聲就永遠沒有造就了。初學鋼琴提琴的對指法跟姿勢隨隨便便，那你休想有得進步。上海音樂館教學素主嚴格，絕不遷就學生；因此許多了解音樂藝術的青年學生，向學者在一百左右，最近竟至無法收納。</p>
<p>該館教授十多位，全是聞名已久的音樂家。鋼琴教授丁善德爲柴哈洛夫的高足，早幾畢業於國立音專。歷次演奏，博得中外人士之好評。提琴教授陳又新爲國立音專開辦以來僅有的提琴系畢業生。　位中的一位，造詣之深，毋庸贅述。聲樂教授朱琦爲許士林教授的高足，其他外籍教授有B.Zakharoff　A.　Foa　V.Shushlin等海上音樂名家，均親自擔任教授。</p>
<p>他們每學期有經常的音樂會舉行，開辦迄今已演出十餘次，目前校舍不敷，無法擴充學額，已着手另覔校舍，從事改組，添設本科師範科二部。此次假座蘭心大戲院舉行首次教授音樂大會，券資所得，作爲改組費用，屆時盛況，不言而喻了。</p>

<p>A Chinese military spokesman in Chongqing stated today regarding the failed Japanese attempt to send a foreign minister to the United States to conclude a non-aggression pact, believing it to be plausible. The spokesman said that Japan is facing military difficulties in mainland China and is therefore attempting to improve diplomatic relations. The spokesman also stated that the Japanese report of 2,000 Chinese troops entering Burma is actually a pretext for the Japanese army themselves to ravage Thailand and Burma. The more than one million Japanese troops in mainland China have clearly realized the hopelessness of the war against China and are feeling weary. Therefore, apart from coastal battles, they cannot achieve any further success. The spokesman also said that he had not heard whether the Japanese army had withdrawn from Manchuria after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. The spokesman further predicted that the Japanese army would launch an offensive in central China in the near future, as the Japanese army has concentrated in the western and southern parts of Hubei. This offensive may proceed west from Yichang or south towards Changsha. The spokesman concluded by saying that the Chinese are prepared to deal with all situations. If the Japanese army launches an offensive in the central part of the Yangtze River basin, they will inevitably be defeated by the Chinese army. (1st Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Problem of the Bureau of Public Works Selling Rice <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Today's rice market in Shanghai can truly be described as a spectacle of extreme volatility. The price assessment method was abolished invisibly, and after the sudden issuance of a new price limit, no efforts were made to seek follow-up measures for the market. Instead, the market was left to its own devices, with black market premiums jumping wildly until, inexplicably, it was repealed again. Rice merchants had already regarded the price limit as nothing and the bans as trifling matters. As the authorities repeatedly undermined their own credibility, the arrogance of unscrupulous merchants grew, and the goal of 150 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure) was finally achieved as desired. Rice merchants have fattened their purses, while the masses are facing starvation. Is this what "normal rice business" should lead to? So-called normal business refers to the normal laws of supply and demand, with market conditions changing accordingly. Currently, Shanghai's rice reserves, based solely on warehouse figures, amount to more than one million bags. Daily rice arrivals, according to our newspaper's investigations, reach tens of thousands of bags. The source has not been interrupted, consumption has not increased or decreased, and rice reserves are only increasing, yet the price of rice rises by several yuan every day, soaring continuously. As a result, unscrupulous merchants unscrupulously declare, "If you want to get rich quick, hoard rice!" Although this does not involve stealing goods in the market or killing people on the road, its nature and consequences are a form of plunder that spares neither the rich nor the poor, and is akin to bloodless murder. Yet, it is still regarded as normal business and not interfered with. No wonder the unscrupulous merchants are growing bolder, and the food difficulties of the people are deepening.</p>
<p>The rice-hoarding unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai are as venomous as snakes and as greedy as wolves. The people of Shanghai know this, and the world has heard of it. However, there has never been such a blatant display of ugliness as there is today. The Bureau of Public Works wants to have them sell Hong Kong rice, claiming that the current rice is already extremely expensive, and that going through merchants will only increase costs. It would be better for rice shops to buy and sell directly, so that more households can receive practical benefits, or so they say. They think it sounds pleasing to the ear, and that it is high-sounding, but who doesn't know that it is a heartless statement? Does the Bureau of Public Works not know that each additional intermediary adds a commission, which ultimately burdens the people's food supply? Does the Bureau of Public Works not know that it is not a commercial organization, and that its current involvement in transporting and selling rice is solely to benefit residents? Why then, do they still want rice merchants to provide the labor of distribution? Not only is it for convenience, but also because it is considered a public service. Not all rice merchants are unscrupulous, and those in the industry should take this opportunity to serve the public and distinguish themselves from the unscrupulous. Yet, they flatly refused by way of a resolution, thus revealing themselves nakedly as snakes and wolves. Their intention is simply because the 25,000 tons of foreign rice supplied monthly are insufficient to meet the needs of the citizens, and they can no longer manipulate the massive quantities of rice they have hoarded in warehouses, nor can they sell it at the high prices they currently enjoy. Once the Bureau of Public Works sets this precedent, the rice industry will never have the opportunity to manipulate prices again. Furthermore, we have the greatest suspicion: Are all members of the industry tigers, wolves, snakes, and scorpions? Are they all completely heartless? If not, why would they make such a hasty resolution, without leaving any face for the entire industry? If not the entire industry, then who are the moths among them?</p>
<p>In this matter, the Bureau of Public Works has obtained the assistance of the Hong Kong government, which can ship 20,000 to 25,000 tons of Xiao Jiao rice to Shanghai each month to stabilize the market and sell it to the public at reasonable prices. This is truly good news for the people's food supply and the first success of the Bureau of Public Works in addressing the food problem. The important thing to consider going forward is how to distribute this rice so that it can fairly and effectively reach the hands of consumers. Since the rice industry has refused to sell it, how should the Bureau of Public Works seek a better sales method? We have no doubt that the Bureau of Public Works will be unable to dispose of the rice and that households will be unable to purchase it. However, we absolutely do not want the Bureau of Public Works to indulge, condone, or fail to punish such heartless individuals! It occurs to us that the right to approve business licenses for rice shops is in the hands of the Bureau of Public Works, so there is a "necessity" and a possibility for suppression. At the same time, we should reward those in the rice industry who are truly able to serve the public and abide by the law and are happy to distribute rice. At the point of distribution, the Bureau of Public Works should issue glass boxes with rice samples displayed prominently on the counter, so that households can purchase rice according to the samples. From now on, the Bureau of Public Works should do everything possible to ensure that this rice supply is not interrupted by any accident and continue to provide a steady supply to benefit the people's food. Furthermore, the current price of 110 yuan per shi is still too expensive in light of the general standard of living. Can it be reduced within the possible range in the future? Also, how to prevent flat-price rice from being diverted into the hands of hoarders, who would exploit it and harm the people's food supply, is a complex matter that must be considered. We deeply feel that the Shanghai food problem has seen a glimmer of hope thanks to the efforts of the Bureau of Public Works. However, there are still many hidden reefs ahead, and we rely heavily on the helmsman to navigate through these treacherous waters. This is fortunate for the social order of Shanghai.</p>

Guo also called on the United States not to sell any more raw materials to Japan, and guaranteed that China would never stop fighting the aggressors, no matter what. This was Guo's first public speech since arriving here from London. He made this speech at a banquet hosted by the American Institute of Pacific Relations, the Chinese Association in America, the Chinese Benevolent Association, the Shanghai Luncheon Club, and the United China Relief at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Guo said that the naval and land goals of Britain and the United States are inseparably linked to China's ability to prevent Japan from consolidating its imperialism in the Pacific. He said, "Today, countless enlightened people in the United States know that if Britain is the European front line of the United States, then China is the Asian front line of the United States. As the war is tending to expand to the South Pacific, China's plans for the current democratic countries will gradually become important partners. As the war has spread to the whole of Burma and Singapore, the southwestern provinces of China will become the main base of operations. Southwest China will be the turning point for democratic countries in the Pacific War. Therefore, your country (referring to the United States), Britain, and China have a common relationship. I deeply hope that your country can do its best to help us to consolidate the defense of this region. I dare to appeal to the American people that your country should stop supplying raw materials to Japan, especially oil and other military supplies. In the past, the United States supplied these items to Japan, enabling the Japanese army and its air force to kill our women and children and destroy our houses and factories." Dr. Guo Taiqi then paid tribute to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, calling him a symbol of China's unity and the driving force behind its resistance to Japan. Guo said, "China's future freedom and independence will largely depend on the speed and thoroughness with which the United States helps China. Our biggest problem today is the attitude and method of cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States. This combination of ABC (America, Britain, China) is not only aimed at forming a united spiritual front line, but also at concentrating our economic and natural resources. We face many difficulties at present, and the task is extremely difficult. Whether we stand or fall depends on whether we deeply understand this task and undertake it with the greatest courage and speed." Guo also said that China, almost bare-handed, has proven its ability to resist Japan and has brought one million Japanese troops in China to a standstill. He also said, "It is true that the Chinese people have suffered enormous losses in terms of material, territory, and life, but we know that if we value freedom, this is the price of freedom. We seek nothing but freedom. China has been wounded, but it has not been defeated. China will hold on to its guns in any environment and deeply trust China's friends. China will continue to move forward, regardless of its fate." (2nd Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Iraq's Attitude Suddenly Changes; British-Iraqi Relations Tense; Iraq Opposes the Continued Dispatch of British Troops to Land; Troops Concentrated at Key Points for Defense <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>London: Authoritative sources here declared yesterday that the second batch of British troops had landed in Iraq despite protests from the Iraqi government. At the same time, the British Ambassador to Iraq, Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, demanded the immediate withdrawal of the large Iraqi army near the British air base of Habbaniya. Cornwallis said that the presence of the Iraqi army "may cause unfortunate incidents for which the Iraqi government should be fully responsible." The Iraqi government has protested to the British authorities, saying that no more troops can be dispatched to land until the first batch of British troops has left the country. In his reply, Cornwallis insisted that Britain had the right to fulfill the treaty under the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. Authoritative sources revealed that the British troops' actions "are proceeding according to plan and the second batch of troops has arrived in Basra." It is learned that recently, when a riot occurred, Britain authorized Sir Kinahan Cornwallis to take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of British women and children in Iraq. (2nd Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic reporter has learned that London has received reports from Baghdad stating that some difficulties have arisen regarding the arrival of British troops in Iraq. Initially, when the British troops had not yet arrived in Basra, Iraq, the Iraqi government agreed to open the transportation lines through the country as stipulated in the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. Subsequently, Iraq received a notice from Britain informing them that the reinforcements to strengthen the British army would soon arrive in Iraq. They then said that the British troops already in Iraq had not yet left, and that the arrival of British troops could not be allowed to continue at this time. However, the British government was unwilling to abandon its treaty rights and therefore continued according to the pre-arranged plan, with the reinforcements landing in Basra without incident. However, some Iraqi troops are now concentrating, seemingly threatening the security of the British air base in Habbaniya, about 6,000 miles west of Basra. Therefore, the British are currently urging the Iraqi government to transfer its troops as soon as possible to avoid any unexpected incidents. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic reporter has learned that in the past few hours, a rather tense situation has developed in Iraq. The Iraqi authorities have gathered a large number of troops around the British airfield in Habbaniya, sixty miles west of Baghdad. The British government has pressured the Iraqi authorities to withdraw their troops, saying that if an accident occurs as a result, all responsibility will be borne by the Iraqi side. As of now, the Iraqi authorities do not seem to have adopted this approach, so the situation is quite critical. It is reported that British troops landed in Basra not long ago in accordance with the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, and subsequently more troops were sent to the area in accordance with the treaty, all without incident. At this point, the attitude of the Iraqi authorities suddenly changed, expressing dissatisfaction with the continued arrival of British troops. The British government is doing its best to maintain its treaty rights. According to the information currently received here, there have been no developments in other parts of Iraq. It is not yet known whether the British have demanded that the Iraqi troops withdraw by a deadline. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Beirut: Britain's continued request to send troops to land in Basra has made British-Iraqi relations even more strained. The Iraqi government issued a communiqué yesterday afternoon stating that the Iraqi government has taken various steps to fulfill the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, allowing British troops to land in Basra and transit through Iraq. However, Britain has made requests that violate the treaty, and the Iraqi government has had to take necessary measures to protect various rights. The Iraqi people should remain calm and trust the government's measures. (2nd Haisong Society dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Britain yesterday quickly mustered its Middle East forces to protect the Mosul oilfields, as the second brigade of the British Expeditionary Force landed in Flurak despite protests from the Baghdad government. Authoritative sources in London learned that British people in Iraqi territory are establishing a strong supply base and improving various transportation lines in preparation for the war to spread to the country. It is said that after these transportation lines are improved, British troops can quickly rush to aid if Germany attacks Balikstan, Turkey, or even Syria. It is also said that British troops are patrolling the Mosul oil wells and refineries, and heavy troops have been added to protect the oil pipelines through Haifa that supply oil to the British Mediterranean Fleet. It is rumored that the evacuation of British people in Iraq is being prepared. The British troops who landed in Iraq on April 18 have all been deployed inland. This time, the Iraqi government expressed its opposition to the continued arrival of British troops in the country. The British accused the Iraqi government of violating the Anglo-Iraqi Mutual Assistance Treaty, which states that the Iraqi government should provide all kinds of facilities for the landing and transportation of British troops in Iraqi territory.

<h3 id="e14">Iraq's Ultimatum to Britain: Determination to Safeguard Sovereignty <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Beirut: According to the treaty between Iraq and Britain, British troops were allowed to pass through Iraqi territory during wartime. However, after the British troops landed in Basra this time, they remained stationed in Iraq and did not move elsewhere. Despite repeated protests from the Iraqi government, these proved ineffective. Consequently, the Iraqi authorities have taken necessary measures to protect their national rights. On Saturday afternoon, the government notified the public of this matter and mobilized the special forces of the 1916 class and other classes. In the afternoon, three more troop transport ships arrived in Basra. Iraqi authorities prohibited their soldiers from landing and ordered the ship captains to immediately leave Iraqi territorial waters. According to semi-official sources in Baghdad, the Iraqi government has issued a final ultimatum to the British authorities, demanding that the three ships withdraw immediately and that the landed troops leave the country within two weeks. Otherwise, Iraq will use force to achieve this and declare the Iraqi-British treaty invalid. On Saturday night, Iraqi troops had occupied all military key points in the country, including the port of Basra. The oil fields were also placed under military protection. British nationals in Iraq have been relocated to the Habbaniyah airfield occupied by British troops. British Ambassador Cornwallis met with Iraqi Prime Minister Gailani several times on Saturday night and also received the Iraqi government's ultimatum. It is reported that the Iraqi Prime Minister told the British Ambassador that Iraq is determined to defend its national rights, even resorting to force if necessary, but this responsibility should be borne by Britain because Britain has already violated the treaty between the two countries.

<p>London: This morning, changes in government personnel were announced. Aircraft Production Minister Lord Beaverbrook has been appointed as Minister of State. His former position will be filled by Transport Minister Sir John Reith. The Aviation Minister, Captain Austin Hudson, has been appointed as Dominions Under-Secretary. The two departments of Aviation and Transport will be merged into one, and Mr. Leathers, the former coal advisor for the Ministry of Shipping, will be the minister of the new department. Some responsibilities of the Ministry of Transport that are not closely related to transportation will be transferred to the Board of Trade or other departments. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Political figures recently stated that the changes in the British Cabinet have made Lord Beaverbrook an important assistant to the Prime Minister. Mr. Beaverbrook will now concentrate his efforts to assist Churchill. Mr. Beaverbrook's promotion and the establishment of the Ministry of War Transport indicate that British Prime Minister Churchill is determined, during the most critical period of the war, to devote every ounce of energy to the British war front. This cabinet change clearly aims to meet the demands of Parliament and the press for the establishment of a small war cabinet. The members of this war cabinet include Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Privy Seal Clement Attlee, Minister without Portfolio Arthur Greenwood, and Home Secretary Herbert Morrison. Informed sources also recognize Lord Beaverbrook as the "officer in command of the home front." (2nd Associated Press)</p>

<p>Moscow: Marshal Timoshenko, People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union, recently issued the following proclamation: "Today, the people of our motherland unanimously celebrate this May Day of labor, inspecting revolutionary forces. The great Soviet people are greeting this commemorative day with new socialist victories. Under the encouragement of the resolutions of the 18th Party Congress, the Soviet people continue to advance and have achieved great success in implementing the 1941 economic plan. The Red Army is the shield of the Soviet people's peaceful labor and also the guarantor of the victory of the October Revolution. The experience gained in recent years has further enhanced its strength. The Red Army is determined to inflict a devastating blow on anyone who dares to infringe upon the interests of the Soviet people and the socialist state. Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Belarus, and Northern Bukovina are celebrating Labor Day freely and joyfully for the first time this year. In the past year, these new Soviet republics have achieved great success. Currently, there are no landlords or capitalists in the new republics, and the working masses have established a new life. On the other hand, non-Soviet people are spending their Labor Day in a different environment. The Second Imperialist War has now spread to almost all capitalist countries and is evolving into a world war. The wars currently being waged in Europe, Asia, and Africa are being supported by resources from North and South America. War is being waged on land, sea, and air, causing great suffering and losses to the working masses. Our great motherland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, stands firm like a rock in a sea of storms. The Soviet people are benefiting from the wise diplomatic policies of Stalin, which have kept them out of the war. The Soviet government, in order to maintain friendly relations with its neighbors and other countries, recently signed a neutrality pact with Japan. This agreement is an important step in improving relations with Japan, and its political significance is self-evident. However, the achievements we have made in international policy and strengthening national defense do not mean that we can rest. The current international situation contains all kinds of alarming events. In this situation, the Red Army must be prepared for any eventuality and remain in a state of readiness, so that the enemy's 'accidents' and plots cannot succeed. (Stalin's words) The Soviet government, the Bolshevik Party, and Comrade Stalin have given us an important task, which is to reform the Red Army's training system in accordance with modern warfare experience. We should strive in this area so that the Red Army can repel any enemy at any time. Do not be complacent, do not be slack, and use modern warfare experience to further perfect our military knowledge. This is our daily instruction. The Soviet people have given the Red Army first-class technology. Our task is to advance in military science. At the same time, whether in practice or training, everything must closely resemble war. Red Army personnel, political personnel, and comrades, you should continue to improve military training, strengthen unified command and Soviet military discipline, and be ready at all times to defend the motherland. On this great commemorative day, I extend my congratulations to everyone and firmly believe that you will complete the tasks given to you by the government and Stalin." (2nd TASS)</p>
<p>Red Square: Grand Parade</p>
<p>Moscow: Yesterday, the sixteen Soviet republics enthusiastically celebrated May Day of Labor. The situation in Moscow was particularly active. Demonstrators gathered in the streets early in the morning, and music and bells rang out. Led by music bands, the demonstrators marched towards Red Square. Before one o'clock, Red Square was crowded with people, including members of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, members of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, Soviet heroes, writers, artists, and so on. In addition, representatives from the new Soviet republics participated for the first time. Special seats were occupied by the diplomatic corps and journalists. The Red Army troops were lined up in Red Square, a magnificent sight. At noon, leaders such as Stalin, Molotov, and Voroshilov ascended the podium, and the crowd greeted them with enthusiastic cheers. Then, Marshal Timoshenko, People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union, rode out of the Kremlin and first listened to the report of the parade commander, Comrade Tyulenev, and then inspected the troops. Amid thunderous cheers, he took the stage to deliver a speech. At this point, the grand parade began. Leading the way were military school students, followed by a company of naval personnel, whose orderly steps were well-received. Members of the Soviet Defense Aviation and Chemical Society, including veteran Red Army soldiers, also participated in the parade. The infantry squads all carried new-style automatic rifles, leaving a deep impression on the viewers. This parade fully demonstrated the Red Army's great mechanized weapons. Motorcycles with machine guns and armored vehicles sped across Red Square. The variety of anti-aircraft weapons, such as anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, was particularly noticeable. In addition, there were countless long-range cannons and tank-destroying guns. Following the artillery units were tank units, including new-style "land destroyers" and tank fortresses. At the same time, aircraft soared through the skies above Red Square. Some aircraft dove straight down at high speed, causing gasps of amazement. Bringing up the rear were the people's demonstration teams, who passed the command platform, winding endlessly for several hours, a magnificent sight. As they passed the reviewing stand, they unanimously cheered Stalin and his comrades. They also shouted slogans, supporting the Soviet government's peaceful foreign policy and expressing their determination to consolidate national defense and strengthen the Red Army. Many of the demonstrators were athletes and young people who had experienced hardship. In their slogans, they further demanded that the Soviet Union further develop its agricultural, cultural, and economic sectors. This great demonstration showed the Soviet people's loyalty and support for their beloved leader, Stalin. The demonstration involved two million people and lasted for five hours. (2nd TASS)</p>

<p>London: A Free French News Agency correspondent stationed in Istanbul reports that Turkey's defense arrangements have been greatly modified due to the occupation of some Aegean islands by German forces. Turkey's attention is now focused on the Smyrna region. It is believed that President Inönü will personally inspect the area to observe Germany's intentions. It seems that Germany intends to contact the Italian forces on the Dodecanese Islands in order to isolate Turkey and extend the influence of the Axis powers into Syria, while also avoiding the need for difficult military operations against Turkey. Germany's avoidance of the Dardanelles may avoid provoking the Soviet Union and will continue to benefit from Soviet economic assistance. The correspondent also believes that a large part of the German merchant fleet in the Black Sea, including eight large ships, will soon sail to the Aegean Sea to maintain supplies to the occupied islands.

<p>London: The celebration of Labor Day in most European countries has been greatly reduced due to the impact of the war. However, the Soviet Union is still celebrating for three days. A prominent feature of the Soviet celebration is the slogans praising Stalin's foreign policy, which they say contains international peace and domestic security.

<p>Moscow: The Soviet Union concentrated dozens of squadrons of aircraft, cannons, and tanks here yesterday in preparation for today's annual May Day performance.

Recently, the "Red Army News" published a commentary stating, "The international situation is extremely complex and changes rapidly, but no matter how dangerous the storms around us, our country's ship will continue to follow its course." Also, former Finnish Communist leader Antti Kainen wrote in "Pravda" that "Capitalist countries, national hatred, patriotism, and militaristic thinking are spreading beyond our borders."

<p>London: Today, the Finnish Embassy here issued an official statement confirming the news of German troops arriving in Finland, but said that the reported number of 12,000 was an exaggeration.

<p>Washington: The Finnish Consul General in the United States declared that rumors of 11,000 German troops landing in Finland are untrue. Only 1,300 German soldiers have arrived in Finland, and they are all unarmed. There is nothing wrong with the transit agreement signed between Germany and Finland last year. (1st Coastal Telegraph)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that London has no knowledge of reports that German troop transport ships have landed German troops at the port of Turku (Abo) in southwestern Finland. However, Germany may have an agreement with the Finnish government allowing German troops to transit through Finland to Petsamo and northern Norway. The British government considered this agreement unfortunate and made strong representations to the Finnish government. The agreement also allows German soldiers on leave in Germany to return to their units in northern Norway via Finland. In recent months, perhaps due to bad weather, ice, and snow in northern Finland, Norway, and the Gulf of Bothnia, many German soldiers on leave have been unable to return north to their units. Now that spring has arrived and the weather has improved, the movement of German soldiers on leave may have intensified, so there may continue to be news of German troops passing through Finland in the coming weeks. It is believed that the Finnish-German agreement allows "workers" and German soldiers on leave to transit through Finland. (1st Reuters)</p>

<p>London: The news that British troops have completed their retreat from Greece has been confirmed here. According to estimates by responsible experts, the number of troops withdrawn is between 41,000 and 45,000. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Official sources in Cairo recently announced that eight out of ten of the British Empire troops originally in Greece have been safely evacuated. Yesterday, Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons that at least three-quarters of the British troops in Greece had withdrawn, with heavy equipment being abandoned. Up until the time of the inevitable withdrawal, the British had dispatched about 60,000 troops to land in Greece, including one division each from New Zealand and Australia. At least 45,000 of them have been evacuated (cheers). The British Air Force was forced to leave its airfields in Greece due to enemy superiority, leaving only a small number of aircraft to cover the British troops boarding ships. From this point of view, the successful withdrawal of the majority of British troops must be regarded as an outstanding achievement. The British troops fought and retreated, and their achievement in reaching the coast after a long journey should be highly praised, especially the rearguard units. German aircraft bombed continuously every day, but failed to break the discipline and order of the British troops on the march. In addition to being attacked from the air, the British troops were also pursued by three German armored divisions and the entire mechanized army. The British troops suffered about 2,000 casualties in several major battles around Mount Olympus, Grevena, and the Tempe Pass. This is negligible compared to the losses suffered by the German troops. The German troops, with five times the strength, were repeatedly blocked and stopped by the British troops. There was a stalemate for two days at one point. The German troops also suffered considerable losses when attacking the Greek and ANZAC troops. I dare to say that I will be able to give a more detailed report during the debate next week.

<p>Tokyo: The Japan Times and Hirochishinbun both attempted yesterday to formulate possible conditions for peace in the European war. However, they admitted that they were unaware of the key points of the Axis powers' solution. The preamble stated that the current European situation seems to be at a turning point in the European war, and the general public has begun to wonder if it cannot end here and now. The following conditions for peace are then proposed: The first principle is that the greatest opportunity for the development and disposition of the world, such as spheres of influence, resources, and political systems, should be enjoyed by the stronger countries. Detailed requirements that are possible according to this principle must be considered before they can be considered. The power to resolve peaceful trends should be wielded by the following countries: Germany (with Italy as a second-tier partner), Japan, Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Military factors must first be explored in a broad sense. Britain and the United States should declare a "naval holiday" on the high seas. The Axis powers will do the same when they reach a considerable ratio. Malta in the eastern Mediterranean and the Aden fortress in the Red Sea will be dismantled and become demilitarized zones. The same applies to Singapore, Hong Kong, and the United States' bases in the Pacific, as well as any plans for the Aleutian Islands (North America West) opposite Japan. British naval forces in the Mediterranean will be completely withdrawn. The Axis powers will demand that the Suez Canal be jointly managed and defended by Britain and the Axis powers. All of North Africa, from Gibraltar to Somaliland, will be disposed of by the Axis powers. The Axis powers may allow France to retain its colonies under certain common conditions. Some British colonies and other African colonies on the east and west coasts will be administered by Germany and Italy. The Union of South Africa may secede from its mother country and become completely independent. All commercial preferential tariffs should be abolished. The entire European continent will form a federation, with all states under German control. All political cooperation will be based in Berlin. Britain will remain the center of the British Empire, but the people of the Empire may gradually recognize the need to transfer various powers to Canada, so that it can be more secure and become an overseas base. Where Germany's power will end in the southeast is a question. Unless the Sea of Marmara is handed over to Turkey and the Soviet Union for joint management, Germany may take the sea as its border. The oil wells of Iraq and Iran are subject to equal access by all countries, and a joint ownership system should be established by the current investors, representatives of the sovereign states, and Germany. This is an inevitable requirement. The United States will take Canada, Central America, South America, Newfoundland, Greenland, and the surrounding islands as its sphere of influence, but the United States will be responsible for not dominating South America in a way that hinders the Axis powers. Germany and its allies must be allowed to enjoy full freedom and equal opportunities on the continent. The United States must not establish naval bases west of Hawaii, and even reducing the importance of fortresses may be a condition. As for the entire Pacific, the Dutch East Indies may have to secede and be governed by an independent government. Indigenous people have equal political rights. The territories of the British Isles and peninsulas will increase their autonomy. All islands in the Pacific will hire Japanese advisers and entrust them with the responsibility of making the cooperation method in this co-prosperity sphere a reality. In particular, to preserve the natural resources needed in the Pacific region, French Indochina will also be allowed to become independent as part of the overall plan for concord politics in the West Pacific region. The Soviet Union may have to abolish its military defenses in Siberia and eliminate the threat from Vladivostok to reassure Japan and as a gesture of trust. Japan will reduce its garrison in Manchuria or Mongolia to the number needed to protect the safety of Japan's sphere of influence in return. Australia will abolish the discriminatory immigration system and allow Japanese people to have equal residency rights. The future of India will be the establishment of an autonomous government under a plan that improves the legal system of the British government and is co-desired by the indigenous people.

<h3 id="e51">Grain: Buying A Sheng Of Rice Will Cost $1.56, How Will The Masses Survive? This Is A Heinous And Conscientious Act By Rice Merchants. Let Us See How Far This Horizontal Inflation And Vertical Price Hike Will Go. Fortunately, The Shanghai Municipal Council's Fixed Rice And Saigon Rice Are About To Arrive. <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The price of foreign rice is rising more and more fiercely, the selling price is almost rising every day, every hour, and every moment. The greed of the hoarders has not yet ended, and the lives of 85% of food households are in despair. The rise is out of control. The day before yesterday (May 1), all foreign rice rose sharply. No. 1 Saigon arrived at $154, No. 2 reached $148, Yinghua Division (one stone and two dou and a half), No. 1 reached $174, and original package broken rice also reached $140.05, which is $3, $5, or $6 more than the closing price on April 30. Moreover, rumors abounded to cheer on the hoarders, and the market was almost created into a terrifying situation of rising prices all the way. Yesterday, the market area was divided into three parts: one is the place where merchants and shops buy, one is the place where original vendors sell, and in the middle of the two parts is the place where brokers mediate. In this way, original vendors can only sell to rice distributors, and rice distributors can only sell to shops. All transactions must be registered in a book by the broker at the registration office, such as which customer sells to which line, which line sells to which shop, each is clearly distinguished. In this way, in addition to actual sales, it seems that there is no possibility of confusion. However, it is not yet certain whether it can be brought into the right track. At the same time, members of the Broker Association enter the arena in batches, alternating every other day, in order to reduce unnecessary buying. The business hours are stipulated from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. The market was closed yesterday under this regulation. Since the market opened at 10:00 a.m., shop customers were already extremely crowded, and they were competing with each other to apply to rice distributors, and the rice distributors purchased from original vendors. For a time, the sales market was lively, and the selling voices rose one after another. If the foreign rice increased by one yuan from the initial opening, No. 1 Saigon opened at $155, and small pressed opened at $146.5. Afterwards, the buying interest became more and more旺盛，市面再接再厲，接續上升，　收盤各色洋米行情較前繼漲二元左右，計一號西貢爲百五　十元，二號百五十一二元，敏黨百五十一二元，三號還羅百五十六元，小絞百四十八元，東京砶尖百四十元左右，碎尖百廿二三元，</p>
<p>The arrival of thick and thin粳 and glutinous rice is still declining, and the sales in shops are even more旺盛，蓋以價盤自　米一再飛漲後，兩者相較殊覺低廉，門市轉暢，店舖爲謀應需計，一般作客遂各注意於此，競購不已，一時有供不敷求之概，行情亦突飛猛漲五元之砠，計開錫粳百六十一元，蘇　粳百六十元至百五十八元，南港早晚稻百五十五元半，百五十四元，原包百六十一元百六十元，至於香港百元開百四十二元至百四十元，糯菉百三十元百廿七八元，</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship arrived in port one day, carrying 15,116 bags of foreign rice and 1,594 bags of corn from Hong Kong. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,819 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. Both ships were stopped at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The French Company's Kaiding ship transported a large amount of foreign rice from Saigon, which entered the port yesterday evening. The amount of rice can be confirmed and reported later today.

<h3 id="e52">Kan Flour Opens At $35, The Flat-Selling Flour Is Changed To $29 <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Flour: The current foreign flour market situation, since the Hua factory flat-selling flour was changed to a wholesale price of $29 from May 1, and then followed by the rising prices of rice, oil, and various miscellaneous grains, everyone's heart is upward. Speculators and hoarders, using rumors of currency system changes as an excuse, greatly raised prices, causing the market to rise sharply. The day before yesterday, Jinlong brand Kan flour once reached $35, which was an unprecedented record. Yesterday morning, the market opened, and the buying interest was still strong. Jinlong flour opened at $34.2 to $2.5 jiao. Then, due to profit-taking by hoarders midway, the market fell slightly, and the price returned to $34.1 and $34.

<p>Wheat: Wheat is extremely tight. Because the price of flour has soared, sellers are more and more reluctant to sell. It is reported that the price of high-gluten wheat in the concession warehouse must be $51 or $2. The factory door-to-door price has also been released to $47 or $8, but there is still no spot available for collection. The market is still stagnant.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the yellow bean market was under the violent rise of oil cake, which caused hoarders to absorb them. Therefore, the Guīdé bean market price has opened to the highest price of $48, and 1,400 to 500 bags were traded (others were not announced). Corn sales are good in Zhejiang because there is Lianyungang, so people's hearts have turned for the better, and the market price has risen steadily.

<p>The bean cake market, because of the violent rise the day before yesterday (1st) (the side oil soared by 8 or 9 yuan, and the bean cake soared by about 2 yuan), caused speculators to see that there was already a thick profit to be made, which aroused the desire to close out, so they took the opportunity to come out, and business was lively. Shēngjì cake market price was shouted lower and lower (the cake factory is nearby, and the factory also has chips to release), so speculators thought that the good result was about one yuan lower than the market the previous day (1st). Although other cakes were affected, the overall situation was stable. A total of more than 20,000 pieces of Shēngjì cake were traded, and the price details are in the market price column, 1,000 pieces of green character cake, 5 vehicles of fat character cake, and 2 vehicles of Yuanlong cake. After the bean oil soared the day before yesterday, it was calm yesterday. In short, the value is too high, the sales market is also small, so if there is no speculation, the trend should be slightly frustrated. Yesterday, Dalian oil was still one day's original plate, the price was 186 yuan, and 200 barrels were traded. 200 dan of Dayou factory oil, the price was 134 yuan old warehouse receipt.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed exchange rates unchanged.  The black market for British exchange rates was steady but slightly looser.  The US dollar seemed more active and slightly tightened. After opening in the morning, it softened slightly due to outflows from Dao Heng Bank and Hong Kong Electric. However, the Bank of England and HSBC suddenly absorbed funds, bringing the US dollar back to its initial level of $5.15625.  It softened again to $5.125.  At noon, some brokers and importers made small purchases, while American merchants and other institutions offered to sell, halting the tightening and returning the rate to its initial level. In the afternoon, speculators suddenly came in to hedge, with the Bank of England and HSBC showing strong absorption capacity.  The US dollar softened to close at $5.115, tightening to $0.03125. The British exchange rate, due to outflows from Hong Kong Electric, trended flat at 3 pence and 1875. Forward British exchange rates were loose, while US exchange rates were flat, indicating a reduced confidence in the British exchange rate. Trading was quite active.</p>

<p>The yarn market, which turned lower in the afternoon of the previous day, rose again yesterday, with the upward trend still strong. This was because demand from Hong Kong merchants remained strong. Speculators believed that the number of Double Horse chips would be reduced, and the old story of labor reduction due to electricity conservation was brought up again. As a result, they uniformly bought up factory orders, engaging in manipulation. The market gradually rose. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn yesterday was $1,577, and the low price was $1,548. The initial transaction price in the afternoon was $1,568, which later rose to $1,576. There was profit-taking in the middle, and prices loosened to $1,565, but short covering was good, and the final price was $1,574.5. Double Horse yarn has risen from a low of $1,479 last Friday (the 25th of last month) to a high of $1,577 yesterday, rising for a week and climbing close to $100. Cotton yarn was also not limited to exports for the past two days.</p>
<p>The opening situation for Double Horse in the morning showed that prices had turned weak compared to the evening of the previous day, and market sentiment was mixed. The initial price was $1,550, falling slightly to $48 shortly thereafter. At this time, buying pressure rose sharply, with only buyers and few sellers. In an instant, prices rose to $1,561, but some speculative buyers exited, and standard gold remained flat. The market stabilized for a long time. It was then heard that the trading of Guangbang coarse yarn was not bad, and miscellaneous brand yarns were also relatively firm. Prices tightened suddenly, with more buyers than sellers, rising directly to $1,577. Those who profited in the middle exited, falling back to $1,568 at closing. The trading volume for half a day was statistically 12,150 bales. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>

<p>The current cotton situation turned for the better following the yarn market, but the excitement was not as strong as the firmness of the yarn market. The actual situation was different, because cotton yarn had both long and short positions, and changed rapidly. However, although factory demand was not strong, sentiment improved. The transaction market prices for spot cotton on the 1st and 2nd are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Pengjia Slope 331 Yongan 600 pieces Delivered to factory</p>

<p>Another report: Foreign cotton trading by foreign firms in Shanghai continued to rise firmly due to high sentiment and enthusiastic buying. Considering the lack of shipping costs from overseas procurement, and at the same time, the prosperous situation of spot yarn in the city, factory and counterparts purchases have been very enthusiastic in recent days. In addition to Indian and Brazilian cotton, there were also small amounts of California and Egyptian cotton transactions yesterday. The Xinnuo Yarn Factory has purchased a large quantity of Argentine cotton, with a market price of around 300 yuan.</p>
<p>A large batch of American cotton arrived in Shanghai. The American liner "City of Alam", managed by Wallen Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai from Santos, Brazil, South America, with a large batch of 16,010 pieces of cotton on the previous day (the 1st). It docked at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to unload.</p>
<p>New York cotton cloth rose firmly due to purchases by counterparts and short covering. Closing prices rose by one to twelve points compared to the previous day. Prices rose fourteen to one point above the previous day (the 2nd).</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market rose initially due to buyer covering, and then fell slightly due to selling by various parties, profit-taking by longs, and the impact of the international situation. As a result, closing prices rose by about two rupees. Forecasts predict that today's closing market will be half a rupee higher.</p>

<p>According to a statement issued by the Public Works Department, the Bureau is currently in the final stages of negotiations with the Hong Kong Government and will soon have 5,000 tons of Aung San small grain rice shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai for sale. This can be done in conjunction with shipping 20,000 to 25,000 tons of rice to Shanghai per month for adjustment purposes. Regarding Hong Kong rice export licenses, except for orders that have already obtained this certificate and that the order does not exceed 2,900 tons, the Hong Kong Government will not issue licenses to ship rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai other than those issued to the Bureau.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Rice Prices Have Been Determined The Bureau has previously stated that it has decided to sell the rice shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai to the public at a reasonable price, and that it does not intend to interfere with the normal rice industry unless necessary, hoping that wholesale and retail rice merchants will cooperate in the distribution of the above-mentioned rice. Regarding the above-mentioned 5,000 tons of grain in the first batch, the Bureau is currently preparing to handle customer order registration procedures. Relevant wholesale and retail rice merchants can contact the Likee Foreign Firm at 210 Sichuan Road for details on prices and distribution conditions. The tentative maximum retail price for the first batch of rice is $110 per picul.</p>
<p>French Concession Takes the Same Approach The French Concession Municipal Council issued a public notice yesterday morning stating that the French Concession authorities have also taken the same approach as the Public Concession Public Works Department, purchasing foreign rice from Vietnam. The first batch will arrive in Shanghai within the next week and will be directly distributed to various retail rice shops for sale to suppress rice prices in the Shanghai market. According to key officials of the French Concession, the authorities' implementation of this direct purchase and transportation method is the only effective solution to eliminate rice smugglers and unscrupulous merchants, and Shanghai's current unstable situation will also be improved. It is reported that the bread and bun industry association in this city has first requested the Public Works Department to allocate more than 400 piculs of Hong Kong rice per month to benefit the industry.</p>
<p>Companies and Businesses Should Quickly Place Orders The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that the French Concession authorities disclosed this morning (the 2nd) that they have now adopted the same method of shipping rice to the city as announced by the Public Works Department yesterday (the 1st). Rice merchants manipulating the rice market have now adopted a defensive posture. Rice for the Public Concession will be shipped from Hong Kong in mid-month, and the French Concession authorities stated that large quantities of rice will be shipped from Vietnam to Shanghai starting next week. It is estimated that Shanghai's major rice merchants are currently hoarding about 1.6 million bags of rice to manipulate the market, causing rice prices to skyrocket. However, the new actions taken by the two bureaus today are expected to prevent manipulators from using their skills. Well-informed sources claimed this morning that the situation could be greatly improved if businesses here, especially public utility companies, were to support the new plan of the Public Concession authorities. Because the public utility companies purchase rice from the Public Works Department on behalf of their employees, the benefits are significant. The resulting impact will cause rice prices to fall. At the same time, the various chambers of commerce in this city should cooperate to ensure the smooth sale of the rice that is shipped in.</p>
<p>Rice Market Forced to Automatically Rectify The Rice Market Management Committee convened its 81st committee meeting the day before yesterday, and unanimously advocated revitalizing the rice market's trading regulations. After deliberation, it was decided to take emergency measures and shorten the market's operating hours. It has been implemented since yesterday. A verification point was set up at the market entrance to check the market access permits of the firms and customers. Monitoring and impartial offices were set up in the market, and the market was divided into north and south sides, namely the buying and selling parties. The area in the market was about three to five feet wide for rice brokers and monitors to stand. The "impartial office" was set up on the stage at the west end of the market. After a rice transaction was officially completed under monitoring, the broker had to take the transaction order around to the impartial office to request a stamp before it could be considered an official transaction, otherwise it would be considered an illegal transaction. Subsequently, any disputes that arise will be refused arbitration.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rise Again Rectification Ineffective</p>
<p>It also stipulates: (1) Brokers are only allowed to sell to counterparts operating in the market for intermediary business on behalf of customers. (2) Re-sellers are only allowed to sell to rice distributors operating in the market for intermediary business on behalf of customers. (3) Rice purchased by rice shops should be purchased from rice distributors operating in the market, and a transaction order must be issued at the time of transaction. After implementing the above-mentioned measures yesterday, the market opened at 10:30, and it was initially quiet. However, in a short time, rumors spread again that Hong Kong had banned rice exports, and prices rose sharply, with the highest price exceeding the $160 per picul mark. On the broker side, the number of people entering the market has been reduced to 30 per day since yesterday to avoid criticism from foreign parties.</p>
<p>Rice Ships Chartered According to yesterday's news, the Public Works Department Public Warehouse Management Committee has chartered two ships, one named "Gran" and one named "North Trader." The former sailed south a few days ago and will load about 2,500 tons of rice from Yangon next month to ship to Shanghai. The latter is already in Yangon and will load about 4,000 tons of white rice to ship to Shanghai at the end of May. Also</p>
<p>Flour Arrives The Loganbell ship, registered in the United States, arrived yesterday, carrying 400,000 bags of American flour. Another ship, the American Star, also registered in the United States, will ship 250,000 bags of flour from the United States to Shanghai at the beginning of next week. It is reported that the ship set sail from Seattle at the beginning of last month.</p>

<h3 id="e65">US Export Permit Measures Affect Industry <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department's Industrial and Social Affairs April report last month, although the yarn industry was active because the coastal ports of Zhejiang were closed, this was because of the strong demand for cotton products in the interior. At the same time, speculators are again engaged in purchases. The price of high-quality cotton yarn has risen due to the possibility of the source of Egyptian cotton being blocked. The work of several dyeing factories has decreased, and the delivery of goods from cigarette factories has not been busy. Only one-third of the light bulb factories are operating, and business is poor. Only one silk factory is operating, but the work situation of silk weaving factories is the same as that of wool weaving factories. Factories manufacturing enamelware have reduced their output by one-third. Machine factories have difficulty obtaining raw materials such as pig iron, iron sheets, and copper. The Customs has not yet seen how the measures to manage the transportation of certain goods from this city to the southern market will affect the situation, but the US regulations on export permits have caused difficulties for several industries.</p>

<p>Shanghai Tongren Fuyuan Hall, the oldest charity in Shanghai, was founded during the reign of Emperor Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty. Located in Meijialong, Qiaojia Bang in the Nanshi district, its charitable activities include providing monthly rations to the poor, orphans, the elderly, and widows, as well as dispensing medicine in the summer, distributing clothing and rice in the winter, and providing burial grounds.</p>
<p>Providing Coffins and Burial Services for the Deceased Found on the Streets, Unclaimed Corpses, and Abandoned Coffins in the Wilderness. A branch hall is established on Ningbo Road in the French Concession to provide coffins and burial services for the deceased found on the streets within the concession. A rescue bureau is set up at the South Wharf, equipped with rescue patrol boats to rescue people who fall into the river and recover drowned bodies. Those without relatives to claim them are also provided with coffins and burial. Their burial grounds are located in Liuliqiao, Beicai in Pudong, and Tangwan Township in Puxi. The expenses for the above-mentioned charitable activities</p>
<p>Amount to Nine Thousand Several Thousand Yuan Annually. After the war, the hall was destroyed, and most of its properties were damaged by fire. Only a few remain, which need to be extensively repaired. The limited rental income is insufficient to cover the costs of repairs. Since last spring, prices have soared, and the hall's charitable expenses have also increased dramatically. It is said that the cost of coffins alone has increased from just four yuan and several jiao per piece before the war to over thirty yuan now. The French Concession and the southern and western parts of Shanghai need an average of about thirty to forty coffins of various sizes daily, costing over one thousand yuan per day, or over twenty thousand yuan per month. Other transportation and burial costs are not included. If this continues, it will be difficult to sustain. It is hoped that benevolent gentlemen from all walks of life will generously contribute to this charitable cause, which will be immeasurably meritorious.</p>

<h3 id="e78">London Stops Listing Shanghai-Hong Kong Marine Insurance Rates Due to Increasing Crisis in the Pacific Trade Circles Pay Close Attention <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>According to reports from Shanghai, the London marine insurance industry, in view of the increasing risks in the Pacific region, has recently stopped publishing marine insurance rates for Shanghai and Hong Kong. This news has attracted considerable attention from trade circles in Shanghai. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the Shanghai Marine Insurance Association at No. 18 Huangpu Tan Road. The person in charge stated that the company</p>
<p>Was unaware of this news.</p>
<p>However, insurance agency firms stated that this news is indeed true. Insurance circles in Shanghai indicated that the reason why the London insurance industry refuses to publish marine insurance rates for Shanghai and Hong Kong is probably because the London insurance industry is paying close attention to the situation in the Far East and wants the marine insurance industry in Shanghai and Hong Kong to freely set prices at what they consider appropriate, without being affected by the prices published by London. It was also stated that war insurance prices are not affected by the new regulations set by London, and local firms will continue to follow the local prices published by London</p>
<p>As a standard.</p>
<p>It is understood that local firms currently charge an average of 1.50 yuan per thousand yuan worth of goods for marine insurance. However, import and export merchants claim that they often pay more than 2.50 yuan per thousand yuan worth of goods, sometimes as much as 6, 7, or 9 yuan, which is said to be due to various surcharges. The war insurance fee published in London is still 5 yuan per thousand yuan worth of goods, which local firms continue to follow. The marine insurance rates in Shanghai are not higher than those published in London, but the trade community fears that the prices of imported goods will rise due to the increase in insurance costs.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Turning Point in Labor Strike <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The labor strike at the Commercial Press had worsened after the management suddenly refused mediation. It is now learned that the Hong Kong authorities have sent Mr. Li Bojia, Assistant Manager, to Shanghai on the Guangdong, and the representatives of the union delegation have sent representatives to make a sincere appeal. An initial formal discussion was held at the General Management Office on Henan Road.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press to Issue Salaries on a Fixed Date</p>
<p>In addition to stating the hardships and reasonable demands of the colleagues, the labor representatives also mentioned the issue of salary payment on the 3rd. They firmly requested Mr. Li to provide a sincere explanation of the attitude of General Manager Wang and the principles for resolving the labor strike, in order to comfort the colleagues. Mr. Li said that he was sent to Shanghai by the General Manager to resolve the labor strike. The factory has decided to issue salaries at the General Management Office on Henan Road on the morning of the 5th of this month. The general branch will issue salaries in the afternoon. As for the various demands, they still need to be decided by the board of directors. Negotiations will be held again in a day or two. If mutual understanding can be reached, there is hope of breaking the deadlock in the labor strike.</p>
<p>The Labor Strike at Fuxin Tobacco Company Resolved</p>
<p>The labor strike at the Fuxin Tobacco Company on Macau Road has lasted for more than ten days due to disagreements over rice subsidies during the work stoppage. It is now learned that the labor strike has been resolved satisfactorily after further negotiations between the two parties. Male workers will receive an increase of 4 to 6 yuan (calculated monthly), while female workers will receive an increase of 3 to 6 li (calculated per pack of cigarettes, the original wage was 9 fen and 7 li 5). In addition to a daily rice subsidy of 2 jiao, 2 dou of white rice will be provided monthly. During the work stoppage, the factory will provide a monthly subsidy of 15 yuan for male workers, in addition to the original subsidy, and 1 dou of white rice for female workers. The labor party is satisfied. Work has resumed as of yesterday.</p>
<p>Labor and Management Reach Agreement at Guoyao</p>
<p>The employees of the Guoyao pharmacy in Shanghai, feeling that life is difficult and their salaries are insufficient to cover their expenses, requested a threefold increase in salary and 5 dou of white rice per month from the management. Fortunately, both labor and management were able to understand each other, and a labor strike was avoided. It is now learned that the conditions proposed by the labor party have been discussed and a decision has been made to increase salaries by 140%, and the rice subsidy will be 70% of the subsidy. It is expected to be implemented starting this month.</p>

Those who pass the written examination will be scheduled for a bicycle test and an oral examination.</p>

<p>After the government trade authorities designated the four categories of native products—tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals—to assess production, sales, and international market prices and then統籌purchase and sell them at preferential prices, the Trade Commission, China Tea Company, Fuxing Company, and Resources Commission were ordered to統籌purchase and sell them and export them to the Soviet Union and other countries via the Sino-Soviet Highway, the Burma Road, and Hong Kong. Because these four types of native products are related to barter trade and debt repayment, the export quantities and values for the first quarter of this year are recorded below: (1) Tung oil: 81,995 quintals, 23,864,577 yuan, compared to 50,210 quintals and 7,38,724 yuan in the same quarter last year.

The committee has not yet scheduled a meeting date, but it is believed that a meeting will be held soon.</p>
<p>The Company States That Expenses Have Increased Sharply</p>
<p>At the annual shareholders' meeting of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, Chairman Meige explained to the shareholders that the company's income is insufficient to meet the daily increasing expenses or replace new vehicles. Last year, the company's difficulties were not only due to sharply increased expenses, but also due to the loss of 203,000 yuan in income due to labor strikes. At times, the public buses were prohibited from driving on the roads outside the Shanghai western boundaries. As for the workers' strike, there was no reason for it. The company's policy is to maintain wages at a level sufficient to cover living expenses and to do its best to improve the general labor conditions as the economic situation permits. Meige stated at the end that last year the company added two new public buses, and the bodies of 18 new buses purchased the year before had been assembled. In addition, six smaller public buses were retired last year.</p>

<p>— Pan Li</p>
<p>After Germany launched a large-scale war in Europe, sociologists predicted that the European continent would face an unprecedented great famine. Not long ago, the famous French scientist Carrel returned to Europe from the United States to investigate the extent of the famine in the occupied areas of France, hoping to use scientific methods to ensure that the people get adequate nutrition. It can be seen that the food problem in Europe is serious.</p>
<p>The famines and food robbing cases that we see before us make the people's food problem self-evident.</p>
<p>At present, the richest region is often considered to be the Americas in the Western Hemisphere. But strangely, the people's food in the United States is also said to be problematic. Four years ago, in his second inaugural address, US President Roosevelt mentioned that "one-third of the nation is undernourished." According to recent surveys, this is not an exaggeration. In the United States, four out of ten families do not have enough to eat. Based on this estimate, 13 million families in the so-called Golden State of the United States do not have enough to eat. The food situation in other countries can also be imagined.</p>
<p>Those who are struggling on the verge of starvation should understand that these phenomena are man-made. Only with human efforts can these phenomena be corrected.</p>

<h3 id="e90">After Marriage <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Hong</p>
<p>After marriage, although my work is still almost the same as before, my life has undergone great changes.</p>
<p>In the early morning, waking up from a dream, I reach for the watch beside my pillow, and force open my tight eyes. Seeing that it's only half-past six, I still have enough time to finish my morning routine and prepare breakfast in the kitchen. I can no longer bury myself in bed like when I lived at school, sitting up and lying down, lying down and sitting up, waiting for the congee to arrive before "officially" getting up. Now? It's like escaping a disaster. It's okay when the weather is clear, I just swallow the congee and leave. If it rains, it's terrible. Wearing galoshes, carrying an umbrella, and holding a bundle of cotton shoes, I drape a bulky coat over myself and rush to the tram stop on the muddy road, often feeling a pain in my appendix.</p>
<p>Every morning when I leave home, "he" still asks me sleepily, "What time is it?" At this time, I often feel jealous of him, and also envy him, for being able to sleep longer than me; and his office is close by, so he doesn't have to take the tram. I really resent him for being so selfish and not finding a place closer to my school. Thinking of this, I don't bother to pay attention to him. But he doesn't hate me, and he'll lean up and say gently, "Did you take your tram fare? Be sure to take your gloves, it's awfully cold outside." Then, I feel like I need to repent, and I run over and shake his hand, feeling that true love should never be about jealousy and selfishness. Although I have to work harder, his comfort can make me feel comforted, and this comfort can encourage my hard work even more.</p>
<p>Walking on the quiet street, the cold morning wind hits my face, but it doesn't bring any hint of early spring. The saliva I swallow contains some coagulated mud. Vegetable vendors rush to the market in groups, their hurried steps like a quickly composed piece of music. The boatmen on the Suzhou Creek float in a dreamlike dense fog. The tall buildings on both banks also seem to be draped in a layer of blue gauze. The shadow of the sun is still buried in the hazy clouds. Ah! It's truly a beautiful picture of the morning dawn!</p>
<p>Stepping onto the tram, I breathe a sigh of relief. It's not until I enter the school and hear the children singing the morning assembly song that the lead weight in my heart is lifted. "Class begins," "Class dismissed," from half-past eight to four in the afternoon, except for lunch and a few minutes of break, there's no time to rest. In this busyness, I don't have time to think about my troubles, and I forget the stern face of my father-in-law and the icy tone of my mother-in-law.</p>
<p>After dinner, I finish grading papers, take the familiar tram, and walk the familiar road... My legs are weak, my brain is heavy, and my throat is hoarse, aching with every breath. I am like a defeated soldier on the battlefield, so tired and exhausted. As my heavy steps repeat themselves as I drag myself onto the Tianhou Temple Bridge, the beautiful night scene of the Suzhou Creek immediately appears before me, making my heart feel refreshed. The lights in the tall buildings, like twinkling stars, shine in contrast, reflecting onto the undulating water, turning into pieces of silver shields, so many, so lovely, shining like pearls, diamonds, no, even like countless eyes; innocent and pure eyes, children sitting quietly in their seats listening to the teacher's lecture.... Oh! These eyes are so bright and radiant, full of infinite hope; infinite will, infinite future.... They are waiting for us to cultivate, to train, they need us to irrigate, and our hard work will be for them!</p>
<p>As I think and walk, I eagerly look forward to getting home soon, as "home" can let me rest.</p>
<p>He always arrives home one step ahead of me every day. As soon as I enter the door, I can see the back of him sitting at his desk, either writing or reading. Since I objected, I haven't seen him smoking or drinking to relax anymore. The room has been cleaned, but the cleaning is not as thorough as if I had done it myself. After washing clothes and socks, I still have to mend them. Sometimes he plays the piano, and I hum some tunes along. But, my hoarse voice makes me not want to sing anymore. Everyone pities me, that my former singing voice was lost from the time I got married. Every night I always have twelve points of confidence, hoping to recover soon, and praying silently to God.</p>
<p>Before going to bed, I follow the routine of going to my in-laws to greet them. They sit around a table, laughing and chattering. As soon as they see me, my father-in-law puts on a stern face and turns his body away. My mother-in-law, on the other hand, gives me a cold glance, habitually saying, "Just got back?" I can only go through the motions for a while before retreating. Alas! They are not my parents, they will not love me like my parents do, they do not like their son, and they treat me this way as well. They don't approve of me going out to work, and they're even more unhappy that their son allows me to be away from home all day, not adhering to the three obediences and four virtues. They want to bind me, to obey their orders, to be a slave to their family!</p>
<p>Back in the room, I don't make a sound, and I can't make a sound. Finally, he understands me, puts down his work, runs to my side, wipes away my tears and says earnestly, "Hong! Don't be sad, this family isn't us, our lives are just beginning. Please be patient with everything. In two more years, when I have developed a little, then we can break away from this cage and create a new environment, living freely and happily. Just endure the current pain!" His sincere tone stirs up my perseverance, I believe him, I look forward to him, I really hope there will be such a day.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(7) Draw a Cross on Your Face</p>
<p>In reality, the more Yuan Baofan understood, the more uncomfortable he became. Of course, people hate being cuckolds the most!</p>
<p>"Alright, pour a bucket of cold water on him first to wake him up!"</p>
<p>"He's already awake!"</p>
<p>It was true that Qiuhaitang was awake, but he really didn't have the courage to lift his head.</p>
<p>"Hey! Boss Wu, the Marshal has something to ask you!" Ji Zhaoxiong had completely forgotten Qiuhaitang's repeated kindness in helping him. All that remained in his mind was the resentment from the recent two instances where his demands for rice had not been met. He reached out and grabbed Qiuhaitang's long hair, forcefully pulling his head up.</p>
<p>At the same time, Lao Yuan also started speaking.</p>
<p>"Good kid, you're too ungrateful!" His eyes widened like longans, and compared to seven or eight years ago, when he was desperately trying to get Qiuhaitang to perform in Guangde, his demeanor was even more intimidating. It could almost be described as a cloud of murderous intent. "Don't you remember that if it weren't for me, Yuan, supporting you all these years, would you be where you are today? I won't say much else to you now, I'll just ask you, besides your dead daughter, who else is involved in pulling your act?" Qiuhaitang kept his eyes tightly shut, pretending not to hear anything.</p>
<p>"You want to pretend to be deaf? I'll be honest with you, the one inside has already given me a rundown of everything and told it all. This old woman Tian has run into you on Grain and Rice Street before!" Yuan Baofan pointed to an old woman on the left who looked just as cunning as Ji Zhaoxiong.</p>
<p>At the same time, Ji Zhaoxiong's hand suddenly exerted more force, almost pulling out a clump of Qiuhaitang's long hair.</p>
<p>The humiliation inflicted on him by this lackey who relies on his master's power, and Yuan Baofan's words that "the one inside has already given me a rundown of everything and told it all" immediately combined into an extremely potent stimulant, turning Qiuhaitang's original shame and fear into an uncontrollable rage.

<h3 id="e93">Omnipotent Gun for Resisting Paratroopers <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>The U.S. military often uses a new type of omnipotent gun to resist enemy paratroopers invading the airport. It can fire tear gas, smoke bombs, parachute-destroying fireballs, and one-pound high-explosive bombs. Ammunition is placed in twelve round holes and can be installed in three seconds. Each omnipotent gun weighs only 40 pounds. Recently, New Pinna Airport tested this omnipotent gun. The results were very good. It is said that only a few of these new weapons need to be equipped to resist the paratrooper attack.</p>

<h3 id="e95">What I Heard About the Shanghai Conservatory of Music <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Ge Naifeng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Conservatory of Music on Avenue Joffre has recently received an order from the Ministry of Education to reorganize into a private music college. Preparations are now underway, and to raise funds, a concert will be held by the professors on the 5th and 6th.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Conservatory of Music was established in 1937. At that time, the pianist Mr. Ding Shande returned south from the National Women's Normal College in Beiping. Because he saw that besides the National Conservatory of Music, there were few other schools in the country that trained specialized music talents, he decided to establish the private Shanghai Conservatory of Music to take on the responsibility of music education.</p>
<p>When learning any subject, the stronger the foundation, the better your future will be. This is especially true for learning music. If you're careless about breathing techniques when learning to sing, your voice will never improve. If you're careless about fingering and posture when learning piano or violin, you can forget about making any progress. The Shanghai Conservatory of Music has always emphasized strict teaching and never compromises with students. As a result, many young students who understand the art of music have applied, with the number of students around one hundred, recently to the point where they can't even accept any more.</p>
<p>The conservatory has more than ten professors, all of whom are well-known musicians. Piano professor Ding Shande was a top student of Tchaikovsky and graduated from the National Conservatory of Music early. His performances have been well-received by Chinese and foreigners alike. Violin professor Chen Youxin is one of the few graduates of the violin department since the establishment of the National Conservatory of Music. His profound mastery of the art is beyond doubt. Vocal professor Zhu Qi was a top student of Professor Xu Shilin. Other foreign professors include B. Zakharoff, A. Foa, and V. Shushlin, all renowned musicians in Shanghai who personally teach.</p>
<p>They hold regular concerts every semester. Since its establishment, they have performed more than ten times. Currently, the school building is insufficient and cannot expand the number of students. They have begun looking for another school building to reorganize and add undergraduate and normal departments. This first professor concert will be held at the Lyceum Theatre, and the proceeds will be used for reorganization expenses. The grand occasion at that time goes without saying.</p>
<h3 id="e96">"Princess Iron Fan" to be Screened at the Great Shanghai Theatre <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Great Shanghai Theatre's change to screening domestic films may be implemented as early as June. Zhang Shankun has put a lot of thought into the first film for the theatre. Showing "Home" at the theatre would certainly create a grand sensation, but there was a prior agreement with the Shanghai Guang and New Light Theatres, and the premiere rights for "Home" already belong to those two theatres. It is said that Zhang is considering using "Princess Iron Fan" as the first hit for the Great Shanghai Theatre. This is because it is the first feature-length Chinese cartoon, and the results of the preview screenings have been very impressive. It should be able to give the audience a fresh experience. The question, however, is whether it can be completed ahead of schedule.</p>
<h3 id="e97">My Opinions on Yue Opera <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xi</p>
<p>Although I am an amateur when it comes to opera, I have a deep love for it. I have seen and heard many performances from both the North and South. However, there are two types that I have never been interested in, namely Shen Opera and Yue Opera. Local operas generally have a rustic flavor, but these two are especially so. Shen Opera aside, when it comes to Yue Opera, it can be divided into two schools: Luantan and Didu. I remember when I was young, I watched performances by Wu Changshun, Wang Xiaokui, and other actors in temple fairs in my hometown (which were martial Luantan) and found them quite enjoyable. Didu troupes were not seen as often, because they mostly performed lewd, small-scale operas that were forbidden by the authorities. When I came to Shanghai, I was dazzled by the variety of performances and neglected my hometown productions. Those that I used to find enjoyable, I now discarded as waste. Therefore, although Didu was very popular in Shanghai in recent years, I was never moved by it, thinking it unworthy of my attention. Recently, at the invitation of a friend, I watched Yue Opera many times and realized that Yue Opera was able to become popular and attract thousands of viewers in the isolated island because its plot and lyrics are simple and common, which is its strength, and it best suits the tastes of women in general. However, there are also many aspects worth discussing. For example, the sounds and tones are not distinguished between male and female roles, which is a major flaw. Other aspects, such as the plot being illogical and the irritating slapstick humor, should also be gradually improved to suit the needs of the times, in order to break my biased view that I am not interested in Yue Opera.

<h3 id="e98">Beginning in May, Theaters to Pay Huge Taxes, Ticket Prices to Increase <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Various cinemas have received notices from the concession authorities that they will levy a 10% tax on ticket sales, starting in May. For example, Dahua will pay 24,000, Jincheng 14,000, and Xihai 6,200 yuan per month, etc. The amount is huge, as can be seen. This is based on the standard of full attendance every day. Theatre authorities have objections to this and will ask for business consideration. Once the tax increase is implemented, the tide will rise, and ticket prices will increase again.</p>

<p>(1) Xun Huisheng</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng, also known as Bingchao, and nicknamed Cier, initially studied Qin Opera Qingyi under Pang Qifa, and later studied Pihuang Huashan under Lu Yushan. After mastering his skills, he debuted on stage and became famous. Originally from Dongguang, Zhili, after becoming famous, his whole family lived in Yanjing. He later studied under Wang Yaoqing and was known as one of the Four Great Dan Actresses, along with Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, and Shang Xiaoyun. He traveled south many times and his reputation was very high. His art combines both civil and military skills, especially his depiction of the hearts of young girls, which is subtle and meticulous. Therefore, all the rising Dan actresses who study Huadan regard Huisheng as the standard, and he has become the founder of the Xun school. This spring, he was hired by the Golden Grand Theatre in this city and came south to perform. After only a month, he transferred to the Xinsheng Theatre. But the box office was still in short supply. Xun is usually very frugal and lives with his father and son, three generations under one roof. Recently, he will also have a grandson. The money he has earned from singing for decades has been slightly accumulated. The Liuxiang Hotel, which recently opened in the capital, was founded solely by Huisheng.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Zhang Cangqiu abandoned his life as a bandit on Rooster Mountain and went to the northeast to make a name for himself, which can be said to be a case of "where there's a will, there's a way." Who would have thought that he would become a hero in the wilderness? The affairs of the world are unpredictable, and one can never know for sure. Thinking this, he couldn't help but feel lost. After some time, he heard that Li Zicheng of Shaanxi led his troops into Jin, repeatedly capturing prefectures and counties, and his momentum was great. He sent people to Henan to contact bandits in various places, and naturally, envoys from Li Chuang were also sent to Green Stone Mountain. Li Xin had other plans and feigned compliance. The messengers left without getting what they wanted. Before long, he heard that Li Zicheng's main force had been fighting bloody battles for a long time in Daizhou and Ningwu Pass. Zhou Lianji, the commander-in-chief of Ningkai Pass, died in battle, and Jiang Xiang, the commander-in-chief of Datong, surrendered to the bandits. Wei Zicheng drove and walked to the capital. At this time, the world was shaken, and the two sides of the Yellow River were even more restless. Although Li Xin had no intention of marching north on a large scale, he recruited soldiers and horses at this time, took the food from the enemy city, and greatly increased his power, watching the situation and wanting to take the opportunity to move. At the same time, he was even more concerned about Xu Jing's safety. Who knew that Xu Jing had been in a tiger fight and a dragon fight, and had gone through many moving, amazing, and miraculous things? (End of Chapter 7)</p>
<p>Chapter 8 Fallen Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water</p>
<p>After Li Xin was captured by Red Maiden of Green Stone Mountain, Xu Jing was very worried. He thought that Li Xin's life was over. If he wanted to rescue him, he was afraid that his skills were shallow and his efforts would be in vain. He was very hesitant. The magistrate of Qi County, after reorganizing the defeated remnants, thought that Li Xin, Xu Jing, and others were all incompetent people and not worth relying on, so he became even more indifferent to Xu Jing. Xu Jing also felt bored and asked the magistrate of Qi County to leave the city and return to his home. His mother naturally followed him out of the city, but her sick body was frightened and she lay dying in bed. Medicine was ineffective, which made Xu Jing even more depressed and worried. He only drank heavily every day and was very bored. Before Li Xin returned after breaking free, Xu Jing's old mother passed away. After mourning, Xu Jing bought a high-quality coffin to hold his mother's remains, buried her in the ancestral tomb, and was left alone, even more desolate. At that time, the news from various places was not good, and the chaos in the world had already formed. He sighed to himself: "A man born at this time should not think about rising up and establishing fame, wouldn't it be wasting time, resigning himself to decline, and turning into rotten wood that cannot be carved?" So he thought of Wang Yongtai in Daizhou, and Zhang Cangqiu and others were far away in the northeast, and there was still no news. He didn't know what achievements they had made. Zhou Yuji, the commander-in-chief of Ningwu Pass, was one of the most capable generals of the time; Wang Yongtai was also his father's friend and would definitely help him. It would be better to go there and try it out first. Once he made up his mind, he entrusted the affairs of his home to his servant Liu San. He tidied up his luggage, brought the Scarlet Phoenix Sword, and rode a fine horse, abandoning his pen and joining the army, heading straight for Daizhou. (53)</p>
