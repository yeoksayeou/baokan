<h3>傳美援華物資運抵前　日將發動對滇軍事　中國在滇越交界處有完滿準備　切斷滇緬路運輸企圖決難得逞</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社二日重慶電日本在越南增兵事、已成爲此間官私各方最注意之問題、據可靠方面透出消息、「政府中人士深信日本企圖在美國援華物資大量運到以前、發動對滇軍事、俾得切斷滇緬路之運輸、但中國方面對此已有充分準備、此點頃經蔣委員長政治顧問拉鐵摩爾予以證實、」拉氏前日力由昆明歸來、據談此行雖未前往滇越交界地方但獲知日本在越確在準備行動、而中國則已有完滿之準備、龍主席及雲南人民、亦均有堅强抵抗之決心、至於日本向滇省人民鼓吹所謂大民挨主義、決無成效可言、又據某外國外交家之觀察、日本攻滇、須使用大量兵力、允其需要多數飛機、但現在越境之兵員遠不足以語此、而飛機更少、故目下當無發動可能、倘再加以地形險惡、瘴氣凶毒、以及日本尙未放棄對美談判，則是吾能發動此項攻勢、亦爲疑問云、</p>
<p>路透社二日倫敦電　路透社特派昌電稱、此間對於德國海社馬尼刺消息所傳、日本或將從事準備對泰國作嚴重之攻擊云云、已引起注意、以爲上海日當局之加以吾認、自在意中、並認此舉之用意、似係移轉注意、以掩蓋日方或將發動對中國滇省之攻勢、據稱主要緬甸接濟路綫雖係經過雲南城市、但此外另有一又路可不經該處而取道成都以達嘉定、此一路綫、若干時日前已在準備、目前即使尙不能通車、亦必將近竣工、是以關於華軍接濟之前途、實無須過慮云、</p>
<p>談判均歸失敗　美日關係緊張</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社一日華盛頓電　哥倫比亞廣播電臺播音員、一昨報吿時局消息時、力言華府政界及外交界人士、大都認爲美日緊張關係、已益趨嚴重、並謂日前外間會傳美國正與中英兩國　行談判、俾以英國之香港新加坡與中國之根據地四處、交由美國使用、此訊傳出之後、日本方面即已引起嚴重反　、同時各報亦以局勢嚴重爲宮、甚至預言美日關係、將於兩星期後尖銳化、民聲講壇報謂、日使野村、鑒於過去所有促進美日邦交之努力、均歸無效、頗有返國一行之意、此在泰晤士報、則謂美國旣不應對日讓步、預料日本不久勢將鋌而走險、此種悲觀論調、因上海方面頻傳日軍在華南及越北集中、而獲得證實焉、</p>
<p>合衆社二日華盛頓電納粹德國指責美國已攻擊德國潛艇而開始對德國作射擊戰爭、似係企圖援引三强盟的、此間外交觀察家相信日本自加入軸心公的後、其對於軸心及民主國之關係現時受最嚴重之測騐、美國修改中立法而准許美國船隻進入交戰區域後、日本之國際關係將更加緊張、因此舉將使有力之美國艦隊、立即在大西洋及他處與英國艦隊結合、而使希特勒遭遇自開戰以來在公海上之最有力之敵對、據信希特勒欲移轉美國注意於太平洋、並將盡力使日本打擊美國、因而引起日美危機或衝突、以减弱美國之干預大西洋方面、據信、美國海軍、將在可能範圍內調動太平洋上之軍力、但仍將保持主要之打擊力量於太平洋、以準備日本有任何行動、同時國務院官員論及德方之指責美國已開始射擊戰爭時、宣稱、羅斯福總統之宣言、已明白闡明美國之態度、彼等宜稱、德方之宣傳者、顯係企圖吾認有被攻擊之危險之國家有自衛之權利云、</p>
<p>德國拉攏日本　對美發動戰爭</p>
<p>合衆社二日華盛頓電　此間非官方界昨稱、納粹德國正式指斥美國業已對德開始肘擊戰、逕行射擊德國潛艇之舉、實爲德國企圖援引三國公的、俾將日本及義國牽入積極戰爭之前奏、德方所稱、美國驅逐艦「寇爾奈」號首先攻擊德潛艇者、殆謂「美國業已攻擊德國」、並表示納粹官吏係指三國公約之第三項規定也、衆信義日兩國均不致立即有何反響、又認義國當較日本更易反嚮、因日本當將仔細研究孰爲侵略者也、根據三國公的之規定、其中任何簽字國家、如遭受該的簽字時未參戰之第三國家之攻擊、其餘簽字國家應出而援助此被人攻繫之簽字國、惟每一國家均有權決定孰為首先發動侵略之國家云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二日重慶電　中央日報外交記者、今在國際週觀欄內、評論德國擊沉羅賓傑姆斯號事件、謂以歐局論、德　現無進攻美國之必要、亦無因美國廢止中立法而報復之必要、則其所以出此挑釁行動、期將美國拖入戰事者、端在爲日本减少太平洋上美海軍之威脅、使之安心在遠東有所行動而巳、一年來德國始終未能拉緊日本、認爲苦事、茲乃以最大決心、出此最後一着、但日本則仍在企圖不戰而獲、故對美蘇不斷恫嚇、以謀拆散美蘇在太平洋之聯繁、迫使蘇聯解決所謂懸案、並望美國許其在荷印取得石油云、</p>
<p>美驅逐艦擊沉　眾信美將參戰</p>
<p>路透社二日馬尼刺電　美國海陸軍聞路賓傑姆期號沉失之消息、大爲震怒、海軍允躍躍欲試、此已成公開秘密、菲島之美國軍民、現皆信美國參戰勢所不免、惟以距今幾何時美國將參戰爲詢耳、路賓傑姆斯號被擊沉之消息、傳到過遲，故今晨多數報紙不及發表批評、惟各報皆以大事刋此消息、菲島瑪布海報爲唯一菲文報謂、希特勒顯已對美作戰、而美國人民之感想與意見、不幸在此緊急時期猶禾一致、美人淸談而巳、而德國巳從事射擊矣云、</p>
<p>路透社二日華盛頓電　據一般意見、美驅逐艦路賓傑姆斯號之被擊沉、將使中立法修正案奮鬥中之若干可疑票投於政府方面、蓋若投反對票、則似對於現擊沉美船之希特勒予以綏靖也、斯克里浦係報紙之外交記者即抱此見解、並謂華盛頓外國駐使咸信路賓傑姆斯號後、必有他船繼之遇禍、致特迫令國會宣戰、目前美德兩國已在作戰中、正與中日兩國同云、</p>
<p>國際社二日柏林電　希特勒元首咋日對羅斯福總統之海軍紀念日演說、力予反駁、並指摘美國欲籍驅逐艦之攻擊德潛艇、以使美德陷於「眞正射擊戰」、據希氏稱、羅氏所提及之文件、用以表示德圖分割南美及廢棄世界宗敎者、「全出僞造」、希氏謂、「華驅逐艦格里爾號及寇爾奈號、未中魚雷前先行攻擊德潛艇、此時射擊戰實已開始、至於羅斯福總統演說中所提及之南美地圖以及德擬廢除宗敎之計劃、乃德國以外之他國所策劍者、德政府已通知各中立國、連中南美各國在內、此等文件、悉係僞迭、」希氏之言論、昨在東綫行營發表、且在柏林招待新聞記者特別會議席上、報吿外國新聞記者、</p>
<p>日對德國宣言　暫時拒不批評</p>
<p>合衆社二日東京電內閣情報局今日拒不批評德國之宣言謂美國已因該國之驅逐艦攻擊德國潛艇而開始對德作射擊戰爭、在接獲官方報告之前、不致有所批評、情報局云、「吾人必須仔細研究全文」因此事甚爲重要故也、現如遽下批評、允其關於上本對三國公約之義務事、實屬過早」、觀察家稱、日本人民似將準備接受德國之宣言、因美海長諾克斯上校及其他美國官員曾公開宣佈驅逐艦「寇奈爾」號曾被納粹潛艇襲擊之前、先投下深水炸彈也、日本人民將認此事爲美國侵略德國、惟又稱、日本根據三國公的對德國所責之義務、仍未因此涉及云、</p>
<p>路透社二日東京電日本通訊社發表一文、言日本對於國際時局之感想、並聲明日本已有應付任何局勢之準備、謂據可恃的觀察家之言論、捐稅之增高與物價之漲起等、乃東條完成日本戰時準備之勢力、東條不依賴美國以解決月前難關、故欲向國會謀取民衆諒解、如時局聽其自然變化、則勢將愈趨愈劣、解決之道完全繫於美國對日經濟壓迫之解除云、外相東鄉本擬在週杪出京赴皇陵與神社祭吿　職、但現已晨綏行期、此事｜殆頗有意義、</p>
<p>日本各報對美　一致大事抨擊</p>
<p>合衆社二日東京電　束京日文報紙木日一般的參加日日新聞及同盟社昨日之攻擊美國、謂日美關係現時已達到最惡劣之點、各報稱、日本已不復能任由華盛頓談判繼續停托中途之階段、各報言打破日美關係僵局之唯一方法、爲美國停止對日本壓迫、允其是經濟壓迫、中外商業新報稱、日本雖竭其能力以維持太平洋之和平、但不能因爲太平洋及世界之和平而放棄其生存之權利、採取行動以保護此生存之時間、巳漸漸近臨云、朝日新聞稱、美國對於日本之實力估量過低、美國在東京之自利政策、乃太平洋危機中之最大危險云、</p>
<p>英與論咸主張　助美對日作戰</p>
<p>倫敦　日首相東條所發表演說、英方之反響、今有堅決與諷刺憤怒之態度、每日電訊報之社論、對東條演詞之反駁、最為銳利、東條謂日本負責解決「中國事件」及建立「大東亞共榮圈」之使命、乃其莫大之光榮、該報則予反駁稱、「試問何方授權日本、負起屠殺刦搶之使命、神明與人類、決不至授權日方出此」、關於東條恫嚇美國於十一月十五日對日讓步、吾則日本即將重申履行三國公的及反共公的一節、英方有資格之觀察家謂、美國之條件乃日本完全放棄其侵略擴張行爲、非然者、雙方之衝突決無法避免、美海長諾克斯又曾提出此項警吿也、太平洋上固若發生射擊戰、則英國必毫不猶豫立助美方作戰、英美之海軍、即將組成兩洋艦隊、觀察家又謂、美國之輿論本贊成對日作戰、英方之興論亦厭惡日本之屢决恐嚇勒索、故目前英方各報、俱保持堅決一致之立塲、以反抗日本進一步之侵略云、（一日）</p>
<h3>日輪太陽丸　撤僑抵檀香山　日美戰事一時尙不致發生</h3>
<p>合衆社日火奴魯魯電　日輪「太陽丸」昨自日本駛來此間、載來撤退之人民三百四十五名、此舉使此間權威方面相信、日本國內反美運動雖形激烈、惟暫時似不致發動任何足以捲入對美作戰　渦中之行動、「太陽丸」定於十一月四日以後返東京、而「籠田丸」則將於今日離美、衆信此兩日輪在美國空軍勢力範圍之內時、日本似不致有何動作、「太陽丸」搭客中、十五人係美人、一爲英籍、其餘爲日人、在「太陽丸」之美人大部份係久居日本之敎士、據生於火奴魯魯副檢查官之日籍美人山口氏稱、「日人對中國戰事已感厭倦、不願再事繼續、惟彼等因感到經濟上之壓迫、遂信拓土爲唯一出路、按山口氏去年曾在日本某保險公司工作云</p>

<h3>太平洋之癌</h3>
<p>日閣更迭之後，美日間所進行的試探談話並未因而中斷，迄於最近，雙方的接觸仍在繼續保持之中，把東條內閣成立視爲日本仍採持重路綫者，似已於此獲得一個事實上的證明。不過談話縱未中斷，希望則益形微弱，至今那種綏靖日本的意見已全無存在餘地，而且也沒有任何人對於此項談話前途敢加以樂觀的信賴，因而連日輿情又轉到另一極端的悲觀。東條內閣成立後，卽決定於本月中旬召集特別議會，據聞在華盛頓的日方發言人曾經聲明：在本月十五日日議會集會之後或將發生危險局勢，而日方報章亦復多以美日關係將於兩星期後尖銳化爲言。這一太平洋之癌，是吾眞已達到潰決的節段，正是一個應當加以嚴重注視的問題。</p>
<p>檢討此一癌症形成的主因，是日本建立「大東亞共榮圈」的企圖，而助成此一癌症之發展者則爲軸心國家在歐戰中所造成的優勢。是以縱然「新秩序」「共榮圈」之議爲近衛在三年前所揭櫫，其造成實際的威脅則在去夏英法西錢敗北之後，而最近納粹以孤注一擲之勢造成在莫斯科外圍和頓河流域戰事中的進展，太平洋的風雲亦復隨而陡見緊張，假如不是納粹的武力和威勢始終尙爲英美蘇聯的重大威脅，遠柬問題自當不致如此棘手，美當局始終把殲滅納粹視爲第一要義，從這一點看來是不無有其相當理由的。不過遠東事變的爆發實遠在納粹掌握政權之先，軸心的侵略舉措無寗到是從遠東學來的榜樣，是以卽使納粹的威脅解除，固然大有助於遠東局勢的前途，而太平洋的危機則並不能因而根本消滅。三國同盟之若卽若離，美日談話之至今尙得繼續，都是基於這一原因；對於遠東危局的應付，實不能不在歐戰發展之外別作有效的攷慮。</p>
<p>首先需要加以確認的是日本擴展企圖的憑藉。任何人都曉得日本還要等待—等待更有利的時機；如果納粹擊潰蘇聯，英美的注意力復被牽引到大西洋的驚濤險浪當中，彼時在某一些人看來遠東大局自然有類孤立無吿，南進北進將無往而不宜。但是時機所能提供的便利只是事半功倍，斷非絕對不勞而穫，無論如何總還需要付出至低限度的資本與代價，除非這一資本業已完全耗竭，擴展妄念是不會歛跡的。四年苦戰固然造成了相當的衰疲，然亦適因久處戰爭之中乃能使全國漸决符合戰時體制。形成作戰機構，允其最近一年中，整備强化高度戰時體制並非徒託空言，和平產業是空前萎縮了，却大大增進了軍需生產，在經濟制裁之下雖得不到充分資源供給，其竭力搜括亦復不無成效，久戰之餘的實力縱在旁人認爲不堪一擊，其自身則未必不自信尙可一試。更何况近幾年間其海軍空軍擴充成果始終諱莫如深，卽使未必能有驚人奇蹟，而埋頭建軍也絕非渺無成效。是以所稱業已完成戰事機構的話，無論是吾還耍打些折扣，實應確認這是遠東危機的根本癥結。數年前列强的軍備競賽，結果證明都不免遲早捲入戰爭漩渦當中；如果一個人確是以勒緊肚皮換取大砲，誰也不信他在飢餓之中會僅以武器作爲炫威之用吧。</p>
<p>遠東危機的一再遷延絕非表示其終於不會爆發，而只是一方藉延宕等候時機求力量的更加充實，一方從事試探看擁護正義者是吾可以欺以其方。兩個月來的美日談判，廢時害事，深爲世人所詬病，但也並非一無所穫，至少已經證明了美國嚴守一貫立場不容干以非議，無論絮以甘言，膏一恫嚇，都不足以易其鑒定態度，這一情勢固不足以消弭太平洋危機，至少已使意國繳倖者體會了事態的嚴重，如必欲求貪慾的滿足，則必不能不付出其僅餘的一點資本，這種局勢自然不容掉以輕心，而這也就是一個表面溫和持重的政權竟能產生的原因。至於藏在這一溫和外衣裏面的則爲把戰時體制充實到最大限度，臨時議會的召集，大槪對內意義大於對外，所稱十五日以後或將發生危險局勢者仍屬恫嚇意味居多，自然像進攻滇緬路一類事也未嘗不可以隨時發生。</p>
<p>今日的南太平洋自然不像前此之暴露無吿，但以言應變，則無庸諱言其不够堅强，因之亦尙不足以遏制意外變亂的爆發；對於未來的結局，自然無可懷疑，但却應該更求禍變範圍的縮小與效率的增强。到處布滿了火藥的現在，如果發現了星星野火便斷不容不立時予以撲滅，一至蔓延之後，一切都要大感棘手了。</p>

<h3>羅斯福邱吉爾　大西洋會見始末（一）</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福與英國首相邱吉爾，曾於八月中旬，在北大四洋某處，舉行一次歷史性的會議，其經過詳情，茲參考英美報紙雜誌的紀載，譯述如决；</p>
<p>一九四一年八月十六日午後，美國梅因州奧克蘭港潮濕陳舊的碼頭接待室中，有五十個焦燥和沮喪的人，或坐或立。他們都是新聞記者，攝影員，和無纏電台報吿員等人。他們已守候了很多的時間—在麻州的斯溫斯各特守候過兩星期，在洛克蘭也守候了兩天了。</p>
<p>貝諾斯各特灣遠處整天的重霧，巳逐漸消失。大約三點鐘光景，碼頭上的人遠遠瞥見頭大身圓非常舒適的總統游艇「巴陀馬克」號，在防波提附近出現，並見海防巡艦」加利浦沙」號在一旁往來護衛。</p>
<p>這時候播昔員們便用一連串與奮的語調，向擴音器裏，滔滔講個不絕，警察們也全神貫注。藍灰色的「巴陀馬克」號慢慢的靠攏碼頭，從大西洋神秘的境界中安然歸來了。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統此次從白宮出發，作數萬哩有奇的遨遊，歷時適有十三日之久，其中大部份日子的行踪，都不公開露佈，一般人祗知道他在海上舉行神秘的會議罷了。</p>
<p>游艇靠定碼頭，總統第一件事，便是宣佈在游艇上接見各報記者。事前，他巳接到無綫電報吿，知道記者團在碼頭上恭候，所以靜坐艙中，神態自若，臉色愉快。總統的親信霍浦金坐在一旁。總統燃着一支駱駝牌捲烟，就向肥者們說沒有什麽新聞可以奉吿，僅謂邱吉爾先生已在戰爭的各方面，成立了完全的諒解，還說蘇聯作戰可以支持整個的冬季，明春獲得美國方面充分接濟後，仍當繼續抗戰，但是美國並不因他此行而更加接近戰爭。</p>
<p>紐約泰晤士報記者問及海上會議情形時，總統說他極願一談此行印象。第一是星期日晨在英國最新式戰鬥艦「威爾期親王」號後甲板上舉行盛大的禮拜，全艦官兵一齊參加，美國巡洋艦「奧古斯泰」號水兵兩三百名，與他們雜然並坐，精神十分融洽。禮拜係由英美兩國牧師領導，但講經則由英國艦長担任，俾與海軍習慣相符。</p>
<p>總統因爲不良於行，所以與邱吉爾首相迭决會議，除有一决在英艦上舉行外，其餘都是在「奧古斯泰」號上舉行的。總統自稱和邱吉爾盤桓一日以上，談及世界各洲情事。每一關的每一部分，無不談及。</p>
<p>總統說這次會口是他和邱吉爾共同發起的，其動機還在今年二月裏，但因希臘和克里特島發生戰事，致將預定的會期，延擱三個月之久。</p>
<p>某記者追問總統道，總統與邱吉爾所共同宜佈的八項和平方針，並沒有提到怎樣摧毀「納粹暴政」的方法。總統答道，道種看法，未免狹隘。此次會議的主旨，乃在交換現在和將來的各種見解罷了。</p>
<p>另一記者間他和邱吉爾是吾已在戰爭的各方面，成立完全的諒解。他答道：是的，我想是如此離。</p>
<p>又有人問道：「美國是否已因此更加接近戰爭？」總統說，並不。但不許記者把這話加上括符，作爲總統的親口表示。</p>
<p>至於他和邱吉爾的會議，怎樣完成一層，總統懂稱，雙方仍將進一步交換意見。</p>
<p>蘇聯是吾須履行此八項原則？」某記者問。總統答道，在這位記者發問以前無人曾想及此層，但會議中曾談及，在趕造軍備計劃內，應顧及蘇聯的需要。</p>
<p>此項需要分爲兩類：一類是在今冬以前運到蘇聯的各種緊急軍用品，另一類是供明春作戰用的各種軍用品。</p>
<p>有人問總統對於蘇聯作戰到底的決心，有無疑惑，總統答這，他相信照剛才的說法，巳假定蘇聯能够作戰到底了。</p>
<p>最後，總統還說，他對於法國和遠東方面最近的局勢，稍見隔膜，但明天回到華盛頓後，即當與赫爾國務卿從長計議。</p>
<p>游艇於三點鐘進港，到四點鐘時，總統一行登岸，坐汽車前往車站，乘坐四點十分車回京。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統乘之赴會的是九千零五十噸的巡洋艦「奧古斯泰」號，即是美國原駐亞洲艦隊的戰艦，上海人都曾在黃浦江中見過。邱吉爾所乘的是三萬五千噸最新式戰鬥艦「威爾斯親王」號。雙方還有護衛艦多艘，其合併的實力，足的應付任何大規模的海戰。</p>
<p>各艦集合處多半是北大西洋紐芬蘭無疑，或者即在普拉聖蒂亞灣，與現在建造中的美國新式大規模海軍根據地相距不遠。該處海岸綫崎嶇脊磽，會議期間正在霧季。</p>
<p>會議日期係在八月九十兩日。首由邱吉爾，嘴啣特長雪茄燜，昂視闊步跨上「奧古斯泰」號。他穿着深藍色海軍制服，胸前八扣銅鈕，已被嘴邊掉下來的烟灰熏得發暗。脚上那雙齊踝的長統皮靴，是路時本來嗤嗤作聲，此刻已一半發不出聲來。他先以封信面交羅斯福總統，並致寒暄道：「總統先生，得代陛下致函問候，不勝榮幸。」</p>
<p>羅斯福微笑答謝。這位英國首相又矮又胖，曲背臉紅，生着一副犬似地牙骨，頭上有簷的帽子，斜罩着稀稀落落幾莖黃髮，笑容可掬的站着，活像一位怕羞的小天使，惹人憐愛。那位美國元首，身裁高大，態度大方，生着副可樣倔强的牙骨，厚實的肩膀向後挺着，頭頸側向一邊，每逢到新頴而重要的事情，他總是道樣的。</p>
<p>這不過是八月九日，他們初次會見的情形。他們在分手前，交誼已更一層了。翌日，星期日，「奧古斯泰」號靠近「威雨斯親王一號，總統跨過活動跳板，參加禮拜。此後會議是在一奧古斯泰」號上舉行的。</p>
<p>關於某决會議情形，倫敦每日郵報會記載美國某官員的談話，內容如下：</p>
<p>在各决會議之中，總統和邱吉爾首相兩人，究竟誰比誰更加愉快，實難斷言。他們在大西洋長途電話中交談數月之後，相知已深，所以一見面好像是舊雨重逢一般。他們互道寒暄之後，便熱烈談起各種問題來了。</p>
<p>羅斯福邱吉爾會見留影</p>

<h3>抑平物價三原則　尊三</h3>
<p>高抬物價，近年來之上海原已司空見慣，然如今日之狂漲猛瀉，有如飛機之急升俯衝，實未之前有。視金價之日漲千百，法幣似已成爲上次歐戰中之馬克盧布；然紗價之同時日瀉千百，則顯非法幣本身之危機。囤積投機，爲今日物價高漲之主要原因，早爲社會所公認。要非無法無天之區，究亦不該任其長此猖獗。若謂上海已入無法無天之時代，則五步一警，十步一兵，依然法令森嚴，亦未免抹煞當局之努力。是則問題不在人謀之不力，乃在人謀之無方。如何抑平物價？拾取締囤積投機莫屬！早爲眾論所歸。然如何取締囤積投機？尚有待各方之努力。</p>
<p>本報一日社評，曾揭藥三端：（一）取締現有之囤積，並防止供匯進口後之囤積。（二）結束現有之銀行押款，並取締銀行今後之繼續承做押款。（三）取締黃金交易，消滅一般商品投機之線索。此三者，實爲抑平本市物價之基本原則，非此不足以求今後市場之穩定。</p>
<p>法幣之供給雖有限，然物價之無限高漲，究須有等量之通貨配合而後可。如何供給有限之法幣，而能適應今日物價無限之高漲，顯由銀行通貨之造出，爲階之厲。貨儲於倉，即通貨浮游於外；銀行承做貨物押款，旣在增進投機囤積，又在增大市場通貨之供給。故取締囤積與禁做押款，直接上旣可約束商品投機，間接上更可收縮商場通貨。商品之囤積投機的防止，則貨物之供需，自易平衡。銀行通貨之造出，亦即失共根據。銀行押款之停做，囤積投機即失其靠山，而市場通貨之供給，亦可以大大減少。故兩者必須同時並進，方克有效。</p>
<p>囤積投機，目的不外乎二：一爲乘機漁利，一爲變相之資本逃避。此皆受金價暴漲之刺激所致。法幣制度下之物價，依理不復與金價聯繋；唯金屬本位之貨幣思想，依然深入人心。金價狂漲，人皆認即法幣價值之貶跌，並認爲一般物價上漲之水準。方今之世，各國均已禁金出口；因之一地金市發生求過於供，即無自然調節之可能。於是物稀爲貴，必然有增無減。初非幣值之貶跌，而其結果則爲促成幣值之貶值。幣制基礎雖不致中傷，物價水準已不免大受其累。在此場合，衹有二路可走：若不糾正人心，即應根本消滅其交易。糾正人心，事實上有所不能；故禁金自由交易，爲今世各國所採之唯一對策。我國原已採行此制，奈上海獨逍遙法外。故欲裁斷金價對於物價之惡劣影響，非以租界當局之權力爲後盾不可。不然：租界當局雖能注力於囤積之取締，與銀行停做押款，若仍放任金市之投機，則仍將使囤積投機之復活，押款交易之再烯。因金價之上漲，即在喚起囤積投機上之鉅利，押款交易，亦即不能求其根絕。</p>
<p>本刊上其曾有大可君建議：（一）平準會應儘先供給米煤，勿與其他申請者同樣辦理。因米煤市場穩定，可減輕一般人對於幣值下降之恐慌心理。（二）由平準會指定若干商行，辦理必需品之進口業務，並負責保證其申請之外匯確用於申請之用途；並依申請所得之外匯，作爲決定進口物價之標準。（三）由英美政府宣佈中國領土內所有之一切進口匯票，非經平準會蓋章認可爲無效。除第三點尚有待英美政府之協助外，第一點已經平準會切實宣佈米煤外匯之續供無懈，第二點則正由租界當局支持組織進口商協會中，大致可望發生同樣之效力。惟此尚限於調整來源，流通過程上之調整，尚有待於上列三原則之實現也。</p>
<h3>怎樣制止物價猛漲</h3>
<p>— 陳華璋</p>
<p>近二十天來，物價急遽上漲，除了投機操縱之輩，市民們莫不痛心疾首。照理，平準會已通知各有關銀行，增多十一月份進口食物與煤之外匯（見路透社香港三十日電），接着工部局總董李德爾與美董明思德將赴港，與平準會商請供給必需物品更多之外匯，物價應當跌下來；然而並未見跌，本月一日起，食物又以漲價聞，如此下去，絕大多數市民的生活，將何以爲繼！租界當局今次對物價的措置，確是煞費苦心；可惜還嫌遲緩一些。所以，尚盼迅採有效措置，澈底執行。筆者並在這裏貢獻一些芻蕘之見。</p>
<p>積極性方案</p>
<p>報戰公共租界工部局會召海上進口洋行三十五家之代表舉行會議，計劃成立一進口商協會，促成工部局管理特價計劃之有效實施。細則尚未公佈，故內容不詳。想來，此協會成立之後，進口物價總可藉此以抑平，同時至少又可協助租界當局管理物價。所以，我們希望它能圓滿成立，更企求租界當局站在監察地位，不可循情。使該協會做到平物商號的功能。關於此種商號的設立，九月二十二日申報經濟專刊曾有文論及。茲錄其要點如下：「平物商號之設立，可參酌平準會之原理。即物價受投機作崇抬高時，出而收買貨物。務使物價在一定水準上，不使本市商號有暴利與虧折之現象發生。」</p>
<p>前幾天英文大美晚報曾爲文建議組織一消費者協會，以協助當局管理物價；該會應有廣大權力，必要時，可舉辦消費合作事業，售與會員之物品，衹收最低利益。這確是一個用意很好的辦法。本來，消費合作的功效避免商人的抬價剝削，更可調節供給，平抑物價，至於消費合作的成功，以能完成消費合作的組織網爲先決條件，換言之，即必使消費合作社能普遍分佈以後，乃能發生偉大的效用。所以，此種消費者協會若果成立，還得要使它能普遍才是。故此事之成，端賴租界當局與各公團領導；並採取更有計劃的步驟。</p>
<p>上述兩種辦法，可稱最理想的，並具有積極性；但非一踏可成，目下物價漲到如此地步，遠水已不能救近火，須要緊急措置。</p>
<p>緊急的措置</p>
<p>十月漲風至月秒尚不見稍煞，十一月開始的現在還在更形高漲。揆諸平常物價漲落的原因，不外供求與幣值關係。而漲落的程度，亦有其一定限度。今則全非，旬餘來，黃金黑市，價高逾倍，每條（十兩）竟至二萬二三千元。各種物品又惟黃金馬首是瞻，金價漲，則百物隨之而漲。講道理，物價與黃金是風馬牛不相關，然而在人爲的操縱下，偏要跟着它走，那末只有租界當局禁止黃金黑市的非法交易，早爲識者所建議。傳聞目前禁止現金交易，即係工部局所勸阻，如果屬實，不失爲賢明的措置；可是又有了場外現金私自交易尚望再採進一步的對付，再進而對紗花市場派員監視。這也是制止物價狂漲的不可或少之辦法。</p>
<p>其次，今次物價的空前狂漲，千言萬語只一名，全是國積居奇。例如：平準會現已通知各有關銀行，增多供給食物與煤的外滙，同時，米煤來源陸續應大跌其價；可是米價依然上升，煤價暗盤橫跳。所以，惟有針對囤積居奇，來一個嚴厲的對付。分析囤積居奇者，可別爲三種人物：一爲一般所謂之奸商，奸商的囤積居奇，本以資力雄厚的批發商居多數；在目前，零售商人的囤積居奇，亦甚顯著，退一步說，零售商人縱不囤積，而居奇爲無可否認的事實。二爲本非商人，鑒於囤積居奇有暴利可獲，也跟蹤着批購貨物，待善價而沽，他的行爲，與奸商並無差別；但他的資力，常在一般零售商人之上。三爲稍有積蓄的消費者，鑒於物價飛漲不已，於是紛將日用必需品等，事先購儲，此種行爲雉非居奇，仍屬囤積。爲了要澈查這三種人物起見，租界當局不妨挑選優秀的巡捕，組爲經濟警察，分派各處，隨時探查；同時，市民應與之切實合作，爲檢舉的工作。如查獲上述三者中之任何一種，勒令依照合理價格脫售，並視其情節輕重處罰之。關於此種詳細的處置，可訂一警律公佈之。</p>
<p>强大的後盾</p>
<p>再次，說到平準基金會，它的力量足以左右上海的市場，過去和現在，它始終供給必需品進口的外滙，所可惜的是未曾明白表示，直到上月杪，方纔見到兩個自港發出的電訊；可是這不具體，我們希望它按月公佈供給必需品進口所需的外滙數額，藉此消散投機者的疑神疑鬼，根絕種種無稽的謠傳。至於平準會本身對物價應有的立場，誠如西務經濟專家安翰能所說：「平準會得有極好的理由，堅持下列兩項原則：（一）平準會結滙進口的物品，不准操縱居奇，此種物品須照平常合法商人利益出售，不得逾分；新貨價格須照平準會規定滙率計算，本地存貨須照新貨計值出售。（二）平準會結滙進口物品，不准囤積，必須於市場需要時出售，如求過於供，進口商須用分攤方法分配供給，顧慮買主的實際消費量，而非其儲藏量。（三）本市租四腳蛇當局應與平準會切實合作，並協助實踐上述兩原則。這樣，平準會當樂於源源供給必需品進口的外滙。</p>
<p>最後，上海今日的繁榮局面，如果要使它繼續，俾大家享受的話，那末上海的中外市民，都該負起責任來，與租界當局密切合作。總不懂投機者要弄得物價漫無止境的上漲，以致多數市民走頭無路，促使上海趨於個糟。若果眞到了這地步，請問他們囤貨在手，有什麼用處：難道還好　眼前那樣享受嗎？正告投機操縱之輩：目光應放遠，你個所處境地，宛如螳螂見蟬，喜形於色；安知螳螂之後，尚有雀子在呢！此外，一般市民在此物價高漲聲中，尤應鎭定，切勿輕信謠傳，爭相購貨，替投機操縱之輩造機會。要知目前的現象是暫時的，當局決不願聽任物價無理狂漲的！</p>
<h3>經濟史與經濟學史</h3>
<p>— 沈麒玉</p>
<p>我國經濟素稱落後，近年以來，有志靑年，負笈歐美，研究經濟以期深造者不乏其人。唐君叔高，爲當代國學先進唐蔚芝老先生之哲嗣，家學淵源，不愧將門之子。留美專攻經濟，我國經濟專家與著名教授中不可多得之人才。歷任國內諸大學教授，久爲國人所推重。好學深思，虛心探討；爲人沈默寡言，謙恭和藹。對於中國經濟思想史獨感興趣而多心得，近編中國經濟思想，乃十年來精心研究之結晶。上卷詳論我國古代經濟思想，已於戰前出版，列爲商務印書館大學業書之一，洋洋巨著，極爲珍貴。本刊曾載朱通九先生介紹我國著名統計專家劉大鈞（季陶）先生之鴻文。茲則擬將唐先生對於中國經濟思想史之研究結論，陸續介紹於讀者之前，以助國內研究經濟者對於我國經濟思想變遷上之認識。——作者附註</p>
<p>世人往往不能辨別經濟史與經濟學史之性質。經濟史乃研究某經濟社會中各種制度之歷史，舉凡工商農業財政制度之起源及其發展，均在探討之列。經濟學史則研究經濟科學發達之狀况，與前者不同。；例如英國經濟學家，浦雷斯氏（L．L．Price）曾著英國經濟學史“A　History　　of　　Political　Economy　in　England”一書，又艾世萊教授（Prof．W．J．Ashley）則著有英國經濟史“Economic　History　of　England”一書。讀者茍將兩書名稱與內容詳細比較，當可明瞭經濟史與經濟學史之區別。</p>
<p>經濟史研究之重要，今已舉世公認。然在百年之前經濟學猶屬幼稚，不爲學者所重視。一八〇五年時德國學者出而反對經典學派，別創歷史學派，主張採用歷史方法，以闡明經濟學原理。彼等努力研究歐洲各國之經濟史，提倡相對主義與絕對主義不同。此種觀念，實予研究經濟者一大便利，亦經濟學之一大進步也。按相對主義（Relativism）包含三種因素：（一）時間，（二）地點，（三）環境，主張應用經濟原理，須受三種限制加以檢討。欲知何種經濟學理能否適用於某種時間地點及環境，勢非研究經濟史不可。此派名家甚多，如德國之羅孝（W．Roscher），許穆勒（G．Schmoller），英國之艾世萊，克寗漢（W．Cunningham）尤負聲譽。自歷史學派學說盛行，後設人始注意經濟史之重要，而學者亦重視經濟史之研究。</p>
<p>凡研究學術，必先收集準確資料，始能從事研究。經濟史資料之來源不外下列六種：（一）經濟史書籍，（二）經濟思想史書籍，（三）經濟雜誌，（四）經濟法令，（五）政府經濟報告，（六）政治家及經濟家之傳略。經濟史且與政治，法律，社會，倫理等社會科學均有密切關係，凡治經濟史者不可不研習之。</p>
<h3>金價會影響法幣嗎</h3>
<p>— 伊普</p>
<p>上海物價所以飛漲，其主要因素，固爲囤積居奇；然除此而外，尚有多種使物價昂貴之因素。其中之一，即爲目下之黃金賭博。此種黃金賭博，實為一種「胡鬧」。烚赤市場，純爲一種人爲交易；實際上流通之金條僅一千條至一千五百條，爲數極微。由於現貨極爲有限，投機者即可用交易辦法，使赤烚市價起巨大之漲落。現貨之數目旣有限，抬高價格自非難事。同時，彼等出入其他市場，購買商品，股票及公債；結果所致，價格亦隨之上漲。街頭之普通人民，見烚赤飛漲，以爲法幣跌落；亦至市場購買同樣之商品，股票及公債。此種物品本由投機者所吸收，至此吐出，利占大有。</p>
<p>此種循環情形，屢見不鮮；物價乃愈盤愈高。此事之不合理，可於下列事實中見中。美國政府目下收買黃金之價格爲每盎司美金三十五元（官定滙率），然上海則每盎司之價格竟達美金五十七元，或且過之。我人應於此處鄭重指出：此種虛僞之價值，純爲金條現貨缺乏，及貧得無饜之投機者盡其所能，以魚肉大眾二事所引起。公眾若遽認此種現象爲法價貶值之結果，而忽視投機胡鬧之威脅；不智實甚。我人決不能將赤烚在本市之市價，作爲法幣價格之繩準。因法幣價格與黃金之眞價值相比，並不下落。此間之黃金，發生「不眞」價值，純係人爲之原因。</p>
<p>公眾對於橫行各市場之操縱者，應加注意，不得爲其所愚。因投機者故意掀風作浪，造成混亂局面；受其害者，終爲大眾。人民對上海黃金價格愈注意，中投機者之圈套亦愈深。衹須檢討過去數週所發生之事，投機者造成最嚴重之局勢，貽害大眾，從而自肥，即不難相見。欲謀補救，只有對不難想見。欲謀補救，只有對閉，再者整個社會，爲對付此種人物之橫行而自衛計，亦應有所潛畫。上海法幣之價格，若因每日爲數極少之少數烚赤交易，而生軒然大波，實屬不可思議。</p>
<h3>市場學ABC　顏料</h3>
<p>— 范學暉</p>
<p>歐戰時的嬌子</p>
<p>在滬洋商　在戰事未發生前，上海的顏料進口，均在六百萬關金左右；德國居首位，約佔七成；英美日本瑞士次之。他們在上海設立的代表：</p>

<p>日本照華顏料廠　自設分行</p>
<p>歐西諸國顏料，行銷我國很早。日本起初只有硫化元靑。因爲硫化元靑的製造程序比較簡單。但民國十五·六年間，已有各種彩色染料來華。可見日本顏料工業在即時候方始萌芽。</p>
<p>民國二十年左右，華商大中顏料廠創立，專造硫化元靑，廠址在龍華鎭；軍興後，上海淪陷，該廠受戰事影響而停業，迄今仍無出品。</p>
<p>用途別類　顏料的種類雖多，各種牌子不下千餘種，然總括可分二大類。用途雖亦甚多，然主要的也不外是染羊毛，染棉布，染蠶絲三種。茲依其性質，用途，作以下的分析。</p>
<p>（一）安尼林（人造染料）</p>
<p>A直接性顏料　直接性顏料計有大紅，湖藍，黑，桃紅，靛藍，黃，金黃，棕，紫醬，墨綠，雪靑，藏靑等色，其用途如染棉織品，蔴織品。植物織維品都能應用之。在不退顏料尚未來華之前，我國布廠多採用是項顏料，即今內地及上海之較小布廠或染廠尚採用之。</p>
<p>B鹽基性顏料　鹽基性顏料計有玫瑰，品紅，黃，綠，金黃，靑蓮等色。其用途約有多種，如染人造絲，紙料，木料，骨料，化裝品，食品着色及其他工業中之原料。</p>
<p>C酸性顏料　酸性顏料計有靑蓮，綠，黃，藏靑，桃紅，紅，金黃，品藍，元靑，棕等色，其用途如染羊毛，蠶絲等物，及其他動物織維和昆蟲織維。</p>
<p>D　缸性顏料</p>
<p>（一）陰丹士林　大德顏料廠出品</p>
<p>（二）克力登　大英顏料廠出品</p>
<p>（三）汽巴能　汽巴顏料廠出品</p>
<p>（四）保晒靈　恒信顏料廠出品</p>
<p>養缸性顏料，又名還原染料，各種用法大同小異；是我國大規模織布廠，或染廠多採用之，並適宜機器染色。有各種顏色。</p>
<p>E印花顏料</p>
<p>（一）印地料案爾　（二）拉披達</p>
<p>這兩種印花顏料是大德出品，計分大紅，紫醬，茄花，藍，綠，桃紅　色。專用以印花，如今日之棉布，床毯，被單等棉織品都以此項顏料印之。</p>
<p>F納夫吐顏料　　納夫吐顏料是大德出品：計分大紅，金黃，紫醬，靑蓮，藍，桃紅，黃等色；其用途除染色外兼可印花。</p>
<p>G硫化性顏料　硫化性顏料計有元靑，軍衣黃，棕，藏靑。不過沒有鮮艷各色。用途專染棉布。</p>
<p>（二）靛靑</p>
<p>靛靑是一種藍色，是餐缸性顏料，計有二十成，五十成，六十成，八十成。專銷我國之農村鄉鎭；吾國地大物博，農民眾多，故靛靑銷路極大。</p>
<p>靛靑售價按成份照算；成份越高售價越貴。</p>
<p>包裝估價　顏料的裝璜共分多種：如桶，聽。又有在小之別，茲以其裝璜量，和合天秤與公斤若干，以及交易時一箱共裝幾聽，列表如下：</p>
<p>顏料裝璜及用量大槪如此，不過也有例外的裝法，不能盡述之。</p>
<p>市場中心　顏料同業在上海約有四五十家，戰時新組織亦有十餘家。顏料商的進貨中心，大都皆是德孚洋行；雖然恒信，南星，卜內門等也有交易，不過佔十分之二三而已。在戰時的上海的顏料市場，一切的市價變動都跟德孚盤子，因此德孚洋行無形地成爲上海顏料交易的主體。</p>
<p>每天早晨，在德孚的辦公時間　中，顏料業中跑街，和經理才多集中該處；故市價的變動，市面存貨的厚薄，很迅速的傳遍市面。</p>
<p>本牌包牌　顏料的進貨有的桶裝，有的聽裝，顏料號以桶子顏料批進之後自己分裝小聽，標了商標，便變了所謂顏料業中的「本牌」。</p>
<p>顏料業中有一種叫做「包牌」，包牌的辦法，就是同業中向洋行方約定某一塊牌子的顏料，限於約定的性質，取得專賣的權利；包銷的義務，就是盡量推銷，和銷足約定的數額，如果一年之中銷數不足，須由包銷者墊款出貨。</p>

<h3>融五社廿三次講經　闡揚有教無類學說</h3>
<p>（續）且指關公篤信云，迦勒底史稱，「福音夙播中國，皆聖多默（St·Thomas)之力。來華傳敎史，「五世紀馬宗主敎阿該護，（Achaeus）六世紀聶勘多略，（Nestorian）宗中敎西拉，（Silas)八世紀撒利巴薩加（Salila-Zacha）等，已設中國主敎區。」「七世紀，修正叙利亞文日課經，有述及中國，且華人能叙利亞語，度必十二宗徒之一。十叫紀初，聶宗主敎挨伯耶穌（Ebedjesus）承生長中國之耶伯拉罕（Yahballaha)三世旨，聯想及多默宗爾，」故「十六紀　中國敎徒」一書駁上諸說出於晚近附會。十七紀，當明熹宗天啓五年，西安掘獲唐德宗建中二年佾景凈所撰景敎流行碑，兼用叙利亞文，稱「太宗十二年詔大秦上德阿羅本。」見意敎士艾儒略（Giuleo　Aleni）。西學凡附錄，李之藻景敎碑書後，引耶敎義爲證，王溥唐會要云「波斯僧阿羅本，」貞元釋教錄，「大秦寺波斯僧景淨，應傳彌尸訶敎。」唐書武宗紀「大秦穆護襖，」宗敎思想史指即耶敎徒云，姚寬西溪叢話，錢謙益景敎考，以波斯大秦摩尼襖敎爲一源。杭世駿景敎續考，引天方古史，證爲回敎。錢大昕金石文跋，王昶金石萃編，亦述及之。有人云，碑文「釋子用壯」，「呂秀嚴書，」意射玄奘呂巖，疑必明時贗品。」</p>
<p>淸光緒中，燉煌石室更發現世尊布施論，三威蒙度讃等，日本羽田亨藏序聽迷詩所經，李盛鐸得志元安樂經，宣元至本經云，傳敎史稱阿羅本爲聶宗徒，十三紀歐洲十字軍之役，羅馬敎皇得元助力，世祖入踐,耶敎隨傳中國。馬可孛羅（Marca-Polo）遊記，有齋詔致敎皇，招高深敎士，取耶墓燈油等。淸洪鈞元史譯文證補云，「也里可溫爲天主敎，」即多桑旭烈兀傳，「蒙古人稱天主敎爲阿勒可溫，」崇福司管與釋敎宣政院管，道敎集腎院管同。梁相記稱，「鎭江總管建七寺，」兪樾序楊文杰東城記餘，「大普興寺奉也里可溫敎，與景敎流行碑「判十字以定四方」之說同。」十六紀傳敎誌敎典「江南佛寺由方會修院改成，」雜誌「西藏喇嘛敎與聶宗同源，」作爲中國古代耶敎淹沒之證。元成宗時，敎廷遣方濟各會意人蒙高味諾（Giovanni　Montecorvion）來上都，十四紀初任總主敎，始創中國傳敎區。致歐洲書云，「宗徒或共子孫，從禾至中國。</p>
<p>據傳教史誌，首准傳教者，十六紀中，耶穌會葡人包來篤（Melichior　Nuncz　Ｂarrato)於聖舫濟（S　Francis）(Xavier)來華未成，死上川島。後三年，始抵澳門。其日記亦云，「中國從未聞福音及天主降世事」，後奧斯定會班人拉達（Martino　de　Her　Rada)住閩一一月餘，搜集書籍至百餘種，研究中國內情，創中國語言學。班雄主斐力伯（Don　Phlippe）第二會衛奉告書中國皇帝，進珍貴貢品，見傳教誌。耶穌會司鐸意人范禮安（Alexandre　Valiguani)知中國傳教匪易必有計劃步驟，適應中國，革傳教舊法，徵選能材，先習中國禮儀言文，用以佈道。得羅明堅（MicheleRuggieri）,遜忍善交，西士全中國化，始造聖母堂，供攜來聖母像，用中文述天主寶錄，萬曆十二年印行，粵督陳瑞巡察澳門，羅代薩阿（Don　Leonardo　de　Sao)主教陳，一外僑托庇，原皆中朝順民」。又上書云，「冒險重洋，仰慕天朝，願列子民，改從僧服」，　四僧，詳其日記。助手利瑪寶（MatteoRicci)承范旨，儒服華言引中國經典以證教理，利用講學，交接士夫，領洗者有徐光啟，洗名呆祿，瞿汝夔洗名納爵，李之藻洗名良等，始奠中國傳教之基。死神宗賜葬。十七紀初，耶穌會西士悉奉正朔。至清初，德人湯若望（Joannes　Adam　Schall　Von　Bell）賜號通微敎師。康熙时，此人南懷仁（Ferdinandus　Raux),葡人李拱良（Joesph　Riberio）,高守謙（Verissimo　Monterio　de　Serra）西十職司天者。直至道光十七年，康照二十四年，多敏我會羅文藻首任華籍主敎。民國十一年，首任宗座專使剛恒毅總主教（Mgr·Ceiso　Costantinl　Archbishop　of　Theodosia)來華考四元四年三十一年，三次以弗所會，重耶穌神道爲正宗，按人道聶宗爲異端，後成波斯宗。一千又五十四年，離異西都之羅馬敎會者，分希臘宗。一千五百十七年，德人路得革正教公教之舊，而創新教，為路得宗。嘉慶十二年，英人馬禮遜來華傳新教，據倫敦會漢譯聖經，至二十四年，漢英字典迄今中華基督教會，聖工會，公理，浸禮始編漢英字典。迄今中華基督敎會，聖公會，公理，浸禮，信義，長老，內地，美以美等新敎各宗，遍滿中國。</p>
<h3>上海的娼妓（四）</h3>
<p>— 可羣譯</p>
<p>上海之高等外國妓院，類皆向工務當局登記爲「寄宿者」。此種妖院，全滬僅五六家，其問女子之代價，平均的在五十元左右。若一顧客欲在此種妓院中買飲，同時，更須購酒贈飲全院之其他女子。如此，一飲所需，通常即須五十元，實際上，此輩女子幷不眞飲，而僅飲些麥酒（Ginger　Ale）而已。</p>
<p>據一位外籍之聲師吿記者：此中之女子對於衛生常識，均有良好之認識，若她們染有疾病時，通常她們皆暫免工作，直至經醫師治愈爲止。雖在少數之情形下，她們已患有疾病者而仍爲院主迫令繼續工作亦有，但即使她們已患有疾病，而因她們具有良好之衛生知識，故與之發生關係者，被傳染疾病之機會，可謂少見。</p>
<p>此種妓院中之女子，院主遇之甚優，許多年老之外國婦人，能藉此致小富，立刻積儲得小數之資財。此等妓女每夕僅接客數人耳，其間有數女且已染有吸毒嗜好，至此輩娼妓之國籍，以俄籍爲最多數；英美籟及斯干地那維亞（Scandinavian)婦人亦有混雜其間；更有少數之娼妓爲德籍猶太人。</p>
<p>此種妓女，其墮入此業之經過，大致最初均係因其他種種原因而滯留上海，而充酒排間之女侍，酒排問中之工作時間甚長，而彼等之工作父是色情的。故每當一高等妓院中之代表人以利誘彼等時，幷吿之曰。「如願往彼處者，能獲更多之金錢，共法也至易」。在此種情形下，她們傾聽甘言後，寗不心焉嚮往，終乃墮入其彀中。她們墮入妓院後，復覺生活較易，因之，她們亦安之若素，開始此種新生活矣。晚間如感身體疲乏時，即有人獻以濃烈之烟以調劑她們之困憊，經此興奮劑後，則她們之精神復振，幷回復愉快。以後如再感困憊時，彼等仍有濃烈之烟而供調劑，如是者經數周後，她們便上癮了。此固爲上海之外國銷金窟內娼姣們之一般生活情形。惟生活稍嚴肅者，亦不乏其人，故尙有少數之女子，其生活情形較好，不如前述之糜爛，她們積蓄了小額之金錢以備離開上海，或作爲開始其他正常事業之用。</p>
<p>上海尙有十餘家以上之妓院，其中所費，則較以上所述之高等妓院略便宜。此種妓院，牠們的門口俱有甚奪目而相當之名稱標示着，此種妓院中之女子，都是俄國人及高麗人，她們的價格，則自三十元至五十元不等。</p>
<p>滬上尙有一種高貴之妓女，似屬良家婦女，私操此業。其目的無非爲博取金錢，以供個人享受。去該種妓院問津者，必須有識途老馬之紹介引進，方能進入其門。比入，即有一莊嚴之中年婦人出爲招待，以茶饗客，經其問明往遊者之身份，地位，以及經濟狀况後，如彼認爲滿意者，便即問客，喜召何種型之女子，高大的抑細小的？肥胖者抑瘦俏者？任客自定，如該客選定其所欲何種型之女子後，彼即從中接洽，爲之召喚。按常例，婦女們召來後，不即入客室，先於門上之小窗洞內向室內張望，審視室中之顧客，是吾與她熟識，如此人她所認識者，她便不進室中。此中之女子，通常僅允作一次會晤，其一夕之資，價在二百元至一千元之間。除此之外，顧客們亦常有爲其製華貴之服裝。</p>
<p>據一中國性病專家稱，有許多富有之華人，在此輩婦女處而染有惡疾者；同樣的，有許多婦女在她們尋歡作樂及求取零用錢之一舉兩得之原則下，經此種處所之拉攏，因而亦受有惡疾之傳染。</p>
<p>餘外尙有數百之西洋一私娼」，在上海作賣淫之勾當，她們常於報端登載「修指甲女郎」，或「按摩女郎」廣吿，雖然，警務當局屢設法禁絕彼等之活動，並對於本埠各英文報紙要求彼等在該種廣吿付刊之前，先予調查是吾眞確，吾則即不予登載，但她們仍甚活躍於市上。她們大都爲俄籍婦人，她們之友人並互爲鼓吹，謂可於某某時間前去光顧，並能達到某種之目的，她們之取費範圍由十元起至百元爲止。此種娼妓當然不會長時期保持淸潔的，因爲她們常是一顧客光顧她們，經一日夜而去，而另一顧客又接踵登門矣。因之，她們在全滬之男性白種人中傳播性病，而使上海之醫帥們永遠忙碌着診斷療疾病焉。（完　譯自大陸報）</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>取消日光節約時間</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>從十一月一日午夜起，取消日光節約時間，今天早晨，一定有許多家庭中，希望多睡一個鐘頭，因為丈夫或職業婦女上辦公室的時間，可以遲一個鐘點了。</p>
<p>其實　開在家庭中十分重要的，如果能夠每天早起，許多家事，可以更順利的辦理，使主婦可以從容不迫，有條不紊。</p>
<p>有一部份的主婦（我們希望這數目並不多）對於時間根本並不注重，她們睡得很晚，起得很遲，買菜燒飯，一切都由傭婦代勞，這些人的家庭，一定不會健全。</p>
<p>有許多做丈夫的男子，也是不守時間的，他們不能按時回家用飯，害得孩子們等待不及而睡着了，有許多家庭中的爭吵，是因爲丈夫不守時間而起的。</p>
<p>我以爲如果我們能够充分利用我們一生所有的時間，每一分錡所做的事都有意義，每一分鐘時間的過去，都是我們中心所快慰的話，人生將更有意義而更爲美麗了。</p>
<p>我的家庭問題</p>
<h3>我畏懼結婚</h3>
<p>— 振子</p>
<p>因為生理上的關係，和頻年漂泊的經騐，需要結婚來慰籍了。</p>
<p>結婚椒甜蜜的，不過當我每想到結婚及婚後狀况的時候，便有一重陰慘的氣氛把甜蜜驅走；如此，讓成了我畏懼結婚的心理。</p>
<p>對象不滿意嗎？不，她雖非一個出衆的女子，但與我却是很相當的。她比我小二歲，初中程度。她不是前進的職業婦女界裏一員，相反的，她正是廚房裏的能手呢！她雖不能經濟獨立，但我不能說她是我的附屬品。即使她踏進社會去服務，得失也未必能够相償，所以我也不怨恨她的落伍了。</p>
<p>婚費，生活費，子女敎育費……一連串的打向我的心頭，在這不合理的，畸形發展的社會裏，經濟問題差不多已成爲每個薪水階級的最大疾苦，和一般人畏懼結婚的重要因素，叉何必我多來饒古呢。有人說，貧賤夫妻不更比拜金主義下的婚姻有意義嗎！這或許是一種可以成爲事實的理想，我企禱着。</p>
<p>不過，無論如何，都不能使我畏懼結婚的心理消除，原因是我的職業生活根本就小適宜於結婚，它會把美滿的婚姻打破得粉碎，何况我們的婚姻，在其他的條件下，並未占到相當的優勢，怎受得住這無情的巨掌一擊呢？</p>
<p>我是一個紗廠職員，紗廠的機械是日夜不停的，人究竟不是機械，必須要兩班簪換，日班由早晨六時到下午六時，夜班由下午六時到翌晨六時，加上吃飯，走路，大便等私事，足足花了十五小時，餘下的時間，睡眠猶恐不足，家庭之中縱有無限的幸福，又何從享受起呢？而且，日夜班是每星期一輪流的，當做日工的時候，淸晨四五點鐘便要進廠「辜負香衾，」前人有例在先，鄙人也不敢多說；不渦常做夜工的時候，「日出而息，」難道也叫老婆陪我過這顚倒黑白的生活不成？</p>
<p>愛情亦如植物的種子一樣，它能在適宜的環境下滋長着，也會因着在風暴雨而被摧殘的。</p>
<p>我畏懼這不幸事實的降臨我畏懼結婚！（酬稿費十元家庭月刋全年）</p>
<p>編者按振先生畏懼結婚的理由，我以　爲倒是經　問題比較重要，因爲換班而使「日入而作」日出而息「並不是十分嚴重的問題，難道新聞記者的家庭，個個都是不美滿的嗎。結婚是一種藝術，全在乎當局者怎樣處置，時間的顚倒是不會影響夫婦的情感的。</p>
<p>我以爲一個有了職業的人，應該從事修養，充實自己，因爲經濟問題唯有努力進取，方纔可以得到合汕的解決。請別說沒有時開，每天即使費上十五分鐘的時間去看書，有一年的功夫，也可以有很可觀的成績。</p>
<p>如果振子先生的年齡在三十以下，那未即使等待若干時候，也並無不可。</p>
<p>下期微文揭曉：拖油瓶</p>
<h3>安全第一</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>家庭中有許多意外的事件，都是可以避免的，這裏的二十種，事件可以很容易的辦到。防止意外事件的發生</p>
<p>不要把箱子或盒子當做梯子　，立在上面是很危險的。</p>
<p>不要把玩具或別種東西，隨　便放在樓梯上。</p>
<p>不要把地毯放在太滑的地板上。</p>
<p>如果窗口太低，應該用鐵絲　或欄杆保護起來。</p>
<p>不要將火柴放在孩子拿得到的地方。</p>
<p>不要把鍋子放在爐子上面的時候任憑鍋柄向外。</p>
<p>不要用火油或別種易燃燒的東西作爲淸潔品。</p>
<p>火爐旁邊，應設有保護的東西。</p>
<p>不要在床上吸烟。</p>
<p>不要用潮濕的手去接觸有電氣的東西。</p>
<p>不要在洗澡的時候，把孩子放在浴缸裹，自己走到房外去。</p>
<p>不要使刀或其他鋒利的東西，被孩子接觸。</p>
<p>不要使小孩穿了尖銳的東西跑路。</p>
<p>不要把用過的藥水，隨便放置。</p>
<p>不要把消毒或殺蟲藥水，放在孩子拿得到的地方。</p>
<p>不要使廢碎紙散失，應該整理起來。</p>
<h3>怎樣處置傷風？</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>在這個天氣不時變更的時候，最容易傷風，因此傷風的預防和洽療，實在是當務之急。如果你已經受到傷風的襲擊，那末第一件事是把喉部胸部，保持溫暖，用一條輕軟的圍巾，是很好的辦法。每天用冷水嗽口一二决，在一玻璃盃的冷水裹放上半茶匙鹽，因爲冷水可以增加黏膜的抵抗力，鹽具有殺菌消毒的功效。</p>
<p>日光也是幫助增加抵抗力的要素，所以每天應該呼吸許多新鮮的空氣，享受許多的日光。我們平均一個人每天所喝的水太少，每天喝八杯開水，是很適當的，可以使身體裏的毒質，排除體外。</p>
<p>根據醫學家的研究　煩惱和工作過度，都是傷風的起因之一，所以要防止傷風，每天不能過分勞動，須有八小時的充足睡眠。但是萬一有熱度或喉痛的情形發生，那末就應該請醫生診治了。</p>
<h3>家事一得</h3>
<p>— 竺迅</p>
<p>在擦皮鞋時，皮鞋油中加入醋或醋酸一二滴，可使鞋上光彩更鮮明，更持久。檸檬汁有化骨能力的酸素，所以當吃魚時，若魚骨鯁喉，以檸檬汁吞下即消，如無檸檬，可以向西藥房內買檸檬酸溶化亦可。</p>
<p>如將鷄蛋埋藏於置有食鹽的木箱裏，箱底開孔若干，上敷厚紙，可以經久不壞。如於敷面粉前，先以檸檬汁擦面，可使皮膚更嫩，更清潔柔軟，如以乳汁代替，有同樣效若果以。甘油一小匙，混入十倍水，於人浴時，傾人浴盆中，則洗浴時感到舒適異常，能療疲乏勞苦。</p>
<p>如皮膚灼傷或手足面部有裂開，可以甘油塗在裂開部分，即能迅速痊愈。</p>
<p>文旦核不可廢棄，如以沸水泡之，可代油膏，且富黏質，性能光滑柔潤，常以擦髮，即可以使頭髮烏光可鑑。</p>
<h3>一星期　家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>一個月來，所謂無腸公子的蟹要算是上海市上最出鋒頭的東西了。每一條衛要的街上，幾乎都有一二個當蟹的攤子，任是每隻碗口大的蟹，不管它是不是洋澄湖的淸水大蟹，索價至四五元之多，自有般闊先生闊太太來買，可是我們　　薪水階級中人，可就沒有這口福了。在我個人，對於所謂大煤蟹並沒有甚麽好感，剝了蟹肉蘸着醬醋吃，倒不如炒蟹粉較爲入味，而且也可以經濟不少。譬如吃大煤蟹，每隻非二三元不可，小的就不堪一吃，而吃炒蟹粉，那麽每元二隻小蟹，也可以剝剝了。你要是出元買叫隻小蟹，剝得淺碗蟹粉再加些蛋花和韮芽等在內，就可以分作兩碗，供日夜兩餐之需了，所以我在經濟立塲上提倡吃炒蟹粉，而不主張吃大煠蟹。</p>

<h3>願開倒車</h3>
<p>— 無爲</p>
<p>這是一句多麼沒有出息的話—願開倒車！俗語說：人窮氣短，短便是縮的意思。大凡個人到無法可想的時候，他的志氣便有「短縮」的可能了。</p>
<p>上海人又有一句土話叫做：「活活縮轉去」，意思是一個人雖則年齡增進，而一切思想行動，却是儘向後退，不合時宜，毫無長進。</p>
<p>誰願意「開倒車」？誰又希望「向後退」？但是在這樣的物價暴漲，生活奇窘之中，我們回想過去，緬懷旣往，覺得欲求「開倒車」而不得！</p>
<p>前天午夜，大家把鐘點撥回一小時，夏季時間從此吿別。若能推而廣之，大家從這一小時，一天，一星期，一月的開着倒車，老老實實的「活活縮轉去」，豈不大妙呢？</p>
<p>星期六（一日）崑山新粳每石一百九十八元；開倒車一天，星期五，每石一百九十一元；開倒車一星期，（十月二十六日）每石一百七十九元；開倒車一個月，（十月一0日）每石祇一百五十元了。</p>
<p>試問，在生活上，上海的市民有誰不願意開倒車的！</p>
<p>我們爲薪水階級的人請命，希望那班自命爲「時代前　」眼明手快，囤積居奇，投機操縱的大人先生們，顧念上海多敎「願開倒車」的小市民們，暫時做個「時代的落伍」者！</p>

<h3>拯民水火不惜犧牲　救火員的工作</h3>
<p>— 耕耘</p>
<p>「文不像謄錄生，武不像救火兵」，一救火鬼」的地位，在一般人的心目中，於這兩句俗語中也就可以想像得出了！救火會又名消防隊，在這裏做事的人，本來是應該稱爲救火員或消防員的，然而，人們偏不這樣喊，乃賜謚之曰「鬼」，「鬼」者幽靈也，是與人類隔絕的東西。</p>
<p>「救火鬼」的工作，並不像人們所想像的那末簡單，僅僅只是救火，同時亦算是救火會裏備用的一批苦力，救火車上裝置的撲火器具大小零件不下百十毽，這些器具和零件，每天必得一件一件的拆開，用軋斯靈，黃沙擦磨乾凈，耀眼生輝。洗車，洗地板，洗門窗，洗皮帶，一切零星繁重的工作，沒有一樣不是「救火鬼」們做，從朝至暮，辛辛苦苦很少有空閒的時候，假使你要一摸他們的手，你看！粗乾得簡直像樹皮。</p>
<p>火警鈴噹啷噹啷一響，不問在白晝，在深夜，在酷暑，在嚴冬，丟掉了一切，樓扶梯就來不及跑，由瀉庭柱（一根豎立的銅柱子，從樓頂一直貫穿到樓底，爲了火警時行動迅速，每個救火昌都抱着這根柱子滑下去）上瀉下來，飛也似的往救火車上爬，在接得火警報吿牛分鐘內車子必須離開會門；不迅速敏捷能行嗎？</p>
<p>救火猶如和敵人對壘，衝鋒陷陣一樣，挾着火鈎，斧頭，與龍頭，在濃烟裏，在烈燄裏，向裹衛，向火窟裏衝，說不定飛磚會擊開了頭，斷壁壓折了腿，然而他們並不怕犧牲！爲了保全人的財產與生命！</p>
<p>「自由」這兩個字在救火會裏似乎是失掉了意義。除了每一星期有一天規定的吿差」（白相）之外，平常一日到夜不准出會門一步，憑你有天大的事，不到這一天，就不讓你出去；假使你要是「戳皮漏」（私自外去）的話，一經察兌，那就毫不客氣的辦你的「大菜」嚴厲的處罰），從　親友疏遠出，嬌妻不常會面。</p>
<p>上海灘上不知怎的越見吃力就越不能賺錢；「救火鬼」當然也不能例外。但他們底工作，在社會意義上說起來終究是偉大的，「拯民於水火」別小觀了他們！（却酬）</p>
<h3>名醫束手</h3>
<p>— 錢</p>
<p>病人：慈悲的醫生！年來頭昏腦脹，叫肢無力，精神不振，，可有什麼特效藥治好我的病嗎？</p>
<p>名醫：（手按脈，觀望氣色）五臟六腑均無病態，只是營養缺少些。</p>

<h3>老闆與伙計的界限</h3>
<p>— 山嘯</p>
<p>前夜有個在××公司做小職員的親戚來看我，一坐下來就談着生活程度這樣高上去，一般薪水階級的人們怎樣過下去？他尤其是他這四五十塊薪水實在難以應付：穿衣零用……還有家裹的妻常常寫信來催錢。每月算起來總是虧空。但他如果有幾個本錢，不至於弄到現在這樣窘像今年春裏他會慫恿過他的一個有錢朋友，叫他買一張他公司裏的股票；然而那個朋友劃算了一下說：不合算，因爲存在銀行製也有四五厘利息，而且叉穩當。可是他願意貼他朋友到一分半，因爲股票上寫我那親戚的名字，到年終他藉此可以分得到一筆較豐的紅利，然而他那個有錢的朋友說：他的公司是專銷外國貨的，將來航路完全斷絕了，就沒有什麼賣了，沒有東西賣，股票還値錢嗎？何况現在什麼東西都可賺錢，何必要買這種呆板的股票呢？</p>
<p>我的那個親戚懊喪地繼續說：如果他那個朋友當時聽了他的話，以前二千塊的股票現在票値三千多，而日到年底分起花紅來祇少拿得到千把塊。但他沒有聽他的話，於是他怨艾到自己的命運不好了。</p>

<p>聽這幾句話，錢若默就知道事情有些不妙了，可是秋海棠倒還竭力忍耐着。</p>
<p>「蕭先生的話不錯，祇要你肯賞飯吃，什麼我都幹！」</p>
<p>「我先說塲面上，官中的一堂裏，人是早就齊啦！但要勉强加一個打大鑼或小鑼的，倒還可以想法，祇是工錢很少，每個月不過二上四塊錢。」蕭吉淸的話說到這裏，秋海棠和錢若默的心便不由同時一冷。「但據那個武行頭說，前天武行裹面倒是新走一個下手；吳老板也是科班出身，翻翻打打的玩意兒，大概總還來得。他們的份子，可就要比塲面大一些，再有我跟錢先生的面子，當然更可以比別人優待；要是能充下手的話，一個月四十二塊錢，萬一祇能充上手，那末三十四塊錢也是一定有的，不過……。」（二五二）</p>

<h3>Reports of U.S. Aid Arriving Before Japan Launches Military Action Against Yunnan; China Has Thorough Preparations at Yunnan-Vietnam Border, Attempt to Cut Off Burma Road Transport Doomed to Fail</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 2nd (Havas) – The issue of Japan increasing its troops in Vietnam has become the most concerning issue for both government officials and private individuals here. According to reliable sources, "Government officials deeply believe that Japan intends to launch military action against Yunnan before the massive amount of U.S. aid arrives, in order to cut off transport along the Burma Road. However, China has made full preparations for this." This point was recently confirmed by Jiang Jieshi's political advisor, Lattimore. Lattimore returned from Kunming the day before yesterday, stating that although he did not go to the Yunnan-Vietnam border, he learned that Japan is indeed preparing for action in Vietnam, while China has made thorough preparations. Chairman Long and the people of Yunnan are also determined to resist strongly. As for Japan's propaganda of the so-called Greater Asianism to the people of Yunnan, it will definitely be ineffective. Furthermore, according to the observations of a certain foreign diplomat, Japan would need to use a large number of troops to attack Yunnan, and it would definitely require a large number of aircraft. However, the troops currently across the border are far from sufficient for this, and there are even fewer aircraft. Therefore, there is no possibility of launching an attack at present. If we add the treacherous terrain, deadly miasma, and the fact that Japan has not yet abandoned negotiations with the United States, it is doubtful whether we can launch this offensive.</p>
<p>London, 2nd (Reuters) – A special Reuters dispatch states that attention has been drawn here to the news spread by the German news agency Manira that Japan may be preparing to launch a serious attack on Thailand. It is believed that the denial by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai is deliberate and that the intention of this move seems to be to divert attention to cover up the possibility that Japan will launch an offensive against Yunnan Province in China. It is said that although the main supply line for Burma passes through Yunnan cities, there is another route that bypasses that area and goes through Chengdu to Jiading. This route has been under preparation for some time, and even if it is not yet open to traffic, it must be nearing completion. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about the future of Chinese military supplies.</p>
<p>Negotiations All Fail; Tensions Rise Between U.S. and Japan</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Havas) – A Columbia Broadcasting System announcer, when reporting on the current situation yesterday, strongly stated that political and diplomatic figures in Washington generally believe that tensions between the U.S. and Japan have become increasingly serious. It was also said that the recent rumors that the U.S. was negotiating with China and Britain to hand over Hong Kong and Singapore in Britain and four Chinese bases to the U.S. for use had aroused serious opposition from Japan. At the same time, various newspapers also portrayed the situation as serious, even predicting that U.S.-Japan relations would become acute in two weeks. The Minsheng Forum newspaper stated that the Japanese ambassador Nomura, in view of the ineffectiveness of all past efforts to promote U.S.-Japan friendship, is quite inclined to return to his country for a visit. The Times stated that since the U.S. should not make concessions to Japan, it is expected that Japan will soon take desperate measures. This pessimistic tone has been confirmed by frequent reports from Shanghai of Japanese troops concentrating in South China and North Vietnam.</p>
<p>The United Press, Washington, 2nd – Nazi Germany's accusation that the United States has attacked German submarines and begun a shooting war against Germany appears to be an attempt to invoke the Tripartite Pact. Diplomatic observers here believe that Japan, since joining the Axis Powers, is now undergoing the most serious test of its relationship with the Axis and democratic countries. Japan's international relations will become even more strained after the United States amends the Neutrality Act to allow American ships to enter war zones, as this move will enable a powerful American fleet to immediately join forces with the British fleet in the Atlantic and elsewhere, confronting Hitler with the most powerful enemy he has faced on the high seas since the start of the war. It is believed that Hitler wants to divert American attention to the Pacific and will try his best to get Japan to strike at the United States, thereby causing a U.S.-Japan crisis or conflict to weaken American intervention in the Atlantic. It is believed that the U.S. Navy will, to the extent possible, redeploy its forces in the Pacific, but will still maintain its main striking force in the Pacific in preparation for any Japanese action. At the same time, State Department officials, in commenting on Germany's accusation that the United States has begun a shooting war, declared that President Roosevelt's statement has clearly clarified the attitude of the United States. They stated that the German propagandists are clearly attempting to make countries that believe they are at risk of being attacked believe that they have the right to self-defense.</p>
<p>Germany Woos Japan to Launch War Against the U.S.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (United Press) – Unofficial sources here said yesterday that Nazi Germany's formal accusation that the United States has already begun an elbow-striking war against Germany by directly shooting at German submarines is actually a prelude to Germany's attempt to invoke the Tripartite Pact to drag Japan and Italy into an active war. The German claim that the U.S. destroyer "Kearny" first attacked a German submarine is tantamount to saying "the U.S. has attacked Germany" and indicates that Nazi officials are referring to Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact. It is widely believed that neither Italy nor Japan will react immediately, and it is believed that Italy is more likely to react than Japan, as Japan will carefully study who the aggressor is. According to the provisions of the Tripartite Pact, if any signatory is attacked by a third country that was not at war when the pact was signed, the other signatories shall come to the aid of the signatory under attack. However, each country has the right to determine which country initiated the aggression.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 2nd (Havas) – The diplomatic reporter of the Central Daily News, in the "International Weekly Review" column today, commented on the sinking of the Robin Moor incident, saying that in terms of the European situation, Germany currently has no need to attack the United States, nor is it necessary to retaliate because the United States has abolished the Neutrality Act. Therefore, the reason why it took this provocative action to drag the United States into the war is solely to reduce the threat of the U.S. Navy in the Pacific to Japan, so that it can feel at ease in taking action in the Far East. For a year, Germany has consistently failed to woo Japan, considering it a difficult task. Now, with the greatest determination, it has taken this last resort. However, Japan is still trying to gain without war, so it constantly threatens the U.S. and the Soviet Union to break up the U.S.-Soviet alliance in the Pacific, force the Soviet Union to resolve the so-called outstanding issues, and hope that the U.S. will allow it to obtain oil in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>U.S. Destroyer Sunk; Many Believe the U.S. Will Join the War</p>
<p>Manila, 2nd (Reuters) – The U.S. Army and Navy are greatly angered by the news of the sinking of the Robin Moor, and the Navy is eager to try. This has become an open secret. The American military and civilians in the Philippines now believe that the U.S. participation in the war is inevitable, only asking when the U.S. will join the war. The news of the sinking of the Robin Moor arrived too late, so most newspapers did not have time to publish criticisms this morning. However, all newspapers published this news as a major event. The Philippine Mabuhay, the only Filipino newspaper, said that Hitler has clearly declared war on the U.S., but unfortunately, the feelings and opinions of the American people are still not unified at this critical moment. Americans are only talking, while Germany is already shooting.</p>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Reuters) – According to general opinion, the sinking of the U.S. destroyer Reuben James will cause some doubtful votes in the struggle for the amendment to the Neutrality Act to vote for the government side, because if they vote against it, it would seem to appease Hitler, who has now sunk an American ship. The diplomatic reporter of the Scripps newspapers holds this view and says that foreign envoys in Washington believe that after the Reuben James, there will inevitably be other ships that will suffer the same fate, forcing Congress to declare war. The U.S. and Germany are currently at war, just like China and Japan.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Berlin, 2nd – Yesterday, Chief Hitler strongly refuted President Roosevelt's Navy Day speech and pointed out that the U.S. wanted to use the destroyer's attack on German submarines to make the U.S. and Germany fall into a "real shooting war." According to Hitler, the documents mentioned by Roosevelt, which were used to show that Germany was trying to divide South America and abolish world religions, "are all forgeries." Hitler said, "The U.S. destroyers Greer and Kearny attacked German submarines before being hit by torpedoes. At this time, the shooting war had already begun. As for the map of South America and the German plan to abolish religion mentioned in President Roosevelt's speech, they were planned by countries other than Germany. The German government has notified all neutral countries, including those in Central and South America, that these documents are all forged." Hitler's remarks were made yesterday at the Eastern Front headquarters, and foreign journalists were also briefed at a special meeting for journalists in Berlin.</p>
<p>Japan Temporarily Refuses to Criticize Germany's Declaration</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (United Press) – The Cabinet Information Bureau today refused to criticize Germany's declaration that the United States has begun a shooting war against Germany because its destroyers attacked German submarines, saying that it would not make any criticism until it received an official report. The Information Bureau said, "We must carefully study the entire text," because this matter is very important. Therefore, "it is too early to rush to a criticism, especially regarding Japan's obligations under the Tripartite Pact." Observers say the Japanese people seem prepared to accept Germany's declaration, as Navy Secretary Knox and other U.S. officials have publicly stated that the destroyer "Kearny" dropped depth charges before being attacked by a Nazi submarine. The Japanese people will consider this an American aggression against Germany, but they also say Japan's obligations to Germany under the Tripartite Pact remain unaffected.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Reuters) – The Japanese News Agency published an article expressing Japan's thoughts on the international situation and declaring that Japan is prepared to deal with any situation. According to reliable observers, the increase in taxes and the rise in prices are the forces behind Tojo's completion of Japan's wartime preparations. Tojo does not rely on the U.S. to resolve the current difficulties, so he wants to seek the understanding of the public from the Diet. If the situation is allowed to change naturally, it will inevitably become worse. The solution depends entirely on the removal of the U.S. economic pressure on Japan. Foreign Minister Togo originally planned to leave Tokyo at the end of the week to visit the imperial tomb and shrines to report on his duties, but now he has postponed the trip, which is quite significant.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Unanimously Criticize the U.S.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (United Press) – Tokyo Japanese newspapers today generally joined the Mainichi Shimbun and the Domei News Agency in attacking the U.S., saying that U.S.-Japan relations have now reached their worst point. The newspapers said that Japan can no longer allow the negotiations in Washington to continue to stall. The newspapers said that the only way to break the deadlock in U.S.-Japan relations is for the U.S. to stop its pressure on Japan, especially its economic pressure. The Chugai Commercial Shimbun said that although Japan has done its best to maintain peace in the Pacific, it cannot abandon its right to survive for the sake of peace in the Pacific and the world. The time to take action to protect this survival is gradually approaching. The Asahi Shimbun said that the U.S. underestimates Japan's strength and that the U.S.'s selfish policy in Tokyo is the greatest danger in the Pacific crisis.</p>
<p>British Opinion Generally Advocates Helping the U.S. Fight Japan</p>
<p>London – The British reaction to Prime Minister Tojo's speech is now one of firm, sarcastic, and angry attitudes. The Daily Telegraph's editorial is the sharpest rebuttal to Tojo's speech. Tojo said that Japan's mission to resolve the "China Incident" and establish the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is its greatest honor. The newspaper refuted this by saying, "Who authorized Japan to undertake the mission of slaughtering and robbing? Neither God nor mankind would authorize Japan to do so." Regarding Tojo's threat that the U.S. must make concessions to Japan by November 15, otherwise Japan will reaffirm its commitment to the Tripartite Pact and the Anti-Comintern Pact, qualified observers in Britain said that the U.S.'s condition is that Japan completely abandon its aggressive and expansionist behavior; otherwise, a conflict between the two sides cannot be avoided. Navy Secretary Knox has also issued this warning. If a shooting war does break out in the Pacific, Britain will not hesitate to help the U.S. fight. The British and American navies will form a two-ocean fleet. Observers also said that American public opinion supports going to war against Japan, and British public opinion also hates Japan's repeated threats and extortion. Therefore, British newspapers are currently maintaining a firm and consistent stance in resisting further Japanese aggression. (1st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Taiyo Maru Arrives in Honolulu to Evacuate Nationals; War Between Japan and the U.S. Unlikely to Happen Soon</h3>
<p>Honolulu, 2nd (United Press) – The Japanese ship "Taiyo Maru" arrived here yesterday from Japan, carrying 345 evacuating nationals. This move leads authorities here to believe that although anti-American movements are intense in Japan, it seems unlikely for the time being that any action that would involve the country in a war with the U.S. will be launched. The "Taiyo Maru" is scheduled to return to Tokyo after November 4, while the "Tatuta Maru" will leave the U.S. today. It is widely believed that Japan is unlikely to take any action while these two Japanese ships are within the range of U.S. air power. Among the passengers on the "Taiyo Maru," 15 were Americans, one was British, and the rest were Japanese. Most of the Americans on the "Taiyo Maru" were missionaries who had lived in Japan for a long time. According to Mr. Yamaguchi, a Japanese-American who was born in Honolulu and is a deputy prosecutor, "The Japanese people are tired of the war with China and do not want to continue it. However, they believe that land reclamation is the only way out due to economic pressure." According to Mr. Yamaguchi, he worked for a certain insurance company in Japan last year.</p>
<h3>Demarcation of Manchuria and Mongolia Completed</h3>
<p>Kuybyshev, 2nd (Reuters) – Soviet spokesman Lozovsky announced here today previously unreleased news that the Mixed Committee for the Demarcation of Manchuria and Mongolia has completed its work and signed an agreement. The committee has left Harbin. It is said that the border between the two sides has now been clearly demarcated in an area 16 miles long between Buinor and Kalkin Gol. Kuybyshev, 2nd (Reuters) – Soviet government spokesman Lozovsky declined to criticize the formation of the new Japanese government, saying he would wait and see how it acted. Lozovsky also said the Soviet government hopes that the recent Soviet-Japanese incident on the Amur River was solely an action by local troops and that Tokyo would punish them.</p>
<h3>It is Rumored That the U.S. Ship That Was Torpedoed Had Sunk German Ships</h3>
<p>Danville, U.S., 2nd (Reuters) – According to a letter sent by sailor Dickinson to his friends here last week, the U.S. destroyer Reuben James, which was torpedoed and sunk west of Iceland on the night of October 30, had sunk two German submarines and may have sunk other submarines.</p>

<h3>Actively Building Chongqing; New Buildings Increase; City Situation More Prosperous Than in Summer; However, Housing Problems Remain Serious</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Chongqing has not been attacked for many days since being attacked in the summer. Contractors, carpenters, masons, and thatch roofers are all very busy repairing or building houses in preparation for the winter. Many shops have opened during the summer, and merchants have moved goods back into the city that were stored in safe places in the countryside during the summer. The city situation has been hindered by the rapid rise in prices. In areas that were targeted during the bombing season, such as the British Embassy, the Press Association, and many commercial streets, new buildings have now appeared. What is strange is that there are now more thatched roofs than tiled roofs, and even some well-built brick houses also have thatched roofs.

<h3>Xi'an Eastern Suburbs: Discovery of Hidden Gold – Totaling 640 Taels –</h3>
<p>Xi'an. Guangxu in Changlefang, outside the eastern gate of Xi'an, was originally the site of the Tang Dynasty ruins. Over the years, it has become a public burial ground, with countless coffins buried there. On the 27th of last month, around noon, citizens Guo Yonglu and others carried a coffin to the site for burial. While digging five feet deep, they discovered an iron box covered in rust, containing gold dust of varying sizes. The local police took the iron box and its contents to the station for examination. It was found to contain a total of 640 taels of gold, seven taels of rust, and the iron box weighed over ninety market catties. The police station has already reported this to the provincial government, intending to offer it to the central government. According to experts familiar with Chang'an's ancient sites, the location where the gold was discovered is the former site of the Tang Dynasty's Xingqing Palace.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Cancer of the Pacific</h3>
<p>Even after the change of the Japanese cabinet, the exploratory talks between the United States and Japan have not been interrupted. Until recently, the contact between the two sides has continued to be maintained. Those who regard the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet as Japan's continued adherence to a prudent route seem to have obtained a factual proof in this regard. However, even if the talks have not been interrupted, hope has become increasingly weak. To this day, there is no room for opinions appeasing Japan, and no one dares to be optimistic about the future of this talk. Therefore, public opinion in Japan has turned to another extreme of pessimism. After the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet, it was decided to convene a special Diet in mid-month. It is said that the Japanese spokesman in Washington once stated that a dangerous situation may occur after the Japanese Diet convenes on the 15th of this month, and Japanese newspapers have also stated that US-Japan relations will become acute in two weeks. This cancer of the Pacific, truly, has reached the stage of festering, and it is a problem that should be given serious attention.</p>
<p>Examining the main cause of the formation of this cancer is Japan's attempt to establish a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and what has contributed to the development of this cancer is the advantage created by the Axis countries in the European war. Therefore, even though the idea of "New Order" and "Co-Prosperity Sphere" was put forward by Konoe three years ago, its actual threat was created after the defeat of Britain and France last summer. Recently, as the Nazis made a desperate effort to make progress in the battles around Moscow and the Don River basin, the situation in the Pacific has suddenly become tense. If the Nazis' military strength and power had not always been a major threat to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the Far East issue would not have been so difficult. The US authorities have always regarded the annihilation of the Nazis as the first priority, and from this point of view, there is considerable reason for this. However, the outbreak of the Far East Incident was far earlier than the Nazis' seizure of power. The Axis's aggressive actions undoubtedly learned a model from the Far East. Therefore, even if the threat of the Nazis is lifted, it will certainly help the future of the Far East situation, but the crisis in the Pacific cannot be fundamentally eliminated because of this. The ambiguous attitude of the Tripartite Pact and the fact that the US-Japan talks can continue to this day are all based on this reason. The response to the crisis in the Far East must be made with effective considerations in addition to the development of the European war.</p>
<p>The first thing that needs to be confirmed is the basis of Japan's expansionist attempt. Everyone knows that Japan is still waiting—waiting for a more favorable opportunity. If the Nazis defeat the Soviet Union and the attention of Britain and the United States is drawn to the dangerous waves of the Atlantic, then in the eyes of some people, the overall situation in the Far East will naturally be isolated, and the southward and northward advances will be suitable for everything. However, the convenience that opportunity can provide is only half the effort, and it is by no means an absolute gain without labor. In any case, it will still be necessary to pay the lowest possible capital and price. Unless this capital has been completely exhausted, the delusion of expansion will not be subdued. Four years of hard fighting have certainly caused considerable fatigue, but it is also because of being in war for a long time that the whole country can gradually conform to the wartime system. The formation of a combat mechanism allows it to strengthen and intensify a high degree of wartime system in the past year, and it is not an empty word. The peaceful industry has shrunk unprecedentedly, but it has greatly increased military production. Although it cannot get a sufficient supply of resources under economic sanctions, its efforts to search for it are not without success. The strength after a long war, even if others think it is vulnerable, it may not be self-confident that it can still try. What's more, in recent years, the results of its naval and air force expansion have always been kept secret. Even if it may not have amazing miracles, focusing on building the military is by no means without results. Therefore, the so-called completion of the combat mechanism, whether we still want to discount it, it should be confirmed that this is the root cause of the Far East crisis. The arms race among the great powers a few years ago proved that they would inevitably be involved in the war sooner or later. If a person is indeed tightening his belt to exchange for cannons, no one will believe that he will only use weapons as a means of showing off his power in hunger.</p>
<p>The repeated delays in the Far East crisis do not mean that it will not eventually erupt, but only that one side is delaying waiting for an opportunity to seek greater strength, and the other side is conducting tests to see if those who uphold justice can be deceived by their side. The US-Japan negotiations in the past two months have been time-consuming and harmful, and have been criticized by the world, but they are not without gain. At least they have proved that the United States strictly adheres to its consistent position and does not allow interference. Whether it is to use sweet words or intimidation, it is not enough to change its determined attitude. This situation is not enough to eliminate the Pacific crisis, at least it has made those who want to be lucky understand the seriousness of the situation. If they must seek the satisfaction of greed, they must pay the little remaining capital. This situation naturally does not allow negligence, and this is the reason why a seemingly gentle and prudent regime can be produced. As for what is hidden inside this gentle cloak, it is to enrich the wartime system to the maximum extent. The convocation of the Provisional Diet is probably of greater significance internally than externally. The so-called dangerous situation that may occur after the 15th is still mostly intimidation, and naturally things like attacking the Yunnan-Burma Road may happen at any time.</p>
<p>Today's South Pacific is naturally not as exposed as it was before, but in terms of response, it is undeniable that it is not strong enough. Therefore, it is still not enough to contain the outbreak of unexpected chaos. There is naturally no doubt about the future outcome, but we should seek to reduce the scope of the disaster and increase efficiency. Now that it is full of gunpowder everywhere, if a spark is found, it must be extinguished immediately. Once it spreads, everything will be very troublesome.</p>
<h3>Thailand Desperately Wants to Maintain Neutrality Under Japanese Overt Threats to Avoid Provoking Japanese Hostile Actions Against Thailand. Thailand's Only Guarantee is British and American Aid.</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd. Sheehan, a New York correspondent, broadcast from Yangon, saying that Thailand's current position is that Thailand is currently under overt threat from Japanese military action. Thailand is extremely unwilling to give the Japanese side an excuse for hostile actions, so it maintains extremely strict neutrality, like Belgium and the Netherlands in the past. Now, there is only one shelter to defend against aggressors, that is, the British government's war efforts are supported by the United States. A spokesman for the Thai government praised this broadcast last night, saying that it was very fair and objectively and sympathetically disclosed the feelings in Thailand. This is a good contribution that a foreign journalist can make in his position. He was unwilling to criticize Sheehan's expectation that Japan might advance into Thailand, but felt that Sheehan had explained the spirit of Thailand to neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 2nd. The Thai Minister of Economy yesterday submitted two bills to the National Assembly to increase the national tax on tin and tungsten production in Thailand. These two cases have been passed at the first reading. The national tax on tin sand will increase from three baht to five baht per load (approximately half a pound in British gold). The national tax on tungsten sand will increase from 10% to between 11% and 12% based on the Bangkok market price. The Minister of Economy said that the tungsten sand business is still good, and that Thai tungsten sand is priced higher than that in the Straits Settlements. Mr. Dole, a British financial advisor to the Thai government, reviewed Thailand's budget and general financial situation over the past two years, saying that the scope of Thailand's finances is indeed not very large, but its position today is no worse than other countries. The budget is balanced, and the balance of international debt is favorable to the Thai currency. Thailand's reserves reach 110%, of which gold accounts for more than 42%. What Thailand lacks is national capital, but the cooperative movement is now gradually taking effect.</p>
<h3>Japanese Veterans Association Holds Parade</h3>

<h3>The Beginning and End of Roosevelt and Churchill's Meeting in the Atlantic (1)</h3>
<p>US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill held a historic meeting somewhere in the North Atlantic in mid-August. The details of the meeting are described below with reference to British and American newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 16, 1941, in the damp and old dock reception room in Oakland Harbor, Maine, USA, there were fifty anxious and frustrated people, either sitting or standing. They were all news reporters, photographers, and wireless radio reporters. They had been waiting for a long time—two weeks in Swinscott, Massachusetts, and two days in Rockland.</p>
<p>The heavy fog that had enveloped the distance of Benos Scott Bay all day had gradually dissipated. At about 3 o'clock, the people on the dock glimpsed the President's yacht "Potomac," with its large head and comfortable body, appearing near the breakwater, and saw the naval patrol ship "California" guarding it back and forth.</p>
<p>At this time, the broadcasters used a series of excited tones to talk endlessly into the loudspeaker, and the police were also fully focused. The blue-gray "Potomac" slowly approached the dock, returning safely from the mysterious realm of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's departure from the White House this time, making a tour of more than tens of thousands of miles, lasted exactly thirteen days, most of which were not made public. People generally only knew that he was holding a mysterious meeting at sea.</p>
<p>When the yacht docked, the first thing the President did was announce that he would meet with reporters on the yacht. Beforehand, he had received a wireless report that the reporter group was waiting on the dock, so he sat quietly in the cabin, calm and happy. President's confidant Hopkins sat aside. The president lit a Camel cigarette and told the fat ones that there was no news to tell, only that Mr. Churchill had established a complete understanding in all aspects of the war. He also said that the Soviet Union could support the entire winter, and would continue to resist after receiving full assistance from the United States next spring, but the United States did not get closer to the war because of his trip.</p>
<p>When a New York Times reporter asked about the situation of the meeting at sea, the President said that he was very willing to talk about the impressions of this trip. The first was a grand service held on the quarterdeck of the British's newest battleship "Prince of Wales" on Sunday morning, with all the officers and men of the ship participating together. Two or three hundred sailors from the American cruiser "Augusta" sat with them, and their spirits were very harmonious. The service was led by pastors from the United States and Britain, but the sermon was given by the British captain to conform to naval customs.</p>
<p>Because the President was unable to walk, he and Prime Minister Churchill decided to hold the meeting alternately. In addition to holding a meeting on the British ship, the rest were held on the "Augusta." The President said that he had been with Churchill for more than a day, talking about the situation in all continents of the world. Every part of every level was talked about.</p>
<p>The President said that this meeting was jointly initiated by him and Churchill, and the motivation was in February of this year, but the scheduled meeting was postponed by three months due to the wars in Greece and Crete.</p>
<p>A reporter asked the President that the eight points of peace policy jointly announced by the President and Churchill did not mention how to destroy the "Nazi tyranny." The President replied that this view was too narrow. The main purpose of this meeting was to exchange various views on the present and the future.</p>
<p>Another reporter asked if he and Churchill had established a complete understanding in all aspects of the war. He replied: Yes, I think it is so.</p>
<p>Someone else asked: "Has the United States become closer to the war because of this?" The President said no. But reporters were not allowed to add quotation marks to this sentence as the President's own statement.</p>
<p>As for how the meeting between him and Churchill was completed, the President said that the two sides would further exchange opinions.</p>
<p>"Does the Soviet Union have to fulfill these eight principles?" a reporter asked. The President replied that no one had thought of this before the reporter asked, but it was mentioned in the meeting that the needs of the Soviet Union should be taken into account in the plan to build up arms.</p>
<p>This need is divided into two categories: one is various urgent military supplies to be transported to the Soviet Union before this winter, and the other is various military supplies for fighting next spring.</p>
<p>Someone asked the President if he had any doubts about the Soviet Union's determination to fight to the end. The President replied that he believed that the Soviet Union could fight to the end, based on what he had just said.</p>
<p>Finally, the President also said that he was slightly isolated from the recent situation in France and the Far East, but he would discuss it at length with Secretary of State Hull after returning to Washington tomorrow.</p>
<p>The yacht entered the port at 3 o'clock, and at 4 o'clock, the President and his party disembarked, took a car to the station, and took the 4:10 train back to the capital.</p>
<p>The cruiser "Augusta" of 9,050 tons, which President Roosevelt took to the meeting, was the warship of the original US Asian Fleet, and the people of Shanghai had seen it in the Huangpu River. Churchill took the newest battleship "Prince of Wales" of 35,000 tons. Both sides also had multiple escort ships, and their combined strength was enough to cope with any large-scale naval battle.</p>
<p>The gathering place for the ships was mostly Newfoundland in the North Atlantic, or in Plaza Saintia Bay, not far from the new large-scale US naval base under construction. The coastline there is rugged and the meeting period is in the fog season.</p>
<p>The meeting date was August 9th and 10th. First, Churchill, with a long cigar in his mouth, strode onto the "Augusta." He was wearing a dark blue naval uniform, and the eight copper buttons on his chest had been darkened by the ashes falling from his mouth. The ankle-length boots on his feet were originally making a clicking sound, but now they were only half audible. He first handed a letter to President Roosevelt and said hello: "Mr. President, it is an honor to greet you on behalf of His Majesty."</p>
<p>Roosevelt smiled and thanked him. The British Prime Minister was short and fat, with a curved back and a red face. He had a dog-like jaw, and a hat with a brim covered his sparse yellow hair. He stood with a charming smile, like a shy little angel, making people love him. The American head of state was tall and generous, with a stubborn jaw and thick shoulders leaning back. His head and neck were to one side, and he always did this when he came to new and important things.</p>
<p>This was just the situation of their first meeting on August 9th. They were already on a deeper level of friendship before they parted. The next day, Sunday, the "Augusta" approached the "Prince of Wales," and the President crossed the gangway to participate in the service. After that, the meeting was held on the "Augusta."</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of a certain meeting, the London Daily Mail recorded the conversation of an American official, which is as follows:</p>
<p>It is difficult to say who was more happy than the other between the President and Prime Minister Churchill during the various meetings. They had been talking on the Atlantic long-distance telephone for several months, and they knew each other deeply. So when they met, it was like old friends meeting again. After greeting each other, they started talking about various issues enthusiastically.</p>

<h3>American Isolationists Attack Neutrality Amendments</h3>
<p>Havas, New York, 1st. Navy Secretary Knox delivered a speech at the Marine Corps banquet today, stating that the United States will participate in this war to the end. United Press, Washington, 2nd. Isolationist leaders continued to attack the government's diplomatic policy yesterday, allowing the amendment of the Neutrality Act so that the government could arm merchant ships. However, the amendment is currently being considered by the Senate, and they have little hope of blocking it. Missouri Democratic Senator Clark said that once the Neutrality Act is amended, it will cause the world to suffer "unlimited" war. He opposed "sacrificing the blood of American youth" to participate in the war. He also denounced Navy Secretary Colonel Knox, saying that he "seems to have been bitten by a mad dog and arbitrarily announced a century-long alliance with Britain without the permission of the Constitution." He also said that if President Roosevelt believes that it is necessary to fight to protect the security of the United States, he can send a message to Congress to request a declaration of war. However, Minnesota Republican Senator Bauer said that if the proposal to amend the Neutrality Act is rejected, the United States may be at war alone on both oceans with the victorious Germany and Japan at the same time.</p>

<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Goes to the United States to Meet Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 2nd. Canadian Prime Minister King arrived here yesterday by special train from Ottawa. He told news reporters in the car that he came here to have a two-day meeting with President Roosevelt. It is also expected that the conversation will involve all events in the current situation related to the two countries. He thought that the two sides would talk about everything. When asked by a reporter if he expected to return to Canada with a complete understanding, King replied that a complete understanding already existed. At the same time, Princess Juliana of the Netherlands and her two children also arrived here by another special train.</p>
<p>United Press, Hyde Park, 2nd President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King began important talks on the continent and the Western Hemisphere yesterday, and later admitted that the two would review every issue in the international situation. According to some information, the two will also study economic and military events to make the wartime relationship between the United States and Canada closer. The public believes that this decision conference can be seen in the fact that the Canadian National Assembly will listen to the speech of Lord Attlee, the British Lord Privy Seal, when it is convened on Monday. King refused to comment on the US Navy, which is stationed in the North Atlantic, to guarantee the safety of Halifax Harbor, an important Canadian base, so that the British Navy can concentrate its attention on the Atlantic east of Iceland.</p>
<h3>Turkish President's Report on the International Situation</h3>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 2nd - Turkish President İsmet İnönü, in a report on the political situation during the Turkish parliament's reopening yesterday, stated that there is a risk of war spreading. Turkey's relations with belligerent nations are now restricted by new and old agreements since Turkey declared neutrality. All of these agreements are fully effective. Turkey's relationship with Germany was most difficult during the Balkan campaign. At that time, Hitler was deeply aware of our interests and concerns and personally sent a cordial letter to me expressing Germany's friendship towards our country. The Turkish government approved and I responded to Germany's reply, creating an atmosphere of trust, forming the basis for the German-Turkish agreement of June 18th. Since then, the development of Turkish-German relations has been very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Ankara, 2nd - Although Turkey is surrounded by belligerent nations, there is still hope for peace. Therefore, Turkish President General İsmet İnönü expressed yesterday his willingness to act as a mediator for belligerent countries. However, he also warned all nations that Turkey will still fight to protect its independence. General İnönü stated during the Turkish parliament session, "We will not succumb to military action under any circumstances." The president pointed out that Turkey will not allow any country, whether Britain or Germany, to occupy the country by military force. He also stated that Turkey's relationship with Germany is based on friendly relations, while its relationship with allied Britain is based on the Anglo-Turkish alliance.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of American Military Supplies Arrive in Turkey</h3>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 1st - Authoritative sources revealed yesterday that Britain has shipped "large quantities" of American military supplies to Turkey under the Lend-Lease program and has notified the US government. This news was initially revealed by the Turkish capital's radio station. It is claimed that American-made howitzers and other weapons were visible during a major review of the Turkish army. In response to inquiries, US authorities stated that large quantities of American vehicles have been shipped to Turkey. This move may indicate that if Turkey supports Britain and breaks with Germany, Turkey can rely on American assistance. Washington officials did not disclose the types and quantities of weapons shipped to Turkey due to military relations. However, it is understood that the administrator of the Lend-Lease program is currently compiling a detailed report on this matter. It is rumored that the first batch of American supply ships sailed to Turkey shortly after the fall of Greece. However, it is also rumored that Turkey already possesses sufficient British and French aircraft for use, so even if war breaks out in the Near East, there is no need for American aircraft assistance. At the same time, observers stated, "Large-scale military preparations are currently underway in the Near East." It is rumored that British forces are concentrating on preparing to establish a southern front against Germany in the spring. In addition, the railway lines in Iraq and Egypt are being repaired and improved to ensure sufficient supply lines when the war begins.</p>

Soviet motor torpedo boats sank three enemy ships and damaged another in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - A special German communiqué announced that Simferopol, the capital of Crimea, has been captured. The Soviets also admitted that the situation on the peninsula is very serious. It is reported that the German-Romanian allied forces are now advancing towards Sevastopol, 40 miles southwest of the city.

The Soviets anticipate that the fighting may intensify again at any time. In the Donets River basin, the Soviets are currently resisting the Nazi advance towards Rostov and have reportedly made some progress. German propaganda claims to have occupied some industrial areas, but German troops are encountering great difficulties in the waterlogged areas north of the mouth of the Don River. Today's German communiqué did not mention the fighting on the Moscow front. However, Moscow radio stated that the calm atmosphere in that area over the past few days will soon be broken. It is reported that large numbers of German reserves are concentrated in the Volokolamsk and Kalinin areas. The Soviet army is vigorously resisting the Nazi attacks on Tula. According to a reporter from Red Star, the most dangerous point in the Moscow war at present is in the Tula and Kalinin areas. The fighting in the Tula area continued day and night on Saturday and Sunday. Although the Germans suffered heavy losses, their offensive has not weakened. The Soviets have been forced to retreat after repelling the main German force. In other areas of the Moscow front, such as Mozhaisk and Volokolamsk, the Soviet positions have been strengthened, and repeated local counterattacks have also been successful. German troops around Leningrad are very anxious about the issue of supplies. The Soviet Union has obtained the truth from prisoners of war, knowing that German soldiers lack clothing. The German trenches are wet and cold, and the soldiers are terrified of the approaching winter. According to a supplementary communiqué released by the Soviet side, a Soviet regiment annihilated a German infantry company in yesterday's fighting, destroyed multiple flat-trajectory guns, and captured a large number of machine guns and bullets. In addition, the Soviet air force, active on the southern front, bombed and destroyed 16 German tanks and 100 trucks, and killed 700 infantrymen.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 2nd - The fighting on the outer lines of Moscow continues, with the three regions of Tula, Kalinin, and Volokolamsk being the most intense. The two armies are advancing and retreating against each other. The fate of Moscow depends entirely on the outcome of this battle. German troops are actively reinforcing, attempting to take the city in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Associated Press, London, 2nd - Reports from yesterday morning indicate that German troops are reinforcing their attacks on Kalinin to the north of Moscow and Tula, 120 miles south of Moscow. It is expected that the German army will launch a larger new attack, as they are strengthening their reinforcements, hoping to capture the city before winter arrives.</p>
<p>TASS, Northern Front, 2nd - A TASS correspondent stated that Soviet border troops achieved great success in fighting at a certain point. They penetrated deep into the enemy lines, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Our army was very successful in its night attacks. The night before last, Suikov's troops penetrated deep behind enemy lines and fought with the enemy for three hours. As a result, the German side suffered 200 casualties. Our army also destroyed five enemy aircraft, two anti-aircraft guns, and one radio station.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Has Abundant Production. There Is No Need To Worry About A Protracted War.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - Moscow Radio relayed yesterday's discussion in the Red Star newspaper, stating that Hitler now wants to end the war as soon as possible, but we are the ones who have the ability to end the war. The further the German army advances, the more resistance centers it will encounter. This resistance has new sources of supply constantly replenished, and this replenishment is as inexhaustible as Soviet manpower. We will achieve the complete collapse of the enemy at any cost. We have just begun to develop domestic resources. Siberia has unlimited prospects. The Urals have become a prosperous and powerful industrial center, with several of Europe's largest arsenals. Siberia produces huge amounts of coal, Gagar Kekantan produces various metals, and Altai is also preparing to develop its vast resources with newly arrived workers. The loss of industry in the western regions of the Soviet Union only means that work is intensified tenfold in areas that the enemy cannot reach. Although the Germans have gained something, their position is not as stable as before, because what the Germans have seized are not industrial towns, but scorched earth and flooded land. Soviet factories that have been moved to the east have now begun their new production, and in many cases, the quantities are even greater than before. Germany is worried about the prolongation of the war, so the German authorities have to make statements that the German army has completely occupied the fertile areas of the Soviet Union and that the Soviet Union is poor outside of Moscow to comfort their people.</p>
<p>After Retreating From Various Cities, The Soviets Scorched The Earth, And The Germans Gained Nothing.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 1st - "The People of Rome" recently published a dispatch from a German-Soviet war correspondent stating that all the Soviet towns occupied by the German army have been set ablaze by the Red Army before retreating. For example, Lviv, Berdichev, Nikolaev, and Kyiv have all become scorched earth and there is nothing left. "The Fascist Political System News" also carried a dispatch from a special reporter stating that five days before the German army occupied the city of Kyiv, ordinary people could not have imagined that the city would soon fall. But on September 22nd, the sound of destruction and explosions began to be heard incessantly. Three hours later, all types of buildings and important streets were destroyed by explosions, and the fire spread throughout the entire city.</p>
<p>Truth Daily Urges Soviet Citizens To Intensify Activities To Strike At The Nazis.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 2nd - Yesterday, Truth Daily wrote, "The war has entered its fifth month, and the enemy has lost confidence in victory. The date for settling accounts with the dead Soviet patriots is near. Compatriots in Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Galicia, and all occupied areas, quickly organize guerrilla units and destroy the fascist villains. A temporary victory will not help Hitler. Fascism will be destroyed. The front has received all necessary assistance. Mechanics, working men and women, and technicians, quickly manufacture more aircraft, tanks, artillery, and small cannons. Collective farmers, the fascists want to seize your assets and enslave you, quickly harvest more food to help the front. We will quickly help the front with everything."</p>
<p>TASS, Battlefield Report, 2nd - Recently, the German fascist troops have intensified their offensive towards Crimea. Our army, in addition to resisting bravely, has also launched counterattacks, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The fighting at the bridgehead is very fierce. Our army has recaptured the bridgehead and two high grounds, and three villages, annihilating two battalions of enemy infantry.</p>

<h3>Iranian King Reiterates Compliance With Anglo-Iranian Treaty</h3>
<p>Reuters, 2nd, Badreh - During yesterday's meeting of the Iranian parliament, the King's representative gave a speech reiterating the promise to fulfill the Anglo-Iranian treaty, stating that this policy has the unanimous support of the Iranian people and has always been followed by the various Iranian cabinets, and is supported by the most progressive Arab nations. Britain's explicit promise to assist the Arab nations who have not yet gained their independence shows its goodwill, and the King expresses his gratitude to this allied country. He expressed his gratitude to Britain, America, Egypt, Hejaz, and Outer Jordan for their friendly and noble attitude towards Iran when Iran faced difficulties. He then spoke of the troubles of the upper classes, saying that fortunately, they were quelled before causing great harm to the country. The government will adopt a strict attitude towards those who violate the constitution and national discipline. The government now aims to strengthen the army in terms of equipment and discipline, and wants to eliminate various reasons that use the army as a tool, making it unable to fulfill its duties in defending the country. According to the provisions of the Anglo-Iranian treaty, Iran should assist Britain in all important aspects during wartime.</p>
<h3>Italian Military Industry Increases Capital</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Rome, 2nd - The cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini, decided yesterday to increase the capital of the military industry in order to cope with Italy's increased war work and various issues. The cabinet meeting, convened at the Venice residence, authorized a tenfold increase in loans to the military industry, including the Breda factory, which manufactures aircraft, tanks, and vehicles, the Pirelli rubber factory, the Montecatini chemical factory, and the Ilva steel factory. At the same time, food auditor and Minister of Agriculture Dassinari ordered all Italian pastures to be used for wheat planting in order to increase wheat supply to meet wartime needs. The government also intends to issue another order at the same time, increasing the price of salt used in industry and agriculture by 50% from November 1st. Salt is a state monopoly.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Imminent British Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Associated Press, London, 2nd - Member of Parliament Granville stated in a luncheon speech that he expects a reshuffle of the British cabinet, which will include Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook and Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax. He said that a cabinet reshuffle is currently considered inevitable, but what is surprising is that this reshuffle will include Lord Beaverbrook, Lord Halifax, and personnel from the Foreign Office. Prime Minister Churchill will make his cabinet a cabinet to win the war. Lord Beaverbrook and Labor Minister Bevin must reduce various other responsibilities in order to devote all their efforts to the war cabinet.</p>
<h3>German Planes Attack England, British Planes Also Attack Northern Germany</h3>
<p>Havas, London, 2nd - The Ministry of Aviation has just announced that German planes raided western England and Wales last night, dropping many bombs, with minimal losses and few casualties. Five German planes were shot down by us.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 2nd - Officials announced that several British planes flew over northern Germany last night, dropping a few bombs that did not hit military targets. Three British planes have been shot down.</p>
<h3>American Warships Collide and Are Damaged During Exercises</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Manila, 2nd - Authoritative sources here stated that the American destroyers USS Peary and USS Pillsbury collided last night during the final week of exercises in Manila Bay under blackout conditions. The USS Peary, commanded by Admiral Samuel G. Fuqua, suffered minor damage to its bow. The USS Pillsbury, commanded by Admiral Popeye, suffered only superficial damage.</p>
<h3>British Labor Minister Urges The People To Work Hard And Prepare In Order To Assist The Soviet Union And Overthrow Hitler</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - British Labor Minister Bevin, a member of the War Cabinet, spoke last night in Swansea, saying that if the British people spend their money and energy this winter to prepare for Hitler's attack on England next spring, they will have the opportunity to witness Hitler's funeral in the summer. Britain is responsible for equipping and supplying the Soviet Union, so we must have a large number of soldiers for their use. The British government wants the whole country to be prepared. Prime Minister Churchill has absolute trust in all British men and women.</p>
<h3>British Fund for the Relief of China Donates Sewing Machines</h3>
<p>Since Madam Kong, the standing committee member of the Chongqing New Life Movement Women's Guidance Committee's production business group, arrived in Chongqing, the group's work has made great progress. Madam Kong once borrowed credit loans worth over one million yuan on behalf of the group for silkworm and cotton production in Sichuan Province. Recently, the group urgently needed sewing machines to sew winter clothes for wounded soldiers and orphans. Madam Kong entrusted Madam Selwyn-Clarke, honorary secretary of the Overseas Auxiliary Committee of the Chinese Red Cross, to purchase 40 machines and donate them to the group. It is reported that Madam Selwyn-Clarke wrote to Madam Kong, saying that the sewing machines would be donated by the British Fund for the Relief of China in Hong Kong and the Overseas Auxiliary Committee of the Red Cross. She also said that if she could be of slight service in the future, such as supplying tools and goods, she would be happy to comply and would be honored to do so. (1st dispatch)</p>

<h3>Three Principles For Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices, Respectfully Submitted</h3>
<p>High prices have become commonplace in Shanghai in recent years, but the current surge and plunge, like the rapid ascent and dive of an airplane, is unprecedented. The daily rise of gold prices by thousands seems to indicate that the legal tender has become like the German mark/ruble in the last European war; however, the simultaneous daily plunge of yarn prices by thousands clearly shows that it is not a crisis of the legal tender itself. Social consensus has long recognized that hoarding and speculation are the main reasons for today's high prices. Except in lawless areas, such rampant behavior should not be allowed to continue. If Shanghai has entered an era of lawlessness, then the fact that there are police every five steps and soldiers every ten steps, with strict laws and decrees, would also negate the efforts of the authorities. The problem, then, is not a lack of human effort, but a lack of effective methods. How to suppress and stabilize prices? Nothing is better than cracking down on hoarding and speculation! This has long been the consensus. However, how to crack down on hoarding and speculation? The efforts of all parties are still needed.</p>
<p>In its editorial on the first, this newspaper proposed three points: (1) Crack down on existing hoarding and prevent hoarding after the supply is remitted for import. (2) End existing bank loans for goods and crack down on banks continuing to make loans in the future. (3) Crack down on gold trading and eliminate the clues for general commodity speculation. These three points are the basic principles for suppressing and stabilizing prices in this city. Without them, market stability cannot be achieved in the future.</p>
<p>Although the supply of legal tender is limited, the unlimited rise in prices still requires an equivalent amount of currency to match it. How can the limited supply of legal tender adapt to today's unlimited rise in prices? Obviously, the expansion of bank currency is fueling it. Goods stored in warehouses mean that currency is circulating outside; banks making loans for goods are both increasing speculation and hoarding and increasing the supply of currency in the market. Therefore, cracking down on hoarding and prohibiting loans can directly restrain commodity speculation and indirectly contract the currency in the market. Preventing the hoarding and speculation of commodities will naturally balance the supply and demand of goods. The expansion of bank currency will also lose its basis. Stopping bank loans will deprive hoarding and speculation of its backing, and the supply of currency in the market can be greatly reduced. Therefore, both must be advanced simultaneously to be effective.</p>
<p>Hoarding and speculation have only two purposes: one is to take the opportunity to profit, and the other is to disguise capital flight. Both are caused by the sharp rise in gold prices. In theory, commodity prices under the legal tender system should no longer be linked to gold prices; however, the monetary thinking of metal standards is still deeply rooted in people's hearts. When gold prices rise sharply, people generally believe that it is a devaluation of the legal tender and that it is the level of general price increases. In today's world, all countries have banned gold exports; therefore, when the demand exceeds the supply in the gold market of a certain place, there is no possibility of natural adjustment. Therefore, scarcity is valued, and it is bound to increase without decreasing. It is not initially a devaluation of the currency, but the result is to promote the devaluation of the currency. Although the basis of the currency system is not harmed, the level of commodity prices is inevitably greatly affected. In this case, there are only two paths to take: if you do not correct people's minds, you should fundamentally eliminate its transactions. Correcting people's minds is, in fact, impossible; therefore, banning free gold trading is the only countermeasure adopted by countries in the world today. Our country has already adopted this system, but Shanghai alone remains free. Therefore, in order to cut off the adverse effects of gold prices on commodity prices, the authority of the concession authorities must be used as a backing. Otherwise: although the concession authorities can focus on cracking down on hoarding and banks stopping loans, if they still allow speculation in the gold market, it will still cause hoarding and speculation to revive and loan transactions to re-emerge. Because the rise in gold prices is calling for huge profits in hoarding and speculation, and loan transactions cannot be completely eradicated.</p>
<p>This publication once had a suggestion from Mr. Da Ke: (1) The Exchange Equalization Fund should give priority to supplying rice and coal, and should not treat other applicants in the same way. Because the stability of the rice and coal market can reduce the general public's panic about the decline in currency value. (2) The Exchange Equalization Fund should designate several commercial firms to handle the import of essential goods and be responsible for guaranteeing that the foreign exchange they apply for is actually used for the purpose of the application; and use the foreign exchange obtained from the application as the standard for determining the price of imported goods. (3) The British and American governments should declare that all import drafts within Chinese territory are invalid unless they have been stamped and approved by the Exchange Equalization Fund. In addition to the third point, which still requires the assistance of the British and American governments, the first point has already been clearly announced by the Exchange Equalization Fund that the continued supply of foreign exchange for rice and coal is seamless, and the second point is being supported by the concession authorities to organize an import merchants association, which is generally expected to have the same effect. However, this is still limited to adjusting the source, and the adjustment of the circulation process still depends on the realization of the above three principles.</p>
<h3>How to Stop Prices from Rising Sharply</h3>
<p>— Chen Huazhang</p>
<p>Over the past twenty days, prices have risen sharply. Apart from speculators, all citizens are heartbroken. In theory, the Price Stabilization Committee has already notified relevant banks to increase the foreign exchange for importing food and coal in November (see Reuters Hong Kong dispatch on the 30th). Subsequently, Mr. Liddell, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Mr. Minds, the American Chairman, will go to Hong Kong to consult with the Price Stabilization Committee to request more foreign exchange for essential goods. Prices should have fallen. However, they have not. From the first of this month, we have heard that food prices are rising again. If this continues, how will the vast majority of citizens survive? The authorities in the concessions have indeed put a lot of effort into dealing with prices this time; unfortunately, they are still a bit slow. Therefore, we hope that effective measures will be taken quickly and thoroughly implemented. The author also offers some humble opinions here.</p>
<p>Proactive Solutions</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession convened a meeting of representatives from 35 import firms to plan the establishment of an importers' association to promote the effective implementation of the Council's special price management plan. The detailed rules have not yet been announced, so the details are unknown. Presumably, after the establishment of this association, import prices can be suppressed, and at the same time, it can at least assist the authorities in the concessions to manage prices. Therefore, we hope that it can be successfully established, and we also implore the authorities in the concessions to stand in a supervisory position and not be swayed by emotions, so that the association can fulfill the function of a price-stabilizing business. Regarding the establishment of this type of business, the "Shen Bao" economic supplement on September 22 had an article discussing it. The main points are as follows: "The establishment of a price-stabilizing business can refer to the principles of the Price Stabilization Committee, that is, when prices are raised by speculation, it should come out to buy goods to ensure that prices are at a certain level, so that there is no phenomenon of excessive profits or losses for businesses in the city."</p>
<p>A few days ago, the English-language "China Press" published an article suggesting the organization of a consumer association to assist the authorities in managing prices; the association should have broad powers, and if necessary, it can organize consumer cooperative enterprises, selling goods to members with only the lowest profit. This is indeed a well-intentioned method. Originally, the effect of consumer cooperation is to avoid the price increases and exploitation of merchants, and it can also regulate supply and stabilize prices. As for the success of consumer cooperation, the prerequisite is the ability to complete the consumer cooperative organization network. In other words, it must make consumer cooperatives universally distributed before it can have a great effect. Therefore, if this consumer association is established, it must be made universal. Therefore, the success of this matter depends on the leaders of the concession authorities and various public organizations, and taking more planned steps.</p>
<p>The above two methods can be called the most ideal and have active characteristics; but they cannot be achieved in one step. At present, prices have risen to such an extent that distant water cannot put out a fire. Urgent measures are needed.</p>
<p>Emergency Measures</p>
<p>The October price surge did not abate even in the last few days of the month, and it is still rising even higher now at the beginning of November. According to the usual reasons for price fluctuations, it is nothing more than the relationship between supply and demand and currency value. The degree of rise and fall also has a certain limit. But now it is completely different. In the past ten days or so, the black market price of gold has more than doubled, reaching 22,000 to 23,000 yuan per tael (ten taels). The prices of various goods follow gold's lead. When the price of gold rises, the prices of everything else rise with it. Logically speaking, prices and gold are unrelated, but under artificial manipulation, they insist on following it. Therefore, the authorities in the concessions should prohibit the illegal trading of gold on the black market, as has long been suggested by knowledgeable people. It is rumored that the current prohibition of cash transactions is what the Municipal Council has been discouraging. If this is true, it is a wise measure; but there are still over-the-counter cash private transactions. It is hoped that further measures will be taken to deal with this, and that personnel will be sent to monitor the yarn and flower markets. This is also an indispensable method to stop the wild rise in prices.</p>
<p>Secondly, the unprecedented surge in prices this time can be summed up in one word: hoarding. For example, the Price Stabilization Committee has now notified relevant banks to increase the supply of foreign exchange for food and coal. At the same time, the source of rice and coal should gradually drop its price sharply; but the price of rice is still rising, and the price of coal is jumping in the black market. Therefore, only by targeting hoarding can a severe countermeasure be taken. Hoarders can be divided into three types of people: First, the so-called unscrupulous merchants. The hoarding of unscrupulous merchants is mostly wholesalers with strong capital; at present, the hoarding of retail merchants is also very obvious. To put it another way, even if retail merchants do not hoard, it is undeniable that they are speculating. Second, people who are not merchants but see that hoarding can obtain huge profits also follow suit and purchase goods in bulk, waiting for a good price to sell. Their behavior is no different from that of unscrupulous merchants, but their capital is often above that of general retail merchants. Third, consumers with some savings, seeing that prices are soaring, have purchased and stored daily necessities in advance. This kind of behavior, although not hoarding, is still hoarding. In order to thoroughly investigate these three types of people, the authorities in the concessions may wish to select excellent patrol officers to form economic police, distribute them to various places, and investigate at any time; at the same time, citizens should cooperate with them and report any violations. If any of the above three types of people are found, they should be ordered to sell at a reasonable price and be punished according to the severity of their circumstances. Regarding this detailed handling, a police law can be formulated and promulgated.</p>
<p>A Powerful Backing</p>
<p>Again, speaking of the Price Stabilization Fund, its strength is enough to influence the Shanghai market. In the past and present, it has always provided foreign exchange for the import of essential goods. What is regrettable is that it has not been clearly stated. It was not until the end of last month that two telegrams from Hong Kong were seen; but this is not concrete. We hope that it will announce the amount of foreign exchange needed for the import of essential goods on a monthly basis, thereby dispelling the suspicions of speculators and eradicating all kinds of unfounded rumors. As for the position that the Price Stabilization Committee itself should have on prices, it is as Western economic expert An Hanneng said: "The Price Stabilization Committee has excellent reasons to insist on the following two principles: (1) The goods imported through the Price Stabilization Committee's foreign exchange settlement are not allowed to be manipulated or hoarded. These goods must be sold at the usual legitimate merchant's profit and must not be excessive; the price of new goods must be calculated according to the exchange rate stipulated by the Price Stabilization Committee, and the local inventory must be sold at the value of the new goods. (2) The goods imported through the Price Stabilization Committee's foreign exchange settlement are not allowed to be hoarded and must be sold when the market needs them. If demand exceeds supply, importers must use a sharing method to distribute the supply, taking into account the actual consumption of buyers, rather than their storage. (3) The local authorities in Shanghai should cooperate with the Price Stabilization Committee and assist in the implementation of the above two principles. In this way, the Price Stabilization Committee will be happy to provide a steady supply of foreign exchange for the import of essential goods."</p>
<p>Finally, if we want Shanghai's current prosperity to continue so that everyone can enjoy it, then the Chinese and foreign citizens of Shanghai should take responsibility and cooperate closely with the authorities in the concessions. It is incomprehensible that speculators want to drive prices up endlessly, so that the majority of citizens have no way out, causing Shanghai to tend towards a bad situation. If it really gets to this point, what is the use of their hoarding goods? Can they still enjoy it as they do now? We solemnly warn those who speculate and manipulate: they should look further ahead. Their situation is like a mantis seeing a cicada, with a joyful expression; how do they know that there is a bird behind the mantis! In addition, the general public should remain calm in the face of rising prices and should not easily believe rumors or rush to buy goods, creating opportunities for speculators. They should know that the current phenomenon is temporary, and the authorities will never allow prices to rise unreasonably!</p>
<h3>Economic History and the History of Economics</h3>
<p>— Shen Qiyu</p>
<p>China's economy has always been known as backward. In recent years, many ambitious young people have gone to Europe and the United States to study economics in order to further their studies. Mr. Tang Junshu, the son of the contemporary national scholar Mr. Tang Weizhi, has a profound family background and is worthy of being the son of a general. He majored in economics in the United States and is a rare talent among China's economic experts and famous professors. He has served as a professor in various universities in China and has long been respected by the Chinese people. He is studious and thoughtful, and he is humble and amiable. He is particularly interested in the history of Chinese economic thought and has many insights. His recently compiled "Chinese Economic Thought" is the result of ten years of careful research. The first volume details the ancient Chinese economic thought and was published before the war, listed as one of the university books of the Commercial Press, a magnificent work, extremely valuable. This journal once published Mr. Zhu Tongjiu's introduction to the great work of Mr. Liu Dajun (Jitao), a famous Chinese statistical expert. Now, it is planned to introduce Mr. Tang's research conclusions on the history of Chinese economic thought to readers in succession to help domestic researchers of economics understand the changes in Chinese economic thought. ——Author's Note</p>
<p>People often cannot distinguish between the nature of economic history and the history of economics. Economic history is the study of the history of various systems in a certain economic society, including the origin and development of industrial, commercial, agricultural, and financial systems. The history of economics studies the development of economic science, which is different from the former. For example, British economist L. L. Price wrote "A History of Political Economy in England," and Professor W. J. Ashley wrote "Economic History of England." If readers compare the names and contents of the two books in detail, they should be able to understand the difference between economic history and the history of economics.</p>
<p>The importance of economic history research is now universally recognized. However, a hundred years ago, economics was still immature and not valued by scholars. In 1805, German scholars came out to oppose the classical school and created the historical school, advocating the use of historical methods to explain the principles of economics. They worked hard to study the economic history of European countries and advocated that relativism is different from absolutism. This concept is a great convenience for economic researchers and a great progress in economics. According to relativism, which includes three factors: (1) time, (2) place, and (3) environment, it is advocated that the application of economic principles must be subject to three restrictions for review. To know whether an economic theory can be applied to a certain time, place, and environment, it is necessary to study economic history. There are many famous people in this school, such as W. Roscher, G. Schmoller in Germany, and Ashley and W. Cunningham in England, who are particularly famous. Since the prevalence of the historical school's theory, people have begun to pay attention to the importance of economic history, and scholars also attach importance to the research of economic history.</p>
<p>All research must first collect accurate data before engaging in research. The sources of economic history data are nothing more than the following six types: (1) economic history books, (2) economic thought history books, (3) economic journals, (4) economic laws, (5) government economic reports, and (6) biographies of politicians and economists. Economic history also has close relationships with social sciences such as politics, law, society, and ethics, and those who study economic history must study them.</p>
<h3>Does the Price of Gold Affect Legal Tender?</h3>
<p>— Yi Pu</p>
<p>The main factor for the soaring prices in Shanghai is hoarding. However, in addition to this, there are many factors that make prices expensive. One of them is the current gold gambling. This kind of gold gambling is actually a kind of "nonsense." The "chih-hsia" market is purely an artificial transaction. In fact, only 1,000 to 1,500 gold bars are in circulation, which is a very small number. Since the number of spot goods is very limited, speculators can use trading methods to cause huge fluctuations in the "chih-hsia" market price. Since the number of spot goods is limited, raising prices is not difficult. At the same time, they enter other markets to purchase goods, stocks, and bonds; as a result, prices also rise. Ordinary people on the street, seeing the "chih-hsia" soaring, think that the legal tender is falling and go to the market to buy the same goods, stocks, and bonds. These items are originally absorbed by speculators, and at this point, they spit them out, making a big profit.</p>
<p>This kind of cyclical situation is common, and prices are getting higher and higher. The irrationality of this matter can be seen in the following facts. The U.S. government is currently buying gold at a price of US$35 per ounce (official exchange rate), but the price in Shanghai has reached US$57 per ounce, or even more. We should solemnly point out here: this false value is purely caused by the lack of spot gold bars and the insatiable speculators doing their best to exploit the public. If the public rashly believes that this phenomenon is the result of the devaluation of the legal tender and ignores the threat of speculative nonsense, it is very unwise. We can never take the market price of "chih-hsia" in this city as the standard for the price of legal tender. Because the price of legal tender is not falling compared to the true value of gold. The "untrue" value of gold here is purely due to artificial reasons.</p>
<p>The public should pay attention to the manipulators rampant in various markets and should not be fooled by them. Because speculators deliberately stir up trouble, creating a chaotic situation; those who suffer are ultimately the public. The more people pay attention to the price of gold in Shanghai, the deeper they fall into the trap of speculators. Just by reviewing what has happened in the past few weeks, it is not difficult to see that speculators have created the most serious situation, harming the public and thereby enriching themselves. To seek remedy, there is only closure, and the entire society, in order to defend itself against the rampant activities of such people, should also have some potential plans. It is inconceivable that the price of legal tender in Shanghai should be greatly affected by a very small number of "chih-hsia" transactions every day.</p>
<h3>Marketing ABC - Pigments</h3>
<p>— Fan Xuehui</p>
<p>The Darling of the European War</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants in Shanghai Before the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's pigment imports were around 6 million customs gold units; Germany ranked first, accounting for about 70%; followed by the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and Switzerland. The representatives they established in Shanghai:</p>
<p>Name in Their Own Country Representative Trading Company in Shanghai</p>
<p>German Daede Pigment Factory Defu Foreign Firm Manager</p>
<p>American Hengxin Pigment Factory Self-established Branch</p>
<p>American Nanxing Pigment Factory Self-established Branch</p>
<p>British Great Britain Pigment Factory Bunneme Foreign Firm Manager</p>
<p>Swiss Ciba Pigment Factory Self-established Branch</p>
<p>French Siemens Pigment Factory Yongxing Foreign Firm Manager</p>
<p>Japanese Zhaohua Pigment Factory Self-established Branch</p>
<p>Pigments from European countries were sold in China very early. Japan initially only had sulfide metacin. Because the manufacturing process of sulfide metacin is relatively simple. However, in the years 1926-1927, various colored dyes had come to China. It can be seen that the Japanese pigment industry was only beginning to sprout at that time.</p>
<p>Around 1931, Huashang Dazhong Pigment Factory was established, specializing in the manufacture of sulfide metacin. The factory was located in Longhua Town. After the outbreak of the war, Shanghai fell, and the factory was affected by the war and closed down, and it has not produced any products to this day.</p>
<p>Classification by Use Although there are many types of pigments, with more than a thousand brands, they can be divided into two main categories. Although there are many uses, the main ones are dyeing wool, dyeing cotton cloth, and dyeing silk. The following is an analysis according to their nature and use.</p>
<p>(1) Aniline (Artificial Dyes)</p>
<p>A Direct Dyes Direct dyes include scarlet, lake blue, black, rose red, indigo, yellow, golden yellow, brown, purple sauce, dark green, snow blue, and Tibetan blue. Their uses include dyeing cotton fabrics, hemp fabrics. Vegetable fabrics can be used. Before the arrival of non-fading pigments in China, most of China's cloth factories used this pigment. Even today, smaller cloth factories or dyeing factories in the mainland and Shanghai still use it.</p>
<p>B Basic Dyes Basic dyes include rose, magenta, yellow, green, golden yellow, light purple, etc. Their uses are diverse, such as dyeing rayon, paper, wood, bone, cosmetics, food coloring, and raw materials in other industries.</p>
<p>C Acid Dyes Acid dyes include light purple, green, yellow, Tibetan blue, rose red, red, golden yellow, pin blue, meta blue, brown, etc. Their uses include dyeing wool, silk, etc., as well as other animal and insect fabrics.</p>
<p>D Vat Dyes</p>
<p>(1) Indanthrene Made by Daede Pigment Factory</p>
<p>(2) Cledon Made by Great Britain Pigment Factory</p>
<p>(3) Cibanon Made by Ciba Pigment Factory</p>
<p>(4) Ponsol Made by Hengxin Pigment Factory</p>
<p>Vat dyes, also known as reduction dyes, have various uses that are largely the same. They are mostly used by large-scale weaving factories or dyeing factories in China and are suitable for machine dyeing. They come in various colors.</p>
<p>E Printing Pigments</p>
<p>(1) Indigosol (2) Rapidazol</p>
<p>These two printing pigments are produced by Daede and are divided into scarlet, purple sauce, eggplant flower, blue, green, and rose red. They are specially used for printing, such as today's cotton fabrics, bed blankets, bed sheets, and other cotton fabrics are printed with this pigment.</p>
<p>F Naphthol Pigments Naphthol pigments are produced by Daede: divided into scarlet, golden yellow, purple sauce, light purple, blue, rose red, yellow, etc.; in addition to dyeing, they can also be used for printing.</p>
<p>G Sulfurized Pigments Sulfurized pigments include meta blue, military uniform yellow, brown, and Tibetan blue. However, there are no bright colors. They are used exclusively for dyeing cotton cloth.</p>
<p>(2) Indigo</p>
<p>Indigo is a blue color and is a vat dye, with 20%, 50%, 60%, and 80% concentrations. It is sold exclusively to rural towns in China; China has a vast territory and abundant resources, and there are many farmers, so indigo has a very large market.</p>
<p>The selling price of indigo is calculated according to its concentration; the higher the concentration, the more expensive the selling price.</p>
<p>Packaging and Valuation Pigment packaging is divided into many types: such as barrels and cans. There are also large and small sizes. The following is a list of the packaging volume, the corresponding number of heavenly scales and kilograms, and the number of cans in a box during transactions:</p>
<p>The pigment packaging and usage are roughly like this, but there are exceptions, which cannot be fully described.</p>
<p>Market Center There are about forty or fifty pigment companies in Shanghai, and more than a dozen new organizations have been formed during the war. The purchasing center for pigment merchants is mostly Defu Foreign Firm; although Hengxin, Nanxing, Bunneme, etc. also have transactions, they only account for 20-30%. In the wartime Shanghai pigment market, all market price changes followed Defu's prices, so Defu Foreign Firm invisibly became the main body of Shanghai pigment transactions.</p>
<p>Every morning, during Defu's office hours, the street runners and managers in the pigment industry gather there; therefore, market price changes and the thickness of market inventory spread quickly throughout the market.</p>
<p>Local Brands and Package Brands Some pigment imports are barrel-packed, and some are can-packed. After pigment companies import barrel pigments in bulk, they repack them into small cans, label them with trademarks, and they become the so-called "local brands" in the pigment industry.</p>
<p>There is a type called "package brand" in the pigment industry. The method of package brand is that companies agree with the foreign firm on a certain brand of pigment and obtain the exclusive sales right due to the agreed nature; the obligation of package sales is to promote and sell the agreed amount as much as possible. If the sales volume is insufficient in one year, the package seller must pay in advance to ship the goods.</p>

<h3>Implementing Measures to Suppress and Stabilize Prices: Meeting to Be Held in Hong Kong; Kirkland Accompanied Industry Leaders Southbound Yesterday; Delegation's Demands to the Authorities Will Be Responded To; Industry Leaders Carry Proposals Awaiting Careful Discussion by the Stabilization Board</h3>
<p>Kirkland, the representative of the U.S. Treasury Department who came to Shanghai on the 25th of last month to investigate the foreign exchange situation in the Shanghai market, took the Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship back to Hong Kong at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Leader, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Ming Sider, an American member of the board, also went to Hong Kong to request the Stabilization Fund to provide the foreign exchange needed for imports. Thus, they traveled on the same ship with Kirkland. The three, Kirk, Leader, and Ming, were assigned cabins No. 3, 5, and 43 in the main dining area of the ship, living next to each other, showing their close relationship. When the reporter inquired about the price issue to Dr. Ming Sider, he gave the following remarks,</p>
<p>The Three Have High Hopes for This Trip</p>
<p>(Reporter asked) Are you going to Hong Kong to present specific suggestions to the Stabilization Fund Committee? (Ming replied) There are many suggestions to be presented to the Stabilization Fund, but what the results will be and what the effect will be can only be known after careful discussion by the committee. (Asked) Can you foresee the results of the consultation with the Stabilization Fund authorities? (Answer) The hope is great. The decision to go to Hong Kong with the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Leader, to meet with the Stabilization authorities is solely for the purpose of obtaining the Stabilization Fund's sympathy for the Shanghai situation. We will explain to the Stabilization Fund the current difficulties involved. If the Stabilization Fund's sympathy can be obtained, then the future situation will naturally be optimistic. (Question) Will the Shanghai price panic be greatly improved after you and the Stabilization Fund consult? (Answer) This matter depends on public cooperation. We believe that the success of the price management plan depends on the cooperation of the people of the city. If the people are willing to pay a higher price to buy goods whose prices have been raised by speculative merchants, instead of buying goods managed and controlled by the Municipal Council, then there is little hope for improvement in the price situation. Conversely, if the public can give enthusiastic cooperation and refuse to buy goods controlled by unscrupulous merchants, then prices can obviously fall back. (Question) What kind of necessities will this trip request foreign exchange for import? (Answer) All kinds of necessities are included. (Question) How long will you stay in Hong Kong? (Answer) Undecided, roughly from one to two weeks.</p>
<p>Kirkland May Participate in the Meeting</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council's decision to send these two senior officials to Hong Kong to meet with the Stabilization authorities in person is clearly the result of a meeting between General Manager Fei Lipu and Kirkland. As for Kirkland, after arriving in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the Mingsheng ship on the 25th of last month, he stayed in rooms 707 and 708 of the Ducheng Hotel. During his week in Shanghai, in addition to holding talks with responsible persons from Chinese and foreign banks in this port, he also exchanged views with U.S. Consul General Lockehead and U.S. Commercial Counselor Groves, collecting various related information and materials. Then, with the completion of his public affairs, he traveled to Hong Kong yesterday with Leader, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Ming Sider, an American member of the board. He may participate in the Stabilization Meeting to be held in Hong Kong this month.</p>
<p>Stabilizing Prices: Both Sides Working Together</p>
<p>It was learned from banking circles close to Kirkland during his stay in Shanghai that Kirkland had met with responsible persons from the four major Chinese banks and representatives from foreign banks, including Mr. Hawkins of the Mercantile Bank and Mr. McCain of the Citibank. He only met them two days before his departure. It is said that Kirkland's decision to come to Shanghai was in the name of a representative of the U.S. Treasury Department, so his authority was only to solicit some opinions from relevant parties. It is reported that Kirkland's decision to return to Hong Kong will be to write a report based on the results of his investigation in Shanghai for reference by the Stabilization Fund. It is also learned that the Stabilization Fund will hold a plenary meeting in Hong Kong this month, at which Kirkland and his financial expert, Ni Meiya, will be invited to participate. It is further learned that Leader and Ming Sider, specially sent to Hong Kong by the Municipal Council, will meet with Chen Guangfu, Chairman of the Stabilization Committee, Hua Dong Xi Mao Beisong Sun, and British Fei Wei Huoer Basu and Fox. As for the problem of foreign exchange and prices in Shanghai, the Stabilization Committee may have a new decision at the meeting this month because of the departure of Leader and Ming. It is also revealed by banking circles that the method that the Stabilization Fund may take to improve prices in Shanghai is to increase the supply quota for imports of necessities. However, the actual distribution must be managed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Stabilization Fund has the right to stabilize the foreign exchange market, and the Municipal Council has the right to control prices. If the two cooperate, the problems of foreign exchange and prices in Shanghai can be solved at the same time.</p>
<p>The Delegation's Reply Will Be Issued Soon</p>
<p>According to an official of the consular corps, the consular reply to the Municipal Council's request for power to manage prices is expected to be issued on Monday. According to authoritative sources, the consular corps will undoubtedly approve the Municipal Council's request, adding that the consuls of various countries have already received the approval of their respective governments, so the formal reply can be issued on Monday or Tuesday. The general public has great hopes for the issue of Leader and Ming Sider's trip to Hong Kong and the supply of foreign exchange after negotiations with the Stabilization Fund. According to well-informed sources, the two will definitely be able to obtain more foreign exchange to supply to import merchants in this city. The Municipal Council held a special meeting the day before yesterday (31st), which lasted for two hours to discuss price management measures, but no document was issued. It is believed that a meeting will be held with import merchants next week to discuss price management measures.</p>
<h3>Cake and Steamed Bun Association Notice: Enduring Pain to Maintain Original Prices; Maintaining Food for the People and Fulfilling National Duty; Quietly Waiting for the Implementation of Price Management Plan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cake and Steamed Bun Industry Association, because of the illegal increase in flour prices, yesterday issued another notice to its members, saying, "It has been found that in the past two weeks, flour prices have been rising sharply. After our association notified all members on the 23rd of last month that they must not increase prices without authorization, it has won the praise of all sectors. However, in the past two days, a group of hoarding flour merchants, ignoring that flour is a staple food relied upon by the common people, still hope to obtain unexpected huge profits, losing their conscience, and raising flour prices sharply to about 60 yuan per bag. Our cake and steamed bun industry, at a time when the prices of various raw materials have risen sharply, has, according to the requirements of most members, should have the need to revise prices. However, after the association has repeatedly considered the situation, it is actually different from other industries. We believe that if prices are increased, it will make life more difficult for the poor. Therefore, another notice is issued that under the current situation, we can only maintain the original prices to reduce the burden on customers, benefit the public, endure the pain of operating, uphold the principle of maintaining the people's livelihood, and fulfill our national duty. At the same time, we quietly wait for the Municipal Council's preparations for affordable flour to be supplied as soon as possible, and all the measures planned by the authorities will be implemented soon. Then, the suffering we are currently suffering will be easily solved. To sum up the above situation, we hope that all members will do their best to comply."</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Ship Seized; Britain Urges Japan to Pay Attention; Harbor Authorities Still Consider the Yugoslav Ship to Be</h3>
<p>Anchored in the Huangpu River, the Yugoslav ship Tomic was forcibly occupied by the Italian marines stationed in Shanghai last Friday. Most of the crew members and sailors on the ship were forced to go ashore because they were unwilling to submit. After this case occurred, all parties paid close attention to it.</p>
<p>The Ship Captain Has Filed a Protest</p>
<p>Although the Italian side claimed that the ship had been purchased by the Italian shipping company, the fact has proven that this is a complete lie. And the fact that Italian soldiers forcibly occupied the ship is a well-known fact. It is heard that the ship's captain has filed a protest with the responsible authorities. It is learned that the British authorities in this port have also notified the Japanese naval authorities of this matter and urged them to pay attention to this kind of incident that violates Shanghai's neutral status.</p>
<p>There Was Another Shocking Development Yesterday</p>
<p>It is heard that there was another shocking development in this case yesterday. It is learned that because the Italian soldiers arbitrarily consumed almost all the stored alcohol on the ship, they asked the first mate for the key without success. They then invaded the engine room from the skylight, arbitrarily added gasoline, and attempted to start the ship, but failed. It is also reported by a crew member of the ship to the captain on shore that the Italian soldiers on the ship have left, and only a soldier of the No. Kang Tuo Fan Di and a "new captain" are still on the ship. It is learned that the ship has at least 800 tons of coal stored in its cabins. It is heard that the ship was previously leased by the Australian Wheat Company, and the stored coal belongs to the company. The ship is now in a state where it can sail at any time. According to the first mate, the Italian soldiers once asked him for the key to the engine room, but he refused. The Italian soldiers then climbed in through the skylight. The ship is now berthed in a neutral port. The customs and the authorities managing harbor affairs are the responsible authorities. Since they do not recognize the sale of the ship, the port officials still consider it to be a Yugoslav ship.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Police Department Annual Inspection; A Large Number of Police Officers Receive Medals</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department is scheduled to hold its annual inspection ceremony on the 5th of this month. A large number of police officers will receive medals at that time. Their names are as follows:</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Shi Sijian will be awarded a first-class medal. Sergeants Chen Youfang, Chinese Constables Zhao Fengjun, and Liu Baoshan will each be awarded a first-class medal. The late Chinese Constables Zhang Aifa and Yang Haibo will each be posthumously awarded a first-class medal. Chinese Constables Ji Xiuhong, Zhang Lin, Wang Yuheng, Huang Runshen, Du Chunqin, Zhong Ming, Wei Julin, Liu Shengshan, Yin Xinfeng, Shi Zhaowen, Xiang Wenlin, Wang Peilin, He Heyan, Ma Siming, Zhu Shuichun, Chen Jiahong, Chen Qingbo, Su Wentai, Xuan, Wang Fengren, Du Laibin, Xu Minghong, Zhao Jinsheng, Zhang Zhenfa, Jin Zhimu, Zhu Enhui, Liu Wanxuan, Sun Yuhai, Wang Haibo, Yin Yanting, Miao Yanxing, Chinese Detectives Hao Yuxian, Guo Jingbang, Hao Shangqin, Qin Boliang, Wang Zhenfei, Detectives Xu Guirong, Ji Xiucheng, Zhang Keqin, Guo Ruiquan, etc., will each be awarded a first-class medal. In addition, a large number of foreign police officers will also receive awards at the same time.</p>
<h3>200,000 Bags of Foreign Rice on the Way to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to rice industry sources yesterday, (1) A large amount of foreign rice is on the way to Shanghai, amounting to about 200,000 bags. Most of this foreign rice is Rangoon special small rice. Other rice is relatively scarce. This kind of foreign rice was commissioned by various rice merchants in the city to foreign firms a month ago, and the production price per bag is still less than 130 yuan in national currency. The cost is obviously very low. If it is transported to Shanghai and sold at the current time, a very generous additional profit can be obtained. (2) Recently, due to the repeated rise in the price of domestic and foreign rice, rice merchants are very active in handling rice, trying to transport it to the port in a short period of time and sell it on the market at the current market price. Therefore, in recent days, various foreign firms have received twice as many orders from rice merchants to purchase foreign rice as in the past. They have now telegraphed overseas one after another to negotiate purchases.</p>
<h3>12,000 Bales of Cotton to Arrive Within the Week</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, the Panamanian merchant ship Fuqinia will arrive in Shanghai from Saidou Port this week. The ship carries a total of 5,000 bales of cotton and will berth at the Pudong Gonghexiang Wharf to unload. Another Panamanian merchant ship Huahua will arrive in Shanghai within the week. The ship carries 7,000 bales of cotton.</p>
<h3>London Czech Government Appoints Minister to China; Minovsky Will Take Office; Old Friends in Shanghai Express Joy</h3>
<p>The Chinese government has agreed to the appointment of Stanislav Minovsky by the London Czech government as the new Minister to China, who will arrive in China soon to take office. Mr. Minovsky is 54 years old and was born on February 17, 1887. During the last Great War, he served in Russian Siberia and France, serving as a Czech military officer. After the war, he joined the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs and served as Secretary to Foreign Minister Benes. After the German army occupied Czechoslovakia, Mr. Minovsky took office as Consul General in Libailaina. In March 1939, the Czech embassy in Jugoslavia was closed, and he went to London. After the Czech government was established in 1941, he continued to serve as a member of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The new Minister to China has many old friends in Shanghai. Now that it is heard that Mr. Minovsky has been appointed by the Czech government as an important diplomatic envoy to China, they are all very pleased.</p>
<h3>Pan American Company to Set Up Airport in Borneo; Hong Kong-Philippines Aviation Industry Officially Launched by United Airlines on October</h3>

<h3>National Father's Birthday Anniversary Approaching; Preparing for Enthusiastic Celebration; Commemorating the Great Achievements of Creating the Republic of China; Continuing to Promote Various Donation Campaigns</h3>
<p>November 12th is the anniversary of the birth of the National Father Sun Yat-sen. Various circles in the city, because of the extraordinary times, do not intend to overdo the celebration ceremony. However, in order to commemorate the great revolutionary spirit of the Premier and the great achievements of creating the Republic of China, it was decided to follow the central government's regulations and the flag-hanging methods agreed upon by the concession authorities, and all will fly the Qing Tian Bai Ri Man Di Hong national flag for one day on that day to celebrate.</p>
<p>Citywide Holiday; Promoting Responsibilities</p>
<p>All agencies in the city</p>
<p>All agencies in the city, such as the two high courts, the Jianghai Customs, the post office, and various groups, schools, factories, businesses, and various industries and markets, in addition to flying flags to celebrate, will also have a holiday for the day. The post office will collect and deliver mail in accordance with the holiday methods on Sundays. Postal money orders and packages will be stopped. Other institutions such as banks and money shops will postpone the collection and settlement of silver and money until the next day. Various schools will also hold individual meetings to elaborate on the deeds and commemorative significance of the National Father. People from all walks of life have decided to continue to promote campaigns such as winter clothing money and donations for disaster relief to show their patriotism.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Preparing for Alert</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions, considering that the 12th is the National Father's birthday, are sincerely afraid that bad elements will take advantage of this opportunity to engage in illegal activities and endanger the security of the concessions. Therefore, they decided to prohibit all illegal gatherings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities from the 7th. From the 10th, they began to jointly prepare for alert, and sent additional detectives to conduct district searches and strictly enforce curfew laws. As for road bridges and traffic, it is not intended to impose a blockade.</p>
<h3>Impact of Factories' Ban on Transportation; Coal Consumption Gradually Decreasing; Dozens of Coal Transportation Vessels Every Month; Actual Sales in the Market Steadily Declining</h3>
<p>Half a month ago, due to slight changes in the international situation, general speculators attempted to move again, worshiping the market by hoarding and speculating on goods. The price of smoke and white coal rose sharply in unison. Now that the international situation has gradually become clear, speculation has obviously no excuse. At the same time, various factories have also reduced production due to the impact of the ban on transportation, and the demand for coal has gradually decreased. There is a lack of interest in the spot goods in the market. Today, the coal market is showing a phenomenon of a slump. According to news from various coal industry groups, the price of smoke and white coal will soon begin to fall back.</p>
<p>Coal Vessel Statistics</p>
<p>The city's coal reserves are unusually sufficient. In addition, coal consumption has not increased during the electricity saving period. The source of supply is very smooth, and there is no fear of interruption. According to reliable sources in the shipping industry yesterday, the amount of coal transported to Shanghai last month was particularly strong. On the 3rd, the Malilyse Moller carried 1,000 tons. On the 6th, the Josephine Moller carried 1,370 tons. On the 14th, the Laos carried 1,800 tons. On the 15th, the Arianne Moller carried 650 tons. On the 17th, the Pei An carried 4,500 tons. On the 11th, the Beina Ting carried 3,000 tons. On the 13th, the Ramona carried 5,000 tons. On the 15th, the Fu Husing carried 100 tons. On the same day, the Copella carried 3,000 tons and the Tikugr Moller carried 750 tons. On the 24th, the Ariadn Moller carried 800 tons, and other ships such as the Tianlong Chuan Maru also carried no less than 4,000 tons of coal. The total is more than 25,970 tons, and other scattered amounts are not included.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Goods Shipped to the Mainland Must Affix Stamps</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance ordered the direct tax bureaus of various provinces and the stamp tax supervisors of various provinces to order the inspection and sampling personnel to ensure that if invoices for goods shipped from Shanghai to various provinces in the mainland do not have stamps affixed, they should be ordered to be punished according to law in order to emphasize national taxes.</p>
<h3>Closing of Customs Office on the 12th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Commissioner announced yesterday that the customs office will be closed on the 12th of this month (Wednesday) due to a customs holiday.</p>
<p>This is the Leather Shoe Industry Association (office in Moore Hall)</p>

<h3>Goods Exported from Hong Kong Must Be Opened for Inspection; Executed by the Supervisor of Customs Anti-Smuggling Office</h3>
<p>According to sources in the business community in this city yesterday, goods exported from Hong Kong, in addition to obtaining certificates, are also required to be opened for inspection, which is a very complicated procedure. The inspection methods are as follows: (1) For goods packed for export, the measurement office and the Customs Supervision Office must be notified 24 hours in advance to carry out inspection before export is allowed. (2) The loading paper must be submitted to the Customs Supervision Anti-Smuggling Office for inspection before the goods are unloaded, and stamps must be affixed. It can be released only after obtaining the following approval: (A) Exempt from inspection; (B) Released after inspection. (3) The loading paper must be submitted to the import and export office together with a statement of consent. The statement of consent must be signed by the responsible person of the exporter, proving what kind and what type of goods they are, and then approved by the tax inspector. (4) The back of the loading paper must be officially approved by the authorities and have words such as "Exempt from Inspection" or "Released after Inspection" before unloading is allowed. The procedure for inspecting goods: the inspection of export goods is carried out at the same time as the measurement official. When the measurement official is measuring the goods at the designated location, the import and export office will send a specialist to arrive and select the goods that are considered necessary to be inspected. The boxes and bags will be opened, and the owner or transporter of the goods must cooperate to assist in the work. The inspectors must pack the goods in person and affix the seal by the tax collector. All supporting documents of the exporter must be submitted to the anti-smuggling office for inspection before approval is given for release.</p>
<h3>Elaborating on the Theory of Education for All in the 23rd Lecture of the Five Societies</h3>
<p>(Continued) It was also pointed out that Guan Gong was a devout believer. The Chaldean history states, "The Gospel was first spread in China by the power of St. Thomas." According to the history of missionaries in China, "Achaeus of the Majun Sect in the 5th century, Nestorian Silas in the 6th century, and Salila-Zacha in the 8th century had already established Chinese dioceses." "In the 7th century, the revised Syriac breviary mentioned China, and the Chinese people could speak Syriac, so it must be one of the twelve apostles. At the beginning of the 10th century, Nestorian Patriarch Ebedjesus, in accordance with the will of Yahballaha III, who grew up in China, associated with the Thomas sect." Therefore, the book "Chinese Christians in the 16th Century" refutes the above theories as late fabrications. In the 17th century, during the fifth year of the reign of Emperor Xizong of the Ming Dynasty (Tianqi), a stele of the popular Nestorianism written by Yijingjing during the second year of the reign of Emperor Dezong of the Tang Dynasty (Jianzhong) was unearthed in Xi'an. It was also written in Syriac and referred to "Emperor Taizong's decree to welcome the virtuous Alopen from Great Qin in the twelfth year of his reign," as seen by the Italian priest Giuleo Aleni. In the appendix of Western Studies, Li Zhizao used the Nestorian stele to prove the doctrines of Christianity. Wang Pu's "Tang Huiyao" said, "The Persian monk Alopen." The Zhenyuan Buddhist Records stated, "The Persian monk Jingjing from the Great Qin Temple should preach the Mishihe (Messiah) religion." The Tang Dynasty Book Wuzong Ji mentioned "Da Qin Mu Hu Ao." The History of Religious Thought pointed out that these were all Christians. Yao Kuan's "Xixi Conghua" and Qian Qianyi's "Jingjiao Kao" considered the Persian Da Qin Manichaean religion as one source. Hang Shijun's "Jingjiao Xu Kao" quoted ancient Arabian history to prove that it was Islam. Qian Daxin's "Jinshiwen Ba" and Wang Chang's "Jinshi Cuibian" also mentioned it. Someone said, "The inscription says 'Shizi Yongzhuang' and 'Lv Xiuyan wrote it', implying Xuanzang and Lv Yan, suspecting that it must be a Ming Dynasty forgery."</p>
<p>During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, the World-Honored One's Discourse on Charity and Praise of the Three Majesties, and other texts were discovered in the Dunhuang Stone Chamber. Japan's Haneda Toru collected the Listening Mystery Poem Sutra, and Li Shengduo obtained the Zhiyuan Anle Sutra. The Xuanyuan Zhiben Sutra states that missionary history says Alopen was a Nestorian disciple. During the European Crusades in the 13th century, the Roman Pope obtained the support of the Yuan Dynasty. When Emperor Shizu ascended the throne, Christianity was spread to China along with it. Marco Polo's Travels mentioned that Zhaizhao sent envoys to the Pope to recruit highly knowledgeable priests and obtain lamp oil from Jesus' tomb, etc. Qing Hongjun's "Translation and Supplement to the Yuan History" proves that "Yelike Weng was a Catholic," which is also mentioned in Dosang Xuliegu's biography, "The Mongols called Catholicism Aleke Weng," which was under the jurisdiction of the Chongfu Si, along with the Buddhist Xuanzheng Yuan, and the Daoist Ji Shen Yuan. Liang Xiangji mentioned, "The commander-in-chief of Zhenjiang built seven temples." Yu Yue's preface to Yang Wenjie's "Dongcheng Ji Yu" states, "The Dapuxing Temple enshrines the Yelike Weng religion," which is the same as the Nestorianism stele's saying of "judging the four directions with the cross." The missionary records and canons of the 16th century state, "The Buddhist temples in Jiangnan were transformed from the Fanghui Seminary." The magazine states, "Tibetan Lamaism and Nestorianism have the same origin," as evidence of the submergence of ancient Christianity in China. During the reign of Emperor Chengzong of the Yuan Dynasty, the Holy See sent the Italian Franciscan Giovanni Montecorvion to Shangdu. At the beginning of the 14th century, he was appointed Archbishop and founded the Chinese missionary district. In a letter to Europe, he said, "The apostles or their descendants came to China from He."</p>
<p>According to missionary records, the first person to be approved for missionary work was the Portuguese Jesuit Melichior Nuncz Barrato in the 16th century. Saint Francis Xavier died on Shangchuan Island before he could come to China. Three years later, he finally arrived in Macau. His diary also states, "China has never heard of the Gospel or the descent of God into the world." Later, Martino de Her Rada of the Augustinian order stayed in Fujian for more than a month, collecting hundreds of books to study the internal affairs of China and created Chinese linguistics. Don Phlippe of the Bandxiong Association sent a letter to the Chinese Emperor, offering precious tributes, as seen in the missionary records. Alexandre Valiguani, an Italian Jesuit priest, knew that missionary work in China was not easy and must have a planned approach to adapt to China, reformed the old methods of missionary work, selected capable people, first studied Chinese etiquette, language, and writing, and used them for preaching. Michele Ruggieri was kind and good at socializing. Western scholars were completely sinicized. He first built the Church of the Holy Mother, provided a statue of the Holy Mother, and used Chinese to describe the precious records of God. It was printed and published in the twelfth year of Wanli. Chen Rui, the governor of Guangdong, inspected Macau. Bishop Don Leonardo de Sao of Rodesa Chen said that foreign residents sought refuge and were originally obedient subjects of the Chinese court. He also wrote in a letter, "Risking the heavy seas, admiring the Celestial Dynasty, willing to be listed as subjects, and changing to monastic garb." Four monks detailed their diaries. His assistant Matteo Ricci followed Fan's instructions, wore Confucian robes, and used Chinese classics to prove religious doctrines. He used lectures to associate with scholars and officials. Those who were baptized included Xu Guangqi, whose baptismal name was Dalv, Qu Ruji, whose baptismal name was Najue, and Li Zhizao, whose baptismal name was Liang, laying the foundation for missionary work in China. He died and was buried by Emperor Shenzong. At the beginning of the 17th century, Western Jesuit scholars all followed the correct calendar. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the German Joannes Adam Schall Von Bell was given the title of Tongwei Teacher. During the Kangxi period, this person, Ferdinandus Raux, and the Portuguese Joesph Riberio and Verissimo Monterio de Serra, were all astronomical officials from the West. It was not until the seventeenth year of Daoguang and the twenty-fourth year of Kangzhao that Luo Wenzao of the Dominican Order became the first Chinese bishop. In the eleventh year of the Republic of China, Archbishop Mgr. Ceiso Costantinl Archbishop of Theodosia came to China. He examined the four fourth year thirty-first year, three times Ephesus meetings, re-emphasizing Jesus' divinity as orthodox, and considering the Nestorianism of the human nature as heresy, which later became the Persian sect. In 1054, those who separated from the Roman Church in the West became the Greek sect. In 1517, the German Luther reformed the old Catholic Church and created the new religion, which became the Lutheran Church. In the twelfth year of Jiaqing, the Englishman Morrison came to China to preach the new religion. According to the Chinese translation of the Bible by the London Society, by the twenty-fourth year, the Chinese-English dictionary was compiled by the China Christian Church, the Sheng Gong Hui, the Congregational Church, and the Baptist Church. To this day, the various denominations of Protestantism, such as the China Christian Church, the Sheng Gong Hui, the Congregational Church, the Baptist Church, the Lutheran Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Inland Mission, and the Methodist Episcopal Church, are all over China.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Prostitutes (4)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Kequn</p>
<p>The high-class foreign brothels in Shanghai are all registered with the Public Works Bureau as "boarders." There are only five or six such demon dens in Shanghai. The average price of women in these places is around 50 yuan. If a customer wants to drink in such a brothel, he must also buy wine to give to all the other women in the brothel. In this way, one drink usually costs 50 yuan. In reality, these women don't really drink, but only drink some ginger ale.</p>
<p>According to a foreign teacher who told the reporter: The women here all have a good understanding of hygiene. If they have a disease, they usually take a break from work until they are cured by a doctor. Although in a few cases, they are forced to continue working by the brothel owner even if they are already ill, but even if they are ill, because they have a good knowledge of hygiene, the chance of being infected with the disease by having a relationship with them is rare.</p>
<p>The brothel owners treat the women in these brothels very well. Many old foreign women can use this to become a little rich and accumulate a small amount of wealth immediately. These prostitutes only receive a few customers per night. Some of them are already addicted to drugs. The nationalities of these prostitutes are mostly Russian. There are also British, American, and Scandinavian women mixed in. There are also a few prostitutes who are German Jews.</p>
<p>The process by which these prostitutes fall into this business is generally that they initially stay in Shanghai for various other reasons and work as waitresses in bars. The working hours in the bars are very long, and their work is erotic. Therefore, when a representative from a high-class brothel lures them with benefits and tells them, "If you want to go there, you can get more money, and the method is very easy." Under these circumstances, after listening to the sweet words, how can they not yearn for it, and finally fall into their trap. After they fall into the brothel, they feel that life is easier, so they settle down and start this new life. When they feel tired at night, someone will offer them strong opium to relieve their fatigue. After this stimulant, their spirits are revived and they return to happiness. Later, if they feel tired again, they still have strong opium to relieve them. After a few weeks, they become addicted. This is the general life situation of prostitutes in the foreign gold-digging dens in Shanghai. However, there are also many people who live a slightly more serious life, so there are still a few women whose living conditions are better, not as decadent as described above. They save a small amount of money to prepare to leave Shanghai or to start other normal businesses.</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen brothels in Shanghai where the cost is slightly cheaper than the high-class brothels described above. These brothels all have very eye-catching and appropriate names marked at their entrances. The women in these brothels are all Russian and Korean. Their prices range from 30 to 50 yuan.</p>
<p>There is also a type of noble prostitute in Shanghai who seems to be a woman from a good family and privately engages in this business. Their purpose is nothing more than to earn money for personal enjoyment. Those who visit this type of brothel must have a guide who knows the way to introduce them before they can enter. Upon entering, a solemn middle-aged woman comes out to greet them, serving tea to the guests. After she asks about the visitor's identity, status, and economic situation, if she is satisfied, she will immediately ask the guest what type of woman they like, tall or small? Fat or thin? Let the guest decide. After the guest chooses the type of woman they want, she will contact them and summon them. As a rule, the women do not immediately enter the guest room after being summoned. They first look into the room through a small window on the door to see if they know the customer in the room. If the person is someone they know, they will not enter the room. The women here usually only allow one meeting, and the price for one night ranges from 200 to 1,000 yuan. In addition, customers often have expensive clothes made for them.</p>
<p>According to a Chinese venereologist, many wealthy Chinese men have contracted serious diseases from these women. Similarly, many women have also been infected with serious diseases through the solicitation of these places, under the principle of having fun and earning pocket money in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of "Western private prostitutes" in Shanghai who engage in prostitution. They often publish advertisements in the newspapers for "manicure girls" or "massage girls." Although the police authorities have repeatedly tried to ban their activities and have asked the local English newspapers to investigate the authenticity of such advertisements before they are published, otherwise they will not be published, they are still very active in the market. They are mostly Russian women. Their friends encourage each other and say that they can go to visit at a certain time and achieve certain goals. Their fees range from 10 to 100 yuan. These prostitutes certainly cannot stay clean for a long time, because one customer often visits them for a day and night before leaving, and another customer comes right after. As a result, they spread venereal diseases among the male Caucasians in Shanghai, making the doctors in Shanghai forever busy diagnosing and treating diseases.

<h3>Extortion by Intimidation, Convicted and Punished, Hand-Pulled Grenade and Letters Confiscated</h3>
<p>Yu Youqing, a wealthy gentry from Songjiang, residing at No. 5, Lane 688, Tonghe Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, received five consecutive threatening letters from September 14th to the 17th of last month, along with a grenade, extorting 5,000 yuan in legal tender from him, otherwise the lives of his entire family would be in their hands. After receiving the grenade, he was terrified and reported it to the Xinza Gate Patrol Station in charge, which sent detectives disguised as tea attendants and requested assistance from the French patrol station to follow the designated location to Room 215 of the Gongping Hotel at No. 291 Edward Road and No. 150 Caishi Street to arrest the extortionists Gu Caifa and Yin Guilin, and seized the 5,000 yuan in stolen money that the defendants had already accepted, and sent them to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court for prosecution according to law. The defendants confessed that the initiator of the crime was Wang Bingyi, who was at large, because Wang's mother worked as a maid in the victim's home and was very clear about the victim's economic situation, and that the two of them were in a passive position. The court ordered them to be returned to custody. The sentence was pronounced the day before yesterday by Judge Shi presiding over the Second Criminal Court, Gu Caifa was sentenced to one year for attempted extortion by intimidation, Yin Guilin was sentenced to five months imprisonment, and five threatening letters and a hand-pulled grenade were confiscated.</p>

Qu Jinlin of Paramount desperately blocked the ball, tripping Li Zude of Blue and White, and was ruled a foul. Time ran out, Zude took the penalty, but unfortunately, the ball luck was not good, and the one ball of life and death failed to hit, and Paramount won the championship with 25 to 24 over Blue and White.</p>

<h3>Daylight Saving Time Canceled</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Starting from midnight on November 1st, daylight saving time is canceled. This morning, many families are hoping to sleep an extra hour because husbands or working women can leave for the office an hour later.</p>
<p>In fact, getting up early is very important in the family. If you can get up early every day, many household chores can be done more smoothly, allowing the housewife to be calm and organized.</p>
<p>Some housewives (we hope this number is not large) do not pay attention to time at all. They sleep very late and get up very late. Buying groceries and cooking are all done by the maid. These people's families will definitely not be healthy.</p>
<p>Many husbands also do not keep time. They cannot come home for dinner on time, causing the children to fall asleep while waiting. Many family quarrels are caused by husbands not keeping time.</p>
<p>I believe that if we can fully utilize all the time we have in our lives, and every minute we spend doing something meaningful, and every minute that passes brings us joy, then life will be more meaningful and more beautiful.</p>
<p>My Family Problems</p>
<h3>I Fear Marriage</h3>
<p>— Zhenzi</p>
<p>Because of physiological needs and years of wandering, I need marriage to comfort me.</p>
<p>Marriage is sweet, but every time I think about marriage and the situation after marriage, a gloomy atmosphere drives away the sweetness; thus, it has become my fear of marriage.</p>
<p>Am I not satisfied with my partner? No, although she is not an outstanding woman, she is very suitable for me. She is two years younger than me and has a junior high school education. She is not a member of the progressive professional women's circle; on the contrary, she is a skilled cook in the kitchen! Although she cannot be economically independent, I cannot say that she is my appendage. Even if she goes to work in society, the gains and losses may not be commensurate, so I don't resent her being backward.</p>
<p>Marriage expenses, living expenses, children's education expenses... a series of them hit my heart. In this unreasonable and abnormally developing society, economic problems have almost become the greatest hardship for every salaried class and an important factor in the general fear of marriage. Why should I elaborate further? Some people say, isn't a poor and humble couple more meaningful than a marriage under consumerism! This may be an ideal that can become a reality, I pray for it.</p>
<p>However, in any case, it cannot eliminate my fear of marriage. The reason is that my career is simply not suitable for marriage. It will shatter a happy marriage into pieces, not to mention that our marriage does not have a significant advantage in other conditions, how can it withstand this ruthless palm blow?</p>
<p>I am a factory worker in a yarn factory. The machinery in the yarn factory runs day and night. People are not machines after all and must work in two shifts. The day shift is from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., and the night shift is from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next morning. Adding in meals, walking, bowel movements, and other private matters, it takes a full 15 hours. There is not enough time left for sleep. Even if there is infinite happiness in the family, how can I enjoy it? Moreover, the day and night shifts rotate every week. When working the day shift, I have to go to the factory at four or five o'clock in the morning, "letting down the fragrant quilt," as the predecessors have done. I dare not say more. But when I am constantly working the night shift, "resting at sunrise," am I supposed to ask my wife to live this upside-down life with me?</p>
<p>Love is like the seed of a plant. It can grow in a suitable environment and can also be destroyed by storms.</p>
<p>I fear the arrival of this unfortunate fact. I fear marriage! (Payment of ten yuan for family monthly publications)</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Regarding Mr. Zhen's reasons for fearing marriage, I think the economic problem is more important. Because changing shifts and "working at sunrise" and "resting at sunset" is not a very serious problem. Are all the families of newspaper reporters unhappy? Marriage is an art, it all depends on how the parties involved handle it. The reversal of time will not affect the feelings of the couple.</p>
<p>I believe that a person with a job should engage in self-cultivation and enrich themselves, because economic problems can only be solved reasonably through hard work. Please don't say you don't have time. Even if you spend 15 minutes a day reading a book, you can have considerable results after a year.</p>
<p>If Mr. Zhenzi is under thirty years old, then it is okay to wait for some time.</p>

<p>— Li</p>
<p>In this weather that is constantly changing, it is easiest to catch a cold, so the prevention and treatment of colds are really urgent. If you have already been attacked by a cold, then the first thing to do is to keep your throat and chest warm. A light and soft scarf is a good idea. Rinse your mouth with cold water once or twice a day, adding half a teaspoon of salt to a glass of cold water, because cold water can increase the resistance of the mucous membrane, and salt has antibacterial and disinfectant effects.</p>
<p>Sunlight is also an element that helps increase resistance, so you should breathe a lot of fresh air and enjoy a lot of sunlight every day. On average, we drink too little water every day. Drinking eight glasses of boiled water a day is very appropriate and can help the body eliminate toxins.</p>
<p>According to medical research, worries and overwork are one of the causes of colds, so to prevent colds, you must not overwork every day and need to have eight hours of adequate sleep. But if there is a fever or sore throat, then you should see a doctor.</p>
<h3>One Experience in Housework</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>When polishing leather shoes, adding one or two drops of vinegar or acetic acid to the shoe polish can make the shoes shine more brightly and last longer. Lemon juice contains bone-dissolving oxygen, so when eating fish, if a fish bone gets stuck in your throat, swallowing lemon juice will dissolve it. If you don't have lemons, you can buy citric acid from the drugstore and dissolve it.</p>
<p>If you bury eggs in a wooden box containing salt, with several holes at the bottom of the box covered with thick paper, they can be preserved for a long time. If you rub lemon juice on your face before applying face powder, it can make your skin more tender, cleaner, and softer. If you use milk instead, it has the same effect. If you mix a small spoonful of glycerin into ten times the amount of water and pour it into the bathtub when bathing, you will feel exceptionally comfortable when bathing and can relieve fatigue and hardship.</p>
<p>If the skin is burned or the hands, feet, or face are cracked, you can apply glycerin to the cracked areas to heal quickly.</p>
<p>Pomelo pits should not be discarded. If you soak them in boiling water, they can replace hair cream, and they are rich in viscosity and have a smooth and moisturizing texture. Frequent use on hair can make the hair black and shiny.</p>
<h3>One Week of Everyday Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>For the past month, the so-called crab of the "intestine-less gentleman" has been the most talked-about thing in Shanghai. Almost every important street has one or two crab stalls. Even though each crab the size of a bowl costs as much as four or five yuan, wealthy gentlemen and ladies come to buy them. However, we salaried people do not have the luck to eat them. Personally, I don't have much fondness for the so-called big hairy crab. Instead of peeling the crab meat and dipping it in vinegar and ginger, stir-fried crab roe is more flavorful and also more economical. For example, eating a big hairy crab costs at least two or three yuan per crab. Small ones are not worth eating. But eating stir-fried crab roe, two small crabs for one yuan can also be peeled. If you spend one yuan to buy two small crabs, peel them to get a shallow bowl of crab roe, and then add some egg flowers and chives, you can divide it into two bowls for the needs of two meals, day and night. Therefore, from an economic standpoint, I advocate eating stir-fried crab roe and do not advocate eating big steamed crabs.</p>
<p>Monday: Celery stir-fried with shredded pork, sweet and sour pan-fried ribbonfish, spinach and sweet potato soup, braised radish slices</p>
<p>Tuesday: Onion stir-fried with shredded beef, stir-fried small shrimp, green vegetables stir-fried with glass noodles, vegetarian tofu soup</p>
<p>Wednesday: Preserved mustard greens stir-fried with diced pork belly, meatloaf stewed with turtles, raw golden flower vegetables, green onion fermented soybean paste</p>
<p>Thursday: Tomato beef soup, fish head with bean curd sheets, spinach braised with tofu, celery mixed with sesame sauce</p>
<p>Friday: Green flower braised meat balls, vinegar-glazed yellow croaker fillets, preserved mustard greens with soybean sprouts, vegetarian dishes with fried fermented soybeans</p>
<p>Saturday: Silver sprouts stir-fried with shredded chicken, tomato braised crucian carp, braised cabbage, jellyfish and radish shreds</p>
<p>Sunday: Curry meat, stir-fried crab roe, vegetarian ten-treasure dish, mixed artemisia</p>

<h3>(143) Crab Meat Lion Head Meatballs</h3>
<p>— Draft by Sun Mingjing</p>
<p>Ingredients: Crab, fresh meat, cooking wine, soy sauce, salt, sugar, green onion, lard, cooking oil, ginger, MSG, green vegetables, refined white water chestnut flour. Preparation: First, cook the crab thoroughly, remove the shell, take the meat, chop it together with the fresh meat, add a little water chestnut flour, mix with an appropriate amount of chopped green onion, minced ginger, MSG, cooking wine, fine salt, white sugar, etc., make it into a ball shape, put it into a pot of boiling lard and fry it repeatedly until it turns golden brown, then take it out. Then, stir-fry the washed green vegetables with cooking oil, then put the fried crab meat balls on top of the vegetables and braise them until the vegetables are tender and cooked. Answering Ms. Lu Liqing's question about "Long-term crab storage method":</p>
<p>"Round navel in September, pointed in October," the current time is the best season for eating crabs. But if you store the crabs until the cold winter and cook them, then "holding them while appreciating the snow" also feels like a different kind of enjoyment. The method is to select plump crabs in September and October, store them in jars, use mud to build some embankments inside the jars, and then spread loose mud on the bottom, filling it with water to about half, so that the crabs are in the middle, as if living in a cave. Wait until three days before eating, remove all the water in the container, grind black sesame seeds into a fine powder, mix them into the mud, and separate them from the crab layer. Cover the mouth of the jar with a board so that the crabs cannot move. Take them out and steam them three days later, the flavor and robustness are comparable, but feeding them should not be done too early, otherwise, there is a risk of death.</p>
<p>Everyone: If you want to buy "MSG", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Extract", and oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, please dial 144594, a special messenger will deliver it immediately, without charging delivery fees.</p>

<h3>Willing to Go Backwards</h3>
<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>What an unambitious statement – willing to go backwards! As the saying goes: When people are poor, their spirits are low, and low means shrinking. Generally speaking, when individuals have no other options, their ambitions may "shrink."</p>
<p>Shanghai people also have a local saying called: "Living alive and shrinking back," meaning that although a person's age increases, all thoughts and actions are only moving backward, out of date, and without any progress.</p>
<p>Who wants to "go backwards"? Who wants to "retreat"? But in this era of skyrocketing prices and extremely difficult living conditions, we look back to the past and reminisce about the past, feeling that we want to "go backwards" but cannot!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday at midnight, everyone turned back the clock by one hour, and summer time bid farewell from then on. If we could extend this further, with everyone going backwards from this one hour, one day, one week, one month, and honestly "living alive and shrinking back," wouldn't that be wonderful?</p>
<p>Saturday (1st): Kunshan new indica rice was 198 yuan per picul; going backwards one day, Friday, it was 191 yuan per picul; going backwards one week (October 26th), it was 179 yuan per picul; going backwards one month (October 10th), it was only 150 yuan per picul.</p>
<p>I ask, in terms of living, who among the citizens of Shanghai is unwilling to go backwards!</p>
<p>We are speaking out for the salaried class, hoping that those self-proclaimed "progressive people," quick-witted, hoarding, and speculating gentlemen, will consider the many "backward" small citizens of Shanghai and temporarily become "outdated people"!</p>

<h3>Rescuing the People from Fire and Water at the Cost of Sacrifice: The Work of Firefighters</h3>
<p>— Gengyun</p>
<p>"Neither like a copyist, nor like a firefighter," the status of a "fire ghost" in the minds of most people can be imagined in these two idioms! The fire department is also known as the fire brigade. People who work here should be called firefighters or firemen. However, people just don't call them that, but instead bestow the epithet "ghost." "Ghost" means a spirit, something isolated from mankind.</p>
<p>The work of a "fire ghost" is not as simple as people imagine, just putting out fires. They are also considered a batch of coolies on standby in the fire department. The fire truck is equipped with no less than hundreds of fire extinguishing equipment, large and small parts. Every day, these equipment and parts must be disassembled one by one and wiped clean with gasoline and yellow sand, making them shine brightly. Washing cars, washing floors, washing doors and windows, washing belts, all the sporadic and heavy work, there is nothing that the "fire ghosts" do not do. From morning to night, they work hard and rarely have free time. If you want to touch their hands, look! They are so rough and dry that they are simply like tree bark.</p>
<p>When the fire alarm bell rings clang clang, no matter in the daytime, at night, in the sweltering heat, or in the severe winter, dropping everything, they don't have time to run up the stairs, so they slide down the evacuation pillar (a vertical copper pillar that runs from the top floor to the bottom floor. To act quickly in case of fire, every firefighter holds onto this pillar and slides down), and climb onto the fire truck as if flying. The truck must leave the gate within five minutes of receiving the fire alarm report. Can it be done without being quick and agile?</p>
<p>Fighting a fire is like fighting against the enemy, charging into battle. Holding fire hooks and axes, and with the nozzle, they rush into the thick smoke and flames, into the fire pit. Who knows if flying bricks will crack open their heads or broken walls will break their legs, but they are not afraid to sacrifice! For the sake of protecting people's property and lives!</p>
<p>The word "freedom" seems to have lost its meaning in the fire department. Except for one day a week for "reporting for duty" (going out), they are not allowed to leave the fire station even one step from day to night. No matter how big the matter is, you are not allowed to go out until this day. If you "poke a hole in the skin" (go out privately), once discovered, you will be treated to a merciless "big meal" (severe punishment), alienated from relatives and friends, and rarely meet with your beloved wife.</p>
<p>For some reason, it is becoming more and more difficult to make money in Shanghai, the harder you work. "Fire ghosts" are certainly no exception. But their work is ultimately great in the social sense. "Rescuing the people from fire and water," don't underestimate them! (Payment)</p>
<h3>Incurable by Famous Doctors</h3>
<p>— Qian</p>
<p>Patient: Merciful doctor! For years, I have had dizziness and headaches, weak limbs, and lack of energy. Is there any special medicine to cure my illness?</p>
<p>Famous Doctor: (Pressing the pulse, observing the complexion) The five internal organs are not diseased, just a little lack of nutrition.</p>
<p>Patient: (Eagerly) Doctor! What should I do?</p>
<p>Famous Doctor: Not difficult! Not difficult! (Picking up the pen and writing a prescription, in one fell swoop:)</p>
<p>"Family Fortune Pot One</p>
<p>Vegetable Heart Meat Slice Pot One</p>
<p>Vinegar Glazed Yellow Croaker One</p>
<p>Three Fresh Soup Bowl One</p>
<p>Take two doses a day, guaranteed to be cured after ten days."</p>
<p>Patient: (Amazed) Ah! The monthly salary of one hundred and ten yuan is not enough to cover the food expenses of two adults and three children. How can I afford these twenty doses of expensive medicine! Famous Doctor: Hmm! This, this…………</p>
<h3>One Cent?</h3>
<p>— Ye Jiale</p>
<p>Eldest Brother: Father left a total of 100,000 yuan in cash. Let's divide it equally!</p>
<p>Second Brother: Good! Each person can get 33,333 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen. Then what about the remaining one cent? Third Brother: I think this one cent should be donated to a charity.</p>
<h3>The Boundary Between Boss and Employee</h3>
<p>— Shan Xiao</p>
<p>The night before last, a relative who works as a small clerk in a ×× company came to see me. As soon as he sat down, he talked about how the cost of living is so high, how can ordinary salaried people survive? It is especially difficult for him with his forty or fifty yuan salary: clothing, pocket money... and his wife at home often writes letters to urge him for money. Every month, he always runs a deficit. But if he had some capital, he wouldn't be in such a difficult situation now. This spring, he had persuaded a wealthy friend of his to buy a share of his company's stock. However, that friend calculated it and said: It's not worthwhile, because depositing in the bank also has a four or five percent interest rate, and it's also safe. But he was willing to subsidize his friend up to one and a half points, because the stock was in my relative's name, and at the end of the year, he could get a larger bonus because of this. However, that wealthy friend said: His company specializes in selling foreign goods. In the future, if the shipping routes are completely cut off, there will be nothing to sell. If there is nothing to sell, is the stock still worth anything? Besides, you can make money on anything now, why buy this dull stock?</p>
<p>My relative continued in frustration: If his friend had listened to him at the time, the stock that was previously worth 2,000 yuan would now be worth more than 3,000 yuan, and he would have received a few thousand yuan less in dividends at the end of the year. But he didn't listen to him, so he complained about his bad luck.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Life of Beating Out a Hero</p>
<p>"Of course, it's all very disheartening. Although Xiao Jiqing is a theater owner, he's actually quite kind-hearted. Knowing that telling Begonia directly would be very embarrassing, he deliberately beat around the bush. "However, as the saying goes, a great man can bend and stretch. If Boss Wu can understand the current situation, then I can honestly tell you.""</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Qian Ruomo knew that things were not good, but Begonia still tried his best to be patient.</p>
<p>"Mr. Xiao is right, as long as you are willing to give me food, I will do anything!"</p>
<p>"Let me talk about the stage first. In the official orchestra, the people are already complete! But if you force to add someone to beat the large gong or small gong, it is possible, but the salary is very low, only two to four yuan per month." Xiao Jiqing's words here made Begonia and Qian Ruomo's hearts grow cold simultaneously. "But according to that martial arts leader, a subordinate recently left the martial arts troupe; Boss Wu is also from a professional opera school, so he probably still knows how to do some tumbling and fighting. Their share will be larger than the stage. With my and Mr. Qian's connections, of course, we can offer better treatment than others; if you can be a subordinate, you can get forty-two yuan a month. If you can only be a superior, then thirty-four yuan is guaranteed, but…." (252)</p>
