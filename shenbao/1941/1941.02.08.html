<h3>開採西北油田</h3>
<p>自機械之動作，上翔於天，下潛於洋，於是發動機械之物質，力求質量輕而發揮力强者是用；遂由水進而為重油，為輕油，又於輕油之中，提煉分列等級，以供各種機械之運用。故機械化部隊無論如何其剛强，攻城奪壘若摧枯拉朽，出入火綱而履險如夷，終不可無油。因此之故，飛機所欲首先炸毀者，儲油之池；美國所欲禁止出口者，飛機之油；德人所以進駐羅馬尼亞國境者，為其有產油之區；日人所以悍然南進而似不惜孤注一擲者，正為求汽油等之取給。油者，乃成為舉世所仰給，各力求所爭逐，甚而為戰爭成敗之所繋。即在昔之平時，今之戰後，一切工業之復興，運輸之經營，亦將視油量蘊藏之豐嗇，以為轉移。遒者中國有出資七千萬，倂合美金三百萬，購辦機件，開發甘肅某地油礦之訉，由國家經營之，將以翁文灝氏為董事長，提煉各級汽油，以應國內需要。事在規畫之中。尙未實現，但以目前石油地位之重要，內地汽油供給之不便，自產自給，解決此難題，方惜其開辦太遲，抑何慮其不為事實耶。</p>
<p>西北多油礦，古代早日發現。在昔亦未嘗不有開採之議，正為人才經濟兩不足，而歷來發展經濟，投資經營，又多屬目於沿江沿海工商較盛之處；大好利源，埋沒已久，不為世重者，蓋此類也。自戰事西移，政軸內徒，人才薈萃，遂造成開發西南西北之機運。即就目前所可推想者，如長江中樞之漢口，下游之上海，白河之天津，戰後地位，均將無戰前之重要，而西南北與東南部之交通，自亦無以前之艱阻。故目前營營逐逐於孤島中之上海，方以為投資經營最利便穩妥之處者，　是當亦將恍然於其識見，誠幷底蛙之不啻歟。</p>
<p>一事業之成就，必具有開闢草萊，路襤褸之精神，偉大之實業家，莫不有遠大之識見，方有邁古超今之非常成就。中國之工商界，往往目光如豆，惜財如命，而急於近利，故其成就亦小。即以前偶有嘗試，輒遭失敗，於是對偉大之企業，更所寒心而不敢顧問。實則矢不中的，非弓矢之罪，而為操弓發矢者之無能，初非不可中也。猶憶光緒之世，振興工業，首先開辦之三新紗廠，竟肇焚如，而其失慎之原因，乃為運轉之地軸失於注油，　極發火所致也；夫地軸注油，在今之工人視之，藐不足奇，而在當時，則此種常識經驗，猶付缺如。同時浦東有鴻源紗廠，由某洋商所辦，人詢以營業如何？指工人而言曰須等到其子孫手裏；此何謂耶？蓋謂無熟練之工人，製品不精，產量不多，故難獲利，而熟練之工人，須經相當歲月養成之也。即此以概餘，中國工業之多失敗，正為無人才，或用非其才，才非所長；或一知半解，或粗知大略，於是少成就，遂使有志振興實業者灰心，投資經營者氣短。今以數十年經營，宜可矯前弊。以現狀而論，中國仍無大實業家，及大部分工業，猶操於外人之手，良可痛心。顧工業人才已非昔比，輓近西南各種工程之進行，已少假手客卿，大多數出於自力，且其成績亦不弱於人。而今西北油田之開採，經營於地質學家翁文灝氏之手，用得其才也；又得美人投資，機器等之採辦，無虞其陳腐也。煉油事業之在中國，為嶄新之企業，而油類之需求，方興未艾，利可操左券也。今雖出於國營，然如上海游資正患充斥，似此大利所在，鼓勵國人投資，亦難得之機會也。上海之工商界以及達商巨買，與其將雄厚之資金，呆存於銀錢業之庫中；或用以囤積居奇，擾亂市面危害民生，何如集合資力，結納人才，向西北去開發，地曠人稀，蘊藏未啓，茍善用之，前程至無涯涘。若以目前之繁榮為可流連，而忘却興業建國之大計，終必有着祖逖之先鞭，徒深望塵之遺憾，此中利害得失，寗待蓍卜耶！</p>

<p>歐戰業談（卅）（三）</p>
<h3>美國交上的秘聞</h3>
<p>現在先講美國在泛美洲會議所作的準備工作。一九三八年十二月初，汎美洲大會美國代表團一行，在國務卿赫爾領導之下，前往秘魯京城里瑪，參加會議，其目的即在樹立南北美洲共同陣綫。</p>
<p>赫爾到了里瑪，即分別把十九國代表聯絡好了，所難的束的只有巴西和哥倫比亞兩國代表，他們都倡議組織什麼西半球國際聯合會。其他如烏拉圭態度不定，阿根廷傾向英國，孤立主義特別濃厚，要算最難對付了。</p>
<p>阿根廷代表團係由該國外交部長康蒂　率領，此人狡猾性急，一到會就高唱大會應當嚴格的以討論　　各　事情爲限，但也贊成發表一個平凡的團結宣言，不附帶何條件。他同時宣佈，因爲健康關係，擬立即到智利湖濱休憇，所以要求大會從速決　，但赫爾不願草率從事，於是康蒂羅便悄然離去，弄得該國代表團羣能無首。</p>
<p>各報對於康蒂羅的離會，議論鼎沸，都說這是德國秘密工作人員的技倆。但康蒂　對於會中的情形，並非完全隔膜，終於提出一種方案，電達該國代表團，轉告赫爾。赫爾見其內容，與己意不謀而合，便向各國代表提出，卒由大會全體一致迪過。這就是所謂「里瑪宜言」，其遠大的意義厥在把美國所單獨創導的門羅主義，由南北美洲各國共同爲之保障，這是赫爾的莫大勝利。</p>
<p>羅　福總統在慕尼克會議之後，對於西半球和歐洲都決定採取積極政策，里瑪會議的成就，可說是這種決定的產物。但歐洲方面情形日非，不得不向希特勒採取各種和平攻勢</p>
<p>是年冬季，英法重整軍備如醉如在，情形一月比一月嚴重。英國駐美大使樂相於一九三九年一月問到任，會見總統，陳說歐局和解絕望。同時盛傳德國已要求比國在德軍進攻荷蘭時，係守中立。一時風聲鶴淚，好像德國立刻要向荷蘭展　閃電戰似的。這種恐怖旋告平息，到二月間又復發作，在這一起一伏戰爭恐怖之中，總統曾和海軍部長愛迪遜作過一次精確的推斷。</p>
<p>「却利」（愛迪遜的小名），總統說，「我們在度過今年夏天之前，總不免要看見世界重遭浩刦吧，我們已竭盡所能，從事弭戰了，我們畢竟不是抱個萬一之希望。」</p>
<p>「你想什麼時候會發作呢？」愛迪遜問。</p>
<p>「據我揣測，大的逃不過六月底七月初，」總統回答說</p>
<p>總統推行和平攻勢所引起的種種零星事件，有心人果然諒解他的苦衷，却有些人還以爲他好戰心切。一部份參議員不明事實眞相，且曾結隊到白宮，向總統探問究竟。總統歷歷繪述歐洲黑暗情形，謂戰事已迫在眉睫，並足以直接影響美國的安全。</p>
<p>總統繼又列舉歐洲各小國，如芬蘭，愛沙尼亞，拉達維亞，立陶宛，干蒂那維亞半島各國，波蘭，捷克，荷蘭，比利時及巴爾幹半島北部各國，都有捲人戰爭漩渦的危險。他最後父把談鋒轉到西半球，說英法荷三國的殖民地，散佈全球，這些屬地如果落在德國手中，戰禍便不知伊於胡底。總之，「富有」與「無有」兩個不同經濟集團的鬥爭，快要掀起世界大革命，美國雖有重洋遠隔，也不免被認爲「富有」國而遭人覬覦，「所以萊因河一帶呀！」</p>
<p>「你的意思是否說我們的邊界在萊因河？」一個參議員這樣問。</p>
<p>「並非如此。但切實施說，萊因河界倘使遭受威脅，世界其餘部份，也必遭受威脅。萊因河區域一且淪落，德國活動的範圍更將不可收拾了，」</p>
<p>但總統一番遠見，仍使一般參議員，疑信參半，孤立更從而中傷。總統依舊不能人諒解，廢止禁運軍火令一案仍告延擱。可是到三月十日，總統的各種預測，畢竟一一證實了。</p>
<p>這天，美國駐捷克公使卡爾來電報告，謂捷克政府已將斯洛伐族閣員中勾結德國主張斯洛伐克獨立的免職、兩天之後，柏林來雷證實希特勒嗾使　洛伐克族獨立。到了三月十五日晨三時五十五分，捷克總統哈嘉已在德國總理府向希特勒請降，晨六時，德軍已開　捷克波希米亞省，到了早餐時候，消息傳來，德軍已開入捷克京城了。</p>
<p>這時，英法也不再作和解的企圖，美國駐英法兩大使也同時報告和平絕望，非出於一戰不可。三月二十日，蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫通知美國駐蘇聯大使，謂英國曾探詢蘇聯政府，德國倘進攻羅馬尼亞，蘇聯態度如何。</p>

<p>厚薄粳等國米零星到貨、繼續不斷、而店舖納胃、依然不爽、所以市面平平、售價悉乏榮辱、常幫原特粳仍爲百零七元、斛見特百零二三元、崑山原白粳百零四五元、斛見百零一允至九十七元、靑角薄稻斛見九十四元半、九十四元、原包九十八元、</p>
<p>糯米去路雖較活動、無如懷貨者頗有脫出、致使供求相仿、售價猶乏變化、開香港白元八十元至七十八九元、</p>
<p>洋米繼續來滬、法國郵船公司貨輪開定（Kindai）號昨晨九時抵埠、由西貢直接裝來洋米一萬二千包、停靠虹口華順碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>洋粉已在途中</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日已見擯局、蓋自新年客銷活動以來、市面頗爲鞏固、投機囤戶亦有暗中收買、皆恐海外來源發生阻礙所致、昨據某洋行來電、澳洲粉途貨、首批將於二十日左右抵埠、又月底初亦有大批將到、是以人心怠懈、客胃轉淡、惟執貨者仍以國際變幻中、一時不願輕脫、故市面已入擯持狀態、上午花鳥鐘樓牌粉均無做開、迨後市始有少數成交、計開花鳥及鏑樓牌二十四元七八角、聚寶盆二十四元五六角、成交三千餘包、路貨仍開二十四元五角、二三月份二十四元左右、市面均在醞釀中、華廠平賣粉仍爲二十三元原盤、兩廠供給六千九百三十二包、本街需用、已感充裕、</p>
<p>小麥在此存到兩枯之際、華廠原料欲購不易、前定洋麥、雖已裝出、尚未運到、日廠門市收價仍爲一十二元至三十二元五六角、每日收進的二三百包、新年以來收進數量、亦不足萬包、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債驟漲　重行回小不少</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况驟見反動、在大戶新多頭及各幫補空中、市價驟回高一元有奇、德隆鴻大聯益買進甚湧、丙種價乃突穿出五元、惟信孚裕興又來賣出、德孚賣出亦多、價乃復走下風、聯和先入後出、同康先出後入、頗有舉棋不定之勢、協康仁昌雖有買進、而仁豐德昌及福昌仍有賣出、比高價復又回小五六角、目下行市經此番大跌之後、戊種較丙種相差幾及兩元之多、比之以前相差三四五角時、過於懸殊、故刻下以甲戊兩種爲便宜、甲種已定本月十日抽籤、此决爲第十一决、計需抽出三十六支之多、昨日結果、獨甲種反小五分、餘均略好二角至四角、九六亦好一角半、成交的有而百四十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新新公司股一百股、價爲二十一元七角半、</p>
<p>衆業股市收盤趨勢不定、浮多了結者甚衆、但同時補空者亦不乏人、有數種股票暫時似略趨軟、惟大致潛勢猶屬堅穩、橡皮股仍靜、</p>
<p>倫敦六日（週四）電、今日中國外債及英商逮東各公司股票掛牌行市、仍告平滯、祇滙豐銀行香港註冊股回跌落二鎊、價爲八十三鎊、其餘不動</p>
<h3>紗花　汕頭幫　套賣現紗　雙馬等均吿下落</h3>
<p>連日大上大下之紗市、昨則轉趨下降、此因客銷停頓、沙漁涌之運輸錢遭受阻碍、於是港幫束手不辦、至於汕頭幫反將昔日購進之現紗、削價求售、因之雜牌紗價、步步墮落、且跌勢甚劇也、惟多頭方面、仍竭力支持、故跌風尚能和緩、不過就大勢測之、暫時須迥旋一度、俟待現銷起色、市面再當向榮也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千五百十四元、低價爲一千四百八十三元、午後始做一千四百九十三元、後爲一千四百八十八元、昨有棉紗四百廿七件運香港、四十件運小呂宋、雙馬晨開、因廣幫客銷仍乏發展消息、塲中貿戶少勁、市態和平、首盤價爲一千五百零六元、此盤一開、賣勢益强、至於證劵幫多頭亦觀望、逐步跌至一千四百九十三元、低價一見、多方大家復來　相高抬、你叫我喊、復出五百元關外、爲一千五百十四元、豈料正在紛亂中、因現銷停頓、有一部份執雜牌紗者、鑒於出路閉塞、忽來套出、跌風驟起、直瀉至一千四百八十三元、收盤稍好、爲一千四百九十一元、查　日間成交統計九千包、儘係投機交易、客幫只包未曾成交也、</p>
<h3>棉市日淸</h3>
<p>現棉悄况隨紗市兒轉趨下游、廠方需要較爲减縮、實則價　雖步步上升、然紗市因銷路停頓、客幫將現紗吐出、所以原料帶疲、</p>
<p>紐約棉市靜而堅、因有現貨商買進及同業買進而見漲、結界較之上日收盤價格上昂約三五磅音、</p>
<p>印棉平疲、昨日連同預測低落一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日仍因各方均取觀望之態、購買者寥寥無幾、故市况平靜、又轉進呆滯地步、唯此僅一時之遲疑、不足阻塞活躍之棉市、預料熱鬧之期、仍不遠也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布街銷發動</h3>
<p>廠布咋市平穩、本街現交易漸有發展、客銷因運輸不便、購胃淡薄、售盤粗布跌每疋二角半之譜，細布斜紋平平、漂染布亦少軒輊、本街成交各布六百餘件、浙閩幫辦粗布色布色斜等一百餘件、粵港幫辦府綢色布等二百餘件、風外星加坡等地辦漂布色布等五千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布白貨細布細斜交易不旺、廻旋下挫、每疋跌二角半至五角、十二磅龍頭細布現貨收盤五十元零一角、後市暗盤做開五十元零二角、四君子嗶嘰一元三角五分、「取引所」龍頭期貨一月份收盤五十元零八角、二月份五十二元三角、四月份五十一元四角九、五月份五十四元一角、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價不振</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢繼續轉平、公會劃盤、二四粗白外棧現貨無成交、期貨均跌數角、本月十交割八十一元角至二角、小四角、本月二十五日打單八十一元七角、小二角、下月十日打單八十二元二角、小二角、下月十二日打單八十二元一角、車白上下檔均小三角、太古B嘜西棧八十一元、東棧八十元七角、DY嘜西棧七十八元六角、HX嘜西棧七十八元五角、</p>
<h3>雜項　火柴肥皂　上騰未已</h3>
<p>火柴行盤市價、仍爲原料恐慌、廠方無大量供給、同業因存底漸少、故買價向上、刻市如鳳凰牌每箱至四百二十元、美麗牌四百二十五元、二等雜牌三百九十元、三等雜牌三百七十元、比較歲底漲起四十餘元、人心仍看高俏、</p>
<p>肥皂市價行盤挺秀、廠方派貨仍寥寥岸屆出令、執貨者不願脫手、致價漸漸向榮、固本皂　箱市售已至二十六元八角、黃祥茂皂每箱十九元八角、白祥茂皂每箱二十四元、還看上漲、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆供求不勻</h3>
<p>邇來黃豆山况、久處於堅硬局面、原因北方匯水關係、販運轉稀、來源减色、雖去路有而不暢、但貨主因木高利薄、行情依然無鬆動之意、昨市在香港厦門汕頭本街辦胃殷勤之情形下、不爲油餅受某國謠言而趨疲風、結果反比上日漲起四五角不等、計成交天津豆六千餘包、價爲四十元零五角至四十一元、宵島豆二千包、價爲三十八元三角至三十八元五角、歸德互二千餘包、價爲一十六元八角至三十七元、及天津靑豆三百包、價爲三十五元七角、崇明沙黃九十包、價爲三十六元五角云、七日出口豆子有三百八十五包運香港、一百五十包運小呂宋、七千一百九十包　新加坡、又芝蔴二百九十包連香港、六十包　小呂宋、</p>
<h3>五金　純銻鋼條劇漲</h3>
<p>純銻　國產純銻、最近因來源斷檔、市存極微、標準節節上漲、大有無貨可購之虞、査昨市喊價每噸已昂至一萬一千元、較之紅盤又高一千元矣、</p>
<p>鋼條　竹節鋼條交易雖未見熱鬧、（因建築幫及北路客商採辦均甚淸淡、）然市氣却異常良好蓋海外定貨告絕、到貨亦無、所能支持市面者、僅靠本埠所存而已、故同業心思良佳、行盤劇漲、刻每噸開二千四百元左右云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　開平煤步降</h3>
<p>烟煤行情、自印度煤回降以後、次等貨亦隨之帶小、昨日某公司有開平煤大批塞出、且熱水業平價煤亦同時發給、暗盤未免遜色、　見下游、開平煤火車塊每噸、二百十五元、較紅盤回落五元、開平屑二百六十四元、棧單出貨、現鈔交易、</p>
<h3>念九年份之上海粉市（續）  周錫賡</h3>
<p>上述諸廠之出品到申發售，因其粉牌龐雜，名之曰「雜牌粉」。除太和，廣豐，增豐，民豐　，泰豐等廠自行管理外，餘皆</p>
<p>三興麵粉公司東福麵粉廠鎭江麵粉廠有恒麵粉廠</p>
<p>恒豐麵粉廠華友製粉公司</p>
<p>强身麵粉公司</p>
<p>七家管理之。並由</p>
<p>三井物產　三菱商事新井洋行吉田號東福產業公司大同公司福大公司橫山洋行增幸洋行永和洋行瀛華洋行中日實業公司</p>
<p>十二家分別代理小麥麵粉及麩皮與其他副產品之發售與購　。去年夏秋之交，內地麵粉，除由日方統制傾銷華北，華中，華南各市塲外，所有餘額，尚可運申競售。是時滬地本廠粉價在十三元五角，而內地粉到申，每包連費只十三元左右，致右干粉商，異想天開，以上海各粉廠之粉袋，擇其商標之受人歡迎者，實以內地粉廠之粉，改頭換面，僞充上海粉廠之出品。如以內地粉到申每包十三元，加掉換本廠粉袋費一角左右，照本廠粉價格每包售十三元五角餘，其間可得純益四角餘，較之祗以眞正之本廠粉經　，而得之手續費每包數分者，誠不可同日而語矣。但換袋（亦稱改包）手續，大有高低，狡黠者手術精良，粉包縫口，宛如原封未動；技術拙劣者，固能一望而知係換袋粉也。一般用戶，每不知底蘊，受給實多。又有若干粉商，在換袋之際，竊取麵粉半磅至一磅不等，設以換袋百包計，每包偷取半磅計，從中可餘五十磅麵粉，若以每包十三元計之，豈非又多一包之數。（如以目下廿四元餘之價格而言，獲利當倍之），更有貪心之粉商，以决等粉若干，和以上等粉，相合拌和後，灌入本廠粉袋後，陳列出售，利益之厚，可想而知。而眞正之本廠粉，銷化被阻滯。至九月間，內地粉及滬郊諸廠之粉，不准運人租界，（有少數經脚踏車自南翔經閘北一帶轉輾車來，但屬有限，未幾，亦告停止）故自後內地之雜牌粉，即行絕跡於租界矣、</p>
<p>（四）麵粉黑市與粉價</p>
<p>當上海粉市緊俏之時，上海各商號向澳洲定成巨額洋粉，的有一百五十萬包之譜，每包到申價格，最廉者爲十六元五角左右，最高者爲十八元五角左右，蓋由外匯變動之故，價格致有參差。至去年十二月止，已有五十萬包左右到埠，其餘當於今年二三一四月三個月份中，陸續來滬。　理，粉市有　接濟，市况可望平靜，然實際囚上海粉廠之原料，無豐厚積儲，加之內地雜牌粉又禁止來申，米價節節上升，投機者遂着眼於麵粉之購囤。惟本廠粉籌碼極少，於是到申之洋粉，爲若輩唯一之投機目標。麵粉黑市，每日上午二市，例假日休息，洋粉價格自十九元左右，抬至廿四元八角之多，是項交易，已越供需範圍，而入於瘋在之投機狀態矣。至麵粉黑市之形成，爲若干粉麩從業員戰　失業之故，在愛多亞路上海雜糧油餅交易所棋上，闢一角地，始爲叙談而已，</p>

<h3>「滬西特警」將成立　北區警權待解決　正副「署長」經雙方任定　取締賭窟問題或有困難</h3>
<p>昨晚據可靠方面消息、工部局已接「市政府」通知、任命潘志傑爲「滬西特別警察署總署長、」同時工部局已舉薦克立沙爲「副總署長、」所有經工部局舉薦之人員、將陸續公布、據日方傳出消息、滬西「特別警察總署、預定下月一日、即可正式成立、「署長」潘志傑、現正開始籌備、前日上午十時、曾訪工部局總董凱自威·總辦費利溥。總巡鮑恩、接洽一切、</p>
<p>組織問題　尙待商討</p>
<p>據官方所發表之公報稱、工部局今日任命警察長賀爾爲「特警外事科長」、警長勃倫金沙任「刑事科長」、若干方面相信、「特警」將於下月月初成立、然官方對該事表示緘默、據稱、在「特警」開始行使職權以前、尚有若干細節、現正待潘志傑月內與「副署長「克立沙開會、對於組織「特警」之種種問題、作最後階段之討論、諸如各部人數·「分署」地點。服制。等等、作最後之決定、</p>
<p>禁絕罪惡　恐多阻梗</p>
<p>據聞公共租界當局批准任命特警「副總署長」後、雙方不久即交換批准對方所任命之人員、然關於關閉歹土賭窟及其他罪惡組織與徵稅問題、並無公告發表、若干方面相信徵稅不致發生困難、因所收得之款項、係專供該區之需要、關於關閉賭窟及其他罪惡，活動一事、則若干方面表示、此事將發生若干困難、</p>
<p>西區治安　新警負責</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據權威方面今日所傳出之消息稱、滬西新「特別警力」組織以後、越界築路之一切「額外警力」、皆將取消、據聞、該區之警務活動、今後由「新警力」單獨負責、並將立卽採取辦法、使極司非爾路「特務機關」、不久卽可邏出該屋、同時該處之「市府」「警察」及西區日本憲兵隊、亦將停止活動、關於關閉該區賭窟及其他犯罪活動之談判、據聞不久卽將由「警署署長一潘志傑及工部局所任命之「副署長」克立沙一人談判之、</p>
<p>克立沙氏　服務經歷</p>
<p>新任一特警副總署長」克立沙、係一九一四年加入警務處服務、一九二四年曾得長期服務之獎章、爲工部局警務處諸服務最長人員之一、克氏自低微之職務、遂漸升遷、至一九三六年任新閘捕房警長之職、最近始被任爲「特警副總署長、」克氏善運動、甚聞名本市之運動界、</p>
<h3>北區警權　亟待商決</h3>
<p>昨日關係方面官稱、鑒於滬西越界築路之正常警務將漸决完全恢復租界北區「新警區」之設立、卽名之爲「戊區者、勢將於最短期內宣告實現、按此「新警區」乃於去年由前日總領三浦通告建議、渠於同時並參予工部局前總董樊克令及傅筱庵訂立滬西警權之臨時協定、據三浦之意、「新警區」之設立、將使北區恢復正常狀態、因此區計之劃一日副總巡暨數日捕治理之也、</p>
<p>捐稅損失　數日浩大</p>
<p>昨日工部局及日當局聲稱、關於此問題之談判、現已「延擱」其原因、則未說明、但昨晨官方表示、一俟滬西「特警」設立圓滿實現、工部局與日當局即重行談判、解決「戊區」警權問題、據悉目前北區因被日方「佔據」之故、所有「華中城市公共汽車公司」之公共汽車的二百五十輛、暨其他汽車一千輛與人力車等之執照費、工部局皆不能微收、兩年半來、捐稅損失每年達二百萬元、雖北區之局勢、反常一至於此、但工部局仍繼續担負該區修路及警務之責、亦云寃矣、按現下北區情形、公共租界巡抽、皆不得武裝上差、</p>
<h3>凱自威　赴港小憩　董卡納明日返美</h3>
<p>工部局總董凱自威、於上月二十三日被林雄吉擊傷、左手傷勢、迄未全愈、仍用黑紗包紮、懸於頸間、現以納稅大會結束、爲易地休養計、特向局請假、於昨晨偕夫人搭門羅總統號赴港、即於月內返滬、又副董卡納、年老退休、於明晚搭克里拉輪號歸美、其遺缺業由太古公司總經理米契爾繼任、</p>
<h3>婦孺總會明日舉行　盛大慈善茶舞</h3>
<p>中國救濟婦孺總會籌募捐款委員會主辦全滬舞星慈善茶舞大會、定於明日下午三時至八時、假座麥特赫司脫路麗都舞廳舉行、屆時由虞洽卿袁履登聞蘭廳揭幕、慮文英剪綵、</p>
<p>贈獎辦法</p>
<p>該會爲鼓勵各舞塲舞星參加慈善荼舞、依其　銷舞票成績、訂定贈奬辦法如下、（一）參加慈善茶舞舞星、均由中國救濟婦孺總會贈送觀音紀念獎章、（二）勸銷舞票五百元或五百元以上者、加贈紀念銀盾一座、（三）勸銷舞票一千元或已千元以上者、加贈觀音大士像一尊、（四）勸銷舞票三千元或三千元以上者、加贈紀念匾額、（五）勸銷舞票五千或五千元以上者、加贈紀念匾額外、並再加贈巨型大士像一座、上項獎品、定期舉行贈獎典禮贈送之、</p>
<h3>存米百萬包以上　民食可無顧慮　防止漲價仍在取締囤積　香港米運照常市場謠息</h3>
<p>昨日米市、因連日來貨蜂湧、與具有豐厚之存底、使米價連續趨下，價已回平、一般預計本月份內、洋米運抵之總數、的達百萬包、與現有之存底合計、本市存米之總數、可達一百四五十萬包、將突破本市存米之最高紀錄、而三月份裝業已訂定之洋米、已達一三十萬包、</p>
<p>穩定米市　已具效果</p>
<p>公共租界當局每遇米價高漲時、卽敦動米業團體及各業大量訂購洋米、但到數從未有目前之鉅者、故當局對穩定本市食米之措置、已收有顯著之效果、此後米價當可穩定、惟須予以注意者、（一）鉅額洋米抵滬後、如何防止囤戶收　、從而操縱市價、（二）進制出口、（三）取締影響米市之謠言、因無稽謠傳、在市塲傳播，足以影響米價也、</p>
<p>當局建議　似係舊案</p>
<p>昨報載工部局為防止糧食之囤積居奇、與投機起見、業經准如糧食委員會之建議、向米市塲管理委員會提出七項辦法、促其實施、記者特於昨日下午叫時、向該會探詢眞相、據稱、該會迄昨日止、並未接有工部局之是項建議、記者復叩詢熱悉米市之某君、據稱報載工部局建議之七項辦法中之大部份、即係去年六月八日法公董局平價會向公共租界糧食委員會建議之調整米市新八法、</p>
<p>杜絕投機　早經施行</p>
<p>據記者之可靠調查、目前米市塲採取防止投機之嚴峻辦法、而早經予以施行者、爲（一）加入米市塲營業者、限爲（甲）米行業公會會員、（乙）米號業公會會員、（丙）經售業公會會員、（丁）掮客聯誼社社員、新會員入塲營業時、須由兩家同業保證、掮客聯誼社於未成立之前、加入市塲營業、亦須作保、成立後則改由該社負責、（二）市塲於前年（二十八年）九月間即已實行米糧成交後須塡寫成進單與賣主塡寫成出單、與買方成交之總數、逐日報告當局、（三）前月間豆米公會曾議決米糧成交　、交貨日期由十天縮短為五天、並須預付定洋五元、過期則予沒收、</p>
<p>敦勸各業　續訂洋米</p>
<p>至關於存貨到貨之最新統計、上海市米糧評價會業已有此項工作、但並未能臻精確程度、因洋米到貨尚能統計　國米來源則並不集中一處、甚難計算、而現行購貨至少十包之辦法、仍應維持之議、與未到　之米糧交易、應僅限於可靠之批發米商等議、則尚須予以斟酌、總之、目下穩定米市之辦法、仍在敦勸各業直接向外洋訂購洋米、以充實本市存底、取締無稽謠言、以防止米價上漲、而從速續辦平糶、亦足以穩定本市米價也、</p>
<p>香港未　禁米出口</p>
<p>前日米市場盛傅、香港當局爲米雨綢繆計、復又下令、禁止米糧出口、及停止簽發米糧轉口證、以致人心忐忑、一般米商認為香港若禁止米糧出口、則運滬洋米、將愈趨减尠、爰異貨居奇、不肯將所有現貨輕易脫手、尚待善價而沽、市况不無緊俏、今已證實該項謠言純屬無稽之談、端係投機米蠢之故佈是非、企圖抬價漁利、今探錄昨日某米行接獲香港同業電文如下、「來電悉、港米並未禁止出口、定貨尚在裝輸、日內可啟椗」、又外傅近來每日下午仍有一辦米商在愛多亞路十五號雜糧油餅交易所、私做米糧交易、攸關民食前途匪淺、務望有關方面予以嚴厲取締、果屬實則該業公會應明知其事、而守缄默、誠不勝遺憾</p>
<h3>工董改選日期　業經領團核准　西僑實力雄厚可維現狀　日方競選企圖殊無把握</h3>
<p>工部局董事會、前日向領事團建議、定四月二日三日爲工部局董事改選之期、此議已於昨日由領袖領事希爾核准、現工部局擬於日內再向領團提出於四月十六日召集納稅外人年會、一俟核准、當即通知各納稅人、並即飭秘書處書各部進行籌備事宜、</p>
<p>美僑方面　昨有會商</p>
<p>昨日下午、美僑協會路美國總會召集執行委員特別會議、由會長麥克美倫主席，除對一般會務作概括之檢討外、爲策動競選工部局董事之準備工作計、並商定應付方策、又推出候選董事數人、至人數及姓氏、則尚未發表、衆信此等候選董事、必爲美僑中之知名之士、殆無疑義、英僑方面亦將於日內在外灘廿七號英僑協會召集會議、其主耍議程、亦即爲推定候選局董五人、</p>
<p>英美陣綫　仍將獲勝</p>
<p>據其觀察家談、按歷年選舉手續、係根據　涇浜地皮章程第十八條之規定自一八六九年以來、始終未加變更、通常工部局之選舉、在選舉日（二日）之上午十時至下午三時舉行投票、由工部局指定之監票員檢票、以得票最多之九人、當選爲下屆董事、此種制度、迄今未有改變、故預料競選結果、亦不致有多大之變更、因西人投票之實力、與日僑成傘與一之比、邇來虹口之日僑人數、雖日有增加、但擁有資產最多者、仍爲英美人士也、目下日方態度如何、尚難確定、彼等似正計劃採取一新政策、然能吾壓倒英美方面、以達其佔董事五席之企圖、日方亦未必有甚大之把握、</p>

<h3>殺人未遂要犯　林雄吉竟保釋　日領署初審部份已結束　將解長崎法院公開審理</h3>
<p>上月二十三日納稅外人大會中開槍狙擊工部局總董凱自威之兇手日僑民會會長林雄吉自逮捕送交日領館警察署覊押究辦　、業已自承行兇不諱、迄今已有二星期之久、如此重大國際性之謀殺兇犯、據日文報紙所載、現林雄吉已於五日重開納稅外人大會之翌日（六日）由日領館保釋出外、待公開審判有日、再行送往日本長崎候審、</p>
<p>預審吿終　候解長崎</p>
<p>林雄吉之殺人未遂被吿事件、由一月二十五日送交司法當局預審迄今、業已告終、不久將解送日本長崎地方法院公開審理、林在預審中、對於犯罪事實、業巳直認不諱、且亦頗具悔意、現雖許予保釋出外、僅能謹愼深居、誓不作湮滅罪證或逃亡之行爲</p>
<p>出領署後　參神拜佛</p>
<p>林得保釋之許可後、由其妻暨親友安林源吾等、於六日午後五時五十分許、馳赴日領館送換衣服、乘四六七三號自備汽車而出、先至東本願寺慰祖、繼至西本願寺、再至北四川路海軍墓地上海神社參拜後、於六時四十分回歸賓樂安路自宅、從事靜養、以待正式審判，對於殺人未遂案件、默無一語、</p>

<p>敎育</p>
<h3>留級</h3>
<p>— 左</p>
<p>『我說再過幾年給他上學，不是根好的嗎？」</p>
<p>『六歲正是該上學的年齡，爲什麼要再過幾年呢？」</p>
<p>『依你的話，六歲上學，那麼現在留級了，你爲什麼又要怪他呢？』</p>
<p>『是呀，因爲他已是六歲了，所以留級就該——哼，」父親很氣，氣得好一回說不出話，直到像一隻老鷹般的把他的孩子抓住的時候，才說：「已經六歲了呢，還要留級，人家五歲的也要比你……</p>
<p>話沒說完，母親把孩子奪過去了。孩子今天跟父親領了成績報告單一同回家，在路上被駡得一個够。他不敢說話，幾乎要哭出來，但是又恐怕父親打他；他忍着，一直忍到家裏，快快奔向母親的懷裏躱。母親是最疼他的，當然可以做他的保鏢；但是父親始終不肯罷休。他從來不曾看見父親發過偌大的脾氣，現在他簡直嚇得像一隻淋過水的小鷄。</p>
<p>「嚇，你還要把他當一個寶貝，」父親咆哮着：「把他摟在懷裏。』</p>
<p>「把他當一個寶貝又怎的呢？』母親用手指梳着孩子的髮。</p>
<p>『把他當做寶貝，就是你這樣弄壞的：打麻將了，叫他立在你的身邊，開學的時候，「小貓跳」三個字始終認不得，「中發白」倒是頂頂認識的。晚上跟你一起睡，起碼十點半，有時遲到十二點；第二天早晨，有時人家上過第一課了，還只到校。星期日，帶他到旅館去，戲院去，親戚家去，我也從來不曾看見他好好地在家裏　過書。你是他的母親嗎？你是什麼母親？』</p>
<p>『是的，隨你說去，我不是他的母親，誰是呢？他爲什麼偏偏跟我一起不愛跟你一起呢？你這個好爸爸。』做母親的不想多說了。</p>
<p>好一回，大家的氣似乎平了一些，母親問孩子說：『你，你考第幾名？』</p>
<p>『第幾名？第四十二名，你的寶貝考四十二名。」父親狠狠地代替孩子回答。</p>
<p>『那麼比他不好的還有呢！」住一住，母親俯下頭來溫柔地向孩子說：『你們一級裹不是有五十個人嗎？」</p>
<p>『是的。』孩子懦怯地有些嗚咽。母親還想說，父親粗大的聲音把母親的話頭打斷了：『唉，你道個母親，你說得好，「比他不好的還有呢』虧你說得出，你難道一定要他考第五十名？』父親的火又復燃了。</p>
<p>那時，樓上的鄰居走下來勸解了：『楊先生，你別吵了，孩子那裏懂得呢！』</p>
<p>「正因爲他不懂得呢！所以做娘的該敎敎他才好呀；可是，她的兒子留了級，考了第四十二名，你想她怎麼說，她說，「比他不好的還有呢！」晦，這是敎兒子的方法？』</p>
<p>勸解的拍拍孩子的背說：「你看，你的爸爸爲了你氣得多麽的苦，爸爸出錢給你讀書，你該好好的，不耍留級。』</p>
<p>母親把孩子推給勸解的，自己忽忽地向房裏跑，嘴裡　着：『你去說吧，你是好爸爸，你是好—』</p>
<p>過一回，勸解的領着孩子上樓去了，說道：「楊先生，別氣了吧，我叫孩子下决用功點去。』</p>
<p>於是留下楊先生一個人孤單單地在客堂裏，想着他的孩子，想着這樣的母親，想着環境，想着家庭敎育，想着……</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>我的永遠的家</h3>
<p>— 二維</p>
<p>我控着欲滴的淚，讀完了南人女士的「女人難做」。女人眞是個不吉祥的東西嗎？的確，這是我所不能吾認的。</p>
<p>我雖也是個中等家庭的女子，但在我十八歲初中二年級那年，父親就把求學的優先權讓與哥哥了。『女子就是大學畢業，三從四德也不見得比不識字的高妙，省得知識深了出花樣。」從舊的社會制度生長起來的他老人家，還常用這樣的話敎訓我。</p>
<p>『爲什麽女子就不能和男人一樣，讀書做事，難道女人就不是人嗎？』我曾用這反話駁過他。</p>
<p>「你們女子是無能的，你不見女人都是依靠男人過活的嗎？」我的反駁倒引起了他的高明見識。</p>
<p>我的學校生活就算告一結束，這我也不能怨恨父母的命令，我只有憎惡舊的社會制度和我的命運。我靠着眼淚維持自己寂寞的生活，幫助母親料理一些家事，學一點所謂女人應懂的「規矩」。還不錯，風平浪靜地過了幾個月，誰料到痛心的事又迎頭襲來。父親拿了紅帖對母親命令似的說：『維兒年紀已不小，張家又來催過門，依算命先生說下月二十日是吉日……』這幾個字迎風吹來，好像在用針刺我的心。我這時又被淚水所包圍了。恰巧母親也走進來，看見我這種狼狽的樣子，用不自然的語調安慰我說，「維兒！橫豎女人長大是要出嫁的，你也不必傷心，也許那邊的日子還好過一點。」她也哭了。</p>
<p>以後我寂寞傷心時，就拿母親的話來溫暖自己的心。雖然明知道這話不能成爲事實，但我也懷着滿腔的希望，幻想着那快樂的境域，不曾相識丈夫的慰安，才稍微放心。</p>
<p>時光是這麽地快，我終於脫離了眞心愛我的慈母的懷抱，進到這比沙漠上還要枯乾的所謂我永久的家了。受了些婆娘的敎訓，聽了些不願聽的話，做了些不願做的事；吃了無數决的白眼，丈夫無情底愛的罪惡。以前我的夢想，至今已完全幻滅了，我又有什麽法子來拯救自己呢？只有聽從命運的播弄了。誰叫你生成一個女人呢？我又自己咒自己。</p>
<p>記得有一决，因頭痛得利害沒出屋，當然又是受了婆娘的駡，恰巧又値爹爹買米回來，他又在我身上出氣了，『整天裝病，米都九十塊錢一担了，耍沒有我，你們不知早餓到什麽地步！無能下賤的東西！』</p>
<p>「女人眞是無能的嗎？眞是不吉祥的東西嗎？」我問自己，終於找不出一個圓滿的答復。</p>
<p>姊妹們，爲了後來的妹妹們，我們得撕毀這陳腐的舊社會制度！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>然而世界上，有幾個人是可以料到未來的一切的？</p>
<p>七月三日的上午，女師的五週紀念會終於在一所古舊的大禮堂裏舉行了；天氣是非常的陰沉，好像老天也知道將有一個純潔的少女，要在道個集會上，遭到惡運了。灰黑色的雲片，遮滿了天空，好好的一個早上，變得像傍晚一樣。</p>
<p>來賓照例只是很少的幾個地方長官和紳士之流，連學生的家長在內，也不過三四十人。一霎眼，時鐘不覺已打過九下，學生和先到的來賓，一齊走進禮堂去了，侯校長却還在應接室外的廊下，很焦急地鵠候着。因爲這一决的典禮中，胡督軍和在省長兩位，都是萬不能少的偶像，而且事先他們都答應準到，但現在除掉在省長已由馬敎育廳長伴同到會之外，胡督軍却還是芳蹤杳然。</p>
<p>「侯校長，現在已經快九點一刻了，我們要不要先開會？敎務主任洪先生，跫到她面前來，悄悄地問。</p>
<p>終年拱腰縮肩，眉尖深鎖，臉上不見一絲笑容的侯校長，現在是顯得更憂鬱了；湊着上面密雲不雨的天色，眞會令人立刻幻想到這裏將有一幕悲劇要展開了。</p>
<p>她把十條鳥爪似的手指，亳無感覺地互相搓捏着，無法答復洪敎務主任的詢問，因爲不等胡督軍駑到而先開會，道是無疑的會使他不歡的；但儘讓汪省長和馬敎育廳長等一干人在這裏枯坐，却也有些說不過去，這就使她够爲難了！</p>
<p>「唉！對於這些人眞沒有辦法！」她低下頭去，嘆息着說。</p>
<p>直到又過了二十多分鐘，洪敎務主任又來催問了四五遍，侯校長急得快要暈過去了，—眞像三十年前她在故鄉天天盼望她未婚夫從拳匪中逃出，而始終不曾得到半些消息一樣。—空氣裏才傳來了一陣皮鞋的響聲，接着那老門房便氣喘如牛的引進了七八個全副武裝的傢伙來。　（二五）</p>

<p>逰藝界</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>天外流鶯</h3>
<p>— 程冰奴</p>
<p>葛璐麗琪安是環球公司預備大捧特捧的童昨，原因是狄安娜寶萍已經到了演成人戲的階段，琪安的歌喉和臉蛋，嚴格地說起來，是抵不上寶萍的。可是她年紀輕，而且天資聰穎，假以時日，也許可以取寶萍而代之。</p>
<p>這大概就是「乳鶯出谷」之後，再來一部「天外流鶯」的原因。「天外流鶯」的故事，一定是為了琪安而幻想起來的，寫一個大家庭裏的小孫女，被人發覺有歌唱的天才，請到電台上去播音，而她的老祖父卻堅決反對，經過了一些波折，終於達到了目的，這個小孫女便大紅大紫起來。但這樣簡單的劇情，也許會使觀眾感到單調，於是正如廣告中所說「伯伯叔叔一大淘，姊姊一意談情愛俏」，而使這個劇本熱鬧起來。</p>
<p>不錯，「天外流鶯」是夠熱鬧的，熱鬧是它的最大特色。除了琪安之外，其餘配角，如洛勃史丹克，許赫勃，奧勃萊史密士，南葛蕾等，可說都屬一時之選。好得人人都有戲做，而且也並不像其他美國片的一味胡鬧，這是「天外流」監製人裘派斯脫納克可愛的地方。再就好的方面說，還有各面人物個性的鮮明，如老祖父的暴躁，大姊的多情，以及父親的糊塗等，都刻畫得維妙維肖。在「乳鶯出谷」中初顯身手的丙個小壞蛋-蒲弟，在這裏也頑皮得可愛。這兩個傢伙，將來是會成為喜劇明星的。至於琪安的演技，沒有特另出色，但很平衡，她的歌唱，現在是還及不上寶萍的。</p>
<p>看過「天外流鶯」，第一個印象，便是熱鬧有趣，但這熱鬧有趣，當你離開了戲院之後，就不會存在的了，因為它的情節差不多是由這些熱鬧所支撐的。</p>
<p>聯合口琴隊播音</p>

<h3>上海不映「逃亡」</h3>
<p>— 惠霖</p>
<p>米高梅的反納粹片</p>
<p>米高梅公司反納粹片「逃亡」（Escape），據說運到上海之後經試映過，不會有放映的希望了。這本小說單在美國已經銷去了二十一萬冊，和「隨風而去」（即「亂世佳人」同被認為最佳銷路的書本。）</p>
<p>攝成影片的「逃亡」是羅勃泰格和瑙瑪希拉初度合演，由娜捷瑪娃，斐立浦唐和康拉懷德配演。他的故事是寫一個美國少年藝術家為了營救被拘於集中營裏的母親而吃盡千辛萬苦，其中穿插了伯爵夫人，某將軍及獄醫等角色。</p>
<p>羅勃泰洛飾藝術家，大約仍是一貫「魂斷藍橋」的作風，瑙瑪希拉自「女人」一片後久未問世，這裏也不會使人失望吧。</p>
<p>值得提起的是斐立浦唐，他飾獄醫一角，很滑稽－他是個從荷蘭來的伶人，十個月前到好萊塢時候還不會說英語，但是他每天瞧三張或四張影片，由一個英文教師陪著指導，所以現在他能講很準備的英語了。斐立浦唐的臉倒很又些像保羅茂尼呢（見圖）。至於飾母親的娜捷瑪娃是二十年前默片時代的著名女星，「逃亡」是她重返銀幕後的第一部作品，可惜由於她年齡的無情已限制了的發展。</p>
<p>想不到看過「大破納粹間諜網」這張影片的影迷們現在竟會無緣看到這張「逃亡」了。</p>

<p>海燕，這小姑娘的名字，好像有點生疏，不過看過她的戲或認識她的人，誰都不能否認她是一個天才的演員。</p>
<p>本月四日的是午，她在南洋戲劇社裏演出，她演的是「裝腔作勢」的淑貞，成績頗佳，活活的刻畫一個醉心摩登的小姑娘，雖她的姿態好像是一位摩登小姐，嫵媚婀娜，但是這裏值得人們贊同的，就是她那充滿著孩氣的雙瞳和那隻可愛的小嘴，表現出一個還未完全脫落孩氣的小姑娘，所以她最大的成功也就在這裏。她是一個聰明的孩子，希望她自己加一分的努力吧。</p>

<p>Chongqing – Roosevelt's personal envoy, Currie, has arrived here by plane from Hong Kong, accompanied by Mr. Despres, Chairman Chiang's representative Dong Xian Guang, and Mr. Pond of Pan American Airways. When the plane landed, a large group of representatives from the National Government's administrative departments and public organizations were there to welcome them. Currie and Despres, upon disembarking, were led across the river by representatives of the U.S. Embassy to the south bank. During their stay in Chongqing, they will be guests of U.S. Ambassador Johnson. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Roosevelt's personal envoy, Currie, paid a visit to Chairman Chiang this afternoon and presented President Roosevelt's handwritten letter. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Roosevelt's Administrative Advisor Dr. Currie and economic expert Mr. Despres arrived here by special plane from Hong Kong at 8:30 this morning. Dr. Currie will reside at the private residence of U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson. Dr. Currie had breakfast at Ambassador Johnson's residence. He will cross the river this afternoon to personally present President Roosevelt's letter to Chairman Chiang. Dr. Currie and Mr. Despres left Hong Kong at 4:00 AM this morning (Chongqing time) and arrived here four and a half hours later. Also traveling with them were Vice Minister of Propaganda Dong Xian Guang and an employee of the airline company. The plane landed safely as the dawn was just breaking. (Associated Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – U.S. President Roosevelt's representative Currie paid his respects to Chairman Chiang at 4:00 PM today and presented President Roosevelt's handwritten letter and a recently signed photograph. They talked for over 20 minutes in a very pleasant atmosphere. Vice President Kong and Foreign Minister Wang were also present at the time. Afterwards, Currie went to the residences of Kong and Wang for formal visits. Tomorrow, he will also visit Minister of Communications Zhang Jia'ao, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao, and Minister of Propaganda Wang Shijie. During his stay in Chongqing, Mr. Currie will try to minimize social engagements to have more time to talk with Chinese authorities. Therefore, the planned itinerary only includes banquets by Vice President Kong and the Sino-American Cultural Association. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – Roosevelt's personal envoy, Currie, flew to Chongqing this morning and will stay in Chongqing for three weeks to gather first-hand information on China's economic situation. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Brief History of Roosevelt's Administrative Assistant Dr. Currie</p>
<p>Chongqing – Currie was born in Nova Scotia, Canada, on October 8, 1902. He went to the United States in 1925. In 1927, he married Ms. Dorsay and had four sons. He became an American citizen in 1934. In 1937, he obtained a bachelor's degree from the School of Economics and then served as a lecturer and tutor at Harvard University. He obtained a doctorate from Harvard University in 1931. From 1933 to 1934, he also served as a professor of international law and economics at the Medford School of Law and Diplomacy in Massachusetts and as a consultant to Kendall Cotton Company in Boston. In the same year, he also served as a senior researcher at the U.S. Treasury Department. From that time until 1938, he also served as the director of the Research and Statistics Institute affiliated with the Federal Reserve Bank Board. Since July 1939, he has served as Roosevelt's administrative assistant. Currie is a member of the American Economic Association and is the author of "The Supply and Control of Money in the United States," published in 1930. (7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – U.S. President Roosevelt's representative Currie has arrived in Chongqing. Those who welcomed him at the airport included Chairman Chiang, Vice President Kong, Foreign Minister Wang, representatives from Minister of Economic Affairs Weng, reporters from China and the United States, and a Chinese representative from a German news agency. Currie is a member of the brains trust serving President Roosevelt and is an important figure. He will stay in the wartime capital for about a month and will hold talks with the Chinese side. The general public expects him to achieve important results in the economic field. The concept of the interconnected relationship between China and the United States is stronger than ever before. On the one hand, China deeply understands the reliability of effective American assistance, especially at this time. On the other hand, the prestige of China's four years of war against Japan has increased, which is also a matter of common knowledge. During Currie's stay in Chongqing, the Chinese government will treat him with the etiquette of a distinguished guest. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Sino-American Talks on New Loans Face No Difficulties</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi declared today that the loan negotiations currently being conducted by the Chinese government in Washington have not encountered any difficulties. The various rumors circulating are completely inaccurate. However, methods for a new loan are currently being drafted. It is understood that Roosevelt's special envoy Currie, who will arrive in Chongqing in the next two days, is responsible for drafting the methods for the new loan. Regarding the question of whether the United States will demand political privileges in exchange for granting the new loan, Kong Xiangxi stated that he had not heard of any such demand. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Central Daily News Editorial: Welcome Dr. Currie</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Daily News commented on Currie's visit to China on the 7th, stating that when China initiated the war, the United States and the Soviet Union were the first to recognize it as the first voice of mankind protecting freedom against aggressors. Among the American leaders, President Roosevelt had the most thorough understanding. At that time, due to different internal and external environments in the United States, President Roosevelt implemented the policies in his (isolation) speech. Today, three and a half years after China's war, the U.S. government and the general public have recognized President Roosevelt's foresight. Even the Army Secretary in the House of Representatives today, in answering questions, also acknowledged the close relationship between China's war and friendly countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Since we are determined to fight for the freedom of China and the freedom of all mankind, we of course welcome friends from friendly countries to come to China to investigate. The Chinese people's deep understanding of the noble national character of the United States and the great personality of President Roosevelt will surely be discovered by Mr. Currie anytime and anywhere during his stay in China. We request that Mr. Currie convey the respect of the entire Chinese people to President Roosevelt when he returns home. The relevant departments of our government will provide Mr. Currie with all research conveniences, and the heads of all departments will exchange opinions with Mr. Currie in a completely unreserved manner. The closeness of the relationship between China and the United States is the greatest today. Now, China and the United States have a common enemy and a common responsibility. We earnestly hope that Mr. Currie can successfully complete his mission. Mr. Currie will surely discover at any time the determination of our entire nation to fight and China's need for American sympathy and effective assistance. Mr. Currie will also surely discover everywhere that we believe the free world will achieve victory. In this free world, the United States and China are both indispensable members. (7th)</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army in Southern Henan Achieves Repeated Victories, Recaptures Eight Cities in Five Days, Recaptures Runan County Yesterday Morning, Clears Japanese North of Queshan on the Pinghan Railway Line, Both Sides are Locked in a Standoff Near Danshui</h3>
<p>Luoyang – In the recent battles in southern Henan, the Chinese army recaptured eight major and important county towns, including Wuyang, Xiping, Suiping, Zhengyang, Shangcai, Xiangcheng, Fangcheng, and Nanyang, as well as more than ten important strongholds, in just five days, showing impressive momentum. On the front line of the Pinghan Railway, there are no more Japanese soldiers north of Queshan. The Japanese soldiers on both sides of the railway can be cleared. All Chinese armies are now searching and advancing, and complete victory can be achieved. (7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Military News: The Chinese army in southern Henan is rapidly pursuing the defeated Japanese who are retreating south along the Pinghan Railway. On the morning of the 5th, they recaptured Suiping, and then defeated the Japanese army stationed in Zhumadian. On the east side of the Pinghan Railway, the Chinese army recaptured Runan on the morning of the 7th. This time, the Japanese army attacked north from Xinyang, originally hoping for a quick victory, but the result was a major defeat. The Chinese army is actively comforting the people in the disaster area. On the morning of the 3rd, the Chinese army launched attacks on various Japanese strongholds in Yichang West Jinjiadabao and Maogoudongwan, engaging in fierce battles until the morning of the 4th. During the attack on Maogoudongwan, over 200 Japanese soldiers were killed, and more than 3 light machine guns, over 100 rifles, and many other military supplies were seized. The Japanese army that invaded Taihe once broke into the city walls on the 5th and continued to invade southwest on the 6th. After being severely attacked by the Chinese army, the Japanese could not withstand it and collapsed and retreated. On the morning of the 7th, the Chinese army completely recaptured the city walls of Taihe. More than 1,170 Japanese bodies were left behind. The Chinese army seized 4 artillery pieces, 12 light and heavy machine guns, 354 rifles, and many other military supplies. Also, the Japanese army that invaded Jieshou on the evening of the 5th was defeated by the Chinese army on the morning of the 7th, with over 300 Japanese soldiers killed. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled northeast. On the morning of the 4th, over 1,000 Japanese soldiers who invaded Pinghu were severely attacked and defeated by the Chinese army. There are no more Japanese soldiers in Longgang and Pinghu. Also, the Japanese army that invaded Henggang was counterattacked by the Chinese army. On the afternoon of the 5th, the Japanese soldiers fled east. The Chinese army is currently pursuing and annihilating them. (7th)</p>
<p>Huiyang – The Japanese army that forcibly landed at Aotou on the 4th arrived at Danshui and launched an attack on the morning of the 5th, but were bravely blocked by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. The entire Japanese army retreated back to Danshui and is still locked in a standoff with the Chinese army near Danshui. (7th)</p>
<p>Luoyang – After the Chinese army captured Xiping, it actively advanced south. By the evening of the 3rd, it had approached the outskirts of Suiping. After a fierce attack by the Chinese army, the Japanese army could not withstand it and continued to retreat to Queshan on the morning of the 5th. Suiping was recaptured by the Chinese army, and the county government will be able to move into the city to work and comfort the people. (6th)</p>
<p>Luoyang – In Jinan, the Japanese army has been plotting trouble again recently. In the area of Lanba Zhen, Tianshui Cen (west of Jincheng), the Japanese army is engaged in fierce battles north of Hua Zhunping. It is reported that the Japanese army in the area of Hedi Daitaimiao, east of Wenxi, has recently increased by 1,500 to 600 troops. On the morning of the 4th, under the cover of artillery fire, they launched an attack on the area of Geta and Dayugou (southeast of Wenxi). After fighting until noon, Dayugou was captured, but the Chinese army launched a counterattack and recaptured it. The battle situation was extremely fierce. The Chinese army is currently driving out the invading Japanese army. (6th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman reported on the progress of the battles in southern Henan at a press conference this afternoon, stating that the Japanese army advanced north from Xinyang on the 24th of last month and reached the line of Suiping, Wuyang, and Fangcheng on the 31st. As the advance went deep, the rear transportation line became too long, and the Chinese army attacked everywhere on both sides, so the Japanese army's offensive was frustrated. On the 1st of this month, the Chinese army on the front line began a counterattack, echoing the Chinese army behind the Japanese army. The Japanese army was forced to abandon Wuyang, Fangcheng, and other places. The Wuyang unit retreated along the original road to Songping, while the Fangcheng unit detoured around Daxingji, east of Nanyang, and retreated to Biyang. The Chinese army continued to pursue after recapturing Wuyang and Fangcheng on the 2nd. In summary, the Japanese army has deployed as many as 100,000 troops in the past two weeks, suffering considerable casualties. The Chinese side has also suffered significant losses. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Fancheng – Since the 2nd, a unit of the Japanese army in southern Henan has launched an invasion of Eryang in two routes. The central route was blocked by the Chinese army and has not succeeded so far. The right route moved towards An, and the left route invaded Sheqi, carrying out east-west flanking attacks on Nanyang, and using aircraft to assist in the battle, carrying out low-altitude indiscriminate bombing. The battles in the suburbs have been fierce beyond precedent in the past three days. At the same time, local militias are assisting the national army in the battle. Among them, one militia regiment fought bravely under the strong artillery fire of the Japanese army, and eventually the entire regiment was martyred, resulting in an exceptionally tragic battle. Although the Japanese army invaded the vicinity of the city suburbs on the evening of the 4th, their casualties were extremely high. At midnight on the 3rd, a certain Chinese deputy commander launched a fierce night attack according to the original plan, defeating the Japanese army in one fell swoop. The Japanese army fled southeast. They are now searching for the remaining Japanese soldiers, comforting the refugees, and pursuing them. (7th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – News received here today stated that since Danshui, 50 kilometers northeast of Hong Kong, was occupied by the Japanese army on Tuesday, a large amount of tungsten sand and tung oil there has fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Danshui is an important town on the coast of South China and a base for the Chinese Fourth Military Region, and is connected to Shaoguan, the wartime capital of Guangdong Province, by a highway. After the Japanese army landed in several places in Daya Bay, Danshui was declared lost. Another piece of news said that in addition to seizing tungsten sand and tung oil being shipped to Britain, the Japanese army also intercepted a large amount of gasoline and other military supplies. Since the highways connecting the unlost areas of the South China coast were cut off by the Japanese army, all the free territory of Guangdong is now isolated. The loss of import and export goods in Guangdong Province is estimated to be worth several million yuan. (International, 7th)</p>
<p>German Side Denies Rumors</p>
<p>Special Report from this city: The responsible German party in this city issued the following statement today: The report by a certain news agency in Hong Kong on the 4th of this month, which stated that German military experts were training Japanese troops in Guangzhou and Hainan Island to engage in "blitzkrieg tactics," has previously been declared inaccurate. This rumor has no basis in fact. (Haitong News Agency)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Exploiting Northwest Oil Fields</h3>
<p>Since machines operate, soaring into the sky and diving into the ocean, there is a demand for materials to power machines that are light in mass but produce strong power. Thus, there has been a progression from water to heavy oil, to light oil, and then the refining and classification of light oils to meet the needs of various machines. Therefore, no matter how strong mechanized units may be, able to conquer cities and forts like sweeping away dead leaves and braving fire and danger with ease, they ultimately cannot do without oil. For this reason, the first thing airplanes want to bomb are oil storage tanks; the thing the United States wants to ban from export is aviation fuel; the reason the Germans stationed troops in Romania is because it has oil-producing areas; the reason the Japanese recklessly advanced south, seeming not to mind taking a desperate gamble, is precisely to secure a supply of gasoline and other petroleum products. Oil has become something the whole world depends on, something everyone strives for, even to the point of determining the success or failure of wars. Even in the past in peacetime and in the future after the war, the revival of all industries and the operation of transportation will depend on the abundance or scarcity of oil reserves. Recently, there has been news that China has invested 70 million yuan, plus 3 million U.S. dollars, to purchase machinery and develop oil mines in a certain area of Gansu Province. It will be operated by the state, with Weng Wenhao as chairman of the board, to refine various grades of gasoline to meet domestic needs. The matter is in the planning stages and has not yet been realized. However, given the importance of oil at present and the inconvenience of gasoline supply in the interior, self-production and self-sufficiency to solve this difficult problem is something we regret only began too late, so why worry that it will not become a reality?</p>
<p>The Northwest has many oil mines, which were discovered early in ancient times. In the past, there was also discussion about exploiting them, but precisely because of a lack of talent and funds, economic development and investment have mostly focused on the commercially prosperous areas along the rivers and coasts. Great sources of profit have been buried for a long time, not valued by the world. Since the war shifted west and the political axis moved inland, talent has gathered, creating opportunities for developing the Southwest and Northwest. As far as we can imagine at present, the postwar status of Wuhan, the central hub of the Yangtze River, Shanghai in the lower reaches, and Tianjin on the Baihe River will not be as important as before the war, and transportation between the Northwest and Southeast will not be as difficult as before. Therefore, those in Shanghai who are currently busy pursuing profit in isolated islands, thinking that it is the most convenient and secure place for investment, should realize that their vision is no different from that of a frog at the bottom of a well.</p>
<p>The success of a career must involve a spirit of pioneering wilderness and persevering through hardship. Great entrepreneurs all have far-sighted visions, so they can achieve extraordinary accomplishments that surpass the past and exceed the present. China's business community often has narrow vision, hoarding wealth like life, and being eager for short-term gains, so their achievements are also small. Even if there have been occasional attempts in the past, they often failed, so they are even more disheartened by great enterprises and dare not consult them. In fact, if an arrow does not hit the target, it is not the fault of the bow and arrow, but the incompetence of the archer, and it is not impossible to hit the target at first. I still remember in the Guangxu era, when industry was revitalized, the Sanxin Cotton Mill, which was the first to be established, was burned down, and the cause of its carelessness was that the rotating shaft was not oiled, resulting in ignition. Today's workers consider oiling the shaft to be insignificant, but at that time, this kind of common sense and experience was still lacking. At the same time, Hongyuan Cotton Mill in Pudong, which was run by a certain foreign merchant, was asked how business was going? Pointing to the workers, he said that it would have to wait until their grandchildren's hands. What does this mean? It means that without skilled workers, the products are not refined, the output is not high, so it is difficult to make a profit, and skilled workers must be cultivated over a considerable period of time. From this, we can see that the many failures of Chinese industry are precisely because there is no talent, or the wrong talent is used, or the talent is not what it excels at; or they only know a little, or they only know the general outline, so they have little achievement, which makes those who are determined to revitalize the industry discouraged and investors disheartened. Now, after decades of management, we should be able to correct the previous shortcomings. In the current situation, China still has no great industrialists, and most of the industry is still in the hands of foreigners, which is very painful. However, industrial talent is no longer what it used to be. Recently, various projects in the Southwest have been carried out with less reliance on foreign experts. Most of them are self-reliant, and their achievements are no weaker than others. And now, the exploitation of Northwest oil fields is being managed by geologist Weng Wenhao, using his talent well; and with American investment, the procurement of machinery, etc., there is no need to worry about it being outdated. The oil refining industry is a brand-new enterprise in China, and the demand for oil is booming, so profit is within easy reach. Although it is now state-run, the floating capital in Shanghai is suffering from being flooded with money. Such a great opportunity for profit is a rare opportunity to encourage Chinese investment. The business community in Shanghai, as well as wealthy merchants and big buyers, instead of storing their vast funds idle in the vaults of the money industry; or using them to hoard and speculate, disrupt the market, and harm people's livelihood, why not pool their resources, gather talent, and go to the Northwest to develop? The land is vast and sparsely populated, and the resources are untapped. If they are used well, the future is limitless. If they cling to the current prosperity and forget the great plan of revitalizing industry and building the country, they will inevitably follow in the footsteps of Zu Ti, only to deeply regret missing the opportunity. What advantages and disadvantages need to be determined by divination!</p>
<h3>Franco-Thai Peace Talks Hold First Meeting Yesterday, Japanese Representative Matsuoka Delivers Opening Remarks, Date of Second Meeting Not Announced</h3>

<p>Tokyo – The Franco-Thai peace talks under Japanese guidance were held at the official residence of Prime Minister Konoe at 4:30 this afternoon. Foreign Minister Matsuoka, in his capacity as mediator, delivered a brief opening speech, saying that he wished to see the Thai and French delegations demonstrate full understanding and sincere cooperation, just as they did at the ceasefire conference in Saigon in late January. He deeply believed that the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was not only Japanese policy, but also a historical necessity. Matsuoka also said that Japan's decision to act as mediator was out of concern for the interests of all of East Asia, and it was inappropriate to allow border disputes to occur between Thailand and Vietnam. The Japanese government is now prepared to work with a firm and responsible attitude to promote the resolution of this dispute. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii met with foreign visitors this morning, he was asked about Japan's attitude towards the Thai-French peace conference. Ishii replied that Japan is now making every effort to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Since Japan has taken on the role of mediator, it will maintain a fair attitude. Both the Vietnamese and French delegations have arrived in Tokyo, so the peace conference will open at the Prime Minister's official residence this afternoon. We hope that this conference will achieve good results. When asked who will chair the conference, Ishii replied that Foreign Minister Matsuoka will chair the opening ceremony, but future meetings will be chaired by Matsuoka's deputy. Someone also asked whether the meeting would discuss future cooperation between Thailand, Vietnam, and Japan in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Ishii replied that this matter had not yet been discussed. Ishii also said that when the conference is in progress, the Franco-Japanese Economic Conference will be temporarily suspended.

<p>Hanoi – Telegraph and telephone communications between Thailand and Vietnam have been restored. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The local newspapers here emphasized the importance of the Thai-Vietnamese negotiations held at the Prime Minister's official residence this morning. The Hochi Shimbun stated that all parties attach great importance to this conference. Japan is using this conference to reiterate its leadership position in East Asia, and the Thai and Vietnamese sides have the opportunity to strengthen relations between Asian nations. On this point, we cannot but admire the fair attitude of both Thailand and Vietnam in accepting Japan's mediation, so as to permanently resolve the long-standing border disputes between Thailand and Vietnam, thereby opening up the path to establishing the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, we hope that this peace conference will achieve results that are satisfactory to both parties, so that Thailand and Vietnam can work together to complete the common mission of Asian nations in building the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that Japan is making every effort to resolve the Thai-Vietnamese border disputes as soon as possible, even while dealing with the China Incident, because from the perspective of stabilizing the Asian situation and the coexistence and co-prosperity of Asian nations, the Thai-Vietnamese disputes should not exist in East Asia. Therefore, Japan earnestly hopes that it will be peacefully resolved. Therefore, Japan is determined to eliminate all obstacles to the establishment of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. The immediate resolution of the Thai-Vietnamese border disputes will not only open up the road to the establishment of the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, but will also directly benefit Thailand and Vietnam, and give a lesson to the Dutch East Indies, which does not want to keep pace with Asian countries in establishing the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.

<h3>Pacific Crisis Intensifies - US-Australia Understanding to Block Japan's Southern Advance - American Newspapers Highly Praise China's Warfighting Strength - East Asia's New Order Will Ultimately Become a Delusion</h3>
<p>Moscow - The "Red Star" newspaper recently commented, "Military preparations in the southwestern Pacific are now further expanding. According to the "New York Times," the United States has reached an understanding with Australia and New Zealand, permitting the US to use their bases in the event of a US-Japan war. The report further stated that after these bases are provided to the US, the US fleet can directly reach Singapore, preventing Japan's southern advance. US Admiral Stirling advocated the establishment of a joint Anglo-American staff in the Far East. Japan's demand that the Netherlands join the 'East Asia New Order' in India has been strongly rejected by the Dutch ambassador to Japan. Foreign newspapers believe that this point demonstrates the determination of the United States and Britain to defend the Dutch East Indies oil fields."</p>
<p>Regarding the tense situation in the Far East, the "New York Herald Tribune" stated, "China has now tied down millions of Japanese troops, and Britain and the Netherlands are also determined to let Japan 'taste the flavor of modern warfare.' If Japan drags us into war, our Pacific battleships will surely reduce Japan to a third-rate country."</p>
<p>"Red Star" continued, "On January 30, the Japanese government and military commanders held a meeting. Subsequently, key members of the Japanese General Staff convened another meeting. Army Minister Tojo requested at the meeting to reorganize the army and its training methods in order to cope with the tense international situation. Foreign newspapers generally believe that Japan's military plans have gone beyond the preparation stage. This point has been proven by the concentration of Japanese army and air forces in various areas of South China, and the patrolling of the Japanese navy near Vietnam." (TASS dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington - The "Washington Star" commented yesterday, "Japan's war to conquer China has not succeeded after four years of effort, and Japan's energy has been continuously depleted. Until now, the unfortunate war has become a last-ditch effort. Japan's dream of advancing south seems destined to end in illusion. Therefore, China's continued fighting can prevent Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States from becoming victims of Japan's 'New Order.'"

<h3>Hu Shih Speaks in the United States - China's Strength Remains as Strong as Ever - Japan's Economy is Weakening</h3>
<p>New York - Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Hu Shih, delivered a speech last night, stating that after forty-three months of war, "China remains as resolute and strong as ever, while Japan is gradually weakening." Hu Shih said, "The entire international situation has clearly become favorable to China." The famous Chinese scholar also said that the New Fourth Army incident was purely a matter of enforcing military discipline. He stated that since the beginning of the war, the number of Japanese soldiers killed and permanently disabled is about one million, and the economic position of the Japanese has weakened. However, "a revolution is unlikely to occur in Japan, just as a revolution is unlikely to occur in Germany." He said, "The reason is that the people of both countries are well-trained and easily subdued." (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Gauss to be Envoy to China, Winant to be Envoy to England, Johnson Appointed Minister to Australia - Roosevelt Asks Senate for Approval</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt has designated former US Consul General in Shanghai, currently US Minister to Australia, Gauss, as Ambassador to China, while Johnson will be transferred to Minister to Australia. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt this morning asked the Senate to approve the appointment of Winant as Ambassador to England and Gauss as Ambassador to China. Winant served as Chairman of the Investigative Committee on the American Textile Industry Strike in 1934 and has many years of research on labor issues. In the decisive year, he was a co-worker in the International Labor Bureau and returned to the United States within a few months to assist President Roosevelt in handling new measures and implementing social security procedures. In 1936, he was appointed Supervisor of the International Labor Bureau. After the collapse of France, Chiang moved the International Labor Bureau office to McGill University in Montreal. President Roosevelt also sent the appointment of former Ambassador to Poland Biddle as Ambassador to Belgium and concurrently Minister to Norway and the Netherlands (the governments of these three countries are temporarily located in London) to the Senate for approval. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington - Presidential Secretary O'Reilly said that Johnson's appointment as Minister to Australia, although seemingly a demotion in title, is actually a reward. O'Reilly pointed out that Johnson had endured hardships in China. Whenever the Chinese government decided to relocate the capital, Johnson always decided to move with it. During the undeclared war between China and Japan, Johnson faced countless crises. O'Reilly also said that President Roosevelt wanted to transfer him to "a tranquil and peaceful place where he could enjoy family happiness" as a reward. He also said that Gauss's mission to China is in recognition of his hard work as Consul General in Shanghai when American expatriates felt threatened at the beginning of the Shanghai Incident. Winant was previously the Republican Governor of New Hampshire and is well-loved by the British Liberal Party, labor groups, and leaders. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>New York - Today's "New York Herald" reports that the mission of the new US Ambassador to England, Winant, will exceed the routine duties of an ordinary ambassador, stating that it is similar to the dispatch of Lord Halifax to the United States, outside of diplomatic conventions.

<h3>US Lend-Lease Bill - Restricts Presidential Prerogatives - House Passes Important Clauses - Opposition Amendments Rejected</h3>
<p>Washington - The House of Representatives yesterday added a clause to the Lend-Lease Bill, stipulating that Congress may at any time, by a majority vote of both houses, suspend the President's power to execute the bill. This proposal passed by a majority vote, with 148 in favor and 141 against. All other previously proposed amendments failed. The House also rejected by a vote of 136 to 93 an amendment proposed by California Democratic Congressman Voorhis, which would have limited the lend-lease provisions to June 30, 1942. The fierce debate that began yesterday ended with a vote. The first vote was 109 to 78 to reject an amendment prohibiting the transfer or sale of military supplies, which argued that all military supplies not certified by the leaders of the Army and Navy as irrelevant to US national defense should be prohibited from transfer or sale. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington - The US House of Representatives yesterday, by a vote of 200 to 145, overturned the first resolution to change the original text of the Lend-Lease Bill. The opposition proposed limiting aid to Britain to $20 billion and hoped to replace the Lend-Lease Bill with this proposal, but it was ultimately rejected by a majority vote. The House then tentatively adopted a proposal to place a five-year limit on the President's authority to enter into contracts under this bill. This proposal was initiated by Democratic members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and aims to address the opposition's protests, which believe that under this bill, the President will have the power to enter into contracts that could bind Congress for ten years before July 1943. However, the aforementioned five-year limit does not apply to the period of payment for rubber, minerals, etc., that foreign governments have promised to pay to the United States in exchange for US material assistance. The House also voted 111 to 74 to reject a proposal to include a clause in the bill warning the President not to escort US ships to belligerent ports, but temporarily agreed to adopt a clause stating that the provisions of this bill should not be construed as authorizing US warships to escort.

<h3>Lindbergh Speaks Again - Exposing Timid Psychology</h3>
<p>Washington - Colonel Charles Lindbergh, a famous American aviator and a stalwart isolationist, recently attended the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to explain his views on the "Military Equipment Lend-Lease Bill." He stated that if the United States is invaded in the future, he believes that those who send American troops abroad should be held responsible. It is indeed necessary to strengthen American military equipment and modernize it, but if it is believed that our country's security completely depends on the victory of Britain, I really cannot agree, because I believe that Britain has very little certainty of winning. As far as the US Air Force is concerned, it will take several years before it can be on par with the German Air Force. Even if the British Air Force receives American assistance, it will not be able to reach a balance with the German Air Force. If our country actively assists Britain materially, it will be responsible for prolonging the European war. The impact of this will not only fail to influence the war situation but will only lead to the decline of democracy. Moreover, our country's air force strength is already weak and should not be further weakened due to providing aid to third countries. Otherwise, it would be tantamount to opening the door to aggression. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Roman Newspapers Publish Articles - Continuing to Threaten the US</h3>
<p>Rome - The Bologna newspaper today published a commentary on its front page, warning the United States that if the United States violates neutrality, Japan will be forced to side with the Axis powers and participate in the current war. The newspaper stated that Britain is busy with matters in Europe and Africa and will not be able to assist the United States in Asia. Therefore, if Japan participates in the war, it will use its entire warfighting force against the United States. American politicians should also note that if the United States violates neutrality and causes Japan to participate in the war, the Saxon front along the Atlantic Ocean will inevitably be weakened. Italian Prime Minister's mouthpiece Gaeda also published a commentary in the Italian Daily, stating, "If the United States approves the Aid to Democratic Nations Act, it will be a blatant violation of neutrality and therefore bear all possible moral or material consequences."

<h3>Braving Great Winds and Sand - British Forces Capture Benghazi - Site of Italian Army Headquarters - British Forces on the East African Front Advance Straight to Keren</h3>
<p>London - This morning, it was officially announced that British forces have captured Benghazi, General Graziani's last stronghold and the most important base of the Italian army in Cyrenaica. Details of the attack are not yet known, but according to military sources here, a violent sandstorm is currently occurring in the Benghazi area. The area has a population of 35,000, including a large number of Maltese, Greek, Italian, and Jewish people. The city is quite clean and has a beautifully built market, several mosques, and synagogues. Benghazi is the capital of Cyrenaica and the Italian army's naval and air base. The headquarters of General Graziani was originally located there. The British army has already occupied it, in fact it amounts to encompassing all of Cyrenaica. A responsible commentator today said that in order to capture the area, the British army advanced more than 150 miles in a week. This kind of achievement is rare, and the effectiveness of naval and air force assistance is also unexpected. The commentator also mentioned the Eritrean aspect, saying that the British army is now aiming at Keren as its target of attack. The occupation of this place has great value, but it would be an exaggeration to call it a decisive factor. Keren is located on the railway line, has an air harbor, and controls strong positions. It is not easy for the British army to capture this place, because the roads in the area south of Barentu are rugged, and the resistance of the Italian army is strong, so the advance of the British army will be delayed. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London - According to the latest news from the Eritrean front received here, British forces, after two fierce advances, have now advanced straight to Keren. The Italian army is currently attempting to resist stubbornly in that place, but in recent hours, British artillery has arrived at the foothills and bombarded it fiercely. The Italian army in the area east of Barentu is often harassed by the British, and the number of those who can reach the highway from Asmara to Agordat in order to escape quickly will be less than half of the original number. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>London - Although today's Italian army communique did not admit the loss of Benghazi, it said that there had been fierce fighting in the southern part of the area. In East Africa, the fighting is now taking place in Keren. There is nothing important to report on the Greek front. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>The Mediterranean War Situation Suddenly Changes</p>
<p>Benghazi - The occupation of Benghazi will be of great benefit to the British navy in its operations in the Mediterranean, because the landing facilities for troops and military supplies in that area are very perfect. In addition, there is a factory in that area that can be used for small-scale repairs, but it is not known how it is now after being heavily bombed by the British air force after the war. Also, in the northern part of the harbor's inner breakwater, there is a new port with an area of 370,000 square yards, which can be used in any climate and can accommodate large cruisers.

<p>British Commander Inspects Kenya</p>
<p>Nairobi - Field Marshal Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, recently made a sudden visit to Kenya for a short inspection. Wavell arrived by plane and attended a reception banquet held by the government here. (Reuters dispatch, 7th) London Reuters' war correspondent sent a delayed telegram from Libya saying that recently, reporters accompanying the army have been treated favorably by Italian farmers. If this represents the feelings of the 20,000 Italians colonizing Libya towards the British, there is also an important reason why Mussolini's African Empire is gradually breaking down, that is, these Italians are not enthusiastic about Mussolini's war at all. When the reporter was traveling with the army, he stopped in a small Italian village west of Berteidro Vanni and asked for lodging. At least a dozen Italians competed to invite the reporter into the room to sit down and offered coffee and cigarettes. On the wooden poles beside each house hung a square of white cloth. These Italians would wave this cloth to show their obedience when British troops passed by in a steady stream. When the Italian army retreated, they did not care about their lives, so after the British army arrived, these Italians had no animosity and even showed signs of comfort. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Indian Troops are Brave and Invincible</p>
<p>New Delhi - Here, we have learned of the widespread sentiment of the Indian army's brave fighting in Eritrea, and learned that the Indian army units from the Jhelum, Gujrat, Rawalpindi districts, and the Frontier Force of India, captured Barentu in one battle. Before the town was captured, an Indian brigade had fought in a narrow valley for five days, and another Indian brigade had fought for ten days along the road from Agordat to Barentu. The Indian army has experience in mountain warfare, so it won in the mountain warfare around Barentu, which is similar to the northwest frontier of India. Bayonet fighting forced the enemy to withdraw from the mountain positions and repelled numerous enemy counterattacks. The Indian army is now joining forces with friendly forces to advance from Agordat towards Keren. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Attempts to Establish a Puppet Regime in Bulgaria - Conspiring to Promote a Ceasefire Between Greece and Italy - Turkey Declares its Position Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>London - London diplomatic sources said today that Germany plans to establish a puppet regime in Sofia, as a prelude to trying to force Greece and Italy to make peace. Bulgaria's independence is still very dangerous. The dismissed Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Bagrianov and former Prime Minister Tsankov will unite to form a strong opposition party. Bagrianov's followers are mostly farmers, and Tsankov's followers are mostly officers. Diplomats believe that both are powerful traitors. Observers believe that if Germany gains control of Bulgaria, Hitler will immediately come forward to mediate the Greek-Italian war. The conditions he proposes will be very generous to Greece, probably ceding land to Greece, and during the continuation of the war, the Italian army will not be able to cross a certain boundary of Albania. Diplomats believe that if Greece admits that it cannot drive the British army out of Crete, Germany will also listen to it, but will require the British army to withdraw from the Greek mainland immediately. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Italian Forces in the Albanian Sector - Counterattack Suffers Crushing Defeat - Greek Forces Bomb Valona</h3>
<p>Athens - Athens Radio said that yesterday the Italian army launched a fierce counterattack on the central front, resulting in a crushing defeat. The Italian army deployed a large army and a large number of tanks and armored vehicles, attempting to break through the Greek army's positions, but was defeated and retreated to its base positions. The Italian army suffered heavy losses of soldiers and equipment in this battle. Several of its tanks and four armored vehicles were destroyed. The Greek army has now firmly occupied new positions. Yesterday, the fighting in all war zones on the Albanian front was satisfactory. The Greek army on a certain ridge outside Krisoula is currently consolidating its occupied positions and deploying new positions, expecting that the weather will improve and the fighting will become more intense. The Greek artillery in the northern sector is active, but the Greek army's advance is hindered by the atmosphere. The Greek army in the coastal area has made slight progress. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Athens - Today's war report stated that Tepeleni in Albania became a hell of fire last night. The victorious Greek army, advancing rapidly on the flank of the Italian army, completely destroyed its resistance. When the Greek army crushed the Italian army's desperate counterattack in the mountains north of Krisoula, the Greek army's new offensive followed immediately. In the victorious advance, the Greek army captured several important positions in the Vjosë River basin and put new pressure on Tepeleni. The Italian army launched a fierce attack with tanks and armored vehicles, intending to lift Tepeleni out of the Greek army's pressure in one fell swoop, but the result made the city even more dangerous. According to the war report, the Italian defense forces in Valona on the Adriatic coast were heavily bombarded by Greek artillery yesterday. (International dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>London - It was announced here last night that Dr. Dirk Jan de Geer, the former Prime Minister of the Netherlands, has abandoned his diplomatic mission, entered into a special agreement with German officials, and secretly entered German-occupied Holland. He is accused of being the first high-ranking figure from the Allied nations to defect since the start of the war. The Dutch government-in-exile in London expressed "deep indignation," condemning de Geer as "disloyal and harmful to national interests," and declared that the Dutch government and the Dutch people under its rule will fight alongside the Allied nations "until Germany's final defeat."

Stimson also stated that strikes have had minimal impact on the progress of army construction projects and that "the scope and duration of the strikes have been unexpectedly small." Stimson further said that the acceleration of warplane production is largely due to the efforts of Production Management Office Deputy Supervisor Hillman. Stimson emphasized that aircraft factory equipment has been greatly improved, and production is certain to increase greatly soon. (International News, 7th)</p>
<h3>New Screw Connection Method, Ford's New Invention Aids Aircraft Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Detroit - Ford is now experimenting in his factory with a revolutionary new screw connection method that can speed up aircraft production by half. This move brings Ford closer to realizing his boast last year of manufacturing 1,000 aircraft per day. Experts in the defense manufacturing industry told United Press reporters that they were very surprised after visiting Ford's new invention. It has been found that a four-engine bomber has 450,000 screws, three-quarters of which require manual work. According to Ford's new method, half of the manual work can be saved.

<h3>British General Reports Air Force Battle Achievements</h3>
<p>London - British Air Force General Quirk broadcasted last night, stating that Britain must win in air combat as a prelude to great victory. The recent quiet in aerial activity shows that the German Air Force is encountering difficulties. We have had a good winter. In the past two months, we have destroyed a total of 480 enemy aircraft. The victory-to-loss ratio for British aircraft in December and January was three to one. In the past two months, 40 enemy aircraft have been shot down near Malta, most of which were German Stuka dive bombers that they have greatly boasted. The British only lost two aircraft. This is indeed a great start. Since last June, the British Air Force in the Middle East has shot down over 350 Italian aircraft in the air and destroyed a similar number of Italian aircraft on the ground. Also, since June, in addition to destroying enemy aircraft at sea, the British have shot down 140 enemy night bombers, most of which were shot down by British night artillery. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Declares It Will Not Allow French Fleet to Transfer to Axis Nations, Darlan Takes Concessions to Paris, May Give Laval the Position of Premier</h3>
<p>London - The German official news agency's Paris dispatch states that Admiral Darlan, the Vichy government's naval chief, who arrived in Paris last night, met with French Ambassador Fernand de Brinon once. Darlan will return to Vichy tomorrow. According to Swiss radio, before Darlan was about to leave, the French cabinet suddenly convened a meeting. It is believed that Vichy's policies and proposals were decided on Wednesday after Darlan reported to the cabinet the results of his first trip to Paris. No communiqué was released after yesterday's cabinet meeting. Pétain met with U.S. Ambassador Leahy yesterday after the cabinet meeting. Some observers attach great importance to this meeting, due to rumors that there are still those in the Vichy cabinet who insist on opposing Laval's reinstatement. According to a Swiss Lausanne Daily reporter in Vichy, Pétain knows that most French people do not trust Laval and consider him Hitler's regional leader in France. Although there is still no definite news about the German-French negotiations, Swiss newspapers expect the crisis to be resolved soon. The German official news agency also stated that Pétain may announce his decision to the nation via radio this weekend. The Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent commented on Pétain's meeting with the U.S. Ambassador, saying that Ambassador Leahy's actions were based on special instructions from President Roosevelt. The two met for a long time, and it is said that Leahy reiterated his warning in strong terms, saying that the United States attaches great importance to the fate of the French fleet and the maintenance of its integrity, and urged Pétain to firmly resist Laval's and other Nazis' demands. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London - According to the London Daily Express, U.S. Ambassador to Vichy, Admiral Leahy, solemnly declared during a meeting with French Premier Marshal Pétain yesterday that the United States cannot sit idly by as the French fleet is handed over to the Axis powers. The report states that Germany recently made a request to the Vichy government, specifying that the French fleet be handed over to Germany and requesting the use of French bases. This matter has been confirmed. It is also said that after Leahy presented the U.S. position on the French fleet, it is not known how Pétain responded to Leahy's warning. (International News Service, 7th)</p>
<p>Vichy - French sources predicted last night that after Admiral Darlan's re-visit to Paris within five days, the German-French crisis will be finally resolved this weekend. Darlan has already been granted the position of premier by Marshal Pétain. Less than half an hour after Admiral Darlan received Marshal Pétain's final instructions, U.S. Ambassador to France Leahy visited Pétain. It is subsequently claimed that Admiral Darlan is making a trip from Vichy to Paris, preparing to discuss Marshal Pétain's response to German demands with Laval. It is known from reliable sources here that Marshal Pétain gave the position of premier to Darlan as a compromise for appointing Laval as premier. It is expected that if this is implemented, Laval will serve as deputy premier. It is said that Laval has requested that he be appointed premier and allowed to choose a completely new cabinet. Laval further stated that he would only be responsible to the National Advisory Council. It is rumored that Marshal Pétain is willing to give up his government positions, remaining only as the Head of State of France, and unwilling to comply with Laval's "demands." (International News, 7th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Naval Minister Admiral Darlan left Vichy for Paris yesterday, carrying Premier Pétain's most lenient conditions, inviting Laval to join the cabinet as Deputy Head of State. Admiral Darlan planned to dine with German authorities in Paris last night and will meet with Laval today. Although the opinions between Paris and Vichy are still not close, the door to negotiations is still open. It is heard that Darlan will return to Vichy tonight or tomorrow so that the cabinet can meet tomorrow to make a final decision. After the crisis passes, Premier Pétain will broadcast to the nation to explain the reasons for Laval's return and the sudden change in policy. This policy may result in Premier Pétain giving up part of his government leadership power. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>European War Commentary (30) (3)</p>
<h3>Secrets of the U.S. Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Let's first talk about the preparations the United States made for the Pan-American Conference. In early December 1938, the U.S. delegation to the Pan-American Conference, led by Secretary of State Cordell Hull, went to Lima, the capital of Peru, to attend the conference. The purpose was to establish a common front in North and South America.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Lima, Hull contacted the representatives of the 19 countries separately. The difficult ones were the representatives of Brazil and Colombia, who both advocated organizing a Western Hemisphere International Federation. Others, such as Uruguay, were indecisive, Argentina leaned toward Britain, and isolationism was particularly strong, making it the most difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>The Argentine delegation was led by the country's Foreign Minister, José María Cantilo, a cunning and impatient man. Upon arriving at the conference, he advocated that the conference should be strictly limited to discussing pan-American affairs and supported issuing a simple declaration of solidarity without any conditions. He also announced that due to health reasons, he planned to go to a lakeside resort in Chile for rest immediately, so he requested the conference to make a decision quickly. However, Hull was unwilling to act hastily, so Cantilo quietly left, leaving the country's delegation without a leader.</p>
<p>The newspapers were filled with discussions about Cantilo's departure, saying it was the work of German secret agents. However, Cantilo was not completely isolated from the situation at the conference and finally proposed a plan, sending it by telegram to the country's delegation for Hull to see. Hull saw that its content was in line with his own ideas and presented it to the representatives of various countries, and it was finally passed unanimously by the conference. This is the so-called "Declaration of Lima," whose far-reaching significance lies in having the Monroe Doctrine, which the United States had created alone, jointly guaranteed by the countries of North and South America. This was Hull's great victory.</p>
<p>After the Munich Conference, President Roosevelt decided to adopt an active policy toward both the Western Hemisphere and Europe, and the achievements of the Lima Conference can be said to be the product of this decision. However, the situation in Europe was deteriorating daily, and he had to adopt various peaceful offensives toward Hitler.</p>
<p>That winter, Britain and France rearmed as if drunk and in a dream, and the situation became more serious month by month. British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, took office in January 1939, met with the President, and stated that reconciliation in Europe was hopeless. At the same time, it was rumored that Germany had asked Belgium to remain neutral when German troops attacked the Netherlands. For a time, rumors spread like frightened birds, as if Germany was about to launch a blitzkrieg against the Netherlands immediately. This terror quickly subsided, but it recurred in February. In the midst of this up-and-down war terror, the President had a precise prediction with Secretary of the Navy Edison.</p>
<p>"Chirley" (Edison's nickname), the President said, "Before we get through this summer, we're bound to see the world plunged into another catastrophe. We've done everything we can to prevent war, but we're still holding on to a small hope."</p>
<p>"When do you think it will happen?" Edison asked.</p>
<p>"According to my guess, it won't escape the end of June or the beginning of July," the President replied.</p>
<p>Some people with good intentions understood President's Roosevelt's difficulties caused by pushing the peace offensive, but some people still thought he was eager for war. Some senators did not understand the truth and went to the White House in groups to ask the President what was going on. The President vividly described the dark situation in Europe, saying that war was imminent and would directly affect the safety of the United States.</p>
<p>The President continued to list the various small countries in Europe, such as Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Scandinavian Peninsula countries, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the northern Balkan Peninsula countries, all of which were in danger of being dragged into the whirlpool of war. Finally, he turned the conversation to the Western Hemisphere, saying that the colonies of Britain, France, and the Netherlands were scattered all over the world, and if these territories fell into the hands of Germany, the disasters of war would be endless. In short, the struggle between the two different economic groups of the "rich" and the "have-nots" was about to trigger a world revolution. Although the United States was separated by vast oceans, it would inevitably be regarded as a "rich" country and coveted by others, "So, the Rhine region!"</p>
<p>"Do you mean that our border is on the Rhine River?" one senator asked.</p>
<p>"Not exactly. But to be honest, if the Rhine border is threatened, the rest of the world will also be threatened. Once the Rhine region falls, the scope of German activities will be unstoppable,"</p>
<p>However, the President's vision still made the senators half-doubtful, and isolationism further slandered him. The President still could not get people to understand, and the case to abolish the arms embargo was still delayed. But by March 10, the President's various predictions had finally been confirmed one by one.</p>
<p>On this day, U.S. Minister to Czechoslovakia, Karl, telegraphed to report that the Czechoslovak government had dismissed the Slovak cabinet members who had colluded with Germany to advocate Slovak independence. Two days later, news from Berlin confirmed that Hitler had instigated the Slovak people to become independent. At 3:55 a.m. on March 15, Czech President Hácha had already surrendered to Hitler in the German Chancellery. At 6:00 a.m., German troops had entered the Czech province of Bohemia. By breakfast time, the news had spread that German troops had entered the Czech capital.</p>
<p>At this time, Britain and France no longer attempted reconciliation. The U.S. ambassadors to Britain and France also reported at the same time that peace was hopeless and that war was inevitable. On March 20, Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov informed the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union that Britain had inquired with the Soviet government about the Soviet attitude if Germany attacked Romania.</p>

<h3>The Strike Tide at Xingzhong School, Both Sides Accept Mediation, Complete Employment Procedures This Afternoon, Resume Teaching at 1:00 PM as Scheduled</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) The second strike tide occurred among some teachers and staff at the private Xingzhong Elementary and Middle School on Jin Shenfu Road, Qunxian Villa. The authorities' preparations for arbitration at each level of mediation, which was on the verge of collapse, have been detailed in yesterday's newspapers. People throughout the city who are concerned about education are watching the development of yesterday's situation.

<p>According to the Dazhong News Agency, the Xingzhong Elementary and Middle School storm, the school board side, yesterday made an effort to mediate, teachers on the side said that they are welcome any form of mediation, only require that the school side can accept the agreement of the arbitration, then they can dispel the idea of resignation.</p>

<h3>Impressions of the Suzhou Art School Alumni Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 6th), the alumni art exhibition of the Suzhou Art School in the Daxin Painting Gallery, like a brocade belt, a piece of music, a poem, it held my entire sensory perception,</p>
<p>The entire exhibit, with sincere spirituality, expressed the unique styles of each artist. In my opinion, there are some that are worth special mention. First, there is Shang Jun's enlightening small oil painting landscape, like a little girl growing up in the wilderness, using her simple, natural tone to sing the youth of the earth, the beauty of life. Li Jun Zongjin's oil painting portrait, with skillful brushstrokes and colors, the composition of the painting, from the thoughtful eyes, the supporting wrists, the undulating folds of the clothes, the rhythm of the entire painting, expresses not only the portrait, not only the external form and movements, but also gives it living life, moving spirituality. Wu Jun Yisheng's sketches, although the brushstrokes are detailed, the rendering seems too exaggerated, forming an emptiness of inner form. As for the oil painting "Truth," the colors are bright and the brushstrokes are still extremely detailed. Anyone who has had spring in their own life will feel the reproduction of spring in front of him. Xu Jiuling's portraits and still lifes all have his consistent style, with quiet colors, steady techniques, and an infinite richness of vitality. Turning to Chen Jun Liusheng's landscape, using a calm tone to express the surging tide is most suitable. Hu Cuizhong's watercolor paintings are clear in color and concise in brushstrokes. The expressions of his portraits are lifelike, but it seems less mature than his landscapes. Min Jun Wanshi's colors are deep and expressive of agility. Also, several landscapes by Chen Jun and Wang Jun seem to be imitations, but they have not grasped the true essence of nature and easily fall into vulgarity and emptiness. Wang Jun Weinan's "Soul, Return Home" has profound emotion and clear and quiet colors. Yan Wenliang's landscape oil paintings are like graceful and generous noblewomen. His brushstrokes are exquisite and detailed, and the coloring is either quiet or bright. The depth of his touching is truly indescribable. There is also a pastel painting of a kitchen, with appropriate composition and beautiful and vivid colors in each tone, which everyone can appreciate without me saying more. Huang Juegui's works have another style. Just look at his "Countryside," the dreamlike colored mist and water color, is it poetry, is it painting, is it a dream, is it real, intriguing, the interest is between looming. As for Fei Chengwu's "Remnants of the Robbery," it seems necessary to mention it specially. The brushstrokes are seasoned and sincere, and the composition and subject matter make people feel fresh and new. In this song of nature, I almost forgot the tragic killings circulating in the world, almost ignored the bottomless sorrow hidden in my heart, and almost lost the memory that weighed heavily on my spirituality. After seeing "Remnants of the Robbery," and seeing Yu Yunjie's "On the Jialing River," it awakened my love for the beautiful rivers and mountains of the motherland. There are also Zhu Shijie's landscapes, with faithful and forceful colors and brushstrokes, and Li Chu's old man, with profound and incisive depiction.</p>
<p>Zai Jun Cangqi's calligraphy is vigorous and strong, starting from the age of fifteen and seventeen, truly rare. And his landscapes and animals, such as "Spring Dawn in Liutang" and "Double Dog Picture," are beautiful and elegant. Wu Chuiying's landscapes are also elegant and beautiful, and similar to Dai Jun's, they seem to come from the same family. Chen Yuancang's figures and landscapes use thick brushstrokes and have a magnificent aura. Wu Qi's flowers are beautiful and intelligent, exceptionally delicate. Jiang Daixi, Chen Yanfan, and Jiang Shaoji all excel in delicacy, while Xun Bangqin's flowers seem to be beautiful and strong. Hu Cuizhong's watercolor vertical axis, composed of pure Western paintings, has a national style and its unique style.</p>
<p>Turning around the entire room, in front of each painting, following its changes and transforming the mood, it condenses into a general point. Art transcends fame and fortune and is not ashamed of struggle. Artists raise the meaning of life, strengthen the value of life, and awaken the soul of life. What they give is not only the surface of the painting, not only the exquisite craftsmanship, but also an unsoiled life. Walking out of this palace of art, being re-engaged in the human tide, the impression of the past hour, like a long rainbow, wrapped around in my mind, for a long time forever.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Football Li Hua Cup: Hua Lian Loses to Military United, Li Tiansheng Injured Arm, Whole Army Collapses</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Hong Kong football, after the New Year holiday, Hua Lian and Military United played in a cup match. Hua Lian has won the championship four times, the most recent being in 1940. If they could defeat Military United this year, and then defeat the clerks, they could create a preliminary achievement of consecutive championships. After one hundred and ten minutes of dramatic battle, the United team performed surprisingly well. The two defenders intercepted and flanked, their positions were appropriate. The five forwards on the front line had speed above all else, they could charge and shoot, and their passing was excellent. The five forwards of the Hua Lian team were not coordinated enough, each fighting for themselves, and failed to achieve a planned offensive. In addition, due to the long game, their physical strength was not as good as Military United's. Defender Li Tiansheng bravely intercepted a shot, but unfortunately broke his right arm and was injured and left the field, only fighting with ten men. In the first half, Hua Lian's military appearance was very strong, taking the lead with a score of one to zero. After the break, the score was reported as a one-to-one stalemate. After Li was injured and left the field, the formation was chaotic, and Hua Lian was one-sided, suffering a crushing defeat at the end. The hope for the championship and the International Cup were lost. The Li Hua Cup was once again out of reach for Hua Lian. The lineups of both sides in this match are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Rumors Abound: Gold Market Plunges</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash Shanghai black market showed a significant decline, and sellers were enthusiastic. From 6692 yuan after the opening, it gradually declined to a low price of 6633 yuan before the evening closing. This was due to negative rumors overflowing. There were many rumors about the Japanese Prime Minister, and the foreign exchange also showed a slight hardening. Therefore, Ren Cheng Yong, Xinfeng, Yong, and Deji came to sell, and the first drop reached 6640 yuan. The noon closing recovered more than 20 yuan. The after-market opened immediately, because Xinfeng Yong, Yili, etc. suddenly purchased, raising it to 6662 yuan, while Xiangxing Yong, Hengji, and Defu's final selling stirred up the market, and it suddenly dropped to 6633 yuan. The evening closing was 6636 yuan. After the closing, the price was 40 yuan, which was lower than the previous day's 47 yuan. Furthermore, the spot market price was 75 yuan higher than the futures price. It was said that Defu had sold, and the total transaction volume for the day was 8000 taels. The price of gold ornaments in silver shops did not move, and customs gold, etc. were flat.</p>
<p>Shanghai Dropped 47 Yuan</p>
<p>The morning initially looked very flat, and the market was calm. The opening was stable at 6675 yuan, but it was 8 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. After the opening, buying slightly increased, and the buyers were still entrusted by exchange merchants, such as Hengji and Dafeng, who continued to search, and the price slowly rose, reaching 6692 yuan. At that time, buying and selling were stuck, and the price fluctuated for a while. Subsequently, rumors about the Japanese cabinet suddenly spread in the market, and selling became more intense. Zhong Ren Cheng Yong, Xinfeng Yong, Deji, and Deda unanimously sold, and although silver houses and other firms occasionally purchased, they were ultimately outnumbered, and the price suddenly dropped by 50 yuan, with the lowest retreating to 6640 yuan. It was also heard that exchange bills were reported to be growing at the same time, and the sluggishness was difficult to reverse. Until noon, Yongcheng and others saw a cheap price and their intention to buy suddenly emerged, and they rose to 6662 yuan, which was the closing. The afternoon opening was smaller, only 6650 yuan, and Deda came to sell, dropping another 2 yuan, to 6648 yuan. Shang Yixin Feng Yili suddenly purchased, pulling it up to 6662 yuan. However, Xiangxing Yong, Hengji, and Defu re-stirred up the buying, and the decline became more intense, dropping to 6633 yuan. It was settled in the evening, and the closing was 6636 yuan, and Defu sold 40 taels after the closing, doing 6640 yuan, which was 47 yuan lower than the previous day. The daily rise and fall was only 56 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's gold brand was more than 10 yuan higher than that of Shanghai black market, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current standard gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Still Not Moving</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver ornaments per tael still had no change. It is estimated that Datong Heng hangs 690 yuan, and the new peers are similar to the previous price, and the purchase is 30 yuan lower, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Mostly Fell, Few Rose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Shanghai black market prices hovered and trended downward. British and American gold pounds also decreased by one yuan each. British gold bills also trended stagnant, and the market price stood flat. American gold bills initially rose to 18 yuan, 5.6 points, but then fell, eventually ending at 18 yuan, 4.7 points, which was 8 points lower than the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong bills decreased slightly, and the market price decreased slightly by one point. The rising trend of Japanese gold bills did not stop, and the evening market was 1 yuan, 6.5 and a half points. Korean bills continued to weaken, and the evening market retreated to 1 yuan, 2.9 points.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Prices Return to Flat, Arrivals Totaling 12,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice still presented a situation of being tight first and then tired. At the beginning of the morning market, the shops in this street had a lot of purchasing appetite. Subsequently, the buying interest of rural customers was also strong. Therefore, the sellers' minds were restored firmly, and they took the opportunity to raise prices, and the situation was tighter than before. The small ground rice had the widest path and immediately raised the Yuan Stone, opening at 75 yuan and a half. However, although other goods also saw tightness, they were not as smooth as the small ground rice. Therefore, the market sales declined, and the selling price gradually returned lower. As a result, except for the small pattern, which saw an increase of about half a yuan compared to before, other goods were only flat. As for the closing quotations, No. 1 New Saigon was 83 yuan and a half to 82 yuan and a half, old goods were 84 to 5 yuan, No. 2 was 80 yuan to 78 yuan, No. 1 Siam was 83 yuan to 81 yuan and a half, Zhongjue was 80 yuan to 79 yuan, No. 2 was 78 yuan to 77 yuan and eight corners, Huojiao was 82 yuan to 81 yuan, Xiaojiao pointed at 75 yuan two corners to 75 yuan, Pudong Stack at 74 yuan two corners to 73 yuan eight corners, Da Jiao 72 yuan seven corners, Broken Point at 65 yuan half to 62 yuan, Rice Tea Special at 723 yuan to 70 yuan. Original bags, due to unconfirmed rumors, Fu Duoxian sold off to profit, and foreign firms kept selling, so the market turned from rise to fall, and the returned goods opened No. 1 Saigon in February at 96 yuan and a half, the same in February and March, No. 2 is currently at 91 yuan and one corner, Xiaojiao in January 16 and 89 yuan and a half, currently at 80 yuan to 88 yuan and a half, January 15 at 88 yuan and seven corners, January at 89 yuan and 88 yuan and a half, February at 88 yuan. In the afternoon, because Heyi threw out 3,000 tons of Xiaojiao in March, priced at 88 yuan and one corner and four points, and there was still a balance of more than 2,000 tons, the buyers immediately relaxed, and the market continued to suppress several corners. The total transaction of existing rice throughout the day was less than 8,000 bags, and the return was only 800 tons, all of which were scattered transactions.</p>
<p>Thin glutinous rice and other national rice arrived in scattered quantities, continuing to arrive. However, the shops' willingness to purchase was still not pleasant, so the market was flat, and the selling prices were all lacking in glory or shame. Changbang's original special rice was still 107 yuan, the bucket saw a special 1023 yuan, Kunshan original white rice 1045 yuan, the bucket saw 101 to 97 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice saw 94 yuan and a half, 94 yuan, the original bag was 98 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the path of glutinous rice was more active, there were still a lot of goods being sold, resulting in similar supply and demand, and the selling price still lacked change. Hong Kong white yuan opened at 80 yuan to 789 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continued to come to Shanghai. The French postal ship Kindai arrived at the port at 9 am yesterday, directly loaded with 12,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, and docked at the Hongkou Huashun Wharf for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Already on the Way</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was already facing a bottleneck. Since the active sales to customers during the New Year, the market has been quite consolidated, and speculative hoarders have also secretly bought, all fearing that overseas sources will be blocked. Yesterday, according to a telegram from a foreign firm, the first batch of Australian flour on the way will arrive around the 20th, and another large batch will arrive at the beginning of the month. Therefore, people's hearts are relaxed, and the customer base has turned lukewarm. However, those who hold the goods are still unwilling to sell lightly due to the international changes. Therefore, the market has entered a holding state. No transactions were made for Flower Bird and Clock Tower brand flour in the morning. It was only in the afternoon that a few transactions were made, estimating that the Flower Bird and Diamond Tower brand was 24 yuan, 78 corners, and Jubao Basin was 24 yuan, 56 corners, and more than 3,000 bags were traded. The road goods still opened at 24 yuan and 5 corners, and February and March were around 24 yuan. The market is all brewing. Chinese factories still sell flat flour at 23 yuan for the original plate, and the two factories supply 6,932 bags. The local street needs are already sufficient.</p>
<p>At this time when wheat is about to run out, it is not easy for Chinese factories to purchase raw materials. The foreign wheat that was previously ordered has already been loaded but has not yet been transported. The daily factory gate price is still 12 yuan to 32 yuan and 56 corners. The amount received each day is two or three hundred bags, and the amount received since the New Year is less than 10,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Rise Sharply, Retracing a Considerable Amount</h3>
<p>The public bond black market saw a sudden rebound yesterday. With the new long positions of large investors and the short covering of various parties, the market price suddenly rebounded by more than one yuan. Delong Hongda Lianyi bought very enthusiastically, and the price of Type C bonds suddenly broke through 5 yuan. However, Xinfu Yuxing came to sell again, and Defu also sold a lot. The price then fell again. Lianhe first entered and then exited, and Tongkang first exited and then entered, with a rather indecisive trend. Although Xie Kang and Ren Chang bought, Renfeng Dechang and Fuchang still sold. The high price retraced by 5 or 6 corners. Currently, after this major drop, the difference between Type E and Type C bonds is almost 2 yuan, which is too disparate compared to the previous difference of 3, 4, or 5 corners. Therefore, currently, Types A and E are cheaper. Type A is scheduled to be drawn on the 10th of this month. This decision is the 11th, and it is estimated that as many as 36 will be drawn. Yesterday's results showed that only Type A fell by 5 points, and the rest were slightly better by 2 to 4 corners. 96 was also better by 1 and a half corners. The transaction volume was around 1.4 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 21 yuan and 7 and a half corners.</p>
<p>The closing trend of various industry stocks was uncertain. Many people took profits, but at the same time, there was no shortage of people covering shorts. Some stocks temporarily seemed to be trending slightly softer, but the overall underlying trend was still stable. Rubber stocks remained quiet.</p>
<p>London 6th (Thursday) Telegram: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and stocks of British merchant Eastern companies remained stagnant. Only HSBC Bank's Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 2 pounds, priced at 83 pounds. The rest did not move.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Shantou Gang Sells Spot Yarn Short, Double Horse etc. All Fell</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been fluctuating wildly for several days, turned downwards yesterday. This was because customer sales stopped, and the transportation of Shayu Chong was hindered. Therefore, the Hong Kong gang was helpless. The Shantou gang, on the other hand, reduced prices to sell the spot yarn it had purchased in the past, so the prices of miscellaneous brand yarns fell step by step, and the decline was very severe. However, the bulls were still making every effort to support, so the decline was still able to be缓和. However, judging from the general trend, it is necessary to revolve once temporarily, and wait for the spot sales to improve before the market can flourish again. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,514 yuan, and the low price was 1,483 yuan. The afternoon price started at 1,493 yuan, and then 1,488 yuan. Yesterday, 427 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 40 pieces were shipped to Little Luzon. Double Horse opened in the morning, because the Guangbang customers still lacked development news, the traders in the market lacked strength, and the market was peaceful. The first price was 1,506 yuan. As soon as this price opened, the selling momentum became stronger. As for the securities gang bulls, they also watched and gradually fell to 1,493 yuan. As soon as the low price was seen, the major players came to 相高 and raised the price. They gave out 500 yuan outside the customs, at 1,514 yuan. Unexpectedly, in the midst of the chaos, due to the stagnation of spot sales, some holders of miscellaneous brand yarns, seeing that the way out was blocked, suddenly came to sell, and the decline suddenly arose, falling straight to 1,483 yuan. The closing was slightly better, at 1,491 yuan. The daily trading statistics were 9,000 packages, all of which were speculative transactions, and no customer gangs had traded.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Daily Clearing</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation followed the yarn market and turned downstream. The factory's demand has been reduced. In fact, although prices have risen step by step, the yarn market has been stagnant, and the customer gangs have sold off spot yarn, so the raw materials have become tired.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was quiet and firm, rising due to purchases by spot merchants and fellow traders. The settlement was about 35 points higher than the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian cotton was flat and tired. Yesterday, the forecast also fell by one rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trade remained in a state of watching by all parties yesterday, and there were very few buyers, so the market was quiet and returned to a stagnant state. However, this is only a temporary hesitation and is not enough to block the active cotton market. It is expected that the lively period is still not far away.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Fabric Street Sales Activate</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday. Spot transactions on this street are gradually developing. Customer sales are sluggish due to inconvenient transportation, and the purchasing appetite is weak. The selling price of coarse cloth fell by 2.5 yuan per piece. Fine cloth twill was flat, and dyed cloth also had little difference. More than 600 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street, including more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth purchased by the Zhejiang and Fujian gangs, and more than 200 pieces of fine cloth purchased by the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs. More than 5,000 pieces of bleached cloth and colored cloth were handled by Fengwai Singapore and other places.</p>
<p>The transaction of Dongbu white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill was not prosperous, and it revolved and declined, falling by 2.5 to 5 corners per piece. The closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 50 yuan and 0.1 yuan. The after-market black market price was 50 yuan and 0.2 yuan. The Si Junzi Serge was 1 yuan and 3.5 points. The Longtou futures traded on the "Transaction Place" closed at 50 yuan and 0.8 yuan in January, 52 yuan and 3 corners in February, 51 yuan and 4.9 corners in April, and 54 yuan and 1 corner in May.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Depressed</h3>
<p>The trend of the sugar market continued to turn flat yesterday. In the association's drawing, no spot transactions were made for 24 coarse white foreign stack. Futures all fell by several corners. The month of the 10th delivered 81 yuan corner to two corners, little four corners, the 25th of this month was 81 yuan seven corners, little two corners, the 10th of next month was 82 yuan two corners, little two corners, the 12th of next month was 82 yuan one corner. The upper and lower grades of Chebai were all little three corners. Taikoo B Mark West Stack was 81 yuan, Dong Stack was 80 yuan seven corners, DY Mark West Stack was 78 yuan six corners, and HX Mark West Stack was 78 yuan five corners.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Matches and Soap Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The market price of matches is still a raw material panic. The factory does not provide a large amount of supply. The industry is gradually running out of inventory, so the purchase price is rising. The current market price of Phoenix brand is up to 420 yuan per box, Beauty brand is 425 yuan, second-class miscellaneous brand is 390 yuan, and third-class miscellaneous brand is 370 yuan, which is more than 40 yuan higher than the end of the year. People still look high and beautiful.</p>
<p>The market price of soap is strong. The factory's distribution is still rare and limited, and those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell, so the price is gradually increasing. The market price of fixed soap has reached 26 yuan and 8 corners per box, Huang Xiangmao soap is 19 yuan and 8 corners per box, and Bai Xiangmao soap is 24 yuan per box. Still looking upwards.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Supply and Demand Uneven</h3>
<p>The mountain situation of soybeans has been in a hard situation for a long time. The reason is that the northern river flow is related, and the transport is rare, and the source is reduced. Although the path has no barriers, the cargo owner has low profits, and the market is still immobile. Under the diligent circumstances of the Hong Kong, Xiamen, Shantou, and this street offices, the market did not show a tired trend due to rumors that the oil cake was being used by a certain country. As a result, it rose by 4 to 5 corners compared with the previous day. It is estimated that more than 6,000 bags of Tianjin beans were traded, priced at 40 yuan and 5 corners to 41 yuan, 2,000 bags of Xiao Island beans, priced at 38 yuan and 3 corners to 38 yuan and 5 corners, more than 2,000 bags of Guide mutual, priced at 16 yuan and 8 corners to 37 yuan, and 300 bags of Tianjin green beans, priced at 35 yuan and 7 corners. Chongming Sha Huang 90 bags, priced at 36 yuan and 5 corners. 385 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong on the 7th, 150 bags were shipped to Little Luzon, and 7,190 bags were shipped to Singapore. 290 bags of sesame were connected to Hong Kong and 60 bags to Little Luzon.</p>
<h3>Metals: Pure Antimony and Steel Bars Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Pure Antimony: The source of domestic pure antimony has recently been cut off, and the market stock is extremely small. The standard has been rising steadily, and there is a great fear that there is no goods to buy. The asking price in the market yesterday has risen to 11,000 yuan per ton, which is another 1,000 yuan higher than the red plate.</p>
<p>Steel Bars: Although the transaction of bamboo steel bars has not been lively, (because the construction gang and the northern merchants are purchasing very 清淡,) the market atmosphere is unusually good, and the overseas order is declared to be absolute, and the arrival is also no. What can support the market is only the existing in this port. Therefore, the colleagues' thoughts are good, and the market has risen sharply. The current opening is around 2,400 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Coal: Kailuan Coal Declines Gradually</h3>
<p>Since the price of bituminous coal has fallen in India, the price of second-class goods has also fallen. Yesterday, a company had a large number of Kailuan coal being sold, and cheap coal for the hot water industry was also being distributed at the same time. The black market was inevitably inferior. See downstream, Kailuan coal train blocks, 215 yuan per ton, 5 yuan lower than the red plate, Kailuan debris 264 yuan, stack order delivery, cash transactions.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Flour Market in 1930 (Continued) by Zhou Xigeng</h3>
<p>The above-mentioned factories' products were sold in Shanghai, referred to as "Miscellaneous Brand Flour" due to the variety of brands. Except for Taihe, Guangfeng, Zengfeng, Minfeng, Taifeng, and other factories that managed their own sales, the rest were managed by</p>
<p>Sanxing Flour Company</p>
<p>Dongfu Flour Factory</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Flour Factory</p>
<p>Youheng Flour Factory</p>
<p>Hengfeng Flour Factory</p>
<p>Huayou Flour Company</p>
<p>Qiangshen Flour Company</p>
<p>These seven companies managed them. And by</p>
<p>Mitsui Bussan</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Corporation</p>
<p>Arai &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Yoshida Gomei Kaisha</p>
<p>Tofuku Industrial Co.</p>
<p>Datong Company</p>
<p>Fuda Company</p>
<p>Yokoyama Trading Co.</p>
<p>Zengxing Trading Co.</p>
<p>Yonghe Trading Co.</p>
<p>Yinghua Trading Co.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Industrial Co.</p>
<p>These twelve companies separately acted as agents for the sale and purchase of wheat flour, bran, and other by-products. In the late summer and early autumn of last year, in addition to the Japanese controlled dumping of inland flour into the North China, Central China, and South China markets, all remaining amounts could still be transported to Shanghai for competitive sale. At that time, the price of flour from local Shanghai factories was 13.5 yuan per bag, while inland flour arriving in Shanghai cost only around 13 yuan per bag, including fees. As a result, some flour merchants came up with an outlandish idea: using flour sacks from Shanghai factories, they chose those with popular trademarks, filled them with flour from inland flour factories, repackaged them and falsely presented them as products of Shanghai flour factories. For example, if inland flour cost 13 yuan per bag delivered to Shanghai, plus about 10 cents for replacing the Shanghai factory's flour sack, and sold at the factory price of 13.5 yuan per bag, a net profit of over 40 cents could be made. This was incomparable to the few cents of commission earned by legitimately dealing in genuine factory flour. However, the skill level in changing the sacks (also called repackaging) varied greatly. The clever ones were highly skilled, and the sewn seams of the flour bags looked as if they had never been opened. Those with poor skills, however, could easily be identified as having replaced the sacks at a glance. The average consumer was generally unaware of the inside story and often suffered losses. Some flour merchants, during the sack-changing process, would steal anywhere from half a pound to a pound of flour. Assuming they changed 100 bags, stealing half a pound from each bag would result in an extra 50 pounds of flour, which, at 13 yuan per bag, would be like getting another bag for free. (At the current price of over 24 yuan, the profit would be doubled). Even more greedy flour merchants would mix lower-grade flour with higher-grade flour, then pour the mixture into factory flour sacks and display them for sale. The immense profits earned this way are unimaginable. Meanwhile, the sales of genuine factory flour were hindered. By September, inland flour and flour from factories in the suburbs of Shanghai were no longer allowed to be transported into the concessions (a small amount was transported by bicycle from Nanxiang via Zhabei, but this was limited and soon stopped). Therefore, the miscellaneous brands of flour from inland disappeared from the concessions.</p>
<p>(4) Black Market and Flour Prices</p>
<p>When the Shanghai flour market was tight, Shanghai businesses ordered a huge amount of Australian flour, totaling around 1.5 million bags. The cheapest price per bag delivered to Shanghai was about 16.5 yuan, and the highest was about 18.5 yuan, the price differences caused by foreign exchange fluctuations. By December of last year, about 500,000 bags had arrived at the port, and the rest were expected to arrive in Shanghai successively during February, March, April. In theory, the flour market should have had assistance, and the market situation could have been expected to calm down. However, in reality, Shanghai flour factories did not have ample reserves of raw materials, and the inland miscellaneous brand flour was banned from coming to Shanghai. With rice prices rising steadily, speculators set their sights on purchasing and hoarding flour. However, there was very little factory flour available, so the imported flour arriving in Shanghai became the only target for these speculators. The black market for flour operated every morning except on holidays. The price of imported flour rose from around 19 yuan to as much as 24.8 yuan. This trading activity had exceeded the scope of supply and demand and entered a state of crazy speculation. The flour black market was formed due to the unemployment of some flour and bran workers. They started with a small corner at the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange on Edward Road just for conversation,</p>

<h3>"Special Police for West Shanghai" To Be Established - Police Authority in the Northern District Awaits Resolution - Both Sides Appoint "Chief" and "Deputy Chief" - Suppression of Gambling Dens May Be Difficult</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources last night, the Municipal Council has received notification from the "Municipal Government" appointing Pan Zhijie as the "Chief of the Special Police Bureau for West Shanghai." At the same time, the Municipal Council has recommended Christopher as the "Deputy Chief." All personnel recommended by the Municipal Council will be announced successively. According to Japanese sources, the "Special Police Bureau for West Shanghai" is scheduled to be officially established on the first of next month. Chief Pan Zhijie is now beginning preparations, and visited the Chairman of the Municipal Council, Cornell, the Secretary-General, and the Police Commissioner Bowen at 10 AM the day before yesterday to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Organizational Issues Still to Be Discussed</p>
<p>According to the official announcement, the Municipal Council today appointed Police Superintendent Hall as the "Chief of Foreign Affairs Section of the Special Police" and Police Superintendent Breckenridge as the "Chief of the Criminal Section." Some believe that the "Special Police" will be established at the beginning of next month. However, officials remain silent on the matter. It is said that before the "Special Police" begin to exercise their authority, several details are still pending discussion between Pan Zhijie and "Deputy Chief" Christopher within the month, regarding various issues related to the organization of the "Special Police," such as the number of personnel in each department, the location of "sub-bureaus," uniforms, etc., for the final decision.</p>
<p>Suppression of Vice Likely to Face Obstacles</p>
<p>It is reported that after the Public Concession authorities approved the appointment of the "Deputy Chief" of the Special Police, the two sides would soon exchange approvals of the personnel appointed by the other party. However, no announcement has been made regarding the closure of gambling dens and other criminal organizations, or the issue of taxation. Some believe that taxation will not be difficult, as the funds collected will be used exclusively for the needs of the district. Regarding the closure of gambling dens and other criminal activities, some believe that this will encounter some difficulties.</p>
<p>New Police to Be Responsible for Security in the Western District</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reported that, according to authoritative sources today, after the new "Special Police Force" for West Shanghai is organized, all "extra police force" on the roads beyond the boundary will be abolished. It is reported that the police activities in the district will be solely responsible by the "new police force" from now on and will immediately take measures to ensure the "special agency" on Jessfield Road will soon be removed from the building. At the same time, the "Municipal Government" "police" and the Japanese Military Police in the Western District will also cease activities. Negotiations regarding the closure of gambling dens and other criminal activities in the district will reportedly soon be conducted by "Police Chief Pan Zhijie and "Deputy Chief" Christopher appointed by the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Mr. Christopher's Service Experience</p>
<p>The newly appointed "Deputy Chief of the Special Police," Christopher, joined the Police Department in 1914. In 1924, he received a long-service medal and is one of the longest-serving members of the Municipal Council Police Department. Mr. Christopher has gradually risen through the ranks from humble positions, becoming the Police Superintendent of the Zha Bei Police Station in 1936, and recently promoted to "Deputy Chief of the Special Police." Mr. Christopher is good at sports and is well known in the city's sports circles.</p>
<h3>Police Authority in the Northern District Urgently Needs Resolution</h3>
<p>Yesterday, related officials stated that, in view of the gradual and complete restoration of normal police affairs on the roads beyond the boundary in West Shanghai, the establishment of a "new police district" in the Northern District of the concession, known as "Area E," will be announced in the shortest possible time. According to this, the "new police district" was proposed last year by the former Japanese Consul General Miura, who at the same time participated in the temporary agreement on police authority in West Shanghai with the former Chairman of the Municipal Council Fessenden and Fu Xiaoan. According to Miura's intention, the establishment of the "new police district" will restore the Northern District to a normal state, so that it can be governed by the Deputy Police Superintendent and Japanese police.</p>
<p>Loss of Taxes is Substantial Every Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities claimed that negotiations on this issue have been "delayed," but the reason was not explained. However, officials stated yesterday morning that once the establishment of the "Special Police" in West Shanghai is fully realized, the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities will resume negotiations to resolve the issue of police authority in "Area E." It is understood that, at present, due to the Japanese "occupation" of the Northern District, the Municipal Council cannot collect the license fees for all 250 public buses of the "China Urban Public Bus Company," as well as 1,000 other vehicles and rickshaws. In the past two and a half years, the loss of taxes has reached 2 million yuan per year. Although the situation in the Northern District is so abnormal, the Municipal Council continues to bear the responsibility for road repairs and police affairs in the district. It is also unjust that, according to the current situation in the Northern District, patrolmen of the Public Concession cannot be armed on duty.</p>
<h3>Cornell Travels to Hong Kong for a Short Rest - Board Member Cana Returns to the United States Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chairman of the Municipal Council Cornell was injured by Lin Xiongji on the 23rd of last month. His left hand injury has not fully healed, and he still wears a black bandage, suspended around his neck. Now that the Taxpayers' Meeting has ended, for the sake of recuperation in another place, he has requested leave from the Council.

In addition, Deputy Chairman Cana is retiring due to old age and will return to the United States tomorrow evening on the Creole. His vacancy has been filled by Mitchell, the general manager of the Taikoo Company.</p>

<h3>Over One Million Bags of Rice in Storage - No Need to Worry About the People's Food - Crackdown on Hoarding Still in Place to Prevent Price Increases - Rice Shipments from Hong Kong Continue as Usual, Market Rumors Cease</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market saw a continuous decline in prices due to the influx of goods in recent days and substantial reserves, prices have returned to normal. It is generally expected that the total amount of foreign rice arriving this month will reach one million bags, and combined with existing reserves, the total amount of rice stored in the city will reach 1.4 to 1.5 million bags, breaking the city's highest rice storage record. The foreign rice already ordered for March has reached 130,000 bags.</p>
<p>Stabilizing the Rice Market Has Been Effective</p>
<p>Whenever rice prices rise, the Public Concession authorities urge rice industry groups and various industries to order large quantities of foreign rice. However, the number of arrivals has never been as large as it is now. Therefore, the authorities' measures to stabilize the city's rice supply have had a significant effect. Rice prices should be stable from now on. However, attention should be paid to: (1) How to prevent hoarders from stockpiling after a large amount of foreign rice arrives in Shanghai, thereby manipulating market prices. (2) Banning exports. (3) Cracking down on rumors that affect the rice market, because unfounded rumors spread in the market can affect rice prices.</p>
<p>The Authorities' Suggestions Seem to Be Old Cases</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Municipal Council, in order to prevent hoarding and speculation on food, approved the Food Commission's suggestion and submitted seven measures to the Rice Market Management Committee, urging their implementation. A reporter specifically inquired with the committee yesterday afternoon. According to reports, the committee had not received the Municipal Council's suggestion as of yesterday. The reporter then asked a gentleman familiar with the rice market, who said that most of the seven measures suggested by the Municipal Council as reported in the newspaper were the new eight measures to adjust the rice market suggested by the French Concession Board's Price Equalization Committee to the Public Concession Food Commission on June 8 of last year.</p>
<p>Measures to Stop Speculation Already Being Implemented</p>
<p>According to the reporter's reliable investigation, the current rice market has already implemented strict measures to prevent speculation, including: (1) Those who join the rice market for business are limited to: (A) members of the Rice Industry Association, (B) members of the Rice Shop Association, (C) members of the Broker Association, (D) members of the Broker Friendship Association. When new members enter the market for business, they must be guaranteed by two fellow traders. Before the establishment of the Broker Friendship Association, those who joined the market for business also needed to provide a guarantee. After the association was established, the association was responsible. (2) Since September of the year before last (1929), the market has required that after a rice transaction is completed, an entry order must be filled out, and the seller must fill out an exit order. The total number of transactions with the buyer must be reported to the authorities every day. (3) Last month, the Bean and Rice Association resolved to shorten the delivery date of rice transactions from ten days to five days and to prepay a deposit of five yuan. If the deadline is exceeded, the deposit will be forfeited.</p>
<p>Urge Various Industries to Continue Ordering Foreign Rice</p>
<p>As for the latest statistics on inventory and arrivals, the Shanghai Rice and Grain Price Equalization Committee already has this task, but it has not reached a precise level, because while foreign rice arrivals can be counted, the source of domestic rice is not concentrated in one place and is difficult to calculate. The current method of purchasing at least ten bags should be maintained, and the trade in rice that has not yet arrived should be limited to reliable wholesale rice merchants and so on. In short, the current methods of stabilizing the rice market are still urging various industries to directly order foreign rice from abroad to replenish the city's reserves, cracking down on unfounded rumors to prevent rice prices from rising, and continuing to handle price equalization as soon as possible, which is also sufficient to stabilize the city's rice prices.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Has Not Banned Rice Exports</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, there were rumors in the rice market that the Hong Kong authorities, in order to prepare for the rice rains, had again ordered a ban on rice exports and the suspension of the issuance of rice transit permits, which caused anxiety among the people. Most rice merchants believed that if Hong Kong banned rice exports, the shipments of foreign rice to Shanghai would gradually decrease, so they hoarded goods and refused to easily sell all the spot goods, waiting for a better price to sell. The market was tight. It has now been confirmed that the rumor is purely unfounded and is a deliberate fabrication by speculative rice merchants in an attempt to raise prices and make profits. The following is a transcript of a telegram received yesterday by a certain rice shop from its Hong Kong counterpart: "Your telegram is acknowledged. Hong Kong rice has not been banned from export. Orders are still being shipped and will be shipped in the coming days." In addition, it is reported that every afternoon recently, a group of rice merchants has been privately trading rice at the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Exchange at 15 Edward Road, which is not good for the future of the people's food and clothing. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will severely crack down on this. If this is true, then the industry association should know about it, but keeps silent. This is truly regrettable.</p>
<h3>Date of Municipal Council Election Approved by Consular Body - Westerners Strong and Can Maintain Current Status - Japanese Election Attempts Unlikely to Succeed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council suggested to the Consular Body the day before yesterday that April 2nd and 3rd be set as the dates for the Municipal Council elections. This proposal was approved by the leading Consul Hill yesterday. The Municipal Council now plans to submit a proposal to the Consular Body within the next few days to convene the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers on April 16th. Once approved, all taxpayers will be notified, and the Secretariat will be instructed to carry out preparations.</p>
<p>American Community Had Discussions Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the American Association and the American Chamber of Commerce convened a special meeting of the executive committee, chaired by Chairman Macmillan. In addition to a general review of general association affairs, the meeting also discussed contingency plans to prepare for campaigning for the Municipal Council. It also nominated several candidates for the board. As for the number and names of the candidates, they have not yet been announced. It is generally believed that these candidates will be well-known figures in the American community, there is no doubt. The British community will also convene a meeting at the British Association at 27 The Bund within the next few days. The main agenda will also be to nominate five candidates for the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>British and American Line Will Still Win</p>
<p>According to observers, the election procedures have been based on Article 18 of the Jingbang Land Regulations since 1869 and have never been changed. Usually, the Municipal Council elections are held on the election day (2nd) from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and the ballots are counted by the tellers designated by the Municipal Council. The nine candidates with the most votes are elected as the next board of directors. This system has not changed so far, so it is expected that the outcome of the election will not have much change. Because the voting strength of Westerners is several times that of the Japanese. Although the number of Japanese in Hongkou has been increasing recently, the British and Americans still have the most assets. It is still difficult to determine the current attitude of the Japanese. They seem to be planning to adopt a new policy, but the Japanese may not have much confidence in being able to overwhelm the British and Americans to achieve their goal of occupying five seats on the board.</p>

<h3>Wanted Criminal for Attempted Murder, Lin Xiongji, Actually Released on Bail - Preliminary Hearing by Japanese Consulate Ended - To Be Sent to Nagasaki Court for Public Trial</h3>
<p>Lin Xiongji, the chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, who shot and wounded Cornell, the chairman of the Municipal Council, at the Taxpayers' Meeting on the 23rd of last month, has admitted to the crime after being arrested and sent to the Japanese Consulate Police Station for investigation. It has been two weeks. According to Japanese newspapers, Lin Xiongji, the perpetrator of such a major international assassination attempt, was released on bail by the Japanese Consulate on the day after the Taxpayers' Meeting was reopened (6th) to await a public trial. He will be sent to Nagasaki, Japan, to await trial.</p>
<p>Preliminary Hearing Concluded, Awaiting Transfer to Nagasaki</p>
<p>The case of Lin Xiongji's attempted murder has ended after being sent to the judicial authorities for preliminary hearing on January 25th. He will soon be sent to the Nagasaki District Court in Japan for a public trial. During the preliminary hearing, Lin has directly admitted to the criminal facts and is quite remorseful. Although he has been allowed to be released on bail, he can only live cautiously and vows not to destroy evidence or escape.</p>
<p>After Leaving the Consulate, He Visited Temples</p>
<p>After Lin was granted permission to be released on bail, his wife and relatives, including An Lin Yuanwu, rushed to the Japanese Consulate at around 5:50 PM on the 6th to deliver clothes, and left in his own car No. 4673. First, he went to Higashi Honganji Temple to comfort his ancestors, then to Nishi Honganji Temple, and then to the Shanghai Shrine at the Naval Cemetery on North Sichuan Road to pay his respects. At 6:40 PM, he returned to his home on Pinle'an Road to recuperate and await formal trial. He said nothing about the attempted murder case.</p>
<p>General Speculation on the Severity of the Sentence</p>
<p>According to general speculation, the act of pulling out a gun and shooting the authority of the Municipal Council in a public place has been directly admitted by the perpetrator. Combined with the perpetrator's remarks before the meeting, his premeditated murder is very obvious. Even if the murder was not successful, his crime cannot be easily reduced by any measure. Now, he has been allowed to be released on bail, even if there is no fear of escape, who knows if he will destroy evidence? Or perhaps the perpetrator himself already knows that he can be given a lighter sentence.</p>
<h3>Japanese Deputy Secretary-General Soku Resigns - Japanese Recommend a Replacement - Name Not Yet Announced</h3>
<p>Ibusuki Hirohide, the Japanese Deputy Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has resigned due to dissatisfaction with the Japanese authorities. He will leave his post at the end of this month. Last month, the Japanese Consulate recommended a Japanese person as his successor to the Municipal Council for approval, but then voluntarily withdrew the recommendation and recommended another person. The Municipal Council also expressed its agreement. However, neither the Council nor the Japanese Consulate has announced the name, but it will always be a person who is deeply supported by the Japanese community.</p>
<h3>Telegrams from Kong Xiangxi and Others to the Family of Jin Huating</h3>

<h3>Unified National Railway Rehabilitation Bonds, Fixed Payment Date - Rehabilitation Bond Principal and Interest, Paid and Remitted by Shanghai Branches</h3>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee will hold a lottery on February 10th (Monday) at 10:00 AM in Shanghai to redeem the principal of the Class A bonds of the 1936 Unified National Bond and the first and second issues of the Third Railway Construction Bond. It has sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Silver and Money Industry Association, the First Special District Court, and the representatives of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China to attend the event for supervision. The payment dates for the first and second issues of the Construction Bond are set for February 28th, and the Class A Unified Bond is set for July 31st. The measures will be promulgated by the Ministry of Finance at that time.</p>
<p>The tenth principal and interest payment of the 1936 Rehabilitation Bond will be made on February 28th by the Central Bank and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications entrusted by it, with a total of 1.7 million yuan for principal redemption and 9.7411 million yuan for interest payment. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank yesterday that it has received an order from the head office regarding the redemption of principal and payment of interest on the Rehabilitation Bond, and it will make full payment on schedule. The Shanghai branch will pay and remit in six installments, which is exactly the same as the Unified Bond. The bank has prepared everything after receiving the order. The rumors that payments will be made from Hong Kong are not true.</p>
<h3>Relief Medicines from the United States Detained by Japan - En Route from Sha Yu Chong Port to Shao Guan - One Said the Number Detained Was Not Large</h3>
<p>According to sources here, a large number of medical supplies sent by the American Red Cross to China for disaster relief have been detained by the Japanese. It is reported that the detention location is near Sha Chong. One said that the number of relief medicines was not large and were being transported to the mainland via the Hong Kong-Shao Guan Highway. Most of the medicines had already been transported through that route. American officials have not made any comments on this because they have not received a detailed report.</p>
<h3>Postal Worker Subsidies - Another Proposal</h3>
<p>All employees of the Shanghai Postal Administration and its affiliated branches, due to financial difficulties, requested through the Shanghai Postal Workers Union and the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union that the Director, Mr. Chaplin, issue year-end bonuses, including various living subsidies. It is now known that the above request has been approved by the Kunming General Post Office and will be issued before the end of the year. However, the issue of increasing the cost of living allowance has not yet been fully resolved. When the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union held its seventh supervisory board meeting the other day, the General Affairs Department reported that the plan previously drafted by the Cost of Living Adjustment Committee had been submitted to the authorities by the union to request the General Post Office to increase the cost of living allowance. The Director has now replied, stating that the plan is not yet perfect and should be reconsidered with a new method. The union has made thorough studies and has not yet found a proper method. It has now drafted a new plan and should be jointly studied. After discussion, it was decided that because the bureau had previously provided a universal relief subsidy of 15 yuan per person in 1929 due to the high cost of living, and now the cost of living has increased even more, although there has been an increase in subsidies and rice allowances, it is still not enough. The authorities should increase the relief subsidy by 100 yuan and use this number as the base number. For every 100% increase in the cost of living in the future, 30 yuan will be added, and when it falls, 30 yuan will be deducted. It was resolved to request the authorities to strive for the support of the General Post Office.</p>
<h3>Qu County, Pingyang and Other Places: Plague Spreads</h3>
<p>After the plague in Ningbo was eradicated, it has now spread to Qu County, Pingyang, and other places. Although active prevention and control measures have been taken, it has not yet been completely eradicated. In order to prevent problems before they arise, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has specially formulated emergency measures, which the Zhejiang Provincial Shanghai-based Associations have received. A record of them is listed below:</p>
<p>Emergency Measures</p>
<p>Emergency Measures (1) Zhejiang Province, in order to prevent the spread of plague and to seek its rapid eradication, in addition to the provisions already stipulated in the Infectious Disease Prevention Regulations, hereby specially formulates these measures. (2) All counties shall strictly abide by the Zhejiang Provincial Plague Epidemic Reporting Measures to report the epidemic situation and shall not delay. If there is any delay, and thereby the epidemic prevention work is delayed, severe punishment will be imposed. (3) On the day of the discovery of the plague, each county shall immediately organize an epidemic prevention committee, with the local party, government, military, police, and health agencies as members, and the county magistrate as the chairman. The committee will be divided into general affairs, blockade, isolation and treatment, environmental sanitation and quarantine, vaccination, propaganda and recruitment, and supply and burial groups. The organizational measures will be formulated separately and submitted to the Provincial Health Department for approval and record. (4) The location where the plague is discovered shall be designated as an epidemic area within a certain area, and shall be quickly and strictly blockaded, and the work of isolation and disinfection shall be rushed.

(7) Rat prevention, insect extermination, and disinfection matters in all departments of the isolation ward shall be strictly enforced. (8) If people in the epidemic area escape to the outside, the heads of villages, towns, and baojia shall be responsible for conducting a strict investigation, and the county shall organize a search team to conduct a search.

<h3>Buddhist Groups Yesterday Commemorated the Panchen Lama; More Than a Hundred People Attended the Ceremony</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bodhi Society and the Buddhist Academic Society and other groups held a memorial meeting for the birthday of the Panchen Lama at the Jueyuan in Hart Road at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. The hall was set up as the Panchen Lama Memorial Hall of the garden, with a bronze statue of the Panchen Lama enshrined above, and fresh flowers and oil lamps displayed on the table. In addition to the esoteric Buddhist statues on the four walls, the three heads and six arms were solemn. More than a hundred people attended the memorial ceremony, including Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Yuanying, Guan Jiongzhi, Shen Binhan, Xie Jiaqian, Lu Deshen, Zhao Mochu, Fan Gunong, etc., led by Rongzeng Kanbu to perform the ceremony. At 10:00 a.m., the ceremony was completed and noodles were served for lunch to share with the participating devotees.</p>
<h3>Plot to Bomb Gao Guanwu; Three People Arrested</h3>
<p>According to Pingmingshe, on the 22nd of last month, when Gao Guanwu, the "Governor" of Jiangsu, was taking a car to the "Public Office," someone pre-buried a bomb to kill him. Unexpectedly, the time had not yet arrived, and the bomb detonated before the car arrived. For a time, the four city gates were tightly closed, and a search was conducted for the person who plotted the murder. It is reported that on February 1st, three suspects were arrested, one was Sun Liangen, 21 years old, the company commander of the Yang Zhong's troops special service team; one was Lu Jian, 28 years old, the adjutant of the military section; and one was Sun Jiazhen, 25 years old, a sergeant squad leader.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Frequently Maneuver in Various Coastal Areas of Eastern Zhejiang; A Large Number of Japanese Troops Gather in Dinghai; Plan to Build Six Highway Lines</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from the shipping industry, Japanese warships have been frequently maneuvering in various coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang recently. Currently, there is one Japanese warship anchored off Chuanshan, three off Shipu, two outside Zhenhai, and four off Zhoushan, totaling more than ten ships, which seems to indicate some attempt on the Zhejiang Sea. In addition, Vice Admiral Shimada Shigetaro, commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China, arrived in Dinghai on the 31st of last month to inspect and step up the blockade of the Zhejiang Sea. In recent days, Japanese troops have been concentrating in Dinghai, totaling about 2,000 people, planning to build six highways from the city to Shenjiamen, Baiquan, Cengang, Xiaosha, and other places. Although they have forcibly conscripted civilian laborers to build them, it is difficult to proceed smoothly because of the undulating mountains and the countryside being under the control of the county government.</p>
<h3>Report of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Department for the Past Year</h3>
<p>Chinese Language Section: The semi-annual examinations of last year were held in June and December respectively, and the results were still excellent. The languages taught were Shanghai dialect and Beijing dialect. Some of the newly employed foreign staff members can only speak Cantonese or other provincial languages. Therefore, at the beginning of their employment, they are examined on the other Chinese languages they have already studied, which are not Shanghai or Beijing dialect, and then they are made to learn the local Chinese dialect of this port. The teaching locations of the instructors are distributed in various districts, with ten locations. Specifically, all police stations, public works and hygiene sub-offices, fire stations, tax collection offices, and prisons have instructors going to teach Chinese. Instructors also go to several hospitals to teach the nurses in the hospitals. All classes are taught during the normal office hours of the entire department. Sometimes it is appropriate to change instructors for students, or to change students for instructors. In the past ten years, there has never been a need to transfer instructors assigned to teach in various districts, because students are often transferred from one district to another, which is enough to ensure that the people they learn from are not limited to the instructors in one district. Under the current method, most students can pass the highest-level examination within the prescribed three-year period.</p>
<p>Translation Section:</p>
<p>The daily duties of this section are to translate the large number of Chinese letters that come from all aspects every day. To be able to do the job well, the staff of this section must have special qualifications. Every translator must be able to be relied upon, have accurate writing, and keep the contents of the documents strictly confidential. Skilled translators are specialized talents who have been trained. Their translations must be closely matched to the original text, without adding or subtracting anything. Translators must be familiar with the special terminology used in various specialized subjects in order to be competent. There are many translation methods, and this section uses no less than ten types, from the abridged summaries required for compiling indexes and catalogs to the formal and legal documents that need to be translated word by word. The effectiveness of the translation section depends on two factors: "absolute accuracy" and "rapid completion." Both are indispensable. The main purpose of the reorganization plan implemented in 1929 was to obtain the highest efficiency with the least amount of time and money. The section has never forgotten this purpose, and the current number of personnel has been reduced to the minimum, including one special translation director, one secretary and stenographer, two Chinese assistants, one compiler, three senior translators, two first-class translators, one second-class translator, two proofreaders, and three messengers, totaling sixteen people.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Subcommittee Rejects Reporters' Participation</h3>
<p>During the special meeting held by taxpayers, it was repeatedly suggested that newspaper reporters be allowed to attend meetings of the Shanghai Municipal Council subcommittees. The reporter asked Mr. Philip, the director-general of the Shanghai Municipal Council, about the feasibility of this matter. According to him, when the Shanghai Municipal Council subcommittees meet to discuss the unfairness of tax rules, they will follow the Shanghai Municipal Council's usual practice of rejecting the participation of newspaper reporters. Due to the lack of facilities for entertaining reporters at the meetings, no information about the matters discussed at the meetings will be released until the reports are produced, in order to maintain this consistent policy.</p>

<h3>Robbery at Shangtian Funeral Parlor; Throwing Bombs to Resist Arrest; Japanese Military Police Arrived to Surround and Arrest; Bomb Did Not Explode, One Criminal Captured</h3>
<p>The Shangtian Funeral Parlor at No. 81 Yananping Road, Shanghai Fourth District, is large in scale and prosperous in business, which has aroused the covetousness of bandits. At about 1:00 p.m. yesterday, three or four bandits suddenly appeared, each carrying pistols and small bombs and other weapons, first pretending to be family members of the deceased,</p>
<p>Mixed into the Parlor</p>
<p>Upstairs, and then one bandit guarded the side of the ladder, and the remaining bandits went straight into the private bedroom of Qian Zongmai, the person in charge of the Parlor, in an attempt to rob him. It happened that Qian was not there, so the bandits threatened the staff in the Parlor. At that time, the staff of the Parlor had already received the police message, and immediately reported to the Japanese side by telephone. The Japanese side then dispatched a large number of Japanese troops to the scene with the "police" and surrounded the Parlor heavily, and the "police"</p>
<p>Opened a volley of gunfire</p>
<p>More than ten shots as a demonstration. At that time, the bandits were still lingering inside. Hearing the gunshots, they knew that things were not good, so in desperation, they threw the hand grenades they were carrying at the Japanese troops and "police," but the bombs did not explode. The bandits then opened fire upstairs to resist arrest. For a time, the gunshots were very intense. The nearby residents did not know the inside story and were all panic-stricken. Soon the Japanese troops brought tear gas bombs and threw them upstairs. The bandits knew that they were outnumbered, so they</p>
<p>Jumped out of the window to escape</p>
<p>However, the main bandit leader, Mao Juesheng, was captured by the Japanese troops when he jumped off the building from the third floor in an attempt to escape. Pistols and other weapons were seized, and he was taken to the military police team for interrogation. Although the Parlor was reported to have been robbed, there was no loss. Only the windows and walls of the building were riddled with bullet holes when both sides opened fire.</p>
<h3>Foreigner Fought Over Love and Fired a Gun; Case Not Prosecuted; Bail Allowed to Be Revoked</h3>
<p>William D. H. Cross, a foreigner who was not subject to consular jurisdiction, had been working as a clerk at the East Asia Transportation Company at No. 17 Guangdong Road. He and a foreign woman named Kemper were in love with each other and were engaged. Recently, Ms. Kemper had an affair with another person. At 5:00 p.m. on the 30th of last month, Cross ran into his fiancée walking hand in hand with a man on the road. He could not help but become jealous and stepped forward to negotiate. Then, he took them both to the residence of Baden, a Western detective of the Central Police Station, Room 4, Pi Building, Bank of China Building, No. 803 Jing'an Temple Road, for negotiations. Unexpectedly, Cross suddenly grabbed Baden's official pistol and ran away. A bullet accidentally came out and injured the leg of Shen Changfa, a Chinese worker for a Westerner. Subsequently, the Chengdu Road Police Station sent detectives to transport the injured person to the hospital for treatment. On the one hand, Cross was taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation, and he was ordered to pay 500 yuan to be released on bail pending further interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu continued the interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that the victim, Shen Changfa, was unwilling to pursue the case, and the police station would not prosecute the case. He requested that the defendant's bail be revoked. The court approved the request.</p>
<h3>Two Coal Briquette Shops Sued for Using Inaccurate Scales</h3>
<p>Qian Zhiqing, the owner of Qian Wanyu Coal Shop at No. 28 Tongfu Road, and Qian Zengyi, the owner of Yi Tai Cheng Coal Shop at No. 210 Tongfu Road, have been deceiving customers by using inaccurate scales. Someone secretly reported them to the Chengdu Road Police Station, who sent detectives to investigate and found that the report was true. They brought the scales back to the police station and requested the First Special Court to issue summonses to prosecute them for fraud. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan summoned them. The defendants did not arrive, and each sent their wives as representatives. The police station's lawyer, Peng Qixin, stated that this type of case involving violations of criminal law could not be represented according to regulations, and requested a postponement so that the defendants could appear in court in person. Judge Zhan ruled to postpone the case for further verification.</p>
<h3>Two Robbers Shot While Resisting Arrest; Interrogated Again After Recovering from Injuries</h3>
<p>Robbers Chen Daohai from Jiangbei and Wang Yinsong from Changzhou, armed with weapons, went to the home of a certain family at No. 1683 Yinghua Lane, Hart Road, at about 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, planning to rob them of their property. The incident was reported to the Putuo Road Police Station, which was in charge of the area. Shan Hua, the Chinese detective, and detective Kong Guangxiao, together with a Western detective, rushed to surround them. The two robbers, Chen and Wang, opened fire to resist arrest. The Chinese and Western detectives also drew their guns and fired back, and as a result, they shot and injured the legs of the two robbers, causing them to fall to the ground and be captured. A pistol was seized, with seven bullets inside. The two men were taken to the police station and then transferred to the patrol police hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, Jiang Baolian, the police station's lawyer, submitted the case transfer form to the Third Criminal Division of the Special Court. Judge Huang ruled to postpone the case for further verification after the two defendants had recovered from their injuries.</p>
<h3>Robbers Commit Robbery; Shot and Captured</h3>
<p>At 10:30 last night, a robber broke into the residence of a certain family on Avenue Pécoul, pulled out a pistol, and intended to rob them. The victim glimpsed that the pistol held by the robber was a fake, and immediately shouted for the police to arrest the robber. The robber knew that things were not good, so he rushed out the door to escape. However, the Chinese police nearby had heard the shout and rushed to the scene. Seeing the robber holding a pistol and fleeing, the Chinese police chased closely behind and fired many shots. The robber was chased to Route Lafayette before being shot in the right leg and falling to the ground, where he was captured. The police summoned a vehicle and sent him to the patrol police hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Opium Addict Dies in Prison</h3>

<h3>Retention</h3>

<p>"I said, wouldn't it be better to let him go to school in a few more years?"</p>
<p>"Six years old is exactly the age to go to school. Why wait a few more years?"</p>
<p>"According to you, if he goes to school at six, then why are you blaming him now that he's being held back?"</p>
<p>"Yes, because he is already six years old, so being held back is—hmph," the father was very angry, so angry that he couldn't speak for a while, until he grabbed his child like a hawk and said, "He's already six years old and still being held back. Even five-year-olds are better than you..."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, the mother snatched the child away. The child had come home with his father today with his report card, and had been scolded enough on the way. He didn't dare speak, and almost cried, but he was afraid his father would hit him; he endured it, enduring it all the way home, and quickly ran into his mother's arms to hide. The mother loved him the most, and of course could be his bodyguard; but the father still refused to give up. He had never seen his father get so angry before, and now he was simply as frightened as a drenched chick.</p>
<p>"Tsk, you still treat him like a treasure," the father roared, "Hugging him in your arms."</p>
<p>"What if I treat him like a treasure?" the mother said, combing the child's hair with her fingers.</p>
<p>"Treating him like a treasure, that's how you spoiled him: playing mahjong, having him stand by your side, when school started, he still couldn't recognize the three characters for 'little cat jumps,' but he knows 'center, prosperity, white' very well. Sleeping with you at night, at least until 10:30, sometimes as late as 12:00; the next morning, sometimes people have already had the first class, and he's still just getting to school. On Sundays, taking him to hotels, theaters, relatives' houses, I've never seen him properly studying at home. Are you his mother? What kind of mother are you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, say what you want, if I'm not his mother, who is? Why does he prefer to be with me and not with you? You good father." The mother didn't want to say any more.</p>
<p>After a while, everyone's anger seemed to have subsided a bit, and the mother asked the child, "You, what rank did you get?"</p>
<p>"What rank? Forty-second place, your treasure got forty-second place," the father replied harshly, replacing the child.</p>
<p>"Then there are still those who are worse than him!" Pausing, the mother lowered her head and said gently to the child, "Aren't there fifty people in your grade?"</p>
<p>"Yes," the child said timidly, somewhat sobbing. The mother still wanted to speak, but the father's loud voice interrupted the mother's words: "Alas, you as a mother, you say it well, 'There are still those who are worse than him.' How can you say that, do you really want him to get fiftieth place?" The father's fire reignited.</p>
<p>At that time, the neighbor upstairs came down to mediate: "Mr. Yang, don't argue, the child doesn't understand!"</p>
<p>"It's precisely because he doesn't understand! That's why the mother should teach him well; but, her son was held back, got forty-second place, and you want to know what she said, she said, 'There are still those who are worse than him!' Ugh, is this how you teach a son?"</p>
<p>The mediator patted the child's back and said, "See, your dad is so worried and distressed for you. Your dad pays for you to go to school, you should study hard and not be held back."</p>
<p>The mother pushed the child to the mediator and ran to the room in a daze, muttering, "You go talk, you're a good father, you're a good—"</p>
<p>After a while, the mediator led the child upstairs, saying, "Mr. Yang, don't be angry, I'll tell the child to study harder."</p>
<p>So Mr. Yang was left alone in the living room, thinking about his child, thinking about such a mother, thinking about the environment, thinking about family education, thinking about...</p>
<h3>Recent News from Le Ren Hospital</h3>
<p>— Zheng</p>
<p>Hiring Doctors, Adding Wards, Improving Equipment</p>
<p>Le Ren Hospital, founded by Dr. Yin Le Ren, has been making progress in recent years and is deeply respected by all walks of life in Shanghai. Its medical equipment can be said to be all-encompassing, and it has specially invited famous doctors in Shanghai to jointly provide consultations. Those who have been brought back to health are countless. The hospital is located at No. 70 Gu Ba Road, French Concession (accessible by buses No. 2, 9, and 14 on Fu Xu Road). The transportation is convenient, and it is quiet in the midst of the bustling city. There is no noise of traffic and horses disturbing the peace when staying in the hospital for recuperation. The interior is a three-story garden house with fresh air. There were originally dozens of large and small wards, but recently they have not been enough to accommodate patients, so more than ten new ones have been added. The temperature is adjusted appropriately, and the nursing is attentive. The low cost is secondary. Dr. Yin's ambition to make progress grows day by day, always thinking of the patients and not focusing on profit. It is heard that at the beginning of the year, the hospital has hired doctors and nurses to expand equipment, and has improved the operating room, X-ray, etc., all moving forward. People like Dr. Yin can be said to have both a benevolent heart and medical skills, worthy of the name. Therefore, I am happy to record it, so that patients know where to seek medical treatment.</p>

<h3>My Forever Home</h3>
<p>— Er Wei</p>
<p>I finished reading Ms. Nan Ren's "It's Hard to Be a Woman" with tearful eyes. Is a woman really an unlucky thing? Indeed, this is something I cannot agree with.</p>
<p>Although I am also a girl from a middle-class family, in that year when I was eighteen and in the second year of junior high school, my father gave the priority of schooling to my brother. "Even if a woman graduates from university, her adherence to the three obediences and four virtues is not necessarily better than that of an illiterate woman. It saves her from developing fancy ideas with too much knowledge." He, who grew up in the old social system, often used such words to teach me.</p>
<p>"Why can't women be the same as men, studying and working? Aren't women human too?" I once retorted him with this rhetorical question.</p>
<p>"You women are incompetent. Don't you see that women all rely on men to live?" My rebuttal aroused his brilliant insight.</p>
<p>My school life came to an end. I couldn't blame my parents' orders, I could only hate the old social system and my fate. I maintained my lonely life with tears, helping my mother with some housework and learning a little of the so-called "rules" that women should understand. It was not bad, and I lived peacefully for a few months, but who knew that a heartbreaking thing would come head-on again. My father took the red invitation card and ordered my mother: "Wei'er is not young anymore, and the Zhang family has been urging her to marry. According to the fortune teller, the twentieth of next month is an auspicious day..." These words blew in the wind, as if stabbing my heart with needles. I was surrounded by tears again at this time. Coincidentally, my mother also walked in, and seeing my embarrassed appearance, comforted me in an unnatural tone, "Wei'er! Anyway, women have to get married when they grow up, so you don't have to be sad, maybe life over there will be a little better." She also cried.</p>
<p>Later, whenever I was lonely and sad, I would use my mother's words to warm my heart. Although I knew that these words could not become a reality, I also held a heart full of hope, fantasizing about that happy realm, and the comfort of a husband I had never met, and I felt slightly relieved.</p>
<p>Time passed so quickly, and I finally left the embrace of my loving mother who truly loved me, and entered this so-called permanent home that was even drier than the desert. I received some lessons from the women of the household, listened to some things I didn't want to hear, did some things I didn't want to do; I received countless cold looks, and the sin of my husband's merciless love. My previous dreams have now been completely shattered. What can I do to save myself? I can only obey the manipulation of fate. Who told you to be born a woman? I cursed myself again.</p>
<p>I remember once, because I had a severe headache and didn't leave the house, I was naturally scolded by the women of the household, and it happened that my father came back with rice. He vented his anger on me again, "Pretending to be sick all day long, rice is ninety yuan a picul, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't know how early you would have starved to death! Useless and lowly thing!"</p>
<p>"Are women really incompetent? Are they really unlucky things?" I asked myself, and finally couldn't find a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>Sisters, for the sake of our future younger sisters, we must tear down this decadent old social system!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, in this world, how many people can foresee everything in the future?</p>
<p>On the morning of July 3rd, the Girls' Normal School's fifth anniversary celebration was finally held in an old auditorium; the weather was very gloomy, as if God also knew that a pure girl was going to encounter misfortune at this gathering. Gray-black clouds covered the sky, and a good morning became like evening.</p>
<p>As usual, there were only a few local officials and gentry among the guests, and including the students' parents, there were only thirty or forty people. In the blink of an eye, the clock had struck nine, and the students and early guests all walked into the auditorium, but Principal Hou was still waiting anxiously under the corridor outside the reception room. Because in this ceremony, Military Governor Hu and the Provincial Governor were both indispensable idols, and they had both promised to arrive in advance, but now, apart from the Provincial Governor, who had already arrived with Director Ma of the Education Department, Military Governor Hu was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>"Principal Hou, it's almost 9:15 now, should we start the meeting first?" Dean Hong of the Academic Affairs Office came to her and asked quietly.</p>
<p>Principal Hou, who hunched over her shoulders all year round, her eyebrows deeply furrowed, and her face without a trace of a smile, now looked even more melancholy; coupled with the cloudy and rainless sky above, it would really make people immediately imagine that a tragedy was about to unfold here.</p>
<p>She wrung her ten bird-claw-like fingers together without feeling, unable to answer Dean Hong's inquiry, because starting the meeting before Military Governor Hu arrived would undoubtedly displease him; but letting Governor Wang and Director Ma of the Education Department and other people sit here waiting was also somewhat unreasonable, which made it difficult for her!</p>
<p>"Alas! There's really no way to deal with these people!" She lowered her head and sighed.</p>
<p>Until more than twenty minutes had passed, and Dean Hong of the Academic Affairs Office had come to urge her four or five times, Principal Hou was so anxious that she was about to faint—just like thirty years ago when she was in her hometown, waiting every day for her fiancé to escape from the Boxers, but never received any news. —A sound of leather shoes came from the air, and then the old gatekeeper, panting like a cow, led in seven or eight fully armed guys.

<h3>On Freedom</h3>
<p>— Shen Fu</p>
<p>A person without sufficient self-control cannot be considered free.</p>
<p>Expressing one's own thoughts is everyone's right to freedom.</p>
<p>Whoever loses their freedom has nothing left to lose.</p>
<p>A magnificent palace is a prison for someone who is always confined within it.</p>
<p>In a free country, there is little suffering, but more complaints; under tyranny, there is much suffering, but few complaints. (Translated from Parade)</p>

<p>Entertainment</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>Skylark</h3>
<p>— Cheng Bingnu</p>
<p>Ge Luliqi'an is a child star whom Universal Pictures is preparing to heavily promote, because Diana Bao Ping has reached the stage of acting in adult dramas. Strictly speaking, Qi'an's singing voice and face cannot match Bao Ping's. But she is young and intelligent, and given time, she may be able to replace Bao Ping.</p>
<p>This is probably the reason for "Skylark" after "Nightingale in the Valley." The story of "Skylark" must have been imagined for Qi'an, writing about a granddaughter in a large family who is discovered to have a singing talent and is invited to broadcast on the radio, but her grandfather firmly opposes it. After some twists and turns, she finally achieves her goal, and the granddaughter becomes very popular. But such a simple plot may make the audience feel monotonous, so as the advertisement says, "Uncles and aunts galore, sisters wholeheartedly talk about love," making the script lively.</p>
<p>Indeed, "Skylark" is lively enough, and liveliness is its biggest feature. In addition to Qi'an, the other supporting roles, such as Luo Bo Shi Danke, Xu Hebo, Ao Biao Lai Shi Misi, Nan Ge Lei, etc., can be said to be all top choices. It is good that everyone has a role to play, and it is not as nonsensical as other American films. This is the lovely thing about Qiu Pai Situo Nake, the producer of "Skylark." In terms of good aspects, there is also the distinct personality of each character, such as the grandfather's irritability, the elder sister's affection, and the father's confusion, all of which are vividly portrayed. The two little rascals - Pu Di, who first showed their talents in "Nightingale in the Valley," are also playfully cute here. These two guys will become comedy stars in the future. As for Qi'an's acting skills, they are not particularly outstanding, but very balanced. Her singing is not yet up to Bao Ping's level.</p>
<p>After watching "Skylark," the first impression is that it is lively and interesting, but this liveliness and interestingness will no longer exist when you leave the theater, because its plot is almost supported by these liveliness.</p>
<p>United Harmonica Team Broadcast</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Harmonica Team has been invited by XCDM Democratic Radio to broadcast a special program on January 8th at 5:00 PM at the radio station. Enthusiasts can turn on the radio at that time, and the frequency is 1440. Also, after the first batch of "The Wandering Songstress" interlude, which was distributed to harmonica enthusiasts from all walks of life by the team, was finished, it has now been reprinted and distributed again at the request of the case takers. Those who have not requested it can send two cents of postage to No. 513, Lane 13, Hankou Road to the team.</p>
<h3>"Escape" Not Shown in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Hui Lin</p>
<p>MGM's Anti-Nazi Film</p>
<p>MGM's anti-Nazi film "Escape," it is said that after being transported to Shanghai and screened, there is no hope of being shown. This novel alone has sold 210,000 copies in the United States, and along with "Gone with the Wind" (i.e. "Gone with the Wind"), is considered one of the best-selling books.</p>
<p>The film adaptation of "Escape" is Robert Taylor and Norma Shearer's first collaboration, with Hedy Lamarr, Philip Dorn, and Conrad Veidt in supporting roles. Its story is about an American young artist who goes through all kinds of hardships to rescue his mother who is detained in a concentration camp, interspersed with characters such as a countess, a general, and a prison doctor.</p>
<p>Robert Taylor plays the artist, probably still in the same style as "Waterloo Bridge." Norma Shearer has not been seen since "The Women," and she will not disappoint here either.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that Philip Dorn, who plays the role of the prison doctor, is very funny - he is a performer from the Netherlands who could not speak English when he came to Hollywood ten months ago, but he watched three or four films every day, guided by an English teacher, so now he can speak very prepared English. Philip Dorn's face does look a bit like Paul Muni (see picture). As for Hedy Lamarr, who plays the mother, is a famous star from the silent film era twenty years ago. "Escape" is her first work after returning to the screen, but unfortunately, her age has limited her development.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, fans who have seen "Man Hunt" will now have no chance to see this "Escape."</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Shou Yan</p>
<p>The second work of Hong Kong's Xinsheng Company, "Love of the Motherland," written and directed by Situ Huimin, has begun filming. Cai Chusheng's "New Life," after being revised, has also been completed and will begin filming after "Love of the Motherland." It is heard that Cai is also directing a Cantonese film for Daguan Company, called "Little Tiger." It is expected that after completion, the results will be able to surpass last year's first Cantonese film "Little Canton."</p>
<p>He Feiguang's "Light of East Asia" was honorably screened at the Chongqing Guotai Theater on New Year's Eve. The "Friendly Country Comrades" who participated in the film's personal appearances that evening also wore the badge of the Chinese Manufacturing Plant and attended with smiling faces, frequently nodding to the audience as a courtesy.</p>
<p>Zhu Shuhong, a photographer from "China," was filming a documentary in Ye Guang La Wu and other places when he was injured in a car accident, and the equipment was also damaged.</p>
<p>After writing "The Great Hero Gan Fengchi," Pei Chong's interest in improving Peking Opera has greatly increased, and he is now working on "Rouge and Gold Lance," which may be performed by the Xinyi Society Peking Opera Troupe in the future.</p>
<p>"The Chinese Robin Hood" will be completed around February 15.</p>
<h3>Sea Swallow</h3>
<p>— Ning Jing</p>
<p>Sea Swallow, this little girl's name seems a bit unfamiliar, but anyone who has seen her plays or knows her cannot deny that she is a talented actor.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the fourth of this month, she performed at the Nanyang Drama Society, where she played Shu Zhen in "Pretending to Be Affluent," and achieved excellent results, vividly portraying a little girl who is obsessed with modern fashion. Although her posture is like that of a modern lady, charming and graceful, what is worth admiring here is her pair of pupils full of childishness and her cute little mouth, which show a little girl who has not completely shed her childishness, so her greatest success lies here. She is a smart child, and I hope she will put in more effort herself.</p>

<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Xuezheng of Putian</p>
<p>Opening Method, Game Seventy-Three, Black First</p>
<p>This game is a tactic of setting up the cannon after advancing the pawn on the left (Black first)</p>
<p>Explanation: Black's chariot advancing one space first is to prevent Red from deploying the horizontal chariot first. Red's cannon moving to the first file is an important move to open the chariot path. When Red’s chariot moves to the seventh file to capture the horse, it is a safe move for Black’s chariot to move to the sixth file and then advance one or two spaces to confront the cannon; therefore, after Black moves the chariot from the sixth to the fifth file, Red should move the elephant from the third to the fifth file, which is the correct move; if Red moves it to the seventh to the fifth, it will definitely result in the loss of initiative and the loss of the elephant. Afterwards, both sides are balanced. At this point, the formation will eventually be drawn.</p>
<p>Announcement: There were many responses to Mr. Xue Weihan's solicitation of answers to the "Reaching for the Moon in the Water" game. Due to time constraints, I was unable to review them all at once, so the disclosure will be postponed by one week. Also, please do not send out any more responses this week.</p>
