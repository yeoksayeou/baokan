<p>中國事件</p>
<p>按日本以前數內閣、亦嘗宣布擬早日結束中國事件、近衛內閣且圖以政治與經濟方法吿成之、同時以全力改組日本自己之政治與經濟機構、但終吿失敗、則東條所言決計早日結束中國事件、其效果亦可知矣、此次日議會之開特別會議、其主要目的、乃在通過對華戰爭特別豫算案、目下之四十八萬萬元豫算案、僅足維持日軍在華之現狀、日政府因欲作新軍事行動、故必須請議會</p>

<h3>遠東反侵略陣綫</h3>
<p>近來因爲日本向外大規模侵略的可能性很大，所以ABCDR陣綫的團結，也就空前加强起來了。現在大家都看得很淸楚，假定遠東沒有這個陣錢存在，日本的北進或南進，也許早已就成了事實，亦未可知。可是正因爲對於這個陣綫的結成，東方暴力者是抱着無限畏懼的綠故，所以牠時時在尋求罅隙，企圖各個擊破，突出重圍，形成了現在待機出擊的威脅狀態。ABCDR集團力面對於這個形勢的唯一解答，祗有加强本身的團結與合作，以壓倒的力量，制止侵略勢力更進一步的冒險，以密切的合作與援助，促進共同總勝利的及早到求。吾則，萬一某一點或某一方面出現相當空隙與衰弱的話，那末，侵略者的趁機有所行動，當然是應有的事，而太平洋上烽火的掀起，也就成了必然的推論了。</p>
<p>ABCDR陣錢的事實結成，到今天，已經一再爲各國權威當局們所强調。牠的存在，已經爲所有觀察家們所一致認定的了。可是在形式上，牠並沒經過締盟的手續與文件，而在產生過程上，也完全是一個循着漸進程序的歷史產物，並不像德·日。義三國同盟似的，突然以一紙條文，宣佈牠們之間的同盟關係於世界。根本追溯起來，牠的產生，完全是由於德·義·日三國同盟局勢所逐漸造成。所以牠的精神，實在是普及到全世界的所有反侵略國家，而在運用上，也並不發生東西兩組分別看待的問題。然而，因爲地理與牠產生的歷史背景關係，牠今天適用的最大對象，顯然還是偏重於遠東，這是一；而允其在日本高唱南進與北進，和所有ABCDR各國同時爲敵的情形下，那未，牠們不得不一致團結起來，共謀抵制日本，也是當然的事，這是二。不過，日本方面所謂ABCDR集團的最大目的，是在於包圍日本的說法，却完全與實際不符而且衝突的。牠們所包圍的對象，是侵略行動，是所謂大束亞新秩序，及產生這一類行動與政策的狂暴精神與心理，而並不以某一個特定的國家爲限。關於這，祗要對於這個陣綫中各國參加的經過略一檢討，那末，我們立刻就可以明瞭了。</p>
<p>首先說中國。由於牠四年堅强苦戰的結果，又由於地理位置的特別重要，毫無疑義的，牠是這集團中最大的支柱。可是在中國作戰的初期，甚至在德，義，日去年九月正式締盟之前，中國的外交政策，一直是循着非當謹愼的途徑。在積極方面，牠避免與任何親善的友邦之間，發生類似同盟的關係，以致把自己牽入其他國際糾紛的漩渦，僅僅高呼着，凡是援助中國作戰及不妨碍中國奮戰的，皆是中國的好友。在消極方面，牠也竭力不開罪於任何與日本互作呼應的國家。可是這個基本立塲，於去年德·義·日三國正式締盟而互相承認對方所謂「新秩序」時，受了一個很大的搖動。今年春天以來的德，義，日三國互相結納企圖妨碍英。美對中國的接濟，又令中國當局有了進一步的信念，於是在郭外長回國就任的前夜，他在倫敦就第一决指出了ABC三國完全合作的必要。德·蘇爭爆發後，ABCDR集團結成條件完全成熟時，德，義却突然承認了日本侵略行爲所造下的成果，及蔑視中國合法主權的存在，這就促成了中國完全加盟的步驟。而從最近中國最高當局等表示裏，更可以知道，中國現在是完全站在這一個陣錢上，從事堅決的奮鬥。</p>
<p>其次是英美。一直到去年七月英國應允日本封鎖滇緬公路三個月的時侯，牠的外交基本方針，還是停滯在對東西兩組侵略者分別看待的階段之上。德·義·日正式締盟，分進合作建立新秩序，牠方突然覺醒過來，知道自己却同時正是兩方面的對象之一。今年春初及五月間，日本兩决響應德·義攻勢在東方有所動作的醞釀，使英國知道，牠在遠東的採取最堅決立場和牠在歐洲的作戰，對於牠帝國生存，是同等重要的。德·蘇戰爆發以來，英·蘇立卽締了盟，因而日本無論南進或北進，皆要與英國正面衝突。加之美國方面，一年來，已經由援助中。英的立塲，一進而爲援助中·英·蘇三國；由第三者的援助恣態，進到現在這不惜一戰的精神。種種，就使英·美兩國在這個陣綫裏地位，爲之完全確定。</p>
<p>再次是蘇聯。一直到最近，我們還沒有聽到牠對於這個陣綫的表示。不過，在國際關係上，牠與英國是同盟，對中國則是四年來共患難最可靠的友邦；而在過去紀錄上，牠曾先後有過張鼓峯。諾蒙亨等幾决的光榮戰績。蘇聯是重行動不尙空言的國家，所以對於牠在這陣錢裏的立塲，當然毫無疑問的。</p>
<p>最後加上態度非常明決的荷印，於是，這就搆成了遠東今天ABCDR的堅强陣錢。</p>

<h3>羅斯福邱吉爾　大西洋會見始末（三）</h3>
<p>在我們遇見護航隊那天的淸晨，爾斯親王一號曾由首相一行參觀高射砲實彈演習。首先發射一顆烟彈，在高空中爆發，化成一團黑烟，然後把它當作目標，開放高射砲，烟圍的四周一時便一棵棵開花彈。最後艦上所有高射砲一齊開放阻隔砲火。戰鬥艦的兩舷，似乎不斷在火熖中，火力之强，使艦身周圍的空中，盡被濃烟迷黑。一艘兵艦竟能發射如此厲　的阻隔砲火，實難令人相信。</p>
<p>邱吉爾在蘇格蘭某港登岸，即乘夜車遄返倫敦，翌晨駛入車站時，月臺上已擁塞着數百位歡迎的文武官員。邱吉爾滾圓的身體步出專車時，月臺上的人齊齊歡呼。</p>
<p>邱吉爾夫人急急走下月臺。掌壐大臣阿德里，樞密大臣安德森，一瘦一胖，緊跟在後面。邱吉爾齒露憨笑，注視他們走近，於是把她抱一滿懷，行個接吻禮。</p>
<p>邱吉爾回到唐寗街相府，立即召集戰時內閣特別會議，向各閣員詳細報吿，然後驅車前往白金漢宮，觀見國王喬治六世，奏呈羅斯福總統的復書</p>
<p>兩天之後，邱吉爾便向國內外廣播，報吿這决海上會議情形，叫十年來，他公開演說，鮮有比這决更加酣暢流利的。他劈頭就很自信地說道：「我想諸位必定希望我報告一些關於我此决遠涉重洋和我們偉大的朋友美國大總統會面的情形吧……在一個廣闊和四面是陸的海灣中，强大的美國戰鬥艦隊，在許多小型艦和長飛飛機保護之下，等候我們臨蒞，並好像伸手接引我們進去一般……</p>
<p>「我和羅斯福總統在那裏親熱的盤桓了三天，同時，英美兩國參謀長和海陸軍司令官隨坐一旁，共同舉行會議。「總統和我在海上舉行會議的時候，存着一種見解，就是不欲規定一種正式的和最後的和平方針或作戰目標，但必需製定一個扼要的戰時宣言，作爲英美兩國今後作戰的準繩。（未完）</p>

<p>工部局米出售、仍是零零落落、各米店店絕少見出售工部局米紙招、昨晨自愛文義路卡德路經成都路福煦路白爾部路霞飛路呂班路直達辣斐德路、只見兩家出售工部局米、一在愛文義路廣仁里口、一在福煦路白爾部路口、兩處糴米的人、都是人頭擁擠、前胸後背、緊靠緊、緊壓得大有氣喘不過來、白爾部路兄弟理髮店前在八時半左右、羅米行列中有中老年人二、婦孺三、經前後兩面之人夾攻、竟會從行列中擠跌出來、同倒於地、强有力者即已乘機加入、此五人東鑽西鑽、不少功夫、始得重行挨入行列中、亦有行列在前的人、被後來的强自其中拖出、占踞其位置、被拉出者欲再入、反遭毆打、直至十一時左右、米店早已停手、而守候在人行道待糴者、據各人襖上堊筆所書之數宇、尙有五百數十人、飢腸轆轆、而飯米猶在米店中、米店又在休息中、及回至愛文義路、正見米店將港米售完之紙招掛出、而立在鐵絲欄內之待糴人、猶迤邐至廣仁里內、想人生到此等地步、方知吃飯最是困難一件事、無非貪圖局米稍便宜、想不到局米也難得、一般薪工階級欲思購買那裹經得起這種待遇、米店爲了要出賣自己的米、故對於局米採取車輪戰術、不然、何以經過此長距離路程、只有兩家出售、然而亦可見局米之供給程度、當塲有幾句打油詩爲證、詩曰</p>
<p>欲糴升斗米　晨曦早起身</p>
<p>誰知日近午　依舊釜空鳴</p>
<p>所喜工部局平價洋米、仍在不斷而來、太古公司太原輪、昨午抵滬、由香港運來洋米一萬零二百包、又重慶輪昨日下午到埠、亦由香港裝來洋米一萬零二百包、停靠法租界本行碼頭起卸、該兩輪合計運來二萬零四百包、均係工部局之平價小絞米又重慶輪另有洋米二千四百包、定日內原船運往天津、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米市况、略見緩和、因黃金回落、客囤不復如日來之急切貪辦、且市塲中經工部局監察後、米業同業方面亦復一再諄勸、一部份投機份子已稍歛跡、浮多散戶略有回出、所以早市一度扳抬之後、旋即逐步回平、小絞現米最高曾有一百七十四五元、後即平至一百七十二三元、英華司小絞曾開二百〇六元之高價、後亦乏人接受、惟仍有少數市儈意圖扳抬、故市氣雖平、而行情仍見混亂也、全市成交現米一萬多包、英華司五六百噸、市儈之圖喊高、卒難實現、若一號西貢旣以價貴繼無成交、而一般中段貨無多變化、當中市開出、冲一號暹邏一百八十一元至一百八十元、二號一百七十三四元、小絞一百七十三四元、碎尖一百四十四元、二號西貢一百八十一二元、敏黨高自一百九十元次至一百八十五元、但後買氣不振、轉輾呈垂軟之色、結果收盤小絞巳僅一百七十一二元至百七十元、外棧一百六十八九元、比之前市計落二三元不等、</p>
<p>厚薄粳到貨共祇二三百石、故早市貨主售意頗堅、扳喊殊力、當開出崑山新粳二百零七元、靑角窰種二百零五六元、南港早破二百零五六元、又增五六元之巨、惟後市因見洋米不擴、去路懈淡、即亦回軟、故結果南港早破爲二百零四元、次至二百零二元五角、崑山新粳二百零四元、次至二百元、靑角窰種二百零二三元、實增二三元而已、而四涇野稻以貨稀猶緊續售二百零五六元、崑山新杜尖到有六七十石開一百九十一元至一百九十元零五角、</p>
<p>糯米自前一朝無交易、昨日去路頓較轉廣、惟提屬意於港元、故港元竟開至二百十一二元、特別二百十四五元、比週前飛騰十來元、糯茶亦開至一百九十一二元、至於國糯未見開出、</p>
<h3>金龍牌洋粉　六十元無受主</h3>
<p>昨糧公會繼續停市、洋粉交易仍乏正式交易、惟金落米平、塲外空氣亦復緩和、前日金龍牌六十元之價、尙乏人售出、而昨日雖喊六十元而乏受主矣、麩皮缺貨原係行國恃爲居奇者、昨小包麩皮又大一二元、開至五十七元半、</p>
<h3>傅有巨額金條運到　金價慘跌　一千八百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市、慘烈在跌、價已退近二萬元大關邊、各方人心大虛、市價始終在賣勢壓力中、傳因天津與南京有巨額金條運抵、委證券幫與某金號先後傾售之故、自晨初即見某錢莊首出十兩、價爲二萬二千一百五十元、的做低三百五十元、證券號繼售予兩金號各十兩、爲二萬二千一百元、某銀樓跟隨銀號步喊低求售、證券號（代津幫）現金號亦賣、午刻跌至二萬一千四百元、正午二萬一千五百元、下午小錢莊首出十兩、爲二萬一千三百五十元、低一百五十元、某金號（代南京幫）與證券號再爭出、現金號亦賣、又降八百五十元、最低兩金號互做十兩、爲二萬五百元、某銀樓少納、業外某戶來進、四點回升至二萬零七百元、比前日最後價竟在跌一千八百元、當日高低的一千六百五十元成交轉旺、金號本牌金門市售價二萬一千元左右、收進約二萬元、</p>
<p>飾金掛小一百三十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行上午掛小三十元、爲二千二百二十兀、下午連掛小二次、共再跌一百元、爲二千一百二十元、（收進的二千元左右）、軋小一百三十元、至紋銀大同行及新同行均不掛脾、詢及據謂仍每兩二十二元、各種飾物之打工竟加百分之二百五十、並聞一般業外奸商、竟做暗市、每兩抬高至三十三四元云、</p>
<h3>英匯再見貴價　後市始回　美鈔進四十元關</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、中央及滙豐兩掛牌均未更、匯豐小櫃檯價亦平、英美匯黑黑市先緊後小回、乃近日糖洋行因到貨四起扒結、旣扒英金一便士七五空前貴價、再扒美金二元六二五、均由某實業家絲商售出、後有平準會有本月期將增加正當商業結匯額、扒風始息、午刻轉形硬化、下午英金二便士、及美金三元、始有買戶、價與上日晚收相彷彿、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨現金價下落十元、英金票則有需要頭寸、市價漲起三元、美金票上午又曾昂至四十一元、但旋即步落、午後退爲三十九元八角、比上日計跌七角、香港票仍不乏需要、市價續漲二角、日金票及朝鮮票漲勢益熾、前者高至三元九角三分、後者升爲三元七角、</p>
<h3>期紗加一百元　結價軋平　雙馬廠單再見高價</h3>
<p>紗市績見上挺、氣勢依然緊昂、此因原料日升、致人心看好爲多、二十支雙馬廠單晨開爲三千一百十元、但叢集於市塲之人、一致想進、所以情况仍舊熱烈、一鬨即漲至三千二百三十元之新紀錄、繼以盈利稍吐、續鬆至三千一百五十五元、惟便格回低後、買氣復熾、又升至三千一百九十元、收盤價叉三千一百八十五元、市塲成交較爲起色、</p>
<p>現紗情況、初堅績漲、　後回平、但買戶仍數與奮、因之售價盤盤向上、查購買之意、皆爲原料日漲、廠方成本有關、所以囤收之念尙濃也、查現紗粗細市價一致要升七·八·十元之鉅、成交的六百包光景、怡和廠開出胭脂虎數十包、價爲二千一百五十元、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、爲顧全市價狂騰、乃經公會議決暫行結價、近遠均升一百元爲結價標準、多空雙方軋平、十一月份以二六四八元結價、十二月以二七零四元結價、一月份以二七五八元結價云、</p>
<h3>籍口來源不旺　現棉漲勢仍强</h3>
<p>現棉情況、漲風銳不可當、然金價已回小、但人心仍不肯下鬆、多說來貨不旺、所以粗細棉價續漲十元至二十元、然其交易、則異常淸淡、茲將做開價格列左、</p>

<h3>砂糖雖源源到來　食糖投機白熱化　昨市仍告漲庭扳</h3>
<p>昨糖市漲勢依然銳厲、期組上下午仍吿停板、可見投機在熱方興未艾也、公司期貨二四粗白上午初市尙平、十一月十日開三百三十元、旋即跳至五十三元、二十日期開三百六十元、旋至六十五元，均吿停板、下午十日期開三百六十元、繼至七十三元、二十日期開三首八十四元至五元、遂吿停板、均升四十元、現貨二四粗白十月份到貨三百四十五元·六十元·六十二元、下午六十四元至七十七元、後轉平爲充十六元、尙升十元、九月份三百四十三元至六十元、下午六十四元至七十六元、後爲五十五元、升十一元、八月份三百四十八元至五十八元、下午六十元·七十五元·五十六元、荷赤三百零五元至十二元、下午二十二元至十五元、升十七元、杳港粗白三百十六元·三十二元、下午四十元·四十八元、升三十二元、太古車白B嘜三百四十元·六十元·七十元、升二十五元、DY嘜三百三十四元。五十元、升二十元、HX嘜三百二十二元·三十元、下午四十元至五十元、統共成交期貨五千餘包、現貨三萬八千餘包、</p>
<p>砂糖昨日太原輪裝來又有九千四百二十五包、重慶輪亦由香港裝來砂糖三千包、昨日共到砂糖一萬二千四百二十五包、但不足以制滬糖市之屯積、（祖）</p>
<h3>公債較爲堅定　外股亦呈活躍</h3>
<p>公</p>
<p>債暗盤、昨市比較堅定、蓋以連跌二日之後、稍起回風、丙種兩度打破五元、終仍爲五元六角收盤、可見空方稍嫌擁擠、浮空抵補、價乃回上數角、但脚地終未見堅强耳、目下公債行市係受物價飛漲之影響、暫時得能穩定即可矣、昨日上午開盤、同康同順順泰均係買進、以潤德生大久豐一度湧瀉、丙種曾打破五元、旋即向上、午後鴻大順泰買進、散戶亦頗有需要、雖以胡鶴記怡泰賣出開盤祇四元九角、檯面已求過於供、曾抬至五元七角、形勢稍定、以後再看多空之進行方針耳、市價結果、一致升一角半至五角、威交計一百六十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交盟强铜閘北水電公司股五百股、價爲十九元五角、</p>

<h3>管理物價新附則　領事團已予核準　各種必須品價逐步管制　太古公司研究糖商拒售</h3>
<p>浦東運滬鹽斤遭限制鹽價被漁利</p>
<p>工部局前爲管理界內另售物價起見、曾向領事團請求批准地產章程之新附則項、以便着手擬们關於管理物價之現章、茲悉上項新附則、業經領事團正式核准、並經該局頒發布告、宣布新條文內容、茲錄其佈吿如下、</p>
<p>核準之新　附則條文</p>
<p>案准領袖領事函知、所擬地產章程「附則第五十三章　　按照該章程第十一條之規定、予以核准、新附則之條文如下、一個人·合夥·或公司、凡係制之任何物品者均應遵守工部局隨時刊布關於所存此項物品數量與存貯地點、應有記錄、或關於其出售價格之規則、任何個人·合夥·或公司、倘違犯工部局依照本附則而公布之規則內所載任何條款、應受（甲）地產章程第十七條所規定之懲罰、或主管法院認爲公允之其他處分、或（乙）由工部局將各該個人·合夥或公司所顧執照扣留或吊銷、或前項懲　與扣留或吊銷執照同時施行、」</p>
<p>領團表示　同情抑價</p>
<p>新附則中所定罰規、有依照地產章程第十七款者、查該款條文、爲「此後如有人違反本章程、經人報吿領事或由地方官通知領事者、該領事得於管轄權之內、直接傳喚該違章人到案、倘訊明屬實、即予處罰、或轉使處罰爲數小過三百兀之罰金、或爲期不過六個月之監禁、或酌用其他公允之辦法、倘違章之外僑在滬幷無該管領事、工部局得請由一國或數國之領事、向中國主要官廳起訴、以維持本章程之完全、而懲違章之人犯、」又領事　核准新附則所根據之地皮章程第上一款、乃規定工部局當道「有隨時另訂附則之權、幷得將附則取消、更改或修正、」衆信領團此决核准該項新附則、不僅格於規章所定、蓋領團方面、前曾表示界內騰漲之物價、必須抑止也、</p>
<p>管理細則　隨時佈告</p>
<p>據工部局某職昌稱、工部局將立即採取有效辦法、以行施新附則中所許管理物價之權力、因工部局事前在行政及法律手續方面、均已準備就緒也、至於一經工部局隨時布告應受物價統制之任　物品、」究係何指、該職員稱、將包括現已開始之洋米及將待開始之重要必需品如麵麥等　　其細則、均由工部局「隨時佈告一、他如「屬於伙食公司與藥房所售之物品、例如進口或就地制造之食物、調味品除污物料、藥品紙烟烟草肥皂及飲料等等」、亦將遵照此項　附則、彙同進口商及製造廠評定零售物價、予以合理之科潤、所定價格、倘經工部局核准、作爲最高價格、則不得超過、違者當援用新附則處罰、消息靈通人士相信、以上各種物品之最高價格、短期內均將評定、</p>
<p>局方規定　逐日會商</p>
<p>預料此後工部局、將隨時公佈零售物價、嚴令零售商人遵辦、工部局已自昨日起、每日上午、在會</p>
<p>室舉行會議一次、討論管理物價辦法、工部局官員如總辦費利溥·秘書皮斯萊等、今後將按日審核處理每日所發生之有關物價事項、昨日該局以數日前某報載、本市會有米一百萬包、及麵粉二百萬包、由早生輪裝運赴天津、以此說並非事實、若不糾正、則將被誤認本市食糧存底、業已减少、將刺激物價上漲、故巳囑令該局書報檢查處、函各報更正、並發表是日由阜生輪運津之確數、爲麵粉三萬零四白九十包、糖五十二百包、米八百包、</p>
<p>存糖頗多　鹽運受阻</p>
<p>最近工　局統制物價、進行不遺餘力、除對煤球麵粉等日用必需品、已早經決定外、而對食糖項、聞亦將實行統制、探息、截至目下爲止、本市在各堆棧內斯藏有之食糖存底、足敷一年半之用、况目下食糖來源甚暢、自荷印等處均有大量運到、預料一俟工部局籌有統制辦法後，糖價可望大跌、</p>
<p>糖商拒售</p>
<p>本市市民、現頗以未能購得食糖爲苦、其能購得者、售價之昂、打破紀錄、且有漲無已、記者今（四日）晨曾與主要批發店六家接觸、其中五家俱以糖已售盡爲言、餘一家亦謂已售至最後一袋、其價十磅裝達二十八元之巨、惟擴承銷太古糖之　商太古公司某負責人員聲稱、邇來上海進口之糖頗正常、而太古公司供給零售店之糖、亦未减少、此外、本市且囤有塊糖數萬包、零售店若不售糖、實無託詞、</p>
<p>儘可報告</p>
<p>公衆凡向某號購糖而不得者、應報吿太古公司、俾調查此等店號之糖、是否向太古公司採辦、如果確向太古採購、則該公司當取有建設性之步驟、以資對付云、該員續稱、近有太古之船一艘、在駛滬途中稍受損害、此或爲發生糖荒謠諑之可能的原因、若干店號、非向太古公司直接購糖、但係向居間人採辦者、存糖或其已减少、然以一般而言、上海之糖頗充、若以缺糖爲言、停售食糖、實不成其爲藉口云、惟近來各種物價之高漲、如瘋似在、某伙食店之綫麪價、於昨晨八時至十一時之間、劇漲一倍、</p>
<p>鹽又漲價</p>
<p>日來本市鹽價飛漲、雖非囤積所致、然零售店必有乘機漁利者、近年兩租界華籍居民所用之鹽、大半購自浦東鄕婦、謠傳此輩鄉婦、近因浦東方面施限制之故、未能私運食鹽入租界販賣、數日前、市民尙能從此葷鹽販購得每元一斤四兩之鹽、惟近日來不常可得、零售店遂乘機抬高鹽價、致市民以合理的代價購取日用必需品時、又遇一新的困難、</p>
<h3>煤屑十萬噸　卽將啓運</h3>
<p>航業界消息、本市各大煤公司於上月初成交煤斤約達十五萬噸以上、現已於產區分別裝輪者的達十萬噸左右、並於日內即可啓運、如無變故、本月中旬可先後抵埠、據悉該項煤斤、泰半係製造煤球所需之煤屑，惟此種煤屑、皆係木市各大煤公司所訂購、又據煤業界方面消息、製造煤球所需之煤屑、存儲本市者猶甚充實、前途決無匱乏之虞、同時、該項存煤屑、因係於半年前陸續購進者、其來價甚爲低廉、故本市各大機製煤球廠製造煤球成本、並未見增、</p>
<p>存煤數目　迄未公佈</p>
<p>存儲浦東虹口滬西暨法租界各大小堆棧存煤、刻仍豐厚如恒、但上海市煤業同業公會曾分函各會員同業將所有烟白存煤列表塡報該會、俾知悉存煤確切數額、該公會對該項調查工作、限於十月底前辦妥、顧截至咋日、猶未見該會對調查結果、向外公佈、但據熟請煤市者吿稱、本市各堆棧所有存煤、足够本市冬令需要、</p>
<h3>各國　檢查滬郵</h3>
<p>據上海郵政管理局消息、國際情勢趨緊張後、各國對進出郵遞、均實施檢查、除遠東香港新加坡馬尼刺緬甸等地實行已久外、近日由蘇聯英美日本等各地寄運到滬郵件、均曾被當地郵局開封檢查、其中尤以日本郵局檢查爲最苛嚴、外僑郵寄信件或包裹等、亦未能倖免、至有否郵件遭扣、則迄今尙未獲得報吿、</p>
<h3>南輪被扣後　向關抗議</h3>
<p>南斯拉夫貨輪湯密斯拉夫號輪長鮑佛利尼氏稱、渠巳於昨晨關於湯密斯拉夫號被扣一事、向江海關當局提致抗議、蓋該輪主權屬於南國、而渠所獲紐的船主來電、證實該輪並未轉讓任何方面、現輪上義水手雖已撤退、但來自康脫凡地輪上之高級官員三名、與水手三十名、仍未去、</p>
<h3>南洋商務考察圑　月杪啟程　政院撥助五萬元</h3>
<p>滬港工商界組織之南洋商務考察團、籌備業已就緒、並由經濟部呈准行政院補助經費五萬元、現該團巳推定王曉籟·林康侯、章叔淳·董仲偉·葉蘭泉·爲提名委員、審查團員資格、並團員人選、希望　括紡織·企業·貿易、及經濟各方專家、曁與印度貿易有密切關係者、出發日期準在本月底由港會集啟程、</p>
<h3>見利忘義　企圖囤寒衣</h3>
<p>本市物價、自不斷騰漲後、乃紛紛從事國積貨物（尤以日用品爲甚）、致使物價日益飛漲、乃最近竟有人因鑒於天時寒冷冬令衣着日漲、竟企圖大批收購各善團施送貧苦市民之寒衣、（如三敎道德善議會所製之寒衣、計重三斤三兩、售洋十三元若以現在市價比較、已須十七八元）擬整千收購、但爲該會發覺拒絕、爲杜流弊起見、特在施衣內外、加蓋三敎會會名及施衣字樣同時並分別通知全市各慈善團體、凡發售或贈送施衣者、萬勿爲所利用、而被大量收購、免致貧民寒衣、發生問題、</p>
<h3>當歸大黃准運至禁運區　限換購日用品內運　國藥要劑供給可無虞</h3>
<p>經濟部近電知上海市商會駐港辦事處云、本部現經考慮、以當歸大黃、西北各省產量極豐、若長期禁運、則內銷有限、勢必形成生產過剩、於農村經濟、不免發生影響、且查當歸大黃、同屬國藥要劑、因擬寓疏銷於禁運之中、暫定准許國內正常商人、購運當歸大黃至禁運區域銷售、換購日用必需品輸送後方、惟須先向當地商會申請函具保證、呈山核發准運執照、俟將換購物品運回、仍須報請地方主管官署查騐、並將執照繳銷、藉施管制、合行電仰知照、</p>

<p>五六百人</p>
<p>工資於今春增加至每工四元、全夜工工資同、夜點心五角、近日本市各物重復暴漲、故平民生計已不勝負担、該工人等亦因受物價狂漲之影響、日前提出向長順·聯鑫棧兩包工頭、要求增加工資、該棧係向太古公司承包、故工人加價、亦須向太古公司請求、因公司英人大寫患病醫院、一時不能解決、的定十日會商、但工人方面不允緩約、即於昨晨實行罷工、致法租界外灘太古各碼頭工作因之停頓、該碼頭靠有瓊州·濟南。太原·重慶各輪、正待裝卸貨物、公司方面乃責成兩棧包工、</p>

<h3>錢旭滄創新型球類運動　圓門球已試騐成功</h3>
<p>熔籃足球優點於一爐　即將舉行盛大表演賽</p>
<p>本市藍白籃球隊指導錢旭滄、平素提倡體育、不遺餘力、去歲曾推行中心球（Goal·Hi）等、允具熱忱、近錢君本其致力體育十餘年之經騐、首創一新型球類運動、定名曰圓門球、係擷取籃球足球二項運動之優點、幾經考慮設計、煞費苦心、現巳大吿成功、並在愛文義路國强中學建築球塲、開始作實騐運動、規則業已編印就緒、各界可具函向國强中學體育部索取、錢君定近期內作盛大之分開表演、以資喚起體育界人士之注意、預料此緊張熱烈之圓門球、必能風行一時、而爲我國體育界放一新彩也、該項比賽之概况如决、</p>
<p>游戲簡說</p>
<p>圓門球之球場、成長方形、較籃球塲略大、室內或室外均可、球塲之二端各豎立一圓門、塲上以白綫劃分邊綫、端錢、中錢、發球綫、及球門區域綫每隊比賽人數爲六人、（大型球塲之面積及比賽人數同足球）、其中一人任守門之職、其餘各人、可用手及膝部以上之肢體、用任何方式將球傳運拍擲、（惟守門員在球門區域內可用足）、以進入對方圓門爲目的、同時球員須嚴密防禦對方球員將球進入本隊圓門、</p>
<p>圓門意義</p>
<p>球門成有規則之圓角形、高二百十公分、闊三百六十公分、大小與小型球球門相埒、因球員以手擲球攻門易於瞄準、爲减少守門員防禦之困難及避免不可挽救之險球、以增加比賽進行之興趣起見、故球門兩角截成等半徑之半弧形、</p>
<p>比賽規則</p>
<p>圓門球之規則、係參考籃足球編纂而成、諸凡運球、拍球、擲球、傳球、跳球等動作、均與籃球類同、違例及犯規之規定、亦依籃球之成例、其罰則分擲　綫球、角球、球門球、及罰仟意球、六公尺球等、均與足球相近似、至於守門員與球門區域之規則、與足球稍異、其中尤以球員進人球門區域之限制於爲嚴密、球門區域成半圓形、於守門員外、不論任何球員進入或觸及球門區域綫者、概作犯規論、依章處罰、共餘規則、若比賽職員、比賽時問、開始比賽、暫定進行、比賽術語、勝負、違例、犯規、任意球、角球、六公尺球等、均巳於規則內專章釐訂、詳載無遺、</p>
<p>優良之點</p>
<p>圓門球之運動為　合籃球足球之規則　域、而比賽之動作、實較足球爲迅捷、較籃球爲簡單、全局無沉悶苦澀之階段、始終緊凑、興趣盎然、此其一也、攻守技術雖多變化、但極易學習、不似籃足球之投籃或射門、非經長時間之練習不可者、大有分別、故極易普及、此其二、動作快慢適度、無過於劇烈或過於緩弛之弊、對於身體各部分、有平均之發展、允適台於我國國民體格、此其三、綜上所觀圓門球實爲我國當前最理想之新型球類運動、各界愛好運動人士、曁體育專家定能樂爲推行以圖普及也、首創圓門球之錢旭滄君近影</p>

<p>我們在上海，聽慣了看惯了一般擁有游資的人，吃的穿的，非洋貨小辦，動輒耗費外滙，還有人乘外滙緊縮之時，投機囤積，還有人買進外滙，窖藏外幣，還有人摸索黑市，更有人趕所謂「黑黑市」，只顧私人獲利，不恤驅大部分平民於水深火熱之中，同爲國民，能無慨然。</p>
<p>我們懸想在王氏招待席上，豆腐乾與花生米並陳的時候，到會的外賓，將如何的對刻苦中的中華民族，致其敬意，決不致如上海茶室舞塲酒樓菜社中所表現的那樣頽廢，囂張驕奢，淫逸，在那裏作慢性的自殺。</p>
<p>生於憂患，死於安樂，凡是讀了這一則電訊的人，我想總應該有所感悟。况且在這個秋風正勁，轉瞬嚴冬的時候，一念及多少人在冰雪中爲大衆爭生存，多少人流離異鄉，期待着光明的來臨，受盡磨折，歷盡艱辛。而在上海恣意享受的人們，「朱門酒肉臭路有凍死骨」，稍有人心，也將痛自腿責。寒衣運動，助學運動，救濟婦女運動，這些作，在人們吃魚翅，嚼大菜的時候，如果能够一加轉念，定必食不下嚥，而自願以此種無謂耗費，移作救濟之用了。</p>
<h3>熟悉的隊伍</h3>
<p>— 方強</p>
<p>似乎是好久不見了——從米店門口排起的長蛇陳一。可是，這兩天來的情形，却比半年多以前更「熱鬧」了——從路的這一頭，直排到路的那一頭。中間經過着兩三百家的店面是不算什麼一回事的。而且，有的隊伍更會在另一條橫馬路上轉了彎，再連續下去。更有的，甚至在馬路的兩對面，都排上了這樣的「長蛇陣」。</p>
<p>於是，這一帶的店家，好像在門口臨時「戒嚴」了，要出去，就非得繞匕一個大圈子不可。允其，　着米店貼鄰的幾家，算是最「倒霉」的了。</p>
<p>巡捕們在忙碌着，警棍不住的在空中揚起，又落下了！</p>
<p>人的聲浪，從這裹傳播開去，傳到老遠老遠。它是混亂而嘲雜。每個人身上劃上一個白號碼。</p>
<p>米店櫃檯快到的刹那是最緊張的時候，每個交替着下來。的「蛇」，臉孔都漲得通紅</p>
<p>櫃檯裏的夥計們，汗在往米堆裏滴，但它却滲在米粒裏賣給了「長蛇陣」的「將士」。</p>
<p>吃飽了飯來擠的人們是有力的。可是等到買着米的時候，肚子是痛得可以的了。但是，不要緊，餓痛了，可以把擠到的米去燒飯吃。可是，吃飽了，明大又得來擠。這樣，人們的生活，時間，就全部的給米拿了去。</p>
<p>不過，也有等了兩天等不到一粒米的，那就只好去渴白開水了！</p>
<p>路上，有人在議論紛紛，說是「買工部局米，美擔一百十七元，却比從前買「平價米」更踴躍了！而且，這决糴米的人，顯然地，是比從前的隊伍高尙』了一等，衣着方面，也比從　整齊多胃！」</p>
<p>不錯，這是實在的情形。但，並不希奇，上决擠買平糶米的人，是早已去吃「珍珠米粉或「山薯」去了！這次「長蛇陣」裏換上了一批「將士」那是「進一步」的表現，我們感到「慶幸」！居然也化「精益求精」了！</p>
<p>誰說，這是「每况愈下」呢？</p>
<p>好在，我們這批人參加到「長蛇陣」裏去是應該的」！只要坐汽車的「老闆們再多囤一點，堆棧裏再多放一點就得了！</p>
<p>不過，我這裏奇怪的是，竟會讓這樣悽慘的情形不斷發展下去嗎？……我冉也不敢往下想了！</p>

<p>經過了幾句簡單的問話之後，當他看看我的履歷表：</p>
<p>「你從前是不是在××公司做事？」</p>
<p>「是的！我是在××公司當職員。」</p>
<p>「那末有多少薪水一月？』「連米貼和房金貼有××元一月。』我很謹愼的回答。</p>
<p>「那末你爲什麼辭去職務呢？」我竟想不到他會這樣的問我。</p>
<p>「紙因為……薪水……不够。』我說的時候，生硬得很，面上覺得很紅。心中猛然地跳着。但是「考試委員』老爺好像洞悉似的，很爽脆的說：「本店担保的方法是有二種：第一種担保你的店家須要存一萬元在我的店中，開一戶頭，作爲保證金：第二種本店需要更多的資本，請担保你的店家加入一萬元股份。」</p>
<p>我感覺到失望。我一顆熱淋淋的心，已經給冰冰住。一個窮小子那裏去找肯出一萬元作担保費的店家。最後他却給我一句鼓勵的話。。</p>
<p>「你的考試很圓滿，有錄取的可能，我希望你努力的去找尋舖保。」</p>
<p>我站起來向那位考試老爺點過頭之後，頭也不回地從人叢中擠出去。</p>

<h3>壽春壺齋曲話</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>香艷辛酸的玉堂春</p>
<p>玉堂春一劇，是明代事實。山西洪洞（此字陽平聲，讀如同）縣，有沈皮氏謀死親夫一案之卷宗，由明朝保留至今，即此案也。玉堂春本人是被皮氏栽誣，屈打成招。巡按御史王景隆，因平反而娶之，被參免官回鄕。此與俄國文豪托爾斯泰的復活說部情節相似。王景隆情願不做巡按，定要娶心上愛人，又與英國溫莎公爵的犧牲精神正同。這種事在世界人類的志行上，甚有趣味，玉堂春一戲，香艷中含有辛酸，所以一向受大衆歡迎。</p>
<p>往年名旦角來滬，多在第一日出演此劇，因爲此戲唱工繫重，好腔甚多，足見角兒本領，不惟賣座上大有把握，而角色上台穿紅衣，亦取個吉，意謂此角紅了也。今程硯秋來，聞其第一日將演玉堂春，早託人代購票位，不料過十天始輪到，票係早定，計時往觀，楊寶森之珠簾寨，正在與周德威對刀比箭，已成尾聲，不必批評。硯秋昔年以玉堂春拿手，其長處在字斟句酌，而聲音沉實，足以吐出哀怨之情。今因身體發胖，調門比前稍低，然共唱出之流利，猶非他人所及。吾聽其腔調，亦比前有些變化，陽平聲字，更多低出之音，（如人字，情字，門字，）似譚派老生全用湖廣音唱法，此種唱字法，乃硯秋所創，吾於此事，覺尙有研究之必要，今爲篇幅所限，暫不具論，硯秋扮像比往昔益增嫵媚，別具丯神，並不因肥胖而减其美，惟腰部似欠嬝婷彷彿是一變身子一不知何日始能輕鬆也。昔見宋人筆記有一條云，一人好道術，精修多年，已結聖胎，而未明化氣之法，仙人劉海蟾寄語，問其十月懷胎，如何產下，硯秋腹中，恐亦是修煉所結之聖胎耶？一笑！</p>
<p>近十餘年來，每見玉堂春會審一塲，高坐堂皇之三位大人，問答狀態，滑稽浮燥，如同兒戲，不像朝廷大員，直像三個說相聲者，近日益變本加厲，不成體統，吾每恨恨，今觀硯秋自帶之配角，顧珏蓀，張春彥等三人，分扮巡按，藩台，臬台，在玉堂春，唱中夾入問答之神氣，文靜規矩，語氣亦含而小露，値得宣揚贊　，今將大書之，以吿世人，凡好戲都被俗伶隨意改壞，修正之任，在於有識之士，戲劇　於通俗敎育至大，願社會知識階級，多加研究，而負起改良之責，一切劇，乃有光大之日。</p>

        <h1>1941.11.05</h1>
<h3>The Sino-Japanese War Remains Unresolved; Japan Unlikely to Invade Siberia; Japan Increases Troops in Vietnam, Aiming to Spy on Kunming, Yunnan Province; Elite Chinese Forces Move South to Defend the Burma Road</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to well-informed domestic and foreign sources, following the passage of the emergency military budget by the Japanese Diet on November 15th, Japanese troops in Shanxi Province are expected to cross the Yellow River and spy on Xi'an. Japanese troops in Vietnam are expected to move north to spy on Kunming, aiming to cut off China's main supply lines, namely the Burma Road and the Northwest Highway. Regardless of any changes in the Battle of Moscow, Japan will not invade Siberia due to two main reasons: (1) the level of mechanization of the Japanese army is far inferior to that of the Soviet Far East Army; (2) Japan needs 1.5 million troops for this campaign, but with the war against China still ongoing, Japan cannot mobilize this number. In addition, Japan's current financial position cannot sustain such a major campaign. At the same time, Japan does not dare to launch operations in the South Pacific due to the strong defenses of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, and does not want to risk war with Britain and the United States. Therefore, the only path Japan can take is to attempt to end the situation through military action.</p>
<p>China Incident</p>
<p>Previously, several Japanese cabinets had also announced their intention to end the China Incident as soon as possible. The Konoe cabinet even attempted to achieve this through political and economic means, while focusing all efforts on reorganizing Japan's own political and economic institutions. However, it ultimately failed. Therefore, the effect of Tojo's statement that he is determined to end the China Incident as soon as possible is predictable. The main purpose of this special session of the Japanese Diet is to pass a special budget for the war against China. The current budget of 4.8 billion yuan is only enough to maintain the status quo of the Japanese army in China. The Japanese government wants to take new military actions, so it must ask the Diet to</p>
<p>Continue to Allocate Military Funds. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Japanese government has convened special Diet sessions twice to pass special budgets for the invasion of Nanjing and Hankou. It is now believed that Japan will send at least eight divisions from Vietnam to invade Kunming. The number of Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam was originally 40,000, but has recently increased to 70,000. It is reported that reinforcements are still arriving in Vietnam from Hainan and Guangzhou. It is expected that when the strength of the Japanese army in Vietnam increases to 120,000 or 160,000, they will launch an</p>
<p>Attack on Kunming.</p>
<p>Between Lao Cai and Mengzi, there are continuous mountains and rapid currents, making it extremely difficult to use mechanized troops. However, the area north of Mengzi to Kunming is suitable for such troops. It is now believed that when the Japanese army attacks from northern Vietnam, they will mainly rely on aircraft for assistance. Since the Japanese army occupied Vietnam, elite Chinese troops have been stationed along the Yunnan-Guangxi border to prevent accidents. Reuters has learned that large numbers of Chinese reinforcements are now moving south to protect the Burma Road. Many well-informed observers here believe that the future Battle of Kunming is likely to be the most important battle of the Sino-Japanese War, or even the final major battle. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Chinese army here announced last night that the Japanese army has concentrated 80,000 troops in Vietnam, but it is not yet known whether they will advance south or</p>
<p>Invade Yunnan.</p>
<p>The spokesman said that the Japanese army authorities took over the French government and administrative organs in Hanoi on November 1st, and are still taking over other places. The Japanese army has also completed the occupation of all railway and highway areas in Vietnam. The Japanese army is now being transferred from Haiphong to Hanoi, and from Hainan to Saigon. An independent operational unit, including tanks, artillery, machine guns, and transportation units, is stationed in Lao Cai. Regarding the Japanese announcement of an attack north of Xinyang, Henan Province, the spokesman replied, "I believe this move is not</p>
<p>Particularly Important</p>
<p>because it is not a concerted attack launched westward from Zhengzhou, and only a small number of troops are currently participating in the attack." The spokesman also said that he had received reports that 20,000 Japanese troops were concentrated at Humen, between Hong Kong and Guangzhou on the Pearl River, apparently waiting for ships to be transferred elsewhere. The spokesman said that in the second half of October, the Japanese army's movements in Vietnam included the transfer of 10,000 troops from Saigon to Hanoi, and the transfer of an equal number of troops from Hainan to Haiphong.</p>
<p>Five Thousand Japanese Troops</p>
<p>were transferred to locations close to the Guangxi border, such as Lang Son and Cao Bang. The Japanese army is expanding the An Fei airfield southeast of Lao Cai, and adding machinery and equipment. 20,000 Japanese troops are stationed between Haiphong and Lao Cai, and are recruiting many farmers in the area to build roads. The spokesman also said that he had received reports that the Japanese were transferring troops to the Burmese border, facing the defenses prepared by the British army. The Japanese authorities have also taken over the French arsenal in Hanoi, which can produce 100 rifles, 2 machine guns, and 10,000 rounds of ammunition per day. (United Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Largely Surrounded in Areas Along the Old and New Yellow Rivers; Fierce Fighting North of Runan, Henan; Hand-to-Hand Combat Occurs in the Suburbs of Zhongmou</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Military news: (1) On the 3rd, part of the Japanese army invaded Runan City at noon and continued to advance north. After being intercepted by Chinese troops, fierce fighting broke out near Balipu (north of Runan). The number of Japanese troops advancing on China via Dushan Temple also increased to more than 1,500, but they were still stopped by Chinese troops in the Majiang (northeast of Queshan) area.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese army that retreated south from Zhengzhou and the old Rongze County area were fiercely pursued by two large Chinese armies. Except for a small part of the Japanese army that had crossed the river, most of the rest were stopped by Chinese troops in the area along the old and new Yellow Rivers. The Chinese troops pursued the Japanese aggressively in a pocket-like formation, and had already surrounded the Japanese forces separately. (3) The Japanese troops in the Zhongmou area were surrounded by Chinese troops in the nearby villages, and have been engaged in hand-to-hand combat since the evening of the 2nd. (4) The area near the Pipachen ferry southeast of Jingshui Town to Gangli has been completely cleared. (5) The Chinese troops that captured Jingshui Town pursued the Japanese army, and continued to capture Dongzhaoji at 3:00 PM on the 3rd. A group of 500-600 Japanese troops were surrounded by Chinese troops in the riverbank area northwest of Dongyueji. (6) The troops that captured the old Rongze County, including Dahu Village, Fanhe Village, and Bawangcheng, continued to attack the Japanese army fiercely, and had already completed a three-sided encirclement of the Japanese forces. The Chinese army repeatedly fought to seize various highlands such as Zhangjiao, Yaoming, Shanggou, and Wangjia. On the morning of the 4th, all strongholds were finally captured by the Chinese army. (7) Commander Harada, the commander of the division, and Yoshika, the commander of the 221st Regiment, were seriously injured in the battle to attack Zhengzhou. Commander Kotori has been reported to have been killed in a bombing raid. (Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Guerrilla Warfare Yields Considerable Results.</p>
<p>The Chinese troops from various units in Ji and Fen counties have launched extensive guerrilla warfare behind Japanese lines and have achieved considerable results. The Japanese army has been attacked by Chinese troops everywhere. The Japanese army is currently gathering more than 5,000 troops in an attempt to advance on Chinese positions. The Chinese troops have launched fierce attacks in sections, killing many Japanese soldiers. (Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>The Chinese army has made considerable progress in the Xingji and Hejin areas. The area near Lingshang has been completely cleared by the Chinese army. There are no more traces of the Japanese army in that area. The Japanese army in the Tudimiao area is still stubbornly resisting. The Chinese army has been fiercely fighting with the Japanese army in the Dongyumen area for days. The Chinese army has been attacking the Japanese army from all sides, causing heavy casualties to the Japanese army. On the afternoon of the 31st, a group of Japanese soldiers engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army near Yumen. (Dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Dr. Haas Arrives in Chongqing; Malaria Prevention Work Scheduled for Two Years; Health Authorities to Cooperate Effectively</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Dr. Haas, the leader of the American medical mission to the Yunnan-Burma Railway, arrived in Chongqing by plane from Kunming yesterday. He was accompanied by Dr. Wright and Mr. Jin, the guidance officer for health administration from the Chinese government. (United Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The American anti-malaria team, funded by the Lend-Lease Act, has arrived in western Yunnan Province. They will work there for two years to assist the Chinese in eradicating this disease during the construction of the Burma Road. The team has also received medical and testing equipment worth US$1 million under the Lend-Lease Act. The team leader is Dr. Haas, a renowned American malaria expert, and includes 15 experts (including physicians and sanitation engineers). In the first two months, they will investigate all aspects of the situation in the malaria-prone areas. Although their primary task is to protect the health of the workers building the Burma Road, their services will also be extended to the countryside. The Chinese health authorities are currently raising US$150,000 to organize a Chinese medical team, including 10 physicians, 5 entomologists, 5 sanitation engineers, 150 health inspectors, 500 trained workers, and 100 foremen. After the team is formed, it will cooperate with the American experts. (Dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Amidst the Emergency of the Pacific Situation, U.S. Naval and Air Force Commanders Arrive; Japan Attempts to Avoid War and Seeks Understanding with the U.S.; Wavell's Visit to Singapore Is of Great Significance</h3>
<p>Manila, 4th (United Press): Brigadier General Brereton and Captain Rockwell arrived here today aboard the China Clipper to take up their respective posts as commander of the U.S. Army Air Force in the Philippines and commander of the 16th Naval District. After their arrival, the two immediately met with Lieutenant General MacArthur, commander of the Far East Army.</p>
<p>Washington, 4th (Reuters): The arrival of General Wavell, commander-in-chief of the British forces in India, in Singapore has heightened interest here in events in the Far East. Many people are now wondering why General Wavell would leave the Middle East lightly when the German army appears poised to spy on the Caucasus, unless the situation in the Far East has deteriorated unexpectedly. There is no one here who expects Japan to join the war immediately after Hitler's announcement that the United States has attacked Germany first. Everyone believes that Tokyo will actively use the provisions of the alliance that allow it to evade its obligations, as these provisions allow it to decide when and whether one of the allied countries has been attacked. The New York Times said that Hitler's statement was aimed at opening a door that would allow Japan to participate in an attack on the United States, but has not yet made such a difficult proposal to Japan. The meaning of President Roosevelt's words in his Navy Day speech, "History records who fired the first shot, and in the future, the most important thing will be who fired the last shot," must be well understood by Japan. News from the Japanese official news agency that has reached here states that Tojo will declare to the Diet that there is a time limit for negotiations with the United States. Americans regard this statement as nothing more than a tactic of psychological warfare. As far as is known, the Japanese participants in the talks here have never mentioned a time limit. There is not the slightest sign of appeasement towards Japan here. Various indications prove that the U.S. government is still adhering to the policies it has been pursuing. If Japan wants its talks with the U.S. to make any progress, then withdrawing its troops from China is a difficult hurdle that Japan must overcome. Everyone believes that Japan is eager to find a way to extricate itself from the quagmire it is trapped in in China. Therefore, although withdrawing its troops from China may seem like a negative thing, it is indeed a path that Japan must find for itself. At the same time, Washington officials have always maintained a calm attitude towards the Far East.</p>
<p>London, 4th (Reuters): The Times commented on the situation in the Far East, saying that people here generally feel that Japan has no intention of advancing south or attacking north at present, and expect that Tokyo may not act according to Hitler's suggestion that the United States has attacked Germany and Japan should attack the United States. The newspaper also said that it is also believed here that the sudden arrival of General Wavell, commander-in-chief of the British forces in India, in Singapore may have a good psychological impact on Tokyo.</p>
<p>Washington, 4th (United Press): A senior government official said last night that although Tokyo has issued warnings, the United States will not comply with "time limits" in the current talks with Japan. He said that the U.S. government will not comply with the alleged ultimatums, nor will it withdraw its consistent stance on the Far East. The official pointed out that Japan launched these talks to avoid conflict in the Pacific. He said that the United States has expressed its willingness to avoid naval conflict in the Pacific. The United States will not abandon the interests of China, the Netherlands, and Britain. The governments of those countries have received assurances about the intentions of the United States after they expressed their fears about the U.S.-Japan talks. He added that the United States insists on emphasizing that it is only conducting "talks" and not "negotiations." In fact, U.S. officials hope that the result of these talks will be nothing more than a diplomatic "timeout." The official said that Japan's new threats and warnings are believed to be due to pressure from Berlin. It is not believed here that Japan intends to truly engage in war until Japan deeply believes that the democratic countries in Europe have been completely defeated.</p>
<p>Washington, 4th (International News Service): According to news from various parts of the Far East received by the State Department, it is increasingly believed that Japan is planning to find a "compromise solution" with the United States regarding the Pacific problem. The possibility of a comprehensive understanding with the United States, which is currently at a stalemate, is being discussed. Tokyo is also considering whether to conclude a limited agreement with the United States in order to avoid an early break with the United States while restoring U.S. oil shipments to Japan. Well-informed sources believe that Japan's limited agreement proposal will include the following key points: (1) The U.S. should restore normal commerce with Japan, especially restore oil shipments to Japan; (2) In return, Japan will "ignore" Berlin's accusation that the U.S. attacked Germany in a recent naval battle, and the danger of Japan participating in the war on the side of the Axis powers will be immediately eliminated; (3) Japan will not interfere with the interests of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>Tokyo Newspapers Filled with Anti-American Sentiment, Demanding Government Break the Encirclement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (United Press): Tokyo newspapers today continue to express anti-American sentiment and declare in the same tone that the Diet, which is about to open, must inspire the public spirit to destroy the ABCD encirclement. The newspapers argue that the Diet's greatest mission is to awaken the people, destroy the encirclement of hostile countries, so as to end the China Incident and build the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The newspapers also say that, for this reason, Prime Minister Tojo will deliver a speech at the opening of the Diet, frankly and openly explaining the current situation, and reporting on the progress of the Washington talks and the government's determination to take countermeasures. They also say that General Tojo's speech will not only be valued domestically, but will also be closely watched by the whole world, because it is believed that the speech is of great importance to the international political situation. The newspapers also say that the government is drafting the speech with great caution. Although yesterday was a national holiday, four cabinet officials devoted themselves to drafting the speech for three hours. The speech is expected to be submitted to the cabinet for review next week. The newspapers also predict the content of Tojo's speech in the same tone. The Asahi Shimbun wrote an editorial in its consistent style, explaining the new way for Japan to implement its national policy, saying that resolving the China Incident and establishing the "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" are Japan's unshakable national policies. The Asahi Shimbun also said, "In order to achieve the great goal, Japan must improve its relations with friendly countries, so as to complete the national affairs organization system at home and abroad. Based on this supreme wartime front, Japan can take a stern attitude towards the enemy countries and promote its own national policy for self-defense and for the survival of the Far East."</p>
<h3>Japan Avoids Explaining Who Fired First in German-U.S. Conflict; Ishii Says He Has Not Received Detailed Information; Maintains Independent View on Alliance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Reuters): When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii greeted foreign reporters as usual on Tuesday morning, he was asked whether Japan agreed with Germany's statement that the United States had attacked Germany first. Ishii replied that Japan is now exercising its own independent opinion and that the question of implementing Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact has not yet been mentioned. Japan has not yet received detailed information on the maritime conflict between Germany and the United States. Ishii went on to say that when a certain Japanese ship was about to leave San Francisco, the U.S. Treasury Department demanded to inspect certain types of mail on board, which was extremely unpleasant. As to whether this action was justified, he was not entirely sure, but the U.S. authorities should not have done this hastily, causing the ship to leave the mail behind. Ishii also answered another question, saying that the U.S.-Japan talks in Washington have not stopped, but since the formation of the Tojo Cabinet, the two sides have only met once. When asked whether the increased anti-American movement in Japanese newspapers reflected the government's attitude, Ishii declined to answer, but said that what the newspapers expressed was their own opinion, but it did reflect the opinion of the majority of the Japanese people.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government to Explain Policies</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Reuters): The Provisional Cabinet Meeting has decided to hold a session on November 24th, following the end of the extraordinary session of the Diet. Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Togo, Navy Minister Shimada, Finance Minister Kaya, and other cabinet members will attend and explain in detail the government's military, diplomatic, and economic policies.</p>
<h3>U.S. Islands in the Pacific Evacuate Women and Children; Japanese Residents Evacuate Singapore</h3>
<p>Honolulu, 4th (Havas):</p>
<p>According to British sources, American women and children on Guam and Midway Island in the Pacific have been evacuated due to the current situation.</p>
<p>Singapore, 4th (United Press): It was learned today that 498 Japanese people have reserved berths on the Asama Maru, which is scheduled to arrive here around November 15th. Consul General Tsurumi will also evacuate.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Broadcasts Warning to Thailand</h3>
<p>Singapore, 4th (Reuters): A Thai-language broadcast from Tokyo was heard here today, warning Thailand that its situation is even worse than China's was when the Sino-Japanese War broke out. While Japan admires Thailand's efforts to build its nation, it feels that its dependence on various countries, especially Britain and the United States, for supplies poses a serious danger. If this situation continues, Thailand's nationalism may suffer the same fate as the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek, leading it to regard Japan as its enemy and cooperate with Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>British Empire Considers Changing Attitude Toward Japan</h3>
<p>Currently in Consultation with Various Autonomous Territories; Duff Cooper Arrives in Australia for Observation</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 4th – Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated here today that the British Empire is now considering changing its attitude towards Japan. The UK is currently consulting with its autonomous territories regarding the attitude to be adopted towards Japan. This consultation includes considerations beyond the scope of Europe. At the same time, Overseas Australian Army Commander General Blamey will arrive in Australia next week to consult with the War Cabinet and the War Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Havas, Batavia, 3rd – British government's Special Commissioner for the Far East, Duff Cooper, traveled by plane to the Commonwealth of Australia today for inspection. Before his departure, he stated in a speech that after arriving in Sydney, Commonwealth of Australia, he would proceed to the Dominion of New Zealand to study the administrative adjustments of the Far Eastern territories.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 4th – According to Dutch East Indies official sources, the American "Catalina" type military aircraft will soon be transported there. This aircraft can fly from Batavia to Taiwan and then fly back without landing.</p>
<h3>War Approaches India; Britain Concerned about Indian Political Situation; Burmese Prime Minister Active in London, Demanding Post-War Autonomous Status</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – "New Statesman" newspaper published an article titled "War Approaches India," discussing the Indian political situation related to the war. It stated that it is not surprising that Burmese Prime Minister U Saw is requesting the British government to clearly commit to granting Burma dominion status after the war. If the British government delays or refuses, U Saw has warned that "the consequences will be unpleasant or even dangerous," as Japan has made very agile suggestions. We must know that the Japanese have used Buddhism to establish friendly ties with the Burmese people. In U Saw's way of thinking, the Burmese will see no difference between being in the Japanese co-prosperity sphere and being within the British Empire unless we grant them dominion status. The possibilities contained in the new situation in Asia may well serve as a useful warning to the British government to change its policy. Now, war is approaching India and Burma. If the Soviet Union loses more territory in the Caucasus and near the Caspian Sea, then India will play a crucial role in the final outcome, its significance probably no less than that of many armed divisions. Both sides should urgently approach each other and reach mutual understanding. Delaying a decision is not only unwise but also dangerous. As the war shifts eastward, those affected are no longer just the British Empire. We also know that there is a growing sentiment among young people in India, not only among the pacifists of Gandhism but also leaning towards the left. It is unacceptable for a large country like India to stand passively by in a struggle in which its future and our future are intertwined. Indians residing in Britain, mostly young people and mostly members of the All-India Congress Committee, recently gathered in London and argued that if India could participate with dignity, it should actively support the war effort in various ways. Now, if India truly wants to fight for itself and to defeat totalitarianism, rather than fighting for us or the British King, then it should gladly do so under its own national government. We have never proposed a formal change in the constitution during wartime, only to transform the Governor-General's Executive Council into a national cabinet, and to instruct the Governor-General to regard the Executive Council as the cabinet. There is one more step to be taken, which is to have this national government prepare the procedures for post-war consultation with Britain to implement its self-determination, and Britain should commit to respecting India's decision. In this way, we can hope for India's full cooperation in the war. Britain needs India as its ally as much as it needs the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Reuters, Detroit, 4th –</p>
<p>As British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax went to meet Bishop Mooney today and was entering the building, a number of women holding a peace demonstration threw eggs and tomatoes at him.

<h3>Robin Moor Incident: United States Demands Compensation, Rejected by German Government</h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 4th – After the American ship "Robin Moor" was sunk by a German submarine in August, the U.S. government lodged two protests with Germany and demanded compensation of $2,967,092 for damages. It is now learned that Germany has refused. It is reported that the German Chargé d'Affaires Thomson stated in a reply to Secretary of State Hull, "My government finds it difficult to respond to your two letters."</p>
<h3>German Submarines Active; American Oil Tanker Struck by Torpedo; Incident Location Southwest of Iceland; Although Heavily Damaged, Safely Reached Port; 95 Missing American Crew Members Presumed Dead</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th – According to the Navy Department, the U.S. Navy oil tanker "Salinas" received a warning and was attacked by a torpedo on the evening of October 29th. The incident location was southwest of Iceland. The ship was heavily damaged but safely reached port. This incident occurred the night before the U.S. destroyer "Reuben James" was sunk. As it was necessary to wait for the ship to reach port safely, the news was not announced immediately. The ship was escorted by warships when it was attacked. Details of the damage have not been released. This is the fourth Sino-American naval vessel to be attacked by torpedoes in two months. The ship has a displacement of 16,800 tons, is equipped with two 5-inch caliber guns, and anti-aircraft guns. There are a total of 107 crew members.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th – Yesterday, the Navy Department announced that the seven officers and eighty-eight sailors missing from the U.S. destroyer "Reuben James," which sank near Iceland last week, are presumed dead. A total of forty-five people were rescued, eighteen of whom were injured.</p>
<h3>China Anti-Aggression League Prays for Victory of Democratic Countries, Issues Declaration Demanding Accelerated Aid to China</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The China Anti-Aggression League recently issued a declaration praying for the victory of democratic countries, clearly announcing three things to the world: First, the Three Principles of the People are integrated with various progressive ideologies of the world, so their realization is the goal of the Chinese people's efforts and struggles today. Second, the culprits who are destroying world peace today are Nazi Hitler, Fascist Mussolini, and the Japanese militarists. They have formed an axis and want to rule the entire world and enslave the people of the world. If the people of the democratic countries continue to act for their own selfish interests and do not thoroughly awaken and take united action quickly, they will inevitably be defeated by the aggressors. China's resistance to aggression is not only to protect its security, but also for world justice and peace. It is hoped that the democratic countries will provide effective assistance quickly so that victory can come sooner. Third, the two Chinese characters for peace, "和平" (hé píng), mean "peace after leveling." After the last war, Wilson's Fourteen Points were not implemented, which was the root cause of this disaster. Now, the eight principles agreed upon by U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill can be considered important principles that are close to justice, close to the Three Principles of the People, and practically feasible. Therefore, we are willing to work together with the people of all democratic countries to promote their realization. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>Ji Youmu Hosts Dinner for Various Officials</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Belgian Ambassador to China, Ji Youmu, and his wife hosted a banquet today to entertain Chinese government officials, including Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng, Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, and Vice Minister Peng of the Ministry of Communications. (4th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Forms Chinese Defense Corps with Good Results</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – The Hong Kong government recruited hundreds of Chinese workers, students, and businessmen to serve as Chinese defense personnel today, demonstrating that Chinese compatriots here are showing responsibility for defending Hong Kong in times of crisis. However, the number recruited today was limited to only fifty. They will be the core of a certain regiment to be established soon (rumored to be a machine gun regiment). After the first fifty pass the examination, another one hundred and fifty will be recruited. The Hong Kong side warmly welcomes the enthusiastic cooperation of the Chinese people and the local defense authorities, and stated that the organization of the Chinese Defense Corps has been approved by the Chinese government. However, the recruitment campaign for defense corps members, which began on the 1st of this month, is still continuing, with 170 applicants already. The work of the defense corps is divided into labor service, transportation, special police, medical care, and firefighting groups. (Chuan Daily News)</p>

<h3>Far East Anti-Aggression Front</h3>
<p>Recently, because the possibility of large-scale aggression by Japan is very high, the solidarity of the ABCDR front has been strengthened unprecedentedly. Now everyone sees very clearly that if this front did not exist in the Far East, Japan's northward or southward advance might have already become a reality. However, precisely because the Eastern violent power holds infinite fear for the formation of this front, it is constantly seeking gaps, trying to break through one by one, break through the encirclement, forming the current threatening state of waiting for an opportunity to attack. The only solution for the ABCDR group facing this situation is to strengthen its own unity and cooperation, to use overwhelming force to stop the aggressive forces from taking further risks, and to promote the early arrival of common total victory through close cooperation and assistance. Otherwise, if a considerable gap and weakness appear in a certain point or aspect, then it is only natural for the aggressor to take the opportunity to act, and the outbreak of war in the Pacific Ocean will become an inevitable deduction.</p>
<p>The factual formation of the ABCDR front has been repeatedly emphasized by the authoritative authorities of various countries today. Its existence has been unanimously recognized by all observers. However, formally, it has not gone through the formalities and documents of an alliance, and in the process of its creation, it is entirely a historical product following a gradual procedure, unlike the German-Japanese-Italian alliance, which suddenly announced their alliance relationship to the world with a piece of legislation. Tracing back to the root, its emergence is entirely due to the situation of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance gradually created. Therefore, its spirit is really spread to all anti-aggression countries in the world, and in its application, there is no question of treating the Eastern and Western groups separately. However, because of the geographical relationship and the historical background of its emergence, the largest object of its application today is obviously still focused on the Far East, this is one; and given that Japan is loudly advocating southward and northward advances, and is simultaneously hostile to all ABCDR countries, it is only natural that they have to unite together to jointly resist Japan, this is two. However, the Japanese side's claim that the biggest purpose of the ABCDR group is to surround Japan is completely inconsistent with reality and contradictory. The target they are surrounding is aggressive actions, the so-called Greater East Asia New Order, and the violent spirit and psychology that produces such actions and policies, and is not limited to a specific country. Regarding this, as long as we briefly review the process of participation of various countries in this front, then we can immediately understand.</p>
<p>First, let’s talk about China. Due to the result of its four years of strong and hard fighting, and due to the special importance of its geographical location, there is no doubt that it is the largest pillar of this group. However, in the early stage of China's war, even before Germany, Italy, and Japan formally formed an alliance last September, China's diplomatic policy has always followed a very cautious path. On the positive side, it avoided any alliance-like relationship with any friendly allies, so that it would not drag itself into the whirlpool of other international disputes, only shouting that all those who help China fight and do not hinder China's struggle are China's good friends. On the negative side, it also tried its best not to offend any country that echoed Japan. However, this basic position was greatly shaken when Germany, Italy, and Japan formally formed an alliance last year and mutually recognized each other's so-called "new order." Since this spring, the mutual alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan has attempted to obstruct British and American assistance to China, and it has further convinced the Chinese authorities. Therefore, on the eve of Foreign Minister Guo's return home to take office, he pointed out for the first time in London the necessity of full cooperation between the ABC countries. When the conditions for the formation of the ABCDR group were fully mature after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Germany and Italy suddenly recognized the results of Japan's aggressive actions and despised the existence of China's legitimate sovereignty, which prompted China to take the step of full membership. And from the recent statements of China's top authorities, we can know that China is now completely standing on this front and engaging in resolute struggle.</p>
<p>Next are Britain and the United States. Until July last year, when Britain agreed to Japan's blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Highway for three months, its basic diplomatic policy was still stagnating at the stage of treating the Eastern and Western aggressors separately. Germany, Italy, and Japan formally formed an alliance, and cooperated to establish a new order, and it suddenly woke up and realized that it was one of the targets on both sides at the same time. In early spring and May this year, Japan's repeated echo of the German and Italian offensives and the brewing of actions in the East made Britain realize that taking the most resolute stance in the Far East and its operations in Europe were equally important for the survival of its empire. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, Britain and the Soviet Union immediately formed an alliance, so that Japan would have to confront Britain head-on whether it advanced south or north. In addition, the United States, for the past year, has moved from a position of aiding China and Britain to aiding China, Britain, and the Soviet Union; from the attitude of a third-party aid to the spirit of not hesitating to fight a war now. All of this has completely determined the status of Britain and the United States in this front.</p>
<p>Again, the Soviet Union. Until recently, we have not heard its expression on this front. However, in international relations, it is an ally with Britain, and the most reliable friendly country that has shared weal and woe with China for four years; and in the past record, it has had several glorious achievements such as Zhanggufeng and Nomunhan. The Soviet Union is a country that emphasizes action and does not advocate empty words, so there is of course no doubt about its position in this front.</p>
<p>Finally, adding the Dutch East Indies, which has a very clear attitude, thus, this constitutes the strong ABCDR front in the Far East today.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt-Churchill: The Beginning and End of the Atlantic Meeting (3)</h3>
<p>On the morning of the day we met the convoy, HMS Prince of Wales was visited by the Prime Minister and his party to observe a live ammunition exercise with anti-aircraft guns. First, a smoke bomb was launched and exploded high in the air, turning into a cloud of black smoke, then it was used as a target, and the anti-aircraft guns were opened, and flowering shells bloomed around the smoke. Finally, all the anti-aircraft guns on the ship were opened together to form a barrage of fire. The two sides of the battleship seemed to be constantly in flames, and the intensity of the firepower made the air around the ship black with smoke. It is hard to believe that a warship can fire such a fierce barrage of fire.</p>
<p>Churchill landed at a port in Scotland and immediately took the overnight train back to London. When he drove into the station the next morning, the platform was crowded with hundreds of welcoming civil and military officials. When Churchill's round body stepped out of the special car, the people on the platform cheered in unison.</p>
<p>Mrs. Churchill hurried down the platform. The Lord Privy Seal Attlee and the Lord President of the Council Anderson, one thin and one fat, followed closely behind. Churchill grinned and watched them approach, then embraced her tightly and gave her a kiss.</p>
<p>Churchill returned to the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, immediately convened a special meeting of the War Cabinet, reported to the cabinet members in detail, and then drove to Buckingham Palace to see King George VI and present President Roosevelt's reply.</p>
<p>Two days later, Churchill broadcast to the country and abroad, reporting on the situation of this maritime meeting. In ten years, his public speeches had rarely been more fluent than this one. He began confidently, "I think you must want me to report on my trip across the ocean and my meeting with our great friend, the President of the United States... In a vast bay surrounded by land, the powerful American fleet, protected by many small ships and long-range aircraft, waited for our arrival and seemed to reach out to lead us in...</p>
<p>"President Roosevelt and I stayed there cordially for three days. At the same time, the Chiefs of Staff and the commanders of the Army and Navy of the United Kingdom and the United States sat aside and held meetings together. "When the President and I held meetings at sea, we had the understanding that we did not want to prescribe a formal and final peace policy or combat goals, but we must formulate a concise wartime declaration to serve as the guideline for the future operations of the United Kingdom and the United States.

<h3>Moscow Front: Unprecedented Great Bloody Battle Occurs; Germany Pours All Its Strength into Re-Attacking Soviet Capital; Southern Route: Germany Peeks at Sevastopol</h3>
<p>International News Agency, Berlin, 4th – Local officials stated yesterday that Rostov, an important Soviet industrial center and gateway to the Caucasus oil fields, will soon fall into the hands of the German army. At the same time, they also stated that a large-scale offensive against the Caucasus has been launched. It is claimed that the recent attack on Crimea is the preliminary stage of the attack on the Caucasus. Most of this small island protruding south into the Black Sea has been invaded by the German army. Stuka dive bombers are currently bombarding Soviet mountain positions at the southern end of Crimea. Although Soviet resistance is very fierce, it has not prevented the German army from advancing. Various German bombers are also continuing to bomb Sevastopol, the major naval base in Crimea, destroying a large number of ships there and along the coast. Officials announced that more than fourteen Soviet divisions stationed on Crimea failed to stop the German army from advancing, and these Soviet troops are about to be eliminated. Since the German air force launched a full-scale offensive against the Soviet port of Novorossiysk, the war has actually extended to the Caucasus. German military commentators said that the German air force has sounded the death knell for the remnants of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. They also said that the German army is advancing very quickly because it has the experience of the First World War.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Kuybyshev, 4th – An unprecedented great bloody battle in history is currently taking place on the Moscow front. At the same time, the German army is mobilizing fresh reserve troops, wielding tanks and artillery, and pouring all its strength into re-attacking the Soviet capital. The situation in Crimea and Rostov is critical, so Soviet officials are paying close attention to the central and southern routes. (London Daily Express yesterday published a dispatch from the Swedish capital saying that 400 German planes bombed the Soviet capital for half an hour.)</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, New York, 4th – According to Soviet sources, 200,000 fresh Red Army troops have been dispatched to the Moscow front. It is heard that these reinforcements were drawn from reserve troops in the rear.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – According to news received here, the battles on various fronts in the Soviet territory have become more intense again. There are signs that the long-awaited new German offensive against Moscow has been launched. The severe cold has made the ground on the front line in that area hard. The German army has repeatedly attacked along the arc line from Bely to Tula, but has been repelled by the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – It is reported that the German army is currently attacking Sevastopol (southwestern Crimea), an important base of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet. Recent Soviet communiqués confirmed that there are wars in the peninsula and Kalinin (100 miles northwest of Moscow). At the same time, unconfirmed news from Helsinki spread that seven Soviet warships have broken out of the mine area in the Gulf of Finland and sailed west. This statement has not been confirmed by any party. The Swedish Aftonbladet published a Berlin dispatch stating that the German army is currently advancing towards Sevastopol. The German side attaches great importance to the Crimean war because the German army can peep into the Caucasus from the peninsula. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a midnight communiqué stating that on November 3, our army fought against the enemy along the entire front, and the battles on the Crimean and Kalinin fronts were very fierce. On November 2, 13 German planes were destroyed, and 3 Soviet planes were also lost. On November 3, two German planes were shot down near Moscow. Reuters military commentators analyzed the Soviet war situation and said that the Germans are an unusually docile people, otherwise they would not be satisfied with the current results and would call for the results promised by the authorities. All Germans want to get Moscow, and Hitler has promised this. Day after day, the Germans hear news of victories everywhere on the northern, southern, and central routes, but Moscow is never mentioned. According to the German side, three weeks ago, it claimed that the Soviet army on the Moscow front had been cleared. At the same time, German casualties have increased unabated and suffered from the cold, which is well known to the Germans. The German army around Moscow has not advanced within fifty miles except in Mozhaisk.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Kuybyshev, 4th – Yesterday, local officials said that the German air force is constantly bombing Moscow. The news said that German planes are carrying out four or five air raids every day, but the losses to military targets are very small. Since the beginning of the war, Moscow has shot down 400 German planes, including 36 last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Expansion of German Black Sea Power: The Tatar Strait Becomes Increasingly Important</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – With Sevastopol now under imminent threat, the Tatar Strait has once again become critically important. Its importance to the countries along the Black Sea is no less than that of Gibraltar to the Mediterranean. If the Soviet Union's Black Sea pressure forces it to enter the Black Sea and challenge the Soviet navy, but Germany's recent rapid advances may not embarrass Turkey anymore. Germany may now simultaneously and firmly demand that Turkey not allow the Soviet Black Sea Fleet to escape from the Tatar Strait. In this environment, unless Turkey interprets the above-mentioned terms to allow the Soviet fleet to sail to bases in Vladivostok or Arkhangelsk, the Montreux Convention may eventually be used as a tool against the Soviet Union. If this kind of emergency situation occurs, Turkey will risk a direct conflict with Germany.</p>
<h3>Hull Advises Finland: Seek Peace with the Soviets, or You Cannot Maintain American Friendship; Reportedly Finland's Reply to the US is About to be Submitted</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - Secretary of State Hull, while receiving newspaper reporters, said that the United States has warned Finland that if it wishes to maintain American friendship, it must quickly cease its military actions against the Soviet Union. A reporter asked if it was true, as rumored from London, that Britain had delayed declaring war on Finland due to American opposition, which he said was completely unfounded. Hull replied that the US government had repeatedly called the Finnish government's attention to the concerns arising from the course the United States had taken toward Finland. According to Dow Jones News Service, Hull stated that the United States had dispatched a note to the Finnish government, warning it that Finland must promptly withdraw its battlefield troops and consider peace talks to maintain friendly relations between the US and Finland. Hull stated, "Instructions have recently been issued to the Minister to Finland to inform the Finnish government that if Finland wishes to maintain friendship with the United States, it must provide satisfactory evidence to show that Finland wishes to promptly cease its military offensive actions against the Soviet Union, and in principle will promptly withdraw Finnish troops. At the same time, the US Minister again presented to the Finnish government the information previously submitted to the Finnish Minister to the United States regarding the possibility of a peaceful resolution of various outstanding issues between Finland and the Soviet Union. The United States is now awaiting a reply from the Finnish government. It was noted that on August 18th, the Finnish Minister to the United States was informed by the US State Department that the Soviet Union was prepared to discuss a Finnish-Soviet peace agreement on the basis of compensating Finland with land. However, to date, neither Finnish officials in Helsinki nor spokespersons in the United States have indicated any intention to study this possibility. The United States is certainly aware that Finland is currently under pressure from Germany, and seeking peace with the Soviet Union may be difficult. However, Finland knows that its current government poses a threat to the independence and security of all anti-Nazi countries in the world, including Finland itself. If it continues its current policy, it is solely because the current Finnish government is no longer a free administrative body for the Finnish people, or because this policy is not freely chosen by the Finnish government and people."</p>
<p>United Press, Stockholm, 4th - A Finnish official news agency dispatch from Helsinki yesterday, from reliable sources, stated that the Finnish government has received a note from the United States regarding Finnish-Soviet peace negotiations. The news agency stated that Finland's reply could be issued recently.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - Secretary of State Hull's comments yesterday regarding Finland were quite clear. Well-informed sources have long known that Hull's patience with the Finnish government and public is waning. Finnish spokespersons have said much, but the State Department now wants to see action. Finnish Prime Minister Tanner's conversation with a New York Times reporter, denying any connection between Finland and the Nazis, was followed within hours by Hull's reprimand, which can truly be called a severe condemnation. Finland's failure to utilize the possibility of peace with the Soviet Union in August has created a negative impact in US official circles. While Americans do not wish to fight against the Finnish people, many believe that Hull's words imply that if Finland does not provide assurances on this demand, the United States will support Britain's declaration of war on Finland.</p>
<h3>Two US Submarines Transferred to British and Polish Navies</h3>
<p>Reuters, New London, 4th - In a ceremony held here today, two US submarines were transferred to the British and Polish navies, respectively. According to Colonel Cronan, commander of the New London submarine base, the one transferred to the British is a 600-ton R-class submarine, and the one transferred to Poland is an 800-ton S-class submarine. These two submarines are the first batch of submarines transferred to belligerent nations under the Lend-Lease Act. While these two vessels were being refitted, British and Polish crew members have been stationed here for some time, and will practice on similar submarines. The submarine transferred to Britain was built in 1918, while the other was built in 1921.</p>

<h3>Bureau Rice Sold Sparsely; Rice Shops Adopt Shuttle Tactics; Only Two Seen Selling After a Long Distance</h3>
<p>The sale of rice by the Bureau of Public Works is still sporadic. Very few rice shops are seen with signs indicating the sale of Bureau rice. This morning, from Avenue Edward VII, Quai de Card, along Route Cardinal Foch, Avenue du Roi Albert, Avenue Joffre, Rue Massenet, all the way to Avenue Foch, only two were seen selling Bureau rice: one at the entrance of Kwang Jen Li on Avenue Edward VII, and the other at the intersection of Route Cardinal Foch and Avenue du Roi Albert. The people buying rice at both locations were densely packed, front to back, pressed so tightly that many were short of breath. At around 8:30 in the morning, in front of the Brothers Barber Shop on Avenue du Roi Albert, two middle-aged and elderly people and three women and children in the rice queue were attacked from both front and back, and were squeezed out of the line, falling to the ground. Stronger people took the opportunity to join the line. These five people had to push and shove for quite some time before they could rejoin the line. There were also people in the front of the line who were forcibly dragged out by those who came later, who then occupied their positions. Those who were dragged out were beaten when they tried to rejoin. Until around 11 o'clock, the rice shops had already stopped selling, and those waiting in line on the sidewalk still had numbers written on their coats in chalk, numbering more than five hundred. Hungry and empty-bellied, but the rice was still in the rice shop, and the rice shop was resting. Returning to Avenue Edward VII, a sign was seen posted at the rice shop stating that the imported rice from Hong Kong was sold out, and those waiting in line inside the barbed wire fence still stretched into Kwang Jen Li. It is only when life reaches this point that one realizes that eating is the most difficult thing. It's all about wanting to buy Bureau rice because it is slightly cheaper, but who would have thought that Bureau rice is also hard to get. How can the general working class afford this kind of treatment if they want to buy it? Rice shops are adopting shuttle tactics for selling their own rice, otherwise, why would only two shops be selling Bureau rice after such a long journey? However, it also shows the extent of the supply of Bureau rice. There were a few rhyming verses on the spot as proof:</p>
<p>To buy a measure of rice,</p>
<p>One must rise early at dawn.</p>
<p>Who knew when the sun is near noon,</p>
<p>The pot is still empty and moans.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Bureau of Public Works' affordable imported rice is still arriving continuously. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 10,200 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong. Also, the Chongqing Wheel arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying 10,200 bags of imported rice from Hong Kong. They docked at the French Concession's Hong Kong Wharf for unloading. The two ships together carried 20,400 bags, all of which were the Bureau of Public Works' affordable small-sized imported rice. Furthermore, the Chongqing Wheel also had 2,400 bags of imported rice, scheduled to be shipped to Tianjin on the same ship within the next few days. (Zu)</p>
<p>The imported rice market has eased slightly. As gold prices have fallen, customers are no longer hoarding as eagerly as before. Moreover, after the inspection by the Bureau of Public Works, the rice industry associations have repeatedly advised restraint. Some speculators have slightly receded, and many scattered households have slightly released their hoards. Therefore, after an initial boost in the morning market, prices gradually returned to normal. Small-sized rice was once as high as 174.5 yuan, but later settled to 172-173 yuan. Ying Wah Sze's small-sized rice once opened at a high price of 206 yuan, but there were few takers. However, there are still a few market bullies trying to push up prices, so although the market atmosphere is calm, the prices are still chaotic. The total transaction volume of ready rice in the city was more than 10,000 bags, and Ying Wah Sze had 500-600 tons. The market bullies' attempt to shout high prices ultimately failed to materialize. If No. 1 Saigon rice did not see any transactions due to its high price, then there was not much change in general mid-range goods. In the mid-market opening, No. 1 Siam opened at 181 yuan to 180 yuan, No. 2 at 173-174 yuan, small-sized at 173-174 yuan, broken tip at 144 yuan, No. 2 Saigon at 181-182 yuan, and Min Dang was quoted from 190 yuan down to 185 yuan. But later, the buying sentiment was not strong, and gradually softened. As a result, at the close of the market, small-sized rice was only 171-172 yuan to 170 yuan, and foreign warehouses were at 168-169 yuan, down by two to three yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>The total arrival of thick and thin japonica rice was only two to three hundred piculs. Therefore, the sellers in the morning market were quite firm in their intention to sell, and made great efforts to push up prices. Kunshan new japonica rice opened at 207 yuan, Qingjiao kiln seed at 205-206 yuan, and Nangang early break also at 205-206 yuan, an increase of as much as five or six yuan. However, the market softened later, as it saw that imported rice was not expanding and that there was no clear outlet. Therefore, the result was that Nangang early break was at 204 yuan, then down to 202.5 yuan, Kunshan new japonica at 204 yuan, then down to 200 yuan, and Qingjiao kiln seed at 202-203 yuan, an actual increase of only two or three yuan. The rare Sijing wild rice continued to sell tightly at 205-206 yuan. Kunshan new Du Jian, with an arrival of sixty to seventy piculs, opened at 191 yuan to 190.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, which had no transactions the day before, saw a relatively broader outlet yesterday. Because the sellers were interested in Hong Kong dollars, Hong Kong dollars actually opened at 211-212 yuan, with special grades at 214-215 yuan, soaring by ten yuan or more compared to the week before. Glutinous tea also opened at 191-192 yuan. As for national glutinous rice, it has not been opened.</p>
<h3>Golden Dragon Brand Vermicelli: No Buyer at 60 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Grain Guild continued to suspend trading, and there were still no formal transactions for vermicelli. However, as gold prices fell and rice prices stabilized, the atmosphere outside the market also eased. The day before yesterday, there were still no sellers for the Golden Dragon brand at 60 yuan, but yesterday, although they shouted 60 yuan, there was no buyer. The bran, which was originally hoarded by the industry on the pretext of scarce supply, was raised by another one or two yuan per small bag, opening at 57.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Huge Amount of Gold Bars Arrive: Gold Prices Plunge to 1,800 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market was severely bearish, with prices falling close to the 20,000 yuan mark. People were greatly panicked, and the market price was constantly under selling pressure. It is rumored that huge amounts of gold bars have arrived from Tianjin and Nanjing, and that securities firms and a certain gold shop were the first to sell them off. From the early morning, a certain money shop first offered ten taels at a price of 22,150 yuan, lowering it by 350 yuan. Securities firms then sold to two gold shops, ten taels each, for 22,100 yuan. A certain jewelry store followed the steps of the silver shops and shouted for lower prices to sell. Securities firms (on behalf of Tianjin firms) and cash shops also sold. At noon, the price fell to 21,400 yuan, and at midday, it was 21,500 yuan. In the afternoon, a small money shop first offered ten taels for 21,350 yuan, 150 yuan lower. A certain gold shop (on behalf of Nanjing firms) and securities firms then competed to sell, and cash shops also sold, dropping another 850 yuan. The lowest price was between two gold shops, who exchanged ten taels for 20,500 yuan. A certain jewelry store bought a small amount, and an outside customer came to buy. At 4 o'clock, it rebounded to 20,700 yuan, a drop of 1,800 yuan compared to the previous day's final price. The trading volume was active, with the high and low prices differing by 1,650 yuan. Gold shop brand gold was sold in the market for around 21,000 yuan and bought in for about 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Marked Down by 130 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in jewelry stores, Datong Heng and Xin Tong Heng, was marked down by 30 yuan in the morning, to 2,220 yuan. In the afternoon, it was marked down twice, a total of 100 yuan, to 2,120 yuan (bought in for around 2,000 yuan), a reduction of 130 yuan. As for fine silver, Datong Heng and Xin Tong Heng did not list the price. When asked, they said it was still 22 yuan per tael. The labor cost of various ornaments has increased by 250 percent, and it is reported that unscrupulous merchants outside the industry are doing underground trading, raising the price to 33-34 yuan per tael.</p>
<h3>British Exchange Rate Sees High Prices Again; Market Begins to Rebound; US Dollars Enter the 40 Yuan Range</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the posted rates of the Central Bank and HSBC. The HSBC counter price was also flat. The black market for British and American exchange rates was tight first, then slightly rebounded. Recently, sugar trading firms have been buying up foreign exchange due to the arrival of goods, pushing the British gold exchange rate to an unprecedented high of one penny and seventy-five, and the US dollar exchange rate to two yuan and sixty-two and a half. Both were sold by a certain industrialist silk merchant. Later, the buying frenzy subsided as there were rumors that the Stabilization Fund would increase the amount of legitimate commercial exchange settlements this month. At noon, it began to harden, and in the afternoon, there were buyers for British gold at two pence and US dollars at three yuan, with prices similar to the closing prices of the previous night.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds falling by 10 yuan along with the spot gold price. The market price of British gold notes rose by 3 yuan due to the need for funding. The price of US dollar notes rose to 41 yuan again in the morning, but soon fell, retreating to 39.8 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 7 jiao compared to the previous day. There was still a demand for Hong Kong dollar notes, and the market price continued to rise by 2 jiao. The price of Japanese yen notes and Korean won notes rose even more sharply, with the former rising to 3 yuan and 9 jiao 3 fen, and the latter rising to 3 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<h3>Future Yarn Adds 100 Yuan; Settlement Prices Evened Out; Shuang Ma Factory Orders See High Prices Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the momentum remained tight. This is because raw materials are rising daily, leading to a generally bullish outlook. The morning opening price for 20-count Shuang Ma Factory orders was 3,110 yuan, but those gathered in the market all wanted to buy, so the situation remained enthusiastic. In one go, it rose to a new record of 3,230 yuan, then slightly reduced profits, continuing to ease to 3,155 yuan. However, after the price fell, the buying sentiment rebounded, rising again to 3,190 yuan. The closing price was 3,185 yuan. The market turnover was relatively improved.</p>
<p>The situation of ready yarn was firm at first, then continued to rise, then returned to normal, but buyers were still numerous and energetic. Therefore, the selling price was going up round by round. Upon investigation, the intention to purchase was related to the rising cost of raw materials at the factory, so the idea of hoarding was still strong. It was found that the market price of ready yarn, both coarse and fine, wanted to rise by 7, 8, and 10 yuan, with about 600 packages being traded. Yihe Factory offered dozens of packages of Rouge Tiger, priced at 2,150 yuan.</p>
<p>The Jin Shuang Ma futures market, in order to take care of the market price soaring, the association resolved to temporarily settle the price, and the near and far months all rose by 100 yuan as the settlement standard. Both the long and short sides were evened out. The settlement price for November was 2,648 yuan, for December it was 2,704 yuan, and for January it was 2,758 yuan.</p>
<h3>On the Pretext of Weak Supply, Ready Cotton's Rising Momentum Remains Strong</h3>
<p>The situation of ready cotton: the rising momentum is unstoppable. However, the gold price has rebounded slightly, but people are still unwilling to relax, saying that the arrival of goods is weak, so the prices of coarse and fine cotton continue to rise by ten to twenty yuan. However, the trading is extremely light. The opening prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Durella 100 pieces 700.0, Jia Warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Oomra 100 pieces 758.0 again</p>
<p>Cao Huo Ji 250 bales 580.0 again</p>
<p>Again 500 bales 600.0 again</p>
<p>Lan Gong 100 pieces 720.0 again</p>
<p>Again 100 pieces 725.0 again</p>
<p>Again 100 pieces Open 35.0 again</p>
<p>Again 100 pieces 718.0 again</p>
<p>Again 100 pieces 720.0 again</p>
<p>Again 100 pieces 725.0 again</p>
<p>Again 95 pieces 720.0 again</p>
<h3>Although Sugar Arrives Steadily, Sugar Speculation is Red-Hot; Yesterday the Market Still Announced Rising Limits</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market's rising momentum remained strong. The futures group announced rising limits in both the morning and afternoon, showing that speculation is just getting started. The company's futures 24 Coarse White was still flat in the morning market. The opening price for November 10th was 330 yuan, which immediately jumped to 53 yuan. The opening price for the 20th was 360 yuan, then to 65 yuan, both announcing rising limits. In the afternoon, the opening price for the 10th was 360 yuan, then to 73 yuan, and the opening price for the 20th was 384 yuan to 5 yuan, then announcing rising limits, all up 40 yuan. The spot price for 24 Coarse White arriving in October was 345 yuan, 60 yuan, 62 yuan, and in the afternoon, 64 yuan to 77 yuan, then turning flat to 6 yuan, still up 10 yuan. September was 343 yuan to 60 yuan, and in the afternoon, 64 yuan to 76 yuan, then 55 yuan, up 11 yuan. August was 348 yuan to 58 yuan, and in the afternoon, 60 yuan, 75 yuan, and 56 yuan. Dutch Red was 305 yuan to 12 yuan, and in the afternoon, 22 yuan to 15 yuan, up 17 yuan. Hong Kong Coarse White was 316 yuan, 32 yuan, and in the afternoon, 40 yuan, 48 yuan, up 32 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark was 340 yuan, 60 yuan, 70 yuan, up 25 yuan. DY Mark was 334 yuan, 50 yuan, up 20 yuan. HX Mark was 322 yuan, 30 yuan, and in the afternoon, 40 yuan to 50 yuan. A total of more than 5,000 packages of futures were traded, and more than 38,000 packages of ready goods were traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Taiyuan Wheel brought another 9,425 packages of sugar, and the Chongqing Wheel also brought 3,000 packages of sugar from Hong Kong. Yesterday, a total of 12,425 packages of sugar arrived, but this is not enough to control the hoarding in the Shanghai sugar market. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Government Bonds are Relatively Firm; Foreign Stocks are Also Active</h3>
<p>The after-hours trading of government bonds was relatively firm yesterday. After falling for two consecutive days, it slightly rebounded. Category C broke 5 yuan twice, but ultimately closed at 5 yuan and 6 jiao, indicating that the shorts were a bit crowded, and short covering pushed the price up by several jiao. But the foundation still did not appear strong. The current market price of government bonds is affected by the soaring prices, and it is enough to stabilize it temporarily. Yesterday morning, Tong Kang, Tong Shun, and Shun Tai were all buying, and Run De Sheng and Da Jiu Feng once surged down. Category C once broke 5 yuan, then immediately went up. In the afternoon, Hong Da and Shun Tai bought, and there was also a considerable demand from retail investors. Although Hu He Ji and Yi Tai sold, opening at only 4 yuan and 9 jiao, the demand already exceeded the supply, and it was raised to 5 yuan and 7 jiao. The situation stabilized slightly, and then the course of the long and short sides was considered. As a result, the market price rose uniformly by one jiao and a half to five jiao. The total volume was about 1.6 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 500 shares of Meng Qiang Tong Zha Bei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 19 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market of the Public Industry Association was very active, the scope of transactions expanded, and the number of new buyers increased greatly, with prices rising to a peak. Rubber stocks were stronger than industrial stocks. British Wool Company shares debuted at a high price of 10 yuan and 75, and closed at 20 yuan. The transaction volume was extremely large.</p>
<h3>Eastern Cloth Wildly Surges and Plunges, Exaggerating Speculation</h3>
<p>The fine cloth, the leader of the eastern cloth spot market, surged and plunged, changing in an instant, which is rare in history. It rose linearly in the morning, reaching a peak of 136 yuan. Later, due to the profit-taking of the longs, it closed at 129 yuan and 5 jiao. The market opened in the afternoon, and once again stepped up, pulling back to 136 yuan. Suddenly, news came that the gold price had fallen, and sellers rose up, pushing it down to close at 124 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, it gradually trended upwards, with a slight consolidation in the middle. As a result, it was still higher than the previous day.</p>

<h3>New Supplementary Rules for Price Control Approved by Consular Body; Gradual Control of Prices of Various Essential Goods; Swire &amp; Co. Investigates Sugar Merchants' Refusal to Sell</h3>
<p>Pudong Salt Shipments to Shanghai Restricted, Salt Prices Subject to Profiteering</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), in order to manage the retail prices of goods within the Settlement, previously requested the Consular Body to approve new supplementary rules to the Land Regulations, so as to proceed with drafting current regulations regarding price control. It is now learned that the aforementioned supplementary rules have been formally approved by the Consular Body, and the SMC has issued a public notice announcing the contents of the new articles. The notice is reproduced below:</p>
<p>Approved New Supplementary Articles</p>
<p>"It is approved that the Senior Consul's letter informs that the proposed 'Supplementary Article 53 to the Land Regulations,' in accordance with Article 11 of the said Regulations, is hereby approved. The text of the new supplementary article is as follows: 'Any individual, partnership, or company that manufactures any goods shall comply with the rules published by the SMC from time to time regarding the quantity and storage location of such goods, the records that should be kept, or the prices at which they are sold. Any individual, partnership, or company that violates any provision contained in the rules promulgated by the SMC in accordance with this supplementary article shall be subject to (A) the penalties stipulated in Article 17 of the Land Regulations, or other penalties deemed fair by the competent court, or (B) the SMC may detain or revoke the license held by such individual, partnership, or company, or impose the aforementioned penalties concurrently with the detention or revocation of the license.'"</p>
<p>Consular Body Expresses Support for Suppressing Prices</p>
<p>The penalty rules stipulated in the new supplementary rules include those based on Article 17 of the Land Regulations. The text of that article states: "Hereafter, if anyone violates these Regulations, and a report is made to the Consul or the Consul is notified by a local official, the Consul may, within his jurisdiction, directly summon the violator to appear. If the facts are verified, he may impose a penalty, or commute the penalty to a fine of no more than three hundred dollars, or imprisonment for a term of no more than six months, or use other fair means. If the foreign violator has no Consul in Shanghai, the SMC may request the Consuls of one or more countries to file a lawsuit with the main Chinese authorities to maintain the integrity of these Regulations and punish the violators." Furthermore, Article 11 of the Land Regulations, upon which the Consular Body based its approval of the new supplementary rules, stipulates that the SMC authorities "have the right to issue additional rules at any time, and may cancel, alter, or amend the rules." It is generally believed that the Consular Body's approval of these new supplementary rules is not only in accordance with the regulations, but also because the Consular Body has previously expressed the need to suppress rising prices within the Settlement.</p>
<p>Detailed Management Rules to Be Announced at Any Time</p>
<p>According to an SMC official, the SMC will immediately take effective measures to exercise the power to manage prices granted by the new supplementary rules, because the SMC has already completed administrative and legal preparations in advance. As for which "items that should be subject to price control as announced by the SMC from time to time," the official said that this will include foreign rice, which has already begun, and essential commodities such as flour, which will begin soon. "The detailed rules will be announced by the SMC at any time." Other items "sold by food companies and pharmacies, such as imported or locally manufactured food, seasonings, cleaning supplies, medicines, cigarettes, tobacco, soap, and beverages, etc.," will also comply with these supplementary rules. The retail prices will be assessed in consultation with importers and manufacturers to provide a reasonable profit margin. The prices, once approved by the SMC, will be set as maximum prices and must not be exceeded. Violators will be punished in accordance with the new supplementary rules. Well-informed sources believe that the maximum prices for the above items will be assessed in the near future.</p>
<p>Bureau's Regulations to Be Discussed Daily</p>
<p>It is expected that the SMC will announce retail prices at any time hereafter, strictly ordering retailers to comply. The SMC has begun holding meetings every morning in the meeting room to discuss price control measures. SMC officials, such as Secretary Fessenden and Secretary Peissel, will review and handle price-related matters that arise daily. Yesterday, the SMC stated that a newspaper had reported a few days ago that 1 million bags of rice and 2 million bags of flour would be shipped to Tianjin by the Zao Sheng vessel. Because this statement was not factual and if not corrected, it would be mistaken as a reduction in the city's food reserves and stimulate price increases. The Bureau of Publications was instructed to send a letter to various newspapers for correction, and to publish the accurate number of bags shipped to Tianjin that day by the Fu Sheng vessel: 30,490 bags of flour, 5,200 bags of sugar, and 800 bags of rice.</p>
<p>Ample Sugar Stocks, Salt Shipments Obstructed</p>
<p>Recently, the SMC has been making every effort to control prices. In addition to daily necessities such as briquettes and flour, for which decisions have already been made, it is rumored that sugar will also be subject to control. According to inquiries, the current sugar stocks in various warehouses in the city are sufficient for one and a half years. Moreover, sugar sources are very smooth, with large quantities being shipped from the Dutch East Indies and other places. It is expected that once the SMC has devised control measures, sugar prices can be expected to fall sharply.</p>
<p>Sugar Merchants Refuse to Sell</p>
<p>Citizens in this city are currently suffering from being unable to purchase sugar. Those who can purchase it find that the selling price is astronomically high, breaking records and continuing to rise. This reporter contacted six major wholesale stores this morning (the 4th), five of which claimed that the sugar was sold out. The remaining one also said that it had sold the last bag, with a 10-pound bag reaching a huge 28 yuan. However, a responsible person from Swire &amp; Co., which distributes Taikoo Sugar, stated that sugar imports to Shanghai have been quite normal recently, and that Swire &amp; Co.'s supply of sugar to retailers has not decreased. In addition, there are tens of thousands of bags of granulated sugar stockpiled in the city. Retailers have no excuse not to sell sugar.</p>
<p>Reports Welcome</p>
<p>The public should report to Swire &amp; Co. if they are unable to purchase sugar from a particular store, so that the company can investigate whether these stores purchase sugar from Swire &amp; Co. If they do purchase from Swire, the company will take constructive steps to deal with it. The official continued that a Swire ship was slightly damaged en route to Shanghai, which may be the reason for the rumors of a sugar shortage. Some stores do not purchase sugar directly from Swire &amp; Co., but purchase it from intermediaries, and their sugar stocks may have decreased. However, in general, Shanghai's sugar supply is quite sufficient. A sugar shortage and halting the sale of sugar is not a valid excuse. However, the recent surge in prices of various commodities has been like a frenzy. The price of vermicelli at a certain food store doubled between 8:00 AM and 11:00 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Salt Prices Increase Again</p>
<p>Salt prices in the city have been soaring recently. Although it is not due to hoarding, retailers must be taking the opportunity to profiteer. In recent years, most of the salt used by Chinese residents in the two Settlements has been purchased from rural women in Pudong. It is rumored that these rural women have been unable to smuggle salt into the Settlements for sale recently due to restrictions imposed by Pudong authorities. A few days ago, citizens could still purchase 1.4 liang of salt per yuan from these salt vendors, but this is now rarely available. Retailers have taken the opportunity to raise salt prices, causing citizens to encounter a new difficulty in purchasing daily necessities at reasonable prices.</p>
<h3>100,000 Tons of Coal Dust to Be Shipped Soon</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news, major coal companies in the city have concluded transactions for approximately 150,000 tons of coal since the beginning of last month. Approximately 100,000 tons have already been loaded onto ships in the production area and are expected to be shipped within days. If there are no unforeseen circumstances, they are expected to arrive in port successively in mid-November. It is understood that most of the coal is coal dust needed for the manufacture of briquettes. However, this type of coal dust has all been ordered by major coal companies in the city. According to news from the coal industry, the coal dust needed for the manufacture of briquettes is still amply stored in the city, and there is no concern about future shortages. At the same time, because this coal dust was purchased in batches six months ago, its purchase price was very low. Therefore, the manufacturing costs of briquettes at major mechanized briquette factories in the city have not increased.</p>
<p>Coal Stock Numbers Have Not Yet Been Announced</p>
<p>The coal stored in various large and small warehouses in Pudong, Hongkou, western Shanghai, and the French Concession remains abundant as always. However, the Shanghai Coal Industry Association has sent letters to all member companies, requesting them to list and report all anthracite coal stocks to the association, so that it can know the exact amount of coal stocks. The association has set a deadline of the end of October for the completion of this survey. However, as of yesterday, the association has not yet announced the results of the survey to the public. However, according to those familiar with the coal market, the coal stored in various warehouses in the city is sufficient to meet the city's winter needs.</p>
<h3>Countries Inspect Shanghai Mail</h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Postal Administration, after the international situation became tense, all countries have implemented inspections of incoming and outgoing mail. In addition to the Far East, Hong Kong, Singapore, Manila, and Burma, where inspections have been in place for a long time, mail sent to Shanghai from the Soviet Union, the United States, Japan, and other places has recently been opened and inspected by local post offices. Japanese postal inspections are the most stringent. Letters and parcels sent by foreigners have not been spared. As for whether any mail has been detained, no reports have been received to date.</p>
<h3>After the Detention of the Southern Vessel, Protests to Customs</h3>
<p>The captain of the Yugoslav cargo ship "Tomislav," Mr. Baumgartner, stated that he had submitted a protest to the Jianghai Customs authorities yesterday morning regarding the detention of the "Tomislav." The vessel is under Yugoslavian sovereignty, and a telegram from the shipowner confirms that the vessel has not been transferred to any party. Although the Italian sailors on board have been withdrawn, three senior officers and thirty sailors from the "Contovant" vessel remain.</p>
<h3>Nanyang Business Investigation Group to Depart at the End of the Month; Executive Yuan Allocates 50,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Preparations for the Nanyang Business Investigation Group, organized by Shanghai and Hong Kong business circles, have been completed, and the Executive Yuan has approved a subsidy of 50,000 yuan from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The group has now appointed Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Shuchun, Dong Zhongwei, and Ye Lanquan as nominating committee members to review the qualifications of group members and the selection of members. It is hoped to include experts in textiles, enterprises, trade, and economics, as well as those with close ties to trade with India. The departure date is set for the end of this month, with a gathering in Hong Kong to depart.</p>
<h3>Forgetting Righteousness for Profit, Attempting to Hoard Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Since commodity prices in the city have been constantly rising, people are engaging in the accumulation of goods (especially daily necessities), causing prices to soar. Recently, some people, seeing that winter clothing prices are rising daily due to the cold weather, are attempting to purchase in large quantities the winter clothing distributed by various charitable organizations to impoverished citizens (such as the winter clothing made by the Sanjiao Daode Charity Council, weighing 3.3 jin and selling for 13 yuan, which would cost 17-18 yuan at current market prices). They plan to purchase them in thousands, but this has been discovered and rejected by the council. To prevent abuses, the council has specially stamped the name of the Sanjiao Council and the words "Charity Clothing" inside and outside the clothing. At the same time, it has notified all charitable organizations in the city not to be exploited and have the clothing purchased in large quantities, so as to avoid problems with the winter clothing for the poor.</p>
<h3>Angelica and Rhubarb Approved for Shipment to Restricted Areas; Limited to Exchange for Daily Necessities for Internal Transport; Supply of Essential Chinese Medicines Guaranteed</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently telegraphed the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce office in Hong Kong, stating that the ministry, after consideration, believes that the production of angelica and rhubarb is very abundant in the northwest provinces. If a long-term ban on transportation is in place, domestic sales will be limited, which will inevitably lead to overproduction and affect the rural economy. Moreover, angelica and rhubarb are essential Chinese medicines. In order to combine clearance with the transportation ban, it is tentatively decided to allow normal domestic merchants to purchase and transport angelica and rhubarb to restricted areas for sale, and exchange them for daily necessities to be transported to the rear. However, they must first apply to the local chamber of commerce for a letter of guarantee, and submit it for approval to issue a transportation permit. After the exchanged goods are transported back, they must still report to the local competent authority for inspection and submit the permit for cancellation, in order to implement control. This is hereby telegraphed for notification.</p>

<h3>Reducing the Size of Measuring Instruments, Concealing Them on Private Premises; Rice Stores Exploiting the Common People; Police Arrest Criminals and Send Them to Court for Strict Handling; Knowingly Violating the Law, Deep Concern from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Half-price foreign rice from the SMC continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo vessel "Taiyuan" and "Chongqing" arrived successively yesterday, each carrying 10,200 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, totaling 20,400 bags, and docked at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading.</p>
<p>Reducing the Size of Measuring Instruments, Exploiting the Common People</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that Qiu, a member of the Executive Committee of the Rice Merchants Association of the French Concession, who has a rice store at 181 Rue Muling (now Maoming Road), privately used reduced-size measuring instruments to exploit the common people. The authorities discovered this and filed a lawsuit according to law. The First Special District Court held a hearing on the case last Saturday, but Qiu did not appear in court. The First Special District Court has now issued another summons, scheduling a hearing for this Saturday. According to the police of the International Settlement, they went to Qiu's rice store on October 20 and discovered the reduced-size measuring instruments, which were immediately confiscated. They also questioned the shop assistants. It is said that Qiu then reported to the police headquarters, claiming that two Chinese detectives were attempting to extort money. However, after an investigation by detectives from the police department, it was found that the two detectives were innocent and there was no extortion. The Rice Merchants Association of the French Concession is a consulting group for the French Municipal Council on the matter of lowering rice prices. It is noteworthy that Qiu, as an executive member of the association, is using altered measuring instruments in his rice store.</p>
<p>Selling Fair-Priced Rice, Daring to Conceal It</p>
<p>The Renchang Rice Store at 22 Tongfu Road, opened by Wang Yingneng, was scheduled to sell fair-priced rice from the SMC yesterday. Common people lined up in the streets in the early morning, waiting in line. Sun Jianguo and Zhang Dehong waited from 7:00 AM until 11:00 AM, but the rice store claimed that the rice was sold out and closed the iron gates, stopping the sale. However, Sun and others saw three bags of white rice hidden in the store, which was a deliberate refusal to sell. When they negotiated, a shop assistant named Huang Hengde from Pudong claimed that this was first-class white rice, and the selling price was 180 yuan per bag, which caused a dispute. At that time, Deputy Head Detective Bai Fumin of the Chengdu Road Police Station happened to be patrolling and asked about the situation. Huang still claimed that the fair-priced rice was sold out. After inspection, it was found that the so-called three bags of first-class white rice were all fair-priced rice from the SMC. Huang, along with the three bags of rice, was taken to the police station. Detective Du Yunqi was assigned to investigate. Huang admitted that the rice was reserved by six employees of the store. Later, the accountant of the store, Zhu Xinghe from Jiading, was arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit according to Articles 12 and 31 of the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during the Emergency Period. The defendants hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Tao Wutu to defend them. The court ordered the two defendants Huang and Zhu to be remanded in custody, and the hearing was postponed to summon the shop owner and other shop assistants for further verification.</p>

<h3>North-China Daily News Resumes Operation; Normal Operations Resume Today</h3>
<p>All Chinese employees of the British-owned North-China Daily News went on strike on the morning of the 3rd of this month due to the failure to obtain a salary increase from the newspaper. Afterwards, the chairman of the newspaper, Mr. Arnhold, together with Taipan Davis and compradore Yang Wenqing, and the chairman of the newspaper's labor union, Yao Liren, summoned employee representatives Zhang Shaoliang for open and honest negotiations. A satisfactory solution was reached that evening, and work was resumed. However, because the resumption of work was late that evening, the newspaper only published eight pages, totaling two large sheets, yesterday. Normal operations will resume as usual today. The content of the salary increase method is as follows: (1) Those with original wages below 50 yuan will receive an increase of 100%; those with wages between 51 yuan and 70 yuan will receive an increase of 70%; those with wages between 71 yuan and 90 yuan will receive an increase of 55%; those with wages above 90 yuan will receive an increase of 40%;</p>

<h3>Telegram Registration Resumed between Shanghai and Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Since Fuzhou was once disturbed by the Japanese, telegrams between Shanghai and Fuzhou were temporarily interrupted. Now that the Chinese army has recovered the city, order has gradually been restored, and telegram registration has been resumed. According to a representative of the Great Eastern and Great Northern Telegraph Company yesterday, the company has received notification from the Fuzhou Telegraph Bureau that, starting today, telegrams sent to that location can be sent by using telegram registration as usual, without having to specify the full name and address of the recipient.

<h3>Loading and Unloading at Taikoo Wharf Suspended Briefly Yesterday Morning; Workers Demand Wage Increase; Contractors Agreed, Work Resumed Immediately</h3>
<p>The loading and unloading of cargo on various ships of the British-owned Taikoo Navigation Company, as well as the handling workers in the cabins and bottoms of the ships, are contracted by Changshun and Lianxin godowns. The number of workers is five to six hundred.</p>
<p>The wages were increased to 4 yuan per worker this spring, with the same wage for all-night work and a night snack of 5 jiao. Recently, the prices of various commodities in the city have repeatedly soared, so the livelihood of the common people has been unsustainable. Affected by the soaring prices, the workers recently proposed to the Changshun and Lianxin godown contractors to increase wages. The godowns contract with Taikoo, so the price increase for workers must also be requested from Taikoo. Because a senior British official of the company is ill in the hospital, it could not be resolved immediately, and it was scheduled to be discussed on the 10th. However, the workers did not agree to the delay and went on strike yesterday morning, causing the work at the Taikoo wharves on the Bund in the French Concession to be suspended. The Qiongzhou, Jinan, Taiyuan, and Chongqing vessels were docked at the wharves and were waiting to load and unload cargo. The company then ordered the two godown contractors,</p>
<p>The contractors in a hurry</p>
<p>Agreed to increase the workers' wages by 2 yuan to 6 yuan, with the same wage for night work, and the night snack was increased from 5 jiao to 1 yuan. The workers then expressed their satisfaction and resumed work in the afternoon. It is said that the contractors and the company will discuss the matter after the senior official of the company recovers from his illness, and there will be a good outcome.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials Are Difficult to Obtain, Sales Are Not Smooth; Various Industries Are Declining; Only Rubber Factories and Paper Mills Are Doing Well</h3>
<p>The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council issued its October report, stating that the output of various cotton mills last month was almost the same as in recent months. At the beginning of the month, due to the strong purchasing power of the Hong Kong gangs, the yarn market saw an increase. However, after the Jianghai Customs announced a ban on the transportation of cotton cloth on October 9, the selling price fell back. Finally, due to various speculative reasons, the yarn price rose again.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Increased by 70% in Three Months</p>
<p>It is estimated that since the implementation of the freezing order on July 26, yarn prices have risen by 75%. Unless the cotton products can be restored, the future of the yarn mill industry is not promising. Although various cotton mills have cotton stocks that can continue to be used, they will stop working unless the situation changes.</p>
<p>Candle and Soap Sales Have Clearly Weakened</p>
<p>The dyeing and bleaching industry is usually busier in the fall, but the work is more relaxed this autumn. Several rubber factories have obtained rubber raw materials from Siam. The season for manufacturing galoshes has now begun. A few rubber shoe factories that had been closed for several months have now reopened. The candle and soap industry originally had a market in the occupied areas, but now it feels that the purchasing power of the people in those areas has weakened, affecting sales. Moreover, raw materials are not easy to find, and even the fish oil from Japan has recently been restricted. The operating scope of sawmills is only half of their capacity.</p>
<p>Light Bulbs and Toys Are Lacking Raw Materials</p>
<p>Many light bulb factories have stopped working due to a lack of raw materials. Toy factories have few orders. Factories that manufacture tin toys have difficulty working due to a shortage of raw materials. Only larger factories that manufacture seasonings are operating. Paper mills are busy, and local sales are good and prices are high. The products of felt hat factories can still be exported, but the future supply of wool raw materials is currently uncertain.</p>
<p>Hardware Factories' Output Is Sluggish</p>
<p>Factories that use hardware materials encounter difficulties in finding raw materials. The copper scrap used in copper rolling shops is almost impossible to obtain. Electric motors and transformers cannot be exported at present. Electric fans are manufactured as usual and can now be shipped abroad. Enamel factories are only operating at one-tenth of their usual capacity. Only five cigarette factories in the western Shanghai area are operating.</p>
<h3>Lodger in the Cangzhou Hotel Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>The Cangzhou Hotel at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road in the Public Concession suddenly received a lodger at 4:00 PM on the 3rd of this month. He was wearing a beautiful suit, with a dark gray overcoat, and appeared to be in his twenties. The waiter led him to room 112, where he signed his English name T.K. Chang. He carried a gold watch and a gold bracelet. He paid 100 yuan in national currency. After the waiter brought tea and water, he immediately closed the door. In the evening, he ordered Western food from the waiter, and after eating, there was no movement all night. The next day at noon, the hotel routinely asked the lodger if he wanted to extend his stay. The waiter called for a long time but received no response, which aroused suspicion. They then tried to open the door and saw that the young man was lying on the bed, his eyes fixed and his mouth agape, barely breathing. An empty bottle of poisonous potion was found on the table, confirming that he had committed suicide by poison. The room service then reported to the front desk, which reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. He was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital in an ambulance, but it was too late, and he died shortly after. The body was then transferred to the coroner's office for examination. The police station is investigating his family and waiting to claim the body for funeral arrangements.</p>

<p>Ni Fusheng Murders with a Vegetable Basin. Xu Guishan Died. At the Xinhua Restaurant, located at 345 Guangxi Road, at 8 PM the night before last, paint merchant Wang Renji held a banquet for colleagues.

The restaurant urgently called an ambulance to transport him to the hospital for treatment, but he was pronounced dead. Upon receiving the report, the Lao Zha police department immediately ordered Chinese Detective Tao Genrong and Detective Zhang Decai to rush to the scene to investigate. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination, while Ni was arrested. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special District.

<h3>Girl Primary School Student Abducted on Route Fuli. Niece of Lei Yunsheng Pharmacy Owner, Abducted on the way home from lunch.</h3>
<p>Yesterday at about 1:20 PM, an abduction of a female primary school student occurred in front of 402 Route Fuli in the French Concession. Details are as follows: Yang Jinlin (26 years old) who is from Wuwuren, is currently operating Guangfeng Flour Mill at his hometown. He married Lei Yushi (26 years old) and has a daughter named Yang Xuan, who is now six years old. The Yang couple currently resides in Taiping Lane in Suzhou City. Their beloved daughter was sent to live with her mother's second maternal uncle, Lei Liangqing, in Shanghai at 9, Huanlong Villa, Lane 150, Huanlong Road. Lei is the co-owner of the famous Lei Yunsheng Chinese pharmacy in Shanghai. Lei sent Yang Xue to kindergarten at No. 4 Elementary School on West Axams Road since she is of school age. Each day, an old maid from the Lei family, Wang Ma (70 years old, from Suzhou) would take Yang to school. Yesterday morning, Yang went to her maternal uncle Lei Xian's house at 402 Route Fuli for lunch. Afterwards, Wang Ma accompanied her on the way to school when suddenly, four kidnappers appeared on the street outside, pointing guns at Wang Ma, threatening her not to make a sound. Another kidnapper immediately carried Yang into a getaway car No. 12163, parked on the side of Yuyue Road. The kidnappers sped away.

<h3>Central Animal Husbandry Experiment Station Selects Lingui as Site, Establishes Headquarters for Preparations</h3>
<p>(Guilin Dispatch) Since the establishment of the Central Animal Husbandry Experiment Station by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the station director, Mr. Cai Wuji, has traveled to Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, and other regions to survey possible locations. The location in Lingui, Guangxi, was found to be the most suitable, due to its flat, spacious land, abundant pasture, convenient transportation, and proximity to the Guangxi Livestock Conservation Institute, which would facilitate mutual assistance in operations. It is reported that Mr. Xu Zhenying, director of the Animal Husbandry Department of the station, has arrived in Guilin from Chongqing and is temporarily using the Guangxi Livestock Conservation Institute as a temporary office while constructing station buildings. Once completed, the station will move in, making the location the national center for animal husbandry.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments at National Central University Graduate School: Thirty-Three Earn Master's Degrees, Distributed Across Various National Institutions</h3>
<p>(Qujiang Dispatch) Since its establishment in the spring of 1935, the Graduate School of National Central University has existed for seven years. Thirty-three graduate students have earned master's degrees and are distributed across various universities and government institutions. The graduate school currently has three research institutes: arts, teacher training, and agriculture. The arts institute has two departments: Chinese language and literature, and history. The teacher training institute has two departments: education and educational psychology. The agricultural institute has two departments: soil science and agricultural and forestry plants. Since the Ministry of Education implemented restrictions on studying abroad, the graduate school has become an institution for cultivating high-level academic specialists and conducting advanced academic research in China. This year, the Ministry of Education has increased the school's funding for equipment and research by 120,000 national currency, demonstrating the Ministry of Education's high regard for the school's role in cultivating talent to replace foreign graduate schools. In August of this year, Zhang Yun took over as president of Central University. Cui Zaiyang, former dean of the university's Teacher Training College, was appointed dean of the graduate school and director of the Teacher Training Institute. Mr. Cui has officially taken office and has appointed Yang Chengzhi, former secretary of the graduate school, as director of the Arts Institute, and Chen Huanyong as director of the Agricultural Institute, actively developing the school's affairs. The graduate school's first graduate student entrance examination this year attracted a large number of applicants. However, in order to select top-level academics, the admission standards are extremely high. A total of six students have been admitted: Yin Huanxian, Wang Dajin, Chen Biheng, Wu Guiqing, Zhang Shoujing, and Zhang Bengeng. The admitted students come from National Central University, National Wuhan University, Daxia University, and Xiehe College, with two students from Sun Yat-sen University. It is reported that the graduate school, in order to provide opportunities for further education for university graduates with excellent abilities, will conduct a second round of admissions. The examination period is in mid-November. The number of students admitted to each department is not fixed. Admitted graduate students can receive a living allowance of 1,200 national currency per year. Detailed regulations can be obtained by writing to the school in Qujiang, Yunnan.</p>

<h3>Qian Xucang Creates New Type of Ball Sport: Round-Goal Ball Successfully Tested</h3>
<p>Combines the Advantages of Basketball and Soccer</p>
<p>Grand Demonstration Match to be Held Soon</p>
<p>Qian Xucang, the coach of the Shanghai Blue and White basketball teams, is an enthusiastic promoter of sports. Last year, he promoted Center Ball (Goal·Hi) and other sports with great enthusiasm. Recently, Mr. Qian has drawn on his experience of over ten years of dedication to sports to create a new type of ball sport, named Round-Goal Ball. It combines the advantages of basketball and soccer, and after much consideration and design, it has been successfully developed. He has built a court at Guoqiang Middle School on Aiwenyi Road and has begun experimental play. The rules have been compiled and printed, and those interested can write to the sports department of Guoqiang Middle School to obtain them. Mr. Qian plans to hold a grand demonstration match in the near future to draw attention from people in the sports world. It is expected that this exciting and intense Round-Goal Ball will become popular and add a new color to China's sports scene. The outline of the competition is as follows:</p>
<p>Brief Description of the Game</p>
<p>The Round-Goal Ball court is rectangular, slightly larger than a basketball court. It can be played indoors or outdoors. At each end of the court, there is a round goal. The court is marked with white lines to indicate the sidelines, end lines, center line, serving line, and goal area line. Each team consists of six players (the size of the large court and the number of players are the same as in soccer), one of whom serves as the goalkeeper. The other players can use their hands and limbs above the knees to pass, dribble, and throw the ball in any way (except that the goalkeeper can use their feet within the goal area) with the goal of getting the ball into the opponent's round goal. At the same time, players must closely defend against the opponent's players from getting the ball into their own team's round goal.</p>
<p>Meaning of the Round Goal</p>
<p>The goal is a regular rounded shape, 210 cm high and 360 cm wide, the same size as a small soccer goal. Because it is easier for players to aim when throwing the ball at the goal with their hands, the two corners of the goal are cut into semi-circular arcs of equal radius to reduce the difficulty of the goalkeeper's defense and to avoid irretrievable dangerous balls, thereby increasing the interest in the game.</p>
<p>Rules of the Game</p>
<p>The rules of Round-Goal Ball are compiled with reference to basketball and soccer. Actions such as dribbling, tapping the ball, throwing the ball, passing the ball, and jumping ball are similar to basketball. The regulations for violations and fouls are also based on basketball precedents. The penalties are divided into throwing in-line balls, corner kicks, goal kicks, and free kicks, six-meter balls, etc., which are similar to soccer. As for the rules for the goalkeeper and the goal area, they are slightly different from soccer. Among them, the restrictions on players entering the goal area are particularly strict. The goal area is semi-circular. Apart from the goalkeeper, any player who enters or touches the goal area line will be considered a foul and punished accordingly. The rules regarding game officials, game time, start of the game, temporary pauses, game terminology, wins and losses, violations, fouls, free kicks, corner kicks, six-meter balls, etc. have all been specially defined in the rules and are detailed without omission.</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<p>The movement of round gate ball is a combination of the rules of basketball and soccer, and the movement of the game is actually faster than soccer and simpler than basketball. There is no dull or bitter stage in the whole game, and it is always compact and full of interest. This is one advantage. Although there are many changes in offensive and defensive techniques, they are extremely easy to learn, unlike basketball or soccer where shooting or scoring cannot be done without a long period of practice. There is a big difference, so it is very easy to popularize. This is the second. The speed of movement is moderate, without the drawbacks of being too strenuous or too slow. It has an average development for all parts of the body, and it is suitable for the physical fitness of our country's people. This is the third. From the above observations, Round-Goal Ball is indeed the most ideal new type of ball sport in our country at present. Sports enthusiasts and sports experts will definitely be happy to promote it in order to popularize it. A recent photo of Mr. Qian Xucang, the creator of Round-Goal Ball.</p>

<h3>Serving Peanuts to Foreign Guests</h3>
<p>— Ping Ye</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Chongqing News: "Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie is scheduled to host foreign guests and Chinese and foreign journalists on the 5th, serving wonton noodles, dumplings, yellow wine, white wine, dried tofu, and peanuts. This is to use local materials, without spending foreign exchange."</p>
<p>We in Shanghai are accustomed to seeing those with idle capital eating and dressing only in foreign goods, spending foreign exchange at every turn. Some people even speculate and hoard goods when foreign exchange is tight, others buy foreign exchange and hoard foreign currency, and still others explore the black market, even rushing to the so-called "black black market," caring only about personal gain and not caring about pushing the majority of ordinary people into deep water. As fellow citizens, how can we not feel indignant?</p>
<p>We imagine that when dried tofu and peanuts are presented together at Wang's reception, the foreign guests present will pay their respects to the suffering Chinese nation. They will certainly not be as decadent, arrogant, extravagant, and dissolute as those in Shanghai teahouses, dance halls, restaurants, and banquet halls, where they are committing slow suicide.</p>
<p>Born in sorrow, dying in peace. Everyone who reads this news report, I think, should feel something. Moreover, at this time when the autumn wind is strong and severe winter is approaching, when we think of how many people are struggling for survival for the public in the ice and snow, and how many people are displaced from their homes, waiting for the arrival of light, enduring suffering and hardship, while the people in Shanghai are enjoying themselves at will, "behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine rot, while on the road, there are frozen corpses." Anyone with a little conscience will surely feel guilty. The winter clothing drive, the student aid movement, the women's relief movement—if people can turn their thoughts to these activities while eating shark fin and chewing on big dishes, they will surely lose their appetite and voluntarily transfer these unnecessary expenses to relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Familiar Queue</h3>
<p>— Fang Qiang</p>
<p>It seems like a long time since I've seen it—the long snake formation that starts at the entrance of the rice store. However, the situation in the past two days is even more "lively" than it was more than half a year ago—stretching from one end of the road to the other. The two or three hundred shops in between are of no consequence. Moreover, some queues even turn onto another side street and continue from there. Some even have these "long snake formations" lined up on both sides of the road.</p>
<p>As a result, the shops in this area seem to be under temporary "martial law" at their entrances. To get out, one has to take a big detour. Among them, the few shops next door to the rice store are the most "unlucky."</p>
<p>The police are busy, their batons constantly rising and falling in the air!</p>
<p>The clamor of voices spreads from here, far and wide. It is chaotic and noisy. Each person has a white number marked on them.</p>
<p>The moment when one is about to reach the rice store counter is the most tense, with each shift coming down. The faces of the "snakes" are all flushed.</p>
<p>The clerks inside the counter are sweating, and the sweat is dripping into the rice pile, but it is mixed into the rice grains and sold to the "generals" of the "long snake formation."</p>
<p>People who come to squeeze after a full meal are energetic. But by the time they buy the rice, their stomachs are hurting badly. But it doesn't matter. If they are hungry, they can take the squeezed rice to cook. But after eating, they have to come and squeeze again the next day. In this way, people's lives and time are all taken away by the rice.</p>
<p>However, there are also those who wait for two days and don't get a single grain of rice, so they have to drink plain boiled water!</p>
<p>On the road, there is much discussion, saying, "Buying rice from the Public Works Department at $117 per picul is even more enthusiastic than buying 'low-priced rice' before! Moreover, these rice buyers are clearly of a 'higher' class than the previous queue, and their clothing is much neater than before!"</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the real situation. But it is not surprising that the people who used to squeeze to buy low-priced rice have long gone to eat "pearl rice noodles" or "sweet potatoes"! This time, a new batch of "generals" has been replaced in the "long snake formation." That is a manifestation of "further progress," and we feel "fortunate"! It has even become "better and better"!</p>
<p>Who says this is "going from bad to worse"?</p>
<p>Fortunately, it is "right for our group of people to participate in the 'long snake formation'!" Just have the "bosses" who ride in cars hoard a little more, and put a little more in the warehouses, and that will be fine!</p>
<p>However, what I find strange here is, will such a miserable situation be allowed to continue to develop? … I dare not think any further!</p>
<h3>A Record of a Certain Student Not Being Employed</h3>
<p>— Huo Fubao</p>
<p>Ten Thousand in Savings, Ten Thousand in Capital, You Hurry Up and Dig for Gold for Me</p>
<p>In the morning, I found an advertisement in the newspaper:</p>
<p>"A certain bank wants to recruit a certain student, who must have a junior high school education, a clean background, and a strong physique to be qualified. If interested, please come to No. ×××, ×× Road, for an interview from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. on ×th to ×th of this month."</p>
<p>When I read it, my heart felt like it was about to jump out of my mouth. I quickly put on a blue cloth patched coat with white spots and headed towards ×× Road.</p>
<p>As a result, I arrived at my destination, on the third floor of No. ××, ×× Lane.</p>
<p>Walking to the entrance of the third floor, I saw the bank. The room was filled with a dark mass of people. Red silk banners hung all over the place, and silver cups and shields were displayed on the table, a dazzling array. Two writing desks and three sofas were arranged here. On the left, a black board more than ten feet long hung among the red silk banners, painted with the words "Wood Yarn" and "Red Hot" in white paint. Several telephones were installed on the table. An employee held a receiver, listening and reporting the market price to another employee writing on the blackboard.</p>
<p>When I entered, it was already past ten o'clock. There were already so many applicants. After writing my resume, I also joined this group. After half an hour, I managed to squeeze to the front and hurriedly grabbed a chair that had been sat on by several hundred applicants. As soon as I sat down, I immediately felt a kind of electric current running straight through my heartstrings. The face of the "examining committee" gentleman was cold and stern, and his eyes shone like searchlights.</p>
<p>After a few simple questions, he looked at my resume:</p>
<p>"Did you work at ×× Company before?"</p>
<p>"Yes! I was an employee at ×× Company."</p>
<p>"Then how much salary did you get per month?" "Including rice and housing subsidies, it was ×× yuan per month." I answered very cautiously.</p>
<p>"Then why did you resign?" I didn't expect him to ask me this.</p>
<p>"Because... the salary... wasn't enough." When I said it, it was very stiff, and I felt very red in the face. My heart was pounding. But the "examining committee" gentleman seemed to understand and said very crisply: "There are two ways to guarantee you in our bank: first, the shop that guarantees you must deposit 10,000 yuan in my bank and open an account as a deposit; second, our bank needs more capital, so please have the shop that guarantees you invest 10,000 yuan in shares."</p>
<p>I felt disappointed. My hot heart had been frozen. Where could a poor boy find a shop willing to pay 10,000 yuan as a guarantee fee? In the end, he gave me a word of encouragement.</p>
<p>"Your exam was very satisfactory, and you have a chance of being admitted. I hope you work hard to find a guarantor."</p>
<p>I stood up, nodded to the examining committee gentleman, and squeezed out of the crowd without looking back.</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Xiao Jiqing had to be humble and polite to him. The two sides then decided to have Begonia come to the theater from the next day. Before leaving, Qian Ruomo repeatedly instructed from the side, hoping that Xiao Jiqing would convey to the stage managers to give Begonia extra preferential treatment.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wu, I don't think this matter is very appropriate!" Walking out of the Red Stage Theater, Qian Ruomo stopped on the sidewalk, looking very embarrassed, and said, "Given your former reputation, it doesn't seem very good to be working in the martial arts field, no matter how difficult it is now."</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter. Little Danfeng even played a supporting role in her old age!" Begonia lowered his head and gave a bitter smile. "Anyway, it's the same as using strength to exchange for money, it's not a disgrace."</p>
<p>"Originally, I could have thought of a way for you in the box office," Qian Ruomo said as he walked, relighting the half-smoked cigar in his mouth that had been extinguished for a long time. "Unfortunately, after the war, the market here is getting worse every day, and the curfew is early at night. Now, almost all the box offices are closed. And this war is very strange. There are certainly those who fled into the concession from various places, but there are also many who fled out of the concession. Those rich masters are very confused, and even if they usually like to sing a few lines, they can't muster any interest at the moment." (254)</p>
<h3>A Tense Pantomime</h3>
<p>— Maple</p>
<p>Scene: Black Market</p>
<p>People: A portion of Shanghai residents</p>
<p>As the curtain opens, the clock strikes loudly. There is a commotion in the market. The "××× yuan" written on the blackboard suddenly causes a flurry of phone calls. The blackboard is then written with "××××× yuan." The phone rings again. The blackboard is written with "××××× yuan." Everyone in the market is stunned! In an instant, each takes out a bottle of "Lysol" from their arms, looks at each other, laughs, and drinks the "Lysol" in one gulp. Everyone lies down in the market.</p>
<p>Outside the market, there are sounds of "woo... woo..." All ambulances are dispatched. (Moving rewards to help raise funds)</p>

<h3>Random Notes from the Shou Chun Hu Studio</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>The Sensual and Tragic Story of Yu Tangchun</p>
<p>The play "Yu Tangchun" is based on a true story from the Ming Dynasty. In Hongdong County, Shanxi (this character is pronounced with a rising tone, similar to "tong"), there is a file of the case of Shen, née Pi, plotting to kill her husband, which has been preserved from the Ming Dynasty to the present. Yu Tangchun herself was falsely accused by Pi and forced to confess under torture. Imperial Inspector Wang Jinglong married her after acquitting her and was impeached and dismissed from office, returning to his hometown. This is similar to the plot of Leo Tolstoy's novel "Resurrection." Wang Jinglong was willing to give up his position as Imperial Inspector to marry the woman he loved, which is the same as the sacrificial spirit of the Duke of Windsor. This kind of thing is very interesting in the aspirations of human beings around the world. The play "Yu Tangchun" contains tragedy within its sensuality, so it has always been popular with the public.</p>
<p>In previous years, famous actresses who came to Shanghai would often perform this play on the first day because this play requires a lot of singing, has many good tunes, and can fully demonstrate the actress's skill, not only ensuring a large audience but also taking advantage of the auspiciousness of the actress wearing red clothes on stage, meaning that the actress is popular. Now that Cheng Yanqiu is coming, I heard that she will perform "Yu Tangchun" on the first day. I asked someone to buy tickets for me in advance, but unexpectedly, it was not my turn until ten days later. The ticket was booked early, so I went to see it at the scheduled time. Yang Baosen's "Zhu Lian Village" was already in the final scene of the duel between him and Zhou Dewei, so there is no need to comment on it. Yanqiu used to be known for her mastery of "Yu Tangchun." Her strength lies in her careful attention to the words and her deep, resonant voice, which is enough to express her sorrowful feelings. Now, because she has gained weight, her pitch is slightly lower than before, but her singing is still more fluent than anyone else. I also heard that her tunes are somewhat different from before. The rising tone characters have more low sounds (such as the characters "ren," "qing," and "men"), similar to the way old students of the Tan school sing entirely in the Hubei dialect. This kind of singing is Yanqiu's own creation. I feel that there is still a need to study this matter further, but due to space limitations, I will not discuss it in detail for now. Yanqiu's appearance is more charming than in the past, with a special kind of grace, and she is not less beautiful because of her weight. However, her waist seems to lack elegance, as if she had transformed her body. I don't know when she will be able to relax. I once saw a record in the Song Dynasty that said that a person was fond of Taoist arts and practiced diligently for many years and had formed a sacred embryo but had not understood the method of transformation. The immortal Liu Haichan sent a message asking how he would give birth after ten months of pregnancy. Yanqiu's belly is probably also a sacred embryo formed by cultivation? Just kidding!</p>
<p>In the past ten years or so, whenever I see the trial scene of "Yu Tangchun," the three high-ranking officials sitting majestically in the hall ask questions in a funny and frivolous manner, like child's play, not like high-ranking officials of the court, but like three crosstalk comedians. Recently, it has become even worse and more unruly. I always feel resentful. Now, watching the supporting actors that Yanqiu brought with her, Gu Jusun, Zhang Chunyan, and the other three, who played the Imperial Inspector, the Provincial Governor, and the Judicial Commissioner, respectively, infused the spirit of questioning and answering into the singing of "Yu Tangchun," their manner was gentle and disciplined, and their tone was restrained and slightly revealed, which is worthy of praise and promotion. I will now write it in large letters to tell the world that all good plays are arbitrarily ruined by vulgar actors. The task of correcting them lies with enlightened people. Drama is of great importance to popular education. I hope that the social intellectual class will study it more and take on the responsibility of improvement, so that all plays may have a day of glory.</p>

<p>Wu Sangui heard Zhang Cangqiu's questioning very sternly, so he replied with a serious expression: "Battalion Commander Zhang, you don't know that the enemy is numerous and we are few. The outcome of the battle cannot be predicted. I want to quickly stabilize the Ming Dynasty and wipe out the rebel bandits, so I temporarily abandoned the hatred with Manchuria and made peace with them, imitating Shen Baoxu's begging for help from a foreign country to stabilize the overall situation. This is also a temporary expedient measure. Fortunately, Dorgon has agreed to send troops, and the Qing army will enter the pass soon. We should quickly work together to attack the rebels and restore the capital. This is the best policy, which others do not know." Zhang Cangqiu said: "A good best policy. This humble general dares to say that this is the worst policy. We will definitely suffer from the Qing army in the future. The Qing army is our hereditary enemy. They have been eyeing us from outside the pass and are growing stronger. We are afraid that we will not be able to prevent them, how can we guide them into the pass and create an opportunity for them to occupy the Central Plains? We must rely on our own strength to attack the rebel bandits. The power of foreigners cannot be relied upon. If internal strife is quelled one day, foreign disasters will arise again. Isn't this making the land of China more vulnerable to future military disasters? Therefore, this humble general and others came to see you to ask the Prince of Pingxi to quickly write a letter to decline and delay their troops, and then think about a plan to eliminate the rebel bandits on your own. With the Prince of Pingxi's talent and the army's dedication, as well as the righteous armies rising up everywhere to defend the king, the rebel bandits are ultimately a mob. If they are lucky enough to win, they will be rampant for a while, but it will not be difficult to gradually destroy them. Therefore, this humble general believes that the rebel bandits are to be feared but not enough to be feared, and the Qing army is to be feared but cannot be approached. I hope the Prince of Pingxi will make a decision early and not leave regrets." Zhang Cangqiu spoke eloquently, with a righteous tone and a voice like a bell. Wu Sangui's face changed involuntarily. He was ultimately unhappy because Zhang Cangqiu and others refused to help him save Chen Yuanyuan, and Zhang Cangqiu's words today were very straightforward and often offensive, which made him even more annoyed.

<p>— Compiled by Putian Suxuezheng</p>
<p>The solution to the 358th game "Good Minister Pacifying the Country - Soliciting Answers" is disclosed below (Red goes first and draws)</p>
<p>Cannon 3 retreats 6, Pawn 5 advances 1, Chariot 6 retreats 3, Soldier 9 advances 1, Elephant 7 advances 9</p>
<p>Chariot 6 advances 4, Chariot 5 advances 1, Chariot 6 retreats 3, Soldier 9 advances 1, Elephant 7 advances 9</p>
<p>Soldier 9 advances 1, Elephant 9 advances 7, Soldier 9 moves horizontally to 8, Chariot 6 retreats 2, Chariot 5 moves horizontally to 6</p>
<p>Chariot 6 moves horizontally to 5, General 5 moves horizontally to 6, Chariot 5 advances 2, Soldier 8 moves horizontally to 7, General 6 moves horizontally to 5</p>
<p>Soldier 7 advances 1, Elephant 7 retreats 5, Chariot 6 advances 3, General 5 advances 1, Chariot 6 retreats 1</p>
<p>General 5 retreats 1, Soldier 7 advances 1, Elephant 5 advances 3, Chariot 6 advances 1, General 5 advances 1</p>
<p>Soldier 7 moves horizontally to 6, General 5 moves horizontally to 6, Chariot 6 moves horizontally to 2, Elephant 3 retreats 1, General 6 retreats (Variation)</p>
<p>Elephant 1 retreats 3, Chariot 2 moves horizontally to 3, Elephant 3 advances 1 (Correct Draw) Next Issue will Continue to Show the Variation</p>
<p>Variation: General 6 retreats 1, Elephant 1 advances 3, Chariot 2 retreats 3, General 6 advances 1, Chariot 2 moves horizontally to 8</p>
<p>Chariot 5 advances 1, Chariot 8 moves horizontally to 4, General 6 moves horizontally to 5, Chariot 4 moves horizontally to 6, General 5 moves horizontally to 6</p>
<p>Chariot 6 approaches 1, Elephant 3 retreats 5, Chariot 6 retreats 2, Elephant 5 retreats 7, Chariot 6 moves horizontally to 3</p>
<p>(Elephant is dead, Red wins) The list of correctly guessing names is on the left: (All guessed correctly) Bao Hanliang, Tao Ziwen, Wu Ming. (Guessed the correct draw) He Yulin, Lu Yukang, Mao Wenlong. The above six gentlemen will be slightly rewarded and mailed today. Wu Youqing Qi The Black side's response in this game was slightly flawed, resulting in a Red victory. Therefore, after Black's Elephant 5 advances 3, it can retreat 1 and retreat 3, and then advance 1 three times, which is the correct draw. In the variation, the Elephant advances 3 again, causing Red's Chariot 2 to retreat 3 to kill, and then moves horizontally to 8 to suppress the sleeping Elephant, forcing Black to move the Chariot on the fifth rank. Advancing 1 is walking horizontally to 6, then Red's Chariot moves horizontally to 5 to occupy the center and win again, for the research of fellow enthusiasts. (Editor)</p>
