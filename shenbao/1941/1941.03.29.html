<p>社評</p>
<h3>告囤積居奇者</h3>
<p>自米糧把持於囤戶之手，暗盤貼價，距躍曲踊，迭漲無已，煤球繼之；目前洋米每市石已屆一百十元有零，煤球乃至十二元一市担。他如熟水每杓由一分而為二分，切麵每斤由三角餘陸續高至六角，凡此數者，尙有所謂平價煤平賣粉相供給，以資調整，然而便宜能有幾何，抑且非一般人所得共享。此外各物，聞風響應，高起百分之二三十不等。回憶去年春季，物價曾暴漲，亦以米價導之於先，各物續漲於後，今年又如此。而當業中人每以諉之於囤戶，謂囤戶之作崇也。言屬不誣，然經售於囤戶，者代囤戶脫手者，無一而非業中人為之居間，囤戶罪無可逭，業中人其可恕耶。彼此交相為利，屢屢盤剝，且高增利潤，向之作一分利者，今則非四五分利不脫手，於是大利在握矣。</p>
<p>牟利自是一般人之欲望，不必深責，我人祈禱者：一，多數人各獲其應得之利；二，獲利者不害他人而克享其利。今則不然，不但獲利者僅社會之極少數人，不但少數人貽害多數人，且此獲利之少數人亦未必能終享其利。蓋按之至理，利害如形影之相隨，未有盡利而無害。晋朝有石崇者，被收赴東巿，方嘆曰，一奴輩利吾家財。」收者答日：「知財致害，何不早散之。」崇不能答。然而崇有生之日，但知財產豐積，室宇宏麗。絲竹盡一時之選，庖膳窮水陸之珍，焉知有身死家亡財產蕩盡之日。此無他，多財最足以召禍，亂世允甚。此說雖似陳腐，然通古今而不變。即就今世之經濟理論言之，所謂利者，必須本利歸來，方為實益；若有貨在手，貨價飛漲，猶是鏡花水月。即使盡如囤貨者所期望，在最近之將來，物價只有漲而無跌，故小虞折閱；而不思消費者之消費，無論其為米，為布，為油鹽，為蔬菜，雖曰不可一日缺，然以價格高貴，購買力薄，於是望洋興歎，相率裹足，如是則囤貨之利又安在哉，此其一也。公衆生活有不能維持之勢，飢民將蠭起為患，治安有阽危之虞。乃有不得不採取應急處置，為公用而徵發日用所必需之物品，平價出售，安定民生，此在今日雖未施行，然囤戶長此作惡，物價長此騰貴，時局長此混亂，則又焉知不有此一日，此其二也。今之所以多囤貨者，一則為其上漲無止境也，二則各物皆漲，惟有銀行存款之利息獨減，於是較有活動之能力者，寗願集其資力，小有財者小所囤，大有力者大量囤，故無物不有囤積，亦無物不見上漲，甚至有利用低利之存款，作巨大之囤積，亦即以公衆之資，危害公衆：如此辦法，可一而不可再，可暫而不可久，為日稍久，必為事理所不容，於是亟謀出脫，物價驟貶，一般囤戶之利益又安在，此其三也。囤戶多利用金融界之資源與倉庫，一旦金融業對於囤貨押款稍事甄擇，量為裁抑，並自身然於囤積範圍之外，可卜物價雖以種種原因，縱不能如舊時之牛準，而亦決難維持今日之昂貴，此其四也。貪狠者，漠視所謂法律制裁，誠以法律有時而窮；允漠視所謂社會制裁，誠以社會如散沙，似無力量；然社會制裁病在緩慢耳，及其一朝發動，則無形中具有不可抗之極大力量；預料今後因囤貨而發不義之財，乃致在上海立足不住者，必將漸多，此亦所謂社會制裁也；揮淚而行，財又何益？此其五也。或曰，不有囤積，上海一切供應品之儲積，當無如是之豐富，焉知不恐慌更甚於今日，此其意固以為賴有此囤積耳。夫所謂豐富也者，非謂倉棧儲積之　　富也；棧儲之貨固可貴，而市上仍缺少流通，市價猶暴騰不已，此在消費者視之，豐富與不豐富等。蓋貿遷以覓正當之利潤，是商人之商業；囤積自肥，以窘社會，是奸商之罪惡：二者逈異，不容併為一談而曲諒奸商。今則各種貨物之來源未絕，而囤戶挾其雄厚之資力，，不但將所居積者相率掯持不為售，且將陸續所新到者，又席捲於倉庫之中，不以應市；若是而謂終得不受制裁，必為明白事理者所不信也。貪狠者利用暗無天日，姑母謂天日即見光明，抑暗無天日之下，財貨何嘗獨得保障，言念及此，不應省悟耶。</p>

<h3>英相謂南覓得國魂　艾登或將至南一行</h3>
<p>倫敦　英首相邱吉爾昨日在保守黨年會中發表臨時演說稱、南國已「覓得其國魂」、新政府或將拒絕加入軸心公的、邱吉爾又稱、英國之承認、即將根據此種拒絕、「凡遭攻擊時起而保衛共祖國者、例如土希等國、英皆將就能力所及以援助之、」（二十八日國際社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　首相邱吉爾昨日宣稱、渠相信南斯拉夫將背棄三國盟的而保衛其國境、邱吉爾係在歡宴新任美國駐英大使韋南特席上發言、集稱「經過之情形、余雖不知、且任何人亦不能對於任何事件確信無疑、但余以為有理由可期望南斯拉夫政府將背棄前日（星期二）所簽訂三國公的、並將防禦其國境被侵」云、邱吉爾首相除應允給與南斯拉夫以各種可能之援助外、並允給土爾其以援助、渠稱「如土爾其被侵、吾人將盡力給以援助」云、在塲諸人聞此言、鼓掌甚久、以表示贊同、邱氏面色灰白而帶笑容、繼續宣稱、渠常靦覥不欲說明英國之戰爭目的、但渠相信如民主國獲得勝利、則世界上可有一種電力氣氛、使其趨向於更擴大之社會團結、及正義較正平時數十年中所曾獲得者為多、當吾人目覩英勇之塞爾維亞及南斯拉夫人之靈魂、為其懦弱卑怯之統治者所簽字出賣與以前曾壓迫彼等、以後復將剝去彼等之生命與獨立之人時、余人皆覺傷心、如南斯拉夫之新政府廢棄三强公的、則英國將承認該新政府、並將縱力援助保衛其本國領土之民族、一如吾人現時之援助希臘、如土爾其被攻擊時、吾人亦將與以同樣之援助、當吾人所有各工廠巳交出其出產而大工廠亦巳產生新武器時、吾人將較現時更為堅强、但吾人仍每日加强」云、重行提及英國將盡力給與援助時、邱氏謂渠確信羅斯福總統、對於此種給與乃自由而戰者之慷慨情感、亦將同樣受感動、「而依照美國法律及憲法、允其是以偉大之民主領袖資格、渠必須使全國向前、余確信渠必將向塞爾維亞人寄其全部之同情也、固此現時吾人有充分之理由希望戰爭能獲得結果、最後之結果、或尙遙遠、但或亦較吾人所估料者為近、汝等實不能知之」云、邱氏復向韋南特言、謂韋氏宴後、可重新明瞭英國決意與偉大之美國民主協同前進、直至打開出路方止、邱氏復力言英國之勞資最堅强之組織聯合、歡迎韋氏、實係値得注意者、此或由於美大使常有其高尙之傳統、亦或由於吾人所參與之戰爭之重心、而最要者、蓋由於韋氏本人特別之個性及其對於聯合世界勞工及工業運動所盡之服務云、韋氏亦在席上發言、將民主與獨裁作一比較、渠稱英國政府在緊急之際、需要更大之權力、以為大衆謀利益時自由之民衆、即自動給政府以力量而非由政府以獨裁之命令强取、民主國現正組合力量、以對抗一敵人、此敵人係中世紀之懲罰制度而配以近代之機械及技術云、在席上邱氏及韋氏互相譽揚、（二十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>匈京　此間昨日未經證實消息稱、因南斯拉夫政變之結果、英外相艾登或將赴南國京城一行、官方對於南斯拉夫之發展、保留不作批評、而維持靜觀之態度、至於艾登氏目前之行蹤、無所聞悉云、（二十八日合衆電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　國務幫辦韋爾士昨招待新聞記者時聲稱、南國如被迫抵抗侵略、則美國允予以完全之援助、駐南美公使已奉命照會南政府、吿以南國政權之變更甚為美國所歡迎、視為、愛自由者所可自賀之事、羅斯福總統於此得依照租界案、為美國國防起見、以有效的物質上援助給予欲保持其獨立與完整以抗侵略之國家云、章爾士又表明南國在美資產本週宣布凍結者今可解放、（二十八日路透電）</p>

<h3>德國向新政府詢問　是否維持前訂公約</h3>
<p>柏林　可靠消息、德政府昨要求南斯拉夫新政府、速即表明是吾贊助前總理及外長所簽訂之加人同盟公的、又據德政府通訊社報吿、巴爾格勒（南斯拉夫京城）司令司台普漢尼洛發出布吿、促人民聽從市政府指揮、保持秩序及安寗、塞維安民軍團體宣布效忠新王彼得第二、（廿八日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>南仍願與德義兩國　維持三方友好關係</h3>
<p>南國京城　南國新政府、昨晨通知德義兩國公使、南國亟願與德義兩國、維持友好、（二十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　軸心國方面對於南隊昨日之發展、保持緘默、頗堪注意、據德方通訊社消息、柏林有資格方面警稱、截至昨午為止、彼等未接「關於南國事件之確實消息」、故柏林官方與半官方面對於此事、均不表示態度、又羅馬無綫電臺廣播稱、義官方對南國京城事件、亦絕不表示意見、義官方本接南國京城義公使館之電話報告云、（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>瑞士京城「瑞士通訊社一頃發出羅馬消息稱、南斯拉夫國發生政變、幼主彼得二世親自臨政之後、義國政界人士、尙無何種反應顯欲等待消息、以期洞悉南國政變之眞相、各報雖一致登載彼得二世所發言人民書、但未加以評論、僅「義大利日報」載有一文、略謂「南國施維戈維區內閣決定加入德義日三國盟約之後、英國乃不惜出以最有力之一張紙牌、務使南國入盟以後之政局發生重大困難、此事殆甚明顯」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>作戰力量久而彌堅　中國非武力能征服　倫敦泰晤士報論遠東時局　認松岡外交決難有所成就</h3>
<p>倫敦　「泰晤士報」今日載專論、題曰「蔣介石之抗戰」、推料日外相松岡訪問莫斯科與軸心國都城之可能的結果、謂日本現決心自三國盟的求得若干利益、松岡駐歐時、將端力親目視察日本將來之行動、應否為在亞洲南進、而與希特勒春勢攻勢同時並舉、或日本是吾將使中國受若干犧牲而脫離軸心、</p>
<p>松岡歐行　頗多揣測</p>
<p>中國對於松岡此行繼多揣測、一般人士相信松岡將首與蘇聯訂成貿易協定、於是將舉此為其此行在外交上之第一步勝利、而以此為締取更入而包羅更廣之政治協定、即互不侵犯協定之梯階、互不侵犯協定無論有何實際的價仙、但該協定之簽定可令日本將現束縛於滿洲之關東軍的三十萬人之大部分、調供南進之用、松岡日將力迫莫期科停止以軍需供給中國、而無疑的將以最近中國之國共磨擦為共進讒之資料、東京慾望較者、且希望新四路軍事　成國民黨中國之分裂焉、松岡駐柏林時、必將親自視察軸心國之獲勝機會、因租借案巳開啟美國軍需源源輸入英國之門戶、是吾仍如去秋之有望、如華對於此卽感覺滿意、則將商定日本南進冒險行動與希特勒久佈之攻勢同時並舉之日期、且因軸心國與日本距離甚遙、此舉將需技術上之合作、以消除因此發生之重大障碍、及防杜美國在大西洋與太平洋出而干涉焉、最後對於亞洲戰利品之如何分配、當不致不作一種商定也、如松岡對於軸心國之勝利感覺懷疑者、則必將不願以日木帝國作孤注之一擲、而冒險行動以效過索用尼之鑄成大錯、於是或將向倫敦與華盛頓暗示日本準備脫離三國盟的、而不使協的幽與美國有何犧牲、唯以若干犧牲加諸中國、總之、松岡決心以僅使軸心一方面獲益之三國盟的為要挾物、無論作此讓步或作他讓步、必使日本獲同等利益而後已、</p>
<p>日本南進　聲東擊西</p>
<p>今日所發生之問題、為日本如攻擊新加坡與荷屬東印度、則中國將乘機與日本媾和乎、其答語為重慶巳切實聲明決不出此矣、在華人之心目中、日本之南進僅為聲東擊西之舉、日本之永為中國危脅、毫不因以消除、日本之中要目的廠為征服中國、無一日能忘懷者也、東京蓄意兩國併成一大經濟集團、則在軍略上較諸防守如長練屏於數千哩之海洋上、北自堪察加端起、南迄達爾文港止之諸島嶼、為功遠易、中國數百萬力哩沃腴之土地、可以供給日本所需之糧食與原料、其四萬五千萬人民則可予以利用、而使耗其精力血汗於日人之工業、征服中國且可使日貨日本獲一為利無量之巿塲故南進之舉、不過圖將中國暫置入冷藏間待砍用之時再取出之耳、且日本旣征服越南馬來荷屬東印度、則俟南進大功完成之時、即可獲得新氣力、重行攻擊中國大陸、中國於是將完全孤立、日人橫跨越南與泰國、可以安坐而截斷緬甸公路之交通、並堵塞澳洲援軍開至近柬之大道、直接影響蘇彝士運河與地中海之印度洋局勢、至是將使中英兩國寸步難行矣、緬甸公路今為中國中要命脈、外國供給品可以藉是輸入國內、內地產品可以藉是輸往國外、而新加坡者保衛緬甸之堡壘也、另一重要經濟點、而為人所罕知者、厥為中國不可見之輸出亦將因是大受危脅矣、</p>
<p>華僑愛國　踴躍輸將</p>
<p>越南泰國馬來荷屬東印度非列賓之華僑、估計不下八百萬人、若輩對自由中國復興與工業化所投之資、為數之巨、巳達八萬萬元、而若輩對祖國災難所供獻之捐款、曾使政府得將指定以供賑濟之款、用以購置軍需、其數的佔中國軍費總額四分之一有奇、日人若佔據或控制上述諸地、則此輩華僑均將不能託足而全數被逐、其產業將全被攫奪、於是中國源源收入之捐款與外滙均將吿止、匪特經濟上之因素受危、而精神上之種種因素亦將陷於危境矣、中國現進行團結抗、無論犧牲若何、不達勝利目的不已之政策、其奮鬥也匪特為自己之生存計、且為抗拒暴力治制以衛法律秩序計、羅斯福總統近發偉人之演說時、曾言及服從僅能以力强施、但忠誠則異於是、此由內衷發出、此種內衷為明白之事實、而涵有古代之觀念、今日之英國希臘中國美國皆如是也、並謂中國應付事實之能力、與夫誹笑現實主義、常為彼等哲學之一部分者、今已在日人壓力之下、加入軍事效率之新觀念矣、</p>
<p>中國大軍　五百萬衆</p>
<p>華人向有「好人不當兵」之傳統習慣、故其軍隊完全無新時代之訓練、但今日已練成大軍五百萬人、其一部份已成善戰之游擊隊、彼等且創成製造武器之工業、且得有非常將才之蔣介石將軍為其總司令、此外尙有卓著戰績之指揮數人、日本之開戰也、謂皇軍將出游行、歷時三月可返、（對華戰事至今仍為不宣而戰、稱之為「偶爾事件」也、）但至中國後、奮鬥三年半有餘、而仍毫無結果、當漢口陷落時、日本征服中國之軍事階段即告終止、於是靜待與磨擦戰鬥乃吿開始、中國僅賴其人口之盛、已足為應付日本最激烈閃電戰之强有力的利器、中國之偉大人力與其無窮之天然利源、今經利用後、巳發生至可驚人之效果、中國之古代歷史與文化、實使其領袖與人民獲得勇氣力量與遠見、英美蘇聯增予之援助、現漸增强中國之防務中國現能靜待勝利之至、共總司令始終抱近衛欲擊至中國屈膝之幻想永無實現日之觀念、目首都陷落時、中國孤立無援、當時倩勢至為佔危、然德使陶德曼勸喩蔣介石與日媾和、仍失望而罷、今日德國若再圖調解、亦必失敗無疑、</p>
<p>日方夏懼　與日俱增</p>
<p>日人對於戰事前途之憂懼、今巳無法自掩、近衛於本年一月間、首承認和平之迢迢無期、三月間田中將軍曾吿議會、今無庸以武力搗碎重慶政府、惟須在佔領區從事經濟發展、於是可置重慶於弗顧云、日本今在中國從戎之士兵、大的仍有一百萬人之多、死傷者大的尙逾此數、其軍隊之給養大半出諸當地、聞一九四〇年其軍糧百分之六十奪於華人之手、而付以不能購物之軍用券、致佔領區人民有成餓莩之虞、日軍縱獲此便利、然仍受害重重、因日軍控制佔領區之貿易、而拒絕付出與佔領區「合作」之經濟價値之故、由中國輸日之棉花已低落四分之三、致其戰費無從彌補、中國因遭兵災、及因日本故意破壞沿海與中部各省之財產、故其所受損失當然遠過於日本、事有可異者「南京政府」所轄之地雖為中國至富之數省、而其政費仍仰給於日軍所經營之毒藥貿易、華軍之退入內地、文化界與工界亦隨以俱往、學生之赴內地者、現仍照常受課、行政人員多出自彼等遠地曾經改革之學校、至於學生小遠千里而適內地者、實因為日兵拘獲恢即有被殺之虞、寗波有機器工人七十名、曾以手車拖二百噸重之機器、經過重慶山路跋涉多月、雖時受日機之轟炸卒達目的地、而將機器配合重事工作、中國工業合作社即由此輩健之强工人團體組織、現共有大小不等之社二萬所、此種愛國精神、實為中國之新現象、</p>
<p>日德狡謀　決難逞志</p>
<p>中國幅員廣大人口衆多、因此天賦之厚、遂使完全軍事佔領為不可能、且可騰出數百萬人執戈衛國、數百萬人為國生利、凡此皆為精神上軍略上政治上經濟上致懸之因素、中國決不為恫嚇所懾服、或入陰謀的和平提供之圈套、蔣介石將軍嘗有言曰、「革命的中國不可克服之精神不知有所謂戰敗「字」云、此種明白之眞理旣經揭布、而人皆置之心頭矣、駐重慶之納粹外交人員曾切實聲明、德國尙未承認「南京政府」、因希特勒不欲將中國交與日本云、此雖使日本大為不懌、而德國仍有此舉者、蓋德人暗示與其喪失生命、不如斷一肢之為智也、此種狡謀將不能成功、中國決不致受惑與日本媾和、而使其敵軍得以全力在南海進攻也、觀於中國之準備在此爭衡中盡其充分之責任、故松岡希圖犧牲中國而脫離軸心之謀、決不能成功、此為顯而易見者也、（廿八日路透電）</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米貼價仍在回漲　小絞米又見四千元之貼價</h3>
<p>洋　米通日到頭擁擠、存底逐加、即以近週中到銷與轉口軋計之下、各棧存底仍加有四五萬包、故米價之漲、完全被投機操縱、大戶抬價，盲從爭買所致、蓋邇日雖有各淪陷區去化、及日商收買碎米、然其總數不及新到三分之一、本街等實銷亦祗二分之一、而棧下加增與未上綫者亦有三分之一、但米市塲仍在散佈流言、傳說香港輪運有兩艘被某方攔去、及建原洋行前所拋出之二月份大批期貨有到期不解之說、以致實銷與心思交易、相互競賽、大戶客囤乘機居奇形勢混沌復起澎湃、各貨暗盤貼價突飛猛漲、一躍恒有二三百元、若白身小絞自初即開四千元、三千九百元、迄中巿曾達四千一二百元、中關自一千七百元達三千九百元、一號西貢三千四百元、升至三千六百元、二號西貢自三千五百元至三千八百元、嗣後實銷漸懈、而浮戶紛紛出籠、形勢轉平、繼之大戶亦多湧出、一時供過於求、貼價回落一二百元、結果白身小絞貼四千元、中關三千八百元、一號西貢暹羅貼三千五百元、次至三千二三百元、二號西貢貼三千五六百元、火絞貼三千五百元、東京砶尖貼三千六七百允、碎尖貼三千二百元、較之前市上午猛提五六百元、下午提三百元、每擔計算陡漲四元之巨、是誠出意料之外、皆由於米市塲放任所致、</p>
<p>厚　薄粳等國米、因洋米暴漲、致貨主心思頓堅、一律喊高脫售、本鄉店胃進意淡薄、故價雖提高、尙難與洋米並駕齊驅、僅回升一一元而已、若常幫斛見特粳且以底盤較昂、未能再提、猶乏榮辱、仍開百二十四元、百二十二三元、崑山斛見高粳則開百二十元、次至百十二元、靑角斛見薄稻開百十三叫元、原包悉無做開、</p>
<p>糯　米際斯他貨一致趨昂、去路頓亦轉廣、不獨零胃多所採納、而大戶又出手吸收、將懷貨者遂都扳俏、喊聲在飛、結果見增三元左右、香港白元開高自百零八元、次至百零三元、糯菉九十七元、次至碎九十元左右、</p>
<p>洋　米源源而來、太古公司漢陽輪、由香港運來一萬二千八百六十三包、昨日傍晚到埠、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、渣華公司芝沙力號輸、有大批洋米運來、昨晨抵滬停靠浦東蓋烟囱碼頭起卸、確數容探明續報、（祖）</p>
<h3>麵粉到銷兩旺</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日洋粉巿况、仍趨昂挺、査來源方面、大批到貨業巳扺埠、如金龍牌坎粉及汽船西牛牌等不下四十萬包之夥而到貨雖多，均被囤戶所把持、不肯賤脫、蓋目下國外定貨合價每包須三十一元以上、而巿價尙在三十元進關，是以投機作客、興意頗濃、堪稱到銷兩旺、澳粉鐘樓脾價父昂至卅元零三四角、金龍牌亦須三十元以上、在米價漲風中、市塲流通籌碼稀少、市面恐一時不易回落云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况　依然挺立、高杜麥喊價五十元以上、但無　式做開、日廠門巿收貨亦殊寥落價在四十五六元之間、每日收額僅一二百包云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆油一跌即漲</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市依然被投機操縱、市面先小後大、原因晨初浮多承上日之疲風、頗有斬出、不論期現一致回落一二元不等、後因大多頭（花紗幫）堅守勿出外、反來加碼吸收、故壁壘愈堅愈硬、且一般助風作浪之輩、乘機拉推、致以後市行悄反突　出上日巿價、計現油漲一元外、期油漲三元左右、成交大有廠油二百担、價山一百零三元、升至零五元、大連油一百二十桶、價為一百四十元至四十二元、訂四月上交一千五百桶、價為一百三十九元五角、步砌至四十四元七角半、訂四月下交二千桶、價為百四四十二至四十六元五角、花生油亦自平轉硬、行情又提一二元、做開烟台生油三十件、價為一百十九元、又聽油四百聽、價為一百五十九元至六十元、及江北本坊聽裝油五百聽、價為一百五十五元、</p>

<p>港電續來吐出</p>
<p>後市初開、美平英續微硬、現貨與本月一辦士二六五六二五均可結得、乃因港電續來吐出故也、不久又聞匯豐售予美行現美匯五元三四三七五、嗣後投機家忽來補本月份美匯空頭、致五元三四二七五一度難結、惟迄收盤、英金吿三辦士二五、美匯為五元三四三七五、四月份英金三辦士二三四三七五、美匯五元三一二五、結果比上日現期英均長〇一二二五、美俱硬〇六二五、</p>
<p>港市概無變動</p>
<p>香港二十八日（週五）電、今晨匯巿開盤平定，英美日各匯俱無變動、申匯現貨降一元半、為四百六十二元半、（昨收為叫百六十四元）、九時二十分申匯現貨續降一元、為四百六十一元、十一時三十分吿平、各滙概無變動、</p>
<p>津電匯市報軟</p>
<p>天津二十八上（週五）電、今晨匯巿開盤吿緊、倫敦電匯軟〇九三七五、為一辦士四〇六二五、紐的電匯亦縮一二五、為五元五九三七五、申匯升三元、為九十四元、「聯鈔」暗盤猛昂三元一角二分、為六十四元半、</p>
<h3>金市利空　有撳無抬</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、繼續盤下、數次退過六千五百元關邊、因外匯報鬆、滬西幫不斷出籠、各方人心均帶軟化、證券號（益大祥興永）滙豐商（大豐）賣勢下、散戶大都空頭、有撳無抬、故由晨開後虛抬至六千五百五十二元、復愈盤愈低、午後退至六千五百〇五元、不意美滙止鬆、忽又納回、空方急起補進、證券號（同康永）銀號（恒記）力進、曾抬起四十元、終尙續小三十九元、收後美德有衝突傳說、突降至六千五百十八元、全日交易共二三萬兩、掉期（三月轉入四月）賣方貼出買方仍的五十元、現金上午未做開、下午永豐餘售予北慶雲二十兩、照期交價高二百元、約軋小七十元、飾金關金等仍平、</p>

<h3>證劵　丙戌多頭拉抬</h3>
<p>公　價暗盤、昨市况繼續趨堅、惟甲丁兩種未有進退，丙戊兩種檯面、大都多頭抬之頗力、畸形繼堅、尙非正式之上落、因市塲交易頗淸、做收盤時頗易為有輩所利用、正式漲跌、仍有待於環境消息之優劣、目下情形、正在醞釀、未來變化必鉅、非可過抱樂觀也、昨日交易、順昌獨吃戊種已數日、信孚·新華·同康·亦有少數吃胃、午後協興元·三開·鴻大·協大·皆有買進、賣方有聯益·恒康·久孚·上下午均有賣出、餘如大通·信亨永·敦餘·聯和·同興·厚大·絡續均係賣出、市價在收盤時仍被多方抬起、結果多數漲起一角牛至三角、甲丁兩種水有高低、成交數目的計仍祇一百六七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市難振</h3>
<p>昨日紗巿仍難振作、實銷旣乏躉額、多頭又思了結，市盤乃吿下挫、加以滙市趨鬆、金價下疲、大戶活動力銳减、檯面乏勁、賣氣頗盛、晨開幸有空方稍補、首盤尙在一千三百九十四元、最高達九十五元、嗣以客銷未聞振作、散多亦起了結，市盤逐漸下降至一千三百八十四元、為全日最低價、橋面顯現供過於求之象、繼因乘低不乏吸戶、但亦屬少數、乃又回至一千三百八十八元收盤、比上日再跌五元許、全日有十元許起伏、同業皮球交易尙達四千七百六十包、雜牌紗由港幫進一百六十八包、內地進二十包、價亦下跌三元、雙馬廣幫祇進一百廿包、價為一千三百十元、比廠單賤去七十元、今日有紗十五件運厦門、五百四十件運香港、茲將全日各幫做開紗額列左、</p>

<h3>棉市靜寂</h3>
<p>昨日現棉交易靜寂、市價大致平定、廠家以紗銷不振、未聞採購、同行供求亦少、祇做開一筆、行情列左、</p>
<p>美彭家坡　一九·〇　同業二〇〇件</p>
<p>印蘭貢花　二〇五·〇　同業二〇、件</p>
<p>紐的棉市、因歐州巴爾幹情勢急轉直下、及華盛頓轉來消息利於多頭、於是人心煥發、市况活潑、結果收盤價格、較之上日的漲四五磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因歐州出口商售出而跌、旋因大戶支持略有平復、最後又因棉化將停止運往中國之謠傳而冉跌、結果收盤價格、除亞姆拉漲叫羅比外、其餘均跌二、羅比不等、父預測今日開盤尙平、僅看高一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、尙覺滿意、連日廠方與同業均有購進、故市况活潑而又堅定、市價挺進二三元不等、唯因一般執有手貨者、並不急於脫售、而同時廠方仍無大量採購、故總計成交之數不多也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　貨底厚薄不同　布價堅疲互異</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢平和、月底到期貨頗有轉賣、同業納胃仍健、故市盤依然堅定、客銷零星續而不斷、各貨以貨底厚薄關係、互有堅疲、白貨粗布輕車磅均提升，加起每疋一角至五角、粗斜出品缺乏、大同飛鴻牌開出四十五元、較前加起五角、細布細斜價無榮辱、漂染布價亦鮮變動、本街成交各布五百餘件、浙閩幫辦粗細布藍布白餘件、粵滇幫辦細斜粗布斜士林布等二百餘件、今日有疋頭二十件運復門、九百五十件運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價繼長增高</h3>

<h3>廿薯　（續二十八日）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>廿薯和番藝有什慶分別呢，徐文定公說的最好？「蓀有二種：一名「山药，」圖廣固有之，其一名「番药。」……兩種莖葉多相類，但山药援附樹乃生，番药蔓地生；山药形魁壘，番药形圓而長。其味，則番药甚廿，山药為劣耳！「這種鑑別，可謂細人毫髮！以前所引證的書，稱廿薯「如拳，如斡，如鵝卵，如鷄卵，」全是魁壘的註脚，同番薯的「圓而長』絕不相同；而我國北方家喩戶曉的「紅薯；」有的肌肉黃而津液多者，它的色香彷彿蜂蜜：有的中心白而澱粉多，北方所「菊花心」者，它的風味直駕良鄕栗子而上之！水分過多而滋味淡泊的廿薯，那裏敢同它相比呢？</p>
<p>雖然，廿薯番薯固是一種植物；至於它們怎麼鬧了意見，以致分家而另立門戶，各奔前程？這種問題設如法國Coutiere所云：這不是一個簡單的「植物」起源問題，而是世界「人類」的起源和分佈問題！因為這種植物，不特在亞洲美洲大陸上已有很悠久的歷史，就是在太平洋諸島嶼上，它的蹤影也到處可見。允其是新西蘭島上文化最高的摩利斯人（Maoris），他們根據自古的傳聞，以為番薯是和他們有生俱來的。所以，要是說這種植物的下鄉是在亞洲，那麼新大陸上的民族便是從亞州遷徙過去的；否則論斷完全相反。且等着人種學家的最後判決吧！</p>
<p>最後我們知道，徐文定公初次得到番薯的秧種，看出它的利益甚溥來，乃本其濟世安民的良相的慈心，願意使「天下無饑民」；他推源番薯的栽種法，服食法，釀酒法等等，作為廿蔬疏以廣事宣傳，以為『昔人云：蔓著有六利，柿有七絕。』而番薯遠東超過它們，有「十三勝」！這種識見卓絕的提倡番薯的熱腸，同英國的Gerarde和法國的Parmentier傳播馬鈴薯的功績，可以鼎足而三先後輝映！撇開徐文定公首先介紹西洋科學到中國來的功勞不論，就憑這廣播番薯一件事說，也値得我們感恩懷德，鑄造銅像以示紀念的！然而要不是今天的舊事事提，有誰還記得他是　倡番薯的大功臣呢？徒見Gerarde和Parmentier的遺像，巍峨的矗立在海外罷了……</p>
<p>參考書古今圖書集成草木典，徐　扈農政全書，道光六年刋　白縣志，Coutiere生物世界。</p>
<p>編者按：番薯移植於北方，其中　經過　番波折，見拙者中國歷代民食政事史。嘗讀前人某筆記，者植物名稱之上冠有「西」「海」「番」等字樣者，大都為海外流人之品，余以其述焉不詳，未可盡信，然亦不能不以為無理由，姑附誌於此，惟惜書名已忘却，無從查起矣。（完）</p>

<h3>工部局　負責租船　從仰光運米來滬　每月約運到二萬噸左右　設小組會主持購運事宜</h3>
<p>據工部局公吿云、査上星期三本局董事會舉行例會時、曾議決推定董事米契爾與明思德氏兩人、與本局糧食小組委員會暨有關係方面會同硏究糧食問題、茲已提出報吿書、本局董事會爰於前（二十七）日下午、召開特別會議、愼軍討論、僉謂當前所遭遇者、厥為運輪問題、目前本埠食米存底無短絀之虞、米價之所以上漲者、蓋因一般人心對於來源發生疑慮所致、本局除非在不得已時、不欲干涉各種可靠之營業方法、不寗唯是、抑且願與提携進行、並增厚其力量、</p>
<p>疏通航運　載米來滬</p>
<p>據以上兩董事聲稱、根據搜集所得之事實、可知造成米荒之恐懼心理與夫售價之高漲情形者、其癥結所在、厥為上海與仰光間之船隻缺乏、至於由西貢運米來滬、敢信當有充分船隻、足資應用、但上海與仰光間之航運、在目前世界狀况之下、則未能通暢耳、故當務之急、應由各有關係當局盡力疏通航運、載米來滬、</p>
<p>設委員會　專責辦理</p>
<p>會議討論結果、決定小組委員會、代表本局設法租借船隻、得由仰光每月運米一萬五千噸至二萬噸到滬、至局勢好轉時為止、至於應行採辦之數量、當視本埠存底情形、隨時變更、關於租用船隻一事、深信如由該委員會出面辦理、當比一般商人出面、較為順利也、</p>
<p>限在本埠　零星發售</p>
<p>船隻一經租得、擬即付諸可靠之米糧進口商人、所征水脚、僅使其足以繳付租費與零星之意外費用在定貨之時、該委員會當囑令運貨者必須將各該船隻之空位、僅留為運載售價較廉之食米之用、而渠等與米商訂立定貨合同之時、並應載明此項米糧、僅得在本埠發售、並限售予上海米號業同業公會會員米店、以資零星售給出戶、倘有違犯上項規定者、一經察出、該委員會得以拒絕其下决定貨、一面將其姓名予以公佈、上項計劃、係經與鄰界當道會商以後決定者、希望各當道能採取同樣措施、從事於航運之疏通、</p>
<p>務求樹立　合理售價</p>
<p>本埠倘獲有正常與充分之米糧以後、則管理米價之舉、可無需要、目前仍應托付正常之業米方面、以樹立合理之售價、本局當覓取上海米號業同業公會之協助、計劃確保由於上項租借船隻運滬之米、僅限於零售、</p>
<p>仍盼米商　供給需要</p>
<p>茲有應行鄭重聲明者一點、即本局並非意在管理一切米糧之進口與分配、其所欲管理者、僅為經由租借船隻運滬之米糧耳、希望正常之業米方面、仍能繼續進行、以期應付本埠高貨之需求、並洪給外埠之需要也、</p>

<h3>煤球廠工潮　當局設法調解　被捕工人一律予以釋放</h3>
<p>本市煤球廠工人、於前日發生罷工後、全市一千數白家之柴炭號零售店、亦因工人出貨時有被罷工工友阻撓之虞、故亦停止送貨、公共租界當局、以煤係市民日用之必需品、故竭力從中謀取調解、而煤業公會、亦於昨日召集會議、商討辦法、但出席人數未足、致吿流會、至前日因脅迫未罷工之工友及阻礙煤球送貨車而被捕之五十餘工友、經租界當局審訊一過後、卽於當日（二十七日）下午五時、一律予以釋放、</p>
<p>廠方態度</p>
<p>據廠方表示、此决煤球廠工友突然發生罷工情事、匪持廠方於事前毫無所知、卽大廠中大多數工友、事前亦未能預知、僅於數日前發現有若干人至廠中微求工友加入工會情事、於罷工後復未聞有向廠方作仟何之要求、故廠方亦無從與之接洽、故現祇有請求當局從速設法解決、以免妨礙市民生活、據傳上月間、工方曾提出增加工資四成之要求、</p>
<p>工人意見</p>
<p>據工人方面稱、本市各業之中、其他各業、在茲物價高漲聲中、皆已改善待遇、獨惟柴炭煤業工人、尙沿五六年前舊例、採用最低薪給、雖其間有少數廠商、因利潤實厚、曾巳略事改善、然究屬百不得一、占數至尠、爰於上月間、幾經考慮、擬具折衷方案十項、送請業中四家同業採納辦理、函去良久、未得答復、迺再分別請本市及租界兩方當局、進行調解、該四家同業並未接納、此即工人罷工之所由也、</p>

<h3>局董名額正在折衝　競選或可避免　三總領循外交途徑談判　以維持租界均勢為原則</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局下屆董事選舉、自宣吿延期一周後、刻正由英領喬治·美領洛克赫德·及日領崛內三人、共同會商、冀循外交途徑圓滿解決、而英僑領袖凱自威（即現任總董）、與日僑居留民團主席渡邊、復進行側面折衝、預期今明兩日、將有全面決定、而於四月一日正式向工部局提出候選人名單據昨消息靈通人士稱、選舉或可免除、</p>
<p>英美不願　破壞現狀</p>
<p>査工部局現狀、為英美董七席、中日董七席、總董由英美局董擔任、總董於議案相持不決時、方有票決權、如下屆日董增加二人、而現任華董在目前環境、感遇嚴重困難、則日方不難控制租界行政、而致現狀破壞此顯非英美僑民所願、故迭决三總領之談判、勢在尋求兩全之道、一面增加日董、一方維持現狀、據熟悉內情者言、</p>
<p>增减人數　須保均衡</p>
<p>所謂南全之道、不外下列數途、（一）英華董各由五名减至四名、美日董各由二名增至三名、英美與日華各佔七席、維持均勢、但華董减少、勢將引起廣大反對、故華董仍將為五名、但其中輪流常缺一席、以為折衷、（二）英華董仍各為五名、美日董各增至五名、亦可維持現狀、（三）英華董照舊、美日董各增至三人、以保均衡、以上三項方案、以後者為最可能、如一旦商定、則選舉勢可避免、</p>

<h3>市民對於乞丐　勿佈施金錢　收容所主席建議　抉輪社並未決定</h3>
<p>本市扶輪社　前日開會時、該會乞丐收容所委員會、主席海格、曾提出一建議、主張市民勿直接以金錢給予乞丐、俾全市乞丐可以肅淸、據稱、吾人與其每日以金錢佈施乞丐、不若用以救濟貧民、此事若能實行、則不久之後、街頭乞丐即將絕跡、又稱、吾人每日以金錢佈施乞丐、無異出錢鼓勵彼等逗留街頭、故一日有人以金錢佈施乞丐、則乞丐即一日不能肅淸、海氏主張、巿民應以其每日給予乞丐者、給予能處置該問題之機關、其收效必較大於佈施、渠並要求中外人士、在二星期內、勿向乞丐佈施、惟扶輪社對此項建議、並未有所決定，</p>
<h3>竚待美國武器　決定中日戰事　美飛行堡壘運到以後　華軍即將展開總反攻</h3>
<p>大陸報社評云、紐的與華盛頓各報所載關於寇利博士向美政府提出援華建議之消息、確鑒可信、絕少置疑之理由、寇利來游自由中國、從事調査、啟程返美之前、會有言曰、「中國所需要者極微、美國所能給予者則殊夥、余確信諸君必能獲得所需之種種援助、」</p>
<p>寇利建議　必將批准</p>
<p>電傳寇利所提出之建議、略謂中國僅需飛行堡壘轟炸機二十架、最新式戰鬥機的二百架、若干航空汽油、鋼製戰具等物料、及大砲與彈藥若干而已、凡此為數可謂不多、能於羅斯福總統批准後不數日內運來中國、而羅總統將批准寇利之建議、乃必然事、蓋羅總統上决演說中、會謂、「中國巳經蔣委員長要求美國援助、而吾人巳答以中國必獲吾人之援助」也、</p>
<p>戰具獲得　即將反擊</p>
<p>中國切欲獲得美國之援助、事頗顯然、不久以前蔣委員長演說時曾稱、中國一俟接獲美國所允援助之戰具、即當展開總反攻、實施有效的反攻、自亟需大砲飛機、故料運抵中國第一批戰具中、必有大砲飛機在內、飛行堡壘轟炸機對於中國當最有用、自廿六年夏開戰起、中國因乏長距離轟炸機、不能予日本以反擊、日方則一再轟炸中國首都及其他重要城鎮、但中國獲得預期中之著名美國飛行堡壘後、不僅能飛達中國前綫之最遙遠角落、且能揚威東京及日本其他極重要城市、此等轟炸機及他種軍需之抵華、當為決定中日戰爭之轉捩點、</p>

<h3>辣斐德路上的文化</h3>
<p>— 蔚</p>
<p>辣斐德路是相當長和寬敞的馬路，東首直通老西門，現有鐵門封鎖着；西迄霞飛路為止，而與白賽仲路啣接。近兩年來交通也顯得方便了。有由打浦橋到愛多亞路外灘的廿一路公共汽車，也有由勞勃生路通老西門的廿四路無軌電車在經過，使辣斐德路東半段的氣象，逐漸繁盛起來。從呂班路以西的一帶兩旁有明靜寬闊的行人道，在高大的梧桐樹下散步，一面還可欣賞法國公園和住宅花園裏的花木，聽小鳥在樹枝歌唱，為散步的人們奏樂。那是挺有意思的。但是我更愛這條路的東首的短短的一程，從薩坡賽路到貝勒路近乎二百碼的距離，這裏充滿着活躍的氣象，新生的朝氣，雖然兩旁攤販塞途，市聲喧囂，但這並不足使這段馬路為之减色。</p>
<p>除了律師公會房子裏的大同大學和中學外，在附近一帶的小學校，大的有七八所。此外還有一所敎堂。每天早中晚二個時期，有數千百個男女小舉生上學或由校中放學回家，經過着。這羣學齡的孩子穿着各色不同的衣服，手提書包，載奔載跳地上學或回家。有俏麗的，有醜惡的有整潔的，也有襤褸的；但都充滿着天眞的稚氣，和純潔的美麗。我最喜歡當這些孩子們經校裏放學出來的時候，在這段馬路上踱着，雜在道羣大眞的孩子羣中，來回地踱步，聽她們一路談笑，或學唱着剛由先生敎她們的一首新歌，她們的愉快，好像使我回到她們的學齡時代感受着同樣的愉快。我有時候正當學校放飯的時候，去守候在校鬥口迎接着我的孩子們經校裏出來，當她們驀地裏發現她們的爸爸在校門口迎接她們的時候，她們是多麽歡欣呀！正如爸爸媽媽經外面回家忽然帶給她們許多精美的點心糖菓或玩具，孩子們同樣地感覺着出乎意外的快樂一樣·因之，我的孩子們常要我在吃飯的時候在校門前迎接她們，可是我總對她們說以後不再來了。我却又常常在下午放學的時候，徘徊在她們校裏的敎堂前面，那裏也種着一些平凡的草花和常靑樹之類。孩于們是常喜歡爸媽給予她們意外的恩惠的。</p>

<h3>血的力量</h3>
<p>— 嚴正</p>
<p>血沒有白流的，也不會白流的。</p>
<p>七十二位烈士的血，終於激起了革命的浪濤的澎湃，終於冲毀了專制的寳座。</p>
<p>北伐，…都一樣。一句話：流血！</p>
<p>吝嗇血是不對的。應該儘需要的流，流。</p>
<p>血的債需要血來淸償。害怕滴一滴血，結果只使血流得更多，流得枉然。</p>
<p>紀念先烈，不應該在口頭上，紙上。應該懂得血的價値，爭取血的代價！</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>我的顴骨</h3>
<p>— 秋聲</p>
<p>我不敢自稱為一個被解放了的新式女子，不過在敎育上，我享受了「男女平等」的權利。—和一般的男子，同樣的，由小學，中學，而大學。這也可說，在「解放婦女」聲中，少數女子的絕無僅有的收獲吧！</p>
<p>我不知這對於寳貴的收獲，應當慶賀抑是哀悼；因為我因此而認識了更多的女子不應有的苦痛。</p>
<p>女子的面貌比學問更重要，如果不信，請看結婚的禮堂裏，批着「郞才女貌」「才子佳人」等富麗堂皇的金字喜幛；他們為什應以「容貌」贊揚女人，以「才學」稱頌男子呢？我以為這至少對於女子有些侮辱，可是，過去是這樣，現在還是這樣。</p>
<p>如果我是男子，也許被人稱為英俊幹練的美少年，可是我不幸為女人。請別以為我是粗眉大眼的醜丫頭，我並沒有絲毫的自誇：我有白晳的皮膚，端正的耳·目·口·鼻，壞就是壞在顴骨略高些。男子的顴骨略高，不是更可增加其英俊幹練的外表嗎？可是我不是男子呀！</p>
<p>「女子顴骨高，殺夫不用刀」。我在女子中學讀書時，就有好多女同學，背地裏這樣地批評我。我被她們的評語嚇了一跳，我偷偷地常對着鏡子撫摸着我聳起的一雙顴骨。我很可憐她，何不幸生在女子的臉上！我又想：女子的顴骨，對於丈夫，有什麽關係呢？我笑了，笑那些批評我的同學，無科學頭腦。女學生這樣，無怪鄕下無知的老嫗要迷信了！</p>
<p>可是鐵一般的事實，是最有力的雄辯，我還有什麽話可說呢？</p>
<p>遠在十年前，那時我在大學二年級讀書，我愛上了一個工科二年級的同學，他也很愛我。不到一年，我們的情感，超過了友誼，主尖第二年的一個春天，我們徵得雙方家長的同意，就在上海訂婚了。我們都覺得：我們的婚姻，進行得很順利，而又很滿意；是的，同學們也都很羨慕我們。我們計劃：在畢業後的第一個冬天，舉行婚禮；可能的話，我們還想在冬天後過的春天裏，舉行我們的蜜月旅行：我和一般少女一樣地憧憬着未來的美麗生活。唉！誰知道，這是幻想，是永遠不能兌現的幻想呢！</p>
<p>眞所謂「有獨無偶」，不幸的事偏輪在我有高顴骨的女子身上。</p>
<p>在我們訂婚後的一個暑假裏，我的未婚夫染着了時疫而與世長逝了，這不幸消息的傳來，眞似睛天起了一個霹靂，我因此哭了幾夜。</p>
<p>但是，社會是冷酷的，它不但不肯為受了重創者略表同情，反而使傷心的人兒更悲傷。</p>
<p>未婚夫死了，於是「女子顴骨高，殺夫不用刀」，被證實而傳遍了全校；從此同學們和我疏遠了，好似我的顴骨，不但能殺丈夫，而且還能有傷和我過往較密的朋友；於是我開始感到了孤寂；同時我對我那雙略高的顴骨格外憐惜。</p>
<p>昨天天氣很好，我在太陽光下整理我的衣裳，無意中發現了被壓在箱底下已足有十多年的我未婚夫的遺像；十多年前，好似昨天，影中人依然向我微笑，可是我已不是十多年前的我了！我現在的心，正如枯井，再也不興波浪了！我已被四遭的人們，用「尅丈夫」，「望門寡婦」等名詞屏窠了！我已被籠罩在惡魔的巨掌之下，巨掌要把我推到黑暗的深谷中去。我排除不了舊社會遺留下的桎梏，我雖有新思想，然而到何處去奔放呢？</p>
<p>我已年老了，春天已屬於年靑人，可是年靑人的少女中，誰難保證不生生理上所構成的高顴骨呢？我捧着我微笑的影中人痛哭了。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（五）愛與慾的分野</p>
<p>湘綺一直就站在他的背後，很敏捷地答復他所發的問句，但這時却故意不就回答。</p>
<p>「是你的表兄弟嗎？」秋海棠突然回過頭去，很莽撞地問。</p>
<p>湘綺忍不住哧噗一笑。</p>
<p>「表兄弟？他自己吿訴你的嗎？怎麽這個人也猜不到！他就是我的親哥哥，至今還在南方養病。我們在小時候倒的最親熱的！」</p>
<p>「我怎麽偏不能生在她家呢？」又是一椿憾事，秋海棠想。</p>
<p>可是越往後翻，他的憾事却越來越多，因為有不少照相，都不是湘綺一個人照的；跟她同照的人有些是親戚，有些是同學，在秋海棠的眼睛裏看來，這些人的運氣都是非常的好，是以使他相形見絀。</p>
<p>直到那個啞丫頭把一籠現蒸的肉包子端出來，他還沒有看到最後一頁。</p>
<p>「你打算幾進回北京去？」湘綺伴着她的特客吃了幾個包子以後，便放下了筷子這樣問。</p>
<p>「我暫時不想出台，就是在這裏多躭擱幾時也不妨。」秋海棠幾乎就想說：「我希望能够和你時常談，只要袁鎭守使不來，我就不走。」</p>
<p>他的話雖然沒有說出來，但湘綺心裏已早就明白了。</p>
<p>「明天你可以到這裏來吃午飯；祇要我們行動謹愼一些，這裏你是可以常來的。」</p>
<p>從此，秋海棠果然就接連着到羅家來了三次，無論在形跡上和精神上，彼此都禁不住有一種熱情流露了出來，只是雙方都很知道自制，即使在最興奮的時節，也不過相對一笑而已。</p>
<p>後來班裏所有的角兒和他手下的人差不多回去了，趙四也一再的跟他說，如果沒有什麽要事，還是早些回北京去的好；同進袁紹文也有快信給他，吿訴他自己從承德回京，看到了他幾天前所打去的電報，不知道天津的事情講好沒有，希望他早些去信答復，或是爽快回京面談，這樣才使秋海棠決定準第二天動身。（六七）</p>

<h3>「紅髮女人」</h3>
<p>— 黃新德</p>
<p>「紅髮女人」寫的是女伶李絲蓮卡德夫人的生活史，好萊塢作品，過去以女伶身世為題材的，已數見不鮮，所以「紅髮女人」的題材，就不見得新鮮，不過故事的本身，有不少悲歡離合，故演出方面，還相當動人。</p>
<p>故事開塲，就寫李絲蓮因離婚而喪失她的愛子，接着就寫她遭受社會上的物議，乃憤而去演劇，希望在她成名之後，可以重獲她的愛子與社會的溫情，可是她在藝術上雖然成功，而十九世紀的美國社會，仍然鄙視着李絲蓮的為人，她的愛子和她隔離日久，也不願意跟她多親熱一下，於是李絲蓮只得抱着一顆創痕的心去為藝術而努力。</p>
<p>全片故事，當然不會這麽簡單，當然還得加上她的浪漫絲，驟看之下，仿佛劇作者在極力抨擊當時的封建勢力，但導演者把這一點輕描淡寫地帶了過去，而盡力渲染她怎樣艱苦地踏上成功之路，譬如她初次持了介紹信去見著名劇作家克勞特倫斯的受冷淡，以及再度走訪時從黃昏等到深夜，終於使這位劇作家情不可却，而替她寫了一個劇本，她便從此一登龍門，身家十位起來。這些塲面，都是導演者用了全副的精力，去描寫李絲蓮的成功，並不是偶然的。</p>
<p>曼琳霍金絲雖則年萎老去，但飾這樣中年婦人，還覺得恰合身份，尤其是李絲蓮卡德這樣的女人，特別適合她的個性，所以演來倍覺動人。配角中以克勞特倫斯的劇作家演得最好，此公是個多方面的演員，她能夠飾演任何角色，在這部片裏，他不過演得更出色吧了。倘導演者把全劇的最高潮，能夠處理得更為有力一些，那末，這部戲在演出方面，還會比現在更出色的。</p>
<h3>劇藝新聞</h3>

<p>周信芳自從去年生了一塲脫力傷寒以後，他因為急於要登台，沒有好好的調攝，所以未曾完全恢復健康，在一個月前就舊病復發了一次，好得病態並不嚴重，祇經極短時期的休養，就又和觀察見面，不料前天他又病倒，使愛護他的朋友，都非常開心。</p>
<p>昨天，記者和周夫人通了一次電話，欣　麒老牌已佔勿藥，並定今晚銷假登台，這個消息是値得向麒迷同志們吿慰的。至於麒老牌去夏的一塲脫力傷寒病，完全為了上海伶界聯合會保產委員會演唱義務戲太賣力，太辛苦所釀成的。當初，伶聯會有出賣梨園坊的事件，經周信芳竭力反對，在報間發表一篇文字，向全體伶界呼顯保留祖產，於是得到一般靑年伶人　高百歲，張翼鵬，李瑞來，李順來等的同情，紛紛起而響應，纔使伶聯會打銷出賣的意思，組織保產委員會，演劇募款還債。信芳對於這件事當然特別起勁，但究竟是快到五十歲的人，體力不支，就累出一塲大病來，現在梨園坊已經全部贖回，這個功勞，自非信芳莫屬了。</p>

<h3>「囝囡劇社」訪問</h3>
<p>— 慕爾</p>
<p>上海自從「孩子劇團」走後，兒童演戲的劇團，到現在，比較有地些成績的，似乎只誕生了一個「囝囡劇社」。</p>
<p>最近知道「囝囡劇社」為了慶祝兒童節，又將在寗波同鄕會舉行第四次公演，我就去作了一個短短的訪問。</p>
<p>走進劇社的門，正在排「兒童節」和「猩猩王」。我為了不便絞斷他們的工作，就在旁邊靜聽着。原來「兒童節」是暴露學生們和苦孩子，在兒童節那天過的不同的生活。「猩猩王」是童話劇，表現着幾千年前，「快樂村」上的居民，怎樣擊退猩猩王的故事。</p>
<p>後來，向劇社裏的某君，問起他們過去的情形和未來的動向。據他說這劇社的目的，是要提倡兒童的正常娛樂，發揮兒童的剩餘精力，由兒童們做戲給兒童們看，希望以兒童劇來代替早塲電影。過去除開在大劇塲公演外，也曾到過孤兒院等地方去輪迴演戲。這次的「兒童節」，就是和某孤兒院合作演出的。</p>
<p>我聽了這樣的叙述，覺得「囝囡劇社」的工作，很有意義。假使不斷的努力下去，前途未可限量。</p>

<h3>Major Victory for British Forces in East Africa: Keren and Harar Fall Yesterday, Three-Quarters of African Colonies Now Taken, Looming Signs of the Total Collapse of the Italian Empire</h3>
<p>London, official circles announced late yesterday that the British Empire forces had achieved two major victories in Africa: the first was the capture of Keren, a mountain fortress on the Agordat-Massawa line, which had been besieged for seven weeks. Its fall undoubtedly seals the fate of Italian Eritrea. The second victory was the capture of Harar, the second largest city in Abyssinia, the eastern gateway to the capital. British forces advanced swiftly on two fronts, one attacking Italian bases in Eritrea, the other advancing into the heart of Abyssinia at lightning speed. Fierce fighting had taken place at the Marda Pass guarding Harar just days ago, but now Harar is in British hands, and British forces are advancing on the capital from all directions. Once the capital falls, Italian power in East Africa will be wiped out. Keren is about 75 miles west of Asmara (the Eritrean capital), with a railway connecting to the Red Sea port of Massawa. Harar is about 280 miles east of the capital, with a population of 25,000. With the fall of Keren, three-quarters of Mussolini's oldest colonies are now in British hands. In the entire campaign to capture Italian East Africa, the strongest obstacle the British encountered was the fortress of Keren, the main shield for the important town of Asmara. The Italians wanted to resist the fierce British attacks in Africa for as long as possible, so they had to defend this important position to the death. Keren is situated on a mountain ridge thousands of feet high, with steep cliffs, a dangerous terrain, and natural defenses. Military experts acknowledge it as the most solid natural fortress, with heavy weapons protecting each peak and a dense network of machine-gun nests making it extremely strong. However, after weeks of preparation, the British forces finally conquered this formidable obstacle in one fell swoop. (Reuter, 28th) (Detailed map on page 6 of this newspaper, 28th)</p>
<p>London, Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that the fall of Keren effectively marks the end of the fighting in Italian Eritrea. The Italian army may not put up strong resistance in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, and Massawa, the key port, because the Italian Governor Aosta concentrated all his forces to defend the capital and Keren. Therefore, Asmara and Massawa may fall within days after being attacked by British forces. The Italian army fought hard at Keren, suffering heavy casualties, but ultimately could not withstand the fierce British attacks. The British capture of Harar is also important, as it threatens the main line of communication between the capital and coastal Djibouti. However, the British army does not need to rush to occupy the entire territory of Abyssinia, as most of this task can be entrusted to the patriotic Abyssinian army, it is said. An official communiqué stated that British Indian troops, with the assistance of the British Air Force, defeated the numerically superior enemy and occupied Keren after two weeks of fierce fighting under difficult conditions. A communiqué from the British Air Force stated that in the past twelve days, the British and South African Air Forces dropped 120 tons of bombs on Keren. The British aircraft provided great assistance to the British army besieging Keren by continuously circling over Italian positions from morning to night and fiercely bombing the area with 40 tons of bombs in the previous four days. South African fighters were also active in the area. A few hours before the fall of Keren on Wednesday, two South African planes shot down two Italian fighters. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>British Commander's Divine Military Strategy</p>
<p>London, Reuters military correspondent reports that Italian East Africa is now under the control of General Wavell (Commander-in-Chief of British Forces in the Middle East). With the fall of Keren, Wavell can now move his troops to fight another enemy. The ferocity of the Italian fighting at Keren was unprecedented in Italian history, but they were defeated due to General Wavell's divine military strategy. Currently, the British army occupies Sidi Barrani on the Egyptian-Libyan border. General Wavell transferred two detachments of troops from the British army that captured that area, one entirely of Indian troops, to south of Sudan, with the mission of attacking Keren from Kassala on the Eritrean border. The two places are more than a thousand miles apart, across a desert. Few commanders dared to lead troops to attack from that direction, but General Wavell's strategy has now succeeded. If necessary, he can transfer most of his troops to fight elsewhere. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>Blackshirt Warriors' Reputation Swept Away</p>
<p>Cairo, British military officials here claimed last night that an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 Italian troops defended Keren and Harar, accounting for one-third of the Italian army in Italian East Africa. Now that they have been defeated, it may lead to the total collapse of the remaining Italian forces in East Africa under Abyssinian Governor Aosta. The fall of Keren is a major blow to the morale and prestige of the Italian army. Now that Abyssinia is also under new threat from the Sudan, Aosta will find it even more difficult to cope. The Belgian army and the Sudanese border guards from the Sudanese side have occupied Gambella, an important trading post near the border. If the Italian army reinforces that area, its 150-mile-long line of communication with the capital will be in danger. Furthermore, the Italian troops in other threatened areas are already fighting defensively, trying to hold on to their positions. It is doubtful whether they can spare troops to reinforce. At the beginning of the war, it was estimated that Aosta led a total of 220,000 Italian troops, 10,000 of whom were wiped out in the Somaliland campaign. Although there are important mountain peaks between Keren and the capital that can be used for defense, the Italian army may not stubbornly resist. Cairo currently expects the Italian army to suffer repeated defeats and will not be able to hold out until the rainy season. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>British and Indian Allied Forces Are Invincible</p>
<p>London, dispatch from Reuters special correspondent at the Keren front: After careful preparation, the British Highland Army and the Indian Army launched a fierce attack on Keren and finally captured it. The British forces began advancing along the roads on both sides of the Keren Valley at 4:30 pm on Tuesday, one advancing along the railway line and the other advancing along the opposite hillside, both exceeding the original plan and progressing very quickly. The British forces on the right quickly crossed the Keren Avenue and attacked a certain place. When the army stipulated the time of the attack, the Italian army began to counterattack the Dologorodoc fort. A team of Indian troops quickly advanced to a new position and, after fierce fighting, annihilated the counterattacking Italian army. One of our colonels was killed in action, and one major was captured. The Indian team then defeated a large Italian force, capturing many enemies. At the same time, the British forces advancing along the railway line suddenly attacked the headquarters of an Italian colonel. The colonel and two other officers were captured. The link between the Italian troops at the Sanchil peaks controlling the highway and the railway was also cut off by the British forces. The Italian army launched four counterattacks against the new positions occupied by the British army, but they were all repulsed and suffered heavy losses. On Thursday morning, the British artillery shelled fiercely for an hour. At 7 am, the British armored units rushed into Keren. The Italian army began to retreat after its resistance completely collapsed. The British army immediately sent two teams into the city, one advancing rapidly along the highway to Asmara, until it was temporarily stopped by Italian tanks and vehicles abandoned on the road. The other team of British troops advanced rapidly along the Magalei Valley in the northwest, surrounding the Italian troops resisting on the left side of the British army. It is estimated that at least 1,500 enemies were captured. The remnants of the Italian army retreating towards Asmara were repeatedly attacked by British artillery and aircraft, and the British infantry occupying the surrounding heights also strafed them fiercely. In the two days and nights before the fall of Keren, the Italian army launched twelve counterattacks, all of which failed. The number of casualties could not be estimated, but it is known that the Italian army has suffered thousands of casualties. The enemy army is in chaos and is unlikely to hold Asmara. A large number of Italian families are retreating to Asmara, so the Italian side may declare the area a non-defended city. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>Italian Army's Escape Route to the Sea Cut Off</p>
<p>London, the British army has captured Keren, which means that the entire Italian Eritrea has no defenses. The two routes of the British army, advancing from the west and from the northern coastal plain, to capture Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, have been opened up. At present, the Italian army's route from Abyssinia to the sea has been cut off, with only the railway through French Djibouti remaining. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Pope Appeals for Peace</h3>
<p>Vatican City, Pope Pius XII delivered a speech this morning, reiterating his appeal for peace. Well-informed sources believe that the Holy See will ask the world to end the bloody tragedy. The Pope asked, "Why must the restoration of peace still be achieved through bloodshed, when those of intellect and goodwill can restrain their emotions and treat others with forgiveness? Justice and equality alone are sufficient to rebuild peace and tranquility, allowing all nations to coexist on this earth. The Pope will always persevere, pray diligently, and do everything possible to promote the early realization of peace." (International, 28th)</p>
<h3>Lease of Atlantic Bases Signed by Britain and the United States, Limited to Ninety-Nine Years, New Stage of Cooperation Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>London, American Ambassador to Britain Winant and British Prime Minister Churchill signed an agreement yesterday on naval bases, stipulating that the United States has the right to lease naval and air bases in the West Indies and Newfoundland for ninety-nine years. Those who participated in the signing also included Maroni, Fashi, and Desmond, members of President Roosevelt's special committee on leased bases. The agreement allows the United States to enjoy extensive rights at the bases, including transforming naval port facilities, controlling ships and aircraft, and deploying underwater defenses. The agreement also stipulates that no tariffs may be levied on various raw materials or US supplies shipped from British colonies to the various bases. The United States can also try American, British, and other nationals suspected of espionage in the area. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington, President Roosevelt yesterday sent the agreement signed in London on leasing naval and air force bases to Congress. The agreement includes eight locations: Newfoundland, Bermuda, Bahamas, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Trinidad, Antigua, and British Guiana. An attached document to this agreement states, "These bases are for resisting aggression against the United States' national defense and building such defensive works." President Roosevelt said that since the evolution of the international situation last autumn, this kind of outpost defense for the Western Hemisphere has become even more important. (United Press International, 28th)</p>
<p>Signing Ceremony</p>
<p>London, the US-British agreement to lease Atlantic bases to the United States was signed yesterday afternoon in an atmosphere of happiness in the Cabinet Room at 10 Downing Street. After British Prime Minister Churchill signed the agreement with four fountain pens, he gave the four pens to the four American signatories, including US Ambassador Winant, as souvenirs. The names of the recipients were engraved on the pens. The full text of the agreement was released yesterday. An official statement also stated that the quick signing of this agreement after the passage of the lease act demonstrates the development of the good neighborly and cooperative policies adopted by the two democratic countries, Britain and the United States, for their common interests, and has now entered a new stage. The interests of Britain are no less than those of the United States, and the interests of the colonies where the bases are located, as well as Canada and Newfoundland, will be explained by this agreement. According to this agreement, Britain should give the United States the fullest possible convenience in the face of potential danger, so as to protect its security and prevent unlimited dangers in the future. The leasing of these bases is a very real contribution by the territories concerned to the Allied cause of resisting tyranny and foreign lifestyles. (Reuter, 28th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Warning to Speculators</h3>
<p>Since rice and grain have been controlled by speculators, black market prices have surged, rising repeatedly without end, and coal briquettes have followed suit. Currently, the price of imported rice has reached over 110 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), and coal briquettes have reached 12 yuan per dan (unit of weight). Other items, such as boiled water, have increased from one fen (currency unit) to two fen per ladle, and cut noodles have gradually risen from just over 3 jiao (currency unit) to 6 jiao per jin (unit of weight). For these items, there are still so-called "fair-price coal" and "cheap flour" available for supply to regulate the market, but how much can be provided cheaply, and are they available to the general public? In addition, other goods have risen in response to the trend, increasing by 20-30% or more. Looking back to the spring of last year, prices also soared, led by the price of rice, followed by price increases of all other goods. This year, it is happening again. And those in the trade often blame it on speculators, saying it is the work of hoarders. This statement is not false, but those who trade with speculators and those who help speculators sell their goods are all intermediaries in the trade. Speculators are undoubtedly guilty, but can those in the trade be excused? They mutually benefit from each other, repeatedly exploiting the situation, and increasing profits, whereas before they would make a 10% profit, now they won't sell without a 40-50% profit, and thus a great profit is in hand.</p>
<p>Seeking profit is the desire of most people, and we don't need to criticize it deeply. What we pray for is: first, that most people can each obtain their due profit; second, that those who profit do so without harming others and can enjoy their profits. But this is not the case now. Not only are the beneficiaries only a very small number of people in society, not only does this small number of people harm the majority, but even this small number of people who profit may not be able to enjoy their profits in the end. According to the truest principle, profit and harm are like shadows, and there is no such thing as all profit without any harm. In the Jin Dynasty, there was a man named Shi Chong who was arrested and taken to the East Market. He lamented, "These slaves covet my family's wealth." The arresting officer replied, "Knowing that wealth leads to harm, why didn't you distribute it earlier?" Chong could not answer. However, during his lifetime, Chong only knew to accumulate wealth and build magnificent houses. His music and instruments were the best of the time, and his cuisine was the most exquisite of land and sea. How could he have known that there would be a day when he would die, his family would be destroyed, and his wealth would be lost? This is because too much wealth is most likely to invite disaster, especially in chaotic times. Although this saying seems trite, it remains unchanged throughout history. Even in today's economic theory, the so-called profit must return both principal and interest to be a real benefit. If you have goods in hand and the price soars, it is still like a flower in a mirror or the moon in the water. Even if it is as all speculators hope, in the near future, prices will only rise and not fall, so there is little need to worry about losses; but they do not consider that consumers' consumption, whether it is rice, cloth, oil, salt, or vegetables, although it is said that they cannot be lacking for a day, due to high prices and low purchasing power, people sigh in despair and stop buying. If so, then where is the profit for speculators? This is one reason. The public's livelihood is unsustainable, and starving people will rise up to cause trouble, and public order is in danger. Then there is no choice but to take emergency measures, requisitioning daily necessities for public use, selling them at fair prices, and stabilizing people's livelihood. Although this has not been implemented today, if speculators continue to do evil, prices continue to rise, and the situation continues to be chaotic, then who knows if there will be such a day? This is the second reason. The reason why there is so much hoarding now is because, first, there is no end to the price increases; second, all goods are rising, but the interest on bank deposits is decreasing. Therefore, those with more financial capacity would rather pool their resources. Those with little wealth hoard a little, and those with great financial capacity hoard a lot, so there is hoarding of everything, and there is an increase in prices for everything. There are even those who use low-interest deposits to make huge stockpiles, that is, using the public's resources to harm the public. Such a method can only be done once, and it cannot last long. As time goes on, it will inevitably be rejected by reason, and then people will urgently seek to sell off their goods, and prices will plummet. Where is the benefit for the general speculators? This is the third reason. Speculators mostly use the resources of the financial industry and warehouses. Once the financial industry discriminates against loans for hoarding and reduces them, and stays outside the scope of speculation itself, it can be predicted that although prices may not return to their old levels for various reasons, it will be difficult to maintain today's high prices. This is the fourth reason. The greedy ignore the so-called legal sanctions, truly because the law is sometimes powerless; they ignore the so-called social sanctions, truly because society is like loose sand and seems to have no power; but social sanctions are slow in coming, and when they are launched one day, they will have an irresistible and tremendous power. It is expected that in the future, there will be more and more people who make ill-gotten gains from hoarding, leading to them being unable to stand in Shanghai. This is also the so-called social sanction; they will leave in tears, so what is the benefit of wealth? This is the fifth reason. Or, without hoarding, the stockpiles of all supplies in Shanghai would not be so abundant. How can you know that the panic wouldn't be even worse than today? The meaning of this is that they rely on this hoarding. The so-called abundance does not refer to the abundance of goods stored in warehouses. Goods stored in warehouses are indeed valuable, but there is still a shortage of circulation in the market, and market prices are still soaring. From the consumer's point of view, abundance and non-abundance are the same. Trading to seek legitimate profits is the business of merchants; hoarding to enrich oneself at the expense of society is the crime of unscrupulous merchants. The two are very different and cannot be combined into one to excuse unscrupulous merchants. Now, the sources of various goods have not been cut off, but speculators, with their strong financial resources, not only hold on to what they have accumulated and refuse to sell it, but also sweep up what is newly arrived and store it in warehouses, not to be sold on the market; if it is said that they will ultimately not be subject to sanctions, those who understand reason will not believe it. The greedy take advantage of the dark days, but they should know that the days of darkness will soon see the light of day. Even in the darkness, is the protection of wealth guaranteed? Thinking of this, shouldn't they realize the truth?</p>

The purpose of Matsuoka's visit to Germany is to obtain greater benefits from the Tripartite Pact. There is no doubt that Germany will make any guarantees for what Japan may need, but there is reason to believe that they may not be of greater value than those given to other politicians who have come to Berlin. According to the German official news agency, Matsuoka met with Funk, president of the German Reichsbank, today to discuss strengthening German-Japanese economic relations and the principles of organizing financial and commercial transactions between Europe and East Asia after the end of the war.

<h3>Japanese Troops Retreat in Two Directions in Northern Jiangxi; Chinese Army Fiercely Attacks Main Japanese Force; Remnants near Gao'an Cleared Out; Japanese Encircled North of Jin River</h3>
<p>Chongqing Yesterday afternoon, a military spokesperson told reporters that in the Jiangxi province battles, the Japanese suffered 20,000 casualties. After the Chinese army repelled Japanese troops in the north and south, it fiercely attacked the main Japanese force near Gao'an. As a result, the Japanese backbone, composed of a division, retreated in defeat in two groups, one by boat and one by land, in disarray. The Chinese army sank over fifty ships full of Japanese soldiers. Gao'an was recaptured two days ago, and all remaining Japanese were cleared out by the Chinese army. Japanese troops retreating by land along the north bank of the Jin River have been encircled near Nancha. The Japanese are running out of food, which is currently being supplied by Japanese aircraft. Two days ago, the Chinese shot down a Japanese plane. It is expected that all Japanese troops here will be completely eliminated within one or two days. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing During a weekly briefing for foreign reporters, a Chinese military spokesperson confirmed that the Chinese army had occupied Gao'an and that the Japanese suffered losses nearly as severe as in the previous Battle of Taierzhuang. Since the flanks of the Japanese troops in Gao'an had been routed by the Chinese army, the division-sized central force was caught in a salient and attacked from both sides. In total, the Japanese used three divisions in this battle. The Japanese troops in the Nancha area are still resisting stubbornly but are surrounded, relying solely on Japanese aircraft to supply food and provisions. Yesterday, the Chinese army shot down a Japanese plane full of supplies. The Chinese spokesperson denied Japanese claims of occupying Shanggao, stating that there was no change on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang front, where the Japanese advances failed, resulting in three to four thousand casualties and showing signs of collapse. The Chinese army in Guangdong has captured Pingshanwei. There have been no significant developments in North China. It has been observed that the Japanese have intensified their blockade along the coast for the past month, apparently attempting to cut off Chinese overseas supplies and defeat the main Chinese force to eliminate worries for their southward advance. In reality, even if the Japanese gain some small victories along the coast, the defeats in northern Jiangxi, southern Shanxi, western Anhui, and west of Yichang have come at a significant cost.

<h3>Regarding the Chinese Communist Question: George Bernard Shaw Issues Statement; China Should Consolidate Unity; Any Division is a Mistake</h3>
<p>London The famous literary figure George Bernard Shaw recently made a statement to the Central News Agency regarding the Chinese Communist question, stating that although his own position is biased towards the Communist Party, he absolutely agrees with Generalissimo Chiang's advice to the CCP. The central government may be misled by the precedent of Brest-Litovsk (referring to the place where the Soviet Bolshevik government and Germany made a separate peace in the First World War). However, they must recognize that the current situation is significantly different from that at the time. President Roosevelt recently supported Chiang Kai-shek's need for assistance. We must ensure that he achieves his goal. In fact, the United States is fighting Japan side-by-side with China. Under these circumstances, for China to consolidate its unity, it will definitely achieve victory. Therefore, any military division made by any party before this goal is achieved is a mistake and will be cursed by future generations. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Refugees Gather; Public Health a Concern; Fears of Epidemics This Summer; Authorities Greatly Concerned</h3>
<p>Hong Kong In Hong Kong's residential areas, there are few houses and many people. It is common for five people to sleep in one bed, but they do not complain and even welcome the arrival of the hot summer, which is because of the ongoing war in China. However, health authorities are quite worried about this situation because of the high mortality rate from lung disease and the spreading trend of the tiger epidemic. The situation will be even more dangerous with the arrival of the rainy season. The reason why Hong Kong is overcrowded is that refugees from all parts of China have gathered here, especially from Guangdong. Refugees from Shanghai are mostly wealthy, and they do not want to return to Shanghai for political reasons. Hong Kong currently has a population of 1.6 million, twice as many as usual. It is generally believed that this number is too large, and if anything unexpected happens, it will make it difficult for the defense authorities to defend. European and American women and children, and some wealthy Chinese, have previously gone to Manila or Honolulu, while the rest remain here to overcome all difficulties. When asked why they don't leave, the general Chinese response is "There is nowhere to go." The Chinese in Hong Kong do not all believe that they are in a safe area. Those who are well-off, whether they were born locally or came from the mainland, often ask foreign news agencies if Hong Kong is in danger. The current situation in the European war is not as reported in the newspapers, which is why they are fearful. The reason for their fear is that they only receive one-sided news here, and the local newspapers are sometimes subject to news censorship, often leaving blank spaces. In fact, the news from all international news agencies, including the International News Service, is not censored upon arrival, and British newspapers are free to publish all the news from Britain and the United States. Even the news from Japanese news agencies is not prohibited. (28th International Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Analyzes the Far East Situation; Japan's Adventurous Southern Advance Inevitably Leads to Unfortunate Consequences</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Hong Kong published an article by the famous London reporter Garvin analyzing the situation in the Far East. Garvin believes that the U.S.'s determination to resist aggression remains unchanged, and Japan's southern advance may therefore be halted. Garvin stated that Singapore has become an impregnable fortress, and Hong Kong is also determined to defend the area at all costs. From now on, we will not easily give up an inch of land due to Japanese pressure. Japan's ambitions are endless, and Japan's warmongers are now imitating Nazi tactics. Their adventure in China, now in its fourth year, has been unable to extricate itself and has achieved nothing. They still dream of conquering 400 million people, and it may never be possible to realize this dream in the long run. The United States has the determination to deal with all eventualities. If Japan rashly thinks of advancing south, it would be tantamount to suicide. (27th Dispatch)</p>

Newspapers published special editions with large characters proclaiming the South Korean king's declaration. The public spontaneously marched, holding photographs of King Peter of South Korea. Everywhere, order was maintained. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>London, Reuters military commentator stated that the South Korean military and civilians' support for the young king, opposition to Nazi rule, and cleansing of South Korean traitors will have a significant impact on the military situation. The Nazi army can no longer use South Korea as a base to attack Greece southward along the Vardar River valley. If the German army prepares to seize the route south by force, it will encounter South Korean resistance and war will break out, and the fighting will be fierce, and the German army will suffer significant losses. The people of South Korea are known for their bravery, and the terrain of South Korea is extremely difficult to advance on, but very suitable for defensive warfare. Now the Nazi general staff must deal with the situation of attacking Greece along the Struma River valley and the Mesta River valley, on a limited length of the front line, or deploying more troops to attack South Korea simultaneously. If so, the German forces will feel even more strained and may not succeed. Therefore, the earliest result of the new situation in South Korea may be that the German side will be delayed for at least several weeks before engaging in any activities in the Balkan Peninsula.

<h3>South Korea's New Prime Minister Issues Declaration, Calls on Nation to Support Government</h3>
<p>Nanking Capital, The new Prime Minister of South Korea, Simović, issued a declaration at yesterday's cabinet meeting, stating that the people of South Korea are deeply concerned about national affairs in these difficult times. The state of public anxiety over the past few days has been extremely evident, and the country's laws and order have been threatened. Therefore, there has been this cabinet reshuffle. King Peter II has now ascended the throne and a national unity cabinet has been formed, so the people need no longer be anxious. Now, as the leader of the government, I call on all the people of the country to support the government and work together to maintain the country's laws and order and maintain peace. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin, According to information from here yesterday, a "pressing demand" clarifying South Korea's attitude towards the Axis powers has been handed over to South Korea by the German government. The new South Korean cabinet held a meeting at 10:30 PM last night and decided to issue a formal statement today. Here, the United States' aid to South Korea is dismissed as premature. The Nazi side said, "South Korea will issue a clear statement before the weekend. It is not known whether we will be rejected in this statement." However, Germany firmly believes that South Korea will respect its obligations to the Axis powers, so it is waiting quietly for the development of the situation. The German side acknowledges that the situation is already very complex and cannot be judged hastily at this time. However, the Germans are prepared to protect their interests. The German side also said that they firmly believe that South Korea will not risk "serious consequences" by abandoning the Axis pact. (International News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Young King Breaks Free from Pro-German Pact, Issues Edict to Accelerate Troop Mobilization</h3>
<p>Nanking Capital, The South Korean government seized power at 2:00 AM yesterday morning (Shanghai time Thursday morning 8:00 AM). The seventeen-year-old Crown Prince Peter broke free from the restraints of his regency and declared himself king at 3:00 AM, taking the title Peter II. This coup d'état overthrew the government that signed the pro-German pact without bloodshed. The new King Peter immediately issued an edict stating that the mobilization of the South Korean army is being accelerated and will be completed soon. At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Peter rode through the city, and the public cheered along the way. Most people said that the establishment of the new government was a manifestation of the public's dissatisfaction with being attached to the Axis powers. British and American flags were flying from many buildings in the streets. A beautiful woman was carried through the city on the shoulders of the crowd, covered with flowers. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Nanking Capital, The new South Korean government launched a major coup yesterday without bloodshed. The crowds went to the palace, demanding "punishment" for the "traitors" who signed the Axis pact. The new government announced that it would hold a national referendum to decide whether the Axis pact should be canceled. Seventeen-year-old King Peter I has firmly grasped power and asked the people of the country to support him in the event of war. This power is supported by the South Korean army. Demonstrations in the capital have intensified due to the coup, but anger has turned into joy. Cheerful crowds gathered in front of the British, Greek, and Soviet embassies, and anti-Axis slogans could be heard everywhere. The Greek Orthodox Archbishop of South Korea, Kafrylo, broadcast, "Yesterday's shame has been washed away. We must fight for freedom, even if we die unyielding, just like millions of other people in other countries." The new government has informed the people of the country that anyone who owns a car or motorcycle should immediately report to military personnel with their vehicles. Various military preparations are being accelerated in all directions. Thousands of letters and telegrams of loyalty to the royal family flooded into the palace. Former Regent Prince Paul has fled to Greece. Former Prime Minister Živković and former Foreign Minister Marković have both been arrested. Young King Peter issued a declaration stating, "Serbians, Croatians, and Slavs, at this critical moment for the nation, I have decided to take command of the military myself. The loyal and brave army and navy have immediately been placed under my command and have already been following my orders." The young king has entrusted full military power to the new Prime Minister, General Simović, who will immediately announce that the young king has reached the age of accession.

<h3>British Prime Minister Says South Korea Has Found Its National Soul, Eden May Visit South Korea</h3>
<p>London, British Prime Minister Churchill delivered an impromptu speech at the Conservative Party annual conference yesterday, stating that South Korea has "found its national soul" and that the new government may refuse to join the Axis pact. Churchill also said that Britain's recognition will be based on this refusal. "Britain will provide assistance to those who rise up to defend their common homeland when attacked, such as Turkey and Greece, to the best of its ability." (International News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>London, Prime Minister Churchill declared yesterday that he believed Yugoslavia would abandon the Tripartite Pact and defend its borders. Churchill made the remarks at a banquet honoring the new US Ambassador to Britain, Winant, saying, "Although I do not know the details of what has happened, and no one can be certain about any event, I believe there is reason to expect the Yugoslav government to abandon the Tripartite Pact signed the day before yesterday (Tuesday) and to defend its borders from invasion." Prime Minister Churchill promised to provide Yugoslavia with all possible assistance and also promised to provide assistance to Turkey. He said, "If Turkey is invaded, we will do our best to provide assistance." Those present applauded for a long time to express their approval. Churchill, with a pale face and a smile, continued to declare that he was often reluctant to explain Britain's war aims, but he believed that if the democracies were victorious, there would be an electrical atmosphere in the world that would lead to greater social unity and more justice than had been achieved in decades of peacetime. "When we see the souls of the heroic Serbians and Yugoslavs being sold by their weak and cowardly rulers to those who previously oppressed them and will later strip them of their lives and independence, we all feel sad. If the new government of Yugoslavia abandons the Tripartite Pact, Britain will recognize the new government and will do everything in its power to help defend the nation's territory, just as we are currently helping Greece. If Turkey is attacked, we will also give it the same assistance. When all our factories have handed over their production and the big factories have also produced new weapons, we will be stronger than we are now, but we are still strengthening every day." Reaffirming that Britain would do its best to provide assistance, Churchill said he was sure that President Roosevelt would be similarly moved by this generous sentiment of those who fought for freedom, "and in accordance with American law and the Constitution, he would allow him, as a great democratic leader, to lead the country forward. I am sure he will send all his sympathy to the Serbians. Therefore, at this time, we have ample reason to hope that the war can achieve results. The final result may still be distant, but it may also be closer than we estimate. You cannot really know it." Churchill also said to Winant that after the banquet, he could clearly understand again that Britain was determined to advance in coordination with the great American democracy until a way out was opened. Churchill reiterated that Britain's strongest labor and capital organizations welcomed Winant, which was noteworthy. This may be due to the high tradition that American ambassadors often have, or due to the focus of the war we are involved in, and most importantly, it is due to Winant's special personality and his service to the united labor and industrial movement. Winant also spoke at the banquet, comparing democracy and dictatorship. He said that when the British government needed greater power in an emergency to serve the interests of the public, the free people automatically gave the government strength rather than the government taking it forcibly by dictatorial orders. Democratic countries are now combining forces to confront an enemy, an enemy of medieval punishment combined with modern machinery and technology. At the banquet, Churchill and Winant praised each other. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital, Unconfirmed reports here yesterday stated that as a result of the Yugoslav coup, British Foreign Secretary Eden may visit the Yugoslav capital. Officials are reserving criticism of the developments in Yugoslavia and maintaining a wait-and-see attitude. As for Eden's current whereabouts, nothing is known. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Undersecretary of State Expresses Strong Willingness to Provide Economic Aid to South Korea</h3>
<p>Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that if South Korea is forced to resist aggression, the United States is willing to provide full assistance. The US ambassador to South Korea has been instructed to inform the South Korean government that the change of regime in South Korea is very welcome to the United States and is regarded as something to be celebrated by those who love freedom. President Roosevelt may, according to the Lend-Lease Act, provide effective material assistance for the sake of US national defense to countries that wish to maintain their independence and integrity against aggression. Welles also stated that South Korean assets in the United States, which were announced to be frozen this week, may now be released. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington, The talk here is about the South Korean coup, which is regarded as the most pleasant news since the British and Greek victory over the Italian army. People here believe this is Hitler's first major diplomatic failure, which will have a significant impact elsewhere, not just in the Balkan Peninsula. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>New York, According to Yugoslav Consul Gavrilović, thousands of Yugoslav expatriates in the United States are ready to fight for freedom. He said, "We are all brave fighting people. Although our army is small, it will give the aggressor an unexpected resistance." (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Germany Asks New Government Whether It Will Maintain Previously Agreed Pact</h3>
<p>Berlin, According to reliable sources, the German government yesterday demanded that the new Yugoslav government immediately state whether it supports the alliance pact signed by the former Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. According to a report from the German government news agency, Staphanillo, the commander of Belgrade (the Yugoslav capital), issued a notice urging the people to obey the instructions of the municipal government and maintain order and tranquility. The Serbian militia groups announced their allegiance to the new King Peter II. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>South Korea Still Willing to Maintain Trilateral Friendly Relations with Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>Nanking Capital, The new South Korean government notified the German and Italian ambassadors yesterday morning that South Korea is eager to maintain friendly relations with Germany and Italy. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>London, The silence of the Axis powers regarding yesterday's developments in South Korea is noteworthy. According to a German news agency report, qualified sources in Berlin warned that as of yesterday afternoon, they had not received "reliable information about the South Korean incident." Therefore, official and semi-official circles in Berlin are not expressing any attitude towards this matter. Furthermore, Radio Rome broadcast that Italian officials also had no opinion on the events in the South Korean capital. Italian officials received a telephone report from the Italian Embassy in the South Korean capital. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital "Swiss News Agency just released a Roman message stating that after the coup in Yugoslavia and the young King Peter II personally assumed power, Italian political figures have not yet shown any reaction and want to wait for news in order to understand the truth of the coup in South Korea. Although the newspapers unanimously published the speech to the people issued by Peter II, they did not comment on it. Only the 'Italian Daily' published an article, which stated that 'After the South Korean Cvetković cabinet decided to join the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact, Britain did not hesitate to use one of the most powerful cards to cause major difficulties in the political situation in South Korea after joining the alliance. This is very obvious.'" (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Rumor That German Mechanized Units Have Moved from Romania to the South Korean Border</h3>
<p>South Korea, South Korea rushed to send 1,200,000 troops to key points on the border, so the military launching period in the Balkans this morning is imminent. It is reported that this move by South Korea is the new government's response to Germany's recent spy document. News said that at the same time, the German mechanized units in Romania and Bulgaria are now moving to positions near the eastern border of South Korea. Last night, the pro-government Simović cabinet held an emergency cabinet meeting for two hours to discuss South Korea's "yes or no" response to Germany's request to participate in the Tripartite Pact. It is reported that the deadline set in the German spy document will expire this morning. It is reported that the British Ambassador to South Korea, Campbell, and the US Ambassador to South Korea, Lane, have assured King Peter and Prime Minister Simović that if war occurs, Britain and the United States will provide material assistance to South Korea. General Simović appealed to the public at midnight, saying, "Demonstrations are very dangerous, as they may damage friendly relations with neighboring countries, so we must avoid them." The South Korean Prime Minister urged the public to return to normal. Demonstrators carrying British, American, Greek, and Soviet flags traveled through the streets all night, and large groups of people were madly cheering in front of the aforementioned embassies.

<h3>Enduring Combat Strength: China Cannot Be Conquered by Force; London Times Discusses the Far Eastern Situation, Believing That Matsuoka's Diplomacy Will Hardly Succeed</h3>
<p>LONDON - The "Times" today published a special article titled "Chiang Kai-shek's Resistance," speculating on the possible results of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Moscow and the capitals of the Axis powers. It stated that Japan is now determined to obtain certain benefits from the Tripartite Pact. During Matsuoka's stay in Europe, he will make every effort to personally inspect whether Japan's future actions should involve advancing southward in Asia, coinciding with Hitler's spring offensive, or whether Japan should make China concede certain sacrifices to break away from the Axis.</p>
<p>Matsuoka's Trip to Europe: Much Speculation</p>
<p>China has engaged in much speculation regarding Matsuoka's trip. The general public believes that Matsuoka will first conclude a trade agreement with the Soviet Union, thereby using this as the first step in his diplomatic victory and as a stepping stone to concluding a more profound and comprehensive political agreement, namely a non-aggression pact. Regardless of the actual value of the non-aggression pact, its signing could allow Japan to transfer a large portion of the 300,000-strong Kwantung Army currently stationed in Manchuria for southward expansion. Matsuoka will press Moscow to cease supplying China with military supplies, undoubtedly using the recent friction between the Kuomintang and the Communists in China as material for slander. Tokyo desires, moreover, to see the New Fourth Army facilitate the split of Nationalist China. During Matsuoka's stay in Berlin, he will personally inspect the Axis powers' chances of victory, as the Lend-Lease Act has opened the door for a continuous flow of American military supplies into Britain, giving hope like last autumn. If Hua feels satisfied with this, then the date for Japan's southward adventure, coinciding with Hitler's long-planned offensive, will be agreed upon. Furthermore, because the Axis powers and Japan are far apart, this move will require technical cooperation to eliminate the significant obstacles that may arise and to prevent the United States from interfering in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Finally, an agreement will inevitably be made regarding how to distribute the spoils of war in Asia. If Matsuoka feels doubtful about the Axis powers' victory, then he will be unwilling to gamble the Japanese Empire on a single throw of the dice, risking repeating the mistake of Suvorov. Therefore, he may hint to London and Washington that Japan is prepared to withdraw from the Tripartite Pact without requiring any sacrifices from the Allies and the United States, but with certain sacrifices imposed on China. In short, Matsuoka is determined to use the Tripartite Pact, which only benefits one side of the Axis, as a bargaining chip, and will only make concessions if Japan receives equal benefits in return.</p>
<p>Japan's Southward Advance: Feint to the East, Attack in the West</p>
<p>The question that arises today is whether China will seize the opportunity to reconcile with Japan if Japan attacks Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. The answer is that Chongqing has firmly stated that it will not. In the eyes of the Chinese, Japan's southward advance is merely a feint to the east and an attack in the west. Japan's threat to China will not be eliminated in the slightest because of it. Japan's ultimate goal is to conquer China, which it can never forget. Tokyo intends to merge the two countries into a large economic bloc, which is strategically easier than defending islands stretching thousands of miles across the ocean, from Kamchatka in the north to Darwin in the south. China's millions of square miles of fertile land can supply Japan with the food and raw materials it needs, and its 450 million people can be exploited, exhausting their energy and sweat in Japanese industries. Conquering China would also provide Japanese goods with a vast and immensely profitable market. Therefore, the southward advance is merely an attempt to temporarily place China in cold storage, to be taken out again when the time is right. Furthermore, once Japan conquers Vietnam, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies, it can gain new strength upon completing the southward advance and re-attack the Chinese mainland. China will then be completely isolated. With Japan straddling Vietnam and Thailand, it can sit comfortably and cut off the transportation on the Burma Road, block the path of Australian reinforcements to Southeast Asia, and directly affect the Indian Ocean situation in relation to the Suez Canal and the Mediterranean Sea. At that point, both China and Britain will find it difficult to move an inch. The Burma Road is now China's lifeline, allowing foreign supplies to enter the country and domestic products to be exported abroad, and Singapore is the fortress defending Burma. Another important economic point, little known, is that China's invisible exports will also be severely threatened.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Love Their Country and Enthusiastically Contribute</p>
<p>The number of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines is estimated to be no less than eight million. The amount of capital they have invested in the revival and industrialization of free China is as high as 800 million yuan. The donations they have made to their motherland's disasters have enabled the government to use the funds originally designated for relief to purchase military supplies, accounting for more than a quarter of China's total military expenditure. If the Japanese occupy or control the aforementioned areas, these overseas Chinese will not be able to find a foothold and will be expelled en masse, and their property will be seized entirely. As a result, the continuous inflow of donations and foreign exchange into China will cease. Not only will economic factors be endangered, but spiritual factors will also be jeopardized. China is currently pursuing a policy of united resistance, regardless of the sacrifices involved, until the goal of victory is achieved. Its struggle is not only for its own survival but also to resist tyrannical rule and defend the rule of law. In his recent great speech, President Roosevelt stated that obedience can only be enforced by force, but loyalty is different; it comes from within. This inner feeling is based on clear facts and contains ancient concepts. Today, Britain, Greece, China, and the United States are all like this. He also said that China's ability to cope with facts and its derision of realism, which are often part of their philosophy, have now been joined by a new concept of military efficiency under Japanese pressure.</p>
<p>China's Great Army: Five Million Strong</p>
<p>The Chinese have a traditional saying that "good men do not become soldiers," so their army completely lacked modern training. However, today, a large army of five million men has been trained, and a portion of them have become well-trained guerrillas. They have also created an industry for manufacturing weapons and have General Chiang Kai-shek, an extraordinary military talent, as their commander-in-chief, as well as several other commanders with remarkable combat achievements. When Japan started the war, it claimed that the Imperial Army would go on a parade and return in three months (the war against China is still undeclared, referred to as an "accidental incident"). However, after fighting in China for more than three and a half years, it has achieved nothing. When Hankou fell, the military stage of Japan's conquest of China came to an end, and the stage of static and attrition warfare began. China, relying solely on its large population, has been a powerful weapon against Japan's most intense blitzkriegs. China's great human resources and its inexhaustible natural resources, after being utilized, have produced astonishing results. China's ancient history and culture have given its leaders and people courage, strength, and vision. The aid provided by Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is gradually strengthening China's defenses. China can now calmly wait for victory to arrive. Its commander-in-chief has always held the view that Konoe's fantasy of defeating China into submission will never be realized. When the capital fell, China was isolated and helpless, and the situation was extremely precarious. However, German envoy Trautmann's persuasion of Chiang Kai-shek to negotiate peace with Japan ended in disappointment. Today, if Germany tries to mediate again, it will undoubtedly fail.</p>
<p>Japanese Fears Increase Daily</p>
<p>The Japanese people's anxieties about the future of the war can no longer be concealed. In January of this year, Konoe first admitted that peace was nowhere in sight. In March, General Tanaka told the Diet that there was no need to crush the Chongqing government by force; it was only necessary to engage in economic development in the occupied areas to disregard Chongqing. Japan now has as many as one million soldiers serving in China, and the number of dead and wounded is even greater. The army's supplies are mostly obtained locally. It is said that in 1940, 60 percent of its military grain was seized from the Chinese and paid with military scrip that could not be used for purchases, causing the people in the occupied areas to be in danger of starvation. Even with this convenience, the Japanese army still suffers greatly, because it controls the trade in the occupied areas and refuses to pay the economic value of "cooperation" to the occupied areas. Cotton exports from China to Japan have fallen by three-quarters, making it impossible to make up for war expenses. Because China has suffered from the war and because Japan deliberately destroys property in the coastal and central provinces, its losses are of course far greater than those of Japan. What is strange is that the "Nanjing government," which governs the richest provinces in China, still relies on the drug trade run by the Japanese army for its political expenses. When the Chinese army retreated into the interior, the cultural and industrial circles followed. Students who go to the interior are still attending classes as usual, and many administrators come from those schools that have been reformed in remote areas. As for students traveling thousands of miles to the interior, it is because they risk being killed if they are captured by Japanese soldiers. Seventy machine workers in Ningbo dragged machines weighing 200 tons by handcarts, trekking for months through the mountains of Chongqing, despite being bombed by Japanese planes from time to time, and finally reached their destination and put the machines into operation. The Chinese Industrial Cooperatives are organized by this strong workers' group. There are now 20,000 cooperatives of varying sizes. This patriotic spirit is a new phenomenon in China.</p>
<p>Japanese and German Conspiracies Will Never Succeed</p>
<p>China's vast territory and large population make complete military occupation impossible. It can free up millions of people to take up arms to defend the country and millions of people to generate wealth for the country. All of these are decisive factors in spirit, strategy, politics, and economics. China will not be intimidated or fall into the trap of a conspiracy for peace. General Chiang Kai-shek once said, "The revolutionary Chinese spirit cannot be overcome and does not know the meaning of the word 'defeat'." This clear truth has been revealed and is in everyone's mind. Nazi diplomats stationed in Chongqing have clearly stated that Germany has not recognized the "Nanjing government" because Hitler does not want to hand China over to Japan. Although this makes Japan very unhappy, Germany still does this because the Germans suggest that it is wiser to cut off a limb than to lose one's life. This conspiracy will not succeed. China will not be deceived into negotiating peace with Japan, allowing its enemy to fully attack in the South China Sea. Considering China's preparation to fulfill its full responsibility in this struggle, Matsuoka's plan to sacrifice China and withdraw from the Axis will not succeed. This is obvious.

<h3>Philippine Army Conducts Defense Exercises; Air Force Strength Greatly Increased</h3>
<p>MANILA - The Philippine Army was fully mobilized today for its first major exercise in two years, scheduled for ten days. Thirty U.S. Army officers are assisting in the exercise, while other American officers are scattered throughout the Philippine Islands to observe the strength of the trained Philippine reserve army. In the event of war in the Pacific, they will command the 150,000-strong Philippine army. 23,000 men are participating in this year's exercise, and will receive intensive instruction and training within the limits allowed by the short period. The U.S. Army has decided to train Filipinos in preparation for war. Ten bombers, originally destined for Thailand, but detained here by order of the State Department, have been received after five months of delay and debate, greatly increasing the air strength of the army in the Philippines. Currently, there are three pursuit planes, one reconnaissance plane, and one squadron of bombers. It is understood that a large number of heavy artillery pieces have recently arrived here, including 155mm and 105mm types. The larger ones are for heavy-duty missions, while the 105mm guns are used as light artillery and howitzers. Although the supplies shipped to the Philippine Islands have increased in recent months, Philippine officials still want to obtain ordnance and ammunition for the Philippine Army for national defense.

<h3>Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs Today; City Education Association and Others Jointly Telegraph a Reprimand to Mao Zedong and Others; Schools Close and Fly Flags at Half-Mast to Mourn</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) Today is the Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs, also the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. Public and private schools at all levels in the city will, in accordance with the academic calendar regulations, uniformly close for one day and fly flags at half-mast to mourn. In accordance with the environment, no ceremonies will be held, but it is determined to strictly abide by the President's instructions, work hard in national salvation education, and complete the great task of resistance and reconstruction. The Shanghai Municipal Education Association and the nine educational organizations, including the Secondary School Friendship Association, believe that since today is the anniversary of the revolutionary martyrs, recalling the deeds of the revolutionary martyrs and their fighting spirit makes them feel even more the need to unite and complete the task of resistance and reconstruction. However, Communist Party Senators Mao Zedong and others refused to attend the Senate meeting because their proposed so-called "solution" and "temporary solutions" were not achieved, which is sufficient to affect the psychology of national use and destroy the spirit of unity. Therefore, they jointly issued a regular reprimand. The Dahua News Agency reporter recorded the original text as follows:</p>
<p>Educational Organizations Telegraph Reprimand to Mao Zedong</p>
<p>To Senator Mao Zedong in Yan'an, and also to Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, Lin Zuhan, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, and Deng Yingchao: Upon reading the newspapers, we learned that you, sirs, proposed so-called "solutions" and "temporary solutions" because the government disbanded the New Fourth Army and detained its chief officers, and threatened not to attend the Senate meeting. The whole country was shocked upon hearing the news. It is widely believed that you, sirs, usually speak of unity and resistance and reconstruction, but everything you do is to disperse unity and destroy resistance and reconstruction. The guarantees you provided in the twenty-sixth year have long since destroyed your credibility, causing pain to those close to you and joy to your enemies. If you, sirs, can still prioritize national affairs, you must repent as soon as possible. But until today, we have not heard any expression from you. Do you truly intend to abandon yourselves and sever ties with the 450 million Chinese compatriots? Unifying military orders and rectifying military discipline are necessary conditions for establishing a nation and are related to the success or failure of resistance and reconstruction. The Soviet Union's reorganization of its army is a lesson not far away. How could you, sirs, not know this? The government disbanded the rebel army in order to rectify military discipline and to strive for victory. But you, sirs, disregarded the overall situation and used this as a threat. We truly do not know what your intentions are. Now, the people of the whole country are eagerly hoping that you, sirs, will rein in your horses before it is too late and not go down a path of no return. Our association, etc., also take this day of the Commemoration of Revolutionary Martyrs to give you, sirs, this final loyal advice. What to do and where to go is up to you, sirs, to choose. Shanghai Municipal Education Association, Secondary School Friendship Association, Secondary Education Research Association, Secondary School Discipline Research Association, City Sports Association, Art Education Research Association, Primary Education Research Association, Boy Scout Academic Research Association, and the Compulsory Education Advancement Association, etc. offer our respects.</p>

<h3>Grain: Imported Rice Premiums Still Rebounding; Small Filtered Rice Seen Again at a $4,000 Premium</h3>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive in droves every day, with stockpiles steadily increasing. Even after accounting for recent sales and re-exports, warehouse inventories have still increased by 40,000 to 50,000 bags. Therefore, the rise in rice prices is entirely due to speculative manipulation, caused by large players raising prices and blind buying following suit. Although there has been some outflow to various occupied areas and Japanese merchants are buying broken rice, the total amount is less than one-third of the new arrivals. Actual sales in the city are only half, while warehouse additions and those not yet on the market account for one-third. However, rumors continue to circulate in the rice market, claiming that two ships carrying rice from Hong Kong were intercepted by an unspecified party, and that a large batch of February futures sold by Jian Yuan Foreign Firm will not be settled upon expiry. This has led to competition between actual sales and speculative trading. Large players are taking advantage of the opportunity to hoard and create artificial scarcity, causing premiums in the gray market to soar, often by $200 to $300 at a time. The premium for white-bodied small filtered rice opened at $4,000, then $3,900, reaching $4,100 to $4,200 in the mid-market. The premium for Zhongguan rose from $1,700 to $3,900. No. 1 Saigon was at $3,400, rising to $3,600; No. 2 Saigon rose from $3,500 to $3,800. Subsequently, actual sales slowed, and speculators rushed to sell, causing the market to stabilize. Then, large players also emerged, leading to an oversupply and a drop in premiums of $100 to $200. As a result, the premium for white-bodied small filtered rice was $4,000, Zhongguan was $3,800, No. 1 Saigon from Siam was $3,500, then $3,200 to $3,300, No. 2 Saigon was $3,500 to $3,600, fire-filtered rice was $3,500, and Tokyo polished rice was $3,600 to $3,700, while broken polished rice was $3,200. Compared to the morning market, the afternoon saw a sharp increase of $500 to $600, then $300, resulting in a steep rise of $4 per dan (a unit of weight), which was completely unexpected and due to the lack of regulation in the rice market.</p>
<p>Due to the surge in imported rice prices, domestic rice varieties such as thick and thin japonica rice saw a firming of sentiment among sellers, who uniformly raised prices. However, local stores showed little interest, so while prices rose, they could not match the pace of imported rice, increasing by only one or two dollars. Common varieties of special japonica rice, even with higher base prices, were unable to rise further, remaining stable at $124 or $122-123. Thin rice from Kunshan was offered at $120, then $112, while thin indica rice from Qingjiao was offered at $113, with no sales of original packages.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also trended higher across the board, and its demand increased. Not only did retail stores adopt it, but large players also stepped in to absorb it, making holders optimistic and prices soar. As a result, it increased by about $3. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened high from $108, then $103, while glutinous green beans were at $97, then around $90 for broken ones.</p>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive in abundance. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang vessel brought 12,863 bags from Hong Kong, arriving yesterday evening and docking at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. The Java Company's Chisarik vessel also brought a large shipment of imported rice, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning and docking at the chimney pier in Pudong for unloading. The exact numbers will be confirmed and reported later. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Flour: Strong Arrivals and Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's imported flour market continued to trend higher and firmer. In terms of supply, a large number of shipments have already arrived, such as the Golden Dragon brand of Canadian flour and the Steamboat Western Cow brand, totaling no less than 400,000 bags. Although arrivals are plentiful, they are being held by hoarders who are unwilling to sell cheaply. Given that the cost of new orders from abroad is above $31 per bag, while the market price is still above $30, speculative trading is very active, resulting in strong arrivals and sales. Australian flour (Clock Tower brand) rose to $30.03-0.04, and Golden Dragon brand also requires over $30. Amidst the rice price surge, the market is short of circulating capital, so market prices are unlikely to fall in the short term.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market remained firm. Gao Du wheat was offered at over $50, but there were no transactions. Japanese factories were also receiving very little, with prices between $45 and $46, with daily receipts of only 100 to 200 bags.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Falls and Rises Immediately</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil market continued to be manipulated by speculators, with the market moving from small to large. Initially, many bears, influenced by the previous day's weakness, were eager to cut their losses, causing both futures and spot prices to fall by $1-2. However, due to the large bulls (cotton yarn dealers) holding firm and even adding to their positions, the defenses became stronger. In addition, those who were taking advantage of the situation pushed prices up, causing the market to reverse and exceed the previous day's prices. Spot oil rose by $1, while futures rose by about $3. Transactions included 200 dan of factory oil at $103, rising to $105; 120 barrels of Dalian oil at $140 to $142; 1,500 barrels for April delivery at $139.50, rising to $144.75; and 2,000 barrels for late April delivery at $1442 to $146.50. Peanut oil also turned from flat to firm, with prices rising by another $1-2. Transactions included 30 pieces of Yantai raw oil at $119, 400 cans of another oil at $159 to $160, and 500 cans of Jiangbei local workshop canned oil at $155.</p>
<p>Today, 3,000 bags of corn are being shipped to Yantai, 1,835 bags of soybeans to Xiamen, 507 bags of sorghum to Xiamen, 365 bags of sesame seeds to Hong Kong, and 600 bags of soybeans to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: Black Market Exchange Rates Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC rates remain flat. Black market exchange rates for British and American currencies continued to weaken, due to the coup in the south and the possibility of cooperation between Japan and Germany following the meeting between Japanese Ambassador Matsuoka and Hitler. Speculators began to fear a potential conflict between Germany, the US, and Japan. China Bank and Bank of Communications continued to sell, while Japanese and foreign banks showed interest. Therefore, although the underlying trend was weak, it remained stable. The strongest trading for the day was 3 pence 165625 and 5 yuan 34375. However, at closing, the British pound was at 3 pence 125 and the US dollar remained at 5 yuan 34375. The results were up 0.03125 and 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The trend for April futures was similar.</p>
<p>Japanese Banks Aggressively Buy British Currency</p>
<p>In the early morning, London spot and forward rates fell 0.0625, while New York silver prices and London gold prices were flat. Exchange rates between the US and the UK, and between the US and Shanghai, remained unchanged, while the rate between the US and the UK was stable, and the rate between the US and Shanghai was up 6 points. Central Bank rates remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling rates of 3 pence 111875 for British currency and 5 yuan 28125 for British exchange, unchanged from the previous day. Speculators initially entered the market, and Hong Kong Electric followed suit, causing the market to strengthen. Transactions included 3-month forward US exchange at 5 yuan 34375 and spot British exchange at 3 pence 134375. HSBC rates remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax remained flat. Subsequently, Japanese banks aggressively bought spot British currency at 3 pence 25. At that time, US exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 34375 was difficult to settle. Later, with China Bank and Bank of Communications selling, the US exchange market finally firmed. At closing, the British pound was at 3 pence 25, and the US dollar was at 5 yuan 34375.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Electric Continues to Sell</p>
<p>The market opened slightly firmer for the US dollar and continued to be slightly firmer for the British pound. Spot and current month rates at 3 pence 265625 were available, due to Hong Kong Electric continuing to sell. Soon after, it was heard that HSBC sold spot US exchange to an American bank at 5 yuan 34375. Subsequently, speculators suddenly came in to cover their short positions in US exchange for the current month, making 5 yuan 34275 difficult to settle at one point. However, at closing, the British pound was at 3 pence 25, and the US dollar was at 5 yuan 34375. British currency for April was at 3 pence 234375, and US exchange was at 5 yuan 3125. The results were up 0.01225 and firmer by 0.0625 compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Market Generally Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 28th (Friday) - The exchange market opened steadily this morning, with no changes in British, American, and Japanese exchange rates. Shanghai exchange spot rates fell by 1.5 yuan to 462.5 yuan (yesterday's closing was 464 yuan). At 9:20 AM, Shanghai exchange spot rates continued to fall by 1 yuan to 461 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it was reported as flat, with all exchange rates generally unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Reported Weakness</p>
<p>Tianjin, 28th (Friday) - The exchange market opened weak this morning. London telegraphic transfers weakened by 0.09375 to 1 pence 40625, and New York telegraphic transfers also weakened by 0.125 to 5 yuan 59375. Shanghai exchange rose by 3 yuan to 94 yuan. "Joint Notes" in the black market rose sharply by 3 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen to 64.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Bearish, More Selling Than Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw the open gold market continue to decline, falling several times past the 6,500 yuan level. Due to weak exchange rates, Shanghai West Side gangs continued to sell, and sentiment was generally softening. Securities firms (Yi Da Xiang Xing Yong) and HSBC merchants (Da Feng) were selling, and most retail investors were short, with more selling than buying. Therefore, after opening in the morning, it rose falsely to 6,552 yuan, then declined further, falling to 6,505 yuan in the afternoon. Unexpectedly, the US exchange rate stopped weakening and suddenly recovered, causing short sellers to rush to cover, and securities firms (Tong Kang Yong) and banks (Heng Ji) aggressively bought, pushing the price up by 40 yuan, but ultimately still fell by 39 yuan. After closing, rumors of a conflict between the US and Germany caused it to suddenly drop to 6,518 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 230,000 taels. For carry trades (March rolling into April), sellers offered a discount but buyers still wanted 50 yuan. There were no cash transactions in the morning. In the afternoon, Yong Feng Yu sold 20 taels to Bei Qing Yun, 200 yuan higher than the futures price, approximately 70 yuan lower. Ornament gold, customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Open Gold Futures Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Since morning, exchange rates have been reporting firmness amidst speculative selling, making the market even more volatile. The market opened 30 yuan lower at 9:15 AM, at 6,545 yuan. Cheng Ji aggressively bought, and Heng Ji bought, pushing the price up to 6,558 yuan. It was then heard that US exchange for the current month at 5 yuan 3125 was available, triggering selling. Xiang Xing Yong Yi Da Xin Yuan Gong Da Ming Feng came to sell, causing the price to immediately fall by more than 30 yuan, to 6,525 yuan, which was absorbed by Cheng Ji Xiang He, causing it to rise again to 6,542 yuan. Exchange merchants Da Feng Yi Da De Cheng Heng Ji again aggressively sold, and with US exchange at 5 yuan 34375, China Bank sold, causing the price to fall again by more than 30 yuan, to 6,508 yuan. Chi Da Shun Yuan came to buy, pushing it up to 6,523 yuan. The morning closing was at 6,511 yuan. The afternoon market opened at 6,510 yuan, down 1 yuan. Next, it was seen at 6,508 yuan, which was bought by small money shops and banks, pushing it up to 6,522 yuan. Xiang Xing Yong Da Feng came to sell, pushing it back to 6,505 yuan. With exchange rates weakening, Heng Ji and Tong Kang Yong aggressively bought, and short sellers also came to cover, causing the price to suddenly rise by 40 yuan, reaching 6,545 yuan. Not long after, the market closed at 6,536 yuan, down 39 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Based on the closing price of US exchange for April at 5 yuan 3125, it was 6,555.3 yuan, a discount of 19.3 yuan. After closing, with rumors of a conflict between the US and Germany, Da Feng He Sheng Xin Yuan sold, pushing it to 6,518 yuan. The day saw a range of 53 yuan. The selling price of the cash market's own-brand gold was approximately 220 yuan higher than the open gold futures price. Buying was 80 yuan lower than selling. There is still no market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Still Hanging at Old Prices</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold in silver shops is still listed at 690 yuan per tael at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, with a 40 yuan discount for buying back.</p>
<h3>Japanese Notes Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw open gold prices fluctuating downward. British and American gold pounds each fell by 2 yuan, while British gold notes remained stable, with market prices standing firm. American gold notes trended lower, retreating to 18 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen in the evening market, down 1 jiao 2 fen from the previous day. Hong Kong notes showed a firming trend, with market prices standing firm. The decline in Japanese gold notes and Korean notes became more intense, with the former already retreating to 2 yuan 02 fen, and the latter already falling to 1 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bulls Driving Up Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gray market for public bonds continued to trend firmer, with Types A and D unchanged. Types C and E, on the other hand, were mostly driven up strongly by bulls, continuing to be abnormally firm, although not officially rising or falling. Because market trading was relatively light, it was easily manipulated by certain elements at closing. Official price movements still depend on favorable or unfavorable environmental news. The current situation is brewing, and future changes are bound to be significant, and cannot be viewed with excessive optimism. Yesterday's trading saw Shun Chang exclusively buying Type E for several days, while Xin Fu, Xin Hua, and Tong Kang also had a small amount of buying. In the afternoon, Xie Xing Yuan, San Kai, Hong Da, and Xie Da all had buying interest, while Lian Yi, Heng Kang, and Jiu Fu had selling interest in both the morning and afternoon. Others, such as Da Tong, Xin Heng Yong, Dun Yu, Lian He, Tong Xing, and Hou Da, were consistently selling. Market prices were still driven up by bulls at closing. As a result, most rose by 1 jiao or 3 jiao, while Types A and D had varying highs and lows. The total transaction volume was still only 1.6 million to 1.7 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 10 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 94 yuan jiao.</p>
<p>Corporate stocks were relatively more active, with prices generally maintaining their previous closing levels. Yangzi Bank's shares hit a new high of 18.5 yuan before closing. Jardine Matheson opened at 107.5 yuan, with buyers at 108 yuan at closing. Rubber shares showed mixed gains and losses.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Thursday) - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were generally sluggish, with no changes in prices.</p>
<h3>Yarn/Cotton: Yarn Market Difficult to Recover</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market continued to struggle to recover. Actual sales lacked bulk orders, and bulls were considering closing their positions, causing the market to decline. In addition, weakening exchange rates and falling gold prices significantly reduced the activity of large players, and the market lacked momentum. Selling pressure was quite strong. Fortunately, some short sellers covered their positions in the morning, and the first trade was at 1,394 yuan, reaching a high of 95 yuan. Subsequently, with no improvement in customer sales and scattered longs also closing positions, the market gradually fell to 1,384 yuan, the lowest price of the day. The market showed signs of oversupply. Subsequently, there was no lack of buyers taking advantage of the low prices, but they were also few in number, causing the market to return to 1,388 yuan at closing, down another 5 yuan from the previous day. There was approximately 10 yuan fluctuation throughout the day. Intra-industry speculation reached 4,760 bales. Miscellaneous brand yarn saw 168 bales imported from Hong Kong and 20 bales imported from the mainland, with prices also falling by 3 yuan. Shuang Ma Guang brand only imported 120 bales, with prices at 1,310 yuan, 70 yuan cheaper than factory prices. Today, 15 pieces of yarn are being shipped to Xiamen and 540 pieces to Hong Kong. The full-day sales of each trading group are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 240 Mainland 20</p>
<p>Industry 4,760 Total 5,020</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot cotton trading was quiet, with market prices generally stable. Factories did not purchase due to sluggish yarn sales, and there was little supply and demand among industry players, with only one transaction. Prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>American Penjamo 19.0 Industry 200 pieces</p>
<p>Indian Rangoon Cotton 205.0 Industry 20 pieces</p>
<p>The New York cotton market, due to the rapidly changing situation in the European Balkans and favorable news for bulls from Washington, saw renewed optimism and an active market. As a result, closing prices were up 4-5 pound notes compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to European exporters selling, then recovered slightly due to support from large players. Finally, it fell again due to rumors that cotton shipments to China would be suspended. As a result, closing prices, except for Yamla, which rose 4 rupees, all fell by 2 rupees. It is predicted that today's opening will be flat, only looking at a 1 rupee increase.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was still satisfactory, with both factories and industry players making purchases in recent days, resulting in an active and firm market, with prices rising by 2-3 yuan. However, because most holders of goods are not in a hurry to sell, and factories are still not making large purchases, the total transaction volume is not large.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Varying Inventory Levels Lead to Differing Cloth Prices</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was peaceful, with a number of month-end maturing goods being resold. Industry players continued to take in goods, so the market remained firm. Customer sales continued sporadically. Prices varied depending on inventory levels, with white goods, coarse cloth, and light-weight cloth all increasing, with increases of 1 jiao to 5 jiao per bolt. There was a shortage of coarse twill, with Da Tong Flying Goose brand opening at 45 yuan, up 5 jiao. Fine cloth and fine twill prices remained unchanged, and dyed cloth prices also changed little. Transactions in the city totaled over 500 pieces of various cloths. The Zhejiang and Fujian trading groups handled coarse and fine cloth and blue cloth, while the Guangdong and Yunnan trading groups handled fine twill, coarse cloth, and Shilin cloth, totaling over 200 pieces. Today, 20 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Xiamen and 950 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to rise as hoarders continued to absorb supplies, increasing by about 1 yuan. The association's clearing prices for spot goods saw No. 24 coarse white sugar at 87-88 yuan per this warehouse, up 1 yuan; 86.5 yuan and 87.5 yuan at other warehouses, up 1 yuan and 7 jiao, 7 yuan and 2 jiao, up 1 yuan to 7 jiao; end-of-March delivery at 86.8-87.8 yuan, up 1 yuan 1 jiao; April 10th delivery at 87.4-88.2 yuan, up 9 jiao; April 20th delivery initially at 88 yuan, 88.5 yuan, and 89 yuan, then softening slightly to 88.5-88 yuan, then rising again to 88.5 yuan, 88.8 yuan, up 8 jiao; Dutch red sugar at 68 yuan, up half a yuan; Taikoo brand white sugar B mark at 88 yuan to 88.8 yuan, 88.6 yuan, 88.5 yuan, and 88 jiao, with similar increases for lower grades; DY mark at 84.4 yuan, HX mark at 83.5 yuan, and crystal sugar at 114 yuan, also up 1 yuan. Yesterday, 1,100 bags of sugar were shipped from Hong Kong, and today 3,000 bags are being shipped to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>The Sweet Potato (Continued from the 28th)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>What are the differences between sweet potatoes and foreign sweet potatoes? Xu Wendinggong explained it best: "There are two types of sweet potatoes: one is called 'shan yao,' which is native to Guangdong as illustrated in ancient texts; the other is called 'fan yao'… The stems and leaves of the two are similar, but shan yao climbs trees while fan yao spreads on the ground; shan yao is lumpy, while fan yao is round and long. As for the taste, fan yao is very sweet, while shan yao is inferior!" This distinction can be described as hair-splitting! The books cited earlier describe sweet potatoes as "like fists, like bones, like goose eggs, like chicken eggs," all of which are descriptions of their lumpy shape, which is very different from the "round and long" shape of foreign sweet potatoes. And the "red sweet potatoes" known to every household in northern China, some with yellow flesh and abundant juice, have a color and fragrance resembling honey; others with a white center and abundant starch, known as "chrysanthemum hearts" in the north, have a flavor that surpasses even the chestnuts of Liangxiang! Sweet potatoes with excessive water content and weak flavor cannot compare.</p>
<p>Although sweet potatoes and foreign sweet potatoes are indeed the same species, how did they have a falling out and separate to establish their own identities, each going their own way? This question, as Coutiere of France would say, is not a simple question of the "plant's" origin, but rather a question of the origin and distribution of the world's "humanity!" Because this plant not only has a long history on the continents of Asia and America, but its traces can also be found everywhere on the islands of the Pacific Ocean. In particular, the Maoris, the most culturally advanced people on New Zealand, believe based on ancient legends that sweet potatoes were born with them. Therefore, if it is said that the introduction of this plant was in Asia, then the people of the New World migrated from Asia; otherwise, the opposite conclusion would be drawn. Let us wait for the final verdict of the ethnologists!</p>
<p>Finally, we know that Xu Wendinggong, after first obtaining the seedlings of foreign sweet potatoes and recognizing their great benefits, based on the compassionate heart of a good prime minister who wanted to "eliminate hunger among the people," was willing to promote the planting, consumption, wine-making, and other uses of foreign sweet potatoes, as a means of promoting them widely, believing that "the ancients said: vines have six benefits, and persimmons have seven wonders," while foreign sweet potatoes far surpass them, having "thirteen advantages!" This visionary promotion of sweet potatoes is comparable to the efforts of Gerarde in England and Parmentier in France to spread potatoes, and can be placed alongside them as shining examples! Leaving aside Xu Wendinggong's contribution to first introducing Western science to China, just the act of spreading sweet potatoes alone is worthy of our gratitude and commemoration with a bronze statue! But if it weren't for bringing up old stories today, who would remember him as the great hero who advocated sweet potatoes? Only to see the portraits of Gerarde and Parmentier standing majestically overseas…</p>

<p>Editor's Note: The transplantation of sweet potatoes to the north, including the twists and turns, can be found in my History of Food and Political Affairs in China Through the Ages. I once read a note from a predecessor stating that plant names preceded by words such as "West," "Sea," or "Foreign" are mostly products of overseas migrants. I believe that his description is not detailed enough and cannot be fully trusted, but it cannot be said that there is no reason at all. I hereby append this note, but regret that the name of the book has been forgotten and cannot be found. (End)</p>

<h3>Public Works Department: Responsible for Chartering Ships, Transporting Rice from Rangoon to Shanghai, Approximately 20,000 Tons per Month; Establishes Subcommittee to Manage Purchase and Transport Matters</h3>
<p>According to a public announcement by the Public Works Department, it was stated that during the regular board meeting held last Wednesday, the board of directors resolved to appoint directors Mitchell and Mindsdell to jointly study the food situation with the department's Food Subcommittee and relevant parties. A report has now been submitted, and the board of directors convened a special meeting on the afternoon of the 27th to carefully discuss the matter. They all agreed that the current issue is the transportation problem. There is no shortage of rice reserves in Shanghai at present, and the reason for the rice price increase is due to public concern about the source of supply. The Public Works Department does not wish to interfere with reliable business methods unless absolutely necessary. On the contrary, it is willing to support and strengthen them.</p>
<p>Clearing Shipping Lanes to Transport Rice to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the two directors, based on the facts gathered, the root cause of the rice shortage panic and high prices is the lack of ships between Shanghai and Rangoon. As for transporting rice from Saigon to Shanghai, it is believed that there are sufficient ships available. However, shipping between Shanghai and Rangoon is currently not smooth due to the global situation. Therefore, the urgent task is for all relevant authorities to make every effort to clear the shipping lanes and transport rice to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Establishing a Committee to Handle Matters Specifically</p>
<p>As a result of the meeting's discussions, it was decided that the subcommittee, on behalf of the department, would find ways to charter ships to transport 15,000 to 20,000 tons of rice from Rangoon to Shanghai each month until the situation improves. The quantity to be purchased will be adjusted at any time depending on the local reserve situation. Regarding the chartering of ships, it is believed that it will be more successful if the committee handles it than if ordinary merchants do so.</p>
<p>Limited to Retail Sales in Shanghai</p>
<p>Once ships are chartered, it is planned to entrust them to reliable rice import merchants. The freight charges will only be sufficient to cover charter fees and incidental expenses. When placing orders, the committee will instruct the carriers to reserve the empty space on the ships solely for transporting cheaper rice. Furthermore, the contract with the rice merchants should specify that this rice can only be sold in Shanghai and is limited to retail sales to members of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association for sale to households. If any violation of the above regulations is discovered, the committee may refuse their next order and publicly announce their names. This plan was decided after consultation with neighboring authorities, and it is hoped that the authorities can take similar measures to clear shipping lanes.</p>
<p>Striving to Establish Reasonable Prices</p>
<p>If Shanghai has a normal and sufficient supply of rice, there will be no need to manage rice prices. This should still be entrusted to normal rice businesses to establish reasonable prices. The department will seek the assistance of the Shanghai Rice Merchants Association to ensure that rice transported to Shanghai through chartered ships is only for retail sales.</p>
<p>Hoping Rice Merchants Will Still Supply Needs</p>
<p>It should be solemnly stated that the department does not intend to manage all rice imports and distribution. It only wants to manage the rice transported to Shanghai through chartered ships. It is hoped that normal rice businesses can continue to operate to meet the demand for high-priced goods in Shanghai and supply the needs of other cities.</p>
<p>Rice Reserves are Surprisingly Large</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee yesterday that the committee's current rice reserve survey (from last Thursday to this Thursday) was officially completed yesterday. The total number of rice bags in more than sixty Chinese and foreign rice warehouses throughout the city reached 841,275, an increase of 38,570 bags compared to the previous period. Among them, the first was Kung Ho Hsiang Shun Tai, totaling 166,679 bags, the second was Lung Mao, with 102,804 bags, the third was Taikoo, with 55,418 bags, the fourth was the Bank of China, with 54,843 bags, the fifth was the Chekiang Industrial Bank, with 50,835 bags, the sixth was Mao Tai, with 45,636 bags, and the seventh was the Chekiang Industrial Bank, with 23,571 bags. The remaining warehouses all had more than 10,000 bags. The above rice reserve figures are limited to Chinese and foreign warehouses. The amount stored in rice shops and by residents has not yet been investigated. According to the person in charge of the committee yesterday, the amount of rice stored is also more than 600,000 bags. Therefore, the total amount of rice stored in the city is about 1.6 million bags. Calculating consumption at 10,000 bags per day, the above rice reserves are enough for the city's four million residents to eat for more than five months. Therefore, there is no shortage of food for Shanghai residents.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Arriving in Shanghai in an Endless Stream</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions actively sought to clear the source of foreign rice, it has gradually achieved results. The number of arrivals has been quite large recently, and large quantities of foreign rice are still en route. According to news from the shipping industry in Shanghai yesterday, within the past ten days, 200,000 bags of foreign rice will be transported from South China to Shanghai. The reporter also learned from the rice industry that Taikoo's "Soochow" ship arrived in Shanghai on the 16th. The ship carried 19,215 bags of tribute rice from Hong Kong and docked at Taikoo Wharf in Pudong. In addition, the company's "Kansu" ship also arrived here from Hong Kong on the 27th. The ship carried 9,265 bags of tribute rice from Hong Kong and docked at Taikoo Wharf in Pudong for unloading. The Hanyang ship also arrived yesterday, also carrying 12,863 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. In addition, the Java Company's Chishari ship also transported a large amount of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docked at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong for unloading. The French postal ship D'Artagnan arrived the day before yesterday (26th), carrying 55,398 bags of foreign rice and 15,153 bags of Dutch rice directly from Saigon, and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading.</p>
<h3>Central, China, and Jiangsu Farmers' Banks Can Resume Business Immediately</h3>
<p>According to responsible sources who spoke to the Great China News Agency, the Central, China, and Jiangsu Farmers' Banks have received telegrams from the Ministry of Finance ordering them to resume business as soon as possible. They have been actively preparing, hiring workers to repair damaged houses and sorting out business that was suddenly interrupted. Most of the preparations have been completed, and they are scheduled to resume business on the 31st of this month. The staff of each bank usually live peacefully, but after this incident, they are inevitably a little wary. However, the bank will provide effective protection for the safety of the staff at work so that they can work with peace of mind. At the same time, each bank itself is determined to continue its efforts to maintain Shanghai's financial stability as its responsibility lies. Recently, there have been rumors that the Central, China, and other national banks will withdraw from the French Concession. The reporter inquired about this one by one with the staff of the above-mentioned banks, and they all said that it was purely unfounded and not credible. It is also reported that the Central Bank usually has a spring vacation of four days every year, which was from April 1st to 4th last year. This year, it is feared that it will be the same as before. Therefore, it is also rumored that the bank's resumption of business may be after the spring vacation.</p>
<h3>Manager of the French Concession Water and Electricity Company Changes; Contract Expires on the Third of Next Month</h3>
<p>The manager of the Shanghai French Concession Water and Electricity Company, Fa Fulei, was promoted from deputy manager to his current position four years ago. His contract expires on April 3rd. At that time, the company's head office in France will appoint someone else to succeed him. It is reported that the former manager, Ke Saier, returned to Shanghai from France last week and will temporarily take over the position of manager because the deputy manager, Hai Yinci, has recently retired. It is believed that the new manager is Mr. Du Keleisi, who is expected to arrive in Shanghai in late April. It is rumored that Fa Fulei will remain in Shanghai after his retirement, but his future whereabouts have not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>British and French Trams Connected Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the French Concession Water and Electricity Company labor strike, all tram workers resumed work the day before yesterday. Labor and management are still negotiating on all issues related to improving treatment. All trams in the two concessions have resumed operation. Because the French Electric Company has not yet handed over compensation for losses to the British Tram Company, they have not yet operated mutually after the workers resumed work. Yesterday morning, the British Company's No. 17, 18, 24 trolleybuses and No. 2 trams began to enter the French Concession. The French Company's No. 5 trams and No. 17 and 18 trolleybuses also simultaneously drove into the Public Concession. At this point, the part of the traffic that was open has been fully resolved. Only the part related to treatment remains to be negotiated between labor and management.</p>
<h3>The Entire City Will Fly Flags at Half-Mast Today to Commemorate Revolutionary Martyrs, Remember the Hardships and Greatness of the Founding of the Nation, and Vigorously Implement Frugal Construction and Strengthen Local Work</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. It has been designated by the central government as the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day. The death and martyrdom dates of all party and state veterans such as Deng Zhongyuan, Hu Hanmin, Liao Zhongkai, Chen Yingzhi, Huang Keqiang, and Zhu Zhixin will be commemorated on this day.</p>
<p>Citywide Flags at Half-Mast, Entertainment Stopped</p>
<p>The people of all sectors in Shanghai, in order to commemorate the difficulties and greatness of the sages who created China, have specifically designated today as a day for the entire city to fly flags at half-mast, stop entertainment banquets, engage in spiritual commemoration, stop unconscious gatherings, and promote frugal donation movements to strengthen the work of resisting and building the country. Since the authorities of the two concessions implemented precautions, the order has been exceptionally good. Today, they have decided to step up necessary measures, increase the number of detectives to patrol the roads and guard posts, and search suspicious pedestrians and vehicles. As for unnecessary alleys, roads, and bridges, they do not intend to block them.</p>
<p>Foreign Embassies and Consulates Take a Holiday</p>
<p>Today is the Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial Day. The embassies and consulates of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and other countries stationed in Shanghai will also be closed for one day to express their condolences. Except for temporary important official business, all business will be suspended and will resume office on the 31st (Monday). Yesterday, all foreign nationals were notified separately. Other institutions such as the Jianghai Customs, post office, courts, prisons, and all large and small schools and public groups will also follow the usual practice of taking a day off in addition to flying flags at half-mast to express their condolences.</p>

<h3>Coal Briquette Factory Labor Strike; Authorities Seek to Mediate; Arrested Workers Released</h3>
<p>After the coal briquette factory workers in Shanghai went on strike the day before yesterday, more than a thousand charcoal retail stores throughout the city also stopped delivering goods because workers were worried that they would be obstructed by striking workers when delivering goods. The Public Concession authorities believe that coal is a daily necessity for citizens, so they are making every effort to mediate. The Coal Industry Association also convened a meeting yesterday to discuss solutions, but the number of attendees was insufficient, resulting in a quorum not being met and the meeting ending without decisions. More than fifty workers who were arrested the day before yesterday for coercing non-striking workers and obstructing coal briquette delivery trucks were released by the concession authorities at 5:00 p.m. on the same day (the 27th) after interrogation.</p>
<p>Factory Side's Attitude</p>
<p>According to the factory side, the sudden strike by coal briquette factory workers was completely unknown to the factory beforehand. Most of the workers in the factory were also unable to foresee it beforehand. Only a few days ago, it was discovered that some people came to the factory to solicit workers to join the union. After the strike, there was no request made to the factory, so the factory had no way to contact them. Therefore, they can only request the authorities to find a solution as soon as possible to avoid affecting the lives of citizens. It is rumored that last month, the labor side made a request to increase wages by 40%.</p>
<p>Workers' Opinions</p>
<p>According to the workers, among all industries in Shanghai, other industries have improved their treatment in the face of rising prices, but only the workers in the charcoal and coal industry still follow the old practices of five or six years ago and adopt the lowest wages. Although there are a few manufacturers who have made slight improvements due to substantial profits, they are only a small fraction. Therefore, last month, after careful consideration, they prepared ten compromise plans and sent them to four colleagues in the industry for adoption and implementation. After waiting for a long time, they did not receive a reply. Then, they separately asked the authorities of both Shanghai and the concession to mediate. The four colleagues did not accept, which is why the workers went on strike.</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers from Fenghua in Shanghai Raise Funds to Relieve Famine in Their Hometown</h3>
<p>Fellow villagers from Fenghua in Shanghai, in view of the serious famine in their hometown, where middle-class families have money but no rice, and the common people are waiting to die, resulting in widespread misery and starvation, the situation is unprecedentedly tragic. They specifically invited fellow villagers from Fenghua in Shanghai a few days ago to hold a meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to establish the Fenghua Fellow Villagers in Shanghai Relief Fundraising Committee. Many members attended the meeting. Fang Jiaobo and Gui Yanfang from the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association also attended and participated. Zheng Yuanxing was elected as the chairman, Sun Xingzhi and Zhou Jingting as the vice-chairmen, He Mengxiong and Fang Jichuan as the finance committee members, Yu Hualong as the secretary-general, and Wang Lianfang and others as the standing committee members. Hong Xinfu and others were elected as fundraising committee members. The total amount of fundraising is 200,000 yuan. The fundraising period is until the end of April in the Gregorian calendar. The Zhejiang Local Bank, Siming Bank, Dalai Bank, and Rui Tai Silver Store are designated as donation collection points. It is heard that half of the donations have already been pledged on the spot. The remaining amount will be solicited by the committee members immediately.</p>
<h3>Storing Dangerous Materials Requires a License</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Public Works Department specially issued Notice No. 5417 yesterday regarding the storage of explosives, gunpowder, petroleum, and other dangerous materials. The notice states that anyone who stores materials that are dangerous in nature or sufficient to endanger life and property and can cause injury, and for public safety, special precautions are necessary, must apply to the department for a license in accordance with the provisions of Article 35 of the Land Regulations. It is hoped that the public will pay attention and earnestly comply with the notice.</p>
<h3>The Number of Directors is Being Negotiated; Elections May Be Avoided; Three Consuls-General Negotiate Through Diplomatic Channels to Maintain the Balance of Power in the Concession</h3>
<p>The next board election of the Public Concession Public Works Department has been postponed for a week after the announcement. Currently, British Consul George, American Consul Lockhart, and Japanese Consul Horiuchi are jointly consulting to resolve the issue satisfactorily through diplomatic channels. British community leader Casey (the current chairman) and Japanese Residents Group Chairman Watanabe are also conducting side negotiations. It is expected that there will be a full decision in the next two days, and a list of candidates will be formally submitted to the Public Works Department on April 1. According to well-informed sources yesterday, the election may be avoided.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States are Unwilling to Disrupt the Status Quo</p>
<p>The current situation of the Public Works Department is that there are seven British and American directors and seven Chinese and Japanese directors. The chairman is appointed by the British and American directors. The chairman only has the right to vote when the motions are deadlocked. If the number of Japanese directors increases by two in the next term, and the current Chinese directors encounter serious difficulties in the current environment, then the Japanese side can easily control the administration of the concession, which will disrupt the status quo. This is clearly not what the British and American communities want. Therefore, the three consuls-general have decided to seek a win-win solution in the negotiations, increasing the number of Japanese directors on the one hand and maintaining the status quo on the other. According to those familiar with the inside story,</p>
<p>Changes in the Number of People Must Maintain Equilibrium</p>
<p>The so-called win-win solution is nothing more than the following routes: (1) The number of British and Chinese directors is reduced from five to four, and the number of American and Japanese directors is increased from two to three. The British and American and Japanese and Chinese each occupy seven seats, maintaining the equilibrium. However, the reduction in the number of Chinese directors will inevitably arouse widespread opposition. Therefore, the Chinese directors will still be five, but one seat will be vacant in rotation as a compromise. (2) The British and Chinese directors are still five each, and the American and Japanese directors are increased to five each, which can also maintain the status quo. (3) The British and Chinese directors remain the same, and the American and Japanese directors are increased to three each to maintain equilibrium. Among the above three options, the latter is the most likely. Once agreed, the election can be avoided.</p>
<p>Date of Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers</p>
<p>Consul-General Hill recently issued a notice stating that the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers will be held on April 17 (Thursday). At that time, the method of raising municipal funds will be discussed, the relevant motions on fundraising will be passed, other municipal facilities will be decided, and the Public Works Department's accounts for the previous year will be approved. As for the location and time of the meeting, the Public Works Department will announce it after deciding.</p>
<h3>Citizens Should Not Give Money to Beggars; Chairman of the Shelter Suggests; Rotary Club Has Not Decided</h3>
<p>At the Rotary Club meeting the day before yesterday, the chairman of the club's Beggar Shelter Committee, Hague, made a suggestion, advocating that citizens should not give money directly to beggars, so that beggars throughout the city can be eliminated. It is said that it is better to use the money to help the poor than to give money to beggars every day. If this matter can be implemented, beggars on the streets will soon disappear. It is also said that giving money to beggars every day is tantamount to paying to encourage them to stay on the streets. Therefore, as long as someone gives money to beggars one day, beggars cannot be eliminated one day. Hague advocated that citizens should give what they give to beggars every day to the organization that can deal with the problem, which will be more effective than giving alms. He also asked Chinese and foreigners not to give alms to beggars for two weeks. However, the Rotary Club has not made any decision on this suggestion.</p>
<h3>Awaiting American Weapons to Determine the Sino-Japanese War; After the Arrival of American Flying Fortresses, the Chinese Army Will Launch a General Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>An editorial in the Continental Daily News said that the news about Dr. Corley's proposal to the US government to aid China, as reported by the New York and Washington newspapers, is indeed credible and there is little reason to doubt it. Corley traveled to free China, conducted an investigation, and said before leaving for the United States, "What China needs is very little, and what the United States can give is very much. I am sure that you will get all the assistance you need."</p>
<p>Corley's Proposal Will Be Approved</p>
<p>The proposal transmitted by Corley stated that China only needs 20 Flying Fortress bombers, 200 of the latest fighter planes, some aviation gasoline, steel war equipment, and some artillery and ammunition. All of these can be transported to China within a few days after President Roosevelt's approval, and it is certain that President Roosevelt will approve Corley's proposal, because President Roosevelt said in his recent speech, "China has asked the United States for assistance through Chairman Chiang, and we have replied that China will certainly receive our assistance."</p>
<p>Once War Equipment is Obtained, a Counterattack Will Be Launched</p>
<p>It is quite obvious that China is eager to obtain American assistance. Not long ago, Chairman Chiang said in a speech that China would launch a general counteroffensive and implement an effective counteroffensive as soon as it received the war equipment promised by the United States. Since there is an urgent need for artillery and aircraft, it is expected that the first batch of war equipment arriving in China will include artillery and aircraft. The Flying Fortress bomber is most useful to China. Since the start of the war in the summer of 1937, China has been unable to counterattack Japan due to the lack of long-range bombers. Japan has repeatedly bombed the Chinese capital and other important towns, but after China obtains the expected famous American Flying Fortress, it will not only be able to fly to the most remote corners of the Chinese front line, but also be able to show its power in Tokyo and other extremely important cities in Japan. The arrival of these bombers and other military supplies in China will be a turning point in determining the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<h3>Airmail Service Opened Between Qingdao and Kaifeng</h3>
<p>A notice from the Postal Administration stated that airmail service has been opened between Qingdao and Kaifeng, with stops at Haizhou, Tongshan (Xuzhou), and Shangqiu (Guide). Flights depart from Qingdao and Kaifeng every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. In the future, airmail to Shangqiu (Guide) and Haizhou will be accepted by the Bureau and forwarded from Tongshan (Xuzhou). The entire journey will be carried by aircraft. Airmail to Kaifeng, which is currently forwarded from Peiping, will also be forwarded from Tongshan (Xuzhou) in the future. The additional airmail postage required is the same as that for other occupied areas in North China, Central China, and South China, that is, 36 cents of national currency for each 20 grams of letter or its odd number, and 18 cents for each postcard. In addition, from April 1 of this year, the airmail service between Shanghai and Guangzhou has been increased from two flights per week to three flights per week. This is to notify the public.</p>
<h3>Culture on Rue Lafayette</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Rue Lafayette is a fairly long and spacious road, leading directly to the Old West Gate in the east, now blocked by iron gates; it ends in the west at Avenue Joffre, where it connects with Route Tenant de la Tour. Traffic has also become more convenient in the past two years. There are Route 21 buses from Dapu Bridge to the Bund on Avenue Edouard VII, and Route 24 trolleybuses from Route Robert to the Old West Gate passing through, gradually making the eastern half of Rue Lafayette prosperous. West of Rue Luban, there are bright, wide sidewalks on both sides, where you can stroll under the tall plane trees, while admiring the flowers and trees in the French park and residential gardens, and listening to the little birds singing in the branches, making music for the strollers. That's quite interesting. But I love the short stretch of this road at the east end even more, the distance from Route de Saypoce to Route Baron Gros, nearly two hundred yards, which is full of lively atmosphere and new vitality. Although the stalls on both sides block the road and the city sounds are noisy, this is not enough to detract from this section of the road.</p>
<p>In addition to Datong University and Middle School in the Lawyers Association building, there are seven or eight small schools in the nearby area. There is also a church. Every day in the morning, noon, and evening, several hundred male and female students go to school or return home from school, passing through. These school-age children wear different colors of clothes, carrying schoolbags, running and jumping to school or home. Some are pretty, some are ugly, some are clean, and some are ragged; but they are all full of innocent childishness and pure beauty. I like to stroll on this section of the road when these children are released from school, mixed in with the crowd of innocent children, walking back and forth, listening to them talking and laughing along the way, or learning to sing a new song that their teacher has just taught them. Their happiness seems to make me return to their school age and feel the same happiness. Sometimes, when it's time for school lunch, I wait at the school gate to greet my children when they come out of school. When they suddenly find their father waiting for them at the school gate, how happy they are! Just like when mom and dad come home from outside and suddenly bring them many exquisite snacks, candies, or toys, the children feel the same unexpected happiness. Therefore, my children often want me to greet them in front of the school gate at lunchtime, but I always tell them that I will not come again. But I often linger in front of their school's church in the afternoon when school is dismissed, where there are also some ordinary grass flowers and evergreens planted. Children always like their parents to give them unexpected favors.</p>

<h3>Salvation Army Brigadier Bertje Morris Transferred to Serve in Canada; Has Been Engaged in Disaster Relief in China for Twenty Years; Awarded Certificate by the Chinese Government for His Hard Work</h3>
<p>Salvation Army Brigadier Bertje Morris, who has been engaged in Salvation Army disaster relief work in China for twenty years, is scheduled to leave Shanghai on April 5 to serve in Canada. As for where he will be transferred to in Canada and who his successor will be, it is still unknown.</p>
<p>Distinguished Work and Hard Work in China</p>
<p>Mr. Morris was originally from Salisbury, England, and was trained at the Salvation Army International Training College in the United Kingdom. He was sent to China in November 1921 to learn Chinese and was sent to the Chinese mainland after six months to promote the Salvation Army's work. He was supported by the Chinese government and Madame Chiang Kai-shek. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Mr. Morris came to Shanghai from Nanjing to provide relief to refugees, sparing no effort. Recently, he also opened a beggar shelter. The Chinese government has awarded Mr. Morris an honorary certificate for his outstanding service in China. Mr. Morris will travel to Canada with his wife and young son.</p>
<h3>King of Slot Machines Arrested Again - Escaped from American Prison Before - Arrested and Bailed Out in Shanghai, then Fled - Changed Name and Hid, Finally Recaptured</h3>
<p>The English language "North China Daily News" reports: Jack La Rue, the "King of Slot Machines," was accused of running gambling dens in the United States. Last year, after being detained, he was released on bail and fled to avoid punishment. However, the American authorities were very diligent in their pursuit and finally discovered that Jack had changed his name to John Beck and was</p>
<p>hiding in Hongkou,</p>
<p>at 24 Yangcun, Zha Pu Road. This morning (the 28th) at 9:45 AM, the American authorities dispatched Enforcement Officer Teteilberg, together with officers from the Shanghai Municipal Police and Japanese police officers, to the address. They went straight into Jack's bedroom but did not find him. After searching the attic on the roof, they finally discovered Jack hiding inside and arrested him. He was taken to the American authorities for a brief interrogation and then sent back to the Ward Road Gaol. It is expected that the American authorities will soon open the trial of this case. Jack had</p>
<p>fled to avoid punishment,</p>
<p>gaining only three months and fourteen days of freedom. It is noted that Jack was arrested in front of the Great China Theater on September 20 of last year. He was imprisoned in the Ward Road Gaol and, after a few days, was released on bail of US$25,000. When he was tried in the American authorities on February 4, the authorities had already determined that Jack had committed a theft in the United States more than ten years ago, been sentenced to 25 years in prison, and escaped from prison. Because both crimes were exposed, Jack</p>
<p>finally fell into the clutches of the law.</p>
<p>In recent years, Jack has been running gambling dens such as "slot machines" in Shanghai, accumulating a considerable fortune. He currently owns the New Manhattan Tavern. It is rumored that Jack won the tavern by gambling with dice.</p>
<h3>Morphine Hidden Inside Walnuts - Totaling Eight Hundred - Main Culprit Wang Fukui on the Run</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhide, a 34-year-old man from Haizhou, arrived in Shanghai recently on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Ding Sheng" steamship from Incheon. At 5:00 PM on the 17th, when he arrived at the Roosevelt Wharf (i.e., China Merchants Wharf) on the Bund in the French Concession, he was carrying a burlap bag of walnuts in his luggage, containing between 1600 and 1700 nuts of varying sizes. Detective Qian Xishan inspected the luggage. Out of curiosity, he picked up a walnut, cracked it open to eat the meat, and unexpectedly found a small waxed paper packet inside. He opened the packet and found it contained the drug morphine. He immediately detained Zhang for questioning. According to his confession, there were a total of 800 walnuts, which had been split open, the meat removed, and paper packets of morphine inserted. The shells were then glued back together to deceive inspectors. The goods were brought from Tianjin to Shanghai by Wang Fukui, who was waiting at the Yong'an Hotel on Daxin Street in the British Concession. Detective Qian immediately took Zhang and the evidence back to the police station. He then worked with the Zhabei Police Station to send detectives to the Yong'an Hotel to arrest Wang Fukui. However, Wang had already fled after hearing the news. The detectives reported back to the police chief, who ordered Zhang to be detained pending investigation and legal proceedings. At the same time, a warrant was issued for the arrest of Wang Fukui for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of University Student - All Bandits Have Been Arrested - Principal Offender Liang Yuxu Was a Former Detective - Car Used in Kidnapping Also Recovered</h3>
<p>Cheng Zeji, residing at 834 Connaught Road, was studying at Fudan University at 574 Hart Road. At 1:50 PM on the 18th of this month, Cheng drove his own car, number 3895, to the school to study. Unexpectedly, near the school gate, he was suddenly confronted by several kidnappers armed with weapons.</p>
<p>They blocked the car and, under threat, forced Cheng into the car prepared by the kidnappers, number 7546, and drove quickly westward. When the car passed the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Haig Road, it happened to encounter a search team from the Public Concession Police. Sensing an opportunity to escape, Cheng jumped out of the car, injuring himself in the fall. The kidnappers, realizing they were exposed, also drove away. Cheng was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Recently, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station have successively arrested</p>
<p>the criminals involved in the case, including 21-year-old Ningbo woman Wang Wenying, and Li Jiliang, Zhang Hongxiang, Dong Jinchun, Wang Xiaoerzi, Dai Jinbiao, and Mark Bai. According to Zhang Hongxiang's confession, there was another accomplice named Liang Chengyu who was on the run. At the time, there were two pistols, which were stored with Liang. There was also a car (i.e., the one driven by the kidnappers at the time), which was purchased on March 20 for the price of 2,000 yuan and is now hidden at 909 Beile Road in the French Concession. The police went to investigate and indeed recovered the car, number 7546. They then went to a certain hospital at 19 Peng Road and</p>
<p>arrested Liang. It was found that Liang, also known as Zheng Guang, was originally from Shandong. He used to be an undercover detective in the Public Concession Police, but was later detained for a kidnapping case and sentenced to life imprisonment. Liang appealed and had his sentence reduced to seven years of imprisonment. He was released after serving his term, and several years have passed. Now he has been arrested again on suspicion of kidnapping. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, requesting permission for detention and joint trial. The court ordered that Liang Chengyu be detained pending further review at a later date.</p>
<h3>Two Cars Collide on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at approximately 8:45 AM, a streetcar of a certain line of the Public Concession, traveling from Jing'an Temple towards the Bund, was passing in front of the Women's Bank on Nanjing Road when a Japanese naval soldier riding a motorcycle came speeding from east to west. When the motorcycle was about to pass the streetcar, the naval soldier driving the motorcycle did not follow the rule of "keeping to the left," causing it to crash directly into the streetcar. The driver of the streetcar braked urgently but could not avoid the collision. The motorcycle was slightly damaged, and traffic was temporarily halted. As a result, the streetcars were all blocked and stopped, extending to the edge of the racecourse like a long snake. Traffic was disrupted for more than forty minutes.</p>
<h3>Extortion of Bookstore Owner - Two Criminals Arrested for Investigation</h3>
<p>Li Hongfa, the owner of the Dajiang Bookstore at 502 Avenue Edward VII, suddenly received a threatening letter delivered by gangsters on the 25th of this month. The letter contained strong language and demanded 1,000 yuan, instructing Li to send the money to a certain book stall at 619 Avenue Edward VII. The person coming to collect the money would be holding a copy of the "North China Daily News" as a sign. Li reported the information to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched detectives Wang Shilian and Xu Shutian to wait in ambush. They placed a paper package, made to look like 1,000 yuan in legal tender, on the book stall. The day before yesterday afternoon, Ke Baolin from Danyang and Liu Dajue from Shandong came and took the paper package, hiding it on their person. They were arrested by the detectives and taken to the police station. They confessed that the scheme was masterminded by Huang Jinrong, who was at large. They were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, requesting a postponement. Judge Liu questioned the two defendants briefly and ordered them to be detained pending further review at a later trial.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Large Sums Leads to Conviction</h3>
<p>Wu Xinhai, from Ningbo, residing at 9, Lane 195, Macgregor Road, previously partnered with Xu Yecheng to open the Wan Tai Hardware Store at 540 Ningbo Road. Recently, Xu discovered that Wu had embezzled 37,500 yuan in goods and entrusted lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to report the matter to the police station. The police dispatched detectives to arrest Wu Xinhai and bring him to the First Special District Court. The court ordered Wu to post 30,000 yuan in bail to be released pending judgment. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu presided over the Second Criminal Court and sentenced Wu Xinhai to eight months' imprisonment for continuous embezzlement of items held in the course of business. A civil suit was attached, to be transferred to the Civil Court for trial, with the stolen goods to be returned to the owner.</p>

<h3>Principal of Lequn Middle School, Tao Guangchuan, Suddenly Arrested - Usually Enthusiastic About Education - No Other Activities</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:21 PM, seven people from a certain quarter, along with a foreign detective, suddenly broke into the office of Lequn Middle School at 970 Avenue Edward VII and conducted a thorough search. At the time, all teachers and staff were also under surveillance. They then broke into the principal's office and bedroom on the second floor and searched repeatedly, but found nothing. At 3:30 PM, these eight people took Principal Tao Guangchuan away. It is noted that Principal Tao is the founder of Lequn Middle School. He is usually enthusiastic about education and works hard for the public. He has no other activities. Therefore, the reason for this arrest is difficult to guess. It is heard that Principal Tao is currently detained in the Central Police Station.</p>

<h3>The Power of Blood</h3>
<p>— Yan Zheng</p>
<p>Blood is never shed in vain, nor will it be shed in vain.</p>
<p>The blood of the seventy-two martyrs finally stirred up the surging revolutionary tide, finally destroying the throne of autocracy.</p>
<p>The Northern Expedition... all the same. In a word: bloodshed!</p>
<p>Being stingy with blood is wrong. It should be shed as needed, shed.</p>
<p>The debt of blood needs to be repaid with blood. Fearing to shed a drop of blood only leads to more blood being shed, shed in vain.</p>
<p>Commemorating the martyrs should not be just lip service, on paper. We should understand the value of blood and strive for the price of blood!</p>
<p>Women</p>
<h3>My Cheekbones</h3>
<p>— Qiu Sheng</p>
<p>I dare not call myself a liberated modern woman, but in education, I have enjoyed the "equality between men and women." Like ordinary men, from elementary school, middle school, to university. This can also be said to be a rare gain for a few women in the clamor for "liberating women"!</p>
<p>I don't know whether I should celebrate or mourn this precious gain because I have come to know more of the pain that women should not have.</p>
<p>A woman's appearance is more important than her learning. If you don't believe me, look at the wedding hall, plastered with magnificent gold-lettered banners like "talented man and beautiful woman" and "scholar and beauty." Why should they praise women with "appearance" and men with "talent"? I think this is at least somewhat insulting to women. But, it was like this in the past, and it is still like this now.</p>
<p>If I were a man, I might be called a handsome and capable beautiful youth, but unfortunately, I am a woman. Don't think I'm an ugly girl with thick eyebrows and big eyes. I'm not bragging at all: I have fair skin, and well-proportioned ears, eyes, mouth, and nose. The only flaw is that my cheekbones are slightly high. Isn't it true that high cheekbones on a man would only add to his handsome and capable appearance? But I am not a man!</p>
<p>"A woman with high cheekbones kills her husband without a knife." When I was studying in a girls' middle school, many female classmates criticized me this way behind my back. I was startled by their comments. I secretly often touched my raised cheekbones in the mirror. I feel very sorry for them, what bad luck to be born on a woman's face! I thought again: What relationship do a woman's cheekbones have with her husband? I laughed, laughing at those classmates who criticized me, for being unscientific. If female students are like this, it's no wonder ignorant old women in the countryside are superstitious!</p>
<p>But rock-solid facts are the most powerful arguments. What else can I say?</p>
<p>Ten years ago, when I was a sophomore in college, I fell in love with a sophomore in engineering, and he loved me too. In less than a year, our feelings surpassed friendship, and in the spring of the second year, with the consent of both parents, we got engaged in Shanghai. We both felt that our marriage was proceeding smoothly and were very satisfied. Yes, the classmates were all envious of us. We planned to hold our wedding in the first winter after graduation. If possible, we also wanted to take our honeymoon trip in the spring after the winter. Like ordinary young women, I was looking forward to a beautiful future life. Alas! Who knew that this was just a fantasy, a fantasy that could never be realized!</p>
<p>It is truly a case of "rare misfortune," unfortunately falling on a woman with high cheekbones like me.</p>
<p>During a summer vacation after we got engaged, my fiancé contracted a seasonal epidemic and passed away. The news was like a bolt from the blue, and I cried for several nights because of it.</p>
<p>But, society is ruthless. It not only refuses to show any sympathy to those who have been severely wounded but makes the heartbroken even more sad.</p>
<p>My fiancé died, and thus "A woman with high cheekbones kills her husband without a knife," was confirmed and spread throughout the school. From then on, my classmates became distant from me, as if my cheekbones could not only kill my husband but also harm friends who were close to me. So, I began to feel lonely. At the same time, I felt particularly sorry for my slightly high cheekbones.</p>
<p>Yesterday the weather was very nice. I was sorting out my clothes in the sunlight and inadvertently found my fiancé's portrait, which had been pressed under the box for more than ten years. Ten years ago seems like yesterday. The person in the portrait is still smiling at me, but I am no longer the person I was ten years ago! My heart now is like a dry well, no longer stirred by waves! I have been rejected by the people around me, labeled with terms like "husband killer" and "widow waiting at the gate"! I have been shrouded in the giant hand of the devil, the giant hand wants to push me into the dark abyss. I cannot break free from the shackles left by the old society. Although I have new ideas, where can I go to express them?</p>
<p>I am old, spring belongs to young people, but among young women, who can guarantee that they will not be born with high cheekbones formed by physiology? I held my smiling person in the portrait and cried bitterly.</p>
<h3>Good Education</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The best education in the world comes from the struggle for survival. Because this is also the most practical knowledge.</p>
<p>The secret of education lies in respecting and recognizing students. Therefore, teachers with high academic qualifications are not necessarily the best teachers.</p>
<p>Investing in knowledge often yields the highest interest.</p>
<p>It is absolutely not permissible to only educate children to become gentlemen or ladies. Educate them to become useful men and useful women. (Walking University).</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(5) The Division Between Love and Desire</p>
<p>Xiangqi had been standing right behind him all along, answering his questions very quickly, but this time she deliberately did not answer.</p>
<p>"Is he your cousin?" Begonia suddenly turned around and asked bluntly.</p>
<p>Xiangqi couldn't help but chuckle.</p>
<p>"Cousin? Did he tell you that himself? How can this person not guess! He is my own brother, and he is still recovering from his illness in the south. We were closest when we were little!"</p>
<p>"Why couldn't I be born into her family?" Another regret, Begonia thought.</p>
<p>But the further he flipped, the more regrets he had because many of the photos were not of Xiangqi alone. Some of the people who were photographed with her were relatives, and some were classmates. In Begonia's eyes, these people were all very lucky, which made him feel inferior.</p>
<p>Until the mute maid brought out a basket of freshly steamed meat buns, he hadn't seen the last page.</p>
<p>"When are you planning to return to Beijing?" Xiangqi asked after eating a few buns with her special guest and putting down her chopsticks.</p>
<p>"I don't want to go on stage for the time being, so it doesn't matter if I stay here for a few more days." Begonia almost wanted to say, "I hope to be able to talk to you often, as long as Yuan, the Garrison Commander, doesn't come, I won't leave."</p>
<p>Although he didn't say the words, Xiangqi had already understood them in her heart.</p>
<p>"You can come here for lunch tomorrow. As long as we are careful, you can come here often."</p>
<p>From then on, Begonia did come to the Luo's house three times in a row. In both form and spirit, they couldn't help but reveal a kind of passion, but both sides knew how to restrain themselves. Even in the most excited moments, they would only smile at each other.</p>
<p>Later, almost all the performers and his subordinates in the troupe went back. Zhao Si also repeatedly told him that if there was nothing important, it would be better to return to Beijing sooner. At the same time, Yuan Shaowen also sent him a quick letter, telling him that he had returned to Beijing from Chengde and saw the telegram he had sent a few days ago. He didn't know if the Tianjin matter had been settled and hoped that he would reply in a letter as soon as possible, or simply return to Beijing to discuss it in person. This made Begonia decide to leave the next day. (67)</p>

<h3>"Red-Headed Woman"</h3>
<p>— Huang Xinde</p>
<p>"Red-Headed Woman" is about the life story of the actress Li Silians Kader. There have been many Hollywood works in the past that have used the background of actresses as themes, so the theme of "Red-Headed Woman" is not necessarily new. However, the story itself has many joys and sorrows, so the performance is quite moving.</p>
<p>The story begins with Li Silians losing her beloved son due to divorce. Then, it writes about her suffering social criticism, so she is angry and goes to act, hoping that after she becomes famous, she can regain her beloved son and social warmth. However, although she is successful in art, American society in the 19th century still despised Li Silians's personality. Her beloved son was separated from her for a long time and was unwilling to be close to her, so Li Silians had to work hard for art with a wounded heart.</p>
<p>Of course, the story of the whole film will not be so simple. Of course, it has to add her romantic threads. At first glance, it seems that the playwright is trying to criticize the feudal forces at the time, but the director takes this point lightly and tries to show how she struggled to embark on the road to success. For example, she was coldly received when she first took a letter of introduction to see the famous playwright Klaus Trelane, and she waited from dusk to late at night when she visited again. Finally, this playwright could not refuse his feelings and wrote a script for her. She then ascended the dragon gate and her wealth increased tenfold. These scenes are all where the director used all his energy to describe Li Silians's success, which was not accidental.</p>
<p>Although Manlin Hawkins is old and frail, she still feels that she is the right person to play such a middle-aged woman. Especially a woman like Li Silians Kader is particularly suitable for her personality, so the performance is even more moving. Among the supporting actors, the playwright of Klaus Trelane plays the best. This public is a versatile actor who can play any role. In this film, he just plays it even more brilliantly. If the director could have handled the climax of the whole play more powerfully, then the performance of this play would have been even better than it is now.</p>
<h3>Drama News</h3>
<p>— Jue Xin</p>
<p>Since Zhou Xinfang had a bout of exhaustion typhoid fever last year, he was so eager to go on stage that he did not take good care of himself, so he has not fully recovered his health. He relapsed a month ago. Fortunately, the illness was not serious, and after a very short period of rest, he met with audiences again. Unexpectedly, he fell ill again the day before yesterday, which made his friends who loved him very happy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter spoke to Zhou's wife on the phone, and she happily said that the old brand of Qilin has already taken medicine, and he is scheduled to go on stage tonight after the illness. This news is worth comforting to the fans of Qilin. As for Qilin's exhaustion and typhoid fever illness last summer, it was entirely caused by singing and performing voluntary performances for the Shanghai Actors' Association Preservation Committee too hard and too tiring. In the beginning, the Actors' Association had an incident of selling Liyuanfang, and Zhou Xinfang strongly opposed it. He published an article in the newspaper, calling on all the actors to retain their ancestral property. As a result, he received the sympathy of a group of young actors such as Gao Baisui, Zhang Yipeng, Li Ruilai, and Li Shunlai, who responded one after another. Only then did the Actors' Association dispel the idea of selling, and they organized a Preservation Committee to perform plays to raise money to repay debts. Xinfang was of course particularly enthusiastic about this matter, but after all, he was almost fifty years old, and he was physically exhausted, so he suffered a serious illness. Now that Liyuanfang has been completely redeemed, this credit naturally belongs to Xinfang.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain Qiong Pa</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Swallow Kicks Flying Flowers Falling on the Dance Banquet</p>
<p>Before Li Xin could answer, the woman in red, who had been paying attention, walked up slowly, gave Li Xin a blessing, and said in fluent Mandarin, "Master Li, please don't be offended. I have long heard that Master Li is a generous and righteous young man. Meeting you today is a blessing." Li Xin was originally about to explode, but now that he saw that these two people were speaking very humbly, and he had also seen that the woman's skills were not ordinary, the anger in his chest had long since dissipated, and he could no longer blame them. He could only say, "You are flattering me like this, I am ashamed to deserve it. However, I have always forbidden people to sell their art in front of my manor, so my servants came to drive you away. Now I forgive you for not knowing the rules, and I will ask you to stop performing at once. If you lack travel expenses, I can help you with some later." The big man and the scholar both smiled and thanked him, "Master Li's words are correct, we dare not disobey. We will pack up immediately and pay our respects to Master Li at the manor." After the two men finished speaking, they turned back and picked up the bamboo pole on the ground and packed up hastily with their companions. Many people watching the excitement saw that Li Xin had in effect given them an order to leave, but they were very obedient, which showed that Li Xin's power was formidable. The lively scene dispersed, and everyone else dispersed as well. Xu Jing was eager to go home, so he didn't stay any longer and said goodbye to Li Xin. Li Xin was now walking slowly towards the gate of the manor with his hands behind his back and his head down in thought. Turning around, he saw that the big man and the woman in red had brought their companions to the manor. He had spoken first, but he could not refuse, so he greeted them to the hall inside. After they were seated, the injured servant saw that the master not only did not avenge him, but brought the performers in, which was very strange, so he also came in to call out to Li Xin. When the big man saw him, he took out a plaster and said to the servant, "We were careless just now and offended you. Fortunately, it was not a serious injury. I will give you this plaster to put on. It will be completely fine after three days. Please forgive me." When the servant saw that the big man said this, and that Li Xin did not show any expression, he had no choice but to accept the plaster and retreat. (24)</p>
<h3>An Interview with the "Children's Drama Society"</h3>
<p>— Mu Er</p>
<p>Since the departure of the "Children's Troupe" from Shanghai, among the children's acting troupes, it seems that only one "Children's Drama Society" has achieved relatively noticeable results.</p>
<p>Recently, learning that the "Children's Drama Society" would hold its fourth public performance at the Ningbo Guild Hall to celebrate Children's Day, I went to conduct a brief interview.</p>
<p>Entering the drama society's door, they were rehearsing "Children's Day" and "King Kong". In order not to disrupt their work, I listened quietly on the side. It turned out that "Children's Day" exposes the different lives of students and suffering children on Children's Day. "King Kong" is a fairy tale play, depicting how the residents of "Happy Village" repelled King Kong thousands of years ago.</p>
<p>Later, I asked someone in the drama society about their past situation and future direction. According to him, the purpose of this drama society is to promote normal entertainment for children, unleash children's surplus energy, and have children perform plays for children, hoping to replace early morning movies with children's dramas. In the past, in addition to performing in large theaters, they also went to orphanages and other places to perform in rotation. This "Children's Day" is a collaboration with a certain orphanage.</p>
<p>After hearing such a description, I felt that the work of the "Children's Drama Society" was very meaningful. If they continue to work hard, the future is limitless.</p>
