<h2>Page 3</h2>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫加入軸心之後</h3>
<p>本月初，當保加利亞加入軸心，德軍源源開入保境之後，世人即知希特勒在正式進攻希臘前，必先壓迫南斯拉夫，使之繼保國之後，准許德軍假道；過去三星期中德國對於貝爾格拉德政府所施行的神經戰，其目標當不外乎此。據一昨報道，南國內閣經過長時期的辨論，業已決定與德義日三國簽訂議定書；加入同盟，但拒絕接受一切軍事性質的義務，祗准德國救護車和軍械過境，而不許軍隊假道。這種辦法，如果能邀希特勒的認可，則雖是屈服，然亦可視爲南國官民最近數月來努力維護獨立完整，準備流血禦侮的一點收穫；蓋其屈服的程度，確已較羅馬尼亞保加利亞兩國差勝一籌。加以南國內閣決策之際，一部份民衆的憤慨激昂，以及三位閣員的拂袖而去，至少還足以表示南斯拉夫人心未死；希特勒如果還想作進一步的勒索，難保不引起其他技節。</p>
<p>本來，自從匈牙利，羅馬尼亞·保加利亞三國相繼屈服之後，南斯拉夫已成希特勒所亟思染指的釜魚俎肉；而巴爾幹協商的無形解體，又使她完全陷於孤立。在軍略地位上，她更是差不多處於軸心勢力四面包圍的形勢中，雖有幾十萬尙堪一戰的陸軍，但因種族龐雜，國內意見未必完全一致。在外交方面，英國雖有庇護之心，苦於鞭長莫及；蘇聯當然十分關切，但是絕無實力相助的可能。在這種情形之下，南國之終必屈服，簡直是意料中事。從此以後，假定南國動盪的政權並無鉅變，國外又不發生足以改變巴爾幹現行局勢的重大波動，則這一第八個同盟國」的運命，仍將不免於淪爲德國的附庸；即使小在軍事上受德軍的佔領，至少將在經濟上政治上完全受納粹的控制。這種變相滅亡的悲運，原已覆轍相尋，司空見慣，亦自爲世人所深予同情，然吾人更欲加以注意的，還在南國入盟以後的方來演變。</p>
<p>假定希特勒果眞利用其在保加利亞南斯拉夫兩國境內所得到的軍事便利，揮師南下，以攻取薩洛尼加，從而向巴爾幹南端乃至近東方面擴大戰事，則以後的問題似乎當分兩面講：第一，要問希臘是吾一本初衷，不畏德國强大的軍事威脅，而決心繼續作戰？關於此層，吾人認爲絕無疑問，尤其是在英軍己在希臘登陸，美國援助法業經實施的今日，希臘更沒有半途而廢，功敗垂成的理由。何况希特勒是吾眞正預備在巴爾幹南端，造成一個新戰塲，以消耗其準備用於對英一擊的兵力，迄今還未能完全確定。第二，要看土耳其和蘇聯的反響如何？據前日哈瓦斯社電訊，土耳其外長薩拉卓格魯於最近飛往英屬塞浦路斯島，會晤英國外相艾登之前，曾與蘇聯政府迭决交換意見，並自蘇聯取得若干「保證」；可見此次英土兩國外長的會晤，不但有關土國態度的決定，抑且足以透露莫斯科方面的眞實意向。所惜截至目下爲止，英土蘇三國對於此層，竟完全諱莫如深。一說蘇聯曾向南斯拉夫勸告加入三國盟的，但反對准許德軍假道，又有一說，則謂蘇聯將與南國簽訂和三國盟的相類似的協定，以「保障」南國的領土完整；依照前說，蘇聯殆已承認德國對南所施壓力，在事實上無可抵禦，所以祗好勸告南國當局作有限度的讓步；依照後說，則蘇聯明明想用同樣方式，抵消德國對南斯拉夫的壓力，務使南國成爲「各不侵犯的緩衝地帶」。無論二說孰是，至少可以從此中尋出一點綫索；那就是蘇聯對於巴爾幹半島，暫時雖還不準備作積極的干涉行動，但仍希望盡可能地在這方面避免戰爭的擴大。因此，希特勒今後如果「按兵不動，」而僅以利用軍事優勢，壓迫希臘單獨媾和爲事，則蘇聯乃至土耳其的現行態度，或者仍將繼續若干時日。反之，如果德軍立即擴大戰事，甚至波及土國的海峽安全，則今後的巴爾幹半島難免沒有其他的驚人發展；凡此動嚮的岐途，究竟如何歸趨，將於納粹所謂春季攻勢的開展中，見其分曉。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（四）（一）歐戰戰略泛論</h3>
<p>這是英國著名軍略家郝德上校關於歐戰戰略的泛論，原文載紐約Herald　Tribune，茲譯錄於後：</p>
<p>美國重事評論家鮑爾溫曾在一篇生動透闢的文字裏說，「不列顚帝國的防禦，顚然建築在三大基礎之上：其一是海洋，不列顚帝國的偉大即基於此；其二是曼哲斯德和中部各地的機械，英國作戰的武器皆仰給於此；其三就是空軍。」</p>
<p>他又說，「現因戰局的推移，不列顚防禦觀念，實與戰爭開始前出版的郝德上校所著「保衛不列顚」一書中的論據大相遙庭，」此言未免使我驚異。</p>
<p>簡單言之，我的觀念不過說，我們應當以最大的力量集中於海空兩軍，而在陸軍方面的努力則减至最低限度。但須有充分的兵力，足以保衛我國的海外領土，並須有機械化的攻擊部隊，以對付德軍突破法軍陣綫時的情形。</p>
<p>這一個理論，絕非空洞，而是有實際根據的。若把我們的力量分散，而企圖使各方面無不堅强，結果必致顧此失彼，無一堅强，這是拿破崙所說過的重大錯誤。</p>
<p>要編成立强大的陸軍，不但非短時間所能辦到，且要耗費工業和財政方面的大量資源，這在維持海軍和編練堅强無比的空軍當然需要更亟。我自上次世界大戰以來，就一向主張制空權在二次世界大戰中將爲一個決定勝敗的因素。</p>
<p>我雖曾主張編練機械化攻擊部隊，以派往法國和中東方面作戰，但我也聲明過，大隊步兵分批開往歐陸，將有交通綫受空軍或機械化部隊攻擊和切斷的危險，交通一斷，則在法國境內的英軍，勢將進退維谷，陷入窘境。</p>
<p>因此反不如運用海空軍和機械化部隊所需以外的工業餘力，以近代配備供給法國，使他們訓練有素的大量陸軍得以增厚實力，這不是「有限責任的理論」而是履行「保存實力」的基本常識。遭受侵略的國家，唯有適當的支配他們努力的方向，纔能和時間爭勝，這是顚撲不破的眞理。</p>
<p>但是冷靜的策劃與比例的思想，都被感情和成見所掩蔽了。我們的盟邦，但求陸軍的龐大，而忽略了空軍和防空的設備。我們也在大難當前亟需致力於緊急措施之際，而輕重倒置，反去編練龐大的陸軍。</p>
<p>回溯往事，假使我們的空軍，能與德國並駕齊驅，戰爭原可不致發生，這應該是人所共曉的事實。即使戰爭不能避免，祇娘我們的戰鬥機和高射砲實力倍於去年夏天，或有少數機械化師團駐守要地，在德軍突破時立即反攻，則德軍侵法，將感束手，對英威脅，更將完全消除。要達到這種目的，本屬輕而易舉的事，却被軍事的傳統觀念所貽誤了。</p>
<p>在這一次戰爭中，法比軍隊，因戰鬥機缺乏，不能驅逐德國的急降轟炸機，以致失去抵抗能力。當德軍衝過塞當的時候，又因裝甲師的不足，無法對抗，使聯軍受到了致命的打擊。</p>
<p>一九三七年，我曾向陸軍部長倍立厦建議，編練六個裝甲師團，其中四師可開往法國作戰。但在一九四〇年五月，德軍進攻之時，英國還祇有一師可以派遣，而這師又駐在海峽的另一方面，並未能立即赴援。結果使我們派往法國的四十萬步兵式軍隊，被敵切斷聯絡，損失了大部份的配備，幾於赤手逃生。</p>
<p>鮑爾溫先生以爲我今日對於防禦力估計之高，不知是吾仍與我戰前所著「保衛不列顚」一書中相同。實則就過去的戰况看來，我祗有回答他說，假使對於雙方兵力和情况的比較，均能適當顧到，那麼我非但未把防禦的力量估計得太高，實際還估計的太低。我曾在書中發表這樣一段結論：就大體言之，採取攻勢的軍隊對於敵軍須有三比一的優勢，不獨在人數方面，且在飛機戰車等現代飛械化部隊方面亦須如此。</p>
<p>德軍對於現代防禦力的估計，似不在我之下，實則比我的估計或許還要高些。他們於未取攻勢之前，小心翼翼，先在飛機戰車等現代配備方面，造成三比一以上的優勢。據倫敦泰晤士報的可靠記戰，其飛機爲四與一之比，戰車則爲五與一之比。而且我與一班早先主張機械化戰爭的人，都曾聲明過，在未來戰爭中，非採取運動戰術和出奇制勝的方法不可，此次德軍在採取攻勢之時，對於這種新戰衛的要點，已確能盡量發揮了。</p>
<p>非但如此，關於優勢的比例，我在戰前所作結論中曾愼重說過，在某種狀况之下，優勢的比例即使不到三與一之比也可無妨。第一，祇須攻軍在戰略上運用「誘敵」之計，使敵軍空壁而出，呑我鈎餌；第二，須戰綫遼闊，使攻軍有充分活動的餘地，選擇敵軍防守菰弱之處，乘隙蹈瑕攻其無備：第三，攻軍宜利用新兵器或新戰術，出敵不意，使其失去扺抗力；第四則爲守軍統率無人，指揮失當。</p>
<p>我且曾說過，守軍必須飛機充足，力能保守領空之時，纔有抵禦敵方優勢陸軍的希望</p>
<p>德軍在實力上雖佔極大優勢，但仍謹愼小心，不願冒險向馬奇諾防綫正面攻擊。他們反去攻擊荷比等低窪國家，一方面把法軍誘離堅强防禦的工事，一方面又把戰綫盡量延長，以獲得廣大的活動空間，同時降落傘兵和重戰車，更使他們收到出奇制勝之效。</p>
<p>除這許多優勢以外，法國總理所說「法軍統帥部不可思議的錯誤，」亦使德軍的獲勝得力不少。英法軍隊不知憑堅扼守，以逸待勞，反輕離根據而前進七十英里，深入比境，以守達耳河上一無準備的防綫，這或許是因為政治上的關係而不得不然吧！</p>
<p>但是車事上實際的佈置，決不能藉此解釋。聯軍左翼全部向比利時西部推進，而在進攻樞紐約比屬盧森堡一帶，却一無防守，似係盲目運用正規的集中主力原則，和誤解亞丁區森林重疊，丘陸起伏，非敵軍機械化部隊用武之地，致有此種失着。（未完）</p>

<p>復工失敗</p>

<p>外滙昨日巿况、滙豐掛牌、仍無更動、英美滙暗巿、趨勢步緊、錄倫敦方面來電、認近來中國法幣之疲弱、乃中國平準金不欲支持黑巿所致、非中國平準金力不能爲之、實則不願為之、頃中英間現正進行談判、以期英金對中國平準金之援助、免用於支持上海黑市之途、俾得少一漏巵、故有謂平準會將有停止供給本市外滙之說、因之人心激動、其實此種舉動在應有之列、英美如欲維持法幣、則對於維持所供給之基金如何保持、最是一重要問題、此一問題無辦法、即是支持法幣之效力等於零、蓋維持之基金雖源源而來、而黑市塲之外滙、依然滔滔而去、則實際上所維持者非爲法幣、而　其惠者乃爲資法幣以奪取外滙之輩耳故英美不願維持中國法幣則已、如欲維持、必先對於上海黑滙　漏洞、如何堵塞、堵塞之道、不外乎停止外滙供給、此在其實行之初、似外滙之價激漲法幣之値暴落、實則正是法幣之價、從此以後、如金剛之堅、如日月之恒、顚撲小破、摧殘不盡、而一時滙價劇短所反映之法幣價値、乃是一種急於以法幣奪取外滙所造成之幻景、即爲一時之外滙需要突增、而供給叉有中斷可能、求之者衆、供給者少、遂似外滙珍貴非常、外幣慘落可懼、不知眞正之法幣對外滙率、只有見其高、不會見其跌、惟黑滙市乃適得其反耳、至於中國商人正當可靠之用途而需要外滙、在黑滙如果眞個停止供給、則經聲請許可所獲得之外滙、可下其較之從黑滙巿塲中所獲得者為長、故此舉　實現、只有使法幣之値提高、而非將法幣之値再行貶落、昨日一般洋銀行已在未雨綢繆、向黑滙巿塲結進外滙、遂使黑滙行市又見緊縮、日商方面所扒尤為踴躍、蓋恐此機會錯過發不易冉得、投機商亦進多出少、致市面易緊難鬆、午刻軟至三辦士二五、及五元三一二五、惟收盤卒吿三辦士二六五六二五及五元三四三七五、結果軋縮〇四六八七五及〇六二五、期貨尤稍較緊、</p>
<p>買風一時大盛</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期各縮〇六二五、紐約銀價及倫敦生金均平、滙兌　美對滬等俱無上落、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士三一二五、美滙五元四〇六二五、較上日均無榮辱、開後尙平、但不久本埠銀行界方面、忽有某種利多傳說、一時扒風頓起、日銀行與投機商互相購結、市面以是趨緊、計做開三月份、美滙五元四〇六二五及三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小〇二五、此後洋行界亦跟之扒結、情勢步軟、十時三刻英金已緊至三辦士二八一二五、美滙縮達五元三四三七五、嗣乃扒者稍减、曾吿轉平、現美滙五元三七五可結、套頭商曾有塞出、奈不久突聞倫教電訊、說平準基金委員會對於　海黑市、恐有不維持之說、扒風遂以重熾、洋行界及投機商又來結進、計做開三月份英金三辦士二八一二五及二五、又三四月份美滙五元三四三七五、午刻現美滙又縮至五元三一二五、英金軟達三辦士二二、惟收盤稍平、英金吿三一辦士二六五六二五、美滙爲五元三四三七五、而期貨英金則吿三辦士二五、美滙則爲五元三一二五、結果比上日現貨英緊〇四六八七五、美軟〇六二五、期貨英縮〇六二五、美緊〇九三七五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>港滬匯兌獨升</p>
<p>香港二十二日（週六）、今晨滙市開盤平穩，除申滙現貨獨升一元、價爲叫百五十三元外、餘無變動、</p>
<p>天津英美續長</p>
<p>天津二十二日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤吿鬆、倫敦電滙不動、仍站六便士六五六二五、紐的電滙硬〇三一二五、爲六元〇三一二五、申滙降一元、爲八十九元五角、「聯鈔」暗盤微昂一角、爲七十元〇九</p>
<h3>金融界多故　金價激騰</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、因本市中國與蘇農兩行發生驚人事件、十點半左右倫敦電傳、平準會將停止供結本市外滙、致數日來各方虛浮之人心受恐怖而驟見向榮、外滙暗市步緊、致金價亦在非常買風中劇漲、價已飛出六千四百元大關外、在天元·仁承永·大豐·恒記買勢下、證券幫益大竟進萬兩以上、供求之勢懸殊、故在易漲難回之局勢下、價由晨開六千三百七十元、飛升至六千四百九十元、後金號與銀號復出、午牧小挫爲六千四百七十九元、仍軋升一百十九元、半日交易四五萬兩、下午週六無市、塲外價再飛升至六千五百二十五元、掉期（三月轉入四月）賣方須貼出予買方五十元、現金未聞做開價　期交高二百五十元至二百七十元、飾金升十元、達六百九十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>塲外已出五百元關</p>
<p>晨初每條（十兩）、開時因滙市報緊、多數喊照掛脾買進、遂即抬起十元、爲六千三百七十元、此後加之市上有某樓利多傳說、本月份美金五元四〇六二五難結、烚赤買風更熾、天元·益大·仁承永先來在吸、且不久大豐·恒記·祥和亦跟之力進、遂飛漲八十元、達六千四百五十元、後滙市稍定、同康永·德孚·祥興永突起賣意、曾回跌至六千四百二十元、卒因外滙復軟、大豐代套頭者猛撈、而同康永·德孚亦轉賣爲買、又升至六千四百七十五元、繼因順源·德成吐出、重稍回跌、斯時恒記忽傾向吐塞、會又回小至六千四百四十元、卒因人心向上、且聞倫敦電訊、平準基金委員會有放棄黑市外滙維持之說、一時空方順源·聯興等忍痛斬結、祥和亦買、迨午刻竟漲至六千四百九十元、惟收盤前成記·恒記拋賣、結果遂吿六千四百七十化元、比上日軋漲一百十九元、照四月美金五元三一二五結價爲六千五百五十五元、約撳七十六元、半天一百二十元上落、塲外市勢允挺、順源德成搜買、六千四百九十五元成交頗多、午後週六雖停市、但塲外有做六千五百二十五元、現金號之本牌金照期貨烚赤的高三百元、收進比售出低八十元、現標金等均無做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、十時三刻掛高十元、大同行改懸六百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低四十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣跟漲不少</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價猛漲、英美金鎊隨之上漲三元、英金票依然呆定、市價站平、美金票由十八元二角四分、而步高至四角半、比上日軋漲二角八分、香港票隨港滬滙兌漲起三分、日金票及朝鮮票繼續挺漲、前者已高達二元、後者升爲一元六角四分、</p>
<h3>糧食　米商猶在掀風作浪　米糧又有大批到滬</h3>
<p>塲外洋米黑巿、昨日復起回風、早日開手、大戶客囤因連朝貶短、又都把持不脫、實銷見如此情形、恐再激起大變、均謀先着、遂相乘廉搜求、一般浮戶即亦隨風轉機、扳佾異常、形勢當爲反疲還緊、日商仍有辦裝、貼價拾級而登、迄中市、若小絞已自三千五百元開抵三千九百元、二號西貢自三千三百元至三千六百元、僅一號西貢以去路獨遜、較難提足、開高貨三千三百元、次貨三千一百元、三千元、火絞及暹羅且未聞做開、至此因原根客囤頗多乘高出籠、黑市漲勢方殺、嗣後一路徘徊、直至收市未吿再起、且覺市勢已稍帶軟焉、計收盤白身小絞貼價爲三千八九百元、中關三千七百元、一號西貢高三千二三百元、次三千元、二號西貢三千五百五十元、三千五百元、米菉及碎尖貼三千元、二千八百元、東京砶尖貼三千五六百元、比前市上午價回升二元左右、較下午則提有門元之巨、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米忍有湧到、頓餒、抱急脫之志、但本鄉店胃依然滯澀、乃不得不甩價相邀、一時跌風殊厲、驟落四元光景、若崑山斛見高白粳開一百二十元、中關百十八元次百十六元、靑角斛見薄稻開百十二元、僅常幫特粳以到貨較少、未有若是之猛、見貶二三元、開百二十四五元、普通百二十二元、至原包悉未做開、四五元、糯菉九十七八元至九十五元、</p>
<p>洋米來源頗旺、怡和洋行日　輪、由香港裝來大批洋米及洋麵粉、預計昨日下午到埠、但至傍晚未見進口、據該行稱、今晨定可到滬、故所裝究有若干、須待該輪到滬後、始可知曉、容再續報、聞華倫洋行經理之法輪Albert　Sarraut號、由西貢直接運來大量洋米、的二萬四千餘包之鉅、的今日抵滬、再有格蘭輪亦由西貢裝來大批洋米、明日可到、　公司達得娘郵船、此次由西貢運來鉅量洋米、竟有七萬包之鉅、的二十五日抵埠、又昨有麵粉二千包運烟台、（祖）</p>
<h3>浮囤貶脫　粉價小回</h3>
<p>麵粉　現洋粉市况，初疲後穩、蓋自香港轉口粉逐到以來、存底日益充斥、本客實銷、趁此觀望不前、大戶手貨、多數上棧、待價而沽、散戶浮囤則已不支而貶脫、金龍牌坎粉降至二十九元、花鳥鐘樓牌澳粉價爲二十九元五·六角、其跌風殊爲猛烈、惟下午稍見帶穩、因米市回堅、本街實銷與客囤趁低收吸、故晚收回高一·二角、華廠平賣粉仍由福新廠供給五千八百七十三包、價二十五元、</p>
<p>小麥　昨小麥擯持如常、內地杜麥供源久枯、現貨搜羅殆盡、華廠方面、阜豐業已停車、僅福新廠供給平賣粉、仍在續定洋粉以資接濟、聞高杜麥價在四十五元左右、因粉市平落、局勢亦帶軟化、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債跌風小作</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况忽起意外之跌風、緣中國銀行行員無故被捕多人、故該行至十一時許仍照常開市、而人心因此而起向壁虛構之謠言、恍惚不寗之債市、遭此益覺抬頭不起、昨日週六祇做上午一盤交易、初開即小數角、當時聯和益記恒康賣出頗湧、雖　康信孚買進、而市價竟仍小三四角、後以順昌恒孚買進、價父抬高數角、仍因怡泰潤德賣出而再小、此種消息、其實殊無關宏旨、但人氣不免因此稍稍衰頹耳、午後停做、市價結果一律回小六角至九角、成交總數共計一百五十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股五百股、價爲八元一角牛、</p>
<p>倫敦二十一日（週五）電、中國中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、祗麥加利銀行股回好五先令、價爲八鎊十五先令、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　流言利多　棉紗漲風重起</h3>
<p>紗市山疲轉昂、且漲風復起、此因謠諑粉紜、謂皆屬利於買方、因之人心轉硬、但廠方爲推銷現貨走動起見、將雙馬現貨較廠單每包低廉一百元、於此一來、有一部份揑棧單之戶、紛紛了結、市勢向下、惟港帮採辦較爲活動、銷路暢達、及標金上漲、又復掀起投機買風、總之目前狀况、仍在迴旋之途中、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百〇四元、低價爲一千三百七十五元、午後　標金暗盤好、人心向堅、做一千四白十一二元、昨有棉紗一千二百二十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙　晨開、因上日午後大跌、雙馬晨開、因上日午後大跌、人氣續鬆、首盤價爲一千三百八十六元、少頃微落至一千三百七十五元、旋聞外匯開出趨縮　金上升、檯面十買風忽熾、且叫買聲甚高、直昂至一千四百〇四元、但有一部份盈利者吐出、又回挫至一千三百九十六元、繼以港帮銷塲不弱、及標金仍挺、情况良好、絡續而升至一千四百〇七元收盤、查半日間成交統計一萬六千包、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左香港　一、〇〇〇　南洋　五〇同行　一四、五〇〇　統計　一六·〇〇〇</p>
<h3>棉銷起色</h3>
<p>現棉情况尙昂、但廠方採辦未旺、不過同業中心思良好、所以互相買賣、殊形起色、查本週現棉較之前週漲五元至十元以上全週　成交三萬九千七百担、茲錄做開行情於左、</p>
<p>彭家坡二八三·五大德　二〇〇件棧交</p>
<p>白洛去二四一·〇均昌　二〇〇件又</p>
<p>又　二四二·〇又　一〇〇件又</p>
<p>又　二四二·〇沈元來　一〇〇件又</p>
<p>紐約棉市靜而堅、因有同業買進、及棉布貿易良好而漲、結果收盤價格、較之上日挺進五至十磅音不等、</p>
<p>印棉交易甚小、先因介方買進而漲、旋因獲利了結回跌、最後叉因空頭抵補冉漲、各牌漲一至四羅比半、預測今日開盤的漲一羅比半、</p>
<p>利物浦英棉期貨各跌六點、現貨無市、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、良以現紗向榮、各方購意轉濃、故市况仍屬熱鬧、而活躍也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布實銷進展</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨開平平、午後突轉堅昂、乃緣金價猛漲、同業及囤戶進胃大旺、兼以實銷亦有進展、故各布售盤、由平轉漲、白貨粗細布斜紋漲每疋二角半至五角、色布錢呢等漲每疋五角至七角半、本街成交各布現貨六百餘件、三四月份期貨三百餘件、染廠需要較强、浙路溫甬幫辦細布色布色斜二百餘件、閩粵幫辦藍布嗶嘰色斜粗細布三白餘件、昨有疋頭四百件運大津、二十件運烟台、一千〇六十五件運香港、</p>
<p>東京　晨市盤旋堅昂、白貨龍頭細布現棧單四十八元二角半、後市聞余價暗盤在升、人心益好、但以週六無市、未有成交、四君子嗶嘰午刻收盤售開一元叫角〇七五、</p>
<h3>糖巿　期粗車白步漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市因囤戶吸收期貨、粗車白漲勢較盛、公會划盤、現貨二四粗白外棧八十三元九角至八十叫元七角、升一元六角、三月底打單、初爲八十三元六角、旋升至八十四元八九角、升度相回、四月十日打單初爲八十三元八角至四元、後升至八十五元二三角、升一元六角半、太古車白BF嘜三月底打單八十五元、五允四角、五元五角、六元、升一元五六角、HX嘜三月底打單八十元八角、升九角、</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼條價昂銷减</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條市銷昨雖水見活躍、然亦未呈岑寂狀態、蓋本街建築帮及內河各地、均有　胃、兼之來源窘促、申市所存究屬有限、日後難免有斷擋之虞、以致執貨者、心思奇挺、標準扶搖直上、較前市暴漲二百元、昨如三四分貨及五分以上之粗花色、每噸均開二千七百元、因具開價之昂貴、實銷當不及昔日之通暢、此外本廠釘、會司鐵、馬口鐵、黑鐵坯等亦均因價昂而銷减、如本釘倍司一百五十五元、會司鐵三百六十元、馬口鐵四白元（一百八十磅）及四白五十元（二百磅）黑鐵坯子三千五百元等、</p>
<h3>煤炭　烟屑現貨充盈　不久可望回落</h3>
<p>烟煤屑各貨、自塊煤做高以後、亦步亦趨、高次貨均漲起二·三十元行情、蓋因市上缺貨、有意暗抬、日昨聞某洋行有基隆屑六千五百噸裝到、起卸上棧、卽將在市上發售、故現貨頓見充盈、不久可望回落云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　大片圓肉回跌</h3>
<p>大片牛晒圓肉、前以乏到、故號方所存少數之貨、盡力扳持、故桂元雖見疲跌、但此物反升三·四十元、茲後貨已有續到、且價格過昂、需要終屬零星、故號盤已暗　二·三十元、而受手仍少、</p>

<h3>怎樣紀念先烈？</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>小朋友毋，再隔五天，又是黃花崗先烈的紀念日了！（三月廿九日）我想小朋友毋，對於先烈殉國的故事，必定在書本上讀過，而耳熟能詳，這裏也毋庸贅述了，不過：怎樣來紀念先烈？你們小心靈中，是怎樣計劃？我在這裹，貢獻幾點　見吧。</p>
<p>第一，你們要搜集書　上或褂冊上所有殉國先烈的遺像，來一次描繪，或鉛畫，或墨筆畫，或水彩畫，都可以，將先烈如黃克强等，要畫得栩栩如生，奕奕有神。在每一幀的畫像下面，空白地方，塡寫着先烈們光榮歷史。</p>
<p>第　，在那天紀念之晨，將繪就的先烈遺像，懸掛起來，對他靜默追念五分鐘，舉手致敬。</p>
<p>第三，山較長的學童，召集一個小小紀念會，無論兄，弟，姊，妹，鄰兒，和同學，都可以喚來參加，誰能官講黃花崗烈士的故事，即推舉誰做主席，應將滿淸怎樣腐敗？烈士怎樣起義？怎樣衝進粵督署？怎樣前仆後繼，怎樣功敗垂成，烈十被殺，和爲什麼要革命？應講得詳詳細細。頭頭是道。</p>
<p>第四，大家合唱一支紀念歌：一黃花崗，黃花開，花開年復年，烈士英靈在。英靈不滅照天地，喚醒國魂合歡來。」</p>
<p>轟炸他國的軍事重地，所以忙得透不過氣來，這時的情景是再緊張也沒有了。而且在空中作戰，眞要眼明手快，乘虛而入，的確不是一種容易的事情，所以在招老飛行駕駛員的時候，非常嚴格，吾則非但徒然犧牲性命，而且一架飛機的價値也是很高貴的啊！當飛機在空中表演飛行術，往往在空中大翻觔斗，駕駛員不會跌出來，這因爲坐位上有皮帶紥住駕駛員身體的緣故，而且皮帶縛住身體，靈便異常，只手用一抽，搭鈕就可脫掉，皮帶能自動解開。駕駛員身穿的飛行衣上都沒有鈕扣，而用拉鍊，穿着十分便捷。如飛得高人雲霄，氣候往往冷到零度以下，這時衣服悉可以通電，使身體溫暖。假使飛機出了事，要是到了萬不得已的時候，駕駛員便身帶降落傘而自飛機中跳下來以逃生。這種降落傘有兩種形式，一種是背負式，就是負在背上的，另一種是坐在屁股底下的。當駕駛員跳出飛機時的一剎那，嘴裏一定唸完「一二三」三個字，才把手抽動降落傘的繩子，於是那傘便開始張開，如不唸完三字，而把繩子拉得過早，降落傘便往往會摘在飛機翼尾上，這樣便很危險了。這决歐戰俄國是最先利用傘兵作戰，那傘兵是飛機運載的，手拿了槍砲，背上負着降落傘降下地來作戰，這種戰術眞是適合我國所謂「飛將軍從天而降」的老話」。阿慧父親說到這裏，不說下去了，因爲他所要說的話都說完了啊！</p>
<h3>蝌蚪</h3>
<p>— 金賢法</p>
<p>明兒走到園子裏，他看見那草地已披了新綠，樹上也開滿了粉紅色的桃花；花壇裏的野花正在紅紅白白地相映成趣，更有，燕子們在天空裏高翔，蝴蝶們在花徑裹飛舞，他暗想：這就是春到人間了啊！春風和暖地吹來，春陽照在他的天眞的臉上，他也愉快地笑了。</p>
<p>走到池邊，忽然他看到那綠水裹有許多黑色的蝌蚪在游來游去，便蹲在池邊，鼓着小手想去捉它們，一面高喊着：「哥哥快拿網來吧！這裹有許多很好玩的小魚。」</p>
<p>琪兒正在屋子裏看書，聽見他弟弟的喊聲，就走出來問：「弟弟，喊我做什麼？這樣大驚小怪地。」</p>
<p>「哥哥，快拿綱來捉啊，它們要逃走了。」明兒還是這樣高喊着，他伏在地面上，右手已浸入水裹了。</p>
<p>「不要胡鬧，弟弟，快起來！」琪兒趕過去扶起他弟弟，一面又說：「這是蝌蚪，我們別去捉它。」</p>
<p>「蝌蚪是什麼呵？」</p>
<p>「蝌蚪就是靑蛙們的幼蟲，牠們在水裹生活了十幾天就要變成靑蛙了，靑蛙是對於農田很有益的蟲類，它最喜吃害蟲，使我們田裏的稻很快地長大起來。」</p>
<p>琪兒拉着他弟弟的手坐在柳樹下的一塊大石上，又繼續說下去：「要是你將蝌蚪捉來養在瓶裏，他們過一夜就死了，那末你等於殺死許多靑蛙，沒有了靑蛙，田裏的害蟲就多起來，他們將稻吃完了，農家就不能收穫什麼了。沒有了米，我們沒有飯吃，就要活活地餓死，昨天我們到學校裏去，在路上不是看見有許多窮人餓死嗎？這就是爲了米商們的手段毒辣，他們不肯將藏在棧房裏的米賤價賣給人家…………」</p>
<p>談到這裏，明兒頓時悔悟了，他說：「我不要再去捉蝌蚪了。」</p>
<p>「是呵，弟弟，再過半月我們就可聽見許多靑蛙們的聲音，像敲鼓似的在我家的池塘裹唱歌了。你喜歡聽嗎？」</p>
<p>「我很愛聽，」明兒拍手跳起來了，此時有一隻蝴蝶飛過他的前面，那美麗的如穿着綵衣的飛蟲又使他出神地望了好一會。</p>
<p>琪兒又吿訴他弟弟，要使那養在瓶裏的蝌蚪不會死，司以在瓶底鋪細沙，更放些水草，就行，只是瓶裹的蝌蚪要變成靑蛙，日子是相當地慢，變成了就死去，當然，蝌蚪們是愛自由的，瓶裏的滋養料那裏能像池子裏的豐富。</p>
<p>午睡的時候到了，他們就繞了幾條曲折的園徑，回到屋子裏去了，在園子裏又飄來一陣淸脆悅耳的鶯歌。</p>
<h3>康元玩具徵文兒童之部第二名　我所最喜愛的康元玩具</h3>
<p>— 章志潔</p>
<p>我所最喜愛的康元玩具，是發火小坦克車，灰色的外衣，重疊的橡皮輪，矮胖的身村轉動起來，永遠拖着莊重的步伐。</p>
<p>餓時，我越看越像這是爸爸的化身，爸的眼不正如坦克車的噴火管，常常射出英俊可愛的火花嗎？爸動作的穩健端莊，那是更活像一架緩緩而馳的坦克車了；我愛爸，因此我也傑深的愛起我的小坦克車來。</p>
<p>可是，每當我睜大了眸子，抱着爸的臉，稚氣的吿訴他我的想像時，爸總是微笑着搖搖頭說：一潔潔的話都對，從外形上看來，爸眞的很像一架坦克車，並且爸更希望潔潔將來長大了，做起事來也像坦克車一樣的勇敢，不怕障礙；可是，潔潔可知道？坦克車又像老虎一樣的會吃人呢！無數忠勇愛國的將士，犧牲在坦克車的發火管下了，更多的美麗的田園，被坦克車的巨輪，摧殘得粉碎，爸不願有坦克車一般的居心，爸更深深的痛恨坦克車的兇狠。</p>
<p>於是，我明亮的眸子開始陰暗了，呆呆地望着這在桌子上蠢動的怪物出神，突然間，我又恢復了活潑天眞，快樂地對爸說：「這不是我所喜愛的坦克，我所愛的坦克車車的巨輪，只踏平世間不平的路，它的威嚴的槍口，也永遠祇對着强暴的人們</p>
<h3>我希望康元廠再有何種新玩具</h3>
<p>有一天，我對爸爸說：「康元廠出品的玩具，種類繁多，都眞可愛，眞是我們兒童的恩物，不過，我希望康元廠以後再製造些不失玩具趣味，而又合於實用的玩具；像我們學校裏給小朋友騎的木馬，假使縮小了，製造玩具，那麼，只要發條一開，木馬就會眞的像有小朋友坐在上面一樣動盪起來，多麼好玩，並且，木馬的底，不是和爸爸的吸墨水器一樣嗎？只要包上一張吸墨水紙，就可給潔潔吸墨水了。」爸爸聽了，也點頭稱是。</p>
<h3>關於飛機的話</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>上星期日阿慧的父親講了不少關於飛機的話。正當他老人家講得起勁，而阿慧聽得全神貫注的當兒，忽被他母親打住了。於是在這星期日的上午，阿慧又要求他父親繼續講下去。</p>
<p>他父親對他說：「我上决講到那裏？我倒忘了你能吿訴我嗎？」父親是暗暗地試騐阿慧的記憶力强不强，而且更要測騐他對於上次所講的，是不是能完全「消化」而牢記在心頭？</p>
<p>「爸爸，上次講的是飛機怎樣上升的，飛機上的機關槍怎樣射擊的，炸彈是怎樣擲下的？最後講到飛機爲什麼排列成三角形或人字形？這些你已經講過了，對不對？」阿慧滔滔地背出這麼一大篇。</p>
<p>好！不錯。我冉講一些給你聽聽：飛機和飛機作戰不是很好看的嗎？可是駕駛員在這時的性命如千鈞一髮，因爲普通一架戰鬥機只有一二個駕駛員，在戰鬥時，旣要管理機械，又要開機關槍射擊別國的飛機，有時還要投炸彈</p>

<p>嘉寳對人說：她之所以長久不演戲，是為了史本賽屈塞的緣故。因為她堅執着她的影片的男主角非史本賽莫屬。但公司當局迄今缺乏適合二人個性的劇本。同時史本賽正以全副精力去演一部與「化身博士」相似的片子，女主角屬意於卡洛朗白與琴逑羅吉絲，但二人因排名問題，謙辭不就，聞已請在「寒夜琴挑」中的　格麗褒曼担任。</p>

<h3>U.S. House of Representatives Unanimously Passes a Huge National Defense Supplementary Appropriation; Continental Army Plan to be Swiftly Realized; Lend-Lease Appropriation Bill to be Debated in the Senate Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Washington - The House of Representatives yesterday unanimously passed a $4,073,000,000 fifth national defense supplementary appropriation bill and has sent the bill to the Senate for discussion. The House, after four hours of debate, passed the bill by a vote of 320 to 0. The most important point raised during the debate was New York Republican Representative Fish's warning. Fish stated that if the current program of excessive spending in the United States continues, the entire American economic and financial system will collapse and be replaced by a new order of national socialism. Fish predicted that by the end of June, total U.S. expenditures under the Lend-Lease Act would exceed $40,000,000,000. He also predicted that another tax bill would be passed in the coming months to raise a huge sum of between $20,000,000,000 and $30,000,000,000 to increase revenue. American businesses, large and small, will be paralyzed by the burden of this tax. This bill was immediately sent to the House for discussion after being passed by the House Appropriations Committee. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - The House Appropriations Committee yesterday approved the $40,000,000,000 fifth supplementary national defense appropriation bill. The House will soon begin debating the bill. The testimony of Army Chief of Staff General Marshall before the committee in a closed session on March 5 was released yesterday. He said that the United States received detailed reference materials regarding German mechanized divisions at the end of February. The U.S. Army is preparing to establish eight such mechanized divisions. The War Department currently has two divisions, and the War Department plans to allocate $1,880,000,000 to establish new Atlantic air force bases. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - The military output from factories stipulated in the U.S. budget is sufficient to supply the needs of four million soldiers. The proposal to continue adding funding to the Army and Navy, exceeding $4,073,000,000, has now been sent to the House. At the same time, the Senate Appropriations Committee passed the original text of the $7,000,000,000 aid-to-Britain bill without any modifications. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>U.S. Has Drafted Production Plan; Will Supply Britain with 20,000 Aircraft in the Next 18 Months</h3>
<p>New York - According to a dispatch from Washington, senior U.S. government officials have drafted a production plan to supply Britain with 20,000 military aircraft in the next 18 months, including the 10,700 aircraft stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act (approximately half of which are medium and heavy bombers) and the 9,000 aircraft ordered by Britain before the passage of this bill. Responsible parties have announced that they are currently "investigating air routes to Britain" to allow night-flying fighter planes to fly in segments. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Stipulating $10,000,000,000 for Constructing a Powerful Air Force</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. plan to build a powerful air force and an army of four million men has taken a step closer to realization with the unanimous passage of the fifth national defense supplementary appropriation bill by the House of Representatives yesterday. The passage of this huge appropriation bill is of great importance to the Army Department's plans, as the largest amount listed in the bill, totaling $10,000,000,000, is for the immediate construction of 3,600 Army bombers (including 1,200 four-engine heavy bombers). A portion of this amount is also for equipping the primary and secondary equipment used by four million soldiers. Some individuals have criticized the use of such a large sum of money for national defense. Virginia Democratic Representative Woodrum said that the total cost of U.S. defense now exceeds $25,000,000,000, not including the $7,000,000,000 Lend-Lease appropriation passed by the House. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - The Senate is scheduled to begin debating the $7,000,000,000 Lend-Lease appropriation bill on the 24th. According to leaders of the Democratic Party in the Senate, the opposition has completely collapsed, and the bill will be passed quickly. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>to reach British shores. As for our fleet visiting Australia, it is also a symbol of our concern for the current situation. The Hartford Courant reported that we are already practically participating in the war. Our country is the arsenal of the democratic countries, and its important position in the war is no less than that of soldiers fighting on the battlefield. The Dallas Morning News reported that if anyone still has doubts about our country's assistance to democratic countries in the war, they should read President Roosevelt's speech and be reassured.

<h3>U.S. May Reassign High Commissioner to the Philippines</h3>
<p>Washington - Secretary of the Interior Ickes is currently accompanying President Roosevelt on a ten-day fishing trip. It is heard that he is definitely discussing the position of the High Commissioner to the Philippines with the President. There is nothing to indicate that the current High Commissioner Sayre will be recalled home. Reliable sources say that the authorities intend to appoint Sayre as an advisor on post-war international transportation affairs. There are many contenders for the vacated position, the most important being former Minister to Canada Cromwell, followed by former Commander of the Asiatic Fleet Yarnell, and then former Ambassador to Britain Kennedy.

<p>Moscow - Admiral Isakov, Deputy People's Commissar for the Navy of the Soviet Union, has been appointed concurrently as Chief of Staff of the Navy.

<p>U.S. to Ship Military Supplies to Britain; May Dispatch Warships as Escort</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. Navy officials expressed in private conversations here last night that the United States will soon escort its military supplies across the Atlantic to Britain. Reuters heard from a certain source that this may be seen in a few days. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - Senior shipping officials said yesterday that fifty U.S. merchant ships could be transferred to Britain within days, 75% of which are old ships from the First World War that have been re-equipped and are past their prime. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>New York - A New York Times correspondent in Washington reported that the issue of convoys is currently under discussion. Some outspoken officials have long seen the need for convoys to ensure that U.S. promises do not become empty talk. They have since made their views more noticeable. However, as escorting with U.S. fleets would increase the possibility of a German declaration of war, President Roosevelt and his experts and advisors must carefully consider this step. The news that the U.S. will transfer fifty merchant ships to the U.S. side was widely praised by various radio critics last night. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - It is heard that the U.S. government has collected 150 small warships in various ports, preparing to hand them over to the British Navy for escorting merchant ships. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>New York - President Roosevelt's recent speech on aiding the various democratic countries is still being enthusiastically praised by newspapers across the country. The New York Times reported that the victory of the democratic countries is linked to the fortune of the U.S., a fact that no one can now ignore. Although the President's speech only expressed his personal views, in reality, he has expressed the views of the entire American nation. The attitude of the American nation has now been fully revealed. In short, our policy of aiding the various democratic countries is backed by 130 million people and unlimited natural resources. Our country's massive industry is only in the early stages of wartime production. With our earnest desire, we believe that the various supplies we ship across the ocean will surely be like</p>
<h3>Exchange Stabilization Fund Issue; China and Britain in Negotiations; To Avoid Use to Support Shanghai Black Market; Some British Parties Propose Payment Agreement</h3>
<p>London - It is believed here that the recent weakness of Chinese legal tender is due to the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund not supporting the black market, not because the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund is unable to do so, but because it is unwilling to do so. The Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund certainly has a large amount of cash as a result of the U.S. loan. Negotiations are currently underway between China and Britain to ensure that British gold assistance to the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund is not used to support the Shanghai black market. The above-mentioned black market is a major loophole in British gold exchange controls. Some parties propose the establishment of a China-Britain payment agreement, using special accounting. However, given the international complexity of the Shanghai foreign exchange market, greater flexibility is given to Chinese holders of British gold than elsewhere. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Invasion of China Has Greatly Damaged Its Vitality</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - The Swedish Gothenburg Daily newspaper stated in its editorial today that while there is no reason to underestimate Japan's war machine, the prolonged and inconclusive war in China has greatly damaged Japan's vitality. Japan's grand plans of conquest have not been realized. If Japan engages in war with a powerful country in the Pacific, it will put Japan in a worse situation than Italy. Matsuoka's propaganda and intense anti-American agitation are clearly linked. Berlin has openly hoped that the U.S. will participate in the war in a more definite way. The reason for this hope is not to have one more enemy, but because the U.S.'s assistance as a non-belligerent is a greater threat to Germany than if the U.S. were to participate in the war. If Berlin can induce Japan to believe that the U.S. is attacking Germany, then the Three-Power Pact will be put into effect. This means that Japan, Slovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria must provide military assistance to the Axis powers. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Craigie Meets with Senior Official; Discusses Outstanding British-Japanese Issues</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Yugoslavia Joins the Axis</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this month, after Bulgaria joined the Axis and German troops poured into Bulgarian territory, the world knew that before formally attacking Greece, Hitler would first pressure Yugoslavia to allow German troops to pass through, following in the footsteps of Bulgaria. The goal of the psychological warfare that Germany has been waging against the Belgrade government for the past three weeks is none other than this. According to a news report yesterday, after a long period of debate, the Yugoslav cabinet has decided to sign an agreement with Germany, Italy, and Japan; to join the alliance, but to refuse to accept any military obligations, only allowing German ambulances and armaments to pass through, but not troops. If this approach can win Hitler's approval, then although it is a surrender, it can also be seen as a small achievement for the efforts of Yugoslav officials and people in recent months to maintain independence and integrity and prepare to shed blood to defend themselves; because the degree of their surrender is indeed better than that of Romania and Bulgaria. In addition, the anger and excitement of some of the people and the departure of three cabinet members when the Yugoslav cabinet made its decision are at least enough to show that the hearts of the Yugoslavs are not dead; if Hitler still wants to make further demands, it is difficult to guarantee that other issues will not arise.</p>
<p>Originally, since Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria successively surrendered, Yugoslavia had become a fish on the chopping block that Hitler was eager to seize; and the invisible disintegration of the Balkan Entente had left her completely isolated. In terms of military strategy, she was almost surrounded by the Axis powers on all sides, although she had hundreds of thousands of troops that were still capable of fighting, but due to the complexity of her ethnic groups, domestic opinions were not necessarily completely consistent. In terms of diplomacy, Britain had the heart to protect her, but was powerless to do so; the Soviet Union was certainly very concerned, but had absolutely no ability to help. Under these circumstances, it was simply expected that Yugoslavia would eventually succumb. From now on, assuming that there are no major changes in Yugoslavia's turbulent regime, and no major fluctuations occur abroad that are sufficient to change the current situation in the Balkans, then the fate of this "eighth allied country" will inevitably become a vassal of Germany; even if it is not militarily occupied by German troops, it will at least be completely controlled by the Nazis economically and politically. This tragic fate of disguised destruction has already been repeated, and is commonplace, and the world is deeply sympathetic to it, but what we want to pay more attention to is the future developments after Yugoslavia joins the alliance.</p>
<p>Assuming that Hitler really uses the military convenience he has obtained in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to move his troops south to capture Thessaloniki, and then expand the war towards the southern end of the Balkans and even the Near East, then the subsequent issues seem to be divided into two aspects: first, we must ask whether Greece will remain true to its original intention, not afraid of Germany's powerful military threat, and determined to continue the war? Regarding this level, we believe that there is no doubt, especially today, when British troops have already landed in Greece and U.S. aid has already been implemented, Greece has no reason to give up halfway and fail to achieve success. Moreover, Hitler has truly prepared to create a new battlefield in the southern end of the Balkans to consume the troops he plans to use for an attack on Britain, and it has not yet been completely determined. Second, we must see how Turkey and the Soviet Union react? According to a Havas dispatch the other day, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoglu flew to the British island of Cyprus recently to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden. Before the meeting, Saracoglu had repeatedly exchanged views with the Soviet government and obtained some "guarantees" from the Soviet Union; it can be seen that this meeting between the British and Turkish foreign ministers is not only related to the decision of Turkey's attitude, but also enough to reveal the true intentions of Moscow. Unfortunately, as of now, Britain, Turkey, and the Soviet Union have completely kept silent about this level. One view is that the Soviet Union advised Yugoslavia to join the Three-Power Alliance, but opposed allowing German troops to pass through, and another view is that the Soviet Union will sign an agreement similar to the Three-Power Alliance with Yugoslavia to "guarantee" Yugoslavia's territorial integrity; according to the former view, the Soviet Union has almost recognized that Germany's pressure on Yugoslavia is irresistible in fact, so it has to advise the Yugoslav authorities to make limited concessions; according to the latter view, the Soviet Union clearly wants to use the same method to offset Germany's pressure on Yugoslavia, so that Yugoslavia becomes a "non-aggression buffer zone." Regardless of which view is correct, at least we can find a clue from this; that is, the Soviet Union is not prepared to take active intervention actions in the Balkans for the time being, but still hopes to avoid the expansion of the war in this area as much as possible. Therefore, if Hitler "remains inactive," and only uses military superiority to force Greece to negotiate peace alone, then the current attitude of the Soviet Union and even Turkey may continue for some time. Conversely, if German troops immediately expand the war, even affecting the safety of Turkey's straits, then there will inevitably be other surprising developments in the Balkans in the future; how these divergent paths of movement will eventually converge will be seen in the unfolding of the Nazi's so-called spring offensive.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Jiangxi Begins Counter-Offensive Against Japanese Army; Japanese Casualties Over Past Five Days Number Three Thousand; Chinese Army in Suiyuan Repeatedly Captures Important Strongholds</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A Ta Kung Pao reporter in Changsha reported today that the Chinese army has begun a counter-offensive against the Japanese army in Jiangxi. In the past five days, Japanese casualties numbered 2,000 to 3,000, and the trend has shifted in favor of the Chinese army. The newspaper prominently reported the Japanese army's offensive in Tingxi today. This time, the Japanese army advanced westward along the Nanchang-Changsha highway. The main column of the Japanese army supported other troops. The right wing of the Japanese army has reached Shangfu, 50 miles west of Nanchang, and near Shanggao, 77 miles west of Nanchang, but Shanggao was still in the hands of the Chinese army yesterday. There is still fierce fighting in northwestern Jiangxi Province. Chinese military sources reported that the Chinese army that recovered Gaochuan withdrew from the area on March 18 and retreated to positions not threatened by the Japanese army. After recovering Gaochuan, the Chinese army continued to advance westward, threatening Wuhu, but the Japanese army launched a fierce counter-offensive. As a result, the Chinese army withdrew from Gaochuan after destroying various fortifications. A Chinese military spokesman denied that the Japanese army had surrounded the Chinese army west of Taihu, because the Japanese army's own transportation lines could not be maintained and were often harassed by guerrillas. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Lihuang - The Japanese army, which was repulsed by the Chinese army at Wushanpo, reinforced with more than 2,000 troops and more than 10 artillery pieces from Shaniatangshan on the 15th and launched a counter-attack against the Chinese army. The Chinese army fought bravely and intercepted them, killing many Japanese soldiers. (Dispatch, 21st)</p>

<h3>National Government Decides to Continue Construction of Yunnan-Burma Railway; Issues U.S. Dollar Bonds to Fund Construction; U.S. Agrees to Allow Bonds to Circulate in U.S. Market</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Newspapers here recently reported that the Chinese government has decided to circulate bonds worth U.S. $100,000,000 in the U.S. market to fund the construction of the Kunming-Lashio railway, and stated that the U.S. government has agreed to this plan. The plan to circulate Chinese bonds in the U.S. market was proposed by Dr. Cooley, an administrative assistant to President Roosevelt, who recently returned from a visit to China. If this plan is successful, the Kunming-Lashio railway will become a joint undertaking of China, Britain, and the U.S. Newspapers also stated that the government has ordered Kwong Bing-shun, a representative of overseas Chinese in San Francisco, to handle the circulation of bonds in the U.S. Kwong left for Hong Kong last night and will transfer to the U.S. The Chinese bonds here will be circulated in the U.S. market, and the funds raised will be used to purchase U.S. railway materials for the construction of the Kunming-Lashio railway. The section of the railway in British territory from Lashio to the border will also be built with the above-mentioned U.S. materials, as it is currently difficult to transport British materials to China. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Chinese government has decided to issue U.S. dollar bonds worth U.S. $80,000,000 to build the Yunnan-Burma railway. It has now obtained special permission from the U.S. government to issue them in the U.S. Once the legislative procedures here are completed, they can be issued. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The National Government has firmly decided to continue the construction of the Yunnan-Burma railway. It is also heard that the required funds will be raised by issuing gold bonds. Because there is a special agreement with the U.S. government, it is rumored that Washington has agreed to allow China to raise U.S. $10,000,000 in the U.S. This road was originally started by the Chinese government, but was later suspended due to circumstances. When the Burmese delegation came to Chongqing two months ago, the Chinese and Burmese representatives discussed this issue. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Businesses Adopt Shanghai Time in Beiping</h3>
<p>Beiping - It was recently announced that nine British businesses and the Foreign Banks Association will adopt Shanghai time starting Monday. However, the official time of the embassy district in Dongjiaominxiang will not change. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Wartime Public Bond Solicitation Committee Stipulates Bond Solicitation Methods</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Wartime Public Bond Solicitation Committee has received instructions from Chairman Chiang on bond solicitation methods, using both solicitation and allocation. In cities, fair allocation is the principle, and in rural areas, solicitation and subscription are the principle. Therefore, a deliberation committee will be established in Chongqing, inviting relevant authorities and locals familiar with the local situation to serve as committee members, so as to implement fair allocation. The establishment of this committee is due to the suggestion of Kwong Bing-shun, a wealthy overseas Chinese businessman from the Americas. The overseas Chinese in the Americas have an assessment committee that assesses the wealth and income of overseas Chinese donors each time to determine the amount of their contributions. Kwong will fly to Hong Kong today to return to the U.S. to serve as the resident commissioner of the solicitation committee in the U.S. The government has also designated Kwong Bing-shun to preside over the solicitation work.

<h3>Soviet Union and Japan Purchase Large Quantities of Philippine Coconut Oil</h3>
<p>Manila - Authoritative sources say that the quantity of coconut oil and copra shipped from the Philippines to Vladivostok, Shanghai, and Kobe has recently increased significantly. Many believe that these items must be transshipped to Germany. Authoritative sources point out that most of these items are shipped to the Soviet Union, which is clearly shipped to Germany, because the Soviet Union did not need such a quantity of goods before the war and has no coconut oil refining equipment. In February, a total of 15,000 tons of copra were shipped out of Manila, and the quantity of coconut oil and copra that should be shipped out this month is likely to be the same. The first Soviet ship to Manila loaded 5,800 tons of copra and left after a week. The shipping industry expects that five Soviet ships will come here within three months. Negotiations on purchasing more copra and coconut oil have begun in Moscow. Chinese exporters here are planning or have already shipped 30,000 tons of these items to Shanghai, which will be shipped to Shanghai and transshipped to the Soviet Union in the next three months. These exporters also say that Shanghai exporters used to purchase copra from the Dutch East Indies, but the Dutch there have refused to export it because they believe that these items will be transshipped to Germany. Therefore, Manila has become the only market for purchasing this item, even if the price is 40% higher than in the Dutch East Indies, trade is still booming. Japan's purchase of this item has increased significantly, with Mitsui &amp; Co. purchasing the most. It is heard that what the Japanese purchase is also transshipped elsewhere. The price increase of these items is due to the large purchases in Kobe and Shanghai. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>US Military Experts Predict: Balkan War Will Erupt; British Success or Failure Hinges on Maintaining Control of the Near East; Germany Will Not Dare Invade Britain Until Victorious in the Balkans</h3>
<p>Washington – American military experts recently have been focusing their attention on the Balkan front, believing that the eruption of a Balkan war is almost certain to be decisive, similar to the situation in 1918. These prophetic experts say that if Hitler can break through the combined British and Greek defenses on the Bulgarian front, the Germans' prospects will be greater than any gains they have made anywhere since the war began. At that time, the Germans' opportunity will be even better than when France surrendered and Britain was heavily bombed last September. Britain's international prestige and military fate largely depend on whether Britain can maintain the Suez Canal, as the Suez Canal is the most important condition for defending the British Empire, more important than Gibraltar or any other location. Military experts also explained that Britain's ability to maintain supply lines connecting South Africa and Australia depends entirely on its ability to control the Red Sea. If Britain is forced to abandon the Red Sea, it will lose its connection to the rich grain-producing areas of the Nile region, the oil fields of the Near East, and if the Allies can further control French Africa, the route around the Cape of Good Hope will also be in danger. In short, many things will depend on whether Britain can permanently control the Suez Canal and the eastern Mediterranean. If this gateway can remain open, Hitler may not dare to launch an attack on Gibraltar, because the western end of the Mediterranean is far less important than the eastern end. This is why Britain is greatly reinforcing Greece; otherwise, Britain could have used this large army to annihilate the Italians in Libya at this time. Germany's large army in the same region, even at the expense of Italy's prestige (Italy must rely on German aid to attack Greece, and its prestige will naturally be damaged), is also for this reason. Military experts also believe that Germany will probably not attempt any invasion of Britain until the Balkan war reaches a decisive stage. (United Press report, 22nd)</p>
<h3>German Navy Launches Blitzkrieg Against Britain; 20,000-Ton Ships Appear in the Atlantic; Germany Claims British Ships Suffered Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>London – A Reuters naval reporter said that according to London officials, the German 26,000-ton battlecruisers "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" have recently escaped into the Atlantic. British Prime Minister Churchill, in his speech on Monday, disclosed that two German battlecruisers engaged in attacks were operating westward in the Atlantic, reaching as far as the 42nd meridian, a location two-thirds of the way from Britain to North America. According to information received a few days ago, it has been confirmed that these two ships are the "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau." Germany's risking these two ships to engage in Atlantic warfare shows that Hitler's navy is now fully mobilized, launching a "shipping lane blitzkrieg" in the Atlantic, hoping to cut off American supplies to Britain. These two ships began construction in 1934 and were completed in 1939 and 1938, respectively, with a speed of 27 knots. However, the speed during sea trials was considered higher than this, so it is believed that their actual speed exceeds 29 knots. If fuel is conserved, they can stay at sea for about three weeks without refueling. The two ships are sister ships, and their main armament is nine 11-inch guns. The "Scharnhorst" was hit by the British battleship "Glorious" off the coast of Norway last April, and was later hit by a torpedo fired by the British submarine "Clyde," suffering heavy damage. It was also bombed by the British Air Force in Kiel. (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – This afternoon, the German military communique stated that Admiral Lütjens, commander of the German medium-sized fleet operating in the Atlantic, reported that his fleet had sunk 22 enemy merchant ships (116,000 tons). A group of enemy ships, fully loaded with goods from West Africa, was sailing to England. Although British ships escorted them along the way, German submarines repeatedly attacked them for several days. After several attacks, a total of 11 enemy ships were sunk (77,000 tons). Yesterday, German aircraft also posed a significant threat to enemy ships, destroying 31,000 tons of enemy ships and sinking 6,000 tons of enemy ships. North of Crete, a new oil tanker (12,000 tons) was hit and caught fire. Two other ships were also hit, one ruptured and one caught fire. Near Malta, a British destroyer was hit. In the Bristol Channel, a merchant ship (4,000 tons) and a mobile oil tanker (4,000 tons) were sunk. Another merchant ship was sunk in Aldeburgh. (Haitong Electric report, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – As the German spring offensive moves forward, the German side claimed last night that the British ships destroyed in the past 24 hours amounted to at least 95,000 tons or 101,000 tons. The German High Command stated that Nazi submarines and dive bombers attacked two large British convoys, one in the Atlantic off the coast of West Africa and the other in the Mediterranean near Crete. It is claimed that as a result of the attacks, at least 87,000 tons of ships fully loaded with goods and even larger British fleets were attacked and sunk. It is said that all ships sunk by torpedoes were fully loaded with valuable goods heading to England. (International News Agency report, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – The Atlantic submarine base in Lorient, on the west coast of France, was attacked by British aircraft for the third consecutive night last night.

<h3>US Air Force’s Powerful Weapon: 82-Ton Heavy Bomber to Test Atlantic Crossing</h3>
<p>New York – The world's largest and most powerful bomber will soon make a test flight across the Atlantic. This aircraft is the 82-ton Douglas B-19, capable of flying across the Atlantic, dropping 18 tons of high-explosive bombs, and then flying back to its base. Mr. Altick described the details of this flight weapon in New York, saying that it is not only the largest military aircraft ever built, but also equipped with large-caliber machine guns and electrically powered, rapid-firing cannons, in addition to carrying bombs. This aircraft can exert its power above the range of anti-aircraft shells. The aircraft can accommodate a crew of ten, but if used to transport troops, it can carry 125 armed soldiers. The landing gear of this aircraft weighs five tons. (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Political Turmoil in Yugoslavia; German-Yugoslav Negotiations Stall; Three Yugoslav Cabinet Members Strive Against Signing Submissive Agreement with Germany by Threatening to Resign</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia – According to local political observers, a serious change may occur in the Yugoslav political situation at any time. Regent Prince Paul recently met with Serbian Orthodox elders to discuss countermeasures, but the details are unknown. (Havas Agency report, 21st)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia – A new political crisis has erupted in Yugoslavia. The so-called compromise conditions of the German side have caused a split in the Yugoslav cabinet. This was discovered after the cabinet met twice in 24 hours. Regent Prince Paul met with Prime Minister Cvetković and Deputy Prime Minister Maček on Friday afternoon to consider the next steps. Two cabinet members have already resigned, and another is preparing to resign, all in opposition to accepting the German proposal. It is reported that the latest proposal from the German side is to compromise between the demands of the Axis powers and those of Yugoslavia, superficially stipulating that foreign troops will not be stationed in Yugoslavia, but in practice granting Germany extensive transportation rights, such as the passage of military supplies through Yugoslavia. The German proposal also includes a clause prohibiting all anti-Axis movements. In return, the signatory countries of the Axis powers can guarantee the integrity of Yugoslavia. Nine cabinet members advocate accepting it, including Croatian Peasant Party leader Maček, Foreign Minister Marković, and three Croatian and three Serbian party members, as well as one Slovene party member. The Prime Minister and the leaders of the other three parties, including the Muslim leader, are hesitant. The cabinet members who have already resigned are Minister of Agriculture Mihailović, Minister of Justice Trnski and Minister of Social Welfare Budisavljević. Minister of Supplies Protić is also preparing to resign if the German conditions are accepted. Since the Yugoslav cabinet is showing signs of breaking down after much debate, the issue has been transferred to the Regent for handling. Prime Minister Cvetković and Deputy Prime Minister Maček have had lengthy discussions with Prince Paul in the palace. It is reported that during the talks, Prince Paul summoned the leader of the Slovenian People's Party, Krek, to the palace for consultation. According to the latest news, the Minister of the Army did not participate in the cabinet meeting. Those opposition party leaders who did not participate in the cabinet meeting unanimously opposed accepting the German conditions, believing that accepting such conditions would be tantamount to surrendering to Germany. (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Rumor of Continued German Pressure on Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that according to responsible sources here, although the news coming from Yugoslavia is still confused and unclear, it is certain that Germany is continuing to pressure Yugoslavia to conclude an agreement with it so that it can join the Axis powers. Today, a New York American news agency reported that former Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović, known for being pro-German, has been detained by the British. The news agency believes that the Yugoslav authorities handed Mr. Stojadinović over to the British to prevent any pro-German conspiracies from occurring in the Yugoslav capital during the crucial negotiations. According to news from the Yugoslav capital, negotiations with Germany have been temporarily suspended due to the tense situation in the capital. Currently, the Yugoslav government has not commented on rumors that Germany has put forward a compromise counter-proposal, but most news from the Yugoslav capital indicates that Yugoslavia will prevent foreign troops from entering Yugoslav territory, even if they are only passing through. Regarding the cabinet turmoil, no detailed news has been transmitted from the Yugoslav capital. The government's silence has undoubtedly caused considerable psychological confusion among the Yugoslav people. Yugoslavia's unwillingness to follow in the footsteps of Romania and Bulgaria has been clearly expressed. The disagreement within the cabinet reflects the strong sentiment against signing any agreement with Germany and Italy. If the Yugoslav people discover that their government advocates joining the Axis powers, it will undoubtedly arouse public anger. According to news here, the British ambassador to Yugoslavia has met with Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul in recent days. (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Diplomacy Secretly Active</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia – It has been learned that once Yugoslavia signs the Tripartite Pact, the Soviet Union will also sign a similar agreement with it to guarantee Yugoslavia's territorial integrity. In recent days, Soviet diplomacy towards Yugoslavia has been extremely active. Soviet Ambassador to Bulgaria Lavrentiev also came here yesterday and held lengthy talks with Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković. It is reported that the ambassador advised Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact in the name of the Soviet government, but stated that the Soviet Union would not be pleased if German troops passed through Yugoslavia. Furthermore, according to a telegram from this newspaper's Berlin correspondent, Soviet Ambassador to Germany Dekanozov has visited German diplomatic authorities several times recently, and it is believed that their discussions must be about the German-Yugoslav issue.

<h3>Turkey Increases National Defense Expenditures</h3>
<p>Ankara – The Turkish Parliament has voted to pass a supplementary budget of £30 million Turkish pounds for national defense. The total amount of national defense expenditure for this year has now reached £174,000,000 Turkish pounds, an increase of £100 million Turkish pounds compared to the original budget. (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital – According to Turkish political figures, British Foreign Secretary Eden's meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu on Cyprus Island focused on the letters exchanged between Hitler and İsmet İnönü. The newspapers yesterday published a message from the German news agency, announcing that the Turkish ambassador to Germany had delivered İsmet İnönü's reply to Hitler, but the content was not disclosed. According to sources close to the Turkish government, İsmet İnönü's reply was worded with extreme sincerity, reiterating Turkey's desire to maintain friendly relations with Germany.

<h3>Pro-German and Pro-British Factions in Opposition</h3>
<p>London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the news circulated by the pro-German faction in Yugoslavia that Germany and Yugoslavia have reached a compromise based on a compromise solution, allowing Germany the right to transport weapons and hospital vehicles through Yugoslavia without restrictions, is, judging from the political phenomena in the Yugoslav capital, at least not yet mature. Observing the trend of the Yugoslav cabinet, the firm attitude of the opposition, and the intense expression of public opinion, Yugoslavia is unlikely to make this important concession. The content of the German proposal is still unknown. According to reliable news from the Yugoslav capital regarding the political situation after the Yugoslav cabinet discussed the German proposal, it can be summarized as follows: the Yugoslav Prime Minister has a neutral attitude towards the German proposal; of the six party leaders who form the government, one supports the German proposal, two oppose it, and three are neutral; the heads of several departments did not participate in the cabinet meeting; the entire opposition party opposes the German conditions. (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>
<p>Istanbul – Yesterday, well-informed diplomatic circles said that, in any case, the talks between the British and Turkish Foreign Ministers on Cyprus Island were very successful with regard to the recent developments in Yugoslavia. Currently, a dispute over foreign policy is taking place in Yugoslavia, with one faction inclining towards the Axis powers and wanting Yugoslavia to join the Tripartite Pact, and the other faction opposing the Axis powers and inclining towards Britain, Greece, and Turkey, wanting to include Yugoslavia in the anti-Axis defense line of the Balkans. (United Press report, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Content of the Agreement Includes Six Items</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia – The cabinet meeting today has decided to sign a resolution with Germany, Italy, and Japan to join the Tripartite Pact. Local political figures recently said that the signing ceremony will be held in Berlin next week, with the intention of waiting for Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke to arrive in Berlin. As for the content of the resolution, it is nothing more than the following clauses:</p>
<p>(1) The signatory countries will guarantee the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. Bulgaria and Hungary will also provide this guarantee as signatory countries. Therefore, Bulgaria and Hungary will abandon their territorial claims against Yugoslavia. (2) The obligations of Yugoslavia are slightly different from those of other signatory countries. Yugoslavia is exempt from all military obligations, such as mutual military assistance and joint participation in military operations.</p>
<p>(3) The signatory countries will allow Yugoslavia's desire to obtain an outlet to the Aegean Sea once the current European war ends and the new European organization is in place to be considered. Currently, Yugoslavia uses the free port of Thessaloniki in Greece. (4) Yugoslavia will allow the weapons and ambulances of other signatory countries to pass through its territory without any inspection and will not prevent the passage of these vehicles. (5) Yugoslavia should suppress all anti-Axis elements within the country. (6) Yugoslavia should make its economic system, allowing its agricultural production, suitable for the needs of Germany. (Havas Electric report, 21st) The Soviet Union's first train also departed. (Haitong News Agency report, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Iraq Declares Policy; Willing to Abide by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty; But Avoids Participating in the War</h3>
<p>Baghdad – Iraqi Foreign Minister Suweidi recently made a statement regarding his recent meeting with British Foreign Secretary Eden in Cairo, saying, "We had frank talks in a friendly spirit, which reassured both sides, and a review of the current situation in the Middle East confirmed the need for cooperation between the two Allied countries within the limits of the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. I naturally had the opportunity to meet with Eden and exchange views on relations between the two Allied countries, Britain and Iraq. I also contacted other British officials responsible for the Middle East. I can now happily state that these talks have greatly reassured both sides. What Iraq is concerned about is, on the one hand, avoiding the tragedy of war, and on the other hand, fully fulfilling our obligations to the Allied countries." (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>
<h3>German Leader Meets Hungarian Foreign Minister in Munich; Enhancing Cooperation is the Focus of the Talks</h3>
<p>Berlin – According to the official gazette, German leader Hitler met with Hungarian Foreign Minister Bárdossy in Munich yesterday, and held talks for over an hour in a spirit of traditional friendship. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present. (Haitong News Agency report, 22nd)</p>
<p>Munich – The Hungarian Foreign Minister returned to his country from Munich by special train this morning. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other dignitaries saw him off at the station. (Haitong Electric report, 22nd)</p>
<p>Munich – The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop gave a welcome speech at the banquet for the Hungarian Foreign Minister, saying, "Since 1918, our two countries have been sincere and trustworthy, with a relationship like brothers. Now, the world's three major powers, namely Germany, Italy, and Japan, have concluded an alliance, and your country took the lead in joining, for which we are deeply grateful. Now, the task undertaken by the Tripartite Alliance has reached its final stage. In other words, the last enemy of the three countries, Britain, is about to fail. The current European war was triggered by Britain's declaration of war on our country on September 3, 1939. How its fate will be decided in 1940 is clear and in our favor. Today, as we engage in the final struggle, we are once again delighted to see our former ally Hungary cooperating with us." The Hungarian Foreign Minister, Bárdossy, immediately replied, emphasizing the close relationship between Germany and Hungary, "I will continue to work hard, following the wishes of the late Foreign Minister Csáky. This is my sacred duty. Our country's foreign policy is based on the Tripartite Alliance, and past trials have all been successful, and we will continue to do so in the future."

<h3>Fighting for the Capture of Corene Fortress; British and Italian Armies Battle in Bloody Conflict; Italy's Last Stronghold in Eastern Libya; Gala-el-Hbeib, the Holy Land, Falls Yesterday</h3>
<p>London – The recent communiqué from the British Air Force in the Middle East regarding the heavy bombing of Corene is only part of the relentless offensive by the British army against the strong Italian military stronghold there. According to battle reports, the bloody battle near Corene has lasted for two and a half days and has not stopped. The Italian army has repeatedly launched counterattacks against the positions captured by the British army at the end of the week. Both sides have used all their defensive and offensive weapons, such as heavy artillery bombardment, heavy bombing by large British aircraft, and infantry using hand grenades and bayonet combat. The Italian army also used mortars, and two of them and their artillery were captured. The British Scottish soldiers fought bravely, launching a fierce attack on Corene from the fortresses held by the British, encountering the fiercest counterattack from the Italian Alpine soldiers. The Scottish soldiers engaged in melee combat and repelled the Italian soldiers. A British Highland regiment climbed the hillside and advanced to within two miles of the outer car fortress road of Corene. On the right, Italian soldiers were stationed on both sides of the fortress road. British transportation and supply operations are proceeding smoothly, with mules being used extensively and water being transported continuously. Prisoners are constantly being sent to British military headquarters. According to a communiqué from the British military headquarters in Cairo, the Italian army in Corene, Eritrea, again attempted to counterattack unsuccessfully, suffering heavy casualties. Some dead and wounded Italian soldiers were abandoned on the battlefield. The battle of Corene is continuing to develop, although not very fast, it is progressing smoothly. The British army in central and southern Abyssinia is continuing to press forward against the retreating Italian army in various areas. (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>
<p>Cairo – The British General Headquarters announced late last night that Gala-el-Hbeib, 40 miles inside the Libyan border (150 miles inside Tobruk), had fallen into British hands. The 900 Italian troops stationed there and their commander were also captured. The communiqué stated that as the important battle in Cyrenaica, eastern Libya, continued, the British decided not to attack Gala-el-Hbeib, but to send small teams of scouts to monitor it. In the past few days, they finally obtained an opportunity to clear the battlefield and sent a team of British and Australian troops to attack. The engagement began yesterday, and after a short period of time, the commander of the Italian garrison in Gala-el-Hbeib surrendered his entire force in the afternoon. During the siege of Gala-el-Hbeib, the British army paid special attention to avoid damaging the remains of the Senussi sect, whose founder was healed there. (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>

<h3>German Aircraft Launch Another Fierce Attack; Plymouth</h3>
<p>Plymouth – After suffering unprecedented bombing here on Thursday night, German aircraft groups flew here again last night and dropped more than a thousand high-explosive bombs, with a very fierce force. Most of the shops and houses in the city were destroyed, with heavy losses, which cannot be estimated for the time being. (United Press report, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin – On the evening of the 20th, German aircraft concentrated their bombing on Plymouth. The weather was good at the time, and the visibility was clear. German aircraft hit important military targets, and fires broke out everywhere, with the burning area covering four square kilometers. The British naval arsenal and harbor were hit by heavy bombs. The British naval supply headquarters was also hit and caught fire. Several merchant ships in the harbor were hit and caught fire, and their hulls have tilted. (Haitong Electric report, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – As of dawn this morning, there were no traces of German aircraft in the London area. However, enemy aircraft had sneaked into a town on the southwest coast. Although they encountered fierce anti-aircraft fire, they dropped incendiary bombs and bombs from high altitude. During the day yesterday, German aircraft were not very active in England, only dropping bombs in two places on the Norfolk coast and several places on the Kent coast, and strafing a town on the southeast coast with machine guns. According to official sources, the damage was slight, and no residents were seriously injured. (Reuters report, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Random Talks on the European War (4) (1) General Remarks on European War Strategy</h3>
<p>This is a general discussion of European war strategy by the famous British military strategist Colonel Haud, originally published in the New York Herald Tribune, and translated here:</p>
<p>American commentator on important matters, Baldwin, once said in a vivid and insightful article, "The defense of the British Empire is naturally built on three major foundations: the first is the ocean, upon which the greatness of the British Empire is based; the second is the machinery of Manchester and the Midlands, upon which Britain's weapons of war depend; and the third is the air force."</p>
<p>He also said, "Now, due to the shift in the war situation, the British defense concept is very different from the arguments in Colonel Haud's book "Defending Britain," published before the start of the war," which surprised me.</p>
<p>Simply put, my view is that we should concentrate our greatest strength on the navy and air force, and reduce our efforts in the army to a minimum. However, we must have sufficient troops to defend our overseas territories, and we must have mechanized attack units to deal with situations where German forces break through French lines.</p>
<p>This theory is not empty, but based on practical considerations. If we spread our strength and try to make all aspects strong, the result will inevitably be that we lose sight of one while attending to the other, and none will be strong. This is a major mistake that Napoleon spoke of.</p>
<p>To form a powerful army is not only impossible in a short time, but also requires a large amount of industrial and financial resources, which are of course more urgently needed to maintain the navy and train an incomparably strong air force. Since the last World War, I have always argued that air supremacy will be a decisive factor in the Second World War.</p>
<p>Although I have advocated training mechanized attack units to be sent to France and the Middle East to fight, I have also stated that large numbers of infantry sent to Europe in batches will face the risk of their transportation lines being attacked and cut off by air force or mechanized units. Once transportation is cut off, the British forces in France will be in a dilemma and find themselves in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is better to use the industrial surplus beyond what is needed for the navy, air force, and mechanized units to provide modern equipment to France, so that their well-trained and large army can increase its strength. This is not the "theory of limited liability" but the basic common sense of fulfilling "preserving strength." A country that is invaded can only compete with time and win by appropriately directing its efforts. This is an unbreakable truth.</p>
<p>However, calm planning and a sense of proportion have been obscured by emotions and prejudices. Our allies only seek a large army, while neglecting the air force and air defense equipment. We are also putting the cart before the horse, and instead of focusing on emergency measures in the face of imminent disaster, we are training a large army.</p>
<p>Looking back, if our air force could have been on par with Germany's, the war might not have happened. This should be a commonly known fact. Even if the war could not be avoided, if our fighter and anti-aircraft gun strength had been twice as strong as last summer, or if a few mechanized divisions had been stationed in key locations and immediately counterattacked when the German forces broke through, the German invasion of France would have been hindered, and the threat to Britain would have been completely eliminated. Achieving this goal would have been easy, but it was delayed by traditional military concepts.</p>
<p>In this war, French and Belgian troops lost their ability to resist due to a lack of fighters to drive away German dive bombers. When the German forces broke through Sedan, they were unable to resist due to a lack of armored divisions, causing a fatal blow to the Allied forces.</p>
<p>In 1937, I suggested to the Minister of War, Mr. Belisha, to train six armored divisions, four of which could be sent to France to fight. However, in May 1940, when the German forces attacked, Britain only had one division that could be dispatched, and this division was stationed on the other side of the strait, and could not immediately go to help. As a result, the 400,000 infantrymen we sent to France were cut off from contact by the enemy, lost most of their equipment, and almost escaped empty-handed.</p>
<p>Mr. Baldwin believes that my current estimate of defensive power is as high as it was in my pre-war book "Defending Britain." In fact, looking at the past war situation, I can only answer him by saying that if the comparison of the strength and situation of both sides can be properly taken into account, then not only have I not overestimated the strength of the defense, but I have actually underestimated it. I have published this conclusion in the book: Generally speaking, the army taking the offensive must have a three-to-one advantage over the enemy, not only in terms of numbers, but also in terms of modern mechanized units such as airplanes and tanks.</p>
<p>The German army's estimate of modern defensive power seems to be no lower than mine, and in fact may be even higher than my estimate. Before taking the offensive, they were cautious and carefully created a three-to-one or greater advantage in modern equipment such as airplanes and tanks. According to reliable reports from the London Times, their airplanes were in a ratio of four to one, and their tanks were in a ratio of five to one. Moreover, I and a group of people who advocated mechanized warfare early on have stated that in future wars, it is necessary to adopt mobile tactics and surprise methods. When the German army took the offensive this time, it was able to fully develop the key points of this new war defense.</p>
<p>Not only that, but regarding the proportion of advantages, I carefully said in my pre-war conclusions that in certain situations, the proportion of advantages may not even reach a ratio of three to one. First, the attacking army only needs to strategically use the "lure the enemy" strategy to make the enemy empty out and swallow our bait; second, the battle line must be vast, so that the attacking army has ample room for activity, chooses the enemy's weak defenses, and takes advantage of the opportunity to attack its unpreparedness; third, the attacking army should use new weapons or new tactics to take the enemy by surprise and make them lose their resistance; and fourth, the defending army should have no leadership and improper command.</p>
<p>I have also said that the defending army must have sufficient airplanes to protect the airspace before it has any hope of resisting the enemy's superior army.</p>
<p>Although the German army had a great advantage in strength, they were still cautious and unwilling to risk attacking the Maginot Line head-on. Instead, they attacked the low-lying countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, on the one hand luring the French army away from the strong defensive works, and on the other hand extending the battle line as much as possible to obtain a large space for activity. At the same time, paratroopers and heavy tanks enabled them to achieve surprising victories.</p>
<p>In addition to these many advantages, the French Prime Minister's said "unimaginable mistakes of the French High Command" also contributed greatly to the German victory. The British and French troops did not know to rely on strongholds to defend and wait for the enemy to tire, but instead lightly left their base and advanced seventy miles, deep into Belgian territory, to defend an unprepared line on the Dyle River. Perhaps this was unavoidable due to political relations!</p>
<p>However, the actual military deployment cannot be explained by this. The entire left wing of the Allied forces advanced into western Belgium, but there was no defense in the area around the attacking hub of Belgian Luxembourg. It seems that they blindly used the principle of concentrating main forces according to regulations and misunderstood that the Ardennes forest was overlapping and hilly, and that the enemy's mechanized units could not be used there, which led to this mistake.

<h3>Group Kidnapping and Shooting: Misfortune for Bank Employees; Nearly Two Hundred People Kidnapped from Bank of China Villa; Eleven Dead and Wounded Among Jiangsu Farmers Bank Employees</h3>
<p>At around 11 PM the day before yesterday, a shocking bloody incident occurred at the dormitory of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank at No. 10, Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Eleven bank employees were tragically victimized innocently. Before long, more than one hundred bank employees in the Bank of China's staff quarters at No. 96 Route Ghisiere were suddenly handcuffed and kidnapped by armed personnel and plainclothes officers. At 5:45 AM, more than seventy people were kidnapped again. A total of nearly two hundred people were kidnapped, which is a shocking kidnapping case. The severity of the situation is unprecedented. The following is a detailed account of the information obtained by the Pingming News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Group Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>The Bank of China Villa at No. 96 Route Ghisiere, located near Route Keane, an extra-settlement road, has buildings with four, three, and two floors, numbered from 1 to 156. The houses are very spacious. The employees of the Bank of China in the two concessions of this city live there. Some live alone, and some live with their families and children, totaling about four or five hundred households, or about three thousand men and women. The Bank of China employees in the dormitory usually take a group car dispatched by the bank, except on holidays, to facilitate the employees' commute. At around midnight last morning, nearing curfew, dozens of armed personnel and plainclothes officers suddenly arrived in two cars. The employees in the dormitory were already in bed. After entering, the men woke them up one by one, handcuffed more than one hundred employees in pairs, and forcibly dragged them away. At that time, the families and children of the employees were shocked by the scene, but they could do nothing but watch them drive away.</p>
<p>Nearly Two Hundred People Kidnapped in Two Incidents</p>
<p>Not long after, at about 5:45 AM, a large number of armed personnel and plainclothes officers went to the site again and forcibly escorted another group of more than seventy employees onto a large car that usually picks up bank staff, parked inside the iron gate of the Bank of China Villa. The driver, Zhao Qilin, was forced to drive it south on Route Ghisiere and disappeared. In the two kidnappings, the number of people was close to two hundred, all of whom were middle- and lower-level employees. These people depend on their salaries to make a living and usually do not participate in political activities. It is understood that most of them were from the Chengdu Road office, and some were also from the Avenue Joffre, Tongfu Road, Rue Massenet, and Xinzha Road offices. Afterwards, more than a dozen armed teams guarded the entrance of the Bank of China Villa until they withdrew at 11 AM. It is rumored that a bank employee was kidnapped from the dormitory a month ago. All circles believe that the occurrence of this case is serious. After learning of this shocking mass kidnapping incident, the police authorities of the two concessions immediately sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to station at the entrances of the various branches of the Bank of China to provide strict security and protection.</p>
<p>Partial Release After Negotiations</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Datong News Agency reporter inquired with a senior official of the Bank of China about this matter. According to him, after negotiations by Mr. Hu (director of the Nanjing branch) of the bank in the morning, most of the personnel had been released. Starting next week, everyone can go to the bank to work as usual and will not delay business due to this matter. The reporter asked whether there were any senior officials living in the house. He said, "There are also some living there, such as the head of the cashier department, Mr. Tao Jincheng, who was also kidnapped and has not yet been released." Since the incident, the employees of the Bank of China's offices in this city have been very calm. Yesterday morning, they still operated as usual and were not affected. Yesterday morning, the financial market experienced a brief disturbance due to this incident. However, because a part of the staff released not long after and it was found that this matter would not have a major impact on Shanghai's finance, the market turned to be stable again. The reporter also asked someone from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department about the motives of this incident. According to him, they only knew the facts, and the motives were unknown. The Japanese authorities said that they had nothing to do with this matter, and the "Special Police" of western Shanghai said that they did not know about the incident.</p>
<p>List of Kidnapped Personnel</p>
<p>It is reported that the Bank of China personnel who have been identified as being kidnapped include Mao Yongfeng, Tao Jincheng, Zhang Xiaohang, Yan Zhiqiang, Zhang Liwei, Zhang Qiyun, Zhang Aiqi, Xu Yichen, Cao Shanqing, Ni Xiaoben, Qiu Qidi, He Huanbiao, Chen Nianqin, Zheng Shikang, Lu Hongchou, Zhu Shaohui, Lu Weihan, Sun Xiaonong, Hong Liren, Chen Guoxiang, Jing Guangzhao, Shen Weian, Gui Zhengrong, Wang Yifan, Yang Jicheng, He Shuangfu, Xu Banggui, Yu Zhaoan, Guo Zhongyun, Tu Hengren, Tang Fucheng, Sun Xingchu, Zhang Yanbo, Liu Lansheng, Mao Shiyang, Yang Zhongqu, Chen Shaowei, Hong Jiaxiu, Jin Wangtong, Gu Jian, Zheng Xueheng, Zhang Junfu, Xu Zhaoqing, Shi Guoqing, Wu Jiayuan, Wang Zhaoxuan, Gao Changlun, Lin Zhenlin, Dong Hanhan, Chen Zhaogui, Shen Xingsheng, Wu Zhongguo, Zhu Xinghan, Zhuang Xiaojin, Bai Zunwu, Zhou Ji, Yan Tongwen, Fan Zong..., Tian Baoqing, Zhu Songren, He Liyun, Li Gonglin, Zhang Fuzhai, Lao Guangchu, Lao Lizhai, Ni Biaodong, Jin Bingzhang, Jing Tailai, Zhang Zuda, Huang Shizhen, Zhu Jianming, Cao Xiangguang, Xu Deqing, Zheng Chunxi, Liu Bangda, Xu Maozhao, Han Xinbao, Kuang Yongxin, Lu Zijin, Liu Benkun, Lin Maosong, Jiang Chuanlin, Yao Shirong, Jiang Xiaodi, Zhang Jia願, Lu Shude, Qin Bingkuan, Zhang Xianda, Gao Ben, Jiang Renliang, Chen Zilin, Meng Shulian, Yan Huanzhang, Zhou Yaojin, Chen Yaliang, Xu Bingsong, Qian Tingdong, Wang Zengqi, Zhang Yongzhong, Yang Tongwu, Xue Yidu, Gui Qizhang, Zhang Maosun, Liu Yongquan, Wu Yuying, Wo Hongyu, Zhang Zhidong, Jiang Zishan, Zhu Qiutao, Du Qingzao, Huang Nian, Ye Xuhua, Zhang Chenglian, Lu Qingpei, Zhou Qizhi, Mu Kexin, Hua Zengxiang, Ge Binggu, Zhao Quanlin, Yang Zhiluo, Ye Naiqiu, Yang Yihe, Yang Shaoqing, Hong Jieren, Ma Buzhou, Shen Zhenyi, Yu Guoliang, Yu Tingyun, and others.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Shooting Massacre</p>
<p>At around 11 PM the night before last (the 21st), a shocking bloody incident suddenly occurred at the dormitory of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank at No. 10, Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. At that time, eight murderers posing as detectives from the patrol station broke into the dormitory and fired more than three shots. Details of what was seen in yesterday's newspaper are continued below.</p>
<p>Opening Fire: Blood Splatters Everywhere</p>
<p>At 11:50 PM the night before last, two black-plated cars carrying many men, all carrying box guns, and one carrying a submachine gun, suddenly stopped at the entrance of Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre. At that time, one of the cars blocked the entrance of the lane, and a machine gun was set up. Then, six men jumped out of the car. Two of them pointed guns at the gatekeeper of the lane, Zhang Deyuan (34 years old, from Jiangbei), and monitored him. The rest walked to the entrance of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank dormitory at No. 10, pressed the doorbell. At that time, Ling Chuan (52 years old, from Songjiang), the tea servant who was sleeping downstairs, had already been awakened and got up to ask. The visitor answered that they were night investigators. Ling thought they were patrol station personnel and hurriedly pulled open the iron gate and opened the door to let them in. Unexpectedly, they each took out box guns and ordered Ling to lead them upstairs, straight to the dormitory on the second floor. They woke up the six employees in the room who were fast asleep, forced them to get up, and then went straight to the third floor and the fake fourth floor. They gathered all eleven employees in the bedroom on the second floor, had them stand in line, and opened fire on them without asking questions. Five or sixty shots were fired, and blood splattered everywhere for a while. It was a terrible sight. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the men went outside, jumped into the original car, and fled.</p>
<p>Six Dead, Five Injured</p>
<p>Afterwards, gatekeeper Zhang Deyuan reported to the Avenue Edward VII Patrol Station based on the information, and a large team of armed Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to search the vicinity, but to no avail. They immediately entered to investigate and found that five of the employees who had been shot had died on the spot from their serious injuries, while the rest were groaning in pools of blood. They then called for cars to send the dead and wounded employees to the coroner's office and the hospital for treatment. In this incident, the employees who were tragically killed included (1) Zhang Shaozhen (from Yancheng), (2) Wan Deyi (from Zhenjiang), (3) Xue Yushan (from Yancheng), (4) Chu Hualong (from Rugao), and (5) Fan Jingjiang (from Zhenjiang). The injured included (1) Xi Shen (26 years old, from Nantong), (2) Zhang Shusheng (25 years old, from Huaiyin), (3) Li Kewen (from Yangzhou), (4) Cheng Xiuming (32 years old, from Shanghai), (5) Shen Yongzuo (from Yancheng), and (6) Tao Zhongqi (30 years old). Among them, Xi Shen was shot in a vital part and died in Guangci Hospital at 3 AM yesterday morning. Tao Zhongqi was grazed by a bullet on his waist, his injury was minor, and he was discharged from the hospital after bandaging. According to records, there were a total of eighteen boarders in the dormitory. In addition to the above-mentioned persons, there were also employees Feng Zanyuan, Xu Hanjun, Dai Daguan (all from Rugao), and tea servants Cheng Zhenyuan, Wang Chengji, 隽夢麟, and Ling Chuan. Feng worked in a small office on the third floor, so the rioters pushed open the door and entered without noticing him, and Xu heard a slight noise and quickly locked the door, so both of them were spared.</p>
<p>Major Banks Take Precautions</p>
<p>After the major bloody incident occurred, the patrol station paid attention to the various banks in the concession and dispatched detectives to station in the banks for protection yesterday morning. At the same time, iron nets were set up at various important roads at any time in the morning to search the passing pedestrians and vehicles. The patrol station has sent a large number of detectives to the No. 10 house, the location of the major bloody incident, to strictly prohibit the entry and exit of all people. The reporter went to inspect it and still saw fresh blood on the ground at the door. It is also learned that the six dead bank employees were sent to the Talas Road morgue. After examination in the afternoon, representatives of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, together with the family members of the deceased in Shanghai, claimed the bodies and sent them to the Shanghai Funeral Home to handle the funeral affairs. The five seriously injured people underwent surgery by doctors, and the treatment is going well and should not endanger their lives.</p>
<h3>Power Company Receives Relief: 9,000 Tons of Machine Oil; Foreign Merchant Has Agreed to Supply; But Users Still Need to Conserve</h3>
<p>A senior official of the Shanghai Power Company told reporters yesterday that a foreign oil company in Shanghai has agreed to supply the company with 9,000 tons of oil. This move will be very helpful in solving the company's fuel shortage problem, because one ton of oil can produce the same amount of electricity as one and a half tons of coal. The official warned users not to expect too much from this matter, because this amount of oil can only slightly improve the fuel shortage problem, but cannot fundamentally solve it. The fundamental solution still depends on improving the transportation problem. According to reports, in 1937, the Shanghai Power Company tested the use of oil for power generation to prevent fuel shortages, and later invested 500,000 yuan to build boilers for oil-fired power generation. The oil purchased this time is specifically for the new boilers.</p>
<h3>Urge the Communist Party to Awaken: Abide by Past Promises; Reflect on Themselves More and Not Be Petulant; Complete the Anti-Japanese Construction in a Unified Government; The City Farmers' Association Rectification Committee Cables the Seven Communist Party Senators</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Farmers' Association Rectification Committee, because the New Fourth Army did not abide by military discipline, resulting in its dissolution, refused to attend the Second National Political Council, and would expand the dispute on the pretext, specially cabled a loyal admonition, to abide by promises, so as to complete the anti-Japanese construction under the unified military orders of the unified government. The following is an excerpt of the original text:</p>
<p>New Fourth Army Incident: Commonly Heard and Seen</p>
<p>Yan'an Politician Mao Zedong, and transferred to Lin Zuhan, Chen Shaoyu, Qin Bangxian, Wu Yuzhang, Deng Yingchao, Dong Biwu and other gentlemen, sir: if military orders are not uniform, how can we command operations? If military discipline is not strict, how can we succeed? The New Fourth Army despises government laws and calls it democratic politics, destroys the administrative system and calls it the anti-Japanese regime, abuses the expansion of troops and demands food from the people, calling it national salvation public grain, and excludes dissidents, blaming people and calling them stubborn elements. All these illegal and undisciplined actions are commonly heard and seen by hundreds of thousands of people in the north and south of the Yangtze River. Yet, you still believe that this is the reckless action of a few lower-level cadres in the army who do not understand the overall situation, and you have endured it for a long time. Regardless of whether you gentlemen can distinguish between right and wrong, you are covering up for it, and even using it as an excuse to make use of it. May I ask, what about the solemn oath in September 1937?</p>
<p>Future Actions: Watched by the Public</p>
<p>Moreover, after four years of combat, a dawn is in sight. The reason why our people do not avoid sacrifice, do not care about their lives, and do their utmost to support national policies is only to seek the integrity of land sovereignty and the revival of the nation and the nation. And since September 1937, the reason why we have sympathized with and looked forward to your party is also because your party has solemnly declared that it will abandon the selfishness of one party and one class and is willing to support the government and strive for national liberation. This attitude has not changed so far. In the future, our view of the real party will be based on what your party says and measures what your party does.</p>
<p>Work Together to Complete the Great Cause</p>
<p>You gentlemen are all contemporary heroes who have experienced hardships. We must guard against the danger of being together and the overturned nest. I hope that you will abide by your original intentions, practice what you preach, reflect on yourselves more, and do not be petulant, so that under the unified military orders of the unified government, the great cause of anti-Japanese construction can be completed as soon as possible. The future of the country and the nation is deeply dependent on it. Sincerely, the Shanghai City Farmers' Association Rectification Committee, bowed.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Downstream Dredging Completed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dredging Bureau, in view of the approaching spring tide, has decided to start dredging the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in accordance with the planned plan for the Huangpu River, Wusong River, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The large dredger "Jianshe" was dispatched to work in mid-April and was scheduled to be completed within one month. According to the Bureau yesterday, the project has progressed smoothly and has been fully dredged the day before yesterday. However, the total project of the Huangpu River, the middle section has been dredged, and the upper and lower sections are now being dredged by various small dredgers in sections. As for the dredging of the Wusong River, before the "August 13th" Incident, the Bureau sent a dredger to gradually dredge it from the Garden Bridge to the west of Brahma Royal Ferry. After the war, it was suspended, and so far the silt has accumulated day by day, and the previous work has been abandoned. Therefore, it has been decided to re-dredge it to facilitate the current flow. The Bureau has no intention of restoring the dredging of the Shintan outside the Wusongkou in the shortest possible time, because according to the current environment, dredging there is not yet necessary.</p>
<h3>Fund-Raising Donation Campaign: Enthusiastic Voluntary Contributions; Some Wealthy Families Donate 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the fund-raising donation campaign in this city, remarkable results have been achieved. Although it cannot be carried out publicly due to the special environment, it has not slightly restricted its activities due to the special environment since it is a voluntary donation. According to recent news, there are not a few wealthy merchants and wealthy businessmen who donate 10,000 or 20,000 yuan alone, and there is no need to mention those who donate thousands of yuan. It is said that a certain wealthy family in Shanghai has scheduled to donate 100,000 yuan, which can be said to be the highest record of national fund-raising donations.</p>
<h3>Xu Weizhen: No News After Being Kidnapped; Hospital Affairs Proceed as Usual</h3>
<p>Since Xu Weizhen, the president of the Higher Court Second Branch, was kidnapped, there has been no news. A Pingming News Agency reporter went to the Higher Court Second Branch yesterday to visit the responsible officials. They claimed that the hospital had no news about the kidnapping of President Xu. However, this is purely President Xu's personal misfortune and has nothing to do with the entire hospital. Since the Central Government issued a clear order for Judge Guo of the Second Special Court to temporarily act as the president, the responsible person has been appointed, and the hospital affairs are proceeding as usual and will never be interrupted. Then, it was also claimed that regarding the dredging of the prison, it is said that it is based on the Interim Measures for Serving Sentences Outside Prison promulgated by the Central Government. The Shanghai Municipal Council Prison is also applicable. Inmates of good character, after being reviewed by the prison warden and approved by the court, can be released on bail to work outside. As of last year, it is estimated that one or two hundred inmates were released on bail to work outside in accordance with the measures for serving sentences outside prison. The date of implementation of the measures has ended at the end of last year. Before the Central Government issues a clear order to approve the extension, it should be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Prison Guards Request a Raise</h3>
<p>The entire body of prison guards in the Public Concession, numbering over two thousand, given that the cost of living has reached an extreme high, and their salaries are difficult to sustain them, have specially organized an overall office of prison guards, established a mutual aid group, and jointly requested assistance from the police authorities, and urged the owners to improve their treatment, in order to maintain their livelihoods. They have also submitted a detailed table of price and cost of living indexes from before and after the war, petitioning the owners to improve their treatment. Furthermore, they have newly drafted four articles of the mutual aid group's constitution: (1) To encourage the spirit of service; (2) To protect the safety of employers; (3) To ensure the safety of life and death among members; (4) To stabilize living conditions, so as to be able to serve loyally and faithfully.</p>
<h3>The French Electricity Strike Reaches a Stalemate, Resumption of Service Unlikely in the Near Future; Labor and Management Both Take Extreme Positions; The French Political Department Suspends Mediation Again Yesterday; The Public Concession's Transportation Strike is Completely Resolved</h3>
<p>The strike at the French-owned water and electricity company, after efforts at mediation by the Political Department of the French police, had a prospect of resumption of work at 4:45 PM the day before yesterday. News spread, and citizens were all delighted. At that time, all the workers on the labor side had gathered in front of the factory, intending to enter immediately and resume work. Unexpectedly, due to a lack of understanding between the two sides, a sudden change occurred, leading to failure. Yesterday, the labor side announced a formal strike, and the Political Department suspended mediation again yesterday. The strike event has reached a stalemate. Citizens who heard the news were deeply disappointed, hoping that both sides would prioritize the public interest and resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Failure to Resume Work</p>
<p>The strike at the French electricity company, after the French police's Political Department made every effort to mediate, and presented two proposals to the labor side: (1) Resume work first; (2) The demands raised will be guaranteed to be answered in full before the 25th. The labor side considered it satisfactory and expressed agreement. Thus, at 4:45 PM the day before yesterday (the 21st), all 2,000 workers went from the Nanshi area to gather in front of the factory on Rue Luber. They then presented two preconditions for resuming work to the management: immediately release the arrested workers and remove the factory's guard. If the management agreed, they could resume work immediately. However, this was rejected by the management. Thereupon, all the workers angrily left the factory and returned to the Nanshi area. There was a minor disturbance at the time, but fortunately, no accidents occurred. However, the effort to resume work ended in failure. The widespread rumors of resumption of work originated from this.</p>
<p>Formal Strike</p>
<p>The labor side, after this incident, felt quite stimulated. At 10:00 AM yesterday, they convened a general meeting in the public sports field in Nanshi, believing that the past few days had only been a slowdown, and resolved to formally strike from yesterday onwards, and organized a "Strike Committee," extinguishing the glimmer of hope for resolving the labor unrest. However, according to the labor side, if the management agrees to release the arrested workers and remove the guard, they can resume work at any time, in order to hold negotiations to resolve the matter. However, the management has already refused to recognize the matter of arresting workers. Since this incident occurred, the French authorities have increased security for the water and electricity company. The iron mesh barriers on Rue Luber, Rue Conty, and Rue Luber at the intersection of Xujiahui Road, which were previously allowed pedestrians to pass through, were completely closed yesterday. At the same time, inquiries were made to the company's management. Because the labor side insisted on striking, the company side has allowed it to take its course. Furthermore, there is currently a shortage of both coal and diesel, so there is no urgent need to resume work.</p>
<p>British Electricity Resolved</p>
<p>The conditions for improving treatment proposed by the workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, after labor and management both expressed sincerity in negotiations, were directly negotiated at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday by six representatives from the labor side, with the company's manager, Evan, and compradore, Hu Ziyu. An agreement was reached and announced, resolving the issue: (1) A 10% increase in wages and a 15% increase in living allowance (totaling a 25% increase); (2) A rice subsidy, where for every 10 yuan that the price of rice per picul exceeds 100 yuan, the rice subsidy will increase by 20 cents per person per day; (3) The company recognizes six worker representatives; (4) The calculation of special bonuses includes allowances.</p>
<p>Public Buses</p>
<p>The workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, due to issues of compensation, went on strike on the 19th. After mediation resolved the issue, all the workers resumed work that evening. The worker rice subsidy for March was issued by the company the day before yesterday, with each person temporarily receiving 55 national currency yuan for five piculs of rice, and the retail price of rice surveyed by the Public Works Department on March 21st was used as the standard for the rice subsidy price. As for the workers' living allowance, the company agreed to consider it. Yesterday, the worker representatives negotiated again with the company's manager, Arnold Jones, and agreed that the worker's living allowance would be increased by 65 cents per person per day, totaling one yuan with the previous 35 cents.</p>
<h3>British Residents in Shanghai to Hold a Day of Prayer Today</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Elections Expected to be Resolved Smoothly; Understanding Reached Among Expatriate Communities; If an Agreement is Reached, Elections May Not Be Necessary</h3>
<p>According to the "The China Press", sources from the authorities state that the Shanghai Municipal Council has submitted a request to the Consular Body, suggesting that the originally scheduled annual Council elections on April 2nd and 3rd be postponed by one week, and changed to April 9th and 10th. If this request is approved, expatriate groups in Shanghai can use this period of hesitation to adjust the issue of seats on the Shanghai Municipal Council for the coming year, and the Municipal Council elections may not need to be held. Recently, there have been many rumors about the Municipal Council elections, but none have been confirmed. A more credible report is that all parties are now trying to reconcile several long-standing disputes. This work is progressing very smoothly, and it is hoped that results can be achieved before the election is held. Municipal Council officials neither acknowledge nor deny that the Consular Body has approved the postponement of the election, only stating that they cannot express an opinion until they receive formal notification from the Consular Body. However, information obtained from other sources confirms that expatriate groups have been discussing the issue for several weeks, and have reached an understanding on the upcoming election of the Municipal Council. Responsible parties claim that if expatriate groups can reach an agreement on the issue, they will nominate candidates in accordance with the existing seats. If this is the case, the Municipal Council elections may not need to be held.</p>

<h3>Jing'an Temple Police Uncover a Counterfeit Currency Organization, Detain Ten Male and Female Suspects, Confiscate Over 1,000 Yuan in Counterfeit Currency</h3>

<h3>Finance: The Future of the National Currency Becomes Brighter, The Black Market Shakes More Violently, News of Huang Lun Having Stopped the Supply of Black Market Foreign Exchange, Foreign Merchants Eagerly Rush to Buy Foreign Exchange, Becoming Unusually Active</h3>
<p>Regarding the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC listing remained unchanged. The trend in the dark market for British and American foreign exchange was tightening. According to a telegram from London, the recent weakness of China's national currency is due to China's Exchange Stabilization Fund not wanting to support the black market, not because China's Exchange Stabilization Fund is unable to do so, but because it is unwilling to do so. Currently, negotiations are underway between China and Britain to ensure that British gold's aid to China's Exchange Stabilization Fund is not used to support Shanghai's black market, so as to reduce leakage. Therefore, there is a saying that the Exchange Stabilization Board will stop supplying foreign exchange to this city. As a result, people's hearts are agitated. In fact, this kind of action is within the range of what should be done. If Britain and the United States want to maintain the national currency, then the most important question is how to maintain the funds they supply. If there is no way to solve this problem, the effect of supporting the national currency is equal to zero. Although the funds for maintenance come in continuously, and the foreign exchange in the black market still flows away continuously, then what is actually being maintained is not the national currency, but those who use the national currency to seize foreign exchange. Therefore, Britain and the United States would rather not maintain the Chinese national currency. If they want to maintain it, they must first find a way to plug the loopholes in Shanghai's black market foreign exchange. The way to plug the loopholes is nothing more than stopping the supply of foreign exchange. At the beginning of its implementation, it seems that the price of foreign exchange will soar and the value of the national currency will plummet. In fact, it is precisely the price of the national currency that will be as firm as a diamond and as constant as the sun and moon from now on. Small collapses will not completely destroy it, and the value of the national currency reflected by the temporary sharp drop in foreign exchange prices is a fantasy created by the eagerness to seize foreign exchange with the national currency. It is a temporary surge in the need for foreign exchange, and the supply may be interrupted. There are many who seek it, and few who supply it, so it seems that foreign exchange is very precious, and the fall of foreign currencies is frightening. I don't know that the true exchange rate of the national currency against foreign exchange will only see it rise, and will not see it fall, but the black market is the opposite. As for Chinese merchants who need foreign exchange for legitimate and reliable purposes, if the supply of foreign exchange in the black market really stops, then the foreign exchange obtained through applications and permissions will be longer than that obtained from the black market. Therefore, the realization of this measure will only increase the value of the national currency, rather than devaluing it again. Yesterday, general foreign banks were already planning ahead and buying foreign exchange from the black market, causing the black market exchange rate to tighten again. Japanese merchants especially rushed to buy, fearing that this opportunity would be missed and not easily obtained again. Speculators also bought more and sold less, causing the market to be easy to tighten and difficult to loosen. At noon, it softened to 32.25 cents and 5.3125 yuan, but the closing price was 32.265625 cents and 5.34375 yuan, resulting in a squeeze of 0.046875 and 0.0625. Futures were slightly tighter.</p>
<p>A Buying Spree Temporarily Prevails</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the large London contracts, the near-term contracts were squeezed by 0.0625 each. New York silver prices and London raw gold were both flat. Exchange rates, such as the US dollar against Shanghai, did not fluctuate. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning. British gold was 32.3125 cents, and the US dollar was 5.40625 yuan, with no honor or disgrace compared to the previous day. It was still flat after opening, but soon there was a certain good news rumor in the banking industry in this city, and a buying spree suddenly broke out. Japanese banks and speculators bought and sold each other, and the market tightened as a result. It is estimated that the March contracts were opened at 5.40625 yuan and 3.375 for the US dollar. The HSBC listing was announced to remain unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced to be slightly 0.025. After that, the foreign firms also followed suit, and the situation gradually softened. At 10:15 am, British gold had tightened to 32.28125 cents, and the US dollar had shrunk to 5.34375 yuan. Then, the buyers slightly decreased, and it had turned flat. The current US dollar can be settled at 5.375 yuan. Hedgers had tried to sell, but soon heard a telegram from London, saying that the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee was afraid of not maintaining the Shanghai black market. The buying spree then reignited, and foreign firms and speculators came to buy again. It is estimated that the March British gold contracts were opened at 32.28125 and 25 cents, and the March-April US dollar was 5.34375 yuan. At noon, the current US dollar shrank to 5.3125 yuan, and British gold softened to 32.22 cents. However, the closing price was slightly flat. British gold was reported at 31.265625 cents, and the US dollar was 5.34375 yuan, while futures British gold was reported at 32.25 cents, and the US dollar was 5.3125 yuan. As a result, spot British gold tightened 0.046875, the US dollar softened 0.0625, futures British gold shrank 0.0625, and the US dollar tightened 0.09375 compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises Alone</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd (Saturday), the exchange market opened steadily this morning, except that the Shanghai Exchange spot rose alone by one yuan, with the price called at 153 yuan, and there were no other changes.</p>

The "Joint Note" dark market rose slightly by one dime, to 70.09 yuan.</p>
<h3>Many Things Happened in the Financial World, Gold Prices Soared</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was a dark market, because shocking incidents occurred in the China and Su Nong Banks in this city. At about 10:30, a London telegram stated that the Exchange Stabilization Board would stop supplying foreign exchange to this city, causing the vain hearts of all parties in recent days to be terrified and suddenly prosper. The dark market for foreign exchange tightened, causing gold prices to soar in an extraordinary buying spree. The price had flown out of the 6,400 yuan mark. With the buying momentum of Tianyuan, Rencheng Yong, Dafeng, and Hengji, the securities gang Yida actually bought more than 10,000 taels. The supply and demand situation was very different, so in a situation where it was easy to rise and difficult to return, the price rose from 6,370 yuan in the morning to 6,490 yuan. Later, gold and silver shops reappeared, and the noon animal husbandry slightly fell to 6,479 yuan, still squeezing up 119 yuan. 45,000 taels were traded in half a day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. The off-market price soared again to 6,525 yuan. The seller of the swap (March to April) had to pay the buyer 50 yuan. No cash price was heard. The forward price was 250 to 270 yuan higher. Ornaments rose by ten yuan, reaching 690 yuan. Customs gold, etc., were all flat.</p>
<p>500 Yuan for Customs Gold Off-Market</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), at the opening, because the exchange market reported tightly, most shouted to buy in accordance with the listing, and immediately raised ten yuan, to 6,370 yuan. After that, coupled with rumors of a certain building doing well on the market, it was difficult to settle the US dollar at 5.40625 yuan for this month, and the buying spree became more heated. Tianyuan, Yida, and Rencheng Yong came to absorb first, and soon Dafeng, Hengji, and Xianghe also followed and forced their way in, soaring eighty yuan, reaching 6,450 yuan. Later, the exchange market stabilized slightly, and Tong Kangyong, Defu, and Xiangxing Yong suddenly had the intention to sell, once falling back to 6,420 yuan, but eventually because the foreign exchange softened again, Dafeng frantically bought on behalf of the hedgers, and Tong Kangyong and Defu also changed from selling to buying, and rose again to 6,475 yuan. Then, Shunyuan and Decheng spat out, and it fell back slightly again. At this time, Hengji suddenly tended to spit and plug, and it also fell back slightly to 6,440 yuan. Eventually, because people's hearts were upward, and it was heard that the London telegram said that the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee had abandoned maintaining the black market foreign exchange, the short side Shunyuan, Lianxing, etc. painfully cut and settled, and Xianghe also bought. By noon, it had actually risen to 6,490 yuan, but before the close, Chengji and Hengji sold off, and the result was 6,470 yuan, 119 yuan higher than the previous day. The closing price of the US dollar at 5.3125 yuan in April was 6,555 yuan, about 76 yuan. Fluctuations of 120 yuan in half a day. The off-market trend was very strong. Shunyuan Decheng searched to buy, and a lot of deals were made at 6,495 yuan. Although the market was closed on Saturday afternoon, there was a deal at 6,525 yuan off-market. The in-house gold of the spot shop was 300 yuan higher than the futures price, and the intake was 80 yuan lower than the sale. There were no openings for current standard gold, etc.</p>
<p>Silver Shop Ornaments are Listed at Ten Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The exchange price of silverware jewelry per tael, at 10:15 am, was listed ten yuan higher. Datonghang changed to hang at 690 yuan. The new shop's price was similar to the above price, and the intake was reduced by about 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Followed and Rose Significantly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, the dark market price soared, and British and American gold pounds rose by three yuan. British gold notes remained stagnant, and the market price stood flat. The US gold note rose from 18.24 to 45 cents, up 28 cents from the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose with the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate by three cents. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes continued to rise strongly. The former had reached two yuan, and the latter rose to 1.64 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Merchants are Still Stirring up Trouble, A Large Batch of Rice and Grain Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The off-market black market for foreign rice rebounded yesterday. Opening early, large customers stockpiled because of the successive days of depreciation, and they were all reluctant to let go. Seeing this situation, actual sellers were afraid of causing further major changes and sought to take action first. They searched for cheap goods, and general floating households also seized the opportunity, which was unusually difficult to control. The situation was one of reversal from weakness to tightness. Japanese merchants still had shipments, and the pegged price climbed step by step. By the middle of the market, small assorted rice had opened at 3,500 yuan and reached 3,900 yuan, and Saigon No. 2 had opened at 3,300 yuan and reached 3,600 yuan. Only Saigon No. 1 was uniquely inferior in its path and was more difficult to fully supply. High-quality goods opened at 3,300 yuan, secondary goods at 3,100 yuan, and 3,000 yuan. Fire assorted rice and Siamese rice had not been heard to open. At this point, because there were quite a few original root customers taking advantage of the high prices to leave the market, the black market's rising momentum was quelled. Afterwards, it hovered all the way until the close without rising again, and it felt that the market had become slightly softer. It is estimated that the closing price of small assorted rice was 3,800-900 yuan, middle quality at 3,700 yuan, high quality Saigon No. 1 at 3,200-300 yuan, secondary at 3,000 yuan, rice green and broken tip at 3,000 yuan, 2,800 yuan, and Tokyo broken tip at 3,500-600 yuan, an increase of about two yuan compared to the morning price of the previous market, and a massive increase of several yuan compared to the afternoon.</p>
<p>Thick and thin Japonica rice and other domestic rice arrived in a rush, and suddenly became tired, holding the determination to quickly sell. However, the local shops were still sluggish, so they had to shake the price to solicit customers. At that time, the falling momentum was particularly strong, plummeting by about four yuan. Kunshan dou saw high-quality white japonica rice open at 120 yuan, middle quality at 118 yuan, and secondary at 116 yuan. Qingjiao dou saw thin japonica rice open at 112 yuan. Only Changbang special japonica rice, with fewer arrivals, was not so fierce, depreciating by two or three yuan, opening at 124-5 yuan, and ordinary at 122 yuan. As for the original packages, they were not opened at four or five yuan, and glutinous rice green was 97-8 yuan to 95 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is quite prosperous. The Jardine Matheson steamboat, loaded with large quantities of foreign rice and foreign flour from Hong Kong, was expected to arrive in port yesterday afternoon, but had not arrived by evening. According to the company, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning, so the amount loaded must wait until the ship arrives in Shanghai to be known. We will report again later. It is heard that the French liner Albert Sarraut, managed by the manager of the Warren Yanghang, arrived directly from Saigon with a large amount of foreign rice, amounting to over 24,000 bags, and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. The Glen liner will also arrive from Saigon with a large amount of foreign rice, and is expected to arrive tomorrow. The Compagnie des Messageries Maritimes postal ship brought a huge amount of foreign rice from Saigon this time, amounting to as many as 70,000 bags, and is expected to arrive in port on the 25th. Also, yesterday, 2,000 bags of flour were transported to Yantai. (Ancestral)</p>
<h3>Flour Stockpiling and Price Reduction: Flour Prices Slightly Rebound</h3>
<p>Flour: The spot market for foreign flour initially weakened but then stabilized. This was due to the increasing accumulation of inventory as flour transshipped from Hong Kong gradually arrived. Local merchants made actual sales and adopted a wait-and-see approach. Large dealers mostly stored their goods in warehouses, waiting for prices to rise before selling. Small retailers, burdened by stockpiles, were unable to sustain the pressure and began to reduce prices. "Golden Dragon" brand flour decreased to 29 yuan, while "Flower Bird Clock Tower" brand Australian flour was priced at 29.56 yuan. The price decline was quite steep. However, the market showed some signs of stabilization in the afternoon, as the rice market rebounded and local merchants and speculators bought up flour at lower prices. As a result, the market closed higher, recovering 1.2 yuan. Flat-priced flour from Chinese factories, supplied by Fuxin Mill, remained at 5,873 bags, priced at 25 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market maintained its usual level. The supply of inland Du wheat has been exhausted for a long time, and spot goods have been nearly completely purchased. On the Chinese factory side, Fufeng Mill has already ceased production, with only Fuxin Mill continuing to supply flat-priced flour and continuing to order foreign flour to supplement its supply. The price of high-quality Du wheat is said to be around 45 yuan. However, due to the flat decline in the flour market, the overall situation has also softened.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Experience a Slight Price Drop</h3>
<p>Public Bonds (Grey Market): Yesterday, the market suddenly experienced an unexpected price drop. This was because several employees of the Bank of China were arrested for no apparent reason. As a result, the bank still opened for business as usual until around 11:00 am. However, this sparked baseless rumors among the public, making the already uncertain bond market even more unstable. Yesterday, being Saturday, there was only one trading session in the morning. It opened slightly lower, and the sales volume from Lianhe Yiji Hengkang was quite high. Although Kang Xinfu made purchases, the market price still fell by a small amount. Later, Shunchang Hengfu made purchases, and the price rose by several cents. However, sales from Yitai Runde caused the price to fall again. In reality, this news was not particularly significant. However, it inevitably caused a slight decline in market confidence. Trading was suspended in the afternoon, and the market price ended up falling by six to nine cents across the board. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.5 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 500 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity stock were traded at a price of 8.1 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Friday) dispatch: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far Eastern British company stocks remained flat. Only Mercantile Bank shares rebounded by five shillings, priced at 8 pounds 15 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Rumors of Favorable News Cause Cotton Yarn Prices to Rebound</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned from weakness to strength, and the price rebound resumed. This was due to various rumors that were all beneficial to buyers, which strengthened market sentiment. However, in order to promote the sale of spot goods, factories lowered the price of "Double Horse" brand spot goods by 100 yuan per bale compared to factory orders. As a result, some who had speculated on warehouse receipts rushed to close their positions, causing the market to decline. However, purchases by Hong Kong merchants were more active, sales were brisk, and rising margins rekindled speculative buying. In short, the current situation is still in a state of fluctuation. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,404 yuan, and the low price was 1,375 yuan. In the afternoon, margins in the grey market were favorable, and market sentiment was firm, with trades done at 1,411-1,412 yuan. Yesterday, 1,225 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Morning Opening: Due to the sharp decline in the afternoon of the previous day, market sentiment for "Double Horse" brand yarn continued to be loose at the morning opening. The opening price was 1,386 yuan, and it slightly fell to 1,375 yuan shortly after. Then, it was heard that the exchange rate had tightened and margins had increased, and buying suddenly surged on the trading floor, with very high bids, pushing the price up to 1,404 yuan. However, some profit-takers sold, causing the price to fall back to 1,396 yuan. Subsequently, due to strong sales in the Hong Kong market and continued high margins, the situation was good, and the price continued to rise to close at 1,407 yuan. According to statistics, the transaction volume for the half-day was 16,000 bales. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 1,000</p>
<p>Nanyang: 50</p>
<p>Local Traders: 14,500</p>
<p>Total: 16,000</p>
<h3>Cotton Sales Improve</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains high, but factory purchases are not strong. However, industry participants have a good outlook, so mutual buying and selling is quite active, and the situation is improving. It is noted that spot cotton for this week has increased by five to ten yuan or more compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 39,700 dan. The opening prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Pengjiapo 283.5, Dade: 200 pieces for warehouse delivery</p>
<p>Bailuo Qu 241.0, Junchang: 200 pieces</p>
<p>Also 242.0, Also: 100 pieces</p>
<p>Also 242.0, Shen Yuanlai: 100 pieces</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was quiet but firm, rising due to buying by industry participants and good cotton cloth trading. The closing price was five to ten points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian cotton trading was very small, rising initially due to buying by intermediaries, then falling back due to profit-taking, and finally rising again due to short covering. Prices for various brands rose by one to four and a half rupees. The forecast for today's opening is a rise of one and a half rupees.</p>
<p>Liverpool English cotton futures fell by six points each, and there was no market for spot goods.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market is thriving because of the prospering cotton yarn market. Various parties' buying intentions are strong, so the market situation is still lively and active.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Progress in Actual Sales of Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market opened flat yesterday morning but suddenly turned firm and strong in the afternoon. This was because the gold price rose sharply, boosting the appetite of industry participants and speculators. Additionally, actual sales also progressed, so sales prices for various cloths turned from flat to rising. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill cloth rose by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece, while colored cloth, flannel, etc., rose by 5 to 7.5 cents per piece. Local street transactions involved over 600 pieces of spot goods for various cloths and over 300 pieces of futures for March-April delivery. The dyeing factories had stronger demand. Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, and Ningbo merchants purchased over 200 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth, while Fujian and Guangdong merchants purchased over 300 pieces of blue cloth, serge, and colored twill cloth in coarse, fine, and white varieties. Yesterday, 400 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Dagu, 20 pieces to Yantai, and 1,065 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Tokyo: The morning market fluctuated and rose. The spot price for white cloth, "Dragon Head" fine cloth, was 48.25 yuan. Later in the market, it was heard that the price in the grey market was rising, and market sentiment improved. However, due to the fact that it was Saturday and there was no market, there were no transactions. The closing price for "Four Gentlemen" serge at midday was 1.075 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Futures for Raw and Refined Sugar Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market experienced significant gains in raw and refined sugar futures due to speculator absorption. The guild's clearing prices for spot goods were 83.9 yuan to 84.7 yuan for No. 2-4 raw white sugar, an increase of 1.6 yuan. The prices for contracts closing at the end of March initially traded at 83.6 yuan, then rose to 84.8-84.9 yuan, a similar increase. The prices for contracts closing on April 10 initially traded at 83.8-84.4 yuan, then rose to 85.2-85.3 yuan, an increase of 1.65 yuan. Taikoo refined sugar, BF mark, for contracts closing at the end of March traded at 85.4 yuan, 85.5 yuan, and 86.0 yuan, an increase of 1.5-1.6 yuan. HX mark, for contracts closing at the end of March traded at 80.8 yuan, an increase of 0.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Ribbed Steel Bar Prices Rise and Sales Decline</h3>
<p>Although the market for ribbed steel bars did not appear particularly active yesterday, it was not completely sluggish either. This was because construction companies in Shanghai and various inland river locations had demand, and supply was tight. The amount of stock in Shanghai was limited, leading to concerns about future shortages. As a result, those holding inventory were very bullish, and standard prices soared, rising by 200 yuan compared to the previous market. Yesterday, items such as 3-4 point goods and coarser grades above 5 points were priced at 2,700 yuan per ton. Due to the high prices, actual sales were not as smooth as in the past. In addition, sales of items such as native nails, Bess steel, tinplate, and black iron billets also declined due to high prices. For example, native nails, Bess steel, 155 yuan; Bess steel, 360 yuan; tinplate, 400 yuan (180 pounds) and 450 yuan (200 pounds); black iron billets, 3,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Ample Supply of Dust Coal Spot Goods, Expected to Decline Soon</h3>
<p>Since lump coal prices have risen, dust coal prices have followed suit, with higher grades also increasing by 20-30 yuan. This is due to a shortage of goods on the market, leading to intentional price increases. Yesterday, it was heard that a foreign firm had shipped 6,500 tons of Keelung dust coal, which was being unloaded and stored in warehouses and would soon be sold on the market. Therefore, the supply of spot goods has suddenly become ample, and a decline in prices is expected soon.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Large Slices of Dried Longan Rebound</h3>
<p>Previously, due to a lack of arrivals of large slices of sun-dried longan, the vendors were trying their best to maintain prices. Therefore, while cinnamon longan experienced a decline in price, this item instead rose by 30-40 yuan. Now, more goods have arrived, and because prices are too high, demand is only sporadic. Therefore, vendors have secretly reduced prices by 20-30 yuan, but there are still few buyers.</p>

<h3>Music Education Committee Holds City-Wide Choral Concert, Attended by Over 1,000 People from 20 Units</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airlines News) Since the war, the Ministry of Education has been actively promoting singing with great effort. The previous singing competition and the joint concert of six universities in Chongqing were all results of the Ministry's advocacy. Recently, Minister Chen ordered the Music Education Committee to organize a thousand-person choral concert, with a thousand people each in Chongqing, Shapingba, and Beipei. Unfortunately, due to the short time, preparations could not be completed in time. Therefore, only singers with good training from the five districts of Chongqing, Shaping, Ge, Ci, and Nanquan were selected to concentrate in Chongqing for the concert. Participants totaled 21 units, with over 1,000 people. This scale is unprecedented. However, because this concert involved a large number of participants scattered in all directions, matters such as training, transportation, reception, air defense, sanitation, and the production and selection of sheet music were extremely heavy. The Music Education Committee was only handled by a few people such as Committee Member Li Baozhen, which was very difficult in reality. Therefore, Director Chen Lijang of the Music Education Committee submitted a request to Minister Chen to organize a preparatory committee, appointing Director Wang Xingzhou as the director of the preparatory committee, with Director Chen as the deputy, and Inspector Hao Gengsheng as the secretary-general, with Li Baozhen and others as deputies. The committee was divided into general affairs, arrangement, transportation, performance, publicity, security, and reception groups, led by Liu Xuesong, Hu Ran, Xing Naikang, Duan Tianjiong, Hao Gengsheng, Li Baozhen, Wu Daoyi, Luo Xuelian, Hu Bohan, Yu Daisheng, Ye Yunfeng, and Yu Ruming respectively. After discussions, eleven famous songs were selected, along with two military band ensembles. Minister Chen personally wrote the lyrics for the "Ode to Victory Year" and "Bitter Struggle", which were set to military music and accompanied by Committee Member Jin and Committee Member Li. The captains of the ten major military units in the city were invited to a meeting to select the best instruments and performers from their respective units to form a band of over sixty people, under the training and direction of Committee Member Jin Lusheng. Rehearsals were held at the Sichuan Normal University basketball court. A conductor group was also organized, hiring Wu Bochao, Zheng Zhisheng, Li Baozhen, and Jin Lusheng to conduct the songs. On February 12, the concert was held at the New Transportation Model Area Square in Fuzi Pond. Minister Chen personally attended to deliver a speech and present flags and commemorative medals. Then, all units performed singing. Because the venue had limited capacity, a special line was installed by the Central Broadcasting Station to broadcast at the Shangqingsi Broadcasting Building, Doyou Street Square, Central Park, and Jiudao Dou, allowing the entire city to listen.</p>

<h3>13th West Youth Volleyball Tournament, 20 Men's and Women's Teams Participating, 4 Teams in Group A, 3 Women's Teams, 10 Teams in Group B</h3>
<p>The 13th West Youth Volleyball Tournament, organized by the West Youth Sports Department, has closed its registration, which began on the 13th of this month. Due to the high registration fee (75 yuan registration fee, 15 yuan deposit), participation was not enthusiastic. A total of 20 teams participated, including four teams in Group A: Yinghua, Russian Overseas Chinese, West Youth, and Soviet Society; six teams in the Women's Group: Youxing, Minli, Huxing, West Youth White, West Youth Red, and West Youth Blue; and ten teams in Group B: White Team, Aurora, Giant, and Sokol.

Last year's Group B champion, Leren, did not register. Participating Chinese teams include the White Team and Aurora. The tournament will open on the 31st of this month.

<h3>How to Commemorate the Martyrs?</h3>
<p>--Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Little friends, in just five more days, it will be the anniversary of the Huanghuagang martyrs! (March 29th) I believe that you little friends must have read about the stories of the martyrs who died for their country in books and know them by heart, so there is no need to elaborate here. However, how should we commemorate the martyrs? What are your plans in your little hearts? I would like to offer a few suggestions here.</p>
<p>First, you should collect all the portraits of the martyrs who died for their country from books or magazines, and draw them, either in pencil, ink, or watercolor. You should draw the martyrs, such as Huang Kecheng, vividly and energetically. Under each portrait, in the blank space, write down the martyrs' glorious history.</p>
<p>Second, on the morning of the anniversary, hang up the portraits of the martyrs that you have drawn, and silently remember them for five minutes, and salute them.</p>
<p>Third, older students should gather a small memorial meeting. Brothers, sisters, neighbors, and classmates can all be invited to participate. Whoever can tell the story of the Huanghuagang martyrs well should be elected as the chairman. They should explain in detail how corrupt the Manchu Qing Dynasty was, how the martyrs rose up in rebellion, how they stormed the Guangdong Governor's Office, how they fought bravely and succeeded each other, how the uprising failed, how the martyrs were killed, and why the revolution was necessary.</p>
<p>Fourth, everyone should sing a memorial song together: "Huanghuagang, Huanghua blooms, the flowers bloom year after year, the spirits of the martyrs remain. The immortal spirits illuminate the heavens and the earth, awakening the national soul and bringing joy."</p>
<p>bombing the military bases of other countries, so they are extremely busy. The situation at this time is extremely tense. Moreover, aerial combat requires quick eyes and hands, taking advantage of weaknesses to enter, which is not an easy thing. Therefore, when recruiting old flying pilots, the requirements are very strict, otherwise not only will lives be sacrificed in vain, but the value of an airplane is also very high! When airplanes perform flying stunts in the air, they often do somersaults in the air, but the pilots do not fall out because there are seat belts holding their bodies in place. Moreover, the seat belts are very flexible, and the buckle can be detached with a simple pull, and the belt can be released automatically. The flying suits worn by the pilots have no buttons, but zippers, which are very convenient to wear. If flying high in the clouds, the climate is often below zero degrees, at which time the clothes can be energized to keep the body warm. If something happens to the airplane, if it is absolutely necessary, the pilot can escape by jumping out of the airplane with a parachute. There are two forms of parachute: one is the backpack type, which is carried on the back, and the other is the seat type, which is placed under the buttocks. When the pilot jumps out of the airplane, they must finish reciting the three words "one, two, three" before pulling the parachute cord, so that the parachute can start to open. If the three words are not finished and the cord is pulled too early, the parachute will often get caught on the wing of the airplane, which is very dangerous. It is decided that Russia was the first to use paratroopers in the European war. The paratroopers were transported by airplane, carrying guns and cannons, and parachuting to the ground to fight. This tactic is very suitable for our country's old saying of "flying generals descending from the sky." Father Ah Hui stopped talking at this point, because he had finished everything he wanted to say!</p>
<h3>Tadpole</h3>
<p>— Jin Xianfa</p>
<p>The next day, Ming went to the garden. He saw that the lawn was covered with new green, and the trees were full of pink peach blossoms. The wildflowers in the flowerbeds were vying for beauty in red and white. Moreover, swallows were soaring in the sky, and butterflies were dancing in the flower paths. He thought to himself: This is spring coming to the world! The spring breeze blew warmly, the spring sun shone on his innocent face, and he smiled happily.</p>
<p>Walking to the pond, he suddenly saw many black tadpoles swimming around in the green water. He squatted by the pond, puffed out his small hands, and wanted to catch them, shouting: "Brother, hurry up and get the net! There are many fun little fish here."</p>
<p>Qi'er was reading a book in the house when he heard his younger brother's shout. He came out and asked, "Brother, what are you shouting about? Why are you making such a fuss?"</p>
<p>"Brother, hurry up and get the net to catch them, they're going to escape!" Ming'er still shouted, lying on the ground with his right hand immersed in the water.</p>
<p>"Don't mess around, brother, get up!" Qi'er hurried over to help his younger brother up, and said, "These are tadpoles, let's not catch them."</p>
<p>"What are tadpoles?"</p>
<p>"Tadpoles are the larvae of frogs. They live in the water for more than ten days and then turn into frogs. Frogs are very beneficial to farmland. They love to eat pests, which helps the rice in our fields grow quickly."</p>
<p>Qi'er took his younger brother's hand and sat on a large stone under the willow tree, and continued, "If you catch tadpoles and keep them in a bottle, they will die overnight. Then you are killing many frogs. Without frogs, there will be more pests in the fields. They will eat up the rice, and the farmers won't be able to harvest anything. Without rice, we won't have food to eat and will starve to death. Yesterday when we went to school, didn't we see many poor people starving to death on the road? That's because the rice merchants are so ruthless. They refuse to sell the rice stored in their warehouses at a cheap price..."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Ming'er suddenly realized his mistake. He said, "I won't catch tadpoles anymore."</p>
<p>"That's right, brother. In another half month, we will be able to hear the sounds of many frogs singing in our pond like drumming. Do you like to listen?"</p>
<p>"I love to listen," Ming'er clapped his hands and jumped up. At this moment, a butterfly flew in front of him, and the beautiful flying insect, like one wearing colorful clothes, made him stare in admiration for a long time.</p>
<p>Qi'er also told his younger brother that to prevent the tadpoles kept in the bottle from dying, he could spread fine sand at the bottom of the bottle and put some aquatic plants in it. However, it would take a very long time for the tadpoles in the bottle to turn into frogs, and they would die after they transformed. Of course, tadpoles love freedom, and the nutrients in the bottle cannot be as rich as those in the pond.</p>
<p>It was time for a nap, so they walked along several winding garden paths and returned to the house. In the garden, another burst of clear and melodious warbling drifted by.</p>
<h3>Kang Yuan Toy Essay Contest Second Prize for Children: My Favorite Kang Yuan Toy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhijie</p>
<p>My favorite Kang Yuan toy is the firing tank. Its gray coat, overlapping rubber wheels, and short, stout body always move with a solemn gait when it turns.</p>
<p>When I'm hungry, the more I look at it, the more it seems like an incarnation of my dad. Aren't Dad's eyes just like the tank's firing tubes, often shooting out handsome and lovely sparks? Dad's steady and dignified movements are even more like a slowly moving tank. I love Dad, so I also deeply love my little tank.</p>
<p>However, whenever I open my eyes wide, hug Dad's face, and tell him my childish imagination, Dad always smiles and shakes his head, saying: "Yijie's words are all right. From the outside, Dad really looks like a tank, and Dad even hopes that Yijie will grow up to be as brave and fearless as a tank when doing things. But, does Yijie know? Tanks, like tigers, can eat people! Countless loyal and patriotic soldiers have sacrificed under the firing tubes of tanks, and even more beautiful fields have been crushed to pieces by the giant wheels of tanks. Dad doesn't want to have the heart of a tank, and Dad deeply hates the ferocity of tanks."</p>
<p>So, my bright eyes began to darken. I stared blankly at the monster squirming on the table, lost in thought. Suddenly, I regained my liveliness and innocence, and happily said to Dad: "This is not the tank I love. The giant wheels of the tank I love only flatten the unfair roads in the world, and its majestic gun muzzles will only ever target violent people."</p>
<h3>What Kind of New Toys Do I Hope Kang Yuan Factory Will Make?</h3>
<p>One day, I said to my dad: "The toys produced by Kang Yuan Factory are of many kinds, all really cute, truly a treasure for us children. However, I hope that Kang Yuan Factory will produce toys that do not lose the fun of toys but are also practical. Like the rocking horses that our school provides for children to ride, if they were shrunk down and made into toys, then as long as the spring is wound, the rocking horse would really rock as if there were children sitting on it, how fun! And, isn't the bottom of the rocking horse just like Dad's ink blotter? As long as you wrap it with a piece of blotting paper, it can be used for Yijie to blot ink." Dad listened and nodded in agreement.</p>
<h3>About Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>Last Sunday, Ah Hui's father talked a lot about airplanes. Just as he was getting into his talk and Ah Hui was listening attentively, he was suddenly interrupted by his mother. So, on this Sunday morning, Ah Hui asked his father to continue talking.</p>
<p>His father said to him, "Where did I get to last time? I forgot. Can you tell me?" The father was secretly testing Ah Hui's memory and even more so, he wanted to test whether he could completely "digest" and remember what he had said last time?</p>
<p>"Dad, last time you talked about how airplanes rise, how the machine guns on airplanes shoot, how bombs are dropped? Finally, you talked about why airplanes are arranged in triangles or chevrons? You've already talked about these, right?" Ah Hui recited such a long passage fluently.</p>
<p>"Good! That's right. I'll tell you a little more: Isn't it great to watch airplanes fighting each other? But the pilot's life is hanging by a thread at this time, because an ordinary fighter plane only has one or two pilots. During combat, they have to manage the machinery, shoot at other countries' airplanes with machine guns, and sometimes drop bombs."</p>

<h3>Reunited with Xun Huisheng</h3>
<p>— Jing Ying</p>
<p>It had been several years since I had seen Xun Huisheng. Last year, there were rumors that he was coming south, but it didn't happen because he was busy opening his own Liuxiang Restaurant. This time, the check was finally cashed. He led Wang Wenyuan, Jiang Shaoqing, He Wenqian, Cao Lianxiao, Chen Xixing, Xu Hecai, He Shengqing, Zhu Binxian, and Wang Duoshou in a performance at the Golden Theater. Although the ticket price was as high as seven yuan, eight or nine out of ten seats were already booked in advance, even before the repertoire was set. Last night (the 21st) was the first day of the performance. The program was "The Complete Hongxi Celebration". Wang Wenyuan performed "Dingjun Mountain" in the first act, and Furongcao He Wenqian performed "Fanjiang Pass". I booked a seat a day in advance and rushed to the Golden Theater after dinner. By the time I got there, "Fanjiang Pass" had already been performing the sister-in-law scene. The so-called He Wenqian turned out to be He Peihua. Furongcao was listed first on the playbill, but He Peihua played the lead role of Xue Jinlian in the performance. Perhaps Furongcao was deliberately supporting her. Both of them were very good. The finale was "Dingjun Mountain". Wang Wenyuan as Huang Zhong, his singing style followed the Yu school, without losing the rules. Jiang Shaoqing as Xiahou Yuan and Cao Lianxiao as Yan Yan were also very competent. After the intermission, "Hongxi Celebration" was performed. Yu Hecai as Mo Ji had a very good voice, but his figure was a bit short. Zhu Binxian as Jin Song was also not annoying. Chen Xi and Lin Run, and Wang Duoshou as the messenger of good news, were steady. Xun Huisheng's Jin Yunü, although fat, actually stepped on the middle stilts, and they were hard stilts. The first two scenes depicting the movements and demeanor of a little girl were perfect. In the "Getting on the Boat" and "Banquet" scenes, the facial expressions were very good. Among the singing segments, the erliu was the best. Although his voice was not as soft as before, it was still smooth. His mouth and eyes were still very expressive. Because of the curfew, many lines were cut from the "Beating with a Stick" scene. After the play ended, it was already 11:35 PM.</p>
<h3>Ginger Rogers Also Wants to Strike</h3>
<p>— Hu Fanfang</p>
<p>Ann Sheridan's demand for a raise of $1,500 per week is still deadlocked with Warner Bros. Now, according to reliable sources, Ginger Rogers, due to the unprecedented success of "Kitty Foyle", is also dissatisfied with the $150,000 she receives per film. RKO, which relies heavily on her, has reportedly relented and will increase her pay starting with her next film. At the same time, Marlene Dietrich has also reportedly made a request to Universal Pictures, but her condition is not a raise, but to be able to choose a money-making male star to co-star with her, because in the past, such as in "The Garden of Allah", the male lead was not very appealing.</p>
<p>Bao Ping's New Work</p>
<p>Following "Spring Returns to Earth", the next film is "Nice Girl". "Nice Girl" has now been completed, and her next film is scheduled to be with Charles Boyer, titled "Ready For Romance". Because Boyer is not very tall, Bao Ping does not have to stand on tiptoe when kissing him. After Bao Ping wears high heels, the two are both five feet six inches tall.</p>
<p>Garbo Sets Her Sights on Spencer Tracy</p>
<p>Garbo told people that the reason she hasn't acted in a long time is because of Spencer Tracy. Because she insisted that Spencer be the male lead in her films. But the studio has so far lacked a script that suits both of their personalities. At the same time, Spencer is putting all his energy into a film similar to "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde". The female lead is intended for Carole Lombard and Ginger Rogers, but they declined due to ranking issues. It is said that Ingrid Bergman, who starred in "Intermezzo", has been invited to play the role.</p>
<p>Lamour Refuses to Film Nude Scene</p>
<p>Dorothy Lamour was originally scheduled to have a nude scene in her new film "The Road to Zanzibar", but after Lamour saw the script, she suddenly refused to film it. The studio had no choice but to do it perfunctorily. (Editor's note: Lamour's determination to abandon the "sarong" is using this film as a touchstone.)</p>
<h3>Four Stars Shine</h3>
<p>It is said that there is no film in the Silver Kingdom that can match the strong lineup of "Gunga Din". Clark Gable's great lover has set up a love net everywhere. Spencer Tracy's heroic friend is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of a lover. Claudette Colbert's virtuous wife thinks of leaving, but ultimately returns to her husband's embrace for the sake of love. Hedy Lamarr's beauty unleashes inner bewitchment, almost tearing apart a struggling couple. The entire film is set against the backdrop of oil fields, vividly depicting the men's view of money at the time, not taking money to heart at all. Becoming rich overnight and becoming poor tomorrow are extremely common things. In this situation, men and women all hold the concept of "eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die", which is similar to the situation on "isolated islands" today. In a harsh environment, it depicts how a pair of heroic friends are loyal and how they reunite, which is such an encouraging medicine for the world. (Photo: Hedy Lamarr is absent, so it becomes a three-player game.)</p>
<h3>Blood Rain, Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Reminiscent of Lord Pingyuan</p>
<p>Chen Fei's heart was stirred when he heard that Zhang Cangqiu had joined the army. So he told Zhang Cangqiu that he was originally from Pei County, Xuzhou, and had always helped in the镖局 [security escort service]. Later, because something went wrong while escorting goods to Shanxi, he had no face to return to the镖局 [security escort service] and wandered around, eventually ending up here. He had been eating and drinking at this estate for a long time, and felt very ashamed, so he volunteered to join the army and asked Zhang Cangqiu to take him along. Zhang Cangqiu saw that he spoke sincerely and readily agreed. Li Xin smiled, "Chen Zhuangshi [strong man] also wants to go to the border to serve in the army? Then I am very much in favor of it and dare not keep you any longer." Chen Fei said, "I am very grateful for Lord Li's hospitality here. I think that if a person does not go out and do something when he is young, wouldn't he be burying his life? I happened to have this opportunity, so I decided to follow you." Zhang Cangqiu said, "Then please prepare immediately, I will leave today." Li Xin said, "Why is Zhang Zhuangshi [strong man] in such a hurry? We have just met for the first time, we should get together for a while. Why don't you stay here for a few days and then leave?" Zhang Cangqiu saw that Li Xin was so fond of talented people and so affectionate, so he nodded and said, "You are truly the Lord Pingyuan of today! Our meeting can be said to be a rare thing. I will stay one more day and chat with you, but I must leave tomorrow no matter what." Li Xin saw that he said this and did not want to force him to stay any longer, so he ordered his servants to set up a wine feast, and everyone sat down as guests and hosts and feasted in the hall. Zhang Cangqiu had a very good capacity for alcohol, holding up large cups and drinking wildly like a whale. Halfway through the drinking, Li Xin said to Zhang Cangqiu and others, "Today we are gathered here, and tomorrow the two Zhuangshi [strong men] will be far away. Our meeting is accidental, and it is very memorable and rare. After this parting, I don't know when we will meet again. I feel that our intentions are very compatible, so I have a request to the three of you, which is to learn from the story of Liu, Guan, and Zhang swearing brotherhood in the peach garden in the Three Kingdoms, and become sworn brothers. If you don't despise me, then we will make a sworn pact." Zhang Cangqiu laughed first and said, "I am a martial artist, and you two are princes and nobles. If you want to become sworn brothers, wouldn't it be an insult to you two?" Xu Jing smiled and said, "You are a straightforward person, don't say that. If you agree, it would be an honor. Now, whoever agrees with what Lord Li said can each drink a cup as a sign, so as not to be polite to each other." After he said that, he drank the cup of wine in front of him first. (19)</p>
