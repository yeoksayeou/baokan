<h3>紀念威爾遜誕辰羅斯福發表演說　民治主義終必獲得勝利　美將不惜再度為此作戰</h3>
<p>斯唐登　羅斯福總統昨日預言民治國之絕對勝利，乃侵略者之覆沒，因「此類動輒玩弄刀劍之人，終必死於刀劍之下也，」羅斯福此項演說，係在美國上次大戰總統威爾遜於一八五六年十二月二十八日誕生之舊寓發表者，該住宅已作為威爾遜之紀念祠，當總統演說時，在塲者尙有多名人多人，如國務卿赫爾與英國駐美大使哈里法克斯勛爵等，羅斯福總統曾於週杪訪問兩美國故總統之舊居，除威爾遜總統之舊居所，羅斯福總統並於星期六訪問故總統門羅之「灰塲」（即門羅總統之舊里），美國現時之「門羅主義」，即為門羅總統所提倡者，羅斯福總統現時所秉行之國策，即此二故總統之遺訓為依歸，羅斯福總統昨日之演說云，「吾人今日聚會瞻仰」自由之新紀念祠，吾人藉此舉動，表明吾人之眞正信念，此簡單之信念為何，即自由與民治是也，吾人前曾為此信念作戰，吾人將永遠準備為此信念再度作戰，余以為君儕美人重行宣誓對民治之信念，最適當之地點，無過於威爾遜總統之誕生地，羅斯福總統繼縱論威氏一生，又云「際茲世界今日發生悲慘的衝突，並威脅及於吾儕自由人民所愛之一切，過去歷史紀載，證明人類之之甄正進步，厥在能眞實了解精神上之價值，動輒仰仗刀劍以解決一切之輩，終亦必死於刀劍，」總統又言「肉體上之力量不能長此抵抗精神上之力量，威爾孫衣衫襤褸　一生事跡，實為精神克服暴力之勝利，在渠領導之下，吾國曾有長足之精神進步，關於威爾遜氏，余能作下列之言論，世界方被物質上思維，貪得無饜，得寸望尺，及報仇等等勢力所統治之際，渠獨能得見燦爛之境界，自私之人，崇信武力，不能同情渠解放世界之理想，渠將能被認為一永生之政治家，世人方尋求報復及物質上之誅求，彼獨設法使亞放之時日接近並以自由代替世界上之暴力，威氏此宅之將為吾人長此保留，實為美國之逸話，在此流域中，浮琴尼亞省將為美國保持佐證，使人知威氏之自由見解，以支維持世界之民治主義，渠曾敎訓吾人，民治主義不能在孤立中求存，吾人對渠之判斷及信念，至為心折」云，（五日合眾社電）　　柏林　權威德人士頃評論羅總統在斯陶頓之演說，（按羅總統於演說中，曾預料民國必勝侵略者必敗），謂此次演說，僅屬美國之事，與歐洲無涉，又稱「自威爾遜以至羅斯福間一段歷史的疑問，吾人將任歷史答覆之，使前總統威爾孫家成為一神龕（按即崇拜威爾遜之意），於歐洲毫無影響」，（五日合眾社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>近東戰局之前途</h3>
<p>中國，日本，菲列賓與越南等等，這些亞細亞洲東部，接近太平洋的部分，人們習慣統稱之爲遠東；與遠東對稱的，如土耳其，叙里亞，伊拉克，伊朗與阿剌伯等等，在亞細亞洲西部，接近地中海的部分，人們習慣統稱之爲近東，（亦稱中東，則以巴爾幹半島爲近東）。總之，遠東與近東，皆沒有明確範圍，祇是以歐洲爲本位，在歐洲人的心目中，視之爲東，分之爲遠與近；遠東的人，甚至比遠東更東的人、人云亦云，遂相習而稱這是遠東，那是近東。姑不體眛其名其實的通或不通，其爲歐洲文化的潛勢力之徵候，自無疑義。現在，歐戰擴展到近東了。由歐戰的擴展至近東，很可能的由遠東蔓延而形成世界大戰。</p>
<p>近東戰事舞台上的兩角色，一是英軍，一是伊拉克；開火於四天之前，即五月二日。到現在爲止，消息紛雜矛盾，不知誰先啓其釁。誰先誰後，問題的焦點不關責任，要在軍略。申言之，從世界大局着想，髯願英國方面以軍略關係，具有把握，處於主動地位，而在這一隅，在這一次，能夠爭着先鞭，及早解決。當然，我們不以爲伊拉克合該在英國控制之下，蓋每一國族的爭取獨立自由，我們應予同情，伊拉克的對英反感，自是情理中事；但投靠更强更暴的覇主，釀成革命性的政變，攘奪了政權，不辭爲新主人的鷹犬爪牙，則未許以爭取獨立自由的旗幟爲掩護了。我們亦不以爲這次假定是英軍先發制人，而在伊拉克是突遭外侮，猝不及備；蓋在世局動盪之中，英德鬥爭之際、伊國政權自親英派一轉變而落入親德者之手，這是四月上旬的事；伊國親德政府不會相信英國方面情甘屈讓，嘿爾而息，時經匝月，而對英絕無戒備。因此之故，英伊開火假定發動於伊方，則我們不能不想像英伊戰事前途之嚴重性。</p>
<p>伊拉克的文化與工業，皆甚落後；人口僅三百餘萬，比上海一埠猶有不如；政治內情，夙稱腐敗而複雜；作戰力量貧且弱，絕非英國對手；假定近東戰事祗此目前的兩角色，則範圍窄，規模小，英國得以戡亂的精神，短時期內使之平定，而奠定比較往時更强健的控制基礎。塞翁失馬，安知非福。然而不論事實如何，豈可若此輕率的樂觀。以宗教的，種族的，恩怨的種種微妙關係，環繞於伊拉克四周之土耳其，伊期，阿拉伯，叙里亞等邦國，對這兩角色交手的反應如何？以政治的，經濟的，軍事的種種策略關係，彼伊拉克的隔鄰蘇聯，對於這一變化的態度如何？這些尙未判明的反應與態度，皆得直接間接影響及於英伊戰事與近東局勢。至於德國，對於伊拉克，除天空之外，並無直接的通路；而昨日柏林消息猶稱德國對此英伊交綏，採取保留態；亦即伊拉克雖與英國對抗，而德國並不派遣軍隊，以「與英國在此處相値，而予以打擊」。然德國空車飛越叙里亞而向伊拉克進發的電訊，旣有所傳；而伊拉克政變之納粹實居幕後操縱，尤爲公開秘密；且希特勒一面覬覦伊國油產，一面規畫粉碎英國；在北非洲德義聯軍進攻埃及以爲德國截斷蘇彝士運河戰略的右翼，則伊拉克方面自是脅迫蘇彝士的左翼。於是言之，英伊之間，倘若是偶然的衝突，或是英方軍略的發動，則已；不然，伊國戰英而是希特勒軍略的一部分之及時發動，則世人應予莫大注意了。</p>
<p>假定這是希特勒軍略的一部分之及時發動，是可相一像近東戰事範圍將不限於伊拉克；軍事的牽涉阿剌伯，政治外交的乃至軍事的牽動蘇聯與十耳其，皆成題中應有之義了。不僅如此，英國在蘇彝士運河兩岸的任何一據點發生動搖之時，乃爲今日以後日本發動其武力南進的第一機會。而日本在緊跟着簽訂蘇日中立條約之後，近日忽對美國表示其形形色色的姿態；這是日本在萬無辦法之中，對美尙未完全放棄其萬一獲得妥協的迷夢，亦是日本在又一冒險之前，對美試其最後的麻醉，施其最後的煙慕。爾後發展，將　近東戰局息息相關。</p>

<h3>希特勒　演說全文</h3>
<p>（續昨）希特勒繼稱、余之和平建議、被視爲恐懼與膽怯之徵象、歐洲及美國之煽動戰爭者、均藉以愚弄民衆、余警吿勿以夜間轟炸機襲擊平民、亦被視爲德國荏弱之徵象、一般人以爲、德國空軍之自制態度、爲德機不能於夜間飛行之明證、邱吉爾允許英國報紙向民衆宣傳　唯有英國空軍能採用此項空戰方式、英國空軍之猛烈轟炸德國平民及英國之封鎖措置、爲强迫德國民衆屈服之方法、余屢次提出關於此項問題之警吿、達三個月之久、而此項警吿、並未使邱吉爾發生印象、余亦不感驚異、渠固何愛於他人之生命乎、渠尙關懷文化與文化建設乎、邱吉爾於歐戰爆發時、巳申述渠希望戰爭、雖英國若于城市、將化爲灰燼、亦所不惜、目前邱吉爾巳如願以償矣、余曾申明、敵人投彈一枚、吾人將以百枚報之、而此項警告、未能使邱吉爾考慮渠所採行動之後果、　聲言此項警吿、不能使渠困惱、並向英國民衆保證、渠視察德機轟炸之城市後、殘垣頹壁之景象、使渠充溢歡娛之情緒、而於返回倫敦時、益感勇氣百倍矣、邱吉爾或即藉此增强其繼續此項作戰方式之決心、然吾人亦決心報復英國之炸彈、待英國民衆去除邱吉爾而後巳、由於邱吉爾之反常態度、英國決定使巴爾幹變爲戰塲、渠彷彿瘋人、在歐洲尋覓可以燃火之物、歷五年之久、而被收買者、復開門延入、殊屬遺憾、德軍於法國戰役中、獲得法國秘密文件、發現法國於一九三九年與一九四〇年之間、已企圖使巴爾幹變爲戰塲、動昌軍隊數百師、協助英國、雖法國之崩潰、致此項計劃未能實現、然邱吉爾從未放棄此項計劃、但羅馬尼亞參加三國公約後、邱吉爾益感此項計劃之難於實現矣、</p>
<p>巴爾幹政策</p>
<p>希特勒於是申述德國之巴爾幹政策、（一）德國在巴爾幹並無領土或政治之利益、對於各國因自私而發生之領土問題及內政問題、均不感興趣、（二）德國將竭力增進對巴爾幹國家之經濟關係、此項發現、不僅利於德國、對於關係各國、亦有裨益、因德國爲工業國、需要糧食與原料、巴爾幹國家、均有農產品與原料、而需要工業品、倘英美人士以爲此項政策、即係德國勢力侵入巴爾幹之徵象、殊屬憑笨、各國均應依據民族利益、確定經濟政策、而不能依據猶太人及民主國家之資本家之利益、爲經濟政策之標準、（三）德國希望互相通商之國家、保持健全與强盛之狀態、德國竭力協助各國、鞏固國內之秩序、而不關心　特殊之政制、巴爾幹各國、由於以上各項措置、不唯日益繁榮、且巳踏入互相信任之途徑、然邱吉爾亦竭力阻撓此項和平發展、英國對巴爾幹各國之保證、運用半分不値之援助諾　、使和平之東南歐、發生不安定與缺乏信心之因素、希臘固無需此項保證、然因英國之誘惑、遂與賄賂王室之牽綫者共患難、余以爲應區別希臘之腐化領袖與希臘之民　、希臘之領導階級、受由英國束轉之國王所煽動、重視英國之政策、而輕視希臘之目標、殊屬遺憾、余常讚美希臘之文化、而目覩此項發展、竟愛莫能助、允感痛苦、邱吉爾於去年夏季、巳實行其保證與諾言、使希臘屢次破壞其中立地位、義國所受影響允鉅、不得不於去年十月間、向希臘政府提出建議、要求保證中止此項不可容忍之情况、然希臘政府由於英國之壓力、斷然拒絕此項要求、而巴爾幹之和平、亦不可保矣、</p>
<p>德進攻計劃</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談　（五）（一）</h3>
<p>德國的準備全面戰</p>
<p>全　戰爭是以詳密的策劃，突然的襲學，集中全力三個觀念爲基礎。其主要戰略厥在採取一種單純的攻擊，每一動作之後緊接着另一動作，這種「以戰養戰」的策略，原爲拿破崙所慣用，希特勒却推陳出新，專門利用避實擊虛」的戰術。</p>
<p>從前的軍事學主張「擒賊先擒王」，以爲敵軍主力被擊潰之後，其餘部隊即隨之瓦解，如其捨本逐末地去攻擊弱點，徒然消耗實力，根本上不足以解決戰局。這種理論，對於從前局部戰爭，固然適用，但對於全面戰爭，就變爲陳腐了。</p>
<p>舉例來說，在上次歐戰時，協約軍倘若採取新戰略，那麼在德軍假道比利時進攻時，就當假道丹麥進攻德國，同時由俄軍在波羅的海方面實行夾擊。後來要採取這種戰略已經太遲了。</p>
<p>極權國的征略戰，除開極少數的例外（如一九四二年二月，蘇聯算錯了芬蘭的實力，正面攻　維堡一役）都是千篇一律的。他們都是預先佈置一連串的遠大計劃，然後待機而動，每個軍事行動都在民洽國輿論達到沸點之時結束。他們直接進攻的目標是如此脆弱，毫無防備，甚至一望而知是偏僻的處所；從軍事上說，民治國必須發動大規模攻勢，去奪回一個小小的前哨站，從政治上說，必須長期苦戰，去改變一個旣成事實。</p>
<p>至於德國對法國進行新式的全面戰爭，實際上在七年前德國國會付之一炬的日子起，即已發動了，那時希特勒領導全黨，口口聲聲反對「猶太的馬克斯主義者」及「凡爾賽和約，」而視法國爲兩者的奴僕</p>
<p>全面戰的發軔可以視爲國社黨與德國陸軍結合後的產物。德國軍官，世代相傳，以軍役爲顯耀。他們平素無時無刻不在想打仗的念頭。相傳舒利芬上將某次偕夫人游山，興賞落日美景。他的夫人讚嘆迫，「多麼美麗的景緻呀！」</p>
<p>「這些山不足躱避砲火，這條溪流也不能作爲阻碍物，在軍事上毫無價値，」舒利芬這樣的回答說。</p>
<p>德國陸軍素來不干與政治，偶而參加也不過逢塲作戲。他們一心一意只知如何實行政府所決定的大計。德國政府倘在一九三三年時，實行共產，那麼陸軍早已擯斥國社主義而向法西斯的義大利討伐了。</p>
<p>德國參謀部是陸軍的靈魂，平時也和各國參謀部一樣，無時不在草擬各種軍事計劃，準備應付各種可能的戰爭。參謀人材是從現役軍人中選拔，且多從校級以下軍官中選拔。德國陸軍這樣的培植新人材，實非他國所及。</p>
<p>軍官訓練班召集之後，分爲兩組，各由高級參謀官一員領導。一組代表本國參謀部，另一組代表敵國參謀部，分別研究軍事。如在硏究對法作戰，則他們就分爲德軍和法軍兩組。雙方都有關於兩國兵力的各種情報，德方的兵力則以各種紀錄爲根據，法方的兵力，則以大使館陸軍參贊的情報，間諜的密報，以及外國報紙的紀載爲根據。</p>
<p>這些報吿備極詳盡，諸凡作戰帥團的數目，每師的　額與所備　關槍數目，駐紮地點，編制內容，士氣，軍紀和戰鬥力，無不應有盡有，與戰時所需的報吿一般無二。</p>
<p>如上次歐戰中，美國第一批軍隊若干師開到西錢時，德國參謀部的紀錄上就說，這是善於防禦戰的勁旅，但往往會輕率前進，德軍須以有力部隊，深藏戰壕及機關槍陣地之後，待機迎擊。</p>
<p>德國參謀部對於各國將領，都有特種紀錄，說明他們的獨有性格。他們對於各國後備師團，動員地點，開拔的鐵路網，軍需的來源等等，也都有群細的報吿。</p>
<p>這兩組德法假想參謀部就根據道些報吿，策劃進攻方略。研究完畢。</p>
<p>這班受訓練的軍官，就紛紛歸隊，另外召集第二班，繼續硏究。</p>
<p>德國原是軍事學的發祥地，各專家對於馬奇諾防錢的重要作用，早就胸有成竹，這點對於德國初期作戰計劃，頗有影饗。德國參謀部早已知道馬奇諾防綫築成以後，法國的作戰計劃已被完全推翻，德軍開入魯爾，武　萊因及兼併奧地利，法國決不會反抗。及至德軍進攻捷克，參謀部雖不能保證法軍不出而反攻，可是反攻未必有利，囚爲德國的齊格菲防綫已及時完成十分之　了。</p>
<p>防禦戰在德軍心目中，除爲局部的　攻擊戰正在別處進行時應用外，差不多是虛偽的理論。因此他們對於大多數軍事防禦物，也都認做虛僞的，只有對於英國，須由海軍決定勝負，是例外而已。</p>
<p>總而言之，德國參謀部對於任何一方面的戰爭，無不刪繁就簡的作成具體方略，這種方略眞可謂「錦囊妙計」，一聞信號，立即可以　諸實施。相傳毛奇將軍在睡夢中被普法開戰的報吿驚醒之後，不慌不忙的吩咐左右說：「開啟那邊橱裹第三個抽屜，裏面藏着一個小封袋，上面標着「作戰計劃第七號」字樣，照此行事。」說完之後，他機續安睡去了。</p>
<p>希特勒在這次歐戰中，在波蘭，在挪威，在西綫以至在巴爾幹，到處用兵，攻無不克，也完全得力於參謀部的「錦囊妙計」。</p>

<h3>港滬兩地米糧運輸　已宣布聯合統制　下月起港政府有專營權　運滬米糧全數交工部局　米價昨始見跌風諒可再跌二十元</h3>
<p>昨日盛傳、公共租界工部局曁法租界公董局、為穩定滬市民食起見、除已採取同一步驟、分別向海外產米區訂購大宗廉價洋米運滬調劑外、茲為貫澈初衷起見、將於本月十日起、限制兩租界內食米價格、即每石以一百十元為最高價、不得故意遞增、否則購糶市民、可向當局檢舉、俾依法究辦、顧該項消息、兩租界當局尙未發表正式公報、</p>
<p>法公董局採辦計劃</p>
<p>法租界公董局為欲使外界明悉該局對於籌劃民食進行一般情形起見、特於昨日下午四時、在霞飛路該局督辦間招待本埠華文報及通訊社新聞記者、即席由該局督辦訂鴣氏發表關於糧食問題云、本局前為嚴格管理米市起見、曾經採取適當步驟、由本局發起組織食糧管理委員會、迄已八閱月、與公共租界食糧管委會頗多合作、惟目前民食恐慌愈甚、本局甫在計劃、擬向越南等地採辦大宗洋米運滬、屆時將低價出售、顧船隻及水脚尙待續商、現本局以全力注視此一問題、俾得早日實現、</p>
<p>怡和太古負責運米</p>
<p>公共租界工部局所採辦之廉小絞米、首批可於本月初旬左右運抵此間、嗣後將分別抵達、對於輸運一節、頃已由工部局向太古怡和兩航輪公司洽就、該兩航輪公司嗣復將負完全責任、裝載該項廉價港米、關於各種手續、亦經當局委由立基等兩洋行全權辦理、據向立基洋行探悉、（一）本市雜糧行數家、昨已向該洋行簽訂仰光米一萬餘包之承銷契約、按工部局於決定此一運米計劃時、曾勸諭雜糧業米行業前往訂購、但被拒絕、現因確知工部局所訂購之米、將於本月十五日左右到滬銷售、若不早日訂購、則併此合法之利潤亦不可得、乃不得不改變態度、（二）本市各米號連日紛紛接洽承銷者、總數亦約有萬餘包、惟多數係小米號、大米號尙存觀望、蓋彼等所囤甚多、一時無法傾銷、（三）本市各　戶連日亦紛紛有向該洋行訂購者、但該行為顧全合法米行米號營業計、婉請居戶向各米號定購、為價格重量與成份與當局規定者如有不符時、則可由該洋行派員調查、（四）此項港米、係屬四十支小絞米、即與目下市上所售每石一百四十元之質地一般無二、絕非如外間所傳謂係小絞碎尖、</p>
<p>昨日米價始見跌風</p>
<p>昨晨米市塲開做後、仍照原議辦法交易、秩序雖騷雜無緒、惟人心頗極疲軟、各檔米價初市即趨下游、囤貨者咸將大宗食米紛紛抑價求脫、而米號納胃甚疲、市塲情形較前迥異、結果米價卒較前市下落四元一石左右、昨晨市塲曾一度猛跌九元以上、此乃三月餘來之第一次大跌、負責人士聲稱、今晨米價跌落後、預米不久更將劇跌、米價今晨趨跌後、諒將再跌二十元、法當局所辦第一批越米、諒可於兩週內抵滬、</p>
<h3>昨日五節　全市懸旗慶祝　各界效法國父革命人格　遵循國策解救國家危難</h3>
<p>昨日「五五」節、國父孫中山先生就任非常大總統革命政府成立紀念日、本市各界依照各公團與租界當局洽定辦法、一律懸旗慶祝、情殊熱烈、當民國十年、國勢阽危、內則軍閥披猖、外則列強突窺伺、岌岌不可終日、國父不顧環境險阻、毅然於五月五日就任非常大道聽途說職、繼續肩負革命大業、是為革命政府成立、各界以國父彼時毅然就任非常大總統、不妥協、不畏難、實為日後誓師北伐、底定全國之肇基、丁此國難、正舉國奮鬥之時、各界決效法國父革命人格、不辭任何艱難困苦、努力邁進、以解救國家危難、完成民族復興、</p>
<h3>煤球麵粉售價　仍被囤戶把持　煤商投機尙在企圖抬價　麵粉價擯持麵點均漲價</h3>
<p>自米煤球兩項、一再漲價後、市民食用、需費激增、現在米一問題、已由工部局及公董局統盤籌劃、港米即可到埠派銷、情況遂見轉捩、惟燃料一項、仍被囤戶等掯不放鬆、即如某煤球廠、即有棧單二千噸、無法收回、煤價因此遽雜平抑、且聞煤業方面、有一部分密議白煤將</p>
<p>每噸加價　四十元、煤球每擔十八元之說、祇因外匯放長、暫未實行、此則當局宜加注意、預先壓制、毋令成為事實、又麵粉售價、亦受囤戶影響、昨雖證明美粉廿萬包運滬、而價僅跌二元左右、足見囤粉並未放手、以致各項麵食、仍在漲價趨勢中、貧民充飢之唯一</p>
<p>經濟物品　（大餅油條）自三分漲至五分後、中間雖曾因粉價增加而縮小、惟仍售原價、茲則亦以其他物價之影響、故由同業公會通告、昨日起改售每件一角、（惟多數並未實行）他如湯　已自三分改為五分、碗麵遞漲百分之五十至一百不等、稀飯自五分售八分、粢飯糕五分改一角、豆槳五分改七分、飯館碗飯各漲百分之五十、所有吃食物品、實已無物不漲、慕爾堂平售白飯、昨起亦再度增加售價五分為每斤三角、</p>
<p>正式宣佈聯合統制</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報載同盟社四日香港電云、香港政府昨正式宣布、自六月一日起、對於一切米糧之輸出入、有專營權、關於專營計劃之公報稱、過去數月來、香港與上海之米況、未可滿意、投機活動猖獗、米蠧貪慾無饜、未能加以充分之統制、唯兩地當局之聯合統制、始能盡可能範圍、防目消耗米糧者續受剝削、事已顯見、香港政府與上海公共租界工部局、為達此目的起見、爰乃商定辦法、規定運往上海公共租界之米糧、應專交工部局、故該局今將直接運入此等米糧、分發零售商、因本港米價奇昂、而將來米糧供給不定、且船隻日少、故香港政府擬於五月三十一日現行領照運米入境期滿後、專營一切米糧之輸出入、專營僅係戰時辦法、但戰爭結束後、或有繼續實行若干時日之必要、去幾泰國米收較少、而從他方定期獲取米糧、殊未可定、故本港所耗及運出之米糧、必須多多取給於緬甸方面、</p>
<h3>春繭無法開秤　絲廠拆車停繅　若干絲廠改為他種工廠　江浙春繭悉遭日商統制</h3>
<p>江浙春繭即將開始上市、因華中蠶絲公司統制、阻止絲繭廠商設行收購、上海公共租界各絲廠因原料告罄、被迫停車、而收繭計劃、因日商統制、均無法前往收買、浙東春繭因運輸困難、亦無法運至上海、上海絲業、已瀕於絕境、</p>
<p>各地春繭上市日期</p>
<p>（一）浙江省杭嘉湖區、杭州五月二十三日、海寗五月二十四日、嘉興五月二十五日、湖州五月二十六日、蕭紹區、嵊縣五月十八日、新昌五月二十日、蕭山五月二十二日、紹興五月二十三日、（二）江蘇省蘇常區、宜興五月二十八日、蘇州五月二十九日、溧陽五月二十九日、金壇五月二十九日、常州五月三十日、錫常區無錫五月三十一日、江陰六月一日、常熟六月一日、江浙各地、大抵自五月中旬開始、迄六月上旬為止、前後不過二星期左右、</p>
<p>廠商停止收買春繭</p>
<p>江浙春繭、從前對於上海金融市塲、往往發生極大之影響、當春繭上市時、輒有大量現鈔由上海流入內地、足以引起上海洋拆之上漲、銀根緊縮現象、今年則不然、蓋上海銀錢同業對於淪陷區域之收繭貸款一律拒絕、同時各絲廠商人及餘繭商、對收繭已視為畏途、所以春繭上市在即、而組織公司、前往收莘者絕無、以致上海公共租界內各絲廠均因原料告罄停車、而開車遙遙無期、且有若干絲廠、已拆去絲車、改為其他工廠、</p>
<p>蠶農自繅土絲出售</p>
<p>內地家庭小絲廠、為戰後避免日商統制所新設者、是現絲廠、車數最多以四十部為限、所繅成之絲、售給各絲織廠之用、際此春繭將上市之時、紛赴日軍勢力所不及之各遊擊區域收買、並聞江浙兩省蠶農、對所採之繭、均不願售給統制機關、均自繅成土絲出售、惟各統制機關、竟抑低繭價、強行收買、所以蠶農均叫苦連天、並聞有若干蠶農、已運　繭至浙東出售、</p>

<h3>法租界垃圾工人　局方希望復工　訂鴣啼總辦發表罷工原因</h3>
<p>昨日下午四時、法公董局招待上海各報社新聞記者、到十餘人、由公董局督辦訂鴣啼發表談話如次、</p>
<p>清除工人突起罷工</p>
<p>對於法租界垃圾工人罷工事、發生於上月二十七日晨二時、各垃圾車時均已駛出、忽有一部份工人停止工作、棄車他去、未幾全體響應、查此次不幸事件、事先旣未有要求提出、亦無有人請願、事前局方毫不知情、公董局為顧全界內居民福利、臨時招雇白俄工人、清除垃圾、並為體諒工人苦衷、允許無條件復工、大部份工人已紛紛復工、不料上星期六分發工資時、因少數工人不滿意罷工時期內工資被扣、竟以石塊猛擲其他工人、故一部份又繼續罷工、局方為處置公平起見、不得不扣除罷工工人在罷工期內之工資、因駕駛垃圾車之工人、始終未曾加入之故、</p>
<p>局方仍盼照常工作</p>
<p>據氏秒、法租界全部華籍僱員、計有二千二百名、內工人計一千二百至一千五百名、此次繼續罷工者僅三百八十名、當局現仍希望彼等加入工作、至目前止、並無一人被開除、惟有人願意辭職者、一任自由、每月工資項下儲存全、儘讓領回、至領工資時、首先發動以石塊擊傷滋事者、共五十五名、現均羈押捕房中、公董局所屬之工人、最低階級在一九三七年月薪十七元、現增至一百零元至一百三十元、開車前為四十元、現增至一百六十二元七角八分、至於其他職員、前為九十一元、現增至二百八十七元、且每月又有米貼、三月份計四十五元、上月份增至五十五元、本月可希望增至六十六元、該項米貼、乃依每月十五日之米價計算、職工之無理要求加薪、結果徒屬加重界內各納稅人之負担而已、雙方不但並未進行會議、且局方始終亦未採取任何步驟、</p>

<p>規模甚大、探員捕獲諸匪、並未抄獲槍載、但信數日內當能抄出其所用武器、匪徒究犯若干罪案現未確悉、然已證明此輩匪徒曾活動於中區老閘區與成都路區、甚至在公共租界他區與法租界內犯案、亦屬可能、中央捕房探員於星期六夜首赴赴漢口路某旅社、以</p>
<p>迅速行動　在某號房間捕獲五匪、押返捕房、盤詰其活動情形與同黨所在、移時、探員又赴旅社捕獲三婦、聞皆與盜案有關、未幾、探員得法租界探員之合作、赴辣斐德路某旅社、僅捕獲一匪、依其所供、復得日當局之助、赴南市老西門某屋捕獲兩匪、均未發現槍械、警方相信該匪黨尙有在逃多名、被緝獲時、當可解決許多刦案、</p>

<h3>外人心目中的上海</h3>
<p>— （弢）</p>
<p>你有許多同鄉們實在太「天眞」了，有次我看見一大堆人圍聚着，我問是甚麼事，據說是在捉盜匪，我不相信他們都是在捉盜匪的探捕們；大槪他們都很好奇，所以細細的一看究竟，但却怨了探捕和盜匪是都帶有槍械的，自己站的是甚麼地位？這眞像小孩的玩火，太「天眞」了！</p>
<p>在德國西侵的時候，比荷法等國的難民，都亡命的逃離，把公路上的軍事運輸都阻礙了；在這裏很多的公共塲所內，有時常常也像逃離地擠利水洩不通，你搶我奪的爭先；其實大家如能客客氣氣的保守秩序，工作一定能照常的進行；相擠的力氣可省了不少，瑣碎的爭吵亦可免却很多，你說對麼？</p>
<p>大槪上海是一個商埠的原因，所以做生意的人特別多，有許多的醫生，律師，敎授，銀行家，記者，也都會做投機，和賣買的商品；似乎他們非兼做這生意不能維持生活似的，可是這裏的貧民們，却也就吃他們的大虧了！</p>
<p>你要我告訴你目下上海的生活程度，我簡單地告訴你：「我曾問一個黃色車夫，他說他一頓要吃十五個燒餅，每個五分，這就七毫五分，他一天吃三頓，光吃麵粉製的燒餅，一日就得化二元二毫五分，如此他每天必須有四元以上的收入，方能維持他的生活。這是低級華人的生活水凖，中級和高級呢，你也就可想見了！</p>
<p>上海是個大都市，關於它的事情，當然就是寫一世也寫不了，又況我是個剛到上海不久的外人！又在你「老上海」前來談這個題目，因此就不敢多寫了。將來有機會希望能再細細的看看，再細細的體味一下，再寫幾封更長的信和你談談。</p>
<p>我近來時常到那同船來的P小姐家裏去玩，上海的消遣，實在不適宜我的胃口。我住在滬西的法租界，這裏尙清凈，鄰居有很多種蔬菜的農民，住在矮黑的屋內，可是精神很飽滿，傍晚時常見他們一家一家的在小院內談笑，似乎很快樂，我看見他們，心中似比看見善於虛僞的闊人更高興。</p>
<p>話說多了，你說想返你的故鄉來，來吧來看看你這繁華的「孤島上海吧」！祝你有個愉快的旅行！再見！（沈）</p>

<h3>怎樣擇書（二）</h3>
<p>— 周良生</p>
<p>（三）關於興趣修養的　一個人的趣味是會變更的、一時喜歡文學的人、也許不久喜歡科學、關於修養方面、變更的情形更多、例如夏丐尊說的、「這位醫生除了醫生的職務以外、當然還有趣味或修養的生活、在趣味方面、他如果下圍棋、不妨看看關於圍棋的書、如果是喜歡的書、如果是喜歡文藝的、不妨看看詩歌小說一類的書、在修養方面、他如果是有志於品性的修煉的、自然會去看名人傳記或經典格言等一類書、如果覺得自己身體非鍛煉不可、自然會去看游泳運動等類的書、這是趣味或修養方面的閱讀」、</p>
<p>倘使我們是中學生、在學校學習、那末我們的職務、就是學習各種學科、在職務上應該閱讀的書、就是學校所規定的各科敎科書、閱讀敎科書、並非容易簡單的工作、應將每門的敎科書、好好地閱讀、</p>
<p>說到參考書呢、它的需要是臨時的、不必預先就決定的、不過我們參考之前、自己問問自己、必須參考的什麼、例如夏丐尊說的、「就國語科舉例說、在國語敎科書裏讀到一篇桃花源記、如果有不曾明白的辭兒、得翻辭典、這時辭典（假定辭源）就成了參考書、這篇文章、（桃花源記）、是晋人做的、如果覺得和別時候人所寫的文章、情味有些兩樣、要想知道晋代文的情形、就會去翻中國文學史、（假定是諷旡量論的中國文學史）、這時中國文學史就成了參考書、這篇文章裏所寫的是一種烏托邦思想、平日因了師友的指敎、知道英國有一位馬列斯的社會思想家寫過一本理想鄉消息和陶潛所寫的性質相近、拿來比較、這時理想鄉消息就成了參考書、這篇文章是屬於記叙一類的、如果想明白記叙文的格式、去翻看記叙文作法、（假定是孫俍工編的）、這時記叙文作法、就成了參考書、還有、這篇文章的作者叫陶潛、如果想知道他的為人、去翻晋書陶潛傳或陶集、這時晋書或陶集就成了參考書」、</p>
<p>二、擇書標準</p>
<p>書籍的範圍、非常廣泛、詳加選擇、原是一件很不容易的工作、有了選擇的原則、還要有一個適當的標準、如沒有適當的標準、有時恐怕不免反而徒勞精神空費時間、依照余天休意見、擇書的標準、是（一）不為宣傳所迷惑、（二）不為廣告所引誘、（三）非有益之書不讀、（四）非有名之書不讀、（四）非出版一年後仍有聲望之書不讀、（六）非有相當介紹的書不讀、（七）非普通書不讀、（此係指初學者而言）（八）非與已性相近之書不讀、（九）非精良的書不讀、（十）非有價值之書不讀、（十一）非含有善良敎訓的書不讀、（十二）非容易理解的書不讀、（十三）非與自己生活有關係的書不讀、（十四）引人為惡的書不讀、（十五）利益不足以補時間之損失的書不讀、（十六）不能應用的書不讀、（十七）不與自己程度相等的書不讀依照朱謙的意見、擇書的標準、是、第一要讀近代的書、不要讀陳舊的書、第二、要讀進步的書、不要讀落伍的書、第三、要讀一般的書、不要太專門的書、以上各家的意見、不過大同小異罷了、我以為書籍的範圍、旣是非常廣泛、條舉標準、確是不容易的事、為簡便起見、不妨把書籍區域做四個部門、（一）修養品格的、（二）增進知能的、（三）陶冶情趣的、（四）訓練思想的、</p>

<p>逸話</p>
<h3>鸚鵡新語</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>英國名生物學　裘理安赫胥黎，有一天在家裏閒步，突然聽到空襲警報聲。赫胥黎敎授本能地趕快向安全地點跑去，同時仰望空際，看德國飛機從那一個方向來襲，結果不但看不見飛機的影踪，也沒聽到飛機投擲炸彈的聲音。赫胥黎覺得奇怪，就運用了科學家的精神，對這神祕事件加以研究。結果發覺那空襲警報聲，原來是家裏一頭鸚鵡所發出的，因爲學得太像了，竟便主人誤爲眞的空襲警報。</p>
<p>最近幾月來，　爭中的英國鸚鵡，據說也有把炸彈墜落的聲響學得非常逼眞的，有時候竟使家裏的人喘喘不安起來鸚鵡。原是有閒階級的玩物，如今竟變成一種煩惱了。戰爭給予全世界的每個角落以影響，也增加了聰明的鸚鵡的新字彙。可是這對於鸚鵡將來的命運，恐怕不見得會有好結果的。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>心變</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>我的心變了嗎？怎麼它現在是這麽麻木不仁呢？</p>
<p>是誰在我的心頭上注入了迷醇的毒液，麻痺了它博愛的意識？是誰在我的心田裏撒上了荊棘的惡種，蒙蔽了它同情的根苗？</p>
<p>我這最善於感動的心，又不是從前有一次，看見平糶鬥前，那抖擻着鵠立在凜冽北風中的鳩形菜色的人環鏈，而曾爲之愴然下淚嗎？不是又有一决，看見大世界對面，那無聊的擺列在零濛細雨下的塗脂抹粉的肉屏風，而曾爲之悽然欲涕嗎？我也曾因爲讀了河北省幾千萬災民掘取草根樹皮以苟延殘喘的報告，而爲之食不下嚥！又曾因爲見了四川省某些個飢民竟然偷吃屍體的記載，而爲之鬱鬱終日！至於每一想到那掙扎在飛機大砲下的我國或歐洲的難民，那一幅斷臂折股扶老携幼的鮮明圖畫，更要叫我悲痛不已。</p>
<p>然而會幾何時呢？這顆依然故我的心，對於這一切一切，竟至視若無睹，漠然不動於中了！是司空見慣，我的感覺性被「習慣律」給磨鈍了嗎？是失望悲觀，抱了那「我躬不閱，遑恤我後」的見解嗎？……不，不，全不是！是因爲我深切明瞭了那哭泣悲傷對於事實毫無補益的緣故。</p>
<p>眞實的說；哭泣有什麼用處呢？哭泣，那不過給「淚腺」找點小工作而已！——就是你淚盡繼之以血，旁人的痛苦是否會因此而减輕？悲傷又有什麽好處呢？悲傷，那也不過在「意識之流」的那翻翻滾滾無量數的浪花裏，徒作幾個隨現隨隱，連一點痕跡也不留的泡沬而巳！——就是留些痕跡，社會的環境是否會因此而改善？</p>
<p>所以我往後非特不哭泣，不悲傷；，我反要愛惜我的眼淚，寶貴我的意識：因爲我要替它們索取重大的，或至少相稱的代價！就是說，我要把這潛藏於內的無用的力，變化成能表現於外的奮鬥的力！我要努力做一些些能够對人類社會有利益的工作！</p>
<p>我明明白白的知道：我在這人類的大蟻穴中，也不過是一個那麼渺小的螞蟻而巳；然而我要作一個勤勉的工蟻！那怕牠每天只搬運一粒食糧呢，牠也算竭了自已薄薄的力。我更淸淸楚楚的看出：我在這社會的大蜂巢中，也不過是一隻那麼卑微的蜜蜂而已；然而我要當一隻辛苦的職蜂！那怕他每月只採擷少許的花粉呢，他總算盡了自已區區的心。</p>
<p>我更要效法牛的堅毅，馬的精神。我要一步一步的向前邁進，直到蒸發了最後一滴汗，傾流了最後一滴血，呑嚥了最後一口氣！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（七）臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>「慢些，大師！」他立刻挨到老袁身邊去，陪着笑說：「這裏是租界，弄出事情不大好收拾；小的倒有一個計較，比槍斃他還要痛快！」</p>
<p>今天季兆雄眞不愧是袁寶藩的一個紅人了。</p>
<p>「你說！你說！」</p>
<p>「咱們不要殺死他，只用刀子在他臉上劃一個十字，使他從此見不得人，道一世便够他受用了！」季兆雄這一個念頭，倒已經不是此刻才想出來的了。方才他沒有向袁寶藩告密之前，他的另一個計劃便是弄一瓶消鏹水，毀壤秋海棠的容顏，略洩自己的忿氣，現在事情已經完全鬧開，他便覺得儘可爽爽快快的改用刀子了。</p>
<p>袁寶藩回頭去向秋海棠那一張雖然已變成灰白色，但始終還是很淸秀，很俊俏的臉龐看了一眼，便立即把頭一點。</p>
<p>當季兆雄移動脚步，打算奔出去拿刀子來的時候，秋海棠差一些又要昏過去了。平日因爲他天性愛美的緣故，臉上偶然生了一顆熱瘡，或是在什麽地方碰傷了一些，他心裏就像壓了一塊石頭一樣，往往不停的在鏡子面前照着，一天恨不得換幾種藥，直到瘡口收好，血痂晚去，臉上的確不曾留下什麼痕跡，他才能安心睡覺。現在季兆雄竟使這樣的狠心，偏不叫袁鎭守使亁乾脆脆的殺死他，而要用刀子在他臉上劃一個十字。（九八）</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>夜眼鏡</h3>
<p>— 李義</p>
<p>英國爲訓練陸軍在夜間作戰起見，特發明「夜眼鏡」一種，兵士戴此種眼鏡，立即四顧茫茫，恍如黑夜已臨大地者然。戴此種眼鏡以作打靶練習，可使兵士熟習於夜間作戰之情形。蓋夜間之景色，與白畫迴不相同，而步槍之瞄準器，亦無法運用。欲在此種情形之下作戰，非經特別之訓練不可也。</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>我們的家</h3>
<p>— 惠羅</p>
<p>我羨慕別人的甜蜜的家。</p>
<p>父親的轟檯子，擲傢具，撕衣服，母親的大哭大嚷，亂跳亂蹦，是我們的日常家課，每當這些時候，我和弟妹們，只好一溜烟的跑出去，在後門外面的弄堂裏「蹩」一點時間，否則，誰也避免不掉父親盛怒之下的毒打，然而這正像患瘧疾一樣，發作時固然是塞熱交加米勢汹汹，時間一過，恰便似雨過天晴，往往午後發病，晚飯時他們又已挽臂登車，同赴夜宴了。</p>
<p>父親是一個醫生，大概很早便踏進社會，從醫師助手而至自創醫院，其間是頗經過了一些奮鬥的歷程的，然而我很小的時候，便從工人及看護的口裏熟悉了父親在助手時代的偷藥故事，以及現在爲病人注射蒸溜水以替代維他命製劑的欺詐法術，每當父親揚揚得意的敘述他日創業經過時，往往會發生極端鄙夷的反感。</p>
<p>母親學過看護，但沒有學好，現在雖然掛了醫生的牌，却很少人領敎，然而她很驕傲，我時常聽見她厲聲斥責看護，而且總是夾雜着下面的幾句話：「我是院長太太，我是醫生，我也是護士長，誰敢不聽我的話？……」這些雖只能損傷她的尊嚴，她從不自覺，只有在被父親痛毆以後，才萎弱得像一條綿羊一樣，祖父母因之不敢和我們住在一起。</p>
<p>父親　母親的爭吵，大多是爲了另一個女人的事，從每年招收的新生裏，父親習慣的要引誘一位女生來滿足自已的慾望，一經被母親發覺，爭端便生，於是轟檯子，撕衣服，擲傢具……等到過了一個相當時期，奇怪的是母親竟會幫着父親巧妙的設計躱避法律方面應負的責任，而將另一位趕走，可憐多少淸淸白白的女孩子，被陷在終身精神痛苦的深淵裏，而我們也就因之惶惶然的時常担心着這些無可避免的紛爭所帶給我們的災難。</p>
<p>現在，父親又在最近招收的一批女生中選取了一個同住在外面，我對於她是很熟悉的，她才比我大一二歲呢，父親對她似乎迷戀特甚，除了白天回來看兩小時鬥診外，很少在家，把一切診務都交給了兩個助醫，母親自然常常提出抗議，所得的結果仍小外乎轟檯子，撕衣服，擲傢具，以及被毆打，但我們依然可以聽到她時常得意的嚷着：「我是院長太太，我是醫生，我是護士長。……」</p>
<p>什麼時候，我能離開我的家？</p>

<h3>介紹卡爾登新角</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>卡爾登自周信芳貼辭條後，當局就約平角言菊朋父子來滬，接周信芳後隊，所有全班人馬，除王熙春外，一律蟬聯。平角中除言菊朋小朋外，帶來琴手高正卿，打鼓魏希雲，配角馬連昆，王福山，陸喜才，陸洪瑞。卡爾登方面另邀坤角章逸雲，專為言三配戲，茲將各人藝術略述一二，以告同嗜。</p>
<p>言菊朋是票友出身，沉迷譚腔，數十年如一日，字音之研究，腔調之純正，菊部無第二人也。自余叔岩胎譚氏而自號余派後，菊朋繼其後，亦樹幟言派，從此在譚腔中間參已意，近十年來，因家庭多故，子女不肖，嗓變氣弱，無覆當年。乃致力於吐字取音，近年行腔使調，四音不倒，足為後進取法。惟以字太正而腔因此不圓，漸流於怪，且於譚之用湖廣音，學之過甚，致有時不類平劇，全變漢調。近年鑑於菊部寥落，不惜老命，出而掙扎，其精神毅力，殊可欽佩也。</p>
<p>言小朋為少朋之弟，唱武生，曾列丁永利門，扮相氣魄俱佳，惟根底稍遜，故能戲不多，可造之材也。</p>
<p>章逸雲，為章遏雲之妹，當遏雲在平津出演時，逸雲不過七八歲，近五六年來得乃姊之薰炙，並由芙蓉草胡鐵芬為之敎導，藝事已能窺遏雲堂奧，此次章姝出演卡爾登，據說是經某聞人之介紹，琴師胡鐵芬，打鼓魏希雲，皆遏雲隨手也。</p>
<p>馬連昆是言菊朋老搭檔，銅鎚架子，武二兼應，平正老練，不可多得，與言為配，極盡緣葉扶花之職，此人藝殊不弱，惜限於天賦，未享大名，</p>
<p>王陳山為王長林之哲嗣，藝宗乃父，尊幫余叔岩，故配譚派戲極對工，福山之在北平，除搭　班外，譚派老票友喜携他為配云。</p>
<p>陸喜才為富連成開山門六大弟子之一，工武丑，武技殊不惡同，肚子尤寬博，曾為楊小樓配「連環套」之朱光祖，「戰宛城」之胡車兒，「惡虎村」之王棟，「長板坡」之送死將，「拿高登」之秦仁，「連營寨」之馬童，此來除為小朋配戲外，兼為小朋說戲。武凈陸洪瑞，此人係第一次南來，藝平平，不及張連廷之衝，高盛虹之猛。</p>
<p>琴帥為高盛麟之堂兄高正卿，此人手音何如，技術又何如，以未得親聆不敢下評，鼓手魏三為北方鼓界三傑之一，三傑者，杭子和，喬玉泉及魏希雲也，杭專長打余派鬚生戲，故王少材料費陳少霖楊寶森輩　以左右手視之。喬久隨馬連良，肚子似比杭鳥寬，「甘露寺」，「一捧雪」，「借東風」等劇，手腕之靈活，點子之乾凈，今日鼓手中無與其匹。魏則專幫坤角，凡王瑤卿之徒，皆用魏為鼓師，為王幼卿，華慧麟，王玉蓉等皆是也。魏除擅打旦劇，兼能打生戲，故言菊朋亦當約渠為打鼓焉。</p>
<h3>記坤角李桂芬</h3>
<p>— 銀兒</p>
<p>今日在黃金登台之李桂芬女士，係故都名坤角，早年享名，在盂小冬之上，紅極一時，身上之邊式，嗓音之嘹亮，無與比擬。故彼時口碑載道，譽滿故都，嫁後輟演有年，誰知好景不常，其藁砧又告亡故，李女士遯跡春申，旣無登塲之興，亦鮮與外界往返，如此藝人，竟爾湮沒無聞，思之可嘆！旅滬知好，渴想重行瞻仰其藝術，乃發起盛大雅集，艾世菊，劉斌崑，芙蓉草等為配，此外更邀名坤票顧文綣小姐加入演唱女起解一折，預料今晚車水馬龍，定下盛況空前也</p>
<h3>故都菊訊</h3>
<p>— 燕趙樓主</p>
<p>譚富英已由津返平，定五月七日出演廣德，旦角仍約侯玉蘭。</p>
<p>此次隨言三來滬凈角馬連崑之子馬幼昆，工譚派老生，曾露演失空斬於廣和樓。</p>
<p>毛世來將樊梨花之戲集為一本，改名姑嫂英雄，自飾樊梨花，短期內即將出演。</p>
<p>言慧珠自拜朱桂芳為師後，專演梅派名劇，即配角亦為梅劇團如姜妙香，蕭長華，劉連榮，王少亭等。</p>
<p>後起二路旦角任志秋，為于蓮仙之徒，在平甚為走紅</p>
<p>小程硯秋劉迎秋，禦霜之得意弟子，已應友約，組班出演於廣德，戲自為「罵錦袍」，是劇係蔣偶虹所編，配角為趙德鈺，張金　，陳盛泰，李雯溪等</p>

<p>第八章　落花有意隨流水</p>
<p>王永泰便留許靖下榻其家。又告　他說自己因為多年喪偶，奔走天涯，形單影隻，孑然一身，在這裏起初又生了一塲病，乏人奉侍，所以周遇吉將軍屢勸納一姬妾，可以朝夕相陪。遂有同袍介紹本城一何姓的女子，給我納為　室，遂下居於此。居然有了家庭，寗不再笑？王永泰說了，哈哈地笑了數聲。許靖道：「伯父年老，理應有人侍奉巾櫛，他日若能誕生石麟，繼述有後，更可喜了。」王永泰又笑道：「老朽一人疏散慣了，倒並不希望什麼兒孫繞膝，以慰桑榆暮景，好在舍弟在江陵，他兒子很多，足夠嗣與我的，不怕為若敖氏不食之鬼。你是我知友的公郎，和自家人一樣，待我引見，彼此也可認識。」許靖道：「小姪理當拜謁的。」王永泰遂興忽忽的帶着許靖，走至後堂，吩咐小婢快請何姬出見。一會兒聽得環佩聲響，有侍婢數人簇擁著一位少婦出見：雲髻烏髪，光可鑑人，杏臉桃腮，柳眉鳳目，生得十分美麗，體態也很輕盈，年華尙不過二十左右，綺裳雲穀，倍極妍麗。許靖連忙拜見。何姬也檢袵答禮。王永泰便指著許靖對何姬說道：「這位姓許名靖，是故人之子，此番到這裏來投軍，下棍我家，你當好好款待。」何姬嬌聲應諾。坐談數語，許靖使告退出來，由下人導至客室中坐。不多時早有侍婢拿著衾枕出來，代許靖收拾坑上，舖好被褥，然後退去。這夜許靖便住在王永泰家中。明日早餐後，王永泰便引許靖到總兵衙署中去見周遇吉。許靖見周遇吉白凈面皮，猿臂蜂腰，生得英風凜凜，不愧是干城良材，慌忙拜倒。周遇吉親手扶起，請他坐在一邊。王永泰先把許靖的出身來歷向周遇吉禀明了，又說起他投軍的志願，要請周遇吉錄用。周遇吉瞧許靖人品出眾，點頭稱許，便說道：「此刻正是國家用人之秋，有志之士自不甘懷瑾握瑜，埋沒蓬蒿，揮我橫靡，掃彼寇氛，你來得正好，我這裏正需要良材，就委屈你暫住我帳下充當一名雲旂尉，他日如有功勞，再可擢升。」許靖道：「謝謝大人栽培之德，輒生願效馳驅。」於是告退出來。從此請靖便在周遇吉麾下供職。（五五）</p>

<h3>Zhang Zhizhong Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Chongqing - General Zhang Zhizhong, former Commander of the Shanghai War Front and current Director of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, addressed four hundred cultural leaders last night, criticizing Chinese who left Chongqing after the New Fourth Army incident as having abandoned the war effort, and urged national cultural leaders to unite under the banner of resistance and national reconstruction. Zhang stated that even if external aid were cut off, China would fight to the end, and emphasized that the national reconstruction movement would be implemented on the principle of self-reliance. Zhang urged those who left Chongqing for overseas after the New Fourth Army incident to return to Chongqing. Following a discussion of neutrality treaties, Zhang declared, "I can confidently say that we will definitely recover the four northeastern provinces and Outer Mongolia," adding that the Soviet-Japanese treaty's so-called mutual recognition of the borders of Outer Mongolia and Manchuria was meaningless. He also said, "Some people think that those who are our enemies today may be our friends tomorrow, but I believe that those who are our enemies will always be our enemies."

<h3>Travelers to Hong Kong No Longer Require Visas</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Since January 14th of this year, Hong Kong has implemented immigration control regulations, requiring Chinese citizens traveling to Hong Kong to hold a passport issued by their own country and obtain a visa from a British consulate in various locations before being allowed to enter or transit. The fee for this entry visa was approximately 60 yuan in national currency, while the transit visa cost 3 yuan. The procedures were tedious and inconvenient for travelers. After repeated negotiations with the British side by our diplomatic authorities, it has now been confirmed that the British side has agreed to waive these visa requirements. From now on, Chinese citizens can travel to Hong Kong with a passport and will no longer need to obtain a visa from a British consulate. (5th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Delivers Speech Commemorating Wilson's Birthday - Democracy Will Ultimately Triumph - U.S. Will Not Hesitate to Fight Again for This</h3>
<p>Staunton - President Roosevelt predicted yesterday the absolute victory of democratic countries and the destruction of aggressors, because "those who constantly play with swords will ultimately die by the sword." Roosevelt delivered this speech at the former home of President Woodrow Wilson, who was born on December 28, 1856, during the last world war. The residence has been made a memorial to Wilson. Among those present during the President's speech were several people, such as Secretary of State Hull and British Ambassador to the United States Lord Halifax. Roosevelt visited the former residences of two former American presidents over the weekend. In addition to President Wilson's former residence, Roosevelt also visited former President Monroe's "Ash Lawn" (i.e., President Monroe's former residence) on Saturday. The current "Monroe Doctrine" of the United States was advocated by President Monroe. President Roosevelt's current policy is based on the teachings of these two former presidents. President Roosevelt said in his speech yesterday, "We gather today to admire a new memorial to freedom. By this action, we express our true belief. What is this simple belief? It is freedom and democracy. We have fought for this belief before, and we will always be prepared to fight for this belief again. I think that the most appropriate place for you Americans to reaffirm your belief in democracy is at the birthplace of President Wilson." President Roosevelt continued to discuss Wilson's life and said, "At a time when the world is experiencing a tragic conflict that threatens everything our free people love, past historical records prove that the true progress of mankind lies in a true understanding of spiritual values. Those who constantly rely on swords to solve everything will ultimately die by the sword." The President also said, "Physical strength cannot resist spiritual strength for long. Wilson's life, though filled with hardships, is a victory of spirit over violence. Under his leadership, our country has made significant spiritual progress. Regarding Mr. Wilson, I can make the following remarks: When the world was ruled by material thinking, insatiable greed, and revenge, he alone could see a brilliant realm. Selfish people, who believe in force, cannot sympathize with his ideal of liberating the world. He will be considered an immortal statesman. When people are seeking revenge and material pursuits, he alone seeks to bring the day of Asia's liberation closer and replace violence in the world with freedom. The fact that Wilson's home will be preserved by us for a long time is a story of America. In this basin, Virginia will keep evidence for America, so that people know that Wilson's liberal ideas will support democracy in the world. He taught us that democracy cannot survive in isolation. We are deeply impressed by his judgment and belief." (5th United Press dispatch) Berlin - Authoritative German sources recently commented on President Roosevelt's speech in Staunton (according to which President Roosevelt predicted that the Republic will certainly win and aggressors will surely lose), saying that this speech is only a matter for the United States and has nothing to do with Europe, and also saying that "We will let history answer the historical question from Wilson to Roosevelt, and turning former President Wilson's house into a shrine (that is, worshipping Wilson) has no impact on Europe."

<h3>Dutch East Indies Not Planning to Make Concessions to Japan</h3>
<p>Batavia - Well-informed sources here believe today that the chances of the Dutch-Japanese commercial negotiations collapsing are 5 to 53. The minutes of the negotiations have been sent to Tokyo, and the Japanese representative expects to receive a reply within three or four days. If Tokyo accepts the proposal, the commercial negotiations will be completed soon, as only formal issues remain to be resolved. The attitude of the Dutch government and the general public is very firm, and no further concessions can be made on the conditions stipulated in the proposal. Previously, observers had doubts as to whether the Netherlands would persist, but reliable sources now insist that the Netherlands will definitely not make concessions.

<h3>Rapid Development of Soviet Civil Aviation - Also Assists with Agricultural Work</h3>
<p>Moscow - Regarding Soviet summer aviation, "Aviation Magazine" stated, "In 1941, the technical development of Soviet civil aviation has been extremely rapid. Last year, the PS-84 type of adjusted-bottom aircraft only flew to four cities, but this year this type of aircraft will fly to dozens of cities such as Gorky and Odessa. Night flights will be implemented for the first time, and one can arrive from Sverdlovsk to Novosibirsk overnight. In addition, the use of aircraft to kill agricultural pests will also be carried out on a large scale, and civil aircraft will scatter various insecticides on 365,000 hectares of farmland. As for the work of using aircraft to spread fertilizer, it will also be carried out in Belarus and other regions, with a scale that is eleven times larger than last year." (5th TASS dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Future of the Near East War Situation</h3>
<p>China, Japan, the Philippines, and Vietnam, etc., these parts of eastern Asia, close to the Pacific Ocean, are habitually referred to as the Far East; in contrast to the Far East, countries such as Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Arabia, etc., in western Asia, close to the Mediterranean Sea, are habitually referred to as the Near East (also known as the Middle East, with the Balkan Peninsula being considered the Near East). In short, the Far East and the Near East do not have clear boundaries, but are based on Europe, and in the minds of Europeans, they are regarded as the east, divided into far and near; people in the Far East, and even people more east than the Far East, echo each other, and habitually call this the Far East and that the Near East. Without considering whether its name actually conforms to reality, its being a sign of the latent power of European culture is beyond doubt. Now, the European war has expanded to the Near East. The expansion of the European war to the Near East is very likely to spread from the Far East and form a world war.</p>
<p>The two actors on the Near East war stage are the British army and Iraq; the fighting began four days ago, on May 2nd. So far, the news is mixed and contradictory, and it is not known who initiated the conflict first. Who went first and who went after is not about responsibility, but about military strategy. In other words, thinking from the perspective of the global situation, we hope that the British side, in terms of military strategy, has a firm grasp and is in a proactive position, and in this corner, this time, can seize the initiative and resolve the situation as soon as possible. Of course, we do not think that Iraq should be under British control, because we should sympathize with every nation's struggle for independence and freedom, and Iraq's resentment towards Britain is a matter of course; but turning to a stronger and more violent overlord, leading to a revolutionary coup, and seizing power, not hesitating to be the new master's henchmen, is not allowed to be covered by the banner of fighting for independence and freedom. We also do not believe that this time, assuming that the British army launched a preemptive strike, and that Iraq was caught off guard by a sudden foreign invasion; because in the midst of the turbulent world situation, during the struggle between Britain and Germany, the change of the Iraqi regime from pro-British to pro-German was in early April; the pro-German government of Iraq would not believe that the British side would willingly yield and remain silent, and after a month, there would be no precautions against Britain. Therefore, if the British-Iraqi fighting was initiated by Iraq, then we cannot help but imagine the seriousness of the British-Iraqi war situation.</p>
<p>Iraq's culture and industry are very backward; the population is only over three million, which is even less than the city of Shanghai; the political situation is notoriously corrupt and complex; the combat power is poor and weak, and it is by no means a match for Britain; assuming that the Near East war only has these two actors at present, then the scope is narrow, the scale is small, and Britain can use the spirit of suppression to quell the rebellion in a short period of time, and lay a more solid foundation of control than in the past. A blessing in disguise. However, no matter what the facts are, one cannot be so lightly optimistic. In view of the subtle relationships of religion, race, and grievances, what will be the reaction of the countries surrounding Iraq, such as Turkey, Iran, Arabia, and Syria, to the engagement of these two actors? In view of the strategic relationships of politics, economy, and military affairs, what will be the attitude of Iraq's neighbor, the Soviet Union, towards this change? These reactions and attitudes, which have not yet been determined, will all directly and indirectly affect the British-Iraqi war and the situation in the Near East. As for Germany, apart from the sky, there is no direct route to Iraq; and yesterday's news from Berlin still said that Germany adopted a reserved attitude towards this British-Iraqi conflict; that is, although Iraq is confronting Britain, Germany will not send troops "to confront Britain here and strike at it." However, the news that German aircraft flew over Syria to Iraq has been reported; and the fact that the Nazi party was actually behind the Iraqi coup is an open secret; and Hitler, on the one hand, coveted Iraqi oil, and on the other hand, planned to crush Britain; in North Africa, the German-Italian Allied forces attacked Egypt as the right wing of Germany's strategy to cut off the Suez Canal, while the Iraqi side was the left wing of coercing the Suez Canal. Thus, between Britain and Iraq, if it is an accidental conflict, or the initiation of British military strategy, then that is all; otherwise, if Iraq's war with Britain is a timely launch of part of Hitler's military strategy, then the world should pay great attention.</p>
<p>Assuming that this is a timely launch of part of Hitler's military strategy, it is conceivable that the scope of the Near East war will not be limited to Iraq; the military involvement of Arabia, and the political, diplomatic, and even military involvement of the Soviet Union and Turkey, will all become an integral part of the issue. Not only that, but when any stronghold of Britain on both sides of the Suez Canal is shaken, it will be the first opportunity for Japan to launch its military southward advance after today. And Japan, after signing the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Treaty in quick succession, has recently suddenly expressed its various attitudes to the United States; this is because Japan, in the absence of any other way, has not completely given up its dream of obtaining a compromise with the United States, and it is also because Japan, before another adventure, is testing its final anesthesia on the United States and applying its final smokescreen. Subsequent developments will be closely related to the Near East war situation.</p>
<h3>America Will Use Surplus Food as Its Primary Diplomatic Weapon, Resisting and Aiding Axis Countries, The Slogan "Food Will Win" Revives</h3>
<p>Washington – The slogan that "food can win wars," popular during the last World War, has recently been revived. The executive branch plans to use America's surplus agricultural products to supply Britain with food while pressuring countries dependent on the Axis powers. President Roosevelt recently stated that he had instructed Secretary of Agriculture Wickard and General Barham, who had just returned from London, to formulate a food aid plan for Britain. The Department of Agriculture also stated that most of Britain's food needs could be met by America's massive surplus, with the remaining small portion to be met by the 1940 planting. It is claimed that this approach would enable Britain to obtain ample supplies without reducing America's surplus below the "reserve point." The acreage anticipated by the Department of Agriculture is: barley at 63,408,000 acres (compared to 62,395,000 acres in 1940), grains at 87,656,000 acres (compared to 88,156,000 acres last year), oats at 37,102,000 acres (compared to 36,237,000 acres last year), and tobacco at 1,404,000 acres (compared to 1,427,000 acres last year). It is expected that this production will not only fully supply Britain but also provide sufficient surplus to supply any country resisting the Axis powers. The sending of food to countries resisting aggression will be implemented according to the provisions of the US$7 billion Lend-Lease Act. This US$7 billion appropriation includes US$1.5 billion for agricultural and industrial goods. The United States is now using food loans and relief funds as diplomatic weapons against countries under the Axis's oppressive forces against Britain. President Roosevelt's statement that the United States might ship food to Spain clearly indicates the above-mentioned action. However, one country receives American food aid not for resisting aggression, namely Finland. Finland, which lost much land to the Soviet Union a year ago, is now in dire need of assistance. Secretary of Commerce Jones has announced that the Export-Import Bank will lend Finland another US$5 million to purchase food. The Free Zone of France will also generally receive two ships of food once the supervisory distribution method negotiated with the American Red Cross is finalized. This method of supplying food may also be used to deal with Turkey and prevent it from resolutely joining the Axis. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<h3>US Aircraft Production Exceeds Germany's, According to Willkie</h3>
<p>Nashville – Republican leader Willkie declared yesterday that "within three to at most six months, the military equipment and aircraft produced by the United States alone will exceed those of Germany. If we can maintain the openness of the sea lanes, then Hitler will definitely not be able to invade the United States." Willkie stated in a speech at the groundbreaking ceremony of the Voltee Aircraft Plant, "The United States must ensure the transportation of military supplies to Britain. If Britain can maintain maritime superiority and gain air superiority, then in 1943, Britain will be on the path to victory, and freedom will come." (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<h3>US Actively Stockpiles Tin for Military Use</h3>
<p>Washington – The Production Management Office issued a notice today requesting a 10% reduction in the tin coating on the outside of tin cans to stockpile tin for national defense. The notice stated that the tin currently owned by the United States and being transported to the United States is sufficient for 14 months of national defense needs. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<h3>US Pays Close Attention to the Atlantic War</h3>
<p>Washington – The focus of attention here remains on the Atlantic War. The entire country now supports President Roosevelt's shipping policy. Newspaper criticism and wireless commentary largely support the convoy advocacy of Republican leader Willkie. Some quarters are concerned that Germany may seize Dakar and Cape Verde Islands in West Africa. Newspapers also express lively concern about the important interests of the United States in the Atlantic. The New York Post carried the comments of military commentator Major Eliot, advocating that the United States should take the offensive at this time. Another writer also expressed his opinion in the newspaper that President Roosevelt must currently decide on the issue of war and peace for the United States, and that Britain cannot win without the active participation of the United States.

<h3>US Senators Request Congress to Pass Foreign Vessel Conscription Bill</h3>
<p>Washington – Senator Pepper said yesterday, "If necessary, we must convoy military supplies to Britain." The Senate will convene today to debate the convoy issue. Admiral Landon has asked Congress to quickly pass the bill to requisition 500,000 tons of foreign ships now stranded in American ports, stating that current shipping difficulties are a matter of urgency. Landon hopes that the bill can be passed within two days, but Congressional leaders predict that it will take at least two weeks to complete. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Makes Another Peace Overture, Says He Will Not Go to the US, But the US President Must Visit Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka stated last night in Kyoto that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull should visit Japan to understand Japan's true intentions. When asked if Foreign Minister Matsuoka would go to the United States, he replied, "I have a deep understanding of the United States, so there is currently no need for me to go to the United States. On the contrary, President Roosevelt and Mr. Hull should come to Japan to understand the actual situation here and Japan's true intentions." Matsuoka declined to explain Japan's policy toward the United States, saying, "I personally intend to pursue a sincere peace policy to the end because I deeply believe that sincerity can move everything. This sincerity is my belief. If sincerity cannot produce results, then I can do nothing." Matsuoka stated that he is determined to fulfill all responsibilities and use diplomacy to resolve the China Incident. Although he did not explicitly reveal it, he indicated that he had discussed this matter with Stalin in Moscow. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<h3>California Clipper Flies to Honolulu, Will Go to Singapore via the Philippines, First Passengers Number Thirty-One</h3>
<p>Honolulu – The California Clipper, inaugurating the new weekly air route from the United States to Singapore, arrived here at 4:00 PM yesterday (9:30 AM Monday Shanghai New Time), with approximately thirty-one passengers on board. The plane is scheduled to depart at 8:00 PM, stopping en route at Wake Island and Guam. The plane left San Francisco on Sunday, less than 48 hours after President Roosevelt signed the order authorizing the establishment of the route. The plane will make a brief stop in Manila before proceeding to Singapore. The journey from Manila to Singapore, a distance of 1,500 miles, involves flying over the China Sea (i.e., the South Seas). The Clipper flies from San Francisco to Singapore, a distance of 10,000 miles, in less than six days. Pan American Airways announced that Hong Kong, originally a point on the Pacific air route, will continue to have flights to and from it every other week. The initial flight only carries mail and inspectors from the civil aviation authorities, and normal passenger service will be handled later. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>

<h3>Workers Strike at Bethlehem Steel Plant</h3>
<p>San Francisco – Two hundred skilled workers employed at the Bethlehem Steel Company shipyard here demanded double pay if they were to work as usual on Saturdays. The factory management did not approve, so they went on strike. However, this dispute is not difficult to resolve, and it is expected that work will resume tomorrow. (Havas, 4th)</p>

<h3>New Cambodian King Pledges Allegiance to Pétain</h3>
<p>Hanoi – Norodom Sihanouk, the new king of Cambodia, telegraphed Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux yesterday after his accession to the throne in Phnom Penh, expressing allegiance to France. The original telegram stated: "At the beginning of my accession, I especially express to Your Excellency my and my people's loyalty and confidence in France, and I hope to convey this intention to Marshal Pétain.

<h3>US Does Not Emphasize Hitler's Speech, Britain Considers His Released Casualty Figures as Propaganda</h3>
<p>Washington – Hitler's speech in parliament last night apparently did not elicit much criticism here. General observers believe that what Hitler said was merely a response to Churchill's use of the entire British force in a unified resistance. Some initially expected that Hitler would take this opportunity to attack the United States, but he focused his attacks exclusively on Churchill. People here point to this as an indication that Germany's recent victories have not compensated for Hitler's plans, which require breaking through the defenses of the British Isles. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington – Official sources, after listening to Hitler's speech yesterday, only predicted that Hitler would soon inevitably realize that his commentary on the "weak and ineffective US aid to Britain" was greatly mistaken. Tank cars and aircraft are being continuously exported from American manufacturing plants. Bombers fly directly from Canada to Britain, and tank cars are shipped to Africa and troubled areas. These items can produce a military impact within a few months. As for the number of German casualties in the Balkans shown by Hitler, it is extremely doubtful. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Commemorates Newspaper Day, Daily Sales of 16 Million Copies</h3>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet Union today commemorates Soviet Newspaper Day throughout the country. The Soviet National Bookstore published statistics stating that in 1913, Russia only had 849 types of newspapers with a circulation of 2.7 million copies, but by 1940, the Soviet Union had 9,000 types of newspapers with a daily circulation of 38 million copies. The increase in newspapers in the Soviet republics is even greater. For example, the Tyva Republic and the Kyrgyz Republic previously had no newspapers or books, but currently, the two republics have 149 types of newspapers. In 1940, the new Soviet republics printed a total of 200 types of newspapers. Under the Soviet government, a total of 7.3 million types of books were printed, with a total circulation of 860 million copies. All books in 1940 were printed in 84 languages. The number of literary books has increased several times. Under Soviet rule, Pushkin's works were printed in 72 languages in 30 million copies, Gorky's works were printed in 65 languages in 40 million copies, and Tolstoy's works were printed in 57 languages in 21 million copies.

<h3>Rumors of Germany Striking Iraq and Iran via Turkey, Half of Iraqi Air Force Destroyed, British Forces Advance Towards the Iraqi Capital</h3>
<p>London – Britain's rapid occupation of Basra and the Iraqi return to Iraq, attempting to regain power, has sparked speculation here today that Hitler may suddenly strike Iraq and Iran via Turkey. Political circles here believe that Hitler's cautious response to Ali Gaylani's appeal is because Hitler hopes that the Iraqi leader can drive out the British troops on his own. However, the defeat of Ali Gaylani's troops has immediately warned Hitler to quickly prepare to take the initiative to seize precious oil. Political circles say that if Hitler wins the battle in Iraq, he can have three choices in the war against Iran. When using force against Iran, Germany can bomb the oil production centers in the southwest. Germany can also try to drive out the British troops in the Basra area and attack Iran. The final step is to use diplomatic pressure to force Iran to cede oil fields to Germany. It is believed here that Hitler will take the last step, as this move can keep the oil fields intact. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Cairo – British aircraft have fiercely attacked Iraqi airfields for two consecutive days, destroying half of the Iraqi Air Force. According to a special communique, British Air Force bombers attacked the Iraqi Moskar Rashid airfield on Saturday, hitting buildings and hangars. One Iraqi plane on the ground was destroyed, and several others were hit nearby. Two Iraqi planes attempted to attack but were shot down by escorting aircraft. On Sunday, British aircraft again fiercely attacked the area, and the airfield hangars and factories were heavily damaged. At least twenty-two Iraqi planes were bombed. The railway was also bombed, and the first train of armored vehicles derailed and overturned. British aircraft also repeatedly bombed Iraqi artillery positions, mechanized units, and concentrated Iraqi troops. Many bombs hit, and both sorties of British aircraft returned east. It was also announced that the Habbaniya airfield was shelled by Iraqi troops early yesterday morning, with slight casualties among non-combatants. British aircraft retaliated by bombing and strafing enemy mechanized forces and transport units, resulting in the gradual suppression of Iraqi artillery fire. (Reuter, 5th)</p>
<p>London – According to news here yesterday, British bombers struck the Iraqi army airfield in Baghdad, and imperial troops occupied the airfields and docks of Basra. As British aircraft rained bombs on Baghdad's airfield, imperial troops advanced along the Tigris River towards the capital. Meanwhile, Axis sources claimed that Iraqi troops had cut off the Haifa oil pipeline. The British War Department announced that British troops had seized the airfield and docks of Basra after fierce land and air battles. The Habbaniya airfield, 65 miles from Baghdad, is still under fierce fighting. It was reported from the Ankara radio station that fierce battles were unfolding near Kirkuk, the end point of the Haifa oil pipeline. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Beirut – It is rumored that Iraqi Prime Minister Ali Gaylani has flown to Berlin. Well-informed sources here say that this is quite possible. In any case, if not to Berlin, then secretly to Turkey to meet with German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German Foreign Ministry announced this afternoon that Germany is paying close attention to and is extremely satisfied with the situation in Iraq. The Iraqi army has demonstrated its excellent courage. The success of the Iraqi army has shaken Britain's position in Iraq. Regarding rumors that the Iraqi government has requested assistance from Germany, no comment was made here. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Visits Turkish Foreign Minister, Reports in Detail on the Situation in Iraq, Turkish People Sympathize with Britain</h3>
<p>Ankara – British Ambassador to Turkey Knatchbull-Hugessen visited Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu yesterday and presumably reported in detail to the Turkish Foreign Minister on all the latest developments in the situation in Iraq. The Turkish people seem to greatly understand and sympathize with the British actions, and they express regret for the actions taken by Ali Gaylani under the instigation of the Axis powers. Ali Gaylani's request for help from Germany has greatly reduced his credibility here, as the Axis powers, if they can provide him with effective assistance, will result in Turkey being surrounded by the Axis powers. However, the Turkish people acknowledge that the Axis powers may not be able to provide support. Non-official circles in Turkey believe that Germany has been extensively inciting in Arab countries and Iran, while Britain has not taken precautions, causing the situation to develop to this point, so they all express regret. It is believed that the main figure in German instigation in the Near East is the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, who will return here soon. It is expected that after Papen returns here, Germany will redouble its efforts to trap Britain in a difficult situation. The claim by the Baghdad radio station that there are now Arab combatants in Palestine may indicate that Germany will attempt to cause disturbances in Palestine. (Reuter, 5th)</p>

<h3>German Planes Fiercely Bomb Belfast, Northern Ireland, Large Shops and Churches Turn to Rubble, People of Southern Ireland Go to Rescue the Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>Belfast – The Nazi hordes, implementing pressure to blockade the ports of western Britain in order to destroy the lifelines leading to the United States, flew to this port again in the early hours of today, bombing it for three and a half hours, turning this port into flames. Several hundred German aircraft threw various forms of bombs at Belfast, especially incendiary bombs. Countless houses have turned into piles of rubble. Looking around, all that can be seen is devastation. The bombing suffered by this port this morning is the most severe disaster the port has ever encountered. Despite such misfortune, it has established a kind of sympathy in a few hours between Northern and Southern Ireland that no British or Irish politician could have created. Large groups of Nazi aircraft committed indiscriminate killing and destruction for three and a half consecutive hours. Many important thoroughfares were subjected to the explosion of countless bombs. Most of the city has been reduced to dirt. It is feared that the number of dead and injured must be considerable. While the savage aerial blitz was attacking this port and now turning into a sea of fire, the fire brigade of Eire was unwilling to violate the boundaries of neutrality and bravely assisted the countrymen suffering severe oppression on the Irish border. As the reporter writes, the exhausted Eire people are still working bravely with the Ulster firefighters in the smoke-filled streets. The people of Belfast express warm gratitude to the many Eire people for their righteous actions. This kind of gratitude is greatly conducive to the close friendship and union between Northern and Southern Ireland. Dublin this morning provided all possible assistance to this affected city. Thousands of homeless people are collecting their money and belongings, moving to Eire and the northern region of Ireland. Extremely fierce anti-aircraft fire fired at the attackers in the moonlit sky. Authoritative sources declared that seven German aircraft were shot down in Belfast and over Britain last night and this morning. This attack was more brutal than the one on April 15. Large shops, churches, and public offices have mostly turned into smoking piles of rubble. The main target of the German aircraft seems to be Belfast, with Liverpool, Merseyside, and a certain city in the northwest being secondary targets. When the German aircraft bombed Belfast, they first dropped incendiary bombs like rain, followed by hundreds of high-explosive bombs. Some of these bombs seemed to be larger than those previously dropped on this port. When the informants reported this news to London, timed bombs frequently exploded. Anti-aircraft fire formed a continuous fire net in the air raid, and night fighters soared around the perimeter of the anti-aircraft fire net, engaging with the attackers with dense machine gun and aircraft cannon fire. Large fires broke out in many places in the port, but most of them were extinguished or brought under control after the air raid. The firefighters worked bravely during the air raid. Even with bombs raining down on their heads, they fought with the flames in a crazy battle. Although the German aircraft's air raid on this port was not as long as the attacks on some cities in Britain, its intensity was extremely fierce. A communique issued by the British Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security in London stated that German aircraft had launched a large-scale attack on Britain last night. Northern Ireland, the Northwest, and Merseyside suffered particularly badly. In addition to fires and losses in some places, many people were killed and injured. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>

<h3>Hitler's Speech - Full Text</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday) Hitler continued, saying, "My peace proposals were seen as signs of fear and cowardice. The warmongers in Europe and America used this to deceive the public. My warning against night bomber attacks on civilians was also seen as a sign of German weakness. People generally believed that the German Air Force's self-restraint was clear proof that German planes could not fly at night. Churchill allowed British newspapers to promote to the public that only the British Air Force could adopt this type of air combat. The British Air Force's fierce bombing of German civilians and Britain's blockade measures were methods to force the German people to surrender. I have repeatedly issued warnings about this issue for three months, but these warnings have not impressed Churchill. I am not surprised; how much does he care about the lives of others? Does he still care about culture and cultural construction? When the European war broke out, Churchill declared that he hoped for war, even if several British cities would be reduced to ashes, he would not hesitate. Currently, Churchill has achieved his wish. I have stated that for every bomb the enemy drops, we will retaliate with a hundred. This warning failed to make Churchill consider the consequences of his actions. He declared that this warning could not trouble him and assured the British public that after inspecting the cities bombed by German planes, the sight of ruins and rubble filled him with joy and that he felt a hundred times more courageous upon returning to London. Churchill may be using this to strengthen his resolve to continue this type of warfare, but we are also determined to retaliate against Britain's bombs, and we will wait until the British people remove Churchill. Due to Churchill's abnormal attitude, Britain decided to turn the Balkans into a battlefield. He is like a madman searching for something to ignite in Europe. After five years, those who have been bought off reopened the door, which is truly regrettable. During the French campaign, the German army obtained French secret documents, discovering that France, between 1939 and 1940, had attempted to turn the Balkans into a battlefield, mobilizing hundreds of divisions of troops to assist Britain. Although the collapse of France prevented this plan from being realized, Churchill never abandoned it. However, after Romania joined the Tripartite Pact, Churchill felt that this plan was even more difficult to realize."</p>
<p>Balkan Policy</p>
<p>Hitler then stated Germany's Balkan policy: "(1) Germany has no territorial or political interests in the Balkans. It is not interested in the territorial and internal affairs issues that arise from the selfishness of various countries. (2) Germany will strive to increase economic relations with Balkan countries. This discovery is not only beneficial to Germany but also beneficial to the countries involved because Germany is an industrial nation that needs food and raw materials, and Balkan countries have agricultural products and raw materials and need industrial goods. If British and American individuals believe that this policy is a sign of German power invading the Balkans, it is extremely foolish. All countries should determine economic policies based on national interests and not based on the interests of Jewish and democratic capitalists as the standard for economic policies. (3) Germany hopes that countries engaged in mutual trade will maintain a healthy and strong state. Germany strives to assist all countries in consolidating domestic order and does not care about specific political systems. Due to the above measures, Balkan countries are not only becoming increasingly prosperous but have also embarked on a path of mutual trust. However, Churchill is also striving to obstruct this peaceful development. Britain's guarantees to Balkan countries use worthless promises of aid, creating instability and a lack of confidence in peaceful Southeastern Europe. Greece does not need this guarantee, but due to Britain's temptation, it shares the hardships with those who bribe the royal family. I believe that a distinction should be made between Greece's corrupt leaders and the Greek people. It is regrettable that the Greek leadership, incited by the King controlled by Britain, values British policy and disregards Greek goals. I have always praised Greek culture, and it pains me to witness this development and be unable to help. Churchill implemented his guarantees and promises last summer, causing Greece to repeatedly violate its neutrality. Italy was greatly affected and had to propose a suggestion to the Greek government last October, demanding a guarantee to cease this intolerable situation. However, the Greek government decisively rejected this request due to British pressure, and the peace in the Balkans could not be maintained."</p>
<p>German Attack Plan</p>
<p>"The harsh climate and the brave fighting of the Greek army gave the Greek government ample time to consider and find a reasonable solution. Germany had little hope of clarifying this situation. Although the warning to repel troops landing in Europe was ignored by Britain, Churchill redeployed British troops to Greece when the Italian army suffered losses in North Africa. After confirming Britain's intention to intervene in the Balkans, I initiated the necessary steps to prevent Britain's conspiracy. Therefore, Germany's initial assistance to Bulgaria was not to aid Italy in attacking Greece but merely to prevent British forces from gaining a foothold in the Balkans and inciting other countries to join the war. Britain hoped to encourage Southern countries to join the war. Since taking office, I have paid special attention to ensuring that the country can become close to Germany through economic cooperation. During the World War, the city-state was an enemy of Germany, but Germany harbored no resentment. This time, I wanted to cooperate with the Southern country to mediate the Italo-Greek war. Turkey is an ally of Germany and has also suffered pain with Germany. Mussolini also strongly agreed to invite the Southern country to join the axis's peace front, offering various benefits and asking nothing in return from the Southern country. However, two days after the signing, conspirators suddenly launched a coup, greatly shocking us, while the British Prime Minister was very proud. Therefore, I immediately ordered an attack because Germany could not tolerate being treated in this way. Our allies Hungary and Bulgaria were equally indignant. On March 27th, when I ordered the attack, I knew that it would be extremely difficult to implement my order without the loyal cooperation of Hungary and Romania. April 6th was the date set for the attack. The German army's attack plan was: (1) One army would attack the Thrace province of Greece from Bulgaria, with Thessaloniki as the target. (2) One army would attack Skoplje in the Southern country and meet up with the Italian army in Albania. (3) The third army would depart from Niš, with Belgrade as the target. (4) The fourth army would attack from western Hungary, with Zagreb as the target. At the same time, Hungary and Italy were also asked to advance. The German army attacking Greece was led by Field Marshal List, and the army attacking the Southern country was commanded by Lieutenant General Weichs. Within twelve days, the Southern country surrendered. The areas of this operation were mountainous regions with strong defenses, which many believed were impassable for tank units. However, the German army was able to pass through unimpeded. Their determination to overcome difficulties is truly admirable. The achievements of the Air Force are truly amazing. In conclusion, from this campaign, we can say that nothing is impossible for the German military. Marching through sand, gravel, mud, broken bridges, damaged roads, and narrow mountain paths, being able to declare the end of military operations in both countries within six weeks is unprecedented. However, this was also achieved thanks to the assistance of our Italian and Hungarian allies."</p>
<p>Scolding Churchill Extensively</p>
<p>"Frankly speaking, among our enemies, the bravery of the Greek army is most admirable. I must again mention the culprit of this campaign, Churchill. Churchill is a liar who is best at distorting right and wrong, confusing falsehood with truth. Even the battles of Norway and Dunkirk can be twisted into British victories to deceive the world. What could be more shameless? If it were anyone else, they would have closed their doors to guests and be too ashamed to face people. The British troops landing in Greece numbered about 60,000 to 70,000, but Churchill claimed that there were 240,000 before the defeat, with the aim of attacking Germany from the south, hoping to turn defeat into victory as in 1918. Churchill later told the British people that 75,000 German soldiers died in this campaign. This was to cover up his failure and shirk responsibility to the people. As a result of this campaign, a total of 6,298 officers and 337,864 soldiers from the Southern country were captured, as well as 8,000 officers and 210,000 soldiers from the Greek army. The Greek soldiers have been released due to their bravery in battle. Over 9,000 British, Australian, and New Zealand soldiers were captured. The captured military equipment has not yet been fully counted, but there are approximately 500,000 rifles, over 1,000 cannons, and thousands of machine guns, anti-aircraft guns, and mortars, as well as various vehicles and countless ammunition. In addition, the Air Force sank 75 enemy ships, totaling 400,000 tons, and destroyed 147 ships, totaling 700,000 tons. The German army deployed a total of 31 full divisions and two and a half divisions, with only 11 infantry and mountain divisions, 6 Panzer divisions, motorized units, and three full stormtrooper divisions and two and a half divisions actually participating in the battle. Eleven divisions did not participate in the battle. Only two Panzer divisions and one mountain division engaged British, Australian, and New Zealand troops. The German losses were the lowest among all campaigns. The German officers and soldiers who died numbered 1,099, those wounded numbered 3,752, and those missing numbered 385. The Air Force had 52 deaths and 140 missing, which shows the high efficiency of German military training. Regarding the North African campaign, the so-called British victory allowed the German army to recover all lost territory in a very short period. If the British commander was in another country, he would have been handed over to a military court for sentencing. The results of this campaign have completely and permanently eliminated the tense factors in Europe. The important waterway of the Danube River is now safe. Germany has no territorial demands in Southeastern Europe and only wants to modify the borders drawn after the World War. Politically, we maintain peace; economically, we conduct bartering, so that all parties benefit. Various rights will be considered according to geography, history, and economics. Germany will cooperate as an observer in this arrangement. The desires of all allied countries can be fully satisfied. The establishment of the State of Croatia is something we are very pleased about. Hungary and Bulgaria, which suffered unjust treatment under the Treaty of Versailles, have now been restored. Italy has also obtained its territorial and political demands, which we are also pleased to see. We have the most sympathy for Greece because the ignorance of its King and a few leaders has caused the country to suffer a great disaster. The people of the Southern country will one day realize that the soldiers who launched the coup are a danger to the country."</p>
<p>Praising Superior Military Equipment</p>
<p>"This campaign shows the importance of soldier training and the benefits of superior military equipment. Both are indispensable. The duty of the German people is to serve the country to the best of their ability. German women who have not yet followed in the footsteps of their sisters working in farms and factories should strive to participate in this service and fulfill their natural duty. Germany will never experience the tragedy of 1918 again. Germany will maintain its superior military equipment. Regarding this, we should thank the workers of the entire country. Without their efforts, our plans could not be realized. Today, my confidence is even stronger because our allies have become an invincible force in economic, military, and moral terms. 1941 will be the greatest year of victory in German history. Germany's navy, land, and air forces will continue to fulfill their duties. The spiritual strength of the German people cannot be restrained by anyone. In this era of Jewish capitalism, an era of ostentation with money and class, the national socialist nation will stand as a monument to social justice for thousands of years."

<p>Scene at the German Congress</p>
<p>Berlin - The German Congress held a meeting yesterday at the Kroll Opera House. Many attendees wore field uniforms, and some wounded soldiers also attended. Among them were those who had received the Iron Cross and other medals for their wartime achievements. The balconies were also filled with soldiers, including several high-ranking officers from the army, navy, and air force. The diplomatic corps' seats were also full. Speaker Goering delivered the opening remarks, first paying tribute to the fallen soldiers such as Congressman Schwarz, and then inviting Chancellor Hitler to deliver a speech. When Hitler mentioned the small number of deaths and injuries in the Balkan campaign, all the members were deeply impressed. Hitler emphasized that Turkey was an ally of Germany during the last World War and that Turkey's recent policies have also been observing the situation from a practical standpoint. Hitler also praised the Greek people and the brave Greek soldiers. The members applauded frequently during Hitler's speech. After Hitler's speech, Goering declared that after the last Congress adjourned, the German army had launched a fierce attack on the British Isles. Germany has given severe retaliation to the enemy's attacks, and the British people are deeply pained. If Churchill welcomes this entertainment, it is his own business. If Churchill is excited after observing Plymouth, which has suffered bombing, we can guarantee to continue supplying stimulants to satisfy him. Finally, Goering praised Hitler's strategic genius, believing that the German army's achievements were due to Hitler's strategy. When the Congress adjourned, it was filled with emotions of support for Chancellor Hitler, and the entire body stood up and sang the German national anthem. (Haitong News Agency, April 5th)</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the European War (5) (1)</h3>
<p>Germany's Preparation for Total War</p>
<p>Total war is based on three concepts: detailed planning, sudden attacks, and concentrated power. Its main strategy lies in adopting a simple attack, with each action closely followed by another. This "war-sustaining war" strategy was originally commonly used by Napoleon, but Hitler innovated it, specializing in using the "evade the strong and attack the weak" tactic.</p>
<p>Former military science advocated "capture the king to capture the bandits first," believing that after the enemy's main force was defeated, the remaining troops would disintegrate accordingly. If one abandons the fundamental and pursues the superficial to attack weaknesses, it would only waste strength and would not fundamentally solve the war situation. This theory was applicable to former local wars, but it has become obsolete for total war.</p>
<p>For example, during the last European war, if the Allied forces had adopted a new strategy, then when the German army passed through Belgium to attack, they should have passed through Denmark to attack Germany, while the Russian army simultaneously launched a pincer attack on the Baltic Sea front. Later, it was too late to adopt this strategy.</p>
<p>The conquest strategy of totalitarian countries, with very few exceptions (such as in February 1942, when the Soviet Union miscalculated Finland's strength and launched a frontal attack on Vyborg), is monotonous. They all pre-arrange a series of grand plans and then wait for the opportunity to move. Each military action ends when public opinion in democratic countries reaches a boiling point. The targets they directly attack are so weak, defenseless, and even obviously remote places. From a military perspective, democratic countries must launch large-scale offensives to recapture a small outpost; from a political perspective, they must endure a long struggle to change an established fact.</p>
<p>As for Germany's new style of total war against France, it actually began seven years ago on the day the German Parliament was burned down. At that time, Hitler led the entire party, vocally opposing "Jewish Marxists" and the "Treaty of Versailles," and regarded France as a slave of both.</p>
<p>The beginning of total war can be seen as a product of the combination of the National Socialist Party and the German Army. German officers, generation after generation, regard military service as glorious. They constantly think about fighting at all times. It is said that General Schlieffen once accompanied his wife on a mountain tour, admiring the beautiful sunset. His wife exclaimed, "What a beautiful sight!"</p>
<p>"These mountains are not enough to hide from artillery fire, and this stream cannot be used as an obstacle. It is worthless militarily," Schlieffen replied.</p>
<p>The German Army has always avoided interfering in politics, and even when it participates, it is only a matter of acting on the occasion. They wholeheartedly only know how to implement the grand plans decided by the government. If the German government had implemented communism in 1933, the army would have already rejected National Socialism and attacked fascist Italy.</p>
<p>The German General Staff is the soul of the army. In peacetime, like the general staffs of other countries, they are constantly drafting various military plans to prepare for all possible wars. Staff talent is selected from active-duty soldiers, mostly from officers below the rank of field grade. The German Army's cultivation of new talent is unmatched by other countries.</p>
<p>After the officer training class is convened, it is divided into two groups, each led by a senior staff officer. One group represents the national general staff, and the other group represents the enemy general staff, studying military affairs separately. For example, if they are studying operations against France, they will be divided into German and French groups. Both sides have various intelligence about the forces of both countries. The German force is based on various records, while the French force is based on information from the military attaché of the embassy, secret reports from spies, and records from foreign newspapers.</p>
<p>These reports are extremely detailed, including everything from the number of combat divisions, the number of soldiers and machine guns in each division, the garrison location, the composition, morale, discipline, and combat effectiveness, just like the reports needed during wartime.</p>
<p>For example, during the last European war, when the first batch of American troops arrived in the Western Front, the German General Staff's record said that these were elite troops good at defensive warfare, but they often advanced rashly. The German army must use powerful units, deeply hidden in trenches and machine-gun positions, to wait for the opportunity to counterattack.</p>
<p>The German General Staff has special records for generals from various countries, explaining their unique personalities. They also have detailed reports on reserve divisions, mobilization locations, railway networks for deployment, sources of military supplies, and so on.</p>
<p>These two groups of German and French hypothetical general staffs plan attack strategies based on these reports. After the study is completed,</p>
<p>These trained officers return to their units, and another class is convened to continue the research.</p>
<p>Germany was originally the birthplace of military science. Experts had long understood the important role of the Maginot Line. This had a significant impact on Germany's initial war plans. The German General Staff had long known that after the Maginot Line was built, France's war plan had been completely overturned. Germany's entry into the Ruhr, military buildup in the Rhineland, and annexation of Austria would not be resisted by France. When Germany attacked Czechoslovakia, the General Staff could not guarantee that the French army would not launch a counterattack, but a counterattack might not be beneficial because Germany's Siegfried Line had been 10% completed in time.</p>
<p>Defensive warfare, in the eyes of the German army, is almost a false theory, except when used locally while an offensive war is underway elsewhere. Therefore, they also consider most military defenses to be false, with the exception of Britain, where the navy must determine the outcome.</p>
<p>In short, the German General Staff creates concrete strategies, simplifying complex issues, for any type of war. These strategies can be called "bag of tricks," ready to be implemented immediately upon hearing the signal. It is said that General Moltke was awakened from his sleep by the report of the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War and calmly instructed his men, "Open the third drawer in the cabinet over there. There is a small sealed bag inside, labeled 'War Plan No. 7'. Act accordingly." After saying this, he continued to sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>Hitler used troops everywhere in this European war, in Poland, in Norway, on the Western Front, and even in the Balkans, conquering everything he attacked, also completely relying on the General Staff's "bag of tricks."</p>

<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>The citizens hope the Shanghai Municipal Council will bring rice, like hoping for rain during a great drought. The audacity of the rice weevils and hoarding tigers has waned, and the price has returned to a little over five or six yuan. Foreign rice ships arrive in Shanghai one after another, and over 50,000 bags arrived yesterday.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has been transporting a fixed quantity of rice to Shanghai on a monthly basis to provide for the people's food supply, stabilize rice prices, and eliminate hoarding tigers. This is one of the most beneficial policies the Shanghai Municipal Council has implemented for the people in recent years. As far as we have heard and seen, the general wage-earning class, whether their salaries are hundreds or even tens of yuan, all deeply feel the pain of rice and grain being manipulated by a small number of rice worms and hoarding tigers. They eagerly await the Shanghai Municipal Council's rice to be available on the market as soon as possible to relieve the urgent needs of the citizens, truly like hoping for rain during a great drought. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council is extremely considerate to the rice merchants, fearing that it might hinder their livelihood. In reality, the stomachs of the rice merchants are all comfortably full. Therefore, the rice is still resold to rice shops through rice brokers, and from rice shops to consumers. It is stipulated that the price sold to rice brokers is 122 yuan and 91 cents per bag, then sold by the brokers to the rice shops for 133 yuan and 50 cents per bag, and then retailed by the rice shops to the consumers for 110 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). We believe that this price sold to brokers and shops already offers generous profits. However, with the rice merchants manipulating and hoarding to drive up prices, increasing several yuan per day, and making profits of 60 to 70 yuan per bag, they feel no interest whatsoever in the Shanghai Municipal Council's "fixed profit." Furthermore, it greatly impacts the rice they have hoarded. Not only can they not voice their grievances, but they also find it difficult to dispel their resentment. Therefore, they can only resort to "passive resistance" and not act as distributors. However, whether they distribute or not, the Shanghai Municipal Council's welfare undertakings are not only praised by 85% of Shanghai citizens, but also by the foreign residents of various countries who want to maintain the security of the Shanghai market. It must be maintained. It is only that it can be handled by the rice industry. On the other hand, citizens or legitimate professional organizations in the industrial and commercial sectors, as well as companies and firms, can also be permitted to purchase a considerable quantity under the investigation and supervision of the Shanghai Municipal Council, with the same treatment as rice shops, to ensure that it is truly for the consumption of their employees to reduce their burden and to guarantee that it will not be diverted for other purposes. In this way, the price can be reduced by about ten yuan per shi. This newspaper has also received two letters from citizens, who also have suggestions on this issue. They are disclosed below:</p>
<p>Yang Yongsheng's letter reads, "The May 3rd Shen Bao editorial '...The Shanghai Municipal Council has obtained the assistance of the Hong Kong government and can transport 20,000 to 25,000 tons of Xiaojiao rice to Shanghai every month for regulation...The focus from now on should be on how to distribute this rice and grain so that it can be fairly and affordably put into the hands of consumers. Since the rice industry has refused to distribute it, how should the Shanghai Municipal Council seek better sales methods?...Furthermore, the current price is 110 yuan per shi...Also, how to prevent the low-priced rice and grain from being repeatedly flowing into the hands of hoarders for their use...' After reading it, I deeply feel the enthusiasm of the Shanghai Municipal Council and people from all walks of life in caring for the people's food and benefiting the people. This is truly good news for the millions of compatriots on the isolated island. However, the issue of sales still requires discussion. If not handled properly, many drawbacks will arise. Moreover, this sale of rice is not like a relief sale, but seems to be of a regular nature. Therefore, the Shen Bao editorial also said, 'The Shanghai Municipal Council should also do its best to find ways to prevent this rice and grain from being interrupted due to any accidents and must continue to be supplied continuously to benefit the people.' Therefore, it should also be handled with a long-term approach. In my opinion, under these circumstances, the people should automatically organize a rice and grain consumer cooperative to purchase directly from the Xiangmao and Liji foreign firms designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council. The selling price should be the market price, and the profits obtained, after deducting legitimate expenses, should be distributed according to the amount of consumption of the members. Members must use vouchers to buy rice from the cooperative. The household population of the members should be investigated first, and then given according to the number of people (for example, if member A is a family of five, they can buy three sheng of rice per day, and so on). Only in this way can the hoarders be prevented from taking advantage, and the members can also get real benefits. In my opinion, the meaning of cooperation is to eliminate all exploitation. Under the current situation of the isolated island, this kind of organization is an urgent matter. However, this matter is of great importance and requires the efforts of everyone to proceed step by step. There must be many comrades in Shanghai who agree. If you agree, please do not hesitate to give your advice."</p>
<p>Zhu Wenzhai's letter reads, "Dear Editor, Respectfully, I have read your newspaper's third-day editorial, and every word is accurate, and I admire it very much. Wenzhai has been engaged in the grain industry for many years, carrying out transportation and sales. I am delighted to hear that the Shanghai Municipal Council is regulating Shanghai's food supply to relieve the people's difficulties. It has been publicly announced, but the registration method of Liji Foreign Firm is limited to wholesale rice shops and retail rice shops. Although this measure is good, it is still not perfect. May I ask, how can the brokers sacrifice their own interests? Therefore, to achieve widespread coverage, we must seek people in the rice industry who are willing to serve the public and assign them to the task. I believe that among the many large rice merchants in Shanghai, are they all of the same ilk? It is a pity that no one is advocating for it. May I ask your newspaper to publicly solicit cooperative technical personnel, 'such as those who can handle the delivery and handover,' and I believe there will be no shortage of them. However, Liji still has a balance of Hong Kong rice. You can try to apply for Hong Kong rice registration and gather successful people before making a decision. For the issue of deposit money for orders, you can designate a bank to collect it to show fairness and credibility. I dare to believe that things are done by people. If you can handle widespread registration, then the people will benefit immensely. As far as I can see, I still want to ask for detailed instructions, and I would be very fortunate."</p>
<p>The sharp drop in the price of foreign rice yesterday was no less than the previous rise. The increase the day before was excessive, so there should be a severe correction today. However, the current high price of 140 to 150 yuan may not be able to stand firm. The benchmark price for the flat sale of Hong Kong rice is only 110 yuan. The standard price for Vietnamese rice in the future may have to be lower than this 110 yuan. Therefore, no one will naturally be interested in rice that is 30 to 40 yuan more expensive on the market. Unless they have enough brains to reduce prices and sell early to recover their capital and profits, otherwise, they will not be able to eat that much themselves. They can only let it dry in the wind, steam in the water, be eaten by insects and mold, and suffer losses in all aspects. It is even possible that they will try to steal a chicken but lose the rice used to bait it, which is also unpredictable. When the early market opened, due to the flat sale of Hong Kong rice at 110 yuan, people were unusually apprehensive, and those who stirred up trouble were also unable to be active due to the market's reformed trading methods. Furthermore, the environment was unfavorable to buyers. Although the large households still tried to make a final struggle, the many floating small households had to reduce prices and sell as soon as possible. Therefore, all stalls were selling off, especially Xiaojiao Saigon, Mindang, and broken rice. Saigon No. 1 fell from 150 yuan to 145 yuan, Xiaojiao fell from 142 yuan to 135 yuan, Mindang fell from 140 yuan to 135 yuan, and broken rice fell from 115 yuan to 104 yuan. Compared to Saturday, all fell by about seven or eight yuan to ten yuan. However, after the price fell, the owners were unwilling to sell again due to cost considerations, and the floating households and retail customers had already bought at low prices. Therefore, the afternoon market rose again by three to five yuan. However, in this situation of a large fall and a small rebound, the closing market was still weak and lifeless. No. 1 Saigon was 148 yuan, No. 2 was 144 yuan, Mindang was 140 yuan, and Xiaojiao was 140 and 139 yuan. In total, there was a total drop of five or six yuan after one rise and one fall. The turnover was less than 7,000 bags. Yinghua Company opened 500 tons of broken rice at 136 yuan, also down about ten yuan.</p>
<p>Although domestic rice such as Houbo and Geng still had smooth arrivals, everyone was apprehensive due to the sharp and special sale of foreign rice. Retail sales in the hometown stores suddenly stagnated, and the owners, wanting to avoid huge losses, had to reduce prices to attract customers. Therefore, during the period of the most severe price drops in the central market, it was similar to foreign rice and also fell by about ten yuan. Houbo only opened at 151 yuan and 150 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice were 145 and 146 yuan. However, when it was heard that foreign rice was tightening up again, it also rose again accordingly. Therefore, the result was that Ruoxi Geng was 153 and 154 yuan, Kun Geng was 151 and 152 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice were 148 yuan. According to statistics, the city as a whole had one fall and one rise, with a total drop of about six or seven yuan. As for glutinous rice and glutinous green rice, they were still not available. In short, this price drop was really due to the Shanghai Municipal Council's flat-priced rice, which caused this situation. We applaud the future of the people's food supply. Looking back at the past rice market, since the Geng Hong market this year, it has been under the monopoly and manipulation of hoarders all the way, so that rice prices have been rising every day. After accumulating for days and months, we have finally seen a glimmer of dawn. I hope that the authorities will continue unabated, and the price of rice in the future will definitely have a day when the clouds clear and the sun shines, and the people of Shanghai will be freed from their suffering.</p>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice are arriving continuously. The Taikoo Company's Anhui ship transported 21,186 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and arrived on the 4th, berthed at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong to unload onto the warehouse. Also, the Jinan ship arrived in Shanghai on the 4th, also transporting a large batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong, totaling 15,279 bags, berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload onto the warehouse. Jardine Matheson's Yusheng ship also arrived on the 4th, transporting a large batch of foreign rice totaling 14,080 bags, and another 1,964 bags of corn, berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The three ships brought a total of more than 50,000 bags of foreign rice, and there is no doubt that there is a sufficient supply of foreign rice. The Taikoo Company's warehouse is already full, so the foreign rice transported by the company's recent ships are all stored in other warehouses. This is enough to prove the abundance of rice storage. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Unable to Support and Rebounds Slightly</h3>
<p>Foreign flour first stabilized and then fell, which is contrary to the trend of last Saturday. It was found that the market was calm when the market opened in the morning, and Jinlong brand Kan flour opened at 33 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen, and Huaniao brand Australian flour opened at 34 yuan and 1 jiao, only slightly weaker by one or two jiao. In the afternoon, the situation suddenly became unsustainable. Because the rice market plummeted, the authorities were determined to maintain the people's food supply, and the number of international shipping vessels could gradually increase after this, and the source of foreign goods was smooth, people's hearts were quite weak, so the Kan and Australian flours in the after-market were each lower by three, four, or five jiao, etc. However, the transaction was suppressed and was extremely dull. Hua factory's flat-priced flour continued to be supplied by Fuxin factory with more than 5,000 bags, the price was 29 yuan, plus miscellaneous expenses of 5 jiao per bag, which was distributed by the designated merchants. Today, there are 1,000 bags of flour, loaded onto Taikoo Company's Yuezhou ship to be transported to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The domestic wheat market had already stopped and there was no market, because the old wheat prices dropped, and both supply and demand were silent. Foreign wheat arrivals were made into flour by Hua factories specifically for flat sales, and were also not entering or exiting the market. The Japanese factories' over-the-counter purchases were also intermittent, and there was generally no regular market, so the market remained stalled as usual.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes/Bean Cakes Experience Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bean cake market situation first carried on the weakness of last Saturday. The opening price was low, and it once dropped by six or seven jiao. Later, there were many who took advantage of the cheap price to pick up profits, and it rebounded, and then pressed down again. As a result, there were mutual discrepancies. According to statistics, 1,000 pieces of Kai Li Zi cake were made, and the price was 10 yuan. Yuanren cake's contract for 2,000 pieces to be delivered in the lower half of May was 20 yuan and 6 jiao. Xing Ji cake's price for delivery in the upper half of May was 21 yuan and 7 jiao to 22 yuan, and the price for delivery in the lower half of May was 22 yuan and 2 jiao to 23 yuan and 1 jiao. The closing price was 22 yuan and 9 jiao. The upper half of June was 23 yuan to 23 yuan and 5 jiao. The closing price was 23 yuan and 3 jiao and a half. The total turnover was 32,400 pieces.</p>
<p>240 bags of soybeans were exported to Xiamen on the 6th, and 955 bags were exported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance, Chinese Merchants Continuously Sell Foreign Exchange at a Premium</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate for each exchange was not changed. The gray market for British and American exchange rates was steady and continued to be slightly looser. This was because the price of gold was weak, and Chinese speculators threw out more than 200,000 yuan of American exchange. HSBC and Dao Heng and other Hong Kong telegraphs had quite some intention to buy. The Japanese bank and Chinese banks also supplied them one after another, so the US dollar was 5.1875 yuan, which could be given as soon as June. British gold was three offices and 2.21875 yuan. By noon, the slack was slightly rebounded. In the afternoon, Chinese merchants continued to cover the shortage, Hong Kong telegraphs came out again, and the price of gold fell slightly faster. The price gradually hardened until the late close. The British exchange rate was long 0.015625, totaling three offices and 2.21875 yuan. The US dollar was long 0.03125, totaling 5.1875 yuan. There was quite a lot of trading.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong gang's receipts turned stable.</p>
<p>Since the morning, there has been no market for British and American silver prices. Indian silver continued to rise. The exchange rate of each country rose by two points against Shanghai, and the rest remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchanges were unchanged. At the opening of the domestic market, the selling price of spot British exchange rate by banks was three offices and 2.03125 yuan, and the US dollar was 5.15625 yuan. Speculators coming to cover the next month's US dollar at 5.1875 yuan were difficult to sell and could be settled. Afterwards, Dao Heng and other Hong Kong telegraphs came to collect and absorb it, and it began to turn stable. The HSBC listing did not change any of the exchanges. After the silver balancing tax was still levied at 24.50%, speculators still continued to sell non-stop. Chinese banks and Japanese banks successively spat out US dollars for May and June at 5.1875 yuan, most of which were absorbed by HSBC and other banks. The situation stabilized at noon. The noon closing price for British gold was three offices and 2.03125 yuan, and some were still three offices and 2.21875 yuan. Only the spot US dollar for June was 5.187, and the current month was 5.15625 yuan.</p>
<p>Both British and American currencies saw a lengthening.</p>

<h3>The Large Empty Account Movement: The Gold Market Has Been Pressed Down Without Being Lifted Up: The Current Price Is Weaker and Scraped More Than Fifty Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for gold futures continued to weaken, and the price had broken into the 6,700 yuan mark. This was because it inherited the fatigue of the previous weekend, the foreign exchange rate loosened, and people's hearts were even softer. Empty positions rose in all directions to increase their bets, which was caused by the activity. Under the selling pressure from the Silver Shop Gang (Zhongxing), the Securities House (Yida Defu increased their bets and massively flipped to empty), the Draft Bank (Dafeng increased their bets), and the Silver Number Gang (Hengji increased their bets) one after another, most retail investors were short, with pressure but no lifting, causing the price to show a trend of large drops and small rebounds. From the opening price of 6,710 yuan in the morning, it gradually decreased to a low price of 6,665 yuan before the late close, eventually continuing to fall by 39 yuan. The total transaction was about 25,000 to 6,000 liang. The current gold price was even weaker, first sold by Shihe to the Silver Shop Gang for 50 liang, the price was 110 yuan higher than the forward price, and then Yongcheng (Yongfengyu) sold to Xianghe for 200 liang, and Xiangxing Yong Yang Qinghe Baocheng, etc., a total of more than 100 liang, the price was 100 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Taikang Run sold 100 liang to Shunyuan, the price was 105 yuan higher, about scraping more than 50 yuan. The jewelry gold also decreased by 5 yuan, retreated to the 700 yuan mark, and Guan Jin, etc., were all flat.</p>
<p>The futures fell forty yuan weak</p>
<p>Since the opening of the market at 9:15 a.m. every bar (ten liang), it was 6,710 yuan, which was the same as the closing price of last Saturday. The Silver Shop Gang Zhongxing came to sell fiercely, and Yida Dafeng Chida also sold, and it was immediately seen that it retreated outside the 6,700 yuan, falling 24 yuan, and retreated to 6,686 yuan. At that time, Yida resumed its advance, and Tianyuan Hengji both bought, and it was seen to be lifted up. Tongkang Yong also turned to sell and bought, and at 9:50 a.m., it rose to 6,705 yuan. After being vigorously sold by Defu, it was seen to fall below to 6,685 yuan. Later, between 6,691 and 3 yuan, the noon closing price was 6,691 yuan. The market opened at 2 p.m. at 6,692 yuan. Following a slight lift, all 6,699 yuan, the securities house Defu Yida Chida and Dafeng Hengji, etc., successively spat out and sold, and the foreign exchange rate was stable and strong, and after being fiercely pressed by retail investors, the price gradually decreased by more than 30 yuan, falling to 6,665 yuan, which was bought by Xinfeng Yong Da. The closing price at 4 p.m. was 6,671 yuan, 39 yuan lower than the noon closing price on last Saturday.

There was a difference of 45 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current gold of the cash number was 120 yuan higher than the futures trading price of the futures, and the purchase was 60 to 70 yuan lower than the sale.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>National Debt Stalemated</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for the national debt gray market were still hovering and sluggish. The difference between the high and low prices was no more than two or three jiao. Various gangs watched each other with their arms folded, all expecting future changes. Such repeated brewing, the longer the time, the greater the changes, which cannot be taken lightly. The United States loan agreement was signed, and the debt market did not rise due to feeling it. The loss of the war in eastern Zhejiang, the debt market did not fall due to feeling it. Therefore, the current smooth progress of the war in eastern Zhejiang, the market also does not feel the joy or sorrow. The reason for its numbness is still that the long and short positions are firmly fixed, the short side thinks that the opportunity can be taken advantage of, and the long side has abundant mobile funds. The two sides are equally matched, and even held on tightly, leading to a path of hovering and brewing. The stalemate in the future is still difficult to break. It was heard that yesterday's transactions, the morning was bought by Dunyu and retail investors, and sold by Runli and Lianyi. In the afternoon, Shunchang Xie Xingyuan bought, and Lianhe and Lianyi sold. The market price rose and fell between two or three jiao, and the result was still that high and low prices were seen, and the trend was still sluggish. The turnover was about one million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Co., Ltd. were traded at a price of 24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Actual Sales Clear, Margin Drops: Double Horse Still Being Lifted: Miscellaneous Brands of Yarn Fail to Follow: Selling Price Pulled Away Two Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the situation was still tight. This was because the public's psychology was optimistic, so the current situation was still in a state of more entries than exits. The situation wanted to fall but rose. However, the foreign exchange rate was loose, and the margin trended down. Because of this, those who made profits had some exports. They still could not break through the 600 yuan mark for the rice market. In fact, the sales of current yarn were not as prosperous as in the past. In addition, the miscellaneous brands of yarn failed to follow up on the progress. 20 counts of Shuangdiqiu could not sell for 1,355 yuan, and the price difference with Shuangma was as huge as 230 yuan. 20 counts of Danu sold for only 1,400 yuan, also pulled away 180 yuan. In such a situation, Shuangma would indirectly be affected. The high price for 20 counts of Shuangma was 1,584 yuan, and the low price was 1,563 yuan. The initial transaction in the afternoon was 1,581 yuan, and it rose to 1,586 yuan. After that, it was heard that the margin gradually fell, the selling wind was more intense, and it fell to 1,574 yuan. The final price was 1,575.6 yuan. Today, six pieces of cotton yarn were transported to Xiamen, and 18 pieces were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Cotton Factory Stomach Movement</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still in a calm state, but people's hearts are good. Most of the people say that the situation in the Pacific is urgent, and there may be problems with the source of goods in the future, so the majority are optimistic. Today, 50 bales of cotton were transported to Hong Kong. Yesterday, the factories and firms made a total of 1,200 pieces, and the price rose by one or two yuan. The market prices are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>399 Brazilian cotton Shenxin No. 2 Factory sent 300 pieces to the factory</p>

<h3>Grain Transport in Hong Kong and Shanghai has Announced Joint Control: Starting Next Month, the Hong Kong Government has Exclusive Rights: All Rice and Grain Transported to Shanghai is Handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Council: The Price of Rice Finally Saw a Fall Yesterday, and it is Expected to Fall Another Twenty Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday it was widely rumored that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council of the French Concession, in order to stabilize the food supply of Shanghai citizens, in addition to adopting the same steps, respectively ordering a large amount of cheap foreign rice from overseas rice-producing areas to transport to Shanghai for regulation, now in order to implement the original intention, starting from the 10th of this month, the price of rice in the two concessions will be restricted, that is, the maximum price per stone will be 110 yuan, and it must not be deliberately increased. Otherwise, the citizens who buy and sell rice can report to the authorities, so that they can be investigated and dealt with according to the law. However, the authorities of the two concessions have not yet issued a formal communiqué on the matter.</p>
<p>French Municipal Council's Procurement Plan</p>
<p>In order to make the outside world understand the general situation of the French Municipal Council's food planning, it specially invited news reporters from the Chinese newspapers and news agencies in Shanghai to the Superintendent's office of the Council on Avenue Joffre at 4 p.m. yesterday. On the spot, Superintendent Ding Gu published information on the food problem, saying that in order to strictly manage the rice market, the Council had previously taken appropriate steps and initiated the establishment of a Food Management Committee, which has been in operation for eight months. It has cooperated a lot with the Public Concession Food Management Committee. However, the current food panic is getting worse. The Council is planning to purchase a large amount of foreign rice from Vietnam and other places and transport it to Shanghai. At that time, it will be sold at a low price. However, the vessels and water fees are still under negotiation. The Council is now focusing all its attention on this issue so that it can be realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson and Taikoo are Responsible for Transporting Rice</p>
<p>The first batch of cheap Xiaojiao rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession may arrive here around the beginning of this month, and will arrive separately thereafter. Regarding the transportation, the Shanghai Municipal Council has now reached an agreement with the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies, and the two shipping companies will subsequently take full responsibility for loading the cheap Hong Kong rice. Regarding various procedures, the authorities have also entrusted Liji and other two foreign firms to handle them. According to inquiries with Liji Foreign Firm, (1) Several grain firms in the city have signed a contract with the foreign firm for more than 10,000 bags of Rangoon rice. When the Shanghai Municipal Council decided on this rice transportation plan, it advised the grain and rice industry to purchase it, but it was rejected. Now that it is certain that the rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council will arrive in Shanghai for sale around the 15th of this month, if they do not order it as soon as possible, they will not be able to obtain this legal profit. They have to change their attitude. (2) Rice shops in the city have been in contact with the firm to undertake sales in recent days, with a total of about 10,000 bags. However, most of them are small rice shops, and the large rice shops are still watching, because they have hoarded a lot and cannot sell it off for a while. (3) Householders in the city have also been ordering from the foreign firm in recent days. However, in order to take into account the business of legitimate rice shops, the firm politely requested residents to order from the rice shops. If the price, weight, and composition are inconsistent with the regulations of the authorities, the foreign firm can send personnel to investigate. (4) This Hong Kong rice is 40-count Xiaojiao rice, which is exactly the same quality as the 140 yuan per stone sold on the market today. It is by no means the Xiaojiao broken rice that is rumored outside.</p>
<p>The price of rice finally saw a drop yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the rice market opened for business, it still traded according to the original method. Although the order was chaotic and disorganized, people's hearts were extremely tired. The prices of rice at each stall tended to go downstream at the beginning of the market, and those who hoarded the goods all reduced the prices of a large amount of rice to seek sales, but the rice shops' acceptance was very tired, and the market situation was quite different from before. As a result, the price of rice fell by about four yuan per stone compared with the previous market. The market once fell sharply by more than nine yuan yesterday morning. This was the first major drop in more than three months. Responsible people claimed that after the rice price fell this morning, it is expected that the rice price will soon fall sharply again. After the rice price trended down this morning, it is expected that it will fall another 20 yuan. The first batch of Vietnamese rice handled by the French authorities is expected to arrive in Shanghai within two weeks.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Fifth Festival: The Entire City Celebrates with Flags, All Sectors Follow the Revolutionary Personality of the Founding Father to Rescue the Nation from Crisis</h3>
<p>Yesterday, on the "May Fifth" Festival, the anniversary of the establishment of the revolutionary government with Sun Yat-sen, the Founding Father, assuming the position of Extraordinary President, all sectors of the city, in accordance with the methods negotiated by various public groups and the concession authorities, uniformly celebrated by raising flags, with extreme enthusiasm. In the tenth year of the Republic [1921], the national situation was precarious, with internal warlords rampant and external powers coveting, making it seem impossible to survive. The Founding Father, disregarding the dangers of the environment, resolutely assumed the post of Extraordinary President on May 5th, continuing to shoulder the great cause of the revolution. This marked the establishment of the revolutionary government. All sectors, taking the Founding Father's resolute assumption of the office of Extraordinary President at that time, his uncompromising stance, and his fearlessness of difficulty as examples, which laid the foundation for the subsequent oath to launch the Northern Expedition and stabilize the entire country, decided during this national crisis, at a time when the entire country is striving, to emulate the revolutionary personality of the Founding Father, to not shirk any hardships and difficulties, and to strive forward to rescue the nation from crisis and complete the rejuvenation of the nation.</p>
<h3>Coal Ball and Flour Prices Still Controlled by Hoarders, Coal Merchants Still Attempting to Speculate and Raise Prices, Flour Prices Hold Firm, Noodle Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Since both rice and coal balls have repeatedly increased in price, citizens' food expenses have greatly increased. Now, the rice problem has been planned by the Public Works Department and the Board of Directors, and Hong Kong rice can arrive at the port for distribution, and the situation has changed. However, the fuel item is still tightly controlled by hoarders. For example, a certain coal ball factory has 2,000 tons of warehouse receipts that cannot be recovered, so coal prices have plummeted. Moreover, it is rumored that the coal industry is secretly discussing adding 40 yuan per ton to white coal and 18 yuan per load to coal balls. This has not been implemented temporarily due to the long-term foreign exchange. The authorities should pay attention to this and suppress it in advance to prevent it from becoming a reality. Moreover, flour prices are also affected by hoarders. Although it was proven yesterday that 200,000 bags of American flour were shipped to Shanghai, the price only fell by about 2 yuan, which shows that hoarders have not let go of the flour, resulting in rising prices for all kinds of noodles. The only economical food for the poor (pancakes and fried dough sticks) has increased from 3 cents to 5 cents. Although it was once reduced due to the increase in flour prices, it was still sold at the original price. Now, it is also affected by other commodity prices, so the guild announced that it will be sold for 10 cents per piece from yesterday (but most have not implemented it). Others, such as soup, have increased from 3 cents to 5 cents, and bowl noodles have increased by 50% to 100%. Congee has increased from 5 cents to 8 cents, glutinous rice cakes have increased from 5 cents to 10 cents, soy milk has increased from 5 cents to 7 cents, and bowl rice in restaurants has increased by 50%. In fact, all kinds of food have increased in price. The Moore Memorial Church's flat-rate white rice has also increased its price again yesterday, selling for 30 cents per catty.</p>
<p>Officially Announces Joint Control</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times quoted a Hong Kong telegram from the Allied News Agency on the 4th, saying that the Hong Kong government officially announced yesterday that it has exclusive rights over all rice imports and exports from June 1st. The gazette on the exclusive rights plan stated that the rice situation in Hong Kong and Shanghai has not been satisfactory in the past few months, and speculative activities are rampant. Rice profiteers are insatiable and cannot be fully controlled. Only the joint control of the two authorities can prevent consumers of rice from being exploited as much as possible. It is obvious that the Hong Kong government and the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department have agreed on a method for this purpose, stipulating that rice transported to the Shanghai Public Concession should be handed over to the Public Works Department, so the department will now directly transport these rice grains and distribute them to retailers. Because rice prices in Hong Kong are extremely high, and the future supply of rice is uncertain, and there are fewer and fewer ships, the Hong Kong government plans to exclusively manage the import and export of all rice after the expiration of the current rice import license on May 31. Exclusive management is only a wartime measure, but it may be necessary to continue it for some time after the end of the war. In the past few years, Thailand's rice harvest has been relatively small, and obtaining rice from other places on a regular basis is not certain. Therefore, the rice consumed and transported out of Hong Kong must be obtained from Myanmar as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Spring Cocoons Cannot Be Opened for Sale, Silk Mills Dismantle Machines and Stop Reeling, Some Silk Mills Are Converted into Other Factories, Spring Cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Are All Controlled by Japanese Merchants</h3>
<p>Spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are about to be listed on the market. Due to the control of the China Silk Company, silk cocoon manufacturers are prevented from setting up branches to purchase them. Silk mills in the Shanghai Public Concession have been forced to stop their machines due to the exhaustion of raw materials, and the cocoon collection plan cannot be carried out due to the control of Japanese merchants. Spring cocoons in eastern Zhejiang cannot be transported to Shanghai due to transportation difficulties. The silk industry in Shanghai is on the verge of extinction.</p>
<p>Listing Dates of Spring Cocoons in Various Places</p>
<p>(1) Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area: Hangzhou, May 23; Haining, May 24; Jiaxing, May 25; Huzhou, May 26; Xiaoshao area: Sheng County, May 18; Xinchang, May 20; Xiaoshan, May 22; Shaoxing, May 23. (2) Jiangsu Province, Suzhou-Changzhou area: Yixing, May 28; Suzhou, May 29; Liyang, May 29; Jintan, May 29; Changzhou, May 30; Xichang area: Wuxi, May 31; Jiangyin, June 1; Changshu, June 1. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the listing of spring cocoons generally starts in mid-May and ends in early June, lasting only about two weeks.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Stop Buying Spring Cocoons</p>
<p>In the past, spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang often had a great impact on the financial market in Shanghai. When spring cocoons were listed, a large amount of cash flowed from Shanghai to the inland, which was enough to cause the Shanghai foreign exchange rate to rise and the money supply to tighten. This year, however, is different. The Shanghai silver and money industry has refused to provide loans for cocoon collection in the occupied areas, and silk factory merchants and remaining cocoon merchants regard cocoon collection as a daunting task. Therefore, although spring cocoons are about to be listed, there is no organization or company going to collect them. As a result, silk factories in the Shanghai Public Concession have stopped their machines due to the exhaustion of raw materials, and the resumption of operations is far away. Moreover, some silk factories have dismantled their silk reeling machines and converted them into other factories.</p>
<p>Silkworms Sell Local Silk</p>
<p>Small family silk factories in the inland, which were newly established after the war to avoid Japanese merchant control, now have a maximum of 40 silk reeling machines. The silk reeled is sold to various silk weaving factories. At this time when spring cocoons are about to be listed, they are going to various guerrilla areas where Japanese military power cannot reach to purchase them. It is also heard that silkworm farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are unwilling to sell the cocoons they have harvested to the control agencies, and they are reeling the cocoons into local silk themselves for sale. However, the control agencies are suppressing cocoon prices and forcibly buying them, so silkworm farmers are complaining constantly. It is also heard that some silkworm farmers have transported cocoons to eastern Zhejiang for sale.</p>

<h3>The Fang Dan Case: Continued Hearing Tomorrow, Judgment to Be Delivered After Arguments from Both Sides</h3>
<p>The Fang Dan case, in which four Chinese landowners in Shanghai sued the Public Works Department, will continue to be heard at the Consular Court here at 2:30 p.m. this Wednesday (the 7th). At that time, the British Consul-General and President of the Consular Court George, the American Consul-General Lockehead, and the Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi will listen to the arguments from both sides and then announce the judgment. The case involves a wide range of issues and affects the Public Works Department's tax revenue of approximately one million yuan per year. The title deeds of such properties are old Fang Dans that are more than 100 years old. Under the Land Regulations of the Public Concession, the tax issue of such properties has never been satisfactorily resolved. The case was initially heard by Lang, the Secretary of the Consular Body, for nearly two months. During the hearings, the lawyers from both sides had many "fierce" debates.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu Zuoting Leaves Shanghai for Recuperation</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, Yu Zuoting, a financial magnate in the silver and money industry, left Shanghai last month for recuperation. According to people close to Yu, Yu will not return to Shanghai for a short period of time after leaving Shanghai for recuperation.</p>
<h3>American Nationals Decide to Hold a Gathering to Commemorate Mother's Day, Hold a Dinner Party to Entertain Soldiers, Mrs. O is Named Honorary Mother</h3>
<p>Next Sunday (the 11th) is Mother's Day. The American active duty soldiers and American nationals in Shanghai will hold a gathering as usual to commemorate the occasion. At that time, a dinner party will be held at noon in the social room of the American Church in Shanghai. The American nationals will be the hosts and the American soldiers will be the guests. It is agreed that the gathering can be informal. It is estimated that 120 people will attend the gathering, half of whom will be soldiers and the other half will be civilians. Mrs. O is appointed as the honorary mother and will give a brief speech at the gathering. During the dinner, Reverend Cullen of the 4th Marine Regiment will lead the prayer, and Private Trapper will deliver a speech to the guests on behalf of the soldiers. At the same time, the 4th Marine Regiment Band will play various songs suitable for Mother's Day.</p>
<h3>French Concession Garbage Workers, Bureau Hopes to Resume Work, Chief Inspector Ding Gutiti Announces the Reasons for the Strike</h3>
<p>At 4 p.m. yesterday, the French Municipal Council invited more than a dozen news reporters from Shanghai newspapers. Inspector Ding Gutiti of the Municipal Council made the following statement:</p>
<p>Garbage Cleaners Suddenly Went on Strike</p>
<p>The strike of the garbage workers in the French Concession occurred at 2 a.m. on the 27th of last month. All the garbage trucks had already driven out when a group of workers stopped working and abandoned their trucks. Soon after, the entire workforce responded. Upon investigation, this unfortunate incident occurred without any prior demands or petitions. The Bureau was completely unaware of it beforehand. In order to safeguard the welfare of the residents in the Concession, the Municipal Council temporarily hired White Russian workers to clear the garbage. In order to understand the workers' difficulties, they were allowed to resume work unconditionally. Most of the workers have resumed work one after another. Unexpectedly, when wages were distributed last Saturday, a small number of workers were dissatisfied with the deduction of wages during the strike period and threw stones at other workers. Therefore, some of them continued the strike. In order to be fair, the Bureau had to deduct the wages of the striking workers during the strike period, because the workers who drove the garbage trucks had never joined the strike.</p>
<p>The Bureau Still Hopes to Work as Usual</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ding, there are 2,200 Chinese employees in the entire French Concession, including 1,200 to 1,500 workers. Only 380 of them continued the strike this time. The authorities still hope that they will join the work. So far, no one has been fired. However, anyone who wants to resign is free to do so. The entire savings under the monthly wages are allowed to be withdrawn. As for the wages, the first 55 people who initiated the stoning and caused trouble were detained in the police station. The lowest-level workers under the Municipal Council had a monthly salary of 17 yuan in 1937, which has now increased to 100 to 130 yuan. The drivers were paid 40 yuan before, and now they are paid 162.78 yuan. As for other employees, they were paid 91 yuan before, and now they are paid 287 yuan. In addition, there is a monthly rice subsidy, which was 45 yuan in March, increased to 55 yuan last month, and is expected to increase to 66 yuan this month. The rice subsidy is calculated based on the rice price on the 15th of each month. The workers' unreasonable demands for wage increases will only increase the burden on the taxpayers in the Concession. The two sides not only did not hold a meeting, but the Bureau did not take any steps.</p>

<h3>New U.S. Cargo Ship Maiden Voyage to Shanghai, Carrying a Large Amount of U.S. Goods, The Alava Scheduled to Berth This Afternoon, Two Ships Will Arrive in Shanghai Every Month Thereafter</h3>
<p>The Alava, the newest type of U.S. cargo ship, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning on its maiden voyage directly from Seattle, USA, passing through Vancouver, Havana, San Francisco, and Honolulu without stopping. This time it carries a large amount of U.S. goods, which will be unloaded in Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the war in Europe by the United Kingdom, the Far East voyages of U.S. ships have decreased. U.S. cargo ships will gradually replace them. Another new ship, the New Frantley, is also scheduled to sail from Seattle to Shanghai in mid-May to join the Shanghai-U.S. route. The above two ships are now managed by the Shanghai Fraley &amp; Co., Ltd. and operate between Seattle, Portland, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Little Luzon. The Alava is the first of the new-style cargo ships built by the American Mail Line. It has a deadweight of 7,900 tons and a speed of 14 knots per hour after loading. It is reported that more U.S. cargo ships will be added to the Eastern route one after another, with one cargo ship arriving in Shanghai every half month. According to a reporter from New Voice News Agency, Collinsworth, Stardie, and Coltbrock will also serve Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Seattle at the same time.</p>
<h3>Changshou Pharmaceutical Factory Held Founding Meeting Yesterday, Elected Directors, Supervisors, and Managers</h3>
<p>Lan Ting and other elders in Shanghai initiated the establishment of Changshou Pharmaceutical Factory Co., Ltd. with a capital of 100,000 yuan, which has been fully raised. At 1 p.m. yesterday, the founding meeting was held at the Bankers Club. Mr. Wen Lanting served as chairman, first reporting the purpose of the establishment, and then passing the company's articles of association and electing directors and supervisors. The directors include Wen Lanting, Wu Yunqi, Wang Weiqing, Zhou Ruihua, Huang Yantang, Chuan Longcai, Wu Leqin, Chen Youyun, and Tao Zikang. The supervisors include He Wuliang, Luo Lican, Gui Jinlong, Liu Zhifang, and Li Xiuzhang. The board of directors appointed Jiang Yiqiu as manager, and Han Jingqi and Zhu Bocheng as deputy managers. It is reported that the company will be opened soon.</p>
<h3>Visitors from Ningbo Talk About the Recent Situation in Ningbo</h3>
<p>Since the traffic between Ningbo was cut off, the news was extremely isolated. All the fellow villagers in Shanghai were very concerned. Recently, I met a gentleman who had just arrived in Shanghai last night and learned about the recent situation. According to him, he disembarked from Longshan on the evening of April 28 and traveled through the mountains, Datuan, and Shizhu to reach Shanghai, a journey of three days. The shops in Sanbei are open as usual. However, it is heard that a fire was accidentally caused by residents in Fangjiahetou, burning down 30 to 40 houses. A carpenter's workshop outside Ximen also caught fire, but it was immediately extinguished and did not cause a major disaster. As for Ningbo City, tap water, electric lights, etc. are still the same as before. The large shops on Dongda Road and Xida Road have resumed business. The telephone bureau, post office, and other agencies have also resumed operations. However, there are 40,000 to 50,000 refugees who are suffering from the war and have insufficient food reserves, making relief difficult. They are struggling to survive and are waiting to be fed, which is very pitiful. Although local groups are trying their best to provide relief, it is ultimately a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that fellow villagers in Shanghai will do their best to help and relieve the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Sacred Tree Transplanted to Jueyuan</h3>
<p>The Bodhi tree under which Sakyamuni attained Buddhahood 2,500 years ago was transplanted to Ceylon by Ashoka King in 288 BC. In 1935, Venerable Narada again divided the seedlings of this tree and brought them to China, giving them to the Jueyuan Pure Land Society. This year, Ceylonese layman Hui Luopuli donated funds to rebuild the new altar. The Society respectfully held a transplant ceremony yesterday (on the morning of Buddha's Birthday). The garden was full of lanterns and surrounded by incense and flowers, which was extremely solemn. Hundreds of Buddhists, including Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, Guan Zhi, Zhao Puchu, Hui Luopuli, and Anthony, participated in the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Central Police Station Detectives Cracked Armed Gang, These Bandits Have Committed Many Crimes, Strict Investigation and Arrest of Accomplices</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that in order to crack down on another armed gang active in the Concession, detectives from the Central Police Station of the Public Concession suddenly went to a certain hotel on Saturday night and successively arrested eight male bandits and three female bandits. It is heard that they have all committed crimes, and there will be fugitives arrested in the next few days. The detectives believe that the gang is very large.</p>
<p>The detectives did not seize any guns when they arrested the bandits, but they believe that the weapons they used will be found in the next few days. It is not yet certain how many crimes the bandits have committed, but it has been proven that they have been active in the Central District, the Old Zhabei District, and the Chengdu Road District. It is also possible that they have committed crimes in other areas of the Public Concession and in the French Concession. The detectives from the Central Police Station first went to a certain hotel on Hankou Road on Saturday night, taking</p>
<p>swift action to arrest five bandits in a certain room, who were taken back to the police station to interrogate their activities and the whereabouts of their accomplices. After a while, the detectives went to the hotel again and arrested three women, who were heard to be related to the theft case. Soon after, with the cooperation of detectives from the French Concession, they went to a certain hotel on Lafayette Road and only arrested one bandit. According to his confession, they obtained the assistance of the Japanese authorities and went to a certain house in Laoximen, the Southern City, and arrested two bandits. No guns were found. The police believe that there are still many members of the gang at large, and many robbery cases can be solved when they are arrested.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Swindlers to Scare Pig Merchants, Three Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>Huang Qixun, who runs a pig business at No. 127, Alley 573, East Xihua Road, and is also a livestock market broker, received a threatening letter on the 27th of last month from the Special Operations 2nd Detachment of the Loyalty and National Salvation Army, requesting Huang to donate 2,000 yuan for military expenses and instructing him to send it to a certain place. Huang reported it to the police station, who ordered detectives to go and wait. However, the bandits did not send any representatives, so they could not be arrested. Until the day before, Xue Youwen, a Chinese detective of the Old Zhabei Police Station, and Detective Ding Yizhong received a report from an informant that bandits were hiding in Room 34 of the Zhongshan Hotel at No. 480 Tianjin Road. They went to arrest them and arrested Shen Aimin from Ningbo, Zheng Qingben from Ningbo, and Huang Jiufeng from Anhui on the spot. It was found that Shen and others were the ones who sent the threatening letter to Huang Qixun, and they also found a second threatening letter to Huang that had been written but not sent. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court 1. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested a postponement. After questioning by Judge Chuan Lin, he ordered them to be detained for a later hearing.</p>
<h3>Monk Sells Opium, Trafficker Convicted</h3>
<p>Yun Zhao, the presiding monk of Baobentang Chan Temple at No. 1622 Changsha Road, instructed Lu Jinbao, a local resident living next door, at 6:30 p.m. on April 27 to take 40 grams and 11 small packets of opium, hidden in a Cocoa cigarette box, and send them to Yinghua Lane on Xiaoshadu Road, to be handed over to a certain person. When passing near Kangnaot Road and McGonigle Road, he was arrested by Chinese police officer No. 3252, who found the opium. After questioning, he learned the truth. He then went to Baobentang to arrest the monk, but he could not be found. Three opium pipes and seven small packets of heroin were found in his room. They were taken to the Gordon Road Police Station and sent to the First District Court. After the interrogation was completed, they were waiting for the sentence to be pronounced. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the trial and sentenced Lu Jinbao to four years of imprisonment and confiscation of the evidence.</p>
<h3>Wing On Company Installs New Fluorescent Lamps</h3>
<p>Wing On Company in Shanghai recently installed a new type of fluorescent lamp, which is a long, round tube that emits bright light, which is no different from sunlight. It can distinguish colors clearly, which is much better than the old-fashioned electric lights. It is heard that this lamp is the latest invention in the United States and is called Fluorescent. It can reduce heat in summer and save electricity, which is most suitable for the current needs of Shanghai. Wing On Company is the first to use it in China and is gradually installing it on each floor. In recent days, there have been many visitors who have come to visit, and they all think that the company is at the forefront of the trend and can keep pace with the times, which is commendable.</p>
<h3>Shanghai in the Eyes of Foreigners</h3>
<p>— (Tao)</p>
<p>Many of your fellow countrymen are really too "naive." Once I saw a large group of people gathered together. I asked what was going on. It was said that they were arresting robbers. I didn't believe they were all detectives arresting robbers. Most of them were very curious, so they took a closer look, but they complained that both the detectives and the robbers were armed. What was their position? This is like children playing with fire, too "naive"!</p>
<p>When Germany invaded, refugees from the Netherlands, Belgium, and France fled, hindering military transportation on the roads. Here, in many public places, it is often like a flood of people escaping, scrambling to be the first. In fact, if everyone can politely maintain order, work can proceed as usual. A lot of effort can be saved by not squeezing, and many trivial quarrels can be avoided. Do you agree?</p>
<p>Probably because Shanghai is a commercial port, there are many people doing business. Many doctors, lawyers, professors, bankers, and reporters also speculate and sell goods. It seems that they can't make a living without doing this business, but the poor people here are suffering a great loss from them!</p>
<p>You want me to tell you about the current cost of living in Shanghai. I'll simply tell you: "I once asked a rickshaw driver. He said that he had to eat fifteen sesame cakes for each meal, each costing five cents, which is seventy-five cents. He eats three meals a day, just sesame cakes made of flour, which costs two yuan and twenty-five cents a day. So he must have an income of more than four yuan a day to maintain his livelihood." This is the standard of living for low-level Chinese. You can imagine the standard of living for middle and high-level Chinese!</p>
<p>Shanghai is a big city, and of course, you can't finish writing about its affairs in a lifetime, especially since I am a foreigner who has just arrived in Shanghai! And I am talking about this topic in front of you, an "old Shanghai," so I dare not write too much. I hope to have the opportunity to take a closer look and experience it more carefully in the future, and write you a few more long letters to talk about it.</p>
<p>I often go to the home of Miss P, who came on the same ship, to play. Shanghai's entertainment is really not to my taste. I live in the French Concession in West Shanghai, which is still clean. There are many farmers who grow vegetables next door, living in short, dark houses, but they are full of energy. In the evening, I often see them talking and laughing in the small courtyard, seemingly very happy. When I see them, I seem to be happier than seeing the wealthy people who are good at hypocrisy.</p>
<p>I've said too much. You said you want to return to your hometown. Come and see this prosperous "Isolated Island of Shanghai"! I wish you a pleasant trip! Goodbye! (Shen)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warehouse at Wayside Wharf Set on Fire, Suspected Sabotage, Several Suspects Arrested</h3>
<p>At about 8 a.m. on the day before yesterday (the 4th), a fire broke out in the cotton pile warehouse of the Japanese East Asia Shipping at Wayside Wharf in East Shanghai. For a time, the flames soared and thick smoke overflowed the room. Cao Asi, the Chinese watchman of the warehouse, discovered it and immediately reported it to the Japanese, who sent someone to put out the fire, which did not become a major disaster. Afterwards, the Japanese found many suspicious items in the burned area in the cotton pile. They determined that someone intended to commit arson, so the military and police conducted a strict investigation. It is also heard that several suspects were arrested by the Japanese and are currently being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Dyeing Price Temporarily Increased by 50%</h3>
<p>There are more than 60 silk and satin dyeing factories in Shanghai. After receiving the request from the dyeing workers to double their drinking expenses, the employers have considered the lives of the workers and are willing to increase them appropriately. It is expected that it will be resolved soon. Now, due to the skyrocketing prices of raw materials and fuels, the factories have been forced to temporarily increase the dyeing price by 50% from today until the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Optimistic Magazine to be Published Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>After Suspension of Unified Enrollment, Measures for Admission to University Preparatory Classes Without Examination</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) This year, the unified enrollment will be suspended for one year. Regarding students in university preparatory classes who have completed their studies and are to be admitted to universities without examination, they will still be assigned by the Ministry of Education. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has formulated "Measures for Recommending and Admitting Students to Universities Without Examination from University Preparatory Classes in the 30th Year of the Republic," instructing all university preparatory classes to comply. The details of these measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Measures for Recommending and Admitting Students to Universities Without Examination from University Preparatory Classes in the 30th Year of the Republic</p>
<p>(1) Students recommended for admission to universities without examination from university preparatory classes shall be limited to the top 50% of those who have completed their studies in the summer of the 30th year, are of good character, physically strong, and have the best academic performance. The number of students recommended from the university preparatory classes approved by the Ministry this spring shall be limited to 25%. Preparatory classes run by individual schools themselves shall not be allowed to recommend students based on this precedent.</p>
<p>(2) University preparatory classes recommending students for admission to universities without examination shall compile a roster, together with application forms, transcripts, and high school diplomas (those who have already submitted them to the Ministry for verification are exempt), and submit them to the Ministry of Education by the end of July at the latest by the fastest means possible. The Minister will then hand them over to the Unified Enrollment Committee of Public Colleges and Universities for review and allocation to various colleges and universities without examination. Rosters, application forms, and transcripts that are not sent out after the deadline will not be allocated.</p>
<p>(3) The application form must be completed by the student, and the transcript must be completed by the school. A 2.5-inch half-length photograph of the student must be attached, and both must be stamped with the school's seal and signed and sealed by the supervisor. Two copies of each should be submitted.</p>
<p>(4) Students admitted to universities without examination who still wish to participate in the entrance examinations of various universities may apply to the respective schools directly, but this must be indicated on the application form. Their qualification for admission without examination will not be canceled. After the allocation, they may choose one school to enter.</p>
<p>(5) If students admitted to universities without examination cannot be allocated to public colleges and universities, they may be allocated to public vocational schools.</p>
<p>(6) The Ministry of Education will announce the allocation of students admitted to universities without examination and will also instruct the original recommending schools to notify each student.</p>
<h3>Xin Huan No. 2 Elementary School Expected to Resume Teaching Today: School Authorities Accept Three Conditions, Final Decision on the Focus</h3>
<p>The staff of the private Xin Huan No. 2 Elementary School on Weihaiwei Road and Chongqing Road in this city went on strike on the morning of the 2nd to demand that the school improve their treatment. This has been reported in various newspapers. According to the most reliable sources from the Da Hua and Guang Hua news agencies, this strike has taken a sharp turn after the relevant parties sent personnel to mediate yesterday. It is expected to resume teaching today. It is understood that the conditions accepted by the school are as follows: 1. A living allowance of 20 yuan per person for May and June. 2. Salaries are calculated on the basis of six months per semester. 3. A living allowance of 10 yuan for July of this semester. According to the above third item, the original focus of the stalemate between the two sides was that the teachers and staff insisted on a living allowance of 20 yuan for July as well, while the school refused due to financial inability to bear it. Subsequently, the educational administration made a final decision late at night, adopting a compromise approach and issuing a living allowance of 10 yuan in July. After the school accepted it, the teachers and staff who remained at the school also considered the overall situation and were willing to accept it. Therefore, the school issued a notice late yesterday, scheduling the resumption of classes today. It is expected that this strike will be resolved in this way, unless there are special circumstances.</p>

Teachers in each school will receive subsidies based on the amount of work they do.

<h3>Xiqing Volleyball Women's Group, Shanghai Star vs. A di xue Tonight, Group A Xiqing vs. Yinghua Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The 13th Xiqing Volleyball Tournament, which opened at the beginning of last month, has lasted for more than a month. Only the last match of Group A, Xiqing vs. Yinghua, remains, which will be held at 8:00 PM tomorrow afternoon. The first cycle of the women's group order can also be completed this week. The four winning teams will start another single-elimination system next Tuesday (the 13th) to determine the champions and runners-up.

The former has many famous players and is full of strength, while the latter has lost all four matches and is technically mediocre. Therefore, when the two teams meet, it is like hitting a stone with an egg. Shanghai Star is very confident of victory. The other two matches are both in Group B. Also, in the previous competition, the B team Bai lost to Ya Mi Ning, which was actually a mistake in which the Bai team won against Ya Mi Ning, and should be corrected urgently.</p>

<h3>How to Choose Books (II)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Liangsheng</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Interests and Cultivation</p>
<p>A person's interests are subject to change. Someone who likes literature at one time may soon like science. In terms of cultivation, the situation changes even more. For example, as Xia Gaizun said, "In addition to his duties as a doctor, this doctor certainly has interests or a life of cultivation. In terms of interests, if he plays Go, he may want to read books about Go. If he likes literature and art, he may want to read poetry and novels. In terms of cultivation, if he aspires to cultivate his character, he will naturally read biographies of famous people or classic maxims. If he feels that his body must be exercised, he will naturally read books about swimming and sports. This is reading in terms of interests or cultivation."</p>
<p>If we are middle school students studying at school, then our duty is to study various subjects. The books we should read in our duties are the textbooks prescribed by the school for each subject. Reading textbooks is not an easy or simple task. We should read each textbook carefully.</p>
<p>Speaking of reference books, their need is temporary and does not need to be decided in advance. However, before we refer to them, we should ask ourselves what we must refer to. For example, as Xia Gaizun said, "Taking the Chinese language subject as an example, if we read a Peach Blossom Spring in the Chinese language textbook and there are unfamiliar words, we have to look up the dictionary. At this time, the dictionary (assuming it is the Ci Yuan) becomes a reference book. This article (Peach Blossom Spring) was written by someone from the Jin Dynasty. If we feel that the sentiments are somewhat different from the articles written by people from other times and want to know the situation of Jin Dynasty literature, we will look up the History of Chinese Literature (assuming it is Feng Wuliang's History of Chinese Literature). At this time, the History of Chinese Literature becomes a reference book. This article writes about a utopian idea. Because of the teachings of teachers and friends, we know that an English social thinker named Marles wrote a book called News from Nowhere, which is similar in nature to what Tao Qian wrote. If we take it out for comparison, then News from Nowhere becomes a reference book. This article belongs to the category of narration. If we want to understand the format of narrative writing, we can look up Narrative Writing Techniques (assuming it is compiled by Sun Liangong). At this time, Narrative Writing Techniques becomes a reference book. Also, the author of this article is called Tao Qian. If we want to know his character, we can look up the Biography of Tao Qian in the Book of Jin or the Collection of Tao. At this time, the Book of Jin or the Collection of Tao becomes a reference book."</p>
<p>2.  Standards for Choosing Books</p>
<p>The scope of books is very broad. Choosing them carefully is originally a very difficult task. Having the principles of selection, it is also necessary to have an appropriate standard. If there is no appropriate standard, sometimes I am afraid that it will inevitably be a waste of energy and time. According to Yu Tianxiu's opinion, the standards for choosing books are (1) do not be confused by propaganda, (2) do not be tempted by advertisements, (3) do not read books that are not beneficial, (4) do not read books that are not famous, (5) do not read books that still do not have a reputation after one year of publication, (6) do not read books that do not have a considerable introduction, (7) do not read ordinary books (this refers to beginners), (8) do not read books that are not similar to their own nature, (9) do not read non-excellent books, (10) do not read books that do not have value, (11) do not read books that do not contain good moral lessons, (12) do not read books that are not easy to understand, (13) do not read books that are not related to one's own life, (14) do not read books that lead people to evil, (15) do not read books whose benefits are not enough to compensate for the loss of time, (16) do not read books that cannot be applied, and (17) do not read books that are not equal to their own level. According to Zhu Qian's opinion, the standards for choosing books are: first, read modern books, do not read outdated books; second, read progressive books, do not read backward books; third, read general books, do not read too specialized books. The opinions of the above families are nothing more than generally similar. I think that since the scope of books is very broad, it is indeed not easy to list standards. For the sake of simplicity, it may be possible to divide the book area into four departments: (1) cultivating character, (2) increasing knowledge and skills, (3) cultivating sentiments and interests, and (4) training thinking.</p>

<h3>New Words from a Parrot</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>The famous British biologist Julian Huxley was strolling around his house one day when he suddenly heard an air raid siren. Professor Huxley instinctively rushed to a safe place and looked up to the sky to see which direction the German planes were attacking from. As a result, he could not see the shadow of the plane or hear the sound of the plane dropping bombs. Huxley felt strange, so he used the spirit of a scientist to study this mysterious event. The result was that the air raid siren turned out to be emitted by a parrot in the house. Because it was so similar, the owner mistakenly thought it was a real air raid siren.</p>
<p>In recent months, it is said that British parrots in the war have also learned the sound of bombs falling very realistically, sometimes making the people in the house uneasy. Parrots were originally playthings of the idle class, but now they have become a nuisance. The war has affected every corner of the world and has increased the smart parrot's new vocabulary. But this may not be a good result for the future destiny of the parrot.</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Heart Change</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Has my heart changed? Why is it so numb now?</p>
<p>Who injected a mesmerizing venom into my heart, paralyzing its compassionate consciousness? Who sowed the evil seeds of thorns in my heart, obscuring the roots of its sympathy?</p>
<p>Isn't my heart, which is the most easily moved, did once shed tears when I saw the ring of haggard people who were shivering and standing upright in the harsh north wind in front of the rice sale? Wasn't it once, when I saw the bored and lined up powder-coated meat screens under the drizzling rain opposite the Great World, that I felt sorrowful and wanted to cry? I also couldn't eat when I read the report that tens of millions of disaster victims in Hebei Province were digging up grass roots and bark to barely survive! I was also depressed all day because I saw the records that some famine victims in Sichuan Province were actually stealing and eating corpses! As for every time I think of the refugees in my country or Europe who are struggling under airplanes and cannons, that vivid picture of broken arms and legs, supporting the old and carrying the young, it makes me feel extremely sad.</p>
<p>But how long has it been? This heart of mine, which is still the same, has become indifferent to all of this, and is indifferent to it! Is it because it is commonplace, and my sensibility has been dulled by the "law of habit"? Is it because of disappointment and pessimism that I have adopted the view that "I am not concerned with what happens after I am gone"? ... No, no, not at all! It is because I deeply understand that crying and sorrow are of no benefit to the facts.</p>
<p>To be honest, what is the use of crying? Crying is just giving the "tear glands" a little work to do! - Even if you shed all your tears and then shed blood, will the pain of others be lessened because of this? What good is grief? Grief is just a few bubbles that appear and disappear in the rolling, countless waves of the "stream of consciousness," without leaving a trace! - Even if some traces are left, will the social environment be improved because of this?</p>
<p>Therefore, I will not only not cry or be sad in the future; I will cherish my tears and cherish my consciousness, because I want to demand a significant, or at least commensurate, price for them! That is to say, I want to transform this useless power hidden inside into a fighting power that can be expressed outside! I want to work hard to do some things that can benefit human society!</p>
<p>I know very well that I am just such a small ant in this great anthill of mankind; but I want to be a diligent worker ant! Even if it only carries a grain of food every day, it is considered to have exhausted its meager strength. I can see even more clearly that I am just such a humble bee in this great beehive of society; but I want to be a hardworking worker bee! Even if he only collects a little pollen every month, he has always done his best.</p>
<p>I also want to emulate the perseverance of the ox and the spirit of the horse. I want to move forward step by step, until I evaporate the last drop of sweat, pour out the last drop of blood, and swallow the last breath!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(7) Draw a Cross on Your Face</p>
<p>"Slow down, Master!" He immediately moved to Lao Yuan's side and said with a smile, "This is a concession, and it's not easy to clean up if something goes wrong; I have a plan that is even more satisfying than shooting him!"</p>
<p>Today, Ji Zhaoxiong really deserves to be a favorite of Yuan Baofan.</p>
<p>"Tell me! Tell me!"</p>
<p>"Let's not kill him, just use a knife to draw a cross on his face, so that he will never be able to see people from now on, that will be enough for him for the rest of his life!" This idea of Ji Zhaoxiong's was not just thought of at this moment. Before he informed Yuan Baofan, his other plan was to get a bottle of strong water to destroy Begonia's face, slightly venting his anger. Now that things have completely broken down, he feels that he can just change to using a knife quickly.</p>
<p>Yuan Baofan turned his head and glanced at Begonia's face, which although had turned gray, was still very delicate and handsome, and immediately nodded.</p>
<p>When Ji Zhaoxiong moved his feet, intending to rush out to get the knife, Begonia almost fainted again. Because he loves beauty by nature, if a heat sore accidentally grows on his face, or if he gets hurt somewhere, he feels like a stone is pressing on his heart, and he often keeps looking in the mirror, wishing he could change several kinds of medicine a day, until the sore heals, the blood scabs off, and there are indeed no traces left on his face, then he can sleep peacefully. Now Ji Zhaoxiong is so ruthless that he doesn't want Yuan Zhenshoushi to kill him simply, but wants to use a knife to draw a cross on his face. (98)</p>

<h3>Night Glasses</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>In order to train the army to fight at night, the British have invented a kind of "night glasses". When soldiers wear this kind of glasses, they immediately look around, as if the black night has come to the earth. Wearing this kind of glasses for target practice can make soldiers familiar with the situation of night combat. The scenery at night is different from that in the daytime, and the sight of the rifle cannot be used. If you want to fight in this situation, you must have special training.</p>
<p>Household</p>
<h3>Our Home</h3>
<p>— Hui Luo</p>
<p>I envy the sweet homes of others.</p>
<p>My father's slamming of tables, throwing furniture, tearing clothes, and my mother's loud crying, shouting, and jumping around are our daily homework. Whenever these times come, my younger siblings and I have no choice but to run out in a puff of smoke, and "hide" in the alley outside the back door for a while. Otherwise, no one can avoid the violent beatings from my father's rage. However, this is just like having malaria. When it breaks out, it is a mix of cold and heat, fierce and overwhelming. Once the time passes, it is like a sunny day after the rain. It often breaks out in the afternoon, and by dinner, they are already arm in arm, getting into the car to go to a night banquet.</p>
<p>My father is a doctor. He probably entered society very early, from a doctor's assistant to starting his own hospital. In the meantime, he went through quite a bit of struggle. However, when I was very young, I became familiar with my father's stories of stealing medicine during his assistant days, and the fraudulent tricks of injecting distilled water instead of vitamin preparations for patients, from the mouths of workers and nurses. Whenever my father proudly narrated his entrepreneurial journey, I would often have an extremely contemptuous aversion.</p>
<p>My mother studied nursing, but did not learn it well. Although she now has a doctor's license, few people seek her medical advice. However, she is very proud. I often hear her reprimanding nurses sternly, and she always mixes in the following words: "I am the hospital director's wife, I am a doctor, and I am also the head nurse. Who dares not listen to me?..." Although these can only damage her dignity, she never realizes it. Only after being beaten severely by my father does she become as weak as a lamb. Because of this, my grandparents dare not live with us.</p>
<p>Most of the arguments between my father and mother are about another woman. From the newly admitted students each year, my father is accustomed to seducing a female student to satisfy his desires. Once discovered by my mother, disputes arise. Then there is slamming of tables, tearing of clothes, throwing of furniture... After a considerable period of time, the strange thing is that my mother will actually help my father cleverly devise ways to evade the legal responsibilities he should bear, and drive the other woman away. How many innocent girls are trapped in the abyss of lifelong mental anguish, and we are also constantly worried about the disasters that these inevitable disputes bring us.</p>
<p>Now, my father has again selected one from the most recently admitted group of female students to live with him outside. I am very familiar with her. She is only one or two years older than me. My father seems particularly infatuated with her. Except for coming home for two hours of consultation during the day, he is rarely at home, leaving all the diagnostic work to two assistant doctors. My mother naturally often protests, and the result is still nothing more than slamming tables, tearing clothes, throwing furniture, and being beaten. But we can still hear her often triumphantly shouting: "I am the hospital director's wife, I am a doctor, I am the head nurse..."</p>
<p>When will I be able to leave my home?</p>

<h3>Introducing New Actors at the Carlton</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>After Zhou Xinfang posted his resignation, the authorities invited the father and son of Yan Jupeng from Peking Opera to Shanghai to take over Zhou Xinfang's spot. All the actors and musicians, except Wang Xichun, remained the same. In addition to Yan Jupeng and Xiao Peng, Yan Jupeng brought with him the violinist Gao Zhengqing, drummer Wei Xiyun, supporting actor Ma Liankun, Wang Fushan, Lu Xicai, and Lu Hongrui. The Carlton also specially invited female actress Zhang Yiyun to perform opposite Yan Jupeng. I will briefly describe each person's art to inform fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng came from the amateur world. He has been immersed in Tan-style opera for decades. No one in the opera world is second to him in his study of pronunciation and purity of melody. Since Yu Shuyan imitated Tan-style opera and called himself the Yu school, Jupeng followed him and also established the Yan school. From then on, he incorporated his own ideas into Tan-style opera. In the past ten years, due to many family misfortunes and unfilial children, his voice has changed and his energy has weakened, and he is no longer as good as he used to be. Therefore, he has devoted himself to articulation and intonation. In recent years, his singing and modulation are flawless, which can be a model for future generations. However, because the words are too orthodox, the melody is therefore not round, and gradually becomes strange. Moreover, he imitates Tan's use of the Hunan and Hubei dialect too much, so that sometimes it does not resemble Peking Opera at all, and completely becomes Han opera. In recent years, seeing the decline of the opera world, he does not hesitate to risk his old life to struggle, and his spirit and perseverance are admirable.</p>
<p>Yan Xiaopeng is the younger brother of Shaopeng. He sings male warrior roles. He once belonged to Ding Yongli's school. His appearance and aura are excellent, but his foundation is slightly inferior, so he does not have many plays he can perform. He is a promising talent.</p>
<p>Zhang Yiyun is the younger sister of Zhang Eyun. When Eyun was performing in Beijing and Tianjin, Yiyun was only seven or eight years old. In the past five or six years, she has been influenced by her sister and taught by Furongcao Hu Tiefen, and her artistic skills have been able to glimpse the essence of Eyun's art. It is said that Zhang Shu's performance at the Carlton this time was introduced by a certain celebrity. The violinist Hu Tiefen and the drummer Wei Xiyun are both followers of Eyun.</p>
<p>Ma Liankun is Yan Jupeng's old partner. He plays both the copper hammer and the armored warrior roles. He is calm and experienced, and is invaluable. When he performs with Yan, he does his best to support him. His art is not weak, but he is limited by his talent and has not enjoyed great fame.</p>
<p>Wang Chenshan is the son of Wang Changlin. He follows his father's art and respects Yu Shuyan, so he is very good at accompanying Tan-style operas. In Beijing, in addition to working in the opera troupe, old Tan-style opera amateurs like to have him as their partner.</p>
<p>Lu Xicai is one of the six major disciples of the founding of the Fuliancheng Opera School. He specializes in the martial clown role. His martial arts skills are very good, and his belly is particularly broad. He once played Zhu Guangzu in "The Chain Trap," Hu Che'er in "Battle of Wancheng," Wang Dong in "Evil Tiger Village," the doomed general in "Changban Slope," Qin Ren in "Taking Gao Deng," and the groom in "Lianying Village." In addition to performing with Xiao Peng, he also directs Xiao Peng. Wu Jing Lu Hongrui, this is his first time coming to the South. His skills are mediocre, not as aggressive as Zhang Lianting or as fierce as Gao Shenghong.</p>
<p>The violinist is Gao Zhengqing, the cousin of Gao Shenglin. I dare not comment on his skill and technique because I have not heard him play. Drummer Wei San is one of the three famous drummers in the North. The three famous ones are Hang Zihe, Qiao Yuquan, and Wei Xiyun. Hang specializes in playing Yu-style male beard roles, so Wang Shaolou, Fei Xiaolin, Yang Baosen, and others treat him as their right-hand man. Qiao has been with Ma Lianliang for a long time, and his understanding is broader than Hang. In plays such as "Sweet Dew Temple," "A Pinch of Snow," and "Borrowing the East Wind," his wrist is flexible and his beats are clean. No drummer today can match him. Wei specializes in accompanying female actresses. All of Wang Yaoqing's disciples use Wei as their drummer, such as Wang Youqing, Hua Huilin, and Wang Yurong. In addition to being good at playing female roles, Wei is also able to play male roles, so Yan Jupeng also hired him as his drummer.</p>
<h3>A Note on Female Actress Li Guifen</h3>
<p>— Yin'er</p>
<p>Ms. Li Guifen, who is performing on stage at the Golden Theater today, is a famous female actress from the old capital. She enjoyed fame early on, surpassing Meng Xiaodong, and was extremely popular for a time. Her gestures and bright voice were unparalleled. Therefore, at that time, her reputation was widely praised and she was famous throughout the old capital. After marrying, she stopped performing for many years. Who knew that good times would not last long, and her husband also died. Ms. Li went into seclusion in Shanghai, and had no interest in returning to the stage, nor did she interact with the outside world. Such an artist has been buried and unheard of, which is regrettable! The fans in Shanghai eagerly wanted to see her art again, so they initiated a grand gathering. Ai Shiju, Liu Binkun, Furongcao and others were her supporting cast. In addition, they invited the famous female amateur Gu Wenjuan to join in singing a section of "Female Escort." It is expected that tonight there will be heavy traffic and an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>
<h3>News from the Opera World in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>— Yanzhao Landlord</p>
<p>Tan Fuying has returned to Beijing from Tianjin and is scheduled to perform at the Guangde Theater on May 7th. Hou Yulan is still invited to play the female lead.</p>
<p>Ma Youkun, the son of Ma Liankun, the supporting actor who came to Shanghai with Yan San, plays Tan-style old man roles. He has performed "Loss of Jieting, Empty City Stratagem, and Beheading Ma Su" at the Guanghe Theater.</p>
<p>Mao Shilai has compiled the plays of Fan Lihua into one book, renamed "Sisters-in-Law Heroes," and will play Fan Lihua himself. He will perform in the near future.</p>
<p>Since Yan Huizhu became a disciple of Zhu Guifang, she has specialized in Mei-style operas, and even the supporting actors are from the Mei Opera Troupe, such as Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua, Liu Lianrong, and Wang Shaoting.</p>
<p>Ren Zhiqi, a rising star female actress, is a disciple of Yu Lianxian and is very popular in Beijing.</p>
<p>Xiao Cheng Yanqiu Liu Yingqiu, Yu Shuang's proud disciple, has accepted an invitation from a friend to form a troupe and perform at the Guangde Theater.

<h3>Li Ming's Way Out</h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>It is rumored that actor Li Ming of the National Drama Association has been hired by the Green Treasure Theater and will specialize in stage plays. However, this matter has not yet been decided. Although Green Treasure has invited him, Li Ming has been highly valued by the authorities since he performed "Loyalty and Righteousness for a Thousand Years" at the National Drama Association. Even if Green Treasure can give him a higher salary, it is naturally worth considering whether it is a good way out. I remember that Green Treasure once invited Xia Xia and was willing to give her a monthly salary of seven hundred yuan, but Xia Xia politely declined. She believes that the purpose of acting is at least not for money, but mostly for interest. Her willingness to work hard in drama is for interest.</p>
<p>Brief News (1) More than 50 painters and calligraphers in this city, including Shen Qiquan, Zhang Yanchang, Wang Lianyou, and Xiong Song, have jointly initiated the revival of the Hai Shang Ti Jin Painting and Calligraphy Society.

<h3>Jade Flowers in a Bloody Rain</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Falling Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water</p>
<p>Wang Yongtai then allowed Xu Jing to stay at his home. He also told him that because he had been widowed for many years, running around the world, alone, he had initially fallen ill here and lacked someone to serve him. Therefore, General Zhou Yuji had repeatedly advised him to take a concubine who could accompany him day and night. Then a fellow soldier introduced him to a woman surnamed He in this city, and he took her as his concubine and settled down here. Now that he had a family, how could he not laugh? Wang Yongtai said and laughed several times. Xu Jing said, "Uncle is old and should have someone to serve him. If he can give birth to a son in the future, continuing his lineage, it would be even more gratifying." Wang Yongtai laughed again and said, "This old man is used to being scattered and does not hope for children and grandchildren around his knees to comfort his twilight years. Fortunately, my younger brother is in Jiangling and has many sons, enough to succeed me. I am not afraid of becoming an unavenged ghost of the Ruo Ao clan. You are the son of my close friend, and like family, let me introduce you so you can get to know each other." Xu Jing said, "It is appropriate for your nephew to pay his respects." Wang Yongtai then excitedly led Xu Jing to the back hall and ordered the maid to quickly invite Lady He to come out. After a while, the sound of pendants was heard, and several maids escorted a young woman out to meet them: her hair was like clouds and black as ink, so shiny it could be used as a mirror, apricot face and peach cheeks, willow eyebrows and phoenix eyes, she was extremely beautiful, her figure was also very graceful, her age was no more than twenty or so, and she was dressed in beautiful clothes and accessories, extremely gorgeous. Xu Jing quickly paid his respects. Lady He also returned the greeting. Wang Yongtai pointed to Xu Jing and said to Lady He, "This is Xu Jing, the son of an old friend. He has come here to join the army and is staying at my house. You should treat him well." Lady He responded in a charming voice. After sitting and talking for a few words, Xu Jing asked to be excused and left, and was led by a servant to sit in the guest room. Before long, a maid brought out quilts and pillows to tidy up the bed for Xu Jing and make the bedding, and then left. That night, Xu Jing stayed at Wang Yongtai's house. After breakfast the next day, Wang Yongtai led Xu Jing to the general's office to see Zhou Yuji. Xu Jing saw that Zhou Yuji had a fair face, ape arms, and a wasp waist, and was born with an awe-inspiring demeanor, worthy of being a good defender of the country. He hurriedly bowed down. Zhou Yuji personally helped him up and invited him to sit on the side. Wang Yongtai first explained Xu Jing's background and origin to Zhou Yuji, and then talked about his desire to join the army, asking Zhou Yuji to employ him. Zhou Yuji saw that Xu Jing's character was outstanding and nodded in approval, and said, "Now is the time when the country needs people, and ambitious people will not be willing to hide their talents and be buried in the grass. Swing my horizontal spear and sweep away those bandits. It is good that you have come, I need good talents here, so I will have to trouble you to temporarily stay under my command as a Yunqi Wei. If you have merit in the future, you can be promoted." Xu Jing said, "Thank you for your cultivation, I am willing to serve you." So he excused himself and left. From then on, Xu Jing served under Zhou Yuji's command. (55)</p>
