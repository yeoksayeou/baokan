<p>社評</p>
<h3>演成世界大戰的新機運</h3>
<p>巴爾幹半島北接歐大陸，南面伸入地中海中央。小國林立，各族叢處，而資源豐饒，在歐洲自成一個區域。軸心方面視此為無須流血而必得控制的對象，自始沒有選此為戰塲、尤切望戰事不致波及於此。縱使義大利冒昧進襲希臘，鑄成大錯，但納粹並未變更其以和平政治手腕經營巴爾幹的初衷。及至南斯拉夫將膏饞吻前的一霎那，忽起鉅變，局勢頓然改觀，又經過了爾後旬日間的發展，證明了納粹再沒有巧取的餘地，於是當前唯一岐途：不是自認失敗，自甘歛手，便是另行籌運，從事作戰。觀察一般情勢，戰事延擴至於巴爾幹，殆無可避免，而其爆發且期不在遠了。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫政變而後，對德態度迄無明顯表示，因而引起若干人士的懷疑；其實假如南國當局仍將履行其依附軸心協的的義務，則政變一舉豈非多餘？祗因政局甫經更張，一切均待佈置、內部的少數民族問題亦未安排妥貼，乃致不得不暫以模稜態度拖延德方攻勢。近一二日，克羅地族已決定合作，其領袖已參加新政府；英美希十諸國，又紛紛加以鼓勵或保障；即在蘇聯，既申賀南王即位於前，更與之締結不侵協定於後，允為堅定南國抗禦外侮的勇氣之重要因素。而其軍事上的總動員，採取準備狀態，這是南國對德態度明期化的前奏；如果不是德方於此尙有所踟蹰或期待，則雙方必已兵戎相見了。</p>
<p>專就德南間軍事情勢來看，南國顯居劣勢；自從匈羅保三國相繼附德之後，南國的邊界，除却西面臨海及與希臘接壤的二百公里而外，幾乎三面都受納粹及其與國的包圍；其本國地勢雖多山岳險阻，却又偏在東南一隅；而與奧匈羅馬尼亞接壤地帶，則都是平坦而利於機械化部隊的原野。加以南國京城，距離匈牙利境不過七十餘公里之遙，整個多瑙河流域都是極便於德軍的侵人；假如德軍取道匈境進犯，南國防禦當至感艱難。這也許就是日前德力所以加緊壓迫匈牙利，以致匈國首相戴萊基竟出於自殺的原因。但是南國軍民敵愾奮發，剽悍善戰，如能與希軍及登陸英軍作良好配合，儘先把義大利的殘餘軍力驅出阿爾巴尼亞，然後憑藉險阻二强毅抵抗，有如前决大戰之抗禦奧軍，則德軍縱使進犯，亦難發揮閃電作戰與速戰速決的效果，而將演成長期苦戰。這在德國方面不只冒着兩面作戰危險，且擾及其後方的倉庫，無論勝負何若，均屬害多利少。</p>
<p>德國的對英戰略，一方是攻取英倫一島，一方是切斷和擾亂央國的海外交通和物資接濟，前此希特勒之竭力避免把巴爾幹戰事擴大，用意即在集中全力以便攻英。到現在，德國既已被迫而用兵於巴爾幹，其進攻英倫又無取勝把握，今後殆將變更軍略，重彈進侵近束的舊調。目前利比亞德義聯軍的東進，與夫巴爾幹德軍的南進。這種遙相呼應的局勢，儼然又是去歲一度喧傳對近東英領螯形攻勢之具體而微的表現。到了德南戰事爆然之後，德軍必不致僅把軍事行動囿於南國一隅，一定更要直趨薩羅尼加，以謀進迫希臘，相機前進。到那時候，土耳其勢難繼續袖手旁觀，自此巴爾幹將成為雙力展開惡戰的戰塲。</p>
<p>如果離開純軍事觀點而從政治方面觀察，則未來發展更孕育着許多値得注意的複雜因素。第一，蘇聯之於歐戰，即便還小能驟即武斷其已有百八十度的轉變，但現在不侵協定締結的對象，則已由軸心國家轉移到反軸心國家，其對於土南兩國的態度已儼然和歐戰燥發之際的對於德國一樣。迨主戰事固已擴延至巴爾幹，且將迫近蘇聯的黑海門戶，則爾後的蘇聯的動態與動向如何，正是個極饒興味的問題。第二，日外相松岡從　國再到柏林的時候，據說曾有日本倘遇他國干預其外交政策，必將與之作戰的的言。此一表示雖較消極，亦自具有相當伸縮性；巴爾幹戰事固非軸心之利，在急功近利的日當局則未必不即視為發動新的冒險之良機。第三，歐洲交戰國雙方的角逐，最近正逐漸向着歐非兩洲以外擴展；美國的沒收德義船隻是幫助民治國家的行動，而美國若干有關軍需的工廠罷工，除却勞資間本身糾紛而外，顯亦有第五縱隊操持其間，藉以延宕援英戰具的生產。在小亞細亞，伊拉克突然政變，新政權雖未必完全親軸心而得予英國以重大牽掣，然德義近年來在阿刺伯各部落中的活動力量，亦自未可輕侮。這類趨勢，必將隨着巴爾幹戰爭爆發而益形開展，這也就是歐戰之將要擴大為世界戰爭的前奏。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（四三）　戰時德國的內幕</h3>
<p>就陸上來講、柏林的高射砲可說裝得最密集了，但是在事實上並無多大裨益。柏林人總覺得奇怪，為什麼在幾百隻的探照燈之下，連空中一個小小零頭數目的飛機都找不到。在六個月這經驗後，他們確認柏林對於衣間空襲的防務，一點也沒有收效。戈林會對他們保障，柏林決不致受到空襲，他們在第一次遭襲之前，一直都很想信此話。等待迷夢醒來，影響著實不小。柏林不像倫敦，沒有空中汽球陣的設備，所以要是天好的話，英國飛機在市內常常飛得很低呢。</p>
<p>話雖如此，柏林人卻並不只限於防空室中討生活。國明黨為支持民氣起見，認為即在戰時，民衆的日常生活中也得摻此輕鬆的成份。還是談戲館罷。其實座之盛，可說超過承平之時的任何紀錄。柏林城內每個戲院都開的票子，在一星期之前早就售馨。如果要在大街的國立歌劇院中獲一座位，那末非得提早兩星期之前去定座不可。在國社黨統制這下的一班劇作家所寫出來的劇本，大多不值一顧。戲院老團們乃不時以哥德，喜勒，摩利埃，卡爾得隆，易卜生，和卻科夫等的古典派戲劇來號召。但是賣座最盛的戲劇著作家卻是英為人—沙士比亞和蕭伯納，當我離開柏林之頃，凡是蕭伯納所作的戲劇，無不一一上演。德軍西慶之日的前一晚，劇作家墨索里尼所寫的「一百天」一劇，在柏林國家大戲院中擾動不巳的觀衆之前搬演。那晚戈林亦在場觀看，幾小時之後，他跳出戲院中的包廂，駛至德空軍總司令部下令空軍總攻。</p>
<p>其時柏林至少有六家音樂喜劇團，營業之發達實為從來所未有。這種歌劇要是和英國優伶所唱的比起來，未免相形見拙，流於沉悶和俗艷的一路，可是柏林人倒頗有嗜痂的胃口。希特勒亦有此同好。他會參觀過好幾次在都城劇院中所扮演的兩場歌劇，而且對於一個匈牙利舞女尤為激賞，會特她邀她茶敘。希特勒生平酷嗜華格納港歌劇，但自戰事發生，軍書旁午，自去歲起一年半以來，久已大欣賞此調了。至於各式大小跳舞，顧客們只要化上少數門票柏林杯啤酒費，就可坐在裏面，從獨幕喜劇主斯洛伐克的大力士表演，縱覽一飽，這種場所的生意因而也利市三倍呢。</p>
<p>戈林特許少數可靠的喜劇家對時事略加諷刺，大半為關時戰時措施方面食物與衣服消費統制的噱頭話，一語旣出，滿堂為之閧然。其實這是當局的一種巧妙言傳，無非是要使老百姓心裏起一種意念，以為希特勒所禁止他們於公共場所批評政府的自由，那一星可實貴的自由之火花，在鐵的紀律的獨裁制度之下，現在竟又復活了。諷刺上可以觸犯當局的地方當然也不一而足。我會聽說柏林最紅的喜劇伶人威萊史卻弗士，因為對「我們所新交而敬重的蘇聯朋友加以譏笑，而在柯福斯丹達他自已舞場中被拘，只有他敢做這種「如覆薄冰」的把戲。關於義大利及戈林所穿制服的笑話槪在禁止之例。</p>
<p>戲院塞滿之後，柏林人便拚命向音樂院衝去。福德望格勒博士所指導的「柏林之樂團」，去冬演奏十次，所有票了在去秋即巳預售一空。現在他每場音樂都要連奏兩次，可是向隅的人還是不少。去年十一月與十二月間，柏林星期報紙上所登的音樂廣告，每一星期演奏次數多至二十五起。其中三分之一的廣告上，還連帶聲明，所有人場劵均已售完。</p>
<p>因為央轟炸機白盡不來，而「夜場」表現又自下午四時半或五時開始，柏林居民僅可欣賞他們的戲劇，歌曲，和嚴正的音樂，而不受空襲的驚擾。這樣，對於民氣的維持，倒是關係綦重。在此種情況之下，一切生活格外見得正常，誠如有幾個德國人對我說，大家對於戰爭的緊張，因此亦為之鬆弛不少哩。</p>
<p>柏林雖然在耶穌聖誕節之前禁止跳舞，各家夜總會裏卻是每晚滿谷。柯福司丹達熟市區中幾家跳舞場，我目覩有好幾百對青年俊侶，其中大半是綫回業度假期的青年軍官，帶著他們的女伴，坐在桌子旁，很不耐煩地跟著爵士音樂調子，手拍足蹈，躍躍欲試。柏林旣禁「黑人的爵士」音樂，又不准奏演輕鬆的俗調，可是德國人的短波廣播電台，常會異軍突起，把這兩種被禁的音樂，從空氣中洩漏出來，給南菲和南美的無綫電聽衆收聽</p>
<p>運運一事，對於日常工作緊張，而致疲乏的德國人，能給以一種慰藉。每當德國球隊與義大利，或附庸德國的匈牙利及羅馬尼亞球隊比賽足球，任何星期日下午，奧令匹克運動場中就要擠上十萬觀衆。著名重拳擊家像華爾脫牛塞爾與人比賽時，柏林體育館中至少也有十萬觀衆，前去助與。最近有人提護邀史乞黑林與人在柏林舉行一次盛大的拳擊賽，可惜他因在軍中練習飛機降落傘失慎受傷，此議就此作罷了</p>
<p>柏林連高爾夫球運動也繼績存在。會有一時公家為節省汽油計，會禁止人民開駛汽車，柏林市民無法往郊外的萬茜球場去，於是高爾夫也就停頓起來。後來德國的運動明星滋卻茂和奧斯頓登高一呼，公家特准供給兩輛汽車的汽油，由萬茜高架車站把球員們載送至三英里外的高爾夫球場去比賽</p>
<p>每屆賽馬之期，萬人空巷，情形一如承平之時，而且我最近還會注意到，各報對於大賽馬的錦標得主紀事也用大標題，和戰事新聞一同刊在報紙對面。</p>
<p>德國民氣至今還很健全，但講句老實話，平民百姓卻巳精疲力竭，渴望和平。叫人感覺得奇怪的，就是德國人對於英國並不怎樣的恨得咬牙切齒。年半以來，我不時往菜館，咖啡館，並常常搭乘火車，地道車，公共汽車，電車用飛機，因操英語而被禁止，前後只有一回。那時巴黎纜告淪陷，我止在巴黎一家菜館中，與幾個德國兵用英語交談，即遭德國秘密警察上前阻止。不問前線實際作戰的德國空軍，對於英國空軍作戰的勇敢和熟練，一致加以欽敬。德國空軍人員尤激賞「噴火」式飛機之佳其於「颶風」及「挑戰」兩式則次之。即以我所熟識的德國人而論，他們多數對於英國空軍戰士駕機長征，來德轟炸之舉，譽為英勇非常。德國人對於同盟國義大利，字裏行間總未免有些潮笑的樣子。這種態度不但德國的人民如此，即促成德義盟約的國社黨領袖們亦復相同。當義大利軍隊與希戰交戰漸形不支之頃，下面一個對白甚為流行。有人問道，「義大利的秘密武器究竟是些什麼東西？」正確的答語說：「就是德國軍隊。」</p>
<p>德國人對於美國人當然沒有什麼惡感，不過大家都覺得美國的助英漸臻具體，甚至也準備牽入漩渦。關於美國的援英，德國報紙上很少紀載，故百姓們亦不知其詳。德國報紙對於羅斯福總統的演說，抨擊不遺餘力，其實讀者對於羅斯福的演說原文從未寓目，不知報紙對於他攻擊些什麼。及到最近兩三個月以來，英國對於戰事的態度，使德國人漸漸地感覺不安起來。美國如果參戰，這於德國的民氣打擊甚大。一般德國人關於此事的思想極為簡單。他們所想的是，「上次歐戰時，美國於我們尚在勝利之時參戰，結果我們敗了。現在美國又要在我們勝利之時參戰，也許我們又要二次戰敗了。」</p>
<p>國社黨領袖們和最高軍事當局，早承認美國巳經參戰，所差的衹一種名義而巳。因之德國方面竭力想在年內，或在六個月中，獲得最後勝利。德方所知的美國情形，較之美國人自已還要清楚，他們從美國所獲得的秘密情報，其正確可靠，令人驚異不止。他們知道美國在軍事上方在開始，軍炎和飛機兩項，一切都未準備。不問希特勒推斷美國參戰時期在春季，夏季或在秋季，他所開場，而先下手為強。</p>

<h3>調整工部局機構　納稅會可望通過　日且認爲僅係臨時辦法　大會議程昨經局方公布</h3>

<p>各方關切　租界前途</p>
<p>目前全市各界、對於太平洋戰爭時、上海之地位頗為注意、誠恐一旦被日所攫、一切失去保障、唯據觀察家謂、如日美戰爭、日本不致奪取租界、其實際原因、爲（一）上海為日本套收外滙之最後地域、（二）上海不僅祇爲英美兩國之利益所在、容易引起廣大之國際糾紛、但無論如何、租界雖不致被奪、日本及他之勢力、勢將在租界內畸形膨脹、工部局之行政機構、或竟難維持費利溥所宣佈之「建議」非英美國籍之納稅人將有決斷租界一切之能力、故設目前當局不防微杜漸、日後之發展、實難想像、工部局董事額之改變、僅為其先聲而已、</p>

<h3>儒釋道相同之點（二）　賈季英在融五社講詞</h3>
<p>大同說</p>
<p>「儒」戴記禮運篇，孔子曰，大道之行也，天下為公，選賢與能，講信修睦，故人不獨親其親，不獨子其子，使老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長，錄寡孤獨廢疾者皆有所養，男有分，女有歸，貨惡其棄於地也，不必藏於己，力惡其不出於身也，不必為己，是故謀閉而不興，盜竊亂賊而不作，故外戶而不閉，是謂大同。「釋」彌陀經云，彼土何故名為極樂？共國衆生，無有衆苦，但受諸樂，故名極樂。彼佛國土，無三　道，其佛國土，尙無惡道之名，伺况有實？極樂國土，成就如是功德莊嚴。「道」道德經曰，至治之極，鄰國相望，雞狗之聲相聞，民各甘其食，美其服，安其居，樂其俗，至老死不相往來。南華經胠篋篇曰，子獨不知至德之世乎？昔者容成氏，大庭氏，伯皇氏，中央氏，栗陸氏，麗畜氏，軒轅氏，赫胥氏，尊盧氏，祝融氏，伏義氏，神農氏，當是時也，民結繩而用之，甘其食，美其服，樂共俗，安其居，鄰國相望，雞狗之音相聞，民至老死而不相往來，若此之時，則至治也。</p>
<p>責任說</p>
<p>「儒」論語子曰，苟有用我者，期月而已可也，三年有成。論語晨門曰，是知其不可而為之者與？又曰，有心哉，繫磐乎。　語儀封人曰，二三子何患於喪乎，天下之無道也久矣！天將以夫子為木鐸。論語子曰，鳥獸不可與同羣，吾非斯人之徒與而誰與，天下有道，丘不與易也。孟子曰，夫天未欲平治犬下也，如欲平治天下，當今之世，舍我其誰也？叉曰，予豈好辯哉？予不得已也。「佛」金剛經曰，所有一切衆生之類，若卵生若胎生，若濕生，若化生，若有色，若無色，若有想，若無想，若非有想，若非無想，我皆令入無餘湼槃而減度之。觀世昔靈異記曰，觀音大士過去已成止法明如來，逆來示菩薩相，立大願，不度盡衆生，誓不成佛。「道」南華經大宗師曰，浸假而化予之左臂以為鷄，予因以求時夜，浸假而化予之右臂以為彈，予因以求鶚炙，浸假而化予之尻以爲輪，以神爲馬，予因以乘之，豈更駕哉。</p>
<p>死生說</p>
<p>「儒」論語子曰，死生有命，又曰，志士仁人，無求生以害仁，有殺身以成仁。又曰，自古竹有死，民無信不立。孟子曰生亦我所欲也，義亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼，舍生而取義者也。「釋」彌陀經曰，若有善男子，善女子，即說阿彌陀佛，執持名號。……一心不亂，其人臨命終時。……心不顚倒，即得往生阿彌陀佛極樂國土。「道」南華經齊物論曰，予惡乎知說生之非惑耶？予惡乎知惡死之非弱喪而不知　者耶？予惡乎知夫死者不悔其始之蘄生乎？又曰，莫壽乎殤子，而彭祖為夭，天地與我並生，而萬物與我為一。又養生主曰，適來夫子時也，適去夫子順也，安時而處順，哀樂小能人也。古者謂是帝之懸解。又曰，指窮於為薪，火傳也，不知其盡也。又大宗師曰，夫大塊載我以形，勞我以生，佚我以老，息我以死，故善我生者乃所以善我死也。又曰，彼以生為附贅　疣，以死為決　潰癱，夫若然者，又惡知死生先後之所在？</p>
<p>愼獨說</p>
<p>「儒」君子坦蕩蕩，小人長戚戚。戴記大學篇曰，小人間居爲不善，無所不至，見君子而后厭然，拚其不善　者其善，人之視已，如見其肺肝然，則何益矣，此謂誠於中，形於外，故君子必愼其獨也。曾子曰，十目所視十手所指，其嚴乎，富潤屋，德潤身，心廣體胖，故君子必誠其意。又中席篇曰，道也者，不可須臾離也，可離非道也，是故君子戒愼乎其所不諸，恐懼乎其所不聞，莫見乎隱，莫顯乎微，故君子愼其獨也。「釋」心經曰，菩提薩堹，依　若波羅蜜多故，心無罣礙，無　礙故，無有恐怖，遠離顚倒夢想，究竟湼槃，三世諸佛依般若波羅　多故，得阿　多羅三藐三菩提。父老莊為吾國南方學術思潮之代表，孔孟為北方學術思潮之代表，而孔鬥交學科，子游為南派，故不尙者作，子夏為北派，故　作頗富，亦與佛敎天台宗之南頓北漸相同。（完）</p>

<h3>日本財政困窘　又將發新公債　此後消費將至無可再减地步</h3>
<p>著名經濟學專家阿勒斯、昨在英文大美週報上發表評論云、日本已於四月一日進入又一新的財政年、本年爲中日戰爭之第五年、及所謂「新秩序」之第三年、日本財政、現時雖尙可竭澤而漁、未至山窮水盡之地步、但其目下財政情形之捉襟見肘、則已無庸置疑、</p>
<p>人民遭遇　空前負担</p>
<p>東京方面之「新秩序」政策、其意義、目的、與成功、尙在不可知之數、但有一事可以確定者、即此項政策、將使日本人民遭遇空前未有之經濟負担、東京政府之經常收入、甚至不能抵付其支出百分之四十、然則其餘百分之六十、殆非取給於另發公債不可、</p>
<p>對預算案　未敢過問</p>
<p>日本國會方完成其三個月之預算案、其實此種預算、無非欺騙國內人民之官樣文章而已、軍部與極端主義者氣燄甚盛、關於預算案、無人胆敢發作嚴重之批評、至於陸軍與海軍之預算案、以因對華戰爭之預算、則更無人敢加發問、</p>
<p>發動儲金　令購公債</p>
<p>在此情形之下、東京政府不得不發動另一儲金運動，並將以空前之壓力、加諸商民、藉以保留更多之金錢、直　或間接作爲認購公債之需、日本國內人民、此後將不得不將其現有之消費、减至無可再　之地步、此種發展、當然與國家之繁榮、背道而馳也、</p>
<h3>法租界宰猪工人　再度罷工</h3>
<p>搬塲公司工潮延宕</p>
<p>法租界敏體尼蔭路宰牲公司、本地幫宰牲作頭腦陳金海、因與宰牲工人發生猪鬃分配問題之爭執、致遭工人兇毆受傷、行兇工人二名當被巡捕拘獲、該公司全體工人因此突於本月四日、宜吿罷工、工人旋於前晚臨時復工、故昨日法租界尙有鮮肉出售、但昨日工人又復罷工、鮮肉業以工潮僵持、營業無法繼續、特於昨日下午一時、召集緊急會議、商討辦法、但以須與宰作業談判後、始能解決、故當時並無結果、昨據鮮肉業稱、明日（七日）法租界尙可有一部份陳貨應市、但後日（八日）則除少數肉店可向公共租界批購外、其餘或將被迫閉門停業、故法租界居民、將有「食無肉」之感矣、</p>
<p>搬塲汽車</p>
<p>本市友寗·寗波·永安·上天·等四家搬塲汽車公司全體司機、以物價高漲、維生爲艱、曾於日前聯名要求資方增加工資、因資方拒絕、雙方形成僵局、嗣經勞方機聯社出任調解、邀集勞資雙方於本月一日及五日舉行談判、詎資方於兩决談判時、均不出席、致吿失敗、勞方殊表不滿、當於昨晨九時、宜吿罷工、聞其他如中國·茂泰兩公司勞方、因有同盟契的關係、恐亦有波及之虞、</p>
<p>西服</p>
<p>西服業罷工經調解後、四川路及湖北路兩處各西服店、已於本月三日經公共租界工部局政治部派員調解成立、四日一律正式復工、霞飛路西服業、亦巳於前日經勞資談判調解成立、於昨晨起、一律恢復工作、至所有條件、均與四川路等處相同、</p>
<p>履業</p>
<p>製履業工友罷工後、向資方提出加工資三成、茲據大通社記者探悉、因日來米價見跌、祇肯答應加工資二成、勞方未能滿意、故雙方仍在僵持中、惟一部份皮鞋店、巳答允加工資三成故巳復業、其所加工資、則津貼示復工之工友、</p>
<p>秤店</p>
<p>衡器業（即秤店）大部份巳答允酌量增加工資、故當有二十餘家復業、尙有十餘家秤店職工、因資方亦允今日答復酌增工資、故職工於昨晨起、先行復工、</p>

<h3>從統計數字上觀察上海物價</h3>
<p>— 劉鐵孫</p>
<p>糧食品及煤口進口量（單位千公担）</p>
<p>年份　米穀　小麥　麵粉　雜糧　煤斤（千公噸）</p>
<p>從上表觀察，米穀，小麥，麵粉及煤斤之進口量，在戰後非但幷未减少，而且大部份增加，吾人所不能斷定者，在戰前國米，國麥，國粉及國煤之到埠量究有多少，現在之進口量是吾已能抵補國米等因受統制之减少，設或已可抵補，則價値之上漲，並非來源受阻而係受操縱囤集之影響也。</p>
<p>所謂需要增加</p>
<p>溯自戰事西移後，淪陷區域日漸廣大，人民不勝種種煩擾，相率以孤島為安樂窩；房屋問題，大為嚴重，人口一多消費自大，租界頓呈畸形繁榮，爲開埠以來所未有。按戰前本市人口，據上海市年鑒所載有下表：</p>
<p>民國廿五年上海市人口統計（千人）</p>
<p>根據上表在戰前本市人口爲三百八十餘萬，兩特區為一百六十餘萬。最近報章所載公共租界工部局發表統計在公共租界及界外道路之華人的二百萬至二百五十萬之間，外僑的六萬七千，法租界內則的有中外居民二百萬，是則最近兩特區及界外道路之國人及外人的四百十萬至四百六十萬之間，比戰前增加的二倍半至三倍。</p>
<p>所謂通貨膨脹</p>
<p>通貨緊縮則物價下跌，通貨膨脹則物價上漲，二者有聯帶關係。按通貨膨脹不僅紙幣一項，支票—信用膨脹—亦為共一，另一為硬幣，現已不用，可置不論，茲將前二者分別叙述之：</p>
<p>（甲），紙幣膨脹查法幣之發行額據財政部發表：（編者註：附表從略）二十九年六月末之法幣發行額的四十萬萬元，比戰前增加三倍餘。但自戰事發生以來，近遠省份，向用地方鈔或用硬幣者，均陸續以法幣收回，此項需要數量不少；故法幣推行區城旣然擴人，需要亦殷。旣然法幣代替以前流通之硬幣及雜鈔，則現在之增加三倍，是吾係屬膨脹，頗有疑問。</p>
<p>（乙），信用膨脹，信用是吾膨脹，可從上海銀錢二業票據交換之多寡上觀之，（編者註：附表從略），由甘五年之二千二百五十萬元减至廿九年之一千四百五十萬元，故指數由廿五年之一百减爲廿九年之六四分餘。非未膨脹，且呈收縮之態，就各年進退而言：廿六年與廿五年相彷，廿七年票據交換額减少達百分之叫十七，廿八年减少百分之五十以上，廿九年較好，然亦達百分之三十六；但按　數字至十二月已頗好轉，比戰前小過减少百分十五左右，是則信用膨脹之說，不能成立。</p>
<p>綜上而言，信用係呈緊縮，至全國紙幣發行額雖然增加，但尙未達膨脹程度，上海一埠之紙幣流通數量幾何，因無可靠數字，難以判斷。惟江，浙兩省之稍有資產者因淪陷區之困苦，大都携其眷屬與資金而俱來，游資之過剩為前，所未有，據英文商業金融報所載之專家估計，謂上海華人在外國銀行之存款，約合法幣十三萬萬元，內一萬六千萬元左右爲華商銀行之存款，至存儲於華商銀行之存款尙不在內，此項鉅數之游資，設不作經營正當工商業之用，則必流於投機操縱與囤集貨物之途，予物價以直接之威脅矣。</p>
<p>所謂外匯緊縮</p>
<p>外滙緊縮則法幣對外購買力减低，因而物價上漲，茲根據滙豐銀行掛牌之美·英·滙率，幷編製指數列表如下，其指數一項，因與以上各表一致起見，未採用其緊縮之百分數，改用增漲之百分，換言之，即比戰前加多若干倍之法幣，方能換得若干外滙也。</p>
<p>照上列各項數字而言，物價高漲有達九倍以上者，而影響物價高漲之因素所漲之倍數無達五倍者，其癥結所在，厥為游資問題，據專家估計上海各銀行之存款至少在三十萬萬元以上，其中百分之七十以上為活期存款，以致投機囤集事業，頗為風行。吾人根據數字之結論，可謂上海物價之高漲，環境各原因佔其一半</p>
<p>以上表而言二十五六兩年美·英匯均相彷彿，二十七年比二十五年美匯縮百分之四十英滙縮百分之三十八强，二十八年美滙縮百分之一六三，英滙的縮百分之一四〇，二十九年比二十五年所縮之百分數計美滙為四一〇，英滙為二七八，至二十九年十二月份與全年平均亦相差有限，計比二十五年美匯縮百分之四二七，英滙縮百分之三〇〇。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>關於影響物價高漲之原因，吾人旣根據統計數字，觀察如上，茲再將二十六年以萊各年與二十五年比較增减之百分數列表如下，以作一全面之觀察。（下即以二十五年作百分之指數表），而另一半則受操縱之影響，欲謀物價之穩定，兩租租當局應有相當之制止，一方向擁有游資者應放大眼光，勿圖近利，竭澤而漁，在政府方面雖有種種獎勵資金內移之辦法，亦應切實推行，允其應洞悉民瘼，使資金內移，不受阻礙，辦理人員一秉大公，則法令方能與事實相配合，庶能收其實效。如此二方幷進，則上海物價，不難穩定矣。　（續完）</p>
<h3>看到　聽到　想到</h3>

<h3>英德的液體燃料問題　（續三六三期）</h3>
<p>— 農</p>
<p>在戰爭發動前多少年，德國就厲行液體燃料統制政策，限制私人的消耗以加增政府的儲藏量。後來和蘇聯訂了經濟協定，我們叫以想像，一定有一部分是為解決這液體燃料問題的。可是蘇聯究竟能供紟她多少噸？究屬疑問。前年德國大兵東指，把波蘭出為廢壚了，波蘭每年約出產五百萬　的煤油，對於她也不無小補。最近又威迫羅馬尼亞投入她的懷抱，除了小麥，最大目標還是煤油！此外？她又用人工綜合的方法，從煤和石炭中去從煉煤油！她不能不尋找代替品，用酒精或植物油去　替一部分煤油！尤其是從煤和石炭中提煉煤油，是多麼事倍功半，費高　小的工作啊！——據　國Bethune和Lievin地方的兩個人造煤油工廠的報吿，造成的煤油，其代價要比從外國輸入貴八倍到十倍！——這却非在德國的人材技術，和希特勒的雷厲風行獨裁獨斷的瘋在備戰狀况下不能成功！這一方面，德國的確是突飛猛晋有了驚人的進步和發展。然而這也不過是解決了問題的頂小頂小的一部分；要說她人工製造的煤油，巳足敷需要，那尙是不可能的！</p>
<p>就算煤油的採購　人工製造的手續完成了，還有運輸，儲藏，和精製等問題。就運輸問題說，英國力能維持其海上交通，德國則完全在大陸上周轉。儲藏問題的困難，在於液體燃料的組織複雜，而是頗帶危險性的。譬如　煤油的儲　池來說吧，每年至少要把它「翻騰」兩决；盛戰重汽油或飛機汽油的倉庫，也須要精密的設計，安全的地帶；因為你常常要記念着在戰爭時，它是要受到敵人的轟炸和破壞的。精製問題是汽油，特別是飛機汽油，需要有極優良的品質，需要含多量的八炭燒（Octane）。據統計，歐洲各國所出產的煤油，對於精煉成飛機汽油，大概是不够程度的；就是蒸溜，共他各國最優的煤油，飛機汽油的產額也不能超過白分之二十的；所以合用的煤油為數頗少。况說飛機汽油蒸溜成功以後，為的不叫它在燃燒時損毀引擎，還須要加入其他幾種稀看的物質：如異性八炭　（iso—Octane）色，四乙基鉛（Plomb　tetraethile）。　化乙烯（bromure’d’ethylene）。不過化學材料問題，德國大的不成問題。醫如拿飛機汽油需要的澳說吧：在第一次歐戰前，就以她製出的為最多；　她成為問題的，無寗還是汽油的覔得吧。</p>
<h3>統制經濟談片</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>統制經濟組織的起源，是在前次大戰後的種種經濟社會問題所引起產生的結果，但在歷史上的淵源可說早已存在，那末從歷史上去研究統制經濟組織的淵源，可分爲二種：（一）統制經濟組織爲何在一九一八—二〇年能具體形成。（二）此種組織為何使各國產生不同的方向。在前决大戰前，統制經濟的淵源思想山三種思想形成的。（二）以社會主義的運動為發生的基礎；（二）以政治的保守主義為出發點的思想運動。（三）以主張其他方式代替國家組織的思想爲出發點。茲先以社會主義運動解釋一下，社會主義者一向主張以經濟的集合團體，為人類最理想的團體組織，而在社會主義革命運動中常有一口號，即組織社會的勞動者，社會主義旣認為勞動者是根據經濟組織的集合體，換言之，根據經濟組織的團體　其他組織的幽體更為澈底。所以社會主義認為一切團體以無政治上的組織爲原則，庶可希望公共經濟的結合能滿足，公共經濟的生活，從一八八〇年後，社會主義者所採取的立塲，是如何企圖控制議會，以便推翻民主政體，但在一九〇〇年後，社會主義的運動，却不改變其產業社會主義的立塲。此種思想運動的立塲，反映在法國謂工團主義，在英國謂基爾特社會主義，在美國有世界工人會的組織。此三國受產業社會主義思想運動所反映的組織，雖各有不同的志趣，但可歸納在經濟組織上，初期的社會主義的思想。</p>
<p>在一九一五！一六年之間，許多社會興經濟問題隨着戰爭而產生，這許多問題的因素早巳存在，不過因大戰的刺激而更為明顯罷了，戰前的許多現象，在戰時更具體表現出來，在政府方面，覺得非把全國資源加以統制和人類組織力的配合，使對外作戰的目標能充分實現。在德國先喚出一口號，主張組織經濟議會來管理全國經濟，在美國有全國勞工廠和全國貿易局，來統制產業、在英法有經濟顧問委員會的組織，此種組織的工作在使國家工業上所需要的原料能得到供給的來源，使運輸與市塲能得到調整，然德國喚出那口號後，不久即消沉，這完全由於蘇聯一九一七年經濟計劃的影響，當時德國看到布爾雪維克革命的第一步驟，即把全國實業集中起來，其管理大權付託於勞工，同時經濟委員會的委昌制，與德國小同，故德國的口號從此消沉，根據布爾雪維克革侖的第二步驟，即以職業代替國會，此對於資本主義國家，實為一極大的刺激，因此在一九一七年後，各國發生不同的發展，而革命的一派主張對於經濟機構加以改革，甚至於在美國的威爾遜總統也喚出新口號，所謂複元制度，即政治與經濟打成一片，在英法方面亦產生同樣對於經濟統制的呼聲，實際上，統制經濟四個字的意義，在一九一八年所發生的事件，可知對於統制經濟的觀念，產生不同的解釋，有人說，統制經濟是前决大戰前的反民主主義者的一派，有人說，統制經濟是立法與行政間的聯合機關，是顧問機關，換言之，統制經濟是幫助民主主義的發展，或社會主義上實行上的一個過程，使國家在新社會主義基礎推行其政策。</p>

<h3>毛巾</h3>
<p>— 郭秀石</p>
<p>毛巾，係日常必須用品之一，自從　高麗布手巾被淘汰之後，毛巾是很普遍的流行着了。</p>
<p>毛巾輸華，最早者要算是日本貨「鐵錨牌」，品質濃厚，柔軟，故當時國人咸都用之；於民初之時，國貨毛巾問世後，値民四抵制，國人提倡國貨，極為熱烈，當時國貨毛巾，可與舶來品比較者，有「三角牌」毛巾，品質頗為濃厚，而亦柔軟，故當時即受國人熱烈的歡迎，允其是南洋羣島，旅外華僑；自抵制運動以後，國貨毛巾，相繼產生者甚夥，「鐵錨牌」毛巾於不數年中，無形絕跡，這里，國貨毛巾，確能够戰勝外貨，洵為國貨界之偉蹟！</p>
<p>毛巾係純棉織品，而以單紗的為主要，雙股綫織的雖則也有，但是不很普遍，因雙股綫質地堅硬，不合實用；單紗織的毛巾，易於吸水，且又柔軟，故為最普遍。</p>
<p>毛巾有「生紗」「熟紗」的分別：「生紗」毛巾，質地糙硬，落水不吸水，揩起面來，好像魚刺般刺痛皮膚；「熟紗」毛巾則沒有這種弊病，因為熟紗毛巾吸水力很强，落水即沉，揩起面來，柔軟非凡！</p>
<p>「生紗」毛巾與「熟紗」毛巾的鑑別方法，的述如後：</p>
<p>一，請買二條毛巾，一條是「生紗」的，一條是「熟紗」的，請把一點點淸水，（不論冷水熟水）點在二條不同的毛巾上，就可以曉得吸水的是「熟紗」毛巾，水珠子浮起在毛巾紗面上的，便是「生紗」毛巾無疑了。</p>
<p>二，「熟紗」毛巾漂白之後，色澤透明，白嫩，而為鮮美；「生紗」毛巾，雖是同樣漂白，其色澤帶糙，烏，而發呆的。</p>
<p>毛巾的用途，除了主要是揩面之外，如毛巾布料，毛巾被單，毯子，浴巾；又可以毛巾布料，裁製浴衣，睡衣，小孩圍涎，尿布，以至於婦女的月經帶等等，因為毛巾製品，大都是取其柔軟而富於吸水。</p>

<h3>煤商之心黑於煤　煤球暗盤橫漲</h3>
<p>上次煤球每噸立漲四十元、據業中自辯之辭、因安南之鴻基自煤屑、中立國船隻缺乏、水脚激增、運費每噸由美金六元加至十二元之故、然為驟加四十元一噸、適以促成為要求津貼而罷工、蓋廠家祇知保全自己利益、往往原料將漲而煤球先漲、故獲利不貲、忽略工人之生活困難、致有罷工三日之舉、此罷工乃為廠家過分利得之後果、不意因罷工引起一般囤戶之投機、以為罷工結果、必將增加工資影響成本、又須漲價、實則煤球全係機器製造、人工祇運輸、管理、僅佔百分之幾、固亦微乎其微、當不致一漲再漲、因有此囤貨之故、工潮解決、各廠開工、以出淸老棧單爲詞、限制現售、甚至於停止出售、以待善價、致無棧單之本街各店、無貨可售、即僥倖購得、亦以或籮（即五担）爲限、不敷應銷、故日來街頭煤球店、大都空空如也、各煤球廠如此作爲、簡直是不顧、大衆生活、而實行大操縱、大囤積、以便抬高市價之後、好將廠盤再行加高、其用心之陰險、手段之奸猾、無以復加、假使廠家眞個為防杜囤戶起見、則囤戶手中多爲棧單、不應先解棧單、後解現貨、應先應門市銷塲、再行陸續解交棧單、如此則門市有貨可銷、人心不慌、市價不漲、總為一二大廠欲壑難塡、有了千萬要萬萬、假題發揮、橫賺國難財、與囤米同一作風、更有可惡者、故意將津貼問題延不解決、藉此為名、迄未開工、以致煤球產量大見减少、暗盤飛漲此亦有關、甚矣煤商之心甚於煤炭之黑也、（槑）</p>

<h3>生活常識問題</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>任何人都希望有一個健康的身體，然而他們的理想跟他們的生活往往要矛盾的。「要身體健康必須生活有節制，而要生活有節制，必須注意自我訓練及自我犧牲。」這是一位英國名醫依浮皮蒙脫博士Dr．Ivos　Beaumont的忠吿，他並且還有幾組生活上的間題，給我們隨時自己問答，隨時自己省察，對於我們的確可以說有莫大裨益，現在就轉錄在下面：</p>
<p>第一組：關於睡眠方面的。問題有三：一，你能否在任何時間內，不選定甚麽地方，亦可以熟睡？二，在有空襲警報的時候，你能够睡覺嗎？三，早上睡過一夜醒來時，你是吾覺得舒暢？（作者即是名醫，假定你的同答都是反面的，所以接下去的是他替你找出你的原因來或帮助你怎樣糾正）一，這是你不能够把你的一切思想丟棄之故。二，我們應該抱着一種觀念，有空襲警報特睡着總比醒着為快意，那麼你不怕不能睡了。三，一夜睡過醒來時常常不覺得舒暢，逃不了二個原因，睡時室內空氣不流通，否則就是你沒有把日間的煩惱在上床前加以净淸，祗要以後注意睡時睡室的窗戶洞開，及不要上床時還帶着你的煩惱，或者明天開始你就不會在感到不舒暢了！</p>
<p>第二組：關於衣服方面的。問題有二：一，你穿衣服是不是依着氣候而調換的？二，天氣冷得時候，你身上是否仍感到很溫暖？（作者假定你的回答都是正面的，所以接下來不過說了幾句好像解釋的話）一，衣服可以保持一個人的常溫，因此穿衣服絕對須依着氣候而掉換。二，穿緊貼的編織物，外間的風不容易穿入，這樣天氣雖冷，當然你的身上仍舊很溫暖。</p>
<p>第三組：關於　動方面的。問題有三：一，你是否不能夠得到充分運動的機會？二，你歡喜運動嗎？三，在未過份運動前而你的身體已開始疲乏嗎？（這組問題，作者假定你的回答又是反面的；現在他有許多指導給你）已，缺少運動機會的應該每天清晨有五分鐘跳躍般的早操，臨睡前規定十分鐘的散步。二，不喜歡運動的，起初讓自己去選幾種有趣性德運動，或者是參加什麽帶競爭的游戲，慢慢地自然會喜歡的。三，未份運動而身體已開始疲乏的，如果經過醫生的檢騐沒有器官面的疾病，那麽可以把運動的時間遂日增加；開始疲乏時才停止，但是不要怕疲乏而不運動。</p>
<p>第四組：關於飮食方面的。問題有二：一，雖然隔用餐的時候還沒有多久，而你常常是不是父在飢餓了？二，你的食慾是吾不正？（這組問題作者用本位的目光給我們一種簡單的剖解）一，所以有這種現象，大都是因為胃酸過多或有糖尿病的緣故，屬於後者同時體重必减輕。二，胃炎，牙疾，血虧症及大量吸烟都可以引起食慾不正，治療的第一步最後好先請醫生檢騐你的身體，通大便，戒烟亦是必要的。</p>
<h3>提議男子長袍廢止裏襟</h3>
<p>— 黎霞</p>
<p>在衣料的價錢，是相當的可觀，講到衣衫，總得經濟一些。但是處此只重衣衫不重人的上海，過份的破，是不行的呀，即使你自己無愧，却也得到處碰壁。所以，必定要做的話，也得打算一下，不要多剪料子，被裁縫揩油。像我們女子，做三尺半長，剪七尺就够了，但是男子，却就不够；雖然是他們的身圍比較大些，但是另一方面，那裏襟却至少耍佔三尺布，如一元一尺，須三元，那不是比女子多費的嗎？現在男女不是平等嗎？為什麽男子的袍子，無論是單衫，都要加上一個又長又人的裏襟呢？而且，我們來想，一個人的身體，不是一律的嗎？那麼為什麽右半面的身體，特別的要多加一層呢？難道右半面的神經，特別的怕冷呢？况且天天如此，一面多，一面少，對於肺的呼吸與發育，也有相當的妨礙。我們看，西洋人，他們穿的西裝，縫是對開的，絕對沒有那面多那面少的弊病。况且，我也問過多數的男子，他們也覺得這個是贅物，但是習慣是如此的，懶於改罷了。末了，我希望一般有名望的人及長者，以身作則，登高一呼，則羣起效之。况凡百事物，皆隨時代而轉移，知其弊，則改之，又何必默守成見，一成不變呢？此事旣經濟，父衛生，望大家來一個新的改革吧！</p>
<h3>談春筍</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>近的肴饌中，最爲人們所喜吃的，便是春筍，（上海人稱竹筍，也呼淡筍，）因為它的味道鮮美，為仟何素菜中的首屈一指，而且在每樣葷素菜肴中，都可以將它加入，若單獨用油烤，也很够味，佐飯下酒，都很相宜；或用鹽水煮熟晒乾，便是筍乾，可以久藏，和人菜肴或泡湯，別有風味。</p>
<p>俗傳不吃筍的人，不易衰老，但是人們總愛吃它，以其鮮美之故；它的產生時期，在每年的驚蟄後，氣候漸暖，竹園春筍怒茁，這時候鄕人從土中掘出來，負擔入市去賣，在往年筍價最便宜的時候，一角左右可買一斤，木是價廉物美的一種美饌，可是本年百物漲價，蔬菜又受統制，所以近日的筍，每斤還須半元以上，生活高漲，連筍也將吃不起了。</p>
<h3>醬油可治胃病</h3>
<p>— 白馬</p>
<p>讀上期本欄靑聰君「醬油與胃病」一文，覺頗多異乎吾所聞之處，似不能不略述數語。醬油之製法，其實不止二類，計有四類：一爲古法釀造，須夏季製之；二爲改良法，不靠天然霉而用麴菌，任何時可釀；三爲速釀法，可以加溫而短縮期間；四爲化學法，製成一種稱「阿米諾酸」的鮮汁，爲極濃厚之補品。徐卓呆先生所著「醬油經」中，關於醬油常識，論之綦詳。此四種，不但無害，而且滋補，併可治胃病糖尿病脚氣病心臟病等等。至於調味粉之　渣殘液，徐先生稱之爲假醬油，本不列於四種醬油之內。世人不察，以此假醬油，亦目爲化學醬油，不但名義大誤，而性質亦大有霄襲之別。蓋化學醬油爲大補藥，而假醬油實不合衛生也。化學醬油，雖亦用鹽酸提煉，而所用者，爲合成鹽酸，用「鈉」中和後，即無酸性：而調味粉之製造，往往不用合成鹽酸而用工業鹽酸，工業鹽酸，乃由硫酸改製而成，雖經中和，而硫酸中之雜質頗多，此實有損無益也。故並非醬油本身有害，而有害者，爲假醬油耳</p>
<h3>談窮</h3>
<p>— 左傳</p>
<p>「闊老」談窮，總不免有點「隔靴搔癢」之感；而以一個「窮小子」來談窮，却是再「體貼也不過的了。權充」序一。</p>
<p>提起窮，可眞化點「寒酸」相：人家總三句不離跳舞，二聲不說電影；「正經」一點，也耍口口「吃進」，聲聲「拋出」……如果束緊腰帝，啞着喉嚨喊「抑平米價」，巳經是不大「漂亮」了；又何况公然向大庭廣衆談窮？</p>
<p>「惡形」透了！</p>
<p>不過「惡形儘管惡形，窮勁我自為之。」且「老老臉皮」冉談！</p>
<p>先拉一句俗語來：「綱不搭布，窮不搭富。」這「搭」的意義，就是「不可同日而語也」！如果要硬挨進去，就不免有蚍蜉撼大樹」，不自量力之譏了！</p>
<p>因此，「闊老」儘可放心，決不敢有捋「虎鬚」，而「自討沒趣」的！我談　談窮人的事：</p>
<p>咱們窮人，人家總說是生就的一付「骨頭」；說呢，也不錯：臉頰瘦的，四肢細的，顏色菜黃的，肚子則空空如也。而走起路來，往往要彎背低頭，躡手躡脚。（其實，這是因爲在挺胸凸肚，昂首高步的「闊老「面前　得一相形見絀」罷了！）因此，窮人又常常被人家駡作「賤相」，上不得「塲面」……當然，與「細皮」包「白肉」的「富骨頭」是不可以「搭」的！</p>
<p>至於說到窮人在一貧如洗的時候，那倒眞有點「難為情」：肚子能用不「科學」來充實，吃是無論如伺　　的。從喝粥湯釗啃大　，從啃人餅到灌開水……再不然，身上棉的剝下來，夾的勉强穿穿；夾的剝下來，向被窩裏一鑽了之！反正不到馬路上去「出醜」　得了，「五臟廟」是賣了兒女也要「修的！</p>
<p>窮人一天到晚也得「窮忙」，，卽使空下來，可也沒有一福氣」去「义」，去看，去玩，去……這些都是「闊老」的「專利品」；窮人的唯一「消遺」是和一家老小開「衣食會議」，主張以「精神替代物質」……不行，凍餓比死都難受！與其坐以　斃，不如挺而走險。窮極了，搶！</p>
<p>到那個時候，哼！却不會管你什麽「闊老」「赤老」了！</p>
<p>糟糕，談窮又談到了「闊老」，眞是「江山易改，本性難移。」窮人就是嘴硬的「不好」</p>
<p>「那能介勿寫意格？」</p>
<p>那末，旣然「自討沒趣」，就「免開窮口」啦……</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>近來魚類價格，仍以黃魚爲最便宜，你出輔幣兩角，已可買到一尾相當大的黃魚了。黃魚的做法很多，最普通的是紅燒，醋溜，葱煎，或將雪菜切細，與它一同淸燉，無論整尾的，或切塊的都可，不必用醬油，只須白湯，其味很鮮，此外更有麵炸黃魚，把魚切了塊，先在醬油中浸過片刻，然後拖了麵漿油炸，下酒最為相宜。筆者允其愛吃的，却是黃魚羹，先將黃魚蒸熟出骨，略用醬油陳酒，和以莧菜筍丁，一同紅燒，如不用醬油，則可略加食鹽，白燒亦可。吃時稍加胡椒末，其味無窮。目前莧菜尙不上市，可以萵苣葉代用，也是淸香可口的。</p>

<h3>一個片「行」爲中心的民族</h3>
<p>— 陽新</p>
<p>在我國西南一帶的崇山峻嶺中，住着多少奇特的民族，苗人，猺人，或夷人。過去為了種族的成見，仇恨及猜忌，漢人和他們接觸的機會很少，對於生活方面，我們所知道的，只有些類乎神話的傳說。直到最近，國人才開始注意起來。這裹我要介紹的是：以「行」為生活中心的夷族古宗人。</p>
<p>古宗人分佈區域，以雲南省的中甸，德欽，巴安一帶為中心。生來是一個健壯高大的身體，善走耐苦。從小就學會了放牲口，燒飯，搭帳篷的本領，騎馬，打槍，更是拿手好戲。他們就靠了這些特長，往來於康藏，與橫斷山脈之間做買賣。把漢人的茶糖等，運到西藏，再把那裹的藏絨，毛織物之類運回來。一轉手中，獲利甚大，因此成了一個很富的民族。</p>
<p>他們的食，「糌耙」和酥油茶是日常的食品。「糌粑」這名詞，聽起來十分陌生，原來由「靑粿」製成的，吃時加上酥油茶用手拌勻。酥油茶是在茶中加食鹽和酥油混合而成，稍帶腥味。古宗人把它待客，作爲一種不成文的常禮。無疑的，他們的食品，也和生活有關，只要背囊中裝上「　粑」，一塊磚茶，食鹽和酥油，便什麽地方都去得。講到營養料，還十分豐富呢！</p>
<p>衣的力面，色彩大都是紫色，我想這和叫周的環境，高山荒漠的調子，大有關係。衣服名叫「礎襬」，由西藏毛織物做成，又寬又大，上半截平常多束在腰間，是晴雨衣，也是睡覺的被窩。</p>
<p>住：因為他們是一支旅行的民族，對於住的問題不十分注意。普通的房屋，都用木板搭成，分上下兩層，上層住人，下層住牲畜，人由院中短梯上走上去。古宗人大概還保持游牧民族的特性，愛護牲畜，和它們同住？但因那邊氣候寒冷，不致有什麽氣味。在旅行時間，搭着帳幕歇宿，和童子軍營帳一樣，隨時可以遷移着，十分便利。</p>
<p>最後要說到他們的貿易路綫，是東穿　斷山脈抵康定，西經橫斷山脈過草地到拉薩，沿途所經，很多有名難以通過的地方，但古宗人却如履平地般通過了。啊！好一個饒有詩　而冒險的民族！</p>

<h3>高</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>高，衆所歸望。</p>
<p>「低能兒」想爬高，想升高，想跳高；「　三」想做「少爺」，「少爺」想做「大爺」，「大爺」則想做「高等華人」，一「高」以後，那末「年高德劭」啦，「德高望重」啦，自然就會「高」戴冠上。</p>
<p>高，又是衆所歸「爲」。</p>
<p>可是人終究祇有六七尺高，做到「九尺偉丈夫」已經難乎其難了，至於「丈二和尙」到底是「摸不着頭腦」的。</p>
<p>於是得想法子如何使自己「高」起來，高於一切……</p>
<p>所謂「天下無難事，祗怕有心人。」所以「有心」的人就一定有法子；法子來了，把衆人墊在他的脚底下，連喝口粥的權利都沒有，而自己却「高高」居上。</p>
<p>不過這「墊脚」是否可靠，也有問題，因為壓力愈大，其反抗力也愈「高」！</p>
<h3>四月四日那一天</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>大虎在做夢。他碰到從來沒有的好運氣：垃圾堆裏滿是銅子，黃澄澄地發亮的銅子！他一個勁兒的拾着。拾呀拾的，他的那個破筐子給裝得滿滿了，溢出來了，還是拾不完。銅子愈弄愈多……</p>
<p>可是一陣哭聲把他吵醒了！</p>
<p>他睜開半隻眼。才十三歲的姊姊坐在一隻矮櫈上流眼淚。兩肩一抽一抽的，像一個婆娘一般哭着。她的臉上，手上，幾處淌着血。</p>
<p>「不能怪『那摩溫』！一定是你自己不好，才會三日兩頭吃生活。還哭×！」爸爸怒吼着。</p>
<p>大虎馬上明白了那是怎麼一回事。他一骨碌的打泥地跳起，低着頭跑到牆角，拿了放在那裏的兩件傢伙，就向門外跑去。</p>
<p>門前，二虎正跟小虎在玩耍。二虎腮巴上塗滿着烏泥，手裏的泥團抹着小虎的臉。小虎咧開小嘴嘻嘻地傻笑。</p>
<p>天氣很好。初春的，早晨的風帶着點寒意吹拂着大虎的臉。大虎深深地吸了口氣，立刻一股難聞的氣息冲入他的鼻子裏。那邊，製罐廠旁的那棵柳樹早已披上了一襲輕飄的新綠的上衣。廠前已有好多女人在洗刷髒鉛皮了。大虎望得見他的低着頭在做工的媽媽。</p>
<p>不知怎麽的，大虎突然覺得媽媽可憐，姊姊，二虎，小虎，都可憐。也許爸爸也可憐，可是他不大喜歡爸爸。爸爸太會發怒，待他們四個，待媽媽，都小好！</p>
<p>接着，他又想起家裏那座幾塊破磚砌成的灶這時還是冰冷的。番薯皮靜靜地躺在地上。過一會，小虎準得哭，鬧着要吃番薯皮糊……</p>
<p>跑近垃圾堆，大虎的心禁不住怦跳起來了。耍是，要是眞的碰到這樣好運氣，姊姊，媽媽，……連爸爸也用不到賣「豆腐花」了！這邊矮房子裏的人們都把垃圾伸倒在這裏。而那邊大洋房的不也是嗎？也許，那個穿白飯單的大司務一個不留神，把錢一起倒……</p>
<p>想着，想着，大虎彎下身去。手裏的鐵傢伙在垃圾堆裏儘鑽，儘挑。沒多久，他覺得觸到一點什麼了。他的手開始哆索。那會是什麽呢？</p>
<p>他很快的把那上面的煤渣，廢紙，果皮，……扒開，睜大了兩眼瞧：「媽的！一個小崽子！」</p>
<p>啐的吐了口唾沫，他又扒起來。沒有！一個也沒有！那個「小崽子」可儘拿一對死眼睛盯着他。春蠅在它的稻草似的亂髮上飛鳴。</p>
<p>馬路上傳來一串歌聲：「呵呵，這樣一個好世界，正是我們的！美麗又寬大！兄弟呀，姊妹呀，這是我們的！…」</p>
<p>大虎索性小扒了，衝過去瞧。</p>
<p>四十多個跟他差不多大小的孩子：男的，女的，兩人一排；像一條蛇一般，走着，唱着。打頭的那一個還拿着一面小旗子。旁邊走着兩個戴眼鏡的男女。</p>
<p>「遊戲吧！慶祝吧！這是我們的！啦，啦，啦，啦！」</p>
<p>突然有誰撞一下大虎，飛也似的跑過去了。大虎瞧是個臭小子。馬上後面響起一陣皮靴聲：一個胖巡捕！</p>
<p>大虎一閃閃到了對面。望着。</p>
<p>胖巡　在拐角那裏抓着了那個孩子，重重地給了一個耳括子。孩子幌了幾下，鼻子流出血來，大虎發見馬路那邊停着部黑車子。</p>
<p>他連忙拐個　，在一家門口坐下了。聽得肚子咕嚕地叫起來。</p>
<p>太陽　朗地照着。風散播着溫暖。從那邊傳來那漸漸遠去的歌聲：</p>
<p>「呵呵，這樣一個好世界，正是我們的！美麗又寬人！兄弟呀，姊妹呀，這是我們的！啦，啦，啦，啦！…」</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（六）　愛情結晶品</p>
<p>「我目己也實在沒有辦法，一顆心簡直從沒有回到北京去過。這短短的幾天，在我眞像過了幾十平一樣。」秋海棠手裏　着一杯那個啞丫頭才遞給他的淸茶，目不稍　地看定着湘綺。</p>
<p>湘綺不覺慢慢　垂下了頭去。</p>
<p>「如果你眞担心他會來的話，我今晚便依舊回去吧！」秋海棠把右脚踏在戶限上，上身微俯，雙手捧定了那個茶杯，眼睛從湘綺的身上移到了外面的庭心裏去。</p>
<p>這是第二進屋子和第三進屋子中間的一個小犬井，裹面種着許多菊花，一頭小花貓正伏在遍晒着陽光的花台上陲覺。</p>
<p>「這父何必呢？」湘綺也慢慢地站到了長窗邊來。一旣然來了，讓我們忘記了一切，快快樂樂的過幾天吧！……誰也不知道這種日子能有多少呢……！」</p>
<p>說到這一句話，湘綺和秋海棠不由　時苦笑了一笑。</p>
<p>可是以下的兩天倒的確過得很快活，那個啞丫頭顯然也知道了他們的心事了，軟待秋海棠幾乎比湘綺還要殷勤。第三天晚上，秋海棠還在湘綺的臥室裏發現了一幅新繡的秋海棠，端端正止地掛在靠沂鐵牀那一邊牆壁上，配着非常精緻的鏡框和彩鬚，使他感激得幾乎掉下眼淚來。</p>
<p>「最難消受美人恩」，秋海棠隨手取過一支鉛筆來，在一張剛撕下的日曆的背後，縱橫上下的把這句詩寫了一二十遍，還沒有把筆放下。</p>
<p>湘綺就在旁邊瞧着，不由側着頭噗哧一笑。</p>

<h3>關於王杜的慘死</h3>
<p>— 茜蒂</p>
<p>王艷琴與杜鴻賓的慘死，是一幕戲，是一個悲劇！他們的本身，都有缺點，然而也都非常可愛。他們是靑年，他們是有血有肉有靈魂有情感的靑年，靑年就不該沈湎情塲，不該徘徊歧途，更不該以自己的手傷害自己的生命！這是我個人從他們的「慘死」所引起的，在「嘆惜」，「同情」以外的一點感想。</p>
<p>這一件情殺案，表面看來，似乎很平凡，其實仔細想來，並不平凡。</p>
<p>類似王艷琴的那種天眞而却是幼稚可憐的女孩子，在這社會裏，眞是多着；像杜鴻賓的那種聰明而却是同樣幼稚可的憐靑年，在這社會裏，也絕對不少。所以這應該說是一個社會問題，一個可怕的嚴重的社會問題。</p>
<p>「誰殺害了他們？」許多人都這樣詢問着，懷疑着。</p>
<p>王艷琴非常天眞，然而她有缺點；杜鴻賓非常聰明，然而他也有缺點，他們不能共同克服這個缺點，因此便造成了慘死，不幸的慘死，全無價値的慘死！</p>
<p>我在訪問王艷琴的家族的時候，她的父親王筱　就流着眼淚說：</p>
<p>「我很歡喜艷琴，她聰明，她天眞，她活潑，然而她缺少的是沒有好好地受過敎育」</p>
<p>杜鴻賓的業師劉子雲也說</p>
<p>「鴻賓很早就失去父母的敎養，他十五歲到我的班子裏來學戲，人很聰明，敎一樣，懂一樣，甚至不去敎他，他私下裹自己也會偷偷學習，這種刻苦自勵的精神，是很不容易的，就是他同艷琴認識以後，她也時常去敎艷琴的戲，並且還競勵她讀書識字，然而鴻賓缺少的是沒有判斷一件事悄輕重的頭腦，他只是逞一時的情感衝動，便行兇在先，自戕於後，這是錯誤之至。」</p>
<p>從他們的談吐中，我倒可以知道他們死的原因是：「幼稚」，他們死後給人的印象是：「可憐」！</p>
<p>我們希望一般人對於這一件情殺案，要有明確的觀點，不僅看作爲「談說笑笑」的故事而已，而應該藉此相互警惕，切實地記起靑年人的責任！</p>

<h3>Outbreak of a Major Balkan War: German Forces Simultaneously Invade Greece and Yugoslavia; Ultimatum Issued to Both Countries Yesterday Morning; Italy Also Declares Assistance to Germany in the War</h3>
<p>New York: NBC received a Berlin radio broadcast this morning stating that Germany is in a state of war with Yugoslavia as of Sunday morning. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This radio station broadcast a message at 6:45 AM today, stating that German troops, under the command of Führer Hitler, have invaded Greece and Yugoslavia and are now advancing. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens: The official announcement stated that German army units simultaneously attacked our country's Serres and Eastern Macedonia at 5:15 AM this morning. At 5:30 AM, the German Minister Heerenburg visited our Foreign Minister, stating that British troops had landed in Greece, and German troops had no choice but to enter Greece. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Minutes after the German invasion of Yugoslavia, the official announcement here stated that Britain is determined to assist Yugoslavia in the war with all its strength. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: According to semi-official sources here, the Turkish government is expected to issue a declaration today regarding the German invasion of Yugoslavia, clarifying its stance. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome: This radio station recently announced that the Italian army, navy, and air force are determined to join forces with the German army to attack Yugoslavia. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The Berlin radio station recently announced that Italian aircraft have also been dispatched to bomb Yugoslav military targets. Germany has also sent many aircraft to bomb British escort ships in the Mediterranean, sinking a 3,000-ton cargo ship. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens: King George II of Greece recently issued a proclamation to the public, stating that the United Kingdom and the United States are powerful and will fight alongside us to defeat the isolated German army. Victory is assured. Greece and Yugoslavia are interdependent, and our country will certainly fight alongside them to the end. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Vichy: A German government spokesman in Berlin stated yesterday that Germany has practically no diplomatic contact with the Southern government. All the results of the new government in the South are merely acts of increasing hatred towards Germany and Italy. Anti-German demonstrations are still developing, and the Southern government has not taken clear and effective measures to stop them. This is what Germany sees as the fact. The Italian Consul General and staff in Zagreb have already departed, and German consuls in several places have also left. It was heard yesterday that Bulgaria and Hungary have begun to discuss the possibility of jointly demanding a revision of the border from the Southern country. According to reliable unofficial sources in the Southern capital, diplomatic talks on this matter are actively underway in the Bulgarian and Hungarian capitals. Southern capital observers believe that this move is perfectly in line with Bulgaria's past history, so they believe that the people of the Southern country will not find it strange. According to news from Rome, the Romanian cabinet now feels it is necessary to assure the people that the presence of German troops in the country will not affect the food supply, so it issued a public statement announcing that the supplies for German troops in Romania come directly from Germany, and the shortage of certain items in Romania cannot be attributed to the German troops. The Romanian cabinet has now added a Minister of Supply and has strengthened the punishment for those who engage in economic sabotage, speculation, and hoarding. The rumor that Southern expatriates are now leaving Romania is said to be inaccurate. The Southern Embassy in Romania stated that there is no order for people from the South to leave the country. The recent rumors from Berlin that telegraph and telephone communications between Bulgaria and Romania have been interrupted have not been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Germany Sends a Declaration of War to Greece and Yugoslavia, Accusing Them of Cooperating with Britain</h3>
<p>Berlin: The content of the German government's declaration of war to the Yugoslav government is roughly as follows: German files seized in Charité, France, revealed that "responsible persons in the Southern country assured the French Minister to the Southern country in June 1940, when France collapsed, that if the French situation improved, the Southern country would join hands with France." The document continued, stating that after Yugoslavia joined the Tripartite Pact, the Axis powers guaranteed its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the Axis powers did not ask the Southern country to allow troops to pass through or provide military assistance. Germany and Italy's invitation for the Southern country to join the Tripartite Pact was intended to have Yugoslavia cooperate with other European countries to prevent the expansion of the war. Unexpectedly, after the political change in Yugoslavia, the new rulers issued a general mobilization order. British staff officers went to Belgrade daily to serve as liaison officers. At the same time, the Southern country's General Staff also sent a delegation to Greece to contact the British army. The German government has now obtained evidence that Simović called on the Allies, requesting military and financial assistance to Yugoslavia, using "Yugoslavia fighting against Germany" as bait. It is obvious that the Southern country is providing the enemy with a base for attacking Germany. Therefore, the German government decided to send troops to maintain law and order. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German note to the Southern government is accompanied by a twenty-page memorandum, divided into four sections. The final section details the recent incidents of abuse of German expatriates and Germans in the Southern country. The German government, in view of the fact that the Southern country's authorities cannot or are unwilling to suppress these illegal acts, has no choice but to force German expatriates to leave the Southern country to avoid further innocent danger. In short, the facts show who should be responsible for this unfortunate development. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, representing the German government, declared this morning that Germany, in view of the actions and attitudes of the governments of Yugoslavia and Greece, had no choice but to send troops to the two countries. The German government simultaneously published this morning the note and ultimatum to the Greek government, as well as the declaration and ultimatum to the Yugoslav government. The note to the Greek government stated, "Greece abandoned its neutrality at the beginning of the war in September 1939, initially secretly, and later openly siding with Germany's enemy, Britain." To confirm this, the German government specifically published the files previously seized in France, which clearly revealed the intentions of the Greek government. The most noteworthy of these is General Yiganmulin's note, which stated, "The Greek General Staff has notified us that if Greece can obtain sufficient assistance from the air force and anti-aircraft guns, it will be able to guarantee the landing of Allied expeditionary forces and their advance to Thessaloniki." The German ultimatum continued, stating that the German government advised the Greek Minister to Germany in August 1940 to urge the Greek government to abandon its pro-British sentiments, but the Greek government turned a deaf ear and did not approach Germany to restore Greece's neutral status. After British troops landed in Greece, Britain established a new front against Germany in Greece, just like during the last World War. It is now known that the British army's command in Greece has made contact with the Yugoslav General Staff. Therefore, Germany can no longer tolerate it. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: In addition to sending a note to Greece, the German government also attached a ten-page memorandum, divided into five sections, detailing Greece's pro-Allied and pro-French attitude, and listing the advice that the German government had given to Greece. The latter part also mentioned Hitler's speech on January 30 this year, which clearly stated that Germany would never allow British troops to occupy Greek territory. Unexpectedly, the Greek government ignored this and instead invited Allied forces to continue to enter the country. The German government, witnessing the increasing number of British troops in Greece, had no choice but to recognize Greece as an enemy of Germany. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Encourages Soldiers to Protect Southeast European Interests</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, reading on the radio the Führer's letter to German soldiers on the Southeast front, stated in essence that German soldiers on the Southeast front are now at a time to serve the country, protect Germany's interests in Southeast Europe, and begin heroic combat, just like the great achievements that German soldiers completed in Norway and on the Western Front last year. You will certainly be able to fight a victorious war in that region, just like the German troops did in the autumn of 1915. If the enemy treats you with kindness, you should repay them with kindness. If the enemy exposes their bestial nature, you should strike them hard. The war against Greece is not a war against the Greek people, but against our common enemy. Germany will still fight alongside its allies in that region, so that the British will encounter another "Dunkirk" fate. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Southern King Issues Mobilization Order, Suspends Train Service for Military Use</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital: The wording of the mobilization order issued by King Peter I of Yugoslavia is as follows: "I, mindful of the grace of God and the will of the people, based on the recommendation of the Minister of Defense and the Minister of the Navy, and after discussing with all cabinet members, have decided to mobilize the entire national army and take a state of alert. I have authorized the Minister of Defense and the Minister of the Navy to implement this order." Another decree stipulates that train service is suspended for military use, and private vehicles have also been requisitioned for temporary military use. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>British, Greek, and Southern Troops Concentrated on the Greek-Southern Border</h3>
<p>Berlin: The Berlin radio station recently broadcast a message stating that British, Greek, and Yugoslav troops have been concentrated at the border between Greece and Yugoslavia in accordance with the joint defense plan. According to news from Romania, British troops continue to land in the Thessaloniki area of Greece.

<p>London: It is heard here that the Berlin radio station recently claimed that British submarines and aircraft have departed from the Southern country's territorial waters and airfields for combat. The first British aircraft arrived in Yugoslavia on Friday, and British air force personnel have replaced Southern personnel at the Southern country's airfields. British submarines are using the ports of Kotor and Dubrovnik on the Adriatic Sea in southwestern Southern country as their bases. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>New Opportunities Evolving into a World War</h3>
<p>The Balkan Peninsula is connected to the European continent in the north and extends into the center of the Mediterranean Sea in the south. Small countries abound, various ethnic groups coexist, and resources are abundant, forming a distinct region in Europe. The Axis powers regarded this as an object that must be controlled without bloodshed, and from the beginning, they did not choose this as a battlefield, especially hoping that the war would not affect it. Even though Italy rashly attacked Greece, making a big mistake, the Nazis did not change their original intention of managing the Balkans with peaceful political means. Just as Yugoslavia was about to kiss the poisoned bait, a sudden change occurred, and the situation changed abruptly. The subsequent development over the course of the following ten days proved that the Nazis no longer had room for clever acquisition. Therefore, the only path ahead was either to admit defeat and voluntarily withdraw, or to make other arrangements and engage in combat. Observing the general situation, it is almost inevitable that the war will extend to the Balkans, and its outbreak is not far off.</p>
<p>After the Yugoslav political change, there was no clear indication of its attitude towards Germany, which aroused suspicion among some people. In fact, if the authorities in the South were still going to fulfill their obligations to adhere to the Axis powers, wouldn't the political change be superfluous? Only because the political situation had just been changed, everything was waiting to be arranged, and the internal ethnic minority issues had not been properly arranged, it was necessary to temporarily delay the German offensive with an ambiguous attitude. In the past day or two, the Croat ethnic group has decided to cooperate, and its leader has joined the new government. The United Kingdom, the United States, Greece, and other countries have also encouraged or guaranteed it. Even in the Soviet Union, it not only congratulated the King of the South on his ascension to the throne but also concluded a non-aggression pact with him, which is an important factor in ensuring the courage of the Southern country to resist foreign aggression. Its military mobilization and the adoption of a state of preparation are the prelude to the clarification of the Southern country's attitude towards Germany. If the German side had not hesitated or expected something, the two sides would have already met in battle.</p>
<p>Judging from the military situation between Germany and the South, the Southern country is clearly at a disadvantage. Since Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria successively sided with Germany, the Southern country's border, except for the 200 kilometers facing the sea in the west and bordering Greece, is almost surrounded by the Nazis and their allies on three sides. Although its own terrain is mostly mountainous and dangerous, it is偏in the southeast corner. The areas bordering Austria, Hungary, and Romania are plains that are conducive to mechanized units. In addition, the capital of the Southern country is only more than 70 kilometers away from the border of Hungary, and the entire Danube River basin is extremely convenient for the German army to invade. If the German army invades via Hungary, the defense of the Southern country will be extremely difficult. This may be the reason why Germany recently intensified its pressure on Hungary, which led to the suicide of Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki. However, the people of the Southern country are determined to resist the enemy and are brave and good at fighting. If they can cooperate well with the Greek army and the British troops that have landed, drive the remaining Italian forces out of Albania as soon as possible, and then rely on the dangerous terrain to resist strongly, just like the resistance against the Austrian army in the last war, even if the German army invades, it will be difficult to exert the effect of blitzkrieg and quick victory, and it will evolve into a long and arduous battle. This not only puts Germany at risk of fighting on two fronts but also disturbs its rear warehouses. Regardless of the outcome, it is more harmful than beneficial.</p>
<p>Germany's strategy against Britain is to either capture the island of Britain or to cut off and disrupt the United Kingdom's overseas transportation and material supply. Prior to this, Hitler had tried his best to avoid expanding the war in the Balkans, with the intention of concentrating all his strength in order to attack Britain. Now that Germany has been forced to use troops in the Balkans and has no certainty of victory in attacking Britain, it will probably change its military strategy and repeat the old tune of invading the Near East. The eastward advance of the German-Italian joint forces in Libya and the southward advance of the German forces in the Balkans. This situation of distant mutual echo is clearly a concrete and micro-representation of the once-touted pincer offensive against British territories in the Near East. After the outbreak of the German-Southern war, the German army will definitely not limit its military operations to a corner of the Southern country. It will definitely go straight to Thessaloniki in order to advance to Greece and seize the opportunity to advance. At that time, Turkey will find it difficult to continue to stand by, and from then on, the Balkans will become a battlefield for the two forces to engage in fierce battles.</p>
<p>If we leave the purely military point of view and observe from the political aspect, the future development contains many complex factors that are worth noting. First, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the European war, even if it is still too early to assert that it has undergone a 180-degree turn, the object of the current non-aggression pact has shifted from the Axis powers to the anti-Axis powers. Its attitude towards Turkey and the South is already the same as its attitude towards Germany at the beginning of the European war. When the war has already expanded to the Balkans and is about to approach the Soviet Union's Black Sea gateway, the subsequent dynamics and trends of the Soviet Union are a very interesting issue. Second, when Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka went from the Allies to Berlin, it is said that he said that if Japan encounters other countries interfering in its foreign policy, it will fight them. Although this statement is more passive, it is also quite flexible. The Balkan war is not beneficial to the Axis powers, and the Japanese authorities, who are eager for quick success and instant benefit, may not regard it as a good opportunity to launch new adventures. Third, the competition between the warring countries in Europe is gradually expanding beyond Europe and Africa. The United States' confiscation of German and Italian ships is an act to help democratic countries, and the strikes in some American factories related to military supplies, in addition to the disputes between labor and management themselves, also clearly involve the fifth column, in order to delay the production of war materials to aid Britain. In Asia Minor, a sudden political change in Iraq, the new regime may not be completely pro-Axis, but it gives Britain a major restraint. However, the strength of German and Italian activities in various Arab tribes in recent years should not be underestimated. These trends will inevitably develop further with the outbreak of the Balkan War, which is the prelude to the expansion of the European War into a world war.</p>
<h3>Greek Prime Minister Determined to Fight for Independence Against German Invasion</h3>
<p>Berlin: Reports from the Bulgarian capital state that the ports of Kotor and Dubrovnik in Yugoslavia have allowed British submarines to use them as bases. The first British aircraft were transported to the Southern country yesterday. The Southern army has been ordered to treat all British troops as friends. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens: Prime Minister Corizis, after receiving notification from the German Minister here today that German troops had advanced into Greece, declared, "Greece is fighting for independence and will resist every attack by German troops." The German Minister told the Greek Prime Minister that the reason why German troops attacked Greece was because British troops had landed in Greece. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Budapest: The Lloyd newspaper here stated yesterday that Hungary, in view of Yugoslavia's military preparations, has implemented military precautionary measures. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Southern Government Notifies Officials to Prepare to Move to Designated Location</h3>
<p>New York: An American radio station recently broadcast a telegram from the capital of Yugoslavia stating that General Simović, the prime minister of the Southern cabinet, has notified all government officials to remain in the capital tomorrow so that they can move immediately upon notification. However, it is still unknown where they will move to. It is probably somewhere in the Serbian province of the South. In addition, many squadrons of the Yugoslav Air Force flew to the north today. It seems that the stage of diplomatic negotiations has passed, and a new stage will begin in a few hours. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Has Dispatched Aircraft to Bomb Southern Railways and Airfields</h3>
<p>Berlin: German bombers attacked enemy troop trains on a section of the Danube River. Several carriages and a section of the railway track were destroyed. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A Haitong News Agency reporter learned from responsible sources this afternoon that German fighter planes and dive bombers are attacking Yugoslavia's airfields, military camps, and other important military facilities, shooting down ten Southern planes.

<h3>It Is Said That All Troops on the Southern Border Will Resolutely Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>Capital of the Southern Country: There was an air raid alarm here this morning, but only enemy planes were seen circling in the sky, and no bombs fell. It is said that all armies on the Southern border resolutely resisted the German invasion everywhere. The blitzkrieg began at dawn. When German troops advanced on the Southern country's roads where mines were buried, the sound of artillery and explosions were deafening. The first target of the German troops was clearly Nis, an important railway junction on the Morava River. It is said that the Southern army is fighting hard against the German forces and will not give up an inch of land easily. German troops also advanced on the railway in the Vardar River basin, which is strategically important because it is a shortcut to Thessaloniki. Many mechanized units of the British army are gathered in Thessaloniki. Rumors are rife in the capital, saying that Turkey is prepared to send troops across the Thracian border to attack the German army's flank, and that the Soviet Union may urgently provide material assistance to Greece and the South. Just before the German attack, the Southern army leaders told the cabinet that if the cabinet could not firmly reject Germany's demands, the Southern army was prepared to take matters into its own hands. The sound of anti-aircraft guns around the capital was incessant like thunder, but no bombs fell in the capital. (International News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Germany Attacks Southern Central Cities From Southern Bulgaria</h3>
<p>London: A well-informed foreign diplomat told reporters from multiple agencies at 10:45 AM today that Germany's attack on Yugoslavia began from the Struma sector in southern Bulgaria. The goal of the attack is the strategically important city of Skopje in the southern center of Yugoslavia. The results of this attack can achieve the following goals simultaneously: covering the rear of the Italian army in Albania, cutting off a large part of the troops in northern Southern country, isolating them from Greece, and expanding the front line to a place where Greece can be attacked. It was recently reported that British motorized units are stationed in Tovuzelia, on the Southern-Greek border. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Hull Confer on the Issue of Providing Aid to Greece and the South</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of the Navy Knox confirmed this morning that the United States would provide aid to the Southern country at the fastest rate possible. The U.S. State Department and officials from Greece and the South here declined to comment on the German invasion. However, Southern advisor Reber said, "This invasion has long been expected." Furthermore, U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull spoke by phone this morning. It is understood that due to Germany's invasion of Greece and the South, the topic of discussion was related to the United States' immediate aid to the two countries. (International News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull left the Gridiron Club banquet last night after hearing the first urgent telegram about Germany's war with Yugoslavia and Greece. They rushed back to their offices. This morning, under the light of the lamp, senior officials from the main departments of the State Department and the White House had gathered. President Roosevelt and Hull were also in their respective offices. When news of the German invasion came last night, the ambassadors of Yugoslavia and Greece to the United States were also present at the banquet in addition to President Roosevelt and Hull. The President had just heard the news that the Southern country and the Soviet Union had concluded a non-aggression pact, and by the end of the banquet, he heard the news of the German invasion of Greece and the South.

<h3>British General to Offer Unlimited Aid to Yugoslavia; Germany Forced into Three-Front War</h3>
<p>London - According to officials here this morning, the British Empire will provide Yugoslavia with unlimited aid. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that Hitler has launched his offensive again. However, this time, Hitler will find that Greece and Yugoslavia are both prepared, unlike the previous swift and decisive victories. Currently, London officials have no comment on this matter. However, the presence of British Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of the General Staff Dill in Athens indicates that the British government was already aware of Germany's actions and was making arrangements to respond. Facts may prove this later. Germany's decision to invade has greatly expanded the battlefield. Hitler is now forced to take action he has always wanted to avoid: fighting on two fronts. In fact, with the German army now participating in the war in Cyrenaica, it is practically trapped in a three-front war. Public attention is highly focused on the reactions from Ankara and Moscow. The fact that Yugoslavia has just signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union shows that relations between the two countries have become closer. This will further encourage Turkey to adhere to the publicly adopted policy it has followed since the outbreak of the war, namely, providing all possible support to Yugoslavia and Greece. Whether this moral support will translate into material aid remains to be seen. Furthermore, according to a Reuters military correspondent, Britain's decision to provide Yugoslavia with all possible assistance has opened a new and important phase in the world war. Hitler must now fight on at least two fronts, something he desperately wanted to avoid but ultimately failed to do. While Germany may have an advantage over Britain in defending a 2,000-mile coastline through submarine and air warfare, the number of German troops stationed along this line is considerable. The recent air raid on the Lofoten Islands off the northern coast of Norway has made Hitler feel that he may be subjected to even more serious blows at any time. During the last World War, Germany had good rail transport on both its eastern and western fronts. However, in the past twenty years, this transport line has been greatly damaged. The railway in the Balkans has never been in good condition. Therefore, not only is the distance between Germany's eastern and western fronts greater than before, but the transport line is also much worse. Hitler's actions are greatly limited because he has a large territory to garrison. Now, the German army will be fighting in the most difficult terrain, and its opponents are known for their valor. The difficulties of its future can be easily imagined. According to recent news, there are already twelve German divisions in Bulgaria, and another twenty-eight divisions are concentrated along the northern border of Yugoslavia, from the Italian border to east of Belgrade, a total distance of four hundred miles, with a strength of six hundred thousand men. If Yugoslavia were to fight alone, its future would still be bleak, despite the courage of its troops and the rugged terrain. However, Germany cannot focus all its efforts on the south; it must defend against the Greek forces south of Thessaloniki, and it cannot ignore Turkey behind the Maritsa River. Yugoslavia may only use elite troops and covering detachments to defend its borders, while concentrating its main forces in the central area, so that it can take advantage of the terrain to greatly shorten the front line. It is expected that British troops are ready to move quickly and launch a decisive offensive when the time is right. In addition, there is another important factor: if Turkey realizes that German troops are passing through Yugoslavia to the Mediterranean, its future will be seriously threatened. Will it still keep its troops behind the Maritsa River and do nothing? If Turkey actively participates in future battles, the Allied countries will receive the most powerful assistance. In short, the war from now on will be very fierce, with many fronts and various armies participating. The situation is extremely complex, and accurate predictions are truly not easy.

<h3>Soviet Union and Yugoslavia Sign Non-Aggression Treaty; Valid for Five Years; Effective Immediately Upon Exchange of Ratifications</h3>
<p>Moscow - The local radio station broadcast a message stating that the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia has been signed by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Yugoslav Ambassador to the Soviet Union Gavrilović. The content stipulates: (1) The signatory countries shall refrain from any act of aggression or undermining the other party's unity; (2) If one signatory country is at war with a third country, the other signatory country shall adopt a friendly attitude towards that country; (3) The treaty is valid for five years, and will be automatically extended for another five years unless either party requests its termination one year before the expiration date; (4) The treaty shall take effect immediately upon the exchange of ratification documents between the two countries.

<p>Moscow - According to Soviet radio broadcasts, the procedures for the exchange of ratifications of the Soviet-Yugoslav non-aggression treaty will be held as soon as possible in the Yugoslav capital. The signing of this treaty is due to the importance both countries attach to maintaining peace. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London - The British News Agency recently stated that the conclusion of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia is another sign that the Soviet Union will prevent Germany from invading the Balkans. However, whether this treaty is a clear warning that can stop Hitler's actions remains to be seen. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>US Army Holds Grand Parade on Last War Memorial Day; President Roosevelt Addresses Nation on Rebuilding Military and Testing Government System</h3>
<p>New York - The 6th is the memorial day for the United States' participation in the last European war. Because it is a weekday, the grand military parade was held yesterday. Thirty thousand people marched along Fifth Avenue in New York, twenty thousand people marched along Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, and tens of thousands of people marched in other major cities. Government and high-ranking naval and army officials reviewed the parade in Washington, showcasing the latest mobile combat equipment. President Roosevelt's address was broadcast by Secretary of War Stimson, praising the newly enlisted troops and emphasizing that "civilians joining the military is a special achievement of democratic countries," and praising the standing army for training the new army. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>New York - Yesterday, during the celebration of Army Day in the United States, Secretary of War Stimson declared that the men and women of countries that have lost their freedom all regard the United States as "the mainstay of democracy," and that as the military strength of the United States rapidly increases, their hopes are also raised. As the greatest military parade since the armistice of the last war was being held here, Secretary of War Stimson broadcast President Roosevelt's address to the nation from Washington. The US War Memorial Day should have been celebrated today, but it was changed to yesterday. Stimson said, "The peace and order of the whole world has been shaken. The independence of many peace-loving countries has been destroyed. Freedom and democracy have been overthrown. Slave regimes and reactionary systems have been established. When we are committed to establishing an army in the United States that can defend our own freedom, the men and women of all countries who have lost their freedom are focusing their attention on us. They regard us as the mainstay of democracy. Our strength increases, and their hopes also increase." General Marshall, Commander of the United States Army, said that if the United States military receives the full support of the American public, it will never be defeated. The United States is now conducting a major experiment with democracy. Using hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild the military and passing the Lend-Lease Act are all tests of whether our country's government system can cope with the international crisis in a practical way.

<h3>British, American, and Dutch Military Conference to be Held in Philippines Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Washington - The British, American, and Dutch military conference is scheduled to be held in Manila next week. The conference may discuss the use of Singapore by the US Navy. According to reliable sources, the use of American ships on major shipping routes in the Far East may also be on the agenda. It is also reported that the British intend to request the United States to acquire the sixty-nine Axis ships that were seized last week. It is said that British Under-Secretary of Shipping Shalt will submit this request at the Manila conference next week. The Manila conference will have a very important relationship to the future activities of the United States in the Far East and the Near East, especially because the United States has plans to assist China with military equipment, munitions, and aircraft, which must be transported by ship through Burma. Government officials pointed out that if the President allows American ships to enter the Gulf of Aden, then Singapore would be the only base available to the US patrol fleet. (International News Service dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that he did not know the details of the trilateral meeting in Manila next Tuesday between the US, Britain, and the Netherlands, but it would likely be an exchange of information, similar in nature to the meetings in the United States. This remark probably refers to Hull's frequent meetings with the British and Dutch ambassadors and ministers, and his recent meeting with Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens. Hull was unable to say whether the use of joint defense to exchange the use of Far Eastern bases was discussed at last week's bilateral meeting in Manila (the meeting between British Commander-in-Chief in the Far East, Admiral Brooke-Popham, and civil and military officials in Manila). However, when Brooke-Popham passes through Manila next Tuesday on his way back to Singapore from Hong Kong, another meeting will be held. Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens is scheduled to arrive in Manila by plane on Sunday and then proceed to Batavia. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Content of US-Mexico Agreement</h3>
<p>Mexico City - The Mexican government announced last night that the agreement signed by the United States and Mexico in Washington on April 1 this year was approved by the Mexican government the day before yesterday. It stipulates that US military aircraft may land or take off at airports in Mexico City. The contents are as follows: Article 1: US and Mexican aircraft may enjoy this right during the current situation, during the period of armed aggression. Articles 2 to 6 stipulate that when US or Mexican aircraft intend to fly into the other country's territory, they must notify the other party 24 hours before takeoff, and the aircraft must not stay at a foreign airport for more than 24 hours. Each aircraft should carry sufficient fuel to avoid refueling in the other country. Article 7 stipulates that naval and land aircraft will be protected by the military, and the necessary materials and equipment will be supplied through negotiations between the two parties. Article 8: Both parties have the right to revoke the agreement when they believe that "armed aggression" no longer exists, and all aircraft must fly back to their own country within 24 hours. Article 9: This agreement shall take effect immediately upon the exchange of ratification documents. (Haitong dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Arrives in Moscow Today to Continue Talks with Soviet Officials; Scheduled to Stay for Three Days Before Returning Home</h3>
<p>Moscow - Japanese sources here said yesterday that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka will arrive in Moscow on the 7th to continue talks with Soviet officials until the 9th. Matsuoka will make a brief stopover in Moscow on his way to Berlin and Rome. At that time, Stalin personally attended the meeting. This was the first time Stalin had received foreign diplomats at the Kremlin. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Berlin - Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka left here tonight. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop saw him off at the station. Before his departure, he was accompanied by Dr. Ley, leader of the German Labor Front, to visit major factories in Berlin. Afterwards, he held a final meeting with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Speech Before Leaving Berlin</p>
<p>Tokyo - Before leaving Berlin, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka told Japanese reporters that he had gained more than expected from his visit to the Axis countries and his meetings with the leaders of those countries. All issues related to the Tripartite Pact have been clarified, and a new era has now begun. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Goering's newspaper reported yesterday that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka had promised before leaving Berlin that Japan would go to war with any country (including European countries) that attempted to interfere with Japan's foreign policy. The newspaper also stated that "the war in Europe has already begun, and if the United States challenges Japan in Asia, the war will also enter the path to victory." (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>British Newspaper Comments on Japanese-Soviet Relations</p>
<p>London - The Times commented on Matsuoka's tour of Europe, saying that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is truly an ominous bird in the Axis countries, and that the itinerary he chose only allowed him to have a narrow observation of the European situation. Matsuoka is known to be headstrong and disregards unpleasant situations. He went to Germany and Italy at the invitation of Hitler. The main purpose was to show the unity of the European and Asian axes when Germany and Italy began their spring offensive in Europe and Japan launched an offensive in the Pacific to contain Britain and the United States. However, even though Matsuoka is extremely enthusiastic about supporting the Axis, the Japanese government does not fully agree with his views on Japanese-German relations. It is expected that Matsuoka will propose several pro-German advantages when he returns home, but after these advantages are studied, it will be seen that the aid that Hitler can promise is practically zero. If the Soviet-German pact is still reliable, then Hitler can induce the Soviet Union to conclude an agreement with Japan that Matsuoka craves. However, Matsuoka's greatest wish is for the Soviet Union to stop its aid to China. Can the Soviet Union make concessions on this matter? It seems unlikely, because the Soviet Union has great interests in the vast Chinese market and has friendly relations with the patient and enduring Chinese people. The Soviet Union has great visions for this matter, but there are several other points, such as fisheries and commerce, that may be settled through compromise. If the Japanese side is not as insistent as before, then the Soviet Union may allow Matsuoka to achieve a small diplomatic success for the sake of pleasing Hitler. However, this success is not actually very significant. The real key lies in the impression that the developments in Europe and the United States in recent weeks have made on the Japanese government.

<h3>British Troops Capture Addis Ababa; German and Italian Tanks in North African Libyan War Halted by British</h3>
<p>Cairo - The British Middle East Command recently issued a battle report stating that our troops occupied the Abyssinian capital this morning. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London - British Prime Minister Churchill and General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French Forces who is currently inspecting the battlefield in Eritrea, exchanged congratulatory telegrams. De Gaulle telegraphed the British Prime Minister, expressing his admiration for the bravery of the British troops and the unity of the British Empire, and declared the determination of the Free French Forces to fight alongside the British until the final victory. Churchill replied, thanking the Free French Forces for their assistance in the African campaign. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Cairo - Military sources here said last night that according to the latest news from Abyssinia, the Italian army in East Africa is collapsing. It was previously expected that the Italian army would resist between Asmara and Adowa, but Adowa has now surrendered without a fight. When the Italian soldiers retreated, they abandoned their weapons, which is evidence of the disintegration of morale. Now that Adowa has been occupied, British troops can attack Gondar from there. It is thought that the Italian army may not put up significant resistance before British troops reach Addis Ababa, but the fall of the capital does not mean the end of the Abyssinian war, as the Italian army in Gondar still needs to be eliminated. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London - London military circles commented today on the latest news from the Libyan front, saying that it is reassuring that the German and Italian tanks concentrated in Libya have been halted by the British and cannot advance. However, the general public has not viewed this latest news as indicating that the threat from German forces has been lifted. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Khartoum - Although the civil administrator of Massawa, the last Italian port on the Red Sea, received a telephone call from the civil administrator of Asmara, asking him not to resist any further so that the British military authorities could transport food to Asmara to relieve 80,000 civilians, he still refused to surrender. British troops are currently advancing rapidly in order to capture the port. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Cairo - South African troops, moving from Dire Dawa, have crossed the Awash River and are now only ninety miles from the city of Addis Ababa. Although the Italian army has destroyed the roads and railway bridges, the South African troops have occupied the bridgehead of the Awash River. Their vanguard, despite being met with artillery and machine gun fire, continues to advance. The Awash River runs through a rugged valley, and the river is only about seventy yards wide at its widest point, making it a natural fortress. British troops in Eritrea continue to advance from Asmara. Their vanguard has reached south of Adowa. British troops attacked and captured a unit of Italian infantry in that area. The total number of prisoners of war in the Asmara area now reaches five thousand, including four thousand Italians. Railway locomotives, freight cars, and large quantities of military supplies have also been seized. British troops have also made good progress elsewhere. According to a South African Air Force communiqué, the Metahara station east of Addis Ababa was bombed by British aircraft. When the Dire Dawa airport was attacked, twelve enemy aircraft were destroyed, another six were burned, and one was shot down. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Cairo - According to sources in official circles here, the Italian-German forces' advance from Benghazi has been halted, and the situation there is under control. A Middle East British Air Force communiqué stated that enemy forces and transport convoys in western Cyrenaica were heavily bombed by British aircraft. Australian fighters shot down three Messerschmitt 110s and three Junkers 88s, and several others were damaged and are unlikely to return to base. The Australian squadrons suffered no losses. On the night of April 3, four British heavy bombers attacked Tripoli. Flames shot straight up for several miles, and explosions were heard repeatedly. On Friday, enemy aircraft attacked the airfield on Crete, but there were few casualties and little damage. One enemy aircraft was shot down, and no British aircraft were damaged.

<h3>US Four-Engine Aircraft to Bomb German Territory; US Army Officers to Accompany as Observers</h3>

<h3>US Defense Mediation Board Mediates Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>Washington. The U.S. Defense Mediation Board yesterday mediated a strike in the defense industry, thus creating a new crisis on the labor front. Although negotiations between skilled coal miners and manufacturers in the Appalachian coal mining region have reached a compromise, the Industrial Relations Committee in Pittsburgh is still tasked with handling the strike by workers at the U.S. Steel Corporation. The most important task of the mediation board is the all-day discussion held here yesterday between the Industrial Relations Committee and factory representatives, as they seek to have the Milwaukee factory resume operations on Monday. However, news from Milwaukee indicates that the Wisconsin Employees' Association has scheduled a secret ballot on April 10 to decide whether 7,800 workers will continue their strike. The chairman of the Industrial Relations Committee, Murray, also informed the 250,000 workers of U.S. Steel Corporation that a work stoppage would begin at midnight on Tuesday if negotiations for increased wages fail. News from Detroit indicates that the Wisconsin government and federal labor mediators have announced that they hope representatives from Ford and the United Automobile Workers will hold a joint meeting on Monday or Tuesday, and hope that the labor dispute can be resolved through this. In New York, the drafting of the skilled coal miners' contract has begun, which may allow most of the 400,000 workers to resume work on Monday. The contract will be submitted to the Labor-Management Joint Committee for review on Monday. At the same time, some manufacturers in the north, whose representatives represent most of the factories, will also accept the workers' demand for a daily increase of one dollar, including holidays. (United Press, 6th)</p>

The Chinese army killed more than a hundred Japanese soldiers in the suburbs and then stormed into the city, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese army. The Japanese army was showing signs of collapse. In the evening, Chinese army reinforcements continued to pour in. The Japanese army, seeing that the situation was hopeless, retreated southward.

<h3>The Story of the Victory of the Ganbei Troops</h3>
<p>A certain place in northern Hunan. In this campaign in northern Jiangxi, the Chinese army has achieved rare victories. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to a military strategist who participated in the battle to offer congratulations. According to him, the victory in northern Jiangxi lies in the ability to make good use of the "magnet tactics" invented by the Supreme Commander. At the beginning of the Japanese army's three-way westward invasion, it was originally planned to annihilate a certain unit of the Chinese army near Gao'an. However, because the Chinese army changed its deployment as circumstances dictated, it not only allowed the enemy to strike empty-handed first, but also attracted its main force to continue westward. When the Japanese approached Shanggao, the Chinese army used heavy troops to block its advance on one side and ambushes to lie in wait behind it, so that it could neither advance nor escape. It can truly be said that the closer it is drawn, the tighter it becomes. At that time, the Chinese army launched a great counter-encirclement battle in the area of Zaopu, Sixi, and Guanqiao. After several hand-to-hand combats, the Japanese army was finally repelled and the position regained its former appearance. However, due to a slight gap in the encirclement, a small number of Japanese troops slipped through the net. The Chinese side has established an invincible position in the military, which has been further proven by this campaign. (6th)</p>

It is widely believed that this move is aimed at dealing with the new Iraqi ruler, Zhulan. (Haitong News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>London. After the armed coup in Iraq established an anti-British government, Britain has stationed troops at Iraqi oilfields. Responsible parties stated that Britain would never tolerate Iraq becoming a base for Axis countries. Britain has strong control over Iraqi politics and has air force units stationed in Iraq. However, there is currently no situation in which the air force can be used against the new government. Observers believe that the new government is bound to be short-lived.

All political parties in the country have now supported the new government. King Ghazi is still residing in the capital, but the Regent has been placed under surveillance in Basra. General Zaki issued a declaration accusing the Regent of coveting the throne, undermining unity, and attempting to dissolve the army, so the military decided to intervene. Nuri al-Said organized a national defense government in London. Said also issued a declaration stating that he would do his best to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war, abide by international treaties, especially the various treaties signed between the country and Britain, and maintain friendly relations with neighboring Arab countries. Iraqi newspapers gave many favorable comments to the new government and attacked the Regent for being weak and incompetent. In addition, it was also said in political circles in London that Britain had recently made various demands and demanded that Iraq sever diplomatic relations with Italy. All of this was close to interfering in Iraq's internal affairs. (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>

<h3>European War Jottings (43): Inside Wartime Germany</h3>
<p>As far as land is concerned, Berlin's anti-aircraft guns can be said to be the most densely deployed, but in fact they are not of much benefit. Berliners always feel strange, why under hundreds of searchlights, they can't even find a small number of planes in the air. After six months of this experience, they confirmed that Berlin's air raid defense has not been effective at all. Goering assured them that Berlin would never be attacked by air, and they believed this until the first attack. The impact of waking up from the dream was really not small. Berlin is not like London, without the equipment of an aerial balloon array, so if the weather is good, British planes often fly very low in the city.</p>
<p>That being said, Berliners are not limited to living in air raid shelters. The National People's Party, in order to support morale, believes that even in wartime, the daily lives of the people must be mixed with lighthearted elements. Let's talk about theaters. In fact, the prosperity of the seats can be said to exceed any record in peacetime. The tickets for every theater in Berlin were sold out a week in advance. If you want to get a seat in the State Opera House on the main street, you have to reserve it two weeks in advance. Most of the scripts written by playwrights under the control of the National Socialist Party are not worth mentioning. Old theater troupes often use classical dramas by Goethe, Schiller, Molière, Calderón, Ibsen, and Chekhov to attract audiences. But the most popular playwrights are English – Shakespeare and Shaw. When I left Berlin, all of Shaw's plays were being staged. On the eve of the German army's celebration, the play "One Hundred Days" written by the playwright Mussolini was performed in front of the restless audience at the Berlin National Theater. Goering was also present that night, and a few hours later, he jumped out of the theater box and drove to the headquarters of the German Air Force to order a general air force offensive.</p>
<p>At that time, Berlin had at least six musical comedy troupes, and their business was more prosperous than ever before. If this kind of opera is compared with the songs sung by British actors, it is inevitably inferior, falling into a dull and vulgar path, but Berliners have quite an appetite for it. Hitler also has the same hobby. He has visited several times the two operas performed in the capital theater, and was particularly impressed by a Hungarian dancer, and invited her to tea. Hitler has always been fond of Wagner's operas, but since the war broke out, he has been busy with military affairs and has not enjoyed this style for a year and a half since last year. As for various large and small dances, customers can sit inside for a small ticket and a Berlin cup of beer, and enjoy a panoramic view from one-act comedies to Slovak strongman performances, so the business of this kind of place is three times as profitable.</p>
<p>Goering allowed a few reliable comedians to satirize current affairs, mostly jokes about wartime measures regarding food and clothing consumption control. As soon as a word came out, the whole hall was in an uproar. In fact, this is a subtle communication from the authorities, nothing more than to make the people feel that the freedom to criticize the government in public, which Hitler forbade them, that spark of freedom, which is really precious, has now been revived under the iron discipline of dictatorship. Of course, there are many places where satire can offend the authorities. I heard that Berlin's most popular comedian, Willi Schaeffers, was arrested in his own dance hall in Kurfürstendamm for ridiculing "our newly acquainted and respected Soviet friends." Only he dared to do this kind of "walking on thin ice" trick. Jokes about Italy and the uniforms worn by Goering are generally prohibited.</p>
<p>After the theaters are full, Berliners desperately rush to the conservatories. The "Berlin Orchestra" directed by Dr. Furtwängler performed ten times last winter, and all the tickets were sold out in the autumn. Now he has to play each concert twice in a row, but there are still many people who can't get a ticket. Last November and December, the Berlin weekly newspapers published up to twenty-five concerts per week. A third of the advertisements also stated that all tickets were sold out.</p>
<p>Because the British bombers did not come often, and the "night shows" started from 4:30 or 5:00 in the afternoon, Berlin residents could only enjoy their dramas, songs, and solemn music without being disturbed by air raids. In this way, it is very important for maintaining morale. Under this circumstance, everything seems particularly normal. As several Germans told me, everyone's tension about the war has been relaxed a lot.</p>
<p>Although Berlin banned dancing before Christmas, the nightclubs were full every night. In several dance halls in the Kurfürstendamm area, I saw hundreds of young couples, mostly young military officers on vacation from the front line, sitting at tables with their female companions, impatiently following the jazz music, clapping their hands and feet, eager to try. Berlin banned "black jazz" music, and did not allow the performance of light and vulgar tunes, but German shortwave radio stations often stood out, leaking these two banned music from the air, for radio listeners in South Africa and South America to listen to.</p>
<p>Sports can provide a kind of comfort to Germans who are tired from their daily work. Whenever German teams play football with Italy, or vassal German teams from Hungary and Romania, the Olympic Stadium is crowded with 100,000 spectators every Sunday afternoon. When famous heavyweight boxers like Walter Neusel compete with others, at least 100,000 spectators go to the Berlin Sports Hall to cheer them on. Recently, someone proposed to invite Schmeling to hold a grand boxing match in Berlin, but unfortunately he was injured in a parachute landing exercise in the army, and the proposal was abandoned.</p>
<p>Golf also continues to exist in Berlin. At one time, the government banned people from driving cars to save gasoline, and Berlin citizens could not go to the Wannsee golf course in the suburbs, so golf stopped. Later, German sports stars Zitzemow and Austen appealed, and the government specially approved the supply of gasoline for two cars to transport the players from the Wannsee elevated station to the golf course three miles away for competition.</p>
<p>During each horse racing season, the city is empty, just like in peacetime, and I have recently noticed that the newspapers also use large headlines to report the winners of the major horse racing championships, and publish them on the opposite page of the war news.</p>
<p>German morale is still very sound, but to be honest, the civilians are exhausted and yearn for peace. What is strange is that the Germans don't hate the British that much. For a year and a half, I often went to restaurants, cafes, and often took trains, subways, buses, trams, and planes. Being forbidden to speak English only happened once. At that time, Paris had just fallen, and I was talking to several German soldiers in English in a restaurant in Paris, and was stopped by German secret police. Regardless of the German air force actually fighting on the front line, they all admired the courage and skill of the British air force in combat. German air force personnel especially appreciated the "Spitfire" aircraft, followed by the "Hurricane" and "Challenge" models. As far as the Germans I know are concerned, most of them praised the British air force fighters for flying long distances to bomb Germany as very heroic. The Germans always had some ridicule in their words towards their ally Italy. This attitude is not only the same among the German people, but also among the National Socialist leaders who promoted the German-Italian alliance. When the Italian army gradually became unable to support the war with Greece, the following dialogue was very popular. Someone asked, "What exactly are Italy's secret weapons?" The correct answer is: "The German army."</p>
<p>Of course, the Germans have no ill feelings towards the Americans, but everyone feels that American aid to Britain is becoming more concrete, and even preparing to get involved in the whirlpool. German newspapers rarely report on American aid to Britain, so the people don't know the details. German newspapers spare no effort in criticizing President Roosevelt's speeches, but in fact, readers have never seen the original text of Roosevelt's speeches and don't know what the newspapers are attacking him for. In the past two or three months, the British attitude towards the war has gradually made the Germans feel uneasy. If the United States joins the war, it will be a great blow to German morale. The general German thinking on this matter is very simple. What they think is, "During the last European war, the United States joined the war when we were still winning, and as a result we lost. Now the United States is going to join the war when we are winning, maybe we will lose a second time."</p>
<p>The National Socialist leaders and the highest military authorities have long recognized that the United States has already joined the war, the only difference is a name. Therefore, the German side is trying its best to achieve final victory within the year, or within six months. The German side knows more about the situation in the United States than the Americans themselves, and the accuracy and reliability of the secret information they obtain from the United States is surprising. They know that the United States is just starting in military terms, and that everything is not ready for both troops and airplanes. Regardless of whether Hitler predicts that the United States will join the war in the spring, summer, or autumn, he will start first and strike first.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Structure of the Municipal Council: The Ratepayers' Meeting is Expected to Pass; The Japanese Believe It is Only a Temporary Measure; The Agenda of the General Meeting Was Announced by the Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>The reorganization of the Municipal Council's board of directors is still under close observation by all parties yesterday. Although the negotiations between the consuls-general of the three countries did not proceed due to the holiday, the formal proposal drafted by the public is expected to be signed by the three consuls-general and submitted to the Consular Body and the General Office of the Municipal Council within the next week. According to observations by well-informed sources yesterday, this proposal will be based on the talks previously published by Fessenden. In addition to stating the "existing difficulties" in the administration of the Municipal Council, it will formally propose a change in the number of directors. Its publication date should be on the eve of the Ratepayers' Special Meeting, and on the day of the decision, it will be submitted to the Special Meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>Passage by the General Meeting is Almost Certain</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether the Ratepayers' Special Meeting will pass the Municipal Council's reorganization plan, the reporter consulted various related parties yesterday. According to them, based on experience, few proposals submitted to the Ratepayers' Special Meeting (or Annual Meeting) fail to pass. This is because a number of "bigwigs" who can manipulate the number of votes of the ratepayers are in fact either involved in the Municipal Council or have close ties with the Municipal Council. Of course, before the Ratepayers' Special Meeting is held, backstage contacts between various parties will be extremely tense, and there is no doubt that preparations will be sufficient. Therefore, the passage of this proposal to change the number of directors is expected. However, the approval of the Consular Body and the consent of the Chinese government will be slightly more difficult.</p>
<p>The Japanese Claim It is Not a Fundamental Solution</p>
<p>The Times reported, according to the Allied News Agency, that the Japanese Consulate General announced last night (the 5th) that the consular representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan in this city have reached an agreement on the plan to change the number of directors of the Municipal Council, and have temporarily amended the structure of the Municipal Council. The plan stipulates that there will be three British, American, and Japanese directors each, four Chinese directors, one German director, and one director from other neutral countries. It will be submitted to the Special Meeting of Ratepayers for discussion on April 16. It is said that this amendment plan will also be submitted to the Consular Body for approval. The above notice also solemnly stated that this plan is only a "temporary measure" and does not mean that the administrative problems of the Municipal Council have been fundamentally resolved.</p>
<p>The Full Text of the Agenda Was Published Yesterday</p>
<p>The date of the Ratepayers' Meeting is April 17, at 2:30 p.m., and the location is the Public Grandstand of the Race Club on Jing'an Temple Road. In addition to discussing the organization and powers of the board of directors, the motions of the General Meeting published by the Municipal Council were obtained yesterday as follows: "Motion 1: Elect the Chairman of the Meeting (according to Article 15 of the Land Regulations, the Chief Consul attending the meeting may be the Chairman of the Meeting). Motion 2: Elect the Secretary of the Meeting. Motion 3: The new articles and amendments to the annexes of the Land Regulations, as stated in the Municipal Council Gazette on March 31, are requested to be approved. The order of the articles shall be in accordance with the Gazette, but the new annex 52, Section 4 shall be deleted, and the new annex 52, Section 3 shall be amended as follows: "If the Municipal Council Board decides that it is final and legally binding, it may implement the decision and collect taxes in accordance with Articles 10 or 12 of the Land Regulations." If the ratepayers have any questions about Motion 3, they must notify the General Office of the Municipal Council in writing 24 hours before the meeting."</p>
<p>All Parties Are Concerned About the Future of the Concession</p>
<p>At present, all sectors of the city are paying close attention to the status of Shanghai during the Pacific War, fearing that once it is seized by the Japanese, all guarantees will be lost. However, according to observers, if there is a Japanese-American war, Japan will not seize the concession. The actual reasons are: (1) Shanghai is the last area for Japan to collect foreign exchange; (2) Shanghai is not only in the interests of the United Kingdom and the United States, and it is easy to cause extensive international disputes. But in any case, although the concession will not be seized, Japan and its forces will expand abnormally within the concession. The administrative structure of the Municipal Council may be difficult to maintain. Fessenden's announced "recommendation" is that non-British and American ratepayers will have the power to decide everything in the concession. Therefore, if the current authorities do not take precautions against small evils, the future development is difficult to imagine. The change in the number of directors of the Municipal Council is only the first step.</p>
<h3>National Goods Visa</h3>
<p>Sponsored by Three National Goods Organizations</p>
<p>According to news from the national goods industry in the city yesterday, the China Manufacturers Association, the China National Goods Service Agency, and the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce have jointly organized a committee to handle national goods visa matters in order to facilitate the registration of national goods manufacturers' products with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Preparations are currently underway and are nearing completion. Once formally decided, it can be established. The number of committee members is set at nine, with each organization sending three members as its members. It can be realized within one or two weeks. As for the purpose of forming the association, it is to facilitate the registration of all national goods industrial products with the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All national goods industrial products from Shanghai or Hong Kong will be certified by the committee members after they are deemed to be national goods, so that the manufacturers can apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for registration, so that they can be recognized as formal national goods and be given convenience or preferential treatment in accordance with the national goods import and export regulations. It is understood that the affairs of the association are limited to the above scope. If national goods are to be shipped overseas and the association needs to issue a certificate, but the time is urgent and the association cannot issue a certificate, the national goods organizations can still issue certificates separately. It is also understood that the association's address will be established in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Advance Salary Approved</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, in order to urgently seek to alleviate the suffering of its members, met with the Postal Workers' Union on the first day of this month to request Director Guo, Deputy Director Xu, and Section Chief Yu of the Chongqing Postal Administration to approve an additional 100 yuan per month for each person to provide relief and living subsidies. Wu then requested that Director Lin be ordered within two days to allow each person to advance 100 yuan immediately to alleviate the urgent need. It is now learned that the Postal Administration has replied to the union by telegram yesterday, approving an advance of 100 yuan per person from [date missing], but it must be deducted when salaries are paid at the end of the month. The matter of increasing salaries and allowances is still under consideration before a decision is made. It is understood that the Postal Workers' Union has notified all members separately.</p>
<h3>The Number of Frozen Corpses on the Streets Increased Sharply Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in this city was affected by high pressure. Hail fell the day before yesterday. Although the weather was sunny yesterday, it was extremely cold, like mid-winter. As a result, the number of frozen corpses on the streets increased sharply. Yesterday alone, the Pushan Villa collected about seven large and small corpses. According to the Astronomical Observatory, this kind of cold weather will pass soon, and the weather will warm up.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Free French Declare Continued Struggle: Determined Not to Yield to Threats and Intimidation; The Arrest of Agout Caused Anger from All Sides</h3>
<p>According to the "China Press," Agout, the leader of the Free French, who was arrested by the French naval authorities yesterday, is still detained on the Jonque cannonboat. The person in charge of the Free French movement in Shanghai broadcast a statement on the XODN radio station in the city last night regarding Agout's detention, saying that Agout's residence is property owned by Belgians, and Agout is now imprisoned on a French cannonboat. It is rumored that he will be sent to Saigon to be tried by a military court on the charge of inducing the French navy to join the Free French army.</p>
<p>Continue Activities and Are Determined Not to Surrender</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Free French received a notice ordering the temporary suspension of radio broadcasts, and the weekly newspaper published once a week was also temporarily suspended. The Shanghai Free French have stated in advance that they will never yield to intimidation or threats. They will continue their activities, but the difference is that in the past, they had a spirit of reconciliation towards the people of the Vichy faction, but in the future, they will be forced to take a tough attitude. They have always made concessions to those who support Vichy in order to avoid a split among the French community in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the French authorities here used this point to take hostile actions against the French community involved in the Tagore movement in this city.</p>
<p>Patriots Were Indicted as Criminals</p>
<p>The order to oppose the Tagore movement, on the surface, came from Vichy, but in reality, it may have been issued from Berlin. French people are fighting for their country, but they are indicted as criminals. Therefore, in the future, the Free French in Shanghai will no longer have any concerns about the Vichy people in this city. The news of Agout's arrest has caused anger and contempt among all foreigners in Shanghai. This afternoon, the Tagore Association office in the city received many souvenirs expressing sympathy. The souvenirs were donated by people from various countries, which shows that in Shanghai, the words "freedom," "patriotism," and "courage" have not lost their meaning.</p>
<h3>More Mines Found in South China Sea</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Port Affairs Section previously notified all ships that floating mines had been found in the waters near the Middle Continent of Hong Kong, according to a notice from the Hong Kong Port Director. Now, they have continued to be found in the waters of Luke Cheu George Island. Yesterday, a sea warning bulletin was issued, ordering ships traveling on the South China Sea route to pay close attention.</p>
<h3>More Than a Hundred American Nationals to Withdraw Tomorrow;</h3>
<p>The Coolidge Arrives in Shanghai Today.</p>
<p>The American Mail Steamship Company's "President Coolidge", under the command of Captain Weaver, returned to Shanghai last night at 8:00 PM from Manila, Hong Kong, and berthed at mooring buoys 12 and 13. The ship will remain in Shanghai until 9:00 AM on the 8th before setting sail, via Kobe in Japan, Los Angeles, Honolulu, and San Francisco to New York. The Jianghai passenger steamer will depart from the Customs Wharf at 7:30 AM on that day, carrying passengers to transfer to the large ship. About one hundred and ten American nationals residing in Shanghai will board the ship to return to their home country on that day. According to the American Consulate, there are currently 1,900 Americans residing in Shanghai registered with the consulate, and 500 American nationals from the Philippines. About 110 people are deciding to leave on this ship. When the President Coolidge returns to Manila from the United States, a large number of American nationals will also leave on the ship. The "Coolidge" is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 10:30 AM today from the United States, and the ship is expected to berth at mooring buoys 11 and 12. The Customs passenger steamer is scheduled to arrive at the Customs Wharf at 11:30 AM to pick up passengers. The ship is carrying a large amount of American mail to China and will stay in Shanghai overnight, departing for Hong Kong and Manila at 9:00 AM on Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Strict Searches in the Two Concessions Lead to Sharp Decrease in Theft Cases</h3>
<p>Since the police authorities in the two concessions adopted strict security measures last week, Chinese and foreign police officers have been conducting searches day and night. The French Concession is especially strict and has not relaxed at all. The security situation has improved significantly. According to a reporter from the Universal News Agency, who inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, the number of various criminal cases that occurred in the past week ending on the 5th has decreased compared to the previous week, totaling 358 cases, a decrease of five cases compared to the 363 cases in the previous week. However, it is worth noting that none of the crimes that occurred were large-scale. Statistics show that there were 184 theft cases, while armed robbery cases have decreased sharply, with only 12 cases, a decrease of 16 cases compared to the previous week. The number of criminals arrested was 599, an increase of 193 compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3>Desperate Pleas for Relief from Taizhou</h3>
<p>The Taizhou Disaster Relief Association has recently received telegrams from various counties in Taizhou pleading for relief. The details are as follows: (1) The Wenling County Government telegraphed that more than 180,000 mu of farmland in the county were affected by the disaster, and more than 200,000 famine-stricken people are awaiting relief, with a shortage of more than 140,000 shi of food. (2) The Linhai Food Relief Association telegraphed that the relief fund of 10,000 yuan has been received. The famine in this county is severe, and starving people are everywhere. It is still hoped that funds will continue to be received. (3) The Sanmen Food Relief Association telegraphed that starving people are crying out for food and requested an appropriation of 20,000 yuan for relief. (4) The Tiantai County Relief Association telegraphed that the disaster situation last year was severe, and at this time of year when crops are not yet ripe, many families are running out of food. Please allocate relief funds continuously. The association, in response to the telegrams from various counties pleading for relief, has immediately convened a meeting to discuss actively promoting fundraising efforts. It has also decided to hold a charity sale of calligraphy and paintings and has already received more than 1,000 pieces of calligraphy and paintings donated by famous artists. It will soon select a location for a public exhibition and use all the proceeds from the sale for relief.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Internal Migration of Mobile Capital; Shanghai Remittance to Chongqing Rises to Over 1,100 Yuan</h3>
<p>Shanghai is flooded with mobile capital, and investment channels are becoming increasingly narrow, leading to rampant speculation and soaring prices, which has a significant impact on people's livelihood. After the Southwest Industrial Association petitioned the government to encourage the internal migration of mobile capital from Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance agreed to guarantee the safety of the interest on capital transferred internally and ordered all banks to waive remittance fees for funds remitted to the interior, providing various conveniences. A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that since 1941, due to the emergency of the Pacific situation, the remittance of mobile capital from Shanghai to the interior has increased daily. The funds are invested in various newly established national industries in the interior and deposited in various banks, including the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Agricultural Bank, as well as the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Juxingcheng Bank, and the Postal Savings Bureau. All of them have transferred huge amounts of funds to Chongqing, resulting in abundant sources of Shanghai remittances. On the contrary, the destinations for Shanghai remittances have decreased, so that the Shanghai-Chongqing exchange rate has gradually fallen. The exchange rate for funds remitted from Chongqing to Shanghai has dropped to 1,150 yuan in legal tender and 1,145 yuan for remittances. The supply of Shanghai remittance positions in the Chongqing market exceeds demand. This is indeed a good phenomenon in the midst of the internal migration of funds.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Rewards Diligent Detectives and Constables</h3>
<p>Chinese Detective No. 329 of Gordon Road in the Public Concession died on December 25 last year while capturing a thief on Connaught Road. In addition, Chinese Constable No. 357 bravely and alertly captured a thief on Alabaster Road on January 27 this year. The Municipal Council Police Department has approved the granting of a first-class medal to each of them through the awards committee. In addition, Chinese Inspector No. 108, Chinese Detective No. 307, and Chinese Constable No. 1880 have each been awarded a second-class medal for their meritorious service in capturing thieves, in order to encourage and inspire them.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Rate Case: Possibly Temporarily Shelved</h3>
<p>The sensational case of the four Chinese landowners suing the Public Works Bureau over the rating is expected to conclude after this trial. The three Consuls-General of Great Britain, the United States, and Japan will then jointly hear the case. Both parties' pleadings were submitted two weeks ago, but there is no definite news on when the court hearing will commence. It is said that the plaintiff's main argument is based on the Land Regulations. However, due to the impending changes in the proportion of directors in the current Board, there are rumors of amendments to the Land Regulations. If this news is accurate, the case will resolve itself after the Land Regulations are amended. Before the issue of amending the Land Regulations is decided, the rate case may be temporarily shelved.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Saves Electricity: Three Elevators Suspended</h3>
<p>To conserve electricity, the Public Works Bureau has restricted the use of elevators within its premises. In the Public Works Bureau building, there are a total of four elevators, one along Hankou Road, one along [Whitespace], and one along Fuzhou Road. Three of these four elevators have been suspended, with only the one on Fuzhou Road remaining open, but even this is restricted to travel between the second and fourth floors. It does not descend to the ground floor, nor does it stop on the third floor.</p>
<h3>French Concession Issues: White Russian Registration Certificates</h3>
<p>Deadline: Within One Month</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, White Russian immigrants residing within the French Concession, who are 18 years of age or older, must register their address, age, and occupation with the French Police Station on Rue Chapsal (presently known as Middle Fuxing Road) within one month. A registration fee will be collected, and the police station will issue a certificate resembling a passport. Those who fail to register within the deadline will be fined one to one hundred yuan. Those who harbor malicious intentions or falsely report their address or occupation will be fined one thousand yuan if discovered. If a registered person relocates, the French Police Station must be notified within fifteen days.</p>
<h3>Similarities Between Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism (Part Two): Jia Jiying's Speech at Rongwu Society</h3>
<p>The Idea of Great Harmony</p>
<p>"Confucianism": In the "Book of Rites - The Great Learning," Confucius said, "When the Great Way prevails, all under heaven belongs to all. The virtuous and capable are selected. Sincerity is emphasized and harmony cultivated. People do not care only for their own parents, nor do they cherish only their own children. The elderly are provided for until their end, the strong are employed, the young are nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, the disabled, and the sick are all cared for. Men have their roles, and women have their homes. People detest the waste of goods on the ground, but do not necessarily store them for themselves; they deplore that their strength is not used, but not necessarily for their own benefit. Thus, schemes are suppressed and do not arise, and theft, disorder, and rebellion do not occur, so the outer doors are not closed. This is called the Great Harmony." "Buddhism": The "Amitabha Sutra" states, "Why is that land called 'Ultimate Bliss'? Because the beings in that land have no suffering, but only experience joy. Therefore, it is called 'Ultimate Bliss.' In that Buddha-land, there are no three evil paths. In that Buddha-land, there is not even the name of evil paths, let alone the reality. The Land of Ultimate Bliss is adorned with such merits." "Taoism": The "Tao Te Ching" says, "In the extreme of good governance, neighboring countries look upon each other; the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard. The people are content with their food, pleased with their clothing, secure in their dwellings, and happy with their customs. Until old age and death, they do not visit each other." The "Zhuangzi - Rifling Coffers" says, "Do you alone not know the age of Perfect Virtue? In ancient times, there were Rong Cheng, Da Ting, Bo Huang, Zhong Yang, Li Lu, Li Xu, Xuan Yuan, He Xu, Zun Lu, Zhu Rong, Fu Xi, and Shen Nong. In those times, the people tied knots to keep records. They were content with their food, pleased with their clothing, happy with their customs, and secure in their dwellings. Neighboring countries looked upon each other; the sounds of chickens and dogs were heard. Until old age and death, the people did not visit each other. In such a time, there was perfect governance."</p>
<p>The Idea of Responsibility</p>
<p>"Confucianism": In the "Analects," Confucius said, "If someone would employ me, in a month it would be enough; in three years, there would be accomplishment." In the "Analects - Morning Gate," it is said, "Is it not he who knows that it cannot be done, yet does it?" And also, "How earnest he is, striking the sounding stone!" In the "Analects - Yi Fengren," it is said, "Why should you be concerned about losing your position? The world has long been without the Way! Heaven will use the Master as a wooden-tongued bell." In the "Analects," Confucius said, "One cannot associate with birds and beasts. If I do not associate with these people, with whom shall I associate? When the Way prevails under Heaven, Qiu will not change things." Mencius said, "Heaven does not yet wish to bring peace and order to the world. If Heaven wishes to bring peace and order to the world, who in the present age is better than I?" And also, "Do I love to argue? I cannot help it." "Buddhism": The "Diamond Sutra" says, "All kinds of beings, whether born from eggs, wombs, moisture, or transformation; whether with form or without form; whether with thought or without thought; whether neither with thought nor without thought, I cause them all to enter Nirvana without remainder and deliver them." The "Records of Extraordinary Events of Guanshiyin" states, "Guanyin Bodhisattva had already become the Righteous Dharma Bright Tathagata in the past. He came against the current, manifesting the Bodhisattva form, making a great vow that he would not attain Buddhahood until he had delivered all sentient beings." "Taoism": The "Zhuangzi - The Great and Venerable Teacher" says, "Suppose that it transforms my left arm into a rooster, I would use it to crow at night. Suppose that it transforms my right arm into a crossbow pellet, I would use it to shoot down an owl for roasting. Suppose that it transforms my buttocks into wheels, with my spirit as a horse, I would ride it. Why would I need another carriage?"</p>
<p>The Idea of Life and Death</p>
<p>"Confucianism": In the "Analects," Confucius said, "Life and death are decreed." And also, "A man of determination and virtue does not seek to live at the expense of virtue, but sacrifices his life to achieve virtue." And also, "From ancient times, death has existed, but a people without faith cannot stand." Mencius said, "Life is what I desire, and righteousness is what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up life and take righteousness." "Buddhism": The "Amitabha Sutra" says, "If there be a good man or a good woman who hears of Amitabha Buddha and firmly grasps His name... with one mind undisturbed... when that person is about to die... with mind not confused, he shall be born in the Land of Ultimate Bliss of Amitabha Buddha." "Taoism": The "Zhuangzi - Discussion on Making All Things Equal" says, "How do I know that delight in life is not delusion? How do I know that abhorring death is not like having lost one's home and not knowing where to return? How do I know that those who die do not regret their former seeking for life?" And also, "None live longer than a child who dies young, yet Peng Zu died prematurely. Heaven and earth were born together with me, and all things are one with me." And also, the "Nourishing Life Principle" says, "When the master came, it was timely; when he left, it was in accordance with nature. To be at peace with time and abide by nature, sorrow and joy cannot enter him. The ancients called this the loosening of the bond of God." And also, "The guiding principle is used up like kindling. The fire is passed on, but no one knows its limit." And also, the "Great and Venerable Teacher" says, "The Great Clod (Earth) carries me with a form, burdens me with life, eases me with old age, and gives me rest with death. Therefore, he who cherishes my life also cherishes my death." And also, "He regards life as a superfluous growth, and death as the bursting of a tumor. How could he know where life and death lie, before or after?"</p>
<p>The Idea of Acting with Integrity in Seclusion</p>
<p>"Confucianism": A gentleman is calm and open, while a petty person is always anxious. In the "Book of Rites - The Great Learning," it says, "When the petty man is dwelling alone, he does all kinds of evil. When he sees a gentleman, he is ashamed and conceals his evil, pretending to be good. But how can this benefit him when others see him as they see his lungs and liver? This is called being sincere within and manifesting it without. Therefore, the gentleman must be cautious when alone." Zengzi said, "What ten eyes see and ten hands point at is awe-inspiring! Wealth adorns the house, virtue adorns the person. When the mind is broad, the body is at ease. Therefore, the gentleman must make his intentions sincere." And also, the "Doctrine of the Mean" says, "The Way cannot be separated from for even a moment. What can be separated is not the Way. Therefore, the gentleman is cautious about what he does not see and fearful of what he does not hear. Nothing is more visible than what is hidden, and nothing is more manifest than what is minute. Therefore, the gentleman is cautious when alone." "Buddhism": The "Heart Sutra" says, "Bodhisattvas, relying on Prajna Paramita, have no hindrance in their minds. Because there is no hindrance, there is no fear. They are far removed from deluded dreams and ultimately attain Nirvana. The Buddhas of the three worlds, relying on Prajna Paramita, attain Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi." Lao Zhuang represents the academic trend of thought in southern China, while Confucius and Mencius represent the academic trend of thought in northern China. Zigong was a student of Confucius from the south, hence he did not emphasize making writings. Zixia was a student of Confucius from the north, hence he wrote a great deal. This is similar to the southern sudden enlightenment and northern gradual enlightenment of the Tiantai School of Buddhism. (The End)</p>

<h3>Japan's Financial Straits: New Bonds to Be Issued Again, Consumption to Be Reduced to an Unprecedented Low</h3>
<p>A renowned economic expert, Aris, commented in the English-language "Great American Weekly" yesterday that Japan has entered another new fiscal year on April 1st. This year marks the fifth year of the Sino-Japanese War and the third year of the so-called "New Order." Although Japan's finances have not yet reached the point of total exhaustion, its current financial straits are beyond doubt.</p>
<p>People Face: Unprecedented Burden</p>
<p>The meaning, purpose, and success of Tokyo's "New Order" policy are still unknown. However, one thing is certain: this policy will cause the Japanese people to face an unprecedented economic burden. The Tokyo government's regular income is even unable to cover 40% of its expenses. Therefore, the remaining 60% must be obtained by issuing new bonds.</p>
<p>Dare Not Ask: About the Budget</p>
<p>The Japanese Diet has just completed its three-month budget, but this budget is nothing more than a formality to deceive the people. The military and extremists are rampant, and no one dares to make serious criticisms of the budget. As for the army and navy budgets, and especially the budget for the war in China, no one dares to question them.</p>
<p>Motivating Savings: Ordering the Purchase of Bonds</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Tokyo government has no choice but to launch another savings campaign and place unprecedented pressure on businesses and people to reserve more money, directly or indirectly, for the purchase of bonds. The Japanese people will have to reduce their current consumption to an unprecedented low. This development is, of course, contrary to national prosperity.</p>
<h3>Slaughterhouse Workers in the French Concession Strike Again</h3>
<p>Protracted Labor Dispute at Transportation Companies</p>
<p>At the slaughterhouse company on Route Tenant de Mille (presently known as Middle Xizang Road) in the French Concession, a local gang leader Chen Jinhai, had a dispute with the slaughterhouse workers over the distribution of pig bristles. This resulted in him being attacked and injured by the workers. Two workers were arrested. As a result, all of the company's workers suddenly declared a strike on the 4th of this month. The workers temporarily resumed work the night before, so fresh meat was sold in the French Concession yesterday. However, the workers went on strike again yesterday. The fresh meat industry held an emergency meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday to discuss solutions. However, a resolution could only be reached after negotiations with the slaughterhouse, so no results were achieved at that time. According to the fresh meat industry yesterday, there may still be some old stock available in the French Concession tomorrow (the 7th), but the day after tomorrow (the 8th), except for a few meat shops that can purchase from the International Settlement, the rest may be forced to close. Therefore, residents of the French Concession will have a feeling of "no meat to eat."</p>
<p>Transportation Automobiles</p>
<p>All drivers from the four transportation automobile companies in the city, including Youning, Ningbo, Yong'an, and Shangtian, jointly requested a wage increase due to rising prices and the difficulty of maintaining a livelihood. Because the employers refused, a deadlock was formed. Later, the Labor Federation took the initiative to mediate and invited labor and management to hold negotiations on the 1st and 5th of this month. Unexpectedly, the employers did not attend either negotiation, resulting in failure. The labor side was very dissatisfied and declared a strike at 9:00 AM yesterday. It is heard that other companies, such as China and Maotai, may also be affected due to allied agreements.</p>
<p>Western Clothes</p>
<p>After mediation, the strike in the Western clothing industry, along Sichuan Road and Hubei Road, was successfully mediated by personnel from the Political Department of the Public Works Bureau of the International Settlement on the 3rd of this month. All formally resumed work on the 4th. The Western clothing industry on Avenue Joffre (presently known as Middle Huaihai Road) has also successfully concluded negotiations between labor and management and resumed work yesterday morning. All conditions are the same as those on Sichuan Road and other locations.</p>
<p>Shoe Industry</p>
<p>After the shoe-making workers went on strike, they proposed to the employers to increase wages by 30%. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, because rice prices have fallen recently, they are only willing to agree to increase wages by 20%. The labor side was not satisfied, so the two sides are still at a standstill. However, some shoe stores have agreed to increase wages by 30%, so they have resumed business and are subsidizing the workers who have returned to work.</p>
<p>Scale Shop</p>
<p>Most of the scale shops (i.e. weighing shops) have agreed to increase wages appropriately, so more than 20 shops have resumed business. There are still more than 10 scale shops where the employers have also agreed to respond to the proposal today to appropriately increase wages, so the workers resumed work yesterday morning first.</p>
<h3>Civilian Ward at Saint Marie Hospital</h3>
<p>Saint Marie Hospital is the largest hospital in the French Concession, with a long history and comprehensive equipment. Over the years, injured citizens from various unfortunate incidents in the French Concession, regardless of the severity of the injuries, have been sent to the hospital by the police for treatment. The hospital's civilian ward has low fees. Before the war, it was only 30 cents of national currency per person per day, including all hospitalization and medical expenses. Recently, due to the rising cost of living, it has increased to one yuan per person per day, still including all medical expenses. The hospital's newly built civilian ward has been completed. The ward is a four-story reinforced concrete building with heating and the latest sanitary equipment. The top floor is the children's ward, and the air and sunlight are very suitable for sanatorium conditions. The other floors are men's and women's wards for various departments. The second floor also has a large, beautifully designed operating room. The operating room has excellent lighting equipment as well as heating and air conditioning. It is said that the operating room is specially designed for civilians and is a blessing for the poor people of Shanghai. (Photographed by Wang Shourong)</p>
<h3>Conductor on Route 1 Tram Hits Passenger</h3>
<p>At 9:30 last night, when a Route 1 tram was passing the Carter Road (presently known as Nanjing West Road) station, three passengers were attempting to board. The tram was already very crowded. The conductor, number 258, immediately closed the tram door. Because the three passengers had been waiting for a long time, they did not want to let go. The conductor then used the tram key to strike the passenger's face, immediately causing blood to flow and the passenger to fall to the ground. Later, a companion escorted the passenger onto the tram to the Jing'an Temple. After ticket inspector number 12[Whitespace] failed to mediate, Chinese constable number 2820 took the conductor and passenger to the police station for processing.</p>
<h3>Stealing Medicines: Three Offenders Punished Separately</h3>
<p>A large quantity of valuable medicines, worth over 6,000 yuan, was stolen from the warehouse of the Wanguo Pharmacy at Lane 328 on Fuzhou Road. After reporting to the Central Police Station, Chinese detective Wu Yaozu investigated and found that the theft was committed by Shao Guohua, an employee of the warehouse. He was arrested and confessed that he had sold a large portion of the stolen goods to the Yonghua Pharmacy at 512 Tianjin Road at less than half the market price. The detectives suspected that the pharmacy was knowingly receiving stolen goods, so they arrested its manager Zhang Xiaocai (also known as Ni Xiaocai) and accountant Chen Shaoting. Luo Zhimin and Qin Songtao were at large. They were escorted to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted according to the law, stating that the Yonghua Pharmacy specialized in receiving stolen goods and had advertised to buy Western medicines. Therefore, he requested that the captured offenders be severely punished and that arrest warrants be issued for Luo and Qin. Chen Shaoting hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. After questioning by Judge Fang, Shao Guohua was sentenced to six months in prison, Zhang Xiaocai was sentenced to three months in prison, and Chen Shaoting was fined 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Baoxing Lane Bloodshed: Culprit Arrested; French Concession Police Arrested Large Number of Bandits; Many Cases Being Investigated</h3>
<p>The She Wen News Agency reports that at 8:30 the night before last, the French police arrested eight local people, including Huang Ming, in room 37 of the Aidoo Hotel on Ningxing Street and seized a pistol from Huang. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, it is now known that the police sent detectives to wait there that night, resulting in the arrest of 25 people. Among them were Zhai Songming (Anhui, 37 years old) and Hu Zhengming (Huzhou, 28 years old), members of the "Chongming Peace Association," who came to Shanghai to recruit "Peace Army" members. Yesterday morning, the police continued to arrest two more criminals at the hotel. It is now learned that the assassination of Zhou Baoda and two others at the entrance of No. 25 Baoxing Lane was also committed by these people.</p>
<p>April 4</p>

<p>Grey Women's Robe</p>
<p>One piece, a fox-lined men's overcoat. They were escorted back to the police station for interrogation. After questioning, the defendants confessed that on March 14th, they conspired to rob a certain family at No. 30 Yong'an Villa, Avenue Haig (presently known as Middle Huashan Road), of 5,000 yuan. At the same time, the case of the robbery of more than 400 yuan at a money shop on Route de Notre Dame des Champs (presently known as South Shanxi Road) was also committed by the defendants. Yang's wife, Ms. Yu, was responsible for transporting firearms for the gang of thieves. The police are still investigating and arresting other accomplices because the defendants have committed numerous crimes.</p>
<h3>Oppressed by Life: Old Man Hangs Himself</h3>
<p>An old man from Suzhou, Zhuang Menglou (62 years old), recently came to Shanghai from his hometown and stayed with his relatives at No. 72, Metcalfe Road (presently known as East Beijing Road). Zhuang felt oppressed by the environment at around 9:00 AM yesterday and was suddenly despondent. He hung himself with a rope. When his relatives discovered it, they rushed him to the hospital for treatment, but it was too late. He died halfway to the hospital.</p>
<h3>Hiring a Taxi to Transport Opium: Intercepted by Detectives: Four Women Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Shen Dehui, a Chinese detective at the Old Gate Police Station, found two Yitai rental cars at the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Xiamen Road yesterday. He seized 69 taels of opium in the car and arrested 10 men and women, including Ms. Chen Gu, a woman from Shaoxing. They were escorted to the First Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted according to the anti-smoking law. After questioning by Judge Xiao, Chen Gu, Chen Ni, Chen Huang, and Chen Wang were each sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. The remaining Xu Zhang, Zhang Qian, Qian Chen, Chen Wang, Chen Baixiang, and Wu Zhigang were all found not guilty. The opium and other items were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Returning Home After a Late-Night Mahjong Game: Falling into a Ditch and Dying</h3>
<p>Road Worker Commits Crime of Negligence</p>
<p>Hang Guangting (59 years old), a worker from Jiangbei, residing at No. 149, Zhoujiapai Road, was a worker at the Electric Power Company. At around 7:00 PM on the 31st of last month, he carried 5 yuan in national currency and went to the home of his friend surnamed Kong at No. 31, Lane 201 on the same road to play mahjong. At 11:00 PM, he returned home. The Wen Deli lane was dug by Zhao Jiang, a Cantonese plumber from the Water Supply Company, and three workers dug a trench 5.5 feet deep, 2 feet wide, and 16 feet long opposite the back door of Kong's house for [Whitespace] water pipes. It had not yet been completed. The trench was filled with more than one foot of [Whitespace] water, and there were no wooden barriers or red lights on either side. Hang, being careless, accidentally fell into the [Whitespace] trench and was suffocated by the mud, unable to climb out, and died. It was not until dawn the next day that a neighbor [Whitespace] glimpsed it and wired [Whitespace] Yang [Whitespace] Pei Police Station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to drag the [Whitespace] corpse out. The police hospital inspected [Whitespace] and ordered [Whitespace] Hang Ming, four [Whitespace] son, to lead [Whitespace]. The negligent person, Du Mingyou, was [Whitespace] investigated by the police [Whitespace] and arrested at five [Whitespace] pm on the fourth [Whitespace] and escorted to the First District Court Police Station [Whitespace]. Attorney Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for negligent homicide [Whitespace], stating that [Whitespace] the company regulations [Whitespace], the place where the trench was dug for water pipes [Whitespace] should [Whitespace] have wooden barriers and red lights to warn pedestrians [Whitespace], and this disaster would not have occurred. [Whitespace] The defendant's confession was hesitant, seeking leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzhi ruled that he should be remanded and rescheduled for review.</p>
<h3>Reaching Via Fujian: Highways Open</h3>
<p>Connections Between Sichuan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang [Whitespace] Quick [Whitespace] but not Comfortable</p>
<p>Dr. Hu Lai of the Fuzhou Rotary Club recently spoke to members of the Rotary Club in this city about transportation in Fujian Province, stating that there is a way to reach the "non-occupied China" from Shanghai. It is said that there are several routes between the occupied and non-occupied areas of China, and taking the route via Fujian Province is one of them. When departing, one can buy a boat ticket to Fuzhou, transfer to a steamboat to Nanping, and then take a long-distance bus to Chengdu or the provincial capitals of Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang. When traveling along this route, one should not have any comfortable thoughts. For example, the small boat he took to Shanghai carried 824 passengers and was extremely crowded. Fortunately, he and a few other foreigners were able to occupy the cabin, which was three times larger than the other passengers'. Hu continued that there are regular long-distance bus routes in Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces, with Nanping as the transportation hub [Whitespace]. A long-distance bus leaves every two weeks. In order to prevent the Japanese army's mechanized units from invading, the Chinese army in Fujian Province has destroyed one-third of the highways, making transportation more difficult than before. At least 100 miles of each highway from the coast into the interior are full of traps, making it difficult even for bicycles to pass. Currently, it is constantly raining for weeks at a time, making the roads difficult to travel.</p>
<h3>National Music Research Society: Regular Public Performances</h3>
<p>Scheduled for the 8th at the Lyceum Theatre</p>
<p>Music can cultivate character and is the best of all proper entertainment. However, today's musicians mostly imitate the West, and our country's inherent string and wind music is regarded as worthless. The National Music Research Society, in view of this, gathered a number of like-minded people under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yude to engage in the research of national music. After years of hard practice, it has recently been heard that the Society is scheduled to give a public performance at the Lyceum Theatre on April 8th. Those who have heard of it and have expressed their support include Mr. Carter, the Commercial Counselor of the United States, Mr. H[Whitespace]mer, the American Judge, Mr. Mc[Whitespace]ai, the Far East Manager of Citibank, Li Weining, and Xie Haiyan. The program includes ensemble performances of "Yu Lun Pao," "Yue Er Gao," "Xunyang Nocturne," "Han Palace Autumn Moon," and "Nostalgia," as well as solo performances of the pipa and dongxiao by Mr. Sun Yude. In addition, Mr. Zhang Ziqian and Mr. Wu Jinglue [Whitespace], famous ancient music masters who are supporting members of the Society, will perform the famous "Puan Zhou" piece on the guqin and guzheng. The grand occasion at that time can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Li Yiting Holds Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Li Yiting, a painter from Shandong Province, specializes in landscapes, figures, birds, and beasts. His brushwork is vigorous. He is known for his ink chicks, which are famous in the northeastern provinces. He has recently moved to Shanghai, and his reputation has increased. It is now heard that from the 7th to the 13th of this month, he will display hundreds of his finest works at the Daxin Company on the fourth floor to establish connections with people in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday was: Shandong and this area will be sunny and cold with fog and gentle northwest to north winds. The coastal area south of Ma'an Island and the area around Dongsha Island will change from cloudy to overcast with localized fog and strong northeasterly winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 55.9 and the lowest was 34.5. On the same day last year, the highest was 61.5 and the lowest was 34.9.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Holds Inspection Conference: Resolves Many Important Inspection Cases</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) In order to improve the inspection system and give full play to the effectiveness of inspections, the Ministry of Education had previously slightly increased the number of inspectors in the Supervisory Department. It is now learned that the Ministry has recently telegraphed all inspectors outside to return to the Ministry and invited heads of various [Whitespace] departments to hold an inspection conference. It opened on April 3rd. Director Yu Jue delivered a speech, stating that Minister Chen, in view of the fact that he had not paid enough attention to assessment work in the past, had expanded the number of inspectors to enable universal inspection and fulfill the function of the three-way administrative system. In the future, it is necessary to pay attention to strengthening the inspection system, contacting inspectors in various schools, and giving full play to the maximum effectiveness of the inspection system. Subsequently, the inspectors reported on the educational situation in various provinces and cities and their suggestions for improvement. The personnel appointed to attend the meeting were assigned to review more than 30 proposals in groups on the 4th, divided into nine categories, including general inspection issues, higher education, secondary education, national education, social [Whitespace] education, border education, medical education, physical education, and service groups. On the 5th, a general meeting was held to resolve many important cases, such as the key points of education inspection at all levels, and personnel were designated to draft an inspection manual, all of which contributed greatly to education inspection. It then closed on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Ancient Children's Books Exhibition Concludes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over 30,000 Visitors</p>
<p>The Chinese Ancient and Modern Children's Books Exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Children's Library Preparatory Committee, officially closed at 6 PM yesterday. According to Mr. Lin Xi Zhi, the director of the exhibition's preparatory committee, the exhibition attracted over 30,000 visitors (mostly children). This signifies that Shanghai society is genuinely paying attention to children's book matters, which is truly exciting. The exhibition benefited from the generous donations of valuable books from book collectors Mr. Luo Hongtao, Ms. Lin Cha Xian, the Guangxuehui, Shaonian Publishing House, Shenzhou Guoguang Society, Children's Guide Newspaper Office, Children's Paradise Society, Guoguang Bookstore, Chunjiang Bookstore, and the 225 Boy Scout Store, among others. The Aurora University Library, the China International Library, the Zhongxi Second Elementary School, the Dazhong Bookstore, the Children's Bookstore, and the Xin Asia Bookstore generously provided complete sets of children's books. Furthermore, the Shanghai Green Treasure Company generously donated a large quantity of soy milk to promote children's health. In addition, Ms. Wu Yizhi, the principal of Shanghai Girls' High School, not only generously provided the venue but also offered guidance. I, on behalf of the Children's Library Preparatory Committee, express our gratitude.</p>

<h3>Observing Shanghai Prices from Statistical Figures</h3>
<p>— Liu Tiesun</p>
<p>Import Volume of Food and Coal (Unit: 1,000 Quintals)</p>
<p>Year | Rice | Wheat | Flour | Miscellaneous Grains | Coal (1,000 Tons)</p>
<p>Observing the above table, the import volume of rice, wheat, flour, and coal not only did not decrease after the war, but mostly increased. What we cannot determine is the amount of domestic rice, wheat, flour, and coal that arrived before the war. If the current import volume can offset the decrease in domestic rice, etc., due to control, then the price increase is not due to blocked sources but to the influence of manipulation and hoarding.</p>
<p>The So-Called Increased Demand</p>
<p>Since the westward shift of the war, the occupied areas have gradually expanded, and people could not bear all kinds of disturbances, so they took the solitary islands as their haven. The housing problem became very serious, and as the population increased, consumption naturally increased. The concession showed a distorted prosperity, which was unprecedented since the opening of the port. According to the Shanghai Yearbook, the population of the city before the war is shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Population Statistics in 1936 (Thousands)</p>
<p>According to the above table, the population of the city before the war was more than 3.8 million, and the two special districts were more than 1.6 million. According to recent newspaper reports, the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that the population of Chinese in the public concession and outside the boundary roads is between 2 million and 2.5 million, and the foreign population is 67,000. In the French concession, there are 2 million Chinese and foreign residents. Therefore, the recent population of Chinese and foreigners in the two special districts and outside the boundary roads is between 4.1 million and 4.6 million, which is 2.5 to 3 times more than before the war.</p>
<p>The So-Called Inflation</p>
<p>Deflation causes prices to fall, while inflation causes prices to rise. There is a correlation between the two. Inflation includes not only banknotes, but also checks—credit inflation—and coins, which are no longer used and can be ignored. The former two are described separately below:</p>
<p>(A) Banknote Inflation: According to the Ministry of Finance, the amount of legal tender issued at the end of June 1940 was 400,000,000 yuan, more than three times higher than before the war. However, since the outbreak of the war, distant and near provinces that used local banknotes or coins have successively taken back legal tender. This requires a considerable amount. Therefore, since the area where legal tender is promoted has expanded and the demand is high, and since legal tender has replaced the previously circulating coins and miscellaneous notes, it is doubtful whether the current increase of three times is inflation.</p>
<p>(B) Credit Inflation: Whether credit is inflated can be observed from the amount of bill exchange in the Shanghai banking industry. (Editor's Note: Table omitted) It decreased from 22.5 million yuan in 1936 to 14.5 million yuan in 1940, so the index decreased from 100 in 1936 to 64 in 1940. Not only has it not inflated, but it has also shown a contraction. Looking at the progress of each year: 1937 was similar to 1936, the amount of bill exchange decreased by 47% in 1938, decreased by more than 50% in 1939, and was better in 1940, but it also reached 36%. However, according to the figures, it has improved considerably by December, and the decrease is only about 15% compared to before the war. Therefore, the claim of credit inflation cannot be established.</p>
<p>In summary, credit shows a contraction. Although the total amount of banknotes issued in the country has increased, it has not yet reached the degree of inflation. The amount of banknotes circulating in Shanghai is difficult to judge because there are no reliable figures. However, those with some assets in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have brought their families and funds with them due to the suffering in the occupied areas. The surplus of floating funds is unprecedented. According to experts quoted in the English Commercial and Financial News, the deposits of Chinese in foreign banks in Shanghai are about 130,000,000 yuan in legal tender, of which about 16,000,000 yuan are deposits in Chinese banks. The deposits stored in Chinese banks are not included. If this huge amount of floating funds is not used for legitimate industrial and commercial operations, it will inevitably flow into speculation, manipulation, and hoarding of goods, posing a direct threat to prices.</p>
<p>The So-Called Foreign Exchange Contraction</p>
<p>Foreign exchange contraction reduces the foreign purchasing power of legal tender, thereby increasing prices. Based on the exchange rates of the US and British currencies listed by HSBC, and compiling the index list below, the index is used in terms of the percentage of increase in order to be consistent with the above tables, and the percentage of contraction is not used. In other words, how many more times of legal tender are needed to exchange for a certain amount of foreign exchange than before the war.</p>
<p>According to the above figures, some commodity prices have increased more than nine times, while the factors affecting commodity price increases have not increased by more than five times. The crux of the matter lies in the floating capital problem. According to experts, the deposits of Shanghai banks are at least 300,000,000 yuan, of which more than 70% are demand deposits, which makes speculation and hoarding very popular. Based on the conclusion of our figures, it can be said that the high price of Shanghai commodities is half due to environmental reasons.</p>
<p>According to the above table, the US and British exchange rates in 1936 and 1937 are similar. In 1938, the US exchange rate shrank by 40% and the British exchange rate shrank by 38% compared to 1936. In 1939, the US exchange rate shrank by 163% and the British exchange rate shrank by 140%. In 1940, the percentage shrinkage of the US exchange rate was 410% and the British exchange rate was 278% compared to 1936. The difference between December 1940 and the annual average is also limited, with the US exchange rate shrinking by 427% and the British exchange rate shrinking by 300% compared to 1936.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons affecting the high price of commodities, we have observed the above based on statistical figures. Now, we will list the percentage increase or decrease of each year from 1937 to 1936 for a comprehensive observation. (The following is a percentage index table based on 1936), while the other half is affected by manipulation. To stabilize commodity prices, the authorities of the two concessions should have considerable restrictions. On the one hand, those with floating capital should have a broader vision and not seek immediate benefits and exhaust the pond to catch the fish. On the government side, although there are various measures to encourage the internal transfer of funds, they should also be effectively implemented. They should understand the people's hardships and ensure that the internal transfer of funds is not hindered. The handling personnel should be fair, so that the laws and regulations can be in line with the facts, so that they can achieve their actual effect. If these two aspects are promoted in parallel, it will not be difficult to stabilize Shanghai's commodity prices. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Seen, Heard, Thought</h3>
<p>Konoe appointed Ogura Masatsune as Minister without Portfolio, not so much because he valued Ogura, but because he valued the Sumitomo zaibatsu. The Sumitomo zaibatsu is known as the Japanese munitions king, starting with heavy industry, and is different from Mitsui and Mitsubishi. Ogura is a veteran of the Sumitomo zaibatsu headquarters and the chief director of Sumitomo.</p>
<p>However, it was not Konoe who succeeded, but Sumitomo's products.</p>
<p>Isn't the Mitsubishi zaibatsu, which also focuses on heavy industry, jealous of Ogura's debut? So they pushed Toyota Teijiro to the chair of Minister of Commerce and Industry, and also promoted him to the rank of naval admiral. Because Toyota is the son-in-law of Takeda Hideo, the pillar of the Mitsubishi zaibatsu!</p>
<p>So who is Suzuki Teiichi, the newly appointed Minister of State and President of the Planning Board? Oh! That's the famous direct line of Araki, regarded as Araki's godson, and those Asia Development Board liaison officers currently stationed in China are his most powerful masses. The goal of the so-called planning is Chinese resources. Aoki is not comparable to Suzuki.</p>
<p>Someone said: The boiling hot speculative market has become a tug-of-war between bulls and bears.</p>
<p>The soaring price of coal balls is the true color of coal balls and the true color of coal merchants.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Council's resignation has been decided for the third time, which is not surprising. It is only because it shines with the humor of Qiaolao's "resignation."</p>
<h3>The Liquid Fuel Problem in Britain and Germany (Continued from Issue 363)</h3>
<p>— Nong</p>
<p>Years before the outbreak of the war, Germany strictly implemented a liquid fuel control policy to limit private consumption in order to increase government reserves. Later, an economic agreement was signed with the Soviet Union, and we can imagine that part of it must have been to solve the liquid fuel problem. But how many tons can the Soviet Union supply? It is questionable. Last year, the German army pointed east and turned Poland into ruins. Poland produces about 5 million barrels of kerosene every year, which is also a small supplement for Germany. Recently, it has forced Romania to join its embrace. In addition to wheat, the biggest goal is kerosene! In addition? She also uses artificial synthesis methods to refine kerosene from coal and coal! She has to find alternatives, using alcohol or vegetable oil to replace part of kerosene! Especially extracting kerosene from coal and coal is such a laborious and costly task! —According to reports from two man-made kerosene factories in Bethune and Lievin, the kerosene produced costs eight to ten times more than importing it from abroad! —This can only be achieved in Germany with its talent, technology, Hitler's resolute and dictatorial madness in a state of preparedness! In this respect, Germany has indeed made amazing progress and development. However, this is only solving a very small part of the problem; it is still impossible to say that the kerosene she produces artificially is sufficient to meet the needs!</p>
<p>Even if the kerosene procurement and artificial manufacturing procedures are completed, there are still transportation, storage, and refining problems. Regarding the transportation problem, Britain is able to maintain its maritime traffic, while Germany is completely revolving on the mainland. The difficulty of the storage problem lies in the complex organization of liquid fuel and it is quite dangerous. For example, for kerosene storage ponds, they must be "turned over" at least twice a year; warehouses containing battle gasoline or aircraft gasoline also require precise design and safe areas; because you always have to remember that it is going to be bombed and destroyed by the enemy in wartime. The refining problem is that gasoline, especially aircraft gasoline, needs to have excellent quality and needs to contain a large amount of octane. According to statistics, the kerosene produced in various European countries is generally not sufficient for refining into aircraft gasoline; even the best kerosene in various countries, the production of aircraft gasoline cannot exceed 20%; therefore, the number of suitable kerosene is quite small. Moreover, after aircraft gasoline is successfully distilled, in order to prevent it from damaging the engine during combustion, it is necessary to add several other rare substances: such as iso-octane, tetraethyl lead (Plomb tetraethile), ethylene bromide (bromure’d’ethylene). However, the chemical materials problem is not a big problem for Germany. Take the octane needed for aircraft gasoline as an example: before the First European War, she produced the most; what is still a problem for her is still the acquisition of gasoline.</p>
<h3>A Discussion of Controlled Economy</h3>
<p>— From Germany</p>
<p>The origin of the controlled economic organization was the result of various economic and social problems after the last World War, but its historical source can be said to have existed long ago. Therefore, studying the historical source of the controlled economic organization can be divided into two aspects: (1) Why was the controlled economic organization able to take concrete form in 1918-1920? (2) Why did this kind of organization lead to different directions in various countries? Before the decisive war, the source of thought for controlled economy was formed by three kinds of thoughts: (1) The socialist movement as the basis of its occurrence; (2) Ideological movements originating from political conservatism; (3) Ideological movements originating from advocating other methods to replace national organizations. Let us first explain the socialist movement. Socialists have always advocated that economic collective groups are the most ideal organizational structure for mankind, and there is often a slogan in the socialist revolutionary movement, namely, to organize social laborers. Since socialism believes that laborers are a collective based on economic organization, in other words, a group based on economic organization is more thorough than other organizational entities. Therefore, socialists believe that all groups should be based on the principle of no political organization, so that it can be hoped that the combination of public economy can be satisfied and public economic life can be fulfilled. Since 1880, the stance taken by socialists has been how to attempt to control parliament in order to overthrow the democratic system, but after 1900, the socialist movement did not change its position on industrial socialism. The position of this ideological movement is reflected in France as syndicalism, in England as Guild socialism, and in the United States as the organization of the Industrial Workers of the World. Although the organizations in these three countries, which are reflected by the ideological movement of industrial socialism, have different ambitions, they can be summarized as the initial socialist thought on economic organization.</p>
<p>Between 1915 and 1916, many social and economic problems arose with the war. The factors of these many problems already existed, but they became more obvious due to the stimulation of the war. Many pre-war phenomena were more concretely manifested during the war. On the government side, it was felt that the national resources must be controlled and the human organizational power must be coordinated in order to fully realize the goal of external warfare. In Germany, a slogan was first called out, advocating the organization of an economic parliament to manage the national economy. In the United States, there was the National Labor Board and the National Trade Bureau to control industry. In Britain and France, there was the organization of the Economic Advisory Committee. The work of this kind of organization was to enable the raw materials needed by the national industry to obtain sources of supply and to adjust transportation and markets. However, the slogan that Germany called out soon subsided. This was entirely due to the influence of the Soviet Union's economic plan in 1917. At that time, Germany saw the first step of the Bolshevik revolution, which was to concentrate the national industries, and entrust the power of management to the workers. At the same time, the committee system of the Economic Commission was similar to that of Germany, so the German slogan subsided from then on. According to the second step of the Bolshevik revolution, the profession replaced the parliament, which was a great stimulus to capitalist countries. Therefore, after 1917, different developments occurred in various countries, and the revolutionary faction advocated reforming the economic institutions. Even President Wilson of the United States called out a new slogan, the so-called restoration system, that is, politics and economy are integrated. Similar calls for economic control were also made in Britain and France. In fact, the meaning of the four words "controlled economy" can be known from the events that occurred in 1918, and different interpretations of the concept of controlled economy were generated. Some people say that controlled economy is a faction of anti-democrats before the decisive war. Some people say that controlled economy is a joint organization between the legislative and executive branches and an advisory body. In other words, controlled economy is a process to help the development of democracy or the implementation of socialism, so that the country can promote its policies on a new socialist basis.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Towels</h3>
<p>— Guo Xiushi</p>
<p>Towels are one of the daily necessities. Since coarse Korean cloth hand towels were phased out, towels have become very popular.</p>
<p>The earliest towels imported to China were Japanese "Anchor Brand" towels, which were of thick and soft quality, so people at that time generally used them. At the beginning of the Republic of China, after domestic towels came out, people enthusiastically promoted domestic goods in response to the boycott in the fourth year of the Republic of China. At that time, domestic towels that could be compared with imported goods were "Triangle Brand" towels, which were of quite thick and soft quality, so they were warmly welcomed by the people at that time, especially the overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands. Since the boycott movement, many domestic towel manufacturers have emerged. "Anchor Brand" towels disappeared invisibly in a few years. Here, domestic towels can indeed defeat foreign goods, which is truly a great achievement in the domestic goods industry!</p>
<p>Towels are pure cotton woven products, mainly made of single yarn. Although there are also those woven with double strands, they are not very common, because the texture of double strands is hard and unsuitable for practical use. Towels woven with single yarn are easier to absorb water and are soft, so they are the most common.</p>
<p>Towels are divided into "raw yarn" and "cooked yarn": "Raw yarn" towels are rough and hard, do not absorb water when wet, and feel like fish bones pricking the skin when wiping the face; "Cooked yarn" towels do not have this problem, because cooked yarn towels have strong water absorption, sink when wet, and feel exceptionally soft when wiping the face!</p>
<p>The identification method of "raw yarn" towels and "cooked yarn" towels is described as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Please buy two towels, one is "raw yarn" and the other is "cooked yarn". Please put a little bit of clean water (regardless of cold or hot water) on the two different towels, and you can know that the one that absorbs water is the "cooked yarn" towel, and the one with water droplets floating on the surface of the towel yarn is undoubtedly the "raw yarn" towel.</p>
<p>2.  After bleaching, "cooked yarn" towels have a transparent, white, and tender color; "raw yarn" towels, although bleached in the same way, have a rough, dark, and dull color.</p>
<p>In addition to being mainly used for wiping the face, towels can also be used as towel fabrics, towel bed sheets, blankets, and bath towels. Towel fabrics can also be used to make bathrobes, pajamas, children's bibs, diapers, and even women's menstrual belts, etc., because towel products are mostly chosen for their softness and water absorption.</p>

<h3>Coal Merchants' Hearts Are Darker Than Coal; Coal Briquettes Surge in the Black Market</h3>
<p>Last time, the price of coal briquettes suddenly increased by forty yuan per ton. According to the industry's self-defense, this was because of the lack of neutral ships for Annam's Hongji self-coal fines, and the water foot increased sharply, with freight increasing from six US dollars to twelve US dollars per ton. However, the sudden increase of forty yuan per ton was enough to prompt a strike to demand subsidies. The manufacturers only know how to protect their own interests, and often the price of coal briquettes rises before the raw materials rise, so they make huge profits, ignoring the workers' difficulties in life, resulting in a three-day strike. This strike was the result of the manufacturers' excessive profit-making. Unexpectedly, the strike caused speculation among general hoarders, who thought that the strike would increase wages and affect costs, and the price would have to rise again. In fact, coal briquettes are all made by machines, and labor only accounts for a few percent in transportation and management, which is very small. It should not rise again and again. Because of this hoarding, when the labor dispute was resolved and the factories started work, they used the excuse of clearing old warehouse receipts to limit spot sales, and even stop selling, waiting for a good price, so the stores on the street without warehouse receipts had no goods to sell. Even if they were lucky enough to buy them, they were limited to one basket (i.e. five dan), which was not enough to meet the demand. Therefore, most of the coal briquette stores on the street have been empty these days. The actions of the coal briquette factories are simply disregarding the lives of the masses and implementing large-scale manipulation and hoarding in order to raise the market price and then raise the factory price again. Their sinister intentions and cunning methods are beyond description. If the manufacturers really want to prevent hoarding, then most of the hoarders hold warehouse receipts. They should not clear the warehouse receipts first and then the spot goods. They should first respond to the retail market and then gradually deliver the warehouse receipts. In this way, there will be goods for sale in the retail market, people will not panic, and the market price will not rise. In the end, it is because a few large factories have insatiable desires, wanting tens of millions and then tens of thousands, making false claims and making huge profits from the national crisis, which is the same style as hoarding rice. What is even more hateful is that they deliberately delay the resolution of the subsidy issue, using this as an excuse and not starting work, resulting in a large reduction in the production of coal briquettes and a soaring black market price. This is also related. Alas, the hearts of coal merchants are darker than coal! (Mei)</p>
<h3>Excess of Idle Capital; Cash Needs to Be Charged a Fee</h3>
<p>The Money Bank Continues to Suspend the Acceptance of Banknotes</p>
<p>Recently, due to the increase in the influx of cash from other ports such as Hong Kong into this city, there has been an excess of cash. Recently, the head fee for cash transfer has reached more than thirty yuan per ten thousand yuan, that is, one thousand yuan for the head, and more than one thousand and thirty yuan for the cash. The money industry reserve bank continues to suspend the acceptance of cash. Its notice to various banks says, "Previously, because the number of banknotes accumulated in this bank was quite large, the executive committee decided to temporarily suspend the acceptance of banknotes for one week from March 27th. It has already been announced. Now, because this transfer work is still difficult, the suspension date has to be extended continuously." It is also reported that recently, many reasons for dishonoring checks in various banks and money houses are "only accepting cash."</p>
<h3>Period Crude White Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot crude white was tighter, futures stabilized, Dutch red was slightly looser, and car white rebounded slightly. The association quoted the spot price of outer warehouse at 87.9 to 87.7 yuan, up 4 to 2 corners. The futures price for April 10 was 87.8 yuan, and the futures price for April 20 was 88.4, 4 corners and a half, 5 corners and a half, with little change. Dutch red was 68 yuan, down 5 corners. Taikoo car white DY mark was 84 yuan, up 5 corners. There were few other transactions.</p>
<h3>Longkou Vermicelli Sees New High Price Again</h3>
<p>Longkou thread vermicelli is in short supply due to the lack of arrivals, and the market is becoming increasingly thin. Therefore, although it is not the peak sales season now, the market trend is directly developing towards a high point. Yesterday, the market price had reached 140 yuan, an increase of more than 30 yuan. Other Qingdao vermicelli was 180 yuan, and Jiangbei vermicelli and soup vermicelli were all priced at 96 to 97 yuan, with little change.</p>
<h3>White Lead Skin is Extremely Quiet and Thinks of Moving</h3>
<p>The market image of white lead skin, which has been silent for a long time, has been aroused by the search of bookstores and type foundries in this street since the day before yesterday. It is found that the stock bottom of this cargo in Shanghai is thin, because Belgium has long been without goods for loading, and the only thing that can respond to the market is what was stored in the past. Therefore, under the search, the market goods have the image of being insufficient. Among them, the 8 and 9 colors are most strongly absorbed by the printing houses, and the market goods are in danger of being sold out. Therefore, the price of this color is much higher than that of other goods. At the moment, each barrel of No. 8 and 9 costs 4,500 yuan, while goods of No. 4, 5, 6, and 7 only cost 4,200 yuan (because these colors are popular goods for battery factories, but recently the business of this gang is idle, so there is not much sales for the white lead skin).</p>
<h3>Bitter Almonds Rebound After Extreme Fatigue</h3>
<p>Bitter almonds have been in a sluggish market for a long time due to the thick arrivals and stocks. Recently, they have gradually stabilized and rebounded. The price has risen by 5 yuan from the lowest. The higher market price yesterday was 90 yuan, and the decision was 87 or 88 yuan. If the destocking is active, it is still expected to tighten again.</p>
<h3>Armadillo Scales Stock is About to Run Out</h3>
<p>Armadillo scales have been in short supply for a long time, and the goods in the market have been sold out. The stock in the line is also limited. Therefore, the market price has risen again and again, and high peaks have been seen repeatedly. The current market price is more than 700 yuan, and there are still markets but no goods. It is said that the company is looking for a solution, but it has not been settled for a while.</p>

<h3>Common Sense of Life Problems</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Everyone hopes to have a healthy body, but their ideals often contradict their lives. "To be healthy, you must have moderation in your life, and to have moderation in your life, you must pay attention to self-training and self-sacrifice." This is the faithful advice of Dr. Ivos Beaumont, a famous British doctor. He also has several groups of life questions for us to ask and answer ourselves at any time, and to examine ourselves at any time. It can be said that it is of great benefit to us. Now I will transcribe it below:</p>
<p>The first group: about sleep. There are three questions: 1. Can you fall asleep at any time, without choosing a place? 2. Can you sleep during an air raid alarm? 3. Do you feel comfortable when you wake up in the morning after sleeping all night? (The author is a famous doctor, assuming that your answers are all negative, so what follows is that he finds out the reasons for you or helps you correct them.) 1. This is because you cannot discard all your thoughts. 2. We should have a concept that it is always more pleasant to fall asleep during an air raid alarm than to stay awake, then you are not afraid of not being able to sleep. 3. If you often do not feel comfortable when you wake up after sleeping all night, there are only two reasons: the indoor air is not circulating when you sleep, or you have not cleared away the troubles of the day before going to bed. As long as you pay attention to opening the windows of the bedroom when you sleep, and do not bring your troubles to bed, or starting tomorrow, you will not feel uncomfortable!</p>
<p>The second group: about clothing. There are two questions: 1. Do you change your clothes according to the climate? 2. Do you still feel warm when the weather is cold? (The author assumes that your answers are all positive, so what follows is just a few words that seem to explain it.) 1. Clothes can maintain a person's normal temperature, so clothes must be changed according to the climate. 2. Wearing tight-fitting knitted fabrics, the wind is not easy to penetrate, so even if the weather is cold, your body will still be warm.</p>
<p>The third group: about exercise. There are three questions: 1. Are you unable to get enough exercise opportunities? 2. Do you like exercise? 3. Does your body start to feel tired before you exercise excessively? (For this group of questions, the author assumes that your answers are negative again; now he has a lot of guidance for you.) 1. Those who lack exercise opportunities should do five minutes of jumping morning exercises every morning and a ten-minute walk before going to bed. 2. Those who do not like exercise should initially choose a few interesting sports or participate in some competitive games, and they will naturally like it slowly. 3. If the body starts to feel tired before the exercise, if the doctor's examination shows that there is no organ disease, then the exercise time can be increased day by day; stop when you start to feel tired, but do not be afraid of fatigue and do not exercise.</p>
<p>The fourth group: about diet. There are two questions: 1. Although it has not been long since the meal, do you often feel hungry? 2. Is your appetite not normal? (In this group of questions, the author gives us a simple analysis from a self-centered perspective.) 1. The reason for this phenomenon is mostly because of excessive stomach acid or diabetes. If it is the latter, the weight will definitely decrease. 2. Gastritis, dental disease, blood loss, and heavy smoking can all cause abnormal appetite. The first step of treatment is to ask a doctor to examine your body, clear your bowels, and quit smoking.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Abolish the Lining of Men's Long Robes</h3>
<p>— Li Xia</p>
<p>The price of clothing materials is quite considerable. When it comes to clothes, you have to be more economical. But in Shanghai, where clothes are more important than people, being too broken is not okay. Even if you are innocent, you will still run into obstacles everywhere. Therefore, if you must do it, you have to think about it and not cut too much material and be ripped off by the tailor. Like us women, it is enough to cut seven feet for three and a half feet long, but it is not enough for men. Although their body circumference is relatively large, on the other hand, the lining has to occupy at least three feet of cloth. If it is one yuan a foot, it costs three yuan, isn't that more expensive than women? Aren't men and women equal now? Why do men's robes, whether they are single shirts, have to add a long and human lining? Moreover, let us think, isn't a person's body uniform? Then why does the right half of the body need an extra layer in particular? Is the nerve on the right half particularly afraid of cold? Moreover, every day like this, one side is more and the other side is less, which also has a considerable hindrance to the breathing and development of the lungs. We see, the suits worn by Westerners are sewn open, and there is absolutely no disadvantage of one side being more and the other side being less. Moreover, I have also asked most men, and they also feel that this is superfluous, but the habit is like this, and they are too lazy to change it. Finally, I hope that people of prestige and elders will set an example and make a call, and then the masses will follow suit. Moreover, all things change with the times. If you know the disadvantages, then change it. Why stick to preconceived ideas and remain unchanged? This matter is both economical and hygienic. I hope everyone will make a new reform!</p>
<h3>Talking About Spring Bamboo Shoots</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Recently, the most popular dishes are spring bamboo shoots (Shanghainese call them bamboo shoots, also called light bamboo shoots), because their taste is delicious, and they are the best of any vegetarian dishes. Moreover, they can be added to every kind of meat and vegetable dish. If they are baked in oil alone, they are also very tasty, and they are suitable for serving with rice and wine. Or boil them with salt water and dry them in the sun, which is dried bamboo shoots, which can be stored for a long time and have a special flavor when used in human dishes or soup.</p>
<p>It is rumored that people who do not eat bamboo shoots are not easy to grow old, but people always love to eat them because of their deliciousness. They are produced after the awakening of insects every year, when the weather gradually warms and the spring bamboo shoots in the bamboo garden sprout angrily. At this time, the villagers dig them out of the soil, carry them into the market to sell. In the past, when the price of bamboo shoots was the cheapest, one corner or so could buy a catty. It is a kind of delicious food with low price and good quality, but this year, the prices of all things have risen, and vegetables are also under control, so the bamboo shoots of recent days still cost more than half a yuan per catty. Living expenses have risen, and even bamboo shoots will not be able to be eaten.</p>
<h3>Soy Sauce Can Cure Stomach Diseases</h3>
<p>— Baima</p>
<p>After reading the article "Soy Sauce and Stomach Disease" by Qing Cong in the last issue of this column, I feel that there are many differences from what I have heard, and it seems that I have to briefly describe a few words. In fact, there are more than two types of soy sauce production methods, including four types: one is traditional brewing, which must be made in summer; the second is the improved method, which does not rely on natural mold but uses koji bacteria, which can be brewed at any time; the third is the fast brewing method, which can be heated to shorten the period; the fourth is the chemical method, which produces a kind of fresh juice called "amino acid", which is a very concentrated tonic. Mr. Xu Zhuodai's "Soy Sauce Sutra" discusses the common sense of soy sauce in great detail. These four types are not only harmless, but also nourishing, and can also cure stomach diseases, diabetes, beriberi, heart disease, etc. As for the residue of seasoning powder, Mr. Xu calls it fake soy sauce, which is not listed in the four types of soy sauce. The world does not observe, and this fake soy sauce is also regarded as chemical soy sauce, which is not only a big mistake in name, but also a big difference in nature. Chemical soy sauce is a great tonic, while fake soy sauce is really unsanitary. Although chemical soy sauce is also extracted with hydrochloric acid, the one used is synthetic hydrochloric acid. After being neutralized with "sodium", it has no acidity: while the manufacture of seasoning powder often does not use synthetic hydrochloric acid but uses industrial hydrochloric acid. Industrial hydrochloric acid is made from sulfuric acid. Although it has been neutralized, there are many impurities in the sulfuric acid, which is really harmful and useless. Therefore, it is not soy sauce itself that is harmful, but fake soy sauce.</p>
<h3>Talking About Poverty</h3>
<p>— Zuo Zhuan</p>
<p>"Rich people" talking about poverty always inevitably feels a bit like "scratching an itch from outside their boots"; but it is most "intimate" to have a "poor boy" talk about poverty. I will serve as the "preface".</p>
<p>Speaking of poverty, it really makes a bit of a "stingy" appearance: people always talk about dancing in three sentences, and do not say anything about movies in two voices; to be more "serious", they also want to "eat in" and "throw out" with every mouth and voice... If you tighten your waist and shout "suppress rice prices" with a hoarse throat, it is already not very "pretty"; let alone openly talking about poverty to the public?</p>
<p>"Ugly" to the core!</p>
<p>However, "ugly is still ugly, and I will be poor myself." And "old face" to talk again!</p>
<p>First, pull a common saying: "A net does not match cloth, and poverty does not match wealth." The meaning of this "match" is "cannot be mentioned on the same day"! If you want to squeeze in hard, you will inevitably be ridiculed for "ants shaking big trees" and being overconfident!</p>
<p>Therefore, "rich people" can rest assured that I will never dare to stroke "tiger whiskers" and "ask for trouble"! I will talk about the affairs of the poor:</p>
<p>We poor people, people always say that we are born with a "bone"; and what they say is not wrong: cheeks are thin, limbs are thin, the color is vegetable yellow, and the stomach is empty. And when walking, they often have to bend their backs, lower their heads, and tiptoe. (In fact, this is because they have to "stand out" in front of the "rich people" who stick out their chests, bulge their stomachs, and walk with their heads held high!) Therefore, poor people are often scolded as "cheap appearances" and cannot go to "occasions"... Of course, they cannot "match" the "rich bones" with "thin skin" and "white meat"!</p>
<p>As for when poor people are destitute, it is really a bit "embarrassing": the stomach can be filled with "unscientific" methods, and eating is something that cannot be omitted. From drinking porridge and soup to gnawing on big... from gnawing on human cakes to drinking boiled water... Otherwise, the cotton is stripped off the body, and the padded is reluctantly worn; the padded is stripped off and stuffed into the quilt to end it! Anyway, as long as you don't go to the road to "make a fool of yourself"... the "five internal organs temple" must be "repaired" even if you sell your children!</p>
<p>Poor people have to be "poorly busy" all day long. Even if they are free, they don't have the "fortune" to "relax", to watch, to play, to... These are all "rich people's" "patents"; the only "entertainment" for poor people is to hold "food and clothing meetings" with their families, advocating "spirit instead of material"... No, freezing and starving are more uncomfortable than death! Rather than sitting and starving to death, it is better to take the risk. When you are extremely poor, you rob!</p>
<p>At that time, hum! They won't care what "rich people" or "poor people" you are!</p>
<p>Oh no, talking about poverty has also come to talk about "rich people" again. It is really "it is easy to change mountains and rivers, but it is difficult to change one's nature." The poor people are just "not good" with hard mouths.</p>
<p>"How can that be unwritten?"</p>
<p>Then, since you are "asking for trouble", then "don't open your poor mouth"...</p>

<h3>A Week's Home-Style Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Recently, among fish, yellow croaker is still the cheapest. You can buy a fairly large yellow croaker for just twenty cents. There are many ways to prepare yellow croaker. The most common are braising in soy sauce, stir-frying with vinegar, pan-frying with scallions, or simmering with finely chopped pickled mustard greens in a clear broth. You can use the whole fish or cut it into pieces. There is no need for soy sauce, just a clear broth, which is very flavorful. Another option is deep-fried yellow croaker, where the fish is cut into pieces, marinated in soy sauce for a moment, then coated in batter and deep-fried. It is very suitable as a snack with wine. The author personally loves yellow croaker soup. First, steam the yellow croaker until cooked, remove the bones, add a little soy sauce and aged wine, and braise with amaranth and diced bamboo shoots. If you don't use soy sauce, you can add a little salt and braise it in white broth. Add a little pepper when serving for an irresistible flavor. Currently, amaranth is not yet in season, but lettuce leaves can be used as a substitute, which is also fragrant and delicious.</p>

<h3>A Nation Centered on Travel</h3>
<p>— Yang Xin</p>
<p>In the mountains of southwestern China, there live many unique ethnic groups, such as the Miao, Yao, and Yi people. In the past, due to ethnic prejudice, hatred, and suspicion, the Han people had little contact with them, and our knowledge of their lives was limited to mythological legends. Only recently have the Chinese people begun to pay attention. Here, I would like to introduce the ancient Zong people of the Yi ethnic group, whose lives are centered on "travel."</p>
<p>The distribution area of the ancient Zong people is centered around Zhongdian, Deqin, and Ba'an in Yunnan Province. They are born with strong, tall bodies, good at walking and enduring hardship. From a young age, they learn the skills of herding livestock, cooking, and setting up tents. Horse riding and shooting are also their specialties. They rely on these skills to trade between Kang and Tibet, and the Hengduan Mountains. They transport tea and sugar from the Han people to Tibet, and then transport wool and wool fabrics from there back. They make a large profit in the process, making them a very wealthy ethnic group.</p>
<p>Their food, "tsampa" and yak butter tea are their daily staples. "Tsampa" sounds very unfamiliar. It is made from "qingke" barley, and eaten by mixing it with yak butter tea by hand. Yak butter tea is made by mixing salt and yak butter into tea, giving it a slightly fishy taste. The ancient Zong people treat guests with it as an unwritten custom. Undoubtedly, their food is also related to their lifestyle. As long as they pack "tsampa," a brick of tea, salt, and yak butter in their backpacks, they can go anywhere. It is also very nutritious!</p>
<p>In terms of clothing, the colors are mostly purple. I think this has a lot to do with the surrounding environment and the tone of the high mountain desert. The clothes are called "chuba," made of Tibetan wool fabrics, which are wide and large. The upper half is usually tied around the waist, serving as a raincoat and a sleeping bag.</p>
<p>Housing: Because they are a traveling ethnic group, they don't pay much attention to housing. Ordinary houses are made of wooden boards, divided into two levels. The upper level is for people to live in, and the lower level is for livestock. People go up the short ladder in the yard. The ancient Zong people probably still retain the characteristics of nomadic peoples, caring for livestock and living with them? But because the climate is cold there, there is no smell. When traveling, they set up tents to rest, just like scout camps, which can be moved at any time, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about their trade routes, which go east through the Hengduan Mountains to Kangding, and west through the Hengduan Mountains, over the grasslands to Lhasa. Many of the places along the way are famous for being difficult to pass, but the ancient Zong people pass through them as if walking on flat ground. Ah! What a poetic and adventurous ethnic group!</p>

<h3>High</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>High, the aspiration of all.</p>
<p>"Morons" want to climb high, want to rise high, want to jump high; "Third Sons" want to be "Young Masters," "Young Masters" want to be "Elders," and "Elders" want to be "Upper Class Chinese." Once "high," then "old and virtuous," "highly respected," and naturally "crowned high" will follow.</p>
<p>High, also the reason for universal striving.</p>
<p>But people are ultimately only six or seven feet tall. Achieving "a nine-foot giant" is already difficult enough. As for "a twelve-foot monk," one is ultimately "clueless."</p>
<p>Therefore, one must find ways to make oneself "high," higher than everything...</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it." So, those with "intent" will surely find a way. When the way comes, they place everyone else beneath their feet, denying them even the right to a sip of porridge, while they themselves "stand high" above.</p>
<p>However, whether these "stepping stones" are reliable is also questionable, because the greater the pressure, the "higher" the resistance!</p>
<h3>That Day, April 4th</h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>Da Hu was dreaming. He was having unprecedented good luck: the garbage dump was full of copper coins, shining golden copper coins! He kept picking them up. Picking and picking, his broken basket was filled to the brim, overflowing, but he still couldn't pick them all up. The copper coins kept increasing...</p>
<p>But a cry woke him up!</p>
<p>He opened one eye halfway. His thirteen-year-old sister was sitting on a low stool, crying. Her shoulders were twitching, crying like an old woman. Her face and hands were smeared with blood in several places.</p>
<p>"Don't blame the 'Foreman'! It must be your own fault that you get beaten every other day. Still crying!" His father roared.</p>
<p>Da Hu immediately understood what was going on. He jumped up from the muddy ground in one leap, lowered his head, ran to the corner of the wall, grabbed the two tools placed there, and ran out the door.</p>
<p>In front of the door, Er Hu was playing with Xiao Hu. Er Hu's cheeks were smeared with black mud, and the mud ball smeared Xiao Hu's face. Xiao Hu grinned, giggling foolishly.</p>
<p>The weather was very nice. The early spring morning breeze brushed Da Hu's face with a hint of chill. Da Hu took a deep breath, and immediately a foul odor rushed into his nose. Over there, the willow tree next to the cannery had already put on a light, fluttering new green coat. Many women were already washing dirty lead sheets in front of the factory. Da Hu could see his mother working with her head down.</p>
<p>For some reason, Da Hu suddenly felt sorry for his mother, his sister, Er Hu, and Xiao Hu. Maybe his father was also pitiful, but he didn't like his father very much. His father was too prone to anger and treated them four, and his mother, unkindly!</p>
<p>Then, he thought of the stove in the house, made of a few broken bricks, which was still cold at this time. Sweet potato peels lay quietly on the ground. In a moment, Xiao Hu would definitely cry, demanding to eat sweet potato peel paste...</p>
<p>Running closer to the garbage dump, Da Hu's heart couldn't help but pound. If, if he really encountered such good luck, his sister, his mother...even his father wouldn't need to sell "tofu pudding"! The people in the low houses here all dumped their garbage here. And weren't those in the big houses doing the same? Maybe, the chief steward in the white shirt would inadvertently dump money along with it...</p>
<p>Thinking, thinking, Da Hu bent down. The iron tool in his hand drilled and picked through the garbage dump. Before long, he felt something. His hands began to tremble. What could it be?</p>
<p>He quickly scraped away the coal ash, waste paper, fruit peels...on top, and opened his eyes wide to see: "Damn it! A baby!"</p>
<p>Spitting, he continued to dig. Nothing! There was not even one! That "baby" just stared at him with a pair of dead eyes. Spring flies buzzed on its straw-like messy hair.</p>
<p>A string of songs came from the road: "Hehe, such a good world, it's ours! Beautiful and broad! Brothers and sisters, it's ours!...</p>
<p>Da Hu simply stopped digging and ran over to see.</p>
<p>More than forty children of his age: boys and girls, two in a row; walked and sang like a snake. The one in the lead was holding a small flag. Two men and women wearing glasses walked beside them.</p>
<p>"Play! Celebrate! It's ours! La, la, la, la!"</p>
<p>Suddenly someone bumped into Da Hu and ran past like lightning. Da Hu saw that it was a stinky kid. Immediately, a burst of leather boots sounded behind him: a fat policeman!</p>
<p>Da Hu flashed to the opposite side. Watching.</p>
<p>The fat policeman grabbed the child at the corner and gave him a heavy slap. The child staggered a few times, and blood flowed from his nose. Da Hu found a black car parked on the other side of the road.</p>
<p>He quickly turned around and sat down in front of a doorway. He heard his stomach rumble.</p>
<p>The sun shone brightly. The wind spread warmth. From over there came the gradually fading song:</p>
<p>"Hehe, such a good world, it's ours! Beautiful and broad! Brothers and sisters, it's ours! La, la, la, la!..."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(6) Product of Love</p>
<p>"I really have no choice, my heart has simply never returned to Beijing. These short few days have felt like dozens of years to me," Qiu Haitang said, holding a cup of the clear tea that the mute maid had just handed him, staring intently at Xiangqi.</p>
<p>Xiangqi unconsciously slowly lowered her head.</p>
<p>"If you are really worried that he will come, I will go back tonight as usual!" Qiu Haitang stepped his right foot on the threshold, leaned his upper body slightly forward, held the teacup with both hands, and shifted his gaze from Xiangqi to the courtyard outside.</p>
<p>This was a small dog well between the second and third courtyards, filled with many chrysanthemums. A small kitten was lying on the flower stand basking in the sun, drowsing.</p>
<p>"Why bother?" Xiangqi also slowly stood beside the long window. "Now that you're here, let's forget everything and have a few happy days!... Who knows how much of this kind of day we have left...!"</p>
<p>Speaking of this, Xiangqi and Qiu Haitang couldn't help but smile bitterly at the same time.</p>
<p>But the following two days were indeed very happy. The mute maid obviously also knew their thoughts, and was almost more attentive to Qiu Haitang than Xiangqi. On the third night, Qiu Haitang also found a newly embroidered begonia in Xiangqi's bedroom, hanging neatly and properly on the wall next to the iron bed, with a very exquisite frame and colorful tassels, which made him so grateful that he almost shed tears.</p>
<p>"The grace of a beauty is the most difficult to bear," Qiu Haitang casually picked up a pencil and wrote this line of poetry vertically and horizontally on the back of a newly torn calendar a dozen or twenty times, still without putting down the pen.</p>
<p>Xiangqi was watching by the side and couldn't help but chuckle to herself.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Tragic Death of Wang Du</h3>
<p>— Qian Di</p>
<p>Wang Yanqin and Du Hongbin's tragic deaths are a play, a tragedy! They both had shortcomings, but they were also very lovable. They were young, they were young people with flesh and blood, souls, and emotions. Young people should not indulge in the arena of love, should not wander down the wrong path, and should not harm their own lives with their own hands! This is a little thought that I personally drew from their "tragic death," beyond "sighing" and "sympathy."</p>
<p>This love-killing case seems very ordinary on the surface, but it is not ordinary when you think about it carefully.</p>
<p>There are really many naive but pitifully immature girls like Wang Yanqin in this society; there are also absolutely no shortage of intelligent but equally immature young people like Du Hongbin in this society. So this should be said to be a social problem, a terrible and serious social problem.</p>
<p>"Who killed them?" Many people ask and suspect this.</p>
<p>Wang Yanqin was very naive, but she had shortcomings; Du Hongbin was very smart, but he also had shortcomings. They could not overcome these shortcomings together, thus causing a tragic death, an unfortunate tragic death, a completely worthless tragic death!</p>
<p>When I visited Wang Yanqin's family, her father Wang Xiaoqing said with tears in his eyes:</p>
<p>"I like Yanqin very much, she is smart, she is naive, she is lively, but what she lacks is not having received a good education."</p>
<p>Du Hongbin's teacher Liu Ziyun also said:</p>
<p>"Hongbin lost his parents' upbringing very early. He came to my troupe to learn opera at the age of fifteen. He was very smart, learned one thing and understood one thing, and even if you didn't teach him, he would secretly learn on his own. This kind of hard work and self-motivation is very difficult to find. Even after he met Yanqin, he often taught Yanqin opera and even encouraged her to read and write. However, what Hongbin lacked was not having the mind to judge the importance of a matter. He just acted on a momentary emotional impulse, committing the crime first and then committing suicide. This is extremely wrong."</p>
<p>From their conversations, I can know that the reason for their death was: "immaturity," and the impression they gave people after their death was: "pitiful"!</p>
<p>We hope that people in general will have a clear view of this love-killing case, not just treat it as a "talk and laugh" story, but should use it to warn each other and earnestly remember the responsibilities of young people!</p>
<h3>Corpses in the Streets</h3>
<p>— Qiang</p>
<p>People say that today's world is really not like a world. Going to a public toilet costs five cents (with a free big sheet of toilet paper). Before the war, a bowl of rice cost seven coppers, and two bowls for a meal cost only fourteen coppers. Now, taking a dump costs fifteen coppers. Alas, pooping is more expensive than eating!</p>
<p>Indeed, what kind of world is this becoming!</p>
<p>Rice prices and commodity prices are breaking records every day. Rice is already rushing past the hundred-dollar mark, and a box of matches costs eleven cents.</p>
<p>Mencius once said: "There are corpses in the streets, but they do not know to distribute [food]. When people die, they say it is not my fault, it is the year."</p>
<p>Hoarding is still hoarding; cornering the market is still cornering the market; manipulation is still manipulation!</p>
