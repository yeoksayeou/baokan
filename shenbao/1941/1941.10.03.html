<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國作戰的收穫</h3>
<p>本報昨論湘北戰局，謂日軍攻勢漸成弩末，已陷入遭受包圍之中，而料其敗退之期將不在遠。然而事實上的發展却比較意念的想像更迅速，自從九月卅日午後，華軍即向包圍中的日軍猛烈環攻，日軍則突圍向岳州敗退。在日軍當局，果如吾人所料，表示日軍已於昨日由長沙及其附近一帶開始「轉鋒」，「復歸原有姿態」，其理由自然又是「作戰目的業已完成」。日軍作戰目的畢竟何在，自非外人所能知其詳，但就此次戰事初起時日當局的表示來看，似乎其目的遠非如此忽遽進退者所能完成。據戰爭哲學的天才理論家克魯索維茨解釋：戰爭目的在解除一個國家的武裝。消滅其反抗的可能性，爲了貫澈這種目的，則必須消滅敵人武力，佔領其領土，並摧毀其意志；日軍在湘北的行動，究竟完成了上述那一項任務，這是需要日方予以具體解釋的。現在中國在湘北的領土無恙，軍力完整，意志更在蓬勃奮發中，以此適足證明華方所指稱凡此一切發展悉屬預定戰略的發展結果，到確實是顛撲不破的眞理。</p>
<p>其實中國作戰實力增强的表現，正不僅湘北一役爲然，不過近頃國人往往對於國際方面種種動態關切過甚。而於國內的軍事狀況反而較少注意，以是習焉不察，日軍之在此際突取攻勢，也未必不是覷定此一弱點而期望收穫攻其不備的效果。然則月餘以來，各個戰塲上的華軍，都曾有過若干新的收穫，以是此次湘北的勝利，也正是意中而非意外。自從五月的中條山血戰以後，國際局勢動盪益甚，日方在自顧不暇中，對華軍事行動頗見沉寂，但各綫華軍卻不斷從事出擊，而尤以東戰塲方面收穫爲最大。八月下旬浙閩贛皖的華軍全部出動，於二十七日攻克百官，猛攻蕭紹等地，並克復富陽餘杭武康；福建方面，則連克福清連江，更於九月三日收復東南重鎭的福州馬尾，九月十五日在鄂南又攻克通山。照日方的說法，大槪也許認爲這些據點都是日軍「完成目標以後的退出」，姑不論這些戰役經過都有詳明具體的報告，即以戰略意義而言，像通山福州這種地方，其得失決非等閒可比，即使退一步姑且承認眞是日軍的退出，則在事實上亦正無異於遭遇敗衂。至於九月初旬湘北大雲山之戰，當此度長沙戰事鏖戰正烈的時候，日方曾經表示那只是一種聲東擊西的策略，但華軍自經那次作戰獲勝之後，至今仍確保該山，形成對岳州的重大威脅，並爲此次大戰獲勝的前奏。從這些戰役的演進過程當中，可以確認華軍實力的不斷加强與增長，因此亦足見此次湘北大戰的勝利也絕非偶然。</p>
<p>縱觀五十個月以來的作戰經過，中國固然有重大的犧牲，其收穫也正未容輕視，而日方對中國作戰的目標，至今不只無一實現，而且往往適得其反。有如殲滅中國作戰主力，消除中國戰意，遏阻中國外援，切斷中國對外交通綫等等，都是日方所曾以全力從事的，其中究有那一項得到確切的成就？事實上即在已往華軍連遭敗績且國際綏靖政策盛行之際，日方也迄未能貫澈其理想；另一方面，隨著時日與國際大勢的演進，中國軍力已愈益加强，意志越發堅定，國際支援更腹突飛猛進，甚且遠超出中國自身所預期，後方的對外交通，也獲得了重大的發展和改進，距離著日本對華作戰的目標，無寗到愈趨愈遠。尤其是已假英美與蘇聯之間的隔膜，綏靖政策的遺緒，都隨著近一年來的國際大局演變而掃蕩凈盡，時至今日，中國與英美蘇聯已無異在駢肩作戰，而在民主國家的反侵略陣綫中，中國儼然又是舉足重輕的重鎭。其安定遠東的能力與作用，此後當隨著對日的演進與作戰勝利而益顯。這種種情態，大槪都是日方所不願予以正面直視而又無可如何的事實。</p>
<p>然而這一進展的趨勢固極可樂觀。警惕則不容稍懈，即以已往這許多收獲而言，亦皆爲艱辛奮力的結果，絕非偶然倖致。須知一方日本固仍在殫精竭慮以求挽回頹局，中國在不斷進步中，其在軍事政治或經濟各方面，也還有若干未能盡符理想之處，即如近來東戰塲與湘北的會戰，雖都獲致重大勝利，但尙不足語於全國主動反攻的發動，這固然是戰具方面的問題。同時亦可見仍有續加振奮努力的必要。以目前英國地位之堅强，邱吉爾九月三十日在議會的演說且以愼防被侵危險爲戒，這種安不忘危的態度，正是人們所當奉爲主臬的。</p>

<p>昨洋粉早晨開市尙稱平正、美坎各粉售價均與前收相接近、蓋在存底充實供求兩平之際、市面原無鉅大波折、惟本客實消零星去化迄未見衰、而投機客囤與皮球交易莫不趁平吸收、且在油米百物報漲之時、麵粉脚地堅固、尤爲做心思者垂靑、市面即在貿氣活潑中逐步上砌、惟獲利浮戶仍有同出、大戶客囤尙無問津、結果收市較前晚漲二三角、砲台自三十五元一角半開價、午後至叫角半、收市三十五元四角、金龍西棧上午三十三元　角、下午大至四角半、收市三十三元三角、東棧三十三元七八角、香蕉三十四元七角、綠寳三十四元六角半、飛剪三十二元半、後市亦在喊高中、小麥缺貨亦形緊俏　、</p>

<h3>金融　港申匯價鬆　期現金市都漲</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤暗市、期現金均見盤漲、因申匯私人常價不若上日之鬆賤、各方人心未免帶堅、現該滙價未能準時傳來、致使經營者不安、現金號與滙票商售出、兩次壓下至七千五百六十元、不久均爲祥興永·明豐·恒記·鼎盛等先後收吸、數次升至七千五百九十元、終軋升三十元、全日交易約三千數百兩、現金成交允稀、首由合盛進益大十兩、價升至九千三百元、計做高二十元、忽見大豐來出明豐四十兩、及成記出祥和六十兩、均九千二百九十元、大豐又出二十兩、祥興永出十兩、均順源買進、退至九千二百八十元、下午大豐出成記五十兩、爲九千三百元、比上日升二十元、當日高低亦二十元、成交不滿一百兩、金號本牌金、門市售價九千三百五十元、收進比售出低三百元、飾命仍平、</p>

<p>股票交易、成交A　內衣公司股五百股　價爲十二元七角半、</p>
<p>衆業股市大吿活躍、多種見新高價、各股上騰時、幾無反動可言、英聯股以四十三元開盤、開後直綫奔達四十六元半、橡皮股亦頗堅挺、</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布囤風甚熾　狂升一二元</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市續趨上騰、乃因人氣熱烈、屯風甚熾、惟實銷略形呆滯、蓋買存各布、尚須候船報裝、售盤白貨粗布漲每疋五角至一元、細布斜紋漲一元左右、漂染布開價參差亦漲一元之譜、本街成交各布五百餘件、粵港幇辦藍布色斜粗布等三百餘　、南洋幇洋幇辦粗布斜紋等一百數十件、今日有疋頭四二件運厦門、八百九十五件運香港、</p>
<p>東布　漲風續厲、取引所龍頭期布上下午連續升騰、在漲每疋一元七角至一元九角、蓋市上各雜牌細布現貨奇缺、等級比例相差過鉅、空戶見勢不佳、乃爭元抵補、新多又復加碼、故而直錢上升、迭創新價、現貨市塲之細布漲每疋一元半左右、龍頭新廠單已售開六十三元六角半、細斜存積愈枯、在升二元許、色貨四君子嗶嘰新單最高做開二元三角五分、收盤時二元三角四分七厘半、</p>

<h3>五金　新盤元續挫</h3>
<p>最近新盤元之市勢、因外埠客幫去化岑寂、而本街製釘廠因見其出產物本釘鉗路之淸閒、而對於原料品自然亦乏神採辦、故新盤元實銷受其打擊者殊夥、此外略有搜雜者、僅本街鉛絲廠螺絲廠而已、致實交已非昔比、而標準行情、亦見逐步下挫、刻市每擔喊沽二百五十元、而暗中二百四十七八元、亦有所成交、較之前市售盤已步降三五元不等、</p>

<h3>爲磋商供匯數額　各業代表赴港　滬中交兩行取消商匯率　出口匯票多未遵令結售</h3>
<p>據昨日所得可靠消息、平準會最近有電報到滬、知照特准經營外匯之各銀行、十月份結匯辦法、照原來規定各款辦理、並無變更、又宣佈、各業認爲有提出特殊問題之必要、該會甚願聽取並接受其意見、現悉除保險業疋頭業影片商代表、業已於數日來赴港外、此外準備推派代表南下者、有棉業汽車業烟草業、彼等此行、無非說明各業不能發展之困難情形、希望平準會能增加供給相當數字之外匯、同時、聞有若干美商會致電華盛頓、對平準會穩定幣制工作、表示擁護、對貿易所受限制、則希望予以援助、總之問題重心、又移至香港、一俟各業代表與平凖會美籍委員福克斯及其他委員會晤後、當可得一決定、</p>
<p>權衡輕重問題微細</p>
<p>有具名Dizzy之西僑談、頃聞有多數商人連袂赴港、與平準會有所磋商、此誠爲一種好消息、蓋在目前困難局勢中、或能覓獲若干實際辦法也、進口商現正遭遇若干重大困難、須知多數進口商人仍竭力維持其業務、並保留其必要之雇員、倘進口業不能繼續進行、應儘速使吾人知悉、俾實行裁員縮小營業範圍、此次赴港商人、似應請平凖會當局對於各正當商在八月二十日以前所定之貨物、與在此時期以後所定貨物、分別看待、而特准照優越匯率結匯、又英語言金融商業週報稱、消滅上海黑市、乃限制日本貿易政策之一部、事實上中外商業不免因此蒙受不利、但此僅偶然之事、無論何種限制政策、在實施時必不免引起困難、問題之癥結、在於何人受害最深耳、</p>
<p>日禁出口無甚要義</p>
<p>又該據論及日方當局、業已禁止任何出口貨物自上海運往自由中國問題稱、此項命令、在目前尚無重大意義、因滬港間貿易、固暢通如常、供給自由中國之物品、當然仍能經由香港運抵目的地也、惟就一般情形而言、流處自由中國之物品、略受阻碍而已、</p>
<p>結匯槪照平準匯率</p>
<p>財政部爲統一外匯管理機構起見、特公告取消英匯四辦士半美匯七元半之原定商業匯率、一律根據平凖基金委員會八月十八日所訂定之匯率掛牌、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、中國交通兩銀行業已遵照部令辦理、但中央銀行仍依法定匯率（英匯一先令二辦士半、美匯三十美元、）掛牌、所有進口貨之申請外匯曁出口貨之結售外匯、雖名稱上依照法定匯率計算、惟實際上因有平準會新匯率之存在、爲保障進出口商利益起見、特准領取法定匯率與平準率之差額、故其結果、無異直接按照平準　率計算、不過始終保持法定匯率、領取外匯差額之規定自屬必要、</p>
<p>出口匯票不得隱藏</p>
<p>平凖基金委員會規定凡商人自恃准或特許銀行取得平凖會之供給外匯者、應將所有出口匯票售與上項所指定銀行、如商人不遵此項規定、平凖會得予供給外匯、進出口商人作聯繫交易者、平凖會亦不予供給外匯、規定每一星期分別送平凖會港辦事處審核、自實施以來、第一二批已經核准供給外匯、因手續關係、每批大約需一星期以上、關於出口匯票售結與銀行、自由區域商人均已遵辦、惟上海出口商迄未照辦、平凖會決照旣定辦法予以取締、</p>
<h3>兩法輪進口　米煤到滬</h3>

<h3>採用一班辦公時間　英商集會考慮　銀行方面容有窒礙　工部局亦不致採用</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據今日（二日）向各方徵詢所悉、上海大多數美英商行、料將於今冬採取一班辦公時間、俾撙節此間之煤斤消耗、美商會旣已贊成此辦公時間之新變更、英商會與華僑聯合會亦步共後塵、於昨二日午後五時</p>
<p>集會考量</p>
<p>此事、討論結果、對於辦公時間之變更、將有重大影響、而可使猶豫不決之若干商行、亦決定改用一班辦公鐘點、記者頃請上海麥加利銀行經理兼外商銀行聯合會主席霍金斯披露外商銀行之態度、據答稱、對於此事、尚未決定、惟　信此種變更、不致有何差別、因各銀行業務</p>
<p>並不繁忙</p>
<p>也、另一英銀行家則稱、銀行若改變辦公時間、則顧客不能於午後持支票付現款、頗稱不便、此間多數銀行、均與世界各地分行有業務往來、隨時接獲電報、此須予以維持者、故辦公時間變更、將影響業務之辦理云、工部局發言人今晨聲稱、該局尚未研究一班辦公時間、而該局之重要部份、不致採用此法云、</p>
<h3>兩公司大菜間票價　增加一成</h3>

<h3>日滿鐵理事過美　所得印象</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日文大陸新報今日（二日）載稱、昨日（一日抵滬之美輪台羅總統號旅客中、有從歐美撤退之日人三十八人、南滿鐵道理事中西氏亦在其列、氏向日方新聞記者談稱、渠此次從葡京轉赴美國、勾留多日、附輪東返、所得印象爲美國大非昔比、現已成一大強國、故日人必須改變其對美國之見解、往時美國係與情領導政府、今則政府領導人民、茲者、若干日僑不得不棄其在開卷有益、勤多年所創之事業、遄赴本國、頗爲扼腕、</p>

<h3>台羅輪　昨晚南駛</h3>

<h3>當局對交易所房屋　有意另徵捐稅　營業特捐決定明年開徵　一律按估價徵百分之八</h3>
<p>據工部局發表、關於本局所擬開徵營業房屋特捐一案、業經提付特別諮詢委員兩度開會審議、結果該委員會對於本案、在原則上予以通過、但主張特捐之基本率應爲百分之八、並將原案所擬乙類之設立、予以取消、而以「乙」類所列證券·「金業·及物品交易所房屋、歸併「甲」類徵收特捐、</p>
<p>此種辦法</p>
<p>使本局歲收不過減少一萬三千元左右、該委員會大多數委員以爲與其將各該交易所房屋另設一類、開徵特捐、不如以他各方式向其征「稅」爲佳、至於「乙」類之設立、不妨稍遲實行、且在「新稅源委員會」所可建議他種稅收之時、易於公允決定究竟何種</p>
<p>特殊營業</p>
<p>應予列入此一分類、本局於本月一日舉行例會時、議決接受該委員會之意見、將「乙」類暫時廢除、此謂各種應予開征特捐之房屋、將一律按基本捐率百分之　付捐、因此本局決定自明年一月一日起、向各種用以經營圖利業務之房屋、包括辦公室·店舖·工廠·倉庫·以及碼頭等等、按其估價、每年征收特捐百分之八、又</p>

<h3>售票員推斃乘客案　法院判決全文　推斃身死部份殊堪認定　被告兇殘性成無可宥恕</h3>
<p>英商電車公司三五八號賣票員海門人王萬祥、於九月十三日在二十路無軌電車上、因揩油不遂、將乘客項東川由車上推下跌斃身死、經捕房將王拘解特三法院、捕房律師張天蔭依傷害致人死罪起訴、請求治以最高之刑、而此案發生之後、因賣票人員平時之態度、及其揩油之種種、在在均使乘客深留惡劣印象、此次竟因揩油不遂、膽敢將乘客推斃、致與伭譁然、嗣經承審推事石美瑜審訊明晰、判決王萬祥處無期徒刑、褫奪公權終身、各情已詳本報、茲石推事已將判決書製就、業於昨日分別送達、特將判決書內所列之判決主文、及判決理由摘錄於下、</p>
<p>（主文）王萬祥傷害致人於死、處無期徒刑、褫奪公權終身（事實從略）、</p>
<p>（理由）查已死項東川、左右脈胞紫青色、浮腫、鼻口腔流血、左肩部有表皮擦傷一處、腦後有深紅斑一處、約一圓銀幣大、係生前被推跌傷身死、業經本院檢察官督同法醫騐明、塡有騐斷書在卷、質之被告王萬祥、雖諉詞係死者自行跳車、否認有將其推下情事、第查該被告如何因圖</p>
<p>吞沒車資</p>
<p>與項東川發生爭執、如何惱羞成怒、將項東川用力推出車外、跌傷身死各情、已據在塲目覩之乘客蔣靖及許申金到案具結證明、經本院隔別訊問、核其證言、悉相吻合、毫無瑕疵可指、且該稅決定暫緩等、均係青年學生、與被告王萬祥素嫌隙、本其直接見聞、據實直陳、所供各節、旣與</p>
<p>事實相符</p>
<p>自足採爲鐵證、又據證人許申金供、當時伊與死者並立車門口、面均朝裏、背向外、死者被推時、急伸手抓住伊左臂、致伊連跌出車外等語、再參與檢察處騐斷書所載、死者致命傷係在腦部、足見項東川顯係被推朝天仰面跌下、與自行跳車跌死之辯解、自屬不能成立、至證人嚴德發、於出事時</p>
<p>並未在塲</p>
<p>目覩、突於本院庭訊時、自行到庭、以無據證言、對蔣靖之證言、漫加攻擊、自不足爲被告有利之證明、矧據該證人供、蔣靖打了二下鈴、項東川遂跌下云云、亦與王萬祥辯東川自己按鈴跳車等語、顯相歧異、其虛僞之供述、已不攻自破、綜上論斷、項東川係生前被王萬祥推下電車、跌傷後部身死</p>
<p>殊堪認定</p>
<p>雖無相當證據、足以證明其有殺人之故意、然律以傷害人致死之罪責、要無可辭、該被告兇殘性成、因吞沒車資未遂、將乘客推斃、匪特死者及其家屬蒙受其害、即一般不特定之乘客、亦莫不感有相當之危險、且該被告於破案後、一味狡展、毫無悛悔之念、是就其犯罪之動機·手段·及所生之損害·危險·曁犯罪後之態度而論、實</p>
<p>無可宥恕</p>
<p>非予盡法嚴懲、不足以資　戒、爰依刑事訴訟法第二百九十一條前段第二百九十二條·刑法一百七十七條第二項前段第五十七條·第三十七條·一項判決如主文、中華民國三十年九月二十六日、推事有美瑜、</p>

<p>春秋團圞佳節  霂長　　前些日子，我們曾「賞日」過，後天又逢中秋，不免再來一次「賞月」了。觀察日蝕，因爲三百年來所未有，極合於科學的研究。「賞月」則是詩人之致，雖然年年有，也是人生那得幾回逢，合於科學嗎？自然也頂頂不悖於邏輯的。君不見市上之大月餅乎，餅上就點綴着一隻大飛機，題曰：「乘機賞月」。　　這種閒情沙致，祇有上海灘應該有。人似乎特別健忘，會把飛機如此派用塲。不過我們似自嫦娥偷藥而奔月以來，便不曾將月亮忘記過。月餅在店家不可少，靠此有一年開銷；月餅在人家也決不嫌多，吾則也虛度一年甚至一生。　　我有斯口；就吃月餅；月餅爲口腹而生，月華也爲眼皮而供養。拚命地吃，看，看，吃。　　一面享樂，一而緊張，如果此地與那邊一對照，眞有無窮之感慨。「月有陰晴圓缺，人有悲歡離合，」月到中秋與吾，與吾人不大密切，悲歡離合的現實，才是人生面對的一切。爲戰爭而顚沛流離，家人散失，天各一方，這些何止恒河沙數；乘飛機游月宮倒眞是現代唐明皇們的甜蜜之夢。　　好罷，一班腰纏十萬貫的人自有其不甘寂寞的必要，要他少吃三塊錢一隻的月餅，的確是苛求，但看看悲歡離合的現實則請少糜費些也不寃枉。爲自已，也得爲別人，日後自見分曉。全家都在西風裹，九月衣裳未剪裁，在孤島上，苦事終還未缺如，賞心樂事之餘，不知尙動絲毫惻隱之心吾？　　本市節的運動會籲請同胞踴躍推進寒衣運動，三敎道義會也求各界節省秋節糜費，救濟隱貧及街頭難胞，……大概不致全部落了空的。我想。生活圖裡我是彈性女兒  秋霞　　「都會裏燃着狂歡」火　，熱情飛躍在脚尖。……看！每副笑臉，都含着悲哀，看！每副笑臉，都含着辛酸。在重重的壓迫下，依舊要花言巧語……」這一曲歌，確已把我的生活，赤裸裸地寫出來了　　淸晨，我拖了疲乏的身體，跨出吃人的迷宮－舞場。回到家中，那是個够陰沉潮濕的灶披問，這時，媽已悄悄地起身爲我準備好點心了。脫去大衣，旗袍，皮鞋，絲襪，換上了樸紫的布衣衫。略略進些稀飯，便倒在媽讓出的舖板上睡了，硬硬的鋪板，固比不上沙發的柔和舒適，但這裏的空氣是自由的。我終於呼呼地酣睡了。　　一覺醒來，已是午後二時，連忙起身，梳洗，進餐，化裝，花去了整整三小時。對鏡自顧，我又變成個濃裝艶抹的女人了，我深恨這種妖形怪狀的模樣，但是理智吿訴我，「爲了生活，忍耐些罷！一於是，我輕輕地拭去眼角的淚痕，提起皮夾，預備出鬥。媽低聲道：一阿媛！房東太太父來過了，煤球也將用盡，你想點法子。」我一按皮夾，不禁悽然，一陣心酸，自心田湧至鼻尖　　幽揚的樂聲，有節奏地交響着。靡靡的歌聲，在空氣中播盪。粉香，酒氣，刺激着每個人的嗅覺。一對對的男女，旋轉在舞池中，偎着臉，依着頭，一方固是尋歡作樂，但另一方的內心痛苦，有誰知道呢？我坐在一角，担憂着昨天吃湯糰」的命運再降到今天來，同時，出門時媽的可嚀，又在耳畔顫抖了。　　樂聲又起，一個肥頭胖腦的像伙，站到我的面前：臉橫肉在冷笑，兩顆鼠眼在逼視。我　起日前與他起舞時的摸手摸腳，不禁不寒而慄。但，爲了生活、我只得含笑起迎，給他擁抱着轉入舞池了。一曲舞罷，他把一卷紙納入我的手中，舞票外　還　着十元票五張。我想還他，可是念及他的錢原是囤積操縱在我們頭上刮天時，我毫不躊躇地接了。至少，房金與煤球有着落了　　何年何月，爸爸找到職業，我可跳出這生活圈了？　　掌故譚不算幽默  漁光達　　活葉文選　　數學敎師：一爲什麽你把這本好好的代數一葉一葉的撕下來？」　　學生：「因爲牠太重不好拿，所　我要把牠變成一本代數活葉文選。」　　答非所問　　甲：「你家裹那一種書最多？」　　乙：「電影說明書。」狸案人物志  柳塘　　五　李國舅　　仁宗每念李妃，不及享天下養，故深罔極之思，因遇李氏特厚，乃以其長女（即周陳國大公主）配用和之子瑋。瑋樸陋，與主積不相能。主嘗中夜扣皇城門入訴於帝，瑋坐是貶官，其後終不睦，主常處宮中，及主卒，以瑋奉主無狀，又貶陳州。　　嘗見包公案中有　美案，謂有陳世美停妻尙主，爲包拯所誅，查自太祖至徽宗所生八十主，尙主之駙馬，未兒有陳姓者，除李瑋與陳國大公主不睦之外，絕無與小說所言相類似之事實。　　爲劉后寵遇最厚者爲張耆，因嘗寓其家，耆事后唯謹，所以報之也。及劉后預政，賜第凡七百楹，安佚富盛踰四十年。有子二十四人，俱以「一」爲名，如得　，可一，利一，希一。家中爲曲闌，積白貨其中，與羣婢相貿易，婢有病，親爲診切，以藥償之。家庭開商店，自相買賣欲　不外出，利不外溢，可謂盤剝入微矣。食量增大  呂景朗　　甲：我的食量愈來愈大了　　乙：何以見得？　　甲：以前吃六隻饅頭已經很够飽了，現在吃十二隻還是不飽。　　乙：老兄，並非你食量增大，倒是饅頭變小的緣故。秋海棠  秦瘦歐　　十二　意外風波　　　他還沒有「不過」下去，孟家的兒媳已再也不能忍耐了。　　「好了，吳伯伯！這裏樟樹屯一帶，誰也不知道你是一個好人，祇要你想得出是誰作弄林生的，定去說一句話，人還會不跟着你回來嗎？」　　她這樣一說，秋海棠便祗能跟着孟老掌櫃的一起打哈哈了。　　雙方後來又談了許多的話，孟老掌櫃的却始終用軟功，連秋海棠想拿出五十塊錢來給他，作爲梅寳回家的旅費，他也死命的拒絕不受。儘說：　　「這都是尙老二的不是，怎樣還能教你化錢。」　　在過度興奮的情緒下，秋海棠竟掙扎着從坑上爬了下來，親自送孟家翁媳倆走出去。　　「如今是好了！」張老穴幫秋海棠關上了大門，差一些拍手笑出來。「趙二爺的計策眞敎人佩服！要是不把他們的林生搶去做押頭，咱們的姑娘怎麼能回來呢？」（二二七）（第十二章完）</p>

<h3>Great Victory of the Chinese Army's Counteroffensive in Northern Hunan; Japanese Army Retreats on Three Routes; Chinese Forces Intercept Between the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers; Heavy Casualties Suffered by Japanese Troops in Dongyang, Yong'an, and Other Areas</h3>
<p>Changsha – The main force of the Japanese army, numbering over 100,000, which was besieged by the Chinese army in areas such as Dongyang City, Yong'an City, and Huanghua City between the Liuyang River and the Laodao River, suffered heavy casualties after several days of fierce attacks by the Chinese army. Exhausted of ammunition and provisions, the entire front wavered, and they began to flee north in three routes around 2 AM on the 2nd. The Chinese army is currently pursuing them vigorously and has established a strong interception between the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers. The spoils of war from this battle are numerous and are currently being tallied. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Although it is currently impossible to report the exact war results obtained by the Chinese army in the major battle in Northern Hunan, it is certain that this campaign has come to an end. The initial assessment here was that approximately 80,000 Japanese troops were fighting on the front lines. However, lacking both ammunition and provisions and unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Chinese army, they retreated north this morning along their original advance routes, namely Chunhua Mountain, Fulinpu, and the railway line, in three routes. During the retreat, before crossing the Xinqiang River, they were ambushed everywhere by the Chinese army. (2nd Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese military news: The Chinese army in Northern Hunan has achieved a great victory in its counteroffensive. The Japanese army on the south bank of the Miluo River is in full retreat, fleeing north along the entire line. Various units of the Chinese army are currently pursuing and annihilating the enemy within the encirclement, with the force of a wind sweeping away fallen leaves. Huanghua City, Yong'an City, and other places along the Changsha-Liuyang line have been recovered. Corpses are piled up like mountains in the Laodao River area. Strongholds from Jinjing to Chunhua Mountain have also been recovered. The military authorities here believe that although the Japanese army is currently desperately trying to break through and retreat towards Yueyang, most of the strongholds on both banks of the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers are controlled by the Chinese field army. Whether the Japanese troops retreating north from Changsha can escape the Chinese army's heavy encirclement is still questionable. News from the front this morning stated that there are no traces of the Japanese army around Changsha. According to Japanese prisoners, the most valiant Japanese Third and Fourth Divisions were met with a crushing blow by the Chinese army in the Northern Hunan campaign, and their divisional commanders were killed. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha – The Japanese troops driven by the Chinese army to the Laodao and Liuyang River areas east of Changsha have suffered even greater casualties after being surrounded and attacked on all sides by the Chinese army. The Japanese army's morale is currently wavering, and they appear to be attempting a breakout towards the northeast. The sound of artillery fire northeast of Changsha is moving from near to far. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha – The major battle in Northern Hunan reached a decisive stage on the afternoon of the 1st. The entire Japanese force of approximately five divisions that crossed the Miluo River and invaded the south was gradually drawn into a pre-set trap by the Chinese army. Then, various units of the Chinese army cooperated from all sides, heavily encircling the Japanese troops in the Laodao River and Liuyang River areas northeast of Changsha and launching a fierce encirclement attack on the Japanese army. A magnificent and unparalleled annihilation battle commenced at 3 PM on the 30th. The Japanese army, running out of food and ammunition, initially put up a desperate struggle. The Chinese army soldiers were determined to annihilate the Japanese army, charging bravely and engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. By the afternoon of the 1st, corpses were scattered throughout the riverbanks and valleys. The Japanese army's momentum has now been thwarted, and the entire front is wavering, having begun to break out and flee north. The Chinese army is currently intercepting them. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha – A contingent of over 3,000 Japanese troops, accompanied by more than 30 tanks, besieged by the Chinese army in the northeastern part of Changsha, attempted to break through and escape on the 30th but was intercepted and killed by the Chinese army. Twenty-two of their tanks were destroyed, and the remaining troops scattered and fled. The Chinese army has dispatched teams to search and annihilate them. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha – A unit of the Japanese army, besieged by the Chinese army in the Laodao River and Liuyang River areas surrounding Changsha, stealthily attacked the northeastern gate of Changsha around 1 PM on the 30th but was fiercely intercepted by the Chinese army and completely annihilated. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Hunan – The Chinese army engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the northeastern part of Changsha today, destroying 22 Japanese tanks and 100 armored vehicles, killing numerous Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army's supply line has already been cut off by the Chinese army. Running out of ammunition and provisions, the entire Japanese front has shown signs of wavering today, and the Chinese army is currently conducting a fierce encirclement and annihilation operation. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Hunan – On the evening of the 29th, the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese troops invading the Lulin Tan and Fangmi Ju areas, killing over 400 Japanese soldiers. Scattered Japanese troops boarded ships and fled, and the Chinese artillery bombarded them. Thirteen Japanese motorboats and small steamers were hit and sank into the river, and the Japanese troops on board were buried in the bellies of fish. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde – The Japanese troops invading Hengling Lake and Jiagang Zui have been completely wiped out after days of bloody fighting by the Chinese army. Japanese warships have also fled north in disarray. There are currently no traces of the Japanese army in that area. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Hunan – The battle situation surrounding Changsha is focused on the Huanghua City and Yong'an City areas. The Japanese army, having been continuously besieged by the Chinese army, is extremely panicked and appears to be concentrating all its forces to break through a point in the Chinese army's encirclement and retreat. The Chinese army has narrowed the encirclement and occupied and controlled all the ferries and boats on the Laodao and Liuyang Rivers, aiming to annihilate the Japanese army completely. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Hunan – The Japanese troops in the Huanghua City, Yong'an City, and Chunhua Mountain areas east of Changsha have suffered further significant losses after being surrounded and attacked on all sides by the Chinese army. The Chinese army has formed a siege between the Laodao and Liuyang Rivers, narrowing the encirclement and launching a fierce assault on the Japanese army. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Eastern Jiangxi – Over a thousand Japanese troops crossed the Chuxi Ferry northeast of Nanchang on the 28th, launching two attacks on the Chinese army. The Chinese army, taking advantage of favorable terrain, held their ground against the Japanese army, engaging in multiple hand-to-hand combats, and ultimately defeated the invading Japanese troops, killing many Japanese soldiers, including two commanders. The Chinese army also captured many spoils of war. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Spokesman Discusses Strategic Observations on the Northern Hunan Campaign</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A reporter visited the military spokesman on the evening of the 1st to inquire about his strategic observations on the Northern Hunan campaign. The spokesman replied as follows: Judging from the troop strength and unit designations used by the Japanese in this invasion, their total troop strength has reached 130,000 men. The unit designations are the 3rd, 4th, 6th, 13th, 33rd, and 40th Divisions, and the Independent 14th Brigade, etc., mostly active-duty units of their country. They account for one-fourth of the total number of privately trafficked troops in their country, comprising all of their most elite units on the various battlefields in China. China's operational plan and determination against this Japanese army are to lure the Japanese deep into favorable areas and then encircle and annihilate them. The morale of the people in Hunan has always been high. The units engaging the Japanese army in that area are mostly elite troops of the National Army, so both the morale of the troops and the morale of the people are extremely high. The degree of cooperation between the military and the people has also reached its peak. In the past half month of arduous fighting, the Japanese army has surely tasted the heroic combat of our people and recognized the strong killing power of the National Army. Although the battle is not yet over, it can be predicted that the result of this battle, even if it cannot annihilate the entire Japanese army, will certainly inflict unprecedented punishment on them. This is not only a pivotal point in the transition of victory and defeat in the Sino-Japanese War but also an opportunity to stabilize the overall situation in the Far East and guarantee world peace. Because the Japanese army has long been outwardly strong but inwardly weak after four years of attrition by our war, their recent opportunistic maneuvers in the international arena, after suffering this blow, have completely exposed their weaknesses. It is believed that no one in the world will be deceived by them again. There is no doubt that China will win the war. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Have Attacked Changsha Three Times, But Have Never Occupied It</h3>
<p>Chongqing – All Chinese newspapers today published articles commenting on the victory of the Chinese army in the Battle of Changsha, unanimously stating that this battle dealt a serious blow to the Japanese army, both spiritually and militarily. This is indeed a turning point in the Sino-Japanese War. The newspapers today published many interesting "inside stories" of the Battle of Changsha. Chinese authorities here stated that the Japanese army had attacked Changsha three times but had never actually occupied it. On the evening of September 27, 200 Japanese soldiers disguised as civilians and paratroopers infiltrated Changsha City through the northeast gate but were wiped out by the Chinese army within 24 hours. On the 30th, several hundred more Japanese soldiers disguised as civilians infiltrated the city through the east gate, setting fires in various locations in an attempt to disrupt the Chinese army's rear. At the same time, the Japanese army fiercely bombarded the city, resulting in much of the city being razed to the ground. However, this civilian team was again annihilated by the Chinese army. Yesterday, a detachment of Japanese cavalry rushed to the south gate of Changsha but was repelled by the Chinese army and failed to enter the city. The great victory of the Chinese army this time relied on the calm command of General Xue Yue, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Army on the Hunan Front, and the close coordination of the Chinese armies on the neighboring front lines. According to people from all walks of life in China, General Xue had predetermined the strategy before the Japanese army launched its attack and then proceeded accordingly, calmly and unhurriedly. During the battle, he did not leave his headquarters, which was only two miles from Changsha. His troops completely followed his orders. When the Japanese army crossed the Xinqiang River, the general ordered the troops guarding the Xinqiang River and the Miluo River to move to the flanks and rear of the Japanese army. In the initial stages of the battle, he only slightly engaged the Japanese army, ordering his troops to hold the Laodao River line and fiercely defend against the Japanese army's attacks. At the same time, the large army deployed to the flanks and rear of the Japanese army engaged in encircling the Japanese army from behind. The strength of the Japanese army in this attack was estimated to be approximately 150,000 men. The general feared that the strength of the Hunan Front's garrison was insufficient to carry out an annihilation battle, so he requested the Chinese armies in neighboring war zones to participate in the counteroffensive. The general offensive began at 3 PM on September 30 and lasted for 48 hours. The Chinese army fought more and more bravely, finally repelling the Japanese army yesterday afternoon. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, the Japanese army decided to make a general retreat to the north. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Gains of China's War Effort</h3>
<p>In yesterday's edition, this newspaper commented on the war situation in Northern Hunan, stating that the Japanese army's offensive was gradually reaching its limit and had fallen into an encirclement, predicting that their retreat would not be far off. However, the actual development of events has been even faster than our envisioned imaginings. Since the afternoon of September 30, the Chinese army has launched a fierce encirclement attack on the surrounded Japanese army, which has broken through and retreated towards Yuezhou. As expected, the Japanese authorities have stated that the Japanese army began to "shift its front" from Changsha and its vicinity yesterday, "returning to its original posture," with the reason naturally being that "the operational objectives have already been achieved." What the Japanese army's operational objectives actually are, we outsiders cannot know in detail, but judging from the statements made by the Japanese authorities at the beginning of this campaign, it seems that their objectives are far from being achievable by such hasty advances and retreats. According to the genius theorist of war philosophy, Clausewitz, the purpose of war is to disarm a country and eliminate its possibility of resistance. In order to achieve this purpose, it is necessary to destroy the enemy's military force, occupy its territory, and destroy its will. Which of the aforementioned tasks did the Japanese army's actions in Northern Hunan actually accomplish? This is something that the Japanese side needs to explain specifically. Now, China's territory in Northern Hunan is unharmed, its military force is intact, and its will is even more vigorously developing. This is sufficient to prove that the Chinese side's claim that all of these developments are the result of the predetermined strategic development is indeed an unshakable truth.</p>
<p>In fact, the increased strength of China's war effort is not limited to the Battle of Northern Hunan alone. However, recently, the Chinese people have often been overly concerned about various developments on the international front and have paid less attention to the domestic military situation. As a result, they have become accustomed to not noticing this. It is possible that the Japanese army's sudden offensive at this time was aimed at exploiting this weakness and hoping to achieve the effect of catching us off guard. However, in the past month or so, the Chinese armies on various battlefields have all made some new gains. Therefore, the victory in Northern Hunan this time was expected rather than unexpected. Since the bloody battle of Zhongtiaoshan in May, the international situation has become even more turbulent, and the Japanese side, preoccupied with its own affairs, has been relatively quiet in its military actions against China. However, the Chinese armies on various lines have been continuously engaging in attacks, with the greatest gains being made on the eastern battlefield. In late August, the Chinese armies in Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui all mobilized, capturing Baiguan on the 27th, launching fierce attacks on Xiaoshao and other places, and recovering Fuyang, Yuhang, and Wukang. On the Fujian front, Fuching and Lianjiang were captured one after the other, and the important southeastern town of Fuzhou Mawei was recovered on September 3. On September 15, Tongshan was captured in southern Hubei. According to the Japanese side, they may perhaps believe that these strongholds were all "withdrawn after the objectives were achieved." Regardless of the detailed and specific reports of these battles, even in terms of strategic significance, the gain or loss of places like Tongshan and Fuzhou is by no means a trivial matter. Even if we take a step back and temporarily acknowledge that it is indeed the Japanese army's withdrawal, in fact, it is no different from suffering a defeat. As for the Battle of Dayun Mountain in Northern Hunan in early September, when the fierce battle in Changsha was raging, the Japanese side once stated that it was just a feint to the east while attacking in the west. However, since the Chinese army won that battle, it has maintained control of that mountain, posing a significant threat to Yuezhou and serving as a prelude to the victory in this major battle. From the evolution of these battles, it can be confirmed that the strength of the Chinese army is constantly strengthening and growing. Therefore, it can also be seen that the victory in the Battle of Northern Hunan this time was by no means accidental.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past fifty months of warfare, China has certainly made significant sacrifices, but its gains should not be underestimated. The Japanese side's objectives in the war against China have not only failed to be achieved, but have often been counterproductive. For example, annihilating China's main war force, eliminating China's will to fight, preventing China's foreign aid, and cutting off China's foreign transportation lines are all things that the Japanese side has done its best to achieve. Which of these has achieved definite success? In fact, even when the Chinese army suffered repeated defeats in the past and the policy of international appeasement was prevalent, the Japanese side was still unable to realize its ideals. On the other hand, with the passage of time and the evolution of the international situation, China's military strength has become increasingly stronger, its will has become more firm, and international support has developed by leaps and bounds, even exceeding China's own expectations. The rear's foreign transportation has also achieved significant development and improvement, and the distance to Japan's war objectives against China has become farther and farther. In particular, the past gaps between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the legacy of the policy of appeasement, have all been swept away with the evolution of the international situation in the past year. Today, China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are no different from fighting shoulder to shoulder, and China is also a major power in the anti-aggression front of democratic countries. Its ability and role in stabilizing the Far East will become increasingly apparent with the evolution of the war against Japan and the victory in the war. All of these situations are probably facts that the Japanese side is unwilling to face directly but cannot do anything about.</p>
<p>However, this trend of progress is very encouraging. Vigilance cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Even with regard to the many gains we have made in the past, they are all the result of arduous struggle and are by no means accidental. It must be known that the Japanese side is still racking its brains to try to reverse the decline. While China is constantly making progress, there are still some areas, whether in military, political, or economic terms, that have not fully met our ideals. For example, although the recent battles on the eastern battlefield and in Northern Hunan have both achieved significant victories, they are still not sufficient to speak of launching a nationwide initiative for a counteroffensive. This is certainly a matter of weaponry, but it also shows that there is still a need to continue to inspire and strive. Given the strength of Britain's current position, Churchill's speech in Parliament on September 30 still warned against the danger of being invaded. This attitude of not forgetting danger in times of peace is precisely what people should regard as their guiding principle.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Flee Across the River at Baimiao; Chinese Army Recovers Qingyuan; Chinese Army in the West River Continues to Recapture Strongholds; Japanese Troops Retreat in Disarray Towards Xinhui</h3>
<p>Yingde – The Japanese troops invading the northeast of Qingyuan were blocked by the Chinese army in the vicinity of the Baimiao area of Damiao Mountain. On the evening of the 29th, hearing that the Chinese army's reinforcements had arrived, the Japanese troops fled across the river that night. The Chinese army recovered Qingyuan City on the morning of the 30th, killing over 200 scattered and bewildered Japanese soldiers and capturing a large number of spoils of war.

<h3>Geomagnetic Observatory of the Academia Sinica Observes the Impact of the Solar Eclipse on Geomagnetism; Excellent Results Obtained</h3>
<p>Chongyang – The Geomagnetic Observatory of the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica came to the southeast this time to observe the total eclipse on September 21. It was responsible for observing the impact of the solar eclipse on geomagnetism. Because it was not hindered by the weather, it obtained excellent results. According to the observation results, the strength of the horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic field weakened during the total solar eclipse, the amplitude increased, and the declination and inclination also changed significantly. This phenomenon is because the radiation emitted by the sun at that time was blocked by the moon, and the current in the high-altitude ionosphere of the Earth's magnetic field weakened accordingly. This is a powerful proof of the ultraviolet light theory. According to the Geomagnetic Observatory of the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica, it is the only organization in China that studies geomagnetism. The working location this time was in the wilderness four kilometers away from the city of Chong'an. A temporary geomagnetic station was specially built, constructed entirely of non-magnetic materials. There are no traces of iron within a radius of about 400 meters around the station, so the observations are very accurate. The institute has now decided to cooperate with the Meteorological Bureau to continue measuring the geomagnetic elements of Fujian Province. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Three-Power Conference Successfully Concludes, Resolution to Jointly Establish Peace</h3>
<p>US and Britain Gain Raw Materials to Increase Production; Assist the Soviet Union in Resisting Germany to Strive for Final Victory</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 2nd – The Three-Power Conference has successfully concluded. At the close, the conference stated that it is determined to adhere to the resolution of the three governments, namely, to jointly establish peace after the elimination of Nazism, so that the people of all countries can live peacefully in their territories without fear of need and want.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 2nd – The Three-Power Conference held in Moscow on September 29th successfully concluded on October 1st. The representatives of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States were inspired and encouraged by the importance and transcendence of their mission. What was their important mission? To assist the Soviet Union in resisting Germany, to strive to restore the independence and freedom of the countries conquered by the Fascist Party, and to save all nations from the Nazi threat. During this conference, Stalin also personally participated, completed several discussions, and, based on the goals of the conference, passed important resolutions. The results of the conference showed that the three powers are completely united and striving together for victory against the common enemy of mankind. This conference was convened in response to telegrams from President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill to Stalin. As the telegrams stated, the purpose of convening this conference was to determine the following issues: (1) How can the Soviet Union be given the greatest assistance? (2) The distribution of common resources. (3) The best way to utilize common resources.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 2nd – The leaders of the British and American delegations, Beaverbrook and Harriman, issued a joint statement here yesterday at the close of the tripartite conference, stating that Britain and the United States will provide the Soviet Union with all the necessities it has requested. A communique issued by the Soviet government stated that the tripartite conference was held in an atmosphere of complete mutual understanding, trust, and goodwill, and has now successfully completed its work. The completion of the discussions was two months earlier than scheduled. Stalin's sharp and practical mentality was an important factor in the conference. He was familiar with all the details and possibilities, and all participants were impressed. According to Reuters reporters, the tripartite conference has set a new record for conducting business. The six committees studying the various needs of the Soviet army completed their work in only two days. The tripartite conference held a plenary session yesterday afternoon. These rapid developments can confirm the general view that thorough preparation had been made before the talks. The British military and economic missions here have made valuable contributions to this point. All discussions in the conference were rapid, thorough, and effective. Perhaps no other conference in recent years has achieved such great results in such a short period of time. When Soviet spokesman Lozovsky described the conference, he emphatically stated the importance the Soviets attached to the conference and the satisfactory impression of the results of the conference. After the plenary session, the Soviet side hosted the participating representatives in the Kremlin.</p>
<h3>Full Text of Speech by Soviet Representative</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Moscow, 2nd – The full text of the speech by Molotov, Chairman of the Soviet delegation at the Three-Power Conference, is as follows: "Sir Beaverbrook, Mr. Harriman, and gentlemen of the various delegations, in a few days, this conference has successfully completed its work and unanimously passed resolutions on various issues. In this regard, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, I would like to thank the British and American delegations and experts, and especially Sir Beaverbrook and Mr. Harriman, for promoting the success of this conference. Comrade Stalin has also enthusiastically participated in the various tasks completed by the conference. The decisive interests of our great freedom-loving nation have enabled us to cooperate closely and unanimously wage a historic struggle against the Hitlerite bandits who specialize in enslaving other countries. In this regard, we have fully understood this in the past few days. This conference was initiated by modern great statesmen President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill. We would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill. As is generally known, the purpose of convening this conference is to provide material aid to the Soviet Union and jointly defeat Hitlerism. In this regard, we should note that not only Britain, which is currently at war, but also the United States, which is not at war, has clearly understood the importance of eliminating Hitlerism and assisting the Soviet Union to achieve this goal. No matter how the enemy exaggerates its temporary achievements, the joint efforts of the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States have predetermined our final victory. Judging from the resolutions of this conference, it can be seen that material aid to the Soviet Union will be more frequent and expanded in the future, and the shipment of aircraft and tanks to the Soviet Union will also increase day by day. Hitler's calculations have been completely wrong. Hitler has prompted the democratic countries to unite and fight against Nazi hegemony. This is completely unexpected by Hitler. This point is particularly important, because Nazism has not only enslaved several countries, but has also become a serious threat to the countries that are about to be attacked by Germany. At this conference, the British and American representatives were extremely consistent and rapid in resolving the issue of aiding the Soviet Union. Therefore, we can see that the friendly countries have understood that the Soviet Union is indeed shouldering the most important responsibility for fighting against fascism. At the same time, we deeply know that this kind of assistance must be implemented quickly and must be strengthened according to the needs of the war. No matter how the Hitler aggressors intensify the looting of their own people and the conquered countries (including France, which has been ravaged for a year, and Bulgaria, which has been transformed into a base for attacking the Soviet Union), Hitler's plan will still become a bubble. The looting by the Hitler aggressors cannot be compared with the great strength of the three powers that are destroying the cruel Hitlerism. Hitler is the culprit in killing all mankind. In this glorious struggle aimed at defeating Hitler, this conference will occupy an important page. Our hatred for Hitler and Goering and the hope for their failure are of no help. We must eliminate the power of this common enemy of mankind anytime, anywhere, and forever. In order to achieve this goal, we must crush their attempts one by one. The free countries led by the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States have understood the importance of crushing Nazi attempts. This is the political characteristic of this conference. The arrogant Hitler has never encountered such a huge united force. Our great anti-Hitler front will rapidly strengthen, and no force can destroy this front. At the same time, with the establishment of a large alliance of countries, various methods can be found to eliminate the Nazi cancer in Europe and the threat it poses to all freedom-loving nations. It is unfortunate that the Soviet Union has encountered the heaviest blow from the Hitler aggressors. However, our arduous struggle has been recognized by people all over the world. In this regard, we have understood it. Under the guidance of the great leader Comrade Stalin, the Soviet Union has carried out the task of liberation. Its purpose is not only to liberate the people of all of Europe, but also to strive for freedom for the whole world. In this regard, the world will definitely evaluate it, and it is also deeply understood by the representatives of the friendly countries that are assisting the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has encountered attacks from the cruel Hitler Party in more than one place. In this struggle, we have made great sacrifices. Although, our will has never wavered, and it will inevitably become stronger because of this. Although our country's war against fascism is extremely difficult, our army has become a formidable force that can definitely defend the country and the people. Our country's struggle against Hitler's Germany has won the approval of the people of all countries, because they have confirmed that the Soviet Union is fighting for the freedom and independence of all countries. For this reason, the sympathy and assistance of freedom-loving countries to our country has been rapidly increasing. I hereby, on behalf of the Soviet government and the people of the Soviet Union, make a guarantee to the British and American representatives: "Our will to oppose Hitler's Germany cannot be subdued by any force, and our confidence in obtaining victory over the common enemy of mankind is unshakable."</p>
<h3>Contents of American Representative's Speech</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 2nd – At the powerful conference on October 1st, Harriman, representing the United States, and Beaverbrook, spoke as follows: The conference of representatives of the three countries of the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States has come to an end. The purpose of the representatives coming here is to examine the issue of supplies from Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union during the course of the Soviet Union's war against the Axis countries. The conference was chaired by the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and began discussions on Monday. With regard to the conference's review of the issue of the Soviet Union's existing resources and the output of Britain and the United States, it has been decided to supply all the necessities required by the Soviet Union's military and political authorities. On the other hand, the Soviet government will supply the two countries with the raw materials urgently needed by Britain and the United States. The transportation issue has also been reviewed, and a plan has been drafted by the conference to expand transportation routes in all aspects. Stalin has authorized myself and Lord Beaverbrook to express our gratitude for the various forms of assistance from Britain and the United States. This assistance is very extensive and will definitely strengthen the Soviet Union's defense and assist the Red Army in counterattacking the aggressors. I hereby, on behalf of my country's government and Lord Beaverbrook, certify that Britain and the United States have obtained sufficient raw materials from the Soviet government. These raw materials will definitely increase our country's military output. The spirit of this conference was extremely harmonious. Therefore, the conference has successfully concluded in a short period of time. We must also solemnly state Stalin's sympathetic cooperation and understanding in the conference. At the same time, we are deeply grateful for the efforts of Molotov and other Soviet representatives.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – Although early winter snow has fallen on both the northern and southern ends of the Soviet Union, the German army still appears to be intensifying its offensives in Leningrad and Ukraine. Recent Soviet communiqués only stated that on the evening of October 1, Soviet troops continued to engage in fierce battles with the enemy along the entire front. After snowfall in the area of Leningrad, there have been reports that Germany is rushing reinforcements. Soviet troops have launched vigorous counterattacks to the east of the city, with considerable success. According to a commander of the Baltic Fleet, Soviet ships are now giving the German army not a moment of peace. Our resistance is growing stronger day by day, and our troops are also increasing day by day. There is no new news today regarding the counteroffensive by General Timoshenko's forces in the central region. However, in Ukraine, it is reported that the German army has used gliders for the first time. According to dispatches from Moscow last night, the Black Sea Fleet has shot down several gliders. In the Crimea, fierce battles continue on the isthmus leading to the peninsula.</p>
<h3>Red Army in Leningrad Breaks Through Enemy Lines in Four Places; German Army Makes Little Progress in Crimea; Finnish Army Reportedly Occupies Capital of Karelia</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 2nd – A correspondent in the Swedish capital of Dagens Nyheter reports that Soviet troops in Leningrad have broken through the German lines surrounding the city in four places and have completely repulsed the right wing of General Liep's forces. It is reported that Soviet troops have attacked the German army along a 30-mile front from Koropino to Schlisselburg across the Neva River. Koropino is 20 miles southeast of Leningrad, and Schlisselburg is on the shore of Lake Ladoga.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 2nd – When answering questions from reporters today, Lord Beaverbrook said that the Soviet people are indeed very happy. I do not want to over-flatter their attitude, but they have indeed understood our problems. He and the chief American representative Harriman both said that they had brought personal letters from British Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt to Stalin, and that the findings of the various committees would be compiled into a final report. Harriman said that Stalin's work had great speed, accuracy, and realism, and was full of patience. He emphasized that all delegations were able to recognize the need for speed, and he hoped that the conference could be shortened even further. The speed at which materials were delivered to the Soviet Union could be seen in the speed of this conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – German attempts to capture Odessa have so far failed. It is now reported that the German army has used giant aircraft to tow gliders, carrying troops to attempt to recapture Odessa, as was done in Crete. However, the Soviet side said that some of these troop-carrying aircraft have been shot down. In the northern sector, a Soviet officer wrote in the Red Star newspaper that it is estimated that 100,000 German soldiers have been killed or wounded in the two sectors of the Leningrad battlefield, and 400 tanks and over 800 aircraft have been lost. The German blitzkrieg against Leningrad has ended in a miserable defeat, but the city is still in serious danger and a terrible battle will take place. In Ukraine, the German army, advancing from Poltava, is probing the Kharkov industrial area and is believed to have made some progress. In the Crimea, in the great battle on the twelve-mile-wide isthmus, the German army appears to have advanced to within seven miles south of Perekop. The German side claims that German aircraft have again bombed Moscow, but the Soviet side only reports that in the past few months, German aircraft attempting to attack Moscow have lost 170 aircraft. Recent Soviet communiqués still state that Soviet troops engaged the enemy along the entire front yesterday, and that 26 enemy aircraft were destroyed on September 29 and 9 Soviet aircraft were lost. On September 30, a German reconnaissance aircraft was shot down near Moscow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd – Reports from Finland state that Soviet troops, who launched a fierce attack near Leningrad yesterday, have occupied a town in the suburbs. It is estimated that one million Soviet troops are surrounded in Leningrad, with a large number of tanks and artillery. After a fierce bombardment by Soviet artillery on Monday night, Soviet armored divisions attempted to break through the German lines to the east of the city, but were hindered by newly laid minefields by the German army. At the same time, Soviet troops attacked in other areas to prevent the German army from advancing. Finnish sources only mentioned their already announced victories and said that they had cut off the connection between the Murmansk and Syvr rivers, leaving only two poor roads still available to supply Soviet troops in the northern sector. Messages from Berlin stated the difficulties of German transportation, but said that these difficulties have now been overcome. It also said that it will now be necessary to engage in a winter war in the Soviet Union, but that the German side has already made special preparations for winter warfare in the autumn.</p>
<p>Havas, Soviet border area, 1st – On the 102nd day of the German-Soviet war, the major trends on the various fronts are as follows: (1) Northern Front: Finnish troops have occupied Petrozavodsk, the capital of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. The city has a population of 50,000 and is a station on the railway to the port of Murmansk. Before retreating, the Red Army resisted with all its might and transported away all the machinery from the factories. The battle situation in the far north is now centered on the port of Murmansk. As for the Red Army in Leningrad, it still launches surprise attacks from time to time, despite being heavily besieged. On the night of July 29, the Red Army concentrated hundreds of tanks and broke through the German lines to the east of the city. Tank and air force units from both sides engaged in fierce battles for several days. Generally speaking, the situation in the area has not changed since the 19th of last month. The German army seems to be waiting for the morale of the defenders to be demoralized before launching a final attack. At the same time, the German army has also transported a batch of heavy artillery to the Petrodvorets coast to bombard the Soviet naval base of Kronstadt. (2) Central Front: Under the command of General Timoshenko, the Red Army has launched a counteroffensive, diverting part of the German army's forces. The German army is now welcoming and resisting from different directions. (3) Southern Front: Italian troops are advancing towards Kharkov in Ukraine. The Red Army has dispatched hundreds of tanks in the area, and both sides are engaged in fierce battles.</p>
<h3>Red Army Achieves Another Great Victory in the Central Sector, Defeating a German Infantry Division</h3>
<p>TASS, Western Front, 2nd – On September 27, a regiment of the German 292nd Infantry Division and the 268th Infantry Division, which had been reorganized after being defeated in Ilyino, launched an offensive in the S River area. On the 28th, the Red Army, under the command of Bobrov, began a counteroffensive against the enemy. Artillery, aircraft, and tank units assisted the infantry in repeatedly striking the enemy. After three days of fierce fighting, the 268th German Infantry Division was finally defeated. More than 1,800 corpses of Nazi soldiers were left on the battlefield. Our army seized a large number of spoils of war, including eight cannons, fifteen machine guns, five small cannons, more than 600 landmines, four radio stations, countless rifles, bicycles, and other military documents. The total number of spoils of war has not yet been counted. In the pockets of the dead and captured German soldiers, the Red Army found a large number of items looted from peaceful civilians, such as silk stockings, shirts, etc. Everything that could be looted was there. The remnants of the defeated German infantry division were driven back to their original positions.</p>
<h3>Britain to Intensify Air Offensive Against Italy</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – According to parliamentary members, the British side will intensify its air offensive against Italy. The intensification will be in the general strength of the British air force offensive, and targets may not necessarily be selected for intensified attacks. Various questions were raised in the House of Commons yesterday regarding this matter. The government side answered that questioners could refer to Churchill's remarks on Sunday.</p>
<h3>Britain's Warning to Finland Remains Unanswered</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – Foreign Secretary Eden said in the House of Commons yesterday that the British government has not yet received a response from the Finnish government after warning it that if Finland persists in invading Soviet territory, Britain will be forced to treat Finland as an open enemy. Liberal MP Mander asked if the British side had a time limit for the Finnish government's response and whether it should not be allowed to delay indefinitely. Eden replied, "I would prefer to handle this kind of negotiation in my own way." (Cheers)</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Flower: Cotton Yarn Market Overwhelms, Shorts Lack Resistance, Spot Market Sees 1885 Yuan, Futures Absorption Strong, Jump of 40 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be strong, with an exceptionally high rate of increase. This is because the cost of raw materials is rising steadily, leading to a daily increase in factory costs. Demand from Southeast Asia continues unabated. Factories, due to the high price of raw cotton, find it extremely difficult to sell. As a result, there is a shortage of many spot goods. Actual trading developments involve accepting orders from Southeast Asia and sourcing Double Horse factory orders from the market, transferring the yarn from factories for shipment and export. As a result, warehouse receipts are being collected daily, and the number of chips in the market is becoming increasingly tight. The amount released by shorts is quite substantial. Under such circumstances, near closing time, buyers are trying to borrow warehouse receipts but are unable to obtain enough. Aside from offsetting at market prices, there is no other way, and they lack the ability to resist. On the other hand, they are re-entering the market to roll over positions overnight. Therefore, the premium for shorts is very high. This morning, each package of shorts paid a premium of three to four dimes to the longs. In the afternoon, it increased to one yuan, but it was not enough to roll over the full amount, indicating the scarcity of warehouse receipts. 20-count doubles were priced as high as 1,860 yuan and as low as 1,846 yuan. The off-market price was 1,861-2 yuan. The initial afternoon price was 1,865 yuan, then weakened to 1,860 yuan. News that the exchange's cloth prices were jumping caused excitement and panic, and buyers covered their positions at market prices. The market floor was chaotic, and shouts reverberated, from 60 yuan to 70 yuan, directly reaching 1,885 yuan. However, as some profit-takers sold, it loosened to 1,877 yuan, but at the close, it rebounded to 1,880 yuan. Off-market trading was tight at 1,883 yuan, with speculative trades at 1,881-2 yuan. Today, 850 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened strongly, as last night's prices had already turned upward. The opening price was 1,852 yuan, rising directly to 1,860 yuan. However, profit-takers sold, and shorts became active, causing it to loosen to 1,818 yuan. At this time, the shorts on the floor were under heavy pressure. However, the exchange price initially rose and then weakened. Therefore, the longs were watching, while the sellers were quite active. The market fluctuated between 1,856 yuan and 1,848-9 yuan, within a range of ten yuan. Subsequently, near noon, the shorts felt the pressure of chips was particularly tight and actively covered their positions. The market suddenly turned upward in the last five minutes, and the closing price was 1,858 yuan. However, the off-market price reached 1,862 yuan, with few sellers. The daily transaction statistics showed 15,070 bales traded. The amount bought by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 50, Southeast Asia 2, Dealers 15,000, Total 15,070</p>
<p>The Golden Double Horse futures market is trending upwards, and the momentum is expanding. The hearts of all gangs are boiling, and the absorption is lively, setting a record since the market opened. This is due to the sharp rise in US cotton and the strong increase in factory orders. New high prices are emerging one after another. In addition, the violent rise in the exchange has further aroused the excitement of buyers and the panic of shorts. Therefore, futures yarn is soaring on the strength of the market, and new peaks are constantly emerging. The long-held shorts are under intense pressure from all sides and seem unable to support themselves. As a result, the floor is becoming increasingly firm, completely dominated by buying sentiment, leading to a near-high closing price. The morning opening already showed signs of a strong advance. October futures were at 1,732 yuan, up 3 yuan. November was even stronger, at 1,745 yuan, a sudden increase of 2.5 yuan. December futures were at 1,769 yuan, also up 10.05 yuan. Although there was a slight pullback at one point, it was quickly pulled higher. In the afternoon, as spot goods continued to trend upward, shorts increased their efforts to cover, and the market became increasingly firm, surging more than 30 yuan. The firmness of the base is rare. If mixed brands and factory orders do not see a reversal, then futures yarn should also see further gains. However, if it encounters a setback, then a pullback is inevitable. New longs should pay particular attention to this. As a result, near and far-term futures both soared by more than 40 yuan. The market activity is listed below:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Continue Upward, Cotton Merchants' Expectations Rise, 6,000+ Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is experiencing a sharp rise, resulting in the emergence of new peaks. This is due to the weak inventory of raw cotton spot goods. At the same time, yarn and cloth continue to rise, and expectations are very high. Holders of goods are keeping them tightly held. However, the factory's yarn sales are picking up, and intentions are gradually emerging. As a result, sentiment is improving. The price of 33-count raw material Peng Jia Pu has risen above the 600 yuan mark. Although the market price is high, the desire to sell is quite weak.</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng Wheel arrived last night, carrying a large batch of cotton from Hong Kong, totaling 5,636 bales, and was unloaded at the Rochefort Wharf. This cotton was shipped from Bombay to Hong Kong and then transshipped to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose due to purchases by peers and New Orleans futures purchases. Furthermore, unfavorable short-term cotton production harvest statistics led to active covering. As a result, closing prices surged by 40 to 50 points per pound.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to profit-taking by longs and selling by speculators. Subsequently, it rebounded due to purchases by European exporters and continuous covering by yarn factories. Yesterday's closing prices rose by 1 to 4 rupees. It is also predicted that today's opening market conditions will rise by 4.75 rupees due to the strong gains in US cotton.</p>
<h3>Grains: The Rice Market Situation, Still Struggling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market initially weakened and then rose, with prices continuing to consolidate. The opening price of foreign rice in the morning was still fair, and profit-taking was seen in view of sufficient inventory. Public sales were able to obtain foreign exchange assistance, allowing for a steady stream of arrivals. Furthermore, 58,000 bags of warehouse rice had been sold at a low price. Therefore, initially, sellers were still trying to maintain prices, and scalping was still active. At the time, the situation was quite tight, but because each market had already risen sufficiently, it was not easy to rise further, and they often hovered around the original prices. Banks and warehouses were still offering 118.2 yuan and 118 yuan, while foreign warehouses were offering 118 yuan. At this point, some floating holders took advantage of the flat prices to sell, and the market showed signs of weakness. Small-pattern transactions returned to 117.5 yuan and 117 yuan, but in an instant, large buyers absorbed the supply, and prices returned to their original levels. At this time, spot buyers who had been watching for a long time, seeing that the market was firm and unwavering, also stepped forward to add to their positions. As a result, No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon and Siamese goods, due to the scarcity of market goods, were more concentrated than small-pattern transactions, and prices were strong. The result of the closing price statistics was that No. 1 Saigon high-quality goods reached 134-5 yuan, medium-quality goods were 133.5 yuan, and low-quality goods were 131 yuan. No. 2 goods were 123.5 yuan and 121 yuan. No. 1 Siamese goods were 131 yuan and 129 yuan, and No. 2 goods were 118 yuan, down to 115.5 yuan. Min Dang medium-quality goods were 128 yuan and 125 yuan, and high-quality goods were 133 yuan. Java sharp goods were 120 yuan, and high-quality goods were 133 yuan. Rice tea was 97 yuan, and broken sharp goods were 95 yuan, down to 91.5 yuan.</p>
<p>New domestic rice and new sharp rice have been arriving steadily, and it is expected that the flow will gradually increase in the future. Therefore, they have remained flat amidst the rising prices of old rice and foreign rice. Yesterday, 120 bags of Kunshan new rice arrived, priced at 151 yuan, down to 146 yuan. 124 yuan for new Yang sharp rice, and 130 bags of new Du sharp rice, a total of 6-70 bags, the price is similar to the previous market. However, the inventory of old rice in the north road is exhausted, and only a small batch of more than ten piculs of early thin rice arrived. The owners of the goods are holding out for higher prices, and sentiment is upward. The price has risen sharply to 155-6 yuan, which is 4-5 yuan higher than the previous day. There is a shortage of Du Yuan rice, and foreign yuan rice is being exchanged. 250 bags of domestic rice, 10,000 bags of foreign rice, and another 500 tons arrived.</p>
<p>The former French postal ship General Chaffey brought a large quantity of foreign rice from Saigon. It is now known that the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. It is now known that it is actually corn, totaling 29,698 bags. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Flour Market Stable, 580 Cases of Tobacco Silk Arrived from Tianjin Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign flour market opened fairly stable in the morning. The selling prices of American and Canadian flours were close to the previous close. The market had no major fluctuations given sufficient inventory and a balance between supply and demand. However, local retail sales have not yet shown signs of decline, and speculators are absorbing the supply and engaging in scalping transactions while prices are flat. Moreover, with rising prices for oil, rice, and all goods, the solid base of flour is particularly favored by those with an eye for business. The market is gradually improving amidst active trade, but there are still profit-takers selling. Large customer orders have not yet been inquired about. As a result, the closing price was up two or three cents from the night before. Battery brand flour opened at 35.15 yuan, rose to 35.25 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 35.4 yuan. Jinlong West Warehouse was at 33.25 yuan in the morning, rose to 33.45 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 33.3 yuan. East Warehouse was at 33.78 yuan, Banana at 34.7 yuan, Green Treasure at 34.65 yuan, and Flying Scissors at 32.5 yuan. The after-market also saw bids at higher prices. Wheat shortages are also tight.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Owners Raise Prices, Market Rises Another Five Yuan</h3>
<p>Speculation on soybeans has suddenly intensified. This is because, while the arrival of goods is not high, owners are taking advantage of high oil prices to significantly raise prices, forcing spot buyers to raise prices in order to obtain supplies. As a result, the market has risen sharply by three to five yuan. Market transactions included 150 bags of Tianjin Jin Yuan, more than 250 bags of Guide soybeans, more than 200 bags of Qingkou soybeans, and one cart of Changzhou Niupi beans.</p>
<p>In addition, 688 bags of raw peanuts and 200 bags of beans were shipped from Tianjin yesterday. Today, 230 bags of sesame and 1,200 cakes of bean cakes were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Rice Weevils and Cotton Gangs Wreak Havoc on the Oil Market, Prices Rise Sharply by 10 Yuan, Taking a Hands-Off Approach</h3>
<p>Yesterday, speculation in edible oil became increasingly heated. Rice weevils openly displayed their magic, and cotton gangs and brokers also helped each other, causing the oil market regulars to lose control and retreat instead. Cottonseed oil and rapeseed oil surged by as much as ten yuan under the manipulation of outsiders. Raw soybean oil was also in demand. A certain party of the Dada Oil Company, which was in contact for business, also took the opportunity to raise prices and refused to sell cheaply. This kind of futures oil trading is enough to disrupt the official market, and the person in charge is taking a laissez-faire attitude, and it is unknown what the intention is. The total market sold 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil and Yantai soybean oil, and 1,000 cans of Yantai listening soybean oil. Daya Factory has more than 20,000 piculs of clear oil futures, and Rihua Factory has more than 1,000 barrels of rapeseed oil futures. (Prices are detailed in the market price column)</p>
<h3>Finance: Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Loosens, Spot and Futures Markets Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market, spot and futures both saw price increases. Because the private regular price of Shanghai exchange was not as loose and cheap as the previous day, the hearts of all parties were inevitably firm. The current exchange rate has not been transmitted on time, causing uneasiness among operators. Spot gold shops and foreign exchange dealers sold, pressing down twice to 7,560 yuan. Soon after, they were absorbed by Xiang Xing Yong, Ming Feng, Heng Ji, Dingsheng and others in succession, rising several times to 7,590 yuan, and finally pushed up 30 yuan. The total daily transaction was about 3,800 taels. Spot transactions were rare. First, He Sheng Jin Yi Da sold ten taels, and the price rose to 9,300 yuan, a high of 20 yuan. Suddenly, Da Feng Lai sold Ming Feng forty taels, and Cheng Ji sold Xiang He sixty taels, both at 9,290 yuan. Da Feng also sold twenty taels, and Xiang Xing Yong sold ten taels, all bought by Shun Yuan, retreating to 9,280 yuan. In the afternoon, Da Feng sold Cheng Ji fifty taels for 9,300 yuan, up 20 yuan from the previous day. The high and low of the day was also 20 yuan, and less than 100 taels were traded. The price of gold from local gold shops was 9,350 yuan, and the purchase price was 300 yuan lower than the selling price. Ornaments remained flat.</p>
<p>Futures gold up 30 yuan</p>
<p>Futures gold opened this morning for each bar (ten taels). Because He Sheng, a spot gold shop, bought first, the market rose to 7,590 yuan at 9:30, an increase of 32 yuan. Yu Xing Yong and Hong Qing Yong sold, and the market retreated to 7,570 yuan. Yi Li bought and lifted the price to 7,580 yuan. Soon after, they sold out. Jin Yuan, Shi He, and Yong Cheng all sold, and the price fell by 10 yuan, retreating to 7,560 yuan. Xiang Xing Yong and Ming Feng bought and sold back and forth, and the price gradually rose. At noon, the price rose again to 7,590 yuan, and Tian Yuan sold. The market closed at noon at 7,585 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon and rose 5 yuan, to a total of 7,590 yuan. Da Lai, Xin Feng, Xiang Xing Yong, and Tong Kang Yong successively sold, and the price fell by 30 yuan, retreating to 7,560 yuan. Because He Sheng, Heng Ji, and Yi Yuan bought in, the price was raised again, and Jin Yuan advanced to 7,590 yuan. The market then retreated slightly to 7,585 yuan, and finally Dingsheng bought in, closing at 7,588 yuan at 4:30, an increase of 30 yuan from the closing price of the previous day. The high and low of the day was also 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Ornamental gold remains unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang is still listed at 950 yuan, and the purchase price is reduced by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market Returns to Calm</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday showed that the Central Bank and HSBC both listed the same prices. HSBC's small counter price was unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates gradually returned to calm. The British exchange rate was difficult to generate a market price. There were short positions sold at 4.5 yuan for American exchange, and importers who were not allowed to apply for foreign exchange at 4.625 yuan were trying to settle their positions. No transactions were heard all day. The closing price of British exchange was 2/8125, and the American exchange rate was 4.5 yuan, both flat.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 2nd (Thursday) Electric, the exchange market opened this morning was unusually stable, and all exchange rates were unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 2nd (Thursday) Electric, the exchange market opened this morning announced a flat. The telegraphic transfers of London and New York were still unchanged. The "Joint Notes" dark market also stood at the original level, only the Shanghai exchange rate fell by nine cents to 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>No Major Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market showed that British gold pounds and British gold notes were stable as before. American gold notes rose slightly by two cents, and rose to 12.52 yuan in the evening market. Hong Kong notes trended steadily, and the market price stood flat. Japanese remittance notes still stood at the original price of 2.36 yuan. Korean remittance notes tended to decline again, and retreated to 1.03 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Securities: Sichuan Gang's Actions Significantly Affect the Bond Market</h3>
<p>The public bond dark market yesterday suddenly saw the Sichuan gang selling a large amount again. The market price, which was originally bullish, was hit hard, which was unexpected. The midday close was down 567 cents. It is unknown where the Sichuan gang's goods came from. Each sale was a spot delivery, with no lending or other conditions. The outflow of spot goods in recent weeks has been quite considerable, and sales have stopped in the last day or two, allowing the market price to recover slowly. A sale yesterday morning caused another decline, and no sales in the afternoon caused a rebound of 345 cents. From this, it can be seen that the potential is still strong with the long positions. The situation in Changsha has turned advantageous, and the future of the bond market is not easy to underestimate. Yesterday morning, Xinfu and Yitai and a group of retail investors bought in, while Houde and Baolong sold out in large numbers. Hengkang and Hongda's sales were also not weak. Class C bonds opened at two yuan and saw a market price of 05 cents. Afterwards, it slowly declined to 1.4 yuan. The closing price of the day was lower. There were fewer transactions in the afternoon. Sichuan gang sales only included Shengda 90% and Xie Xing Yuan. Yitai and Renfeng bought in. Class C bonds returned to two yuan, and the closing price advanced again, closing at 1.75 yuan. As a result, the market price increased by 3 cents, and the rest decreased slightly by about 2 cents. The transaction was about 156 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, transaction A, 500 shares of underwear company, price 12.75 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market of various industries is very active, and new high prices have been seen for many stocks. When each stock rises, there is almost no reaction. British Union stock opened at 43 yuan, and after opening, it went straight to 46.5 yuan. Rubber stocks were also quite firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market continued to trend upward, but Chebai was weaker. The association's closing price for 24 coarse white sugar imported in the previous month was initially 149.5 yuan to 151 yuan, and 150.08 yuan to 151 yuan in the afternoon, up 1.5 yuan. Imports in August were 149.5 yuan to 150.05 yuan, and 150.02 yuan to 150 yuan in the afternoon, up 1.5 yuan. Imports in July were 149 yuan to 150 yuan, and 149.8 yuan to 149 yuan in the afternoon, up 1.4 yuan. Hong Kong coarse was 140.05 yuan to 142 yuan, 141.2 yuan, and 140.5 yuan in the afternoon, and then to 141 yuan, up 5 cents. Taikoo Chebai B mark was 162 yuan, down 1 yuan. The futures price for coarse white company's Double Tenth Festival was 146.5 yuan, a high of 149 yuan to 148.5 yuan, and 148.6 yuan to 148.8 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 148.6 yuan, up 2.8 yuan. The 20th period was 151 yuan to 150 yuan, 149.5 yuan, and 150 yuan, 151.5 yuan to 151.1 yuan in the afternoon, closing still at 151.1 yuan, up 2.3 yuan.</p>
<p>A small amount of granulated sugar also arrived in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Yong Sheng wheel arrived the night before, and in addition to carrying a large amount of cotton, there were also 500 bags of granulated sugar.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Speculation is Raging, Prices Rise Sharply by 1-2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to trend upward, due to enthusiastic sentiment and rampant speculation. However, retail sales were slightly sluggish, because the purchase of cloths still need to wait for ship reports. The selling price of white coarse cloth rose by 5 cents to 1 yuan per bolt, and the price of fine twill cloth rose by about 1 yuan. The quoted price of bleached and dyed cloth was uneven, and it also rose by about 1 yuan. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 300 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill coarse cloth, etc. The Southeast Asian and foreign gangs handled more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, twill cloth, etc. Today, 42 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Xiamen and 895 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The rising trend continued fiercely. The Dragon Head futures cloth on the exchange rose continuously in the morning and afternoon, rising by 1.7 yuan to 1.9 yuan per bolt. This is because there is a severe shortage of various mixed-brand fine cloth spot goods on the market, and the grade proportions are too different. Seeing that the situation was not good, shorts scrambled to cover their positions, and new longs increased their bets, so the direct money rose, repeatedly setting new prices. The spot market price of fine cloth rose by about 1.5 yuan per bolt. The Dragon Head New Factory order has been sold for 63.65 yuan, and the accumulated stock of fine twill is becoming increasingly depleted, rising by about 2 yuan. The highest price for colored goods Four Gentlemen Serge New Order was 2.35 yuan, and the closing price was 2.3475 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grass Green Woolen Cloth is Selling Well</h3>
<p>Grass green medium-thick serge, thin plain serge, grass green riding breeches, gabardine, and Yizhou have been selling well and actively recently. Customer gangs, such as those in the mainland and guerrilla areas, have needs. Although both sides have strict control, and it is difficult to obtain transportation and sales permits, due to strong retail sales, they are still trying their best to transport and sell.</p>
<h3>Metals: New Bar Yuan Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>The market trend of the latest new bar yuan has been sluggish because the customer gangs in other ports are quiet. Furthermore, the nail factories on this street, seeing the leisure of their production of capital nail tongs, naturally lack interest in raw materials. Therefore, the spot sales of new bar yuan have been greatly hit. In addition, there are few scavengers, only the lead wire factories and screw factories on this street. As a result, actual transactions are not as good as before, and the standard market is also gradually declining. The current market is offering to sell at 250 yuan per picul, while the secret price is 247-8 yuan, which is also traded, a drop of 3-5 yuan from the previous market's sales.</p>
<p>In addition, 48 pieces of galvanized iron arrived from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Matches and Soap are Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>The market situation for daily necessities is becoming increasingly tight. This is because the delivery of goods from various factories is nowhere in sight. Hoarders are watching the market and selling, and retail sales are more frequent. New hoarders have begun to absorb the supply again, so the market is quite tense. The opening price of Phoenix brand matches has risen to 1,090 yuan per box, and Beautiful brand is 1,140 yuan, up 80 yuan to 100 yuan from before. The supply of soap is relatively scarce, and the market is slightly tight. Gu Ben soap is 60 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap is 50 yuan, and Huang Xiang Mao soap is 47.3 yuan. The opening price has risen by 5 cents to 1 yuan per box. Since the factory stopped issuing warehouse receipts for foreign candles a long time ago, the market has turned around to this day, because spot sales are in season, causing prices to be higher than before. Beli's Sailboat brand is priced at 37.5 yuan per box.</p>

<h3>Industry Representatives Go to Hong Kong to Negotiate Supply of Foreign Exchange, Shanghai Communications and China Banks Cancel Commercial Exchange Rate, Many Export Drafts Not Sold as Ordered</h3>
<p>According to reliable news obtained yesterday, the Exchange Stabilization Fund recently sent a telegram to Shanghai, informing each bank authorized to operate foreign exchange that the October exchange settlement method would be handled in accordance with the original regulations without any changes. It was also announced that if various industries believed that it was necessary to raise special issues, the fund was very willing to listen to and accept their opinions. It is now known that in addition to the representatives of the insurance industry, piece goods industry, and film merchants, who have already gone to Hong Kong in recent days, the industries that are preparing to send representatives to the south include the cotton industry, automobile industry, and tobacco industry. The purpose of their trip is nothing more than to explain the difficult situation that each industry cannot develop, hoping that the Exchange Stabilization Fund can increase the supply of a corresponding amount of foreign exchange. At the same time, it is heard that some American merchants will send a telegram to Washington, expressing their support for the Exchange Stabilization Fund's work in stabilizing the currency system and hoping to provide assistance with the restrictions on trade. In short, the focus of the problem has shifted to Hong Kong. After the representatives of the various industries meet with Mr. Fox, the American member of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, and other committees, a decision can be obtained.</p>
<p>Weighing the Importance of Minor Issues</p>
<p>A Western expatriate named Dizzy said, "I recently heard that a large number of merchants went to Hong Kong to negotiate with the Exchange Stabilization Fund. This is really good news, because in the current difficult situation, perhaps some practical solutions can be found. Importers are currently encountering some major difficulties. It should be known that most importers are still trying their best to maintain their business and retain their necessary employees. If the import industry cannot continue, we should be informed as soon as possible so that we can implement layoffs and reduce the scope of business. The merchants who went to Hong Kong this time should ask the Exchange Stabilization Fund authorities to treat goods ordered by legitimate businesses before August 20 and goods ordered after this period separately and specially approve the exchange settlement at a preferential exchange rate." Also, the English-language financial and commercial weekly claimed that eliminating the Shanghai black market is part of the policy of restricting Japanese trade. In fact, Chinese and foreign businesses are inevitably adversely affected by this, but this is only accidental. Regardless of the restriction policy, difficulties are inevitable when it is implemented. The crux of the problem is who suffers the most.</p>
<p>Japanese Export Ban Not Very Important</p>
<p>The report also addressed the issue of the Japanese authorities having banned the export of any goods from Shanghai to Free China, saying that "This order has no major significance at present, because trade between Shanghai and Hong Kong is open as usual, and goods supplied to Free China can of course still be transported to their destination via Hong Kong. However, in general, the flow of goods to Free China is slightly hindered."</p>
<p>Exchange Settlement in Accordance with Exchange Stabilization Fund Rate</p>
<p>In order to unify the foreign exchange management mechanism, the Ministry of Finance specially announced the cancellation of the original commercial exchange rates of 4 1/2 yuan for British exchange and 7.5 yuan for American exchange, and uniformly quoted prices according to the exchange rate set by the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee on August 18. A reporter from Xin Sheng Agency learned from the banking industry yesterday that the China Communications Bank and the China Bank have complied with the ministerial order, but the Central Bank still quotes prices according to the legal exchange rate (British exchange at 1 shilling and 2 1/2 pennies, American exchange at 30 US dollars). Although the application for foreign exchange for imported goods and the sale of foreign exchange for export goods are calculated in accordance with the legal exchange rate in name, in reality, due to the existence of the new exchange rate of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, in order to protect the interests of importers and exporters, they are specially allowed to receive the difference between the legal exchange rate and the Exchange Stabilization Fund rate. Therefore, the result is no different from calculating directly according to the Exchange Stabilization Fund rate. However, it is necessary to always maintain the legal exchange rate and the regulations for receiving the foreign exchange difference.</p>
<p>Export Drafts Must Not Be Concealed</p>
<p>The Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee stipulates that merchants who rely on obtaining foreign exchange from the Exchange Stabilization Fund through authorized or specially licensed banks should sell all export drafts to the banks designated above. If merchants do not comply with this regulation, the Exchange Stabilization Fund will not supply foreign exchange. The Exchange Stabilization Fund will also not supply foreign exchange to importers and exporters who engage in related transactions. The regulations require that they be submitted separately to the Hong Kong office of the Exchange Stabilization Fund for review every week. Since the implementation, the first and second batches have been approved for the supply of foreign exchange. Due to procedural reasons, each batch takes about a week or more. Merchants in the free area have complied with the regulations regarding the sale and settlement of export drafts to banks, but exporters in Shanghai have not yet complied. The Exchange Stabilization Fund has decided to take action in accordance with the established methods.</p>

<h3>Qian's Discussion on Painting By Qin Meng</h3>
<p>The painter Qian Ding has been studying oil painting for nearly thirty years, while also working on traditional Chinese painting, watercolor painting, and pencil drawing. He has traveled to almost every famous mountain and great river. He has thoroughly grasped the secrets of both Western and Chinese painting theories. He has a resolute demeanor and a humble and eager-to-learn attitude. One does not see such qualities often in today's artists. Recently, he has been co-hosting an oil painting exhibition with Zhou Bichu and Zhu Qizhan at the Great New World Painting Gallery. Yesterday, a reporter visited his studio. After offering clear tea, they engaged in a pleasant conversation. Qian's opinions are often unprecedented. This reporter is not talented, and also stands outside the world of painting, but since the principles of various art forms are often the same, obtaining his insights from the lonely art world is no different from hearing welcome news in an empty valley. Therefore, I took up my pen to record it.</p>
<h3>Reflecting Life</h3>
<p>According to Qian, "The expression of art should be a reflection of one's own life. Paint what you like, paint what you love, paint what you feel. Let your inspiration resonate and interact with nature, and let all the vitality and beauty be present within. Otherwise, it becomes an inorganic painting, lacking a soul, even if it has skillful brushwork. A painter's spirit should be 'what the sword points to, the feet reach, the eyes see, and the brush paints.' Most of us who create traditional Chinese paintings neglect this principle. We imitate the paintings of the ancients, read the paintings of the ancients, and seek the ways of the ancients to use for ourselves. However, times change, environments transform, and if we stick to outdated methods, how many can create era-defining achievements? In my humble opinion, painting methods can be divided into Chinese and Western. Apart from expressing spirituality, the premise should be to reflect the things and scenes of the times as much as possible."</p>
<h3>Expressing Spirituality</h3>
<p>"In addition to reviewing the old, we must strive to learn the new. The way to learn the new is to gain experience through personal experience. The ancients said, 'Read ten thousand books and travel ten thousand miles,' and that is what they meant. It is the same for painters. Hear more, see more, experience the situation firsthand, and seek reality widely. In this day and age, the world is interconnected, and traveling ten thousand miles is not difficult. However, one must have a purpose when traveling. From Asia to Europe and America, from Shanghai to Australia and the Philippines, or traveling around the globe, with the convenience of today's transportation, the time taken is short and the distance covered is great. However, this cannot be considered seeing and hearing much, or broadly experiencing space. This is merely traveling ten thousand miles by boat and car, where the phenomena seen are narrow and vague, and what is known is either just the name or the terminology. Therefore, if you want to seek true knowledge and insight, then go back and review the old even more, to verify whether your actions are correct and whether what you know is true. Then, when you express it through brush and ink, your spirit will be concentrated, and our spirituality will also be reflected within."</p>
<h3>Grasping Reality</h3>
<p>"When a person is born into the world, they may live to be a hundred years old, but the average person only lives for a few decades. Ordinary people lack the reality of artistic life, no different from the fleeting beauty of the epiphyllum flower. The expression of art lies in grasping the reality of life and beautifying it. By reflecting it in space and time, it becomes painting, sculpture, drama, music, songs, and so on. Because of this constant expression, human life gains the beauty of the artistic spirit. It excites, delights, invigorates, and moves forward endlessly. Therefore, the way of art truly has an educational function and is one of the elements of culture. Painters, like scientists, religious figures, and philosophers, based on what they feel and experience, explain the true interest of nature and life, and promote a magnified and beautified life."</p>
<h3>Absorbing and Creating</h3>
<p>"Oil painting can be developed into one of our national paintings for the following reasons: First, the organization of a country can include various ethnic groups and various cultures. With today's scientific progress and material prosperity, whether it is a country, a society, or an individual, after absorbing, we should consider how to improve and create. Only in this way can we stand in the world, not be enslaved by others, and not lag behind. Today, our country only considers ink painting as national painting, which I feel is not enough. Oil painting was invented in the West and is widespread throughout the world, each becoming their national painting. We should also take advantage of the convenience of materials and use them. For example, in addition to ox carts, trains are used; in addition to oil lamps, electric lights are installed. Moreover, oil painting can express feelings to a perfect degree, so it is easy to arouse the interest of the artist and the viewer. As for the expression of meaning or thought, oil painting is even more all-encompassing."</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Agricultural Science Students Guide Winter Cultivation Work</h3>
<p>From January to the End of November</p>
<p>(Shaoguan Correspondent) In order to promote increased grain production in the province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has consulted with the Ministry of Education to formulate a construction and education movement plan, ordering agricultural education institutions in all provinces to assign students to assist in agricultural construction work in each province. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has received instructions from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and has formulated detailed rules for the implementation of winter cultivation work guided by agricultural students in the province. Starting from October of this year, students from the agricultural colleges of Sun Yat-sen University and Lingnan University, as well as the provincial Meizhou Advanced Agricultural School, Maoming Advanced Agricultural School, Zhongkai School, Hepu School, Gaozhou School, Yude School, and other agricultural colleges, will be selected and assigned to various counties to guide winter cultivation promotion work nearby. Each student will receive a monthly living allowance of one hundred yuan until the end of November, when the work is completed, and they will return to their original schools to attend classes. According to statistics, more than 100 students from agricultural schools throughout the province are participating in this work, which will promote winter cultivation on more than 50 acres. Assuming an average harvest of one dan of winter crops per acre, the province can increase its harvest of wheat, millet wheat, barley, rapeseed, beans, and miscellaneous grains by more than 500,000 dan this year, which will significantly benefit the food supply in Guangdong Province.</p>

<h3>Autumn Festival Gathering By Mo Chang</h3>
<p>A few days ago, we had a "sun appreciation". The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon, so we inevitably have another "moon appreciation". Observing a solar eclipse is highly suitable for scientific research because it is unprecedented in three hundred years. "Moon appreciation" is the pursuit of poets. Although it happens every year, it is rare in a lifetime. Is it suitable for science? Of course, it is not contrary to logic. Don't you see the big mooncakes on the market? A large airplane is decorated on the cake, titled "Appreciating the Moon by Plane."</p>
<p>This kind of leisurely mood should only exist in Shanghai. People seem to be particularly forgetful and would use airplanes in this way. However, since Chang'e stole the elixir and flew to the moon, we have never forgotten the moon. Mooncakes are indispensable in stores, relying on them for a year's expenses; people never think mooncakes are too many. I waste a year or even a lifetime.</p>
<p>I have this mouth; I eat mooncakes; mooncakes are born for the palate, and the moonlight is provided for the eyelids. Eat and watch frantically.</p>
<p>Enjoying and being nervous at the same time, if this place is compared to that place, there is infinite emotion. "The moon has its phases of waxing, waning, and fullness, and people have their sorrows, joys, partings, and reunions." The Mid-Autumn Festival and the moon are not very closely related to us. The reality of sorrows, joys, partings, and reunions is what life faces. Wandering and displaced because of war, families are scattered, each in a different place, more numerous than the sands of the Ganges. Taking an airplane to the moon is truly the sweet dream of modern Emperor Tang Minghuang.</p>
<p>Okay, a group of people with millions of wealth naturally have a need to escape loneliness. Asking them to eat three yuan mooncakes, it is indeed demanding. But looking at the reality of sorrows, joys, partings, and reunions, please spend less, and it won't be a wrong. For yourself, and for others, you will see it clearly in the future. The whole family is in the west wind, and the September clothes have not been tailored. On a lonely island, bitter things are still indispensable. After the joy of appreciating the scenery, I wonder if there is still a trace of compassion?</p>
<p>The city's National Games is appealing to compatriots to actively promote the winter clothing movement. The Three Religions Daoyi Association is also asking all sectors to save autumn festival expenses to help hidden poor people and street refugees... I guess it won't all be in vain. I think.</p>
<h3>I am an Elastic Daughter in Life's Picture By Qiu Xia</h3>
<p>"The city is burning with carnival fire, passion leaps on the toes... Look! Every smiling face contains sorrow, look! Every smiling face contains bitterness. Under heavy oppression, one still has to use sweet words..." This song has truly written out my life nakedly.</p>
<p>In the early morning, I dragged my tired body out of the man-eating maze - the dance hall. Back home, it was a gloomy and damp kitchen. At this time, my mother had quietly gotten up to prepare snacks for me. I took off my coat, cheongsam, leather shoes, and stockings, and put on a simple purple cloth shirt. After eating some porridge, I fell asleep on the bed that my mother gave up. The hard bed was certainly not as soft and comfortable as the sofa, but the air here was free. I finally fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>When I woke up, it was already 2:00 PM. I quickly got up, washed, ate, and put on makeup, which took me a full three hours. Looking at myself in the mirror, I became a heavily made-up woman again. I deeply hated this grotesque appearance, but reason told me, "For life, be patient!" So, I gently wiped away the tears from the corners of my eyes, picked up my purse, and prepared to go out. My mother said softly: "A Yuan! The landlady has been here, and the coal briquettes are also running out. Can you think of a way?" I pressed my purse, feeling sad, a burst of soreness welled up from my heart to the tip of my nose.</p>
<p>The melodious music resonated rhythmically. The decadent singing floated in the air. Perfume and alcohol stimulated everyone's sense of smell. Pairs of men and women spun in the dance floor, their faces close, their heads leaning on each other. One side was certainly looking for pleasure, but who knew the inner pain of the other side? I sat in a corner, worrying that the fate of eating Tangyuan yesterday would befall me again today. At the same time, my mother's pleading words when I left home trembled in my ears again.</p>
<p>The music started again, and a fat-headed, big-eared guy stood in front of me: the flesh on his face sneered, and his rat eyes stared intently. I remembered the touching and groping when I danced with him a few days ago, and I couldn't help but shudder. But, for the sake of life, I had to smile and greet him, embracing him and entering the dance floor. After a dance, he put a roll of paper in my hand, and besides the dance tickets, there were also five ten-yuan bills. I wanted to return them to him, but considering that his money was originally made by hoarding and manipulating and scraping the sky over our heads, I accepted it without hesitation. At least, the rent and coal briquettes were settled.</p>
<p>When will my father find a job, and I can jump out of this circle of life?</p>

<h3>Biography of Leeching Figures By Liu Tang</h3>
<p>Five, Uncle Li</p>
<p>Emperor Renzong often thought of Lady Li, regretting that she did not enjoy the wealth and honor of the world, so he missed her deeply. Therefore, he treated the Li family with special kindness and married his eldest daughter (the Grand Princess of Zhou and Chen) to Wei, the son of Yonghe. Wei was simple and crude, and could not get along with the princess. The princess once knocked on the imperial city gate in the middle of the night to appeal to the emperor. Wei was demoted because of this, and they never got along well afterward. The princess often stayed in the palace, and when the princess died, Wei was demoted to Chenzhou again because he did not treat the princess well.</p>
<p>I have seen a case in the Bao Gong case called "Mei An," which said that Chen Shimei stopped his wife and married the princess, and was killed by Bao Zheng. According to the records, among the eighty princesses born from Emperor Taizu to Emperor Huizong, the husbands who married the princesses did not include anyone with the surname Chen. Apart from the discord between Li Wei and the Grand Princess of Chen, there were absolutely no facts similar to what is said in the novel.</p>
<p>The person who received the most favor from Empress Liu was Zhang Qi, because he had once lived in his house, and Qi served the empress carefully to repay her kindness. When Empress Liu was in power, she赐 him a mansion of 700 buildings, and he lived in peace and prosperity for more than forty years. He had twenty-four sons, all named with the character "yi," such as Dayi, Keyi, Liyi, and Xiyi. He built winding corridors in his house and accumulated white goods in them, trading with the maids. When a maid was sick, he personally diagnosed and treated her, and paid for the medicine. The family opened a shop, buying and selling among themselves, wanting to keep the wealth in the house and not let the profits flow out. It can be said that the exploitation was meticulous.</p>

<h3>Begonia By Qin Shouou</h3>
<p>Twelve Unexpected Troubles</p>
<p>Before he could "but" any further, Meng's daughter-in-law could no longer bear it.</p>
<p>"Alright, Uncle Wu! Around here in Zhangshucun, no one knows that you are a good person. As long as you can figure out who's playing tricks on Linsheng, just say a word, and won't people follow you back?"</p>
<p>After she said this, Autumn Begonia could only laugh it off with Meng's shopkeeper.</p>
<p>The two sides talked a lot afterward, but Meng's shopkeeper always used soft tactics. Even when Autumn Begonia wanted to take out fifty yuan to give him as travel expenses for Mei Bao to return home, he stubbornly refused to accept it. He kept saying:</p>
<p>"This is all Shang Laoer's fault, how can I let you spend money."</p>
<p>In a state of excessive excitement, Autumn Begonia struggled to climb down from the bed and personally sent Meng's in-laws out.</p>
<p>"Now it's all good!" Zhang Laoer helped Autumn Begonia close the door, almost clapping his hands and laughing. "Zhao Erye's plan is really admirable! If we hadn't snatched their Linsheng as a pledge, how could our daughter come back?" (227) (End of Chapter Twelve)</p>

<h3>Arts and Entertainment World After Watching Zhang Wenjuan's Play</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, Zhang Wenjuan performed several plays, "Sang Yuan Hui" and "Er Jin Gong," at the Golden Theater. Before that, Yan Shishan and Xiao San Mazi performed "Cui Ping Shan." There was also "Qiao Lian Huan," Ai Shiju stealing chickens as Shi Qian. I was invited by a friend to watch. I don't often see Xiao San Mazi's plays, so I went early. Xiao San Mazi played Shi Xiu, and his appearance was very heroic, making one feel a murderous aura, very much like a hero from the Water Margin. After the quarrel was over, he asked the bartender to borrow a knife, and after getting drunk, he asked for the knife again. Liu Binkun's performance as the monk Hai was also very good. When Shi Xiu was about to kill Pan Qiaoyun at Cui Ping Shan, Yan Shishan's performance and tumbling skills were excellent. Miao Shengchun's Yang Xiong was too comical. Everyone sang in the Bangzi opera style, and the rapid strings made the drama particularly tense. It has been many years since I heard Bangzi opera. Now, hearing it by chance, I feel refreshed. Xiao San Mazi, originally Wang Hongshou (Lao San Mazi), is from the Guan Gong opera school and is good at plays like "Sweeping the Pine" and "Running the City." Now, playing Shi Xiu, he is completely a martial arts role, which is a different skill. Looking at his gestures and expressions, and the singing of the Bangzi opera, it is surprisingly good. It can be seen that he is versatile.</p>
<p>"Shi Qian Stealing Chickens," also known as "Qiao Lian Huan," was previously headlined by Ye Shengzhang. He often used this play to make money. I have never seen Ai Shiju perform this play before. Ai Shiju's steps are light, his speech is clear, and his martial arts are not bad, not inferior to Ye Shengzhang. When eating chicken, he uses burning paper to replace chicken meat and puts it in his mouth (eating fire is a small trick. People haven't eaten it before, so they treat it as novel, but it's nothing. I played the trick of eating fire in private school when I was a child, so I know.)</p>
<p>Zhang Wenjuan sang "Sang Yuan Hui" in a low key, probably saving her energy to sing "Er Jin Gong." On the other hand, Ma Yanfen sang and acted sincerely, with every stroke meticulously done. Gu Shaoquan's Qiu Mu sang in a low key and couldn't sing well. After "Sang Yuan Hui" finished, there was less than ten minutes of rest. "Er Jin Gong" began, and Ma Yanfen played Empress Li on stage. The new tune of the Erhuang Manban was written by a Qingyi amateur. The rhyme was still "you qiu" unchanged. The words were different from the ordinary ones. There was a good sentence: "He treats me as a widow and orphans as cattle and horses," but the old words had "Before I knew it, I had come to the Mid-Autumn Festival," which pointed out the season. This is the most important sentence in the play. Probably singing new words is for the convenience of arranging new tunes. However, my ears are old, and I always like to listen to old tunes. Let's not talk about this, just say that Zhang Wenjuan, who played Yang Bo, sang the "Your Majesty" section. Wenjuan's voice was very good at this time. The first four sentences were sung well. I don't know what happened, but after the fourth sentence, she began to sing "In the ninth month, on the thirteenth, the snow and frost fall, the world's loyal people cannot live long." I thought maybe she was singing another kind of lyric. Who knew that after these two sentences, she turned back and sang "The courtiers have set up a trap,..."</p>
<h3>Adoption of a Single Shift Work Schedule: British Businesses Convene to Consider; Banks May Face Obstacles; Municipal Council Unlikely to Adopt</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that, according to inquiries made today (the 2nd) from various sources, the majority of American and British businesses in Shanghai are expected to adopt a single shift work schedule this winter to conserve coal consumption in the area. The American Chamber of Commerce has already approved this new change in work hours, and the British Chamber of Commerce and the Overseas Chinese Association are following suit, holding a meeting yesterday, the 2nd, at 5:00 PM, to</p>
<p>Consider the matter.</p>
<p>The discussion's outcome will significantly impact the change in work hours and may lead some hesitant businesses to decide to switch to a single-shift schedule. The reporter asked Mr. Hawkins, Manager of the Shanghai Mercantile Bank and Chairman of the Foreign Banks' Association, about the foreign banks' stance. He replied that no decision has been made yet, but he believes that this change will not make much difference because the banks' business</p>
<p>Is not busy.</p>
<p>Another British banker stated that if banks change their business hours, customers will not be able to present checks for cash in the afternoon, which is quite inconvenient. Many banks here have business dealings with branches worldwide, receiving telegrams at any time, which must be maintained. Therefore, changes in business hours will affect the handling of business. A spokesperson for the Municipal Council stated this morning that the council has not yet studied the single-shift work schedule and that the important departments of the council are unlikely to adopt this method.</p>
<h3>First-Class Cabin Fares of Two Shipping Companies Increased by 10%</h3>
<p>The passenger fares of the North and South China Sea routes of the British Jardine Matheson and Swire shipping companies have been repeatedly increased, as reported in the newspapers. At the beginning of last month, ship ticket prices increased again, but first-class fares were not increased. It is now learned that the two companies have again agreed to increase first-class fares by 10%, effective from the previous day (the 1st). The fares are calculated in Hong Kong dollars, and first-class is divided into three classes: A, B, and economy class. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>North China Route</p>
<p>Shanghai to Qingdao: A class 40 yuan, B class 35 yuan, economy 30 yuan; to Weihaiwei: A class 60 yuan, B class 55 yuan, economy 45 yuan; the fares to Yantai are the same as Weihaiwei; to Tianjin: A class 75 yuan, B class 70 yuan, economy 60 yuan.</p>
<p>South China Route</p>
<p>Shanghai to Fuzhou: A class 95 yuan, B class 85 yuan, economy 75 yuan; to Xiamen: A class 95 yuan, B class 85 yuan, economy 75 yuan; to Shantou: A class 105 yuan, B class 95 yuan, economy 85 yuan; to Hong Kong: A class 110 yuan, B class 100 yuan, economy 90 yuan; to Guangzhou: A class 125 yuan, B class 115 yuan, economy 105 yuan. All are calculated in Hong Kong dollars. As for Fuzhou and Guangzhou, although fares have been set, there are no ships sailing there yet.</p>
<h3>Animal Protection Society Purchases Flags for Fundraising to Protect Animals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Animal Protection Society's "Blue Cross Quarterly" states that the society has obtained permission from the authorities of both concessions to hold a flag sale on October 18th to raise funds to support the society's expenses. They hope for assistance from all sectors of society. The "Blue Cross Quarterly" contains the diary of an animal protection society inspector, describing his investigations of animal cruelty and inspections of slaughterhouses, dark shops, and stables. In June and July, the society retrieved nine dogs and one cat, returning them to their original owners. Twenty-nine dogs, twenty-four cats, and eight rabbits were given to people for adoption. Thirty-three dogs and one hundred and nineteen cats were humanely euthanized by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Relief Film Shown in the United States</h3>
<p>In order to promote sympathy for China among the American people, the Northern Baptist Convention has transported a film depicting wartime relief for Chinese refugees to various locations in New York, Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, and other cities for continuous screenings, inviting the American people to attend. The number of attendees is quite crowded. Screenings are also held in various schools during the week, exclusively for students to watch, with significant positive effects.</p>
<h3>Impressions of a Japanese-Manchukuo Railway Director After Visiting the United States</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that the Japanese-language "Continental News" stated today (the 2nd) that among the passengers on the American President Lines' "President Tyler" ship, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st), were thirty-eight Japanese people who had withdrawn from Europe and the United States. Mr. Nakanishi, a director of the South Manchuria Railway, was also among them. He told Japanese reporters that he had traveled from Lisbon to the United States, staying for several days, and returned east by ship. His impression was that the United States is now vastly different from what it was before, and it has become a major power. Therefore, the Japanese must change their view of the United States. In the past, the United States followed the lead of public sentiment in governing, but now the government leads the people. Currently, some Japanese expatriates have had to abandon their businesses, which they have been developing for many years, and are hurrying back to their home country, which is quite regrettable.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ruogu Still Detained by the Police</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Ruogu, an editor at the American-owned "China-America Daily News," was arrested on the 24th of last month in the French Concession by Japanese military police together with French police officers. Yesterday, after inquiry, Dr. Denny, an Italian lawyer hired by Mr. Zhang's relatives, asked what crimes Mr. Zhang had committed and what laws he had violated that led to his arrest. The result of the inquiry was that the police were free to deal with the case or release him. Mr. Zhang was still taken back to the police station for temporary detention. Currently, Dr. Denny is continuing to negotiate with the police, arguing that Mr. Zhang's arrest has no legal basis and no charges have been filed. He is asking the police to uphold justice, protect human rights, and release him immediately to appease public expectations. At the same time, the "China-America Daily News" has also appealed to French Ambassador Cosme to uphold justice and humanity and immediately translate the case of Mr. Zhang Ruogu.</p>
<h3>"President Tyler" Sailed South Last Night</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' global mail ship "President Tyler" arrived in Shanghai on the 10th and docked at berths 12 and 13. Among the passengers was a woman, said to be Mrs. White, wife of a lawyer for the Shanghai Municipal Council. She is the first American to be granted a passport and allowed to come to Shanghai. At 6:30 PM yesterday, the ship left Shanghai for Hong Kong, Luzon, and Singapore. It is said that about one hundred passengers were brought from the United States, and about eighty of them were traveling to Southeast Asia on the same ship. More than seventy people from this city also took the ship to Southeast Asia. The ship will not go to India and return to China via another route after reaching Singapore. It will still have to return to Shanghai and then back to the United States, arriving in Shanghai around the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Thai Ship Detained, Forced to Unload Cargo</h3>
<p>At the request of the Japanese military police, the Shanghai Customs authorities are still detaining the Thai ship "Suriya Thai Nawa" today (the 2nd). It is said that about 2,000 tons of cotton and cloth carried by the ship must be unloaded, as the Japanese side claims that these goods are intended to be transported to the wartime capital to manufacture military uniforms. According to a statement from the Japanese military this morning, the Thai ship will continue to be detained until all the goods have been unloaded and handed over to the Japanese authorities for safekeeping. It is expected that these goods will be unloaded soon, so the Thai ship may be allowed to leave in a few days. At the same time, the Japanese side recently announced that the British ship "Kinai Maru" was previously found by the Japanese to be carrying a large amount of goods intended to be transferred to the wartime capital, leading to its detention. Now, all the goods have been confiscated, and the ship sailed to Hong Kong last Saturday.</p>
<h3>French Concession Clock Not Set Back; Daylight Saving Time Abolished; Announcement Awaits Agreement Between Two Concessions</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I was surprised to read in today's local news section of your esteemed newspaper the statement that "the French Concession Municipal Council announced that it will restore the old time from today, setting the clock back one hour last night." The clock change that the bureau made from today is for the office hours of the bureau's organs (except for Saturday afternoons, from 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day), and not to change the summer time. If it is determined to officially restore the old time, it will be announced separately before being implemented simultaneously with the Public Concession authorities. I am sending this letter specifically, hoping that your esteemed publication will pay attention to it and promptly correct it to avoid confusion and misunderstanding. I am greatly indebted to you. Sincerely, the General Secretariat of the French Municipal Council. October 1, 1941. According to the Municipal Council Information Office, the Bureau currently has no decision on the daylight saving time. As soon as the Board of Directors decides, it will be announced. As for the office hours of this bureau, they have been changed to 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM from yesterday (the 1st), as usual.</p>
<h3>Authorities Intend to Levy Additional Taxes on Exchange Buildings; Business Special Tax Decided to Be Levied Next Year; 8% Levied on All Valuations</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Council, the case of the special tax on business premises that the Bureau intends to levy has been submitted to the Special Advisory Committee for deliberation at two meetings. As a result, the committee approved the case in principle, but advocated that the basic rate of the special tax should be 8% and that the establishment of Category B in the original plan should be cancelled. The securities, gold, and commodity exchange buildings listed in Category B should be merged into Category A to levy the special tax.</p>
<p>This approach</p>
<p>Will only reduce the Bureau's revenue by about 13,000 yuan. The majority of the committee members believe that instead of establishing a separate category for each exchange building and levying a special tax, it is better to collect "taxes" from them in other ways. As for the establishment of Category B, it may be implemented later, and it will be easier to fairly determine which</p>
<p>Special business</p>
<p>Should be included in this category when the "New Tax Source Committee" can suggest other taxes. At the regular meeting held by the Bureau on the 1st of this month, it was resolved to accept the committee's opinion and temporarily abolish Category B. All types of buildings that should be subject to special taxes will be levied at a basic tax rate of 8%. Therefore, the Bureau decided to levy a special tax of 8% per year on all types of buildings used for profit-making businesses, including offices, shops, factories, warehouses, and docks, based on their valuation, from January 1st next year. Also,</p>
<p>Cigarette license</p>
<p>The tax has been decided to be postponed for classification. After investigating the business conditions of each cigarette paper shop, the classification method will be considered. It is reported that the Finance Committee is continuing its investigation, and no decision can be made for the time being.</p>
<h3>Court Full Judgement in Passenger Pushed to Death by Ticket Seller: Death by Pushing Firmly Established; Defendant's Brutal Nature Irreconcilable</h3>
<p>Wang Wanxiang from Hai, ticket seller No. 358 of the British Electric Tramway Company, pushed passenger Xiang Dongchuan off the trolleybus on Route 20 on September 13 because he failed to extort money, resulting in Xiang's death. After the arrest, the police attorney Zhang Tianyin prosecuted Wang for intentional injury causing death, requesting the maximum penalty. After this case occurred, the usual attitude of the ticket sellers and their various extortion attempts had left passengers with a deep negative impression. This time, the ticket seller dared to push a passenger to death because he failed to extort money, causing public outrage. After trial judge Shi Meiyu clarified the matter, Wang Wanxiang was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of his civil rights for life. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Now, Judge Shi has prepared the judgment and delivered it separately yesterday. The main points of the judgment and the reasons for the judgment listed in the judgment are excerpted below.</p>
<p>(Judgment) Wang Wanxiang is sentenced to life imprisonment for intentional injury causing death, and is deprived of his civil rights for life (details omitted).</p>
<p>(Reasons) It has been found that the deceased Xiang Dongchuan had purplish blue and swollen veins, bleeding from the nose and mouth, a superficial abrasion on his left shoulder, and a deep red spot on the back of his head, about the size of a silver dollar. He was injured and died before his death. It has been verified by the prosecutor of this court together with the forensic doctor and a forensic report has been filled out and filed. When questioned, the defendant Wang Wanxiang claimed that the deceased jumped off the bus himself and denied that he had pushed him. It has been verified that the defendant had a dispute with Xiang Dongchuan over</p>
<p>Embezzling bus fare,</p>
<p>And how he became enraged and forcefully pushed Xiang Dongchuan out of the bus, causing him to fall and die. The witnesses Jiang Jing and Xu Shenjin, who witnessed the incident on the scene, have given sworn testimony. After separate questioning by this court, their testimonies were consistent and without any flaws. The said tax decision was suspended, etc., all being young students, and they had no prior grudge against the defendant Wang Wanxiang. Based on their direct observations, they stated the facts truthfully, and what they stated was</p>
<p>Consistent with the facts.</p>
<p>It is sufficient to be adopted as conclusive evidence. Also, according to witness Xu Shenjin, he and the deceased were standing at the door of the car at the time, facing inward and with their backs to the outside. When the deceased was pushed, he reached out and grabbed Xu's left arm, causing him to fall out of the car as well. Furthermore, the forensic report issued by the Procuratorate stated that the deceased's fatal injury was in the head, which shows that Xiang Dongchuan was pushed down facing upwards. The defense that he jumped off the bus himself and died is untenable. As for the witness Yan Defa,</p>
<p>He was not present at the scene</p>
<p>At the time of the incident. He suddenly appeared in court during the trial and made unsubstantiated statements, attacking Jiang Jing's testimony. His testimony is not sufficient to prove the defendant's innocence. According to the witness, Jiang Jing rang the bell twice, and Xiang Dongchuan fell down. This also contradicts Wang Wanxiang's argument that Dongchuan pressed the bell himself and jumped off the bus. His false statement has been exposed. Based on the above analysis, it is</p>
<p>Firmly established</p>
<p>That Xiang Dongchuan was pushed off the tram by Wang Wanxiang before his death, fell and injured the back of his head, and died. Although there is no sufficient evidence to prove that he had the intention to kill, he cannot escape the responsibility for the crime of injuring a person resulting in death. The defendant is brutal in nature and pushed a passenger to death because he failed to embezzle bus fare. Not only the deceased and his family suffered harm, but also the general public felt a considerable danger. Furthermore, the defendant was evasive after the case was solved and had no remorse. Considering his motive, method, and the resulting harm, danger, and attitude after the crime, it is truly</p>
<p>Irreconcilable.</p>
<p>It is not enough to give him a full and severe punishment to serve as a warning. In accordance with Articles 291 and 292 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 177, paragraph 2, Article 57 and 37 of the Criminal Law, paragraph 1, the judgment is as stated in the main text. September 26, 30th year of the Republic of China. Judge You Meiyu.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Incident Occurs on the Bund, Amidst the Noise of Traffic; British Merchant Ha Hui Shipyard Comprador Zhuang Zhicheng Abducted While Crossing the River</h3>
<p>The trend of kidnapping has become rampant again. Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, another kidnapping incident occurred near the Jianghai Customs Wharf on the Bund, amidst the noise of traffic. The victim was Zhuang Zhicheng, a comprador for the British Ha Hui Shipyard in Ningbo Fenghua. Zhuang is 47 years old, married to Qian, and has five sons and six daughters. Recently, Zhuang moved his family to Pudong to facilitate his work. Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, Zhuang, dressed in a Western suit, went to Pudong from the shipyard's general office at No. 320 Sichuan Road, Puxi. He took the factory's small steamboat Anatai from the Customs Wharf to cross the river. Unexpectedly, four kidnappers were lying in ambush on the wharf. Two kidnappers held pistols and rushed forward, grabbing Zhuang and forcing him into a bandit car No. 3669 parked on the side of the road, and drove away quickly, disappearing without a trace. After the police inquired, a case was filed and detectives were sent to investigate the scene and ordered a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Accountant of Xingchang Rice Shop Shot Dead</h3>
<p>At 9:15 PM last night, at No. 485, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Datong Road in the Public Concession, while the Xingchang Rice Shop was closing, a robber broke in, pulled out a Mauser pistol, and threatened them not to make a sound. At that time, all the legal tender in the shop had been put into the safe. The robber forced Zhang Ziliang, the accountant of the shop, to hand over the key, but Zhang Ziliang firmly refused and shouted for help, which angered the robber, who shot him. Zhang was shot four times, one each in the back of the head, top of the head, left chest, and back. Because the injuries were in vital parts of the body, he immediately fell to the ground and died. The robber, seeing that he had caused trouble, fled without robbing anything. Afterwards, the police called an ambulance to send Zhang Ziliang to Baolong Hospital and then to the morgue for autopsy. However, according to another source, the doors of the shop were closed last night after closing, only the small door on the folding door was not closed. Suddenly, a man with a Mauser pistol shot five times inward from the small door and fled. Zhang Ziliang, the accountant of the shop, was the first to be hit, and was hit by several bullets, injuring vital parts of his body and killing him.</p>
<h3>Wu Bonian Kidnapped: Car Found in Nanshi</h3>
<p>At about 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, Wu Bonian, the manager of the Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Qunyi Fang, Ningbo Road, was kidnapped at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Fujian Road, along with his car No. 810, by four bandits. There has been no news of him to date. It is now learned that Wu's car No. 810 was found at about 4:00 PM that afternoon near the Public Sports Ground on Nanjing Road. It has been taken away by Wu's family.</p>
<h3>Preview of the Charity Musical Concert Last Night</h3>
<p>The charity musical concert, which will be held at the Carlton Theatre starting today, was initiated and hosted by the famous Mei Qiaojiemei. It will be performed for four days, with a portion of the proceeds donated to the four orphanages in the city. Last night, a preview of the entire program was held for Chinese and foreign reporters. After the overture, there was a Negro song, Jemei's personal performance of selling wontons, a musical dance performance, the first public performance in Shanghai of the versatile harmonium, assisted by the best drummer Paramount Tony, Dick Dynamo's tap dance, Pingjin Yayun's Peking opera, and other programs, which were very popular.</p>
