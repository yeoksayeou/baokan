<p>社評</p>
<h3>軸心陣綫的損益賬</h3>
<p>號稱春季攻勢，在軸心方面却又往往稱之爲三月攻勢，到了今日，已爲三月十六日；無論其爲春季攻勢，爲「三月攻勢」，至今還未實現；這在時間上至少已白費了半個月的寶貴光陰。松岡洋右之赴歐、如果不是用以轉移視綫掩飾軍事行動的外交煙幕，則又至少足以證實軸心國在發動攻勢前的準備工作，還沒有完全妥貼；因此所謂「三月攻勢」是吾又要落空，將在今後兩星期中見分曉。</p>
<p>假使替軸心國算一算自去年六月法國戰敗以來的損益賬，正的方面值得一道的，有德義日三國盟的的成立，德國兵不血刃佔領羅馬尼亞保加利亞兩國領土，和日本在越南所取得了些尚未十分確定的便宜。但在負的方面可以大書特書的，却不一而足：義國在巴爾幹半島和菲洲大陸的挫敗，已使黑衫同志的威信掃地，希特勒不獨得不到墨索里尼的絲毫助力，反而受了他莫大的牽累，此其一。戰敗的維希政府和西班牙的獨裁元首弗朗哥，雖經德國威脅利誘，企圖迫之加入軸心，共同對英作戰，但截至目前爲止，法西兩國的態度始終還是不即不離，匪特沒有直捷痛快跳入火坑，甚至英美在外交上對於他們也還有爭奪的餘地，使希特勒竟不敢煎迫太甚，此其二。日本雖費盡九牛二虎之力，把泰越和的一慕，導演成功，但實際上還未確佔什麼足以左右南太平洋局勢的重大權益；却打草驚蛇，促成了各民治國在遠東實行聯防的局面，足使日本的南進政策，不得不多所顧忌，欲進又止者不知幾决，此其三。蘇日修好迄今還在渺茫之中，而德蘇關係已因巴爾幹問題而起了微妙變化；蘇聯的「友好中立」，雖勢在必爭，但同時却仍爲軸心國當局顧忌最深的因素，今後稍一不愼，即有全局皆非的可能，此其四。舍此而外，美國態度和行動的積極化，更是最不利於軸心國的一點；過去美國多少還祗限於在精神上爲民治國奧援，但自法國戰敗之後，經過羅斯福總統的當選連任，以迄最近以表決成立之「軍備租借法」，美國外交顯已自精神支援演進到實質接濟的階段；羅斯福總統於簽署租借法之後，立即向國會要求撥款七十萬萬美元，並聲明「任何抵抗侵略的國家，均可在租借法規定之下，獲得美國之援助，甚至土耳其南斯拉夫兩國也有接受美國援助的資格」（昨日合衆社電），這當然是軸心國的致命打擊，也就是已往九個月中所受到的最大一筆損失，此其五。</p>
<p>以上所述，是所謂犖犖大端，請更就最近所發生的一二事實，申論軸心國方面的得失。</p>
<p>第一，希特勒在佔領保加利亞之後，旣未能立即打斷英國和土耳其同盟的關係、又未能懾服希臘迫其放棄抗戰，甚至連南斯拉夫的入盟問題，最初好像易如探囊取物，及今又備見其一波三折，不能夠痛快實現，雖說南國多少已有屈服的跡象，遲早或終於不免步羅保諸國的後塵，低這十多天時間的躭誤，至少已使希特勒不能在美國國會通過租借法案之前，對希臘或其他方面發動攻勢。軸心方面的這種挫折，這種損失，眞是難以估計。</p>
<p>第二，關於松岡赴歐的使命，近日論者已頗多析論，姑無論其目的係在加强軸心勾結，抑或促成蘇日接近，旣有尚待「加强」或必須「促成」之事，足見世人前此所顧慮的德義日三國聯合攻勢，此際還未成熟；所可知者，德國切望日本南進，以牽掣英美，日本却在南進之前，對於希特勒還有所要挾；最主要的條件，不外兩端，一是由德國予以軍事援助，二是由德國保證蘇聯的友好中立，如果這兩層辦不到，希特勒即使再逼得緊一點，日本也未必肯替他「拚命」。據維希消息，松岡此行將向德國要求接濟飛機一千五百架，這是十分可能的；不過，未等松岡此行獲有具體結果，英美方面却已因此多了一種警惕。據聞英國已在考慮擴大援助中國，美國已通過大批太平洋設防經費，同時羅斯福總統並於昨日向報界宣稱：「美國之援華程序，進行順利，政府現方考慮增加援助」，這些又是對於松岡聘問德義的直接答覆。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，可見軸心國方面的一舉一動，匪特不足以嚇退民治國，反而鼓勵民治國，發爲更大更堅的決心，迫其講求有效對策。今後三國同盟如果變不出什麼新花樣，而繼續其九個月來「得不償失」的不利狀態，則行見民治陣綫，在美國實力援助之下，改守爲攻，瞬即轉變而入於主動地位。</p>

<h3>糧食　平準米價誠不難　祇患無整頓決心　就米市以讑米市無可上漲之理由　即到源以察到源亦無中斷之徵象</h3>
<p>洋米經一度秉公檢舉、市面立即下降、足見米價之上漲、完全屬於人爲的囤積操縱、不是自然的趨勢、只要負責者有決心、不再作痴聾、再將居奇不售之大囤戶勒令出售、破除情面、則米市澄淸亦在指顧間耳、因爲上海有二百數十萬石存米、爲自有上海米市以來所無、亦並不是缺米之地方、每天有二萬　萬到埠、而銷路在實際上不足一萬、更不是交通中斷的地方、而目是日有到來堆積有餘的地方、所以平準米價誠不難、只患無整頓決心、故今番一經檢舉、已收相當成效、倘使進一步措施、則米價勢必逐步回平、歸於正常、須知上海四五白萬市民中不慮生活壓迫的有幾人、故米價一漲、全市惶恐、昨市貼價雖未低落、但較前日則略爲安定、小絞米開價每百包貼價已至三千四白元、旋至三千二百元、但因大戶不出與浮戶趁小收買、收市父回起一二元、然比之前市最高價較小每包二三元也、一號西貢每百包貼價祇三千元及二千八百元、又二號貼三千二百元及三千元、叉米茶原包開一百元及九十八元五角、碎米原包開八十八元、均較小二元外、全日交易因囤戶納胃不旺、祇五六千包、然米價稍平、即見蠢動虎息不除、終無寗日、若只作打草驚蛇、則被懲者將呼有幸有不幸矣、</p>
<p>到滬洋米大量不斷、迭誌本報、華綸洋行德達輪、由西貢直接裝來、洋米三萬零九百十三包、碎米一萬六千三百十包、另有苞米九千八百零三包、昨日下午抵滬、停靠浦東鴻升碼頭起卸、昨日有苞米四百四十包、裝太古公司順天輪運烟臺、今日定生輪亦有苞米五百三十五包運烟臺、聞今日又有一法輪由貢裝來洋米三千零四十八噸、預定今晨到埠、尚有大批在後來滬、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、雖屬獨樹一幟、然當洋米黑市稍定、人心亦不無影響、無論店戶、未肯貿然多進、去路遂見轉滯、而貨主爲環境所迫、售意亦鬆、並皆貶短求脫、所以收盤除厚粳以身骨較耐僅降元砠外、其薄稻則跌二元左右、計開常粳斛見一百二十六元、崑山斛粳一百二十四元至一百二十一元、靑角斛見薄稻一百廿元、一百十九元、</p>
<p>糯米際他貨一律疲檔、相隨帶落一二元不等、開香港白元特自一百零八元、决至一百零四元、</p>
<h3>洋粉雖跌不巨　縱有大批到貨　不脫囤戶把持</h3>

<h3>油市　豆油勢難壓平</h3>
<p>昨日花生油市仍守原盤、豆油現貨趨勢稍軟、期貨因調劑公司意欲壓小市面後、轉向原根日商談判訂售後貨、詎業外囤戶及帽子式之投機份子、逢低則進、致全日波浪因之動盪不定、訂四月上交之大連油開盤即挫一元半、入後忽升忽降終在一元左右盤旋、但結果仍被强行支持、相較上日市祇修二角半、統計做開膠州生油五十件、價爲一百十八元、大有廠豆油一百担、價爲一百元、大連油二百桶、價爲一百三十三元、（即日打銀出貨）、四月上交一千二百餘桶、最低價爲一百三十五元二角半、最高價爲一百三十七元二角半、又今（十六日）出口有豆子七百二十八包、及豆餅一千塊、均運往香港、</p>

<h3>連漲五日之金市　續向高峯推進</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、漲風突吿擴大、急遽向高峯推進、價已飛出六千四百元大關外、詢因重慶商業匯兌掛縮、明知無稽、而投機家之機會、仍未肯放棄、力扒外滙、致又趨緊、致金價亦在買勢下、由六千三百廿五元飛上至六千四百卅五元、終見在漲一百〇二元、造成已接連五天之漲勢、半日交易共一萬兩左右、各方人心頗堅、下午週六無市、掉期三月轉入四月期、賣方恒記合盛等貼出予買方四十二三兀、由買方成記等貼進、做開約二千兩、現金未聞做　、價照期交先高三百七十元、後高三百四十元有買戶、飾金關金等均平、</p>

<h3>證劵　內債仍在看好</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况居然趨於盤旋、信孚雖已止賣、而其他各戶仍有賣出、且買戶已不若前日之熱鬧、逢低即有人拉、逢高即有人拋、謠言究未能證實、人心大都向上爲多、昨日祇做半日、開盤人心較强、逐步上漲、丙種再出六元外、和豐·怡泰·順昌·恒孚·聯益·買進、由鼎康·震長·同康·供給、中途久孚·協興元·聯和·亦有出籠、一度見五元五角低價、後以鴻大·久豐·生大·益昌·等仍有買進、稍稍回高、市價乃抵於平、丁種始終未有人問津、故未能開出、結果上落極微、不過甲種稍覺吃虧耳、成交總數、半日約有一百四五十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>發電用煤之事業消耗</h3>
<p>上海生活之大問題、米之外、又有媒、上海電力公司曾以每月消耗之煤約需五萬噸、而按照　前所得供給之煤、僅三萬五千噸、因之工部局勸吿商民、節約用電之治標辦法、復聘用專家組織委員會、研究公允配電之辦法、要明白此項舉動、是否必要、很鑲一九四零年十二月七日之統計、以分析每月發電所需之煤及各業用電所占煤之消耗量一班、</p>
<p>街市公共路燈　二八三</p>
<p>又私人路燈　九四</p>
<p>其他市政消耗　六三三</p>

<h3>紗花　細紗飛漲　雙馬帶起不少</h3>
<p>紗市趨升、且漲風漸强、此因外滙下縮標金大漲、允使買戶活躍、致人心良好、但拋空者大都仍無扒補意　、所以漲勢未見十分劇烈、不過同業大戶吸收之額、非但不出、反見加碼、至於實銷一層、港幫躉批交易、仍鮮起色、惟四二支漲風尖銳、殊堪驚人也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百三十元、低價爲一千四百〇五元、午後因週六停市、投機人們星散、一千四百三十元有人要進云、明日出口棉紗有一百七十件運暹邏、又四百四十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市象尚屬和平、首盤價爲一千四百〇七元、少頃微跌至〇五元、旋後外滙開出、標金上騰、人心頓見鋒利、叫買聲大振、逐步上升至一千叫百二十四元、但空方施壓尚重、又回跌至一千四百十九元、惟金價仍向高峰推進、市情復昂至一千四百三十元、不過盈利者吐出回下、跌至一千四百二十四元收盤、查半日間成交統計七千九百五十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分別如左、</p>
<p>香港　二九〇　內地　一〇</p>
<p>同行七、六五〇　統計七、九五〇</p>
<h3>棉價愈挺</h3>
<p>現棉情况、四二支原料飛騰、因綫價橫跳百元外、所以人心振盪、執貨者皆不願脫售、二十支原料紗市亦向上、加之外滙趨縮、市狀帶挺云、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因各方消耗量龐大、及棉布貿易一再良好、故市况更趨堅昂、結果收盤價格、較之上日飛漲的二十磅音左右、</p>
<p>印度棉市、亦受紐的影響、先因紗廠家及大衆棉商買進而漲、繼之又因空頭抵補再漲、故昨日收盤價格、竟挺進七羅比餘、而同時昨日預測亦再看高一羅比牛、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因美即棉皆挺進不已、市况更入活躍狀態、頻頻見漲，加以現紗平穩、一概局勢利於多頭、於是一般同業間互做販買、更形熱鬧、但以週六關係、成交尚不多、預料下週內當有競爭之局向展開也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠布上落不一　東疋獨見昂騰</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市盤旋、白貨二角半上落、粗布售盤上升不易、手貨價均在廠盤之下、近日稍見回昂、各檔續漲每疋二角半之譜、細布斜紋開價平平、色布綫呢價漲一角半至五角、漂布獨疲、乃因客幫需要强弱之故、本　以週六半天營彙關係、成交甚淸、總計一百數十件、浙東溫兩幫辦色布粗細布一百餘件、粵港幫辦粗細斜紋色布綫呢二百餘件、明日有疋頭一千〇二十五件運香港、又八十五件運運羅、</p>
<p>東布　權續上漲、形勢益挺、白貨龍頭細布上午收盤四十八元八九角、而下午暗盤又緊、有做開四十九元三角、較漲每疋六七角之譜、四君子嗶嘰因同業及囤戶搜羅、升至一元三角六分二五、</p>
<h3>羽紗呢走銷暢達</h3>
<p>羽紗呢題來本客幫威有需要、本街門莊幫大批發戶進胃特健、西服幫亦有配購、蓋實銷將屆、其出路因之節節起廣、舶來品缺乏高貴、故交易自以本廠貨爲暢旺也、（筆者按照今日本廠羽紗呢之市價、舊前年可製舶來品而有餘矣）、昨西貨羽紗呢普通每碼齊沽二十九元左右、東貨廿二三元左右、本廠貨十八九元、拆疋及零剪、則尚須酌加半元耳、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗車白齊漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市以進戶較多、越勢仍緊、續見上展、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白爲八十一元二角至五角、升三角、三月二十日打單八十一元四角、五角·七角·八角、升半元、三月底打單八十一元八角半、八十二元、二元一角、二元四角、升七角、四月十日打單八十二兀七角·八角、荷赤六十三元五角至六十四元、升四角、太古B嘜八十二元二角至五角、升七角、三月底八十二元、DY嘜七十九元三角、HX嘜七十七兀八角至七十八元、</p>
<h3>海味　生粉續緊</h3>
<p>生粉因存底單薄、暫之到貨、以致檔子殘缺不齊、續趨上漲、昨飛麒麟嘜叫一百二十五元、老其林一百元、蛇標一百〇五元、I嘜一百十元、雙TA嘜九十八元、雙T嘜八十八元、小包東貨一百〇五元、查該貨兼有糧食關係、故緊勢未已也、</p>

<p>米價問題、嚴重有日、觀到米情形及棧存數目、足見並非米額缺少、事屬顯然、無可掩飾、兩租界當局自近來米市謠言百出、漲風熾盛、鑒於民不聊生、治安堪慮、爰於前日令米市駐塲探員、將不良米蠧、加以拘捕後、暗盤貼價、昨始略見下降、但米價前途依然嚴重、此種初步辦法雖似見效、仍恐日久生懈、恐難持久、自須雷厲風行、尅速規定統制管理有效方針、免人心常此杌陧、此爲全市市民所希冀者、</p>
<p>決心制裁當可穩定</p>
<p>租界當局、於前日開始對不法米蠹採取嚴峻辦法後、昨日米市暗盤、每石稍行回跌的二元、惟投機份子每遇當局採取嚴厲辦法時、必暫時予以隱避、過後則故態復萌、當局決定繼續查緝在市塲作達法交易之徒、並爲謀釜底抽薪計、對收購現貨囤積者、及囤積大批食米居奇抬價份子、亦將查究法辦、本埠米市、在當局決心制裁下、或可漸趨穩定、昨日由外洋產區運抵本埠米糧、達三萬二千包、統計上週到埠洋米、達二十一萬包、而業已訂購可於本月份內運抵本埠之洋米、尚有四十萬包、</p>
<p>米業要求當局指示</p>
<p>上海市豆米行業、雜糧油餅業、曁米號業、三米業團體、鑒於米價飛騰、非特攸關平民生計、且有碍社會治安、特於前日召開臨時聯席會議、昨據該會方面透露消息、該三公會將於即日聯名致函米糧評價委員會、要求轉懇兩租界當局予以指示穩定民食具體辦法、俾資遵循、據悉、米糧評價委員會早經分函兩租界當局、除要求切實協助外、並請示穩定民食、及取締米市非法交易各項辦法、兩當局迄今尚水正式答復、</p>
<p>堆棧存米調查數額</p>
<p>米糧評價委員會本期（上週四起至本週四止）存米調查、已於昨日竣事、全市（包括浦東虹口中區）各華洋米糧堆棧、存底達六十餘萬包以上、其中最多爲太古堆棧、公共·祥泰·兩棧决之、羅斯福第三、浙江興業·中國銀行·茂泰·等爲第四、上項存米、限於各米棧、至於米號門市、各民食團體代訂、暨市民購囤者、均未調查在內、昨據某米商估計、民戶囤米及民間存米、其數超過棧存、故實在上海存米以二百萬包爲相近、</p>
<p>昨今到米約七萬包</p>
<p>洋米來源湧旺迭誌前報，茲悉華綸洋行德達輪、由西貢直接裝來洋米四萬七千二百二十三包、內中一萬六千餘包係碎米、另有苞米九千八百零三包、昨日下午到滬、停靠浦東鴻升碼頭起卸、該行經理之法輪Gouver　Neur　Genral　A．Varenne號、亦由西貢裝來洋米三十零四十八噸、的有三萬一千包之譜、該法輪將於今日到滬、預定停靠浦東隆茂碼頭起卸、尚有大量洋米在後續來、</p>
<h3>五英董表示　蟬聯競選　下週初可望決定　日僑計畫未透露</h3>
<p>本市英僑協會某員昨（十五日）晨披露、工部局現任五英董、皆願於本年再度參與董事競選、查現任五英董爲凱自威（工部局總董）·海萊·麥唐納·密契爾與鮑惠爾、聞英僑協會已以此事通知各會員、可望於下週初加以決定、又日僑方面昨晨披露、日僑已擬定參加本年度工部局董事競選之計劃、但詳情未經透露、至於美僑方面、已於二月下句推定明思德與阿樂滿兩氏爲美僑候選人、</p>
<h3>日光節約　午夜實行</h3>
<p>本年度日光節的運動、業於咋日午夜起開始實行、江海關雖將時鐘不予撥快、惟各部份辦公時間、則於明日起一律提早一小時、通吿如下、「自本年三月十七日起、本關辦公時間、定爲上午八時三十分至十一時、下午十二時卅分至三時卅分、」至於兩租界內之宵禁時間、則於今日起、亦按照日光節的運動提早一小時執行、又悉本市各大小工廠、將暫緩實行、</p>
<h3>滬西界外巡捕職務　明晨開始撤消　工部局昨發表正式公吿　「持警隊」將於同時接管</h3>
<p>據工部局情報處公吿、「公共租界警務處在滬西界外區域之巡捕職務、擬自本月十七日（星期一）上午十一時起、開始撤消、同時由滬西特別警察隊接管之、」</p>
<p>最後細則仍未商決</p>
<p>滬西「特警隊」、原定昨（十五日）晨成立、接管界外馬路區、而工部局警務處人員之調入「特警隊」者、昨晨皆赴大西路五十七號工特警總署、但「特警隊」之成立、因「最後細則」仍未解決、故叉展期至下星期一日、昨晨赴「特警總署」諸人、身穿特警制服者、僅「總署長」潘達與「第　署長」白蘭金索浦兩人、聞「特警隊」之成立、昨日復吿展緩者、乃因若干細則、猶待解決、且警員制服、頗多尚未製成所致、</p>
<p>明日上午可望成立</p>
<p>據「特警總署副總署長」克立沙昨晨吿記者、警務處派定之警員、料將於星期一日上午十一時調人「特警隊」、屆時將舉行簡單儀式、一俟「特警」開始工作、希望不久能將歹土變成良土、秩序井然云、叉潘達原定昨晨宣誓就職者、茲亦展緩　星期一日、聞刻在滬西擔仟警務工作之公共租界巡捕與「市警」皆將於下週撤退、而將其職責栘交「特警隊」、</p>
<p>稅收問題爭持最烈</p>
<p>「特警」一再延期成立之原因、一爲人選問題、現已全部決定、一爲經費問題、聞在稅收問題未獲解決前、該「署」所需之經費、暫由寗方負擔、現交涉最感棘手者、即爲稅收問題、蓋陳公博要求甚奢、在前上海市長吳鐵城任內、工部局所爭持而不甘放棄者、今將無法保持其完整矣、</p>

<h3>英大使寇爾爵士　定本月底離滬　前日出席皇家空軍協會　對食言毀約者備致譏諷</h3>
<p>英國駐華大使寇爾爵士、前日（十四日）應邀參加英國皇家空軍協會週宴、席間該會代理會長賀倫致辭歡迎、據稱、本會會長沙遜爵士今日未能出席、余謹請諸君爲今日到會之貴賓寇爾大使舉杯爲壽、以感謝大使對本會之扶持、</p>
<p>大使侈言上海舒適</p>
<p>賀發言畢、寇爾大使即起立演說、謂我人目下厠身於「食言毀的」之時代中、余又何能獨免、余奉邀參加此决宴會、本的定不發表言論、然此口頭協定、固不難予以破壞、余此次來滬、殊感愉快、厥爲飲食問題、世人對飲食間題、雖議論紛紛、莫衷一是、然人生中、飲食究爲二大要事、余自返滬後、已享受二者之樂、將繼續至本月底爲止、因余將自該時離滬也、大使又比擬重慶爲筷實之鄉村、上海爲奢侈之巴黎、今由鄉村而至巴黎、由儉入奢、頗多感觸、</p>
<p>亞力山大發表演說</p>
<p>大使發言後、賀倫即請英國大使館參贊亞力山大報吿戰時工作、亞氏籲請英人作重大之犧牲、以爭取勝利、認勝利愈迫近、犧牲愈重大、至成功而後已、昨日出席該會週宴者、除寇爾大使及亞力山大外、大使館遠東情報專員史高脫、及秘書孟齊斯等百餘人、</p>

<h3>經濟思想兩遭壓迫　日本民意沸騰　日常食用物品均感缺乏　民生痛苦各處疫癘流行</h3>
<p>最近到滬之美國大西洋雜誌載一論文云、苦於久戰飽經痛苦之日本人民、今已進入一九四一年、在軍事上、日本之侵華、表面固有勝利、但戰爭之眞相、乃在日本之後方、數千萬之日本人民、受種種惡影響、如死亡。疾病。食物及日用品之缺乏、通貨膨脹等、日本乃係一有秩序及受統制之民挨、對於每星期工作七十二小時之苦工、尚不致有怨言、惟對於每月僅准用糖十二兩、每日只准用火柴四技等限制、則極爲反對、現在國內牛油及麥、均已絕跡、牛乳及米、則甚缺乏、而生活費用之高不可攀、遠非數百萬家庭之能力可及、</p>
<p>思想警察遏阻言論</p>
<p>日本有多種警察橫行、一爲經濟警察、一爲思想警察、其中第一類在兩年內、已逮捕商人六八八〇〇〇名、皆因有私售各種貨品之嫌疑而獲罪、其中如食物·藥品·汽油·皮革·棉花等等、第二種思想警察所逮捕入獄之人民、亦以成十累百計、蓋因精神總動員法所命令國民諸般犧牲之處、多爲人民所怨允、結果則如有敢在宴會上或街談巷語上表示不滿之人、多被瑯璫入獄、至今處囹圄中者、已有大學敎員一千二百人、</p>
<p>食用麤劣痛苦不堪</p>
<p>在龐大之軍器製造工業中、工人之工資極高、尚少受物價高漲之影響、所最苦者、乃在長衫階級如敎員學生店員行員等、物價雖增五倍、而薪資並未增高、食糧之質地、極爲低劣、衣服之材料則無非纖維製之贗品、東京區域六百五十萬人需用之水源極感缺乏、致白喉·猩紅熱痢疾等、大爲盛行、在政府雖諉爲天早所致、實則乃因東京附近軍火工廠　起、大量用水所致、居民如敢呼籲用水不敷、則將被思想響察逮捕、如私用水電、超過限量、則終被經濟警察捕去、</p>
<p>農產减少米荒堪虞</p>
<p>日人嗜細白之米、其米粒鮮嫩而味美、但政府下令每飯中須攙用粗米百分之七十、細米百分之三十、此舉完全爲救濟米荒、日本因人工缺乏、農人多被高價工資誘往軍器工廠作工、致農產更少、祇有從安南·緬甸·暹羅·輸入外米、但一則此種米粗糙、不合日本人胃口、二則日本外滙基金已甚空虛、又多一項漏巵、如本年年成不能較去年改進、則日本高麗二國本年冬季頗有饑荒之可能也、因米糧之短少、致雞猪等牲畜無不减少、雞蛋之產量、遂亦見稀少、</p>
<p>又濟崩潰爲期不遠</p>
<p>日本在兩年前即巳禁止售賣棉織品、即東京之七千名警察、今日亦不復衣毛呢制服而着全棉製之制服、現時併醫藥用之棉花、除軍用外、亦不易購得、其他藥品如碘·金雞納·阿司匹林等、無不極感缺乏、總而言之、凡此種種缺乏、現時均無解決之曙光、而至戰事結束後、日本似祇有出於經濟崩潰之一途、</p>
<h3>法商水電公司　公佈減電辦法　廣吿招牌等不准用電光　經常用電另有節减規定</h3>
<p>兩租界電力公司、以本埠所存煤斤有限、僅可供給數月之量、如無大量運滬、電力供給、勢將遭受影響、故會分請界內居民、節省電力、以資度過當前難關、法租界水電公司、昨特規定限制辦法、通吿界內居民云、爲通吿事、茲因燃料供給困難、租界行政當局、決定立即施行下列辦法、至另有通吿時爲止、計開、（一）</p>
<p>電熱之電流供給除（甲）工業暖氣、（乙）必需之醫療用具、（丙）電灶外、概行禁止、凡用戶有不遵此規定者、應即取消其電流之供給、（二）</p>

<p>電力及非經禁止之電光或電熱、各用戶每月經常用電量、（係指去年同月用量或上月用量）超過五百度者、應自即日起、在其每月用電量五百度以外之部份、至少節减百分之三十、如各該用戶在任何月份均有違反此規定者、則其决月之用電量、應至少節减百分之六十、如有再犯時、則停止供給電流、其限期至少以能補償用去之電流爲度、且應顧及上項節减辦法、（四）凡電力及非經禁止之電光或電熱各用戶、每月經常用電量（說明同上）、超過五百度者、爲公衆利益計、應儘力節制其電流之用量、此項辦法之施行、應由警務處總監及法商電車電光公司經理、各就其職務範圍內辦理之、此布、</p>
<p>存煤據平明社記者昨向公共租界電力公司訪悉關於發電之燃煤、該公司現存有十五萬餘噸、每日所需用之煤斤、總數爲一千七百餘噸、如此則存煤能供給三月之需、預計於减供電流之計割實行之後、則每日需煤量可减至一千四百噸、但此僅爲治標之過渡辦法、至於現下煤斤之來源、除一半由開澳礦務局供給，至於電請倫敦政府撥輪運輸煤斤、正靜候覆電、</p>

<p>緊閉房門堂口侍者初亦不疑有他、迨至晚間九時餘、早班侍者已落班、夜班侍者第二十三號瞥見該號久未打鈴、頓生疑寳、遂前往叩門、久久未應、乃在鎖匙洞隙中窺之、難悉底蘊、乃攀登木梯，開啟上面玻璃窗、瞥見房內電炬明亮、臥塌前</p>

<p>講到讀書的方法，記得我在小學讀書的時候，有一位敎師曾向我們講過很淸楚而又合理的方法：現在讓我把它記在後面，獻給諸位小朋友來採用。</p>
<p>他說：「讀書的方法，要像店家的記賬一樣；店家必須天天記賬，我們也必須天天將功課弄淸楚和溫熱；一個店家不能將賬目停記幾天，到後來在一天再將前幾天未記的賬記上；因為這樣的記賬，勢必內容不能詳細和正確，我們的讀書，也是這樣，不能將溫書的工夫停上幾天，到另一天來溫種下好幾天的功課；否則會使我們混亂不淸。再，店家在每過一星期和一個月時，要查查賬，看看店裏在這一星期和這個月裏有賺錢或虧本，我們的讀書也要每星期和每月的來檢查一下，有甚麼功課記得不十分淸楚或有遺忘的；如果是的，就應該想法把它弄淸楚和溫熟；照這樣的去讀書，那決不會沒有效果的」</p>
<h3>關於飛機的話</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>自誠爭一爆發之後，飛機着實出了十足的「風頭」，東去轟炸，西去偵察，在在殺戮，到處破壞，這可顯出它在天空中是異常的活躍。阿慧對於飛機雖已司空見慣，而且吃了飛機的苦也創巨痛深：使他合家東西奔波最後才好容易的避難到上海，足足已有四個年頭了，他雖常昂着頭在瞧着那些飛機，剛在他頭頂上飛過的一霎時間，軋軋的機聲直鑽進了他的耳朶，只覺得有些異樣罷了。這時他忽然想知道些關於飛機的種種　閒，便要求着他的爸爸。</p>
<p>「他地上的飛機要將上升時，必須要滑走一段路，直到翼下空氣的濃度到達一定程度後，才能慢慢地上升起來，所以飛機塲必需廣大的面積才行。假使在開飛機的時候，飛機前端推進機的翼子，把空氣送到飛機後面來，而地上的風，却像船順風一般的從俊面吹回去，那麼飛機便飛不上去，因此飛機在上升和下降時一定要逆風開駛，所以飛機塲一定有一個圓筒形的測風標記，懸在高竿上，當飛機升降時，便要對準着那圓筒風標的尾巴的方向飛去，這樣便是對着逆風飛行的明證。當在歐洲第一次大戰的初期，飛機正是初次參加戰爭，那時炸彈是裝在機的坐位裏，當要轟炸時，飛機戰鬥員便手捧着炸彈，向下丟去，所以很不方便，而且也不易擲中，幸虧那時的炸彈以小型的居多，要是有半噸左右重的炸彈，那一個戰鬥員如何能勝任呢？後來炸彈便都改裝在翼子或機身底下，只要機關一通，炸彈夾子一開；炸彈便自動的落下，這樣　方便得多，而轟炸所收的效果也增大了不知多少。一架飛機上有兩座固定的機關槍，如果是戰鬥機，還不止兩座，槍彈從前面推進機翼子間射繫出去，最有威力，向後射繫較不便利，所以保護飛機的尾舵最為困難，因為向射繫時，必須留心射着自己飛機的尾舵，傳常被對方乘虛而入，必致一敗塗地，因此現在飛機列隊飛行，往往每三架排成人字形或三角形，在後的兩架何護前一架的尾部，也是這個緣故呀……」父親忽在這裏打住了，因為母親在叫他。</p>
<h3>為什麼要守時</h3>
<p>— 邵瑞英</p>
<p>「不守時」，是我們中國人的老脾氣，那末，做中國人的小子，自然　不能例外了，諸位親愛的小朋友們，你願意做一個「不守時」的小孩子嗎？若不願的話，趕快從今天起。守時起業吧！中國人所以「不守時」，就是在兒童時代，沒有養成「守時」的習慣，因此，小朋友對於這「守時」的問題，要絕對的注意呀！</p>
<p>為什麼要「守時」？就是因為時而去了沒有再來的緣故，朱自淸先生說得很對：「樹葉枯黃了，有再靑的時候，燕子去了，有再來的時候，光陰去了，有再返的時候嗎？聰明的小朋友，你們吿訴我。光去了，有再來的時候嗎？」我雖不是聰明的，然而我敢斷定光陰們不會再返的。那麼守時究有多少好處呢？</p>
<p>第一點不費時間，像我們車子，二時開車，你若二時開車，你若二時一刻到站，車子開來了，等第二班再趁。這中間的光陰，豈不是拋棄了不秒，守了時，就不會這樣，那不是「守時」的好處嗎？</p>
<p>第二點不躭誤事，你若不守時，脫了車子，趕不到那目的地，這時你所要做的工作，就躭誤了，如果重要的事，有關於大體的，豈不更躭誤了許多人的事嗎？守了時，就不會這樣，那不是「守時」的處嗎？</p>
<p>第三點可守秩序，像開會，已定於×日上午××地方開的，而會員到那日，有的八時半已到了有的九時半才到，這樣子前前後後，怎不會使會塲秩序亂不堪？那裏談得到秩序呢？守了時，就中會這樣子，那不是「守時」的優點嗎</p>
<p>第四點辦事率增，因為不守時刻，你所做的工作，一定不會比人家多，守時的人，做了二件事，你却只能做一件事，你也守了時，辦事効率就不會這樣，那不是「守時」的好處嗎？</p>
<h3>沙和泥的談話</h3>
<p>— 落英</p>
<p>沙和泥有一天遇見了，這個兒都為了誇大自己，所以爭吵起來，沙說：「像你這樣的呆笨，一天到晚只會躺在地上，河邊，你看我多麼地自由，飛來飛去，好不得意」</p>
<p>泥不服氣地說：「你又有什麼得意？風大哥叫你西，你就不敢東，叫你東，你就不敢西；受了人家的支配，做了人家的奴隷，還有什麼寫意？又像你們的同伴，都是分散的，各歸各的，你瞧我們多麼有團結的力量啊！」沙聽了，沒有話可以回答。</p>
<p>聰明的小朋友請你們把有小黑点的地方細心塗滿就能够知道這是誰？　張靜欲画誌</p>
<h3>康元玩具徵文父母之部第一名　我的孩子與康元玩具</h3>
<p>— 方文瑜</p>
<p>四年前的一個春天，風和日暖，島語花香，引起了我們郊遊之興。於是我們合家約了D的一家到龍華去看桃花。聽說遊玩去，孩子們都很高興，但是雁兒剛出過痧子，吹不得風，看見我們許多人去，他却獨自留在家裏，當然非常難過。但是為了生病也沒有辦法，他就與我講條件，要求我回家時送他一件具。</p>
<p>我履行我的諾言，遊畢歸來時，就獨自灣到國貨公司去買了一隻康元廠出品的跳蛙。同到家裏，我一聲不響地把發條開了放在地板上，那蛙兒就卜卜卜的跳來跳去，眞像活的一般。雁兒看了只是拍手叫好。我說這是在龍華田裏捉回來的，他就怪我為何不多捉幾隻來。</p>
<p>蛙兒跳了一刻停止了，我就拿起來敎雁兒開了發條，雁兒還是半信半疑不敢動。這引得他哥哥虹兒只是懊惱跟我們去。他說，早知道如此，他也情願留在家裏？可以拿一樣有趣的東西玩玩了。</p>
<p>後來我看虹兒實在羨慕得他弟弟可憐，而雁兒偏不肯把那蛙取出來玩，我就去買了一架康元廠的汽車給虹兒。他也歡喜得很一天到晚的伏在地板上開汽車嘴裏喊着：「嗚嗚嗚嗚汽車來了，讓開讓開！」</p>
<p>八一三戰事起了，衛國的英雄，時在空中發威。孩子們只要聽見軋的聲音，就要舉起頭來看，頻頻的拍手歡呼不憶，尤其是那次轟炸出雲艦，更引起孩子們的羨慕心。</p>
<p>我去買了一架飛機給虹兒，一枝發火機關槍給雁兒，那些也是康元廠的出品。誰知道他們却一天到晚打架，不是雁兒　說他哥哥開了飛機轟轟轟的這了嚇他，就是虹兒哭了來吿訴我他弟弟用機關槍開了打他，我就常常官司審不淸。</p>
<p>一天，他們又爭執起來，雁兒跑來告訴我，玩具都給虹兒弄壞了。他要虹兒賠，虹兒不肯。我就問虹兒怎樣把玩具弄壞的？據虹兒說，他不知飛機為什麼會動，機關槍為甚麼會發火，和靑蛙為甚麼會跳，他就逐件的拆開來喋個究竟，那知破壞容易建設難。聽兒看到他所心愛的玩具破哥哥弄壞了，就要他賠，因此遂生了爭執。我知道了他們的原因，再看到那些拆散了的玩具零件，一方面沉得虹兒的好廳心，是孩子本能的表現，我們應該好好地利用牠，引導牠，一方面覺得雁兒的要他賠償，也是名正方，因此我就幫局虹兒費了一個下午的辰光，再把機個拆散了的玩具裝配起來：靑蛙能卜卜卜的再跳，發火機關槍又格格格的射出火花，飛機的輪盤又轉動起來，雁兒笑了，虹兒更加快活。</p>
<p>在工作的時候，他們都聚精會神里幫同我裝配，同時我吿訴蛙兒能跳，飛機能動，和機關槍能够發火的原理；我又吿訴他們不怕破壞，最怕破壞了不能建設的道理。看到他們四隻明亮亮的小眼睛盯牢着我，我知道他們對於我所說的話多少有些領司。從此以後，他們對於康元玩具了解得更寫親切了一點。我很感謝康元玩具給予我的孩子以切實的敎育與訓練。</p>
<p>最後，我還得有一點竟見貢獻給康元廠，曾記得有位日本回國的朋友帶給我一隻日本的兒童玩具！時辰鐘，那隻時辰鏡的玩具是各件分開的，另有裝配的圖形和說說明，兒童可以按着圖形和說明去目行裝配，裝配完成　只要用了發條，牠就能滴答滴答的走着，那是何等有意義的一種玩具呵！我想假使康　廠能有這種種玩具應市，不一定是時辰鐘，其餘如汽車，飛機等，都能把各種零件拆開了附着裝配的圖形和說明發售，兒童自行去裝配，一方向敎授兒童以機械的常識，一方面訓練兒童小肌肉的運用，那更是何等有義的一回事啊！</p>

<h3>「羣英喋血記」</h3>
<p>— 莫野</p>
<p>革命是一件多魔艱辛的工作，它會遭遇到對建制度頑强的搏繫，它會殘酷地設下許多陷阱，要你去投降，自行毀滅。故，我們的革命行動，決不是喊幾聲口號，寫幾張標語所可能的事。它需要犧牲，灌溉，才能在貧療的土地上長出燦爛奇葩！</p>
<p>是事實，俄羅斯的人民，含着淚，忍受着一切，在苦難的生活下鬥爭。殘酷，陰暗，殺戮，沙皇以及一切貴族階級，憑藉着這些毒辣的手段，使行着最卑劣的舉動，做了幾千萬大衆的劊子手。我們看過「普格喬」，心頭烯燒着怒火！我們也曾流着淚，在激昂，憤懣的心情下，看「夏伯陽」；觀「女壯士」那描述着的可憐，悲慘，凄厲的生活。</p>
<p>同樣的是歷史電影，他們是通過了進步的觀點，站在高一級的立塲上，用最悲壯的事實，敎育着後一代的人，啟事後生者鬥爭的策略與方法。</p>
<p>是一頁鬥爭的史詩，是一首贊頌革命的進曲！「羣英喋血記」無疑地是能受之無愧的。它較之「普格喬」更多地說明了鬥爭失販的原因，它此「夏伯陽」更努力地描述了無產陛級英勇的鬥爭過程！</p>
<p>編劇者運用着電影的特殊便利，給予這位主人翁—史吉邦·拉靜，那是一個出身低微的兵卒，深刻地描劃出這一位偉大的人物。在革命的過程中，唯有無產者是最堅毅的羣衆，他們所維繫着是一顆正義，赤誠為民族解放而鬥爭的決心。</p>
<p>在這一部片子裏，看見了羣衆的力量，民衆的傾向。導演有着非常優秀的技巧，他强調了史吉邦·拉靜意志的堅決，批判了無計劃的行動會招來失販；尤以結束處，以彼得洛二人的面部肌肉繫張，羣衆的垂下頭來流淚，反襯出民衆對這位英雄的殉難，是如何的悼念着。</p>
<p>眞的，這是一幅壯麗，雄偉，粗擴的巨畫！</p>

<p>張蒼虬聽背後許靖已中暗器而倒，雖欲回救，然而心中大怒，愈不肯放鬆敵人，把脚一繫，追趕上去，喝道：「狗盜胆敢暗器傷人，今晚你上天我他要趕上天，入地我了要追下地，想逃到那裏去？」那人一邊跑，一邊仍不答話，一扭身又是一枝袖箭向他胸口飛來。張蒼虬把寶刀望下一撩，早把袖箭打落在地。遂又說道：「你有幾多袖箭，只管放將來便了。」那人見兩箭射他不中，也有些驚慌，正要放第三枝箭時，不料在一塊石上一絆，忍不住跌將下去。張蒼虬大喜，躥至那人身前，舉刀砍下。但那人忽使一個鯉魚打挺，一躍而起，一鍾反向張蒼虬腰裏打來。張蒼虬砍了個空，一鍾已至腰際，祇得乘勢又向前一跳，躱過這了一錘，返轉身又是一刀，向那人下三路掃來。兩人重又殺在一起，張蒼虬大有誓欲得而甘心之意，一步也不肯放鬆。那人手中祇有了一柄錘，又怕再被張蒼虬的寶刀削傷，所以勉强鬥了十數合，又向前面官道上逃去。張蒼虬擒他不住，氣得無名火冒，連忙追趕上去。暗想這廝夜行工夫和跳躍之技果然不錯，不要被他逃去了，我怎樣還去見許靖？且不知許靖受了傷又怎樣了？一邊想，一邊追，看看前面已望得見雉堞，官道東邊有一座較大莊院，一帶曲曲團牆，偈是個大戶人家。那人跑至莊後，聳身一躍，已上圖牆，飄身落下去了。張蒼虬想原來這裏是個盜蔞賊窩，那廝逃進去了，我旣已到此，不管他虎火穴龍潭，也要追進去的，所以他跟着一躍也到了牆上。（第二章完）</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Broadcast Speech This Morning: US Decides to Increase Aid to China; Public Opinion in Various States Changes, Becoming Increasingly Tough; Chongqing Newspaper Urges Close Cooperation Among China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the US aid program to China is proceeding smoothly. He indicated that the government is currently considering increasing aid. A reporter asked President Roosevelt what kind of enemy the armaments sent to China were intended to resist. The President replied that this question had not been considered. The reporter's question was obviously prompted by rumors of friction between General Chiang Kai-shek and the Chinese Communists. President Roosevelt also stated that he hoped to leave Washington between March 17th and 29th for a short vacation, and believed he would go to Florida or the Gulf of Mexico for fishing. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt will deliver a national broadcast tonight at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. The President is the guest of honor at the dinner. He will speak from 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM New York time (9:30 AM to 10:00 AM Shanghai Daylight Saving Time on Sunday). (Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt will broadcast to the nation tonight, telling the people how he will exercise the powers granted by the Lend-Lease Act. The President will speak at the White House Correspondents' Annual Dinner. Among those attending will be British Ambassador Lord Halifax, former Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie, cabinet members, and members of the diplomatic corps. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to a poll released today, since February of this year, attitudes toward Japan and Germany have become increasingly tough in all sectors of the United States. The number of people who opposed war with Japan if necessary to stop its southward expansion has decreased. Such a sudden change in the American people's attitude towards Japan within a month is considered extremely important by observers, who believe that Matsuoka's trip to Berlin may be a prelude to Japan's implementation of new policies in the Far East. According to the poll, the American people oppose Japan's southward advance for two main reasons: first, the United States has too much at stake in the Pacific to easily allow Japan to gain a stronger foothold; second, Japan is an old hand at plunder and aggression, just like Hitler. According to the survey results, the anti-Japanese attitude in the western states is extremely tough, with 53% advocating taking the risk of war with Japan. (14th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Newspapers are commenting on Matsuoka's trip to Europe. The Yishi Bao concludes by advocating three points: (1) China, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia should establish a military alliance in the Pacific; (2) China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should cooperate closely to sanction the Axis powers; (3) Britain and the United States should at least establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union similar to those between Germany and the Soviet Union. It also states that for the sake of the future of democratic nations, it is not enough to merely lift the moral embargo against the Soviet Union, the meetings between Cripps and Vyshinsky are not enough, and the joint defense of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia is not enough. Using all means to prevent Japan and the Soviet Union from approaching is still not enough. The most important and convenient way is only the above three methods. The Saodang Bao reports that Matsuoka's trip to Europe is to promote a German-Soviet peace, hoping to thereby escape Japan's obligations to the Axis alliance, while also hoping to use black market trading to end the Sino-Japanese War. Although his intentions are painstaking, his awkward situation will not elicit sympathy from Europeans. The Shishi Xinbao observes that Japan is using its southward expansion strategy as capital to bargain with its allies, but the result of trying to strengthen the Axis is likely to destroy the Axis. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Some US War Supplies Bound for Britain Will Also Be Transferred</p>
<p>Washington - The US program to fully aid democratic nations is proceeding at an accelerated pace. The first batch of goods to aid Britain under the Lend-Lease Act has already been shipped. The United States is now taking various steps internally to increase the rate of production of national defense goods. Officials are proceeding to establish a supreme mediation body to investigate labor disputes, so as not to hinder the production of armaments. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson announced yesterday that the shipment of US war materials to Britain has already begun. The "Lend-Lease Act" authorizes the rapid transfer of $1.3 billion worth of war materials and supplies to democratic nations resisting aggression. At the same time, President Roosevelt told White House reporters that the news that the United States had transferred ships to Britain was not true. However, he said that some ships might be transferred to Britain in the future. The President said that any country resisting aggression could receive US aid under the "Lend-Lease Act." He pointed out that Turkey and Yugoslavia are also eligible to receive US aid, but he had not received a report on aid to Turkey. The President continued that aid to Ireland was not being considered. He said that Spain urgently needs food, but the United States must be sure that the food shipped to Spain will not be transferred elsewhere. The President called for practical measures to be taken for the entire food relief program. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>London - British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced that the Minister of Shipping, Sir Arthur Salter, will soon depart for the United States to discuss the issue of US ship aid to Britain. Also, the Minister of Food, Lord Woolton, has dispatched a delegation led by Brandt to the United States to discuss the issue of food supplies. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt said yesterday that no decision had been made regarding the continued transfer of warships to Britain. The rumor that 100 warships had already been transferred is not true. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Governor of Hong Kong Returns to Post, Discusses the Overall Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - The Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Geoffry Northcote, has returned from England after his sick leave. According to his interview with a reporter, Britain's belief in final victory is growing stronger every day. Looking back at last year, we suffered major blows in France and Belgium, but now we have fully recovered. Seeing our repeated victories in Africa, we are now able to attack the enemy. Furthermore, we are gradually able to overcome the threat of night-raid bombers, piracy ships, and submarines. We are confident that we will eventually achieve complete victory. When asked about the overall situation in the Far East, the Governor replied that he believed it had greatly stabilized in the past few weeks. Although Hong Kong is prepared to deal with any contingency, it still hopes to continue friendly relations with its neighbors in the Pacific. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Britain Will Accelerate Assistance to China, Building the Yunnan-Burma Railway</h3>
<p>Chongqing - It is reported that Britain, in order to aid China, will build a railway from Lashio in Burma to the Chinese border, and will accelerate assistance to China in building the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Burma Road (from Kunming to Lashio). All parties here today expressed warm welcome to the above news. Well-informed sources pointed out that China has already started construction from the Kunming terminus, and currently uses about 10 to 15 miles of railway west of Kunming. In the northeast of Kunming, there is also 100 miles of railway heading towards Guiyang. The railway from Lashio to the border may shorten the transportation route, but it is said here that the greatest benefit of the road is to save fuel, because a large part of the cargo on the current highway is used to transport gasoline. Extending the railway to the border line will reduce the amount of gasoline carried and shorten the cargo transport route. It is learned that the Chinese section of the road will burn coal produced in China, which will greatly help the overall transport capacity of the road. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan and the Dutch East Indies Continue Negotiations</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to Japanese sources in Batavia, Japanese representative Yoshizawa met with Van Couk, Director of the Economic Affairs Bureau of the Dutch East Indies. Because this meeting was held at the same time as the talks between the Japanese Consul General and Hogestralden, it has attracted considerable attention. It is heard that what the Japanese Consul General and Hogestralden discussed were the details of the proposed economic agreement between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Strictly Adopt a Centralized System</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Reliable sources say that in the near future, Japan will face a more stringent centralized rule. The "Imperial Rule Assistance Association," which was formed after the government dissolved all political parties last year, will begin to take important steps in early April to bring the country under a one-party dictatorship. This movement will, in principle, imitate the Axis countries, and will be led by Prime Minister Konoe. In this regard, the Asahi Shimbun stated that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will merge various organizations for "developing Asia" on April 3 to form the Greater East Asia League, with Konoe as chairman. The purpose of the merger is to initiate a national movement and cooperate with officials from the Army, Navy, and the China Affairs Bureau to establish a government that supports the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Konoe Reports on Diplomacy in the Diet</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Konoe and Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi explained the recent Thai-Vietnamese peace negotiations and other diplomatic developments to the Diet today. This explanation was given in closed-door meetings of both houses of the Diet specially convened. The Japanese Army and Navy ministers also reported on the latest developments in the war against China. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Emperor of Japan is scheduled to meet with General Nishio, former commander of the China Expeditionary Army, on Sunday. At that time, Nishio will report on the general situation in China. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Open a Tokyo-Changchun Air Route</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japan Airlines will open a direct air route between Tokyo and Changchun on Sunday, a total of 1,550 kilometers in eight hours, with one refueling stop along the way. This new route, compared with the current route through Korea, can be shortened by one hour. It is now scheduled to fly twice a week, with a fare of 200 Japanese yen. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Yosuke Flies to Harbin; Moscow Prepares to Receive Him</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - A dispatch from Changchun states that Matsuoka Yosuke arrived in Taiqiu at 2:36 PM today. Matsuoka flew to Harbin again at 4:00 PM by plane. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is about to arrive here. Preparations have already been made here yesterday to receive him. German Ambassador to Japan, Wörmann, is coming here from Manchuria to accompany Matsuoka to Berlin. As for whether Matsuoka will have the possibility of discussing matters with Stalin or other Soviet government officials, officials remain silent. At the same time, it is heard that Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Lieutenant General Tatekawa, hosted a grand banquet at his official residence. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and other senior Soviet government officials attended the banquet. It is rumored that Matsuoka will also go to London and Paris, but Tokyo officials have denied this. (International News Service, 15th)</p>
<p>London - French sources here reported yesterday that since January of this year, a mixed Soviet-Japanese committee of five people has been studying ways to stabilize Soviet-Japanese relations. It is heard that the first step towards a non-aggression pact is to revise the Treaty of Portsmouth. That treaty was signed by Japan and the Soviet Union in the United States after the Russo-Japanese War, and is now considered outdated. It is claimed that Japan is very willing to take this step. It is rumored that it is easy to get the Soviet Union to change its attitude towards Chongqing and to redraw the border of Manchuria. It is rumored that Japan needs a ten-year pact and will turn Inner Mongolia, Rehe, and Chahar into buffer zones. (International News Service, 15th)</p>
<p>Vatican City - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will arrive in Rome on the 3rd or 4th of next month. It is heard that in addition to meeting with Italian authorities, he will also take the opportunity to pay his respects to Pope Pius XII. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Expands Fujian Coast Blockade Line, Implemented at 11 PM Today</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Admiral Shimada, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, announced today that for military strategic necessities, the blockade line on the Fujian coast has been expanded. From 11:00 PM on March 16th, the sea area between Heitou (translated meaning) and Siyang (translated sound) coast, and the sea area between Haitan (translated sound) and Teru Island (translated sound), the Haitan Strait, and the sea area around Haitan Island are prohibited from ships coming and going. The Haitan Strait is located between Haitan Island and the Chinese mainland. At the same time, Shimada also instructed the Japanese Consul General to forward this matter to the Chinese diplomatic representative and the Chinese Customs. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>From Now On, Chinese Going to Japan Must Carry Passports</h3>
<p>Guangzhou - According to reports, from now on, Chinese going to Japan must carry passports signed by the Japanese consular authorities. Civilians must find a reliable store or government official to guarantee them. Students and officials do not need guarantors. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Increased Fertile Land in Free China Area</h3>
<p>Chongqing - As a result of the implementation of irrigation projects in the Free China area since the outbreak of war, 2.165 million mu of barren land have been turned into fertile land. It is expected that in one or two years, the canal construction projects currently surveyed and planned can be completed, and more than 2.7 million mu of fertile land can be added. (Havas World News Agency, 15th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Profit and Loss Account of the Axis Powers</h3>
<p>What is claimed to be a spring offensive, is often referred to by the Axis powers as the March offensive. Today is already March 16th; whether it is a spring offensive or a "March offensive", it has not yet been realized; this has wasted at least half a month of precious time. Matsuoka Yosuke's trip to Europe, if not a diplomatic smokescreen used to divert attention and conceal military operations, is at least sufficient to prove that the Axis powers' preparatory work before launching an offensive is not yet fully in place; therefore, whether the so-called "March offensive" is going to fail again will be revealed in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>If we calculate the profit and loss account for the Axis powers since the defeat of France in June last year, the positive aspects worth mentioning include the formation of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance, Germany's bloodless occupation of Romanian and Bulgarian territory, and Japan's acquisition of some not-yet-fully-defined advantages in Vietnam. However, the negative aspects that can be written about in detail are numerous: Italy's defeat in the Balkan Peninsula and on the African continent has swept away the prestige of the Blackshirt comrades. Not only does Hitler not receive the slightest help from Mussolini, but he is instead greatly dragged down by him; this is one. Although the defeated Vichy government and the Spanish dictator Franco have been threatened and enticed by Germany in an attempt to force them to join the Axis and jointly fight against Britain, the attitude of France and Spain has remained consistently ambivalent up to now. Not only have they not jumped straight into the fire, but Britain and the United States still have room for competition in diplomacy towards them, which makes Hitler dare not coerce them too much; this is two. Although Japan has spared no effort to successfully orchestrate the scene of Thailand and Vietnam being unified, it has not actually occupied any major rights and interests sufficient to influence the situation in the South Pacific. However, it has startled the snake, prompting the democratic countries to implement joint defense in the Far East, which makes Japan's southward advance have to be more cautious, hesitating again and again; this is three. The reconciliation between the Soviet Union and Japan is still vague, and German-Soviet relations have undergone subtle changes due to the Balkan issue; the Soviet Union's "friendly neutrality", although imperative to contend for, is still the factor that the Axis powers are most deeply wary of. In the future, a little carelessness could lead to a complete change of the global situation; this is four. Apart from this, the active attitude and actions of the United States are the most unfavorable point for the Axis powers. In the past, the United States was still limited to spiritually supporting the democratic countries, but since the defeat of France, through President Roosevelt's re-election and up to the recent passing of the "Lend-Lease Act", US diplomacy has clearly evolved from spiritual support to material assistance. After signing the Lend-Lease Act, President Roosevelt immediately asked Congress to allocate $7 billion and declared that "any country resisting aggression can receive US aid under the Lend-Lease Act, and even Turkey and Yugoslavia are eligible to receive US aid" (United Press report yesterday). This is of course a fatal blow to the Axis powers, and it is the biggest loss suffered in the past nine months; this is five.</p>
<p>The above is what is said to be the salient points. Please further elaborate on the gains and losses of the Axis powers based on the recent facts that have occurred.</p>
<p>First, after occupying Bulgaria, Hitler failed to immediately break the relationship between the British and Turkish alliance, nor did he subdue Greece and force it to give up its resistance. Even the issue of Yugoslavia's entry into the alliance, which initially seemed as easy as picking something out of a pocket, is now seeing twists and turns, unable to be realized smoothly. Although it is said that the southern country has shown signs of surrender to some extent, and sooner or later it will inevitably follow in the footsteps of Romania and Bulgaria, the delay of more than ten days has at least prevented Hitler from launching an offensive against Greece or other areas before the US Congress passes the Lend-Lease Act. This setback, this loss, for the Axis powers is truly difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>Second, regarding Matsuoka's mission to Europe, recent commentators have made many analyses. Regardless of whether his purpose is to strengthen the Axis collusion or to promote Soviet-Japanese rapprochement, the fact that there are still things that need to be "strengthened" or must be "promoted" shows that the joint offensive by Germany, Italy, and Japan that the world was previously worried about has not yet matured at this time. What can be known is that Germany is eager for Japan to advance southward to contain Britain and the United States, but before advancing southward, Japan still has demands on Hitler; the main conditions are nothing more than two: one is to receive military assistance from Germany, and the other is to have Germany guarantee the Soviet Union's friendly neutrality. If these two points cannot be achieved, Hitler may not be willing to "risk his life" for him even if he forces it a little harder. According to news from Vichy, Matsuoka's trip will request 1,500 aircraft from Germany, which is very possible; however, before Matsuoka's trip has achieved any concrete results, the British and American sides have already become more vigilant as a result. It is heard that Britain is considering expanding aid to China, the United States has approved a large amount of funding for the fortification of the Pacific, and President Roosevelt yesterday announced to the press: "The US aid program to China is proceeding smoothly, and the government is currently considering increasing aid". These are also direct answers to Matsuoka's visit to Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the actions of the Axis powers are not only insufficient to scare off the democratic countries, but instead encourage the democratic countries, causing them to make bigger and firmer decisions and forcing them to seek effective countermeasures. If the three-nation alliance cannot come up with any new tricks and continues its unfavorable state of "more losses than gains" over the past nine months, then it will be seen that the democratic front, with the strong support of the United States, will change from defense to offense, and will soon transform and enter a dominant position.</p>

<h3>China News Association to Hold Inaugural Meeting in Chongqing Today, President Chiang Sends Special Telegram of Encouragement</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The China News Association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the 16th. President Chiang sent a special telegram of encouragement, the original text of which is as follows: To all members of the China News Association, Upon the establishment of your association, marking the beginning of a nationwide organization for the news industry in our country, I am deeply gratified. The work of a journalist cannot be compared to ordinary professions because their tasks are equivalent to education, and their influence affects the rise and fall of the nation's destiny. Therefore, the career of a journalist should not be regarded merely as a means of livelihood but must have a higher purpose. If the news industry is compared to education, then the entire country is their classroom, and all readers are influenced by them. Moreover, travelers from all directions rely on it to observe national opinions, and scholars of later generations rely on it to examine the history of the country. In terms of space, it connects both internal and external affairs; in terms of time, it connects the past and present. Therefore, journalists must hold themselves to a high standard and diligently cultivate themselves, not abandoning their profession due to difficulties, nor ceasing their efforts due to obstacles. What journalists rely on to maintain their lasting efforts are the aspirations to save the country and the world, and the trend of daily renewal. However, a solo string cannot create a beautiful melody, so it requires collective wisdom and effort to broaden their aspirations. Studying alone without friends leads to limited knowledge, so mutual encouragement and learning are necessary to ensure the continuous progress of their endeavors. Some say that China's news industry has made great progress during the war of resistance and national reconstruction, but compared to modern countries, it still lags far behind. I, Zhongzheng, believe that our backwardness lies only in the material conditions of technology and equipment. As for the ambition to serve the country in times of difficulty and the spirit of courageously rushing to righteousness, we have never been behind others. Since the war of resistance and national reconstruction, our news industry has become increasingly aware of the common national policies and has become increasingly firm in supporting the common national cause. At this time of concentrated will and power, I hope that the news industry will unite, and all colleagues across the country will strive for a good opportunity to advance the news industry. Your association is a union of news researchers and practitioners. I hope you will uphold the highest guiding principle of the Three Principles of the People, continuously study journalism, improve the news industry, and strive to achieve these goals. Zhongzheng dares to believe that the great cause of China's national revolution will be vigorously promoted by the enthusiastic advocacy of the news industry, and that its complete success will be achieved through the continued struggle of our news industry. Promoting the ethics of the news industry and maintaining the honor of the news industry are the aspirations of you all, and also the good fortune of the nation. There are myriad tasks in the national reconstruction. We must work diligently and with one heart to fulfill our great responsibilities. I have high hopes for your association. Chiang Kai-shek, deleted. (15th Telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The China News Association is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting on the morning of the 16th. President Chiang recently sent a special telegram to the association to congratulate and encourage them, saying, in brief, that some believe that although China's news industry has made great progress during the war of resistance and national reconstruction, it still lags far behind modern countries. He, however, believes that China's backwardness lies only in the material conditions of technology and equipment. As for the ambition to serve the country in times of difficulty and the spirit of courageously rushing to righteousness, we have never been behind others. He also said that he believes that the great cause of China's national revolution will be vigorously promoted by the enthusiastic advocacy of the news industry, and that its complete success will be achieved through the continued struggle of the news industry.

<h3>U.S. House Passes Massive Naval Budget to Strengthen Pacific Defenses and Build Six Battlecruisers</h3>
<p>Washington: Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a naval budget of $3,415,620,000 without objection and sent it to the Senate. It is believed that this amount is sufficient to deter aggression by the Axis powers in Europe and Asia. Of this amount, $1,515,000,000 is a continuation of the funds to complete the two-ocean navy, and $434,000,000 is for the construction of air force equipment. Most of the funds will be used to strengthen Pacific defenses. Nevada Democratic Congressman Scrugham advocated that this bill should be passed immediately, regardless of aid to Britain, and stated that unless the United States has a large national defense, the voracious Axis powers of Europe and Asia will attack the United States. If Britain is defeated, there is an immediate danger of invasion. Enemies from the Caribbean islands and Mexico, equipped with modern bombing equipment, can inflict heavy damage on American cities and cause suffering to the people. As for the allocation of these funds, $31,939,000 is for coastal engineering construction in Hawaii, of which $22,438,111 is used in Hawaii alone, including the construction of bulletproof air-raid shelters, power plants, coastal stone walls and jetties, new hangars, aircraft runways, and armories. This amount does not include the cost of maintaining the fleet, aircraft, artillery, and naval equipment, but it does include defensive works from Pearl Harbor to the Philippines, Singapore, and southern Samoa. In addition, Guam, Samoa, Johnston Island, and Palmyra Island have all been allocated funds. The funds for Guam are $1 million for expanding the seaplane base, $187,000 for constructing military roads, and $250,000 for improving the power plant. At the same time, the Philippines has also been allocated $150,000 for defense equipment, $100,000 for constructing a power plant for the Dewey dry dock, and $65,000 for constructing a naval fuel depot and oil pipeline at Fort Sanlay. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington: The House yesterday unanimously passed the $3,446,000,000 naval appropriations bill, which includes funds for the construction of new-type battlecruisers. However, the new-type warships were not mentioned during the House's one-hour and twenty-minute debate. The new-type warships were first mentioned in the forms submitted by the U.S. Navy to the House Naval Affairs Committee. Committee Chairman Vinson said that the United States' decision to build new-type warships was not influenced by Japan's naval shipbuilding program. The new-type warships are fast and equipped with heavy artillery, making them particularly suitable for pursuing maritime commerce raiders and conducting rapid naval bombardments. According to informed sources, Japan is also building this type of new-type warship, and two super-large cruisers have already begun service. The Navy declined to release any details of the new warships. The new warships were ordered in September last year when Congress passed the two-ocean navy bill and mentioned 27,000-ton cruisers. The firepower of this type of cruiser is almost equal to that of the largest battleships, but the speed is far greater than that of battleships because the armor plate is smaller. Experts here believe that the new-type cruisers will be equipped with 14-inch guns and reach a speed of 32 knots, with each ship costing $43 million. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to yesterday's news, the U.S. Navy is building six battlecruisers. The Washington Post specifically commented on this matter, believing that this move is equivalent to a response to Japan because it has recently been reported that Japan is also building this type of warship. The battlecruisers being built in the United States are the latest style and are completely different from the past styles. They are extremely powerful and have very high speeds. This is part of the $7 billion two-ocean navy plan. The cost of building battlecruisers has not been announced by the Navy authorities, but it is estimated that each ship will cost as much as $70 million, which is equivalent to the cost of each 35,000-ton displacement battleship.

<h3>Thailand to Reach Understanding with Britain and the United States and Will Not Recognize Japanese Hegemony in East Asia</h3>
<p>Washington: According to the New York Herald Tribune, after the signing of the Thai-Vietnamese agreement and the exchange of notes between Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam, Warawan, the chief Thai representative, issued a statement stating that the Thai government cannot recognize Japan's Greater East Asia Doctrine. Thailand will conduct relations with other countries on the basis of its own established national policy and the principle of reciprocity. This statement is roughly the same as the previous statement by the Dutch East Indies not recognizing Japan's Greater East Asia Doctrine, which is equivalent to refusing to recognize Japan's superior position in East Asia and its so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." It is heard that Warawan also stated that Thailand is prepared to reach an understanding with Britain and the United States, allowing it not to enter into any treaty with Japan that is harmful to democratic countries.

<h3>Italian Troops Massively Reinforced, Another Full-Line Counterattack Fails, Greek Troops Charge and Fight with Unstoppable Force, Five Divisions of Blackshirt Warriors Lose Half Their Numbers</h3>
<p>Athens: Athens Radio Station stated that yesterday Italian troops in Albania launched a counterattack along a 17-mile front, during which a large unit was completely annihilated. Reinforcements from Italy were deployed to the battle, repeatedly launching counterattacks with intense force, supported by artillery and aircraft which carried out intensive bombing. The first counterattack was reportedly fierce, but it was met with a severe blow by the Greek troops and ended in total failure. More reserves were then deployed to launch another attack, which was also repelled. At multiple locations, the Greek troops, after the Italian troops collapsed, immediately seized the opportunity to charge and capture the positions to which the Italian troops had retreated. A Greek Information Department statement stated that, according to Italian prisoners, five Italian divisions have lost half their numbers in the last five days. Many high-ranking Italian commanders have been captured. This is due to Mussolini forcing them to lead the operations by being at the forefront. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Southern Capital City: Although the weather on the Italian-Greek front is harsh, fierce fighting still occurred yesterday afternoon. According to reports received, the fighting between Tajirini and Krisula, north of Pograt, was reportedly intense. The Italian troops attacked the Greek positions with light and heavy artillery, supported by aircraft. Fierce fighting also occurred near the village of Doussari. (Haitong, 15th)</p>

<p>Athens: A government spokesman declared yesterday that the fifth day of the Italian spring offensive was not more successful than the previous days. The spokesman said that after dusk on Wednesday evening, the Italian troops launched a fierce attack on the Greek troops' 4,000-foot mountain position in the central area, but were defeated and retreated with heavy losses. The Greek troops captured countless military supplies. The newly added Italian troops attacked the same stronghold on Friday, but were forced to retreat under the Greek artillery fire. The Ministry of Military Affairs announced, "Today (Friday), after the enemy artillery increased preparations and was assisted by fighters and bombers, they re-launched a fierce attack on the same front, but the Italian troops on all lines failed and suffered heavy losses. The Greek troops rose up to counterattack and captured several prisoners." (United Press, 15th)</p>

<h3>Germany Exerts Effort to Win Over Southern Country, Negotiations Still in Stalemate, Southern Country's Attitude Remains Firm, Foreign Minister's Trip to Berlin Postponed</h3>
<p>Zurich: According to news from diplomatic circles in the Southern Capital City received here, the situation between Germany and the Southern Country is becoming increasingly chaotic. The Southern Country's Foreign Minister and Korvezh have postponed their trip to Berlin until next week. According to informed sources, Germany insists that Southern Prime Minister Schwikovich must also attend, but Schwikovich is not eager to go to Germany again. This is the reason for the postponement of the meeting. Diplomats have confirmed the firm attitude of Yugoslavia in its talks with Germany. According to Yugoslav sources here, the Southern Army Headquarters continues to control the situation, rejecting any proposals from Germany involving the Southern Army, and opposing the conclusion of any agreement that would allow German troops to enter the country or obtain any military bases of any nature. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Southern Capital City: The Southern Country has not yet made any decision on the German proposals, which will inevitably postpone Hitler's timetable for action in the Balkan Peninsula. According to the Nazi plan, the Southern German agreement should be signed on Tuesday, and then Greece should be attacked immediately. However, politicians in the Southern Country have doubts about some of the clauses in the agreement proposed by Germany, believing that these clauses are actually equivalent to the Southern Country joining the Axis Pact. It is generally believed that the temporary Southern German stalemate is due to the Southern Country's cautious handling of matters and the German diplomats' extremely subtle handling of the situation. The Nazis obviously want to obtain the greatest concessions at the lowest risk. It is rumored that Germany is currently sending additional aircraft squadrons to Bulgaria and is gathering fast boats and submarines in the Aegean Sea for use, which shows the importance Germany attaches to the war in Greece. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Basel: The "Basler Zeitung" correspondent in Berlin telegraphed that the German Foreign Ministry is maintaining absolute silence on all political issues, including those concerning Yugoslavia. It is believed that negotiations between Germany and the Southern Country are currently in progress. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>British Troops Continue to Win on Abyssinian Front, Advance Forces Approach Debrarmakos, Air Force Active and Heavily Damages Italian Base</h3>
<p>Cairo: A recent communique announced that British forces continue to win in Abyssinia. After the patriotic Abyssinian army severely damaged the Italian troops retreating from Boi, they reached the outskirts of Debrarmakos. British troops have occupied Asosa and are advancing along the Mainy Highway. In Italian Somaliland, the Abyssinian army has occupied Jawelo and is pursuing the Italian troops retreating towards Nicchiri. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London: News received here today said that the Italian troops have reportedly concentrated 20,000 troops outside Debrarmakos in order to save the city from being captured by the advancing Abyssinian patriotic army. However, given the heavy casualties and the large number of deserters, the Italian troops are likely to abandon the city, cross the river, and join the troops defending the Abyssinian capital. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Nairobi: An official communique stated that the British military operations in Abyssinia continue, and the work of clearing enemy troops in Italian Somaliland is gradually being completed. The remaining enemy troops have either been captured or surrendered. The British troops are advancing deeply and are strictly disciplined, so the indigenous people have a new confidence in the British troops. The situation in the captured areas is gradually returning to normal. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Cairo: British Air Force fighters and bombers continue to heavily damage Italian troops in Albania and Africa, while suffering very few losses themselves. This is evident from the recent communique from the British Air Force in the Middle East. The Tripoli naval base and main docks in Libya were heavily bombed by British aircraft on Wednesday night. Bombs landed everywhere in the dock area, causing flames to shoot up and explosions to be heard far away. Road junctions and military buildings east of Tripoli were also bombed. The British Air Force in Eritrea repeatedly bombed and strafed Italian artillery batteries, troop convoys, railway lines, and bridges in Colun. At the same time, the South African Air Force continued to support the advancing central army in Abyssinia. Sasso Frangio Island in the Bay of Valona, Albania, and Vituana Airfield were all bombed by British aircraft on Wednesday night, causing considerable damage. The British aircraft safely returned to their original defenses after completing their missions. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

(Fifteenth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet authorities awarded huge sums of money to scientists. Regarding this matter, the "Pravda" commented, "The authorities' awarding of the Stalin Prize to scientists is an important victory for Soviet culture. The establishment of this prize shows the Soviet state's respect for scientific engineering and cultural talents. Those who receive this prize are the pride of the Soviet Union. Their achievements have made a great contribution to the Soviet Union and the world. The development of Soviet science is due to the solid economic foundation of socialism and the entire policy of the Bolshevik Party government. The Soviet Union has spent huge subsidies in the field of science. The inventions of scientists Kapitsa and artillery expert Glivi have contributed greatly to national defense. In addition, Lychenko's summer sweet potato planting method has also attracted the attention of the Soviet people. In medicine, the President of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences invented a new method to prolong human life, and scientist Fileratov also discovered a medical technique to restore sight to the blind. All of this greatly helps the health of the Soviet people. Among those who won the Stalin Prize, there are many scientists from before the revolution and young scientists created by the Soviet Union. All inventions by scientists from before the revolution have been developed by current young scientists. The Soviet Union now has extremely progressive leadership. Soviet scientists have turned theory into reality. Scientists from various republics have also won the Stalin Prize. In short, this decision by the Soviet authorities to award the Stalin Prize to scientists proves the glorious achievements of the Soviet Union in the field of science in the past six or seven years. Soviet scientists have applied theory to economics and national defense and have completed the tasks assigned to them by the government. In the current imperialist war, most of the culture has been destroyed, but the Soviet Union has shocked the world with its great production and cultural achievements." (Fifteenth, TASS dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tung Wah Abandons Game Midway, Recreation Ground in Unprecedented Chaos, Tung Wah Disagrees with Referee and Abandons Game Midway, Unfortunate Result in First Division Final, Spectators Angry at Unfair Refereeing, Recreation Ground Vandalized</h3>
<p>The First Division League Championship Final between Tung Wah and the Western Police yesterday caused unprecedented chaos in Shanghai football history. The Recreation Ground dog racing track was set on fire and vandalized by spectators. Dog racing cannot be held for the next two days, resulting in losses of tens of thousands of dollars, setting an unprecedented record in Shanghai football matches. During the first half of the match, the Western Police took the lead with a score of 1-0. After Tung Wah scored a goal in the second half, they were scored on twice consecutively by the Western Police. At 25 minutes into the second half, the referee, Kanar, ordered Tai Linjing to leave the field. The entire Tung Wah team disagreed with the decision and abandoned the game together. 20,000 spectators, angry at the unfair refereeing, set fire to and vandalized the Recreation Ground. Police officers from the French Concession used force to disperse the crowd because the spectators did not disperse, resulting in many injuries and bloodshed. This was an extremely unfortunate incident for a football match.</p>
<p>Western Police Takes the Lead with 3-1</p>
<p>Yesterday's key to the First Division Championship was at the Recreation Ground, packed with over 20,000 spectators, squeezing like sardines. Both teams arrived late, and the match started at 2:40 PM. Referee Kanar ruled that Tai Linjing committed a foul when he drove a ball into the crowd at 30 minutes, and the goal was ruled invalid. Eight minutes later, Western Police's Qi Lihuaite single-handedly scored a goal. At the end of the first half, Tung Wah trailed 0-1. Switching sides to fight again, Adi equalized five minutes later. Subsequently, Willie Huaite and Nuo Gulov successively scored, leading 3-1. Tung Wah counterattacked. Huang Kehou dribbled the ball to the front of the opponent's goal and collided with the opponent. Kanar ruled that Huang committed a foul. Tai Linjing argued with reason. Kanar ruled that Tai should not question the referee and ordered Tai to leave the field. All Tung Wah players were unwilling to continue playing and withdrew from the field. Kanar declared that Tung Wah forfeited the game.</p>
<p>Order in Great Chaos Cannot Be Maintained</p>
<p>Spectators in the north and south stands roared, angered by the unfairness of the referee, inciting public anger, and removed wooden fences from the sides of the stands and threw them into the field. The spectators in the north stand first threw wooden boards and other objects into the field. Chinese and foreign police officers in the field attempted to disperse the spectators by force. Whips and wooden sticks were used, resulting in numerous injuries. Spectators in the south stand also responded, tearing down the railings and entering the field. For a time, order could not be maintained. At that time, there was a pile of straw next to the field, and the spectators set it on fire. Flower pots around were smashed to pieces. The glass windows of the office next to the north stand were almost completely destroyed. Order was in great chaos, and the emotions of the fans were still difficult to restrain. The French Concession police rushed to the scene immediately. Fire trucks were notified and also sent personnel to the scene, using water hoses to spray the spectators and extinguish the flames, avoiding a major disaster. Spectators dispersed in a rush around 5 PM.</p>

<h3>Food: Leveling Rice Prices is Not Difficult, Only Worry is Lack of Determination to Rectify, Looking at the Rice Market to Reiterate that There is No Reason for Rice Prices to Rise, Going to the Source to Observe that There is No Sign of Interruption</h3>
<p>After the public reporting of foreign rice, the market immediately declined, showing that the rise in rice prices is entirely due to artificial hoarding and manipulation, not a natural trend. As long as those in charge have the determination to no longer be deaf and blind, and order large hoarders who hoard and refuse to sell to sell, breaking through sentiment, then the rice market will be cleared up in a matter of moments. Because Shanghai has 2.7 million shi of rice in storage, which is unprecedented since Shanghai had a rice market. Nor is it a place lacking rice. 20,000 shi arrive every day, while sales are actually less than 10,000. Nor is it a place where transportation is interrupted. It is a place where rice arrives every day and there is more than enough in storage. Therefore, leveling rice prices is not difficult, only the lack of determination to rectify is a concern. Therefore, this time, once reported, considerable results have been achieved. If further measures are taken, then rice prices will inevitably gradually return to normal. It should be known that among the 4 or 5 million citizens of Shanghai, how many are not worried about the pressure of life? Therefore, once rice prices rise, the whole city is panicked. Although yesterday's market price did not fall, it was slightly more stable than the previous day. The opening price of small grain rice was 3,400 yuan per 100 bags, then 3,200 yuan, but because large households did not sell and speculators took advantage of small purchases, the closing price returned to 1 or 2 yuan. However, it was still 2 or 3 yuan per bag less than the highest price of the previous market. Number 1 Saigon was only 3,000 yuan and 2,800 yuan per 100 bags, and Number 2 was 3,200 yuan and 3,000 yuan. In addition, rice tea original bags opened at 100 yuan and 98.5 yuan, and broken rice original bags opened at 88 yuan, all 2 yuan less. The total daily transaction was only 5,000 to 6,000 bags because hoarders refused to sell. However, once rice prices are slightly lower, there is a sign of resumption of hoarding, and if the root is not removed, there will be no peace. If only acting as a scare tactic, then those who are punished will be fortunate and unfortunate.</p>
<p>A large amount of imported rice arrives in Shanghai continuously, as reported in this newspaper. The German Deda ship of Hualun Foreign Firm directly loaded from Saigon, with 30,913 bags of foreign rice, 16,310 bags of broken rice, and 9,803 bags of corn. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docked at Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to unload. Yesterday, 440 bags of corn were loaded onto Taikoo Company's Shuntian wheel to Yantai. The Dingsheng wheel also had 535 bags of corn to Yantai today. It is heard that another French ship loaded with 3,048 tons of foreign rice will arrive from Saigon today morning. There is still a large batch on the way to Shanghai. (Zu)</p>
<p>Although thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice are unique, the public sentiment is still affected when the black market for foreign rice slightly stabilizes. Whether it is a shop or a household, no one is willing to rashly import more, so the route is turning sluggish. The owners are forced by the environment, and their willingness to sell is also loose. They are all depreciating prices to sell. Therefore, the closing price, except for thick japonica rice, which is more durable, only dropped by 1 yuan. Thin rice fell by about 2 yuan. The opening price of Chang japonica rice was 126 yuan per shi, Kunshan japonica rice was 124 yuan to 121 yuan, and Qingjiao thin rice was 120 yuan to 119 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice followed the other goods and was tired, dropping by 1 or 2 yuan. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 108 yuan, finally at 104 yuan.</p>
<h3>Although Vermicelli Prices Did Not Fall Significantly, Even With Large Shipments Arriving, Hoarders Still Control</h3>
<p>The vermicelli market was slightly tired yesterday. The reason is that rice prices have returned to loose, and news of vermicelli arriving is endless. It is heard that 270,000 bags of Kem brand vermicelli are unloaded in Hong Kong and are being transported to Shanghai from Hong Kong. Hanyang wheel newly arrived with 47,000 bags of Australian vermicelli with the flower and bird brand etc. It has already unloaded at Taikoo No. 14 godown. Large shipments will definitely arrive next week, so public sentiment is turning lazy. There are quite a few sporadic households following the market to come out. However, large households have always controlled. Although the market did not fall significantly, yesterday the opening price of flower and bird clock tower brand Australian vermicelli was 32.6 yuan, Jinlong brand Kem vermicelli was 31.6 yuan. The flat-selling vermicelli of this factory is still 25 yuan, and there are still no changes to the 5,000 bags being wholesaled every day. There is generally no regular market for wheat.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Prices Are Difficult to Suppress</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the peanut oil market still held the original price. The trend of soybean oil spot goods was slightly soft. Futures, because the regulators intended to reduce the market first, then turned to the original fundamental Japanese merchants to negotiate and sell forward goods. Unexpectedly, external hoarders and hat-style speculators buy when prices are low, causing waves and fluctuations throughout the day. As a result, it was forcibly supported. Compared with the previous day's market, it only recovered 2 jiao. According to statistics, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were made, priced at 118 yuan, 100 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil, priced at 100 yuan, 200 barrels of Dalian oil, priced at 133 yuan (spot silver delivery), and more than 1,200 barrels for April delivery. The lowest price was 135.25 yuan, and the highest price was 137.25 yuan. Also, 728 bags of soybeans and 1,000 pieces of bean cake will be exported to Hong Kong today (16th).</p>
<h3>Finance Exporting Merchants Profiting From It: Tight Foreign Exchange Situation Not Seen to Expand</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed rates showed no change. The gray market for British and American exchange saw a resurgence of tightness, with "scalpers" following suit, making it increasingly crowded. In addition to Chinese speculators, there were also oil trading companies settling accounts. Although the supply from foreign banks was still abundant, the situation was such that supply was outnumbered by demand, leading to a potentially softening trend. As for the transaction process, the opening price in the morning was the lowest, with few transactions conducted at the opening price. As oil trading companies, speculators, and others began settling accounts and short positions were covered, the market gradually tightened, with no rebound until the close. The British pound also contracted, presumably due to foreign exchange intentions between Chase Bank and Chinese banks. Current rates were all quoted at three pence, 328125. The midday close resulted in the spot and forward rates aligning. The US dollar was at $5.40625, softer by 0.015625 compared to the previous day's spot British pound, and the US dollar was tighter by 0.000625.</p>
<p>Also, kerosene settlements</p>
<p>In the morning, with the London big bars, the near-term continued to rise 0.0625, the forward remained unchanged, the New York silver price was still flat, the London raw gold was fixed, the exchange rates for British against US dollars and Shanghai remained unchanged, the US against British dollars was unchanged, against Shanghai it contracted by two cents, and there was no market against France. The central bank's listed rates for various exchanges remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling price in the morning was three pence, 34375 for British gold, and $5.46875 for the US dollar, both flat. After the opening, very few transactions were conducted at the above prices, and speculators and foreign firms came to "scalp" one after another, and the market immediately showed softening. Initially, foreign banks sold a small number of March US dollars to speculators at $5.46875. At 9:30 AM, HSBC's listed rates were announced, all exchanges were flat, and the silver equalization tax was increased by 0.25%. Sterling transactions were also opened at that time. It was first heard that Chinese banks were doing spot trades at three pence, 328125, with a relatively ample potential. Later, American Bank Chase also entered Sterling at three pence, 328125 for April, so under the buying trend of the US dollar, the price softened. It is estimated that oil trading companies settled into this month's US dollar from $5.4375 to 40625. The speculators' appetite was for the US dollar, the same as the above price, and part of it was to cover short positions. However, because exporting merchants had sold from it, in addition to the supply from foreign banks, the position was still wide, and the tight situation did not spread. Until the midday close, spot and forward rates both tended to be consistent, with the British pound at three pence, 328125, and the US dollar at $5.40625, compared to the previous day's closing price, the British pound spot and forward contracted by 0.015625, the US dollar spot was uniquely tight by 0.0625, and the near and far terms softened by 0.03125. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British and American unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th (Saturday) telegram: The foreign exchange market opened flat this morning. British, American, and Japanese exchanges remained unchanged. The Shanghai exchange spot rate dropped by 25 cents to $446.50. At 11:30 AM, it was reported flat, and the Shanghai exchange spot rate rebounded by three yuan to $449.50. The rest remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin exchange rates all contracted</p>
<p>Tianjin, 15th (Saturday) telegram: The foreign exchange market opened tight this morning. The London telegraphic transfer contracted by 0.0625 to three pence, 6875. The New York telegraphic transfer contracted by 0.09375 to $6.0625. The Shanghai exchange rose by 1.75 yuan to 90 yuan. The "Joint Note" gray market rose by 40 cents to 73 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Surges for Five Consecutive Days: Continuing to Advance Towards Peak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market, the cooked raw gray market, the rising trend suddenly expanded, rapidly advancing towards the peak. The price has already flown out of the $6,400 mark. The inquiry is due to the contraction of the commercial exchange rate in Chongqing. Knowing it is absurd, the speculators' opportunity has not been abandoned. They are forcefully "scalping" foreign exchange, causing it to become tight again, so the gold price is also under the buying trend, flying from $6,325 to $6,435, finally seeing a rise of 102 yuan, creating a rising trend that has lasted for five consecutive days. About 10,000 taels were traded in half a day. People from all sides are quite firm. There is no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. The swap from March to April period, sellers Hengji, Hesheng, etc. posted 42-43 yuan to buyers, which was posted by buyers Chengji, etc., making about 2,000 taels. No cash transactions were heard. The price for term delivery was 370 yuan higher earlier, and then 340 yuan higher with buyers. Ornament gold, customs gold, etc. were all flat.</p>
<p>Cooked Raw Jumps More Than One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Since the opening in the morning (ten taels per bar) at 9:15 AM, it was high by 7 yuan, at $6,330. It retreated slightly to $6,325. When it was heard that the US dollar was soft, Hengji, Dafengxiang, and Yongyi Da all came to advance, and the price flew to 65 yuan in the fierce lifting of retail investors, reaching $6,390. Gold shop Chengji came to vigorously sell, and the securities group also vigorously sold, and it immediately saw a retreat to $6,370. The non-child giant short Tianyuan came to cover, and the price flew to 48 yuan again, raising to $6,418, which was sold by Heng Fei and a certain money house, and then retreated to $6,385. When it was heard that the April US dollar was difficult to settle at $5.4375, the rising trend re-ignited, Hengji, Yida, Litai, the securities group, and bill merchants gathered to absorb, and the price flew to 50 yuan again at noon, reaching $6,435. Hengji came back to sell, and the noon closing price was $6,425, a sharp rise of 102 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. According to the April US dollar settlement price of $5.40625, it was $6,441, only pressing 16 yuan. The off-market was depressed after the close, and Xinfeng Yong sold to $6,405, and finally $6,420. There was a fluctuation of 110 yuan in half a day. There is no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. The selling price of the cash gold shop's native gold was 350 yuan higher than the cooked raw term delivery, and the receiving price was 70-80 yuan lower than the selling price. There is no price or market for the current standard gold.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Stands Still</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops, Datonghang and Xintonghang, both still hung at $690, and the receiving price was reduced by 40 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Step Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The cooked raw market price soared, so British, American, and gold pounds each rose by one yuan. British gold bills tended to be fixed, and the market price stood flat. The demand for US gold bills was not scarce, and the market price stepped up. The evening market was as high as $18.25, up 1.5 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong bills stepped up to $4.50. Japanese military tickets continued to rise, and the evening market was as high as $1.93. Korean tickets had uniform supply and demand, and the market price stood flat, and the evening market still stood at $1.58 on the original plate.</p>
<h3>Coal: Tong Deli New Goods Arrive, Continued Increase of Fifteen Yuan</h3>
<p>Tong Deli white coal, after being out of stock, has been silent for a long time. It is heard that thousands of tons have arrived at the port and have been unloaded onto the wharf. Except for unloading old wharf receipts, there is not much left. The company has temporarily suspended ordering for fellow merchants, with current vehicles limited, to prevent hoarding. No. 1, 2, and 3 blocks, the new price is $275 per ton, a continued increase of fifteen yuan. Because the merchants on this street have seen the tide rise, the prices have also increased, it is said.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Still Seen Favorably</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gray market for public bonds surprisingly tended to hover. Although Xinfu has stopped selling, other firms still have sales, and buyers are not as lively as the previous day. Someone pulls when it is low, and someone throws when it is high. Rumors have not been confirmed after all, and most people's hearts are still upward. Only half a day of trading was done yesterday. The opening was stronger, and it gradually rose. Type C came out again for six yuan. Hefeng, Yitai, Shunchang, Hengfu, and Lianyi bought in, supplied by Dingkang, Zhenchang, and Tongkang. Jiufu, Xiexing Yuan, and Lianhe also came out in the middle, once seeing a low price of 5.50 yuan. Later, Hongda, Jiufeng, Shengda, Yichang, etc. still had purchases, and it slightly rebounded, and the market price was offset. No one has asked about Type D from beginning to end, so it could not be opened. As a result, the fluctuations were extremely small, but Type A felt slightly disadvantaged. The total number of transactions was about 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan in half a day. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Huashang Electric Company were traded at a price of 7.70 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Friday) telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks are still flat. Bank stocks continued to fall weakly. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation continued to fall by two shillings and six pence, with a price of eight pounds and fifteen shillings. HSBC shares each fell by one pound, British registered shares were seventy-five pounds, and Hong Kong registered shares were seventy-seven pounds. There is a market with no market, and the rest remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>British and French Industries Pay Dividends</h3>
<p>The British and French Industries Limited Company, managed by the British Xiangmao Foreign Company, had a surplus of 300,000 national currency units last year. In addition to the interim dividend of two national currency units per share that has already been paid last year, it is planned to pay a final dividend of eight national currency units per share, for a total of ten national currency units for the whole year.</p>
<h3>The Business Consumption of Coal for Power Generation</h3>
<p>The big problem of Shanghai's life, in addition to rice, is also coal. The Shanghai Electric Power Company once consumed about 50,000 tons of coal per month, and according to the coal supply obtained earlier, only 35,000 tons, so the Public Works Department advised merchants and the public to conserve electricity as a stopgap measure, and re-employed experts to form a committee to study fair distribution of electricity. To understand whether this move is necessary, a 1940 December 7 statistic is used to analyze the amount of coal required for monthly power generation and the amount of coal consumed by various industries.</p>
<p>Street market public street lights 283</p>
<p>And private street lights 94</p>
<p>Other municipal consumption 633</p>
<p>Shanghai Waterworks Company 890</p>
<p>Shanghai Telephone Company 44</p>
<p>Shanghai Electric Military Company 1,477</p>
<p>Shanghai Fire Company 60</p>
<p>China Motor Bus 67</p>
<p>Household electric lights 1,664</p>
<p>Commercial electric lights 3,888</p>
<p>Household electric lights, etc. 974</p>
<p>Commercial electric furnaces, etc. 832</p>
<p>Other commercial electricity 1,610</p>
<p>Elevator 14</p>
<p>Industrial electricity 32,910</p>
<p>Small horsepower 5,194</p>
<p>French Tram Company 718</p>
<p>A total of 51,349 tons, the coal consumed by industrial members (including the French tram company) accounted for 75% of the total consumption, totaling 38,800 tons, which is more than 13,800 tons more than the current coal supply obtained by the Electric Power Company. As for private electricity consumption, although the time for mandatory restrictions has not yet arrived, if private individuals do not know how to conserve, forced use will be inevitable. Conserving one point of private electricity consumption can increase one point of industrial and commercial electricity consumption. If we use industrial and commercial electricity, it will inevitably be further reduced, and the impact will be that there will be more unemployment, and the future will be unimaginable. (Crane)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Fine Yarn Soars, Double Horse Leads to a Lot</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending upward, and the rising trend is gradually strengthening. This is because the foreign exchange has contracted and the standard gold has soared, allowing buyers to be active, resulting in good morale. However, most of the sellers still have no intention of covering, so the rising trend is not very violent. However, the amount absorbed by large firms in the industry is not only not out, but also increasing. As for the actual sales level, the wholesale transactions of Hong Kong gangs are still not seeing much improvement, but the rising trend of 42 counts is sharp, which is quite amazing. The high price of 20 count Double Horse is 1,430 yuan, and the low price is 1,405 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday market closure, speculators dispersed. Someone wanted to buy at 1,430 yuan, it is said. Tomorrow, 170 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Siam, and another 440 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The opening market situation of Double Horse in the morning was still peaceful, and the first board price was 1,407 yuan. After a while, it fell slightly to 05 yuan. Immediately after the foreign exchange opened and the standard gold rose, morale suddenly became sharp, and the buying shouts were loud, gradually rising to 1,424 yuan. However, the pressure from the short side was still heavy, and it fell back to 1,419 yuan. However, the gold price was still advancing towards the peak, and the market situation rebounded to 1,430 yuan. However, those who profited spat out and returned down, falling to 1,424 yuan at the close. It was found that the transaction statistics for half a day were 7,950 packages. The amount purchased by each gang is listed separately on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 290 Mainland 10</p>
<p>Fellow Merchants 7,650 Statistics 7,950</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Become More Strong</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation: The raw materials for 42 counts have soared, because the thread price has jumped by more than 100 yuan, so people's hearts are shaking. Those who hold the goods are unwilling to sell them. The raw material yarn market for 20 counts is also upward, and the market is in a strong state due to the shrinking foreign exchange, it is said.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is becoming more firm due to the huge consumption by all parties and the repeated good trade in cotton cloth. As a result, the closing price rose by about 20 pounds.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was also affected by New York. First, it rose due to purchases by yarn mills and the general public, and then it rose again due to short covering. Therefore, yesterday's closing price actually rose by more than seven rupees, and at the same time, yesterday's forecast also looked higher by one rupee.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction is becoming more active due to the continuous advance of American and cotton. The market situation is becoming more active, and the prices are frequently rising. In addition, the current yarn is stable, and the overall situation is favorable to the long side. Therefore, the general industry is doing business with each other, which is even more lively, but because of Saturday, there are not many transactions. It is expected that a competitive situation will unfold next week.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Factory Cloth Fluctuates, Eastern Piece Goods See a Unique Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for factory cloth fluctuated. White goods fluctuated by 2.5 cents. The selling market for coarse cloth is not easy to rise, and the prices of hand goods are all below the factory prices. Recently, it has seen a slight rebound, with each grade continuing to rise by 2.5 cents per piece. The opening price of fine cloth twill is flat, and the price of colored cloth line is up by 1.5 to 5 cents. Bleached cloth is uniquely tired, which is due to the strong or weak needs of the customer gangs. Due to the half-day business hours on Saturday, the transaction was very light, totaling one hundred and several dozen pieces. Zhejiang and Guangdong gangs handled more than one hundred pieces of colored cloth coarse and fine cloth, and the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than two hundred pieces of coarse and fine twill colored cloth line. Tomorrow, there will be one thousand and twenty-five pieces of piece goods shipped to Hong Kong, and another eighty-five pieces shipped to Luo.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth continues to rise, and the situation is becoming more strong. The closing price of white goods Longtou fine cloth in the morning was $48.89, and the gray market was tighter in the afternoon, with an opening of $49.30, an increase of 6-7 cents per piece. Four Gentlemen Serge rose to $1.3625 due to the collection by fellow merchants and hoarders.</p>
<h3>Feather Yarn Ni Sold Smoothly</h3>
<p>Feather yarn Ni has a demand from native customer gangs. Wholesale households in the street are particularly fond of it, and Western clothing gangs also have allocations. As the actual sales are approaching, its outlets are expanding step by step. Imported goods are lacking and expensive, so the transaction is naturally more prosperous with local factory goods. (The writer said that according to today's market price of local factory feather yarn Ni, there is more than enough to make imported goods from the old past year), yesterday's Western goods feather yarn Ni generally cost about $29 per yard, Eastern goods $22-23, local factory goods $18-19. Half a yuan should be added to the splitting and zero cutting.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Cart White All Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market had more incoming households, and the Vietnam trend was still tight, continuing to see an upward trend. The association's plan to sell spot goods at $81.20 to 50 cents for coarse white, up 30 cents. Orders dated March 20 were $81.40, 50 cents, 70 cents, 80 cents, up 50 cents. Orders dated the end of March were $81.85, $82, $2.10, $2.40, up 70 cents. Orders dated April 10 were $82.70, $80, Dutch red was $63.50 to $64, up 40 cents, Taikoo B Mark was $82.20 to 50 cents, up 70 cents, the end of March was $82, DY Mark was $79.30, and HX Mark was $77.80 to $78.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Raw Powder Continues to Tighten</h3>
<p>Due to the thin inventory of raw powder and the temporary arrival of goods, the grades are incomplete and continue to rise. Yesterday, the Flying Kylin Mark was priced at $125, Lao Qilin $100, Snake Mark $105, I Mark $110, Double TA Mark $98, Double T Mark $88, Small Pack Eastern Goods $105. It was found that the goods also have a grain relationship, so the tight situation has not ended.</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Clarifying the Rice Market: Rice and Grain Hoarders Must Be Investigated. Resolving to Sanction the Rice Price Is Not Difficult to Suppress. The Gray Market Premium Began to Fall Yesterday. About 70,000 Bags of Tribute Rice Arrived by Foreign Ships Yesterday and Today.</h3>
<p>The rice price problem is becoming more serious by the day. Observing the arrival of rice and the number of warehouse stocks, it is obvious that there is no shortage of rice. The matter is obvious and cannot be concealed. Since the two concession authorities have recently seen numerous rumors and rising trends in the rice market, and in view of the fact that the people cannot live and security is worrying, the resident investigators of the rice market were ordered to arrest the bad rice weevils the day before yesterday. The gray market premium only saw a slight decline yesterday. However, the future of rice prices is still serious. Although this initial method seems to be effective, it is feared that it will become negligent over time and it will be difficult to sustain. It must be implemented vigorously and quickly to formulate effective guidelines for unified management, so as to avoid the people's hearts from being disturbed. This is what the citizens of the whole city hope for.</p>
<p>Resolving to Sanction Can Stabilize</p>
<p>After the concession authorities began to take severe measures against illegal rice weevils the day before yesterday, the gray market for rice in the market yesterday slightly fell by two yuan per stone. However, whenever the authorities take severe measures, speculators will temporarily hide. Afterwards, they will relapse. The authorities have decided to continue to investigate and deal with those who engage in illegal transactions in the market, and in order to seek a radical solution, they will also investigate and deal with those who purchase spot goods and hoard them, and those who hoard large quantities of rice and raise prices. Under the authorities' determination to sanction the rice market in this port, it may gradually tend to stabilize. Yesterday, 32,000 bags of rice and grain arrived in this port from overseas producing areas. Statistics show that 210,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in the port last week, and there are still 400,000 bags of foreign rice that have been ordered and can be shipped to this port within this month.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Asks the Authorities for Instructions</p>
<p>In view of the soaring rice prices, which are not only related to the livelihood of the common people but also detrimental to social security, the three rice industry groups, the Shanghai Soybean, Rice, Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry, and the Rice Shop Industry, held a joint temporary meeting the day before yesterday. According to the news revealed by the association yesterday, the three associations will send a joint letter to the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee immediately, requesting that the two concession authorities be asked to give specific instructions to stabilize the people's food, so as to follow. It is reported that the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee has already sent letters to the two concession authorities, in addition to requesting practical assistance, and also asked for instructions on stabilizing the people's food and banning illegal transactions in the rice market. The two authorities have not yet given a formal reply.</p>
<p>Inventory of Rice Storage in Warehouses</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee's inventory of rice storage for this period (from last Thursday to this Thursday) was completed yesterday. The bottom of the city's (including Pudong, Hongkou, and the Central District) Chinese and foreign rice and grain warehouses reached more than 600,000 bags, of which the most were Taikoo Warehouses, followed by Public and Xiangtai Warehouses. Roosevelt was third, and Zhejiang Xingye, Bank of China, Maotai, etc. were fourth. The above rice storage is limited to each rice warehouse. As for rice shop stores, purchases on behalf of people's food groups, and purchases by citizens, they are not included in the survey. According to an estimate by a rice merchant yesterday, the number of rice hoarded by households and the people exceeds the warehouse storage, so the actual rice storage in Shanghai is close to 2 million bags.</p>
<p>About 70,000 Bags of Rice Arrived Yesterday and Today</p>
<p>The abundant source of foreign rice has been repeatedly recorded in previous reports. It is now known that China Lun Foreign Company's Dedalun directly loaded 47,223 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, of which more than 16,000 bags are broken rice, and there are also 9,803 bags of corn. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and docked at Pudong Hongsheng Wharf for unloading. The French wheel Gouver Neur Genral A. Varenne, managed by the company, also loaded 30,048 tons of foreign rice from Saigon, with about 31,000 bags. The French wheel will arrive in Shanghai today and is scheduled to dock at Pudong Longmao Wharf for unloading. There are still a large number of foreign rice arriving later.</p>
<h3>Five British Directors Express: Re-election Campaign; Decision Expected Early Next Week; Japanese Plan Not Revealed</h3>
<p>A member of the British Association of this city disclosed yesterday morning (15th) that all five current British directors of the Public Works Department are willing to participate in the board election again this year. It is found that the current five British directors are Kai Ziwei (General Director of the Public Works Department), Hai Lai, McDonald, Mitchell, and Bao Hui'er. It is heard that the British Association has notified its members of this matter and it is expected to be decided early next week. In addition, the Japanese side disclosed yesterday morning that the Japanese have formulated a plan to participate in this year's election of directors of the Public Works Department, but the details have not been revealed. As for the American side, it has nominated Ming Side and Aleman as American candidates in late February.</p>
<h3>Daylight Saving Time Implemented at Midnight</h3>
<p>This year's daylight saving time movement was implemented at midnight yesterday. Although the Jianghai Customs will not advance the clock, the office hours of all departments will be advanced by one hour from tomorrow. The announcement is as follows: "From March 17 this year, the office hours of this Customs will be set from 8:30 AM to 11:00 AM, and from 12:30 PM to 3:30 PM." As for the curfew time in the two concessions, it will also be implemented one hour earlier according to the daylight saving time movement from today. It is also learned that the city's large and small factories will postpone implementation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Western Boundary Beyond Patrol Duties To Be Abolished Starting Tomorrow Morning; The Bureau of Works Formally Announced Yesterday; The "Special Police Force" Will Take Over Simultaneously</h3>
<p>According to a public notice from the Bureau of Works Information Office, "The Public Concession Police Department's patrol duties in the area outside the western boundary of Shanghai will be abolished starting at 11:00 AM on the 17th of this month (Monday), and will be taken over by the Shanghai Western Special Police Force."</p>
<p>The Final Details Are Still Undecided</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western "Special Police Force" was originally scheduled to be established yesterday (the 15th) morning to take over the area outside the boundary roads, and the Bureau of Works Police Department personnel who were transferred to the "Special Police Force" went to the Special Police Headquarters at 57 Great Western Road yesterday morning. However, the establishment of the "Special Police Force" was postponed to Monday of next week because the "final details" have not yet been resolved. Of those who went to the "Special Police Headquarters" yesterday morning, only "Director-General" Pan Da and "Deputy Director-General" Bai Lanjin Suopu wore special police uniforms. It is said that the postponement of the establishment of the "Special Police Force" yesterday was due to the fact that some details still need to be resolved, and many police uniforms have not yet been made.</p>
<p>It Is Expected to Be Established Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>According to "Deputy Director-General of the Special Police Headquarters" Kelisha, police officers assigned by the Police Department are expected to be transferred to the "Special Police Force" at 11:00 AM on Monday. At that time, a simple ceremony will be held. Once the "Special Police" start working, it is hoped that they will soon turn bad land into good land and maintain order. Furthermore, Pan Da's scheduled swearing-in ceremony yesterday morning has also been postponed to Monday. It is said that the Public Concession patrols and "Municipal Police" currently working in western Shanghai will all withdraw next week and transfer their responsibilities to the "Special Police Force."</p>
<p>The Tax Revenue Issue Is the Most Contentious</p>
<p>The reasons for the repeated delays in the establishment of the "Special Police" are: first, the personnel issue, which has now been fully decided; and second, the funding issue. It is said that before the tax revenue issue is resolved, the necessary expenses for the "Headquarters" will be temporarily borne by the Ning side. The most difficult negotiation at present is the tax revenue issue. Chen Gongbo's demands are very extravagant. What the Bureau of Works contended for and was unwilling to give up during the tenure of former Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng will now be impossible to maintain in its entirety.</p>

<h3>British Ambassador Sir Cole To Leave Shanghai at the End of This Month; Attended the Royal Air Force Association the Day Before Yesterday; Ridiculed Those Who Go Back on Their Word and Break Promises</h3>
<p>British Ambassador to China, Sir Cole, was invited to attend the weekly banquet of the British Royal Air Force Association the day before yesterday (the 14th). During the banquet, the acting president of the association, Holland, gave a speech to welcome him. He said that the president of the association, Sir Sassoon, was unable to attend today. I would like to ask you to raise your glasses to the guest of honor today, Ambassador Cole, to thank the ambassador for his support of the association.</p>
<p>The Ambassador Extravagantly Said Shanghai Is Comfortable</p>
<p>After He spoke, Ambassador Cole stood up and gave a speech, saying that we are now living in an era of "going back on one's word and breaking promises," so how can I be exempt? I was invited to attend this farewell banquet, and I originally intended not to make any remarks, but this verbal agreement can easily be broken. I am very happy to come to Shanghai this time, especially because of the food problem. Although people have different opinions on the food problem, food is one of the two most important things in life. I have enjoyed both since returning to Shanghai, and will continue to do so until the end of this month, because I will be leaving at that time. The Ambassador also compared Chongqing to a rustic village and Shanghai to a luxurious Paris, and said that he had many feelings about going from the countryside to Paris and from frugality to extravagance.</p>
<p>Alexander Gave a Speech</p>
<p>After the Ambassador spoke, Holland invited Alexander, the counselor of the British Embassy, to report on wartime work. Alexander appealed to the British people to make great sacrifices in order to win victory, believing that the closer victory is, the greater the sacrifices will be, until success is achieved. In addition to Ambassador Cole and Alexander, those who attended the weekly banquet of the association yesterday included the Far East intelligence commissioner of the British Embassy, ​​Scott, and the secretary, Menzies, and more than one hundred others.</p>
<h3>Ireland's National Day Tomorrow, Solemn Ceremony, British Ambassador and Others Attending, American Officials Participating</h3>

<h3>Anti-Tuberculosis Movement Holds Medical Conference</h3>
<p>The population of Shanghai has increased sharply after the war, and the rising prices and difficult living conditions have made the health problems of residents particularly serious. Tuberculosis is spreading even more widely, and the mortality rate has increased sharply compared with before. Leaders from all walks of life in the city and the new medicine and new drug industry have jointly launched an anti-tuberculosis movement. This afternoon at 3:00 PM, a joint medical conference will be held at the YMCA in Baxianqiao in order to expand the movement and achieve great results.

<h3>Economic and Ideological Oppression, Japanese Public Opinion Boils, Daily Food Items Are Lacking, People's Livelihood Is Painful, Epidemics Are Prevalent Everywhere</h3>
<p>A recent article in the American Atlantic Magazine stated that the Japanese people, suffering from a long war and enduring pain, have now entered 1941. In military terms, Japan's invasion of China has superficial victories, but the truth of the war lies in the rear of Japan. Tens of millions of Japanese people are suffering from various adverse effects, such as death, disease, lack of food and daily necessities, inflation, etc. Japan is an orderly and controlled people, and they do not complain about the hard work of working 72 hours a week, but they are extremely opposed to restrictions such as only being allowed to use 12 ounces of sugar per month and only being allowed to use four matchsticks per day. Now butter and wheat have disappeared in the country, and milk and rice are very scarce, and the unaffordable cost of living is far beyond the ability of millions of families.</p>
<p>Thought Police Deter Speech</p>
<p>There are many kinds of police rampant in Japan, one is the economic police, and the other is the thought police. Among them, the first category has arrested 688,000 merchants in two years, all of whom were convicted of allegedly selling various goods privately, including food, medicine, gasoline, leather, cotton, etc. The people arrested and imprisoned by the second type of thought police are also counted in the hundreds and thousands, because the people complain about the various sacrifices ordered by the National Spiritual Mobilization Law, and as a result, those who dare to express dissatisfaction at banquets or in street talks are mostly thrown into prison. To this day, there are 1,200 university teachers in prison.</p>
<p>Coarse Food Is Painful</p>
<p>In the huge arms manufacturing industry, the wages of workers are extremely high and they are less affected by rising prices. The most suffering are the white-collar class, such as teachers, students, clerks, and employees. Although prices have increased five times, wages have not increased. The quality of food is extremely low, and the materials for clothing are nothing but fake products made of fiber. The water source needed by 6.5 million people in the Tokyo area is extremely scarce, resulting in the prevalence of diphtheria, scarlet fever, dysentery, etc. Although the government attributes it to early days, it is actually due to the large amount of water used by the munitions factories near Tokyo. Residents who dare to call for insufficient water will be arrested by the thought police, and those who privately use water and electricity exceeding the limit will eventually be arrested by the economic police.</p>
<p>Reduced Agricultural Production, Rice Shortage Is Worrying</p>
<p>The Japanese love fine white rice, which is fresh, tender, and delicious, but the government has ordered that 70% of coarse rice and 30% of fine rice must be mixed in every meal. This measure is entirely to relieve the rice shortage. Due to the lack of labor in Japan, many farmers are lured to work in arms factories by high wages, resulting in less agricultural production. They can only import rice from Annam, Burma, and Siam. However, on the one hand, this kind of rice is rough and does not suit the Japanese taste, and on the other hand, Japan's foreign exchange fund is very empty, which is another drain. If this year's harvest cannot be improved compared with last year, then there is a possibility of famine in Japan and Korea this winter. Due to the shortage of rice, the number of livestock such as chickens and pigs has decreased, and the production of eggs has also become rare.</p>
<p>Economic Collapse Is Not Far Away</p>
<p>Japan banned the sale of cotton fabrics two years ago. Even the 7,000 police officers in Tokyo today no longer wear wool uniforms, but wear all-cotton uniforms. At present, even the cotton used for medical purposes is difficult to purchase except for military use. Other medicines such as iodine, quinine, aspirin, etc. are extremely scarce. In short, there is no prospect of solving all these shortages at present, and it seems that Japan will only have one way out after the end of the war: economic collapse.</p>
<h3>French Merchant Water and Electricity Company Announces Electricity Reduction Measures; Electric Lights Are Not Allowed for Advertisements and Signboards; There Are Other Regulations for Reducing Commonly Used Electricity</h3>
<p>The two concession power companies believe that the amount of coal stored in Shanghai is limited and can only supply a few months. If a large amount is not transported to Shanghai, the electricity supply will be affected. Therefore, they have asked residents in the concession to save electricity in order to overcome the current difficulties. The French Concession Water and Electricity Company yesterday specially stipulated restrictions and notified residents in the concession, saying, "For notification purposes, due to the difficulty in fuel supply, the Concession Administration has decided to implement the following measures immediately until further notice. (1)</p>
<p>The supply of electric current for heating is prohibited except for (a) industrial heating, (b) necessary medical equipment, and (c) electric stoves. If users do not comply with this regulation, the supply of electric current will be cancelled immediately. (2)</p>
<p>The supply of electric current for electric lights is not allowed for (a) lanterns, (b) important electric light sign advertisements or decorations, (c) strong illumination of facades such as shops and public places, (d) searchlights or other methods to illuminate the exterior of buildings or various equipment. If users do not comply with this regulation, the supply of electric current will be cancelled immediately. (3)</p>
<p>For users whose monthly consumption of commonly used electricity (referring to the consumption in the same month last year or the consumption in the previous month) exceeds 500 degrees, the portion exceeding 500 degrees of their monthly electricity consumption should be reduced by at least 30% starting from today. If these users violate this regulation in any month, their electricity consumption in that month should be reduced by at least 60%. If they commit the offense again, the supply of electric current will be suspended for a period of at least enough to compensate for the electricity used and should take into account the above reduction measures. (4) For users of electric power and non-prohibited electric lights or electric heating whose monthly consumption of commonly used electricity (explanation as above) exceeds 500 degrees, they should make every effort to control the amount of current they use for the public good. The implementation of this measure should be handled by the Superintendent of the Police Department and the Manager of the French Tramway Electric Light Company within their respective scopes of duties. This is announced."</p>
<p>According to the Pingming News Agency reporter's interview with the Public Concession Power Company yesterday regarding the coal for power generation, the company currently has more than 150,000 tons in storage, and the total amount of coal required daily is more than 1,700 tons. In this way, the stored coal can supply three months of demand. It is expected that after the implementation of the electricity reduction plan, the daily coal demand can be reduced to 1,400 tons. However, this is only a temporary solution. As for the current source of coal, half of it is supplied by the Kaiao Mining Bureau. As for requesting the London government to allocate ships to transport coal, we are waiting for a reply.</p>

<h3>White Russian Bodyguard Injures Rickshaw Puller; Chinese and Foreign Passersby Are Uneasy; Detectives Arrive and Take Him to the Police Station</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 14th) at noon in front of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund, a White Russian bodyguard named Telaitov had a fight with a rickshaw puller and even pulled out a pistol to injure someone, resulting in his arrest by the police. The incident was caused by two Japanese women taking a rickshaw to the vicinity of the Huizhong Hotel. The puller shouted after them because the fare they gave was too low. The two women ignored him, and the puller was extremely angry and pushed the women. At that time, Telaitov was standing next to his Chinese employer's car (registration number 10198). Seeing this, he tried to stop him and had a fight with the puller. The White Russian was held by the puller and could not break free. Enraged, he suddenly</p>
<p>Pulled out a pistol and hit the puller's head with the butt of the gun, causing him to bleed profusely. Among the crowd of onlookers on the side of the road, a Westerner, seeing this, stepped forward bravely and punched the White Russian in the face. A Chinese also stepped forward and joined in seizing the White Russian's pistol. At that time, an old woman in the crowd mistakenly identified a German Jewish refugee as the perpetrator.</p>
<p>She pulled him tightly and shouted that he had nothing to do with it. After a while, a patrol officer and a Western detective arrived and dispersed the crowd. After asking about the situation, they took the White Russian to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3>Traveler Dies in Room, Head Has Gunshot Wound, Suspected of Committing Suicide by Shooting</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, a traveler in a dark gray suit came to the Datong Hotel on Nanjing Road to rent a room. The waiter led him to room 203 on the second floor and paid 20 yuan for the room. He wrote down his name as Wang Shoumin, a local, 30 years old, in the registration book. He then went out, and in less than half an hour, he returned, going back and forth three or four times. After returning to the hotel at around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, there was no movement.</p>
<p>The waiter on duty, who had closed the door tightly, did not suspect anything at first. It was not until after 9:00 PM that the early shift waiter had left work and the night shift waiter, No. 23, noticed that the room had not rung for a long time, and became suspicious. So he went to knock on the door, but there was no response for a long time. He peered through the keyhole, but could not see anything. So he climbed up a wooden ladder and opened the glass window above, and saw that the electric light in the room was bright, and a corpse was curled up in front of the bed. He knew that the guest had committed suicide without a doubt, and immediately reported the information to the accounting room, which was forwarded to the Old Gate Police Station. Detectives rushed to the scene, found a pistol next to the corpse, and found more than 100 yuan in national currency and a bunch of keys in his pocket. They took photos of the corpse in the room and waited for the family to claim it. Then they called an ambulance and sent the corpse to the coroner's office for examination. As for the name Wang Shoumin, whether it was a pseudonym, and the cause of death, the police station is currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Mike Gao Paul Road, Chinese Police Officer Shot, Stray Bullet Wounds Rickshaw Puller, Two Robbers Escape Without a Trace</h3>
<p>At around 8:75 PM last night, at the Yida Rice Store at No. 30 Mike Gao Paul Road in the French Concession, the store had closed its doors. Suddenly, two robbers, pretending to buy rice, tricked the store to open the door and entered. They both took out pistols and threatened the store owner and clerks. As a result, they grabbed 50 yuan in national currency from the counter and fled. At that time, they happened to meet Chinese and Western detectives from the French Police Station on patrol. They shouted for them to stop and be searched. Unexpectedly, the robbers took the lead and opened fire to resist arrest. The police also pulled out their guns and returned fire. Both sides exchanged more than a dozen shots. As a result, Chinese police officer No. 226 was shot in the back, and a stray bullet hit the left back of rickshaw puller Hang Chaodang (28 years old, from Jiangbei), causing him to bleed profusely. Because the area was crowded, the two robbers eventually escaped into the crowd without a trace. The wounded police officer and rickshaw puller were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Farmer Carrying a Bag of Rice Actually Shot</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, a farmer was walking on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai carrying a bag of rice, presumably intending to smuggle rice into the Public Concession. He was stopped by a "Municipal Police" officer, and an argument broke out. The farmer was shot in the chest by the "Police" officer and was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Dentist and Mother-in-Law Cohabit, Suddenly Develop Rift and Litigate, Accuse Xiao of Intended Injury and Abandonment, Xiao Denies Everything, Judge Advises Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Ren Junming, a Cantonese dentist, lives at No. 15, Lane 229, Baker Road. He has a clinic on Lloyd Road. Twenty-five years ago, he married a woman surnamed Lin from the same province. Ren's father-in-law, Mr. Lin, remarried a woman surnamed Xiao from Gansu Road (16 years old at the time) as his second wife because of the pain of losing his wife. When Xiao was 28 years old, Mr. Lin passed away. Ren Junming, as a son-in-law, often went to offer condolences. At that time, Xiao was still young and had good looks, and had more private savings, which led to a long period of friction. Ren actually had an affair with Xiao.</p>
<p>He then cohabited, and Ren even divorced Ms. Lin twelve years ago because of his relationship with Xiao. Xiao then officially cohabited with Ren and his mother, Ren Tang, and sister, Ren Zijun, causing Xiao to run out of money. And now that she is 41 years old, her looks have faded, and she has become resentful. On the 27th of last month, Ren Tang and her daughter-in-law, Ren Xiao, had a conflict over a trivial matter of using boiling water. At that time, Ren's sister, Zijun, also joined in. Later, Ren Zijun reported to the New Gate Police Station that Ren Xiao had injured her with a kettle. After the Chinese detective Ye Yushan ordered her to go to the</p>
<p>Hospital for examination, the results proved that Ren Zijun had minor injuries to her face and chest. He then filed a complaint against Ren Xiao with the Special First Court. This morning, Judge Meng Tingke opened the Criminal Court Eight to summon her. The police station lawyer Peng Qiqi prosecuted her for the crime of injury. When asked by Ren Xiao, she denied the injury and hired lawyer Ge Zhaoji to defend her. Lawyer Ge presented a letter from Ren Junming, which stated that Xiao and Ren Junming were originally in a relationship of son-in-law and mother-in-law. Since her husband's death, Ren took advantage of her wealth and used all means to seduce her and become promiscuous. Later, she remarried to a man surnamed Guan in Hong Kong. Ren</p>
<p>He used all means to harass her and force her to flee to Guangzhou with him. He came to Shanghai in 1935 to practice medicine. All the medical equipment and household expenses were paid by her with her private savings. Now Ren saw that she was running out of money and suddenly had bad intentions. He abused her first and then falsely accused her of injury in order to achieve the purpose of abandoning her. After reviewing the case, the court ordered that the case be postponed for further hearing, advised both parties to go out and reconcile, and ordered Ren Junming to appear in court at the next hearing.</p>

<h3>Youth Fan Chengji Sent a Letter of Threat, Sentenced to Four Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Fan Chengji, a Ningbo youth who lives at No. 7, Lane 142, Malan Road, recently joined the Youth Association as a member. After paying a membership fee of 25 yuan, the association did not issue a membership card in time, so it first gave him a receipt. Before the 17th of last month, Fan took the receipt to the Youth Association on Sichuan Road to take a bath, but was refused by the staff. Fan questioned the reason, which led to a conflict with the association's staff. Afterwards, Fan was refunded his membership fee by Guan Ganzhong, the director of the general association, and was refused membership without explaining the reason. Fan, who was young and energetic, actually wrote two letters, each with an eye drawn on it, and the words "Be careful of your life," and attached a bullet to each letter, which were sent to the two staff members of the association. However, afterwards, Fan asked himself whether this action violated the law and was against his conscience, so he surrendered himself to the Central Police Station the day before yesterday. After an investigation by Chinese detective Ren Fengwu, he was sent to the Criminal Court Four of the Special First Court this morning. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him under Article 305 of the Criminal Law. After being questioned by Judge Fei, Fan Chengji was sentenced to four months in prison and allowed to pay a fine of two yuan per day in lieu of imprisonment. The threatening letters were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Pang Likang, who claims that the news item "Counterfeit Transport Permits" published in the Shanghai local news section of the Shen Bao on the 15th of this month does not conform to the facts. After investigation, my client is a legitimate businessman. Previously, Mr. Zhu, the manager of the San Tai Cotton Cloth Shop, wanted to transport goods to another port and needed a transport permit. My client then indirectly introduced him to Wu A'gen, who was recommended by Wang Zao, to handle the matter. My client was not involved in the matter of the counterfeit transport permits and was not aware of the situation. The court acquitted my client and issued an official notice of innocence. The newspaper report stated that my client was sentenced to three months of imprisonment, which is inconsistent with the facts. It appears that there was a mistake in the reporting. This report is related to my client’s reputation and I request that your newspaper issue a statement clarifying the matter to protect his reputation and to adhere to the facts. Therefore, I am writing to you, hoping that you will investigate and issue a correction. Sincerely, Zhou Shiying, Lawyer, March 15th.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Methods of Studying</h3>
<p>— Yuan Shan</p>
<p>Speaking of methods of studying, I remember when I was in elementary school, a teacher once explained a very clear and reasonable method to us: now let me record it below and present it to you children for your use.</p>
<p>He said: "The method of studying should be like a shopkeeper's bookkeeping; the shopkeeper must keep accounts every day, and we must also clarify and review our lessons every day. A shopkeeper cannot stop keeping accounts for a few days, and then record the unrecorded accounts of the previous few days on one day. Because such bookkeeping is bound to lack detailed and accurate content. Our studying is also like this. We cannot stop reviewing our lessons for a few days, and then review several days’ worth of lessons on another day; otherwise, it will make us confused and unclear. Furthermore, the shopkeeper must check the accounts every week and every month to see if the shop has made money or lost money in this week and this month. Our studying should also be checked every week and every month to see what lessons are not remembered very clearly or have been forgotten. If so, we should think of ways to clarify and familiarize ourselves with them. If we study in this way, it will definitely be effective."</p>
<h3>About Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, airplanes have truly been in the limelight, bombing to the east, reconnaissance to the west, killing everywhere, destroying everywhere, which shows that they are exceptionally active in the sky. A Hui is already used to airplanes, and has suffered greatly from them: forcing his family to flee and finally manage to take refuge in Shanghai, for a full four years. Although he often looked up at those airplanes, the rumbling sound of the engines as they flew over his head pierced his ears, and he only felt a little different. At this time, he suddenly wanted to know more about airplanes, so he asked his father.</p>
<p>"When an airplane on the ground wants to take off, it must taxi for a certain distance until the air density under the wings reaches a certain level before it can slowly rise. Therefore, the airfield must have a large area. If, when flying an airplane, the propeller at the front sends air to the back of the airplane, and the wind on the ground blows back from the front, like a ship sailing with the wind, then the airplane cannot fly. Therefore, airplanes must take off and land against the wind. So the airfield must have a cylindrical wind sock hanging on a high pole. When the airplane is taking off and landing, it must aim at the tail of the wind sock, which is clear proof of flying against the wind. During the early days of the First World War in Europe, when airplanes were first used in war, bombs were placed in the pilot's seat. When bombing, the pilot would hold the bomb in his hands and throw it down, which was very inconvenient and difficult to hit the target. Fortunately, the bombs at that time were mostly small. If there were half-ton bombs, how could a pilot handle them? Later, the bombs were all installed under the wings or fuselage. As long as the mechanism was activated and the bomb clips were opened, the bombs would automatically fall, which was much more convenient and greatly increased the effectiveness of bombing. An airplane has two fixed machine guns. If it is a fighter plane, it has more than two. The bullets are fired from between the propeller wings, which is most powerful. Firing backwards is less convenient, so protecting the airplane's tail rudder is most difficult, because when firing backwards, one must be careful not to hit the tail rudder of one's own airplane. One is often taken advantage of by the opponent, leading to utter defeat. Therefore, airplanes now often fly in formation, with every three airplanes arranged in a chevron or triangle, with the two airplanes behind protecting the tail of the one in front, which is also the reason..." Father suddenly stopped here because Mother was calling him.</p>
<h3>Why Be Punctual?</h3>
<p>— Shao Ruiying</p>
<p>"Not being punctual" is an old habit of us Chinese, so, as children of Chinese people, we are naturally no exception. Dear children, would you like to be an "unpunctual" child? If not, quickly start being punctual from today! The reason why Chinese people are "unpunctual" is that they did not develop the habit of "being punctual" in childhood. Therefore, children must pay absolute attention to this issue of "being punctual"!</p>
<p>Why should we "be punctual"? Because time, once gone, never returns. Mr. Zhu Ziqing said it very well: "When the leaves wither, they turn green again. When the swallows leave, they return again. When time passes, can it return again? Smart children, tell me. When time passes, can it return again?" Although I am not smart, I dare to assert that time will not return. So how many benefits are there to being punctual?</p>
<p>First, it saves time. Like our train, which leaves at 2 o'clock, if you arrive at the station at 2:15, the train has already left, and you have to wait for the next train. Isn't the time in between wasted? Being punctual avoids this, so isn't that a benefit of "being punctual"?</p>
<p>Second, it avoids delaying things. If you are not punctual and miss the train, you will not be able to reach your destination. At this time, the work you need to do will be delayed. If it is an important matter, related to the overall situation, wouldn't it delay the affairs of many people? Being punctual avoids this, so isn't that a benefit of "being punctual"?</p>
<p>Third, it maintains order. Like a meeting, which is scheduled to be held at a certain place on a certain morning at a certain time, some members arrive at 8:30, while others arrive at 9:30. With people arriving at different times, how can the meeting place not be chaotic? Where can we talk about order? Being punctual avoids this, so isn't that an advantage of "being punctual"?</p>
<p>Fourth, it increases efficiency. Because you are not punctual, the work you do will definitely not be more than others. If punctual people do two things, you can only do one thing. If you are also punctual, the efficiency of your work will not be like this, so isn't that a benefit of "being punctual"?</p>
<h3>The Conversation Between Sand and Mud</h3>
<p>— Luo Ying</p>
<p>One day, Sand and Mud met. Each boasted about itself, so they began to quarrel. Sand said: "How clumsy you are, lying on the ground and by the river all day long. Look how free I am, flying around, how happy!"</p>
<p>Mud said unconvincedly: "What's so happy about you? When Brother Wind tells you to go west, you don't dare to go east, when he tells you to go east, you don't dare to go west; being controlled by others and being a slave to others, what's so carefree about that? Also, your companions are all scattered, each going its own way. Look how united we are!" Sand had no words to answer.</p>

<h3>Kang Yuan Toy Essay Contest, Parents' Category, First Place: My Child and Kang Yuan Toys</h3>
<p>— Fang Wenyu</p>
<p>Four years ago, one spring day, the breeze was gentle, the sun was warm, the island was filled with flowers, which aroused our desire for an outing. So, our family invited Mr. D's family to go to Longhua to see the peach blossoms. Hearing about the outing, the children were very happy, but Yan'er had just recovered from measles and could not be exposed to the wind. Seeing so many of us going, while he was left alone at home, he was naturally very sad. But there was no way because of his illness, so he made a deal with me, asking me to bring him a toy when I returned home.</p>
<p>I fulfilled my promise. When I returned from the outing, I went to the National Goods Company alone and bought a jumping frog made by Kang Yuan Factory. When I got home, I silently wound it up and placed it on the floor. The frog jumped back and forth, just like a real one. Yan'er watched and clapped his hands and cheered. I said that it was caught in the fields of Longhua, and he blamed me for not catching a few more.</p>
<p>The frog stopped jumping after a while, so I picked it up and taught Yan'er how to wind it up, but Yan'er was still skeptical and dared not move. This made his older brother Hong'er regret following us. He said, if he had known it would be like this, he would have preferred to stay at home and play with something interesting.</p>
<p>Later, seeing that Hong'er really envied his younger brother so much, and Yan'er refused to take out the frog to play with, I went and bought a Kang Yuan Factory car for Hong'er. He was also very happy, crawling on the floor all day, driving the car, shouting, "Ooh ooh ooh, the car is coming, make way, make way!"</p>
<p>When the August 13th Incident broke out, the heroes defending the country were often showing their power in the air. Whenever the children heard the sound of planes, they would raise their heads to look, frequently clapping and cheering, especially after the bombing of the Izumo warship, which aroused the children's envy even more.</p>
<p>I bought an airplane for Hong'er and a fire-shooting machine gun for Yan'er, which were also products of Kang Yuan Factory. Who knew that they would fight all day long? Either Yan'er said that his older brother was flying the airplane and bombing to scare him, or Hong'er cried and told me that his younger brother was shooting at him with the machine gun. I often couldn't settle the dispute.</p>
<p>One day, they were arguing again. Yan'er ran to tell me that Hong'er had broken all the toys. He wanted Hong'er to pay for them, but Hong'er refused. So I asked Hong'er how he had broken the toys. According to Hong'er, he didn't know why the airplane could move, why the machine gun could fire, and why the frog could jump, so he disassembled them one by one to find out. But he knew that it was easy to destroy but difficult to build. Hearing that his beloved toys had been broken by his older brother, Yan'er wanted him to pay for them, so they had a dispute. Knowing the reason, and seeing the disassembled toy parts, I felt that Hong'er's curiosity was a manifestation of a child's instinct, which we should make good use of and guide. On the other hand, I felt that Yan'er's demand for compensation was also justified. So I helped Hong'er spend an afternoon assembling the disassembled toys: the frog could jump again, the fire-shooting machine gun could shoot out sparks again, and the wheels of the airplane could turn again. Yan'er smiled, and Hong'er was even happier.</p>
<p>While working, they both concentrated and helped me assemble the toys. At the same time, I told them the principle of why the frog could jump, why the airplane could move, and why the machine gun could fire; I also told them that we should not be afraid of destruction, but we should be most afraid of not being able to build after destruction. Seeing their four bright little eyes staring at me, I knew that they understood what I said to some extent. From then on, they understood Kang Yuan toys more intimately. I am very grateful to Kang Yuan toys for giving my children a practical education and training.</p>
<p>Finally, I have one more suggestion to contribute to Kang Yuan Factory. I remember a friend who returned from Japan brought me a Japanese children's toy: a clock. The parts of the clock toy were separated, with assembly diagrams and instructions. Children could assemble it by following the diagrams and instructions. After the assembly was completed, as long as you wound it up, it would tick-tock. What a meaningful toy! I think if Kang Yuan Factory could offer such toys, not necessarily clocks, but other things like cars and airplanes, with all the parts disassembled and sold with assembly diagrams and instructions, allowing children to assemble them themselves, it would not only teach children about mechanical knowledge but also train the use of their small muscles. What a meaningful thing that would be!</p>

<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>"Chronicle of Heroes' Bloody Battles"</h3>
<p>— Mo Ye</p>
<p>Revolution is a very arduous task. It will encounter stubborn resistance from the established system, and it will cruelly set up many traps to make you surrender and destroy yourself. Therefore, our revolutionary actions are by no means something that can be achieved by shouting a few slogans and writing a few posters. It requires sacrifice and irrigation to grow brilliant flowers on barren land!</p>
<p>It is a fact that the people of Russia, with tears in their eyes, endured everything and struggled under a life of suffering. Cruel, dark, and murderous, the Tsar and all the aristocratic classes relied on these vicious methods to carry out the most despicable actions and became the executioners of tens of millions of people. We have seen "Pugachev" and felt our hearts burning with anger! We have also shed tears while watching "Chapayev" with excitement and indignation; and we have seen "Female Hero" which describes a pitiful, tragic, and miserable life.</p>
<p>As historical films, they use progressive viewpoints, stand on a higher level, and use the most tragic facts to educate later generations and inspire future generations with strategies and methods of struggle.</p>
<p>It is an epic of struggle, a march praising the revolution! "Chronicle of Heroes' Bloody Battles" undoubtedly deserves to be admired. It explains the reasons for the failure of the struggle more than "Pugachev," and it describes the heroic struggle of the proletariat more diligently than "Chapayev"!</p>
<p>The screenwriter uses the special convenience of film to give this protagonist – Shi Jibang La Jing – a soldier of humble origin – a profound portrayal of this great figure. In the process of revolution, only the proletariat is the most determined group, and what they maintain is a heart of justice and sincerity for the struggle for national liberation.</p>
<p>In this film, we see the power of the masses and the tendency of the people. The director has excellent skills. He emphasizes Shi Jibang La Jing's determination and criticizes the fact that unplanned actions will lead to failure. Especially at the end, Peter Luo’s and others’ facial muscles are tense, and the masses lower their heads and shed tears, which contrasts with how much the people mourn the martyrdom of this hero.</p>
<p>Truly, this is a magnificent, majestic, and rough giant painting!</p>

<p>Zhang Cangqiu heard that Xu Jing had been hit by a hidden weapon and fallen behind him. Although he wanted to turn back to help, he was furious in his heart and refused to let the enemy go. He stomped his feet, chased after him, and shouted, "You dog thief, dare to hurt people with hidden weapons! Tonight, even if you go to heaven, I will catch up to you in heaven, and if you enter the earth, I will chase you down to earth. Where do you think you can escape?" The man ran while still not answering. With a twist of his body, another sleeve arrow flew towards Zhang Cangqiu's chest. Zhang Cangqiu swept his precious sword downwards, knocking the sleeve arrow to the ground. He then said, "How many sleeve arrows do you have? Just keep shooting them all." Seeing that the two arrows had missed him, the man was a little panicked. Just as he was about to shoot the third arrow, he stumbled on a stone and couldn't help but fall down. Zhang Cangqiu was overjoyed and sprinted in front of the man, raising his sword to strike down. But the man suddenly performed a carp leap, jumped up, and swung a hammer backhand towards Zhang Cangqiu's waist. Zhang Cangqiu missed his strike, and the hammer had already reached his waist. He had no choice but to jump forward, dodging the hammer, and turning around to swing his sword at the man's lower body. The two fought together again. Zhang Cangqiu was determined to catch him and would not let him go. The man only had a hammer in his hand and was afraid of being cut by Zhang Cangqiu's precious sword, so he struggled for a dozen moves before fleeing again towards the official road ahead. Zhang Cangqiu couldn't catch him and was burning with anger. He hurriedly chased after him, thinking that this guy's night walking and jumping skills were indeed good. If he escapes, how can I face Xu Jing? And I don't know how Xu Jing is doing after being injured? While thinking, he chased after him. He could see the city walls ahead, and there was a large manor on the east side of the official road, surrounded by winding walls, indicating a wealthy family. The man ran to the back of the manor, leaped up, and was already on the wall, falling into the manor. Zhang Cangqiu thought that this must be a den of thieves. Since he has already come here, no matter if it is a tiger's den or a dragon's pool, he must chase him in. So he followed with a leap and also reached the wall. (End of Chapter Two)</p>
