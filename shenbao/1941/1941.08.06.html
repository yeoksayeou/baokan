<p>社評</p>
<h3>由征服到突圍</h3>
<p>德蘇大戰，已經六個禮拜了。德國事前散佈的六個禮拜解決蘇聯全部戰事機構的誇語，到現在，已經成了幻滅的泡影，而且從形勢看起來，不獨德國擊潰蘇聯根本不能，即使要轉而另闢途徑，衝出一條血路，或者退取守勢，保持納粹在歐洲兩年來所得的一些戰果，也成了大問題。</p>
<p>希特勒統制世界野心之大，是空前的，而迷信武力萬能，也是空前的。因爲如此，他就發明了所謂「閃電戰」，處處以孤注一擲的姿態出現，如不能澈底的勝，就祇有壓根兒慘敗。過去兩年，德軍在歐洲造下了許多非常輝煌的成績，每决都是澈底得勝，迅速得勝的具體說明。可是，在這决德，蘇大戰裏，牠所遭遇的境况，却不獨與波蘭，北歐。巴爾幹等幾决大戰不同，甚至與在西歐對英。法。比。荷的大戰來比擬，也完全兩樣了。以前牠幾乎每决都是一戰而勝，沒有聽到過所謂「一次攻勢」與「二次攻勢」。而這回對蘇的戰爭裏，甚至連第一度大規模的攻勢，也完全遭到了頓挫，據說目前正在準備第三度的巨大進攻。現在値得注意的，牠的攻擊力量，顯然的，一次比一次來得薄弱。而値得疑問的，到底牠的資源與全部力量，，還可以允許牠再發動幾决大的進攻？一到德國覺到而且承認進攻爲徒勞時，一到牠的資源與全部力量不允許牠再繼續進攻時，必然的，牠就祇有退而採取守勢，或者轉而另闢蹊徑，併力攻擊一二軍事經濟要點，企圖突出重圍。</p>
<p>所以，這兩天來所傳德國攻擊已經偏重南路烏克蘭的消息，如果不算傳之太早的話，那末，德國當局或許已經到了承認解決蘇軍全部爲不可能，而在企圖突圍，亦未可知；而且，傳說中在準備著的，所謂第三次全綫攻勢，也就未必會馬上出現。這將要形成歷史上從未有過的，大規模的突圍戰役。</p>
<p>德。義選擇烏克蘭這一路突圍的意義，在經濟上，當然是奪取當地農產品，石油等一切豐富資源，進一步圖謀中東，印度；而在戰略上，則是衝出一條血路，幻想通過英、美·蘇陣綫中比較薄弱的一隅，由中東，印度地，達到和牠們東方同盟者日本携手的目的，截斷英·美·蘇間的陸上聯繫，從而包圍蘇聯。總目標呢，當然是企圖衝出英·美·蘇三國佈下的層層經濟與軍事的封鎖及圍擊，期望挽回牠們必敗的命運。而與德。義向烏克蘭進攻呼應着，日本也同時在東方發動了對亞洲東南部的進攻，緊接佔領全部越南之後，又在積極向泰國進逼。雖然目前東西侵略者之間的距離，還是非常遙遠，但到了現在，當牠們覺出對於反侵略陣綫的中·美·英·蘇·個別擊破及征服爲無望之後，則共同舉行最後突圍，乃是必有的事；而由越南一直到中東，這一個防務比較空虛的地帶，當然恰是侵略者覬覦目標之所在。</p>
<p>一直到目前爲止，雖然英·美·蘇對於東西侵略勢力的對付，在程度上，不免有輕重之分；對德，義的包圍封鎖圈，經濟方面，已經到了全面縮緊，非常嚴密的地步，軍事方面也到了不惜動用全部力量，向澈底擊潰德。義的目標邁進；而對於日本，經濟方面現在僅僅止於凍結資金及停止貨運等部份動作，軍事方面一切佈置，也還是偏重防禦，暫時或不至有主動進攻。但由性質上說起來，却是軍事與經濟並重，正義與侵略絕對不能並存，在東西兩方，是毫無二致的。即使太平洋大戰不爆發，一到西方侵略者被擊潰，正義力量共建世界的時候，東方侵略者的命運，也就不問可知。面對着這兩個包圍圈，侵略者要想挽救共同覆亡，當然就祇有分別進攻烏克蘭及威脅土耳其，以及侵佔越南和壓迫泰國了。</p>
<p>可是，侵略者突圍及實際打成一片企圖的成功可能，其實是非常渺小的。以西方說，德·義進攻烏克蘭及威脅土耳其的成敗如何；且不說；即使在牠們集中力量攻擊這一角時，蘇聯當然可以趁機由明斯克一路大舉反攻，英。蘇可以合作攻擊波羅的海及北歐各國，英國可以開始在歐陸反攻，或甚至英。蘇一致攻入巴爾幹，切斷德。義至烏克蘭的路綫，這些，都可使德。義伸入中東的迷夢，化爲粉粹，至於東方侵略者軍事力量之薄弱，及其經濟對外依靠之深，允其決定了牠任何冒險企圖的必歸失敗。</p>
<p>總之，侵略勢力的對外征服與擴張，已經完全成爲過去了，今後祗有突圍或退守，而結果之爲失敗則一。反侵略陣綫既已結成，則對侵略者非圍困即總攻，任何自私或破壞的行動，現在已告永遠絕跡。</p>

<p>在孔邸睡得非常舒適，早餐時有咖啡及牛奶。十時我和威德（ieddy.White）到王外長府上純粹作初决拜訪。十時半回來，汽車正在熙攘的大街上行進威德突然說：一有空襲」。我沒有覺得什麼，但他已注意到人行道上的人開始在奔避。於是我立刻注意到每一個人都跑得極快，店家紛紛趕上排門。我們同到室中，一切都很安靜，但僕人已在我們室中包紮箱篋。我們立刻再儘快的跑到街上。此時全市已在遷徙之中。孔邸門前的街上擠滿着來自平民區的人民。每人都帶有箱籠物件，更多的人抱了嬰孩逃警報。大孩子走在路上比較沉着　點。我們轉了一灣，只見一道非常整齊的人流漸漸回山下傾瀉。等我們走到大街時，交通擁塞不堪。汽車喇叭嘟嘟小停。卡車與擠滿了人的大汽車揚起抹塵。</p>
<p>此時第一次警報已經殷出，意謂日機正在、小時前離開漢口，現方飛人四川境內。飛機也許並不直抵重慶這還得等待半小時以後的第二次警報，才可確定。對河美大使館正要設宴招待我們。孔博士特派照料我們的位秘書，要求我們到防空洞中去躱一躱。但威德知道時間尚充分，我們隨即迂迥繞道赴河邊碼頭。</p>
<p>一艘外觀並不甚大的汽船答應把我們渡過長江，但駛到對岸後，汽船却不把我們送到還要向下游駛一哩光景的大使館所在地。汽船直開到那岸，把我們留在廣闊的沙地河岸邊。於是有一個很客氣的衛警要我們跑到離沙岸遠一點。另一個衛警招呼我們再要遠一點。威德於是說了一聲「唉，」衛警揚着喜悅喃喃同我們說，委員長立即要來。</p>
<p>果然有二汽船駛近碼頭——第一艘大點，船上跳下二十個身穿藍灰便服的人，站在小徑兩旁，有一輛光彩奪目的汽車守在那裏。於是在方才渡我們過來的小汽船中走出一位身材細長的人物，頭戴萃帽。身穿黑色半制服式的服裝。他走着輕快的有秩序的步伐，每跨一把步黑手杖向下一點。他走時把草帽略揚，我們見他把頭一點，於是即坐入汽車中。過了一分鐘，我們即乘坐了亞洲二百五十年來自康熙以後中國最偉大領袖的汽船，向下游駛去</p>
<p>我們在兩山聳峙的河中行時，可以望見重慶這一邊不少人民向山洞中去躱避，在大使館碼頭邊，麥許少校（MajorMeHugh）和我們遇見，他對於我們所坐的汽船和所來的方向覺得奇怪。我們坐進山轎，最先注意到的一艘平底美國砲艦泊在叫面有岩石的港中，港　的大小止好容納這艘砲艦（未完）</p>

<h3>中中交農四行　受委託經營外滙</h3>
<p>美政府已發給四行照會　以收會未凍結部份為限</p>
<p>自美英先後頒佈凍強求中日資金後、上海美·英商各銀行已奉訓令實施凍結、並為維護正當貿易、授予花旗·滙豊等十四家銀行特種照會、賣外匯供給進出口商人之需要、新聲社記乾昨向中中交農四行探悉、美國政府頃發給中央·中國·交通·中國農民·等四銀行特　照會、准許與十四家友邦銀行同親買賣外滙、是英辦法、業已於昨日下午二時、由美駐滬總領事根據給四行總行之咨文、抄送一份送達四行上海分行、該項咨文所規定、與美攻府前所頒佈之五十八號及五十九號一般照會相同、惟其範圍、限於外匯收　之未凍結部份、至於經營外滙之其他華商銀行、亦包括在內、在美之中國資金、經中國政府特別核准者、则不在此限、至四行接到美政府委託之經營外匯辦法、詳細內容、待日後正式發表云、</p>
<p>合法需要繼續供給</p>
<p>俄文新生活報云、自日本資金被凍結後、英美曾徇中國政府請求、對中國資金亦予凍結、本埠中外人士、迄今仍在密切注視其發展、本報記者乃走訪此間名經濟及貨幣學專家凱恩氏（Kann　）叩詢其對上海金融前途之意見、記者首問凍　中國資金在中國經濟上、究將發發生何種影響、據凱氏答稱、因時間短促、尚無法察悉實行凍結今後之結果、記者復詢本埠各銀行為實施此項命令、究將採用何種新措置、據答、銀行方面、刻正嚴執行新法令、唯對本埠商界合法需要、此時似不致中止供給、截至目前為止、私人存放於銀行中之美　、仍可提取、但該項美匯係照市價折合法幣支付、</p>
<p>生活費用亦無問題</p>
<p>至對「對存」英鎊、如何處理問題、若干銀行為防止資金逃避起見、曾賂倫敦方面請示辦法、業已於前日（四日）接奉詳細訓令、據稱、依據此項訓令、為（一）正當輪入而能證實其用途者、（二）凡運往中國、而有文件證明者、均可申請銀行、核准供給外匯、自無拒絕之理、此外、如係專恃此項外匯存款以維持生活者、在某種程度內、亦可使其滿足、他如以金鎊支付保險費、及匯往國外充敎育費等、亦不難獲得外匯、此項辦法、在美匯方面亦同磁適用、</p>
<p>法幣地位益臻鞏固</p>
<p>談至此、記乾繼詢凍結令對影響、渠云、此舉對法弊殊為有利、以各銀行之美匯存戶、爭先拋售美匯、而易取法幣也、惟對本市輪入方面、因國際局勢動盪不定、及國外「禁運」項目之增加、已大形低落、凱氏於結論時、曾述及法幣之前途、據謂今後法幣地位、仍將屹立如故、且有種種　象、可斷言必能更加改善、</p>
<h3>太古北洋輸順天號　政府電令徵調</h3>
<p>該綫現僅存新北京一艘　英輪漸少美輸繼續通行</p>
<p>長江綫外商航業、受中日戰事影響、惙航迄今逾四載、南北洋航綫英輪、則仍照常維持、惟行駛北洋各口之英輪、時遭日方為難、</p>
<p>檢疫停駛</p>
<p>最近太古公司北洋綫正班輸順天號、原定上星期六（二日）中午、由滬裝載客貨、赴威海衛烟臺至天津、啓椗前、忽接海關檢疫處通知、對赴華北旅客、須檢騐大使、該輸逐中止出口、辦理檢騐手續、頂定本星期一（四日）中午北駛、</p>
<p>電令徵調</p>
<p>不料屆時醫生證未給、乃又改於下午五時離埠、而屆時該項醫生證又見發給、公司又導報明改昨晨十時起程、不意昨晨忽接香港電令　調、該輪即宣告停駛北洋、有乘客六百餘人、通知登　退票、此次裝有茶葉·苞米·土紙·疋并頭·棉紗等貨、日內即將起出、一俟貨物卸清、南駛星島應　、</p>
<p>僅存一輪</p>
<p>該公司北洋綫正班輸原有盛京·順天新輪行駛、盛京號已於本年三月史徵發赴星、調新北京輸替盛京輸行駛北洋綫正班、今順天輪又復　、嗣後太古公司北洋綫祇剩新北京輪一艘行駛、公司是否別再調輪接替、現尚無表示、新北京輪今日可由華北返滬、預定九日駛津、兼灣威海衛烟臺、</p>
<p>保和航輸</p>
<p>又訊、英商保和輸船公司所屬各輪、因歐戰關係、遠東綫至香港為止、本市已不來、該公司大班Mr.N.H.Lacey因不久亦將離滬返英服役、前日（四日）對有關商行發出通告、聲明市公司寫字間照常辦公、惟大班職務委託北京路號泡立生台維（譯音）洋行大班Mr.S.C.Smith氏代理、該洋行已接受所請故前日發出共同通告照上述各情、遠東英輪逐漸减少、至太平洋綫美輪仍舊維持、貨輪緝絡續不絕到滬、郵船約十一日有一艘由美抵滬、翌日　香港小呂宋、另有柯立芝總統號由舊金山經續香山、直放小呂宋、約下週二由小呂宋經香港來滬、次日返美、日本不　、</p>
<h3>白賽仲路等轄權　劃歸福煦捕房</h3>
<p>自本年八月三日起、法　界貝當捕房管轄區內白賽仲路·麦琪路、及　格路中之地段、割歸福煦抽房管轄、故在　　地段內之居民、嗣後如有事故、須向法捕房接洽時、請向　　路三〇七號福煦捕房（電話七〇一六〇號）接洽可也、</p>
<h3>日圖攫取　華中鑛產</h3>
<p>日方因國內資源缺乏、竟圖在華中各處、攫取各種軍火原料、以延續其戰爭機構、日前曾由　亞院華中聯絡　長太田乖前往磊冶·馬鞍山·等鑛區視察、以便　　「開發」、隨行者有　亞院持術部長本多靜雄、據日文人陸新報記載、本多頃已返抵南京、曾發表談話、據調「大冶、馬鞍山·桃冲在鳳凰山等處各鐵鑛質地極為佳良、超出一般預料之外、其中尤以馬鞍山　鑛、其鐵分占百分之六十、實為世界上無可匹敵之良鑛、若能加以電氣採取、則華中煤鐵　、即能自給自足、興亞院今後將根據此項視察所得、實行改良技術、加緊開採、以期大量生產」、</p>
<h3>美孚火油船　被日扣留</h3>
<p>駛往江北十一圩　被日艦扣留押回</p>
<p>行駛中國沿海之英輪、時遭日方歧視、檢查扣留、種種為難、即美輪亦怕難免、近有美孚火油公司運輸火油之小輸美耀號、於上月一十九日由滬裝載火油、赴長江下游江北十　圩起卸、習日扺目的地、該處適有戰事關係、不能　貨、乃即開回來滬、中途遇日艦、遭受檢查、被押駛至　淞口外、拋泊監視、於上星期六（　日）晨始駛進口、當駛美孚碼頭停靠、惟仍然有日兵監視、忽於前日（四日）上午十時一刻、日方用小輪拖至十六·十六A號浮筒停泊、至下午一時、又拖至蘭路海關碼頭停靠、復於是日下午五時、再拖至十六·十六　A號浮筒停泊、今仍泊該浮筒、美孚公司對美耀被扣事、已據實呈報美駐滬領署、現正交涉、昨　該公司稱、該輪所裝之火油、係本行貨、並無嫌欵、大致二三日內即可釋放、</p>
<h3>法租界公共交通　昨日恢復兩缐</h3>
<p>派有武裝巡捕隨車保護　當局再行調處卽可解決</p>
<p>法商水電公司工人要求津貼、於前日起怠工後、公司為維持界內交通、昨日由武裝巡捕隨畫保護、先行恢復第一路及第七路有軌電車行駛、法捕房政治部等、已設法再行調處、並勸告工人先行復工、靜待合理之解決、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>勉强通車</p>
<p>車務機務兩部工人怠工後、法租界內各路有軌無軌電車以及公共汽車完全停駛、同時公共租界英商電車公司車輛暫停駛入法租界、公司當局為維持界內交通計、昨起先行恢復第一路十六舖至福開森路、第七路十六舖至善鐘路海格路、由捕房於每輛車上派武裝巡捕二　、隨車保護、至於其餘種路有軌電車及無軌電車、二十一路與二十二路公共汽車、公司亦擬設法擇重要路綫、陸續恢復行駛、</p>
<p>設法調處</p>
<p>法捕房政治部等勸告工人先行復工、靜待合理之解決、昨日已由當局與工人代表會談、恊商解決辦法、俟與工人接洽妥當後再行與公司大班接洽、聞此次工潮爭執之點、為津貼問題、並不十分嚴重、工人方面認為公司允增津貼、即可恢復工作、為以司方面對增加津貼原則接受、所以是項怠工風潮、不致擴大、即可解決、</p>
<p>實屬誤會</p>
<p>近來報紙登載上海法商電車公司華籍職員七月份加薪一成半、而其法籍職員則加新五成、此種不同之待遇、似為引起工人不滿之主要原因、致釀成此次罷工風潮、其實上說係出於誤會、為大衆利益計、似有說明眞相之必要、且此舉對於復工之努力、不無裨益、蓋復工之舉、當為三方當事人即公衆·工人·及公司所贊成、</p>
<p>加薪成數</p>
<p>查法籍職員及華職員　月份之加薪、係就各種不同之項目而為之、若就臨時比例津貼而言、固可謂一方面係照底薪加五成、一方面係照底薪加一成半、但須知若將華籍及法籍職員各項所加之總數比較之、則二方面職員所昨加薪之總數、實為百分之十、</p>
<p>同情考慮</p>
<p>再者、當工人決定罷工時、公司當局已對工會聲明、對於華籍職員再度加薪、願意予以同情之考慮、公司當局對於此點、井未改易主張、如此、則此次罷工、旣對於滬市之繁榮有　　益、理應立卽解　、</p>
<p>派捕保護</p>
<p>法商水電公司包括自來水·電燈·電車·公共汽車等、今車務機務全體工人雖完全怠工、以致電車公共汽車停駛、惟自來水供給、以及電氣之發電、因有外籍工人工　、所以決無斷絕之慮、今　家灣之法電工廠、業已由法捕房派大批中西探捕及法駐軍、在四週嚴密戒備、以　保護、各馬路之發電　、亦派武裝巡捕駐守、呂班路公司門前、亦派探捕駐守保護、</p>
<h3>楊梅南昨日大殮</h3>
<p>英商太古公司前華總經理梅南氏、於本月三日病故滬寓、昨假　國殯儀館大殮、已誌昨報、茲悉楊氏　近始　其督敎、故昨日大　時、用耶穌儀式、異常隆重、楊氏生前交游頗廣、往弔者數百人、太古公司大班安獻金氏、亦新臨弔唁、太古公司曁所屬各輪、昨日繼續下半旗誌哀、</p>
<h3>部令工商各業實行　提存特別準備</h3>
<p>公積金外提存特別準備　非常時期保護鞏固各業</p>
<p>經濟部為　護並鞏固工商業起見、制定「非常時期工商業提存特別準備辦法」、業已通令各地商會轉飭各同業公會一體遵照辦理、上海租界區域各工商業、凡係依公司法組織者、均已遵令　施、規定每屆營業年度終了有盈餘時、除依法令提存公積金等之規定外、應提存特別準備、　盈餘在實收資本總額五分之一以上者、提盈餘百分之十、　盈餘在實收資本總額四分之一以上者、提盈餘百分之二十、　盈餘在實收資本總額三分之一以上者、提盈餘百分之三十、特別準備應專款存儲銀行、於營業年度終了後　個月內、由各工商業自行提存、特別準備除提補　　損失外、非經經濟部核准、不得分派、凡未將特別準備提存足額、或有偽　情事、經查出後、得依公司法第一百三十二條之規定論罪、</p>

<h3>金融　轟轟烈烈凍結外匯　原來是偷偷摸摸　照樣可買空賣空　倒是一般物價却借此抬高不少</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌各匯皆平、美英匯暗市、已漸恢復一月廿六日美英相繼凍結中日資金前常態、中外投機家僅須借一某洋行及公司名義照常仍可扒塞、已起活動來結、九月期英美匯均有新交易做開、一塲轟轟烈烈凍結外匯之舉、到如今暗中照樣可以買空賣空、未受影響、倒是一般物價、都借此抬高不少、美孚油洋行亦有扒進、外商銀行雖有供售、不免扳價、致美金晨開五元二一八七五、不久即難結、步趨軟化、華商投機家及進口商活動加厲、傾向扒進、致匯豐小櫃檯美匯改縮至五元一二五、對於較巨結款供給美匯爲五元、故有今後外銀行將照上價維持說、價遂步緊至收市、比上日軋緊甚鉅、交易轉盛、</p>
<p>投機商異常活躍</p>
<p>自晨外電印銀獨縮、美英皆平、各國匯兌一致未更、中央掛牌各匯皆平、內盤早開銀行賣價現貨均平英匯三辦士一〇九三七五、美金五元二一八七五、聞美孚油洋行首來扒結進八月美金五元二一八七五、俄即難結勢趨軟化、匯豐掛牌未更、白銀平衡稅仍微百分之二四·二五、匯豐小櫃檯美匯仍五元一八七五、華商投機家更形活躍口用進商名義紛扒英金三辦士〇九三七五、及八九月美金五元一八七五、新交易頗多、聞更有羅比扒進、外商英美行大多均有售出、午刻局勢趨穩、午收英金三辦士〇九三七五、美金五元一八七五、</p>
<p>結果英美同見緊</p>
<p>下午進口商奮扒益勇、致匯豐小櫃檯美匯改縮〇六二五、爲五元一二五、投機家亦在暗中扒進、後聞匯豐對於較鉅結款價已改縮至五元、市况更緊至三點半收市、現貨至九月期、爲英匯三辦士〇六二五、美金五元一二五、比上日收價、英緊〇四六八七五、美緊〇九三七五、　偏向黃金爭逐鹿　頂盤見八千五百五十元</p>
<p>昨日烚赤暗市、沉靜局勢、突告活躍、因外匯現有九月期新交易做開、又處於投機家扒風趨緊、並謠港電來維持本市美匯僅五元、各方人心頓起振奮、匯票商證券號力進於前、一利及金號幫收吸繼後、故價由六千六百九十六元、步見上升、下午漲勢加銳、躍達六千七百七十元、後以新豐永復出、祥興永吐售、漲風始息、終見軋升六十七元、全日交易轉盛、共五六萬兩、現金再度飛漲、上午先由銀樓幫售予證券幫五十兩、價八千四百元、又出余號三十兩、爲八千四百三十元、某銀樓又與大豐各出新豐永三十兩、爲八千四百五十元、午刻成記出銀樓五十兩、價八千四百三十元、下午成記又出益大一百兩、又合盛四十兩、價八千四百三十元、後少賣戶、價飛抬再漲、同康永進熾大十兩、價爲八千五百五十元空前高峯、後八千五百元始有買、軋升一百四十元、飾金亦漲十五元、計八百七十元、</p>
<p>期貨猛漲六十七元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、九點十五分開市爲六千七百元、比上日收價高九元、外匯報緊、新豐永。大豐。益大。德孚來買進、頓見盤上二十餘元、十點光景升至六千七百二十六元、爲鑫源。成記售出、當見回下至六千七百十五元左右、十一點光景立泰。益大及散戶均來售、再降二十元、入六千七百元內、遜至六千六百九十六元、奈外匯帶鬆、鼎盛。大豐。同康永收吸、散戶拖進、回升二十餘元、哄至六千七百二十元、浮多脫手、正午收市六千七百十二元、下午二點開市六千七百十五元、計開高三元、繼稍回下至六千七百零五元、忽見一利。祥和。益大。德成來傾向猛進、且聞外匯步緊、有美匯今後本市將維持五元傳說、人心大振、價在一致買風中、飛上六十餘元、哄達六千七百七十元、嗣爲鼎盛。新豐永·祥興永力售、始止漲回小二十元、至六千七百五十元、三點半收市六千七百五十八元、比上日猛漲六十七元、照八月美金五元一二元結價、爲六千七百九十五元、計撳三—七元、收後平、當日有七十四元差度、金號本牌金、門市售價八千五百五十元、收進比售出低二百元、</p>
<p>飾金掛八百七十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩售出價、大同行及新同行均初掛五十五元、十一點升十元、至下午三點半叉升五元、計八百七十元、軋升十五元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣漲多跌少</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤期現俱漲、英美金鎊因亦各漲五元、英金票趨勢平穩、市價站平、美金票開盤一千九百二十四元、開後盈泰祥興等購買、抬至三十元、仁泰永同興售出、退爲二十三元、午收六十七元、午後開盤二十六元、開後同興東升　恒祥源永順豐等購買、抬至四十一元、仁泰永售出、退爲一千九百三十八元收盤、比上日軋升十八元、現貨亦升至十九元二角半、香港票趨勢堅穩、市價站平、坎拿大票及澳金票均趨漲勢、日金票及朝鮮票均稍趨跌、前者退爲二元一角八分、後者降爲一元七角四分、</p>
<h3>證券　公債補空為多　—回漲一元左右—</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市繼續趨漲、爲勢愈勁、夷考其實、大多數均爲補空交易、新多者竟鳳毛麟角、絕少動辦、因補空市價上漲、浮多乘勢出籠、市價連漲三日、已高起二元數角、補空交易已漸覺滿足、尤以午後爲烈、一日間又續漲一元左右、愼防回風、昨上午大豐易中和豐積記補空於前、聘和久豐及公茂續補於後、聯益亦稍有補進、德昌大中九成協興元乘高出籠、鴻大益昌潤德怡泰亦有賣出、午收即好六七角、午後聯和久豐繼續補空、同康協大潤德天生隨勢吸收、丙種竟抬出六十八元關、益記仁豐同興及協興元乃乘高出籠、九成亦機續賣出、本爲空頭檯面、三日來之轉移、又變成多頭檯面矣、市價結果、續漲七角至一元二角之多、成交的二百三四十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交商務印書館股五十股、價爲九十五元、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市開盤穩定、嗣因謠言又見回低、收盤尚堅、全日交易頗多、祥泰股自九十三元半回跌至九十元半、橡皮股仍呆、</p>
<h3>紗花　業中多空皆有　紗市昂中帶軟　實銷似亦不振</h3>
<p>紗市由盤旋而上升、但趨勢又在飄盪不定中、實則現紗銷路不旺、香港幫僅辦三二支、四十支。四二支紗綫共計六十包、對於二十支紗只包未、所以雙馬廠單價格曁高、拋空者尚不　人、惟　證券幫稍有拖進看漲、至於同業方面、多空皆有、因之市盤昂中帶軟、又有人說、雙馬廠單如果近一千六百兀左右、拋空者較爲活跚、所以在些六百元關口、恐有一度爭持也、不過目前取引所紗布價格、因買多而賣少、市勢殊堅、影響雙馬廠單也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千五百九十元、低價爲一千五百六十元、午後初做一千五百七十二元、逐步跌至一千五百六十四元、繼後標金良好、隨即升至一千五百八十五元、最後價爲一千五百八十元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、人氣良好、買者頗湧、首盤價爲一千五百八十元、少頃漲至一千五白八十四五元、在此盤站立甚久、但粤幫銷路冷澹、二十支紗交易全無、僅辦三二支四　支紗寥寥幾包、然檯面多頭拖力頗强、逐步上升至一千五百九十元、不料高價一現、謠言復熾、同時取引所價下降十餘元、一時塲中賣聲大振、一鬆二三十元、低盤見一千五百六十元、然盈利人乘機扒空、又復回升至一千五百七十二元收盤、查半日間成交統計七千五百六十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港六〇　同行七、五〇〇</p>
<p>統計七、五六〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期紗市况、晨初開市、續承上日漲風、金號暨證券商一致購進、八十兩月各漲四元、九月漲二元、開後新買與補空仍衆、八月曾高至一千四百六十元、九月一千五百三十四元半、十月一千五百元十二元、入後盛傳日蘇衝突、多頭紛起轉賣、八月復小至一千四百四十八元、九月一千五百十八元、十月一千五百二十六元、漸即梢回、午收八月跌半元九月跌五元、十月跌五元半、成交一萬二千零九十包、後市初仍疲軟、入後新買與補空復殷、價重趨升、允以八月回漲爲多、餘月略和緩、晚收八月比上日漲七元、九月漲半元、十月跌半元、全日成交一萬八千包、比上日增加五千八百五十包、再將全日開收高低價錄左、（係凈盤叫價）</p>
<h3>棉市良好如故</h3>
<p>現棉情况、仍帶堅挺之象、但廠需並不十分發展、棉商心思一致向上、所以情態較爲良好也、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠洋行外棉定貨交易、雖國際情勢仍屬相當緊張、但因美印棉來源頗稀、同時海外棉市更屬堅實、故一部分花號家及外商紗廠購意尚稱熱烈、昨日除巴西棉之定購較爲平淡外、對於印棉之購買、甚爲踴躍也、</p>
<p>紐的棉市、先因同業買進而漲、後又因南方幫套賣、及多頭獲利了結回跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日的跌十一二磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因棉商售出、及多頭獲利了結而跌、但縯後又因空頭扺補、及現貨商買進回漲、結果昨日收盤價格、除白洛去七八月份跌一羅比外、其餘各漲的五六羅比、又預測今日開盤市况看跌二·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布疋大批運港　售盤又告提漲</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市因運港各布續有大批裝出、染廠及客幫採辦增旺、廠方根子甚緊、故手貨售盤又告提漲、白貨細布斜紋每疋漲五角左右、粗布每疋漲二角半、漂染布漲五角之譜、本街成交各布八百餘件、粤港幫辦漂染布六百餘件、南洋幫辦粗細布斜紋漂布等三百餘件、北路烟津幫綫呢絨布粗細布等二百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　昨取引所先疲後漲、趨勢堅定、而現貨市塲則以實需續吒、繼漲增高、白貨細斜每疋漲一角半至五角、龍頭細布提升一角半、收盤爲五十二元七角半、色貨四君子嗶嘰因津幫與本街搜羅、漲風獨健、新稅新單已步升至一元七角四分、新單老稅一元七角二分七釐半、老單老稅一元六角七分七五、</p>
<h3>糧食　公賣米應市　米價難抬</h3>
<p>昨洋米逐步趨跌、期現兩貨一致下游、比之前市又小二三元不等、蓋目下存底充實、新到不絕、凡前定六七月份之爪哇茄佛緬暹各米均將决第抵申、浮多散戶勢難大量貯藏、隨在市絡繹拋出、而新囤旣呆、實消又淡、本街有港越公賣米應市、更乏暢胃、皮球幫亦乏操縱之機會、市價乃至不能支持而下跌矣、英華司碎米已自一百零四元外小至一百零三元、二號暹米現一百三十六元、期一百三十七八元、小絞現一百四十六元半、期一百四十六元小至一百四十五元半、收盤較之前市、又甩落二三元不等、計一號西貢高自百三十一元至百二十九元、二號百二十元、陳百二十四兀、一號暹羅百二十六元半、冲一號百二十元、二號百十七八元、敏黨高百三十元零五角、决百二十二元、百二十元、茄佛米百二十六七元、小絞銀行棧初自百二十元、後僅百十八元、外棧自百十九元半、後至百十七元、决百十五六元、碎尖九十一元、九十元、成交現米七千多包、英華司七百噸之譜、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、亦以價高銷滯、及來源續旺、售心鬆軟、繼呈跌風、若南港早晚稻祇開百五十元至百四十七元、計落三三元之巨、其無錫原包白粳、則賴貨稀較爲拷住、仍僅貶短元砠而已開百四十五元、糯米受各貨影響、相隨帶軟元許、開香港白元高自百二十四五元次至百二十元、國糯百二十五六元、糯菉未開、</p>
<p>浦東新粳業已上市、共計七石、由五豐泰廠碾白出售、開百五十六元、不過前市米樣先出、預爲推售、昨則方堪稱爲正市耳、至於米品雖今庚雨水欠調、但身骨尚屬不劣、與去年相仿、據說有八成年稔、</p>
<h3>粉價略挫　洋粉續到六千包</h3>
<p>昨粉市因客胃依然靜寂、而囤戶亦不感興趣、價乃繼續下游、惟金龍粉進出較爲活絡、開盤爲卅一元五角、旋銳降至三十一元一角、於是囤戶又來問津、趁低吸收、遂逐步回好至三十一元五角半、比前日尚小一角、本粉爲三十四元、餘乏成交</p>
<p>又洋麵粉續有運來、太古公司漢陽輪咋午抵埠由香港裝來麵紛六千包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白回振</h3>
<p>昨粗白因連日步跌、降度已達四五元、價位漸宜、於是疲極回振、亦事理之常、公司期貨二四粗白八月十日期初爲一百元〇〇九角、旋升至〇一元半、復回至〇〇五角、終乃升至〇一元二角、二元、二元二角、一元八角、二元三角、升一元五角五分、八月二十日期个百〇一元九角、二元九角、一元九角、二元九角、復升至四元四五角、後稍鬆爲〇三元五角、六角半、比升一元一角半、公會現貨二四粗白七月份到貨一百〇一元八角、三元半、升二元五角、六月份一百〇〇三角至一元半、更正三元、五月份一百元〇〇五角、一元三角、二元五角、均升二元、</p>
<p>又糖五日進口、有三百包、由香港運來、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日凍結淪陷區生絲　絲業垂絕</h3>
<p>生絲自資金凍結以來、海外市塲、即已停止交易、本埠絲市、本週內雖仍有零星成交、唯此項生絲能吾出口、尚屬問題、因悉昨日東京來電、華中生絲亦予以凍結、不准出口、又據可靠方面消息、內地杭嘉湖一帶之小型絲廠、現今皆已停閉、華中亦已停止收買土絲、此項消息、可能證實上項電訊即能成爲事實、故目前本埠生絲出口、希望已屬微渺、而一部份賢明人士、均已向內地自由區發展、故本埠暨淪陷區之絲業雖已絕望、而廣大內地之絲業却蒸蒸日上也、</p>
<h3>蔗與蔗糖（三）（中國之部）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>我國人從什麽時候起纔會自己製造蔗糖呢？據，法國大百科全書說：「在極古的時候，中國人也知道—以前說了印度人，所以加一也字。—把甘蔗所含的糖分榨取出來：因爲在極古的陶瓷器上，人能找出他們製造糖漿技術的痕迹來。」不過這種痕迹究竟是「甘蔗」所遺留下的呢？抑或是我國人從自古以來就知道製造的那米藥麥芽的「飴餳所遺留下的呢？我們很難斷定。况說陶瓷器的眞僞年代也大有商量的餘地：所以這段話是不足爲憑的。眞實的說：我國人的開始學會製造蔗糖的年代，是有眞正國史記錄著的。按唐書西域傳上記載：「摩揭它（印度），貞觀二十一年——公元六四七年——始遺使自通於天子。太宗遣使取熬糖法；即詔揚州上諸蔗，榨瀋如其劑，色愈西域遠甚。』宋詩人陸游在所作老學庵筆記上補充這回可紀念的事跡說：「聞人茂德言：沙糖中國本無之。唐太宗時，外國貢至，問其使人：「此何物？」云：「以甘蔗汁煎。」用其法煎成，與外國等。』所以這公元七世紀中葉—六五〇左右—纔是我國人眞正自己會製造蔗糖的肇始呢。然而那時所造的，當然是那種原始的紅褐色的粗沙糖了。（未完）</p>

<h3>學生的品行問題</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>我和申報館，先後發生寫作上的關係，差不多已經有十幾個年頭了，所以申報的一切，時常使我覺得很關心；允其是它的朝氣蓬勃，充滿着活力的一點，使我一想起就感到很愉快。這一决申報助學金的創辦，其設計極爲周密，措施也很合理，但看半個月來各方捐款的踴躍，更令人非常興奮。</p>
<p>老友丁惠康醫師，和申報是並無關係的，可是他天性熱腸，什麼事都肯出錢出力，所以捐助得最多；（包括代募在內）這一件事很有力地感動了我，雖然我是一個精窮的文丐，力量很小，只能在我上月份所寫的「秋海棠」的稿費內，撥出三十元來作爲捐款，　我的心却同樣是沸滾的</p>
<p>文人寫作的收入，都很菲薄，所以我絕對不希望別的同文效法；因爲靠我們捐這一些錢，也實在太少了！我只求一班投機發財的先生們，把一大疊一大疊的新鈔票送進歌台舞榭去的時候，摸摸自己的良心，分出一半來捐充申報助學金；以上海發國難財者之多，我敢把我的腦袋來打賭，要是飽們都肯『慷慨解囊』的話，十萬二十萬也是不成問題的！</p>
<p>同時，我還要向主辦的幾位先生貢獻一句極重要的話，就是在核給助學金的時候，對於學生的品行，必須列爲第一要件。我們看到電影院前，跳舞塲裏那些打扮得像外國小流氓似的男學生，和舞女樣的女學生，心裹委實覺得非常悲痛；再像幾天前的報上，還登着一段三個靑年學生在路上調戲一個婦女，並且還打傷她丈夫的消息，這眞是太荒謬了！我不敢說上海的學生品行個個不好，可是品學兼優的却委實很少見。——學堂裹也根本不注意——可是我們知道，學問對於一個品行惡劣的人，其情形猶如猛虎添翼一樣。假使大家辛辛苦苦地捐來的錢，幫助品行惡劣的靑年去升學，這就未免太可惜了！所以我深切的盼望本報主事者能够特別注重這一點！當然，單是注意靑年們個別的行動還是沒有用的，一方面我們一定選要督促各學校改善訓育。</p>
<p>編者按：秦瘦鷗君以操觚所得，慷慨助學，自爲培植學子之最桂養料。謹代致謝。其於學子品行之意見，可謂　針見血，發人深省。本報對於請求助學金靑年之「學」「行調查，在多方面保持接觸，不厭求詳，務探其賾；此則正與奏君相合，可質諸讀者者。</p>
<h3>茶室見聞</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>托幾個自負「前進靑年」朋友的福，昨天「前進」到茶室裏去。</p>
<p>不吹牛，茶室確乎早去過一决了；但因爲前一决屬於「貴幹」，所以未曾觀摩。這一次旣屬「淸坐」，我當然打起阿Q欣賞小尼姑的神氣來了。</p>
<p>首先，注意到人物。似乎二十世紀全是靑年的天下。照例老頭子才該上茶室；可是遺憾得很，竟連一根長一點的鬍子都沒有！</p>
<p>第二，注意到談話。恕我，可憐我，一個字都聽不懂的！有些是非中國文，不懂；有些是門檻術語，不懂；，有些是「專門名字」，又不懂……</p>
<p>第三嗎？我的一個「前進靑年」朋友正在怒髮冲「司丹康」：「小×眞不漂亮××的×妹妹儘覇着一個人跳！」</p>
<p>以上見聞三則，俱爲事實，未敢造謠而「淆亂視聽」也。特此聲明。</p>
<h3>怎樣管理螢光燈</h3>
<p>— 仲涵</p>
<p>螢光燈不比鎢絲燈那樣簡便易於管理，啓閉允須謹愼，吾則燈泡易損，所費不贊，下述各點，敬希用戶特別注意：</p>
<p>（一）燈泡上的兩端或一端變爲深黑色，有時兩端附近發現許多黑中帶紫的圈環，這燈泡要不能用了。</p>
<p>（二）舊燈忽生閃爍，亦爲泡將失效之預示，新或未久用者，其病必在開啓機關，宜以新開關易之。</p>
<p>（三）通電後，燈不肯發光，或發光緩慢，其故在燈架裝置鬆動，接觸點不佳，電流不易通行所致，宜旋緊燈架。</p>
<p>（四）燈中部黑暗，僅兩端發光，病在啓用小圓筒失其調節作用。</p>
<p>（五）久用後燈泡每有細長之直紋發現，此因在內之水銀遇冷凝聚所致，有時燈泡放光時外遇冷物，水銀便凝，泡上任何部份，亦有黑色斑點發現，法將燈泡轉過百八十度裝上，則水銀可遇熱冉行蒸發。</p>
<p>（六）燈泡的兩端或一端忽有半英寸闊的黑圈圍繞燈泡及半的發現時，宜速換啓用具，吾則傷燈，其故在啓用電流太多也。</p>
<p>秋海棠的身子頓時晃了幾晃，彷彿就要暈倒似的，慌得梅寳趕快從地上爬起來，使出了全身的力氣給他攙扶着。</p>
<p>「鬆手，大家坐着說話吧！」秋海棠定了定神，火氣倒比方才退了許多　實却不敢就鬆手，依舊用力攙扶着他，讓他走到一張竹椅邊去坐下，自己忙着蹲下身子，把散滿了一地的瓦片收拾起來。</p>
<p>「謝天謝地，總算你還沒有把那張字據寫給他！」火氣退下去之後，他的精神便顯得很疲乏了，只能用極低的聲音，慢慢地說：「梅寳，唱戲也不是容易賺錢的事。你的年紀太小了，險些着了他們的道兒，從此可別再去啦！一個人什麽飯都可以吃，却千萬不要吃唱戲的飯！」</p>
<p>最後兩句話他簡直是一個字一個字說的，雖然聲音很低，但梅寳也不難聽出他心中的激憐來。</p>
<p>一現在我的病已經好了，小狗子的兄弟也還留在道裏幫忙，家裹我自己能够照料……。」他深深地嘆了一口氣，足足停頓了兩三分鐘，才能繼續冉往下說：「不管你明年能不能畢業，這半年至少也還有兩個多月剩着，你還是趕快給我進城去吧！」</p>
<p>梅寳把那些較大的碎片拾完之後，因爲地上還有許多磚屑和茶葉散在那裏，便隨手取過一柄掃帶來掃着。（一七七）</p>
<p>此時此地</p>
<h3>販報第一天</h3>
<p>— 星花</p>
<p>「讀書，讀了書有什麼用呢！我早說過，叫你到洋布店裹去學生意，你偏不肯。現在呢！高中畢了業，各處職業都我不到。找到了，又要一千元保證金，要是，當時去學了生意，績點工錢，老闆也好做了。喂！阿星，你不要嫌不好，現在只有販販報紙，補些家用。」</p>
<p>自家想想也覺慚愧，吃了家裏十幾年白米，現在高中畢了業，一點小職業也我不到。無怪爸爸要生氣。不過，去販報實在不願意。</p>
<p>「唉！阿星，不要以爲賣報的職業低微，難道，沒聽見大學生拉洋車的嗎？我看還是依了我的話。以後有高尚職業，仍舊可以改行的。吃家裏老米飯，總不好活一生一世的」</p>
<p>第二天，脫去了長衫，領了幾十份報，就在馬路上奔走。垂着頭，心裏像刺滿了劍。斜眼一瞧，四週的人都似乎在譏笑我。喉管裏像塞了木梗，只是喊不出。別的報販都緊張了聲帶：「老申報，新聞報，中美日報……要看到蘇聯反攻大勝嗄！」生意自然興隆了。</p>
<p>驀地，一輛流綫型汽車停在身傍，裏面跳下兩個人——一男一女。唉！男的偏偏是同學密司脫李，洋裝畢挺的。我急忙低了頭，裝做看報上的新聞</p>
<p>「喂！桃紅色新聞有喉。這是他的聲音。　「嗯！沒，沒有——」心裏一急，臉上通紅。</p>
<p>「那末，××影訊有　，」</p>
<p>「也沒有，沒，沒有——」</p>
<p>他對那女的說：</p>
<p>「這個報販，面怪熟。像在那裏見過？噢！想起了……。」</p>
<p>要是，當時路上有個洞，怕我已經鑽下去了。</p>
<p>「哼！難道這窮小子是你同學不成。別胡想了。快到×××去，下午，×××第一塲怪怕趕不上呢！」那女的說。他們上了車去了。</p>
<p>大恩人！大恩人。要是當時沒有這位女士，我的臉不知丟到什麽地方去了。來世作牛馬也報不了這大恩的。</p>
<p>抱了一疊報紙，呆立在馬路上。心裏想起了畢業時的盛况。「今天是桃李芬芳，明天是社會的棟樑。」</p>
<p>唉！楝樑？</p>
<h3>路不拾遺</h3>
<p>— 燿燿</p>
<p>一個小癟三用一個鑰匙在開啓弄堂口的一家人家的後門。</p>
<p>「你偷偷摸摸地在幹什麼？」一個巡捕走來大喝。</p>
<p>小癟三戰戰兢兢地：「先生，我因爲在這裹拾到一個鑰匙，不知道是那一家失掉的，所以我想在每一家的鬥上試一試，以便原物奉還。」說罷，一陣苦笑。</p>
<p>巡捕聽了，也笑着說：「這樣說來，你倒還有路不拾遺的美德哩！」</p>
<h3>佳話</h3>

<p>單是做一個衣服店門前的衣架，則人生沒有什麼價値了。（蕭伯納）</p>
<p>從開着的門走進去，有什麽希奇，撞開緊閉的門，才是難能而可貴。（拉辛）</p>
<h3>神經病</h3>
<p>— 張根源</p>
<p>我的腦子生了病，怕是神經病之類的病。</p>
<p>整天，我在用腦，我在思想，腦子常常從很輕的閃痛到幾乎震裂開來，我思想得太利害了，這是一定的，思想得太利害才會這樣痛，我一天到晚想些什麽呢！又是模模糊糊的，空空洞洞的，我不知道我會想出些什麼結果來，結果祗是强烈的頭痛，這是神經病哩！一定的，否則，我在發痴，我爲什麼要這樣使自己的腦子吃苦頭？</p>
<p>我不要想，可是不能不想；米的價錢，煤的價錢都漲得吃了人，我過去趁難得動腦筋的，如今却想多轉轉念顯了，不然，對不起那樣貴的米，煤和一切一切漲了價的東西了。</p>
<p>可是神經病一定是神經病哩？天上不會跌下來，思維有什麽用呢？</p>
<p>我不如人家，祗會得担心事，在這年頭兒想混口飯吃，難怪生起神經病來！</p>
<p>空想與神經病結了婚，嗚呼！</p>

<h3>劉派老生　陳鴻聲來滬演唱</h3>
<p>— 慕耘</p>
<p>居今日而談老生，幾全宗尚余馬譚三派，而三派之長，幾如異途同歸，皆爲靡靡之音，其所唱之腔，多就其本能天賦，以改造之也。洎乎近來，其情勢迺稍有變，蓋靡糜之音，寓亡國之兆，不若黃鐘大呂，大氣磅礴之足以啓發人之深省也。世之習余者多無嗓，迺就其丹田之音，以致力於奔放抑揚，其藝之精，其術之廣，未有甚於此者，然當世無伯樂，安知千里駒，不埋沒於草澤間哉！我友楊寳森陶畏初，胥爲學余之最力者，余之所唱，不僅其粗枝大葉，殆乎工尺之字，裏弦外弦，亦求其準。不如此視之爲辱余，其迷信之深，有如此者。迄於今臼，畏初且潦倒，寳森境况，亦未見大佳，反不若寳忠之知難而退，以琴問世之優裕閒散耳。</p>
<p>綜上所言，非譚余馬之不足學，亦非學之足以敗嗓。其實苟有天賦，殊不必斤斤於余馬與譚也。高慶奎人稱大雜拌，高旣倒嗓，人乃知嗓之可貴。宋寳羅出演天蟾，其所以紅者，嗓也。宋之嗓，五音不全，高處亢爽有餘，低則圓潤不足。尤爲宋之大病者，且不善唱，唱時多具雌昔，故宋上演，非其兄之琴不可。宋藝旣不足道，然何以紅？豈海上周郎，盡爲外行耶？曰，非也。宋以嗓紅耳。滬人久聞譚馬靡靡之音，驟易以宋高亢之嗓，不覺別有一番風味，迺咸趨之若鶩焉。頃悉天蟾父聘一老生南下，其人爲何，即劉派中之巨擘陳鴻聲是也。陳爲劉鴻聲之再傳弟子，其嗓較宋，尤有過之，而抑揚奔放，具譚余之型，而不失黃鐘大呂之致，作派允近馬，所能之劇，胥爲全部劉之三斬一碰，與宋又截然不同，刻已率其妹陳桂蘭南下，四日已抵塘沽，今夜（六日）即將抵滬，登臺之期，恐不川十日之間也。</p>
<h3>我愛「邊城古事」</h3>
<p>— 沙飛</p>
<p>看了「邊城故事」以後，一直徘徊在我腦海裏的，是一些浮動的羣衆的陰影。全劇分五幕，故事是叙述在西南邊地的一個偏僻的縣城中，那兒蘊藏很富的金礦，當地人民大半是用土法淘金，維持生活，政府想用機器大量開採，經過了許多的困難，才達到目的，這中間，自然有小丑們的鑽營破壞，然而正義的感化，終於使羣衆們都擔起責任，走向廣漠的原野了。</p>
<p>第一幕，是崇山峻嶺，川塲演員，達十餘人之多，拿着斧頭的二牛娃（白沉飾）他站在山頂上，東張西望。飾萬志大的是田振東，他的化裝，使觀衆最是迷戀，臉有威，眼有神，胸前長着黑茸茸的毛，那副傻頭傻腦的樣子，演得深刻之至。壞蛋殷小山（韓非飾），忽然從後臺搖着蒲扇踱川來，他的門牙突出着，說話時怪陰險，也有趣，允其是臨走的一跳，像是活猴般。這一幕的結束，是楊專員（廠俊飾）帶着老苟（史原飾）到山頭來，中了礦工的埋伏，和萬志大大打出手，結果萬志大吃了一點虧，於是種下了寃仇。</p>
<p>第二幕，是臥室布景，殷小山介紹萬志大的女兒鳳娃（英子飾）來做內綫，這一塲，全是聯環的笑彈，史原的山東國語，說得輕鬆風趣，英子的作弄楊專員，處處顯川番邦女子的可愛來。</p>
<p>第三幕，是森林，老苟給鳳娃等書照，後來張技士（深草飾）來了，王一淸（張伐飾）也來了，導演的趕走史原與英見聰明。——「轟」的一聲，礦山炸了，楊專員拼着命去救護他們，這一塲面，嚴俊熱情橫溢，自然活潑，確是難能可貴第五幕，在一個荒塲，大鬥外齊集着羣衆，殷小山立在高樹匕，自拉自唱，韓非的一舉一動，都實情實地，刻劃個奸細的輪廓，令人悠然神往。羣衆受了殷小山的騙，準備跟他走了。然而二牛娃拿着巴老爺被人暗算的兇刀衝來，結果王一淸被綁。殷小山得意洋洋的走到門口，楊專員和萬志大從省裏趕回來了，嚴俊揭破奸細的面目，這才使羣衆明白過來，於是殷小山開槍示威，鳳娃以身遮庄楊專員，受了重傷，萬志大追出去，也受了重傷，但殷小山是逃不出死的圈子的。鳳娃在瞑目時，她從胸前拿出老苟給他書的一張照片交給楊專員，這意思是說：「你不能忘記世間有這樣一個不平凡的女子呵。</p>
<p>我很愛「邊城故事」，我願為孤島靑年男女，推薦這一齣戲。</p>
<h3>旅港名票義演記</h3>
<p>— 籌成</p>
<p>滬上名票旅港日多，計有王曉籟，王元龍，徐琴芳，錢莉英等十餘人，男女俱全，凈旦生丑皆備。近由沈秋雁君發起聯合華南影星薛覺先　雪卿伉儷，及楊依華程劍霞等諸名票，義演平劇兩天，所有券資收入，悉獻於國家，以作救傷濟難之用。先組籌備會，推王曉籟主席，吳江楓郭筠峯編排劇目，沈君工小生，其夫人擅靑衣，研究程派，絕爲神似，夫唱婦隨，人皆艷羨。第一天夜戲開塲，請梅蘭芳揭慕，生色不少。計演林大濟之別窰，在化眞之薛禮救駕，章華金重濤之空城計，葉順生錢莉英之打漁殺家，陳牖生章英明之珠簾寨，李雲初之宇宙鋒，薛覺先之追韓信，徐琴芳唐雪卿之四郎探母，而以邵大椿（飾蘇三）沈秋雁（飾禁卒）之蘇三起解，最爲人注意。配以曹志功之崇公道，更發噱。次日日塲，張益齋葛福田演斬黃袍，工力悉敵，吳江楓鍾啟英陸智卿之黃鶴樓，亦頗賣力，孫頑璞陳湘潭雙演擊鼓罵曹，激昂康慨，令人興奮。大軸薛覺生（飾張嘉祥）王元龍（飾向大人）之三本鐵公鷄，南北兩影界鉅子，大別其苗頭，彩聲雷動。夜塲沈北屏金重濤之黃金台，吳和生鍾根之第義得寳，王元龍鐘啟英之冀州城，均無瑕可擊。而以李聲叔徐琴芳之捉放曹，風頭最健。蓋李君久居北平，與侯喜瑞，劉硯亭，蔣少奎，劉連榮等均友好，故能戲甚多。徐女十得某名伶悉心傳援，所有老生戲，無不精通，有字正腔圓，身段乾凈之譽。二難兼幷，相得益彰，大軸薛覺先（飾關公）之古城會，唱做俱重，盡善盡美，故僑胞閱後，皆大歡喜。</p>
<p>二七蕭長華</p>
<p>蕭長華，小名二順，丑角也。近年丑角人材凋零，長華積資與望，遂於此中　然視若魯殿靈光。長華之戲，詼諧嬉笑，不及已故之張文斌，而寬博則過之。任富連成科班教師綦久，今日富連成出科弟子，大率其門牆桃李，蓋長華雖以丑角應行，而在科班中，生旦亦多經其教授也。長華方巾丑頗有名，刺湯之湯勤，盜書之蔣幹，尤著時稱，然聆其此劇，無書生氣，殊少蘊藉之致，特較王長林之鄙俗粗野為差勝耳。地乏硃砂，赤土爲貴，談丑角者猶不得不首舉蕭二順，亦備微今昔盈虛消長之故矣！</p>
<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第十四章　圓圓小字嬌羅綺</p>
<p>這時正是暮春三月的天氣，江南草長，雜花生樹，溫和的艷腸照在原野，野田裹綠的紅的，黃的紫的，如錦如霞，好似舖着彩色的地毯。天空的流鶯，載飛載嗚睆悅耳，歌唱出大地之春。在那姑蘇城外橫塘一片淸水，岸芷十里幽香，河面上有一隻書舫，在靑山綠水中款乃地行着，正駛向隱巖去。舟中前艙裏正有一個十七八歲的吳宮嬌娃，風盤霧鬢，綺裳翠袂，體態甚是輕盈艷麗，從蓬窓中露出伊的俏面龐來，眺望着對面的獅子山。鵝蛋的臉兒，不肥不瘦，豐潤明潔，淡淡的蛾眉，溶溶的秋水，瓊瑤一般的鼻子，桃花似的兩頰，襯着一張圓而小的樓　，眞是增一分太長，减一分太短，好似老天故意憑着他化工的靈技，將山川靈秀鐘毓之氣製造出這一位千嬌百媚的好女兒來，在此兵荒馬亂的時代裹，演出一些銷魂蝕骨，恨綺愁羅的事跡，爲一頁國家興亡史上加以點綴，所謂「全家白骨成灰土，一代紅妝照汗靑」了。而在伊的身旁，和伊並肩而立的，尚有一位二十左右的美少年，指點着速山近水，且笑且語。這一對人間眷屬，無異天上神仙，到底是什麼人呢？原來這時候北地胭脂，雖然俊俏，却終不及江南金粉來得嫵嵋。時世雖儘是擾攘不寗，而梨園樂藉依然是弦管嗷嘈，粉飾太平。允其在秦淮河邊，姑蘇台畔，燈火樓台，船舫簫鼓，窮極繁華之致。（一三四）</p>

<h3>America Decides to Devote All Its Strength to Crush Axis Powers' Conquest Strategy; Hull Resumes Duties After Sick Leave and Issues Strong Declaration; America Guarantees to Provide Material Assistance to Soviet Union as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th. Secretary of State Hull, who had been ill for two months, has now resumed his duties at the State Department. International News Service, Washington, 5th. Secretary of State Hull gave his first speech yesterday after resuming his duties, stating that the free people of the world "hold the same goal, exert the greatest strength, and have the determination to win." Hull guaranteed that the United States would do its utmost to help others crush the Axis military forces.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 5th. Secretary of State Hull yesterday called on the entire United States to continuously strive and fight against the "military conquest operations spreading across the world," and predicted that "the victims of barbarism" would surely regain their status. At his first reception for journalists in two months, Hull strongly urged the American countries and other independent nations to "unite as one." Hull stated that "those who call themselves conquerors" can only be defeated by this unity. Hull's resolute remarks were made in response to the general demand for him to announce the international situation. Hull stated, "In the weeks of my absence, what we have firmly believed for several years would happen has now occurred with clear evidence. Reasonable people will understand this without argument, namely, that a military conquest operation has occurred worldwide, with methods to rule over the conquered peoples, most of whom are eliminated through barbarism and cruel means." Hull continued, stating that the current situation requires a continuous increase in national defense, ensuring its maximum efficiency everywhere and at all times.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th. Undersecretary of State Welles stated yesterday that the United States has formally agreed to provide the Soviet Union with as much assistance as possible. This promise of assistance was expressed in an exchange of notes, which extended the existing trade agreement between the two countries for another year. The notes were signed and exchanged on Saturday by Welles and the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Umansky. The United States has agreed to prioritize assistance to the Soviet Union with essential military supplies and to give the most friendly consideration to Soviet orders. It also plans to expand shipping facilities to transport aid and has agreed to abolish all export restrictions to the Soviet Union, guaranteeing that the Soviet Union can obtain various general permits to transport unlimited quantities of essential goods. The significance of this exchange of notes between the United States and the Soviet Union is that the Soviet Union will receive assistance from the United States in the same way as China and the United Kingdom, but without enjoying the benefits of the Lend-Lease Act. The Soviet Union can purchase American military supplies by paying cash or gold. In return, the Soviet Union guarantees to resist Germany to reciprocate the economic assistance received. Welles stated that the determination of the United States is to provide the Soviet Union with all possible economic assistance to strengthen its ability to resist aggression. The United States made this rapid decision because it believes that strengthening the Soviet Union's ability to resist such aggression, which not only endangers the security and independence of the Soviet Union but also threatens the security and independence of other countries, is of utmost importance to the national defense of the United States. Welles also pointed out that the requests from the Soviet Union and the orders placed with the United States, as well as the prompt delivery, will be given the most friendly consideration. Welles further stated that the United States will give priority to Soviet orders when implementing all applicable principles for orders from anti-aggression nations.</p>
<h3>Soviet Naval Commander-in-Chief Transferred to Vladivostok; Rumor Has It That President Roosevelt Will Meet With the British Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 5th. According to news from Moscow yesterday, Soviet Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Kuznetsov has been ordered to transfer to Vladivostok. The vacant position will be filled by Vice Admiral Orlov, who has been promoted to Admiral.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, 5th. According to British and American sources here, British Prime Minister Churchill will soon meet with US President Roosevelt. The meeting place will not be announced, but it will be somewhere in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Singapore Prepares to Cope With Emergencies; British Side Denies Stationing Troops on Thai Border</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 5th. Singapore is prepared to cope with any emergency. All aspects of passive defense are undergoing extensive training. Large-scale exercises are conducted throughout the island day and night. Air defense teams, auxiliary fire brigades, and medical rescue teams are also participating.</p>
<p>United Press, Singapore, 5th. A large number of Indian and British troops arrived here yesterday, including Royal Air Force personnel. Also arriving was the Prince of Patiala, who is here to inspect the Indian troops in Malaya. According to the newly arrived soldiers, no incidents occurred along the way.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 5th. Today's editorial in the "Free Press" solemnly warns the civilians of Singapore not to assume that the current crisis in the Far East can be peacefully resolved just because other recent crises in the Far East have been resolved. It also states that while there is no need to panic about the future, it would be dangerous to ignore the signs. Studying these signs can reassure us about the current situation, especially regarding the weakness of Japan's domestic front, which cannot withstand a war with Britain, the Dutch East Indies, or even the United States. However, apart from extreme fanatics, Japanese leaders may feel that attacking Malaya and the Dutch East Indies may not make Japan's situation worse than it is today. While the success or failure of this move is uncertain, it could provide a pretext for Japan to shirk responsibility for the unpleasant state of affairs that exists today. Therefore, the current policy of stability is based on the assumption that Japan is insatiable and will make our very solid defenses and economic preparations as perfect as possible, leaving nothing to regret.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th. Reuters has learned that the rumor that Britain has sent 100,000 troops to the Thai border is not true. The deployment of British troops in Singapore is purely defensive and there has been no large-scale troop movement as rumored.</p>
<p>United Press, Saigon, 5th. The French authorities acknowledged today that they knew of reports from the Japanese side that a British fleet had appeared in the Gulf of Siam. A representative of the Japanese acquisition delegation stated that this news was highly likely, but the rumor of the discovery of a British fleet spread rapidly here last night, but even semi-official confirmation could not be obtained.</p>
<p>Australia and New Zealand Appoint Defense Commanders, Determined to Defend Their Territory</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Melbourne, 4th. It has been officially announced that General Mackay, formerly commander of the Australian forces on the North African Libyan front, has been transferred to be the commander of the Australian Home Guard. According to well-informed sources, federal defense is becoming increasingly important and must be presided over by someone who has experienced modern warfare to be effective. General Mackay's assumption of this new post is truly a perfect match of person and position.</p>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 5th. Australian Army Minister Spender said yesterday that Australia is now watching the increasingly tense situation in the Far East with a calm and determined gaze. What we earnestly desire is to maintain peace in the Pacific, but we are not prepared to abandon the interests and territories of the British Empire under the threat of guns. We all bear the responsibility of defending these interests and territories and will not allow them to be destroyed by secret erosion. Vietnam, Malaya, and Thailand are close neighbors to Australia, just as they are to Japan. We are concerned to see Japanese troops arrive in Vietnam and there is no shortage of signs that Japan intends to go further. Japan's talk of protection is nothing more than a pretext for shameless aggression. If necessary, Australia will demonstrate its determination to decide its own destiny. The 90,000 Australian troops already deployed overseas will be greatly increased. More than 160,000 people have already enlisted in the Australian army, and there are 250,000 militiamen responsible for domestic defense.</p>
<p>Reuters, Melbourne, 5th. The Australian Army Minister announced on the radio last night that a total of 160,000 people have joined the Australian Imperial Forces, of whom 90,000 have been sent overseas. This is the first announcement of the number of Australian troops. Today, according to official sources, in proportion to the population, Australia's troop numbers seem to exceed even Canada's 576,000. Australia currently has 200,000 people for domestic defense, and a large number of personnel serve in the Australian Navy and Air Force.</p>
<p>Japan Forces Thailand to Embrace Them, Saying They Will Not Hesitate to Fight If Necessary</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told reporters today that the rumors that Japan is about to invade Thailand are untrue. This can be seen from the Vietnam joint defense treaty. Japan is only considering joint defense of Vietnam with France, and is only conducting economic negotiations with Thailand.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. This morning, several newspapers here carried editorials with the same tone, saying that Thailand must learn a lesson from the fate of Vietnam and trust Japan as its protector to remove the pressure from Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. "Kokumin Shimbun" published an editorial stating that the Dutch East Indies cannot escape Japan's co-prosperity sphere. However, Japan is now paying attention to Thailand first. Thailand is now under pressure from China, Britain, and the United States, and its security is threatened. Thailand announced on July 28 that it was prepared to resist aggression and did not recognize any country that had threatened or oppressed it. This statement was made under duress. The article cited Thailand's recent cooperation with Japan, but stated that Thailand's actions were not entirely clear, and hoped that it would take Vietnam as a model.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. Waseda University's Nakano published an article in "Yomiuri Shimbun" yesterday, stating that Japan has made a great determination. The Japanese people do not want war, but if necessary, they will not hesitate to shed blood like rivers and pile up corpses like mountains to defend themselves and protect the nation's honor. The landing of Japanese troops in Vietnam has strengthened the southern defenses, but the pressure from Britain and the United States in East Asia is no different from war. Japan should fight to the last person to break the blockade that Britain and the United States are currently imposing on Japan.</p>
<h3>All of Vietnam Occupied; Japanese Troops Gather in Saigon; Riverside Houses Requisitioned; Large Numbers of Aircraft Gather in Nha Trang</h3>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 5th. The Japanese military headquarters here stated that the Japanese army has now occupied all the bases in Vietnam granted to Japan by the Vichy government under the Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement, so the Japanese landing has now been completed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 5th. The landing of Japanese troops in Saigon is still in full swing. The general truth of the actions of the past six days is now gradually becoming clear. Japanese troops began landing in Nha Trang on July 28, and entered the Saigon area on the 30th. General Sumita and his entourage had already arrived here on the 26th in several trucks. The port of Saigon is filled with Japanese troop transports, freighters, and warships. Twenty-five troop transports have already arrived, unloading troops and war materials. There are still thirty ships outside Cape Saint Jacques. It is said that most of the occupying forces must land in Saigon. The war materials seem to be in order and the soldiers are mostly young, with no signs of battle experience. Houses are currently being occupied. Warehouses, chambers of commerce, large hotels, large commercial firms, and riverside houses and large private residences stretching half a mile in Saigon have been requisitioned, but British commercial premises have not been affected. The French shipping company's ship "Chaffee" is currently docked on the river, where the Europeans evicted from the Grande Hotel and other places can temporarily reside on board. On the surface, Saigon is still quiet, and the Japanese soldiers are not acting out of line. As for the French troops and war materials, they are moving north. All vehicles are now concentrated in the south, causing normal train services to be suspended. French aviation services have now been cancelled because the airport is occupied by Japanese fighters and trucks, leaving French aircraft with nowhere to take off or land. Most of the Japanese aircraft are temporarily gathered in Nha Trang, estimated at 250 aircraft, or said to be two squadrons of fighters and one squadron of bombers. Japanese truck transport teams are now heading to Cambodia one after another. Two teams of anti-aircraft guns and field guns have been seen heading north.</p>
<h3>Two American Warships Arrive in Australia; This Trip Is a Training Cruise</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 5th. The U.S. Navy Department announced that the heavy cruisers "Northampton" and "Salt Lake City" have arrived in Brisbane, Australia. It is said that this trip is a training cruise. The commander of the two ships is Rear Admiral Tinfett. This decision to enter Brisbane is to refuel and give the crew a few days of rest.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Issues Order Requisitioning Horses; Preliminary Step in Mobilization Plan</h3>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 5th. The Dutch East Indies has issued an order to requisition horses. This is a preliminary step in the mobilization plan. However, military authorities say that this move is just a test to ensure the smooth implementation of future mobilization laws.</p>
<h3>United States Prepares to Send Ship to Japan to Evacuate All Nationals</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th. The Maritime Commission said yesterday that the emergency fleet under its jurisdiction could carry all the stranded American nationals in Japan back to their home country when the State Department deems it feasible. Since Japanese ships cancelled voyages to the United States, many American nationals have been stranded in Japan. At the same time, Secretary of State Hull said that he was studying this issue, but he pointed out at a reception for reporters that he had previously advised American nationals to leave the Far East as early as possible while transportation was still available.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spokesman Discusses Soviet-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. An Information Bureau spokesman told reporters today that negotiations with the Soviet Union regarding the Fisheries Bureau boundary issue and various other negotiations are still in progress. As for commercial matters, they must be submitted to the Privy Council for approval. Asked about commercial talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, the spokesman replied that Japan did not want to interfere in the United States' policy towards the Soviet Union. Someone asked whether Japan would take the same attitude towards the United States' policy towards Europe. The spokesman replied in the affirmative, but with reservations, namely, that the United States' activities are limited to Europe and do not extend to the Far East. If it involves us, we will consider it.</p>
<h3>Japan and Dutch East Indies Adjust Trade; Understanding Said to Have Been Reached</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. A "Yomiuri Shimbun" reporter in Batavia reported that, according to some sources, Japan and the Dutch East Indies have apparently reached an understanding on adjusting trade relations and may transport goods through ports of both countries on a mutual assistance basis according to temporary measures.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. Information Bureau spokesman Ishii told reporters today that when asked about the Batavia news carried by "Yomiuri Shimbun" that Japan and the Dutch East Indies have apparently reached an understanding, Ishii replied that Japan and the Dutch East Indies do not want to stop trade with each other and are willing to continue operating in accordance with the agreement. This method must be discussed. Although the Dutch East Indies has frozen the assets of the Japanese following the footsteps of Britain and the United States, according to observers unrelated to both parties, the Dutch East Indies has demanded independent action. Although the volume of trade cannot be expected to remain the same as in the past, the Japanese Consul General in Batavia is currently discussing trade issues with the Dutch East Indies authorities, including the oil issue.</p>
<p>United Press, Batavia, 5th. It has been learned today that Japanese ships loaded goods in the Dutch East Indies today that had been paid for before the freezing order, including oil, but in very small quantities. It is said that special notices have not yet been issued, but the Ministry of Economic Affairs is expected to take measures soon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Tatsuta Maru Leaves America to Return Home; All Cargo Seized</h3>
<p>United Press, San Francisco, 5th. The repeatedly delayed Japanese mail ship "Tatsuta Maru" left here yesterday with 350 passengers, mostly Japanese nationals, but no cargo. The ship was loaded with 1,577 barrels of machine oil, for which the Washington Export Control Committee issued export licenses.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th. Information Bureau spokesman Ishii stated today that if it is deemed beneficial from a commercial point of view, Japan may resume shipping to the United States. The Japan Mail Ship Company's "Tatsuta Maru" has been released, but the cargo it carried has been seized by the US authorities. Now, other ships will wait for the outcome of this case to determine their actions. Asked about future commercial relations between Japan and the United States, the spokesman replied that we are not optimistic. Although freezing assets does not completely stop trade, if the situation worsens, there will be no trade to speak of. Asked whether Japan would take retaliatory action against the United States regarding the "Tatsuta Maru" case, the spokesman replied that we will consider this point if necessary.</p>
<h3>United States Actively Proceeding with Ship Building Program; Thirty-Four Ships Completed Last Month</h3>

The ships laid down included one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, ten destroyers, one submarine, and nine minesweepers.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>From Conquest to Breakthrough</h3>
<p>The German-Soviet war has been going on for six weeks. The boast made by Germany beforehand that it would resolve all Soviet military organizations in six weeks has now become a shattered illusion. Moreover, judging from the situation, not only is it impossible for Germany to defeat the Soviet Union fundamentally, but even if it wants to turn to another path, break out of a bloody road, or retreat to a defensive position, and maintain some of the war results that the Nazis have gained in Europe in the past two years, it has become a big problem.</p>
<p>Hitler's ambition to control the world is unprecedented, and his blind faith in the omnipotence of force is also unprecedented. Because of this, he invented the so-called "blitzkrieg," appearing everywhere with a do-or-die attitude. If he cannot win thoroughly, he will only suffer a complete defeat from the root. In the past two years, the German army has created many brilliant achievements in Europe, each of which is a concrete explanation of a thorough victory and a rapid victory. However, in this German-Soviet war, the situation it has encountered is not only different from the several major wars in Poland, Northern Europe, and the Balkans, but is also completely different from the major war against Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in Western Europe. In the past, it almost always won in one battle, and it had never heard of so-called "first offensives" and "second offensives." However, in this war against the Soviet Union, even the first large-scale offensive was completely thwarted, and it is said that a third massive offensive is currently being prepared. What is noteworthy now is that its attacking power is obviously weakening with each offensive. And what is questionable is, how many more major offensives can its resources and total strength still allow it to launch? Once Germany realizes and admits that the offensive is futile, and once its resources and total strength do not allow it to continue the offensive, inevitably, it will only retreat and take a defensive position, or turn to another path, and concentrate its efforts to attack one or two military and economic key points, trying to break through the encirclement.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the news circulating in the past two days that the German attack has focused on the southern route to Ukraine is not too early, then the German authorities may have reached the point of admitting that resolving the entire Soviet army is impossible, and are trying to break out, which is not impossible. Moreover, the so-called third full-line offensive that is said to be in preparation may not appear immediately. This will form a large-scale breakthrough battle that has never occurred in history.</p>
<p>The significance of Germany and Italy choosing Ukraine as the path to break through, economically, is of course to seize all the abundant resources such as local agricultural products and oil, and to further plot the Middle East and India. Strategically, it is to break out of a bloody road, hoping to pass through the relatively weak corner of the British, American, and Soviet fronts, and reach the goal of joining hands with their Eastern ally Japan through the Middle East and India, cutting off the land connection between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, thereby encircling the Soviet Union. The overall goal, of course, is to try to break through the layers of economic and military blockade and encirclement laid down by the three countries of Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, hoping to save their inevitable fate of defeat. Correspondingly with Germany and Italy attacking Ukraine, Japan also launched an offensive against Southeast Asia in the East, and after occupying all of Vietnam, it is actively pressing on Thailand. Although the distance between the eastern and western invaders is still very far, now that they realize that it is hopeless to defeat and conquer the anti-aggression front of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union individually, it is inevitable that they will jointly carry out a final breakthrough. And the relatively empty zone from Vietnam all the way to the Middle East is of course where the coveted goals of the invaders lie.</p>
<p>Until now, although the British, American, and Soviet responses to the eastern and western aggressive forces inevitably have different degrees of importance, the encirclement and blockade circle against Germany and Italy, economically, has reached a point of complete tightening and is very tight. Militarily, it has also reached the point of not hesitating to use all its strength and advancing towards the goal of thoroughly defeating Germany and Italy. As for Japan, economically, it is now only limited to partial actions such as freezing funds and stopping cargo transportation. Militarily, all arrangements are still focused on defense, and temporarily there may not be an active offensive. However, in terms of nature, military and economic aspects are equally important, and justice and aggression absolutely cannot coexist. In both the East and the West, there is no difference at all. Even if the Pacific War does not break out, once the Western invaders are defeated and the just forces jointly build the world, the fate of the Eastern invaders will be self-evident. Faced with these two encirclement circles, if the invaders want to save their common demise, of course, they can only attack Ukraine and threaten Turkey separately, as well as invade Vietnam and oppress Thailand.</p>
<p>However, the possibility of the invaders' breakthrough and the success of their attempt to actually merge is very small. As for the West, how will Germany and Italy succeed or fail in attacking Ukraine and threatening Turkey? Even if they concentrate their forces to attack this corner, the Soviet Union can of course take the opportunity to launch a major counter-offensive all the way from Minsk. Britain and the Soviet Union can cooperate in attacking the Baltic Sea and the Nordic countries. Britain can begin a counter-offensive on the European continent, or even Britain and the Soviet Union can jointly attack the Balkans and cut off the road from Germany and Italy to Ukraine. All these can turn Germany and Italy's dreams of entering the Middle East into dust. As for the weakness of the military power of the Eastern invaders and the depth of their economic dependence on foreign countries, it determines that any adventurous attempts of theirs are bound to fail.</p>
<p>In short, the external conquest and expansion of the aggressive forces has completely become a thing of the past. In the future, there will only be breakthroughs or retreats, and the result will be failure. Now that the anti-aggression front has been formed, any selfish or destructive actions have now disappeared forever.</p>
<h3>England and America Continue to Pressure Japan, Strengthening Their Position in the Pacific, Forcing Japan to Fight to the Finish, Various Dangers Can Be Cleared Away, Victory in the War Against Japan is Closer</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The optimistic sentiment among Chinese regarding the early conclusion of the Sino-Japanese war has been growing in tandem with the increasing pressure exerted on Japan by England and America, and the continuous flow of supplies from the United States and the Soviet Union into China. It is generally acknowledged that the Soviet Union’s resistance against Germany has been crucial in strengthening England and America’s position in the Pacific. Since Germany’s military and political victories in France, the Balkans, and the Near East, England and America have had to focus their full efforts on dealing with the European situation, forcing London and Washington to adopt a policy of appeasement to avoid immediate conflicts in the Pacific. Many people frankly expressed concern in the early stages of the German invasion of the Soviet Union about the Soviet Union's ability to contain the German forces. The collapse of Soviet resistance would have strengthened Germany's position in Europe and Japan's position in the Pacific. England and America, in this situation, would concentrate their efforts on defending the British Isles, hoping the war would prolong. However, the success of Soviet resistance has changed the situation in the Pacific. Now that Germany is mired in the war, this is a golden opportunity for England and America to shift their focus to the Far East and eliminate all sources of danger in the Pacific in one fell swoop. Many signs indicate that England and America are now forcing Japan to fight to the finish in the Pacific, such as the freezing of Japanese assets, the abrogation of commercial agreements, the American oil embargo against Japan, the arrival of large numbers of British land and air forces in Malaya and Burma, and the strengthening of Philippine defenses by the United States. These are recent developments that demonstrate a new trend in England and America's Far Eastern policy. Chinese officials believe that whether Japan attacks the north or advances south, it will risk war with major powers. The final outcome may be determined within a year. At the same time, China's military position has been greatly strengthened by the continued arrival of supplies from the United States and the Soviet Union. Although government officials have so far refused to comment, according to reliable sources, not only are American planes transporting supplies to China, but also a large number of volunteer pilots are coming to China.

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Unified Tax Collection Agencies, Determined to Extend to All Cities and Counties, Each County and City Established a Tax Bureau to Collect All Kinds of Local Taxes</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Ministry of Finance has unified the tax collection agencies this year, and each province has achieved one bureau per province.

After the consolidation is completed, it will be handed over to the tax bureau. The same is true for other national taxes. When people pay taxes, they pay into the national treasury or the county and city treasury according to the nature of the tax.

<h3>Chen Jie Talks to Reporters, Staff of the Embassy in Berlin Have All Been Evacuated, More Than a Hundred Students Remain in Germany, German Cultural Institutions Promise Economic Assistance</h3>
<p>New York – Chen Jie, former ambassador to Germany, recently met with a reporter from the Central News Agency and said that the Chinese government's swift decision to sever diplomatic relations with Germany because Germany recognized the Nanjing organization greatly shocked German officials. In general, people from all walks of life in the German military, political, and financial circles expressed regret over the severance of relations between the two countries. The general public was even more surprised and deeply saddened by Germany's recognition of the Nanjing organization. Chinese people are still respected by Germans. Many families of high-ranking German officials, including those in the financial world, invited Chinese diplomats to farewell banquets, indicating that there are currently strong pro-China elements in the German government. Japan spent a lot of effort in asking Germany to recognize the Nanjing organization. Germany's recognition of the Nanjing organization was not out of special love for Japan or hatred for China. It was a temporary expedient because Japan's ambiguous attitude had caused anxiety in Germany. When asked about the internal situation in Germany, Chen said that Germans are confident that they will win, and as long as the German army wins, the people's will can be maintained. The military supplies and food that Germany takes from various occupied countries are not enough to meet Germany's needs, and it is now encountering a financial crisis. Chen also said that the staff of the Chinese Embassy in Berlin and the consulates in Hamburg, Vienna, and other places have now all been evacuated. At present, there are still 1,150 overseas Chinese living in Germany, including 150 students. German cultural institutions have promised to provide economic assistance to this group of students. When the staff of the Chinese Consulate in Vienna were evacuated via Lisbon, Striese, a member of the former German military advisory group to China, helped a lot with transportation.

<h3>The Vichy Government Assures the United States that It Will No Longer Cede Territory</h3>
<p>Vichy, United Press, May 5 – The Vichy government yesterday assured the United States that it would refuse to cede French military bases to Germany or other powers. Vichy also said that Dakar "is in a state of full defense." Newspapers in Paris under German control warned Vichy that unless Vichy agrees to "political and economic cooperation to defend French colonial territories, as in the Far East," Vichy will face "tragic consequences." The Paris newspaper said that there should be "rapid changes in personnel and methods" in the Pétain government. "Paris Works" reported that when U.S. Ambassador Leahy spoke with Pétain and Darlan last Friday, he "suggested that the United States help France resist Germany and defend the African empire."</p>

<p>Tokyo, Reuters, May 5 – In order to increase domestic oil production to cope with the reduction in overseas supplies, the Fuel Control Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has decided to merge ten small and medium-sized oil companies into several large companies. According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 90% of Japan's total oil refining output is now controlled by the semi-official Japan Oil Company and other large companies. It is now believed that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will extend the coupon system currently applied to gasoline to light oil, heavy oil, kerosene, and petroleum.</p>

<p>Chongqing – According to Reuters, Cooper, the former British Minister of Information and current British Cabinet Representative to the Far East, is currently in India and will soon come to Chongqing. Although the Japanese have repeatedly reported that Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in the Far East, has arrived in Chongqing, Brooke-Popham has not actually come here. However, there was indeed a plan to visit the wartime capital of China, but the trip was canceled due to important matters elsewhere. (Fifth dispatch, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Germany Replenishes Military Supplies, Prepares to Launch New Offensive; Soviet Resistance Strengthens, Progress Difficult; Finnish Troops Also Fail in the Ladoga Sector</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th. A dispatch from the Swedish capital states that German sources continue to report that German forces are destroying the resistance of surrounded Soviet troops on the two major fronts of Smolensk and Kiev, and are continuing to advance eastward at different speeds. The purpose of the German message is clearly to give the impression that the German army is now holding its acquired positions, or is advancing, and has not been forced to retreat. The German side also stated that the surrounded Soviet troops must be dealt with, and that the slow advance of the German army allows the lagging infantry to catch up. A military correspondent for a newspaper in the Swedish capital stated that the German side has now completed its arrangements in the rear areas, allowing the exhausted troops to rest slightly, reorganize the damaged units, repair mechanized combat equipment, and mobilize fresh troops, preparing to resume the offensive. However, this pause will also benefit the Soviet army. According to a dispatch from the newspaper's Berlin correspondent, the German side said that the quality of the Soviet reinforcements is inferior to that of the Soviet troops who fought in the initial battles. Military experts predict that the German army will soon launch a large-scale new attack, aiming for Leningrad, Moscow, Kiev, and Odessa. Currently, Finnish troops are still trying to break through the area between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega. If successful, they could cut off the Soviet Union's transportation route to Murmansk. If Finnish troops make progress in this area, they can put pressure on Leningrad from the east. However, the Soviet army has not carried out any destructive actions in Sortavala, which proves their determination to hold the city and prevent the Finns. Only artillery activity continues on the island of Hango. It is reported that Soviet troops are constantly arriving on the island of Hango, indicating that the Finnish attempt to starve the Soviet garrison has failed. According to a report from Sulik, the German Frankfurter Zeitung reported that Moscow has begun evacuating men, women, and children who are unsuitable for work, and is strictly prohibiting refugees from using railways and main roads, using the experience gained in the French war, in order to avoid hindering military operations. Also, the Soviet newspaper Pravda stated that the German army attacking the Soviet Union is two to three times larger than the Red Army stationed on the border. It is estimated that the German side has mobilized 30 divisions (approximately 500,000 people), 10,000 first-line aircraft, and 15,000 tanks. However, facing fierce Soviet resistance, the talk of the German army achieving amazing victories on the front line is now unheard of. Instead, the excuse is only that annihilating the Soviet army is more important than occupying land. The newspaper continued that the German side failed to destroy the Soviet air force first, and the German mechanized forces failed to achieve their goals. This was the German side's biggest miscalculation. The German army has suffered heavy losses, and morale has inevitably declined. The German advance eastward has not only failed to advance directly but has instead encountered death and destruction. Although the final outcome cannot yet be determined, fierce fighting is still ongoing. However, the Soviet army's resistance and counter-offensive power are indeed becoming stronger day by day. According to Finnish news received in Vyborg, fierce fighting continues around Sortavala at the northern end of Lake Ladoga. The Soviet troops in the area continue to contain the Finnish army's resolute attacks, and Soviet tanks are constantly counter-attacking. The city of Sortavala is a strong stronghold on the flanks of the Finnish army attacking along both sides of Lake Ladoga. The Soviet garrison in the area has received reinforcements. The network of fortresses built by the Soviet Union in the area ceded by Finland last year is centered on Sortavala. The excellent artillery of the defenders and the dangerous terrain are also of great help. Moscow Radio stated that large numbers of wounded German soldiers are currently being sent to the occupied areas for treatment. There are 18 to 20 trains a day carrying wounded soldiers arriving in Germany.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 5th. The pressure of the German offensive towards central Ukraine along Korosten, Belaya Tserkov, and in various directions north and south of Kiev, continued for the third day of major fighting yesterday. Marshal Timoshenko, who commands the entire western front of the Red Army south of Estonia, is putting up a strong resistance with his troops. At the same time, in the fighting around Smolensk for the past 18 days, the Soviet army has launched repeated counter-attacks, attempting to destroy the German army's salient positions. Fierce fighting continues and has yet to stop. Only minor skirmishes have occurred on the Finnish and Bessarabian fronts.</p>
<h3>Soviet Garrison in the Karelian Isthmus Prepares to Launch Offensive Against Finnish Troops</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 5th. News arriving here today states that Soviet troops, under the command of General Stern, former commander of the Far Eastern Army, are preparing to attack the Karelian Isthmus between Keksholm and Raasuli on the southern shore of Lake Ladoga. The news also stated that according to air force reconnaissance reports, multiple trains carrying military supplies are traveling between Leningrad and Finland, and large Soviet forces are concentrated behind the old Murmansk front line. It is reported that Finnish troops have moved to the front line and are proceeding towards the defenses of the isthmus to deal with a possible Soviet attack. According to news arriving here, at the beginning of the war, it was generally estimated that the Soviet army had gathered a million troops on the northern front, while the Finnish army had 300,000 and the German army had 100,000. It is reported that half of the Soviet troops in this area will face the threat of 200,000 Finnish troops in the Karelian Isthmus. The news further stated that General Stern's offensive will determine the outcome of the battle for Leningrad. The news also stated that the Soviet army is prepared to attack the northern shore of Lake Ladoga, indicating a desire to defend the Murmansk Railway and the Stalin Canal.</p>
<h3>British Military Observers Believe Actual War Has Just Begun</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 5th. Some well-informed British army observers believe today that the real Soviet war is now beginning, and that the operations of the past six weeks were only the opening of a large-scale war. At the same time, according to information from this source, the Soviet Union may have transferred its second-line troops to the areas of the Polish Corridor and Bessarabia, and deployed its well-trained and equipped Red Army to defend its initial defenses along the old border. This superior army is currently fighting the German army in Smolensk, Leningrad, and other places. However, as both sides are currently deploying fresh troops, there may be even more fierce fighting in the next six or eight weeks. No one can know the outcome of this battle, as no one knows how the heavy losses on both sides can be replenished, and no one knows what kind of stockpiles both sides will use in this war.</p>
<h3>Mussolini Makes Grandiose Claims, Says Victory in Anti-Soviet War is Inevitable</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 5th. The Italian official news agency stated that Mussolini gave a speech yesterday in the Mantua area to a regiment of Italian Blackshirts sent to assist on the Eastern Front. The struggle between Fascism and Bolshevism has finally arrived. You are honored to participate in this great battle. The people of the world have been approaching this severe test for twenty years. Will the victor be Fascism or Bolshevism? This will be decided here. The struggle for which we have prepared for many years has now entered its final stage, and this great drama has now reached its fifth act. The division between the two sides is now complete. On one side are Weimar, Berlin, and Tokyo, and on the other side are London, Washington, and Moscow. We will surely win, because history shows that all people who represent past ideas will fail, while those who represent future ideas will win. Those who will fight alongside you on the Soviet front are not only German comrades, but also Finns, Romanians, Slovaks, and volunteers from other countries. I believe that you will fight with determination and courage. Remember this saying: anyone who hesitates in war will fail.</p>
<h3>German Planes Raid Suez Area; Malta Also Attacked</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 5th. The German official news agency stated that on Sunday night, German planes attacked the Suez Canal area, and one 10,000-ton merchant ship and one 8,000-ton cargo ship were hit and sunk. In addition, at least one passenger ship of 20,000 tons was hit and severely damaged.</p>
<p>Reuters, Malta. The official report stated that Malta issued alarms twice on Sunday night. A small number of enemy planes flew in and dropped bombs. One plane was caught in a searchlight and hurriedly dropped its bombs, causing slight damage to civilian houses, but no damage to military buildings. There were also no casualties among the soldiers. Furthermore, enemy patrol fighters flew near Malta yesterday morning. Seeing British fighters taking off to intercept them, they immediately fled. A large church in a densely populated area was recently indiscriminately bombed by enemy planes and damaged by bombs.</p>
<h3>British Troops in Tobruk Attack Enemy Forces</h3>
<p>United Press, Cairo, 5th. Yesterday's general headquarters communique stated that the British vanguard troops in Tobruk were very active. The communique stated that the British vanguard in Tobruk continues to advance and attack. Although they have achieved some important victories and destroyed enemy minefields, the enemy forces have apparently refused to make contact and have retreated in the night.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 5th. A communique from the British Middle East Air Force Command stated that South African Air Force bombers fiercely attacked enemy positions in Tobruk on Sunday, with dozens of heavy bombs hitting enemy artillery positions. British Air Force and South African Air Force fighters carried out offensive patrols in the skies over enemy-occupied areas. On Saturday night, a large British Air Force heavy bomber force fiercely attacked the port of Benghazi, causing a large fire, and one bomb hit an enemy anti-aircraft gun crew. Anti-aircraft guns and searchlights at the Berka airfield were also strafed by low-flying British planes. On the same night, British naval aircraft bombed the enemy airfield at Gambut. On Sunday, British planes attacked several Italian fighters at the Italian airfield of Riccio. Where the bombs landed, fragments of Italian aircraft flew high into the sky. Many Italian aircraft were destroyed. All British planes returned safely.</p>
<h3>Indian Poet Tagore Seriously Ill</h3>
<p>Reuters, Calcutta, 5th. The condition of Sir Rabindranath Tagore, the famous Indian poet who has been ill for a long time, is quite worrying.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Chongqing, the Mountain City, by Mr. and Mrs. Luce, Authorities in the American Publishing World (Part Two)</h3>
<p>Two</p>
<p>I slept very comfortably in the Kong residence, and had coffee and milk for breakfast. At ten o'clock, Weddy White and I went to Foreign Minister Wang's residence for a purely introductory visit. We returned at half-past ten, and as the car was driving on the bustling street, Weddy suddenly said: "There's an air raid." I didn't feel anything, but he had noticed that people on the sidewalk were starting to run away. I immediately noticed that everyone was running very fast, and the shopkeepers were rushing to close their doors. We all went into the room, and everything was very quiet, but the servants were already packing our luggage in our room. We immediately rushed to the street as quickly as possible. At this time, the whole city was evacuating. The street in front of the Kong residence was crowded with people from the civilian areas. Everyone was carrying suitcases and belongings, and even more people were carrying babies and fleeing the alarm. The older children walked on the road more calmly. As we turned a corner, we saw a very orderly stream of people gradually pouring down the mountain. When we reached the main street, traffic was terribly congested. Car horns beeped intermittently. Trucks and crowded cars kicked up dust.</p>
<p>At this time, the first alarm had already sounded, meaning that Japanese planes had left Hankou an hour ago and were now flying into Sichuan. The planes might not go directly to Chongqing; we would have to wait for the second alarm in half an hour to be sure. The American embassy across the river was about to host a banquet for us. Dr. Kong specially sent a secretary to take care of us and asked us to hide in the air-raid shelter. But Weddy knew there was still plenty of time, so we took a detour to the riverbank dock.</p>
<p>A steamboat that didn't look very big agreed to take us across the Yangtze River, but after reaching the other side, the steamboat didn't take us to the embassy, which was another mile downstream. The steamboat went straight to the shore and left us on the wide sandy riverbank. A very polite guard asked us to run a little further away from the sandy shore. Another guard told us to go even further. Weddy then said, "Ah," and the guard said to us with joy, "The Chairman is coming soon."</p>
<p>Sure enough, two steamboats approached the dock—the first one was larger, and twenty people in plain blue-gray clothes jumped off the boat and stood on both sides of the path. A dazzling car was waiting there. Then, from the small steamboat that had just taken us across the river, came a slender figure, wearing a felt hat and a black semi-uniform outfit. He walked with a light, orderly pace, tapping his black cane with each step. As he walked, he slightly raised his hat. We saw him nod his head, and he immediately got into the car. A minute later, we were riding the steamboat of Asia's greatest leader since Kangxi 250 years ago, heading downstream.</p>
<p>As we traveled in the river between the towering mountains, we could see many people on the Chongqing side going to the caves to take shelter. At the embassy dock, Major McHugh met us, and he was surprised by the steamboat we were riding and the direction we came from. We got into sedan chairs and immediately noticed an American gunboat docked in a rocky harbor. The size of the harbor was just enough to accommodate the gunboat. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks Entrusted to Manage Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>American Government Issues Notes to the Four Banks Limited to Unfrozen Portion of Exchange</p>
<p>Since the US and UK successively issued orders to freeze Chinese and Japanese funds, American and British banks in Shanghai have been instructed to implement the freeze. In order to maintain legitimate trade, special notes have been granted to fourteen banks, including Citibank and HSBC, to sell foreign exchange to meet the needs of importers and exporters. A reporter from the New Voice Press learned yesterday from the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks that the US government has recently issued special notes to the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, allowing them to buy and sell foreign exchange on the same basis as the fourteen friendly banks. The British method has already been sent to the Shanghai branches of the four banks at 2 pm yesterday by the US Consul General in Shanghai, based on the consultation to the four banks' head offices. The provisions of this consultation are the same as the general notes No. 58 and No. 59 previously issued by the US government, but its scope is limited to the unfrozen portion of foreign exchange receipts. As for other Chinese merchant banks engaged in foreign exchange, they are also included. Chinese funds in the United States that have been specially approved by the Chinese government are not subject to this restriction. The detailed contents of the four banks' entrusted foreign exchange management measures by the US government will be officially announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Continued Supply for Legitimate Needs</p>
<p>The Russian New Life Newspaper reports that since Japanese funds were frozen, the UK and the US, at the request of the Chinese government, also froze Chinese funds. Chinese and foreign people in this city are still closely watching its development. Our reporter visited Mr. Kann, a famous economist and monetary expert here, to ask for his opinion on the future of Shanghai's finances. The reporter first asked what impact the freezing of Chinese funds would have on the Chinese economy. According to Mr. Kann's reply, due to the short time, it is still impossible to observe the results of the implementation of the freeze in the future. The reporter then asked what new measures the banks in this city would adopt to implement this order. According to the reply, the banks are strictly implementing the new regulations, but it seems that the supply to the legitimate needs of the business community in this city will not be suspended at this time. As of now, US dollars deposited in banks by private individuals can still be withdrawn, but the US dollars are paid at the market price converted into legal tender.</p>
<p>Living Expenses Are Also No Problem</p>
<p>As for how to handle the issue of "reciprocal" British pounds, some banks have asked London for instructions on how to prevent capital flight. Detailed instructions were received the day before yesterday (the 4th). According to these instructions: (1) those who can prove their use for legitimate import purposes; (2) those who have documents proving that they are being shipped to China, can apply to the bank for approval to supply foreign exchange, and there is no reason to refuse. In addition, if they rely solely on this foreign exchange deposit to maintain their livelihood, they can be satisfied to some extent. It is also not difficult to obtain foreign exchange for gold pounds to pay insurance premiums and remit them abroad for education expenses. This method is also applicable to US dollars.</p>
<p>The Status of Legal Tender is Increasingly Consolidated</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the reporter continued to ask about the impact of the freezing order. He said that this move is particularly beneficial to legal tender, because US dollar depositors in various banks are rushing to sell US dollars and easily obtain legal tender. However, due to the unstable international situation and the increase in "embargoed" items abroad, the import side of this city has fallen sharply. In conclusion, Mr. Kann mentioned the future of legal tender. It is said that the status of legal tender will remain as solid as ever, and there are various signs that it can be asserted that it will be further improved.</p>
<h3>Taikoo's Northern Shipping Line, S/S Shuntien, Requisitioned by Government Order</h3>
<p>Only S/S New Peking Remains on That Route; Fewer British Ships, American Ships Continue to Pass</p>
<p>Foreign shipping on the Yangtze River route has been suspended for more than four years due to the impact of the Sino-Japanese War. British ships on the northern and southern shipping lines still maintain normal operations, but British ships sailing to ports in North China are often harassed by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Quarantine Suspension</p>
<p>Recently, the S/S Shuntien, the regular ship on Taikoo's northern shipping line, was originally scheduled to load passengers and cargo in Shanghai at noon on Saturday (the 2nd) and sail to Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin. Before leaving, it suddenly received a notice from the Customs Quarantine Office that passengers traveling to North China must be examined by the ambassador. The ship then suspended its export and went through quarantine procedures, with the top fixed departure at noon on Monday (the 4th).</p>
<p>Requisitioned by Telegram</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the doctor's certificate was not issued at that time, so it was changed to leave port at 5 pm. At that time, the doctor's certificate was not issued again, so the company reported that it would be changed to start at 10 am yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, a telegram was suddenly received from Hong Kong yesterday morning ordering the requisition of the ship, and the ship was declared to have suspended its sailing to North China. More than 600 passengers were notified to register and refund their tickets. This time, the ship was loaded with tea, corn, native paper, piece goods, cotton yarn, etc., which will be taken out within a few days. Once the goods are unloaded, it will sail south to Singapore in response to the call.</p>
<p>Only One Ship Remains</p>
<p>The Taikoo company's northern shipping line originally had the S/S Shengking and the S/S Shuntien operating on the route. The S/S Shengking was requisitioned to Singapore in March of this year, and the S/S New Peking was transferred to replace the S/S Shengking to operate on the northern shipping line. Now the S/S Shuntien has been requisitioned again. Afterwards, the Taikoo company's northern shipping line only has one ship, the S/S New Peking, operating on the route. Whether the company will transfer another ship to take over has not yet been indicated. The S/S New Peking can return to Shanghai from North China today and is scheduled to sail to Tianjin on the 9th, also calling at Weihaiwei and Yantai.</p>
<p>Baohe Shipping</p>
<p>Also, due to the European war, the ships belonging to the British Baohe Shipping Company's Far East line only go as far as Hong Kong, and no longer come to this city. Mr. N.H. Lacey, the manager of the company, will also be leaving Shanghai soon to return to England to serve in the military. The day before yesterday (the 4th), he issued a notice to the relevant business firms, stating that the company's office will continue to operate as usual, but the duties of the manager will be entrusted to Mr. S.C. Smith, manager of the Poulson &amp; Davis firm at Beijing Road, to act as agent. The firm has accepted the invitation, so a joint notice was issued the day before yesterday regarding the above. British ships in the Far East are gradually decreasing, while American ships on the Pacific line are still maintained, and cargo ships continue to arrive in Shanghai. There is a mail ship from the United States arriving in Shanghai about every eleven days, and the next day it goes to Hong Kong and Luzon. Another ship, the President Coolidge, goes from San Francisco to Hong Kong, and then directly to Luzon. It is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Luzon via Hong Kong next Tuesday, and return to the United States the next day. Japan is not clear.</p>
<h3>Jurisdiction over Route Bay Sz Chung, etc. Transferred to Foch Police Station</h3>
<p>Effective August 3rd of this year, the segments of Route Bay Sz Chung, Route Mai Chi, and Road Geh Loh within the jurisdiction of the Betong Police Station of the French Concession are transferred to the jurisdiction of the Foch Police Station. Therefore, if residents in the above segments have any incidents in the future and need to contact the French Police Station, please contact the Foch Police Station at 307 Road Geh Loh (Telephone 70160).</p>
<h3>Japan Seeks to Seize Mineral Resources in Central China</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of domestic resources, the Japanese are attempting to seize various military raw materials in various parts of Central China to prolong their war machine. Recently, Tai Tian Quai, director of the Central China Liaison Office of the East Asia Institute, went to inspect the Lei Ye, Ma'anshan, and other mining areas for "development." He was accompanied by Bun Do Ching Hsiung, director of the Technology Department of the East Asia Institute. According to the Japanese Xinlu News, Bun Du has recently returned to Nanjing and made a statement. According to the investigation, "The iron ore at Daye, Ma'anshan, Tao Chong, and Phoenix Mountain is of extremely good quality, exceeding general expectations. Among them, the iron ore at Ma'anshan in particular, has an iron content of 60%, which is truly the world's unparalleled high-quality ore. If it can be electrically extracted, then the coal and iron in Central China can be self-sufficient. The East Asia Institute will implement technical improvements and step up mining based on the results of this inspection in order to achieve mass production."</p>
<h3>Mobil Oil Tanker Detained by Japanese</h3>
<p>Sailing to Shiyi Xu in Jiangbei, Detained by Japanese Warship and Escorted Back</p>
<p>British ships sailing along the Chinese coast are often discriminated against by the Japanese and subjected to inspections, detentions, and various kinds of harassment. Even American ships are afraid of the difficulties. Recently, the American Mobile Oil Company's small tanker, the Mayao, loaded oil in Shanghai on the 19th of last month and went to Shiyi Xu in Jiangbei, downstream of the Yangtze River, to unload. It arrived at its destination that day. There was fighting in the area, so it could not unload the goods and immediately returned to Shanghai. On the way, it encountered a Japanese warship, underwent inspection, and was escorted to the outer reaches of the Wusongkou for surveillance. It entered the port in the morning on Saturday (the 2nd) and docked at the Mobil dock, but was still under surveillance by Japanese soldiers. Suddenly, at 10:15 am the day before yesterday (the 4th), the Japanese used a small boat to tow it to buoy No. 16-16A. At 1 pm, it was towed to the Customs wharf on Nanchang Road. Then, at 5 pm that afternoon, it was towed back to buoy No. 16-16A. It is still berthed at that buoy today. Mobil has reported the detention of the Mayao to the American consulate in Shanghai and is currently negotiating. The company stated yesterday that the oil loaded on the ship is its own cargo and there is no suspicion. It is expected to be released in two or three days.</p>
<h3>French Concession Public Transportation Resumes Two Routes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Armed police escorts protect the vehicles; Further negotiations by the authorities are expected to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Following a labor strike by workers of the French Power and Water Company demanding subsidies, which began the day before yesterday, the company, in order to maintain transportation within the concession, resumed service yesterday on Routes 1 and 7 tram lines, with armed police escorts provided by the French police. The political department of the French police and other departments have taken measures to mediate further and have advised workers to resume work first, pending a reasonable solution. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forced Resumption of Service</p>
<p>After the work stoppage by workers in the Vehicle and Machine Departments, all tram and trolleybus lines and public buses within the French Concession were completely suspended. At the same time, the vehicles of the British tram company in the Public Concession temporarily suspended entering the French Concession. In order to maintain transportation within the concession, the company authority first resumed service yesterday on Route 1, from the Sixteen Pups to Route Ferguson, and Route 7, from the Sixteen Pups to Avenue Haig at Route Tenant de la Tour, with two armed police escorts assigned to each vehicle by the police. As for the remaining tram lines and trolleybuses, and public buses on Routes 21 and 22, the company also plans to selectively restore service on important routes.</p>
<p>Efforts to Mediate</p>
<p>The political department of the French police and other departments advised workers to resume work first, pending a reasonable solution. Yesterday, the authorities held talks with representatives of the workers to negotiate a solution. After reaching an agreement with the workers, they will then negotiate with the company's director. It is reported that the point of contention in this labor dispute is the issue of subsidies and is not particularly serious. The workers believe that if the company agrees to increase subsidies, they will resume work. Since the company has accepted the principle of increasing subsidies, this work stoppage is not expected to escalate and can be resolved.</p>
<p>A Genuine Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Recently, newspapers reported that the Shanghai French Tram Company had increased the salaries of its Chinese employees by 15% in July, while the salaries of its French employees had increased by 50%. This difference in treatment seems to be the main reason for the workers' dissatisfaction, leading to this strike. In fact, this is due to a misunderstanding. For the benefit of the public, it seems necessary to clarify the truth, as this will be beneficial to the efforts to resume work. The resumption of work should be supported by all three parties involved: the public, the workers, and the company.</p>
<p>Salary Increase Percentage</p>
<p>The salary increases for French and Chinese employees in July were based on different items. In terms of temporary proportional subsidies, it could be said that one side was increased by 50% of the base salary, while the other side was increased by 15% of the base salary. However, it should be noted that when comparing the total amounts added to the salaries of Chinese and French employees, the total amount of salary increases for both sides was actually 10%.</p>
<p>Sympathetic Consideration</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the workers decided to strike, the company authority had already declared to the labor union that it was willing to give sympathetic consideration to another salary increase for Chinese employees. The company authority has not changed its position on this point. As such, since this strike is detrimental to the prosperity of Shanghai, it should be resolved immediately.</p>
<p>Police Escorts</p>
<p>The French Power and Water Company includes tap water, electricity, trams, and public buses. Although all workers in the Vehicle and Machine Departments are on strike, causing trams and public buses to stop running, there is no fear of interruption in the supply of tap water and electricity generation because foreign workers are still working. The French power plant in Zikawei has been heavily guarded by a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives and French troops to protect it.

<h3>Bloody Incident Occurs in the HSBC Building This Morning. Japanese Insurance Company Tea Boy Forms a Gang to Commit Murder. Accountancy Intern One Killed and One Injured.</h3>
<p>This morning, a major bloody incident occurred suddenly in Room 144 of the HSBC Building at No. 12 The Bund. Room 144 of the building is the Kobe Shanghai Fire Insurance Co., Ltd., a Japanese company. It employed Mr. Qian Defeng, a Ningbo native, as an accountant. Mr. Qian lived in Nanshi, but recently, due to the closure of the iron gate in the French Concession, Mr. Qian temporarily lived in the company and shared a bed with Mr. Cao Wenfei (18 years old), a local intern. At 3:30 this morning, when Mr. Qian was still fast asleep, Mr. Ding Changrong (24 years old), a Yangzhou native who worked as a tea boy in the company, and his elder brother, Mr. Ding Changqing (26 years old), carried sharp knives and iron bars, sneaked into Mr. Qian and Mr. Cao's bedroom, and without asking any questions, stabbed wildly at the bed in the darkness. Mr. Qian and Mr. Cao could not avoid the attacks. Mr. Qian was stabbed seven times in the head and once in the abdomen, while Mr. Cao was stabbed twice in the chest and abdomen. Blood flowed all over the bed.</p>
<p>After Mr. Qian was seriously wounded, he still forcefully grabbed Mr. Ding Changrong and shouted for help. Although he managed to struggle free, neighbors in the building heard the screams from the room and, knowing that a tragedy had occurred, got up and went to investigate. They also turned on the lights and realized that there had been a murder. At that time, Mr. Qian and Mr. Cao were unconscious on the bed due to their serious injuries. The neighbors and the building watchman saw that the Ding brothers were stained with blood.</p>
<p>They were suspicious of their appearance. They went forward to inquire. At that time, Mr. Ding Changrong alone claimed that a thief had broken in to rob, but everyone had doubts and knew that the two must be the murderers. They reported the matter to the police station in charge, and detectives arrived to send Mr. Qian and Mr. Cao to the Renji Hospital for treatment and rescue. They also found bloody knives and iron bars in the room, as well as carefully observing that Mr. Ding Changrong and Mr. Ding Changqing were also slightly injured. The Ding brothers and Mr. Sun Sheng, a Jiangbei native who worked as a servant in the company, were taken to the</p>
<p>Police station for investigation. Regarding the bloody incident, it was heard that Mr. Ding had previously stolen items from the company and was reprimanded by Mr. Qian. Mr. Ding then conspired with his elder brother to commit murder. (Mr. Ding Changqing had recently come to Shanghai from Pukou and was staying at his brother's place.) In the dark, they could not recognize the target clearly, causing Mr. Cao to suffer an innocent disaster. It is said that the police station is currently investigating the case. Mr. Cao Wenfei died at 4:00 PM due to his serious injuries.</p>

New transactions were opened for the September British and US currencies. The freezing of foreign exchange, which was originally a big deal, allowed buying and selling on credit to continue in secret. The general price level, however, rose significantly because of it. Mobil Oil also had buy-ins. Although foreign banks had supplies for sale, they inevitably raised prices, resulting in the US dollar opening at $5.21875 in the morning. It soon became difficult to close, trending towards weakening. Chinese speculators and importers intensified their activities, tending towards buying, causing HSBC's small counter US dollar rate to shrink to $5.125. The US dollar was supplied at $5 for larger settlements. Therefore, there was talk that foreign banks would maintain the above price in the future. The price gradually tightened until the market closed, a significant squeeze compared to the previous day. Trading became more active.</p>
<p>Speculators are Unusually Active</p>
<p>Since the foreign telegrams indicated that silver had shrunk and that the US and UK were stable, the exchange rates of various countries remained unchanged. The central listing of various exchange rates remained stable. At the start of the domestic market, banks were selling spot British currency at a flat 3/8d per 1.09375 and the US dollar at $5.21875. Mobil Oil was reported to have come to settle for the August US dollar at $5.21875, and it immediately became difficult to close, trending towards weakening. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver balancing tax was still at 24.25%. HSBC's small counter US dollar rate remained at $5.1875. Chinese speculators were even more active, using the names of importing merchants to buy British gold at 3/8d per 1.09375 and the August and September US dollar at $5.1875. There were quite a few new transactions. Robbie was also reported to have bought in. Most foreign British and American banks sold out. The situation stabilized at midday, with British gold closing at 3/8d per 1.09375 and the US dollar at $5.1875.</p>
<p>British and American Currencies Both See Tightening as a Result</p>
<p>In the afternoon, importers bought even more aggressively, causing HSBC's small counter US dollar rate to shrink by .0625 to $5.125. Speculators were also buying in secretly. Later, it was reported that HSBC had shrunk the rate for larger settlements to $5, and the market tightened even further until the 3:30 PM close. Spot to September futures were British currency at 3/8d per 1.0625 and the US dollar at $5.125, which was tighter than the previous day's closing price by 0.046875 for British currency and 0.09375 for the US dollar.  Inclined toward Gold, Competing for the Throne; Highest Price Seen Was $8,550</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for bullion was quiet, but the situation suddenly became active because there were new transactions being made for the current September foreign exchange, and because speculators were buying due to the tightening trend. It was also rumored that Hong Kong telegrams were maintaining the local US dollar rate at only $5. People from all sides suddenly felt excited. Exchange houses and securities firms were actively buying, followed by gold firms. Therefore, the price rose from $6,696, gradually reaching $6,770. Later, Xinfeng Yongfu and Xiangxing Yong sold out, and the rising trend subsided, eventually seeing an increase of $67. The whole day's trading became active, totaling 50,000 to 60,000 taels. Spot soared again. In the morning, the silver house sold 50 taels to the securities house, priced at $8,400. Yuhao sold another 30 taels for $8,430. A certain silver house and Dafeng each sold 30 taels of Xinfeng Yong for $8,450. At noon, Chengji sold 50 taels of silver houses, priced at $8,430. In the afternoon, Chengji sold another 100 taels to Yida and 40 taels to Hesheng, priced at $8,430. Later, there were fewer sellers, and the price soared again. Tong Kang Yong Jin Chi Da sold 10 taels for $8,550, an unprecedented peak. Later, there were buyers at $8,500, an increase of $140. Jewelry also rose by $15, totaling $870.</p>
<p>Futures Soared by $67</p>
<p>Since the opening of the market for each bar (10 taels) at 9:15 AM was $6,700, $9 higher than the previous day's closing price, Xinfeng Yong, Dafeng, Yida, and Defu bought in due to the tightening of foreign exchange, and it immediately rose by more than $20 on the market. At around 10 o'clock, it rose to $6,726, as Xinyuan and Chengji sold out. It immediately fell back to around $6,715. Around 11 o'clock, Litai, Yida, and retail investors came to sell, falling another $20, entering the $6,700 range, falling to $6,696. However, because foreign exchange was slightly loose, Dingsheng, Dafeng, and Tong Kang Yong absorbed, and retail investors dragged in, rising more than $20 to $6,720. There were many floating positions selling out. At noon, the market closed at $6,712. The market opened at $6,715 at 2 PM in the afternoon, which was $3 higher. It then fell slightly back to $6,705. Suddenly, Yili, Xianghe, Yida, and Decheng were inclined to push aggressively, and it was heard that foreign exchange was tightening, with rumors that the local US dollar rate would be maintained at $5 in the future. People's hearts were greatly encouraged, and the price rose by more than $60 in a consistent buying trend, reaching $6,770. Afterwards, Dingsheng, Xinfeng Yong, and Xiangxing Yong vigorously sold, and the rise stopped a little, falling back by $20 to $6,750. The market closed at $6,758 at 3:30 PM, a sharp increase of $67 compared to the previous day. Based on the settlement price of the August US dollar at $5.12, it was $6,795, with a spread of $3-$7. Gold from the company's own brand and retail prices were $8,550, with the purchase price being $200 lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Listed at $870</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry silver per tael was initially listed at $55 by Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang. It rose by $10 at 11 o'clock and by another $5 at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, totaling $870, an increase of $15. The purchase price was reduced by $40, it was said.</p>
<h3>Most Foreign Currencies Rose, Few Fell</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw both spot and futures for bullion rise. British and American gold pounds also rose by $5 each. The trend of British gold notes was stable, and the market price remained stable. US dollar notes opened at $1,924. After the opening, Yintai and Xiangxing bought, raising it to $30. Rentai and Yongxing sold out, falling to $23. At noon, the market closed at $67. The market opened at $26 in the afternoon. After the opening, Tongxing, Dongsheng, Hengxiangyuan, Yongshunfeng and others bought, raising it to $41. Rentai Yong sold out, falling back to $1,938 at the close, an increase of $18 compared to the previous day. Spot also rose to $19.25. Hong Kong notes were trending firm and the market was steady. Canadian and Australian gold notes were both trending upwards. Japanese and Korean gold notes both fell slightly. The former retreated to $2.18, while the latter fell to $1.74.</p>
<h3>Securities: Many Short Covering in Public Bonds, with a Rebound of Around $1</h3>
<p>In the unofficial market for public bonds, the market continued to trend upwards yesterday, with the momentum increasing. In reality, most were short covering transactions. Very few were new longs, and there was almost no activity. As the market price rose due to short covering, floating longs took the opportunity to cash out. The market price had risen by two dollars and several cents in three consecutive days, and short covering transactions were gradually feeling satisfied, especially in the afternoon. The price continued to rise by around $1 in one day. Be careful of the reversal. In the morning, Dafeng, Yizhong, and Fengji were short covering in the front, and Pinhe, Jiufeng, and Gongmao continued to cover in the back. Lianyi also bought in slightly. Dechang, Dazhong, Jiucheng, and Xiexingyuan sold out at high prices. Hongda, Yichang, Runde, and Yitai also sold out. The market closed well at 67 cents. In the afternoon, Lianhe and Jiufeng continued to cover short positions, while Tongkang, Xieda, Runde, and Tiansheng absorbed accordingly. Grade C even raised the $68 barrier. Yiji, Renfeng, Tongxing, and Xiexingyuan sold out at high prices. Jiucheng also continued to sell out. Originally a short position on the table, it has turned into a long position on the table in three days. As a result, the market price continued to rise by 7 cents to $1.20. The turnover was $2.34 million. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of the Commercial Press were traded, priced at $95.</p>
<p>Also, the opening of the stock market in the Public Industry Institute was stable, but then it fell back again due to rumors, and the closing was still firm. There were quite a few transactions throughout the day. The Xiangtai stock fell back from $93.5 to $90.5. Rubber stocks remained stagnant.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Long and Short Positions Abound in the Industry; Yarn Market is Expensive and Soft; Actual Sales Do Not Seem to Be Thriving</h3>
<p>The yarn market is rising after hovering, but the trend is wavering again. In reality, the current yarn sales are not strong. The Hong Kong gangs only handled 60 bales of 32-count, 40-count, and 42-count yarn and thread. Only 20 count yarns were packed, so the price of Shuangma Factory's single is quite high. Those selling short are not very active, but securities gangs are slightly dragging in to see the rise. As for the industry, both long and short positions abound, so the market is expensive and soft. Some people also say that if the Shuangma Factory's single is around 1,600 yuan, those selling short will be more active. Therefore, there may be a struggle at the 600 yuan mark. However, the price of yarn and cloth at the current exchange is very firm due to more buyers than sellers, which affects the Shuangma Factory's single. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was $1,590, and the low price was $1,560. The initial transaction in the afternoon was $1,572, gradually falling to $1,564. Afterwards, the bid was good, and it immediately rose to $1,585. The final price was $1,580.</p>
<p>Shuangma's opening in the morning was well received, with many buyers. The first lot price was $1,580. It soon rose to $1,584.5. The market stood at this level for a long time, but sales for the Guangdong gang were sluggish. There were no transactions for 20-count yarn, and only a few bales of 32-count and 40-count yarn were handled. However, the long position on the table was quite strong, gradually rising to $1,590. Unexpectedly, as soon as the high price appeared, rumors resurfaced, and the exchange price fell by more than $10 at the same time. The market was filled with selling voices at once, falling by 20 to 30 yuan, and the low price saw $1,560. However, those who profited took the opportunity to buy in, and it rebounded to $1,572 at the close. The statistics for the transaction volume in half a day totaled 7,560 bales. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 60, counterparts 7,500</p>
<p>Statistics 7,560</p>
<p>The situation of the futures yarn market for Jinshuangma: The market opened in the morning, continuing the rising trend of the previous day. Gold firms and securities firms unanimously bought in, with each of the August and September contracts rising by $4 and $2 respectively. After the opening, there were still many new buyers and short covering, with August once reaching as high as $1,460, September at $1,534.5, and October at $1,512. After the entry, there was a widespread rumor of a conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, and many longs began to sell. August fell to $1,448 again, September at $1,518, and October at $1,526. Gradually recovering slightly, the midday close saw August fall by half a yuan, September fall by $5, and October fall by $5.5. The transaction volume was 12,090 bales. The market was still weak in the afternoon. After the entry, new buyers and short covering were eager again, and the price rose again, with the rebound in August being the largest and the remaining months slightly easing. The evening close saw August rise by $7 from the previous day, September rise by half a yuan, and October fall by half a yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,000 bales, an increase of 5,850 bales compared to the previous day. The opening, closing, high, and low prices for the day are recorded on the left (nominal bid prices).</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Good</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation still has a firm appearance, but factory demand is not very developed. Cotton merchants are unanimously upward-minded, so the situation is relatively good.</p>
<p>Another message: Although the international situation is still quite tense, the foreign cotton order transactions in Shanghai are somewhat enthusiastic due to the scarcity of cotton from the United States and India and the overseas cotton market being very firm. Apart from the relatively weak orders for Brazilian cotton yesterday, the purchase of Indian cotton was very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose first due to industry buying, but then fell back due to selling by the Southern gang and profit-taking by longs. As a result, the closing price was down 11-12 pounds compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell first due to selling by cotton merchants and profit-taking by longs, but then rebounded due to short covering and buying by spot merchants. As a result, yesterday's closing prices rose by 5-6 robis for most months, except for White Locke, which fell by 1 robi for the July-August period. The opening market is predicted to be down 2.25 robis today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Large Quantities of Cloth are Shipped to Hong Kong; Sales Prices are Raised Again</h3>
<p>Factory cloth: The market rose because large quantities of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, and purchasing by dyeing factories and customer gangs increased. Factory hands were very tight, so the sales prices of spot goods were raised again. White fine cloth and twill rose by about 50 cents per bolt, coarse cloth rose by 25 cents per bolt, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 50 cents. More than 800 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled more than 600 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth. Nanyang gangs handled more than 300 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, twill, bleached cloth, and other items. Beilu Yanjin gangs handled more than 200 pieces of woolen cloth, coarse and fine cloth, and other items.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth: The exchange first weakened and then rose yesterday, with a firm trend, while the spot market continued to rely on real demand, with prices continuing to rise. White fine twill rose by 15 cents to 50 cents per bolt. Longtou fine cloth rose by 15 cents, closing at $52.75. The popular coloured goods, Four Gentlemen Serge, saw a particularly strong rising trend due to scavenging by the Tianjin gang and this street. New tax new bill has gradually risen to $1.74, new bill old tax $1.7275, old bill old tax $1.6775.</p>
<h3>Grains: Government-Sold Rice Enters the Market; Rice Prices are Difficult to Raise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice gradually trended downwards, with both futures and spot goods declining, down by a small amount of $2-3 compared to the previous market. The current inventory is sufficient, and new arrivals are constant. All of the Java, Kofu, Burmese, and Siamese rice that was previously ordered in June and July will be arriving in Shanghai. It is difficult for floating longs and retail investors to store large quantities, so they are continuously selling out in the market. New hoarding is stagnant, and actual sales are weak. There is Hong Kong-Vietnamese government-sold rice on the market on this street, lacking appetite. The ball-rolling gangs also lack the opportunity to manipulate the market, so the market price cannot be supported and is falling. Yinghua’s broken rice has declined from $104 to $103. Grade 2 Siamese rice is currently $136, with futures at $137-138. Xiaojiao spot is $146.5, with futures falling from $146 to $145.5. The close was $2-3 lower than the previous market. Grade 1 Saigon Gao ranged from $131 to $129, Grade 2 $120, old $124, Grade 1 Siamese $126.5, Chong-1 $120, Grade 2 $117-118, Min Dang Gao $130.05, Jue $122, $120, Kofu rice $126-127, Xiaojiao Bank Wharf initially $120, then only $118, outside wharf from $119.5, then to $117, Jue $115-116, broken tip $91, $90. More than 7,000 bags of spot rice were traded, with 700 tons from Yinghua.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica rice is also experiencing sluggish sales due to high prices and continued strong supply. The selling intention is soft, and a declining trend continues. Early and late rice from Nan Gang opened at $150 to $147, a huge drop of $3. The Wuxi original package white japonica rice, however, is holding up better due to scarcity, only depreciating by $1. It opened at $145. Glutinous rice is also softened by the impact of various goods. Hong Kong white opened high from $124-125 to $120, national glutinous rice $125-126, glutinous green beans not opened.</p>
<p>Pudong's new japonica rice has already been launched, totaling seven stone. It is sold by Wufengtai Factory after milling. It opened at $156. However, the rice sample was first released to promote sales in advance. Yesterday can be called the true market. Although there was a lack of water this year due to the Geng year rains, the quality is still not bad, similar to last year. It is said to be 80% of the normal year's yield.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Decline Slightly; 6,000 Bags of Foreign Flour Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market continued to decline because the customer appetite remained quiet and hoarding households were not interested. However, the Jinlong flour was more active in trading, opening at $31.5 and then sharply declining to $31.1. Therefore, hoarding households came to ask about prices and took advantage of the low price to absorb, gradually recovering to $31.5, still a small amount of 10 cents lower than the previous day. This flour was $34, with no other transactions.</p>
<p>In addition, foreign flour continues to be shipped in. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship docked at our wharf on the Bund of the French Concession yesterday afternoon, bringing 6,000 bags of flour shipped from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, coarse white rebounded because it had fallen for several consecutive days, with the drop reaching $4-5, and the price position was gradually suitable. It is normal for the price to rebound after extreme fatigue. The company's futures for 24 coarse white with a maturity date of August 10 was initially $100.009, then rose to $101.5, and then returned to $100.05, eventually rising to $101.2, $102, $102.2, $101.8, $102.3, an increase of $1.55. The maturity date of August 20 at $101.9, $102.9, $101.9, $102.9, and then rising to $104.45, and then slightly loosened to $103.5 and $103.65, an increase of $1.15. The public association spot 24 coarse white for July arrivals at $101.8 and $103.5, an increase of $2.5, June at $100.3 to $101.5, corrected $103, May at $100.005, $101.3, and $102.5, all rising by $2.</p>
<p>In addition, 300 bags of sugar were imported on the 5th, shipped from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japan Freezes Raw Silk in the Occupied Areas; The Silk Industry is Dying Out</h3>
<p>Since the freezing of funds, the overseas market for raw silk has stopped trading. Although there have still been sporadic transactions in the Shanghai silk market this week, the question of whether this raw silk can be exported is still a problem. According to a telegram from Tokyo yesterday, raw silk in Central China was also frozen and not allowed to be exported. According to reliable sources, small silk mills in the Hangjiahu area of the interior have now been closed, and Central China has also stopped buying local silk. This news may confirm that the above telegram will become a reality. Therefore, the hope for raw silk exports from Shanghai is currently slim. Some wise people have developed in the free areas of the interior, so the silk industry in Shanghai and the occupied areas is hopeless, but the silk industry in the vast interior is thriving.</p>
<h3>Sugarcane and Cane Sugar (3) (China Section)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>When did the Chinese people learn to make cane sugar themselves? According to the French Encyclopedia, "In ancient times, the Chinese also knew—previously India was mentioned, hence the addition of 'also'—how to extract the sugar content from sugarcane: because on very ancient ceramics, one can find traces of their syrup-making techniques." However, can we definitively say that these traces are from "sugarcane"? Or are they from the "Yi Tang" (饴餳), the maltose that the Chinese have known how to make since ancient times? It is difficult for us to determine. Moreover, the authenticity and dating of ceramics are highly debatable, so this passage is not credible. To be realistic: the era when the Chinese began to learn how to make cane sugar is recorded in authentic national history books. According to the "Tang Shu Xiyu Zhuan" (History of the Tang Dynasty, Records of the Western Regions), "Magadha (India), in the 21st year of Zhenguan—647 AD—first sent envoys to communicate with the Emperor. Emperor Taizong sent envoys to obtain the method of boiling sugar; and ordered Yangzhou to present various sugarcane, and the squeezed juice was processed according to the method, and the color was far better than that of the Western Regions." The Song Dynasty poet Lu You supplemented this memorable event in his "Lao Xue An Bi Ji" (Notes from the Old Learning Hut), saying, "Wen Renmaode said: Granulated sugar originally did not exist in China. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, it was presented as tribute from a foreign country. When asked of its envoys, 'What is this?' they said, 'It is made by boiling sugarcane juice.' Using their method, it was boiled and made, and it was equal to that of the foreign country." Therefore, the middle of the seventh century AD—around 650—is the true beginning of when the Chinese truly learned to make cane sugar themselves. However, what was made at that time was naturally the primitive, reddish-brown, coarse granulated sugar. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Problem of Student Conduct</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>My writing relationship with Shen Bao has lasted for nearly a dozen years, so I often feel very concerned about everything about Shen Bao, especially its vigorous and energetic spirit, which makes me feel very happy when I think of it. This launch of the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund, its design is extremely thorough, and the measures are also very reasonable. Seeing the enthusiastic donations from all parties in the past half month is even more exciting.</p>
<p>My old friend Dr. Ding Huikang has no connection with Shen Bao, but he is naturally warm-hearted and willing to contribute money and effort to everything, so he has donated the most (including fundraising on his behalf). This matter has powerfully moved me. Although I am a destitute literary beggar with little strength, I can only allocate 30 yuan from the稿费 fees I wrote for "Autumn Begonia" last month as a donation, but my heart is equally boiling.</p>
<p>The income of writers is very meager, so I absolutely do not want other writers to follow suit; because relying on us to donate this little money is really too little! I only ask the speculators and wealth-makers to touch their consciences when they send stacks of new banknotes to singing and dancing halls, and donate half of it to the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund; given the number of people in Shanghai who are profiting from the national crisis, I dare bet my head that if they are all willing to "generously donate," 100,000 or 200,000 would not be a problem!</p>
<p>At the same time, I would also like to contribute an extremely important point to the gentlemen in charge of organizing: when approving student aid, student conduct must be listed as the first requirement. We see those male students dressed like foreign hooligans and female students dressed like dance hostesses in front of cinemas and dance halls, and we feel very sad in our hearts; and like a few days ago in the newspaper, there was a news story about three young students harassing a woman on the road and also injuring her husband, which is really too absurd! I dare not say that the conduct of every student in Shanghai is bad, but those who are both morally and academically excellent are truly rare – the schools do not pay attention at all – but we know that knowledge is like wings to a tiger for a person with bad character. If the money that everyone has worked so hard to donate is used to help young people with bad character to go to school, it would be too regrettable! Therefore, I sincerely hope that those in charge of this newspaper can pay special attention to this point! Of course, it is not enough to just pay attention to the individual actions of young people. On the one hand, we must urge schools to improve moral education.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Qin Shouou generously helps students with his writing income, which is the best nutrient for cultivating students. We express our gratitude on behalf of the students. His opinion on student conduct can be said to be incisive and thought-provoking. This newspaper keeps in contact in many ways during the "academic" and "conduct" investigation of young people applying for student aid, and is not afraid to ask for details, so as to explore its depths; this is exactly in line with Mr. Qin's idea and can be used to question readers.</p>
<h3>Observations at a Teahouse</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>Thanks to a few self-proclaimed "progressive youth" friends, I "progressed" to a teahouse yesterday.</p>
<p>Not to brag, I have indeed been to a teahouse before; but because the previous time was "for business," I had never observed it. This time, since it was a "casual visit," I naturally put on the air of Ah Q admiring the little nun.</p>
<p>First of all, I noticed the people. It seems that the entire 20th century belongs to the youth. Usually, old men should go to teahouses, but regrettably, there wasn't even a slightly longer beard!</p>
<p>Secondly, I noticed the conversation. Forgive me, have mercy on me, I couldn't understand a single word! Some were not Chinese, I didn't understand; some were jargon, I didn't understand; some were "specialized names," and I still didn't understand...</p>
<p>Third? One of my "progressive youth" friends was furiously shouting "Stan Kang": "Little × is really not pretty, ××'s × sister is monopolizing one person to dance!"</p>
<p>The above three observations are all facts, I dare not fabricate rumors to "confuse the public." I hereby declare.</p>
<h3>How to Manage Fluorescent Lights</h3>
<p>— Zhong Han</p>
<p>Fluorescent lights are not as simple and easy to manage as tungsten filament lamps. Careful switching is essential, otherwise the bulbs are easily damaged and expensive to replace. The following points are for users to pay special attention to:</p>
<p>(1) If both ends or one end of the bulb turn deep black, and sometimes many blackish-purple circles are found near both ends, the bulb is no longer usable.</p>
<p>(2) Sudden flickering of an old lamp is also a sign that the bulb is about to fail. For new or recently used bulbs, the problem must be in the starting mechanism, and a new switch should be used to replace it.</p>
<p>(3) After turning on the power, if the lamp does not light up or lights up slowly, the reason is that the lamp holder is loose, the contact point is not good, and the current cannot easily pass through. The lamp holder should be tightened.</p>
<p>(4) If the middle of the lamp is dark and only the ends are lit, the problem is that the starting small cylinder has lost its adjustment function.</p>
<p>(5) After prolonged use, thin, straight lines often appear on the bulb. This is because the mercury inside condenses when cold. Sometimes, when the bulb is emitting light, it encounters cold objects outside, and the mercury will condense. Black spots may also be found on any part of the bulb. The method is to turn the bulb 180 degrees and install it, so that the mercury can be heated and re-evaporated.</p>
<p>(6) If a half-inch-wide black circle suddenly surrounds half of the bulb at both ends or one end of the bulb, replace the starter quickly, otherwise the bulb will be damaged, because the starting current is too high.</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia's body swayed a few times suddenly, as if about to faint, panicking Mei Bao quickly climbed up from the ground and used all her strength to support him.</p>
<p>"Let go, let's talk while sitting down!" Autumn Begonia calmed down, and his anger subsided much more than before. But he did not dare to let go, and still supported him forcefully, helping him walk to a bamboo chair to sit down. She was busy squatting down to clean up the tile shards scattered all over the ground.</p>
<p>"Thank goodness you haven't written that IOU to him yet!" After the anger subsided, he seemed very tired and could only speak slowly in a very low voice, "Mei Bao, acting is not an easy way to make money. You are too young, you almost fell into their trap, don't go there again! You can eat any kind of food, but never eat the food of acting!"</p>
<p>He said the last two sentences almost word by word. Although his voice was very low, it was not difficult for Mei Bao to hear the pity in his heart.</p>
<p>"Now that my illness is cured, the younger brother of Little Dog is still helping in the theater, I can take care of myself at home..." He sighed deeply and paused for two or three minutes before he could continue: "Regardless of whether you can graduate next year or not, there are at least two more months left for this semester, you should go back to the city as soon as possible!"</p>
<p>After Mei Bao picked up the larger pieces, because there were still many brick chips and tea leaves scattered on the ground, she grabbed a broom and started sweeping. (177)</p>
<p>Here and Now</p>
<h3>First Day Selling Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Xinghua</p>
<p>"Studying, what's the use of studying! I told you a long time ago to go to a foreign cloth store to learn business, but you refused. Now what! After graduating from high school, you can't find a job anywhere. If you do find one, it requires a deposit of one thousand yuan. If you had learned business back then, you could have earned some wages, and you could be a boss now. Hey! Ah Xing, don't think it's bad, you can only sell newspapers now to supplement the household."</p>
<p>I also felt ashamed when I thought about it. I had eaten white rice at home for more than ten years, and now that I had graduated from high school, I couldn't even find a small job. No wonder Dad was angry. However, I really didn't want to sell newspapers.</p>
<p>"Hey! Ah Xing, don't think that the occupation of selling newspapers is lowly. Haven't you heard of college students pulling rickshaws? I think you should listen to me. If there is a noble occupation in the future, you can still change careers. It's not good to eat your parents' rice for the rest of your life."</p>
<p>The next day, I took off my long gown, received dozens of newspapers, and ran around on the street. I hung my head, and my heart felt like it was pierced with swords. Glancing sideways, it seemed that everyone around was mocking me. My throat felt like it was blocked with a wooden block, and I couldn't shout. Other newspaper vendors were straining their vocal cords: "Old Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Zhongmei Ribao... Want to see the Soviet counter-offensive victory!" Business was naturally booming.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a streamlined car stopped beside me, and two people jumped out – a man and a woman. Alas! The man was my classmate Mr. Li, dressed in Western clothes. I hurriedly lowered my head, pretending to read the news in the newspaper.</p>
<p>"Hey! Do you have the桃紅色 "Peach Red" News?" It was his voice.</p>
<p>"Uh! No, no--" My heart was anxious, and my face was flushed.</p>
<p>"Then, do you have the ×× Movie News?"</p>
<p>"No, neither, neither--"</p>
<p>He said to the woman:</p>
<p>"This newspaper vendor looks strangely familiar. Where have I seen him before? Oh! I remember...."</p>
<p>If there was a hole in the road at that time, I was afraid I would have burrowed down.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Could this poor kid be your classmate? Don't daydream. Hurry up to ×××, I'm afraid we won't make it to the first show of ××× this afternoon!" The woman said. They got in the car and left.</p>
<p>Great benefactor! Great benefactor. If it weren't for this lady at that time, I don't know where my face would have been lost. I won't be able to repay this great kindness even if I am a cow or a horse in the next life.</p>
<p>I held a stack of newspapers and stood blankly on the street. I thought of the grand occasion at graduation. "Today is the fragrance of peaches and plums, tomorrow is the pillar of society."</p>
<p>Alas! Pillar?</p>
<h3>Returning Lost Items</h3>
<p>— Yaoyao</p>
<p>A little urchin was using a key to open the back door of a family at the entrance of the alley.</p>
<p>"What are you doing furtively?" A policeman walked over and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>The little urchin said tremblingly, "Sir, I found a key here, and I don't know which family lost it, so I wanted to try it on the locks of each family so that I could return it to its original owner." After saying that, he gave a wry smile.</p>
<p>The policeman listened and said with a smile, "In that case, you still have the virtue of returning lost items!"</p>
<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Junjun</p>
<p>To be merely a clothes rack in front of a clothing store, there is no value to life. (George Bernard Shaw)</p>
<p>Walking through an open door is nothing extraordinary; breaking open a closed door is what is difficult and valuable. (Jean Racine)</p>
<h3>Nervous Breakdown</h3>
<p>— Zhang Genyuan</p>
<p>My brain is sick, probably some kind of nervous breakdown.</p>
<p>All day long, I am using my brain, I am thinking, my brain often goes from slight flashes of pain to almost cracking open. I think too hard, that's for sure. It's only when you think too hard that it hurts like this. What am I thinking about all day long! It's all vague, empty. I don't know what kind of results I will think of. The result is just a severe headache. This is a nervous breakdown! For sure, otherwise, I'm being foolish. Why should I make my brain suffer like this?</p>
<p>I don't want to think, but I can't help but think. The price of rice and the price of coal have risen to eat people. In the past, I rarely bothered to use my brain, but now I want to think more to make it worthwhile, otherwise I'll be sorry for the expensive rice, coal, and everything else that has risen in price.</p>
<p>But a nervous breakdown is definitely a nervous breakdown, right? The sky won't fall, what's the use of thinking?</p>
<p>I am not as good as others, I only know how to worry about things. In this day and age, trying to make a living, it's no wonder I'm developing a nervous breakdown!</p>
<p>Daydreaming and nervous breakdown got married, alas!</p>

<h3>Liu School Laosheng Chen Hongsheng Comes to Shanghai to Perform</h3>
<p>— Muyun</p>
<p>Today, when talking about Laosheng, almost all of them follow the Yu, Ma, and Tan schools, and the strengths of the three schools are almost the same in different ways, all of which are decadent and soft sounds. The tunes they sing are mostly modified based on their innate talents. However, recently, the situation has changed slightly, because decadent sounds imply signs of national demise, which are not as good as the majestic sounds of Huangzhong Dalu (Yellow Bell Great Lyu), which are enough to inspire people to reflect deeply. Most people who practice Yu do not have a good voice, so they use the sound of their dantian to devote themselves to unrestrained ups and downs. There is no one more skilled and extensive in this art, but there is no Bole in the world. How can a thousand-mile horse not be buried in the wilderness! My friends Yang Baosen and Tao Weichu are both the most diligent in learning Yu. What Yu sings is not only the rough outline, but almost every word of the Gongche, inside and outside the string, is also required to be accurate. Otherwise, they regard it as an insult to Yu. Their superstition is so deep. Until today, Weichu is still destitute, and Baosen's situation is not much better. It is not as good as Baozhong's knowing the difficulty and retreating, and using the Qin to live a comfortable and leisurely life.</p>
<p>In summary, it is not that Tan, Yu, and Ma are not worth learning, nor that learning them will ruin the voice. In fact, if one has talent, there is no need to be particular about Yu, Ma, and Tan. Gao Qingkui was known as a great hodgepodge. After Gao lost his voice, people realized the value of a voice. Song Baoluo performed at the Tianchan Theater, and the reason why he was popular was his voice. Song's voice is not complete in five tones. The high notes are more than enough, but the low notes are not round enough. What is even more Song's big problem is that he is not good at singing. When singing, he often has a feminine sound. Therefore, when Song performs, it is inseparable from his brother's Qin. Song's skills are not worth mentioning, but why is he popular? Are all the Zhou Langs in Shanghai laymen? No, that's not it. Song is popular because of his voice. The people of Shanghai have long heard the decadent sounds of Tan and Ma, and suddenly changing to Song's high-pitched voice, they feel a different flavor, so they all flock to it. Recently, I heard that the owner of Tianchan hired a Laosheng from the south. Who is this person? It is Chen Hongsheng, a giant in the Liu school. Chen is a second-generation disciple of Liu Hongsheng. His voice is even better than Song's, and his ups and downs are like Tan and Yu, but he does not lose the charm of Huangzhong Dalu. His style is close to Ma. All the dramas he can perform are the complete Liu's Three Chops and One Bump, which is completely different from Song. He has already led his sister Chen Guilan to the south. He arrived in Tanggu on the 4th, and will arrive in Shanghai tonight (6th). The date of his debut is probably not more than ten days.</p>
<h3>I Love "Border Town Story"</h3>
<p>— Sha Fei</p>
<p>After watching "Border Town Story," what has been lingering in my mind are some floating shadows of the masses. The whole play is divided into five acts. The story is about a remote county town in the southwest border area. There are very rich gold mines there. Most of the local people use traditional methods to pan for gold to maintain their lives. The government wants to use machines to mine in large quantities. After many difficulties, they finally achieve their goal. In the middle, there are naturally clowns drilling and sabotaging. However, the influence of justice finally makes the masses take on their responsibilities and move towards the vast wilderness.</p>
<p>The first act is a scene of towering mountains and ridges. There are more than a dozen actors on the stage. Er Niuwa (Bai Chen), who is holding an axe, is standing on the top of the mountain, looking around. Tian Zhendong plays Wan Zhidada, and his makeup is the most fascinating to the audience. His face is majestic, his eyes are divine, and his chest is covered with black hair. His silly appearance is performed to the extreme. The villain Yin Xiaoshan (Han Fei) suddenly staggers out from backstage, shaking a cattail fan. His front teeth are protruding, and his speech is strangely sinister and interesting, especially the jump he takes before leaving, like a living monkey. The end of this scene is that Commissioner Yang (Chang Jun) brings Lao Gou (Shi Yuan) to the top of the mountain and is ambushed by the miners. He fights with Wan Zhidada, and as a result, Wan Zhidada suffers a little loss, thus sowing the seeds of enmity.</p>
<p>The second act is a bedroom scene. Yin Xiaoshan introduces Wan Zhidada's daughter Fengwa (Yingzi) to be an inside line. This scene is full of interconnected laughs. Shi Yuan's Shandong Mandarin is relaxed and funny, and Yingzi's teasing of Commissioner Yang shows the loveliness of a foreign girl everywhere.</p>
<p>The third act is a forest. Lao Gou gives Fengwa a photo. Later, Technician Zhang (Shen Cao) comes, and Wang Yiqing (Zhang Fa) also comes. The director's driving away of Shi Yuan and Ying is clever. With a "bang," the mine explodes. Commissioner Yang risks his life to rescue them. This scene is full of Yan Jun's enthusiasm, natural and lively, which is indeed commendable. The fifth act is on a wasteland. Dadouwai gathers the masses, and Yin Xiaoshan stands on a high tree, singing and playing by himself. Han Fei's every move is realistic, portraying the outline of a traitor, making people fascinated. The masses are deceived by Yin Xiaoshan and prepare to follow him. However, Er Niuwa rushes in with the murder weapon that Old Master Ba was secretly attacked with, and as a result, Wang Yiqing is tied up. Yin Xiaoshan walks to the door triumphantly. Commissioner Yang and Wan Zhidada rush back from the province. Yan Jun exposes the true face of the traitor, which makes the masses understand. So Yin Xiaoshan opens fire to demonstrate, and Fengwa shields Commissioner Yang with her body and is seriously injured. Wan Zhidada chases out and is also seriously injured, but Yin Xiaoshan cannot escape the circle of death. When Fengwa closes her eyes, she takes out a photo that Lao Gou gave her from her chest and hands it to Commissioner Yang, which means, "You must not forget that there is such an extraordinary woman in the world."</p>
<p>I love "Border Town Story" very much, and I would like to recommend this play to young men and women on the isolated island.</p>
<h3>A Record of Famous Amateur Performers' Charity Performance in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Choucheng</p>
<p>There are more and more famous amateur performers from Shanghai in Hong Kong, including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yuanlong, Xu Qinfang, Qian Liying, etc., more than a dozen people in total, both men and women, with Jing, Dan, Sheng, and Chou all available. Recently, initiated by Mr. Shen Qiuyan, in conjunction with Southern China movie stars Xue Juexian and Tang Xueqing and other famous amateur performers such as Yang Yihua and Cheng Jianxia, a charity performance of Peking Opera was held for two days. All ticket revenue was donated to the country for relief and disaster assistance. A preparatory committee was first formed, with Wang Xiaolai as chairman, and Wu Jiangfeng and Guo Yunfeng arranged the repertoire. Mr. Shen is skilled in Xiaosheng, and his wife is skilled in Qingyi, studying the Cheng School, which is absolutely divine-like. The husband and wife sing together, which is admired by everyone. At the opening of the night show on the first day, Mei Lanfang was invited to reveal the curtain, adding a lot of color. The performances included Lin Daji's "Bie Yao," Zai Huazhen's "Xue Li Saves the Emperor," Zhang Hua Jin Chongtao's "Empty City Stratagem," Ye Shun'sheng Qian Liying's "Hitting the Fisherman and Killing the Family," Chen Yousheng Zhang Yingming's "Pearl Curtain Village," Li Yunchu's "Cosmic Wind," Xue Juexian's "Chasing Han Xin," Xu Qinfang Tang Xueqing's "Fourth Son Visits His Mother," and Shao Dabao (playing Su San) and Shen Qiuyan (playing the prison guard)'s "Su San Qijie," which attracted the most attention. Coupled with Cao Zhigong's Chong Gongdao, it was even more hilarious. The next day, at the daytime performance, Zhang Yizhai and Ge Futian performed "Cutting the Yellow Robe," with equal skill and strength. Wu Jiangfeng, Zhong Qiying, and Lu Zhiqing's "Yellow Crane Tower" was also quite hard-working. Sun Wanpu and Chen Xiangtan performed "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao," which was激昂慷慨 and exciting. The final show, Xue Juexian (playing Zhang Jiaxiang) and Wang Yuanlong (playing Xiang Daren)'s "Three Versions of Iron Rooster," were giants from the north and south film circles, with great differences in their styles, and the applause was thunderous. At the night show, Shen Beiping and Jin Chongtao's "Golden Terrace," Wu Hesheng and Zhong Gen's "First Righteous Deed Treasure," and Wang Yuanlong and Zhong Qiying's "Jizhou City" were all flawless. However, Li Shengsheng and Xu Qinfang's "Catching and Releasing Cao" were the most popular. It is said that Mr. Li has lived in Beiping for a long time and is friends with Hou Xirui, Liu Yanting, Jiang Shaoqiu, Liu Lianrong, etc., so he knows many plays. Ms. Xu has received careful teaching from a certain famous actor, and she is proficient in all Laosheng plays, with a reputation for correct pronunciation, clean voice, and clean movements. Two difficulties were combined, complementing each other, and the final show, Xue Juexian (playing Guan Gong)'s "Ancient City Meeting," was both singing and acting, perfect in every way, so the overseas Chinese were all very happy after reading it.</p>
<p>Twenty-seventh Xiao Changhua</p>
<p>Xiao Changhua, nicknamed Ershun, is a clown. In recent years, clown talents have declined, and Changhua has accumulated capital and prestige, so he is regarded as the spiritual light of the Lu Temple in this field. Changhua's plays are humorous and joking, not as good as the late Zhang Wenbin, but more broad and profound. He has been a teacher at the Fu Liancheng Peking Opera school for a long time. Today, most of the disciples who graduated from Fu Liancheng are his students. Although Changhua practices the clown role, in the school, Sheng and Dan also receive his teaching. Changhua's square-hat clown is quite famous. Tang Qin in "Stabbing Tang" and Jiang Gan in "Stealing the Book" are especially famous at the time. However, listening to his plays, there is no scholarly air and little restraint. It is only slightly better than Wang Changlin's vulgar crudeness. Where there is a lack of cinnabar, red soil is precious. Those who talk about clowns still have to mention Xiao Ershun first, which is also a little bit of the rise and fall of the past and present!</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Yuan Yuan's Delicate Handwriting on Exquisite Silk</p>
<p>It was the weather of late spring, the third month, when the grasses of Jiangnan grew lush, and various flowers blossomed into trees. The gentle, bright sunshine illuminated the fields, which were wrapped in green, red, yellow, and purple hues, resembling a colorful carpet of brocade and clouds. The orioles in the sky flew and sang with melodious delight, chanting the spring of the earth. On a stretch of clear water in Hengtang outside Suzhou City, with fragrant orchids lining the banks for ten miles, a scholar's boat glided leisurely amidst the green mountains and clear waters, heading towards Yin Yan. In the front cabin of the boat, there was a Wu Palace beauty of seventeen or eighteen years old, with her hair styled in a swirling cloud, dressed in exquisite silk and jade sleeves. Her figure was exceedingly graceful and alluring. She peered out from the window, gazing at the opposite Lion Mountain. Her face was like an egg, neither too fat nor too thin, but plump, fair, and radiant. Her delicate eyebrows, melting autumn waters, a nose like fine jade, cheeks like peach blossoms, complementing a small, round mouth—truly, adding an inch would be too long, subtracting an inch would be too short. It was as if Heaven had deliberately used its ingenious craftsmanship to create this charming and beautiful girl from the spiritual essence of mountains and rivers. In this era of war and chaos, she would enact some soul-stirring, bone-consuming, sorrowful deeds, adorning a page in the history of the rise and fall of the nation, as it is said, "The bones of the entire family have turned to ashes, but the beauty of a generation shines upon the historical record." Beside her, standing shoulder to shoulder, was a handsome young man of about twenty, pointing out the nearby mountains and waters, laughing and talking. This pair of human lovebirds was no different from celestial immortals. Who exactly were they? At this time, although the beauties of the north were handsome, they could never match the alluring charm of the beauties of Jiangnan. Although the times were filled with turmoil and unrest, the pear garden opera troupes still performed with stringed instruments and clamorous music, pretending to be at peace. Allowing them to indulge in extreme luxury by the Qinhuai River and the Suzhou Terrace, with lit pavilions and boats filled with flutes and drums. (134)</p>
