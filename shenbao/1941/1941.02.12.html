<h3 id="c18">世界局勢剖析 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>美國「租借法案」在衆議院通過之後，參議院當亦順利通過，自此國際局勢將要有重大的開展，而目前正在大家屛息期待之中。</p>
<p>析言國際局勢；僅僅從嚴格的外交範圍來說，去年九月德義日三國同盟的正式宣佈，實在是一舉而把牠們外交上的主動和運用，根本自行封鎖了；三國因此剩餘的，祗是軍事上及戰略上的主動地位。根據這一盟約，牠們雖有採取任何認爲必要動作的自由，得向任何方向侵襲，然而揭穿了「新秩序」建立者的面目之後，對於三國以外的任何他國有什麼外交運用可言，祗有要求或脅迫承認牠們的「新秩序」，此外不再有外交。四個多月來，德義在歐洲的種種外交活動，以及日本對英美，對蘇聯的各種姿態，都是集中在取得列國對「新秩序」的承認或諒解。在過去現在及將來，這些當然不會有什麼效果。亦因爲它們的基本根據，是純粹的暴力主義，所以最値得注意的，還是它們到底怎樣運用自身的攻勢，到底向那一對象先施用暴力。當日本侵入越南時，大家所預料的，不是北上進攻中國的滇桂，便是實行所謂「南進」；而德國侵入羅馬尼亞，當義大利進攻希臘及在非洲同時用兵的時候，大家所担心的，第一是巴爾幹各國及土耳其的命運，其次是英國在地中海及紅海，在非洲，在中東，近東的防禦。</p>
<p>假如三國攻勢眞能得利，則反對「新秩序」的中英美等國，就要始終處在防禦的地位，各自努力於個別抵抗三國的前進，然而事實上却並不如此。這在義大利在歐非兩洲遭受重大挫折的同時，日本在亞洲也因爲美國態度的意外强硬，而陷入了北上及南進皆不可能的窘境。這樣形勢下，就給予中英美等國以一個軍事上由守變攻，由被動爭主動的大好機會。美國這一次「租借法案」，就是這一著的前奏，而英國近來大規模的打擊義大利，却已經是攻勢的開端了。</p>
<p>美國朝野各方面對於「租借法案」的闡明，已經表示得明明白白，牠的最大意義，就是澈底擊敗德義日；英國首相邱吉爾前天的演說裏，也陳述了先行擊潰義大利，然後再打敗德國，取得最後勝利的計劃；中國當局最近與美國接洽援助時，也曾經强調了反攻的決心。所以從這一方面看起來，中英美等國今後各種舉措最核心的內容，即是集中致力於通力合作，分別擊潰德義日。至於德義日方面，它們對於所謂「新秩序」也者，如果一天不放棄，則它們當前一切的舉措，就必須以兩個最迫切的工作爲中心：（一）如何阻止美國應援各民治國家的實際生效，（二）如何挽救義大利覆敗得末運。這兩方面，就搆成了目下及最近將來整個國際局勢演變的主流。</p>
<p>以中英美間的合作而論，美因「租借法案」通過之後，首先將有大批的飛機輸入英倫三島，使英國除了進攻義大利外，再有充足的機數，防禦本國的天空，及保護阻止德國陸軍渡海的艦隊。一旦英國空軍與德國平衡或甚至超出時，德國即喪失了所恃以侵人英倫三島的唯一武器的優勢，而英本國的戰局亦就可以絕對穩定下來。至於中國一旦擁有大批飛機之後，大反攻的最重要的條件之一，也就宣告了完成。在海軍方面，美國的兩洋艦隊程序，當然要積極提早完成，一旦牠的太平洋艦隊完全在各根據地集中，與英國在南太平艦隊合作時，日本的艦隊就陷入了堅固的包圍，不獨援助德義在歐洲非洲作戰不可能，南進不可能，甚至連保護自己海外商業的擴張，也將完全不可能了。至於義大利的艦隊，現在還可以免避與英艦作戰，暫獲苟安，那時候，美國把大批軍艦加入英國艦隊之後，義大利海軍也就不得不冒險一戰，以企突破重圍，然而這是必敗無疑的。英美完全控制海面之後，德義日三國便陷入了空前的大封鎖，然後分別束手，等候最後的崩潰。這所謂崩潰，不一定須遭受反攻，但中英那時以新生力量反攻的氣勢，却一定絕非三國所能抵擋。</p>
<p>再以德義日阻止美國援助各民冶國而論，這些時來，它們所做的種種恐嚇破壞工作，由這次「租借法案」的通過，已經被宣告了原則上的完全失敗；今後它們祗有借重於實際行動，怎樣使中英諸國受援助陷於不可能，怎樣美國自動赴援各國成爲不可能。出此行動，惟有搶先擊敗各被侵略國，使它們等不到接受美國的援助就覆敗；不然，惟有逕行對美進攻。除此之外，怎樣挽救義大利即將潰敗的命運，當亦爲德日方面所認爲當務之亟。以所有可能的途徑估計起來，大槪德軍經由巴爾幹半島的保加利亞，以聲援義大利，困擾地中海，目前由於蘇聯與土耳其態度的堅決，是不可能的。僅剩的方法：一是通過南斯拉夫；一是德國空軍的對義援助，現在正在加緊之中，但因此却也分散了對英進攻的力量，此其結果，對於兩方的戰鬥總力不生影響，但如果德義聯合空軍，可以挫弱英國地中海上覇權的話，則也許它們可以企圖以德國陸軍開到非洲，助義大利作戰。不過，挽救義大利最遊效的第三個辦法，還是由德國直接進攻英國，或由日本在東方進襲英國的屬地，使英國分散它的力量和注意。</p>
<p>然而總觀近頃國際形勢，即以軍事上得主動而論，在一天一天的轉移入於中英美等國的手中；故最近將來，德義日倘若不能有何驚人的舉動，則它們即將陷入失却一切主動的機運，並失却了一切獲勝的希望。</p>

<p>本年工部局董事選舉、係依據洋涇浜地皮章程第十八條之規定、按照自一八六九年以來、始終未變更之制度與方法辦理、維持英美日五二二比例席數、預料英美僑民方面所採之聯台陣綫、必可繼續獲取勝利、而日方欲變更租界現狀之企圖、終將失敗、詎昨日於工部局公報中、發現日方竟擬破壞歷年所採用之選舉制度與方法、建議實行一人一票制、以擊敗敵對方面、此一行動之發展、必爲全滬中外市民所重視也、爰工部局特別選舉委員會開會、日籍委員安井源吾、父舊事事提、對於英美集團所用之「分散投票法」、大肆抨擊、日本之軸心國盟友德義兩國代表亦從而助長其氣熖、對英美法集團進攻、企圖能將舊有之選舉法取消、</p>
<p>日圖變更　選舉單位</p>
<p>工部局昨日所發表之特別市政公報、公佈發表該委員會混合報吿書全文、混合書大部份係記載日籍委員安井源吾之建議、安井源吾之建議、其理由如下、根據地皮章程之規定、任何商行或個人、皆不得有一票以上之選舉權、但「若干公司往往將其分成許多有名無實之所有人單位、藉此稱此類公司之財產、係雇員所公有、以增加選舉票之數目、」安井以爲此類有名無實之地主、不能認爲有資格之投票人、此項建議、附議者有德籍委員格萊德、及義籍委員福麥加里二人、反對者則有美籍委員卡納·英籍委員米契爾·及法籍委員沙華立三人、雙方各得三票、勢均力敵、該委員會在此情形下、唯有對安井源告之建議續加研究後、再行提出報告書、</p>
<p>目前情勢　不致變更</p>

<p>選舉人册　應予公佈</p>

<p>民十社會主義思想，已隨着蘇聯革命影響傳播到中國，我和熊先生鄺摩漢等即悉心從事，一方研究勞農政府的實際設施，一方探討馬克斯主義的眞諦。那時我們就組織了一個馬克斯主義研究會，熊先生早年所學的社會科學和日文，早已久置就荒，在那時纔又刻苦努力起來。他晚年在學術上的貢獻，主要是那時候打下的基礎。他和鄺摩漢等八九人曾一度加入最初發起組織的社會主義靑年團（S．Y．即C．Y．前身。）十一年一月我和熊先生鄺摩漢等組織共產主義同志會，出版各種刊物，熊先生所譯的哥達綱領批評和國際勞動同盟的歷史，都是有關勞動運動的重要文獻，而恩克斯的家族私有財產及國家之起源那一權威著作，也是由他首先介紹到中國來。</p>
<p>十一年秋天，瞿秋白從蘇聯回國，經他和劉子通斡旋介紹，我們都加入CP，把共產主義同志會解散，但不久我們又和CP的組織關係就斷絕了。此後他已逐漸由政治完全轉移到學術方面。</p>
<p>十四年我保荐陳鴻書任湖北敎育廳長，由熊先生和錢鐵如寗敦武鄧初民諸先生建議，推舉張懷九（知本）先生爲北湖法專校長，熊先生任敎授，此爲他從事敎育生活的開始。那時正是國民革命的高潮，他和錢寗兩先生住在武昌北城角，每天總有許多靑年到那裏找他們討論間題，他們也瘴精竭慮的從事指導，那寓所無形中成爲武漢革命靑年！滙集的處所，這是他對靑年們影鄉最深的一個時期。現在熊先生已歸道山，那些靑年也早已十之八九身殉革命了！北伐中武昌圍城之役，他們坐困範城，艱苦不堪，但仍冒着饑餓和生命危險，繼續指導革命靑年。</p>
<p>國民革命軍攻克武昌後，以武昌高等師範學校爲根幹，合併其他國省立高等專科學校，組爲大學（即武漢大學之前身），熊先生爲當時名敎授之一。直到十六年秋武漢政變，他不能在武昌存身，遂避居上海，不時爲各報章雜誌撰文，到十八年，他與李達·錢鐵如·寗敦武·張定夫·鄧初民·施存統等，開辦崑崙書店，有系統的介紹社會科學名著，熊先生專治社會史和經濟學，重要的著譯有中國社會史硏究，物觀經濟學史，馬克斯主義經淸學基礎理論等。民國二十年以後的中國社會史論戰，他也是參戰者之一，他所提供的兩篇論戰文字—中國農民問題之史的叙述與中國商業資本的發生之研究—也同樣是以矜審的科學態度，檢討中國社會的縱斷面。農民問題一文中關於中國物納地租停滯現象的解析，商業資本一文中根據馬克斯的見解以廓淸時人種種謬見，均具有過人的卓識。而一般參與論戰者那種武斷漫駡的通病，在他是絕對沒有的。</p>
<p>民國二十年起，他在打浦橋上海法政學院任敎授數年，二十四年廣四良豐師範專科學校聘爲敎授，講授中國通史，次年良師歸併於廣西大學，改爲文生學院，他仍繼續担任通史敎授。那一通史講義，算是他最後心血的結晶，也算是歷史書中少有的傑著，但是他只請到明季卽與世長逝了。聞現正由李　先生替他校勘作片，一俟李先生序言脫稿後，自由我和錢先生覆校付印，以竟他未了的初願。　（未完）</p>

<p>— 郭文牆</p>
<p>這兩天，不知為了甚麽比平日起來得早，這或許是被糞夫的尖銳叫醒了，再也睡不着的緣故。原來自從舊歷元旦起，糞夫「光臨」的時間改在早上六時半了。</p>
<p>「還是早些起來在街上跑跑吧。」主意一定，就照着實行了。剛跑出門口，走上大街，迎頭來了兩個菜販。</p>
<p>「唉，立春後，菜蔬吃不起苦頭，一碰太陽，它們就要皺得很難看。」菜販在說。</p>
<p>「是的。立春後本來就是春天了。」另一個菜販答着。</p>
<p>他們很快地走過了。</p>
<p>「春天到了，」「這樣和暖明朗的天氣，不就是春天嗎？」我放慢了脚步，輕輕地走着想着。</p>
<p>從淡水路直穿過去是　坡賽路，從　坡賽路　出去，就是霞飛路了。整齊的大樹，一棵棵直立在路的兩旁，經過了冬天，剩下　些殘葉及殘枝來。隔了一條馬路，遠遠地望見幾枝樹上爬着幾個人。他們幹嗎爬上樹？走近去一看，知道了，原來他們是來修樹的。這是公事呀。他們慢慢地將樹上的殘枝及殘葉，用了小型齒輪刀及大型的剪刀砍了下來，隨即用一些柏樹油，將被砍去而露出的新枝頭的地方，塗上了一層。聽說這是有兩個作用的：一是保護，二是使得新露出白枝頭的樹枝的顏色，與樹幹同色。</p>
<p>剛被砍下的樹枝，人們搶着用三元五角一担的代價購了去。</p>
<p>孩子們拾起地上的樹枝，你打我，我打他，他打你，大家在追逐着，閙着。</p>
<p>就在路旁轉灣的一個弄堂口，一個小三子在晒太陽，而且是在實行「實體日光浴」。倚在牆角邊，拿了從身上脫下的一件唯一的衣服，咇咇扑扑地在捉「小孫悟空」。</p>
<p>「小孫悟空」，我還是今天從小一子那邊學來的，因為我剛才聽見他說着：「小孫悟空，往那裏逃！」隨即，右手向嘴裏一塞，「小孫悟空」就進了「如來佛」的嘴。</p>
<p>春天真的到了嗎？是的，春天正向人間走來。</p>

<h3 id="c83">燈 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>燈漸漸明亮起來了。</p>
<p>這是一盞不大的燈，圓周不過一尺，而且多麽小凡呵！透明的琉璃罩赤裸裸地顯露出尖小的，木質的燭挿。它的製作者似乎吝嗇匠心，不願炫奇鬥巧，連半朶花卉，一筆顏色，也不給添抹。</p>
<p>但因此，這燃燒着細小的紅燭的燈卻放射着異樣的光輝了。</p>
<p>我提着那盞小燈，來去地跑着。我跑到那裏，那裏黑暗就迅速地向後退卻。於是，火光照耀了一切，撫慰了一切。</p>
<p>我彷彿覺得我就是那火，那光。</p>
<p>我把燈伸展到牀下。光輪也照亮了這陰暗的一隅。驀地，剝喙，——有什麽小動物打我的脚背溜過去。</p>
<p>一隻老鼠！</p>
<p>我會心地笑了。</p>
<p>我不知道人類開始點燈是在什麽時候。希臘人說普洛美修斯為了從天上偷火給人類，給鎖在高山上，永遠遭受老鷹的磨折。我們不僅得熟食，還可以點燈了。有了燈，我們不用再在暗眛的無知中摸索，人生變得煥發起來，再不渾渾噩噩，缺乏光彩。燈予人類的進步以怎樣出色的幫助呵！</p>
<p>自然，憎惡燈的可也不少。這鼷鼠就是其中之一。那是因為燈揭穿了它的偷偷摸摸的勾當。假使它會使用暴力，它要撲滅這盞燈的。</p>
<p>我緊緊地護着這盞燈。望着它，是有趣的。先是一點火苗，漸漸地絢爛起來了。那青色的燄平和然而欣欣地舒伸着，像要席捲周圍的一切黑暗。而這紅燭的整個生命的存在，似乎就只為了生熱，發光，……即使在最後的一剎那，它還爆出燦爛的火花，啟示了不斷的掙扎和搏鬥！</p>
<p>請高　起你們的燈吧。它們將如千萬星星照澈夜空，為了人們對於夜，黑暗，是那麽陌生，不習慣！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>當別的來賓被邀請上去演講的時候，袁寶藩的一對眸子，便在那些女學生的臉上轉得更上勁了，及至來賓演說完畢，汪省長把幾十張畢業文憑散發掉，他也把每一個比較動人的少女的臉龐認熟了。正當他在運用着他那勇於為惡的腦神經，打算思索出一個可以立刻滿足他慾望的邪念的時候，忽聽那站在角上的老頭兒，用着沙啞的嗓子高喊道：「學生代表致謝詞」，接着便從第七排上轉出了一個長身玉立，不施脂粉的女學生來。</p>
<p>羅湘綺的身子還沒有在講台上站定，袁鎮宋使的知覺已有一半麻木了；假使胡督軍的動作遲鈍一些，不先用臂肘向他撞一下，警告他萬勿有舉動的話，他就至少會利用他那天賦佳喉，痛痛快快的喊出一聲好起來了。因為對於他，學堂和戲館是沒有什麽分別的！</p>
<p>在事前，羅湘綺已把一段謝詞預備好了，走上講台，便把一方白紙捧在手裏，用着很清脆的聲音，慢慢地朗誦起來。</p>
<p>像銀鈴一般的聲音，一下一下的打在袁寶藩的耳鼓上，使他從心底裏覺得癢起來；他的眸子一動不動的看定了羅湘綺的面部；烏黑的頭髪，挺直的鼻子，發光的眼睛，微紅的嘴唇，白中帶黃，彷彿象牙所琢成的膚色，都像磁石一樣的牢牢地吸住了他的心靈。但在一切的中間，却絲毫沒有他所常見的妖艷的成分，只像一朶供在佛座前尙未開放的蓮花。</p>
<p>「好三哥，我是不識字的，快給我看一看這姑娘叫什麽名字！」袁寶藩急得來不及的湊在胡督軍的耳朶連問。</p>
<p>「她身上又不寫什麽名字，叫我打那裏去看啊？」被問的人立刻把他駁回了。</p>
<p>「那一張單子上少不得她的名字寫着吧？」袁鎮守使把墻上貼的一張秩序單，當做了戲館裏的水牌，便把手指了一指，重復向胡督軍問。（二八）</p>
<h3 id="c85">新城隍廟內 <a href="#c85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— 雨亭</p>
<p>一堆一堆的人頭往邑廟門裏亂鑽，合成了像潮水般的人羣。擁擠，蠕動，喧嚷同以前的城隍廟找不出不同。</p>
<p>大殿上擁滿了善男子與善女人，焚香點燭的通神祝拜。他們與她們這時候共有一顆相類自私的心，就是求得菩薩的保佑。一陣陣的熱氣從殿內傳出來，在殿連就像站在火爐旁一樣，無怪這幾天城隍菩薩的臉色格外紅潤了。</p>
<p>點心店講明的椅凳都坐滿了人，吃客談着笑着，一面　留意到店外的熱鬧。一批未走另一批已預備搶座了。生意的忙碌使堂倌感覺到手足無措，忙不過來是真傢伙的。</p>
<p>各色各樣的燈，爭艷競奇的懸掛在舖內，連走巷也掛滿了紅的綠的，互博遊客的青睞。玲瓏的玩具陳列在攤上和玻璃櫉裏，種類的多，更不得不藉繩子的吊懸，儘量的爭取人家的注意。孩子們經過了賣玩具的店門，戀戀不捨的徘徊着，吵得要買。直至手中拿到了一二件，方才邊跳邊玩的走了；否則就翹了嘴皮，也有拖了眼淚的，這完全看大人騙孩子的本領了。</p>
<p>賣假首飾，也是邑廟市塲的特徵。單講價值兩角一隻的戒指，鑲式的多就够你燿目了。技巧的佳幾乎亂真，有翡翠的，瑪瑙的，鑽的……可惜都是假的。幾排的主顧站在店前，挑選的挑選，試帶的試帶，好奇心與貪便宜牽出了囊中的錢幣。</p>
<p>地方比老城隍廟小得多了，很快的就兜了一個圈子。外面的遊人還是不斷的擠進來。熱鬧引誘人使不願離開他，繁榮佔了每個人的心。魷魚，玩具，戒指還像磁石一樣的把藏在袋中的錢吸了出來。有誰曾辨一辨這些東西是甚麽貨色呢？有誰再想想到廟外飢餓綫上的人們呢？</p>
<p>走出廟門口，三四個年少的街頭流浪者，真人疊人的想取得飛在廟門廊簷下的氫氣球，一個瘦小的向前一冲，大家跌在一堆。</p>
<p>「兩角一隻啦！」連連的黏在他們的嘴上，跌痛和危險在他們倒是小事。</p>

<h3 id="c87">「屏開雀選」 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 桑民</p>
<p>本劇原名「傲慢與偏見Pride　and　Prejudice」，爲一抒寫人情的故事，倘觀者能靜心領略，自不失爲相當優秀的作品。劇本由小說改編而來，導演者李奧納特向以包辦珍妮麥唐娜和納爾遜愛迪合演的片子爲能事。惟其中除「戰地笙歌」以外，還沒有甚麽孚衆望入人心的戲可說。</p>
<p>題旨諷刺有餘，而魄力不足，英國紳士的幽默，無法要求它有甚麼澈底的意義。故事開展在英國封逮社會，講求門第之見的舊家庭中，裴納太太和裴納先生領着五個待嫁的女兒急於攀婚貴族子弟。經過一番輕趣的微瀾後，個個嫁得金龜妙婿。</p>
<p>人物着重在葛麗亞嘉蓀飾的長女依利莎白和勞倫斯奧立佛所飾的貴族少年陶賽身上，一個有着貴族的傲慢氣息，一個存着怨恨報復的偏見，終能捐除傲慢與偏見，而見到心底的愛。不過這愛還是建築在紳士制度上，如斥資成人之美一段，對於愛的解說，較之美國人的見解，不如遠甚。</p>
<p>兩主角都是典型的優秀演員，嘉蓀長於淑媚，奧立佛則有剛勁之氣，對劇中人性格把握得牢，自是意中事。餘如愛鬥高文之裴納先生，曼麗鮑倫之裴納太太，安娜梅奧立佛之貴婦剴莎琳，瑪蓮奧莎莉文之次女瓊都演得很好。</p>
<p>導演劇本都從人情味上發揮，對貴族社會封建社會的不合理，止於諷刺，並無否定之意。手法相當細膩，小處着眼，自是人情戲不可免的作法。本片作得不錯。至少較之同一導演的近作「新月」，俱見功夫。</p>

<p>「正心，誠意，修身，齊家，治國，平天下。忠孝仁愛，信義和平，乃大丈夫立身之本。」在二千年前室正確的，二千年後的今日，仍然地正確；推出億萬勘年，愈見此眞理的輝煌！夫子講仁義，主和平，乃世人共知；但是那除暴鋤奸，扶弱小，反侵略，至死而不屈的戰鬥精神，仍爲一般人所忽略，實須有新認識的必要。</p>
<p>和平並非可安享苟得，也非徒事　解所能致果，必須具有不妥協，不屈服，以戰求和的決心，然後始能謀取真正的和平。夫子固然不好戰，但亦不畏戰，他更力倡殺身成仁，捨生取義的正義戰。仁愛是目的，智勇是手段，世　少數的殘暴者，是和平的魔障，是人類的公仇，也是夫子的大敵！</p>
<p>瞧罷！他畢生的言行，處處爲正義人道而搏鬥。周遊列國，踏上萬里征途，與亂臣賊子爭。述「論語」，作「春秋」，對殘忍得敵人，口誅筆伐而不休；臨終尤諄告誠未死地弟子「予死後，有爾等；爾等死後，還有千千萬萬的後代」，一字一淚，撼動了每個黃帝後裔的心靈！</p>
<p>你聽，他唱的：「茫茫山野兮草枯黃，奔走四方兮宿寒荒，誅盡奸亂兮逐豺狼。」氣概之盛，意志之堅，有誰能否認他不是黑暗中的鬥士？所以儒家的眞精神，不在靜靜的硏究方面，而在動的實踐覜。習「四書」，講「五經」，執筆而嫻熟乎夫子之學，談吐間盡屬先聖賢哲之道，潔身自好者，這祇是認識消極的一面；有能化夫子的言論爲行動，堅守忠貞爲國的志操，繼承其扶弱除暴的精神，道才配稱新中國儒家的信徒，才是中國所需要的新靑年。記住：夫子不是文弱的書生，不是空談的學者，更小是一般所想像中迂腐偶像；他是有計劃的實行家，是偉大的愛國者，更是反侵略的急先鋒！</p>
<p>如果有人說，中國缺乏固有的宗敎，那無疑地，夫子便是我們偉大的敎主。爭取祖國的自由與獨立，便是我們所遵守勵行的敎義。夫子與基督，釋迦同樣是世界愛護和平人類的救主。我們今日的反侵略戰，其冥中已秉承着夫子的遺訓，在東南邊境上，在北地寒荒中，我們有着千　萬萬的子路，馳騁疆塲，灑熱血，拋頭顱，踏着先烈血跡，誓死而平屆，我中華民族的所以小亡，文化听以不朽，其在斯乎！其在斯乎！</p>
<p>我們劉於夫子有了正確的新認識，更能堅强我們除暴鋤奸的信念。信念生力是合四萬萬個的新認識與新信念，這無匹的偉力，必能推動新中國走上光明的大路！</p>

<p>Chongqing – General Bai Chongxi, Deputy Chief of Staff, reported today on the details of the recent battle in southern Henan, stating that in the past two weeks, the Japanese army's offensive in Henan and Hubei provinces has focused its main attack on Henan, with only minor battles seen in Hubei. Before the offensive in Henan, the Japanese forces stationed there included the 18th Independent Brigade, the 39th Division, the 4th Division, the 3rd Division, the 14th Independent Brigade, and other troops, totaling three and a half divisions, including 80,000 infantry, 8,000 cavalry, 550 field guns, 500 tanks, and 200 armored vehicles. In mid-January, the Japanese launched an offensive on the west bank of the Han River, aiming to lure Chinese forces into the area. By January 24, the main Japanese force launched an offensive in southern Henan. Last December, the Japanese secretly transferred the 17th and 15th Divisions to southern Henan and northern Hubei, while a portion of the 40th Division moved from southern Henan to Xinyang, where 30,000 Japanese troops were concentrated in mid-January.

<p>Chongqing – Yesterday, a Chinese military communique stated that in the battles in Henan and western Anhui, Chinese forces had achieved successful victories. Chinese forces have recovered Woyang, forty miles northeast of Taihe in Henan and Anhui, which had been occupied by the Japanese during their large-scale offensive in Henan. After several hard-fought battles on the Pinghan Railway, Chinese forces have pushed the Japanese troops in Xinyang twenty-four miles south. In Tongbai, forty miles northwest of Xinyang, a large number of Japanese troops west of the railway were captured by Chinese forces. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – The Ta Kung Pao recently published an editorial on the matter of promoting wartime bonds, calling on the people of the country to arouse their patriotism, economize all their financial resources, and purchase national bonds, and offering two suggestions to the government: (1) Exchange bonds for escaped overseas capital. A considerable amount of foreign currency is deposited by Chinese people in American and British banks. If negotiations are made with Britain and the United States to extradite the deposits, it can definitely be done, and bond certificates can be given to the depositors. (2) Adopt a system of allocation. It is said that allocating bonds has become a necessary step for the current financial situation. It not only raises funds but also suppresses prices and curbs inflation. Therefore, it is a fair and effective financial strategy to impose an appropriate allocation on those who enjoy excessive profits or possess wealthy assets. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Analysis of the World Situation <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>With the passage of the American "Lend-Lease Act" in the House of Representatives, the Senate will surely pass it smoothly as well. From this point on, the international situation will undergo major developments, which everyone is currently holding their breath to expect.</p>
<p>Analyzing the international situation: Strictly speaking, from a diplomatic perspective, the formal announcement of the Tripartite Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan last September fundamentally blocked their diplomatic initiative and maneuverability in one fell swoop. As a result, the three countries were left with only military and strategic initiative. According to this pact, although they have the freedom to take any actions they deem necessary and can attack in any direction, after exposing the faces of the "New Order" builders, what diplomatic maneuverability do they have with any other country outside the three countries? Only demanding or coercing recognition of their "New Order." Beyond that, there is no more diplomacy. Over the past four months, the various diplomatic activities of Germany and Italy in Europe, as well as Japan's various postures toward Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, have all been focused on obtaining recognition or understanding from other countries regarding the "New Order." In the past, present, and future, these will certainly have no effect. Because their fundamental basis is pure violence, what is most noteworthy is how they will ultimately use their offensive and which target they will apply violence to first. When Japan invaded Vietnam, what everyone expected was not a northward advance to attack Yunnan and Guangxi in China, but the implementation of the so-called "Southern Advance." When Germany invaded Romania, Italy attacked Greece, and simultaneously used troops in Africa, what everyone was worried about first was the fate of the Balkan countries and Turkey, and secondly, Britain's defense in the Mediterranean and Red Seas, in Africa, and in the Middle East and Near East.</p>
<p>If the three countries' offensives could truly succeed, then countries like China, Britain, and the United States, which oppose the "New Order," would have to remain in a defensive position, each striving to individually resist the advance of the three countries. However, in reality, this is not the case. This is because at the same time that Italy has suffered major setbacks in both Europe and Africa, Japan in Asia has also fallen into a predicament where both northward and southward advances are impossible due to the unexpectedly strong stance of the United States. Under this situation, China, Britain, and the United States are given a great opportunity to change from a defensive military posture to an offensive one, from being passive to actively seeking the initiative. The American "Lend-Lease Act" is the prelude to this move, and Britain's recent large-scale attacks on Italy are already the beginning of the offensive.</p>
<p>The various aspects of the American government and public opinion regarding the "Lend-Lease Act" have been clarified very clearly. Its greatest significance is to thoroughly defeat Germany, Italy, and Japan. British Prime Minister Churchill's speech the day before yesterday also stated a plan to defeat Italy first and then defeat Germany to achieve final victory. The Chinese authorities recently emphasized their determination to counterattack when contacting the United States for assistance. Therefore, looking at it from this perspective, the most core content of the various measures taken by China, Britain, and the United States in the future is to concentrate on working together to defeat Germany, Italy, and Japan separately. As for Germany, Italy, and Japan, if they do not abandon the so-called "New Order," then all their current measures must be centered on two of the most urgent tasks: (1) how to prevent the actual effect of American assistance to various democratic countries; (2) how to save Italy from its impending doom. These two aspects constitute the main trend of the evolution of the entire international situation at present and in the near future.</p>
<p>Regarding cooperation between China, Britain, and the United States, after the passage of the "Lend-Lease Act," the United States will first import a large number of aircraft into the British Isles, allowing Britain, in addition to attacking Italy, to have sufficient aircraft to defend its own skies and protect the fleet preventing the German army from crossing the sea. Once the British air force balances with or even exceeds the German air force, Germany will lose the advantage of the only weapon it relies on to invade the British Isles, and the battle situation in Britain itself can be absolutely stabilized. As for China, once it possesses a large number of aircraft, one of the most important conditions for a large-scale counterattack will have been completed. In terms of the navy, the American two-ocean fleet program will of course be actively accelerated. Once its Pacific Fleet is fully concentrated in various bases and cooperates with the British fleet in the South Pacific, the Japanese fleet will fall into a solid encirclement. Not only will it be impossible to assist Germany and Italy in their operations in Europe and Africa, and the southern advance will be impossible, but even protecting its own overseas commercial expansion will be completely impossible. As for the Italian fleet, it can now avoid fighting the British fleet and temporarily gain a respite. At that time, after the United States adds a large number of warships to the British fleet, the Italian navy will have to risk a battle in an attempt to break through the encirclement, but this is bound to fail. After Britain and the United States completely control the sea, Germany, Italy, and Japan will fall into an unprecedented blockade, and then be forced to surrender and await the final collapse. This so-called collapse does not necessarily require suffering a counterattack, but the momentum of the counterattack by China and Britain with new forces at that time will certainly be unstoppable by the three countries.</p>
<p>Looking again at Germany, Italy, and Japan preventing American aid to various democratic countries, the various intimidation and sabotage activities they have done during these times have been declared a complete failure in principle by the passage of this "Lend-Lease Act." In the future, they can only rely on actual actions: how to make it impossible for China and Britain to receive aid, and how to make it impossible for the United States to automatically go to the aid of various countries. The only way to take this action is to preemptively defeat the various invaded countries, so that they are defeated before they can receive American aid; otherwise, the only way is to directly attack the United States. In addition, how to save Italy from its impending doom should also be considered a top priority by Germany and Japan. Estimating all possible routes, it is impossible for the German army to go through Bulgaria in the Balkan Peninsula to support Italy and disturb the Mediterranean because of the resolute attitudes of the Soviet Union and Turkey. The only remaining method is to go through Yugoslavia, or for the German air force to provide air support to Italy. This is now being intensified, but as a result, it has also dispersed the strength of the attack on Britain. The result of this will not affect the total combat power of both sides, but if the joint German and Italian air force can weaken British hegemony in the Mediterranean, then perhaps they can attempt to send the German army to Africa to assist Italy in its operations. However, the most effective third way to save Italy is for Germany to directly attack Britain, or for Japan to attack British territories in the East, diverting Britain's strength and attention.</p>
<p>However, looking at the recent international situation, even in terms of military initiative, it is being transferred to the hands of countries such as China, Britain, and the United States day by day. Therefore, in the near future, if Germany, Italy, and Japan cannot make any amazing moves, then they will fall into losing all initiative and all hope of winning.</p>

<p>Vichy – According to sources here, General Franco has entered French territory and will transfer to Italy to meet with Mussolini. (Haitong dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Vichy – Confirmed reports state that Spanish leader General Franco and Spanish Foreign Minister Sunar passed through French territory today. It is expected that they will travel to Italy to discuss matters with Mussolini or Hitler. It is also reported that on their return trip, they will meet with Marshal Petain in the Riviera on Thursday. Petain left for the Riviera by special train today. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Vichy – The visit of Spanish dictator Franco, who passed through French territory yesterday on his way to Rome, has sparked rumors that Spain will mediate the Anglo-Italian conflict. Informed sources here predict that Marshal Petain, the French Prime Minister who once served as the French Ambassador to Spain, has maintained close contact with Franco recently. In the near future, if the Anglo-Italian conflict is mediated, Petain may suggest an important step. Diplomatic circles here say that although the Italian army was defeated in Libya, the Italian press maintains a "strange silence," which is quite puzzling. The influence of the United States has also been speculated by diplomatic circles. It is pointed out that the United States recently agreed to provide food relief to starving Spanish people. In return, Franco may attempt to mediate. Observers here say that President Roosevelt has repeatedly asked Mussolini through diplomats and special envoys to extricate Italy from the quagmire of war. The US government recently received secret reports that there is unrest everywhere in Italy, and in the near future, "events may occur." (International News Service, 11th)</p>

<p>New York: A "New York Times" correspondent stationed in Vichy reports that, according to reliable sources in Vichy, there is a possibility that Spanish General Franco will meet with Mussolini in Italy, and that Hitler will also have an opportunity to participate. It is reported that General Petain is currently at his villa near Cannes, taking a few days of rest. The newspaper points out that General Petain served as ambassador to Spain and is highly respected by Mr. Franco, leading to speculation that Mr. Franco may be acting as a mediator, and that some negotiations have begun between England and Italy. According to previous news from Vichy, Mr. Franco had set off for Rome, leading to rumors that he might be acting as an intermediary to mediate between England and Italy.

<p>Vichy: It is widely rumored here that Spanish Head of State General Franco has received an invitation from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to meet in a certain location in Italy. At that time, Mr. Franco also plans to lead Foreign Minister Serrano Suñer to travel through France. Foreign Minister Suñer will also come here to visit the French authorities. According to observations from diplomatic circles here, this news has not yet been confirmed. If it does materialize, it is likely due to the chaotic situation in the Mediterranean. The development of the war situation in Italian Libya in North Africa has directly affected the Mediterranean situation. Since Spain and Italy are two major peninsulas extending into the Mediterranean, their respective authorities must have the need for long-term planning. It is reported that since Foreign Minister Suñer's visit to Berlin and Rome at the end of last year, Spain's position has not changed. (Tenth Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>London: As Britain severed relations with Romania, the world's attention yesterday focused on the Balkans, as it may be the location where the next war will break out. It is reported that Romania's neighbors are now fervently preparing for war, as it is widely believed that such a war is very possible as a result of British diplomatic actions. News reports state that convoys of armored vehicles carrying thousands of German troops in plain clothes are passing through Romania en route to Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. It is also reported that 500,000 German troops are concentrating on the Hungarian border, preparing to enter Romania. Within Romania, large-scale military operations are reportedly underway after Prime Minister Antonescu ordered the implementation of the first national blackout yesterday. (Eleventh International News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Since the severance of Anglo-Romanian diplomatic relations, authoritative sources here today are maintaining silence regarding the actions that Britain will take against Romania. However, the official British news agency stated today that if Germany uses Romanian oil fields to invade England, it will immediately trigger bombing by British aircraft. Therefore, Balkan diplomatic circles believe that Britain's second step may be to bomb the Ploiești oil fields in Romania without provocation. (Eleventh International News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Observers today believe that the severance of Anglo-Romanian diplomatic relations, following British Prime Minister Churchill's stern warning to Bulgaria, indicates that the Balkan situation may soon erupt. Balkan diplomats say that if Romania soon goes to war with Britain and Bulgaria colludes with Germany to join Romania in fighting against Britain, it is entirely within their expectations. They believe that if Britain bombs Romanian oil fields, it will be followed by a formal declaration of war. There is no sign of such a situation being imminent, but given Britain's statement that Romania is being used by Germany as a basis for military plans, this matter is difficult to ignore. It was recently rumored that Germany has established a large military base in the Dobruja province of Bulgaria, including the storage of large quantities of munitions. It is widely believed that British Prime Minister Churchill's warning to Bulgaria was prompted by this direct factor. British Prime Minister Churchill reportedly knew of the activities of German plainclothes officers and pilots at airfields in Bulgaria. (Eleventh United Press International dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, 400,000 to 500,000 German troops are now concentrated in Romania or on the Slovak border, awaiting orders to enter Romania.

However, news has come that the number of German "tourists" entering Bulgaria has been increasing daily. Regarding the rumors that German troops have entered Bulgaria and that Bulgarian airfields have been occupied by Germany, the Bulgarian official news agency officially issued a denial at midnight yesterday. The original text is as follows: "Regarding the statement made by the British Prime Minister in his broadcast on February 9 that German troops have entered Bulgaria and occupied Bulgarian airfields, the Bulgarian Telegraph Agency has been ordered to declare that this statement is not in accordance with the facts. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that there is no doubt that German troops are concentrated in Romania. However, the claim that trains full of German troops have arrived in Sofia must be taken with reservation, as there is no direct rail connection between Romania and Bulgaria, and there are no bridges across the Danube River on the common border between the two countries. Moreover, the Danube River is now frozen, with ice accumulating, making it extremely difficult for vehicles to pass. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>

A senior diplomat in Sofia estimates their number to be several thousand. Germans are now rapidly taking over the supervision of airfields. It is believed that some German anti-aircraft batteries have recently been deployed, and German trucks are traveling on the roads. Schools in several areas have been closed. Bulgarian troops are now concentrated in the south and southeast. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Bulgaria in Critical Situation Authorities Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>London: A Free French news agency correspondent in Istanbul reports that diplomatic circles in Sofia now believe that the German invasion of Bulgaria is imminent. A Bulgarian cabinet meeting was held last night, and the Bulgarian king has departed from Sofia to his palace in Tekirvo, 60 miles south of the capital. According to a "Times" diplomatic correspondent, some sources believe that the Germans will occupy a part of Bulgaria, including the area from the capital to the Greek border. At that time, they will demand that Greece make concessions to Italy and stop the war, hoping that Greece will succumb. As for Germany, it can apply the same pressure to Turkey. News from various locations along the Danube River states that Germany is concentrating troops and military supplies in Romania. According to a "Times" correspondent in Istanbul, reliable sources say that the number of German troops concentrated has reached 20 divisions. A "Daily Telegraph" correspondent in the Yugoslav capital said that leaders of various opposition parties in Bulgaria have notified Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov, telling him that the entire country does not want and is not prepared to join any form of military action, and warning him not to sever relations with Western European powers.

<p>Ankara: Turkish people express doubts about whether the British Prime Minister's speech mentioning Bulgaria will have much impact on that country. It is said that it is not easy for German troops to invade the Balkans under the resistance of 30 divisions of South troops, 50 divisions of Turkish troops, some Bulgarian troops, and the British navy and air force. However, it is believed that Bulgaria's attitude will be influenced by the demands of domestic reformers, especially to obtain an outlet in the Aegean Sea. Some Turkish observers believe that the Balkan alliance backed by Britain will not only encounter German opposition, but the Soviet Union may also oppose it. At present, there is no sign that the Soviet Union is prepared to provide assistance when the South and Bulgaria are invaded by Germany. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Bucharest: The British announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations with Romania has long been expected by the general public here. Since the entry of German troops into Romania and Romania's joining of the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan, the relations between Britain and Romania have been tenuous. However, it is not without strangeness that Britain suddenly announced the severance of relations at this time. British Minister Sir Reginald Hoare has requested the Romanian government to issue passports, preparing to lead the entire staff to lower the flag and return home on the 15th of this month.

<p>London: Official circles in London, speaking of Britain's recall of its envoy, said that German troops had been arriving in Romania in batches for several months, with a small number of people in each batch. At that time, the Romanian government told the British envoy that the arrival of German troops was intended to train the Romanian army in new tactics. However, it later developed into the German headquarters creating various foundations for the expeditionary force in Romania, and stockpiling large quantities of munitions and fuel in various important locations. It is clear that Germany is using Romania as its military base to develop its operational plans. The Romanian government has never objected to this action. The British Embassy is in an impossible position in this environment. The British government has instructed the resident envoy to withdraw the staff of the embassy and consulates, which will be realized within a few days. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: After the severance of diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania, diplomatic circles here are all in a state of calm, saying that this was expected. The motive for Britain's action is that the Romanian authorities arrested a British consul, detained him for ten days, and handed him over to the German authorities. Although the consul was later released, Britain believes that this matter is of great significance. Since German troops are stationed in Romania, British envoys and personnel stationed in the country will no longer be safe. On the other hand, the severance of Anglo-Romanian relations can also be regarded as the result of the recent development of the situation in Southeastern Europe, and its role is to deal with Bulgaria, more so than to deal with Romania. In other words, this British action is primarily to warn Bulgaria that if it allows German troops to enter the country, Britain will also sever diplomatic relations with it. Although this Anglo-Romanian severance of diplomatic relations will not have any immediate impact, if the situation in Bulgaria changes in the future, it may produce certain consequences.

<p>Washington: Yesterday's news here stated that the newly appointed American Ambassador to Britain, entrusted by President Roosevelt, is charged with an important mission to shift the eyes of British leaders to focus on a sound policy of permanent peace after the war. Government sources revealed that this plan hopes to establish an international human society based on democracy in the economic and political fields. According to the plan, whether defeated or victorious, all must receive fair treatment in society and have a solid foundation in the economy. It is reported that the State Department has already conducted experimental research in drafting this plan. This completed proposal is what the United States wants to use to replace the dictatorship in the new world order. According to the proposal, all nations participating in the international community will enjoy economic stability, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech. The plan also anticipates extensive public works programs in both defeated and victorious countries to address the unemployment problem after the demobilization of troops. The proposal also predicts that Secretary of State Hull's reciprocal trade program will be restored on an international scale. According to this plan, all colonies around the world will be developed through international cooperation. President Roosevelt knew that Winant could do the job, so he appointed Winant as Ambassador to the United Kingdom to shift the eyes of British leaders to this plan. Winant is known for his freedom and has advanced ideas on the world economy. Before the United States withdrew from the League of Nations, Winant was the director of the American Labor Group of the League of Nations. (Eleventh International News Service dispatch)</p>

<p>London: A Reuters Air Force correspondent said that the British authorities' national defense plans also take into account the possibility of the Axis air force using poison gas. Therefore, steps have now been taken to guard against this threat. Britain, in accordance with the 1925 Geneva Protocol, has guaranteed that it will not use poison gas unless the enemy uses it first. Therefore, if poison gas does appear, it must be Germany who uses it first. Germany used this weapon first in the last war and later guaranteed that it would not use it again. However, its ally Italy used poison gas during the conquest of Abyssinia. The Axis countries may follow this precedent. It is widely believed that Germany has no new poison gas, and what can be called new is the previously unforeseen method of using poison gas. It is widely believed that the use of poison gas to terrorize civilians will probably not happen. (Eleventh Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Cairo – It is announced here that British forces have occupied Mausa Teccles, a small village on the Red Sea coast, 40 miles from the border between Eritrea and Sudan. British forces have also announced the occupation of Karora, a small town 40 miles inside the Eritrean border.

<p>Cairo – The mopping-up of Benghazi is "proceeding smoothly," while the British vanguard has advanced 200 miles towards Tripoli. Large formations of British aircraft are continuously bombing Tripoli, especially the naval base there, where aircraft, hangars, and railways have been heavily damaged. (International dispatch of the 11th)</p>
<p>London – The British Navy recently shelled the coast of Eritrea. This action by the British Navy is a harbinger of a new offensive launched by British forces on the northern coastal plain. Military observers believe that since the British forces have been very successful in attacking Graziani's forces in Libya, this type of warfare will certainly also be applied to Eritrea. The British forces advancing from the north are now in a position to cut off the escape route of 15,000 Italian troops defending Keren. Another British force is already attacking these Italian troops. The British advance from the north appears to be a large-scale encirclement of the Italian forces.

Robotti has previously served as Deputy Governor of Somalia, Governor of Abyssinia, and Minister of Colonies. He is renowned for his bravery in combat, especially during the World War, so the newspapers have praised him, saying that Robotti's appointment as Deputy Governor of Libya at this critical time will certainly assist General Graziani in military affairs.

<p>Washington – Yesterday, attention here was focused on a mysterious shooting in a Washington hotel. The victim was identified as Krivitsky, the former chief of the Soviet secret police in Western Europe. Krivitsky recently told the New Deal Committee that he wanted to expose the activities of the Fifth Column in the United States. It is generally known that Krivitsky had presented evidence against Communist activities in the U.S. and those opposed to the U.S. government. It cannot be determined whether the shooting was a suicide or murder. However, federal police officers believe that Krivitsky's death was a political revenge. Krivitsky had recently written several articles for the Saturday Evening Post exposing the Soviet secret police situation in France and the United States. Krivitsky claimed that he knew all the branches of the Soviet secret police. A certain far-left newspaper in the United States attempted to declare Krivitsky's writings as nothing but deception, but this attempt was unsuccessful. In his articles published in the Saturday Evening Post, Krivitsky was the first to predict the German-Soviet pact. Krivitsky also revealed that Germany is currently mass-producing counterfeit U.S. currency. (International News Service dispatch of the 11th)</p>

<p>Moscow – After months of preparation, Moscow recently built the world's first stereoscopic cinema. Viewers no longer need to use stereoscopic lenses. In the six days since its opening, it has attracted 30,000 viewers. According to the inventor, Ivanov, "I am very satisfied with the performance, and the audience's response is good. It can be said that it has been a success." Another scientist, Avanba, said, "This kind of undertaking should be expanded, and I am very impressed by it." The construction of the screen in the stereoscopic cinema is different from ordinary screens. Due to the effect of the stereoscopic lens, viewers can see the singers walk out of the screen, as if they were in the same place. At the same time, viewers feel that tree branches and flowers are close at hand, and the surging tide seems to be rushing towards them. (TASS dispatch of the 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Municipal Council Election Should Be Based on Land Regulations, Japan Attempts to Disrupt the Longstanding Electoral System, Britain Believes It Exceeds Council Authority <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>This year's Municipal Council election is based on Article 18 of the Land Regulations of the Shanghai International Settlement, and is conducted according to the system and methods that have remained unchanged since 1869. Maintaining the ratio of five British, two American, and two Japanese seats, it is expected that the United Front adopted by the British and American communities will continue to be victorious, and Japan's attempt to change the status quo of the settlement will ultimately fail. However, it was discovered in yesterday's Municipal Council Gazette that Japan intends to disrupt the electoral system and methods that have been used for many years, and suggests implementing a one-person, one-vote system to defeat the opposing side. The development of this action will certainly be valued by all Chinese and foreign citizens in Shanghai. Therefore, the Municipal Council's Special Election Committee held a meeting, where the Japanese member, Yasui Gengo, repeatedly brought up old matters, and strongly criticized the "dispersed voting method" used by the British and American groups. The representatives of Japan's Axis allies, Germany and Italy, also added fuel to the fire, attacking the British, American, and French groups, attempting to cancel the old election law.</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt to Change the Electoral Unit</p>
<p>The Special Municipal Gazette published by the Municipal Council yesterday published the full text of the committee's mixed report. The majority of the mixed report records the suggestions of the Japanese member Yasui Gengo. The reasons for Yasui Gengo's suggestions are as follows: According to the provisions of the Land Regulations, no commercial firm or individual may have more than one vote. However, "some companies often divide themselves into many nominal owner units, claiming that the property of such companies is jointly owned by employees, in order to increase the number of votes." Yasui believes that such nominal landowners should not be considered qualified voters. This suggestion was seconded by the German member, Greider, and the Italian member, Fomica Gali. The opponents were the American member, Carna, the British member, Mitchell, and the French member, Shavali. The two sides each had three votes, an equal number. Under these circumstances, the committee can only add further research to Yasui Gengo's suggestions before submitting another report.</p>
<p>The Current Situation Will Not Change</p>
<p>The reason for opposing the current election law is that the Municipal Council cannot ask the landowner to explain that he is a genuine landowner except to ask the landowner to show the deed issued by the consulate. Although the report does not state whether the committee can make any decisions on the issue of amending the election law in this election, well-informed sources do not believe that there is a possibility of immediate change in the final period of the election law.</p>
<p>Electoral Rolls Should Be Published</p>
<p>Although the opinions of the Special Election Committee are not consistent in this regard, they have reached a consensus in other areas. The committee made the following recommendations to the Municipal Council: (1) Appoint five foreign members to form a committee to review applications to vote and report their opinions to the Municipal Council. (2) The committee recommends to the Municipal Council that the electoral roll be published immediately after the end of the voting application so that people who are not on the electoral roll (except for those with omissions and errors in their names) cannot participate in the election. The final electoral roll should be distributed in the same way as the preliminary electoral roll. (3) The committee "strongly recommends" that the Municipal Council should notify the consular corps that, for the benefit of all parties, it should end the acceptance of voting applications one month before the first day of the election. After that date, all applications will be invalid. (4) The preliminary electoral roll should be compiled as soon as possible after December 1 each year, six weeks before the election date, posted in the Municipal Council Building, and distributed to the consulates, foreign communities, and general associations, and announced in the newspapers for public knowledge.</p>
<p>Voting Procedures Must Be Strict</p>
<p>(5) The committee also recommended to the Municipal Council that the following "minor modifications" be adopted in the election procedure: (a) Copies of voting passes are only valid at the designated polling place. (b) The number of ballot boxes at each polling place should not be limited to one, but should be increased according to the number of votes. (c) It is stipulated that the ballots should be sent to the tellers immediately after the end of the first day of the election, without delay. (d) It is stipulated that after the end of each day's election, the openings of the ballot boxes should be sealed in front of the tellers.</p>
<p>Britain Refutes Based on Legal Principles</p>
<p>Mitchell expressed opposition to Yasui's suggestion, saying, "This move is inconsistent with the current legal arguments and exceeds the scope of the Municipal Council's powers. The Land Regulations are the constitution of the International Settlement, and the Municipal Council has no power to modify them or deviate from the norm. The Municipal Council has no other way but to add the names of landowners to the electoral list. The detailed circumstances of the landowner are irrelevant to the Municipal Council. If the Municipal Council convenes the foreign consulate to prove that they are the landowner or the person who purchased the land, and conducts a detailed investigation of the relationship with their land, the landowner has the right to refuse this request, but the landowner's right to vote will not disappear as a result."</p>
<p>Fan Ke Ling Appointed Chairman</p>
<p>The committee was established yesterday afternoon in the Municipal Council Building and held its first meeting, electing Fan Ke Ling as chairman. In order to facilitate the advancement of the committee's work, it was also legally added that a representative of the Land Industry Association would be a member of the committee. The research on the issue of unfair tax system will be scheduled for the second meeting this Friday (14th) to continue the discussion.</p>

<p>The Western Shanghai Joint District Police Force is still being organized. It is heard that the Public Concession authorities are now planning to make a recommendation to promote Inspector Hall as the head of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Department, and Superintendent Blandinksopp as the head of the Second Police Precinct. This recommendation will soon be submitted to "Mayor" Chen Gongbo for final approval.</p>
<p>Deputy Director-General Still Awaiting Approval</p>
<p>An agreement on the establishment of the new police force stipulates that the Western Shanghai Outer Road area will be divided into five police districts, one of which will be the responsibility of a European police officer (Second District), a Japanese police officer will also be in charge of one district, and the remaining three districts will be managed by three people appointed by the "City" government. So far, the Public Concession has only officially nominated two senior police officers for the new police force, one is Pan Da, who has been approved as Director-General, and the other is Inspector Clisha, who has been designated as Deputy Director, which has not yet been approved by the "City" government, but reliable sources expect that Chen Gongbo will approve it after returning to Shanghai from an important political meeting in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Settlement Police Officers Must Be Replenished</p>
<p>It was also heard yesterday morning that other personnel of the new police force will be selected from the existing police officers of the Public Concession and the "City" government. An officer from the Public Concession Police Department stated yesterday morning that some police officers from the Public Concession may be transferred to the new police force in February, so the Police Department will recruit additional police officers to maintain its existing strength.</p>
<p>Internal Organization Is in Progress</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that after the signing of the Shanghai Western Police Power Agreement, the organization of the Special Police Department is underway. The Municipal Council has nominated two candidates for Director-General, and it is rumored that the position of Criminal Section Chief will be taken by Superintendent Blandinksopp of the Municipal Council Police Department. Blandinksopp is responsible for the New Gate Police Station.</p>

<p>February 22nd is the birthday of Washington, the first president of the United States. The American people traditionally take a holiday on this day to commemorate it enthusiastically. However, this year, due to the tense situation in the Far East, it is not planned to be extravagant. The U.S. Consul in Shanghai has announced that no official celebrations will be held, and the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Community Association have also stated that there are no celebration plans. That is, the dance party and other social gatherings that are usually held at the Columbia Country Club will also be canceled this year. Due to the evacuation of Americans from American schools, celebration plans have been greatly changed. Although there will be considerable commemorative measures at that time, there will be no grand celebrations.</p>

<p>Kodder, the Information Officer of the German Embassy in China, stated to the press yesterday that "So far, more than 100,000 people in Shanghai have been invited to see the film describing the victory of the German army on the Western Front, but there are still 20,000 to 25,000 letters requesting tickets, and those who feel regret. Due to technical reasons, the film cannot be re-screened again. However, another new film is on its way from Berlin. Once the film arrives in Shanghai, it will be screened on a regular basis to entertain all walks of life. The new film is a historical depiction of the German High Command's operations on the Western Front. It was shown on Broadway in New York and was sold out for several weeks in a row. Its attention-grabbing nature can be imagined.</p>
<p>Kodder continued, "It is scheduled to invite the local press to visit the news film that has arrived here next Monday (17th). The film has a vivid depiction of Germany's construction projects in Europe. After inviting the press, the film will also be scheduled to invite people from all walks of life to visit.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Rice Prices Fall <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>It is learned that 50,000 bags of foreign rice will arrive within the next ten days. It is also learned that British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., German firm Defoe &amp; Co., Swiss firm Fu Jia &amp; Co., Japanese firm Nikko &amp; Co., and Shenji, Jianyuan, Nanyang Enterprise, and other companies have recently telegraphed to the rice-producing areas in West Luo, Rangoon, and other places to negotiate the transaction of a large amount of foreign rice, totaling more than 200,000 bags. The foreign rice that has been transacted will be transported to Shanghai for regulation in a short period of time. Yesterday, sources in the foreign firm community revealed that recently, as foreign exchange has become more relaxed and foreign rice production prices have fallen, many large rice merchants have entrusted various foreign firms to purchase them, and there are not a few people whose number is more than 5,000 bags. Yesterday's rice market, due to the long-term release of foreign exchange and the availability of sufficient reserves, the prices of various grades of rice have fallen to varying degrees. According to the rice industry, rice prices may continue to fall in the near future.</p>
<p>The Rice Storage Committee's 200,000 bags of stored rice are mostly assumed by rice industry organizations, reaching 60,000 bags, worth about 6 million in cash. According to a gentleman familiar with the rice industry, there are about 800 rice stores, more than 200 rice firms, and more than 30 miscellaneous grain businesses in the city, with a total capital of about 30 million. Then the payment of 6 million for public warehouse funds accounts for about one-fifth of the total capital of the city's rice industry. It is also learned that the revised rules of the rice industry market, which were decided to be revised at the Rice Market Management Committee meeting the day before yesterday, will be drafted today and submitted to the Bean and Rice Association for review and then promulgated and implemented.</p>
<p>Flour merchants in this city have recently ordered from Australia, Canada, and the United States, among which Australia has the most. The cost is only about 18 yuan per bag, and a profit of more than 5 yuan can be obtained. Therefore, other merchants are also rushing to join the reservation, with a total number of no less than 1 million bags. It is heard that 300,000 bags will be shipped this month, and the rest will be shipped in batches soon. By then, the reserves will be greatly increased and will be sufficient for five months of need.</p>

<h3 id="e51">In Memory of Mr. Xiong Deshan (2) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Nan Hu</p>
<p>After Yuan Shikai's attempt to restore the monarchy in the fifth year of the Republic failed, I went from Sichuan to Beijing to resume my post as a member of parliament. Mr. Xiong frequently traveled between Beijing and Hubei, associating with scholars and literati like Mr. Ping. At that time, the New Culture Movement was just beginning to sprout, and he often wrote articles for various newspapers and publications, expressing his personal aspirations. During the gestation of the May Fourth Movement, he was deeply moved and played a significant role in planning and campaigning for it. He edited a weekly magazine called "New China," which ceased publication due to various reasons after being published for more than ten months.</p>
<p>By the tenth year of the Republic, socialist ideas, influenced by the Soviet Revolution, had spread to China. Mr. Xiong, Kuang Mohan, and I devoted ourselves to studying the practical facilities of the labor and peasant government and exploring the true meaning of Marxism. We organized a Marxist study group at that time. Mr. Xiong's early studies in social science and Japanese, which had long been neglected, were rekindled with diligent effort. His later contributions to academia were mainly based on the foundation laid at that time. He and Kuang Mohan, along with seven or eight others, briefly joined the Socialist Youth League (S.Y., the predecessor of C.Y.) which was just being organized. In January of the eleventh year, Mr. Xiong, Kuang Mohan, and I organized the Communist Comrades Society, publishing various publications. Mr. Xiong's translations of "Critique of the Gotha Program" and "History of the International Workingmen's Association" were important documents related to the labor movement, and Engels' authoritative work "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State" was also first introduced to China by him.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the eleventh year, Qu Qiubai returned to China from the Soviet Union. Through the mediation and introduction of Mr. Xiong and Liu Zitong, we all joined the CP and dissolved the Communist Comrades Society. However, our organizational relationship with the CP was soon severed. After that, he gradually shifted completely from politics to academics.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth year, I recommended Chen Hongshu to be the Director of Education in Hubei Province. At the suggestion of Mr. Xiong, Qian Tieru, Ning Dunwu, and Deng Chumin, Mr. Zhang Huaijiu (Zhiben) was recommended as the president of the Beihu Law School, and Mr. Xiong served as a professor, marking the beginning of his career in education. At that time, it was the height of the National Revolution. He and Mr. Qian and Mr. Ning lived in the northern corner of Wuchang City. Every day, many young people would come to them to discuss issues, and they devoted their energy to guiding them. The residence became an invisible gathering place for revolutionary youth in Wuhan, which was the period when he had the deepest influence on young people. Now Mr. Xiong has passed away, and most of those young people have already sacrificed themselves for the revolution! During the siege of Wuchang in the Northern Expedition, they were trapped in the besieged city, enduring hardship, but they still risked hunger and their lives to continue guiding the revolutionary youth.</p>
<p>After the National Revolutionary Army captured Wuchang, the Wuchang Higher Normal School was used as the foundation, and other national and provincial higher specialized schools were merged to form a university (the predecessor of Wuhan University). Mr. Xiong was one of the famous professors at that time. Until the Wuhan coup in the autumn of the sixteenth year, he could no longer live in Wuchang, so he took refuge in Shanghai, writing articles for various newspapers and magazines from time to time. In the eighteenth year, he, Li Da, Qian Tieru, Ning Dunwu, Zhang Dingfu, Deng Chumin, Shi Cuntong, and others opened the Kunlun Bookstore, systematically introducing famous works of social science. Mr. Xiong specialized in social history and economics, and his important works and translations include "Research on Chinese Social History," "A History of Materialist Economics," and "Basic Theory of Marxist Economics." He was also one of the participants in the debate on Chinese social history after the twentieth year of the Republic. The two articles he provided for the debate—"A Historical Description of the Chinese Peasant Problem" and "A Study on the Emergence of Chinese Commercial Capital"—were also examined with a prudent scientific attitude to review the longitudinal section of Chinese society. In the article on the peasant problem, his analysis of the stagnant phenomenon of material rent in China, and in the article on commercial capital, his clarification of various fallacies of the time based on Marx's views, both had extraordinary insights. He absolutely did not have the common problem of arbitrary abuse and scolding that was found among those who generally participated in the debate.</p>
<p>From the twentieth year of the Republic, he taught at the Shanghai College of Law and Politics in Dapuqiao for several years. In the twenty-fourth year, he was hired as a professor at the Liangfeng Normal College in Guangxi, lecturing on Chinese General History. The following year, Liangshi merged into Guangxi University and was renamed the College of Liberal Arts, and he continued to serve as a professor of general history. That general history lecture notes can be regarded as the crystallization of his final efforts and also as a rare masterpiece in history books, but he only lectured up to the Ming Dynasty before passing away. It is said that Mr. Li is currently proofreading and editing it for him. Once Mr. Li's preface is completed, Mr. Qian and I will proofread it again and send it to print to fulfill his unfinished initial wish. (To be continued)</p>

It is now learned that the four arrested workers were approved by the police station yesterday to be released on bail. Yesterday, a so-called "Second District Water and Electricity Industry Union" sent a letter, making a defense on this matter. The main points are as follows: (1) Always uphold the principle of seeking the welfare of the masses and not being exploited by anyone. Collecting membership fees is a regular practice on the tenth of each month. (2) Regarding the compensation for Zhang Yongkang, who was injured and died during the strike, a total of 2,400 yuan in national currency was collected. Except for 850 yuan that Zhang's mother successively received, only 1,550 yuan remained. It was originally intended to be distributed to the deceased's mother in advance. However, because there was another type of donation, it would be distributed to Zhang's mother together after the collection was completed. Unexpectedly, a few people clashed with the staff. Regarding this matter, Zhang's mother will provide evidence based on the facts to inform the public. (3) It has absolutely nothing to do with the 28 suspects arrested for the killing of inspector Chen Guohua, because the Chen case occurred before the strike. Also, the statement that the workers raised 5,600 yuan and transferred it to the families of the arrested is completely unfounded.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that robbers often mix in with public buses and rob passengers of their property recently, the Public Concession Police Department has specially ordered the search team to specialize in searching public buses. At 7:10 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Chinese and Western detectives of the police department's search team searched bus No. 15137 of Route 10 on Beijing Road and found a Ma brand handgun with four bullets on the floor next to the seats in the rear half of the bus. When picked up, the gun handle was still slightly warm, indicating that it had been discarded just moments before.</p>
<p>Discarded the Gun</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the investigation, all the passengers in the bus were taken to the Laozha Police Station. After investigation by Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan, it was determined that the passengers in the front half of the bus were far away from the gun and had no criminal suspicion, so they were released. However, the passengers in the rear half of the bus who were close to the gun, including Dong Ruihua, Xing Bu'ao, Wang Shenggui, Shen Yuanyuan, Wang Rongding, Gao Zhikang, Jiang A'er, Shu Jisheng, Yang Tinggeng, Wu Jinrong, Yuan Haiqing, and Zheng Meifu, were highly suspicious, so they were</p>

The police department's lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the confiscated handgun was the one that was robbed from the police officer of Siwen Police Station at No. 403 Cihou South Lane, Hartung Road, on the 10th of last month. Now, because it cannot be determined who placed the gun on the floor of the bus, it is requested that they be temporarily detained, pending further investigation to determine whether to prosecute or release them separately. Judge Feng核稟 ordered that all suspects be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, the exchange rate quotations, had no ups and downs. In the black market for British and US exchange rates, the trend of easing continued throughout the day under the selling pressure, and speculators generally sold off. The US exchange rate this month has exceeded one million yuan, and the Sino-American Bank has also provided a lot. In the morning, the transaction price of the US exchange rate ranged from 5.4375 yuan to 5.46875 yuan. This was due to the continued negative news from abroad. Although the US freezing of French and German funds was not related to the exchange market, people's minds were affected. Also, the rumor that the US garrison in this city was withdrawing and the tense rumors between Japan and the US both expanded the selling pressure. However, the afternoon close was still fixed. The market softened slightly later, and then the market spread rumors of some kind of positive news. Speculators came back to buy back, and the price rebounded slightly. At the close, the spot price reached 5.4375 yuan, while the British exchange rate persisted at 3 pence 375, which was neither better nor worse than the previous day.</p>

And a certain US bank initially offered 5.4375 yuan for the US exchange rate in February to outsiders, and then filled Yuliy, which had depreciated to 5.46875 yuan.

<h3 id="e61">Negative News Intensifies, Gold Market Declines Sharply <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash red disc black market, due to the further easing of the foreign exchange rate and a lot of negative news from abroad, the continued decline was still fierce. It only hovered above 6,500 yuan once after opening, and then it always fell steadily at the 6,400 yuan mark, and once broke into the 6,400 yuan level, to 6,395 yuan. This was the price at about 2:30 p.m. The wind suddenly reported a rebound in the evening, because foreign exchange speculators suddenly turned from filling to digging, and various positive rumors were mixed in, people's hearts rose slightly, and it was pulled to 6,480 yuan. As a result, it closed at 6,477 yuan, down 41 yuan from the previous day. After the close, the field price first reached 85 yuan, and then only 72 yuan. As for the spot price, in the morning, Fei Wenyuan and others sold a total of 200 taels of Xianghe Qiantai, and the price was 47 yuan higher than the futures price.

<p>Once Broke the 6,400 Yuan Level</p>
<p>In the early morning, the environment was empty and the momentum was magnificent. The opening was difficult to rise, only 6,510 yuan, 8 yuan lower than the bottom of the previous day. After opening, it was heard again that the foreign exchange rate continued to harden, and the saying that the United States froze funds was still strong. Under the selling of Xinfeng, Yongfeng, Dafeng, etc., it retreated into the 500 yuan level, to 6,480 yuan. However, Yida Hesheng and others made up for the slight rise to 6,525 yuan. But after that, people's hearts became more and more scattered. The reason was that the US garrison in this city would make a retreat, and the news that the relationship between Japan and the US would inevitably deteriorate was considered to be negative news. The selling or filling was accelerated. Especially the bill merchants such as Dafeng, Yida, Xinfeng, Dezi, and Hengji all vomited wildly. Soon it fell to 6,450 yuan. Later, relying on Defu to buy back some, it stopped falling and slightly rebounded by ten yuan to 6,465 yuan. However, the final buying wind passed by, and the price was even lower. It is estimated that Yi Yuan, Mingfeng, Tongkang, and Yong, etc., sold to 6,425 yuan. At noon, bill merchants such as Feng Yong, etc., scooped up a little, and it closed at 6,445 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was tired, at 6,420 yuan. Before long, Xiangxing Yongjin reached 6,335 yuan. Unexpectedly, Yi Yuan, Mingfeng, and others could not support the fierce filling and entered the 400 yuan level, seeing the low price of 6,395 yuan. Later, it was reported that the exchange market slightly tended to soften, and there were vague rumors of positive news, which aroused a considerable Yuan wind. It is estimated that Xinfeng Yong, Tongkang Chengji, Tiancheng Yida, and Suifu, etc., competed to buy, reaching 6,480 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 6,477 yuan, which was 41 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. After the close, it was heard that it had been as good as 85 yuan, but the final market price was only 72 yuan. The fluctuation throughout the day was 130 yuan. The selling price of the current brand gold of the cash number was more than 10 yuan higher than the red futures delivery, and the grazing was 40 yuan lower than the sale. The current standard gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no opening.</p>

<p>The exchange price of silver shop jewelry gold was 10 yuan lower at noon, and 10 yuan higher back at 4 p.m. It is estimated that Da Tonghang County was 670 yuan, and the new Tonghang was similar to the previous price, and the grazing was 30 yuan lower, etc. Yesterday, the foreign currency market price, the red market price, turned up after falling, and finally tended to soften slightly. British and American gold pounds also fell slightly after falling, and finally fell by one yuan each compared with the previous day. British gold notes were still as fixed as before, and the market price was flat. The US gold note once rose to 18 yuan 23 points at the beginning, but immediately fell. In the afternoon, it retreated to 17 yuan 95 points, and finally it was 18 yuan 14 points, which was six points lower than the previous day. The Hong Kong note then tended to rise again, and in the evening the market price was as high as 4 yuan 55 points. The Japanese gold note and the Korean note continued to rise, the former rose to 1 yuan 72 and a half points, and the latter rose to 1 yuan 33 and a half points.</p>

<p>The public debt black market resumed trading in two sessions, morning and afternoon, yesterday. The market situation was relatively strong, and financial circles still had spot filling out and selling at high prices. The current multiple approach is clearly different from that of last year. Last year, the multiple approach continued to have good news, so there was the joy of doubling the effort. This year's multiple approach, the environment is not as beneficial as last year, such as the floating capital is not as abundant as last year, the relationship with Japan is becoming more and more deteriorating, the relationship between China and Japan has absolutely no room for negotiation, the interest has already been paid, so it is not easy to have a special surge in price, there are many people selling at high prices, so there is the sigh of doing twice the work with half the results. Yesterday morning, Renmao's import volume was relatively large for several months, with Jing 競 Lianyi and Hongda buying in as secondary. And the seller Lianhe sold out 400,000, and Yuxing and Tongkang were still consistent sellers, which is slightly noticeable. The market price was only slightly better for C and E, at 13 points. In the afternoon, Renchang continued to have a small number of imports, and Xinhua Lianyi also had buying in. Lianhe slightly made up for tens of thousands, while Yuxing was still a consistent seller, and Tiansheng代金融界 also sold out in large numbers. Zhenchang Hengkang Tongkang still had selling, and various were up 34 points. Only B was up 7 points due to the round of interest drawing, and E was up 85 points alone because the price was superficially too much different from C, so it was up 6 points for both C and D, and A was only up 15 points, which is the usual phenomenon after its drawing. 96 suddenly rose to nearly 8 yuan, because the North Gang suddenly had stomach volume, and the number of transactions was estimated at about 2.67 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Water Army stock were traded, and the price was 8 yuan 95 points.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Grains: Imported Rice Arrives in Abundance, Rice Prices Level Off Daily <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. vessel "Tingsang" arrived from Hong Kong carrying 10,473 bags of foreign rice and 101 bags of maize. It docked at the Roosevelt Wharf at 1:00 PM yesterday to unload. The Swire Shipping Company vessel "Hanyang" also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Hong Kong, carrying 2,611 bags of foreign rice. It docked at the [unnamed] Company Wharf outside the French Concession to unload. An additional 1,281 bags will be transported to Tianjin on the same vessel tomorrow. Furthermore, the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. vessel "Hosang" arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon; it is said to have also carried foreign rice, but the exact quantity is unclear and will be reported after investigation today. (Zu)</p>
<p>The rice market has been flooded with a continuous influx of rice. The foreign exchange rate has been easing for days, which is advantageous for the import of foreign rice. Moreover, with the continuous arrival of rice, the stock of rice in Shanghai has more than doubled. People, seeing the abundance of rice, have no intention of stocking up. Consequently, sales are sluggish, and sellers lack the strength to support prices. Stockpilers dare not even think of accumulating inventory. Closing prices were half to one yuan lower than the previous day's. No. 1 new Saigon rice was priced at 81.5 to 81 yuan, Pudong godown rice at 80.05 yuan, Annam glutinous rice at 82.5 to 82 yuan, No. 2 rice at 78 to 76 yuan, No. 1 special rice at 81 to 80 yuan, Zhongguan rice at 78 to 79 yuan, and fire-milled rice at 80.05 yuan, then down to 78.8 yuan, small-milled rice at 73.8 to 73.5 yuan, Pudong godown rice at 72.6 to 72 yuan, large-milled rice at 71.5 to 71 yuan, Tokyo polished rice at 72 yuan, special rice bran at 71 yuan, general market rice at 70 to 69 yuan, and broken polished rice at 65 yuan, then down to No. 3 rice at 56.5 yuan. Spot sales of English Chinese Company small-milled rice were offered at only 85.4 to 85.5 yuan, which was a small amount. Forward sales for February and March were 86.5 to 86.6 yuan, and No. 1 Saigon rice for February was 93 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was over 400 tons, with spot rice less than 6,000 bags.</p>
<p>Thick and thin glutinous rice and other domestic rice shipments have arrived sporadically, slightly more than before, but due to poor sales, the market has difficulty holding steady and has fallen half a yuan in line with foreign rice. Changbang raw white glutinous rice was priced at 105 to 106 yuan, and by the picul, 101 to 102 yuan; Kunshan raw glutinous rice was 103 to 104 yuan, and by the picul, 100 to 99.5 yuan; Qingjiao thin rice was 94 yuan by the picul; there was a lack of raw bagged goods and no market.</p>
<p>Transactions of glutinous rice were rare, and there was little change in the market. However, special white glutinous rice was uniquely popular due to its scarcity and aroma. Hong Kong special round-grain glutinous rice was priced at 81.5 yuan, while general market goods remained at 80 to 78 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Foreign Wheat Orders Have Arrived in Port; Returned Flour Is Being Sold for the First Time <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Spot transactions of foreign flour continue to be sluggish. This is because factory-ordered foreign wheat has already arrived in port, increasing the supply. Also, it is now acceptable for a small number of customers to sell, so the returned goods are being released first. As actual sales to local customers are not good, the market is invisibly loosening. The price of Flower &amp; Bird brand Australian flour is 24.4 to 24 yuan, slightly lower than before by 3 to 4 cents. Futures transactions are scarce, and buyers and sellers are cautious. Chinese factory flour is still selling for 23 yuan. Amidst this soft market, the supply from each factory is gradually becoming more abundant, while actual sales are lower than the prescribed amount. This is because, with rice prices looking weak, people's minds are difficult to steady.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains dull and stable. The Suzhou factory is not eager to purchase local wheat, as newly arrived foreign wheat is being unloaded. Japanese factories are still purchasing at limited prices, but only absorbing small amounts at the retail level, lacking any substantial volume.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Oilcake: Oilcake Prices Drop Across the Board <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oilcake market showed a general decline. The reason was sluggish actual sales, an unfavorable environment for bullish traders, and eager resale, resulting in a general drop in prices. As a result, peanut oil and factory oil maintained their original prices. Spot Dalian soybean oil fell by 2 yuan, and futures oil fell by 3 to 4 yuan. Transactions included 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 100 loads of Dayou factory soybean oil, and 100 barrels of Dasu soybean oil, as well as 400 barrels of soybean oil futures. The outflow of spot cakes is stagnant, and futures cakes are falling continuously due to market sentiment and their speculative nature, falling by 1 to 3 cents. A total of over 70,000 pieces of various brands of futures cakes were offered. Today, 5,895 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Yarn and Cotton: Large Players Exit, Yarn Market Plummets, Double Horse Brand Enters the 1,400 Yuan Mark, Dropping a Total of 91 Yuan in Two Days <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to weaken, and the price decline was especially intense. This was because speculators were uneasy, and rumors abounded in the market. Major players were heavily liquidating their positions, and floating traders became even more anxious in light of this situation. Moreover, actual transactions were extremely sluggish. As a result, when the market loosened, prices plummeted. 20-count Double Horse yarn broke through the 400 yuan barrier. The highest price was 1,443 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,389 yuan. It was initially traded at 1,393 yuan in the afternoon, followed by 1,384 yuan, and the final price was 1,408 yuan. Some buyers were interested.</p>
<p>The opening price for Double Horse in the morning was low due to the previous day's large decline, and most market participants were taking a wait-and-see approach. Since the price had already fallen significantly, the opening price was 1,440 yuan, rising slightly to 43 yuan. Then, news spread that the foreign exchange rate was flat and gold prices were falling, and the price dropped to 1,427 yuan. But short covering pushed the price back up to 1,442 yuan. This cycle repeated three or four times. Unexpectedly, after 1:00 PM, rumors in the market intensified, claiming that the foreign exchange rate was being frozen and gold prices were falling sharply. Sellers rushed in like a flood, and the market volume decreased, plummeting below the 1,400 yuan mark, down to 1,389 yuan. The closing price was 1,394 yuan. According to statistics, 8,850 bales were traded in half a day, all among industry peers. The price of 20-count Variant Horse yarn fell by 51 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Cotton Market Stagnant <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is that the market is extremely weak due to the disastrous decline in the yarn market. Domestic and foreign factories are all hesitant to act, so prices are also trending downward. Trading has completely stalled.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Piece Goods: Selling Pressure Dominates the Market, Importers Hesitant, Resulting in Repeated Low Offers <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Factory cloth prices fell yesterday, and the market stabilized later in the day. The opening prices were consistently lower, continuing the previous day's weakness. Due to pervasive selling pressure, actual sales customers were wary of buying, and floating traders were particularly anxious. Therefore, low bids were frequent and transactions were quiet. The lowest price for Dapeng Fugui fine cloth was 41 yuan. As a result of transactions, fine cloth and twill continued to fall by 1 to 1.5 yuan per piece, coarse cloth fell by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth prices varied, falling by 0.5 to 1 yuan per piece. This street saw the transaction of over 400 pieces of various cloths, and the Ningbo-Ningbo color and bleached cloths exceeded 100 pieces. The Fujian-Guangdong color cloths, pongee and bleached cloths amounted to one hundred and dozens of pieces. 54 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Singapore on the 12th.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth prices fell sharply. The White Dragon Head cloth opened at 46.78 yuan, rose to 47.8 yuan, and then, with the sharp fall in yarn prices and strong selling pressure, fell back to 46.5 yuan at midday closing. The after-market dark market was even weaker, with the lowest price being 45.5 yuan. But, due to the continuous sharp drop, Tianjin traders and scattered stockpilers covered their positions and searched for goods, rebounding to 46.75 yuan. (Stock Exchange) The closing prices for futures were 47 yuan for February, 48.75 yuan for March, 50.05 yuan for April, and 51.12 yuan for May.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Slightly <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, sentiment in the sugar market improved, and the trend was positive, with prices rising a few cents. The association set prices: spot No. 24 raw white foreign warehouse at 80.08 yuan, shipments scheduled for February 24th at 81.1 yuan, shipments scheduled for the end of February at 81.3 yuan, and shipments scheduled for the 10th of next month at 81.5 to 81.4 yuan, an increase of 3 to 4 cents. Taikoo granulated sugar saw little fluctuation. B mark Western warehouse at 80 to 80.2 yuan, DY mark Western warehouse at 78.2 to 78.4 yuan, and HX mark Western warehouse at 77.9 to 78.2 yuan, an increase of 2 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Coal: With a Chilly Spring, White Coal Is Still in Demand <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Since the sharp drop in bituminous coal prices recently, the coal market has been rather weak. However, the sales of white coal are still very brisk due to the chilly spring, and transactions among peers are not quiet, so prices remain stable. Yesterday, the opening price for Tongdelibai white coal, No. 1, 2, and 3 lump warehouse receipts, was 245 yuan per ton. The Douzhuang Festival lump coal in this street was 156 yuan, including delivery.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Hardware: Staples Stockpilers Release Their Inventory <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The staple market has been deteriorating daily. This is because stockpilers are releasing large quantities of inventory, and the market is feeling more congested. Moreover, actual transactions are not smooth because the Nanyang routes have not recovered, and northern merchants are only making sparse purchases. Although there are sporadic transactions on this street, it is difficult to reverse the declining trend. Therefore, opening prices are falling step by step, and market sentiment is weakening. Last year, the price of Tongbeisijia staples was listed at 100 yuan, but there were still few inquiries. Raw materials (wire rods) have also been dragged down. The market price yesterday was around 120 yuan per load, also down by about 10 to 20 yuan. Furthermore, 250 bundles of wire were shipped from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Miscellaneous: Upper-Grade Cigarettes Increase in Price <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Sales of mid-range cigarettes are sluggish, and purchase prices are weakening. The prices of upper-grade cigarettes are rising due to the limited quantity released by the factories, which is insufficient for market sales. For example, 50-cigarette Da Nanwei are at 1,050 yuan per 10,000, 20-cigarette Da Nanwei are at 1,080 yuan per 10,000, and 50-cigarette Da Sanpaotai are at 700 yuan per 10,000. The Hua Cheng Company has halved the distribution of cigarettes to industry peers, so purchase prices on the market continue to be tight. Da Meili brand middle boxes are offered at 730 yuan, Jinshu brand middle boxes at 470 yuan, and the factory price of Ruilun 50-cigarette flat-pack Consul brand cigarettes has increased to 920 yuan.</p>

<p>The final battle of the 13th Western Youth Invitational Basketball League will be held tonight at 8:15 PM. Huaxing and the McClain Military Officers, both with perfect records, will compete for the championship. Huaxing has emerged as a dark horse this year, boasting strong players such as Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Bao Songyuan, and Ren Xiangcheng, all top talents of their time. The return of Wang Hongbin has further strengthened their strength. Their lineup is strong, and their offense and defense are both excellent. The McClain Military Officers feature key players from the American team, including sharpshooter Hanshawitz, and Luo Qi, Stockton, and Simpson are all brave players with excellent skills. With the two teams meeting, the outcome will determine the championship, and a fierce battle is to be expected. In order to limit the audience, the Western Youth authorities have increased ticket prices to 3 and 4 yuan, and all tickets have now been sold out. Before the final, there will be a match between Liangxi and Little Bear, starting at 7:15 PM. If Liangxi can overcome Little Bear, they will be tied for sixth place with last year's champion, Paramount. Since the Shanghai Hujiang University won the first championship, all Westerners have been out of the finals. Last year, Paramount participated in the competition under the name of Strong China and won the Western Youth championship that they had been hoping for but failed to achieve for eleven years, which is truly commendable. It is hoped that they can overcome the enemy and be crowned champions this year, to prevent the brilliant silver trophy from falling back into the hands of Westerners. The schedule for tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Liangxi Team vs. Little Bear Team 7:15 PM</p>
<p>Huaxing Team vs. McClain Officers 8:15 PM</p>

<p>(Leiyang Correspondent) The Hunan Provincial Government issued instructions to the commissioner's offices and county governments, directing them to order the primary school teachers under their jurisdiction to teach with peace of mind and await gradual improvements in their treatment, refraining from strikes. The document stated: "National education is the fundamental plan, and primary school teachers bear the important responsibility of teaching and training. Only through hard work can success be achieved. The government is well aware of the hardships and burdens of the times and is deeply concerned, issuing frequent encouragements, hoping that they will endure the temporary hardships and complete a monumental task. The government is making its utmost efforts to gradually improve salaries and treatment, and the repeated orders are not just empty words. Lower-level teachers should bear the heavy responsibility entrusted by the country and avoid feeling ashamed of themselves. They should be more loyal, devoted to their duties, and await improved treatment. Recently, it has been reported that some have used the pretext of demanding salary increases, stopping classes and making demands, which is harmful to the country, themselves, and the students, and is inappropriate. In addition to issuing separate orders, this urgent order requires you to immediately forward this to primary school teachers under your jurisdiction, so they understand the government's sincerity in caring for them, recognize the importance of their own responsibilities, teach with peace of mind, await gradual improvements in treatment, and refrain from demanding salary increases by taking strike action. You must also investigate and crack down on such behavior to avoid neglect, which is of utmost importance."</p>

<h3 id="e82">Song of Returning Spring <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Wenqiang</p>
<p>These past two days, I have been waking up earlier than usual for some reason. Perhaps it is because I was awakened by the sharp shouts of the night soil collectors, and I couldn't fall back asleep. It turns out that since the Lunar New Year's Day, the night soil collectors have been "visiting" at 6:30 AM.</p>
<p>"It's better to get up early and take a run in the street." Once the idea was decided, I carried it out. As soon as I ran out of the door and onto the street, two vegetable vendors came head-on.</p>
<p>"Ah, after the Beginning of Spring, the vegetables can't stand the heat. As soon as they touch the sun, they will wrinkle up and look terrible." The vegetable vendor said.</p>
<p>"Yes. After the Beginning of Spring, it really is spring." The other vegetable vendor replied.</p>
<p>They quickly walked past.</p>
<p>"Spring has arrived," "Isn't this warm and bright weather spring?" I slowed my pace, walking and thinking softly.</p>
<p>Straight through from Danshui Road is Rue Say Zoong, and from Rue Say Zoong, you are on Avenue Joffre. Neat and tidy trees stand upright on both sides of the road, leaving behind some withered leaves and branches after winter. Across the street, I could see a few people climbing on the trees from afar. What were they doing up the trees? As I approached, I realized that they were there to prune the trees. This was public service. They slowly used small geared knives and large shears to cut off the dead branches and leaves on the trees, and then used some pine oil to coat the newly exposed branch ends. I heard that this serves two purposes: one is protection, and the other is to make the color of the newly exposed white branch ends the same as the tree trunk.</p>
<p>The newly cut branches were snatched up by people who bought them for three yuan and five jiao per dan.</p>
<p>Children picked up the branches on the ground, you hitting me, I hitting him, he hitting you, everyone chasing and making noise.</p>
<p>Right at the entrance of a lane turning at the side of the road, a little boy was sunbathing, and was practicing "physical sunbathing". Leaning against the corner of the wall, he took off the only piece of clothing he had on and was catching "Little Monkey Kings" with flapping sounds.</p>
<p>I only learned about "Little Monkey Kings" from a little boy today, because I just heard him saying, "Little Monkey King, where are you escaping to!" Then, he stuffed his right hand into his mouth, and the "Little Monkey King" entered the "Buddha's" mouth.</p>
<p>Has spring really arrived? Yes, spring is coming to the world.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Sigh of the Night <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Hao</p>
<h3 id="e84">Lamp <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>The lamp gradually brightened.</p>
<p>It was not a big lamp, with a circumference of barely a foot, and it was so commonplace! The transparent glass shade nakedly revealed the small, wooden candlestick. Its maker seemed to be stingy with ingenuity, unwilling to show off his skills, and did not add a single flower or a stroke of color.</p>
<p>But therefore, this lamp with a small red candle burning inside radiated a different kind of brilliance.</p>
<p>I carried the small lamp, running back and forth. Wherever I ran, the darkness quickly retreated. Then, the firelight illuminated everything and comforted everything.</p>
<p>I seemed to feel that I was that fire, that light.</p>
<p>I stretched the lamp under the bed. The halo also illuminated this dark corner. Suddenly, a scratching sound, — something small scurried across the back of my foot.</p>
<p>A mouse!</p>
<p>I smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>I don't know when humans started lighting lamps. The Greeks say that Prometheus was chained to a high mountain to suffer the torment of eagles forever for stealing fire from heaven for humans. We not only got cooked food, but also could light lamps. With lamps, we no longer have to grope in the dim ignorance, and life becomes radiant and no longer muddled and lacking brilliance. What a brilliant help lamps have given to the progress of mankind!</p>
<p>Of course, there are also many who hate lamps. This mouse is one of them. That's because the lamp exposes its sneaky deeds. If it could use violence, it would put out the lamp.</p>
<p>I held the lamp tightly. Looking at it was interesting. First, a spark of fire, gradually becoming brilliant. The cyan flame stretched out peacefully and joyfully, as if to engulf all the surrounding darkness. And the entire life of this red candle seemed to exist only for generating heat and emitting light... Even in the last moment, it burst out with brilliant sparks, revealing constant struggle and fighting!</p>
<p>Please raise your lamps high. They will illuminate the night sky like thousands of stars, because people are so unfamiliar and unaccustomed to the night and the darkness!</p>
<h3 id="e85">Begonia <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>As other guests were invited up to speak, Yuan Baofan's eyes rolled more vigorously over the faces of the female students. By the time the guest's speech was over, and Governor Wang had handed out dozens of graduation diplomas, he had also familiarized himself with the face of every relatively attractive young woman. Just as he was using his brain, which was adept at doing evil, to try to think of a wicked idea that could immediately satisfy his desires, he suddenly heard the old man standing in the corner shout in a hoarse voice: "Student representative to deliver a thank-you speech." Then, a tall and graceful female student without makeup stepped out from the seventh row.</p>
<p>Before Luo Xiangqi's body had even settled on the stage, Yuan Zhen Song's senses were already half-numb. If Military Governor Hu had been a little slower to nudge him with his elbow, warning him not to do anything rash, he would at least have used his gifted voice to shout out "Bravo!" Because for him, schools and theaters were no different!</p>
<p>Beforehand, Luo Xiangqi had prepared a thank-you speech. Walking onto the stage, she held a piece of white paper in her hand and slowly recited it in a very crisp voice.</p>
<p>The silver bell-like voice struck Yuan Baofan's eardrums one after another, making him feel itchy from the bottom of his heart. His eyes were fixed on Luo Xiangqi's face. Her black hair, straight nose, shining eyes, slightly red lips, and white-yellowish complexion, as if carved from ivory, all firmly attracted his heart like a magnet. But in all of this, there was no trace of the seductive element he often saw, only like an unopened lotus flower offered before the Buddha's seat.</p>
<p>"Good brother, I can't read. Quickly, let me see what the girl's name is!" Yuan Baofan anxiously leaned into Military Governor Hu's ear and asked repeatedly.</p>
<p>"Her name isn't written on her body. Where do you expect me to look?" The person being asked immediately rebuffed him.</p>
<p>"Her name must be written on that list, right?" The Garrison Commander Yuan regarded the order list posted on the wall as the playbill in a theater, pointed to it with his finger, and repeatedly asked Military Governor Hu. (28)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Inside the New City God Temple <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Yuting</p>
<p>Heaps and heaps of heads burrowed into the City God Temple, forming a tide-like crowd. The crowding, wriggling, and clamor were no different from the old City God Temple.</p>
<p>The main hall was packed with devout men and women, burning incense and lighting candles to communicate with the gods and offer prayers. They, at this moment, shared a similar selfish heart, which was to seek the blessing of the Bodhisattva. Waves of heat came from inside the hall, making it feel like standing next to a furnace. No wonder the City God Bodhisattva's face has been particularly rosy these past few days.</p>
<p>The seats in the dim sum shops, clearly marked as such, were all occupied. Diners chatted and laughed, while also paying attention to the hustle and bustle outside the shop. One batch had not yet left, and another was already preparing to grab seats. The busyness of the business made the waiters feel overwhelmed, truly unable to keep up.</p>
<p>Various kinds of lanterns, competing for beauty and novelty, were hung in the shops, and even the alleyways were filled with red and green ones, vying for the favor of tourists. Exquisite toys were displayed on stalls and in glass cabinets. The variety was so great that they had to be hung by ropes, trying to attract people's attention as much as possible. Children, passing by the toy shops, lingered reluctantly, clamoring to buy something. Only when they had one or two items in their hands did they leave, skipping and playing. Otherwise, they would pout, and some would even shed tears. It all depended on the adults' ability to deceive the children.</p>
<p>Selling fake jewelry was also a characteristic of the City God Temple market. Just talking about rings worth two jiao each, the variety of settings was enough to dazzle you. The craftsmanship was so good that it was almost indistinguishable from the real thing, with jadeite, agate, diamonds… but unfortunately, they were all fake. Several rows of customers stood in front of the shops, selecting, trying them on, and curiosity and the desire for a bargain drew coins from their purses.</p>
<p>The place was much smaller than the old City God Temple, and it was soon possible to walk around it in a circle. The tourists outside continued to squeeze in. The liveliness enticed people not to leave, and prosperity occupied everyone's heart. Squid, toys, and rings still sucked out the money hidden in pockets like magnets. Who ever bothered to discern what kind of goods these were? Who ever thought about the people on the starvation line outside the temple?</p>
<p>Stepping out of the temple gate, three or four young street wanderers, piled on top of each other, trying to grab the hydrogen balloons flying under the eaves of the temple gate. A small, thin one rushed forward, and everyone fell in a heap.</p>
<p>"Two jiao each!" The shouts clung to their mouths repeatedly. The pain of the fall and the danger were minor matters to them.</p>

<p>— Sang Min</p>
<p>This play, originally named "Pride and Prejudice", is a story that expresses human emotions. If the audience can appreciate it with a calm mind, it will be a rather excellent work. The screenplay is adapted from a novel. The director, Leonard, is known for producing films starring Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. However, apart from "Bitter Sweet", there are no other plays that are truly popular and deeply ingrained in people's hearts.</p>
<p>The theme has plenty of satire but lacks vigor. The humor of the British gentleman cannot be required to have any thorough meaning. The story unfolds in British feudal society, in an old family that emphasizes pedigree. Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Bennet lead their five unmarried daughters in eagerly seeking to marry into aristocratic families. After some light and interesting ripples, each marries a wealthy and capable husband.</p>
<p>The characters focus on Elizabeth, the eldest daughter played by Greer Garson, and Mr. Darcy, the aristocratic young man played by Laurence Olivier. One has the arrogant air of an aristocrat, and the other has the prejudice of resentment and revenge. They are ultimately able to discard arrogance and prejudice and see the love in their hearts. However, this love is still built on the gentleman system. For example, the section on spending money to bring people together is not as insightful in its explanation of love as the American perspective.</p>
<p>Both leading actors are typical excellent actors. Garson excels in gentleness and beauty, while Olivier has a strong and forceful air. They have a firm grasp of the characters in the play, which is naturally what one would expect. The other roles, such as Edmund Gwenn as Mr. Bennet, Mary Boland as Mrs. Bennet, Ann Revere as Lady Catherine, and Maureen O'Sullivan as the second daughter Jane, are also played very well.</p>
<p>The director and screenplay both develop from the perspective of human sentiment. The unreasonableness of aristocratic society and feudal society is limited to satire, with no intention of negation. The technique is quite delicate, focusing on small details, which is an unavoidable method for human sentiment plays. This film is well made. At least, compared to the same director's recent work "New Moon", it shows more skill.</p>

<p>Confucius, this prophet of mankind, warrior in the darkness, and model for all ages!</p>
<p>"Rectify the heart, be sincere in intentions, cultivate oneself, regulate the family, govern the state, and bring peace to the world. Loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace are the foundations for a great man to establish himself." What was correct two thousand years ago is still correct today, two thousand years later. Pushing it forward billions of years, the brilliance of this truth becomes more and more apparent! The Master spoke of benevolence and righteousness and advocated peace, which is known to all. However, his fighting spirit of eliminating violence and suppressing evil, supporting the weak and small, resisting aggression, and refusing to yield until death is still neglected by the general public. It is truly necessary to have a new understanding.</p>
<p>Peace cannot be enjoyed through complacency or achieved through simple appeasement. One must have the determination to not compromise, not yield, and seek peace through war in order to strive for true peace. The Master certainly did not like war, but he was not afraid of war either. He even strongly advocated the righteous battle of sacrificing oneself for benevolence and giving up one's life for righteousness. Benevolence and love are the goal, and wisdom and courage are the means. The few brutal oppressors in the world are the obstacles to peace, the public enemies of mankind, and also the great enemies of the Master!</p>
<p>Look! His words and deeds throughout his life were all for the sake of justice and humanity. Traveling around the states, embarking on a journey of thousands of miles, he fought against rebellious ministers and traitors. Writing "The Analects" and composing "The Spring and Autumn Annals," he verbally and in writing condemned the cruel enemy without stopping. Before his death, he earnestly told his disciples who had not yet died, "After my death, there will be you; after your death, there will be thousands upon thousands of descendants." Each word, each tear, shook the hearts of every descendant of the Yellow Emperor!</p>
<p>Listen to him sing: "The mountains and fields are vast, the grass is withered and yellow, running around in all directions, staying in the cold wilderness, eliminating all traitors and chasing away jackals and wolves." With such great spirit and firm will, who can deny that he is not a warrior in the darkness? Therefore, the true spirit of Confucianism does not lie in quiet study but in dynamic practice. Studying "The Four Books" and lecturing on "The Five Classics," being skilled in the Master's learning with a pen, and having conversations filled with the ways of ancient sages and philosophers, for those who keep themselves pure, this is only recognizing the passive side. Only those who can transform the Master's words into actions, uphold the integrity of loyalty to the country, and inherit his spirit of supporting the weak and eliminating violence are worthy of being called believers of Confucianism in the new China and are the new youth that China needs. Remember: the Master was not a weak scholar, not an academic who engaged in empty talk, and even less a pedantic idol as commonly imagined. He was a planner with a practical mind, a great patriot, and even more so a vanguard against aggression!</p>
<p>If someone says that China lacks an inherent religion, then undoubtedly, the Master is our great teacher. Striving for the freedom and independence of the motherland is the doctrine that we adhere to and strive to practice. The Master, along with Christ and Buddha, are all saviors of world peace and mankind. Our current war against aggression has implicitly inherited the Master's teachings. On the southeastern border and in the cold wilderness of the north, we have thousands upon thousands of Zilu, galloping across the battlefield, shedding hot blood, throwing away their heads, treading on the bloodstains of the martyrs, vowing to fight to the death and bring peace. The reason why our Chinese nation has not perished and why our culture is immortal lies in this! It lies in this!</p>
<p>Our new and correct understanding of the Master can further strengthen our belief in eliminating violence and suppressing evil. Belief generates strength. It is the new understanding and new belief of 440 million people, this unparalleled great force, that will surely propel the new China onto the bright road!</p>

<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>Since the New Art Troupe performed "Heroes of the Sea," Kuang Mo has been quiet for several months. Recently, he has been preparing for a spring performance. The script has been decided to be Victor Hugo's "Les Misérables."</p>
<p>After Wang Yin directed "Country Girl," because the business was quite good, he was very interested in "doing it again." Xinhua has also agreed, and the date for filming should not be far away. It is heard that the script has also been finalized as an ancient costume film, "Fighting Taiping."</p>
<p>In addition, the play that Wang Yin is privately funding is also actively underway. The script has been decided on as a modern drama, titled "The Soul Returns to Hate Heaven." However, this "The Soul Returns to Hate Heaven" has a different plot from the foreign film "The Soul Returns to Hate Heaven." The only thing that is the same is the title. In terms of actors, Wang Yin is quite keen on inviting Liu Qiong to play the male lead and Yuan Meiyun to co-star.</p>
<p>There is a rumor that Zhang Yuan will publicly sell tickets to allow movie fans to visit the filming. This is actually just a rumor because the actors may not be willing to agree. Moreover, too many visitors during actual filming would cause many inconveniences.</p>
<p>It is heard that Minhua's "Song of Ancient China" includes many Peking operas, and "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan" is only one of them.</p>
<h3 id="e91">"Red Plum Troupe" Performance "The Liberation of Women" <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow (Thursday), the Lafayette Theatre will be hosting two shows, day and night, of "The Liberation of Women" performed by the "Red Plum Troupe." Starting on the 10th, they will continue to perform "Home." The "Red Plum Troupe" is a new and unique troupe, composed of amateur theater people who are passionate and interested in drama, especially women in freelance professions. It is heard that this performance is purely voluntary and is being performed to raise funds for the women's volunteer supplementary school. "The Liberation of Women" is directed by Mr. Hu Dao. The female lead is a female lawyer who speaks very fluent Beijing dialect. She is enthusiastic about voluntary education and advocates for the liberation of women, speaking from her own experience. Famous Shanghai theater actors such as Li Bangzuo, Wang Jixu, Dai Yun, and Yao Zhai are assisting in the performance. It is truly a grand event in the theatrical world.</p>
