<h3 id="c6">平準基金之運用 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>懸懸淤法幣前途者，而今當可更得一明確之信念，即中國外匯平準基金會美方委員福克斯之言曰：「貨幣協定之目的、乃在穩固法幣折合美元之匯率，渠信平準基金，將爲增進凡參加與便利中國維持或擴張其對外貿易之各國幸福之重要因素，且將爲中國內部復興之有價値工具。」</p>
<p>夫今日之對外匯市市其唯一之對象爲何，美匯是也；法幣與美元間之匯率，既得穩固，亦即法幣基礎隨以鞏固之一證。惟穩固至如何程度，事關國策，無從臆測，但可信其至小限度，當不致每况愈下，終必維持相當水準；否則匯價小安定，貿易非獨不能擴張，亦目無法維持。况欲促進中外間貿易，不僅穩定匯價一端，而匯價之得穩定，又恃貿易於中調劑。今則中外貿易間之障礙重重，內地物產不得外運，外來貨物不得內銷，已失懋遷有無之道。即使得能裝運，又是一手包辦，利權獨吞，欲分杯羹而不得，更何有自由發展之可言？雖云「平準基金協定，係英美兩民主國合作運動之一部分，英美兩國係在多方面合作，以保存基本自由。」若貿易障礙小撤除，即此「基本自由」，依然在虛無鏢緲間。</p>
<p>調劑外匯之難在難在高又不是低又不許。雖必需品之輸入，經中國政府核准者，得依法申請法定外匯之權利。然如目前之匯價，已足搖惑一般之人心，再縮，固不僅予生活上更嚴重之威脅，亦且於法幣信念，創痛殊深。長則民生得稍沾便利，而受實惠者又另有人在。夫毒蛇螫手，壯士斷腕。今則附骨之疽，有非刀圭小爲功。然而現狀如斯，事實如彼，得無類於美汽油之揮日，五倍於已往之五年，而美官力之評論此舉，猶謂爲「綏靖政策之一部分，將予日本一錯誤的安全觀念」者非歟！</p>
<p>姑不論英美內心之爲如何：上海之黑匯，終必以顧全友邦對華貿易爲理由，而照常予以維持，仍將由匯豐，麥加利，花旗等銀行合作辦理，此必然之勢也。但期無忘中國之外匯平準基金，得之不易，且大部分向英美羅借而來；幸弗慷他人之慨，用於所不當用，所不必用，直以爲壇玷周旋肆應之工具，而陷中國於負担愈重應付愈艱之危境，想非寄同情於中國之英美人士所願出此也。况夫戰後之經濟組織，必有澈底澄淸重行改造之一日，此非僅以艾登赫爾之言爲依據，蓋大所趨，人各私其私，便其便，則和氣小能致，怨恚不能平，終必釀成異日之大患。即如由遠東戰事而引起二次歐戰，正爲第一次歐戰後之處理，惟强者之馬首是瞻，顏色是承，扶強抑弱，不得其平之過也。甚望此次中國平準基金之運用，實行其「爲中國內部復興之有價値工具」，並爲未來經濟改造中之一種新因素也可！</p>

<p>— 余新恩</p>
<p>第二派是自己相信不會生病的，所以不必爲了健康多去顧慮。但是世界上的事情，可惜不全是這樣簡單的。得病同病的轉重，並不一定讓你覺得或是有什麽預兆的。好比心臟病，肺癆病，糖尿病，腎臟病，腦充血，癌病等等，往往不使我們查覺或是有什麽預兆的。等到一旦發覺了，當時在治療上已經晚了，因此也就在不知不覺中，將我們提前了歸束，以致大好的事業不能完成。這全因爲我們對於健康的觀點有了錯誤，以爲不覺得什麽或是沒有什麼現象就認爲是健康了。果然有的眞是這樣，祇可惜不全是這樣。</p>
<p>那末我們有什麼刀法，劉於我們的健康能多有一層保障而艾最合乎經濟呢？的略的講來，可分爲下面兩種：</p>
<p>第一種：是要我們多多利用自然環境的優點來保持及促進我們的健康。要多與大自然接近。新鮮的空氣，美麗的日光，是極有益於人身的。所以應多有戶外運動，好好的鍛練身體。生活要有規則，工作完畢要多事休息，不要以已疲乏的身心，再去消磨在一切不合於健康的道上，以致身心更加疲弱。又要多多利用天然的滋養食物，像奶油，荳，麥，雞蛋，靑菜，果蔬，魚肉等等，這全都是富於營養而有益於我們身心的。我們不一定要吃人參燕窩，因爲滋補的食品，在大自然裏有的是許多，所以也並不很費的。這也同太陽一樣，不都是有錢人才始能享到</p>
<p>第二種方法，就是要未雨綢繆來防備疾病　中提前了我們的崩潰。目前雖自以爲是好身體，或只看外表來斷定健康是小可靠的。記得從前一個醫學校裏，在新生入學的時候，都要經過很嚴格的身體檢查，每個新生也都要照過X光，看肺部的情狀如何。有一次在一班新生中檢查的結果，有一個學生被查出有很嚴重的肺癆病。但在宣告之前，大家都在担心事，都以爲自已就是這個不幸者，允其是那些生得矮小的，瘦瘦的。結果呢？却是一班中一個長得最高大的，最魁梧的，最胖的，外表最神氣的學生。所以不能全看外表來斷定一個人的健康，事實上運動員得肺病的也並不少。所以最妥當的辦法是要有期限的作一次澈底的身體檢騐，使那些無明顯病微的疾病，可以早被查出，即能施以適當治療。人的生命所以這樣短促，都是爲了平時沒有注意到疾病在暗中將我們摧毀了。有期的身體檢查，可以防止這種弊害，所費有限，而在時間上，幾個月檢查身體一次，比去看一次電影的時間還要省得多。這較疾病沉重之時，再來問醫吃藥，化上許多金錢也無生望，豈不經濟得多嗎？</p>
<p>所以歸納起來，在這生活程度達到最高潮的時候，我們不當只爲了米，麥，柴，煤等生活上的問題打算，而忽略了我們自身更重要更有關的健康問題。因爲犧牲了健康去換取米，麥，柴，煤，或者沒有健康，而單獨有米，麥，柴，煤，是沒有什麽意義的。當要爲我們的前途，爲我們的事業，爲我們的工作，爲我們的經濟打算，那未健康這問題就不是可以暫時擱起來的：更不是靠着旁人來推行幾種運動暫時的興奮一下就可以解決的。最要的是自己的覺悟，自己感到它有切膚的重要，將它培植在日常的生活習慣中，這樣才是最合乎意義同經濟的原素了。因爲保持一個人的健康，所費是很有限的，但是有了健康，所能換來的快樂，工作，事業，幸福，它們的價値實在是不可限量的。</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>譬如唐人萬震所作南州異物志上就很淸楚的說：『木綿，吉貝所生。……』這不是很分明的說吉貝是植物，是樹，木綿是同絲棉有別的棉花　？然而吉貝是外國話，平常人聽了是茫然莫明其妙的：於是自然而然的「吉貝樹」變成了叫人容易領悟的「木綿樹；」再進一步，木綿樹也被削足適履的把綿字改成「棉」字變成了「木棉樹；」更往後、，樹字可省變成「木棉」木字亦可删直呼之爲「棉！」於是進化之手續完成，棉遂成了這種植物的本名了！這話並非憑空揑造，我們但看棉字不見於　雅，說文，和　名等古字書，而是首次發現於陳梁時人顧野王所著的玉篇就可明瞭：這時原正是這種植物輸入中國正盛的時候啊！况說　更證之於其他外國特產傳入中國的情形：其初商譯其音，稍後兼稱其久，　後造　字、以名之，譬如菸草之爲淡巴菰，爲烟草、爲菸，—我國原有之菸字何嘗作此解？—和現在一總的化學名詞！就更可明瞭這種進化演變、是自有它的按步就班絲毫不可紊亂的階段和步驟的了。</p>
<p>棉有木本草本兩；本本的原產地是印度，能長到一丈七八尺高；草本的祖國是埃及或阿拉伯，只有三尺高。有的植物學家以爲它們本是一種：在熱帶地方長成樹狀，可是一遷移到溫帶，則爲適應環境的緣故變成草本。無論怎樣吧，我國古人因爲囿於習見的草本棉，又因爲有冒牌的「攀枝花」——它也冒稱「木棉，」能長到八九丈高，同木本的棉毫無關係。——來魚目混珠，所以對前人稱吉貝爲「樹」是遲疑不人憑信的。如梧　雜佩上說：「木綿，花色深紅，類山茶，……結子大如酒杯，絮吐於口，茸茸如細罷。舊云海南蠻人織爲布……今第以充祵褥，……未有以治爲布者』。徐文定公也說:『吉貝……故是草木，……攀枝花中作祵褥，雖柔滑而不韌，絕不能牽引，豈堪作布？……』這完全是誤把我們現在用以填充枕頭的那種木棉（攀枝花）當成前人所記能够抽緒織布的那吉貝所生的棉花了。就是第一次在正史上標舉吉貝名目的李延壽，他在林邑國傳上很　楚的說：『林邑國出吉貝，吉貝者，「樹」名也。花成時如鵝　，抽其緒紡之以作布，與紵布不殊。』可是他在高昌國傳上，却不敢稱進吉貝的名字，但說：『有草，實如　，中有　綿，綿中有子，……爲細　，名白　子。』或者他也有點疑慮，不敢　下斷語認它們是有血統的關係吧。明人李時琛　存　說；祗有宋朝名儈　雲在翻譯名義集上，一口斷定它們的同族關係說：『刦貝，即木綿也。　賓國大者成樹，此形小，狀如土葵，有殼，剖以出花，如柳絮，可紉爲布。』</p>
<p>棉的祖國，既然是在印度，而印度同我國是那麽比隣相望，可是這衣被羣生的寳貴植物，自從公元前二十三世紀中，經由「島夷」的偶一貢獻和我們結了一面之緣　，便又和我們斷絕來往，却一直等到公元後三四世紀中繼又慨然惠臨申國：眞不禁要叫我們生「何姍姍其來遲」的感想了！現在把我們和它逐步結交的經過簡述於下。</p>
<p>禹貢篇所稱，已引於前。此後直到三國時，有一個注漢書的孟康纔告訴我們說：『閩人以木綿島吉貝。』梁書武帝本紀稱述帝的節儉說：『帝身衣布衣，「木綿」皂帳；一冠三載，一被二年。』可見這時利用它的範圍，已惟廣到長江下游。從李延壽南史的高昌國傳，可以知道同時，我國新疆省已竟有棉。的栽培，唐人萬震在所作南州異物志上說：『木綿，吉貝所生，熟時如鵝　，……核如珠珣用之則治出其核；昔用「輾軸」，今用「攪車」，尤便』。可見他已注意到製棉工具的步。至於作過蘇東坡弟兄的老師，也是眉山人名叫史炤的，解釋通鑑上的吉貝說：「二三月種，秋生黃花，結實，熟時皮裂，綻出如綿，以鐵鋌碾去　核，　竹爲弓，傘弦彈細，卷爲筒，就車紡之，自然抽緒。』這對於舊時製棉的手續，描述的是多麽細貼和濟楚啊！</p>
<p>然而尤其値得我們感恩懷德，應該在這裏人書特書的，却是傳播棉花的大功臣上海人「黃道婆。」　上海縣志記述明人張之象云：『黃道婆，本鎮——烏泥涇——人，初淪　崖州；元貞間（二九五），附海舶歸，携閩廣木棉種之，紡織爲布，州里宗之，業頗富鐃。……』記戰這事尤其淸楚的，當然還是元人陶宗儀的輟耕錄：『閩廣多種木棉，紡織爲布，名曰吉貝。松江府東去五十里許，曰烏泥涇：其地土田碗瘠，民食小給，因謀樹藝以　生業，遂覓種於彼（未完）</p>

<p>— 潘佩英</p>
<p>人生數十年，的有三分之一左右的光陰，化在睡眠裏；因爲人事紛紜，而絕對健康的人又少，故在睡眠中做夢的人極多，而在白天談他自己夢境的人更是在所常見，「夢境」既然時時與人生發生密切關係，似乎並非不値一談，祗是常人談夢，不是怪誕神奇，就是附會袖解，把「夢境」說得玄之又玄，到後來，聽的人同講的人都弄得裏糊塗了。</p>
<p>一般的夢，總是在一半淸楚，一半糢糊的狀態中進行的，十分淸楚的夢兒很少；未過糢糊祗管糢糊，如用另外一種目光去看夢，便能發覺夢有以下各種特性：</p>
<p>予盾性——凡實際上不可能的事，夢中都會變成可能。對於機械學一無所知的人，夢中會駕駛飛機；沒有音樂技能的人，夢中會大吹洋喇叭，這種事情豈不矛盾之至。</p>
<p>混亂性——有條有理的夢罕有，多半的夢都是非常混亂的。原來在陪朋友散步的，忽然自己坐在火車裏了，不多一會，親屬們又和自己在家裏談天了，怎樣上火車和怎樣回到家裏去的，都是突然的改變，沒有什麽理由可以說出來。</p>
<p>複雜性——白天做事，如吃飯寫信，總是一件一件的幹的，夢中的人似乎是萬能的，一個人同時可做許多事，而這許多事一件也未完成的時候，自已又換了一塊地方在做別的許多事情了。顚顚倒倒，複雜已極。</p>
<p>錯綜性——鄰家的小鷄飛進了我的帽子啊，弟弟用我的錢在請人家吃冰汽水啊，諸如此類，七纏八纏，東拉西扯的事情，夢中最多。</p>
<p>此外，人的個性及能力，不會在夢中失去，最顯着的如</p>
<p>夢中的理解力——個人的理解力，夢中照樣存在，且能繼續活動，譬如買書必須付錢；搖船當心落水，這兩種思想，夢中都會有的。</p>
<p>夢中的創造力——創造的能力，夢中也有，畫師能在夢中繪畫，文人會在夢中吟詩，好的詩句及畫稿，醒後往往尙能記憶出來，而眞的留到紙面上去。</p>
<p>夢中的記憶　——故的親友們，恒得在夢中會面，做夢的人常會浮出「他不是早已死了嗎？」的印象來，那時或者人會立刻驚醒，或者仍會身不由主的將夢再做下去。</p>
<p>夢中的恐懼感及習慣性——人的木性，不會在夢中更改。膽小得連老鼠也怕的人，在夢中看見老鼠仍要逃命。同時，愛喝老酒的人，老會做和人一起喝酒的夢；歡喜打架的人，即在夢中也不免要同別人去相打。</p>
<p>怎樣的人，在怎樣的時候，就要做怎樣的夢，夢和各人的年齡及境况都有關係，如能加以硏究，倒也小失爲一件頗有意味的事兒哩。</p>
<h3 id="c104">老而不衰 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>最近十年來，美國的人口增加了有百分之七·二；六十五歲以上的美國人共計增加了二，三二三，四〇一名，佔百分之三十五左右。這些老年紀人，當他（她）們拿到了養老金之後，究竟在幹些什麼，眞是値得我們注意的。據美國聯合情報處的調查，其中大部份人都還是「英俊」得像少年一樣。南加羅里那州却斯德地方有一個女子，年紀已經八十一歲，可還要進大學去硏究天文學；聖田谷也有一位八十一歲的老頭子，就在不久以前完成了單人飛行的偉舉；費城有一個九十一歲的運動員，一天到晚還是在計開爾河上作划舟遊戲；加利福尼亞州西明斯德有一個男子以斫樹這劇烈的工作來作他自己慶祝一百十五歲生辰的節目。</p>
<p>由此說來，一個勤於工作的人是未不會說『已經老了，已經不中用了！』之類的話的。年靑人看了當然應該更加奮發，更加努力！</p>

<h3 id="c105">進化的目覩 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 勞神</p>
<p>生物的進化是非常遲綏而久遠的，譬如從爬虫類進化到烏類，從五趾的馬進化到單趾的馬，從原始人類進化到現代的人類，其間都經過億兆年的時間。因此生物學家現在只能找出些相當可靠的證據，推斷這種現象的存在，但是却沒法目覩這種現象的進行。</p>
<p>最　在美國加州農　試騐塲中，我們居然能看到進化的一幕了。這是試騐殺虫藥時無意發現的。當園丁用劇毒的藥粉噴酒到花卉或蔬菜上時，其中寄生的害虫理該全數殲滅的。但是出於意外，久而久之，這種毒藥的效力漸漸减低了，原來毒藥對虫卵並不能澈底剿滅，新生的虫子虫孫在惡劣的環境中堅苦地磨練，竟獲得了抵抗毒藥的靭力，結果演愛成更强勁的新種。</p>
<p>二十五年以前，紐的大學的米蘭段敎授早有先見之明，他曾預言植物的害虫將　常用的毒藥發生漸得的抵抗性，道種學說在當時因爲沒有事實的根據，各地學者無不斥爲妄談。不料現在竟有應騐的天。而且事情不祇那樣簡單，加州的農　化學家發現害虫地一種毒藥發生抵抗力後，同時對他種毒藥竟也有了同樣的防毒性。蘋果樹上的幼虫獲得抗拒砒化合物的能力後，倘若改用除虫菊也不能損及牠的毫髪了。更糟的是害虫原來只能在某種植物上生活的，現在變種之後，牠們活動的範圍更擴到別種的植物上去；因此蘋果樹上的蛾幼虫一變而成胡桃樹上的害虫了。這眞所謂是『道高一尺，魔高一丈。』倘若人類對牠們的逼迫也可以說是一種天然的淘汰力，那麽牠們這樣微弱的生命奮鬥圖存的力量眞太可驚了。</p>
<p>但是人類當然也是不甘示弱的，科學家正在繼續硏究更有效的除虫藥，非到最後勝利決不終止。這是一塲長期的戰爭，農作物害虫使我們每年遭受無量數價値的損失，牠是我們眞正的敵人。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（九）一個古怪的荘稼人</p>
<p>秋海棠來不及回話，忙打茶缸裏舀起一碗半黃半黑的凉茶來，做一口喝了下去，頭頸裏那幾條漲起着的靑筋，這才縮退了些。</p>
<p>「狗子今兒有事回去啦！早上收的幾籮荳，王四一個人也抬不回來啊！」他把上身那件藍布大褂的領口略略鬆開了些；儘管做了兩三年的莊稼人，要他坦胸露臂，却還有些不慣。「讓我練練筋骨也是好的。」他微笑着說。</p>
<p>吳大跟王四抬着一籮豆，已折往東邊的屋子裏去了。</p>
<p>「我早告訴你兩個活計是不够的，春天你偏要把那個張癩痢打發走，其實家裹也不短一個人的吃喝！」吳大的聲音在門的那一邊響着，很有幾分埋怨的意思。</p>
<p>秋海棠放下茶碗，默默地苦笑了一笑。</p>
<p>其實他的所以要把張癩痢打發走，原不是爲了想省一個人的吃喝，實際上他裏也有他的苦衷。因爲這李家莊原是一個很小的村落，十家倒有几家都是生活很艱苦的窮人：秋海棠帶着他女兒回來的時候，雖不是肥馬輕裘，僕從如雲，但看在那些窮人的眼裏，却已十足像個土財主了，因此後來就有許多親戚上門來告貸。恰好碰到秋海棠又是向來慷慨慣了的，聽他們說得可憐，便不問張三李四，來一個答應一個。吳老爹子起初因爲他才回到鄉裏，親戚鄰舍不能不結交，所以也並不攔阻；到後來眼看向無瓜葛的人也紛紛上門來找他姪兒了。（一二八）</p>

<p>— 旭初</p>
<p>最沂于伶的新作「恩與怨」已在璇宮劇院上演。一向于伶所寫的話劇如花濺淚，女子公寓，女兒國都是傾向於儒林外史型的，寫的是社會的複雜面，幾件事混合在一起寫，不是簡單的獨一的故事。似大明英烈傳却改變了作風，傾向於結構的單純和緊湊。現在的恩與怨也是這樣的，眞是「悲壯，凄凉，激昂，尖銳，緊張，刺激，」確是一部好戲。爲了不願有悲哀，或缺憾的結束，吳琛使得周軍閥與那想要除掉他的紅舞女同歸於盡，不讓周　閥獨生，這樣的改動可說是從悲觀的到樂觀的，從　極的到積極的，正如以前上海銀行職員演吳天的獨慕劇更改劇情一樣。我們也許　說計畫失敗，可以引起我們深思感歎，留下餘味；團圓性的成功以後觀　便帶着滿意回去，不再爲這事而思索了。但是，是吾每個觀衆都能這樣呢？對於看過就完了的人們，最好還是給他們興奮，勝過失望和頹唐。</p>
<p>這部戲不僅編得好，也演得好。慕容婉兒的林娜非常機警，仇銓的周福祥極爲陰險狠毒，王薇的小香又楚楚可憐，冷山的吳斌　像頭傻腦，悟空的勤務兵是嘻皮笑臉，冷靜的吳母是糊塗卑下，都能各自刻劃其個性。由於第四幕即末幕台下掌聲之多，可見觀衆是多末感動，也可見此劇的涵義是多末的深切。即就通俗的或趣味的觀點來看，女間諜的鈎心鬥角，假情假義，也是極有戲劇性的。</p>
<p>爲了求全責備起見，似乎有三個小地方可以商榷：第慕吳斌說他的愛人「只有一個是你，」在「個」字處應稍停頓，不應連續；倘能改作「只有一個，那就是你，」更佳。第叫幕小香背着窗子回小姐說話，不曾回過頭去，就說「咦，小姐你看那火堆，」似乎腦後有眼睛；應該先回身看窗外，再回過來向小姐說「咦」。還有就是第四慕的天幕拉得不緊，太縐了；檯燈也放得不牢，曾跌在地上兩次。但這些小地方很容易的可以改好的。一般地看來，此戲是天風劇社成緒最好的一個戲，（勝過以前的幾個；）最難得的就是極有價値與意義。</p>

<p>不久前，她曾到香港去會了一次程步高，但未幾又向滬，現在，她又要到香港去了，並且，已定令日乘輪啟程，此去不但將與上海作一長別，而且與電影界也宣告脫離。</p>
<p>前天記者會晤談瑛於其寓所，——姚主敎路茂齡　邨，據她說：這次所以脫離電影界的原因，一方面是因爲自己體力衰弱，且患眼病，上次去港本不擬返滬，後因眼病發作，所以特地回滬療治，現在雖已痊好，但醫生關照，令後不能再在强烈的水銀燈下工作，否則眼病將永達不能恢復健康。另一方面，她表示：對於上海的電影界也太感失望，題材，意識，一切都受了環境的脅迫，使人透不過氣來，再者，自已幹了十年來的電影工作，應該退休。爲此種種，所以決定擺脫這銀幕生涯，順道過港赴星加披去休養，好在外干步高改行經商後，境遇也比前優越多了。</p>

<p>許靖道：「這事我也做得有些孟浪，但爲對於于永泰仍是一片好心，這也許可以得到他的諒解的。大槪他對於道一雙狗男女一定小會輕恕的了。還有周將眾那邊的刺客未知下落如何？據王永泰之言，大槪周將軍也不至於遭賊子毒手的。少停我要同賢弟冉往城裏去走一趟，不要使他老人家望穿秋水，說我們爽的。柳隱　道：「很好；吃了早飯，小弟就陪靖哥去城中一行。今天不妨禀明了我的姑母便沒有問題了」。二人談了一刻，柳隱　的姑母早在外邊差小婢來請吃早飯了。許靖就和柳隱央到外邊客堂裹同用早餐。柳隱英回到他房中去，許靖也去換上一件白羅單衫，在庭中小立，看着各種花朵，小婢拿着剪刀在那裏修剪。柳隱火輕輕地從背後走來，換了一件淡靑長衫，戴上紗巾，手搖紈扇，更見得斯文。帶笑說道：「靖哥，我已禀知姑母，許我陪你下山走一遭，現在可請同往」。許靖大喜，立即入室，也換了一頂頭巾，佩上赤鳳劍，快快活活的和柳隱英去告辭出門。柳隱英的姑母可嚀柳隱　早去早回，不要喝酒。小婢也帶笑說公子早早回家，不要在外逗留，免得老夫人盼望。柳隱英答應一聲，和許靖一同走出家門，信步下山。二人一路走一路賞玩山景，沒有昨晚那樣的來去忽忽。許靖瞧着柳隱　儒雅斯文，大有珠玉在前，自慚形穢　槪。又對柳隱央說道。「這裏的狼甚多，昨夜我們往返，幸尙沒有被羣狼包圍呢」。柳隱英道：「狼出來的時候往往在明月之夜，他們容易找到要吃的東西。有時夜間很安靜，有時日間也要成羣而出，這是說小定的。（八五）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Syria and Lebanon: Allied Forces Continue Northward Advance, Occupying Deraa and Approaching Damascus, Another Route Advancing Towards Beirut Coast <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Vichy: The Army Department issued a battle report stating, "British troops and troops belonging to the De Gaulle faction, this morning, launched an attack on Syria and Lebanon from Palestine and elsewhere. According to initial reports, British heavy motorized units and mechanized units, under the cover of artillery fire, crossed the Syrian border and advanced along the highway, attempting to directly contain the city of Damascus. Our officers and soldiers were not surprised by this unreasonable attack by the British and De Gaulle faction troops, and all bravely carried out their duties, resisting them. Heavy fighting is still ongoing. A British fleet, including one battleship, two cruisers, and five destroyers, was originally patrolling south of Beirut. This morning, a small unit of British troops landed on the Lebanese coast and was immediately captured by our troops. In addition, British aircraft continuously bombed the airfields of Damascus and Aleppo and strafed the Laiyet airfield with machine guns." (8th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Judging from reports from various sources, the Allied forces are advancing directly north to reach the railway leading to Damascus. This road is 60 miles north of the railway. On Sunday morning, the Allied forces had already advanced 20 miles. There are rumors from Transjordan or Iraq that troops are advancing to flank Koumous, 80 miles further north. Germans in Tripoli and Beirut will be in an extremely unpleasant situation, as communication between these two places and other parts of Syria will be cut off. It is expected that another army will advance along the coastal highway from Acre to Beirut. If there is no resistance, these places can all be taken into the control of the Allied forces within 24 hours. However, the Allied forces' advance will certainly not stop there and will continue to swiftly move to the northern border and occupy the entire coast of Syria. The Syrian people and most French soldiers will lean towards the Free French forces, and there will be no serious fighting. However, if the Allied forces encounter resistance, they will have to deal with it and will not be able to secure Syria. The reason is that Syria is the location of many airfields and more airfields can be quickly built. By stationing air forces here, the Allied forces can guarantee the safety of Cyprus, preventing a repeat of Crete, and can strengthen the naval position of Alexandria, consolidate the Suez Canal route, and prevent Turkey from being surrounded. (9th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to Vichy news, another British army, starting from Iraq, followed the Euphrates River into Syria. (9th, Reuters regular dispatch) Cairo: Responsible parties announced that Allied forces in Syria have entered Deraa, in the Jebel Druze region, after crossing the Transjordanian border. These troops entered Tyre, on the coast of Lebanon, on Sunday afternoon. Mejdeloun, to the east of that location, has also been occupied. It seems there is little doubt that the Allied forces will encounter some resistance. (9th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Mechanized units crossed the Syrian border yesterday morning and attacked the main bases in Beirut and Damascus, aiming to expel the German troops entrenched there. At the same time, British aircraft dropped leaflets declaring Syria and Lebanon to be "free and independent states," with the goal of achieving a bloodless conquest. This offensive began at 2:00 AM on Sunday and included Free French, Australian, British, Indian, and other Imperial troops. It is reported that a division has already broken through the Palestinian border into Lebanon, advancing towards Beirut, 75 miles away. Another division on the eastern front is advancing from the capital of Transjordan, through the desert, towards Damascus. (9th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to highly reliable unofficial sources, Allied troops in Syria, having entered Deraa early yesterday morning and Tyre in the evening, are continuing to advance north. It is currently difficult to estimate the extent of French resistance. However, French officials in the areas already occupied by the Allies are cooperating with the Allies. (9th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Jerusalem: According to the latest news, the troops entering Syria have not encountered significant resistance so far, but the constant movement of aircraft proves that the British Air Force is currently engaged in major operations. (9th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to a dispatch from the New York Times correspondent in Xiongcheng, 4,000 French troops with modern equipment have joined the British forces in the Jebel Druze region. (9th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to another report from Ankara, all communication between Syria and Turkey has been cut off. (9th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">British Aircraft Bomb Beirut, Two Oil Tanks Hit and Catch Fire <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>London: According to a report from General Dentz, commander of the French forces in Syria, received in Vichy, fierce fighting is underway in the Jebel Druze mountain region, south of Suwayda. Jebel Druze is south of Damascus, 25 miles from the Transjordanian border, and Suwayda is approximately 20 miles from the Syrian-Transjordanian border and about 55 miles southeast of Damascus. General Dentz's headquarters in Beirut issued its first communique, announcing that British forces had attacked the southern edge of Syria and Lebanon, beginning at 3:45 AM on the 8th. French outposts were dutifully defending and engaging the enemy forces. (9th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy: Military sources say that British and Free French forces are currently attacking Syria along a route starting near the Lebanese coast at Maua Yu Mu Erda Jiqian Ertrus, at the southern end. This line is not continuously connected, but the Allied forces plan to advance in divisions at widely spaced locations. According to the second communique issued by General Dentz in Beirut, the British Air Force attacked Beirut, and all the oil depots caught fire. British forces continued to advance south throughout the day. French forces in Syria are now valiantly defending themselves along the entire line, having shot down three enemy aircraft and destroyed several armored vehicles. Beirut was subjected to two air raids, one at 3:30 PM, which was ineffective, and one at 6:30 PM, during which two oil tanks were hit and caught fire. The fire was not intense. The Mezze (near Damascus), Niiras, and Rayak airfields were all bombed, but there was no significant damage. (9th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to the latest reports received here, Allied forces, under the cover of British fighters, are advancing in Syria, encountering little resistance. However, responsible parties have not yet received very accurate information about the situation. German radio is relaying a proclamation from the Vichy government stating that British forces are advancing south. The commander of the Syrian forces is General Wilson, the British commander in Palestine. The Allied forces under his command include British, Australian, and Free French troops. A Middle East communiqué stated that on Sunday morning, Allied forces, under the command of General Wilson, crossed the border into Syria, with the goal of eliminating the German forces in Syria that continue to penetrate and seize key locations. If this is not stopped early, the security of the Allied position in the Middle East will be jeopardized after the establishment of a German base in Syria, and Arab nations will be seized by the Axis powers. It is hoped that the French and Arabs will cooperate in this effort. The Allied forces' advance route is essentially along the coast, through Sidon, towards Beirut. The French have set up several defenses along this route. However, it is not certain whether these are genuine military obstacles or simply structures for managing traffic, as travelers often see in wartime France. The French forces in Syria have had much of their war equipment confiscated by the armistice committee. It is only reported that there are still some tanks and armored vehicles. However, the key is not the war equipment, but the reaction of the people and the French soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Goal of Anglo-French Forces' Entry is to Prevent German Control of Syria <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>A special communiqué issued by the British Air Force in the Middle East regarding air support for Allied operations in Syria stated that at dawn on Sunday, the British Air Force provided complete support to the Allied forces crossing into Syria. British fighters patrolled the skies above the Allied forces and encountered no resistance. It is generally believed that the purpose of the British and French forces' action is to prevent the Germans from controlling Syria and turning it into a battlefield. This objective has essentially been achieved, as there is evidence of gradual German penetration. It is reported that General Dentz, the Vichy representative in Syria, recently received a notification from Vichy that a German mission would arrive in Aleppo around June 15 to take over administrative matters. The seriousness of the German mission's arrival in Aleppo goes without saying. It is also reported that in early May, Vichy Army Minister Huntziger informed Dentz that Deputy Prime Minister Darlan had agreed to hand over Syrian air bases to the Germans during a conversation with Hitler. Although it is not known whether this action will provoke opposition from the army in Syria, it is hoped that everything will be reported for the armistice committee's study. If it is felt that the Syrian army may oppose it, it is hoped that methods will be suggested to eliminate hidden dangers. Dentz replied suggesting that the airfield be used for German troops in transit. The declaration by Britain and the Free French, promising freedom and independence to Syria and Lebanon, is certainly important, but the economic terms in the declaration are also important. Since France surrendered, the economic life of Syria has almost come to a standstill. Exports and imports have both fallen to a minimum, hindered by exchange difficulties. And the oil flowing into Syria through pipelines is no longer available. This Anglo-French declaration promises to restore its economy, remove its exchange difficulties, and give it the opportunity to establish relations with the sterling bloc. Therefore, the Syrian soldiers and civilians who hate Germany and reject Vichy should accept the promise of independence and support the Free French forces in driving the Germans out of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e4">De Gaulle, Wavell, and Others Issue Proclamations to the French Soldiers and Civilians <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>After the Allied forces set out, Free French leader De Gaulle, British Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Archibald Wavell, and Commander of the Free French Forces in the Middle East Georges Catroux, all issued proclamations to the Syrian soldiers and civilians. De Gaulle's proclamation stated, "French soldiers and civilians in the East, both land, sea, and air forces, take up arms to liberate France! The time has come. I have appointed General Catroux as the commander-in-chief of the French forces in the East. You must obey his orders. France will surely be victorious." British Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, General Wavell, issued a proclamation to the French troops in Syria last night, stating, "To the French soldiers and civilians who are my comrades in battle today and will be my comrades in victory tomorrow: We have now received orders to enter Syria. This is the only way to save Syria, at least to prevent the Germans from seizing it. The Germans occupy one-third of France and control the other two-thirds. Now they are also occupying France's colonies. Syria and Lebanon are the first stage of this advance. This is what you are currently witnessing. We have come not as your enemies, but as your helpers, to defend against our common enemy. Do not reject us, but give us your support. Our army is strong. Any resistance is futile." General Wavell also recalled the Allied victory twenty years ago, saying that we will strike the Germans a second blow today, and it is hoped that you will join those who fought side by side last time to do so.

<p>Manila: Dr. Quo Tai-chi, the retired Chinese ambassador to Britain, has arrived here by clipper from the United States, en route to Chongqing to assume the position of Foreign Minister. When the American clipper landed at Cavite, those welcoming Quo included Vargas, the secretary of President Quezon, and Dr. Yang Guang-sheng, the Chinese Consul-General. Quo's arrival was extremely mysterious, as Quo's name was not on the passenger list, and Yang Guang-sheng had stated that Quo would arrive today. According to reliable sources, Quo will fly to Singapore by clipper tomorrow. Dr. Yang Guang-sheng escorted Quo out of the airport without allowing reporters to meet him. (9th, United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>British Actions Praised by the US</p>
<p>Washington: After news of the British attack on Syria was received, the newspapers did not publish anything, but the initial reaction was undoubtedly favorable. The public and newspapers alike praised the British troops' timely actions in Iraq, and there is now widespread support for doing the same thing in Syria before the arrival of large numbers of German troops. Those here believe it is excellent that the Free French forces are fighting alongside the British in the area and eagerly hope that the British troops can completely occupy Syria before the German forces attack.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Operation of the Exchange Stabilization Fund <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Those who are concerned about the future of the legal tender can now gain a clearer understanding. Fox, the American member of the Chinese Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund, stated, "The purpose of the monetary agreement is to stabilize the exchange rate between the legal tender and the US dollar. He believes that the Stabilization Fund will be an important factor in promoting the happiness of all countries participating in and facilitating China's maintenance or expansion of its foreign trade, and it will be a valuable tool for China's internal recovery."</p>
<p>What is the sole target of today's foreign exchange market? It is the US dollar. The stabilization of the exchange rate between the legal tender and the US dollar is proof of the consolidation of the legal tender's foundation. However, to what extent it is stabilized is a matter of national policy, and it is impossible to speculate. But it can be believed that, at a minimum, it will not continue to deteriorate, and it will eventually maintain a reasonable level; otherwise, if the exchange rate is only slightly stable, trade will not only fail to expand, but it will also be impossible to maintain. Moreover, promoting trade between China and foreign countries involves more than just stabilizing the exchange rate, and the stability of the exchange rate depends on trade to mediate. Today, the barriers to trade between China and foreign countries are numerous. Inland products cannot be exported, and foreign goods cannot be sold domestically. The way of exchanging what one has for what one needs has been lost. Even if it is possible to ship goods, it is done by one-stop services, with profits monopolized. It is impossible to share the benefits, let alone have free development. Although it is said that "the Exchange Stabilization Fund Agreement is part of the cooperative movement between the United Kingdom and the United States, two democratic countries, and the United Kingdom and the United States are cooperating in many ways to preserve basic freedom," if the trade barriers are not removed, this "basic freedom" will still be in a state of nothingness.</p>
<p>The difficulty of regulating foreign exchange lies in that it must not be too high and not be too low, and it must not be allowed. Although the import of necessities, approved by the Chinese government, has the right to apply for the statutory foreign exchange according to law. However, the current exchange rate is enough to shake the hearts of the people. Further shrinkage will not only pose a more serious threat to life, but will also deeply wound faith in the legal tender. If it lasts, the people's livelihood can be slightly benefited, but the actual beneficiaries are others. A venomous snake bites the hand, and a brave man cuts off his wrist. Today, it is an attached bone gangrene, and small efforts of medicine are of no avail. However, the current situation is such, the facts are such, is it not similar to the fact that American gasoline is sold to Japan five times more than in the past five years, while American officials comment on this move, saying that it is "part of the appeasement policy, which will give Japan a false sense of security"?</p>
<p>Regardless of what the British and Americans think in their hearts, the Shanghai black market will ultimately be maintained as usual, for the sake of protecting friendly countries' trade with China, and it will still be handled in cooperation by HSBC, Chartered Bank, Citibank, and other banks. This is inevitable. But it is hoped that China's foreign exchange stabilization fund, which was obtained with difficulty and mostly borrowed from the United Kingdom and the United States, will not be forgotten. Hopefully it will not be used to spend other people's money generously, on what should not be used, what does not need to be used, and used as a tool for altar diplomacy, and trap China in an increasingly heavy burden and difficult to deal with situation. This is not what the British and American people who sympathize with China would want. Moreover, the post-war economic organization will inevitably have a day of thorough clarification and reconstruction. This is not only based on the words of Eden and Hull, but because the general trend is that people each pursue their own interests and convenience, so harmony cannot be achieved, grievances cannot be calmed, and it will inevitably lead to great disasters in the future. For example, the Second World War, which was caused by the war in the Far East, was precisely because of the handling of the First World War, which only looked to the strong, obeyed their wishes, and suppressed the weak, which was not fair. It is hoped that the operation of China's stabilization fund this time will truly "be a valuable tool for China's internal recovery" and be a new factor in the future economic reconstruction!</p>

<h3 id="e18">England's Determination to Clarify the Situation: Restore Prestige in the Middle East; Darlan Returns to Paris to Confer with Germany; France Launches Political Offensive Against the Two Nations <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>London: British Imperial overseas troops and Free French forces stormed into Syria and Lebanon yesterday. The future of the British Empire in the Middle East and Near East depends on the success or failure of these troops. If successful, not only will the Suez Canal be safeguarded, but Cyprus Island will also have an important barrier against German attacks, and a strong protective ring will be established against Hitler's ambition to seize Near Eastern oil fields. Politically, this move can repair Britain's damaged prestige in the Middle East and strengthen Turkey's attitude towards Germany. (June 9th, United Press report)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the British military's elimination of German forces in Syria is extremely important, affecting the entire status of the Mediterranean. Britain has no choice but to clarify the situation once and for all, and will not give up until this is achieved. The only criticism that Britain's actions are likely to encounter is that the decision to send troops into Syria was too slow. As for what kind of troops will be used to enter Syria, and what kind of resistance they will encounter, it is still unknown. Estimates of the number of French troops in Syria range from 30,000 to 60,000, but only 15,000 are French. It is widely believed that some French officers, especially those dissatisfied with the complete pro-German policy, are now disloyal. The rest are calling on General Dentz to reinforce with "reliable troops." The escape of a certain officer named Collet into the British lines proves the dissatisfaction among the French troops. Germany is expected to do everything possible to send troops to Syria from the air and even by sea. However, the majority of the Syrian people tend to support General Catroux and the British. They have not only forgotten the ruthlessness of German military tactics in the last war, but also deeply resent the French government's failure to fulfill its solemn promise of complete independence for Syria and Lebanon. General Catroux's announcement and the supplementary declaration issued by the British Ambassador in Egypt on behalf of the British government, guaranteeing the freedom of the people of Syria and Lebanon, should be able to change the attitude of Syrians who are still wavering and hoping that France will fulfill its promises. Because the Syrians all know that Britain completely respects its promises to Egypt and Iraq, and the failure of Ali Gailani's rebellion is also due to the people's trust in British protection. The advance of Free French and British troops into Syria will inevitably cause a reaction from the authorities in occupied France, which is particularly concerning. However, it is doubtful whether Vichy, despite being under strong pressure from Germany, will resort to extremes, because Syria is not only a mandated territory, but also has gained autonomy according to the 1936 treaty. In addition, the Vichy authorities also know that if they take any tough actions, they will not gain any assistance or sympathy from any part of France. Even Darlan himself is now beginning to realize that there are limits he cannot exceed. (June 9th, Reuters report)</p>
<p>London: Rome Radio Station reported that after the news of British and Free French troops entering Syria reached Vichy, Pétain and Darlan immediately held urgent consultations. The Journal de Genève reported that Darlan is now returning to Paris to discuss with Germany. Also, after Weygand returned to North Africa, the acting governors of the French colonies are now returning to their original posts. (June 9th, Reuters report)</p>

<p>Pétain Issues Proclamation to the People</p>
<p>Vichy: After British troops and troops belonging to the Catroux faction invaded Syria and Lebanon this morning, Marshal Pétain issued a proclamation to the people of the two nations and sent it by telegram to General Dentz, the French High Commissioner in Syria and Lebanon. The text reads: "The countries in which you live, and the prosperity that you have painstakingly created over the years, have today become the target of unreasonable attacks. However, the attackers are still French, who have not hesitated to raise the flag of division and, under the protection of British forces, have shed the blood of those who defend the unity of the French Empire and French sovereignty. This is no different from the previous attack on Dakar in French West Africa. Although France has painful impressions of this fact, it is by no means the first to attack its former allies with force, as it was in the past, and as it is now. This is something to be proud of. Before resorting to violence, various conspiracies and tricks were used. For months, the other side has been spreading propaganda as a pretext for invasion, saying that German troops have landed in the ports of the two nations, or that France is preparing to cede the territory of these two nations to Germany. You who are on the ground know that this is all made up. As a matter of fact, although a few planes landed in the territory a few days ago, they have all left except for those that cannot fly. Whether in Syria or Lebanon, there is not a single German soldier. All of this is a fact that you all know. For this reason, the invasion you are suffering this time is something that our conscience cannot ignore. The sovereignty of France in the two nations is under threat, and this is the first time. I hope you can all trust me. In short, we are fighting for justice, and we are fighting to defend the integrity of our territory. You should know how to defend it. The entire France will be with you. (June 8th, Havas report)</p>
<p>Vichy Political Circles Criticize British Invasion</p>
<p>Vichy political figures claim that Britain is willing to be a rogue and invade Syria without any just reason. This is simply continuing Churchill's plan, which is to take advantage of others' difficulties and seize France's colonies while it is suffering greatly. The British are using the pretext of German troops landing in Syria, but they remember that there were no German soldiers in Wollongong when the British attacked the French fleet. There were also no German soldiers in Dakar when they entered and tried to occupy it. As for Gabon, Cameroon, New Caledonia, and Tahiti, there were no German soldiers either, but Britain brazenly invaded them. General Dentz has already stated that there are no German troops in Syria. It is undeniable that a few German planes landed at Syrian airfields on the way to Iraq a few days ago, but at present there are only three or four damaged German planes parked at the Syrian airfield. It is believed that Britain is taking a consistent materialistic stance, trying to deceive the people of Syria and Lebanon with the bait of lifting the blockade of Syria and joining the Sterling bloc. All of this proves that Britain's invasion of Syria is entirely based on its own interests, wanting to compensate for what it has lost in the Near East from France. Another reason is to protect the oil fields of Iraq and preserve the interests of British financial capitalists. This time, Britain's attack on Syria is led by Catroux's troops, but Catroux himself signed an agreement with Churchill, solemnly declaring, "Not to fight against France." Now Catroux is handing Syria and Lebanon over to Britain, while falsely claiming to guarantee the independence of the two nations to deceive the local people. He is truly a sinner against France and Syria. Previously, Britain bombed the airfield in Syria because German planes had landed there, but the French government did not consider it an act of aggression. However, this time it has gone even further, and has already launched an armed invasion, which is clearly a hostile act of infringing on French sovereignty. In short, the French government is now watching the evolution of the situation and is dealing with it with great calm. (June 8th, Havas report)</p>

<p>Vichy: The French official news agency Petit Journal published an article describing the Syrian-Lebanese border defense in detail. It stated that the border extends over 1,000 kilometers from Ras al-Naqoura on the Syrian border to near Yesh Resh-Ibin-Omar on the Turkish border. The neighboring countries are Palestine, Transjordan, and Iraq. Depending on the terrain, the above-mentioned border can be divided into four sections. The first section is between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan Valley, with many mountains, but the peaks are not very high, with those over 600 meters above sea level. This section is currently quiet as usual. The second section is east of the mountains, near the Jordan Valley, where many solid fortresses have been built. The most important fortress is Qal'at, which controls the vital thoroughfares, one from Tiberias to Syria and the other from Tiberias to Damascus. According to British reports, British troops will be active in this section. The third section extends from the east of the Sea of Tiberias to the Euphrates River. This section of the border is 500 kilometers long, almost a straight line. There is a vital fortress, Jabal al-Druze, which is 130 kilometers from Damascus. British reports indicate that fighting has occurred in this section, which other reports have also mentioned. The fourth section extends between the Euphrates River and the Tigris River, passing through 300 kilometers of flat desert. The fortresses of Palmyra and Al-Adiel are both located on the river. According to British reports, troops are approaching Al-Adiel (Father of Deir ez-Zor). (June 9th, Agence Havas report)</p>

Turkish officials are currently refusing to comment on the situation in Syria, and are only closely watching its development.

<p>Ankara: The British and Free French advance into Syria has aroused excitement throughout Turkey, but the government has long anticipated this move and has stated that Turkey will not take any active steps. Officials declared that this advance is the first test of the extent of Franco-German cooperation. At the same time, if the advance is successful, Catroux will have the opportunity to enhance the prestige of Free France throughout the French Empire. Well-informed diplomatic sources said that Germany now has sufficient reasons to send troops to Tunisia, Morocco, and Dakar. Similarly, Berlin can also demand that Vichy order the French fleet to join the war against Britain. (June 9th, United Press report)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Well-informed sources here are currently wondering whether Germany's provocations in Syria are intended to divert British attention so that it can launch a major attack on Egypt from Libya. It is said that if Germany uses planes to transport troops to Syria, it will not withstand the blow of British heavy tank forces there, and it is extremely difficult for Germany to supply German troops in Syria because there are many British air force bases nearby. Therefore, Britain should seize Syria as soon as possible before Germany completes its preparations for an attack from Libya. Turkey's own situation has improved due to the German troops withdrawing from Greece and Bulgaria to Moldavia. Military experts believe that it will take at least a month for Germany to redeploy troops back into Greece and Bulgaria to reach its previous strength. (June 9th, Reuters report)</p>

<p>Berlin: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that Germany views the military actions in Syria and attaches greater importance to the political announcements there, but refused to explain Germany's attitude towards Syria.

Therefore, France is exercising its sacred right to protect the country. The troops of the so-called "Free France" are mostly colonial troops. According to the latest news, French troops are resisting stubbornly, but the Syrian war is a conflict between Britain and France. France does not have a single German soldier in Syria.

<h3 id="e31">British Naval Strength is Immense and Cannot Be Conquered by Germany; Even if Unhappily Forced to Withdraw from the Mediterranean, It Can Still Go to America to Continue to Deal with Germany <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>New York – Britain may fail in the Mediterranean, and even the homeland may be attacked, but the Empire will not fail. The British Empire is strong, and its navy is extremely powerful, so it will never be easily conquered by Hitler. America's assessment of the impact of the Mediterranean war and the general outcome is perhaps overly pessimistic. As President Roosevelt pointed out, even if Britain has lost control of the Mediterranean, allowing German vehicles to freely cross the Mediterranean and enter Africa, or even if the homeland has been invaded, the British fleet can still cross the Atlantic to America and will not be seriously hindered by the Axis navy. It can then operate from Canadian or American ports. If Britain is forced to withdraw from the Mediterranean, Admiral Cunningham can lead his fleet to Britain. If Britain has fallen into Hitler's hands, it can go to Singapore or India. Cunningham's fleet, excluding smaller ships, has seven battleships and one battlecruiser. This naval strength is not enough to survive in Singapore, as it may have to contend with a superior Japanese fleet there. However, the United States can certainly send its fleet stationed near Hawaii to reinforce it. If there is no such reinforcement, it is safer for Cunningham to sail to India, as the Japanese naval base is farther away and cannot operate effectively there. Britain has eight battleships and two battlecruisers. If Britain is conquered, these warships can cross the Atlantic. The eastern coast of the United States has only three battleships, but if the situation requires it, the fleet in Hawaii can send two battleships, plus two new North Carolina-class ships, then there will be a total of thirteen battleships and two battlecruisers, which is only enough to defend the western Atlantic. If the ten battleships and one battlecruiser commanded by Cunningham in India decide to go to Singapore, then American battleships can come from Hawaii to reinforce, and then there will be a total of seventeen battleships and one battlecruiser, which is much superior compared to the Japanese fleet in the Far East, so Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and Australia can be free from worries about Japanese naval attacks. At the same time, Hitler will control the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The strength of his fleet, including French and Italian warships, if damaged warships are repaired, is roughly as follows: 17 battleships, 6 battlecruisers, 11 aircraft carriers, 71 cruisers, 293 destroyers, and 380 submarines. This number is only a rough estimate. If Britain has no base in Europe, even if the United States has actively joined the war, it cannot hope to defeat the Axis combined fleet. Conversely, Hitler has no base in the western Atlantic and cannot cope with the American combined fleet except with submarines or aircraft carriers. Hitler's advantage is that he can obtain supplies in the whole of Europe, east to India in Asia, and south to the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. He can use his warships to control the waterways of Europe, the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and most of Africa. He will be cut off by the Anglo-American combined fleet and will not be able to obtain supplies from America and the Far East. In such a war, Hitler will have to fight a long struggle or will give the United States the opportunity to expand its navy, expand its merchant ships, and expand its aviation. This war is a test of strength between democracy and dictatorship, and a test of resources and energy. Hitler must maintain a large number of troops in the occupied areas to prevent resistance. This task is extremely difficult and may prevent Hitler from obtaining the material conveniences he needs in the occupied areas. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry announced yesterday that Royal Air Force bombers heavily attacked Brest in France and Bergen in Norway on Saturday night, bombing dockyards and shipping facilities in both places. Although fog made observation difficult in Brest, the attack was still successful, and the dockyards were hit multiple times. At the same time, the Coastal Air Force also bombed dockyards and ships in Bergen. All British planes returned safely. Intelligence also stated that the British Air Force lost three bombers and one fighter plane while attacking enemy ships off the coasts of Holland and Norway during the day on Saturday.

<p>Alexandria – German planes launched two heavy night attacks on Alexandria yesterday, with small incidents all night. German planes sped past, flying very low, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs over a wide area, causing damage to several places in the city. European and Arab residential areas were heavily damaged, and deaths and injuries may reach hundreds. Several fires broke out and were quickly extinguished. The port area was the most heavily bombed. Anti-aircraft guns of British and Greek warships in the area heavily fired at enemy planes. German planes dodged in the gunfire and dropped bombs, but did not hit warships or military targets. The most intense attack on the area ended near dawn, and the roar of anti-aircraft guns gradually subsided. The Egyptian Ministry of Interior issued a statement saying that the total number of deaths and injuries could not yet be ascertained and that at least one enemy plane was shot down. Furthermore, an official report from Malta stated that several enemy planes attacked civilian houses on the island on Saturday night, causing very little damage and no casualties. An Italian bomber was shot down by a British fighter plane, and another was heavily damaged and unable to return to base. On Sunday morning, enemy planes again approached the coast of Malta but did not launch an attack. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters correspondent with the British fleet in the Mediterranean telegraphed that the Nazi air force now seems to have launched a very urgent air raid on Alexandria, with heavy bombing, and even the suburbs are not spared. German planes are also constantly flying to Alexandria for reconnaissance. One of them was shot down yesterday afternoon. There are no official figures available for the number of deaths and injuries in the recent German attacks on the area, but according to inquiries at various hospitals, the number of deaths and injuries has suddenly increased. Now, Egyptian residents in the city of Alexandria are evacuating one after another, either carrying belongings and children in cars or walking out of the city with luggage. However, rental cars have been requisitioned and are not easy to rent. The train station is extremely crowded with Arabs, rushing to board trains to leave the city, and it is very difficult to get a seat. Many houses are built of brick and mud and were severely damaged after being bombed, especially in the most densely populated slums, but the people do not show signs of panic or disorder, because the German planes are rampant, and hatred for Germany is growing.

<p>London – Officials announced that for three months, the British Air Force has attacked enemy ships from Norway in the north to the Mediterranean in the south during the day. The British bombers that launched the attacks all flew low to drop bombs, sinking a total of 83 Axis ships. The most recent attack was on an enemy supply ship convoy. The ships were hit, caught fire, or sank. British bombers also soared over the coast of Holland, dropping bombs on a German salvage ship off the coast of Terschelling, hitting it and causing it to catch fire. On the return trip, two British planes were intercepted by German fighter planes, leading to a fierce battle, which ended with one German plane being damaged, and the British planes safely returning. Air Marshal Sir Richard Peirse, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief Bomber Command, especially congratulated the bomber pilots. Furthermore, British fighter planes maintained offensive patrols over the Strait of Dover and occupied areas on Sunday. Three British bombers and one fighter plane that went out on patrol during the day on Saturday are missing. The Air Ministry stated that when British planes attacked the German naval base in Brest on Saturday night, they encountered sea fog, making observation difficult, but the attack was still quite successful, with multiple batches of large bombs hitting the dockyards. Coastal planes also attacked dockyards and ships in Bergen that night. No British planes were lost. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Cairo – The latest communiqué from the British Air Force in the Middle East stated that the Axis-occupied base of Benghazi in Libya was bombed by British planes on Friday night, catching fire and turning into a fiery hell.

<p>Tokyo – According to the "Asahi Shimbun," since the expansion of the European war, a certain country has been using the preferential treatment of its embassy to send leaflets and pamphlets to the intellectual circles of major cities such as Kobe and Yokohama, engaging in anti-Axis propaganda. The propaganda defends the attitude taken by a certain country at the beginning of the German-Polish war. Some propaganda materials have been seized by local authorities. Now, various government agencies, in view of the subtlety of this matter, are studying countermeasures, but no concrete decision has yet been made. (Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e43">U.S. Airplane Factory Workers Decide to Continue Strike; The Army Has Been Moved Near the Factory and Will Take Over the Entire Factory and Run It Themselves <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Inglewood – The North American Aviation factory here will reopen at 7:00 AM this morning (Shanghai summer time, Monday midnight). All soldiers are waiting for President Roosevelt's order to take over the factory. Two motorized infantry battalions from the Ninth Military District in San Francisco have camped in Inglewood within three hours. It seems that they are stationed here in accordance with the White House statement that unless aircraft production is resumed today, the military will manage the construction of British and American aircraft worth $191,000,000. North American Aviation announced that the factory may reopen to provide work for those willing to return to work. As for the striking workers at the factory, who are members of the United Automobile Workers Association of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, they announced at the Sunday meeting that they opposed the return-to-work proposal of Frankengustie, the national aviation industry leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Local union leaders further encouraged this opposition. International officials of the United Automobile Workers Union and the Congress of Industrial Organizations, through Frankengustie, have recognized the strike as illegal and have suspended all personnel and negotiating committees of the local union of the North American Company. The factory normally produces a total of 250 fighter planes, bombers, and training planes for Britain and the United States each month. The factory was closed on Thursday because the factory workers opposed the current wage of 50 cents per hour and demanded that the minimum wage per hour be increased by 10 cents. The strike occurred while the company and union authorities were negotiating with the National Defense Mediation Board in Washington. Frankengustie declared, "Returning to work today is not a failure of the strike. This stoppage was caused by the Communist Party taking advantage of the legitimate demands of the North American workers to incite negligence in the national defense process. The Congress of Industrial Organizations believes that the legitimate demands of the workers can be resolved quickly without involving this important national defense factory." A workers' spokesperson said that they would refuse the government's order to return to work, while the Army Department replied that it would take over the factory, and those willing to return to work would be able to return to work without interference. (United Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington – The workers of North American Aviation decided last night to continue the strike despite the U.S. government's threatened actions. President Roosevelt had issued an order that if the workers did not return to work today, the government would take over the North American Company. U.S. Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins issued a final appeal to all workers, requesting them to cooperate with the government. Ms. Perkins said that the millions of people participating in the labor movement all hope that the strikers will put the needs of the country first and resume work as soon as possible.

<p>Chongqing – During the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, the Japanese side repeatedly spread rumors that a certain Chinese army commander and division commander had been killed in battle, that a certain division commander and brigade commander had surrendered, and that a certain chief of staff was missing or captured. These rumors were based on conjecture. If there were any facts to them, the Chinese military spokesman has refuted them. The reporter believes that the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain has now come to an end, and the major battle has shifted to the Taihang Mountains. The Chinese army is fighting the Japanese army, so I specially visited the military spokesman again. According to him, the Japanese side said that the commander-in-chief of the Chinese army, Wan Zhong, had been killed in battle, but in fact, Commander-in-Chief Zeng is still commanding operations on the front line. He said that the Japanese side said that Tan Zhaohan, commander of the Provisional 3rd Brigade of the Chinese 33rd Army, had surrendered, but in fact, the Chinese side not only has no such person, but also has no such number.

<p>Sino-American trade has improved after adjustments. Barter trade and loan agreements have been established successively. China's main native products, such as minerals, tung oil, and bristles, are shipped to the United States in large quantities via the Burma Road and Hong Kong and Shanghai. At the same time, China's necessities, such as machinery tools and vehicles and metals, are continuously transported from the United States to China, enabling the revival of national industries in the free areas, developing mineral production, and constructing the interior. After the establishment of the Sino-American Currency Stabilization Agreement, the exchange rate between Chinese legal currency and the US dollar can be sustained and stable, and legitimate trade between the two countries can continue to develop. This is indeed a blessing for the future of both China and the United States.</p>
<p>Necessary Goods Shipped from America to China</p>
<p>Regarding American goods shipped to China that are necessary, from January to April of this year, American wheat and wheat flour were worth 17,355,229 customs gold units, American cotton was worth 8,442,654 customs gold units, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel were worth 5,839,580 customs gold units, metals and mineral sands were worth 5,110,579 customs gold units, general merchandise was worth 5,151,423 customs gold units, vehicles were worth 4,349,669 customs gold units, and paper was worth 3,430,881 customs gold units. In addition, goods worth more than one million customs gold units but less than two million customs gold units included tobacco, paint, and chemical products. The above goods are all necessary for China.</p>
<p>Main Native Products Shipped Out Continuously</p>
<p>Since the Sino-American barter trade agreement and the loan secured by goods were successively established, China's native products have been continuously shipped to the United States. From January to April of this year, textile fibers (including silk, hemp, cotton, and wool) were worth 67,667,727 national currency units, bristles and hair were worth 37,154,287 national currency units, raw leather, tanned leather, and leather goods were worth 22,900,2503 national currency units, yarn and knitted goods were worth 18,400,8266 national currency units, general merchandise was worth 13,950,848 national currency units, tung oil was worth 11,777,566 national currency units, other textiles were worth 11,555,870 national currency units, and mineral sands were worth 2,186,020 national currency units.</p>
<p>Sino-American Trade Becomes Increasingly Prosperous</p>
<p>Sino-American trade: From January to April of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), imports were 60,051,200 yuan, and exports were 19,356,000 yuan. From January to April of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), imports were 64,857,000 yuan, and exports were 42,199,000 yuan. From January to April of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), imports were 131,468,000 yuan, and exports were 118,751,000 yuan.

<p>The Dutch East Indies' attitude is extremely firm and unwavering. The use of force is feared to destroy the resources needed.</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" published a commentary by Mr. Woodhead on the Dutch East Indies issue yesterday, which stated, "The psychological warfare launched by Tokyo against the Dutch East Indies authorities seems to have reached its peak. In the past two weeks, Japanese newspapers have repeatedly published articles threatening the Dutch East Indies authorities, accusing them of lacking sincerity. Japanese officials have also repeatedly issued warnings, attempting to induce the Dutch East Indies to accept their demands. Although the content and nature of the demands are unknown, since the Dutch East Indies authorities have rejected them, it is believed that these demands must be unacceptable. The Dutch East Indies authorities have clearly stated that their policy of negotiating with Japan is based on two unwavering principles: that they will never engage with the "new order" established by Japan or other countries, and that they are unwilling to transfer any raw materials to Japan that could fall into the hands of the enemy (Germany). The negotiations between the Dutch East Indies and Japan are about trade, and the Dutch East Indies authorities have their own independent judgment on what can be conceded and what must be insisted upon. Considering the results of the "new order" in China and Vietnam, they have gained objective lessons and dare not follow suit. Japan currently has two options for the Dutch East Indies: compromise or use force. However, the result of using force will inevitably destroy the various resources that Japan needs, which is not a good plan."</p>
<h3 id="e52">Shanghai Municipal Council Sends Large Number of Detectives to Investigate Adulteration of Affordable Rice <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Labor representatives of rice shops are making intimidating statements against the sale of inland rice mixed with inferior grains.</p>
<p>Last Saturday, the price of rice of various types slightly increased due to rice weevils. Yesterday, the rice market believed that the price increase from last Saturday could continue. The opening price was high, but local and out-of-town rice merchants had no appetite, and transactions became sluggish. Generally, rice hoarders, seeing that their plans were not working, and with a large amount of stock, were eager to sell, so they had to lower prices. No. 1 Saigon rice fell from 120 yuan per picul to 116 yuan per picul, only two yuan per picul higher than lower grade rice. However, the volume of transactions did not increase much, indicating that the city's reserves were sufficient. With the influx of foreign rice, residents remained calm and were not moved by the rumors of rice hoarders. At the same time, if the concession authorities can strictly prohibit the export of rice, the price of rice in Shanghai will fall further.</p>
<p>Direct Orders Are Futile</p>
<p>Recently, the number of group purchases of rice has increased sharply, with more than 20 locations including the Great World Company. Currently, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. is reviewing each application separately and will announce the results in succession within a few days. It is rumored that people can directly contact Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and pay at designated foreign firms. This rumor is unfounded and not only makes citizens travel back and forth in vain but also undermines the regulations set by the authorities. According to a senior official at Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., yesterday, the Shanghai Power Company wanted to purchase a large quantity of affordable rice for its own use and mistakenly believed this rumor and came to contact them. They were told to purchase it from retail rice shops.</p>
<p>Strict Penalties for Adulteration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council is paying close attention to the quality of the affordable rice sold by each retail rice shop. In addition to sending a large number of detectives to investigate adulteration, the agency in charge of affordable rice also notified various grain stores and rice shops that mud rice swept up from the floor due to torn bags of affordable rice stored in warehouses must not be sold to buyers. Violations will be treated as adulteration.</p>
<p>Labor-Management Dispute Unresolved at Rice Shops</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute in Shanghai's rice shop industry has been ongoing for half a month since it began on the 17th of last month. However, the dispute remained deadlocked yesterday. Although the labor and management sides have held several rounds of consultations midway, there has been no progress because their opinions could not be reconciled. Yesterday, the labor side stated that employees are determined to spare no sacrifice to urge the management to realize the situation. In order to strengthen the fighting force, a strike committee has been organized to deal with emergencies when necessary. If the management does not make concessions, the situation may escalate. It is heard that the authorities are paying close attention to prevent any complications that may cause disturbances.</p>

Among them, the first case is the most important, because after the general salary increase for the council staff last November, it led to a 40% increase in donations, and the budget for this fiscal year is insufficient by 8 million yuan. Therefore, the authorities feel quite difficult about this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Maintaining Your Health (Part 2) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xin'en</p>
<p>The second group believes that they will not get sick, so there is no need to worry too much about health. But unfortunately, things in the world are not always that simple. Getting sick and the worsening of diseases do not necessarily make you feel anything or have any premonitions. For example, heart disease, tuberculosis, diabetes, kidney disease, cerebral hemorrhage, cancer, etc., often do not make us aware or have any premonitions. By the time we discover it, it is already too late for treatment, and therefore, unknowingly, we bring our lives to an end prematurely, so that great careers cannot be completed. This is all because we have the wrong view of health, thinking that if we don't feel anything or have no symptoms, then we are healthy. Indeed, sometimes that is true, but unfortunately not always.</p>
<p>So what methods do we have to provide an extra layer of protection for our health and be the most economical? Briefly speaking, it can be divided into the following two types:</p>
<p>The first is to make full use of the advantages of the natural environment to maintain and promote our health. We must be more in touch with nature. Fresh air and beautiful sunlight are extremely beneficial to the human body. Therefore, we should have more outdoor activities and exercise our bodies properly. Life should be regular, and after work, we should rest more. Do not spend our exhausted bodies and minds on anything that is not conducive to health, so that our bodies and minds become even weaker. We should also make full use of natural nutritious foods, such as butter, beans, wheat, eggs, green vegetables, fruits, fish, meat, etc. These are all rich in nutrition and beneficial to our bodies and minds. We do not necessarily have to eat ginseng and bird's nest, because there are many nourishing foods in nature, so it is not very expensive. This is the same as the sun; it is not only the rich who can enjoy it.</p>
<p>The second method is to plan ahead to prevent diseases from prematurely causing our collapse. Although we may think we are in good health now, or only judge health by appearances, this is unreliable. I remember that in the past, at a medical school, all freshmen had to undergo very strict physical examinations when they entered the school, and each freshman had to have an X-ray to see the condition of their lungs. Once, in the examination of a class of freshmen, a student was found to have severe tuberculosis. But before the announcement, everyone was worried and thought that they were the unfortunate one, especially those who were short and thin. The result? It was a student who was the tallest, most robust, fattest, and most energetic-looking in the class. So you can't just look at appearances to determine a person's health. In fact, many athletes get lung disease. So the most appropriate way is to have a thorough physical examination on a regular basis, so that those diseases without obvious symptoms can be detected early and appropriate treatment can be given. The reason why human life is so short is because we usually do not pay attention to the fact that diseases are destroying us in secret. Periodic physical examinations can prevent this disadvantage. The cost is limited, and in terms of time, having a physical examination every few months takes less time than going to see a movie. Isn't this much more economical than waiting until the disease is serious and then going to see a doctor and taking medicine, spending a lot of money but without hope of recovery?</p>
<p>Therefore, in summary, at this time when the standard of living has reached its peak, we should not only plan for life's problems such as rice, wheat, firewood, and coal, but neglect our own more important and more relevant health issues. Because sacrificing health in exchange for rice, wheat, firewood, and coal, or having rice, wheat, firewood, and coal alone without health, is meaningless. We must plan for our future, for our careers, for our work, and for our economy, so the issue of health is not something that can be temporarily set aside: nor can it be solved by relying on others to promote a few sports and temporarily get excited. The most important thing is one's own awareness, to feel its crucial importance, and to cultivate it in daily habits. This is the most meaningful and economical approach. Because maintaining one's health costs very little, but the happiness, work, career, and happiness that can be exchanged for health are of immeasurable value.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Shanghai Hospital Equipment Completely Moved Away Yesterday. Four Trucks Were Fully Loaded, Leaving Almost Nothing Behind. Fortunately, Donations from All Parties Allow Work to Continue as Usual. <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>After all the important equipment of the Shanghai Hospital at 172 Qiqi Road in the French Concession was moved away last week, despite the opposition of Ms. Catherine Haeske, the American director of the hospital, it was ineffective. It is learned that starting at nine o'clock yesterday morning, all the furniture in the hospital was also moved away. Fortunately, after Ms. Haeske appealed to all parties, enthusiastic people from all walks of life were willing to donate various equipment and instruments to the hospital, so the hospital's operations have not been suspended.</p>
<p>Hospital Equipment All Moved Away</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, just as the hospital was starting to register patients for outpatient services, someone, along with a French inspector from the French Concession police and two Vietnamese police officers, arrived at the hospital in two trucks and with twelve porters. The director of the hospital, Ms. Haeske, negotiated with the visitors, but to no avail. So she let them act as they pleased, and they loaded the furniture in the hospital onto two trucks and left at around 11:00 AM. At around 2:00 PM in the afternoon, they came again for the second time. Seeing that there was nothing left to take, they loaded electric fans and other items onto two trucks and left at 4:30 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Losses Exceed 400,000</p>
<p>According to the hospital's estimate, the total loss is more than 400,000 yuan. Just the two X-ray machines alone are worth more than 100,000 yuan. The price of each of the other shadowless lamps is also more than 5,000 yuan. After these people's exhaustive search for several days, the instruments and equipment in the hospital have almost been moved away. The only things left are the beds that the patients sleep on.</p>
<p>Generous Assistance from All Sides</p>
<p>The director of the hospital, Ms. Haeske, stated that there are still more than 60 patients in the hospital and that treatment work cannot be interrupted for a single day. Therefore, she instructed the hospital's doctors and nurses to continue working as usual while appealing to all parties to borrow instruments and equipment. As a result of the appeal, the hospital received 100 beds yesterday morning, 50 of which were borrowed from the Shanghai Sanitarium and the other 50 from a school in Nanshi. In addition, an agency notified the hospital that it had 50 beds for sale at a very low price. In addition, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association on Linan Road lent an X-ray machine. According to a nurse in the hospital, Ms. Haeske's face showed a smile for the first time yesterday. Her appeal had been successful, so she was very happy.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Quick-Witted Taxi Driver Avoids Robbery of Large Sum of Money. Car Crashes into Wine Jars, Driver Takes the Opportunity to Jump Out. Detectives Chase After and Arrest Two Robbers. <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, two robbers attempted to rob a large sum of money on Route Paul Henry in the French Concession. Detectives intercepted them, and a gun battle ensued. As a result, the robbers ran out of bullets and were captured. The details of the case are recorded below:</p>
<p>Clerks Escorting Money</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM, the Nanyang Coal Ball Co., Ltd. First Factory sales office at 301 Route Paul Henry in the French Concession handed over more than 5,000 yuan in cash to Zhu Ziping and He Wenlian, two clerks from Yuyao, to be escorted to a bank on the Bund for deposit. At that time, He hired a Yunfei taxi with license plate number 12313, which was parked in front of the gate. At 9:25 AM, He and Zhu carried the money out of the factory and jumped into the car.</p>
<p>Two Robbers Watch and Plan Robbery</p>
<p>Earlier, at the Jiangzhe Hotel across the street at 464 Route Paul Henry, there were two customers, one wearing a striped short shirt and pants and the other wearing a black short shirt and pants. The former was in his twenties, and the latter was middle-aged. They sat at a table in front of the door, toasting each other, with their eyes fixed on the car. When they saw He and Zhu get into the car, the two customers immediately left their seats and ran to the front of the car. The younger one pulled out a pistol from his sleeve, opened the car door, and sat next to the driver, threatening him with the gun. The black-clad robber also scrambled into the back seat, forcing the driver to drive.</p>
<p>Car Enters Wine Store, Robbers Realize They've Been Tricked</p>
<p>The driver started the engine and drove east. At that time, the doorman of the factory knew that something had happened, but he had no weapons, so he blew the police whistle. The driver, knowing that he had encountered robbers, had a clever plan. He drove to the entrance of the Yuansheng Wine Store at 414 Rue Massenet, intending to crash the car into a utility pole and disable it. Unexpectedly, due to a slight carelessness, the front of the car drove into the wine store, breaking a large jar of sorghum wine and spilling wine all over the ground. The driver took this opportunity to jump out of the car and escape. At this time, a detective from the French Concession police had arrived after hearing the alarm and tried to arrest them. The robbers preemptively opened fire on the detective and ran east. The detective also returned fire.</p>
<p>Gunfire Erupts, Two Robbers Captured</p>
<p>Then, a guard post at 137 Route des Soeurs heard the gunfire and drew his gun to intercept them. The robbers turned into Route de Belles and fled north, firing frequently. The guard also fired his gun. As a result, the robber ran to the entrance of Meilanfang and, having run out of bullets, raised his hands. The detective stepped forward and captured him and seized his pistol. The other robber had also been arrested and burst into tears. At this time, the French Concession police had dispatched a large team of Chinese and Western detectives. Seeing that the robbers had all been captured, they escorted them to the police station for questioning. It was reported that the robber who opened fire was injured and captured, but this was not true. During the exchange of more than ten shots, stray bullets flew everywhere. One bullet hit the foot of a chauffeur at a certain number in Meilanfang, but he was not seriously injured.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 9th) at 1:30 PM, a French Concession Route 22 public bus number 835, traveling from Xujiahui to the Bund, was driving to the intersection of Avenue Foch and Route Tenant de la Tour when a truck carrying goods, license number 23093, fully loaded with coal, rushed out of Route Tenant de la Tour. Because it was traveling at full speed, it was unable to brake in time, resulting in a violent collision between the two vehicles. Both vehicles were severely damaged. The rear of the public bus was completely destroyed. The passengers in the car were extremely alarmed and got out of the car one after another. Two passengers were slightly injured in the head and face after being shaken and falling in the car and went to the hospital for treatment on their own. For a time, traffic was blocked there for more than thirty minutes before it was restored. It is found that the road there is narrow and winding, making it prone to collisions. Collisions have occurred repeatedly. Drivers should pay more attention in the future.</p>

<p>The exchange rate premium has been rising since it occurred last Saturday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. It was even worse yesterday because there was a shortage of exchange rate chips on the market, and the Tianjin gang needed to exchange money, so various banks and small money shops had different high and low prices for the exchange rate premium, including par, and premiums of 2.3 yuan and 5 yuan per thousand yuan. The highest price was 9.75 yuan, meaning that for every 1,000 yuan exchanged, one could redeem 1,009.95 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listed prices for all currencies were flat, and the dark market for British and American currencies trended towards tightening. This was because gold prices rose sharply, and it was heard that there were He sugar settlements, which aroused speculation in the city and in Hong Kong. After opening in the morning, the market was quite stable. More than half an hour later, it was heard that the remaining prices were rising. At the height of speculative activity, a Hong Kong firm shorted 100,000 US dollars for next month, and the market immediately softened to 5.34375 yuan. At the same time, import foreign firms settled advances, causing sterling to tighten to 3 pence 296875. In the afternoon, speculators continued to short, and it was difficult to settle recent US dollars at 5.34375 yuan for a time, but it soon returned to flat. In the end, sterling tightened by 015625, and the US dollar tightened by 01225. Trading was quite active.</p>
<p>*   Sterling Had He Sugar Settlements</p>
<p>Since the morning, foreign telegrams reported that American and European banks had no market, and Indian banks shrank slightly. Exchange rates of various countries compared to Shanghai were up 03125, and the rest were flat. The central bank's listed prices for all currencies were flat.

Gold prices rose sharply, and it was heard that a Hong Kong telegram reported shorting July US dollars at 5.375 and 34375 yuan. Chinese merchants also settled advances at the same price, and the trend softened. Although American banks supplied without fail, there were also He sugar settlements in sterling, and the price tightened from 3 pence 13125 to 3 pence 296875. Near noon, speculators who were short on July US dollars at 5.375 yuan had few counterparts, and the tightening trend began to stabilize. At noon, sterling closed at 3 pence 296875 and the US dollar at 5.34375 yuan.</p>
<p>*   Afternoon Market Slightly More Stable</p>

A certain foreign bank's broker shorted July US dollars at 5.375 yuan, and speculators shorted the same month at 5.34375 yuan. The recent term once softened to the point where it was difficult to settle at the above price, but it soon stabilized.

<p>Yesterday, the gold market was hot, and the dark market rose steadily. Prices had already reached the 6,500 yuan mark. (After the close, it had already broken through.) Most people in the market were firmly bullish. This was because there was a lack of short news during the holiday week, and the foreign exchange market tightened in the morning. The current installment drop period will begin at 8:00 PM this weekend, which is usually beneficial to buyers, so short sellers started to cover. Under the buying pressure from securities firms, gold firms, and banks, the price rose more easily, rising from 6,455 yuan to reach the 6,500 yuan mark in the afternoon. Xin Fengyong's large-scale hedging slightly stabilized the market. In the end, it continued to rise by 47 yuan. After the close, it rose again to 6,5035 yuan.

It was soon seen that Yi Da, Da Lan, Hongqing, Yong, and others were aggressively buying, and scattered shorts were covering, so the price gradually rose. When it was heard that foreign exchange was also tightening, Tianyuan bought in at 10:15 AM, raising the price to 6,490 yuan. Xinyuan Securities Firm saw the high and sold, causing a pullback to 6,472 yuan. Chengji bought in aggressively, and later fluctuated narrowly around 80 yuan, once rising to 6,482 yuan. Shortly after, the market closed at 6,478 yuan at noon. The afternoon market opened at 6,480 yuan, 2 yuan higher than the noon close. Dafeng, Defu, and bank firms bought aggressively, and scattered retail investors continued to absorb, so the price gradually rose. When rumors of good news spread, fueling the buying trend, the market immediately surged to the 6,500 yuan mark. Xin Fengyong sold a large amount of remittances for hedging, and Chengji also sold, retreating to 6,493 yuan. The market closed at 3:30 PM at 6,496 yuan, 47 yuan higher than last Saturday's noon close. Valued at 6,517 yuan based on the June US dollar settlement price of 5.34375 yuan, which is 21 yuan higher.

<h3 id="e75">Grain: Tribute Rice Arrives in Port Today and Yesterday; Rice Prices Are Cunning but Ultimately Cannot Raise Their Heads <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Tribute rice has arrived in Shanghai again. The French company's Jin Diya vessel docked yesterday, carrying more than 1,300 tons of foreign rice directly from Saigon, totaling 14,500 bags, which were unloaded at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou. It is heard that the Dada Niang postal ship may arrive today with a large batch of tribute rice. (Zu)</p>
<p>The foreign rice market is still hovering, rising first and then falling, with a fluctuation of 123 yuan throughout the day. This was because local customers were purchasing when the market opened, and there was a relatively strong demand from Ningbo and other places in the interior. It was also rumored that a small shipment of a certain foreign firm had been blocked, so the market price was immediately raised. It was heard that the new transaction parent had Dingtai Shenji and others order 3,000 tons of June No. 2 Siamese rice for only 127 yuan, but it was still difficult for those in Ningbo and other places in the interior to fulfill the outstanding orders, so many scattered customers took advantage of the high price to sell, and the market immediately turned downwards. The British Hua Company continued to negotiate new transactions and put out the floating customer orders, and the market was weak. No. 1 current Saigon was from 138 yuan 5 jiao to 135 yuan 8 jiao, small shipment current 136 yuan 5 jiao, June bottom 136 yuan, mid-June 137 yuan, broken rice 106 yuan, road 105 yuan. Total transactions were more than 1,000 tons of original bags and 1,800 bags of current rice, which was a drop of 23 yuan compared to the previous week. No. 1 Saigon was from 117 yuan to 116 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>No. 1 white 112 yuan, No. 1 rice 1145 yuan, High No. 1 111 yuan, 110 yuan, Min Dangte was from 119 yuan to 116 yuan, small shipment 1134 yuan, Tokyo pointed rice 108 yuan to 106 yuan, rice tea 102 yuan 100 yuan, broken pointed 91 yuan 90 yuan.</p>
<p>There were few thick and thin Japonica national rice arrivals. Local shops mostly bought in small quantities and did not prepare large inventories. In addition to slightly adding to the immediate needs, Najiang was weak. Newly opened South Port early and late rice fresh specials were still 136 yuan 5 jiao, 135 yuan, ordinary 134 yuan to 130 yuan, Wuxi old Japonica original bag was from 124 yuan to 120 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice continued to be in short supply, and the situation was bullish. The selling price continued to rise by 12 yuan. Opened Hong Kong white yuan high from 117 yuan to 113 yuan, glutinous rice was 1056 yuan, national glutinous rice went in an ordinary direction, and the market had no honor or disgrace, and the performance opened at 1212 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Flour Market Initially Firm, Then Flat <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The current foreign flour market situation: initially firm, then flat. When the market opened in the morning, local customers' actual sales were still good. The price of Jinlong brand Kan flour rose from 28 yuan 6 jiao to 28 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen. Caishun brand US flour opened at 28 yuan 8 jiao. Because the quality of US flour was higher and there were fewer chips, the selling price was quite firm. However, the situation in the later market was loose, because rice prices were reported to have fallen, the cake market had fallen back, and people's minds gradually relaxed. Jinlong flour returned to the original level of 28 yuan 6 jiao. Hua Niao flour shouted a price of 30 yuan, and Paotai flour 29 yuan 5 jiao, but no one asked about them. The market has entered a period of hovering.</p>
<p>Wheat trading is still stagnant. Although the old wheat in Shanghai has not completely disappeared, there is no wheat for sale. The current output of new wheat in the interior is low and the cost is high, so there is no arrival for the time being. At this time, supply and demand are both silent. It is estimated that new wheat can be officially put on the market in about a week.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Cake Bulls Cannot Overcome Short Selling Pressure <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market situation: Initially, it carried on the momentum from the end of last week. The bulls' efforts to raise prices were still tight. At the highest point, it rose by about 1 jiao, but because the overall trend was far from the peak of actual sales, it was difficult to resist short selling pressure. Most floating longs rushed to sell, and the market price fell. In the middle, due to the multi-head door method, the market situation rose and fell sharply, fluctuating up and down. At the most tired time, it fell by 67 jiao compared to Saturday. When the market closed, it was slightly raised by about a jiao due to short covering. A total of more than 50,000 pieces of various cakes were traded. Because the negotiable chips for soybean oil were held by the conditioning company and not released, the market had been brewing for a long time. Recently, the market atmosphere was good, and buyers were slightly loosening their prices, so the company continued to release. The market rose again yesterday. It is estimated that more than 1,000 barrels of Dalian oil sold for 171 yuan. Fifty barrels for delivery at the end of June were ordered for 173 yuan 5 jiao. Peanut oil also rose by about 1 yuan.</p>

<p>The public debt market rebounded yesterday. The domestic debts fell more sharply, by about 1 yuan, while the rest fell by only 56 jiao. The eleventh draw for the E-bond will be held today, so yesterday afternoon's market price was calculated according to the right to exclude the winning prize. However, the market initially reduced the winning prize by 6 jiao, and then by only 1 jiao 5 fen, which shows that there are many buyers. Because there were no changes in the environment, the market quickly rebounded by half a yuan. In the morning, the northern banks, such as Tongji and Gongmao, had a strong appetite. Although Tongkang still had some sales, it uniquely absorbed the E-bond. Runde Yitai had a few sales. The market closed at about half a yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the E-bond was calculated excluding the winning prize, and Hefeng absorbed it in large quantities, so the initial exclusion of the right to 6 jiao was quickly returned to a high of half a yuan. Hefeng also searched for the B-bond, and it was raised to 71 yuan. Therefore, the C-bond, which had initially fallen to 8 yuan 5 jiao, suddenly rose to 9 yuan. Hongda still made consistent actual purchases, and Lianhe, Kang Defu, and Hengfu all had purchases. The seller was only Changkang, and the rest, such as Jiucheng Yizhong Sheng and Shao, were few. Scattered retail sales were relatively busy, but the market had rebounded by 34 jiao compared to the morning. As a result of one day, except for the B-bond, which rose by 1 jiao, the rest all pulled back by 2 jiao to 7 jiao. Turnover was approximately 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>*   Stock Trading: 30 shares of Xianghua Electric Company stock were traded at a price of 28 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>The general stock market was quiet and stable. Among the rubber stocks, the British Zha and Langerzhi stocks continued to decline. The rubber trust stock, on the other hand, rose, already reaching 10 yuan 4 jiao. The prices of industrial stocks were roughly the same as the previous close.</p>

<p>The yarn market is rising from a period of hovering, which is due to the good standard gold, and at the same time, the Hong Kong gangs have a need for three types of cotton yarn: 32-count, 23-count, and 20-count, and have ordered 740 packages. However, the ten-count coarse yarn is already full, and it seems to have stopped for the time being without buying. Therefore, people's hearts are more invigorated, and the buying trend has become stronger. The high price for 20-count double yarn is 1,444 yuan, and the low price is 1,430 yuan. The market situation was quite good in the afternoon. As the domestic gold price progressed, the cotton yarn followed the rise. The spot price was sufficient compared to the morning, initially trading at 1,442 yuan, and then gradually rising to 1,454 yuan. The final price was 1,4578 yuan with someone selling.</p>
<p>When Shuangma opened in the morning, the atmosphere was good. The first round price was 1,430 yuan. As soon as this round opened, buyers came one after another. Under this competition, it slowly rose to 1,444 yuan. Those who were profitable in the middle sold, and it returned to 1,439 yuan. Everyone said that the table was quite good, with more buyers and fewer sellers, and the market situation was still strong and rising. The closing price was 1,440 yuan. According to statistics, 6,740 packages were traded in half a day, including 740 packages sold by the Hong Kong gang and 6,000 packages by counterparts.</p>

<p>The factory cloth market was slightly firm yesterday, because the original yarn stopped falling and rebounded, people's hearts turned upward, and the intention was strong. The Hong Kong gang and the South Seas gang also saw an increase in spot purchases, so the selling plates of each cloth uniformly reported rises. As a result, white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill rose by 2 jiao 5 fen to 5 jiao per piece, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 5 jiao. Approximately 500 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. The Guangdong, Hong Kong, and South Seas gangs bought clean dyed cloth and coarse cloth from Yihuo, Lunchang, and other factories for several hundred pieces. The northern road Yantai Qingdao gangs bought coarse cloth and other goods for more than one hundred pieces.</p>
<p>As for Dongbu, the four gentleman's serge saw the strongest rise. In the morning, it rose from 1 yuan 4 jiao 4 fen 7 li 5 hao to 1 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen 5 hao. In the afternoon, with the sharp rise in yarn prices, people's hearts became more determined, reaching 1 yuan 4 jiao 6 fen 2 li 5 hao. The closing price of Longtou fine cloth in the evening was 45 yuan 1 jiao 7 fen Niu per piece, which was also a rise of 45 jiao per piece compared to last week. However, mid- and low-end miscellaneous brand fine cloths still showed no sign of improvement.</p>

<p>Since the conflict between the long and short sides in sugar futures, although there have been many days of negotiations, opinions have not yet converged, so the October futures, which were due for delivery yesterday, have not been implemented and are still in a stalemate. The Public Association's marked spot price of 24 coarse white sugar had weak actual sales. April arrivals at the foreign warehouse were 93 yuan, May arrivals were 93 yuan 5 jiao, each down 5 jiao. Dutch red was 70 yuan zero 9 jiao, down 1 jiao. Taikoo's Che Bai DY mark was 95 yuan, with no changes. The rest lacked transactions.</p>

<p>Fresh bamboo shoot clothes have recently become tight due to scarce arrivals. Since it is now the season for sesame food, this item is very suitable for the tastes of those in need, so although the selling price is high, once there is a shortage, it will continue to rise. It is estimated that the previous market was 360 yuan, and yesterday's market was 400 yuan for the higher price and 380 yuan for the next highest.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Cotton (2) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>For example, in Wan Zhen of the Tang Dynasty's "Strange Things of the Southern States," it is very clearly stated: "Kapok comes from Ceiba…" Doesn't this clearly state that Ceiba is a plant, a tree, and kapok is a type of cotton that is different from silk floss? However, 'Ceiba' is a foreign word, and ordinary people who hear it are at a loss. Thus, naturally, "Ceiba tree" became the easier-to-understand "Kapok tree;" further, the word "绵" (mian, floss) in "Kapok tree" was adjusted to fit the situation and changed to "棉" (mian, cotton), becoming "Kapok tree;" even later, the word "tree" could be omitted, becoming "Kapok," and the word "wood" could also be deleted, directly calling it "Cotton!" Thus, the process of evolution was completed, and "Cotton" became the actual name of this plant! This is not a fabrication out of thin air. We only need to see that the character "棉" (cotton) is not found in ancient dictionaries such as "Erya," "Shuowen," and "Shiming," but is first found in "Yupian" written by Gu Yewang of the Chen and Liang dynasties to understand: this was precisely the time when this plant was being imported into China in full swing! Furthermore, it is further confirmed by the situation of other foreign specialties entering China: initially, merchants translated their sounds, later combined with their duration, and then created a character to name them. For example, tobacco became "tambako," then "yan cao" (tobacco), then "yan" (smoke)—when has the original Chinese character "yan" (smoke) ever had this meaning?—and now a general chemical term! This makes it even clearer that this kind of evolution and change has its own step-by-step, methodical stages and steps that cannot be disrupted in the slightest.</p>
<p>There are both woody and herbaceous types of cotton. The origin of the woody type is India, and it can grow to seventeen or eighteen feet tall; the ancestral home of the herbaceous type is Egypt or Arabia, and it is only three feet tall. Some botanists believe that they are originally the same species: growing into a tree shape in tropical areas, but when migrated to temperate zones, it becomes herbaceous in order to adapt to the environment. Regardless, our ancient people were limited by the commonly seen herbaceous cotton, and also because of the counterfeit "Bombax ceiba" - which also falsely claims to be "Kapok," and can grow to eighty or ninety feet tall, and has no relationship to woody cotton - to confuse the situation, they hesitated to believe what their predecessors said about Ceiba being a "tree." As the "Wutong Zapei" says: "Kapok, the flower color is deep red, similar to camellia,... the fruit is as large as a wine cup, the floss comes out of the mouth, fluffy like fine fluff. It is said that the barbarians of Hainan used to weave it into cloth... now it is only used to fill quilts,... and no one has used it to make cloth." Xu Wending Gong also said: "Ceiba... is originally herbaceous,... Bombax ceiba is used to make quilts, although soft and smooth, it is not tough, and cannot be pulled, so how can it be made into cloth?... "This is completely mistaking the kapok (Bombax ceiba) that we now use to fill pillows as the cotton produced by the Ceiba that the predecessors recorded as being able to be drawn and woven into cloth. Even Li Yanshou, who first highlighted the name of Ceiba in official history, said very clearly in the "Biography of Lin Yiguo": "Lin Yiguo produces Ceiba. Ceiba is the name of a 'tree'. When the flowers bloom, they are like goose down, and the floss is drawn out and spun to make cloth, which is no different from ramie cloth." However, in the "Biography of Gaochangguo," he did not dare to mention the name of Ceiba, but said: "There is grass with fruits like cocoons, containing cotton inside, and seeds inside the cotton,... used to make fine silk, called white cocoons." Perhaps he also had some doubts and dared not definitively recognize that they had a blood relationship. Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty said in "Bencao Gangmu": only the famous monk Zan Yun of the Song Dynasty, in translating the "Mingyi Ji," asserted their kinship in one breath, saying: "Ceiba, that is, kapok. In India, the large ones become trees, while this one is small, shaped like a 'tui' vegetable, with a shell, which is cut open to take out the flowers, like willow catkins, which can be sewn into cloth."</p>
<p>Since the ancestral home of cotton is in India, and India is so close to our country, this precious plant that provides clothing for the masses, after having a brief encounter with us through the occasional tribute of "island barbarians" in the mid-23rd century BC, broke off contact with us again, and did not generously bestow itself upon China again until the mid-3rd or 4th centuries AD: it truly cannot help but make us feel "Why are you coming so late!" Now, let us briefly describe the process of our gradual acquaintance with it.</p>
<p>What is mentioned in the "Yugong" chapter has already been quoted above. Thereafter, until the Three Kingdoms period, a commentator on the "Book of Han" named Meng Kang told us: "The people of Min call cotton Ceiba from the island." The "Book of Liang, Emperor Wu's Chronicle" describes the emperor's frugality: "The emperor himself wears cloth clothes and 'kapok' black tents; one hat lasts three years, and one quilt lasts two years." It can be seen that at this time, the scope of its use had only expanded to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. From the "Biography of Gaochangguo" in Li Yanshou's "History of the Southern Dynasties," it can be known that at the same time, cotton was already being cultivated in our Xinjiang Province. Wan Zhen of the Tang Dynasty said in his "Strange Things of the Southern States": "Kapok comes from Ceiba. When ripe, it is like goose down,... the kernels are like beads, and when used, the kernels are removed; in the past, 'rollers' were used, but now 'churns' are used, which is even more convenient." It can be seen that he had already noticed the progress of cotton-making tools. As for Shi Zhao, who had been a teacher to Su Dongpo's brothers and was also from Meishan, explained Ceiba in the "Zizhi Tongjian" by saying: "Planted in February or March, it produces yellow flowers in autumn, and bears fruit. When ripe, the skin splits and blossoms out like cotton. The kernels are removed with iron, and bamboo is used as a bow, with a string to fluff it finely, rolled into a tube, and spun on a wheel, which naturally draws out the fibers." How detailed and thorough his description of the old cotton-making process is!</p>
<p>However, what we should especially be grateful for and should record here is the great contributor to the spread of cotton, "Huang Daopo" from Shanghai. The "Shanghai County Chronicle" records what Zhang Zhixiang of the Ming Dynasty said: "Huang Daopo was originally from this town—Wunijing—and initially fell into Yazhou; during the Yuanzhen period (1295), she returned on a sea-going ship, bringing with her the seeds of kapok from Fujian and Guangdong, and spun and wove it into cloth, which the villagers followed her in doing, and the industry became quite prosperous…" What Tao Zongyi of the Yuan Dynasty recorded in "Chu Geng Lu" is especially clear: "Many kapok trees are planted in Fujian and Guangdong, and spun and woven into cloth, which is called Ceiba. About fifty miles east of Songjiang Prefecture is Wunijing: the land there is barren, and the people have little food. Therefore, they sought to grow crops to make a living, and sought seeds from there (to be continued)"</p>

<p>The Sino-Western Cup Table Tennis Tournament, the B group program has been completed, and the Youth Team and the Shanghai Children Team have equal records. However, the Youth Team has more winning points and ranks first. The organizer specially set up a special silver cup for the Shanghai Children Team, whose five young players performed excellently, which will be competed for by the Youth Team against the Shanghai Children Team. The match was held at 7:30 pm the night before at the auditorium of the Fifth China Vocational Continuation School on Nanjing Road. After Chairman Chen Linsheng delivered a speech, the competition began. The young players of the Shanghai Children Team were agile and had extraordinary skills. Because Lie Baotai made a mistake and used reserve player Huang Ruhao, Huang performed poorly and lost five games in a row, putting the Shanghai Children Team in a dead end. The Youth Team defeated the Shanghai Children Team by a score of 13 to 11 and won the double championship in the group. The Shanghai Children Team flourished and then declined, failing to achieve success. However, young players Yang Changjia, Huang Yongkang, and Cheng Hongwei played very well. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Youth Team Win/Loss</p>
<p>Shanghai Children Team Win/Loss</p>
<p>Li Min 3/2 Yang Changjia 2/3</p>
<p>Zheng Rong 1/4 Huang Ruhao 0/5</p>

<p>(Hong Kong News) In the Gangende Cup Volleyball Finals, Peiying played against Nanhua on the other day. Peiying has many good players such as the Li Lianze and Lian Ying brothers, as well as Qiu Guangxie and Chen Yingkuan, and has a strong strength. Although Nanhua has killer Yu Qien, but because of the lack of coordination, it cannot exert its power. As a result, Peiying overwhelmed Nanhua and won the championship by a score of three to one.

<h3 id="e101">Academic Lecture: How to Study English (1) <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Studying English, some people think it is very difficult, while others think it is easy. Some people think that three or five years is enough, while others say that it is impossible to succeed without more than ten years. There are also people who say that English can be self-taught.</p>
<p>In the author's humble opinion, I think these statements are all correct. Why? Because people's talents are different, and each person's goals are different, so each person's views cannot be the same. The same thing, A thinks it is very difficult, B may think it is easy. Some people set their goals closer and smaller, naturally it only takes three or five years to achieve them. Conversely, if the goal is set far and large, the time limit will of course be longer. Take the author personally, from elementary school to university, there are at least ten years without interruption in English lessons. My career has been closely related to English to some extent. Until last year, I made up my mind to set a five-year plan to study English and English literature.</p>
<p>Speaking of self-taught, those who take a few sentences of "pidgin English" as the goal do not need to be said. Only those who study on their own can indeed do it. The author knows a few people whose translations have now become successful. Not only are the results numerous, but they are also quite good. However, their English had some foundation beforehand.</p>

<p>— Kaiming</p>
<p>It is said that the German side is investing huge amounts of money to conquer the Syrian natives. The British are also using the same method to win over the Arab chiefs. The two sides can be said to be evenly matched.</p>
<p>In order to conquer Syria, the German side has specifically established a new slogan to win the hearts of the Arabs: "Muhammad rules the heavens, Hitler rules the earth!"</p>
<p>Today, the best way to please British local officials is to say: "Your place was bombed more fiercely than other places." Because this shows that they "can afford it." In England, the cities that are bombed the most donate the most to the "war preparedness fund."</p>
<p>The pain of national subjugation is the same in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. The best example is today's Europe.</p>
<p>A thirty-five-year-old Dutch female lawyer was sentenced to five months in prison for writing a poem "insulting the German army."</p>
<p>This female lawyer and a seventeen-year-old boy were convicted of spreading the news that the German air force was bombing the Netherlands and attributing it to the British air force. A middle school teacher was also sentenced to six months in prison for this.</p>
<p>An eighteen-year-old boy was convicted of reading a poem insulting the German commissioner in the Netherlands, Seyss-Inquart, and was sentenced to four months in prison.</p>

<p>— Pan Peiying</p>
<p>Life spans several decades, and about one-third of that time is spent in sleep; because human affairs are complicated and there are few people who are absolutely healthy, there are many people who dream in their sleep, and it is even more common to talk about their dreams during the day. Since "dreams" are closely related to life at all times, it does not seem unworthy to talk about. However, ordinary people talk about dreams, either bizarre and magical, or with far-fetched explanations, making "dreams" mysterious and mysterious. In the end, both the listener and the speaker become confused.</p>
<p>Most dreams take place in a state of half clarity and half blur, and very clear dreams are rare; never mind the blur, if you look at dreams with another kind of vision, you can discover the following characteristics of dreams:</p>
<p>Contradictory—Anything that is actually impossible will become possible in dreams. People who know nothing about mechanics can fly airplanes in their dreams; people who have no musical skills can play the trumpet in their dreams. Isn't this extremely contradictory?</p>
<p>Chaotic—Rare are dreams that are organized, most dreams are very chaotic. Originally walking with a friend, suddenly you are sitting on a train, and after a while, your relatives are chatting with you at home. How to get on the train and how to get back home are sudden changes, and there is no reason to explain.</p>
<p>Complex—During the day, when doing things, such as eating and writing letters, you always do one thing at a time. In dreams, people seem to be omnipotent, and a person can do many things at the same time. When none of these things are finished, they change to another place to do many other things. Upside down, complexity is extreme.</p>
<p>Intricate—The neighbor's chicken flew into my hat, my brother is using my money to treat people to ice soda, and so on, things that are intertwined and pulled around are most common in dreams.</p>
<p>In addition, a person's personality and ability will not be lost in dreams, the most obvious is</p>
<p>Understanding in Dreams—Personal understanding exists in dreams, and can continue to be active. For example, you must pay for buying books; be careful not to fall into the water when rowing a boat. These two thoughts will exist in dreams.</p>
<p>Creativity in Dreams—The ability to create also exists in dreams. Painters can paint in dreams, and writers can compose poems in dreams. Good poems and paintings can often still be remembered after waking up, and can really be left on paper.</p>
<p>Memory in Dreams—Old friends and relatives can often be met in dreams, and dreamers often have the impression that "isn't he already dead?" At that time, people may wake up immediately, or they will still involuntarily continue to dream.</p>
<p>Fear and Habit in Dreams—A person's character will not change in dreams. People who are so timid that they are even afraid of mice will still run away when they see mice in their dreams. At the same time, people who love to drink will often dream of drinking with others; people who like to fight will inevitably fight with others even in their dreams.</p>
<p>What kind of people will have what kind of dreams at what time. Dreams are related to each person's age and situation. If they can be studied, it is not a loss to be a very meaningful thing.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Old But Not Decaying <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>In the past decade, the population of the United States has increased by 7.2%; the number of Americans over the age of 65 has increased by 2,323,401, accounting for approximately 35%. What are these elderly people doing after they receive their pensions? This is truly worthy of our attention. According to a survey by the United Press, most of them are still as "handsome" as young people. In Chester, South Carolina, there is a woman who is already 81 years old but still goes to university to study astronomy; in Santa Ana, there is an 81-year-old man who recently completed a solo flight; in Philadelphia, there is a 91-year-old athlete who spends his days rowing on the Schuylkill River; in Westminster, California, a man celebrates his 115th birthday by chopping trees, a strenuous activity.</p>
<p>This shows that a hardworking person will never say things like "I'm old, I'm useless!" Young people should of course be even more motivated and work harder!</p>

<h3 id="e105">Witnessing Evolution <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Shen</p>
<p>Biological evolution is a very slow and long process. For example, the evolution from reptiles to birds, from five-toed horses to one-toed horses, and from primitive humans to modern humans all took hundreds of millions of years. Therefore, biologists can now only find some fairly reliable evidence to infer the existence of this phenomenon, but they cannot witness the process.</p>
<p>However, at the California agricultural experiment station in the United States, we can actually see a scene of evolution. This was accidentally discovered during pesticide testing. When gardeners sprayed highly toxic powders on flowers or vegetables, the parasites infesting them should have been completely eradicated. However, unexpectedly, over time, the effectiveness of this poison gradually decreased. Originally, the poison could not completely eradicate the insect eggs. The newborn insects and their offspring, after struggling hard in a harsh environment, actually gained the resilience to resist the poison, eventually evolving into a stronger new species.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, Professor Milan of New York University had the foresight to predict that plant pests would gradually develop resistance to commonly used poisons. This theory was dismissed as nonsense by scholars at the time because it lacked factual basis. Unexpectedly, it has now come to pass. Moreover, the matter is not that simple. Agricultural chemists in California have discovered that after pests develop resistance to one type of poison, they simultaneously develop the same resistance to other types of poisons. After apple tree larvae acquire the ability to resist arsenic compounds, the use of pyrethrum will not harm them at all. What's worse is that pests originally could only live on certain plants, but after mutation, their range of activity has expanded to other plants; therefore, apple tree moth larvae have transformed into walnut tree pests. This is truly "the Tao is one foot high, the devil is ten feet high." If the pressure exerted on them by humans can be said to be a kind of natural selection, then the strength of their weak lives struggling to survive is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>But humans are certainly not willing to be outdone. Scientists are continuing to research more effective pesticides, and will not stop until final victory. This is a long-term war. Crop pests cause us to suffer immeasurable losses in value every year. They are our real enemies.</p>

<p>(9) A Strange Farmer</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang didn't have time to answer. He busily scooped up a bowl of half-yellow, half-black cool tea from the teacup and drank it in one gulp. The few bulging blue veins in his neck receded a little.</p>
<p>"Gouzi had something to do and went back today! Wang Si can't carry back the few baskets of beans harvested this morning alone!" He loosened the collar of his blue cloth jacket slightly. Although he had been a farmer for two or three years, he was still not used to baring his chest. "It's good for me to exercise my muscles and bones," he said with a smile.</p>
<p>Wu Da and Wang Si, carrying a basket of beans, had already turned towards the house on the east side.</p>
<p>"I told you long ago that two workers are not enough. You insisted on sending that Zhang Lai Li away in the spring. In fact, the family isn't short of one person's food and drink!" Wu Da's voice rang out from the other side of the door, with a hint of complaint.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang put down his teacup and smiled bitterly to himself.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why he sent Zhang Lai Li away was not to save one person's food and drink. In reality, he had his own difficulties. Because this Li Family Village was a very small village, and several out of ten families were poor people living in hardship. When Qiu Haitang brought his daughter back, although it wasn't with fine horses, light furs, and servants like clouds, in the eyes of those poor people, he already looked like a local tyrant. Therefore, later on, many relatives came to him to borrow money. It just so happened that Qiu Haitang was always accustomed to being generous. Listening to their pitiful stories, he didn't ask who was Zhang San or Li Si, and agreed to everyone who came. Uncle Wu initially didn't stop him because he had just returned to the countryside and had to socialize with relatives and neighbors. But later, he saw that even people who had no connections were coming to find his nephew. (128)</p>

<p>A certain hospital in New York, in order to make patients forget the monotonous life in the hospital, has specially built the deck of a giant ship on the roof of the hospital, so that patients can take walks "on the ship," take sunbaths, exercise, or play other games, as if they were on a voyage on the vast ocean. All the facilities "on the ship" are exactly the same as on a giant ship, even the uniforms of the "ship's" attendants and the chimes that announce the time are the same as on a giant ship.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Yu Ling's New Work Premieres <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Chu</p>
<p>Recently, Yu Ling's new work, "Gratitude and Grievance," has premiered at the Swatow Theatre. In the past, the plays written by Yu Ling, such as "Tears on Flowers," "Women's Apartment," and "Daughter Country," all leaned towards the type of "The Scholars," writing about the complex aspects of society, with several events mixed together, not a simple and unique story. "Similar to "The Great Ming Heroes," but changed the style, leaning towards structural simplicity and compactness. The current "Gratitude and Grievance" is also like this, truly "tragic, desolate, passionate, sharp, tense, and stimulating," indeed a good play. In order to avoid a sad or imperfect ending, Wu Chen has the Zhou warlord and the red dancer who wanted to eliminate him die together, not letting the Zhou warlord live alone. This kind of change can be said to be from pessimistic to optimistic, from negative to positive, just like the way the Shanghai Bank employees changed the plot when they performed Wu Tian's one-man show. We may say that a failed plan can arouse our deep thoughts and sighs, leaving a lingering taste; after a successful reunion, the audience will leave with satisfaction and no longer think about this matter. However, can every audience be like this? For people who are done with it after watching, it is best to give them excitement rather than disappointment and decadence.</p>
<p>This play is not only well-written, but also well-acted. Lin Na's Murong Wan'er is very witty, Zhou Fuxiang's Chou Quan is extremely sinister and ruthless, Wang Wei's Xiao Xiang is pitiful, Leng Shan's Wu Bin is like a fool, Wukong's orderly is grinning, and Leng Jing's Wu mother is muddled and humble, all able to portray their personalities. Due to the many applauses from the audience in the fourth act, that is, the last act, it can be seen that the audience was very moved, and it can also be seen that the meaning of this play is very profound. Even from a popular or interesting point of view, the intrigue and hypocrisy of the female spies are also very dramatic.</p>
<p>In order to strive for perfection, it seems that there are three small places that can be discussed: Firstly, when Wu Bin says that his lover "is only one person, and that is you," there should be a slight pause at the word "person," and it should not be continuous; it would be better to change it to "there is only one, and that is you." Secondly, in the second act, Xiao Xiang, with her back to the window, speaks to the young lady without turning her head, and then says, "Oh, miss, look at that fire," as if she has eyes in the back of her head; she should first turn around to look out the window, and then turn back to say to the young lady, "Oh." Also, the backdrop of the fourth act was not pulled tight enough, and it was too wrinkled; the table lamp was also not placed securely, and it fell on the ground twice. But these small places can be easily fixed. In general, this play is the best play of the Tianfeng Drama Society (better than the previous ones); the most rare thing is that it is extremely valuable and meaningful.</p>

<p>Tan Ying, this "mysterious girl" on the silver screen, has been active in the film circle for a long and illustrious history of ten years. Her appearance on the silver screen in her first film, "Hate for a Misstep," made her famous in one fell swoop, and she has always had a very wide audience.</p>
<p>Not long ago, she went to Hong Kong to meet Cheng Bugao once, but soon returned to Shanghai. Now, she is going to Hong Kong again, and she has already decided to set sail by ship today. This trip will not only bid a long farewell to Shanghai, but also announce her departure from the film industry.</p>
<p>The reporter met with Tan Ying at her residence the day before yesterday - Maoling Village, Yaojiao Road. According to her, the reason for her departure from the film industry this time is that her physical strength is declining and she is suffering from eye disease. She did not intend to return to Shanghai after her last trip to Hong Kong, but her eye disease broke out, so she specially returned to Shanghai for treatment. Although she has now recovered, the doctor instructed her that she can no longer work under strong mercury lamps, otherwise her eye disease will never be able to recover. On the other hand, she said that she is also too disappointed with the Shanghai film industry. The subject matter, consciousness, and everything are coerced by the environment, making people unable to breathe. Furthermore, she has been working in the film industry for ten years and should retire. For these reasons, she decided to get rid of this screen career and take the opportunity to go to Hong Kong and Singapore to recuperate. Fortunately, after Cheng Bugao changed careers to do business, his situation is much better than before.</p>

<p>Colman seems to have been away from the fans for a long time. But he is a rare talent on the silver screen. He was once famous, and he is not outdated now. Looking at his recent "The Prisoner of Zenda" and "Random Harvest", not only does he not see his decline, but his acting skills are even more refined. He stepped onto the stage in 1916. In the play "The Maharanee of Arakan," he played a black-faced guy. He was born in Richmond, England, and studied at Hyde School. He came to the United States after the First World War. At this time, he starred in his first film called "The White Sister". He has been married twice. His current wife is Chic Benite Hume.</p>

<p>Xu Jing said, "I did this a bit rashly, but I am still well-intentioned towards Yu Yongtai, and perhaps he can understand. Most likely, he will not lightly forgive that pair of dog men and women. Also, the whereabouts of the assassins from Zhou Jiangzhong's side are unknown. According to Wang Yongtai's words, General Zhou should not have been attacked by the thief. In a little while, I will go to the city with my virtuous brother to take a trip, lest the old man look forward to it, saying we are unreliable. Liu Yin said, "Very good; after breakfast, I will accompany Brother Jing to the city." Today, it is okay to inform my aunt, and there will be no problem." The two talked for a moment, and Liu Yin's aunt had already sent a little maid from outside to invite them to have breakfast. Xu Jing and Liu Yin went to the outer parlor to have breakfast together. Liu Yin Ying returned to his room, and Xu Jing also changed into a white silk shirt, stood in the courtyard, looking at various flowers, the little maid holding scissors and trimming them. Liu Yin Huo walked softly from behind, changed into a light blue long shirt, put on a gauze scarf, and shook a silk fan, looking even more refined. He said with a smile: "Brother Jing, I have already informed my aunt and allowed me to accompany you down the mountain for a trip. Now, please come with me." Xu Jing was overjoyed and immediately entered the room, also changed into a turban, wore the Red Phoenix Sword, and happily bid farewell and left with Liu Yin Ying. Liu Yin Ying's aunt reminded Liu Yin to go early and return early, and not to drink alcohol. The little maid also said with a smile that the young master should go home early and not linger outside, lest the old lady look forward to it. Liu Yin Ying replied and walked out of the house with Xu Jing, strolling down the mountain. The two walked and enjoyed the mountain scenery along the way, without the hurried comings and goings of last night. Xu Jing looked at Liu Yin's elegance and refinement, with jade and jewels in front, and was ashamed of his own inferiority. He said to Liu Yin Ying, "There are many wolves here. Fortunately, we were not surrounded by wolves last night when we went back and forth." Liu Yin Ying said: "Wolves often come out on moonlit nights, and they can easily find something to eat. Sometimes it is very quiet at night, and sometimes they come out in groups during the day. This is a small certainty. (85)</p>
