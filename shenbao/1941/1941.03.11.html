<h3>蔣委員長說明　政府對於中共的態度</h3>
<p>重慶　　蔣委員長在參正會第六次會議中、對於中國共產黨藉參政員不出席問題、說明政府之態度、其詞如下、主席、各位參政員、今天中正代表政府、說明對於中國共產黨參政員向貴會所提各種條件的態度、在報告之先、有一點要說明的、就是政府對于中國共產黨的問題、本來不願作任何公開的報告、但這次中共參政員對於我們全國民意機關、國民參政會、既然正式用函電提出條件、就與他半時各種言論行動的性質不相同、因此爲國家、爲民族、爲作戰、以及爲建國的前途着想、我們此时與國民參政會、不能不有一個正式的表示、一個國家在對外作殊死戰的時候、鑒個國家民族命運所寄托的、就是紀綱舆法令、只要紀綱不遠、法令貫澈、無論遇到如何危險困難、都可以轉危爲安、獲得最後勝利、取之、如果杞綱敗壞、一切軍令个能貫澈、則雖有强大的武力、亦必歸於失敗、最後日必陷於滅亡、中國全國軍民、現在正在拚全民族的力量、從事生死存亡的鬥爭、當此千鈞一髮的時候、尤其不能不特別注重國家的紀綱與法令、使人感到異常痛心悲憤的是、同爲中華民國國民的中國共產黨人、却在此全民族抵抗侵略力爭生存的時期、向代表全國民意機關的國民參政會、先後提出了所謂「善後辦法」舆「臨時解決辦法」的兩次儼同敵體的條件、並以不出席參政會作爲要挾、這種條件的名目、已經令人驚駭不置、我們誠、不知中國共產黨、不惜舆本國政府和國民參政會立於敵對的地位、究將何以自解於國人、</p>
<p>中國政府　對於中共的事情、一向抱着隱忍寬容的政策、只要是與國家紀綱與法令沒有牴觸或妨礙的、無論政治社會或黨派問題、都主張開誠布公地提出討論、以求獲得合理的解决、此種委曲求全的苦心、無非在鞏固團結　侮的力量、達到抗建最後成功的目的、但這次中共參政員、既對全國民意機關的國民參政會、正式用函電提出條件、其性質自較他們平時各種言論行動不同、本文的主旨、也僅在概括地說明中共要求的內容與意義、並指出其錯誤所在、綜觀</p>
<p>中共要求　的內容、大概可分爲軍事、政治、與黨派三部份、所謂「善後辦法」中的第一至第八各條（包括制止「挑釁」取消一月十七日命令、懲辦「皖門事變禍首」何應欽·顧祝同·上官雲相·三人、恢復葉挺自由返任軍長、交還新四軍全部人槍、撫卹皖南新四軍傷亡將士、搬退華中「剿共軍」平毀西北「封鎖　」乃所謂關「臨時解决辦法」中的第一條）立即停止全國向共產黨「軍事進攻」和第六至第十各條（華北華中西北防地維持现状、再成立）集團軍、與十八集團軍共轄六軍、釋放葉挺回任軍職、釋放皖南被捕斡部、撫邱「死離」家屬、退還皖南被役人槍)、皆可歸納在軍事範圍之內、「善後辦法」中的第九條（釋放被捕「愛國政治犯」)和第十二條（逮捕「親日派」首領交國法審判）、及「臨時解決法」中的第三至第五各條（立即停止對新華日報之「壓迫」承認陜甘　邊區之</p>
<p>合法地位　承認口後之「抗口民主政權」）皆可歸納在政治範圍之內、其餘「善後辦法」中的第十第十一兩條（廢止「一黨專政」气實行民主政治、實行民主義、服從總理遣囑、）及「臨時解決辦法」中的第十一第十二兩條（成立各黨派聯合委員會、中共代表加入參政會主席團、）則可歸納在黨派範圍之內、根據上述的內容、就軍事部份而言、我們可以看出中共的意思、要政府對於已經違令抗命的叛變軍隊、不得明令制裁、否則就要懲辦政府軍事當局、而日還要赔償叛軍的損失、就政治部份而言、他們要求在國民政府行政系統以外、劃出特殊的區域、承認特殊的政治體制、而且要限制政府對於公私團體與個人的不法行動、也不得依法取締、還要政府承認其所謂「日後民生政機」尤其　以下接第四版</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>松岡準備報聘德義</h3>
<p>日外相松岡即將報聘德義以及蘇聯的傳說，自二月下旬即有所聞，並傳松岡將與德使沃圖同行赴歐；日本政府方面，雖至今仍保持神秘的緘默，沃圖亦已於前午單獨起程，而柏林消息傳來，則此說業經官方文告爲之徵實，故松岡的訪德當不過是時間的問題。這一動態，可以視爲日本與軸心國勾結加緊的新階段，同時也是太平洋局勢張弛不定中間的一個新的警號。</p>
<p>日前所業已公布的消息，是松岡準備先後訪問柏林羅馬，前此所傳赴蘇訂的之說反寂然無聞，又據日前國際社所傳，松岡親吿美記者魏剛之言，亦謂此行係報德義之聘，而與斯達林會商一節並不在計劃之中。假如說對於外交辭令只有從反面看纔能探取其眞實意義，則對蘇外交無髯到許是松岡此行的重要任務之一。在日本與德義之間，雙方業已存在着同盟關係，彼此又都有加强勾結的欲求，此際所尙待商決者只是一些實際的與技術的問題，其間並無何等重大困難需要松岡親自出馬去打破；而蘇日關係之迄無進展，到是日本在發動新的冒險行動前夜所深切苦慮着的難題。是以此度日方縱不是一味倚靠松岡以打破對蘇外交僵局，至低限度，亦必在報聘德義而外更具有對蘇的重大幻想。而且，德日聯繫的加緊自不免使置身二國之間的蘇聯發生重大疑慮；即如三國盟的的締結，亦復小能不在條文之中苦心孤詣的揮入第五條的但書，以免激起蘇方深切反感；則在松岡聘德之際，假如不是同時也對蘇聯作平行的運用，必適足刺激克里姆林宮的當局，使蘇日締的希望更形渺茫，這當然決不是此際日當局的初意。日前曾傳松岡認爲日本對蘇如能簽訂令人滿意的協定，必須渠親自一行，那絕不會與其在準備中的赴歐一舉無所關聯。</p>
<p>松岡的預備赴歐，表面上似乎日本尙不致在太平洋立即有所動作，而且也表現着其南進的必要準備尙未完成；然而此舉本身，無論其主要目標着重在對德或對蘇，都同樣是日本向着未來冒險行動的更進一步。當前此不久，英美對於遠東危機加以嚴重關切和防範的時候，日當局曾竭力辯解，並以種種姿態從事運用，諸如松岡調停歐戰的建議，野村暫緩提出解決日美糾紛建議的表示，允其是重光與英當局的一再接觸，並提出日本不準備攻擊英帝國任何部分的保證，都是意在鬆弛全世界的緊張和悸動、把那種緊張諉爲民治國家的自相驚擾。而民治國家一部人士，亦因日方此等姿態而驟抱樂觀，這也許就是日當局對於松岡聘德一事迄今仍復諱莫如深的原因；如果不是德方因爲感到興奮滿意而予以公布，那種樂觀空氣容或會延續到聘德一行的登程。其實自從去冬以來，日當局縱曾一再聲言願意調整對夾美的外交關係。但却從未忽略明白表示其將以三國盟的爲對外政策的基調；即在最近力謀緩和英美關係的節段中，對法越則肆行脅迫，對大洋洲則露其覬覦，初不必俟諸聘德一舉的徵實纔得確認日本的未來動向。而聘德之由醖釀進於實現，適又無異於昭示日本與軸心深相結納並準備新的冒險的決心，對於英美的反響和壓力均已無復措意。另一方面，假如國際間對於遠東仍舊還有綏靖主義的殘餘存在的話，則際此亦當已失却其幻想的最後根據</p>
<p>窺測日方用意、大概一方利用外交姿態緩和英美的戒備，同時則積極推進其必要的設施和準備；對於德國，因爲所謂春季攻勢發動在即，雙方需要有更進一步的聯繫，久無結果的對蘇關係亦復亟待解決，以是乃有聘歐計畫的決定，在禮貌上的報聘而外，主要是爲了促進此等工作的完成。在日本與軸心國家之間，雙方相需正殷，不難一拍即合，可信松岡必能遂行其加緊勾結的使命。至於蘇日關係，却因最近種種變化而愈益增進此一問題的複雜性，固然巴爾幹的新形勢與蘇聯對於其西疆的關切可能加强其與日本和平相處的要求，但蘇德關係的新變化却又使德國居間斡旋的功能大爲减低，如果最近所傳蘇聯與英美的接近趨勢非盡子虛，則蘇聯對於足以促成日與英美關係破裂的外交步驟自不能不加以更大的攷慮。是以松岡此行，雖得視爲已經失掉了最有利的時機，其究竟能吾獲有重大成就，仍須視民治各國能吾於此作敏捷有效的對策。</p>
<p>演變所極，就可以養成　外患　入之機、而謀奪取政　之實的大禍亂、就黨派部份而言、他們要求祇有中國共產黨、纔可以在國民參政會中有特殊的地位與特殊的權利、而其他各黨派和　誡派的參政員、不得與中共亨受一律平等的待遇、否則中共就拒絕出席、他們這兩次條件的眞意如此、政府如果隨便加以接受、則中國還成一個什麽國家、國民參政會也還成一個什麽民意機關、中國國民政府一貫的政策、就是要軍隊國家化、換　之、在國民政府統轄之下、只有一個國家軍隊的系統、決不能有第二個私黨私人的東隊系統、本人已經切實聲明、國民革命軍乃是國家的軍隊、而不是任何一黨的軍隊、更不能將國民革命軍的一部、認作共產黨一黨的軍隊、軍令而可以</p>
<p>分而為二、則何以自別於日人扶植下的軍事組織，這不僅爲國民政府所不容、亦爲全國國民所深惡痛絕、效忠抗建的中國共產黨何忍出此、其次在政治方面、國民政府一向以政治民主化爲努力的目標、凡在國家法律與政令之下、無論國民個人與團體、只要各守紀律、各負責任、各　　務、各　　利、則人人皆有其自由、但一國之內、　不能有兩個政權、倘在國民政府之外、另外成立一個政權、例如此　條件內之所謂「口後民主政權」、如此割裂國家的政權、又何以異於日人扶植下的政治組織、不但爲政府所不容，亦經爲全國國民所痛恨、而　不與之兩立的、再次關於黨派問題、中國雖因歷史演進的　果、而在事實上有執政黨與在野黨之分、以及各黨勢力大小、與歷史久暫的不同、但其精神是</p>
<p>一律平等</p>
<p>的、尤其在民意機　的國民參政會內、祗有國民的立塲、沒有黨派的立塲、決不能讓任何一黨或個人、在會內有特殊的地位與任何權利的要求、以致斵喪尙在萌芽中的民主政治的根基、自從民國二十七年第十八集團軍不聽統帥部命令、擅自撤到黃河右岸、不久又非法佔了綏德等地、當時中國政府當局的　察、並不以爲這完全是受中共指使、亦不認此爲中共有破壞抗建之意、而該軍對中央軍令不能絕對尊重、或亦並不一定有破壞抗建、擾亂後方的　個計劃、但是該軍此種行動影　所及、竟使全國人心不安、無形中造成牽動全局、乃至為口入張　、危害規家的極端惡劣影響、這兩年餘以來、中國政府一方面要</p>
<p>統率全軍、在前方努力作戰、一方面又不能不在西爾和四北大後方的抗建根據地、作安定內部的佈　、實爲古今中外歷史上所米有之悲痛的戰史、但中國政府率而有這兩年餘時間的戒備、卒使前後方幸無隕越、實爲無上的宰事、倘在二年以前、並不及時準備、也許現在西南與西北的抗建大、後方即使不遭口軍乘隙侵入、亦將爲敗類所破壞搖撼、而大後方的民衆、亦將如現在冀察魯蘇各淪陷區的人民一樣、不能得到地方政府和國家軍隊的保護、要受重重的壓迪和蹂躪了、然而爲要安定後方的綠故、而不得不使多數本可開至前方作戰的軍隊留置後方、這實在是中國作戰力量上莫大的損失、要免除這種不必要的損失、就只有希望</p>
<p>中共方面</p>
<p>幡然悔悟、改變過去的態度與行動、不將第十八集團軍當作一黨私有的電隊、用爲牽制友軍妨碍抗建的工具、中共在民幽二十六年九月所發表的宣言上、會經聲明四點、（一）中山先生的三民主義爲中國今日之必需、本黨（共黨自　）願爲其澈　　現而奮鬥、（三）取淸一切推　中國國民黨政權的政策及運動、停止以暴力沒收地主土地的政　、（三）取淸蘇　埃政府、實行民續政淸、以期錢國政權之統一、（四）取消紅軍名義及　號、改編爲國民革命軍、受國民政府軍富委員會之統轄、中共今後倘能照此四點切市嚴行、使與中共有關的軍隊、依照軍事委員會的命令與計劃、集中於指定區域、與全國友軍親愛精誠、</p>
<p>和衷共濟</p>
<p>忠實執行作戰任務、則全國軍隊共同一致向前禦侮、後方旣無牽制、又無任何顧慮，所有國軍乃得儘量調赴前方、對口軍加以猛攻、這樣必能在短期間內獲得最大的驚人勝利、使失地早日收復、各戰區受苦的人民早日得到解放、這就是中國共產黨與第十八集團軍、對國家民族莫大的貢戲、而具愛國的精神與功績、亦必爲全國軍民所崇敬而永垂不朽了、還有在道裏　當略加糾正的、便是中共參政員所提出的所謂「制止挑釁」、「撤退　中勦共軍」、「立即停止全國向我軍事　攻」這三條、這種顚倒黑白、淆亂視聽的惡意宣傳、不僅誣蔑政府、有意破壞抗建的神聖使命、而且是汚辱了整個民族團結　　的饒潔精神、中開全口朝野軍民、只知一致、</p>
<p>力抗外侮</p>
<p>決不忍心再見所謂「　共」的軍事、更不忍以後再有此等不祥名詞、留於中國歷史之中、中國政府對於忠實將士、愛護惟恐不遠、決沒有所謂挑　」「進攻」、自戕手足之理、任何軍隊即使以往偶有過失、祇要能俊悟前非、自此率命守法、政府亦必寬大爲懷不咎旣往、但如有抗命亂紀、破壞抗建的行爲、如從前新四軍所爲的那麽爲了國家利益與抗建前途、不論其爲那一支軍隊都必須受到依法懲治的處分，本人已經向國民參政會負責保證、以後決無「動共」的軍事，並請出席各參政員本精誠團結共同禦侮的精神、向中共參政員懇切勸勉、希望他們能一反過去的態度、出席會塲、從長討論他們所要提出的問題、並且允許凡參政會爲解決這一次事件所有決議、規定政府應如何處理的、政府必將毫不猶豫地、</p>
<p>全部接受</p>
<p>澈底執行、總之、政府對於這次事件、只要能達到團結一致作戰到底的目的、一切問題皆願聽從、我們國民參政會依據公衆民意來補充、至於對中共各參政員、更希望其在此國無嚴盒的時　，能本「兄弟　于　外　其侮」的精神、毅然決然接受我們參　會公衆的意思、精試團結、共赴困難、使我們全國團結作戰的精神、不致有絲　遺憾，而能堅持貫澈、始終無間、我們爲愛護中國共產黨、爲成全他們此項共同作戰勝利的歷史、一定要督促他們始終一致團結到底、來完成抗建的使命，這是兄弟今天代表政府、要向大會懇切聲明、並盼參政會諸君衷誠諒鍳、實爲至幸、（八日電）</p>

<h3>蔣夫人「三八節」　勉婦女界演詞</h3>
<p>重慶　蔣夫人今在「三八」婦女節紀念大會發表演說、原文云、今天我們慶祝國際婦女節、七七以來這是第四次了、我們在中國的婦女、對於戰時情形此歐洲人民更加熟悉、因爲在歐洲於戰爭烽火之中過婦女節、還不過是第二次、我們以中國婦女的立塲、說今年今日的婦女節、較之過去更爲重要了、我們中國人稱這個「三八」紀念日爲國際婦女節、所謂「節」是含有紀念和慶祝鼓舞的意思的、今日國際現象使我們中國婦女感覺比過去十二個月大爲不同、兩年前的國際景象是足以令人沮喪的、甚至是黑暗的、一年前的景象是危疑不定的、今日則面對光明、有新的希望、今天這個國際節、僅有民主國家才是眞正和我們一起來慶祝、因爲所有民主國都已明瞭反侵略的世界戰爭的最高目的是什麼、這些國家現在已一致認識、無論何時、無論何地、凡是一個國家的自由和民主主義被人侵犯、其他的每個民主國的人民、都應該考慮到這種威脅、是國繫他們生存基礎的、侵略者向一個地方進攻、不過是侵略者的一種詭計、它想將全世界慢慢地一口一口吞下去、現在他門遇到了全世界民主國的團結和堅强反抗、這是他們所夢想不釗的、</p>
<p>中國向世界上申訴　經將有了四年了、我們請求友邦認識民主團結的重要性、比請求他人幫助更為迫切、民主國家應該集中人力物力來應　這個人類共同的禍害、世界人民對這種申訴、先前是充耳不聞、現在已經因備嘗經騐而注意了、他們明白侵略集團要準備　時瓜分這個世界、人們也明白如果要打倒這個侵略集團、被　略者的團結一致是最要緊的、爲使這種團結堅强而有力、對於祗顧一個國家的自山利益、應該視爲不合時的狹隘主義、這個理想各民主國雖然還不能完全實現、但至少已能對中國的堅苦奮鬥表示同情、多認中國是他們的先鋒、我們中國的胞今天對這個國家長象、不論男女同胞都歡圻鼓舞、尤其是婦女界得到海外傳來的消息、知道世界民主國的婦女、每一個人都衷心表示同情中國抗建、十分瞭解中國在抗建中奮鬥的重要、特別是美國婦女、成立了一個援助中國婦女委員會、參加者有多數　國最　名的婦女、在雜斯福總統夫人領導之下、她們以誠摯　　愛的　度、對中國婦女表示敬慕　深長的友愛、表明她們與我們站在同一地位、一致支持我們的立塲、她們所給予我們的幫助、以及正在準備對我們的幫助、都是以這種同舟共濟的精神來幫助的、不是僅僅爲局外旁觀者的回情而已、另外她們還有兒童運動幫助我們救濟難黨、</p>
<p>現値國民參政會在戰時首都開會、女參政員已增至十六人參與其間、其中目有一人參與主席團、我們與世界各國　會裏的女代表人數相較、已佔多數、這表顯中國婦女已獲得國家　高的地位、反觀日本婦女在公家　業上絕無地位可佔、其地全體主戰的國家也同樣不許他們婦女有合理的自由、不許他們婦女表現她們的思想能力的機會、兩者對照、這又是極可注意的一件事、過去許多民主國的婦女　　、往往與男子作無謂的鬥爭、祗知抗議而漠親了在許多國民生活上表現她們的實際能力、中國婦女亦犯同一毛病、常常爲要求參加某種職業而爭持、</p>
<p>我相信戰事結東之後、中國婦女可以充分得到與男子的回等地位、理由就是因爲我們婦女在打仗時期、已經表現了能力對國家有了相當的貢獻、我以爲現在不是從容討論理論的時候，而是要一致起來實際表現我們婦女能力和貢獻、並不下於男子、現在經濟作戰較之軍事更加重要、我們中國婦女同胞對戰爭的貢獻亦須改進、從前注重救護傷兵慰勞軍隊救濟難重的工作，這當然很有價值、但我想我們更應該向生產力面發展、允其是農業牛產、就婦女的本性說、這種工作是很適宜的、因爲勸導和說服在婦女木身較之男子就有更大的耐性、更大的感應力、婦女在家庭裏當主婦、因爲負了管理家庭經濟的責任、所以對「勤儉」一字的　義和方法、格外有經騐、在此白物昂貴時期、家庭婦女　於食品選擇的用心、可以說是　民族　個最有價値的貢獻、切勿當作一件日常瑣細的事情、</p>
<p>我們中國同胞向來有「廢物利用」的本領營養專家沈本博士曾說「牛的食料人也，可食用」草料飼料的隨便遺棄、殊屬可惜、若能善加調製、可以製成最佳的食品、登最高貴的筵席、所以家庭婦女應該在物品的精選和利用上面、苦心想法來維持一般的生活、這比之科學家發明燃料及其他需要物爲代替品一樣有價値、舊時中國婦女地位之低落、或者雞免有言過其實的地方、實際上中國歷史上就有不少偉大的女性、但是我們希望將米中國婦女地位的增高、不獨要和其他民主國婦女一樣、而且要勝過她們、把　　這個信念、我們應該從今天起、立定決心、說明我們對於轉移國運的工作、與男子有同等的能力、證明我們確有能力和志氣來行使我們救國的權利、（八日電）</p>

<h3>國際軼事（九）　美國準備凍結外資</h3>
<p>這篇是紐約泰晤士報的紀載，茲譯錄如下：</p>
<p>美國財政部現擬依據被侵略各國在美資金限制提取辦去，進一步「凍結」各國在美全部資金，並已與紐約華盛頓兩地聯邦儲備銀行合作，擬就命令，一俟羅斯福總統簽字，即可付諸實施。此舉目的，在使德國日本及其他軸心國的資金不得自美國流出流入。德國和瑞士的資金最近自　國源源流出，就是預防這種步驟。</p>
<p>加拿大，蘇聯，瑞士，拉丁美洲，遠東及歐洲各國，在美國各有多少存款，並無倘別的精確統計。聯邦　備銀行曾在一九三九年八月，即這次歐戰爆發前一月，作過一度估計。據稱，各國在美存金，美元存款和直接簡接投資，的共八，四〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。其中加拿大佔一，〇七〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，瑞士佔一，二五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，蘇聯佔一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，歐洲其他各國佔二，七五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，拉丁美洲各國佔一，〇九〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元　遠東各國佔一，一一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，德國雖僅佔一六〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，但瑞士與其他各中立國的存款中，或許有德國存款在內。</p>
<p>截至本年一月十五日爲止，外國政府及外國銀行在美國聯邦儲備銀行十二家分行的存款，連同被侵略各國已「凍結」的存款在內，共計一，二二九，八一二六，〇〇〇美元，其中外國銀行在聯邦儲備銀行各分行的存款共計六六四，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，內有六〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美允存在紐約。但外國商界與私人在各該銀行，以及紐約各商業銀行均存有大宗美元，都未計算在內。</p>
<p>至於各國存在美國的黃金，的値一，八〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，其中多數已由政府下令「凍結」。英國方面在美存金，僅値二〇五，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元。</p>
<p>美國政府原來的限制提存辦法，僅適用於被德國蘇聯全部或一部份佔領的各國，以免侵略國將被佔領國的存款據爲已有。但德義日等國仍得使用種種方法將存款過戶，中立國人民也可代替軸心各國提取款項。新命令實施後，各國在美資金，將和挪威，丹麥，荷蘭，比利時，盧森堡，法國，拉脫維亞，愛沙尼亞，及立陶宛各國在美的資金一般，受同株的限制。「凍結」範圍包括（一）外滙交易，（二）存款過戶，（三）金銀硬幣通貨三者的支付，出口及提取，（四）各種資產的轉議，提取及出口。</p>
<p>至於美國對其所同情的各國政府，則可儘量予以通融，但對中立國的中請，自可從　審査，以防流弊。</p>

<h3>西報為日外相策畫　先赴英美觀光　方知民主陣綫之眞實力量　如聽從希特勒恐不堪設想</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報昨有社論、評論日外相松岡洋右訪聘德　之行、內容頗爲犀利、略謂、松岡洋右已宜布將應邀訪聘柏林及羅馬、世人對此之第一想自將為軸心名國將準備對英學行全面總攻擊、無論希特勒對其黨羽提出之建議如何、英國決不致豪無貯備、必能　時隨　應戰也、故如松岡對於希特勒仍唯命是聽、冒然進攻民主國者、則其不可設想之後果、除松岡及日本外、將無他人能負其貴、</p>
<p>先游美國　見聞較切</p>
<p>松岡現尙未啟程、徵之已往之信用、除非其火車確已開行外、吾人殊未敢斷言松岡將有德義之行、吾人現在尙有時間、可向其建議與其取道西伯利亞、不知經過美國、必可得較多之經騐吾人茲請松岡第一程先在火奴魯魯停驂一日、以見識美國巨大之艦隊、第二程作橫渡美洲大陸之旅行、即可見一萬三千萬人民正在趕造民主國家之偉大兵工廠、無數之工廠、一路連綿、烟雲冲天、三千數百英里之綠野田禾、產五穀之豐、足以沉沒淹溺島國之各局、男男女女生活水準之富裕、及其援救民主政治之決心、</p>

<h3>論集錦照相　郎靜山</h3>
<p>照相之稱爲集錦者，乃集合多數底片之景物，而放映於一張　紙上也，　以一底片中，每因局部景物之不適人意，遂致全部俱廢，若集合各底片之良好部份，予以適宜之接合，則相得益彰：非獨可使廢片景物化爲理想之境地，此即集錦照相之目的也。其法始見於廣告，或照片遊戲中，但皆剪貼各種景物，拚湊而成，或爲各種異想天開之事物，令人發噱，然其拚湊痕跡，瞭然可見，若細玩之，則味同嚼蠟矣。而集錦照相則不然，雖同一拚合，但經作者於放映時之意匠與手術經營之後，遂覺天哀無縫，其移花接木，旋乾轉坤，恍若出乎自然，適非剪貼拚湊者所可比擬也。此亦即吾國繪驚之理法，今日始實施於照相者也。爰述其意義與方法如次，以資同好者之研究焉。（未完）</p>

<h3>糧食　何樂而不爲米蠹囤老虎　一舉手暴利五千餘萬元　米質越賣越惡劣米價越抬越高唾罵由他唾罵造孽錢吾自賺之</h3>
<p>邇來一路暴漲混亂不堪之米市、無日不漲、有米不開、將及匝月、悍然不顧一切、危害民食、縱無强暴脅迫之行動、而大戶米商、不將米糧應市、迹近「同盟罷市」、罪有浮於强暴脅迫、而强暴脅迫危害民食、倒觸犯刑章、此則不但逍遙法外、且經此次暴漲之後、洋米每百包貼價最高至二千五六百元、最近仍有二千二三百元、如照成本扯算、每包要賺三十餘元、故上海米商大戶於此次把持不出橫抬市價之一舉、大概不勞而獲暴利五千數目萬元之數、皆同吾數百萬人身上剝來、如此發財、千古示有、怪不得唾罵由他唾罵、造孽錢吾自賺之、</p>
<p>洋米黑市貼價。昨雖回降二·三·四元、而惶恐不可終日之緊張情况、不動分毫、葢所漲過鉅、所跌甚微、况心存叵測之大戶客囤、若無切實整理米市之辦法、豈肯就此放鬆、稍留一些口糧給全市民以延殘喘、此輩財迷心竅之大商鉅賈、決不能有此「慷慨」最可恨、米、越賣越惡劣、價越抬越高、還要向食戶施恐嚇、橫說堅說、米糧來源要斷、嚇得一般食戶、買則無錢、不買則心中別別亂跳、而一般米蛀蟲見了哭喪臉的買戶、反嘻嘻的笑。甚至還要罵聲</p>
<p>「屈死」、出了三千餘文買一升米吃、反遭米蛀蟲辱罵、又好像拿了錢去向米蠹蟲乞米、問他一聲、米這樣壞、馬上給你顏色看、要、買了去、不要、算了、有得買米吃還算好了、</p>
<p>天下老鴉一般黑、囤米的虎狼成性、賣米的從中蠹蝕、害煞了大眾生活、至今猶未嚴重局勢、即如昨早市開市後、實消已因價高而呆、途貨新由太古怡和兩船到萬包外、尚有法輪等三四船接踵進口、人心立平、小絞每百包貼價自二千三百元降至二千一百元、西貢一二號每百石貼價二千二百元降至二千元、碎米自每百石貼一千一百元降至一千元、　　一號米每一市石開九十九元、形勢平定、後忽又引起南洋內地等客戶趁小問津、新囤亦乘小吸收、全日交易本街不足三千元、客囤則有五千包、</p>
<p>洋米繼續湧到、法公司金第亞輪、由西貢直接運來洋米一千二百五十噸、約合一萬三千包、前日（九日）晨抵埠、停靠虹口華順碼頭起卸、又渣華公司Tjiieboet號輪、由香港裝來洋米一千噸約一萬零五百包、停靠浦東藍烟囪碼頭起卸、法公司之巴格維爾號輪、亦由西貢運米來滬、原定昨日到滬、但至晚尚未見進口、約今日可到、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米到貨雖仍有限、但聞塲外洋米暗盤挫折、人心頓亦變退、作客方面旣感處高臨危、又恐局勢驟變、鮮有進取、一般貨主際此環境、欲扳無能、售意薄粳行情均見回落二三元、計開崑山斛見白粳一百二十一元、高粳一百二十二元半、常幫斛見眞特粳一百二十七八元、高白粳一百二十四元、青角斛見薄稻一百二十元至一百十八元、飛來鳳一百二十元零五角、</p>
<p>糯米在洋米暗盤、　羽聲中、因其不受限例、部轉移目光、着意於此、致使去路反廣、貨主扳俏異常、市價獨見挺　二元左右、香港眞眞特別團粒白糯竟穿出一百元大關、開一百零二元、大市貨自一百元至九十八元、中次九十七元半至九十六元、</p>
<h3>粉市先漲後平</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日紛市上午開市、承週末餘風、業內外客囤、依然競爭購買、投機活動殊烈、鐘樓牌澳粉開盤三十一元五角、躍至三十二元五角、霎時抬高元許、金龍牌坎粉三十元勢頗爲緊張、惟華廠平賣粉已於昨日開始正式供應、本街五千八百七十三包、阜豐廠以原料中斷暫停供給、其不足之數、仍以洋粉搭配、且米價漲後回挫、人心稍懈、故後市現洋粉實銷頓减、客囤亦止進爲吐、市面回鬆二三角、據業中人觀察、目下整票洋粉尚有三五十萬包、不日可到、若無市儈任意拉抬、市面即有回低之勢云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况仍堅、內地杜麥仔到兩枯、日廠雖圖放價、亦難搜羅、華廠進胃更以無貨可收、無形停辦、市面在此冷靜中、殊爲沉寂云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　旣囤米　又囤雜糧</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油豆市况、苞米又以囤戶替某方宣傳南進空氣而續漲元譜、豆餅內地實銷萌動、及囤戶乘機囤積、故市價續挺半元左右、計成交元隆餅三車、價爲十六元五角半至八角、肥字餅三車、價爲十六元四角至八角、甡記餅四千片、價爲十六元四角至八角、利字餅三千片、價爲十六元至五角、其他起小回風、葢以浮散囤戶稍有吐售、因之市面稍少壓低、計黃另一半跌五六角、花生油平定、豆油現貨跌二元、期貨先跌二元外、又轉升、但結果仍比上週末挫跌元譜、又（十一日）出口、有豆子八百包、運往新加坡、又有豆餅五千四百五十塊、運往香港、</p>
<h3>金融　美匯獨鬆　期貨尤甚</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、走勢見鬆、葢日來世界時局、益爾戰爭氣氛、經營者認爲利空。投機商售出甚夥、現美匯佔半、三月份亦多、惟英行如有利·麥加利等步吸。供求尚平、成交價大致爲五元五三一二五、午收一度回平、晚刻仍硬、結果現美匯告五元五三一二五、先令三辨士三七五、比上週六收美軋鬆〇三一二五、英匯則平、至本月份尤鬆長〇六　五、</p>
<p>華商　行售出</p>
<p>晨初、匯　英對美滬等均平、美對英滬等亦未更動、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士三七五、美匯五元半、悉與上週六晚收價相同、開後市面硬化、因華商銀行俱懷賣意、先後售出現美匯、計英行麥加利吸入價五元五三一二五、九點半匯豐掛牌各匯勿動、白銀平衡無上落、此後投機商亦跟踪塞出、惟有利等肯納、勢尚平衡、計三月份美匯有利入投機商價五元五三一二五、迨至午收、以投機商等止出。頭寸較緊、價復回軟、午收現美匯爲五元半、先令三辦士三七五、</p>
<p>匯豐曾有收進</p>
<p>後市投機商又來賣出、初由華行如華人等購去、現貨價告五元五三一二五、後聞匯豐亦會吃進、三月份美匯五元五三一二五、均係投機商所出、延至晚收、市面仍硬、現貨及本月份英金三辦士三七五、美匯五元五三一二五、下月份英金三辦士三五九三七五、美匯五元半、比上星期六收市英匯期貨現均平、美匯現貨及下月份長〇三一二五、本月份鬆〇六二五、</p>
<p>香港申匯下降</p>
<p>香港十日（週一）電、今晨匯市開盤平定、英美日各匯俱無榮辱、申匯現貨降二元、爲四百四十二元、十一時三十分告平、申匯現貨續降五角、爲四百四十一元五角、</p>

<h3>消息利空　金市銳跌</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、跌勢漸形銳利、已退入六千三百元內、照報載消息國內利買、美參院通過租借法案、又和賣方、投機家未敢輕易落手、故於晨開後供求相應、價盤於六千三百元左右、曾升至六千三百〇八元、變動微小、詎見恒記成記忽來巨額套賣、展開跌勢。因匯票商復進、尚不脫盤局、下午大豐德孚亦起傾出、美匯起鬆勢、於晚收前跌勢突勁、退見六千二百三十元低價、終見軋小八十元、全日交易約二萬兩、各方人心稍帶不定、現金上午一大售予祥和五十兩、價照期交高四百二十元、下午成記一大再售予祥和一百十兩、高四百三十元、飾金盤小十元、計六百八十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚亦猛跌八十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、美金微硬、市勢較疲、九點十五分、開市即退至六千三百元關口、比上週六午收價低二十元、在賣勢下又遍至六千二百九十元、大成永誠達買進、抬升至六千三百〇八元、忽見恒記與成記來傾售、德孚公和亦爭賣、外匯帶鬆、且有香港幫吐售之訊、價逐步降三十八元、遜至六千二百七十元、祥和同康承順源買進、新豐永復進千餘兩、午刻始至六千二百九十五元、午收六千二百九十三元、下午二點開市、即高七元、爲六千三百元、後呈步跌難四之勢、乃外匯美金步鬆、大豐德孚亦起巨額傾售、恒紀亦爭售不止、價竟盤小七十元、中途僅十元左右廻旋、降見六千二百三十元低價、未幾收市六千二百四十元、比上週六午收猛跌八十元、照三月美金五元五三一二五結價、爲六千二百九十五元計撳五十五元、收後升至六千二百四十五元、全日有七十八元上落、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高四百五十元、收進减八十元、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>飾金終掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行晨十點二十五分掛小十元、至六百八十元、下午二點半升至六百九十元、四點重見掛落、爲六百八十元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣上落甚微</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價盤旋趨下、英美金鎊因赤各跌二元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票步趨低落、晚市退爲十七元九角半、比上週軋跌一角、香港票略趨軟勢、日金票稍起回風、晚市退爲一元八角八分、朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站平、晚市仍站一元五角五分、</p>
<h3>證券　內債多方　餘勇可賈</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况、因環境不利、市價驟跌、勢將打破六元關、但以多方業已積重難反、乃再賈其餘勇、竭力拉抬、不使進關、居然奏效、午後乃再行抬高丁種、因丁種比較爲便宜也、於是各項乃亦隨之稍高、乃多方終不肯即此放鬆故耳、市價結果高低互見獨丁種好五角半、甲種略好五分、乙丙小四角、成交約二百四五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、股票交易、成交新新公司股一百股價爲廿元、正</p>

<h3>紗花　補空與新買並來　紗市向上　但銷實依然零落</h3>
<p>下跌兩日之紗布、昨剛因消息好轉、人心重趨向上、空頭紛起扒補、及新貿者復來、市况乃漸增高、但實際交易、另星採買尚不間斷、不過躉批仍乏發展能力、而市態　稍穩固、二十支雙馬高價爲一千三百七十元、低價爲一千三百六十一元、午後因人氣熱烈、初做價爲一千三百八十六元、繼　聞外匯放長、標金回跌、證券幫空頭加碼、市盤轉跌至一千三百六十八元、最低價爲一千三百七十一元、今日有棉紗十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、人氣溫善、首盤價一千三百六十五元、少頃微跌至一千三百六十一元、且有一部份議論、謂北海日軍已撤退、該縣航線恢復、買者頗不乏人、市盤漸漸上升至一千三百七十五元、豈料金價下降、人心稍虛、又復會跌至一千三百六十二元、旋買方　態仍濃厚、檯面尙緊、陸續漲至一千三百七十八元收盤、查辦日漸成交統計八千四百八十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>棉市形同停頓</h3>
<p>現棉情况呆滯如恒、各方心思暗淡乏勁、因之棉市益覺荒凉矣、</p>
<p>紐約棉市因棉布貿易、一再良好、及紡織業繼續買進遠期、故市况活潑而興奮、結果收盤價格、較之上日進二至十磅音不等、</p>
<p>印棉仍無多大漲落、昨日預測較小半羅比、</p>

<h3>禮</h3>
<p>— 魯漢</p>
<p>大概是死了什麼人吧，父親命我去送一份禮。做喜事耍送禮，死了人也要送禮，婚，喪，喜，慶，年禮，節禮，中國人的禮實在不少！送了禮買一頓喜酒吃吃還有意思，也有人送了禮去買一頓豆腐皮吃吃嗎？不是的，封袋上明明寫着「代箔」兩字，這是送給死人的。我覺得奇怪，難道死人眞的會從棺材裏伸出手來嗎？</p>
<p>年紀也不小了，可是這種事情我還是第一次經塲，父親於是鄭重其事的，正經的把進門規矩，出門禮貌，一切禮節，全套門檻，詳群細細，原原本本的敎給了我，並且還叫我去向那個死人叩幾個頭。眞是笑話，我連死的是什麽人還不知道，和我有什麼關係我更不明白，我和他生小相識，死了，郤要我無緣無故的去向他叩頭，行禮，眞使我莫明其妙。</p>
<p>走進了喪宅，雖然不像走進了衙門，走上了閻王殿，却也莊嚴肅穆得有些可怕；雖不像上朝時的三跪九叩，禮節却也相當的繁複隆重。在嗚嗚的哀樂聲中，人們一個個被『引』宇引到了靈前，叩頭，跪拜，鞠躬。眞出我意料之外，『引』字例外地把我引到了賬房，我眞在僥倖着自己的被人優待，驚奇着自己被人另眼看待，我想他們眞聰明，居然猜到了我的心裏，赦免我去做我不願做的事請，——向一個不認識的死人行禮，引我的人說了聲送禮，裏面答　了一聲，我知道這是送禮的地方了，就呈上了那個包藏着兩塊錢的代箔的封袋，裏面授出了一張紙頭和兩毛大洋。呀！我險些驚叫了出來，原來他們把我當作一個傭人</p>
<p>我呆住了，沒有伸手，也不知道怎麼回答，那人好像猜透了一般下人的心理似的說。。「拿了罷！」一面向我帶着輕蔑而又狡猾地一笑，好像在說還要裝客氣嗎？我這時又氣，又恨，又慚愧，我正想向他辯白，我不需要這兩毛錢，可是誰來相信你呢？我低下頭來，看一看自己補了的長衫，破了的鞋子，有誰來相信你不是一個傭人呢？嚴格說來，一般傭人的衣衫恐怕比我還體面一些呢！他們還抬舉我呢！傭人也是人，算不得侮辱了我，這樣反好，免了我去叩那種小自然的頭，兩毛錢也樂得拿的。</p>
<p>回到了家中，從頭至尾訴說了一遍，母親生氣，父親嘆氣，懊悔不該差了我道個笨伯去鬧道　個大笑話。我只有恨。恨他們只認衣衫小認人，狗眼看人低。掏出了那張謝帖和兩毛錢，呀！　不得了了，把禮都送錯了嗎？怎麼龔家的送到施家去了？大家的幌經都集中到謝帖上，原來一個寺院裏有好幾家做喪事呢！眞該死！又是一陣臭駡和嘆氣。父親駡我幹不來事，母親駡我眞粗心，姊姊駡我沒用，大家駡我笨。我沒有話說，只有一肚皮的恨。父親在駡：「…也不小了，人情世故，交際應酬，一些也不懂，將來自己怎麽樣的做人……！」</p>
<p>把手裏的兩毛錢撕成了幾塊。好像撕破了人們的假面具，好像撕破了什麽黑幕，也好像撕毀了一種虛僞可笑矛盾的沒有禮的『禮』，也好像報了什麼仇恨似的，心裏感到了舒服些。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>離婚前後</h3>
<p>— 李玉瑛</p>
<p>在我八歲那年，父親就過世了。虧得慈母千辛萬苦地把我扶養長大，也使我受了中等敎育。到十九歲的時候，有一位親戚來做媒，媽聽信了媒妁之言，就允了親事。在那年冬天，我結了婚，丈夫家中雖然很富有，可是丈夫的性情十分暴戾更加吃·着·嫖·賭，浪蕩成性，不務正業。在這惡劣的環境中，過了整整五年，受盡了精神上的痛苦。他把所有的遺產花完了，整天在家尋事吵架，我實在受不了這種痛苦，並且這麽下去，將來的生活，更不堪設想了。只好雙方脫離，所生一子，還只四歲，婦我扶養。因爲我不忍心把孩子交給這沒天良腐敗的父親，以免斷送了孩子的一生。</p>
<p>現在我是離婚了，可是內心的創傷是永遠磨滅不了的！我在經濟的壓迫和精神的痛苦中度着生活！</p>
<p>前數月，有一位親戚（男性）說我的生活太枯寂了，該有點正當的娛樂。他知道我手中拮据，所以連續請我看了幾次電影。我們是很坦白的，沒有一點不正當的行爲，所以也不瞞三瞞四的。我以爲看看電影是很平常的事，何况我們原來是親戚，誰知我的表姊就把這件事當作新聞，到處搬弄是非。不久，所有的親友都知道了，大家在背後任意誹謗，說什麽女子從一不從二啦；又說什麼我去引誘人家啦！種種侮辱我的話。這些陳舊頑固的話，都從年靑的受過相當敎育的人口中說出來，豈不笑話？她們非但不哀憐我遭遇的不幸，同情我，幫助我，竟處處地方來妬忌我，蔑視我。她們只揀有錢的親戚去奉承，去親熱，人情是多麼勢利，人心竟是這樣的殘酷！何况她們從前曾做過越禮的事情，現在事過境遷，難道都忘了不成？還振振有詞的來義笑人家！我的名界已經給她們破壞了，不能恢復了！倒不如趁此把我的生活改變一下，並且離婚再嫁，也不是犯法的事，現在社會上也很多。但是，我一想到表姊們將來的冷嘲熟諷，叫我如何受得了，我實在沒有這種勇氣了！</p>
<p>若是想自立，現在要找一個正當的職業，比登天還難，何况我是一個初中程度的女子，在這社會上，那有我揷足的餘地？</p>
<p>我曾經有過兩次自殺的動機：一次是爲了受不了丈夫的氣惱，以致想死；一次就是最近受到了這種不白的侮辱。我處在這麼悲慘的環境中，還要受到這意外的打擊，我只有想死，以脫離苦海！但是我死以後，以後，我的老娘和孩子，將來如何度日呢？這便我不得不把自殺的意思打消，繼續在這萬惡的世界上苟延下去。</p>
<p>每天在愁城中消麽歲月，在媽的面前，還得强裝笑容，恐怕她老人家看出我心中的悲傷，又要加重憂愁。到深夜，媽和孩子睡熟了，我才敢偷偷的哭！我只望能够變成一個麻本不仁的人，可以把一切痛苦忘了！我又像一隻迷途的羔羊，將來的生活，不知怎樣過下去？</p>

<p>— 寒竹作</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（五）　東與慾的分野</p>
<p>秋海棠在舞台是一個旦角，幾年以來，戀愛的戲劇，雖然已經搬演得快厭倦了，可是在台下，他却還是一個孤獨的少男。這並不是說，他永遠只想在台上扮一個假女人，給戴鬍子的老生和敷粉的小生做老婆便算了；同時也不能說他在台下便絕對的不需要愛。正相反地，他是太需要了！因爲自從他的老娘去世以後，他一直就過着極度孤零的生活，家裹儘管住着那麽許多的管事和手下人，但沒有一個是能够給他說合的；比較投機的祇有一個趙玉崑，偏是這傢伙歡喜喝酒，上天中祇有一兩天在家，這一兩天之中，父祇有很短的三四小時是醒着的，秋海棠自己少不得也有些應酬，這樣，兩個人就極少再有機會說話了。</p>
<p>無論秋海棠的個性是怎樣的靜默，終究還是一個二十多歲的靑年，像那慶一個枯寂而找不到一些安慰的家，他怎樣能覺得滿足呢？有了歡喜的事，沒有人可以吿訴；有了愁苦的事，沒有人可以分解；一天到晚，只是唱戲排戲，吊嗓子的一套把戲，完全像一頭被玩弄的猢　一樣。在這種情形之下，旣然他是一個人，而且又是一個正充滿着生氣的靑年人，如何不需要『愛」呢</p>
<p>那些由於看戲而對他發生某種野心的女人，在理論上講，果然是一種惡意的誘惑，但在效果上，的確也達到了一部份煽動的作用，至少已時常點醒他，自己應該需要找一個灌輸愛的對象了。</p>
<p>上年袁紹文也會以良友的資格，打算介紹一個梨園世家的少女，給秋海棠做終身伴侶，結果却沒有成功，因爲秋海棠本人不贊成。</p>
<p>「我雖然是一個唱戲的人，」他說：「可黃這幾年來，多謝你的管敎，使我在行事上和學問上，都不致跟一般在學堂裏念書的年輕人差得怎樣遠；所以我相信，我應該也有選擇一個妻子的自由。對不起得很，七爺，我不能愛那位姑娘！」</p>
<p>「那末怎樣的女人你才會歡喜呢」袁紹文笑着問。</p>
<p>「完全合我意思的女人。」秋海棠彷彿很有把握地回答。　（五一）</p>

<h3>改良崑曲之我見　貴族保守兩缺點的改進</h3>
<p>— 宋瑞楠</p>
<p>歷史是殘酷的，牠會毫不容情地將一切不合時代潮流的事物加以遺棄。戲劇也是這樣，金代的院本，元代的雜劇，明代的傳奇，都經不起歷史的洗鍊而退出了歷史舞　。現在，乾嘉時代最最走紅的崑曲，也已踏上牠的末路，在不久的將來，就會變成歷史上的陳跡了。</p>
<p>崑曲的沒落，固然是牠內在的缺點自然發展的結果，可是我們也不能吾認，牠的本身却也包涵着不少的優點。響如說，牠的唱詞，在純文學的角度看起來，是其他各種戲劇所不能望其背項的；再如劇情的動人，結構的嚴謹，音樂的配合，表演的細膩，也是其他各種地方戲所不能企及的。不過，這種種優點却抵消不了牠的二大缺點——貴族性和保守性。因爲貴族性，所以終久停留在士大夫的氛圍中，而不能普及到大衆的中間去，可是，士大夫階級的自身，也已到了日暮途窮的階段，觀衆的逐漸减少，自是意中事。同時，更因保守色彩的過於濃厚，所以終久和現階段的時代潮流脫了節——因此，崑曲逐漸沒落了。</p>
<p>可是，崑曲究竟是中國的藝術和文學上的一種奇花異卉，我們不願讓牠獨個兒和死亡搏鬭，但同時我們也不願「原封不動」地傅給子孫，我們一面得設法拯救牠，同時一面還該加以改良，使牠摒除貴族化和保守性的二大缺點，變成大衆化的現代戲劇。</p>
<p>不過還該認淸，牠是崑曲，牠有牠的根源，特性，和觀衆。牠本是紅　毺上載歌載舞的東西，所以我們不能站在違反歌舞劇的立塲來改良牠。要是遠反了牠的原則，改造的結果乃是另外的新事物，而不是改良的崑曲，結果非但不能爭取新觀衆，反而减少牠的老顧客，這一點是應加以注意的。現在就我管見所及，提供一點意見：</p>
<p>劇本的選擇　據本的內容，應以針對現實爲主題。這可以分做好幾方面來講：第一，要鼓動觀衆的愛國家愛民族的意識。例如「桃花扇」是描寫明末淸初的民族鬭爭，允其是史可法殉節的一塲，更可使人感動。蔣士銓的的「冬靑樹」則是描寫南宋末年漢人和蒙古人鬭爭的經過，其中如文天祥的不屈而見殺，謝枋得的餓死而殉國，唐珏的偷葬帝骨，都能使人油然發生愛國的情緒。再如「浣紗記」描寫越王勾踐十年生聚十年敎訓的復國仇雪國恥的苦心孤詣，看後更可以知所警惕。其次要表揚軍人的英勇。例如「鐵冠圖」中的別母亂箭二折，描寫周遇吉全家殉國的壯烈，再如「精忠記」描寫岳武穆之抗敵禦侮，又如「倒精忠」描寫宋澤的抗敵精神，都是很配合時代要求的劇本。第三，在這動蕩的大時代中，我們特別須提倡民族氣節，所以描寫蘇武出使匈奴的「牧羊記」，描寫昭君投河的「靑塚記」，及描寫費宮人報國仇的「刺虎」等劇本，都可多多上演。（未完）</p>

<h3>洗浮山的賀天保</h3>
<p>— 春</p>
<p>「洗浮山」的賀天保，是文武老生正工戲，因爲京朝派老生重文輕武，「洗浮山」就難得看到。老譚是武生底于，劉春喜是號稱文武老生，自然都會這齣戲。余叔岩武工也有相當根基，瑞德寳是黃派武生，後來兼唱譚派老生，李少春，高盛麟，李萬春，劉宗楊都是武生兼動老生戲的，所以也能演「洗浮山」。此外武牛楊盛春，李盛斌，江世升，也能唱「洗浮山」；不過是只演武塲，不帶後面「托兆」（有大段反二）。其實「洗浮山」是譚派老生應學的一齣戲，學會這一　戲，「戰太平」（代箭），「賣馬」（要　（就不難了；，連學「駡曹」的鼓，都輕便了不少，因爲「戰太平」雙刀，「賣馬」耍鐧，都從此戲中雙刀變化而來。「洗浮山」雙刀能耍得好，左右二碗的手量就平勻了。學打鼓的都是左腕無力（　菊朋就犯了此病），能够有「洗浮山」底子，就不會有這種弊病了。周嘯天的賀天保</p>

<h3>The Second National Political Council, First Session, Held Closing Ceremony Yesterday, Chairman Chiang Presided and Delivered Closing Remarks, Providing Evidence of Victory in Military, Political, and Economic Terms, Assembly Declaration Supports Government's Resistance and Nation-Building Policy</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The first meeting of the Second National Political Council held its closing ceremony at 10:00 am this morning. Chairman Chiang presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. From the perspective of the councilors, Mo Dehui gave a response. Finally, Zhang Boling read the assembly declaration, and the ceremony was concluded. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The National Political Council successfully concluded this morning. The most important issues of this meeting were the attendance conditions proposed by the Communist Party councilors and the issue of food and commodity prices. Regarding the former, Chairman Chiang delivered a speech at the assembly on the 6th, and the assembly passed two resolutions. The government, in addition to paying attention to strict discipline and upholding the law, will still be generous and maintain overall control. Regarding the grain issue, Chairman Chiang has already made it clear that it is not a question of availability, but of distribution. Once the various management agencies are organized in three months, they will be able to effectively manage and fully supply the needs of all parties. As for the price issue, the key lies in increasing production and facilitating transportation, and the government has also stepped up its efforts. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - At the closing ceremony of the Political Council this morning, Chairman Chiang's speech lasted for 38 minutes. In summary, after nearly four years of warfare, a good foundation has been established in international affairs, politics, military, and economics. Everyone must cherish this foundation, engage in practical work, and sacrifice personal interests to seek its progress. The current international situation is even more favorable to China's resistance and nation-building. Friendly nations such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can all provide substantial assistance. Now that the issue of the defense of Guanma has just been resolved, it is possible for the Nine-Power Treaty to be restored and become effective again. China's war is not only for its own survival and independence but also for democracy and peace in the Pacific. The restoration of the Nine-Power Treaty can achieve this goal. As for the Soviet Union, it is China's neighbor and crucial to Northwest transportation, so special attention should be paid to diplomacy with the Soviet Union. In the political sphere, there is already a foundation for diplomatic solutions to military conflicts, and there should be no further instability. However, ideologies such as party affiliations are no longer in line with the times and should be abolished. The government should rectify discipline and implement laws, and the councilors and the people of the country should do things realistically so that political construction can succeed. In the military field, not only have the losses and sacrifices of the past three years of warfare been fully replenished, but its strength is more than doubled compared to the beginning of the war. From now on, as long as military discipline and military orders are thoroughly implemented, there is absolutely no question about the victory of resistance and nation-building. Finally, in the economic field, Chairman Chiang attaches special importance to it and hopes that all councilors will share responsibility in promoting and implementing the resolutions of the assembly, so that the goals of resistance and nation-building can be achieved. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Today is the ninth day of the National Political Council meeting, and tomorrow is the closing ceremony. Therefore, all motions and review reports were discussed in full at the two sessions today. As for the draft closing declaration, except for some textual revisions, it has generally been passed. The main points are to strengthen support for the government, rectify discipline, and implement government orders. China's resistance and nation-building were originally for independent survival, but now, due to changes in the world situation, it has become more responsible and is one of the main forces of democratic politics. In addition, a resolution was passed urging the government to order the Eighteenth Group Army to return to the defense areas designated by the government. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Declaration of the Second National Political Council</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Key points of the National Political Council declaration are as follows: In the political sphere, it advocates that all citizens should be more united and support the national government and its policies of resistance and nation-building. It hopes that Communist Party members will implement the declaration of September 1937. It hopes that the government will make good use of its ruling power and protect civil rights. In the military sphere, the achievements of the anti-Japanese military in the new year prove that absolute unity of military orders and military administration is the basic condition for winning victory. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will work harder to rectify military discipline, and in accordance with the needs of the world, it must build permanent national defense. In the economic sphere, it is hoped that the government will properly use economic control policies to regulate finance, improve transportation, guide the elimination of markets, unify regulatory agencies, and seek practical results. It is hoped that the government will guide the people to practice material conservation, increase agricultural and industrial production. In the diplomatic sphere, it deeply admires the concern of friendly nations such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union for China and agrees with the government's policy, strengthening ties with friendly nations at any time to achieve mutual assistance and cooperation. It is further hoped that the government will make a clear statement that anyone who supports Japan and recognizes fake organizations should be considered a public enemy of China. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The National Political Council held full day meetings this morning and afternoon. As today was the last day for general debate and proposals at the assembly, the gallery was exceptionally crowded.

Finally, the provisional motions of Zhang Zhijiang and others were discussed, requesting the government to issue a clear order regarding the case of Niu Mingshu, the deceased county magistrate of Dengfeng County, Henan Province, who had achieved outstanding results in handling military service in Xiangyang. The assembly decided to request the government to investigate and handle the case, and to select and commend county magistrates who have performed well in military service. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

Fifteen people were elected as resident members, and no alternate members were set. The chairman of the presidium served as the chairman of the resident committee during the adjournment, and there was no need to be re-elected as a resident member. Leng Pan, Chen Jingxiu, and Xi Yiyun were designated as supervisors. Ballots were then issued for the election. After the election, the ballots were counted while the discussion was in progress. The government's discussion of the government's important domestic and foreign policies in the 30th year, the review of reports from the military, financial, economic, transportation, agricultural and forestry, education, and other departments, and proposals related to the commodity price issue were successively passed.

The meeting adjourned at 6:30 pm. (Dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Explains the Government's Attitude Towards the Chinese Communist Party</h3>
<p>Chongqing - At the sixth meeting of the Political Council, Chairman Chiang explained the government's attitude towards the issue of the Chinese Communist Party boycotting by not attending the Council meeting. His speech was as follows: Chairman, fellow councilors, today I, Zhongzheng, on behalf of the government, will explain the attitude towards the various conditions put forward by the Chinese Communist Party councilors to this Council. Before reporting, there is one point I want to make clear, that is, the government has always been reluctant to make any public report on the issue of the Chinese Communist Party. However, this time, the Communist Party councilors have formally put forward conditions to our national public opinion organ, the National Political Council, in the form of letters and telegrams, which is different from the nature of their various speeches and actions in the past. Therefore, for the sake of the country, the nation, the war, and the future of nation-building, we must make a formal statement to the National Political Council at this time. When a country is engaged in a life-and-death battle against foreign enemies, what the fate of the country and nation rests on is discipline and law. As long as discipline is not lost and the law is implemented, no matter how dangerous and difficult the situation, we can turn danger into safety and achieve the final victory. If discipline is corrupted and all military orders cannot be implemented, then even if there is a strong military force, it will inevitably lead to failure and ultimately to destruction. The military and civilians of the entire country are now using the strength of the entire nation to engage in a life-and-death struggle. At this critical moment, we must pay special attention to the country's discipline and law. What is particularly heartbreaking and infuriating is that the Chinese Communist Party members, who are also citizens of the Republic of China, have put forward two enemy-like conditions to the National Political Council, which represents the national public opinion organ, during this period when the entire nation is resisting aggression and striving for survival, namely the so-called "rehabilitation measures" and "temporary solutions", and use the non-attendance of the Political Council as a threat. The names of these conditions are already shocking. We sincerely do not know how the Chinese Communist Party, at the risk of standing in opposition to the government and the National Political Council of its own country, will explain itself to the people of the country.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has always adopted a policy of forbearance and tolerance towards the affairs of the Chinese Communist Party. As long as it does not conflict with or hinder the country's discipline and law, whether it is a political, social, or party issue, it advocates open and honest discussion to seek a reasonable solution. This kind of painstaking effort to compromise is nothing more than to consolidate the strength of unity and achieve the ultimate success of resistance and nation-building. However, since the Communist Party councilors have formally put forward conditions to the National Political Council, which is the national public opinion organ, in the form of letters and telegrams, its nature is different from their usual speeches and actions. The main purpose of this article is only to generally explain the content and significance of the Communist Party's demands and point out their errors. In summary,</p>
<p>the content of the Communist Party's demands can be roughly divided into three parts: military, political, and party affiliation. The so-called "rehabilitation measures" from the first to the eighth articles (including stopping "provocations", canceling the January 17th order, punishing "the chief culprits of the Wanmen Incident" He Yingqin, Gu Zhutong, and Shangguan Yunxiang, restoring Ye Ting's freedom to return to his post as commander, returning all the men and guns of the New Fourth Army, providing compensation to the wounded and dead soldiers of the New Fourth Army in southern Anhui, and withdrawing the "Communist suppression troops" in central China and leveling the "blockade" in the northwest) and the first article of the so-called "temporary solution" immediately ceasing the "military offensive" against the Communist Party throughout the country and the sixth to the tenth articles (maintaining the status quo of the defense areas in North China, Central China, and Northwest China, re-establishing) Group Army, sharing six armies with the Eighteenth Group Army, releasing Ye Ting to return to his military post, releasing the captured cadres in southern Anhui, providing compensation to the families of the "dead and displaced", and returning the men and guns conscripted in southern Anhui), can all be summarized in the military scope. The ninth article of the "rehabilitation measures" (releasing the arrested "patriotic political prisoners") and the twelfth article (arresting the leaders of the "pro-Japanese faction" and handing them over to the national law for trial), and the third to the fifth articles of the "temporary solution" (immediately stopping the "oppression" of the New China Daily and recognizing the</p>
<p>legal status of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area, recognizing the "anti-Japanese democratic regime" after the mouth) can all be summarized in the political scope. The remaining tenth and eleventh articles of the "rehabilitation measures" (abolishing the "one-party dictatorship" and implementing democratic politics, implementing democracy, and obeying the Prime Minister's will) and the eleventh and twelfth articles of the "temporary solution" (establishing a joint committee of various parties and having representatives of the Communist Party join the presidium of the Political Council) can be summarized in the scope of party affiliation. Based on the above content, in terms of the military part, we can see that the Communist Party's intention is that the government must not issue a clear order to punish the rebellious troops that have violated orders and resisted orders, otherwise it will punish the government's military authorities, and it must also compensate the losses of the rebellious army. In terms of the political part, they require that a special area be demarcated outside the administrative system of the National Government, that a special political system be recognized, and that the government's illegal actions against public and private groups and individuals be restricted, and that they not be banned in accordance with the law. The government must also recognize its so-called "future people's livelihood political machine," especially the following connects to the fourth page</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Prepares to Return Visits to Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>Rumors of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's impending return visits to Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union have been circulating since late February, with reports suggesting that Matsuoka would travel to Europe with the German envoy Ott. While the Japanese government has maintained a mysterious silence, Ott departed alone the day before yesterday. However, news from Berlin indicates that this has been officially confirmed through government announcements, suggesting that Matsuoka's visit to Germany is only a matter of time. This development can be seen as a new stage in the collusion between Japan and the Axis powers, and a new warning sign amid the uncertainty in the Pacific situation.</p>
<p>The already announced news is that Matsuoka plans to visit Berlin and Rome successively. The previous rumors of a trip to the Soviet Union for treaty negotiations have faded. According to a report from the International News Service, Matsuoka personally told American journalist Wiegand that this trip is to return the visits of Germany and Italy, and that discussions with Stalin are not part of the plan. If it is said that the true meaning of diplomatic rhetoric can only be discerned from the opposite perspective, then diplomacy with the Soviet Union is perhaps one of the important tasks of Matsuoka's trip. Between Japan and Germany and Italy, an alliance relationship already exists, and both sides have a desire to strengthen their collusion. What remains to be decided at this time are only some practical and technical issues. There are no major difficulties that require Matsuoka to personally intervene to overcome them. However, the lack of progress in Soviet-Japanese relations is a difficult problem that Japan is deeply concerned about on the eve of launching new adventurous actions. Therefore, even if the Japanese side is not solely relying on Matsuoka to break the deadlock in diplomacy with the Soviet Union, at the very least, in addition to returning visits to Germany and Italy, it must also have significant illusions about the Soviet Union. Moreover, the intensification of German-Japanese ties will inevitably cause serious doubts in the Soviet Union, which is situated between the two countries. Even the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact had to painstakingly include a proviso in Article 5 to avoid provoking strong resentment from the Soviet side. Therefore, during Matsuoka's visit to Germany, if he does not simultaneously engage in parallel operations with the Soviet Union, it will only serve to stimulate the Kremlin authorities and make the hope of a Soviet-Japanese treaty even more elusive. This is certainly not the original intention of the Japanese authorities at this time. It was previously reported that Matsuoka believes that if Japan can sign a satisfactory agreement with the Soviet Union, he must personally make a trip, which will definitely be related to his planned trip to Europe.</p>
<p>Matsuoka's preparation to go to Europe seems on the surface to indicate that Japan will not take immediate action in the Pacific and that its necessary preparations for southward advance have not yet been completed. However, this move itself, whether its main goal is focused on Germany or the Soviet Union, is equally a further step for Japan towards future adventurous actions. Not long ago, when Britain and the United States expressed serious concern and took precautions against the Far East crisis, the Japanese authorities tried their best to defend themselves and engaged in various tactics, such as Matsuoka's suggestion to mediate the European war, Nomura's expression of postponing the proposal to resolve the Japanese-American dispute, and Shigemitsu's repeated contacts with the British authorities, and the assurance that Japan is not prepared to attack any part of the British Empire. All of these were intended to ease the tension and trepidation of the whole world and attribute that tension to the self-disturbance of democratic countries. Some people in democratic countries also suddenly became optimistic because of these gestures from the Japanese side. This may be the reason why the Japanese authorities have remained so secretive about Matsuoka's visit to Germany. If it were not for the German side's excitement and satisfaction that led them to announce it, that optimistic atmosphere might have continued until the departure for Germany. In fact, since last winter, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly stated their willingness to adjust their diplomatic relations with the United States. However, they have never failed to clearly express that they will take the Tripartite Pact as the keynote of their foreign policy. Even in the recent stage of striving to ease relations with Britain and the United States, they have wantonly coerced French Indochina and revealed their covetousness for Oceania. It is not necessary to wait for the confirmation of the visit to Germany to confirm Japan's future direction. The cultivation of the visit to Germany into realization is no different from demonstrating Japan's determination to deeply collude with the Axis powers and prepare for new adventures, and no longer paying attention to the reactions and pressures from Britain and the United States. On the other hand, if there is still a remnant of appeasement in the international community regarding the Far East, then it should have lost its last basis for illusion at this time.</p>
<p>Speculating on Japan's intentions, it seems that on the one hand, it is using diplomatic gestures to ease the vigilance of Britain and the United States, while at the same time actively promoting its necessary facilities and preparations. For Germany, because the so-called spring offensive is about to be launched, the two sides need to have further contact. The long-unresolved relations with the Soviet Union also urgently need to be resolved. Therefore, the decision was made to plan a trip to Europe, mainly to promote the completion of these tasks in addition to courtesy visits. Between Japan and the Axis countries, the two sides are in great need, and it is not difficult to hit it off. It is believed that Matsuoka will be able to fulfill his mission of intensifying collusion. As for Soviet-Japanese relations, however, due to recent changes, the complexity of this issue has increased. Although the new situation in the Balkans and the Soviet Union's concern for its western border may strengthen its demand for peaceful coexistence with Japan, the new changes in Soviet-German relations have greatly reduced Germany's function as an intermediary. If the recent reports of the trend of Soviet-American rapprochement are not entirely fictitious, then the Soviet Union cannot but give greater consideration to diplomatic steps that could lead to a break between Japan and Britain and the United States. Therefore, although Matsuoka's trip can be seen as having lost the most favorable opportunity, whether it can achieve significant success still depends on whether democratic countries can take agile and effective countermeasures.</p>
<p>The extreme of evolution can cultivate the opportunity for external troubles to enter, and the great calamity of plotting to seize political power. In terms of party factions, they demand that only the Chinese Communist Party can have a special status and special rights in the National Political Council, while other party factions and councilors of the [unclear] faction must not enjoy equally equal treatment with the CCP, otherwise the CCP will refuse to attend. The true intentions of these two conditions are like this. If the government accepts them casually, what kind of country will China become, and what kind of public opinion organ will the National Political Council become? The consistent policy of the Chinese Nationalist Government is to nationalize the army. In other words, under the jurisdiction of the Nationalist Government, there is only one national army system, and there must not be a second private party or personal army system. I have clearly stated that the National Revolutionary Army is the army of the country, not the army of any one party, let alone regard a part of the National Revolutionary Army as the army of the Communist Party. Military orders can be</p>
<p>divided into two, then how is it different from the military organization supported by the Japanese? This is not only intolerable to the Nationalist Government, but also deeply hated by the people of the whole country. How can the Chinese Communist Party, which is loyal to the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction, bear to do this? Secondly, in the political aspect, the Nationalist Government has always taken political democratization as its goal. Under the national laws and decrees, no matter the national individuals or groups, as long as they abide by the discipline, take responsibility, [unclear] their duties, and [unclear] their benefits, everyone has their freedom. However, there cannot be two political powers within a country. If another political power is established outside the Nationalist Government, such as the so-called "post-democracy political power" in this [unclear] condition, how is such a division of national political power different from the political organization supported by the Japanese? It is not only intolerable to the government, but also hated by the people of the whole country and irreconcilable with it. Thirdly, regarding the party faction issue, although China has a ruling party and an opposition party in fact due to the [unclear] of historical evolution, and the difference in the strength and duration of each party, its spirit is</p>
<p>equal across the board.</p>
<p>Especially in the National Political Council, a public opinion organ, there is only the position of the people, not the position of the party. It must not allow any party or individual to have a special status and any right to demand in the council, so as to undermine the foundation of the democratic politics that is still in its infancy. Since the Eighteenth Group Army disobeyed the order of the Supreme Command in 1938 and withdrew to the right bank of the Yellow River without authorization, and soon illegally occupied Suide and other places, the [unclear] of the Chinese government authorities at that time did not think that this was entirely instructed by the CCP, nor did they think that the CCP intended to undermine the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction. The army's inability to absolutely respect the central military orders may not necessarily have a [unclear] plan to undermine the Anti-Japanese War and disturb the rear. However, the [unclear] impact of this army's actions has caused unrest among the people of the whole country, and has invisibly created an extremely bad influence that affects the overall situation, and even causes [unclear] entry and endangers the [unclear]. For more than two years, the Chinese government has had to make arrangements to stabilize the interior in the rear of the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction in West [unclear] and North [unclear], while leading the entire army to fight hard on the front line. This is indeed a sad war history unprecedented in the history of China and foreign countries. However, the Chinese government has led and prepared for more than two years, and finally made the front and rear safe and sound. This is the supreme [unclear] event. If it had not been prepared in time two years ago, perhaps now the Anti-Japanese War in the southwest and northwest, even if the rear does not suffer from the intrusion of the Japanese army, it will also be destroyed and shaken by traitors, and the people in the rear will not be able to get the protection of the local government and the national army, just like the people in the occupied areas of Ji, Cha, Lu, and Su now, and will suffer heavy pressure and ravage. However, in order to stabilize the rear, most of the troops that could have been sent to the front line to fight had to be left in the rear. This is indeed a great loss of China's combat power. To avoid this unnecessary loss, we can only hope that</p>
<p>the CCP side</p>
<p>will repent and change its past attitude and actions, not regard the Eighteenth Group Army as a tool for a party's private use, used to contain friendly forces and hinder the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction. In the declaration issued by the CCP in September 1937, it stated four points: (1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are the necessity of China today. This party (the Communist Party itself) is willing to strive for its thorough [unclear] [unclear]; (3) Abolish all policies and movements to overthrow the Chinese Kuomintang regime and stop the policy of confiscating landlords' land by violence; (3) Abolish the Soviet [unclear] government and implement a people's political [unclear] in order to unify the political power of Qian State; (4) Abolish the name and [unclear] number of the Red Army, and reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, under the command of the Military [unclear] Committee of the National Government. If the CCP can strictly implement these four points in the future, and make the troops related to the CCP concentrate in designated areas according to the orders and plans of the Military Affairs Commission, and be kind and sincere with the friendly troops of the whole country,</p>
<p>harmonious and cooperative,</p>
<p>and faithfully carry out the combat missions, then the armies of the whole country will be united to resist foreign insults, there will be no restraint in the rear, and there will be no worries. All the national troops will be dispatched to the front line as much as possible, and the Japanese army will be attacked fiercely. In this way, we will be able to achieve the greatest and amazing victory in a short period of time, so that the lost land will be recovered as soon as possible, and the people in the war zones will be liberated as soon as possible. This is the great contribution of the Chinese Communist Party and the Eighteenth Group Army to the country and the nation, and their patriotic spirit and achievements will be admired and immortalized by the military and civilians of the whole country. Also, what needs to be slightly corrected in the way is the so-called "stop provocation", "withdraw [unclear] the Communist troops in [unclear]", and "immediately stop the military [unclear] attack on our army" proposed by the CCP councilors. This kind of malicious propaganda that reverses black and white and confuses the public is not only slandering the government and deliberately undermining the sacred mission of the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction, but also insulting the pure spirit of national unity and [unclear] [unclear]. The Chinese [unclear] and the military and civilians all know that they are united</p>
<p>to resist foreign insults</p>
<p>and will never bear to see the so-called military affairs of "[unclear] Communism" again, let alone have such ominous terms in Chinese history again. The Chinese government loves and protects the loyal soldiers and generals, and there is no reason to so-called provoke or attack and commit suicide. Even if any army has made mistakes in the past, as long as it can regret its past mistakes and abide by the law from now on, the government will be generous and will not blame the past. However, if there is any act of disobeying orders, disrupting discipline, and undermining the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction, such as what the New Fourth Army did before, for the sake of national interests and the future of the Anti-Japanese War, no matter which army it is, it must be punished according to law. I have guaranteed to the National Political Council that there will be no more military affairs of "moving Communism" in the future, and I also ask all councilors present to sincerely unite and work together to resist foreign insults, and earnestly encourage the CCP councilors, hoping that they can reverse their past attitude, attend the meeting, and discuss the issues they want to raise in the long term, and allow all resolutions and regulations made by the Council to resolve this incident on how the government should deal with it, the government will not hesitate to</p>
<p>accept all of them</p>
<p>and thoroughly implement them. In short, the government is willing to listen to all problems regarding this incident as long as it can achieve the goal of unity and fighting to the end. Our National Political Council supplements it based on public opinion. As for the CCP councilors, it is hoped that they can take advantage of this time when the country is in serious distress, and in the spirit of "brothers [unclear] outside [unclear] its insults", resolutely accept the meaning of our [unclear] council and the public, try their best to unite, and face the difficulties together, so that the spirit of our national unity and war can be persisted through without any regrets. We must urge them to consistently unite to the end in order to accomplish the mission of the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction for the sake of loving the Chinese Communist Party and fulfilling their historical victory in this joint battle. This is what I, brother, want to earnestly declare to the assembly on behalf of the government today, and I hope that the councilors will sincerely understand and learn from it, and it is extremely fortunate.

<h3>Kuang Bingshun Meets Chairman Lin</h3>
<p>Chongqing American overseas Chinese leader Kuang Bingshun met with Chairman Lin of the National Government on the morning of the 10th on behalf of the overseas Chinese in the United States, led by Wu Tiecheng, Minister of the Overseas Department, and presented a gold medal engraved with the words "Presented to Chairman Lin of the National Government," which was quite exquisite. Chairman Lin personally accepted it and inquired in detail about the recent situation of overseas [unclear] compatriots, showing the chairman's deep concern for overseas Chinese. (10th telegram)</p>

<h3>Madame Chiang's Speech on "March 8th" Encouraging Women's Circles</h3>
<p>Chongqing Madame Chiang delivered a speech at the "March 8th" Women's Day commemorative meeting today. The original text reads: Today we celebrate International Women's Day, and this is the fourth time since July 7th. We women in China are more familiar with wartime situations than the people in Europe, because in Europe, celebrating Women's Day in the midst of war is only the second time. From the standpoint of Chinese women, we say that today's Women's Day is more important than in the past. We Chinese people call this "March 8th" commemorative day International Women's Day. The so-called "festival" contains the meaning of commemoration, celebration, and encouragement. Today's international phenomena make us Chinese women feel very different from the past twelve months. The international scene two years ago was depressing and even dark. The scene a year ago was precarious. Today, we face the light and have new hope. Today, this international festival is only truly celebrated with us by democratic countries, because all democratic countries have understood what the ultimate goal of the world war against aggression is. These countries now unanimously recognize that whenever and wherever the freedom and democracy of a country is violated, the people of every other democratic country should consider this threat as being linked to the foundation of their survival. The aggressor's attack on one place is just a trick by the aggressor. It wants to slowly swallow the whole world bit by bit. Now they have encountered the unity and strong resistance of the democratic countries of the world, which they never dreamed of.</p>
<p>China has been appealing to the world for four years. We ask friendly countries to recognize the importance of democratic unity, which is more urgent than asking others for help. Democratic countries should concentrate their human and material resources to cope with this common scourge of mankind. The people of the world previously turned a deaf ear to this appeal, but now they have paid attention to it because they have tasted the experience. They understand that the aggressive group is preparing to divide the world [unclear]. People also understand that if they want to defeat this aggressive group, the unity of the [unclear] is the most important thing. In order to make this unity strong and powerful, disregarding the self-interest of a country should be regarded as an outdated narrow-mindedness. Although the democratic countries have not yet fully realized this ideal, they have at least been able to express sympathy for China's arduous struggle and recognize China as their pioneer. Our Chinese compatriots today are happy and encouraged by this national phenomenon, regardless of men and women. In particular, the women's community has received news from overseas, knowing that the women of the world's democratic countries are wholeheartedly expressing sympathy for China's Anti-Japanese War and understanding the importance of China's struggle in the Anti-Japanese War. In particular, American women have established a Committee to Aid Chinese Women, with the participation of most of the most [unclear] women in the United States. Under the leadership of Mrs. Roosevelt, with a sincere [unclear] and loving [unclear], they express their admiration and deep friendship to Chinese women, indicating that they are standing with us in the same position and unanimously supporting our position. The help they have given us and are preparing to give us is all to help in this spirit of shared adversity, not just the feelings of outsiders watching. In addition, they also have children's movements to help us relieve the difficulties of the party.</p>
<p>Now that the National Political Council is meeting in the wartime capital, the number of female councilors has increased to sixteen, and one of them is participating in the presidium. Compared with the number of female representatives in the [unclear] of various countries in the world, we have occupied a majority, which shows that Chinese women have gained a [unclear] position in the country. On the other hand, Japanese women have no place in public [unclear] careers, and the countries that are fully fighting the war do not allow their women to have reasonable freedom or allow them to express their intellectual abilities. In contrast, this is another very noteworthy thing. In the past, many women in democratic countries often waged meaningless struggles with men, only knowing how to protest and ignoring their actual ability to express themselves in many national lives. Chinese women also make the same mistake, often arguing for the right to participate in a certain occupation.</p>
<p>I believe that after the war is over, Chinese women will be able to fully obtain equal status with men, because our women have shown their ability and made considerable contributions to the country during the war. I think now is not the time to leisurely discuss theories, but to unite to actually show that our women's abilities and contributions are no less than men's. Now economic warfare is more important than military affairs. The contribution of our Chinese women compatriots to the war must also be improved. In the past, we focused on rescuing wounded soldiers, comforting the army, and relieving the difficulties of the [unclear]. This is certainly valuable, but I think we should develop more towards productivity, allowing for agricultural production. In terms of women's nature, this kind of work is very suitable, because persuasion and persuasion are more patient and responsive in women than in men. Women are housewives in the family, and because they are responsible for managing the family's economy, they have more experience in the meaning and method of "diligence and thrift". At this time of expensive white goods, the care taken by housewives in food selection can be said to be the most valuable contribution of the [unclear] nation, and should not be regarded as a trivial daily matter.</p>
<p>Our Chinese compatriots have always had the ability to "make the most of waste." Nutrition expert Dr. Shen Ben once said, "Cattle feed is also edible by humans." It is a pity to casually discard grass and feed. If it can be well prepared, it can be made into the best food and served at the most noble banquet. Therefore, housewives should painstakingly think about how to maintain the general life in the selection and use of items, which is as valuable as scientists inventing fuels and other necessities as substitutes. The low status of women in old China may be somewhat exaggerated. In fact, there have been many great women in Chinese history. However, we hope that the increase in the status of women in China will not only be the same as that of women in other democratic countries, but also surpass them. We should start from today and make up our minds to show that we have the same ability as men to transfer the country's work, and prove that we have the ability and ambition to exercise our rights to save the country.

<h3>America to Establish Supreme Body, Maximally Aiding Democratic Nations; Detailed Aid to China Plan Pending Decision</h3>
<p>Washington - Congressional circles yesterday, after the Senate passed the Lend-Lease Act, stated that President Roosevelt will establish a supreme body to assist in matters concerning aid to China, Britain, Greece, U.S. defense needs, and foreign policy. They said that this special agency of the President's will manage the key work of defense production, the Defense Commission, and the Production Management Office, primarily focusing on increasing the design and rate of production. They also stated that, in order to maximally aid democratic nations while not neglecting the international situation and domestic foreign policy planning, the establishment of a new agency under the President's command is truly necessary. Well-informed sources predict that Harry Hopkins, Roosevelt's special envoy previously sent to London, will be the central figure in this new agency. Other personnel will include the Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of the Navy, and Secretary of War. Secretary of State Hull will represent foreign policy, Secretary of the Navy Knox and Secretary of War Stimson will represent naval and army military strategy, while Hopkins will represent the social standpoint and, through his insights gained in Britain, study Britain's urgent needs. President Roosevelt and other government spokespersons are refusing to release detailed information before the bill is signed into effect. The new agency will decide what to supply to which country and under what conditions. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - Government officials yesterday declined to release the extent to which the U.S. government intends to aid China. However, Far East experts believe that the Congressional approval of the Lend-Lease Act is tantamount to aiding China as it would Britain. Most well-informed sources believe that the government will await Dr. Currie's return before deciding on the detailed content of aid to China. Some well-informed sources say that Dr. Currie may be one of the members of the privy council or supreme body that will determine the scope and method of procedures for aiding democratic countries. This procedure will include attempts to break the Japanese blockade (because the Sino-Japanese war is unsuitable for battle), or whether to increase transportation via the Burma Road into China. A decision is still pending. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt's defense advisors today have accelerated preparations to make the United States the arsenal of democracy. The main questions are: (1) Where should we go? (2) Is our aim to make America both the food supplier and arsenal for democratic countries? (3) What equipment and how much equipment should be leased to Britain, Greece, and China? Two months after the Lend-Lease Act's procedure has been transferred from Congress to the executive branch, the first step will be to send existing sea and land army equipment, those that can be easily removed or replaced, to Britain. This equipment includes naval auxiliary ships, new-style small torpedo boats, submarines, destroyers, tanks, artillery, ammunition, and airplanes. Some sources predict that the 45 destroyers currently listed as special and not counted in the Navy's combat strength figures may also be among the equipment sent to Britain early on. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Aid-to-Britain Three-Year Program Being Drafted by U.S.</p>
<p>Washington - The Lend-Lease Act can become law no later than Wednesday of this week. The House is likely to accept all Senate amendments on Tuesday, and then the bill will be sent to the White House for the President's signature. There is currently a rumor here that a three-year, $1 million aid-to-Britain program is being drafted. This is the first effect of the Senate's passage of the Lend-Lease Act. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - Government authorities predict that an agency will be established immediately to speed up the transport of ships, airplanes, and munitions to China, Britain, and Greece. The Senate's passage of the Lend-Lease Act by a two-to-one majority has been interpreted as granting the government great authority to boldly move forward, arrange plans for industrial and agricultural production, and seek funding to meet the needs of democratic countries struggling in war. All sides agree that Britain's urgent needs will take first priority in American supplies, followed by China and Greece. The government is being quite secretive about the details of implementing the Lend-Lease Act. According to Senate Majority Leader Barkley, the next step will definitely be to acquire defense materials through appropriations to be delivered to Britain. Some sources predict that the President's first request will be for $10 billion to $30 billion. At the same time, in accordance with the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act, Britain will first be supplied from existing U.S. military supplies. There are only two restrictions regarding this matter. First, the President must first consult with the General Staff and the Naval General Staff. Second, the total value of these materials must not exceed $13 billion. Beyond this, no further Congressional approval is required. Well-informed sources say that Britain's most pressing needs now are ships, destroyers, artillery, and food. As for the airplane issue, the United States is already helping Britain to the extent that it can urgently manufacture them. It is unlikely, however, that Britain can be supplied with a large number immediately because it would hinder the United States' Far East policy. The U.S. must maintain superior air power in the Pacific. However, the government can appropriately allocate airplanes and transport vehicles to the U.S. within the scope of $13 billion from existing inventory. These sources believe that no one will oppose the United States allocating all possible merchant ships to Britain, and perhaps continuing to provide Britain with some destroyers.

<h3>Harriman Departs for Britain to Investigate Munitions and Food</h3>
<p>New York - Averell Harriman, President of the American Pacific Railroad Company, left for London today on the orders of President Roosevelt. Before his departure, he told reporters that Roosevelt not only ordered him to examine the American munitions that had already been sent to Britain, but also ordered him to investigate Britain's food situation. From this, it can be seen that the U.S. government intends to supply Britain with large quantities of food. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>New York - U.S. Ambassador to the Belgian government in London, and Minister to the Norwegian and Swiss governments, Mr. Biddle, is scheduled to travel with Mr. Harriman today to take up his post. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>South African Prime Minister Returns to Post</h3>
<p>Pretoria - South African Prime Minister General Smuts returned here today by plane from Cairo. It is said that he met with British Foreign Secretary Eden and Army Chief of Staff General Dill in the Egyptian capital, and also visited East Africa and British Kenya for inspection, which was very satisfactory. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Situation Developing in the Balkans; Rumor that Hungary Will Imminently Attack Greece; One Account Awaits Diplomatic Developments</h3>
<p>London - A neutral country's news, relayed by Turkish radio last night, stated that, as the afternoon observer predicted, Germany is certain to attack Macedonia and Western Thrace (both in Greece) within 48 hours. At the same time, some also believe that Germany may await the development of its diplomatic offensive. Greece has now evacuated the residents of Thrace and deployed defenses west of Salonika. It is generally speculated that Germany will use air raids on Salonika as the preliminary stage of the attack. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Turkey is on the verge of war because German troops are gathering on the Thracian border and German bombers are also stationed on Rhodes. Turkey is calmly continuing its wartime preparations, but is cautiously preventing anti-Nazi actions. Well-informed diplomatic circles say that Turkey's policy is not due to the weakening of the alliance with Britain, but because Turkey and Britain have agreed to do their utmost to avoid Turkey being drawn into the war for the sake of both countries' interests. Even if German troops plunder Greece, this policy will continue. It is heard that Prime Minister Saydam will give a public speech in Parliament on Wednesday, while Foreign Minister Saracoğlu will give a secret speech at the "People's Party" meeting on Thursday. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - The Turkish newspaper "Saba," which published an article insulting Germany a few days ago, has now been ordered by the Turkish authorities to cease publication indefinitely. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Sofia - There is much confusing news in Bulgaria, with rumors flying. It is said that Greece has decided to completely withdraw from the Thracian province. Diplomats from neutral countries believe that Greek troops will retreat to the area west of the Struma River. Observers believe that Greek troops will defend the mountains east of Salonika. Fortresses have already been set up in that area and in the pass of Dorida (the border between Greece and Yugoslavia) over the past month. Diplomatic circles also believe that battles there could occur within days. Although Greek diplomats say that Greek troops are determined to resist foreign enemies, military experts all say that this is tantamount to suicide. Others believe that German troops are not in a hurry to capture Thrace because they are giving Greece a chance to withdraw. Well-informed sources say that King George II of Greece will soon cede the throne to Prince Paul or his younger brother. The new king will replace the current Greek Prime Minister Koryzis with the current mayor of Athens. This can eliminate British influence in the Balkans. It is heard that Germany will allow Greece to take compensation elsewhere because Greece has granted a seaport to Bulgaria. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>London - According to the official news agency of South (Yugoslavia), British Minister to Bulgaria Rendel will fly from Sofia to Istanbul today with embassy staff in a specially arranged plane. The diplomatic representatives of Poland, Belgium, and the Netherlands stationed in Bulgaria, as well as most British, Polish, Belgian, and Dutch nationals, left Bulgaria yesterday. Blackout measures in Sofia are now ready, and will be implemented on Sunday after British Minister Rendel leaves. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Sofia - After the Balkan situation cleared up, several levels of Bulgarian reservists have now been demobilized. Yesterday's official gazette declared that if the situation becomes serious, the demobilized reservists will be replaced by other reserves. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>German-Yugoslav Non-Aggression Pact to be Signed</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital - It is heard that the non-aggression pact between Yugoslavia and Germany will be signed tomorrow. Its nature will be very similar to the "permanent friendship" treaty recently concluded between Italy and Hungary, and will not contain any concrete obligations. At the same time, according to as-yet unconfirmed news, two regiments of Bulgarian cavalry have crossed into Yugoslav territory and been detained. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital - Various newspapers here recently carried a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in the Yugoslav capital saying that the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister are about to go to Berchtesgaden to hold talks with German authorities in order to jointly issue a friendly declaration, including a statement that key Yugoslav figures are scheduled to depart tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Railways Restore Transportation</h3>
<p>Budapest - A Belgrade dispatch says that the General Office of the Yugoslav Railways has announced that all lines of transportation, as well as passenger transportation, will be restored this week, and the restriction order of February 1 will be lifted. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>British and Spanish Sign Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Madrid - Spanish Minister of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Carceller, recently signed a trade agreement with British Ambassador to Spain, Sir Hoare. According to this agreement, Spain will transport 12,000 bottles of mercury and 800,000 boxes of cork to Britain in exchange for wheat and rubber produced in various territories of the British Empire. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>German and Bulgarian Troops Hold Joint Review</h3>
<p>Sofia - German and Bulgarian troops held a joint review in the towns of Plovdiv and Sliven in Bulgaria. Before the parade, generals from both countries laid wreaths at the monument to fallen Bulgarian soldiers. The German general delivered a short speech during the parade, during which the national anthems of both countries were played. The public enthusiastically cheered as the troops passed through the streets. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Axis Powers to Hold Conference in Germany; American Newspapers Pay Attention to Matsuoka's Visit to Germany</h3>
<p>Washington - American newspapers are paying considerable attention to the news that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will visit Berlin in the near future and are making many speculations. At the same time, they are publishing news of the Axis powers holding a conference in Germany in a prominent position. In an editorial, the New York Herald Tribune expressed its belief that the superficial purpose of Matsuoka's visit to Berlin is to discuss the issue of Axis cooperation, but in fact it is to inspect how many chances Germany has of winning so that Japan can decide whether to risk a war with the United States and launch an invasion of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. Matsuoka may also hope to learn what attitude the Soviet Union will take if Japan and Germany launch an invasion at the same time. However, the newspaper believes that Matsuoka will not be able to learn much about the plans of the Moscow government. The newspaper predicts that no serious incidents will occur before Matsuoka returns to Japan, and because of Germany's decision to rely on Japan's relationship, if Matsuoka is full of challenging implications when he returns to Japan, then the United States has sufficient reason to prepare for involvement in the war. The New York Times said that Matsuoka's trip to Moscow and Berlin is truly of great significance. His purpose is to obtain a guarantee from the Soviet Union, through Germany, that the Soviet Union will not interfere with Japan's southward advance. Japan and Germany may discuss the issue of the United States, and Hitler may talk a lot about his spring offensive against Britain and ask Japan to take the opportunity to launch a southward advance. However, Matsuoka will only be able to decide on this based on the attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union. The newspaper believes that since the Soviet Union is aiding China in the war against Japan, if the disputes stirred up by Japan are more numerous and further away from the Soviet Union, then the amount of Soviet aid to China will increase.

<h3>U.S. to Double Mechanized Troops; War Department Has Drafted Plan</h3>
<p>Washington - The U.S. War Department plans to double the number of active-duty officers and soldiers in the motorized forces. However, before it can be implemented, a bill must first be passed by the Senate and House of Representatives authorizing the Army authorities to retain a portion of the new recruits who have completed one year of training under the conscription law so that they can be assigned to the motorized forces for continued service. At this time, the U.S. Army only has two motorized divisions, and two more are being formed. If the plan proposed by the War Department can be implemented, there will be six motorized divisions this fall, each with 11,000 soldiers. Their organization and equipment are roughly the same as those of the German mechanized forces that fought in France last year. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Vichy's Final Instructions Delivered to Japanese Foreign Minister; Peace Treaty to be Signed Within Days</h3>
<p>Tokyo - It was learned here last night that the Thai-Vietnamese peace treaty may be signed today. Thai chief delegate Van La Weng visited Foreign Minister Matsuoka's private residence yesterday to inform him that Thailand had accepted Japan's mediation proposals. As for the French side, they will notify the Japanese authorities this morning that they have accepted the Japanese proposals. French Ambassador Henri has arranged with Matsuoka to visit him this morning. As soon as Matsuoka and Henri meet, a conference of Japanese, Thai, and Vietnamese representatives will be held, and the peace treaty is expected to be signed after the meeting. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Official sources here announced yesterday that the full text of the Thai-Vietnamese peace treaty should be published with caution. Because this Thai-Vietnamese peace negotiation was initiated by the Japanese government, the publication of the full text should also be done by the Japanese government. Regarding the content of the treaty, it is only known here that most of the land in Cambodia will be ceded to Thailand. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - After modifying the content of the peace agreement proposed by the Japanese side, the French, Thai, and Japanese sides can sign the treaty at Matsuoka's official residence at 4:00 p.m. tomorrow. (Note that French Ambassador Henri met with Matsuoka for 90 minutes today and proposed to modify the wording of the content of the peace agreement.) Japanese diplomatic circles believe that as a result of the conclusion of this agreement, the treaty concluded in 1904 to amend the 1893 treaty, the treaty of 1907, the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation of 1925, the treaty of 1926, and the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation of 1937 will all need to be amended. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - French Ambassador to Japan Henri visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka today to deliver Vichy's final instructions. The Tokyo peace talks have the appearance of coming to an end. Well-informed sources believe that the tentative or formal signing of the Thai-Vietnamese peace conditions will probably be held tonight or tomorrow. The French ambassador's visit to Matsuoka was in accordance with Vichy's instructions, in response to the French ambassador's request for final instructions last Friday. It is understood that the outline of the peace conditions will be published here immediately after the signing, and the French, Japanese, and Thai sides will also issue a joint statement describing the course of the negotiations. Matsuoka will also issue a final statement. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - Regarding the negotiations conducted by French and Thai representatives in Tokyo, the tone of Japanese newspapers towards Vietnam has softened, but there is still no indication here that would make the world believe that this negotiation has made concrete progress. In short, Japanese newspapers are optimistic about the Tokyo negotiations, but the authorities here do not know the reasons for the stagnation of the negotiations. The only thing worth mentioning is that since the tone of Japanese newspapers has softened, the world's doubts about Japan's compromising attitude can be dispelled. The difficulty of the Tokyo negotiations is probably due to Thailand's firm position. At the beginning of the Tokyo negotiations, Thailand expected that this negotiation would achieve great success. Without waiting for the completion of the negotiations, it encouraged the Thai people to march and celebrate, and hung the national flags of Thailand and Japan in the capital. All of this has only made Japan's mediation of the disputes between France and Thailand more difficult. The reason why Thailand adopted this attitude is probably due to internal reasons. It is widely rumored that if Thailand can obtain territory from Vietnam, it will allow Japan to use some bases and provide various military conveniences. This statement has been officially denied by the Thai government, and it has been confirmed in Tokyo that it is inaccurate. (Havas dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Hanoi - The General Headquarters of Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux issued a communiqué saying that the Tokyo talks have not made much progress. However, Japanese newspapers continue to guarantee that a compromise has been reached on the main points, and only minor matters remain to be resolved. In fact, after several twists and turns, the path we are now taking seems to be a forced arbitration rather than a fair mediation. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The parliament, which adjourned on March 1, will reconvene on the 15th to hold a secret meeting to hear the government's report on the details of the mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute.

<p>London - Although the communiqué issued by Hanoi stated that the Tokyo talks had not made much progress, Japanese news from Tokyo this afternoon said that an agreement to resolve the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute will be signed in Tokyo on Tuesday afternoon with the first letters. It was expected that the agreement would be signed yesterday, but according to a Tokyo telegram last night, it was announced that it would be postponed until the last moment.

<h3>Hoover Relief Plan Opposed by Britain, Claiming It Will Aid the Enemy and Delay British Victory</h3>
<p>New York - Former U.S. President Hoover's plan to set up public soup kitchens in Belgium has now been rejected by Britain. The British Embassy in the United States issued an article stating that the British government believes that relief work in enemy-occupied areas, regardless of its conditions, will ultimately delay the date of victory. Therefore, the British government must reiterate its determination not to allow external aid to be transported into any area occupied by the enemy, so as not to weaken or destroy the blockade line. The British Embassy's communiqué also pointed to the suggestion of transporting materials into Belgium to relieve the poor as a false humanitarian act. Hoover subsequently published a reply, saying that while he expressed sympathy for Britain's war claims, the food problem in the occupied areas was actually far more serious than the British communiqué stated. He believes that preserving the lives of countless children is not a false humanitarian act. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Goebbels Promotes that the War Will End This Year; Germany Will Launch a Surprise Attack on Britain When the Climate Is Fully Suitable</h3>
<p>Madrid - Spanish Sunday newspapers all carried the news of the U.S. Senate's passage of the Lend-Lease Act with large headlines. Spanish people are now watching with some interest whether the German saying that American aid is too late is true. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently reiterated this statement to interviewers from Spain and other countries, saying that he can reaffirm that Germany will end the war this year. When the climate is fully suitable, Germany will launch an irresistible attack on Britain. The Spanish ABC newspaper published this statement, which occupied a more prominent position than the news of the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. However, the newspaper then disclosed in large letters elsewhere an article that described the terrible situation of British defenses, seemingly inadvertently giving Goebbels a reply. The article also said that there is a large German army stationed in northern France, which is now practicing jumping off boats and swimming with thousands of lifebuoys every day.

<h3>Situation in Africa</h3>
<p>London - According to recent reports from Africa, Italian troops in Abyssinia are still being pursued by Allied forces from the southeast and northeast. Meanwhile, British Empire troops who invaded Abyssinia from Italian Somaliland have now penetrated 150 miles into the Abyssinian front. At the same time, patriotic Abyssinian forces continue to advance south of Lake Tana, forcing the retreating Italian troops inland. A high command communiqué issued in Cairo announced that British forces advancing from Italian Somaliland had occupied the Italian military outpost of Taibraidari. There is a road from Taibraidari to the city of Harar, 240 miles away, which is located on the main road east of Addis Ababa and is also traversed by the Djibouti railway, making it a strategically important location. North Africa has been relatively quiet recently, but British aircraft in North Africa continue to bomb the port of Tripoli, railway lines, and airfields in Tripolitania.

<h3>Vietnamese Funds in the US Frozen</h3>
<p>Washington - Rumors have circulated that the United States has already frozen funds belonging to French Vietnam held in the United States. Financial circles here have recently commented on this matter, stating that after the armistice agreement between France and Germany was signed in June last year, the US Treasury Department issued an order freezing Vietnamese funds in the United States. However, within a few weeks, the Treasury Department specifically authorized the Banque de l'Indochine to use a portion of its deposits. There has been no change in this decision.

<h3>Soviet Red Star Newspaper Reviews British and German Strategies: Praises the Increased Strength of the United States, Germany Finds It Difficult to Invade the Three Islands</h3>
<p>New York - A recent military commentary in the Soviet Army newspaper Red Star vigorously asserted that Britain's strength has greatly increased since June of last year, while the difficulties facing the Axis powers are increasing daily. This commentary is particularly important, as Stalin's policy in dealing with the current international situation is adapted to military circumstances, and Red Star's views naturally have some influence on it. The commentaries made by the newspaper since the outbreak of the war have all been absolutely accurate and in line with the opinions of the Soviet high command. When assessing the activities of the warring European nations, it is never influenced by international political conditions. Therefore, when Red Star declares that Germany's military apparatus is not sufficient to overcome the sea barrier of the British Isles, and that a vast military force is needed to invade, this view can be regarded as a reflection of Stalin's personal views. Its true meaning is that the Soviet Union does not believe that Hitler can subdue Britain with an offensive strategy. Furthermore, Red Star highly praises the skill of the British generals in adapting to new tactics in the North African campaign. This indicates that most foreign observers are amazed by the boldness of British strategy, as they believe that the North African offensive that began in Sidi Barrani was not of great importance. Red Star's assessment is that although German air power may be able to harass British control of the Mediterranean, it can never overcome it. This argument also praises Britain's ability to adapt to new problems. This view has been demonstrated by Germany's reduction of air raids on the Mediterranean, probably due to heavy losses and British bombing of new German bases in Sicily. Red Star's opinion is that one-third of the Italian army is unable to be mobilized due to its involvement in the Greek campaign, which shows that the Soviet Union understands the extreme importance of the Albanian campaign to the fascists. Red Star further stated that although Italy's combat strength is so great, Greece is still able to control the situation, forcing the Italian army to retreat to the coast. This statement is the Soviet Union's opinion of Italy's combat capabilities. Neither Italy nor Germany can feel satisfied with this recent Soviet military commentary. When Moscow holds its current views, it is difficult for the dictators of the Axis powers to influence Stalin in any way. The Soviet Union cannot remain silent forever about Germany's control of Romania and Bulgaria. Stalin must wait for an opportunity to contain the Axis in the southeast. He now clearly sees that Britain is not only able to take care of itself but also that Romania is in turmoil. Stalin certainly does not want to challenge Germany in a belligerent manner, but when Hitler's difficulties increase, Stalin can secretly increase his pressure, as he is doing now.

<h3>Chinese Forces in Western Guangdong Advance to the Outskirts of Taishan, Recovering the Three Strongholds of Gongyi Port, etc. Chinese Forces Successfully Attack in the Yichang Area</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Military news: (1) After Chinese forces entered Sanbu on the 6th, they continued to attack Danshuikou, Gongyi Port, and Dajiangxu, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese until the evening of the 7th. The Japanese, unable to withstand the attacks, retreated in disarray towards Xinhui and Taishan along the original route. Chinese forces completely recovered these three strongholds and continued to pursue the defeated Japanese forces. On the 8th, one Chinese column crossed Shachong Chenyong and was fiercely attacking Dazexu, while another column crossed Shuibu and approached the outskirts of Taishan. (2) On the opposite bank of Guanchang, Japanese forces invading from the west entered Wangshizi Chong on the afternoon of the 8th and continued to attack Sifangwan. One column advanced through Daqiaobian towards Tiantaiguan, and another column attacked Xinqiaoba through Xianglingkou. After being severely attacked by Chinese forces, the Japanese momentum was halted. Chinese forces took advantage of the situation to counterattack the Japanese on several routes. By the morning of the 8th, one column had attacked Tianlongxiang, another column had completely occupied the mountainous area north of Daqiaobian, and another column had killed more than 500 Japanese troops between Baimaxi and Daqiaobian and was currently fiercely attacking Xianglingkou Daqiaobian and encircling a portion of the Japanese troops near Daqiaobian, engaging in a fierce annihilation.

<p>Chongqing - A military spokesman commented on the retreat of Japanese troops from various locations in southern Guangdong, stating that this is another clear indication of the failure of the Japanese attempt to blockade China.

<h3>Chongqing's Air Defenses on High Alert</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Since news came that a large number of Japanese planes had arrived in Wuhan, and after Japanese planes reconnoitered Chongqing, air defense precautions have been intensified. According to unconfirmed reports, Japanese planes have recently flown from bases in southern China to Hankou, preparing for a large-scale air raid on Chongqing. Since Japanese planes have been reconnoitering Chongqing recently, this belief seems quite reasonable. Around noon on Saturday and Sunday last week, four Japanese planes circled over the city to take photographs. (March 10th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Two-Week Anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization</h3>
<p>Chongqing - March 12th is the second anniversary of the promulgation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline.

<h3>International Anecdotes (9): The United States Prepares to Freeze Foreign Capital</h3>
<p>The following is a translation of a report from the New York Times:</p>
<p>The United States Treasury Department is now planning to take further steps to "freeze" all foreign capital in the United States, based on restrictions on the withdrawal of funds in the United States belonging to countries that have been invaded. It has been working with the Federal Reserve Banks in New York and Washington to draft an order that can be implemented as soon as President Roosevelt signs it. The purpose of this move is to prevent funds from Germany, Japan, and other Axis countries from flowing out of and into the United States. Funds from Germany and Switzerland have been flowing out of the United States in a steady stream recently, precisely to prevent this kind of measure.</p>
<p>There are no separate, precise statistics on how much money Canada, the Soviet Union, Switzerland, Latin America, the Far East, and European countries have on deposit in the United States. The Federal Reserve Bank made an estimate in August 1939, one month before the outbreak of the current European war. It is said that all countries have a total of $8,400,000,000 in gold, dollar deposits, and direct and indirect investments in the United States. Of this amount, Canada accounts for $1,070,000,000, Switzerland accounts for $1,250,000,000, the Soviet Union accounts for $1,000,000,000, other European countries account for $2,750,000,000, Latin American countries account for $1,090,000,000, and Far Eastern countries account for $1,110,000,000. Although Germany accounts for only $160,000,000, there may be German deposits included in the deposits of Switzerland and other neutral countries.</p>
<p>As of January 15 of this year, deposits held by foreign governments and foreign banks in the twelve branches of the US Federal Reserve Bank, including the deposits of invaded countries that have already been "frozen," totaled $1,229,812,600. Of this amount, deposits held by foreign banks in the branches of the Federal Reserve Bank totaled $664,000,000, with $600,000,000 held in New York. However, the large amounts of dollars deposited by foreign businesses and individuals in those banks and in commercial banks in New York are not included in these figures.</p>
<p>As for the gold held by various countries in the United States, it is worth $1,800,000,000, most of which has been ordered by the government to be "frozen." The gold held by the United Kingdom in the United States is worth only $205,000,000.</p>
<p>The US government's original restrictions on withdrawals only applied to countries that had been occupied in whole or in part by Germany or the Soviet Union, to prevent the invading countries from taking possession of the deposits of the occupied countries. However, Germany, Italy, Japan, and other countries were still able to use various methods to transfer deposits, and people from neutral countries could also withdraw funds on behalf of the Axis countries. After the new order is implemented, the funds held by all countries in the United States will be subject to the same restrictions as the funds of Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania. The scope of the "freeze" includes (1) foreign exchange transactions, (2) transfer of deposits, (3) payment, export, and withdrawal of gold, silver, and currency, and (4) transfer, withdrawal, and export of various assets.</p>
<p>As for governments of countries that the United States sympathizes with, it can provide as much accommodation as possible, but applications from neutral countries can be carefully reviewed to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>The Authorities Feel Their Responsibility and Are Planning to Cope with the Food Crisis. So-Called Severe Measures Are Being Discussed. Hopefully, They Will Be Implemented Soon to Save the People from Their Plight.</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that prices in this city are rising daily, which greatly affects the livelihoods of the citizens, the authorities of the two concessions are conducting a careful study of the prices of various items in order to curb them. Once the study is completed, it will be officially announced. In order to ensure smooth progress, the authorities of the two concessions will exchange opinions at any time. In yesterday's meeting of the Price Equalization Committee of the French Concession Public Works Bureau, the prices of rice, coal, and daily necessities within the concession were studied one by one for reference in suppressing and stabilizing prices.</p>
<p>Emergency Measures to Deal with the Current Rice Situation</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports: It was learned today (March 10) that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Public Works Bureau may soon take severe new measures to deal with the critical rice situation. According to Deputy Director Ho of the Municipal Council, the Council and the Public Works Bureau will hold a meeting soon, after which the details of the measures to be taken will be announced. The Board of Directors will discuss the suggestions made by the Shanghai Rice and Bean Trade Association after its meeting last Friday. It is reported that the transaction of rice on the market, in addition to the officially set price limit, with the addition of a premium, has now become an open secret. However, the Municipal Council has ordered detectives from the Police Department stationed in the rice market to monitor all official transactions in the rice market. It is also heard that a large amount of government rice, sufficient for the city's consumption for one month, will arrive in Shanghai within the next five weeks, and that the current rice stocks in Shanghai's warehouses are sufficient to meet the city's needs.</p>
<p>The Premium on Rice Has Not Yet Been Banned</p>
<p>Yesterday, the highest premium on foreign rice once reached more than 2,500 yuan, which exceeded the price limit by 25 yuan per bag, causing public panic to reach an extremely serious stage. Public opinion was in an uproar, and unanimously advocated a large-scale thorough investigation of rice stocks in warehouses. It has now been confirmed that the total amount of foreign rice that can be shipped to Shanghai this week will reach more than 100,000 bags. These foreign rice bags are all already on their way to Shanghai. Speculators in the rice market, hearing this news, were bewildered and at a loss, fearing unnecessary losses, so they rushed to sell their hoarded goods. In the afternoon, the spot supply in the rice market suddenly increased, and morale weakened. However, rice merchants were not interested in buying, as they thought that the price of rice would fall. The outlet for the spot market was not as smooth as before. As a result, the "secret premium" for small-grained rice fell to 2,000 yuan per 100 bags, a price drop of about 3 yuan per bag. However, this is still far from the original price limit. According to rice industry sources, the price of rice in Hunan is 10 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), and the price of foreign rice produced in Nanyang (Southeast Asia) has also tended to fall. Although transportation costs have increased, they are still limited.</p>
<p>Difficult to Reduce the Public Storage Contribution</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Association issued a public notice to the market to urge its members to pay their contribution to the public warehouse within a time limit, saying, "All firms that have not paid must submit the full amount of the assigned quota to the designated bank before March 11. All the quotas assigned to each firm were repeatedly urged by the Municipal Council and have already been sent to the Council for submission. Currently, it is difficult to approve any applications for reduction. It is hoped that everyone will try their best to undertake the obligation and promptly pay within the time limit. If payment is still not made after the deadline, we will be unable to help. We will have to notify the rice market and the miscellaneous grain market to suspend their right to enter the market to buy and sell and will no longer make any concessions. This matter concerns the food supply of all citizens, the reputation of the industry, and your own interests. Please abide by these rules. This is extremely important. This notice."</p>
<p>600,000 Bags of Rice to Arrive This Month</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, almost every ship arriving in Shanghai since the 9th has been carrying large quantities of rice. According to statistics, by the evening of the 12th, more than 165,000 bags of foreign rice will have arrived in the city. This includes 17,500 bags of rice from Vietnam brought by the French postal ship "Général Metzinger" on the 9th; 25,000 bags of rice brought by the Japanese ship "Borneo Maru" on the same day; 10,500 bags of rice brought by the Jardine Matheson postal ship "Chilipa Talbot" (transliteration) yesterday; and 25,000 bags of Saigon rice that were also loaded on the "Pugerville" (transliteration), which arrived in Shanghai this morning. In addition, there is also a Jardine Matheson ship that will bring 15,000 bags, and the French ship "Pierre", which will arrive in Shanghai on the 12th, will bring another 43,000 bags of Vietnamese rice to Shanghai. According to shipping sources, at least 100,000 bags of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai before the end of this week. The total import volume for this month should reach 600,000 bags. According to business sources, in the first two months of this year, nearly 1 million bags of foreign rice have been shipped to Shanghai from Vietnam, Burma, and Thailand, averaging 500,000 bags per month. This month may break this record.</p>
<h3>The Entire City Will Fly Flags at Half-Mast Tomorrow to Commemorate the Death of the Founding Father. The Spiritual Mobilization Anniversary Will Be Held Together.</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the 16th anniversary of the death of Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the nation, and the 3rd anniversary of the National Spiritual Mobilization. Various circles in the city, given the special circumstances, will not hold any ceremonies. However, in order to commemorate the revolutionary achievements of the founding father throughout his life and his spirit of great fearlessness, it has been decided to fly flags at half-mast for one day in accordance with the regulations on commemorating holidays and hanging flags agreed upon by various groups and the authorities of the two concessions. All citizens will voluntarily suspend entertainment and banquets and observe vegetarianism to express their condolences. All government agencies, schools, and groups will be closed. Moreover, at this time of war, citizens should emulate the founding father's spirit of perseverance, hard work, and dedication, and strive to work hard to win the final victory and complete the great cause of resistance and construction.</p>
<p>Flags at Half-Mast, Entertainment Suspended</p>
<p>Various circles in the city, in order to commemorate the difficulty of Premier Sun Yat-sen in creating the Republic of China, have decided to follow the wartime revolutionary commemoration measures. The measures agreed upon are as follows: (1) All government agencies, groups, schools, factories, shops, and households throughout the city shall fly flags at half-mast for one day to express their condolences. (2) At 12:00 noon, all citizens shall stand in silence in their original positions to mourn the revolutionary history of the founding father's life and to express condolences for the soldiers and civilians who died in the resistance and construction efforts. (3) In addition to voluntarily suspending entertainment and banquets, all citizens shall continue to promote the movement to save on entertainment expenses, labor expenses, and donate money to strengthen the resistance and construction efforts and complete the great cause of nation-building.</p>
<p>Spiritual Mobilization, Third Anniversary</p>
<p>Tomorrow marks the third year since the announcement and implementation of the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline. In order to show their support for the national policy of resistance and construction and to implement spiritual mobilization, all circles of citizens in the city have decided to uphold the supreme principles of "Nation First" and "Ethnicity First", to focus on the sole direction of "Military First, Victory First", and to concentrate their will and power to fight together. At the same time, they oppose any political party that uses the name of resistance and construction to carry out separatist activities and undermine unity, as this would hinder the implementation of the Spiritual Mobilization Outline and plunge the people into an abyss of no return.</p>
<p>Businesses Closed, Concessions on Alert</p>
<p>In addition to flying flags at half-mast in accordance with the commemorative measures, the Jianghai Customs, the First Special District Court, the Higher Second District Court, the Postal Bureau, the Postal Savings Bureau, the members of the Yinqian (banking) industry, various groups, and various factories in the city have decided to close for one day. All businesses that need to be handled will be postponed to the next day. The authorities of the two concessions will step up security measures starting today, after banning gatherings and associations.</p>
<h3>New Commander of the US Defense Forces, Howard, Arrives in Shanghai. Baker Will Be Transferred Back to Washington. Many Believe the US Is Strengthening Its Far East Policy.</h3>
<p>Colonel Howard, the new commander of the 4th Marine Regiment of the US Navy stationed in Shanghai, is expected to come to Shanghai within two months to take office, succeeding Colonel Baker. Colonel Howard has not previously served in China, but has served in the US Marine Corps for 27 years. He graduated from the Naval War College and the Senior Class of the Marine Corps School. He enlisted in the Marine Corps on May 11, 1914, and has been stationed in Santo Domingo and other places, participating in battles and making significant contributions. He was promoted to the rank of colonel on September 5, 1938. He has served in the Marine Corps Headquarters in Washington and is currently the commander of the 6th Regiment of the US Marine Corps, stationed in San Diego, California.</p>
<p>Commander of North China Also Ordered to Return Home</p>
<p>Colonel Bonner, commander of the US Marine Corps stationed in North China and the detachment of the Marine Corps protecting the US Embassy in Beiping, has received orders to return to Washington. He will come south to Shanghai on March 18 and return to the United States on the 22nd aboard the President Taft.</p>
<p>All Parties Expressed Enthusiastic Expectations for Baker</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" commented that upon hearing the news of the transfer of Colonel Baker, commander of the US 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, people both in China and abroad wished him a safe and smooth journey. Colonel Baker has a wide circle of friends, treats people kindly, is knowledgeable, and well-informed. Because his interests are not limited to one aspect, his friends are not limited to American expatriates. His departure from Shanghai means that the Shanghai community has lost a capable and promising figure, which is regrettable. The US authorities' recent transfer of the commander of the Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai shows that they have not forgotten the Far East. Baker's return to the country to work in Washington will give us more security. The United States' recent recall of officials stationed in Shanghai, North China, the Philippines, and Guam is intended to listen to the military situation west of the "International Date Line" and the most recent and direct developments. Those who fear that the United States is about to abandon its established Far East policy can rest assured after hearing this news. We firmly believe that the United States' repeatedly reiterated policy, even if it changes at this time, will be to strengthen it rather than weaken it.</p>
<h3>Westerners Eager for China to Unite and Resist Aggression: Letters Published in Western Newspapers Expressing Opinions</h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" yesterday published a letter from a foreigner, Mr. S. T. Roberts, urging China to uphold the spirit of unity and jointly resist foreign aggression. The letter stated: Since the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived in Shanghai, he has denied the existence of a Sino-British military agreement. This rumor has also been denied by the Japanese. However, since the surrender of Vichy France and Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, Japan's southward ambitions are like an arrow ready to be launched. However, due to the concerted efforts of China and Britain, actual difficulties have been encountered. Foreigners in China who are true friends of China now hope that all parties in China will allow their National Political Council to adopt effective measures to resolve various issues. This measure will not only resist aggression, but also protect the interests of all countries in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Two Famous Foreign Correspondents Leave Shanghai for Chongqing to Gather Firsthand Information</h3>
<p>Mr. Tillman Durdin, formerly a well-known Shanghai correspondent and now a special correspondent for the "New York Times," and Mr. Michael Donald, a famous correspondent for the "London Times," bought tickets to Hong Kong and Chongqing the day before yesterday. The purpose of their trip is to understand the situation in China's wartime capital, gather firsthand information, and write special articles to send back to their countries. Therefore, all parties in Chongqing attach great importance to and welcome their trip.</p>
<h3>President Coolidge to Leave Shanghai Tonight, Small Number of American Nationals Evacuate, Perception of Seriousness of Current Situation in Far East Reduced, 8,000 Bags of American Relief Rice Unloaded Yesterday</h3>
<p>The President Coolidge, a ship of the American President Lines, on its return voyage from Manila, delayed arrival to Shanghai repeatedly. The company announced last Saturday that it would arrive in Shanghai at 10 p.m. on the 9th, as previously reported. Unexpectedly, it failed to arrive on time the night before last, only entering the port at 6:30 a.m. yesterday and docking at buoys 12 and 13 around 8 a.m. Passengers disembarked at the Customs wharf around 10 a.m. According to the company, the reason for the delay in the ship's arrival was mainly due to strong winds at sea the day before, which slowed down the ship's progress. Therefore, the ship's departure time from Shanghai has also been changed to 7:30 p.m. today. The last tender will leave the Customs wharf at 6 p.m. tonight.</p>
<p>Evacuation of American Nationals Eases</p>
<p>Although the situation in the Far East is still unstable, the issue of American nationals evacuating from the city has become more relaxed. It is reported that only about 100 American nationals, mostly women and children, are scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States on the President Coolidge today (the 11th). Many believe that the sharp decrease in the number of American nationals evacuating shows that the previous concerns of American nationals about the situation in the Far East have lessened. In recent months, all the President liners leaving Shanghai have been fully loaded with evacuating American nationals. Among the American nationals departing from Shanghai on the President Coolidge today are Mr. and Mrs. Collins, secretaries of the American Consulate, and Ms. Bai Longfei, a teacher at the Shanghai Jewish School. Among those arriving in Shanghai on the ship this time, in addition to the new Spanish Consul General, there is also Mr. Dunn, the Far East Manager of Warner Bros. Pictures. Mr. Dunn refused to discuss the political situation, only saying that he had traveled to South China, Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and India. The film industry in Singapore and India is now growing rapidly, and several large cinemas are under construction in India.</p>
<p>Red Cross Relief Rice Arrives with the Ship</p>
<p>8,000 bags of American rice, transported by the American Red Cross to assist civilians in Central China, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (the 10th) on the President Coolidge. They will soon be distributed in the Shanghai concession and occupied areas. Mr. Lee, the head of the American Red Cross, said that this is the second batch of American rice transported for distribution. The previous batch arrived here in February last year. Another 8,000 bags of American broken wheat are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tonight on the SS Tjitjalengka and will soon be distributed in the occupied areas of Central China to relieve the poor. Members of the Red Cross were dispatched to pick up the relief rice yesterday. According to the members, the American rice is the same as domestic rice and is better than the foreign rice from Thailand, Vietnam, and Burma. However, it still needs to be investigated to confirm that it is officially American produced.</p>

<h3>Western Newspaper Advises Japanese Foreign Minister to Tour Britain and America First to Understand the True Strength of the Democratic Front, Unimaginable Consequences if He Listens to Hitler</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" had an editorial yesterday commenting on Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's visit to Germany and Italy. The content was quite sharp, stating that Matsuoka had announced that he would visit Berlin and Rome upon invitation. The world's first thought about this would be that the Axis powers are preparing a full-scale attack on Britain. No matter what suggestions Hitler makes to his followers, Britain will certainly not be unprepared and will be able to respond to the situation at any time. Therefore, if Matsuoka continues to blindly follow Hitler and rashly attacks democratic countries, the unimaginable consequences will be borne by no one other than Matsuoka and Japan.</p>
<p>Tour America First for a More Realistic View</p>
<p>Matsuoka has not yet set off, and based on his past credibility, we dare not say that Matsuoka will definitely visit Germany and Italy unless his train has already departed. We still have time to suggest that instead of taking the Siberian route, he should go through America to gain more experience. We urge Matsuoka to stop in Honolulu for a day to see the United States' huge fleet. The second stop should be a trip across the American continent, where he can see 130 million people building the great arsenal of democratic countries, countless factories stretching along the way, smoke rising to the sky, 3,600 miles of green fields yielding abundant grains, enough to submerge the island nations, the affluence of the living standards of men and women, and their determination to rescue democratic politics.</p>
<p>Visit London Next to Recognize Their Determination</p>
<p>Next, Matsuoka can stop in London to see a small nation that has not been conquered by bombs and incendiary bombs. Although its planes are few, it can still resist violence. Even in the midst of bloodshed, it will not stop until it achieves its goals and completes its mission. However, Matsuoka's greatest lesson will not be learned from America or London, but from Italy. When he meets Mussolini, we don't know what they will discuss. Mussolini may ask the Japanese Foreign Minister how it feels when houses built of sand collapse in an earthquake, how to deal with a large country suffering from hunger and cold, where to get food and arms, and where to sell raw silk and products. If Matsuoka understands this, he may not need to go to Europe to study various issues.</p>
<h3>Allied Union Bank to Open Soon</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai business community has formed a new Allied Union Bank. The bank is a financial institution mainly composed of the Securities Exchange, the Foreign Exchange, Gold Exchange and Cotton Yarn Exchange, with a paid-up capital of two million yuan of national currency, plus the large amount of security deposits of all brokers in the four exchanges mentioned above, so its strength is quite strong. It has its head office at 201 Tianjin Road and a savings department at 260 Tianjin Road. The general manager is Mr. Pan Sanxing, the manager is Mr. Dai Jilun, and the deputy managers Mr. He Yiyun and Mr. Sun Yangnong are all well-known figures in the financial world. In the future, the bank's prospects will be unlimited. It is said that preparations are now complete and it will officially open on the 15th of this month.</p>

<h3>On Montage Photography - Lang Jingshan</h3>
<p>Montage photography refers to the process of assembling the scenes from multiple negatives and projecting them onto one photographic paper. Often, due to unsatisfactory details in certain areas of a single negative, the entire photograph is rendered unusable. However, by assembling the good portions of various negatives and appropriately joining them, the result is enhanced. This not only transforms unusable scenes into ideal landscapes, but it is precisely the purpose of montage photography. The technique was first seen in advertisements or photographic games, but these involved cutting and pasting various scenes together in a patchwork manner, or creating bizarre and whimsical subjects to elicit laughter. However, the traces of the patchwork are clearly visible, and upon closer inspection, the result is uninteresting. Montage photography, on the other hand, is different. Although it also involves combining elements, the artist's ingenuity and manipulation during the projection process create a seamless effect, making the grafting and transformation seem natural, unlike the results of cutting and pasting. This is also the principle of Chinese painting, which is now being applied to photography. I will describe its meaning and methods below for the study of those who share my interest. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Pine Tree on Huangshan Peak</h3>

<h3>Iron Factory Manager Zhang Zhiyao Abducted Yesterday, Suddenly Kidnapped After Leaving Factory, Abductors' Car Discovered</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhiyao, a native of Ningbo, 59 years old, resides at 104 Rue Tenant de la Tour (now Chongqing South Road) in the French Concession. He owns Zhang Xiji Iron Factory at 50 Route de Paillet (now Pailou Road) in Western Shanghai, where he serves as general manager. He has a chartered car for transportation. Yesterday at around 6 p.m., when Zhang finished his work and was leaving the factory in his chartered car, four abductors suddenly appeared on the road. One of them brandished a gun, threatening and intimidating him, forbidding him to make any noise. The other three abductors dragged Zhang out of the car. They forced him into a white-license car (Registration Number 18089) that was parked by the roadside. The abductors got into the car one after another and drove off at full speed, heading west. In an instant, they were nowhere to be seen. It was found that car No. 18089, used by the abductors, belongs to the Fuzhou Motor Company at 715 Fuzhou Road in the International Settlement. Three abductors hired the car from the company beforehand, instructing the driver to drive to Gordon Road (now Jiangning Road). They ordered the driver to stop in a small alley near a Japanese cotton mill. Suddenly, another abductor with a gun approached the car, drove the driver out of the car, and hijacked the car. After watching the car disappear into the distance, the driver returned to the company to report to the police. The police immediately dispatched detectives to investigate the scene and conduct an investigation. The car was found in Western Shanghai at 10:30 p.m. and has been notified to the Fuzhou Motor Company for collection.</p>

Several years ago, he opened a theater in Suzhou. Now he lives at home and rents out empty rooms, acting as a second landlord and lending money at high interest rates. Unexpectedly, at 7:20 p.m. last night, three bandits with guns and knives broke into his house and went straight to the second floor. As they were approaching the bedroom door, Wang walked out of the room. The bandits pulled out their guns and fired two shots at Wang without asking any questions. Wang was hit in the left waist and right leg, fell to the ground with serious injuries, and bled profusely. However, fearing that he was not dead, the bandits stabbed him twice in the left arm with a knife, left the knife on the ground, and fled separately. Afterward, the family reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The ambulance corps was then called to send Wang Xingyan to Renji Hospital for treatment. The injured is facing a life threatening situation. According to ____, the reason for the attack was a revenge killing.</p>

At the same time, the Central Police Station also sent Chinese Detective Inspector Wu Yaozu and Detective Zhu Wanjun to assist in the siege. When the detectives arrived, the thieves were just breaking out of the door. The guard at that location, No. 1009, fired two shots, but they missed. As a result, detectives from both police stations apprehended the thieves Chen Shoushan, Zhang Hailin, and Liu Youru, and confiscated a gun, four bullets, a fake gun, and stolen goods including several hundred dollars in banknotes and 59 silver dollars (Bao Xing was robbed of a total of 1,700 yuan).

<h3>Food: Why Not Rice Weevils Storing and Tigers Raising Prices, A Single Move Creates a Windfall Profit of Over 50 Million Yuan, The Quality of Rice Sold Worse and Worse, The Price of Rice Raised Higher and Higher, Let Them Curse, I Will Earn My Wicked Money Myself</h3>
<p>The rice market has been soaring and chaotic recently, with prices rising every day. Rice merchants refuse to sell rice and have not been selling for almost a month, brazenly disregarding everything and endangering the people's food supply. Even without violent coercion, the major rice merchants are not bringing rice to the market, which is tantamount to an "alliance to strike." Their crime is greater than violent coercion. Violent coercion endangers the food supply and violates criminal law, but they not only escape punishment but also, after this price surge, the premium for foreign rice is as high as 2,500 to 2,600 yuan per hundred bags, and recently it is still 2,200 to 2,300 yuan. According to the cost calculation, each bag earns more than 30 yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai rice merchants and major rice dealers' action of holding back and raising prices this time is likely to create a windfall profit of over 50 million yuan without any effort, all stripped from hundreds of millions of people. Such a way to make money has never been seen before. No wonder they don't care about curses and earn their wicked money themselves.</p>
<p>Although the premium for foreign rice on the black market fell back by 2, 3, or 4 yuan yesterday, the nervous situation that is difficult to end has not moved at all. Because the increase has been too large and the decrease is very small, and major hoarders harbor ulterior motives, if there are no effective measures to regulate the rice market, how can they relax and leave a little food for the city to survive? These money-obsessed merchants and tycoons will never be so "generous." What is most hateful is that the rice they sell is getting worse and worse, the price is getting higher and higher, and they still want to scare the consumers, saying that the source of rice will be cut off, scaring ordinary consumers, who have no money to buy rice, but if they don't buy rice, their hearts will jump around. Ordinary rice weevils laugh when they see the crying consumers. Some people even curse</p>
<p>"Death". They spent more than 3,000 yuan to buy one liter of rice to eat, but were insulted by the rice weevils. It is as if they took money to beg for rice from the rice weevils. If you ask them why the rice is so bad, they will immediately show you their anger. You want it, buy it, you don't want it, forget it. It's good enough to have rice to eat.</p>
<p>All crows are black, the rice-hoarding tigers are nature, and the rice-selling ones are eroded, harming the lives of the public. Even now, the serious situation is not addressed. As soon as the market opened yesterday morning, it was indeed sluggish due to the high price. More than 10,000 bags of new goods arrived from the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships, and three or four French ships followed. People's minds were immediately calmed down. The premium for each hundred bags of small dumplings fell from 2,300 yuan to 2,100 yuan, the premium for each hundred stone of Saigon No. 1 and 2 fell from 2,200 yuan to 2,000 yuan, and broken rice fell from 1,100 yuan to 1,000 yuan per hundred stone. No. 1 rice was opened at 99 yuan per market stone, and the situation was stable. Later, customers from Nanyang and the interior took the opportunity to inquire, and new hoarders also took the opportunity to absorb. The total transaction volume in the street was less than 3,000 yuan, and the customers hoarded 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to pour in. The French company's Kimdia ship, directly from Saigon, transported 1,250 tons of foreign rice, about 13,000 bags, which arrived in port on the morning of the 9th and berthed at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. Also, the Java Company's Tjiieboet ship, loaded with 1,000 tons of foreign rice (about 10,500 bags) from Hong Kong, berthed at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong for unloading. The French company's Bagdhavell ship, also transporting rice from Saigon to Shanghai, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday, but had not been seen entering the port until late at night. It is expected to arrive today. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick and thin Japonica domestic rice is still limited, it is heard that the foreign rice black market has suffered setbacks, and people's minds have also turned to retreat. The guest side feels that they are in a high and dangerous position, and is afraid that the situation will change suddenly, so they rarely make progress. Generally, cargo owners in this environment want to rebound, but are unable to, and the intention to sell thin Japonica prices has fallen by two or three yuan. It is estimated that Kunshan's dou sees white Japonica at 121 yuan, high Japonica at 122.5 yuan, Changbang's dou sees Zhente Japonica at 127 to 128 yuan, high white Japonica at 124 yuan, and Qingjiao's dou sees thin rice at 120 to 118 yuan, and Feilaifeng at 120.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Amidst the sounds of foreign rice in the black market, glutinous rice, because it is not subject to restrictions, has shifted its focus and is paying attention to it, resulting in a broad path. Cargo owners are unusually eager to rebound, and the market price alone has seen a rise of about two yuan. Hong Kong Zhenzhen's special group of white glutinous rice has actually broken through the 100 yuan mark, opening at 102 yuan. The price of general market goods ranges from 100 yuan to 98 yuan, and the price of medium-secondary goods ranges from 97.5 yuan to 96 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market: Initial Rise, Then Stabilization</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: Yesterday morning, the flour market opened with the momentum of the weekend, with internal and external buyers stockpiling and competing to purchase. Speculative activity was particularly fierce. Zhonglou brand Australian flour opened at 31.5 yuan and soared to 32.5 yuan, increasing by almost a yuan in an instant. Jinlong brand Henan flour at 30 yuan was also in high demand. However, the Huachang mill's flat-priced flour officially began supplying the market yesterday, with 5,873 bags provided to this district. The Fufeng mill temporarily suspended supply due to material shortages, and the deficit was supplemented with foreign flour. Furthermore, after the rice price rose and then fell back, people's anxieties eased slightly. Consequently, sales of foreign flour in the later market decreased sharply, and buyers stopped stocking and started selling, causing the market to ease by 20-30 cents. According to industry insiders, there are still 300,000 to 500,000 bags of foreign flour in whole lots that are expected to arrive soon. If there is no arbitrary price manipulation by speculators, the market may decline.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the market situation remained firm. The supply of inland Dumai wheat was scarce. Although Japanese mills attempted to lower prices, they found it difficult to procure supplies. Huachang mill was even more unable to purchase any wheat, effectively ceasing operations. The market was calm and unusually quiet.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Stockpiling Rice, Also Stockpiling Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the market for miscellaneous grains and oil beans, corn continued to rise by a yuan due to stockpilers promoting a southbound advance. The inland sales of bean cakes were budding, and stockpilers seized the opportunity to accumulate inventory, so the market price continued to rise by about half a yuan. Transactions included three carts of Yuanlong cakes, priced at 16.55 to 16.8 yuan; three carts of Feizi cakes, priced at 16.4 to 16.8 yuan; 4,000 pieces of Shengji cakes, priced at 16.4 to 16.8 yuan; and 3,000 pieces of Lizi cakes, priced at 16 to 16.5 yuan. Other prices experienced small rebounds, mainly because scattered stockpilers sold off some of their holdings, which slightly lowered the market. Yellow beans fell by 50-60 cents. Peanut oil remained stable. Soybean oil spot prices fell by two yuan, and futures initially fell by two yuan before rising again, but ultimately declined by a yuan compared to last weekend. Furthermore, on the 11th, 800 bags of soybeans were exported to Singapore, and 5,450 pieces of bean cakes were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance: US Dollar Weakness, Especially in Futures</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Yesterday, the HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American currency saw a downward trend, as operators believed the increasing war atmosphere in the global situation was a negative factor. Speculators sold heavily, especially U.S. dollars for immediate delivery and March. However, British banks such as the Mercantile Bank absorbed some. Supply and demand were relatively balanced, with the transaction price generally at 5.53125 yuan. The noon closing recovered slightly, but it hardened again in the evening. Ultimately, the spot U.S. dollar closed at 5.53125 yuan, and the shilling at 3 pence 375, a decrease of 0.03125 yuan compared to last Saturday. The British exchange rate remained stable, but there was a greater decline of 0.0625 yuan for this month.</p>
<p>Chinese Banks Sold</p>
<p>In the early morning, exchange rates for British to American and Shanghai currencies were stable, and American to British and Shanghai currencies remained unchanged. The central exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 pence 375 for British gold and 5.5 yuan for U.S. dollars, the same as last Saturday's closing prices. The market hardened after opening, as Chinese banks all intended to sell. They sold spot U.S. dollars, with the Mercantile Bank absorbing at 5.53125 yuan. At 9:30, HSBC exchange rates remained unchanged, and the price of silver also remained stable. Speculators also followed suit and sold, but the favorable absorption kept the balance. March U.S. dollars were entered by speculators at 5.53125 yuan. Until the noon closing, speculators stopped selling due to tight positions, and prices softened again.

<h3>Negative News, Gold Market Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for refined gold saw a sharp decline, retreating to within 6,300 yuan. According to reports, domestic buyers were cautious. The US Senate passed the Lend-Lease Act, and sellers and speculators did not dare to act easily. Therefore, after the market opened in the morning, supply and demand were balanced, and prices hovered around 6,300 yuan, briefly rising to 6,308 yuan, with minimal changes. Suddenly, Hengji and Chengji came in with large amounts of selling, triggering a decline. As currency dealers entered, the market did not break out of its range. In the afternoon, Dafeng and Defu also began to dump gold, and as the US dollar showed signs of weakening, the decline intensified sharply before the evening closing, retreating to a low of 6,230 yuan, ultimately dropping by 80 yuan. The total trading volume was about 20,000 taels. People's confidence was somewhat shaken. In the morning, a cash dealer sold 50 taels to Xianghe at a price 420 yuan higher than the futures price. In the afternoon, Chengji sold another 110 taels to Xianghe at a price 430 yuan higher. Gold jewelry prices were down by 10 yuan, totaling 680 yuan. Customs Gold and other prices remained stable.</p>
<p>Refined Gold Also Plunged 80 Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, the price per tael (ten taels) was slightly stronger in US dollars, but the market momentum was weak. At 9:15, the market opened and immediately retreated to the 6,300 yuan mark, 20 yuan lower than last Saturday's noon closing price. Under selling pressure, it dropped to 6,290 yuan. Dacheng, Yongcheng, and Da bought in, pushing it up to 6,308 yuan. Suddenly, Hengji and Chengji began to dump gold, and Defu, Gonghe also competed to sell. The foreign exchange market weakened, and there were reports of Hong Kong sellers dumping gold, gradually lowering the price by 38 yuan to 6,270 yuan. Xianghe, Tongkang, Shunyuan bought in, and Xinfeng, Yongfu bought over a thousand taels. By noon, it had reached 6,295 yuan, and the noon closing was 6,293 yuan. When the market opened at 2:00 p.m., it rose by 7 yuan to 6,300 yuan, but then showed a steady downward trend. As the foreign exchange market weakened and the US dollar showed a downward trend, Dafeng and Defu also started dumping large amounts of gold, and Hengji also competed to sell without stopping. The price ultimately dropped by 70 yuan, fluctuating by only about 10 yuan in the middle, and fell to a low of 6,230 yuan. Before closing, it ended at 6,240 yuan, a sharp drop of 80 yuan compared to last Saturday's noon closing. Based on the settlement price of 5.53125 yuan for March US dollars, it was counted at 6,295 yuan, a difference of 55 yuan. After closing, it rose to 6,245 yuan, with a total daily fluctuation of 78 yuan.

<h3>Minor Fluctuations in Foreign Currency</h3>

<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Mostly Bullish, Remaining Momentum</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for public bonds saw a sharp decline due to unfavorable conditions, threatening to break the six yuan barrier. However, due to the strong bullish position, the market continued to rally, making efforts to prevent breaking the barrier. This proved effective, and in the afternoon, Ding bonds were raised again, as they were relatively cheaper. Consequently, other bonds also rose slightly, indicating that the bullish position was unwilling to relax. The market price ultimately showed mixed results, with Ding bonds up by 55 cents, Grade A bonds slightly up by 5 cents, and Grades B and C up by 40 cents. The trading volume was approximately 2.45 million yuan. A summary table is provided below. In stock trading, 100 shares of the Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 20 yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Covering Shorts and New Buying Arrive, Yarn Market Moves Upward, But Actual Sales Remain Scattered</h3>
<p>After falling for two days, the yarn and cloth market rallied yesterday due to improving news, with sentiment turning upward again. Short positions were covered, and new traders returned, gradually raising market prices. However, actual transactions and separate purchases continued, but wholesale development remained lacking. The market outlook was slightly more stable. 20-count Double Horse yarn reached a high price of 1,370 yuan and a low price of 1,361 yuan. In the afternoon, due to strong investor sentiment, the initial trading price was 1,386 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that foreign exchange rates were lengthening, gold prices had fallen back, and securities shorts were increasing their positions, causing the market to fall back to 1,368 yuan, with the lowest price at 1,371 yuan. Today, 15 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with mild sentiment, with an initial price of 1,365 yuan, falling slightly to 1,361 yuan shortly after. There was some discussion claiming that Japanese troops had withdrawn from Beihai and the shipping route to that county had resumed, with many buyers. The market gradually rose to 1,375 yuan. Unexpectedly, gold prices fell, weakening sentiment, and it fell back to 1,362 yuan. However, buyer sentiment remained strong, and the market was tight, gradually rising to 1,378 yuan at closing. A total of 8,480 bales were traded, with a breakdown of purchases by various groups as follows.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Virtually Stalled</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is as stagnant as ever. All parties' thoughts are dim and lacking vigor, which makes the cotton market feel even more desolate.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was lively and excited due to continued good trade in cotton cloth and continued forward purchases by the textile industry. As a result, closing prices were up two to ten basis points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Indian cotton did not see much fluctuation, with yesterday's forecast down slightly half a rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading continues to be stalled and virtually stopped. The market situation is bleak, and all parties show no interest.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Expectation of Guangdong Sales, Cloth Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was vigorous, because the recapture of ports such as Guangdong's Northwest Beihai opened a chance for rising sales. Sentiment turned upward, and dealer and stockpilers' buying resumed, causing cloth prices to rise sharply. Fine Guigui cloth opened in the morning at 42.5 yuan, up 50 cents per piece from last Saturday. It continued to rise by 50 cents in the afternoon. Other fine cloths and twills rose by 50 cents to one yuan. Coarse cloth and coarse twills rose by 25 to 50 cents per piece. Bleached cloth also rose by about 50 cents. Over 500 pieces of various cloths were traded in this district. Sales to customers were slow. Zhejiang's Ningbo dealers traded 50 to 60 pieces of colored cloth, coarse cloth, and fine cloth. Fujian dealers traded 30 to 40 pieces of colored twill and coarse cloth. Today, 700 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, as the yarn market rose, people inside and outside the industry were unanimously optimistic, and the intention to buy was strong. Fine white goods rose by one yuan per piece, fine twills rose by 50 to 75 cents, and serge rose by about 4 cents per yard. The highest spot price for Longtou fine cloth was 47.25 yuan, with the closing price slightly down to 46.9 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge rose to 1.3375 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Continues to Fall</h3>

The Guild's dividing price was 80 yuan for current stock, a decrease of a few cents; for the 20th of this month it was 80.01 to 80.02 yuan; for the end of this month it was 80.6 to 80.7 yuan; and transshipment was 64.5 yuan.

<p>Chao school has recently lacked continuous arrivals, and dealers have been constantly raising prices. Yesterday, according to customer letters, production prices rose again by 10 yuan, after having already risen more than 30 yuan before. This item is inherently a coarse product, but the price increase compared to normal market prices is nearly 20 times. Even compared to last year's exchange rate, it has risen by more than double.</p>
<h3>Coal: Tongdeli Lump Coal</h3>
<p>Market Price Unofficially High by More Than 30 Yuan</p>
<p>Tongdeli lump coal, recently the company's listed price, although still at the original price of 245 yuan, there are only listings and no sales. Warehouse inventories have been exhausted, and new goods are expected to arrive only after a week. Therefore, the market price is chaotic. The unofficial price has been bid up to more than 260 yuan, an increase of more than 30 yuan compared to last month. The price increase is very intense. Local street shops deliver to customers at 276 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Coil (Raw Material for Factory Nails) Prices Also Rise Consequently</h3>
<p>New coil is the raw material for manufacturing factory nails. The rise and fall of these two goods are closely related. Since yesterday and the day before, hardware products have generally risen due to a lack of overseas sources, which has caused these two goods to rise as well. Although Shanghai's inventory is still abundant, industry insiders have extremely strong and optimistic sentiment, and standards are rising steadily. It is heard that yesterday's bid for new coil increased from 115 yuan to 130 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and the price of factory nail bases also increased from 100 yuan to 110 yuan per barrel. Transactions have been prosperous due to the rising market, with purchases from screw factories, nail factories, and construction companies.</p>

<h3>Owner of the Jialin Scholarship, Mr. Zhu Xiaoqin's Autobiography</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Xiaoqin's Ninetieth Birthday Autobiography</p>
<p>In the first month of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, I held a small gathering at the Fachang Temple monastery and presented fifty autobiographies to those present. This is not literature, but rather something to which I am attached.</p>
<p>My family has lived in Hai'ning for generations. My great-grandfather, Duke Zixi, established a cloth shop in the family. My grandfather, Duke Dingjiu, and my father, Duke Luqin, continued his business and were quite well-off. I have two elder brothers, both of whom died young. My uncle's brother is more than ten years older than me. As a son born late in life, I was even more favored by my parents. Within the family, harmony and joy prevailed.</p>
<p>At the age of six, I entered the neighboring private school. Because of his love, my late father did not strictly demand my studies. At the age of ten, I transferred to Dacai School. Before graduating, my family experienced many misfortunes. My uncle's brother had already passed away, and then my kind mother also passed away. My late father's business also suffered repeated losses, eventually leading to closure. At the age of seventeen, through the introduction of my cousin-in-law, Mr. Yu Zhixian, I entered the Shanghai China Educational Instrument Company to study.</p>
<p>Several years later, admiring those from my hometown who had achieved prominence in officialdom, I visited their homes and obtained a letter of recommendation. After many twists and turns, I succeeded in becoming a small member of the cargo hold on a Yangtze River steamer of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. My monthly salary of six taels of silver was not enough to meet my needs. My heart was filled with constant sorrow. Late at night, when everyone was quiet, I picked up a book, and it described the principles of being a person. Upon examination, it was Zeng Wenzheng's Family Letters. I could not help but rise solemnly, raise my head to think, and thought that Zeng Guofan, as a person, could still endure hardship and self-discipline. Who am I to dare to think recklessly? From then on, the desire for a fortunate advancement no longer arose. Although my income was meager, I often borrowed money to make up for it.</p>
<p>During the Xinhai Revolution, the steamboats were crowded. Once the passenger capacity was full, even a small space could be sold for dozens of taels of silver. I gave up my sleeping quarters to the passengers and slept in the cargo hold instead. After several trips, I earned over a hundred taels of silver. I also engaged in selling goods to earn extra profits to support my family and repay my debts. At the age of twenty-three, I married Ms. Yu. At that time, my late father had been unemployed for a long time and was old and ill. Therefore, I brought my family to live in Shanghai. Three years later, I joined the American-owned Lida Foreign Firm in Shanghai as a salesman. This firm sold inks, machinery, and paper used in printing, which allowed me to get acquainted with many people in the printing industry.</p>
<p>During the years of the early Republic of China, the establishment of exchanges in Shanghai sprang up like bamboo shoots after rain, covering all industries. This was the so-called stock market craze. I initially entered the Shanghai Securities and Goods Exchange as a broker. Later, I also worked as a broker at the Shanghai Night Market Exchange, and as a standing director of the Paper Industry Exchange. I also went north to Tianjin to work as a broker at the Tianjin Exchange. Throughout the year, I barely had time to warm my seat. However, all the exchanges collapsed one after another. Tianjin and Shanghai were no exception, and they all vanished like fleeting clouds. Among them, only the Paper Industry Exchange was fortunate enough to dissolve voluntarily and return the principal to its shareholders. During its heyday, the staff of the top-tier exchanges in Shanghai wore light furs and rode fat horses, like princes. But when it declined, they all woke up as if from a dream and sighed at the ceiling. At that time, I was fortunate that Heaven did not abandon me, and I was also fortunate that I had not lived extravagantly. Therefore, although I remained the same after gathering the remnants, I was still content with simple clothing and meals.</p>
<p>A year later, at the age of thirty-two, I became the manager of Datongyuan Paper Company. Having experienced the vicissitudes of life, I dared not boast of myself. Every time I estimated expenses, I had to sell a certain amount of goods each day to maintain it. When I left the house in the morning, I always set a goal for myself. If it was not enough, I would not stop even at dusk. After years of this, I gained a little.</p>

<h3>Propriety</h3>
<p>— Lu Han</p>
<p>I suppose someone must have died, because my father told me to deliver a gift. You have to give gifts for happy events, and you have to give gifts when someone dies. Weddings, funerals, celebrations, New Year's gifts, holiday gifts – Chinese people have so many gifts to give! Giving a gift and then having a celebratory drink makes sense, but does anyone give a gift and then buy a plate of tofu skin to eat? No, the envelope clearly says "Substitute Paper Money," which means it's for the dead. I found it strange. Did the dead really reach out of their coffins?</p>
<p>I'm not young anymore, but this was the first time I'd experienced something like this. So my father, in a solemn and serious manner, carefully explained to me all the rules of entering the house, the etiquette of leaving, and the complete set of procedures. He even told me to kowtow a few times to the dead person. What a joke! I don't even know who died, and I certainly don't understand what relationship I have with them. I didn't know them in life, and now that they're dead, I'm supposed to kowtow and pay my respects for no reason. It just makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>Walking into the mourning hall wasn't quite like walking into a government office or the palace of the King of Hell, but it was still solemnly and terribly silent. It wasn't quite the three kneelings and nine kowtows of a court audience, but the etiquette was still quite complex and grand. In the midst of the mournful music, people were led one by one to the altar before the deceased to kowtow, kneel, and bow. Unexpectedly, the person leading the way took me to the accounting room instead. I was pleasantly surprised to be treated with such favor, amazed to be looked upon so differently. I thought they were really clever, guessing what was on my mind and sparing me from doing something I didn't want to do – paying respects to a dead person I didn't know. The person leading me said "Delivering a gift," and someone inside replied, which meant this was where you gave the gift. So I presented the envelope containing two dollars' worth of paper money. The person inside handed out a piece of paper and two dimes. Oh! I almost cried out. They thought I was a servant!</p>
<p>I froze, didn't reach out, and didn't know how to respond. The person seemed to understand the psychology of a servant and said, "Take it!" and gave me a mocking and sly smile, as if to say, "Are you still going to pretend to be polite?" At that moment, I felt anger, hatred, and shame. I wanted to explain that I didn't need the two dimes, but who would believe me? I looked down at my patched-up long gown and my broken shoes. Who would believe that I wasn't a servant? Strictly speaking, the clothes of a regular servant are probably more respectable than mine! They were even elevating me! A servant is still a person, so it wasn't an insult to me. This was better, because it spared me from kowtowing to that little natural wonder, and I was happy to take the two dimes.</p>
<p>Back home, I recounted the whole story from beginning to end. My mother was angry, and my father sighed, regretting that he had sent such a clumsy fool to make such a big joke. I just felt hatred. I hated them for judging people by their clothes, for having such a low opinion of people. I took out the thank-you note and the two dimes. Oh no! Did I give the gift to the wrong family? How did the Gong family's gift end up at the Shi family's? Everyone's attention focused on the thank-you note. It turned out that several families were holding funerals in the same temple! How awful! Another round of scolding and sighs. My father scolded me for being incapable, my mother scolded me for being so careless, my sister scolded me for being useless, and everyone scolded me for being stupid. I had nothing to say, just a belly full of hate. My father was scolding: "...You're not young anymore, but you don't understand anything about social customs and etiquette. How are you going to make your way in the world?"</p>
<p>I tore the two dimes in my hand into pieces. It was like tearing through people's masks, tearing through some kind of darkness, and also like tearing up a hypocritical, ridiculous, contradictory, and uncivilized "propriety." It was also like getting revenge on something, and I felt a little better.</p>

<h3>Before and After Divorce</h3>
<p>— Li Yuying</p>
<p>My father passed away when I was eight years old. Thanks to my kind mother's hard work, I was able to grow up and receive a secondary education. When I was nineteen, a relative came to act as matchmaker. My mother listened to the matchmaker's words and agreed to the marriage. I got married that winter. Although my husband's family was very wealthy, my husband's temper was extremely violent, and he also engaged in prostitution, gambling, and all sorts of dissipation, neglecting his proper business. I spent five whole years in this terrible environment, enduring mental suffering. He squandered all the inheritance and spent his days at home picking fights. I couldn't bear this kind of pain, and if things continued like this, I couldn't imagine what the future would hold. I had no choice but to separate from him. Our son, who was only four years old, I would raise. I couldn't bear to leave the child with this unconscionable, corrupt father, lest it ruin the child's life.</p>
<p>Now I am divorced, but the inner wound will never be erased! I am living under economic pressure and mental suffering!</p>
<p>A few months ago, a relative (male) said that my life was too lonely and that I should have some proper entertainment. He knew that I was short of money, so he treated me to the movies several times. We were very open and honest, and there was nothing improper about our behavior, so we didn't hide anything. I thought going to the movies was a very ordinary thing, especially since we were relatives. Who knew that my cousin would treat this as news and spread gossip everywhere? Soon, all the relatives and friends knew about it, and everyone was slandering me behind my back, saying things like a woman shouldn't remarry after one marriage, and that I was seducing people! All sorts of insulting words. These outdated and stubborn words came from the mouths of young people who had received a considerable education. Isn't that ridiculous? Instead of pitying me for my misfortune, sympathizing with me, and helping me, they were jealous of me everywhere and looked down on me. They only flattered and were friendly with the wealthy relatives. How snobbish people are, and how cruel people's hearts are! Besides, they had done inappropriate things in the past. Now that time has passed, have they forgotten? They are still righteously laughing at others! My reputation has been ruined by them and cannot be restored! I might as well take this opportunity to change my life, and remarriage after divorce is not illegal. It is very common in society now. However, when I think of my cousins' future cold taunts and sarcasm, I don't know how I can bear it. I really don't have that kind of courage!</p>
<p>If I want to be self-reliant, finding a decent job is harder than climbing to the sky. Besides, I am a woman with only a junior high school education. Is there any place for me in this society?</p>
<p>I have had suicidal thoughts twice: once because I couldn't bear my husband's anger, which made me want to die; and once recently, when I was subjected to this unwarranted insult. In such a miserable environment, I was subjected to this unexpected blow. I only wanted to die to escape this sea of suffering! But after I die, how will my old mother and child live in the future? This forced me to dismiss the idea of suicide and continue to linger in this evil world.</p>
<p>Every day, I waste away the years in the city of sorrow. In front of my mother, I have to force a smile, lest she see the sadness in my heart and add to her worries. Only late at night, after my mother and child are asleep, do I dare to cry secretly! I only hope to become a numb and insensitive person who can forget all the pain! I am like a lost lamb, and I don't know how I will live my life in the future.</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(5) The Division between East and Desire</p>
<p>Begonia was a female role on stage. For several years, though he'd almost grown tired of performing love scenes, offstage, he was still a lonely young man. This wasn't to say he only ever wanted to play a fake woman on stage, being a wife to bearded old men and powdered young men. Nor could it be said that he absolutely didn't need love offstage. Quite the opposite: he needed it too much! Ever since his mother had passed away, he'd been living an extremely lonely life. Even though so many managers and underlings lived in the house, none of them were able to talk things over with him. The only relatively compatible person was Zhao Yukun, but that guy liked to drink, and he was only home for a day or two out of the entire month. And even during those days, he was only awake for a very short three or four hours. Begonia himself inevitably had some social engagements, so the two of them rarely had a chance to talk.</p>
<p>No matter how quiet Begonia's personality was, he was still a young man in his twenties. How could he feel content in such a lonely and uncomforting home? When he had something to be happy about, there was no one to tell; when he had something to worry about, there was no one to share it with. All day long, he was just singing, rehearsing, and doing vocal exercises – a whole set of tricks, just like a monkey being played with. In this situation, since he was a person, and a young person full of life, how could he not need 'love'?</p>
<p>Those women who developed certain ambitions towards him because of watching his performances were, in theory, a kind of malicious temptation, but in effect, they did achieve some of the desired results, at least often reminding him that he should be looking for an object to pour his love into.</p>
<p>Last year, Yuan Shaowen also intended to introduce a young woman from a family of performers to Begonia as a lifelong companion, in his capacity as a good friend. But it didn't work out, because Begonia himself didn't agree.</p>
<p>'Although I am a performer,' he said, 'still, thank you for your guidance these past few years, which has enabled me to be not too different from the average young person studying in school in terms of my actions and learning. So I believe I should also have the freedom to choose a wife. I'm very sorry, Seventh Master, I cannot love that girl!'</p>
<p>'Then what kind of woman would you like?' Yuan Shaowen asked with a smile.</p>
<p>'A woman who completely suits me,' Begonia replied, seemingly very confident. (51)</p>

<h3>My Views on Improving Kunqu Opera: Improving on the Two Shortcomings of Aristocracy and Conservatism</h3>
<p>— Song Ruinan</p>
<p>History is cruel; it will ruthlessly abandon everything that does not conform to the trends of the times. The same is true of drama. The plays of the Jin Dynasty, the zaju of the Yuan Dynasty, and the chuanqi of the Ming Dynasty all failed to withstand the test of history and withdrew from the stage of history. Now, Kunqu opera, which was most popular during the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras, has also embarked on its final path and will soon become a relic of history.</p>
<p>The decline of Kunqu opera is certainly the result of the natural development of its inherent shortcomings, but we cannot deny that it also contains many advantages. For example, its lyrics, from a purely literary point of view, are unmatched by other types of drama. Furthermore, the moving plot, the rigorous structure, the musical coordination, and the delicate performance are also unattainable by other types of local opera. However, these advantages cannot offset its two major shortcomings: aristocracy and conservatism. Because of its aristocracy, it ultimately remained in the atmosphere of the literati and could not be popularized among the masses. However, the literati class itself has also reached its twilight years, and the gradual decrease in the audience is a matter of course. At the same time, because of its excessively strong conservative color, it ultimately became disconnected from the current trend of the times—therefore, Kunqu opera gradually declined.</p>
<p>However, Kunqu opera is, after all, a unique flower and exotic plant in Chinese art and literature. We do not want to let it fight death alone, but at the same time, we do not want to pass it on to our descendants "as is." We must try to save it while at the same time improving it, so that it can eliminate the two major shortcomings of aristocracy and conservatism and become a popular modern drama.</p>
<p>However, it should also be recognized that it is Kunqu opera; it has its roots, characteristics, and audience. It was originally something to be sung and danced on the red carpet, so we cannot improve it from a position that violates musical drama. If its principles are violated, the result of the transformation will be a new thing, not an improved Kunqu opera. The result will not only fail to win new audiences, but will also reduce its old customers. This should be noted. Now, to the best of my limited knowledge, I offer some suggestions:</p>
<p>Selection of scripts: The content of the scripts should focus on reality as the theme. This can be divided into several aspects: First, it is necessary to stimulate the audience's awareness of loving the country and the nation. For example, "The Peach Blossom Fan" depicts the national struggle at the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty. In particular, the scene of Shi Kefa's martyrdom can move people even more. Jiang Shiquan's "Winter Green Tree" depicts the struggle between the Han and Mongolians at the end of the Southern Song Dynasty. Among them, Wen Tianxiang's unyielding and killing, Xie Fangde's starving to death for his country, and Tang Jue's stealing and burying the imperial bones can all inspire patriotic emotions. Furthermore, "The Record of Washing Gauze" depicts King Goujian of Yue's ten years of recuperation and ten years of teaching and training in order to restore the country and avenge the humiliation of the country, which can make people realize what to be vigilant about after watching it. Second, it is necessary to praise the heroism of the military. For example, the "Iron Crown Picture" in the other mother random arrow two-fold, depicts Zhou Yuji's family martyred the magnificent country, and then such as "Loyalty Notes" depicts Yue Wumu's resistance to the enemy, and such as "Inverted Loyalty" depicts Song Ze's spirit of resistance to the enemy, are very in line with the requirements of the times script. Third, in this turbulent era, we must especially promote national integrity, so the "Herding Sheep Record" depicting Su Wu's mission to the Xiongnu, the "Green Tomb Record" depicting Zhao Jun's throwing herself into the river, and the "Assassination of the Tiger" depicting Fei's palace maid's revenge for the country can all be staged more often.

<h3>He Tianbao of Washing Floating Mountain</h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>He Tianbao of "Washing Floating Mountain" is a serious opera for old male roles of both civil and military types. Because Beijing opera emphasizes civil over military, "Washing Floating Mountain" is rarely seen. Old Tan was skilled in martial arts, and Liu Chunxi was known as an old male actor of both civil and military types, so naturally they both knew this play. Yu Shuyan also had a considerable foundation in martial arts. Rui Debao was a martial arts actor of the Huang School who later also sang old male roles in the Tan School. Li Shaochun, Gao Shenglin, Li Wanchun, and Liu Zongyang all perform old male role plays, so they can also perform "Washing Floating Mountain." In addition, Wu Niu Yang Shengchun, Li Shengbin, and Jiang Shisheng can also sing "Washing Floating Mountain," but they only perform the martial arts scenes and do not include the later "Entrusting Dreams" (which has a long anti-second section). In fact, "Washing Floating Mountain" is a play that old male actors of the Tan School should learn. Once they learn this play, "Battle of Taiping" (Replacing Arrows), "Selling the Horse" (Essential (It's not difficult; even learning the drums in "Scolding Cao" is much easier, because the double sabers in "Battle of Taiping" and the mace in "Selling the Horse" are both derived from the double sabers in this play. If you can play the double sabers well in "Washing Floating Mountain," the strength in your left and right wrists will be even. People who learn to play the drums are often weak in the left wrist (Jia Jupeng suffered from this problem). If you have the foundation of "Washing Floating Mountain," you will not have this problem.

<p>Chapter Two: Stalwarts from the North are Quick to Lend a Hand</p>
<p>Liu San held up the large cup. Xu Jing refilled it for him and invited him to drink. Zhang Cangqiu quickly drank three or four gulps, emptying it. He said to Xu Jing, "I drink very fast; you drink yourself and don't bother refilling it for me. I'll do it myself, it's more refreshing that way." Xu Jing also drank a small cup and told Liu San to hurry and heat up more wine. Zhang Cangqiu drank cup after cup with gusto, keeping Liu San busy heating pot after pot of wine on the stove. Xu Jing also invited him to eat some dishes. Zhang Cangqiu saw a bowl of cooked soy sauce chicken in the center of the table. Without standing on ceremony, he picked it up with both hands and tore into it, finishing it in a flash. The two ate and discussed current affairs. Zhang Cangqiu said, "Here, we have wine to drink and chicken to eat, but I've heard that in Shaanxi and Gansu, there's such a severe famine that the fields are littered with the corpses of the starving, and the trees have no bark left. The most terrible situation is in Yan'an Prefecture. This is what a refugee who escaped from Yan'an told people, and it's absolutely the truth. From last year to this year, not a drop of rain has fallen, and the vegetation is scorched, and the rice paddies have all died. In the eighth and ninth months, people went to the mountains to gather and eat Artemisia plants. Although these things are [unreadable] objects, they're like chaff, bitter [unreadable] in taste, and very difficult to eat. But by the tenth month, all the Artemisia had been eaten, and they had no choice but to strip the bark from trees to prolong their lives. By the end of the year, the bark of all the trees everywhere had been stripped bare, leaving a thousand miles of red earth with no food to be found. With no other options, people dug up rocks from the mountains and forced themselves to swallow them. But the rocks are cold and have a fishy smell. They certainly fill the stomach when swallowed, but sadly, within a few days, their bellies swelled up, and they died. So everyone had no choice but to become bandits and steal to eat. Dying of hunger and dying as a thief are both deaths; it's better to die a thief and at least be a well-fed ghost than to starve to death sitting still. Therefore, bandits have sprung up like bees there, causing a terrible mess. It's not easy for ordinary people to escape. If the chaos there cannot be quelled, and if it grows too large and becomes impossible to control, I'm afraid it will be difficult for us to enjoy peace and security here." After listening to Zhang Cangqiu's words, Xu Jing also sighed, "A single spark can start a prairie fire. The downfall of the Eastern Han Dynasty began with the Party Prohibitions, followed by the Yellow Turban Rebellion, when various heroes rose up, and people like Dong Zhuo and Cao Cao seized the opportunity to usurp power, and the world descended into chaos that could not be contained. It seems to me that the current situation of our dynasty is somewhat similar to the end of the Han Dynasty; moreover, there are Tatars waiting outside the pass, waging war every year, which is even more dangerous. We were born in a chaotic world, filled with unfounded anxieties, unable to become Zhang Liang or Chen Ping, nor able to be Lian Po or Li Mu; what can we do, what can we do!"</p>
