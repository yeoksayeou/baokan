<h3>日極端派主要領袖　東條英機受命組閣</h3>
<p>素以擁護田中侵略政策著稱　今後動向頗引起各方面注目</p>
<p>合衆社十七日東京電　日皇今日下午令第三次近衛內閣之陸相東條英機中將組織新閣、日皇命令東條組織新閣之前、曾與宮內大臣木戶子爵及元老大臣會商遴選新內閣領袖人選、</p>
<p>路透社十七日東京電　近衛第二及第三兩决內閣之陸相東條、已奉命組織新閣、先是掌璽大臣木戶曾與元老開會、參加者有樞密大臣原嘉道·前首相若槻禮决郎男爵·廣田弘毅·岡田啟介大將·林銑十郎大將·阿部信行大將及米內光政大將、會後當向日皇推薦東條為　任首相、東條即於下午四時三十五分被召入宮、奉組閣命令、離宮後、前海相及川立即相繼召入宮中、聞日皇曾以任命東條組閣事面告及川、按此種行動、並非創例、當一九四〇年一月十六日海軍大將米內被任為首相、日登亦會親召畑俊六大將入宮也、沓東條係於一八八四年生於軍人世家、一九一五年畢業於陸軍參謀大學、一九一九年任駐德陸軍武官、一九二二年任參謀大學敎官、一九三四年任第二十四旅團長、一九三五年任憲兵司令、一九三七年任關東軍參謀長、後調任陸軍航空機監、一九四〇年七月近衛第二决內閣成立被任陸相、</p>
<p>路透社十七日倫敦電　路透社遠東專家宣稱今日奉命組閣之日本陸軍中將東條、久已被認為日本帝國主義侵略派最熱烈領袖之一、自一九二八年之田中大將內閣以來、除一九三九年秋間曾短時期任首相之阿部大將外、陸軍大將之任首相者、富以東條為第一人、就東條之經歷而觀、可表示其對於田中奏摺完全贊成、東條為人坦直光明、態度極為忠實、但為極端派主要領袖之一、此决奉命組閣、正可證實一般人對於近　辭職所抱之意見、即極端主義現已勝利是也、至於是吾將進而為行動及向任何方面發展、則均為另一問題、</p>
<p>路透社十七日東京電　據此間一般人之預料、新內閣自將顯明處於軍事勢力之下、惟對新閣之可能人選、則尙無可靠消息可得、</p>
<p>路透社十七日東京電　前海相及川繼東條被召入宮事、已引起此間若干人士之揣測、衆料係與保證海軍贊助陸軍內　事有關、</p>
<p>合衆社十七日東京電　日本官方新聞機關同盟社稱、日本消息靈通方面本日相信、新內閣將不採取任何激烈新政策、但將集中以更大之決心、推行日帝國之基本政策、彼等謂　期新內閣對於國策將獲得完全一致、因第三决近衛內閣之崩潰、即係由於未能一致、彼等指出日本之一定政策、為解決中國事件建設「東亞共榮國」及依附三强公的之精神、彼等更力言新內閣將致力於實現日本之主要目的、即不懂維持東亞之和平、目將維持全世界之和平、同時前內閣陸相東條已在陸軍省設立總部、依照日皇之命令、積極設法組織新內閣、</p>
<p>日本重行傾向軸心　太平洋上烽火漫天</p>
<p>合衆社十七日華盛頓電　消息靈通界昨日相信、近衛內閣總辭職之事、為日本親軸心份子之勝利、同時此間報稱、近衛將其玫府之將來、繫於對美之談判、是以近衛辭職或表示談話已不成功、消息靈通界稱、日本新內閣如係由軍人及新納粹份子所組成、則將表示日本已準備對蘇聯開啟戎端、乘後者在西陲對德國掙扎之際發動戰事、消息靈通界稱、彼等深悉在美日談判兩月中、日人堅決拒絕考慮退出德義軸心之建議、認為此的並不妨碍對美諒解、消息　四人士刻正密切注意外相人選、蓋美日談話之失收、乃因日本不能解決國內主戰派及自由黨之爭端、而美國外交家對應向日本孰一團體會商、始可獲得日本遵守協定之保證一事、無所適從云、</p>
<p>路透社十七日倫敦電　今晨英國各報並不因莫斯科之嚴　局勢而忽視日本閣潮、泰晤士報社論謂東條之任命、可認為係日本重向軸心及華盛頓談話切實終止之先聲、德軍向莫斯科及頓河流域之前進、必巳誘使極端份子認為再作前進之時機已經來臨、此近衛內閣之所以傾覆也、此間消息靈通人士預料東條所領導之日新政府、或將非北攻即南進、因而引起太平洋之烽火、亦屬可能、</p>
<p>路透社十七日新加坡電　此間負責人士對於日本閣潮之重大意義、雖不準備發表任何意見、惟皆不禁回憶上次近衛內閣的三月前辭職後、未滿一週日軍即已開入越南如合格觀察家則以為不　此决閣潮之結果如何、現時已有明白之徵象、表示日本之激烈愛國份子已準備以國家之命運、置於納粹極端派之手、此輩之忍耐心、已為華盛頓談話之進行所磨盡、其平日所作之危言、或已聳動日人相信即使作犧牲之戰爭、亦愈於革命也、新加坡無綫電　晚評述日本閣潮時、謂日人已準備北進攻蘇或南進攻泰之藉口、或竟雙方同時并進、遠東緊張距離破裂之點、從未有較此更近者、繼日本今後行動者為何、殆　疑義云、</p>
<p>日軍人急進派抬頭　或將對蘇開啟戒端</p>
<p>路透社十七日新加坡電　此間聞日內閣辭職消息、不以為異、數星期來早有日本軍人急進派漸形不靖而欲作一種政變、以恢復其威望之明白　微、同時非軍人份子亦欲於軍閥暫時喪失威望之後、從軍閥手中奪取若干眞正政權、近衛內閣係　軍民兩派份子組成者、以對美妥洽之可能性勉力拖延時日、今時日拖延已久、而衆口喧騰之對美妥洽迄未有在近衛內閣所可接受的條件上演成事實之象、至是近衛內閣乃更難支持矣、過去一週之間題與其謂為近衛內閣之將吾辭職、不如謂為內閣之能吾與軍閥對抗、故一般感想以為確無可　者、此决由內閣辭職、乃一種孰佔優勢之眞正決定、與以前內閣辭職逈乎不同、日本國內氣氛已極緊張、不能再容有猶豫不決也、當德軍漸近莫斯科外郊之時、日本閣潮竟告發作、此可見軍閥要求於莫斯科陷落時淮兵蘇聯、而非軍人派則不準備贊同、此問人士預料在新閣組成以前、必有不少之討論、屆時握取大權者究為車閥歟、抑平民派能如其所减削滅軍閥權力歟、當有明白之表示、日本國內現仍為人重視之日皇地位現曖昧不明、若干時前衆覺日預料亦亟欲裁抑軍閥、故有全國大本營之組織、以期遏止極端份于、但聞由此而後陸軍已對日皇力諫矣、目前所可影科者、繫於今後數日內或若十小時內東京所舉行之討論者、不僅為日本軍閥在其國內之前途、且為日本出兵攻蘇與遠東和戰之整個問題、</p>
<p>遠東紅軍實力雄厚　日如北侵必遭痛擊</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十六日倫敦電　據此間蘇聯方而消息、日本內閣更選之後、遠東方面不論發生何項事變、紅軍在西伯利亞實力充足、均能應付裕如、緣蘇聯東部後備兵之開往西綫者均係應徵入伍之新兵、並不削弱西伯利亞駐軍原有實力、要之西伯利亞紅軍配備整齊、從事機械化之戰爭、以視日軍為優云、</p>
<h3>白宮召開特別會議　商討應付遠東危局　軍政重要領袖均出席</h3>
<p>路透社十七日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統咋忽召開特別會議、與會者有國務卿赫爾·海長諾克斯·陸長史汀生·陸軍參謀長馬歇爾·海軍參謀長史泰克與赴歐視察之總統私人代表霍甫金等、討論遠東局勢與租借案問題、壓一小時又三刻鐘之久、散會後赫爾告新聞記者、渠奉命不得發何言論、渠亦不知白宮將吾發表文告、記者間以將再集會吾、赫爾答稱不久應再開會議云、其他與會者亦同樣奉命不發言論、</p>
<h3>東報對美　續施抨擊</h3>
<p>若杉再訪威爾斯　美日談話無進展</p>
<p>路透社十七日東京電　外務省喉舌日本廣知時報今日載方抨擊美國之遠東政策、稱日本之努力改善美日關係、徒為單方面的親善、該文先述美國在遠東事務中之越俎各節、其尤甚者為援助重慶、致重慶現用美國軍械美國子彈美國技術匡助與日本對壘、美國對於重慶且予以軍事上與金融上之擘畫、繼謂美國人民苟能就雙方比較觀之、則當知日本作不平之鳴、實有正當之理由、其取自衛計畫實行所當爾、日本人民仍將力主美國大變其政策、首當對中國停止為重慶戰爭之合夥者云云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十七日華盛頓電　日本駐美大使館顧問若杉·本日訪晤國務剽鄉威爾斯有所商談、歷時四十五分鐘之久、</p>
<p>海通社十七日東京電　日政府發　人石井昨日稱、渠不信在華盛頓進行之美日談話、巳獲有如何進展、但會談並未中止、尙在繼續進行中、同盟社昨日曾抗議美國之延宕政策、此舉實可代表日本大多數人士之態度、關於若杉有無會見美國務副卿威爾　、　尙未獲悉、</p>
<h3>遠東局勢　盒臻嚴重　格拉第之觀察</h3>
<p>路透社十七日舊金山電　羅斯福總統遠東經濟調查員格拉第、頃由遠東返抵此間、據其語人曰、日內閣之辭職、已引起甚危險之局勢、渠信日本下任內閣將為嚴格之軍事傾向、須知凡內閣之有專事傾向者、隨時皆有危險也、格氏又調訪問荷印時、荷印政府會示以種種、彼等對於任何緊急、均有充分之準備矣、</p>
<h3>美國商船奉令　退出中日沿海　美艦在冰島附近中魚雷</h3>
<p>路透社十七日華盛頓急電　負責方面表示、所有美國商船、現因海軍方面所謂「太平洋局勢」之故、已奉令退出中國及日本領海、</p>
<p>路透社十七日馬尼刺電　據尙未證實之謠傳、所有在太平洋航行之美輸、均已奉令立即駛至最近之英美口岸、高級海軍官員對此謠傳不置批評、惟據某航業領袖語人、美國航務委員會所屬之巴拿馬貨輸「披里達」號、已奉海軍命令駛返馬尼刺、</p>
<p>路透社十七日華盛頓加急電</p>
<p>據官方宣布、美驅逐艦「寇爾奈」號、今晨在冰島西南的三五〇哩處命中魚雷、係與上决被攻擊之美艦「格里爾」號在同一區域、「寇爾奈」號為美國最新式驅逐艦之一、甫於去年造成、排水量一·六三○噸、上裝五吋口徑砲位、艦長為台尼斯上校、該艦祇有二烟囱、與移交英國各驅逐艦之有叫烟囱者顯然不同、據海軍官員語人、此點可减少被誤認為英艦之可能性、美海軍部中、現接報告未提及傷亡、該艦雖受創、仍能藉其自己之力量進行、</p>
<h3>東條略歷</h3>
<p>合衆社十七日東京電　以心理稅敏著名、似傾向溫和國家主義份子而不主極端之　條英機中將、巳奉命組閣、東條之主張同時搆成對蘇對華兩陣綫、尙不過數年內之事、東條於衛第二第三兩任內閣均任陸相、在日本陸軍界為最著名人物之一、觀於日本　官均呼以Kamisori之軍名、即可知其為人、此「剃刀」一語、即係日人用以譬喻心機靈敏者、東條之氣質　一秉其父、所謂「有其父必有其子」、良非虛語、東條之父為一大軍事家、一九〇四至一九〇五年間日俄戰爭時、曾協助川上將軍籌劃軍事、此位昨日辭職之陸相自一九三九發表一驚人演說之後、遂成為舉國欽仰之人物、一九三九年為平沼內閣寺代任陸相著為板　、東條為陸軍　次官、其時有日本軍火製造業者會、東條即蒞會發表演說、主張日本有同時　　處前綫與中　兩國交戰之必要、并預言日本　勝、一九三九年八月平沼內閣之地位、因日本拒絕與　心國締　軍事同盟後、德　締結互不侵約　生動搖、終於辭職、其時東條即任陸　航空　　部軍事航空　監及總司令、自是東條之任辭職、直　陸相　後　軍事訓練繼監山田中　等推蔗其為近衛　閣之陸相進止、東條於一九一五年卒業於　官學校、一九　九年赴德任陸中武官、從事研究、　學識時考　歐洲一般情事、返國後於一九　年任　官學校教授、在陸相以　、會任陸軍省種種職務、東條於日本陸軍航空、之擴充及改造頗為努力、任陸相後會語新聞界云、「予於政治一無所知、茍詢予　航空事務、則予可盡最為君等告、讓賣新聞」　　東條將　除飲酒外、別無嗜好、荀一開始飲酒、則竟能連飲至二三日不休、「　知新聞」則誷東條係絕不嗜酒者、該　稱、據東條夫人云、其夫於飲酒時、輒　飲啤酒一二杯、東條夫人又曾其夫平　生活云、「渠每日起床甚早、唯一嗜好即為誦　世界偉人傳記、有時予並見其聞　經濟書籍、予夫婦生有子女各三人、而渠對其子女之志向從不加以干涉、渠對弱者頗為和善、平日絕不詈罵僕人、　每餐食量甚少、而身體則殊康健」、東條將軍係生於一八八四年十二月、其原籍為日本北部Ｉwate縣、</p>

<h3>英美以全力援華　解決經濟上各問題</h3>
<p>倪米亞爵士招待渝報界代表　二民主國政府完全推誠合作</p>
<p>重慶　英國經濟代表團主任倪米亞爵士、今日在此第一决接見中外報館代表時、曾曰、一余之來此、乃求得讅一切、而毫無成見、故目前對於中國之財政經濟狀况、不能發表任何言論、此行目的、乃在與中國當局會商、以查明中國狀况之特點、及能吾以余在他國工作時所得之學識與經騐、補助中國解決各問題、諸君當知余乃由世界另一部分奉命來此、而敝國刻正在該部分從事苦戰、且有自己之財政經濟問題、英國具至殷切之忱、願盡其力之所能、對中國經濟之維持與發展有所貢獻、」當時美財部代表柯克朗等亦在座、據柯氏談稱、關於此來之目的、倪爵士已詳言之、無待贅述、渠留華之期、恐不能如倪氏之長久、惟美政府已有若干經濟家在渝、平準基金會委員克斯即其一也、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>重慶　英國財政經濟代表團團長倪米亞爵士、及美財部專員柯克朗氏、十七日上午十一時、接見陪都中外記者、發表談詁、闡述該團來華之仟務、倪氏首稱、吾人甫來中國、一切</p>
<p>尚待研究</p>
<p>、故無正何成見司言、吾人希望提供在歐洲及其他各地所得之經騐、以助解決中國之問題、吾人將首先就特殊問題、與中國各當局從事商討、余當本國正從事大戰、且有其自身困難之時、由世界之彼方被派來華、顯足表示英國對於中國之</p>
<p>真實同情</p>
<p>、吾人希望盡其所能、貢　於中國之經濟、以期達到解決特殊問題之目的、余與柯克朗君來此、係遵循英美援華之政策云、倪氏繼稱、中國外滙平準基金、僅為外滙問題之方面、倪氏返復申述、對於解決此等問題、盡量提供吾人之意見、為吾人來華之</p>
<p>唯一目的</p>
<p>、柯克朗君能與余同來、余極表欣快、此足表示中英美三國政府完全合作、解除困難問題之決心、而此等問題、惟有合作之努力方可獲解決、柯克朗為美財長摩根索之專家助理、柯氏對記者稱、余被派來華、且與倪米亞爵士共同工作、</p>
<p>非常欣喜</p>
<p>、倪米亞爵士與余、在歐洲及美國均會共同從事於各項事務柯氏並稱、倪米亞爵士此决在華盛頓時、會親見美政府正在推進援助民主國之政策、柯氏謂、余在華期間、將不如倪米亞爵士之長、但平準基金委員會委昌福克斯、戴樂諸君、均仍留此、福克斯君等已得中國方面之</p>
<p>多量合作</p>
<p>吾人願蜴其所能、以助中國云、柯氏亦係初决來華、渠稱、代表團蒙中國之盛意招待、預料留渝期間、必極愉快云、决倪米亞爵士又稱、渠有巴克斯德在此相助、殊足欣慰、巴氏前任泰國財政顧問、現任緬甸財政顧問、倪米亞爵士對巴氏</p>
<p>備致推崇</p>

<h3>物價不易安定之因素</h3>
<p>自最近物價又一度暴漲、頓使擁有資金者，以為法幣將無從收拾、只知囤槓為事、不問物品之優劣。投機者以為機不可失，期貨市塲中翻江倒海，物價掀騰不已。隨之而生活上所必需之一切物資，如米煤油麵衣着房租之類，無一不高抬其價値。輿論所在，皆為如何節制物價之惡性膨脹、維持大衆應有之生活權利。今工部局總裁已有正式表示、將採取適當處置、以相調整，並謀建立一管理零售物價之機構，迅將發表重要文告。茲故不欲有所論列、惟盼於此遠東時局日見緊急中，早日付諸實現。</p>
<p>要知今日之物價，各方實有以促成之，如無物產封鎖統制，仍得流通自如，土貨決無如是之昂貴。上海向以洋貨集中之口岸、亦為消費最巨之地域，叵耐歐戰日益擴大，洋貨到源日稀，而一般之消費，不改故常，供求之差額愈遠，囤積之風尙益深，釀成高高無比之物價，亦事之無可奈何者也。然此固為物價之漲因，而不能謂今日非常之物價，盡為此故：蓋掀動物價，使之扶搖直上期貨市塲固有以促成之也。溯自戰事發生，本祇現貨買賣、故雖有漲落，多少受其牽掣，變動殊緩。自烚赤有期貨，棉紗棉布有期貨，油餅有期貨，美鈔有期貨，乃至洋糖有期貨，以少量之證金，做大宗之買賣，贏錢撲賭之投機分子，頓時如虎傅翼、一發不可遏制。遂以期貨牽動現貨、使現貨積之價格飛昇不止。即今日所見之幣値，又未始不因投機囤之徒，將物價操縱得無限大、遂反映幣價乃至無限小，此固一種幻象耳，甯可作為眞實觀？</p>
<p>有謂此不然，姑不論貨幣購買力之大小如何，但所以表示幣値者外滙耳！今之法幣對外滙率如何？猶以為非法幣本身之過，其誰信之？誠然，吾人雅不欲以中央掛牌為言，即以過去黑滙論滙率之步步降低，猶是一種消極抵抗，為法幣謀保護；不然，如仍維持法定之匯率，法幣尙得有今日之地位？即今日平準會之工作，亦為保護法幣計耳；此在東西各國，早已實行，惟我中國至今方始學步。猶是內憂外患，頻頻打擊，國人不知贊助，反行破壞，出口外滙理應照結而不結，非必需品進口可省而不省，再黑滙不應使之發生而仍日有所聞；資金無所用其逃避，偏欲以物品外幣作隱藏之護符·造成漫無止境之高物價：而不念一再高抬之物價，實際上亦減削其資金之效用；乃執此不悟、猶以為得計，愚誠不可及。至因投機而遭失敗，更無論已；是以大衆苟欲淪法幣為廢紙則已，不然，唯有贊助國策，與平準會取合作行動，方為滿而不溢之上。。</p>
<p>但平準會之工作，人言藉藉，作何進行，不無使人疑慮。蓋所供給者究有多少，所得供給者究為何業。就所聞以相推測，烟葉尙有外滙可供給，則必需之性質重於烟葉者，如食物衣着之類，更易獲得外滙。前聞專映外片之一輪戲院，非供給外滙，不易照常映演，今仍映演如故，若非獲得供給之保證，恐無如是之甯謐。是則外邊謠傳，平準會對於上海外滙—某月供給若干。遞减至某月將不復供給之說，為無稽　為不足信，蓋奢侈性事業之外匯、尙且供給，豈有其他生活品應需之外滙獨靳而不予，可決其無此事實。如米所需外滙，以有工部局公賣米在。可無問題。至煤，在外邊頗有不易得申請外滙之說，雖不知其眞實如何；但煤業所購得之煤　如何保證其不外流，此與棉號之申請購棉外滙同一性質；惟可言者，電力公司所用之煤，宜可獲得外滙之供給，故電費應平。至紗廠所用之棉，應同樣處理，但人心不古如今日孰能保證其所購得之棉、不移花接木。糖本屬奢侈品，惟其程度亞於烟葉。然上海以外滙進糖，而上海之糖，復為人販運以去，是上海之糖外滙，消耗將無所底止，誰有此大量供給，以維持糖之消費。由可知申請外滙之不易獲准，，亦為商人自取其咎，而帶累大衆耳！工商界能處處以國利民福為重，意志純正，則一切困難迎刃而解；上海應得之外滙，亦不患無着，上海之物價，亦不難獲得相當之安定。惟在平準會亦應將其核准供給上海之外滙，予以公布，或許有其未便公布處，免致搖動市面。竊以為此固無庸顧慮，光明則魑魅遁形、公開則謠詠不興。惟其公開，使公衆咸明瞭於此而有外滙供給、此而無供給，庶不致涇渭不分。物價亦得有準則可資比較：奈何秘而不宣，豈為獲取外滙之工商界、發意外財作隱藏之地步耶！</p>
<p>所不解者、供給外滙既限於十四家銀行、則英美蘇荷之貿易、盡在其中矣、出口外滙之在四國及其屬地者，宜不難取得統制；即外滙之轉帳，亦應在不許之列。今猶放任黑黑滙，俾不允供給外滙之物品、仍得騰挪移用之地步，揆之責備賢者之義、不能謂無明知故縱之意存焉！即有少數外滙游離在外，在今日美國統制之局面下，亦不難加以控制，乃復有用美鈔替美匯，以長投機囤積之風、擾亂商塲、提高物價，默爾不相取締，豈為凍結令故留一變通之餘地乎？</p>
<p>歐戰叢談</p>
<h3>莫斯科空襲紀實</h3>
<p>第四夜我決定睡任美大使住宅的地窖裏，而於黃昏時前往拜訪附近一個朋友。警報鳴，我立刻像平常樣，奔出室外，跑到街上。兩屋之間，一向僇乎是相隔很近，不料這一夜我越是着急，要趁警　　停以前跑到，那街道却越像走不完的一樣。我怕是走錯路了。後來總算跑到斯巴河大厦的方塲，方始安下了心。我衝過大門口的民團，剛好在高射砲開火之前　入地窖。</p>
<p>這夜很是安靜。我坐在地窖裏的吊牀上，和白郎神父閑談。他是個美國敎士，在莫斯科有一敎堂。這一夜地窖裏只有他和我兩個避難的人。！時二十分，一個僕人進來說警報已經解除，我和他就分手。我想乘公共汽車，電車或地下車回家，但自空襲開始，各種車輛皆已停頓，而且這時巳近宵禁時間，不能再稽遲了。我曉得巳來不及於午夜以前回寓，也不願意再冒被拘的危險，便走到英國領事館，在那裏打電話給有汽車的朋友，請他們帶我回去。可是我運氣不好，祇得在一個法國敎士的客廳中權以沙發作牀而臥。</p>
<p>兩點鐘警報父作，我們重又跑出，在花園中防空壕附近小心坐候。這一决空襲不甚猛烈，三點鍊便回沙發再睡。</p>
<p>直到現在，莫斯科並未受到轟炸的大害。街道上，方塲上和公寓房屋上，雖皆有炸彈擲下，但據官方消息，軍事目標却無一命中。</p>
<p>轟炸决數愈增，對於轟炸的恐懼則愈减。起初我一聞警報，便覺渾身癱軟，現在却能聞警不亂，且因情感的激越而忘掉了恐怖。各人對於燈火管制也已日益習慣，漸能像貓一樣的辦別夜色。轟炸已成為我生活中的一部份了。</p>
<p>多數主要食物，巳發給計　分配證，但是限制甚寬，我住在旅館裏面，　不覺得有何不便，在未被轟炸以前，我在室中會　　過幾决聚餐會，菜單以魚子醬始，而以洋莓終。荷蘭酒，威士忌，白蘭地，葡萄酒和香賓酒之類，皆山外父團中的朋友供給，他們內為不甘受到損失，所以寗願吃掉。</p>
<p>假使有人告訴我說，這樣一個京城，在戰爭期間依然有睱做配制菜單，賣共裝飾，衣着等不相干的事，我是不肯相信的。可是有人竟在這樣做着呢。可是我們也不會把戰爭輕易忘記。城中有幾處地方已經改觀，公共方塲中展覽着兩架德機殘骸—一架容克斯八十八號和一架亨克爾機—更是具體的紀念品。街道上常有兵士列隊而過，歌聲高唱入雲，有時兵士由車輛載運，爭向人民揮手。他們年富力强，容色愉快，使人見之，反覺慘然不樂。</p>
<p>好幾天以前，我往購花，向一個老店員詢問花價，他却不理睬我，原來他望着窗外過路的兵士出神，把我完全忘掉了。我的面上現出忿鬱之色。這班人眼見他們的弟兄子姪，為侵略者的野心所犧牲，其憤懣抑鬱，自非我旁觀者所可比擬了。（完）</p>

<h3>工部局將宣布　控制日用品價格　樹立新機構謀有效辦法　厘訂零售利潤防杜暴利　如有必要由局直接向海外採辦供應</h3>

<p>上海泰晤士報云、工部局總辦兼總裁費利　、昨（十六日）告記者稱、該局刻正透澈研究樹立市政機構、俾能有效的應付食物及必要商品價格飛漲之可能性、關於此事、至遲下週初可望有所宣布、至於房租之不斷增高、局方暫時不擬採行對付辦法、蓋局方已作詳盡之調查、迄未有對付此「困難」問題之任何方法也、惟局方對付任何事件之政策、並非不可變易者、但有視發展而變更之可能云、記者叩以工部局對於此間經濟上危急情況之各方面、立場如何、費氏對此等問題、或不加思索即答覆、或經考量後始覆之、</p>

<p>據字林西報云、上海法律政治機關、重床疊被、故情形較他處更形複雜、有人建議、進口商人與工部局合作、將售與零售商之批發價格、報告工部局、由工部局訂立章程、規定各項物品之售價、給與零售商人以相當利潤、深信解決物價問題、能多用理智、關對於本市愈爲有利、又據關係方面傳出消息、如工部局能出而主持直接運銷界內居民所需之生活必需品、而加以統制、平準會對於是項必需品外滙之要求、必可儘量予以供給、</p>

<p>美國總統輪公司遠東總公司、原設上海五馬路五十一號、但以遠東局勢動漫不定、該公司爲水雨綢繆計、於九月三日、由遠東總經理麥加士乘輪赴菲、籌備將上海之遠東公司遷馬尼刺辦公、據此聞公司方面、對此說已不再否認、並承認馬尼刺總公司刻已籌備竣事、總公司今後決在菲辦公、而上海僅爲辦事處、復有若干重要職員前往菲島協助一切、</p>
<p>滬美直航　並不變更</p>
<p>最近期先後分別由香港回程抵滬者、有羈勒總統輪、與處女航加入太平洋航行之范倍倫總統輪、上述兩輪、將於本月二十七日前抵此、備有足額艙位、至於批亞士·克利扶·塔虎說三總統輪、經總公司決定更名將軍號後、此後決改用新名、惟有傳美國郵船避免由滬直接駛美一說、此殆空穴來風、並不確實、起因或因此亞士總統輪上次原定九月二十七日由港開來上海赴美、旋奉命停止由滬直航返美、僅於抵滬後再返香港回美所致、上海公司對此未有所聞、</p>
<p>港馬航機　每週兩班</p>
<p>香港馬尼刺直接航空、自經關　以後、空運便捷、現聯美公司已派西哥福基式S42飛剪機、飛航港馬之間、是項飛機、已於九月二十三日由三藩市飛馬尼刺、一　美民航部批准、即可實行、此後港馬機班、將增爲往返兩此、以代波音機改航新加坡之缺、</p>

<h3>虹口各橋樑　日軍加崗</h3>
<p>虹口區日軍、自採行特別警備處置、將四川路橋加築鐵鋼、並在重要地處設置堡壘後、對於搜檢、昨日日方又在橫　橋　·施卡子橋·中虹橋·裹虹橋·外虹橋·　嘉興路橋·提籃橋·及沿斐倫路各橋樑、暨沿浦各碼頭、均加設崗位、除由日軍荷槍駐守外、（本來各橋有崗位二個、但近來久已廢棄、茲以施行特別戒備、故又復存在、）而日憲兵之巡邏隊、則自晨至夜、往來不絕、有時對車輛行人亦加搜查、此次日方採取空前未有之戒備、其用意何在、實揣難測、至於閘北江灣南方等地、日方亦已施行同樣措置、</p>
<h3>香港郵局　擴大檢郵　防違法通訉　及資金逃避</h3>
<p>據上海郵政管理局消息、香港郵政局最近積極加強由港發出之信件檢查工作、故由香港寄出各地郵件、常發現有超過應遞到之日期始克收到之現象、新驛社記者又向另一方面探悉、在港發出之郵件、最近常有發現違背戰時法令者、其中牽涉經濟·政治·金融等、及有利用郵政企圖資金逃避與作違犯金融法例之通訊者、再有如私寄鈔幣出口者、現香港郵政局爲求達到檢查嚴密化起見、特增加檢查人員、擴大檢查工作云、</p>
<h3>肉價雖跌　供給未充</h3>
<p>大陸報云、消息靈通人士聲稱、昨日（十六日）肉價大跌、市況乃見好轉、惟此間所能獲得之牲畜供給、並未增多、亦未減少、查上週傳上海近郊日軍調動頻繁、阻碍牲畜之運滬、致肉價飛漲、每斤竟售六元、今已回跌至三元左右、消息靈通方面又稱、七月初、租予日方之工部局宰牲場、工部局僅保留視察該宰牲場之權、</p>
<h3>穆罕默德昇霄紀念　教徒今晚祈禱</h3>
<p>今晚爲回教聖人穆罕默德精神昇霄之夕、本市十餘萬回教徒、在齋戒期內、除例常舉行祈禱外、特於今晚、集於各回教堂、舉行「蓋德爾」晚文　軍紀念儀式、又本市回教徒、於上月一十一日起、開始齋戒後、於本月　二十二日期滿開齋、本市各回教堂、定於是日上午八時、舉行開齋典禮、印發開齋典禮特輯、浙江路回教堂、並將於是日舉行阿拉伯教友哈費祖愛哈默德聯歡會、按哈氏在日經營商業、因受凍結資金影響返國過滬、本市教友、因適在齋戒期內、乃挽氏領導教友祈禱、並邀氏於每晚背誦古蘭經一冊、俾在一月之齋戒期中、完成三十冊全部古蘭經、因中國回教徒能背誦全部古蘭經者甚少、故在本市尚屬創舉、</p>
<h3>在華天主教士須嚴守中國法律　長沙教區當局鄭重聲明　據稱並未強迫難民向空揮手</h3>
<p>本埠天主教方濟各會總代表處、　於長沙最　事件、不勝駭異、對於十月十一十三兩日上海發表之路透社電訊、謂長沙當戰局吃緊之時、多數居民避於德義教會空院中、德義教士曾組織此項難民、而使集於廣場、當日新聞記者團飛於上空時、各教士令眾向空揮手、現已有教士十二人、因作惡意活動、被逐出境、以後自由中國其他德義教士之地位、恐將受不利影響、</p>
<p>教區當局　鄭重聲明</p>
<p>茲本市該教區當局鄭重聲明、天主教傳教士須嚴守處在國之法律、並禁止參加政治問題、彼等事業、僅限於傳教及慈善工作、蓋在中國傳教士有二十四國籍之多、長沙天主教區除德義教士之外、尚有英法教士、而該會在自由中國之代表、則係一美籍教士、所傳惡意活動、乃屬誤傳、況飛於長沙上空之外國記者、亦從未發表有天主教收容之難民揮手之消息、並據路透社續訊、委係日本不顧教士抗議、強令難民出動云、</p>
<p>傳教地位　嚴重影響</p>
<p>抗建軍興、長沙天主教士、努力本位工作、闢公教醫院孤兒院、爲難民服務、全部中學校舍、在過去四年中、無日不爲難民徵用、兩年前長沙大火時、傳教士之救濟工作、大眾公認難能可貴、今年八月三日、天主教慘遭轟炸、結果一死數教會房產及醫院均受絕大損失、服務長沙醫院之女修士與本市公濟醫院聖心醫院、以及前服務於南市難民區之女修士、同爲方濟各會之修女姆姆、慈善和藹、爲一般人士所推崇、現長沙之法德義男女教士被迫退出、則該區書院孤兒院難民收容所等慈善工作、實有影響繼續進行之不幸、如依路透社所述、情形嚴重、前途必危害在自由中國其他傳教士之地位矣、</p>
<h3>美對軸心國商號　不擬發表黑冊　滬商訂貨向須美領核准　並儘可能範圍統制用途</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨日（十六日）路透電傳、據倫　英經濟戰爭部所接情報、德國政府已正式警告南京、謂美國擬發表中國境內與軸心國貿易之商號名冊、禁止美商與之往來、故德方建議用禁此商號黑冊之傳佈等辦法、以對抗此「經濟制裁」之目的、</p>
<p>非友好國　不與往來</p>
<p>境內關於此訊、記者昨叩諸駐滬美領署某員、據談稱、美政府並未發表中國境內商號名之黑冊、但一般人皆熟知者、美國對於運至遠東或世界其他各地的貨物、尤其是戰具之用途、已加統制、此舉宗旨、當然在勿令此等貨物運抵不友好各國、是項辦法、現亦施諸上海、恰如施諸有美人貿易之世界其他各地然、</p>
<p>滬商訂貨　向須查考</p>
<p>以上海方面訂購美貨而言、訂貨人須先申請美領署之核准、而申請書上願書明貨物名稱與用途等詳情、此法適用於須領出口執照之美貨而美國之出口貨、多數均已在領照之列、美領署對於領照出口貨必加調查、以便確定其最後用途、路透電所傳各節、或即指此而言、今雖未擬定黑冊、但有若干商號、美商顯不致與之交易云、</p>
<p>概憑經驗　審慎交易</p>
<p>記者復叩以日後有無頒發此黑冊之可能、該員答稱、頒布黑冊與美商憑經驗而知不能對若干商號交易、兩者初無二致、美國對於南美洲德商號、已頒禁與貿易之黑冊、對遠東方面、則儘可能範圍、統制美貨之用途、此與南美黑冊辦法、不能比擬、美領署與此間各商號頗相熟、凡運入美貨者、皆須保證其處置美貨之途、必與美國現行政策相符、</p>
<h3>小呂宋日僑　撤退抵滬</h3>
<p>南洋各地日僑、集中小呂宋撤退來滬、候輪回國、已有數批過滬、各情迭誌前報、茲悉昨晨到滬之法郵船達得南號、經小呂宋時、有日僑百名、乘該郵船撤退來滬、該輪此次由西貢起程、經小呂宋來滬、裝苞米八千餘包、又由小呂宋裝來木料一百十八萬尺、乘客共計一百三十三人、除二十七人由西貢上輪外、其餘一百零六人均係從小呂宋上輪、其中有數人並非日人、撤退之日僑約計百人左右、該郵船進口後、停泊十一十二號浮筒、日僑均至虹口登陸、餘均至　關碼頭上岸、該輪在滬耽擱四五天、二十二日回西貢</p>
<h3>外灘渡輪復航</h3>

<h3>水木業罷工</h3>
<p>本市水木業工人、近以生活日艱、曾推代表與資方磋商、酌加工資、歷時近月、因雙方意見相左、談判不成、昨起實行聯合罷工、查該業工人共有兩萬餘眾、若任其長此罷工、實與社會上頗有影響、希望負責當局調處</p>
<h3>排水設備經費　擬發行新公債　額定四百萬元充臨時費</h3>
<p>工部局前因鑒於各馬路低窪處、每逢驟雨或江潮倒灌時、積水盈尺、阻碍交通、故決定撥款四百萬元、進行排水設備、最近並已開始工作、惟以工部局目下財政狀況、而須支付臨時費四百萬元、似感相當困難、該局財委會、爲籌劃此項鉅款、前後曾舉行會議多次、決定建議該局發行公債、刻正由該會詳細計劃中、並定下星期再召開會議、作最後決定、按該會如決定發行公債、則本年度工部局已實行兩次舉債、上次因彌補本年度財政虧空、曾舉債九百萬元、此次又擬舉債四百萬元、各方對該局此次舉動、多表示重視、</p>
<h3>人間活地獄（續）  百敏</h3>
<p>虹口區內的在日趨墮落的外人，大多數是俄人和來自德國的難民，其中也有幾百個困居上海的各國水手。</p>
<p>記者在四等酒肆裏、遇見兩個困居滬埠的美國水手，都有毒癮，當時記者坐在那酒肆的一角飲啤酒，見這兩個水手進來、在音樂停奏的幾秒鐘裏，聽得兩人的語音，知道他們是美國人。片刻，彈鋼琴的德國難民又賣力地奏起一曲來，因而聽不清兩人談些什麽，祗見其中一人喚西崽，切切耳語，那西崽便出外，片刻歸來，到兩人桌前，遞出兩個小紙包，兩人取出幾張紙幣，交西崽後，便叫了一杯伏特加酒，將一個紙包裹的粉末，傾入酒杯，一飲而盡。</p>
<p>折入一　，記者被一個斯干的那維亞半島的水手抓住手臂，乞洋一元，那人面黃肌瘦，雖站着有些搖晃，但沒酒氣，必是染有毒癮。</p>
<p>記者曾遇見困居該區已年餘的斯干的那維亞半島水手很多，他們莫不嗜酒若命，吸毒的還少；不多幾天前，他們才從本國駐滬領署領得每週津貼，口袋裏還剩着些錢，都道：「在這裏祗能飲酒取樂，爲什麽不飲個暢？」</p>
<p>住在虹口的丹麥水手，聽說有八十多人，所得丹麥領署的救濟，不過每週津貼六十五元而已，他們假使不是水手，或有人照料，也許可賴這津貼度日：但他們都是水手，流落在這外國的城市裏，無所事事，袋裏有錢，祗顧買醉，得過且過，有誰能賣他們不該呢？一個丹麥水手曾向記者問道：「你能幫助我們去香港嗎？也許我們能在英船服務，我們都願前去，祗是領署已將我們的護照收去，你有熟識的英人能相助我們去香港嗎？」</p>
<p>毒區裏的挪威水手，寥寥無幾，因爲每一挪威水手在滬辭歇，挪領署便設法將他送往香港投效英方，啟程之前，無論衣食住的費用和零用，都由領署供給，他們在虹口盤桓幾天，都亟願離開那裏。</p>

<h3>同學們的熱忱　節省零用費捐作助學金</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>現在任何大學中，皆有各省份的同學會之組織，當然我們也不例外，我們是廿幾個東吳閩南同學的一個集合體，四分之三的我們是淸寒的子弟，是靠朋友的資助，有的課餘還要做工作，故我們聚了十幾次的會，還永享到一次「可口的茶點」，或是「美味的大菜」，但是我們對出席會議的熱忱，並不因而减少，每次聚會都全體出席。</p>
<p>為了我們都是遠離家鄉的靑年，免不了有「每逢佳節倍思親」之慨，故我們當利用節日來開會，每次我們都節省茶點費和平時的零用作為捐款，幫助淸寒的子弟或兒童。今年我們太幸運了，承同學的親戚請我們去過中秋夜，受了他們很好的招待，使得我們更覺感動，就提議和前幾次開會一樣，同學們所帶來的車錢，平時節省下來的零錢，以及茶點費，都凑在一起，作為捐款。同學的親戚和他家裏的小朋友也都很同意。才集合了一百塊錢。</p>
<p>這區區一百元，我們決定作為申報淸寒助學金。同時希望各大學各中學同學們的同鄉會，也能抽出他們一部份或全部份的交誼費，作為捐款，那末道種力量一定很大，意義也很深遠。</p>
<p>東吳大閩南同學會敬上</p>

<h3>紗花　日閣總辭多頭氣餒　雙馬紗又告跌停板　一般的觀察將進二千元關</h3>
<p>紗市轉趨下降、局勢帶疲、此因日閣總辭職、國際局勢恐生變化、加之美棉慘落、足使多頭心氣暗澹、檯面帶鬆、市盤乃回下、不過此番自一千七百五十元、直綫奔騰至二千二百二十八元、狂漲四百七十八元之巨、目下回風可跌去一半、的計二百三十九元、或者可見二千元關內亦不足為奇也、至於現紗交易、沉寂如常、所以雜牌紗價頗餒、較雙馬廠單大廉也、二十支雙馬市價為二千一百五十四元、低價為二千〇八十三元、午後開盤、因賣者叢集、市盤即告跌停板、為二千〇八十元、塲外始做二千〇七十元、後為二千〇八十一二元之譜、午後取行所紗大落二三十元、布疲三角至九角半、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因報載日閣更動、人心突見軟化、即落四十元、首盤為二千一百四十五元、因盈利人扒補，少頃回升至二千一百五十五元、嗣後賣者踴躍、即落至二千一百元、然搶風頭之戶復進、又告回昂至二千一百三十五元、但取行所價不佳、又帶義弱、迨至收盤時、回挫至二千〇九十三元收盤、查半日間成交統計一萬五千包、仍以同行皮球交易云、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况急降直下蓋以日閣改組、國際局勢變幻莫測、紗市遭此意外打擊、浮多惶惶不安、晨開美棉爆跌七十至八十磅音、隔夜尖銳之尾風、為之减退、故廠單開盤即降、雖中途一度略回、終又造成跌停板之局面、乃期紗脚地較現貨為穩、晨開近期為一九一〇、十一月期為一九二五、十二月為一九六五、一度以取引所與廠單稍振、略回五至十餘元、終因散多與空方之脫手、午收已低落三五十元、午後因現貨降落停板、人心不定、第有力者逢低吸進遠期拉定、結果近期為一八五〇元收市、軋跌七十三元、十一月期為一八九二元、僅跌落五三元、十二月期為一九五〇元、祇小四三元、故觀其走勢、全為國際形勢所打擊、而浮多出籠與投機之壟斷、若形勢一朝轉緩、其反動之烈、從事者允宜注意、茲列表於後、</p>
<h3>印越棉同時到滬　棉價過高交易轉談</h3>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、考近來各方對於外棉之直接訂購、雖因目下上海存底稀少、及機會甚佳、而購意較屬踴躍、但外匯申請不易核准、故僅除少數廠方、持有外幣、存於外商銀行同時可能作為抵購外棉之用途、方始作小額、一三百包美棉或巴西棉之定購、其餘若無肯定之應付款項、徒喚奈何、至於現棉情况、則依然堅定、雖廠胃不起、而賣方扳價過高、以致成交略少、但連日各同業間成交之巴西棉、為冊二支原料者、棧交價格皆超出八百元以上也、</p>
<p>又訊、近來火機棉之售價、初起頗因粗絨原料之上昇、而挺進甚力、但二三日來、又因廠方需用不廣、及本市棧存頗敷應用、而市况略跌、昨今二日、同業間做開之棧交價格、皆在四百七十元左右也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、市况因有歐洲戰事不利、及遠東局勢再趨緊張而跌、大量多頭了結及倒限價售出、均頗猛烈、連日華爾街股票旣屬頻頻低落、棉市收盤價格、較之上日乃暴跌七十二三磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因投機者買進及空頭抵補而漲、但續後叉因棉商套賣略跌、最後市况、再因同業買進及歐洲出口商羅致而漲、昨日收盤價格、各漲七八羅比左右、</p>
<p>又預測今日開盤市况、因國外消息惡劣、及學棉猛瀉而看跌十羅比左右、</p>

<p>外滙昨日市况、中央與滙豐兩掛牌、仍懸原價、滙豐等小櫃檯英美滙價均平、英美滙黑黑市交易轉寂、而市勞仍穩中帶鬆、進口洋行裹足不前、而華商私人頭寸暗中仍有兜售、晨開後初喊美金三元六二五賣出、至十點後三元七五仍無買戶、下午三元八七五為難結難賣價、較上日略硬、英滙二辦士二五、仍有進者、與上日收價同、始終未聞成交、</p>
<h3>證券　倒閣風聲　牽動證券　內債外股同樣跌</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市因日美關係惡化而日本倒閣、上海各種市塲、均略受影響、公債關係允鉅、人心愈虛、加以「川幫」又有賣出、丙種又敲破七十元見六十九元二角低價、幸補空尙稱熱鬧、得以維持不墜、但脚地已見鬆軟，環境前途變化正多、殊不可以常理測也、昨日上午、同康新華信孚買進丙種以七十元零二角開盤、再高至零四角、後以鴻大寳降賣出為濃、七十元關遂告敲破、見九元六角低價、午收即小三五角、午後形勢仍係供過於求、聯和生大九成不斷賣出、幸協興元及同康補空亦甚熱鬧、中字亦有吃胃、小價見九元二角、以一三角半收盤、總計結果、一致跌落六七角至力角半、成交約一百七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新亞藥廠股二百股、每股價為五十元〇五角、</p>
<p>衆業股市因日閣辭職、突告銳落、在可怖賣風中、一般浮戶多頭俱作不限價之斬結、加之週末在邇、局勢演變、難以逆料、買方咸具戒心、故價格一回即跌、卒以近低價之水準收盤、</p>

<h3>洋粉新囤奮起　市面欲平又漲</h3>
<p>洋粉北幫實銷已見懈怠、市面原可逐步回平、惟因日美惡化、或虞運途被阻、後到不繼、乃又引起新囤大戶之奮起吸收、而浮戶散客亦趁機收買、惟獲利者亦有吐出、故市價在上漲中漲風尙見平綏、蓋其盤旋步砌也、售開福壽牌四十元零三角、財神三十九元半、砲臺早市四十一元四五角、下午四十一元六七角、金龍西棧早市三十九元半至四十元、下午自三十九元九角半至四十元零一三角、均比前市漲六七角、成交四萬包、麩皮有獲利回出小包漲至四十二元六角回至四十一元半、晚收四十二元、小麥進出兩乏、人心依然望好、</p>
<h3>油市　賣氣消沉中　油儈依然硬抬　結果反升一二元</h3>
<p>食油實銷昨仍呆滯未暢、晨初開市買氣消沉、散戶頗多貶價求售、故行情曾見下落三五元、嗣因多方逢低又來拉抬、致後市重趨回昂、結果大致比前反升一二元、統市售開靑島生油二十桶、大連豆油二百桶、大有廠淸油四百擔又菜油三百擔、塗料廠菜油三百擔、日華廠菜油一百桶、立德廠菜油五百擔、</p>

<h3>悼羅文幹先生</h3>
<p>— 平野</p>
<p>羅文幹鈞任先生外交耆碩法學深邃，服官講學，傾動南北，頃讀電訊，驚悉先生逝於部關，深為痛悼。</p>
<p>先生淸康自矢，剛正不阿，民初袁氏　帝，氏執法北平，以袁背叛民國，立簽拘票，格於環境，　被出都，此種剛直　毅之精神，應永為國人欽敬。北伐成功後，氏先後任司法行政部長暨外交部長，在外長任內，時東省變故多端，羅文峪一隅爭執允甚，適羅氏乃弟遺書先生，請為位置，先生向不願任用私人，雖在弟昆，亦不絲毫變通，當立揮復函，中有「羅文峪事件，舉國關心，從公不遑，何能及私，」等語，終其身，羅氏未因個人之顯達，而為其弟謀，其廓然至公，可以概見。</p>
<p>氏身任外長，終年衣一長袍，或有詢以何不易以西裝，氏笑答曰，予早歲留學英倫牛津，後走法比各國，自視國亦濁世佳公子，今則巳由絢爛而歸平淡矣，氏好飮酒，辦公室中，案牘盈尺外，惟紹酒瓶與雪茄相伴，常飮至兩目紅腫如胡桃，未肯稍抑其酒興，豪情俠腸，至老不衰。氏迭任要職，從不妄用公家分文，氏家本富有，以氏從政故，恒移家產以補廉俸之不足，昔年嘗與筆者言，謂非相知有素者，誰將信予之身任要職，而猶不免益以私產過其生涯耶，相與一笑。後氏講學西南，未獲悉其近况，悵念無巳，遽聞溘逝，用述其平時言行如此。</p>
<p>微文揭曉之四</p>
<h3>小掱手</h3>
<p>— 尤作迅</p>
<p>我得了一個敎訓</p>
<p>戰前的長江輪船是極其目由的，旣無登記之手續，更沒搜查等等的麻煩。因此，除却眞正的搭客外，還多一批專事竊取「出門人」財物的小偷掱手之類的歹人。</p>
<p>我從漢口回上海來，乘的一艘太古公司客船，向東急流的江水，將船身推得飛一般的快。　是一個早晨，太陽給水面鍍上了一　黃金，微風掀起的輕波，一閃一閃的光芒。兩岸農家的烟自裏灣灣曲曲的冒着靑烟。我站在甲板上眺望遠處山腰裏初昇的旭日。「引擎」的隆隆聲控制着這幽靜的晨曦。</p>
<p>忽然，船艙裏起了一陣騷動。我急忙奔向出事地點。是一偶十三四歲的小掱手，竊取旅客箱子裹的東西被捉住了，像抓小鷄般的扯住要打，旁　的人勸着，說這孩子太小，打不得。喧囂間，二副」來了，他認得這小掱手，因為前此數月，也曾發生過同株的事，總因他的年齡太小而饒恕了。這决可不肯就這樣放他過去。要想個方法儆誡儆誡他，於是，幾個茶房將小掱手用索子懸進空着的貨會裏。但那小掱手却面不改色，若無其事的聽他們擺佈。隔不久，倉底送來了一陣小調聲「姐兒呀，房中呀……。這却粉碎了「二副」先生的儆誡計劃。</p>
<p>「　機一動，計上心來」，「二副」去點亮了一盞馬燈」，用鉛絲繫了宕下倉去。這一來，小掱手可急叫了，嘶聲的求救，燈光照見他那副乞憐的臉，兩行淚水不住的淌着。</p>
<p>這是因為從未透進過陽光的貨倉裹，早成了耗子，蜈蚣，蜥蜴，毒虫的世界。小掱手雖置身於這樣的險境中，非不害怕，實為四週的黑暗給遮蔽了一切，他怕什麽呢？燈來了，打破了幽閣，照透每一角落。他開始看見毒虫在爬動了，近啦！沂啦！於是，狂呼怪叫，希望立即脫險。</p>
<p>這是一個好教訓。</p>
<p>置身於佈滿了毒虫的險境中的人，非其不知厲害，不思自拔，　因四週的黑暗為他蒙蔽一切。若投以一緩之光，使其瞥見可怖之情况，則必力圖掙扎了。</p>

<p>三，金魚不會傳染肺癆，即使以大量的肺癆菌飼養它們，它們也不會染得。</p>

<h3>戰地X光機</h3>
<p>— 永運</p>
<p>携帶最便的X光機器，要算專供戰地用的一種了。現在美國軍中皆巳具備。只要十分鍾就可將它裝置完畢，檢騐一個兵士僅須時一分鐘，它的主要用途即爲诊断傷兵體內槍彈，碎砲壳的位置，因戰地醫院設備簡單，無有X光機器也。更重要的即此種X光機無須冲晒軟片，一照即可查見子彈在處。自然要拍照也是可以的。軍隊中担架即可做手術臺，可直接將担架放於框架上，檢騐畢立即移開，對於傷兵方便之極，毫無麻煩。（編者按：請參看本刊九月二十日克君一文）</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十三　流浪到上海</p>
<p>沿途因為軍隊已在動員的緣故，火車汽車都擠得了不得，他們這一個小團體中，除了林生一個年輕小伙子以外，兩個是女人，一個是未老先衰的中年人，行李却又帶得小少，因此一路眞是非常的困苦，才到徐州，秋海棠便第一個病倒了。</p>
<p>「大哥，大嫂，看來祇能請你們先走了！」梅寳因為父親病了四五天還不見好，林生夫妻兩個伴着他們，已經顯出很焦急的神氣；再看報上的消息，上海的戰事也發動了，便不願使他們再耽待，這一天就自動的催促他們。「此刻咱們的軍隊聽說仕上海打得很好，你們湊早先上南京去吧！祇要爸爸一好，咱們就跟上來找你們。」</p>
<p>林生皺着眉頭，並不就回答。一「好，旣然妹妹這樣說，咱們就祇能先走一步了。」孟大嫂漲紅着一張肥臉說：「不是我等不及，實在是怕家裹的爸媽要盼得心焦，我想公公的信他們一定已收到了，咱們再不去，兩位老人家的心裏是不安的。妹妹，那末咱們在南京再見吧……！」</p>
<p>秋海棠和梅寳的心裏也實在不願再牽累他們，便讓林生先自結淸旅館裏的帳目走了。</p>
<p>孟家小兩口子動身以後，總算秋海棠的運氣還小十分壞，祇在床上繼續躺了三天，病便去了十之八九。（二三九）</p>

<h3>Key Leader of Japanese Extremists, Hideki Tojo, Ordered to Form Cabinet</h3>
<p>Known for Endorsing Tanaka's Policy of Aggression, Future Actions Attract Widespread Attention</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (United Press) - The Japanese Emperor today, in the afternoon, ordered Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, the Minister of War of the Third Konoe Cabinet, to form a new cabinet. Before ordering Tojo to form a new cabinet, the Emperor consulted with Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido and senior statesmen to select a leader for the new cabinet.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Reuters) - Tojo, who served as Minister of War in both the Second and Third Konoe Cabinets, has been ordered to form a new cabinet. Previously, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal Kido held a meeting with senior statesmen, including Privy Council President Hara Yoshimichi, former Prime Ministers Baron Wakatsuki Reijiro, Hirota Koki, Admiral Okada Keisuke, General Hayashi Senjuro, General Abe Nobuyuki, and General Yonai Mitsumasa. Following the meeting, they recommended Tojo to the Emperor for the position of Prime Minister. Tojo was summoned to the palace at 4:35 PM and received the order to form a cabinet. After leaving the palace, former Navy Minister Oikawa was immediately summoned to the palace in succession. It is said that the Emperor personally informed Oikawa about the appointment of Tojo to form a cabinet. This kind of action is not unprecedented. When Admiral Yonai was appointed Prime Minister on January 16, 1940, the Emperor also personally summoned General Hata Shunroku to the palace. Tojo was born in 1884 into a military family. He graduated from the Army Staff College in 1915. In 1919, he served as a military attaché in Germany. In 1922, he was an instructor at the Staff College. In 1934, he was the commander of the 24th Brigade. In 1935, he was the commander of the Kempeitai. In 1937, he was the chief of staff of the Kwantung Army. Later, he was transferred to the post of Director of Army Aviation. In July 1940, he was appointed Minister of War in the Second Konoe Cabinet.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters) - Reuters' Far East expert stated that Lieutenant General Tojo, who was ordered to form a cabinet today, has long been regarded as one of the most ardent leaders of Japanese imperialist aggressors. Since the cabinet of General Tanaka in 1928, Tojo is the first army general to become prime minister, with the exception of General Abe, who briefly served as prime minister in the autumn of 1939. Judging from Tojo's experience, it can be said that he fully agrees with the Tanaka Memorial. Tojo is upright and honest, with an extremely loyal attitude, but he is one of the main leaders of the extremists. This order to form a cabinet proves the general opinion regarding Konoe's resignation, that extremism has now triumphed. As for whether this will lead to action and in which direction it will develop, these are all separate questions.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Reuters) - It is generally expected here that the new cabinet will be clearly under military influence, but there is no reliable information about the possible candidates for the new cabinet.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Reuters) - The fact that former Navy Minister Oikawa was summoned to the palace after Tojo has aroused speculation among some people here. It is generally believed that it is related to guaranteeing the Navy's support for the Army's cabinet.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (United Press) - The Domei News Agency, the official Japanese news agency, said that well-informed Japanese sources believe today that the new cabinet will not adopt any drastic new policies, but will concentrate on promoting the basic policies of the Japanese Empire with greater determination. They said that they expect the new cabinet to achieve complete unity on national policy, as the collapse of the Third Konoe Cabinet was due to a lack of unity. They pointed out that Japan's fixed policies are to resolve the China Incident, build a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and adhere to the spirit of the Anti-Comintern Pact. They further emphasized that the new cabinet will strive to achieve Japan's main goals, namely, not only to maintain peace in East Asia, but also to maintain peace throughout the world. At the same time, former Minister of War Tojo has established a headquarters in the Ministry of War and is actively working to form a new cabinet in accordance with the Emperor's order.</p>
<p>Japan Leans Again Towards Axis Powers, Flames of War Spread Across the Pacific</p>
<p>Washington, 17th (United Press) - Well-informed circles believed yesterday that the general resignation of the Konoe Cabinet was a victory for pro-Axis elements in Japan. At the same time, it was reported here that Konoe tied the future of his government to negotiations with the United States. Therefore, Konoe's resignation may indicate that the talks have been unsuccessful. Well-informed circles said that if the new Japanese cabinet is composed of military personnel and neo-Nazis, it will indicate that Japan is prepared to launch hostilities against the Soviet Union, taking advantage of the latter's struggle against Germany on its western border. Well-informed circles said that they were well aware that during the two months of US-Japan negotiations, the Japanese resolutely refused to consider withdrawing from the German-Italian-Japanese Axis, believing that this would not hinder understanding with the United States. Informed sources are closely watching the selection of the Foreign Minister, as the failure of the US-Japan talks was due to Japan's inability to resolve the dispute between the domestic hawks and the liberals, and American diplomats did not know which group in Japan to consult in order to obtain a guarantee that Japan would abide by the agreement.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters) - This morning, British newspapers did not ignore the Japanese cabinet crisis due to the severe situation in Moscow. The Times editorial said that Tojo's appointment can be regarded as the harbinger of Japan's return to the Axis and the virtual termination of talks with Washington. The German advance towards Moscow and the Don River must have induced the extremists to believe that the time has come to advance further, which is why the Konoe Cabinet collapsed. Informed sources here predict that the new Japanese government led by Tojo may either attack the north or advance south, which may lead to the flames of war in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Singapore, 17th (Reuters) - Responsible officials here are not prepared to express any opinions on the great significance of the Japanese cabinet crisis, but they cannot help but recall that the Japanese army entered Vietnam less than a week after the previous Konoe cabinet resigned three months ago. Qualified observers believe that regardless of the outcome of this cabinet crisis, there are now clear signs that Japan's radical patriots are prepared to place the nation's fate in the hands of Nazi extremists. Their patience has been exhausted by the progress of the Washington talks, and their usual alarmist words may have frightened the Japanese into believing that even a sacrificial war is better than revolution. Singapore Radio commented on the Japanese cabinet crisis tonight, saying that the Japanese are prepared to attack the Soviet Union in the north or Thailand in the south, or even advance on both sides at the same time. Tension in the Far East has never been closer to the breaking point. What will follow Japan's future actions is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Rise of Radical Faction of Japanese Military, May Start War with Soviet Union</p>
<p>Singapore, 17th (Reuters) - The news of the Japanese cabinet's resignation was not considered surprising here. For several weeks, there have been clear signs that the radical faction of the Japanese military was becoming increasingly restless and wanted to stage a coup to restore its prestige. At the same time, non-military elements also wanted to seize some real power from the military after the military temporarily lost its prestige. The Konoe Cabinet was composed of both military and civilian factions, and tried hard to delay the situation with the possibility of a settlement with the United States. Now that the delay has been long, and the much-touted settlement with the United States has not materialized under conditions acceptable to the Konoe Cabinet, it is even more difficult for the Konoe Cabinet to maintain its position. In the past week, it would be more accurate to say that it was not that the Konoe Cabinet was about to resign, but rather that the cabinet could not confront the military. Therefore, the general feeling is that there is nothing that can be avoided. This resignation of the cabinet is a real decision as to who is in the dominant position, which is very different from the previous cabinet resignations. The atmosphere in Japan is extremely tense and cannot tolerate further hesitation. The fact that the Japanese cabinet crisis broke out as German troops approached the outskirts of Moscow shows that the military demanded that troops be stationed in the Soviet Union when Moscow fell, while the non-military faction was not prepared to agree. Informed sources here predict that there will be much discussion before the new cabinet is formed. At that time, it will be clearly indicated whether the military clique will seize power or whether the civilian faction can reduce and eliminate the power of the military clique as it had intended. The position of the Emperor, which is still highly valued in Japan, is currently ambiguous. Some time ago, it was generally felt that the Emperor also wanted to restrain the military clique, so there was an organization of the National General Headquarters in the hope of curbing extremist elements. However, it is said that the army has since strongly advised the Emperor. What can be predicted at present depends on the discussions that will be held in Tokyo in the next few days or perhaps ten hours, which will determine not only the future of the Japanese military clique in its own country, but also the entire issue of Japan's dispatch of troops to attack the Soviet Union and war and peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>Far Eastern Red Army Has Strong Strength, Japan Will Suffer a Severe Blow if It Invades the North</p>
<p>London, 16th (Havas) - According to Soviet sources here, no matter what happens in the Far East after the Japanese cabinet change, the Red Army in Siberia has sufficient strength to cope with it easily. The reserve troops from the eastern part of the Soviet Union who are going to the Western Front are all newly enlisted soldiers and do not weaken the original strength of the garrison in Siberia. In short, the Red Army in Siberia is well-equipped and engaged in mechanized warfare, which is superior to the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>White House Holds Special Meeting to Discuss How to Deal with the Far East Crisis, Important Military and Political Leaders Attend</h3>
<p>Washington, 17th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt suddenly convened a special meeting yesterday, attended by Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of War Stimson, Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Navy Chief of Staff Stark, and presidential personal representative Hopkins, who had gone to Europe for inspection, to discuss the Far East situation and the Lend-Lease Act. The meeting lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. After the meeting, Hull told reporters that he was ordered not to make any comments and that he did not know whether the White House would issue a statement. When reporters asked if there would be another meeting, Hull replied that there should be another meeting soon. Other attendees were also ordered not to make any comments.</p>
<h3>East Daily Continues to Attack the United States</h3>
<p>Wakasugi Revisits Welles, No Progress in US-Japan Talks</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Reuters) - The Asahi Shimbun, the mouthpiece of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, today published an article attacking the United States' Far East policy, saying that Japan's efforts to improve US-Japan relations are merely one-sided goodwill. The article first described the US's meddling in Far Eastern affairs, the most egregious of which is aiding Chongqing, so that Chongqing is now using American weapons, American bullets, and American technology to confront Japan. The United States is also providing Chongqing with military and financial planning. It then said that if the American people could compare the two sides, they would know that Japan has legitimate reasons to complain and that it is justified in implementing its self-defense plans. The Japanese people will still insist that the United States drastically change its policy and first stop being a partner in Chongqing's war.</p>
<p>Washington, 17th (Havas) - Wakasugi, an advisor to the Japanese Embassy in the United States, met with Under Secretary of State Welles today for discussions, which lasted for forty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - Ishii, a spokesperson for the Japanese government, said yesterday that he does not believe that the US-Japan talks in Washington have made any progress, but the talks have not been suspended and are still continuing. The Domei News Agency protested yesterday against the United States' delaying tactics, which can represent the attitude of most people in Japan. It is still unknown whether Wakasugi has met with US Under Secretary of State Welles.</p>
<h3>Far East Situation Becoming Serious, Observations of Grady</h3>
<p>San Francisco, 17th (Reuters) - Roosevelt's Far East economic investigator, Grady, recently returned here from the Far East. According to him, the resignation of the Japanese cabinet has created a very dangerous situation. He believes that the next Japanese cabinet will be strictly militaristic, and it should be known that any cabinet with a special tendency is always dangerous. Grady also said that when he visited the Dutch East Indies, the Dutch East Indies government showed him everything and that they were fully prepared for any emergency.</p>
<h3>American Merchant Ships Ordered to Withdraw from Coastal Waters of China and Japan, American Warship Torpedoed Near Iceland</h3>
<p>Washington, 17th (Reuters Urgent) - Responsible authorities stated that all American merchant ships have now been ordered to withdraw from Chinese and Japanese territorial waters due to what the Navy calls the "Pacific situation."</p>
<p>Manila, 17th (Reuters) - According to unconfirmed rumors, all American ships sailing in the Pacific have been ordered to immediately sail to the nearest British or American port. Senior naval officers did not comment on this rumor, but according to a leader in the shipping industry, the Panama cargo ship "Pili Reida" of the US Maritime Commission has been ordered by the Navy to return to Manila.</p>
<p>Washington, 17th (Reuters Urgent)</p>
<p>According to an official announcement, the US destroyer "Kearny" was hit by a torpedo this morning 350 miles southwest of Iceland, in the same area as the US warship "Greer" that was attacked last time. The "Kearny" is one of the latest American destroyers, built just last year, with a displacement of 1,630 tons and equipped with five-inch guns. The captain is Colonel Tai Dennis. The ship has only two funnels, which is clearly different from the four funnels of the destroyers transferred to the United Kingdom. According to naval officers, this point reduces the possibility of being mistaken for a British ship. The US Navy Department has not yet received reports mentioning casualties. Although the ship was damaged, it is still able to proceed on its own power.</p>
<h3>Brief Biography of Tojo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (United Press) - Lieutenant General Hideki Tojo, known for his mental acuity and seemingly inclined towards moderate nationalism rather than extremism, has been ordered to form a cabinet. Tojo's proposal to simultaneously confront the Soviet Union and China is only a matter of time. Tojo served as Minister of War in both the second and third Konoe cabinets and is one of the most famous figures in the Japanese army. The fact that Japanese officers all call him Kamisori, meaning "razor," shows what kind of person he is. "Razor" is a Japanese metaphor for someone who is mentally sharp. Tojo's temperament is entirely inherited from his father. The saying "like father, like son" is truly not false. Tojo's father was a great military strategist who assisted General Kawakami in planning military affairs during the Russo-Japanese War from 1904 to 1905. This Minister of War, who resigned yesterday, became a national hero after delivering a sensational speech in 1939. In 1939, he was the Vice Minister of War in the Hiranuma Cabinet. At that time, there was a Japanese munitions manufacturers association, and Tojo attended the meeting and delivered a speech, arguing that Japan must simultaneously fight on the front lines and in China and predicted that Japan would win. In August 1939, the position of the Hiranuma Cabinet was shaken when Germany and the Soviet Union concluded a non-aggression pact after Japan refused to conclude a military alliance with the Axis powers, and it finally resigned. At that time, Tojo served as the Director of the Army Aviation Department and the Commander-in-Chief of Military Aviation. From then on, Tojo's resignation was directly related to his position as Minister of War. Later, Yamada, the successor in military training, recommended him to Konoe as the Minister of War. Tojo graduated from the military academy in 1915. In 1919, he went to Germany to serve as a military attaché and study, learning about the general situation in Europe at that time. After returning to China in 1922, he served as a professor at the military academy. In addition to being the Minister of War, he held various positions in the Ministry of War. Tojo worked hard to expand and transform the Japanese army aviation. After becoming the Minister of War, he told the press, "I know nothing about politics. If you ask me about aviation affairs, I can tell you everything, Yomiuri Shimbun." Tojo has no hobbies other than drinking. Once he starts drinking, he can drink for two or three days without stopping. "Hochi Shimbun" said that Tojo is a teetotaler. The newspaper said that according to Tojo's wife, her husband only drinks one or two glasses of beer when drinking. Tojo's wife also described her husband's daily life, saying, "He gets up very early every day, and his only hobby is reading biographies of world greats. Sometimes I even see him reading economic books. My husband and I have three sons and three daughters, and he never interferes with their aspirations. He is very kind to the weak and never scolds servants. He eats very little at each meal, but he is very healthy." General Tojo was born in December 1884. His hometown is Iwate Prefecture in northern Japan.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Support China with All Their Strength, Solving Various Economic Problems</h3>
<p>Sir Niemeyer Receives Representatives of Chongqing Press, Governments of Two Democratic Countries Fully Cooperate Sincerely</p>
<p>Chongqing - When Sir Niemeyer, the head of the British economic delegation, received representatives of Chinese and foreign newspapers here for the first time today, he said, "I have come here to seek everything and have no preconceived ideas. Therefore, I cannot currently comment on China's financial and economic situation. The purpose of this trip is to consult with the Chinese authorities to find out the characteristics of China's situation and to use the knowledge and experience I have gained in my work in other countries to help China solve various problems. You should know that I was ordered to come here from another part of the world, and my country is currently engaged in a bitter struggle in that part and has its own financial and economic problems. The United Kingdom is extremely sincere and willing to do its best to contribute to the maintenance and development of China's economy." At that time, Cochran, a representative of the US Department of the Treasury, was also present. According to Cochran, Sir Niemeyer has spoken in detail about the purpose of his visit, and there is no need to repeat it. His stay in China may not be as long as that of Sir Niemeyer, but the US government already has several economists in Chongqing, including Coes, a member of the Exchange Stabilization Fund. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Sir Niemeyer, head of the British financial and economic delegation, and Mr. Cochran, a special commissioner of the US Department of the Treasury, received Chinese and foreign journalists in the accompanying capital at 11:00 am on the 17th and issued talks to explain the mission of the delegation. Mr. Niemeyer first said, "We have just come to China, and everything</p>
<p>is yet to be studied</p>
<p>, so there are no preconceived ideas. We hope to provide the experience we have gained in Europe and other places to help solve China's problems. We will first discuss specific issues with the Chinese authorities. I was sent to China from the other side of the world when my country was engaged in a major war and had its own difficulties, which is sufficient to show the United Kingdom's</p>
<p>sincere sympathy</p>
<p>for China. We hope to do our best to contribute to China's economy in order to achieve the purpose of solving specific problems. Mr. Cochran and I are here in accordance with the British and American policy of supporting China." Mr. Niemeyer continued, "The Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund is only one aspect of the exchange rate problem." Mr. Niemeyer repeatedly stated that providing our opinions as much as possible to solve these problems is</p>
<p>the sole purpose</p>
<p>of our coming to China. I am very pleased that Mr. Cochran can come with me, which is sufficient to show the determination of the governments of China, Britain, and the United States to fully cooperate and resolve difficult issues, and these problems can only be solved through cooperative efforts. Cochran is an expert assistant to US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Mr. Cochran told reporters that he was sent to China and worked with Sir Niemeyer, which was</p>
<p>very gratifying</p>
<p>. Sir Niemeyer and I have jointly engaged in various affairs in Europe and the United States. Mr. Cochran also said that Sir Niemeyer personally saw the US government promoting the policy of assisting democratic countries when he was in Washington. Mr. Cochran said that my stay in China will not be as long as that of Sir Niemeyer, but Committee member Forks and Taylor of the Exchange Stabilization Fund are still here. Mr. Forks and others have obtained</p>
<p>a large amount of cooperation</p>
<p>from the Chinese side. We are willing to do our best to help China. " Mr. Cochran also came to China for the first time. He said that the delegation was warmly received by China, and it is expected that the stay in Chongqing will be very pleasant. Mr. Niemeyer also said that he was very pleased to have Baxter to assist him. Mr. Baxter was formerly a financial advisor to Thailand and is currently a financial advisor to Myanmar. Sir Niemeyer</p>
<p>highly praised</p>
<p>Mr. Baxter and said that Mr. Baxter's arrival is sufficient to show the cooperation between the two neighboring countries of China and Myanmar. The working time of the delegation will mostly be in Chongqing, but the exact length of stay in China is not yet determined. When a reporter asked Sir Niemeyer for his opinion on the Japanese cabinet crisis, Mr. Niemeyer declined to answer, but said that this should not</p>
<p>surprise</p>
<p>us very much. Later, when asked about his observations on China's economic situation, Mr. Niemeyer said that the situation is changing very quickly, and I am ashamed that I do not know much, which is why I came to China. What is admirable is that China has experienced difficult times for many years, but the economic situation is not as difficult as imagined. Mr. Niemeyer remained silent on the question of what is the best way to maintain China's currency value, but he spoke a lot about the Exchange Stabilization Fund. He said that the Exchange Stabilization Fund has not been</p>
<p>implemented for long</p>
<p>, and the US freezing of funds is also a recent matter, but these are all tools to support China. The balance of the Exchange Stabilization Fund is still sufficient, but we cannot expect immediate results. When asked about his impression of Chongqing, Mr. Niemeyer replied that he had visited the city many times and learned about Chongqing's past experiences, but the material damage was not very serious, which was surprising.</p>
<p>"Rebuild as soon as it is bombed"</p>
<p>is a description of Sir Niemeyer's visit to the bombed area of Chongqing. Mr. Niemeyer's impression of the citizens of Chongqing is that the people he met were all happy. Regarding the effectiveness of the bombing, Mr. Niemeyer said that the destructive power of the bombing was not as great as we had imagined before experiencing it. (17th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Brooke Popham Warns Japan: Ready to Accept the Challenge</h3>
<p>Far East Allied Forces' Position is Now Different from the Past, Recognizes the Great Significance of Japan's Expanding Aviation Routes</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th: British newspapers report the words of General Brooke Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East, from Melbourne, stating that in recent months, the military and political position of the Allies in the Far East has greatly improved, and the possibility of being attacked has greatly decreased. We do not want to fight Japan, but if Japan insists on a war, then we are ready to deal with it. War equipment is now being transported eastward continuously. The expansion of Japanese aviation routes to Timor Island is of great significance, but if the British side pays close attention, it is not a cause for concern. If we do nothing, Japan will continue to invade, but if we make them understand that we are now awake, then the situation will not develop. Australia is now supplying the equipment needed by the British forces in the East. Anything needed must first be sought from Australia. Brooke Popham has held a meeting with the Australian War Cabinet to discuss maintaining and strengthening the solid defense links from India through northern Australia to New Zealand. Non-Labor Party members of the War Advisory Council also attended the meeting. Representatives of the New Zealand government will participate in the talks next week, and then Brooke Popham will tour New Zealand for staff talks. After returning to Singapore, he will also travel to India within the year. One of the purposes of Brooke Popham's trip is to supply the air force concentrated in Singapore with Beaufort bombers made in Australia.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Factors Hindering Price Stability</h3>
<p>Since the recent surge in prices, those with capital have believed that the legal currency will be impossible to manage, and they only know how to hoard and speculate, regardless of the quality of the goods. Speculators believe that the opportunity is not to be missed, and the futures market is turbulent, with prices soaring. As a result, all essential commodities for life, such as rice, coal, oil, flour, clothing, and rent, have all raised their prices. Public opinion is focused on how to curb the malignant inflation of prices and maintain the public's right to life. The Director-General of the Municipal Council has formally stated that he will take appropriate measures to adjust the situation and seek to establish an organization to manage retail prices, and will soon issue an important announcement. Therefore, I do not want to comment on it for now, but I hope that it will be implemented as soon as possible in this increasingly urgent Far East situation.</p>
<p>It is important to know that today's prices are driven by various factors. If the production and trade of goods were not blockaded and controlled, and they could still circulate freely, domestic goods would definitely not be so expensive. Shanghai has always been a port for the concentration of foreign goods and the region with the largest consumption. However, as the European war intensifies, the supply of foreign goods is becoming increasingly scarce, while the general consumption remains unchanged. The gap between supply and demand is widening, and the trend of hoarding is deepening, resulting in unbelievably high prices, which is also something that cannot be helped. However, while this is a reason for the rise in prices, it cannot be said that today's extraordinary prices are entirely due to this reason. The futures market has indeed contributed to the rise in prices. Since the outbreak of the war, there have only been spot transactions, so although there have been ups and downs, they have been somewhat constrained and the changes have been slow. Since the creation of futures, cotton yarn and cotton cloth have futures, oil cakes have futures, US dollars have futures, and even sugar has futures. With a small amount of margin money, large-scale transactions are made, and speculative elements who gamble to win money are like tigers with wings, and they cannot be contained once they start. As a result, futures drive spot prices, causing the prices of spot goods to rise continuously. Even the value of the currency seen today is due to speculators manipulating prices to an infinitely large extent, which reflects the currency value to an infinitely small extent. Is this just an illusion, or should it be regarded as a reality?</p>
<p>Some say that this is not the case. Regardless of the purchasing power of the currency, what represents the currency value is the foreign exchange rate! What is the current exchange rate of the legal currency against foreign currencies? If you still think that this is not the fault of the legal currency itself, who will believe it? Indeed, I do not want to talk about the central government's quoted price. Even the gradual decline of the exchange rate in the past black market was a kind of passive resistance to protect the legal currency. Otherwise, if the legal exchange rate were still maintained, would the legal currency still have its current position? Even the work of today's Exchange Stabilization Fund is for the sake of protecting the legal currency. This has long been implemented in various countries in the East and West, but China is only now learning to walk. Still, there are frequent attacks from internal and external troubles. The people of the country do not know how to support it, but instead destroy it. Exported foreign exchange should be settled according to regulations, but it is not settled. Imports of non-essential goods can be saved, but they are not saved. The black market should not be allowed to occur, but it is still heard of every day. Capital has nowhere to be used, so it escapes. It insists on using goods and foreign currency as a protective talisman for concealment, creating an endless high price. It does not realize that the repeatedly raised prices actually reduce the effectiveness of its capital. It clings to this and does not understand, still thinking that it has succeeded. Its stupidity is truly unmatched. As for those who fail due to speculation, it goes without saying. Therefore, if the public wants the legal currency to become waste paper, then so be it. Otherwise, they can only support national policies and cooperate with the Exchange Stabilization Fund to achieve fulfillment without overflowing.</p>
<p>However, the work of the Exchange Stabilization Fund is widely discussed, and people are wondering how it is being carried out. There is no lack of doubt. How much is being supplied, and which industries are being supplied? Based on what we have heard, if tobacco leaves still have foreign exchange that can be supplied, then the nature of necessities that are more important than tobacco leaves, such as food and clothing, is even easier to obtain foreign exchange. Previously, it was heard that a movie theater that only shows foreign films would not be able to continue to operate normally without the supply of foreign exchange. Now, it is still showing movies as usual. If it did not obtain a guarantee of supply, I am afraid it would not be so peaceful. Therefore, the rumors from the outside that the Exchange Stabilization Fund will supply a certain amount of foreign exchange to Shanghai in a certain month, gradually decreasing until it will no longer be supplied in a certain month, are unfounded and unbelievable. The foreign exchange for luxury businesses is still being supplied, so how can the foreign exchange needed for other daily necessities be withheld and not given? It can be concluded that there is no such fact. As for the foreign exchange needed for rice, there is no problem because the Municipal Council has public sales of rice. As for coal, there are rumors from the outside that it is not easy to apply for foreign exchange, although I do not know how true it is. However, how can the coal purchased by coal companies be guaranteed not to flow out? This is the same nature as cotton mills applying to purchase cotton foreign exchange. The only thing that can be said is that the coal used by power companies should be able to obtain a supply of foreign exchange, so electricity bills should be flat. As for the cotton used by spinning mills, it should be handled in the same way, but in today's society where people's hearts are not as they used to be, who can guarantee that the cotton they purchase will not be replaced? Sugar is inherently a luxury item, but its degree is less than that of tobacco leaves. However, Shanghai imports sugar with foreign exchange, and the sugar in Shanghai is then transported away by people. This means that the foreign exchange for sugar in Shanghai will be consumed without end. Who has such a large amount of supply to maintain the consumption of sugar? It can be seen that the difficulty in obtaining approval for foreign exchange applications is also the fault of the merchants themselves, and it drags down the public! If the industrial and commercial sectors can always prioritize national interests and the well-being of the people, and their will is pure, then all difficulties can be solved easily. The foreign exchange that Shanghai should get will not be without a solution, and the prices in Shanghai will not be difficult to stabilize to a considerable extent. However, the Exchange Stabilization Fund should also announce its approval of the foreign exchange supply to Shanghai, or perhaps there are places where it is inconvenient to announce, so as not to shake the market. I think that there is no need to worry about this. Light will drive away ghosts and monsters, and openness will prevent rumors from spreading. Only by being open can the public understand that this is where foreign exchange is supplied, and this is where there is no supply, so that there will be no confusion. Prices will also have standards for comparison. Why keep it secret and not announce it? Is it to create a hidden place for industrial and commercial sectors that obtain foreign exchange to make unexpected fortunes!</p>
<p>What I don't understand is that since the supply of foreign exchange is limited to fourteen banks, then trade between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the Netherlands is all within it. Exported foreign exchange in the four countries and their territories should not be difficult to control. Even the transfer of foreign exchange should be on the list of those not allowed. Today, the black market is still allowed, so that goods that are not allowed to be supplied with foreign exchange can still be moved and used elsewhere. This is like criticizing a wise person, and it cannot be said that there is no intention of knowingly letting it happen! Even if there is a small amount of foreign exchange floating outside, it is not difficult to control under the current situation of American control. However, using US dollars to replace US exchange is used to promote speculation and hoarding, disrupt the market, and raise prices. Why is it not prohibited? Is it because the freezing order leaves room for a workaround?</p>
<p>Random Talks on the European War</p>
<h3>A True Account of the Moscow Air Raid</h3>
<p>On the fourth night, I decided to sleep in the basement of the American Ambassador's residence, and in the evening, I went to visit a friend nearby. The alarm sounded, and I immediately ran out of the room as usual and into the street. The distance between the two houses was always very close, but that night, the more anxious I was to run there before the alarm stopped, the more the street seemed to be endless. I was afraid I was going the wrong way. Later, I finally ran to the Spaba River Building Square, and I finally felt relieved. I rushed past the militia at the gate and entered the basement just before the anti-aircraft guns opened fire.</p>
<p>That night was very quiet. I sat on a hammock in the basement and chatted with Father White. He was an American missionary and had a church in Moscow. That night, he and I were the only two people seeking refuge in the basement! At 2:20, a servant came in and said that the alarm had been lifted. I parted ways with him. I wanted to take a bus, tram, or subway home, but since the air raid began, all vehicles had stopped, and it was already close to curfew time, so I couldn't delay any longer. I knew it was too late to go home before midnight, and I didn't want to risk being detained again, so I went to the British Consulate and called friends who had cars to ask them to take me back. But I was out of luck and had to use a sofa in a French priest's living room as a bed.</p>
<p>At two o'clock, the alarm sounded again, and we ran out again, carefully waiting near the air-raid shelter in the garden. This air raid was not very fierce, and at three o'clock, we returned to the sofa to sleep.</p>
<p>Until now, Moscow has not suffered major damage from the bombing. Although bombs have been dropped on the streets, squares, and apartment buildings, according to official sources, no military targets have been hit.</p>
<p>The more frequent the bombings, the less the fear of bombing. At first, as soon as I heard the alarm, I felt paralyzed all over, but now I can remain calm when I hear the alarm and forget the terror because of emotional excitement. Everyone has also become increasingly accustomed to the blackout and can gradually distinguish the night like a cat. Bombing has become a part of my life.</p>
<p>Most of the main foods have been issued with ration coupons, but the restrictions are very broad. I live in a hotel and don't feel any inconvenience. Before it was bombed, I held several dinner parties in the room. The menu started with caviar and ended with cranberries. Dutch wine, whiskey, brandy, wine, and champagne were all supplied by friends in the foreign delegation. Because they were unwilling to suffer losses, they would rather eat it all.</p>
<p>If someone told me that such a capital city would still have the time to make menus, sell decorations, clothing, and other irrelevant things during the war, I would not believe it. But some people are doing just that. But we will not easily forget the war. Several places in the city have changed. Two wrecks of German planes—a Junkers 88 and a Heinkel—are exhibited in the public square, which are concrete reminders. Soldiers often march in formation on the streets, singing loudly. Sometimes, soldiers are transported by vehicles and wave to the people. They are young and strong, and their faces are happy, which makes people feel sad and unhappy when they see them.</p>
<p>Several days ago, I went to buy flowers and asked an old clerk about the price of flowers, but he ignored me. It turned out that he was staring at the soldiers passing by outside the window, completely forgetting me. My face showed resentment. These people see their brothers, sons, and nephews sacrificed for the ambition of the invaders. Their anger and depression are naturally beyond my comparison as an outsider. (The End)</p>
<h3>Former French Military and Political Figures Imprisoned in Different Places</h3>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 17th: French leader Pétain, at the suggestion of the Political and Judicial Council, has ordered Daladier (former wartime Prime Minister), Blum (Socialist Prime Minister), and Gamellin (former Commander-in-Chief) to be imprisoned in a fortress. Renaud (Prime Minister at the time of the French collapse) and Colonial Minister Mandel will also be imprisoned in a fortified area. Former Air Minister La Chambre and former Armaments Director Jacqueme are still detained in Bourassol.</p>
<h3>Thailand Urges Readiness to Deal with Any Eventuality</h3>
<p>Havas, Bangkok, 10th: The local radio station recently appealed to the people of the country, asking them to sacrifice their personal freedom to protect the country's freedom. It also instructed that after the German army wins in the Soviet Union, there will be heavy developments in the international community. In short, a storm is about to occur in the Far East. Our country must be prepared so that it can deal with any crisis in the future.</p>
<h3>German Forces Massing 20 to 30 Divisions, Attempting a Direct Assault on Moscow; Soviet Morale High, Showing No Signs of Weakening; Every Step Forward by Germans Exacts a Heavy Price</h3>
<p>Reuter's, London, 17th - Reuter's military commentator states that the general accounts in Soviet communiqués are quite reliable. Therefore, the communiqué's acknowledgement of the deteriorating situation on the western front and the breakthrough of German tanks and mechanized infantry in a certain area has caused some anxiety. The Soviets did not disclose the name of the area, but it most likely refers to the Vyazma to Mozhaisk highway, west of Moscow, where the German offensive is the fiercest. It is noteworthy that the German command only claims that the battle is taking place 100 kilometers from Moscow, which proves that the German advance has only reached Mozhaisk, as this place is indeed 100 kilometers from Moscow. Even in modern mechanized warfare, this distance is still considerable, and the shorter the distance, the greater the resistance and obstacles. It is undeniable that the German army, relying on its superior numbers and equipment, is forcing the defenders southwest of Moscow to retreat. However, every inch the Germans advance will come at a greater price. Soviet morale shows no signs of weakening, and they are prepared to make enormous sacrifices, fighting for every house and every street in Moscow. Even if Moscow falls, it will only be one episode in the overall war. The current German offensive seems to be a direct assault on Moscow, but the Germans may gradually attempt to encircle the city to cut off reinforcements and supply lines from the east. The relative quiet on other fronts indicates that the Germans have concentrated all their forces on the attack on Moscow, which is significant as it may indicate the limits of German manpower and resources. The Soviet strength is limitless, and it is backed by a steady stream of supplies from Britain and America. The increasing flow of British and American supplies to the Soviets proves that these two democratic nations trust the unshakable determination of the Soviet people to resist.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th - A strong defensive line is being built around Moscow. The Red Star newspaper states that Moscow must become an impregnable fortress. We will make Moscow indestructible.</p>
<p>Havas World News Agency, Berlin, 16th - A German Foreign Ministry spokesman recently told the press that the German government will issue a communiqué within days to explain the details of the German-Soviet war, particularly the battle for Moscow. When a reporter asked if the German war reports claiming that German troops had reached the outer defenses of Moscow referred to the vanguard, the spokesman replied that German troops had reached the outskirts of the Soviet capital and were engaged in a desperate battle with the Red Army. Although there are no fortresses or reinforced concrete defenses like the Maginot Line, there are still considerable fortifications around the city. Furthermore, the population of Moscow is still large and can be used to build defensive works. Therefore, Moscow cannot be considered an undefended city.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 17th - According to Swedish military observers, the ferocity of the battle for Moscow exceeds all previous battles on the Eastern Front. The left flank of General von Bock's Central Army Group is attempting to encircle Moscow. After capturing Kalinin, they may besiege Moscow along the Kaluga-Orel-Tula line from the north. It is said that no fewer than 20 to 30 German divisions are concentrated there. However, the Moscow railway and highway network is extensive, making it very convenient to mobilize reinforcements, and it is easy to defend. Although the German forces are superior, it may be difficult to capture the city in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Moscow Highway Bordering Lines. Increasingly Fierce Struggle Between Sides</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 17th - A special correspondent for Pravda reported from the Vyazma area that on the 15th and 16th, the fighting was extremely fierce along the highway lines. The enemy attempted to seize key highway points. The enemy used more tanks and motorized units in the battle. They possessed an advantage in numbers, and broke into our defense lines. The Red Army bravely repelled the enemy. Our artillery also used fierce artillery fire to prevent the enemy from advancing. In addition to suffering attacks on the front lines, the enemy was also attacked in the rear by the Red Army. (This is because some Red Army units were cut off from communication by the German advance, and therefore remained behind German lines.) In short, the situation in the Vyazma area remains serious, but after our army took active measures, it has stopped the enemy's advance.</p>
<p>Odessa Still in Soviet Hands; Soviet Government Moves Capital to Kazan</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 17th - Moscow Radio reports that Odessa is still holding out. Soviet forces are currently resisting the advance of German and Romanian troops. The Odessa garrison has crushed a regiment of Romanian cavalry and the 13th and 15th Infantry Divisions in a certain front line.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Washington, 17th - There has been no news here regarding the whereabouts of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt, who was previously in Moscow. Last night, a Reuters reporter learned from the State Department that there have been rumors that Steinhardt will move from Moscow to a location further inland. Another report said that Kazan, a city on the Volga River 400 miles east of Moscow, may become the temporary capital of the Soviet Union, and that important personnel from the U.S. Embassy have already arrived there. According to diplomatic circles, all foreign envoys and embassies in Moscow are either leaving or preparing to leave.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Announce Price Controls on Daily Necessities; Establishing a New Agency to Seek Effective Measures; Setting Retail Profit Margins to Prevent Profiteering; Direct Procurement from Overseas if Necessary</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has completed a comprehensive study of the price issue and will control prices and speculators to stabilize the lives of citizens. The various actions of speculators in the city have prompted the Municipal Council to take new measures. According to Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, the results of the study will be announced next week. According to a Municipal Council official, the actual completion of these measures will take some time. At the next meeting of the Municipal Council, a final decision will be made on whether it is possible to adopt new measures to control prices. According to the English-language China Press, taxpayers in the International Settlement will soon pass a new ordinance authorizing the Municipal Council to control prices and speculators.</p>
<p>Establishing a New Agency to Combat Price Increases</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Fessenden, Secretary-General and Director-General of the Municipal Council, told reporters yesterday (16th) that the Council is thoroughly studying the possibility of establishing a municipal agency to effectively address the soaring prices of food and essential commodities. An announcement on this matter is expected no later than early next week. As for the continuous increase in rents, the Council does not intend to take measures to address them for the time being, as the Council has conducted a thorough investigation and has not yet found any way to deal with this "difficult" problem. However, the Council's policy for dealing with any event is not immutable and may be changed depending on developments. When reporters asked about the Municipal Council's position on various aspects of the current economic crisis, Mr. Fessenden answered some questions without hesitation, while others he answered after consideration.</p>
<p>Lack of Controls Led to Today's Situation</p>
<p>The reporter asked, "Is the Municipal Council also responsible for the soaring prices due to the lack of sufficient controls on manipulation and hoarding?" Mr. Fessenden replied, "Yes." He also stated that it is not beneficial in principle for the Municipal Council to interfere with legitimate private trade. The Council has thoroughly and sincerely considered the problem of rising prices in Shanghai and is now studying new ways to deal with the problem. He hopes to announce the Council's policy on this issue before the beginning of next week. The reporter asked whether the Municipal Council would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with the Japanese authorities in the city to allow food from the interior to enter the International Settlement more freely.</p>
<p>Focusing on Imports from Overseas</p>
<p>Mr. Fessenden replied that the Japanese authorities are well aware of the importance of supplying Shanghai. However, the Council is now focusing its attention on importing food from overseas. At present, the Council does not intend to extend its price control policy for rice to other foods, as it believes that the operations of importers of other essential foods are quite satisfactory and that their wholesale prices only obtain fair profits. The activities of retailers are a completely different issue. The steps that the Council will take to address hoarding and profiteering by retailers are included in the plan currently under consideration and are expected to be announced soon. If the Municipal Council feels that importers are not doing their best for the public good in the future,</p>
<p>Direct Procurement by Council if Necessary</p>
<p>then it will procure other foods to Shanghai itself, just as it does with rice. Regarding the rice issue, he believes that the Council has already taken the greatest possible measures to control rice prices. The reporter also asked whether the Municipal Council could investigate and set maximum selling prices for goods already stored in warehouses in the city, as it is well known that various commodities and foods are piled up like mountains. Mr. Fessenden replied that he is satisfied that the Municipal Council has sufficient and accurate information on the goods currently in Shanghai. If the Council can establish an agency to control retail prices, then the control measures will be applied to both goods already in Shanghai and goods about to arrive. Regarding the issue of whether the cost-of-living allowances given to employees by general stores in Shanghai can maintain the same ratio as the cost-of-living allowances given to Municipal Council employees, Mr. Fessenden stated that the Municipal Council is well aware that it is a public municipal body and must reconcile its responsibilities to both its employees and its taxpayers. Consideration of employees' cost-of-living allowances should be carried out simultaneously with price controls.</p>
<p>Retail Prices Must Be Set</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, the situation in Shanghai is more complicated than elsewhere due to the overlapping of legal and political organs. It has been suggested that import merchants and the Municipal Council cooperate to report the wholesale prices sold to retailers to the Municipal Council, which would then formulate regulations to set the selling prices of various items, giving retailers a reasonable profit. It is believed that solving the price problem with more reason would be more beneficial to the city. According to sources, if the Municipal Council could come forward to manage the direct sale and control of daily necessities needed by residents within the Settlement, the Exchange Stabilization Fund would provide as much foreign exchange as possible for these necessities.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Expected to Arrive at the End of the Month; American Vessel Carrying Fuel Oil Arrives in Shanghai; Oil Rationing System Unlikely to Be Abolished for Now</h3>
<p>An American oil tanker has arrived in the city. According to the Socony Oil Company, the ship is not carrying gasoline but fuel oil. It is currently docked at the Socony pier in Pudong unloading oil. When reporters asked a Socony official whether a tanker carrying gasoline would arrive in Shanghai within the month, he said, "We hope the ship can reach Shanghai." However, it is generally believed that even if the tanker arrives this month, it will not cause the oil companies to abandon their current oil rationing system. This system may continue to be implemented until the situation is very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>President Lines Far East General Office Moves to Manila; Rumors of U.S. Ships Avoiding Direct Routes Unconfirmed</h3>
<p>The Far East General Office of the American President Lines, originally located at 51 Wuma Road, Shanghai, has, in view of the uncertain situation in the Far East, planned ahead and sent its Far East General Manager Mr. MacGowan by ship to the Philippines on September 3 to prepare for moving the Far East office from Shanghai to Manila. According to company sources, the company no longer denies this and admits that the preparations for the Manila General Office have been completed. The General Office will be located in the Philippines in the future, and Shanghai will only be a branch office. A number of important employees have also gone to the Philippines to assist in everything.</p>
<p>Direct U.S. Shipping Routes Unchanged</p>
<p>The President Coolidge and President Van Buren, which completed its maiden voyage to the Pacific, have recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong. The above two ships will arrive here before the 27th of this month and have ample cabin space. As for the President Pierce, President Cleveland, and President Taft, the General Office has decided to rename them as General ships. However, rumors that American mail ships are avoiding direct routes from Shanghai to the U.S. are unfounded. The cause may be that the President Pierce was originally scheduled to sail from Hong Kong to Shanghai and then to the U.S. on September 27, but was ordered to stop sailing directly from Shanghai to the U.S. and only returned to Hong Kong after arriving in Shanghai to return to the U.S. The Shanghai office has not heard of this.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Manila Flights Twice Weekly</p>
<p>Since the customs were closed, direct flights between Hong Kong and Manila have been convenient. United Air Lines has dispatched Sikorsky S-42 flying boats to fly between Hong Kong and Manila. The aircraft had already flown from San Francisco to Manila on September 23, once the U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration approves, it can be implemented. Thereafter, the Hong Kong-Manila flights will be increased to two round trips per week to replace the Boeing aircraft that changed its route to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Prices Set</h3>
<p>Seventeen Dollars and Twenty Cents per Dan</p>
<p>The selling price of coal briquettes will remain based on the market price on the 16th of this month, that is, seventeen dollars and twenty cents per dan (50 kilograms). It must not be raised without the approval of the Price Evaluation Committee. The French Concession authorities have decided that the price of coal briquettes cannot be raised unless valid documents are provided to prove the reason for the price increase.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Increase Patrols at Hongkou Bridges</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army in the Hongkou district adopted special security measures, added steel reinforcements to the Sichuan Road Bridge, and set up fortresses in important places, they have also increased patrols at the Hengbang Bridge, Shikaizi Bridge, Zhonghong Bridge, Guo Hong Bridge, Waihong Bridge, Jiaxing Road Bridge, Tilan Bridge, and various bridges along Fearon Road, as well as at various wharves along the Huangpu River. In addition to Japanese soldiers armed with guns stationed there (originally there were two posts at each bridge, but they have been abandoned for a long time, and now they have been restored due to the implementation of special precautions), the patrol teams of the Japanese military police patrol back and forth from morning to night. Sometimes they also search vehicles and pedestrians. The purpose of the unprecedented precautions taken by the Japanese is difficult to fathom. The Japanese have also implemented the same measures in Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Southern Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Post Office Expands Mail Inspection to Prevent Illegal Communications and Capital Flight</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Postal Administration, the Hong Kong Post Office has recently actively strengthened the inspection of letters sent from Hong Kong. Therefore, mail sent from Hong Kong to various places is often received later than the date it should have arrived. A reporter from the New Courier learned from another source that mail sent from Hong Kong has recently been found to violate wartime regulations, involving economic, political, and financial matters, as well as using the postal service to attempt capital flight and communications that violate financial laws. There are also cases of privately sending banknotes abroad. The Hong Kong Post Office has increased its inspection staff and expanded its inspection work in order to achieve strict inspection.</p>
<h3>Meat Prices Fall, But Supply Remains Insufficient</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that well-informed sources claim that meat prices fell sharply yesterday (16th), and the market situation has improved. However, the supply of livestock that can be obtained here has not increased or decreased. It was reported last week that frequent movements of Japanese troops in the suburbs of Shanghai hindered the transportation of livestock to Shanghai, causing meat prices to skyrocket to six yuan per catty. It has now fallen back to about three yuan. Well-informed sources also said that at the beginning of July, the Municipal Council's slaughterhouse, which was leased to the Japanese, retained only the right to inspect the slaughterhouse.</p>
<h3>Commemoration of Muhammad's Ascension; Muslims to Pray Tonight</h3>
<p>Tonight is the night of the spiritual ascension of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. More than 100,000 Muslims in the city, in addition to their regular prayers during Ramadan, will gather in various mosques tonight to hold the "Qadr" evening service to commemorate the military. After Muslims in the city began fasting on the 11th of last month, they will break the fast on the 22nd of this month. Various mosques in the city are scheduled to hold breaking-of-the-fast ceremonies at 8:00 a.m. on that morning and will publish special editions of the breaking-of-the-fast ceremony. The Zhejiang Road Mosque will also hold a gathering of Arab friends with Hafiz Ahmed on that day. Mr. Ahmed has been engaged in business in Japan and has returned to China via Shanghai due to the freezing of funds. Muslims in the city have invited him to lead the prayers and recite a book of the Quran every night so that he can complete all 30 books of the Quran during the month of Ramadan. Because few Chinese Muslims can recite the entire Quran, this is an innovation in the city.</p>
<h3>Catholic Priests in China Must Strictly Abide by Chinese Laws; Changsha Diocese Authorities Issue Solemn Statement; Claims of Forcing Refugees to Wave at the Sky Are Untrue</h3>
<p>The general representative office of the Franciscan Order of the Catholic Church in this port is shocked by the Changsha incident. Regarding the Reuters dispatches published in Shanghai on October 11 and 13, which stated that when the situation in Changsha was tense, most residents took refuge in the empty courtyards of German and Italian churches, and German and Italian priests organized these refugees and made them gather in the square. When a group of news reporters flew overhead that day, the priests ordered the people to wave at the sky. Twelve priests have now been expelled for malicious activities, and the status of other German and Italian priests in Free China may be adversely affected.</p>
<p>Diocese Authorities Issue Solemn Statement</p>
<p>The authorities of this diocese solemnly declare that Catholic missionaries must strictly abide by the laws of the country in which they are located and are prohibited from participating in political issues. Their work is limited to evangelism and charitable work. There are missionaries of 24 nationalities in China, and in addition to German and Italian priests, there are also British and French priests in the Changsha Catholic Diocese, and the representative of the association in Free China is an American priest. The alleged malicious activities are a misrepresentation. Moreover, foreign reporters flying over Changsha have never reported that Catholic refugees waved. According to Reuters, the Japanese forced refugees to move out regardless of the priests' protests.</p>
<p>Missionary Status Seriously Affected</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, Catholic priests in Changsha have worked hard in their positions, establishing Catholic hospitals and orphanages to serve refugees. All middle school buildings have been requisitioned for refugee use every day for the past four years. During the Changsha fire two years ago, the relief work of the missionaries was recognized by the public. On August 3 this year, the Catholic Church suffered a bombing, resulting in one death and huge losses to several church properties and hospitals. The nuns serving in the Changsha Hospital and the Sacred Heart Hospital of the Public Charity Hospital in this city, as well as the nuns who previously served in the refugee area of Nanshi, are all Sisters of the Franciscan Order. Their charity and amiability are admired by the general public. Now that the French, German, and Italian male and female priests in Changsha have been forced to withdraw, the charitable work of the schools, orphanages, and refugee shelters in the district is unfortunately affected. As described by Reuters, if the situation is serious, the future will endanger the status of other missionaries in Free China.</p>
<h3>U.S. Does Not Intend to Publish a Blacklist of Axis-Controlled Businesses; Shanghai Merchants Must Obtain U.S. Consular Approval for Orders; and Control Usage to the Greatest Possible Extent</h3>
<p>The China Press reports that, according to information received by the British Ministry of Economic Warfare in London yesterday (16th), the German government has formally warned Nanjing that the United States intends to publish a list of businesses in China that trade with the Axis powers and prohibit American businesses from dealing with them. Therefore, the German side suggested methods such as prohibiting the dissemination of this "economic sanction" by using a blacklist of businesses.</p>
<p>No Dealings with Unfriendly Countries</p>
<p>Regarding this news in the area, a reporter asked an official at the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai yesterday. He stated that the U.S. government has not published a blacklist of businesses in China, but it is generally known that the United States has controlled the use of goods shipped to the Far East or other parts of the world, especially war materiel. The purpose of this move is, of course, to prevent these goods from reaching unfriendly countries. This measure is now being applied to Shanghai, just as it is being applied to other parts of the world that have trade with the U.S.</p>
<p>Shanghai Merchants Must Obtain Approval</p>
<p>As far as Shanghai merchants ordering American goods is concerned, the orderer must first apply for the approval of the U.S. Consulate, and the application must state the details of the name and use of the goods. This method applies to American goods that require an export license, and most of America's exported goods are already on the license list. The U.S. Consulate must investigate licensed export goods in order to determine their final use. The various sections of the Reuters dispatch may refer to this. Although there are no plans to create a blacklist now, there are some businesses that American businesses will obviously not trade with.</p>
<p>Cautious Transactions Based on Experience</p>
<p>The reporter further asked whether there was a possibility of issuing this blacklist in the future. The official replied that there is no difference between issuing a blacklist and American businesses knowing from experience that they cannot trade with certain businesses. The United States has issued a blacklist of German businesses in South America that are prohibited from trading. For the Far East, it controls the use of American goods to the greatest possible extent. This cannot be compared to the South American blacklist method. The U.S. Consulate is well acquainted with the businesses here, and all those who import American goods must guarantee that their disposal of American goods will be in line with current American policies.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Retreating from Little Luzon Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Japanese residents from various parts of Southeast Asia, concentrating in Little Luzon to retreat to Shanghai to await ships to return to their country, have already passed through Shanghai in several batches. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the French mail ship D'Artagnan, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, had 100 Japanese residents on board who were retreating from Little Luzon. The ship departed from Saigon this time, passing through Little Luzon to Shanghai, loaded with more than 8,000 packages of corn, and also loaded 1.18 million feet of lumber from Little Luzon. There were a total of 133 passengers. In addition to the 27 passengers who boarded the ship in Saigon, the remaining 106 passengers boarded the ship in Little Luzon. Some of them were not Japanese. Approximately 100 of the retreating Japanese residents. After the ship entered the port, it berthed at buoys 11 and 12. The Japanese residents disembarked in Hongkou, and the rest disembarked at the Customs pier. The ship will spend four or five days in Shanghai and return to Saigon on the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Bund Ferry Resumes Service</h3>
<p>Since the Bund-Former Municipal Ferry was occupied by the Japanese, the staff suddenly went on strike a few days ago, causing the ferry to stop running. After a stalemate for many days, it was resolved after a 20% salary increase.</p>
<h3>Plumbing and Carpentry Strike</h3>
<p>Workers in the plumbing and carpentry industries in this city have recently found life increasingly difficult and have elected representatives to negotiate with employers to moderately increase wages. After nearly a month of negotiations, the two sides failed to reach an agreement due to differing opinions, and a joint strike was launched yesterday. It is estimated that there are more than 20,000 workers in the industry. If the strike is allowed to continue for a long time, it will have a significant impact on society. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will mediate.</p>
<h3>Drainage Equipment Funds; New Bonds to Be Issued; Approved for Four Million Yuan as Temporary Expenses</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council, in view of the fact that low-lying areas on various roads are flooded by rising tides or sudden rainstorms, obstructing traffic, has decided to allocate 4 million yuan for drainage equipment. Work has recently begun. However, given the Municipal Council's current financial situation, it seems quite difficult to pay the temporary expenses of 4 million yuan. The Council's Finance Committee has held several meetings to plan this huge sum and has decided to recommend that the Council issue bonds. The committee is currently planning in detail and will convene another meeting next week to make a final decision. If the committee decides to issue bonds, this will be the second time the Municipal Council has issued debt this year. It previously issued 9 million yuan in debt to make up for this year's financial deficit, and now it intends to issue another 4 million yuan in debt. Various parties have expressed great concern about the Council's move.</p>
<h3>Human Living Hell (Continued) By Bai Min</h3>
<p>Within the Hongkou district, the increasingly degenerate foreigners are mostly Russians and refugees from Germany, including several hundred stranded sailors from various countries.</p>
<p>In a fourth-class tavern, this reporter encountered two American sailors stranded in Shanghai. Both were addicted to drugs. At the time, the reporter was sitting in a corner of the tavern, drinking beer, and upon hearing the voices of the two sailors during a few seconds of musical interlude, recognized that they were Americans. A moment later, the German refugee playing the piano energetically began a song again, making it difficult to hear what the two were saying. All that was visible was one of them calling a waiter and whispering something. The waiter went outside and returned a moment later, approaching their table and handing over two small paper packets. The two sailors took out some paper money, gave it to the waiter, and then ordered a glass of vodka. They poured the powder from one of the paper packets into the glass, and drank it down in one gulp.</p>
<p>Stepping into an alley, the reporter was grabbed by the arm by a Scandinavian sailor, begging for a dollar. The man was sallow and emaciated. Though standing he swayed a bit, he showed no sign of alcohol, so he was certainly addicted to drugs.</p>
<p>The reporter has encountered many Scandinavian sailors stranded in the area for over a year. All of them were addicted to alcohol as if their lives depended on it, and few were addicted to drugs. Just a few days ago, they had received their weekly allowance from their consulates in Shanghai, and they still had some money in their pockets. They all said, "Here, we can only have fun by drinking. Why not drink to our heart's content?"</p>
<p>There are reportedly over eighty Danish sailors living in Hongkou, receiving a weekly allowance of only sixty-five yuan from the Danish consulate. If they weren't sailors, or if someone took care of them, they might be able to make ends meet with this allowance. But they are all sailors, stranded in this foreign city with nothing to do. With money in their pockets, they only care about getting drunk, living one day at a time. Who can blame them for this? One Danish sailor asked the reporter, "Can you help us go to Hong Kong? Maybe we can serve on British ships. We all want to go, but the consulate has already taken our passports. Do you know any British people who can help us go to Hong Kong?"</p>
<p>There are very few Norwegian sailors in the drug district because whenever a Norwegian sailor finishes a stint in Shanghai, the Norwegian consulate finds a way to send him to Hong Kong to serve the British. Before their departure, the consulate provides for all their expenses, including food, clothing, lodging, and pocket money. They only linger in Hongkou for a few days and are eager to leave.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Morning on Gordon Road: A Bomb Injured a Passerby</h3>
<p>Japanese Bus Passed by Unaffected; A Worker at the North China Daily News Seriously Injured</p>
<p>At around 9:18 AM yesterday, a Japanese tour bus, full of Japanese employees, was en route to a Japanese-owned cotton mill on Putuo Road, as it did daily at that hour. As it passed the intersection of Gordon Road and Xinzha Road, suddenly someone jumped out from the side of the road and threw a hand grenade. The bus passed by and was unaffected. The grenade landed in the center of the road and exploded.</p>
<p>The explosive force was immense.</p>
<p>The windows of nearby shops were all shaken. At that moment, Zhu A'quan, a coolie from the North China Daily News, was passing by on a bicycle when he was hit by shrapnel in the right breast. He bled profusely and collapsed on the spot. Nearby police officers, hearing the blast, rushed to the scene and reported to the Gordon Road police station in charge of the area. A large number of detectives were dispatched to the scene, and the nearby traffic was cut off for a thorough search, but to no avail. The Japanese bus had also sped off. The shrapnel was collected and taken back to the police station for investigation. An ambulance was urgently called to take Zhu to Baolong Hospital for treatment, and he was later transferred to Renji Hospital. It is reported that his injuries are very serious. Zhu is a local, 34 years old, and lives at No. 9, Lane 440, Wuding Road.</p>
<h3>Students of the Dago Vocational School Arrested</h3>
<p>At 5 AM yesterday, four Japanese personnel, accompanied by police detectives, went to the Dago Vocational School at the intersection of Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road. They knocked on the door to enter the school. At that time, only six students were in the dormitory and had not yet gotten up. The Japanese personnel immediately instructed the tea boy to wake all six students and bring them out of the dormitory. The students were told to stand still. The Japanese personnel took out a photograph and, stepping in front of the students, compared their faces with the photograph. As a result, one of the six students' faces matched the photograph. That student was arrested and taken away in a car. As for the student's name and origin, the police authorities are maintaining strict secrecy and will not announce it.</p>
<h3>Student of the Lester School Kidnapped</h3>
<p>At around 8 AM yesterday, a kidnapping of a student occurred in the Hongkou district. A Fujianese man named Ye, in his twenties, residing at a certain number in Lane 39, Nanyang Road, is currently studying as a freshman in the university department of the Lester School at No. 50, Yuanfang Road, Xi Huaide Road. At around 8:30 AM yesterday, Ye was on his way to school as usual when, upon reaching the front of the school, four kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. Three of them brandished pistols and threatened Ye. They forced him into a bandit vehicle parked nearby and sped away, kidnapping him. After the police received the news, they quickly dispatched detectives to investigate. According to witnesses in the vicinity, the vehicle was a black-plated car and seemed to be heading towards Jiangwan. After obtaining the clues, the police are now ordering a thorough investigation. Around 10 AM, the bandit vehicle was found on Tao Peng Road, but there was still no trace of Ye.</p>
<h3>Drug Trafficker, Scared and Fleeing, Shot Dead</h3>
<p>At 10:15 AM yesterday, a patrol vehicle of the Public Concession's reserve team was searching pedestrians and vehicles at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Mei Baige Road when a Korean drug trafficker, carrying drugs, arrived in a rickshaw. Upon seeing the detectives conducting the inspection, he became frightened and jumped out of the rickshaw, turning around and fleeing wildly. He was spotted by the detectives, who suspected that he must be a criminal and pursued him closely. Unexpectedly, the Korean man, while fleeing, took out the drugs from his bag and threw them away. The pursuing detectives, suspecting that he was taking out a weapon, opened fire. At the same time, another patrol team from the police station was also patrolling the area and opened fire from the front to stop the Korean man from fleeing. As a result, the Korean man was shot five times and collapsed to the ground. He was sent to Fumin Hospital for treatment but died soon after due to his serious injuries. It is reported that the deceased was named Aoyama, 25 years old.</p>
<h3>Major Fire at Yan Family Compound in Western Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>At around 1:57 PM yesterday, a fire broke out at the Yan Family Compound on the corner of Daxilu and Difenglu in western Shanghai. Five fire trucks from the Public Concession were dispatched to put out the fire, but the fire was raging fiercely. The compound contained a celluloid factory, which is highly flammable, and the fire spread to six or seventy other factories, including an ink factory and a soap factory. It was not until around 3 PM that the fire was extinguished. The losses are reported to be quite heavy.</p>
<h3>Funeral of French and Vietnamese Police Officers Killed on Route Paul Beau</h3>
<p>The previous evening (the 15th) at around 10 PM, a shootout occurred on Route Paul Beau in the French Concession when four bandits, attempting a kidnapping, encountered police and opened fire. French Police Officer No. 104 (San Dao Tou) and Vietnamese Police Officer No. 845 were killed in the line of duty. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the funeral of the deceased French Police Officer, Rodinong (transliteration), was held at 9 AM yesterday. The body departed from Guangci Hospital. The French police station dispatched several teams of Chinese, French, and Vietnamese police officers to escort the funeral procession. All important officials attended to pay their respects and the body was buried in the Lujiawan Cemetery. The funeral of the deceased Vietnamese police officer was held at 2 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Qiu Cao Painting Exhibition to Close Soon</h3>
<p>The painting exhibition of the famous painter Chen Qiu Cao, which opened on the 13th, is nearing its end after almost a week. More than half of the exhibited works have already been purchased by connoisseurs, mostly Chinese paintings. In recent years, Mr. Chen has devoted himself to this art form, adhering to the principle of "not belittling the ancients, not clinging to the ancients." He integrates the strengths of ancient masters' brushwork, incorporates his own ideas, and emphasizes both form and content. His emotional expression is profound, his landscape painting is full of reclusive interest, and his techniques are refined and mature. Whether meticulous or freehand, his works are exquisite and masterful. There are also two styles of plain line portraits, with elegant colors, which can be called a unique and novel creation of portraiture. There are many people who have commissioned him to paint their portraits. It is reported that the exhibition will only continue for today and tomorrow, and will not be extended.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday: The weather in North China is turning from cloudy to overcast and cooler, with fairly strong northerly winds. Here and in the East China Sea, it is turning from overcast to cloudy, with the wind shifting to the northwest. The weather around Taiwan is overcast, with localized showers, and the wind is light and directionless. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 80.8 and the lowest was 57.2. On the same day last year, the highest was 80.1 and the lowest was 58.5.</p>
<p>This newspaper was published at 6:35 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Secluded Valley Hongquan</h3>
<p>-- By Chen Qiu Cao</p>
<h3>The Enthusiasm of Fellow Students: Saving Pocket Money to Donate to Student Aid</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Currently, in any university, there are organizations of student associations from various provinces. Of course, we are no exception. We are a group of twenty-odd Minnan students from Soochow University. Three-quarters of us are from poor families, relying on the support of friends. Some of us even have to work after class. Therefore, we have held over a dozen meetings but have never enjoyed a "delicious snack" or "delicious feast." However, our enthusiasm for attending meetings has not diminished as a result. Everyone attends every meeting.</p>
<p>Because we are all young people far away from our hometowns, we inevitably feel "doubly homesick during festivals." Therefore, we take advantage of festivals to hold meetings. Each time, we save snack money and usual pocket money to make donations to help poor students or children. This year, we were very lucky. Relatives of a classmate invited us to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with them and treated us very well, which made us even more touched. We proposed that, as in previous meetings, the transportation money that the classmates brought, the pocket money that was usually saved, and the snack money should all be pooled together as a donation. The classmate's relatives and the children in his family also agreed. We raised a total of one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>We have decided to donate this meager one hundred yuan to the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund for the Poor. At the same time, we hope that the hometown associations of students in various universities and middle schools can also contribute a portion or all of their social funds as donations. Then, that kind of strength will definitely be great, and the meaning will be very far-reaching.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Minnan Students Association of Soochow University</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Japanese Cabinet's Resignation Deters Bullish Sentiment; Double Horse Yarn Declares Another Limit Down; General Observation Is That It Will Approach the 2,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned downward, and the situation is sluggish. This is because of the Japanese Cabinet's resignation, which has caused fears of changes in the international situation. In addition, the sharp decline in American cotton has dampened bullish sentiment, and the market is loosening. The market has turned downward. However, this time, from 1,750 yuan, it skyrocketed to 2,228 yuan, a huge increase of 478 yuan. Currently, the pullback could fall by half, estimated at 239 yuan, or even fall below the 2,000 yuan mark, which would not be surprising. As for current yarn transactions, they are as quiet as usual, so the prices of miscellaneous brand yarns are quite depressed, and even cheaper than Double Horse factory orders. The market price for 20-count Double Horse is 2,154 yuan, with a low price of 2,083 yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, because of the cluster of sellers, the market declared a limit down, at 2,080 yuan. Outside the market, it was initially traded at 2,070 yuan, and then at 2,081 or 2,082 yuan. In the afternoon, the spot market fell by 20 to 30 yuan, and cloth was sluggish, dropping by 3 to 9.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, and because of reports of changes in the Japanese Cabinet, sentiment suddenly softened, falling by 40 yuan. The first trade was at 2,145 yuan. Because those with profits were covering their positions, it briefly rose to 2,155 yuan. Subsequently, sellers were active, falling to 2,100 yuan. However, speculators re-entered, causing it to rise to 2,135 yuan. But the spot market price was not good, and it also showed weakness. By the time the market closed, it had fallen to 2,093 yuan. It is estimated that 15,000 bales were traded in half a day, still involving peer-to-peer transactions.</p>
<p>The futures market for Golden Double Horse sharply declined because of the reorganization of the Japanese Cabinet and the unpredictable changes in the international situation. The yarn market suffered an unexpected blow, and speculators were panicking. In the morning, American cotton plummeted by 70 to 80 points. The sharp tailwind from the previous night diminished. Therefore, the factory order market opened lower. Although it briefly rebounded, it ultimately resulted in a limit-down situation. However, the futures prices were more stable than the spot prices. In the morning, the near-term contract was at 1,910, the November contract was at 1,925, and the December contract was at 1,965. It briefly rebounded by 5 to 10 yuan due to the slightly firmer exchange and factory order markets. Ultimately, due to the unloading by retail investors and short sellers, the afternoon closing was down 30 to 50 yuan. In the afternoon, because the spot price fell to the limit down, sentiment was unsettled. Some powerful players took advantage of the low prices to buy the deferred contract and stabilize it. As a result, the near-term contract closed at 1,850 yuan, a fall of 73 yuan, the November contract closed at 1,892 yuan, a fall of only 53 yuan, and the December contract closed at 1,950 yuan, a slight fall of 43 yuan. Therefore, judging from its trend, it was entirely affected by the international situation, and the unloading by speculators and the manipulation of speculators. If the situation eases one day, those engaged in the market should pay attention to the intensity of the rebound. The following table is listed below.</p>
<h3>Indian and Vietnamese Cotton Arriving in Shanghai at the Same Time; Transactions Shift to Discussions Due to High Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is that it has become sluggish due to excessive price increases in recent days. All parties are not as healthy as in the past. At the same time, American cotton has fallen sharply, and the yarn market has declined, which has inevitably affected raw cotton to some extent. The current cotton prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>American Pungapore Cotton 100 bales 700.0 Haojiajin</p>
<p>Langong Flower 100 bales 535.0 Also</p>
<p>Also 100 bales 534.0 Also</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai: Lately, various parties have been eager to directly order foreign cotton, although the current inventory in Shanghai is scarce and the opportunity is very good. However, it is not easy to approve applications for foreign exchange. Therefore, only a few factories that hold foreign currency deposited in foreign banks can use it to offset the purchase of foreign cotton in small amounts, such as 100 to 300 bales of American cotton or Brazilian cotton. Otherwise, it is futile to call for help without a definite payment. As for the current cotton situation, it remains firm. Although the factory's appetite is not rising, the sellers' prices are too high, resulting in slightly fewer transactions. However, the transaction prices of Brazilian cotton between various colleagues for the 2-strand raw materials are all above 800 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the selling price of fire machine cotton has initially increased significantly due to the increase in coarse lint raw materials. However, in the past two or three days, the market has slightly fallen due to the lack of broad demand from factories and the ample inventory in this city. In the past two days, the transaction prices between colleagues have been around 470 yuan.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market fell due to unfavorable European war news and the re-emergence of tension in the Far East. Large numbers of speculators were selling off and limiting prices, which were very intense. In recent days, Wall Street stocks have been falling frequently, and the closing prices of the cotton market have plummeted by 72 to 73 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculators buying and short covering, but subsequently slightly fell due to cotton merchants hedging sales. Finally, the market rose again due to purchases by colleagues and European exporters. Yesterday's closing prices rose by about 7 to 8 robis each.</p>
<p>Also, it is predicted that the market will open lower by about 10 robis today due to poor international news and a sharp fall in cotton.</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Hunan transport arrived in port yesterday afternoon, carrying 2,815 bales of cotton from Xianggang. The cotton is Indian cotton, transported from India to the port and then transshipped. Also, the French Company's Dadenan mail ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In addition to a large shipment of corn from Saigon, there were also 3,517 bales of cotton, which were produced in Vietnam. The ship is currently berthed at buoys 11 and 12 and will move to the Shuntai Wharf to unload after the timber is cleared. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Finance: Futures Weak, Cash Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was mixed, with spot prices rising and futures falling, showing a diverging trend. Although there were reports of the resignation of the Japanese Cabinet, which was about to invade, cash dealers and certain banks, such as Xianghe Mingfeng Tianyuan Shihe, repeatedly entered the market. Hong Kong dealers continued to sell, so the price opened lower in the morning at 10,650 yuan, but soon began to rise. In the afternoon, it rose to a high of 11,020 yuan, but was suppressed by the heavy selling by Shunyuan. Ultimately, it was forcefully bought up by bill traders, and the price rose again, closing up 190 yuan. The October gold contract fell from 8,350 yuan to 8,130 yuan at noon due to the fact that there was a one-week cash delivery next Monday. Big players were busy closing out their positions. Only Dinglun increased its positions and Hengji competed to sell. In the afternoon, it recovered by 120 yuan in sparse trading, ultimately closing down slightly by 100 yuan. More than 1,000 taels were traded. Jewelry gold was initially priced down to 1,100 yuan, and then rose to 1,130 yuan, up 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market Foreign Exchange Transactions Turn Quiet</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw the Central Bank and HSBC both posting the same prices. The US and British exchange rates were flat at the small counters of HSBC and other banks. Black market trading of US and British exchange rates turned quiet, but the market remained relatively stable. Importers were hesitant, while Chinese merchants and private individuals were secretly still selling off their positions. After the market opened in the morning, the initial asking price for the US dollar was 3.625 yuan for sale, but at 10 o'clock, there were no buyers even at 3.75 yuan. In the afternoon, 3.875 yuan was a difficult to sell price, slightly firmer than the previous day. 2/125 (presumably 2 shillings and 1.25 pence) for the British pound still saw some buyers, the same as the closing price on the previous day, but no transactions were heard of throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Securities: The Rumor of the Collapse of the Cabinet Affects Securities; Domestic Bonds and Foreign Stocks Both Fall</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday was affected by the deterioration of Japanese-American relations and the collapse of the Japanese Cabinet. Various markets in Shanghai were slightly affected. Public bonds were greatly affected, and people became more fearful. In addition, the "Chuan Gang" (Sichuan clique) also sold off, and Category C bonds even broke through 70 yuan to a low of 69.2 yuan. Fortunately, short covering was still lively, allowing it to be maintained. However, the foundation has become weak, and there are many changes in the future environment. It cannot be measured by common sense. Yesterday morning, Tongkang Xinhua Xinfu bought Category C bonds, opening at 70.02 yuan, rising to 70.04 yuan, and then Hongda Bao lowered the price to sell, and the 70 yuan mark was broken, seeing a low price of 9.6 yuan, and closing slightly at 35 jiao at noon. In the afternoon, the situation was still oversupplied, and Lianhe Shengda sold off consistently. Fortunately, Xie Xingyuan and Tongkang short covering were also very lively, and Zhongzi also had some buying, with a small price of 9.2 yuan, closing at 1.35 yuan. As a result, there was a uniform fall of 67 jiao to a force of 5.5 jiao, with transactions of approximately 1.78 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 200 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory stock were traded, with a price of 50.05 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The stock market for public companies suddenly fell sharply due to the resignation of the Japanese cabinet. In the terrible selling pressure, general speculative investors were mostly selling without price limits. In addition, with the weekend approaching, the evolution of the situation was difficult to predict, and buyers were wary, so the price fell as soon as it rebounded, ultimately closing at a level close to the low price.</p>
<h3>Food: Using Pretexts to Exaggerate, Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The imported rice market fluctuated. The early morning opening was affected by the deterioration of US-Japan relations, which was used as a pretext to hype up the market. Buying was strong, and both futures and spot prices of rice rose uniformly. Saigon No. 1 reached 147-148 yuan, No. 2 reached 135 yuan, and small rice flour reached 133 yuan, all rising by 2-3 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. However, at that time, the Shanghai Municipal Council ordered a public sale of 2,000 tons of small rice flour, with the price up to 139.75 yuan. Sentiment softened, and the market price also fell. Small rice flour fell back to around 131 yuan. In the afternoon, there was still a meandering situation, and the small texture closed again between 132 and 133 yuan. It is estimated that the customer's hoarding of South stocks asked about it, Yinghua Si was loading 161 yuan to 162 yuan for small rice flour, the spot price was 156-158 yuan, which was more station and outer than the previous day, the volume of transactions was 15,600 packages and 400 tons. The inventory of foreign rice in the stacks was 1,054,026 packages.</p>
<h3>New Hoarding of Foreign Flour Rises, Market Wants to Stabilize, but Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The actual sales of foreign flour from the North group have been sluggish, and the market could have gradually returned to normal. However, due to the worsening of US-Japan relations and fears that transportation routes would be blocked and that later arrivals would not be possible, a new wave of large-scale hoarders rose up to absorb the market, and speculative investors also took the opportunity to buy. However, those who profited also sold off, so the price increase remained stable amidst the rise, gradually progressing by steps. Fortune and Longevity brand was sold at 40.03 yuan, the God of Wealth brand at 39.5 yuan, and the Fortress brand at 41.45 yuan in the early morning and 41.67 yuan in the afternoon. The Golden Dragon West Stack was at 39.5 yuan to 40 yuan in the early morning and from 39.95 yuan to 40.13 yuan in the afternoon, all up by 67 jiao from the previous market. 40,000 packages were traded. Wheat bran, after profits were returned, rose to 42.6 yuan in small packages, falling back to 41.5 yuan, and closing at 42 yuan in the evening. Wheat had little buying or selling, and sentiment remained good.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Selling Sentiment Declines, Oil Merchants Still Firmly Raise Prices, Resulting in a Rebound of 1-2 Yuan</h3>
<p>The actual sales of edible oil yesterday remained sluggish and uninspired. Selling sentiment declined at the beginning of the early morning market, and many retail investors reduced prices to seek sales, so the market saw a fall of 3-5 yuan. Subsequently, due to many parties coming to raise prices at the bottom, the latter market regained momentum, and the results were largely the same as the previous day, rebounding by 1-2 yuan. Tongs Market sold 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 200 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 400 loads of Dayou Factory's clear oil, 300 loads of vegetable oil from the paint factory, 100 barrels of vegetable oil from the Ri Hua factory, and 500 loads of vegetable oil from the Lide factory.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods: Eastern Piece Goods Futures Very Weak</h3>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to the deterioration of US-Japan relations, there were many rumors in the market, and people's hearts were very weak. Futures cloth followed the yarn market and fell.

<h3>Zhenhua Girls' School 35th Anniversary</h3>
<p>Suzhou Zhenhua Girls' Middle School was founded six years before the Republic of China by Wang Xie Changda, a respected figure in Suzhou's women's circles. His daughters, Wang Jizhao and Wang Jiyu, returned from studying in the United States and continued the enterprise, making continuous progress over the years and earning a reputation in Suzhou. Before the war, they built school buildings at the former Suzhou Weaving Office, with all facilities such as libraries, gymnasiums, sports grounds, and science laboratories, making it the leading private school in Suzhou, with a student population of over 800. After the war, the school buildings were completely destroyed and the teachers and students scattered. In the autumn of the 28th year, the board of directors hired a new principal to re-establish the school in Shanghai, currently using the building at 1510 Aiwenyi Road as the school's location. Since its re-establishment, the school has already held two graduation ceremonies, and all graduating high school students have been able to pursue further education and employment with outstanding results. October 19th of this year marks the 35th anniversary of the school's founding. Although in extraordinary circumstances, the alumni, teachers, and students cherish the school's history and have decided to hold a simple commemorative ceremony on that day, with performances by students from all grades. In addition, letters have been sent to all alumni in Shanghai, inviting them to attend the celebration and discuss all matters related to the alma mater.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Luo Wengan</h3>
<p>— Ping Ye</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Wengan was a senior figure in diplomacy and a scholar of profound legal knowledge. His service as an official and lecturer moved both the North and the South. Upon reading the telegram and learning of Mr. Luo's passing in the ministry, I deeply mourn his loss.</p>
<p>Mr. Luo was known for his integrity, purity, and unwavering righteousness. During the early years of the Republic of China, when Yuan Shikai was attempting to restore the monarchy, Mr. Luo, as a law enforcement official in Beiping, issued an arrest warrant against Yuan for betraying the Republic. Due to the circumstances, he was forced to leave the capital. Such a spirit of integrity and determination should be admired by the people of the nation forever. After the success of the Northern Expedition, Mr. Luo served as Minister of Justice Administration and Minister of Foreign Affairs. During his tenure as Foreign Minister, there were many changes in the East, and there were many disputes over the Luo Wenyu region. At that time, Mr. Luo's younger brother sent a letter to Mr. Luo, asking for a position. Mr. Luo never wanted to employ relatives. Even for his younger brother, he would not make any exceptions. He immediately replied in a letter, which included the words "The Luo Wenyu incident is of national concern. Public matters take precedence, how can I attend to private matters?" Throughout his life, Mr. Luo never sought personal gain for his brother due to his own prominence. His impartiality can be seen from this.</p>
<p>As Foreign Minister, Mr. Luo wore the same long robe throughout the year. Someone asked him why he didn't change to a Western suit. Mr. Luo smiled and replied, "I studied at Oxford in England in my early years, and later traveled to France and Belgium. I considered myself a fine gentleman in a troubled world. Now, I have returned from brilliance to simplicity." Mr. Luo liked to drink alcohol. In his office, besides documents, he was accompanied by Shaoxing wine bottles and cigars. He often drank until his eyes were red and swollen like walnuts, but he would not restrain his drinking. His heroic spirit did not diminish with age. Mr. Luo held important positions several times and never misused a single penny of public funds. Mr. Luo's family was wealthy, and because of his involvement in politics, he often used his family property to make up for the inadequacy of his salary. Years ago, he once said to the writer that unless he was well-known, who would believe that he held an important position but still had to supplement his livelihood with his own property? We both laughed together. Later, Mr. Luo taught in the Southwest, and I did not know his recent situation. With regret, I suddenly heard of his passing. I have described his usual words and deeds as follows.</p>
<p>Unveiling of Trivial Essays, Number Four</p>
<h3>Little Pickpocket</h3>
<p>— You Zuoxun</p>
<p>I Learned a Lesson</p>
<p>Before the war, Yangtze River steamships were extremely free. There were no registration procedures, let alone the trouble of searches. Therefore, in addition to genuine passengers, there were also a group of bad people such as petty thieves and pickpockets who specialized in stealing the belongings of "those traveling away from home."</p>
<p>I was returning to Shanghai from Hankou on a Taikoo Company passenger ship. The rapidly flowing river water pushed the ship forward like it was flying. It was an early morning, and the sun had gilded the water surface with a layer of gold. The light breeze stirred up the light waves, with glittering flashes. The smoke from the farmhouses on both sides of the river was curling up into the blue sky. I stood on the deck, gazing at the rising sun on the distant hillside. The rumbling sound of the "engine" controlled this quiet morning dawn.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a commotion in the ship's cabin. I hurriedly ran to the scene of the incident. It was a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old pickpocket who had been caught stealing things from a passenger's suitcase. He was grabbed like a chick and was about to be beaten. People around were persuading not to hit him, saying that the child was too young. Amidst the noise, the "deputy officer" came. He recognized this little pickpocket, because several months earlier, the same thing had happened, and he had been forgiven because of his young age. This time, the deputy officer was not willing to let him go so easily. He wanted to find a way to warn him. So, several servants used ropes to suspend the little pickpocket into the empty cargo hold. But the little pickpocket's expression did not change. He listened to them without concern. Soon, a little tune came from the bottom of the hold, "Sister, in the room..." This shattered the "deputy officer's" warning plan.</p>
<p>"Inspiration strikes, a plan comes to mind." The deputy officer went to light a "storm lantern" and tied it with lead wire to lower it into the hold. This time, the little pickpocket hurriedly cried out, hoarsely begging for help. The light illuminated his pitiful face, and two lines of tears kept flowing.</p>
<p>This is because the cargo hold, which had never let in sunlight, had long become a world of rats, centipedes, lizards, and poisonous insects. The little pickpocket, although in such a dangerous situation, was not unafraid, but the darkness around him had obscured everything. What was he afraid of? When the light came, it broke the confinement and illuminated every corner. He began to see the poisonous insects crawling. They were getting closer! Closer! Therefore, he shouted and screamed, hoping to escape danger immediately.</p>
<p>This is a good lesson.</p>
<p>People who are in a dangerous situation filled with poisonous insects, it is not that they do not know the danger, or do not think of escaping, it is just that the darkness around them obscures everything. If a ray of light is cast upon them, allowing them to catch a glimpse of the terrifying situation, then they will surely struggle to break free.</p>

<h3>Battlefield X-Ray Machine</h3>
<p>— Yong Yun</p>
<p>The most portable X-ray machine is the type specifically designed for battlefield use. It is now equipped in the American army. It only takes ten minutes to install, and it takes only one minute to examine a soldier. Its main use is to diagnose the location of bullets and shrapnel inside the body of wounded soldiers, because battlefield hospitals have simple equipment and no X-ray machines. More importantly, this type of X-ray machine does not require developing film. The location of the bullet can be seen immediately after the X-ray is taken. Of course, taking pictures is also possible. The stretcher in the army can be used as an operating table. The stretcher can be placed directly on the frame, and it can be removed immediately after the examination, which is extremely convenient for the wounded soldiers and without any trouble.

In their small group, apart from Lin Sheng, a young man, there were two women and a middle-aged man who looked older than his years. They were carrying very little luggage, so the journey was very difficult. As soon as they arrived in Xuzhou, Qiu Haitang was the first to fall ill.</p>
<p>"Brother, Sister-in-law, it seems that you can only go first!" Mei Bao urged them automatically, because her father had been ill for four or five days and had not recovered. Lin Sheng and his wife had been accompanying them and were already showing a lot of anxiety. Looking at the news in the newspaper, the war in Shanghai had also started. She did not want them to be delayed any longer. "I heard that our army is fighting very well in Shanghai. You should go to Nanjing as soon as possible! As soon as Dad gets better, we will follow you to find you."</p>
<p>Lin Sheng frowned and did not answer immediately. "Okay, since my sister says so, then we can only take one step ahead." Meng Da Sao said with a flushed fat face: "It's not that I can't wait, but I'm really afraid that my parents at home will be anxious. I think they must have received Dad's letter. If we don't go again, the two old people will be uneasy. Sister, then we'll see you in Nanjing...!"</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang and Mei Bao really didn't want to burden them anymore, so they let Lin Sheng settle the bill at the hotel and leave first.</p>
<p>After the Mengs left, Qiu Haitang's luck was not too bad. She continued to lie in bed for only three days, and her illness went away by eighty or ninety percent. (239)</p>

<h3>New Organization in Shanghai: 9:15 Club</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Membership Limited to Allied Nationals</p>
<p>When American new movies arrive in Shanghai, some of the best films are banned from being shown in the two settlements for political and other reasons, and movie fans are not able to see them, which is a pity. Now, the "9:15 Club" (Nine fifteen Club), organized by British expatriates in Shanghai, specializes in showing these banned films. The banned film "Escape," which was changed on the 16th of this month, stars eleven big names such as Norma Shearer and Robert Taylor. The wonder of the film is easily imaginable. I will briefly introduce the organization of the club below:</p>
<p>The 9:15 Club was only established on September 1st of this year, and a new film is changed every half month. All the proceeds, after expenses, are donated to the British War Fund. The club is not a for-profit private organization. People from Allied nations are welcome to join as members. There are currently 2,200 members of more than ten nationalities, and a campaign to recruit members is underway, aiming for a total of 4,500 people. However, the number of members is not limited to this number, and even if it increases to 10,000 people, it can be accommodated. Because currently, only one show is screened every night at 9:15 (an additional show is screened at 5:30 PM on Fridays for children to watch). If the number of members increases sharply, three shows can be screened every day at 2:30 PM, 5:30 PM, and 9:15.</p>
<p>Members are divided into three types: Basic Members, Associate Members, and "Guest Members." The entrance fee for Associate Members is 50 yuan, and the monthly fee is 10 yuan. The monthly fee for "Guest Members" is 15 yuan, of which 5 yuan is deducted each month and accumulated as membership fees. After ten months, they automatically become Associate Members. Both have the right to watch two films per month. In addition, starting from the first of next month, a "Tourist Member" program will be implemented. Basic Members or Associate Members are allowed to bring one guest to watch the film for a fee of 7.5 yuan per show. The show at 5:30 PM on Friday afternoons is for members' children to watch and is limited to children aged 14 to 16. The monthly fee per child is 6 yuan. Those who wish to join can obtain detailed rules and membership application forms from the East Building, 2nd Floor, 83 Beijing Road (telephone number 19212).</p>
<p>The films are screened on the 9th floor of the Cathay Hotel. The seats are comfortable, and the projector and screen are excellent. It is worth mentioning that Charlie Chaplin's "The Great Dictator" may also be released.</p>
<h3>International Chess</h3>
<p>— Wei Han</p>
<p>Around 1918 or 1919, this newspaper published an article by Lao Pu discussing chess, elaborating in great detail on international chess. In the winter of 1927, Xie Bian published the second collection of the "Complete Chess Manual," praising this chess greatly, including diagrams and instructions for fellow enthusiasts. Furthermore, the "Great Beauty Weekly" once featured an international chess column, selecting chess problems from Western newspapers and promoting it. Recently, there are many who love international chess in Shanghai, but also quite a few who haven't grasped the basics. Therefore, I have gathered some information to provide a brief introduction:</p>
<p>International chess is divided into black and white, with each side having sixteen pieces—one King, one Queen, two Bishops, two Knights, two Rooks (or Castles), and eight Pawns. The objective is to checkmate the opponent's King. The chess pieces are shaped realistically, and the chessboard is drawn with black and white squares, making it very aesthetically pleasing. This chess is roughly similar to Chinese chess, but the differences lie in the fact that the King and Rook can castle, and a Pawn can be promoted when it reaches the opponent's back rank. Also, the rule in Chinese chess where the generals cannot face each other and knights cannot be blocked does not exist in international chess. This art is popular worldwide, and the top player is Alekhine. He performed in Madrid, the capital of Spain, last month, and has now flown to Munich to participate in the all-European international chess competition, competing against sixteen international players.</p>
<p>Readers who are interested can send letters to this newspaper, which will forward them, to facilitate communication and research.</p>
<p>Brief News: (1) The Wenyi Society's box office is scheduled to hold the final dress rehearsal for the fourth performance at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association today, with programs including "White Peony," "Luoma Lake," "Female Escort," and "Jade Hall Spring," among others. (2) The Xiaolin Drama Society will perform the three one-act plays "Father Returns," "Female Ghost," and "Wen Tianxiang" at the Xuan Yi Palace on the morning of the 26th. It is reported that the performance will generate a surplus, which will still be donated to charity.</p>
<h3>Snippets of Opera Personalities</h3>
<p>— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrations by Zhang Yizhang</p>
<p>(5) Hua Huilin - Hua Huilin was originally a female amateur opera singer in Shanghai. Her first teachers were Feng Zihe and Li Qin Xian. Li Qin Xian specialized in Qingyi roles, while Feng Zihe was known for her talents in Hua Dan roles. Therefore, during her amateur days, in addition to Qingyi roles, she already had a considerable foundation in Hua Dan plays. Hua Huilin's stage appearance at that time was charming and beautiful, with an enchanting smile, making her very endearing. Furthermore, when she performed as a guest performer, she often only used the name "Ms. Hua" without specifying her full name, which made her even more unique. As a result, the name "Ms. Hua" was quite well-known in Shanghai at the time and was often talked about. Later, she went to Beiping and became a disciple of Wang Yaoqing, officially starting her professional career. Hua Huilin can be considered a "pioneer" among female actors who went professional from being amateur opera singers from the South and gained fame in the capital. Hua Huilin could perform both Qingyi and Hua Dan roles, in the same style as Zhang Eyun, and her acting was pure, natural, and unforced. This lighthearted and casual demeanor was also similar to Zhang Eyun. They were also both from the South. Although there were still differences in their skills, Hua Huilin was indeed a shadow of Zhang Eyun. Since she forgot her lines while singing "Fen He Wan" with Ma Lianliang at the New Light Grand Theatre, and suffered a setback, her presence has been absent from the Shanghai stage for a long time now.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Strange Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Vow to Sweep Away the Huns, Regardless of Personal Safety</p>
<p>As soon as Ma Bao saw the two men arrive, he knew they were valiant warriors. Without waiting for them to speak, he asked, "General Wu has ordered us to quickly retreat the vanguard to Shanhaiguan and then defend the pass to repel the enemy, which may give us a chance to win. Therefore, we must withdraw the entire army tonight. You two go and prepare quickly." Zhang Cangqiu couldn't help but say, "We have already prepared for battle to kill as many rebels as possible. Now that the rebels are here, we are retreating instead. When will we be able to attack Beijing and drive out the rebel Li Zicheng? Aren't we disheartening the troops and demoralizing the patriots?" Ma Bao said, "Officer Zhang, what you said is true, but this is a military order and cannot be disobeyed. If there is a loss in battle, who can bear the responsibility? Therefore, we can only obey the order to retreat. I cannot say more." Zhang Cangqiu became even angrier upon hearing this and said loudly, "The garrison commander is acting on orders, and we cannot blame him. But we two must fight the rebels before we retreat. The ancients said, 'Vow to sweep away the Huns, regardless of personal safety.' We came here to join the army to sacrifice ourselves for our country and eliminate the enemy, not to live. If we lose soldiers or generals, we two are willing to be punished and will not regret even death." Chen Fei also said, "Retreating without fighting greatly discourages the morale of the soldiers. If the garrison commander does not intend to fight, we two will lead a small number of troops and imitate Gan Ning's white cavalry to raid the enemy camp. If we win, we will return. If we lose, we will fight to the death and never let the rebels gain an advantage. If General Wu blames us, we two will bear the responsibility." Ma Bao saw that the two men were so determined that he could not stop them with words. (195)</p>
