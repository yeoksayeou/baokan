<h3 id="c14">羅邱會晤聲中之國際大局 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>日來國際間所最引人注意的事件，不是　東時局的緊迫，不是蘇德在烏克蘭的大戰，也不是德軍將要假道西班牙佔領法屬西非的傳說，而是始終在傳疑中的英美兩國當局的會晤。上面所列舉的種種情事，誠然不容吾認其重妥性，而且都具有左右未來世界大局的意義，但却都是業已發展成熟或正在發展中的事實，其動向和變動顯而易見，而英美間的會談，人人都相信是事實，而且也一定是未來局勢的主要關鍵，但除却若干揣測或推論而外，始終迄無一字正式消息的透露，於此益可體會其含義之重大當非勃倫納山隘那種例行會晤所能比擬。溯自本月三日羅斯福總統乘遊艇出遊，行蹤即嚴守秘密，且破例不許新聞記者隨行，繼而副國務卿威爾斯海長諾克斯與馬歇爾史達克阿諾爾等陸海空軍要人都聯袂離開了首都。而英首相邱吉爾，自美專使霍浦金自蘇京飛離之後，即神秘的隱蔽起來，不知所往，甚至連英國會關於戰局的辯論都不曾出席參加。現在二氏離開本國國都已滿一週，會晤一節亦成公開秘密，而兩國政府至今仍復關防嚴密，諱莫如深，迄無隻字透露，這雖是戰時應有的謹愼，但亦可看出會議性質的非常重要。照白宮秘書歐萊氏在羅斯福出遊之初所宣布，今日已爲其預定倦遊遄返之期，所待商決的問題在經過數日研討之後，當已告一段落；據隔昨合衆社的倫敦消息：衆信自本週起日本將不再有對民治國決心表示懷疑的可能，從這裹大概可以的略看出一點此一會晤的成果。</p>
<p>現在且轉而一看當前的國際情形。綜合各方動態：應該確認目前正臨到侵略與反侵略實行最後淸算的前夜，同時也就是侵略者要竭力向外衝出去以圖挽救自身惡運的時期。軸心發動侵蘇一舉，自身陷入長期苦戰的泥淖，使其遠東盟友一度感到進退維谷，另一方面，則留給了民治國以更充分的準備時間。在客觀上又替反侵略陣綫增加了蘇聯龐大的人力物力。然而這却都是對英和平攻勢與對蘇閃電戰略同告失敗的結果，決不是希特勒預料所及。全綫進攻不成，改爲中路突破猛撲莫斯科；在斯莫侖斯克漕遇頓挫之後。又改而加緊進犯奧迪薩，在戰略如此一再變換之後，姑不問此决烏克蘭命運如何，潘塞部隊的英名　銳氣都已逈非昔日了。在陸上，英軍固至今尚未實行反攻，但在空中，柏林却已經嘗到了兩面受敵的况味。這種情形如果再繼續相持一兩個月，納粹如何維持其統治正復難言，因之也就不容希特勒不在加緊攻蘇之外別覓有利的出路。南太平洋危機的嚴重固然是軸心之利。但當其仍視攻蘇爲，當前最重要任務之際，也未嘗不需要在其他方面－尤其是大西洋有所行動，俾牽制英美的積極援蘇，同時也使美國臨到兩面應付的困難，這又是納粹在其速東盟友遭受「包圍」之際所能提供的唯一援助。據日前路透社軍事評論者的分析，此際納粹尚擁有這樣的實力。維希政權的動盪，達加爾的危機，以至伊朗情况的不安。都應被視爲目前波動的國際危機中重要一環。但最危險最急迫的所在却仍是遠東，無論所謂「包圍」以至「反包圍」的眞實狀况和發展何若，軍事根據地之自越南北境伸展到暹羅海灣，三國同盟關係與所謂「新秩序」的重申，任何「包圍」皆小足使其折回的表示，待與艾登赫爾在本月六日關於泰國現勢所發平行聲明相對照來看。都證明了遠東正臨到了一個從懷柔綏靖過渡到斷然行動的關頭。倘若遠東爆發了新的事變，預料軸心之於歐洲亦必將竭盡全力從事於孤注一擲的最後一逞。</p>
<p>以今日國際雙方陣容相比較：一方是困獸之鬥，一方如新發於硎，無論實力或處境都大相懸殊，冒險者本沒有倖逞的可能；不過已往民治國曾有過被動，遲滯，優柔，苟安，和步驟不齊等等弱點存在，這大概也就是侵略陣綫一綫希望所寄託。但是此事變動不息，任何人和國家都不能永守故常，在最近月餘當中，逐處都可以看到民治國家的作用正在急劇改弦更張。此度英美當局的會晤，可信必是針對着整個的國際危局，而且對於最形緊張的所在，必更特別着眼，而劃節段的新局面的封來，大概也爲期不遠了。</p>

<h3 id="c30">美駐華記者所述　香港的景象（二） <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>邊界的景象</p>
<p>由跑馬道上去是一曲折的路，穿過山峽，引你到香港另一面的山頂。下面是許多新月形的海岸，但現在沙灘上都設置鐵絲架障礙物。在沙灘兩端有儲有隱蔽的彈藥盒，可以直射到沙灘上。</p>
<p>在另一海岸後面，有一高爾夫球塲在二片弓形陸地周圍，這球塲正處於山與海之間的綠色草坪上。天氣不論陰睛，英國人好在此地玩耍。在高爾夫球塲上面，你可以見到從山峯上主宰着香港的大房屋。如其你在一間可容五十人的大房間中用飯，你極易在進餐時震驚，只要在附近砲臺上發出一枚六吋砲彈，立刻就可在此地爆炸。</p>
<p>越過海灣到新界，你可以在一家鄕下店家吃飯，這是一所很富麗的中國廟宇，屋上舖以鉛管，是美國式的。吃過飯，容人分別乘了四輛汽車開到邊界去。英國人川來打獵，穿了粉紅色服裝在山邊流動。汽車路經過菜園，棕色光禿的山頭，半小時內你已到邊界，在一道小河和一排鐵絲架的那面，是日軍統制區域。邊界把村中一條大道分割爲二。</p>
<p>交通的要道</p>
<p>香港是富庶的，財富的象徵是廣大的滙豐銀行，是一所白色建築物，頂上有一座摩天樓，雄視全港、該銀行本年所派紅利有三百五十萬元，本港還有不少其他銀行：香港是華南銀行業保險業中心。你從未見有什麼工廠製造水門汀或砲仗。但各國貨船每年裝來貨物價值在一萬萬四千萬元以上。這些貨船經過港口停泊在丸龍一面；貨物於是再轉運到華南各省，印度支那半島·菲列賓·爪哇·和東方其他各埠。每年行駛大洋的進出船隻在三千五百艘以上。</p>
<p>在華戰事使百萬華人避難到香港和新界來自中日戰事至今，普通認爲有五百富豪逃到此地以求安全。如其不是百萬富翁呢，大都是無家可歸，不名一文的難民，香港即成爲他們能去的最後一方地，現在可怕的擁擠情形，使香港居民更其貧困。人們不能租到一間房間，只是租了房間的一個角落。有一房間中，同時有十至十二人睡在暗淡，不通空氣用布幔分隔的立方體中，看來像汚穢的火車吊舖。房屋黑暗潮濕的水泥牆壁和地板，沒有陰溝，一架油滑的狹扶梯通達到道間混雜房間，床會舖上隻排列在扶梯頭上。</p>
<p>保衛着香港</p>
<p>去年夏天英政府命令留港婦孺，一律撤退。在四十八小時中立刻有三千婦孺預備登程赴澳洲去。留在這裹的必須是現任的看護才可。大多數人認爲這個突然撤退的命令有一目的：就是告訴別人香港準備應付一切攻擊。此後英人在港口至海峽埋設水雷，佈置潛艇網，造防空洞，埋藏軍火，設置重砲，探射燈和高射砲，在必要登陸地區和經過島上的通路架設鐵絲架。他們儲有不少汽油和食物，組織人民　勇軍隊以輔佐正規陸軍。</p>
<p>就戰略說來，香港對於英國並不十分重要。可是對於英國在東方的聲望是很重要的，也是在中國的最後商業根據地。任何人在此住上數星期就可知逍他們的政策。（完）</p>
<p>香港赤貧遍地。此爲小販　集之街，有梳頭孃爲之梳頭。汚穢，疾病，貧乏就是中國大多數人的命運、</p>
<p>香港山巔層樓　翠，極盡富麗能事。圖示何東爵士私邸。</p>

<p>美國羅斯福總統曾於今年一月裹，派遺專使霍浦金Harry　L.Hopkins到倫敦會見邱吉爾，宣達美國援助民治陣錢的意旨，七月間，又派他到莫斯科，會見史丹林，宣達同樣使命，將來且有訪問重慶的可能。這位人物僕僕民主陣綫各首都，可說是國際問一紅人，茲介紹其身世如次：</p>
<p>霍浦金初非聲勢煊赫的人物。但他和羅斯福總統早夕共處親如家人，總統手下數千僚屬，沒有一個比得上他。別人縱居高官顯位，在政治舞台灼手可熱，還有在社會上聲望卓著，然而霍浦金是羅斯福家屬以外得以長期下榻「白宮」的唯一嘉賓，他與總統關係的密切，可想而知。</p>
<p>總統每天從上午九時起到下午九時止，延見的客人，無非是赫赫的名流和卓越的政治家。但他公務完畢，杜門謝客，坐下來休息的時候，够得上和他促膝談心的，就非老朋友霍浦金莫屬了。總統和他，誼屬至友，親同父子。然而何以會到這種程度呢？霍浦金富於理解，善於體貼，總統有什麼心事，他不猜則巳，一猜便着。有人比他爲總　　故的親信霍Coreis　MeharryHowe，確有許多相像的地方。</p>
<p>美國老練的政治家，對於霍浦金敬愛有加。當他在一九三三年初到華盛頓的時候，非經介紹，人們都不曉得他的眞姓大名。甚至有人知道他的來歷後，也不過當他是總統「新政」運動一信徒而已。</p>
<p>當時在羅期福左右策劃新政的人物，有所謂「智囊團」的，人人們對於其中份子，莫不紛紛揣測。雷蒙特摩萊Raymond　Moley即其一，此人是有名的個人主義者。此外如都格戚爾Rxford　Guy　Tugwell人品卓絕，且美於豐姿。裴爾A.A.Berle（現任國務院幫辦）專心致志，頗具學者風度。</p>
<p>至於霍浦金呢，也有他的特長，但性質與上述諸人不同，直到他喬居白宮爲總統親信時止，外表上看來，始終碌碌無奇。一身衣服掩不了他瘦骨嶙岣的肘角和膝蓋。他的外表恰像一個農家唱小曲的收童。要不是凝神的眸子及特別長方的臉，他沒有一些驚人之處。然而也許就因爲他因這一些特色，能和他的政敵大戰三百回合，並能從去年九死一生的大病中，恢復健康。</p>
<p>他從靑年時代起，就落拓不覊，但他並不魯莽，處事機警，有時手段發辣。他的獲得總統識拔，由一個小小社會工作人員，而爲部長，而爲總統最親信的顧問，乃至爲世界運命有關的民治陣綫各國的聯絡員，決非偶然。</p>
<p>伊沃華州是人村輩出的地方，該州有志靑年，都以紐約爲發展之所。霍浦金於五十年前，生在該州蘇市地方，家境貧寒。在木州格立尼爾專門學校畢業後，也像別的伊沃華州人一樣，到紐的去謀生。他先在全國最大的私人慈善團體「貧民福利協會」担任調查員的工作。這時因工作之便，發現社會的矛盾現象，富者生活豪侈，貧者早不保夕，不期然對於一般貧民，生川無限的同情，這是他後來致力　會救濟事業的起因。</p>
<p>這個少年伊沃華州人，在新的環境中，力圖上進，一九一五年，任紐約兒童福利局長，這時還不過二十五歲。一九二二年後，川仟紐的防癆協會總幹事，他的活動節圍逐漸擴大，且引起羅斯福的注意。當時羅斯福新仟紐的州長，委他爲紐約州隨時緊急救濟局長，他於是如魚得水，得以儘量發揮他的抱負了。</p>
<p>他在紐約的工作，不過是日後在華盛頓川力的張本。一九三三年五月，羅斯福總統走馬上任，帶了一批人才，實行「新政」。霍浦金奉召到京，處在各位權威之間，不過一個無名小卒。常總救向參議院銀行與幣制委員會批舉他爲聯邦救濟局局長的時候，參院諸公，對於這個陌生名字，都面面相覷，不知怎樣是好。（未完）</p>

<p>各國駐軍及商團昨出動　西區一帶搜查特殊嚴厲</p>
<p>兩租界當局自於前晨開始特別戒備後、昨爲第日、防範情形益見嚴密、宵禁法令、本自晚十二時半至翌晨六時爲止、惟平日每於淸晨四時左右、即可通行、故實際已無形縮短、今旣實施特別戒備、故昨晨兩租界在四時後、仍不准行人通行、直至五時後、方獲自由行走、</p>

<p>兩租界除制止各種集會、並封鎖一部份交通外、復出動全部巡遲隊·便衣隊·車巡隊·四出巡查、隨路檢查行人車輛、公共租界方面之萬國商團、亦協同維持治安、美駐軍防範虞洽卿路以西勞勃生路以南地段、意駐車保護勞勃生路北及越界築路部份、至虞洽卿路以東外灘以西之英軍防區、則完全由萬國商團英國團丁負責治安、</p>

<p>據徐家滙犬文台報告、颶風自掠過本埠、竄入黃海後、大致已迫近威海衛、因日方對華北氣象之停止報告、故其確實經緯度不詳、另一颶風、在南太平洋崛起後、昨日午後二時、進抵北緯二十六度、東經一百二十一度半之處、向正北方向疾進、本埠又受其威脅、</p>

<p>無限隱痛儘管流着熱淚　母遭父棄苦度凄凉歲月</p>
<p>（一）不情之兄</p>
<p>「煮豆燃豆萁，豆在釜中泣；</p>
<p>本是同根生，相煎胡太急。」</p>
<p>這是曹子建感嘅厄境的詩，在昨天我接見二十多位申請助學者的當中有一位，他垂涕而道他的申請理出，頓時不能不使我要重溫這首詩，同時控制不住我無限同悄的感想，但又不能不對於他的老兄寄予多少勇於改過的期望。</p>
<p>這位申請助學金的學生，他的父親，年老不克生產，他是依兄嫂而居，其兄每月收入達三百餘元，這個月薪數目，本不該再需要申請給予他的弟弟助學金的，他家庭的人口，有十幾人，平心而論，在這物價高漲的浪潮中，在五六個子女學費負擔中，他的哥哥是未必能够應付裕如的，可是總還不致於到羅掘俱窮的地步，他旣然申請助學金，我們的推想，或許該生有着隱痛，談話的結果，不幸而適如預料，原來他的老兄爲了負擔之重，老弟就首當其衝，學費無着，他祇流着熱淚，他絕不願流露他老兄不允繳費的事實，可是事實還是不能湮沒的，這種類似的事實，我想形形色色的社會中，難免還有。我們同情該生求學的遭遇，我們期待其兄的誠懇自省，我們對於該生，衛情酌理，絕不願使其學業稍受阻礙。</p>
<p>（二）無義之父</p>
<p>「但見新人笑，那聞舊人哭」。</p>
<p>她是一位女生，她的父親在某地教課，可是他竟不顧其妻女的生活，而早已另有所眷，聽任弱妻幼女，迫而來滬，幸而他的妻子，早年曾受相當教育，謀得一小學教職，以四五十元一月的教薪，維持母女兩人的生活，爲着女見的前途，她才來申請助學金，這些經過的事實，她母女倆該是隱痛萬分的！可是她的父親，以一個智識分子，忍拋妻女於不顧，如果能够至誠的自譴，必定覺得負疚實深，同時我們對於她的父親，也不免有愧作人倫師表之感，但是還希望君子之過，如日月之食，如果他能够過則不憚改，我們當然還是「人皆仰之」的企求着。</p>
<p>當我們接見了不少靑年學子以後，腦海中不能臼己的湧現着這幾件社會上不幸事件的印像，我們總覺得希望能够再不聽到這些凄楚聲，免得有傷那些穉弱學生的心靈，要是幸而能够拯救這幾位正受苦痛的學生，使他們的家庭重得融融洩洩之樂，那眞是「跂予望之」了！（N）</p>

<p>自烟白煤斤及自來水迭决增加售價後、全市五百餘家熟水店、不無遭受嚴重打擊、蓋熟水泰半係供給平民所應用、熟水店公會爲减輕平民負擔、及共謀抑平物價起見、對於熟水售價、曾嚴令不得暗中抬高、全市熟水店亦幸能共體斯旨、互守規章、茲因自來水公司復於七月份起增加自來水附加費、各熟水店開支愈感浩繁、維持益趨不易、</p>
<p>要求優待</p>
<p>茲悉全市五百餘家熟水店因開支增加、維持不易所致、邇日各熟水店店主均粉紛携文向該業公會呼籲、要求即向兩租界自來水公司提出交涉、予以顧全平民生計、及共同協助當局澈底抑平物價、優待供給自來水、或變更計算方法、或將附加費用予以轄免、以輕成本、並維原價發售熟水、茲熟水店公會各委員鑒於會員等所陳各節確係事實、刻　在　密研討中、</p>

<p>昨據該會常委季建明張德龍葉漢俊等語新聲社記者、查敝業因戰後煤水價格高漲、致維持困難、曾羣相閉歇、乃致發生四大社會問題、（一）因熟水店停業、市民必自燒水、值此孤島人口密集、屋如鴿　之際、易滋火患、（二）煤爐日夜燃燒、因受煤氣而致窒息者必增、（三）勞工階級勢必多飮生水、易患疾病、攸關衛生、（四）全市賴熟水店生活者近萬人、屆時因熟永店停業、必將遭受失業、故上述各點、殊不容忽視、</p>

<p>標本兼施</p>
<p>至於抑平物價之應取措置、本會曾經一再籌商、僉以物價上升廠結、不外大宗物品被操縱壟斷所致、並若輩居心叵測、屢待國際局勢稍有變動、即活躍市塲、囤貨居奇、抬價漁利、故欲抑平物價之唯一善策、亟待採取標本兼施有效辦法、一面即在協助商人疏通貨品已製成品或非製成品等來源、以期增加市塲現貨籌碼、</p>
<p>取締惡風</p>
<p>一方面對於囤貨居奇惡風、即須澈底取締、如再任其長此以往、則國內外貨品及原料來源雖湧、而各業市塲現貨籌碼勢難增多、市塲現貨旣不充斥、則人心勢必緊俏、各類物品售價、亦仍將頻頻上升、對於此點、兩當局雖曾三令五申、惟若輩竟仍陽奉陰違、視若莫睹、故本會對於取締囤積居奇之惡風、決將從嚴進行、</p>

<p>因爲他的家屬不在上海，只是一人寄宿學校裏，我們便邀他到館裏來面談。他狹着一本書，準時而來，一件舊藍布的長衫，映着他那一副消瘦的面孔，越發的顯得憔悴了。他設：一家父從前在財政部秘書處担任保管檔案的職務，八一三戰後，撒往漢口。這個當兒，家母不幸在南京棄養，我和兩價妹妹隨着家祖父，姨祖母，避到常州，不幸原籍的住屋，又被炸燬，棲身無處，再走鄕間，靠親友補助度日。二十八年我們才來上海。那裏曉得家祖父這一年又傳噩耗，於是家境日下。而姨祖母也　之去世。等喪事料理完畢，已經是債台高築。我因爲重重的打擊，去年患了一塲大病，兩個妹妹也從此輟學了」。說到這裏，他情不自禁的泫然淚下。停了一會，他用手按着他的書，接下去說：「因爲家父的收入，不足補助家用，所以我兩個妹妹祗得寄麥在親戚的地方。我的食住，則依靠借貸和典當，但是那裏有許多地方可以借貸，和許多東西可以典當」！他的聲音漸漸的低下去了，想了一想又說：「家祖父的寄柩費巳經欠了兩年，家母的靈柩還不知道怎樣」？他很悲憤的，把語調轉到自己身上，自嘆前途：「我就是中學畢業又怎麼樣呢」？記者同情他，安慰他，並且鼓勵他：一靑年人不應該這樣的頹喪，要振作起來」！他興奮了，「我如果能得到申報的助學金，繼續我的學業，我的高興就超過了一切，而永誌不忘」！他懷着殷切的期望告別了我。（D）</p>

<p>— 袁善徵</p>
<p>（四）分類研究　植物的分類是研究植物學的一種重要工作、我們已經研究植物的形態學便可着手研究分類學、研究的方法、便是採集各種充分發長的植物、利用檢索表（Key）和標本對照、逐步查下去、一步不誤、便可知道該植物的科屬、至於各類的特徵、是科學家從許多植物的形態性質等歸納起來的、除極重要的門類外、不必强記、</p>
<p>（五）精密記載　我們仔細觀察植物的形態、生長及斷定牠的類別以後、即用文字或繪圖記載、以便日後查考、一·文字記載最好擬定一表格、分根·莖·葉·花·果實·種子等項、依次塡寫正確、二·繪圖方法、A先將植物仔細觀察淸楚、然後按植物之構造先用鉛筆輕輕的分成若干區、自紙的左邊到右邊或自上至下逐步描繪、俟畢肖時再加深鉛筆痕跡、B繪圖於紙之一面、所繪之圖、排列耍勻稱、C圖分三種、一爲寫眞圖、二爲模式圖、三爲詳圖、D所畫之錢、須光潔而連續、轉角與迴周等綫、也要聯綴胞合、E在圖下註明何圖、圖之各部須註字、註字所畫之綫宜平直、絕對不可交又、</p>
<p>（六）製作標本　因文字或繪圖記載、有時不及實物正確、我們於採集標本之後、取其全部或選擇一部分製成標本、以便研究而助記憶、最普通的是壓製標本、他如各種葉片標本、果實標本、根的標本等、以供研究形態學之用、</p>
<p>（七）讀書提要　初學者對於植物學、最感苦惱的便是不易記憶、我們用以上的方法切實研究、自易記憶、參考書和敎科書也是研究學問的工具、於閱讀明白之後、提出要點、製成表解、使條理分淸、一目瞭然、旣便記憶、目可節省下决翻閱的時間和腦力、</p>

<h3 id="c78">消夏法 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 白正</p>
<p>近幾天來，火傘高張，柏油路曬得軟綿綿，行道樹張得綠油油；知了的高噪，和賣冰賣瓜者的在叫，交織了一幅盛夏的畫面。一陣陣的熱浪，衝　到孤島上的每一個人身上；便有「熱呀！熱呀！」的吶喊，在每一個人的嘴裏超了反響。的確，寒暑表上的水銀柱巳接近百度天關，而且孤島上物價的飛漲，也達到了沸熱點，似乎和這幾天來的氣候互相呼應。所以寄居在孤島上的人們，處在這雙重淫威壓迫之下，委實透不過氣來，宛如打落在水深火熱的地獄裏一樣；然而日子依舊要過的啊！因此消夏便無形的變成了一個最新鮮的名詞，在這種火天熱地之中，如何可以安逸地消磨這炎炎長夏呢？但消夏的方法，各有不同，戰前可到廬山，靑島，莫干山去避暑，如今步步荊棘，只得縮在孤島上來度此長夏。其消夏法兩種方式：</p>
<p>（一）物質的消夏法：西瓜，冰結凝，汽水，刨冰，橘子汁等便成爲消夏的妙品，西瓜可以解渴利尿，這是天然的國貨冷食，一向在夏令中最出風頭。然而在戰前西瓜本是大衆化的，如今瓜價太貴，只有富有階級才可儘量享受了。冰結凝，橘子汁等的凉入心腑，也不失爲消夏的妙品，風味與西瓜截然不同，可說是各有千秋。現今的棒冰竟代替了西瓜，變成了大衆化的冷飮品，叉冷又甜，可惜在滋養方面不及西風和冰結凝了。游泳本是挺好的夏令運動，現在海濱不能去，只好擠在那種狹小的人造游泳池裏了。但對於身體健康上多少有一些裨益。有的人晚上無事，到冷氣舞廳裏去坐坐，那倒也是一種特殊消夏法</p>
<p>（二）精神的消夏法：夏畫炎熱，無心做事，最好是一卷在手，讀讀各種愛讀的小說雜書，或是「西風」「萬象」「小說月報」「樂觀」「永安」等各種雜誌，躺在凉蓆上，消磨過一個半天？增加些精神食糧，一方面開了無綫電，聽聽音樂歌唱，這時心定自然凉，一些不覺炎熱了。要是無所事事，整日閒散，煩燥在心頭發燒，更覺得熱浪的困人，有的找尋些不正當的娛樂，來刺激精神，終於使他萎靡不振，這是消夏的不得其法，所以你要揀選正當的消夏法才是。</p>
<h3 id="c79">漫談消夏 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 雅明</p>
<p>在上海這個都市裏談消夏，倒先要仔細地思索一番，因爲在都市裏決不比在避暑的地方，有着種種環境上的限制。</p>
<p>然而我想假使我們能　稍爲利用一點頭腦，消夏是不會成爲問題的。我以爲消夏的最大目的，就是在這夏天在合乎衛生健康的條件之下過去，那末就要問你，你喜歡用動的方法，還是用靜的方法。</p>
<p>如果你喜歡用動的方法，那末雖則你不能乘着船到你的避暑勝地，你可以坐下雙層公共汽車周行一次；雖則你不能爬上莫干山，你可以走到九層的大廈上去高眺遠矚一番，雖則你不能在沙灘上漫步，你可以在濃藝之下閒蕩，都可以使你的身心安泰，况且又有這麼多的地方可以去。</p>
<p>即使在家庭中，你也可以調製各種夏季的飮食，做你從來不會做過的家事，使你得到新的趣味。</p>
<p>如果你喜歡靜的方法，那來你可以從無綫電中收聽你最愛聽的節目，挑選幾本心愛作家所著的書閱讀起來，你可以收集瀏覽世界各地的風景畫片，瑞士的雪山和阿爾卑士山的雪景等於是一服淸凉劑，可以使你遍體凉快，各國的勝景可以把你的思想帶到那些值得留運的境地。</p>
<p>再不然你可以研究奕棋圍棋，象棋，以及盛行歐美的棋子；或者從事收集郵票，或者創造一些工藝品；或者從事繪圖，凡是能殼使你利用腦力的方法，都可以使你的身體安定，旣合乎你的需要，更可以避免暑氣。研究消遣的專家說，你有了正當的消遣，就可以得到快樂Be　Happy　withA.Hobby，其實這些消遣，還是優美的消夏方法呢。</p>
<h3 id="c80">香港的「雪」 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 三三</p>
<p>香港是終年不下雪的。</p>
<p>夏天，當你走在香港的馬路上時，也可以看到有些店舖內有個（通常是紅色的）大箱子，上面寫着一個白色大字：「雪」。要知道這裏邊儲藏的並不是像壓緊的雪塊」的乾燥氷（固體的二氧化炭），而是透明的，很硬的，會溶的——實在就是「人造氷」呀！這種「雪」每日從「雪廠」繩到各上述分銷處，鋸開了分賣給廚司，和經營冷飲的小販等。</p>
<p>要是你指着它對廣東人說：「這是氷，不是雪。」他們準會跟你爭辯，硬說「係雪」（「係」即粵語中的「是」，讀若　　）所以生長在港地的廣東人不識雪的。一般小學生在敎科書上看得放大鏡下成六角形的雪片繪圖時，都祇會睜大了眼睛，如果又遇到是一個閱歷較差的敎員，也就胡亂的說一陣……</p>
<p>記得香港去年曾一度降過大雪，這次，我想香港人大槪巳認識眞正的「雪」了　？</p>

<h3 id="c82">閒話西瓜 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 宗琦</p>
<p>當『楊梅黑楊梅」的叫賣聲，絕饗於弄堂裏的時候，代而之起的是「西瓜要　西瓜，老虎黃西瓜。」所以我們便來談談西瓜。</p>
<p>西瓜又名寒瓜，想係性冷之故，普通稱爲西瓜者，則以其來自西域，移植中國，故稱西瓜。</p>
<p>西瓜移植中國的歷史，據五代史說，五代時胡翰從契丹帶回瓜種，（按今新疆哈密縣，以附近多沃田甘泉，所產哈密瓜，仍名聞遐邇）以牛糞拌種，結瓜大而甜，名日西瓜，據此西瓜乃契丹土產，至五代時始輸入中國，又有一說：西瓜本產於浙東，尤以永嘉所產者爲最著，漸漸傳佈全國云。以筆者管見，前者較爲可信。</p>
<p>西瓜產地，今以江南爲盛，若平湖之三白，浦東三林塘之老虎黃，皆　富汁多，淸甜可口，故早巳聞名各地，現平湖及三林塘巳不堪回首了，於此米珠薪桂的當口，衣食的恐怖緊緊抓住農民的喉朧，瓜田變爲稻田，乃意中事。即便偶有種植，鄕間旣賣不出好價，運往上海來吧，又須備受苛捐。有時瓜田中的瓜，往往會無故被人强食。</p>
<p>今年西瓜之價，誠非吾輩窮小子所能夢想，但我敢相信，明年今日，我們常可痛痛快快的大啖其老虎黃及三白西瓜了。</p>

<p>夏天日長，正是最好的讀書季節，雖則感到讀書興趣的人，無論在那一個季節裏，都在極端地增加他們讀書底享受的。</p>
<p>然而讀書也得有適當的方法，方能使你獲得眞正的讀書的利益。據美國一個年輕的哲學家亞得勒－他是芝加哥大學提倡文藝復興的一個努力者，在美國的讀書界，具有極大的聲望－最好的讀書方法，聲要利用寫的工作，以下就是他的理論和方法。</p>
<p>購買一本書，只是你擁有書籍的序幕，除非你把書中的材料變爲你的一部份，實際上你就不能說你是擁有那一本書。如果你要吸收書中的材料，那末就需要書寫的工作了。這一種書寫的工作，有幾種優點，就是</p>
<p>一，可以使你在讀書時淸醒着。</p>
<p>二，因爲眞正的讀書實在就是思想的工作，思想就需要用寫或講的方法表達出來。</p>
<p>三，經過寫的工作以後，你可以把書中的村料放進你的頭腦。使你正如面對着作家，在作最投機的談話，這就是讀書的至樂。</p>
<p>自然這裏所說的是比較需要思索或是求解答問題的書，普通的小說和消閒的書籍，志在消應時間，可以隨便閱讀。</p>
<p>至於以書寫的方法讀書，可以分爲幾種：</p>
<p>一，利用文宇下面劃綫的方法，把緊要的地方劃出來。</p>
<p>二，在文字的旁邊，就是書中空白的地方劃錢。</p>
<p>三，用星形或其他符號，註在重要的地方，使將來翻閱的時候立刻就可以看到重要的部份。</p>
<p>四，在文字旁邊的空白地位，註上號碼，使全書重要的幾點，順着次序記錄起來。</p>
<p>五，在文字的旁邊註明頁數，表示在某一頁上，也有同等的討論。</p>
<p>六，把軍要的字句圈起來</p>
<p>七，在空白的地方，寫出自己的聞題，可能時再註上答案。經過這種工作以後，不但書中的材料，變成了你的一部份，即使是你的書，因爲你曾經費去許多精神，也不願意輕予出借，而願意牠始終成爲你的所有物了。·李思華·</p>

<p>— 陳麗華</p>
<p>冷氣布」這個名字是筆者替它題的，因為各大建樂，各大戲院，舞廳……一入炎夏，都有冷氣的裝置，但是在普通的家庭裏？有了一隻電風扇巳經算很好了，而况電費又貴，很不上算。那麼只有勞動雙手，以扇子來代替，不過那很費力，所以我們最好能省錢省力，使身體感凉快。</p>
<p>因此筆者想出一個方法，雖然比不上冷氣，但其减熱的功效却也不小，好在省錢省力，落得利用利用。</p>
<p>假使在炎熟的中午或下午，你在地上噴些水，不多一會就乾，這便表明有一部分水要被陽光（熱）吸收去的，要是沒有這一部分水，顯然的它然）便要吸收我們體內的水分了，那麼我們不是更要覺得熱了嗎</p>
<p>所以我們的「冷氣布」，就是根據這個道理造成的：方法筒單得很，只要用一塊隨便什麼的布，把它在水裏浸濕了，　後將它像窗布一樣掛在窗口或陽光照得着的地方，你坐在這浸濕的布幕後面，可以任意做你所要做的事，因爲這「冷氣布一方面可以代窗帘或簾子，一方回又代替你體內的水分，陽光旣不易射進來，室內又感覺風凉，有時，偶然有一陣凉風吹過，你「冷氣布」也隨風飄動，就有許多小小水滴向你吹來，更覺凉快了。</p>

<h3 id="c91">英美凍結中國資金與上海匯市 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 孫禮楡</p>
<p>七月二十六日英美下令凍結中日資金以後，引起中日經濟上極大的反響，尤其上海外匯市塲，經此變化，完全改變面目。昔日資金隨意逃避，投機交易毫無限制，今則惟由貿易而生的正當交易為可能。雖交易之自由並未完全取消，但較其程度不　雲泥之差。回顧自上海發生黑市以來三年半間，政府想盡辦法，維持匯價，終以無法杜絕套匯及阻止投機，不能竟其全功。最近中英美平準基金開始工作後，曾謠傳將統制買賣，然而中日資產未經凍結，則卽令統制實施，徒使黑市中再生黑市，不能完全填塞罅隙，識者思及上海匯市統制之匪易，冀求英美之凍結中日資金，如大旱之望雲霓。今獲實行，其裨補於上海匯市不可勝言，然而英美為顧全本身商業利益及國際關係，不能澈底厲行，則尚以為憾焉。</p>
<p>限制辦法</p>
<p>英美雖云凍結中日資金，但其方法與對歐洲各國者大異，尤其美國辦法更為鬆懈，僅能稱之為資金運用執照制度，決不能謂眞正的凍結，茲將兩國限制辦法解說如下：</p>
<p>美國凍結中國資金辦法，規定於實施訓令第五十八號及第五十九號中。前者規定准許買賣美匯的貿易性質：（一）須為善意的進出口，（二）不得為中國以外封鎖國家或其人民及東三省人民所經營或委託代管的貿易，住在中國者除外，（三）不得為有關中國以外封鎖國家或其人民及東三省人民利益的貿易，住在中國者除外。先就第一條件而論，所謂善意者，頗具伸縮性，究竟何者為善意，何者為惡意，甚難解說，若指供給日本軍需者為惡意，而日用品貿易為善意，則軍需與日用兩種物品本無顯然區別，不足以為識別標準，況善意進口商品，一轉手間仍可成為惡意者，判別更感混亂。故此一條件的不澈底甚為明顯；至於第二與第三條件，規定貿易經營者及得益者的性質，排除日本利用中國作為轉口地，固屬甚當，然而住在中國的封鎖國家人民除外，則日本人仍可利用中國作轉口地，亦屬彰彰甚明，故此二條件亦不足排除日本對美的間接貿易。第五十九號訓令中規定准許美匯交易的金融機關及准給美匯的貿易區域：前者指定為大通花旗等英美蘇荷各國銀行十四家，日本及軸心系銀行不在其內；後者指定為美國，美洲共和國，大英帝國，蘇聯，荷印等五區，日本及軸心國與其佔領區均不在內，此自發給照會者本意而言，無非欲維持對華貿易而斷絕對日及軸心的商業關係；然而上海本身已與日本經濟發生交流關係，美國卽令不與日本直接貿易，亦因上海的從中連絡，不能避免與日的間接貿易。所以綜觀美國限制辦法，除投機交易外，非惟奢侈品交易不受抑制，卽日本在滬的中繼貿易亦可暢行無阻。美國凍結辦法寬弛如斯，非吾人始料所及。</p>
<p>英國凍結在華資金辦法，在滬各英商銀行已於三十日接奉訓令，據匯豐銀行發表，凡中國國內各國所有或中國以外之分行華人所有之英鎊存款，債券及現金，悉應封存，惟對中國及英鎊集團區域的進出口貿易仍予資助，并得繼續進行某種匯兌交易。依此規定而言，非惟中國與英鎊區哉的貿易受嚴格的限制，卽在華各國人民的英鎊存款亦不能依匯率提取法幣，此較美國之單純限制投機而不凍結存款者，嚴厲多多，再觀日實際情形，進出口貿易的結售英匯均甚不易，英匯幾成有行無市的狀態，雖由不明詳細情形致此，但亦因限制嚴厲使然。較之美國，似覺差强人意。</p>
<p>凍結的影響</p>
<p>現在上海匯市以美匯為主，美國凍結辦法雖不甚澈底，但已是產生鉅大的影響。溯自民國二十七年三月發生外匯黑市以來，因貿易的入超日方的套取，資金的逃避及投機的盛行，平準匯價決非易事；中英平準基金曾因基金過少而遭失敗，國家喪失外匯不可勝計。歐戰發生以後，資金逃避之風稍戢，匯價得以穩定，然而上海游資充斥，雖免再有掀風作浪之日，中英美平匯基金雖得支撑難局於現時，但亦不能確保效果於將來。政府旣懼放棄黑市的後果，又苦無恒久維持的對策。放棄黑市則外商利益受損，邦交堪虞；特價飛騰，內地受其影響；限制供給則未獲外匯者，輾轉搜羅，必致再創黑市中的黑市，保全匯價猛縮。政府困厄於斯，故而遷移迄今，未曾確立恒久對策。然而此次英美兩國應中國的請求，實施資金凍結，中國似可得以確定其外匯政策。</p>
<p>上海匯市的最大禍患，即為資金逃避的可能與投機交易的猖獗。此次凍結辦法均已相當禁止二者活動。英國封鎖存款，限制貿易，固已嚴厲制止投機，無待再論；即美國准許提取美元存款的辦法，亦足促進在外資金的回流，在華各國人民提取其美元存款之際，僅按比率收取法幣，是即為出售美匯，換取法幣；從美匯方面言，為增加供給，在法幣方面言，為加强需要，為增加供給，當有裨益，況售出美匯，或有一部分為平準會所吸收，更足增强法幣的基礎，鞏固其信用；雖然凍結消息傳來以後，匯價曾見猛縮，今已縮在五元之內；但此實由浮空補進及進口商與假借名義的投機商猛扒所致，此後循規推行執照制度，結匯者須提示其貨物定單，則匯價當可平復。</p>
<p>且此次限給外匯辦法，與中國主動的外匯統制不同，如前所論，若政府視人視貨酌給外匯，則未獲外匯者，必以重價搜購外幣存款，而釀成另一黑市，然而此交凍結辦法限制外幣存款在其本國的使用，未能獲得正式准許的外匯者，即會搜購外幣存款，亦無用處；故凍結辦法的施行，實為中國解決在滬的外匯統制問題。</p>
<p>到於正當的國際貿易仍可通行無阻，日本雖得藉此相當套取英美商品，但上海物資亦可不虞缺乏。依理而言，上海特價不應過分高漲，但因囤積居奇者利用凍結消息，故意誇大其影響，致造成特價飛騰的現象，將來貿易恢復正常狀態，當有回平的希望。</p>
<p>進一步的希望</p>
<p>英美凍結中國資金，對於中國雖已有良好的影響，但究因限制過寬，未能獲得預料的效果；尤其美國限制辦法罅隙過大，不能竟其制裁之功。吾人在茲凍結實施之際，希望英美與中國政府密切合作，百尺竿頭更進一步，庶幾英美可達其制裁的目的，而中國亦得亨受凍結的全部效果。</p>
<p>然則進一步限制辦法維何？厥惟全部凍結中國資金資產，聽憑中國政府支配；放棄上海貿易，而移轉商業於自由中國而已。攷第一次歐戰時，英國曾有證券動員法的實施，即英國政府令人民登　其在美資金與資產，在必要之際，由政府出價收購，而政府即以其所得的人民資產出售於美國市塲，獲得美匯，以為購買美國軍需品之資，其裨益於英國的戰時經濟，至深且鉅。此次歐戰勃發以前，英國曾於一九三九年作月二十七日公布外國證券取締令，仍依前法，命令人民持有外國有價證券者，在一個月以內向英格蘭銀行登記，政府認為必要時，可以隨時强制收購，雖然英國政府因顧慮英國證券市塲的行市，未便隨意處分，但究竟賴此為抵押，獲得大批借款，其對於戰時經濟的貢獻，亦堪注視。中國戰事初起時，國人曾有倡議徵用在外資金與資產者；後在上海匯市維持困難之際，此議更囂　上；以為此用釜底抽薪的辦法，可以阻止資金逃避與投機，而避免匯市的動搖；然而當時因徵用外匯不合英美的通商自由原則，未克實行。現在局勢轉變，英美旣已凍結中國資金與資產，則何妨更進一步禁止外幣存款的提取與外國有價證券的移轉，令其盡歸中國政府支配；政府認為必要時，即以公債或法幣償付其代價而徵用其外匯。至其徵用代價，則應以其購匯當時的匯率折合償付之。如是則一方面可以打擊資本逃避者，消滅其不當利得；而另一方面則可以加强法幣基礎與其對外購買力，裨補於國家經濟。</p>
<p>再就貿易而言，此次限制辦法。仍不能阻止日本在滬套取軍需物資，已如上述；且因英美的凍結日本資金，而使上海加重負擔日本間接貿易的外匯，此實為不澈底之尤者。現在國際局勢動盪不定，上海與英美貿易關係不絕如縷，如果放大眼光，高瞻遠矚，則知上海貿易的中絕，實屬不可避免。英美誠能放棄目前上海微利，經營自由中國的貿易，非惟將來前途無量，且可立收制裁之效，故澈底凍結或嚴格限制貿易，實為吾人所最希望者。</p>
<p>雖然，英美顧慮國際局勢的劇變，與上海百年商業基礎的損傷，不欲使用嚴厲的制裁方法，激起下面衝突；然而南洋形勢日亟，已證綏靖的非是，早日制裁，即為速決的張本，澈底施行凍結，非僅中國受益而已也。</p>
<h3 id="c92">美苛禁油與日本作戰力 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 楊奉峨</p>
<p>石油是現代戰爭機構中的血液，但日本的作戰所需，却什九仰給美國與荷印。據「油與瓦斯」雜誌說：一九三九年份，日本的石油及其製品的消費共五八〇萬噸，但本國所產的不過四四萬噸，（其中還包括用進口油為原料的製品在內）僅佔七％；此外不足九三％的需要，全部依賴進口。當時美國供給他三五四萬噸，荷印供給他一六〇萬噸。此時美國已管理石油出口，但輸日仍若是之多；日本已竭盡其增產之力，但所得仍若是之寡；足見美國如果實行禁運油類至日，立可制日死命。現在美國已於八月一日正式下令禁止機器油等運往外國了，令文中雖未提及日本，但事實上顯係對日本而發。荷印亦於英美凍結日資金後把荷日油約廢除了；那末日本還能支持多少時期？這是一個有趣的問題。</p>
<p>平時消費的八八·六％仰給輸入</p>
<p>中日戰事一起，日本就停止發表石油的進口統計和國內生產情形，所以要攷察日本今日的供需實況是很難的。但是他平時的材料，也很夠我們參考。</p>
<p>日本石油會社根據昭和十一年份（一九三六年製）製成的一張日本石油供需統計表，至今還是公開發表的那些統計中最新的一種。他們把進口原油的精製品和國產原油精製品合稱為國產品，因之昭和十一年的日本石油供給總額內，國產的便估百分之四十三左右。事實上，國產原油及其製品合計也不過百分之十模樣，有如次表：</p>
<p>日本國產原油　一〇四、七五一</p>
<p>日本原油之製品　九九、三三</p>
<p>（A）小計　一〇四、〇七三</p>
<p>進口原油及製品　一、二四三、四六三</p>
<p>進口原油之日本製品　三四〇、四五二</p>
<p>（B）小計　一、五八三、九一五</p>
<p>以上總計　一、七八七、九八八</p>
<p>A佔總計百分率　二·四％</p>
<p>B佔總計百分率　八八·六％</p>
<p>（註）單位千介倫·據「內外石油統計」算出·每三百介倫合一噸。</p>
<p>這就是說：日本石油及其製品的自給率，對平時的需要量，不過佔一一·四％如果沒有進口，那末他的工廠機器·飛機·汽車·軍艦·輪船·漁船等等，在平時的狀態中，就要停歇其百分之八八·六，無法轉動。</p>
<p>戰時日本的石油進口</p>
<p>現代機械化軍隊需要更多的燃料。第一次世界大戰中，每個普通師團約當四千匹馬力，現在要抵到十八萬七千匹馬力；而每個機械化師團，則要抵二百五十萬至三百五十萬匹馬力。據法國報載：德軍侵法時，每個戰車師團每日消耗的油油達一千五百噸，每個空軍師團每日消耗的汽油達一千六百噸；因之全軍每天的汽油需要量達一萬八千至四萬噸之多。日軍的配備雖不及德軍，但是他載時的石油需要量必較平時激增，那是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>戰時日本石油的進口情形，如依美國方面的調査，略如下表：（單位美金千元）</p>
<p>這裏不僅指出了日本戰時對於石油需要增加之大，同時更明白指出了日本的石油需要，依賴於美國的比率竟然也可以增加。一般人很奇怪「美國於一九三八年六月中旬實施道德禁運時，為什麼不把作戰血液的石油同時禁運」？但是到了現在，這疑問似可不復存在。因為美國已開始禁油輸日了。而且在美國禁油輸日的前一天，荷印已把對日的油類協定廢止了。現在我們有許多理由可以相信美荷二國此次的禁油輸日，具有絕大的決心；除非我們的這種信心錯誤。否則無論日本或許尚有若干儲存，但可以推想得的：日本已到了「戰亦敗，不戰亦敗」的難關。因為他要戰，那末像他這樣貧乏的石油條件，實在不適於維持現代戰爭多久，如果他還想避免和美國正面衝突而實行拖，那正可以坐觀「經濟制裁」在時間演進中的偉大效果。</p>
<p>目前日本存油究有多少</p>
<p>據合衆社三日電，美海長諾克斯上校吿記者稱：渠猜想日本有一年至三年的油類及汽油之存儲，係為戰事而準備者，但渠稱，此係「純粹猜測」而已。我們再來觀察他的供給：據「油與瓦斯」雜誌統計一九三九年時是五百八十，民用計三百四十萬噸，軍用二百二十萬噸，共五百六十萬噸。兩數相差三十萬噸。則每年可能的儲存量，便不會超過此數。無論他怎樣積極的增產和節約，若照此存儲至少要二十年，繼能供給他像目前的消耗一年；所以諾氏的估計，並不太低。</p>

<p>政府於歲出超過歲入，財政收支不平衡時，往往以借款，發行庫券或發行公債彌補之。</p>
<p>不發債券之政府舉債曰借款，債券票面金額用外幣計算者曰金公債，用國幣計數者曰國幣公債，庫券係短期性質，期限約一年或五年，普通為一年，以本年度之稅收為擔保，本息每月平均提取。故有租稅證券之稱。我國於一二八前有庫券發行，經整理後，迄今尚無發行。公債則係長期性質，以長時期之國家收入為擔保，按期付息，歸還期限不一。</p>
<p>因財政收支不衡而發行之公債曰財政公債。在日本則曰赤字公債，因日政府於收支預算書上歲計虧絀之數以紅字書之，故以為名；而此名亦流用於我國，報章雜誌之論文上時有見之。我國過去發行之公債，大都為赤字公債，一二八後，財部整理發行數，延本付息，復經債權人等提出財部嗣後不能因收支不衡而發行公債，經財部通過，故國家槪算書上，一時無赤字公債之存在，其後又將前所發行之公債，經整理後而發行統一公債，按歸還期限之長短，分為甲，乙，丙，丁，戊五種，票面價分十元，一百元，一千元，及五千元等，共計總額十四萬六千萬元，即以之收回舊發行之各種公債與庫券。利率均為週息六厘，每半年付本息一次。</p>
<p>別於赤字公債者，則有　實業公債，為振新實業而發行；　鐵路公債，為建築鐵路而發行；　軍需公債，為購買軍需而發行；　國防公債，為充實國防而發行。</p>
<p>中國所發行之公債大都為長期公債，期限約自三十年至五十年。票面都屬無記名式，故可自由流通，外國尚有一種記名式公債，記名式債券如須讓渡，必須過戶；且有規定不得自由讓渡者。如於戰時發行記名公債，能達到有錢出錢之目的，蓋孰已購買，孰未購買，均有記錄；未經購買者，可向之勸募，藉以平均人民之負擔。</p>
<p>募集之方式，有自由的强制的，自由的由人民任意應募，都不記名，我國所發之公債皆是，强制的則强制攤派於民衆。有記名及不記名式。軍閥政府時代所發之債券，什九含强制性，北伐以後，則以任意應募為主。</p>
<p>公債之價格　公債之價格可分　票面價　市價　發行價。如某公債票面百元，以九八折發行，則票面價為一百元，發行價為九十八元，而市價則隨公債市塲買賣交易而決定，故市價變動不定。</p>
<p>公債到期付還之方式：</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>前已說過；波斯人大槪在公元六世紀時已竟會製造白沙糖，埃及人在公元八世紀時已竟曾製造冰糖。這種精煉蔗糖的技術在我國是什麼時候開端和怎樣進行了呢？糖霜譜上雖說有「甘蔗所在皆植」：獨福唐，四明，番禺，廣漢，遂將有「糖冰」而遂寗為冠」的話：我們可以斷定這「糖冰」就是那用蔗汗煎熬成的糖塊，絕不是現在我們所說的「冰糖」；不過那時製造出來的　霜已竟有「淺白色」的了，不能不說是製糖工業上的一種進步。糖霜譜又說：「宣和初——公元一一二〇左右——王　創應奉司……」。可是因為編簡的殘缺，我們不能知道那時出產的蔗糖果「奇」到什麼地步。要是按照法國大百科全書的話：我國是蒙古人在一二五〇年左右，——他們已滅了金國，征服了東歐，而建立了欽察汗國。——才從埃及聘請了製糖技師來以從事製糖工業的改進。這話大槪自有它的根據，不過從中史上不能證明罷了。淸初劉繼荘在所著廣陽雜記上說：「嘉靖以前，——一五二二年以前——世無白糖，（世字當然祗指中國）閩人所熬皆黑糖也。嘉靖中，一糖局，偶値屋瓦墮泥於漏斗中。視之：糖之在上者色白如霜，味甘美異於平日，中則黃糖，下則黑糖也。異之！遂取泥壓糖上，百試不爽。白糖自此始見於世。……」這樣看來，是我國人一直等到公元十六世紀中葉才會製造眞正的白沙糖了，比較起外國來要晚多少年啊？嚴格的說，這種「屋瓦墮泥」偶　而又偶然的事情，我不敢斷其必無！然而這十六世紀中葉已竟是我國海禁大開和葡萄牙人通商頻繁的時候了，——葡人於一五五七年已租得澳門——我老是疑惑我國這時製糖業的進步，就是不是直接從他們學來的法子</p>

<h3 id="c100">怎樣服侍小少爺 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 方修</p>
<p>希望貴家長注意</p>
<p>不知費了多少的情面和唇舌，終於我被一位父親的朋友介紹到一家「公館」裏去做「家庭敎師」；心裏很高興，但高興中却柔着害怕的成分，因爲我還是一個初出茅廬」的小伙子呢！而現在却要去敎四個孩子的書，從小學一年級的到初中二年級的程度，實在很費勁。</p>
<p>第二天，是「上任」的日子，我特地換了一雙「羅宋皮鞋」，冒着强烈的太陽，向「公館」走去。</p>
<p>走進公館的大門，便是一個天井，幾位「少爺」正在嘻嘻哈哈的溜跑冰鞋，見我來了都陌生地向我霎霎眼，然後又自管自的玩去了。一個最小的還將他的三輪脚踏車嘟嘟嘟的踏到我面前向我看看，然後才掉轉車屁股，滿意的開回去。穿過他們的「大操塲」，便是客堂了，我在客堂裏孤獨地坐了半個多鐘頭，「老爺」纔懶洋洋的一路伸懶腰仲出來了；帶着無氣力的沙沙聲，和我簡單的寒喧着，然後把他幾位少爺給我介紹了一下，便慨嘆地搖搖頭：「唉！不成器，不成器，都頑皮的了不得！以後要請先生多多的敎導敎導纔是。嚇！」</p>
<p>我謙虛地說了些客套話，覺得內衣都汗濕了。</p>
<p>第三天，因爲九點鐘就要上課，我纔七點三刻就跑去了，打算今天把他們的課程分配一下；誰知在客堂內等到十點鐘，還不見幾位少爺「駕到，」我眞有些發急，老實說一句，到現在早飯還沒吃過呢！旁邊一個娘姨向我說：「你下决來遲點好了，少爺每天要到十一點半才起來呢！晚上看戲到一點鈍才睡！」</p>
<p>十二時了，幾位「少爺」方才「大駕降臨，」最大的脚上還穿着溜冰鞋；第二個和第三個拿着檯球和板，一路拍進來；第四個仍舊騎着那輛車子，嘴裏還在咬着糖蓮子。「大隊人馬」，一路乒乒乓乓的「殺」進來，可是竟沒有一個帶書的，這眞叫我爲難了，拿什麼去敎這羣頑皮的孩子呢？於是我向他們問：「你們的書都沒買嗎？」</p>
<p>「書嗎？」最大的回答：「爸爸說遲幾天呢！」「那你們上學期讀的書呢？」「老早撕掉了！」「我還有一本呢！」一個小的說，隨即嘟嘟嘟的把車子從客堂裏踏進去，好一會又出來了，遞給我一本書，我接過翻開一看，天哪！原來是一本什麼俠的連環圖畫。</p>
<p>分班了。弄了好半天纔把他們的級决分好。可是那個大的却硬要讀初中三，並且還很響亮的說：「我上學期是初二呀！」</p>
<p>「我上學期是五年級呀！我現在要念初中一！」</p>
<p>「我是……呀」嘩啦，嘩啦，把我的頭腦都鬧昏了，結果把他們各升一級，纔都愉快而滿意的拉開嘴笑了。</p>
<p>「好了，現在我來試試你們的程度！」我說着就寫一個極簡單的字問那個最小的而要讀三年級的孩子，「道是什麼字？」他搖搖頭不耐煩地說：「你沒敎我呀！」然後冉問別的，四年級，初中一，初中二，三個都是同樣的回答，而且坐不到一刻鐘，就都溜出去玩耍去了。</p>
<p>書買來了。大的買了許多精裝的原版西書，和許多參攷辭典，小的除了課本外也買了許多小學升學指導，模範漢火詞典之類的東西，這眞使我頭痛，叫我一天三個鏡頭之內到底先敎那一樣好呢？</p>
<p>每天，老樣子，大少爺二少爺三少爺把那些厚厚的書本齊紥在一起，縛在四少爺的脚踏車後面的地下；由四少爺嘟嘟嘟的拖進「書房，」後面小的跟着大的走，到了星幾，便大伙兒往沙發上一倒，亂糟糟的坐在一起。於是大少爺便提出許多的問題來：「先有鷄還是先有蛋？」「放出來的屁，爲什麼是臭的？」「撒出來的糞爲什麼是黃的？」「……？」問不完的問題！二少爺和三少爺便吵着要我講笑話，說故事，還耍和他們比賽乒乓球！第四個呢？便拿出一些租來的速環圖畫耍我講給他聽，還要我和他比誰的手掌大，誰的腿細。……到了星期日，大的便拖着我上電影院，小的却又要我陪他逛公園……眞把我鬧得頭昏腦漲！但如果得罪了他們，馬上就把少爺脾氣使出來：「不上學了！」這對我是莫大的威脅！……</p>
<p>這樣一天一天的過去，行嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c101">談傭工介紹所 <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— 張國賢</p>
<p>一般薦頭店，現在都稱爲「傭工介紹所」了。</p>
<p>聽說：這傭工介紹所，對於傭工是越老越歡迎；所謂老也者，是老資格「老口」之講老了比較有能力得多。「原戶頭」銷路是最呆，因爲上海人家都用比較玲瓏點的，免得纏個不淸。「原戶頭」是却從鄕下來的，然而有些樸實人家却喜歡「原戶頭」，取其老實些，其實他們不久就可變爲「滑頭」的。</p>
<p>傭役介紹所，所得的介紹費，是隨着工錢比例計算，照最近他們公會的定章：大概僱主和被僱者各出二成，……上海人所謂最有「穿頭」的，則要算奶娘了。</p>
<p>編者按：據最近的市面：凡娘姨大姐工錢三元以上，介紹費每元東家出五角；下手（被僱者）二角半；另外還要保單費五角，（如用奶媽則爲二元）由東家付出。凡奶媽則先付工錢三月，介紹費每元計一元二角，下手六角。由此看來介紹所對於奶娘最爲歡迎。但介紹一個奶娘手續也很麻煩，有些東家是很認眞的，響如要奶娘騐身體，騐血，差一些的就不要。</p>
<p>在此人浮於事之秋，傭工介紹所可謂人才濟濟：然而一般中產之家主婦大都親自洗手作羹湯，請敎不起了。</p>
<p>這在介紹所看來，自然會影響着他們的營業的</p>
<p>不過呢，還是用不着人家擔心：好許多「老口」傭工，當他（或他）被介紹到東家去的時候，她會先問外快如何？看看東家的家寬大不？睏塲好不好？「稱工標準」如何？人多不多？一不如意，她竟然拍拍屁股就走；那時候介紹所當局還有一碗麵錢着落。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>「爸爸，現在你總可以放心了吧？從此我決不再做這樣的傻事，費了力又惹你生氣！」</p>
<p>「怕沒有這樣容易吧？」秋海棠是很知道那個尚老二在平空失去了這顆未來的搖錢樹以後會怎樣着惱的，因此心裏還覺得老大放不下，惟恐停一會孟掌櫃的跟尚老二兩個人要鬧上門來。</p>
<p>梅寶却一些不覺得有什麼可以担憂的，便很興奮地自去料理小狗子和他兄弟倆的飯食了。－這幾天田裏正在收棉花，他們要吃的東西都得歸她做好了送去。</p>
<p>直到晚上她跟秋海棠回進房去休息，她還是一個毫無心事的人。學戲的一件事，好像根本已經忘掉了。然而人的心有幾個能够像她這樣天眞無邪的，不然這世界上委實也要顯得太淸靜了！</p>
<p>她才走進孟家，便覺得情形有些不對。</p>
<p>「好，你來了嗎？」尚老二鐵靑着臉，第一個向她這樣說。</p>
<p>梅寶知道光是說話一定不成了，便立刻把孟家的小內掌櫃拉到一邊去，輕輕地告訴了她自己打算過幾天送十塊錢給尚老二的計劃；孟大嫂原也是個十足的外行，而且心性粗豪，聽了當然以爲很對。但尚老二却怎肯就把一塊到口的肥肉吐出來呢？</p>
<p>他堅持着不要一個錢，祇用許多極粗暴，極蠻橫的話威迫梅寶；－他簡直已變了另一個人－要她繼續跟自已學戲，同時孟老掌櫃的也在旁說了許多埋怨梅寶的話。梅寶雖然很淸楚地知道道是毫無憑據的事，而且當初又是孟大嫂起意把她拉過來的；但孟家三四個人都異口同聲的責備她不該毀的，她是一個十五歲的孩子，當然有口難分了。</p>
<p>大家足足議論了一個多鐘頭，梅寶担心他父親也許已醒過來了，祇得向孟大嫂哀求，希望他們過一天再談。（一八一）</p>

<h3 id="e1">US Secretary of State and British Ambassador Confer on Grave Situation in the Far East <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Australia Prepares to Mobilize 600,000 Soldiers</p>
<p>Cabinet Also Convened a Special Meeting Today</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (United Press) - British Ambassador to the U.S., Lord Halifax, yesterday conferred with Secretary of State Hull for 45 minutes regarding the Far Eastern situation. It is understood that the two also discussed the Soviet Union issue and the latter's supply problems, including the aid that Britain and the U.S. can provide to the Soviets. Dutch Minister Loudon also met with Hull, it is said.</p>
<p>Adelaide, 10th (United Press) - Australian Prime Minister Menzies yesterday requested that the Federal Cabinet convene an emergency meeting on Monday. It is believed that Menzies' request indicates that the government considers the situation in the Pacific has worsened.</p>
<p>Brisbane, 10th (United Press) - American cruisers that recently visited Australia yesterday sailed to "an undisclosed location."</p>
<p>Canberra, 10th (United Press) - The government reported yesterday that Australia has 600,000 soldiers ready for full mobilization. This number indicates that Australia has brought its national manpower under control, engaging in military service, war industries, and all aspects of society on a war footing, it is said.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 10th (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Menzies has suspended his tour of all parts of Australia due to the increasing tension in the Pacific situation and is scheduled to return here tonight. The cabinet will hold a special meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sydney, 10th (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Sir Stewart declared that the phenomenon of Japan's continued southward advance means the continuation of the tense situation. Japan once cried out about being encircled as an excuse to seize bases in Vietnam, and is now adopting the same pretext to cover its plan to expand its power to Thailand. Japan must know that the only encirclement it fears is the union of countries that feel threatened by its aggression, and Japan should bear the responsibility for causing this union. Japan can see from the warnings of the British Foreign Secretary and the U.S. Secretary of State that any action to encroach upon Thailand is a grave and direct threat to the interests of Britain and the United States, and will cause serious consequences. To avoid these consequences, Japan has full control, it is said.</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Situation Has Become Serious, British-Owned Japanese Nationals Prepare to Withdraw</p>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Haitong News Agency) - According to the London correspondent of a Swedish newspaper, in the view of British political and military figures, the Far Eastern crisis has entered its most serious period. The evacuation of Japanese nationals from Australia, India, and Burma sufficiently demonstrates the tension of the situation. Japanese shops in India have already begun to dismiss staff, preparing to close down. Japanese shipping companies and Japanese nationals in Australia, India, and Burma are eagerly booking passage back home. Regarding the results of the talks between Britain and the United States on the Far Eastern issue, London has not been able to obtain any fragmentary information. London officials are maintaining strict silence on this matter. The reason is obviously that British authorities have not yet contacted the representatives participating in the negotiations, so they have not yet learned of the results of the negotiations. London believes that the government does not need to maintain constant contact with the representatives participating in the negotiations, because the British representatives participating in the meeting are very capable, but the list of British representatives has not been disclosed. It is also impossible to know the whereabouts of President Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, in London at present, it is said.</p>
<p>Philippine Soldiers and Civilians Actively Prepare to Cope with Future Crisis</p>
<p>Manila, 10th (Reuters) - The seriousness of the situation is generally recognized, but the Philippines has not yet been disturbed by the future crisis on the surface. Military and civilian authorities are very active. Civil authorities are beginning to organize civil protection matters, such as stockpiling food, training residents, lighting control, air raid defense, and other matters. As for military plans, they concern U.S. policy and are not allowed to be disclosed. What is known is only the publicized methods. The most important of these is that the Philippine Army's regular and reserve soldiers will be incorporated into the U.S. Army at the end of this month, and the Philippine military camps will be taken over by the U.S. military on September 1. Communist members in the rural areas who were elected as mayors swore an oath when they first met with President Quezon, willing to jointly resist the almighty forces with the United States and the Philippines, and representatives of the Labour Party also made similar expressions to the U.S. military commander. From this, one can get a glimpse of the attitude of the Philippine people towards the situation. Recently, some Spanish and German people have applied for Philippine citizenship, but many people consider it suspicious, because many of them have relations with the Fascist Party. The local Civilian Liberties Union has requested all citizens to provide information on those applying for citizenship who are politically unqualified, and has requested the government and private institutions to eliminate employees with Axis and Fascist affiliations. Generally speaking, the public sentiment in Manila is now very calm. A trial air raid drill was held last week with good results. The newspapers unanimously support the U.S. Far East policy, and although they discuss the war in detail, they do not favor any side, but they do express sympathy for Britain. Since Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, public opinion has also had a good impression of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (United Press) - Secretary of State Hull said yesterday that it is too early to say what definite plans there are regarding finding a way to send ships to welcome overseas Chinese who urgently want to return to their country. He also said that what he discussed with Ambassador Nomura on Friday was the details regarding ships.</p>

<h3 id="e4">US to Implement Economic Sanctions Against Japan's Invasion of Thailand <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>If Japan Does Not Do This, the US May Provide Convenience</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (International News Service) - According to reliable sources here last night, if Japan attempts to invade again, especially if it infringes upon Thailand, the government plans to implement strict economic sanctions against Japan. The US will stop issuing permits for the free import of raw silk, unless the current tension in the Pacific is reduced. It is said that if the Japanese do not attack Thailand, the US government will consider resuming normal "peaceful trade" with Japan. The US will also allow the import of unrefined oil from before the war, and will allow the Japanese to purchase products from the Philippines. The US will not allow the Japanese to use the benefits of trade with the US to enhance their military establishment. This is the position adopted by the US government. What the United States fears most is that Japan will attack Singapore as an important step for the Axis powers to control the ocean. President Roosevelt has begun to prevent this. If the four major powers of the Far East, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, can unite in the Pacific, then Japan will never dare to fight, and war may be avoided as a result.</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (United Press) - Turin's "La Stampa" newspaper wrote in a commentary yesterday that if Britain thinks of undermining Thailand's territory, Japan will enter the war. The newspaper said, "Japan obviously will not be taken advantage of by other countries, especially since that country has now occupied bases in Vietnam and has direct contact with Thailand. If Britain thinks of invading this Asian nation in any way, Tokyo will intervene. After President Roosevelt and Churchill issued warnings of war, would they be willing to encounter a full-scale war in the Far East?"</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (United Press) - Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, wrote an article in the "Italian Daily" yesterday, accusing Britain of doing its best to expand the war, drawing Thailand and the Soviet Union into the Far Eastern war. He said, "The situation in Thailand, its complexity and danger, has been increasing day by day. Britain is applying political and military pressure on Thailand, and it is rumored that it has asked Thailand for the right to occupy important military bases in 'this neutral country.'" He also said, "The reason for Britain and the United States raising this demand is to claim that Thailand is threatened by Japan, but in reality, Britain intends to draw Thailand into its political system and into the vortex of war. However, Japan cannot maintain a passive and indifferent attitude towards this. Britain is hoping that Japan will make a natural and necessary retaliation for this, so that it can expand the conflict in the Far East," it is said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Haitong News Agency) - The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated that Japan will never allow Britain or the United States to undermine Thailand's independence. Any action taken by Britain and the United States against Thailand will be met with a response from Japan. The Thai government has recognized that Thai-Japanese cooperation is the only way to maintain the new order in the Far East.

This shows that the authorities are now carefully observing the overall situation, not slacking off in the slightest. According to a newspaper here, 25 Japanese military officers, traveling in eight large military aircraft, have landed at the Viangchan airfield on the northern border of Vietnam. This place is being rushed to build an aviation base. People here are paying close attention to this move.

<h3 id="e14">The International Situation Amidst the Churchill-Roosevelt Meeting <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The most noteworthy event in the international arena recently is not the urgency of the Far Eastern situation, nor the great battle between the Soviet Union and Germany in Ukraine, nor the rumor that German troops will occupy French West Africa via Spain, but the meeting between the British and American authorities that has been shrouded in speculation. The various situations listed above should indeed be recognized as important and have significance in influencing the future world situation, but they are all facts that have already developed or are developing. Their trends and changes are obvious. The talks between Britain and the United States are believed by everyone to be a fact and are certainly a major key to the future situation, but apart from some speculations or inferences, no official news has been revealed to the end. From this, one can realize that the significance is so great that it cannot be compared to the routine meetings such as those at the Brenner Pass. Since President Roosevelt set sail on a yacht on the 3rd of this month, his whereabouts have been kept secret, and for the first time, reporters were not allowed to accompany him. Then, Deputy Secretary of State Welles, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Marshal Stark and Arnold, the top leaders of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, all left the capital together. British Prime Minister Churchill, after US Special Envoy Hopkins flew away from the Soviet capital, mysteriously disappeared, and his whereabouts were unknown. He did not even attend the British Parliament's debate on the war situation. Now that the two have been away from their national capitals for a full week, and the meeting has become an open secret, the governments of both countries are still keeping tight-lipped and avoiding the issue as much as possible. Although this is the due prudence in wartime, it also shows that the nature of the meeting is extremely important. According to what the White House Secretary O'Leary announced at the beginning of Roosevelt's trip, today is the scheduled date for his return from his vacation. The issues to be discussed and decided should have come to an end after several days of discussion. According to yesterday's United Press London news, it is believed that from this week onwards, Japan will no longer be able to doubt the determination of the democratic countries. From this, one can probably get a glimpse of the results of this meeting.</p>
<p>Now let's turn to the current international situation. Summarizing the dynamics of all parties, it should be confirmed that the eve of the final settlement between aggression and anti-aggression is approaching, and it is also the period when the aggressors are trying their best to break out and save themselves from their misfortune. The Axis's launch of the invasion of the Soviet Union has trapped itself in a mire of prolonged bitter fighting, which once made its Far Eastern allies feel caught between a rock and a hard place. On the other hand, it has given the democratic countries more sufficient time to prepare. Objectively, it has also added the Soviet Union's vast manpower and material resources to the anti-aggression front. However, these are all the results of the failure of Britain's peaceful offensive and the failure of the blitzkrieg strategy against the Soviet Union, which Hitler did not expect. Unable to launch a full-scale offensive, it changed to a breakthrough in the middle and a sudden attack on Moscow. After encountering setbacks in Smolensk, it changed again and stepped up its invasion of Odessa. After such repeated changes in strategy, without asking how this will determine the fate of Ukraine, the reputation and vigor of the Panzer troops are no longer what they used to be. On land, the British army has not yet launched a counter-offensive, but in the air, Berlin has already tasted the taste of being attacked on two sides. If this situation continues to stalemate for another month or two, it will be difficult to say how the Nazis will maintain their rule. Therefore, Hitler cannot but seek a favorable way out other than stepping up the attack on the Soviet Union. The seriousness of the South Pacific crisis is certainly beneficial to the Axis. But while it still regards the attack on the Soviet Union as the most important task at present, it also needs to take action in other areas, especially the Atlantic, to contain Britain and the United States' active aid to the Soviet Union, and at the same time make the United States face the difficulty of dealing with both sides. This is the only assistance that the Nazis can provide to their Far Eastern allies when they are being "encircled." According to the analysis of the Reuters military commentator a few days ago, the Nazis still have such strength at this moment. The turmoil in the Vichy regime, the crisis in de Gaulle, and the instability of the situation in Iran should all be regarded as important parts of the current volatile international crisis. But the most dangerous and urgent place is still the Far East. Regardless of the true situation and development of the so-called "encirclement" or "counter-encirclement," the extension of the military base from the northern border of Vietnam to the Gulf of Siam, the reaffirmation of the tripartite alliance and the so-called "new order," and any expression that the "encirclement" is too small to make it turn back, all prove that the Far East is approaching a critical moment of transition from appeasement to decisive action when viewed in contrast with the parallel statements issued by Eden and Hull on the 6th of this month regarding the current situation in Thailand. If a new incident breaks out in the Far East, it is expected that the Axis powers in Europe will also do their best to engage in a last-ditch effort.</p>
<p>Comparing the current international lineups of the two sides, one side is a trapped beast fighting, and the other side is like a new sword being sharpened. Whether in terms of strength or situation, there is a huge disparity, and there is no possibility that the adventurer will succeed by chance. However, in the past, the democratic countries had weaknesses such as being passive, slow, indecisive, seeking temporary stability, and having uneven steps. This is probably where the aggressor front places a glimmer of hope. However, this situation is constantly changing, and no person or country can maintain the status quo forever. In the past month or so, one can see everywhere that the role of the democratic countries is undergoing a dramatic change. It is believed that this meeting between the British and American authorities is aimed at the entire international crisis, and they will pay special attention to the most tense places, and the arrival of a new segmented situation is probably not far away.</p>

<p>Washington Announces Transfer by British</p>
<p>British and Soviet Air Forces Jointly Bomb Berlin</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, Tenth: Authoritative sources stated yesterday that warplanes made in America are already en route to the Soviet Union. They also stated that the Defense Committee has completed its procedures for transporting medium bombers to the Soviet Union. This batch of warplanes was originally ordered by Britain, but Britain has agreed to transfer them to the Soviet Union. There are several hundred of these planes. The number being shipped this time is not known, and how they are being transported has not been explained in detail. They may be shipped on cargo ships sailing across the Pacific Ocean. Experts say that it is also possible to fly them from Alaska, across the Bering Strait, to bases in Siberia. It is said that the Soviet Union purchased this new batch of planes with cash. Soviet leaders told the United States that they were not concerned about military stockpiles being useless, but stated that the material losses suffered by both Germany and the Soviet Union were "considerable."</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, Tenth: A well-known Italian commentator, Malavoglia, declared yesterday in the "Forum" newspaper that the United States intends to acquire Vladivostok in exchange for aiding the Soviet Union against Germany. He said that Japan is currently closely monitoring developments in the Far East and will do everything possible to prevent the United States from acquiring this important base.</p>

<p>Reuters, Moscow, Tenth: Last night, German planes attempted to raid Moscow. Eight of them were shot down by Soviet forces.

<p>Britain Will Provide the Soviets with Photos of Bombing Targets</p>
<p>Reuters, London, Tenth: According to a dispatch from the Swedish capital, the Soviet planes that bombed Berlin on Thursday night were the same type of planes that flew over the Arctic before the war. A dispatch from the Daily Telegraph reported that Soviet planes carried incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs, fiercely bombing factories and power plants on the outskirts of Berlin. A total of three Soviet plane formations were involved in the attack, all four-engine heavy bombers. They took off from bases on the islands of Osel and Dago in the Baltic Sea off the coast of Estonia, completing a 1,200-mile round trip to Berlin without interception or loss. The report stated that the German side was trying to conceal the fact that the attackers of Berlin were Soviet planes, first claiming that the attackers were the British Air Force, and then claiming that the attack was only a German Air Force night exercise aimed at testing the effectiveness of new night air defense equipment. However, the German anti-aircraft artillery teams were caught off guard and did not have time to open fire, and the German night fighters took off too late and did not have time to intercept the Soviet bombers, indicating that the Soviet air raid was completely successful. A dispatch from the Swedish capital to the Daily Mail reported that the British had provided the Soviets with photos of Berlin's military targets taken by the British Air Force, and that the attack on Thursday night was the beginning of a joint large-scale British-Soviet air raid on Germany. According to a dispatch from Berlin to the Swedish newspaper Aftontidningen, the German side recently refuted the Soviet claim that Soviet bombers had reconnoitered German territory on Thursday night, saying that it was cloudy that night and reconnaissance was not possible. The dispatch did not specify which side's planes were involved in the attack on Berlin on Friday night, only stating that at least Berlin's anti-aircraft artillery did not open fire, and some planes flew to Berlin, but were prevented from dropping bombs.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Soviet and German Armies Stalemate on an 1,800-Mile Front; Fierce Battles Underway in Ukraine <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Moscow, Tenth: Yesterday, Soviet and German armies completed their seventh week of bloody fighting, with a stalemate on the 1,800-mile front. The German army concentrated its main forces in Ukraine and on the northwestern front lines of Kholm. The fiercest battles were in Ukraine, where Marshal Budyonny seems to have checked the German army in the areas of Korosten and Belaya Tserkov (the German side claims to have captured Korosten). According to news from the front lines, since the German 14th Panzer Division launched its offensive, it has caused the Soviet side to lose 150 tanks in two days of major battles. The Soviet high command stated that the German army's fierce attacks on Ukraine and Smolensk have not yielded any significant gains, and that many German tank and infantry divisions have lost 30% to 40% of their strength. These figures have been confirmed in captured German statistics.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, Tenth: A Soviet Information Bureau report released on the ninth stated that last night, our army engaged the enemy on the Kholm, Smolensk, Korosten, Belaya Tserkov, and Estonian fronts. There was only patrol activity in other areas. Our air force, in conjunction with the army, struck enemy mechanized units and infantry units, and bombed enemy airfields.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, Tenth: A Soviet Information Bureau report stated that fourteen German planes were destroyed yesterday, and our side lost twelve. In addition, the previous report of eighty-one German planes destroyed the day before yesterday and thirty-one the day before was incorrect. The Soviet Red Navy sank one enemy torpedo boat and destroyed two in the Baltic Sea, and bombarded enemy cargo ships.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, Tenth: A special communiqué from the German High Command announced news of a major defeat of the Soviet army, stating that the Soviet army southeast of Smolensk had been surrounded and destroyed, with 38,000 Soviet soldiers captured, and a large number of armored vehicles and artillery seized. In addition, the German army also captured Korosten in Ukraine. According to London sources, the German army's slight progress in southern Ukraine is probably aimed at the Black Sea port of Odessa. Apart from this, there have been no major changes along the entire front from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The German side makes no mention of its own losses, while the Soviet Union openly admits its losses, claiming 600,000 dead and wounded, indicating that the Soviet side is confident in the strength of its forces. The German army is facing increasing difficulties due to harassment by Soviet guerrillas and resistance from the Polish people. If Polish resistance to the German occupation forces spreads further, the German army's transportation through Poland to the Eastern Front will be greatly affected. The Finnish communiqué also echoed the German line, stating that military operations are proceeding according to plan, and that Soviet resistance is quite stubborn. Details of the fighting and locations are not announced to avoid providing information to the enemy. Soviet air force continues to be active, especially on the Finnish front lines, as Soviet planes have been transferred from bases in Estonia.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Soviet Guerrilla Units Active in the German Rear <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet side seems to have moved its troops and war materials from the ports of Estonia to other places by sea, as its land retreat route has been cut off by the German army. The German army is said to have already reached Taiba, to prevent the Soviet side from leaving troops in the Estonian maritime bases and continuing its guerrilla warfare elsewhere. The Finnish communiqué also stated that the Finnish army's attack on Soitelava is currently underway, attempting to find weaknesses in the defense line. There is nothing to report elsewhere except for fighting in Hango. The Soviet defense forces in Hango have probably received assistance from fresh troops transferred from Estonia. Although the German High Command announced that the battle near Smolensk has ended, details of guerrilla activity in the Belarusian province and the Far Eastern border continue to be transmitted to Moscow. The province is at least thirty miles behind Smolensk. According to a phone call from a Communist Party secretary in the province, guerrilla units are still active in the German rear, with units of hundreds of men, numbering in the thousands.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Many German Warships Destroyed in Six Weeks of War <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Red Fleet reported that, in a statement of a certain captain, that in the six weeks of war, many German warships were destroyed by Soviet warships and aircraft, including thirteen submarines, thirteen torpedo boats, three escort ships, one minesweeper, and over thirty transport ships. Germany, under attack from Britain, cannot move its larger warships to the Baltic Sea, and only a few submarines from Romania are concentrated in the Black Sea. Also, according to a message, as of August 4, a total of fourteen German submarines had been lost.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, Tenth: The Soviet guerrillas on the Northwest Front are extremely active, especially adept at night attacks. On the night of the seventh, a guerrilla unit raided a German headquarters, suddenly occupying it, obtaining a large number of documents and destroying two tanks.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Red Army Braves Fierce Charges on Southwest Front <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, Tenth: The Red Army fought bravely. Yesterday, on the Southwest Front, under heavy Romanian artillery fire, a Red Army soldier named Prusakov voluntarily sneaked into the enemy's lines, killing the enemy artillerymen with hand grenades, destroying four artillery pieces, and carrying several undamaged cannons back to the Soviet positions. Also, Red Army soldiers Boyekin and Nikolsky saw that their commander, Lysenko, was trapped in an enemy encirclement. They fearlessly charged into the enemy's lines with bayonets. Boyekin was unfortunately wounded, so Nikolsky fought alone, stabbing four enemy soldiers to death with his bayonet, and rescued his wounded comrade, carrying him back to their own positions.</p>

<p>Preparations for Invasion of Europe Intensifying; German Troops Rush to Norway as Reinforcements</p>
<p>Havas, Alexandria, Ninth: According to observations here, the British army will soon launch a large-scale offensive in the Near East. Recently, several convoys filled with military equipment, escorted by British naval and air forces, arrived here and turned toward the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, Tenth: The Business Week reported that the latest indication of British preparations to invade Europe is the Central Supply Committee's request to the U.S. Administration to prioritize the supply of tanks and bombers.</p>
<p>Reuters, Transvaal, Tenth: South African Prime Minister General Smuts stated in a speech here yesterday that a land invasion of Europe is currently necessary, but he is unable to confirm it. In his view, the air force's attack on Europe has already begun. This offensive will be carried out on a large scale, inflicting a fatal blow on the enemy. This could eliminate the need for a land invasion. Air superiority is the decisive factor in today's war. He believes that Britain will win, and South Africa will contribute to the final victory.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, Ninth: Military observers here are paying close attention to the news that the British and American navies will take military action in northern Norway and that American reinforcements have arrived in Iceland. A portion of the British garrison in Iceland has been replaced by American forces, which will reach 70,000 men. At the same time, airfields are being built to use the air force to assist the navy in patrolling the Atlantic. The German side has also been strengthening its defenses in northern Norway and rushing to build fortifications at the submarine base in Trondheim. German reinforcements are also rushing to Norway.</p>
<h3 id="e27">De Ru Attacks the Caucasus: Turkish General to Join the War <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>United Press International, Cairo, 10th: Yesterday it was reported that Hitler and his generals discussed launching a blitzkrieg across the Bosporus, through the Caucasus, to attack the southern flank of the Soviet forces. If they take this action, Turkey will join the war on the side of Britain and the Soviet Union. I have just returned from a three-week trip to Turkey and even went to the Bulgarian border. The military observers and officials I met and spoke with unanimously held the above view. I believe the Turkish government and army are eager to maintain neutrality and are determined to resist any aggression. The Soviet Union's resistance has sapped the spirit of Hitler's blitzkrieg tactics in the Eastern war, thus encouraging Turkey. The more firmly the Soviet Union resists, the more confident Turkey becomes in maintaining its neutrality. In my opinion, the Soviet Union's decision to resist has convinced Turkish public opinion that the British Empire will defeat the Axis powers. This optimism has also given hope to the invaded Balkan countries to rise up.</p>
<p>United Press International, Ankara, 10th: Diplomatic circles yesterday unanimously believed that the Anglo-German diplomatic and propaganda war in Turkey and Iran would reach a new peak by the end of August. It is widely believed that Turkey and Iran may become battlefields for Britain and Germany. Axis figures questioned Britain's reinforcement of troops in northeastern Iran and its preparation to attack northwestern Iran to establish contact with the Soviet Union. If the Soviet Union collapses, Britain can also assist in destroying the oil production centers of Beitum and Beigu. German propagandists are trying to incite Turkish people against British actions in Iran, promising that if the Soviet Union is defeated and Britain is forced to sue for peace, Germany will cede Beitum, Beigu, Georgia, and Azerbaijan to Turkey.</p>

<p>Havas, Brazilian Capital, 9th: The Neutrality Committee of the American countries held a meeting here today. The Chilean representative proposed expanding the territorial waters of the American republics from three miles to twelve miles from the coastline. The Uruguayan representative advocated expanding it to twenty-five miles. As a result of the vote, the representatives finally passed the proposal made by the Chilean representative.</p>

<h3 id="e30">An American Reporter in China Describes the Scenery of Hong Kong (Part 2) <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Scenery on the Border</p>
<p>The road from Happy Valley is a winding path that leads you through a mountain pass to the other side of Hong Kong. Below are many crescent-shaped coasts, but now the beaches are all equipped with barbed wire barriers. At both ends of the beach, there are hidden ammunition boxes that can fire directly onto the beach.</p>
<p>Behind the other coast, there is a golf course surrounding two bow-shaped lands. This golf course is situated on a green lawn between the mountain and the sea. Regardless of the weather, the British like to play here. Above the golf course, you can see the large houses that dominate Hong Kong from the mountain peaks. If you are dining in a large room that can accommodate fifty people, you can easily be shocked during the meal, as long as a six-inch shell is fired from a nearby battery, it can explode here immediately.</p>
<p>Across the bay to the New Territories, you can eat at a country store, which is a very magnificent Chinese temple, roofed with lead pipes, American-style. After the meal, people separately took four cars to the border. The British came to hunt, moving along the mountains in pink clothing. The car road passes through vegetable gardens and brown, barren mountain tops. Within half an hour, you have reached the border. On the other side of a small river and a row of barbed wire is the Japanese-controlled area. The border divides a main road in the village into two.</p>
<p>A Major Thoroughfare</p>
<p>Hong Kong is wealthy, and the symbol of wealth is the vast HSBC Bank, a white building topped with a skyscraper, dominating the entire Hong Kong. The bank paid out a dividend of $3.5 million this year. There are many other banks in Hong Kong: Hong Kong is the banking and insurance center of South China. You have never seen any factories manufacturing cement or firecrackers. However, foreign freighters load goods worth over $140 million each year. These freighters pass through the port and dock on the Wanchai side; the goods are then transshipped to various provinces in South China, the Indochinese Peninsula, the Philippines, Java, and other ports in the East. More than 3,500 ocean-going vessels enter and exit each year.</p>
<p>The war in China has forced millions of Chinese to seek refuge in Hong Kong and the New Territories. Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, it is generally believed that five hundred wealthy individuals have fled here for safety. If not millionaires, most are homeless and penniless refugees. Hong Kong has become the last place they can go. The terrible crowding is now making the residents of Hong Kong even poorer. People cannot rent a room, they only rent a corner of a room. In one room, ten to twelve people sleep at the same time in dim, unventilated cubicles separated by curtains, looking like dirty train bunks. The houses have dark, damp cement walls and floors, no gutters, and a greasy, narrow ladder leads to the mixed rooms. Beds are placed haphazardly on top of the ladder.</p>
<p>Defending Hong Kong</p>
<p>Last summer, the British government ordered women and children staying in Hong Kong to evacuate. Within forty-eight hours, three thousand women and children prepared to set sail for Australia. Only current caregivers can stay here. Most people believe that this sudden evacuation order had one purpose: to tell others that Hong Kong is prepared to deal with any attack. Since then, the British have laid mines in the harbor and straits, deployed submarine nets, built air-raid shelters, buried munitions, installed heavy artillery, searchlights, and anti-aircraft guns, and erected barbed wire on potential landing areas and roads across the island. They have stored a large amount of gasoline and food, and organized a people's volunteer army to assist the regular army.</p>
<p>Strategically, Hong Kong is not very important to Britain. However, it is very important to Britain's reputation in the East and is the last commercial base in China. Anyone who lives here for a few weeks can understand their policy. (The End)</p>
<p>Widespread extreme poverty in Hong Kong. This is a street where peddlers gather, and there is a hairdresser to comb their hair. Dirt, disease, and poverty are the fate of most Chinese people.</p>
<p>The mansions atop Hong Kong's mountains are extremely luxurious. The picture shows the private residence of Sir Robert Ho Tung.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Rumor of Secret German Troop Movements Advancing Southward Through Spain <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Objective is to Occupy French Dakar</p>
<p>British Authorities in Gibraltar are Consulting</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 10th: It was learned late last night in American diplomatic circles here that German troops have passed through Spain, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, and reached Morocco, and are now en route to Dakar. Just as the world's attention is focused on the Soviet-German war and the recent Japanese invasion of Vietnam, a German armored division, including 1,000 tanks and motorized vehicles, is rumored to have entered Morocco. According to observers here, this news is a secret action by Germany in response to the American occupation of Iceland, and to prevent the American occupation of Dakar. Washington officials declined to comment on this. It is claimed that President Roosevelt and the State Department have repeatedly warned Vichy and Portugal that any change in the status of Dakar and the Azores would be considered a serious military threat to the United States. However, if France and Portugal do not resist, the United States may not take any action against Germany. It is rumored that Spanish leader General Franco has agreed to cooperate with Germany in any actions against Dakar and French Morocco. It is also rumored that Germany has promised to give Spain a portion of French Northwest Africa in exchange.</p>
<p>International News Service, Vichy, 10th: The important cabinet meeting has been postponed. It is rumored that they will succumb to German pressure and allow Germany to use African bases, the most important of which are Dakar and Sablanca. Before the postponement of the cabinet meeting was announced, Vichy sent a note to the United States in response to America's concern over the colony. Although the content of the note has not been made public, it is expected to reiterate France's determination to defend its colonies against any aggression.</p>
<p>Reuters, Gibraltar, 10th: British Ambassador to Spain Hoare arrived here last night from Madrid and will consult with Gibraltar Governor Lord Gort here later this week.</p>
<p>Postponement of French Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Vichy, 9th: The Council of Ministers, originally scheduled to be held today, was generally regarded as extremely important given the presence here of General Weygand, the government's commissioner for North African territories, and the return of cabinet minister Darlan from Paris. However, the meeting was suddenly cancelled, and it is not expected to be convened before the 11th of this month. Therefore, the current situation is unlikely to become clear until after two or three days. At this time, due to official silence, it is extremely difficult to ascertain the future development of the situation. Darlan exchanged views with various cabinet members last night, and will continue to do so today. In general, a conclusion can be reached during the cabinet meeting. Political figures were very active today. Pétain continued to consult with Weygand and Darlan. The public gathered outside the head of state's residence, all wanting to catch a glimpse of the important figures. When Deputy Commissioner Pujol and Minister of Justice Barthélemy arrived at the entrance, the crowd cheered and paid their respects. Barthélemy went to the head of state's residence to discuss issues of international law, as France still wants to adhere to the French-German armistice agreement in both spirit and letter, and it is necessary to consult this expert on public law. General Weygand and Minister of the Army Huntziger did not leave the head of state's residence until the afternoon. The talk of a cabinet reshuffle that Parisian newspapers have been advocating in recent days has subsided today.</p>
<h3 id="e32">American Shipyard Workers Strike <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Philadelphia, 10th: A spokesman for the U.S. Navy said yesterday that work at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard has been greatly hampered by a strike. The strike involves 348 people, including many carpenters, who refused to comply with the notice issued by their national union regarding overtime and Saturday work conditions and did not come to the factory yesterday. The superintendent of the shipyard has reported the matter to the Maritime Department in Washington.</p>
<p>Reuters, Kearney, New Jersey, 10th: Workers at the Federal Shipbuilding Company, with the support of shipbuilding union president Green, continued their strike, causing work to stop. The Newark Evening News reported that, according to sources in Washington, the U.S. government is prepared to take over the shipyard at the request of industrial organization local congress Vice President Flynn. At the same time, work on aircraft worth $100 million undertaken by the Curtiss Company's New Jersey factory has almost completely stopped because workers in one part of the propeller manufacturing unit are demanding higher wages and two-thirds of them have gone on strike.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 10th: The Production Management Bureau yesterday placed all types of steel under full government control. Defense Priority Administrator Stettinius issued a control order due to the gradual shortage of certain steel products. All steel production must be prioritized for defense purposes and important decisions are made by the people. It also stipulates that steel mills must accept defense orders, and are not allowed to refuse even if it hinders non-defense orders. In addition to orders placed by the U.S. Army and Navy, orders from Britain or other countries under the Lend-Lease Act also have priority. From September 1, purchase orders for steel must be accompanied by a special form proving its use.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 10th: According to a Washington dispatch from CBS, many members of the U.S. Congress will soon travel to Iceland to inspect the new bases built by the United States in Newfoundland, Greenland, and Iceland.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 10th: A telegram from the President's yacht said that the yacht was anchored in fog and that the weather was not suitable for fishing yesterday. Everything on board is quiet and there is no special news.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 10th: Secretary of State Hull avoided answering reporters' questions yesterday about Roosevelt's whereabouts and the alleged meetings. As for the recent rumors of "Anglo-American talks" to warn against further Japanese aggression, Hull said that this issue has not yet been considered.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 10th: The general public is now planning to stop speculating about the mystery of Roosevelt and Churchill's meeting. However, high-level sources are increasingly convinced that the two are either in talks or will be meeting soon. Neither Washington nor London has denied the rumors, and the news censorship office has allowed most rumors to be published. The President himself has not mentioned the rumors. The general public speculates that Welles and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, and Air Force Chief of Staff Major General Arnold are all on the President's yacht meeting with senior British officials.</p>

<p>Axis Bases in North Africa Also Heavily Attacked by the British</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 10th: British Air Force fighters escorted bombers to northern France yesterday morning. Due to the clouds, it was impossible to see the targets, but military targets near Gravelines were bombed. British fighters engaged in dogfights with enemy fighters, and ten enemy planes were destroyed. The eleventh was destroyed by a British patrol plane near the French coast on Saturday afternoon. Ten British planes did not return. The British Air Ministry's intelligence department said that on Friday night, a British plane bombed two German supply ships in a Norwegian port north of Bergen. One of them was hit, and thick smoke rose. On Saturday evening, British fighters conducted offensive patrols over the Strait and northern France, destroying seven more enemy planes. Therefore, a total of eighteen enemy planes were destroyed on Saturday.</p>
<p>United Press International, Cairo, 10th: Heavy bombers of the Royal Air Force's Middle East Command heavily attacked Axis bases in Africa on Thursday evening, bombing the central church and embankment of Benghazi and causing fires in the Tripoli dock area. An official bulletin also stated that on Friday, a British bomber damaged a motor vehicle carrier in Bardia, killing and wounding a hundred enemy soldiers. During the German Air Force's attack on Alexandria on Thursday evening, a Junkers 88 German plane was shot down in combat. All British planes returned safely.</p>

<p>People Do Not Suffer the Misery of Displacement and Are Better Off Than Those in German Shelters</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 10th: The heavy bombing of Britain by German planes has never slowed down British production, nor has it crushed the British people's animosity toward the enemy. However, these air raids have cost the British government and people hundreds of millions of pounds. It is impossible for us to obtain a complete official figure. If the air raids of the coming winter are as fierce as those of last winter and spring, the amount of money spent by Britain to compensate for losses may be the same as the national debt. People here believe that Britain's method of compensating for destroyed houses and clothing with cash is better than Germany's method of collecting the homeless in specific shelters. Because such simple places inevitably cause pessimism among air raid victims, officials here who are responsible for compensating war damages have already felt that if they can pay out cash as soon as possible after the victims' applications are approved, the people will never be pessimistic or despairing. The experiences of many air raids in London have already shown that if people who have suffered from air raids are given money by the government to buy food and clothing, they can still be as calm as normal people.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Japanese Report British Warship Found in Gulf of Siam <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Believe the Warship's Purpose is to Demonstrate Against Thailand</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 10th: Both the Jiji Shinpo and the Kokumin Shinbun reported this morning that a reporter from a certain foreign news agency in Shanghai had heard that a British warship was found in the Gulf of Siam, and said that this ship must be the HMS Warspite, which was injured in the Battle of Narvik last year and is going to Singapore for repairs. It deliberately appeared in the Gulf of Siam in order to threaten Thailand, but the scars on the waterline of the ship are still visible. The Yomiuri Shimbun also carried this news and published a photo with the title "Cunning Britain's Threat to Thailand," and said that this ship was damaged by the Italian side in the Mediterranean and is now going to the United States for repairs. The Jiji Shinpo also mentioned that this ship may be destined for the United States, and the Japanese semi-official news agency broadcast that this ship was sailing from Manila to the west coast of the United States in order to repair it because Singapore does not have the necessary repair materials. The purpose of this ship's appearance in the Gulf of Siam is to demonstrate against Thailand, but it is heard that Thailand has decided to share the responsibility of establishing the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere with Japan. Japanese newspapers are now continuing to attack Britain and the United States by using the rumor of the British warship HMS Warspite appearing in the Gulf of Siam, accusing them of putting pressure on Thailand in order to encircle Japan. The Jiji Shinpo said that Thailand has a strong navy as its backing, so there is no danger of resisting Britain and the United States. Thailand's independence is necessary for the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>European War Talks (74)</p>
<h3 id="e39">Liaison Officer of the Democratic Front <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt dispatched special envoy Harry L. Hopkins to London in January of this year to meet with Winston Churchill to convey the U.S.'s intention to assist the democratic front. In July, he sent him to Moscow to meet with Stalin to convey the same mission and he may visit Chongqing in the future. This figure travels busily between the capitals of the democratic front, and can be described as a popular figure in international affairs. His background is introduced as follows:</p>
<p>Hopkins was initially not a prominent figure. However, he and President Roosevelt are close as family members. Among the thousands of officials under the President, none can compare to him. Others may hold high positions, be influential on the political stage, or have outstanding reputations in society, but Hopkins is the only guest besides the Roosevelt family who can stay at the "White House" for a long time. The close relationship between him and the President can be imagined.</p>
<p>The President sees guests from nine o'clock in the morning to nine o'clock in the evening every day, all of whom are prominent celebrities and outstanding politicians. But when he finishes his official business, closes the door to guests, and sits down to rest, the one who is qualified to have a heart-to-heart talk with him is his old friend Hopkins. The President and him are close friends, as close as father and son. But how did they get to this point? Hopkins is rich in understanding and good at being considerate. If the President has anything on his mind, he will not guess unless necessary, and once he guesses, he is right. Some compare him to the President's trusted confidant Corydon Meharry Howe, and there are indeed many similarities.</p>
<p>Experienced American politicians have great respect for Hopkins. When he first arrived in Washington in early 1933, people did not know his real name without an introduction. Even after learning about his origins, people simply regarded him as a follower of the President's "New Deal" movement.</p>
<p>At that time, the figures who planned the New Deal around Roosevelt had a so-called "brain trust," and people speculated about the members. Raymond Moley was one of them, and he was a famous individualist. In addition, Rexford Guy Tugwell was outstanding in character and beautiful in appearance. A.A. Berle (now Assistant Secretary of State) was dedicated and had the demeanor of a scholar.</p>
<p>As for Hopkins, he also has his strengths, but they are different in nature from the people mentioned above. Until he lived in the White House as the President's confidant, he always seemed unremarkable on the surface. His clothes could not hide his thin elbows and knees. He looked exactly like a farm boy singing ditties. If it weren't for his focused eyes and particularly long face, he would have no striking features. But perhaps because of these characteristics, he was able to fight his political enemies in three hundred rounds and recover his health from a near-death illness last year.</p>
<p>He has been unruly since his youth, but he is not reckless, and he is alert in dealing with matters, and sometimes uses spicy methods. It is no coincidence that he was recognized by the President, from a small social worker to a minister, to the President's most trusted advisor, and even a liaison officer for the countries of the democratic front related to the fate of the world.</p>
<p>Iowa is a place where talents emerge. Ambitious young people in the state all take New York as a place for development. Hopkins was born in Sioux City, Iowa, fifty years ago, into a poor family. After graduating from Grinnell College in Iowa, he went to New York to make a living like other Iowans. He first worked as an investigator for the "Poor Relief Association," the largest private charity in the country. At this time, due to his work, he discovered the contradictory phenomena in society, where the rich lived extravagantly and the poor could not guarantee their lives in the morning. He spontaneously developed infinite sympathy for the general poor, which was the cause of his later efforts in social relief work.</p>
<p>This young Iowan strives to improve himself in the new environment. In 1915, he became the director of the New York Children's Welfare Bureau, and was only twenty-five years old at this time. After 1922, he served as the executive director of the New York Tuberculosis Prevention Association. His scope of activities gradually expanded and attracted Roosevelt's attention. At that time, Roosevelt, the new Governor of New York, appointed him as the director of the New York State Temporary Emergency Relief Administration, and he was like a fish in water, able to give full play to his ambitions.</p>
<p>His work in New York was only a stepping stone to his later power in Washington. In May 1933, President Roosevelt took office and brought a group of talents to implement the "New Deal." Hopkins was summoned to the capital, and was just an unknown soldier among the various authorities. When President Roosevelt recommended him to the Senate Banking and Currency Committee as the director of the Federal Relief Bureau, the members of the Senate looked at each other in confusion about this unfamiliar name.

<p>Over One Hundred Health Clinics Established in China</p>
<p>New York News - The Board of Directors of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, in view of the growing expansion of its affairs, found it necessary to adjust internally and expand its organization in order to cope with the complex tasks and to increase the effectiveness of fundraising for aid to China. At the annual meeting of the Board of Directors last month, Director Meng Zhi and others proposed the addition of various standing committees and the expansion of the National Committee, among other suggestions. These proposals were deemed urgently needed and were unanimously approved. The American Bureau for Medical Aid to China is a leading organization in the United States for public support of China. It is believed that this adjustment and expansion will lead to significant progress in the future.</p>
<p>Strengthening Organization and Enhancing Power</p>
<p>The American Bureau for Medical Aid to China is a legally registered organization in New York State. Its internal organization originally consisted of the General Assembly, the Board of Directors, and the Executive Committee as its administrative system. After this reorganization, eight new standing committees were established, including Fundraising, Organization, Finance and Budget, Account Allocation, Procurement and Collection of Accounts, Medical Affairs, Community and Public Relations, and Administration. This aims to achieve the benefits of division of labor and cooperation. Furthermore, the original National Committee of the Aid to China Bureau, composed of national leaders who are enthusiastic about supporting China and sponsoring the organization, aims to assist in the development of the Aid to China movement. It is now planned to enrich and expand it to seek an unlimited increase in its power.</p>
<p>Aid to China Funds Exceed One Million</p>
<p>The American Bureau for Medical Aid to China was established in September 1937 and has been in existence for four years. Cash and medical supplies raised have exceeded one million US dollars in value. The United China Relief (composed of seven organizations including the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the China Emergency Relief Committee, the China Aid Council, the Committee for Relief of Chinese War Orphans, the Christian China Relief Committee, the Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, and the United Board for Christian Colleges in China) plans to donate five million yuan to the Aid to China Fund this year, with the Bureau undertaking 1.6 million yuan. Since its implementation, American oil magnate Rockefeller has donated US$50,000 in one instance, and a celebrity in Pennsylvania has also donated US$20,000. The total amount of donations received throughout the United States has now exceeded one million US dollars.</p>
<p>Health Clinics Established Successively in China</p>
<p>According to an announcement by the United China Relief, Ms. Chen, secretary to Madame Chiang Kai-shek, wrote to the Medical Aid to China Bureau, an important component of the Relief organization, stating that of the 150 health clinics currently funded by the Bureau, five, including Fuzichi and the northern bank of the Jialing River, have been completed. Madame Chiang Kai-shek personally visited and inspected the "Fuzichi" health clinic, the first to be completed near the New Life Movement headquarters in Chongqing, and photographed its interior and equipment for the Bureau. It is reported that "each of these health clinics, funded by the Medical Aid to China Bureau, employs 18 staff members, with monthly expenses of 3,560 Chinese currency. The equipment is complete, with pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and other rooms, and provides free medical treatment. Specialists are in charge of internal and external medicine, with particular attention paid to midwifery, vaccination, physical examinations for schoolchildren, and public health education.</p>
<p>US President Thanks Chinese Youth in Letter</p>
<p>It has also been learned that President Roosevelt recently sent a letter to Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, expressing his deep gratitude for the letter of thanks from 100,000 Chinese youth presented to him last month, expressing their gratitude for US aid to China. President Roosevelt said, "These young people are well aware of the problems faced by all nations that uphold international pacifism with justice. I am greatly excited by this. Your patriotic spirit deeply moves me. I am convinced that these young people, whether in times of peace or in the face of hardship and difficulty, will always cherish and uphold the torch of their ideals." President Roosevelt asked the Ambassador to convey this message to the youth, expressing his sincere gratitude for their thoughtful letter and signatures.</p>
<p>Organizing the Sino-British Development Association</p>
<p>London News - British Member of Parliament and Chairman of the Industrial Cooperatives Association, Barnes, announced at a well-attended Aid to China meeting that a Sino-British Development Association is being organized to assist the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives movement. This Sino-British Development Association has a strong Sino-British committee with various commercial and technical advisors, as well as representatives of shareholders. Barnes emphasized that this new association is a commercial enterprise, and every pound spent must earn one pound in return. The association's trade has been guaranteed by the Chinese government, and the current trade is mainly to purchase machinery for the "Industrial Cooperatives" or to provide loans to members. The association hopes to promote the import of Chinese goods into Britain. "Although the beginnings of this are small, I believe we have initiated some work that will affect workers worldwide, increasing economic reciprocity as the most solid foundation for peace."</p>
<h3 id="e41">The Coolidge Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The President Coolidge, the largest passenger ship of the American President Lines, which was requisitioned by the US Maritime Commission, has been out of service in the Far East for two months. After being requisitioned, the ship was docked in San Francisco awaiting reassignment. It is now learned that the ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today from Little Luzon via Hong Kong and return to San Francisco and Los Angeles on the 14th. However, due to encountering a hurricane en route, it will be delayed until tomorrow. Because the company maintains strict secrecy about the itinerary and ship names, the company claims that the exact time of arrival in Shanghai has not yet been telegraphed. The reason why the President Coolidge is resuming service to Shanghai is that it has a large deadweight tonnage, sufficient to accommodate a large amount of cargo. However, the right to command the voyage still belongs to the US Maritime Commission. This time, it is also carrying a large quantity of American wheat to Shanghai for disaster relief.</p>
<p>Bowen's Trip to the US May Have a Mission</p>
<p>Major Bowen, Chief of the Police of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, has applied for seven months' leave to visit his home in Canada. It is now confirmed that his application has been approved, and he was originally scheduled to travel to the US and return to Canada on the Nitta Maru on July 31. However, the trip has been postponed. It is reported that Bowen is expected to travel to the US on the returning President Coolidge from Hong Kong within days, stay briefly in the US, and then visit his home in Canada. His daughter will accompany him. However, Bowen's sudden application for leave to go to the US at a time when Shanghai's security is serious has aroused concern from all sectors. There are rumors that he has an important mission, which remains to be proven.</p>

<p>After the Mobil Oil Company's oil tanker Mei Yao, carrying 1,600 tins of gasoline, was forcibly confiscated by the Japanese on the pretext of supplying guerrillas, the company negotiated with the Customs. The US Consulate General in Shanghai has also reported the matter and is negotiating with the Japanese for its return. The gasoline was all supplied by the company for commercial use, so there is absolutely no reason for the Japanese to detain it.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Over One Hundred People Infected with True Cholera <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, epidemics have been rampant. According to statistics, as of now, there are a total of 148 cases of true cholera, of which 11 have died. 80 cases are in the International Settlement, 40 in the French Concession, and the remaining 28 in Hongkou, Nanshi, Zhabei, and other districts. The number of cholera cases in the Hongkou area is particularly high this year compared to previous years. It is reported that in addition to requiring people entering and leaving the area to be vaccinated, the Japanese are now implementing compulsory vaccination for all Chinese employed by Japanese. At the same time, all suspected infectious diseases will be investigated and diagnosed.</p>
<h3 id="e44">The Tji Baro Departed Yesterday; Dutch Nationals Evacuate by Ship <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Java Mail Vessels Have Not Received Suspension Orders; The Tjisadane Has Telegraphed to Cancel Service</p>
<p>The Dutch Java Mail Company's Tji Baro was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 5th of this month, but due to the need to transport a large number of passengers and cargo to various ports in Southeast Asia, and later due to a hurricane, it was delayed. The ship finally departed yesterday at 12:00 noon, heading for the Dutch East Indies via Xiamen and Hong Kong. It is carrying over 200 passengers, mostly Dutch nationals from Shanghai heading to the Dutch East Indies and on to Australia. At a time when the situation in the Dutch East Indies is tense, the Dutch Consulate General in Shanghai has issued a notice to register Dutch nationals, so all parties are paying attention to the evacuation of the Dutch. Regarding the Java Company's mail ships preparing to suspend service, although the company has not yet received formal orders, the company's Tjisadane has telegraphed to cancel its service to Shanghai. Whether the Tji Baro will still need to come to Shanghai after sailing to Southeast Asia cannot be confirmed by the company.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Increased Security in Both Settlements; Curfew Thoroughly Enforced <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Troops from Various Countries and Merchant Corps Deployed Yesterday; Unusually Strict Searches in the Western District</p>
<p>Since the authorities in both settlements began special security measures the day before yesterday, yesterday was the second day, and the precautionary measures were even stricter. The curfew was originally from 12:30 am to 6:00 am the next morning. However, normally, traffic was allowed around 4:00 am, effectively shortening the curfew. Now that special security measures are in place, pedestrians were not allowed to pass through both settlements after 4:00 am yesterday morning until after 5:00 am when they were allowed to move freely.</p>
<p>Troop Alert</p>
<p>In addition to preventing various gatherings and blockading some traffic, both settlements deployed all patrol teams, plainclothes teams, and car patrol teams to patrol and check pedestrians and vehicles along the way. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps on the International Settlement side also assisted in maintaining order. US troops guarded the area west of Yu Qiaqing Road and south of Robison Road, Italian troops protected the northern part of Robison Road and the extraterritorial road area. The British troops in the area east of Yu Qiaqing Road and west of the Bund were entirely responsible for security by the British members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.</p>
<p>Western District Defense</p>
<p>The authorities of the International Settlement, considering that the anniversary of the Shanghai War is approaching and fearing that criminals would cause trouble and disrupt public order, have increased security in the extraterritorial area. Yesterday, a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency personally inspected various places, such as Great Western Road, Hardoon Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Connaught Road, where barbed wire was placed, leaving only access for pedestrians. Seven or eight detectives, assisted by Italian soldiers, stood on both sides, strictly searching pedestrians and vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Another Hurricane Approaching Shanghai Rapidly <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Huangpu River Experiences Another High Tide; Humidity Begins to Decrease Yesterday</p>
<p>According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory, after the hurricane swept through the city and entered the Yellow Sea, it had generally approached Weihaiwei. Because the Japanese have stopped reporting meteorological information in North China, its exact coordinates are unknown. Another hurricane, which originated in the South Pacific, reached 26 degrees north latitude and 121.5 degrees east longitude at 2:00 pm yesterday, moving rapidly north. The city is again threatened.</p>
<p>Tidal Inundation</p>
<p>Also, at 3:00 pm yesterday, the high tide in the Huangpu River recurred. According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's prediction, the height was only 10 feet and 8 inches, but the actual height exceeded the prediction by more than a foot. The tide flooded the roads again from the sewers, especially at the corner of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, where the water accumulated more severely. Also, the water on the roads in western Shanghai yesterday had not yet receded. There is still a high tide today, and the roads will inevitably be flooded again.</p>
<p>House Collapse Causes Death</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that, according to information received yesterday, the hurricane caused considerable damage to houses in the International Settlement and western Shanghai. Countless trees were also blown down by the wind, and three people were killed and twelve injured. The ambulance service received twelve telephone calls and twelve reports of accidents and rushed to rescue the injured in the International Settlement. Three of the dead were women, one of whom was seriously injured when a house collapsed on Jiaxing Road, and the other died at 458 Ningguo Road. Another male died at 4:01 pm yesterday at Yejia浜 on Connaught Road when a house collapsed. At the time, one person was also injured. At 9:37 am yesterday, part of the house at 258 Tangshan Road suddenly collapsed, but fortunately no one was injured.</p>
<p>Humidity Record</p>
<p>Due to the wind and rain in the city yesterday, the air humidity increased. According to the Observatory records, it reached 100% on the 8th, and 94% to 100% on the 9th. Yesterday, it began to decrease to below 90%. The density of air humidity has exceeded the records of recent months, so attention should be paid to the mold and rot of goods stored in warehouses and stacking yards. Residents should also pay attention to health care.</p>
<h3 id="e47">China-America Radio Station Broadcasting as Usual <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The XMHA radio station (China-America Radio Station) of the China-America Radio Wireless Corporation in the city is known for its accurate news reports. The reports of Mr. Alcott in particular have won the trust of the general public in the city. Recently, due to the hurricane damage to the station's antenna, it is being repaired by craftsmen and will be temporarily suspended for a few days. However, recently, rumors have spread that the China-America Radio Station has been closed and will withdraw and no longer operate. According to the station's manager, Johnson, the rumor of withdrawal is completely untrue. We have no intention of abandoning the operation of the China-America Radio Station.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Shanghai in the Past Four Years: Development Under Abnormal Conditions <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Main Reason is Control by the Japanese; Ordinary People Suffer the Pain of Not Being Able to Survive</p>
<p>Economic expert Arles wrote an article in the English-language Greater Shanghai Weekly yesterday, reviewing Shanghai in the past four years, saying that Shanghai's commerce has developed under abnormal conditions for several months since the outbreak of the war. After four years, the abnormal situation is becoming more and more serious. It is almost impossible to incorporate it into the normal situation in the shortest possible time. The isolation of transportation in the past four years has made it more difficult for Shanghai to trade with the mainland than with foreign countries. Since some places were occupied by the Japanese, the boundaries are strict and there are many obstacles. In addition, in the past year, the Japanese have implemented strict control over import and export commodities, and import and export trade has almost lost its freedom. However, post-war Shanghai is still a paradise. However, due to the large population, public health problems have arisen, and the crime rate has also increased. In the past, Shanghai could obtain large quantities of cheap rice, cotton, and coal from the mainland. After the war, it had to purchase them from abroad. Therefore, the amount of wartime profits of industry and commerce is staggering, but the general public cannot survive.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The Two Students Interviewed Share Pitiful Backgrounds <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Unlimited Hidden Pain While Tears Flow; Mother Abandoned by Father and Endures Miserable Years</p>
<p>(1) Unfeeling Brother</p>
<p>"Boiling beans to burn beanstalks, beans weep in the pot;</p>
<p>Born of the same root, why so eager to harm each other?"</p>
<p>This is Cao Zijian's poem lamenting his predicament. Yesterday, I met one of the more than twenty applicants for financial aid. He shed tears and explained the reasons for his application, which could not but make me revisit this poem. At the same time, I couldn't control my boundless feelings of sympathy, but I couldn't help but place some hope in his brother's courage to change.</p>
<p>The father of this student applying for financial aid is old and unable to produce. He lives with his brother and sister-in-law. His brother's monthly income reaches more than 300 yuan. This monthly salary should not require him to apply for financial aid for his younger brother. His family has more than a dozen people. To be fair, in this tide of rising prices, with the burden of tuition fees for five or six children, his brother may not be able to cope with it easily, but he is certainly not in dire straits. Since he applied for financial aid, our assumption is that the student may have a hidden pain. The result of the conversation was unfortunately as expected. Originally, his elder brother, because of the heavy burden, put his younger brother first, and there was no way to pay his tuition fees. He only shed tears, and he never wanted to reveal the fact that his elder brother refused to pay the fees, but the fact still cannot be buried. I think similar facts are inevitable in all kinds of societies. We sympathize with the student's experience in seeking education, we expect his brother to sincerely reflect on himself, and we are willing to do our best for the student to ensure that his studies are not hindered.</p>
<p>(2) Unrighteous Father</p>
<p>"Only see the new person smile, never hear the old person cry."</p>
<p>She is a female student. Her father teaches in a certain place, but he disregards the lives of his wife and daughter, and has long been in love with someone else, allowing his weak wife and young daughter to be forced to come to Shanghai. Fortunately, his wife had received considerable education in her early years and found a teaching position in a primary school, maintaining the lives of her mother and daughter with a monthly salary of 40 to 50 yuan. For the sake of her daughter's future, she came to apply for financial aid. These past facts should be extremely painful for her mother and daughter! But her father, as an intellectual, is willing to abandon his wife and daughter. If he can sincerely condemn himself, he must feel deeply guilty. At the same time, we cannot help but feel ashamed of his role as a teacher of morality, but we still hope that the mistakes of gentlemen are like the eclipse of the sun and moon. If he can correct his mistakes, we will of course still look up to him.</p>
<p>After we have met with many young students, these impressions of unfortunate events in society cannot but emerge in our minds. We always feel that we hope to no longer hear these miserable voices, so as not to hurt the hearts of those young students. If we can save these students who are suffering and restore the happiness of their families, that would be "leaning on tiptoe and watching for it"! (N)</p>

<h3 id="e50">The V for Victory Movement Has Spread to Shanghai <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>In Addition to the V for Victory Movement, the "Happiness Chain" is Also Popular</p>
<p>Since British Prime Minister Churchill actively promoted the V for Victory movement, it has now expanded into a common victory symbol for democratic group countries. The Chinese communities in the city are now enthusiastically responding. This V is always visible on the main streets, occasionally with the Chinese characters "Resist and Build" or "Democratic Group". Yesterday, a foreign national in the city said that he admired the courage and enthusiasm of the Chinese youth and believed that the relationship between the ABCD group would become closer in the future. At the same time, the "Happiness Chain" has recently become popular, requiring recipients to rewrite nine copies and distribute them to friends. It is reported that this "Happiness Chain" is written in English and was initiated by Tagore Free People. It has spread to Shanghai via the Philippines and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wall Letters Found on Important Roads</p>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, huge red and black wall letters have been found on the main roads of the city, such as Nanjing Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Edward VII, Rue Say-Zoong, and the French Concession. In addition to the "V" character, there are also words such as "Victory in War", "Nation-Building Will Succeed", and "Final Victory", as well as the English letters "V ABCD", which are conspicuous and eye-catching. Passers-by stop to watch and are deeply excited.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Cooked Water Shops Request Reduced Water Fees <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Coal and Water Prices Have Increased Repeatedly Since the War; Maintaining the Original Selling Price is Difficult</p>
<p>Since the price of white coal and tap water has been repeatedly increased, the more than 500 cooked water shops in the city have suffered a serious blow. Cooked water is mostly supplied to the common people. In order to reduce the burden on the common people and to jointly suppress and stabilize prices, the Cooked Water Shop Association has strictly ordered that the selling price of cooked water must not be secretly increased. Fortunately, the cooked water shops in the city have been able to share this purpose and abide by the regulations. Now, because the tap water company has increased the tap water surcharge since July, the expenses of the cooked water shops have become more and more extensive, and it is becoming more and more difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Request for Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>It is reported that the owners of more than 500 cooked water shops in the city have been calling on the industry association, requesting that it negotiate with the tap water companies in the two settlements to provide tap water with preferential treatment in order to take care of the livelihood of the common people and to jointly assist the authorities in thoroughly suppressing and stabilizing prices, or to change the calculation method, or to exempt the surcharge in order to reduce costs and maintain the original price for the sale of cooked water. The committee members of the Cooked Water Shop Association, in view of the fact that the statements made by the members are true, are now secretly studying and discussing them.</p>
<p>Social Problems</p>
<p>According to the standing committee members of the association, Ji Jianming, Zhang Delong, and Ye Hanjun, speaking to a reporter from New Sound News Agency, the industry has closed down due to the difficulty of maintaining it due to the high price of coal and water after the war, which has led to four major social problems: (1) Due to the closure of cooked water shops, citizens must boil their own water. At a time when the population of the isolated island is dense and the houses are like pigeon cages, it is easy to cause fires. (2) The number of people who suffocate due to coal gas due to coal stoves burning day and night will increase. (3) The working class will inevitably drink more raw water, which is prone to disease and is related to hygiene. (4) Nearly 10,000 people in the city rely on cooked water shops for their livelihoods, and they will suffer unemployment due to the closure of the cooked water shops. Therefore, the above points cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Prisoner Commits Assault in Ward Road Prison <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Si, from Anhui, was sentenced to six years in prison for robbery and is serving his sentence in Ward Road Prison. According to prison rules, prisoners serving long sentences must do work, so he was assigned to the paper cutting department. At around 7:00 am on the 8th, prisoner Zhu and Liu Wenwu, from Shandong, who was sentenced to five years for abduction, had a quarrel over a trivial matter. Liu was assigned to manage the area near the department. He suspected that Zhu had told the Yindu on 63 Lane 3 Head about his bad words. Zhu then took a paper cutting knife and went to Liu to question him. When they disagreed, he stabbed Liu hard in the right abdomen with the knife. He fell to the ground in pain and called for help. Yindu No. 17 saw this and immediately caught Zhu, took the knife, and reported to the Western Warden. He telephoned the Huishan Police Station, and Chinese Detective Zhang Yunsheng came and took the prisoner Zhu to the police station. He hired a car to send the injured to the police hospital for treatment. Yesterday, he escorted the prisoner Zhu to a special court. The police lawyer detailed the case, saying that Liu's injuries were serious, and that several inches of his intestines had flowed out in the hospital, and that his life might be in danger. According to the testimony of Yindu No. 17, Zhu's confession was vague. Judge Huang ruled that he should be remanded in custody and re-examined at a later date.</p>

<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1686 yesterday stated, "The air route of the Dutch East Indies Airways from Saigon via Singapore to Batavia has been suspended.

<p>Combining Dredging Sources and Cracking Down on Hoarding</p>
<p>The person in charge of the French Concession Evaluation Committee said that the Committee will implement the established procedures to the fullest extent. However, all members of the Committee are doing their best, and they hope that the leaders of all industries in the city and insightful people will assist them in order to achieve great results.</p>
<p>Combining Symptoms and Root Causes</p>
<p>As for the measures to be taken to suppress and stabilize prices, the Committee has repeatedly discussed and agreed that the rise in prices is due to the manipulation and monopoly of bulk goods. If these people have ulterior motives and repeatedly wait for slight changes in the international situation, they will be active in the market, hoarding goods and raising prices for profit. Therefore, the only good policy to suppress and stabilize prices is to take effective measures that combine the symptoms and root causes. On the one hand, we must assist merchants in dredging the sources of goods, whether finished products or semi-finished products, in order to increase the number of spot goods in the market.</p>
<p>Cracking Down on Evil Practices</p>
<p>On the other hand, the evil practice of hoarding goods and raising prices must be thoroughly cracked down on. If we allow it to continue in the long run, the sources of domestic and foreign goods and raw materials will pour in, but the number of spot goods in the market of various industries will be difficult to increase. If the spot goods in the market are not abundant, people's hearts will inevitably be tight, and the selling prices of various items will continue to rise. Although the two authorities have issued repeated orders for this, these people still comply in appearance but oppose in their hearts and turn a blind eye. Therefore, the Committee will strictly crack down on the evil practice of hoarding and speculation.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Undertaking Overall Planning <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, since February of this year, after the source of Indian coal was cut off, Shanghai has faced problems such as coal shortages and reductions. Later, the Shanghai Power Company and other foreign merchants planned to charter ships to purchase coal from coal-producing areas, but this also failed. Subsequently, the Public Works Department negotiated with the Japanese side to solve this problem. Unexpectedly, just as this matter was underway, the United States and Britain froze Japanese assets, making it impossible to resolve this issue. Since assets have been frozen, it is impossible to purchase foreign coal, and this has a significant impact. Therefore, the Shanghai concession authorities are making an overall plan for the coal issue in order to find a solution. The Shanghai Power Company had an estimated reserve of 200,000 tons of coal last summer. When the source of Indian coal was cut off this year, it still had about 150,000 tons of coal. The monthly consumption is estimated at 50,000 tons, which can only last for three months. Later, the company tried to purchase some Indian coal and also shipped heavy oil (fuel oil) from the United States, so it has been maintained until now, with a reserve of about 100,000 tons of coal. Since the freeze order, Shanghai's industrial sector will inevitably reduce working hours due to this impact, and the demand for electricity will also decrease, so a major power outage crisis will not occur in the short term.</p>

<p>Jingzhi Girls' Middle School Donates Free School Places</p>
<p>Elementary School Students Should Use Slates and Slate Pencils</p>
<p>As of last night, the total amount of the newspaper's reader scholarship fund has exceeded the 40,000 yuan mark, which is gratifying since yesterday was a holiday and donations from all parties continued to pour in. The hurricane has passed, and the weather is cool and refreshing. The work of family visits for applicants and face-to-face interviews at the newspaper office was even more intense yesterday. This procedure has been completed by sixty to seventy percent and can be completed according to the scheduled plan. Then the review will begin, which can also be gratifying to the enthusiastic donors.</p>
<p>Jingzhi Girls' Middle School Sets Up Free Places</p>
<p>Jingzhi Girls' Primary and Secondary School on Chengdu Road and Foch Road is very supportive of the newspaper's scholarship program and has specifically set up twelve free places for the newspaper, namely two places each for grades five and six of primary school, two places for first grade of junior high school, one place each for second and third grade of junior high school, and one place each for first and second grade of senior high school. If students have excellent academic performance after enrollment, they may be rewarded separately in the second year. The school's kindness is deeply appreciated. The newspaper has specified the following methods: (1) Any female student who believes that her academic ability is adequate can write a letter stating her detailed academic qualifications and family situation without filling out an application form. (2) The school is scheduled to start classes on September 8. All applicants should send a letter before the 15th of this month. (3) Those who are qualified will be invited to the newspaper office for an interview. Those who are not qualified will not be replied to.</p>
<p>Cherish Material Resources and Reduce Burdens</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Wang Huifang says, "Your newspaper's initiation of the reader scholarship fund demonstrates the spirit of mutual assistance for the country, society, and humanity, which is admirable. I am sending one hundred yuan and soliciting one hundred yuan on behalf of Mr. Bai Ruixi. Please accept them. I have a humble opinion and wonder if it can be published. Elementary school students used to practice writing and arithmetic using slates and slate pencils, which was extremely economical. Now, they use paper notebooks, even foreign paper notebooks, which are expensive and consume a lot. The cost for one person is limited, but if we add up hundreds of thousands of elementary school students in Shanghai, the number is considerable. In my opinion, it is unavoidable for middle school and university students to use foreign paper notebooks, but elementary school students can save a lot. These are the words of an amateur. I wonder what educational experts think?" Mr. Wang's suggestion is worth studying, and it is published above.</p>
<p>Donations Exceed 500 Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Donations from all parties yesterday included 100 yuan from Mr. Wang Huifang, 100 yuan from Mr. Bai Ruixi, 50 yuan from Mr. Gao Weike, 200 yuan solicited by photographer Kang Zuyi (including 50 yuan from Erquan Shanren, 50 yuan from Jinlong Gauze Company, 60 yuan from Kang Zuyi, 10 yuan from Jiang Chuibing, 10 yuan from Hui Ying, 5 yuan each from Yan Bin, Zhou Yushu, Ye Jun, and Bu Changji), 30 yuan from Mr. Yang Yusheng, 17.30 yuan found by apprentice Wang Zengming from Shen Gui Ji Hardware Store on Beijing Road, 11 yuan found by apprentice Zou Xinshan from the same store, 5 yuan from Chen Shunde, 10 yuan from Yang Ji, 9 yuan from the 1941 class of Xiaoshi Middle School, 5 yuan from Rong Zhixuan, 5 yuan from Dr. Qu Liheng, 2 yuan from Xiangjun (abstaining from cigarettes for two days), and 2 yuan from Zhu Youdi.

<h3 id="e57">The Reason for Tedder Pang's Arrest <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Embezzlement of 2,000 Yuan in Public Funds; Unable to Post Bail, Thus Arrested Quickly</p>
<p>In addition to being suspected of selling military supplies, the reason for the arrest of Tedder Pang, acting executive officer of the U.S. Consular Court in China, was that he had embezzled 2,000 yuan in public funds, which was confirmed by prosecutor Sears of the agency. He was dismissed and arrested on the 8th. His vacancy was temporarily filled by Mrs. Ginggen, the secretary appointed by Mr. Sears. Mrs. Ginggen executed the arrest warrant ten minutes after being sworn into office. After Tedder Pang was arrested, the agency allowed him to post bail of 5,000 yuan, but because he did not have this amount of money, he had to be detained in the Ward Road prison. Although there is no definite date for the trial, the case has caused quite a stir among the American community. Tedder Pang previously arrested the "Slot Machine King" and brought him to justice for trial. Now, he himself is imprisoned. Tedder was originally a Shanghai correspondent for an American newspaper. Not long after arriving in Shanghai, he became a news broadcaster for the Greater America Radio Station. He was later dismissed for broadcasting beyond the scope. Later, he replaced Mr. Bertelsen as acting executive officer. One of his feet is slightly lame because he was shot in the leg while fighting with bandits when he served in the Chicago Police Department. Mr. Deng, the American judge in China, has refused to comment on the development of the case. The American community hopes that Mr. Haermick, the U.S. Consular Judge in China, can come to China from the United States as soon as possible to handle the case personally.</p>

<p>Their former status was quite high, and their income was also quite good. Now, they still hold meager salaries and have to maintain this high standard of living. Due to their status and face, they are embarrassed to ask others for help. It is spicy in their mouths, bitter in their hearts. In this vast city, how many people of this class are there?</p>
<p>The old lawyer who rents a room upstairs in a Chinese medicine store in the western district of the French Concession is one such person. He now earns less than 200 yuan a month, maintaining a family of six, and is also responsible for the tuition fees of two daughters. Generally speaking, it does not seem very difficult. However, he is a poor scholar. Although he has a very long history in the judicial field, his hair is now gray, and the result is that his sleeves are empty. His eldest daughter has gone to apply for the Shu Ping Scholarship, and his second daughter has applied to this newspaper. Listening to his calm and slightly sighing tone, I can't help but feel infinite sympathy. (T)</p>
<p>Tragic Experiences</p>
<p>Yuan Xingzun is an eighteen-year-old young man from Wujin, Jiangsu. He wrote his brief history on the application form: "Graduated from Lufei Lane Primary School in Nanjing, entered the Second Municipal Middle School. The August 13th incident occurred, and he dropped out of school for a year. He came to Shanghai to take refuge. He completed junior high school at Southern Middle School. Due to a serious illness, he was idle for half a year. After recovering, he transferred to Huiling Middle School, first year of senior high school." He also wrote next to the form: "The family situation is extremely miserable. Please allow me to present it in person." His academic performance has not been affected by his experiences, and he has also received four certificates of merit. His conduct is also rated as "A."</p>
<p>Because his family members are not in Shanghai, and he is the only one living in the school dormitory, we invited him to the office for a face-to-face interview. He arrived on time, carrying a book. An old blue cloth gown reflected his thin face, making him look even more haggard. He said: "My father used to work in the archives department of the Ministry of Finance, responsible for keeping files. After the August 13th incident, he was transferred to Hankou. At this time, my mother unfortunately passed away in Nanjing. My two younger sisters and I followed my grandfather and maternal great-aunt to Changzhou. Unfortunately, our ancestral home was bombed, and we had nowhere to live. We then went to the countryside, relying on relatives and friends for support. We only came to Shanghai in the 28th year. We didn't know that my grandfather passed away this year, and the family situation deteriorated. My maternal great-aunt also passed away soon after. By the time the funeral was over, we were already heavily in debt. Due to the heavy blows, I suffered a serious illness last year, and my two younger sisters dropped out of school." Speaking of this, he couldn't help but shed tears. After a while, he pressed his book with his hand and continued: "Because my father's income is not enough to subsidize the family, my two younger sisters have to live in relatives' homes. My food and lodging depend on borrowing and pawning, but there are not many places where I can borrow money and many things that I can pawn!" His voice gradually lowered. After thinking for a while, he said, "The cost of my grandfather's temporary coffin has been owed for two years. I don't know what to do with my mother's coffin?" He turned his tone to himself with great sadness and sighed for his future: "What if I graduate from middle school?" The reporter sympathized with him, comforted him, and encouraged him: "A young man should not be so depressed, but should cheer up!" He became excited, "If I can get the Shenbao scholarship to continue my studies, my happiness will surpass everything, and I will never forget it!" He said goodbye to me with eager expectations.

It was already dusk when the event ended. Yesterday, at the end of the first set of volleyball, a match ball auction was held. The result was that Mr. Ma Guanliang, a great philanthropist, bought it for 500 yuan. When the final match was about to start, a basketball charity sale was held.

<p>— Yuan Shanzheng</p>
<p>(4) Classification Research: The classification of plants is an important task in the study of botany. After studying plant morphology, we can begin to study taxonomy. The method of research is to collect various fully developed plants, use a key, and compare them with specimens, proceeding step by step without error. Then, we can determine the family and genus of the plant. As for the characteristics of each category, they are summarized by scientists from the morphological properties of many plants. Except for extremely important categories, it is not necessary to memorize them strongly.</p>
<p>(5) Precise Records: After carefully observing the morphology and growth of a plant and determining its category, we record it in writing or drawing for future reference. 1. For written records, it is best to create a table, dividing it into sections for roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds, filling in the information accurately in order. 2. Drawing method: A. First, carefully observe the plant clearly, then lightly divide it into several areas with a pencil according to the plant's structure, drawing step by step from left to right or from top to bottom of the paper. Once it is accurately depicted, deepen the pencil lines. B. Draw on one side of the paper, arranging the drawings evenly. C. Divide the drawings into three types: one is a realistic drawing, two is a schematic drawing, and three is a detailed drawing. D. The lines drawn must be smooth and continuous, and corners and circumferences must also be connected and closely joined. E. Indicate the type of drawing below the drawing, and label each part of the drawing. The lines used for labeling should be straight and should never intersect.</p>
<p>(6) Making Specimens: Because written or drawn records are sometimes not as accurate as the real thing, after collecting specimens, we take all or a part of them and make them into specimens for research and to aid memory. The most common method is pressing specimens. Other types include various leaf specimens, fruit specimens, and root specimens, for the purpose of studying morphology.</p>
<p>(7) Reading Outline: For beginners, the most troublesome thing about botany is that it is not easy to memorize. If we use the above methods to study diligently, it will be easy to remember. Reference books and textbooks are also tools for studying. After reading and understanding them, we extract the key points and create a table, so that the organization is clear and easy to understand at a glance. This makes it easier to remember and saves time and energy in reviewing.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Ways to Beat the Heat <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>In recent days, the fiery sun has been blazing, the asphalt roads are soft and melting, and the roadside trees are lush and green. The loud chirping of cicadas and the calls of ice and melon vendors weave together a picture of high summer. Wave after wave of heat assaults everyone on this isolated island, and the cry of "Hot! Hot!" echoes in everyone's mouth. Indeed, the mercury in the thermometer has approached the hundred-degree mark, and the soaring prices on the isolated island have also reached boiling point, seemingly echoing the climate of these past few days. Therefore, the people living on this isolated island, under the oppression of these dual forces, are truly suffocating, as if they have fallen into the depths of fiery hell. But life must go on! Thus, "beating the heat" has imperceptibly become the newest phrase. In this fiery hot place, how can one comfortably while away the long summer? But methods of beating the heat vary. Before the war, one could go to Lushan, Qingdao, or Moganshan to escape the heat. Now, with every step fraught with difficulty, one can only shrink onto this isolated island to spend this long summer. There are two ways to beat the heat:</p>
<p>(1) Material Ways to Beat the Heat: Watermelon, frozen desserts, soda, shaved ice, orange juice, etc., have become wonderful products for beating the heat. Watermelon can quench thirst and promote urination. It is a natural domestic cold food and has always been the most popular in summer. However, before the war, watermelon was for everyone. Now, watermelon prices are too expensive, and only the wealthy class can enjoy it to the fullest. Frozen desserts and orange juice, which cool one to the core, are also excellent ways to beat the heat. Their flavors are completely different from watermelon, and each has its own merits. Nowadays, popsicles have replaced watermelon and become a popular cold drink. They are cold and sweet, but unfortunately, they are not as nutritious as watermelon and frozen desserts. Swimming is a very good summer sport, but now one cannot go to the seaside and can only squeeze into those small artificial swimming pools. But it does have some benefits for physical health. Some people have nothing to do at night and go to air-conditioned dance halls to sit for a while, which is also a special way to beat the heat.</p>
<p>(2) Spiritual Ways to Beat the Heat: Summer is hot, and one has no heart to do anything. It is best to have a book in hand and read various novels and miscellaneous books that one loves, or various magazines such as "Xifeng," "Wanhxiang," "Xiaoshuo Yuebao," "Le Guan," and "Yongan," lying on a cool mat to while away half a day. Adding some spiritual food and turning on the radio to listen to music and songs will naturally calm one's mind and make one feel cooler, and one will not feel the heat. If one has nothing to do and is idle all day, one will feel restless and feverish, and one will feel the heat even more oppressive. Some people seek improper entertainment to stimulate the spirit, which eventually makes them depressed. This is not the right way to beat the heat, so you must choose the right way to beat the heat.</p>
<h3 id="e79">A Casual Discussion on Beating the Heat <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Yaming</p>
<p>Talking about beating the heat in Shanghai, this metropolis, first requires careful consideration, because in the city, unlike in a summer resort, there are all kinds of environmental limitations.</p>
<p>However, I think that if we can use our brains a little, beating the heat will not become a problem. I think the greatest purpose of beating the heat is to spend the summer under hygienic and healthy conditions. Then, one must ask you, do you prefer to use dynamic methods or static methods?</p>
<p>If you prefer to use dynamic methods, then although you cannot take a boat to your summer resort, you can take a double-decker bus for a ride around the city. Although you cannot climb Mogan Mountain, you can walk to the top of a nine-story building for a panoramic view. Although you cannot stroll on the beach, you can wander under the shade of lush greenery, which can all make your body and mind comfortable. Moreover, there are so many places to go.</p>
<p>Even at home, you can prepare various summer drinks and do housework that you have never done before, so you can get new interest.</p>
<p>If you prefer static methods, then you can listen to your favorite programs on the radio, pick out a few books written by your favorite authors and read them. You can collect and browse landscape pictures from all over the world. The snow-capped mountains of Switzerland and the snow scenes of the Alps are like a refreshing medicine that can make you feel cool all over. The scenic spots of various countries can bring your thoughts to those places worth staying in.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can study chess, Go, Xiangqi (Chinese chess), and the chess pieces popular in Europe and America. Or, engage in stamp collecting, or create some handicrafts, or engage in drawing. Any method that can make you use your brain can make your body calm, which meets your needs and avoids the heat. Experts in recreation say that if you have proper recreation, you can be happy. Be Happy with A. Hobby. In fact, these recreations are still excellent ways to beat the heat.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Hong Kong's "Snow" <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— San San</p>
<p>Hong Kong never snows all year round.</p>
<p>In the summer, when you walk on the streets of Hong Kong, you can also see some shops with a large (usually red) box with a large white character "雪" (snow) written on it. You should know that what is stored inside is not "compressed snow blocks" of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide), but transparent, very hard, meltable -- actually "artificial ice"! This kind of "snow" is transported daily from the "ice factory" to the above-mentioned distribution points, sawed open, and sold to chefs and peddlers who run cold drink stalls.</p>
<p>If you point to it and say to the Cantonese, "This is ice, not snow," they will definitely argue with you and insist that "係雪" ("係" means "is" in Cantonese, pronounced 　　). Therefore, Cantonese people who grow up in Hong Kong do not know snow. In general, elementary school students only stare wide-eyed when they see drawings of hexagonal snowflakes under a magnifying glass in textbooks. If they encounter a teacher with less experience, they will also talk nonsense for a while...</p>
<p>I remember that Hong Kong had a heavy snowfall once last year. This time, I think Hong Kong people probably recognize real "snow" now?</p>

<h3 id="e82">Idle Talk about Watermelon <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Qi</p>
<p>When the cries of "Yangmei black Yangmei" disappear from the alleys, what replaces them is "Watermelon, watermelon, Tiger Yellow watermelon." So let's talk about watermelon.</p>
<p>Watermelon is also known as cold melon, presumably because of its cold nature. It is commonly called watermelon because it comes from the Western Regions and is transplanted to China, hence the name watermelon.</p>
<p>According to the history of the Five Dynasties, the watermelon was transplanted to China when Hu Han brought back melon seeds from the Khitans during the Five Dynasties (according to modern Hami County, Xinjiang, because there are many fertile fields and sweet springs nearby, the Hami melons produced are still famous). He mixed the seeds with cow dung, and the melons that grew were large and sweet, named watermelon. According to this, watermelon was a native product of the Khitans and was only introduced to China during the Five Dynasties. Another saying is that watermelon was originally produced in eastern Zhejiang, especially those produced in Yongjia, and gradually spread throughout the country. In my humble opinion, the former is more credible.</p>
<p>Today, the production of watermelon is most prevalent in Jiangnan. The Three Whites of Pinghu and the Tiger Yellows of Sanlintang in Pudong are all juicy and sweet, so they have long been famous throughout the region. Now, Pinghu and Sanlintang have become things of the past. At this time when rice is as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon, the terror of food and clothing is tightly gripping the throats of farmers. It is natural for melon fields to be turned into rice fields. Even if some are occasionally planted, the countryside cannot sell them for a good price. If they are transported to Shanghai, they must be subjected to heavy taxes. Sometimes, the melons in the melon fields are often forcibly eaten for no reason.</p>
<p>The price of watermelons this year is truly beyond the dreams of us poor folks, but I dare to believe that next year today, we can often enjoy the Tiger Yellow and Three White watermelons to our heart's content.</p>

<h3 id="e84">From Using Reading to Beat the Heat to Methods of Reading <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Summer days are long, making it the best season for reading. Although those who feel interested in reading are extremely increasing their reading enjoyment in every season.</p>
<p>However, one must have appropriate methods for reading in order to truly benefit from reading. According to the young American philosopher Adler - who is a dedicated promoter of the Renaissance at the University of Chicago and has great prestige in the American reading community - the best method for reading is to utilize writing. The following is his theory and method.</p>
<p>Buying a book is only the prologue to owning the book. Unless you transform the material in the book into a part of yourself, you cannot actually say that you own that book. If you want to absorb the material in the book, then you need to do some writing. This kind of writing has several advantages:</p>
<p>1. It can keep you alert while reading.</p>
<p>2. Because true reading is really the work of thought, and thought needs to be expressed through writing or speaking.</p>
<p>3. After the work of writing, you can put the material from the book into your mind, so that you are facing the author and having the most congenial conversation, which is the greatest joy of reading.</p>
<p>Of course, this refers to books that require more thought or seek to answer questions. Ordinary novels and leisure books, aimed at whiling away the time, can be read casually.</p>
<p>As for reading with writing methods, it can be divided into several types:</p>
<p>1. Use underlining to highlight the important parts of the text.</p>
<p>2. Draw lines next to the text, that is, in the blank spaces of the book.</p>
<p>3. Use asterisks or other symbols to mark important places, so that you can immediately see the important parts when you flip through them in the future.</p>
<p>4. Write numbers in the blank spaces next to the text, so that the important points of the whole book are recorded in order.</p>
<p>5. Write page numbers next to the text to indicate that there is an equal discussion on a certain page.</p>
<p>6. Circle the important words and phrases.</p>
<p>7. Write your own questions in the blank spaces, and add the answers if possible. After this work, not only does the material in the book become a part of you, but even your book, because you have spent so much effort on it, you are unwilling to lend it out easily, and you want it to always be your possession. ·Li Sihua·</p>
<h3 id="e85">Ten Summer Pleasures <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Nianyun</p>
<p>The sun is blazing, and the heat is oppressive. Confined in a small room, I feel bored and listless. But others may feel so, but I do not. Because the pleasures of the world are truly boundless, and those who understand can get them. Therefore, I have created ten summer pleasures.</p>
<p>Get up before dawn, go to the sun deck to watch the sunrise, or stroll on the street to breathe fresh air: at this time, the gentle breeze caresses my face, making my heart feel refreshed, this is the first pleasure.</p>
<p>Fill several empty glass bottles with plain boiled water and put them in the water tank to serve as a drink for the day. It is clear and clean, can quench thirst, and is economical and hygienic, this is the second pleasure.</p>
<p>After breakfast, read the newspaper, big or small, take it all in. If there is a work that pleases me, I recite it three times. It increases my knowledge and my intelligence, this is the third pleasure.</p>
<p>Go out to work, walking slowly, again and again, humming a marching song. Although the journey is long, I do not feel it is bitter, this is the fourth pleasure.</p>
<p>After lunch, when the sun is high in the sky, steal some leisure from the busy schedule and take a short rest, half asleep and half awake, calm my mind, put everything aside, feel relaxed all over, as if I am in an air-conditioned room, this is the fifth pleasure.</p>
<p>Return home after work, feeling a load off my mind, prepare a basin of hot water, scrub my whole body with medicated soap, removing all the accumulated dirt, feel refreshed in body and mind, this is the sixth pleasure.</p>
<p>After bathing, sit for a while, and then dinner is set before me. I wash the hot rice with cool boiled water, it is warm but not cold, and eat it with dried radish and preserved vegetables. After chewing, the taste is better than delicacies, this is the seventh pleasure.</p>
<p>Enjoy the cool air in a high place after dinner, or listen to the singing of my little children, innocent and charming, or gather with two or three close friends to talk about everything under the sun, losing myself in delight, this is the eighth pleasure.</p>
<p>Write a diary entry before going to bed, read a few pages of my favorite books, or a few chapters of poetry, sweeping away all the gloom in my heart, this is the ninth pleasure.</p>
<p>At this time, my body is cool, my eyelids are dry, I go to bed and ask myself if I have not let anyone down, if I have not let myself down, I feel at ease in my body and mind, and I fall asleep, this is the tenth pleasure.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Air Conditioning Cloth <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Lihua</p>
<p>I gave it the name "air conditioning cloth" because major buildings, major theaters, dance halls... all have air conditioning installed in the summer, but in ordinary households? It's considered good to have an electric fan, but the electricity bill is expensive and not cost-effective. So the only thing to do is to work with your hands and use a fan instead, but that's very tiring, so it's best to save money and effort and make your body feel cooler.</p>
<p>Therefore, I came up with a method, although it is not as good as air conditioning, but its heat-reducing effect is not small. It's good to save money and effort, so it's worth using.</p>
<p>If you sprinkle some water on the ground at noon or in the afternoon of a hot day, it will dry in a short time, which indicates that part of the water is being absorbed by the sunlight (heat). If there is no part of the water, then it will obviously absorb the water from our bodies, so wouldn't we feel even hotter?</p>
<p>So our "air conditioning cloth" is based on this principle: the method is very simple, just use any piece of cloth, soak it in water, and then hang it like a window curtain in the window or in a place exposed to sunlight. You sit behind this soaked cloth curtain and can do whatever you want, because this "air conditioning cloth" can act as a curtain or blind on the one hand, and replace the water in your body on the other hand. It is not easy for sunlight to enter, and the room feels cool. Sometimes, when a cool breeze blows by, your "air conditioning cloth" also sways with the wind, and many small droplets of water blow towards you, making you feel even cooler.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Anglo-American Freeze on Chinese Funds and the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Market <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Liyu</p>
<p>Following the Anglo-American order on July 26 to freeze Chinese and Japanese funds, a significant reaction occurred in the Chinese and Japanese economies, especially in the Shanghai foreign exchange market, which underwent a complete transformation. In the past, funds could be easily transferred for speculative transactions without restrictions. Now, only legitimate transactions arising from trade are possible. Although the freedom of transaction has not been completely eliminated, the difference in degree is vast. Looking back over the three and a half years since the emergence of the black market in Shanghai, the government has tried every possible means to maintain exchange rates, but ultimately failed to prevent arbitrage and speculation, rendering their efforts incomplete. Recently, after the Sino-British-American Stabilization Fund began operations, rumors circulated that it would control trading. However, without the freezing of Chinese and Japanese assets, even if control were implemented, it would only create a black market within the black market, failing to completely close loopholes. Knowing the difficulty of controlling the Shanghai foreign exchange market, informed observers hoped for the Anglo-American freeze on Chinese and Japanese funds as one hopes for rain during a severe drought. Now that it has been implemented, its benefit to the Shanghai foreign exchange market cannot be overstated. However, it is regrettable that the UK and the US cannot thoroughly enforce it for the sake of their own commercial interests and international relations.</p>
<p>Restriction Measures</p>
<p>Although the UK and the US claim to have frozen Chinese and Japanese funds, their methods differ greatly from those applied to European countries, especially the US, which is more lenient. It can only be described as a fund management license system, not a true freeze. The restriction measures of the two countries are explained below:</p>
<p>The US measures for freezing Chinese funds are stipulated in Implementation Orders No. 58 and No. 59. The former stipulates that the trade nature of permissible US dollar transactions must be: (1) bona fide imports and exports; (2) trade not managed or entrusted by blocked countries outside China, their people, or the people of the Three Eastern Provinces, except for those residing in China; and (3) trade not related to the interests of blocked countries outside China, their people, or the people of the Three Eastern Provinces, except for those residing in China. Considering the first condition, the term "bona fide" is quite flexible. It is difficult to explain what is bona fide and what is malicious. If supplying Japanese military needs is considered malicious and trading in daily necessities is considered bona fide, there is no clear distinction between military supplies and daily necessities, making it an insufficient standard for identification. Moreover, bona fide imported goods can easily become malicious through a simple transfer, making the distinction even more confusing. Therefore, the incompleteness of this condition is very obvious. As for the second and third conditions, the nature of the trade operators and beneficiaries are specified to prevent Japan from using China as a transshipment point, which is appropriate. However, the exclusion of people from blocked countries residing in China means that the Japanese can still use China as a transshipment point, which is also very clear. Therefore, these two conditions are also insufficient to exclude Japan's indirect trade with the US. Order No. 59 stipulates the financial institutions authorized for US dollar transactions and the trade areas authorized to receive US dollars. The former designates 14 banks from the UK, the US, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, including Chase National and Citibank, but excluding Japanese and Axis banks. The latter designates five regions: the US, American republics, the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies, excluding Japan, Axis countries, and their occupied territories. The intention of the issuer of these orders is to maintain trade with China while severing commercial relations with Japan and the Axis powers. However, Shanghai itself has already developed economic ties with Japan. Even if the US does not trade directly with Japan, it cannot avoid indirect trade with Japan due to Shanghai's intermediary role. Therefore, looking at the US restriction measures, not only is the trade in luxury goods not suppressed, but also Japan's transit trade in Shanghai can proceed unhindered, except for speculative transactions. The leniency of the US freezing measures is beyond what we initially expected.</p>
<p>The British measures for freezing funds in China were received by British banks in Shanghai on the 30th. According to HSBC's announcement, all sterling deposits, bonds, and cash owned by various countries within China or by Chinese people in branches outside China shall be frozen. However, import and export trade with China and the sterling area will still be supported, and certain exchange transactions may continue. According to this regulation, not only is trade between China and the sterling area strictly limited, but also the sterling deposits of people of various countries in China cannot be withdrawn in legal tender at the exchange rate. This is much stricter than the US, which only restricts speculation without freezing deposits. Looking at the actual situation in Japan, the settlement of sterling for import and export trade is very difficult, and sterling is almost in a state of having prices but no market. Although this is due to a lack of detailed understanding, it is also due to the strict restrictions. Compared to the US, it seems somewhat more satisfactory.</p>
<p>Impact of the Freeze</p>
<p>Currently, the Shanghai foreign exchange market is dominated by the US dollar. Although the US freezing measures are not very thorough, they have already had a significant impact. Since the emergence of the foreign exchange black market in March 1938, it has not been easy to stabilize exchange rates due to the trade deficit with Japan, arbitrage, capital flight, and rampant speculation. The Sino-British Stabilization Fund failed due to insufficient funds, and the country lost a countless amount of foreign exchange. After the outbreak of the European war, capital flight subsided slightly, and exchange rates were able to stabilize. However, Shanghai was flooded with idle capital. Although there were no more days of turmoil, the Sino-British-American Stabilization Fund was able to support the difficult situation at the moment, but could not guarantee its effectiveness in the future. The government was afraid of the consequences of abandoning the black market, but also lacked a permanent solution to maintain it. Abandoning the black market would harm the interests of foreign merchants, jeopardizing diplomatic relations. Soaring special prices would affect the inland. Restricting supply would lead those who did not obtain foreign exchange to search for it through various channels, inevitably creating a black market within the black market, severely shrinking the exchange rate. The government was trapped in this dilemma, so it has been procrastinating until now, without establishing a permanent solution. However, this time, the UK and the US implemented a freeze on funds at China's request, which may allow China to determine its foreign exchange policy.</p>
<p>The biggest problems in the Shanghai foreign exchange market are the possibility of capital flight and the rampant speculation. This freeze has considerably curbed the activities of both. The British freeze on deposits and restrictions on trade have already strictly curbed speculation, which need not be discussed further. The US measure of allowing the withdrawal of US dollar deposits is also sufficient to promote the repatriation of funds held abroad. When people of various countries in China withdraw their US dollar deposits, they only collect legal tender at a proportional rate, which is to sell US dollars and exchange them for legal tender. From the perspective of the US dollar, it increases supply. From the perspective of legal tender, it strengthens demand, which should be beneficial. Moreover, some of the US dollars sold may be absorbed by the Stabilization Fund, which further strengthens the foundation of legal tender and consolidates its credit. Although exchange rates have seen a sharp decline after the news of the freeze, they have now shrunk within five yuan. However, this is actually caused by speculative merchants scrambling to cover their positions and importers using false pretenses. In the future, following the prescribed licensing system, those who settle foreign exchange must present their order forms, and the exchange rate should recover.</p>
<p>Moreover, this method of restricting foreign exchange is different from China's proactive foreign exchange control. As mentioned earlier, if the government selectively allocates foreign exchange based on people and goods, those who do not obtain foreign exchange will inevitably search for foreign currency deposits at high prices, creating another black market. However, this freezing method restricts the use of foreign currency deposits in their home country. Those who fail to obtain officially approved foreign exchange will find it useless even if they search for foreign currency deposits. Therefore, the implementation of the freezing method is actually a solution for China to the foreign exchange control problem in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Legitimate international trade can still proceed unhindered. Although Japan may be able to obtain British and American goods through this, Shanghai's supplies should not be lacking. In theory, Shanghai's special prices should not rise excessively, but hoarders are taking advantage of the freeze news, deliberately exaggerating its impact, causing a phenomenon of soaring special prices. When trade returns to normal, there is hope for a return to equilibrium.</p>
<p>Further Hope</p>
<p>Although the Anglo-American freeze on Chinese funds has already had a positive impact on China, the restrictions are too lenient to achieve the expected results. In particular, the US restriction measures have too many loopholes to fully achieve its sanctioning effect. At the time of the implementation of this freeze, we hope that the UK and the US will work closely with the Chinese government and take it one step further, so that the UK and the US can achieve their sanctioning goals, and China can enjoy the full effect of the freeze.</p>
<p>What are the further restriction measures? It is to completely freeze all Chinese funds and assets and allow the Chinese government to dispose of them; abandon trade in Shanghai and transfer commerce to Free China. During the First World War, the UK implemented the Securities Mobilization Act, which required the British government to register its funds and assets in the US. When necessary, the government would purchase them at a price, and the government would then sell the people's assets it had acquired in the US market, obtaining US dollars to purchase American military supplies, which was of great benefit to the British wartime economy. Before the outbreak of this European war, the UK promulgated the Foreign Securities Control Order on August 27, 1939, which still followed the previous law, ordering people holding foreign securities to register with the Bank of England within one month. The government could forcibly purchase them at any time if deemed necessary. Although the British government was reluctant to dispose of them at will for fear of affecting the market prices of British securities, it ultimately relied on this as collateral to obtain a large amount of loans, which also made a significant contribution to the wartime economy. At the beginning of the Chinese war, some Chinese advocated requisitioning funds and assets abroad. Later, when it was difficult to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange market, this proposal became even more rampant, believing that this drastic measure could prevent capital flight and speculation, and avoid fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. However, at that time, the requisition of foreign exchange was inconsistent with the Anglo-American principle of free trade and could not be implemented. Now that the situation has changed and the UK and the US have frozen Chinese funds and assets, why not take it one step further and prohibit the withdrawal of foreign currency deposits and the transfer of foreign securities, allowing them to be entirely controlled by the Chinese government? When the government deems it necessary, it will compensate its price with government bonds or legal tender and requisition its foreign exchange. As for the requisition price, it should be converted and compensated at the exchange rate at the time of purchase. In this way, on the one hand, it can crack down on capital flight and eliminate its undue profits; and on the other hand, it can strengthen the legal tender base and its external purchasing power, benefiting the national economy.</p>
<p>Regarding trade, this restriction method still cannot prevent Japan from obtaining military supplies in Shanghai, as mentioned above; and because the UK and the US froze Japanese funds, Shanghai is burdened with more foreign exchange for Japanese indirect trade, which is the most incomplete. Now that the international situation is turbulent and uncertain, the trade relationship between Shanghai and the UK and the US is tenuous. If we take a broader view and look to the future, we will know that the termination of trade in Shanghai is inevitable. If the UK and the US can abandon the current small profits in Shanghai and engage in trade in Free China, not only will the future be unlimited, but also the effect of sanctions can be immediately seen. Therefore, a complete freeze or strict restriction of trade is what we most hope for.</p>
<p>Although the UK and the US are concerned about the drastic changes in the international situation and the damage to Shanghai's century-old commercial foundation, they do not want to use severe sanctioning methods to provoke further conflict. However, the increasingly urgent situation in Southeast Asia has proved that appeasement is wrong. Early sanctions are the basis for a quick resolution. Thoroughly implementing the freeze will not only benefit China.</p>
<h3 id="e92">American Severe Restriction on Oil and Japan's War Power <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Feng'e</p>
<p>Oil is the lifeblood of modern war machines, but Japan's war needs are mostly supplied by the US and the Dutch East Indies. According to "Oil and Gas" magazine: in 1939, Japan's consumption of oil and its products was 5.8 million tons, but its domestic production was only 440,000 tons (including products made from imported oil), accounting for only 7%. The remaining 93% of its needs depended entirely on imports. At that time, the US supplied him with 3.54 million tons, and the Dutch East Indies supplied him with 1.6 million tons. At this time, the US had already managed oil exports, but exports to Japan were still so high. Japan had exhausted its efforts to increase production, but its gains were still so meager. It is clear that if the US implemented an embargo on oil to Japan, it could immediately control Japan's fate. Now, the US has officially ordered the prohibition of machine oil and other exports to foreign countries on August 1. Although Japan is not mentioned in the order, it is actually aimed at Japan. The Dutch East Indies also abolished the Dutch-Japanese oil agreement after the UK and the US froze Japanese funds. So how long can Japan support itself? This is an interesting question.</p>
<p>88.6% of Peacetime Consumption Depends on Imports</p>
<p>As soon as the Sino-Japanese war began, Japan stopped publishing statistics on oil imports and domestic production, so it is difficult to investigate Japan's current supply and demand situation. But his usual materials are enough for our reference.</p>
<p>The Japan Petroleum Association still publishes the Japanese oil supply and demand statistics table made in the 11th year of Showa (1936), which is still the latest of those statistics that are publicly published. They combine the refined products of imported crude oil and the refined products of domestic crude oil as domestic products. Therefore, in the total supply of Japanese oil in the 11th year of Showa, domestic products are estimated to account for about 43%. In fact, the total amount of domestic crude oil and its products is only about 10%, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Japanese domestic crude oil 104,751</p>
<p>Japanese products of crude oil 99,33</p>
<p>(A) Subtotal 104,073</p>
<p>Imported crude oil and products 1,243,463</p>
<p>Japanese products of imported crude oil 340,452</p>
<p>(B) Subtotal 1,583,915</p>
<p>Total above 1,787,988</p>
<p>A percentage of the total 2.4%</p>
<p>B percentage of the total 88.6%</p>
<p>(Note) Unit thousand gallons. Calculated according to "Domestic and Foreign Petroleum Statistics". Three hundred gallons equal one ton.</p>
<p>This means that Japan's self-sufficiency rate for oil and its products accounts for only 11.4% of the peacetime demand. Without imports, his factory machines, airplanes, cars, warships, ships, fishing boats, etc., would have to stop 88.6% in peacetime, unable to turn.</p>
<p>Wartime Japanese Oil Imports</p>
<p>Modern mechanized armies need more fuel. During the First World War, each ordinary division was about 4,000 horsepower, and now it is equivalent to 187,000 horsepower; and each mechanized division is equivalent to 2.5 million to 3.5 million horsepower. According to French newspaper reports: when the German army invaded France, each tank division consumed 1,500 tons of oil per day, and each air force division consumed 1,600 tons of gasoline per day; therefore, the entire army's daily gasoline demand reached 18,000 to 40,000 tons. Although the equipment of the Japanese army is not as good as that of the German army, there is no doubt that his wartime oil demand will increase sharply compared with peacetime.</p>
<p>The import situation of Japanese oil during the war, according to the survey of the United States, is roughly as follows: (unit US$1,000)</p>
<p>This not only points out the great increase in Japan's need for oil during the war, but also clearly indicates that the proportion of Japan's oil needs relying on the United States can also increase. Generally, people are very strange "Why didn't the United States ban the oil of combat blood at the same time when it implemented a moral embargo in mid-June 1938"? But until now, this question seems to no longer exist. Because the United States has begun to ban oil exports to Japan. And the day before the United States banned oil exports to Japan, the Dutch East Indies had abolished the oil agreement with Japan. Now we have many reasons to believe that the oil embargo to Japan by the United States and the Netherlands this time has a great determination; unless our confidence is wrong. Otherwise, no matter how much storage Japan may still have, it can be imagined that Japan has reached the difficult situation of "defeat in battle or defeat without battle." Because he wants to fight, then his poor oil conditions are really not suitable for maintaining modern warfare for long. If he still wants to avoid a head-on conflict with the United States and implement a drag, he can sit and watch the great effect of "economic sanctions" in the evolution of time.</p>
<p>How much oil does Japan currently have in storage</p>
<p>According to a joint news agency telegram on the 3rd, US Navy Secretary Knox told reporters that he guessed that Japan had one to three years of oil and gasoline storage, which was prepared for war, but he said that this was "pure speculation." Let us observe his supply again: according to the "Oil and Gas" magazine statistics, in 1939, it was 5.8 million, 3.4 million tons for civilian use, and 2.2 million tons for military use, totaling 5.6 million tons. The difference between the two numbers is 300,000 tons. Then the possible storage capacity per year will not exceed this number. No matter how actively he increases production and saves, if he stores it in this way, it will take at least twenty years to supply him with the current consumption for one year; therefore, Knox's estimate is not too low.</p>
<p>Bond Market News Knowledge Mr. Zhang Yifan's Lecture Chen Huijun's Notes</p>
<p>Shanghai University School of Commerce "Commercial News" Textbook</p>
<p>When the government's expenditures exceed its revenues and the financial balance is unbalanced, it often makes up for it by borrowing money, issuing treasury bills, or issuing public bonds.</p>
<p>Government debt without issuing bonds is called borrowing, bonds whose face value is calculated in foreign currency are called gold bonds, bonds whose value is counted in national currency are called national currency bonds, treasury bills are short-term in nature, with a term of about one year or five years, usually one year, guaranteed by the tax revenue of the current year, and the principal and interest are extracted on average every month. Therefore, it is called tax securities. Before January 28, my country had treasury bill issues, which have not been issued since the reorganization. Public bonds are long-term in nature, guaranteed by long-term national income, with interest paid on time and different repayment periods.</p>
<p>Public bonds issued due to financial imbalances are called fiscal public bonds. In Japan, they are called deficit public bonds, because the Japanese government writes the deficit in the revenue and expenditure budget in red, hence the name; and this name is also used in my country, and it is often seen in articles in newspapers and magazines. Most of the public bonds issued in my country in the past were deficit public bonds. After January 28, the Ministry of Finance reorganized the number of issues, extended the principal and interest, and the creditors proposed that the Ministry of Finance could not issue public bonds due to revenue and expenditure imbalances in the future, which was passed by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, there were no deficit public bonds in the national budget for a while. Later, the previously issued public bonds were reorganized and unified public bonds were issued, divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E according to the length of the repayment period, with face values of ten yuan, one hundred yuan, one thousand yuan, and five thousand yuan, totaling 146 million yuan, which was used to recover various old-issued public bonds and treasury bills. The interest rate is 6% per week, and the principal and interest are paid once every six months.</p>
<p>Different from deficit public bonds, there are industrial public bonds, which are issued to revitalize industry; railway public bonds, which are issued to build railways; military public bonds, which are issued to purchase military supplies; and national defense public bonds, which are issued to enrich national defense.</p>
<p>Most of the public bonds issued in China are long-term public bonds, with terms of about 30 to 50 years. The face value is mostly in unregistered form, so it can circulate freely. There is also a registered public bond in foreign countries. Registered bonds must be transferred if they need to be transferred; and there are regulations that do not allow free transfer. If registered public bonds are issued during wartime, the purpose of having money to contribute can be achieved, because who has purchased and who has not purchased are recorded; those who have not purchased can be persuaded to raise funds, so as to equalize the burden of the people.</p>
<p>The methods of raising funds include voluntary and compulsory. Voluntary is for the people to voluntarily subscribe, and they are all unregistered. The public bonds issued in our country are all voluntary. Compulsory is to compulsory apportion to the people. There are registered and unregistered forms. Most of the bonds issued during the warlord government era contained compulsion. After the Northern Expedition, voluntary subscription was the main method.</p>
<p>The price of public bonds The price of public bonds can be divided into face value market price issue price. If a public bond has a face value of 100 yuan and is issued at a 98% discount, the face value is 100 yuan, the issue price is 98 yuan, and the market price is determined by the trading in the public bond market, so the market price fluctuates.</p>
<p>Methods of paying back public bonds upon maturity:</p>
<p>Lottery —— Drawn once or twice a year, those drawn will be repaid the principal and interest, and those not drawn will pay interest.</p>
<p>Fixed term —— Repay the principal upon maturity, and pay interest before maturity.</p>
<p>When the government issued public bonds in the past, they were often issued at a 60% discount. After January 28, they were issued at a 98% discount; this discount is called the issue discount. In addition to the central government's direct issuance of government public bonds, other departments and local governments can also issue them according to their own needs. Such as the various railway public bonds of the Ministry of Communications and the various reorganization public bonds of the Zhejiang Provincial Government.</p>
<p>The greater the difference between the market discount (i.e., the market price) and the face value, the greater the benefit of buying public bonds. Because the repayment of the principal upon maturity or in the lottery is paid according to the face value, the thicker the profit obtained by buying at a lower face value.

<p>The production areas of copper originally belonged to the United States and Japan. However, the copper produced in Japan is not enough for its own use recently, so no goods come to Shanghai. Most of the copper circulating on the market now comes from the United States. There are two types of its brand name: "T" and "TC". However, in the past month or so, because the United States has banned exports and the inventory in this port has become thin, it is feared that the spot goods will be out of stock in the future. It is found that the only use of the goods in the past was to manufacture copper coins and other items. However, since the outbreak of the war, copper coins have disappeared, and the needs of military supplies have risen instead. Therefore, one of the sales channels for copper in the market now is military supplies. However, there is a shortage of spot goods in the market, so the standard has repeatedly reached peaks. It is heard that a foreign company in the city searched around yesterday, and the one being searched had about ten tons. The industry quoted a price of 850 US dollars per ton. The company once countered the price of 800 US dollars, and finally the transaction was concluded at 820 US dollars (the above idle is the "T" brand, and the transaction is calculated in US dollars). The quoted price of "TC" brand is 800 US dollars, but there are no goods on the market.</p>

<p>The market conditions of daily necessities are becoming tighter again. The sales channels from various parties and this defense area are very healthy, and hoarders are still interested. Sales are more prosperous than before, resulting in higher prices. It is estimated that each box of Beautiful brand matches is 860 yuan, Phoenix brand is 820 yuan, second-class miscellaneous brand is 700 yuan, third-class is 620 yuan, each box of Guben soap is 54 yuan and 50 cents, Bai Xiangmao soap is 47 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is 43 yuan, Arrow Knife soap is 45 yuan, White Reece Sailing Candle is 35 yuan and 50 cents, and Chicken brand candle is 33 yuan.</p>

<p>The summer sales of woolen fabrics have recently become quite outdated and declining. Regardless of whether it's for Chinese or Western-style clothing, there is currently no intention to replenish stocks. Looking back at shop sales, there's also very little movement of summer goods.

<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>As mentioned before, Persians likely knew how to make white granulated sugar in the 6th century AD, and Egyptians had already produced rock candy by the 8th century AD. When and how did this refining technology of sugarcane sugar begin and progress in our country? Although the "Sugar Frost Treatise" states, "Sugarcane is planted everywhere," specifically mentioning "Fuzhou, Siming, Panyu, and Guanghan, thus having 'sugar ice' and Ning being the best," we can determine that this "sugar ice" refers to sugar lumps made by boiling sugarcane juice, definitely not what we now call "rock candy." However, the "frost" produced at that time was already "light white," which must be considered a kind of progress in the sugar-making industry. The "Sugar Frost Treatise" also states: "In the early Xuanhe period—around 1120 AD—Wang..." However, due to the incompleteness of the document, we cannot know how "extraordinary" the sugarcane sugar produced at that time was. According to the French Encyclopedia, China hired sugar-making technicians from Egypt around 1250 AD—after the Mongols had destroyed the Jin dynasty, conquered Eastern Europe, and established the Golden Horde—to improve the sugar-making industry. This statement probably has its basis, but it cannot be proven from Chinese history. In his "Guangyang Miscellaneous Notes," Liu Jizhuang of the early Qing dynasty said: "Before the Jiajing era—before 1522 AD—there was no white sugar in the world (the word 'world' of course refers only to China). The sugar refined by the Min people was all brown sugar. During the Jiajing era, at a sugar bureau, a roof tile accidentally fell into the funnel. Upon inspection, the sugar at the top was as white as frost and tasted exceptionally sweet, different from usual. The middle was yellow sugar, and the bottom was black sugar. Surprised! They then took mud and pressed it on the sugar, succeeding every time. White sugar first appeared in the world from then on..." From this perspective, it seems that our people did not learn to make real white granulated sugar until the mid-16th century AD, which is many years later than foreign countries. Strictly speaking, I cannot definitively say that such an accidental "roof tile falling into the mud" event was impossible! However, the mid-16th century was when our country's maritime ban was greatly relaxed and trade with the Portuguese was frequent—the Portuguese leased Macau in 1557—I always suspect that the progress of our sugar industry at this time was directly learned from their methods.</p>

<h3 id="e100">How to Serve a Young Master <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Xiu</p>
<p>Hoping parents will take note</p>
<p>After exhausting countless favors and words, I was finally introduced by a friend of my father to a "mansion" to be a "private tutor." I was very happy, but that happiness was mixed with a component of fear, because I was still a "greenhorn"! But now I had to teach four children, from first grade to second grade of junior high school, which was really exhausting.</p>
<p>The next day was the day I "took office." I specially put on a pair of "Russian leather shoes" and, braving the strong sun, walked towards the "mansion."</p>
<p>Walking through the gate of the mansion, there was a courtyard. Several "young masters" were happily skating. When they saw me, they stared at me strangely and then went back to playing on their own. The youngest even rode his tricycle to me, looked at me, and then turned the car around and drove back contentedly. Passing through their "grand playground," was the parlor. I sat alone in the parlor for half an hour before the "master" lazily came out, stretching and yawning. He greeted me briefly with a listless voice, then introduced his young masters to me and sighed with a shake of his head, "Alas! Good-for-nothings, good-for-nothings, all extremely naughty! I hope the teacher will guide them more in the future. Ha!"</p>
<p>I said some polite words modestly and felt that my underwear was soaked with sweat.</p>
<p>On the third day, because class was supposed to start at nine o'clock, I rushed over at seven forty-five, intending to allocate their courses today. Who knew that after waiting in the parlor until ten o'clock, the young masters still hadn't "arrived." I was really getting anxious. To be honest, I hadn't even had breakfast yet! A servant girl next to me said, "You should come later. The young masters don't get up until eleven thirty every day! They watch plays until after one o'clock at night!"</p>
<p>At twelve o'clock, the "young masters" finally "graced us with their presence." The eldest was still wearing skates; the second and third were carrying billiard cues and paddles, slapping them all the way in; the fourth was still riding that tricycle, still chewing on candied lotus seeds. The "big troop" "charged" in with a clatter, but none of them brought books. This really made it difficult for me. What could I use to teach these naughty children? So I asked them, "Haven't you bought your books yet?"</p>
<p>"Books?" The eldest replied, "Dad said in a few days!" "What about the books you read last semester?" "Tore them up long ago!" "I still have one!" said a little one, and then he took the tricycle from the parlor, pedaled it in, and came out after a while, handing me a book. I took it and opened it. Heavens! It turned out to be a serial comic book about some knight.</p>
<p>It was time to divide the classes. After a long time, I finally decided how to divide their grades. But the eldest insisted on studying junior high school three and said loudly, "I was in junior high school two last semester!"</p>
<p>"I was in fifth grade last semester! I want to study junior high school one now!"</p>
<p>"I am…" Whirr, whirr, my mind was completely confused. As a result, I promoted them each one grade, and they all smiled happily and contentedly.</p>
<p>"Okay, now I'll test your level!" I said and wrote a very simple character to ask the youngest child who wanted to read third grade, "What character is this?" He shook his head impatiently and said, "You didn't teach me!" Then I asked the others, fourth grade, junior high school one, junior high school two, and all three gave the same answer. Moreover, they all slipped out to play after sitting for less than a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>The books were bought. The eldest bought many hardcover original Western books and many reference dictionaries. In addition to textbooks, the younger ones also bought many elementary school entrance examination guides, model Chinese dictionaries, and things like that. This really gave me a headache. Which one should I teach first within three scenes a day?</p>
<p>Every day, the same old thing. The eldest young master, the second young master, and the third young master tied those thick books together and bound them behind the fourth young master's tricycle on the ground; the fourth young master dragged them into the "study" with a whirring sound, the younger ones following the older ones. When they got to the desks, they all collapsed on the sofa and sat together in a mess. Then the eldest young master would ask many questions: "Which came first, the chicken or the egg?" "Why does the fart that comes out smell bad?" "Why is the stool that comes out yellow?" "…?" Endless questions! The second young master and the third young master would clamor for me to tell jokes, tell stories, and even play ping pong with them! What about the fourth? He would take out some rented serial comic books and want me to tell them to him, and also want me to compare whose palm is bigger and whose legs are thinner… On Sundays, the eldest would drag me to the cinema, while the younger one wanted me to accompany him to the park… It really made my head spin! But if I offended them, they would immediately throw a young master's tantrum: "I'm not going to school!" This was a great threat to me! …</p>
<p>Can things go on like this day after day?</p>
<h3 id="e101">Talking About Employment Agencies <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Guoxian</p>
<p>General "matchmaking shops" are now called "employment agencies."</p>
<p>I heard that employment agencies welcome older domestic workers. "Older" means experienced; "old mouths" are said to be much more capable when they are older. "Original households" are the slowest to sell because Shanghai families prefer more nimble workers to avoid getting entangled in unclear situations. "Original households" are those who have just come from the countryside. However, some honest families like "original households" because they take them to be more honest. Actually, they can soon become "slippery."</p>
<p>The introduction fee earned by employment agencies is calculated in proportion to the wages. According to the recent regulations of their guild: roughly, the employer and the employee each pay 20%... In Shanghai, the most sought-after are wet nurses.</p>
<p>Editor's note: According to the recent market: for maids and older servants with wages of three yuan or more, the introduction fee is 50 cents per yuan for the employer and 25 cents for the employee; in addition, there is a guarantee fee of 50 cents (2 yuan for wet nurses), paid by the employer. For wet nurses, three months' wages are paid in advance, and the introduction fee is 1 yuan 20 cents per yuan, with 60 cents for the employee. From this, it seems that employment agencies welcome wet nurses the most. But introducing a wet nurse is also a troublesome procedure. Some employers are very serious, such as requiring the wet nurse to test her body and test her blood; they don't want those who are a little worse.</p>
<p>In this season of oversupply of labor, employment agencies can be said to be full of talent. However, most housewives in general middle-class families cook for themselves and cannot afford to hire help.</p>
<p>From the perspective of employment agencies, this will naturally affect their business.</p>
<p>However, there is still no need for people to worry: many "old mouth" domestic workers, when they are introduced to an employer, will first ask about side income? See if the employer's house is big enough? Is the sleeping area good? What are the "work standards"? How many people are there? If they are not satisfied, they simply pat their butts and leave. At that time, the employment agency authorities still have to worry about the cost of a bowl of noodles.</p>

<p>Eleven. Phantom of the Opera</p>
<p>"Dad, now you can finally rest assured, right? From now on, I will never do such a silly thing again, wasting my energy and making you angry!"</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's not that easy, is it?" Begonia knew very well how annoyed the Second Master Shang would be after losing this future cash cow for nothing, so he still felt very uneasy, fearing that after a while, Manager Meng and Second Master Shang would come to make trouble.</p>
<p>Meibao, however, didn't feel there was anything to worry about and happily went to prepare food for Little Gouzi and his brothers. - These days, they were harvesting cotton in the fields, and the food they needed had to be prepared by her and sent to them.</p>
<p>Until she returned to her room with Begonia in the evening, she was still a person without any worries. The matter of learning opera seemed to have been completely forgotten. However, how many people's hearts can be as innocent as hers? Otherwise, the world would indeed seem too quiet!</p>
<p>As soon as she entered the Meng family, she felt that the situation was not right.</p>
<p>"Oh, you've come?" Second Master Shang said to her first with an iron-blue face.</p>
<p>Meibao knew that just talking would not work, so she immediately pulled the small inner manager of the Meng family aside and softly told her about her plan to send ten yuan to Second Master Shang in a few days. Sister-in-law Meng was also completely inexperienced and had a rough temperament. When she heard this, she thought it was right, of course. But how could Second Master Shang be willing to spit out the fat meat that was already in his mouth?</p>
<p>He insisted on not taking a penny and used many extremely rude and overbearing words to threaten Meibao - he had simply become another person - to continue learning opera from him. At the same time, Old Manager Meng was also saying many things to complain about Meibao. Although Meibao knew very well that these were baseless things, and it was Sister-in-law Meng who had initially suggested pulling her over, three or four people from the Meng family were blaming her in unison for ruining everything. She was a fifteen-year-old child, so it was of course difficult for her to defend herself.</p>
<p>Everyone discussed for more than an hour. Meibao worried that her father might have woken up, so she had to beg Sister-in-law Meng, hoping that they could talk again another day. (181)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Comparison of Fluorescent Lamps and Ordinary Lamps <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Han</p>
<p>It is true that fluorescent lamps save more electricity than tungsten lamps. A 40-watt tungsten bulb gets so hot that it's scalding to the touch, while the same 40-watt fluorescent lamp doesn't feel hot when touched. To use a technical term: only a small portion of the 40 watts of electrical energy in a tungsten lamp is converted into light energy; the rest is converted into unnecessary heat energy. I have used a light meter to measure the light intensity of various lamps and found that a 40-watt fluorescent lamp can be worth more than a 75-watt GE tungsten lamp. Fluorescent lamps have a large light source area, reduce shadows, have a soft light color, and have no glare that hurts the eyes. These are their significant advantages, but they also have their disadvantages. Because there are more accessories, the chances of damage and repair also increase. The price of bulbs is too expensive; a medium-sized tube costs 5 US dollars. If you calculate 18 yuan to 1 US dollar, it will be worth 90 yuan in national currency. A GE bulb is only 2 yuan each. The difference between the two cannot be measured in distance. The position of the lamp should be fixed. It is inconvenient to move it often, and it is more easily damaged in shaky places. If the filament of a tungsten bulb breaks, it is ruined, which is very obvious. But this is not the case with fluorescent bulbs; the signs of failure are not very obvious and are not easy to detect. In this way, the issue of advantages and disadvantages lies in the life of the bulb. Although the life of a bulb can be as long as four or five thousand hours or as short as several hundred hours, the average is 2,500 hours. If each lamp is used for an average of 6 hours per day, then each lamp can be used for a year and a half.</p>
