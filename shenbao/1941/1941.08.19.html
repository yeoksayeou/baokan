<p>日報注視蘇京會議</p>
<p>路透社十八日東京</p>
<p>日方消息、東京各報視羅斯福邱吉爾宣言爲英·美·蘇三國軍事聯盟之烟幕彈、莫斯科三國會議與英·蘇商的之建議、皆爲促成此趨勢之因素、朝日新聞警吿大衆注意莫斯科談話所將取之方針、並謂、英·美或巳商妥對日所施之壓力、又謂、據紐的傳來之消息、言及海參崴區現存在之危險、該港現爲英、美援助蘇聯之唯一途徑、各報幾全認八項宣言書實際爲三國之軍事聯盟、都新聞謂宣言書表明英·美現圖託詞奮鬥保衛世界和平與人類自由、以保持彼等世界之覇　、英·美熱切之願望、爲德·蘇·日三國在消耗戰爭中竭盡其軍力、英·美並誘引蘇聯以公然敵對行勸抗日、俾遂其遏止日本南進可恥之陰謀云</p>

<h3 id="c9">經濟烟幕彈之解剖 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>經濟問題之實質，率多淺顯簡單，惟每以名詞之冠飾，而反形險怪奇澀，模糊不辯。甚或拘泥陳就，炫燿耳目，主計政者於是易為輕重，得生因緣，順手牽羊，而不知生靈之塗炭。時代演進，經濟為重，切膚痛癢，豈可不謀自療自救，而任令少數官吏之盲目宰割，此經濟烟幕彈之所以必須擊破也。</p>
<p>歷史悠久而最足動人聽聞之烟幕彈，厥維供求律與自由競爭是尚。供多價賤，求多價貴，而供少則價亦貴，求少則價亦賤，經商者因此酌盈劑虛，以冀供求合度，而謀最大之利得。自由競爭，各展所長，促進效率，减輕成本，增加生產，抑低物價，優勝劣敗，天演淘汰，於已旣可將本求利，而復能增進技術之效率，對消費者，則得使享受價廉物美與時代進化之結果，此供求律與自由競爭所以相映成趣，互依為命，而成為傳統經濟學中之基本機構所由來也。</p>
<p>供求律與自由競爭之有裨以往各國經濟發展，孰能否認，但持此而謂非此制度，即末由獲得今日文明之進步，則未免失之於武斷。晚近和血限制自由競爭與供求律之運用，類能維持以往之繁榮與進步，而毫無退化之象徵。即在過去是項制度盛行時代，常多制裁之設施，而並非有絕對的完整制度之推行。在西方各國糧食與其他日用品以及藥劑等向置於「食物清潔條例」之嚴密管制。何者銷售市肆，何者加以取締，何者酌准輸出，何者專供內用，審情度勢，輒為調整。銀行鐵路以及一切公用事業，旋皆受公衆管理條例之監督，非特股東之利得加以限制，即取費之多寡與一切經營方針，無不受專吏之監視，稍違定章，懲處隨之，供求何嘗自然！競爭豈有自由！</p>
<p>迨戰時崇尚統制，舊觀悉改，生產消費與品質物價，皆由政府通盤規定，絕無自由自主之餘地。第一次世界大戰時，美國軍械工業初時由於各國競購，而得應有供求律以抬價；但從未聞有糧食得任令私人之操縱，俾其運用供求律以遂利已之圖。牛乳僅五分一瓶，食鹽僅數分一磅，公共電車雖遠至十哩二十哩僅須車資五分，是皆歷歷可數，絕未因戰時成本激增而加價，以重人民之負担者。今日英美之情形依然如此，較諸我國，何啻天壤之別。若謂第一次世界大戰時德俄物價之狂漲由於供求律之失調與統制政策之作祟，則毋寗謂由於整個經濟機構之崩潰為準確也，換言之，推行統制而不能收效時，即反證狂瀾之不可收拾，病之已入膏肓矣。</p>
<p>總之，各國之自由競爭與自然供求制度施行後，雖獲有卓著之成績，但此並非謂實施統制後即不能獲致同等之成績，反之，衝之過去各時代廢除自由競爭與自然供求之經過，足徵統制政策之有利而無弊。世界經濟制度之何去何從，尚未可逆料，但統制政策之將成為制度之樞紐，猶之木已成舟。我國歷代向來推行統制政策，對於食米一項尤所重視，故有穀貴傷民，穀賤傷農之說，而各省往往藉此為調整民食之張本。雖然過去實施統制而未見糧食問題之解決，但近三十年來之推行自由競爭，亦未見問題解決之有何把握也。窮則變，變則通，斟酌損益，因時制宜，是在當局者之善於運用耳。</p>

<p>舟發北江</p>
<p>軍隊方面為我們設法了一輛貨車，開到韶光旅館，這輛汽車需要兩個人來駕駛，一個司機，一個機匠。機匠的工作是撥動引擎，汽車下崗時從車上跳下來在後輪後方墊塞木塊，路中如有障礙，和人交涉。機匠有肺結核症，他的咳嗆與司機黏膜炎咳嗽相應和。車輛後部堆儲行李，還有三個同行的軍官，四個衛兵，都是細長靜默，穿了褪色的棉制服。</p>
<p>我們的衛兵携有步槍，手榴彈，盒子砲等。他們雖只有十九歲光景，但看去總要老上十一二歲。他們都極和氣謙善，曾二次向我借熱水瓶要開水。</p>
<p>泥路在多霧的雨天呈淡黃色。我們經過鄉村中見有四方石堡，農民曾在此地避過匪亂，但在炸彈轟炸之下，此地已不是躱避所在。我們經過有灰色泥漿的稻田赤脚農夫在一頭禿毛水牛後面種田。此地林木葱　，山峰尖峭，有開了像金銀花般的叢樹，車行二小時，已駛到公路不甚平穩的一部份。司機伏在輪盤上，不勝咳嗆之苦，我們用足精神，一手　住車窗，一手抵住車頂。車輛在泥地中駛過，路上多泥穴，汽車跳過，震動極烈。司機和機匠咳嗽，吐痰，喃喃談話。</p>
<p>我們駛抵一個山頭，在村邊停下。我們在三小時中跑了三十五哩路，以後去就無路可尋了。一行人隨了背行李的苦力跑到泥岸邊。我們很舒適地跨上汽油船甲板，坐在船鈎和繩索上面。這船每隔二小時要抽水一會，以免沉沒。船身已極腐朽，可用拳頭敲破。船艙中汚穢惡臭，如預期一般。在北江中這算是僅有的一艘汽油船了。</p>
<p>每一人，每一件物都已上船，我們駛入江中，後面拖有民船一艘，有汽油船兩倍大小。這民般用　　分為數部，船中是我們的衛警，三個軍官，還有船主的家屬——二個男人，二個孩子，二個女人，一個新生的嬰兒，哭得很利害。母親把嬰孩縛在背上燒飯，這樣哭來比較好一點。</p>
<p>有不少掛了棕色破帆的民船向下游駛去，逆流上駛的重載的船用篙撑或拉縴駛行。中國行船的方法有的是灣了腰用肩胛撑住竹篙，有的把重載的船隻用繩索縴行。一行男人，女人，孩子用縴繩拖了沉重的貨船緩緩向前行進。他們用力向前拉時唱着喊着，聲浪飄過水面，像起伏的哀泣。</p>
<p>到目的地</p>
<p>到這無路可擇的前綫，有三條水道可通，北江亦是其中之一。汽油船上的把舵者是一個老人，有稀疏的白髮幾隻黃牙齒，一面黑色絨繩小帽，還有一枝旱烟管。他交叉了兩腿坐在靠舵輪的高椅上把一碗白飯用筷子抓進嘴中。於是呷一匙湯，吐一口氣覺得甚為滿意的樣子，再向窗吐一口痰。他的小孫子把旱烟管遞給他。他的孫兒是一個很有趣的傢伙，也戴了同樣的一頂絨繩帽，同樣一副默想的面孔。孫兒睡在前面奇臭難聞的廁所擱上，大部份的時間用抽水機把船中的水抽掉。</p>
<p>在此時拖民船的繩子，粗細足可打一包裹，忽然折斷。現在是下午四點半，可以吃晚飯了，所以民船用竹篙撑攏，我們跨到那船上，坐在船板上，把筷子在沸水中蕩了一會，開始這天第一次的吃飯。六時，天色已黑，衛警都已入睡，軍官穿了長　衫，蜷縮在民船船板上。我們回到空氣新鮮的甲板上。</p>
<p>我們在無光的晚上行進，天色將黎明時，汽船將要擱淺。把舵者的兒子站在船頭，用船鈎測量水深。他用歌調的聲音唱給把舵的聽：「二呎，二呎半，二呎」，緩緩的報告，以至又遇第二個沙洲。我們擱淺了五次，最後　得人也錯亂了。民船倒超過我們，行在前面。把舵者承認無法，把我們駛近岸邊，那裏足有四十艘民船停靠着。我們走近時，立刻聽到他們的聲音，聞到一股氣息，還有不少蚊虫種。赫明威看了這種浮家泛宅的船戶，很覺有趣。</p>

<p>市塲人心大為振奮</p>
<p>依據上述文吿、祗知平準會對經營合法貿易之進口商、已規定美金滙率爲五元三四三七五、惟對英鎊匯率所訂水準、並未見於明文、但據大中社記者探悉、平準會同時對英匯亦有規定、爲三便士一五六二五、此係麥加利銀行高級職員相吿、當不能視爲訛傳也據稱、平準會此舉之目的、在穩定匯市、鞏固法幣地位、按照此官定水準、以維持本市必需品之進口、但對投機交易、並不佻給、並限制不能按照此一新匯率、與本市或日本本部之日商經營貿易、在過去數星期中、市塲所需之頭寸、幾以經營合法之進口商爲主、但由於投機家爭購、日商銀行暗中補空、致英美匯率暴縮、其間不無受有損失、今日平準會宣佈官定美匯水準後、彼等驟能以更有利之匯率結得外匯、於是整個市塲、人心頗爲振奮、（按依照新匯率計算、美金一元、折合法幣十八元八角二分）、</p>
<p>供給外滙限必需品</p>
<p>平準基金委員會昨日之通告中、並未提及請結外匯之貨品、是吾須以非奢侈者爲限、但依照財政部二十八年七月一日公佈之非常時期禁止進口貨品辦法、規定海關進口物品十八組二百三十叫稅則號列、如洋酒·罐頭果食·蔬菜·以及奢侈性之毛貨·棉貨·木村·紙張·竹木·籘器·土石製品·與可覓代用品之液體燃料等、一律禁止進口及轉口、或用郵包由外洋寄遞進口、上海關因環境特殊、迄未遵辦、惟此後上項應禁之品、如由上海關輸入、則一律停止供給外匯、換言之、進口物品得申請外匯、唯以必需品爲限、對投機者假借進口商名義、則嚴予拒絕、</p>

<p>姓陳的靑年巳經一十歲了，下學期還只是高中一年級，其間爲戰爭避難，輟學了相當時期。他的父親，原在南京國家銀行裏辦事，不幸戰後去世，領着五千元的撫卹金，他的母親。外祇父母。和兩弟兩妹，便靠這筆卹金苦度，幾年來將化費完了，現在由他父親生前的好友本埠某銀行的襄理袖助一些，這境况是够悽慘的。</p>
<p>一位姓水的小姐，她的父親是某銀行浙江分行裏的職員，不幸也於三年前去世了。遺下子女等六七人，現在靠銀行裹每月百元（扣去所得稅四元）的撫卹金維持生活。這位小姐現在幼稚師範將是高二，上半年校方曾免去學費二十元，一弟在職業中學，一弟在小學，生活的艱難可想而知。</p>
<p>可憐的孩子</p>
<p>喬姓十三歲的孩子，上學年在肇光中學初一，暑期裏已考取了中華職業學校初中二土木科。巾請表上雖寫着母子三人，事實上他的哥哥遠在重慶，業電料工匠，只够維持個人的生活。他和母親寄居親戚家裏的扶梯間，暗無天日。當他訴述生世時，不禁痛哭起來。他的成續並不滿意，原因是扶梯間裏不能自修，而且學校課畢回家，還要爲人帮工，很少自修的機會。這個可憐的孩子，要不資助他，他將沒有機會獲得較好的生活知識和技術咧</p>
<p>一個十七的大孩子，在他的申請表上，並不能看出他有什麼特殊的地方，只知他和家長或保護人的關係是甥舅。那知接談以後，總知他原來是一個孤兒，父母早就故世，還有四個兄弟，竟也先後夭亡，這眞是極人間的慘事！他現在倚靠舅父過活，舅父在一家私人醫院裏當掛號，這種職業的薪給，要維持他外甥的學費，當然是困難的。這孩子現在是職業中學高二的機械科。研究專門技術，對於他求生存方面講是最最適宜的。（Ｔ）</p>

<p>一位高中部的女學生，她有着超等的成績，但她並不因成績優良而自懈，仍在刻苦的研討着，用功着。當我前往訪問的時候，她正在客堂中從事於暑期的學業，更證實了她平常優良的成績，不是偶然的。她本來是一位寄宿生，家裏的人都住在故鄕，因値暑期，暫時寄居在那相當富裕的親威家裏，陪伴着那親戚家中的二個孩子，補習暑期學業。</p>
<p>她穿着樸實的衣服。現着為何的態度，帶着文雅的語氣，和我作了十分鐘的談話，我在談話中得知了她家庭的概況：她原來是「獨養囡，」沒有兄弟姊妹，世居果縣的鄉間，有着十餘畝的田地，和幾間鄉間的房屋，她父親又能勤儉治家，所以在戰前可以算得是小康之家，自從戰事發生，家鄉淪陷，地方不靖，家庭經濟，受了重大的打擊：而她更受不了虛驚恐慌，和失學的打擊，便隻身避難來滬求學，寄宿在校中，逢到假日，不時到那家比較接近的親戚家裏居住。不過她在滬求學的費用，是一個重大的支出，但不願就此失學，同時更不願再增加老年父母的愁苦：她不便常川居住在親戚的家裏，在這樣的情況下，才決定向本報申請一部份的學費，最後我問她那家親戚可否稱助時，她沒有回答，而上露着為難的神情。</p>
<p>我得了以上的結果，據實的寫了一個報告，至於對於那位家境並不怎樣淸寒，而却十分好學的女靑年，是吾給予獎助，那是我的責任以外的事了。（Ｃ）</p>

<h3 id="c80">豐衣足食以外 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>在這個苦難的時代中，乏衣缺食是司空見慣的苦事。衣食是人生之本，自然重要。然而在豐衣足食的幸運兒中，我們却可以發現一些值得慨嘆的現象。</p>
<p>“爹是個典型的嚴父，整天轉着經濟的念頭，每天好像要把報紙吞下去似的。孩子們十年也見不到他的一點笑臉。他似乎不知道精美的衣食，不能滿足孩子們內心的需要。我情願不坐汽車，不住洋樓，而爹能夠和我們一起談談笑笑。我希望他是個黃包車夫，而不是個銀行家。我和他中間似乎有一層隔膜。我不能親近他，他不能了解我。”一這是一位十五六歲的女孩子信中的話，是不幸的幸運兒的內心痛苦的傾訴。</p>
<p>人類固然要靠物質與金錢來維持生活，但是人生決不是單靠物質與金錢所能解決得了的。除了物質的享受以外，我們更需要精神上的愛與了解。</p>
<p>人生的幸福與否，要看生活的方式是否合理。一個過分注重物質享受的人，也往往不懂得怎樣取得合理的生活。他們不知道豐衣足食以外，還有其他的需要。</p>
<p>請你想想看，你的孩子除了衣食以外，還需要甚麼嗎？</p>

<p>— 華志</p>
<p>一世之雄的黑衣首相墨索里尼，今年可說“禍不單行”。他的軍隊既在東非和希臘連吃敗仗，他在國內的地位，也全靠德國的特務人員替他撐持。他的女兒即外交部長齊亞諾的夫人，一度落水，險遭沒頂，不多幾天前，他的次公子勃魯諾，又以駕駛飛機失事殞命聞了。</p>
<p>墨索里尼諸公子中，較長的兩位，即索魯諾和維多里奧，都已加入空軍，任尉級軍官。勃魯諾現年約二十四歲，在十七歲時，已考取飛行駕駛員。阿比西尼亞戰事爆發，年纔十八的，他一担任空軍戰鬥員。後來他又加入義國志願軍團，前往西班牙，幫助國民軍作戰。義軍進攻希臘時，勃魯諾和維多里奧兄弟倆，駕駛轟炸機，前往雅典等地轟炸。</p>
<p>勃魯諾在私人方面，任拉丁美洲航空公司的經理。這公司所辦的航线很長，從羅馬通到巴西京城里約熱內盧，並可從該處通往阿根廷和智利京城。</p>
<p>勃魯諾的騰空紀錄，達二千小時左右，對於駕駛民用軍用航空飛機，都有豐富的經驗，他自稱最歡喜空戰，他的理由是：“因為空戰使人奮發，增加生活緊張程度，也使人們對於生活有更切實的感覺。一個初出茅廬的民用機駕駛員，絕不能想像到他在空戰中所需學習的許多技術。只有在和敵機相遭遇，通過敵機的彈雨，或目擊高射砲彈在他四周爆炸之後，他方才能體味到一個真正空中戰士所必需的條件。戰爭使他成為一個飛行家和好漢。所以這是一個顯身揚名的出路。”</p>
<p>墨索里尼的兒子都茁壯活發，儉樸耐勞，勃魯諾尤其使人獲有印象。他在軍隊中，並沒有擺着首相兒子的架子，同隊的人都直呼他的名子，並和他打趣。但他並非不好威風，他常把上　短不可即的鬍子捻起來，以示他的不可侵犯，不過這種辦法，只有增加別人對他的笑料而已。</p>
<p>至於勃魯諾是否嗜戰若命，願成為一個殺人不眨眼的魔王呢？並非如此。他向人表示願意戰爭早些結束，以便努力開拓他的民用航空公司呢。</p>
<p>這次他在比薩附近駕駛新式長射程轟炸機試飛，向地面作安全降落時，忽然失事　地，也可說是無妄之災。</p>
<p>希特勒聽得他的盟兄墨索里尼有喪子之痛，連忙打了一個電報去安慰他，事實上此次歐戰以德國為戎首，小墨索里尼也可說是蒙了不白之死。</p>

<h3 id="c82">人老易忘？ <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>我們大概都承認老年人無論如何總要比年青小伙子健忘些。據心理學專家告訴給我們說，一個人到了將近四十歲時，他的記憶力就慢慢地開始退化了。從這個時候起，學習新的東西似乎也困難得多了。但是例外的背詩與記數目却都不可受什麼影響。由此可知所謂記憶力的退化，是不能一概而論的。</p>
<p>最近有一位心理學專家，曾用了十一種不同的方法，來測驗記憶力的強弱，其中包括有背句子，記三位數目字，段落的複誦，默字，默畫等各項測驗。段落的複誦當然要比記數目默字等困難些。至於默畫呢，非但需要好的記憶力，并且亦得有繪畫的能力。</p>
<p>記憶往往祇能夠是單方面的。舉例來說吧，許多人都祇能記得各個不同的面孔，都記不得姓甚名誰。各人的記憶力也不盡是相同的，大凡聰明的人記憶力退化得稍為要比愚蠢的人慢些。</p>
<p>上面所提到的那們專家，他說老年人總不能夠與新的事物結合得很好，結果一是健忘</p>
<p>為了補救易忘的缺點，心理學家曾為我們想出了許多方法來。他們叫我們隨時隨地把要緊的事情記在備忘冊裏，以備閑暇時可以任意翻閱而免忘却。其次一是不要因為自己已年老了，一專門去依靠青年人，我們知道愈依靠別人健忘性一愈大。假使我們要記的話，那麼就該自己記牢；凡是敏感的，能夠適應新環境的老年人他們的記憶力一定是相當強的</p>
<p>最後，讀書也可以幫助我們記憶。有許多人年紀未老就在說：“不中用啦，現在早不是讀書的時候啦！”其實，他們都是錯了。讀書會練習我們的思維力，因而增強了記憶力。</p>

<p>一個人的鼻子如果不慎撞壞了，他可以去請教整容醫生。醫生能夠設法從他的肋骨中取出一小片軟骨來，安補到他鼻子上。不過這需要兩次手術。</p>
<p>但病人如果有錢的話，他就可以買一片別人的軟骨。現在紐約某公司登記出賣軟骨的男女已有百餘人。所需費用大約一百至五百美金。</p>
<p>人體中可取出軟骨的地方有五處：鼻子，雙耳，兩側肋骨。普通取出的肋骨約半英寸寬，四分之一英寸長。最高紀錄為半英寸寬，二英寸長。</p>
<p>從他人身上移植軟骨時，整容醫生也需要兩位。一位替“賣主”動手術，一位替“買主”動手術。</p>

<p>— 蕙風</p>
<p>“葡萄美酒”原名“夜光杯”，戰後在內地各處演出非常走紅。在上海有過一個時期被禁，不得上演，不久前天風劇社曾排演過數星期，改名“恩與仇”，由慕容婉兒主演，得到相當好評。現在中旅又把它改名為“葡萄美酒”，而且在原來的四幕前另加上第一幕，共成為五幕，中間台詞情事亦小有變動，不過劇情大概和主旨意識還是一樣的。</p>
<p>故事發生在十數年前軍閥橫行的時代，一個舞女陳鳳雲為了私仇，為了公憤，受了革命黨人的囑託，到漢口去謀刺萬惡軍閥黃伯仁，黃本來是追求她的舞客，當然極易接近，但因為防守嚴密，苦於無法下手，不得不勾搭上黃的親信副官余忠，曉以大義，勸他共同刺死伯仁。余忠是一個正道青年，立刻覺悟了黃的可惡和他自己的責任，而立下了除害的決心，不意事情被余母知道了，她本來是黃的乳母，由於一種愚昧的感情，並為保全余忠的性命計，竟把這事告訴了黃，黃立刻把二人逮捕，先處死了余忠，再逼問鳳雲口供。鳳雲知道她的克夫也已被害，在深切的仇恨中，決計以犧牲求得代價，便設法把毒藥放入葡萄美酒，與黃同歸於盡。</p>
<p>此劇主旨不在暴露軍閥的罪惡，而在喚醒一般為惡魔作走狗的人們。並斥責他們的愚昧，像余忠未始不是一個正道有為的青年，因為認識不清竟做了一個軍閥的　兇而忘記了自己對國家民族的責任，後來他覺悟了，雖然事未成而身死，但是他的死是光榮的，比之先前的效愚忠於黃，勝過多了。還有余母的愚昧是造成悲劇的最大因素，她不明利害，茫然無知，祇顧念着主子給他們的一點恩惠，為了想保全兒子的性命職位，致敗壞大事，並斷送了她兒子的性命，像這種意識朦昧的人是得不到同情而應歸淘汰之列的。</p>

<p>（三）黃桂秋拜師起風波（上）</p>
<p>北方梨園除掉四大名旦之外，還有四大霉旦，所謂四大霉旦者，是指徐碧雲，朱琴心，黃桂秋，王幼卿四人而言。因為這四位旦角都是有高超的藝術，而始終倒霉到底，所以被稱為四大霉旦。講到四大霉旦，徐朱王三人久已默無聲息，唯有黃桂秋仍然和環境奮鬥着，繼續度他的舞台生活。現在桂秋在北方，雖然不常出演，但是他竭力的在藝術上討進取，最近乃有拜王瑤卿為師以求深造的動機。因為他知道他如果能得到瑤卿的指點，一定可以在藝術方面，得到無限的幫助。所以在一個月以前他一挽託他的知友章小山，（故都名票學王瑤卿最早之一人，與瑤卿相交甚厚，也是王門弟子。）去徴求瑤卿的同意，不料這位專收徒弟的通天教主，對於章小山所介紹的黃桂秋，却表示絕對不收，而且還發了一場牢騷。瑤卿為什么要發牢騷呢？這件事說來話長。</p>
<p>原來在二十年前，黃桂秋一度要拜王瑤卿為師，當時瑤卿一口答應，而且擇定日子，預備舉行拜師典禮，不料此時有人對黃桂秋建議，與其拜王瑤卿不如拜陳德霖，因為瑤卿是德霖的徒弟，拜了德霖可以和瑤卿稱為師兄弟，似乎無形中地位增高。黃桂秋一聽有理，大為感動，於是就在王瑤卿已準備收黃桂秋為徒弟的這一個極短的過程中，這位黃老板竟自食前言，而拜列陳石頭德霖的門墻。當時的王瑤卿，自然對於黃桂秋大為不滿，但是因為對方是自己的老師，也祇好忍氣吞聲，但是這口氣，始終在肚子裏。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Roosevelt and Hull Hold Extensive Talks: Meticulous Review of the International Situation; Washington Focuses on the Far East; US and UK Determined to Jointly Prevent Further Japanese Advancement <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 17th – Since Roosevelt's return to Washington, all eyes here have been fixed on the Far East. The President and Secretary of State Hull conferred for two hours. Well-informed sources believe that the discussions largely centered on how to halt Japan's expansionist ambitions, the UK, US, and Soviet Union, and the upcoming Moscow conference. Although London has reported that the Soviet Union is willing to actively participate in the "anti-Japanese movement," the US delegation to Moscow will still explore to what extent Stalin is willing to cooperate with the UK and US in jointly resisting Japan's southward expansion. It is widely believed in Washington diplomatic circles that Japan will not immediately invade Thailand or Siberia, extending the European war to the Pacific. However, various circles here believe that the development of events is prompting Japan to make a decision on peace sooner rather than later, so the final juncture is not far off. Since 31 British transport ships arrived last week carrying troops to reinforce Singapore, completing the joint defense of the South Pacific, and since Roosevelt and Churchill announced the eight-point declaration of war aims and plans for rebuilding peace, Japan's actions have undoubtedly become more cautious. The official details of Roosevelt and Churchill's talks at sea have not been released, but according to well-informed sources, one of their most important decisions is that they believe the Soviet Union will survive this winter's fighting. Therefore, the democratic nations should now concentrate their efforts on the Far East, using peaceful or military means to detach Japan from the Axis. It is also said that Churchill has allowed Roosevelt to use the Singapore base at any time should war with Japan break out.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 18th – President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull held a two-and-a-half-hour talk on Far Eastern and European issues. Well-informed sources indicated that the meeting focused more on Far Eastern events. It was also said that the Japanese situation was reviewed with a very serious attitude, and even the plight of Americans trapped in Japan was discussed. Some sources even said that economic pressure on Japan was discussed at the time. Hull later told reporters that the talks were merely an exchange of general information. "We simply informed each other of the latest international situation. We also discussed various situations that interested us." Hull declined to offer any specific criticism. However, the fact that President Roosevelt was met at the train station by Hull upon his return to Washington and that such a long meeting took place immediately afterward could not but impress people, leading them to believe that a major development in the Far East, if not imminent, has already occurred, necessitating an immediate review by the two men. President Roosevelt's remarks to reporters last Saturday that he had reached an understanding with British Prime Minister Churchill on various diplomatic policies further strengthened the general belief that the President's long talk with Hull was to convey the British decision to participate in the Far Eastern process and the British readiness to support the United States in resisting further Japanese advances. At the same time, Lord Beaverbrook, the British Minister of Supply who attended the maritime conference, had lunch yesterday with Harry Hopkins, the American coordinator of aid to Britain, at the White House. They were clearly discussing the supply of military goods for the UK, US, and Soviet Union. It is reported that President Roosevelt arrived in Washington at 10:30 AM, and Hull personally greeted him at the station before heading to the White House for talks. The President plans to meet with congressional leaders, Vice President Wallace, Senate Majority Leader Barkley, Speaker of the House Rayburn, and House Majority Leader McCormack on Monday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th – It is reported that President Roosevelt discussed the international situation with Secretary of State Hull at the White House yesterday, focusing on the Far Eastern crisis and Vichy's relationship with Germany. Congressional leaders will meet with the President today to discuss another Lend-Lease appropriation of over $1 billion. It is widely believed that the President and Secretary of State also discussed developments in the Far East, such as Japan's various restrictions on the voyage of the President Coolidge. When the President's yacht returned to Rockland on Saturday, a single anti-aircraft gun was seen mounted on the deck. During a press conference held on board, the President was asked if he would broadcast a fireside chat about the maritime conference. The President replied, "That depends on you. If you provide the nation with accurate information, I will not need to broadcast."</p>
<h3 id="e2">Vichy Orders Ban on Vietnam Rubber Trade <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>International News Service, Vichy, 18th – The Vichy government yesterday ordered the cancellation of all contracts for Vietnamese rubber. The aim of this move is to cut off the flow of rubber to the UK and US, which the government does not deny. An official statement announced the order, saying it was done in the interests of the people. It is said that both futures and spot transactions are prohibited. No remedies were mentioned for companies holding contracts. Although the new regulations have no exceptions, it is widely believed that Germany and Japan will easily obtain rubber in Vietnam and will benefit from the end of competition from democratic countries. Observers say that Vichy's submission to Axis pressure has reached its peak with this order, following the freezing of Axis funds by the UK and US. This is France's only move to deal with the UK and US economically.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japan to Decide on War or Peace Within Ten Days: Anglo-American Pressure Sufficient to Make Japan Consider; Araki Says Should Not Rely on Foreign Countries <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Washington, 17th – Diplomatic circles here say that Japan will decide on the issue of war or peace within ten days. If Japan maintains the status quo, this is peace. Conversely, if it seeks to advance south into Thailand or north into Siberia, war will inevitably break out and spread throughout the Pacific. However, it is believed that Japan does not want to expand the war to the Pacific. The recent meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill clearly devoted considerable time to discussing the Far East. However, President Roosevelt declared that he did not believe the US was now close to war, which is significant. It is implied that the pressure from the UK and US is sufficient to make Japan carefully consider its actions. Other factors include: first, the UK, US, and Soviet Union will hold a conference in Moscow; second, the US is stepping up aid to the UK and Soviet Union in all aspects, especially aircraft; third, Thailand is firmly resisting Japanese pressure; fourth, China's war against Japan is becoming increasingly active; fifth, French forces have arrived in Malaya and Burma for reinforcement; and sixth, the UK, US, and Netherlands are implementing economic sanctions against Japan. All these factors are important for maintaining peace in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 17th – Former Army Minister Araki recently told a reporter from the Hochi Shimbun that when Imperial Russia collapsed in 1918, Japan occupied Siberia. At this time, this historical fact will be re-enacted before our eyes. The Siberian incident can truly be called the beginning of our country's continental policy. Unfortunately, at this time, people from all walks of life in the country are obstructing the government from making bold decisions to promote its established national policy. Although our goals are very correct, we failed to make decisive decisions. Also, because we are deeply afraid of provoking the United States, we do not know how to adopt a clear policy. This is completely different in Germany, which is admirable. But Japan should not rely on foreign countries but should rely only on its own strength. In short, if we want to implement national policy and achieve success, then we must take clear and unchanging measures. Therefore, our country should first clarify the national policy to the whole country and then work hard to move forward.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Monitor Moscow Conference</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 18th</p>
<p>Japanese sources state that Tokyo newspapers view the Roosevelt-Churchill declaration as a smokescreen for a military alliance between the UK, US, and Soviet Union. The proposed Moscow three-nation conference and the UK-Soviet consultations are all factors contributing to this trend. The Asahi Shimbun warned the public to pay attention to the direction the Moscow talks will take, saying that the UK and US may have already agreed on the pressure to be applied to Japan. It also said that according to news from New York, there is talk of the danger that now exists in the Vladivostok area. That port is currently the only route for British and American aid to the Soviet Union. Almost all the newspapers consider the eight-point declaration as a de facto military alliance of the three countries. The Miyako Shimbun said that the declaration shows that the UK and US are now trying to use the pretext of struggling to defend world peace and human freedom to maintain their world hegemony. The keen desire of the UK and US is for Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan to exhaust their military strength in a war of attrition. The UK and US also entice the Soviet Union to openly oppose Japan in order to achieve their shameful conspiracy to curb Japan's southward advance.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 18th – The Nichi Nichi Shimbun yesterday published an article warning the Soviet Union, saying that the Soviet Union's rejection of the UK and US sending permanent observers to Moscow is the most significant thing from the Kremlin. If the Soviet Union accepts this proposal, Japan will regard it as a measure to encircle Japan. The Hochi Shimbun yesterday commented on the Soviet Union's exchange of raw materials and other goods with the UK and US, saying that if the Soviet Union's cooperation with the UK and US makes Soviet-Japanese relations worse, this is Moscow's own fault. The newspaper pointed out that this agreement will inevitably affect Japanese-Soviet relations.</p>
<h3 id="e4">US Ambassador Grew Visited Japanese Foreign Minister Yesterday Afternoon: Discussed Important Pending Issues, Including Shipping and Evacuation of Nationals <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 18th – US Ambassador to Japan Grew visited Foreign Minister Toyoda this afternoon. The purpose of the visit was not announced, but the most important pending issues between the US and Japan are the shipping issue, the unfreezing of diplomatic funds, and the permission for Americans wishing to leave Japan and general American nationals to withdraw. Some observers here believe that Japan is delaying resolving the shipping and unfreezing issues in order to further study the attitude of the UK and US, to see whether the UK and US will only threaten with measures short of war or whether there will be the most unfortunate consequences. It is noteworthy that Japanese newspapers carry news from London and Washington saying that the UK and US have even hinted that if Japan takes no further action, the UK and US are willing to explore whether it is possible to restore trade. However, the Asahi Shimbun suspects that this news is merely clever propaganda from the UK and US. The exact reason why Japan has not accepted the American proposal to unfreeze the funds of diplomatic personnel has not been known, but observers speculate that Japan wants to obtain a broader unfreezing agreement before Japan can implement any unfreezing. Currently, the obstacle to shipping negotiations is Washington's failure to ensure favorable terms, and the US's current concern seems to be to obtain a way to evacuate American nationals. A survey of one hundred Americans by the United Press found that they have all reached the Japanese side's freezing limit because the Japanese side restricts American nationals' monthly expenses to no more than 500 yen, which is only one-third of the average monthly expenditure of ordinary Americans in Tokyo. Although it has only been half a month since the freezing restrictions were implemented, those surveyed all said that their expenses for this month have already exceeded 500 yen. For example, the United Press correspondent has not yet received any remittance and relies only on the cash he had before the implementation of the freezing order to maintain himself. The penalty for monthly expenses exceeding 500 yen is imprisonment for six months, and may be commuted or combined with a fine of 5,000 yen. At the same time, the American Embassy here has implemented a twenty-hour shift system due to the tension in Japanese-American relations and the heavy workload. The number of embassy telegrams last month was unprecedented. The embassy usually has no lights on at night, but recently it has been brightly lit every night.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 18th – The Japanese government is now intensifying its control over foreigners, especially British and American nationals. The Foreign Ministry has recently notified all embassies, legations, and consulates that all foreigners in Japan who wish to leave the country must obtain permission. Traditionally, only the police authorities need to be notified, but since the new regulations came into effect on August 15, such actions must be approved by the prefectural governor. This request to leave the country must be submitted at least three days before departure, but it is reported that the Japanese government does not intend to create too many difficulties.</p>

<p>United Press, Washington, 18th – Michigan Democratic Congressman Dingell said yesterday that he had written to President Roosevelt, requesting that the United States immediately intern 10,000 Japanese nationals in Hawaii in concentration camps. He said, "In this way, the American nationals held hostage by Japan will be on a one-to-one basis." Dingell said that he was not overly sympathetic to the personal situation of the American nationals lingering on, as he had previously ordered them to return home. He said Japan should be given the impression that the United States is determined to protect its interests. He said that if Japan takes retaliatory measures, the United States still has 150,000 Japanese nationals in Hawaii and elsewhere who can serve as "backup personnel for retaliation."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 18th – Counselor Ida of the Japanese Embassy here said yesterday that there is currently no consideration of withdrawing Japanese nationals in the United States.

<h3 id="e9">An Analysis of the Economic Smokescreen <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The essence of economic problems is mostly simple and straightforward, but they are often adorned with titles, which make them seem strange and abstruse, blurring the distinction. Some even cling to stale ideas, flaunting appearances, making it easy for those who manage finances and politics to take things lightly or heavily, and to gain opportunities to act, thus taking advantage of situations without considering the suffering of the people. As the times evolve, economics is of utmost importance. Since the pain is felt deeply, how can we not seek self-healing and self-rescue, but allow a small number of officials to blindly control it? This is why the economic smokescreen must be shattered.</p>
<p>The most historically enduring and emotionally compelling smokescreen is the law of supply and demand and free competition. Abundant supply leads to low prices, high demand leads to high prices, and scarce supply also leads to high prices, while low demand leads to low prices. Merchants therefore weigh surpluses and deficits to balance supply and demand and seek maximum profits. Free competition allows each to display their strengths, promote efficiency, reduce costs, increase production, and lower prices. The superior survive and the inferior are eliminated, evolving naturally. This allows merchants to both secure profits and increase the efficiency of technology. For consumers, it allows them to enjoy affordable goods and the results of the evolution of the times. This is why the law of supply and demand and free competition complement each other, rely on each other for survival, and become the fundamental institutions in traditional economics.</p>
<p>Who can deny the benefits of the law of supply and demand and free competition to the economic development of various countries in the past? But to assert that without this system, today's civilizational progress could not have been achieved is an overstatement. In recent times, restricting free competition and the application of the law of supply and demand has generally maintained past prosperity and progress without any signs of decline. Even in the past, when this system prevailed, there were often many restrictive measures, and the complete system was not absolutely enforced. In Western countries, food, other daily necessities, and medicines have always been subject to strict control under the "Food Hygiene Regulations." What can be sold in stores, what is subject to ban, what is permitted for export, and what is for domestic use only are adjusted according to circumstances. Banks, railways, and all public utilities are subject to the supervision of public management regulations. Not only are the profits of shareholders restricted, but the amount of fees charged and all operating policies are subject to the supervision of special officials. Any violation of the regulations is punished accordingly. Where is the natural supply and demand! Where is the free competition!</p>
<p>During wartime, when control is emphasized, the old order is completely changed. Production, consumption, quality, and prices are all stipulated by the government as a whole, with no room for freedom or autonomy. During the First World War, the American arms industry initially benefited from the law of supply and demand to raise prices due to the competitive purchases of various countries; but it was never heard of that food was allowed to be manipulated by private individuals, allowing them to use the law of supply and demand to achieve their own interests. Milk was only five cents a bottle, salt was only a few cents a pound, and public trams, even for distances as far as ten or twenty miles, only cost five cents. All of these are readily verifiable, and prices were never increased due to the increase in wartime costs to burden the people. The situation in the UK and US today is still the same, which is vastly different from our country. If it is said that the skyrocketing prices in Germany and Russia during the First World War were due to the imbalance of the law of supply and demand and the meddling of control policies, then it would be more accurate to say that it was due to the collapse of the entire economic structure. In other words, when the promotion of control fails to be effective, it proves that the chaos is irrepressible, and the disease has entered the bone marrow.</p>
<p>In short, although various countries have achieved remarkable results after implementing free competition and natural supply and demand systems, this does not mean that the same results cannot be achieved after implementing control. On the contrary, the past experience of abolishing free competition and natural supply and demand shows the benefits of control policies without drawbacks. The future direction of the world economic system is still unpredictable, but the control policy will become the linchpin of the system, and the die is cast. Our country has historically promoted control policies, especially for rice, and therefore has the saying that high grain prices harm the people and low grain prices harm the farmers, and the provinces often use this as a basis for adjusting the people's food supply. Although the food problem has not been solved in the past with the implementation of control, the implementation of free competition in the past thirty years has not seen any certainty in solving the problem. When things reach an extreme, they change, and change leads to progress. Weighing the pros and cons and adapting to the times depends on the authorities' ability to use them well.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Government Spokesman Chiang Ting-fu Issues Statement: Highly Praises the Joint Anglo-American Declaration; Reports on the Harvest Situation in Various Provinces This Year <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – Government spokesman Secretary General Chiang Ting-fu commented on the joint declaration of the US President and British Prime Minister at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the 18th and reported on the harvest situation in various provinces this year. The following is a record of Chiang's remarks. Chiang first stated that the declaration of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill is the basic guideline for the world's post-war transformation. Although only the sixth principle listed in the declaration mentions Nazi tyranny, a careful reading of the entire text reveals that this statement is indeed applicable to the entire world. The current war, although seemingly regional, is in fact one, so the post-war transformation of the world must have a unified guideline, and two sets of solutions cannot be used. The items mentioned in the eight principles, such as all countries having territorial integrity, administrative freedom, and enjoying equal treatment in trade and access to raw materials, are worthy of our attention. If they can be realized one by one, although the lands of various countries may differ in size, the opportunities for economic, cultural, political, and social life within their territories will be equal and unrestricted. In short, in order to realize the declaration of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, all peace-loving democratic countries must make greater sacrifices. Our Foreign Ministry has declared that it will fight to the end in order to continue to contribute to the creation of a new world. Regarding the bumper harvest in various provinces, Chiang said that in Sichuan Province, except for more than a dozen counties, the harvests in all counties have doubled compared to last year. Statistics show that the total rice production in Sichuan Province this year has increased by 15% compared to last year. The amount remaining after farmers pay their land tax (in kind) has exceeded last year's total harvest. In particular, the harvest of miscellaneous grains and sweet potatoes has been especially abundant. Other rice-producing provinces in Jiangnan, except for Hubei, are also showing signs of a bumper harvest. As for the wheat-producing provinces in the north, such as Gansu, Shaanxi, and Henan, the harvest is slightly inferior to previous years. Finally, Chiang reported that the Foreign Exchange Management Committee was established some days ago with 15 members: Kong Xiangxi, Chen Guangfu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Hang, Bei Songsun, Xi Demao, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Xu Kan, Zhang Boling, He Yaozu, Chiang Tingfu, Gu Yiqun, Li Yuannan, and Guo Jinkun. Kong Xiangxi is the chairman, and Chen Guangfu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Hang, Bei Songsun, and Xi Demao are the standing committee members. A plenary committee meeting is held once a month, and a standing committee meeting is held once a week.</p>

News from the Finnish front stated that the Soviet army had destroyed eight bridges, eleven trains, thirty-five aircraft, eighteen tanks, seventy-two transport vehicles, and four armored vehicles in recent days, and killed 480 German and Finnish soldiers and 25 officers.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: The latest Soviet communique admits that Nikolayev on the Black Sea coast and Kryvyi Rih, a major iron ore center, have been lost. The communique stated that after fierce fighting, the Soviet army had withdrawn from these two cities and that the Nikolayev shipyard had been destroyed. There was fierce fighting throughout the line yesterday. On August 16th, a total of 17 enemy aircraft were shot down, and the Soviets also lost 12 aircraft. Soviet submarines in the Black Sea sank two Romanian giant transport ships. The Red Army's organ, Red Star, commented on the telegram from US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill to Stalin, stating that the united alliance of anti-Hitler peoples is a guarantee of victory over fascism. This alliance was formed in the first few days of the German attack on the Soviet Union, and the Red Army's courageous fighting contributed to and strengthened this alliance. The Red Army is currently carrying out its great and glorious mission of destroying fascist barbarism. We are fully satisfied with the assurances provided by Roosevelt and Churchill to Stalin, the head of the Soviet government and People's Commissar for Defense. At a time when the Soviet people and army are doing their best to strike a greater blow against the cunning enemy, the issuance of this telegram is of great significance. The assistance that the United States and Britain plan to provide to the Soviet Union will help this joint effort to defeat Hitlerism. The people currently fighting against fascist savagery still face many difficulties, so it is even more important to ensure the timely and accurate coordination of all efforts in this struggle.</p>
<p>Associated Press dispatch from Berlin on the 18th: German and Hungarian troops, who occupied Nikolayev yesterday, reportedly advanced eastward to the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, constantly pursuing and suppressing the Soviet army. Odessa has reportedly been cut off and is being constantly bombed by the German air force. It is reported that the German army is advancing through the fertile land and mining areas between the Bug and Dnieper Rivers, and the retreating Soviet army is gradually retreating. The number of prisoners and war materials has greatly increased.</p>
<p>TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: The Red Army on the western front achieved an important victory yesterday. The Red Army, led by civilian staff Chai Luofu, surrounded and annihilated a battalion each of German infantry, artillery, and motorized units. 730 German officers and soldiers were killed and 103 were captured. Soviet troops also captured several cannons, three anti-aircraft guns, and twelve machine guns.</p>
<p>Associated Press dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: Last night, an air raid alarm was issued in Moscow for four and a half hours due to a German air raid. However, the official communique stated that small groups of German aircraft were scattered outside the city and none were able to penetrate the defense line. Several aircraft were destroyed. The alarm was issued at 11:30 PM. It was reported that on Saturday night, a German aircraft attempted to fly over Moscow, but was shot down.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: This morning, the Information Bureau issued a battle report stating, "Fierce fighting occurred in all areas of the front line last night." This is the briefest communique issued by the Information Bureau since the start of the German-Soviet war.</p>
<p>Associated Press dispatch from London on the 18th: Authoritative sources in Britain stated today that the German army seems to have relaunched its attack on Leningrad in the Estonian area. The extent of the German army's advance and the intensity of the offensive are currently unknown.</p>
<p>Britain Believes Loss of Nikolayev Has No Particular Significance</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 18th: War critics stated that after the Soviet Union and Germany mobilized millions of troops, thousands of tanks, aircraft, and cannons and fought bloodily for eight weeks, the German army has only now won its first major victory, namely the occupation of the city of Nikolayev on the Black Sea coast. Although this city is not a very large spoil of war and is not as strategically important as Odessa, its loss confirms that the German army has ravaged the southernmost part of Ukraine as far as the mouth of the Dnieper River. However, the port of Odessa is still in Soviet hands, and the German army will inevitably suffer heavy losses if it tries to capture the port by force. In practical terms, the German occupation of Nikolayev can be regarded as a small victory. However, when compared with the previous statements made by the German side, it is not worth mentioning. Four weeks ago, the German radio station broadcast to the world that the Soviet army's resistance had collapsed and the roads to Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev had indeed been opened, and that the vast majority of the Soviet army had been captured or destroyed. However, the three fronts of Leningrad, Moscow, and Kiev are still intact, and the German army was forced to continue its attack south in order to find a weak point and flank the Soviet defenses. The German advance to the southeast ended with the occupation of Nikolayev. However, the Soviet army led by General Butny in that area was still able to avoid encirclement and retreat into the Dnieper Bay, and the crossing was not met with significant losses or disruption. Well-informed sources in London believe that the loss of Nikolayev has no particular significance. The materials left behind by the Soviet army in that port for the German army to use must be minimal, and all ships have been either sailed away or sunk. The situation on the remaining fronts remains unchanged, but there are signs of renewed fighting north of Leningrad in the areas of Keksholm and Smolensk.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: The general impression in Moscow today is that the German army's major offensive in Ukraine is now gradually stalling due to strong Soviet resistance.</p>
<p>Germany Claims Ukrainian Soviet Army Failed to Take Away Large Amounts of Food</p>
<p>Associated Press dispatch from Vichy on the 18th: German sources here declared yesterday that Germany's offensive into Ukraine and the Dnieper River region has obtained large quantities of food for the Axis countries' warehouse. The main items looted by the Germans were cattle, sheep, pigs, and unharvested and harvested wheat. German sources claimed that these items were not quickly taken away due to the Soviet Union's lack of transportation. They also claimed that large quantities of food were stored along the river, ready to be transported. They further claimed that the German army had five hundred harvesters and countless agricultural experts when entering Ukraine, and immediately harvested wheat several miles behind the front lines. They also said that the retreating Soviet army in Ukraine did not cause destruction, unlike in Poland and the Belarus region.</p>

<p>Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 18th: According to Zens News Agency, the great wave of anti-fascist activity is now spreading across Europe. Fierce struggles are currently taking place in Yugoslavia and Croatia. In some places, anti-fascist factions have open conflicts with local garrisons, fascist youth parties, and police. Prisoners in the Travnik concentration camp in Bosnia rebelled, disarmed the guards, and escaped. The authorities immediately sent troops to the camp and opened fire on the prisoners with machine guns, and 42 people were sentenced to death by a military court. In recent days, a large number of people have been executed. In Travnik alone, there have been as many as 100 people. There have also been large numbers of executions in central Serbia. Two anti-fascists in Sarajevo were executed for distributing pamphlets issued by the Moscow Pan-Slavic Conference calling on the Slavic people to attack fascism. Poles are secretly listening to the broadcasts of this conference and appeals with great ingenuity, so they are now widely circulating throughout Poland.</p>

<p>Taiwan Public News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 18th: President Roosevelt has returned to his desk in the White House today. He will implement the recent agreement with Britain and the assurances to the Soviet Union to increase American aid. It is believed that the President's first step will focus on the strained US-Japan relations and the need to accelerate the delivery of supplies to the Soviet Union. Some observers believe that the government's announcement that a tanker carrying aviation gasoline has set sail for Vladivostok is intended to test Japan's reaction to the transportation of aid supplies to the Soviet Union via the Pacific. The matters currently awaiting the President's handling are as follows: (1) Japan refuses to allow the US ship President Coolidge to transport American expatriates stranded in Japan; (2) Select a representative to attend the conference on British and American aid to the Soviet Union to be held in Moscow. It is believed that the US representative will be Lend-Lease Coordinator Harriman, stationed in London; (3) Decide whether to take over the Kearny Shipyard, which has been hit by a strike, halting the Navy's shipbuilding program; (4) Plan to accelerate defense production to meet the Soviet Union's new needs, eliminate friction, and centralize management; (5) Request additional funds from Congress to aid democratic countries, estimated to be between US$60 billion and US$120 billion; (6) Sign various important bills, including the bill extending the service period of conscripted National Guard and Reserve troops by 18 months; (7) Review the relationship between the United States and Vichy after Petain announced a closer relationship between France and Germany.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Hopkins to Manage the Transportation of Military Supplies to the Soviet Union <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 18th (Associated Press) - Reliable sources have revealed that President Roosevelt's pledge to aid the Soviet Union by accelerating the shipment of American military supplies may be managed by Hopkins. However, this aid will not be implemented under the Lend-Lease Act. It is now beyond doubt that the executive branch intends to put into action the promises made in the letter from Roosevelt and Churchill to Stalin. Informed sources say that aircraft, artillery, and other military equipment will be shipped to the Soviet Union as quickly as possible. It is widely believed that the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting's decision to provide greater and faster aid to Britain and the Soviet Union has prompted the United States to reconsider its entire military production program. The British Minister of Supply, Lord Beaverbrook, is currently in Washington providing American officials with a new list of British needs for military equipment and food. With the needs of Britain and the Soviet Union being so vast, the existing production facilities will inevitably need to be expanded further. Government officials suggest that the new Lend-Lease program will require at least one trillion US dollars. It is said that the Army and Navy Departments have been ordered to prepare to provide all available materials to the Soviet military delegation currently in Washington. It is also reported that government officials, given the vastness and resources of the Soviet Union, have not yet considered applying the Lend-Lease Act to the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt is believed to believe that a steady flow of American goods is necessary to encourage Soviet resistance. The President also believes that if the Soviet Union can defeat the German army, the end of the war will come several years earlier than if the Soviet Union were to be defeated. Preparations are reportedly underway to send high-ranking military and supply representatives to Moscow. It is widely believed that individuals with cabinet-level positions may also be sent. The shipment of gasoline, aircraft, and other supplies to the Soviet Union will be handled immediately and will not await the conclusion of this meeting.</p>

<p>London, 18th (Reuters) - It was officially announced this morning that Prime Minister Churchill and his entourage, after meeting with the US President at sea last week, safely returned to Britain this morning aboard the battleship Prince of Wales. It is reported that Churchill landed in Iceland on his way back and inspected British and American troops.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters) - Details of Prime Minister Churchill's departure from Britain have now been released. It is said that the Prime Minister departed from London by train and boarded a destroyer at a certain British port. Naval personnel and others at the port were sworn to secrecy regarding the Prime Minister's trip and were unaware of his destination. As the destroyer set sail, the Prime Minister stood on the bridge, with a cigar in his mouth, appearing very pleased. After the Prime Minister reached the sea on the destroyer, he transferred to the flagship HMS King George V, met with Admiral Tovey, Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, and had lunch. He then transferred to the Prince of Wales and set off on a journey across the Atlantic. It is now known that several destroyers from the Home Fleet also set sail to escort him.</p>

<p>London, 18th (Reuters) - The film of Roosevelt and Churchill's meeting at sea has now been flown to London. A preview was shown to journalists last night, but many important parts were not shown. The first scene showed Churchill's initial meeting with the US President. Churchill boarded the American ship wearing a travel hat and with a cigar in his mouth. Upon seeing the US President, he shook hands in greeting. Churchill's first words were, "Good morning, how are you?" He then handed a letter from the King to the US President. The film also showed the two men sitting in the cabin of the British ship Prince of Wales holding prayers. In addition, there were scenes of 200 American sailors being invited to board the British ship, bringing gifts prepared by the President, such as cigarettes, fruits, and cheese, to distribute to the British sailors, showing mutual friendship. However, the actual meetings were not shown on screen. According to a naval officer who accompanied them, the two men spent most of their time in private talks in the President's office on the deck of the American ship.</p>

<p>Boat Trip on the North River</p>
<p>The military arranged for us a truck, which drove to the Shaoguan Hotel. This car needed two people to drive, a driver and a mechanic. The mechanic's job was to crank the engine, jump off the car when it went downhill, and put wooden blocks behind the rear wheels, and to negotiate with people if there were obstacles in the road. The mechanic had tuberculosis, and his coughing corresponded to the driver's mucus membrane cough. The back of the vehicle was piled with luggage, as well as three accompanying military officers and four guards, all of whom were thin, silent, and wore faded cotton uniforms.</p>
<p>Our guards carried rifles, grenades, box cannons, etc. Although they were only about nineteen years old, they looked eleven or twelve years older. They were all very kind and humble and borrowed our thermos twice to get hot water.</p>
<p>The mud road was light yellow in the foggy and rainy weather. We passed through villages and saw square stone forts, where farmers had taken refuge from bandits, but under bombing, this place was no longer a place to hide. We passed rice fields with gray mud, and barefoot farmers tilled the land behind a bald-haired water buffalo. The trees here were lush, the mountain peaks were sharp, and there were shrubs that blossomed like honeysuckle. After driving for two hours, we had reached a section of the road that was not very smooth. The driver hunched over the steering wheel, suffering from coughing. We used all our strength, holding onto the car window with one hand and bracing ourselves against the roof with the other. The vehicle drove through the mud, with many mud holes on the road. The car jumped, and the shaking was extremely violent. The driver and mechanic coughed, spat, and talked to each other in murmurs.</p>
<p>We drove to the top of a mountain and stopped at the edge of a village. We had traveled thirty-five miles in three hours, and after that, there was no road to be found. A group of people followed the porters carrying luggage to the mud bank. We comfortably boarded the deck of a gasoline boat and sat on the boat hooks and ropes. This boat had to be pumped every two hours to avoid sinking. The hull was extremely rotten and could be broken with a fist. The cabin was dirty and smelly, as expected. This was the only gasoline boat on the North River.</p>
<p>Everyone and everything was on board, and we sailed into the river, towing a civilian boat behind us, twice the size of the gasoline boat. This civilian boat was divided into several sections with bamboo mats. In the boat were our guards, three military officers, and the boat owner's family—two men, two children, two women, and a newborn baby, who cried very loudly. The mother tied the baby to her back to cook, which made the crying a little better.</p>
<p>Many civilian boats with broken brown sails were sailing downstream, and heavily loaded boats sailing upstream were using poles or ropes to pull themselves along. The Chinese method of boating was either to bend over and brace the bamboo pole with their shoulders or to pull the heavy boats with ropes. A line of men, women, and children slowly moved the heavy cargo ship forward with ropes. They sang and shouted as they pulled hard, and the sound waves floated across the water like undulating wails.</p>
<p>Arrival at Destination</p>
<p>There are three waterways leading to this front line where there is no road to choose, and the North River is one of them. The helmsman on the gasoline boat was an old man with sparse white hair, a few yellow teeth, a small black velvet rope hat, and a long tobacco pipe. He sat cross-legged on a high chair next to the steering wheel and grabbed a bowl of white rice with chopsticks and stuffed it into his mouth. Then he sipped a spoonful of soup, breathed a sigh of satisfaction, and spat out a mouthful of phlegm out the window. His little grandson handed him the tobacco pipe. His grandson was a very interesting fellow, also wearing the same velvet rope hat and the same contemplative face. The grandson slept on the smelly toilet at the front and spent most of his time using a pump to pump water out of the boat.</p>
<p>At this time, the rope towing the civilian boat, which was thick enough to tie a package, suddenly broke. It was now four thirty in the afternoon, time for dinner, so the civilian boat used bamboo poles to pull alongside, and we crossed over to that boat, sat on the deck, swished our chopsticks in the boiling water for a while, and began our first meal of the day. At six o'clock, it was dark, the guards had fallen asleep, and the officers were wearing long robes, curled up on the civilian boat's deck. We returned to the fresh air of the deck.</p>
<p>We traveled in the lightless night, and as dawn approached, the steamboat was about to run aground. The helmsman's son stood at the bow, using a boat hook to measure the depth of the water. He sang to the helmsman in a melodic voice: "Two feet, two and a half feet, two feet," reporting slowly, until he encountered the second sandbar. We ran aground five times, and eventually everyone got confused. The civilian boat overtook us and went ahead. The helmsman admitted that there was nothing he could do, so he steered us close to the shore, where there were at least forty civilian boats docked. As we approached, we immediately heard their voices, smelled a breath, and had a lot of mosquitoes. Hemingway found these houseboat dwellers very interesting.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Stabilization Fund Announces Measures to Manage Shanghai Foreign Exchange Market; Exchange Rates for British and US Currencies Have Been Set at Levels; Applications for Supply Can Be Made for Legitimate Needs <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The United States and Britain announced the freezing of Japanese assets. At the same time, at the request of the Chinese government, the freezing of Chinese assets aims to assist the Chinese government, control foreign exchange, manage trade, and extend its powers to Shanghai and other occupied areas to prevent funds from falling into Japanese hands, eliminate foreign exchange speculation, and stabilize the status of the legal tender. However, since the announcement of the freeze order, everything has failed to achieve the expected ideals. The Chinese government authorized the Stabilization Fund to take appropriate steps. The fund, with extreme caution, sent Chang to conduct on-the-spot investigations and thoroughly study the foreign exchange situation in Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai to determine countermeasures. Recently, due to the mischief of speculators, the Shanghai black market has shrunk sharply, and unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to raise prices, which has greatly threatened people's livelihoods. Dr. Taylor, the assistant of the American member of the Stabilization Fund, Mr. Fox, witnessed this situation in Shanghai and could not allow it to continue. After repeated consultations with the Stabilization Fund, the fund began to implement its stabilization work yesterday. According to reports from the Da Zhong News Agency, importers engaged in legitimate trade are allowed to supply at the level of US$5.3125 and £3 1/5625 pence. Since the announcement of this measure at around 9:00 am yesterday, importers have suddenly obtained more favorable exchange rates for settlement, and people's hearts have been greatly encouraged. Affected by this, the price of gold closed at 6,795 yuan yesterday, a decrease of 453 yuan compared to last week. It is expected that prices will inevitably fall as a result, and speculative behavior will also tend to disappear.</p>
<p>Stabilization Committee Revises Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Before taking this step yesterday, the Stabilization Fund sent a message to the branches of 14 foreign banks in the city, specially approving the supply of foreign exchange according to the new exchange rate. The original text reads: "From August 18, 1941 (ie, Monday), the Stabilization Fund Committee will supply spot US dollars at an exchange rate of 5.34375 yuan to banks approved under Notes 59 and 61 of the US Treasury Department to engage in legitimate import trade with China. The settlement and sale of this foreign exchange must be in accordance with the provisions of General Note 58 of the United States.</p>
<p>Detailed Regulations for Application</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned banks need to replenish the foreign exchange sold, the Hong Kong office or agency of each bank should submit an application to the temporary office of the fund at Nos. 104, 105, and 106, HSBC Building, Hong Kong, and submit a document containing the following conditions: This bank or agency, on behalf of the applicant, hereby undertakes to provide your committee with three copies of the application form signed by Andang within two weeks. If your committee subsequently discovers that the settled foreign exchange is used for various import businesses not specified in the first paragraph, or for the import of goods listed in the embargo regulations promulgated by the Chinese Customs Authority on July 4, 1939, and subsequently revised and added, we also agree to sell the settled foreign exchange again. The replenishment of US dollar sales can be handled by the applicant's branch or agency in Hong Kong. If we receive notification from your committee stating that the amount applied for has been prepared, this branch or agency will immediately issue a certificate to your committee in the usual verified manner, stating that the equivalent amount of legal tender has been..." The message has been sent to the Shanghai offices of Citibank and Chase Bank.</p>
<p>Market Morale Greatly Encouraged</p>
<p>According to the above announcement, it is only known that the Stabilization Fund has stipulated that the US dollar exchange rate for importers engaged in legitimate trade is 5.34375 yuan. However, the level set for the British pound exchange rate has not been stated in writing. However, according to reports from Da Zhong News Agency, the Stabilization Fund has also stipulated that the British pound exchange rate is 3 1/5625 pence at the same time. This was told by a senior staff member of Mercantile Bank and should not be regarded as a false rumor. It is said that the purpose of this move by the Stabilization Fund is to stabilize the foreign exchange market, consolidate the status of the legal tender, and maintain the import of essential goods in the city according to this official standard. However, it does not provide for speculative transactions and restricts them from engaging in trade with Japanese merchants in the city or the Japanese headquarters according to this new exchange rate. In the past few weeks, the market's required positions have been mainly importers engaged in legitimate business. However, due to speculators vying for purchases and Japanese banks secretly covering short positions, the British and American exchange rates have shrunk sharply, and there have been losses. Today, after the Stabilization Fund announced the official US dollar standard, they were suddenly able to settle foreign exchange at a more favorable exchange rate. As a result, the morale of the entire market has been greatly encouraged. (According to the new exchange rate, one US dollar is equivalent to 18.82 yuan in legal tender.)</p>
<p>Supply of Foreign Exchange Limited to Essential Goods</p>
<p>The Stabilization Fund Committee's announcement yesterday did not mention the goods for which foreign exchange should be settled. We must limit ourselves to non-luxury goods. However, according to the Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Times announced by the Ministry of Finance on July 1, 1939, the customs tariff numbers for 18 groups and 234 tax rules are listed, such as foreign wine, canned fruits, vegetables, and luxury wool goods, cotton goods, wood, paper, bamboo, rattan ware, stone products, and liquid fuels with available substitutes are all prohibited from import and transshipment, or import via parcel post from overseas. The Shanghai Customs has not complied due to the special environment. However, if the above-mentioned prohibited goods are imported by Shanghai Customs in the future, the supply of foreign exchange will be suspended. In other words, foreign exchange can be applied for for imported goods, but only for essential goods. Speculators who pretend to be importers will be strictly rejected.</p>

<p>Coal ball prices have been particularly chaotic in recent days. The French Concession authorities assessed a price of 16 yuan per dan (unit of weight) in the previous week. After being broken by six jiao (1/10 of a yuan) recently, there are rumors that the price will increase by another 12 yuan per ton and 6 jiao per dan starting today.

<p>Large Factories Withdraw from the Association Without Legal Basis</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association held an executive supervisory meeting at its meeting place on Tianjin Road at 4:00 pm yesterday to discuss various issues. Those present were Chen Cuifang, Mao Chunpu, and all executive supervisory committee members. Chairman Chen Cuifang then discussed: (1) The case of seven coal ball factories, including Yitaixing, withdrawing from the association. It was resolved that there was no legal basis for this and that it was difficult to approve. They were asked to maintain the association and pay the arrears. (2) A statement was published in the newspaper stating the association's position and requesting that every effort be made to supply the association's small factories with raw materials so that production could be increased and prices would not be raised due to panic. (3) The two concession authorities were requested to be notified by the association's official letter of the wholesale price of coal balls from each factory in the future and not to raise prices without authorization. (4) The holding of flat-price coal balls was resolved to be discussed after the disputes between the factories were resolved.

<p>In order to make it clear to the outside world the manufacturing costs of coal balls for large and small coal ball factories, the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association estimated the manufacturing costs of coal balls for each factory yesterday as follows: Water feet vary, 13 yuan, mine price, 2 yuan, total 15 yuan (US dollars), equivalent to 285 yuan in national currency, plus outside expenses of 20 yuan in national currency, which is 305 yuan. Ordinary coal balls use 70% Hongji coal fines, valued at 213.5 yuan, and 30% Hailing fines, valued at 51 yuan, totaling 264.5 yuan in national currency. Calculated at a discount of 96%, it only equals 253.5 yuan in national currency, plus a yellow mud fee of 2.5 yuan, which is 256 yuan. Plus manufacturing costs: (1) Those who have a contract with the Kailuan Mining Bureau pay only 15 yuan per ton for manufacturing costs, for a total cost of 281 yuan per ton. (2) Those who do not have a contract with the Kailuan Mining Bureau (small factories) pay 45 yuan per ton for manufacturing costs, for a total cost of 301 yuan per ton. However, based on yesterday's exchange rate, this number is not needed.</p>
<h3 id="e38">A Glimpse of Japan's Attitude Towards the Thai Issue <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Special Cable from Whitene, Japan Correspondent for the North China Daily News) - It is claimed that a senior official of the Japanese government once told him that Japan's attitude towards Southeast Asia can be symbolized by the joint defense agreement signed with French Indochina. The so-called defense will continue to be maintained unless Japan is forced to choose another attitude. It was also stated that if British Foreign Secretary Eden had stated that Thailand had a deep interest in British affairs, Japan also recognizes that Thailand's position is equally important to Japan and will not allow various schemes to make Thailand a pawn against Japan. Japan's intention in Southeast Asia is entirely peaceful, except for planning a final battle with Chongqing. However, it continued to say that Japan could not ignore Britain's recent provocative military preparations, as these preparations began long before Japan signed the joint defense agreement with Vietnam.</p>

In view of this, the Russian expatriates in this port have cooperated with the XCDN Moonlight Drama Society to bring one of its greatest entertainment productions to the stage. People in this port who are inclined towards democratic countries should take this opportunity to express their sympathy to the Russian victims of Nazi aggression.

<h3 id="e40">Affected by the International Situation, Some Japanese Merchants Suspend Business; A Total of 53 Cases Last Month, But Waitresses and Geishas Are Still Flourishing <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Recently, many small and medium-sized Japanese merchants in Shanghai have mostly become partners of large capital operators and employees of salaried classes. Those who remain have also voluntarily suspended business due to operational difficulties. According to statistics from the Japanese Consulate Police Department, a total of 53 businesses were suspended in July, including cafes, tea shops, restaurants, grocery stores, trading companies, etc. As for female occupations, such as waitresses and geishas, they are still flourishing. Currently, Japanese shops in Hongkou have reached an important fork in the road, and all parties are discussing countermeasures. It is said that the Economic Department of the Japanese Consulate Police Department is actively eliminating bad businesses and cracking down on unscrupulous merchants.</p>

<p>With the tense situation in the Pacific, there is talk of Japanese expatriates in Southeast Asia starting to withdraw. According to foreign merchants and shipping circles, a small number of Japanese expatriates have indeed set off to return to their country. It is reported that the French company's General Joffre steamer is coming to Shanghai from Saigon, and after these Japanese expatriates arrive in Shanghai, whether they will transfer to a ship to return to their country or stay in the city has not been confirmed. The General Joffre steamer also brought 5,000 bags of Saigon rice to Shanghai, and the ship is berthed at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf. The previous rumor that the General Joffre Road was detained by the Dutch East Indies authorities has been proven to be untrue. Before US-French relations completely break down, French postal vessels will not stop at Manila port.</p>
<h3 id="e42">American Missionary in Huai'an Detained: Japanese Claim Leakage of Military Intelligence, Shanghai American Presbyterian Church Does Not Believe It; Japanese Deny Rumors of Wells' Murder <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The "China Press" reports that, according to Tong Meng News Agency, the Japanese Army Information Bureau in Shanghai yesterday afternoon (17th) firmly denied the news that an American female missionary was strangled to death by the Japanese army in Huai'an, northern Jiangsu. They claimed that the Japanese Army authorities here, after receiving a detailed report from the commander of the Japanese troops fighting in the Huai'an area, stated that the rumors of a beautiful female missionary being strangled to death or other American missionaries being detained were</p>
<p>Absolutely Untrue</p>
<p>According to official information from Huai'an, when the Japanese army was fighting the New Fourth Army in that area, they suspected that military intelligence of value was being transmitted through the American Presbyterian Church in Huai'an. Therefore, on July 31st, the Japanese army dispatched a lieutenant colonel to begin an investigation. They discovered that the church's hospital was being used by the New Fourth Army at will to collect intelligence on Japanese military operations. They also learned that 19 wounded soldiers of the New Fourth Army being treated in the hospital, except for three, had left before the Japanese army captured the city. Furthermore, they discovered that among the hospital staff was the daughter of a certain New Fourth Army officer who was constantly</p>
<p>Supplying Information</p>
<p>to the Chinese army. After the Japanese lieutenant colonel completed his investigation, he met with a representative of the American Presbyterian Church in Huai'an on August 14th. The representative then handed a letter to the Japanese army, acknowledging the points raised by the Japanese and apologizing on behalf of the church. The Japanese Army authorities warned them not to repeat such incidents, and the matter was dropped. Last night, members of the American Presbyterian Church in Shanghai stated that they did not believe the Japanese claims that the church's staff in Huai'an were supplying military intelligence to the Chinese army. There was only one female staff member in the Huai'an church, and the recent rumors of her being harmed were not true, but the woman had been</p>
<p>Confined to Her Home</p>
<p>by the military. People from Shanghai recently went to Huai'an to meet with the woman and have since returned to Shanghai. The Japanese reported to the American Consul General in Shanghai yesterday that the staff of the American Church in Qingjiangpu, northern Jiangsu, had been released on Saturday. The American consulate then informed the American Church in Shanghai that the staff of the Jiangpu American Church had been detained since July 31st and were not allowed to meet with any outsiders and had insufficient food. The Japanese army also posted notices in front of the hospital where these missionaries served, stating that the Japanese army was closing the hospital as retaliation for American policies. The English-language "China Press" also reported that eight American missionaries and one child from the American Presbyterian Church in Qingjiangpu were confined by the Japanese army on the upper floor of a house for</p>
<p>Sixteen Days</p>
<p>and were reportedly released and were relatively free. However, the American Presbyterian Church in Shanghai had not yet received confirmation of the release of these missionaries. The news of the release was only the notification from the American consulate after receiving a report from the Japanese authorities yesterday. It was also heard that Ms. Wells, the beautiful female missionary in Huai'an, was still safe and sound and was only confined to her home. The previous rumors that she had been strangled to death were inaccurate, but it was still unknown whether Ms. Wells was still under detention.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Children Without Fathers: Living on Pensions - Ten Interviews for Scholarship Assistance <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The young man surnamed Chen is already ten years old and will only be in the first year of high school next semester. He dropped out of school for a considerable period to escape the war. His father, who worked at the National Bank of Nanjing, unfortunately passed away after the war. His mother received a pension of 5,000 yuan. His mother, maternal grandparents, and two younger brothers and sisters barely survive on this pension. The money will be used up in a few years. Now, a manager of a local bank, a good friend of his father during his lifetime, is helping him. The situation is quite tragic.</p>
<p>A Miss Shui's father was an employee of a certain bank's Zhejiang branch and unfortunately passed away three years ago. He left behind six or seven children. Now they rely on a monthly pension of 100 yuan (minus 4 yuan for income tax) from the bank to maintain their lives. This Miss Shui is now a senior in the kindergarten normal school. The school waived her tuition fee of 20 yuan in the first half of the year. One younger brother is in a vocational school, and another is in elementary school. The difficulty of their lives can be imagined.</p>
<p>Pitiable Children</p>
<p>The thirteen-year-old child surnamed Qiao was in the first year of junior high school at Zhaoguang Middle School last school year. During the summer, he was admitted to the Civil Engineering Department of the second year of junior high school at the China Vocational School. Although the application form stated that there were three people in the family, mother and son, in fact, his older brother was far away in Chongqing, working as an electrical technician, which was only enough to maintain his personal life. He and his mother lived in the stairwell of a relative's house, which was dark and sunless. He couldn't help but cry when he told his story. His grades were not satisfactory because he couldn't study in the stairwell, and he had to work for others after school, so he had very little opportunity to study on his own. If this poor child is not helped, he will not have the opportunity to acquire better living knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>A seventeen-year-old child, you cannot see anything special about him on his application form, only that his relationship with his parent or guardian is uncle-nephew. It turns out that he is an orphan. His parents passed away a long time ago, and four brothers also died one after another. This is truly a tragic event! He now relies on his uncle for a living. His uncle works as a receptionist in a private hospital. It is certainly difficult for this kind of occupation's salary to support his nephew's tuition. This child is now in the second year of vocational high school in the mechanical engineering department. Studying specialized technology is the most suitable for him in terms of survival. (T)</p>
<p>Diligent Female Student</p>
<p>A female student in the high school department, she has excellent grades, but she does not relax because of her good grades, but continues to study diligently. When I went to visit, she was in the living room working on her summer homework, which further confirmed that her usual excellent grades were not accidental. She was originally a boarding student, and her family lived in her hometown. Because it was summer vacation, she temporarily lived in the home of a fairly wealthy relative, accompanying the two children in the relative's home to tutor them in summer studies.</p>
<p>She wore simple clothes. She had a modest attitude and spoke elegantly. She had a ten-minute conversation with me. During the conversation, I learned about her family's situation: she was originally an "only daughter" without brothers or sisters, and her family had lived in the countryside of Guo County for generations. They had more than ten acres of land and several rural houses. Her father was able to manage the family diligently and frugally, so they could be considered a well-off family before the war. Since the outbreak of the war, her hometown was occupied, the area was not peaceful, and the family's economy was severely hit. She could not stand the false alarms, panic, and the blow of being out of school, so she fled to Shanghai alone to study, boarding at the school. On holidays, she occasionally lived in the home of a relatively close relative. However, the cost of her studying in Shanghai was a major expense, but she was unwilling to drop out of school and did not want to add to the worries of her elderly parents. She could not live in her relative's house permanently, so she decided to apply to this newspaper for part of the tuition. Finally, I asked her if that relative could help, but she did not answer and showed an embarrassed expression.</p>
<p>I obtained the above results and wrote a report truthfully. As for whether to give assistance to that young woman who is not poor but very studious, that is beyond my responsibility. (C)</p>

<p>The investigation of applicants for the two groups of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund, college and middle school students, has been completed long ago. The review team carefully studied it yesterday based on the investigation report. It has also been finalized after three hours and submitted to the committee for final review and decision at 4 pm today. It will be announced successively from tomorrow. I hope all applicants will pay special attention. As for the free places specially set up by this newspaper for Yu Hua, Jing Zhi, Zheng Zhong, and Xin Jian four middle schools, the number of applicants was extremely enthusiastic until yesterday. The registration will be closed at noon today, and there will be no further accommodations for latecomers. Yesterday, Tongde Middle School sent a letter to set up a free place for this newspaper, and their enthusiasm is commendable, but this newspaper believes that the scholarship work for this semester is coming to an end, and it is planned to handle it next semester.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic People Show Old-Fashioned Generosity</p>
<p>Yesterday, donations reached more than a thousand yuan. Among them, there are three good intentions that can be described: (1) Mr. Mao Aitang of Dasheng Silk Village wrote in a letter, "Every time I read newspapers and periodicals, they carry the righteous deeds of scholarship funds, loan funds, etc. Although the methods are different, the main purpose is to benefit children from poor families. They are truly different paths to the same goal. I privately admire the good measures of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund. It is the height of summer, and it is the 50th birthday of Mrs. Shen, the mother of the late King. I have the honor to be half a son, so I have proposed to raise a glass to wish her a long life. However, the birthday mother has always been kind and compassionate. In view of the national crisis and the people's suffering, she resolutely rejected all unnecessary extravagance and wished to do things that would benefit the people. I obeyed my mother's instructions and responded to my heart, so I transferred my personal birthday gift of 500 yuan to the Jinbao Readers' Scholarship Fund to inspire outstanding students from poor families and to create happiness for my birthday mother." (2) In addition to Mr. Shen Baoqi's generous donation of 200 yuan, Wang Yueming of Yihua Foreign Company's import department, his daughter, little sister Wang Ronghua, is one year old, and her relatives and friends gave her many gifts. Mr. Wang did not dare to spend too much because the world is in turmoil, so he specially saved 200 yuan for the scholarship fund and named it "Wang Ronghua's First Birthday Commemoration." (3) On the anniversary of "August 13th", Mr. Cao Zhiyu of Lixin Hardware Store on Zhejiang Road explained the meaning of the Shenbao Scholarship Fund to colleagues in the hardware and iron trade contact office in Tongle Garden Teahouse on Xiamen Road, and then donated 30 yuan himself and raised 120 yuan. The enthusiasm of people from all walks of life to help students is admirable.</p>
<p>Donations Were Very Enthusiastic Yesterday</p>
<p>The titles of the gentlemen who donated yesterday are recorded as follows: Mr. Mao Aitang's birthday gift to Mrs. Shen, mother of the late King, 500 yuan, Mr. Shen Baoqi 200 yuan, Wang Ronghua's first birthday commemoration 200 yuan, Lichang Company colleagues 50 yuan, Lixin Hardware Store Cao Zhiyu 30 yuan, Cao raised 120 yuan from his colleagues (including Li Rujin 30 yuan, Zhang Yisheng 30 yuan, Shi Jiuxiang 10 yuan, Zhang Mingshui 5 yuan, Qian Genchun 5 yuan, Zhu Ruichu 5 yuan, Wu Caizhang 5 yuan, Yang Yuchun 5 yuan, Chen Xianshun 5 yuan, Tang Xingsheng 5 yuan, Wu Hanqing 5 yuan, Luo Maoliang 5 yuan, Lou Yunzhou 5 yuan), Zhuan Jiaowan 16 yuan, Xi Nan (manuscript fee) 9 yuan, anonymous 2 yuan and 1 jiao, Tang Youmei (manuscript fee) 1 yuan, the above totals 1,128 yuan and 1 jiao, previous balance 51,729 yuan, 4 jiao and 1 fen, total 52,857 yuan, 5 jiao and 1 fen</p>

<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that Tedelpon, the former executive officer of the U.S. Court in Shanghai, was arrested nine days ago for the crime of stealing public property and was imprisoned in the Ward Road Western Prison because he could not afford the bail of US$5,000. Currently, U.S. Commissioner Helmick is on a trip to the United States and has not yet returned to Shanghai. Therefore, Court Prosecutor Hiltz has commissioned lawyer Nelson or Commissioner Ruden of the American Consulate as temporary commissioner to try Tedelpon. It is currently awaiting approval from President Roosevelt and the consent of Commissioner Helmick. According to Hiltz, President Roosevelt has just returned to the White House after meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill at sea, so the appointment of the temporary commissioner is expected to receive President Roosevelt's reply in three days. If approved, the trial can be opened, but the date of the trial cannot be predicted. Tedelpon requested the court to appoint a lawyer to defend him, but the court consulted with many lawyers in the city, and none of them agreed to take on the case. The court will appoint another lawyer to defend Tedelpon when preparing for the formal trial.</p>

<p>Yulong Store at 1559 Jiaozhou Road, West Shanghai, was suddenly broken into by several robbers at 10:45 pm last night. They threatened with guns and robbed more than 200 yuan in legal tender before fleeing outside with the loot. Wang Yurui, the owner of the store, 29 years old, from Shaoxing, pursued them, shouting for help. The robbers immediately pulled out their guns and opened fire, hitting Wang in the right chest. The bullet did not penetrate. He fell to the ground injured. The robbers escaped into the darkness without a trace. Wang Yurui was taken to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is reported that he was seriously injured and his life was in danger.</p>

<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that seven armed robbers in the Hongkou district last night (17th) planned to rob a Japanese shop on Bazilu Road near North Sichuan Road and were captured by the Japanese Naval Authorities and the Military Police. They are still in detention. It is reported that the Japanese authorities</p>
<p>Received a Tip-Off in Advance</p>
<p>and were prepared at the scene. After a while, seven robbers arrived in a car and broke into the Japanese shop. The Japanese Navy and Military Police immediately surrounded them. The robbers, realizing that the situation was hopeless, opened fire. The Japanese soldiers returned fire. More than fifteen shots were exchanged. The robbers were eventually captured. Bridges over the Suzhou River were blocked at the time. It was rumored that a Chinese man was stabbed with a bayonet during the arrest, but this was reportedly untrue. Another report states that at 8:20 pm last night (17th),</p>
<p>During a Heavy Rain</p>
<p>seven men carrying weapons were riding in rickshaws when they were encountered by a Japanese Marine patrol on Bazilu Road. The patrol attempted to search them, but the men got out of the rickshaws and fled towards Hesketh Road. The Japanese soldiers pursued them, and the men fired at the Japanese soldiers while fleeing. The Japanese soldiers also opened fire. The sound of gunfire was as dense as a string of pearls. Nearby residents were</p>
<p>Shocked and Fearful</p>
<p>As a result, the Japanese soldiers chased and captured four people in front of the China Iron Club, two people at the entrance of Anqing Lane, and one person at the corner of Anfu Lane.

<p>The Christian Orphanage, located on Columbia Road, was originally run by American church members, with Mrs. Maine as the person in charge. It currently houses 50 children and occupies several acres of land with many self-built houses. Since the intensification of the international situation, American expatriates in Shanghai have been withdrawing one after another. The orphanage is now run by a board of directors organized by Chinese church members. The current people in charge are Chairman Li Baiqiang, Vice Chairman Huang Lanyu, Secretary Xu Shaoshan, Accountant Gao Junzhe, Inspectors Jiang Lisheng and Lin Yuqiong. A manager is also hired to reside in the orphanage and be responsible for management. Currently, the orphanage's children are provided with rice and wheat by the American Red Cross. In addition to the church's allocation, the monthly expenses are raised by the directors. Because a large number of orphans and refugees are being sent from all sides, such as the poor children sheltered by the Public Works Department's Child Protection Section, who are now also being sent to the orphanage, the dormitory space is becoming crowded. There are recent plans to raise funds for additional construction to expand capacity and benefit the children. If anyone has any suggestions or would like to send refugee children, please contact Li Baiqiang at 117B, Securities Building, 422 Hankou Road at any time.</p>

<p>The American Hengda Foreign Company Machinery Lathe Manufacturing Factory at the intersection of Daxilu Road and Dunxin Road employs a total of 350 workers. Recently, due to traffic obstruction in various places and the customs and Japanese restrictions on the transportation of machinery and goods to the interior, the business has suffered a major blow. Therefore, it was decided to close down. This was suddenly implemented on the 11th of this month, but the issue of the workers' welfare was ignored. On the 10th, all the workers went to the factory to petition the factory manager, requesting to continue operations in order to maintain the workers' livelihood, or to pay severance pay for dismissal in order to seek other employment. However, the company made no specific statement on this. The workers had no choice but to request again the next day, but they still did not get results. After a full assembly, the workers elected Ji Ziqing, Wang Ailai, Yang Liangchen, Li Guanglin, and Zhang Jiantang as general representatives, responsible for negotiating with the factory, and decided to start a hunger strike today to urge the factory to realize the situation. At the same time, they appealed to all sectors for sympathy and assistance.</p>

This morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court. The police station lawyer, Ru Baoyi, filed a lawsuit for embezzlement.

<p>Yang Weiquan, a famous painter from ancient Fujian, is a veteran modern Chinese painter. His masterpiece, "Ashes of Brocade," melts all things into one furnace, showing different colors and unique features, exquisite and unparalleled, forming its own mechanism. Since Qian Shunju of the Yuan Dynasty spread the "Ashes of Brocade," there are almost no comparable works in the modern world. Chinese and foreign people who obtain even a small piece of his work regard it as a treasure. Recently, due to old age and illness, he only limits himself to making one fan painting per day and one scroll painting per ten days. It is said that this spring there is a new rule of doubling the price, probably to slightly reduce the amount of painting in the midst of endless requests. However, those who seek his work still come endlessly. Therefore, he has newly established a limit on the number of pieces accepted, in order of arrival, without accepting any that require immediate completion, hoping to be understood. He also plans to increase the price again during the Mid-Autumn Festival of the old lunar calendar.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Finance: It Was Truly Unexpected for Speculation: A Bolt from the Blue in the Foreign Exchange Market: The HSBC Listing Suddenly Saw a Sharp Increase, But It Lacked Momentum and the Dark Market Even Loosened by Eighteen Notches: Anglo-American Re-emerged, Exceeding the Three-Office and Five-Yuan Thresholds <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: At 9:30 a.m. HSBC, because the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee had notified the British HSBC, McGarrett, and Youli, the American Citibank Datong, and the four banks of Zhongzhong Jiaonong to earnestly cooperate in stabilizing the black market exchange rate and provide foreign exchange as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries, the listing suddenly rose unexpectedly. The British exchange rose by 18125, equivalent to three offices and 15625, and the US exchange rose by half a yuan, equivalent to five yuan 3125. There was no market for French, German, and Japanese currencies, and the remaining exchanges also rose in unison, causing the dark market for Anglo-American exchanges to also show a surprising loosening trend. Speculative bulls were stunned and found it difficult to find opponents for selling. The US dollar went from four yuan seventy-five and hardened to five yuan eighteen seventy-five, and the British gold went to three offices and zero six twenty-five (both non-official market prices). Legitimate importers were able to settle the US dollar at five yuan thirty-one twenty-five, which is an increase of eighteen notches, and both British and American banks provided it. However, the black market settlement was only five yuan, and it was difficult to obtain British gold at three offices. In the afternoon, speculators still had no inflow or outflow, and foreign firms' settlement was also minimal. Ultimately, the two factions had a huge squeeze and the transaction was not strong.</p>
<p>Bulls Were Stunned</p>
<p>Since the morning, there was no market for British and American silver in foreign telegrams, the spot price of Indian silver was flat, the futures price fell, and the exchange rate of Yinghua against Shanghai in various countries narrowed by 03125, the US dollar against Shanghai narrowed by three points, and the rest were flat. The central listing price of each exchange remained the same. The opening price of the interbank market in the early morning was the selling price of spot British gold at two offices and eight four three seven five, and the US dollar at four yuan seventy-five, which was flat for the British and tight for the US by zero three one two five compared to Saturday's afternoon closing. After the opening, speculators once again bought in according to the previous uptrend, and importing firms also purchased for settlement. Before the 9:30 a.m. HSBC listing, there was an unexpected and sudden increase, and small counters also increased the US exchange to five yuan thirty-one twenty-five, a bolt from the blue, starting a cheap sale. At the same time, HSBC and American banks moderately supplied the US exchange at five yuan thirty-one twenty-five for legitimate commercial settlements. Speculators and new bulls were stunned. The loosest black market price was British gold at three offices and zero six twenty-five, and the US dollar rose to five yuan eighteen seventy-five, but both were quoted prices in the chaos. At noon closing, British gold was two offices and nine six eight seven five, and the US exchange was lacking momentum and could be settled at five yuan. The buying price of banks must be five yuan thirty-one twenty-five.</p>
<p>Importers' Willingness to Negotiate</p>
<p>In the afternoon, speculators still had no supply or demand, and importers' willingness to settle was also weak. HSBC still supplied and sold the US exchange at five yuan thirty-one twenty-five to legitimate commercial foreign firms. Youli McGarrett Datong had a worse intention to supply. At the 3:30 p.m. closing, the spot price to the September futures price was British exchange at three offices and zero one five six two five, and the US dollar at five yuan zero three one two five, which was up one seven one eight seven five for the British and fifteen for the US compared to Saturday's noon closing.</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Gold Market Suffers an Unprecedented Change: Bills Dramatically Loosen...Bulls Suffer a Huge Blow: There is Supply but No Demand...Futures Fall More Severely than Spot Prices <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the volatile dark market for gold, a huge change occurred suddenly in the futures gold market, with a sharp and tragic drop in price. Prices have fallen below the 7,000 yuan mark, and all parties are unusually frightened. The HSBC listing of foreign exchange suddenly jumped, and the black market followed suit, greatly easing. The bulls were panic-stricken. In the chaotic situation of abundant supply and no demand at Cheng Ji, Yi Da, Xinfeng Yong, Heng Ji, and Xiang Xing Yong, the price plummeted from 7,265 yuan to a low of 6,750 yuan. After 10:30 a.m., it was heard that the black market US exchange was settling at only five yuan, and the Shanghai West gang took advantage of the low price to make up for the losses, and the price recovered by 150 yuan. However, people's hearts were already panicked, and the price was difficult to sustain for a long time. In the afternoon, gold dealers sold bills of exchange to offset the US dollar bulls, pushing the price down to around 6,800 yuan. Ultimately, there was a sharp drop of 453 yuan. It is said that since the release of the foreign exchange freeze order, the long and short sides of the gold market have been fiercely contested. After a certain giant bull suffered an unexpected blow last Saturday, yesterday's father had to release a huge amount of bull chips due to the easing of foreign exchange. The shorts can finally take a breather, and it is said that they have leveled a lot yesterday. The total transaction was more than 100,000 taels. Because the gold price has been raised by more than 200 yuan according to the HSBC small counter US exchange, the swap (August to September) was posted by the bulls Yi Da Xiang He to the shorts Tong Kang Yong for 100 yuan to 120 yuan, with more than 1,000 taels traded. The cash price also fell sharply. Xin Yuan sold 120 taels to Xiang He at a price of 8,920 yuan, which retreated to 8,850 yuan at noon and 8,800 yuan in the afternoon. There was a supply but no demand, with a small squeeze of 190 yuan. The price of gold jewelry was also 10 yuan lower, calculated at 910 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Fall 453 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each tael (10 taels) opened at 7,260 yuan at 9:15 a.m., which was 12 yuan higher than the closing price on Saturday afternoon. Next, it saw 7,265 yuan. When the amount of gold pouring from Jin Hao Cheng Ji was huge, the market price was suppressed. When the HSBC listing of foreign exchange was suddenly eased and the black market also eased dramatically, buyers in the market disappeared. In the astonishing selling trend of Xiang Xing Yong, Heng Ji, Xinfeng Yong, Dingsheng, Meifeng, Yi Da, and Xiang He, the market price fell sharply. In the sparse transaction volume, the price fell by a total of 465 yuan, retreating to the 6,800 yuan mark. Sometimes Xiang Xing Yong entered again, and Tian Yuan and Li Tai also bought, and the market situation was raised to 7,008 yuan in chaos. Later, it was heard that commercial import foreign firms had settled at 5 yuan 3125 for the US dollar, and the selling trend rose again. In the selling trend of Heng Ji, Tian Yuan, Cheng Ji, He Sheng and various households, it fell by more than 250 yuan again, dropping to 6,750 yuan. This was strongly bought by Xinfeng Yong, Yi Feng, and Yi Yuan. Scattered shorts took profits to cover their positions, and they immediately hoarded up to 6,900 yuan. Defu, Tian Yuan, Yong An, and others sold a small amount of 100 yuan again, to 6,800 yuan. At noon closing, 6,840 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 p.m. and fell by 40 yuan in the selling trend, calculated at 6,800 yuan. Later, it fell to 6,780 yuan again. Xiang Xing Yong, Yi Yuan, and Xin Feng Yong entered vigorously, and the price suddenly soared by 80 yuan, reaching 6,860 yuan. It was heard that banks were supplying and selling the US dollar at 5 yuan 03125, and Cheng Ji sold more than 10,000 taels, and Yi Da, Da Feng, and Gong He sold vigorously, and the price gradually fell by 100 yuan, retreating to 6,760 yuan. This was strongly bought by Xiang He, and it immediately saw a rise to 6,830 yuan, and then fell again. At the 3:30 p.m. closing, the price was 6,795 yuan, a sharp drop of 453 yuan compared to the noon closing price on Saturday. According to the September US dollar settlement price of 5 yuan 03125, the 6,921 yuan was calculated to be pressed by 126 yuan. According to the small counter US exchange settlement price, it has created a 240 yuan premium. After the closing, 6,800 yuan, there was a difference of 515 yuan on the same day. Jin Hao's own brand gold, the retail price at the store was 8,850 yuan, with a 200 yuan deduction for purchases. There was no price and no market for the current standard gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold and Silver Show Different Trends</p>

<p>The ups and downs of the gauze market are like a wild storm, with a difference of nearly a hundred yuan between rises and falls. Today, the exchange officially opened, and the business market was moved to the second floor. The opening was enthusiastically promoted, pushing it upwards, reaching a new peak of 1,700 yuan, specifically 1,708 yuan. At this time, speculators took profits cautiously, but as the saying goes, things will revert after reaching their extreme. After the foreign exchange rate narrowed, it suddenly surged. It was reported that HSBC's quotation reached 5.3125 yuan, and in an instant, the price of gold plummeted by three hundred yuan. Speculators suffered a great blow, like a bolt from the blue. In an instant, they switched from buying to selling. Unexpectedly, the market was hit by this setback and gradually fell to a low price of 1,625 yuan. Subsequently, there were rumors in the market, saying that although HSBC's quotation was firm, the settlement price was still low. For a time, the market was still chaotic. As for a group of short sellers, they took advantage of the wind to make a quick buck. The situation rebounded to 1,675 yuan. The closing price was 1,670 yuan. Currently, the gauze market is deeply afraid of remaining volatile, because people's minds are in chaos. However, if the foreign exchange rate can be quoted above five yuan, prices can be stabilized, and those who hoard goods will also lack enthusiasm. The transaction volume for half a day was 8,605 bales. There was no market in the afternoon. Yesterday, 1,650 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each trading group is listed as follows: Hong Kong 305, peers 8,500, total 8,805.</p>
<p>The futures market situation of Gold Double Horses turned from firm and rising to sharply falling, with extremely violent reactions. At the opening in the morning, the sentiment was mostly excited due to the slight increase in American cotton. Bull positions followed the surge of factory orders, absorbing the momentum after the weekend. The market price continued to rise. The August contract opened at 1,515 yuan, a sudden increase of 12 yuan. Afterwards, the gold market suddenly plummeted by more than 400 yuan due to the rise in foreign exchange. HSBC's commercial exchange rate was quoted at 5.3125 yuan. Therefore, people were uneasy and panicked. Factory orders fell sharply, as much as 70 or 80 yuan. Long positions in futures gauze fluctuated, and a large number of positions were liquidated, resulting in a rapid decline of 50 or 60 yuan in an instant. The September contract opened at 1,590 yuan, and the October contract at 1,605 yuan. Afterwards, the August contract fell to a low of 1,460 yuan, the September contract fell to 1,552 yuan, and the October contract fell to 1,580 yuan. The difference between the high and low prices reached more than 20 yuan to 50 or 60 yuan. Subsequently, short positions were covered at lower prices, and the market rebounded. The morning close for the August contract was 1,485 yuan, the September contract was 1,579 yuan, and the October contract was 1,580 yuan. The transaction volume in the morning was 15,600 yuan. There was no market for factory orders in the afternoon, and trading seemed relatively blind. In addition, the gold market fluctuated, and people's minds were initially difficult to grasp. Afterwards, the trend reversed, suddenly rising in the midst of the softening gold market. The August contract rose to a high of 1,489 yuan, the September contract rose to 1,582 yuan, and the October contract rose to 1,600 yuan. The foundation was solid, and long positions remained firm. As a result, the August contract was 1,489 yuan, closing down 14 yuan. The September contract was 1,576 yuan, down 13 yuan. The October contract was 1,599 yuan, closing down 8 yuan. The closing prices for near and distant months differed by a huge sum of 110 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 22,030 bales, an increase of 9,340 bales compared to the previous day. Considering the huge plunge in the gold market, the foundation of the gauze market can be said to be extremely solid. However, if the exchange rate continues to rise, those engaged in the industry should be cautious about being hit and moving downstream. The daily price table is listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e72">Sudden Increase in US Exchange Rate; Futures for Cotton Increase Sharply; Over 4,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton Arrive <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Orders: Due to enthusiastic buying by the public, the spot market for foreign cotton in Shanghai is thriving. At the same time, due to the sudden drop in the price of gold at the opening yesterday morning and the sudden increase in the US exchange rate, factories and cotton dealers took the opportunity to buy US exchange and vigorously purchase foreign cotton. This is because obtaining a longer-term foreign exchange rate enables them to purchase spot goods that will arrive in Shanghai in the near future, which is more profitable than purchasing spot goods in the local market. Therefore, in addition to a small number of spot transactions of American cotton and Brazilian cotton in recent days, the total amount of Brazilian cotton futures sold by various foreign cotton trading firms has reached about 2,000 bales. Moreover, if its selling price is compared with the spot price of Shanghai cotton, the difference is nearly 70 or 80 yuan, which is undoubtedly a good opportunity for all parties to actively place orders.</p>
<p>Arrivals: A large batch of Indian cotton was transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan vessel arrived at the port the day before yesterday (the 17th). In addition to transporting foreign rice, it also carried 2,134 pieces of cotton. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,104 pieces of cotton from Hong Kong. The cotton carried by the two vessels is all produced in India. It is reported that a certain Japanese merchant in the city purchased it. It was originally intended to be transported by Japanese vessels, but due to the suspension of Japanese vessels to India, it was transported to Hong Kong by British vessels and then transshipped to Shanghai. In the future, it is feared that this cotton will arrive from time to time.</p>
<p>Spot Goods: The spot cotton situation is very firm. Although the foreign exchange rate has surged and the gauze market is chaotic, and speculators have been greatly hit, prices are still not constrained by changes in other prices due to enthusiastic current demand. The opening quotes are recorded again as follows: Middling 714, Yufeng 200 pieces sent to the factory; Middling 717, Yufeng 100 pieces sent to the factory; Middling 720, Yufeng 200 pieces sent to the factory; Middling 688, House Brand 100 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Middling 710, House Brand 100 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Middling 690, House Brand 100 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Brazilian Cotton 610, House Brand 123 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Brazilian Cotton 683, House Brand 200 pieces delivered ex-warehouse; Brazilian Cotton 690, House Brand 160 pieces delivered ex-warehouse.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Food: Entirely Reliant on the Rise of Foreign Exchange to Allow People's Food Supply to Have a Breather; Fortunately, There are 50,000 Bags of Newly Ordered and Arriving Rice, Otherwise, It Would Suffer from an Endless Surge of Eight Yuan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>After the holiday yesterday, foreign rice sellers generally cited the rise in the previous week, and their sentiments remained firm. At the opening of the morning market, they all held goods and tried hard to raise prices, thinking that the Public Works Department's rice had suddenly increased by eight yuan. Scattered retail sellers, etc., were quite active. The Small Grain Bank Warehouse once again opened at 127 yuan, and the Foreign Warehouse at 126 yuan. Just as they were excited, the foreign exchange rate suddenly surged, and all foreign rice orders were approved. As a result, new transactions involved 2,500 tons of small grain, including 1,000 tons of small grain (some say it was Min Dang) thrown out by Shen Ji, priced at 152 yuan, and 1,500 tons of small grain loaded in early August and early September, priced at 151 yuan. Other foreign firms and Chinese merchants also had multiple negotiations underway. The atmosphere in the market suddenly changed. Long speculators were timid and sought to sell, and retailers turned from buying to selling. The market price repeatedly fell in the heavy selling atmosphere. For example, Small Grain East Warehouse was as high as 126.5 yuan in the early morning market, but closed as low as 124 yuan. Yinghua Company's Small Grain initially opened at 154 yuan, then successively fell from 153.5 yuan, 3 yuan, 2.5 yuan, and 2 yuan to as low as 151.5 yuan. Second-grade rice fell from 147 yuan to as low as 146 yuan and was still subject to buyers. Other types of rice all rose first and then fell, and the final closing prices were all 1.5 yuan to 2 yuan lower than last Saturday. The total market turnover of spot rice was 7,000 bags, Yinghua Company 560 tons.</p>
<p>Foreign rice arriving at the port yesterday: The Zhishali ship of the Java Company arrived in Shanghai on Saturday evening last week, carrying 10,000 bags of foreign rice from Java, berthing at the Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading; The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan ship arrived at the port at noon on the 17th, carrying 3,039 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at Pudong, and will be moved to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession within days; The Ganzhou ship arrived at the port yesterday morning, also carrying 5,290 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at Pudong when entering the port, and will be moved to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession within days; Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 6,480 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the Rochefort Wharf for unloading. The above four ships carried a total of more than 24,800 bags of foreign rice, all of which were passenger and cargo ships. (Zu)</p>
<p>Due to the accumulation of arrivals, thick and thin japonica rice markets also became fatigued, and local stores were all sluggish, so the market prices were difficult to support and fell. Early indica rice from South Harbor opened at 154 yuan, then 152.5 yuan; Wuxi Special Japonica at 155 yuan, Zhongguan at 147 yuan, and Sujia at 144.2 yuan. Newly harvested japonica rice was difficult to stand firm and depreciated by one or two yuan. Fourteen loads were sold, priced at 158 yuan and 156 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, glutinous rice had a good appetite at local shops and food stalls, so the sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, and the price alone remained strong. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 130 yuan, then fell to 126 yuan; Special glutinous tea opened at 118 yuan, then fell to 115 yuan; Broken glutinous rice at 103 yuan; National glutinous rice at 130 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Relentless Rise in Oil Beans Causes Hardship for General Living <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The price of soybeans continued to rise. Yesterday, sellers still used the excuse of a shortage of sources to hoard goods and push up prices, and the market was moving towards a new peak. It is estimated that 300 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans were sold, priced at 63 yuan; 200 bags of Qingkou soybeans were priced at 62.5 yuan; 600 bags of Guide soybeans were priced at 59.2 to 61 yuan, a sharp increase of two or three yuan compared to the previous day. Yesterday, 240 bags of soybeans and 1,240 pieces of bean cakes were shipped to Hong Kong. Tofu shops and dried tofu curd sheets are at least five cents, causing great hardship for general living.</p>
<p>The prices of edible oils rose and fell. Raw soybean oil was still selling well due to a shortage of goods. It was reported that the off-market price of Qingdao raw soybean oil had reached 310 yuan, and Dayou factory soybean oil was at 226 yuan. However, the prices of vegetable oil and cottonseed oil were affected by the loosening of gold exchange rates, and the thoughts of scattered hoarding were quite shaken, resulting in prices being lowered by 5, 6, or 7 yuan. A total of 700 dan of Qingyou oil from Dayou Factory were sold, as well as 100 dan of vegetable oil, more than 2,000 dan of vegetable oil from Rihua Factory, 100 dan of vegetable oil from Lide Factory, and 50 barrels each of vegetable oil from Yoshida and Taishan Factories. Although the door-to-door sales price of raw soybean oil on the market is still 2.16 yuan per catty, the quality of the oil is quite uneven, and the profit margins are very high. Generally, the more expensive the price, the more you spend, and the worse the quality of the materials you get.</p>

<p>Over-the-counter trading of government bonds was increasingly deserted yesterday. Therefore, multiple parties boldly raised prices, because there were very few opponents and the opportunity was excellent. Even multiple parties were making prices for each other. For example, the quoted high price for Class C yesterday was 7.8 yuan, which was not a formal market price. Therefore, after 8.8 yuan, it immediately fell to 6.5 yuan. The authenticity of the market price was immediately apparent. Yesterday, due to the manipulation of gold prices, there was a sudden drop of 500 yuan, which caused speculation in the government bond market and slightly improved the situation. Although the market price rebounded by three to five cents, Lianyi Dingkang bought in, and Runli Hongda Renfeng Tongkang sold out in the morning. The closing price in the afternoon was slightly better by about three cents. In the afternoon, Hongda covered, Yichang Shengchang bought in, and Runli continued to sell. Xinhua Yongkang sold out 90% of their holdings. Class C once saw a high price of 7.8 yuan, but immediately fell. As a result, except for Class D, which did not open, all other classes rebounded by 1.5 to 5.5 cents. The transaction volume was only 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>In stock trading, 200 shares of China Merchants Electric Company were traded at a price of 9.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Ye Guang Real Estate stock market opened strong and then softened, but the underlying trend was still good. The volume of Ye Guang Real Estate stock was extremely high, reaching as high as 21.75 yuan, and closed at 21 yuan.</p>

<p>With the freezing of Japanese funds by Britain and the United States, raw silk was also included. Although it has not been fully implemented, Japan has adopted the same policy. Two weeks ago, it was rumored in Shanghai that an order had come from Tokyo, prohibiting the export of raw silk from Central China and stopping the supply to the United States. At that time, the Japanese silk industry, after receiving this news, was worried that a large number of stored silk would have no way to sell, and the market price would inevitably fall. Therefore, they urgently sold a large amount of raw silk to third-country export companies. As a result, silk companies such as Jardine Matheson Dachang, which had been depressed for a long time, have seen unprecedented prosperity in transactions in the past half month. This month, various third-country exporters in Shanghai will ship a total of five or six thousand bales of raw silk to the United States on the Coolidge vessel.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: The market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon. Colored goods and fine yarn goods have been sharply raised in price because silk factories are limited by electricity, the output has decreased, spot goods are in short supply, and it is easy for speculators to take advantage. Therefore, cloth prices rebounded rapidly. As a result, white goods, coarse and fine cloth, twill flannelette, and part of the cloth increased by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Colored cloth, bleached cloth, line wool, and poplin increased by 5 cents to 1.5 yuan. The Nanyang gang had the strongest demand, with transactions of more than 500 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, colored cloth, group cloth, khaki, etc. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs transacted more than 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, etc. The wholesale transactions in the local market were low. Dyeing factories bought more than 500 pieces of gray cloth, etc. On the 18th, a total of 150 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Indian bituminous coal has recently become a scarce commodity due to the lack of old orders in the market, which has attracted attention from insiders. A small number of transactions were made by a certain household a few days ago, with prices as high as 550 yuan, asking for sky-high prices without any standard. Yesterday, since the sharp fall in the foreign exchange market, people's sentiments have become equal. A large number of hoarders liquidated, and the market price suddenly dropped. It was reported that a certain firm opened with a bid of only 500 yuan, and some transactions were also made. In short, in the recent coal market, insiders have stopped selling, and the market is manipulated by hoarders, with huge fluctuations.</p>

<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>In this era of suffering, lack of clothing and food is a common occurrence. Clothing and food are the foundation of life, so they are naturally important. However, among the fortunate ones who have adequate clothing and food, we can find some regrettable phenomena.</p>
<p>"My dad is a typical stern father, constantly thinking about economics all day long, as if he wants to swallow the newspaper every day. The children haven't seen a smile on his face for ten years. He doesn't seem to know that exquisite clothing and food cannot satisfy the inner needs of the children. I would rather not ride in a car or live in a foreign-style building, but for Dad to be able to talk and laugh with us. I hope he is a rickshaw puller, not a banker. There seems to be a layer of separation between me and him. I can't get close to him, and he can't understand me." This is from a letter from a fifteen or sixteen-year-old girl, the inner pain of an unfortunate fortunate one.</p>
<p>Humans certainly rely on material things and money to maintain life, but life is by no means something that can be solved solely by material things and money. In addition to material enjoyment, we also need spiritual love and understanding.</p>
<p>Whether life is happy or not depends on whether the way of life is reasonable. A person who is overly focused on material enjoyment often does not know how to achieve a reasonable life. They do not know that beyond adequate clothing and food, there are other needs.</p>
<p>Please think about it, what else do your children need besides clothing and food?</p>

<h3 id="e81">The Demise of Little Mussolini <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The black-shirted Prime Minister Mussolini, who was a hero of his time, can be said to have had "multiple misfortunes" this year. Not only have his troops suffered repeated defeats in East Africa and Greece, but his position in the country also relies entirely on German secret agents to support him. His daughter, the wife of Foreign Minister Ciano, once fell into the water and nearly drowned. Not many days ago, his second son, Bruno, was reported to have died in a plane crash.</p>
<p>Among Mussolini's sons, the two eldest, Soluno and Vittorio, have both joined the air force and serve as junior officers. Bruno, who was about twenty-four years old, had already obtained a pilot's license at the age of seventeen. When the Abyssinian War broke out, he was only eighteen years old and served as an air force combatant. Later, he joined the Italian Volunteer Corps and went to Spain to help the Nationalist Army fight. When the Italian army attacked Greece, Bruno and his brother Vittorio flew bombers to bomb Athens and other places.</p>
<p>In his private capacity, Bruno served as the manager of the Latin American Airlines. The airline operated a very long route, from Rome to Rio de Janeiro, the capital of Brazil, and from there to the capitals of Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p>Bruno's flying record reached about two thousand hours. He had extensive experience in flying civil and military aircraft. He claimed that he liked aerial combat the most, his reason being: "Because aerial combat inspires people, increases the tension of life, and also makes people have a more practical feeling about life. A novice civilian pilot can never imagine the many techniques he needs to learn in aerial combat. Only after encountering enemy aircraft, passing through enemy fire, or witnessing anti-aircraft shells exploding around him, can he truly understand the conditions necessary for a true aerial warrior. War makes him a pilot and a hero. So this is a way to make a name for oneself."</p>
<p>Mussolini's sons were all strong, active, thrifty, and hardworking. Bruno was especially impressive. He did not put on the airs of the Prime Minister's son in the army. The people in his team called him by his first name and joked with him. But he was not without a sense of majesty. He often twirled his short, unkempt mustache to show his inviolability, but this only added to the laughter of others.</p>
<p>As for whether Bruno was a war fanatic who wanted to become a bloodthirsty demon? Not so. He told people that he hoped the war would end sooner so that he could work hard to develop his civilian airline.</p>
<p>This time, he was test-flying a new long-range bomber near Pisa when he crashed while attempting a safe landing, which can be said to be an unexpected disaster.</p>
<p>Hitler, upon hearing of his ally Mussolini's grief over the loss of his son, immediately sent a telegram to comfort him. In fact, in this European war led by Germany, Little Mussolini can be said to have died an unjust death.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Are Old People Forgetful? <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>We probably all agree that older people are forgetful compared to young people. According to psychology experts, a person's memory slowly begins to decline when they reach nearly forty years old. From this time on, learning new things seems much more difficult. But memorizing poems and remembering numbers are not affected. Therefore, the so-called decline in memory cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>Recently, a psychology expert used eleven different methods to test the strength of memory, including memorizing sentences, remembering three-digit numbers, paragraph recitation, silent writing, silent drawing, and other tests. Paragraph recitation is certainly more difficult than remembering numbers and silent writing. As for silent drawing, it requires not only good memory but also drawing ability.</p>
<p>Memory is often only one-sided. For example, many people can only remember different faces and cannot remember their names. Everyone's memory is also not the same. Generally, smart people's memory declines slightly slower than that of foolish people.</p>
<p>The expert mentioned above said that older people cannot integrate well with new things, resulting in forgetfulness.</p>
<p>To remedy the shortcoming of forgetfulness, psychologists have come up with many methods for us. They tell us to record important things in a memo book at any time and place so that we can browse them at will in our spare time and avoid forgetting. Secondly, do not rely solely on young people because you are old. We know that the more you rely on others, the greater the forgetfulness. If we want to remember, then we should memorize it ourselves; those elderly people who are sensitive and able to adapt to new environments must have a relatively strong memory.</p>
<p>Finally, reading can also help us remember. Many people say before they are old, "It's useless, now is not the time to read!" In fact, they are all wrong. Reading will exercise our thinking ability and thus enhance memory.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Selling Cartilage <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>Normally, we only hear about blood donation societies, but now there are companies that sell cartilage. But, does this represent the progress of modern science, or is it an irony of this society where money is omnipotent?</p>
<p>If a person's nose is accidentally broken, he can consult a plastic surgeon. The doctor can find a way to take a small piece of cartilage from his ribs and graft it onto his nose. However, this requires two surgeries.</p>
<p>But if the patient has money, he can buy a piece of someone else's cartilage. Currently, there are more than a hundred men and women registered with a certain company in New York to sell cartilage. The cost is approximately one hundred to five hundred US dollars.</p>
<p>There are five places in the human body where cartilage can be extracted: the nose, both ears, and both sides of the ribs. The ribs usually removed are about half an inch wide and a quarter of an inch long. The highest record is half an inch wide and two inches long.</p>
<p>When transplanting cartilage from another person, two plastic surgeons are also needed. One performs surgery on the "seller," and the other performs surgery on the "buyer."</p>

<p>11 The Serenade at Midnight</p>
<p>Suddenly, she saw that there was a huqin hanging below the frame on the wall.</p>
<p>"Mom, don't be angry, I've already learned how to sing opera!" She said, leaning on her mother's knees, "As long as I can become famous in the future, you and Dad will be able to eat well for the rest of your lives!"</p>
<p>"Sing opera? Can you even sing opera?" Mom asked with a doubtful expression.</p>
<p>At this moment, her teacher Shang Laoer had already walked in very amusingly. Even Mei Bao didn't know where he came from. Shang Laoer's face, as usual, was piled with a very special smile. He seemed to know Mei Bao's mother too. As soon as he came in, he greeted her and then immediately took down the huqin from the wall and played a passage of Erhuang music.</p>
<p>"Mom, don't you believe me? I'll sing a section for you right away!" Mei Bao said excitedly.</p>
<p>She didn't say anything, just smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>"I... here, brother, lazily open my eyes..." Mei Bao then used all her strength to sing loudly on the pit. "Shake, shake, twist and move forward... I have to..."</p>
<p>Before she could sing three or four sentences, she startled the begonia on the opposite couch.</p>
<p>When he first woke up, he didn't know that the opera singer was in the room. He thought that Yu was drunk and yelling outside. Later, when he calmed down, he realized that the opera singer was actually Mei Bao.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Mei Bao!" He yelled and jumped off the pit.</p>
<p>"...Red Luo tent, inverted phoenix head..." Mei Bao didn't wake up and was still singing on. (188)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Cloud Observation Machine <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>Dr. Niu Bojie, a professor at the Provincial University of Pan Province in the United States, has recently invented a cloud observation machine that can predict the shape and changes of clouds in the sky within two to four hours on a clear day. Dr. Niu discovered that whenever there is a sudden increase in the concentration of microparticles in the air, clouds are bound to appear in the sky within four hours. These so-called concentration microparticles are coal smoke and dust in the air, which usually maintain a balance with the temperature in the air. However, if the temperature suddenly increases, this equilibrium will be disrupted, and the humidity in the microparticles will increase rapidly, creating water droplets. These water droplets then gather to form clouds. Although this type of observation machine can only be used when there are no clouds in the sky, it is indeed a great contribution to meteorology.</p>

<h3 id="e87">On Chen Hongsheng’s “Playing Repertoire” <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Yun</p>
<p>Tianchan has hired Mr. Chen Hongsheng and his sister to come south, which is considered appropriate by commentators. I have previously written an article in this publication to introduce them. Now, the repertoire of "playing repertoire" that the Chen siblings will perform has been announced, and those in Shanghai who are confused about Chen's school of performance should be able to find an answer. Chen Hongsheng initially studied under Xiao Hongsheng, mastering all the strengths of the Liu school. Before long, his voice gave out, and he gradually drew from the styles of Tan, Yu, and even Ma. The other night, I and others discussed the "playing repertoire" with Chen. Chen cited what he could do, each drawing on the strengths of various schools, no longer restricting his free style with the style of a single school. Chen’s three-day “playing repertoire” was originally intended to draw from Tan, Liu, and Ma, each exhausting the strengths of one school each day, but Mr. Chen feared that this would confuse the audience, as if they were lost. Therefore, based on the current environment, three plays were chosen. The first night will be the complete "Qin Huan's Exile and Night Attack on Dengzhou," with Hongsheng playing the complete role of Qin Huan, wearing black third-class official attire and a cyan arrow jacket, displaying an air of heroic spirit amidst elegance. Today's performing old male roles often prefer "Questioning the Woodcutter and Ruckus at the Mansion," but in fact, "Night Attack on Dengzhou" has frequent movements, which is quite different from "Hong Men Banquet". "Questioning the Woodcutter" has little singing, while in "Night Attack on Dengzhou", starting from Sanjiadian, several sections of flowing water melodies require strict rhythm and full expression. Without a good voice, it is not easy to please the audience. The second day will be "Su Wu Herding Sheep." Many who study Ma's style can perform this, but this play is not Ma's creation; it was Ma who promoted and glorified it. Lao Lu's "Su Wu Herding Sheep" has a completely different appearance from that of Lian Liang. Chen aims to emulate Wen Ru in his acting, seeking expressiveness in his singing, and incorporating his own strengths, making it another masterpiece. The third night will be the complete "White Python Terrace," starting from taking Luoyang and ending at the White Python Terrace in Yuntai Temple. Taking Luoyang will be performed by Tang Songqiao as Ma Wu, while Xue Qiao will play Cen Peng, Yang Bao will play Deng Yu, and Chen Ling will play the complete role of Wang Mang. It is well known that this play requires extraordinary singing skills. Prefacing it with "Taking Luoyang" makes it even more brilliant. It is said that the date of Chen's performance has been set for the twentieth of this month, and a grand occasion is expected at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e88">After Seeing “Grape Wine” <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Feng</p>
<p>“Grape Wine” was originally named "Luminous Cup." After the war, it was very popular in various parts of the mainland. It was banned in Shanghai for a period and not allowed to be performed. Not long ago, the Tianfeng Drama Society rehearsed it for several weeks, renaming it "Gratitude and Revenge," starring Murong Wan'er, and received considerable praise. Now, China Travel has renamed it "Grape Wine" again and added a first act to the original four acts, making it a total of five acts. The dialogue and plot in the middle have also been slightly changed, but the general plot and theme remain the same.</p>
<p>The story takes place a little over ten years ago, during the era of warlord rule. A dancer, Chen Fengyun, was entrusted by revolutionaries to assassinate the wicked warlord Huang Boren in Hankou, due to both personal vendettas and public outrage. Huang was originally a patron who pursued her, so it was easy to approach him, but because of the tight security, she struggled to find a way to strike. She had to seduce Huang's trusted adjutant, Yu Zhong, explain the greater good, and persuade him to assassinate Boren together. Yu Zhong was an upright young man who immediately realized Huang's wickedness and his own responsibility, and he made up his mind to eliminate the scourge. Unexpectedly, Yu's mother found out about this. She was originally Huang's wet nurse, and due to a kind of ignorant feeling and to save Yu Zhong's life, she told Huang about it. Huang immediately arrested the two, first executing Yu Zhong and then forcing Fengyun to confess. Fengyun knew that her lover had also been killed, and in deep hatred, she decided to sacrifice herself to get revenge. She managed to put poison in the grape wine and die with Huang.</p>
<p>The main point of this play is not to expose the sins of the warlords, but to awaken those who act as lackeys for evil demons, and to condemn their ignorance. Yu Zhong was originally an upright and promising young man, but because he lacked clear understanding, he became a henchman for a warlord and forgot his responsibility to the country and nation. Later, he realized his mistake, and although his plan failed and he died, his death was glorious, far better than his previous foolish loyalty to Huang. Also, Yu's mother's ignorance was the biggest factor in causing the tragedy. She was unaware of the consequences, blindly ignorant, only concerned with the favors the master gave them. In order to save her son's life and position, she ruined the important matter and cost her son's life. People with such a dim awareness do not deserve sympathy and should be eliminated.</p>

<p>(3) Storms Arise from Huang Guiqiu's Apprenticeship (Part 1)</p>
<p>In the northern opera world, in addition to the Four Famous Dan performers, there are also the Four Unlucky Dan performers. The so-called Four Unlucky Dan performers refer to Xu Biyun, Zhu Qinxin, Huang Guiqiu, and Wang Youqing. Because these four female roles all possess superb artistry but have always been extremely unlucky, they are called the Four Unlucky Dan performers. Speaking of the Four Unlucky Dan performers, Xu, Zhu, and Wang have long been silent, only Huang Guiqiu is still struggling with the environment, continuing his stage life. Although Guiqiu does not perform often in the north now, he is striving to make progress in his art. Recently, he has the motivation to study under Wang Yaoqing to seek further advancement. Because he knows that if he can get Yaoqing's guidance, he will definitely be able to get unlimited help in the field of art. Therefore, a month ago, he entrusted his friend Zhang Xiaoshan (one of the earliest famous amateur performers in the former capital who studied Wang Yaoqing and had a deep friendship with Yaoqing, also a disciple of Wang) to seek Yaoqing's consent. Unexpectedly, this Master of All Trades who specializes in accepting disciples expressed absolute refusal to accept Huang Guiqiu, introduced by Zhang Xiaoshan, and even launched into a fit of complaining. Why did Yaoqing complain? This is a long story.</p>
<p>It turns out that twenty years ago, Huang Guiqiu once wanted to study under Wang Yaoqing. At that time, Yaoqing readily agreed and even set a date to hold the apprenticeship ceremony. Unexpectedly, at this time, someone suggested to Huang Guiqiu that it would be better to study under Chen Delin than under Wang Yaoqing, because Yaoqing was Delin's disciple. Studying under Delin would allow him to be called teacher-brothers with Yaoqing, which seemed to increase his status invisibly. Huang Guiqiu was greatly moved upon hearing this, and so, in the very short process that Wang Yaoqing had prepared to accept Huang Guiqiu as a disciple, this Mr. Huang went back on his word and joined the ranks of Chen "Stone" Delin's disciples. Naturally, Wang Yaoqing was very dissatisfied with Huang Guiqiu at the time, but because the other party was his teacher, he had to swallow his anger, but this breath has remained in his stomach ever since.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Round Round, Little Words, Delicate Silk</p>
<p>So she said to him, "I'm afraid this humble servant doesn't have such fortune. I imagine there must be many beautiful women in the residence. How can my willow-like appearance be worthy of being among them?" Tian Hongyu smiled again and said, "Oh, don't be so modest. Although my home has many beauties, how can they compare to you? If you don't believe me, come with me to my house and you will naturally know. I will call you the most beautiful woman in the world." Round Round heard him getting closer with his words, and dared not say anything more. She went to fetch a small knife and peeled a pair of snow pears for him to eat. Unexpectedly, at this time, the flower butterfly came again. The more Round Round didn't welcome him, the more he wanted to come. Round Round secretly cursed him. Tian Hongyu said to him with a smile, "Why are you so late?" The flower butterfly said, "This young one has been here for some time." As he spoke, he whispered a few words into Tian Hongyu's ear. Tian Hongyu nodded and said, "Very good, very good, I understand." Tian Hongyu understood, but Round Round understood even less. She didn't know what the flower butterfly was up to, but she guessed that he must be plotting something in front of her, so she had to be wary. She hated the flower butterfly even more, only hoping that tomorrow night would come quickly so she could fly away with the jade-cherishing poet, and then she could escape this predicament. When the flower butterfly saw Round Round, he still chatted with her as "Miss" this and "Miss" that. Round Round thought that one could only treat such people like a Buddha and guard against them like a thief, so she had to put on a slight false face. Tian Hongyu sat in Round Round's dressing room, happy and reluctant to leave, as if he had entered Mount Tian Tai with Liu Lang. In the evening, he set up a banquet upstairs, ordering Round Round to pour wine and sing songs. Other guests who came were politely rejected by the foster mother. Everyone heard that the Father-in-law of the Nation was here, so they had to retreat three times. Round Round was afraid that Tian Hongyu would come again tomorrow night, and she and the poet would not be able to leave, so she deliberately invited Tian Hongyu to come again for a happy drink the day after tomorrow. She also said that she would go to Qionglong Mountain to burn incense tomorrow afternoon, and she might not be able to return, and she might have to spend the night on the mountain. (145)</p>
