<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海市塲之憧憬</h3>
<p>四底方過，絲茶上市，端節將臨，本是金融業最繁榮活躍的時候，而今則不然，但看一種閑散情形，不言可喻；利率低降，現錢與匯割的貼現，已在五角一元之間；甚至於別出花樣，現鈔與劃頭，在平時本係一物者，近來居然劃頭要申水，即數千款項，一二元的申水出入，亦劃分得淸淸楚楚，這不是合理舉動，正以見畸形的上海市塲，現鈔多，游資充；金融業最會打算，刻劃入微，遂有此畸形現狀。</p>
<p>另一方面，自從美議院委員會通過授權總統有續貶美元値的議決案，上海市塲曾有一度的衝動，畢竟是平靜下去。美元之値續貶的可能性，不自今日始，時局怎樣地演變下去，則爲適應時勢所需要，不要說美元之値再貶，即任何其他必要的措施也會應運而生。大衆對此，殊不必驚奇，此種行動，尙不失含有建設性在內，並小是完全爲戰時一種破壞性質。只要認淸未夾的趨勢，ABC三國始終合作，經濟上休戚相關，自成一圜，行見其終見共存共榮之實。</p>
<p>不言別的，法幣經過四年的戰事經驗，果然，上海黑匯市塲發生了數次變動，可是近一年來趨勢，不脫盤旋曲折，縱有無謂之謠詠播弄，而終於回復到原有的局面。未來的趨勢固難逆料，然觀於英美平準基金借款成就後，不久平準基金委員會將在重慶成立，美方委員已在赴渝途中，這樣地聯接下去，無論上海黑匯市塲有無變化，總之，法幣是法幣，不用如杞人之憂天。</p>
<p>又一方面，上海市塲的投機囤積，自從工部局公賣米上市，用實力打倒米蠹囤虎的百般居奇後，居然、如響斯應，不要說粉麥雜糧，有聯帶關係，同見平落；乃至於紗花布疋，亦不無興緻闌珊，行市奄奄。蓋投機之盛衰，在乎氣燄；氣燄一衰，一切鼓不起勁；非得另借機會，不易重振旗鼓。故米之投機風潮敉平，而其他之投機，亦相顧失色，雖未主消聲匿跡，而已非興會淋漓。足見要管制市面，須仗實力，還得具有決心，若使虛與委蛇，裝飾門面，非僅揚湯止沸，抑且厝火積薪。</p>
<p>一看市面，歷年來各業無不大獲盈餘，然不是眞有所獲，一則貨量同是這貨量，以物價不斷的上漲，纔顯得盈利纍纍可觀。二則幣量固然增加了，但衡其作用，則爲各物同樣暴漲，終於抵銷量的增加而有餘。三則一切人工開支亦比較的隨物價而酌增，開銷浩大，營業如稍淸淡，恐是得不償失。四則除非物價不斷上漲，各業尙可坐享其利；無如物價已高，終於限制購買力。只要消費者退而求其次，甚至於可省則省，可緩暫緩，已經足夠影響到銷塲方面；及至有貨不能銷，即使明明有賺益，亦是帳面虛花，實際上拆息開支等一併計入，焉知還不是虧本。</p>
<p>是以今日各業之處境，在在有折閱虧蝕之可虞。蓋物價不必跌，只要到停頓地步，已是無利可沾，有坐蝕開銷之可能。於是思牟大利者，不惜用盡操縱投機之伎倆，仍冀獲非分之利。而不念囤積居奇，只有在兩個條件下最有效力（一）非此不可，舍此別無替代品者：（二）司採銷之柄，貨物之接濟，非一時間所能購致者。即此二者，亦非穩若泰山，蓋人類善於適應環境，一時之困難，終於有法尅服，否則自有人類到如今，非但人爲之殘賊，即自然界，說不盡千災百難，歷無量數刦，而終於蕃衍之有正爲能戰勝環境之故。故投機家種種用心，終歸於曇花一現，適見其爲飛蛾撲火，自焚其身而已！</p>
<p>現在嚴重不亞於衣食者，爲住的問題。房地產原用以投資，故其利甚薄；而今一切投機化，房地產之買賣，亦失其正軌，爲饒有游資者之投機目的物。尤其自一般猶太人來上海，頓使上海股票及房地產業，發生甚大之波動，直接助長投機，間接提高物價，又造成一再增加房租壓迫房客的事實。無非利用出售，轉租，拆造，變更經租帳房，假借洋人的勢力，遂行其加租手段，大房東壓迫二房東，二房東剝削三房客，今日上海的居民，除了少數有資產及圃積致富的人外，大多數是食不飽，居不安。爲了房租貴這問題的嚴重性，勢必使一屋分室而居的愈衆，室愈窄，人愈衆，不僅汚穢齷齪，且易發生火災，釀成疫癘，最後，無非影響到整個社會的安全。故以糧食爲投機固當儆，而以房地產爲投機，儘量在增加房租，逼迫居室的空間减縮，同樣是威脅人生的一種殘賊行爲，理應加以取締。</p>
<p>就大體觀，現正羨慕着上海繁榮，而不知內容正是黑影幢幢，惟不知爆發在那一日！工具、吾人業巳以空前之生產速度、趨向此種目的、予今自美國帶來者、爲吾美人民所持之一種信念、即吾人相信貴國及美國人民所信仰之原則、必能永存、此一番事業、非常偉大、雖路徑或甚遙遠、但可以緊張之努力而成就之、」林主席答稱、「在爲自存及爲保存人類之生命自由及幸福等天賦權利、而作至高無上之奮鬥中、中國政府對於美國政府人民所獻身之主義及目的、殊爲欣慰、並感謝現時業已獲得及將來必將繼續供給各種援助、中國人民及其他酷愛和平之國家、對於美國政府以美洲爲民主國之兵工廠之偉大政策、實目有無限之欽敬、中國爲其他自由並堅決之民族、皆仰望美國以爲文明之最後保障、中國能與美國有憂戚與共、息難相交、此實吾人引以爲榮者、吾人相信中美所主張並維持之主義、必能存在」、外交部美洲司司長段茂瀾博士、在典禮中仟繙譯之職、呈遞國書完畢後、林主席即公宴美國之外交代表、行政院副院長孔祥熙、監察院長于右任、外交部長王寵惠、海軍部長陳紹寬、外次徐謨及其他外部官員多人俱參加公宴、（廿六日台衆社電）</p>

<h3>林語堂在紐約講演　中國民族之力量　上海酒家義餐捐救護車　助華會約名流熱烈參加　林氏列舉中國獲得勝利十大原素</h3>
<p>紐約華僑馮國英·曾禮賢·等、最近在紐約Roxy戲院對面新建大厦、開一最摩登餐館、定名「上海酒家」、馮君等爲報效國難起見、特與美國醫藥助華會接洽、於四月二十二日開張之夜將所有凈收入、全捐該會、以備購買載貨救傷兩用汽車一輛、送回祖國、作抗建之用、該會特組織一特別委員會、辦理此事、是夜開會後、公推中國銀行行長夏屏方太太主持節目、讀者選萃「Readeris　Digest」編輯福克森博十爲餐宴主任、助華會副會長許肇堆博士爲大會主席、林語堂爲主要講演人、此外並到作家賽珍珠、紐約巴納德女校校長基德施黎夫·宋子良·于總領事·中國銀行夏行長·紐約太陽日報杜戚士·作家米納等、此次餐會、有一特點應　別提及才、即所有來賓·大會主席·及全體辦事人員等、均付餐費、俾收入足彀購買一輛汽車也、</p>
<p>名流蒞會　盛况空前</p>
<p>開會　、首由主席許肇堆博士、介紹到會名人賽珍珠·巴納德女校長基德黎夫·「讀者選萃」編輯福克森博士·及于總領事等、許會長因作戰以來、在美助華運動、多賴于總領事從中推動、現在全美助華聯合總會得能成立、亦係于領事努力之功、故對于領事作熱烈之介紹、許會長詞畢、改由「讀者選萃」編輯福博士主席、旋林語堂先生開始講演、最後福克森博士報吿、是晚餐款收入、及到會來賓捐款、已足敷購車一輛之用、</p>
<p>林語堂氏　演詞精闢</p>
<p>林語堂氏講演詞全文、照錄如下、近代史中之最神秘者、莫如中日目前之戰爭、而中國人民雖遭不堪想像之痛苦、其偉大精神、則一仍如故、確爲世人幻想所不及也、戰爭開始之際、余謂此次戰爭、爲遠射砲與永垂千古哲　之戰爭、共結果則爲一僵局、據目下情勢觀之、哲理似將戰勝大砲矣、</p>
<p>中國民性　堅强不屈</p>
<p>當今之世、軸心國　、兇暴橫行、以爲惟武力始有最後勝　、然民主之邦、則信賴人類至高無上之大無畏精神、爲克服强權之最有效武器、坦白言之、吾儕所能希望央國取得最後勝利者、爲英國人民堅强不屈之特性、至於中國人民、則常被認爲不具此項特性、但以此次戰爭言之、中國能有今日之結果、在在足以表明堅强不屆之偉大國民性所能成就者爲幾何、此點不特可以打破過去之誤解、目爲吾人之最大良好敎訓、中國人民平時雖尙禮讓、但目前則堅强不屈也、</p>
<p>一面作戰　一面建國</p>
<p>中國最後勝利、現在確可斷言、然世人仍鮮有知共所以造成目下局勢之原因者、請待余加以解釋之余認爲此次作戰、能收神秘效果、由於一而作戰、一面建國、最近有遊重慶者、言重慶不斷的建築、不斷改進、似乎不知今夏仍有空襲之可能、似乎戰事已經了結、整個國家、忙於復興運動、去夏余亦眼見、在空襲之下鑿地道、開展公路、去冬且有一新建國立圖書館吿成、並新加一能容千人之大戲院、語云、不進則退、假使中國未曾前進、開發內地、作爲作戰之大本營、恐中國已完全不能相抗、故建國即爲作戰力略之一、明乎此、則能了解中國作戰力量之所以與日俱增矣、</p>
<p>勝利因素　計十大端</p>
<p>中國得有今日之勝利、實由全民一致擁護英勇的領袖蔣委員長、繼續不斷的實施原訂策略所致、舉其因素、有如下列、（一）全國人民能精誠團結、一致作戰從未有一將領受誘投降、（二）數百萬人民、寗願放棄家宅、逃至內地、不因飢寒交迫、埋怨政府、（三）所有士兵、無不奮勇、（四）因政府及各領袖均爲國官勤、爲民服務、博得信任、是以人民能不顧痛苦、等候最後勝利、士兵能不惜性命、英勇戰鬥、（五）開發內地、建築道路、遷移工廠·學校等等、均爲不可避免之事實、而均能一一辦到、頗屬不易、（六）不特原有軍隊、未遭擊散、且所訓練之新軍、日日增加（七）在游擊區內、政府留有大量游擊隊及正式國軍作極有効之破壞工作、（八）在廣大破壞中、反造成中國建設之新紀元、（九）託天之福、在此四年中、皆爲豐收、（十）黃河在三年中、未凍成冰、遂阻止日軍前進、亦大有關係、</p>
<p>偉大力量　擊敗武器</p>
<p>總之、實現中國作戰方略、不特仰賴各領袖共有遠大之眼光、亦靠人民能逆來順受、埋頭苦幹之豐功偉績、茲舉世界聞名之滇緬路言之、該路之成、世人草不認爲爲一人工幻術、假使該路不能爲人工所完成、或未及時建築、則中國不知將成爲若何狀况、所幸該路業巳完成、並在武漢失陷兩月之後即已通運、此可證明政府具有遠大眼光、及人民苦幹之偉大力量也、若從客觀派的歷史家、事事必須根據客觀條件具備眼光言之、則中國必被預料爲一事不可成、但中國確已成功、由此可知客觀的條件（武器）、有時不敵主觀的大無畏精神與堅强不屈的毅力、現在英國之器械方面、或較德國爲遜、但英國有堅强不屈之精神與毅力、故英國必可如中國一樣、取得最後之勝利、</p>
<p>美運艦漢特遜　昨日歸國　載三百餘美兵離此</p>
<p>美海軍運輸艦漢特遜號、載在滬服務期滿之美陸戰隊十兵二百二十叫名、於昨日（二六日）午後二時起椗、駛返美國、查該艦係上星期五日抵滬、載來瓜代美兵一百五十名、此數雖不足返美十兵之半、惟本市各界對此、不予申視、</p>
<p>荷輪仍駛遠東　並不輟航</p>
<p>據平明社記者昨　向航業界訪悉、荷蘭皇家輪船公司業已暫予停航之郵船、係爲Tegelferg得琪堡號、Bosscvain寳樹雲號、Ruys羅斯號等三艘、惟今後荷輪行駛遠東航綫、並不因此中斷、尙有其他荷輪加入繼續開航、並聞該公司之Lemapag里麥多號郵船、即將定於今日到埠、</p>
<h3>美記者斯蒂爾　環游南海印象　英荷澳已建立堅强防綫　中國民氣激昂無可威脅</h3>
<p>美國芝加哥日報遠東通訊員史蒂爾、於本年初川發赴南太平洋各地及中國旅行、先由滬赴香港、經新加坡及東印度羣島、然後至泰國、自曼谷遵陸抵仰光、經滇緬路而去昆明重慶、歷時四月、最近自重慶乘飛機返至香港、由港乘輪回滬、昨日對記者稱、荷屬東印度與英國、雖無正式的聯盟、但雙方有密切的合作、南海各地人民、均巳深信東印度羣島或英國在太平洋之屬地、萬一捲入戰渦、彼此將立即予以可能的援助、</p>
<p>泗水海軍　大見增强</p>
<p>史氏稱、新加坡與馬來之防務、較一年前已增强一倍、在東印度羣島、情形亦然、當荷蘭淪陷時、當地人民、皆甚沮喪、現則至形興奮、並知美國飛機常有至東印度羣島者、蓋在東印度羣島海上陸上、彼等均有根據地、且現正建造「蚊子艇」、在泗水附近之海軍根據地、最近亦大見增强、當地人民均覺彼等有極佳之軍略地位、足以抵禦外來之侵略、以爪哇四周之島嶼、可作爲甚佳之屏障、而各品人口、亦較爪哇爲疏、該處荷蘭人與英國人、均覺全部南海區域、彼此有密切之關係、巳不能互相分離、全部防綫、係由新加坡向南越東印度羣島而至澳洲之達爾文港口在澳洲部份、尤足重視、蓋澳洲爲英國在遠東之兵工廠也、南海各區之航空聯絡、亦大見進步、在戰爭延續之時期中、由美國經澳洲而至荷屬柬印度羣島之航空路綫、將更　加其重要性也、</p>
<p>重慶昆明　不懼空襲</p>
<p>史氏在緬甸所見、亦如其他各地情形相同、現正積極設防、據稱、緬甸新軍隊、大多數爲印人、昆明情形甚活躍、日機雖時往轟炸、但對民氣並無影響、當地居民現正變更工作時閒、自下午三時起至午夜爲止、日中已不復工作、重慶一切情形亦如常、目信日機轟炸重慶、決不能解決戰爭、以防空設備之效能既不斷增加、故轟炸亦無能爲力、目人民所有之汽車與動產、均可一部或至部栘人地下室、不致受轟炸之損失也、</p>
<p>港米應防　搜羅私運</p>
<p>公共租界安南路五十六號源盛祥米號、曾向泰潤雜糧行購去平價港米二十五包發售、不料於上週六（二十四日）下午二時、爲某探捕發現其所售之平價港米、略有異樣、據情報吿工部局、乃於昨日下午二時、特派探昌楊史權至該號調查、據該號中李某稱、並未攙雜、實係成色稍差、探員乃將其店中所存之十餘包　米、每包取少許米樣、帶回捕房詳查、再行處埋、</p>
<p>搜羅下絞　企圖出境</p>
<p>最近有某行、在市塲專門搜羅即將到埠之「德　」輪所裝之小絞米三萬包、企圖運往福建澳門並若輩竟以一二號混合碎冒充四號米粞、向當局領取搬出證、運往無錫、轉運杭州等處、以圖厚利、殊屬不法之極、務望兩租界當局予以嚴密注意、</p>
<p>賣米批價　尙在商議</p>
<p>據米業界消息、法公董局之貢米運滬發售、現正由雜糧行推派代表與局方商議承銷利潤問題、據米業界中人表示、目前公共租界工部局之平價港米、批發雜糧行每包價目爲一百二十二元九角一分、售與各米號之價爲一百三十三　五角、計得利潤的百分之八·五、今法公董局僅允給予百分之八利潤、實　公共租界爲少、故雙方尙未成議、</p>
<p>猪肉漲價癥結</p>
<p>本埠猪隻來源、因受統制、近日異常缺乏、而產地價昂、運費雜稅重疊、以致鮮肉價格飛漲、每斤竟售至三元、尙無應巾、市塲由經紀人私行分派、不顧販客血本仟意抑低價格、出售抬高、從中取利、肉價難漲、猪販仍須長木、多數至他埠營業、戰前肉業方面、例向猪行購入活猪、送宰牲公司宰殺後、川賣白肉、　被操縱、多數所謂經紀人、係肉商變相、將分得之貨、供其目己店中銷售、更有名爲猪行、實際將活猪不售與肉商、自行宰殺白肉零售與肉商、（即肉　俗稱掛肉）故小木肉商不能購得活猪自宰、幾經盤剝、肉價遂飛漲、釀成肉荒現象耳、</p>
<h3>濟南輪遇風　誤駛航綫觸礁　幸前艙套入礁尖未下沉　搭客由蘇州輪轉送回滬</h3>
<p>英商太古輪船公司南華綫正班船濟南號、載重二千一百餘噸、於上星期五（二十三日）中午十一時、由滬裝載客貨、起椗直放香港、當晚九時許駛舟山羣島附近、斯時天降雷雨、風浪交作、駕駛者失去控制力、悮走航道、觸入暗礁、</p>
<p>前艙洞穿</p>
<p>海水浸入、幸前艙套入礁尖、無下沉之危險、惟船身無法行動、該輪出事後即發電求救、公司接電、於翌晨（二十四）僱馬勒會德豐大號拖駁兩艘、派小工三十除人、隨搭兩拖駁輪、赴川事處頃備駁載濟南輪貨件、一方公司又電命由港來滬途中之蘇州輪赴出事處、載濟南輪乘客、蘇州輪已於昨日下午四時許到埠、濟南輪乘客一百十餘人、全數</p>
<p>安全返滬</p>
<p>據濟南輪乘客稱、濟南輪失事時、一時曾受虛驚、後知船身在礁上不致下沉、乃各安定、目下船頭聳起、公司派往之大號拖駁兩艘、正在駁載貨件俟貨駁淸、使船身浮起、然後再行拖拽出險、並將艙內海水抽去、洞穿處設法補塞、仍須返滬修理、聞該輪此次失事、旅客船員等均各安謐、行李物件毫無損失、惟前艙所裝之蔬菜及洋山芋等貨、一部被拋入海內、因須使船身輕浮起見、至回滬濟南輪乘客、據公司宣稱、可調換他船之船票乘船、或退票還現亦可、</p>

<p>法租界鐵門　昨仍關閉　有人越牆圖人南市　越捕開檢幸未命中</p>
<p>法租界與南市毘運各鐵門、自廿四日日憲兵隊長樺島菊二、在南市舊倉街被擊後、即實行封鎖、迄昨日尙未開放、被阻居民、鵠立鐵鬥內外、狀殊躑躅、據昨晨大通社記者親赴各鐵門巡歷、南市民國路上、巳杳無人跡、景狀荒凉、鵠候鐵門外之一部份南市居民、因氣候驟凉、尤爲縮瑟可憐、</p>
<p>越捕開槍　當塲被斥</p>
<p>又據大通社記者探悉、前（二十四）日下午一時、徐家匯路菜市路口、昆連華界處、因交通封鎖、一般在租界之南市居民、因無法通過、頗有跨越矮牆、以冀進入、當有站立該處四三叫號越捕、突向跨越矮牆居民、開槍一響、幸未擊中、當由另一法捕上前、將該越捕槍膛子彈取去、並斥以貿然開槍舉動爲不當、</p>

<p>向業股票之湖南人劉建武、平日有一三一七號自備小汽車一輛代步、本月二十四號晚十一時五十分、劉從成都路修德新邨友人處回家、正在踏　馬達開車之際、突遇綁匪三名出槍恐嚇、將劉綁上預雇之泰來汽車公司一二一一九號川差汽車、駛往靜安寺路靜安別墅二十四號公庽十號房閒內看守、並致函家屬、意圖</p>

<h3>李頓爵士深信　中國決不被人征服</h3>
<p>字林西報昨日刊載英國李頓爵士所著之專論云：本年三月間，羅斯福總統在其震動全世界之無綫電廣播中曾稱，中國與英國同樣應爲美國租借法案之受惠人，並享受美國所能給予之援助，以進行其對日之英勇作戰。吾人須知，中國從事於連續不斷之戰爭，幾達十年之久，其問從未獲得外助，卒能獨力作戰，而其作戰之目的，與七年後吾人被迫以武裝保衛平等自由正義之目的，初無二致。</p>
<p>中國決難　被人征服</p>
<p>中國目睹其國家被人侵略，人民被人屠殺，城市被人轟炸，而無防禦與報復之工具。設使我國（英國）皇家空軍之靑年飛機師，雖有才幹其經騐，而無機械以抵禦德人之轟炸機，又設使吾人無充分之高射砲以抵禦敵機之襲擊，則吾人之不幸將如何？然中國之遭遇，確係如是，其軍械之配備雖欠佳，但其奮鬥之精神，則數年如一日，作戰之勇氣，更有增無减，今日中國之無法被征服，已更甚於戰爭初起之時。</p>
<p>深悔當年　不予援助</p>
<p>倘吾人能於一九三二年時，即予中國以援助，則吾人不致目睹希特勒主義之崛起於德國；亦不致目睹戰爭之先後擴及非洲與歐洲。中國向以忍耐自勉，從不怨天尤人，中國深知吾人之苦衷與弱點，故僅得吾人空虛之同情，即已認爲滿意。但目下之情形，則大不相同，吾人已允以物質援助，並保證其必能運到，而中國則更挾此新希望作戰。吾人須知英國現正爲自由而戰，爲維護世界正義而戰，但此種自由與正義之戰爭，早已開始於一九三一年日軍進攻瀋陽之時。</p>
<p>羣相效尤　貽禍今日</p>
<p>一九一四　至一九一八廿犧牲無數生命之歐戰，其唯一之利益，實以　立一世界性之組織，以避免侵略之重演爲目的。此爲文明之一生命綫」亦即數百萬人流血所換得之「新秩序」，日本原爲强國之一，且爲「新秩序」之中要受託人，詎料其甘爲戎首，先自破壞此種「新秩序」。於是其他國家，有例可援，竟羣相效尤，結果，遂造成今日世界混亂之局面。吾人將來苟欲建設眞正之「新秩序」，必不可遺忘誰爲最先破壞秩序者，以及誰爲最先維護秩序者？</p>
<p>侵略行動　誰爲首創</p>
<p>今日歐洲之德義，其所採取之每一行動與方式，事實上皆由亞洲之日本首創其例。事前未經宜戰而奕然興兵，而猶名之曰和平，明爲友善而暗作敵對之　備，煽動隣國之紛擾，以造成武裝干涉之藉口，而猶曰恢復秩序，佔領他人之領土而自稱無領土野心，凡此種種，日本可稱爲最早之發明家。</p>
<p>將來必蹋　拿翁覆轍</p>
<p>戰爭後，其精神迄未受　，中國所受之犧牲雖大，但共人民之團結一致，爲以前歷史上所未有。日本造成中國之民族主義，亦猶拿破崙造成歐洲之民族主義，拿氏被其手創之歐洲民族主義所滅，故應付日本者亦必爲中國之民族主義。遠東之戰爭，爲造成今日歐洲戰爭之起點，故欲結束歐戰，必先以公正永久之辦法，解決遠東之衝突。</p>
<p>光明到來　爲期不遠</p>
<p>日人對於歐美之局勢研究甚殷，當世界其他國家止忙於經濟與政治之危機而無暇東顧之時，日本乃乘機對中國採取侵略之行動，便他國無從干涉，但中國人民深信中國決不致被日本所征服。反之，日本則甚爲米日之發展而憂慮，當歐洲自由之戰獲得勝利之時，卽亞洲淸算之日。阿比西尼亞所受之委屈，巳在伸雪，中國報復之日，亦已爲期不遠矣。</p>

<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、續趨平疲、因衆料今晚美總統爐邊談話、美德間恐從此緊張、各力人心本在虛疲之際、後聞日商銀行猛拋美匯、鬆勢突著、故於晚牧前之半小時內、下跌轉速、蓋起初雖德孚·時和·慶泰永及散戶等不斷吐出、但外匯穩定、本月期美金反因投機家補空而稍轉軟、成記德成力進、市勢於午刻曾轉弱爲强、向提上至六千三百九十九元、時有　德衝突傳說、阻住上升、下午初少變動、然於穩中巳復呈軟狀、距至三點半後、外匯報鬆、證券幫益大·錢兌業順源力售、展開跌勢、銳落見六千三百六十五元、終續軋小卅一元、全日交易一萬五六千兩、掉期（五月轉入六月）成交日少、賣方貼川予買方七十五元現金由永豐餘出方九霞及寳成公記共七十兩、價照期交高三百卅五元、下午永豐餘出祥和一百兩、價高三百廿五元、熾大出德孚一百卅兩、高三百卅五元、比上週六軋小卅元、飾金小五元、計六百九十元、關金等均平、</p>

<p>經濟　谈　馮柳</p>
<h3>銀行（四）</h3>
<p>時戶部方於二月十三日（光緒三十年）請設立銀行，成本四百萬金，戶部任籌其半，餘下二百萬，招商入股，月息六厘（按即爲開設戶部銀行之張本）。但以咸豐年間發行鈔票，光緒二十五年舉辦昭信股栗，米能取信於天下，商民愈涉疑懼，一聞官辦，動輒蹙額，視爲畏途，故蔣式瑆父云：「慶親王之款，何不命其從匯豐銀行提出，撥交官立銀行人股，俾成本易集，可迅速開辦。而月息二厘之款，增爲六厘，慶親王私產亦大有利益，商民亦釋疑懼而踴躍加人矣。」</p>
<p>摺入，派鹿傳霖至滙豐銀行澈查；該銀行總經理熙禮爾，買辦楊紹渥，不受調查；均稱「銀行向規，任何人存款，不准告人，帳目亦不准示人；」遂無結果而返。蔣式瑆因以受處分，革去御史，轉向原衙門行走。</p>
<p>此可見官僚財產逃避於洋銀行者甚夥，故即使西太后無此舉，而皇族貴戚中有此事，亦未可知。况當時各洋銀行在北京設立分行，其唯一營業，無非吸收官吏私蓄等於無息之存款，即以之轉貸於淸廷，擴張其在華之勢力。華俄道勝銀行在庚子（西歷一九〇〇年）拳亂時，曾遭洗刦，匪羨匯豐銀行多銀，圖刦未遂，時人有詩咏其事云：</p>
<p>「華俄西去匯豐存，雪白紋銀百萬屯；想發洋財人似蟻，崇文鬥接正　門。」</p>
<p>自法蘭西銀行併於道勝，法獨無銀行在。且其時淸廷軍需賠款，財用大絀，開源無門，輒以路礦實業，向洋商舉債爲事，借款擔保之巨，利益之厚，條件之苛，同佣之豐，莫與倫比。法人能不無動於中，乃將共經營安南殖民地之Banque　De　L’Indocine印度支那銀行，向設於西貢者，賦以特權，分設來滬，的在光緒一十四年（按二十四年爲西曆一八九八年，該行總行設於巴黎，開辦於西曆一八七五年即光緒　年，）以一百萬　資本，來滬開設，即東方滙理銀行是也。不久而盈利纍纍，支分行遍於南北矣。其先設於漢口路江西路西邊，後遷於法租界外灘今中法工商銀行基址，三遷於今址，即法蘭西銀行舊址也。（未完）</p>
<h3>糧食　思將滬米向外流　米蠧囤虎興奮有加　所幸兩租界公賣米不絕而來</h3>
<p>洋米昨市客囤活躍、市　頓呈與興旺騰達之氣象、期現各貨莫不一致飛升、而投機囤虎與操縱市儈又圖捲土　來、借邇日洋米內銷甬紹、與日商運銷等擴大官傳而皮球幫帽子幫更見暗中活動、故早市開價之後、高次各洋米與英華司期貨莫不一致上漲、結果盡比上週六漲起一三元、下午雖經禁阻、而人心依然激昂、但港米來滬源源不絕、第三批已經抵滬待售外、四五批亦經接洽彼運、而法公董局之平賣越米亦有五萬包已經到申、即於一日發售、其售價與一切手續、盡照公共租界工部局之成例公開辦理、其造福市民與安定米市之功績甚爲偉大、囤虎市儈雖圖活躍、然恐未必能售其操縱也、買賣尤着申於小紋與敏黨、本街實銷、對於二號西貢暹羅等中段貨、納意亦濃、新囤及一般散戶、從中作浪、各價一路直上一號西貢開出百十九元至百二十元、二號達百十五元、二號暹羅百十二元、小紋百十四元、敏黨用百十四元一躍至百十八元、申京砶尖白十元百零九元、次百零四元半、碎尖九十一二元、總觀以上各價較之週前、雖均增高、而頗多參差、自一二元至三四元不一、實以各貨去路不同、有所軒輊、英華司小紋一百三十六七元、一號西貢一百四十三元半至一百四十四元半、碎米一百零三元至一百零五元、全日成交現米二萬五六千包、英華司一千五六百噸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、因一朝停市、到貨稍厚、故雖昨日本鄉去　頗暢、貨主難以扳售、結果無論厚薄兩粳行情、與週前相仿、　開無錫鮮粳百三十四元、崑山鮮粳百三十二元、次至百二十八元、南港早晚稻新鮮百三十二元、百二十元、特別百三十四元、次宿者乏貨無市、原包白三十五元至百三十二元</p>
<p>糯米端節當令、去路較興、但趕節應市之貨、亦屬不弱、是成供求兩平、市面卒乏變化、香港白元仍開百十二元、至次號粒百零八九元、國糯特別原包售百二十四元、</p>
<p>囤虎米蠢勾結一方猶在操縱居奇、工部局採銷甸米、由港轉運來滬、源源不絕、太古公司漢陽一南寗兩輪前日（二十五日）到滬、各有　萬包運來、蘇州輪昨日下午抵埠、亦由港運來一萬包、江蘇輪祇裝來五千七百包、昨巳開始起卸、法公董局採銷之貢米、第一批亦已抵滬、裝法公司霞飛將軍號郵船於前日（二十五日）晨到埠、該輪由西貢直接裝來三千六百噸、約　萬七千包之譜、聞內中一部尙係客貨、（祖）</p>
<p>豆餅頻頻出籠</p>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅　面、依然廻旋之勢、刻下豆油底存雖被調劑公司一手把持、　銷塲呆滯、勢難振作、黃豆苞米略形轉升、但豆餅因大局不利多　、致出籠頻繁、行售步瀉、中　雖有掙扎、然頹勢已成、結果比上週末挫跌六七角不等、統計做開大連豆油五十件、價詳市價欄、膠州生油一百件、歸德黃豆一千五百餘包、膠州豆二百包、天津豆四百包、父靑豆一百四十包、期現苞米共成交二千包、甡記各餅五萬餘片、二十七日有苞米一千五白包運烟台、</p>
<p>證券　公債買戶見增</p>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况趨勢略强、天生之繼續收買、裕興及新華均有收進、趨勢漸見漲風、但迁緩則在所不免、昨日上午、天生及裕興買進甚湧、存益及久豐進胃亦不躬、賣方爲鴻大聯和大通同康亦稍出脫、午收比較爲堅穩、午後交易爲多、甲種在新華及聯益買進中直綫上騰至六元、天生及裕興進胃仍濃、瑞裕亦有需要、供給者大都爲同順恒孚辛孚易中仁昌等零星斬多及拋空、惟各項均見略堅、市價結果回漲一二角至五角半不等、以甲種上漲爲最多、成交總數共計約一百三十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新新公司股五十股、價爲十九元五角、</p>
<p>衆業股市靜中帶軟、當日價格幾無變化、</p>
<p>紗花　日紗布價大落　雙馬套賣復盛　港銷似稍轉機　市盤欲振反挫</p>
<p>紗市仍小離盤旋之　、但局勢甚挫、因之漲力尤疲、不過港幫採辦停滯已久、頗有靜極思動之象、故本日買去一十支、二十二支及十支紗的計九百包、足使呆疲不振之人心、提升一步、所以市態軟中帶昂矣、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百二十五元、低價爲一千四百十五元、午後開盤續穩、因午收良好、且廣幫稍有交易、人心安定、初做一千四百二十四元、旋以大戶吐川拋空者復來、跌至一千四百十七元、在十五六元之閒廻旋殊久、豈　三點以後、聞取引所紗布市價大落、人氣頓鬆、且有一部份突來套賣、忽落至一千四百〇七元、嗣後扒補的人們活動、父好至一千四百十二元、結果以外滙趨鬆〇三一二五、最　收盤價爲一千四百〇五六元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開續疲、首盤價爲一千四百十九元至二十元、但盈利者扒空、檯面轉緊、少頃漲至一千四百二十五元、繼聞外滙勿動、標金平庸、市態又軟弱、跌至一千四百十八元、中途廣幫有現紗交易七八百包、呆木之人心、隨之振作、情况又復回至一千四百二十四元收盤、但檯面上交易不及上日之旺、查半日閒成交統計九千九百包、香港幫辦九百包、同行及業外皮球交易則佔九千包、</p>
<p>棉市平庸</p>
<p>現棉情况、復趨平庸、良以紗市乏力、以致臂齒相依之棉市、亦受其牽掣、雖號家間有掉動、惟因廠方實需不張、及各方尙乏有利影響、致交易仍屬寥寥、昨共做開一千零五十九件、價尙平定、</p>
<p>疋頭　東疋狂瀉　廠布售盤參差</p>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢續軟、良以月底將屆、各方觀望不前之故、售盤因貨多寡關係、互有差別、白貨粗布·粗斜堅挺如恒、而細布·細斜續趨下落、每疋二角半至五角、漂染布一部份跌五角左右、本街成交各布四百餘件、粵港南洋幫辦粗布·粗斜·色斜藍布二百餘件、十六磅飛鴻粗斜港售十三元、合法幫五十八元餘、績有採辦、二十七日疋頭運烟臺一百二十五件</p>
<p>東布　跌風又熾、蓋以取引所空戶活躍、賣氣濃厚、龍頭細布期貨逐盤在瀉、每疋猛跌二元左右、致現貨市塲一致　落、後市廠棧單售開四十四元三角半、較上週跌達一元八角、色貨四君子嗶嘰午前爲一元四角一分三七五、晚收亦降至一元三角八分半、跌三分半、比較尙堅</p>
<p>呢絨市面轉呆</p>
<p>呢絨市昨日大有轉呆模樣、　客幫早已停辦、本街門莊幫、因天熱實銷　少、需要步减、西服幫為已屆端午節、預備催收賑目、大半悉抱隨銷隨進爲宗旨、夏令各貨市銷乃見呆滯、秋冬呢絨、則因空氣緊張、執貨者莫不居奇、任　狂喊價目、致雖有需要、而心思已不如旬日前之濃厚、</p>
<p>絲茶　絲經外銷仍未暢</p>
<p>昨日紐約因星期無市、橫濱電訊、絲價微升五元、期貨漲七元、對外絲銷仍未暢、昨日洋莊僅成交五包、價尙牛定、用戶絲銷、亦見停滯、因之市氣甚形淸疲云、</p>
<p>糖市　荷赤續跌三元　粗白市況亦步軟</p>
<p>昨糖市無甚軒輊、但仍不脫軟象、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白二月份到貨爲一百〇三元、五月底期貨初爲一百〇四元二角、旋升至四元四角、　仍回至四元、四元二角、六月十日期貨上午一百〇五元五角、五元〇五分、五元二角半、下午一百〇五元一角、後鬆至四元九角·八角、比前日小三角、荷赤現貨八十一元、比（十七日）小三元、又昨日杳港來糖八千二百二十包</p>
<p>海味　西洋海參　開盤穩固</p>
<p>西洋海參、近來略有運到、開過一批、爲數不多、市勢穩固、如玉參揀條四百七十七元、出辦四百六十八元、一號四百三十六元、二號四百十一元、三號三百六十六元、赤參一號二百四十五元、二號一百零九元、三號一百六十三元、叫號一百三十六元、烏員參大四百二十一元、中三百六十九元至三百三十四元、小二百十八元、方參大四百五十六元、中三百六十九元、小二百六十八元、梅條參出辦一百九十四元、一號一百八十三元、二號一百五十二元、圓烏參大一百八十力元中一百七十一元、一號小一百五十四元、灰岩參大三百九十一元、中三百三十九元、小二百五十九元、烏岩參大三百四十四元、中二百九十四元、小二百四十五元、抽皮參一百二十七元至一百十七元、禿參如頂禿八百七十九元、頂大禿七百七十七元、大禿六百二十八元、中禿五百六十六元、小中秃一百五十一元、小秃三百十二元、</p>

<h3>升學就業指導要義（一）  沈光烈</h3>
<p>升學就業指導、擴大範圍來說、就是教育指導和職業指導、敎育指導除了升學問題以外、最顯著的如性能測騐、志趣調查等、都是很重要的工作、職業指導最簡單的說來、是要幫助個人選擇職業、預備職業、獲得職業、和改進職業、就業問題亦不過是其中的一環、從兩方面分析歸納、父都屬於職業敎育的領域、敎育與職業發生了聯繫、才能切合社會需要、而有實用的價値、職業採用了敎育的方法、才有科學的依據、而可獲得正常的發展、如何使敎育界與職業界溝通、携手幷進、是很値得注意的一個問題、</p>
<p>據上海職業指導所的日常工作經騐吿訴我們職業界用人、確有逐漸改進趨向、並不完全採用從前的因襲制度、近來除注意考　人才外、對於工作人員的職業訓練、服務道德、知能修養等等、有多處在實施進行、當然是可喜的現象、而學校中培植靑年、亦頗能關懷及學生出路、作實際指導、近來每於寒暑假之前、各校類多有升學就業指導之舉、便是很顯明的例子、現在職業界的訓練問題、暫且不談、先就目前各校正在設施升學就業指導問題、作一個簡要的探討、在說明這工作之前、應有幾個基本的認識、</p>
<p>（一）升學就業指導是一種長期工作、現今各校在假期前對於畢業生施行測騐、請人演講、個別指導、實習參觀等、當然都是很好的方法、不過僅止於此、一年一度或兩度的工作、實嫌不够、不單平時應有整個的計劃、即在畢業後仍須有繼續的指導、保持相當的聯繫、決不是短期的臨時的例行工作、</p>

<h3>鷄</h3>
<p>— 味橄</p>
<p>過去三十年，我都是過的都市生活，尤其是住在上海的弄堂房子里，仰頭看小到幾尺天，脚下更是踏不到一寸土。宅前唯一的一個小天井，也都是敷着水門汀的，長不出一根草來。每日呼吸的都是煤烟，沒有一點淸氣。雖說是靑草年年綠，百花　樣開，春來春去，我們都沒有看見。並不是爲着什麼封侯事業，也竟背棄了這麼多年的大好春光，想起來眞覺得有點寃枉，然而你要到鄉下的家裹去住的話，是沒有人會給你飯吃的。生活還是第一，求名求利，都要以生活爲大前提，先要解決了吃飯問題，然後纔能談到進取，談到享受。我們住在都市之內，商塲之中，不知者總以爲不是求名，就是求利，或是在幹着一種求那名和雙收的勾當，其實並不是那麼一回事。說來也可憐得很，我們不過只是一個都市的寄生者，靠寄居在都市中，混一碗飯吃而已。脫離了都市，雖說有烏語花香，淸風明月，可以枕泉漱石，可以坐月醉花，可以聽採菱的歌聲，可以看農夫的播種，但我們這些搖筆桿的文人，對於田園只是一個旁觀者，而不是一個生產者，歸田要做過多年京官，有了相當積蓄然後可，現在我名旣未成，利亦未就，怎能離得了都市？爲着餬口，爲着養家，結果就是這樣年復一年地寄食於都市之中，辜負了多少春秋佳日，而不知老之將到。</p>
<p>在童年的時候，也曾在鄕下住過，門外就是水田，靑山白雲，朝霞暮靄，可說完全是與大自然爲伍，那種生活最令人憧憬，最使我回憶，幾十年來總想努力做點事業，好把生活問題解決，早日再回釗那種田園中去。然而至今一事無成，而大戰却爆發了。</p>
<p>戰爭只能給某些人一種發財的機會，對於我們文人，是絕對沒有好處的。不意這次戰爭，竟把我們從都市里趕將出來，使我無　中又得接近田園，而且得在離城遠遠的郊外，蓋着一所茆屋來住，倚山臨流，周圍有的是隙地，草色入簾蟲聲透壁，客來都說風景不壞，我也沾沾自喜，認爲富於詩意，讀占人「怪來詩思淸人骨，門對寒流雪滿山」之句，自已也彷彿成了詩人，可以受得起這種恭維了。</p>
<p>然而詩是無補於實際生活的。即令我是一個詩人，能吟風弄月，做川幾首淸人肌骨的詩來，又有何用？倒不如學農婦們養幾隻雞，還來得實用多了。</p>
<p>「你有這樣大的園子，大可以養雞：它們有的是野食可尋，用不着喂多少食料。」那些沒有詩人氣質，而却善於治家的太太們，來到我家里，總不免要這樣說。</p>
<p>我一再地聽到她們這些話，也就頗爲動心，或者不如說，食指動起來了，（不消說，這時詩神早巳唾棄了我而他去。）是呀，我要利用這個環境來養雞，只消養十隻雞，將來每天生十枚蛋，就値得兩三塊錢，而且現在買一隻雞要十多塊錢，十隻雞也就是一筆財產呢。</p>
<p>幾十年來好容易纔過到這樣一個環境，眞是早就應該從事那種有百利而無一害的養雞事業。有關生產，事不宜遲，第二天我從學校回來，路上遇到賣小雞的，我便向他買了十隻。那些小雞從籠中放川來，得到這樣大的一塊自由天地，其樂決非我們這些爲事務覊身的人，所能領會其萬一，雖則它們是載着一種有殺身的厄運而生的，然不到最後那個時候，它　決不知道。不知就是幸福，所以我可以斷定，它們在短短的生涯中，是比任何人都幸福的。（未完）</p>

<h3>兩兄弟合用三隻眼</h3>
<p>— 錢昌年</p>
<p>弟弟：</p>
<p>五月十二日接到祖父的手書，驚悉你在澳門因校中舉行化舉實騐失愼，炸傷右目。同時還有同學多人受傷，而你却是其中最不幸的一個。</p>
<p>祖父的信上又說，肇事的第二天，便由庶祖母親自伴你赴香港黃醫師處求治。這樣才使我們略爲安心一些。</p>
<p>五月十九日，又得祖母來信，說黃某必須先付醫藥費港幣三百元，而且要一次付淸。可是祖父眼前祇餘港幣二百元，往來磋商，延誤多日才改入香港皇家醫院診視。此刻細想，你右眼的卒吿失明，完全是時日遷誤的過錯。而這過失的一部却　歸罪於社會上很普見的這一類爲「金錢」而服務的醫者。</p>
<p>祖父的第三封信（是五月二十二日正午抵達）終於帶來了不幸的訊果：你的右眼因傷勢沉重，難望復明，若再不根洽，二三年後還恐曾拖延到左目。</p>
<p>當父親看到這封信時，我見他默然呆立了好一會。飽歷世故的他，眼眶上沒有淚水不能說明他是沒有悲哀的，他的心中正爲他那遭到磨難的兒子底未來幸福而禱吿。</p>
<p>母親和一姐以三妹，四妹她們知道消息之後，分藏在幾處門角落裏淌淚。我怎能代你勸慰她們呢？我自己的眼中早也含飽滿的水分了。</p>
<p>你呢？你是我們之中一個最不幸者，我明白你的痛楚：在爲自己悲憤之外，還抱有使合家中每一個人爲你分擔一分苦痛的歉忱。</p>
<p>一別六載，料不到我們就快相逢時，你却獨自遭到這一個無妄之災。今年六月間是你二十歲的生辰。我們預備見面時爲你舉慶。可是，這一來，有什麼可以慶祝的呢？</p>
<p>你的聰明，你的毅力，你的仁孝是兄弟行中最出色的一個，偏偏遭此災禍，是因造物之忌嗎？</p>
<p>我痛心慚愧，徒爲人兄長而對你的切膚的痛楚竟一無辦法。除了今後加倍的愛護你，你所得的是什麼呢？你已失去任何代價不能贖取的快樂了。</p>
<p>幸而，你還有一隻左眼可以使用，不，你還有比以前更多的眼睛可以使用，因爲你哥哥的一雙眼今後會隨時隨地看顧你，保護你，直至我的生命了結爲止。</p>
<p>我希望看了我這封信後，能「眞正」感釗一點快樂。虛僞的同情我是不願施捨給你的。我要你知道，我們是共同而不是單獨活着！</p>
<p>當我們重逢時，我要再見到你和從前一樣動人的笑。你答應我嗎？祝健康</p>

<h3>我是三個孩子的媽</h3>
<p>— 菲</p>
<p>當我想釗一個結婚纔四年的我，已經是三個孩子的媽了，就會感着無形的恐懼，煩悶，愉快，輕鬆，—錯綜的心，說不出的矛盾。</p>
<p>每一個孩子，都是我痛苦的紀錄：</p>
<p>懷孕時，除了生理的病態（連胃汁也嘔川來），還得搬着大肚子逃難。</p>
<p>絞腸似的腹疼，一陣加上一陣……我的心像凍着的冰，沸着的水！</p>
<p>但，這是泡沫，一瞬間就消滅了，消滅得見不到影縱，陳跡！當我看見」個眯白的小天使躺在我的床邊，什麼却忘了——忘了仟何的愁苦。我喜歡地上父多一個小生命，我祝禱這小生命的滋長！</p>
<p>琪，璞，璿，眞像他們的名字一般，同樣是一塊美玉，同樣作了我心裹的寳貝！</p>
<p>我的心，深深地和孩子連繫着，每時每刻，我注意到他們的衣食，睡眠，游戲。上街時，我會注視到玻璃櫃內陳列着童裝；買菜，我首光擇琪愛吃的洋柿子，胡蘿蔔；有什麼新奇的玩具，我不忘給他們罩一樣。</p>
<p>一天到晚，爲着照顧孩子，忙的我透不過氣來。</p>
<p>我還得當心孩子們身體的健康。孩子們一聲哼叫，等於我心中着一枚針，直到他們的病好了，針纔拔去。</p>
<p>三年的訓練，我的神經顯得分外敏銳，孩子們輕輕地一響，我會立刻醒過來，催他們重入夢鄕。瞧着孩子們蘋果也似的臉，陡時，使我奮興起來</p>
<p>有了孩子，我沒有享受遇頭夜的香睡；有了孩子，我也無暇顧到脂粉深淺，皮鞋高低，好像宇宙中給我的安慰和寄託，只有孩子了！</p>
<p>我不承認這是犧牲，但我願意盡做『媽』的責任。</p>
<p>『我愛媽媽！』當琪怪俏皮地吻着我時，幾乎使我樂得跳起來，還有什麼疲倦，煩悶！</p>
<p>孩子呀，媽並不矛盾！就是，媽也要　續這個矛盾到永遠！</p>
<h3>敎育是……</h3>

<p>經騐就是生活，生活不是在空虛裏面的，乃是在環境裏面，而且由於這個環境來的。</p>

<p>鐵獅子胡一十七號袁宅，爲熱河鎭守使袁寳藩之別第，除袞之一妻三妾同居一宅外，其姪袁紹文，（年二十四歲，未婚，現任熱河鎭守使署一等秘書，象陸軍第三十一混成旅旅長。）每隨袁鎭守使來京時，亦常下榻宅內。昨晚袁紹文因事向馬弁季兆雄（年二十九歲，山　　縣人）質詢，主僕突起爭吵，袁在怒之下，竟出懷中手槍，向季轟擊，當被　中耍害，即刻身死，事後袁即立投京師警察廳自首，留獄候審。據記者探悉，該馬弁向在天津英租界袁宅充侍衛，自來京至被殺，先後不足五日云』。</p>
<p>秋海棠把這一段短短的新聞看了好許多時候，在玉崑想來，總還道是他因爲僅剩了一個眼珠的緣故，所以看得比別人格外的慢了，但實際上秋海棠是早已看完了，他只是睜大着一眼，默默地在出神而巳。（一一六）</p>

<h3>泰羅鮑華的婚後生活——寫在他結婚兩週紀念日</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>兩年前的今天，正是泰羅飽華以大刀闊斧的精神，迅雷不及掩耳的手段，不徵求公司的同意，毅然與安娜蓓拉在落杉磯結婚的日子。當時，一般影迷—尤其是女影迷—在失望之餘，都以爲這位風流小生從此完了，他走上了錯的道路，佳麗滿眼，他不該與一位已結婚過一次的異籍女星結婚；不但影迷們作是感想，就是許多報章上也作此等言論。於是投機的預言家也作出這樣的預言來了：「一九四〇間泰羅鮑華與安娜蓓拉行將仳離。」然而如今一九四〇年過去了，他倆並未離婚，反之，他們間的愛情，却隨結婚的年月而增高呢！不信，請看他的婚後生活如何？</p>
<p>態度改變</p>
<p>以前，泰維是完全滿足於自已的翩翩風度，一笑迷人，使許多女人都爲之顚倒；可是結婚以後，就完全變樣了，由於安娜蓓拉的督率和鼓勵，態度轉趨於硬性。他竭其心力於工作，而目不畏艱難，努力以赴。他將來要以演技來著名，並不願以普遍好萊塢熱男子著稱。他的生活習慣已漸爲安娜蓓所同化，養成一種前進的高尙的藝術的趣味，與昔日浮躁好動的泰羅，巳判若兩人，這不能不說是一種奇事呢！</p>
<p>閨房敎讀</p>
<p>在這兩年中，他們除了工作以外，常常靜悄悄地在燈前夜談，以度良宵，安娜蓓拉爲他讀着法國名著，而泰羅四對她讀着莎士比亞。其初，安娜蓓拉給他翻譯，到現在攻習法文差不多兩年了，他自己證明是一個天資靈敏的學者，這樣的誦讀，對於泰羅實在是極有益的，不但足以增進智慧，而且亦有益於身心，這眞是很好的轉變呀，不能不歸功於安娜蓓拉，當然，賢妻是可貴的，尤其是對於像泰羅這樣的男子。</p>
<p>美滿伴侶</p>
<p>在泰羅心目中，安娜蓓拉確是一個美滿的伴侶，嚴肅與同情居首，而享樂則居其次，無論情形怎樣，他決看不到安娜蓓拉有着相反的心情，所以他非愛她不可了。婚後，泰羅的家亦不復爲好萊塢靑年們涉足之地，在那莊麗的家中，時時可以看到考爾門，却爾斯鮑育夫婦，華納裴士德，諸人出入其間，此外還有製片家和他們的妻子，安娜蓓拉見他所交接的，都是這般正人君子，自是歡喜，而泰羅亦深自慶幸着。</p>
<p>泰羅自白</p>
<p>有一次，泰羅很得意的對一位記者說：「你記得嗎？以前我對你說過，我理想中的妻子，是要有幽默感，莊淑誠實，自然謙抑，寬大慈愛，靈敏智慧，能担當一切意外的刺激，有「患難相共」的精神，並且她是一位電影演員，這樣才能了解我的生活和際遇，安娜蓓拉就是我的意中人，我所希望的，她完全都有。現在，我是得到眞正人生的樂趣，這樣的生活才有意義，心境愉快舒適，事事稱心滿意，但這一切我又得謝謝我的安娜蓓拉。」</p>
<h3>記平聲崑曲　社彩爨</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>二十四日是平聲曲社社友周健初的母親八旬大慶，該社全體社員特在湖社舉行彩排，從午後二時一直演到晚間十二點。這曲社巳有數十年的歷史，人才輩川，好幾年不會彩排過，這一次可算是難得的機會。</p>
<p>我去的時候，吳心齋正演三醉，扮相漂亮，唱亦工穩。接着是沈叔英的吃茶，一團正氣。陸成章和張延禎的賞荷尙是處女作，居然不慌不忙大是不易。吳倚南的寄子比以前販馬記的李奇演得好。徐小隱配其子嗓子甚爲響亮動聽。醉妃中張子方演唐明皇洒袖和跨步，頗能洒得開，飄逸有致。翁雲書演楊貴妃是初次上臺，亦中矩規。龔秉初的卸封頗能稱職。在仰眞的痴夢高唱入雲，聽了可以解渴；相反的是葛緝甫的亭會，音調極細。但葛氏已經五十五歲了，做工之細膩與沈靜，可謂爐火純靑，巳入化境。望月和望樹蔭的舉袖斜窺，尤爲美觀，殷震賢和葉小泓是老搭擋，以前看過他們的喬醋，現在又看到他們的跪池，新輪老手，自是不凡。朱堯文的見娘亦極熟練。藹堂說此戲情緒褊雜，面部可以有各種表情。我說：不妨破例，讓母親側坐，王十朋側跪，都與舞臺成直角，便可看見後者的表情了。歐陽予倩的新玉堂春便曾作過大膽的嘗試。</p>
<p>晚餐後郁炳臣的男舟在臺下嘈雜聲中過去，甚爲可惜。李恂如女士的後親，我已看過五次，一次比一次熟，身段甚好。殷菊儂女士的思凡理髮的姿勢極美，俯身至地的舞姿亦極佳，拂塵的運用極靈活。大軸是販馬記。王兆昌去禁卒，他的兒子去李奇。我說不是禁卒拷問李奇，而是單刀會裏的訓子。李奇的嗓昔極好。小鬍子爸爸也是成功的。蕭明京崑俱佳，前曾在璇宮看她演十三妹，此次又看她演桂枝，表現英武和溫柔的不同性格，更加覺得她的技術的圓熟，演什麼像什麼。沈衡一的趙寵極爲蘊藉儒雅，唱「你心中有什麼不平事」不撫桂枝之胸而以雙手微推桂枝之肩，唱「詳和細」時不拉桂枝的手向內向外甩袖，桂枝甦醒時不作揮汗的姿勢，也不說「險些又是一條人命」似乎都是有意爲趙寵立身分，不肯過火，而超乎俗伶之上。</p>
<p>影城雜寫　惠益　巴利穆亞獎掖後進　約</p>
<p>翰巴利穆亞是好萊塢銀壇上一個宿耆，論資格，沒有人可以及得上他，然而他對於後進的指導，是極端努力的，所以經由他指導的電影明星，多得不可勝數。約翰巴利穆亞每一次在拍影片的時候，就收許多學生，這些學生，就是攝影塲中比較空閑一些的演員，使他們可以得到實地的練習，最近他主演「隱身女人」，就收了許多學生，所以他有好萊塢電影界敎務長的榮譽頭銜。</p>
<p>洛麗泰楊較前得意　洛麗泰楊在電影界，年代已經很久，去年被環球請去，由名銀片家茀蘭克勞埃，攝製The　Lady　Fron　Chevenne以後，成績很好，所以接着就要攝製第一部，片名The　Nioht　Ours.</p>
<p>狄安娜竇萍任顧問狄安娜竇萍，最近被希臘　事救濟會聘爲顧問，由該會主席芮得畢親到攝影塲失要求她，她立刻就答應下來。</p>
<p>喬奇加入金星後，聞已派定在「雨夜槍聲」一片中，飾演兇手一角。</p>
<h3>「職業婦女」拉　雜談</h3>
<p>— 勞勃</p>
<p>「致遠劇社」，這一個名宇在上海的劇壇上是相當的生疏吧？其實，這個劇社便是早好多年前享着盛名的「曁南劇社」的別名。「致遠」是曁大愛好戲劇的男女學生們組織的。這一次公演的「職業婦女」，劇本是出諸於石華父先生的手筆，石華父先生是暨大外國語文學系的一位敎授。，而導演洪謨先生又是暨大的校友；這實在是一件太巧的事！「職業婦女」，是一個四幕的喜劇，裏面充滿了笑料和諷刺，針對着現實，在使觀衆在笑之餘，認識了一般貪汚者的面目。</p>
<p>飾演『君子』局長方維德的李駟就是常在本報經濟專刊寫稿的李君，演來很出色，祇是向張鳳來小姐求愛時的動作還有點彊硬，不大自然。演張鳳來小姐的露茜是今夏即將畢業的唐女士。唐女士以前在淸心女中及中央大學曾登台表演多次，所以經騐豐富，演得很是自然。演方太太的紫金，神態逼眞，使人折服。演方以拙的金沁，一股傻勁，常引得滿堂大笑；不過，動作方面有時稍爲過火一點，眞有點像『做戲』了！演長福的弓戈很稱職。其餘的平平，不過，飾方以慧的紅樓，演來不够活潑，而且發音太低，有時候，台下人不能夠聽見她所講的話。最後，祝「致遠劇社」各位社友猛晋，我希望在不久之後能看到他們更優美的演出！</p>

<p>第九章　憐君何事到天涯</p>
<p>他正在太息，柳隱夾已翩然而入，帶笑問道：「靖哥爲何如此深思？可有什麼難解決的事情嗎？」許靖不欲直吿，遂答道：「我想天下紛亂，內憂外患同時而起，張蒼虬等不知可在塞外立功？聞得流寇有窺伺晋省的企圖，意欲進犯京畿，其志不小，斷不可視爲弁兵潢池而忽之。現恨一般統兵的都非干城之選，庸懦無能，忽剿忽撫，游移莫定，以致寇燄日張，蔓草難圖，將來不知如何收拾呢？」柳隱英道：「尸位素餐的眞是可殺。弟聞當今皇上是個賢明之主，祇惜輔弼無人，國事日壞，他日若有機會，弟當與靖哥揮三尺龍泉，掃除這些妖魔。」許靖聽柳隱英說得如此熱烈，而又眉峯倒豎，義形於色，遂說道：「我當隨賢弟驥尾，同去烈烈轟轟地幹一番，庶不負男兒七尺之軀。」柳隱英聽了這話，又笑了一笑道：「十四萬人齊解甲，竟無一個是男兒，世閒有許多男兒往往偷生怕死，反不如夫人城娘子軍，也能捍衛國家呢。」許靖聽了這話不由一怔。柳隱英接下去說道。「小弟希望我等能够執干戈以衛社稷，爲國增榮，一雪泄泄沓沓之恥。」許靖笑道：「賢弟說得好爽快，稍緩數日我和你去見周遇吉將軍，好在他麾下效力。」柳隱英道；「我有一個脾氣，就是不喜歡去求見人家。至於功名不在心上，祇想隨心所欲，要留則留，耍去則去，所以不願意隸人部下，受人拘束的，否則我也何至隱居於此，落落寡合呢？」許靖點點頭道：「這就是賢弟的志氣高尙，淡泊爲懷，又是與衆不同的了。」晚餐後，許靖對柳隱英說道：今晚愚兄要想早些睡眠，明日也許耍吿辭下嶺，去城中走一遭呢。」柳隱央聞　，便道，「那麼靖哥早睡吧。我們有話明天再談。」於是柳隱英自回房去。他是和他姑母住在一室的。許靖等柳隱英退去後，他坐了一刻功夫，閉目養神。聽聽外邊已沒聲音了，速忙立起身脫下外衣，把赤鳳劍背在背上腰裏，又帶上百練索，熄熄燭火，輕輕地躡足走出臥室。把門掩上，又暗暗開了書室裹的一扇窗，跳到外面庭中，仍將那窗閉上。且喜牆垣甚低，許靖早巳一躍上牆，跳落門外。星光煜煜，叫顧無人，遂放開脚步走下鳳凰嶺去。他防備着狼，幸喜沒有遇見，又忽忽走過狻貌嶺，離了威鳳山，向代州城飛步行去。（七三—第九章完）</p>

He wished that God would lead China to victory, to restore balance in the Pacific, and establish lasting world peace. (Havas World News Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>Chongqing - U.S. Ambassador Gauss presented his credentials on the 26th. The translated version of his eulogy and Chairman Lin's response are as follows:</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador's Eulogy</h3>
<p>Your Excellency, Mr. Chairman, upon assuming my post as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America, and presenting my credentials and the letter of recall of my predecessor, I am honored, by the order of the President of my country, to express to Your Excellency, Mr. Chairman, the friendly respect of the President of my country, and on behalf of the Government of my country, to wish Your Excellency's country prosperity and its people happiness and well-being. The friendship between the people of China and the people of the United States has been long-standing and close. In recent years, your country's heroic struggle for self-defense has been deeply admired by the people of my country, and the friendship between the two countries has become even stronger, because both of us are free and resolute people. The people of your country, upholding the spirit of courage, the will of fortitude, and the ability to adapt, are working hard to rebuild the nation in the midst of hardship and adversity, which is deeply admired by the people of my country. The principles and objectives adopted by my country in the face of the current world crisis are understood by all countries in the world. My country is rapidly becoming a great factory to manufacture tools so that free people can resist aggression by force. We must make every effort to develop our increasing production capacity to achieve this goal. I am specially charged with the mission of my country to convey this to Your Excellency, Mr. Chairman, and I firmly believe that the principles shared by our two countries will ultimately prevail. Although the task is heavy and the road is long, we can strengthen our efforts to achieve success. The people of my country are convinced that the people of your country will continue to hold the position in these difficult times that they should have among the great nations of the world.

<h3>Chairman Lin's Response</h3>
<p>Your Excellency, Mr. Ambassador, it gives me great pleasure to accept your credentials as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to China, as well as the letter of recall of your predecessor. I am particularly grateful for the kind sentiments conveyed by Your Excellency the President and the Government of your country, and I wish to reciprocate with the same sentiments to Your Excellency the President and the Government of your country. Your Excellency the Ambassador has spent many years with the people of Shen Guo, and you are most familiar with the present conditions of our people, both good and bad, and you are especially aware of our needs and wishes. The fact that you are now taking up your post as envoy and revisiting this old place is especially significant at a time when this country is experiencing an unprecedented era in history, and new and old friends here will certainly welcome you sincerely. The Government and people of China, in order to defend the survival of the nation and to defend the inalienable rights of human life, liberty, and happiness (quoting the American Declaration of Independence), have been fighting resolutely for several years. It is gratifying that the principles and objectives upheld by the American Government and people are the same as ours, and we are especially grateful for the assistance already given by the American Government and people, and for the assistance that we will certainly continue to receive in our future struggles. China and other peace-loving countries express their infinite admiration for the great policy of the Government of your country in making the United States the arsenal of democracy. China, like other free and resolute people, looks to the United States as the last bastion of human civilization. In the midst of these stormy waves, we are holding the helm very firmly, and we are moving forward bravely toward the goals of justice, equality, and order. We also know that the days ahead will be difficult, and the future is still in its infancy, and we still need to strengthen our efforts. However, it is a great blessing that China and the United States share the same goals and have become friends in adversity. We, like your country, firmly believe that the principles upheld by the people of China and the United States will eventually prevail. I, as Chairman, would like to express to Your Excellency the Ambassador that the Government of this country will certainly provide complete assistance and all possible convenience for the completion of Your Excellency's great mission.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Aspirations of the Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>The fourth month is passing, tea and silk are coming to market, and the Dragon Boat Festival is approaching. This is usually the most prosperous and active time for the financial industry, but it is not so now. Just look at the state of leisure and idleness, and it is self-evident. Interest rates are low, and the discount on spot cash and drafts is between fifty cents and one yuan. It even goes to the point of creating new tricks. Spot cash and head transfers, which are normally the same thing, are now demanding a Shenshui premium, meaning that even for transactions of thousands of dollars, a difference of one or two yuan is clearly distinguished. This is not a reasonable action, but it reflects the abnormal Shanghai market: there is plenty of cash and abundant floating capital. The financial industry is very calculating and meticulous, hence this abnormal situation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, since the U.S. Congressional committee passed a resolution authorizing the President to continue devaluing the U.S. dollar, the Shanghai market had a brief surge of excitement, but it eventually calmed down. The possibility of further devaluation of the U.S. dollar is not new, and the way the situation develops is what is needed to adapt to the times. Not to mention further devaluation of the U.S. dollar, any other necessary measures will emerge as needed. The public does not need to be surprised by this, and this kind of action still contains constructive elements and is not entirely destructive in wartime. As long as we recognize the trend of the ABC countries continuing to cooperate, with their economies closely linked and forming a single circle, we will eventually see the reality of coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>Leaving aside other things, the legal tender has gone through four years of war experience. Sure enough, the Shanghai black market has undergone several changes, but the trend in the past year has remained one of meandering and twisting. Despite pointless rumors and manipulations, it has eventually returned to its original state. It is difficult to predict future trends, but considering that the equalization fund loan from Britain and the United States has been achieved, the equalization fund committee will soon be established in Chongqing, and the American members are already on their way to Chongqing. With this connection, regardless of whether there are changes in the Shanghai black market, in short, the legal tender is the legal tender, and there is no need to worry like the man of Qi fearing the sky.</p>
<p>On another front, speculation and hoarding in the Shanghai market, since the Public Concession sold rice on the market, using its strength to defeat the various price-gouging tactics of the rice weevils and hoarders, have actually had a resounding effect. Not to mention flour, wheat, and mixed grains, which have a related connection, have all seen a fall in prices. Even cotton yarn and cloth have lost their interest and the market is declining. The rise and fall of speculation depends on momentum. Once the momentum declines, everything loses its energy, and it is not easy to revive unless another opportunity is borrowed. Therefore, the speculation in rice has been quelled, and other speculations have also lost their luster. Although they have not disappeared completely, they are no longer thriving. This shows that to control the market, you must rely on strength and have the determination. If you are superficial and deceptive, just putting on a show, it is not only like ladling soup to stop boiling, but also like accumulating fuel under a pot.</p>
<p>Looking at the market, all industries have made large profits over the years, but this is not really a gain. First, the quantity of goods is still the same, and the constant rise in prices makes the profits seem impressive. Second, the amount of currency has indeed increased, but its effect is that all goods have risen sharply in the same way, ultimately offsetting the increase in quantity and more. Third, all labor costs are also relatively increased with prices, and expenses are huge. If business is slightly slow, it may be a losing proposition. Fourth, unless prices continue to rise, all industries can still enjoy the benefits. However, prices are already high, which ultimately limits purchasing power. As long as consumers retreat and settle for second best, or even save where they can and postpone what they can, it is enough to affect sales. And when goods cannot be sold, even if there is clearly a profit, it is just a paper gain. In reality, if interest on loans and other expenses are included, who knows if it is not a loss.</p>
<p>Therefore, the current situation of all industries is fraught with the risk of depreciation and loss. Prices do not have to fall; as long as they reach a standstill, there is no profit to be made, and there is the possibility of sitting and eroding expenses. Therefore, those who seek huge profits do not hesitate to exhaust all kinds of manipulative and speculative tricks, still hoping to obtain undue gains. But they do not consider that hoarding and price-gouging are only most effective under two conditions: (1) if it is indispensable, with no alternative; (2) if the power of purchasing and selling, and the supply of goods, cannot be obtained in a short time. Even in these two cases, it is not as stable as Mount Tai. Humans are good at adapting to the environment, and temporary difficulties will eventually be overcome. Otherwise, since the beginning of humanity, not only have there been man-made atrocities, but also the natural world has been filled with countless disasters and tribulations, and humanity has finally been able to thrive because it has been able to conquer the environment. Therefore, the various efforts of speculators will ultimately be a flash in the pan, and they will only be like moths flying into a flame, burning themselves!</p>
<p>Now, what is no less serious than food and clothing is the problem of housing. Real estate was originally used for investment, so its profits were very thin. But now that everything is speculative, the buying and selling of real estate has also lost its proper track, becoming a speculative object for those with surplus capital. In particular, since the arrival of a group of Jews in Shanghai, the Shanghai stock and real estate industries have experienced great fluctuations, directly fueling speculation, indirectly raising prices, and creating the fact that rents are repeatedly increased, oppressing tenants. It is nothing more than using sales, subleases, demolition, changes in management accounting rooms, and borrowing the power of foreigners to carry out their rent increase methods. Large landlords oppress second landlords, and second landlords exploit third tenants. Today, most residents of Shanghai, except for a few who have assets and have become rich through hoarding, are mostly not well-fed and have no peace of mind. The seriousness of the problem of high rents will inevitably lead to more and more people living in divided rooms, the rooms becoming narrower, and the people becoming more crowded. This is not only dirty and filthy, but also prone to fire and epidemics. In the end, it will affect the safety of the entire society. Therefore, while speculating on food should be guarded against, speculating on real estate, increasing rents as much as possible, and forcing the reduction of living space, is also a kind of atrocious act that threatens life and should be banned.</p>
<p>On the whole, people are now envying Shanghai's prosperity, but they do not know that the content is full of dark shadows, and no one knows when it will explode! Tools, we are already approaching this goal with an unprecedented rate of production, what I bring now from the United States, is a belief held by our American people, that is, we believe that the principles believed by the people of your country and the United States will last forever, this career, is very great, although the path may be very far, but can be achieved with tense efforts," Chairman Lin replied, "In the supreme struggle for self-preservation and for the preservation of the inalienable rights of human life, liberty, and happiness, the Chinese government is very pleased with the principles and objectives to which the American government and people are dedicated, and is grateful for the various assistances that have been obtained and will continue to be provided in the future, the Chinese people and other peace-loving countries have infinite admiration for the great policy of the American government in making America the arsenal of democratic countries, China, like other free and resolute nations, looks to America as the last guarantee of civilization, China can be honored to share the sorrows and difficulties with the United States, and believes that the doctrines advocated and maintained by China and the United States will exist." Dr. Duan Maolan, Director of the American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, served as the translator in the ceremony. After the presentation of the letter of credence, Chairman Lin held a public banquet for the American diplomatic representatives. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, Wang Chonghui, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, Xu Mo, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and many other foreign officials attended the public banquet.

<h3>Japanese Planes Spy on Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing - This morning, fourteen Japanese planes soared in the sky above here, apparently engaged in reconnaissance. The planes flew very high and did not drop bombs, but only a few machine gun shots were heard. An air raid alarm was issued at 8:30 AM and lifted at 10:30 AM. According to late-arriving news, during the air battle over Lanzhou on May 21st and 22nd, two Japanese planes were shot down. On the 21st, 47 Japanese planes attacked Gansu and Shaanxi, 27 of which bombed the eastern suburbs of Lanzhou. Chinese fighter planes immediately responded and hit the right wing of a Japanese plane, which caught fire and crashed near Gaoban Mountain (transliteration). It was a twin-engine bomber, and there were four charred corpses in the plane. Another two Japanese planes were damaged in the battle. When the Japanese planes returned after the battle, only 25 remained. Therefore, it is widely believed that another one crashed, but its wreckage has not been found. Another nine planes flew over a certain city in southern Gansu, and a third batch of eleven Japanese planes bombed Xianyang, Shaanxi Province. On the 22nd, another 25 bombers, escorted by 13 fighters, attacked Lanzhou, and bombs fell in the city and the eastern suburbs.

<h3>Zhou Enlai Calls for Unity of Army and People to Crush Japanese Divisive Plots; Break Japanese Blockade and Prepare for Counterattack</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the Military Commission and the Communist Party's representative in Chongqing, recently published a special article in the Xinhua Daily, calling on the people and army of the whole country to unite to overcome current and future difficulties, to crush Japan's divisive plots, and to mobilize democratic forces to break the Japanese blockade, so as to prepare for a counter-attack. Zhou believes that the current war will continue to expand and be prolonged, but does not believe that there will be a conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union's foreign policy is aimed at peace and neutrality. Unless Germany changes its policy towards Britain, it will not want to fight on two fronts. Zhou went on to say that the center of gravity of the war between Britain and the United States is in the Atlantic, not the Pacific. Although Britain and the United States will not re-close the Yunnan-Burma Road or recognize Japan's Asian Monroe Doctrine, it is not impossible for them to adopt a moderate attitude towards Japan in the hope of delaying the outbreak of the Pacific War. Although China's policy of resistance and nation-building is independent and autonomous, it does not want to be involved in the imperialist world war. However, this does not mean that we should not make use of the contradictions between imperialists, especially the contradictions and conflicts between Britain, the United States, and Japan.

<h3>Aid China Week Closes; Wilkie Delivers Speech: Says China is the World's Outpost of Freedom; America Should Aid China to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>New York - Wilkie yesterday, at the close of "Aid China Week" broadcasting, appealed for increased aid to China, because "China is the outpost of freedom in a world where freedom's edge is gradually tightening." Wilkie stated, "We should not turn a deaf ear to this appeal. We all recognize that countries around the world, whether in Europe or Asia, are fighting for the form of life and government they desire. The people of America should be determined to defend this outpost of freedom. Many people talk about not wanting to participate in the war, and some are concerned with keeping America out of the war." Wilkie urged the audience not to be misled by "impractical shallow views." He said, "When I am helping to put out a fire, I will not stand by and argue with the fire chief. The edge of freedom is tightening. People of America, I urge you to unite! If we stand strong with the countries fighting for democracy, we will surely win." New York Governor Lehman, New York Mayor LaGuardia, and Chinese Consul General in New York, Dr. Yu Tsune-chi, also spoke during the broadcast. Wilkie's speech was one of the greatest expressions of Sino-American friendship seen here in recent years. At the close of "Aid China Week," thousands of Chinese and Americans participated in a large parade. Other American cities also held similar celebrations. In Washington, 7,000 Chinese marched, along with 2,500 American students. In the New York parade, there were 150 overseas Chinese who danced a long dragon. New York National Guard Chief of Staff Hubbell was the grand marshal of the parade, leading the procession. Wilkie, Governor Lehman, city council members, and other important figures were on the reviewing stand. The New York Times also published a commentary on "Aid China Week," stating that there was no evidence to prove the Japanese claims of victories in Shanxi and Zhejiang meant the Japanese army had consolidated its new positions. The newspaper said, "The fall of Zhuji into the hands of the Chinese army is said to be a voluntary withdrawal. This is a clumsy way to present victory to the weary and doubtful Japanese people. The Japanese military has failed to prove during China Week that American aid to China is aiding a loser. If China can get a lot of help, it may open up the predicament and keep the Japanese army busy and unable to cause trouble elsewhere." (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>New York - American Republican leader Wilkie and New York Governor Lehman spoke yesterday at the close of the "Aid China Week" parade to thousands of people gathered at Columbus Circle, saying that the American people are now facing a major crisis. All Americans must stand on the same front with the democratic countries of the world to attack the aggressors. Wilkie also called on the United States to increase aid to China, because China is the outpost of freedom in the world, and now that outpost is feeling threatened. Wilkie's speech was broadcast. Wilkie said, "I am speaking today because I have a great concern for the country we love. We are now facing the most difficult crisis in history. Omnipotent countries with aggressive ambitions are trying to conquer the free nations of the world. Therefore, we should provide assistance to China, which is currently in need of help, and aiding China is an extremely correct truth, because China is our American outpost. Any event encountered in our East will also subject our West to the same treatment." Wilkie also said that he hoped President Roosevelt would give a straightforward, powerful, and courageous speech in his fireside chat on Tuesday night to promote the unity of the American people. Governor Lehman said in his speech that the United States must recognize China's firm determination to defend its freedom when threatened. China is now resolutely resisting evil forces, just as the United States is rising up to meet any possible threat. China now needs our help. If we can help them, China can continue to fight, or even win. We should not forget what the Chinese people have done for democracy, for freedom, and for the people of the world. It must be known that China is the first country to refuse to bow to aggressors and bullies. New York Acting Mayor Morris also delivered a speech, saying, "Tomorrow's storm will be a brutal storm. ABC (that is, America, Britain, and China) will unite to defend it." Of the three speeches, Wilkie's was the longest and most forcefully stated the necessity of aiding China.

<h3>US Senator Urges Escort, Intensify Aid to Democratic Nations</h3>
<p>Washington - The opinions expressed yesterday by two senior senators who often speak for the administration may indicate the direction of President Roosevelt's fireside chat on Tuesday. Democratic Senator Guffey, in a broadcast speech, demanded that the United States should escort goods to Britain. Democratic Senator Mead of New York, in a letter to Secretary of State Hull, demanded "immediate forceful seizure of the French territories in the Western Hemisphere," unless Vichy agrees to the United States using them as a base. Senator Guffey said, "We only have two choices now. If we do not escort now, we will be at war in the future." Florida Democratic Senator Pepper, who is considered to be a government spokesman, began a speaking tour to Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas City, St. Louis, and Detroit, urging increased aid to democratic countries. Pepper issued a statement saying, "The future of the world will be decided in the next five months. If we can hold on until November 1st, Hitler will not be able to conquer the world. Britain must obtain military raw materials and food, and the world's sea lanes must continue to be open. Our production rate must be accelerated by at least 50 percent." (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Chicago - Gallup Poll leader Gallup said here yesterday that more than half of the American people have not yet decided on the question of whether or not to go to war. Gallup said that the results of his research institute's recent tests show that those who support going to war account for 21 percent, and those who insist on not going to war no matter what, even if the Axis wins and Britain is defeated, account for 24 percent. There are still 50 percent, accounting for approximately 2.5 million to 3 million votes, who have not yet decided. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>After the Sinking of the HMS Hood, the United States Will Make Important Decisions</h3>
<p>Washington - After the British battlecruiser HMS Hood was sunk by Germany, members of Congress openly advocated giving Britain more effective aid, but are waiting for the White House to provide a more decisive plan immediately. It is expected that the President's fireside chat yesterday will not only indicate the speed of increased aid, but may also indicate accelerating America's own defense actions. The President's closest advisor, Rosenman, spent the end of this week with the President and helped him draft the text of his address to the nation. Rosenman's actions are enough to prove that the President will announce a grander plan, because it is extremely noteworthy for a judge to assist the head of the executive branch in preparing important documents. Nebraska Independent Senator Norris said that if the President's view is to use many warships to escort British convoys in the North Atlantic in order to save major shipping losses and enhance the anti-Axis trend, it is a good idea. He also said that American warships can be used by the British or Canadian Navy. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Hoerner Speculates That the United States Will Soon Go to War</h3>
<p>New Orleans - Lieutenant General Hoerner, leader of the US Reserve Officers Association, recently predicted that the United States will soon go to war, and said that the current situation is very serious. Hoerner also said that this is not just a European war, but a world revolution that may spread across the entire planet before peace is restored. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Washington - US Senator Norris (representing Nebraska) gave a speech yesterday advocating giving Britain more powerful assistance, believing that the United States should provide Britain with many warships. Now is a critical moment, and the United States should risk helping Britain. In any case, helping Britain today, even if there are sacrifices, will ultimately be less of a loss than the United States fighting Germany alone after Britain fails.

<h3>Japanese Businessmen Plan to Complete Southern Advance Plan Through Economic Means; Japan Seizes Goods in American Warehouses in Haiphong; Sends Aircraft to Demonstrate in the Sky</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to today's news, the Japan Department Store Association is considering a Japanese southern advance plan. This plan does not involve army and navy action, and does not require bloodshed. Japanese department stores are now planning to engage in advancement in Thailand and Vietnam. The method is either to conduct operations through a jointly invested company, or to distribute markets, with each market being handled by a Japanese department store. Also, in view of China's influence in Thailand and Vietnam, they will also consider wholesale trade methods. Currently, two of Japan's largest department stores are planning to send investigation teams to the South. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Saigon - The number of Japanese aircraft in Hanoi and Haiphong suddenly increased significantly today, and flew over Haiphong. American officials here explained that this action was a Japanese threat to prevent the French from protesting the Japanese seizure of all goods owned by Americans in the American warehouse in Haiphong on Sunday morning. The Japanese are showing off their force in order to make the French realize that it is useless to file a protest. At the same time, several Japanese merchant ships have sailed to Haiphong, ready to transport the goods owned by Americans that the Japanese seized from various American warehouses yesterday. American businessmen refused on Friday to hand over the keys to the warehouse to the Japanese. They handed the keys over to a French official in Haiphong, who protested the Japanese demand. But on Sunday morning, the Japanese seized the goods without notifying the Vietnamese government or American businessmen. These goods were originally prepared to be shipped to China, but at the time when the Japanese army entered Vietnam last year, American businessmen have been unable to ship the goods out since then. The Japanese claimed that these goods were owned by Chinese rather than Americans, and should be confiscated. The American Chamber of Commerce was ordered to hand over the keys at 9:00 a.m. on Sunday, but after the American businessmen refused their request, the Japanese seized the goods one hour before the deadline. The mayor of Haiphong immediately reported the situation to the Hanoi government. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>German Naval Commander-in-Chief Warns the United States</h3>
<p>Tokyo - German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder said in an interview with a Japanese news agency reporter stationed in Berlin that the US Navy's protection of merchant ships sailing to Britain not only violates neutrality laws, but also could trigger a war. Political figures here attach great importance to this, saying that Admiral Raeder's statement not only warns the United States, but also prompts Japanese public opinion to pay attention to this. According to the provisions of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy and Japan, Japan has an obligation to assist the Axis powers if they are attacked by the United States. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>New York - American newspapers paid close attention to the conversation between German Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder and a reporter from the Allied News Agency, but did not comment on it.

<h3>Increased US Mercury Production Hits Italy and Spain Hard; The Production of the Two Countries Previously Accounted for Four-Fifths of the World; Since Britain Bought from the United States, the Two Countries Have No Profit to Make</h3>
<p>Washington - Officials from the Department of Commerce recently stated that the increase in mercury production in Mexico, Peru, and the United States has seriously hit the monopoly of Italy and Spain in the world mercury market. Experts from the Department of Commerce also cited official news, saying that they believe the high-speed production of Italy and Spain will end, because the mercury industry in Mexico has been reactivated due to the large demand from Britain in the war. The British government, fearing that it would not be able to obtain mercury from Spain during the war, decided to purchase completely from reliable Mexico. The current annual mercury production in Mexico is several thousand vats. At the same time, production in Peru and British Columbia has also increased for this reason. Last year, the US produced 50,000 vats of mercury. In addition to 20,000 vats used for domestic industry, most of the remaining was shipped to Britain. Commerce officials continued, saying that the surge in mercury production was entirely affected by the war, and that they believe the profits made by Italy and Spain in mercury have now been fatally hit. It is said that before the war, Italy and Spain produced four-fifths of the world's total mercury production. Officials also pointed out that various machines in the European war need a large amount of mercury. Now, the source of mercury needed by countries around the world has changed, so the situation in the world mercury market has also changed. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting West of Canea, New Zealand Troops Fiercely Counterattack; No Changes in the Situation in Crete Yesterday; Germany Claims British Fleet Has Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Crete - Sunday was quite calm. This situation does not mean that the Germans have lost their strongholds. However, the airport occupied by the Germans is limited to Maleme. It is generally believed that when the Germans are rushing to bomb Heraklion and Rethymno, they may bomb their own troops. German aircraft have also dropped supplies into the British army. It is now believed that the enemy's position in Maleme is under the bombardment of the British artillery. The German claim that they have expanded their occupied area is exaggerated. Some German troops may have landed by boat from the small islands of Greece. According to Middle East public reports, only German troops landed in Crete by air. The situation in Heraklion and Rethymno has not changed. After German air reinforcements arrived in the Maleme area, they launched a fierce attack on the British forces west of Canea under the cover of intensive bombing. Although the German army suffered heavy losses, the British army's position was invaded. New Zealand troops counterattacked, and fierce fighting is continuing. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Cairo - Canea has not been bombed for three hours, and there are signs that Germany lacks paratroopers. This is the latest news from Crete.

It is said that German troops invaded the British army's position there yesterday. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Cairo - A British official report stated that German reinforcements carried by aircraft continued to land in various parts of Crete on the 25th, but on a smaller scale than before.

The main German position is in Maleme, between there and Canea, where hand-to-hand combat continued throughout the day. Both armies used dive bombers to bombard fiercely. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London - A British official announced today that German aircraft returned to transport tanks to Crete, but denied that Germany had effectively controlled all of western Crete.

(United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian officials announced that German troops transported by sea landed in large numbers on Crete on the 24th, and the fall of the island is imminent. The British report in Cairo also stated that a large German army transported by sea landed on Crete on the 25th. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German military command officially stated that the German air force attacked the British fleet during the battle of Crete and achieved great success.

(Haishe dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The first batch of German paratroopers to land on Crete encountered fierce attacks. They were surrounded and attacked by enemy forces, with very few numbers and heavy difficulties.

<h3>Rare Intense Bombing of Crete's Three Key Cities by German Aircraft</h3>
<p>Cairo - The fierce fighting between German and Allied forces continues in the Maleme area of Crete. Major General Heywood, head of the British military mission to Greece, returned from Crete last night. He stated, "I and the Allied forces can defend Crete. The evacuation of troops from Greece and the battle of Crete are part of a single operation. Considering the nature of the fighting in Crete and the difficulty of German forces landing reinforcements, I hope we have reached the final stage and can hold our ground. British Commonwealth troops and Royal Marines are engaged in extremely fierce hand-to-hand combat here." On Saturday afternoon, German aircraft carried out the most intense indiscriminate bombing of Crete since the start of the war. The damage was comparable to that of Rotterdam. German aircraft in waves dropped heavy bombs on the three key cities of the island, Canea, Rethymno, and Heraklion. The bombing was dense like raindrops and lasted for six hours with little respite. Heavy bombs hit the central areas of the three cities directly, forming straight lines of devastation. The commercial centers were completely destroyed, but the people remained as calm as those in London. Civilian casualties were minimal. Heraklion had already suffered heavy attacks on Thursday, and Rethymno on Friday. A British Air Force communiqué stated that British aircraft continued to launch heavy attacks on German positions and aircraft on Crete at the end of the week. On the 23rd, British heavy bombers raided Maleme airfield at night, destroying one large aircraft and causing a fire. The airfield had previously been attacked, with at least one German aircraft destroyed and several damaged. British fighter planes also attacked German troop transport aircraft in the Maleme area. In engagements between British aircraft and escorting German fighters, one British fighter plane was lost. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>London - According to the latest official news from Cairo, hand-to-hand combat on Crete continues. The Germans are continuing to send troops to the island by air, but on a smaller scale than in previous days. The area between Rethymno and Canea is particularly fierce. The Germans in that area have suffered heavy losses. German aircraft on the ground continue to be heavily shelled by British artillery, causing significant damage. At the same time, British bombers and long-range fighters are stepping up operations, destroying several German aircraft in the Maleme area. Since two Axis convoys were defeated by the British Navy last week, there have been no reports of the Germans attempting to land troops and heavy equipment on Crete by sea. However, it is believed that some fishing boats may be sneaking ashore. According to opinions in London, there are German-held islands within sixty miles of Crete, making it extremely difficult for the British Navy to prevent small groups of enemy soldiers from landing in small boats. However, it is generally believed that the Allied forces have control of the situation on the island. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>Greek King Arrives in Egypt, Encouraging Military and Civilians to Uphold Their Traditional Spirit, and Jointly Defend the Nation with Brave Allied Forces</h3>
<p>Cairo - It was officially announced that King George of Greece and the Greek government have left Crete for Egypt to avoid hindering military operations. After leaving the island, the King issued a proclamation to the military and civilians of Crete, encouraging them to uphold the traditional spirit of the Greek people's loyalty, courage, endurance, and sacrifice, to rally under the national flag, and to jointly defend the nation and strive for ultimate victory with brave Allied forces, and reaffirmed his belief in the final outcome. In this proclamation, the King explained his reasons for temporarily leaving Crete, stating that "One of the main objectives of the German paratroopers landing on Crete was the airfield near my residence and the Prime Minister's residence. The first wave of German paratroopers landed hundreds of yards from my residence and began fighting with the Allied forces. The enemy forces isolated us from our troops, and we had to withdraw to thwart the enemy's plan. After I went from my residence to the mountains, I consulted with those in charge and carefully studied the situation. To avoid hindering military plans, I decided to temporarily go to British territory at the invitation of the British government. This is the only way we can continue to perform our duties to benefit the nation." (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>Cairo - King George II of Greece broadcast a speech to the Greek people from here yesterday, saying that when German paratroopers landed on Crete, their first objective was to capture the Greek royal family. The first wave of paratroopers who landed on the island on May 20th were only a few hundred yards from the location of the King and the Greek Prime Minister and immediately engaged the Allied forces, and our communication with our troops was also cut off, making it necessary to relocate to prevent German conspiracies. It is reported that when the King escaped, he climbed over a mountain 7,000 feet high, pursued by German soldiers only 800 yards behind, and once hid in a mountain cave to avoid bombing by German aircraft overhead. Finally, he found a mule and, accompanied by two British officers, escaped to a coastal town. According to one of the two officers, Blackwood, speaking to a reporter from the United Press, many German paratroopers died when their parachutes failed to open during the jump. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Quiet Night Throughout Britain</p>
<p>London - Last night, there were no reports of enemy aircraft dropping bombs anywhere in Britain. The only place enemy aircraft were spotted was on the northeast coast, but there were no incidents.

<h3>British Aircraft Pursue German Warships in the North Atlantic, Searching a Vast Area of Over a Thousand Miles, One Torpedo Hit</h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty announced last night that British naval operations in the North Atlantic are still underway, aimed at forcing German warships into engagement. Since the battle on Saturday, after the British battlecruiser "Hood" exploded, German warships have been trying to evade pursuit by British ships. On that evening, British naval aircraft attacked and at least one torpedo hit a German warship. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>London - Well-informed sources say that the British Navy is still employing the historical tactics of the Battle of Matapan, using naval aircraft to launch torpedoes at the fleeing German fleet to prevent the escape of the German battleship "Bismarck" and other German warships. British naval aircraft are determined to seek revenge, searching the sea over a vast area of over a thousand miles, but the dense fog covering a large area of the North Atlantic, coupled with the darkness of night, is facilitating the escape of German warships. Naval experts point out that, apart from the new battleships "King George V" and "Prince of Wales," only the "Hood" had the capability to confront the "Bismarck" and "Tirpitz." Ships such as the "Renown" and "Repulse," although fast enough to pursue, lacked the firepower and armor to match these elite German warships. (United Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome - The Italian News Agency reports that the German fleet that sank the "Hood" off the coast of Greenland also sank one British auxiliary cruiser and two to three other ships, totaling 16,000 tons. (United Press, 26th)</p>

<h3>Lin Yutang Lectures in New York on the Strength of the Chinese Nation, Shanghai Restaurant's Charity Dinner Donates Ambulance, Chinese Aid Association's Event Draws Celebrities, Lin Lists Ten Key Factors in China's Victory</h3>
<p>Recently, overseas Chinese Feng Guoying and Zeng Lixian in New York opened a most modern restaurant, named "Shanghai Restaurant", in a newly built building opposite the Roxy Theatre. Out of a desire to serve the national cause, Feng and others contacted the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China and decided to donate all net income from the grand opening on April 22nd to the Bureau, in order to purchase a cargo-ambulance to send back to the motherland, for use in the war effort. The Bureau formed a special committee to handle this matter. After the meeting that night, Mrs. Xia Pingfang, wife of the President of the Bank of China, was elected to chair the program. Folksonson, editor of "Reader's Digest," was the banquet director, Dr. Xu Zhaodui, vice-chairman of the Chinese Aid Association, was the chairman of the conference, and Lin Yutang was the keynote speaker. Other attendees included writer Pearl Buck, Barnard College President Kidd Schlesinger, Song Ziang, Consul General Yu, Bank of China President Xia, New York Sun reporter Douglas, and writer Mina. One special feature of this dinner should be specifically mentioned: all guests, the chairman of the conference, and all staff paid for their meals, so that the income would be sufficient to purchase a vehicle.</p>
<p>Celebrities Attend, Unprecedented Success</p>
<p>At the opening of the meeting, Chairman Dr. Xu Zhaodui introduced celebrities Pearl Buck, Barnard College President Kidd Schlesinger, "Reader's Digest" editor Dr. Folksonson, and Consul General Yu. Chairman Xu said that since the war, the Chinese aid movement in the United States has relied heavily on the promotion of Consul General Yu. The establishment of the United Chinese Aid Association of America is also the result of Consul General Yu's efforts. Therefore, he gave a warm introduction to Consul General Yu. After Chairman Xu finished speaking, "Reader's Digest" editor Dr. Folkson presided over the meeting. Then Mr. Lin Yutang began his speech. Finally, Dr. Folksonson reported that the income from the dinner and the donations from the guests were sufficient to purchase a vehicle.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Yutang's Speech is Insightful</p>
<p>The full text of Mr. Lin Yutang's speech is as follows: The most mysterious event in modern history is the current war between China and Japan. Although the Chinese people have suffered unimaginable pain, their great spirit remains the same, which is beyond the imagination of the world. At the beginning of the war, I said that this war was a war between long-range artillery and eternal philosophy, and the result would be a stalemate. Judging from the current situation, philosophy seems to be winning over artillery.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Character is Strong and Unyielding</p>
<p>In today's world, the Axis powers are brutal and tyrannical, believing that only force can achieve ultimate victory. However, democratic countries rely on the supreme spirit of fearlessness of mankind as the most effective weapon to overcome power. Frankly speaking, what we can hope for in the ultimate victory of Britain is the strong and unyielding character of the British people. As for the Chinese people, they are often considered not to possess this characteristic. However, the results of the war in China today are sufficient to show what a great national character of strength and unyieldingness can achieve. This can not only break past misunderstandings, but also be regarded as our greatest lesson. Although the Chinese people usually value courtesy, they are currently strong and unyielding.</p>
<p>Fighting While Building the Nation</p>
<p>China's final victory can now be asserted, but few people know the reasons for the current situation. Please allow me to explain. I believe that this war can achieve mysterious effects because it is fighting while building the nation. Recently, someone who visited Chongqing said that Chongqing is constantly building and improving, seemingly unaware of the possibility of air raids this summer, as if the war has ended. The entire country is busy with reconstruction. Last summer, I also saw people digging tunnels and building roads under air raids. Last winter, a new national library was completed, and a large theater that can accommodate thousands of people was added. As the saying goes, "If you don't advance, you retreat." If China had not advanced, developed the interior, and made it the base of operations, I am afraid that China would have been completely unable to resist. Therefore, building the nation is one of the tactics of warfare. Understanding this can help us understand why China's war strength is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Factors of Victory, Ten Key Points</p>
<p>China's victory today is due to the unanimous support of the heroic leader Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek by the entire nation, and the continuous implementation of the original strategy. The factors are as follows: (1) The people of the whole country can be sincerely united and fight together. Not a single general has been tempted to surrender. (2) Millions of people would rather abandon their homes and flee to the interior, not complaining to the government due to hunger and cold. (3) All soldiers are brave. (4) Because the government and leaders are all diligent officials and serve the people, they have won their trust. Therefore, the people can endure the pain and wait for the final victory, and the soldiers can bravely fight without fear of death. (5) The development of the interior, the construction of roads, the relocation of factories and schools, etc., are all unavoidable facts, and all can be done one by one, which is quite difficult. (6) Not only has the original army not been scattered, but the new army being trained is increasing day by day. (7) In the guerrilla areas, the government has left a large number of guerrillas and regular national troops to carry out extremely effective sabotage work. (8) In the midst of vast destruction, a new era of Chinese construction has been created. (9) Thanks to God, all four years have been bountiful harvests. (10) The Yellow River has not frozen for three years, which has prevented the Japanese army from advancing, which is also very important.</p>
<p>Great Strength Defeats Weapons</p>
<p>In short, the realization of China's war strategy relies not only on the common vision of the leaders, but also on the great achievements of the people's ability to endure adversity and work hard. Take the world-famous Burma Road as an example. The completion of this road is considered by the world to be an artificial miracle. If the road could not have been completed by human effort, or had not been built in time, then China would have been in what situation? Fortunately, the road has been completed and opened to traffic two months after the fall of Wuhan, which proves the government's vision and the people's great strength in hard work. If objective historians, who must base everything on objective conditions, are to consider the matter, then China must have been predicted to fail. But China has succeeded, which shows that objective conditions (weapons) are sometimes no match for subjective fearlessness and perseverance. Now, Britain's equipment may be inferior to Germany's, but Britain has a spirit of fortitude and perseverance, so Britain will be able to achieve ultimate victory like China.</p>
<p>American Transport Ship "Hunter Liggett" Returns Home Yesterday, Carrying Over Three Hundred American Soldiers</p>
<p>The American naval transport ship "Hunter Liggett," carrying 224 American Marines whose service in Shanghai had expired, set sail from the mooring at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 26th) to return to the United States. The ship arrived in Shanghai last Friday (the 20th), carrying 150 replacement American soldiers. Although this number is less than half of the number of returning American soldiers, all sectors of the city are not paying much attention to it.</p>
<p>Dutch Ships Still Sail to the Far East, Not Discontinuing Service</p>
<p>According to a report yesterday by a Pingming News Agency reporter, it was learned from the shipping industry that the Dutch Royal Rotterdam Lloyd steamships that have temporarily suspended service are the "Tegelberg," "Boschfontein," and "Ruys." However, Dutch ships sailing on the Far East route will not be interrupted as a result. Other Dutch ships will join and continue to sail. It is also reported that the company's steamship "Le Maire" is scheduled to arrive today.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Stillwell: Impressions of a Trip Around the South China Sea: British, Dutch, and Australian Forces Have Established Strong Defenses; Chinese Morale is High and Cannot Be Threatened</h3>
<p>American *Chicago Daily News* Far East correspondent Stillwell traveled to various places in the South Pacific and China at the beginning of this year. He first went from Shanghai to Hong Kong, via Singapore and the East Indies, then to Thailand. From Bangkok, he traveled overland to Rangoon, then via the Burma Road to Kunming and Chongqing. After four months, he recently returned from Chongqing to Hong Kong by plane, and from Hong Kong he took a boat back to Shanghai. Yesterday, he told reporters that although there is no formal alliance between the Dutch East Indies and Great Britain, the two sides have close cooperation. The people in various places in the South China Sea are deeply convinced that should the Dutch East Indies or British territories in the Pacific become involved in war, they will immediately provide each other with all possible assistance.</p>
<p>Surabaya Naval Forces Greatly Strengthened</p>
<p>Stillwell said that the defenses of Singapore and Malaya have doubled compared to a year ago, and the same is true in the Dutch East Indies. When the Netherlands fell, the local people were very discouraged, but now they are very excited. They also know that American planes often come to the Dutch East Indies because they have bases both at sea and on land. They are also now building "mosquito boats." The naval base near Surabaya has also been greatly strengthened recently. The local people feel they have an excellent military position to resist foreign aggression. The islands surrounding Java can serve as excellent barriers, and the population of each island is more sparse than that of Java. The Dutch and British there feel that the entire South China Sea area is closely related to each other and cannot be separated. The entire defense line extends from Singapore southward through the Dutch East Indies to Darwin Harbor in Australia. The Australian part is particularly important, as Australia is the British armory in the Far East. Aviation links in various areas of the South China Sea have also greatly improved. During the continuation of the war, the air route from the United States via Australia to the Dutch East Indies will become even more important.</p>
<p>Chongqing and Kunming Are Not Afraid of Air Raids</p>
<p>What Stillwell saw in Burma was the same as in other places: they are now actively setting up defenses. It is said that most of the new Burmese army are Indians. Kunming is very active. Although Japanese planes sometimes bomb the city, it has no impact on morale. Local residents are now changing their work hours, from 3:00 PM to midnight. They no longer work during the day. Everything in Chongqing is as usual. It is believed that Japanese air raids on Chongqing will definitely not resolve the war. As the effectiveness of air defense equipment continues to increase, bombing is also powerless. All the cars and movable property of the people can be moved, in part or in whole, to basements, so they will not be damaged by bombing.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Rice Should be Protected Against Smuggling</p>
<p>The Yuanshengxiang Rice Store at No. 56 Annam Road in the International Settlement purchased 25 bags of low-priced Hong Kong rice from the Tai Run Grain Store for sale. Unexpectedly, last Saturday (the 24th) at 2:00 PM, a detective discovered that the low-priced Hong Kong rice sold by the store was slightly different. According to information reported to the Shanghai Municipal Council, a special detective, Yang Shiquan, was dispatched to the store yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to investigate. According to a Mr. Li in the store, there was no adulteration, but the quality was slightly inferior. The detective took a small sample of rice from each of the ten or so bags of rice in the store and brought them back to the police station for detailed investigation before taking further action.</p>
<p>Collecting Low-Quality Rice to Smuggle Out of the Country</p>
<p>Recently, a certain firm has been specializing in collecting 30,000 bags of low-quality rice from the "De**" ship about to arrive at the port, attempting to transport them to Fujian and Macau. Some people even mixed No. 1 and No. 2 broken rice to impersonate No. 4 rice grits, obtaining removal permits from the authorities and transporting them to Wuxi and Hangzhou to seek huge profits. This is extremely illegal. It is hoped that the authorities of the two settlements will pay close attention to this.</p>
<p>Negotiations Still Underway for the Wholesale Price of Rice</p>
<p>According to rice industry sources, the French Municipal Council's tribute rice is being shipped to Shanghai for sale. Grain stores are now sending representatives to negotiate with the Council on the issue of sales profits. According to rice industry insiders, the current wholesale price of low-priced Hong Kong rice from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement to grain stores is 122.91 yuan per bag, and the selling price to rice stores is 133.50 yuan, resulting in a profit of 8.5%. Now, the French Municipal Council is only willing to give a profit of 8%, which is actually less than that of the International Settlement, so the two sides have not yet reached an agreement.</p>
<p>The Root Cause of Rising Pork Prices</p>
<p>The source of pigs in this port is extremely scarce recently due to government controls, and the prices in the producing areas are high, with overlapping transportation costs and miscellaneous taxes, resulting in soaring fresh meat prices, reaching three yuan per catty, still without supply to meet demand. The market is privately distributed by brokers, disregarding the capital of vendors and arbitrarily lowering prices for sale and raising prices, taking profits from it. It is difficult for meat prices to rise, and pig vendors still need to use long sticks, with many going to other ports to do business. Before the war, the meat industry usually purchased live pigs from pig farms and sent them to slaughterhouses for slaughter, then sold white meat. However, now everything is manipulated. Many so-called brokers are disguised meat merchants, supplying the goods they receive to their own stores for sale. There are also those who are nominally pig farms, but actually do not sell live pigs to meat merchants, but slaughter the pigs themselves and retail the white meat to meat merchants (what meat vendors commonly call "hanging meat"). Therefore, small meat merchants cannot purchase live pigs for slaughter themselves. After layers of exploitation, meat prices have soared, creating a meat shortage phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Jinan Steamer Encountered Gale and Accidentally Steered Off Course and Hit a Reef; Fortunately, the Forecastle Was Lodged on the Reef Tip and Did Not Sink; Passengers Were Transferred Back to Shanghai by the Suzhou Steamer</h3>
<p>The Jinan, a regular ship on the South China Line of the British Taikoo Shipping Company, with a deadweight of over 2,100 tons, loaded passengers and cargo in Shanghai at 11:00 AM last Friday (the 23rd) and set sail directly for Hong Kong. At about 9:00 PM that night, it sailed near the Zhoushan Islands. At that time, there was a thunderstorm and wind and waves, and the driver lost control and accidentally steered off course, hitting a hidden reef.</p>
<p>The Forecastle Was Punctured</p>
<p>Sea water poured in, but fortunately the forecastle was lodged on the reef tip, and there was no danger of sinking, but the ship could not move. The ship sent a telegram for help immediately after the accident. The company received the telegram and hired two large tugboats from Moller &amp; Codrington the next morning (the 24th), dispatching more than 30 workers to prepare to unload the cargo from the Jinan. On the one hand, the company telegraphed the Suzhou ship, which was on its way from Hong Kong to Shanghai, to go to the scene of the accident and pick up the passengers of the Jinan. The Suzhou ship arrived in port at about 4:00 PM yesterday, and all of the more than 110 passengers of the Jinan ship were</p>
<p>Safely Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the passengers of the Jinan, they were terrified when the Jinan ship had the accident, but after learning that the ship would not sink on the reef, they were all relieved. Currently, the bow of the ship is raised high, and the two large tugboats dispatched by the company are unloading the cargo, waiting for the ship to float up after the cargo is unloaded, and then drag it out of danger. The sea water in the cabin will also be pumped out, and the punctured area will be repaired. It will still need to return to Shanghai for repairs. It is said that the passengers and crew of the ship were safe and sound, and there was no loss of luggage or items. However, some of the vegetables and foreign potatoes loaded in the forecastle were thrown into the sea in order to lighten the ship's body to make it float. According to the company, the passengers of the Jinan ship returning to Shanghai can exchange their tickets for passage on other ships, or they can return their tickets for a refund.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Regular Meeting This Week</p>
<p>The regular meeting of the Shanghai Rotary Club this week is scheduled for noon on Thursday, May 29th, at the Doughty Hotel. At that time, Bishop Ward of the Central China Church will give a lecture on "Memoirs of a Member's Excursion." This topic is very interesting for members traveling in the interior, as he himself has accumulated rich experience from traveling in the interior for four years. All members from this city and other places who wish to invite guests to attend are requested to call the Club Secretary (16450) to reserve seats.</p>
<p>The Iron Gates of the French Concession Were Still Closed Yesterday; Someone Climbed Over the Wall to Enter the Nanshi; The Policeman Opened Fire, Fortunately Not Hitting Anyone</p>
<p>The iron gates connecting the French Concession and the Nanshi were closed after Kikuji Kabashima, the captain of the Japanese Gendarmerie, was shot in the Old Warehouse Street of Nanshi on the 24th. They have not been opened until yesterday. The residents who were blocked were standing inside and outside the iron gates, looking very hesitant. According to a *Datong News Agency* reporter who visited the iron gates yesterday morning, there was no trace of anyone on the Minquan Road of Nanshi, and the scene was desolate. Some Nanshi residents waiting outside the iron gates were especially pitiful because of the sudden cold weather.</p>
<p>The Policeman Opened Fire and Was Reprimanded on the Spot</p>
<p>According to a *Datong News Agency* reporter, at 1:00 PM on the previous day (the 24th), at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Caishi Road, Kunming and the Chinese boundary, due to the traffic blockade, some Nanshi residents in the concession could not pass, so they climbed over the low wall in the hope of entering. A policeman standing there suddenly fired a shot at the residents climbing over the low wall, fortunately not hitting anyone. Another French policeman came forward, took the bullets from the policeman's gun, and reprimanded him for his reckless shooting.</p>
<h3>Stock Broker Liu Jianwu Was Kidnapped and Escaped; Three Arrested Criminals Were All Western-Suited Youths; They Confessed That the Idea Was Conceived by a Man Named Ni Guozhang</h3>
<p>Liu Jianwu, a Hunanese who works as a stock broker, usually drives his own car, No. 1317. At 11:50 PM on the 24th of this month, Liu was on his way home from a friend's place in the Xiudexincun on Chengdu Road, and as he was about to start the car, he was suddenly threatened by three kidnappers with guns. Liu was tied up and put into a hired car, No. 12119, from the Tailai Motor Company, and driven to Room 10 in Apartment No. 24, Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, to be guarded. A letter was sent to his family, intending to</p>
<p>Extort a Huge Sum of Money</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at 1:00 PM the next day, the 25th, the kidnappers guarding him were all taking a nap. In a moment, loud snores were heard. Liu took the opportunity to escape and ran to the alley entrance, reporting to Chinese policeman No. 645, who in turn reported to several Chinese policemen stationed in front of the Bank of Communications nearby, who rushed to surround the place. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and Chief Western Detective Kaoxindeng, Deputy Chief Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanjing, Detective Yang Fusheng, and Detective Yan Bingheng were specially dispatched to rush into Room 10 of No. 24, but it was already empty. Only</p>
<p>A Pistol Was Seized</p>
<p>One pistol and six bullets were seized. Then, in the apartment next door, No. 26, the kidnappers Huang Ziping, from Taicang, Jiang Xinkang, from Ningbo, and He Wenting, a local, were arrested. They were all wearing Western suits and were in their thirties. In Room 34 of No. 26, another pistol and six bullets were seized and taken to the police station for detention. The victim was escorted home. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law and described the above situation in detail. Then, the victim, Liu Jianwu, testified</p>
<p>About the Circumstances of His Escape</p>
<p>And stated that Huang Ziping was often present during the kidnapping, Jiang Xinkang was in charge of guarding him, and He Wenting had been there yesterday, urging him to write a letter, etc. When questioned, the defendants confessed to the charges, but all said they were instructed by the escaped Ni Guozhang. After verifying the confessions, the three defendants were ordered to be detained and the case was adjourned to the 4th of next month for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Sir Lytton Believes Deeply That China Will Never Be Conquered</h3>
<p>The *China Press* published an article yesterday by Sir Lytton of England, which stated: In March of this year, President Roosevelt stated in his worldwide radio broadcast that China and the United Kingdom should both be beneficiaries of the American Lend-Lease Act and enjoy the assistance that the United States can provide to carry out their heroic war against Japan. We must know that China has been engaged in continuous warfare for nearly ten years. During this period, it has never received foreign aid, but has been able to fight independently. Its purpose of fighting is no different from our purpose of being forced to defend equality, freedom, and justice with arms seven years later.</p>
<p>China Will Never Be Conquered</p>
<p>China has witnessed its country being invaded, its people being massacred, and its cities being bombed, without the means of defense or retaliation. Suppose that the young pilots of our (British) Royal Air Force, despite their talents and experience, had no machines to resist German bombers, and suppose that we had no sufficient anti-aircraft guns to resist enemy air raids, what would be our misfortune? However, China's experience is indeed the same. Although its equipment is poor, its fighting spirit has remained the same for several years, and its courage in battle has increased unabated. Today, China is more unconquerable than at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>Deeply Regret Not Providing Assistance Back Then</p>
<p>If we had been able to provide China with assistance in 1932, we would not have witnessed the rise of Hitlerism in Germany; nor would we have witnessed the war spreading to Africa and Europe. China has always encouraged itself with patience and never complained. China knows our difficulties and weaknesses, so it is satisfied with only our empty sympathy. But the current situation is very different. We have promised material assistance and guaranteed that it will be delivered, and China is fighting with this new hope. We must know that Britain is now fighting for freedom and for upholding world justice, but this war for freedom and justice began as early as 1931 when the Japanese army invaded Shenyang.</p>
<p>Others Followed Suit, Leaving Trouble for Today</p>
<p>The only benefit of the European War from 1914 to 1918, which sacrificed countless lives, was to establish a worldwide organization to prevent the recurrence of aggression. This is a lifeline of civilization, also the "new order" exchanged for the blood of millions of people. Japan was originally one of the strong countries and an important trustee of the "new order." Unexpectedly, it willingly became the leader of the rebels and first destroyed this "new order." As a result, other countries had an example to follow and followed suit, creating the chaotic situation in the world today. If we want to build a true "new order" in the future, we must not forget who first destroyed the order and who first maintained the order?</p>
<p>Who First Initiated the Act of Aggression</p>
<p>In fact, every action and method taken by Germany and Italy in Europe today was first initiated by Japan in Asia. Launching troops without a declaration of war, yet calling it peace, preparing for hostility while ostensibly being friendly, inciting disturbances in neighboring countries to create an excuse for armed intervention, while calling it restoring order, occupying the territories of others and claiming to have no territorial ambitions—in all of these things, Japan can be called the earliest inventor.</p>
<p>Will Surely Tread the Path of Napoleon</p>
<p>After the war, its spirit has not been deterred. Although China has suffered great sacrifices, the unity of its people is unprecedented in its history. Japan has created Chinese nationalism, just as Napoleon created European nationalism. Napoleon was destroyed by the European nationalism he created, so those who deal with Japan must also deal with Chinese nationalism. The war in the Far East was the starting point for the war in Europe today, so to end the European war, we must first resolve the conflict in the Far East in a fair and permanent way.</p>
<p>The Arrival of Light Is Not Far Away</p>
<p>The Japanese have studied the situation in Europe and the United States extensively. When other countries in the world were only busy with economic and political crises and had no time to look to the East, Japan took the opportunity to take aggressive actions against China, so that other countries could not intervene. But the Chinese people deeply believe that China will never be conquered by Japan. On the contrary, Japan is very worried about the development of the United States and Japan. When the war for freedom in Europe is won, it will be the day of reckoning in Asia. The grievances suffered by Abyssinia have been redressed, and the day of China's revenge is not far away.</p>

<h3>Letter from the British Tramway Company: Stating the Cause of the Tram Fire; Proving that Passengers Carried Explosives Caused the Disaster; The Company Expresses Deep Sympathy for the Deceased and Injured</h3>
<p>A letter from the British Tramway Company of the International Settlement stated: Sir, regarding the fire on a trolleybus on May 19, there are many rumors in the outside world. The truth is hereby announced as follows: The bus was traveling south on Carter Road, and when it passed Shanhaiguan Road, the third-class carriage suddenly exploded. The cause is unknown, leading to a fire that quickly spread to the first-class carriage. However, the burning time was very short, estimated to be no more than three or four minutes, before it was extinguished. The passengers were in chaos, and the employees on the bus tried to maintain order but failed. Two employees were slightly injured, and some passengers were also burned, including some who died in the hospital due to serious injuries. After the incident, the company immediately handed the bus over to the Shanghai Municipal Council for inspection, which confirmed that the explosion and fire were not caused by any electrical current or other faulty equipment on the bus, and had absolutely no relationship with the engine parts of the bus. The investigation is currently underway. Judging from various signs, someone brought explosives or flammable materials into the bus at the time, causing this disaster. The identity of the person who brought this item is still unknown. The company is deeply saddened by this incident and expresses its deep sympathy to the families of the deceased and the injured. Sincerely, Shanghai Electric Tramways Limited, May 26.</p>
<p>Strange Guests Suddenly Came to the Home of the Court's Dispatch Director; Instructed Him to Go to a Certain Place; The Couple Took the Opportunity to Slip Away</p>
<p>Pan Yanyu, the director of the dispatch office of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, lives at No. 5, Heng'an Lane, Sihames Road, French Concession, next to the Gao** Branch of the court. His wife, Lu Fujuan, is the niece of Lu Yimei, the former president of the local court, and also works in the execution office of the First Special District Court. At 11:30 PM on the night before last (the 24th), three uninvited guests suddenly came to visit, wanting to invite Mr. and Mrs. Pan to talk at a certain place. The Pan couple had been living in the court recently, and happened to be home that night. They had already turned off the lights and were fast asleep. Hearing the sound, Lu Fujuan got up and talked to the guests, instructing them to wait a moment so that they could get dressed and go with them. Then, they took the opportunity to slip out through the back door with her husband. The guests waited for a long time without seeing any trace of Mr. and Mrs. Lu, so they left together.</p>
<p>A Trolleybus Ran Over and Killed Someone; Tried to Avoid It but Was Too Late; Crashed into a Coffin Shop</p>
<p>Trolleybus No. 327 of the British Company, Route 17, travels between the Sichuan Road Bridge and the Dapu Bridge in the French Concession. At 3:30 PM yesterday, the driver, Xu Jinyu, No. 30, was driving from east to west, and when he was driving to the intersection of Conti Road and Malang Road in the French Concession, Song Caifu, a 24-year-old old clerk of the Tianyi Dyeing Factory at No. 10 Malang Road Nanshan Road, was riding a bicycle across the road. Xu was unable to brake in time and knocked Song down in the middle of the road, causing him to be injured and die. Because he wanted to avoid it, the trolleybus crashed the front of the car into a coffin shop set up by Wang Da at No. 728 on the north side, and the doors, windows, and coffins were damaged. The nearby Lujiabang Police Station heard the news and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to take care of the scene, and investigated the facts to report for verification.</p>
<h3>Bomb Explosion Case: Three People Died; A Woman Brought Back an Iron Can; Cohabiting to Watch Caused the Disaster; The Mother and Daughter of the Tenant Did Not Return</h3>
<p>In the back building on the second floor of the Huifeng Cigarette Paper Store at No. 32 Lagenar Road, French Concession, a Ningbo woman, Lu Yu, 32 years old, suddenly had a bomb explosion in her room at 9:30 PM the night before last, injuring six people, including women and children. The general situation was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned from the police station that Yu has a daughter, Lu Suzhen, 15 years old, who brought back an iron can from outside on the morning before yesterday. It is said that a relative gave her candy, so she brought it back and placed it on the table. When Yu and her daughter went out to eat supper at a relative's place in the evening, someone living in the same room suddenly became curious and opened the iron can to look at it, causing it to explode. Until now, Yu and her daughter have not returned home, so the origin of this bomb is still unknown. It is now known that the women who were injured on the spot, Lin Shao, 33 years old, the girl, Shao Abao, 12 years old, and Zhang Chen, 47 years old, were all from Ningbo. All three died from their injuries before they could be treated. Their bodies were transported to the Tongren Fuyuantang morgue for autopsy, and then their families came to the scene to collect them. Yesterday, two buses in the International Settlement and the French Concession were robbed. Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, a bus on Route 1 was carrying passengers and traveling near Jing'an Temple Road and Hartung Road. Suddenly, several robbers in the bus took out guns and robbed a passenger sitting next to them, stealing more than 120 yuan in cash before fleeing. At 2:45 PM, a bus on Route 22, No. 850, of the French Company in the French Concession was passing near Foch Road and Chengdu Road, when four robbers in the bus suddenly threatened passengers with guns, robbed all the passengers, and then forced the ticket seller and bell ringer of No. 237 to stop the bus. Then, the four robbers got off the bus and fled in different directions. Two of the four robbers were wearing Western suits and two were wearing Chinese suits, and they were carrying a pistol.</p>

<h3>Business News Finance, Japanese Merchants Sold US Dollars Forcefully in the Afternoon. The Exchange Market Initially Stabilized Then Eased Further.</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC quoted prices, various exchange rates did not change. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was in a stagnant state, then suddenly became looser. Trading was very light, as speculators were quietly waiting for the US President's fireside chat tonight. Chinese merchants still had short positions of around 1.5 million yuan in this month's forward exchange. It briefly resisted, reaching 5.4625 yuan. At noon, it briefly struggled. Then, rumors of a US-German conflict emerged, and it soon returned to its previous level. The afternoon was mostly stable. After 3:30 PM, Japanese Mitsui suddenly started selling. Foreign merchants also actively closed out their positions, and the market trended downwards. In the end, British exchange closed at 0.15625, and US exchange at 0.3125. It is rumored that speculators have short positions of around 7 million yuan in June US dollars.</p>
<p>The Opening Was Quite Relaxed</p>
<p>Since this morning, foreign cables reported that the British, American, and Indian silver markets were closed for holidays. Exchange rates in various countries saw the US dollar rise 25 against the British pound and slightly lower one cent against the Shanghai dollar, with the rest remaining stable. The central bank's listed exchange rates did not change. The opening prices of the domestic market were as follows: spot British exchange at 3 pence and 3125, and US dollars at 5.40625 yuan, both unchanged. There were few changes later. HSBC's listed exchange rates did not change. The silver equalization tax remained at 23.75%. Later, Chinese merchant speculators bought into May US dollars at 5.40625 yuan. Chinese and foreign merchant banks were willing to supply at the above prices, so the rally soon stopped and the market became stagnant at noon. In the afternoon, both exchange rates were the same as the opening prices in the morning.</p>
<p>Sudden Shift in the Afternoon Market</p>
<p>The afternoon started with a stagnant market. Speculators and Chinese and foreign merchant banks had little supply or demand. Until 3:30 PM, it was suddenly reported that Mitsui was selling May US dollars for June delivery at 5.4375 yuan. Other foreign merchant banks also supplied at the above prices, and the market trended downwards. The market closed at 4:00 PM with spot and June British exchange at 3 pence and 328125, and US dollars at 5.4375 yuan, which was an increase of 0.15625 for the British and 0.3125 for the US compared to the closing prices last Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 16th (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened steady this morning. British, American, and Japanese exchange rates remained unchanged. The forward US dollar opened at 24.4375 yuan. The Shanghai dollar spot rate decreased by 2.5 jiao, to 450.25 yuan.</p>

<p>British and American Exchange Rates Both Increased in Tianjin</p>
<p>Tianjin, 26th (Monday) dispatch: The exchange market opened lower this morning. London and New York telegraphic transfers both increased by 0.3125.

<p>A Sudden Selling Spree in the Evening, Sharp Decline in the Gold Market</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market in the black market continued to be stagnant and weak. As everyone expected the US President's fireside chat tonight, and there were fears that tensions between the US and Germany would escalate, people were already nervous and exhausted. Later, it was reported that Japanese merchant banks were aggressively selling US dollars, causing a sudden downward trend. Therefore, in the half-hour before the evening closing, the decline accelerated. Initially, although Deutsche Bank, Shih Ho, Qing Tai Yong, and retail investors were continuously selling, the foreign exchange market was stable. This month's US dollar slightly softened due to speculators covering their short positions. Cheng Kee and Teh Cheng actively bought, and the market momentum briefly turned from weak to strong at noon, rising to 6,399 yuan. At that time, rumors of a US-German conflict emerged, hindering the rise. There were few changes in the early afternoon. However, the market had already shown signs of weakening amid stability. After 3:30 PM, the foreign exchange market weakened, and securities firms such as Yi Da and Qian Dui Ye Shun Yuan actively sold, triggering a downward trend. The price sharply fell to 6,365 yuan, and finally closed 31 yuan lower. The total trading volume for the day was 15,600 taels. The trading volume of swaps (May rolled into June) was small. The seller paid the buyer 75 yuan in cash. Yong Feng Yu sold 90 taels to Fang Jiu Xia and Bao Cheng Gong Ji, priced 335 yuan higher than the forward price. In the afternoon, Yong Feng Yu sold 100 taels to Xiang He, priced 325 yuan higher. Chi Da sold 130 taels to Deutsche Bank, priced 335 yuan higher, which was 30 yuan lower than last Saturday. Ornamental gold was down 5 yuan, at 690 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Futures Fell by 31 Yuan</p>
<p>The market opened at 9:15 AM at 6,390 yuan per bar (10 taels), which was 9 yuan lower than last Saturday's noon closing price. Gong He Jin raised the price to 6,395 yuan. Deutsche Bank, Ju Feng Yong, and Shih Ho sold, and the price retreated to 6,380 yuan. Hong Qing Yong retail investors bought, and the price rose to 6,394 yuan. Later, the fluctuations became narrower. Near noon, Qing Tai, Deutsche Bank, Ren Cheng Yong sold, and the price fell to 6,378 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that this month's US dollar at 5.40625 yuan was difficult to settle. Under the momentum of Cheng Kee and Teh Cheng, the price soared to 6,399 yuan. Xin Feng Yong sold, causing a slight setback. The noon closing price was 6,393 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM at 6,394 yuan, then briefly saw 6,395 yuan. Shun Yuan and retail investors sold, fluctuating around 6,385 yuan for as long as 1.5 hours. Until 3:30 PM, the US dollar weakened. Yi Da, Ren Cheng, and Yong also sold, immediately causing a drop of 20 yuan, falling to 6,365 yuan. Xin Feng Yong rose to 6,370 yuan. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 6,369 yuan, 31 yuan lower than last Saturday. According to the settlement price of June US dollars at 5.4375 yuan, the price was 6,404.6 yuan, a premium of 35.6 yuan. The price fluctuated by 34 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of standard gold in the cash market was 350 yuan higher than the black market forward price, and the purchase price was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot margin.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Was Listed 5 Yuan Lower</p>
<p>The price of jewelry gold per tael was listed at 695 yuan by Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang. At 4:00 PM, it fell by 5 yuan, to 690 yuan. The buying and selling spread was reduced by 40 yuan.</p>
<p>The US Dollar Fell the Most – Closing at the Day's Lowest Price</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The black market price trended downward. British and American gold pounds also fell by one yuan each. British gold notes remained stagnant, and the market price remained stable. US gold notes closed at the day's lowest price of 18.07 yuan, which was 1.2 jiao lower than last week. Hong Kong notes also trended softer. Japanese and Korean gold notes both trended lower. The former had retreated to 1 yuan, and the latter had fallen to 1.7 jiao.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Five-Spice Vegetables Reached a New High Price</p>
<p>Five-spice vegetables have been in short supply for a long time, and the market stock is extremely tight. Recently, 40 pieces were shipped by Japanese ships. The quality of the goods is very good. Because of the shortage of goods, the price is persistently firm. Yesterday, the asking price had risen to 140 yuan, which is an unprecedented new high price. Further tightening is expected.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary: Feng Liu</p>
<h3>Banks (4)</h3>
<p>At that time, the Ministry of Revenue requested the establishment of a bank on February 13th (Guangxu 30th year), with a capital of four million taels of gold. The Ministry of Revenue was responsible for raising half of the funds, and the remaining two million taels were to be raised from merchants in the form of shares, with a monthly interest rate of six percent (i.e., as the capital for establishing the Ministry of Revenue Bank). However, due to the issuance of banknotes during the Xianfeng era and the holding of Zhaoxin shares during the Guangxu 25th year, the government failed to gain the trust of the people. Merchants became increasingly suspicious, and upon hearing that it was government-run, they frowned and regarded it as a dangerous path. Therefore, Jiang Shiheng's father said, "Why not order Prince Qing to withdraw the funds from HSBC and allocate them to the government-run bank as shares, so that the capital can be easily raised and the bank can be quickly established? And increase the monthly interest rate from two percent to six percent, which would greatly benefit Prince Qing's private property, and merchants would dispel their suspicions and actively join in."</p>
<p>The memorial was accepted, and Lu Chuanlin was sent to HSBC to investigate thoroughly. The bank's general manager, Hee Lear, and compradore, Yang Shaowo, refused the investigation, claiming that "the bank's regulations prohibit informing anyone about customer deposits, and account statements are also not allowed to be shown to anyone." Therefore, the investigation yielded no results. As a result, Jiang Shiheng was punished and removed from his position as censor, and transferred to his original yamen.</p>
<p>This shows that many officials hid their wealth in foreign banks. Therefore, even if Empress Dowager Cixi had not done this, it is possible that members of the royal family and nobles had done so. Moreover, at that time, various foreign banks established branches in Beijing, and their only business was to absorb the private savings of officials as interest-free deposits, and then lend them to the Qing government to expand their influence in China. The Russo-Chinese Bank was looted during the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year (1900 AD). The rebels envied HSBC's large amount of silver and attempted to rob it, but failed. At the time, people wrote poems about this event, saying:</p>
<p>"The Russo-Chinese Bank went west, HSBC stored its wealth. Millions of taels of snow-white silver were hoarded. They wanted to make a fortune from foreigners like ants, Chongwen's gate connected directly to Zheng Yang's gate."</p>
<p>Since the Banque de France merged with the Russo-Chinese Bank, France no longer had a bank in China. Moreover, at that time, the Qing government's military expenditures and reparations were huge, and there was no way to increase revenue. They often used road and mine industries to borrow money from foreign merchants. The amount of loans guaranteed was huge, the benefits were high, the conditions were harsh, and the commissions were generous, unparalleled in the world. France could not remain unmoved. Therefore, they endowed the Banque de l'Indochine, which they jointly operated in the Annam colony, with special privileges, established a branch in Shanghai. It was established in the Guangxu 14th year (1898 AD, the bank's head office was established in Paris in 1875 AD), with a capital of one million taels of silver, and opened a branch in Shanghai, which is the Banque de l'Indochine. Soon, it was making profits, and branches were established throughout the north and south. It was first located on the west side of Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road, then moved to the Bund of the French Concession, the current site of the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, and then moved to its current site, the former site of the Banque de France.

<h3>Food: Plans to Export Shanghai Rice, Rice Weevils and Speculators are Elated. Fortunately, the Sale of Rice by the Two Concessions Never Stops</h3>
<p>Yesterday, speculators were active in the foreign rice market, and the market suddenly showed a prosperous and thriving atmosphere. Both futures and spot goods rose in unison. Speculators and manipulators are also trying to make a comeback, taking advantage of the recent domestic sales of foreign rice to Ningbo and Shaoxing, and the expanded official reports of Japanese merchants transporting rice. The "leather ball gang" and "hat gang" are even more active in secret. Therefore, after the opening prices in the early market, various high-grade foreign rice and Yinghua Company's futures all rose in unison. As a result, all rose by 13 yuan compared to last Saturday. Although it was prohibited in the afternoon, people's sentiments were still excited. However, Hong Kong rice is arriving in Shanghai continuously. In addition to the third batch having arrived in Shanghai and awaiting sale, the fourth and fifth batches have also been arranged to be shipped. Moreover, the French Municipal Council's sale of Vietnamese rice also has 50,000 bags already arrived in Shanghai, which will be sold on the 1st. Its selling price and all procedures will be handled publicly in accordance with the precedents of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. Its merits of benefiting citizens and stabilizing the rice market are very great. Although speculators and manipulators are trying to be active, it is feared that they may not be able to sell their manipulation. Transactions were particularly focused on Xiaowen and Mindang rice. The actual sales on the street were also strong for medium-grade goods such as No. 2 Saigon and Siam rice. New speculators and general retail investors made waves from the middle. Prices rose all the way. No. 1 Saigon opened at 119 yuan to 120 yuan, No. 2 reached 115 yuan, No. 2 Siam 112 yuan, Xiaowen 114 yuan, Mindang rice jumped from 114 yuan to 118 yuan, Shenjing round white rice 109 yuan, secondary 104.5 yuan, broken rice 91.2 yuan. Overall, although the above prices are all higher than the week before, there are many differences, ranging from 12 yuan to 34 yuan. This is because the destinations of each type of goods are different, resulting in some differences. Yinghua Company Xiaowen 1367 yuan, No. 1 Saigon 143.5 yuan to 144.5 yuan, broken rice 103 yuan to 105 yuan. The total volume of spot rice traded throughout the day was 25,600 bags, and Yinghua Company traded 1,5600 tons.</p>
<p>The national rice such as Thick, Thin and Japonica rice, because of the temporary market shutdown, the arrival of goods was slightly thick. Although yesterday, the local rice went well. However, the goods owners found it difficult to sell. As a result, the market for both thick and thin Japonica rice was similar to the week before. The opening price of Wuxi fresh japonica was 134 yuan, Kunshan fresh japonica 132 yuan, secondary to 128 yuan, Nangang early and late rice fresh 132 yuan, 120 yuan, special 134 yuan. Secondary stored was short and there was no market, original package white 135 yuan to 132 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice is in season for the Dragon Boat Festival, and the destination is more prosperous. However, the goods rushing to the market for the festival are also not weak. This results in a balance between supply and demand, and there is a lack of changes in the market. Hong Kong white glutinous rice still opened at 112 yuan, and the secondary grade was 1089 yuan, national glutinous rice special original package sold at 124 yuan.</p>
<p>Speculators colluding with rice weevils are still manipulating the market and hoarding goods for profit. The Municipal Council is purchasing Burmese rice, which is being transshipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai in a continuous stream. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang and Nanning ships arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (25th), each carrying 10,000 bags. The Suzhou ship arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying 10,000 bags from Hong Kong. The Jiangsu ship only carried 5,700 bags, and unloading began yesterday. The first batch of tribute rice purchased by the French Municipal Council has also arrived in Shanghai, loaded on the Compagnie Maritime des Chargeurs Réunis' Général Joffre ship, which arrived at the port the day before yesterday (25th) morning. The ship directly loaded 3,600 tons from Saigon, about 17,000 bags. It is said that part of it is still for passengers.</p>
<p>Bean Cakes Frequently Appear</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains, oil cakes, and flour remained in a fluctuating trend. Although the current stock of soybean oil is controlled by the adjusting company, the sales market is sluggish and it is difficult to recover. Soybeans and corn have slightly increased, but bean cakes are frequently released due to unfavorable overall conditions, and sales have been declining. Although there has been some struggle in the middle, the downward trend has become established. As a result, it has fallen by 67 jiao compared to the end of last week. Statistics show that 50 pieces of Dalian soybean oil were opened, and the price is detailed in the market price column, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 1,500 bags of Guide soybeans, 200 bags of Jiaozhou beans, 400 bags of Tianjin beans, 140 bags of green beans, a total of 2,000 bags of spot and forward corn were traded, and 50,000 pieces of Shenji cakes were traded. On the 27th, 1,500 bags of corn will be shipped to Yantai.</p>
<p>Securities: Increased Number of Public Debt Buyers</p>
<p>The public debt black market trended slightly stronger yesterday. Tiansheng continued to buy, and Yuxing and Xinhua also bought, and the trend is gradually bullish. However, the pace will inevitably be slow. Yesterday morning, Tiansheng and Yuxing bought very actively. Cunyi and Jiufeng also showed interest. The sellers were Hongda, Lianhe, Datong, Tongkang, etc., who also sold some. The noon closing was relatively firm. There were more transactions in the afternoon. Grade A rose straight to 6 yuan in the buying by Xinhua and Lianyi. Tiansheng and Yuxing's interest remained strong, and Ruiyu also had demand. The suppliers were mostly scattered lots and short positions from Tongshun, Hengfu, Xinfu, Yizhong, Renchang, etc. However, all items were slightly firmer. The market price ultimately rebounded by 12 jiao to 5.5 jiao, with Grade A rising the most. The total trading volume was approximately 1.3 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of the new New Company were traded at a price of 19.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The public stock market was soft in the quiet. The prices on that day hardly changed.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: Japanese Yarn Prices Plummeted, Shuangma Arbitrage Sold Fusheng, Sales in Hong Kong Seemed to Turn Slightly, The Market Tried to Rise but Fell Instead</p>
<p>The yarn market is still hovering slightly, but the situation is very frustrating, so the upward momentum is particularly weak. However, Hong Kong merchants have stopped purchasing for a long time and are quite eager to move. Therefore, 900 packages of 10, 22, and 10 count yarns were purchased today, which lifted the stagnant and discouraged morale one step. Therefore, the market situation is soft with a hint of bullishness. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,425 yuan, and the low price was 1,415 yuan. The market continued to be stable after opening in the afternoon. Because the noon closing was good and Guang merchants had some transactions, the morale was stable. The initial trade was 1,424 yuan. Then, major players came to sell short, and it fell to 1,417 yuan, hovering between 15 and 16 yuan for a long time. After 3 o'clock, it was heard that the yarn and cloth market price of the exchange plummeted, and the popularity suddenly loosened, and a part of them suddenly came to sell arbitrage, and suddenly fell to 1,407 yuan. Later, the people who covered their positions were active, and they recovered to 1,412 yuan. As a result, with the foreign exchange tending to loosen by 0.3125, the closing price was 1,4056 yuan.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened tired yesterday. The first price was 1,419 yuan to 20 yuan. However, profits were covered, and the table was tightened. After a short time, it rose to 1,425 yuan. Then, it was heard that the foreign exchange did not move and the margin was mediocre. The market situation was weak again and fell to 1,418 yuan. Halfway through, Guang merchants had spot yarn transactions of 7800 packages, and the stagnant morale was revived. The situation returned to 1,424 yuan at the close. However, the transactions on the table were not as strong as the previous day. It was found that the statistics for half a day's transactions were 9,900 packages, of which 900 packages were handled by Hong Kong merchants, and the trading of the leather ball gang by the same industry and outside the industry accounted for 9,000 packages.</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Was Mediocre</p>
<p>The current cotton situation has become mediocre again. Because the yarn market is weak, the cotton market, which depends on it, is also affected. Although there are some movements between the numbers, the actual needs of the factory are not strong, and there is still a lack of favorable impact from all parties, so the transactions are still few. Yesterday, a total of 1,059 pieces were traded at a relatively stable price.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: East Cloth Plunged Wildly, Factory Cloth Sale Offers Vary</p>
<p>The trend of the factory cloth market continued to soften yesterday, because the end of the month is approaching, and all parties are waiting and watching. Due to the relationship between the quantity of goods, the sales offers varied. White goods, coarse cloth, and coarse twill were as firm as ever, while fine cloth and fine twill continued to decline, with each piece down by 2.5 to 5 jiao. A portion of bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 5 jiao. More than 400 pieces of various cloths were traded on the street. Guangdong and Hong Kong and Nanyang merchants purchased more than 200 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse twill, colored twill, and blue cloth. 16-pound Feihong coarse twill Hong Kong sold 13 yuan, and the legal gang sold more than 58 yuan, and there were continued purchases. On the 27th, 125 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<p>The trend of falling in East cloth is fierce again. The longtou fine cloth futures in the exchange are falling in each session, with each piece falling sharply by about 2 yuan, resulting in a consistent fall in the spot market. The back street factory stack sold opened at 44.35 yuan, a drop of 1.8 yuan compared to the previous week. The four gentlemen tweed in color was 1.41375 yuan at noon, and the evening closing also fell to 1.385 yuan, a drop of 3.5 minutes, which is relatively firm.</p>
<p>The Woolen Market Turned Dull</p>
<p>The woolen market took a dull turn yesterday. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants had already stopped purchasing. The street door shop gang reduced the need due to the heat and less actual sales. The Western clothing gang is preparing to collect relief items for the Dragon Boat Festival, and most of them are based on the principle of selling as they go. Sales of summer goods are sluggish, while sellers of autumn and winter wool are hoarding goods due to the tense atmosphere, shouting out prices, so although there is a need, the mood is not as strong as it was ten days ago.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Silk Exports Are Still Not Smooth</p>
<p>Yesterday, New York was closed due to the holiday. Yokohama's telegraphic message stated that silk prices rose slightly by 5 yuan, and futures rose by 7 yuan. Foreign silk sales are still not smooth. Yesterday, foreign firms only traded 5 packages, and the price was still stable. Sales of silk for end use have also stopped, so the market atmosphere is very quiet and tired.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Dutch Raw Sugar Continued to Fall by 3 Yuan, The Coarse White Market Also Softened</p>
<p>There was not much difference in the sugar market yesterday, but it still did not get rid of the soft image. The guild divided the market. The current spot two or four coarse white sugar arriving in February was 103 yuan. The late May futures were initially 104.2 jiao, then rose to 4.4 jiao. They still returned to 4 jiao, 4.2 jiao. June 10th futures in the morning were 105.5 jiao, 5.05 minutes, 5.25 jiao, and in the afternoon 105.1 jiao, then loosened to 4.9 jiao, 8 jiao, slightly less than the previous day's triangle. Dutch raw sugar spot was 81 yuan, slightly less than (17th) 3 yuan. Also, yesterday, 8,220 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Seafood: Western Sea Cucumbers Opened Firmly</p>
<p>Recently, Western sea cucumbers have arrived slightly. A batch has been opened, the number is not large, and the market is stable. For example, jade sea cucumber selected strips were 477 yuan, and the export office was 468 yuan, No. 1 was 436 yuan, No. 2 was 411 yuan, and No. 3 was 366 yuan. Red sea cucumber No. 1 was 245 yuan, No. 2 was 109 yuan, No. 3 was 163 yuan, the call number was 136 yuan, black circle sea cucumber large was 421 yuan, medium was 369 yuan to 334 yuan, small was 218 yuan, square sea cucumber large was 456 yuan, medium was 369 yuan, small was 268 yuan, plum strip sea cucumber export office was 194 yuan, No. 1 was 183 yuan, No. 2 was 152 yuan, round black sea cucumber large was 180 yuan, medium was 171 yuan, No. 1 small was 154 yuan, gray rock sea cucumber large was 391 yuan, medium was 339 yuan, small was 259 yuan, black rock sea cucumber large was 344 yuan, medium was 294 yuan, small was 245 yuan, peeled sea cucumber was 127 yuan to 117 yuan, bare sea cucumber such as the top bare was 879 yuan, the top big bare was 777 yuan, the big bare was 628 yuan, the medium bare was 566 yuan, the small medium bare was 151 yuan, and the small bare was 312 yuan.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials: Although Spring Flowers Rose, They Were Still Losing Money</p>
<p>Spring flowers were recently transported from the Yangtze River in dozens of pieces. The external costs were relatively high, and the cost was not light. Yesterday, it was heard that the asking price was 40% better than the old price, but according to the cost, it was still necessary to lose several yuan.</p>

<h3>Chen Feihong Invents Index Board</h3>
<p>(Fujian Shaxian Correspondence) Mr. Chen Feihong, an expert in library science and the current director of the Fujian Provincial Library, has recently invented an index board (English name: Index Board). It can be used in library catalog rooms, file storage rooms, bank depositor registration offices, and other institutions that use loose-leaf catalogs or card catalogs. It is more convenient, economical, durable, beautiful, and easier to search. There are rotating rack types, tabletop types, and wall-mounted types. The number of panels per rack is not fixed. Each panel uses 110 wooden strips, including 100 black strips, 8 blue strips, and 2 yellow strips. Yellow and blue strips indicate categories, and black strips indicate book titles, case names, or account names, etc. For usage, special white oil is used to write on the wooden strips, and the arrangement and usage are the same as card catalogs. Its feature is that if you want to change the written words, you can use special degreasing water to erase them. Currently, all libraries in Fujian Province have adopted it. It is said that a large number of local wood and famous lacquer work are used for manufacturing, which is cheaper than paper.</p>
<p>After the Central Relief Fund Was Distributed, Shanghai Teachers and Staff Sent a Telegram of Thanks</p>

<h3>Essentials of Guidance for Further Education and Employment (1) Shen Guanglie</h3>
<p>Guidance for further education and employment, in a broader sense, is educational guidance and vocational guidance. In addition to the issue of further education, the most prominent aspects of educational guidance, such as aptitude tests and interest surveys, are very important tasks. Vocational guidance, in the simplest terms, is to help individuals choose a career, prepare for a career, obtain a career, and improve a career. The employment problem is only one part of it. From the analysis and induction of both aspects, both belong to the field of vocational education. Education and career development are linked to meet the needs of society and have practical value. Career development adopts educational methods to have a scientific basis and achieve normal development. How to make the education and career circles communicate and work together is a problem worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>According to the daily work experience of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, the employment of career development has a gradual improvement trend, and does not completely adopt the previous inherited system. Recently, in addition to paying attention to talent assessment, many places are implementing vocational training, service ethics, knowledge and skills cultivation, etc. for staff, which is of course a gratifying phenomenon. Schools also pay attention to cultivating young people and provide practical guidance for students' future. Recently, before the winter and summer vacations, schools often have guidance for further education and employment, which is a very obvious example. The training problem in the current career development will not be discussed for the time being. First, we will make a brief exploration of the current facilities for guidance on further education and employment in various schools. Before explaining this work, there should be several basic understandings:</p>
<p>(1) Guidance for further education and employment is a long-term work. At present, various schools conduct tests for graduates before the holidays, invite people to give speeches, provide individual guidance, and conduct internships and visits, which are of course very good methods. However, limiting it to this, working once or twice a year, is really not enough. There should be a whole plan not only in peacetime, but also continued guidance and maintenance of considerable contact after graduation. It is by no means a short-term, temporary, routine work.</p>

<h3>Chicken</h3>
<p>—Wei Gan</p>
<p>For the past thirty years, I have lived a city life, especially in the lane houses of Shanghai, looking up at a sky that is only a few feet wide, and unable to step on even an inch of soil under my feet. The only small patio in front of the house is paved with cement, and not a single blade of grass can grow. Every day I breathe in coal smoke, without a trace of fresh air. Although the green grass is green every year and the flowers bloom in various ways, we have not seen them come and go in spring. Not for any title or career, I have abandoned so many years of good spring, and I feel a little wronged when I think about it. However, if you go to live in the countryside, no one will give you food. Life is still the first priority, and the pursuit of fame and wealth must be based on life as a prerequisite. You must first solve the problem of eating before you can talk about advancement and enjoyment. We live in the city, in the business district, and those who do not know always think that we are either seeking fame or profit, or doing something that seeks both fame and profit, but that is not the case. It is very pathetic to say that we are just urban parasites, relying on living in the city to make a living. Leaving the city, although there are birds singing and flowers fragrant, clear breeze and bright moon, you can pillow on springs and rinse your mouth with stones, you can sit on the moon and get drunk with flowers, you can listen to the songs of water chestnut pickers, and you can watch the farmers planting, but we writers who shake our pens are only spectators of the pastoral, not producers. Returning to the countryside requires many years of being a high official in the capital, with considerable savings before it is possible. Now that I have neither achieved fame nor wealth, how can I leave the city? For the sake of making a living and supporting my family, the result is that I have been eating in the city year after year, wasting many good days in spring and autumn, and not knowing that old age is coming.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I also lived in the countryside, with rice fields outside the door, green mountains and white clouds, morning glow and evening haze, it can be said that I was completely with nature. That kind of life is the most yearning and the most memorable. For decades, I have always wanted to work hard to do something to solve the problem of life, and go back to that kind of pastoral life as soon as possible. However, I have not achieved anything so far, and the war has broken out.</p>
<p>War can only give some people a chance to get rich, and it is absolutely not good for us writers. Unexpectedly, this war drove us out of the city, allowing me to approach the countryside again by accident, and to live in a thatched hut in the suburbs far away from the city, leaning against the mountains and facing the river. The surrounding area is full of open space, the color of grass enters the curtains, and the sound of insects penetrates the walls. Guests come and say that the scenery is not bad, and I am also complacent, thinking that it is full of poetry. Reading Du Zhanren's line "No wonder the poetic thoughts are clear and human, the door faces the cold stream and the mountains are full of snow", I also feel like I have become a poet who can withstand this compliment.</p>
<p>However, poetry does not help practical life. Even if I am a poet who can chant about the wind and the moon and write a few poems that are clear and human, what is the use? It is better to learn from the farm women to raise a few chickens, which is much more practical.</p>
<p>"You have such a big garden, you can raise chickens: they have plenty of wild food to find, and you don't need to feed them much feed." Those wives who do not have the temperament of poets but are good at managing their homes always say this when they come to my house.</p>
<p>I have heard these words repeatedly, and I am quite tempted, or rather, my index finger is moving (needless to say, the god of poetry has long abandoned me and gone elsewhere). Yes, I want to use this environment to raise chickens. Just raising ten chickens will lay ten eggs every day in the future, which is worth two or three yuan, and now buying a chicken costs more than ten yuan, so ten chickens are also a fortune.</p>
<p>It has been decades since I have lived in such an environment, and I should have engaged in the kind of chicken farming business that has all the benefits and no harm. Regarding production, it is better to do it sooner rather than later. The next day, when I came back from school, I met a seller of chicks on the road, and I bought ten of them from him. Those chicks were released from the cage and got such a large piece of free land. Their joy is definitely not something that we people who are tied to affairs can understand even a fraction of. Although they were born with a fatal fate, they will not know until the very end. Ignorance is happiness, so I can conclude that they are happier than anyone in their short lives.

<h3>Two Brothers Share Three Eyes</h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>Younger brother:</p>
<p>On May 12th, I received a letter from grandfather and was shocked to learn that you were injured in the right eye in Macau due to a school chemistry experiment that was mishandled. Many other students were also injured, but you were the most unfortunate.</p>
<p>Grandfather's letter also said that the next day after the accident, step-grandmother personally accompanied you to Dr. Huang's office in Hong Kong for treatment. This made us feel a little relieved.</p>
<p>On May 19th, I received another letter from grandmother saying that Dr. Huang must first pay a medical fee of HK$300, and it must be paid in full at one time. However, grandfather only had HK$200 left, and after many days of negotiation and delay, he was admitted to the Hong Kong Royal Hospital for diagnosis. Now, thinking about it carefully, the complete loss of your right eye was entirely due to the fault of the delay. And a part of this fault can be blamed on this kind of doctor in society who serves for "money".</p>
<p>Grandfather's third letter (which arrived at noon on May 22nd) finally brought the unfortunate news: your right eye was severely injured and cannot be restored. If it is not treated again, it is feared that it will be delayed to the left eye in two or three years.</p>
<p>When father saw this letter, I saw him standing silently for a while. Having experienced the world, the absence of tears in his eyes does not mean that he is not sad. His heart is praying for the future happiness of his son who has suffered hardships.</p>
<p>Mother, older sister, third sister, and fourth sister all knew the news and hid in several corners to shed tears. How can I comfort them for you? My own eyes were already filled with tears.</p>
<p>What about you? You are the most unfortunate one among us, and I understand your pain: in addition to being sad and indignant for yourself, you also hold a sense of guilt for making everyone in the family share a share of the pain for you.</p>
<p>After six years of separation, I did not expect that you would suffer this unexpected disaster alone when we were about to meet. This June is your twentieth birthday. We were planning to hold a celebration for you when we met. But what is there to celebrate now?</p>
<p>Your intelligence, your perseverance, and your filial piety are the most outstanding among the brothers, but you have suffered this disaster. Is it because of the jealousy of the creator?</p>
<p>I am heartbroken and ashamed that I am just an older brother and can do nothing about your pain. In addition to loving you twice as much in the future, what do you get? You have lost the joy that no price can redeem.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you still have one left eye to use. No, you have more eyes to use than before, because your brother's eyes will always take care of you and protect you from now on until the end of my life.</p>
<p>I hope that after reading my letter, you can "really" feel a little joy. I am unwilling to give you hypocritical sympathy. I want you to know that we are living together, not alone!</p>
<p>When we meet again, I want to see you with the same moving smile as before. Do you promise me? Wishing you health</p>

<h3>I Am the Mother of Three Children</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>When I think that I, who have been married for only four years, am already the mother of three children, I feel an invisible fear, boredom, joy, and ease—a complex heart, an unspeakable contradiction.</p>
<p>Every child is a record of my pain:</p>
<p>During pregnancy, in addition to physiological morbidity (even vomiting gastric juices), I also had to move around with a big belly to escape the war.</p>
<p>The cramping abdominal pain, wave after wave... My heart is like frozen ice, boiling water!</p>
<p>But this is a bubble, which disappears in an instant, disappears without a trace, a relic! When I see a sleeping little angel lying next to my bed, I forget everything—forget all the sorrows. I like to have a small life more on the earth, and I pray for the growth of this small life!</p>
<p>Qi, Pu, and Xuan are just like their names, all beautiful jades, and all are treasures in my heart!</p>
<p>My heart is deeply connected with my children. Every moment, I pay attention to their food, clothing, sleep, and games. When I go shopping, I will pay attention to the children's clothing displayed in the glass cabinet; when buying vegetables, I will first choose the tomatoes and carrots that Qi loves to eat; if there are any novel toys, I will not forget to buy them the same.</p>
<p>All day long, I am so busy taking care of my children that I can't breathe.</p>
<p>I also have to be careful about the health of my children. A groan from the children is like a needle in my heart, and the needle will not be removed until they are well.</p>
<p>After three years of training, my nerves are particularly sensitive. The children make a slight noise, and I will wake up immediately and urge them to go back to sleep. Looking at the children's apple-like faces, I suddenly feel excited.</p>
<p>With children, I have not enjoyed a fragrant sleep at night; with children, I also have no time to take care of the depth of powder and the height of leather shoes. It seems that the comfort and sustenance that the universe gives me are only children!</p>
<p>I don't admit that this is a sacrifice, but I am willing to fulfill the responsibility of being a "mother".</p>
<p>"I love mom!" When Qi kisses me mischievously, it almost makes me jump up with joy. What tiredness and boredom are there!</p>
<p>Children, Mom is not contradictory! That is, Mom will continue this contradiction forever!</p>
<h3>Education Is...</h3>
<p>— Wen Ya</p>
<p>Education is life.</p>
<p>Education is the continuous reorganization of experience, to increase the meaning of experience and to increase the individual's ability to use experience later.</p>
<p>Experience is life, and life is not in emptiness, but in the environment, and comes from this environment.</p>
<p>——John Dewey</p>

<p>From one ton of coal, the following by-products can be obtained: 10,000 cubic feet of coal gas, 25 pounds of ammonium sulfate, 3 gallons of petroleum ether, 6 pounds of liquid ammonia, gallons of tar, and 1,500 pounds of coke.</p>

<p>In fact, Begonia had already seen it before he moved.</p>
<p>The original text of the news is:</p>
<p>'Blood Case in the South of the City</p>
<p>Young Master Shoots and Kills Orderly</p>
<p>The Murderer Has Already Surrendered Himself That Night</p>
<p>The Yuan residence at No. 17 Tieshizi Hutong is another residence of Yuan Baofan, the garrison envoy of Rehe. In addition to Yuan's wife and three concubines living together in one house, his nephew Yuan Shaowen, (24 years old, unmarried, currently serving as a first-class secretary in the Rehe Garrison Envoy's Office and commander of the 31st Mixed Brigade of the Army,) also often stays in the residence whenever Yuan Garrison Envoy comes to Beijing. Last night, Yuan Shaowen questioned the orderly Ji Zhaoxiong (29 years old, from Shan County) about something, and the master and servant suddenly quarreled. Yuan, in a fit of anger, took out a pistol from his arms and fired at Ji, who was shot and killed on the spot. Afterwards, Yuan immediately surrendered himself to the Beijing Police Department and remained in jail awaiting trial. According to reporters, the orderly served as a guard in Yuan's residence in the British Concession of Tianjin. From his arrival in Beijing to being killed, it has been less than five days.'</p>
<p>Begonia looked at this short piece of news for a long time. Yu Kun thought that it was because he only had one eyeball left that he looked slower than others, but in fact, Begonia had already finished reading it. He just opened his eyes wide and was silently in a daze. (116)</p>

<h3>Taylor and Power's Married Life - Written on Their Second Wedding Anniversary</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Two years ago today, Taylor Power, with a bold and decisive spirit, married Annabella in Los Angeles without seeking the company's consent, in a manner as swift as lightning. At the time, most fans—especially female fans—were disappointed, believing that this charming young man was finished from then on, that he had taken the wrong path. With beauties aplenty, he shouldn't have married a foreign actress who had been married once before. Not only did fans feel this way, but many newspapers also expressed similar opinions. Thus, speculative prophets made such predictions: "In 1940, Taylor Power and Annabella will divorce." However, now that 1940 has passed, they have not divorced. On the contrary, their love has increased with the years of marriage! If you don't believe it, let's see how his married life is.</p>
<p>Changed Attitude</p>
<p>Previously, Taylor was completely satisfied with his own suave demeanor, a charming smile that made many women swoon. However, after marriage, he completely changed. Due to Annabella's supervision and encouragement, his attitude became more rigid. He devoted his heart and soul to his work, unafraid of difficulties, striving to succeed. He wants to be known for his acting skills in the future and doesn't want to be known as a generic Hollywood heartthrob. His lifestyle has gradually been assimilated by Annabella, developing an advanced and noble artistic taste, completely different from the restless and impulsive Taylor of the past. This can't be said to be a miracle!</p>
<p>Reading Together in the Boudoir</p>
<p>In these two years, besides work, they often spend quiet evenings together, reading by the lamp. Annabella reads French classics to him, and Taylor reads Shakespeare to her. Initially, Annabella translated for him. Now, after studying French for almost two years, he himself has proven to be a talented scholar. Such recitation is indeed very beneficial to Taylor, not only enriching his wisdom but also benefiting his body and mind. This is truly a good transformation, which must be credited to Annabella. Of course, a virtuous wife is invaluable, especially for a man like Taylor.</p>
<p>Perfect Companion</p>
<p>In Taylor's mind, Annabella is indeed a perfect companion, with seriousness and compassion taking precedence, and enjoyment coming second. No matter what the situation, he never sees Annabella having conflicting feelings, so he can't help but love her. After marriage, Taylor's home is no longer a place for Hollywood youths to frequent. In that magnificent home, one can often see the Colemans, the Charles Boyers, Warner Baxter, and others coming and going, in addition to producers and their wives. Annabella is naturally happy to see that he interacts with such gentlemen, and Taylor is deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Taylor's Confession</p>
<p>Once, Taylor said proudly to a reporter: "Do you remember? I once told you that my ideal wife should have a sense of humor, be dignified and honest, naturally humble, generous and loving, intelligent, able to handle all unexpected stimuli, have the spirit of 'sharing weal and woe,' and be a film actress so that she can understand my life and experiences. Annabella is my ideal woman. She has everything I hope for. Now, I am getting the true joy of life. This kind of life is meaningful, with a happy and comfortable state of mind, and everything is satisfactory. But for all this, I have to thank my Annabella."</p>
<h3>Notes on Pingsheng Kunqu Opera Troupe Rehearsal</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>The 24th was the 80th birthday of Zhou Jianchu's mother, a member of the Pingsheng Opera Troupe. All the troupe members held a special rehearsal at the Hushe from 2 PM to 12 AM. This troupe has been around for decades, with a constant stream of talent. They haven't had a rehearsal in years, so this was a rare opportunity.</p>
<p>When I arrived, Wu Xinzai was performing "Three Drunkennesses," with a beautiful appearance and solid singing. Next was Shen Shuying's "Eating Tea," full of integrity. Lu Chengzhang and Zhang Yanzhen's "Appreciating Lotuses" was still a maiden work, yet they were surprisingly calm and composed, which was not easy. Wu Yinan's "Sending a Son" was better than his previous performance of Li Qi in "Selling Horses." Xu Xiaoyin, playing the son, had a very loud and pleasant voice. In "Drunken Concubine," Zhang Zifang, playing Emperor Ming of Tang, flicked his sleeves and strode, quite freely and elegantly. Weng Yunshu, playing Yang Guifei, was on stage for the first time, and she also followed the rules. Gong Bingchu was quite competent in "Removing the Seal." Zai Yangzhen's "Foolish Dream" soared into the clouds, refreshing to listen to. In contrast, Ge Qifu's "Pavilion Meeting" had a very soft tone. But Mr. Ge is already fifty-five years old, and the meticulousness and calmness of his performance can be said to be consummate, entering a state of perfection. The raised sleeves and sidelong glances in "Looking at the Moon" and "Looking at the Tree Shade" were particularly beautiful. Yin Zhenxian and Ye Xiaohong are old partners. I have seen their "Quarreling" before, and now I saw their "Kneeling in the Pond." New and old hands are extraordinary. Zhu Yaowen was also very skilled in "Seeing Mother." Ai Tang said that the emotions in this play are mixed, and there can be various facial expressions. I said: "Why not make an exception and let the mother sit sideways and Wang Shipeng kneel sideways, both at right angles to the stage, so that the latter's expression can be seen." Ouyang Yuqian's new "Yutangchun" had made a bold attempt.</p>
<p>After dinner, Yu Bingshen's "Male Boat" passed by amidst the noise in the audience, which was a pity. I have seen Ms. Li Xunru's "Rear Kin" five times, and each time she is more skilled, with very good body movements. Ms. Yin Junong's posture in "Thinking of the Mortal World" and "Shaving Hair" is extremely beautiful. The dancing posture of bending down to the ground is also excellent, and the use of the whisk is very flexible. The finale was "Selling Horses." Wang Zhaochang played the jailer, and his son played Li Qi. I said it was not the jailer interrogating Li Qi, but the father teaching his son in "A Meeting with a Single Blade." Li Qi used to have a very good voice. The father with the small mustache was also successful. Xiao Ming is excellent in both Kunqu and Peking Opera. I saw her perform "Thirteenth Sister" at the Xuan Palace before. This time, I saw her perform Guizhi, showing the different personalities of heroism and gentleness, and I felt her technique was even more consummate, playing whatever she was like. Shen Hengyi's Zhao Chong is extremely restrained and refined. When singing "What grievances do you have in your heart," he does not touch Guizhi's chest but gently pushes Guizhi's shoulders with both hands. When singing "Speak in detail," he does not pull Guizhi's hand inward and outward to flick his sleeves. When Guizhi wakes up, he does not make a sweating gesture, nor does he say "Almost another life was lost." It seems that he is deliberately establishing Zhao Chong's identity, unwilling to go too far, and surpassing ordinary actors.</p>
<p>A Miscellaneous Writing from Shadow City. Huiyi. Barrymore Promotes Young Talent</p>
<p>John Barrymore is a veteran on the Hollywood silver screen. No one can match his qualifications. However, he is extremely diligent in guiding young talents. Therefore, the number of movie stars he has guided is countless. Every time John Barrymore is filming a movie, he takes in many students. These students are actors who are relatively free in the photography field, so that they can get practical practice. Recently, he starred in "The Invisible Woman" and took in many students, so he has the honorary title of Dean of Hollywood Film Circle.</p>
<p>Loretta Young is more proud than before. Loretta Young has been in the film industry for a long time. Last year, she was invited by Universal, and the famous silver filmmaker Frank Lloyd produced "The Lady From Chevenne," which was very successful, so the first film will be produced next, named "The Nioht Ours."</p>
<p>Diana Durbin as Consultant Diana Durbin was recently hired as a consultant by the Greek Relief Association. The chairman of the association, Reid Bi, personally lost her request at the photography scene, and she immediately agreed.</p>
<p>Joe Qi Joins Golden Star After Joining Golden Star, it was heard that he had been assigned to play the role of the murderer in the film "Gunshots in the Rainy Night."</p>
<h3>A Casual Talk on "Working Women"</h3>
<p>— Robert</p>
<p>"Zhiyuan Drama Society," this name is quite unfamiliar on the Shanghai drama scene, right? In fact, this drama society is another name for the "Jinan Drama Society," which enjoyed great fame many years ago. "Zhiyuan" is organized by Jinan University's male and female students who love drama. This time, the script for the public performance of "Working Women" was written by Mr. Shi Huafu, a professor in the Department of Foreign Languages ​​at Jinan University. And the director, Mr. Hong Mo, is also an alumnus of Jinan University; This is really a coincidence! "Working Women" is a four-act comedy, full of laughter and satire, targeting reality, so that the audience can recognize the faces of general corrupt people while laughing.</p>
<p>Li Si, who plays the "gentleman" director Fang Weide, is Mr. Li, who often writes for the economics section of this newspaper. He plays it very well, but his movements when courting Miss Zhang Fenglai are still a bit stiff and unnatural. Lucy, who plays Miss Zhang Fenglai, is Miss Tang, who will graduate this summer. Miss Tang has performed on stage many times in Qingxin Girls' High School and National Central University, so she has rich experience and plays it very naturally. Zijin, who plays Mrs. Fang, is very lifelike and convincing. Jin Qin, who plays Fang Yizhuo, is a fool, often eliciting laughter from the audience; However, her movements are sometimes a bit overdone, a bit like "acting"! Gong Ge, who plays Changfu, is very competent. The rest are average, but Honglou, who plays Fang Yihui, doesn't play lively enough, and her pronunciation is too low. Sometimes, people in the audience can't hear what she's saying. Finally, I wish all the members of the "Zhiyuan Drama Society" a great success, and I hope to see more beautiful performances from them in the near future!</p>
<h3>An Abstract of the Philosophy of Diligence</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Labor is for production, production is for survival, and the labor-based outlook on life is not only for self-sufficiency, but also for supporting others. Only those who can support themselves and others deserve to be called social people in the great era.</p>

<p>He was sighing when Liu Yin suddenly entered, smiling and asking, "Why is Brother Jing so deep in thought? Is there anything difficult to solve?" Xu Jing didn't want to tell him directly, so he replied, "I think the world is in chaos, with internal and external troubles arising at the same time. I wonder if Zhang Cangqiu and others can make achievements outside the Great Wall? I heard that the bandits have intentions to spy on Jin Province, intending to invade the capital. Their ambitions are not small and should not be regarded as poolside soldiers. I hate the fact that the generals in command are not capable, mediocre and incompetent, sometimes suppressing and sometimes appeasing, wavering and uncertain, which leads to the increasing flames of the bandits. It is difficult to remove the weeds, and I don’t know how to clean up the mess in the future?" Liu Yin said, "Those who occupy positions without doing anything are really killable. I heard that the current emperor is a wise ruler, but unfortunately, there is no one to assist him, and the country is getting worse day by day. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will wield a three-foot long sword with Brother Jing to clear away these demons." Xu Jing heard Liu Yin speak so passionately, and his eyebrows were raised, and his righteousness was visible on his face, so he said, "I will follow my virtuous brother and work hard together, so as not to let down the seven-foot body of a man." Liu Yin laughed again after hearing this and said, "Of the 140,000 people who laid down their armor together, not one was a man. There are many men in the world who are often afraid of death and stealing their lives. It is better to be a city lady army, who can also defend the country." Xu Jing was taken aback when he heard this. Liu Yin continued. "I hope that we can hold weapons to defend the country and increase its glory, to get rid of the shame of the past." Xu Jing smiled and said, "What you said is so straightforward, my virtuous brother. In a few days, I will go with you to see General Zhou Yuji, so that he can serve under his command." Liu Yin said; "I have a temper, that is, I don't like to ask to see people. As for fame and fortune, I don't care. I just want to do whatever I want. If I want to stay, I will stay, and if I want to leave, I will leave. So I don't want to be under the control of others, otherwise, why would I live in seclusion here?" Xu Jing nodded and said, "This is your noble ambition, indifferent to fame and fortune, and different from others." After dinner, Xu Jing said to Liu Yin: I want to go to bed early tonight, and maybe I will have to say goodbye and go down the mountain tomorrow to take a walk in the city.” Liu Yin heard this and said, “Then Brother Jing go to sleep early. We can talk tomorrow." So Liu Yin went back to his room. He lived in the same room with his aunt. After Xu Jing waited for Liu Yin to leave, he sat for a moment, closing his eyes to rest. Listening to the outside, there was no sound, he quickly stood up and took off his coat, put the Scarlet Phoenix Sword on his back and waist, and put on the Bailian Rope. He put out the candles, tiptoed out of the bedroom. He closed the door, and secretly opened a window in the study, jumped to the courtyard outside, and closed the window again. Fortunately, the walls were very low, Xu Jing had already jumped onto the wall and jumped out of the door. The starlight was shining, he looked around and saw no one, so he strode down Phoenix Ridge. He was on guard against wolves, but fortunately he didn't encounter any. He also hurriedly passed over Suanmao Ridge, left Weifeng Mountain, and flew to Daizhou City. (73—End of Chapter 9)</p>
