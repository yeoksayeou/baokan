<h3>豫南戰事</h3>
<p>中日戰局久在膠着沉悶之中，而最近旬日則又隨着春季屆臨，驟形活躍。自一月下旬起，整個的豫鄂戰區到處都展開了激戰。據哈瓦斯社三十日的重慶消息：中國軍委會發言人曾稱此一戰事爲重要戰役之一，其情勢當視此一週內之發展而定。這當然僅屬局部戰役，重慶方面且否認其爲日軍春季攻勢的先聲；然適值同盟國家的聯合攻勢與夫華軍發動大反攻消息頻傳的此際，自有予以密切注視的必要。</p>
<p>此度戰事，是在一月二十四日由豫南開信陽附近始的。在那以前，日軍已在鄂中的荊門洋梓及當陽鍾祥等地發動攻勢。進犯襄河兩岸與大洪山西麓。二十四日晨，日以兩師團兵力從信北的長台關出山店游河三據點分途北犯，而以主力結集於平漢路沿綫。同時更由信陽之西三路進兵進犯桐柏山麓，在豫東的開封，皖西的亳縣則向平漢路東側分別竄擾。從日方軍事佈置方面看來，可以證實此役確具有相當重要性質，並非年來日方所慣用的流竄戰術抑或所謂「掃蕩戰」可比。在戰略方面、自然平漢沿綫的日軍是主力，其目的無疑在打通平漢路綫；而鄂中豫東以至豫鄂邊境等處的日軍活動，都不外是用以牽制華軍的增防或調動。截至屬稿時止，除鄂中方面日軍早被驅逐而外，豫鄂邊境方面，經過數日激戰，在信陽確山桐柏三角區域中的日軍，亦正遭華軍包圍，只有沿鐵路綫的主力，在竄至駐馬店而後，分途進窺左面的西平舞陽，和右面的汝南上蔡，正面則兩軍方在汝河兩岸對峙。連日豫西華軍雲集，嚴密部署，日軍孤軍深入，殆難免重蹈前此鄂湘戰役的覆轍。</p>
<p>此次主要戰塲的河南中部平原，據南北東西的要衝，原爲中國歷史上兵家所必爭。自從二十七年春的徐州戰役結束了第一期中日戰事的第二個節段，日方的本意，原要由豫北豫東沿平漢綫以攻略武漢，但因黃河潰決，在流從鄭州東北直泛濫到淮河流域，形成不可逾越的天塹，日軍纔不得不另沿長江及皖鄂邊境一帶迂迴向武漢進兵，付出了倍蓰的代價。及至武漢廣州相繼棄守之後，日方戰略舉棋不定，失却重心，始終徘徊於繼續內犯與確保佔領地帶二途之間；而打通由北平直達廣州這一幹綫的企圖，經過幾度嘗試失敗，亦復暫行擱置。河南中部平原這一地區，迄今已有將近兩年未經戰事。今茲日軍突在多方調遣之後，突採攻勢，這雖然適值日方的政治季節，却未可僅僅視爲爲了向議會誇耀「戰功」，以便通過軍事預算以至總動員法修正案之類。其更重要的用意，却在於打通這一縱貫中原的幹綫，佔取總綰東西南北要衝的地區，以便「凍結」在華軍事，「建設」佔領區域，間接也就是騰挪實力，從事於南進的一種必要準備。日本外相松岡近來在議會裏一再吐露和平氣息，這是對議會，亦即對於一般日本人民，所施政治的麻醉，　武的煙幕，並不足視爲對中國的和平攻勢；因爲以它的聽明，至少知道在日本繼續其各種方式的侵略期間，斷乎得不到和平。日本確想從中國的戰塲裏拔出兩隻泥足來，但是要想拔出一隻，亦必依恃所殘餘的實力，作最後的試；而最近在豫南所取較大規模的攻勢，正是嘗試的表現。</p>
<p>豫南會戰猶在中途，未告段落，姑不問其結果怎樣進退，但祗是局部進退；中國會收穫或大或小的消耗戰果，日本却不會完成其拔出泥足兩隻或一隻的願望。當然，今年的中國必不以僅僅使對方消耗爲滿足；所可惜者：軍事重器材缺乏却阻滯了全盤反攻的遂行。即以此度豫南戰局而論，各綫日軍俱未得逞，惟有沿鐵路綫的主力略能有所進展，在華軍也只有運用靈活的運動戰術以資應付，無疑是由於雙方戰具配備的懸殊。本報昨日社評已力言美國援助中英必須迅速從事，爭取機先，希望美國議會方面更能從現在進行着的中日戰役接受這一事實上的深刻敎訓。</p>

<p>歐戰業談（卅三）</p>
<h3>美國外交上的秘聞</h3>
<p>美國名記者阿爾索Joseph　Alsop和金納Robert　Kintner兩人，曾於這次歐戰爆發之後，在美國外交方面搜集各種資料，編印成册，名叫「美國白皮書」，說明美國自慕尼克會議至戰事發作時爲止的一段外交史，揭發世人所不知的內幕情形甚多。該書現已暢銷至第七版，茲節譯於後：</p>
<p>一九三九年九月一日晨二時四十分，華盛頓白宮電話機上鈴聲震響。睡眼惺忪的夜班接綫員把綫接通，便聽得一個聲音道，「巴黎長途電話」，接着另有一個非常尖銳和粗糙的聲音道，「我可以同總統通話嗎？」接綫員辨出這是美國駐法大使蒲立德的聲音，便轉接給總統秘書勒亨小姐，謂蒲立德大使要和總統說話。蒲立德是有資格在日間或夜裏和總統直接通話的兩三人之一，因此，勒亨小姐便吩咐道，「接過去。」接綫員便把電話接到總統臥室。總統在這些日子裏本來有些寢不安席，聽得電話鈴響，便立刻坐起，把牀邊的電話筒拿了起來。</p>
<p>「是誰？」</p>
<p>「是別爾蒲立德，總統先生。」</p>
<p>「哦，別爾。」（按別爾是蒲立德的小名）</p>
<p>「東尼皮特爾（美國駐波蘭大使）剛從華沙打來電話說，德軍數師已深入波蘭境內，正在激戰。華沙上空已發現轟炸機多架。他說到這裹，電話就突然斷了。他在和我通話之前，曾想向你報告，但是費了半點鐘的工夫，仍沒有接通。」</p>
<p>「好吧，別爾，事情到底發作了。願上帝保佑我們吧</p>
<p>兩人又談了幾分錡話。蒲立德要求總統試行「試法不使他們向我們下蛋，」他的意思是請總統通電要求交戰各國避免轟炸非武裝城市。兩人又討論了撤退歐洲美僑辦法。於是總統說一聲「別爾，多謝你，我現在要和考台爾（係國務卿赫爾的小名）等人討論了，」便把電話掛斷。</p>
<p>就在道幾句平淡的對話裏，美國政府已知道第二次世界大戰爆發了。</p>
<p>國務院的電報間是全院神經中樞，電報機不息地動着，關於張伯倫和達賴第的希望，德國外交部的暗示，蘇聯政府的密談，中國長江流域新出的事變，巴爾幹所感受的威脅，都有密電報告。這些電報譯成明碼，複印之後，蓋上「機秘」兩宇的戳子，便整天在各辦公室裏傳遞。先在二樓南部，呈報國務卿赫爾和國務副鄉威爾斯，再拿到樓上給西歐司長摩法，最後依電報的來源，分別交到「英國」，「西班牙」，「義大利」或「斯干蒂那維亞各國」寫字臺，由主管各公務員，分門別類，一一加以分析。</p>
<p>同時在白宮方面，羅斯福總統每天收到電報三大批。大多數日子還接到駐各國大使公使的特別報告，如長途電話，專差報告和航空密件之類。他時常把白天的情報作爲臨睡的讀物，一面在報告上做着記號，以便次日處理。但國務院方面討論的問題如果重大，也隨時向他報告。這時他使瀏覽各種有關文件，召見赫爾或威爾斯談話，並以「便條」傳述他的意見，指示國務院方面討論的方針，然後由國務院用電報訓令駐某某國使節，遵照辦理。</p>
<p>一九三八年慕尼克四巨頭會議乃是美國外交政策轉變的關鍵。在慕尼克會議前，美國的世界政策，以唱和爲主，但在一九三八年八月杪，美國駐德大使戚爾遜報告希特勒侵略捷克的野心，顯已不可搖撼，美國便採取積極的和現實的政策。一切和平希望都付諸東流，美國不能再袖手旁觀了。</p>
<p>到了九月二十四日，希特勒和張伯倫，達賴第，貝奈斯間關係，緊張達於極點。次日，國務院和白宮忙碌一天結果，便擬就羅期福總統呼籲和平的電文，於二十六日晨一時同時拍發英法德捷四國政府。</p>
<p>希特勒的覆電牽涉到凡爾賽和的，同時在九月二十七日那天，戰爭似乎迫在眉睫。總統一早就在臥室裏召集政府首腦人員，舉行聚急會議，決定兩種最後步驟：一是由總統以私人名義，懇切地致電墨索里尼，請其斡旋和平；一是山威爾斯和國務院幫辦裴爾兩人趕聚草擬答覆希特勒的電稿。</p>
<p>但在草擬覆電的時候，又牽涉到美國作何行動的問題來了。最初主張召開和平會議，並擬定九月二十九日在海牙和平宮舉行，美國方面則派遣視察員一名出席。繼又主張，凡與政治問題平行的任何經濟問題，美國亦願參加討論。但在這兩個草案送到白宮的時候，赫爾堅決反對，總統也不以爲然，於是決定僅主張「在歐洲某中立地點開會，」討論和平條件。威爾期又和駐英駐法兩國大使通電話，請他們探聽張伯倫和達拉第的反響。的模晚餐時分，兩大使回電說，各駐在國政府都表示同意。</p>
<p>這晚上，赫爾，威爾斯，裴爾二人，又會見總統。總統爲了修正拍給墨索里尼的電文，已忙了整天。當他正在修改答覆希持勒的電稿時，消息傳來，謂德軍即晚就要啟釁，總統聞訊，怒不可遏。但這種消息，仍屬揣測，不可盡信，事不宜遲，便不再咬文嚼字，就發電兩通，直截了當呼籲和平。總統在九點半鐘分別簽宇，當晚發出。</p>
<p>次日的事情已是世人所熟知，即希特勒邀請張伯倫舉行會議，墨索里尼也徇總統之請，出任斡旋，大局因得暫時化險爲夷。　（未完）</p>

<h3>工部局佈置完密　納稅會順利進行　日將派觀察員到會列席　外僑對局方財政貢意見</h3>
<p>日籍納稅人、於前日（一日）下午二時、在日本俱樂部舉行全體大會、已正式作最後決定、對五日在跑馬廳重行召集納稅人特別大會、表決工部局增稅百分之四十案、日本納稅人將拒絕參加、此一消息、已誌昨報、茲聞日方所恃爲藉口者、約有二點、（一）日籍納稅人、認彼等對於增稅問題之見解、已於一月二十三日舉行納稅人特別大會時、由林雄吉發表無遺、因之對於日僑納稅人會常務委員會所提出之不參加特別納稅人會之建議、一致表示贊成、（二）日籍納稅人以爲納稅人特別大會下次開會時、係就上次大會議程、繼續討論、是、以認爲彼等之參加、爲「無意義」之舉、故出以悍然拒絕之態度、但據泰晤士報云、日籍納稅人會常務委員會、將於下星期初開會、選舉觀察員、列席納稅人特別會議、</p>
<p>佈置就緒　戒備加嚴</p>
<p>工部局方面、自始對於廿三日大會中斷一事、抱鎭靜態度、尤以總董凱自威及副總董卡納爲然、即在日方揚言不參加重開之大會後、因自信不致形成重大困難、亦釋然置之、仍積極進行籌備重開、各項措置、業已先後準備就緒、屆時除納稅人憑綠色卡紙精印之表決票入塲外、外人非經特別准許、一概不得入內、警備方面較上次更爲周密、靜安寺路上之大門兩處及馬霍路孟德蘭路口之總入口處加派巡捕站崗、對進出人士、予以嚴重注意、會塲入口處則由各國籍巡捕及巡長等把守、檢騐表決票、又主席台四周、因上次有日納稅人蜂湧台前企圖拆毀主席台情事、故設法使之與納稅人座位隔絕、因此納稅人如欲登台發言、不復如上次之方便矣、</p>
<p>議案可望　圓滿通過</p>
<p>大會準於後日下午二時半開始舉行、上次業已討論之議程、不再重複、由領事團主席希爾主席、仍由工部局幫辦納喜爲大會秘書、開會後、首由主席將日人所提之修正案提交大會正式表決後、再由英納稅人李德爾提出關於加捐案之第二修正案、謂房主自用之屋、自今年一月份起、其估價增高百分之四十、工部局幷得對於未曾建築之土地徵收附加地捐、此案由愛杜附議經工部局總董凱自威申辯後、即付大會表決、於是加捐問題、完全解決、進而討論增加執照費案、由凱自威申述理由、經李德爾提議麥格遜附議、要求修正以免增牛奶棚執照費後、由大會正式表決後、即行散會、預計大會可於一小時半內結束、</p>
<p>舉債問題　不致實行</p>
<p>公共租界之春季房地捐等總數約一千五百萬元、原應於今年年初徵收、但因工部局有待於納稅西人大會、對於加捐案之決定、迄未收集、前傳工部局擬舉債暫爲彌補、以支付上月份職工薪給及債券利息等、此說不能證實、但據關係方面觀察、此次大會延期僅及兩周、在此短時期中、工部局不致因稅款未收而財政上發生嚴重困難、後日大會重開、加捐案一經通過、工部局自次日起、即能依照新稅率徵收春季捐稅、經濟困難、遂無由發生、</p>
<h3>開源應同時節流</h3>
<p>專家　建議</p>
<p>若名經濟評論家阿勒斯、昨在英文大美週報發表一論文、對工部局財政問題、有所批評、並供獻開源節流辦法多項、略稱、本市人士中寗願見工部局財政破產而不願增稅者、大不乏人、殊不知工部局財政若破產、至少將發生三大不利之事、第一、納稅人所受之負担、決不因工部局破產而减輕、第二、若不幸而發生破產之事、則正爲日本人及某方乘此擠入之良好機會、如此則本市利益、即將蒙其不利、甚辛租界制度、亦將因而發生動搖、第三、工部局破產將使本市所僅存之商業繁榮、隨之以俱去、阿氏根據上述理由、敦促納稅人通過工部局之增稅案、若因納稅人贊成而通過、並非納稅人極誠擁謹該局財政政策之謂、工部局應副大衆之希望、實行開源節流、阿氏並作如下之建議、謂上海人十對於間接直接增加工部局高級職員薪水一辦法、顯然已表示反對、工部局每次增加職員新水時、低級職員所得、爲數極有限、而高級職員往往可得數百元、此事實不可解、余以爲工部局今後應規定職員薪給過若干元後、即不再增加薪水、或給予津貼、以言節流、本市之股票交易所、實爲最良好最合理之徵稅對象、今若能向本市股票交易所徵收百分之二之稅、則積之一年、可得二百五十萬元、此數額相當可觀、最後、局方父可向一切運至上海之物品徵收碼頭費、此外又可向未建屋之空地徵稅、</p>
<p>西僑　批評</p>
<p>昨有某西僑致函字林西報、批評工部局徵稅方法之失當、要求迅予改善、略謂、貴報評論凱自威被刺事件時、稱凱氏之被刺、正渠「爲全社會之最大利益」企圖通過白分之四十增稅案之時、我人不禁有下列數疑問、以質高明、工部局一再向負担極重之人十增稅、使物價隨之俱漲、而對於有力資助工部局者、或賴工部局存在彼等始能存在之輩獨加靑睞、不敢動其毫髮、凡此種種、能稱之「爲全社會之最大利害」而努力否、工部局對重要之日常必需品及房屋徵稅、而置利占大有之大商業於不問不聞、此得稱之「爲全社會之最大利益」而努力否、於此可見目下之徵稅制度、實屬錯誤百出、目下若向商業利潤徵稅、則不唯工部局所需要之款項可藉以取得、即公衆負担之房捐及增高之執照費、亦可不致再行過加、工部局若能進一步向賭塲股票交易所及娼妓徵收重稅、則並地捐亦可取銷、蓋世界各地、莫不對奢侈品徵以重稅、而對於大衆之必需品之徵稅、則應謹愼從事也、</p>
<h3>商團華隊紥營</h3>
<p>前昨二日（一日二日）爲萬國商團中華隊繼繙譯隊後補行紮營集訓之期、時值舊曆歲首、兼以天寒風冽、而該隊正常各員、遵令到塲者仍極踴躍、全隊於一日中午、携帶行囊、集合工部局操練廳、首由隊長陳時俠少校隊副余顯恩中尉曁各官長點名、檢閱行列、香騐服裝、並訓話後、即按照預訂秩序、於一時進膳、餐畢、開始課程、由軍佐黃國華及各上十等協助指揮、二時起、由中尉王廷魁敎導堆置沙袋工事、三時半爲架紮鐵絲網、五時茶點、六時戰略操練、八時晚膳、九時巷戰講堂、十一時歸號、全體宿於商團俱樂部健身房內、第二日上午六時起身、七時由張廷桂中尉指示快槍練習、七時三刻早膳後、行軍出發圓明園路演習巷戰、十時則爲沙盤講堂、課程由中尉周慶恩·徐紹楣·鍾玉亭等演講、十一時半練習機關槍、十二時半午膳、午後一時由李玉書中尉演講驅散亂徒防範暴動之方略、講畢復至圓明園路實地試習、下午五時舉行茶會、並有滑稽家程笑亭管先靈到塲義務表演、以佐餘與、直至六時半許、復由陳隊長集隊致謝後始散、聞該隊此次紮營、成績秩序均極良佳、該團新任總司令曼恩中校及前司令亨培上校、均會蒞臨視察、對各該昌精神之奮發、操習之認眞、表示甚爲愉快</p>
<h3>國米運滬　有非正式接洽　工部局等曾經交換意見</h3>
<p>字林報云、「市長」陳公博上星期四日在華懋飯店宴請工部局食物供應小組委員會委員、如馬歇爾爵士與烏康納爾等、該次集會乃非正式性質、衆信彼等係對本市米糧局勢、交換意見、同時、法幣價值雖漲落不定、但米糧情况、確已好轉、現本市存米充足、可供此後數月所需、且有大量洋米不久運到、故民食前途、可稱樂觀、公共租界當局前曾間接籲請本市日軍當局、准許國米運來、不加阻撓、聞工部局發此籲請後、迄未接何確切答覆、</p>
<h3>東亞被壓迫民族　一致隨華作戰　朝鮮義勇軍已正式成立　中國勝利時即獲得解放</h3>
<p>據最近出版之密勒氏評論報云、日本自甲午奪取台灣及朝鮮起、統治數十年、無非造成被壓迫人民之仇恨、直至今日、中國之奮起作戰、始卞若輩人民以新希望、台灣人全係中國人種、其土地向爲中國之部、朝鮮則向爲半獨立之中國藩屬、比年以來、束亞被壓迫各弱小民族、尋覓一領導東亞之國家、乃小向東京去尋而羣集於重慶、有大量朝鮮人正在助華作戰、台灣有志之士、亦莫不皆然、</p>
<p>蔣委員長　予以協助</p>
<p>惟其間略有不同、朝鮮人之志願、在恢復故國、其性質爲中國之協約國、台灣本爲中國領土、其性質正如東三省軍人之自我作戰、二十年來、朝鮮人在中國設有秘密政府、　得滅亡國外韓人之擁護、對日恐怖行爲、時有所聞、此項朝鮮政治首領、現時均在重慶、三星期則、蔣委員長特准其編成朝鮮軍一隊、俾得拚其熱血、以與壓迫者相見於疆塲、</p>
<p>正式武裝　共爭勝利</p>
<p>事實上朝鮮靑年、久已雜入華軍中助戰、數日以前、有一團體慶祝其兩週紀念、此即「朝鮮義勇軍」、其人數現有三百名、其任務除戰事工作外、並注重拉攏日軍隊伍中之朝鮮人、使之助華、惟前此朝鮮人未能領得軍械、現經政府核准、將正式武裝、改名爲「朝鮮義勇軍」、惟若輩並非爲恢復李氏江山而戰、（李氏昏懦降日、韓人深恨之）、其宗旨在建立獨立民主之新國家、堅信其必能隨中國之勝利而達到目的、</p>
<h3>法大使　戈斯默　確已由越返滬</h3>
<p>法駐華大使戈期默、離滬赴渝、歷時五月、先後在中國戰時首都重慶逗留、其間戈氏會晋謁中樞當局、關於貝當政府及法越南政府對華情形、有所說明、旋即赴成都、主持撒消法駐蓉領事館事宜、乃於二月六日由渝乘中航機飛港、旋以越南法泰關係緊張、戈氏乃匆匆買棹去西貢、會晤德古中將、留越幾一月、茲以公畢、乃乘法郵潘興將軍號來滬、茲據新聲社記者、向法領事館方面探悉、大使確已於前日下午六時抵埠、現寓海格路大使私邸、短期內不擬他去、將在滬作久留</p>
<h3>法公董局法律顧問　至今虛懸</h3>
<p>自法公董局法律顧問杜格、於上年被刺殞命後、其在生前所任法公董局法律顧問之職務、據平明社記者昨向關係方面訪悉、因公董局至今未有另委人員、杜氏遺缺、現仍虛懸、至今尚未能決定繼任人選、至法租界房租調解委員會主席一職、亦無人兼任、會務已陷停頓、</p>
<h3>滇緬路已通郵</h3>
<p>昆明郵局現已有寄至滬港及國外郵件一批、裝車運抵臘戍、將經仰光出口、嗣後復有數批、循該路運輸出口、</p>
<h3>十山灣孤兒院工人　大部復工　被裁工人均　係專門人才</h3>
<p>關於徐家滙土山灣孤兒院全部職工五百餘人、前因要求改良待遇、發生工潮後、旋即由院方應允取消原來米貼每月四元五角、另行津貼秈米成人一斗、小兒五升、全體勞方認爲滿意復工、詎院方忽又變卦、致勞方重復發生工潮、茲悉被捕之勞方代表施家平、已於前日釋放、院方對被裁之職工、即日發給工資二個月或三個月、其他未被裁之職工、四百廿餘人、已於昨晨七時正式復工、至所裁職工八十餘人、業已組織團體、呼籲請求各界社會人士予以同情、盼各界錄用、內有排字工人·銅匠·木匠·彫刻匠·等專門人才、現極願各界如有需要、儘量錄用、該項工人、均在餘家滙五埭頭大巍　居、</p>
<h3>福清口外小島被佔　滬閩航運受阻</h3>
<p>昨據航業界消息、閩省福淸口外之　小島、於上月中旬、爲日海軍所佔領、致滬閩航綫、又受阻碍、查日海軍於去歲七月十五日宣佈封鎖浙閩航運後、滬閩航運、僅賴此綫維持、行駛之外輪爲新安納·新安利·永豐·永泰·開林·馬勒等數艘、聞新安納於上月由滬擬駛福淸、但未及駛出、即被扣留、致其餘各輪、則均閒泊滬濱、又悉本埠英商怡隆輪船公司、謀恢復滬閩航綫、業已派神佑輪試航閩海口之三都澳、</p>
<h3>藥材又漲價　病家負擔日增</h3>
<p>浙閩沿海、自被日軍封鎖後、貨物均須轉輾運輸、國產藥村、因產於川廣者居多、自海口被封後、均取道香港來滬、日來因港滙升漲、每百斤計漲港幣二三十元、故市價均告激增、如西砂米廣木香計漲百分二十及百分之四十、大府杏仁漲百分之十廿、而尤以川雲貨爲甚、如川貝黃附塊麝香等、較去年下半年竟激漲十餘倍之多、滬市輸出、亦以香港爲首位、自滬溫航綫停頓後、藥材去溫每年减少達三四千萬元之多、此外滁州出產之丹參、因產量减少、　不應求、故售價已自每枚七十元漲至二百元、且感無貨應市、其他各貨、皆因紅盤提高而飛漲、零配藥劑之價格、平均漲起二分之一、故病家負擔、隨之增高、</p>
<h3>西報記者　讚譽湘桂鐵路　車輛集中加强軍運貨運　員司精神煥發努力服務</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報通訊員伊普斯坦云、中國在戰前、鐵路本不甚多、開戰以來、多數淪於日軍之手、少數亦由華軍自己破壞、但有一事頗可注意、即原有鐵路之車頭車輛貨車、大部分未落人手、現時大批集中於粤漢鐵路之湖南段、及自衡陽至廣西之鐵路、此兩條鐵路、現爲自由中國交通之中心、亦爲舊日鐵路之殘餘、吉光片羽、彌足珍貴、其功用除疏邋貨品外、尚可以高速度調動大批軍隊、往三方面之主要戰塲、（一向武漢、一向廣州、一達桂邊）、此三戰塲、中國去年均迭獲勝利、大有增强中國作戰之信心、但同時却大損日軍之威望、其中湘桂鐵路、係於開戰後加工趕築、奇蹟驚人、</p>
<p>華麗臥車　佈置精潔</p>
<p>記者旅行內地、經過火綫及無路可通之地域、其間交通極爲困苦、一日忽抵湖南南部之中國鐵路錢、不覺覩一意外奇事、中國經過四年之苦戰後、人人心目中必以爲火車必破碎不堪、乘客將不勝其苦、詎知記者乘入之車輛、乃係一最奢華之臥車、整理潔淨、一切設備俱全、即守車之管理人、亦制服輝煌、各皆精神煥發、竟乃舒適之至、</p>
<p>各路車輛　集中於是</p>
<p>此中理由、亦甚簡單、蓋以中國車輛之精華、如比利時製造之綠色快車、著名之平滬藍鋼車等、並未落入日軍之手、隨軍隊以俱去、現方集中於此兩條路綫上、凡各大站之岔迸上、車輛停集如雲、彌望皆是、車上均印有北寗·津浦·京滬·等等標字、有幾輛且書有中東鐵路標宇、至鐵路原有人員、均隨車輛以俱來、故各車站及車上、皆可見言語不同來自五方八處之職員、若輩多經過極大艱辛、以搶救鐵路村料者、</p>
<p>衡陽已成　交通樞紐</p>
<p>車抵衡陽、衡陽爲隨戰事而發達之城市、地勢衝要、三年以前、尚不過一小城、今則爲全國交通運輸之總樞紐、由此處赴自由中國各處之要道輻輳、無論何處需要大批援軍、或某省某區飢饉需繼、或華西建設需要機器鋼鐵、則其接濟之道、無有不須經過衡陽者、衡陽因係新城、故其外表與湘雀各大城之舊式者不同、街路寬廣、蔭本整齊、人民多來自他省、因之語言並不齊一、而鐵路工廠及他種工廠、正在方興未艾、</p>
<h3>警方鏟除烟賭罪惡　破獲華麗賭窟　銀宮酒肆樓上搜查亘三小時　賭具應有盡有煙具價值不貲</h3>
<p>字林報云、工部局警務處竭力剷除公共租界內烟賭罪惡、昨日（一日）午後二時、派探員在輻煦路九百八十二號銀宮酒肆樓上、破獲富麗堂皇之烟賭窟、抄出大批賭具、如輪盤賭·蘋果賭·骰子·籌碼·及桌椅數十張、用卡車一幷載入捕房、此外、探員並沒收大批紙烟·雪茄·錢箱·領入窟設之申請書賬簿·酒及搖骰子等人之男女制服、探員搜查至六時始畢、</p>
<p>煙賭雜陳　堂皇富麗</p>
<p>結果非但破獲其係賭窟、且發現供給吸食雅片該罪惡塲所係若干外人結黨經營、共佔六室、其四作賭博用、另有兩室、設備華麗、供人吸毒、故探員並抄獲全副烟具、內有鑲銀烏木烟槍三支、烟燈及烟缸等、探員又往該賭窟之飲酒間、抄出賬簿·酒杯·肥皂·與毛巾、飲酒間後一室內、正在製造大小等賭具、亦被抄獲、時賭窟中有八人、以事出不意、皆束手被捕、衆信彼等經盤問後、將牽連他人、至於有無外僑被捕、昨夜尚無　實消息、</p>
<p>半個月來　破獲六處</p>
<p>警方注意該賭窟巳非一日、且知其中從事小規模之賭博、惟昨加搜查、旣獲大批賭具、乃知經營者正準備擴大範圍、聞昨日破獲之賭窟、爲警方於一個半月來查封各賭窟中之最富丽者、其傢具·賭具·制服·　鑲銀烟槍等、較界外馬路區各賭塲之設備、有過之而無不及、自去年十二月二十六日以還、公共租界警方破獲之賭窟、至昨日已屬第六所、乃使界內烟賭罪惡之剷除、距實現更近一步、警務處邇來破獲之賭窟、最先爲靜安寺路之一所、當塲拘獲葡人一名、其後在戈登路·海格路·德義大樓·與滄洲飯店、絡續破獲賭窟四處、此外、警務處禁毒科探員、亦在華記路破獲毒窟拘獲兩人、抄出價值二萬元之生土與白面、</p>
<h3>法院丁役要求津貼　短期內可解決</h3>

<h3>五官倒置之奇形怪狀胎兒　瞿醫師解釋發育之原委　標本存生生醫院備研究</h3>
<p>本月某日、有某婦因懷孕臨月、腹部頻頻作痛、前往薩坡賽路五十七號生生醫院生產、當由院長瞿紹衡夫人姚英乃醫師、用手術取出女性胎兒、細察面部、其五官部位、殊與常人不同、鼻在額而孔朝天、眼在鼻下、兩球併合、一如初放並蒂之蓮、眼臉相通、又若口吐金魚之眼、耳在頸中、恰如大口橫張、細檢口裂、杳無痕跡、</p>
<p>怪胎形成科學解說</p>
<p>據瞿醫師語記者云、俗云怪胎、所以爲神鬼之所祟而成、胥多羞而惡之、然以科學之胎生學證之、則或爲胎內生活之初期發育障礙、或爲兒體雖死、而絨毛膜及羊膜之增殖不已而成、所謂由小而大者、不大或過大、由短而長者、不長或過長、由細而粗者、不粗或過粗、由實而成腔者、不成腔、由簡而繁者不繁、合而分者不分、分而合者不合而成也、何羞有、何惡有、</p>
<p>畸形胎兒千奇百怪</p>
<p>考古來胎兒畸形之種類、千狀萬態、難以數計、有一身兩頭者、有兩身一頭者、有一頭兩面者、有無手或無足者、有有頭無體者、有有體無頭者、此皆發育異常之所致也、然如此兒之形狀者、實爲產科學上空前僅有之畸形也、</p>
<p>此胎各部發育解釋</p>
<p>究其所以如此發育之原因、約可作如下之解釋、鼻本位於顔面、中央而爲兩眼境界、今因下部脫離而向上翻、故鼻孔朝天、而眼居鼻下、兩眼本以鼻爲境界而分左右、今鼻旣向上、則兩眼無間隔而併成一起、故形雖合而實則分、球旣併、則臉自通、眼下全部不發育、故無口亦無顎、旣無顎、則兩側耳垂自相曳近、所謂形如大口橫張者、自然之理也、</p>

<h3>上海工業之回顧與前瞻</h3>
<p>— 俞燮麟</p>
<p>上海工業，發剙甚早，且亦發展甚速，蓋上海爲我國國際貿易之中心。國內金融之樞紐，交通便利，又爲原料與製造品之集散地，故各種工業相　設立。二十四年上期，據中央工廠檢查處之調查，已達五千四百八十家之多，約占全國工廠半數以上。尤以重要之紗廠　粉廠　絲業等主要輕工業，均集於上海一隅。故稱上海爲我國之工業中心，誰曰不宜。</p>
<p>「八一三」滬戰爆發，工廠會聚之處，如閘北　口南市一帶，悉遭砲火之摧殘，我國數十年來苦心經營，而初具規模之工業，即遭嚴重之損失。據各方面之調查，被害之工廠達二千家以上，損失之總額在八萬萬元左右，此實堪稱我國民族工業之空前浩刦也。</p>
<p>上海工業之變態景氣</p>
<p>在滬戰之時，全滬工業咸處於停　之狀態，待國軍西撤，上海暫入苟安之局面，於是在租界上之工廠，紛紛復工，又有自戰區遷入租界之工廠，亦相　覓地開工，於二十七年間，上海工業之復興與發展，已有顯著之活潑，頓呈繁榮之局面。然則在戰時創傷之　，爲何即迅速能恢復景氣之狀態，按當時情況，約有下列數端特殊原由：其一，我國工業被占事摧殘以後，全國製造品之消費，悉仰給於上海。政府當局雖積極建設內地，但在內地工業基礎尚未確立之前，製成品仍須由上海供給；故當時上海製造品，經由浙閩海岸，以及香港海防諸港，運入內地之數量，爲數極鉅。其二，自上海進入苟安局面以後，淪陷區之人民紛紛集中滬上，於是人口激增，購買力亦告增加，乃百業興盛，致成特殊之景氣，上海工業之得以復興發展，實受此刺激也；故在戰時新設之工廠，多屬於製造消費品者也，其三，人口之增加，與資金之流入，有密切之關係，於是淪陷區內之資金，大量流入上海；且自歐戰以後，香港一帶之游資，亦紛紛流來。於是上海游資，更形充斥。一般穩健之資本家，覩工業之好轉，乃或間接投資，或直接經營新興事業。工業既得充足之資金，其發展自屬易也，故工業之創設，竟如雨後春筍。其四，外匯猛縮，物價暴騰，均能獲空前之利潤。但因物價之高漲，終不及匯價降落之速，輒因舶來品價格之過昂，乃感有國貨代替之必要，此尤以人民日常生活必需品爲然。同時又因匯價暴跌之結果，使上海物價低於國外物價水凖，於是促進製造品之向外發展。基此四因，上海工業均獲厚利，而呈繁榮。但此繁榮，實係變態景氣。物價之暴漲，悉爲投機所操縱，故上海一般工業咸處在惡劣環境之中。迫至二十九年五月初旬，匯價上漲，一般製造品之價格，即起反動猛落，其以棉紗等跌落最甚，一般工業即遭非常之打擊。二年來之變態景氣，頓告終止。</p>
<p>半年來之上海工業動態</p>
<p>自五月以降，上海工業即進入衰落之境，或减低生產，或竟停工，至八月而達極頂。九月以後，雖稍改進，但尚未能完全膠離衰落之地步。如現今惡劣之環境，未能改善。茲將半年來上海工業之環境與動態，略述於下：</p>
<p>（一）原料之短絀　上海工業之發展，賴於原料供給之充足。原料之供給，全賴於附近各省。自戰後沿海各省相繼淪陷，於是淪陷區之主要資源，如棉花　絲羊毛小麥烟草煤鐵銅等，悉爲日人所壟斷與統制，於此下半年，更爲加甚。得以輸入上海者，數量微極。如棉花，我國爲產棉之國，在戰前二年間，產量均達千萬擔以上，已能達自給自足之地步，二十九年之產量，估計亦在八百萬擔左右，華北之棉產，早已禁止出口，華中之棉產，亦悉被統制殆盡，其能輸來，以供上海紗廠之消費，其數亦極有限，故是後紗廠之生存，惟有賴於外棉之供給，　粉廠缺乏原料之程度，較之紗廠爲尤甚，於八月各廠開工之日數，僅二日半，於九月較有增加，亦僅八日而已。烟業所需之烟葉，素賴於山東與河南之出產，但今全賴於國外之輸入，故華商烟廠，因烟草供給之不足，致產量大减，僅及戰前一成而已。自華中區蠶絲會社成立以後，淪陷區之　產，悉爲自統制，開工之廠，僅七家而已，戰前萬部絲車以上之盛況，恐在戰時，不復有再見之可能。至如紗廠　粉廠烟廠等雖可利用外國原料，以抵補本國原料之短絀，但當今困難重重，亦難達原料供給充足之地步；非但因外匯緊縮，外國原料價格之過高，又因歐戰之影響，運輸船雙之不足。又如上海之構膠業，素賴於外國原料，但因歐戰之影響，馬來半島禁止橡皮出口，以致被迫處於停頓之狀態。是故上海工業原料問題，必將更感恐慌。</p>
<p>（二）市塲之缺乏　上海工業之發展，全賴於有良好之市場，戰前以富庶之長江流域爲主，華北與華中爲輔。自戰後沿海一帶以及華中諸省相繼淪陷後，淪陷區之商業，已有獨佔之現象，致上海工業製品，已失長江流域與華北之良好市塲。在戰後雖因本地需要之增加，與南洋市塲之開拓。但其過去之景氣，實築在不健全之基礎上彰彰明矣。於七月初旬，中越交通載斷，同時香港空氣緊張，降至七月十五日浙閩海岸象山港，溫州，三都澳，福州各港口之突然封鎖，十八日滇頃公路又告封鎖，上海與內地之交通完全斷絕，此於上海工業之影響，極爲嚴重，俾工業製品之市塲，更爲狹窄。此舉更加甚五月以來之工業恐慌。於十月十八日滇緬公路雖重行開放，但此路運輸　有限，不足以解除製品之出路問題。南洋市塲之開拓，雖自歐戰以後，頗具成效，但在日美競爭之下，我國制製品輸出之增加，亦頗有限。故在此半年以來，貨運阻梗，又乏市塲，產銷狀況已失平衡。於是各廠不得不出於减工之途，藉以維持。九月以後，出路問題雖稍有改進，但在上述困難未能解除之前，製品之市塲問題，仍堪　也，況當今日人加　　之統制，限制竟或禁止國貨之輸入，故上海工業之前途，實堪憂也。</p>
<p>（三）投機之壟斷　戰後游　充斥，　投機瘋狂之結果，致　品市塲全黨投　者所壟斷。投機之壟斷，將物價任意升降，致　　失衡。故五月初旬投機家之失敗，即給工業界以一嚴重之打擊。即於棉紗而言，本　之銷數實超　銷二倍以上，七八九三個月內，本　　　之數達十四萬包，客幫僅銷四萬包而已。投機者之吸收，均屬　貨性質，如商品市繼續在投機者操縱之下，則商品之　　，必日趨更厚，此與上海工業之前途，實一嚴重之威脅。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>總之，上海工業在戰時之下，原料被統制，即感有不　之困難，又　交通梗阻。運輸困難，市塲被佔，在如此　況之下，前途如何，不問可知。上海工業，因困難之日增，其地位亦必日益削弱。後方之工業，經三年來之積極建設，已略具規模矣，現今正待繼續發展，　樹立我國新工業之基礎。政府當局應獎勵　資之內移，與新廠之籌設，使上海資本家與實業家乃可得一光明之出路，不致再徘徊於惡劣環境之內。對於上海已有之工廠，廉採積極之經濟辦法，以維持民族工業之生產能力，不宜任其自然，聽其消長，以攢國家經濟之實力。</p>
<h3>我國保險業現況</h3>
<p>— 莫杏林</p>
<p>保險事業，大部分爲兩種，一種是人壽保險，一種是財產保險，但是人壽保險，不過以人的壽命爲對象，而完全是儲蓄性質，和財產保險，完全不同，所以我所說的，門指着財產保險（如水險火險船險汽車險等一類）而言，儲蓄性質的人壽保險，不在本文範圍以內。</p>
<p>保險業的現象</p>
<p>我國有保險公司，遠在清季光緒年間，已有了四五十年的歷史。動機尚因我國當時自辦了一個輪船招商局，以爲外人爲了航業競爭，竟聯合停止承保　輪的水險（包括船穀，平安，水漬，等險），以資壓迫；華商纔創辦「仁濟和」和其他的幾個保險公司，以相抵制；後來有幾家，因爲辦理不善，宜告解散了；逢到巨大保額時，仍舊不能全歸華商公司承保；祇好轉保於洋商，賺些佣金，變成一個大搧客而已，直到四十年後的今日，中間雖曾開辦了不少保險公司，但是物價日高的現在，仍舊感覺得資力薄弱，不能脫離洋商公司的桎梏而完全獨立經營。截至今日，我國投資於保險業的，總共不過二千餘萬元。有表如下：</p>
<p>保險業擴充的需要</p>
<p>保險業的實力，依照前段所列之表，其實收資本，連在外國註冊的華商公司在內，總計不過二千萬元左右，（至於國營的中央信託局保險部資力與規模則較大）。如此區區資力，不够勝任保險事業之發展是顯而易見的。</p>
<p>我們先把火險一項來做一個例子吧：譬如一所鋼骨水泥的堆棧，他堆上五百萬元值價的貨物；這是一件極普通的事吧？那末他的總保額已相當鉅大。假使他是一所化上二三百萬元造價的八層或十多層的鋼骨大廈，那末連他內部的生裝李，亦得一體都保上火險，纔得放心；但是我保險業的最多二千萬　資本，怎麽能全部接受呢？在保險公司的承保額，於一個範圍內，「或指四面馬路內的一圈，或指四面都用綱骨水泥構造的一所堆棧」，不過接受了依照實收資本的百分之七八爲比例；或者該公司已經開辦了多年，有了相當的公積金了，纔能酌量多保一些。那末他們的承保額，最多亦不過二百餘萬元，其餘的半數或竟不止半數，都得直接或間接，一起轉往洋商公司投保了。那每年漏巵的保費，總有上幾千萬國幣被洋商公司捆載而去！</p>
<p>至於水險一項，分門別類，名目繁多；什麼船穀（輪船爲凖不動產，故又別於普通水險）險，平安險，水漬險，更有所謂碼頭險，駁船險等分別；如果發生賠償問題時，更要依據學理，條分縷板塊地辦明他的責任，纔能確定如何負擔？詳細說明，事太累贅了。好在讀者看了前段火險情形，也可概見其餘。可是每艘輪船的數百萬元造價，和每一艘輪船的可以裝載數百萬地的貨物，都是極容易看見的事實吧。</p>
<p>所以我們依照保險公司可能接受的承保額，即實收資本的百分之七八至百分之十的推算起來，那末經營保險的實收資本，非得達到五六千萬元不可。否則，就不能完全自立了；非常時期的物價，其投保額更大了；所以除去了現在各保險公司已有的資本，就知道至少可以增加三四千萬元之多，或竟不止哩。這或是一個可以容納游資的出路吧？</p>

<h3>星期六　票據授受</h3>
<p>竟有發生時間限制　予顧客以種種不利</p>
<p>自銀行業星期六下午休業頓予大多數顧客以不便。其實爲去年某一星期六擠提，一時不及應付，而懲前毖後，特將今年星期六下午休假，未免覺得銀行界只顧自己便利，貪圖安全，而不顧往來客戶及其他各業之便利安全，殊有說不過去，不意星期六票據交換時間，又由銀凖會定爲（一）會員錢莊票據，當日上午十一時前，（二）交換銀行以外之銀行信託公司票據，十時三十分前，（三）其他外行票據十時前，華商銀行因需轉托該會代收，遂將收受票據時間更行提早，傳聞有等竟限制收票時間爲上午十時者，逾時　收星期一賬，如某外商銀行週六若有顧客存入華商銀錢業票據，一律入星期一之賬者，似此情形，一則妨礙票扭流通，再則不但予顧客以不便，甚至利息吃虧，亦有因之被迫不得不以現銷相授受，此爲絕對多數之銀行存戶利益計，既不能　銀行界取銷星期六下午休假，則對於收受票據時間理應至午正截止，蓋銀行在營業時間以內，均有收受當日票據（即星期六上午十二時存入票據均應收入當日之賬）之義務，至於同業票據交換時間，在銀行業既同力言星期六下午休業，非爲貪圖休息，取快游閑。乃爲防範擠提不得已之舉，則可展　下午交換，未爲晚也，且看銀行界有無盡其爲公眾服務之職責，而於其營業期間照收支票，不使顧客受虧也。（壽）</p>

<h3>星期日數推算法（續）</h3>
<p>— 鄭朝强</p>
<p>（三）一九三七年八月十三日（第二次滬戰開始日）：（13+2+37+9）÷7=8餘数5。</p>
<p>就是「八一三」爲星期五。</p>
<p>照上面幾個例看起來，可知道這種算法準備而且便當。用這個算法我們可以求知本世紀的任何紀念日爲星期幾，也可以推算我們的生日爲星期幾，例假是在本世紀的話。</p>
<p>這種算法的原理很簡單。上面所列的月份指數，很容易可以看出就是普通算法中所用的一九零零年的月份指數。因爲常年爲三百六十五日，即五十二星期零一日，那麼過了一個常年，第二年的月份指數應該都加一。閏年比常年多一日，所以過了一個閏日，月份指數又增加一。那麼本世紀某年某月的指數應爲一九零零年那一個月的指數加一九零零年到這一年的年數，再加一九零零年到這一年這一月的已過閏日數。這三個數就是上面公式中的三項，若再加上日數，那麼七除總和的餘數爲幾應爲那天的星期幾了。</p>
<p>以上算法若不加更改，是不能用於其他世紀的，因爲每世紀的第一年如一九零零年，二零零零年等是沒有閏的。所以若要把以上公式用到其他世紀，不是要更改月份指數，就是要更改餘數的意義。譬如我們若把上面的公式和月份指數用到廿一世紀，我們必須把餘數一爲星期六，二爲星期日，三爲星期一…。例如二零零年元旦爲星期六，我們必須把餘數爲星期六，二爲星期日，三爲星期一…。例如二零零零年元旦爲星期六，因（1+0+0+0）÷7之餘數爲一。這可以從一九九九年除夕爲星期五斷定爲不錯。這樣可以推算此後任何日爲星期幾了</p>
<p>應用到十九世紀時，則餘數一爲星期三，二爲星期四…。例如一八六六年十一月十二日（孫總理生日）爲星期一，因（1213+66+16）÷7之餘數爲六。</p>
<p>十八世紀時歷法經過一次修改，從一七五二年九月十四日起至一七九九年十二月卅一日止任何日的星期日數，若照上式計算，則餘數一爲星期五，二爲星期六…。例如一七八九年七月十四日（法國大革命日）爲星期二，因（14+6+89+22）÷7之餘數爲五。一七五二年九月二日以前至西歷紀元每四年都有一閏，就是每世紀首年也有閏的，所以用以上公式時，年數應爲全數而不是末二字，已過之閏日數要從紀元算起。餘數之意義同十八世紀後期一樣，即餘數一爲星期五…。例如一二四零年五月十三日爲星期日）。因13+1+1240+310）÷7之餘數爲三。按照以上所述，西歷紀元後歷史上任何重要日期爲星期幾均可算知了。</p>
<p>同時用這種算法可以求得普通算法中所用的任何年度的月份指數，因爲一個月的最後一天爲星期幾，下個月的指數即爲幾。譬如去年十二月卅一日爲星期一，那麼今年一月的指數爲二；一月卅一日爲星期五，二月的指數爲五。用以上的公式我們可以算得今年每月最後一天爲星期幾，即得下個月的指數爲幾。現在把今年每月的指數列下：</p>
<p>月：一　二　三　四　五　六　七　八　九　十　十一　十二</p>
<p>指數：二　五　五　一　三　六　一　四　零　二　五　零</p>
<p>應用這些指數我們可由以下簡式的餘數求得今年任何日爲星期幾：</p>
<p>（日數　十　月份指數）÷7</p>
<p>例如今年的國慶日爲星期五，因（10+2）÷7之餘數爲五。</p>

<h3>米貴謠</h3>
<p>— 孫成</p>
<p>我禾陶簃先生，博學多能，性喜吟詠，民二出宰黄巖時，適浙省烟禁嚴切，該邑本產烟漿，限令指日肅清，故時乘轎赴鄉，親往查勘，曾賦黃巖禁烟七律一首曰：「搜別烟花羽檄馳，出郊小隊逐晨曦，篮與路轉臨懸澗，山谷笳鳴識有司，（台俗民悍，然頗畏官，故縣官每出，鳴號以警，）峯迓不妨憑軾頷，市喧正值趁墟期，九句半作山中容，剷毒心勞謝賦詩。」八一三後，避難來滬，依舊詩酒自遺，去年米每石至四十元時，曾撰米貴謠曰：「我華本農國，產米歲連阡，拼九常餘三，飽食嬉豐年，今歲雨暘和，收成足稻秈，奈何價步漲，斗米逾十千，高貨且弗論，平價至冊元，苦哉升斗民，手恃數百錢，于于來米肆，躊躇不敢前，米儈张目視，叱斥此戔戔，旁睨他顧容，餅金僅易箍，屛息人叢立，邏者軀着鞭，我儕避地客，凡百皆可省，惟米是民天，當此收成時，艱食已堪憐，青黄不接候，無米眞憂煎，衆口訾壟斷，產地貴何緣？實蒙誰人賜？阻運施苛捐，君不聞湖湘米價半江浙，蕪湖市上聯穑結纜皆米船，本有飯米田，（禾諺謂田租少數，為飯米田）今居此孤岛，數米聳吟肩。」比來米價繼長增高，已及百元一石，鄉農糶米，騶得多金，大都縱意揮霍，不知節蓄，故又撰續米貴謠以警之，文曰：「竿頭日上米價騰，入市人歸悶不樂，避兵蝨處孤岛間，百市軒昂生事蹙，最占高峯數米糧，十金僅足市斗粟，餘物稱是各倍蓰，繼長增高若追逐，市儈本來惟利圖，奈何平準無當局，緊桑靈轍滿路徵，善堂　葬日百櫝，惟有蚩蚩自耕農，米珠薪桂徼天福，田塲收益歲加增，大肉肥魚恣鼓腹，橒蒱一擲劉毅豪，雀戰百金未蹙足，租賦兩逋年復年，糶粟航歸金滿橐，咄哉所苦都市民，市蔬論兩值論角，一樣辛勤終歲苦，歲人能買米幾斛？吁唴乎！大局澄清終有時，天心剝極將必復，供求貴賤有常衡，市價調劑首米穀，農民農民乘此裕時務節储，莫使他年醫瘡再剜肉。」苦口婆心，有益農民，故錄實本刊，以廣宣傳。</p>
<h3>耒陽物價</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>友人張君，自申出發赴湖南耒陽，途中涉水登山，舟車步行各半，且時遇空　，狂奔躲避，達十餘次，沿途所經，斷垣殘壁，觸目皆是！轉輾一月，方始到達，承告耒陽近况及最近物價，以見牛活之一斑，略云：「耒地即三國時代龐統所治之耒陽縣，距衡陽約二百餘里，民風尙厚，生活較低，計米價每石二十五六元，鷄每斤一元左右，猪肉及猪油每斤八角，鷄蛋每元十六枚，出產煤炭每百斤五元，湘蓮每斤一元强，惟日用品奇昂起碼香烟每包六七角，自來火每包一角，食鹽每斤一元二三角，且不易購得，綢布衣料尤貴。耒陽地方面積甚小，主要營業均在衡陽，惟警報尙少，娛樂塲所雖有戲院四五家，均係演唱湘戲，江浙人實不能得其佳趣也」云云。諺云：「出門一里，不如家裏」，况處斯非常時期之行旅，其艱難困苦，自不待言，深盼光明來臨，重整交通，以利行旅也。</p>
<h3>怎樣鑒別綢布</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>怎樣鑒別衣料？當趟進綢布店，在店員們殷勤招待嚴密包圍之下，以匆促的時間來從事慎重的選擇，至少在事先當有一個極簡單的預備，這裏，根據筆者服務的經騐，介紹幾個比較迅捷的方法：</p>
<p>關於絲綢的：鑒別絲綢優劣的方法，雖然絲綢身地輕薄，經緯組織的嚴密與否，不容有掩飾與隱藏，幾可一望而知，但同一絲綢，也大有輕重之別，即以我們盛綢中的光扣紡而論，身分輕重與價格，每疋甚至相差達十元上下，每尺自然也得二三角，這裏，我們必須用嚴密的眼光來加以鑒別了，絲綢分兩重者，如電力紡，廠縐等等，以綢而膩滿光亮為上品；分兩輕者，如尺六盛紡，店濮等等，則以綢而平勻飘逸為第一：並且絲綢容易攙雜漿膠，漿膠重者，以手搓散屑粉下。漿膠輕者，以舌舔味有甜膩，舐過之處，綢面並不立刻濕透。至於組織是否嚴密，則用手在單幅的綢面上，就其邊緣順直用力一扯，發見如松花形等倂絲，或魚鳞批裂狀態者，此種綢面不耐穿，不過分兩輕重與價目廉昂之間，得稍加　別而已。</p>
<p>關於棉布的：至於鑒別棉布，較諸絲綢是更簡單了，如屬漿厚布薄，向陽觀之，即可察出經緯之間，布眼完全為漿膠所掩沒，而且布面也比較硬扳，有特發極光。布身堅牢與否？可以把布執其一端，先扯其橫面，再扯其縱面，以扯後仍如原狀無長短歪斜者為佳。染色之布，用白手帕在布面上往來疾擦，發見帕上有色，布面有暈，則布旣漿重，而且色料低劣。經緯紗綫揪断時，毛而鬆者布劣，光而堅者耐穿，更有一种麻織品，介乎絲綢棉布之間，用手在布面撫摩，覺滑面堅，團皺以後，折痕纍纍。這是購衣料者不可不加以注意的。</p>
<p>此外，呢絨，嗶嘰之類，非筆者所知，不敢妄事懸揣，有待於此道中有經騐者來介紹了。</p>
<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>春節是一年中一個大吃特吃的季節，吃過年夜飯，接連新年酒，除了自己家裏不算，還要到親戚朋友們家裏跑跑，到處總是大嚼，一陣子魚啊，肉啊，鷄啊，鴨啊，吃得油膩膩的，這幾天連胃口也吃倒了。爲了調劑口味起見，我奉勸在這一星期間要多吃菜蔬等清淡的東西，好在這幾天菜蔬的價格也特別便宜，油菜塌窠菜，每斤只須五分，菜劍每把只須三分，不但便宜而已，要是多用些油煮熟之後，也酥糯可口，眞的不可不吃。若是無飯不吃葷的人，覺得吃素吃不慣，那麼不妨將蝦仁和油菜同炒，將肉絲和菜劍同炒，也總算吃吃小葷了。此外清炒銀絲芥，糟滷黃豆芽，蝦米拌膠菜，醬蔴油辣白菜，也是多吃油膩之後調劑口味的恩物。</p>
<p>星期一　韮芽炒肉絲　雪菜燉黃魚　清炒塌窠菜　蝦米拌膠菜</p>
<p>星期二　芹菜牛肉絲　蛤蜊鯽魚湯　紅　素十景　幹絲菉豆芽</p>
<p>星期三　菜劍炒肉絲　蝦米蛋花湯　清炒銀絲芥　菠菜燒豆腐</p>
<p>星期四　番薯牛肉絲　粉皮花鰱頭　油菜炒綫粉　麻醬拌水芹</p>
<p>星期五　菜花炒肉片　糖醋溜黃魚　紅燒　萄片　糟滷黃豆芽</p>
<p>星期六　洋蔥牛肉絲　油菜炒蝦仁　紅燒捲心菜　海蜇　萄絲</p>
<p>星期日　炒鷄雜　煎帶魚　金花菜　辣白菜</p>
<p>事養小志　橘　張鏡人</p>
<p>橘　高丈許，枝多生刺，其葉兩頭尖，綠色光面，大寸餘，長二寸許，四日着小白花，甚香，結實至冬黃熟，大者如盃，包中有瓣，瓣中有核，味微甘酸，色兼黄赤。皮粗　厚，多液而甘者，俗稱蜜橘，閔產者色紅，曰福橘，皮絡均堪入藥。相似化州有橘　株，在署中，以其皮橘紅，瀹湯飲之，痰立釋。清社未屋，專作包茅之貢，故民間不易得之。藥舖所售之化橘紅，大抵俱為贗品。本經　皮能理氣化痰，燥濕行滯；絡治衛氣，逆於肺之脈脹，通經絡滯氣，驅皮裏膜外之積痰。近時西人煉製其汁為藥片，曰維他命西，取其生津消食之功耳。故人以其　於滋養力而恣啖之，殊不知其味帶酸，生痰亦能事也。橘之神話頗多，如幽怪錄；巴印橘園中霜後見橘如缶，剖開中有二老叟　弈，曰：橘中之樂小减商山。神仙傳：蘇仙公自母曰：某受命當仙，明年天下疫疾，井水一升，橘葉一枚可療一人，來年果有疫，求母療之，無不愈者。故後世遂名象戲曰橘中戲，而稱醫術為橘幷天。古人謂橘有美德，是以屈原以之自喻。漢武帝於交趾設橘官，秩二百石，主貢御橘，論者為奢。然今日暹羅蜜橘售價奇昂，而食者頗不乏人，豈與古人有同嗜乎？</p>
<p>天廚食譜（四）</p>
<h3>（七四）春卷</h3>
<p>預備：春卷皮子（市上現成有售）　　花肉　韭芽（或茭菜及冬筍）　醬油　味精　酒</p>
<p>製法：將買來之春卷皮子，先上甑蒸至微熟取出，使其可以張張撕開為度，另將猪肉平舖於砧墩上面，用刀先依肉紋　成薄片，再切成細絲，經清水洗淨過後，即投入鍋內用葷油炒之，至脫生，復加料酒少許，將鍋蓋蓋好燒一二分鐘，旋即啓蓋，再加適量之醬油及味精等，微和以水，蓋燒數透，（或加韭芽和壠肉絲同炒亦佳）俟肉爛熟，便可鏟起，再用皮子逐張卷之，卷好，入油鍋中煎，煎至兩面黃而微焦，卽可取食，新春備此點心饗客，頗為適宜。</p>
<h3>（七五）元寶肉</h3>
<p>預備：橄欖　猪肉　味精　氷塘　醬油　酒</p>
<p>製法：將肉洗淨後，先入鍋和水燒一透，批去其膜，加料酒少許續燒數透，然後再加適量之醬油，氷塘，味精等，俟肉煒爛，乃將橄欖（約十個）外皮劃紋放下，再燜燒十餘分鐘卽成，其味非常香美。</p>
<p>諸君：如欲購買「味精」，「天廚醬油精液」，及油鹽醬醋者，請撥電話「四四五九四」，當卽專差送奉，不取送力。</p>

<h3>又</h3>
<p>— 淑英</p>
<p>又漲價了，又加捐了，又……窮人聽見「又」就發愁！</p>
<p>又一新舞廳開幕，又一「人間天堂」的玩意兒出現，又……富人聽得「又」自然樂不可耐。</p>
<p>語云：「福不雙至，禍不單行。」可是現在，窮人的「禍」固然不「單行」；富人的「福」却偏偏會「雙至」。這就無怪窮人要怨恨「又」；富人要歌頌「又」了。</p>
<p>本來，儘有人可以出來干涉「又」，可以使「一而不又，又而爲一」的；如今却被「又」後面的錢箝制着，捨不得「直接行動」…</p>
<p>這樣，直要到「又」鬧得實在不成樣子的時候，才出來板着臉孔「敎訓」一番。富人當然報之以冷笑；窮人呢，祇有三個字：「又」來了！</p>
<p>又一年了，來日方長，請管「又」諸公，「一日三省吾身」，不要「又」爲了一點兒錢，使窮市民永處愁城，是所至盼！</p>
<h3>與數字作搏鬬的人們</h3>
<p>— 鍾子芒</p>
<p>泛着蒙脫卡羅麻醉風的「春節」</p>
<p>春節——是一個賭的季節。</p>
<p>春節的人們在骰子與輪盤的漩渦裏　着，轉着，浮沉着！</p>
<p>街頭骰子在靑花菜碗裏跳躍，那個載着圓氈帽的「攤主」，口裹念念有詞：「開仔哉！元寶滾進來，啊呀，么五作對一倍三……」這種「賭歌」配着骰子和鈔票的動態，唱着，圍着一些粗野的漢子，所以有着粗野的叱喝聲，還有一些地痞流氓，抽着劣等的杳烟，向四面張望把風」，有時巡捕來了，將攤子驅散，可是過後又聚集了……</p>
<p>那裏，是一個修汽車行，爲了春節放了假，幾個學徒坐在地上玩着撲克，各人膝前放了破舊的鈔票，不一會又爭吵了「老K」和「皮蛋」相擲着，分頭幣被風一吹，幾乎滾入了溝渠。……</p>
<p>這是一條衖堂，聲聲傳來洗牌的動作，那一副象牙牌——三百多隻在白的桌布上飄流，這批太太奶奶們，平日便以此消遣的，過年該更熱鬧一些，十塊底十六圈，從午飯後打到午夜，男人也沒有回來，大的是開房間玩去了，不要跟着隻狐狸精……</p>
<p>嗯，是這個蜂窠般的建築物，從朝到夜是浸在百來支奶油燈泡的富光裹，侍役忙得很，每個房間裏穿梭着，帳房先生接應着電話：</p>
<p>「…對不起，房間嘸沒空格，……去年老早　光哉！」</p>
<p>房間裏，熱水汀沸騰着，做莊的人堆着堆堆鈔票角子，旁邊的人圍着，一個人急切的把那一對牙牌拿起來，靠在這一邊的人的服睛瞪大了：「天之　！」欣喜地；可是那個莊家手氣郤「紅」得很，是一對「人牌」，欣喜的神經還水收歙，又是一陣頹喪的輕微的咒駡了。</p>
<p>「老張，賭得還不够勁，上「×國飯店」去。」</p>
<p>撥動了汽車輪，無數的顆樹往後面退，「飯店」的停汽車處，都擠滿了黑牌的。</p>
<p>裏面：是熱浪，大的玻璃檯子，圍坐的人們爆着靑筋，汗珠流動，從額上滴到下巴；西裝的脫了大衣，脫了馬甲，領帶歪了；中裝的脫了大衣，脫了馬掛，鈕扣鬆了；買籌碼的地方像着出巴戲：兩百，五百，一千，五千的買着，簽着支票：一萬元，五萬元，十萬元；坐下去，香噴噴的手巾來了，熱的綠茶來了，肚子餓嗎？那櫻脣媚眼的姑娘指引你到大菜間去。</p>
<p>輪盤上的數字盤，這一大堆鈔票的屬誰，等着你的裁判……</p>
<p>老年人和一批雅士者流是喜歡哼哼和和的，如果賭起錢來而沒有一些詩算是「煞風景」的，所以有「打詩謎」的玩意，集在電火下堆着詩條，像「迎風婀娜〇初飛」，還是打「雁」呢，打「燕」呢，打「蝶」呢，打「烏」呢，打「鶯」呢？腦袋搖幌着，打「燕」吧！丟下十塊錢，但是開出來是「雁」，那個開莊的拿出古本來對證，笑咪咪地……</p>
<p>在舞廳，沒有踏進這燈光變幻的魔窟時，有些人們爲門前的那個　子老虎機器吸引了。雖然，有着禁令，但，這個「老虎」還在這黑暗的角落伸着舌子，人們投入角子，香蕉……檸檬……橘子……蘋果在玻璃條裏　幻，使得眼光模糊了……</p>
<p>春節在上海，是法着蒙脫卡羅的麻醉風！</p>
<h3>爆仗</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>乒！乓！</p>
<p>驀地，衝破子夜的沉寂，來了這麼突擊似的兩下。幾乎在同時，火花照亮了暗昧的夜空。</p>
<p>乒！乓！</p>
<p>一個剛死滅，一個可又開出燦爛的花。那聲，那光，有如霹靂，有如閃電。雖然只是一刹那，對於這盲啞的世界，却是多麼可珍貴呵！</p>
<p>我默默地遙望着，傾聽着。我也聽到我的心的在跳，望見我的血的奔流了。</p>
<p>這時，什麼地方又轟響起來：劈拍，劈拍，劈拍！……我遺憾我竟不能看見那團烈火。但是不見也好，反正從那陣不斷的速響中，我更能體會到那燃放者的對未來的希冀，對新生的渴望。</p>
<p>第二天，我終於去買一點鞭砲來。</p>
<p>對於爆仗，我似乎特別喜愛小的。看呵：道些給編在一起的小傢伙，瞧着那麼木訥的！當我把它們懸掛在竿頭，擦亮一根火柴，爇着它們的一個時，它們可不再是那麼軟弱，馴服的了。有如一隊激怒了的羣衆，環境迫使它們按捺不住心頭的沈重，充分發揮出對遭際的仇恨和報復。看它們：掙扎，激動，鬥爭！這在它們各自成一個時，是只會閃出一點火星，一下抖動，一股輕烟的。而現在，它們多像一架機關槍呀！</p>
<p>好久沒有聞到的火藥味，道時重又鑽進我的鼻孔來。我的眼請爲那股硝烟燻得撩花了。我彷彿又佇立在街上，成百輛的車子打我的身邊駛過去，那些車子上就散發着這樣的火藥味，還夾雜着歡欣的喊叫。道直使我跳蹦了三天！……</p>
<p>爆聲漸漸的變得細碎了。地上是一堆還出着烟的餘燼。我終於帶着肯定的樂觀和高興放了一早晨的鞭砲。自然，我的心情還有若干「保留」，保留給不久的將來的那「節日」！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>當菜館或旅館茶房的人，對於世界上一切詭秘無恥的勾當，還會有什麼不知道的？秋海棠才騰進王大奶奶留下的雅座，兩個西崽便一起退出去了，雖然其中有一個曾經向那打扮得混身珠光寶氣的女主人投過一個含有邪意的眼風。</p>
<p>「喲！吳老板，這麼冷的天氣，頭上爲什麼不戴頂帽子呢？」王大奶奶很嬌媚地　定着秋海棠說，一般濃烈的脂粉香，直衝衝進對方的蠱觀。</p>
<p>這雖然不是秋海棠所預料到的，但看這情形，也就明白了。</p>
<p>「怎麼不見七爺呢？」他想回頭去問榮奎，可是這個功成身退的跟包先生，早就走得不見影蹤了；他不由窘得臉上一陣緋紅，立刻就想退出去。</p>
<p>但王掌櫃的媳婦怎麼能讓他走呢？</p>
<p>「我給你把大氅卸下來吧！」她爽快走到了秋海棠的身邊來，伸出一雙粉嫩的手，—一雙從沒有做通什麼有益於人的事的手—眞的就想給他卸下那件皮大氅</p>
<p>王一樣白的臉龐，鮮紅的嘴脣，加上富於磁性的媚笑，和那樣溫柔的說話，幾乎就要把這一個二十多歲的靑年藝人融化了。</p>

<h3>If the Lend-Lease Act Passes, the U.S. Will Take Over Pacific Routes; Simultaneously Researching Extensive Economic Warfare Plan to Counter the Axis Powers' Attack on Britain and Threat to the Far East</h3>
<p>Washington: House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom stated yesterday after meeting with British Ambassador Halifax that he had declared to the British Ambassador that the Lend-Lease Act would definitely pass the House without much change. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington: According to Senator Nye, he knows that once the Lend-Lease Act is passed, the first step for the United States will be to take over British shipping routes in the Pacific, so that Britain can focus on routes in the Atlantic. He also stated that he believes this action does not violate neutrality. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt and his advisors are currently studying an extensive and costly economic warfare plan to counter the Axis powers' attack on Britain in mid-1942. This plan includes several countries on four continents. Observers in Washington believe that if President Roosevelt's Lend-Lease Act passes smoothly, the plan will soon be submitted to Congress. The United States will invest huge funds and interests in this plan to break the Axis powers' war machine by blockading Germany's supply of oil, copper, cotton, and minerals. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of the Navy Knox told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that he was very concerned whether U.S. aid could reach Britain in time. When Knox was urging the Senate to quickly pass the Lend-Lease Act, isolationist leader Nye asked, "If the crisis that is expected to come soon materializes, can we save Britain in time?" Knox replied, "I honestly don't know. I am extremely anxious." Nye continued to speak about the naval power that the Axis powers could have after winning and asked, "Are you sure there is danger?" Knox replied, "I am sure there is danger. Do you think that after the Axis powers win, they can ignore us?" Nye said, "I believe the Axis powers will not ignore us, because they will be forced to deal with domestic suffering, famine, and minorities ready to revolt." Knox said, "Have you ever heard of a victorious country retreating when there is still something to gain?" Nye asked, "Do you think there is a danger of the enemy attacking the United States through Canada?" Knox replied, "The danger always exists. The base in Newfoundland puts the border of Detroit, USA, within its range." Nye then asked if the British Navy and British islands are the most powerful defense line for the United States. Knox replied, "Yes." Nye continued to ask, "But you think that even if we try our best to build our defenses, we may not be able to make them stronger?" Knox said, "I don't hold that view. This is why I support this Lend-Lease Act. Even if we can't recover a dollar, I should help it. I think spending money like this is saving money." (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of the Navy Knox told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that if the United States is forced to face the Axis powers alone, then "the United States may be outnumbered." He also stated that once Britain fails, Germany will have 700 times the convenience of the United States in terms of shipbuilding. However, he is not afraid of Germany immediately invading the U.S. coast, as Germany may first seek to establish a base in South America, as he said on Friday. Senator Nye, a Republican isolationist from North Dakota, asked, "If the Axis powers attack the Western Hemisphere, Japan is restricted by the war in China and cannot be of significant service." Knox replied, "Japan's navy is no small loss to the United States." Knox said that Japan controls the seas surrounding China, but he would not predict what kind of work Japan would undertake because "the current world situation" is extremely complicated. Nye asked, "Do you think there is a danger of the Axis powers jointly attacking us?" Knox said, "I can affirm it. Why do you think that they, having such power, can let us go?" Senator Connally, a Democrat from Texas, asked, "After Britain fails, will the Axis powers and Japan threaten us?" Knox said, "Japan is also part of the Axis powers." Senator Barkley, a Democrat from Kentucky, asked, "After the Axis powers achieve victory in Europe, will they increase the chances of victory in Asia?" Knox replied, "I think so." Barkley also asked if Germany and Italy will help Japan in the war against China. Knox said, "They have already said so." (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington: Representative Pepper, a Democrat from Florida, suggested to the U.S. Congress yesterday that Congress should listen to President Roosevelt's "wartime plenary powers issue to deal with the terrible crisis we are currently facing." He said, "Congress does not truly understand the severity of the crisis." He proposed that Congress should authorize the President to launch general national defense matters and abolish all restrictions that hinder national defense equipment and national debt.

<h3>U.S. Young Republicans Pass Resolution Supporting Aid to Democratic Countries</h3>
<p>Des Moines: The U.S. National Young Republicans held their annual meeting here yesterday and passed a resolution by a vote of 205 to 165. The resolution advocates that the United States provide military and economic assistance to democratic countries to the greatest extent possible without participating in the war. This action by the Young Republicans has shattered the threat of opposition from Republican presidential candidate Wilkie, who supported aid to democratic countries. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Kimmel Takes Office as Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Navy, Watching the Dangerous Situation and Completing His Mission with Absolute Readiness</h3>
<p>Honolulu: General Kimmel officially succeeded General Richardson yesterday as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy. General Richardson said at the time of his retirement, "The future is not a smooth road, and there is much to be done." However, he said that the U.S. sailors and fleet can be used and can complete the mission under any dangerous situation. Kimmel replied, "I really don't need to say much. The people of the country should know that the days to come will be busy days. We will continue to focus our attention so that we can complete any task with absolute readiness." At that time, seventeen generals boarded the flagship "Pennsylvania" in the sound of bugles. The Navy Band played "The Navy Admiral's March" for each general. The Navy also fired cannons to salute. The generals were wearing white uniforms and not full dress uniforms. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington: The U.S. Navy Department released 126 tons of stored tungsten yesterday for loan to the steel industry to solve the industry's temporary shortage and increase the production of high-quality steel. The Navy Department stated that the shortage of tungsten ore was affected by the three-month closure of the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Although the road has now been opened, there are still no new goods arriving. However, the tungsten lent out this time can only be used by the steel and copper industries for one week.

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Makes Outrageous Remarks, Warning the United States That the U.S. Lacks Raw Materials and Is Not Conducive to War with Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Mutō, a commentator for the Hōchi Shimbun, recently published an article in the newspaper advising the United States to be careful not to offend Japan. The article stated that hundreds of American people are freezing to death on the streets, and the United States lacks major raw materials. In the war in the Pacific, the United States will collapse. Mutō said, "In New York in midwinter, the weather is severe, and often about 500 people freeze to death in one day. The only thing they can rely on to keep warm is wool. If the source of wool in Australia is cut off, then the Americans can only die. Tungsten and other important industrial raw materials that the United States relies on from foreign countries are even more unnecessary to mention. The United States should understand that the world war that the country wants to provoke is no different from its own death penalty." Mutō said that the current attitude of the U.S. government towards Japan is to cause the United States and Japan to fight. He said, "If a war breaks out between the United States and Japan, the United States will rely only on the Panama Canal Railway and motorways. The United States must mobilize all its strength to concentrate on manufacturing heavy vehicles. The rubber needed for this manufacturing is all imported from Southeast Asia. How to maintain maritime transport is a problem. The United States cannot do it." Mutō also said that regarding the waters of the Far East, how the United States wants to avoid the crisis of collapse is possible. He said, "We want to tell the United States that Japan has no intention of dominating the western Pacific. What Japan seeks is only the natural resources necessary to maintain its national destiny. Japan does not deny the United States the freedom to obtain what it needs, because Japan also needs these raw materials. Narrow-mindedness and arbitrariness are only possessed by Americans. If the United States is generous and willing to reconsider its attitude, willing to cooperate with Japan, and agree to determine the scope of obtaining natural resources in the Western Pacific, then the tragedy of the Pacific, which is unfortunate for all mankind, can be avoided. An urgent crisis is waiting for us. What is hanging over Japan and the United States is a sharp sword hanging by a thin thread. This is our loyal advice to the United States."

<h3>U.S. Army and Navy Departments Strictly Guard Against Spies and Suppress Sabotage Activities</h3>
<p>Washington: The Army and Navy Departments are now implementing terrifying suppression measures to reduce the chances of espionage and sabotage activities. All officials and employees wear badges, and the badges bear the person's name and photo. Those without badges must be strictly inspected, and their movements in the office must be monitored. All offices are not allowed to have any lingering or peeping activities. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Opens New Far East Route</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet Union will open new airlines in the Far East. Regarding this matter, Molokov, Director of the Soviet Civil Aviation Administration, told reporters, "In recent years, civil aviation in the Far East has greatly developed. Several lines have connected the coastal areas of Khabarovsk and remote areas. At present, the Khabarovsk-Okha (on Sakhalin Island), Khabarovsk-Nikolaevsk, and Khabarovsk-Alexandrovsk lines have smooth and uninterrupted civil aviation. At the same time, the new Khabarovsk-Petropavlovsk line (2,200 kilometers long) has also recently begun transporting goods and passengers. Last year, Soviet civil aviation personnel completed 1,342,010 kilometers of flights in the Far East. This year, the Khabarovsk-Osipenko line will be added." (TASS, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japan Exhausts Resources and Intensifies Control</h3>
<p>Tokyo: After tomorrow's cabinet meeting approves, the Minister of Finance will submit a revised Foreign Exchange Control Law bill to the Diet. Its main purpose is to rectify the current control on the basis of war, because the current control has been repeatedly revised, although it is suitable for peacetime, but since the European war and especially after the establishment of the Tripartite Pact, the international situation has undergone drastic changes, so it is still not completely applicable. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>U.S.-Soviet Trade Relations Remain Unchanged; Hull Opposes Reducing Exports</h3>
<p>Washington: The U.S. government tried its best to reduce shipments to the Soviet Union in the middle of this month, because the United States believed that exports to the Soviet Union were undermining the British blockade measures. British officials all said that even if U.S. goods stopped being shipped to Germany, there would still be Soviet goods shipped to Germany. Senior officials here said that conservative Americans generally do not agree with President Roosevelt's change in Soviet policy, so they all hope that President Roosevelt will take this measure, but Secretary of State Hull and his surrounding diplomats believe that stopping exports to the Soviet Union will deal a fatal blow to the establishment of friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.

<h3>U.S. National Guard Joins Regular Army; 5,000 Philippine Reservists Also Join U.S. Army for Training</h3>
<p>Washington: The Department of the Army announced yesterday that 20,000 National Guardsmen will join the regular army on March 24. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Manila: U.S. military authorities here announced today that 50 Philippine reservists will join the U.S. Army's Philippine team for one year of training. This plan was authorized by President Roosevelt. The 5,000 young people who will receive special training were selected from 120,000 reservists, all of whom have received six days of training in the Philippine army in accordance with the current conscription system in the Philippines. U.S. military authorities said that the 5,000 people should be carefully selected in order to select excellent members. This new army will increase the current strength of the U.S. troops stationed in the Philippines, with approximately 5,000 U.S. regular army soldiers and 5,000 Philippine team soldiers.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Henan Campaign</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese war has long been in a state of stalemate and stagnation, but in the past ten days, with the approach of spring, it has suddenly become active. Since late January, fierce battles have broken out everywhere in the entire Henan-Hubei war zone. According to a Havas report from Chongqing on the 30th, a spokesman for the Chinese Military Affairs Commission stated that this battle was one of the important battles, and the situation would depend on the development within this week. This is of course only a local battle, and Chongqing denied that it was a prelude to the Japanese army's spring offensive; however, at this moment when news of the Allied countries' joint offensive and the Chinese army launching a major counterattack are frequently reported, it is necessary to pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>This campaign began on January 24 near Kaifeng and Xinyang in southern Henan. Before that, the Japanese army had launched offensives in Jingmen, Yangzi, and Dangyang Zhongxiang in central Hubei. They invaded both sides of the Xiang River and the western foothills of the Dahong Mountains. On the morning of the 24th, the Japanese army used two divisions of troops to attack north from the three strongholds of Changtaiguan, Chushandian, and Youhe in northern Xinyang, and concentrated its main force along the Pinghan Railway. At the same time, they also advanced from the west of Xinyang in three routes to invade the foothills of the Tongbai Mountains. In Kaifeng in eastern Henan and Boxian in western Anhui, they harassed the east side of the Pinghan Railway. From the perspective of the Japanese military deployment, it can be confirmed that this campaign has a fairly important nature and is not comparable to the years of Japanese-used mobile warfare tactics or so-called "mopping-up battles." In terms of strategy, the Japanese army along the Pinghan Railway is naturally the main force, and its purpose is undoubtedly to open up the Pinghan Railway line; and the activities of the Japanese army in central Hubei, eastern Henan, and even the border between Henan and Hubei are all used to contain the Chinese army's reinforcement or mobilization. As of the time of writing, except for the Japanese army in central Hubei who were driven out earlier, on the Henan-Hubei border, after several days of fierce fighting, the Japanese army in the triangular area of Xinyang, Queshan, and Tongbai is also being surrounded by the Chinese army. Only the main force along the railway line, after fleeing to Zhumadian, divided into two routes to peep into Xiping and Wuyang on the left, and Runan and Shangcai on the right. On the front, the two armies are confronting each other on both sides of the Ru River. In recent days, the Henan army has gathered in western Henan and deployed closely. It is difficult for the Japanese army to avoid repeating the mistakes of the previous Hubei-Hunan campaign.</p>
<p>The central Henan Plain, the main battlefield of this campaign, occupies a crucial position in the north, south, east, and west, and has historically been contested by military strategists in China. Since the end of the Xuzhou campaign in the spring of 1938, which ended the second phase of the first period of the Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese army's original intention was to capture Wuhan along the Pinghan Railway from northern and eastern Henan, but because of the Yellow River breach, which flowed from northeast of Zhengzhou directly to the Huai River Basin, forming an insurmountable natural moat, the Japanese army had to detour along the Yangtze River and the border between Anhui and Hubei to advance towards Wuhan, paying twice the price. After Wuhan and Guangzhou were successively abandoned, the Japanese strategy hesitated, lost its center of gravity, and always hovered between continuing to invade inland and ensuring the occupied areas; and the attempt to open up the trunk line from Beijing directly to Guangzhou, after several failed attempts, was temporarily shelved. This area of the central Henan Plain has not been fought for nearly two years. Now, after many deployments, the Japanese army suddenly adopted an offensive. Although this happens to be the Japanese political season, it should not be regarded merely as boasting about "war achievements" to the Diet in order to pass the military budget and the General Mobilization Law amendment. Its more important intention is to open up this trunk line running through the Central Plains, occupy an area that controls the key points of east, west, north, and south, in order to "freeze" the military in China, "build" the occupied areas, and indirectly also be a necessary preparation for transferring strength and engaging in southward advance. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has repeatedly revealed a breath of peace in the Diet recently. This is a political anesthesia for the Diet, that is, for the general Japanese people, and a smoke screen, and it is not enough to be regarded as a peaceful offensive against China; because with its clarity, it knows at least that during Japan's continued aggression in its various forms, it will definitely not get peace. Japan does want to pull two muddy feet out of the Chinese battlefield, but to pull out one, it must also rely on the remaining strength to make a final attempt; and the recent large-scale offensive in southern Henan is a manifestation of this attempt.</p>
<p>The southern Henan campaign is still in progress and has not come to an end. Regardless of how the results advance or retreat, they are only partial advances or retreats; China will reap more or less of the results of the war of attrition, but Japan will not fulfill its desire to pull out two or one muddy feet. Of course, China this year will not be satisfied with merely causing the other side to wear out; what is a pity is that the lack of heavy military equipment hinders the implementation of a full-scale counteroffensive. Even in this southern Henan campaign, the Japanese army on all lines failed to succeed. Only the main force along the railway line was able to make some progress. The Chinese army also had to use flexible mobile warfare tactics to deal with it. Undoubtedly, this is due to the disparity in the equipment of the two sides. Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper strongly argued that the United States' aid to China and Britain must be carried out quickly and seize the opportunity. It is hoped that the United States Congress can learn a profound lesson from the ongoing Sino-Japanese campaign.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Near Su County for Several Days; Chinese Army Captures Strongholds; Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Casualties in Chinese Encirclement and Annihilation; More Than a Thousand Japanese Troops Invaded Westward in Wen County Without Success</h3>

The three-country committee (obviously including Japan) has now been formed to handle any incidents that may occur between the two countries during the ceasefire period. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Mediation of War – Prelude to Southern Advance</h3>
<p>Saigon – A certain neutral diplomat told the Associated Press reporter tonight that Japan is planning to consolidate its position in southern Vietnam in order to use the area as a "springboard" for taking action against the Dutch East Indies or Singapore. The neutral observer also stated that although Japan's plans are already obvious, he cannot say whether their primary purpose is to deal with the Dutch East Indies or Singapore. (Saigon's newspaper censors deleted the details of this plan.) It is believed that the Japanese must have indicated their intentions to Tokyo or the Vichy French authorities. The full content of the Japanese plan may be revealed during the Tokyo peace talks between Thailand and Vietnam. Furthermore, it was officially announced tonight that the head of the Vietnamese government cabinet, Gao Diyi'er, may be appointed as the chief representative of a five-member delegation to participate in the upcoming Tokyo peace talks. In addition to Gao Diyi'er, the other representatives of the delegation will be officials from the Lu Fu Party and government officials. All representatives will go to Japan this week. It is reported that the Vichy government may send the French Ambassador to Japan, Henry, and the head of the French economic delegation, Bin, as Vichy representatives to the peace conference.

(1st Havas)</p>
<p>Rome – The "Rome Popolo" newspaper published a commentary yesterday criticizing the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire agreement, stating that Japan's mediation this time is a prelude to armed intervention in the Singapore area. The Fascist mouthpiece stated that Japan's mediation is fully in line with the provisions of the Tripartite Pact. It also stated that Japan's rule of "Greater East Asia" has been publicly recognized. The newspaper said, "The result of Japan's mediation of the conflict has made the Japanese Empire's hegemony in Greater Asia recognized by the world. This is purely as stipulated by the Tripartite Pact. Japan's mediation and interference are not only the realization of the overall sphere of influence of the Axis powers, but in reality, it is the precursor to Japan's armed intervention in the Singapore area, or even the encirclement of that naval base." (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<p>Vichy – Colonial Minister, Rear Admiral Pelaudong, recently issued a public statement stating, "The Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire agreement has been signed and established in Saigon. Detailed regulations have been added regarding the cessation of military actions by both sides, especially the simultaneous withdrawal of troops. Even aerial activities of both sides must be subject to limited restrictions in the future. Not only that, but in order to achieve a practical resolution of past disputes, both sides shall continue talks within a short period of time." (1st Havas)</p>
<p>France Attempts to Save Southern Vietnam</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to Hong Kong Chinese sources received here, the French authorities in Vietnam have sent representatives to Singapore to discuss plans to enable southern Vietnam to resist Japanese oppression.

<h3>Abundant Production of Tin, Antimony, and Tungsten Minerals</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to reliable sources, the production of tin, antimony, and tungsten in China in 1940 increased by 50% compared to 1939. Yunnan Province has now established the Yunnan Tin Industry Company. The original Yunnan Provincial Government Tin Smelting Company and the Tin Mine Exploration and Engineering Office of the Resources Committee have all been merged into it. Jiangxi and Hunan provinces also have new plans for antimony and tungsten mining and smelting. It is expected that the output of the three minerals this year can be doubled compared to 1939. It is known that tin, antimony, and tungsten are valuable minerals for China to exchange for foreign military supplies and repay foreign debts during the war of resistance, so the government spares no effort to develop them. Antimony and tungsten have also been transported abroad by airplane several times. (1st Havas)</p>

<h3>Japan to Further Reduce Gasoline Consumption Quotas – Private Cars May Become Useless</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Tokyo News: The Japanese Jiji Shimpo recently reported that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department intends to further reduce the gasoline consumption quota for Tokyo in February. It is estimated that private cars can only use six gallons of gasoline per month. The monthly quota for trucks is divided into several types: normal is 31 gallons, medium is 24 gallons, small is 17 gallons, and the smallest is 5 gallons. Taxis owned by private individuals are 24 gallons, and those that pick up passengers on the street are 40 gallons. In addition, the monthly quota for trucks used for public transportation is also divided into four types: normal is 66 gallons, medium is 60 gallons, small is 37 gallons, and the smallest is 15 gallons. It is generally expected that the quota for March will be further reduced, generally one-third of the average monthly consumption in 1940. According to the newly set quota, it is practically impossible for private individuals to use cars. The Tokyo Taxi Streetcar Owners Association will have to reduce the number of vehicles in operation and increase fares, or it may have to change the car's engine to use other fuels such as charcoal or gas.

<h3>Rumors that Germany is Building a Secret Military Zone on the Northern Coast of France – Invasion of England is Imminent – But Denies Preparing to Use Poison Gas</h3>
<p>London – England is now preparing for the German side to carry out unprecedented and terrifying bombings at any time, but last night the London area and various parts of England were shrouded in dense fog, so the German side's activities in the English sky have been reduced to a minimum. According to informed sources, the recent fierce bombardment by Nazi artillery on the French coast shows that the invasion of England is only a matter of a week or a few days. It is generally believed that the three-hour German artillery bombardment of the Dover area is the initial step in the invasion of England. British officials also agree that the German invasion of England seems imminent, but they say that only time can prove whether the attack on England will happen immediately, or will be prevented by Hitler's generals. News from Vichy says that military observers say that the German side has been waiting for a long time to attack England, but now it is imminent. People here are paying close attention to this news. French military experts say that the invasion of England will be launched in early February. It is alleged that the Germans have established a secret zone on the northern coast of France, so news about German military actions in that area cannot be obtained. The British official's commentary on the rumored invasion plan can be seen in the remarks of a certain government official, who said, "Let them come, we have been waiting for a long time."

<h3>American Military Experts Predict that Romania Will Become a Battlefield – Bulgaria Intensifies Air Defense – Ministry of National Defense Orders People to Serve</h3>
<p>New York – Romania is Hitler's main source of oil, so it may immediately be drawn into the vortex of war. Some military experts predict that Romania may also become a battlefield. It is said that Romanian oil is a necessity for Germany, so Hitler's actions in the eastern Balkans are quite cautious. Although the Germans now tightly control Romania, they are still hesitant and dare not pass through Bulgaria to attack Greece. If Germany invades Romania, Britain will attack the Romanian oil fields. The loss of Romanian oil is a major blow to Hitler. If Britain has sufficient aircraft, it is easy to attack Romania from its bases in Greece. Romanian oil is not an indispensable item for Britain. The situation in Romania is favorable to Britain in this regard, and Hitler has not yet acted because he does not want to endanger this source of oil. However, observers say that Romania will eventually become a battlefield, and it may happen immediately. (2nd International News Agency)</p>

<h3>British Newspapers Highlight the Crisis in France – Saying that Germany Will Occupy the Entire Territory of France</h3>
<p>London – The Sunday newspapers here all published articles detailing the crisis in Vichy. The Sunday Dispatch reported that Germany may suddenly occupy the entire territory of France in order to threaten Britain in the western Mediterranean. The newspaper's New York correspondent said that people in Stockholm all believe that the fierce attacks on Vichy by the Paris newspapers are a preparatory stage for the German occupation. The Sunday Times diplomatic correspondent believes that the final result of the correspondence between Hitler and Pétain may be announced in the next few days or even hours. The wording of the Paris newspapers under German control yesterday was tantamount to a German ultimatum. The newspaper's editorial also pointed out that Hitler's true desire is to obtain the remnants of the French navy and the naval bases of Toulon and Brest. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<h3>New French Party Appears in Paris – Advocating French-German Cooperation</h3>
<p>Paris – The New Unified Party, the National People's Unified Party, was established in Paris. Yesterday afternoon, the party first invited the public to join the party on a French radio station, opposing the Vichy government's dilatory policies. At 7:00 last night, the famous French journalist Fontaineaux detailed the party's political program on the radio. In the afternoon, the famous French writer Chardeau-Bellian gave a speech at the Charlet Palace on French-German relations. The party's declaration briefly stated that leaders from all walks of life in the occupied areas of France have held meetings to jointly study the situation since December 13 last year. The result is that the unprecedented difficulties currently encountered by France require an immediate national social revolution. The purpose is to restore French-German cooperation. The time is pressing. The mistakes made by Vichy have caused France to return to the state of subjugation at the time of the armistice. (2nd Sea News Agency)</p>

<h3>The Situation in Romania Remains Unclear – Authorities are on High Alert – Those Carrying Firearms Will be Killed Without Mercy</h3>
<p>Bucharest – Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu recently issued an order that anyone found carrying firearms privately will be executed immediately, and ordered the army to deal with the rebellion with extreme severity. If anyone gathers a crowd without authorization and does not immediately submit to investigation, they can be shot. According to previous orders from the Romanian Prime Minister, those arrested carrying weapons were not to be executed immediately, but it is heard that this leniency was misunderstood, so the Romanian Prime Minister has now issued this new order. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Bucharest – Although Romania is extremely peaceful in all parts of the country, the domestic situation remains unclear. The instigators of the recent popular uprising have not been captured. The famous members of the Fascist Iron Guard, who are responsible for this riot, are still at large and can be seen in the capital almost every day without any inconvenience. One example is the recently dismissed President of the University of Bucharest, Panaitescu, who is still a professor in the Faculty of Arts of the university. It is generally believed that the former cabinet associate, namely the leader of the Iron Guard, Sima, and his accompanying military officers, Lieutenant Iafen Fei and Lieutenant Braunneko, are still hiding somewhere in the city. For this reason, the Ministry of the Army issued a public statement today to strengthen security, briefly stating, "From today onwards, if the people riot again, the national army may immediately shoot those who refuse to obey orders. Anyone who possesses or carries firearms without government permission will also be killed without mercy." In addition, General Antonescu, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, has instructed the national army to take strict measures to suppress any violence. Several rebels who have been arrested have mostly been executed on the spot. As for the international environment of Romania, Germany seems to still support General Antonescu because it urgently wants Romania to restore peace. However, the Iron Guard has close ideological ties with German National Socialism, so Prime Minister Antonescu sometimes has no choice but to deal with the members of the Iron Guard who participated in the turmoil lightly.

<h3>General Weygand Gives a Broadcast Speech – Calling on the People of North Africa to Cooperate and Work Together for Revival</h3>

The speech mentioned the North African Economic Conference recently held in Algiers, saying that significant results have been achieved and all organizations that have been disrupted by recent events must be reorganized. This work is extremely arduous, and Paris cannot be built in a day. Weygand also elaborated on the great significance of the social actions in the national revolution launched by General Pétain in French Africa and the need for youth and labor organizations, and detailed issues such as the resettlement of refugees and housing, medical care, and social assistance.

It was also reported that Greek forces occupied a 1,500-meter high mountain north of Himara (on the southern coast of Albania), which controls the north of Himara. British aircraft heavily bombed Tepelene, causing great chaos among the Italian forces there. A fierce counterattack by Italian forces in the central battlefield was crushed by Greek artillery fire. The Athens Ministry of War announced that there were local battles in various places, and Greek forces occupied several key points, capturing many automatic rifles and old cannons, and capturing 270 Italian soldiers. The Ministry of Public Security announced that the internal situation in Greece was very calm. From December 29th to January 29th, Italian aircraft attacked Greece, killing 29 men, 21 women, and 17 children, and wounding 40 men, 35 women, and 15 children. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>London: According to a radio message from Athens, the important high peak, known as "1960," which was fortified by the government of Albanian King Zog, was captured by Greek forces after a night of fierce fighting. The Italian forces initially resisted strongly but were ultimately no match for the fierce Greek assault and retreated. A large amount of military supplies could not be carried away. Yesterday, Greek forces also achieved victory on the coastal front. The Italian forces launched a very strong counterattack, and the two sides engaged in extremely fierce fighting, the first major battle since General Cavallero took office as Italian commander. However, the Italian forces ultimately retreated in disarray due to excessive casualties, unable to regroup. Greek forces pursued, seizing a 5,000-foot high peak that controlled the entire area. Another high peak to the northeast was also captured. The Italian forces suffered considerable losses. As a result, all Italian counterattacks were defeated. Greek forces are now advancing steadily towards the objectives designated by their commander. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Vatican to Convene Council of Bishops</h3>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand: According to Paris Soir, once the war is over, the Vatican will convene a council of 2,000 bishops from around the world. Of the 25 cardinals, 19 have expressed their support for this. The main agenda items to be discussed at the council are: (1) the relationship between the Vatican and the emerging countries after the war; (2) the education of young Catholic believers; (3) the restoration of the family and the Christian social order; (4) the spiritual cultivation of humanity after the war. This is only the second time in the last 400 years that such a council of bishops has been convened. Pope Pius XII's intention is to prevent today's iron-fisted war perspective and tomorrow's famine and sin. Therefore, it is necessary to convene a council of bishops from around the world to show solemnity. Therefore, once this conference is held, its importance can be compared to the council convened in 1545, because what was discussed at that time was the Catholic reform in response to "Protestantism" (ie, Christianity), and what is to be discussed this time is an event related to the welfare of all mankind.

<p>Talks on the European War (33)</p>
<h3>Secrets of American Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Two famous American journalists, Joseph Alsop and Robert Kintner, collected various materials on American diplomacy after the outbreak of the current European war and compiled them into a book called "American White Paper," which explains a period of diplomatic history from the Munich Conference to the outbreak of the war, revealing many insider situations that the world does not know. The book has now sold to its seventh edition, and the following is an abridged translation:</p>
<p>At 2:40 am on September 1, 1939, the telephone on the switchboard at the White House in Washington rang. The sleepy night operator connected the line and heard a voice say, "Long distance call from Paris." Then another very sharp and rough voice said, "Can I speak to the President?" The operator recognized the voice of the US Ambassador to France, Bullitt, and transferred it to the President's secretary, Miss LeHand, saying that Ambassador Bullitt wanted to speak to the President. Bullitt was one of the two or three people who were qualified to speak directly to the President during the day or night, so Miss LeHand instructed, "Connect it." The operator then connected the call to the President's bedroom. The President had been having some restless nights in those days. Hearing the phone ring, he immediately sat up and picked up the phone by the bed.</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"It's Bill Bullitt, Mr. President."</p>
<p>"Oh, Bill." (Note: Bill is Bullitt's nickname)</p>
<p>"Tony Biddle (US Ambassador to Poland) just called from Warsaw and said that several German divisions have penetrated deep into Polish territory and are in fierce fighting. Several bombers have been spotted over Warsaw. He said that the phone suddenly went dead when he got to this point. He wanted to report to you before talking to me, but after spending half an hour, he still didn't get through."</p>
<p>"Well, Bill, it has finally happened. God bless us."</p>
<p>The two talked for a few more minutes. Bullitt asked the President to try to "try not to let them lay eggs on us," meaning to ask the President to send a telegram requesting the belligerent countries to avoid bombing unarmed cities. The two also discussed ways to evacuate American expatriates in Europe. Then the President said, "Bill, thank you. I'm going to discuss it with Cordell (Cordell Hull's nickname), etc.," and hung up the phone.</p>
<p>In those few plain conversations, the US government already knew that World War II had broken out.</p>
<p>The State Department's telegraph room is the nerve center of the entire department. The telegraph machines moved incessantly, reporting confidential information about Chamberlain and Daladier's hopes, hints from the German Foreign Ministry, secret talks with the Soviet government, new incidents in the Yangtze River Basin of China, and threats felt in the Balkans. These telegrams were translated into plain code, copied, stamped with the words "Confidential," and then transmitted to various offices throughout the day. First on the south side of the second floor, they were submitted to Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Welles, then taken upstairs to Moffat, the head of the West European Division, and finally, according to the source of the telegram, they were delivered to the "British," "Spanish," "Italian," or "Scandinavian" desks, where the responsible civil servants categorized and analyzed them one by one.</p>
<p>At the same time, at the White House, President Roosevelt received three large batches of telegrams every day. On most days, he also received special reports from ambassadors and ministers stationed in various countries, such as long-distance calls, special reports, and confidential airmail. He often used the day's intelligence as reading material before going to bed, making notes on the reports for processing the next day. However, if the issues discussed by the State Department were major, he was also reported at any time. At this time, he read various relevant documents, summoned Hull or Welles for talks, and conveyed his opinions in "memos," instructing the direction of the State Department's discussions. Then, the State Department used telegrams to instruct the envoys stationed in various countries to comply.</p>
<p>The 1938 Munich Four-Power Conference was the key to the change in American foreign policy. Before the Munich Conference, American world policy was mainly based on echoing others, but at the end of August 1938, US Ambassador to Germany Hugh Wilson reported that Hitler's ambition to invade Czechoslovakia was unshakable, and the United States adopted a positive and realistic policy. All hopes for peace were dashed, and the United States could no longer stand idly by.</p>
<p>By September 24, the relationship between Hitler and Chamberlain, Daladier, and Benes was extremely tense. The next day, the State Department and the White House were busy all day, and as a result, they drafted a telegram in which President Roosevelt appealed for peace, and sent it simultaneously to the governments of Britain, France, Germany, and Czechoslovakia at 1:00 AM on the 26th.</p>
<p>Hitler's reply involved the Treaty of Versailles, and on September 27, war seemed imminent. The President gathered the heads of government in his bedroom early in the morning for an emergency meeting to decide on two final steps: one was for the President to earnestly send a telegram to Mussolini in his personal capacity, asking him to mediate peace; and the other was for Welles and State Department Assistant Secretary Berle to rush to draft a reply to Hitler's telegram.</p>
<p>However, when drafting the reply, the issue of what action the United States should take was also involved. Initially, it was proposed to convene a peace conference, scheduled to be held at the Peace Palace in The Hague on September 29, with the United States sending an observer to attend. Then it was proposed that the United States would also be willing to participate in discussions on any economic issues parallel to political issues. But when these two drafts were sent to the White House, Hull strongly opposed them, and the President did not approve of them either. Therefore, it was decided to only advocate "holding a meeting in a neutral location in Europe" to discuss peace terms. Welles also spoke by phone with the ambassadors to Britain and France, asking them to inquire about Chamberlain and Daladier's reactions. At dinner time, the two ambassadors telegraphed back saying that the governments of their respective countries had expressed their agreement.</p>
<p>That evening, Hull, Welles, and Berle met with the President again. The President had been busy all day revising the telegram to Mussolini. When he was revising the draft reply to Hitler, news came that the German army would launch an attack that night, and the President was furious upon hearing this. But such news was still speculation and could not be fully believed. Time was of the essence, so he no longer argued over words and sent two telegrams directly calling for peace. The President signed them separately at 9:30 and sent them out that night.</p>
<p>What happened the next day is already well known to the world, namely that Hitler invited Chamberlain to a meeting, and Mussolini also acceded to the President's request to mediate, so the situation was temporarily saved from danger. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Japanese taxpayers held a general meeting at the Japanese Club at 2:00 PM on the 1st (yesterday), officially making a final decision to refuse to participate in the special taxpayers' meeting to be reconvened at the Race Course on the 5th to vote on the Municipal Council's 40% tax increase proposal. This news was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now heard that the reasons relied upon by the Japanese are approximately two points: (1) Japanese taxpayers believe that their views on the tax increase issue were fully expressed by Lin Xiongji at the special taxpayers' meeting held on January 23rd. Therefore, they unanimously expressed their support for the proposal of the Standing Committee of the Japanese Taxpayers' Association not to participate in the special taxpayers' meeting. (2) Japanese taxpayers believe that the next meeting of the special taxpayers' meeting will continue the discussion on the agenda of the previous meeting. Therefore, they believe that their participation is a "meaningless" act, and therefore take a blatantly refusing attitude. However, according to The Times, the Standing Committee of the Japanese Taxpayers' Association will meet in early next week to elect observers to attend the special taxpayers' meeting.</p>
<p>Arrangements Ready, Security Increased</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has maintained a calm attitude from the beginning regarding the interruption of the meeting on the 23rd, especially Chairman Fessenden and Vice-Chairman Allman. Even after the Japanese threatened not to participate in the reopened meeting, they were relieved to set it aside, believing that it would not form a major difficulty. They are still actively preparing for the reopening, and various measures have been prepared one after another. At that time, in addition to taxpayers entering the venue with green card paper carefully printed voting tickets, foreigners will not be allowed to enter unless specially permitted. The security aspect is more thorough than last time. Additional police officers are stationed at the two gates on Bubbling Well Road and the main entrance at the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Medhurst Road, paying serious attention to people entering and exiting. At the entrance to the meeting hall, police officers and sergeants of various nationalities will be stationed to check the voting tickets. Also, around the rostrum, because some Japanese taxpayers surged to the front of the stage at the last time in an attempt to demolish the rostrum, measures have been taken to separate it from the taxpayers' seats. Therefore, it will not be as convenient for taxpayers to go on stage to speak as it was last time.</p>
<p>The Proposal Is Expected to Pass Satisfactorily</p>
<p>The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the day after tomorrow. The agenda already discussed last time will not be repeated. The meeting will still be chaired by Consul General Hill, Chairman of the Consular Body, and Mr. Nash, Assistant Secretary of the Municipal Council, will serve as the secretary of the meeting. After the meeting begins, the chairman will first submit the amendment proposed by the Japanese to the assembly for formal voting. Then British taxpayer Mr. Liddell will propose a second amendment regarding the surtax case, stating that the estimated value of houses used by homeowners will be increased by 40% starting in January of this year, and the Municipal Council may also levy additional land tax on undeveloped land. This case was seconded by Audy. After Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden's defense, it will be submitted to the assembly for voting. Then the surtax issue will be completely resolved. Moving on to discuss the increase in license fees, Fessenden will state the reasons. After Liddell proposed and Mcguson seconded a request to amend to avoid increasing the license fee for milk sheds, the assembly will formally vote on it, and then the meeting will adjourn. It is expected that the meeting can be concluded within one and a half hours.</p>
<p>Borrowing Money Is Not Expected to Be Implemented</p>
<p>The total amount of spring property tax, etc. in the International Settlement is approximately 15 million yuan. It should have been collected at the beginning of this year, but because the Municipal Council is waiting for the decision of the Western taxpayers' meeting on the surtax case, it has not yet been collected. It was previously rumored that the Municipal Council intended to borrow money temporarily to make up for it, in order to pay the salaries of employees and interest on bonds in the past month. This statement cannot be confirmed, but according to observations by relevant parties, the postponement of this meeting is only for two weeks. In this short period of time, the Municipal Council is unlikely to experience serious financial difficulties due to the uncollected tax revenue. The surtax case, once passed at the reopened meeting the day after tomorrow, the Municipal Council will be able to collect the spring taxes according to the new tax rate from the next day. Economic difficulties will therefore not arise.</p>
<h3>Increasing Revenue Should Be Accompanied by Reducing Expenditure</h3>
<p>Expert's Suggestions</p>
<p>A famous economic commentator, Aless, published an article in the English-language The China Weekly Review yesterday, criticizing the Municipal Council's financial problems and offering many suggestions for increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. He stated that there are many people in this city who would rather see the Municipal Council go bankrupt than increase taxes, but they do not know that if the Municipal Council goes bankrupt, at least three major unfavorable events will occur. First, the burden borne by taxpayers will definitely not be reduced due to the bankruptcy of the Municipal Council. Second, if bankruptcy unfortunately occurs, it is precisely a good opportunity for the Japanese and a certain party to squeeze in. If this happens, the interests of this city will be harmed, and even the concession system will be shaken. Third, the bankruptcy of the Municipal Council will cause the only remaining commercial prosperity in this city to disappear. Based on the above reasons, Aless urged taxpayers to pass the Municipal Council's tax increase proposal. If it is passed because taxpayers agree, it does not mean that taxpayers sincerely support the Council's financial policy. The Municipal Council should live up to the public's expectations and implement measures to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Aless also made the following suggestions, saying that Shanghai people have clearly expressed their opposition to the method of indirectly and directly increasing the salaries of senior Municipal Council officials. Every time the Municipal Council increases the salaries of officials, the income of junior officials is extremely limited, while senior officials can often get hundreds of yuan. This fact is incomprehensible. I believe that the Municipal Council should stipulate in the future that after an official's salary exceeds a certain amount, their salary will no longer be increased, or they will be given allowances. In terms of reducing expenditure, the city's stock exchange is the best and most reasonable target for taxation. If we can levy a 2% tax on the city's stock exchange, we can get 2.5 million yuan a year, which is a considerable amount. Finally, the Council can also levy wharf fees on all goods transported to Shanghai. In addition, it can also tax vacant land without buildings.</p>
<p>Westerners' Criticism</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Westerner sent a letter to the North China Daily News, criticizing the impropriety of the Municipal Council's tax collection methods and demanding prompt improvement. It stated that when your newspaper commented on the assassination of Fessenden, it said that Fessenden's assassination was precisely when he was trying to pass the 40% tax increase proposal "for the greatest benefit of the whole society." We cannot help but have the following questions to ask: Can it be called "striving for the greatest benefit of the whole society" for the Municipal Council to repeatedly increase taxes on people who are already burdened with heavy taxes, causing prices to rise, while showing special favor to those who powerfully assist the Municipal Council, or those whose existence depends on the Municipal Council, and not daring to touch a hair of theirs? Can it be called "striving for the greatest benefit of the whole society" for the Municipal Council to tax important daily necessities and houses, while ignoring large businesses with great profits? From this, it can be seen that the current tax system is full of errors. If we tax commercial profits now, not only can the funds needed by the Municipal Council be obtained, but also the public's burden of house tax and increased license fees can be avoided. If the Municipal Council can further levy heavy taxes on gambling houses, stock exchanges, and prostitutes, then even land tax can be abolished. After all, all over the world, luxury goods are taxed heavily, while the taxation of the public's necessities should be done with caution.</p>
<h3>Merchant Corps Chinese Company Encampment</h3>
<p>On the previous two days (the 1st and 2nd), the Chinese Company of the International Merchant Corps, following the Translators' Company, held its encampment for collective training. Despite it being the beginning of the old lunar year and the weather being cold and windy, the regular members of the company still enthusiastically obeyed orders and arrived at the field. At noon on the 1st, the entire company, carrying luggage, gathered at the Public Works Department parade ground. First, Company Commander Major Chen Shixia, Deputy Company Commander Lieutenant Yu Xian'en, and other officers called the roll, reviewed the ranks, inspected uniforms, and gave speeches. Then, according to the predetermined order, they had lunch at 1:00 PM. After the meal, the courses began, directed by military advisor Huang Guohua and other senior non-commissioned officers. From 2:00 PM, Lieutenant Wang Tingkui instructed on the construction of sandbag fortifications. At 3:30 PM, barbed wire was erected. Tea and snacks were served at 5:00 PM, strategic exercises took place at 6:00 PM, dinner at 8:00 PM, a lecture on street fighting at 9:00 PM, and lights out at 11:00 PM. The entire company stayed overnight in the Merchant Corps Club gymnasium. The next morning, at 6:00 AM, they got up. At 7:00 AM, Lieutenant Zhang Tinggui demonstrated rapid-fire rifle practice. After breakfast at 7:45 AM, they marched to Yuanmingyuan Road for street fighting exercises. At 10:00 AM, there was a sand table lecture, with lectures given by Lieutenants Zhou Qing'en, Xu Shaomei, and Zhong Yuting. At 11:30 AM, they practiced with machine guns. At 12:30 PM, lunch was served. In the afternoon, at 1:00 PM, Lieutenant Li Yushu lectured on strategies for dispersing rioters and preventing riots. After the lecture, they returned to Yuanmingyuan Road for practical exercises. A tea party was held at 5:00 PM, and comedians Cheng Xiaoting and Guan Xianling came to the field to perform voluntarily to add to the amusement. It was not until about 6:30 PM that Company Commander Chen assembled the team to express his thanks before dismissing them. It is reported that the encampment was very successful in terms of performance and order. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Corps, Lieutenant Colonel Mann, and the former Commander, Colonel Henpei, both came to inspect and expressed their pleasure at the vigorous spirit and serious practice of the members.</p>
<h3>National Rice Shipped to Shanghai: Informal Contacts Made; Public Works Department and Others Exchanged Views</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports: "Mayor" Chen Gongbo hosted a banquet for the members of the Public Works Department's Food Supply Subcommittee, such as Sir Marshall and O'Connor, at the Cathay Hotel last Thursday. This meeting was of an informal nature, and it is widely believed that they exchanged views on the rice situation in the city. At the same time, although the value of legal tender fluctuates, the rice situation has indeed improved. There is currently a sufficient supply of rice in the city to meet the needs for the next few months, and a large amount of foreign rice will arrive soon. Therefore, the future of the people's food supply can be described as optimistic. The Public Concession authorities previously indirectly appealed to the Japanese authorities in the city to allow national rice to be shipped in without obstruction. It is reported that the Public Works Department has not yet received a definite reply after issuing this appeal.</p>
<h3>Oppressed Nationalities of East Asia Unite to Fight with China; Korean Volunteer Army Officially Established; Liberation to be Achieved Upon China's Victory</h3>
<p>According to the recently published "Millard's Review," Japan's decades of rule since seizing Taiwan and Korea in the Sino-Japanese War has only created hatred among the oppressed people. It is only today, with China's rise to fight, that these people have found new hope. The Taiwanese are all of Chinese descent, and their land has always been a part of China. Korea has always been a semi-independent Chinese tributary state. In recent years, oppressed and small nationalities of East Asia have sought a country to lead East Asia, and instead of going to Tokyo, they have gathered in Chongqing. A large number of Koreans are helping China in the war, and so are aspiring Taiwanese.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Provides Assistance</p>
<p>However, there is a slight difference. The Koreans' aspiration is to restore their homeland, and their nature is that of an ally of China. Taiwan is originally Chinese territory, and its nature is just like the self-defense of the soldiers of the Northeast. For the past twenty years, Koreans have had a secret government in China, which has gained the support of Koreans abroad. Acts of terrorism against Japan have been heard from time to time. The political leaders of these Koreans are now all in Chongqing. Three weeks ago, Chiang Kai-shek specially approved the formation of a Korean army to fight their oppressors on the battlefield with their blood.</p>
<p>Official Armed Forces Fight Together for Victory</p>
<p>In fact, Korean youths have long been mixed into the Chinese army to help in the war. A few days ago, a group celebrated its second anniversary. This is the "Korean Volunteer Army," which currently has three hundred members. In addition to war work, its task is to also focus on winning over Koreans in the Japanese army to help China. However, Koreans were previously unable to receive military equipment. Now, with government approval, they will be officially armed and renamed the "Korean Volunteer Army." However, these people are not fighting to restore the Yi dynasty (the Yi dynasty was weak and surrendered to Japan, which Koreans deeply hate). Their purpose is to establish a new independent and democratic country, firmly believing that they will achieve this goal with China's victory.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Cosme Has Indeed Returned to Shanghai from Vietnam</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China Cosme left Shanghai for Chongqing five months ago. During this time, Cosme stayed in Chongqing, the wartime capital of China. During this time, Cosme met with central authorities to explain the situation of the Pétain government and the French Vietnamese government regarding China. Then, he went to Chengdu to preside over the cancellation of the French consulate in Chengdu. On February 6th, he flew to Hong Kong from Chongqing on a China National Aviation Corporation plane. Then, due to the tense relationship between French Vietnam and Thailand, Cosme hurriedly bought a boat to Saigon to meet with Lieutenant General Decoux, staying in Vietnam for almost a month. Now that his mission is completed, he came to Shanghai on the French mail ship General Pershing. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, who inquired with the French consulate, the ambassador did indeed arrive in port at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. He is currently residing in his private residence on Haig Road and does not plan to go elsewhere in the short term, planning to stay in Shanghai for a long time.</p>
<h3>Legal Advisor to the French Municipal Council Still Vacant</h3>
<p>Since the legal advisor to the French Municipal Council, Dugue, was assassinated last year, his position as legal advisor to the French Municipal Council has, according to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired with relevant parties yesterday, remained vacant because the Municipal Council has not yet appointed anyone else. The vacancy left by Dugue is still vacant, and a successor has not yet been decided. The position of chairman of the French Concession Rent Mediation Committee is also vacant, and the committee's work has been suspended.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Burma Road Now Open for Postal Service</h3>
<p>The Kunming Post Office now has a batch of mail destined for Shanghai, Hong Kong, and overseas, loaded onto trucks and transported to Lashio, from where it will be exported via Rangoon. Afterwards, there will be several more batches transported and exported via this route.</p>
<h3>Most Workers at the Tushanwan Orphanage Reinstated; Dismissed Workers Are All Specialists</h3>
<p>Regarding the incident involving more than 500 employees of the Tushanwan Orphanage in Xujiahui, a labor dispute arose earlier due to demands for improved treatment. The orphanage initially agreed to cancel the original rice subsidy of $4.50 per month and instead subsidize one dou of Xian rice for adults and five sheng for children. The entire labor force was satisfied and resumed work. However, the orphanage suddenly changed its mind, causing the labor dispute to recur. It is now known that the arrested labor representative, Shi Jiaping, was released the day before yesterday. The orphanage immediately paid the dismissed employees two or three months' wages. The other employees, more than 420 in number, officially resumed work at 7:00 AM yesterday. As for the more than 80 dismissed employees, they have organized a group to appeal to people from all walks of life for sympathy, hoping that they will be hired. Among them are specialists such as typesetters, coppersmiths, carpenters, and carvers. They are now eager for people to hire them if needed. These workers all reside at Dawei Nong, Wu Daitou, Yujiahui.</p>
<h3>Small Island off the Coast of Fuqing Occupied; Shipping to Shanghai and Fujian Obstructed</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news yesterday, a small island off the coast of Fuqing in Fujian Province was occupied by the Japanese Navy in mid-last month, further obstructing shipping routes between Shanghai and Fujian. After the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of shipping in Zhejiang and Fujian on July 15 of last year, shipping between Shanghai and Fujian relied solely on this route, with foreign ships such as the Xinanna, Xin'anli, Yongfeng, Yongtai, Kailin, and Ma Le operating. It is reported that the Xinanna planned to sail from Shanghai to Fuqing last month, but was detained before it could set sail, causing the remaining ships to be idle on the Shanghai coast. It is also learned that the British firm Yilong Steamship Company in this port is seeking to restore the Shanghai-Fujian shipping route and has already sent the Shenyou to test sail to Sandu'ao in the Min Estuary.</p>
<h3>Prices of Medicinal Materials Rise Again; Burden on Patients Increases Daily</h3>
<p>Since the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded by the Japanese army, goods have had to be transported through roundabout routes. Most of the domestic medicinal herbs are produced in Sichuan and Guangdong. Since the seaports were blockaded, they have all been coming to Shanghai via Hong Kong. Recently, due to the rise in the Hong Kong exchange rate, the price has increased by 20 to 30 Hong Kong dollars per 100 catties, so the market prices have all increased sharply. For example, Xisha Mi Guangmuxiang has increased by 20% and 40%, and Da Fu Apricot Kernels have increased by 10% and 12%. The prices of goods from Sichuan and Yunnan are particularly high. For example, Chuan Bei, Huang Fu Kuai, and Musk have increased by more than ten times compared to the second half of last year. Hong Kong is also the top destination for Shanghai's exports. Since the Shanghai-Wenzhou shipping route was suspended, the annual decrease in medicinal materials going to Wenzhou has reached 30 to 40 million yuan. In addition, Danshen produced in Chuzhou has decreased in production, making it unable to meet demand. Therefore, the selling price has increased from 70 yuan per piece to 200 yuan, and there is a feeling that there are no goods available on the market. The prices of other goods have all skyrocketed due to the increase in the red plate. The prices of retail medicines have increased by an average of one-half, so the burden on patients has increased accordingly.</p>
<h3>Western Reporter Praises Hunan-Guangxi Railway; Vehicles Concentrated to Strengthen Military and Freight Transport; Staff Show Enthusiasm and Work Hard</h3>
<p>Ips Tan, correspondent for the English-language "China Press," writes: "Before the war, China did not have many railways. Since the start of the war, most have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, and a few have been destroyed by the Chinese army themselves. But one thing is worth noting: most of the locomotives, vehicles, and freight cars of the original railways have not fallen into enemy hands. Now, a large number are concentrated on the Hunan section of the Yuehan Railway and the railway from Hengyang to Guangxi. These two railways are now the center of free China's transportation and the remnants of the old railways, which are precious. In addition to transporting goods, they can also mobilize large numbers of troops at high speed to the main battlefields in three directions (one towards Wuhan, one towards Guangzhou, and one towards the Guangxi border). China has repeatedly won victories on these three battlefields last year, greatly increasing China's confidence in fighting, but at the same time greatly damaging the prestige of the Japanese army. Among them, the Hunan-Guangxi Railway was built and rushed after the start of the war, which is an amazing miracle."</p>
<p>Luxurious Sleeping Cars, Clean and Neat</p>
<p>The reporter traveled to the interior, passing through areas of fire and areas where there were no roads. The transportation was extremely difficult. One day, he suddenly arrived at the Chinese railway money south of Hunan and unexpectedly saw a miracle. After four years of hard fighting in China, everyone must think that the train must be broken and the passengers will be unbearable. However, the car that the reporter entered was the most luxurious sleeping car, clean and tidy, with all the facilities complete. Even the manager of the guard car was dressed in brilliant uniforms and full of spirit, making it extremely comfortable.</p>
<p>Vehicles from All Routes Concentrated Here</p>
<p>The reason for this is very simple: the essence of Chinese vehicles, such as the green express trains made in Belgium and the famous blue steel trains of Pinghu, did not fall into the hands of the Japanese army. They went with the army and are now concentrated on these two routes. At the forks of major stations, vehicles are parked and gathered like clouds, covering the entire view. The cars are all printed with the words "Beining," "Jinpu," "Jinghu," etc. A few are even marked with the words "China Eastern Railway." The original railway personnel all came with the vehicles, so at each station and on the train, you can see staff speaking different languages from all directions. Most of these people have gone through great hardships to rescue railway materials.</p>
<p>Hengyang Has Become a Transportation Hub</p>
<p>The car arrived in Hengyang. Hengyang is a city that has developed with the war. Its terrain is important. Three years ago, it was just a small city. Today, it is the main transportation hub of the country. From here, the main roads to all parts of free China radiate. No matter where a large number of reinforcements are needed, or a province or region is suffering from famine and needs assistance, or construction in western China needs machinery and steel, the way to provide assistance must pass through Hengyang. Because Hengyang is a new city, its appearance is different from the old styles of the major cities in Hunan. The streets are wide, and the shade is neatly arranged. Most of the people come from other provinces, so the language is not uniform. Railway factories and other factories are booming.</p>
<h3>Police Eradicate Opium and Gambling; Splendid Gambling Den Uncovered; Search of the Silver Palace Wine Shop Upstairs Lasted Three Hours; Gambling Equipment Plentiful, Opium Equipment Valuable</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports: The Public Works Department's Police Department is making every effort to eradicate opium and gambling in the Public Concession. Yesterday (the 1st) at 2:00 PM, detectives uncovered a magnificent opium and gambling den on the upper floor of the Silver Palace Wine Shop at 982 Fuxu Road. A large number of gambling tools were seized, such as roulette, apple betting, dice, chips, and dozens of tables and chairs, all of which were loaded onto trucks and taken to the police station. In addition, detectives also confiscated a large number of cigarettes, cigars, cash boxes, application forms for entering the den, account books, wine, and male and female uniforms for shakers. The detectives finished searching at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Opium and Gambling Intertwined, Magnificent and Splendid</p>
<p>As a result, not only was it discovered that it was a gambling den, but it was also found that this evil place, which supplied opium smoking, was operated by a gang of foreigners, occupying a total of six rooms. Four of them were used for gambling, and the other two were luxuriously equipped for people to smoke drugs. Therefore, detectives also confiscated a full set of opium smoking equipment, including three silver-inlaid ebony pipes, opium lamps, and ashtrays. Detectives also went to the drinking room of the gambling den and confiscated account books, wine glasses, soap, and towels. In a room behind the drinking room, large and small gambling tools were being manufactured and were also seized. At the time, there were eight people in the gambling den who were caught off guard and arrested. It is widely believed that after interrogation, they will implicate others. As for whether any foreigners were arrested, there was no confirmed news last night.</p>
<p>Six Places Uncovered in Half a Month</p>
<p>The police have been paying attention to this gambling den for more than a day and knew that it was engaged in small-scale gambling. However, after a thorough search yesterday, a large number of gambling tools were seized, and it was learned that the operators were preparing to expand the scope. It is reported that the gambling den uncovered yesterday was the most magnificent of all the gambling dens that the police have closed down in the past month and a half. Its furniture, gambling tools, uniforms, and silver-inlaid opium pipes are more luxurious than the equipment in gambling dens on the roads outside the concession. Since December 26 of last year, the Public Concession police have uncovered six gambling dens to date, bringing the eradication of opium and gambling in the concession one step closer to realization. The first gambling den uncovered by the Police Department recently was located on Jing'an Temple Road, and a Portuguese was arrested on the spot. Afterwards, gambling dens were successively uncovered on Gordon Road, Haig Road, Deyi Building, and Cangzhou Hotel. In addition, detectives from the Police Department's Narcotics Division also uncovered an opium den on Huaji Road, arresting two people and seizing raw opium and heroin worth 20,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Court Clerks Demand Subsidies; Resolution Possible in the Short Term</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration, in consideration of the poverty of judicial officials in Shanghai, has ordered that officials of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, and the Second Prison be subsidized an additional 40 yuan each month starting in October of last year. However, there was no clear order to issue this 40-yuan subsidy to clerks, guards, and wardens, so the clerks and others have risen up to demand equal treatment from their superiors, but this has not been resolved. Therefore, the clerks and others have decided to demand that their superiors follow the Ministry of Judicial Administration's previous instructions, that the president of the court can handle matters at his discretion based on local conditions, and quickly provide relief by subsidizing them all 40 yuan each month starting in October of last year, according to the example of subsidies for employees such as record clerks. Fortunately, the court and prison authorities deeply understand the hardships of the clerks and others, and it is expected that this matter can be resolved satisfactorily in the short term.</p>
<h3>The Identity of Ms. Samson, Who Jumped to Her Death</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reports: Last Friday, the 5th, a Western woman jumped from the Washington Apartments on Avenue Petain and died instantly. The French Concession Police Department has now identified the woman as Ms. Samson, 52 years old, originally from Stockholm, Sweden. She came to Shanghai in 1913 and lived at 104 Huanlong Road, making a living by teaching English and French. The motive for her suicide is still unknown, but it is said that the woman has been living alone for many years and feels quite pained.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Rue Massenet; One Thief Arrested on the Spot</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 8:15 AM, three robbers armed with weapons broke into 26 Rue Massenet in the French Concession and robbed the place. They then fled with the stolen goods. One of the thieves fled to the intersection of Avenue Foch and Chengdu Road, where he was chased by the victim who was shouting behind him. He was arrested by a constable from the Public Concession Police Department. A pistol and three bullets were found on the thief's body and were all escorted to the police station to pursue the accomplices.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Fetus with Inverted Features; Dr. Qu Explains the Origins of Development; Specimen Stored at the Sheng Sheng Hospital for Research</h3>
<p>On a certain day this month, a woman went to the Sheng Sheng Hospital at 57 Rue Sa po sei because she was pregnant and nearing her due date and her abdomen was hurting frequently. The hospital's director, Dr. Qu Shaohang's wife, Dr. Yao Yingnai, performed surgery to deliver a female fetus. Upon close examination of its face, its features were different from those of ordinary people. The nose was on the forehead, with the nostrils facing upwards. The eyes were below the nose, with the two eyeballs joined together, like twin lotuses just blooming. The eyelids were connected, like a goldfish's eyes spitting out. The ears were in the neck, just like a large mouth gaping open. Upon careful inspection of the mouth slit, there was no trace of it.</p>
<p>Scientific Explanation of Monster Formation</p>
<p>According to Dr. Qu, the common people say that monsters are formed by the spirits and ghosts that haunt them, and they are often ashamed and disgusted by them. However, based on the embryology of science, it may be a developmental disorder in the early stages of life in the womb, or it may be that the fetal body is dead, but the chorion and amnion continue to proliferate. What is called small to large is not large or too large, what is called short to long is not long or too long, what is called thin to thick is not thick or too thick, what is called solid to hollow does not become hollow, what is called simple to complex is not complex, what is called joining and separating does not separate, and what is called separating and joining does not join. What is there to be ashamed of? What is there to be disgusted by?</p>
<p>Strange Fetal Monsters</p>
<p>Throughout history, there have been countless types of fetal deformities, in a thousand shapes and ten thousand states. There are those with one body and two heads, those with two bodies and one head, those with one head and two faces, those without hands or feet, those with a head but no body, and those with a body but no head. These are all caused by abnormal development. However, the shape of this child is truly an unprecedented deformity in obstetrics.</p>
<p>Explanation of the Development of Each Part of This Fetus</p>
<p>The reasons for this development can be roughly explained as follows: the nose is originally located in the center of the face and is the boundary between the eyes. Now, because the lower part has separated and flipped upwards, the nostrils are facing upwards and the eyes are below the nose. The two eyes are originally separated left and right by the nose as a boundary. Now that the nose is upwards, the two eyes are joined together without separation, so the shape is joined but in fact separated. The ball is joined, so the eyelid is naturally connected. The entire part below the eyes does not develop, so there is no mouth or jaw. Since there is no jaw, the auricles on both sides naturally drag closer to each other. What is called shaped like a large mouth gaping open is a natural consequence.</p>
<p>Shape of Deformed Fetus</p>
<h3>French Public Bus Crushes Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Every morning, the French Tram Company sends public buses to the No. 16 Fish Market to transport fresh fish and vegetables and vendors to various small vegetable markets to serve the market. Yesterday morning at 6:59 AM, a French 22nd Route 818 public bus loaded with vendors, fish, and vegetables was traveling east to west on Avenue Edward VII. As it approached the intersection of Old North Gate Street, a man of about 50 years of age was crossing the road from south to north and was unable to retreat, causing him to be knocked down by the front left wheel of the bus, crushing his skull and causing blood to flow all over his face. The police arrived and sent him to the Guangci Hospital, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 3:00 PM. The police took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall. A South City pass was found on the deceased's body, with the name Li Mingbao, age 50, with no registered address, only stating residence in the South City, so there was no way to find the deceased's family. The police took photos and waited for the family to identify the body. The body was temporarily buried by the charity hall.</p>
<h3>Fire on Tangshan Road; Young Woman Burned to Death</h3>
<p>A stone gate house at No. 119, Huaxingfang, 326 Lane, Tangshan Road, Hongkou, Baoding Road, caught fire yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:30 PM, instantly emitting thick smoke and raging flames, spreading to the neighboring house at No. 117. When the fire was raging, a young woman, Qin Zhou, age 29, inside No. 119, which was where the fire started, was unable to escape and was burned to death in the fire, her head and face charred beyond recognition, a tragic sight. Later, the fire brigade drove to the scene and, after an hour and a half, first extinguished the fire by drawing water to the fire scene, and then dug out a female body from the rubble and sent it to the coroner's office for examination. The fire destroyed two stone gate houses.</p>
<h3>Deaths by Misadventure</h3>
<p>Tea Boy at the Stock Exchange: At approximately 8:35 AM yesterday morning, a man jumped from the window of the 7th floor of the Stock Exchange Building at 429 Jiujiang Road and fell into the 4th lane of the building, fracturing his skull and causing brain matter to flow. The Chinese constable No. 2007 from Lao Zha heard the news and rushed to the scene, urgently calling an ambulance to accompany him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly thereafter. It is reported that the deceased was named Lu Fengsheng, in his early fifties, from Cixi, and was a tea boy in the accounting department of the Stock Exchange. He was allegedly forced to take his own life due to financial difficulties. After the hospital transferred the body to the coroner's office for examination, it was coffined.</p>
<p>Yan Daoyi from Changshu: Yan Daoyi, a 49-year-old resident of No. 17, Lane 44, Rue du Père Huc, Changshu, had recently lost his job and was unable to support his family, leading him to take his own life by poisoning himself on the afternoon of the 31st of last month. At 7:00 PM that night, his son discovered him and sent him to the Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died at 8:00 AM on the 1st. His body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall, awaiting collection by his family.</p>
<p>Woman Suffering from Mental Illness: At 5:00 PM on the 1st, an unnamed woman, approximately 30 years old and neatly dressed, due to suffering from mental illness, was alone and incoherent in the middle of the road at the intersection of Avenue Paul Beau and Avenue Petain in the French Concession, laughing and joking abnormally. A patrol officer found her, took her to the police station, and sent her to the mental hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour for treatment, but she died at 11:00 AM on the 2nd. The hospital notified the police station, but as there was no way to contact her family, the body was taken by car to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for photographs, awaiting identification by her family.</p>

<h3>Scoto Cup: Chinese Despair - Yu Yu Also Loses to North Seston - 2-4, First Half 1-2</h3>
<p>The second week of the Scoto Cup featured four matches. After Tung Wah's crushing defeat to West Point and St. Francis Xavier's overwhelming victory over the Jews, the Franco-Portuguese rematch the day before saw the French prevail 4-1. The remaining match between Yu Yu and North Seston took place yesterday afternoon at Jiaozhou Park. Before the match, Yu Yu's chances were highly touted. Although North Seston was a Division A team, they were considered to be of lesser quality. Yu Yu, with ample strength and a complete lineup, had high hopes. Unexpectedly, in yesterday's match, they lost 2-4 due to overconfidence. Zhang Lin'gen and Jiang Chao, internal defenders, overstepped their roles to attack, leaving the defense vulnerable and resulting in a crushing defeat. They were eliminated, ending the Chinese teams' chances in the Scoto Cup. Tung Wah and Yousheng were eliminated earlier. The high hopes pinned on Yu Yu, the last remaining hope, proved to be a mirage. The semi-final week will feature only foreign teams: the French, St. Francis Xavier, and North Seston. West Point is considered the strongest contender, and the final week is expected to be a battle between West Point and the French for the championship. Yu Yu attacked first, but neither side scored in the first ten minutes. In the 13th minute, Wang Zhangbao committed a foul, and Kai Lu took a free kick from 30 yards out. The ball landed perfectly in front of the goal, and Ke Kelun headed it in, leaving Zheng Tongyu unable to save it, opening the scoring. In the 26th minute, Lai Liao committed a handball, resulting in a penalty. Sun Laojin successfully converted it, tying the score at 1-1. In the 30th minute, Ke Kelun broke through alone, with Zhang Lin'gen and Jiang Chao too far away to return in time. Ke Kelun scored from close range, ending the first half at 2-1. After the restart, in the 14th minute, Tie Funik launched a long shot that found the corner of the net, extending North Seston's lead. Three minutes later, Sun Huipei made a beautiful hook, and Wang Caigao headed it in (3-2). Unexpectedly, in the 20th minute, Ke Kelun broke through the center, making it 4-2 and eliminating Yu Yu. From then on, the Scoto Cup was out of reach for the Chinese teams. To seek revenge, they will have to wait until next year.</p>

<h3>Tung Wah Plays Host - Loses to West Point - Giving Away Three Penalties</h3>
<p>This was the first meeting between Tung Wah and West Point in Division A. Currently, Tung Wah holds the top spot in Division A with eight wins and two losses in ten matches, accumulating 16 points. West Point has also played ten matches, but has one more loss than Tung Wah. Unfortunately, in yesterday's match, Tung Wah, despite being in excellent condition, missed three penalty opportunities and suffered a 0-2 defeat. This resulted in a tie between the two teams in the standings, jeopardizing Tung Wah's chances of winning the league championship. The lineups for the two teams yesterday were as follows:</p>
<p>West Point</p>
<p>Bo'erbin, Hutelai, Weiketai, Luoliezhi, Keluoke, Shidengqie, Zhuolunzifu, Fangxueka, Weili Huate, Gelinbo, Nuogeluodaofu</p>
<p>Tung Wah</p>
<p>Qin Bigao, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Cai Shengmiao, Huang Kehou, Chen Yutian, Han Longhai, Dai Linjing, Gao Baozheng, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>West Point kicked off. In the 24th minute, a golden opportunity presented itself. When Chen Yutian crossed the ball, Weiketai, in a moment of confusion, raised both hands to block the ball. Referee Wu Shouheng awarded a penalty. Unexpectedly, Cai Shengmiao bungled it, sending the ball wide. The heavens were merciful. Keluoke forgot himself in the penalty area and touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a second penalty opportunity. Dai Linjing deferred to Cai Shengmiao again. Having failed the first time, Cai was extra cautious this time. However, he was overly cautious and kicked the ball straight into Bo'erbin's hands. Within five minutes, they had missed two penalties. The first half ended 0-0. After the restart, West Point played with vigor. In the fifth minute, Weili passed to Gelinbo, who relayed it to Nuogeluodaofu. He dribbled straight down the field. Li Ning allowed him too much space, and Bigao was too slow to react. The ball slipped under his waist and into the net. West Point took the lead. In the 35th minute, Zhuolunzifu broke past Zhuang Youren, and Qin Bigao failed to stop him again. Zhuo added another goal, sealing Tung Wah's fate with a 2-0 defeat. In the last five minutes, Tung Wah missed their third penalty, which was quite astonishing.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Establishes National Martial Arts Textbook Compilation and Review Committee - Openly Soliciting Teaching Materials to Strive for Improvement - Aiming for Popularization to Achieve a Strong Nation and a Strong Race</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) The Ministry of Education believes that Chinese martial arts have a long history of thousands of years, and the depth of its techniques is immeasurable. Practicing martial arts can not only strengthen the body and increase self-defense capabilities but also cultivate a spirit of fearlessness. The physical fitness and spirit of the people are the driving force for promoting all undertakings. Promoting martial arts is a crucial plan. Although martial arts have gradually developed in recent years, they have not yet become widespread. The reason is that there is no unified textbook, which poses difficulties in teaching. Therefore, the National Martial Arts Textbook Compilation and Review Committee has been established to openly solicit martial arts teaching materials, strive for improvement and unification based on scientific principles, and aim for rapid popularization throughout the country to achieve a strong nation and a strong race. Any martial arts experts who submit martial arts books that are deemed qualified by the committee will be publicly acknowledged in the newspaper and given a small reward.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Proposes Methods for Students to Pay Grain</h3>
<p>(Lishui Correspondent) The Zhejiang Education Department believes that public and private secondary schools in Zhejiang Province have had considerable difficulties purchasing food grains for students this semester. Recently, the schools have repeatedly reported that if measures are not taken to prepare for the next semester, the difficulties will become even more severe after the start of the school year, and they have requested solutions. After repeated deliberation, it is proposed that the schools conduct a pilot program this spring for students to pay grain as a subsidy to alleviate some of the difficulties. Personnel have been dispatched and principles for grain payment methods have been drafted. Grain payment is limited to boarding students, and the schools are instructed to abolish any student grain payment methods they have formulated themselves.</p>

<h3>Review and Prospect of Shanghai Industry</h3>
<p>— Yu Xielin</p>
<p>Shanghai's industry started very early and developed very quickly. Shanghai is the center of China's international trade, the hub of domestic finance, and has convenient transportation, serving as a collection and distribution center for raw materials and manufactured goods. Therefore, various industries have been established one after another. In the first half of the 24th year, according to the survey of the Central Factory Inspection Office, there were as many as 5,480 factories, accounting for more than half of the factories in the country. In particular, important light industries such as cotton mills, flour mills, and silk industries are concentrated in Shanghai. Therefore, it is appropriate to call Shanghai the industrial center of China.</p>
<p>The "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out, and the areas where factories were concentrated, such as Zhabei, Hongkou, and Nanshi, were all destroyed by artillery fire. The industry that China had painstakingly operated for decades and had begun to take shape suffered serious losses. According to various surveys, more than 2,000 factories were damaged, with total losses amounting to approximately 800 million yuan. This is truly an unprecedented catastrophe for China's national industry.</p>
<p>Abnormal Prosperity of Shanghai Industry</p>
<p>During the Shanghai War, all industries in Shanghai were in a state of stagnation. After the National Army withdrew to the west, Shanghai temporarily entered a state of uneasy peace. Consequently, factories in the concessions resumed operation one after another, and factories that had moved into the concessions from the war zone also sought out sites to start work. In the 27th year, the revival and development of Shanghai industry were significantly vibrant, presenting a prosperous scene. However, how could it rapidly recover its prosperity after the wounds of war? According to the situation at that time, there were approximately the following special reasons: First, after China's industry was destroyed by the occupation, the consumption of manufactured goods throughout the country relied entirely on Shanghai. Although the government authorities actively developed the interior, manufactured goods still needed to be supplied by Shanghai before the industrial base in the interior was established. Therefore, the amount of Shanghai manufactured goods transported to the interior through the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, as well as the ports of Hong Kong, was extremely large. Second, after Shanghai entered a state of uneasy peace, people from the occupied areas flocked to Shanghai, resulting in a surge in population and an increase in purchasing power, which led to the prosperity of all industries and created a special economic boom. The revival and development of Shanghai's industry was stimulated by this. Therefore, most of the factories newly established during the war were those that manufactured consumer goods. Third, the increase in population and the influx of capital were closely related, and a large amount of capital flowed into Shanghai from the occupied areas. Moreover, since the European War, floating capital from Hong Kong and other areas has also flowed in. As a result, there was an overabundance of floating capital in Shanghai. Generally, prudent capitalists, seeing the improvement in industry, either indirectly invested or directly operated emerging businesses. With ample capital, the development of industry was naturally easy, and the establishment of factories sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Fourth, the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates and the soaring prices of goods brought unprecedented profits. However, because the rise in prices could not keep pace with the rapid fall in exchange rates, there was a perceived need to replace imported goods with domestic products, especially for daily necessities. At the same time, the result of the plummeting exchange rates made Shanghai's prices lower than those of foreign countries, which promoted the export of manufactured goods. Based on these four factors, Shanghai industries all gained substantial profits and presented a prosperous scene. However, this prosperity was actually an abnormal economic boom. The soaring prices of goods were entirely manipulated by speculation, so Shanghai's general industries were in a dire environment. By early May of the 29th year, when exchange rates rose, the prices of general manufactured goods reacted sharply and fell, with cotton yarn and other items falling the most, and general industries suffered a severe blow. The abnormal economic boom of the past two years came to an end.</p>
<p>Developments in Shanghai Industry in the Past Half Year</p>
<p>Since May, Shanghai's industry has entered a state of decline, with some factories reducing production or even shutting down. This reached its peak in August. Although there was a slight improvement after September, it has not been able to completely recover from the decline. The current adverse environment has not improved. The environment and developments of Shanghai industry in the past six months are briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) Shortage of Raw Materials: The development of Shanghai's industry depends on a sufficient supply of raw materials. The supply of raw materials depends entirely on the surrounding provinces. Since the coastal provinces were occupied one after another after the war, the main resources of the occupied areas, such as cotton, silk, wool, wheat, tobacco, coal, iron, and copper, were all monopolized and controlled by the Japanese, and this became even more severe in the second half of the year. The amount that could be imported into Shanghai was extremely small. For example, China is a cotton-producing country. In the two years before the war, the output reached more than 10 million bales, which was enough to achieve self-sufficiency. The output in the 29th year is estimated to be around 8 million bales. The cotton production in North China has long been prohibited from export, and the cotton production in Central China has also been almost completely controlled. The amount that can be transported to Shanghai for consumption by cotton mills is very limited. Therefore, the survival of cotton mills depends on the supply of foreign cotton. The degree to which flour mills lack raw materials is even more severe than that of cotton mills. In August, the number of days each factory was open was only two and a half days. There was an increase in September, but it was only eight days. The tobacco industry's demand for tobacco leaves has always relied on the production of Shandong and Henan, but now it relies entirely on imports from abroad. Therefore, due to the insufficient supply of tobacco, the output of Chinese tobacco factories has been greatly reduced, only reaching 10% of the pre-war level. Since the establishment of the Central China Silk Association, the silk production in the occupied areas has been under unified control. Only seven factories have started operations. The prosperous situation of more than 10,000 silk looms before the war is unlikely to be seen again during the war. As for cotton mills, flour mills, and tobacco factories, they can use foreign raw materials to make up for the shortage of domestic raw materials, but the current difficulties make it difficult to achieve a sufficient supply of raw materials. This is not only due to the tight foreign exchange and the high prices of foreign raw materials but also the impact of the European War and the shortage of transport ships. For example, Shanghai's rubber industry has always relied on foreign raw materials, but due to the impact of the European War, the Malay Peninsula banned the export of rubber, forcing it to be in a state of suspension. Therefore, the raw material problem of Shanghai's industry will become even more alarming.</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Markets: The development of Shanghai's industry depends entirely on having good markets. Before the war, the prosperous Yangtze River basin was the main market, supplemented by North China and Central China. After the coastal areas and provinces of Central China were occupied one after another after the war, the commerce of the occupied areas had a monopoly phenomenon, resulting in Shanghai industrial products losing the good markets of the Yangtze River basin and North China. Although there was an increase in local demand and the development of Southeast Asian markets after the war, it is clear that the past prosperity was built on an unhealthy foundation. In early July, the Sino-Vietnamese traffic was cut off. At the same time, the atmosphere in Hong Kong was tense. On July 15th, the ports of Xiangshan, Wenzhou, Sandu'ao, and Fuzhou on the Zhejiang-Fujian coast were suddenly blockaded, and on the 18th, the Yunnan-Burma Road was also blockaded. The traffic between Shanghai and the interior was completely cut off. This had a very serious impact on Shanghai's industry, making the market for industrial products even narrower. This move exacerbated the industrial panic since May. Although the Yunnan-Burma Road was reopened on October 18th, the transport capacity of this road is limited and insufficient to solve the problem of product sales. Although the development of the Southeast Asian market has been quite successful since the European War, the increase in the export of Chinese manufactured goods is still limited due to competition from Japan and the United States. Therefore, in the past six months, the obstruction of freight and the lack of markets have resulted in an imbalance in production and sales. As a result, factories have had to reduce production in order to maintain operations. Although the sales problem has improved slightly since September, the market problem for products remains concerning before the aforementioned difficulties are resolved. Moreover, the Japanese are now intensifying their control, restricting or even prohibiting the import of domestic goods. Therefore, the future of Shanghai's industry is truly worrying.</p>
<p>(3) Speculative Monopoly: After the war, floating capital was abundant, and as a result of rampant speculation, the commodity market was completely monopolized by speculators. Speculative monopoly arbitrarily raised and lowered prices, resulting in market imbalances. Therefore, the failure of speculators in early May dealt a serious blow to the industrial sector. Taking cotton yarn as an example, the sales of local yarn actually exceeded the sales of foreign yarn by more than two times. In the three months of July, August, and September, the number of local yarn absorbed reached 140,000 bales, while foreign yarn only sold 40,000 bales. The absorption by speculators is all of a speculative nature. If the commodity market continues to be controlled by speculators, the imbalance of commodities will inevitably become even more pronounced, posing a serious threat to the future of Shanghai's industry.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>In short, under wartime conditions, Shanghai's industry faces increasing difficulties due to the control of raw materials and the obstruction of transportation. The future is predictable. As difficulties increase, the position of Shanghai's industry will inevitably weaken. After three years of active construction, the industry in the rear has begun to take shape and is now waiting for continued development to establish the foundation of China's new industry. The government authorities should encourage the transfer of capital to the interior and the establishment of new factories, so that Shanghai capitalists and industrialists can find a bright future and avoid being caught in an adverse environment again. For existing factories in Shanghai, proactive economic measures should be taken to maintain the production capacity of national industry, rather than letting them develop or decline naturally, to accumulate the strength of the national economy.</p>
<h3>Current Status of China's Insurance Industry</h3>
<p>— Mo Xinglin</p>
<p>The insurance business is largely divided into two types: life insurance and property insurance. However, life insurance only focuses on human life and is entirely savings-oriented, which is completely different from property insurance. Therefore, what I am referring to is property insurance (such as marine insurance, fire insurance, ship insurance, automobile insurance, etc.), and savings-oriented life insurance is not within the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Phenomenon of the Insurance Industry</p>
<p>China has had insurance companies since the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, with a history of forty or fifty years. The motivation was that China had established a China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at the time, and it was believed that foreigners, in order to compete in the shipping industry, had jointly stopped underwriting the company's marine insurance (including hull, safe arrival, water damage, etc.) to exert pressure. Chinese merchants then founded "Renjihe" and several other insurance companies to counter this. Later, several of them were dissolved due to poor management. When faced with huge insurance amounts, they still could not be fully underwritten by Chinese companies; they had to reinsure with foreign merchants, earning some commission and becoming nothing more than large brokers. Up to today, forty years later, although many insurance companies have been established in the meantime, with the prices of goods rising daily, they still feel that their financial strength is weak and they cannot break away from the shackles of foreign merchant companies and operate completely independently. To date, China's investment in the insurance industry is only a little over 20 million yuan. A table is as follows:</p>
<p>The Need for Expansion of the Insurance Industry</p>
<p>According to the table listed in the previous section, the actual paid-up capital of the insurance industry, including Chinese merchant companies registered abroad, is only about 20 million yuan in total (the Central Trust Bureau Insurance Department, which is state-owned, has larger assets and scale). It is obvious that such a small amount of capital is insufficient to undertake the development of the insurance business.</p>
<p>Let's take fire insurance as an example: For example, a steel-concrete warehouse stores goods worth 5 million yuan; this is a very common thing, right? Then its total insured amount is already quite large. Suppose it is a steel-frame building of eight or ten stories with a construction cost of two or three million yuan, then even the interior furnishings must all be insured against fire to be assured. However, how can our insurance industry with a maximum capital of 20 million yuan accept it all? The insurance companies' insured amount, within a certain range, "or refers to a circle within four surrounding roads, or refers to a warehouse constructed entirely of steel-concrete," only accepts a proportion of 7% or 8% of the actual paid-up capital; or the company has been operating for many years and has a considerable amount of reserve funds before it can consider insuring a little more. Then their insured amount is at most just over 2 million yuan, and the remaining half or even more than half must all be directly or indirectly reinsured with foreign merchant companies. The annual insurance premiums that leak out amount to tens of millions of national currency, which are carried away by foreign merchant companies!</p>
<p>As for marine insurance, there are many categories and numerous types; such as hull insurance (steamships are considered immovable property, so they are different from ordinary marine insurance), safe arrival insurance, water damage insurance, and even separate dock insurance and barge insurance. If a compensation issue arises, it is even more necessary to base it on academic theory, clearly identify his responsibilities to determine how to bear them. Explaining in detail is too cumbersome. Fortunately, readers can see the rest after looking at the fire insurance situation in the previous section. But the millions of yuan in construction costs for each steamship, and the fact that each steamship can carry goods worth millions, are both very easy to see facts.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the estimated insured amount that insurance companies can accept, that is, 7% to 8% to 10% of the actual paid-up capital, then the actual paid-up capital for operating insurance must reach 50 or 60 million yuan. Otherwise, it cannot be completely independent; the insured amount is even greater during times of emergency; so, excluding the existing capital of the current insurance companies, it is known that at least 30 to 40 million yuan can be increased, or even more. This may be a way to accommodate floating capital, right?</p>

<h3>Saturday - Bill Acceptance</h3>
<p>Restrictions Now Exist on Time of Acceptance, Creating Various Disadvantages for Customers</p>
<p>Since the banking industry began closing on Saturday afternoons, it has caused inconvenience for most customers. In reality, this practice began because of a bank run on a certain Saturday last year, when they were unable to cope in time. Learning from past mistakes, they implemented Saturday afternoon closures this year. It seems that the banking sector is only considering its own convenience and seeking security, without regard for the convenience and security of its customers and other industries. This is quite unjustifiable. Unexpectedly, the bill clearing time on Saturdays has also been set by the Shanghai Bankers' Association as follows: (1) Bills from member money shops must be submitted before 11:00 AM on Saturday morning; (2) Bills from banks and trust companies outside the clearing bank must be submitted before 10:30 AM; (3) Bills from other external entities must be submitted before 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Chinese banks, needing to entrust the association with collection, have further advanced the acceptance time for bills. It is rumored that some are even limiting the acceptance time to 10:00 AM, and any bills received after that will be credited on Monday's account. For example, if a customer deposits a bill from a Chinese bank or money shop into a foreign bank on Saturday, it will only be credited to the account on Monday. This situation hinders the circulation of bills, inconveniences customers, and even causes them to lose interest. Some are even forced to resort to cash transactions. For the sake of the absolute majority of bank depositors, if the banking sector cannot abolish Saturday afternoon closures, then the acceptance time for bills should be extended until noon. Banks have an obligation to accept bills on the day they are deposited during business hours (i.e., bills deposited before 12:00 PM on Saturday should be credited to the account on that day).</p>
<p>As for the bill clearing time among banks, since the banking industry jointly insists that Saturday afternoon closures are not for leisure but a necessary measure to prevent bank runs, the clearing can be postponed to the afternoon without being too late. It remains to be seen whether the banking sector will fulfill its duty to serve the public and accept checks during business hours to avoid causing losses to customers. (Shou)</p>
<h3>More Trading in Coarse White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat, with fluctuations of only a few cents. The guild's listed price for spot coarse white sugar was 24 yuan. Foreign godown spot price was 81.30 yuan. February 10th delivery was at 81.50 yuan, which then rose to 81.60 or 81.80 yuan. February 25th delivery was at 82 yuan. February 28th delivery started at 82.20 to 82.40 yuan, but later returned to 82.20 yuan. DY brand was at 78.50 yuan, B brand old stock was at 81.60 yuan, and HM brand local stock was at 73.50 yuan. Trading in coarse white sugar was more active, with little activity in other types.

<h3>Algorithm for Calculating Weekdays (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zheng Chaoqiang</p>
<p>(3) August 13, 1937 (Start date of the Second Battle of Shanghai): (13+2+37+9) ÷ 7 = 8 with a remainder of 5.</p>
<p>Thus, August 13th was a Friday.</p>
<p>Looking at the examples above, it is clear that this algorithm is accurate and convenient. Using this algorithm, we can find out the day of the week for any anniversary in this century, and we can also calculate the day of the week for our birthdays if they are in this century.</p>
<p>The principle of this algorithm is very simple. The month indexes listed above are easily seen to be the month indexes for 1900 used in the ordinary algorithm. Because a regular year has 365 days, which is 52 weeks and 1 day, then after a regular year, the month index of the following year should all increase by one. A leap year has one more day than a regular year, so after a leap day, the month index increases by one again. Then the index of a certain month of a certain year in this century should be the index of that month in 1900 plus the number of years from 1900 to this year, plus the number of leap days that have passed from 1900 to this month of this year. These three numbers are the three items in the formula above. If we add the number of days, then the remainder of dividing the total by seven should be the day of the week.</p>
<p>The above algorithm, without modification, cannot be used for other centuries, because the first year of each century, such as 1900 and 2000, does not have a leap year. Therefore, if we want to apply the above formula to other centuries, we must either change the month index or change the meaning of the remainder. For example, if we apply the above formula and month index to the 21st century, we must make the remainder of one represent Saturday, two represent Sunday, three represent Monday.... For example, January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, we must make the remainder represent Saturday, two represent Sunday, three represent Monday.... For example, January 1, 2000, was a Saturday, because (1+0+0+0) ÷ 7 has a remainder of one. This can be confirmed to be correct from the fact that New Year's Eve 1999 was a Friday. In this way, we can calculate the day of the week for any day thereafter.</p>
<p>When applied to the 19th century, the remainder of one represents Wednesday, two represents Thursday.... For example, November 12, 1866 (Sun Yat-sen's birthday) was a Monday, because (1213+66+16) ÷ 7 has a remainder of six.</p>
<p>The calendar was modified once in the 18th century. From September 14, 1752, to December 31, 1799, if the day of the week for any day is calculated according to the above formula, then the remainder of one represents Friday, two represents Saturday.... For example, July 14, 1789 (French Revolution Day) was a Tuesday, because (14+6+89+22) ÷ 7 has a remainder of five. Before September 2, 1752, every four years since the Western calendar had a leap year, that is, the first year of each century also had a leap year. Therefore, when using the above formula, the number of years should be the full number instead of the last two digits, and the number of leap days passed should be counted from the beginning of the era. The meaning of the remainder is the same as in the late 18th century, that is, the remainder of one represents Friday.... For example, May 13, 1240, was a Sunday). Because (13+1+1240+310) ÷ 7 has a remainder of three. According to the above, the day of the week for any important historical date after the Western calendar can be calculated.</p>
<p>At the same time, this algorithm can be used to obtain the month index for any year used in the ordinary algorithm, because the day of the week for the last day of a month is the index of the next month. For example, last December 31st was a Monday, then the index for this January is two; January 31st was a Friday, the index for February is five. Using the above formula, we can calculate the day of the week for the last day of each month this year, that is, we get the index for the next month. Now list the index for each month of this year:</p>
<p>Month: January February March April May June July August September October November December</p>
<p>Index: 2 5 5 1 3 6 1 4 0 2 5 0</p>
<p>Applying these indexes, we can use the remainder of the following simplified formula to find the day of the week for any day this year:</p>
<p>(Day + Month Index) ÷ 7</p>
<p>For example, this year's National Day is a Friday, because (10+2) ÷ 7 has a remainder of five.</p>

<h3>Rice Price Ballad</h3>
<p>— Sun Cheng</p>
<p>My friend Mr. He Tao Yi is erudite, versatile, and fond of chanting. When he served as magistrate of Huangyan in the second year of the Republic, the Zhejiang Province's opium ban was strictly enforced. The county's native opium was ordered to be completely eradicated within a limited time. Therefore, he often took a sedan chair to the countryside to personally investigate. He once composed a seven-character poem on opium ban in Huangyan: "Searching for opium flowers, imperial edicts fly, a small team goes to the countryside at dawn. Baskets turn with the road, approaching the hanging stream, the valley's horn indicates the magistrate's presence. (The customs of Taizhou are fierce, but quite afraid of officials, so the county official makes a horn sound to alert them every time he goes out.) Summit welcomes, not hindering, leaning on the carriage with a nod, the market's noise is just in time for the fair. Nine sentences and a half make up the mountain's appearance, clearing poison is a labor of heart, I thank you for composing the poem." After August 13th, he came to Shanghai to take refuge, still indulging in poetry and wine. Last year, when rice reached 40 yuan per stone, he wrote a "Rice Price Ballad": "My China is a country of agriculture, producing rice year after year. If you combine nine, you often have more than three, eating your fill and enjoying a bountiful year. This year the rain and sunshine are harmonious, the harvest is sufficient for glutinous rice. Why does the price rise step by step, a peck of rice costing over ten thousand? High-priced goods aside, the fair price reaches 30 yuan. Bitter are the small-scale people, relying on hundreds of coins in hand. Hesitantly they come to the rice shop, hesitating, not daring to approach. The rice merchant glares, scolding this pittance. Looking aside, he exchanges a few coins for a pancake. Silently standing in the crowd, the constable whips him. We are refugee guests, everything can be saved, but rice is the people's heaven. At this harvest time, eating with difficulty is already pitiful, how much more in the time of scarcity, when rice is truly worrying? Many mouths criticize the monopoly, what is the reason for the high price in the producing area? Who bestowed it? Obstruction of transport and harsh taxes. Have you not heard that the rice price in Hunan and Hubei is half that of Jiangsu and Zhejiang? At the Wuhu market, boats are tied together, all carrying rice. There are native 'rice paddy fields' (local saying refers to a small amount of land rent, called rice paddy fields). Now living on this isolated island, I raise my shoulders and chant, counting the rice." Recently, the price of rice continues to rise, reaching 100 yuan per stone. Rural farmers selling rice gain a lot of money, mostly indulging in extravagance and not knowing thrift. Therefore, he wrote a "Continuation of the Rice Price Ballad" to warn them: "The rice price soars like the sun at the top of a pole, people returning from the market are unhappy. Sheltering from the war on an isolated island, the prices of a hundred items rise, making life difficult. Rice and grain account for the highest peak, ten gold coins are only enough to buy a peck. Other items are said to be several times more expensive, the price continues to rise as if chasing. Market merchants originally seek only profit, but why is there no competent bureau to stabilize? Tightening the mulberry road, levying taxes everywhere, the Benevolent Hall buries hundreds of coffins every day. Only the simple-minded, self-cultivating farmers enjoy heavenly blessings, the income from the fields increases year by year, big meat and fat fish are enjoyed to the full. A single gamble of "Yunpu" is like Liu Yi's豪, a sparrow fight of hundreds of gold coins does not cause any concern. Rent and taxes are both in arrears year after year, selling grain and returning home with gold-filled bags. Alas, what are the difficulties of the city dwellers? Market vegetables are weighed by the ounces, worth fractions of coins. The same hard work all year round, how many pecks of rice can one buy in a year? Alas! The overall situation will be clear one day, the heavens will surely restore after extreme adversity. Supply and demand have a constant balance, market price adjustment should start with rice. Farmers, farmers, take advantage of this prosperous time to be frugal and save, do not let future years bring the pain of cutting flesh to heal wounds." His earnest and sincere words are beneficial to farmers, so they are recorded in this publication for wide dissemination.</p>
<h3>Leiyang Prices</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Zhang departed from Shanghai for Leiyang, Hunan. He traversed water and mountains, half by boat and cart, half on foot, and frequently encountered air raids, running for shelter over ten times. The places he passed were filled with broken walls and ruins, a shocking sight! After a month of detours, he finally arrived. He told me about the recent situation in Leiyang and the latest prices of goods, to give a glimpse of life there. He said, "Leiyang is the Leiyang County governed by Pang Tong in the Three Kingdoms period, about two hundred li from Hengyang. The customs of the people are still honest, and the cost of living is relatively low. The price of rice is about 25-26 yuan per stone, chicken is about 1 yuan per jin, pork and lard are 8 jiao per jin, eggs are 16 per yuan, coal produced is 5 yuan per hundred jin, and Xianglian is slightly over 1 yuan per jin. However, daily necessities are surprisingly expensive, with cigarettes costing at least 6-7 jiao per pack, matches 1 jiao per pack, and salt 1.23 yuan per jin, and not easy to buy. Silk and cloth are especially expensive. The area of Leiyang is very small, and the main business is in Hengyang. However, there are fewer air raid alarms. Although there are four or five theaters for entertainment, they all perform Xiang Opera, and people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang cannot appreciate its beauty." As the saying goes, "A mile out is not as good as home." Moreover, traveling in this extraordinary period, its hardships and difficulties are self-evident. I deeply hope that light will come and traffic will be reorganized to facilitate travel.</p>
<h3>How to Distinguish Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>How to identify fabrics? When you step into a silk fabric store, surrounded by the attentive service of the store clerks, you must make a careful choice in a short amount of time. At least you should have a simple preparation beforehand. Here, based on the author's service experience, I introduce a few relatively quick methods:</p>
<p>Regarding silk: Although silk fabrics are light and thin, the tightness of the warp and weft structure cannot be concealed or hidden, and can be seen at a glance. However, there are also great differences in the weight of the same silk fabric. Even with Guangkou silk, a popular silk, the difference in weight and price can be as much as ten yuan per bolt, and naturally two or three jiao per foot. Here, we must use a discerning eye to identify it. Heavier silk fabrics, such as electric spun, factory crepe, etc., are considered superior if they are smooth and shiny. Lighter silk fabrics, such as Chi Liu Sheng textile, Dian Pu, etc., are considered best if they are smooth, even, and flowing. Furthermore, silk is easily mixed with starch. If the starch is heavy, you can rub the fabric with your hand to scatter powder. If the starch is light, you can taste it with your tongue, and it will taste sweet. The silk surface will not immediately soak through after licking. As for whether the structure is tight, use your hand to pull the edge of the single-width silk fabric straight. If you find loose threads like pine flowers or a fish scale-like tear, this kind of silk surface is not durable. However, you have to distinguish a little between the weight and the cheap price.</p>
<p>Regarding cotton fabrics: As for identifying cotton fabrics, it is even simpler than silk. If the starch is thick and the fabric is thin, you can see when looking at it against the light that the fabric eyes between the warp and weft are completely covered by the starch, and the fabric surface is also relatively hard and has a special luster. To test the firmness of the fabric, you can hold one end of the fabric and first pull its transverse surface, then pull its longitudinal surface. It is best if it remains as it was originally after pulling, with no lengthening or skewing. For dyed fabrics, if you rub the fabric surface back and forth quickly with a white handkerchief and find that the handkerchief has color and the fabric surface has a halo, then the fabric is heavily starched and the color material is inferior. When the warp and weft yarns are broken, the fabric is inferior if it is hairy and loose, and it is durable if it is smooth and firm. There is also a kind of linen fabric, between silk and cotton, that feels smooth and firm when you rub it with your hand, and has many wrinkles after being crumpled. This is something that fabric buyers must pay attention to.</p>
<p>In addition, I don't know about woolen fabrics, serge, etc., so I dare not make any conjectures. I'll leave it to those with experience in this field to introduce them.</p>
<h3>A Week's Regular Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The Spring Festival is a season of feasting in the year. After eating the New Year's Eve dinner, followed by the New Year's wine, in addition to your own home, you also have to visit relatives and friends' homes, and everywhere you are always munching. For a while, fish, meat, chicken, and duck are eaten so greasy that even the appetite is ruined these days. In order to regulate the taste, I advise you to eat more vegetables and other light things during this week. Fortunately, the prices of vegetables are also particularly cheap these days. Rape and cabbage cost only five cents per jin, and chives cost only three cents per bunch. Not only are they cheap, but they are also crispy and delicious when cooked with more oil, so you really can't not eat them. If there are people who cannot eat without meat, and feel uncomfortable eating vegetarian food, then you may want to stir-fry shrimp with rape, or stir-fry shredded pork with chives, which is also a small amount of meat. In addition, stir-fried silver mustard greens, pickled soybean sprouts, shrimp and seaweed salad, and sesame oil spicy Chinese cabbage are also precious things to regulate the taste after eating a lot of greasy food.</p>
<p>Monday: Stir-fried garlic sprouts with shredded pork, stewed yellow croaker with snow vegetables, stir-fried cabbage, shrimp and seaweed salad</p>
<p>Tuesday: Celery with shredded beef, clam crucian carp soup, vegetarian ten scenes, dried tofu with mung bean sprouts</p>
<p>Wednesday: Stir-fried chives with shredded pork, shrimp and egg drop soup, stir-fried silver mustard greens, spinach with tofu</p>
<p>Thursday: Sweet potato with shredded beef, vermicelli bighead carp head, stir-fried rape with thread noodles, sesame sauce with water celery</p>
<p>Friday: Stir-fried cauliflower with sliced pork, sweet and sour yellow croaker, braised potato slices, pickled soybean sprouts</p>
<p>Saturday: Stir-fried onion with shredded beef, stir-fried rape with shrimp, braised cabbage, jellyfish potato shreds</p>
<p>Sunday: Stir-fried chicken giblets, fried hairtail, alfalfa, spicy cabbage</p>
<p>Matters of health and small ambitions – Tangerine, Zhang Jingren</p>
<p>The tangerine tree is about ten feet tall, with many thorns on its branches. Its leaves have pointed ends, are green and glossy, over an inch wide and about two inches long. Small white flowers bloom on the fourth day, and are very fragrant. The fruit sets and turns yellow in winter, the larger ones are like cups, with segments inside, each segment containing a seed, tasting slightly sweet and sour, with a yellowish-red color. Those with coarse and thick skin, much juice and sweetness, are commonly known as honey tangerines. Those produced in Fujian are red in color, and are called Fujian tangerines. The peel and reticulum can both be used in medicine. Similarly, Huazhou has tangerine trees in the government office, and its red tangerine peel is boiled into a soup to drink, and phlegm is immediately relieved. In the Qing Dynasty, it was a tribute item to be wrapped in reed mats, so it was not easy for the common people to obtain. The "Huazhou tangerine red" sold in pharmacies is mostly counterfeit. According to the "Classic of Materia Medica," tangerine peel can regulate qi, resolve phlegm, dry dampness, and move stagnation; the reticulum treats wei qi, treats reverse flow of qi from the lung meridians, unblocks stagnant qi in the meridians, and drives out accumulated phlegm outside the skin. In recent times, Westerners have refined its juice into medicinal tablets called Vitamin C, taking its effect of promoting salivation and digestion. Therefore, people overindulge in it for its nourishing power, but they do not know that its taste is slightly sour, and it can also cause phlegm. There are many myths about tangerines, such as in the "Record of the Supernatural and Strange": In Ba Yin's tangerine garden, after the frost, tangerines like jars were seen, and when opened, there were two old men playing chess, saying: "The joy in the tangerine is slightly less than that of Mount Shang." In the "Biographies of Immortals": Su Xian Gong told his mother: "I am destined to become an immortal. Next year there will be a plague in the world, and a liter of well water with a tangerine leaf can cure one person." The following year, there was indeed a plague, and his mother was asked to treat it, and no one was not cured. Therefore, later generations named Xiangqi (Chinese chess) "Tangerine Game," and called medical skills "Tangerine and Heaven." The ancients said that tangerines have virtue, so Qu Yuan used them as a metaphor for himself. Emperor Wu of Han set up a tangerine official in Jiaozhi, with a rank of 200 dan, in charge of tribute tangerines, which was considered extravagant by commentators. However, today the Siamese honey tangerines are sold at extremely high prices, and there are still many who eat them, do they have the same taste as the ancients?</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Again</h3>
<p>— Shuying</p>
<p>Prices are up again, taxes are increased again, again… Poor people worry when they hear "again"!</p>
<p>Another new dance hall opens, another "earthly paradise" appears, again… Rich people are naturally overjoyed when they hear "again".</p>
<p>The saying goes, "Blessings never come in pairs, misfortunes never come singly." But now, the poor people's "misfortunes" certainly do not come "singly"; the rich people's "blessings" happen to come "in pairs". No wonder the poor hate "again"; the rich sing praises to "again".</p>
<p>Originally, someone could come out to intervene with "again", to make it "one and not again, again and become one"; but now they are controlled by the money behind "again", and are reluctant to take "direct action"...</p>
<p>In this way, it is not until "again" is really out of hand that they come out with a stern face to "educate" them. The rich naturally respond with a cold smile; the poor have only three words: "Again"!</p>
<p>Another year has passed, and the future is long. Please, the gentlemen who manage "again", "examine yourselves three times a day", do not "again" allow a little money to keep the poor citizens in a state of perpetual sorrow, this is what is hoped for!</p>
<h3>People Who Wrestle With Numbers</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zimang</p>
<p>A "Spring Festival" Permeated with the Anesthetic Air of Monte Carlo</p>
<p>Spring Festival—is a season for gambling.</p>
<p>During Spring Festival, people are in the vortex of dice and roulette, spinning, turning, floating and sinking!</p>
<p>Street dice jump in celadon bowls. The "stall owner" wearing a round felt hat murmurs: "Open the bet! Gold ingots roll in! Ah-ya, one five makes a pair, one pays three..." This kind of "gambling song" accompanies the dynamics of dice and banknotes, singing, surrounded by some rough men, so there are rough shouts, and some local ruffians, smoking inferior cigarettes, look around to keep watch." Sometimes the police come and disperse the stalls, but they gather again afterwards...</p>
<p>There, is a car repair shop, which has been closed for the Spring Festival. Several apprentices are sitting on the ground playing poker, with tattered banknotes placed in front of each. Before long, they are arguing, throwing "Old K" and "rotten egg" at each other, and the fractional currency is almost blown into the gutter by the wind. …</p>
<p>This is an alley, and the sound of shuffling cards is heard. That set of ivory mahjong tiles—more than three hundred—floats on the white tablecloth. These ladies and grandmothers usually use this to pass the time. It should be even more lively during the New Year. Ten yuan as the base and sixteen rounds, playing from after lunch until midnight. The men haven't come back either, the big ones have gone to play in rooms, don't follow that vixen...</p>
<p>Hmm, it is this beehive-like building, immersed from morning to night in the rich light of hundreds of cream-colored light bulbs. The waiters are very busy, shuttling through each room. The accountant answers the phone:</p>
<p>"...Sorry, no rooms available...They were all booked early last year!"</p>
<p>In the room, the radiator is boiling. The dealer is piling up stacks of banknotes and coins. The people next to him surround him. One person anxiously picks up a pair of ivory tiles. The eyes of the people on this side are widened: "Heavenly King!" with joy; but the dealer's luck is very "red", it is a pair of "man tiles". Before the joyful nerves have recovered, there is another wave of depressed and slight cursing.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, the gambling is not exciting enough, let's go to the '× Country Hotel'."</p>
<p>The car wheels are spinning, and countless trees recede behind. The "Hotel" parking lot is crowded with black-license plates.</p>
<p>Inside: It's a heat wave. The big glass tables are surrounded by people bursting with blue veins, sweat dripping from their foreheads to their chins; the men in suits have taken off their coats and vests, and their ties are crooked; the men in Chinese clothes have taken off their coats and vests, and their buttons are loose; the place to buy chips looks like a play: buying two hundred, five hundred, one thousand, five thousand, signing checks: ten thousand yuan, fifty thousand yuan, one hundred thousand yuan; sit down, a fragrant hot towel comes, hot green tea comes, are you hungry? That cherry-lipped and charming girl guides you to the dining room.</p>
<p>The numbers on the roulette wheel, to whom will this large pile of banknotes belong, waiting for your judgment...</p>
<p>The elderly and a group of elegant literati like to hum and harmonize. If there is no poetry when gambling for money, it is considered "spoiling the fun", so there is the game of "guessing poetry riddles". Gathered under the electric light, stacking poetry strips, like "Willow Catkins fluttering in the wind", is it guessing "Goose", guessing "Swallow", guessing "Butterfly", guessing "Crow", guessing "Oriole"? Shaking heads, guess "Swallow"! Drop ten yuan, but the answer turns out to be "Goose". The dealer takes out an ancient book to verify, smiling...</p>
<p>In the dance hall, before stepping into this magical cave of changing lights, some people are attracted by the slot machine in front of the door. Although, there are prohibitions, but this "tiger" is still sticking out its tongue in this dark corner. People put in coins, bananas...lemons...oranges...apples flicker in the glass strip, blurring their vision...</p>
<p>The Spring Festival in Shanghai has the anesthetic air of Monte Carlo!</p>
<h3>Firecrackers</h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>Ping! Pang!</p>
<p>Suddenly, breaking through the silence of midnight, came two such sudden sounds. Almost at the same time, sparks illuminated the dim night sky.</p>
<p>Ping! Pang!</p>
<p>One just died out, and another bloomed with brilliant flowers. That sound, that light, is like thunder, like lightning. Although it is only a moment, it is so precious to this blind and mute world!</p>
<p>I silently looked into the distance, listening. I also heard my heart beating, and saw my blood flowing.</p>
<p>At this time, something roared again somewhere: crackle, crackle, crackle!… I regret that I cannot see the raging fire. But it's better not to see it, anyway, from that constant rapid sound, I can better understand the igniter's hope for the future and desire for new life.</p>
<p>The next day, I finally went to buy some firecrackers.</p>
<p>For firecrackers, I seem to particularly like the small ones. Look: These little guys, tied together, look so dull! When I hang them on the pole, light a match, and ignite one of them, they are no longer so weak and docile. Like a crowd of angry people, the environment forces them to suppress the heaviness in their hearts, and fully express their hatred and revenge for their experiences. Look at them: struggling, agitated, fighting! When each of them is alone, they will only flash a spark, shake once, and emit a puff of smoke. But now, they are more like a machine gun!</p>
<p>The smell of gunpowder that I haven't smelled for a long time, at that time, drilled into my nostrils again. My eyes were dazzled by the gunpowder smoke. I seemed to be standing on the street again, hundreds of cars driving past me, and those cars emitted such a gunpowder smell, mixed with joyful shouts. That made me jump for three days!…</p>
<p>The sound of the firecrackers gradually became fragmented. On the ground was a pile of embers still smoking. I finally set off firecrackers for a whole morning with definite optimism and joy. Of course, my mood still has some "reservations", reserved for the "festival" in the near future!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>What could the waiters in restaurants or inns not know about all the secretive and shameless deeds in the world? As soon as Begonia entered the elegant seat left by Granny Wang, the two waiters both exited, although one of them had cast a wicked glance at the hostess, who was dressed in glittering jewels.</p>
<p>"Yo! Boss Wu, why aren't you wearing a hat in such cold weather?" Granny Wang stared at Begonia charmingly, and the strong fragrance of cosmetics rushed straight into the other person's senses.</p>
<p>Although this was not what Begonia had expected, seeing the situation, he understood.</p>
<p>"Why don't I see Seventh Master?" He wanted to turn around and ask Rong Kui, but this follow-up gentleman who had retired successfully had already disappeared without a trace; he couldn't help but blush and immediately wanted to back out.</p>
<p>But how could Boss Wang's wife let him leave?</p>
<p>"Let me take off your cloak for you!" She walked briskly to Begonia's side and stretched out a pair of pink hands—a pair of hands that had never done anything beneficial to anyone—really wanting to take off his fur cloak.</p>
<p>Wang's white face, bright red lips, coupled with a magnetic smile and such gentle speech, almost melted this young artist in his twenties.</p>
<p>His face flushed, completely losing his power of resistance.</p>
<p>"Things must rot from within before worms infest them... If you want others to respect you, you must respect yourself first..." Liangyou's loyal words suddenly rang in his ears again, making him feel a lot more sober in his mind.</p>
<p>Over the years, he has actually been tempted by the outside world a lot, but this is the first time he has encountered such a close-quarters situation; his own reason obviously cannot control him, but fortunately Yuan Shaowen's constant advice is able to wake him up at critical moments. (20)</p>
<p>— Most Despicable</p>
<p>— Juehui</p>
<p>There are three types of evil people:</p>
<p>The first type is blatant, appearing in public, and is evil in a straightforward manner; the second type is secretive, sneaky, and evil in a somewhat sinister way; the third type is a "human" during the day and a "demon" at night. They say "Amitabha" to people, but do all kinds of evil behind their backs; only this third type, and only this third type, is the most despicable!</p>
<p>How can it be seen?</p>
<p>Evil on the outside can be dealt with; evil on the inside can be guarded against; only this "dagger in the smile," this "good person" wearing a mask, deceives people without them knowing, makes them suffer without them knowing…They know nothing!</p>
<p>The so-called "highly respected," "meritorious," "compassionate,"… seem to be "nothing to say"; in fact, they are hoarding and speculating, extorting and defrauding, doing everything; yet people often consider them "good people."</p>
<p>These people are truly the most despicable!</p>
