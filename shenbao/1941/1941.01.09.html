<p>今日的世界，業已屆臨侵略與正義，破壞與安寗的最後決戰關頭。誠如羅總統所指出：一九一八年的和平固然算不得公允，但假如倡導所謂「新秩序」者眞將如願以償，用武力把世界從新分割，其結果至多只是造出更多的黑暗和罪惡，並為未來時代埋伏下無窮禍根。武力與侵略並不能改變歷史，只有理智和公道纔是人類進化過程中的明燈，然而當一切都不免遭受强暴威脅的時候，理智與公道也必須武裝起來纔能杜絕黑暗與罪惡的蔓延。巴黎和會中威爾遜總統崇高理想的失敗，便是由於太忽視了現實的力量，而他的失敗。同時便促成了美國孤立主義的拾頭。但是孤立的結果並未替美國造出光榮，亦未為美國換得安全的保障，反只是在客觀上助長了若干國際罪惡的遂行，與美國處境的困難。今日羅斯一福的偉大抱負實即威爾遜崇高理想的擴大和延長：可是一九一八年的世界還可暫獲一時的安寗，一九四一年的危局則絕不會便任何荒陬海隅獲得安枕：世界最大多數人都厭惡戰爭，而戰爭却逼到每個人跟前。使厭惡戰爭的人到最後也不能不以戰爭保衛自己。羅總統在最近兩度演說中所提出的見解和主張，自然應為全世界所景佩。而他為了克服種種謬見和惰性所下的苦心，也更值得人們的同情，</p>
<p>截至屬稿時止。尙未得悉世界各方面對於此一咨文所表現的全部反應，同時自更無從揣知遭受羅斯一福嚴厲譴責的侵略國家。看到閏當當美局將竭力以支援反抗侵略各民主國家為己任，內心究作何等感想；料其於表面故作鎭靜之際，怕也難盡掩其悻悻之色吧、也許他們還在怨天尤人，　羨古代暴君與侵略者的命運，所謂一東亞新秩序與歐洲新秩序根本與西半球無關」的一類　之詞，還不是儼然在痛恨美國不該如此多事，干預他們的遂行其『天然願望』？無奈人類文明旣已進化到電氣時代，自然不再適於尼羅皇帝抑或愷撒亞歷山大一類人物及其企圖的存在。而且自從各洲間的距離大為近代交通利器所縮短之後，彼此間的命運也正有如銅山洛鐘之相應答，再也不能劃分明顯的界限，於此亦可見硬要在地球單位之外，在各洲劃為「新秩序」的分野，實無異於達反時代的愚蠢，而把海洋以至國界看成侵略者不可逾越的天塹者，其愚蠢亦復相同。</p>
<p>如果說世界的命運應該取決於最大多數人類的意見，那麼如果把羅總統的建議付之全世界人民公決，結果由衷擁護者大槪會在百分之九十九以上。而在今日造成滔滔此變者，其實為數也不過是人類當中極少的一羣，雖其擁有可供驅策的若干人民與遂行破壞的犀利戰具：其所以竟能肆其荼毒，主要原因仍由於遭受侵略者則孤軍獨戰，而未受波及者則袖手旁觀；這種現象。即至近頃，亦尙未澈底打破，這也就是侵略毒熖一時不能戢息的主因。今日美國擁有全世界最富的資源與最强的實力，已往未能早事運用此一憑藉，使其政治抱負得告貫澈，其原因雖有多種，終屬重大遺憾。今茲羅總統已毅然把中國和英國看成美國的國防，而以美國為民主國家的兵工廠，更要求國會增加新經費，授予新權力，以便以日見增多的船隻飛機坦克車與大砲供應與侵略國作戰的各國，旣不因此等各國償付能力不給而却步，復不為獨裁者所發動的威嚇所動搖，這是美國內外政策的新紀元。也是十年來國際局勢演變中的新紀元。</p>
<p>雖然羅氏仍以不使戰禍延及西半球為言，但他確己如日前美方人士所表示：把支援中英看得比使美國避免戰禍更重要；他而且明顯地說：「一獨裁者如準備對吾人作戰，固不待吾人有戰爭行為」，這一語表示了美國的決心，也戳穿了侵略者虛聲恫嚇的慣技。對於美國這一新的步驟，侵略國家固然至感不快，但預料其終無以阻撓美國國策的遂行，亦將無以對付反侵略者日益增强的實力。日本雖擁有在目前尙佔相當優勢的海軍，以言對美作戰，則資源實力決心以至士氣都是重大的問題。只有那種純在虛矯之氣支配下的論客，纔敢斷言日義合作即可擊敗美國；事實上，以其全力侵華三年又半，且苦於收束無術，如其再向另一非常强大的巨人挑戰。那也不過重蹈吉珂德先生的覆轍而已</p>

<h3>青年的力量</h3>
<p>— 陳立夫</p>
<p>日本和我們打了三年多之後，曾於無意中發表出一個結論說：「中國青年的力量，不可忽視，」他的證據，一個是湯爾和的兒子乘船到美國去，過日本時不肯上岸，又一個是殷同的兒子，不願在日附所辦的學校讀書，隻身逃往昆明某一大學去借讀。（東京某座談會紀錄），我們不能以人廢言，應該承認這個觀察是很正確的。因此，我也願意引用幾個極簡單，更積極的事實，替他作一個註解，我以一個文化事業負責人的身份，正式答復日人，我們的機關校舍圖書儀器等項物質的部分，被燬壞的確是不少，但是日人計劃中想獲得的結果恰好和他們的想像是相反的，最明顯的十個例證，就是除去淪陷區域不計外，現在大中小學人學的人數，都較戰前增加很多，我們另有統計表冊發表，人人都可以覆按，此外未入正式學校的青年一部分，是分別參加各種專業的訓練，成為建國各部門中必需的技術員工，還有一部分熱血沸騰，體格健壯的，都一律投入各軍事訓練機關，御上戎衣，正式荷　去充衛國前綫的戰士，至於淪陷區域內的靑年怎樣呢？說到這裹，我眞有無窮的興奮和快慰！我在重慶不斷的和青年學生接觸，其中有很多是從東北四省，或平津冀魯等地徒步走來的，他們的衣裝很襤褸，但精神非常振奮，他們經過無數的饑餓和危險，但是身體和毅力越麼鍊越堅强，他們已經不是專靠父兄懵懵憧憧過活的孩子了。這樣到重慶到各省各地的青年，每天都有，而且一天比一天多，其數雖然不易統計，但以本年暑假敎育部在重慶一地舉辦戰區失學中學生的登記為例，只有十天左右，所登記的人數巳達三千人，其餘當可推想而知了，這是就從淪陷區到自山區的青年而言，還有至今尙在淪陷區的，其數目是更多，其處境是更苦，而其行動的表現，更值得讀佩，那些拋棄了家庭，及其自身所有的一切，而從事於游擊等項實際工作的，眞不知道有若干萬人，其他素號强悍的地方，青年們的英勇事蹟，更是有聲有色了，至於性情比較柔和，或被環境拘縛的無數學生，他們於萬分無奈之中，去進日附所辦的學校，其目的只在解險悶坐的無聊，獲得一點必要的知織，畢業文憑他們是不屑接受的，實巳不勝其數，看吧，日附要掩飾和平，正極力開辦學校，眞正願意入學者究有幾人，巳入學者又是抱着何種意念，這個問題我願意等待淪陷區的青年們自行答復。</p>
<p>上面這個簡短的叙述，實不能盡中國靑年對於作戰所表現的力量的千百萬分之一。只不過是對日人觀察所得結論，略舉一二例證，以資解釋而已。我現在想說的，是中國青年何以會有此力量，這個力量將會產生甚麼結果。</p>
<p>對於第一個問題的答復，我以為中國青年的力量，就是中華民族的力量，也就是中國文化的力量，我常常說，我們中華民族的抵抗力是非常雄偉的，時間愈長，力量愈大，侵略愈甚，抵抗愈堅，從黃帝對抗蚩尤起，直至現時為止，歷史上的證騐眞是指不勝屈，（參看學生之友一卷六期），何以我們能夠如此，這是因為我們中華民族有一個「生我所欲，義我所欲，合生而取義」的共通信念，有了這個信念，在平常的時候，則以陸邦族以敷敎化，在危急的時候，就發揮出「威武不屈，富貴不淫」的偉力，而凝成這個信念，完全是從日常生活的敎育中陶鑄而來，我們一般的意見，對於一個受敎育的人，並不以其能讀幾本書，懂得幾個公式為巳足，必須先要懂得做人的幾種道理，反之，若果懂得了做人的道理，雖不讀書，也算是受過了完全的敎育，第一個道理就是仁，所謂仁，其解釋為一相人偶」，就是人與人相處的方式，你要予智自雄，奴視他人，即是不能與人為偶，就失其所以為仁，不仁者稱為殘賊，殘賊之人謂之獨夫，一為獨夫，則無所往而不作惡，這樣的人，人人可得而誅之。</p>
<p>第二個道理就是義，義是因地因時而制其宜的一種正正當當的行為，就是當着人類生存發生障礙的時候，必需要用種種方法予以掃除，即使犧牲生命，亦在所不惜，很多人誤會了以為中國人是最易和環境妥協的民族，隨意而安的思想，籠罩著整個的社會，其實這完全是皮相的說法，我們中國人天性愛好和平，厭惡戰爭，確是事實，但厭惡戰爭，並不是不能戰爭，也不是畏懼戰爭，可以說是最長於戰爭，歷史上的實例極多，茲不縷舉，即如這次對日作戰，我們總裁會經鄭重宣告世界說：「和平未至絕望時期，決不放棄和平，犧性未到最後關頭，決不輕言犧牲，」這兩句話將我們中國人處事的態度，表示得最為明確，所以到了不得不犧牲的時候，我們是不顧一切，不達目的不止的。</p>
<p>第三個道理就是禮，禮解作理，一作履，就是順乎天理，應乎人情，大家共同遵行的一種法則。試問在作戰三年半中間，所有大大小小的「組織」，有那）個離開了日人的兵力而能建立起地方的秩序，原來禮起於敬，而終於和，六合天理的人情的人，在中國人的心目中是根本厭棄的。</p>
<p>最後的一個道理是智，知識是人人所不可缺少的，但知識並不是讀死書，記公式，必須要能够審問之，愼思之，明辨之，然後才眞是有用之學，換句話說，知識是對前三種做人的道理的，輔助所謂「讀聖賢書，所學何事，」就是學做人的道理。昔哀公問孔子孰為好學，孔子對曰，有顏回者，不遷怒，不貳過。這好像是答非所問，其實孔子的意思是以顏回能做到不遷怒不貳過，就是他的學問最好的具體表現。（待續）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（廿）（九）　英国官西綫日記</h3>
<p>日前，我會往色當前綫視察，深信我方若能以紀律之師，堅決抵抗，德軍要想突破陣綫，非付下死傷五十萬人的代價不可。現在怎樣呢？砲台重重疊疊，深達五英里，而德軍長驅直入，損失不過五百人。推原其故，無非因為色當防務最稱堅强，乃以最弱的軍隊防守所致吧。守軍大半是巴黎人，士氣最壞，急降轟炸機光臨時，實際上殆無多大死傷，他們祇耐住了兩個鐘點，便像老嫗受驚，雙手掩耳而逃。參謀部軍官多為之落淚，實也無足為怪了。</p>
<p>我們旋即採取緊急決定。空軍總指揮已得英軍總司令戈特，聯軍總司令甘茂林，和法軍參謀長喬治的同意，向英內閣請求，急調京畿轟炸機隊，來法助戰，以挽回局勢，但未實行。空軍總指揮得總司令部准核，從空軍部隊中派出戰鬥機四隊，掩護轟炸機。新式戰爭確是瞬息萬變，我們都焦急地等待着。</p>
<p>軍事聯絡團第二國主任斯威尼將軍，已與總司令部接洽就緒。轟炸機司令部允派飛機百架，歸空軍指揮調遣，喬治將軍當可感到滿意了。可是空軍司令已失去了痛擊敵軍的機會。振作士氣的重大努力和上面所記的緊要決定，都已失之太遲。給予敵軍以致命打擊的計劃，竟未見諸實施。謹慎，安全第一，貽誤了戎機了。</p>
<p>晚十時：轟炸機七十架由數鬥機掩護，「在色當參加作戰。牠們飛得很低，損失了三十七架。但牠們已完成作戰目標，德軍所架的三座浮橋，已被全部炸毀了。法軍反攻，竟也克復了凸角四周的高地，總算獲得局部的成功。</p>
<p>喬治將軍擬在明天二次反攻，以冀奪回色當。法軍已準備以轟炸機六十架參加戰鬥，英軍轟炸機司令部亦決定再作大規模的攻擊。</p>
<p>五月十五日：不必多說，到明天再記吧。只是今天下午，德機廿六架會轟炸鐵路，的一小時後，我出外視察損害情形。德機所投炸彈，多係延遲爆發的，現正開始爆炸。德機投彈頗準，損害甚重，車站已起火焚燒。</p>
<p>早餐時　報，局勢頗為司慮。敵軍已自狄南至色當長的五十英里一綫渡過末斯河。但截至此刻，德軍似尚侷促於該河左岸，第九軍正在色當抵抗，狄南方向，我軍反攻已收復一部份失地。</p>
<p>今晨有大批難民，經過此間，多數乘着脚踏車，也有坐着破舊車輛的。早晨，鐵路被敵機猛炸，我正在薙鬚，一枚大鐵蛋從頭上飛過，噓噓作聲，落下處相距咫尺。一切都很使人沮喪，但或者尚未絕望。戰事還在初期，絕望還談不到，但此處的法軍，却顯然令人失望。據非正式談話，法軍有退至愛納河之說。但我很不解，法軍和左翼的英軍將如何聯絡呢？這一問題，現在就要解答了。</p>
<p>下午二時：英軍方面傳來的消息似乎還好。適纔又有消息傳來，七路軍總司令已南來接收第九軍，第九軍司令已准「解職」，外傳已經槍決，不知就是。</p>
<p>麥斯特列脫橋失守的經過情形，宛如一種神話。一個平民裝束的人，走到橋東，以友誼的態度，向守兵請求放他過去，和橋西一個同伴說幾句話。守兵答應了，他就過橋，談了幾分分分鐘，便和那位朋友一同走回，行近守兵。道第二個人便像暴客一般，突然把守兵擊斃，飛奔回橋西，把所埋的地雷導火綫割斷。橋東的一人也在這時攫取了已死的守兵的槍械，以防他人干涉。德軍時刻的準確，眞是可驚，不到幾分鐘，降落傘兵，滑翔飛機，已紛紛從天而下，降落到橋西荷比兩軍的砲台頂上。守軍尚莫明其妙，德軍已把砲台包圍，手溜彈拋入瞭望洞，炸彈摜到砲位上。頃刻之間，一座砲台已成活地獄，開着的門和砲塔裹面，都有炸彈投入。未及一小時，德軍已把麥斯特列脫橋頭佔領了。照我們的預計，德軍非犧牲五萬人，斷難成功，現在却祗損失了三百人！</p>
<p>色當是因空軍轟炸而陷落的，法軍後路截斷，兩小時後即行潰退。麥斯特列脫橋頭則係在不聲不響之中被敵襲取。這就是兵家所謂出其不意攻其無備的妙用。</p>
<p>最後又有一些好消息傳來，據說英軍已在盧文反攻得手，這事雖不足信，但軍心或能藉此稍振。我恐怕法軍已經放棄了收復末斯河陣地之意。法軍戰術，似與他們的傳統精神大相逕庭。</p>
<p>下午八時：法軍戰報惡劣巳極。德軍在末斯河左岸的據點已見擴大。自勤白勞至色當以下某處，徧地皆是德軍，且已西進至羅查。羅查在拉翁之北，距我軍司令部所在地沙耐僅四十英里。</p>
<p>下午十時：達士梯將軍已把司令部結束，並即匆促離去。形勢已萬分急迫，我們也決定撤退，擬於明晨三時，隨空軍總指揮前往英空軍司令部。這三小時中，眞是匆忙已極，一切重要物件，如鋼質文件保管箱，地圖箱，壁上掛圖，打字機，和桌橋之類，盡行收拾，裝入司令部的運輸車。各人的箱籠行李，也在一時三十分全部裝好，連吃剩的半瓶車厘酒也一同帶走。</p>
<p>五月十六日：我與吳道爾，奧克鮑羅，和車夫何根，在下午十時，駛往柯羅米鎮英空軍司令部。除隨身手槍外，並携帶步槍兩枝，但是遇見敵軍戰車隊，也將毫無所用。北路英空軍前敵司令部的撤退，至此已告完竣。</p>
<p>今晨事情已很明白，假使法軍都有鬥志，或者士氣尚未全衰，聯軍仍有獲勝希望。德軍突入法軍陣錢，成一寬廣的凸角。他們兵力已疲，軍需燃料，附近亦不能有大量的儲藏。昔日拿破崙三世在色當一戰，全軍覆沒。假使法軍能攻德軍的左翼，以橫截此凸出點，未嘗不可反敗為勝，使德軍遭遇拿破崙三世的命運。</p>
<p>英國國內也無迅速的決定。我們亟需戰鬥機兩百架，以迎擊德軍的轟炸機，但卻未為當局所重視。空軍部對於前昨兩日的緊急請求，謂當重加考慮。像上次歐戰時一樣，防衛偷敦，常被認為重於防衛法國。擄我個人意見，法國方面抱怨英國，恐怕即以缺乏虎鬥機援助，為唯一有理的口實。</p>
<p>今天我們和一個法國軍官談話，他叙述防守色當的法軍和德國轟炸如何破壞他們的抵抗力情形。謂法軍已在心理上被告征服，無力支持了。這句話我們聽見過不止一次。這種情形都是急降轟炸機所造成的。急降轟炸機可由戰鬥機尅制。假使我們有五百架迎擊敵軍戰鬥機，色當尚能保全不失。內閣對於昨日之事，或尚一無所知，吾則他們必將改變方針了。從報紙上看來，英國民衆顯然未因敗　而稍感沮喪。我們都記得上决歐戰中馬爾納河之戰，因此都存着歷史或將重演的夢想。（未完）</p>

<h3>糧食　一二號貢暹諸米　仍在塲外暗中活動　本米昨始下降一二元</h3>
<p>洋米現價仍在執貨者居奇　守中、然以到源蟬聯、定貨擁擠、回籠英華司原包售價已見銳落、故現貨小絞已經照限量七十九元售開、次七十八元、碎米米茶因在平糶期內、實銷淸淡、貨方未能再為扳俏、故亦能在限價綫內售開、惟西貢一二號及暹邏一二號火絞等仍乏正式交易、暗中仍在活動、市外貼費配價仍有繼續發現之說、洋米定貨新交易因滙縮劃高、未有成議、惟劃價仍能通運、洋商亦在兜售、且前定各米亦在相繼抵埠中、因此回籠原包續見下趨、蓋人心平定、新囤觀望、而獲利浮多頗擬在年內結束、故小絞現貨原包祇開九十三元、而西貢米已到原包自費祇開九十六元發、轉棧運費祇九十八元、比前市銳落三五元、即一月中旬小絞路貨亦祇八十三元、比前日小去一元、特米菉開七十七元、次七十五元半七十五元、碎尖高自七十四元、次至七十元左右晒僅六十六七元、全日原包回籠共計的五百多噸、現貨不足三千包、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨仍屬零星、惟一般貨主見洋米似有垂疲直降之勢、已無守持之心、售意轉鬆、同時木街店胃以價高壓、不願多備、去路亦頓衰疲、在此雙重情形之下、售價遂突落一二元、若崑山斛見白粳除高貨尚須一百零五元左右、中關者已祇百零一一三元、靑角斛見薄稻大市貨已進百元大關、售九十八九元、不過高貨售一百零一元至一百元、原包百零四元、</p>
<p>糯米去路本屬最　、際此他貨悉呈疲頹之間、市色愈覺萎靡、價遂續跌元砠、宜溧白元開九十二元至九十元、香港貨開八十一元、次至七十八元、糯菉普通七十二元半、次至七十元左右、</p>
<p>一方洋米到源、接連而來、昨日又有太古公司太原輪、由香港裝來八千四百三十九包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、又法公司金弟亞號昨晨抵埠、西貢直接裝來洋米六千零二十六包、另有苞米七千四百五十九包、停靠虹口華順碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>洋粉到滬不少　粉價依然上騰</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日粉市稍見回振、華粉廠盤二十一元五角、照常平賣、至陰歷年終為止、再定辦法、洋粉售價、前經一度回落、昨日上午開盤、以隔晚金市猛升、一般囤手、不復在市求脫、且聞南洋幫客稍有動、人心即行轉好、野牌喊價二十四元五角、美麗牌由二十四元二角、緊至二十四元三角半、花烏鐘樓消化最為普遍、亦由二十四元一角半升至二十四元二角半、後市再度喊高二角、惟目下各貨均在散戶手中、動輒扳持、漲落倏忽、市面動蕩不定、</p>
<p>洋粉　源源來滬、除前昨怡和裕生輪裝來九千包、太古江蘇輪裝來五千、已誌前報、茲悉昨日太古公司太原到滬、除運來大批洋米外、又有自香港載來洋麵粉二萬三千五百八十七包、計本年祇有一週、洋粉進口、已有二萬七千餘包之鉅、</p>
<p>小麥　咋日交易依然無聞、在目下到存枯乏之際、偶有零星成交、為數僅百數十包、售價仍站三十五元左右、日廠門市亦屬無貨可收、市面不脫檳持之局、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯寗靜</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯喑市、為狀寗靜、上日所傳種種謠言、本日已銷聲匿跡、不再聞及、晨聞後雖有投機需要、而匯豐等頗肯供給、美行及其他外行俱賣、市面鬆動、本月份美匯大致均做五元五六二五、惟迄收盤前、忽有小額進戶求購、價乃轉平、結果英金平定、為三便士半、美匯五元五三一二五、軋鬆〇三一二五、</p>
<p>匯豐頗有供給</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均平、紐約銀價作平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬長〇六二五、美對英滬等未更、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士半、美匯五元半、較之上日晚收、英美兩匯悉平、開後聞投機家首有進意、但不久英行匯豐已肯供塞、市面即呈穩中帶硬之狀、計匯豐售予外行下月份美匯五元半、九點半匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀稅亦平、此後美行塞出一月份美匯由五元五三一二五至五六二五、至先令則做開為三便士五一五六二五、午刻前華銀行對做本月份美匯均吿五元五六二五、迨至收盤時、少數買戶略扒、市况靜穩、結果現貨及本月份英金二便士半、美匯五元五三一二五、下月份英金三便士四八四三七五、美匯五元半、比隔昨收市英平美硬〇三一二五、</p>
<p>港滬匯兌微升</p>
<p>香港八日（週三）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、英美日各匯均無上落、（美匯現貨昨收為二十三元六二五、）申匯現貨升一元、為四百二十七元、（昨收為四百二十六元、）十一時三十分告平、各匯概無變動、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津英鬆美縮</p>
<p>天津八日（週三）電、今晨匯市開盤呆帶、倫敦電匯硬〇一五六二五、為三便士八五九三七五、紐的電匯軟〇三一二五、為六元〇二五、申匯升一角二分、為九十元〇一角二分、一聯鈔」暗盤昂五角、為八十五元五角、</p>
<h3>謠風已息　金市銷挫</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、以上日謠風並無發展、人心轉定、匯市告鬆、走勢難高易下、惟晨開尚昂、計為六千四百四十元、此後金銀號及匯票商等相與塞出、數度跌進六千四百元關內、最賤為六千三百六十元、中證券幫略吸、迨至午刻、以外匯回平、金銀號等復進、價始穩守四百元關、結果收盤為六千四百〇二元、比上日軋低四十一元、半日交易的六千餘兩、銀樓飾令終則掛小十元、關金等平、現金照期交價低二十元、金號又售予某銀號八十兩、</p>
<p>烚赤跌四十餘元</p>
<p>晨初以上日漲風餘威、開盤堅穩、證券幫首入銀號廿兩、為六千四百四十元、較上日做高十元、未幾聞外匯開出鬆硬、金銀號兩幫先後吐塞、價遂撳落、終被壓入四百元關內、計銀號對做三十兩、為六千三百八十五元、嗣以證券幫來撈、止跌步上、重出四百元關外、計證券幫入金號二十兩、六千四百廿五元、但不久又因匯市仍長、現金號暨匯票商力售、銀號幫依然放出、致賣風頗熾、最低已降逹六千三百六十元、迨至十一時一刻、聞匯票又稍回平、金銀號俱購、升達六千四百元外、計銀號入金號二十兩、六千四百二十元、收盤前會回至六千四百元、結果微升二元、告六千四百〇二元收盤、午後週三無市、較上日軋小四十一元、半日上落約有八十元、現金號之本牌金售價較烚赤約低數元、收進低四十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、上午十時掛低十元、計大同行改懸六百五十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元云、</p>
<h3>中央新角票　暗記與形式一斑</h3>
<p>中央銀行新發行國父像之一角二角兩種鈔票、木報因製版故於今日刊出、其左印有「壹角」或「貳角」字樣、係中華民國二十九年版、四角亦均印有「壹角」及「貳角」、地紋為「中央銀行壹角」、或「中央銀行貳角」篆文、均為淺綠色、四周邊緣及左面圖案、一角則為深綠色、兩角則為深藍色、其背面之色澤亦同、背面均為洋文、中央圖案及四角中均嵌10或20及一九四零年字梯、地紋中有CentralBank　of　Cnina之字、</p>
<p>以言暗記、據察得一角票正面圖案壹角二字頭部之中間、有一形似「正」字、國父像橢圓圈左下之花葉中有「央」字、左上角「壹角」之角字一撇下、有若篆文之「出」字、左下角「壹角」之角字頭上之一撇旁、有　英文暗記、其背面右下角10之0上、有一「山」字、左下角10圖案近邊之裹邊綫中、若有一「央字、其上花邊、細綫之間、有中字跡、</p>
<p>二角貳角兩字中間有「上」字、國父像上外邊網綫上有「A」字、國父像外圈花紋有「中」、背面右上20角網綫中有「中」字其下元寶花紋下端有「K」右下20角網綫內左上角有「日」字、傍有「　」暗號、正中20網綫內20角上中間有「中」字下有「T」字、左下角20角網綫內左邊有「B」字左下有「日字」、有The字元寶花紋中有「H」、左邊元寶花紋下有「Y」、</p>
<p>以上所述、自不能完全謂為暗記、抑何太多、但有特殊處自摘出耳、</p>
<h3>美金票下降</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、忽又趨跌、英美金鎊、因亦下落一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票一度退至十七元九角二分、卒為十八元、比上日終降五分、香港票稍有供給、市價略軟、日金票及朝鮮票業巳止跌轉漲、前者高至一元六角、後者升為一元二角一分、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布銷路　門市已成尾聲</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市過程平定、交易淸淡、乃因廢　年關在邇、本街忙於淸結賬目、鬥市店亦以冬銷已成尾聲、故交易一致减少、同業心思交易互有進出、客幫採辦績而不斷、售盤白貨漂染布大市平穩、一部份手貨組布跌每疋一角至二角半、木街成交各布三百餘件、浙閩幫辦細布細斜色布漂染等一百數十件、粵港幫辦藍布斜紋等近二百件、國外南洋幫辦漂染各布三千數百疋、</p>
<p>東布　昨因實銷呆頓、市氣又疲、白貨細布每疋跌四五角、細斜跌二三角、龍頭細布後市收盤價為四十元零九角半、四君子嗶嘰新棧單每碼一元一角八分半、老棧單一元一角三分半、</p>
<p>出口　棉布今（九日）有三百七十件、運往香港、又有十件、運往暹邏、又有三十八件、運往新加坡、</p>
<h3>南北貨　紅日蓮俱漲</h3>
<p>湘蓮因到存均稀、市勢步緊、昨市本湖蓮行售二百六十元、白連到存更缺、售至三百七十元、下檔湖蓮新貨開過一百三十餘元、行售一百三十元、（前日頂莊菜係開一百二十七元、誤為一百二十五元、特更正）</p>
<h3>證劵　內債又見新高價</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市經前日下午稍稍回小後、復轉上翔、上午尚　平穩、午後更一律再見新高價、扶搖直上、其漲風已不可以常理論、市塲多頭心思非常濃厚、有增無减、裕興雖已停止收質、信孚進胃尚濃、十六號巳不若前之興奮、而同康忽又有大批收進、經此一再吸收、空頭一則以高壓太重、二則以利息期近、補者又接踵、紛紛抵進、浮多乃乘高出籠、市塲人心、大都丙種看七十元、但能否一鼓作氣、登峯造極、是一問題耳、昨日交易又極發達、上午同康信孚及聯益十六號買進、抬價甚力、生大萬泰聯和順昌及益昌均有賣出、午收即比隔日為高、午後同康信孚及十六號繼續買進、聯和鴻大亦有吸收、但易中聯益樂茂鼎康潤德均紛紛賣出、市况忽高忽低、波動不已、結果仍被勉力抬高、收盤結果，一致再漲四角半至一元三角半、成交總數、的近四百萬元之多、前列簡明表於後、類別最高最低收盤比前日</p>
<p>股票交易、成交永安公司股一百股、價為二十二元正、</p>
<p>又衆業公所、股市開盤、趨勢不定、收盤時又略轉堅、有數種久告冷淡之股、茲叉為衆屬目、同時各著名股、亦有人竭力維持、初時衆以此番多方必已購買逾量、但結果反見空方起而抵補、以及新多活躍、橡皮股穩中帶堅、</p>
<p>倫敦七日（週二）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、稍呈起色、中國債券善後借款（英發）上升五先令、價為三十四鎊五先令、道淸鐵路借款升半鎊、價為十七鎊、英股麥加利銀行股升二先令六便士、價為八鎊七先令六便士、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股續升半鎊、價為七十穴鎊半、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價平定</h3>
<p>昨糖市上落甚微、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧七十八元二角至五角、升五角、荷赤現貨六十六元三角、升一角、一月十五日打單DYH嘜六十六元八角至五角、太古車白B嘜西棧新貨七十八元二角、一月十五日打單七十八元二角、HX嘜七十六元三角、H嘜車赤西棧六十三元八角、</p>
<h3>紗花　進出靡常　紗市起伏</h3>
<p>紗市稍昂、但實際交易依然沉悶如恒、惟投機商心思仍屬不一、且市塲謠風未息、所以倏而買進、倏而放出、大有人在、因之市盤益呈起伏不定之狀也、不過同業中之議論、以為目下雙馬紗比較太高、雜牌紗似乎太廉、同樣二十支紗售價差程度、在一二百元之間、然投機目標、吃重在雙馬做伸縮也、午後雙馬一千三百五十八元、有人賣出、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開因上日午後、標金市塲又起謠風、市價亦被抬高、多頭乘機活動、首盤價為一千三百六十五元、此盤一開、有一部份乘勢出檔、市盤又向下降、跌至一千三百五十七元、中途時升時下、為時殊久、旋後外匯和平、標金忽上忽下、同時現銷不暢、跌至一千三百五十一元、但同業中有一部份在多頭地位、盈利者扒空、又復回升至一千三百五十八元收盤、查半日間成交統計五千六百三十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲十二元、九日運小呂宋六十件、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>同行五、四〇〇　統計　五、六三五</p>
<h3>棉市平庸</h3>
<p>現棉情况、較昨為遜、廠方辦胃殊澀、加之棉紗銷路狹隘、對於原料絕少發展、所以棉市前途仍難昂昇也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市市况堅定、先因投機者之購買、續後則又因同業之購買、結果收盤價格較之上日漲六七磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來續無起色、各方購意殊為靜寂、同業方面亦抱觀望態度、然一般之預料、棉市決不致疲弱也、</p>
<h3>煤炭　烟屑市氣穩固</h3>
<p>烟煤塊近日雖過於供求、市頗疲弱、惟煤屑現銷仍暢、客幫辦胃最健、木街亦有起色、市氣非常穩固、計開印度烟煤屑每噸一百九十元、開平屑一百六十八元、基隆屑一百六十元、以上均同業行拆、木街發客、酌加外費、</p>
<h3>煤球仍守原盤</h3>
<p>煤球行情、前月曾傳新年又將續漲之說、但自開關以來、外匯反鬆、煤球亦暫守原盤、同業自車、每噸一百六十八元、送到加車力三元、木街門莊發客、送到每噸一百八十元、每担概售九元、但大多數店家、照市便宜一兩角不等、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紐約用絲减少</h3>
<p>據路透電纫生絲存底報告、十二月份生絲在美銷用大减、計本月份銷用二、三二三包、較十一月份减一三、二六一包、較前月尢减一六、七六四包、是故存底亦見增多、計本月份存底七二、二四八包、較十一月份增多一一、九一八包、較前月更多二三、九五一包、然本月份進口并無多、計數為三五、零三一包、較上月及前月相减的有一千餘包、故十二月份華絲輸美總無起色也、茲將紐的生絲市况列表如下、</p>
<h3>五金　本釘盤元同疲</h3>
<p>狂跳已久之本元釘與新盤元市况、日來殊感鬆懈、查其原因、當為實銷呆滯、交易零落、加之總結束期將屆、亦足以影響其實銷、致同業人心未敢挺昂、行盤亦趨疲途、查昨市如本釘每桶倍司喊七十二二元、而實交生意則七十元出零、亦有所拋開、新盤元市價則每担售七十六七元、較前已回小有三四元不等、此外五金花色亦多、因同業盤存、以備結束、而少趨穩定、未有多大漲風耳、</p>
<h3>進出口　雜糧運往香港</h3>
<p>今（九日）、有豆子六百八十包、芝蔴三百包、並蔴油一千聽、生油三百四十聽、及茶葉十四件、運往新加坡、運小呂宋、亦有豆子三百包、運往暹遜、則有豆餅五百地、</p>

<p>各界盼望　合理解決</p>

<h3>工部局加捐在邇　各方不勝負擔　對納稅人會議決極重視　局方發表財政艱困情狀</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局為彌補其二千萬元之赤字財政、經工部局總董之提議、領事團已定於本月二十三日下午二時三十分、在靜安寺路跑馬總會舉行納稅人特別大會、以便通過再度加捐四成、中外納稅人、以事變以還、工部局頻頻增加捐稅、公衆負担、業已綦重、在此物價高昂、市民經濟臨於破產之際、再事增捐、竭澤而漁、前途隱息、實不忍設想、故各方對本月二十三日納稅人特別大會討論加捐案、一致寄其重視、允以華人各界、實因不勝負担、顯示堅決反對之意、</p>
<p>工部局之加捐理由</p>
<p>工部局昨發加捐之理由一文、詳述財政短絀情况、茲錄全文如决、納稅人特別大會、舉行在即、該大會之召集、專案討論本局所擬征收捐稅附加費百分之四十、以及增加各項執照費辦法、茲特為文解釋加捐之理由、以告納稅諸君、</p>
<p>財務情況　具載報告</p>
<p>本年度本局各處經費預算、號尚未提交各有關係委員會審核、但財政上之需要情形、目前已極為明顯茲首先須明瞭者、即倘非損及公衆治安與衛生者、則無法由於改組或限制各項行政、或裁汰職員之辦法中、繼續從事于經費之撙節、本局曾設置一獨立性之經濟委員會、該委員會在本市政年度內、開會多次、其報告書已詳載本局公報、納稅諸君、可請參閱、加以研究、將來本局開支或增或减、耍皆視物價及匯率之高下而定、此種因素、直接影響于發給職員之臨時生活費津貼者匪淺、</p>
<p>常年開支　虧短甚鉅</p>
<p>當上年度預算編訂之初、即已感覺各項開支之增出、比收人為巨、用是增收捐稅附加費百分之五十、但加捐之舉、係在下半年方始實行、預計下半年之收入、當可抵銷開支、同時希望本年可以產生一平衡預算、徒以外匯緊縮、物價高漲、結果經常支出、比原預算書超出七百八十萬元左右、收入方面雖超出預算四百六十萬元、而全年虧短之數、的計八百七十七萬五千元、（原預算所列為五百五十七萬三千餘元）以上各項、均為的略之數、至于最後虧空之數、恐與上數大相懸殊也、</p>
<p>提高待遇　影響尤大</p>
<p>發給職員之臨時生活費津貼、在上年年初為百分之四十、迄十月份為止、此項津貼、會兩度提增、同時發給華籍職員之米貼、亦大見增加、此外各項人力物力之所費、莫不激增、故收人雖較為豐裕、但未能與支出情形相吻合、上年全體職員之間、對於薪給問題、表示不滿、外籍職員之離職或辭職者、的計一百七十人、其後華捕因酬報問題、發生嚴重之不安情形、以致本局對於全體職員之薪津、不得不通盤考慮、結果決定再度提增各項津貼及米貼、每月需費的一百萬元、其中七十一萬四千元、係用於華籍職員方面、故比類職員受惠較多、例如公役一名、十二月份收入比十一月份增出百分之五十二、但各處首腦人員、十二月份所得、比十一月份僅增百分之七而已、</p>
<p>本年短缺　二千萬元</p>
<p>如果本局收支情形、任令長此以往、則本年度虧空、估計當在二千萬元左右、其中一千二百萬元、由於增發津貼而起、又本局在增發津貼以前、經費原屬支細、全年託需虧短二百萬元、又恢復外籍職員長假之修正辦法、每年需費三百萬元、此項費用、為上年度預算書所未列人者、又公債之付息與還本、本年度預計比上年度的增一百萬元、又上年度預算書所列各項按照合同必須付給外幣之款項、係以四辨士折合國幣一元計算、目前匯率較低、故本年度此類支出、勢須多費一百萬元、基上種種、故本年度虧短、合計當在二千萬元左右、職是之故、加捐之舉、不容或緩、倘延至本年四月間再行議增、則前加之數、自必較巨、此外召開納稅人特別大會對於納稅人之另一利益、即為經濟委員會所提關於增收各項執照費之建議、可使其立即收效也、</p>
<p>加捐所獲　勉敷抵補</p>
<p>市政總捐與地稅、如按照一厘征收、每年可得　一百四十萬元、目下捐率為百分之廿七、增加附加費百分之四十以後、每年可增收一千五百十二萬元、加以各項執照費修改以後、每年可增三百五十萬元、併計每年約增一千八百六十萬元、抵補上項虧空、不足之數、擬即提高房產之估價、以圖彌補、至於上年度估計虧短八百七十七萬五千元、擬暫予移人臨時費項下、再行設法補救、目前所請納稅人付給者、僅為足使本局應付本年度各項開支而已、</p>
<h3>歡迎貝克博士　已有定期　十七日假紅棉酒家　二批小麥藥品將到</h3>

<p>談自由</p>
<h3>給做歌女的母親</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>不久以前，自由談發表過一篇華萍女士的『我的媽媽是歌女』，當時曾經引起許多讀者的注意與響應。共中有一位讀者勸華萍女士將來『好好地擇一個好夫婿』。碰巧華萍女士又寄來了『我的婚前誡條」一稿，我們覺得她的觀點還算正確，可以做社會上一般未婚女子的參考，因此就在這裏給發表了。</p>
<p>我們以爲華萍女士的母親，爲了社會與環境的壓迫，不得不做歌女以謀生，是一件不幸而值得同情的事；而她那種爲了培養女兒而奮鬥十四年的精神，允其值得佩服。祇是歌女是畸形社會的產物，是有閒階級的享樂工具，不能說是一種對社會有貢獻的工作，因此我們希望華萍女士的母親，以汝每個覺悟的歌女，舞女，嚮導女，都能力自振拔，另謀光明而正當的出路，以求對於家庭與社會，都能發生良好的影響。</p>
<p>我們知道在這荊棘遍地的社會上，正當的婦女職業所受的阻力是非常之大的；我們也知道在婦女的社會地位尚未穩固的今日，女于要在社會上活動是一件困難重重的事，可是我們不必因此氣餒。我們不希望有甚麼奇蹟發生，我們祇要抱着能走一步就進一步的精神，這些婦女職業的阻力，有一天是將要崩潰的。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>我的婚前誡條</h3>
<p>— 華萍</p>
<p>年齡隨着經騐在增進着，昨天媽對客人們談起我時，偶然聽到一句「是將出嫁的年齡了。」</p>
<p>出嫁，是的，主張早婚在中國，已成了普遍的意見。女兒不能在娘家吃一世，十八歲啦！有人，—很多的女子，已做了孩子的母親。雖然她們自己也只是孩子，可是她們已嘗過了生育的痛苦，餵乳的麻煩。倖運十八歲的我，還是一位閨女，在早婚的中國，這不能不使我暗地慶幸。</p>
<p>同學間，我們常在無意中談起結婚。我們對出嫁並不畏懼，雖然我們也並不歡迎。不過女子遲早總應出嫁的，而這也是必然應當的事。幾多的母親們，在焦急她們女兒的婚事，幾多的女兒在昨天聽到她們母親吐露自己出嫁的消息。是的，我們應該準備了，這正是我們擇偶的時候。•對結婚，我並不覺得惶恐，我有我的計劃，我有我的誡條。</p>
<p>首先，我不希望我的配偶是位十全十美的人，我只要他能像自己一樣够了。我不是超人，更無需他是超乎一切的人。他只要能像普通人一樣，有普通的優點，同時也有普通的缺點。我不能嫁給一位一切比我高超的人。</p>
<p>其次，我不嫁給一張大學文憑，或博士頭銜，我要眞實的學問，—實用的技能。我不希望他的敎育造詣比我高深得幾倍以上。做一位博士太太是件虛榮的幌子，但智識的懸殊却是件苦痛的實事。</p>
<p>再次，我不嫁給一輛汽車，或一座鄕問別墅。我不需要生活的安逸而失去眞實的愛情，假使我要嫁給一輛汽車的主人，一定先認淸車主合不合做我配偶的條件。</p>
<p>第四，我不能嫁給一個性趣互異的男子。我喜歡動筆，我不希望他不看報章不讀雜誌；我喜歡逛公園，不希望我的配偶只知紙牌和賽馬。縱然他用赤誠來愛我，我不能嫁給性趣互異的男子。</p>
<p>第五，我不嫁給崇高的名譽，我要健全的體格，和眞實的愛情。我不希望做病態名人的內子，終身侍於病榻；也不能嫁給什麼部長或行長，終身忙於應酬，而無實際的生活樂趣。</p>
<p>最後，我不貿然就嫁給我欲嫁的人。在戀愛期中，沒有一個男子不盡量掩護自己的缺點，表現深切的欽慕和敬愛。可是結婚後，他却任意地暴露了他的劣跡。這或許就是「結婚是戀愛的墳墓」的來源。與其婚後再趕到離婚法庭，掀起家庭不安的巨波，劃下內心痛苦的創傷，不如在婚前有深長的考慮，到深刻瞭解對方性格爲止。</p>
<p>讓我們在婚前有長時期的準備，精細的選擇。讓我們喊出「結婚是幸福的開始」的口號。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「孩子氣！」玉崑笑着說，怱怱地出去上塲了。</p>
<p>「誰是大人啊？」玉琴駁了他一句，可是玉崑根本沒有聽見。</p>
<p>玉琴自己也未嘗不承認還是一個小孩子，並且有時候也常在班子裏跟師兄弟們頑弄各種全部孩子氣的巴戲，可是他心坎裏所藏着的一種厭惡男人啗旦角的心理，却一天一天的在滋長着，儘管那些存着壞心眼的先生們和師兄弟們不斷的要抽空向他調笑，或是故意特別的好待他，他却祇有厭惡和憎恨。他會的束定自己的孩子氣，整天把臉扳得像快要厮鬥的公雞一樣。每决出臺，一聽到含着邪意的彩聲，便禁不住要生氣；然而三四年來，始終還只是生氣，不曾像那個大胖子的吼聲一樣的使他害怕過。這吼聲所表示的已經不祇是調笑和挑逗的成分了，簡直要把他整個兒的吞下去！</p>
<p>在最近的幾天裏，這些情形就不斷的困擾着玉琴的腦神經；他的理解雖然還是很幼稚，但一種不利的預兆，已很明顯地透露在他的面前了，允其是今天上午所發生的一件事，更增加了他內心上的憂鬱。</p>
<p>「不，媽咋兒才來過，我何必再想她呢？他的視綫慢慢地從窗外的槐樹上，移到了玉華的那一張很淸俊的瘦臉上去，一面沒精打彩地說。</p>
<p>「是不是爲了方才師傳告訴你的一件事不高興？」玉華偏着腦袋，似乎很有把握地猜測着。</p>
<p>這一猜倒眞的猜中了！今天早上，當全班九十多個學生照例一起在院子裏練完了功以後，掌班的宋師傳，突然走到玉琴面前來。一張忠厚得不像吃戲飯的紫膛色的圓臉上，堆出了很爲難的神氣，輕輕地向玉琴說：　「不要就回下處去，我有話要給你說咧！」</p>
<p>玉琴不由立刻怔怔了一，因爲他知道要是沒有什麼大事，師傳是從不單獨和那一個學生說話的。他想奈道自己犯了什麼規矩嗎？那個摔得滿身灰土的趙玉崑，，也在人叢裏回過頭來，向他伸一仲舌尖，扮了一個比哭還難看得的鬼臉。</p>
<p>這是我們這一個小丑的特長，每逢他把這個鬼臉扮出來，玉琴和任何一個同學都忍不住好笑；可是今兒玉琴却笑不出來了，只得握着一顆七上八下的心，跟定着他師傳，慢慢地走進後面去。（四）</p>

<h3>囤積的故事</h3>
<p>— 三兵</p>
<p>正因米貴而發愁的我，看到下面一個故事，現把牠寫在後面，希望大腹便便的老闆們淸醒一下，而有所警惕。</p>
<p>宋朝時候，開封府地方有一個富翁姓秦，人家因爲他爲人吝嗇，都叫他秦剝皮。他靠着心計好，會盤算，掙了一份家產。但是人心苦於不知足，有了一千，還想一萬，所以常常買賤賣貴，囤積居奇，希望獲利。這一年，他家裏積有米糧一千担，等待時機，撈取額外的贏利。機會來了，這年秋天，逢着早災，赤地千里，粒米無收，糧食價格步步飛漲，災區難民嗷嗷待哺，有人勸秦剝皮把存粉出賣，使市價回平了，也可稍資救濟。秦剝皮獰笑着說：「這樣凶年，一生難遇，現在我碰巧遇到了，豈可輕輕放過？我必須等到米價高到無可再高，然後出賣，那時，我就可成一大富翁了。」</p>
<p>秦剝皮一心做大富翁，囤米不賣，貧民餓死的成千累百，他的心一動也不動。過了半年光景，情况更見嚴重，有一夥挺而走險的災黎，從山東竄來，經過開封，聽見秦剝皮家裏囤積着米糧，便首先搶刦他。衝進門去，適巧碰着秦剝皮出來攔阻，便把他一刀殺了。米糧便散給了難民，地方上的人都說：「這樣沒良心的人，受此收塲，眞是天網恢恢，疏而不漏呀！」</p>

<h3>「紅粉金戈」觀後</h3>
<p>— 望直</p>
<p>金星成立於去歲，越時未久，就其公映作品來說，確是做到了「製作謹嚴」這一點。在黃色電影湧現時候，金星以屹然不苟態度製作了較爲嚴肅的片子，，這對整個電影界激起了一個好的影響，爭取了時裝片的抬頭，幫助了有內容有形式的作品日趨矯健，這些該不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>「紅紛金弋」雖然也是古裝片和民間故事，但不同的是經過改編與揚棄了。</p>
<p>就形式言，「紅粉金戈」是部古裝片，但歷史劇的優點便係通過舊的形式而給以新的內容，善於改製的話是更能加強諷刺性。</p>
<p>至於說到民問故事，倒不是拍不得，而是看怎樣拍？吳永剛將馮夢龍的故事搬到銀幕來，可是他把它存在的缺點完全克服了，這一努力是值得一些導演者注意的。</p>
<p>在導演手法上，有著靈活的表現，而對氣氛的創造雖做得還不能全部十分的運用，至少織接上是狠聰頴的。導演對演員，觀衆情緒的控制，也是成功的。</p>
<p>在掃蕩黃色電影的歲首，金星這一獻禮，是每個愛護國產電影者所當誠意接受的。</p>

<h3>「西線無戰事」作者　雷馬克在好萊塢</h3>
<p>— 貝立</p>
<p>十年前電影界轟動一時的「西綫無戰事」，使主角劉亞理斯在好萊塢奠定了共鞏固的地位，但現在不過拍些米高梅的「俠醫」連續片而已。同時這張影片也使原作者伊寇•麥利·雷馬克（ErichMaria　Remarque）的名望立刻煊赫起來，他的這部作品被認爲世界文壇上反戰小說的傑作。</p>
<p>雷馬克就此敎德國當局所驅逐，至今流浪於國外也將近二十年了。他最近到好萊塢一遊，作短期的考察，各方熱烈歡迎，已成爲好萊塢社交界中最出風頭的一個人。</p>
<p>雷馬克在好萊塢除了常同他的德籍友人瑪琳黛德麗在一起之外，也與聯美公司的當局保持接觸，因爲他的近作Flotsam（直譯爲漂浮於海中的貨物）是給他們攝製成電影的，導演是鼎鼎大名的的翰克朗威，曾導演「海角遊魂」和「民族精神」。</p>
<p>雷馬克不預備久住在好萊塢，不過爲了答謝各方面熱烈的關心和期望，他將爲各影片公司編寫反戰及暴露德國內幕的各種電影劇本。</p>
<h3>章臺柳</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>小婢道：「我們問過他的，他的名字不肯直說，似乎道出姓「石」來。」柳如是一聽那不速之客姓石，不覺心裏突然觸　舊事，遂點點頭道：「那人爲何這樣纒繞不淸？我只得云一見他了。你們可先引導他到內書房中去坐，好好款待。「小婢諾諾答應，走下樓去了。柳如是放下書卷，立起嬌軀，換了一件外衣，娉娉婷婷的下樓，走至內書房外，早見男女僕人有好幾個都站在那邊伺候。柳如是一擺手道：「不用多人侍立，祇須小婢碧桃在此，餘可退去，靜候呼喚。」衆家人答應退去。柳如是掀帷而入，見炕床上正踞坐着一個虬髯大漢，托着一杯茶儘喝。不是昔年垂虹亭畔所遇的石達，還有誰呢？形容雖無大更，而風塵滿面，一種不得志的景况，可以概見。石達一見柳如是，连忙把茶杯放下，跳起身來，向伊一揖道：「柳夫人別來無恙，可還識得當年鐵丐嗎？」柳如是微笑道：「怎麼不認識壯士呢？多年不見，時時憶念，不識壯士一晌在那裹？從何而來？且請坐了見告。」石達謝了一聲，仍在炕床上側身坐下。柳如是却坐在旁邊一個錦凳上。石達又嘆了一口氣說道：「前蒙柳夫人和黃公垂愛照拂，銻袍之誼，沒齒不忘。自得金陵侯公子一函後，曾往投寗南侯麾下，也曾擐甲執戈，相隨殺賊。後因寗南侯跋扈驕橫，野性難馴、遂去而之他。嘗從總兵黃得功，力抗胡虜。不幸得功戰死，俺遂流浪江南，仍爲鐵丐。也有舊時的同袍招俺同去淸兵帳前立功，俺誓不願爲異族效力，殺害自己的同胞，所以寗爲餓莩，不肯前去。後來飄蕩至舟山羣島，忽遇，……」（三〇）</p>
<h3>修養要語（六）</h3>
<p>事情多，嫌得太忙，事情少，嫌得太暇，忙也不好，暇也不好，那末如何才好呢？我告訴你，事情忙，要會得安排，安排得當，雖忙不亂；事情少，要會得我事做，能找事做，決不會無所事事！</p>
<h3>「孔夫子」後晚在金都重映</h3>
<p>民華「孔夫子」在金城的賣座盛况，可說出乎一般人的意料之外，但爲了金城與金星有約在先，在去年卅一號晚上終於把這年節讓給了「紅粉金戈」，不過金城主人答允「西廂記」在新開幕的金都映期滿後，「孔夫子」繼續在這新院子重映，這消息已誌木報。現在知道已決定於十一日晚塲重映了，上次沒有看過「孔夫子」的觀衆，再勿失去這最後的機會，因爲民華曾聲明過「孔夫子」不再在二輪戲院公映。</p>

<h3>Hunan Northern Japanese Troops Invade Southward, Suffering Heavy Losses from Chinese Attacks and Retreating Northward; Japanese Troops in Southern Hubei Divide Forces to Reinforce but Fail; Chinese Troops in Western Hubei Recapture Yingwan and Advance Towards Shashi</h3>
<p>Miluo: Since the beginning of the new year, there have been frequent reports of victories from the Chinese troops in northern Hunan.

<p>Hanoi: Vietnamese Governor-General Vice Admiral Decoux recently delivered a speech in the Consultative Council, making a statement on the details of the border conflict. The wording was extremely firm, stating roughly: We have already adopted a policy of "striking back at those who strike us," and we will respond to any provocative actions. We will not hesitate to use force to retaliate when necessary. If neighboring countries still do not know how to restrain themselves, then we will have no choice but to intensify our resistance. Our air force has always been in the lead, which is commendable. The courageous resistance of the French troops and Vietnamese indigenous troops is particularly determined. I would like to take this opportunity to thank these brave men who defend the border. After the Thai and Vietnamese sides signed a non-aggression treaty on June 12th last year, the Thai government, without any justification, has delayed its implementation. It has even repeatedly made unreasonable territorial demands. When these demands were not met, it brazenly took various aggressive actions in a systematic manner. Our country has refused these demands. As for these aggressive actions, after verifying that they were not due to misunderstandings or unauthorized actions by the country's border defense forces, we resolutely retaliated. However, although the Vietnamese government is determined to safeguard its own rights and territorial integrity "to the end," its desire remains to coexist peacefully with all its neighbors. We are neither weak, nor internally divided, nor discouraged. This has already been clearly demonstrated to the Thai government. If it can fulfill its treaty obligations and express its willingness to establish normal relations with us, then we are ready to accept it at any time. (7th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Discovers Large Number of Oil Wells</h3>
<p>Moscow: Mr. Silsky, a member of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, recently wrote in Pravda, "After six years of work, geologists have discovered oil wells in Ukraine with a daily output of 100 tons. Investigations have found that there are oil reserves from Poltava to Akhtyrka westward. From this, it can be seen that there are many oil wells hidden in central Ukraine. At the same time, scientists have confirmed that there are oil wells on the north and south banks of the Sea of Azov. In other words, the existence of oil wells in western Ukraine has become a reality. In short, the oil reserves in western Ukraine, Bukovina, and Ukraine are greater than those of the Second Baku and will be able to meet the needs of the entire Soviet Union in two or three years."

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A New Era in American Domestic and Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>A week ago, President Roosevelt concluded 1940 with a sharp and insightful fireside chat. Then, just yesterday, he embellished the beginning of 1941 with a grand and unprecedented State of the Union address. Dispatches spread the news, and the masses were greatly encouraged. This, along with the simultaneous news of the British army capturing the important North African town of Bardia, made this New Year season exceptionally extraordinary, filled with a new atmosphere and hope, deeply impressing upon people the undeniable truth that history will not regress and humanity will not be destroyed.</p>
<p>Today's world has reached the final decisive moment between aggression and justice, destruction and peace. As President Roosevelt pointed out: the peace of 1918 was certainly not fair, but if those advocating the so-called "new order" truly get their way, using force to re-divide the world, the result would at most be to create more darkness and evil, and to bury endless disasters for future generations. Force and aggression cannot change history; only reason and justice are the guiding lights in the process of human evolution. However, when everything is inevitably threatened by violence, reason and justice must also be armed to prevent the spread of darkness and evil. The failure of President Wilson's lofty ideals at the Paris Peace Conference was due to neglecting the power of reality too much, and his failure simultaneously promoted the rise of American isolationism. But isolation did not bring glory to the United States, nor did it exchange it for security. Instead, it objectively contributed to the execution of some international evils, and to the difficult situation of the United States. Today, Roosevelt's great ambition is actually an expansion and extension of Wilson's lofty ideals: but while the world of 1918 could temporarily obtain a moment of peace, the crisis of 1941 will never allow any remote corners to be at ease. The vast majority of people in the world are disgusted with war, but war is forcing its way to everyone, so that those who are disgusted with war cannot but defend themselves with war in the end. The views and propositions put forward by President Roosevelt in his recent two speeches should naturally be admired by the whole world. And the hard work he has put in to overcome various fallacies and inertia is even more worthy of people's sympathy.</p>
<p>As of the time of writing, the full reaction of all parts of the world to this address is still unknown, and it is even more impossible to guess what the aggressive countries, which have been severely condemned by Roosevelt, are thinking when they see that the US government is determined to support the democratic countries resisting aggression. While pretending to be calm on the surface, I am afraid it will be difficult for them to completely hide their resentment. Perhaps they are still blaming fate and envying the fate of ancient tyrants and aggressors, and uttering words such as "the East Asian New Order and the European New Order have nothing to do with the Western Hemisphere," aren't they clearly hating the United States for being so meddlesome and interfering with their pursuit of their "natural desires"? Helplessly, human civilization has already evolved to the electric age, and is naturally no longer suitable for the existence of figures like the Nile emperor or Caesar Alexander and their attempts. Moreover, since the distance between continents has been greatly shortened by modern transportation tools, the destinies of each other are as responsive as the copper mountains and Luo bells, and can no longer be divided into clear boundaries. From this, it can also be seen that forcibly dividing the continents into "new order" divisions outside of the global unit is tantamount to the foolishness of going against the times, and those who regard the oceans and even national borders as insurmountable moats for aggressors are equally foolish.</p>
<p>If the fate of the world should be decided by the opinion of the vast majority of mankind, then if President Roosevelt's proposal were submitted to a global referendum, the results of heartfelt support would probably be above 99 percent. And those who are creating this tumultuous change today are actually only a very small group among mankind, although they possess some people who can be driven and sharp weapons for carrying out destruction. The main reason why they can be so rampant is still because those who are subjected to aggression are fighting alone, while those who are not affected are watching with their arms folded. This phenomenon has not been completely broken even recently, which is the main reason why the poisonous flames of aggression cannot be extinguished for a while. Today, the United States possesses the richest resources and the strongest strength in the world. It is a great regret that it has not been able to use this advantage earlier to make its political ambitions come true. Now, President Roosevelt has resolutely regarded China and Britain as the defense of the United States, and the United States as the arsenal of democratic countries, and has requested Congress to increase new funds and grant new powers, so as to supply the countries fighting against aggressors with an increasing number of ships, airplanes, tanks, and artillery, neither retreating because these countries cannot afford to pay, nor being shaken by the threats launched by dictators. This is a new era in American domestic and foreign policy, and also a new era in the evolution of the international situation in the past ten years.</p>
<p>Although Roosevelt still said that he would not allow the war to extend to the Western Hemisphere, he did indeed express, as American officials had said before: that he regarded supporting China and Britain as more important than avoiding war for the United States. And he clearly said: "If a dictator is prepared to fight against us, it does not wait for us to have an act of war." This sentence expressed the determination of the United States, and also punctured the usual trick of the aggressors' false intimidation. The aggressive countries are certainly very unhappy with this new step of the United States, but it is expected that they will ultimately be unable to obstruct the implementation of American national policy, nor will they be able to deal with the increasingly strengthened strength of the anti-aggressors. Although Japan possesses a navy that still occupies a considerable advantage at present, in terms of fighting against the United States, resources, strength, determination, and even morale are all major problems. Only those theorists who are purely dominated by a false sense of superiority dare to assert that Japanese-Italian cooperation can defeat the United States. In fact, after invading China with all its strength for three and a half years, and suffering from the inability to end it, if it challenges another very powerful giant, it would only be repeating the mistake of Mr. Quixote.</p>
<h3>The United States Has Morally Formed An Alliance With China and Britain. If Congress Passes The Lend-Lease Plan, It Will Supply Self-Defense Countries While At War.</h3>
<p>Washington - The Washington Post editorial stated that the United States has morally formed an important alliance with China, Britain, and Greece, and the US President's address to Congress further proves the strength of this alliance. People here generally believe that the aggressive countries are too involved in making the United States act like electricity, because the German, Italian, and Japanese alliance publicly threatens the United States, and these three countries have stimulated the United States with aggressive remarks and military talks held in Berlin, creating the current policy of the United States. The most important part of the US President's remarks is to show that the unity between the United States and the countries resisting the new order of dictatorship is inseparable. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt will today submit to Congress an address that is no less important than his previous statement that "we cannot allow democratic countries to surrender." This time, the President will propose recommendations for the new fiscal year, the main point of which is the section on greatly increasing military preparedness and new national defense expenditures that he made the day before. Observers are confident that the President's proposal can be passed by a majority of the members of the House of Representatives, but it may not be able to get more than thirty affirmative votes in the Senate. It is generally believed that once the President's proposed war equipment lend-lease plan is passed by Congress, the existing weapons and new ship production will be entirely used by the President to aid democratic countries in resisting aggressive countries. If so, American destroyers can be used by democratic countries, and if the American Air Force feels that it is possible to lend them to other countries for application, it will also be handled accordingly. It is generally believed that this move is a full answer to the general expectation that American aid will not be realized early enough to cope with Hitler's new offensive this spring.

<p>American Aid to Anti-Aggression Countries, Chongqing All Circles Are Extremely Interested</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Daily News published an editorial this morning, stating that President Roosevelt's speech to Congress is enough to serve as a warning to aggressive countries. The future policy direction and determination of the United States can be clarified from this. The United States does not want to see the countries resisting aggression defeated, and will provide them with military supplies and material assistance. Totalitarian countries may call this kind of action a violation of international law or an act of war, but the United States will never succumb to intimidation. As for the Far East, Roosevelt has regarded Australia, Europe, Asia, and Africa as equivalent, so China is also among the countries resisting aggression. Roosevelt's policy is not only a wise policy, but also a policy that follows American public opinion. We firmly believe that the United States will not only prohibit exports to Japan, but also prohibit the import of goods from that country into the United States. Ta Kung Pao also published an editorial, stating that Roosevelt's speech is like a roaring lion, fighting against aggressive countries.</p>
<p>Chongqing - People from all walks of life here are extremely interested in President Roosevelt's State of the Union address, and they all believe that what the President said, "American security has never been threatened by foreign troubles as much as it is today," "If the current war to defend the democratic system fails, the manpower and resources of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia will all be dominated by the conquerors," these few sentences have expressed the emotions of the United States, Britain, and China. In addition, the President also advocated allowing countries resisting aggression to obtain military equipment worth 100 billion yuan from the United States without having to pay cash, and this proposal has extremely important significance, and "is enough to fully express the common will of the American people, regardless of party affiliation," and the US Congress will definitely pass it. The President also said that even if the dictatorial countries claim that the US aid to the democratic countries is an act of war, they should ignore it. This sentence is especially worth pondering.

<p>President Roosevelt's Message, Germany, Italy and Japan Temporarily Do Not Comment</p>
<p>Berlin - No comments have yet been made here on President Roosevelt's message to Congress. According to a responsible person who declared to foreign journalists, the German side is seeking to receive the full text of the message and cannot immediately study it. (8th Hsinmin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian officials have not yet commented on President Roosevelt's message, but political figures stated that Roosevelt's argument is based on the threat of the Axis powers to the Americas, but at the same time stating that the enemy will not send troops across the Atlantic Ocean to attack the United States is somewhat contradictory. Roosevelt's message probably does not want to stimulate the emotions of the anti-interventionists. Roosevelt attempted to deeply impress the American public with the danger of the "Fifth Column," and raised the issue of international police. Roosevelt believes that the peace of 1919 was fairer than the appeasement policy before the Munich Conference. Italian political figures do not want to argue with this, but American people, who value reality, should deeply understand the crux of the current political system in Europe that cannot be maintained, and the reason why the United States must aid Britain twice in twenty years. The political situation that has been shaken twice in twenty years is due to instability and injustice. Roosevelt advocated domestic democracy, but did not advocate democratic principles in the international arena, so that countries with abundant resources and countries with poor resources maintain a balanced state. (8th Hsinmin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Tokyo newspapers unanimously criticized President Roosevelt's message to Congress today, referring to it as tantamount to declaring war on the Axis powers. The Daily News stated that the most noteworthy point in the President's message is the sentence that the United States should become the arsenal of democratic countries, which is tantamount to declaring war on the countries fighting against Britain and China. However, the Japanese Imperial Army has a firm determination to be prepared to break the American plan to transport military equipment through the Japanese blockade line to Chongqing. Hochi Shimbun stated that various provocative attitudes of the United States, such as actively aiding Britain except for participating in the war, lending to China, and the joint British, American, and Australian naval defense against Japan, have created a gap between the United States and the Axis powers. The US President's remarks today are another clear proof that this gap is widening. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers recently recognized that President's speech to Congress on Monday foreshadowed America's entry into the war.

<p>Bullitt Delivers Speech, Strongly Advocates Aiding China, Britain and Greece</p>
<p>Chapel Hill - Former US Ambassador to France, Bullitt, delivered his first speech since leaving office last night at the International Relations Club in North Carolina, saying that the surest way to defeat the Axis powers, without risking the danger of totalitarian victory, is to do everything possible to help Britain, China, and Greece. In order to reduce the danger of an Axis victory, the United States must help Britain, China, and Greece with the supplies they need, and not only to protect our own safety. We hate war, so the question of joining this war as a national policy will not arise... all are used to protect our own safety. We hate war, so the question of joining this war as a national policy will not arise. Because we hate war so much, we are willing to use the strength of the people of Britain, China, and Greece to defeat the dictators without the need for our military assistance. We deeply know the consequences of a totalitarian victory, and how we are now opening our eyes to take this risk. At this time, the American people would rather take this risk than not join the war, which can undoubtedly be suppressed. Our non-participation in the war is greatly beneficial to the totalitarian countries. While they are currently attempting to conquer Britain, China, and Greece, it can be asserted that as long as Britain continues to fight like this for one day, no matter how much and in what form our aid is, they will not want to fight with us. The dictators will undoubtedly be more angry, but before conquering Britain, they will never dare to treat us</p>

<h3>The Power of Youth</h3>
<p>— Chen Lifu</p>
<p>After Japan fought with us for more than three years, it unintentionally came to a conclusion, saying: "The power of Chinese youth cannot be ignored." Their evidence was that Tang Erhe's son refused to go ashore when his ship passed through Japan on its way to the United States, and that Yin Tong's son was unwilling to study at the school run by the Japanese, and fled alone to a certain university in Kunming to audit classes. (Records of a certain symposium in Tokyo). We cannot dismiss words because of the person, and we should admit that this observation is very accurate. Therefore, I am also willing to cite a few very simple and more active facts to make a commentary for him. As the person in charge of a cultural undertaking, I formally reply to the Japanese that the material part of our organization's school buildings, libraries, instruments, etc., has indeed been destroyed a lot, but the result that the Japanese planned to obtain is exactly the opposite of what they imagined. The most obvious ten examples are that, excluding the occupied areas, the number of students enrolled in schools of all levels, from elementary to university, has increased a lot compared with before the war. We have separate statistical tables published, and everyone can review them. In addition, a part of the youth who have not entered formal schools are participating in various professional training programs to become necessary technical employees in various departments of national construction. Another part, with boiling blood and strong physiques, are all put into various military training institutions, wearing military uniforms and officially carrying guns to serve as soldiers on the front line to defend the country. As for what about the youth in the occupied areas? Speaking of this, I have endless excitement and joy! I am constantly in contact with young students in Chongqing, many of whom have walked from the four northeastern provinces, or Pingjin, Hebei, Shandong and other places. Their clothes are very ragged, but their spirits are very high. They have experienced countless hunger and dangers, but their bodies and willpower have become stronger and stronger. They are no longer children who rely solely on their parents and brothers to live in ignorance. There are such young people arriving in Chongqing and other provinces and cities every day, and there are more and more of them every day. Although their number is not easy to count, taking the registration of middle school students who lost their schooling in the war zone held by the Ministry of Education in Chongqing this summer as an example, the number of people registered in just about ten days has reached three thousand, and the rest can be imagined. This is in terms of the youth who have gone from the occupied areas to the free areas. There are still more who are still in the occupied areas, their situation is more difficult, and their performance is more worthy of admiration. Those who have abandoned their families and everything they own, and are engaged in guerrilla warfare and other practical work, I really don't know how many tens of thousands there are. In other places that are known to be tough, the heroic deeds of young people are even more colorful. As for the countless students who are more gentle in nature or restricted by the environment, they reluctantly go to the schools run by the Japanese, with the sole purpose of relieving the boredom of sitting idly and gaining a little necessary knowledge. They disdain to accept graduation diplomas, and the number is already countless. Look, the Japanese are trying their best to open schools in order to conceal peace. How many people are really willing to enroll, and what kind of ideas do those who have enrolled hold? I am willing to wait for the youth in the occupied areas to answer this question themselves.</p>
<p>The above brief description really cannot exhaust one-millionth of the power that Chinese youth have shown in the war. It is only a brief explanation of the conclusions obtained by the Japanese, with a few examples to explain it. What I want to say now is why Chinese youth have this power, and what results this power will produce.</p>
<p>In answering the first question, I think that the power of Chinese youth is the power of the Chinese nation, and also the power of Chinese culture. I often say that the resistance of our Chinese nation is very majestic. The longer the time, the greater the power, the more severe the invasion, the more tenacious the resistance. From the Yellow Emperor's fight against Chi You to the present, the historical evidence is really countless. (See Student Friend, Volume 1, Issue 6). Why are we able to do this? This is because our Chinese nation has a common belief of "I love life, but I love righteousness even more; I will give up life for righteousness." With this belief, in normal times, we will unite the people of the country to spread education. In times of crisis, we will exert the great power of "unyielding in the face of force and not being corrupted by wealth and honor," and condense this belief, which is completely molded from daily life education. Our general opinion is that a person who has received education is not considered sufficient just because he can read a few books and understand a few formulas. He must first understand the principles of being a person. Conversely, if he understands the principles of being a person, even if he does not read books, he is considered to have received a complete education. The first principle is benevolence. The interpretation of benevolence is "interacting with people as a partner," that is, the way people get along with each other. If you want to be smart and superior and despise others, you cannot be a partner with others, and you will lose the reason for being benevolent. The unbenevolent are called cruel and rebellious, and the cruel and rebellious are called tyrants. Once you become a tyrant, you will do evil wherever you go, and such a person can be killed by everyone.</p>
<p>The second principle is righteousness. Righteousness is a proper behavior that is appropriate according to the place and time, that is, when there is an obstacle to human survival, it is necessary to use various methods to eliminate it, even at the cost of sacrificing life. Many people mistakenly think that the Chinese are the most easily compromised nation, and the thought of being content with one's lot permeates the entire society. In fact, this is entirely a superficial statement. It is true that the Chinese are inherently peace-loving and hate war, but hating war does not mean that they cannot fight, nor does it mean that they are afraid of war. It can be said that they are the most skilled in war. There are many historical examples, which will not be listed here. For example, in this war against Japan, our President has solemnly declared to the world: "We will never give up peace until peace is hopeless, and we will never lightly talk about sacrifice until sacrifice has reached the final moment." These two sentences express our Chinese attitude towards things in the most clear way, so when we have to sacrifice, we are reckless and will not stop until we achieve our goals.</p>
<p>The third principle is propriety. Propriety is interpreted as reason, or as practice, that is, a law that conforms to the principles of nature and responds to human feelings, and that everyone commonly follows. May I ask, in the three and a half years of war, which "organization," large or small, has been able to establish local order without leaving the Japanese forces? Originally, propriety starts with respect and ends with harmony. People who oppose the principles of nature and human feelings are fundamentally rejected in the minds of the Chinese.</p>
<p>The last principle is wisdom. Knowledge is indispensable to everyone, but knowledge is not about reading dead books and memorizing formulas. You must be able to inquire about it, think carefully about it, and distinguish it clearly, and then it is truly useful knowledge. In other words, knowledge is an aid to the first three principles of being a person. The so-called "reading the books of sages, what have you learned?" is to learn the principles of being a person. In the past, Duke Ai asked Confucius who was a good learner. Confucius replied, "There is Yan Hui, who does not transfer his anger and does not repeat his mistakes." This seems to be an irrelevant answer, but in fact Confucius meant that Yan Hui's ability to achieve not transferring his anger and not repeating his mistakes is the best concrete manifestation of his learning.

<h3>Roosevelt Submits Huge Budget to Congress, Allocating Massive Funds for Building Naval, Land, and Air Forces to Cope with Any Contingencies</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt, following his speech to Congress opposing aggressor nations today, announced an unprecedented U.S. defense expenditure. Under this "New Deal plus Defense" budget, if future circumstances do not require an increase, the U.S. will spend $25 billion within three years for defense purposes. The President (said) the government has designated an arms program for the defense of democracy. The world situation forces us to build naval, land, and air forces to be able to cope with and control any contingencies. The President strongly stated that the United States anticipates a continuous stream of expenditures in order to supply genuinely needed munitions to self-defending nations. The new defense program is preparing to establish the most modern mechanized army, with manpower rapidly increasing to about 1.5 million. The President also clearly stated that he does not intend to abandon the social principles of the New Deal while appropriating funds for this great program, and foreshadowed that the government will promulgate important new measures for private industry to prevent manpower and materials from being diverted from national defense needs. The President also hinted that armament profits will be strictly limited, saying that he believes existing laws are insufficient to cope with the profits from national defense work. The figures announced by the President for the budget from June 1941 to June 1942 estimate a total of $17,485,000,000, an increase of 79% over the previous budget, of which 62% is for national defense, an increase of 67% over the previous defense budget. The budget deficit will increase to $9,210,000,000, compared to $6,889,000,000 last year, but the President stated that there is no fear of an increase in national debt. He not only requested an immediate increase in direct taxes but also anticipated that economic activity and national income would both increase to record highs. The President's important speech included the following points: Our defense program refers to battleships, cargo ships, tanks, airplanes, and cannons to protect us against aggression. Our problem in the coming year is to protect our democracy against external pressures and internal weaknesses. No one can predict the final cost of the armament program, as it is still developing and no one can foresee its future. Currently, contracts have been signed for 125 new factories, with more in the planning stage. Goods worth $1 billion have been ordered in the past six months, resulting in factories across the country being ready to rapidly increase their production. Social security programs and agricultural programs that assist farmers will continue to be implemented. If, after this war, it is replaced by a new world where nations coexist peacefully, then the complete elimination of the arms race will be possible. Only in such a world can economic security be restored. President Roosevelt explained the budget figures at a reception for journalists, saying that loans to overseas democracies were not included in the budget because they have not yet been authorized by Congress, but that requests for approval of certain items may be made in the near future. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt submitted to Congress yesterday a budget proposal for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1942, with a total expenditure of more than $17 billion. Approximately 62% of this amount is for national defense. Thus, since June 1940, the combined figures for defense expenditures, including those allocated, approved, and proposed, have reached $28,480,000,000. The President stated that the issue of supplying munitions to all democratic nations to enable them to defend themselves must be considered immediately, and that expenditures may exceed this budget. The fiscal year 1942 budget statement shows expenditures of $17,485,000,000. If the expenditures for the aforementioned issue are included, there is a shortfall of $9,210,000,000. Furthermore, the budget appendix includes a $100,000,000 debt from the fiscal year 1940. Therefore, the total expenditure of this budget, after adding this $100,000,000, becomes $17,585,000,000. The President also stated that this expenditure is "a response to the world at war. The terrible world situation has forced us to build a huge naval, land, and air force to cope with any situation. In today's world, a lack of national defense is extremely dangerous. Only by preparing a huge and comprehensive national defense can security be obtained." (United Press, 8th)</p>

<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday organized a new supreme body to handle the rearmament program led by Mr. Knudsen, Chairman of the National Defense Commission, and labor leader Mr. Hillman. Mr. Knudsen was appointed chairman of this supreme body, and the other members are Colonel Knox and Colonel Stimson. Mr. Knudsen and Mr. Hillman are jointly responsible. President Roosevelt stated that the two will cooperate, but refused to answer questions about whether Mr. Knudsen's power is greater than Mr. Hillman's. The organization of the body was done through an executive order. This is just one of numerous executive orders. The President stated that the body has absolute power in handling events related to obtaining arms and raw materials for the country and abroad. The body will begin work today. The President also issued a statement signed by the four members of the body, saying that what the supreme body faces is not only important but also urgent. (United Press, 8th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Naval Aircraft Ranks First in the World</h3>
<p>Washington - Rear Admiral Towers, Chief of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, declared yesterday that the U.S. naval aircraft ranks first in the world and predicted that the U.S. Navy's air force will far surpass that of the Axis powers this year. According to the recent U.S. Navy air mission to Britain, the latest U.S. fighter planes are superior to British fighter planes in terms of engine power. He stated that of the 4,000 aircraft originally planned for the Navy, 2,400 are fighter planes. This number far exceeds Japan's production. The Rear Admiral also stated that the Navy hopes to have another 4,000 aircraft in 1941 and 6,300 by 1942, but he stated that he is very dissatisfied with the U.S.'s planned aircraft production. A year ago, the Navy had a total of 2,145 aircraft, and has only increased by 445 since then. Rear Admiral Towers stated that the Navy has ordered 6,122 aircraft, but apart from the 445 ordered in 1940, "very few" are the latest models. He said, "I am very impatient with the slow rate of aircraft production." (United Press, 8th)</p>

<h3>Rumors of German Troops Entering Bulgaria Abound, Soviet Black Sea Fleet Concentrates, Internal Strife Within Romanian Iron Guard Creates Political Instability, Turkey Watches Balkan Situation Develop</h3>
<p>Vichy - It is rumored that the Soviet Union's powerful Black Sea Fleet concentrated off the Bulgarian port of Varna last night. This news came at the same time as news of the initial entry of German troops into Bulgaria. According to Vichy sources that are normally reliable, the Soviet fleet is quite menacing, as it is less than 100 miles from the Bulgarian-Turkish border. Informed sources here claim that the rumored German troop movements in Bulgaria directly strike at the Soviet Union. It is rumored that German troops are currently attempting to reach Salonika and the Dardanelles, intending to prevent the Soviet Union from transporting munitions and oil to Turkey and Greece. Vichy news also states that German troops are still pouring into Romania. Government sources here generally believe the news of German troops entering Bulgaria to be credible. It is also generally believed that Germany has taken this action without the Soviet Union's consent, and that it is, in fact, against the Soviet Union's wishes. Regarding the rumor from reliable sources that the Soviet Black Sea Fleet is concentrating off the coast of Bulgaria, developments are expected within days. It is rumored that Soviet troops are continuing to concentrate on the Romanian border. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>London - London's "Daily Express" reported this morning that a Soviet battleship in the Black Sea sailed up the Danube River yesterday and anchored near Sulina. It is expected that if Germany takes new action in the Balkans, the Soviet Union will take over this port. The "Daily Telegraph" reported that there have been clashes between German and Romanian troops in the province of Moldavia. This news comes from the Romanian border. It is also reported that the Iron Guard has erupted in internal strife and is fighting fiercely. (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<p>Budapest - News arriving here today states that Soviet and German troops are increasing daily on the Romanian border, facing off across the border. Amidst this situation, internal strife erupted in Romania again last night. Under these circumstances, there are signs that the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Bulgaria may unite to resist Germany's plan to invade Bulgaria. Balkan diplomatic circles hear that as disputes increase between the Soviet Union's Bessarabia and Romania's Moldavia border, the Soviet Union may take action against Romania. Romania has been cut off from communication with the outside world for three days. Rumors circulate that the faction of the Iron Guard in Romania that supports Antonescu is engaged in fierce fighting with the extremist faction of the group, resulting in the deaths of many Iron Guard members. Terrorists and saboteurs are also quite active in Romania. Since Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov returned home after a week-long visit to Vienna, it is generally believed that Bulgaria, with the support of the Soviet Union, does not intend to change its policy of not joining the Axis. Well-informed sources say that the Turkish government has notified Bulgaria that if foreign troops enter Bulgaria, Turkey will no longer remain neutral. (International News, 8th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - News from border areas indicates that the signs of a German plan to quickly cross the Danube River into Bulgaria were fewer yesterday than on Monday. Some observers believe that the German military's action of passing through Bulgaria to open a line to Greece will be postponed until spring. Military experts say that the troops and supplies transported from Germany are concentrated in major towns on the southern border of Romania. This concentration of troops is sufficient to provide military assistance to Italy in its operations against Greece when necessary. Unconfirmed reports were received here yesterday morning that German troops had entered Bulgaria and occupied several Bulgarian mountain passes. Diplomatic circles are unwilling to believe this, and military authorities also do not believe it. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>German and Soviet Forces Face Off, Bulgarian Situation Delicate, Bulgarian Premier Returns to Capital from Vienna, Denies Holding Negotiations with Germany</h3>
<p>Stockholm - A newspaper here states that, according to news from Berlin, it is expected that there will be no new negotiations or agreements between Germany and Bulgaria.

(Recently, there were rumors that Filov was ill and would leave Bulgaria to seek medical treatment.) The dispatch also states that German and Soviet interests cannot be reconciled in Bulgaria. If Bulgaria refuses German demands, it will likely rely on the support of the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia - Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov returned to the capital yesterday afternoon from Vienna. Filov said, "The news reported by the United States about my visit to Germany is not accurate."

<h3>Founder of the Boy Scouts, Baden-Powell, Passes Away</h3>
<p>London - It was announced here today that Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the Boy Scouts, passed away at his residence in Kenya at the age of eighty-three. Lord Baden-Powell was born in London in 1857 and was fond of various sports from a young age, excelling above other children. In 1876, he considered pursuing a religious career, following in his father's footsteps, but later changed his mind and took the army entrance exam, which he passed. He then served in South Africa and other places, where he distinguished himself in battle. In 1908, he initiated the Boy Scout movement to fulfill his long-held aspirations. In 1910, he retired from the military to devote himself fully to Boy Scout affairs. Soon, the Boy Scout movement spread worldwide. In 1920, the first World Scout Jamboree was held in London, with participants from twenty-seven countries. He was elected as the Chief Scout of the World. In 1912, he married Miss Olave Soames, and his wife later engaged in organizing the Girl Guides, now serving as the Chief Guide of the World. It has been known that his Lordship has been ill for some time. Several months ago, there were rumors that he had passed away in Kenya, but it was later found to be incorrect. However, due to his advanced age and the ineffectiveness of medicine, the sad news has now been officially announced. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3>Random Thoughts on the European War (20) (9) - British Officer's Diary on the Western Front</h3>
<p>Some time ago, I went to inspect the front line at Sedan. I firmly believed that if our side could resolutely resist with a disciplined army, the German army would have to pay a price of 500,000 casualties to break through our lines. But what happened? The fortifications were layered deeply, extending five miles, yet the German army drove straight through with a loss of only 500 men. The reason for this can only be attributed to the fact that the defenses of Sedan, which were considered the strongest, were defended by the weakest troops. The majority of the defenders were Parisians with the worst morale. When the Stuka dive bombers arrived, there were actually not many casualties. They only endured two hours before fleeing like frightened old women, covering their ears with their hands. It is no wonder that the officers of the general staff shed tears.</p>
<p>We immediately took emergency measures. The Air Force Commander had obtained the consent of General Gort, Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, General Gamelin, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, and General Georges, Chief of Staff of the French Army, to request the British Cabinet to urgently dispatch the Home Defence Bomber Squadron to France to assist in the battle and salvage the situation, but it was not implemented. The Air Force Commander, with the approval of the General Headquarters, dispatched four squadrons of fighter planes from the Air Force to escort the bombers. Modern warfare is indeed rapidly changing, and we are all anxiously waiting.</p>
<p>General Sweeney, Director of the Second Department of the Military Liaison Group, had already made arrangements with the General Headquarters. The Bomber Command promised to dispatch 100 aircraft under the command of the Air Force, which should satisfy General Georges. However, the Air Force Commander had lost the opportunity to deal a severe blow to the enemy. The major effort to boost morale and the important decisions mentioned above were all too late. The plan to inflict a fatal blow on the enemy was never implemented. Caution and safety first caused us to miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>10:00 PM: Seventy bombers, escorted by several fighter planes, "participated in the battle at Sedan. They flew very low and lost 37 aircraft. But they have accomplished their operational goals. The three pontoon bridges built by the Germans have all been destroyed. The French counterattack has even recovered the high ground around the salient, achieving a local success."</p>
<p>General Georges plans to launch a second counterattack tomorrow in the hope of retaking Sedan. The French army is prepared to participate in the battle with 60 bombers, and the British Bomber Command has also decided to launch another large-scale attack.</p>
<p>May 15: No need to say more, I'll record it again tomorrow. It was only this afternoon that 26 German aircraft bombed the railway, and an hour later, I went out to inspect the damage. The bombs dropped by the German aircraft were mostly delayed-action bombs, and they are now beginning to explode. The German aircraft dropped bombs quite accurately, causing severe damage. The station has caught fire.</p>
<p>At breakfast, I read the newspaper. The situation is quite worrying. The enemy has crossed the Meuse River along a fifty-mile line from Dinant to Sedan. But as of this moment, the German army seems to be confined to the left bank of the river. The Ninth Army is resisting at Sedan. In the direction of Dinant, our counterattack has recovered some lost ground.</p>
<p>This morning, a large number of refugees passed through here, most of them riding bicycles, and some in dilapidated vehicles. In the morning, the railway was heavily bombed by enemy aircraft. I was shaving when a large iron bomb flew over my head with a whooshing sound and landed only a foot away. Everything is very depressing, but perhaps not hopeless. The war is still in its early stages, and there is no reason to despair, but the French army here is clearly disappointing. According to unofficial talks, there is talk of the French army retreating to the Aisne River. But I don't understand how the French army and the British army on the left wing will maintain contact. This question needs to be answered now.</p>
<p>2:00 PM: The news from the British army seems to be good. Just now, news came that the commander of the Seventh Army has come south to take over the Ninth Army. The commander of the Ninth Army has been "dismissed" and it is rumored that he has been executed, but I don't know if this is true.</p>
<p>The story of the fall of the Maastricht bridge is like a myth. A man dressed as a civilian walked to the east side of the bridge and asked the guards in a friendly manner to let him pass to say a few words to a companion on the west side of the bridge. The guards agreed, and he crossed the bridge, spoke for a few minutes, and then walked back with his friend, approaching the guards. The second person suddenly struck the guard dead like an assassin and ran back to the west side of the bridge, cutting the fuse of the land mine that had been buried. At the same time, the person on the east side grabbed the deceased guard's weapon to prevent others from interfering. The accuracy of the German army's timing is truly astonishing. Within a few minutes, paratroopers and gliders were descending from the sky, landing on top of the Dutch and Belgian fortifications on the west side of the bridge. While the defenders were still confused, the German army had surrounded the fortifications, throwing hand grenades into the observation holes and bombs onto the gun emplacements. In a short time, a fortification had become a living hell, with bombs thrown into the open doors and turrets. In less than an hour, the German army had occupied the bridgehead at Maastricht. According to our estimates, the German army would have to sacrifice 50,000 men to succeed, but now they have only lost 300 men!</p>
<p>Sedan fell due to air force bombing. The French army's retreat was cut off and they collapsed two hours later. The bridgehead at Maastricht was taken by the enemy silently. This is what military strategists call the clever use of surprise.</p>
<p>Finally, some good news came. It is said that the British army has launched a successful counterattack in Leuven. Although this is not credible, it may boost morale somewhat. I am afraid that the French army has given up the idea of ​​recovering the Meuse River positions. French tactics seem to be very different from their traditional spirit.</p>
<p>8:00 PM: The French military report is extremely bad. The German army has expanded its foothold on the left bank of the Meuse River. From Chinley to somewhere below Sedan, the whole area is full of German troops and has advanced west to La Roche. La Roche is north of Laon, only forty miles from our army's headquarters in Sernay.</p>
<p>10:00 PM: General d'Astier has closed the headquarters and left in a hurry. The situation is extremely urgent. We have also decided to retreat and plan to go to the British Air Force headquarters with the Air Force Commander at 3:00 tomorrow morning. These three hours are extremely hectic. All important items, such as steel filing cabinets, map cases, wall charts, typewriters, and desks, are being packed into the headquarters' transport vehicles. Everyone's boxes and luggage are also all packed by 1:30, and even the remaining half bottle of cherry wine is taken along.</p>
<p>May 16: I, Wu Daoer, Ock Bowler, and driver Hogen drove to the British Air Force headquarters in the town of Coromée at 10:00 PM. In addition to our personal pistols, we carried two rifles, but they would be useless if we encountered enemy tank units. The retreat of the advance headquarters of the British Air Force in the north has now been completed.</p>
<p>This morning, things are very clear. If the French army had the will to fight, or if their morale had not completely collapsed, the Allied forces would still have hope of victory. The German army broke into the French army's lines, forming a wide salient. Their forces are exhausted, and there cannot be a large amount of supplies and fuel nearby. In the past, Napoleon III's army was completely defeated in the Battle of Sedan. If the French army could attack the left flank of the German army to cut off this protruding point, it might be possible to turn defeat into victory and have the German army meet the same fate as Napoleon III.</p>
<p>There is no quick decision in the UK either. We desperately need 200 fighter planes to counter the German bombers, but the authorities do not attach importance to them. The Air Force Department said that they would reconsider the urgent requests of the past two days. As in the last European war, defending London is often considered more important than defending France. In my personal opinion, the only justifiable excuse for France to complain about Britain is the lack of fighter plane assistance.</p>
<p>Today, we talked to a French officer who described how the French army defending Sedan and the German bombing destroyed their resistance. He said that the French army had been psychologically conquered and could not hold out. We have heard this more than once. This situation is all caused by dive bombers. Dive bombers can be checked by fighter planes. If we had 500 aircraft to counter the enemy fighter planes, Sedan could have been kept. The Cabinet may not know anything about what happened yesterday, but I think they will change their policy. From the newspapers, it seems that the British public is not depressed by the defeat. We all remember the Battle of the Marne in the last European war, so we all have the dream that history may repeat itself. (To be continued)</p>

Wang Hongbin's performance last night was still up to par, with his finger skills and fancy moves still pleasing to the eye. His left-corner turnaround jump shot was truly remarkable.

<h3>Grains: Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 and Siam Rice Still Operating Secretly Off-Market; Local Rice Finally Declines by One to Two Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Imported rice prices are still being held up by those hoarding goods, but with continuous arrivals and crowded orders, the original packaged selling price of the returned Yinghua company has seen a sharp drop. Therefore, the spot price of Xiaojiao has already opened for sale at the limited price of 79 yuan, and the secondary price is 78 yuan. Due to the ongoing period of price controls, the actual sales of broken rice and rice tea are sluggish, and sellers have been unable to raise prices again, so they can only be sold within the limited price range. However, there is still a lack of official transactions for Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 and Siam No. 1 and No. 2 fire-polished rice, etc., and they are still operating secretly. There are still rumors of off-market surcharges and allocated prices. New transactions for imported rice orders have not been agreed upon due to the high exchange rate cut, but the cut price can still be transported, and foreign merchants are also soliciting sales. Moreover, the previously ordered rice is also arriving one after another. Therefore, the returned original packaged rice continues to trend downward. This is because people's hearts are calm, new hoards are waiting and watching, and those with floating profits are quite intending to close out within the year. Therefore, the spot price of Xiaojiao rice is only opened at 93 yuan, while Saigon rice has arrived at the original package with its own expenses only opened at 96 yuan, and the transfer freight is only 98 yuan, a sharp drop of three to five yuan compared to the previous market. That is, the land cargo of Xiaojiao rice in mid-January is also only 83 yuan, a decrease of one yuan compared to the previous day. Special rice opened at 77 yuan, then 75 and a half yuan, 75 yuan. Broken pointed rice is as high as 74 yuan, then down to around 70 yuan, and sun-dried rice is only 66 to 67 yuan. The total volume of returned original packages throughout the day was more than 500 tons, and there are less than 3,000 bags of spot goods.</p>
<p>The arrival of national rice such as thick and thin japonica rice is still sporadic. However, most cargo owners, seeing that imported rice seems to be weakening and declining straight, no longer have the heart to hold on and have become more willing to sell. At the same time, the wooden street stores are unwilling to prepare much due to the high price pressure, and the sales route has also suddenly weakened. Under these double circumstances, the selling price suddenly fell by one or two yuan. For example, Kunshan hu saw that white japonica rice, except for high-quality goods, still requires around 105 yuan, while those in the middle range are only 101 to 103 yuan. Qingjiao hu saw that thin indica rice, a large market cargo, has already entered the 100 yuan mark, selling for 98 to 99 yuan, but high-quality goods sell for 101 to 100 yuan, and the original package is 104 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales route for glutinous rice is originally the most sought after. At this time, with other goods all showing fatigue, the market color becomes even more sluggish, and the price continues to fall by the yuan. Yili white opened at 92 yuan to 90 yuan, Hong Kong goods opened at 81 yuan, then down to 78 yuan, glutinous indica ordinary 72 and a half yuan, then down to around 70 yuan.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the source of imported rice arrives, one after another. Yesterday, the Taikoo company's Taiyuan wheel transported 8,439 bags from Hong Kong, stopped at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload. Also, the French company's Jindiya arrived yesterday morning, transporting 6,026 bags of imported rice directly from Saigon, and another 7,459 bags of corn, stopped at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou to unload. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Plenty of Imported Flour Arriving in Shanghai; Flour Prices Still Rising</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market saw a slight rebound. Hua Flour Factory set a price of 21 yuan and 5 jiao, selling as usual at a fair price until the end of the lunar year, and then determining a new method. The selling price of imported flour once fell, but yesterday morning, when the market opened, the general hoarding hands no longer sought to sell in the market due to the sharp rise in the gold market the night before. Moreover, it was heard that the Nanyang gang slightly moved, and people's hearts immediately turned for the better. The wild brand shouted a price of 24 yuan and 5 jiao, the Beautiful brand rose from 24 yuan and 2 jiao to 24 yuan and 3 and a half jiao, and the Flower Crow Clock Tower was the most popular, also rising from 24 yuan and 1 and a half jiao to 24 yuan and 2 and a half jiao. The later market shouted two jiao higher again. However, at present, all the goods are in the hands of retail investors, who often hold on, and the price fluctuates suddenly, making the market unstable.</p>
<p>Imported flour is arriving in Shanghai continuously. In addition to the 9,000 bags brought by the Yihua Yusheng wheel and the 5,000 bags brought by the Taikoo Jiangsu wheel the day before yesterday, which have been recorded in previous reports, it is learned that yesterday the Taikoo company's Taiyuan arrived in Shanghai, in addition to transporting a large number of imported rice, also transported 23,587 bags of imported flour from Hong Kong. It is estimated that in only one week this year, more than 27,000 bags of imported flour have been imported.</p>
<p>Wheat: There was still no transaction yesterday. At this time of scarcity of arrivals and inventories, there were occasional scattered transactions, only a few hundred bags, and the selling price still stood at around 35 yuan. Japanese factories also had no goods to receive at the store, and the market did not escape the situation of holding on.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC's listing had no ups and downs. The English and American exchange dark market was quiet. The various rumors that were spread the day before have disappeared today and are no longer heard. Although there was a speculative need after the morning news, HSBC and others were quite willing to supply it. American banks and other foreign banks were all selling, and the market was relaxed. This month's US exchange rate was generally done at 5 yuan 5625. However, until before the close, there were suddenly small amounts of inward households seeking to buy, and the price turned flat. As a result, English gold was flat, at three pence and a half, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan 53125, a contraction of 03125.</p>
<p>HSBC has a lot of supply</p>

The central listing of each exchange rate remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was three and a half pence for English gold and five and a half yuan for the US exchange rate, which was the same as the late closing price of the previous day. After the opening, it was heard that speculators first had the intention of entering, but soon the English bank HSBC was willing to supply it, and the market immediately showed a steady and hard state. It is estimated that HSBC sold this month's US exchange rate to foreign banks for five and a half yuan, and at 9:30, HSBC's listing announcement did not move, and the silver tax was also flat. Since then, American banks have squeezed out the US exchange rate for January from five yuan 53125 to 5625, and the advance order was made at three pence 515625. Before noon, the Huashang Bank's interbank transaction of this month's US exchange rate was all at 5 yuan 5625. By the time of closing, a few buyers slightly clawed, and the market situation was quiet and stable. As a result, the spot and this month's English gold was two and a half pence, and the US exchange rate was 5 yuan 53125. Next month's English gold was three pence 484375, and the US exchange rate was five and a half yuan, compared to the closing of the day before yesterday, the English was flat and the US was hard 03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate slightly increased</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 8th (Wednesday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with no ups and downs in the exchange rates of English, American and Japanese currencies (the spot price of the US exchange rate closed at 23 yuan 625 yesterday), and the spot price of Shanghai currency rose by one yuan to 427 yuan (the closing price yesterday was 426 yuan). At 11:30, it was announced that the market was flat, and there were no changes in each exchange rate. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tianjin English loose American shrink</p>

<h3>Rumor Wind Has Stopped, Gold Market Sales Frustrated</h3>

However, the argument among the industry is that the current double horse yarn is relatively too high, and the miscellaneous brand yarn seems too cheap, and the price difference between the same 20 yarn is between 100 and 200 yuan, but the speculative target is to eat heavily in the double horse for伸縮.

<h3>Cotton Market Mediocre</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is worse than yesterday, and the factory's办胃 is particularly astringent. In addition, the sales of cotton yarn are narrow, and there is very little development for raw materials, so the future of the cotton market is still difficult to昂昇.</p>
<p>Another message is that the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is firm, first because of the purchase of speculators, and then because of the purchase of the same industry, the result is that the closing price is 67 pounds higher than the previous day's音. India, together with the forecast, rose by more than one罗比.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has continued to be lackluster in recent days, and the purchase intention of all parties is particularly quiet. The industry is also taking a wait-and-see attitude, but the general expectation is that the cotton market will not be weak.</p>

<h3>Metals - Both Japanese Nails and Wire Rods Weak</h3>
<p>The market conditions for Japanese nails and new wire rods, which had been rising sharply for some time, have felt noticeably slack in recent days. The reason for this is that actual sales are sluggish and transactions are sparse. Additionally, the approaching end of the accounting period is also affecting actual sales, causing a lack of confidence among those in the trade and leading to a weakening trend in prices. Yesterday, the price for Japanese nails was quoted at 72.20 yuan per barrel, but actual transactions were made at 70 yuan, and some were even being sold off. The market price for new wire rods was 76 or 77 yuan per dan (a unit of weight), a slight decrease of three to four yuan compared to previous levels.

<h3>Repeated Demands for Improved Treatment - British Tramways Halt Service Yesterday - Company Has Accommodated Demands as Much as Possible - Inconvenience to Transportation, All Parties Hope for a Quick Resolution - Rumor of Tramway Workers Resuming Work This Morning</h3>
<p>Workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company in the International Settlement, having proposed conditions for improved treatment, with workers from the Baikai Road and depot machine workers taking the lead by engaging in go-slow action the day before yesterday, from yesterday morning, the engine, vehicle, and depot workers have completely gone on strike, resulting in the complete cessation of all streetcar services. The company has responded to the conditions proposed by the workers, and there are reports that some have advised the workers to resume work first and await resolution. Tramway workers have accepted the advice and are expected to resume work this morning.</p>
<p>Strike Again - Tram Service Halted</p>
<p>On September 20th of last year, workers of the tramway company staged a strike over improved treatment. Fortunately, through the mediation of Yu Qiaqing and others, a resolution was reached, and workers resumed work on the 28th. Today, all workers, seeing the recent soaring rice prices and insufficient wages to maintain a livelihood, have once again proposed conditions for improved treatment. Coppersmiths at the Baikai Road depot took the lead in a go-slow action the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, all of the more than two thousand engine and vehicle workers responded completely, unanimously going on strike, causing all streetcars and trackless trolleys within the Public Settlement to be forced to stop operating and completely cease service. At the same time, French trams also ceased operating into the Public Settlement.</p>
<p>Conditions Proposed - Five Items</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the workers yesterday that the five conditions proposed by the tramway workers for improved treatment are: (1) A uniform wage increase of 50% for all vehicle and engine workers. (2) An annual bonus of one-tenth of a year's salary (including wages, subsidies, rice subsidies, etc.) and a year-end special bonus of one month's salary. (3) Monthly wage increases for drivers and coppersmiths should be the same as those for ticket sellers: four workers. (4) The company should deduct one yuan for the workers' welfare fund paid to the union when paying wages. (5) Additional ticket-selling personnel should be added to the 14th and 15th trackless trolley lines. The above five items have been formally submitted by the workers to the company authorities.</p>
<p>Company Depot - Tightly Protected</p>
<p>After the workers went on strike, the company's manager, Bowler, accompanied by the tramway superintendent and the Chinese compradore, Hu Zi, inspected the Jing'an Temple station and the Baikai Road main depot yesterday morning. At the same time, the Public Settlement police authorities, in order to protect the company and the depot and maintain order, yesterday dispatched additional detectives from various police stations to station at the company headquarters on North Suzhou Road, the Jing'an Temple station on Hardoon Road, and the Baikai Road main depot, taking strict precautions to prevent incidents. At the same time, the political department has sent detectives to investigate the truth of the strike in order to allow the industrial department to find a way to mediate.</p>
<p>The Company's Response - Considered Satisfactory</p>
<p>The company has responded to the workers' demands and hopes that the workers will first resume work to maintain public transportation. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who inquired with the workers yesterday, the company has agreed to submit the first item, a 50% wage increase, to the company's board of directors for discussion and decision. For the second item, the bonus, the company agreed to pay an annual bonus of one one-hundred-and-twentieth of a year's salary, but calculated on wages, excluding various subsidies, and agreed to allow workers to borrow three weeks' wages in advance at the end of the year. For the third item, the wage increase, the company agreed to consider it further and then discuss it. For the fourth item, the withholding of union dues, the company agreed to discuss and resolve it. For the fifth item, the addition of ticket sellers, the company agreed to hand it over to the vehicle department for handling.</p>
<p>All Sectors Hope for a Rational Resolution</p>
<p>According to a Western employee of the tramway company yesterday, the company increased workers' wages last October, and the reason for this renewed strike is unknown, which is extremely surprising. In addition to increasing wages by 150% last year, living allowances, rice subsidies, and housing subsidies were also given. The company is determined to do its best to help workers solve their livelihood problems, but the workers' actions have made the company unbearable. The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the workers did not state the reasons for the strike, which shows that someone must be inciting political unrest behind the scenes, but striking near the New Year also seems to lack a reason. However, both parties agreed last year to give an additional 50% bonus, and all sectors hope for a rational resolution to this.</p>
<p>Tramway Workers - Rumored to Allow Resumption of Work</p>
<p>Tramway workers accepted advice yesterday and agreed to resume work starting this morning. However, some engine workers expressed dissatisfaction with the company's response and did not agree to resume work immediately. The workers' side has advised all workers separately, planning to resume work first this morning to maintain public transportation within the Settlement. At the same time, the company's Chinese compradore, Hu, went to the Jing'an Temple station on Hardoon Road yesterday to advise the workers, urging them to resume work first and then find a way to resolve the conditions. According to Mr. Yu, a representative of the workers, who met with a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency last night, resumption of work is expected this morning.</p>
<p>Workers' Conflict - Two Injured</p>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, a large number of workers gathered at the Jing'an Temple station on Hardoon Road. After receiving the news, the Jing'an Temple police station, fearing an accident, immediately dispatched a large number of detectives and three police cars to take precautions. It was reported that during the process of workers sending representatives to advise workers to resume work, an unfortunate incident of conflict between workers and workers occurred. Engine worker Wang Axiao and vehicle worker Li Lansheng were injured and were immediately sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road by ambulance for treatment. It is reported that the injuries were minor and not life-threatening.</p>
<p>Abrupt Incident - Passengers Suffer</p>
<p>After all trams in the Public Settlement stopped operating, all trams on the five routes in the French Concession and trackless trolleys on the 24th, 17th, and 18th routes stopped operating into the Public Settlement. Due to the abruptness of the incident, most passengers waited at the station for a long time before reluctantly leaving. The number of passengers on public buses suddenly increased sharply. The British-owned public bus company added all the buses in the depot to operation, but it still could not reduce the crowded situation.</p>
<h3>Relief for Shaoxing Rice Famine - Food Company Organized</h3>
<p>According to sources from Shaoxing people in Shanghai, the rice famine in Shaoxing has become increasingly severe since the winter. Due to traffic obstruction and poor sources, there is less and less rice stored in the market, and there is even a shortage of rice everywhere. In order to relieve the urgent need for food, all parties have organized a food company to purchase rice in groups, with a planned capital of one million yuan, which will be recognized by the business community and various urban and rural districts and towns according to the size of the population. At present, 300,000 yuan of commercial shares, 100,000 yuan from the Men Anchang district, 50,000 yuan from Dongguan, and 200,000 yuan from other sectors have been raised, totaling 650,000 yuan, which has exceeded more than half. Other districts are still working hard to raise funds, and it is expected that the full amount will be reached in mid-month, and the company will be formally established to purchase rice from Shangjiang County in Zhejiang Province and transport it to provide relief. The serious situation can be reduced.</p>

The trial was presided over by Lang Ge, Secretary of the Consular Corps. The defendant, the Municipal Council, was represented by lawyer Bo Liangjin, who strongly refuted the plaintiffs and involved the Chongqing government and the Shanghai Bar Association, accusing the plaintiffs of intending to use political power to seek a victory. The plaintiffs mostly refused to answer because the questions asked by the defendant's lawyer were mostly outside the scope of the case, and only stated that the Municipal Council had no right to levy land tax on unregistered land according to the regulations of the Yangjingbang land. As a result, the trial was adjourned to 2:30 p.m. today for retrial.</p>

However, there are still 13,250 bags of No. 2 Gong rice from the 22nd to 29th batches that Shenji Foreign Company commissioned from October 4th to November 14th, and only 4,532 bags were loaded last year. 8,718 bags have not yet been shipped to Shanghai. According to the association's report yesterday, the above-mentioned 8,718 bags of Gong rice have been loaded onto the "Granlund" of the Hualun Foreign Company and left Gong on the 5th of this month, and are expected to arrive in port around the 17th of this month. At that time, it will be distributed to the 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, and 27th batch of subscribers.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Sharply - Deaths from Starvation Increase Daily</h3>
<p>The climate in Shanghai has been extremely warm in recent days, as if it were autumn. Although there are few deaths from freezing among beggars and poor people who are homeless on the streets, there are quite a few deaths from starvation. According to the records of the Pushan Villa the day before yesterday, a total of 36 adult corpses and 43 child corpses were collected. The soaring rice prices pose a serious threat to the lives of the poor.</p>
<h3>Five Labor Disputes - Gradually Resolved</h3>
<p>Guangci Labor Dispute Begins Mediation - Postal Workers Ask to Await Reply</p>
<p>The labor strike by all employees of Guangci Hospital demanding improved treatment has suddenly lasted for ten days. More than a dozen new workers have also left the hospital one after another. All parties have donated to the labor side. The political department of the French police has taken on mediation and is gradually making progress. At the same time, the Catholic Huiliangji Bishop also sympathizes with the hardships of the hospital workers and, seeing that most of the labor side are Catholics, cannot bear to sit idly by while this unfortunate labor dispute persists. He has also advised the hospital director, Father Wan Erdian, and representatives of the labor side to resolve the matter as soon as possible. It is rumored that a satisfactory resolution and resumption of work may be achieved within this week.</p>
<p>Orphanage</p>
<p>The labor dispute involving more than 1,000 employees of the Xujiahui Tushan Bay Orphanage occurred on the 3rd of this month and has now been resolved. The original rice subsidy of 4 yuan and 5 jiao has been abolished. Each worker receives an additional rice subsidy of two dou per month, and one dou for children. On the 6th, all employees of the printing department and the distribution department resumed work first. The coppersmiths' workshop continued to resume work, while the carpenters' workshop has been temporarily closed, with priests introducing other opportunities to the carpenters. The drawing department has changed from contracting to piecework.</p>
<p>Convent</p>
<p>All the female workers of the Xujiahui Convent established by the Catholic Church and all the female school workers of the Xuhui Girls' Middle School and Elementary School have requested improved treatment and higher wages because their monthly wages are only three or four yuan. Because no results have been obtained, a go-slow action has occurred. Yesterday, the hospital and the Xuhui authorities were said to have agreed to increase wages as appropriate, but they must first resume work and wait for a solution, so that it will not expand.</p>
<p>Commercial Dispute</p>
<p>The labor-management dispute at the Commercial Press has not yet made any progress. The labor side sent three representatives to Hong Kong some time ago to directly request from the person in charge in Hong Kong. It is heard that they have not obtained any results and will return to Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Annual Bonus</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration's postal workers will be issued an annual bonus of one month's salary, according to the order of the General Post Office, which will be issued according to salary. This is the same for postal workers all over the country. However, postal workers in Shanghai requested that the administration issue the bonus based on salary plus living allowance because of the difficulty of living. The Shanghai Administration immediately telegraphed the Kunming General Post Office for instructions and followed the instructions. Fortunately, the postal workers were able to understand this real situation, so they continued to work as usual before receiving a reply from the General Post Office, which did not affect the receipt and dispatch of mail in the society.</p>
<h3>Tax on White Russian Emblem Proceeds - Large Sum Obtained - Now Used to Shelter Beggars</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the Shanghai White Russian Emigrant Committee has announced a tax on the income of White Russian emigrants, and the proceeds have expanded the charitable work among White Russians. A new White Russian beggar shelter has been set up near Tangshan Road and Yanping Road. At present, only 25 people are being sheltered. The White Russian Emigrant Committee is also looking for suitable housing in the French Concession to set up another White Russian beggar shelter. The collection of income tax is currently proceeding "satisfactorily." About 5,000 yuan was collected in November, and about 8,000 yuan may be collected in November.</p>
<h3>More Than 1,000 Poor People in the Winter Shelter</h3>
<p>The winter shelter organized by the Charity Organization United Relief Association has now sheltered more than 1,100 poor people since it was organized in the open space of Yan's house on Zhaofeng Road last month. The shelter provides two meals of white rice per day, one jin per meal, which is enough to fill their stomachs.</p>
<h3>The So-Called Shanghai West Temporary Agreement - Rumored to be Signed in the Short Term - The Municipal Council Did Not Approve the Agreement Yesterday</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post says that according to sources from the "City", the temporary agreement between the Municipal Council and the "City Government" has been revised and will be signed finally in the near future. The revised temporary agreement has been submitted to the Ning side and is expected to be returned in a few days, and then preparations for signing will begin. It is heard that the revised agreement is not significantly different from the basic agreement signed by Fancrin, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, and the "City" side in February of last year. The methods agreed upon by both sides regarding police and taxation are expected to be implemented soon, and then negotiations on the jurisdiction of the Chinese-French Court in the First Special District will be carried out. The Japanese newspaper reported today (the 8th) that the Municipal Council will hold a regular meeting this afternoon to consider the draft agreement between the Council and the "City Government" regarding police powers in the Western District, and will approve it. This draft agreement will also be approved by the Ning side next week. By then, the three-year-old case between the Municipal Council and the "City Government" will come to an end.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Meeting - Not Passed</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Council held a meeting to discuss the "temporary agreement" on the organization of "joint police powers" in the area where roads are built across the boundary. As a result, it has not yet been passed. A spokesperson for the Municipal Council told reporters yesterday that this plan still needs to be considered carefully and that there is no decision in sight. The spokesperson did not explain whether the Municipal Council had to postpone the discussion due to insufficient time or for other reasons. He only said that this matter has not yet been decided, and he did not say when the second meeting to discuss this matter will be held. Major Bowden, the head of the police department, also attended the Municipal Council meeting yesterday. Afterwards, he told reporters that he could not say whether this "agreement" could be signed and established in the near future, because this matter is no longer in his hands.</p>

<h3>Imminent Increase in Contributions by the Public Works Department; All Sectors Find Burden Unbearable; Decision of Taxpayers' Meeting Highly Valued; The Bureau Announces Difficult Financial Situation</h3>
<p>To compensate for its 20 million yuan deficit, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, upon the proposal of the Chairman of the Public Works Department, the Consular Body has scheduled a special meeting of taxpayers at 2:30 pm on the 23rd of this month at the Race Club on Bubbling Well Road to pass a further 40% increase in contributions. Chinese and foreign taxpayers believe that since the Incident, the Public Works Department has frequently increased taxes and contributions, and the public burden has already become very heavy. At a time when prices are high and the economy of citizens is on the verge of bankruptcy, another increase in contributions is like draining the pond to catch all the fish. The future is worrying and unbearable to imagine. Therefore, all parties attach great importance to the discussion of the increased contributions at the special taxpayers' meeting on the 23rd of this month and agree that all sectors of the Chinese community, because they cannot bear the burden, will show a firm opposition.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Public Works Department's Increase in Contributions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Works Department issued an article stating the reasons for the increased contributions, detailing the financial shortfall. The full text is recorded as follows: The special taxpayers' meeting is about to be held. The convocation of this meeting is specifically to discuss the Bureau's proposed collection of a 40% surcharge on taxes and the increase in various license fees. This article is specially written to explain the reasons for the increased contributions to inform the taxpayers.</p>
<p>Financial Situation Fully Recorded in the Report</p>
<p>The budget for the Bureau's expenses for this year has not yet been submitted to the relevant committees for review. However, the financial needs are now very clear. The first thing to understand is that unless public safety and sanitation are impaired, it is impossible to continue to save expenses through reorganization or restriction of various administrations or dismissal of staff. The Bureau has established an independent Economic Committee, which has met many times during this municipal year. Its report has been published in detail in the Bureau's gazette. Taxpayers are invited to consult and study it. In the future, the Bureau's expenses, whether increased or decreased, will depend on the level of prices and exchange rates. These factors directly affect the temporary living allowance paid to employees.</p>
<p>Huge Shortfall in Regular Expenses</p>
<p>When the budget for the previous year was prepared, it was felt that the increase in various expenses was greater than the income. Therefore, the surcharge on taxes was increased by 50%. However, the increase in contributions was only implemented in the second half of the year. It was expected that the income in the second half of the year could offset the expenses. At the same time, it was hoped that a balanced budget could be produced this year. However, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and rising prices, the regular expenses exceeded the original budget by about 7.8 million yuan. Although the income exceeded the budget by 4.6 million yuan, the total shortfall for the year was estimated at 8.775 million yuan (the original budget listed more than 5.573 million yuan). The above figures are rough estimates. As for the final deficit, it may be very different from the above number.</p>
<p>Increased Benefits Have a Significant Impact</p>
<p>The temporary living allowance paid to employees was 40% at the beginning of last year. By October, this allowance had been increased twice. At the same time, the rice subsidy paid to Chinese employees was also greatly increased. In addition, the cost of various human and material resources has increased sharply. Therefore, although the income is relatively abundant, it cannot match the expenditure situation. Last year, all employees expressed dissatisfaction with the salary issue. The number of foreign employees who left or resigned was estimated at 170. Later, serious unrest occurred among the Chinese police due to the issue of remuneration. As a result, the Bureau had to comprehensively consider the salaries and allowances of all employees. As a result, it was decided to increase various allowances and rice subsidies again, which cost 1 million yuan per month, of which 714,000 yuan was used for Chinese employees. Therefore, similar employees benefited more. For example, the income of a public servant in December increased by 52% compared with November, but the income of the heads of various departments in December increased by only 7% compared with November.</p>
<p>This Year's Shortfall is 20 Million Yuan</p>
<p>If the Bureau's income and expenditure situation continues in this way, the estimated deficit for this year will be around 20 million yuan, of which 12 million yuan is due to the increased allowance. Before the Bureau increased the allowance, the expenses were originally tight, and the annual deficit was only 2 million yuan. The revised method of restoring the long leave for foreign employees costs 3 million yuan per year. This expense was not listed in the budget for the previous year. In addition, the interest and principal repayment of public bonds are expected to increase by 1 million yuan compared with the previous year. In addition, the various items listed in the budget for the previous year that must be paid in foreign currency according to the contract were calculated at a rate of one yuan in national currency for four pence. The current exchange rate is lower, so this year's expenditure will cost 1 million yuan more. Based on the above reasons, the total deficit for this year is estimated to be around 20 million yuan. Therefore, the increase in contributions cannot be delayed. If it is delayed until April of this year, the amount of the previous increase will inevitably be larger. In addition, another benefit of convening a special taxpayers' meeting for taxpayers is that the Economic Committee's proposal to increase various license fees can take effect immediately.</p>
<p>Increased Contributions Can Barely Offset the Deficit</p>
<p>If municipal general donations and land taxes are levied at a rate of one percent, 1.4 million yuan can be obtained each year. Currently, the donation rate is 27%. After increasing the surcharge by 40%, an additional 15.12 million yuan can be collected each year. In addition, after the various license fees are revised, an additional 3.5 million yuan can be collected each year. In total, an additional 18.6 million yuan can be collected each year. To offset the above deficit, it is planned to increase the valuation of real estate to make up for the shortfall. As for the estimated deficit of 8.775 million yuan in the previous year, it is planned to temporarily transfer it to the temporary expenses item and then find a way to remedy it. What taxpayers are currently asked to pay is only enough for the Bureau to meet its various expenses for this year.</p>
<h3>Welcome Dr. Baker; Date Set; January 17th at the Hong Mian Restaurant; Second Batch of Wheat and Medicine to Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>Dr. Baker, Director of the China Relief Division of the American Red Cross and Executive Director of the China International Famine Relief Commission, returned to the country last year and traveled in the United States to appeal for donations and raise 50 million yuan from the American people to relieve Chinese disaster victims. Later, he personally went to Free China to manage relief matters. His enthusiasm for relief is deeply appreciated by the Chinese people. This time, he came to Shanghai and stayed for two weeks before transferring to Chongqing via Hong Kong. More than ten charitable organizations, including the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, the Joint Charity Organization, the Jisheng Society, the China International Famine Relief Commission, and the Salvation Army, have specifically scheduled a welcome meeting at the Hong Mian Restaurant on Avenue Edward VII on the 17th of this month. At that time, in addition to expressing their gratitude to Dr. Baker, they will invite Dr. Baker to report on the situation of fundraising in the United States and his personal feelings after inspecting the rear area.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Wheat to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month</p>
<p>In addition to the 500 tons of rice and wheat transported to Shanghai by the Collinsworth Wheel on November 24th last year, the second batch of wheat, 1,000 tons, or 40,000 bags, will still be transported to Shanghai by the Collinsworth Wheel and is expected to arrive for distribution on February 5th. The wheat used to relieve the disaster areas of Su, Chang, Zhen, and Xi last year has been completely distributed. The wheat transported this time will also be used to relieve the disaster victims in the above-mentioned areas.</p>
<p>Large Batch of Medicine to be Shipped to China</p>
<p>As for the medicine, the first batch of 200 tons has been transferred to the mainland via Yangon and is being used by the China Relief Association and American hospitals. Only a small amount of quinine has arrived in Shanghai for distribution. It is now known that the second batch of medicine, 100,000 vitamin pills, is on the way and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Restricts Entry; Alternative Measures</h3>
<p>The population import restriction issued by the Hong Kong authorities will be implemented on the 14th of this month, next Monday. Shanghai merchants have close ties with Hong Kong. After the implementation of this restriction, the round trip between Shanghai and Hong Kong will be very inconvenient for merchants and travelers. Yesterday, the shipping industry in Shanghai received a telegram from Hong Kong stating that an alternative measure has been obtained for passengers traveling from Shanghai to Hong Kong. All passengers traveling to Hong Kong must pay 100 Hong Kong dollars to the shipping company, which will be transferred to the Hong Kong authorities for inspection. After verification, they will be allowed to land. Therefore, the Zhi Zha Li Jia Wheel of the Zha Hua Postal Shipping Company, which was originally scheduled to sail to Hong Kong on the 10th of this month in order to arrive in Hong Kong before the 14th, was announced by the company yesterday to be postponed to the 11th to sail to Hong Kong. At that time, passengers did not understand the truth and were dissatisfied. After the company informed them that the Hong Kong authorities had a temporary accommodation measure, the matter was resolved. As for the Jiangsu Wheel of Taikoo Company and the Minsheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson, they had already left Shanghai for Hong Kong the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the Suzhou Wheel of Taikoo Company also sailed to Hong Kong, because they had not yet received the news of the Hong Kong authorities' alternative measures and were all rushing to Hong Kong in advance.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Regular Meeting Today</h3>

<h3>China Central Telegraph Company Discovers Bomb</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that at 11:00 a.m. yesterday (7th), a bomb was found in the vent of the China Central Telegraph Company at 70 Fuzhou Road. It is said to be a hand grenade and was discovered by an employee. He immediately reported it to the Public Works Department Police Department for investigation. No clues have been found as of the night. It is understood that the China Central Telegraph Company was established after the Japanese occupied it and sends and receives telegrams from the occupied areas. Its building is currently under renovation.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Residents in Shanghai Raise Funds for the Norwegian Aircraft Fund; Over 10,000 Volunteers Trained in Canada; Air Force Established with Funds Donated from Various Places</h3>
<p>Since Norway was occupied, the national spirit has become more and more激昂, and the righteous deeds of national restoration have been actively launched. The Norwegian expatriates in various places have never forgotten their motherland. It is learned that Mr. Nordenson, the Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai, has launched a fundraising campaign to purchase aircraft and donate them for the use of the motherland's army. It is named the "Norwegian Aircraft Fund." Mr. Nordenson also earnestly appealed to the expatriates in Shanghai and friendly countries. If there are donations, they can be sent to the Norwegian Consulate at 2 Beijing Road. The Norwegian military authorities are currently training volunteer troops in Canada, numbering more than 10,000 people. Once the training is completed and they pass the examination, they will be transferred to the front line for combat. A part of them will establish an air force. The aircraft they use will be donated by expatriates from various places. The headquarters for fundraising was established in London not long ago, and branches were established in important cities around the world. The one launched by the Norwegian Consulate is one of them. The London headquarters has currently received a large number of donations from various places. Durban, South Africa, has already donated 5,000 pounds, which is enough to buy a Spitfire aircraft. The Shanghai Norwegian Consulate hopes that all expatriates in Shanghai and sailors in China, as well as sympathetic people from friendly countries, will enthusiastically donate to raise funds to purchase aircraft and strengthen the forces fighting for justice.</p>

<h3>Female Worker Unwilling to Live with Husband; Tragically Stabbed to Death by Husband; Murderer Arrested and Awaiting Sentence</h3>
<p>Xu Senlan, the owner of the Xu Jinxiang cigarette paper shop at No. 202, Lane 134, Taopeng Road, Hongkou, and a native of Ningbo, lived with his wife, Ms. Chen, in the shop. They had a daughter named Juandi, who is now 26 years old. Since she was a child of seven, she was betrothed to Yu Changkang (now 30 years old), a fellow villager, as his wife, and she went to his house to be raised as a child bride. They married in 1932 and lived together at No. 29, Lane 770, Huade Road. Yu used to be a fishmonger and also worked as a rice master at the Public Welfare Charity Hall at No. 4, Xinkang Lane, Yangzhou Road. Recently, the relationship between Yu and his wife deteriorated and became like ice and charcoal. In addition to working as a female worker at Huasheng Cigarette Company, Juandi also returned to Ningbo in a fit of anger in August last year. Yu repeatedly tried to persuade her to return, but she refused. So, at about 8:00 p.m. on September 8th last year, she hid a sharp knife and suddenly went to her parents' house. When she failed to persuade his wife to go home, she took out the sharp knife and stabbed her violently, causing about 20 injuries all over her body. The most serious was a knife wound in her left chest, which was about an inch deep, causing blood to gush out like a spring. She fell to the ground. Her father, Xu Senlan, tried to dissuade him from the middle, and his left arm was also stabbed. Seeing that he had caused trouble, Yu abandoned the knife and fled without a trace. It was reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to send Juandi and others to Hudong Hospital. However, Juandi was too seriously injured and died on the way. Her body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. At the same time, a wanted warrant was signed by the First Special Court to order her arrest. It was not until the day before yesterday that Chinese detective Huang Yufu learned that Yu Changkang was eating a wedding banquet at the Daji Building Restaurant at No. 55 Xidou Road. He then joined forces with detectives from the French Concession Police Department to arrest Yu and bring him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, prosecuted him for murder. When interrogated, Yu Changkang confessed that after his wife returned to her parents' house, he repeatedly tried to persuade her to return, but she refused and wanted to divorce him. He suddenly recalled that Juandi had repeatedly talked and drank soda with a man named Han Maoxiang. And one day, his mother-in-law and four others invited him to a teahouse on Fenzhou Road, showed him a divorce agreement, and forced him to sign it, which he refused. Unable to bear it, he bought a knife and stabbed her three times, etc. Judge Liu ruled that the defendant be detained pending a scheduled sentence.</p>
<h3>Pitifully Beautiful Western Woman Dies Destitute; Many People Were Enamored Ten Years Ago; Frozen to Death on the Street Ten Years Later</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that at dawn on the 4th of this month, the weather suddenly turned cold. A Western woman's body was found on the sidewalk in front of No. 662 Huade Road. She had already been frozen stiff. The woman was quite old, with wrinkles all over her forehead. She was wearing a dark green shirt, stockings, and Chinese-style shoes, which were tattered and unbearable, indicating that the woman had died due to poverty. However, the police could only estimate that the woman was about forty years old and five feet three inches tall, but there was no concrete clue to identify her name. Therefore, her body was taken to the public coroner's office for examination. At the same time, the public was asked to cooperate and visit the relatives and friends of the deceased in order to identify her name. After two days, there were no results. So, the last resort was used to examine her fingerprints. It was determined that the woman's name was "Tonia" and she was probably White Russian. According to the fingerprint department of the Police Department, "Tonia" was famous in Shanghai's nighttime entertainment venues ten years ago for her beauty and liveliness. There were many people who were enamored with her. However, her charm faded easily, and she became addicted to alcohol. A few years ago, she was sued in the Special District Court for causing trouble while drunk. In recent years, she became destitute and homeless. She had no one to turn to for help and finally died of cold and hunger on the roadside.</p>

<h3>Mother's Part in the Parricide Case; High Court Remands for Retrial</h3>
<p>The sensational case of the rebellious sons Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang killing their biological father Zhou Yongjie and dismembering the body in an attempt to destroy the evidence was sentenced in the first instance to Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang to death, and their mother, Zhou Jing, to two years and six months in prison for helping to destroy the body. Subsequently, the defendants were dissatisfied and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. As a result, the case was rejected. The three defendants were still unwilling to accept the decision and hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, Yang Sicheng, Jiang Pingfan, and Jiang Baoli to appeal to the Supreme Court. Their appeal briefs contained tens of thousands of words. After the investigation by the Special Court Branch of the Supreme Court was concluded, it was ruled a few days ago that the appeal of Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang was rejected, and the original death sentence was maintained. As for Zhou Jing's part, there are still doubts, and it was remanded to the Second Branch of the High Court for retrial. The death sentence of the two rebellious sons has been confirmed.</p>

<p>Talk about Freedom</p>
<h3>To a Mother Who Works as a Singer</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Not long ago, Free Talk published an article by Ms. Hua Ping, "My Mother is a Singer," which attracted the attention and response of many readers at the time. One of the readers advised Ms. Hua Ping to "choose a good husband in the future." Coincidentally, Ms. Hua Ping also sent a manuscript of "My Pre-Marriage Commandments." We feel that her views are quite correct and can be used as a reference for unmarried women in society in general. Therefore, we are publishing it here.</p>
<p>We believe that Ms. Hua Ping's mother had to work as a singer to make a living due to the oppression of society and the environment, which is an unfortunate and sympathetic thing. And her spirit of fighting for 14 years to cultivate her daughter is worthy of admiration. It's just that singers are products of a deformed society and are entertainment tools for the leisure class. It cannot be said that it is a work that contributes to society. Therefore, we hope that Ms. Hua Ping's mother, like every awakened singer, dancer, and guide girl, will have the ability to uplift herself and seek a bright and proper way out, so as to have a good influence on her family and society.</p>
<p>We know that in this society full of thorns, the resistance to proper women's occupations is very great. We also know that in today's society where women's social status has not yet been stabilized, it is a difficult and heavy task for women to be active in society, but we don't have to be discouraged by this. We don't hope for any miracles to happen. We just need to have the spirit of taking one step forward and these obstacles to women's occupations will one day collapse.</p>

<h3>My Pre-marital Admonitions</h3>
<p>— Hua Ping</p>
<p>Age increases with experience. Yesterday, when Mom was talking about me to guests, I overheard the phrase, "She's of marriageable age now."</p>
<p>Marriage, yes, advocating for early marriage has become a common opinion in China. Daughters can't eat at their parents' home for a lifetime. Eighteen years old! Some, many women, are already mothers. Although they themselves are just children, they have already tasted the pain of childbirth and the trouble of breastfeeding. Fortunately, I, at eighteen, am still a maiden. In China, which advocates for early marriage, this cannot but make me secretly rejoice.</p>
<p>Among classmates, we often unintentionally talk about marriage. We are not afraid of marriage, although we don't exactly welcome it. However, women should eventually marry, and this is something that should inevitably happen. How many mothers are anxious about their daughters' marriages, how many daughters heard their mothers reveal their own marriage news yesterday. Yes, we should be prepared, this is precisely the time for us to choose a partner. Regarding marriage, I don't feel apprehensive, I have my plans, I have my admonitions.</p>
<p>First, I don't hope that my spouse is a perfect person, I just want him to be good enough, like myself. I'm not a superhuman, and I don't need him to be superior to everything. He just needs to be like an ordinary person, with ordinary strengths, and also ordinary weaknesses. I can't marry someone who is superior to me in everything.</p>
<p>Second, I won't marry a university diploma or a doctoral title, I want real knowledge, practical skills. I don't want his educational attainment to be many times more profound than mine. Being a PhD's wife is a facade of vanity, but a disparity in knowledge is a painful reality.</p>
<p>Third, I won't marry a car or a villa in the countryside. I don't need the comfort of life and lose true love. If I want to marry the owner of a car, I must first recognize whether the car owner meets the conditions to be my spouse.</p>
<p>Fourth, I can't marry a man with different interests. I like to write, I don't want him to not read newspapers or magazines; I like to stroll in the park, I don't want my spouse to only know cards and horse racing. Even if he loves me with sincerity, I cannot marry a man with different interests.</p>
<p>Fifth, I won't marry lofty fame, I want a healthy physique and true love. I don't want to be the wife of a sickly celebrity, serving by the bedside for life; nor can I marry some minister or bank president, busy with social engagements for life, without real enjoyment of life.</p>
<p>Finally, I won't rashly marry the person I want to marry. During the courtship period, no man doesn't try to cover up his shortcomings and show deep admiration and respect. But after marriage, he arbitrarily exposes his flaws. This is perhaps the origin of "marriage is the tomb of love." Rather than rushing to the divorce court after marriage, stirring up a huge wave of family unrest, and carving deep wounds in the heart, it is better to have lengthy consideration before marriage, until you deeply understand the other person's character.</p>
<p>Let us have a long period of preparation and careful selection before marriage. Let us shout out the slogan, "Marriage is the beginning of happiness."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Childish!" Yu Kun said with a laugh, hurrying out to go on stage.</p>
<p>"Who's the adult?" Yuqin retorted him, but Yu Kun didn't hear it at all.</p>
<p>Yuqin himself has never not admitted that he is still a child, and sometimes he often plays all kinds of childish games with his fellow apprentices in the troupe, but the kind of aversion to men playing female roles hidden in his heart is growing day by day. Despite the fact that those teachers and fellow apprentices with bad intentions constantly try to make fun of him or deliberately treat him especially well, he only has disgust and hatred. He can restrain his childishness, keeping his face stern all day long like a rooster about to fight. Every time he takes the stage, hearing the lascivious cheers, he can't help but get angry; however, for three or four years, he has only been angry, not as scared as that fat man's roar. What this roar expresses is not just teasing and provocation, it simply wants to swallow him whole!</p>
<p>In recent days, these situations have constantly plagued Yuqin's nerves; although his understanding is still very naive, an unfavorable omen has been clearly revealed to him. Especially what happened this morning has further increased the melancholy in his heart.</p>
<p>"No, Mom just came, why should I think about her again?" His gaze slowly moved from the locust tree outside the window to Yu Hua's very delicate thin face, saying listlessly.</p>
<p>"Is it because of something the master told you just now that you're unhappy?" Yu Hua tilted his head, seeming to guess with great certainty.</p>
<p>This guess really hit the mark! This morning, after the entire class of more than ninety students finished practicing their skills in the yard as usual, the troupe leader, Master Song, suddenly walked up to Yuqin. A loyal, unlike a performer, purplish-red round face showed a very embarrassed expression, and he gently said to Yuqin: "Don't go back to your quarters, I have something to say to you!"</p>
<p>Yuqin couldn't help but be stunned for a moment, because he knew that if there was nothing major, the master would never talk to any student alone. He wondered if he had violated any rules? Zhao Yu Kun, who was covered in dust from falling, also turned his head in the crowd and stuck out his tongue, making a face that was even uglier than crying.</p>
<p>This is the specialty of our little clown. Whenever he makes this face, Yuqin and any classmate can't help but laugh; but today Yuqin can't laugh, he has to hold a heart that is very uneasy, and follow his master slowly into the back. (Four)</p>
<h3>The Philosophy of Striving in Life (Four)</h3>
<p>On the road of life, no one can have a moment's stop, no one can have a moment's lingering. Although the journey may be long or short, everyone must complete it. "Guest of Heaven," this is not teaching you to be passive in everything, but to teach you to use your limited time in life to strive hard!</p>

<p>The other day, I read your newspaper's London correspondence describing the value of basements during air raids. Inspired by this, I dared not hide it and offer it to readers.</p>

<h3>The Story of Hoarding</h3>
<p>— San Bing</p>
<p>I, who was worried about the high price of rice, saw the following story. Now I write it down, hoping that the pot-bellied bosses will sober up and be vigilant.</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, in the Kaifeng area, there was a wealthy man named Qin. Because he was stingy, people called him Qin Skinflint. He relied on his good calculation skills to earn a fortune. But people are never satisfied. Having a thousand, they still want ten thousand. So, they often buy cheap and sell dear, hoarding and speculating, hoping to profit. This year, his family had one thousand dan of rice stored, waiting for an opportunity to reap extra profits. The opportunity came. This autumn, there was a drought, with barren land stretching for thousands of miles, and no grain harvested. Grain prices soared step by step, and refugees in the disaster area were starving. Some people advised Qin Skinflint to sell his stored grain to stabilize the market price, and to provide some relief. Qin Skinflint grinned and said, "Such a disastrous year is rare in a lifetime. Now I happen to encounter it, how can I easily let it go? I must wait until the rice price is as high as it can be, and then sell it. At that time, I can become a great wealthy man."</p>
<p>Qin Skinflint was single-minded in becoming a great wealthy man, hoarding rice and not selling it. Tens of thousands of poor people starved to death, but his heart did not move. After half a year, the situation became even more serious. A group of desperate refugees from Shandong arrived in Kaifeng. Hearing that Qin Skinflint's family was hoarding rice, they robbed him first. They rushed into the door, and happened to run into Qin Skinflint coming out to stop them, so they killed him with a single knife. The rice was then distributed to the refugees. The local people all said, "Such an unconscionable person, suffering this fate, truly the mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly small!"</p>

<h3>After Seeing "Red Powdered Faces and Golden Spears"</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhi</p>
<p>Golden Star was established last year. Not long after its founding, it has indeed achieved the point of "strict production" in terms of its released works. At a time when yellow films were emerging, Golden Star produced more serious films with a stern attitude. This has had a good impact on the entire film industry, striving for the rise of fashion films and helping works with content and form become increasingly robust. These should not be accidental.</p>
<p>Although "Red Powdered Faces and Golden Spears" is also a period drama and a folk tale, the difference is that it has been adapted and abandoned.</p>
<p>In terms of form, "Red Powdered Faces and Golden Spears" is a period drama, but the advantage of historical dramas is that they provide new content through old forms, and being good at adaptation can further enhance the irony.</p>
<p>As for folk tales, it's not that they can't be filmed, but it depends on how they are filmed. Wu Yonggang brought Feng Menglong's story to the screen, but he completely overcame its existing shortcomings. This effort is worth noting by some directors.</p>
<p>In terms of directing techniques, there are flexible performances, and although the creation of atmosphere is not yet fully utilized, at least the connection is very clever. The director's control of actors and audience emotions is also successful.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the year of sweeping away yellow films, this gift from Golden Star is something that every lover of domestic films should sincerely accept.</p>

<h3>Erich Maria Remarque, Author of "All Quiet on the Western Front," in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Bei Li</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the film "All Quiet on the Western Front," which caused a sensation in the film industry, laid a solid foundation for the protagonist Lew Ayres in Hollywood, but now he is only filming MGM's "Call Dr. Kildare" series. At the same time, this film also made the name of the original author Erich Maria Remarque immediately famous. His work is considered a masterpiece of anti-war novels in the world literary scene.</p>
<p>Remarque was expelled by the German authorities for this reason, and has been wandering abroad for nearly twenty years. He recently visited Hollywood for a short-term investigation, and was warmly welcomed by all parties, becoming the most prominent person in Hollywood social circles.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, Remarque not only often spends time with his German friend Marlene Dietrich, but also maintains contact with the United Artists company, because his recent work Flotsam (literally translated as goods floating in the sea) is being made into a movie by them, directed by the famous John Cromwell, who has directed "Of Human Bondage" and "Abe Lincoln in Illinois".</p>
<p>Remarque does not plan to live in Hollywood for a long time, but in order to thank all parties for their warm concern and expectations, he will write various anti-war and exposé film scripts about the inside story of Germany for various film companies.</p>
<h3>Zhangtai Willow</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>The maid said, "We asked him, but he wouldn't say his name directly. He seemed to say his surname was 'Shi'." As soon as Liu Rushi heard that the uninvited guest's surname was Shi, she felt a sudden stirring of old memories. She nodded and said, "Why is that man so persistently unclear? I have no choice but to see him. You can first lead him to the inner study and have him sit down and treat him well." The maid readily agreed and went downstairs. Liu Rushi put down her book, stood up in her delicate body, changed her outer garment, and gracefully went downstairs. When she arrived outside the inner study, she saw that there were several male and female servants standing there to wait. Liu Rushi waved her hand and said, "There's no need for so many people to stand guard, only the maid Bitao is needed here, the rest can retreat and wait for my call." The family members agreed and retreated. Liu Rushi lifted the curtain and entered, and saw a burly man with a curly beard sitting cross-legged on the kang, drinking a cup of tea. Who else could it be but Shi Da, whom she met by the Rainbow Pavilion in the past? Although his appearance has not changed much, his face is full of dust, and a state of frustration can be generally seen. As soon as Shi Da saw Liu Rushi, he quickly put down his teacup, jumped up, bowed to her, and said, "Madame Liu, how have you been since we last met? Do you still recognize the Iron Beggar from back then?" Liu Rushi smiled slightly and said, "How could I not recognize the brave man? It's been many years since we last met, and I often remember you. I don't know where the brave man has been all this time? Where did you come from? Please sit down and tell me." Shi Da thanked her and sat sideways on the kang. Liu Rushi sat on a brocade stool next to him. Shi Da sighed again and said, "I am grateful for the kindness and care of Madame Liu and Huang Gong in the past. The friendship of wearing clothes together will never be forgotten. After receiving a letter from the young master of the Jinling Marquis, I went to serve under Ning Nanhou, and I also wore armor and held a spear to kill bandits. Later, because Ning Nanhou was tyrannical and arrogant, and his wild nature was difficult to tame, I left him and went to another place. I once followed General Huang Degong to resist the barbarians. Unfortunately, Degong died in battle, so I wandered in Jiangnan and became an Iron Beggar again. Some old comrades invited me to join the Qing army to make contributions, but I vowed not to serve foreigners and harm my compatriots, so I would rather starve to death than go there. Later, I drifted to the Zhoushan Islands, and suddenly met..." (30)</p>
<h3>Maxims for Self-Cultivation (Six)</h3>
<p>When there are many things to do, one complains of being too busy; when there are few things to do, one complains of being too idle. Being busy is not good, and being idle is not good, so how is it good? I tell you, when things are busy, you must know how to arrange them. If you arrange them properly, you won't be chaotic even when you're busy; when there are few things to do, you must know how to find things to do. If you can find things to do, you will never be idle!</p>
<h3>"Confucius" to be Rerun at Golden Capital Later Tonight</h3>
<p>The box office success of Min Hua's "Confucius" at Golden City can be said to have exceeded people's expectations, but because Golden City had an agreement with Golden Star in advance, it finally gave up this New Year's Eve to "Red Powdered Faces and Golden Spears" on the evening of the 31st of last year. However, the owner of Golden City promised that after "Romance of the Western Chamber" had finished its run at the newly opened Golden Capital, "Confucius" would continue to be rerun in this new theater. This news has been recorded in the newspaper. Now it is known that it has been decided to rerun it on the evening of the 11th. Audiences who have not seen "Confucius" last time, do not miss this last opportunity, because Min Hua once stated that "Confucius" will no longer be shown in second-run theaters.</p>
