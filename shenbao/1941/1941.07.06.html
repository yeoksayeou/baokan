<h3>美利堅獨立紀念日　羅斯福向全國廣播　辛苦得來之解放已臨災　促人民準備犧牲維護自由</h3>
<p>合衆社五日海德公園電　羅斯福總統昨日警吿美國人民、謂「美國決不能在獨裁之沙漠中、單」獨長此爲快樂及興盛之自由草原」、並喚起人民抵抗足以分散彼等士氣及團結之企圖、爲保護此「自由草原」及獲得海洋自由之保設、美國現正從事於「一嚴重、偉大及團結之工作」、惟稱、僅藉團結、不能生效、美國現正需要「迅捷及有效之苦工」、總統此言、係於美國獨立紀念日向全國廣播者、渠言、「吾人於向吾人之國家及吾人之國旗重宣偉大之誓詞時、吾人應深切相信吾人於宜誓之餘、並須貢獻吾人之工作、吾人之意志、必要時、且須貢獻吾人之生命」、羅斯福稱、處於目前之危機中、美國人實有與一七七六年間對常時美國人之同樣職責、吾人於一七七六年因信仰「政府應自被統治者之允許　　　　　自由」之偉大主義而作戰、此後在一世紀又半之時期中、此種人類自由主義風行全球、然至我人之世、允其在最近數年、此主義竟遭由新的暴君政體而起之新抵抗所反對矣、一七七六年之基本精神、正在海外遭受打擊、並正在此間發動威脅、任何美國人如認爲暴力統治能在他處戰勝人類自由、但能任令自由單獨在美國維持不墜、則實爲不經之談、此種見解乃係幼稚之幻想、此種不適當之信念、實爲各國招致傾覆之來由、美國人如搖動國旗、重申對自由之信念、而即止於此、則頭腦委實太過簡單、但吾人於淸夜醒覺、而對世事作斷之研究者、當知吾人今日已不能徒藉鑲刀及火槍以保護自由、吾人並知左右之鄰人盡失自由之時、吾人決不能在一己之境內保護自由、此乃吾人現時所以從事於一嚴重、偉大團結工作之故、以保衛此牛球及海洋之自由也、吾人不獨需要團結、並需要速率、及有效之工作、並將對深入吾國境內、炸燬吾國軍火廠之間諜活動予以制止、</p>
<p>國際社五日海德公園電　羅斯福總統於昨日獨立紀念日、向全國廣播演說、全文不過四四七字、然滿布辛辣詞句、使國人深切明瞭、一七七六年辛苦得來之自由解放、今已面臨災厄、</p>
<h3>獨立紀念儀式隆重　美國人民宣誓効忠</h3>
<p>路透社五日紐的電　美國在國外多事與國內積極整軍之時、昨以空前之隆重儀式紀念獨立節、當羅斯福總統宣布美國人民於必要時必須犧牲生命維護自由後、國人皆對國旗矢忠、總統從海德公國發言、音節至爲莊嚴、總統發言後、司法部長史通繼之發言、引導全國聽衆對國旗宣誓効忠、民事國防局事前布置、使各處美人臨時停止工作、以便參加慶祝儀式、故屆時汽車駕駛員在途停車、兵士在營立正、莫不靜聆無錢電播音、並相率於史通引導下、向美國國旗及其所代表之共和國宣誓効忠、有數處適値陰雨、未能燃放燄火、然他處則興高采烈、爭放燄火、蓋依據國防程序、燄火須經世界恢復和平時始再製造、故此次燃放燄火、乃許多年來之最每一次也、美國人聞英國境內亦熱烈慶祝美國獨立節之消息、甚為感奮、是日美國各處仍如往年有汽車肇禍等事、在最初數小時內、因此殞生者聞已達二十二人、</p>
<p>合衆社五日華盛頓電　美國大理院正卿賈克遜、昨敦促美國人重行堅定對民治政體之信念、以戰勝獨裁國家之「惡毒的征服他人政策」、賈克遜發表國慶日演說云、「獨立宣言」以希望賜予全世界被奴役之人民、又稱、被人征服這國家從民族權利中獲得反抗之靈感、以改變或消滅現行足以毀滅生命、自由及幸福之政府、</p>
<h3>美信仰與納粹主義　二者不能並存於世</h3>
<p>路透社五日馬尼刺電　美國駐菲大員賽爾、昨慶祝七四節時、發表演說、謂一九四一年局勢之嚴重、非一七七六年可比、因昔日僅爲少數殖民地自由之問題、而今日則爲全人類權利之問題也、吾人固可閉其耳目、不問他國事、但吾人終不能逃其影響、未有一國能破壞國際公法之有秩序的手續、而不危害他國人民者、如日本之與中國東三省及義國之與阿比西尼亞即其證也、納粹哲學之產生、在證明赤裸裸的武力治權之正當、故納粹法規乃强暴者、不顧人類、祇國權力之法規、世界雖大、不能使納粹主義與美國信仰並存於世、二者必去其一、吾人祈禱上蒼、此非爲美國作戰之謂、但若果謂作戰、則吾人籲請上蒼助我、蓋吾人舍此無可爲也、英國現以背抵墻爲吾人賴以生活者而戰、苟無美國援助、則必遭失敗、而英國之失敗、將使美洲獨與歐亞兩洲爲敵矣</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>論紅軍戰略</h3>
<p>德蘇開戰兩星期後，德軍在一千五百英里的冗長戰綫上，已獲有若干局部進展，這是不必諱言的。北自波羅的海沿岸起，南迄特尼斯德河流域止，德軍幾乎是傾全力進撲，但紅軍抵抗之堅强，却也並不使人十分失望，截至目下爲止，納粹軍雖在償付重大代價之後，取得若干據點，但匪特未能盡所謂「閃電戰」的能事，實際上對於整個戰局，也還說不上引起什麼決定作用；因爲在蘇聯當局已宣佈決定長期抗戰的今日，世人對於德軍的孤軍深入，母髯倒要替它「揑一把汗」，蘇聯非法國可比，這是每一個評論家都已見到的，戰綫旣拉得這麼長，史達林所宣佈的焦土戰和游擊戰，又是俄羅斯人的「傳統傑作」，除非眞能在八星期內，把整個蘇聯擊碎得像波蘭或法蘭西一樣，吾則，凡稍具常識的人，都不免替德國「担憂」—担憂它終將蹈往昔拿翁的覆轍。</p>
<p>檢討兩週來德軍的戰果，其中比較値得重視的，的分三路：（一）波羅的海方面，已攻佔立陶宛全部和拉特維亞的一半，今後勢將進窺愛沙尼亞，俾和自芬蘭加萊里亞地峽南下的德軍，會攻列髯格勒；（二）在白俄羅斯邦方面，德軍已越過明斯克，據柏林宣傳，甚至已渡過貝萊齊那河，直叩斯摩倫斯克，這一路是德方最深入的一枝軍隊，也是最主要的一路攻勢，其目的在直搗莫斯科；（三）西烏克蘭方面，德軍於攻佔林堡，勒克，杜勃諾諸地之後，此際正向什多米爾進攻，目的在窺取烏克蘭首府基輔，以便他日可和自羅馬尼亞進攻敖德薩的一路軍事相呼應。</p>
<p>就上觀之，可知目下最應注意的，殆爲貝萊齊那河一綫的中路戰事；假定斯摩倫斯克有失，莫斯科當然即將直接感到威脅，屆時蘇聯當局爲穩定中樞繼續抗戰計，說不定便要把國都遷往內地去，關於此層，一說當遷至烏拉爾山地的斯凡地佛斯多克，一說甚或遷往西比利亞額爾齊斯河流域的鄂木斯克，無論如何，根據中國作戰的經騐和成績，祇要蘇聯民族團結一致，同仇敵愾，國都儘管內遷，戰區儘管擴大，這在整個抗戰程序中，匪特無損於最後勝利的獲得，且爲對付利於速戰速法的敵人時，一種最有效的賢明戰略。</p>
<p>蘇聯的領袖史達林，顯已澈底明瞭這種戰略的重要性，所以他在本月三日向全國所發的廣播演說中，已以最明快的調子，最堅決的語氣，向全國宣佈這一戰略的採用。他首先承認德軍已獲短期的優勢地位，他說：「蘇聯領土一部份的陷落，乃由於戰爭開始時情形利於德軍而不利於蘇聯所致」，因爲一方是交戰國，早已厚集兵力，毀的進攻，一方則倉卒應戰，尚待動員，所以免不了要先吃一些虧；不過，他認定這是無關大體的，他勗勉全國人民集中力量，爲自由而戰，爲祖國而戰，他確信「最後勝利必屬於蘇聯」，這和中國民族的自信抗建必勝，正好遙相輝映。不髯唯是，史丹林並訓告人民實施焦土政策，他說：「紅軍苟在不得已而撒退時，所有車輛必須全部撒退，即一輛火車，一磅五穀或一加侖汽油，也不得留供敵人利用，農塲之牲口與糧食，應交當局運往後方，凡不能移去之物，則當加以毀滅。」這種堅壁淸野的辦法，用以對付孤軍深入，志在掠奪資源的敵人，正是最有效的制勝途徑。假使紅軍當局今後果能善用這一戰略，鍥而不合，俾在廣大的蘇聯領土，展開堪和中國媲美的又一長期消耗戰，以絆住希特勒的機械部隊，則深信一入冬季，這些所謂「奔閃一師團，都要一一陷入「雪堆」之中，而致無法動彈了。</p>
<h3>日設「安全區」目的　實欲封鎖對蘇航運　美認與維持公海自由政策牴觸　且將引起美日兩國間緊急狀態　英則信日將南進或竟佔領越南</h3>
<p>合衆社五日華盛頓電　自東京宜布日本刻正考慮在西北太平洋上建設「安全區」、此間外交界昨日評論此事、認爲日本實欲建立一實際上之封鎖、不准商輪運載給養由海參崴至蘇聯、此種實際上封鎖、勢將直接與美國維持公海自由政策互相牴觸、且將使美、日兩國發生嚴重之緊張狀態、據此間消息靈通界稱、日人爲安全區之設立、與在西半球附近之安全區域相同之說、實屬不確、蓋日本之安全區、意在制止一切商輪運送接濟至蘇聯、而美國之安全區則意在便利正常之商航也、美國安全區域並不制止任何商輪、美國之巡邏亦不阻止交戰國軍艦之自山行駛、惟在阻止交戰國軍艦在區域內發生「戰鬥行爲」耳、故安全區之意義、在使軍艦不作戰爭之行動、並使之不阻礙商航在區內進行、權威界人士以爲、日人如思引美國安全區爲前例、以達共在日本附近海面　限制貨輪之目的、彼等將再度　曲解美國之主義、官方回顧日人前亦曾曲解美國之主義、以企圖在東亞取得霸權之野心與美國之門羅政策相提並論、當時美國官方迭决指出、門羅主義意在阻止外人進一步在西半球實行殖民政策之企圖、並制止外人在新地球作政治活動、官方又稱、進一步言之、美國之「安全區域」係由廿一獨立之共和國所公認、並非爲日本憑一己之意向遽在西半洋作此建議也、</p>
<p>國際社五日華盛頓電　若干美外交觀察家於研究遠東情况後、對美、日接近之機會、咸表悲觀、國務副卿滅爾斯、雖希望日本之突然改變其對外政策、或可保持太平洋之和平、但此間官方咸恐日本之作戰機構、終將移至蘇聯西伯利亞沿海諸省、因日本賡繼與荷印進行商務談判、故若干觀察家信、日暫時並未有南進之象、但若干人信、日本之領土擴張新運動、正在醞釀中、此間有資格觀察以爲、日此項行動、即爲進攻西伯利亞、據指稱、設此舉得手、則日可除去北方之軍事威脅、而使其接近新資源云、</p>
<p>合衆社五日倫敦電　官方及非官方人士昨日漸信、日本即將放棄共公布之不捲入戰爭漩渦政策、重行採取南進政策、並認日人在可能之行動中、或竟將佔領法屬越南、衆信日本或企圖在加姆能灣取得海軍根據地、因在世界此一方面該地實爲圾佳之天然港日也、衆叉信日本並將仲張共空軍至印度支那之南、</p>

<h3>投機蠢動　金價暴騰　衝出六千六百元大關</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、漲風重熾、價已飛出六千六百元大關外、各方人心奇堅、乃旣承前晚收市前後之漲勢、更謠下週銀行將停做期貨外匯交易、故在投機家袖進百萬美元扒風中趨緊、塲內各證券號與匯稟商傾進、散多拚命提抬、致當日價由六千五百五十二元、哄達六千六百三十二元、終猛漲九十三元、半日交易六七萬兩、下午週六無市、價雖續升至六千六百四十五元、俱有供無求、現金福康永售予晋元二十兩、老慶雲五十兩、均照期交價高二百八十元、後又出天元於十兩、高二百六十元、計軋升七十餘元、飾金漲十元、達七百十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>期貨又抬起近百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點十五分開市、即在散戶買風中高三十三元、爲六千五百七十元、天元力進至六千五百八十元、俄見成記·德大·公大·大豐·祥興永·天元·恒記等相率售出、且聞美匯五元二八一二五、中外商行均有供意、更傳美國增發每張二十五元之新鈔、及平準會維持黑市美匯五元二五說、止漲故稍盤下、至六千五百五十二元、直至十點半後、祥和•明豐·熾大·德孚來收吸、遂步見回上、及聞謠傳轉利買方、外匯突又趨緊、天元·新豐永·益大等亦來猛進、浮多趁機又抬、價遂突飛猛晋、躍出六千六百元外、售者更束手不前、續升至六千六百三十二元、一利獨售、散多脫手至六千六百二十七元、正午收市六千六百三十元、比前日晚收價漲九十三元、照七月美金五元二一八七五結價、爲六千六百七十三元、計撳四十三元、收後升至六千六百三十八元、後退至六千六百二十元、最後六千六百三十元、上半日（塲外不計）有八十元差度、下午塲外價升至六千六百四十五元、最後有賣戶、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤價高二百六十元、收進比售出低八十元、現標金無市、</p>
<p>飾金高懸七百十元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均於上午十一點半升十元、爲七百十元、收進减叫十元云、</p>
<p>美鈔出十九元關</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價猛漲、英美金鎊跟漲二元、英金票杲定如故、市價站平、美金票開盤八角半、開後承豐•永和·順源·增餘等售出、退爲八角、嗣聞滙市劇緊、五元二五之關已破、同豐·聯合•志成·大公等力購、近午高至十九元零四分、午收十九元零三分、比上日軋漲二角八分、現貨减低二角半左右、香港票趨勢尚穩、市價站平、日金票漲起二分、晚市爲一元九角四分、朝鮮票穩定、市價站平、晚市仍站一元五角七分原盤、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債市氣尙優</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况曾經一度再小三角後、復又回上、丙種又穿出二元、此種行市、倐升倐降、可見出籠者自出籠、買進者自買進、觀各戶之進出、顯然多方已在轉換形勢、似在由整化零、不過永昌及怡泰及信孚等家是吾持票收利、尚是問題耳、昨爲週六、祇做一盤、於十一時開做、永昌信孚怡泰仍在繼續收買、同與裕興益昌等均有買進、鴻大鼎康協大德隆多頭粉出籠、仁豐仁昌大華均有出脫、丙種小至一兀四角半、復又穿出一元、結果居然多方佔優勢、一致上漲五角至三角、成交總數、共計的一百二三十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、股</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中興煤礦公司股五十股、價爲一百四十六元一角、</p>
<h3>糧食　米蠢偏說來源不繼　無如洋米越到越多　一日間到五船計有十六萬餘包　即使南進實現難道米價一定貴</h3>
<p>米蠹方在揚言來源不繼、棧存漸薄、又思乘機抬價操縱、妨礙民食、所幸有洋米大量到滬、法公公司霞飛將軍號郵船昨晨到埠、由西貢裝來洋米三萬九千包、停虹順泰碼頭起卸、華綸洋行格蘭輪、由仰光運來工部局公倉米二萬七千一百五十包、昨晨到滬、前預定停靠浦東鴻升碼頭、昨晨進口時、公司命改靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、叉華綸洋行經理之法輪凡利尼（S.S.G.G.A.Varenne）號、由西貢裝來洋米三萬四千包、亦於昨晨抵埠、停靠浦東隆茂碼頭起卸、又有懸掛泰國旗之S.S.SnrlyothaiNawa號、由仰光裝來洋米四萬七千包、昨午到埠、停靠虹口公和祥碼頭起卸該泰輪進口由英商賚賜洋行經理、太古公司廣東輪、亦於晨到滬、由香港裝來洋米一萬五千包、停靠法租界外灘碼頭起卸、該是否工部局之平價米、因未註明、故未能證明、計昨日五輸、共運來洋米十六萬二千一百五十包之鉅、事實勝於雄辯、但米囤虎叉將以日本南占越南、爲其抬價口實、然以大勢觀察、無論時局如何變化、當不至盡如米虎之期望、而使米糧貴至餓殺大衆之地步、（祖）</p>
<p>邇日洋米市况、久呈盤旋不定之狀態、昨日仍先漲後跌之徘徊景象、惟投機客囤辦胃甚貪、滬西內地各幫尤爲活躍、雖實銷本客並無暢胃、而市價終被在抬價放價下逐步踢高、不獨漲過前日收價、且又超出前日早市最高價、一度喊起二三之多、繼因新到貨源源不絕、有餘額之散戶及獲利浮多莫不趁高求脫、市乃昂而復落、結果仍比前晚較大一元左右、二號邏暹英華司至一百四十四元半、小絞現期均自一百五十元至一百五十一元、最高會至一百五十一元半、碎米祇開中貨一百十三元、成交一千多噸、現米不下二萬包、惟大半由囤戶收進、實銷不足十分之三、蓋客幫以價昂運難需要不旺、而本街則被公賣所安定、而囤戶則惑於國際變化匯幣謠言、頗有心思作用之吸收也、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、昨則兩者情形不同、市况遂亦迴異，其若南港鮮早晚稻、仍以貨稀胃馨、愈見俏色、售價續升二三元、開出高自百四十二元、决至百四十元零五角、無錫原包宿粳則以時令關係、氣質已變、乏人垂靑、故市色平席、開百三十二元、次至百二十七八元、</p>
<p>糯米無論國洋兩貨、復以去路轉遜、雖市貨有限、貨主猶圖扳持、而卒難收效、僅能相隨洋米呈堅定之局面、價與前相仿、計售香港高白元、仍爲百二十三四元、中關百二十元、糯菉特別百十四元、普通百十二元、决至百零八元、金丹國糯高自百二十三四元、决至百二十元左右、</p>
<h3>客銷活動　粉市重趨高翔</h3>
<p>昨日現洋粉市况、緣本埠利多消息頻傳、及金融米市逐見抬高聲中、本客實銷均轉活躍、客囤收買亦勁、金龍粉開盤三十二元八角半、旋即步昂至三十三元二角五分、砲台粉亦升至三十四元、及五燕牌美粉三十三元四角、比前回漲四五角、其他各種雜牌、直接配客者亦屬不少、各貨均昂三四角、統市成交共有兩萬餘包、實銷的佔半數、其餘均爲投機心思交易、小麥供求兩寂、日廠方面、偶有門市收進、額僅三五十包之數、價仍爲四十元左右、雜糧市塲，七七紀念停市一天、八日照常開業、</p>
<h3>雜糧　油豆餅動而不暢</h3>
<p>昨日油豆餅實銷均屬動而不暢、囤戶亦屬觀望態度居多、故交易零多躉少、市呈平軟之象、統市售開大連豆油三十桶、大有廠豆油一百担、天津金元三百包、膠州黃豆一百餘包、歸德黃豆一百包、靑口黃豆三百包、大有豆餅三千片、祿字豆餅一千四百片、甡記豆餅二千片、又七月上交一萬五千片、價均略疲、（行情詳市價欄）昨由烟台運來豆油一百件、又有牛油一百四十聽、自天津運來、</p>
<h3>紗花多空具戒心　現紗起伏轉狹　粵紗起伏轉狹　粵銷亦覺不振</h3>
<p>紗市由盤旋而昂、但實際交易稍形消淡、卅二支單紗因貨缺、粵幫需要鼎盛、市價日升、所以人心良好、不過二十支雙馬廠單、因賣買艱難、且額子縮短、起伏較狹也、至於倒閉之紗號、仍無相當的辦法、故雙方咸具戒心、多抱觀望主義、等待元氣恢復、再行重振旗鼓而來、市面乃轉旺盛矣、二十支雙馬高價爲一千六百十六元、低價爲一千五百九十五元、午後因週末、鴉雀無聲矣、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開人心挺秀、大家都喊買進、首盤價爲一千六百零二兀、直升至一千六百十五元、旋以粵幫二十支紗交易不爽、且檯面新買者不湧、情况轉鬆、一千五百九十五元、豈料標金大漲、人心重見振作、最後收盤價爲一千六百十五元、查半日間成交統計四千一百四十五包、內香港幫進一百四十五包、同行皮球生意四千包、</p>
<p>金變馬標紗市况、開盤平不、繼聞現紗交易不根轉落、迨至收盤、聞金價趨升曰隨之高昂、結果七月平、八月小一兀、九月平、查半日成交統計一萬二千五百六十包、比前日减一萬一千四百四十包、茲將其半日間高低收盤價列左、</p>
<h3>粗絨突吿起色</h3>
<p>現棉情况、依然堅挺、但交易雖見减色、然人心總抱樂觀也、良以細絨原料稀貴異常、難以掉動、故咸注重於印度粗絨及火機本棉之類、日商洋行亦對內地火機大量傾吸、粗絨之健有所來也、</p>
<p>紐的棉市、昨日休業、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因加爾加答賣出、及多頭獲利了結而跌、繼之又因歐洲出口商買進轉平、最後市况再因多頭了結、及氣候報告利於空頭而跌、昨日收盤價格、各跌四至七羅比不等、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交、市况靜而堅、因訂購手續頻繁、及來源不暢、而成交略稀、昨日除外商廠方有五百件巴西棉成交外、花號家僅進印棉及阿根廷棉四百餘包也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　烚赤猛升　棉布午後重振</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市先跌繼升、晨以浮囤出籠、客幫本街進意淡薄、形勢虛軟、各布售盤均告下挫、白貨粗細布斜紋跌二角五分、漂染布一部份價跌三五角、惟午刻因烚赤猛升、引起囤戶購意、貨主扳價、又告回升、結果與上日殊少上落、本街午後成交較旺、的計三百餘件、粵港幫辦華豐等廠藍布•色斜·卡其布等貨二百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　始疲終漲、蓋細布期貨收盤七月期跌四角、十月漲七分、現貨市塲、因週六交易淸淡、龍頭細布棧單收盤亦跌一角、爲四十八元八角、嗶嘰升二厘半、爲一元六角二分二五、但收盤後忽以標金在升、利多空氣甚濃、塲外龍頭細布有做開至四十九元六角、飛魚細布四十九元、亦有成交、</p>
<p>出口　今日有疋頭一百件、運往烟臺、又三十件、運往天津、</p>
<h3>呢絨貴則貴矣—羅致依然不乏—</h3>
<p>（春貨）因新秋時日、亦能應市、故大半仍有交易、行情堅挺者多、疲弱者少、</p>
<p>（夏貨）走銷甚佳、然實銷期已過大半、故交易零多而整少、派力斯法蘭絨凡而頂羽紗呢蠟綫光蔴膠布類、出路暢旺特甚、售價則因爲時已晚、悉多平穩、</p>
<p>（秋貨）近日走銷最旺、大批發戶逐日進出忙碌、本廠貨成交、遠較舶來品爲殷、馬褲呢駝斯錦、黃華特呢黃嗶嘰、交易特夥、四十元上下西裝花呢、趨勢最爲鋒俏、</p>
<p>（冬貨）趨勢較之其他呢絨特俏、售價在漲驚人、究其主耍原因、因視近來歐戰局面、運到必難、來源必缺、以致大半多居奇、視同拱璧、然貴固貴矣、然而羅致者仍不乏人、斯亦奇矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新金針菜　號盤售開</h3>
<p>金針菜新貨各產地已先後收割、聞本年出數尚稱不惡、亦將决第運滬、昨到有靑江貨少數號盤隨即開出、其價爲二百五十元、貨身平平而已、</p>
<h3>海南圓肉暴漲</h3>
<p>海南圓肉因號貨已近開通、故行方拉抬更力、簍莊冷氣貨現已開升三十五元、成交十件、同時行盤亦叫升五萬元、大片元肉近銷雖稀、號盤亦跟升廿餘元、頗有直上靑雲之槪、</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖平穏</h3>
<p>昨糖市無甚上落、公會劃盤、二十四號粗砂白現貨四月份到貨九十一元七角至八角、五月份到貨九十二兀五角五分、六月份到貨九十二兀七角、最近上月二十六日到貨九十三兀七角至九十五元•六元、太古車白B嘜一百零九元、HX嘜九十一元五角、均言明好出打單、荷赤KD嘜七十四元二角、TMLNT嘜七十二元、又太古車糖、昨由香港運抵四千一百包、</p>
<h3>海味　新海蜇出產豐富</h3>
<p>海蜇新貨業已登塲、最近運到一批、查木年出產頗豐、當售開新蜇皮爲一百四十元、陳貨須一百六十五元、新蜇頭一百十元、陳貨一百二十五元、際此炎夏、冷食最宜、故銷路至活潑</p>
<h3>螟晡獻新</h3>
<p>新螟蜅首批貨已運到少數、出水至佳、計售開寗波輔爲二百五十元、陳貨二百元、舟山新蜅三百九十五元、較之前市須挺進十五碼之度、</p>
<h3>一號椒絕為俏俐</h3>
<p>胡椒近市轉定、如白椒及黑大椒無甚變動、均持前價、惟一號椒趨勢極爲俏俐、故號盤昨市開至一百五十元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　烟悄平定</h3>
<p>烟煤屑各貨、又入沉寂之途，客銷依然呆滯、本街除少數零星點綴、迄無大額去化、故市况平平、無甚上落、昨做印度烟屑每噸三百六十元、開平屑三百四十八元、二號屑三百二十元、以上均同業行拆、棧房出貨、送到客戶、酌加行槓、</p>
<h3>台灣焦炭　抵隙而入</h3>
<p>焦炭一貨、高低不一、市上如開平焦、中興焦等上檔貨、價均在千元以上、殊駭人聽聞、目來貨不多、尚乏躉批、日前聞虹口某碼頭在草包台灣焦炭裝到、的有三百餘噸、塊子碎小、質地較劣、故開價尚廉、塊炭每噸四百元自車、問津者不乏其人、</p>

<h3>民族解放戰爭　必須全民服役　大陸報籲請奉行兵役法　以蔣委員長人格為模範</h3>
<p>最近軍事委員會發起士紳公務人員子弟當兵運動、二日由蔣委員長發出代電、飭令各地遵辦、本市英文大陸報昨日曾著文加以評論、大意謂、納　代役、在美國南北戰爭時代、曾有此現象、當時資產階級、均不願奉行兵役、而放棄其應盡之國民義務、</p>
<p>資產階級一體奉行</p>
<p>今中國兵役法規定、凡達入伍年齡者、必須爲祖國效勞、然就事實證明、此項法規、尚未能得資產階級之奉行、此實係中國社會制度之弱點、中國爲自由而進行民族解放戰爭、自不應專恃中國勞苦大衆流血與汗、</p>
<p>封建觀念不應存在</p>
<p>今彼等在此一偉大鬥爭中、旣較其他階級効勞最多、如中國作戰、將來僅恃彼等、則彼等之崇高意識、必將因資產階級子弟可以免役而深感不快、中國社會封建觀念、根深蒂固、因此若干貴族子弟可以免服兵役、非彼等自願如此、彼爲家屬阻止彼等盡國民天職也、</p>
<p>迫切需要犧甡精神</p>
<p>彼等父母雖不願其子弟爲國犧牲、但除非彼等父母不知亡國之苦痛、吾則必能了解此種爲國犧牲之重要、中國需要全民族具有犧牲精神、旣較任何國家爲迫切、中國需要每一人民能如蔣委員長有崇高之意志與人格、以解決國家之各種困難、中國必需使兵役法能到處奉行、無貧富階級之分、則中國必能永成一偉大民族、爲保障全人類之福祉而奮鬥、</p>

<p>小朋友們！你們聽見過「龜兎賽跑」的故事嗎？簡單的故事是這樣的：有一天，烏龜和兎子賽跑。烏龜雖然走路遲緩，但它一步一步地用力爬，始終不懈。兎子起初跑得很快，但在中途睡了一脗結果却落在烏龜之後。</p>
<p>我們求學，正好像賽跑，一刻不能停止。如果一有問斷，不但學業沒有進境，反因遺忘而退步。古人說得好「求學如逆水行舟，不進則退。』眞是至理名言。</p>
<p>現在暑假已經開始了，小朋友們從嚴肅的學校生活裏解放出來，一定覺得非常快活的吧？但是，求學是不能間斷的，暑假中天氣十分炎熱，不宜多用腦力，自然也不可白白讓它空過了去。每天的早晨，氣候比較凉爽些，正是用功學習的時候，除了溫習功課之外，看些有價値的書本和報紙，可以增進各種知識。還有寫字和日記，也是不可一日或間的。學校裹規定的假期作業，要逐日去做。如果嫌得一個人工作太寂寞，那末邀集幾個同志，組織起「暑期讀書會」來，互相切磋，互相督促，所得的益處，自然史多哩！</p>
<p>小朋友們！希望你們在這暑假裏，勿爲炎暑威脅，勿為娛樂引誘，仍能努力求學，勿稍間斷，繼續上進！</p>
<h3>人生是路</h3>
<p>— 新膏</p>
<p>是一個初夏的午後，瓊恩與維翰吃罷了飯沒事做，就計劃去附近的森林裹進玩。這是非常大的一座森林，高高的樹，紅紅的花，綠綠的草，還有小鳥兒飛來飛去唱着快樂的歌；美麗的景緻就把這兩位小朋友迷住了。直到天上已經發現了星星，他們方感到時候不早了，該是回家的時候啦。可是，他們早把進來的路傑忘記了。</p>
<p>「讓我們趕快跑吧，媽在家裹等得一定心焦了！」維翰對瓊恩如此地說，</p>
<p>『可是路呢？這來大的地方，這來多的小路，我們該走那一條路出去呢？』瓊恩茫然了。</p>
<p>他們只有暗暗摸索着，各條小路，都去試騐一下，可是都失敗了，走來走去，他們還是在森林裏。有一條，他們滿心以爲這是可以引他們出去的，豈知雖然走出了森林，前面橫着一個大湖沼，阻擋了他們。</p>
<p>後來，直至媽跑來把他們帶了出去，「孩子們，我等你們好久了！」媽對他們說道：「所謂人生也是如此。你們無論走到那裹，都應該隨帶一本指南。那末就不致迷路了。世界上往往有許多似乎是很寬暢的大路，它們會給你各秤各樣迷人的快樂，其實都是墮落的死路。」</p>
<p>小朋友們，什麼是人生的指南？還不是多讀書，多學習？</p>
<h3>第一名</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>爲鄰里所讚許。爲父母所歡喜，但切不可自滿。</p>
<p>當學校舉行暑假休業業式時，小朋友們所急欲知道而等待期望的，是總平均的學分若干？榜上列在第幾名？因爲這是平時勤學與吾的寒暑表，成績優劣的總測騐。</p>
<p>我的决兒希賢，肄業在私立自强小學有年，現在是五年級甲，下學期將升入六年級。平時自恃天資聰慧，不大肯刻苦讀書。我深慮他小小年紀，（今年十二歲，滬戰時曾失學一年。）太自作聰敏，（他的天資，的確聰敏異常兒。）所以我倆常恩威並濟的監緊他，學以致且，母懈母怠。他能聽話，專心致志，故在校每屆考試成續，輒名列第二或第三，從無落後。本屆，他叉考得「五甲」「第一名，」領到了自强校長沈爾柯先生的一紙「獎學券。」券上註明：（一）此券祗漿各級學業成績前三名。（二）持此券可入本校本屆暑期學校肄業，免收學費及書籍費。（三）此券不可頂替使用。（四）如本人不入暑期學校，肄業，不可作其他使用云云。我倆決計命他入暑期補習，以求深造。他一時爲鄰里所讚許，爲我倆所歡喜，但是我倆做父母的，切戒他自滿。要格外的向上，格外的自勉和努力學業。希望考得「第一名」小朋友們也切勿「自滿」</p>
<h3>世界第一次滅蚊運動</h3>
<p>— 張兆林</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，你們世界地理大槪都知道的，在亞美利加洲，有條巴拿馬運河，溝通大西洋至太平洋，可說是現在世界上最大的一條運河了</p>
<p>這條運河，最初本是一位法國人李賽浦經營的，因爲巴拿馬地方，有一種黃熱病非常厲害，每年要害死好幾萬工人，大家都怕死不願意去工作，弄到李賽浦沒有辦法，只得把開運河的工作停止了。</p>
<p>後來有一位美國駐古巴的醫生，叫做哥嚘斯大佐他研究黃熱病的來源，知道是由於中美洲一帶所產生的蚊子傳播的。蚊子吸了患黃熱病人的血，病菌跟着所吸的血，混到蚊子的嘴裏，它再去可沒有病的人，就把病菌混人那人的血中，於是黃熱病便傳染給那個人了　在一九〇四年哥嘎斯大佐到運河區域一帶，去分佈很多的術生工作人員，從巴拿馬運河到科倫實行撲滅兩大區域內蚊子的工作，淸理陰溝，塡平小水窟池沼，裏面都噴澆了煤油，食用的水，用罩蓋好，巳經患了黃熱病的人，都須完全隔離醫治，不使蚊子再吸到病菌，蚊子比較多的地方，燃燒硫磺把它們薰死……等等的功作，這樣剛巧一年，到了一九〇五年十二月便把蚊子肅淸。</p>
<p>這决總共耗去了除蟲藥二十萬磅，硫磺四十萬磅，眞可算得世界上第一次最大規模的滅蚊運動了！</p>
<p>蚊子肅淸以後，黃熱病也不再發生了，於是美國人便開始鑿通巴拿馬運河。</p>
<h3>靑蛙的舌頭</h3>
<p>— 冠羣</p>
<p>慧兒放學回來，在田岸上看見一隻靑蛙，正吐出它的舌頭在那裏捕捉小蟲，他就蹲下去，把靑蛙捉了起來，兜在衣襟裹。</p>
<p>慧兒回到家裹，就把靑蛙抓出來，仔仔細細地對它看，看了一會，又把它的嘴扳開，要想看它的舌頭，那知道它的舌頭忽然沒有了，</p>
<p>慧兒覺得很奇怪，就問他的姊姊道：「靑蛙的舌頭到底到那裹去了呢？」姊姊說：「據我想，恐怕靑蛙沒有舌頭的。」慧兒忙道：「我沒有捉住它的時候，明明看見它吐出了舌頭，捕捉小蟲，怎麼說它沒有舌頭呢？」姊姊說：「那麼，我不知道了，你去問爸爸吧。</p>
<p>慧兒連忙跑去問爸爸。爸爸說：「你怎麼想起這句話來問我呢？「慧兒說：「我在沒有捉住它的時候，看見它吐出舌頭，捕捉小蟲，現在我扳開它的嘴，要想看看它的舌頭，舌頭忽然沒有了，這不是一件很奇怪的事嗎？後來就問姊姊，姊姊說不曉得，所以我來問你！」爸爸說：「你道小孩千眞細心極了，我很歡喜你！你要明白靑蛙的舌頭的搆造嗎？等一下！我去我一本關於靑蛙的書來給你看」慧兒聽得爸爸贊美他，很是快樂；因此他要研究靑蛙舌頭的興趣，越發濃厚了</p>
<p>一會兒，爸爸拿了一本書來，指着靑蛙一段對慧兒說：「因爲它的舌根，連在下顎上，舌尖向內，所以你把它嘴扳開的時候，看不出舌頭了，」慧兒說：「爸爸！你說的話不對，你說它的舌尖向內，那麼，它的舌尖怎麼能够伸出在嘴的外面呢？」爸爸笑道：「唯其它的舌尖向內，所以能够倒向外面伸出來。」慧兒道：「那麼，飛着的小蟲，它怎麼能够捉得牢呢？」爸爸道：「因爲它的舌頭上有一層黏液，蚊子或飛蛾飛過來，只要用舌頭一捲就把它們黏住了，於是呑下肚去。」慧兒領悟地道：「哦！原來如此。」</p>

<h3>瑙瑪希拉恨孤獨生活</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>提起瑙瑪希拉，誰都知道她是前米高梅經理歐文泰爾堡的寡妻，他們在一九二八年締結良緣，生有一子一女。可是好景不常，不到幾年，泰爾堡竟棄其如花美眷而長逝，於是這位絕代藝人遂墮入黑暗的深淵。這突襲的創痛，死別的悲哀，迫使她暫時脫離了銀幕生活，直到一九三八年才重返銀壇，蘇醒她黑灰色的夢。最近，她碰到了喬治賴甫德，於是那熄滅的愛火，又重新燃燒起來。她眞的要再醮嗎？的確，這裹有她的自白爲證：</p>
<p>一最使我驚奇的，是一般人似乎很關心我，現在我有着一個機會一吐我心中蘊藏着的一切悲哀了。」瑙瑪說。</p>
<p>「我第一該宣佈，我以爲孤獨生活是不對的，根本是錯誤，而且有害於健康，允其是做我這樣職業的人。在拍戲時，在家裹，在一切的地方，只有我孤獨的一人，因此，我的個性漸漸變得特殊起來，變得非常自私古怪。近來我覺得我自己極端地容易動怒，當我尋不到洗手的藥水，和常穿的皮鞋，我就會駡人，甚至會感到這世界是冷酷的，並沒陽光包圍着我，在一切陰暗的地方，才有微小的我存在着。」瑙　似乎很傷感，停了許久，才　下去說：</p>
<p>「在我家中，我要吃什　就是什麼，沒有人來干涉或批評我，我要出去就出去了，我要回家就回家了，從來不要我說一聲「再會！」或別人對我說早些回來。倘使我躺在床上，整夜不睡的看小說，也沒有人來阻止我，告訴我這是不該做的。眞的！我太自由了。但是，天呀！我恨我自己，在這樣廣大的宇宙間，爲何耍生存着孤獨而寂寞的我？</p>
<p>「還有，在報章雜誌上，登載許多關於我和賴甫德的友誼問題，我亦承認這並非全屬子虛，我的孩子都敬愛着他，我們的確有很好的友情，不過結婚我還須多多考慮。當然我願意再行結婚，因爲孩子們的緣故，我自身的緣故，確須要一個丈夫再能給我幫助與安慰。我相信一個寡婦是應該再蘸的，允其是一個富有熱情的婦人。」</p>
<p>當她在說話的時候，她一雙黑的眼珠閃閃的動，好像要流淚似的。那一副嬌艷的臉，漆黑的髮，鮮紅的脣，配着黑絲絨的長褲，上身穿着寬大的短衣，顏色是金黃與嫩綠相間，確是美艷嫵媚。你也許會問吧！「像這樣一位可愛的女子，爲什麼會過着單獨生活呢」</p>
<h3>「天長地久」的評價</h3>
<p>— 沙飛</p>
<p>我曾有十多决披讀小仲馬的「茶花女」，每决都給我以眼淚，我讓情感去劃破片片的創傷。這是文章感人之深。</p>
<p>「天長地久」，即是根據了「茶花女」的故事改編的，裏面的一些情節，大致都相同，所　異的，一個是西洋背景，一　是本地風光，還有在意識上，一個是反對封建的有力的諷刺，一個是灌輸正確的愛國意識。</p>
<p>全劇共五幕，前二幕，較冷靜沉悶，似乎演員們只有死的軀亮的襯托，而沒有活的靈魂的表顯。從第三幕起，就直是包圍在緊張的氛圍裹了。</p>
<p>維拉飾茶花女，秦煒演胡至聖，他們在第三慕裹的針鋒相對，是全劇晨好的一個塲面。胡至聖一句句逼她，要她離開自己的兒子，要她知道最偉大的愛不是屬於私有的，要她鼓勵或是說激動胡亞敏的爲國效勞，總之是耍她勇敢地犧牲一切。茶花女在這一時期所傳達的外表與內心的苦痛，關牽全劇的命脈；維拉演來很好，她的臉孔刻刻在變，聲調時時在換，而一舉一動，都能把觀衆的心抓住了。</p>
<p>第四幕，茶花女與胡亞敏舊雨重逢，同來者有金百萬。於是展開了決鬥的對白。</p>
<p>演胡亞敏的喬奇，他一方嘲笑金百萬（邵帆飾），一面痛駡茶花女，語語切齒，句句有力。可惜邵帆的金百萬，表情與動作，生硬一點，似乎還不够刺激。</p>
<p>第五幕是「死別」。</p>
<p>茶花女在臨終時告訴胡亞敏的話是：「願你爲國珍重！演員方面，除了這幾個重要角色以外，其他如璐珊的呂太太，孫企英的范少甫，李毅的程國卿，夏望的錢愛蘭，筆生的郭世東，秋之的唐仁穗，林娜的伶俐，亦都能稱職。</p>

<h3>American Independence Day: Roosevelt Broadcasts to the Nation: The Hard-Won Liberation is Facing Disaster, Urging the People to Prepare for Sacrifice to Uphold Freedom</h3>
<p>United Press, Hyde Park, 5th: President Roosevelt warned the American people yesterday, saying, "America cannot stand alone as a happy and prosperous free prairie in the desert of dictatorship for long." He also called upon the people to resist attempts to divide their morale and unity. In order to protect this "free prairie" and ensure freedom of the seas, America is now engaged in "a serious, great, and united endeavor." However, he stated that unity alone is not enough, and America now needs "swift and effective hard work." The President made these remarks in a nationwide broadcast on Independence Day. He said, "When we solemnly reaffirm the great oath to our country and our flag, we should deeply believe that in addition to the oath, we must contribute our labor, our will, and, when necessary, our lives." Roosevelt stated that in the current crisis, Americans have the same responsibilities as Americans in 1776. In 1776, we fought for the great ideal that "government should derive its power from the consent of the governed, securing... freedom." In the century and a half since then, this spirit of human liberty has prevailed throughout the world. However, in our time, this ideal has been opposed by a new resistance arising from new tyrannical regimes in recent years. The fundamental spirit of 1776 is being attacked overseas and threatened at home. Any American who believes that tyrannical rule can conquer human liberty elsewhere but allow liberty to remain intact in America alone is living in a fantasy. Such a view is a naive illusion and an inappropriate belief that leads to the downfall of nations. If Americans wave the flag and reaffirm their belief in freedom but stop there, they are being too simplistic. Those of us who stay awake at night and carefully analyze world affairs should know that we cannot protect freedom today with swords and guns alone. We also know that we cannot protect freedom within our own borders when our neighbors on the left and right lose their freedom. This is why we are currently engaged in a serious, great, and united endeavor to defend the freedom of this globe and the oceans. We not only need unity but also speed and effective work and will stop espionage activities that penetrate our country and bomb our armories."</p>
<p>International News Service, Hyde Park, 5th: President Roosevelt delivered a nationwide broadcast speech of only 447 words on Independence Day yesterday, but it was filled with sharp words, making the people deeply aware that the freedom and liberation that were hard-won in 1776 are now facing disaster.</p>
<h3>Independence Day Ceremony is Solemn: American People Pledge Allegiance</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th: As America faces many troubles abroad and actively strengthens its military at home, it commemorated Independence Day yesterday with unprecedented solemnity. After President Roosevelt announced that the American people must sacrifice their lives if necessary to uphold freedom, the people pledged allegiance to the flag. The President spoke from Hyde Park with a very solemn tone. After the President's speech, Attorney General Stone followed, leading the national audience in pledging allegiance to the flag. The Civil Defense Administration had made arrangements in advance to have Americans everywhere temporarily stop working in order to participate in the celebration ceremony. Therefore, at that time, car drivers stopped on the road, and soldiers stood at attention in the camps, all listening silently to the radio broadcast. Under Stone's guidance, they all pledged allegiance to the American flag and the republic it represents. In some places, it was raining, and fireworks could not be set off. However, in other places, people were excited and eagerly set off fireworks, as fireworks must be manufactured again when world peace is restored according to national defense procedures. Therefore, this fireworks display was the most grand in many years. Americans were greatly moved by the news that Independence Day was also being celebrated enthusiastically in the United Kingdom. On this day, traffic accidents still occurred everywhere in the United States as in previous years. In the first few hours, it was reported that twenty-two people had died as a result.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th: Supreme Court Justice Jackson urged Americans yesterday to reaffirm their belief in democratic government in order to defeat the "malicious policy of conquering others" by dictatorial countries. Jackson said in a National Day speech that the "Declaration of Independence" gave hope to the enslaved people of the world. He also stated that conquered countries drew inspiration from national rights to resist, change, or abolish existing governments that destroy life, liberty, and happiness.</p>
<h3>American Beliefs and Nazi Ideologies: The Two Cannot Coexist in the World</h3>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 5th: U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre delivered a speech yesterday during the celebration of July 4th, saying that the seriousness of the situation in 1941 cannot be compared with that of 1776, because in the past it was only a question of the freedom of a few colonies, while today it is a question of the rights of all mankind. We can close our ears and eyes and not ask about the affairs of other countries, but we will not be able to escape its influence in the end. No country can undermine the orderly procedures of international law without harming the people of other countries, as evidenced by Japan's actions in Northeast China and Italy's actions in Abyssinia. The emergence of Nazi philosophy proves the legitimacy of naked force and rule, so Nazi laws are the laws of the strong, disregarding humanity and only considering national power. The world, though large, cannot allow Nazi ideology and American beliefs to coexist in the world. One of the two must go. We pray to God that this is not about America going to war, but if it is, then we call upon God to help us, for we have no other choice. Britain is currently fighting with its back against the wall for what we depend on for survival. Without American aid, it will surely fail, and Britain's failure will leave the Americas alone to face both Europe and Asia.</p>
<h3>Burmese Defense: Actively Enhanced</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 5th: Lieutenant General MacLeod, the commanding officer in Burma, said in a broadcast speech last night that Burma and parts of the Far East are establishing air bases so that the commander-in-chief can use the strength of the British Air Force in the most appropriate locations. Burma is currently building minesweepers and patrol boats, and modern mechanized tanks and other equipment are now arriving in a steady stream. The army has also been greatly expanded. A large number of troops, military supplies, and mechanized equipment have been arriving in Burma for some time, and the establishment of Burmese defenses is to fulfill its mission in the overall plan for imperial defense. Burma has added many airfields to prepare for the increased defensive squadrons to go to Malaya and India.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>On Red Army Strategy</h3>
<p>Two weeks after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the German army has made some local progress on the long 1,500-mile front. From the Baltic coast in the north to the Dniester River basin in the south, the German army is almost all-out, but the Red Army's strong resistance is not entirely disappointing. As of now, although the Nazi army has gained some strongholds after paying a heavy price, it has failed to fully exert its so-called "blitzkrieg" capabilities. In fact, it has not yet caused any decisive effect on the overall war situation; because the Soviet authorities have declared their determination to fight a protracted war, the world is even more concerned about the German army's deep penetration. The Soviet Union is not comparable to France, which every commentator has seen. With the battle line stretched so long, Stalin's declared scorched-earth policy and guerrilla warfare are the "traditional masterpiece" of the Russians. Unless the entire Soviet Union can be crushed like Poland or France in eight weeks, then anyone with a little common sense cannot help but "worry" for Germany—worry that it will eventually repeat the mistakes of Napoleon in the past.</p>
<p>Reviewing the German army's achievements in the past two weeks, the ones that are more worthy of attention can be divided into three routes: (1) In the Baltic region, it has occupied the entire territory of Lithuania and half of Latvia, and will now try to invade Estonia, in order to meet with the German army descending from the Karelian Isthmus in Finland to attack Leningrad; (2) In the Belarusian Union, the German army has crossed Minsk, and according to Berlin propaganda, it has even crossed the Berezina River and is directly attacking Smolensk. This route is the most deeply penetrating branch of the German army and also the most important offensive, with the aim of directly attacking Moscow; (3) In western Ukraine, after occupying Lviv, Lutsk, Dubno and other places, the German army is now attacking Zhytomyr, with the aim of seizing the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, so that it can echo the military actions from Romania attacking Odessa in the future.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that what should be paid the most attention to at present is the central line of the Berezina River battle; assuming that Smolensk is lost, Moscow will naturally feel a direct threat. At that time, in order to stabilize the central government and continue the war of resistance, the Soviet authorities may have to move the capital to the interior. Regarding this, one theory is that it should be moved to Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains, and another theory is that it should even be moved to Omsk in the Irtysh River basin in Siberia. In any case, based on China's combat experience and achievements, as long as the Soviet nation is united and hates the enemy, even if the capital is moved inland and the war zone is expanded, it will not only not harm the final victory in the entire war of resistance process, but also be a most effective and wise strategy for dealing with enemies who are good at quick battles and quick decisions.</p>
<p>Soviet leader Stalin has clearly understood the importance of this strategy, so in his broadcast speech to the nation on the 3rd of this month, he announced the adoption of this strategy to the whole country in the clearest tone and the most resolute language. He first acknowledged that the German army had gained a short-term advantage, saying, "The fall of a part of Soviet territory is due to the fact that the situation at the beginning of the war was favorable to the German army and unfavorable to the Soviet Union," because one side was at war and had already heavily concentrated its forces to launch an offensive, while the other side was hastily responding to the war and was still waiting to be mobilized, so it could not avoid suffering some losses first; however, he believed that this was of no major importance. He encouraged the people of the whole country to concentrate their efforts to fight for freedom and for the motherland. He was confident that "final victory will belong to the Soviet Union," which echoes the Chinese nation's confidence that the war of resistance will surely be won. Not only that, Stalin also instructed the people to implement a scorched-earth policy, saying, "When the Red Army has to withdraw, all vehicles must be withdrawn completely, and not even a train, a pound of grain, or a gallon of gasoline must be left for the enemy to use. The livestock and food of the farms should be handed over to the authorities to be transported to the rear, and anything that cannot be moved should be destroyed." This method of clearing the fields is the most effective way to defeat enemies who are deeply penetrated and aim to plunder resources. If the Red Army authorities can make good use of this strategy in the future, persisting without giving up, so that another long-term war of attrition comparable to China's can be launched in the vast Soviet territory to tie down Hitler's mechanized forces, then it is firmly believed that once winter arrives, these so-called "fast-moving divisions" will all fall into the "snowdrifts" and be unable to move.</p>
<h3>The Purpose of Japan's Establishment of a "Safe Zone" is Actually to Blockade Shipping to the Soviet Union: The U.S. Believes it Conflicts with the Policy of Maintaining Freedom of the High Seas and will Cause an Emergency Situation between the U.S. and Japan; Britain Believes that Japan will Advance South or Even Occupy Vietnam</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th: Since Tokyo announced that Japan is considering establishing a "safe zone" in the Northwest Pacific, diplomatic circles here commented yesterday that Japan is actually trying to establish a de facto blockade, prohibiting merchant ships from transporting supplies from Vladivostok to the Soviet Union. This de facto blockade will directly conflict with the U.S. policy of maintaining freedom of the high seas and will cause a serious state of tension between the U.S. and Japan. According to well-informed sources here, the Japanese claim that the establishment of the safe zone is the same as the safe zone near the Western Hemisphere is inaccurate, because the Japanese safe zone is intended to prevent all merchant ships from transporting supplies to the Soviet Union, while the American safe zone is intended to facilitate normal merchant shipping. The American safe zone does not stop any merchant ships, and American patrols do not prevent warships of belligerent countries from traveling freely, but only prevent warships of belligerent countries from engaging in "combat activities" within the zone. Therefore, the meaning of the safe zone is to prevent warships from taking warlike actions and to prevent them from hindering merchant shipping within the zone. Authoritative sources believe that if the Japanese think of using the American safe zone as a precedent to achieve their goal of restricting cargo ships in the waters near Japan, they will once again distort the American doctrine. Officials recall that the Japanese have also distorted the American doctrine in the past in an attempt to equate their ambition to achieve hegemony in East Asia with America's Monroe Doctrine. At that time, American officials repeatedly pointed out that the Monroe Doctrine was intended to prevent foreigners from further implementing colonial policies in the Western Hemisphere and to prevent foreigners from engaging in political activities in the New World. Officials also said that, furthermore, America's "safe zone" is recognized by twenty-one independent republics and is not a suggestion made by Japan at will in the Western Pacific.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 5th: After studying the situation in the Far East, some American diplomatic observers expressed pessimism about the chances of U.S.-Japan rapprochement. Although Under Secretary of State Welles hopes that Japan's sudden change in its foreign policy may maintain peace in the Pacific, officials here fear that Japan's war machine will eventually move to the Soviet Siberian coastal provinces. Because Japan continues to conduct business negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, some observers believe that Japan does not have any signs of advancing south for the time being. However, some people believe that Japan's new movement of territorial expansion is brewing. Qualified observers here believe that this action of Japan is an attack on Siberia. It is pointed out that if this move succeeds, Japan can remove the military threat from the north and approach new resources.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 5th: Officials and non-officials gradually believed yesterday that Japan is about to abandon its publicly announced policy of not getting involved in the vortex of war, re-adopting a policy of advancing south, and believe that in possible actions, Japan may even occupy French Indochina. Many believe that Japan may attempt to obtain a naval base in Cam Ranh Bay, because in this part of the world, that place is the best natural harbor. Many also believe that Japan will also extend its air force to the south of Indochina.</p>
<p>International News Service, Tokyo, 5th: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka and Army Minister Lieutenant General Tojo yesterday visited the Japanese Emperor to report on "matters under direct jurisdiction." Observers believe that the Foreign Minister and the Army Minister's visit to the Japanese Emperor may have discussed the military aspects of Japan's new policy.</p>
<h3>The Strength of the Far Eastern Red Army Has Not Diminished: Ota's Remarks upon Arriving in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th: Ota, the Japanese acting consul-general in Vladivostok, returned here today.

Newspapers and radio stations publish very little war news and are full of heroic deeds of the Red Army. When asked about the US aid to the Soviet Union, Ota replied that ships loaded with food and machines from America arrived in Vladivostok before the war, but have not been seen since the war began.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Notes for the Thai-Vietnam Treaty Takes Place the Day Before Yesterday: Thailand to Receive Ceded Land on August 1st</h3>

The ratification of the draft guarantees and the political understanding between Japan and Vietnam and between Japan and Thailand has also been exchanged. The Japanese representative and the French representative also exchanged the Japanese-Vietnam Navigation Treaty, the Japanese-French agreement on Japanese-Vietnamese tariff commerce, and the ratification of the method of saving money. The above-mentioned ratifications were all exchanged at the official meeting held yesterday. The Information Bureau also said that the draft on the organization and work of the boundary commission and the draft on the implementation of the regulations on the demilitarized zone related to (the middle of the peace) have also been exchanged and ratified. The Japanese Emperor allowed the Japanese government to sign this draft yesterday. According to the demarcation agreement, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam will each send nine members of the commission and five assistant members to define the boundaries on land and rivers in the area, then mark them and draw them into maps. This mixed commission will be chaired by one Japanese representative, and the expenses will be borne equally by the Thai and French governments. It is said that the Thai government will provide all necessary facilities to enable the commission to carry out its duties.</p>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 5th: News here today said that the land ceded by Vietnam to Thailand will fly the Thai flag after August 1.

<h3>Ayasawa Returns Home, Talks about Japanese-Dutch Relations</h3>
<p>Reuters, Taipei, Taiwan, 5th: Ayasawa, the Japanese chief representative at the recent economic conference between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia, said yesterday upon arriving here that the Dutch East Indies authorities sincerely wished to improve relations with Japan. Although both sides made six months of efforts, it was a pity that they failed to conclude a written agreement. However, in the final decision-making meeting with the Dutch East Indies leader Staes, a certain degree of understanding was obtained. Since then, the attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities has greatly changed. Their understanding of Japan has become deeper. The advice of Japanese Consul General Ishizawa to the Japanese expatriates in the Dutch East Indies to remain calm, exercise self-restraint, and continue to do business as usual has greatly brightened the atmosphere. The members of the Japanese delegation stayed here for one night and then boarded the original ship this afternoon and set sail for Kobe, where they are expected to arrive on July 8.</p>

<h3>U.S. Army Greatly Expanded: Preparing to Enter the Battlefield; Two Elite Divisions Receive Landing Training; Special Forces for Mountain Warfare are Being Organized; Marshall Says the Air Force has also Increased Fivefold</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th: U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall said yesterday that overseas troops have increased from 45,300 to 116,700, an increase of more than double. This is part of the effort to keep U.S. defenses constantly ready, and the air force teams on the U.S. mainland and overseas bases have also increased fivefold. Two elite divisions with the latest military equipment, which is beyond any other equipment, have been trained with the Navy and Marine Corps in landing operations as required by the expeditionary force. At the same time, a special force division for mountain warfare is being studied and organized. The U.S. Army has expanded from 174,000 to 1,400,000 in the past two years. When training this huge new army, our goal is to make this team ready to enter the battlefield and exert its combat power as time goes on. Marshall has now completed a report and submitted it to Secretary of War Stimson, having served as Army Chief of Staff for two years.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, New York, 5th: General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, has requested that U.S. troops be deployed to various overseas countries. Officials have not yet approved it. President Roosevelt is unwilling to state his position on this move. Secretary of War Stimson is unwilling to make any statements to the newspapers. A Washington correspondent for the New York Tribune said that Marshall's request is not surprising to those who support the government. They said that this move is just one link in the government's plan to give the President and the Department of the Army the freedom to deploy troops. People on this side believe that the government must immediately ask Congress to formally declare a state of emergency in order to reduce the existing confusion. Opposition members are very frank in their criticism of Marshall's request. Taft said that U.S. troops should not go beyond the Western Hemisphere until the Senate declares war.</p>
<h3>The United States Has Decided to Retrain the National Guard</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th: Major General Wicom, Director of the National Guard Bureau, announced yesterday that 287,700 National Guard officers have expressed their loyalty to continue to serve during this extraordinary emergency. He firmly believes that the opposition of some people to the Congressional decision that National Guard training must be for more than one year is because they are not familiar with the procedures and grades of the National Guard. The current administrative leaders have decided to retrain the National Guard, considering the importance of national defense.</p>
<h3>U.S. Patrols Detain Japanese Ships: Must Unload Cargo Before Being Allowed to Leave the Philippines</h3>
<p>United Press, Manila, 5th: Customs tax officer Lyon recently said that the Japanese government ordered the recall of the cargo ship Nojima Maru of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company in Japan. It will not be allowed to leave Philippine waters unless it unloads the export goods loaded in the Philippines or the export control agency's license. He also said that the ship's port permit has been revoked because it is difficult to determine whether the goods it loaded can reach the United States. The U.S. Neutrality Patrol is said to have taken steps yesterday to prevent the Japanese ship from suddenly leaving the Philippines, because two other Japanese ships carrying chromite to the United States had previously been requisitioned by the Japanese government and unloaded their cargo in Japanese ports. Recently, Diet members Oyama, who recently visited here, said that the Japanese government's withdrawal of Japanese ships traveling between the US and the Philippines is a reaction to the recent US government's restriction on the shipment of key raw materials to Japan. "If we can obtain the US and Philippine goods we need, we will definitely send ships to travel everywhere. He also said that the requisitioned Japanese ships may be diverted to South America, because the things we need are also in South America. Oyama will fly to Hong Kong tomorrow. He also said that he believes that the oil talks between Japan and the Dutch East Indies may reopen. Now the Philippine government is in the process of negotiating because Japan has withdrawn Japanese ships, intending to release the four detained Dutch ships as soon as possible for supply. If the Dutch ships are released by the Philippine authorities, they can sail between the US and the Philippines.</p>

<h3>China Resolutely Severed Relations with Germany and Italy; Impressed British Government and Public; Initiated a Bold Diplomatic Policy; Determined to Fight to the End for Democracy</h3>
<p>London: Authoritative British sources commented that the Chinese government's decision to resolutely sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers after Germany and Italy recognized Nanjing was quite satisfactory. The decisive action of China's new Foreign Minister stood in stark contrast to the Japanese government's hesitant and fearful attitude towards the Soviet-German war. Foreign Minister Guo's stern condemnation of the Axis powers had made a deep impression on the British. It was believed that Foreign Minister Guo had begun to implement a bold diplomatic policy, namely: (1) to realize Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's determination to fight to the end for democracy and to unite all peace-loving countries in the world, including the ABC countries mentioned by Foreign Minister Guo before leaving here, plus the Soviet Union. Foreign Minister Guo's proposal has now been proven in fact, demonstrating his foresight; (3) to realize the Chinese people's determination to fight bravely. The purpose of the Axis powers' recognition of Nanjing seemed to be to reduce Japan's displeasure, as Germany's sudden attack on the Soviet Union had put Japan in a rather embarrassing position. Secondly, it was one of the conditions of exchange between the two sides. Although the content of the exchange conditions was not clear, it must have been to win over Japan to continue colluding with the Axis powers and play a role similar to Italy in the Far East, flanking the Soviet rear. It can be asserted that the Axis powers have abandoned their facade of friendship with China. Germany clearly hopes that Japan will advance north or south, leading to a large-scale conflict with Britain, the Soviet Union, the United States, and the Netherlands, so that Germany can safely rule all of Europe.

<h3>British and American Cooperation; Fight for Democracy; Australian Prime Minister Delivers Speech; Portuguese Ships Hoist Flags to Salute the United States</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: Australia and Canada both released speeches yesterday on British-American cooperation in the fight for democracy to commemorate American Independence Day. Australian Prime Minister Menzies said, "Americans and Australians are standing on common ground. Australians are increasingly convinced that Americans will never tolerate Nazi domination of the world. American aid has greatly increased the rate of victory and greatly reduced the evils of war. Therefore, Americans, like Australians, have the responsibility not only to free those living today, but also to free future generations from hardship. Australia is fighting not only for the freedom of Australia, but also for the freedom of the United States and the world. This is Australia's honor." The Australian Prime Minister concluded by saying that the two peoples, whose common ancestors conquered the wilderness with grace and courage, will never succumb to a world order that eliminates individual rights. When he was in the United States last month, he felt very much at home because not only did they speak, think, and act the same, but they were equally committed to upholding the rights of mankind. The Canadian Automobile Association Joint Conference stated that there are currently more than 6,000 Americans serving in the Canadian Army. Britain is a bastion of freedom, now guarded by the fighting spirit of the British military and civilians.</p>

<h3>British Aircraft Raid Germany in Broad Daylight; Bremen is the Target; Docks Hit and Catch Fire</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: The Ministry of Aviation announced that British Royal Air Force Blenheim bombers again attacked Bremen, Germany, this morning in broad daylight. The British Royal Air Force, which launched this decisive raid, had carried out a heavy bombing of the port of Bremen and the Essen location of the Krupp factory the night before, only an hour or two apart. According to a communiqué issued by the Ministry of Aviation last night, British aircraft bombed at low altitude, some descending to only fifty feet above the ground. Shells hit large factories in the dock area, immediately causing fire and explosions. The freight yard and railway intersection in the northwest of the city were also bombed. Freight cars and aircraft at the airfield were strafed. British aircraft also bombed targets on the Frisian Islands off the German coast and strafed barracks and artillery positions.

Although the United Press reporter was a considerable distance from the bombing site, the explosions of bombs in the sea and the flashes of anti-aircraft fire could be clearly seen. Judging from the intensity of the anti-aircraft fire, it was clear that the German aircraft were easy to hit targets.

<h3>The Strength of Resistance is Firm; Soviet Army Repelled German Troops Crossing the River; Fierce Battles are Underway on Various Front Lines; The Soviets Claim that German Casualties Have Now Reached 700,000</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th: The Soviet Information Bureau released the following war report: "On the night of the 3rd, our army continued to fiercely engage the enemy in Klimanchi, Spara, and Ternopol (southeastern Poland). In other areas, there were only outpost activities and minor clashes. In the area of Borisov (northeast of Minsk), several enemy vanguards attempted to cross the Berezina River, but were repelled everywhere by us. A part of the enemy attempted to break into the south of Ternopol, but our army resisted throughout the night, preventing the enemy from advancing. The battle is still underway. Also, on July 2nd, our air force destroyed 61 enemy aircraft, and our own aircraft lost 28."</p>
<p>United Press, London, 5th: It was heard here that Moscow wireless broadcast a Soviet war bulletin stating that even though German troops repeatedly attempted to cross the Berezina and Prut Rivers, they were all fiercely repelled by the Soviet army. The German army suffered heavy casualties. According to Moscow wireless, there has been no actual change on the Soviet front. Fighting continues in the areas of Murmansk, Kandahar, and the Karelian Isthmus. In the areas of Borisov and Bobruisk, battles were fought throughout the night on the Berezina and Prut Rivers. The enemy troops repeatedly attempted to cross the river, but were repelled by our firepower. The enemy troops suffered heavy losses on land and water. Because the enemy troops were unable to advance in the Trakana Pril area, they have turned to attack the areas of Novogrudok and Volinsk. Our army won victories throughout the night, preventing the eastward advance of enemy tanks.</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 5th: According to the official communiqué released yesterday, the Red Army's resistance to the German's massive advance on the defense line in the Tevitzk region was quite successful. The defense route along the Berezina River straight to the north of Leningrad, is claimed to have been beaten back by the Soviet army's advance troops, and then changed to a new position to resist the Nazi's main force. Fierce fighting has recently taken place around Ternopol in the southern territory, which is located in southern Poland and serves as the western border for defending the route to Ukraine. From July 3rd to 4th, fierce fighting occurred throughout the night on the Bobruisk and Vovno front lines. Other front lines only had nighttime patrol activities and minor contacts.</p>

<h3>Compilation of German War Reports</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: A Soviet news agency transmitted that the Soviet army is currently retreating on the old Soviet border in 1938. Berlin now expects the German army to have a new fierce battle with the main Soviet army along the so-called Stalin Line. The Berlin Nazi Party said that the Stalin Line extends from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea, with closely connected fortresses. The Red Army must try to contain the German army's advance on this line. The German army and its allies are now rapidly approaching the Stalin Line. The Nazi side believes that the Soviet side does not have much hope of holding this line for long, because the Red Army has suffered heavy losses in eastern Poland and the Baltic countries. The German news agency also claimed that the Soviet army, which was heavily deployed on the border, has been dispersed and broken through by the German army. The Soviet army's equipment and aircraft losses are extremely heavy and cannot be replenished. At the same time, the German side admitted that large-scale battles are still underway behind the German front, because the trapped Soviet army continues to resist stubbornly. The German army is currently searching for scattered Soviet troops throughout the area. The Ukrainian capital, Kiev, is gradually facing a new threat from the south. The German side said that the Hungarian army in the south has crossed the Carpathian Mountains and reached the plains, and has joined forces with the right wing of the German army in eastern Poland. The Soviet army, which stubbornly resisted in the narrow passes of the Carpathian Mountains, was defeated by the Hungarian army on Thursday. The Hungarian air force assisted the army in fiercely attacking Soviet columns. German newspapers continued to carry various messages indicating the Soviet army's determination to counterattack, one of which said, "A German team in the Dubno district has been containing the fierce attack of hundreds of Soviet 50-ton tanks for three days. The German anti-tank guns constantly bombarded, piercing the armor of the Soviet tanks and destroying their steel towers, destroying many of the heaviest Soviet tanks. The German team then attacked, seizing six Soviet artillery pieces and a large number of armored vehicles." The German side also reported that it has captured 123 aircraft fields and all modern equipment built by the Soviet side in the Baltic countries last year, including 11 that were intact. In a surprise attack by the German army near Daugavpils, three more aircraft fields were captured. In the past 24 hours, 98 Soviet aircraft have been destroyed, including 22 destroyed on the ground and 76 destroyed in air combat. German dive bombers destroyed a train near Murmansk, and in the central region (Belarus), Soviet trains, stations, railways, bridges, and concentrated troops were also heavily bombed by German aircraft, destroying 34 tanks.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th: It was revealed here today that a Soviet army unit in a certain section of the Baltic Sea was completely annihilated. Two motorized divisions, two infantry divisions, and one armored brigade were wiped out. Three more battalions lost their ability to resist. A large number of military supplies were intercepted.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 5th: Berlin wireless claimed that the Hungarian army has occupied Horomia and Stanislav in Polish Galicia. The German army has been pursuing the enemy in the Baltic front. The Finnish army continued to advance.</p>
<h3>German and Romanian Armies Divide into Four Routes; Surround Kiev</h3>
<p>Havas, Somewhere on the Soviet border, 4th: After the German army broke through the Red Army's front line on the northern route, the German-Romanian allied forces on the right wing also began to attack on the southern route yesterday. They have crossed the Prut River in the Jassy to Danube section and have crossed the Danube River in Ismail (Jassy and Ismail are both in Bessarabia). Now they are advancing in four routes: (1) From Ismail along the highway to Xitadidiaerba; (2) From Jassy to Kishinev; (3) From Jassy to Bā'ěrdì; (Xitadidiaerba, Kishinev, and Bā'ěrdì are all in Bessarabia) (4) From Storoquinai (in North Bukovina) straight to Hairerda (in Moldova, Romania). The German army encountered strong resistance in several places, but did not encounter major obstacles in other places. The Red Army has withdrawn to the Dnieper River and is fighting a rearguard battle in the front between Ternopol (in Poland) and Sairnochi (in Romania). The German strategy is to encircle Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, in a pincer movement from Poland, Volgrad Volinsk, to the Danube Delta. The German army that crossed the Lehina River in the north is also advancing on Kiev.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 5th: Moscow wireless broadcast today that the German army has crossed the Prut River in several strongholds, which is equivalent to the German army having already invaded Bessarabia, Romanian territory under Soviet occupation.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 5th: National Broadcasting Company received a Roman wireless report today, saying that after the German and Romanian armies entered 60 miles into the Soviet border, they have reached the Dniester River.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Occurs on the Hango Peninsula; Three Soviet Warships Cut Off From Return Route</h3>
<p>Havas, Kin械, Switzerland, 4th: According to news from Finland, the Soviet battleships "October Revolution", "Marat", and "Kirov" are still cruising in the area of ​​Kronstadt and Baltiysk, but because the German army has made rapid progress on the coast of ​​Pozha's Sea, their return route has been cut off, or they may enter Swedish territorial waters.</p>
<p>Havas, Helsinki, 5th: A wireless station in the city broadcast this morning that Finnish and Soviet troops are now engaged in fierce fighting near the Hango Peninsula. The Soviet force there is between 20,000 and 25,000. At the same time, the Finnish Navy has blockaded the Soviet naval and air bases established on Hango Island (south of the peninsula). The island is located at the southwesternmost corner of Finland. The Soviet-Finnish armistice agreement in 1940 stipulated that it be ceded to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>United Press, City of Sweden, 5th: The Finnish High Command issued its first communiqué, describing the war in the northern region, saying that the Swedish-Finnish troops have passed through the Soviet border at several points along the 600-mile border. A well-informed source in the Finnish capital said that the Finnish army is conducting a successful attack on Hango, the naval base in western Finland. The land was ceded to the Soviet Union by Finland last year.</p>
<h3>Minsk Red Army Surrounded; Germans Claim 20,000 Captured</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (International News Agency) – The Berezina River, where Napoleon lost 20,000 soldiers retreating from Moscow, was crossed yesterday by Hitler's mechanized units, which then advanced beyond the point reached by German forces over 23 years ago. According to German military spokespersons, the entire Red Army front is retreating in disarray as German troops advance at every point along the 2,000-mile front. The spokespersons stated that 20,000 Red Army soldiers surrounded by German forces in the Minsk area surrendered after assassinating their political commissars.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas Agency) – It has just been officially announced here that Soviet political commissars wearing Red Army uniforms will be treated as prisoners of war after capture.</p>
<h3>Soviets Prepare for Long-Term Resistance; Napoleon's Defeat Serves as a Cautionary Tale</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Havas Agency) – Military observers here recently stated that it is still too early to say whether Stalin is adopting General Kutuzov's strategy from the Napoleonic Wars to block the German advance. Regarding the current war situation, the Red Army has launched major counter-offensives in the central and southern sectors, while adopting a defensive posture in the northern sector, offering determined resistance to the German forces. According to Soviet war reports, the Soviet authorities deeply hope that after the introduction of new-style giant tanks and twin-engine bombers, the battlefront situation can be turned from defeat to victory. Various phenomena indicate that the Soviet Union is preparing for a long-term war of attrition. On the one hand, it is actively mobilizing the people and organizing local defense forces. Factories and collective farms have received large quantities of arms and begun training. All cadre personnel are filled with loyal communists to prepare for future guerrilla warfare. On the other hand, a scorched earth policy is being adopted. All materials in the occupied areas are being transported out as much as possible. If it is too late to move them due to the urgency of the situation, they are destroyed to prevent them from benefiting the enemy. Stalin has ordered all materials within Estonia to be moved to Leningrad, and similar measures are being taken elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Turkish Prime Minister's Broadcast Clarifies Foreign Policy; Commitment to Anglo-Soviet Treaty Remains Unwavering; Reconstructing the Balkans Based on the Principle of Independence</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 5th (Reuters) – During a broadcast speech yesterday on German-Turkish relations, Turkish Prime Minister Saydam's radio waves were disrupted. It is understood that Saydam's remarks about Churchill and Turkish-British relations were particularly affected. Saydam's speech briefly stated that the British handling of the situation in Iraq was moderate and far-sighted, and the guarantee of Iraq's independence was worthy of Turkish praise and congratulations. Turkey's neutral stance in the Soviet-German war is in compliance with its treaty obligations, and from the perspective of Turkey's interests, Turkey will continue to maintain this attitude in the future. Referring to Britain's attitude towards the treaty, Saydam concluded: "This attitude of Britain is a manifestation of the confidence possessed by a gentlemanly nation." He also stated that the major crisis sweeping the ground has now reached the Turkish border. Turkey's far-sighted attitude since the beginning of this year has been proven appropriate by recent events. Turkey earnestly hopes that the future development of the Balkan Peninsula will be based on the principle of the independence of the Balkan countries. Turkey is satisfied with the prospect of realizing this desire.</p>

<h3>After the Fall of Palmyra, British Continue to Occupy Deir ez-Zor; Rumors of Armistice Negotiations in Progress</h3>
<p>Jerusalem, 5th (Reuters) – It is learned here that in addition to capturing Palmyra, Allied forces in Syria have also occupied Deir ez-Zor, greatly enhancing their position in eastern Syria. These two cities were strongholds of the Vichy forces in the region. Deir ez-Zor is located 120 miles northeast of Palmyra on the Euphrates River. The Allied forces occupying this famous grassland can use it as a base to attack the important cities of Homs and Aleppo to the north. Most of those who occupied Deir ez-Zor are Indian troops, who mainly set out from Iraq and crossed the border into Syria near Kamar. Indian troops have also achieved military successes in the Damascus area, continuously launching surprise attacks to assist the Allied forces in entering the Syrian capital.</p>
<p>Vichy, 5th (Reuters) – A communique issued by General Dentz, commander of the Vichy forces in Syria, did not mention the fall of Deir ez-Zor, but stated that "enemy tanks have been in contact with Vichy forces along one route, while Vichy forces in southern Syria have repelled Allied attacks, capturing many enemies. Patrols and artillery units are active along the coast south of Beirut. French aircraft are still actively bombing and strafing Allied forces."</p>
<p>Ankara, 5th (United Press) – According to reports here yesterday, the Syrian war may be ended within a week by peaceful negotiations between the two sides' armies. Although British sources deny the possibility of an armistice agreement being established, it is widely believed that negotiations are already underway secretly. It is reported that Mr. Mesnil, assistant to the French High Commissioner, has held talks with Mr. Rossom, the representative of the German-Italian Armistice Commission sent to Syria, in the past ten days. It is rumored that the two officials will soon return to Aleppo in an attempt to conduct armistice negotiations with the British side here.</p>
<h3>Vichy Envoy Returns Home from Turkey</h3>
<p>Vichy, 4th (Havas Agency) – Mr. Mesnil, assistant to the Cabinet High Commissioner, representing Marshal Pétain, went to Istanbul, the capital of Turkey, to meet with various important figures in that country. There have been rumors that the purpose of this trip was to request Turkey to allow France to transport arms through its territory to Syria or to allow the French forces in Syria to withdraw back to France through its territory. This statement has been denied by political figures here, who stated that Mesnil only carried a letter from Marshal Pétain to Turkish President Ismet. When he met with President Ismet, the President asked him to convey his congratulations on France's revival to Marshal Pétain. The relations between France and Turkey have always been extremely close, and it is certain that they will become even more cordial in the future. The Franco-Turkish alliance established in June 1939 has also been reiterated by both sides. At this time of tension in the Near East situation, the significance of Mesnil's trip is self-evident. In addition, it is possible to resolve trade issues between the two countries, that is, to extend the validity period of the current commercial agreement.</p>

<h3>Rumor of Banks Suspending Futures Trading Next Monday Causes Surge in Foreign Exchange Buying</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in official rates posted by HSBC. However, the black market for British and American currencies experienced renewed tightness due to rumors that banks would suspend futures trading next Monday. Chinese speculators tended to cover short positions in US dollars worth one million, and banks such as Hua Bi and Favreau also absorbed dollars. Although Sino-American Trading offered to sell, it was difficult to curb the strong buying, and the market closed at the tightest price. British currency was at 3/4 pence at 23.4375, and US dollars at 5.21875, both tighter than HSBC's official rates. Trading was extremely active in the morning. There was no trading in the afternoon as it was Saturday.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Cover One Million USD</p>
<p>This morning's foreign exchange market overseas saw the large-scale movement close to average, Indian silver contracted downwards, US silver and US currency were all flat. London currency exchange rates were unchanged, the central bank's posted exchange rates were all flat. Domestic market opened with bank selling prices, spot British currency tightened by 0.015625 to 3 1/4 pence at 25, US dollars levelled at 5.28125. After opening, Chinese speculators bought USD 10,000 for August delivery from Hua Xing at 5.3125, but were unable to settle immediately. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax remained at 523.75%. Because Chinese and foreign merchants were willing to supply US dollars at 5.28125, and there were rumors that the stabilization fund would maintain the black market US dollar at 5.25 and that the United States would issue new $25 bills, the buying subsided temporarily. However, after 10:30 AM, a rumor suddenly spread that banks would stop supplying forward US dollars, causing panic among speculative shorts who rushed to cover their positions in July and August at 5.28125 to 5.25. Favreau, Hua Bi, and others absorbed US dollars for July at 5.25. Sino-American Trading's willingness to supply diminished at midday, and the price of gold soared beyond 6,600 yuan. Therefore, at the midday close, spot and August US dollars tightened to 5.21875 (difficult to settle and sell for August at 5.25), British gold to 3 1/4 pence at 23.4375 (also at 3 1/4 pence at 21.875), with the US dollar closing 0.0625 tighter, August 0.09375 tighter, and British currency 0.015625 tighter than the previous day's late close.</p>

<h3>Speculation Runs Wild; Gold Prices Soar; Breaching the 6,600 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw the black market surge again, with prices soaring beyond the 6,600 yuan mark. Confidence was high across the board, building on the gains made before and after the close of the previous night. Rumors of banks suspending forward foreign exchange trading next week further fueled the surge, as speculators rushed to buy up millions of US dollars. Securities firms and currency brokers in the market also joined in the buying, with numerous individual investors desperately bidding up prices. As a result, the price rose from 6,552 yuan to 6,632 yuan, a sharp increase of 93 yuan. Total trading volume for the morning was 60-70,000 taels. There was no trading in the afternoon as it was Saturday. Although prices continued to rise to 6,645 yuan, there was supply but no demand. Cash merchants Fu Kang and Yong sold 20 taels to Jin Yuan and 50 taels to Lao Qingyun, both at 280 yuan higher than the forward price. Later, Tian Yuan sold ten taels at 260 yuan higher, a rise of over 70 yuan. Ornament gold rose by 10 yuan, reaching 710 yuan. Customs gold and other types of gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Futures Rise by Nearly 100 Yuan Again</p>
<p>The market opened this morning at 9:15 AM at 6,570 yuan, a gain of 33 yuan, amidst strong buying from individual investors. Tian Yuan aggressively bought up to 6,580 yuan. It was then noted that firms like Cheng Ji, De Da, Gong Da, Da Feng, Xiang Xing Yong, Tian Yuan, and Heng Ji were selling. There were also rumors that Chinese and foreign firms were willing to supply US dollars at 5.28125, and that the US would issue new $25 bills, and that the Stabilization Fund would maintain the black market US dollar at 5.25. This halted the rise and caused a slight dip to 6,552 yuan. However, after 10:30 AM, Xiang He, Ming Feng, Chi Da, and De Fu came to absorb the supply, gradually pushing the price back up. When rumors circulated of a favorable turn for buyers and the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened again, Tian Yuan, Xin Feng Yong, Yi Da, and others also aggressively bought, and those with floating profits took the opportunity to push prices up sharply, breaking through the 6,600 yuan mark. Sellers became hesitant, and the price continued to rise to 6,632 yuan. Yi Li sold alone, and numerous small investors sold up to 6,627 yuan. The market closed at midday at 6,630 yuan, a gain of 93 yuan from the previous day's closing price. Based on the settlement price of the July US dollar at 5.21875, the price was 6,673 yuan, a squeeze of 43 yuan. After the close, the price rose to 6,638 yuan, then retreated to 6,620 yuan, and finally settled at 6,630 yuan. There was a difference of 80 yuan during the first half of the day (excluding off-market trading). In the afternoon, off-market prices rose to 6,645 yuan. There was a final seller. The cash houses' own-brand gold was sold at 260 yuan higher than the spot price, and bought in at 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Remains High at 710 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of ornament gold at silver shops rose by 10 yuan at 11:30 AM at Da Tong Heng and Xin Tong Heng, to 710 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 10 yuan.</p>
<p>US Dollars at 19 Yuan Customs</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot prices surge, with British and American pounds following with a rise of two yuan. British gold notes remained stable, with market prices remaining flat. US dollar notes opened at 18 yuan and 50 cents. After opening, Cheng Feng, Yong He, Shun Yuan, Zeng Yu, and others sold, retreating to 18 yuan 80 cents.

Japanese gold notes rose by 2 cents, with the evening market at 1 yuan and 94 cents. Korean notes were stable, with market prices remaining flat, with the evening market still at the original price of 1 yuan and 57 cents.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Market Sentiment Remains Positive</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for government bonds, after a brief small decline, recovered again. Type C bonds once again broke through the 2 yuan level. This kind of market, rising and falling rapidly, shows that those exiting are doing so, and those buying are doing so. Looking at the buying and selling activities of various firms, it is clear that the bulls are shifting positions, seemingly consolidating from a whole to smaller parts. However, whether firms like Yong Chang, Yi Tai, and Xin Fu are merely holding bonds to collect interest remains to be seen. Yesterday was Saturday, with only one trading session held, opening at 11:00 AM. Yong Chang, Xin Fu, and Yi Tai continued to buy. Yu Xing and Yi Chang also bought. Hong Da, Ding Kang, Xie Da, and De Long, representing bullish positions, sold. Ren Feng, Ren Chang, and Da Hua also sold off. Type C bonds briefly fell to 1.45 yuan, before breaking through 1 yuan again. The result was that the bulls gained the upper hand, with prices rising uniformly by 5 to 3 cents. The total trading volume was 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below. Stock</p>
<p>Stock trading saw 50 shares of China Coal Mine Company traded at a price of 146.10 yuan per share.</p>
<h3>Food: Rice Merchants Advocate Supply Shortage, But More and More Foreign Rice Arrives; Five Ships Arrive in One Day with Over 160,000 Bags; Even if Southern Advance is Achieved, Will Rice Prices Necessarily Be High?</h3>
<p>Rice hoarders are proclaiming a shortage of supply and dwindling stockpiles, thinking of taking the opportunity to raise prices and manipulate the market, hindering the people's access to food. Fortunately, large quantities of foreign rice are arriving in Shanghai. The French public company's General Joffre mail ship arrived yesterday morning, carrying 39,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, unloading at the Hongshun Tai Wharf. The Hua Lun Shipping Company's Grant steamer, carrying 27,150 bags of Public Warehouse rice from Rangoon, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. It was originally scheduled to dock at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, but the company ordered it to dock at the Roosevelt Wharf instead. Also, the French vessel Varenne, managed by Hua Lun Shipping, carrying 34,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon, also arrived yesterday morning, docking at the Long Mao Wharf in Pudong. In addition, the S.S.SnrlyothaiNawa, flying the Thai flag, carrying 47,000 bags of foreign rice from Rangoon, arrived yesterday afternoon, docking at the Gong He Xiang Wharf in Hongkou. The Thai ship's imports are managed by the British firm Lai Ci Shipping. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong steamer also arrived in Shanghai in the morning, carrying 15,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docking at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession. Whether this is the Public Warehouse's low-price rice is unknown, so it could not be verified due to the lack of information. In total, yesterday's five ships brought in a massive 162,150 bags of foreign rice. Facts speak louder than words, but rice hoarders will use the Japanese occupation of Vietnam as an excuse to raise prices. However, considering the overall situation, no matter how the situation changes, it will not be as the rice merchants hope, and rice will not be so expensive as to starve the masses. (Zu)</p>
<p>The foreign rice market recently has been in a state of uncertainty. Yesterday, it continued its fluctuating pattern of rising first and then falling. However, speculative hoarders are very greedy, with groups from the west of Shanghai and the interior being particularly active. Although there was no smooth sale for actual customers, the market price was gradually pushed up by raising and releasing prices. Not only did it rise above the previous day's closing price, but it also exceeded the previous day's highest price, once rising by as much as two or three. Subsequently, due to the continuous arrival of new supplies, retailers with surplus and profiteering floating buyers were eager to sell at high prices, and the market rose and then fell. As a result, it was still about one yuan higher than the previous evening. Number 2 Luo Siam Yinghua Company was at 144.5 yuan, while small Jiao spot was all from 150 yuan to 151 yuan, reaching as high as 151.5 yuan. Broken rice opened only at 113 yuan for medium-grade goods, with over 1,000 tons traded. There were no fewer than 20,000 bags of spot rice, but most of them were taken in by hoarders. Actual sales accounted for less than 30%, because it was expensive and difficult to transport, and demand was not strong. The local merchants were stabilized by the public sale, while the hoarders were confused by international changes and currency rumors, and were absorbing supply.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica rice and domestic rice saw different situations yesterday, and the market conditions also diverged. The South Port fresh early and late rice, due to its scarcity, became more and more popular, and the selling price continued to rise by two to three yuan, opening as high as 142 yuan, settling at 140.5 yuan. Wuxi original-packaged old japonica rice, due to the seasonal relationship, had changed in quality and lacked interest, so the market was flat, opening at 132 yuan, then falling to 127 to 128 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, whether domestic or foreign, saw a decline in sales. Although the market supply was limited, sellers still tried to hold up the price, but they were unable to do so, and could only follow the foreign rice market in presenting a firm situation. The price was similar to before, with Hong Kong high white glutinous rice selling for 123-124 yuan, medium grade for 120 yuan, special glutinous green for 114 yuan, and ordinary glutinous green for 112 yuan, settling at 108 yuan. Jin Dan domestic glutinous rice ranged from 123-124 yuan, settling at around 120 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer Sales Active; Flour Market Trends Higher Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour market saw active sales to customers and strong purchases by customers and hoarders, fueled by numerous positive news in the local market and rising prices in the financial and rice markets. Golden Dragon flour opened at 32.80 yuan and quickly rose to 33.25 yuan, with Turret flour also rising to 34 yuan, and Five Swallow brand American flour at 33.40 yuan, a gain of 4-5 cents from the previous day. There were also numerous direct sales to customers of various other brands. All goods rose by 3-4 cents, with total market sales of over 20,000 bags, half of which were actual sales and the rest were speculative transactions. Wheat saw quiet supply and demand. Day factories occasionally purchased, with only 30-50 bags, and the price remained around 40 yuan. The miscellaneous grains market will be closed for the 7/7 anniversary, reopening on the 8th as usual.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Oil Cake Moves Without Smooth Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil cake sales moved but were not smooth. Hoarders were also mostly in a wait-and-see attitude. Transactions were mostly small and scattered, with the market presenting a flat and soft appearance. The market saw the sale of 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 100 loads of Da You factory soybean oil, 300 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, over 100 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans, 100 bags of Guid German soybeans, 300 bags of Qingkou soybeans, 3,000 pieces of Da You soybean cake, 1,400 pieces of Lu Zi soybean cake, 2,000 pieces of Shen Ji soybean cake, and 15,000 pieces for July delivery. Prices were all slightly lower (see market price section for details). 100 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Yantai yesterday, as well as 140 cans of butter, shipped from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Merchants Cautious on Both Sides; Spot Yarn Fluctuations Narrow; Guangdong Yarn Sales Also Appear Sluggish</h3>
<p>The yarn market has risen through consolidation, but actual trading has weakened slightly. Due to the shortage of 32-count single yarn and strong demand from Guangdong, market prices have risen daily, so sentiment is good. However, 20-count Double Horse brand single yarn is difficult to sell and the premiums are shortened, so fluctuations are narrower. As for the bankrupt yarn firms, there is still no satisfactory solution, so both sides are cautious and mostly adopt a wait-and-see attitude, waiting for the market to recover its vitality before regrouping and relaunching. Then the market will become prosperous. The high price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,616 yuan, and the low price was 1,595 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the weekend, the market was deserted.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with a positive sentiment. Everyone shouted to buy. The opening price was 1,602 yuan, rising directly to 1,615 yuan. Subsequently, because transactions for 20-count yarn from Guangdong were not smooth and there were no new buyers on the market, the situation loosened to 1,595 yuan. Unexpectedly, the spot price rose sharply, and sentiment revived. The final closing price was 1,615 yuan. According to the half-day trading statistics, 4,145 bales were traded, including 145 bales from the Hong Kong group and 4,000 bales of inter-firm transactions.</p>
<p>For the Golden Bell Horse brand yarn market, the opening was flat. It was subsequently reported that spot yarn transactions had declined. Until the close, it was reported that the price of gold had risen and the yarn price rose accordingly. As a result, July was flat, August was slightly higher by one yuan, and September was flat. According to the half-day trading statistics, 12,560 bales were traded, a decrease of 11,440 bales from the previous day. The half-day high, low, and closing prices are listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Rough Cotton Shows Improvement</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains firm, although trading has decreased somewhat. However, optimism persists because fine cotton raw materials are exceptionally scarce and expensive, making them difficult to move. Therefore, attention has been focused on Indian rough cotton and locally produced "fire engine" cotton. The large-scale purchasing of locally produced "fire engine" cotton by Japanese trading firms has contributed to the strength of rough cotton.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was closed yesterday.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to selling in Calcutta and profit-taking by bulls. It then stabilized as European exporters began buying. Finally, the market fell again due to further profit-taking and a climate report favorable to bears. Yesterday's closing prices fell by four to seven rupees.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the foreign cotton market was quiet but firm. Transactions were slightly rare due to frequent orders and an unstable source of supply. Yesterday, besides 500 bales of Brazilian cotton being transacted by foreign factories, only slightly more than 400 bales of Indian and Argentinian cotton were transacted by cotton firms.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Bleached Cloth Rises Sharply, Cotton Cloth Recovers in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market initially fell and then rose yesterday. The morning saw a release of floating stocks. Interest from local buyers was weak, creating a soft market. All cloth sales suffered declines, with white cotton, coarse and fine cloth, and twill falling by 2.5 cents. Some bleached and dyed cloth fell by 3.5 cents. However, the sharp rise of bleached cloth at noon triggered purchasing interest among speculators, causing holders to raise prices, leading to a rebound. Ultimately, there was little change compared to the previous day. Afternoon transactions were more active, totaling more than 300 pieces. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers, such as Huafeng Factory, purchased more than 200 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, khaki cloth, and other goods.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Initially weak, eventually rising. The closing price for fine cloth futures for the July term fell by 4 cents, while the October term rose by 7 cents. In the spot market, Saturday's trading was quiet. The closing price for Dragon Head fine cloth was also down 1 cent, at 48.8 yuan. Jean rose by 0.25 cents, to 1.6225 yuan. However, the market suddenly rose after the close due to rising margin calls, creating a strong bullish atmosphere. Transactions for Dragon Head fine cloth reached 49.6 yuan off the market, while Flying Fish fine cloth also saw transactions at 49 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: 100 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai today, and another 30 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Though Expensive, Woolen Fabrics Are Still Sought After</h3>
<p>(Spring Goods): These can still be sold because the new autumn season has not yet arrived. Most of the trading is still active, with many prices remaining firm and few falling.</p>
<p>(Summer Goods): Sales are excellent, although most of the peak sales period has passed. Therefore, trading is mostly small and fragmented. Paris flannel, "Fan Er Ding" feather yarn, linen, waxed thread, and "glue cloth" are selling particularly well. Prices are stable because the season is late.</p>
<p>(Autumn Goods): These have been selling the best recently. Wholesale dealers are busy with daily transactions. Sales of locally produced goods are much more active than imported goods. Riding breeches cloth, "Tuo Si Jin," yellow "Hua Te" cloth, and yellow serge are trading particularly well. Worsted suit fabrics priced around 40 yuan are the most popular.</p>
<p>(Winter Goods): These are selling even better than other woolen fabrics, and prices are rising alarmingly. The main reason is the perception that the current European war situation will make shipping difficult and supplies scarce. This leads to most people hoarding them, treating them like precious treasures. Despite the high prices, there are still many buyers, which is quite surprising.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Golden Lily Buds Go on Sale</h3>
<p>New golden lily buds from various producing areas have been harvested successively. It is reported that this year's output is fairly good and will be shipped to Shanghai. A small amount of Qingjiang goods arrived yesterday and went on sale immediately, priced at 250 yuan. The quality of the goods is just average.</p>
<h3>Hainan Dried Longan Soars</h3>
<p>Hainan dried longan prices are soaring because the goods will soon be released, pushing vendors to increase their prices. Cold-stored goods are now selling at 35 yuan, with 10 transactions. At the same time, the asking price has also risen to 50,000 yuan. Sales of large-sized dried longan have been rare recently, and the asking price has risen by over 20 yuan, seemingly set to rise rapidly.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Table Sugar Steady</h3>
<p>The sugar market was stable yesterday, with no significant changes. The exchange's price for Grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar for April arrival was 91.7 to 91.8 yuan, May arrival was 92.55 yuan, and June arrival was 92.7 yuan. Sugar arriving on the 26th of last month was priced at 93.7 to 95.6 yuan. Taikoo's "Car White" B brand was 109 yuan, and HX brand was 91.5 yuan, both clearly for immediate delivery. Dutch red KD brand was 74.2 yuan, and TMLNT brand was 72 yuan. Furthermore, Taikoo Sugar transported 4,100 bags of sugar from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Jellyfish Plentiful</h3>
<p>New jellyfish has arrived on the market. A batch was recently shipped, and this year's output is reported to be abundant. New jellyfish skin is selling for 140 yuan, while old stock requires 165 yuan. New jellyfish head is 110 yuan, and old stock is 125 yuan. Cold dishes are most suitable in this hot summer, so sales are very active.</p>
<h3>New Shrimp Offerings</h3>
<p>The first batch of new shrimp has arrived in small quantities and is of excellent quality. Ningbo shrimp is selling for 250 yuan, old stock for 200 yuan, and Zhoushan new shrimp for 395 yuan, a significant increase of 15 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Grade One Pepper is Extremely Popular</h3>
<p>The pepper market has recently stabilized. White pepper and large black pepper have not changed much, maintaining their previous prices. However, Grade One pepper is extremely popular, so the asking price yesterday was 150 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Quietly Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Coal dregs and various other coal types have returned to inactivity. Sales to customers remain sluggish. Besides a few scattered transactions, there have been no large-scale sales. Therefore, the market is flat, with no significant fluctuations. Yesterday, Indian coal dregs sold for 360 yuan per ton, Kaiping dregs for 348 yuan, and Grade Two dregs for 320 yuan. The above prices are for inter-dealer transactions, ex-warehouse delivery, delivered to customers with a small handling fee added.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Coke Squeezes In</h3>
<p>The price of coke varies greatly. High-end coke such as Kaiping coke and Zhongxing coke is priced above 1,000 yuan, which is alarming. Not much stock has arrived, and there are few wholesale transactions. It was recently reported that Taiwanese coke in straw bags has been loaded at a certain wharf in Hongkou, about 300 tons. The pieces are small and broken, and the quality is poor, so the price is relatively low. Lump coal is priced at 400 yuan per ton, ex-truck, and there are many interested buyers.</p>

The progress of public diplomacy between China and Britain has already merged into one, shoulder to shoulder in the battle for democracy.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador to Arrive in Shanghai the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. Guillaume, flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong. He originally intended to take a boat to Shanghai that day. However, he encountered a typhoon in Hong Kong, so the Ambassador had to stay for a while. According to relevant sources, the typhoon in Hong Kong and the surrounding area has now passed, so the Ambassador has already set off for Shanghai. He may arrive in Shanghai the day after tomorrow (the 8th).</p>
<h3>Customs-Guaranteed Internal Debt Principal and Interest: Current Method, Still Collected in Six Installments</h3>

(2) Various principal and interest coupons of Unification Bonds can be filled in on one form. If there are both Unification and Reconstruction Bonds, they should be filled in on two forms.

The garrison forces stationed in Shanghai and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps will also assist in the defense. As for unnecessary roads, bridges, lanes, and alleys, traffic will be restricted as needed. All armored vehicles, patrol teams, and male and female inspection teams will be dispatched to patrol in different areas and implement interception searches of hotel areas and designated mobile searches to prevent villains from hiding.</p>
<h3>Five Foreign Ships Imported Yesterday, Arriving with 160,000 Bags of Rice, Public Granary Rice Also Arrived via Grand Line Ship, Rice Market Still Controlled, Rice Prices Abnormal, Bean and Grain Warehouse Workers Requested Increase in Pay and Treatment, Walkout Due to Failure</h3>
<p>A large batch of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The French Far East Shipping Company's General Joffre mail ship arrived from Saigon with 39,000 bags and docked at the Shanghai Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. The French ship S.S.G.G.Varenne, managed by Wah Lun &amp; Co., arrived from Saigon with 34,000 bags and also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, docking at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong for unloading. In addition, the Thai-flagged S.S.Suiythai Nawa arrived from Rangoon with 47,000 bags yesterday afternoon and docked at the Shanghai Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. The import of this Thai ship is managed by the British Lishi Trading Company, and exports are still handled by Tongyi and Taishengli. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, loading 15,000 bags of rice from Hong Kong and docking at the Bund of the French Concession for unloading.</p>
<p>Public Granary Rice Similar to Hong Kong Rice</p>
<p>Wah Lun &amp; Co.'s Norwegian ship Grand Line arrived from Rangoon with 27,150 bags of public granary rice yesterday morning. It was originally scheduled to dock at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, but after arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, the company ordered it to change to the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. When reporters visited the ship, they saw that the quality of this public granary rice was similar to that of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Hong Kong rice, which is ordinary small-grain rice. According to the current market price, each stone is 122.5 yuan. However, the authorities decided to sell it to local households in Shanghai at a price of 110 yuan. The method is for the Public Granary Management Committee to sell it all to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and then the Shanghai Municipal Council will distribute it to various rice shops for sale. It is reported that the second and third batches of public granary rice will also be shipped from Rangoon to Shanghai. In total, 162,150 bags of foreign rice arrived yesterday.</p>
<p>Bean and Grain Warehouse Workers Walkout</p>
<p>The bean, rice, and grain warehouse workers in this city, because their monthly income is not enough to cover their expenses, jointly submitted a request to the industry association for increased wages and improved treatment, including: (1) Warehouse workers' salaries should be increased by seven times based on the original salaries in 1937. If the increase is less than 70 yuan, it should be calculated as 70 yuan. (2) Warehouse labor should be increased by two times. If the increase is less than four points, it should be calculated as four points. (3) A monthly allowance of five "dou" of white rice per person. (4) Five days of promotion pay should be issued per month. (5) Red river workers should be treated the same as employees, etc. These five items have been requested three times. The employer did not accept them because the conditions were too high. All warehouse workers, together with dockworkers, began a joint walkout on the previous day. However, the strike by the rice warehouse workers has a significant impact on people's livelihood. It is hoped that the employers in the industry will accept the demands put forward by the workers in order to maintain their livelihoods together.</p>
<p>Despite Large Rice Arrivals, Rice Prices Persist</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market situation was affected by numerous rumors, and hoarders became active again. However, speculative elements felt that a large amount of foreign rice was arriving, inventory was increasing rapidly, and the Shanghai Municipal Council's cheap rice continued to be handled continuously, causing actual sales to decrease greatly. They fabricated various rumors to induce the general public to buy in large quantities to achieve their goals. Therefore, the price of rice in each stall rose slightly yesterday. However, this phenomenon will only be a flash in the pan and cannot last. Since the facts are all there, how can it continue to be concealed? Therefore, rice prices must eventually fall.</p>
<p>Dispatch of Vehicles Transporting Rice and Grain</p>
<p>Rubber-wheeled small carts and trucks for transporting rice and grain have formed a cooperative society to adjust transportation work in the industry. Workers from the rice shops and shippers have joined and have been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Starting yesterday, all cargo matters at various wharves and foreign godowns will be handled by the cooperative society. In total, there are 350 small carts and 70 trucks dedicated to transportation. In order to reduce accidental losses in rice shops, in the future, if there are any accidents involving vehicles, all those transported by the cooperative society will be compensated at the original price. Therefore, the rice shop association has also issued a notice to all members to support it in order to reduce losses.</p>
<h3>Xiangshan Port Blockaded, Zhejiang Ships to Shanghai Anchored in Donggou</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, Xiangshan Port in eastern Zhejiang was recently blockaded by the Japanese fleet stationed in China, prohibiting all ships from entering and leaving. The ships entering and leaving the port are all sailing ships and fishing boats. Since the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang, fishing boats have had no fish to catch and have mostly been used to carry passengers, specializing in carrying passengers from places such as Shipu and Xiepu to Shanghai. Therefore, although the decision was blocked, besides these ships being unable to return to the port, there was no impact. Currently, passenger ships from Shipu and Xiepu to Shanghai are endless, sometimes several a day, all fully loaded with passengers. They are all coming to Shanghai to make a living due to hunger, and most of them are women and children. However, according to passengers, the wind and waves in the sea have been very strong recently, and the sailing ships are unbearable, so there are many dangers. Passengers taking these ships have endured hardships. All ships are anchored in Donggou, Pudong, after arriving in Shanghai, so that place has become a concentration of sailing ships coming to Shanghai from eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Staff, Ordered to Pledge Allegiance to Vichy, Otherwise Regarded as Traitors</h3>
<p>The French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, recently stated that he recently received an order from the Vichy government instructing all French staff serving in the Shanghai French Municipal Council to take an oath immediately to express their allegiance to the Vichy government, otherwise they would be discriminated against and regarded as traitors. However, the Free French in Shanghai expressed their opposition. The Shanghai French Municipal Council has received a notice from the French Ambassador, limited to reporting by the 10th of this month. It is reported that the Shanghai French Municipal Council has expressed its compliance. The oath papers can be collected and sent to the Embassy next week. However, the French Police Department is considering whether to comply with this order and has not yet announced it.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Social Affairs Office Planning to Set Up Industrial Training Night School, Designed Specifically for Adult Workers, Divided into Two Schools with a Fixed Number of 160 People</h3>
<p>On the 4th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial and Social Affairs Office held this year's industrial technology and safety training class at the Jindu Grand Theater on Avenue Foch, holding a ceremony to issue certificates to students. More than 1,000 guests attended, all from the machinery industry. A total of 190 trainees received certificates.</p>
<p>Technical Training</p>
<p>Ms. Xie De, Director of the Industrial and Social Affairs Office, presided over the meeting. During the meeting, it was announced that two technical training night schools are planned to be held in September, designed specifically for adult workers. Dr. Minsider, Chairman of the Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council, spoke at the meeting, followed by Mr. Jin Zhixuan, an engineer approved and registered by the Shanghai Municipal Council (i.e., the future teacher of the night school), who clarified the significance of the above plan. Mr. Shen Jichao, head of the technical training department of the office, explained the details of the night school.</p>
<p>Academic Content</p>
<p>The school is planned to be set up in the Shanghai Municipal Council school building, one at 25 Avenue Mabille in western Shanghai and one at Jingzhou Road in the eastern district. It is scheduled to have classes three times a week, two hours each time. The subjects taught include machinery workshop practice, workshop calculation, basic physics, machine drawing and design, mechanical installation, etc. The tuition fee is five yuan per semester. Those who have completed the limited period of apprenticeship and are able to pass the entrance examination can enroll. The entrance examination is scheduled to be held on August 18. Applicants must submit a written statement outlining their education and apprenticeship status to the Industrial and Social Affairs Office for review. In addition, the night school plans to enroll the 160 students with the best entrance examination results in the first year.</p>
<h3>Citibank's Beiping and Guangzhou Branches Close, Merged into Tianjin and Hong Kong Branches Respectively</h3>
<p>Due to the special commercial conditions in Beiping and Guangzhou, Citibank's Beiping and Guangzhou branches have decided to merge their businesses into the Tianjin and Hong Kong Citibank branches starting on July 31 and August 31 of this year, respectively. From the above-mentioned merger dates, all inquiries regarding the Beiping and Guangzhou branches should be contacted to the Tianjin and Hong Kong branches.</p>
<h3>Harmonious Labor-Management Relations in Tea Shops, Agreement Signed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The labor-management dispute in more than 500 tea shops in the city has been resolved satisfactorily after open consultations by representatives from both sides. The employer has agreed not to dismiss employees without cause, and 28% of the annual surplus of each shop will be used for profit-sharing. Employees' salaries are divided into nine levels, with the lowest increased to 24 yuan and the highest increased to 110 yuan. Yesterday, the employer sent Zhen Huan and the labor sent Jiang Jingbo as representatives of both parties to officially sign and take effect. Therefore, the labor-management dispute in the industry has now been resolved satisfactorily. It is reported that employees of each shop are satisfied with the agreement.</p>

<h3>National Liberation War Must Have All-People Service, Continental Daily Calls for Enforcement of Military Service Law, Taking Chairman Chiang as a Model</h3>
<p>Recently, the Military Affairs Commission launched a campaign for the sons of gentry and civil servants to join the army. On the 2nd, Chairman Chiang issued a telegram ordering all localities to comply. The English-language Continental Daily in this city commented on this yesterday, stating that the payment of substitutes for military service was a phenomenon in the American Civil War. At that time, the bourgeoisie was unwilling to perform military service and abandoned their national obligations.</p>
<p>Bourgeoisie to Enforce Together</p>
<p>Now China's military service law stipulates that anyone who reaches the age of enlistment must serve the country. However, in fact, this regulation has not been enforced by the bourgeoisie. This is the weakness of China's social system. China is carrying out a national liberation war for freedom and should not rely solely on the bloodshed and sweat of the Chinese working masses.</p>
<p>Feudal Concepts Should Not Exist</p>
<p>Now that they have served the most in this great struggle compared to other classes, if China's war in the future relies solely on them, then their lofty consciousness will be deeply unhappy because the sons of the bourgeoisie can be exempted from military service. The feudal concept of Chinese society is deeply ingrained, so some noble children can be exempted from military service, not because they are willing to do so, but because their families prevent them from fulfilling their national duties.</p>
<p>Urgent Need for Sacrificial Spirit</p>
<p>Although their parents are unwilling to sacrifice their children for the country, unless their parents do not know the pain of national subjugation, we must understand the importance of this sacrifice for the country. China needs the entire nation to have a sacrificial spirit, which is more urgent than any other country. China needs every people to have the lofty will and personality like Chairman Chiang to solve the various difficulties of the country. China must make the military service law enforceable everywhere, regardless of the poverty or wealth of the classes, and then China will forever become a great nation, striving to protect the well-being of all mankind.</p>
<h3>Son of a Numerologist Kidnapped, Rescued Yesterday, Ransom Note Demands 150,000 Yuan, Three Bandits Captured During Yesterday's Negotiations</h3>
<p>Zhang Xietang's numerology hall, located at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Villemon in the French Concession, has a good business, which has been coveted by kidnappers. At 4:00 p.m. on the 1st of this month, Zhang's son, Zhang Daqing, who was only eight years old, was playing in the Shangde Lane nearby.</p>
<p>Suddenly Reported Missing</p>
<p>After searching everywhere to no avail, Zhang reported the disappearance of the child to the French police. Several days passed without any news. Yesterday, Zhang suddenly received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 150,000 yuan and specifying that someone should be sent to Zhaofeng Garden in western Shanghai at 7:00 p.m. that afternoon to negotiate.</p>
<p>Proceed to Negotiate</p>
<p>Zhang sent the letter to the French police, and the head of the police instructed several detectives from the criminal department to go in disguise, together with police officers from the Special Police Department, and arrived on time, arresting two bandits negotiating on the spot and confiscating a live handgun, and confessing the location of the hostage.</p>
<p>Hiding Place</p>
<p>Immediately rushed to the address and rescued the little hostage Zhang Daqing on the spot, and continued to capture two bandits guarding him, and took them back to the French police for investigation. As for the little hostage Zhang Daqing, he was immediately escorted back to his residence.</p>
<h3>Woman Uses Fake Ornaments to Deceive and Exchange for Real Goods, Many Jewelers Affected, Arrested and Detained Once Discovered</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhang, an Anhui woman, is 27 years old. Her husband, Zhang, is currently in the army. Zhang is an old woman, dressed in modern style. In the past one or two months, she has gone to more than ten stores, including Tianchang Jewelry Store at 578 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, Zhenchang Diamond Shop on the same road, and Lianfa Secondhand Store on Avenue Foch, on the pretext of buying jewelry and secretly exchanged fake ones for real ones. The value of the deceived items reached tens of thousands of yuan. The day before yesterday, Zhang went to China Jewelry Store, opened by Cai Shuren at 339 Avenue Foch, and used her old trick to exchange fake ones for real ones. She was discovered by the store clerk, who obtained evidence of the stolen goods and called the police to arrest her and take her to the police station. After interrogation, Zhang's previous scams were revealed, and the owners of the affected stores were summoned to the case for identification. The head of the police ordered Zhang to be detained, pending further investigation and recovery of the stolen goods before further verification.</p>
<h3>Gang Constable Kills Three in a Case Stemming from Romantic Jealousy: Encounter at a Bookstore Leads to a Love Triangle and a Gruesome Murder-Suicide</h3>
<p>The incident of a Huabao (Chinese Constable) surnamed Hua absconding from his post and killing three people the day before yesterday (the 4th), followed by his suicide out of fear of punishment, is truly a bizarre and tragic occurrence in the city's assassination cases of recent years. It is understood that this bloody case originated from a love quadrangle, with the protagonist Wang Lijuan (aka Mrs. Sun Wang) maintaining relationships with Qin Li and Constable Hua despite being married to Sun Jinyuan. This led to the unfortunate incident. Currently, only Wang Lijuan remains hospitalized for treatment; the other three have died one after another. The details will be further chronicled below.</p>
<p>**Father Assists Daughter in Hospitality at the Huyuan Bookstore**</p>
<p>Wang A'gen, a native of Changshu, operates the Huyuan Bookstore at 190 Kuling Road. His daughter, Lijuan, assists her father in hosting the audience. She developed romantic relationships with three customers of the bookstore: Sun Jinyuan, Constable Hua (from Zhenjiang, 28 years old, residing at Lane 56, No. 3 Meibage Road), and Qin Li, a student at Zhijiang University. Ultimately, Sun emerged victorious, and on January 1st of last year, they officially married at the Yingbinlou Restaurant on Simalu (the 4th Avenue). They rented a small room in the kitchen area at Lane 38, No. 18 Meibage Road. Wang still frequented the Huyuan Bookstore, and Constable Hua and student Qin Li also used listening to the storytelling as an excuse to meet with Wang, as in the past. Sun Jinyuan was truly a thorn in the side of Qin and Hua.</p>
<p>**Smiling and Chatting, a Sudden Murderous Impulse Arises**</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses from nearby residents, Constable Hua was stationed at the intersection of Meibage Road and Burke Road every morning. Recently, he had been transferred to the intersection of Meibage Road and Jing'an Temple Road. On the day of the incident, around 11:00 AM, Qin Li and the constable were seen whispering to each other for a long time. Around 11:30 AM, the two went together to Sun Jinyuan's house, chatting and laughing along the way. Unexpectedly, as soon as they arrived in front of Sun's house, Hua suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired a shot at Qin's head. Blood splattered everywhere, and Qin fell to the ground in front of the house. Hua then carried the gun into the kitchen, where Sun was still asleep. He fired three shots at him and immediately turned around and fled, hoping to escape. However, as soon as he reached the entrance of the lane, Sun's wife, Wang Lijuan, returned from buying groceries. Hua raised his gun and fired two shots at her face and abdomen. At this point, only one bullet remained in Hua's pistol. He aimed it at his head, fired, and fell to the ground next to Wang.</p>
<p>**Wang's Life is Still in Danger Despite Hospitalization**</p>
<p>Hua and Sun died from their severe injuries upon arrival at the hospital. Qin also died from his injuries at 2:00 PM that afternoon. Wang Lijuan's injuries were relatively minor; the shot to her face was not a major issue. However, the bullet in her abdomen had not passed through. Although the bullet was surgically removed at Baolong Hospital yesterday, she lost too much blood, and her life is still in danger. According to reports, there were no prior quarrels or altercations before the incident. Hua's sudden action surprised all the residents in the lane. According to a Chinese constable who was Hua's colleague, this incident was generally believed to be a result of jealousy. It was said that Qin Li encouraged Hua to kill Sun, but Hua himself, for some unknown reason, changed his mind and decided to commit suicide after killing Wang.</p>
<h3>Two Public Buses Vandalized Yesterday, Incidents Occurred on Yuyuan Road</h3>
<p>A public bus numbered 15167 of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, running on Route 9, was carrying passengers from Jing'an Temple westward yesterday around 11:00 AM. When it reached a certain point on Yuyuan Road, more than a dozen men lying in wait by the roadside, each wielding wooden sticks and other weapons, blocked the way. They forced the passengers, ticket seller, and driver off the bus and proceeded to smash all the windows. They then scattered. Afterward, the driver and others reported the incident to the company. Around 12:00 PM, another bus, numbered 15104, on the same route was also ambushed and vandalized on the same road.</p>
<h3>Shi Zhenghong's Fan Calligraphy Collaboration with Painter Hu Yaguang</h3>
<p>Shi Zhenghong from Yun Jian has been renowned in literary circles for his poetry and prose for the past twenty years. It was only recently discovered that his calligraphy is also exquisite. Shi himself claims that his poetry surpasses his prose, and his calligraphy surpasses his poetry. However, he is usually busy with teaching duties and has no time to hold a brush. Taking advantage of this vacation, he has collaborated with the famous West Lake painter Hu Yaguang on one hundred painted fans. Each fan is modestly priced at ten yuan. Since the news spread, requests have poured in, and the quota will soon be filled. No further requests will be accepted. Submissions can be made to Mr. Tan at the dispatch department of Shen Bao Newspaper Office, and Da Jing Middle School in Qingyuan Li, Henan Road, Beijing Road. The image on the left is a recent running script fan page by Shi.</p>
<h3>Friends Turn Foes Over Debt: Gunfight Leaves Both Injured, Both Had Guns and Refused to Yield, Gunshot Wounds to Arms and Chest, Fortunately Not Serious</h3>
<p>A shooting occurred at the Yuelai Apartment in Run Kang New Village, Jing'an Temple Road, in the Public Concession at 5:40 PM yesterday. As a result, both parties were injured, fortunately, only slightly. The details are chronicled below.</p>
<p>**Originally Good Friends**</p>
<p>In Room 293 of the Yuelai Apartment in Run Kang New Village, Lane 591 Jing'an Temple Road, resided Wu Heyue, 26 years old, from Wuxi, who lived at 579 Wuding Road. He worked at the Zhaochang Iron Factory. He had a friend named Wang Zhentingzhu, 37 years old, residing at 49 Avenue Muntigny in the French Concession. They were close friends, like brothers.</p>
<p>**Friends Turn Foes Over Debt**</p>
<p>Wang, due to unemployment, felt economically strained. He borrowed 600 national currency from Wu. Last month, when Wu demanded repayment, Wang issued a bad check from the China Industrial Bank as a temporary measure. Wu was unable to cash the check upon maturity and confronted Wang, who avoided meeting him. At 9:40 PM yesterday, Wu learned that Wang was at the above location and drove there.</p>
<p>**Gunfight Ensues**</p>
<p>Wu went to Room 293 of the apartment to confront Wang. They disagreed and resorted to violence. Both sides produced their own guns and exchanged gunfire. A bullet hit Wu's right arm, grazed his chest, and penetrated his left elbow. Wang was also hit in the right leg, bleeding profusely. Fortunately, none of the injuries were serious. Afterward, the apartment reported the incident to the Chengdu Road Police Station.

Ambulances were quickly summoned to take the two injured men to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Hu Qingchen, Robbery of Chinese Constable's Gun, Notorious Bandit Fan Jinbiao Yesterday Escorted to Court for Questioning, Fan Pleads Guilty to Both Cases</h3>
<p>Chinese and foreign detectives from the Xinzha Police Station in the Public Concession previously apprehended a notorious bandit named Fan Jinbiao from Jiangbei. He was transferred to the Chief Inspector's Office for investigation. As a result of the investigation, Fan confessed to committing a kidnapping and a robbery. (1) Hu Qingchen, manager of the Shanghai Silver Company at 327 Jiangxi Road, resided at Lane 608, No. 60 Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>**Wealthy Family**</p>
<p>His male servant, Zhu Yizhong, had been in contact with the bandit gang. Zhu initiated the plot and gathered several kidnappers. On November 23rd of last year, at 9:00 AM, they went to Hu's residence and kidnapped him. After several negotiations, Hu was released for a ransom of 120,000 yuan. Fan also participated in this case. (2) On October 22nd of last year, at 8:20 AM, Fan and his accomplices passed by a small hotel at 408 Yidingpan Road and saw two Chinese constables from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, No. 1305 and No. 1320.</p>
<p>**Having a Snack Inside**</p>
<p>They entered the hotel and, through intimidation, robbed the two Chinese constables of their two official pistols and 24 bullets. Yesterday morning, this case was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the plaintiff in the kidnapping case, Hu Qingchen, claimed to have left Shanghai and was therefore unable to be summoned to court. When questioned, Fan confessed to the crimes. Judge Chuan Lin reviewed the confession and ordered a postponement for further questioning in one week.</p>
<h3>Venerable Rongzeng Lama Goes to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Tibetan Tantric Vajra Master Rongzeng Khenpo, by order of the former Panchen Lama and at the invitation of Duan Zhichuan, Qu Wenliu, and others, has been promoting Tibetan Buddhism and translating scriptures in Shanghai, remaining aloof from worldly affairs. Recently, disciples of Tantric Buddhism in Hong Kong have repeatedly requested him to travel south to offer guidance and preside over Dharma assemblies and consecration ceremonies for bronze Buddha statues. He has been delaying his departure. However, due to the depressing climate in Shanghai and to avoid the noise and dust, as well as to comply with the request of his Hong Kong disciples, he left for Hong Kong the day before yesterday. It is expected that he will be delayed there for a considerable period of time.</p>

<h3>Never Cease Studying</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlv</p>
<p>Dear children! Have you heard the story of "The Tortoise and the Hare"? The simple story is this: One day, the tortoise and the hare had a race. Although the tortoise walked slowly, it climbed diligently step by step, never giving up. The hare ran very fast at first, but it fell asleep halfway, ending up behind the tortoise.</p>
<p>Our pursuit of knowledge is like a race; we cannot stop for even a moment. If there is any interruption, not only will our studies not progress, but we will also regress due to forgetting. As the ancients said, "Studying is like sailing against the current; if you do not advance, you will fall behind." This is truly a profound saying.</p>
<p>Now that summer vacation has begun, children, you must feel very happy to be freed from the strict school life, right? However, the pursuit of knowledge cannot be interrupted. The weather is very hot during the summer vacation, and it is not advisable to use too much brainpower, but naturally, we should not let the time go to waste. In the morning, the weather is relatively cool, which is the perfect time to study. In addition to reviewing lessons, reading some valuable books and newspapers can increase your knowledge. Also, writing and keeping a diary should not be missed for a single day. The vacation assignments prescribed by the school should be done daily. If you feel too lonely working alone, then invite a few like-minded friends to organize a "Summer Reading Group" to learn from and encourage each other. The benefits you gain will naturally be many!</p>
<p>Children! I hope that during this summer vacation, you will not be intimidated by the heat, nor tempted by entertainment, but will still work hard to pursue knowledge, not interrupt it even slightly, and continue to make progress!</p>
<h3>Life is a Road</h3>
<p>— Xin Gao</p>
<p>It was a summer afternoon. After Joan and Wayne finished eating, they had nothing to do, so they planned to go play in the nearby forest. It was a very large forest, with tall trees, red flowers, and green grass. There were also little birds flying around, singing happy songs. The beautiful scenery captivated these two children. Not until the stars appeared in the sky did they realize that it was getting late and that it was time to go home. But they had long forgotten the road they had taken to get in.</p>
<p>"Let's hurry up and run. Mom must be anxiously waiting at home!" Wayne said to Joan.</p>
<p>"But where's the road? This place is so big, there are so many small paths. Which path should we take to get out?" Joan was at a loss.</p>
<p>They could only grope around in the dark, trying each path, but all were failures. They were still in the forest, no matter where they went. There was one path that they wholeheartedly believed could lead them out, but although it led them out of the forest, a large swamp blocked their way.</p>
<p>Later, their mom ran out and brought them out. "Children, I've been waiting for you for so long!" she said to them. "The so-called life is also like this. No matter where you go, you should always carry a guide. Then you won't get lost. There are often many seemingly spacious roads in the world that will give you all sorts of fascinating pleasures, but they are actually dead ends that lead to corruption."</p>
<p>Children, what is the guide for life? Isn't it to read more and study more?</p>
<h3>Top Student</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Praised by neighbors, delighted by parents, but absolutely must not be complacent.</p>
<p>When schools hold summer vacation closing ceremonies, what children are eager to know and anticipate is their overall average grade and their ranking on the list. This is because it's a thermometer of their usual hard work and a comprehensive test of their academic performance.</p>
<p>My son, Xixian, has been studying at the private Ziqiang Elementary School for years. He is currently in the fifth grade, class A, and will be entering the sixth grade next semester. He usually relies on his natural intelligence and is not willing to study diligently. I am deeply concerned that he is too clever for his own good at such a young age (he is twelve years old this year and lost a year of schooling during the Shanghai battle). Therefore, we constantly use both kindness and strictness to supervise him, urging him to learn and never be lazy. He is obedient and focused, so in every school exam, he is ranked second or third, never falling behind. This time, he again achieved "Five As" and "First Place," receiving a "scholarship voucher" from Mr. Shen Erke, the principal of Ziqiang School. The voucher stated: (1) This voucher is only awarded to the top three students in each grade. (2) Holders of this voucher can attend this school's current summer school session, exempt from tuition and book fees. (3) This voucher cannot be used as a substitute. (4) If the holder does not attend summer school, it cannot be used for other purposes, etc. We decided to have him attend summer school for further studies. He is temporarily praised by neighbors and delighted by us, but as parents, we must warn him against complacency. He must strive harder, be more self-motivated, and work hard in his studies. We hope that children who achieve "First Place" will also avoid "complacency."</p>
<h3>The World's First Mosquito Eradication Campaign</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhaolin</p>
<p>Dear children, you probably all know about world geography. In the Americas, there is the Panama Canal, connecting the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean, which can be said to be the largest canal in the world today.</p>
<p>This canal was originally managed by a Frenchman named Li Sai Pu. Because the Panama area had a very severe yellow fever, killing tens of thousands of workers every year, everyone was afraid of dying and unwilling to work. Li Sai Pu had no choice but to stop the canal construction.</p>
<p>Later, an American doctor stationed in Cuba, named Dr. Gorgas, studied the source of yellow fever and learned that it was transmitted by mosquitoes native to Central America. The mosquito sucks the blood of a person with yellow fever, and the germs follow the blood sucked, mixing into the mosquito's mouth. When it bites a healthy person, it mixes the germs into that person's blood, and thus yellow fever is transmitted to that person. In 1904, Dr. Gorgas went to the canal area and distributed many technical staff to carry out mosquito eradication work in the two major areas from the Panama Canal to Colón. He cleaned ditches, filled small puddles and ponds, sprayed kerosene inside, covered drinking water, and completely isolated and treated people who had already contracted yellow fever to prevent mosquitoes from sucking the germs again. In places with more mosquitoes, sulfur was burned to fumigate and kill them...etc. After exactly one year, by December 1905, the mosquitoes were eradicated.</p>
<p>This campaign consumed a total of 200,000 pounds of insecticide and 400,000 pounds of sulfur, which can truly be regarded as the world's first large-scale mosquito eradication campaign!</p>
<p>After the mosquitoes were eradicated, yellow fever no longer occurred, and the Americans began to dig through the Panama Canal.</p>
<h3>The Frog's Tongue</h3>
<p>— Guan Qun</p>
<p>Hui'er came back from school and saw a frog on the bank of a field, sticking out its tongue to catch small insects. He squatted down, caught the frog, and put it in his clothes.</p>
<p>When Hui'er returned home, he took the frog out and looked at it carefully. After a while, he opened its mouth to look at its tongue, but its tongue suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>Hui'er felt very strange and asked his sister, "Where did the frog's tongue go?" His sister said, "I think frogs probably don't have tongues." Hui'er quickly said, "When I didn't catch it, I clearly saw it sticking out its tongue to catch small insects. How can you say it doesn't have a tongue?" His sister said, "Then, I don't know. Go ask Dad."</p>
<p>Hui'er ran to ask his father. His father said, "Why did you think of asking me this?" Hui'er said, "When I didn't catch it, I saw it sticking out its tongue to catch small insects. Now, when I open its mouth to look at its tongue, the tongue suddenly disappears. Isn't this a strange thing? So I asked my sister, and she didn't know, so I came to ask you!" His father said, "You are really observant, and I am very happy for you! Do you want to understand the structure of a frog's tongue? Wait a moment! I will get a book about frogs to show you." Hui'er was very happy to hear his father praise him, and his interest in studying the frog's tongue became even stronger.</p>
<p>After a while, his father brought a book and pointed to the section about frogs, saying to Hui'er, "Because its tongue root is connected to the lower jaw, and the tip of its tongue faces inward, you can't see the tongue when you open its mouth." Hui'er said, "Dad! What you said is wrong. You said the tip of its tongue faces inward, so how can the tip of its tongue extend outside the mouth?" His father smiled and said, "Precisely because the tip of its tongue faces inward, it can be turned outward and extended." Hui'er said, "Then, how can it catch the flying insects firmly?" His father said, "Because there is a layer of mucus on its tongue. When mosquitoes or moths fly by, it can stick them with a roll of its tongue and swallow them into its stomach." Hui'er understood and said, "Oh! That's how it is."</p>

<h3>What word should be filled in?</h3>
<p>— Fei Ming</p>
<p>The continuous heavy rains of the past few days made Min'er, who loves to play, impatient and restless, and he was bored at home all day long. One day, he received a letter, and when he opened it, it turned out to be from his good friend Cong'er. The letter taught him a kind of game that made him spend the day happily. The letter was written like this:</p>
<p>Dear Brother Min'er:</p>
<p>The continuous rain is really annoying, and I don't know how to pass the time. Recently, I finally came up with a kind of word game. I know you must be very bored too, so I'll copy it below for you to relieve your boredom. The method is to fill in a word in the middle of the seven groups of characters below, so that the group of characters can form a word above, below, left, and right. The seven groups of characters are:</p>
<p>Wishing you relief from your boredom,</p>
<p>Your brother, Cong'er</p>
<p>Impatient Min'er thought for a long time, but couldn't figure out what word should be filled in to succeed. The more anxious he got, the worse it became, and he was like an ant on a hot pot, running around in the house. Children! Please fill in the words for him! (Don't be impatient)</p>
<p>(1) The space in the middle should be filled with the character "日" (sun). (2) The space in the middle should be filled with the character "立" (stand).

<h3>Norma Shearer Hates Solitary Life</h3>
<p>— Qing Hui</p>
<p>Speaking of Norma Shearer, everyone knows that she is the widow of former MGM manager Irving Thalberg. They married in 1928 and had a son and a daughter. But good times didn't last long. Before long, Thalberg abandoned his beautiful wife and passed away, and this unparalleled artist fell into the abyss of darkness. This sudden trauma and the sorrow of death forced her to temporarily leave the screen until 1938, when she returned to the silver screen, awakening her black and gray dreams. Recently, she met George Raft, and the extinguished fire of love rekindled. Is she really going to remarry? Indeed, here is her confession as proof:</p>
<p>"What surprises me the most is that people seem to care about me. Now I have a chance to pour out all the sorrows hidden in my heart," said Norma.</p>
<p>"The first thing I should declare is that I think solitary life is wrong, fundamentally wrong, and harmful to health, especially for someone in my profession. When filming, at home, everywhere, I am alone, so my personality gradually becomes special, very selfish and strange. Recently, I feel that I am extremely easy to get angry. When I can't find hand sanitizer or the shoes I usually wear, I scold people, and even feel that the world is cold and not surrounded by sunshine. Only in all dark places does my insignificant self exist." Norma seemed very sad and paused for a long time before continuing:</p>
<p>"In my house, I can eat whatever I want, and no one interferes or criticizes me. I can go out whenever I want, and I can go home whenever I want, and I never have to say 'Goodbye!' or have anyone tell me to come back early. If I lie in bed and read novels all night without sleeping, no one will stop me or tell me that I shouldn't. Really! I am too free. But, God! I hate myself. Why do I have to live alone and lonely in this vast universe?"</p>
<p>"Also, many reports in newspapers and magazines have reported about my friendship with Raft. I also admit that this is not entirely false. My children respect him, and we do have a good friendship, but I still need to consider marriage carefully. Of course, I am willing to remarry, because of the children and for my own sake, I do need a husband to help and comfort me again. I believe a widow should remarry, especially a passionate woman."</p>
<p>As she spoke, her pair of black eyes sparkled as if she were about to cry. That delicate face, jet-black hair, and bright red lips, paired with black velvet trousers and a loose short jacket in alternating golden yellow and tender green colors, were indeed beautiful and charming. You might ask, "Why would such a lovely woman live a solitary life?"</p>
<h3>Evaluation of "Long, Long Ago"</h3>
<p>— Sha Fei</p>
<p>I have read Alexandre Dumas fils' "La Dame aux Camélias" more than ten times, and each time it brings me to tears. I let emotion carve through pieces of wounds. This is the depth to which the article moves people.</p>
<p>"Long, Long Ago" is adapted from the story of "La Dame aux Camélias." Some of the plots inside are roughly the same. The only differences are that one has a Western background and the other has local scenery. Also, in terms of consciousness, one is a powerful satire against feudalism, and the other instills a correct sense of patriotism.</p>
<p>The entire play has five acts. The first two acts are relatively calm and dull, and it seems that the actors only have dead bodies as a backdrop, without the expression of living souls. From the third act onwards, it is directly surrounded by a tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>Vera plays the Camellia Lady, and Qin Wei plays Hu Zhisheng. Their tit-for-tat confrontation in the third act is one of the best scenes in the entire play. Hu Zhisheng forced her sentence by sentence to leave his son, to make her know that the greatest love does not belong to private possession, and to encourage or rather, to agitate Hu Yamin to serve the country. In short, it is to make her bravely sacrifice everything. The external and internal pain conveyed by the Camellia Lady during this period concerns the lifeblood of the entire play; Vera plays it very well, her face changes constantly, her tone changes from time to time, and every move can grasp the audience's heart.</p>
<p>In the fourth act, the Camellia Lady and Hu Yamin have a reunion, and Jin Baiwan comes with them. Thus began the dueling dialogue.</p>
<p>Qiao Qi, who plays Hu Yamin, ridiculed Jin Baiwan (played by Shao Fan) on the one hand, and scolded the Camellia Lady on the other, with every word biting and every sentence powerful. It is a pity that Shao Fan's Jin Baiwan's expression and movements are a bit stiff, and it seems that it is not stimulating enough.</p>
<p>The fifth act is "Death Separation."</p>
<p>The Camellia Lady's words to Hu Yamin on her deathbed were: "I hope you will cherish yourself for the country!" In terms of actors, in addition to these important roles, others such as Lu Shan's Mrs. Lü, Sun Qi Ying's Fan Shaofu, Li Yi's Cheng Guoqing, Xia Wang's Qian Ailan, Bi Sheng's Guo Shidong, Qiu Zhi's Tang Rensui, and Lin Na's Lingli, can all be competent.</p>

<p>Chapter 12 As Expected, Ning Wu Can't Be Helped</p>
<p>Zhou Yuji saw that the morale was still good and felt a little relieved, so he went to inspect the city walls. He ordered the soldiers to repair the loopholes in several places and guard them carefully. There were several earthen cannons on the pass. Zhou Yuji selected more than a dozen gunners, prepared ammunition, so that they could bombard the bandits in an emergency. The next day, the vanguard of the rebels arrived. Two bandit generals challenged the defenders at the pass. Zhou Yuji wanted to meet the enemy himself, but Wang Weiguo was willing to do it for him. Zhou Yuji then ordered Xu Jing to guard the formation and dispatched four hundred men to kill out of the pass. Wang Weiguo wielded two copper hammers, riding a tall horse, and fought with the two bandits. Before long, one hammer hit a bandit's head, and his brains burst and he died. A bandit turned his horse to escape, but Wang Weiguo chased after him quickly, and another hammer swept across, hitting the bandit general's back, and he fell off his horse. Wang Weiguo killed two bandits in a row, and chased after them on horseback. Xu Jing, fearing that he would lose, also killed after him. The bandit soldiers were defeated and fled. The two men withdrew their troops into the city, and Zhou Yuji offered wine to comfort them. He still ordered his subordinates to guard the pass strictly, and a large force of rebels would surely arrive. Sure enough, when the setting sun hung over the mountains, the dust outside the pass covered the sky, and the sound of the Jia horn filled the ears. Li Zicheng had led a large force of rebels to attack Ningwu Pass. They set up five large camps in a plum blossom formation under the pass, and many small camps were set up on both sides. Looking over, the flags fluttered in the wind, circling like earthworms, filled with murderous intent, and the momentum was vast. But in the blink of an eye, it was evening, and there was no sign of the rebels attacking. Zhou Yuji, having learned a lesson in Daizhou, ordered his subordinates to be careful and prepared. He himself did not rest for a moment on the city wall. The rebel army was quiet and motionless. The next morning, at dawn, the shouts outside the pass shook the sky, and people gathered like ants. The rebels attacked Ningwu Pass in one go, shooting rockets into the city. In an instant, the dilapidated building caught fire and burned. Zhou Yuji hurriedly directed the soldiers to extinguish the fire as soon as possible. He then ordered the gunners to fire all the earthen cannons at once. The sound of the cannons was deafening, hitting down on the pass. Sparks exploded, and smoke filled the air. Countless rebels died in the artillery fire, and the offensive was greatly reduced.
