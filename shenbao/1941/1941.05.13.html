<h3>蘇俄動靜之謎</h3>
<p>蘇俄在歐戰爆發之後，即被世人重視爲國際舉足重輕的重鎭；最近數日，似乎更復被視爲即將演出於國際舞臺的主角。事實上，除了它與日本簽訂了中立條的，將所標榜的和平政策，所把握的中立態度，再在這一局部由這一條的加以强調；除了公表政令，禁止他國軍火過境，將多年來夙由政府嚴格統制了的運輸交通，再以文字正式說明了原則與例外；除了史丹林氏担任人民委員會主席，將「太上元首」亦即事實的主宰者，由此而眞面目的躬臨大位，親掌政權；凡此種種，祇使原來的現象與實質，更表面化了些；此外更無何種新事實，表示何種新的動嚮，新的準備，或何種新的策略與行動。因此而遽視爲「即將演出」，未免言之過早，至少在目前是證據不足。然而國際電訊則幾乎同時的先後傳稱蘇俄即將助德參戰，又稱蘇德交戰期不在遠。若此交流，自未能相得益彰：若此矛盾，亦未能互為印證；却也不許以其矛盾之交流而輕輕的抹煞之爲正負相消等於零。因為國際局勢的錯綜消長，紛擾的蔓延擴大，終有客觀的因素，使這重鎭不能長居局外，終於演出。</p>
<p>注意世變，注意蘇俄，無不渴望獲知未來的究竟；但有關蘇俄的一切未來，即使試作肯定的論斷，亦未可深信論斷的準確。所可推論者，百說雜陳，衆相迷離，或則可能，或則兩可而不同其分量，或則不可能；即此區別，雖仍無法獲致肯定而確切的結論，然不失爲研討結論的資料。即如日前重慶電訉，日機襲渝時，散發傳單，以日本外務大臣松岡離莫斯科時，與蘇俄要人擁吻作別為資料，明示蘇俄旣親呢日本而暗示蘇俄的讐視中國。此種宣傳方法是吾有所預期的離間挑撥之功效，是吾幼稚至可發一笑，姑勿評述；然日方所望的蘇俄親日讐華，乃爲事實所不可能。蓋蘇俄的一切取捨之決定，當然以蘇俄的利害爲標準，蘇俄疆域跨歐亞兩大洲，同樣的不願割棄，同樣的深惡威脅。他在東方的亞洲部分，自始迄今，唯一的威脅來自日本；現在旣因中國的長期作戰而削弱了日方所得加諸蘇俄的威脅，因中國的繼續作戰而必繼續削弱日方的威脅，故希望蘇俄讐視中國，事屬不可能。對於日本，雖目覩其力量寖衰，與蘇俄不復工力悉敵的對立；然在未能證實日方威脅完全消失之前，決不疎懈其戒備；故减少東方駐軍而移調他處之說必不憚煩勞的吾認，故怎樣的與日親呢爲不可能。與日簽訂中立條的，祇夠說明蘇日間對立狀態的暫時緩和，亦得說明目前的蘇俄感覺西方威脅甚於東方，甚或感覺對歐洲方面幾乎不克保持其中立。</p>
<p>以蘇俄主要臟腑之在於歐洲部份，則偏重於歐洲方面的掩護，亦自在情理之中。若超越掩護的性質而積極赴戰，則黨德黨英，皆非必不可能。大體比較：論物資，則大不列顛漫藏最富，自近東乃至印度，蘇俄尤處於近水樓臺，故黨德則分肥較肥。論策略，蘇俄稱熊而似象，德似虎，英是鯨；與虎相鬥於大陸，或自傷：若自陸上與虎為伍而征略侵呑，鯨將徒喚奈何；故黨德則成本較輕。總之，蘇俄黨德敵英的可能性之存在，不容否定。論信仰，資本主義與共產主義誠相枘鑿，共產主義與納粹主義尤相水火；兩者不但距離不同，共產與納粹幾於先天的不共戴天，而英蘇不是不容共存。論禍害，德國黷武，英國民治；德國正圖稱覇，英國僅不安於他國稱覇；黷武圖覇於同一大陸之上，當然予人以更嚴重的威脅。論利益衝突，英蘇之間自有其久已隱然對立的利害關係，却無新爭執；若在多腦河流域，在巴爾幹半島，在近東包圍着土耳其的叙利亞與伊拉克，則近頃德國每一舉動，無不使蘇聯感覺創痛。總之，蘇俄黨英敵德，具有較多理由，更不容否定其可能。兩事的比較，我們比較的不以為蘇俄竟無所疑忌於養虎貽患而作有利於德國的軍事行動。怎樣纔能對英對德，不友不敵，至少亦知其雖有敵意而不致正面作戰，有所作為於夾縫之中，竟得予求予取，一若去年行之於北歐羣小者，再來一次，再得大獲，這不是蘇俄所打算的嗎？但是近東不比北歐，根本懷疑其間有無為蘇俄而設之夾縫，無夾縫則無法擺脫英德分野而自張一軍。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談　（五四）　美國工潮的平息</h3>
<p>今春美國各大工業區的工潮，此伏彼起，遷延兩月以上，牽涉工人數萬，國防工業各工廠，如福特汽車公司伯利恒鋼鐵公司，平狄克斯航空用具公司，洛杉磯造船廠，美國海軍造船廠，陸軍兵工廠，杜邦軍火廠，通用汽車公司，等三十家，都被迫停工。各該公司接受政府定造軍火軍械總値四千五百萬元，佔全部軍用品三分之一，一時都不能交貨。</p>
<p>各工廠罷工原因，歸納起來，不外數端：第一，加薪問題。工人們揣測將來的生活程度將步步高漲，他們要求資方簽訂相加工資台同，預事應付。經濟學家們雖警告他們說，增加工資將促成通貨膨脹，反而减少工人的實際利一益，但他們仍不相信。</p>
<p>第二，工人方面意欲爭取工會的法定地位。以爲倘不在聚急時期鞏固本身地位，一旦和平恢復，勢將歸於混汰。</p>
<p>第三，工會內部的傾軋。工業組織委員會和美國勞工聯合會爲美國兩大勞工團體，他們互爭系統，勢不兩立，由來已久。其中工業組織委員會中的人物，屬於國防工業者居多，他們對於會中少數共產份子，認爲眼中之釘，非排斥不可</p>
<p>當工潮蔓延滋長的時候，法國與論如火如荼，衆議院司法委員會主席蘇南斯肝火直冒提倡言潛匿工廠內的敵人，應處以電刑。陸軍部長史汀生也軍高了沙啞的喉嚨，創議派遣全隊肅淸工廠裹搗亂份子。</p>
<p>最發噱的要算是空軍將領勃萊特了，他主張派軍用飛機，在罷工各工廠上空集隊示威，叫罷工者認識自己使命的重大，因而知所警惕。國會議員台斯痛駡共產黨爲「豺狼」，歷有年所，此刻更暴跳如雷，要求肅淸一切赤色工人。華盛頓有一位軍官，甚至發誓說，美國陸軍第一個槍靶，不是敵人而是本國人。同時騐測民意所也發表統計，全國人民贊成用强硬手段制正國防工業各廠工潮約估百分之七十二。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統見到這種情形，認爲勞資問題非積極處理不可，經過仔細考慮之後，就在三月底下令組織國防工業仲裁委員會，作爲調解工潮的量高機關。這種委昌會有委員十一人，內有民衆代表三人，爲惠司康新大學校長狄克斯脫拉（担任該會主席）北加羅里那大學校長格萊亨，紐約律師台維斯；勞方代表四人，為工業組織委員會主席摩萊，美國礦工聯合會會計長甘納第，美國勞工聯合會會計梅埃納，鐵路職工協會主席赫列遜；資方代表四人，為美國橡膠業聯合會董事秦錫魯，紐遮賽州美孚油公司董事長梯奇爾，出版界富豪即華盛頓郵報發行人梅耶，美利堅夏威夷輪船公司董事長萊赫姆。</p>
<p>勞工部長裴金斯女士巴不得有人來出任艱鉅，一聽見國防工業仲裁委員會成立的消息，就聲明該部原來所設的仲裁委員會，暫時退避賢路，這與新委員以不少的便利。並於羅斯福總統所設立的委員會職權範圍，依照總統指令，分為（一）商訂協定，（二）試行仲裁，（三）　集民意。各委員如有疑難不決的事情，得呈請總統最後決作定。就大體而論，這種組織與。</p>
<p>第一决歐戰時，威爾遜總統所創設的戰時全國勞工委員會，皆趣相似。但該會進行工作之前，又起了一個小小波折，原來勞工部長裴金斯還不曾請他們調解任何工潮，工界領袖希爾門又出門養疴，羅斯福總統也到弗洛利達州海濱休息，一時羣龍無首，諸事難成。</p>
<p>虧得陸軍部長史汀生和海軍部長諾克斯尙留京中，他們見機而作，婉言促請工人先行回廠復工，工業組織委員會所屬工人，雖有一部份照辦，但大部分斤斤於復工條件，難以馴服。終於由裴金斯從新墨西哥州把四件罷工案提交仲裁委員會處理，該會主席狄克斯脫拉接到這宗工作，連忙召集全體委員會議商討大計。</p>
<p>果然，事在人爲，他們最先戢止了西克洛普廠醞釀的工潮，繼之伐那地恩公司僵持四十天的工潮，杜別留電氣公司哈凡斯脫公司勞資糾紛，也宜吿解決。僅在短短的三天功夫，他們就宜佈大部份工廠將立刻先行復工，再談條件。這是他們初次的勝利。</p>
<p>另一方面，我們從統計上看，也可證明美國流行一時的工潮，已日就式微。例如本年四月一日至七日一星期中，國防工業工廠罷工案，已從四十起减至二十七起，罷工人數也從四萬七千名，减至四萬名。全國工廠現有三千六百萬工人。仍在照常工作，故工潮前途，已大可樂觀。</p>

<h3>經濟樷談</h3>
<p>— 馬柳堂</p>
<p>銀行週報（續十一日）</p>
<p>因爲中國第一家交易所——上海證券物品交易所開辦了，徐永祚担任規畫編制交易所的會計事務、民國十年，遂由徐滄水繼任總編輯。及滄水去世，又由主編北京銀行月刊的戴露廬其事，戴去而李權畤來，此人事變遷之大略。</p>
<p>銀行週報旣每週發行一次，故有每週的商情，金融，及論文，通訊，調查，統計諸門，開創了經濟雜誌編制的方案。自有此方案，而後經濟刊物遂不患無所取則，一種一種的繼起發行。即耿愛德報告之深得中國銀行界注意，亦爲銀行週報迻譯之功居多，否則耿之名，不能如是賴揚於中國商界中！</p>
<p>爲了上海銀行界有銀行週報，北京銀行界亦開辦銀行月刊。銀行月刊初發行的時候，還是上海銀行週報社派人去幫辦；每期只刊載中國銀行所收到各地分行的通信報告，其後纔由戴露廬進去，方亦有了論文等著作。</p>
<p>後乎北京銀行月刊的，則有漢口銀行公會而由李孤帆去辦的銀行雜誌，當時本要請潘士浩去編輯，士浩病，遂由其兄潘更生去創刊，後來由周沉剛繼續編下去。</p>
<p>至如今，仍在繼續發行中，恐衹有首先發行的銀行週報一家。</p>
<p>在民國五六年，時人雖知注重經濟文字，然能寫者眞如鳳毛麟角。自有了銀行周報，耳濡目染，經濟文字，漸爲人所習。即現在號稱爲經濟學者專家，在當時大都是默默無聞，且多數恐猶在求學時期，不若今日之目空一切，不可一世。然正見得是進步，進步乃是可喜之現象，所謂「後生可畏，焉知來者之不如今」，亦即「天行健，君子自强不息」之義。</p>
<p>統計之得見稱於世，在以前只有關冊一種，然首先利用關冊分類編製成書的，則爲黃任之。楊端六與侯厚培所編的遠在其後。當然，以後的編著，有勝於前者，然在黃任之編著的時候，時代不同，有此見解，確乎其不可及了。關冊的統計，利用固有的材料，由外人整理而成，尚不爲難。若由中國人自己創辦出來的統計，那不得不推民國八年開辦的駐滬調查貨價處爲鼻祖，即今之國定稅則委員會的前身。至是方有中國自編的各種統計行世。而在世界各國統計中占得一席地。銀行週報亦繼起按月編制了經濟統計，印成小冊，隨報附送，將逐日行市彙載下來，深便檢查，當然內容是注重金融方面居多。</p>
<p>向握上海金融界牛耳之錢業，亦不甘落後，終於由秦潤卿發起，至民國十年二月，遂有錢業月報發行，主編爲屠光甫，十六年秋屠辭職，遂成立委員會，由胡叔仁，王楚聲，王維喬，魏友棐，先後任編輯，至二十六年十二月因事變停刊，發行十七卷。　（完）</p>
<h3>證券內債多方　作有力之拉抬</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况、初疲後堅、因連日疲軟、多方奮最後之努力、午後從事拉抬、信孚首先動辦、同康隨、乃得引起一部份之補空、但漲勢顯有勉强、雖在高價收盤、但比收盤小一二角賣出、竟無人接受、此種情形、毋乃爲多方覓途出籠之技巧、觀甲種只好二角、而丙種竟好六角之多、畸形狀况、姑觀今日趨勢可也、昨上午怡泰鴻大稍有買是進、同康·聯和·教餘賣出、午收跌多漲少、午後信孚抬價收買、因之同康補回、生大亦隨眾補空、乃引起鴻大之加碼、久孚亦稍有吸收、但怡泰已在轉賣、聯和繼續賣出、樂茂益昌潤利斬多、市價雖抬高二角至六角、收盤後衹有賣出、無人買進、在表面上回好二角至六角不等、成交總數共計約一百三四十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新新公司股二百股、價爲二十一元正、</p>
<p>眾業公所股市開盤穩定、嗣因滬市報鬆、趨勢又轉軟化、除橡皮股外、其餘成交尚盛、價在近收盤時、略有進步、但衹較最低價稍高而已、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗銷衰退跌風倏起</h3>
<p>週末稍定之紗市、今則又復下降、且跌風殊熾、此因外滙續鬆、標金下落、以致人心虛怯、至於實銷益覺不暢、不過廣幫對於十支粗紗、仍有零星需要、所以有一部分大戶多頭、安然不放、因之市情、曾見一度徘徊、但空方近因日紗不振、雜牌紗交易缺乏、而環境欠佳、於是傾向拋賣、跌風一起、賣者紛至沓來、總之、目前看跌之人眾、非有在批交易發展、市面當無轉機希望也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百七十元、低價爲一千四百三十三元、午後市况極爲紊亂、初作一千四百二十九元、因取引所紗價慘落、人心惶恐、直瀉至一千四百零七元、但盈利者奮起扒補、回上至一千四百二十九元收盤、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因大家多頭、仍來拉提、惟金子幫已有回出、首盤價爲一千四百五十五元、旋以多頭活動力尚强、同時標金平平、又升至一千四百六十九元至七十元、不過現銷僅有粗紗交易、二十支紗平常、然人心把持甚力、在六十五六元往返多時、豈料時近十一時三刻、擡面突然虛弱、爲金子下墜、滙票鬆落、賣風狂起、市盤步步下降、至一千四百三十三元收盤、查半日間成交統計一萬零三百二十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量如左、</p>
<p>香港　五二〇　同行　九、八〇〇</p>
<p>統計　一〇、三二〇</p>
<p>現棉情況、零落不堪、此因紗價慘落、中外各廠對於原料絕少採辦意思、所以棉市亦被牽入漩渦中矣、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布跌得兇　行市直下</h3>
<p>廠布　結晶體市跌風大熾、乃因人心動搖、浮多傾賣、斬結、而吸戶寥寥、故布價一瀉直下、結果白貨細布跌每疋一元至一元半、粗布斜紋跌每疋五角至七角半、漂染布跌一元左右、市場甚爲混亂、而成交稀少，本街成交各貨一百餘件、客幫各貨緩辦衹粵港幫辦九磅怡和粗布·本廠斜紋色布等一百餘件、新加坡暹邏等地辦漂染布二千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　因紗綫猛跌、實銷又呆、人心大虛、各布乃一致慘落、現貨市場、白貨龍頭細布下午最小價見四十六元三角、中途空戶扒補、回升至四十八元二角卒以市氣仍疲、降至四十七元六角收盤、色貨四君子嗶嘰價尤紊亂、晨開一元五角一二分、步跌至一元四角七分半後市開盤直瀉至一元四角、收盤爲一元四角四分二五、</p>
<h3>呢絨節節高　樂路步步退</h3>
<p>昨呢絨售價依然堅昂、除派力司一種較賤外、餘則無一不在挺漲中、因海外定貨須先付定銀並須先購外匯、定貨完全頓停、至以前所定者、則運到困難、能到與否又難預期、本廠貨爲原料缺貴、出品寡而定價漲、又因滬地法幣過剩、業內外收囤不衰、人心乃益堅固、然一觀銷路方面、（一）爲交通阻梗、內地幫停辦、倫陷區打搬運證困難、故皆不能暢辦、（二）因百物上漲漫無止境、生活程度日形高壓、呢絨實銷自亦隨之削弱矣、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球暗盤消滅</h3>
<p>門市槪售十六元</p>
<p>煤球行情、前月底因有利多傳說、一般囤戶、暗盤抬至三百三十元、旋因廠方限期出淸、現貨兩百九十六元、儘量供給、致老單不能久囤、暗市亦不攻自破、恢復常態、門莊每担槪售十六元、（有每担上五元教課　則係小廠貨例外）、但遠期尚欲看漲、無期棧單、照盤抬高十五元行情云、</p>
<h3>糖市　現糖趨勢續疲</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨續向下遊、惟遠期返升、公會劃盤二四粗白、外棧現貨一百十四元七角至八角·七角、小一元、二十日打單開盤一百十五元至四角·二角·一角、小八角、月底打單一百十七元至八角·九角·六角·四角·六角·三角、計升三角、太古車白B嘜本棧一百十六元、西棧一百十五元五角、小一元、DY嘜東棧一百零四元、小二元、HX　東棧一百零三元、僅小二角、</p>
<h3>橡膠（續）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>到公元一八二三年，橡膠的用途第一次擴充了。因爲在英國格拉斯哥城有一個名叫Macintosh的大化學工業家，他找出來橡膠的融解劑，——是用Benzine——能把橡膠融化了，攤在兩層薄布中間，造成「雨衣」，他在曼徹斯特建設一座大工廠，從事製造，此後雨衣就用他的名字風行各處，稍後，後一八二九年，又有一個叫Guibal和一個叫Rattier的，——法國人？——第一次利用橡膠的伸縮性以造成「襪帶」和「褲帶」，就是他們把橡膠球從中剖開，再把每半用螺旋形的樣子部成長帶，然後再分割成絲條，夾織在棉綫中間就成功了。這種製品也風行全球，一直到現在。</p>
<p>然而限制橡膠的長足發展的，就是它本身的一個大缺點，它在天氣過熱，到了三四十度的時候，就會發生黏滯，隨以崩壞，伸縮性和不透水性全一筆勾銷了。可是氣候過於嚴寒呢，它又變成硬綁綁的，脆而易碎，這種缺憾，也在一八三九年，被一個名叫Goodyer的美國工業家給它彌補了，Goodyer生於New．Haven城，初造農具，後來家道中落，纔把目標轉到橡膠業身上。他想改良橡膠的固結性，就把各種物質攙雜到它裏邊從事試騐。有一天，他偶而把硫磺與橡膠混合，用高熱度去融燒，想不到的，產出來的橡膠竟堅靭牢固，不易融解，高熱和嚴寒全不要想搖動它分毫，橡膠的事業，這纔一日千里，在一八五一年，又有一個名叫Myrey的法國人，把同橡膠混合的硫磺量加重到三倍，結果呢，完成出來的東西，——硬性橡皮，——緊緻瑩明，易於琢磨，完全如同實貴的烏木一樣。於是木核，鈕扣，碗碟……妝飾品，日用品，又一大批所謂「電木」的東西出來了。誰知道將來的橡膠要發展到什麼地步呢？</p>
<p>橡膠的品質極不一律，其初以中美洲一帶的Castilloa橡膠爲最佳，現在因土人的採伐，幾瀕絕種，十九世紀中葉以後，巴西國亞馬孫河河口。南邊的Para城輸出最多，品質也最好，就是人所稱爲「Para橡膠」的，所謂Catilloa橡樹，是分佈在從墨西哥起到秘魯止的一帶山地的，最初印第安人的取膠，是把橡樹伐倒，分成節段的「竭澤而漁」，也有在樹身上斫成螺旋紋或大V字形的割口，這種舉動是那麼野蠻，以致橡樹往往因所流「植物血」過多而致枯死，土人用器皿接得那白色的乳汁後，用一種黏土搏成梨形的圓球，蘸在乳汁裏，拿出來，在日光下曬乾或用烟熏乾，那泥球上面就有了一層極薄的膠皮了。以後再蘸再弄乾，　那膠皮相當的厚了，把泥楦砸碎掏出，就成功前邊所謂「有伸縮性的梨形器皿」了。</p>
<p>巴西的Para橡膠，出自名叫Hovea的橡樹身上，這樹又分兩種，一黑一白，遍佈在亞馬孫河幹流和支流的兩岸各處，就是那著名的人跡尚未全到的塞爾瓦斯大森林裏，採橡膠的人，葡萄牙文叫作Seringueros，大槪集中在瑪瑙斯（Manaos）城——就是雄踞在亞馬孫河與內革維河交會點的那繁華的瑪瑙斯城附近一帶，當着從前橡樹繁多，觸目皆是的時候，這些或男或女的Seringueros，在每天黎明，就背筐携籃，帶着刀斧盆盎，往目的地出發，到遽以後，分頭尋覔橡樹，——也可稱爲植物牛，——用刀斧在樹幹上割成裂口，下邊用黏泥把盆盎粘住，或逕自放在地上，以後那自裂口中涓涓流下的乳汁，乳汁的流出，大槪從三小時到十一小時便停止，於是印第安人把各處的乳汁集合起來，開始薰烤的工作，在這種工作以前，必需先建築一座小土窰，上邊罩一個金屬的烟囱，裏面焚燒新劈下來的棕櫚枝葉，以便烟氣更爲濃厚，火引着了，便用一隻木鏟，蘸了乳汁，伸到烟囱上去薰，於是薰了蘸，蘸了薰，橡膠層層積集，組成球狀，有的能重到五十公斤，這就是那膠質最純粹最優良的所謂Para城，轉運歐洲各國了。</p>
<p>現在的情形有點兩樣，附近的橡樹，旣被土人們旦旦而伐，稀而又稀了，他們不能不駕着一葉扁舟，上溯亞馬孫河及其支流，去尋覔新的原野，而且季節也有限制了，大槪是從七月到十月，他們去時，至少兩人一組，擇定登陸的地點和薰橡膠用的小土窰，然後很艱辛的往各處尋覔橡樹，因爲現在這橡，總是非常疎落稀少的，雖說在離河流較遠的那「處女森林」裏，一定還有很多的「植物牛」滋生着，然而毒蛇叢生，猛獸遍野，進去着實有點冒險，而且路途遙遠，經費也須要很多哩。</p>

<h3>杜防囤積平均分配　港米將限制購量　每人不得超過一月需要　米行號定米將儘先分配　運米橡皮輪小車工人昨晨罷工</h3>
<p>據立基洋行負責人昨日吿記者稱、首批港米五千噸、計裝四船、除昨日（即前日）抵滬之太古公司漢陽輪及怡和公司之明生輪外、昨日續到太古公司太原輪江蘇輪兩艘、此外尙有一艘為裕生輪、亦可望於星期六以前抵滬、聞官方在一二日內、即將發表文吿、宣佈發售辦法、除價格質量已有規定、為每石合八十公斤、即一百六十市斤售一百十元、並嚴禁抬價攙雜外、據立基洋行可靠消息、將規定每一顧客所購米糧、不得超過一個月以外之糯要量、至一個月應需若干米糧、則由承銷者規定之、聞此項規定、完全為防止有人囤積、因次月之糧、又有另一批港米供給、無需多儲也、</p>
<p>尙有四輪　運米來滬</p>
<p>又據探悉、本前、將有大宗米糧抵滬、聞一宗爲法公董局所訂購之西貢米、共爲一萬噸、其中一部、將由法輪GouvenneutGen．A．Varenne號及Albert　Sarraut號承載來滬、除下述二輪外、另有渣華公司之貨輪二艘、將於本月二十三日、可運大批米糧抵滬、故預料將來米價、在供過於求時、必將繼續大跌、</p>
<p>所到港米　大半零售</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局向香港採辦運滬發售之首批米糧五千六百噸抵埠後、今（十二日）晨米價復從一百二十五元跌落五元、負責人士聲稱、首批港米中之六百噸、將交批發米商、餘五千噸之大半、定今日或明日（十三日）分發另售米店、以最高一百十元之價出售、米蠹則料天雨將使港米運滬因之愆期、乃於上星期六日稍將米價扳回、今晨仍圖抬高米價、但已技窮米價終跌五元、</p>
<p>二批港米　週內運到</p>
<p>聞他批港米、可望於週內抵滬，且此後按月將有港米約二萬五千噸運到、同時、法當局現候其向越南採辦之首批貢米八千噸抵埠、其售價最高百元、</p>
<p>定單數量　超過到額</p>
<p>此次所到港米係小絞米、與市上所售仰光四十粒小絞米一般無二、日前米蠹濫放謠言、此項小絞米內多碎米等等、自當不攻而自破、至各雜糧行及米號前往祥茂洋行徼納貨款者、終日不絕、惟此次所到之港米、僅五萬餘包、而各雜糧行及米號所預定之米、當超過此數數倍有奇、故此次先到之米、只能由各雜糧行及米號先行分配若干包、以維持繼續抵埠後、再行補足預定數目、目前該項分配手續、已由立基洋行着手辦理、據該洋行某職員吿記者稱、分配手續、可於昨日辦理完竣、俟送工部局審核定後、即可開始分配發售、</p>
<p>米蠹驚惶　市價續瀉</p>
<p>邇日米市塲買賣情形、已日趨良好、統計一週以來、各擋米價平均已下落三十元左右、一般持貨米蠹、頗驚惶失措、咸將大宗囤貨抑價求脫、昨晨米市　開做後、因首批廉價洋米已抵埠、米囤戶紛將囤貨求脫、以致市塲現貨供過於求、人心一致看小、米號巳無意再在市塲扒吸現貨、靜待米價之繼續下落、其時市况頗一蹶不振、結果各擋米價卒較前市回降四五元一石不等、今洋米最高價爲一百廿八元、國米最高價爲一百三十七元、</p>
<p>運米車夫　昨晨罷工</p>
<p>本市拖拉橡皮輪小車、專代米行裝運米糧之小車工人、共達一千數百人、滬戰發生後、因搶米風潮不斷發生、加之米價飛漲、故各米行均漸次改用卡車裝運、以期减少搶刦事件、及無謂損失、漸至全部改用卡車、雖經小車工人一再要求維持原狀、以維生計、迄今數月、仍無效果、近以物價飛騰、故各工人乃積極請求救濟、終以米行公會無表示、致相持不決、</p>
<p>生計威迫　各工人、飢寒交迫雖經要求限期答覆、及向工部局請願、終以無法維生、故於昨日上午八時起、全體實行罷工、（車輛均未拖出）而全體工人一千餘人、則齊集堆存米粗之中國棧順泰棧等洋棧前、一方派遣代表二百餘人、至山海關路懋業里米行公會北辦事處請願、工部局警務處以罷工工人人數衆多、深恐發生其他越軌行動、故特派大批探捕、在工人集結處所維持秩序、米行公　辦事處當派秘書王雨亭、邀工人代表鄭學元劉守銘二人談話、勸各工人靜候當局調處、以免工潮擴大、</p>
<p>當局咨詢　公共租界工部局以事態重大、且有關整個民食問題、故除派警探保護外、並派政治部探員李弼軍等分別進行調查糾紛眞相、一方復邀米行公會主席符前耕至政治部咨詢、並定今明日召集雙方代表、進行調解、以期工潮早日解決、米行公會並於昨日下午二時、邀集前任工人總代表張茂才李國柱劉于富等三人至公會談話、以便從中談判、</p>
<p>今日請願　至於目下担任裝運米糧之卡車工人、聞米車工人罷工事件後、耶曾派員與小車工人代表接洽、亦願予以同情援助罷工工人因人數衆多，誠恐發生越軌行動、故特組織糾察隊該罷工工人並定今日向工部局請願、</p>

<h3>方單案昨最後辯護　兩造辯論激烈　原吿律師引證地皮章程　藍道吿示不能作為依據</h3>
<p>華籍地主四人控訴工部局徵收方單地稅一案、領事法庭、於昨日下午二時半、假工部局會議室、舉行最後一决之辯護庭、出庭者爲法官英總領事喬治·美總領事洛克赫德·日總領事堀內。被吿律師博良·原吿律師劉世芳。王健、由英總領事喬治任首席法官、雙方辯論達二小時之久、對洋涇浜地皮章程及費唐報吿書中涉及方單地捐者、均有劇烈之辯論、惟何日判決、昨日尙未有庭諭、預料至遲在一一星期後、</p>
<p>原吿津師　所述焦點</p>
<p>開庭後、原吿律師劉世芳起立謂、此案事實簡單、原吿四人、均爲方單地所有人之後裔、旣未售與他人、亦未出租、此種事實、兩方均無所爭執、故本案焦點、純爲法律間題、即工部局是吾有權對方單地征收捐稅、證之洋涇浜地皮章程、一八七〇年納稅西人會主席麥特赫司脫之演辭、工部局皆無權收捐、且一八五五年藍道台之吿示、亦不能作爲可以收捐之依據、以在未出吿示前、藍道台曾與英美法領事交換文件、稱中國舊居戶、有權繼續在租界居住、此等人與由避難而入租界者不　、</p>
<p>無權征收　方單地稅</p>
<p>劉繼述公共租界爲中國土地、係中國政府將朴一地區租與外人居住、此在國際公法上稱之爲「役權」、中國政府賦與收捐之權、故此種權力、勢必需在有利於授役者之解釋、如工部局主張已有收稅權、則須有明白之證明與確切之理由、而不能僅憑類推也、况中國政府始終保有主權、對工部局徵收方單地稅、旣絕未同意、且常阻工部局之收捐耶、至工部局是否有權因拒絕付捐而可將電流自來水供給切斷、此必須依據法院之判決、即在費唐報吿中、指出在法院未判決前、不肯使用暴力、切斷其電流及自來水、工部局爲行政機關、如同時成爲立法機關、則又何事不可爲、</p>
<p>被吿何能　濫用權力</p>
<p>劉氏繼稱、領事法庭與普通法院不同、旣非適用某一國家之法律、則其裁判、必須根據法律原理與公平之見解、原吿等旣世居斯土、無論何人不能迫其出賣所有土地、故藍道臺之告示、實不能適用於彼等、被吿雖主張上海公共租界之組織、謂係合意的團體、但原吿則並非其中一份子、因此一團體所召集之議會、華人並未有權參加也、如欲以合意團體之理論、加於原吿、則實屬毫無根據、如必須令原吿付捐、則必需修改地皮章程、此則又必需徵得中國政府之同意、推而言之、即使工部局有權收取此項地捐、亦應向所管轄之法院起訴、工部局似無濫用權力之理、</p>
<p>被吿律師　提出答辯</p>
<p>繼博良起立謂、原吿等土地所有權、係自一八五五年起此時雖在第三次擴大租界區域之前、但尙在原來英租界設立之後、故一八五四年之地皮章程及藍道臺告示、亦得適用於彼等、當臨時法院改組爲特區法院時、所簽訂之協定內、載明地皮章程爲中國政府所承認、故地皮章程當然有效、地皮章程中旣載明納稅西人會有權徵收其他捐稅、故依據此一規定、工部局當然可以向原吿等徵收方單地稅、</p>
<p>藉辭推翻　費唐報吿</p>
<p>依照前美租界章程、中國地主可無須繳納地捐、但原地主則並不包括繼承人、今原吿所稱國際役權一說、係根據一刁姓博士之論文、自不能與國際間權威著作相提並論、依據國際法學家瑪氏之意見、凡條約在政治脅迫情形之下所訂立者、則屬無效、故應以國際公法爲依據、今費唐報吿書中所謂工部局不能自方單地征稅、當然不十分正確、至原吿所稱、所有不付捐稅者、必須經法院判決後、始可切斷其電流及自來水之供給、則本法庭早已於受理相同之案件中、判決可以切斷電流與自來水、本案情節與前案既同、故木法庭應照前例判決、</p>
<p>不能發生　追溯效力</p>
<p>此時劉律師起立稱、所謂原吿取得所有權、係在一八五五年、此事與事實不符、按此時爲咸豐五年、即爲發給方單之時、此項方單、亦即係替代一七八〇年所　之方單者、故足證原告祖先、在一七八〇年前、即已居住於此間矣、被吿又稱、依照最近修改之地皮章程、被吿有權徵收地捐、但此舉是吾有效、固可置不論、但工部局亦不能因此决修改、而有權發生法律上之追溯效力、</p>
<p>藍道吿示　華文為準</p>
<p>又被吿稱、藍道台吿示、應以英文為準、實屬太無理由、因藍道台之吿示、係發與華人觀看、何能以英文爲準、今汝保彝認中英文相符、無異承認在政治脅迫下所訂之條約、認爲有效、何矛盾至此、費唐法官係由工部局重金聘請、經一年之久、始作成報吿書、今被吿對原吿依據該報吿書所立論各點認爲無價値、此則爲余所不勝惋惜者、</p>
<p>要求得一　公平判決</p>
<p>以前本法庭對相同案件、曾有切斷電流自來水之判決、余早已聲明此種根據合意團體之理論、已不能適用、故該案不能作爲本案之先例、每案之情形旣不同、應就案論案、以期得一公平之判決、今余向貴法庭請求者、即工部局無權徵收此項地稅、且該項微收權之是吾存在、尙有極大之疑問、貴法庭實應命令工部局、尋求外交方式解決云、訊至此、已爲四時一刻、各法官略作會商、即於四時二十五分宣吿退庭、</p>
<h3>失足墮浦身死</h3>

<h3>日方在蘇州河鑿船　西報調查詳盡　三日內被毀二百五十艘　流離失所者一千五百人</h3>
<p>自十一日本埠各報披露英文大美晚報記載、謂沿蘇州河麥根路至昌平路一帶、十日晨凄風苦雨中有舢舨百餘艘、被日軍鑿沉或被沒收、致浮家泛宅者數百人、竟吿流離失所、中外各方、對此輩遭遇之慘、莫不寄予深切之同情、詎日方海軍發言人及同盟社决日突鄭重吾認其事、但昨日出版之英文大美晚報、除將十日晨實地調查時所攝得之照片八幅、製版刊佈外、並揭發九日及十一日兩日尙有同樣事件發生、前後被鑿沉之舢舨、約有二百五十艘、而因此流離失所者、約有一千五百人、</p>
<p>鑿船之事　又有發生</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、於日本海軍發言人、吾認日軍曾鑿沉舢板之四十八小時後、昨日又聞有小型舢板八十艘被鑿沉之事發生、據目擊者稱、有携帶利斧與巨鎚之日海軍特別陸戰隊士兵、於昨日又至前此沉船地點、迫令舟子、將舢舨鑿沉、如舟子有不願者、則日軍擬將該項舢舨拖至他處、今晨據一年已六十餘歲之老嫗含淚吿記者、伊全賴一年僅十六歲之子操小販爲生、故無力租屋、現伊等唯一棲息之所、已被破壞、其將來生活、實不堪設想、</p>
<p>調查結果　完全證實</p>
<p>據今晨（十二日）繼續調查之結果、業已完全證實上星期六（十日）所發生鑿船之舉、確有其事、字林西報及泰晤士報記載、謂日軍吾認其事、並稱本報披露是項消息爲「顚倒是非」、可證上述兩報、於該一事件發生後、並未派訪員赴該處實地調查也、據目擊者談、除上星期六所鑿沉之舢舨百餘艘外、上星期五、（九日）　有舢舨被鑿沉、共計前後被毀約爲二百五十艘、又聞尙有若干舢舨、已被日方拖曳以去、另有若干艘則爲船主拆作木料出售矣、</p>
<p>一部船戶　尙留河畔</p>
<p>麥根路一帶蘇州河畔、今晨見搭有蘆棚數個、據戈登路捕房高級警官今晨語記者、一部流離失所之舟子、大抵即棲身該處蘆棚內、現人數已日見减少、蓋捕房方面、不能尤彼等久居是處、該警官又稱、如彼等不迅即自動遜移、捕房方面、將被迫採取必要步驟而驅散之、然目前尙靜觀其發展云、聞日海軍特別陸戰隊之鑿船行動、爲搜尋若干恐怖份子、詎知已使華人約有一千五百名、於此大雨滂沱中、無家可歸也、</p>
<p>西報對此　有所評述</p>
<p>英文大美晚報、昨就日軍發言人吾認日軍有鑿沉舢舨一事、發表評論云、「日本發言人或將有一日、能向吾人解釋、在蘇州河鑿沉舢舨、致數百人慘遭流離失所之苦、對建設「新秩序」之過程中、將有何裨益、今吾人對「新秩序」之認識、委實過少、但深信日方之解釋、亦斷難令吾人滿意也、在過去四年中、日本所有作爲、殊不合理、今愈演愈烈、誠令吾人百思而不得其解、如爲仇視華人、則此舉殆已達於頂點矣、然吾人所不能吾認者、在道德立塲上言、日人中之有識者、必認日方此舉、係政治上之自殺政策、但所深惜者、此等頭腦淸晰之日人、僅屬少數、而由於此輩之沉默寡言、遂使日本今日陷於困境、故日本能在國際間能　行抬頭之日、必爲此輩由少數成爲多數、由沉默變爲敢言之時也、</p>
<h3>偉不醫院免費戒煙　第一期已斷癮</h3>
<p>偉光醫院、免費戒烟、成績昭著、茲第一期於本月一日進院住戒者、有在云生·學界、寓西門路十五號、張永培·郵工、寓派克路三二七弄一一四號、黃煥奎·教員、住貝勒路恒慶里十五號、三人業已戒除舊患、均於七日出院、第二期韋立生·張瑞卿·及卡巴羅（葡萄牙人）三人、即於同日進院、正在施治、查第一期尙有走戒者沈士才·翁人傑·趙金氏·三人、尙在診治中、蓋走戒者非卽日停止吸吃毒品、係逐步减少嗜好、故戒斷期間當較住院者稍爲延長、</p>
<h3>中匯銀行門首　傅品圭遇狙擊　傅避入保險汽車得倖免　保鑣張連宗中一彈斃命</h3>
<p>住居霞飛路一一八九號鎭海人已故傅筱庵之子傅品圭、今年四十七歲、在愛多亞路河南路口中滙銀行任董事有年、出入置有鋼甲保險汽車一輛代步、並僱用張連宗充保鑣、隨同出入保護、</p>
<p>公畢出門</p>
<p>昨中午十二點十分、傅品圭由中滙銀行辦公完畢、擬與其友回家進午膳、甫出銀行大門、其保鑣張連宗緊隨身後同行、正將路入汽車之際、路旁竄出預伏該處之靑年刺客上前袖出手槍、</p>
<p>開七八槍</p>
<p>對傅連開七八槍、時傅突聞槍聲、急即竄入其自己之保險汽車內躱避、未擊中、但傅之保鑣張連察覩狀、即從身上掏出手槍、欲圖還擊、奈自己背部已被擊穿一彈、受創倒仆於地、血如泉湧、刺客見傅之保鑣巳經擊倒、即四散逃逸、瞬即無蹤、</p>
<p>刺客遠颺</p>
<p>出事後、法租界麥蘭捕房近在咫尺、亦已得訊、立派大批武裝中西探趕到、即將該處一段之交通阻斷、實施搜查、但刺客已向公共租界逸去、僅在出事處所檢獲彈殼數枚、遂召救護車、將受傷者之張連宗送往廣慈醫院醫治、一面派探捕將事主傅品圭護送回家、一面由捕房傳令通班探員、查緝在逃兇手、</p>
<p>保鑣斃命</p>
<p>此案內幕、正由捕房嚴密偵查中、惟受傷之保鑣張連宗、送入醫院、因傷勢沉重、醫治無效、旋即斃命、</p>

<p>孔子學說　集五敎之大成　沈達齡在融五社講演詞</p>
<p>融五講經社第十五次講經，沈　靈君講孔子學說，不以儒限，云世人多以孔子爲儒教之宗，實則儒之地位，在班固漢書藝文志，僅居九流之一，孔子則删訂六經，其微言大義，直接伏義以至堯·舜·禹·湯·文·武·周公之心傅，論語堯曰篇尤執其中一語，即揭示孔學之所宗。孟子萬章篇，孔子，聖之時者也，孔子之謂集大成等語，公孫丑篇自有生民以來，未有孔子也。幷述子貢目生民以來，未有夫子也，有若自生民以來，未有盛於孔子也等語，尊之至矣。至史遷尊孔子爲至聖，遂爲古今定論，故藝文志開卷謂昔孔子沒而微言絕，七十子喪而大義乖，慨乎其言之，此殆劉向校經後著於七錄之語，而班固因襲之也</p>
<p>吾人徧考羣經，周禮天官大宰儒以道得民，爲儒之專責，禮記儒行一篇，孔子稱儒有者十五，而以聖人之儒終，使哀公不敢以儒爲戲而已。</p>

<h3>工部局特敎會　發表報吿書　（四）　建議一斑</h3>
<p>爲便於參考起見、茲將各項建議簡列於後、（一）公共租界之教育責任、第一屬於各國居民團體、其决方及於工部局、（二）工部局之教育施政方針、應趨向補助金辦法之擴充、各國僑民、學校之增設、以及直接教育設備之嚴格限制、（三）現行教育經費之限制辦法、應予明白取消、暫時撥發充分經費、以維持現在進行中之教育工作、（四）教育經費之分配於一·華籍、二·日籍及三·外籍學童方面、應按照各該籍居民付捐情形爲比例、（五）一俟財政情形好轉、教育經費應予加捐超過第三節規定之最低數目、再加撥之經費、並應用以使包括於第四節之原則、易於運用、（六）現有之局立學校、移歸僑民團體辦理一節、無論在論理上與第一·二·四各節之原則相符、在目前狀况之下、未便實行、（七）補助金之撥發、得由補助金小組委員會、在較可伸縮之情形下、自由處置、用以舉辦與助成特殊教育計劃、以利整個公共租界、並得用以扶助現有之學校、（八）補助金不得發給牟利之學校、（九）領受補助金之各校、得由學務處派員視察、（十）局立各校之直接開支、應盡量以學費收人柢補之、但勿以困難加諸家長、（十）（一）學務處長一職、在現仟處長吿退以後、仍應保留、</p>
<p>現行制度</p>
<p>各局立學校以及教育行政、均維持其高度效能、學務處長即將吿退、吿退以後、應吾任命其繼任者、抑或任其懸虛、而責成中西籍教育主管人員分別負責處理華童與西童學校以及撥發補助事宜、凡此種種均經本委員會討論、結果認爲學務處長一職、仍應保留綜理教靑事務、否則組織與責仟一經劃分、將損及對內行政與對外管理上之效率、但爲節省經費起見、所有學務處外籍幫辦一職、似可撤消、</p>
<p>關於補助金之辦法、木委員之見解如下、</p>
<p>甲、應授權各核　補助金之委員會、在較可伸縮之情形下、白由支配補助金、不受以往分配辦法之限制、並得提撥一部份補助金、充作有利於公衆之特殊計劃之用、例如、</p>
<p>（一）獎勵與協助獨立團體慈善機關以及個人在公共租界無充分學校設備之區域內、添設小學、</p>
<p>（二）在貧寒子弟之小學校內、設置基本衛牛學一科、</p>
<p>（三）與工業社會處合作、舉辦工業技術訓練事宜、</p>
<p>（四）在中等學校內、添辦特別職業補習班、</p>
<p>（五）協助學校實騐教授法之改進、</p>
<p>乙、不得以補助金發給任何學校、其目的在求私利者、</p>
<p>丙、領受工部局補助金之各校、除應由衛生·工務·火政三處派員查察以外、得由學務處派員前往視察、</p>
<p>因滙價之低落與物價之高漲、維持局立學校之費用、勢須增加、故本委員會求　建議任何大量緊縮辦法、上年度教育費預算醫內所列支出之百分之八十二、爲教職員之薪給、（包括養老金在內、其中大部份內契的關係、碍難减縮、倘非裁員或减薪、則經費無法核减、裁員辦法之實施、必須犧牲辦事效率而後可、而减薪一節、對於聘任教員及教務之標準、亦將發生影響、本委員會以爲如將華童學校之西籍校長、代以華籍人員、當可節省若干、此事工部局方面已定爲一種方針矣、</p>
<p>關於學費問題、本委員會主張、局立各校之直接開支、應盡量以學費收入抵補之、但勿以困難加諸學生家長、</p>
<p>附錄華籍委員致特別委</p>
<p>員會之備忘錄</p>
<p>（一）工部局有道德上之義務、對於納稅人之兒童（不論國籍）、供給教育設施、並就整個社會福利之觀點而言、甚望工部局能盡量供給此種設施、（二）工部局現行教育方針、有雙重看法、</p>
<p>（一）設置公立學校、（二）以補助金補助私立學校、本委員等以爲關於華人教育方面、此項方針將來不應變更、工部局學校應在改進教授法與健全之管理方面、爲私立學校樹一模範、至於補助金辦法、則應以提高私立學校之標準爲目的、（三）教育經費分配於華意與西童學校之間、應更臻公允、在任何平均分配辦法中、並應注意兩起、即華人與外僑所付捐稅之數目、以及入學兒童之人數、（四）年秋季學期、各局立華童學校連同夜校共有註册學生八·四七九人、依據一九三五年之調查所得、公共租界（界外馬路區域除外）內共有華籍學齡兒童（在五歲與十五歲之間）一四九。五四二人、可知就學於局立學校之華籍學齡兒童、僅占全數百分之五·七、至於公共租界連同界外馬路區域以內之西籍學齡兒童、依據上項調查、計有五·四〇五人、上年秋季學期各西童公學內、共有註册學生一·二八七人、占全數百分之三十五、由此觀之、工部局對於作育華童方面、並未負起首要責任、用是本委員等主張應加撥華人教育經費、並添設華童學校、以達至少有百分之十之華籍　齡兒童就學於局立學校之程度、藉以消除上述之不平等情形、（五）教育經費、在一九三四年閒、曾規定不得超過等於捐稅徵收率二厘之收入、此項辦法迄未變更、當一九三五年適用此項原則時、捐率爲百分之十四、但目下捐率業經提高、故上項限制率、亦應提高、至少達到從前一比七之稈度、　（完）</p>

<h3>思想離婚的新理由</h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>如果你到業已淪亡的挪威去，聽見一對夫妻因爲「政見不同」而離異，你切莫以爲奇怪。因爲這是已經有「明令宣佈」的了。</p>
<p>今日在挪威的夫妻當中，如果有一方不造成希特勒或奎斯令，反對納煽動哲學，反對挪威傀儡政權，希望英國戰勝者，另一方立即可以提出離異。</p>
<p>這對於感情業已破裂，或者另有新歡的丈夫或妻子，當然是一件「德政」；可是一個政府而需要以這種統制思想的手段去使民眾「安分守已」者，也徒然表現其主義上的破綻而已。</p>
<p>看得遠一點，在歷史上，能夠以武裝的力量而阻止社會的進步，永久壓制民眾合理範圍的思想自由者，似乎尚「未之前見」也。</p>

<h3>徐悲鴻在南洋</h3>
<p>— 潔</p>
<p>在承平時代，一些藝人的行動，早就爲人所注意，在國家對外作戰時，其實，更將爲人所懷念。名畫家徐悲鴻先生在戰事爆發的第　年，隨國立中央大學遷重慶，路過漢口時，早被郭沫若一把拖住，硬要請他擔任政治部第一廳的藝術科科長。徐敎授一身青布衣衫，跑進門禁森嚴的武裝地帶，總感若干千格，因此，他悄悄地溜到重慶，還是坐他老本行的冷板凳。</p>
<p>戰事第一年（廿七年），印度詩聖太戈爾特電邀徐氏赴印度國際大學講學、途次適逢廣州淪陷，交通的阻隔，把他鎖住在西江流域四十多天，後來終於繞道抵達香港，然後搭船到印度。從這時起，徐敎授便在新嘉坡加爾各答等地，連續舉行四次畫展，將舊畫全部收入五十餘萬元。掃數捐助難民、華僑的熱心祖國。早爲人所知，這次徐敎授在南洋所辦各屆畫展，莫不大獲成功，其最顯著一點，乃是「涓滴歸公」。莫怪僑胞大受感動，大家踴躍輸將了！那些展覽會是：</p>
<p>廿八年三月在新嘉坡舉行畫展，收入一萬三千七百叨幣，合國幣十二萬元餘。</p>
<p>卅年二月在吉隆坡舉行畫展，收入一萬七千八百叨幣，合國幣十五萬元餘。</p>
<p>卅年三月在怡保城舉行畫展，收入叨幣一萬，合國幣八萬餘元。</p>
<p>卅年四月在檳榔嶼舉行畫展，收入一萬二千叨幣，合國幣十萬元餘。</p>
<p>以上四次畫展，全部收入幾達國幣五十萬元，開了全國畫家個人畫展收入之空前記錄。此次所以獲得如此成績者，顯然一因徐敎授的湛深的藝術，早爲各界人士所敬仰；之因僑胞熱心愛國，踴躍輸將；三因徐敎授堅持將全部收入掃作難民捐，而其私人旅費，生活費，　各畫之裱工等，均由徐敎授私人籌措。這種精神，造成了中國藝壇上獨特的光輝。回憶徐敎授畫室中所懸集泰山經石峪的大對：「獨特偏見，一意孤行」，就可知徐氏的性格與他老是說到做，不同流俗，特別是這種爲難民請命的善舉，格外發揮了他廣大的同情心。</p>
<p>除這些畫展外，徐敎授在逗留印度時，曾在加爾各答城和國際大學分別舉行個展一次。加爾各答城的一次畫展，還勞八十高齡的詩翁太戈爾親自來主持揭幕，當然盛況空前。以後，徐敎授更去喜馬拉雅山作一次旅行寫生的壯舉，完成了大構圖「愚公移山」油畫。</p>
<p>據說最近敎育部全國美術委員會請徐敎授擔任常務委員，正在電促徐氏歸國，主持會務呢。</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>服飾幫助心理健康</h3>
<p>— 金光</p>
<p>讀了五月十日「自由談」上瑩女士所作的「我不像個大學生」那篇文章的人，恐怕很少不受感動而對她表同情的吧。在這繁華的都市裏，像瑩女士那樣祇知努力向學，不求衣飾都麗的大學生，委實不易多　。</p>
<p>從樸實的原則上看來，我個人對於瑩女士的主張，是毫無異議的。可是從人情上，從社會習俗上，從心理健康上看起來，我覺得瑩女士的意見是值得提出來檢討一下的。</p>
<p>對於那些專以電燙秀髮，寇丹指甲，奇裝異服和高跟皮鞋作爲「新時代」以及「前進」象徵的女子，我們當然可以一笑置之。可是我們要曉得：（一）人類總是好帬的；（二）社會上各色人等的服飾裝束，雖然沒有明白的規定，可是無形中却也有相當的劃分與區別；（三）孤獨從心理健康上看來是不衛生的。</p>
<p>你到馬路上去，你可以看到這一個是工人，那是一個是娘姨，這一是個學徒，那一個是舞女，這一個是學生，那一個是商人……爲甚麼呢？因爲從他們的服飾與裝束上，無形中是可以辯認出來的。在一帬摩登女子當中，忽然來了一個鄉下裝束的女子，她們會不覺得奇怪嗎？在一群　探當中，忽然來了一個衣衫襤褸形容憔悴的癟三，大家能夠一見如故嗎？恐怕是很難的吧；學校除了是讀書的地方以外，應該也是一個交朋結友（當然不是指酒肉朋友）的地方。爲了服飾的特異犧牲朋友，是不聰明</p>
<p>從前七八歲至十幾歲的女孩子總是梳辮子，婚後的婦婦則打髮髻，無形中也有相當的規定。現在多數的女子雖然都剪了髮，可是頭髮的式樣，往往也隨年齡而不同。一個四五十歲的老太婆而留「童化式」的頭髮，那是比一個三四歲的孩子燙「飛機式」的頭髮一樣不順眼的。爲了髮式的不同而被認爲怪物，因此而與人格格不相合，心中時常感覺不安，這也是不必要的煩惱。</p>
<p>人類是保守的，習俗的改變，髮式的更換，甚至要穿出一件新做的衣服來，往往需要相當的勇氣。起初時常感到不自然，可是日久則安之。我當然不希望瑩女士花了大量的時間與金錢，去改成一個「像大學生」的人；可是在不違背樸實的原則的範圍之內，適應環境，使自己在外表上較像一個大學生，同時不放棄美麗的靈魂，從心理的健康上講，是比較合理的。</p>
<p>我以爲「像大學生」與窮奢極侈是大有區別的，而順眼的外表與美麗的靈魂是可以兼顧的。</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>獨臂車夫</h3>
<p>— 微言</p>
<p>有一天，在一個黃昏的時候，我從公共租界叫黃包車去法租界。因爲要趕去授夜課，遲了恐怕誤時。在一帬車夫爭着討價的聲中，我了一個價錢較低的，忽忙地坐了上去。那曉得走了幾步，忽然發覺那個車夫祇有一隻手拉，另外一邊，是用一條繩子從臂下套在頸上幫忙的。我詫異起來，問他爲甚麼緣故，祇有一隻手。旣然一隻手壞了，爲甚麼還要拉車呢？他見我發生疑問，就一面跑：一面把他的身世告訴我。他說，他從前是當兵的，因爲　經某次戰事，被打壞了一隻手。其後軍隊解散，他就回去鄉下，做些小生意，一家數口，勉強度日。那曉得隔了幾年，第二次戰事又發生了。他被查出從前曾當過兵，打過仗，於是全家蒙難。他獨手抱了幼子逃來上海，旣無本錢，又無專長。他因爲一隻手，所以討價比別人便宜；但他寗願我跑幾次，每天收入，也可以養活父子兩人。我到了下車的時候，我多給了他一點錢，他還於三推讓纔受呢。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>袁紹文把秋海棠送上這家醫院來的時候，雖沒有把自己的眞姓名和秋海棠的眞姓名告訴人家，但那幾位大夫一瞧這麼年輕的人突然在臉上受了如此可怕的刀傷，心裏也就猜定內中必有緣故了。</p>
<p>「這位先生的傷口倒眞是很麻煩的，即使不爛不化膿，也未必沒有瘢痕，而那個眼睛也還大有問題。」那一位戴眼鏡的醫生皺着眉頭說。</p>
<p>同時那女看護把一顆白色的藥片塞進了秋海棠的嘴裏來，但不等她把一盃冷開水湊到他嘴唇邊去，藥片已從病人嘴裏吐出來了。</p>
<p>「這個我不要吃」！他很堅決地說：「大夫，請你們可憐我，給一些安眠藥水喝喝吧」！</p>
<p>「不要這樣，玉琴！我們有話慢慢的說吧」！紹文忙來不及的低下頭去安慰他。</p>
<p>「這顆藥吃下去就可以使你不痛了」！醫生說。</p>
<p>秋海棠却爽快把石眼也閉上了，嘴唇咬得緊緊的。</p>
<p>「老弟，你這是存心怪我啊……」！紹文才說了一句便又嚥住了。「大夫，小姐」，然後回過頭去，改向那位醫生，和站在他對面的女看護說：「能不能請你們暫時出去一會，讓我再向舍弟開導幾句，年輕的人吃了虧總是要負氣的；氣不先平下去，吃藥也是沒有用。對不對」？</p>
<p>醫生笑了一笑，便帶着看護走出去了。</p>
<p>「老弟」，紹文直挺挺地站在秋海棠的床前，也不管他的眼睛有沒有睜開，便用着極誠摯的語氣說：（一〇四）</p>
<h3>救火高射砲隊</h3>
<p>— 李義</p>
<p>最近國際形勢，日趨緊張，戰區日益擴大，美國民眾，自知畏此以往，戰事大有蔓延至新大陸之危險，是以備戰情緒，極爲熱烈。馬州皮士頓城之救火會，爲防患未然計，特組織救火高射砲隊，於救火車之上，裝置高射砲及高射機關槍。將來戰事發生，救火車灌救被炸起火區域時，倘有敵機來襲，則救火高射隊可以應付裕如也。</p>

<h3>卡爾登聽歌記</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>卡爾登臺第三日，戲碼有言小朋之鐵籠山，章逸雲之十三妹，言菊朋罵曹帶長亭，均為精工之作，鐵籠山最重風格今日武生視為畏途，言小朋個子尚高，惜骨幹欠豐，氣度方面，殊有未逮。此劇雖為武生開臉戲，但與武生有別，不以武工見長，側重工架，起　宜穩練，舉止宜大方，一舉一動，一步一躍，有規定尺寸，須妙合章節，盔靠在身，切忌紊亂，矯健靜穆，處處不有失大將威風，氣魄渾厚，加工端肅，白口咬字應分三段。上段咬字用抑音，從沈着中托出，得英銳之氣，以表其威武。中段　純以中氣練成，字眼由憤怒中迸出，以不失鎭靜為原則。末段用衷氣抑落，使韻節凄楚，如此念白，方稱上乘，顧此可與內家語，不足為外行道也。小言此劇，授自丁永　，工架念白，尚屬不差，僅氣白色稍弱耳。十三妹為花旦累工戲，亦以說白身段神情為三要素，逸雲初次登臺，居然頭頭是道，京白　情俱佳，勸婚一塲，嬌嗔薄怒，恰到好處，令人如啖諫果，回味盎然。表情方面，有數處暗合乃姊，想係耳濡目染所致。扮相艷麗，修短適中，　鳳淸聲，有此成績，洵屬不易。大軸罵曹為言菊朋得意傑作，首段「平生志氣…」之原板，「平生」二字高拔，十足譚氏之音。「風雲」二字極見功夫，「風」字有噴口音，「雲」字收得有力，二塲二六「壓當朝」一轉，愈唱愈緊，罷罷罷三字，如雨打芭蕉，乾凈受聽，三塲大段念白，一氣呵成，尤以「酒逢知己千杯少」句，字字向高，咬字淸晰之至。此段念曰，賢如叔岩，猶不免有一二倒字，末句「明知山有虎偏向虎山行」句，「偏」字讀陰平甚正，「昔日裏」快板，韻味雋厚，口勁十足，「　臣當道謀漢朝」倒板，高唱入雲。以下原板，平平未見出色。擂鼓三通，異常圓熟，沈着　練，　　有金石聲，蓋其技授自陳彥衡，自屬不同凡響。綜觀菊朋此劇，唱勝於做，惟幾個下塲身段，猶可看罵曹操罵張遼，眼神臉上都有戲，頗能描寫恃才傲物之彌正平當時情景，嗓雖偏窄，高音尚淸越耐聽，不失　　派中人物也。</p>

<h3>影劇交響曲</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>李綺年第三部作品「風流寡婦」，因為充滿新的刺激的情調，立刻博到大量觀衆熱烈贊美，恢復過去的光榮。本來，藝華當局，計劃攝製「魂斷藍橋」，但恐又以不配合李綺年的個性再失敗了。所以，為媲美「風流寡婦」計，決再攝製一部同樣題材的電影，劇名已經內定「賊美人」，仍由葉逸芳負責編寫，描寫一個交際花出入貴族塲合中。顛倒不少紳士與買辦階級之流，實則正是一個賊，利用偷竊貴重飾物呢！同時「賊美人」的導演，也已內定是「風流寡婦」導演人李萍全倩了</p>
<p>美成公司決定自下月份起，重新開始製片工作，中間一度計劃攝製「洪　嬌」，現已作罷，不過製片工作的計劃還在積極籌備中。為培植新人計，決定起用全部從未上過舞臺或銀幕的新人，目下已有舞女王玲玲周瑾李桂琴等被發掘，初步工作，就是訓練國語，然後排練舞臺劇「帬鶯亂飛」，以增加經騐。至於電影劇本，則請費穆編寫，並負導演的職務。</p>
<p>岳楓自「春風回夢記」完成後，獲到「言情導演」的銜頭，今正在趕攝又一部言情片「碧海靑天」，以便繼「風流寡婦」後在滬光演出。下一部作品，已經決定是「魂斷秋江」，該片女主角，將由袁美雲擔任。</p>
<p>天風劇團，下期將演吳仭之導演的「上海以至于籥下」，說將用各地方言演出。如此，在綠寳劇塲提出文明戲話劇化的口號後，天風卻也跟着提倡話劇文明戲化的主義了！</p>

<p>此事我早想去和王永泰說明揭穿他們的秘密，不如明日我便把這香羅帕為證，去向王永泰迫言其故，勸王永泰早把姦女淫婦處置，別謀良圖。天下多美婦人，何必是？許靖想定主意，就把香羅帕放在抽屜裏，閉目安睡。次日淸早起身，梳洗畢，吃過早餐，便帶了那香羅帕，走到王永泰書房裏來。見王永泰正坐在椅子裏，仰首承塵，若有所思。他就輕輕走進去，立正了身子，叫一聲伯父。王永泰回過臉來，瞧見了許靖。平常時候必要帶着笑容說一聲賢姪請坐，可是今天他卻視而不見，聽而不聞，冷冷地不睬不理。許靖不由一呆；口欲言而　嚅，足將進而　　，許靖眞有這種窘態。但他轉念一想我來做什麼的？不管王永泰的態度如何，我　該忠言直道。也許他別有不快的事情所致吧。於是牠鼓着勇氣，把這塊香羅帕取出，雙手送到王永泰面前桌子上，很沉毅的說道：「伯父聽禀，小姪為了這羅帕，正有一件很重要很秘密的事情，斗瞻向伯父奉禀，盡其忠吿，所謂骨鯁在喉，不得不吐，還請伯父明鑒」。許靖說了這話，料想王永泰必然要向他啟問緣由了，誰知道王永泰對他冷笑了一聲，把手搖搖道：「不必說了，我一切都已知道。」許靖聽了這話，不由一怔，怎麼王永泰都知道了呢？王永泰又接着說道：「明人不做暗事，你是個大丈夫，當如何潔身自愛？不應惑亂本性，大膽妄行。旣然犯了過失，也該自謀悔改，以贖　愆，何必文過飾非，欲　彌露呢？你也不必對我說了。」王永泰說到這話，許靖大驚，知道王永泰已有誤會，自己怎可不辯？遂又說道：「伯父，且待小姪細說原委，自然明白我別無他意，全為伯父計算。」王永泰不待他說畢，又大聲說道：「我早已明白，你又何必多說。你年紀力輕，前途正長，自己好好去做人吧，我這裏留你不下了，何必多言？」王永泰說完這話，一拂衣袖，立起身來，便望外走，大約到衙署中去了。（六一）</p>

<h3>Large Chinese Army Assembles on the Border of Shanxi and Henan to Prevent Japanese Troops from Crossing the River; Fully Safeguarding the Central-Soviet Route and Northwest Key Locations; It is Reported that Chinese Troops Annihilated 3,000 Japanese Soldiers in Two Days of Bloody Battle in Shanxi</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Military News: (1) A portion of the Japanese army that attacked Yuan'an from Dangyang to the north, on the 9th, detoured via Shimachao, Huangmao Cen, and Mao Pingchang to attack the old county and Lu Xitai (north of Yuan'an). They were severely attacked by the Chinese army and were eventually defeated, with hundreds of Japanese soldiers killed. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and retreated. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy and is currently engaged in battle with the Japanese army in the area south of Yuan'an. (2) The Japanese army that invaded westward from Yuanqu was blocked by the Chinese army in the dangerous area from Ban Jianhe to Wufu Jian. The Japanese army was unable to succeed and suffered heavy casualties. (3) The Japanese army that attacked Feng Doukou (west of Jiyuan) invaded Feng Menkou on the morning of the 10th. A contingent of Japanese troops from Yuanqu also turned east to attack Dong Huai, attempting a pincer attack. The Chinese army divided its forces to resist, engaging in bloody battles. (Report from the 11th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The official Central News Agency announced today that the Chinese army launched a counter-offensive on the Shanxi front, ninety miles northwest of Hankou. As of yesterday, it had been fighting fiercely for forty-eight hours, killing 3,000 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army's westward advance from the Pinghan Railway area has failed. Today, a Chinese military official told a reporter from the Associated Press that the Japanese army has concentrated six divisions in the Yellow River area in southern Shanxi and northern Henan, apparently intending to cross the river and attack Luoyang or Xi'an, in order to cut off the supply route from the Soviet Union to Chongqing. Military sources continued to say that the Japanese army took advantage of aircraft and heavy artillery to occupy Yuan'an and Jiyuan, and the Chinese troops formerly stationed in these two cities retreated north to Zhongtiao Mountain. These sources also pointed out that the Chinese army is implementing various plans to frustrate the Japanese army's attempt to cross the Yellow River. In the past, the Japanese army had repeatedly made such attempts, but had not succeeded. These sources emphasized that the Chinese army is determined to defend the Northwest territories where the Sino-Soviet highway is located, and also said that the Japanese offensive in central China is intended to assist the war in southern Shanxi, because the Japanese army has been blocked in Hubei, and Chinese military leaders are now concentrating their efforts to deal with the situation in Shanxi. (Report from the Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Frontline news from southern Shanxi reported that fierce fighting is taking place on the north bank of the Yellow River, with the Japanese army launching a large-scale offensive against the Chinese army defending Zhongtiao Mountain. This battle is of great importance, because the safety of the Chinese army's position in northern China depends on the ability of the Chinese army in Zhongtiao Mountain to hold its ground. Otherwise, the Japanese army will completely control Shanxi Province and the north bank of the Yellow River, and may look west to Xi'an, or cross the Yellow River to the south and cut off the Longhai Railway in Luoyang and Tongguan. In addition to stationing elite troops in Zhongtiao Mountain, the Chinese side has also sent large forces to concentrate in the Yellow River area. It is noted that the Chinese army in Zhongtiao Mountain has been fighting for about four years, repeatedly repelling Japanese troops. The military and the public are now closely watching the development of the battle in southern Shanxi. (Report from Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Military News: (1) A portion of the Japanese army in Lianjiang, north of the Min River, attacked Zhushan (northwest of Lianjiang) on the afternoon of the 8th. They were severely attacked by the Chinese army and retreated with injuries. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to attack Zhushan and continued to pursue the defeated Japanese army, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army near Donghu (four kilometers north of Lianjiang). (2) A large number of Japanese troops reinforced Zhuji. At 4:00 a.m. on the 10th, they advanced to Caota City with a force of four to five thousand, and then divided into three groups to attack southward. One group attacked Jiu Jing Kui Shan and Xida Shan, and was blocked by the Chinese army, and then turned to attack Shi Bi Shan and Huang Jin Ta. Another group attacked Shizitou Gang and Huang Yan Shan Jian, and joined the Japanese troops attacking Huang Ti Ta to attack Shen Zhai to the south. Another group of Japanese troops attacked south via Douzi Yan. The Chinese army is fiercely resisting them. (Report from the 11th)</p>
<p>Shuikou - The Japanese army is besieged in various strongholds on the outskirts of Fuzhou, and dares not attack. The Chinese army is attacking them as opportunities arise. There has been some contact in recent days. (Report from the 11th)</p>
<p>A Certain Place in Southern Anhui - The entire Japanese army that attacked south from Hegang was repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. Xia Tan Town and other places have been recovered by the Chinese army. (Report from the 10th)</p>
<p>A Certain Place in Eastern Zhejiang - The Chinese and Japanese armies are still fighting south of Zhuji. East of the railway, a portion of the Japanese army attacked Zhangjiawu via Shanfeng Bridge and Chenchan Temple yesterday, and was repelled by the Chinese army. West of the railway, the Japanese divided their forces to attack the positions in the area of Wuta Dushan, Hengshan, Yin Xue Shan, Jiu Jing Kui Shan, and Kaokeng Shan. Jiu Jing Kui Shan and Kaokeng Shan were once occupied by the Japanese army, but were counterattacked by the Chinese army and were recaptured. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated from the mountain tops of Jiu Jing Kui Shan and Kaokeng Shan. (Report from the 11th)</p>
<h3>China is Willing to Make Further Sacrifices to Prevent Japan's Southward Advance; Japanese Newspapers Demand an End to the Sino-Japanese War, Which Has Not Elicited the Slightest Response from China</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Recent Japanese attempts to end the Sino-Japanese War and seek peace with Chongqing have not elicited the slightest response from Chongqing. The mood in Chongqing is still as expressed by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in his speech on Saturday night. People here feel that Japan's indirect request for peace is due to its recognition of the hopelessness of conquering China, and that Japan now needs to concentrate its efforts on advancing southward. If the southward advance is successful, Japan can still easily turn around to deal with China. People here say that China has no intention of helping Japan escape its predicament in China, and that because of the real assistance from Britain and the United States, and in order to maintain its long-standing policy of friendship with Britain and the United States, China is willing to make further sacrifices to prevent Japan's southward advance. People here also believe that Chiang Kai-shek's unification of the interests of China, Britain, and the United States is an important explanation of China's current and future foreign policy. According to He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration, in a broadcast to Britain and the United States on April 6, "Our purpose is a common one, the victory we hope for is your victory, and your victory is our victory." It is also believed here that the government's appointment of Guo Taiqi as Foreign Minister is enough to prove this trend, and in the past two weeks, newspapers here have written articles emphasizing the common interests of China, Britain, and the United States, and advocating the ABC policy. (Report from the Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - This morning, the Dagong Bao reported that the first ship of American military supplies and transportation materials is on its way to Chongqing. Chinese experts in the United States are discussing with American officials how much and what kind of supplies the United States will transport to China. A spokesman for the US Embassy told a representative of the Chongqing newspaper that even though Europe has a great need, the quantity of American supplies to China will still be increased. It is also pointed out that in the event that the United States enters the war, the US fleet will not withdraw from the Pacific, because the United States has the ability to operate in both oceans at the same time. (Report from the International News Service, 12th)</p>
<h3>Six Japanese Bombers Bomb the Commercial District of Kunming; Telephone Exchange Suffers Severe Damage</h3>
<p>Kunming - Six Japanese bombers concentrated their bombing near the telephone exchange in Kunming yesterday, causing serious damage to the central commercial district. The Japanese planes appeared at 11:30 a.m. The telephone exchange suffered severe damage. Many small shops nearby were also destroyed. A bank building nearby was also directly hit by a bomb. The building houses the representatives of the British Steel Export Company and the Dodge Motor Company. (Report from the Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Various Circles in Northern Jiangxi Commemorate the Fallen Soldiers</h3>
<p>Shanggao - The headquarters of a certain army group held a memorial service in northern Jiangxi for the soldiers who died in the Battle of Shanggao. The Central Executive Committee, the Supervisory Committee, and the various ministries and departments of the Executive Yuan, as well as the commanders of various war zones, all sent eulogies. It is estimated that more than 10,000 military and political representatives and civilians attended. Commander-in-Chief Luo Zhuoying presided over the meeting and reported on the course of the battle, and encouraged those present to make the determination to sacrifice themselves for the glory of the nation. The atmosphere at the meeting was tragic and solemn. After the meeting, the entire body went to a certain place to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the Martyrs' Cemetery. (Report from the 11th)</p>
<h3>The Sino-Soviet Air Route from Almaty to Moscow Resumes Service on the 5th of This Month; One Flight Each Week; The Entire Journey Takes 23 Hours</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Almaty to Moscow section of the Chongqing-Moscow air route, which had been suspended for a long time, resumed service on the 5th of this month, with one flight each week. The entire journey takes twenty-three hours. According to the Sino-Soviet Aviation Agreement signed in 1937 by the Chinese Ministry of Communications and the Soviet Civil Aviation Administration, the Soviet side was responsible for the Almaty to Moscow section, the Chinese side was responsible for the Chongqing to Hami section, and both sides were jointly responsible for the Hami to Almaty section. However, the Almaty to Moscow section was soon suspended. It was not until the third meeting of the board of directors of the Sino-Soviet Aviation Company in January of this year that the Chinese side's proposal was accepted and it was decided to resume service. (Report from Havas World Telegraph Agency, 11th)</p>
<h3>Lei Yin Inspects Kunming; Inspection Completed</h3>
<p>Kunming - Since arriving in Kunming on the 3rd, Nei Ci Lei Yin has been busy inspecting counties and cities, local teams in various townships, self-government facilities, and national education. He has now completed his official business and is heading west along the Yunnan-Burma Road to inspect the administration of various counties along the route. (Report from the 11th)</p>
<h3>Number of US Troops in Northern China to be Reduced</h3>
<p>Sweden - It has recently been learned that the number of US Marines stationed in northern China is currently 340. By May 20, 70 people will be withdrawn from Beiping and 53 people will be withdrawn from Tianjin to Qinhuangdao. The US military transport ship "Henderson" is heading to Manila. (Report from Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<h3>Hull Asks Senate Not to Restrict the Use of Foreign Vessels</h3>
<p>Washington - US Secretary of State Hull recently sent a letter to the Senate Commerce Committee, urging that the use of US-received ships not be restricted. Major General Silandt of the Shipping Affairs Committee stated at the committee last week that the government intends to use these ships to carry supplies to Britain. (Report from Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>The King of Italy Accompanies the Foreign Minister on a Visit to Albania</h3>
<p>Albanian Capital - After arriving here, King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy summoned General Cadelelo, the commander-in-chief of the Italian garrison, yesterday afternoon for inquiries. The Albanian cabinet then held a state meeting, presided over by Emmanuel himself. Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. Albanian Prime Minister Verlaci also gave a speech, praising the King to the utmost. (Report from Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Rome - Newspapers here yesterday published the news of King Emmanuel's visit to Albania in a prominent position, and also carried dispatches from Tirana, describing the King's visit in detail. The King received Albanian officials and representatives from various regions of Southern Albania, and made inquiries. As for the plan to establish Greater Albania, it has not been mentioned in the newspapers. Newspaper commentaries have stated that the King's first visit to Albania has already conquered the hearts of the Albanian people with his majesty. Muslim women in Tirana also mingled in the crowd to welcome the King of Italy, which is extremely noteworthy. (Report from Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>

<h3>The Mystery of Soviet Russia's Movements</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, Soviet Russia has been regarded by the world as an important stronghold that carries weight on the international stage. In recent days, it seems to have been regarded as the main actor about to perform on the international stage. In fact, apart from signing a neutrality treaty with Japan, which further emphasized its proclaimed policy of peace and its grasped attitude of neutrality in this region with this treaty; apart from announcing a decree prohibiting the transit of foreign weapons, and formally explaining the principle and exceptions in writing regarding the transportation and traffic that has been strictly controlled by the government for many years; apart from Stalin taking over as Chairman of the People's Committee, thereby having the "Supreme Head of State," that is, the one who actually holds the power, personally come to the fore and take control of the regime; all of these things only made the original phenomenon and substance more apparent; there are no new facts to indicate any new direction, new preparation, or any new strategy or action. Therefore, to hastily regard it as "about to perform" is too early, at least for now there is insufficient evidence. However, international telegrams have almost simultaneously transmitted that Soviet Russia is about to help Germany enter the war, and that the period of German-Soviet conflict is not far away. Such communication is naturally not mutually beneficial: such contradictions are not mutually corroborative; however, one cannot lightly dismiss these contradictory exchanges as positively and negatively offsetting each other, equaling zero. Because the intricate growth and decline of the international situation, and the spread and expansion of disturbances, ultimately have objective factors that will make this important stronghold unable to remain on the sidelines for long, and it will eventually perform.</p>
<p>Paying attention to world events, paying attention to Soviet Russia, everyone is eager to know what the future holds; but regarding everything about Soviet Russia's future, even if one attempts to make a definitive judgment, one cannot deeply believe in the accuracy of the judgment. What can be inferred is a mixed bag of opinions, a confusing array of appearances, some of which are possible, some of which are ambivalent and differ in their weight, and some of which are impossible; even this distinction, while still unable to obtain a definitive and accurate conclusion, is still a useful source of information for studying conclusions. For example, in a recent telegram from Chongqing, when Japanese planes attacked Chongqing, they distributed leaflets, using the material that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka embraced Soviet Russian dignitaries when he left Moscow, to clearly indicate that Soviet Russia was friendly to Japan and imply that Soviet Russia was hostile to China. This method of propaganda is what we expected to have the effect of sowing discord and inciting disputes, which we are childish enough to laugh at, so we will not comment on it for now; however, the pro-Japanese and anti-Chinese Soviet Russia that the Japanese side hopes for is impossible in fact. The decisions of Soviet Russia regarding all choices are naturally based on Soviet Russia's interests as the standard. Soviet Russia's territory spans the two continents of Europe and Asia, and it is equally unwilling to abandon either, and equally deeply hates threats. In its Asian part in the East, the only threat from beginning to end comes from Japan; now that China's long-term war has weakened the threat that the Japanese side could impose on Soviet Russia, and China's continued war will inevitably continue to weaken the Japanese side's threat, it is impossible to hope that Soviet Russia will be hostile to China. Regarding Japan, although it has witnessed its power gradually decline, and the opposition with Soviet Russia is no longer on an equal footing; however, before it can confirm that the Japanese side's threat has completely disappeared, it will never slacken its guard; therefore, the statement that it will reduce its Eastern garrison and transfer it elsewhere must be recognized as a great effort, so how could it be possible to be friendly to Japan. The signing of the neutrality treaty with Japan is enough to explain the temporary easing of the state of opposition between the Soviet Union and Japan, and it can also explain that the current Soviet Russia feels that the threat from the West is greater than the threat from the East, or even feels that it is almost impossible to maintain its neutrality on the European side.</p>
<p>Since the main organs of Soviet Russia are in the European part, it is only natural to give priority to covering the European aspect. If it goes beyond the nature of cover and actively goes to war, then siding with Germany or siding with Britain is not necessarily impossible. On the whole: in terms of materials, Great Britain has the richest holdings, and from the Near East to India, Soviet Russia is particularly close at hand, so siding with Germany would be a fatter share. In terms of strategy, Soviet Russia is called a bear but resembles an elephant, Germany resembles a tiger, and Britain is a whale; fighting with the tiger on the mainland may result in self-injury: if it joins forces with the tiger on land to conquer and encroach, the whale will only cry out in vain; therefore, siding with Germany is a cheaper cost. In short, the existence of the possibility that Soviet Russia will side with Germany and oppose Britain cannot be denied. In terms of belief, capitalism and communism are truly incompatible, and communism and Nazism are even more irreconcilable; the two are not only different in distance, communism and Nazism are almost congenitally irreconcilable, while Britain and the Soviet Union are not incompatible. In terms of harm, Germany is militaristic and Britain is democratic; Germany is trying to become a hegemon, while Britain is only uneasy with other countries becoming hegemons; militarism and hegemony on the same continent naturally pose a more serious threat to people. In terms of conflicting interests, there are already latent conflicting interests between Britain and the Soviet Union, but there are no new disputes; if in the Danube River basin, in the Balkan Peninsula, and in the Near East surrounding Turkey in Syria and Iraq, then Germany's every move recently has made the Soviet Union feel pain. In short, Soviet Russia has more reasons to side with Britain and oppose Germany, and it is even more impossible to deny its possibility. Comparing the two things, we compare it not by thinking that Soviet Russia has no doubts about nurturing the tiger and causing future troubles, and thus takes military actions that are beneficial to Germany. How can it be neither friendly nor hostile to Britain and Germany, at least knowing that although there is hostility, it will not directly fight, and it can do something in the cracks, and even get what it wants, as it did last year with the small countries in Northern Europe, come again once, and gain a big win again, is this not what Soviet Russia intends to do? However, the Near East is not comparable to Northern Europe, and there is fundamental doubt as to whether there are cracks for the Soviet Union, and without cracks, it is impossible to get rid of the British-German division and establish a separate army.</p>
<h3>Large Strike at San Francisco Shipyards; Naval Construction Program to be Affected; Police Mobilize to Guard Against Accidents</h3>
<p>Old Yu Shan - Seventeen hundred mechanics at eleven shipyards in the San Francisco Bay went on strike at midnight on Friday. At 6:30 this morning, pickets began to operate. Five hundred police officers have been mobilized to guard against accidents. The police will be prepared at the police station in the industrial area, and special police teams will be dispatched to the shipyards. Police Chief Du Li announced that the workers in the midnight shift will continue to work until they are allowed to stop work. The reason for the strike is that the American Federation of Labor insists on refusing to sign the coast no-strike agreement. Secretary of the Navy Knox, Maritime Commission Chairman Lant, and others have tried to stop the strike, but the American Federation of Machinists, together with the machinists of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, have implemented picketing at the shipyards. This move endangers the US$500 million national defense contracts that the shipyards should fulfill. The content of the contract is to build four cruisers, twenty-seven destroyers, and dozens of other ships. After the pickets came out to patrol, another 15,000 construction workers and coppersmiths will also stop work. A spokesman for the shipwrights and joiners of the American Federation of Labor declared that 1,200 of their workers will pass through the picket line, and boilermakers, coppersmiths, and electricians will also not participate. The spokesman also stated that the agreement not to stop work on national defense contracts made at the West Coast Metal Industry Conference in Seattle last month has not been approved by any union. Oakland police officers are not allowed to take leave on Monday, and special guards will be dispatched to the Xinmuer Shipyard Company. The San Francisco traffic police will still be temporarily replaced by motorcycle team members, so that the traffic police can engage in work related to the strike. It is believed that the police's protection plan is the most detailed since the 1964 San Francisco general strike. At the same time, the machinists of the American Federation of Labor declared, "The police's plan is actually unnecessary, because we will never harass anyone who wants to pass through the picket line." A spokesman for the Shipbuilding Craftsmen's Union said he believed that the US Navy requested the deployment of additional police, and the spokesman added that the Shanghai army side avoided taking any action, and only sent the information it obtained to Washington.

<p>Workers at US General Motors Plants to Go on Strike</p>
<p>Washington - Workers at sixty plants belonging to General Motors Corporation have submitted a request to the company authorities for a salary increase, and have decided to go on strike on Thursday if a satisfactory reply cannot be obtained. The Federal Mediation Committee is trying to mediate. (Report from Havas, 11th)</p>
<h3>US Congress to Take Action on Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>Washington - Senate Investigator Truman threatened that Congress will take action on national defense labor disputes, especially on the Saturday strike at eleven shipyards in San Francisco Bay. These eleven plants have increased their investment to more than US$500 million since signing contracts with the government. Previously, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations failed to negotiate with the shipyard authorities, so they decided to declare a strike. Labor disputes have also occurred at Bethlehem Steel Corporation. The company is currently building four cruisers and twenty-five destroyers. There are other smaller labor disputes, and a total of 38,000 national defense workers are on strike. At the Tieteloe local union, the Automobile Workers' Union declared that 160,000 General Motors workers will go on strike on Thursday unless wages are increased by ten cents per hour.

<h3>Japanese Reports on the Dutch East Indies Actively Preparing for War; Dutch Foreign Minister Visits Australian Authorities</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to a report in the "Asahi Shimbun", the signs that the Dutch East Indies are preparing for war are very obvious. The public must use one day's income each month to pay for war preparation expenses. Government agencies and military agencies have all been painted in colors to prevent air raids. Air-raid shelters have been built everywhere. Although the strength of the army and navy has been strengthened, recruitment is still ongoing. Various wartime economic measures have also been implemented. Special permits must be obtained for all imported goods and exported food. Since the Dutch cabinet members came to the Dutch East Indies from London for a visit, the attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities has become stronger. Therefore, Japanese-Dutch relations are still tense. (Report from Haitong Electric, 12th)</p>

<h3>US Troops Hold Spring Exercises in Honolulu; Approximately 40,000 Troops Participate; The Scale is Extremely Large and Unprecedented</h3>
<p>Honolulu - Fourty-thousand, an unprecedentedly large number of Hawaii-based troops, were ordered to disperse at midnight to conduct the US Army's 1941 spring exercises to test the island's important defenses in the most serious hypothetical situation (i.e., simultaneous attacks by hypothetical enemies from both the Pacific and Atlantic). Army Commander Lieutenant General Short instructed the troops that preparations for testing the defenses should begin immediately. In the early morning, infantry and other troops riding in the latest-style lightning-war vehicles moved to the batteries defending Wahu Island, preparing to take over the temporarily assigned positions. Army officials declared that the content of the exercise was a hypothetical attack on the United States by enemies from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, and that enemy ships were operating near the Hawaiian Islands. Regarding this issue, it will be assumed that there has been a period of tension for several months, and then a public break will occur. Other news about the exercise will be kept strictly confidential due to military reasons. General Short will serve as a judge and will normally guide the various participating troops in the exercise. During the exercise, Hawaii will be completely blacked out on May 20. (Report from the Associated Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>US Congressman Dingkham Attacks the President; Claims that Key Members of the Executive Branch Advocate US Entry into the War</h3>
<p>Washington - As the historic debate over authorizing the US President to seize foreign vessels in the United States is about to take place, Massachusetts Republican Congressman Dingkham declared that all cabinet members and the President's "entourage" are now advocating US entry into the war. After finishing his remarks, Dingkham criticized President Roosevelt, saying that Roosevelt would ask Congress to pass a declaration of war for the United States.

<h3>South American Representatives Visit Washington to Discuss Fleet Cooperation; If Various Nations Can Unite, Naval Strength Would Be Quite Considerable</h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - The naval commanders of eleven South American countries, invited to Washington, will provide an opportunity for the countries of the Americas to mutually discuss the defense of the Western Hemisphere. According to a Navy Department announcement, the purpose of the invitation is to promote goodwill and observe the recent developments of the U.S. Navy. However, it is also believed that the cooperation of American fleets to defend against foreign threats will be discussed. The invited countries include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. This marks the first time in world history that naval commanders from so many countries have visited the United States, coinciding with America's assumption of the world's greatest naval power, which will be used to protect the two oceans of the world. Currently, the majority of the naval force is stationed in the Pacific. As long as the British Navy remains intact, the eastern edge of the New World will be safe. However, if this external defense were to weaken, the United States would feel great anxiety. This is the main reason why the government is advocating for aid to Britain. Therefore, the unity and cooperation of the American navies is a crucial plan. Although the armies of Central and South American countries are weak, their combined strength should not be underestimated. They have a total of five battleships (two each from Argentina and Brazil, and one from Chile). There is a strong trend in the U.S. Congress to cooperate with the navies of the United States and other American countries for mutual benefit. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The U.S. State Department issued a statement last night regarding the speeches of Welles and Argentine Navy Chief of Staff Admiral Guisasola. Welles, in his speech at the banquet welcoming the naval chiefs of Central and South American countries, stated that this grand gathering demonstrates the determination of American countries to cooperate. Guisasola, in his response, emphasized that when the international situation is turbulent, it is meaningful and valuable for the countries of the Western Hemisphere to openly express their attitudes. He also stated that the American republics share a spirit of democracy and history, and naturally have a sense of concern for each other's interests. (Haitong, 12th)</p>

<h3>Japan Can Never Conquer China, Observes Philippine Newspaper</h3>
<p>MANILA - The "Manila Daily Bulletin" today published an editorial commenting on the recent admission by the "Japan Times and Advertiser" and the "Hochi Shimbun" that Japan cannot conquer China by force. It believes that Japan is gradually becoming more realistic, but it is still far from openly admitting failure. The editorial states, "Whether standing from an individual, group, or military standpoint, the Chinese are waiting for the coming change with their inherent personality, as they have now heard the Japanese talking about withdrawing a very large portion of their troops. The Chinese are now waiting for an opportunity to destroy the weak invaders left on the front lines at any time." It also says, "The Chinese believe that the war is in their favor, as U.S. aid to China has increased. The Chinese are now hoping for the arrival of a large number of aircraft and tanks to enhance their military strength. How should the Chinese interpret the Japanese admission that the Japanese army in China feels weak due to being dispersed?" The editorial concludes, "Japan is now beginning to bargain in this situation, and they will find that China is not an easy customer to deal with." (United Press, 12th)</p>

<h3>Johnson to Leave Chongqing Tomorrow; Will Meet Gauss in Hong Kong; Gauss Expected to Arrive in Chongqing Around the 21st</h3>
<p>CHONGQING (Reuters) - According to reliable sources, the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to China, Gauss, is expected to arrive in Chongqing by plane around May 21 via Hong Kong. The newly appointed Deputy Commander of the U.S. Air Force in the Philippines, Brigadier General Clagett, is also expected to arrive here soon with his adjutant. Johnson, who has been recently transferred to Australia as minister, is scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 14th. Accompanying him are Major McHugh, naval and air attache, and Mr. Eils, embassy secretary who is transferred to work in Shanghai. It is heard that Johnson and Gauss will meet in Hong Kong. Generalissimo Chiang and his wife hosted a farewell banquet for Johnson on the 10th. During the banquet, Chiang stood up and gave a speech, emphasizing that China and the United States have the same interests, and that the early provision of effective assistance by the United States would mean nothing less than the rapid defeat of Japan. Chiang also mentioned the peace proposals published in the Japan Times and Advertiser, saying that these proposals clearly revealed Japan's opposition to the United States' plan. As the Allied nations provide China with military and economic assistance, they can leave Japan to China without having to send naval and land forces to China. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>CHONGQING - Today, all Chinese newspapers prominently published that the Australian cabinet has, in principle, approved the exchange of ambassadors with China. The Ta Kung Pao elaborated on this news, saying that the center of world affairs has gradually shifted from the Atlantic to the Pacific, with the United States, China, and Australia on its shores. The exchange of diplomatic representatives between China and Australia will greatly contribute to the joint defense against their common enemy and the consolidation of the Pacific situation. Liu Shishun, Director of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, may be appointed as the Chinese minister to Australia, but this information cannot be confirmed yet.

<h3>Severe Damage to British Parliament; Westminster Abbey Suffers Calamity; Thirty-Three German Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>LONDON - The German High Command claims that German cities such as Berlin have been bombed in residential areas during the past few nights by British aircraft, so German troops launched a fierce attack on London on Saturday and Sunday in retaliation. That night, the British Houses of Parliament and Westminster Hall were hit by bombs, causing considerable damage. The opposite Westminster Abbey also caught fire. The debating chamber of the House of Commons was destroyed and may not be usable until rebuilt. The Chief Clerk of the House of Lords was reportedly killed while supervising the fire brigade. It is feared that two others have also perished. Finally, through the efforts of other staff throughout the night, the flames were extinguished, and important archives were preserved. The magnificent roof of Westminster Hall was pierced by bomb holes, and much of the interior was damaged. This hall, without pillars, was built in 1097 and is the largest hall in the world. Although the Parliament clock tower was also bombed, only a small part of the clock was slightly damaged, so this world-famous clock continues to tell the time. The Westminster Abbey sacristy, the best model of British medieval architecture, has suffered a calamity, but the entire structure of the Abbey remains intact. Parts such as the royal tombs have not been damaged. An architect stated that the most architecturally valuable parts of the Abbey fortunately still exist. Although the roof built in the 19th century was destroyed by the bombing, exposing the Abbey to the sky, it is not irreparable. The British Museum was hit by a bomb and caught fire. Fortunately, most of the treasures in the Museum had already been moved to a safe place, so the loss was relatively small. A Reuters reporter described the state of London after the attack, saying that on Sunday, London was covered in ash, like black willow catkins flying in the air. Although the enemy carried out a major destruction at night, the price was not small, sacrificing thirty-two bombers and their pilots. The reporter toured the British capital in the morning, and several places were shrouded in black smoke. Leather shoes, black ash, and dust fell on the streets, staining my clothes. Flames could still be seen inside the houses along the road, and fire brigades were still working hard everywhere. Bomb fragments were visible everywhere in the road, proving how many bombs had fallen. However, vehicles were still running smoothly, and buses were running continuously, although sometimes detouring, traffic was not interrupted. This is a symbol of the Londoners' determination to carry on as usual. Looking into the distance, the two tall towers of Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's Cathedral still stand majestically in the clouds. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>LONDON - There were two air raid alerts in the London area before midnight last night, lasting a very short time. On Saturday night, British night fighters shot down nineteen German bombers, and anti-aircraft guns also shot down four. A British aircraft chased an enemy aircraft to the Dutch coast and destroyed two of them in a matter of minutes. Another British aircraft shot down three enemy aircraft single-handedly. The courage of British aircraft in combat can be seen from this. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>British Night Fighters Highly Successful; Many Attacking German Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>LONDON - British night fighters and anti-aircraft guns shot down another seven German planes last night until this morning. Counting those shot down in the previous few days, the British have shot down more than 160 German planes in the eleven days of May so far. Last night and this morning, many parts of Britain were attacked by German planes. As a result, four German planes were shot down by British night fighters and three were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. It is said that bombs fell in 40 places in Britain, but none developed into intense bombing. London experienced three air raid alerts yesterday, but was not bombed. Londoners waited from dusk until dawn for enemy aircraft to repeat the blitzkrieg they had carried out the night before. It is heard that bombs fell in the East Anglia region, the southwest, southeast, northeast, and northwest coastal regions, inland counties, South Wales, and northeast England last night, but the casualties and losses were small. Small teams of German planes flew over the coastal airspace three times shortly before dusk, shortly after midnight, and after dawn, attempting to attack London, but were repelled. It is said that only one German plane flew into the British capital last night. Aviation experts believe that the German group's scattered air raids last night may have been testing the techniques and nature of British night fighters to avoid huge losses in the future. After all, on Saturday, Germany lost 33 aircraft in one night. According to general estimates, this number represents 10% of the German planes that attacked Britain that night. And experts believe that if so many could be shot down every night, this percentage will cause the Germans to give up night raids. British experts also say that the special achievements of the British Air Force in moonlit air combat may force German aircraft groups to limit large-scale moonlit blitzes and change their strategy, relying on dark nights that are difficult to observe. At the same time, experts hope that British night fighters will continue to improve and achieve greater success, and predict that if German planes launch another large-scale air raid on a night with a full moon, 50 German planes can be shot down in one night. It has already been confirmed by British aviation authorities that British night fighters and anti-aircraft guns shot down seven German planes. Although only one German plane was seen over London last night, London suffered an unprecedented bombing on Saturday night and Sunday morning. The British House of Commons debating chamber was destroyed, and part of the roof of Westminster Abbey was bombed. The famous Big Ben was also damaged, but it has not stopped ticking. The sky this morning is cloudy and overcast, the moon is full, and the stars are orange, which is most suitable for the German planes' blitz. All air defense workers, firefighters, ambulances, service personnel, paramedics, police, hospital staff, and other personnel performing defense duties are standing on the streets in preparation, and the underground air raid shelters are filled with exhausted citizens. The air raid from Saturday night to Sunday morning was no less severe than the famous "Wednesday Blitz" half a week ago, but the scope was not as wide as that night. German aircraft groups have rarely carried out large-scale air raids for two consecutive nights. This may be because a large number of bombers are being used in the Balkans and Africa. However, ordinary Londoners know that cities such as Plymouth and Liverpool have been subjected to several nights of heavy bombing and are preparing for this type of attack. Yesterday, large crowds of people gathered in the market streets, staring blankly at the rubble and bomb craters of their bombed houses, or watching firefighters spray water on smoking houses with water hoses, or searching for machine gun bullets and shell casings that fell during the moonlit air battle as souvenirs. The air raid on Saturday night left countless wounds, small rivers and piles of charred grass caused by extinguishing incendiary bombs, 30-foot-deep craters, and houses that looked as if they had been cut in half by a knife. Among the houses hit by bombs were four hospitals, but the air raid shelters in each hospital were very well equipped, so only two patients and one nurse were killed by the bombs. Among the historical buildings, one of London's most famous churches was destroyed by fire. Observers estimate that 33 German planes were destroyed on Saturday night, accounting for about 10% of the total strength of the German aircraft group that night. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>BERLIN - Responsible authorities in Berlin announced last night that German aircraft groups had carried out retaliatory bombings of the British Isles the night before, and many air defense sites in Britain had been bombed, causing large fires. The losses in Peterborough were particularly severe. The buildings at Lulworth airfield were completely destroyed, and 47,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Fort Hill airfield (it was not specified whether aircraft were destroyed). Also, during the German attack on Maranta on Saturday, a large British Sunderland seaplane was destroyed. In addition, hundreds of aircraft participated in the retaliatory bombing of London on Saturday, dropping bombs for a total of six hours. The largest fires broke out between Waterloo Bridge and Victoria Docks. Furthermore, 29,800 tons of merchant ships in the North Atlantic have been sunk in recent days. Yesterday, another 30,000 tons of British ships were sunk, bringing the total to 110,200 tons in three days. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>British Planes Raid Major German Cities; Drop Large Quantities of Incendiary and Explosive Bombs</h3>
<p>LONDON - The Air Ministry Information Office said that the British air raid on Hamburg on Saturday night was fierce and effective. Pilots reported that Hamburg had suffered enormous damage throughout the city. When British planes attacked, there were no clouds in the sky and the moon was shining brightly, so the ground targets were clearly visible. The British Air Force repeatedly dropped large quantities of incendiary bombs and explosive bombs in the midst of a fiery network, and the industrial and dock areas were almost completely bombed again, causing great fires. Incendiary bombs continued to be dropped, and fires were also reported elsewhere. British bombardiers had no trouble finding factory targets. Warehouses and railway tracks were repeatedly hit by explosive bombs, and a shipyard building submarines also caught fire. The flames reached the sky and seemed impossible to extinguish. Four enemy aircraft that took off to intercept were destroyed, and at least two were damaged. Also, the Air Ministry announced that a large group of British bombers attacked Hamburg's ships and industrial areas on Saturday night, causing significant damage and large fires. Other British planes attacked Bremen, Emden, Rotterdam, Berlin, and enemy ships. One enemy warship was hit, and two supply ships were damaged. British bombers and fighter aircraft engaged in air combat with the enemy under the bright moonlight. Many enemy aircraft were hit by bullets and injured. Seven British bombers were missing. Also, British coastal aircraft attacked enemy ships, docks, and oil refineries in the port of Le Havre, causing fires in many places. Many dock buildings were damaged. Other coastal aircraft attacked ships off the coasts of Holland and Denmark. None of the coastal aircraft that carried out the attack were lost. Also, the German communique stated, "Hamburg was bombed by a large group of British planes on Saturday night, causing fires in many places and significant damage. Three civilians were killed and wounded. A small number of British planes flew to the outskirts of Berlin. Night fighters shot down eight British planes. In the North African sector, the fighting in the Tobruk area was limited to artillery shelling between the two sides." (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>BERLIN - According to responsible authorities here, British air forces have attacked Bremen, Hamburg and Berlin for four consecutive nights. None of the bombed areas have military targets. The seaside resorts of both cities have also been bombed twice. In Bremen, children's clinics, women's clinics, homes for the mute and the operating room of a municipal hospital were all hit, causing many casualties. In retaliation, the German air force bombed London heavily on Saturday night, setting fires everywhere, which could be seen from 100 kilometers away. German submarines sunk 50,000 tons of British ships in the Atlantic on the 8th and 9th and then sunk another 30,000 tons of British ships yesterday, for a total of 110,020 tons of British goods sunk in three days.

<h3>Wartime Dutch East Indies-U.S. Trade Still Maintains a Surplus; U.S. Needs Raw Materials from the Region for National Defense</h3>
<p>BATAVIA - Although the Dutch East Indies has purchased a large quantity of military supplies from the United States, it is still able to maintain a trade surplus of US$100,508,000. This figure is based on calculations during the financial period from January to November 1940. This is an extraordinary achievement during wartime. This is due to the United States' need for raw materials produced in the Dutch East Indies, which are necessary for the U.S. defense program. The prices of goods such as tin, rubber, and quinine have not changed since the recent world depression. Producers and manufacturers at the time agreed to equalize prices and profits to maintain prices. This is the current standard for the Dutch, which can protect their markets without unduly oppressing foreign manufacturers. It is expected that at the end of 1941, the Dutch East Indies will have a commercial surplus balance of US$20,000,000 in the United States. As of December 1, 1940, the total amount of U.S. imports from the Dutch East Indies was US$148,353,000, while the total amount of Dutch East Indies imports from the United States during the same period was US$47,508,000, of which US$34,000,000 was for "manufactured goods." Authorities acknowledge that the majority of these manufactured goods are military supplies. In the future, the trade balance will probably remain the same, but the Dutch East Indies' credit in the United States may increase slightly. The Dutch East Indies budget has stipulated the purchase of additional military and aviation supplies, but the United States' purchase of necessary raw materials from the Dutch East Indies must also increase dramatically. Not long ago, a notice was issued to importers, prohibiting certain products, such as American-made cigarettes, toothpaste, and certain types of American soap and tinplate that are considered not essential for defense. The prohibition of these goods will be lifted or significantly changed. Previously, the tinplate imported into the Dutch East Indies came from Wales, but now, due to shipping difficulties and reduced British exports, the Dutch East Indies' required tinplate will have to be supplied by the United States. Therefore, the ban on tinplate will soon be lifted. Economic experts expect that the same will be done for other manufactured goods that are produced in the United States and were previously imported into the Dutch East Indies. The United States has refused to grant the Dutch East Indies a gold credit to purchase goods covered by the notice totaling approximately 10 million Dutch guilders. Other luxury goods, such as cigarettes and soap, total approximately 2 million. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Hoover Urges America to Stay Out of War; German Report Claims British Ambassador to US Actively Seeking Aid for Britain</h3>
<p>New York - Former President Hoover, in a radio address to the nation yesterday morning, urged the United States to stay out of the European war, stating that America is not yet prepared enough to participate in the war, and the public is not united. However, he said the US should continue to aid Britain, as Americans have complete sympathy for their brave resistance. If the US remains neutral, it can extract war materials to provide to Britain, thus the US's non-belligerent status is actually beneficial to aiding Britain. He also advised the nation to face the transitional period of the war with calm consideration, thought, and reason. Hoover also opposed the United States' inadvertent entry into the war, as it would inevitably lead to attacks on German submarines and aircraft, which would require extensive overseas naval and air bases and the deployment of an expeditionary force, necessitating preparations for a long-term war. (United Press Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>New York - Former President Hoover recently delivered a radio address here, discussing the British issue, stating that if the country implements naval escorts, it will be drawn into the vortex of war. It is indeed a fact that the country is not fully prepared militarily or industrially. However, the country is the world's leading power, and Germany cannot deceive it by claiming it lacks preparation. When necessary, the country can train millions of troops and manufacture unparalleled weapons, and will never be defeated. As for the current situation, although the country must deal with "painful facts," the Axis powers and the country have not yet formally engaged in combat. If the US wants to supply Britain with as much military equipment as possible, it is best not to get involved in the vortex of war. Direct participation in the war would not be beneficial to either Britain or the US. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The semi-official newspaper "Political Foreign Correspondence" recently published an editorial criticizing the activities of British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Halifax, stating that US President Roosevelt will soon deliver a speech addressing the issue of more effective US aid to Britain. Halifax is currently actively working to arrange Roosevelt's speech in advance, and the expansion of US aid to Britain only increases the risk of the US being drawn into the war. In order to obtain more US aid, Halifax is even participating in US political activities to win support for the aid policy. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>London - The Archbishop of Canterbury, in a speech at the second session of the Religious Conference yesterday, stated that the primary purpose of Britain's current great struggle is to eradicate this entrenched evil force and liberate the countries currently trapped in slavery. After the war, humanity should be able to rest and establish a more beautiful civilized order than the one currently being destroyed. Humanity has now lost its way, lacks self-confidence, and disrespects God. The misuse of science and machinery has created the problem of emphasizing machinery over humanity.

<p>Moscow - At the end of 1940, the Iraqi government repeatedly suggested to the Soviet government through its ambassador to Turkey that diplomatic relations be established between the two countries. The Iraqi government also deeply hoped that upon the establishment of diplomatic relations, the Soviet government would simultaneously issue a declaration recognizing the independence of Arab countries (including Iraq). The Soviet government believed that it could not make the issuance of a declaration a condition for the establishment of diplomatic relations. The Soviet government responded to the Iraqi side based on this point, and the negotiations were interrupted. On May 3, 1941, the Iraqi government again suggested to the Soviet Union the establishment of diplomatic relations, but this time it did not make the Soviet Union's recognition of Arab countries a condition. At this point, the Soviet government accepted the Iraqi government's suggestion to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries. (TASS Dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>Turkey Not Pleased to Welcome Iraqi Minister of Defense</p>
<p>The Iraqi Minister of Defense, Shukat, has been visiting the Turkish capital for several days. The Turkish government is not very pleased with Shukat's visit, as the Turkish government has not yet formally recognized al-Gaylani's cabinet. However, Turkish dignitaries cannot easily refuse Shukat, as Turkey, given its position, has the Sa'dabad Pact with Iraq on the one hand and an alliance with Britain on the other. It could have mediated the British-Iraqi conflict, but the Iraqi government is colluding with the Axis powers. The reason why Turkey is keeping silent about Shukat's visit is precisely this.

Although British troops cannot carry out major operations due to the heat, they are still harassing enemy troops. Reports continue to come in of the capture of enemy soldiers in the Tobruk and Sollum sectors, causing damage to the enemy. A large detachment of Italian troops engaged in defensive works under the protection of armored vehicles was attacked by British troops yesterday. By the time the British armored vehicles launched their attack, the engineering team had been strafed, with many casualties and several taken prisoner. The morale of Italian troops in Abyssinia has been affected by repeated attacks from South African air forces and patrols. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Franco-German Cooperation Negotiations Have Not Yet Reached Significant Decisions; Reports of French Navy Preparing to Resist US</h3>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the Franco-German negotiations, German Foreign Ministry personnel only stated that the negotiations have not yet ended. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Vichy - According to unconfirmed reports yesterday, French Deputy Prime Minister Admiral Darlan may have negotiated with Chancellor Hitler on Friday regarding the issue of Franco-German cooperation. The report stated, "Darlan met with a most important German figure at an undisclosed location." The tone of the report seemed to indicate that Darlan had met Hitler in person. It is claimed that the two had a mutual discussion on the entire scope of Franco-German relations. Darlan has been conducting talks with German authorities repeatedly over the past week. He left Paris for elsewhere on Friday. Observers here recalled that in December of last year, Darlan also secretly went to Beauvais to meet with Hitler and review Darlan's actions. He had lunch with German Ambassador to Paris Abetz on Wednesday, during which the two signed a temporary agreement stipulating that German forces would shorten the occupied area of the French coast and relax the restrictions between the occupied and unoccupied zones. At the same time, it was reported that Head of State Pétain was leaving Antibes and returning to Vichy. He is expected to arrive today to meet with US Ambassador to France Leahy. (United Press Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Associate Minister of the Cabinet Admiral Darlan is currently in Paris conducting important negotiations with the German occupation authorities. He can return here tomorrow. According to political figures, the content of the negotiations is still unknown. There has been no mention of reports that France has reduced its military expenses for Germany. As for the various rumors published in foreign newspapers, the authorities here do not comment, only stating that the reports are often contrary to the facts and not credible.

However, he maintained close contact with his cabinet members while passing through cities such as Antibes, Cannes, and Nice. Associate Minister of the Cabinet Admiral Darlan, who is in Paris conducting talks with the German authorities, telegraphed the progress of the talks at any time. It is learned that Marshal Pétain is very satisfied with the results of the talks in Paris. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Sourek - According to news from Berlin, the new diplomatic victory expected by Berlin has not been achieved. A Basel newspaper, in a Berlin dispatch, stated that Vichy has not yet made a significant decision on restoring cooperation in the manner expected by the German side. Furthermore, the scheduled return of German Ambassador to Turkey Papen can also be seen as an indication that Turkey's development is different from what the German government's mouthpiece calls an established fact. The reshuffling of key Spanish government officials is considered to be a concrete sign of the conflict between Franco and Foreign Minister Suñer over Spanish policy. However, the German government naturally refers to Franco's actions as purely domestic affairs. A Basel newspaper, in a Budapest dispatch, stated that the border negotiations between Foreign Minister Ciano and Pavelic, the head of the German-backed Croatian state, in Zagreb, are also facing obstacles. In addition to gaining Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia also wants part of Dalmatia, which Italy is unwilling to give up. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>London (Reuters Special Correspondent from Southern England): The British 1st Armoured Division, along with 50,000 soldiers, recently conducted a four-day simulated battle on Salisbury Plain, practicing the repelling of a German landing force. The mechanized division acting as the enemy, comprised of several regiments of British cavalry now mechanized, imitated Nazi landing tactics but were flanked by British heavy tanks and ultimately succumbed, retreating into the sea. The combat scenario was exceptionally realistic, with army liaison aircraft, wireless radio cars, and military telephones all participating in the exercise, ensuring rapid action. General Sir Alan Brooke, Commander-in-Chief of Home Forces, and Major General Martel, Commander of the British Armoured Corps, both observed the exercise on-site. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the European War (54): The Quelling of American Labor Strikes</h3>
<p>This spring, labor strikes erupted one after another in major industrial areas of the United States, dragging on for over two months and involving tens of thousands of workers. National defense industries, including Ford Motor Company, Bethlehem Steel Corporation, Bendix Aviation Corporation, Los Angeles Shipbuilding, US Navy shipyards, army ordnance factories, DuPont munitions plants, General Motors, and thirty other companies, were forced to cease operations. These companies had accepted orders from the government for munitions and military equipment totaling $450 million, accounting for one-third of all military supplies, and were temporarily unable to deliver.</p>
<p>The reasons for the factory strikes can be summarized as follows: First, wage increases. Workers speculated that the cost of living would continue to rise and demanded that employers sign wage adjustment agreements to prepare for future conditions. Economists warned that wage increases would lead to inflation, ultimately reducing workers' actual benefits, but the workers remained unconvinced.</p>
<p>Second, workers aimed to secure the legal status of labor unions, believing that if they did not solidify their position during this critical period, they would fade into obscurity once peace was restored.</p>
<p>Third, internal strife within unions. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the American Federation of Labor (AFL) were the two major labor groups in the United States, long engaged in a rivalry for dominance. Within the CIO, those involved in the national defense industry largely viewed the small number of communist elements in the union as a thorn in their side, which had to be expelled.</p>
<p>As the labor strikes spread and intensified, French opinion was ablaze. The chairman of the Chamber of Deputies' Judiciary Committee, Mr. Sonnen, in a fit of fury, advocated electrocuting enemies hiding in factories. Secretary of War Stimson also raised his gravelly voice, proposing sending troops to clear out the troublemakers in the factories.</p>
<p>Most comical was the suggestion of Air Force General Brett, who advocated sending military aircraft to stage a demonstration over the striking factories, to make the strikers aware of the importance of their mission and thereby induce them to be cautious. Congressman Dies angrily denounced the communists as "jackals," and now, more enraged than ever, demanded the elimination of all red workers. One officer in Washington even vowed that the first target of the US Army would not be the enemy, but the country's own people. Meanwhile, public opinion polls showed that approximately 72% of the nation supported using forceful measures to quell the labor strikes in national defense industries.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, seeing this situation, recognized that the labor-management issue required active handling. After careful consideration, he issued an order at the end of March to establish the National Defense Mediation Board, as the highest-level body to mediate labor disputes. This board consisted of eleven members, including three representatives of the public: University of Wisconsin President Dykstra (who served as chairman), University of North Carolina President Graham, and New York lawyer Davis; four representatives of labor: CIO President Murray, United Mine Workers Secretary-Treasurer Kennedy, AFL Secretary-Treasurer Meany, and Railway Labor Executives' Association Chairman Harrison; and four representatives of management: US Rubber Company Director Tewksbury, New Jersey Standard Oil Company Chairman Teagle, publishing magnate and Washington Post publisher Meyer, and American-Hawaiian Steamship Company Chairman Lagem.</p>
<p>Secretary of Labor Perkins was eager for someone to take on this difficult task. Upon hearing the news of the establishment of the National Defense Mediation Board, she declared that her department's existing arbitration board would temporarily step aside, providing considerable convenience to the new board. The scope of the commission established by President Roosevelt, according to his instructions, was divided into (1) negotiating agreements, (2) conducting arbitration, and (3) gathering public opinion. If the commissioners encountered difficult or unresolved issues, they could submit them to the President for a final decision. In general, this organization and…</p>
<p>…was similar to the War Labor Board established by President Wilson during the First World War. However, before the board could begin its work, a minor hiccup arose. Secretary of Labor Perkins had not yet asked them to mediate any labor disputes, labor leader Hillman had gone away to convalesce, and President Roosevelt was vacationing on the Florida coast. Without a leader, progress was difficult.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox remained in the capital. They seized the opportunity and gently urged the workers to return to the factories and resume work. While some workers affiliated with the CIO complied, most were exacting regarding the conditions for returning to work, making them difficult to appease. Finally, Perkins submitted four strike cases from New Mexico to the Mediation Board for resolution. Chairman Dykstra, upon receiving this task, promptly convened a meeting of the entire commission to discuss a plan of action.</p>
<p>Indeed, where there's a will, there's a way. They first quelled the brewing labor dispute at the Cyclops plant, followed by resolving the forty-day-long strike at the Vanadium Corporation. The labor-management disputes at the Tube Turns Electric and Harvill Aircraft Die Casting companies were also settled. In just three short days, they announced that the majority of factories would immediately resume operations first, and discuss conditions later. This was their initial victory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, statistics also demonstrate that the labor strikes that had been prevalent in the United States were already on the decline. For example, in the week of April 1st to 7th of this year, the number of strikes in national defense factories had decreased from forty to twenty-seven, and the number of striking workers had also decreased from 47,000 to 40,000. There are currently 36 million workers in factories across the country who are still working as usual, so the outlook for the labor strikes is largely optimistic.</p>

<h3>Inexorable Decline of Imported Rice Prices</h3>
<p>The imported rice market continued its downward trend yesterday. Not only was the spot market affected by the impact of 50,000 bags of Hong Kong rice arriving at parity prices, but the near-term Inghwa brand also showed weakness due to contracted exchange rates, low production, and smooth shipping. New arrivals of spot Inghwa rice were doubly pressured, falling to 149 yesterday, a drop of 6-7 yuan compared to Saturday. April-May shipment rice fell to 143-144 yuan. No. 1 Saigon, for shipments of late April and early May, traded heavily at 143-144 yuan, reaching a high of 145.5 yuan, currently at 141 yuan. Broken rice fell from 114.5 yuan to 111 yuan, a decline of 3-5 yuan in each case. Spot prices initially fell, then rose, before continuing to decline in the afternoon, all down 3-5 yuan compared to last weekend. In addition to the weak sentiment from the previous day, the market also reacted to the arrival of 50,000 bags from Hong Kong and reports that a second batch of parity-priced Inghwa rice and the first batch of parity-priced Kwong rice were being negotiated for shipment, while rice stocks in Shanghai were steadily increasing. Consequently, the market immediately plummeted 3-6 yuan at the opening. Subsequently, due to the efforts of major players to rally the market, prices rebounded 1-2 yuan in the afternoon, but were still suppressed by the emergence of floating supply, with early morning prices falling to 116-117 yuan, rising to 120 yuan in the afternoon, before falling again to 116-117 yuan. A total of 8,000 bags of various rice types and 1,000 tons of Inghwa rice were traded throughout the day.</p>
<p>While the arrivals of thick and thin japonica rice and glutinous rice were still limited, sales had yet to improve significantly. Thus, supply and demand were relatively balanced, and market prices showed little fluctuation. Specifically, Hsinchu japonica rice was priced at 138 yuan, Kunshan japonica rice at 135-136 yuan, secondary at 133 yuan, early and late southern Hong Kong rice at 132-133 yuan, original packaging at 137-138 yuan, and glutinous rice at 117-118 yuan. Glutinous Rong rice was not traded.</p>
<h3>Flour Lacks Support, Follows the Downward Trend of the Rice Market</h3>
<p>The current situation in the imported flour market is once again trending downwards, influenced by the declining rice prices. Genuine demand from customers has suddenly become lukewarm, and floating holders, seeing the unfavorable trend, have been actively selling off at lower prices, causing the market to decline rapidly. Golden Dragon brand Kan flour fell again to 31.2 and 31.5 yuan, and foreign Battery brand flour was priced at 31.4-31.5 yuan, with nearly 10,000 bags traded. The situation stabilized somewhat in the afternoon as the rice market rebounded, and genuine demand from merchants increased slightly, briefly increasing buying interest and pushing prices up by 2-3 jiao. Market prices fluctuated, rising and falling in line with the rice market. The flat-priced flour from Chinese factories remained unchanged, and the factory price of 29 yuan is unlikely to fall further.</p>
<p>Wheat trading was extremely quiet, with market trading virtually non-existent. Both Japanese and Chinese factories were not actively buying, waiting for the new wheat crop to come to market before deciding on a strategy. The price of old Shanshi wheat was reportedly still between 47 and 48 yuan, but no formal trading has taken place.</p>
<h3>Spot Cake Trading Disappears</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous oilcake market faced an unfavorable environment for bulls, causing prices for various types of cakes to decline again. Transactions on the trading floor have been decreasing. Yesterday, a total of 2,000 bags of spot corn and 100 tons of corn futures were traded. Old Saigon corn was priced at 32 to 31 yuan, new corn at 33.3 to 32.5 yuan, Dutch yellow corn at 34.5 to 35 yuan, with contracts for delivery between April 10th and early May at 63.5 yuan, and white corn at 33 to 33.5 yuan. Spot trading in bean cake was non-existent, with only speculative futures trading. Over 30,000 pieces of Sang Kee cake were traded, with contracts for delivery in late May at 20.06 to 20.3 yuan, and contracts for delivery in early June at 21.08 to 21.01 yuan. One thousand pieces of Yuan Kee cake were traded, with contracts for delivery in late May at 19.05 yuan, and another thousand pieces of Tai Yu cake were traded at 19 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Easing Trend Continues</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign exchange market, HSBC's opening rates showed British pound unchanged, US dollar up 0.0625 to 5.1875 yuan, Japanese yen up 0.025, Dutch guilder and French franc up 0.0125. There was no market for German marks. Exchange rates for Indian rupee, Hong Kong dollar and other currencies remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British pounds and US dollars was still gradually easing. Due to a speculator having bought 15,000 US dollars, the rate had hardened to 5.375 yuan, momentarily recovering to flat and becoming difficult to close out. Near noon, commercial banks selling US dollars, combined with rumours of Japanese cabinet reshuffle and negative news about German U-boats protecting US warships, causing speculators to cover their positions, and Hong Kong telegrams were also being sold, resulting in a renewed decline. In the afternoon, the China Bank also sold US dollars, making US dollars for next month's delivery at 5.4375 yuan difficult to close out. British gold reached 3 pence 3.125, as British banks showed a strong appetite for buying, and gold prices returned to the 6,400 yuan level. The US dollar alone softened slightly, closing at 5.40625 yuan, up 0.0625. British gold closed at 3 pence 3.125, up 0.03125. Trading volume was extremely active throughout the day.</p>
<p>HSBC's Opening Rates: British Pound Unchanged, US Dollar Up</p>
<p>According to morning news from abroad, British and American banks were closed for a holiday. The Indian silver market suddenly tightened sharply, with international exchange rates increasing by 0.03 yuan for US dollars against Shanghai, and 0.0625 yuan for British pounds against Shanghai, with other rates unchanged. The Central Bank's official rates remained unchanged. Bank selling prices opened higher in the domestic market, with spot British pounds at 3 pence 2.8125 and US dollars at 5.34375 yuan, before hardening slightly. Next month's US dollars reached 5.40625 yuan, and speculators bought this month's US dollars at 5.375, halting the decline and momentarily softening the rates. HSBC's opening rates showed British pound unchanged, US dollar up 0.0625. After the silver equalization tax remained at 24.5%, this month's US dollars at 5.375 yuan were also difficult to close out, and rates softened to 5.34375 yuan. HSBC and an American bank suddenly showed interest in selling, causing speculators to sell, and rumours of Hong Kong telegrams selling and other negative news began, causing market sentiment to harden. Speculators and Hong Kong telegrams aggressively sold June's US dollars at 5.375 and 5.40625 yuan, with the market closing at 5.375 yuan, allowing for close out, and the US dollar also hardened to 3 pence 2.96875.</p>
<p>Speculative Short Selling Becomes More Eager</p>
<p>As gold prices continued to decline in the afternoon, speculative short selling became even more eager, with aggressive selling of June's US dollars, pushing the rate up from 5.40625 yuan to 5.4375 yuan. Zhejiang Industrial Bank offered June's US dollars at a favorable rate of 5.4375 yuan, which was once close enough to close out at the offered price. British gold also hardened to 3 pence 3.125, which was also close enough to close out. Eventually, due to the excellent buying appetite of British banks, the rate softened again. At the 4:00 PM close, both spot and June-dated British gold remained at 3 pence 3.125, and the US dollar at 5.40625 yuan, up 0.03125 for British gold and 0.0625 for US dollars compared to last Saturday's close.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-Shanghai Exchange Rate Falls by Over One Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, December 12 (Monday): The foreign exchange market opened steady this morning, with no changes in British pound, US dollar, or Japanese yen rates.

<h3>Swap Rates Favor Sellers; Gold Market Fluctuates Unpredictably</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market turned from active trading and unofficial trading to unpredictable fluctuations. Various parties were particularly unsettled due to negative rumors. Tomorrow is the day to roll over from May to June contracts, and sellers need to pay a premium of 60 yuan, which favors buyers. Major players bought and sold frequently, causing market prices to change three times in a single day, initially falling, then rising, and then trending downwards again. Prices repeatedly broke the 6,400 yuan level. The market opened weak in the morning, and foreign exchange softened and leveled out as a Chinese merchant profited by covering a short position. Securities firms, banks, and gold firms all took the opportunity to sell, and the price rose from 6,430 yuan to 6,482 yuan. Near noon, rumors spread of American convoy ships being sunk by German U-boats and news of a Japanese cabinet reshuffle, and foreign exchange softened again. Banks, securities firms, and other parties sold again, and retail investors aggressively sold, causing the market to decline again. In the afternoon, US dollars for 5.4375 yuan were also available for close out, and bank firms also sold, causing the price to plummet to a low of 6,370 yuan. As foreign exchange ceased to soften, sellers covered their positions, and the price rebounded. The market closed at 6,414 yuan, up 73 yuan. After the close, the price rose again to 6,440 yuan. Total trading volume was 80,000 to 90,000 taels, and cash trading resumed. Tianyuan sold 300 taels, Xiangxingyong sold 150 taels, Yifeng, Yongfengyu, and Defu each sold 100 taels, and Chengda sold 60 taels, all bought by the gold firm Cheng Kee, with the price 230 yuan higher than the futures price. Chida sold 100 taels of Zhongxing and later bought back 50 taels of Shijie, also 230 yuan higher. Xiangxingyong sold 100 taels of Zhongxing, 230 yuan higher. No trades were heard of in the afternoon. The price was about 230 yuan higher, about 70 yuan more than last Saturday. Jewelry was down 10 yuan, priced at 685 yuan. The rollover date from May to June is the 14th of this month (Wednesday), which is earlier than usual at 8:00 AM and will formally go on the board at 8:15 AM. The sellers are said to be paying a premium to the buyers of around 50-60 yuan, and the June contract is expected to debut at 9:15 AM.</p>
<p>Unofficial Market Down Over 70 Yuan</p>
<p>Since this morning, with US dollars for 5.375 yuan available to close out, the market was weak and soft. At 9:15 AM, the opening price had already fallen to 6,440 yuan, a drop of 47 yuan. Cheng Kee and Decheng actively bought, pushing the price to 6,460 yuan. Renchengyong, Xinfengyong, and Defu sold, causing a sharp decline to 6,430 yuan. Yida and Tongkangyong actively bought, and Renchengyong, Xinyuan, Yifeng, and Heng Kee also bought, pushing the price back up to around 6,460 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, Heng Kee and retail investors bought, pushing the price up to 6,482 yuan. Near noon, negative rumors suddenly emerged, and Heng Kee and Yida started selling, and Defu and Cheng Kee also sold, causing floating long positions to liquidate, pushing the price down to 50 yuan and dropping to 6,430 yuan. The noon closing price was 6,440 yuan. Xinfengyong sold, and the price dropped to 6,428 yuan after the close. The market opened at 6,430 yuan at 2:00 PM, down 10 yuan. Yida, Chida, and Xinfengyong aggressively sold, and retail investors aggressively shorted, causing the price to gradually fall to within 6,400 yuan, dropping to 6,390 yuan, prompting gold firms and banks to set limit orders to buy, hovering around 6,400 yuan. As US dollars for 5.4375 yuan became available for close out, Decheng, Cheng Kee, Qingtaiyong, Tongkangyong, and Xinfengyong aggressively sold, causing the price to fall to a low of 6,370 yuan. As foreign exchange ceased to soften, Yida bought again, and Dafeng and Defu also bought, causing retail investors to cover their short positions, pushing the price up to 6,415 yuan. The market closed at 6,414 yuan at 4:00 PM, down 73 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing price. The closing price for May US dollars at 5.40625 yuan was 6,442 yuan. Liu pressed down 28 yuan. After the close, Defu, Dafeng, and Yida aggressively bought, pushing the price up to 6,440 yuan. Finally, there were sellers at 38 yuan, with a total difference of 73 yuan. The retail gold firms' branded gold was selling for 250 yuan higher than the futures price, and buying for 70-80 yuan lower than the selling price. Spot standard gold was still at the original price, with no market.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Down 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price for silver jewelry per tael at Da Tonghang and Xin Tonghang was initially set at 695 yuan, then reduced by 5 yuan at noon, and another 5 yuan at 3:00 PM, totaling 685 yuan, down 10 yuan. The buying price was 40 yuan lower than the exchange price.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Notes Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the active market price falling, while British and US gold pounds each rose by one yuan. British gold notes remained stable and flat. US dollar notes once retreated to 0.12 yuan, eventually closing at 18.20 yuan, down 0.24 yuan compared to last week. Hong Kong notes continued to soften, retreating to 0.46 and 0.48 yuan in the evening market. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes trended slightly higher, with the former rising to 2.08 yuan and the latter rising to 1.79 yuan.</p>
<h3>Economic Musings</h3>
<p>—Ma Liutang</p>
<p>Banking Weekly (Continued from 11th)</p>
<p>Because China's first exchange, the Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange, was established, Xu Yongzuo was responsible for planning and compiling the exchange's accounting affairs. In 1921, Xu Cangshui succeeded him as editor-in-chief. After Cangshui's death, Dai Lulu, the editor of the Beijing Banking Monthly, took over. Li Quanzhi followed Dai, marking the general outline of these personnel changes.</p>
<p>Since the Banking Weekly was published weekly, it included weekly sections on commercial conditions, finance, essays, communications, surveys, and statistics, pioneering a model for the compilation of economic magazines. With this model, economic publications were no longer without a guide, and one after another, they followed suit. The widespread attention to the Gerner Report by the Chinese banking community was largely due to the Banking Weekly's translation efforts; otherwise, Gerner's name could not have become so well-known in the Chinese business community!</p>
<p>Because the Shanghai banking community had the Banking Weekly, the Beijing banking community also launched the Banking Monthly. When the Banking Monthly was first published, the Shanghai Banking Weekly even sent people to help; each issue only published communication reports received by the Bank of China from its branches. Later, when Dai Lulu joined, essays and other writings also began to appear.</p>
<p>Following the Beijing Banking Monthly was the Banking Magazine, published by the Hankou Banking Association and managed by Li Guphan. Initially, Pan Shihao was invited to edit, but due to Shihao's illness, his brother Pan Gengsheng founded the publication. Later, Zhou Chengang continued to edit it.</p>
<p>To this day, the only publication still being published is the Banking Weekly, which was the first to be launched.</p>
<p>In 1916 and 1917, although people knew to value economic writing, those who could write were as rare as phoenix feathers. Since the Banking Weekly appeared, people gradually became familiar with economic writing through exposure. Those who are now known as economic scholars and experts were largely obscure at the time, and most were probably still studying, not as arrogant and conceited as they are today. But this shows progress, and progress is a welcome phenomenon. As the saying goes, "The younger generation is to be feared; how do we know that those who come later will not surpass us?" This also embodies the meaning of "Heaven moves strongly; the superior man strengthens himself without ceasing."</p>
<p>The recognition of statistics in the world was previously limited to customs publications, but Huang Renzhi was the first to utilize and classify customs publications into books. Yang Duanlu and Hou Houpei's compilations came much later. Of course, later compilations surpassed the former, but at the time of Huang Renzhi's compilation, the era was different, and this insight was indeed beyond reproach. Compiling statistics from customs publications, using existing materials, and being organized by foreigners was not difficult. But for the statistics to be created by the Chinese themselves, we must consider the Shanghai Survey Office for Commodity Prices, established in 1919, as the pioneer, which is the predecessor of today's National Tariff Commission. It was then that various statistics compiled by the Chinese themselves began to circulate, gaining a place in the world's statistics. The Banking Weekly also followed suit, compiling monthly economic statistics, printed as a booklet, and sent with the newspaper, which conveniently compiled daily market prices. Of course, the content focused primarily on finance.</p>
<p>The Qian industry, which has always held the reins of Shanghai's financial world, was not willing to fall behind. Finally, Qin Runqing initiated the launch of the Qian Industry Monthly in February 1921, with Tu Guangfu as the editor. Tu resigned in the autumn of 1927, and a committee was established, with Hu Shuren, Wang Chusheng, Wang Weiqiao, and Wei Youfei serving as editors one after another. The publication was suspended in December 1937 due to the incident, having published seventeen volumes. (End)</p>
<h3>Securities: Multiple Parties Powerfully Boost Domestic Bonds</h3>
<p>In the unofficial public bond market, the situation yesterday was initially weak but later strengthened, as previous days had been soft, the major players put in their last efforts to pull it upwards in the afternoon. Sinfu took the lead, and Tongkang followed, which prompted some short covering, but the gains were clearly forced. Although the market closed at high prices, there was no one willing to accept the selling offer 0.1-0.2 yuan higher. This situation is perhaps a technique for the major players to find a way to exit their positions. It can be seen that Class A bonds were only in better shape by 0.2 yuan, while Class C bonds were in better shape by as much as 0.6 yuan, an abnormal situation. Let's see how the trends are today. Yesterday morning, Yitai and Hongda bought in slightly, while Tongkang, Lianhe, and Jiaoyu sold. At noon, there were more declines than gains. In the afternoon, Sinfu raised prices to buy, causing Tongkang to cover its position, and Shengda also followed suit by covering short positions, prompting Hongda to increase its bets. Jiufu also absorbed some, but Yitai was already reselling, Lianhe continued to sell, and Lemao, Yichang, and Runli aggressively sold. Although market prices rose by 0.2 to 0.6 yuan, there were only sell offers after the close, with no buyers. On the surface, it recovered by 0.2 to 0.6 yuan, but the total trading volume was approximately 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 200 shares of New New Company were traded, priced at 21 yuan each.</p>
<p>The public stock exchange opened steady, but the trend softened as the Shanghai market reported easing conditions. With the exception of rubber stocks, trading in other stocks was still active. Prices improved slightly near the close, but were only slightly higher than the lowest price.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower: Yarn Sales Decline, Sudden Price Drop</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had stabilized slightly over the weekend, is now declining again, and the price drop is particularly severe. This is due to the continued easing of foreign exchange rates and the fall in margin calls, which has led to a loss of confidence. Actual sales are increasingly sluggish. However, the Guangdong merchants still have some scattered demand for 10-count coarse yarn, so some large bullish players are holding firm. As a result, the market situation saw a brief period of hesitation. However, recently, due to the weakness of Japanese yarn and the lack of trading in mixed-brand yarn, and the unfavorable environment, the bearish side has tended to sell off. As soon as the price drop started, sellers rushed in. In short, there are many people currently bearish, and without the development of wholesale trading, there is no hope for a turnaround in the market. 20-count Shuangma yarn was priced at a high of 1,470 yuan and a low of 1,433 yuan. The afternoon market was extremely chaotic, initially trading at 1,429 yuan, but due to the sharp fall in yarn prices on the exchange, people were panicked, and it plummeted to 1,407 yuan. However, those making a profit rushed to cover their positions, and it rebounded to 1,429 yuan at the close.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, and because there were many bullish players, they continued to push prices up. However, the gold merchants had already started selling, and the opening price was 1,455 yuan. Then, due to the strong bullish activity and steady margin calls, it rose to 1,469 to 1,470 yuan. However, spot sales were only for coarse yarn, and 20-count yarn was normal, but people were holding on firmly, fluctuating around 656 yuan for a long time. Unexpectedly, as it approached 11:45, the market suddenly weakened due to the fall in gold prices and the easing of exchange rates. The selling pressure surged, and the market gradually declined, closing at 1,433 yuan. A check of the trading volume for half a day showed 10,320 bales traded. The amount bought by each merchant is as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 520 bales</p>
<p>Colleagues: 9,800 bales</p>
<p>Total: 10,320 bales</p>
<p>The current cotton situation is desolate. This is because yarn prices have fallen sharply, and both Chinese and foreign factories have little interest in purchasing raw materials. Therefore, the cotton market has also been drawn into the vortex.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Prices Fall Sharply, Market Declines Straight Down</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The price drop in the JST crystal cloth market is large. This is because people are shaken, and floating long positions are being sold off, settling accounts, but there are few buyers. Therefore, cloth prices have plummeted. As a result, white fine cloth fell by 1 to 1.5 yuan per piece, coarse cloth twill fell by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan per piece, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by about 1 yuan. The market is very chaotic, and transactions are scarce. Transactions in this street amounted to over 100 pieces of various goods. Customer merchants slowly purchased only over 100 pieces of Jardine Matheson 9-pound coarse cloth and local factory twill colored cloth from Guangdong and Hong Kong. Over 2,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth were purchased for Singapore, Siam, and other places.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, sluggish actual sales, and great uncertainty, all cloths have fallen sharply across the board. In the spot market, the lowest price for white Longtou fine cloth in the afternoon was 46.3 yuan. Midway, short sellers covered their positions, rebounding to 48.2 yuan, but the market atmosphere was still weak, falling to 47.6 yuan at the close. The price of colored cloth "Four Gentlemen" serge was particularly chaotic. It opened at 1.512 yuan in the morning, gradually falling to 1.475 yuan. In the afternoon, the market opened and plummeted to 1.4 yuan, closing at 1.4425 yuan.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics Rise Steadily, Le Road Recedes Step by Step</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the selling price of woolen fabrics remained firm and high. Except for Palaisse, which was cheaper, all others were rising. Because overseas orders require advance payment of deposit and prior purchase of foreign exchange, ordering has completely stopped. As for previous orders, shipping is difficult, and it is difficult to predict whether they can arrive. Local factory goods are short and expensive due to the lack of raw materials, output is small, and prices have risen. Also, due to the surplus of legal tender in Shanghai, hoarding by both insiders and outsiders has not weakened, so confidence is further strengthened. However, looking at the sales side, (1) due to traffic obstructions, internal merchants have stopped purchasing, and it is difficult to obtain transportation permits in the occupied areas, so they cannot be sold smoothly. (2) Because the price of all goods is rising endlessly and the cost of living is increasing daily, actual sales of woolen fabrics have also weakened accordingly.</p>
<h3>Coal: Underground Trading of Coal Balls Eliminated</h3>
<p>Retail Price at Shops: 16 Yuan per Load</p>
<p>The coal ball market, due to rumors of positive factors at the end of last month, general hoarders raised the underground price to 330 yuan. Subsequently, because the factory limited the time for clearing out, the spot price of 296 yuan was supplied as much as possible, so old orders could not be hoarded for long, and the underground market collapsed spontaneously, returning to normal. The retail price at shops is generally 16 yuan per load (there are exceptions for small factory goods, which are charged 5 yuan more per load). However, there are still expectations of rising prices in the future, and indefinite warehouse receipts are being raised by 15 yuan, according to market reports.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Spot Sugar Continues to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to trend downward, but futures rebounded. The association quoted 24 coarse whites, with spot prices at external warehouses at 114.7 to 114.8 yuan, 70 cents lower for small quantities. The 20th day delivery order opened at 115.4 to 115.2 to 115.1 yuan, 80 cents lower for small quantities. The end of the month delivery order was 117.8 to 117.9 to 117.6 to 117.4 to 117.6 to 117.3 yuan, an increase of 30 cents. Taikoo granulated white B mark was 116 yuan at the main warehouse and 115.5 yuan at the west warehouse, 1 yuan lower for small quantities. DY mark was 104 yuan at the east warehouse, 2 yuan lower for small quantities. HX was only 20 cents lower at 103 yuan at the east warehouse.</p>
<h3>Rubber (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>It wasn't until 1823 that the use of rubber was first expanded. Because there was a major chemical industrialist named Macintosh in Glasgow, England, he found the solvent for rubber - using Benzine - which could melt the rubber, spread it between two layers of thin cloth, and create "raincoats". He built a large factory in Manchester, engaged in manufacturing, and since then raincoats have become popular everywhere under his name. Later, in 1829, there were Guibal and Rattier, - French people? - The first to use the elasticity of rubber to create "garters" and "suspenders", that is, they cut the rubber ball in half from the middle, and then wrapped each half into a long strip in a spiral shape, and then divided it into strands, interwoven in the middle of cotton thread to succeed. These products were also popular all over the world, and still are now.</p>
<p>However, what limited the long-term development of rubber was a major shortcoming of its own. When the weather was too hot, reaching thirty or forty degrees, it would become viscous, and then collapse, and the elasticity and impermeability would be completely erased. But when the climate is too cold, it becomes hard and brittle, and easily broken. This shortcoming was also made up for in 1839 by an American industrialist named Goodyer. Goodyer was born in New Haven, and first made agricultural tools, but later his family fell into decline, so he turned his attention to the rubber industry. He wanted to improve the solid nature of rubber, so he mixed various substances into it to engage in experimentation. One day, he accidentally mixed sulfur and rubber, and used high heat to melt and burn it. Unexpectedly, the rubber that was produced was firm, strong, and not easy to melt. High heat and extreme cold did not want to shake it at all. The rubber business has progressed rapidly since then. In 1851, a Frenchman named Myrey tripled the amount of sulfur mixed with rubber. The result was that the finished product - hard rubber - was compact, bright, and easy to polish, just like real ebony. So wooden cores, buttons, bowls, dishes... decorations, daily necessities, and a large batch of so-called "Bakelite" things came out. Who knows how far rubber will develop in the future?</p>
<p>The quality of rubber is extremely inconsistent. Initially, Castilloa rubber from Central America was considered the best. Now, due to the indigenous people's harvesting, it is almost extinct. Since the mid-19th century, the Para city south of the mouth of the Amazon River in Brazil has exported the most, and the quality is also the best, which is what people call "Para rubber". The so-called Catilloa rubber tree is distributed in the mountains from Mexico to Peru. Initially, the Indians took rubber by felling rubber trees and dividing them into sections, which was "draining the pond to catch all the fish." There were also spiral or large V-shaped cuts made in the tree trunk. These actions were so barbaric that the rubber tree often died due to excessive "plant blood" flowing out. The natives used utensils to receive the white sap, mixed it with a kind of clay to make pear-shaped spheres, dipped it in the sap, took it out, and dried it in the sun or smoked it dry. There was a very thin layer of rubber on the mud ball. After dipping it again and drying it, when the rubber skin was thick enough, they smashed the mud core and took it out, and the so-called "elastic pear-shaped utensil" was successful.</p>
<p>Brazilian Para rubber comes from a rubber tree called Hovea. This tree is divided into two types, one black and one white, distributed on both sides of the Amazon River and its tributaries, in the famous Selvas forest where human traces have not yet fully reached. Rubber tappers, called Seringueros in Portuguese, are roughly concentrated in the city of Manaus - that prosperous city of Manaus perched at the confluence of the Amazon River and the Negro River. When there were many rubber trees in the past, everywhere you looked, these Seringueros, both men and women, set off for their destinations at dawn every day, carrying baskets and hampers, with knives, axes and basins. After arriving, they searched for rubber trees separately - which can also be called plant cows - and used knives and axes to cut cracks in the tree trunk. Below, they used sticky mud to stick the basins, or simply placed them on the ground. Afterwards, the sap trickled down from the cracks. The sap usually stopped flowing from three to eleven hours. So the Indians collected the sap from all places and started the smoking work. Before this work, it was necessary to first build a small adobe kiln, covered with a metal chimney, and burn freshly split palm branches and leaves inside, so that the smoke would be thicker. After the fire was lit, a wooden spatula was used, dipped in sap, and stretched into the chimney to smoke. So they smoked and dipped, and dipped and smoked, the rubber accumulated layer by layer, forming a spherical shape, some of which could weigh up to fifty kilograms. This is the so-called Para City with the purest and best quality rubber, which is transferred to various European countries.</p>
<p>The situation is a little different now. The rubber trees nearby have been felled by the natives again and again, and they are becoming rarer and rarer. They have to drive a small boat up the Amazon River and its tributaries to find new fields, and the season is also limited. It is roughly from July to October. When they go, they are at least in groups of two, choosing a landing point and a small adobe kiln for smoking rubber, and then laboriously searching for rubber trees everywhere, because now this rubber is always very sparse. Although there must be many "plant cows" growing in the "virgin forest" far from the river, there are swarms of poisonous snakes and wild beasts everywhere, and it is really a bit risky to go in, and the journey is long and the expenses are also high.</p>

<h3>Preventing Hoarding and Distributing Equally: Hong Kong Rice Will Limit Purchase Quantity, Each Person Must Not Exceed One Month's Needs, Rice Shops Will Prioritize Fixed Rice, Rice Transport Rubber Wheel Handcart Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of Lap Kee &amp; Co., yesterday he told reporters that the first batch of 5,000 tons of Hong Kong rice, a total of four ships, in addition to the Tai Koo Company's Hanyang Wheel and Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng Wheel that arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the day before yesterday), the Tai Koo Company's Taiyuan Wheel and Jiangsu Wheel arrived yesterday. In addition, there is also the Yuesheng Wheel, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai before Saturday. It is heard that the government will issue a statement in one or two days, announcing the sales method, in addition to the price and quality have been stipulated, each stone of 80 kilograms, that is, 160 market pounds, sold for 110 yuan, and strictly prohibit price increases and adulteration. According to reliable sources from Lap Kee &amp; Co., it will be stipulated that the amount of rice purchased by each customer must not exceed the amount needed for more than one month. As for how much rice should be needed in one month, it will be determined by the distributors. It is heard that this regulation is entirely to prevent hoarding, because the rice for the next month will be supplied by another batch of Hong Kong rice, so there is no need to store more.</p>
<p>Four More Ships Transport Rice to Shanghai</p>
<p>It was also learned that this week, a large amount of rice will arrive in Shanghai. It is heard that one lot is Saigon rice ordered by the French Municipal Council, totaling 10,000 tons, part of which will be carried to Shanghai by the French ships Gouvenneut Gen. A. Varenne and Albert Sarraut. In addition to the following two ships, there are also two freighters from the Java Company, which can transport a large amount of rice to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. Therefore, it is expected that in the future, when the supply exceeds demand, the price of rice will continue to fall sharply.</p>
<p>Most of the Arrived Hong Kong Rice is Sold Retail</p>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," after the first batch of 5,600 tons of rice purchased by the Shanghai Municipal Council from Hong Kong arrived in port, the price of rice fell by another five yuan from 125 yuan this morning (the 12th). Responsible persons stated that 600 tons of the first batch of Hong Kong rice will be handed over to wholesale rice merchants, and most of the remaining 5,000 tons will be distributed to retail rice shops today or tomorrow (the 13th) and sold at a maximum price of 110 yuan. Rice speculators predicted that rain would delay the arrival of Hong Kong rice in Shanghai, so they slightly pulled back the price of rice on Saturday and Sunday last week. This morning, they still tried to raise the price of rice, but they had exhausted their skills, and the price of rice finally fell by five yuan.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice Will Arrive Within the Week</p>
<p>It is heard that another batch of Hong Kong rice is expected to arrive in Shanghai within the week, and thereafter, about 25,000 tons of Hong Kong rice will be shipped every month. At the same time, the French authorities are now waiting for the first batch of 8,000 tons of Saigon rice purchased from Vietnam to arrive, with a maximum selling price of 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Order Quantity Exceeds Arrived Amount</p>
<p>The Hong Kong rice that has arrived this time is small-grain rice, which is no different from the Rangoon 40-grain small-grain rice sold on the market. The rumor that rice speculators spread a few days ago that this small-grain rice contains a lot of broken rice will naturally be refuted without attack. The various grain shops and rice shops that went to Cheung Mao &amp; Co. to pay for the goods were endless all day long. However, the Hong Kong rice that has arrived this time is only over 50,000 bags, and the rice pre-ordered by the various grain shops and rice shops is several times more than this number. Therefore, the rice that arrives first this time can only be distributed to the various grain shops and rice shops in advance for a certain number of bags to maintain the continued arrival of rice, and then supplement the pre-ordered number. Currently, Lap Kee &amp; Co. has started to handle the distribution procedures. According to an employee of the company, the distribution procedures can be completed yesterday, and after being submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council for review and approval, distribution and sales can begin.</p>
<p>Rice Speculators Panicked, Market Price Continued to Plunge</p>
<p>In recent days, the buying and selling situation in the rice market has been improving day by day. Statistics show that since a week ago, the average price of rice in various stalls has fallen by about 30 yuan. General rice speculators holding goods are quite panicked and are all lowering prices to sell off large amounts of hoarded goods. After the rice market opened yesterday morning, due to the arrival of the first batch of cheap foreign rice, rice hoarders scrambled to sell off hoarded goods, resulting in the supply of spot goods in the market exceeding demand, and people unanimously looking down. Rice shops no longer intend to absorb spot goods in the market, waiting for the price of rice to continue to fall. At that time, the market situation was quite depressed. As a result, the price of rice in each stall fell by 4-5 yuan per stone compared to the previous market. Today, the highest price for foreign rice is 128 yuan, and the highest price for domestic rice is 137 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Transport Carters Went on Strike Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>In this city, there are as many as one thousand and several hundred carters who specialize in transporting rice for rice shops using tractor rubber wheel handcarts. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, due to the constant rice-grabbing incidents and the soaring price of rice, each rice shop gradually switched to using trucks for transportation in order to reduce the number of robbery incidents and unnecessary losses, and gradually switched to using trucks entirely. Although the carters repeatedly requested to maintain the status quo in order to maintain their livelihoods, there has been no effect for several months. Recently, due to the soaring prices of goods, the carters actively requested relief, but the Rice Shop Association did not respond, resulting in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Threatened by Livelihood: Although the carters, hungry and cold, have requested a deadline for a reply and petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council, they have been unable to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, starting at 8:00 a.m. yesterday, all of them went on strike (all vehicles were not pulled out), and all 1,000-odd workers gathered in front of foreign warehouses such as the Shuntai Warehouse, where rice was stored, on the one hand, dispatching a delegation of 200-odd people to petition the northern office of the Rice Shop Association at Maoye Lane, Shanhai Pass Road. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, considering that the number of striking workers was large, was deeply concerned that other excessive actions would occur. Therefore, a large number of detectives were specially dispatched to maintain order at the places where the workers gathered. The Rice Shop Association's office sent Secretary Wang Yuting to invite the workers' representatives Zheng Xueyuan and Liu Shouming to talk, urging the workers to wait quietly for the authorities to mediate, so as to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest.</p>
<p>Authorities Consult: The Public Concession Shanghai Municipal Council considered the matter serious and related to the entire people's food problem. Therefore, in addition to dispatching detectives to protect, it also dispatched political department detectives such as Li Bijun to conduct investigations into the truth of the dispute separately. On the one hand, it also invited Fu Qian'geng, chairman of the Rice Shop Association, to the political department for consultation, and scheduled to convene representatives from both sides today and tomorrow to conduct mediation in order to resolve the labor unrest as soon as possible. The Rice Shop Association also invited the former workers' general representatives Zhang Maocai, Li Guozhu, Liu Yufu and three others to the association at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to talk, so as to negotiate from within.</p>
<p>Petition Today: As for the truck workers who are currently responsible for transporting rice, it is heard that after the truck workers' strike, someone had sent someone to contact the carters' representatives, and they were also willing to sympathize with and assist the striking workers. Because the number of people was large, they were afraid that excessive actions would occur. Therefore, they organized a disciplinary team. The striking workers also scheduled to petition the Shanghai Municipal Council today.</p>
<h3>New Putang's Annual Donation: Separate Printing of List of Donors</h3>
<p>Not Within the Scope of This Fundraising</p>
<p>The Xin Pu Yutang was founded single-handedly by Mr. Lu Bohong. For 30 years, he devoted his life to it. Over the years, he personally donated and raised funds from all walks of life, amounting to a huge sum. Since Mr. Lu passed away, his son has inherited his legacy, working together with the Catholic Needle Society to maintain it. Currently, the hall provides care for 1,000 elderly, young, disabled, poor, and sick men and women, and the monthly expenditure requires 16,000 yuan. There has never been a fixed amount of funds. This time, a temporary fundraising was initiated by this newspaper, appealing to all walks of life, and repeatedly received donations of cash, goods, and other items. Yesterday, the hall published a thank-you advertisement in the newspaper. However, the annual donations solicited by the hall at the end of the lunar year over the years, as a rule, the hall compiles and prints a list of donors, which is sent to the donors, and is not included in the number of thank-you advertisements published in the newspaper yesterday. It is heard that the list of annual donors is currently being compiled and printed.</p>

In addition to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang, dozens of ministers and officials from various departments and committees also sent them. In addition, dozens of wreaths and elegiac couplets were sent by Zhengyan Daily, Sino-American Daily, and various circles.</p>
<p>Dreary Wind and Rain, Grieving Family</p>
<p>Mrs. Jin, Qiu Peizhen, suffered this tragic change with a body weakened by many illnesses. Standing next to the spiritual platform, she thanked the guests, looked at the portrait, and almost burst into tears. The children Jiewu, Jieming, and Jieyun, although young, seemed to know that they were now fatherless children, and all had worried expressions on their faces. Moreover, the wind and rain added to the sorrow.</p>
<h3>Plague Raging in Hong Kong and Macau</h3>
<p>According to passengers from Hong Kong who arrived in Shanghai yesterday, since the discovery of the plague in Hong Kong, it has become increasingly rampant today. The total number of people suffering from the disease has reached 674, of which more than half have died due to inadequate treatment, totaling more than 410. The Hong Kong health authorities are now starting to seal off the epidemic area and carry out all disinfection work. On the one hand, they are also forcing vaccinations. In Macau, the plague has been extremely rampant in the past month, and more than 100 people have died. The Macau authorities are now at a loss, and the general residents are extremely panicked.</p>
<h3>Photograph of the Memorial Hall for Jin Huating</h3>

<h3>Stabilization Fund Stabilizes the Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Committee Members Chen Guangfu and Four Others Ensure Long-Term Stability of Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Following the establishment of Sino-British and Sino-American monetary agreements, loans, and the maintenance of currency credibility and foreign exchange stability in China, a Stabilization Fund Committee was established to be specifically responsible for the application of the fund.

<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation</h3>
<p>Postal and Telecommunications Interrupted, Passengers Detour; Postal and Telecommunications in Eastern Zhejiang Inland are Normal</p>
<p>The state of transportation and postal telecommunications between Shanghai and Ningbo has not yet returned to normal. According to a source from Datong News Agency, since Ningbo's fall, transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo has only been maintained by Japanese military transport ships traveling directly from Zhenhai Port. Other foreign merchant ships have not yet resumed sailing. In addition, the so-called route from Qingpu to Yuyao Songpu is actually only the Zhangjiajun to Yuyao Anjiao line using sailboats, which has resumed operation. Travel agencies claiming to take passengers via Qingpu actually still send passengers to Zhangjiajun to cross Hangzhou Bay to Andong. Therefore, the only route currently open between Shanghai and Ningbo is this one. Furthermore, regarding telegrams, because the Ningbo Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications had already dismantled and loaded its equipment and retreated to Lishui, resumption is not easy. The same is true for Zhenhai, Fenghua, Cixi, Yuyao, and other places. The Ningbo Post Office has resumed operations, but the official Shanghai-Ningbo postal route is still suspended. In the past half month, there have been no mailbags exchanged. However, the post office still accepts light mail for temporary storage, pending resumption of traffic before sending. Money orders have also been completely suspended. However, telegraphic transfers to Lishui, Yuqian, Jinhua, Fangyan, Lanxi, and other places are still possible.</p>

The management issued dismissal notices, and the workers began a strike on the 19th, with the situation becoming very serious. After vigorous mediation by the industry, both sides began negotiations. It is now known that the labor dispute was completely resolved the afternoon before yesterday. Drivers will receive a uniform increase of 30 yuan per month, and laborers will receive 25 yuan. The labor side is satisfied, and the entire workforce has resumed work this morning.</p>
<p>Color Printing Demands</p>
<p>Over a thousand workers in the local color printing industry, feeling that current prices are high and meager wages are insufficient to cover expenses, began a strike on the 10th of this month. At that time, besides verbally requesting the management to improve their treatment, no specific conditions were put forward. It is now known that the labor side formally submitted documents to the management the day before yesterday, requesting a 200% increase in monthly salary and 5 dou of rice subsidy. The management is currently considering the matter, and representatives from both sides are expected to begin negotiations today to seek an appropriate solution.</p>

<p>Huge Value of Copper Ingots and Daily Necessities Confiscated; Crew Members Detained</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, it is reported from reliable sources that customs anti-smuggling officers received a report last week and searched tricycles, seizing contraband worth a huge sum of one million yuan, which was confiscated. The tricycles searched included:</p>

<p>Search Circumstances</p>
<p>Knowing that the Suzhou, which arrived that day and was about to dock at the Bund in the French Concession, was carrying copper and tin ingots worth over 500,000 yuan, a large number of personnel were dispatched to board and search the Suzhou upon its arrival. After fifteen hours, copper and tin ingots were found in the coal bunker. It is reported that the owner of the smuggled goods has escaped, but several crew members have been detained, suspected of knowing that there were smuggled goods on board. On Friday, customs officers searched the Shandong again and also found smuggled copper and tin ingots, which were transported to the customs office on Saturday morning and confiscated.</p>

<h3>Final Arguments in the Fang Dan Case Yesterday; Heated Debate Between the Two Sides; Plaintiff's Lawyer Cites Land Regulations; Randall's Proclamation Cannot Be Used as a Basis</h3>
<p>The case of four Chinese landowners suing the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) for collecting land taxes on Fang Dan land was heard in the Consular Court yesterday afternoon at 2:30 p.m. in the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting room. The attendees were Judge George (British Consul-General), Lockehead (U.S. Consul-General), Horiuchi (Japanese Consul-General), Defendant's lawyer Bohlen, and Plaintiffs' lawyers Liu Shifang and Wang Jian. British Consul-General George served as the Chief Justice. The debate lasted for two hours, with heated arguments over the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang and the Tanggu Report concerning Fang Dan land donations. However, the date of the judgment was not announced yesterday. It is expected to be given no later than one week from now.</p>
<p>Key Points Stated by the Plaintiff's Lawyer</p>
<p>After the court opened, the plaintiff's lawyer Liu Shifang stood up and said that the facts of the case were simple. The four plaintiffs were all descendants of the owners of Fang Dan land, and they had neither sold nor leased the land to others. Both parties had no dispute over these facts. Therefore, the focus of the case was purely a legal question, namely, whether the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) had the right to collect donations and taxes on Fang Dan land. According to the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang and the speech of Mr. Mettheusdett, chairman of the Taxpaying Westerners' Association in 1870, the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) had no right to collect donations. Furthermore, Randall's proclamation of 1855 could not be used as a basis for collecting donations because before issuing the proclamation, Randall had exchanged documents with the British, American, and French consuls, stating that old Chinese residents had the right to continue residing in the concession, and that these people were different from those who entered the concession for refuge.</p>
<p>No Right to Collect Fang Dan Land Tax</p>
<p>Liu continued, stating that the Shanghai International Settlement was Chinese land, and that the Chinese government had leased an area to foreigners for residence. This was called a "servitude" in international law. The Chinese government granted the right to collect donations, so this power must necessarily be interpreted in favor of the grantor. If the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) claimed to have the right to collect taxes, then it must have clear proof and concrete reasons, and could not rely solely on analogy. Moreover, the Chinese government has always retained sovereignty and has never agreed to the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局)'s collection of Fang Dan land taxes, and has often obstructed the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局)'s collection. As to whether the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) has the right to cut off electricity and water supplies due to refusal to pay donations, this must be based on a court judgment. The Tanggu Report pointed out that violence should not be used to cut off electricity and water supplies before a court judgment. If the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局), as an administrative organ, also becomes a legislative organ, then what is it that it cannot do?</p>
<p>How Can the Defendant Abuse Power?</p>
<p>Liu continued, stating that the Consular Court was different from ordinary courts, and did not apply the laws of any particular country. Therefore, its rulings must be based on legal principles and fairness. The plaintiffs had lived here for generations, and no one could force them to sell their land. Therefore, Randall's proclamation could not be applied to them. Although the defendant claimed that the organization of the Shanghai International Settlement was a consensual group, the plaintiffs were not a part of it. Therefore, it was unfounded to apply the theory of a consensual group to the plaintiffs. If it was necessary to have the plaintiffs pay donations, then the Land Regulations would have to be amended, which would require the consent of the Chinese government. By extension, even if the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) had the right to collect this land donation, it should file a lawsuit with the court under its jurisdiction. There was no reason for the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) to abuse its power.</p>
<p>Defendant's Lawyer Presents Rebuttal</p>
<p>Bohlen then stood up and said that the ownership of the plaintiffs' land dated back to 1855, which, although before the third expansion of the concession area, was still after the establishment of the original British Concession. Therefore, the Land Regulations of 1854 and Randall's proclamation also applied to them. When the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Special District Court, the agreement signed stated that the Land Regulations were recognized by the Chinese government. Therefore, the Land Regulations were naturally valid. Since the Land Regulations stated that the Taxpaying Westerners' Association had the right to collect other donations and taxes, then according to this provision, the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) naturally had the right to collect Fang Dan land taxes from the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Pretending to Overthrow the Tanggu Report</p>
<p>According to the former American Concession Regulations, Chinese landowners did not have to pay land donations, but the original landowners did not include their heirs. The plaintiffs' claim of international servitude was based on a dissertation by a Dr. Diao and could not be compared with authoritative works on international law. According to the opinion of international law scholar Martens, all treaties concluded under political coercion were invalid. Therefore, international public law should be the basis. The Tanggu Report, which stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) could not collect taxes from Fang Dan land, was naturally not entirely correct. As for the plaintiffs' claim that all those who did not pay donations must be judged by a court before their electricity and water supplies could be cut off, this court had already ruled in a similar case that electricity and water supplies could be cut off. Since the facts of this case were the same as the previous case, this court should rule according to precedent.</p>
<p>Cannot Have Retroactive Effect</p>
<p>At this time, Lawyer Liu stood up and said that the so-called acquisition of ownership by the plaintiff in 1855 was inconsistent with the facts. According to this time being the fifth year of Xianfeng, it was the time of issuing the Fang Dan, which was also a substitute for the Fang Dan issued in 1780. Therefore, it was sufficient to prove that the plaintiffs' ancestors had lived here before 1780. The defendant also claimed that according to the recently amended Land Regulations, the defendant had the right to collect land donations, but whether this action was valid was debatable. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) could not amend it and have the right to have legal retroactive effect.</p>
<p>Randall's Proclamation Should Be Based on the Chinese Text</p>
<p>Also, the defendant's claim that Randall's proclamation should be based on the English text was unreasonable because Randall's proclamation was issued for the Chinese to read, so how could it be based on the English text? Now Ru Bao Yi recognizes that the Chinese and English texts are consistent, which is equivalent to recognizing the validity of treaties concluded under political coercion. How contradictory is this? Judge Tanggu was hired by the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) at a high price and took a year to produce the report. Now the defendant believes that the various points based on the report by the plaintiff have no value. This is something that I cannot help but regret.</p>
<p>Requesting a Fair Judgment</p>
<p>Previously, this court had a judgment to cut off electricity and water in similar cases. I have already stated that the theory based on the consensual group cannot be applied, so that case cannot be used as a precedent in this case. Since the circumstances of each case are different, each case should be discussed on a case-by-case basis in order to obtain a fair judgment. What I am now requesting from your court is that the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) has no right to collect this land tax, and whether that micro-collection right exists still has great doubts. Your court should order the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) to seek a diplomatic solution, etc. At this point in the interrogation, it was already 4:15. The judges briefly consulted and then announced the adjournment at 4:25.</p>
<h3>Fell into the River and Died</h3>
<p>Lin Weigen, a 54-year-old man from Suzhou, was crossing the Huangpu River from Pudong to Shanghai at 8:00 p.m. on the 5th. When disembarking at the Huangyuchuan Wharf outside Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, he accidentally fell into the river. He was rescued and sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but died at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. The body was sent to the coroner's office by the police car, pending examination, investigation, and notification of family members to claim the body.</p>
<h3>Passenger Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinmu, a 31-year-old man from Beiping, booked room 203 at the Guotai Hotel at 28 Balichiao Street the day before yesterday. That night, he committed suicide by taking poison. The waiter discovered him and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died. The police sent the body to the coroner's office by car. Since there were no family members, the body was photographed and buried by the charity organization. The belongings are stored pending claim by family members.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Sinks Boats in Suzhou Creek; Western Newspaper Investigates in Detail; 250 Boats Destroyed in Three Days; 1,500 People Displaced</h3>
<p>Since the local newspapers disclosed on the 11th that the English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that more than a hundred sampans were sunk or confiscated by the Japanese army along the section of Suzhou Creek from Macgen Road to Changping Road on the morning of the 10th in a bleak wind and bitter rain, causing hundreds of families to be displaced, all Chinese and foreigners expressed deep sympathy for the plight of these people. Unexpectedly, the spokesman of the Japanese Navy and the Allied News Agency decided that Japan would solemnly deny the matter. However, the English-language Da Mei Evening News, published yesterday, not only published eight photos taken during the on-site investigation on the morning of the 10th but also revealed that similar incidents had occurred on the 9th and 11th, with about 250 sampans sunk and about 1,500 people displaced.</p>
<p>Boat Sinking Incident Occurs Again</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News stated that forty-eight hours after the spokesman of the Japanese Navy denied that the Japanese army had sunk sampans, it was heard that eighty small sampans had been sunk again yesterday. According to eyewitnesses, soldiers of the Japanese Naval Special Landing Forces, carrying axes and sledgehammers, went to the previous shipwreck site yesterday and forced the boatmen to sink the sampans. If the boatmen were unwilling, the Japanese army planned to tow the sampans to other places. This morning, an old woman, over sixty years old, told reporters with tears in her eyes that she relied entirely on her sixteen-year-old son's peddling for a living, so she could not afford to rent a house. Now the only place where they could live has been destroyed, and their future life is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Investigation Results Completely Confirmed</p>
<p>According to the results of the continued investigation this morning (the 12th), it has been completely confirmed that the boat sinking action that occurred last Saturday (the 10th) did indeed take place. The Zi Lin Western News and the Thames News reported that the Japanese army denied the matter and claimed that this newspaper's disclosure of the news was "reversing right and wrong," which proves that the above two newspapers did not send reporters to the site for an on-site investigation after the incident occurred. According to eyewitnesses, in addition to the more than one hundred sampans sunk last Saturday (the 10th), sampans were also sunk last Friday (the 9th). A total of about 250 sampans were destroyed before and after. It was also heard that some sampans had been towed away by the Japanese side, while others were dismantled by the owners and sold as timber.</p>
<p>Some Boat Households Still Remain on the Riverbank</p>
<p>Several reed sheds were seen along the Suzhou Creek near Macgen Road this morning. According to a senior police officer of the Gordon Road Police Station, most of the displaced boatmen lived in the reed sheds. The number has been decreasing day by day, because the police cannot allow them to stay there for a long time. The police officer also said that if they do not immediately and voluntarily leave, the police will be forced to take necessary steps to disperse them. However, they are currently observing the development. It is said that the boat-sinking action of the Japanese Naval Special Landing Forces was to search for some terrorists. Unexpectedly, it has made about 1,500 Chinese homeless in this torrential rain.</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Comment on This</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News yesterday commented on the Japanese military spokesman's denial of the Japanese military's sinking of sampans, saying, "The Japanese spokesman may one day be able to explain to us what benefit sinking sampans in the Suzhou Creek, causing hundreds of people to suffer the hardship of displacement, will have in the process of building a 'New Order.' Now our understanding of the 'New Order' is really too little, but we firmly believe that the Japanese side's explanation will also be difficult to satisfy us. All the actions of Japan in the past four years have been unreasonable, and now they are becoming more and more intense, which really makes us think a hundred times and still cannot understand. If it is to hate the Chinese, then this action has almost reached its peak. However, what we cannot deny is that, in terms of moral standing, those with knowledge among the Japanese must recognize that this action by the Japanese side is a suicidal policy in politics. However, what we deeply regret is that these clear-headed Japanese people are only a minority. Because of the silence of these people, Japan is in trouble today. Therefore, the day when Japan can rise again in the international community must be when these people change from a minority to a majority and change from silence to daring to speak."</p>
<h3>Wei Bu Hospital Offers Free Smoking Cessation; First Group Successfully Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Weiguang Hospital's free smoking cessation program has achieved remarkable results. The first group of people who were admitted to the hospital on the 1st of this month included Zai Yunsheng, from the academic community, residing at 15 Ximen Road; Zhang Yongpei, a postal worker, residing at 114 Lane 327 Park Road; and Huang Huankui, a teacher, residing at 15 Hengqing Lane, Beile Road. All three have quit their old habits and were discharged from the hospital on the 7th. The second group, Wei Lisheng, Zhang Ruiqing, and Caballo (Portuguese), were admitted on the same day and are currently receiving treatment. It is noted that the first group also included Shen Shicai, Weng Renjie, and Zhao Jinshi, who were receiving outpatient treatment. Outpatient quitters do not stop taking drugs immediately but gradually reduce their addiction, so the withdrawal period is slightly longer than that of inpatients.</p>
<h3>Fu Pinggui Attacked in Front of the Zhonghui Bank; Fu Escapes into Armored Car; Bodyguard Zhang Lianzong Dies from a Bullet Wound</h3>
<p>Fu Pinggui, the 47-year-old son of the deceased Fu Xiaoan from Zhenhai, residing at 1189 Avenue Joffre, has been a director of the Zhonghui Bank at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Henan Road for many years. He uses an armored car for transportation and employs Zhang Lianzong as a bodyguard, who accompanies him to protect him.</p>
<p>Leaving After Work</p>
<p>At 12:10 p.m. yesterday, Fu Pinggui finished his work at the Zhonghui Bank and planned to go home with his friend for lunch. Just as he left the bank gate, his bodyguard Zhang Lianzong closely followed him. As he was about to enter the car, a young assassin, who had been lying in wait there, rushed forward and drew a pistol.</p>
<p>Seven or Eight Shots Fired</p>
<p>The assassin fired seven or eight shots at Fu in succession. At that time, Fu suddenly heard gunshots and quickly rushed into his armored car to hide, and he was not hit. However, Fu's bodyguard Zhang Lianzong saw the situation and immediately took out his pistol, intending to fight back. But his back had already been pierced by a bullet, and he fell to the ground with a wound, with blood gushing out like a spring. The assassin saw that Fu's bodyguard had been knocked down and fled in all directions, disappearing in an instant.</p>
<p>Assassin Flees</p>
<p>After the incident, the Mailand Police Station of the French Concession, which was nearby, also received the news and immediately dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives, blocking the traffic on that section of the road and conducting a search. However, the assassin had escaped into the International Settlement, and only a few shell casings were found at the scene. A car was then summoned to transport the injured Zhang Lianzong to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The police dispatched detectives to escort the victim, Fu Pinggui, home, and ordered all detectives on duty to investigate and arrest the fugitive murderer.</p>
<p>Bodyguard Dies</p>
<p>The details of the case are being thoroughly investigated by the police. However, the injured bodyguard, Zhang Lianzong, was sent to the hospital, but died of his serious injuries soon after treatment proved ineffective.</p>
<h3>A Girl Struck and Killed by a Bus</h3>
<p>Xu Erbao, a nine-year-old girl from Jiangbei, residing in a straw shed on Haig Road and Bubbling Well Road, was chasing and playing with Zheng Hai on Haig Road at 6:00 p.m. the day before yesterday when she was struck by a British-owned Route 7 bus. She was sent to the hospital but died before she could be treated. The body was sent to the coroner's office by the French Police car. Yesterday, the body was claimed by the girl's father.</p>
<h3>Inside the Threatening Letter: Two Bullets Enclosed</h3>
<p>At 8:05 AM on the 10th of this month, a letter was delivered to the residence of Mr. Cao Baogen, a cotton yarn merchant residing at No. 95, Lane 1462, Edward Road. Cao's son, Songnian, received the letter and noticed two bullets inside. Realizing it was a threatening letter from bandits, he immediately gave chase, catching up with the deliveryman, Xu Xichang, a Ningbo native, at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Avenue Foch. Together with Chinese detective Zhang Peilan and Chinese constable No. 3194, he apprehended Xu and took him to the police station. Upon opening the letter, it was found to contain no specific amount of money demanded, but instead instructed Cao to send a representative to a gambling den for negotiations, with the bearer to carry a newspaper as a signal. Xu confessed that the letter was written by Wu Fugui and that he was merely delivering it. This morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan requested a postponement to investigate accomplices. After questioning by Judge Zhong Qing, the request was granted, and Xu was ordered to be detained pending further interrogation.</p>
<p>Confucius's Teachings: The Culmination of the Five Teachings - A Speech by Shen Daling at the Rongwu Society</p>
<p>At the fifteenth lecture of the Rongwu Scripture Society, Mr. Shen Daling spoke on the teachings of Confucius, not limiting it to Confucianism. He stated that while the world often regards Confucius as the founder of Confucianism, in reality, the status of Confucianism in Ban Gu's "Book of Han: Treatise on Literature" was only one of the Nine Schools. Confucius, however, edited the Six Classics, and his subtle words and profound meaning directly inherited the hearts of Fu Xi through Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, and the Duke of Zhou. The Yao Yue chapter of the Analects, in particular, emphasized the word "zhong" (the mean), revealing the essence of Confucian learning. The Wan Zhang chapter of Mencius refers to Confucius as "the sage of the times" and "the culmination of all virtue." The Gongsun Chou chapter states, "Since the beginning of mankind, there has been no Confucius." Furthermore, Zigon said, "Since the beginning of mankind, there has been no teacher like Confucius," and You Ruo said, "Since the beginning of mankind, there has been no one more prominent than Confucius." The respect is utmost. Sima Qian revered Confucius as the "Ultimate Sage," establishing a definitive view for all ages. Therefore, the Treatise on Literature begins by saying, "After Confucius died, his subtle words ceased; after the seventy disciples passed away, the great meaning went astray." How lamentable are these words! This was likely said by Liu Xiang after collating the classics in the Seven Records, and Ban Gu adopted it.</p>
<p>Upon examining the various classics, the "Rites of Zhou" states that the "Ru" (Confucians) in the "Grand Minister of Heaven" section "obtain the people through the Way," indicating the special responsibility of Confucianism. In the "Ru Xing" (Confucian Conduct) chapter of the "Book of Rites," Confucius lists fifteen characteristics of a Confucian, concluding with the "Confucian as a sage," making Duke Ai afraid to treat Confucianism as a joke.</p>
<p>The Buddhist "Heart Sutra" speaks of "the emptiness of the five aggregates." Comparing this with the Analects, "Kong Kong Ru Ye" in the "Xian Jin" chapter and "Hui, he is almost there, repeatedly empty" suggests that Confucius did not mean "empty" as in "lacking," but rather emphasized the concept of "emptiness in the middle," which is close to what Buddhists call "emptiness." The "Six Paramitas" of the Six Degrees Sutra, especially the first degree, aligns with the Analects' Yong Ye chapter's saying that "bestowing widely and benefiting the masses is the characteristic of a sage." Giving includes giving wealth, giving strength, and giving the Dharma. "Bestowing widely" encompasses all three, not just giving wealth. Thus, it is said, "Why speak only of benevolence? It must be sagehood!" Giving wealth aligns with the Analects' Yong Ye chapter, which states, "Yuangen resigned the grain, saying, 'Give it to your neighbors and community.'" Giving strength aligns with the Analects' Yan Yuan chapter, which states, "The gentleman helps others to achieve what is good." Giving the Dharma aligns with the Analects' Shu Er chapter, which twice mentions "teaching tirelessly." "Shila," translated as "observance of precepts," aligns with the Analects' Ji Shi chapter, which condemns the "three prohibitions" of greed, anger, and ignorance. "Kshanti," translated as "patience," aligns with the Analects' Wei Linggong chapter, which states, "Impatience in small matters spoils great plans." "Virya," translated as "diligence," aligns with the Analects' Xue Er chapter, which emphasizes being "diligent in affairs," the Li Ren chapter, which emphasizes being "diligent in action," the Yang Huo chapter and the Yao Yue chapter, both emphasizing that "diligence leads to success," the Shu Er chapter, which emphasizes "learning without being tired and teaching without being weary," the Tai Bo chapter, which emphasizes "learning as if constantly falling behind, fearing lest one should lose it," and the Zi Han chapter, which states, "Advancing is my path." The Doctrine of the Mean states, "Tell Duke Ai, if others can do it once, I will do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, I will do it a thousand times." "Dhyana," or meditation, aligns with the "Great Learning" chapter of the "Book of Rites," which states, "Knowing where to rest, one can be firm; being firm, one can be tranquil; being tranquil, one can be at peace." Zhu Xi believes this aligns with Zengzi escaping Confucius's words. "Prajna," or wisdom, aligns with the Analects' Li Ren chapter, which states, "The wise benefit from benevolence," and the Zi Han and Xian Wen chapters, which state, "The wise are not deluded."

<h3>Portuguese Man Accused of Running Gambling Den: Portuguese Consulate Court Delivers Verdict - Carvalho Acquitted and Released</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Police Inspector Moore of the Shanghai Municipal Police and Deputy Inspector Blancart, some time ago, raided a gambling den in the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank building and arrested Portuguese citizen Carvalho, accusing him in the Portuguese Consulate Court of operating gambling. The Portuguese Consulate Court held a trial on Saturday and Sunday afternoon last week, presided over by Portuguese Consul-General and Judge Melo, with Mr. de Campos, Mr. Sequeira, and Mr. Souza serving as jurors. The defendant hired lawyer Ranchil to defend him. Inspector Moore and Mr. Blancart both appeared in court to recount the circumstances of the arrest. The consulate court lawyer also called a certain police officer and his wife from the Public Concession to testify, but their testimony was ineffective because the defendant's lawyer argued that the police officer and his wife were not independent witnesses. After the jury deliberated, they found the defendant not guilty, and Melo ordered Carvalho's release.</p>
<h3>Fire in Ronghua Lane: Water Shortage in the Lane</h3>
<p>And Belated Report Leads to Tragedy</p>
<p>According to the authorities of the French Concession, some irresponsible newspapers, such as tabloids, have made inaccurate reports regarding the case of the fire in Ronghua Lane, Rue Massenet on the 7th of this month, which resulted in several deaths. The problem that caused the incident was the lack of water in the lane. The authorities of the French Concession have several points that should be brought to the attention of residents regarding the incident: (1) The "bull's head" (fire hydrant) does not belong to the lane. The water for firefighting is supplied directly by the company and is exclusively for the use of the Fire Brigade. (2) The French Concession has never restricted water usage. (3) Firefighters arrived on the scene to put out the fire immediately after receiving the report and did not feel any water shortage. At that time, because the fire was very large, eight large hoses were used to put out the fire. At that time, more than thirty workers were trapped in the fire, and the firefighters bravely rescued more than twenty-three of them. The reason why the fire could not be extinguished immediately was that the incident occurred at 5:00 AM, and the person responsible for the carelessness could not borrow a telephone, resulting in a belated report. (4) Although the destroyed factory had fire extinguishers and water bucket facilities, the fire spread too quickly, making it impossible to use them.</p>
<h3>Unexpected Calamity While Getting a Haircut</h3>

<h3>Husband Has Another Lover: Wife Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>Sun Guoying, an 18-year-old woman from Ningbo, married Zheng Mianzhi (27 years old) from Guangdong. They rented a residence at No. 6, Mingde Lane, Avenue Foch. Initially, their relationship was very close, but recently, after learning that Zheng had another lover, their marital love deteriorated. Sun would not allow Zheng to stay out late every night. If he returned late, they would argue. On the night of the 10th, Zheng went out again and did not return until midnight, causing Sun to become dissatisfied and attempt suicide. She poisoned herself that night. It was not until noon the next day that Zheng discovered her. He sent her to the First Hospital of the Red Cross, but it was too late to save her. Zheng retrieved her body from the coroner and sent it to the funeral home for preparation.</p>
<h3>Farmers Picking Broad Beans in the Countryside: Wall Collapses, All Injured</h3>
<p>Lu Fuxiang, a 39-year-old local farmer from the Hu Family Residence in Hongqiao Road, Shanghai West, usually grows and sells vegetables for a living.

<h3>Robberies Occur in Four Locations</h3>
<p>Yongkang Pawnshop: The robber Tang Yonggen, in the morning of the day before yesterday, hid a Mauser pistol and two pairs of handcuffs and broke into the Yongkang Pawnshop at No. 255 Kaifeng Road. He first handcuffed four employees of the pawnshop and then opened the safe, stealing 978 yuan in cash and 243 pieces of jewelry. He escaped through the back door and was intercepted by Chinese constables as soon as he reached the entrance of the alley.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Special Education Committee Publishes Report (4): A Glimpse of the Recommendations</h3>
<p>For ease of reference, the various recommendations are briefly listed below: (1) The educational responsibility of the Public Concession primarily belongs to the resident communities of various countries, and the decision rests with the Municipal Council. (2) The Municipal Council's educational policy should move towards expanding the subsidy system, increasing the number of schools for expatriates of various countries, and strictly limiting direct educational facilities. (3) The current restriction on educational funding should be clearly abolished, and sufficient funding should be temporarily allocated to maintain the educational work currently in progress. (4) The allocation of educational funding for Chinese, Japanese, and foreign schoolchildren should be proportional to the donations paid by residents of each nationality. (5) Once the financial situation improves, educational funding should be increased beyond the minimum amount stipulated in Section 3. The additional funding should be used in a way that facilitates the application of the principles included in Section 4. (6) The proposal to transfer existing Municipal Council schools to expatriate organizations, while logically consistent with the principles of Sections 1, 2, and 4, is not feasible under the current circumstances. (7) The allocation of subsidies can be freely handled by the Subsidy Subcommittee under more flexible conditions, to implement and support special education programs that benefit the entire Public Concession, and to assist existing schools. (8) Subsidies should not be given to for-profit schools. (9) Schools receiving subsidies may be inspected by the Education Department. (10) The direct expenses of Municipal Council schools should be offset as much as possible by tuition revenue, but without placing hardship on parents. (11) The position of Director of Education should be retained after the current Director retires.</p>
<p>Current System</p>
<p>All Municipal Council schools and educational administration maintain their high level of efficiency. The Director of Education is about to retire. After his retirement, whether his successor should be appointed or whether the position should be left vacant, with the Chinese and Western educational supervisors responsible for handling Chinese and Western schools and allocating subsidies respectively, all of this has been discussed by this committee. As a result, the committee believes that the position of Director of Education should be retained to manage educational affairs in general. Otherwise, once the organization and responsibilities are divided, the efficiency of internal administration and external management will be impaired. However, to save expenses, all foreign assistants in the Education Department could be abolished.</p>
<p>Regarding the subsidy system, the committee's views are as follows:</p>
<p>A. The committee authorized to approve subsidies should be given the freedom to dispose of subsidies under more flexible conditions, unrestricted by previous allocation methods, and to allocate a portion of the subsidies for special projects that benefit the public, such as:</p>
<p>(1) Rewarding and assisting independent organizations, charitable organizations, and individuals in establishing primary schools in areas of the Public Concession with insufficient school facilities.</p>
<p>(2) Establishing a basic hygiene course in primary schools for poor children.</p>
<p>(3) Cooperating with the Industrial and Social Affairs Department to conduct industrial and technical training.</p>
<p>(4) Adding special vocational training classes in secondary schools.</p>
<p>(5) Assisting schools in experimenting with improvements in teaching methods.</p>
<p>B. Subsidies should not be given to any schools whose purpose is to seek private gain.</p>
<p>C. Schools receiving Municipal Council subsidies, in addition to being inspected by the Health, Public Works, and Fire Departments, may be inspected by the Education Department.</p>
<p>Due to the decline in exchange rates and the rise in commodity prices, the cost of maintaining Municipal Council schools must increase. Therefore, the committee does not recommend any large-scale austerity measures. Eighty-two percent of the expenditure listed in last year's education budget was for the salaries of teachers and staff (including pensions). A large portion of these are bound by contracts, making it difficult to reduce them. Unless staff are laid off or salaries are reduced, expenses cannot be reduced. The implementation of layoffs must sacrifice efficiency, and salary reductions will affect the standards of appointing teachers and teaching. The committee believes that some savings can be achieved by replacing the Western principals of Chinese schools with Chinese personnel. The Municipal Council has already established this as a policy.</p>
<p>Regarding tuition fees, the committee believes that the direct expenses of Municipal Council schools should be offset as much as possible by tuition revenue, but without placing hardship on student parents.</p>
<p>Appendix: Memorandum from Chinese Committee Members to the Special Committee</p>
<p>(1) The Municipal Council has a moral obligation to provide educational facilities for the children of taxpayers (regardless of nationality), and from the perspective of overall social welfare, it is hoped that the Municipal Council will provide such facilities as much as possible. (2) The Municipal Council's current education policy has a dual approach:</p>
<p>(1) Establishing public schools. (2) Subsidizing private schools. The committee believes that this policy should not be changed in the future with regard to Chinese education. Municipal Council schools should serve as a model for private schools in terms of improving teaching methods and sound management. The subsidy system should aim to raise the standards of private schools. (3) The allocation of education funding between Chinese and Western schools should be more equitable. In any average allocation method, attention should be paid to two aspects: the amount of taxes paid by Chinese and foreigners and the number of enrolled children. (4) In the autumn semester of the year, the Municipal Council Chinese schools, including night schools, had a total of 8,479 registered students. According to the 1935 survey, there were 149,542 Chinese school-age children (between the ages of five and fifteen) in the Public Concession (excluding the area outside the concession roads). It can be seen that the Chinese school-age children attending Municipal Council schools account for only 5.7% of the total. As for the Western school-age children in the Public Concession, including the area outside the concession roads, according to the above survey, there were 5,405. In the autumn semester of last year, there were 1,287 registered students in the Western public schools, accounting for 35% of the total. From this, it can be seen that the Municipal Council has not assumed the primary responsibility for educating Chinese children. Therefore, the committee proposes that Chinese education funding should be increased and Chinese schools should be added to reach at least 10% of Chinese school-age children attending Municipal Council schools, in order to eliminate the above-mentioned inequality. (5) In 1934, education funding was stipulated not to exceed the income equal to 2% of the tax collection rate. This method has not been changed. When this principle was applied in 1935, the tax rate was 14%. But now the tax rate has been increased, so the above restriction rate should also be increased, at least to reach the previous ratio of 1/7. (End)</p>

<h3>A New Reason for Ideological Divorce</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>If you go to Norway, which has already fallen, and hear a couple divorcing because of "political differences," don't be surprised. Because this has already been "officially announced."</p>
<p>Today, among couples in Norway, if one party does not support Hitler or Quisling, opposes Nazi philosophy, and opposes the Norwegian puppet regime, hoping for a British victory, the other party can immediately file for divorce.</p>
<p>This is certainly a "benevolent policy" for husbands or wives whose feelings have already broken down or who have new loves; however, a government that needs to use such means of controlling thought to make the people "content" only reveals the flaws in its ideology.</p>
<p>Looking further ahead, in history, it seems that no one has "ever seen before" those who can use armed force to stop social progress and permanently suppress the freedom of thought within the reasonable scope of the people.</p>
<p>Correspondance</p>
<h3>Xu Beihong in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>In times of peace, the actions of some artists have long been noticed, but in times when the country is at war with foreign countries, they are actually even more missed. The famous painter Mr. Xu Beihong, in the first year of the outbreak of the war, moved to Chongqing with National Central University. When passing through Hankou, he was dragged by Guo Moruo and insisted on asking him to serve as the head of the Art Section of the First Hall of the Political Department. Professor Xu, dressed in a blue cloth shirt, felt somewhat out of place entering the heavily guarded armed zone. Therefore, he quietly slipped to Chongqing and returned to his old profession.</p>
<p>In the first year of the war (1938), Indian poet Tagore sent a telegram inviting Mr. Xu to teach at the Indian International University. On the way, he happened to encounter the fall of Guangzhou. The disruption of transportation trapped him in the Xijiang River basin for more than 40 days. Later, he finally detoured to Hong Kong and then took a boat to India. From then on, Professor Xu held four consecutive painting exhibitions in Singapore, Calcutta, and other places, selling all his old paintings for more than 500,000 yuan. He donated all the proceeds to refugees and overseas Chinese who were enthusiastic about their motherland. This was already well known. The exhibitions that Professor Xu held in Southeast Asia this time were all very successful. The most significant point was that "every penny was returned to the public." No wonder the overseas Chinese were greatly moved and actively contributed! Those exhibitions were:</p>
<p>In March 1939, a painting exhibition was held in Singapore, with an income of 13,700 Straits dollars, equivalent to more than 120,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>In February 1941, a painting exhibition was held in Kuala Lumpur, with an income of 17,800 Straits dollars, equivalent to more than 150,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>In March 1941, a painting exhibition was held in Ipoh, with an income of 10,000 Straits dollars, equivalent to more than 80,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>In April 1941, a painting exhibition was held in Penang, with an income of 12,000 Straits dollars, equivalent to more than 100,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>The total income from the above four painting exhibitions was nearly 500,000 yuan in national currency, setting an unprecedented record for the income of individual painting exhibitions by national painters. The reason for such achievements was obviously because Professor Xu's profound art had long been admired by people from all walks of life; the second reason was that the overseas Chinese were enthusiastic about loving their country and actively contributed; and the third reason was that Professor Xu insisted on donating all the income to refugees, while his personal travel expenses, living expenses, and the mounting costs of each painting were all raised by Professor Xu personally. This spirit has created a unique brilliance in the Chinese art world. Recalling the large couplet hanging in Professor Xu's studio, collected from the Stone Scripture of Mount Tai: "Unique prejudice, acting willfully," one can know Mr. Xu's character and his constant practice of doing what he says, not conforming to vulgarity, especially this kind of good deed of pleading for refugees, which further demonstrates his broad compassion.</p>
<p>In addition to these painting exhibitions, Professor Xu also held one solo exhibition each in Calcutta and the International University during his stay in India. The painting exhibition in Calcutta was even presided over by the 80-year-old poet Tagore himself, of course, the scene was unprecedented. Later, Professor Xu went to the Himalayas for a sketch trip and completed the large composition "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains" oil painting.</p>
<p>It is said that recently, the National Art Committee of the Ministry of Education has invited Professor Xu to serve as a standing committee member and is urging Mr. Xu to return to China to preside over the association's affairs.</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>Clothing Helps Psychological Health</h3>
<p>— Jin Guang</p>
<p>Those who have read Ms. Ying's article "I Don't Look Like a College Student" in the "Free Talk" on May 10th are probably rarely unmoved and express sympathy for her. In this bustling city, it is really not easy to find many college students like Ms. Ying who only know how to work hard and do not seek to dress beautifully.</p>
<p>From a simple principle, I personally have no objection to Ms. Ying's proposition. However, from the perspective of human relationships, social customs, and psychological health, I think Ms. Ying's opinion is worth examining.</p>
<p>We can certainly laugh at those women who specialize in using permed hair, manicured nails, strange clothes, and high-heeled leather shoes as symbols of the "new era" and "progress." But we must know that: (1) human beings are always eager to gather; (2) although there are no clear regulations on the clothing and attire of various people in society, there are considerable divisions and distinctions in the invisible; (3) loneliness is unhealthy from the perspective of psychological health.</p>
<p>When you go to the road, you can see that this one is a worker, that one is a nanny, this one is an apprentice, that one is a dancer, this one is a student, that one is a businessman... Why? Because their clothing and attire can be recognized invisibly. In a group of modern women, would they not find it strange if a woman dressed in rural clothes suddenly appeared? In a group of detectives, could everyone get along with a beggar who was ragged and haggard? It would probably be very difficult; in addition to being a place to study, school should also be a place to make friends (of course, not referring to drinking buddies). It is not smart to sacrifice friends for the sake of distinctive clothing.</p>
<p>In the past, girls from seven or eight to a dozen years old always wore braids, while married women wore buns, which also had considerable regulations in the invisible. Now, although most women have cut their hair, the style of their hair often varies with age. It is as unpleasant for an old woman in her forties or fifties to keep a "childlike" hairstyle as it is for a three- or four-year-old child to have a "plane-like" perm. Being considered a monster because of the different hairstyle and therefore not getting along with people, and often feeling uneasy in the heart, this is also an unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p>Human beings are conservative, and changes in customs, changes in hairstyles, and even wearing a newly made dress often require considerable courage. At first, it is often felt unnatural, but over time it becomes comfortable. Of course, I don't want Ms. Ying to spend a lot of time and money to change into a "college student"; but within the scope of not violating the principle of simplicity, adapting to the environment, making yourself look more like a college student on the outside, and not giving up the beautiful soul, is more reasonable from the perspective of psychological health.</p>
<p>I think there is a big difference between "looking like a college student" and extravagance, and a pleasing appearance and a beautiful soul can be taken into account.</p>

<h3>One-Armed Rickshaw Puller</h3>
<p>— Wei Yan</p>
<p>One day, at dusk, I hailed a rickshaw from the Public Concession to the French Concession. Because I had to rush to teach evening classes, I was afraid of being late. In the sound of a group of rickshaw pullers vying for a price, I agreed to a lower price and hurriedly sat down. I didn't know that after walking a few steps, I suddenly noticed that the rickshaw puller only had one hand pulling, and the other side was using a rope from under his arm to help on his neck. I was surprised and asked him why he only had one hand. Since one hand was broken, why did he still pull the rickshaw? Seeing that I had questions, he told me about his life while running. He said that he used to be a soldier, and he broke one of his hands because of a certain war. Later, the army disbanded, and he returned to his hometown to do some small business, and a family of several people barely survived. He didn't know that after a few years, the second war broke out again. He was found to have been a soldier before and fought in battles, so his whole family suffered. He held his young son with one hand and fled to Shanghai. He had no capital and no expertise. Because he had one hand, he charged less than others; but he would rather I take a few more trips so that his daily income could support both father and son. When I got out of the car, I gave him a little more money, and he refused three times before accepting it.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) Perceptible Friendship</p>
<p>When Yuan Shaowen sent Begonia to this hospital, although he did not tell people his real name and Begonia's real name, the doctors guessed that there must be a reason why such a young person suddenly suffered such a terrible knife wound on his face.</p>
<p>"This gentleman's wound is really troublesome. Even if it doesn't rot or fester, it may not be without scars, and that eye is still a big problem," said the doctor wearing glasses, frowning.</p>
<p>At the same time, the female nurse put a white pill into Begonia's mouth, but before she could bring a glass of cold water to his lips, the pill had already been spat out of the patient's mouth.</p>
<p>"I don't want to eat this"! He said firmly: "Doctor, please have mercy on me and give me some sleeping pills to drink"!</p>
<p>"Don't do this, Yuqin! Let's talk slowly"! Shaowen hurriedly lowered his head to comfort him.</p>
<p>"Taking this pill will make you feel no pain"! The doctor said.</p>
<p>Begonia closed his eyes quickly and bit his lips tightly.</p>
<p>"Brother, you're deliberately blaming me..."! Shaowen only said one sentence and then swallowed it. "Doctor, Miss", then turned around and said to the doctor and the female nurse standing opposite him: "Can you please go out for a while and let me enlighten my younger brother a few more words? Young people always get angry when they suffer losses; if they don't calm down first, taking medicine is useless. Right"?</p>
<p>The doctor smiled and took the nurse out.</p>
<p>"Brother", Shaowen stood straight in front of Begonia's bed, and regardless of whether his eyes were open or not, he said in an extremely sincere tone: (104)</p>
<h3>Firefighting Anti-Aircraft Gun Team</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>Recently, the international situation has become increasingly tense, and the war zone has expanded. The American people are aware that if this continues, the war is likely to spread to the New World, so the mood for preparing for war is extremely warm. The Fire Brigade of Piston City, Maryland, in order to prevent problems before they occur, has specially organized a firefighting anti-aircraft gun team, installing anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns on the fire trucks. In the future, when war occurs, when fire trucks are irrigating areas that have been bombed and caught fire, the firefighting anti-aircraft team can cope with it easily.</p>

<p>Entertainment Circle</p>
<h3>Recording Listening to Opera at Carlton</h3>
<p>— Sick Dove</p>
<p>On the third day at the Carlton stage, the repertoire included Yan Xiaopeng's *Tie Long Shan* (Iron Cage Mountain), Zhang Yiyun's *Shisan Mei* (Thirteenth Sister), and Yan Jupeng's *Ma Cao Dai Changting* (Scolding Cao at Changting), all of which were carefully crafted. *Tie Long Shan* places the greatest emphasis on style, something that martial artists today see as a daunting task. Yan Xiaopeng is of a good height, but unfortunately his bone structure is not abundant enough, and he lacks presence. Although this play is an opening face play for martial artists, it is different from martial artists. It does not excel in martial arts but focuses on posture. The initial entry should be steady and skilled, and the gestures should be generous. Every move, every step, every leap, has prescribed dimensions and must be skillfully in accordance with the movements. The helmet and armor on the body should be kept from disorder. The person should be agile, quiet, and solemn, and should not lose the majesty of a great general at any point. The aura should be vigorous, the performance should be dignified, and the enunciation of the lines should be divided into three sections. The upper section uses a recessive tone to bring out the words from a calm state, gaining a heroic spirit to express his majesty. The middle section is purely practiced with middle qi, and the words burst out from anger, with not losing calmness as the principle. The last section uses a heart-felt tone, making the rhyme mournful. Only such lines can be called first-rate. This can be discussed with experts, but it is not for outsiders to talk about. Yan Xiaopeng learned this play from Ding Yongquan. The postures and lines are still not bad, only the qi and complexion are slightly weaker. *Shisan Mei* is a laborious play for female actors, also relying on lines, body movements, and expressions as three key elements. Zhang Yiyun was on stage for the first time, but she was surprisingly competent. Her Beijing dialect was excellent, and her emotions were all good. In the wedding persuasion scene, her delicate anger was just right, making people feel as if they were tasting a fruit of remonstrance, with a lingering aftertaste. In terms of expression, there were several places that secretly resembled her elder sister, probably due to what she had heard and seen. Her appearance was beautiful, and her height was moderate. Qing Feng has such achievements, which is really not easy. The final act of *Ma Cao* is Yan Jupeng's masterpiece. In the opening section, the original tune of "Ping Sheng Zhi Qi…" (Life's Ambitions…), the two words "Ping Sheng" (Life) are pulled high, full of the sound of the Tan school. The two words "Feng Yun" (Wind and Cloud) are very skillful. The word "Feng" has a plosive sound, and the word "Yun" is powerfully received. In the second scene, the second-sixth tune of "Ya Dang Chao" (Pressing Down on the Court), the singing becomes tighter and tighter. The three words "Ba Ba Ba" (Enough, Enough, Enough) are like rain hitting plantain leaves, clean and pleasant to listen to. The long passage of lines in the third scene is completed in one breath, especially the sentence "Jiu Feng Zhi Ji Qian Bei Shao" (A thousand cups of wine are too few when meeting a friend), each word goes high, and the enunciation is extremely clear. It is said that even a sage like Shu Yan could not avoid one or two incorrect words in this passage. In the last sentence, "Ming Zhi Shan You Hu Pian Xiang Hu Shan Xing" (Knowing there are tigers on the mountain, I prefer to walk on the tiger mountain), the word "Pian" (Prefer) is read correctly in the yinping tone. The fast board of "Xi Ri Li" (In the past), the rhyme is witty and the mouth is full of strength. The inverted board of "Gan Chen Dang Dao Mou Han Chao" (Treacherous officials conspire against the Han Dynasty) is sung high into the clouds. The following original tune is ordinary and unremarkable. The three drum rolls are extremely skillful, calm, and refined, with the sound of metal and stone, because his skills were taught by Chen Yanheng, which is naturally extraordinary. Looking at Jupeng's play as a whole, his singing is better than his acting, but a few of the exits can still be seen. When scolding Cao Cao and Zhang Liao, his eyes and face are all acting, which can well describe the scene of Mi Zhengping, who relied on his talent and arrogance at the time. Although his voice is narrow, the high notes are still clear, loud and easy to listen to, not losing the characteristics of the Yu school.</p>
<h3>Gu Lan Jun Awaiting Childbirth</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun is already heavily pregnant. In "Home," she plays the role of a pregnant Juexin's wife. A big belly playing a big belly is quite interesting. Although "Home" has only been filming for half a month, in order to allow Lanjun to rest and await childbirth as soon as possible, the Guolian authorities are trying to start filming Juexin's wife's scenes as early as possible. It is reported that Lanjun's work on the film has been 19/20 completed, and it will be completed in two or three days. Thus, Lanjun's work under the silver screen will wait until after giving birth. "Home" is no less than her epoch-making work.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Entertainment Circle</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Hu Die originally intended to retire from the silver screen and had published a notice in the Hong Kong newspapers. However, recently, due to the strong invitation of Luo, a magnate of the Huasheng Company in Hong Kong, it is heard that she has agreed to shoot another fashion film. The title of the play has been decided as "Blood and Tears of Xiangsi Village." The director will probably still be Wang Cilong.</p>
<p>Director Fei Mu's historical film "Confucius" has been shipped to New York and will soon be officially screened in the largest theater there.</p>
<p>The Oriental Hotel Repertory Theater is currently selecting the world's top ten famous plays and plans to invite famous actors and directors from the film and theater circles to guest direct in rotation. The company is currently working day and night to compile the script.</p>
<p>Yao Ping came to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 7th of this month. After staying for a while, she returned to Hong Kong. It is heard that the mission of this trip was to sign a contract to purchase 100,000 Hong Kong dollars worth of film on behalf of a certain company in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Qiao Qi, who recently performed in the play "Crossroads" at the Tianfeng Drama Club, has formally joined Jin Xing and has signed a one-year contract. However, Qiao Qi himself said that he will still continue to perform on the stage in the future.</p>
<p>The literary film "Home," jointly produced by all the directors and actors of Guolian, has been filmed to 7/10 completion and will soon be screened simultaneously at the Huguang and Xinguang cinemas, and the ticket prices will be slightly increased.</p>
<h3>Symphony of Film and Theater</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>Li Qinian's third work, "The Merry Widow," immediately won a lot of audience praise and restored her past glory because it was full of new and exciting situations. Originally, the Yi Hua authorities planned to shoot "Waterloo Bridge", but they were afraid that it would fail again due to not matching Li Qinian's personality. Therefore, in order to rival "The Merry Widow", they decided to shoot another film with the same theme. The title of the play has been internally decided as "Bandit Beauty", which will still be written by Ye Yifang, describing a social butterfly entering and leaving the nobility, subverting many gentlemen and comprador classes. In fact, she is a thief who steals valuable ornaments! At the same time, the director of "Bandit Beauty" has also been internally decided as Li Pingqian, the director of "The Merry Widow".</p>
<p>The Meicheng Company has decided to restart film production from next month. In the middle, there was a plan to shoot "Hong Xuanjiao", but it has now been abandoned. However, the plan for film production is still in active preparation. In order to cultivate newcomers, it has been decided to employ all newcomers who have never been on the stage or screen. Currently, dance queens Wang Lingling, Zhou Jin, and Li Guiqin have been discovered. The initial work is to train Mandarin and then rehearse the stage play "A Flock of Orioles Flying," to increase experience. As for the film script, Fei Mu is invited to write it and take on the directing duties.</p>
<p>Yue Feng obtained the title of "Romance Director" after the completion of "Spring Breeze Returns to Dream". He is now rushing to shoot another romance film, "Blue Sea and Blue Sky", in order to be shown at Huguang after "The Merry Widow". His next work has been decided to be "Waterloo Bridge of Qiujiang", and the heroine of the film will be Yuan Meiyun.</p>
<p>Tianfeng Theatre will perform Wu Ren's directed "Shanghai to Yue Xia" in the next issue, saying that it will be performed in various local dialects. In this way, after the Green Treasure Theatre put forward the slogan of civilizing drama and making drama, Tianfeng also followed suit in advocating the doctrine of civilizing drama in drama!</p>

<h3>Blood Rain of Exquisite Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Eight: Fallen Flowers Intend to Follow the Flowing Water</p>
<p>I've long considered discussing this with Wang Yongtai, exposing their secrets. Perhaps tomorrow, I'll use this scented silk handkerchief as proof, press Wang Yongtai for an explanation, and advise him to deal with the adulterous woman and wanton wife swiftly, and to seek a better path. There are many beautiful women in the world, why must it be her? Xu Jing, having decided on this plan, placed the scented silk handkerchief in the drawer and closed his eyes to sleep. The next morning, he rose early, washed, and after breakfast, he took the scented silk handkerchief and went to Wang Yongtai's study. He saw Wang Yongtai sitting in a chair, gazing up at the ceiling, lost in thought. He quietly walked in, stood up straight, and called out, "Uncle." Wang Yongtai turned his face and saw Xu Jing. Usually, he would greet him with a smile, saying, "Nephew, please sit down," but today he ignored him, neither seeing nor hearing him, coldly indifferent. Xu Jing couldn't help but be stunned; his mouth wanted to speak but stammered, his feet wanted to advance but hesitated. Xu Jing was truly in an awkward situation. But then he thought, what did I come here to do? Regardless of Wang Yongtai's attitude, I should speak truthfully and directly. Perhaps something unpleasant has happened to him. So, he mustered his courage, took out the scented silk handkerchief, and handed it to Wang Yongtai on the table with both hands, saying resolutely, "Uncle, please listen. I have a very important and secret matter concerning this handkerchief that I must report to you. I offer my loyal advice, speaking from the bottom of my heart, and ask for your wise judgment." Xu Jing said these words, expecting Wang Yongtai to surely ask him about the reason, but who knew that Wang Yongtai would give him a cold laugh and shake his hand, saying, "No need to say it, I already know everything." Xu Jing was startled by these words, wondering how Wang Yongtai knew everything. Wang Yongtai continued, "An honest man does not do things in secret. You are a man of integrity, how can you not cherish yourself? You should not be confused by your nature, acting boldly and recklessly. Since you have committed a mistake, you should seek repentance to atone for your transgression. Why try to conceal your faults, wanting to cover up what is already exposed? You don't need to tell me anything." When Wang Yongtai said this, Xu Jing was greatly alarmed, knowing that Wang Yongtai had misunderstood him. How could he not defend himself? So, he said again, "Uncle, please allow me to explain the details, and you will understand that I have no other intention, but am entirely for your benefit." Wang Yongtai did not wait for him to finish speaking, but loudly said, "I already understand, why do you need to say more? You are young and have a long future ahead of you. Take care to live your life well. I cannot keep you here any longer, why say more?" After saying these words, Wang Yongtai flicked his sleeves, stood up, and walked out, presumably to the yamen.

<h3>Abstract of the Philosophy of Vigorous Practice</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>The first priority in life is to eliminate obstacles, moving from recognition to adaptation, from adaptation to control, and from control to utilization. The second is to create happiness, taking the whole as a premise and small steps as a method. While it cannot make up for the flaws of reality, these flaws are precisely the object of continuous human effort.</p>
