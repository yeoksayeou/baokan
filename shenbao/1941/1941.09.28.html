<h3 id="c16">英國應立皀出擊 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>納粹軍在基輔獲得局部勝利後、即以兩枝重兵，分向卡科夫城及克里米亞半島疾進，俾一方完成對於整個烏克蘭的控制，一方準備進窺高加索的油田，同時北路德軍亦加緊向列寗格勒城進撲，據德方自稱，攻陷該城，當爲旦夕間事；雖然列髯格勒的得失或克里米亞的危急，均不足以成爲德蘇戰局中的決定因素，但爲及時牽掣德軍兵力，阻止其在蘇聯境內繼續掠奪作戰資源起見。英國無論基於援蘇或自衛觀點，均有立即在各綫發動反攻的絕對必要。</p>
<p>希特勒原是侵略能手，他在對蘇作戰期中。絕未忽略對於其他方面的必要佈置，美日談話期間的加緊剽襲美國船艦，即已充分證明他雖在全力應付東綫戰事，却並未忘記在西綫替他的遠東盟友「助威」；這幾天隨着烏飛蘭戰局的開展，他的軍事地位既有顯著進步。當然更有餘力去顧及其他方面並佈置新的行動。根據連日電訊，他的活動對象至少有三：（一）慫恿保加利亞對蘇宣戰，同時壓迫土耳其准許德軍假道，俾一方得和克里米亞前綫的德車，會攻高加索，一方更能進窺伊期，以切斷英蘇兩國在近東一帶的聯絡綫；（二）會同義大利向北菲利比亞增兵，以備於必要時重向埃及發動攻勢；（三）趁着東綫小勝的喘息機會。回過頭來從新壓迫維希；以求貫澈「法德軍事合作」的宿夢，換言之，即要求利用法屬菲洲港口（允其是達加爾港）及法國殘餘艦隊，以威脅英美。</p>
<p>上面三種活動，雖然形式上各小關聯，其實息息相通，例如土耳其如果屈服，不但黑海流域易生劇變，即近東諸國亦將連帶發生波動，屆時里比亞的德義聯軍當然乘機東進，藉以牽掣準備北上援蘇的英國中東軍主力，此其一；如果維希也跟着屈服。而把比塞達，加薩勃朗加，甚至達加爾諸港，聽任德軍使用，則軸心國在菲洲和地中海的勢力，既將日趨膨脹，其對於英美的威脅勢必立即加重，結果所屆、也必然影響到紅軍的持久抗戰，此其二一。無疑地，比塞達港倘爲德方所使用，則軸心對北菲的軍事運輸，祇須自西西利島直放該港，中間相隔不過一衣帶水，將使英國在地中海上的封鎖，歸於無效至於達加爾港之成爲德國海空根據地，則更將使美國接濟近東和蘇聯的運輸綫，受到更大的阻撓。</p>
<p>由此可見近日希特勒在對蘇戰事以外所進行的各種佈置，其用心均非常毒辣，祗要有一處得手，對於民治陣綫的軍事外交，都足夠引起極端不利的後果，因此爲未雨綢繆計，英美兩國，允其是已和蘇聯訂盟而有駢飛肩作戰義務的英國，必須及早在每個可能的未來戰錢，爭取主動，絕對不應再讓希特勒捷足先登。據隔昨消息，英美兩國已以飛機戰具接濟土耳其，同時又傳英國名將華維爾已在伊朗編成遠征軍，準備協助紅軍保衛高加索：此二說雖可予人以若干寬慰，並多少證明英國己在準備行動，但無論如何，仍嫌其過於遲緩，且使人獲有臨渴掘井的印象。因寫事實上蘇聯獨力抗戰，已超過三個月無論美國接濟如何艱難，無論英國準備如何欠缺，似乎不應該除了若干有限的接濟之外，別無其他行動，以直接牽掣納粹作戰計劃，並分散其兵力。如果必須等至紅軍繼續遭受若干挫折，以致戰事波及近東或其他方面之後、再來籌議補苴之計，豈不又要走上過去斷送巴爾幹的覆轍？因此吾人第一希望日內將在莫斯科舉行的三國會議，能在討論物資接濟問題之外，特別注意於聯合作戰方案的確定與實施，其决更望英國政府能夠當機立斷，迅赴事機，切勿冉使全世界反侵略陣綫重溫過去民治國被逐個擊破的慘痛經騐。</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>論到軟木櫧樹的木材，除了皮中包含着「鞣質」可以鞣皮或作染料外，只好燒火沒有別的用處，因爲它的木質很沉重，容易總裂，又容易腐朽。這不由的叫我想起莊子人間世的一段文字：『匠石之齊「至於曲轅，見「櫟社」樹：其大蔽牛，絜之百園，……觀者如市！匠石不顧，遂行不輟，弟子　觀之，走及匠石曰：「自吾執斧斤以隨夫子，未嘗見材如此其美也！先生不肯視，行不輟何也。」曰「巳矣！勿復言矣！散木也：以爲舟則沉，以爲棺槨則速腐，以為器則速毀，以為門戶則液漫，以為柱則螜，是不材之木也，……」我以為這所說的「櫟」，止是「軟木櫧」：因為只有它的木材有這幾種特性，餘外的櫟料的木質，全是非常堅緻和牢固，正是頂好的營造材料哩。無論怎樣吧：軟木儲的木材雖不足道，而出產軟木的這種特長，却是任何種樹所不敢望其項背的！所以在莊子那時把它看作「散木」，「不材之木」，而現在却成了「良木」，「異木」，是任何種樹木所不能越俎代庖的：也可見天地之間懷抱異奇才之士，雖不為人所知，　　不得志，最後總有穎脫而出嶄露頭角之一日啊！（完）、</p>

<p>英美商人　擁護不懈</p>
<p>大陸報消息、上海主要外商與銀行家刻正研究有建設性之辦法、以襄助解決近因外匯統制條例而引起之許多難題、聞彼等已於過去一週內、數度舉行試探性之會議、希望能採取若干切實計劃、以解決困難之外匯問題、會議結果、昨日（二十六日）尙無確切消息可得、但據傳聞、至少有某一國之旅滬進出口商人、將有切實行動、昨據記者向各方徵詢所悉、目光遠大之主要英美商人、巳逐漸贊成外匯統制條例之動機與旨趣、咸覺有取嚴峻統制辦法之必要、俾能完成中美英三國政府在政治外交與金融上之目標、</p>

<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>五·七·八·九·幾個恥月，巳先後悄悄的逝去了！冉冉降臨的，是一個光榮鮮明的飛十月」</p>
<p>「十月」，在新中國的歷史上，是凝結着烈士們的血花，是充滿着蓬勃向榮的朝氣。</p>
<p>中華民國三十初度的誕辰—國慶節—將從艱苦卓絕中來臨，「十月十日」，是一個怎樣偉大的節日！想來小朋友們，也必然記得很淸楚的。</p>
<p>耶穌爲了拯救世人，被殺人不眨眼的惡魔，用殘忍的手段，將他釘死在「十字架」上。然而耶穌的軀壳雖死，耶穌的博愛救世精神，却光爭日月，垂諸千秋而不滅。蓋正有無數的耶穌，循着血染十字架的路，邁步前進，爲人羣自由，博愛而奮鬥。於是乎「耶穌是我救主」的歌頌，響澈　　，普遍字宙。筆者在這裏，要問一聲小朋友們，大家面迎快將來臨的「十月」，究竟誰是我們中華民族的救星？誰是我們的救苦救難的耶穌？請你們自己去尋求答案。最須記取的。是小朋友們，要有救世救人的「十」字精神！</p>
<h3 id="c86">日蝕的故事 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>百年難遇的日蝕，已於上星期日呈現在我們的眼前；雖然天空多雲，不能淸晰觀察，但是在浮雲疏散的一刹那，可以見到月影掩日的奇象，還算是幸運的事。在那時候，你們還聽得過人家敲鑼，放鞭爆的聲音嗎？他們可曾吿訴你們關於「野日吃家日」或「天狗吃日頭」一類迷信的話嗎？但是你們讀過了本刊的「日蝕的觀察和實騐」和「日蝕是怎樣？」以後，還會相信什麼「野日」或「天狗」嗎？我知道細心觀察和動手實騐過的小朋友，一定可以尋得它的眞理的。</p>
<p>這裹再介紹兩個關於日蝕的故事給你們：</p>
<p>增加一天工錢：從前南非洲的納塔耳地方，許多開礦的工人，正在礦塲上做工，忽然太陽躱了起來，頓時變成了黑暗的世界。過了一會，太陽又從黑暗中露出臉來，依舊照耀着大地。這樣，在無知的工人們看來，當然覺得非常奇怪的。所以在領取工錢的時候，大家包圍着主人，要求增加一天工錢。他們說：「我們已經做了兩天的工，因爲當中有夜間隔着。」</p>
<p>延緩兩個禮拜：到六五四年，又遇到一次日蝕。巴黎的許多人民，都擁到敎堂裏，爭向牧師懺悔，以求免災。那牧師坐在一間小室裏，聽他們一一懺悔。最後，他是失眠，疲勞，機餓到耐不住了，便走出來，對敎徒們大喊道：「兄弟們！因爲這决的人太多了，天文家巳經議決把日蝕延緩兩個禮拜。」</p>
<p>小朋友們！看了上面的故事，覺得很好笑嗎？但是現代的人，看見了日蝕，鳴鑼擊鼓，燒香點燭，更是憑蠢；而那些「野日」「天狗」的話，不是更荒謬嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c87">兒童與音樂 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>近年以來，上海的兒童，對於音樂的興趣，正一天天的濃厚起來。我們紙要看到多數兒童，都備有口琴一具，隨時吹奏，而比較大些的，如果他們家裏備有鋼琴，梵華鈴一類樂器的，也會很高興的去習練。不拘電影或無綫電中流行的歌譜，兒實們一哼就會入調，這一切都足證明上海兒童對香樂的興趣日見濃厚呢！</p>
<p>我們相信這些兒童之中，至少有一部分是有音樂天才的。然而光有了音樂天才，如果沒有人予以正確的指導，那結果無非把他們的天才埋沒而巳。像蘇聯，他們對於兒童藝術，一向很注意的，所以兒童劇，兒童影片，和兒童音樂表演等，時常在蘇聯各大都市和人們相見的。因而近十年來蘇聯曾培植了好多天才兒童音樂家。此外英美諸國，對於兒童音樂，也提倡不遺餘力；可是在中國却付缺如。就是上海這都市裏，也沒有推進兒童音樂的塲台，不能不使人感到缺憾！</p>
<p>可是好消息傳來了，最近上海兒童音樂院是正式成立了，地點在愚園路愚園新邨。在上海，乃至全中國，兒童音樂院的出現，的確還是創舉。據說這兒童昔樂院創立的目的在造就有音樂天才的兒童，勿使他們的天才因沒有指導而被埋滅掉。第一屆招收兒童五十名，以五歲以上，十五歲以下的兒童爲限，凡是測騐結果，被認爲有特殊香樂天才者，可以免費的。</p>
<p>上海兒童音樂院自招考以來，已於二十一日舉行入學試騐，大概五十名學額，第一次招考就可足額的。等到開學之後，所授的科目，包括鋼琴，提琴，聲樂，和所有一切音樂上的基本學識。可知這樣的一個兒童音樂院，是相當完備的。我們相信經過一個適當的時期，這兒童音樂院準可造就一批兒實音樂家。這的確是上海愛好音樂的兒童的好消息。</p>
<h3 id="c88">一個算術游戲 <a href="#c88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>小朋友，們們如果有閑暇的時間，不妨約幾個友好或同學來做一個算術游戲，一方面可以增進你們計算的技能，一方面亦不失爲一種有趣的消遺。現在我將道個游戲的方法列舉於後：</p>
<p>祇耍知道某人有多少年齡及該人住處的門牌號數，那麽就能够利用算術的方法，求得一個答數，其末尾的二位必定是某人的年齡，而其他各位即是該人住處的門牌號數。先將某人住處的門牌號數加一倍，再加五，再用力十乘，乘後是加某人的年齡，加後再加三百六十五，再减六百十五就得所欲求的答數。</p>
<p>拿筆者自己來舉個例吧，我住處的門牌號數是八十九，加一倍是一百七十八，再加五是一百八十三，再用五十乘是九一五〇，筆者今年二十歲，加上二十後是九一七〇，再加三百六十五是九五三五，將此數减六一五得八九二〇，二〇是我的年齡，八九即是我住處的門牌號數。</p>
<p>最後須再說幾句，門牌號數的位數可以不論，可是被猜人的年齡超越二位數字的話，那麽這個游戲是不適用的。</p>
<h3 id="c89">關於太陽的話 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>上星期日的日蝕，最吸引人們的注意力，的確，日蝕是幾百年難得的機會，這種機會誰願肯白白地放棄呢。可惜在上星期日的天空中，老是佈滿了雲，允其在下午零時左右，正是日蝕開始的時候，可是天上的雲仍沒有散開，眞使人掃興，直到一時左右才有一些陽光，阿慧便急忙的走到晒台上，伸長了頭頸，張大了眼睛，同時帶了一副爸爸的太陽眼鏡，想瞧瞧這日蝕的奇觀。在一時半的光景，雲層撥開，日光即直射下來，這時他才看見有一黑影印在太陽上，一些也沒有好看。據報紙上說：在日蝕的時候，天空竟黯然失色，差不多像黑夜一般，但在上星期日的天空僅僅暗了一些，他本是乘興而上晒台的，結果是掃興而下來了。</p>
<p>「哥哥，太陽倒底是一樣什麼東西？」他一踏進書室，一眼看見阿明坐在沙發裏，便這樣的問着他。</p>
<p>「太陽是一團在熱得發燒的火球，它能發光和發熱，它對於我們是有最密切的關係，如果沒有了太陽，一切的樹木花草和我們所吃的稻，麥等都不號生長，於是我們吃的東西也沒有了，並且一旦沒有了太陽，便沒有光，沒有熱，便沒有日和夜的區一別，空氣的溫度也沒有高低的變化，永遠是冰冷的，風也沒有，雨也無從降下來，洋海裏的水也都乾掉，地球上將要全部結冰，我們也被冰凍得像一塊機器冰，你想，這樣的情形，可怕不可怕？」</p>
<p>「那麼太陽怎樣會發熱光的？它離開我們多少遠？」</p>
<p>「太陽是一團發燒的火球，於是不論什麼東西一到太陽裏都會燒起來，隨便什麼東西一燒，就有很强烈的光發出來，還有熱度也跟着產生，但是太陽的光和熱，强大得使人可怕了。你瞧，太陽裏的熱度眞高，大的有華氏寒暑表一萬度左右，普通熱到一百度左右，巳是熱得不堪了。太陽竟有一萬度的溫度，眞可使我們吃驚。太陽比地球還耍來得大，假使乘特別快車環繞太陽一周，大的需要十年工夫，它離開地球的距離，大得也可怕，假定火車能够在空中走的話，那從地球直接向太陽開去，日夜不停，須費三百五十年才行，這不是痴人在說痴話嗎？」的確，阿明說得有些痴了，那裏會有這樣的事實。</p>
<p>「哥哥，太陽旣是一團發燒的火球，那麼不是要有燒完的一天麽？」</p>
<p>「不錯，太陽一天的燃燒下去，照理或許有燒盡的一天，不過太陽眞大，可燒的東西也眞多，况且這種燃燒的來源，不會立刻完全斷絕的，要是太陽的燃燒眞有燒盡的時候，那不知在多少萬年之後，這是也不用我們來担心，因爲我們頂多能活一百多歲，你想一萬年之後，我們不知到那裹去了。」阿明說到進裏，竟笑了起來，阿慧也隨着笑起來，原來他已明瞭阿明所說的話，眞有些滑稽。</p>

<p>一天的下午，（本月十七日）王到吳家，正遇吳在聽電話。王在窗外聽得口氣有些蹊蹺，偷偷溜到另一聞屋用挿頭話機偷聽時，正是秋兒和查一少談情訂的的密話。王怒不可遏，向秋兒提出嚴厲質問。秋兒說：「你也配干涉我麽？我早就不愛你了，咱們倆趁早一吹台」，像你這樣窮小子，我不能等着將來陪你討飯。」王和霖却不曾料到她這樣大胆而爽快。然而，他們的婚姻，雖非正式結台過，可也經過訂婚手續，並且有各執一紙的訂婚證書呢。不但此也，他和她在這幾年的肌膚之愛的結果，三年前還由秋兒生下了一個白胖的女娃娃呢！說離就離，那沒有什麽，但這娃娃怎辦呢？</p>
<p>結果婚書焚毀　娃娃歸吳母撫育</p>
<p>吳母究竟老練深沉，她的見解：交際是交際，玩的朋友到底不能作眞的看，因爲：你愛他的財鈔，他愛你的臉兒，要到了他床頭金盡，你紅顏已老的時候呢？可是，秋兒這時　，却聽不進她母親的勸吿了。終於和王和霖互相退還了婚書，並且立即焚燬。吳母却說：秋兒的娃娃，不能退還王家了，我還要留在眼前解悶呢。於是商定，娃娃由吳母負責撫養。</p>

<p>不久，這三幕不同的戲劇，竟在一年之閒，决第地演出了。在一個有星月的夜裹，覺慧剛從學校回來，預備去找嗚鳳談話，走到窗子下，却正聽得鳴鳳和另一婢女婉兒在談着。覺慧待了一會，等婉兒到別地方去了，纔問起嗚鳳。因而知道他肌父的朋友馮樂山，想要納妾，預備在嗚鳳和婉兒當中擇選一個。起初，覺慧還不甚經意，過了幾天，周氏把嗚鳳叫到房裏去，吿訴她已被馮樂山選中，預備第二天送她過去。鳴鳳雖曾意識到這件事，或將不利於自己，但沒有想到會這麼快就發生了。常時雖向周氏苦苦哀求，而周氏却是遵奉着老太爺的意旨這麼做的。雖然覺得史鳴鳳可憐，但是愛莫能助。鳴鳳沒有法子，只好去找覺慧商量。恰遇覺慧囚辦了一個刊物，正忙着寫文章，不但不知道馮樂山要娶鳴鳳爲妾的事，甚至連嗚鳳要想和他說話，也沒有時間顧及。於是，嗚鳳於失望之餘，自傷命薄，只好獨自跑到後花園水池裏自溺以殉。等到第二天馮家來接姨太太，大家纔發覺這件事，然而，老太爺旣已答應了馮樂山，不能使空轎回轉，只好拿另一婢女婉兒代替。恰當這時，覺慧從學校回來，問明一切，纔知道嗚鳳已經死了。大錯旣已鑄成，雖呼天搶地，也沒有法子挽回了。</p>

<p>Chongqing – The war situation in Hunan Province is still critical, with very little news coming from the Chinese side. Meanwhile, Chinese troops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces have simultaneously launched offensives, striving to restrain the Japanese forces. According to Chinese communiqués, battles are still ongoing in Pingjiang and on the north bank of the Miluo River. Chinese troops are currently exerting pressure on the flanks of the Japanese army in that area. However, there is no mention of the situation near Weisha. Japanese troops in Guangzhou are currently attacking northwards along the river, with reports of fighting near Gaohewei (transliteration). Chinese troops in Zhejiang Province are also advancing on Xikou and Shaoxing. Chinese troops in southern Anhui are currently dismantling the railway north of Wanzhi. Chinese troops in Jiangxi Province are attacking near Pengze, Hukou, and Nanchang. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The war situation on the outskirts of Changsha has shown a turning point. The advance of the Japanese central route has been very slow. The western route landed at Lulintan and is operating southwards west of Xiangyin, but reports are scarce. The eastern route appears to be the main force, having advanced beyond Pianzhao and Gaoqiao. However, after the arrival of substantial Chinese reinforcements, a major counteroffensive was launched yesterday, with fierce fighting throughout the day. The Japanese troops have been forced back to the Jinpian area, but this news has not yet been officially reported. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The fierce fighting in northern Hunan continued unabated yesterday. Chinese troops launched a fierce counteroffensive along the Miluo River's southern line of Pingjiang, Jinjing, Wengjiang, Shahe, and Fulinpu, effectively checking the main force of the Japanese army. At the same time, Chinese troops north of the Miluo River, reinforced by a large army, are also launching a full-scale counteroffensive to mop up the Japanese rear. Casualties on both sides along the Miluo River are heavy. The Japanese vanguard that invaded the Miluo area has been completely annihilated. Japanese troops who forcibly landed at Yingtian on the southeastern shore of Dongting Lake and at Xijiangkou west of Lulintan have been repelled. It is reported that the Japanese army, facing strong resistance in its advance and with the Chinese army launching a general offensive in its rear, is deeply concerned about the risk of its retreat being cut off. Currently, Chinese troops have formed a fire net north of Changsha, and Changsha is implementing a scorched earth policy, preparing to fight the Japanese to the death. The Chinese troops defending Changsha number 300,000. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese military dispatches recently stated that Chinese troops are launching countless determined counteroffensives against the front, rear, and flanks of the Japanese army in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui to counter the Japanese offensive in northern Hunan, with the aim of dispersing Japanese forces and preventing them from reinforcing northern Hunan. Chinese war commentators believe that the situation in Changsha is serious but not hopeless. They declare that the situation has improved since the counteroffensive began. They point out that if Chinese troops can cut off the Japanese vanguard, Changsha can be defended. Frontline news from Chinese troops states that the battle in 1939 to drive the Japanese army back around Changsha is now being replayed in northern Hunan. The Japanese army is also relying on the tactics used in its previous attacks on Changsha and is using aircraft to transport supplies to the front lines. Chinese troops have attacked Japanese troops in many areas of eastern China. Chinese troops in northern Jiangxi are attacking Pengze and Hukou and other places near Nanchang on the south bank of the Huayangzi (Yangtze) River. Chinese troops in Zhejiang Province are also attacking various strongholds along the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, such as Yuyao and Shaoxing. Chiang Kai-shek's hometown, Kouye, has been recovered. Chinese troops are also attacking Japanese troops in the Wu-Chao area and the Taihu Lake region. (United Press dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>United Press, Washington, 27th – Fourteen of the 312 American-built emergency liberty cargo ships were launched today. President Roosevelt also delivered a speech, rebuking Americans who spread fear, and said that these cargo ships will sail the seas as they wish. The President reiterated that all forces will be used to protect these ships and said that the construction and sailing of these ships will show the aggressors that American democracy and freedom will never perish. The President guaranteed freedom to the world. The fourteen specially constructed cargo ships were launched simultaneously this morning on both coasts. This is the first and largest group launch since World War I. These ships are specially constructed, difficult to be hit by torpedoes, and can be built very quickly. The President said, "The new shipbuilding program is our response to the aggressors who will strike at our freedom. American democracy or freedom will not perish. The whole world should have freedom, and freedom should last forever. This is what we seek, and this is our guarantee to all mankind."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 27th – From dawn to dusk today, a total of fourteen new cargo ships were launched in shipyards along the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts of the United States. President Roosevelt sent a telegram to congratulate the shipyards, solemnly expressing the government's intention to protect North American merchant ships from being hit by torpedoes, shells, or bombs. Because today is the first launching ceremony of the Maritime Commission's great cargo ship building program, it has been designated as "Liberty Fleet Memorial Day." The design of these cargo ships is uniform, 441 feet 6 inches long, 57 feet wide, and has a displacement of 14,100 tons. They can carry 9,146 tons of general cargo and have a speed of 11 nautical miles per hour. A total of 312 ships have been ordered, of which 112 will be delivered to the United Kingdom under the Lend-Lease Act. According to the current shipbuilding program of the Maritime Commission, it is expected that 1,400 merchant ships will be completed by the end of 1943. President Roosevelt's goal of two ships per day is expected to be achieved by next spring.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 27th – Land, Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission, said last night, regarding the progress of the U.S.'s accelerated construction of merchant ships, that we all know that more merchant ships must be built to transport the necessary supplies to defeat the aggressor countries that threaten the freedom of people around the world. Since the President called on Americans to do their best, American shipbuilders have achieved something that the Maritime Commission can be proud of in this initial effort. Robin Sen of the Naval Department's Shipping Division also said that the launching of American merchant ships should silence those who criticized the United States for neglecting national defense since 1919, resulting in it lagging far behind in international competition, and that it would be useless to try to catch up now. U.S. Military Supply Chief Gregory referred to U.S. overseas bases as outposts of democracy.</p>

<p>After the Nazi army achieved a partial victory in Kiev, it immediately advanced two heavy troops towards Kharkov and the Crimean Peninsula, so that one side could complete the control of the entire Ukraine, and the other side could prepare to invade the oil fields of the Caucasus. At the same time, the German army in the north also stepped up its attack on Leningrad. According to the German side, the capture of the city is imminent. Although the gain or loss of Leningrad or the crisis in Crimea is not enough to become a decisive factor in the German-Soviet war, in order to timely restrain the German military strength and prevent it from continuing to plunder war resources in the Soviet Union, Britain has an absolute necessity to launch a counterattack on all fronts immediately, whether based on aiding the Soviet Union or on self-defense.</p>
<p>Hitler was originally an expert in aggression. During the war against the Soviet Union, he never neglected the necessary arrangements for other aspects. The intensified attacks on American ships during the US-Japan talks have fully proved that although he is fully dealing with the Eastern Front war, he has not forgotten to "cheer" for his Far East allies on the Western Front. These days, with the development of the war in Ukraine, his military position has made significant progress. Of course, he has more energy to take care of other aspects and arrange new actions. According to recent telegrams, his targets of activity are at least three: (1) Inciting Bulgaria to declare war on the Soviet Union, while at the same time pressuring Turkey to allow German troops to pass through, so that one side can join forces with the German forces on the Crimean front to attack the Caucasus, and the other side can further invade Iran to cut off the contact line between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Near East; (2) Sending reinforcements to North African Libya together with Italy, in preparation for launching an offensive towards Egypt again when necessary; (3) Taking advantage of the breathing opportunity after a small victory on the Eastern Front. He turned around and re-oppressed Vichy; in order to realize the long-held dream of "Franco-German military cooperation", in other words, he demanded to use French African ports (especially Dakar) and the remaining French fleet to threaten Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The above three activities, although seemingly unrelated in form, are actually closely linked. For example, if Turkey succumbs, not only will the Black Sea basin be prone to drastic changes, but also the countries in the Near East will be affected. At that time, the German-Italian coalition forces in Libya will naturally take the opportunity to advance eastward, in order to contain the main force of the British Middle East Army preparing to go north to aid the Soviet Union, this is the first; if Vichy also succumbs, and puts Bizerte, Casablanca, and even Dakar into the use of the German army, then the power of the Axis powers in Africa and the Mediterranean will gradually expand, and its threat to Britain and the United States will inevitably increase immediately, and the result will inevitably affect the Soviet Red Army's protracted war, this is the second. Undoubtedly, if Bizerte is used by the German side, the Axis' military transport to North Africa only needs to go directly from Sicily to the port, with only a narrow strip of water in between, which will make Britain's blockade in the Mediterranean ineffective. As for Dakar becoming a German naval and air base, it will further hinder the transport line of the United States supplying the Near East and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Hitler's various arrangements other than the war against the Soviet Union are very vicious. As long as he succeeds in one place, it will be enough to cause extremely unfavorable consequences for the military and diplomacy of the democratic front. Therefore, for the sake of preparedness, the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the United Kingdom, which has allied with the Soviet Union and has the obligation to fight side by side, must strive for the initiative in every possible future battlefield as early as possible and should never let Hitler gain the upper hand again. According to yesterday's news, Britain and the United States have supplied Turkey with aircraft and war equipment, and it is also reported that British General Wavell has formed an expeditionary force in Iran, preparing to assist the Red Army in defending the Caucasus: Although these two statements can give people some comfort and prove to some extent that Britain is preparing to take action, no matter what, it is still too slow and gives people the impression of digging a well when thirsty. In fact, the Soviet Union has been fighting independently for more than three months, no matter how difficult the US supply is, no matter how lacking the British preparation is, it seems that there should be no other action besides some limited supply to directly contain the Nazi war plan and disperse its forces. If we must wait until the Red Army continues to suffer some setbacks, so that the war affects the Near East or other aspects, and then discuss remedial measures, wouldn't we have to repeat the past mistakes of losing the Balkans? Therefore, our first hope is that the three-nation conference to be held in Moscow in the coming days can pay special attention to the determination and implementation of joint combat plans in addition to discussing the issue of material supply. It is even more hoped that the British government can make decisive decisions and swiftly seize the opportunity, and never let the anti-aggression front of the world relive the painful experience of the democratic countries being defeated one by one in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Bank of England Governor Leads Mission to China: Undertakes Major Economic Task, U.S. Representative Hoakland Accompanies <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th – At the request of the central government and the invitation of the Chinese government, Bank of England Governor Niemeyer has now assumed a mission to China concerning finance and economy. Niemeyer recently conferred with U.S. authorities in Washington. Kirkand, a technical assistant to the U.S. Treasury Secretary, will accompany Niemeyer to China. In addition, Baxter, the financial advisor to the Burmese government, will also be traveling with them. It is said that Generalissimo Chiang had previously suggested to the British that the best way for Britain to assist China was to send an economic mission to China. The British government is now taking this action, and the selection of Bank of England Governor Niemeyer as the representative demonstrates the importance it attaches to this matter. Kirkand's accompaniment of Niemeyer can be seen as another clear demonstration of close cooperation between Britain and the United States on the issue of aid to China.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 17th – It was announced here yesterday that the British government, at the invitation of China, is sending Sir Niemeyer to Chongqing to undertake economic and financial tasks. This determined mission is the ninth undertaken by Sir Niemeyer in various countries over the past ten years, including Australia, New Zealand, India, Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Egypt, and Greece.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th – The Times diplomatic correspondent stated that Sir Niemeyer's led British delegation to China is due to a previous proposal by General Chiang Kai-shek that one of the best ways for Britain to assist China would be to send an economic delegation to China. The British side's selection of an official like Niemeyer to undertake this matter shows the British government's commitment to fulfilling its promise to assist China's financial position in every possible way.</p>

<p>United Press, London, 27th – Many prominent figures in Britain yesterday wrote to U.S. Ambassador Winant, expressing their unease about the U.S.-Japan talks. The letter, under the name of the "Aid China Movement Committee," signed by prominent figures such as Welles, Blissley, and Laski, requested that the letter be forwarded to President Roosevelt. The letter stated, "The people are entirely uninformed about the content of President Roosevelt's talks with General Nomura (Japanese Ambassador to Washington), which is bound to give rise to all sorts of rumors that some decisions detrimental to the Chinese people have already been made. Today, all friends of China are aware of your fear in Chongqing. Their unease has not been relieved by the statements that there has been no change in American policy towards China, or even by statements from respected speakers such as Mr. Hull (Secretary of State). Given that Japan has always seen negotiations as an opportunity to propagate aggression and strengthen its forces for further attacks, we believe that a clear statement at this time would be very beneficial and would not create suspicion and conjecture. This statement should state that any agreement with Japan that is detrimental to China has not been considered."</p>
<h3 id="e19">Japanese Emperor Receives Konoe and Toyoda: Ito Broadcast the Night Before, Adhering to Axis Policy <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 27th – The Japanese Emperor received Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Toyoda yesterday.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 10th – Konoe visited Hiranuma today. Domei News Agency claimed it was to discuss important matters.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 27th – Dr. Ito, Director of the Japanese Information Bureau, in a broadcast speech last night commemorating the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact, stated roughly that, no matter how the international situation changes and no matter what difficulties Japan encounters, one fact will never change: Japan's foreign policy will be centered on the spirit of the Tripartite Pact. Any attempts by third countries to sow discord among the allies of the Tripartite Pact will never succeed. In last year's letter from the Japanese Emperor, it was stated that the Tripartite Pact was a tool for resolving disputes and rebuilding peace. Prime Minister Konoe's letter also expressed the same spirit, stating that Japan's foreign policy is based on this. This pact is different from previous military alliances, and its purpose is not to prolong the war to gain benefits, but to reduce the threat of war and establish world peace. If there are countries that oppose Japan's efforts to achieve its goals in East Asia, then Japan's cooperation with Germany and Italy is a natural course of action. Over the past year, Germany and Italy have achieved great results in the new order. Japan's tough stance in the Far East has contributed greatly to the Axis powers, and there have also been successes in the Far East. Japan must use all peaceful methods to comply with the spirit of the pact, such as mediating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and signing a defense treaty between Japan and Vietnam. If there is any obstruction from a third country, Japan must resolutely move forward to achieve a new world order.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 27th – Army Minister Tojo and Army Chief of Staff Sugiyama sent telegrams to Hitler and Mussolini yesterday to congratulate them on the anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Prospects for Japan-U.S. Relations are Bleak: Recent Remarks from Tokyo Cause No Anxiety in Washington <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 27th – Those appeasers and shallow thinkers who have recently predicted that Japan will change its mentality and that Tokyo will develop sincerity in improving relations with the United States, seem to have received their answer from Tokyo yesterday. The remarks made by Ito, Director of the Cabinet Planning Board, Mabuchi, spokesman for the Japanese Army, and Ishii, spokesman for the Information Bureau, were given significant attention by the newspapers yesterday afternoon. According to observers here, judging from these remarks, it is impossible to say that Japan's international position has changed in any way. Well-informed sources in Washington have long expected that Japan has no other choice but to adhere to the Axis powers, because if it were to break away from the Axis powers, Japan's diplomatic position would be weakened, which would be tantamount to admitting diplomatic failure. Now that Tokyo has made these remarks, the hope for a compromise between Japan and the United States, which shallow thinkers had hoped for in recent weeks, has vanished. However, Japan's pursuit of the Axis powers will only lead to diplomatic isolation. If it joins the Axis war, it will be even more isolated militarily. Therefore, Japan is bound to be extremely enthusiastic about colluding with the Axis powers. In summary, Japan's position is seen by people here as neither pleasant nor enviable. Even in the present, it is unlikely that this position will improve in time. Japan's continued fighting in China, and now its large-scale offensive in Hunan Province, is just the right way to quickly exhaust all its raw materials. These raw materials cannot be supplied by the United States, nor can they be obtained from the British Empire. Therefore, the various remarks made by Japanese spokesmen yesterday, reaffirming their intention to adhere to the Axis powers, have caused no anxiety here.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Germany, Italy, and Japan Sign Pact: First Anniversary, Japan Issues Simple Communiqué, Avoids Mentioning Britain and the United States <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 27th – Japan's commemoration of the first anniversary of the Tripartite Pact today was not enthusiastic. The official communiqué issued was simple and lukewarm. Ambassador Hess delivered a long communiqué, calling for Axis unity and specifically stating the unreliability of Britain and the United States. He also explained in detail the reasons for Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union. Few German flags were hung in Tokyo, but many Japanese flags were hung. Japan's official communiqué was very careful to avoid mentioning Britain and the United States. The gist of the communiqué was that Japan hopes to maintain peace and is willing to make further sacrifices to establish a new order in East Asia. Squadrons of army bombers flew over the city, apparently as part of the commemorative ceremonies. Konoe sent congratulatory messages to Hitler and Mussolini, and Foreign Minister Toyoda also sent congratulatory messages to the German and Italian Foreign Ministers. Matsuoka, the former Foreign Minister who was responsible for Japan's adherence to the pact, also addressed the German and Italian Ambassadors here yesterday, reiterating that his confidence in the pact remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 27th – This afternoon, Foreign Minister Toyoda hosted a banquet for the representatives of the Axis powers to celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Alliance. In his address, he stated that the efforts of Germany and Italy in Europe and Japan in East Asia to build a new order are currently encountering many difficulties. Today, it depends on mutual cooperation, trust, and perseverance to implement the mission of the pact. The pact has achieved great success, but there are also many difficulties. Each signatory country should reaffirm its determination to overcome any difficulties that hinder the implementation of the pact's mission. Among those present at the banquet were the German and Italian Ambassadors.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 27th – Schmid, Director of the German Foreign Ministry's Information Department, hosted foreign guests on the first anniversary of the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Alliance. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a welcome speech. Those present included the Italian and Japanese Ambassadors, the Ministers of Hungary, Romania, and other countries, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force attachés.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 27th – Kuo Ping-wen, Vice Minister of Finance of China, stated in a speech at a meeting of the Women's Association yesterday that the Japanese army and air force specialized in destroying Chinese educational institutions during the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, resulting in the destruction of many schools and temporarily hindering China's movement to promote science. However, after four years of war, the quality of Chinese educational institutions has improved. China is currently still an agricultural country, and its natural resources are largely undeveloped. If scientific methods are applied, many times more raw materials can be produced and shared with the world. However, if China is controlled by an aggressor nation and other countries are not allowed to intervene, then this will be impossible.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Hanoi, 26th – An official communiqué recently released stated, "On the night of the 25th of this month, without prior notification, Japanese troops set up barbed wire, conducted searches, and arrested more than a hundred Chinese and Annamese people.

Therefore, a strong protest has been lodged with the Japanese side."</p>
<p>Reuters, Hanoi, 27th – Without notifying the French authorities, Japanese military police suddenly set up obstacles and established security lines on the streets of Hanoi and Haiphong on the night of the 25th and the morning of the 26th, and began searching private homes and hotels, detaining hundreds of Chinese and Vietnamese people, accusing them of participating in political activities in Chongqing. The French side is now lodging a strong protest, considering this action to be a deliberate act of undermining the solemn commitment to respect French sovereignty in the Franco-Japanese agreements.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Testing Army Combat Effectiveness: U.S. Recruits Hold Exercises, Government Will Request Armed Merchant Ships <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, New York, 27th – Whether the combat power of the U.S. Army today is equal to or has increased compared to the expeditionary force sent to France to assist in the First European War is a question of considerable interest. In light of this, the military authorities of Louisiana divided the new recruits into attacking and defending teams to conduct exercises for several days, with the ultimate goal of the defending forces repelling the attacking forces, in order to test their combat effectiveness. As of now, although the full results have not yet been announced, observers generally believe, based on preliminary results, that the equipment of the U.S. Army has improved and that its strength is clearly stronger than during the First European War. General Knoll, who presided over the exercises, stated, "The more training our soldiers receive, the better, because the greatest weakness of the U.S. Army is a lack of training."</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 26th – Political figures here recently stated that the U.S. government does not intend to ask the Senate and House of Representatives to immediately and completely abolish the Neutrality Act, but only intends to ask the two houses to add a clause allowing the government to arm American merchant ships, and hopes that the two houses will not have lengthy discussions, but will be able to quickly reach a satisfactory resolution on the important points. In general, this case will be proposed by Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Even isolationist congressmen admit that they are unable to express opposition to this proposal. Internationalists believe that the current Neutrality Act is fundamentally no longer adapted to the needs of the international situation, but are able to accept transitional measures in principle, pending changes in the international situation that require the government to adopt a strict stance without causing opposition from the isolationists, before taking further action. Based on this, it appears that Senator McKellar's proposal to abolish the Neutrality Act was not agreed upon by the government in advance. It is expected that the two houses will soon express agreement on the government's proposal to arm American merchant ships, but it has already aroused controversy in various quarters. According to reports, U.S. President Wilson, 21 days after ordering the arming of American merchant ships, asked the two houses to declare war on Germany. The famous political commentator Sims published an article in the Howard newspapers today, discussing this matter, believing that this matter is of great importance and that history may well repeat itself.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 27th – Secretary of the Navy Knox recently published an article in a foreign business weekly, stating that the United States is now at the gateway to the Second World War. We must take all necessary measures to protect our commerce and the lives of our merchant sailors from being destroyed by pirate ships. We must move forward on both fronts: detecting enemy pirate ships and escorting our own ships.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Full Text of Soviet Ambassador's Speech at Allied Conference <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Tass, London, 27th – At the Allied Conference on the 24th, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky delivered a speech, the full text of which is as follows: The convening of this conference coincides with the autumn when Hitler's Germany is attacking the Soviet Union with particular force after enslaving and trampling on several European countries. It has now been three months since Nazi Germany treacherously invaded Soviet territory. During this period, the Soviet people and the heroic Navy, Red Army, and Air Force have been fighting the evil enemy continuously, shouldering the most important task of fighting the brutal enemy, because the brutal enemy is threatening the social and political achievements of all freedom-loving nations and endangering the foundations of culture. In this war, which Hitler forced the democratic countries to participate in, the future destiny of Europe and all mankind will be decided.</p>
<p>The Nazi threat to freedom-loving nations, claiming to be the master race, continues to destroy cities and towns, turning prosperous lands into deserts. At the same time, it is willing to sacrifice countless lives in an attempt to rule the world. All of this is intolerable to us. The only task for all countries forced to fight Germany is to ensure that Hitler's Germany suffers a swift and decisive defeat. In order to achieve this task, all countries must go all out. The Allied countries are convening this conference to discuss the implementation of this task. In addition, another task of this conference is to lay the foundation for the organization of international relations and to plan post-war measures to ensure that we are never again poisoned by Nazism, which runs counter to human culture. The Soviet Union is confident that this task can be successfully implemented. At the same time, after Hitlerism is completely defeated, a solid foundation for international cooperation and friendship can be established, in line with the will and ideals of freedom-loving nations. This is the goal of the Soviet people's struggle, and it is also the basis of the Soviet government's activities and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Both in the past and at present, the principle of Soviet foreign policy is to respect the sovereignty and national self-determination of all countries. The Soviet Union's relations with all ethnic groups within the country are also based on this principle. Indeed, this principle is the cornerstone of the Soviet political system. Therefore, the Soviet Union strives to safeguard the independence and territorial integrity of all countries. As for what kind of social order and what kind of government system each country should build in order to achieve economic and cultural prosperity, the Soviet Union believes that all countries have the right to self-determination, and the Soviet Union will strive to safeguard it. Whether in policy or in relations with other countries, the Soviet Union fully follows this principle, resolutely opposes all actions that undermine the sovereignty of other countries, and denounces aggression, aggressors, and attempts to force other countries into war. The Soviet Union firmly advocates collective action against aggressors and believes that collective action against aggression is the only effective way to realize the above principles and establish security and peace for all countries. In addition to striving to safeguard all freedom-loving nations, the Soviet Union is also working hard on disarmament. The Soviet Union will resolutely strike at aggressors. At the same time, Soviet foreign policy remains to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with all countries that respect Soviet sovereignty. In order to follow the above policies, the Soviet government fully agrees with the principles in the declaration of U.S. President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill, and these principles are extremely important in the current international situation.</p>
<p>The Soviet government recently stated that the implementation of these principles will receive the assistance of the Soviet people and the government. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it must solemnly state that the common task of all countries is anti-Hitlerism. This task is to mobilize all the forces of freedom-loving countries and strive to liberate the people who are groaning under the iron heel of the Hitler bandits. The issue of the average distribution of post-war food and all resources is extremely important. The Soviet government believes that the most urgent task at present is to accurately distribute economic resources and war supplies so that the European nations enslaved by Hitler can be liberated as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Soviet Union Offers Practical Suggestions for Organizing Representative Conference <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Tass, London, 27th – At the Allied Conference, it was suggested that practical steps be drafted to supply the European countries with various necessities after the defeat of Hitler's Germany. The draft has six clauses, clarifying the common goals of the Allied countries, namely, to ensure that countries released from Nazi pressure after the war are supplied with food, raw materials, and essential necessities. The draft also stipulates the strategies and methods of activities of the Allied governments to achieve common goals. The sixth item of the draft is about the establishment of a central bureau of the British government, which serves as a mechanism for the Allied countries to discuss various needs together and is responsible for submitting various suggestions to the Allied Representative Conference (chaired by Litz). Regarding the draft, Maisky declared that the Soviet government does not object to and is prepared to accept the first to the first article. As for the sixth, the Soviet Union has no objection to considering the principles, but the most important thing is that the central bureau mentioned in the clause must have an allied organization, including representatives of all governments, with equal status. In order to achieve this goal, the Allied governments should be consulted on issues such as the organization, scope, and working methods of this bureau, so that a decision can be made at the next Allied Conference. Eden said that the Soviet government's proposal could be studied and that there was no reason why the scope of work of the bureau could not be changed or expanded in accordance with the opinions of the Allied governments. Well-informed sources pointed out that, except for the sixth article, which will be discussed due to the Soviet government's proposal, the rest can be considered to have been passed, because the representatives have accepted the first five articles in their speeches.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Red Army Fights Fiercely on Entire Front: Defends Key Soviet Industrial Areas, 118 German Planes Destroyed, German Troops Landing on Hanko Island Annihilated <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 27th – The Soviet Information Bureau issued a war report stating, "On the 26th, our army and the enemy fought along the entire front. Our air force shot down 118 enemy planes, and we also lost 29 planes."</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 27th – Yesterday, according to news from both German and Soviet sources, Soviet troops put up strong resistance along the crucial front to protect the key industrial areas. Fierce fighting continued in the Crimea and Leningrad areas. News from Moscow, Berlin, and London all indicated that there was no change in the front line in Leningrad. The Nazi troops have been blocked 15 to 20 miles from the city. Elderly men and women and schoolchildren in Leningrad are reportedly being mobilized to put out Nazi incendiary bombs. Reports indicate that Soviet troops have repelled the initial German offensive in Crimea, destroying Nazi paratroopers, tanks, mechanized units, infantry, artillery, planes, etc. Several German troops were blown up by landmines in the area. It is heard here that Moscow radio reports that there is heavy rain in all areas of the German-Soviet front. Moscow quoted German sources as saying that 500,000 Soviet troops were captured east of Kiev. Radio reports that fierce fighting continues on the Kiev front, as the German troops are extremely numerous. Moscow claims that the Red Army has defeated German troops near Vorskla, who were trying to cut off the Moscow-Kharkov railway line.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th – Reuters military commentator said, the most notable points of the Soviet front are now focused on Leningrad in the north and the Crimean Peninsula in the south. In the Leningrad area, Soviet troops not only broke the German army's efforts to advance desperately, but also succeeded in counterattacking, making some local progress in several places. Although the progress is not far, considering the fierceness of the German offensive and the intensity of the battle, the progress of the Soviet troops is a great achievement, showing that the morale of the Soviet defenders is high. The battle in the Crimea has been going on for less than 48 hours, and it is impossible to predict the outcome. It is reported that the German side, as previously expected, used paratroopers and air-transported troops to attack the Crimea. The purpose seems to be to occupy the rear Berislav line. However, the Soviet side was prepared early and will have its own countermeasures. The German side claimed to have captured a large number of Soviet prisoners east of Kiev, while admitting that the remaining Soviet troops are still fighting. What the large German troops have captured is actually Soviet civilians, and they are also considered soldiers. However, the German side did not claim that the attack on Kharkov had made continued progress. The fact that the German troops are now trying to attack the Crimea shows that their purpose is in the south and not in the center, because they do not want their right side to be threatened by the Soviet troops in the Crimea. As for the German troops in Murmansk, it seems that they have not achieved special achievements. Unofficial news also reported that the German troops in this area have been frustrated.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Moscow, 27th – According to an announcement by the Soviet Baltic Fleet authorities, all 15,000 German troops who landed on the Hanko Peninsula have been annihilated.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 27th – The Führer's headquarters issued a special communiqué last night stating that the date for the complete annihilation of the enemy troops east of Kiev is not far away. So far, the number of enemy troops captured in the area has reached 574,000 and is still increasing. Our army seized countless weapons, which have not yet been counted.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, German Führer's Headquarters, 27th – This afternoon, the German military report stated that the Battle of Kiev has ended. German troops annihilated five Soviet divisions trapped, and 665,000 Soviet troops were captured, losing 884 tanks and 3,718 artillery pieces. The German army achieved an unprecedented victory. German planes bombed armaments construction near Tula. In the Moscow area, military installations were attacked.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Intense Fighting in the Siege of Leningrad; Red Army's Counterattack Strength Increases <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 27th – In a fierce battle in a certain district at the approaches to Leningrad, the enemy suffered 500 casualties, and our forces destroyed five German cannons, six small cannons, twenty trucks, and numerous other military equipment. In another battle zone of the city, our side captured three Fascist tanks, a small number of artillery pieces, numerous machine guns, automatic rifles, and a wireless communication station. The enemy personnel and equipment were heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 27th – "Red Star" newspaper reports: "The fighting near Leningrad is becoming increasingly fierce. Our troops have not only repelled enemy offensives but also launched counterattacks from time to time, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. On the morning of September 23rd, the German army concentrated a division to launch a new offensive in one of the most important areas of Leningrad. They were met with a fierce counterattack by the Red Army, and intense Soviet artillery fire forced the enemy to retreat. Subsequently, 400 German motorcycles, under the cover of tanks, launched a second determined attack, which also failed. At noon, two German battalions launched a frontal assault, which was also unsuccessful. As a result of three German offensives, approximately 1,000 were killed or wounded. In another key area of Leningrad, the Red Army advanced southward and captured a large village, continuing to advance, crossing the V River and consolidating its positions on the opposite bank. The enemy turned every small village into a fortress, putting up a fierce resistance, but our forces continued to advance. On the 24th, our forces advanced another eight kilometers, recapturing four large villages. Yesterday, the Red Army crushed the German Fifth Infantry Regiment. Our air force is working closely with the infantry in the Leningrad area. In short, the Red Army's counterattack strength in Leningrad has become increasingly strong, and the enemy is gradually feeling unsustainable."</p>
<p>Berlin, Havas, 27th – Authoritative sources stated yesterday that on Thursday, German heavy artillery heavily bombarded ships in the port of Leningrad and enemy artillery positions in Kronstadt, destroying multiple naval and land heavy artillery pieces.</p>
<p>Berlin, Havas, 27th – It was announced here last night that German fighter planes and bomber squadrons sank nine enemy ships in Lake Ladoga on Thursday, six of which belonged to a convoy, and the rest were sunk during a Soviet landing attempt.</p>
<h3 id="e30">New German Offensive Aims to Invade the Caucasus <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>London, United Press, 27th – British military experts say that German mechanized units have launched a new offensive on the southern front, attempting to infiltrate Crimea and use it as a springboard for invading the Caucasus. The German attack on the Perekop Isthmus with hundreds of tanks and mechanized units is considered one of the most intense battles of the German-Soviet war. However, it is reported that this German force has been thwarted by Soviet artillery and is still near the isthmus. It is also reported that several battalions of Nazi troops have been wiped out by landmines around the area, with no survivors. It is reported that the Soviet troops of Marshal Timoshenko, facing the German army in the north, have launched a strong counteroffensive from Kherson, reaching Perekop. Other German forces on the Dnieper River have established some bridgeheads, and it is also reported that the German army is operating with the help of aircraft. These German aircraft, assisting the land forces, are not only attacking Allied forces at Perekop but also heavily bombing the southern region of Crimea. British military experts believe that news of this fierce offensive is sufficient to prove that the Soviet resistance in the isthmus is particularly strong and is obstructing any further advance by the Nazis. Some experts point out that occupying Crimea would be at least as difficult for the Germans as capturing Crete, as the Germans have already admitted that both naval and air forces are constrained. The experts also believe that since the German army recognizes the difficulties in the naval and air aspects (the nearest German air force base is in Bulgaria), they may adopt the method of capturing Crete, such as using a large number of aircraft to transport troops, to conquer Crimea. As for the fierce fighting in Leningrad, the situation is gradually turning optimistic, partly due to Marshal Timoshenko's achievements north of Smolensk, where Soviet forces have driven the Nazis out of the upper Dvina River and recaptured strongholds on both sides of the river. It is also reported that the Soviet counteroffensive in Glukhov, between Shostka and Kyiv, has been quite successful and has threatened the German forces south of Gomel.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – Responsible sources here stated today that bloody battles continue along the entire Soviet front, but no details of the progress of the fighting in various areas have been received. The Soviets still hold at least part of Oesel Island. The offensive in Crimea continues, although there are widespread reports that the Germans have used paratroopers, but this has not yet been confirmed here. This year's rainfall in Ukraine is particularly early, which will have a significant impact on the fighting in the area.</p>
<h3 id="e31">German Forces Near Odessa Suffer 50,000 Casualties in Two Weeks <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Moscow, TASS, 27th – The Romanian 13th and 15th Divisions near Odessa have been reinforced and defeated again near the city. On the 24th, Soviet marines and Red Army troops, under the cover of aircraft and gunboat fire, launched a counteroffensive, resulting in 5,000 to 6,000 Romanian casualties, including 2,000 killed. In addition, our forces captured 33 artillery pieces, 110 machine guns, over 2,000 rifles, and 4,000 shells. Moscow, TASS, 27th – General Petrov wrote an article in "Izvestia" and "Pravda," describing the situation of the fighting in Odessa. The article states: "The enemy's offensive has been halted, and fierce battles are unfolding along the entire front. Although the enemy is numerous, our forces are not only conducting defensive battles but also engaging in repeated counterattacks using fortifications, which have been very successful. The enemy's losses are increasing daily. Initially, the enemy attempted to break through our lines with six to seven divisions, but they have failed. Several enemy divisions have lost as much as three-quarters of their strength, and more than half of their military equipment has been lost. According to extremely accurate statistics, from September 1st to September 15th, German and Romanian forces near Odessa have suffered 50,000 casualties, including killed, wounded, and captured. Recently, the enemy has changed its strategy due to heavy losses, often harassing in small groups, but this is also ineffective. In the past few days, the German and Romanian forces have received reinforcements and have begun to heavily bombard Odessa with artillery and aircraft. Our forces are very familiar with this tactic, so we are never moved by it and stand firm as before. The defenders of Odessa have shown great heroism and perseverance. Marines, Red Army troops, farmers, workers, and Cossack cavalry have all risen up to fight and repelled the Nazi offensive. The situation of the defenders of Odessa is indeed very difficult, but among the defenders, there are no cowards, waverers, or rumor-mongers. The defenders deeply understand the boundless strength of their country, and they also know that the battle of Odessa is of great concern to the whole world. They are determined to fight to the last drop of blood to defend this great city."</p>
<h3 id="e32">Joint British-Soviet Military Review in Iranian Square; London Has Not Yet Confirmed the Joint Defense of the Caucasus <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – London sources say that British and Soviet troops are closely cooperating in Iran, with absolutely no friction. The two armies have established full contact, and the relationship between the soldiers is extremely harmonious, demonstrating the absurdity of German propaganda that the two armies have serious friction. At the same time, Moscow's "Pravda" published an article describing the meeting of British and Soviet troops in Tehran on Tuesday. It is claimed that Soviet and British troops paraded opposite each other in the square, reviewed by representatives of both commanders. After the parade, they had pleasant conversations with each other and then dined together, with Soviet soldiers performing dances for entertainment before dispersing happily. British Staff Officer Brigadier Tilak said that he hoped that the joint British-Soviet action in Iran would be just the beginning of a vast action against Hitlerism. The Soviet troops in the parade included infantry, cavalry, and tank units, while the British troops included mountain infantry, motorized artillery, and cavalry units, all stationed in the suburbs of Tehran.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – Responsible sources here have no confirmed information regarding the rumor from Tehran that Indian British Commander-in-Chief Wavell is currently in Iran to meet with Soviet General Novikov to discuss the joint British-Soviet defense of the Caucasus. However, some form of joint action between Britain and the Soviet Union is clearly within the realm of possibility. The railway built by the former King of Iran uses British-style rails, and with the Persian Gulf now in British hands, it will not be too difficult to maintain a strong British force north of Tabriz.</p>

<p>London, United Press, 27th – On the eve of the Three-Power Conference in Moscow, reliable American sources announced today that the democratic countries are prepared to meet the Soviet Union's needs for tanks, aircraft, and raw materials, and almost completely meet its extensive requirements. Therefore, Britain and the United States have immediately begun to jointly transport hundreds of aircraft and tanks to the Soviet Union each month. The democratic countries have also promised to supply a large amount of raw materials to the Soviet Union's war machine. Valuable items such as lead, which the democratic countries themselves—especially Britain—also lack, will also be supplied to the Soviet Union. It is expected that the United States will also supply the Soviet Union with certain types of steel and ordnance. It is reported that the democratic countries will assure Moscow that they will supply other items such as rubber, tin, cotton, wool, jute, and shellac.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – After General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, recently visited London, Minister of State Lord Lyttelton has now arrived in London from the Middle East to discuss matters with cabinet members. Reuters' diplomatic correspondent said that this is Lyttelton's first visit to Beijing since he took office as Minister of State three months ago. It is widely believed that his trip is related to the transportation of war materiel to the Soviet Union via the Middle East and other matters.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 27th – According to British Sisco's radio message today, Sir Roland Smith, Permanent Secretary of the British Aircraft Production Department, has been appointed as a supplementary member of the British delegation attending the Three-Power Conference in that city.

<p>London, Reuters, 27th – The Soviet Union has officially recognized the Free French National Committee. Yesterday afternoon, Soviet Ambassador Maisky exchanged letters with Free French leader de Gaulle at his embassy. The Soviet Union's letter to the Free French stated: The Soviet Union recognizes de Gaulle as the leader of the Free French and is prepared to handle all matters related to cooperation with the Free French with the French National Defense Committee. The Soviet Union is willing to assist the Free French in continuing to resist the enemy and wishes to take this opportunity to express its determination to restore France's independence and greatness after defeating the common enemy. De Gaulle's reply expressed thanks and stated that the Free French will continue to fight in the Soviet Union and Allied countries until the common enemy is completely defeated. The Free French are willing to do everything in their power to assist the Soviet Union's struggle.</p>

<p>The yarn market continues to advance, but the inflationary trend is still moderate. However, the current situation is very good, due to the continued demand from Nanyang, resulting in the spot supply failing to meet demand. The inflationary trend of mixed-brand yarn is extremely sharp, making people excited. However, the Double-Horse factory's price is relatively peaceful due to the heavy pressure of a large short position. However, ten-count coarse yarn and twenty-count mixed-brand yarn have increased by seventy to eighty yuan in two days. Twenty-count Double-Horse yarn had a high price of 1,804 yuan, a low price of 1,792 yuan, and a closing price of 1,802 yuan. Due to the usual weekend market closure in the afternoon, some said that transactions were still made at 1,802-3 yuan after the closing, followed by further transactions at 1,798-9 yuan. Currently, according to market sources, the yarn market has not been very good, because some of the former bulls are said to be turning bearish again, but the situation is extremely complex, and outsiders find it difficult to understand.</p>
<p>The Double-Horse morning market opened relatively tight, with the first transaction at 1,797 yuan, rising to 98 yuan. Subsequently, profit-takers exited, causing it to fall to 1,792 yuan. At 9:30, the exchange opened higher, and with spot market conditions firm, sentiment remained tight. However, Double-Horse hovered between 1,795-6 yuan for a long time. Afterwards, it was heard that spot supply was quite tight, and buying picked up again, suddenly jumping over the 1,800 yuan mark to 1,804 yuan. However, as soon as the new price appeared, selling also increased, hovering at 02-3 yuan for a long time, then falling back to 1,796 yuan. By closing, some bought in, rising again to close at 1,802 yuan. A total of 11,790 bales were traded today. The amount sold by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 2,000 bales   Nanyang 190 bales</p>
<p>Hong Kong 600 bales  Total: 2,790 bales</p>
<p>The Double-Horse futures market is booming and continues to rise steadily. Its stability is a recent outstanding record. However, in reality, its trend is that people are inevitably wary due to the lack of special prospects abroad. The biggest factor for the firm reliance of buyers is that mixed-brand spot traders are slightly active. Therefore, the factory's orders, after being raised by large players, reach new high prices one after another, and have even broken through the 1,800 yuan mark at closing. Stimulated by this, futures yarn pushed prices up sharply, and short covering also followed. Although trading in the market was not very active, buyers were strong. The October contract opened high at 1,685 yuan, the November contract opened at 1,690 yuan, and then rose to 1,694 yuan. The December contract initially traded at 1,728 yuan, then saw a high of 1,735 yuan. Although there was some fluctuation afterwards, the stability was extremely firm. As a result, the near-term contract closed at 1,683.5 yuan, the November contract at 1,693.5 yuan, and the December contract at 1,732 yuan, each rising by 7 to 8.5 yuan. A table of the market prices is listed below.</p>

<p>Spot cotton trading has suddenly come to a standstill. Because market prices have been rising recently, and inventories have gradually become scarce and expensive, fellow traders are unanimously hoarding and unwilling to sell. Factories have some demand, but due to Saturday, everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a sudden disappearance of transactions.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market fell first due to short-selling by traders from the South and the weakness of Wall Street stocks, and then continued to decline due to the lack of buying interest from professionals. Yesterday's closing price was down 18-19 points from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market plunged due to the liquidation of a large number of long positions and weak spot trading. Yesterday's closing prices were down about ten rupees each. It is also predicted that the opening market today will continue to be bearish by two and a half rupees.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Rice Prices Vary; Speculation Appears to Be Strong <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Recently, foreign rice seems to have entered a period of consolidation, rising and falling, changing daily. Yesterday, the trend turned back up again. At the start of the morning market, new hoarding by large players inside and outside the industry took advantage of the low prices to absorb quickly, and speculative trading by floating holders also became extremely active, throwing against each other, raising prices steadily. At the same time, local shops, seeing the market tightening again, followed suit by adding inventory, and the base appeared to be turning firm. High-grade goods, such as No. 1 Saigon, were scarce on the market, and were exceptionally firm, rising suddenly by about three yuan, opening at 127-8 yuan, and even bulk goods required 125-6 yuan. Medium-grade goods were slightly inferior, increasing by only a little over one yuan, opening at 124 yuan, 123.5 yuan. As for the scarcity and firmness of general mid-range goods, such as No. 2 Siam and Mindon, it was no less than high-grade Saigon. No. 2 Siam opened at 113 yuan, while Mindon was particularly outstanding, with bonded goods opening as high as 122 yuan to 118 yuan. As for the sales of other goods, they were not as smooth as the goods above, nor as welcomed by speculators, and did not receive the same attention for actual sales as did small sacks that are used only for speculative trading. As a result, these goods were grouped together, rising by one or two yuan. Closing prices for the day were 114 yuan and 113.5 yuan for bank and small sacks, 113.8 yuan and 113 yuan for foreign sacks, 115.5 yuan and 115 yuan for No. 2 Saigon, 116.5 yuan for high grade, 122 yuan to 120 yuan for Keo Fot Tip, 124 yuan for Yangon Tip, 87-8 yuan for broken tip high grade, 86 yuan for ordinary grade, and 84 yuan for Jue Zhi. Overall, although all goods rose in unison, the price increases varied greatly, from one or two yuan to three or four yuan, not as uniform as in previous days, indicating that it is difficult to generalize the situation of each good. A total of 50,850 bags of rice entered the warehouse in the past two weeks, with 1,128,235 bags currently in the warehouse, a decrease of 11,321 bags from the previous week, which is not significant. And 50,000-60,000 bags of public warehouse small sacks have not yet arrived, and there is no reason for speculative big players to boost their momentum. However, this situation has occurred, precisely because hoarders have not given up on their intentions, leading to more speculative actions. Volume reached over 30,000 bags, and 500-600 tons from Yinghua Company. However, there was some profit-taking in the afternoon, and market sentiment was slightly suppressed.</p>
<p>Due to the general shift in the focus of buyers to foreign rice, sales of thick and thin japonica rice from state owned vendors were not particularly brisk. Supply and demand were still relatively similar, and the market showed no particular favor. Nanhang early rice still opened at 147 yuan, falling to 144 yuan. With Zhoupu and other east early rice already out of season, Kunshan and other west new rice continued to come to market, with Kunshan new japonica opening at 155 yuan and 154 yuan. Thick broken rice seemed to have fallen out of favor and remained stagnant.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice showed brilliance along with the rising trend of foreign rice. In an environment of scarce goods and noisy demand, Hong Kong special grade opened at 138 yuan, bulk grade at 135-6 yuan, bonded grade at 133 yuan, and glutinous green bean at 111 yuan and 120.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign flour first rose and then fell, and the market showed signs of consolidation. The market opened in the morning carrying on the rising trend from the previous day, causing floating long holders and speculative traders inside and outside the industry to become unusually active. American Kemp and various flours continued to rise, with American flour fort reaching 34.7-8 yuan, and Dongzhan Jinlong reaching 33.3 yuan. Xizhan rose from 32.6 yuan to 32.9 yuan, also up three, five, or six cents from the previous evening, and the market seemed to be thriving. However, as soon as prices rose, profit-takers took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and foreign firms and transshipment traders had already stopped and were waiting to see what happens, so the rise flattened out immediately. In the afternoon, it continued to weaken. As a result, other than Dongzhan Jinlong closing slightly higher than the previous day at 33 yuan, Xizhan was 32.5 yuan and fort was 34.4 yuan, similar to the previous market. Volume was 20,000 bags. Bran hoarders were active, with small bags priced at 33.8 yuan. Wheat was also in short supply and prices were being shouted up.</p>

<p>Yesterday, trading in edible oil futures was unprecedentedly lively. Rice weevils and oil vendors were restless. The former, accustomed to raising prices, aggressively played the long side. The latter, having heard that the first batch of incoming bonded oil had been shipped, rushed to dump, resulting in an evenly matched situation. Prices rose and fell abruptly and were finally suppressed by about two yuan. Total trading volume of Qing oil from the major factories approached 20,000 loads. The opening price for September delivery was 164.75 yuan, with a high of 165 yuan and a closing of 164 yuan. The opening price for October delivery was 167.75 yuan, with a high of 168 yuan, a low of 164.25 yuan, and a closing of 165.25 yuan. The opening price for October delivery was 169 yuan, with a high of 169.5 yuan, a low of 165.5 yuan, and a closing of 166.5 yuan. There were also 4,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from various factories (prices detailed in the market price column). As for raw soybean oil, trading was sparse and prices were flat, with 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil traded at a price of 265 yuan, and 20 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil traded at a price of 187 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Shanghai gold market was the third and final day for the settlement of October contracts. Only less than 500 taels remained. Both long and short parties were not in a hurry to square their positions. Therefore, other than Xiangxingyong transferring 200 taels to Defu, Tianyuan transferred to Qingtaiyong, and Yuxingyong transferred to Xiangxingyong 10 taels each, so the price remained unchanged at 6,888 yuan from the morning opening to the afternoon closing, only squaring by a small one yuan. Cash, however, continued to rise unabated. Although vendors from Tianjin were selling, absorption by vendors from Hong Kong and jewelers made supplies tighter relative to demand. From the morning opening price of 9,250 yuan, counting up ten yuan, Tongkangyong first bought from Xianghe 30 taels, then He Shunyuan bought from Xiangxingyong 10 taels each, for 9,245 yuan, then Hesheng bought 20 taels, and Shunyuan bought from Xianghe 80 taels, Zhongxing 50 taels, Chengji 30 taels, and Hesheng 20 taels, for 9,285 yuan. Later, although Ho Fook tried to sell aggressively, the price still rose. It sold to Mingfeng 10 taels for 9,260 yuan and then sold to Shunyuan 30 taels and Zhongxing 20 taels for 9,270 yuan, then sold to Shunyuan and Mingfeng 50 taels each for 9,275 yuan, then sold to Mingfeng 10 taels for 9,280 yuan. Then Hesheng saw Shunyuan selling 50 taels to Hesheng for 9,275 yuan, Shunyuan bought from Tianyuan 10 taels for 9,280 yuan, and Xiangxingyong also started to buy from Defu 40 taels, rising to 9,290 yuan. Xianghe sold to Shihuo 20 taels and Shunyuan 10 taels, falling to 9,260 yuan, Xianxingyong bought 10 taels from Tianyuan for 9,270 yuan, Mingfeng bought 10 taels from Yongcheng for 9,280 yuan, then bought again from Hesheng 10 taels, rising twice to 9,290 yuan. At noon, it retreated slightly to 9,280 yuan, finally seeing Xiangxingyong buy 10 taels from Defu, closing the midday session at 9,285 yuan, squaring up 55 yuan, with a difference of 50 yuan on the day. Midday trading totaled 700 taels. In the afternoon, the market was closed. The selling price of standard gold from gold shops was 9,350 yuan, with the buying price 200 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Up Another Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelers' ornamental gold rose by ten yuan at 9:30 am, to 950 yuan (buying price reduced by 50 yuan), it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Foreign Exchange Black Market Again Active <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both the Central Bank and HSBC postings remain flat. Small counters such as HSBC also saw the British and American exchange rates remain flat. Because the September allotment of foreign exchange by the Exchange Equalization Fund for legitimate commercial settlement had been exhausted, Huahang and the fourteen British and American banks started processing October applications. Demand from non-essential import trading houses in the black market strengthened again, making it difficult to settle at 4.75 yuan per US dollar, so by noon it had softened to 4.71875 yuan, tightening by 0.031225, with the British gold price still at 2 shillings 8.125 pence. The market was closed on Saturday afternoon, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Hong Kong Dollar Demand Also Strong <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw no changes in British and American gold pounds and British gold notes. Market prices were stable. US dollar notes continued to rise, reaching as high as 22.55 yuan in the evening session. Hong Kong dollar demand suddenly became strong, and market prices rose by one cent. Japanese yen notes also tended to rise, rising to 2.38 yuan in the evening session. Korean notes, however, tended to fall, retreating to 2.06 yuan in the evening session.</p>

The committee will directly pay the accounts of the correspondent banks' customers.</p>

<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds saw selling stop yesterday, with the pressure on the market relatively reduced. However, sales from the "Tong Kang" account were still heavy, creating a relatively weak market. Therefore, the market initially tended to weaken, but later, due to stronger buying interest, it rebounded. As the war in Hunan Province gradually stabilized and people's confidence increased, the bond market may slowly rise. Yesterday was Saturday, with only one session in the morning. "Tong Shun," "Xin Fu," "Run De," "Yi Tai," and "Jiu Cheng" all made purchases, either shorting or going long, making the market quite lively. "Tong Kang," however, continued to sell as always, so Class C bonds once saw a low price of 0.04 yuan. Later, although "Lian He" and "Da Hua" also sold, the market sentiment had strengthened and gradually rebounded. For a time, there were signs of a recovery in market sentiment.

<p>Mill Cloth: The market continued to be strong yesterday, due to good actual sales in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. Holders took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a state of demand exceeding supply. Sales of coarse cloth were flat, with some continuing to rise by 0.025 yuan. Fine cloth twills rose by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan. Bleached and dyed cloth quotations also rose by around 0.05 yuan. Wholesale houses in the street were less interested in buying due to Saturday and high prices. Speculators and dyers continued to take in over 300 pieces. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian buyers were rushing to assemble orders, continuing to process over 400 pieces of various cloths.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Actual sales demand was strong, and market prices rose steadily. Futures prices for various months continued to rise on the exchange, by 0.039 to 0.045 yuan per piece. The spot market for fine cloth and fine twill was even tighter, with machine prices rising by 0.05 to 0.075 yuan per piece.

<h3 id="e52">Flower Flannel Severely Scarce <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Rare Arrivals of Western Goods and Reduced Production of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Flower flannel is a necessary item for making suit linings. The woolen industry initially had fixed sales, but recently, seeing the strong production and sales of domestic goods, the factories expanded direct wholesale transactions. There are specialized dealers in lining materials such as Yuan Chang Xing, Hua Yang, Zhang Xiang Tai, Xin Da Chang, Da Chang De Chang, etc. As a result, other dealers continue to be short of goods. Recently, this type of flower flannel has been severely scarce in the market, with a particularly brisk trend. Spot wholesale prices have continued to rise, because there are only sales of imported goods with no replenishment. Due to rising costs, domestic goods are produced in smaller quantities. Considering the demand from various tailors, the price of Donghuo imported flower flannel is generally 1.5 yuan per yard. Hong Sheng brand is 4 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 3.78 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Sugar Market: Sugar Price Rises Continue Strongly <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>

"Car White" rose by 2 to 1.5 yuan. The guild's clearing prices for spot 24 coarse white sugar were 140.07 yuan and 142 yuan for September imports, and 140 yuan and 141.5 yuan for August, both up 2 yuan. July was 139.2 yuan and 140 yuan, up 1 yuan. June was 138.8 yuan, later rising to 140 yuan, up 2.4 yuan. Dutch red sugar was 126 yuan, 127 yuan, and 127.5 yuan, up 2 yuan.

Hong Kong coarse white was 132 yuan, 135 yuan, up 3.7 yuan, with a larger increase. Futures for 24 coarse white sugar expiring on September 30th were 137.7 yuan, 138.75 yuan, and 139 yuan, up 1.5 yuan. National Day expiry was 139.7 yuan, 140.04 yuan, and 140.35 yuan, up 1 yuan.

<p>Indian bituminous coal: In the previous week, speculators took advantage of high prices to sell, causing prices to fall back into the 600-yuan range. Recently, in view of the scarce arrivals, sales stopped and buying increased, causing prices to rise by over 10 yuan. Yesterday, Pu Dong wharf receipts were traded at 607-608 yuan, with lighterage extra. Retailers in the street were selling screened lump coal at 660 yuan and run-of-mine lump coal at 648 yuan, including cartage.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Hardware: Autumn Rain All Day, Actual Sales Affected <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's incessant autumn rain affected hardware transactions. For example, tinned iron ordered by Tianjin dealers was sold due to the rain. Other manufacturers in the street also had slow transactions, such as Yuan Ding's new lead wire, Hui Si iron, plain white iron, tinned iron, white lead sheet, etc., all of which are hardware items that cannot get wet. Therefore, although some deals were made, it was difficult to deliver the goods. The standards of various goods were not much different from the previous day, such as 200-pound first-grade tinned iron selling for 850 yuan per box, 24-gauge large tinned iron opening at 1,500 yuan per box, 200-pound old steel factory Hui Si iron fetching 740 yuan, and new steel factory goods also needing around 730 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Cork Oak (3) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jianong</p>
<p>Speaking of the wood of the cork oak tree, besides the fact that the bark contains "tannins" that can be used for tanning leather or as dyes, it is only good for burning and has no other use because its wood is very heavy, easily cracks, and rots easily. This inevitably reminds me of a passage from Zhuangzi's "Human World": "The craftsman Shi of Qi went to Quyuan and saw a 'Li She' tree: it was large enough to shelter an ox, measured a hundred spans around... Spectators thronged like a market! The craftsman Shi did not look back and continued on his way. A disciple watched it and ran to the craftsman Shi, saying, 'Since I have followed you with axe and adze, I have never seen such beautiful timber! Why do you not look at it, master, but continue on your way?' He said, 'Enough! Say no more! It is useless timber: if it were used for a boat, it would sink; if it were used for a coffin, it would quickly rot; if it were used for a vessel, it would quickly break; if it were used for a door, it would ooze; if it were used for a pillar, it would be infested with insects. It is timber that is of no use...'" I believe that the "Li" mentioned here is just the "cork oak" because only its wood has these characteristics. The wood of other oaks is all very firm and strong, which is precisely excellent building material. In any case, although the wood of the cork oak is not worth mentioning, its special feature of producing cork is something that no other tree dares to hope for! So, in Zhuangzi's time, it was regarded as "useless timber," but now it has become "good timber," "unique timber," which no other tree can replace! It can also be seen that in this world, there are men of exceptional talent who, although not known or appreciated, will eventually emerge and shine! (The End)</p>

<p>Former British Minister of Information, Duff Cooper, has been ordered to come to the Far East, Singapore, to preside over the war apparatus, in order to strengthen British strength in the Far East. After Cooper arrived in Singapore, he has already met with British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, to gain a clearer understanding of the current situation in China based on Ambassador Kerr's report.</p>
<p>Military Personnel Accompanying the Envoy</p>
<p>The Times reported that according to Japanese sources, Duff Cooper, the former British Minister of Information and current Special Envoy to the Far East, will come to Shanghai with Major General Pigott, the former British Military Attaché in Tokyo, and other military personnel to meet with U.S. officials. It is also reported that Air Marshal Park Aufong, who is currently inspecting airfields in Burma, will soon visit Chongqing.</p>
<p>British Community in Shanghai Eagerly Awaits the Envoy</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" also reported that regarding Duff Cooper's upcoming visit to Shanghai, it had not been officially confirmed as of this morning (the 25th). Alexander, the British Information Counsellor in Shanghai, replied to reporters that he had not yet received official news of this matter. However, it is heard that the British community in Shanghai is eager for Cooper to visit Shanghai because the city also occupies an important position in Far East affairs. It is reported that Kesserow, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is currently Cooper's advisor. If Cooper comes to Shanghai, Kesserow will come along with him.</p>

<p>Speculation in the rice market cannot raise prices because foreign rice is constantly arriving in Shanghai. 58,000 bags of public warehouse rice, shipped directly from Yangon by the Wah Loon Foreign Firm's "Teh Dah" vessel, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and docked at the Long Mao warehouse in Pu Dong for unloading. Jardine Matheson's "Fu Sheng" vessel departed for Tianjin yesterday morning. In addition to loading 3,583 bags of foreign rice and 17,051 bags of flour from Hong Kong to Tianjin, it also loaded 1,590 bags of foreign rice in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of levying cigarette license tax, the Municipal Council originally planned to convene a Finance Committee meeting at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday to make a decision. According to a report by a "Da Zhong She" reporter, cigarette merchants in the International Settlement recently jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Council, requesting that the proposed classification into Class A for those with larger business scope and capital, and Class B for other stores, with annual payments of 30 yuan and 18 yuan respectively, be deemed unfair and in need of improvement. Therefore, after discussion on the 26th, it was decided to re-investigate the business conditions of various cigarette and paper stores before considering the classification method, and to hold another meeting soon to make a final decision.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Foreign Firms Will Have Definite Recommendations on Foreign Exchange Difficulties. There Are Still Some Flaws in the Control Regulations. The Granting of Foreign Exchange Should Be Speedy and Convenient. It Is Proposed That a Stabilisation Fund Committee Member Be Permanently Stationed in Shanghai. <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>After the Stabilisation Fund Management Committee supplies foreign exchange for necessary imports at preferential prices in the Shanghai foreign exchange market, legitimate trade has theoretically obtained legal protection. However, since the implementation measures are not yet fully mature, ordinary merchants can still skillfully obtain foreign exchange from the fourteen friendly nation banks, while legitimate merchants may end up with nothing, making legitimate trade inevitably subject to various obstacles and restrictions.</p>
<p>British and American Merchants Unwavering in Their Support</p>
<p>According to a Continental Press report, major foreign merchants and bankers in Shanghai are currently studying constructive measures to help resolve many of the difficulties caused by the recent foreign exchange control regulations. It is reported that they have held several exploratory meetings over the past week, hoping to adopt some practical plans to solve the difficult foreign exchange problems. As a result of the meetings, no definite news was available yesterday (the 26th). However, it is rumored that at least one country's import and export merchants in Shanghai will take concrete action. According to inquiries made by reporters to various parties yesterday, major British and American merchants with a long-term vision have gradually agreed with the motives and purposes of the foreign exchange control regulations, and feel that it is necessary to take strict control measures in order to achieve the political, diplomatic, and financial goals of the Chinese, American, and British governments.</p>
<p>Practical Application Still Needs to be Improved</p>
<p>On the other hand, most major British and American merchants here are quite concerned about the practical application of the foreign exchange control regulations, believing that there is a chaotic state of foreign exchange in Shanghai. Unless immediate and active steps are taken to remedy this situation, the situation will worsen and become more chaotic. They told reporters that various legitimate import and export businesses in Shanghai have now virtually come to a standstill due to the difficulty in obtaining foreign exchange. Furthermore, the amount of foreign exchange available on the market is very small, causing some important imports to be hoarded, and their prices to soar unreasonably. There are also merchants operating in secret who are making huge profits by taking advantage of the convenience of obtaining foreign exchange at the official exchange rate. If this unhealthy trading situation continues, it will promote speculation, hoarding, and price manipulation even more rampant, and ultimately defeat the purpose of the foreign exchange control regulations.</p>
<p>Control Regulations Still Have Shortcomings</p>
<p>The purpose of the foreign exchange control regulations is to prevent foreign exchange from flowing into the hands of people in countries unfriendly to China, the United States, and Britain, allowing it to be controlled by the Japanese. This kind of control procedure does not necessarily have to kill other countries' foreign trade, as it kills Japan's foreign trade. However, the control regulations currently in place will cause the Sino-British and American trade in Shanghai and the Japanese financial activities to come to a standstill. This situation should be corrected immediately. The shortcomings of the control regulations are as follows: (1) Obtaining foreign exchange from the Stabilisation Fund is always unnecessarily delayed; (2) No distinction is made between the applications of legitimate merchants and hoarders/manipulators; (3) Shanghai merchants and bankers do not know how much foreign exchange the Stabilisation Fund will approve; (4) Merchants operating in secret can apply for foreign exchange simultaneously and separately from the fourteen banks, giving speculators and manipulators opportunities. British and American merchants here, in seeking constructive measures to remedy this situation, feel that at least one foreign member of the Stabilisation Fund Committee should be permanently stationed in Shanghai, so as to maintain close contact with the situation in Shanghai, and merchants in this city can also state their situation to the committee member. British and American merchants also suggested that a central organization should be established in Shanghai to study foreign exchange applications locally. After the initial research is completed, the application, with the written opinion attached, will be submitted to the Hong Kong Stabilisation Fund for final approval and allocation of foreign exchange. This method can eliminate the existing unnecessary delays.</p>
<p>Outstanding Foreign Exchange Should Be Taken Into Account</p>
<p>The business and banking communities also stated that a way should be found to take care of the outstanding foreign exchange owed by merchants in this city. The current control regulations do not have provisions for dealing with this kind of outstanding foreign exchange. According to inquiries made by reporters yesterday, the efforts of British and American merchants in Shanghai to find solutions have now gradually taken concrete form. It is heard that a representative will go to Hong Kong to state the views of merchants in this city to the Stabilisation Fund. At the same time, it is also reported that definite recommendations for resolving the foreign exchange difficulties in this city are currently being drafted and will be submitted to the Hong Kong Stabilisation Fund for reference. After Shanghai trade encountered layer upon layer of restrictions, the first to be hit were British and American merchants, especially American merchants. According to customs reports, the United States accounted for the largest share of Shanghai's import and export trade last month. Therefore, it is only right that American merchants request improvements to the foreign exchange management situation in Shanghai, which can be discussed at length.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Intensifies Control of Materials</p>
<p>The Japanese side stated that it will implement the "Prohibition and Restriction of the Movement of Materials" from the 1st of next month, and the Japanese military announced this morning the "Temporary Rules for the Crackdown on the Movement of Materials in Japanese-Occupied Areas in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River." This measure is clearly intended to intensify control, and absolutely prohibits the movement of various materials related to military supplies, that is, absolutely prohibits them from entering the concession or circulating within the occupied areas. Daily necessities needed by other civilians, such as rice, wheat, and other grains, cotton yarn, cloth, and other clothing items, are also included in the restricted transportation list and must be approved by the Japanese military. The Japanese side also wants to manage silk, tea, and tung oil exports, and will establish new institutions to control them.</p>

<p>In order to compile a cost-of-living index for the Chinese clerical worker class, the Bureau of Social Affairs of the Shanghai Municipal Council is requesting families to record their income and expenditure accounts in detail for three months. It is heard that the number of applicants has exceeded the planned number by more than double, and the deadline was as early as September 5. The income and expenditure account books for October, as well as the accounting instructions, have already been sent to each household by address. Table 1 (population), Table 2 (housing), and Table 3 (unused consumer goods) (referring to essential daily necessities prepared but unused before the start of accounting) in the account book should be filled in detail by each household in the prescribed format on September 30. As for the various income and expenditures during the month of October, they should be recorded in the account book from October 1st. It is best for each person in each household to prepare a small notepad to carry with them to record each item of income and expenditure one by one, and hand it over to the housewife every night to record it in the account book so as not to miss anything.</p>

<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the rumors spread by the Japanese side that some British merchants are about to withdraw from Shanghai were described by responsible parties yesterday (the 26th) as pure fantasy. Regarding Sassoon &amp; Co., which was mentioned in Japanese news, an employee of the firm stated that the claim that Sassoon &amp; Co. intends to move elsewhere is completely untrue.</p>
<p>Without Any Basis</p>
<p>It is said that Sir Victor Sassoon, a Shanghai financier, told reporters in Bombay on August 30 that British businesses have no reason to feel uneasy about the situation here. The Japanese authorities in Shanghai have assured him that Shanghai will not change even if war breaks out, but will continue to be regarded as an international metropolis. When reporters asked an employee of the Shanghai Dockyards Co. about the Japanese side's claim that the company had begun to withdraw, the reply was that this claim was</p>
<p>Extremely Ridiculous</p>
<p>and not worth a response. Reporters recently learned from well-informed sources in the real estate industry here that the widespread rumors that British merchants are eager to sell their properties are also untrue. Responsible parties stated that British merchants have recently purchased a lot of real estate, which the public is not aware of, indicating that from the perspective of British real estate investors, the future is by no means pessimistic.</p>

<p>The three major gasoline companies in Shanghai, Standard Oil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco, have repeatedly planned to restrict gasoline use due to transportation difficulties. Standard Oil has now decided to implement the restrictions tomorrow and announced yesterday: "To Whom It May Concern, starting September 29, our service stations will sell 'Mobilgas' only upon presentation of a 'Gasoline Ration Card.' These ration cards have now been mailed to our valued regular customers. On Saturday (i.e., yesterday), any customer on our registered list who wishes to purchase gasoline from our service stations will be limited to three gallons. On Sunday (i.e., today), all of our service stations will be closed (except for Mobil Oil lubrication services). Starting Monday morning, gasoline will only be sold upon presentation of a ration card. Please take note." Therefore, customers flocked to the company's gas stations yesterday. Oil company personnel stated that since the Hong Kong Equalization Fund provides foreign exchange for gasoline imports, gasoline prices will not change. Considering that the number of oil tankers arriving in Shanghai is gradually decreasing, it is necessary to restrict gasoline rationing.</p>

<p>Over Three Thousand Men Disarmed; Rumored to Be Related to Car Bombing Case</p>
<p>It is said that a major incident occurred in Suzhou on the 24th, and the situation was extremely tense at the time. Consequently, Gong Guoliang and his younger brother Gong Guot were arrested by the Japanese. According to reliable sources yesterday, the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Shanghai-Nanjing railways have recently been repeatedly sabotaged, causing severe damage. The Japanese side secretly dispatched investigators to conduct a covert investigation. Subsequently, multiple individuals were apprehended in Jiaxing city. In addition to the ongoing interrogation, it was also discovered that the incidents of sabotaging the railways on the Beijing-Shanghai line were related to Gong's unit. Therefore, on the 24th, Gong, his brother Guozhen, and over a hundred men from his unit were detained and held at the Japanese Military Police in Suzhou for interrogation. Furthermore, Gong's unit of over three thousand men was entirely disarmed. As a result, the situation that day was severe. The emergency alert in Suzhou was subsequently lifted.</p>

It docked at Pier 3 of the company's Bund location in the French Concession to unload cargo. Around 4 p.m., while unloading, a mishap occurred in the forward hold. Thick smoke billowed out, and the fire raged fiercely. Upon being notified, the ship's owner immediately hoisted distress flags. The Pudong Lujiazui Customs fireboat spotted the signal and dispatched the Pujie fireboat to extinguish the fire. It was extinguished at 5:15 p.m. The chestnuts, vermicelli, carpets, fruits, and other items stored in the forward hold were either destroyed or damaged by water. The losses were significant. It is said that there were several hundred carpets, which were to be transshipped to England. These items were the most valuable and were insured beforehand.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Puyi Handicraft Society Trains Refugees in Production; Develops Specialized Skills for Self-Reliance; Seeks Discarded Clothing and Old Items as Raw Materials <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>After the refugee camps closed, groups of refugees returned to the Nanshi, Zhabei, and other areas, overwhelmed by the changes. They hoped to rebuild their families amidst the rubble. The middle-aged and able-bodied refugees could find some work to maintain a basic standard of living, but the elderly, weak, disabled, orphans, and widows had no means to support themselves and were mostly still displaced and struggling to survive. The Christian Puyi Handicraft Society was established to address this urgent need, with the primary goal of training refugees in production skills. This new, proactive relief effort deserves social reporting.</p>
<p>Puyi Handicraft - Significant Meaning</p>
<p>Recognizing that refugees with no food, lodging, or work were prone to developing laziness, the Society organized "Puyi Refugee Handicraft" with the aim of enhancing the refugees' spirit of self-sufficiency and eliminating the bad habit of permanently relying on relief. Therefore, special emphasis is placed on training in various life skills, providing reasonable wages, clothing, and food to sustain their current lives, and striving to enable them to become independent and self-sufficient, achieve food security, and rebuild perfect families. This type of relief work is known in Europe and America as Goodwill Industries, charitable crafts founded by enthusiastic philanthropists and religious figures specifically to help the elderly, weak, sick, and poor civilians. Mr. Boone adopted this method three years ago and started in Nanshi, working diligently to this day.</p>
<p>Refugee Workshops - Engaging in Production</p>
<p>The Christian Puyi Church at Dadongmen, slightly damaged by artillery fire before the war, is now used as a refugee workshop, housing hundreds of destitute and helpless refugees as workers. They are first given appropriate training. Young girls learn weaving and knitting socks, adult women learn sewing and embroidery, old women learn washing and ironing, and men learn carpentry, painting, and machine work. Even the disabled are required to learn the work they can do. The reporter personally saw several frail old women over seventy years old cutting up rags and sewing them into long strips to be used as mops. Their working hours are five hours, allowing them to return home to take care of necessary personal matters. The food and clothing provided, and the average wage is about 50 or 60 cents per person. Although the amount is small, the Society's goal is not to make them fully fed, so as not to develop a habit of relying on relief. This also allows them to find work outside after learning the skills, and to allow other refugees to enter the Society for training.</p>
<p>Broadly Seeking Waste Materials - Repairing and Remanufacturing</p>
<p>The Society has prepared a "Puyi Bag" and distributes it to donors, soliciting clothing, footwear, furniture, and all kinds of supplies from all sectors of society. Families, businesses, and schools that sympathize and are willing to set up Puyi Bags for regular donations are requested to call "16082" or write to the Society's office at Room 308, No. 115 Hankou Road, and the Society will come to collect the donations at the specified time. These donations are washed, sorted, and distributed to various departments of the refugee workshop for work. By utilizing waste materials, everything can be restored to like-new condition, or made into useful items. Even scraps of silk and broken cloth, the reporter has witnessed several women weaving them into extremely beautiful small carpets.</p>
<p>Refugee Products - Not for Profit</p>
<p>The products of the refugee workshop include newly woven cloth and socks, machine-made noodles, modified clothing and footwear, repaired daily necessities, painted furniture and toys, and carpets and slippers made from waste materials. Every product that is not completely usable will not be sold. The target customers are the refugees themselves. All daily necessities for ordinary people are sold at prices several times lower than the market price. The goods that some refugees do not need are also sold to the outside world at half the market price. The proceeds from the sale of the products are used entirely for the wages of the refugee workers and other relief expenses. The aim is not to make a profit, so the sale of goods is not handled by shops in the market.</p>
<p>Refugee Welfare - Comprehensive Facilities</p>
<p>In addition to handicraft relief, the Society also has various refugee welfare facilities, such as a free clinic for medical care, treating refugees' diseases, providing vaccinations, conducting physical examinations for children, distributing cod liver oil, soy milk, and providing bathing facilities for refugee children. In terms of education, there is a nursery, kindergarten, and a complete primary school. Most of the students are children of refugee workers and poor, homeless children. They are exempted from tuition and miscellaneous fees, and lunch is provided. There are also adult literacy classes, where chicken farmers and the poor can enroll for free to study in the morning and evening when they have free time. The Society distributes rice and wheat donated by the American Red Cross to elderly and weak refugees. If there are elderly patients and destitute women in childbirth, they are given cash. This direct relief is strictly limited and is entirely for the sake of the refugees, as the Society aims to train refugees to help themselves and become self-reliant, and does not want them to obtain food and clothing without effort, as this would lead to laziness.</p>

Recently, they presented a detailed report to the Ministry, outlining the difficult living conditions of primary and secondary school teachers. In addition to requesting additional funding, they also requested an adjustment to the distribution method of this subsidy, that is, to use the actual number of classes opened each semester as the subsidy standard.</p>

<p>— Long Jusheng</p>
<p>May, July, August, September—several months of humiliation—have passed quietly one after another! What is slowly descending is a glorious and bright “Flying October”!</p>
<p>"October," in the history of the New China, is a condensation of the blood of martyrs and is full of vigorous and prosperous vitality.</p>
<p>The thirtieth birthday of the Republic of China—National Day—will come from hardship and arduousness, "October 10th" is such a great festival! I think the children must remember it very clearly.</p>
<p>Jesus, in order to save the world, was nailed to the "cross" by ruthless demons using cruel means. However, although Jesus's body died, Jesus's spirit of universal love and saving the world shines like the sun and moon and is passed down through the ages without extinction. Because there are countless Jesuses who follow the path of the blood-stained cross and move forward to fight for the freedom and love of mankind. Therefore, the song "Jesus is my savior" echoes through , and permeates the universe. Here, the author wants to ask the children, everyone is facing the coming "October", who is the savior of our Chinese nation? Who is our Jesus who saves us from suffering? Please find the answer for yourselves. What must be remembered most is that children must have the "cross" spirit of saving the world and saving people!</p>
<h3 id="e90">The Story of the Eclipse <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlv</p>
<p>The solar eclipse, which is rare in a century, was presented before our eyes last Sunday; although the sky was cloudy and it was impossible to observe clearly, it was still fortunate to see the spectacle of the moon's shadow covering the sun in a moment when the floating clouds dispersed. At that time, did you hear people beating gongs and setting off firecrackers? Did they ever tell you about superstitions such as "wild sun eats domestic sun" or "heavenly dog eats the sun"? But after you have read the "Observation and Experiment of Solar Eclipses" and "What is a Solar Eclipse?" in this journal, will you still believe in any "wild sun" or "heavenly dog"? I know that children who have carefully observed and done hands-on experiments will definitely find its truth.</p>
<p>Here are two more stories about eclipses for you:</p>
<p>Increase a day's wage: In the past, in the Natal region of South Africa, many miners were working in the mine when suddenly the sun hid, and it suddenly turned into a dark world. After a while, the sun came out of the darkness again and shone on the earth as before. In the eyes of ignorant workers, this was of course very strange. So when they received their wages, everyone surrounded the owner and asked for an extra day's wage. They said, "We have worked for two days, because there is a night in between."</p>
<p>Postpone for two weeks: In 654 AD, there was another solar eclipse. Many people in Paris flocked to the church to confess to the pastor to avoid disaster. The pastor sat in a small room and listened to their confessions one by one. Finally, he was sleepless, tired, and hungry to the point of being unbearable, so he came out and shouted to the congregation: "Brothers! Because there are so many people, the astronomers have decided to postpone the eclipse for two weeks."</p>
<p>Children! Did you find the above stories funny? But modern people, when they see a solar eclipse, beat gongs and drums, burn incense, and light candles, are even more stupid; and those words of "wild sun" and "heavenly dog" are not even more absurd?</p>
<h3 id="e91">Children and Music <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>In recent years, the interest of children in Shanghai in music has been growing day by day. We only need to see that most children are equipped with a harmonica, playing it at any time, and the older ones, if their families have musical instruments such as pianos or mandolins, will also be very happy to practice them. No matter whether it's popular songs from movies or radio, children can sing them in tune, all of which proves that Shanghai children's interest in music is growing!</p>
<p>We believe that at least some of these children have musical talent. However, if there is only musical talent and no one to give correct guidance, the result will be nothing more than burying their talent. Like the Soviet Union, they have always paid great attention to children's art, so children's plays, children's films, and children's music performances are often seen by people in major Soviet cities. As a result, the Soviet Union has cultivated many talented child musicians in the past ten years. In addition, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States are also making unremitting efforts to promote children's music; however, this is lacking in China. Even in this city of Shanghai, there is no platform to promote children's music, which cannot but make people feel regretful!</p>
<p>But good news has come. Recently, the Shanghai Children's Conservatory of Music has been officially established, located in Yuyuan New Village, Yuyuan Road. In Shanghai, and even in the whole of China, the emergence of a children's conservatory of music is indeed an initiative. It is said that the purpose of establishing this children's conservatory of music is to cultivate children with musical talent, so that their talent will not be buried due to lack of guidance. The first class will enroll 50 children, limited to children aged 5 to 15. Anyone who is considered to have special musical talent based on the test results can be admitted free of charge.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Children's Conservatory of Music began recruiting, it has held an entrance examination on the 21st. It is estimated that the 50 student places will be fully filled in the first recruitment. After the school starts, the subjects taught will include piano, violin, vocal music, and all basic musical knowledge. It can be seen that such a children's conservatory of music is quite complete. We believe that after an appropriate period of time, this children's conservatory of music will definitely cultivate a group of child musicians. This is indeed good news for children in Shanghai who love music.</p>

<p>Children, if you have free time, you may want to invite a few friends or classmates to play an arithmetic game. On the one hand, you can improve your calculation skills, and on the other hand, it is also an interesting pastime. Now I will list the methods of this game as follows:</p>
<p>As long as you know someone's age and the door number of their residence, you can use arithmetic methods to obtain an answer. The last two digits must be the person's age, and the other digits are the door number of the person's residence. First, double the door number of the person's residence, then add five, then multiply by ten, then add the person's age, then add three hundred and sixty-five, and then subtract six hundred and fifteen to get the desired answer.</p>
<p>Let me take myself as an example. The door number of my residence is eighty-nine. Doubling it is one hundred and seventy-eight, adding five is one hundred and eighty-three, multiplying by fifty is nine thousand one hundred and fifty. I am twenty years old this year, adding twenty is nine thousand one hundred and seventy, adding three hundred and sixty-five is nine thousand five hundred and thirty-five, subtracting six hundred and fifteen from this number gives eight thousand nine hundred and twenty. Twenty is my age, and eighty-nine is the door number of my residence.</p>
<p>Finally, I must add a few words. The number of digits in the door number can be ignored, but if the age of the person being guessed exceeds two digits, then this game is not applicable.</p>

<p>— Jinzhen</p>
<p>Last Sunday's solar eclipse attracted the most attention. Indeed, a solar eclipse is a rare opportunity in several hundred years, and who would be willing to give up such an opportunity in vain? Unfortunately, the sky last Sunday was always covered with clouds, especially around noon, which was the beginning of the solar eclipse, but the clouds in the sky still did not dissipate, which was really disappointing. It wasn't until around one o'clock that there was some sunlight, and Ah Hui hurriedly walked to the balcony, stretched her neck, opened her eyes wide, and brought a pair of her father's sunglasses, wanting to see the spectacle of this solar eclipse. Around one-thirty, the clouds cleared and the sunlight shone directly down. At this time, she saw a black shadow printed on the sun, which was not good-looking at all. According to the newspaper, the sky was dim and almost like night during the solar eclipse, but the sky last Sunday was only a little darker. She went to the balcony with great interest, but came down disappointed.</p>
<p>"Brother, what exactly is the sun?" As soon as he stepped into the study, he saw Ah Ming sitting on the sofa and asked him this.</p>
<p>"The sun is a ball of fire that is so hot it's burning. It can emit light and heat. It has the closest relationship with us. If there is no sun, all the trees, flowers, and plants, and the rice and wheat we eat, will not grow, so we will have nothing to eat. And once there is no sun, there will be no light, no heat, no distinction between day and night, and the temperature of the air will not change, it will always be ice-cold. There will be no wind, and no rain will fall. The water in the oceans will dry up, and the entire Earth will freeze, and we will be frozen like a piece of machine ice. Do you think this situation is scary?"</p>
<p>"Then how does the sun emit heat and light? How far is it from us?"</p>
<p>"The sun is a ball of fire that is burning, so anything that enters the sun will burn. When something burns, it emits a very strong light, and heat is also produced. But the sun's light and heat are so strong that they are frightening. Look, the temperature inside the sun is really high, as high as about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Ordinary heat of about 100 degrees is already unbearably hot. The sun has a temperature of 10,000 degrees, which is really shocking. The sun is even bigger than the Earth. If you take a very fast train around the sun, it would take ten years. The distance between it and the Earth is also terrifying. If a train could travel in the air, it would take 350 years to travel directly from Earth to the sun day and night. Isn't that a fool's talk?" Indeed, Ah Ming was talking a bit foolishly. How could there be such a fact?</p>
<p>"Brother, since the sun is a ball of fire that is burning, then won't there be a day when it burns out?"</p>
<p>"That's right. The sun burns down day by day, and it may burn out one day, but the sun is really big, and there are really many things to burn. Moreover, the source of this burning will not be completely cut off immediately. If the sun's burning really has a time to burn out, I don't know how many thousands of years it will be. We don't need to worry about this, because we can live at most a hundred years. You think, where will we go after ten thousand years?" Ah Ming laughed as he spoke, and Ah Hui laughed along with him, because he already understood what Ah Ming was saying, which was really a bit funny.</p>

<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>The Problem Erupted: Suqiu Proposed a Divorce</p>
<p>Even though "Qiuer" had so many social engagements, she still occasionally perfunctorily entertained Wang Helin. Wang, considering his unlucky status, pretended to be deaf and dumb to Wu's actions. In theory, Wu and Wang could have lived in peace for a while. However, since Wu Suqiu intentionally stopped perfunctorily entertaining Wang, Wang Helin felt a change in the atmosphere, as if the autumn air was bleak with the change of seasons. Wang was a young man in his twenties and was not skilled enough at "endurance," so the problem erupted.</p>
<p>One afternoon (the 17th of this month), Wang went to Wu's house and happened to find Wu on the phone. Wang heard something strange in her tone outside the window and sneaked into another room to eavesdrop using the headphone jack. It turned out that Qiuer was talking sweet nothings and making secret appointments with Cha Yishao. Wang was furious and sternly questioned Qiuer. Qiuer said, "Are you worthy of interfering with me? I stopped loving you a long time ago. Let's break up as soon as possible. I can't wait to beg for food with a poor guy like you in the future." Wang Helin never expected her to be so bold and straightforward. However, although their marriage was not formally established, they had gone through the engagement ceremony and had engagement certificates, each holding one. Not only that, but as a result of their intimate relationship over the past few years, Qiuer gave birth to a chubby baby girl three years ago! Saying divorce means divorce, that's nothing, but what about this baby?</p>
<p>As a Result, the Engagement Certificate Was Burned, and the Baby Was Raised by Wu's Mother</p>
<p>Wu's mother was ultimately experienced and deep. Her view was: Socializing is socializing, and the friends you play with can never be taken seriously, because: You love his money, and he loves your face. What happens when his money runs out and your beauty fades? However, Qiuer could not listen to her mother's advice at this time. Finally, she and Wang Helin returned the engagement certificates to each other and burned them immediately. Wu's mother said: Qiuer's baby cannot be returned to the Wang family. I still want to keep her in front of me to relieve my boredom. So it was agreed that the baby would be raised by Wu's mother.</p>

<p>Hollywood movie star Marjorie Weaver and U.S. Navy officer Lieutenant Commander Xia Xi have been married for four years, but due to career incompatibility, one is in the film industry and the other is in the military and cannot leave, resulting in separation. Marjorie therefore asked for a divorce on the grounds of "intolerable abuse," which has been approved by the court. According to Marjorie, she told reporters: She has lived in Hollywood for the past four years, while Lieutenant Commander Xia Xi has served in the Asian Fleet, stationed in Manila and China. They have only met for sixteen days in the past four years. Lieutenant Commander Xia Xi is currently a U.S. Navy observer, drifting at sea on a British submarine, with an uncertain whereabouts, but enjoying it himself.</p>

<p>— Zhou Yibai</p>
<p>Before long, these three different dramas were staged decisively within a year. On a starry night, Juehui had just returned from school, preparing to talk to Mingfeng. When he walked under the window, he happened to hear Mingfeng talking to another maid, Wan'er. Juehui waited for a while until Wan'er went to another place before asking about Mingfeng. He learned that his grandfather's friend, Feng Leshan, wanted to take a concubine and was preparing to choose one from Mingfeng and Wan'er. At first, Juehui didn't pay much attention. A few days later, Zhou Shi called Mingfeng to her room and told her that she had been selected by Feng Leshan and was preparing to send her over the next day. Although Mingfeng had realized that this matter might be unfavorable to her, she didn't expect it to happen so quickly. She begged Zhou Shi bitterly, but Zhou Shi was doing this according to the old master's wishes. Although she felt sorry for Shi Mingfeng, she could not help. Mingfeng had no choice but to go to Juehui for advice. It happened that Juehui was running a publication and was busy writing articles. Not only did he not know that Feng Leshan was going to take Mingfeng as a concubine, but he didn't even have time to talk to Mingfeng. So, Mingfeng, in disappointment, lamented her misfortune and had no choice but to run to the pond in the back garden and drown herself in martyrdom. It wasn't until the Feng family came to pick up the concubine the next day that everyone discovered this matter. However, the old master had already promised Feng Leshan and could not let the empty sedan return, so he had to replace her with another maid, Wan'er. At this time, Juehui returned from school and, after finding out everything, realized that Mingfeng had died. The mistake had already been made, and there was no way to undo it, even if he cried to the heavens.</p>

<p>(2) Xin Yanqiu</p>
<p>Xin Yanqiu, some people say that she was also a character from Tianqiao at first—like Xue Yanqin—and became famous around the same time as Xue Yanqin. Among the leading female roles (except for those who sing old male roles), she is the most senior. More than ten years ago, Chang Chunheng opened the first stage in Dan Gui, and she was hired as the leading actress. At the same time, Xue Yanqin was hired by the Tianchan Stage, but was ranked third. (The leading actor was Gao Qingkui, and the second actor was Qilin Tong.) Before she had been on stage for a month, Chang Chunheng was suddenly assassinated at the entrance of the theater. A few years ago, when she was performing in Beijing, there was an assassination case in the pool, and she was innocently suspected and suffered a lot of fright. This matter caused a sensation for a while. Later, she was invited by the Shanghai Gengxin Stage, and after only a few days of performing, Yu Yefeng was also assassinated in the box. Xin Yanqiu's appearance is elegant, clear, and beautiful, delicate and graceful. Her eyebrows naturally have a pitiful look, and the shocking and unusual things happened repeatedly when she was performing. Alas, how can a weak person bear this? In terms of her performance, she has an excellent stage presence and imitates Cheng Yanqiu's every frown and smile, fearing that she won't be like her, and she has reached the point of perfection. She is one of the so-called "Four Great Diamond Actresses."</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Angered for Beauty</p>
<p>Xu Jing smiled and said, "Does Brother have the art of judging people by their appearance? Although a person's appearance is somewhat related to their lifelong career, Fan Li in the past ridiculed the King of Yue for having a long neck and a crow's beak, saying that he could share adversity but not prosperity, and it was unfortunately said. Grand Master Wen was actually a successor of Zixu. However, Confucius said, 'Judging people by their appearance, I lost Ziyu.' Tan Jianming's appearance is not worthy of his virtue, and Zhang Liang's appearance is like that of a woman, and the Grand Historian believed that it was a small claim to his ambition. Zhang Liang was able to help Han Gao achieve imperial achievements. Ma Wu had an ugly appearance and was rejected by Wang Mang, but he became a famous general during the Guangwu Restoration. How can appearance really determine a person's life?" Zhang Cangqiu also said that Wu Sangui was brave and promising and was still a hero of the time. Liu Yinying smiled slightly and said, "This is just my rash statement and is of course not credible. Let's see the facts later. Of course, I also hope that General Wu can perform meritorious service for the country, eliminate bandits, and pacify the country and resist foreign enemies, then we can also attach ourselves to him and become more prominent." Chen Fei said, "I only hope that General Wu can transfer troops into the pass as soon as possible. When he meets the bandits, he can fight them heartily. If he can catch Li Chuang, then I will be very happy." Zhang Cangqiu also said, "Second brother is right, I also want to have a bloody battle with the bandits and relax my muscles and bones." After saying that, he drank a cup in one gulp. Everyone raised their glasses and drank heartily. Although Liu Yinying did not like to drink alcohol, he drank several cups tonight, and his cheeks were slightly flushed, as娇美as a woman. Not only did Xu Jing look at him frequently, but Zhang Cangqiu and Chen Fei also stared at Liu Yinying's drunken face in a daze. Everyone drank until the bottles of wine were empty and the dishes were finished before they dispersed and went to bed. (180)</p>
