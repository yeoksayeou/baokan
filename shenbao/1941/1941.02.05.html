<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國國會討論中的「租借法案」</h3>
<p>一九四一年一月十日，是歷史上值得紀念的一天吧！在這一天，美國總統羅斯福，與國會領袖八人，曁政府主管當局五人，及國防委員會主席等，舉行重要會議，討論租借法案；這是具有劃時意義的方案，根據本案，美國將援助中英希等反抗侵略國家，以達到勝利目的。經此巨頭會議之後，即由上議院議員巴克萊，下議院議員麥克康麥克，將本案分別在上下兩院提出討論。直到今天，已經三個多禮拜。當這期間，一面是美國全國朝野集中力量的探討，一面是反抗侵略的各民治國家的呼籲：與此相抗衡的，有德義日三國拚命的威嚇和阻撓。今後全世界形勢究將如何展開，無疑的，這是一大樞紐。</p>
<p>羅斯福在他的爐邊談話裏曾經說過，美國當前一切工作的最基本意義，就是在於把美國化爲各民治國家的「兵工廠」。我們回憶歐戰爆發前，他對德義兩獨裁者，也曾發出過莊嚴的警告。勸他們當時與英法和平解決一切糾紛；否則戰爭爆發了之後，勢必把一個比德義兩國總和力量還要大的國家，也牽進了戰爭的漩渦。這一回的「租借法案」，正是那次警告的後勁，「兵工廠諾言的實踐；而同時，也就把美國推上了實際參戰的邊緣。</p>
<p>綜觀這三個多禮拜來美國各方面的辯論和意見，似乎所爭的第一焦點在乎必要與否的問題。這在擁護這法案的有力人士，例如新任副總統華拉斯說：「萬一德國得勝之後，他對美國第一步當是大規模的經濟戰，這以後，立即就是武力侵略。」又如前任駐法大使布立德說：「除非美國立刻援助中英希等國，美國終有一天耍遭到德國的侵略。」又如前任駐英大使坎納德說：「英國當局覺得美國所予他們的援助，並不能達到所期的程度。」在這類的有力意見之下，「租借法案」已經安然通過了必要與否的第一道關，也即是說明了萬分必要！</p>
<p>第二個討論點，是法理問題。反對派人十的最大理由，是說他達反「中立」，與國際公法的原則牴觸。可是，贊成派力面却立刻給予有力的答覆：美國當前最大的問題，已經是目己及其他民治國家生死存亡的問題了，假如這時還提出國際法原則來的話，那就等於幫助了德義日，此其結果足以促成自己的毀滅。例如國務卿赫爾，海軍部長諾克斯，陸軍部長斯汀生等人，在這一點上都曾作有力的發揮。直到目前爲止，擁護「租借法案」派的理由，已經完全戰勝了孤立派化身的所謂「中立」。</p>
<p>第三個討論焦點，是對總統的權限加以限制問題。在這一問題上，反對派方面大槪可分兩種觀點：一種是以胡佛，杜威等人爲代表的，他們以羅斯福政敵的地位，無條件的反對通過「租借法案」，認爲那樣一來，實際已經把美國變成了獨裁國家，大總統就是獨裁者。另一種反對的却是羅斯福的同黨，他們反對的理由，是基於對羅斯福個人性格的估計，以爲萬一這個法案通過，他將利用所擁權力，把美國牽進戰爭。但贊成者的理由，却有更健全的論據，他們認爲在這樣緊急的國際現狀下，美國現在行動上所最需要的，就是迅速與廣大。爲了達到這個目標，應予大總統以便宜行事的全權。直到目前，後一派已經完全勝利了，不過總結下來的結果，却是在這個大權上，加上兩年的時間的限制；即此兩年，已使羅斯福有足夠運用的餘地，可以應付及措置一切。</p>
<p>第四個焦點是適用對象限制問題。前面三個焦點假定已經毫無問題，即政府派意見獲了勝之後，則所謂適用對象的這一點，當能恰如原案；申言之，即租借法案完全適用於一切反侵略，爲自由而戰的民治國家，如中，英，希等等。可是反對派却多方面地提出異議。最大的一類，是主張這個法案的適用僅以英國爲限。其次的一類，是更進一步主張以「贈款」方式，特別對於英本部，加拿大等自治領，以及英國各屬地爲適用這一法案的對象；換言之，連英國的同盟國也要排除在外。這派最著名的，像民主黨提出來的所謂「代替法案」，「孤立派」領袖瓊遜的提案，以及另一領袖塔虎脫的提案等等。不過最近數天來的世界風雲演變，及德義日三國的反應表現，已經充分證明了贊成派意見的正確，加强了牠的力量，當赫爾於上月十六日發表斥責世界侵略勢力的演說時，他開宗明義先從日本一九三一年侵略中國東三省的事件說起。所以在適用對象上，羅斯福的援助一切民冶國家的原則，實際也完全確立了。</p>
<p>「租借法案」不久就要付諸最後辯論和表決了。牠的通過，現在已成爲定論。據一般估計，牠的贊成優勢，大槪可以達到二與一之比。在不久的將來，我們就可以期待到美國的進一步堅實與勇敢的行動，以逐步實施牠擊潰「新秩序」的程序！</p>

<p>一九三一年九月十八夜日本在東三省沿迄今尚未轉向之長途開始出發時、其領袖獲有一種巧妙、以先果後因動其民衆及世界之聽聞、彼等先製事之影而後造事之實、以此做法、彼等卒如願以償、證明其所採行動之正當、東三省事變發生時、世界猝不及料、尚未知此新伎倆、惟自茲而後、此種伎倆已家喻戶曉、即希特勒亦不辭效法日本、而以弱國威脅爲言、遂藉口自衛吞併弱國矣、創造威嚇的口號之習慣、亦起源於東三省事變、一九三一年曾屢聞東三省三千萬被壓迫人民之說矣、此類數字日本演說家常晚口而出、爲時未幾、世人父屢聞中國數萬萬被壓迫人民之說矣、今日世人復漸聞越南馬來緬甸等若干萬被壓迫人民在白人覊絆下呻吟之說矣、此非絕無意義者也、</p>
<p>松岡言論包藏野心</p>
<p>日外相近在國會之言論、尤充滿口號、松岡指斥義軍失敗之消息、爲惡意的宣傳、其實義軍失利、義國且自承認之矣、松岡對軸心表示親善、對蘇聯表示溫和、對南美表示友好、對越泰與荷印表示威脅、但其言論之眞正意義、則顯爲造成日本被英美包圍之影、其言與德國所發者幾無二致、其實英帝國方與强敵作空前之大奮鬥、而美國正擬爲英帝國之後援、固不能騰出時間與精力以包圍日本也、此乃幾難置信者、惟信德國者將信之、豈包圍之影爲先事而有之影乎、豈此事終成將使日本行動爲不可免之形乎、此固與本文首段所述之伎倆相脗合、然日本竟將採取如此危險而有自殺性之行逕乎、似未可信也、</p>
<p>中日仇隙終難銷滅</p>
<p>一九一四至一九一八年之歐戰、予日本擴充貿易之空前機會、日本爲和約簽宇國之一、（此點德日兩國已故意忽視之）坐收協紙國勝利之果、而德國原有之馬歇爾與加羅林島嶼遂由日本代管、惟此島嶼行政與發展之詳情、則日本久已不願公佈於衆矣、上次大戰中協紙國、赤血黃金不知犧牲多少、以當時日本所犧牲者比較之、則相去何啻霄壤、日本因協紙國流血耗財之結果、得享多年之繁榮和平、惟日本金融之投機趨同、卒使一九二九年之大不景氣打擊日本、較他國爲甚、然當時尚未盛行自己有病轉怪他人之風氣、蓋在一九三一年秋季以前、日本尚採行穩健審愼政策、謀以尋常方式恢復其貿易與財政地位也、不僅此也、日本且亦採行正當政策謀取中國之友誼、此乃日本所可謀取中國市塲大部份之唯一方法、日本以地理鄰近與製造低廉之關係、固可在中國市塲中佔大部份商業也、惟中日仇隙之多年紀錄、尤其是起於一八九五年戰爭與一九一五年二十一條要求者、終不易銷滅、日本從前博得他國尊重之忍耐性、卒爲國內迅速滋長之野心與實利主義所掩蔽、於是陸軍中若干份子遂於一九三一年九月問作由一捷徑以致繁榮之嘗試、從此日本乃行於和平相反之侵略徑、而用武力代替談判以解決爭端、迨東三省旣已陷落、傀儡政權於焉成立、一九三五年初、中國本部或至少華北顯然已成爲日本開拓之第二階石矣、</p>
<p>侵華戰事自陷泥淖</p>
<p>一九三七年所開始之敵對行爲、歷四載而猶未已、中國憶兆人民受其荼毒、中國各口岸與許多大城邑被其佔據、惟四年戰爭迄未使日本償其所欲、且亦未能變史中國人民自爲其命運主人翁之志願、日本民衆初以爲對華戰爭乃短時機而光榮之事、固未料其拖延若是之久、日當局爲說明戰事延長起見、不得不歸罪於他人、雖其所指責者不止一國、但常指英國爲此劇中之罪魁、英國在華權利、較任何他國爲多、「日木之抨擊英國亦固共宜、蓋欲排斥西方諸國在華之勢力、當然以排斥英國爲第一目標也、英國人民之同情旣趨向於中國、而英國亦如他　以若干物質上援助給予中國、惟此種同情與此種有限之援助、胥非造成中國抗戰勇氣之原因、可謂有造成中國抗戰勇氣之功者、厥爲日本耳、日本以其希圖宰制中國之行爲、一使中國奮趨成一大團體具抗戰決心、而振起在此　愛和平的民族中從米前見之戰鬥精神、日本所已促成者、卽其所欲銷滅者、今擬歸罪他人、斯殆無足異已、</p>
<p>不恤作軸心國工具</p>
<p>在華戰爭旣已呈粘着狀態、而歐洲戰事又予日本以可能機會、日本初無活動甘於消極、但在一九四〇年六月杪、德國旣已攻陷波蘭·丹麥·挪威·荷蘭·比利時·盧森堡·與法蘭西之時、日本見侵略有利之明證、乃改組政府而以松岡爲發言人、不久即簽訂三强盟紙、公然自列於對英爲敵之隊伍中、並威嚇美國欲使之不敢干涉歐戰、所可惜者、三强盟紙簽訂後、希特勒對世界尤其是日本而發不日即傾覆英國之諾言、顯無實現之氣象耳英國旣不致傾覆、而美國對於三强盟紙復有出人意表之有力反應、日本確稍形猶豫而世人有時聞此盟約不過具文、有時父聞此盟紙定將實行、亦爲之迷離恍惚、但德國依然活躍密語日本、告以一切進行良好、美國未準備作戰、苟稍示强、即足以嚇倒之、英國暫未傾覆、不過欲使此傾覆更爲有效耳、德國所告日本者、無非爲日本茍有胆量放手爲之、則其所欲得者、悉其在其堂握中、察德國所欲者、欲日本加入戰爭、俾有助於德國、即使日本不勝、亦與德國無關、至多不過三强悉轉强爲弱耳、至於日本可在世界新秩序與德國平分秋色、此誠非希特勒計劃中所有者也、日本地位僅爲工具而非同事也</p>
<p>狂妄冒險國運阽危</p>
<p>德國從松岡言論中可察知其所慫患者確非無效、蓋松岡言論、不過對於泰越荷印之安全、且對於英美之安全含有威脅之意也、假使日本果實行其威脅、則將見有堅決之防禦並見其所用之新式戰具、誠有如松岡所百、但有爲日本今尚未知者、松岡之眞正威脅、非不利於上述諸國之安全、但不利於日本人民之和平繁榮與宰福、日本從事征服於茲十載、未嘗使其人民獲有精神上或物質上之福利、今在華作戰四年、喪亡旣多、損失亦大、而效果全無、日當局至是乃力勸其人民、以爲侵略乃最好之投機、雖以前努力尚未收益、然若再加資本與犧牲、則將來所獲至多、不僅紅利而已也、此種不顧人的價值之行爲、將與希特勒同化、日本領袖似已信希特勒之言而受其催眠、其紊亂之金融與惡劣之政治、或將推其人民人於無可救藥之浩刦中、然此非其所恤也、德國已言之矣、德國所言者必爲眞確、</p>
<p>及早醒悟免淪荒墟</p>
<p>迴想數十年前導成日本偉大之大人物、如伊籐大隈伯西園寺輩、彼等雖有帝國之夢、然不爲虛榮所憑、更不盲目以求不完善之友人、雖在五十年中化封建國而爲新式國家、然不陷其國家於在妄之冒險行爲中、亦不作被人包圍之呼號、彼等所發者爲日本之聲、故能置日本於安固之基石上、惟暫時休止之火山依然存在、近十年中已在爆發中、火燄在噴漸不嚮邇、鎔石流出、摧毀一切、其將遲早達於不可補救之境界乎、他日復臻平息時、雖地面已冷、然埋於其下在、將終成千古之荒壚矣、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　參議員拉佛賴脫昨對參議院外委會聲稱、租借案將以決定美國和戰之權賦予一人、一九三九年三月法前總理達拉第曾告渠、法國希望美國助以財力物力與人力、今此案中已規定財力物力、渠敢言美總統將有理由認此案予以實施參戰全部意義之權、查拉佛賴脫曾任威斯康辛州州長、並於一九三六年組織美國進步黨、同日社會黨領袖多瑪斯亦自參院外委會聲稱、壯案通過後、美軍定將遣往歐洲美國愈有被牽入戰局之危險、，美國欲銷滅德義日之勢力、勢必用兵於歐亞或非洲云、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　共和黨領袖數人、已擬就替代總統援英法案之草案一則、規定給予英國購貨賒款美金一百萬萬元、而英國將所有西半球之領土除加拿大外、均讓交美國、此案發起人爲民內蘇他省共和黨衆議員馬斯、可獲共和黨極大及民主黨中一部之擁護、馬氏告合衆社記者、此案可使英國取得一切需要之援助、但倘使英國戰收、美國即可得保障其國防不致受敵人從近鄰島上而來之咸脅、（四日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米囤戶儘管作祟　所幸昨一日間到米十二萬餘包　囤戶不覺氣餒巿價頓時見疲落</h3>
<p>洋米昨有大量到埠、太古公司太原輪、前日（三日）傍晚抵滬、由香港裝來洋米五千包、昨已起卸完竣、怡和洋行明生輪、應於前日（三日）到埠、但延至咋晨始進口、由香港運來洋米一萬八千四百八十一包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、又怡和洋行裕生滬原定今日到滬、茲悉已提前於昨日傍晚抵埠、停靠羅斯福碼頭、亦有洋米裝來、確數因船到時晚、未能得悉、容今日探明續報、挪商華綸洋行經理之法輪、Gouyerneur　General　A．Varenne號（定名華利）、由西貢直接載洋米三千一百噸來滬、原應於上月二十六到滬、但至月底尚未見抵埠、乃遲至昨晨始進品、裝來洋米三萬二千餘包、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、又法商夏老臣洋行經理之永貞（St．Vincent　dePaul法籍）輪、亦由西貢裝來洋米一萬七千餘包、昨晨抵埠、停靠虹口公和祥碼頭起卸、又華經理之德達輪、亦由西貢直接連來洋米五萬四千八百八十九包、昨晨抵埠、停靠浦東鴻升碼頭起卸、昨日共到十二萬七千三百七十四包之鉅、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨日到定接連、而市面反以人心向上、囤買活潑、期現繼續上展、所幸現貨實銷已减、且評價新盤减低、故行情漲起一元左右、惟上中貨亦已抵達限碼、特高　間有擯持不售、迄中市因價格提足、將齊限綫、無論本鄕店戶等納胃頓見轉懈、漲勢遂遏、且以市貨擁擠、一遇銷遜、市面即難支持、變化立起、冉冉回軟、所以收盤行情較多參差、計若一號西貢初開八十五元、及後仍爲八十三四元、二號八十元至七十七元八角、一號暹邏自八十五元至八十二三元、二號七十八元半、且火絞以市貨最湧、去路不暢、始終僅堪保守原盤、仍爲八十一二元、獨小紋仍以交易旺盛、續增半元光景、碎尖高品以貨稀亦俏、升高近元、開六十七元六十六元半、中關六十二三元、原包回籠、英華司最爲熱鬧、全日成交數不下一千四百噸之多、二月份一號西貢九十四元、二號西貢九十一元、小紋現貨八十九元至八十八元半、一月十六八十八元半、一月十五裝八十七元、二月份建源八十六元半漲至八十七元九角、又達孚二月份自八十六元半漲至八十七元六角、比之前市較大一二元不等、新交易由南僑公司拋出二月份一號西貢五百噸、價九十三元七角、</p>
<p>厚薄梗等國米、零星到頭絡續不斷、而店舖納胃因國米已成貴族品、門莊大都以洋米爲正塲、去路有限、雖洋米繼呈好面、而卒難相與抗衡、售價僅能踞住原盤、與前相仿、若常幫特別原白粳仍爲百零七八元、斛見百零二三元、崑山原白粳百零四五元、斛見一百至九十七元、靑角斛見薄稻九十五六元、原包九十八九元、</p>
<p>糯米市貨雖屬不多、然昨去路轉遜、致使市面亦乏變化、呈無榮無辱之局面、香港特白元猶開七十八九元、中關七十六七元、</p>
<h3>洋粉客銷仍活</h3>
<p>麪粉　昨日粉市續見向榮、查華廠平賣粉仍爲二十三元、由福阜兩廠供給六千包稍零、祇限木街零銷、是以客銷方面、惟有仰給於洋粉、兼傳洋粉運滬愆期聲中、人心莫不望好、統市做開鐘樓花鳥牌澳粉五千餘包、價二十四元丸角、銀行棧貨二十五元、須加一角、藍嘜花牌二十四元六角半、野猪及美麗牌比花鳥鐘樓加起二三角不等、目下香港來源不絕、及米市限價降低一元、故市面脚地、尚難鞏固、</p>
<p>小麥　產地旣枯、滬存寥薄、各廠均待洋麥接濟、對於本麥進胃、亦屬平淡無奇、僅日廠門市、略有收進、價仍在二十三元左右、市塲喊價頻昂、但無正式做開、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆餅作皮球玩　—市况遂紊亂不堪—</h3>
<p>邇來油餅市塲、因油市無機可乘、操縱無法、致一般搶帽子式之投機家、改道易幟、一致　湧在豆餅身上、匾圓形之豆餅、當作皮球玩法、踢來踢去、市况爲之紊亂、一日間漲跌無常、結果仍被抬砌角譜、計開姓記現餅一萬片、價爲十五元、訂三月上交三萬餘片、價自十五元二角半至四角、復爲十五元三角半、肥字現餅十車、價爲十五元三角至四角、利字現餅一千片、價爲十五元、訂二月下交三千片，價爲上五元一角、元隆餅三月上交十餘車、價爲十五元五角半至四角、源記餅八千餘片、價爲二月下十五元、三月上十五元零五分至十五元一角半、五日出口豆于一千三百六十包、運厦門、又九百五十五包運香港、豆餅二千塊運厦門、又七千二百四十塊運香港、生油二千五百十聽運厦門、</p>
<h3>糖巿　刁青升三元　砂糖到九千餘包</h3>

<p>昨日海外絲市、紐約無市、橫濱一致看漲、現貨開一三八五元、較前日續漲一五元、二月份期貨一三九四元、亦漲一四元、七月份期貨一四〇〇元、計漲三元、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、依然淸淡、昨日僅白土絲有所交易、</p>
<h3>金融　華商不斷出外匯　外銀行收進終見軋緊</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、走勢不定、蓋因謠風消散、投機商轉賣、頭寸較爲充裕、但外銀行吃胃依然堅强、尤以後市某美行吸購、對投機商吐出之美滙、有來者不拒之勢、至全日成交美滙、以本月份之五元三一二五與二八一二五之間、爲夥、午刻硬化、會告五元三四三七五、晚收結果、美平英緊〇一五六二五、計美滙五元三一二五、英滙三辦士三二八一二五、</p>
<p>晨巿潛勢鬆弛</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均升〇六二五、紐約銀價仍牛、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌灸對美不動、對滬長一二五、美對英未更、對滬小七分、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士三四三七五、美滙五元三四三七五、較之上日收市、英乎美硬〇三一二五、開後市面鎭靜、投機商先懷買意、向某美行結得本月份美滙五元三一二五、九點半滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅增百分之〇·二五、斯時華商銀行求售、華商投機亦跟吐、計塞予外行本月份美仍五元三一二五、而下月份美滙則做開五元二八一二五、嗣因華商投機家續出美滙頗殷、故潛勢告鬆、計本月份美滙經紀行掮客吃入爲五元三四三七五、午收亦穩、計現貨英金告三辦士三四三七五、美滙五元三四三七五、與晨開價相仿、</p>
<p>美行進意殷切</p>
<p>後市投機商先來買出、本月份美滙、初由某美行吸入價爲五元三一二五、而該行吃胃殊厚、致潛勢軟化、晚收現貨及本月份英金告三辦士三二八一二五、美滙五元三一二五、下月份英金三辦士二九六八七五、美滙五元二八一二五、比融昨收市英滙現貨及本月份縮〇一五六二五、美滙軟則平、</p>

<h3>投機集中棉紗　金巿始覺平靜</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、微波盪漾、價依然出入於六千七百元大關內外、乃外匯穩定，投機家咸集中在現紗市塲操縱力驟見薄弱也、各方人心頗穩、因外匯旋繁即回平、一般匯票商不斷套出、故晨開升至六千七百五十元、旋即步退至六千六百八十元、天元加進、午刻稍回升、下午十餘元起落、二點三刻即收市、爲六千七百元、僅軋小五元、不意收後匯市報軟、故塲外價做升至六千七百三十元、全日交易共三千兩左右、現金初由一利出德孚十兩、照期交高四十元、後寶康進　豐一百三十兩、亦加四十元、午刻忽來復出予德孚二百兩、加五十元、下午德孚又進永豐餘及永豐一百三十兩、加四十五元、飾金關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤祇小五元</p>
<p>晨初續隔昨收市後堅調、再聞外匯開出帶軟、二月份美金五元三一二五難結、檯面買聲熱烈、開盤遂哄達六千七百五十元、但高價難站、原因匯票商立即入市拋塞、成記合盛大豐等供售踴躍、勢被壓入六千七百元關、會降至六百八十元、惟銀號幫斯時維持有方、賤價撈購不少、如天元一利莫不拖進、緩升至六千七百元關外、達六千七百十二元、奈匯市由軟回平、匯票商又掀賣風、良以其中浮空了結買進、略予抵過、所跌甚微、計退入六千七百元關內、告六千六百九十元、午刻市面較寂、散戶檯面需要尚多、定住於六千七百元收盤、午後開出更靜、價仍爲六千七百元、時現金號時和及匯票商新豐稍出、退爲六千六百九十六元、後大及復一般小錢莊微吸、復向上挺、告六千七百〇八元、爲午後高價、俄以銀號祥興獨售、回至六千七百元、即作晚收價、時約二點三刻、比上日軋跌〇五元、收後塲外較好、約做六千七百二三十元、全日七十元上落、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金依然不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、自晨至晚、毫無上落、計大同行仍懸六百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元云、</p>
<p>港票需要仍殷</p>
<p>昨日外幣布况、烚赤市價漲後轉跌、惟於新盤後又趨漲勢、故英美金鎊亦各升五角、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票於午後曾高至十八元六角半、卒爲十八元六角、比上日漲起一角二分、香港票需要仍殷、市價續漲、日金票及朝鮮票漲風未戢、前者高至一元六角二分、後者升爲一元三角、</p>
<h3>紗花　雙馬再見新價　傳廠單續開二千包</h3>
<p>紗市續堅、且漲風尚熾、所以新高峰續而不斷、此因細布價昂、引起新買者活躍、同時實際尚稱不弱、不過客幫買去、皆係三二支細紗占多數、其次二三支亦屬不惡、然投機人們、心思異常興奮也、證券幫某大戶由空翻多、二十支雙馬最高價爲一千五百二十九元、低價爲一千五百〇三元、午後始做一千五百三十元、權跌至一千五百十五元、最後價爲一千五百二十二元、傳說雙馬申新廠方又有開出二千包、是否待證、所以人心稍軟、今日有棉紗五件運厦門、二百五十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後、人心甚佳、續向前進、首盤價爲一千五百〇六元、但買戶接踵而來、市盤處此環境下、逐步上升至一千五百十九元、此時盈利者出籠、同時聞金價回挫、陸續跌至一千五百〇三元、檯面上低價一現、購進做臨時多頭者頗不乏人、時近收盤、籌碼一枯、買風突起、盤盤而上、漲至一千五百二十八元收盤、查半日間成交統計七千七百包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分誌如左、</p>
<p>同行　七、一〇〇　香港　六〇〇</p>
<p>統計　七、七〇〇</p>
<h3>棉巿向榮</h3>
<p>現棉情况趨堅、一般投機互相買賣、隨紗市而起、同時華廠信和·中紡·申新二九廠·新生廠·大同紗廠皆有相當的需要、因之市面向榮、人心振作、但向海外購訂、依然廉宜、抵申一擔、可盈利數十元、所以近來向海外定貨者、異常踴躍云、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因同業購進而漲、續後又因南方幫套賣、及多頭了結而跌、結果較之上日收盤價格、約小一二磅音，</p>
<p>印棉亦因棉商套賣、多頭獲利了結、以及少數投機者不斷售出而跌、昨日連同預測低落三羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、唯一原因、是市塲籌碼缺少、而廠方需貨殷切、故日來交易之活躍、已臻白熱化之境、至於長絲毛貨品之飛漲在俏、更出人意外、昨日高級米特林用以作四十二支原料者、竟達每市擔三百八十五元之高價、然爭購者仍不乏人也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布猛漲　獲利轉賣</h3>
<p>廠布昨市盤旋、人氣稍見鬆懈、蓋連日猛漲、浮多獲利轉賣、惟實需仍見有力、故售盤堅定如故、白貨粗細布·斜紋一部份每疋微漲二角至五角、漂染布亦漲三五角、本月份期貨較現出高每疋五角左右、本街成交坯布·漂染布等近千件、浙路溫甬幫辦色布·府綢·漂布等百餘件、閩奥幫辦府綢·藍布·色斜·粗細布等貨四百餘件、國　星加坡等地辦卡其漂布等貨二千數百疋、五日疋頭運香港三百五十件、運厦鬥三十件、</p>
<p>東布現貨市塲先漲後跌、結果細布仍較前日每疋續升五角至一元、十二磅龍頭細布晨開五十二元四五角、收盤時降至五十一元左右、而後市暗盤又見緊俏、售開五十一元三四角、「取引所」期貨七午收盤俱跌、下午市氣轉昂、但統扯比較各月份回落每疋五角至一元八九角、收盤市價如下、</p>
<p>二月份　五十二元〇一分</p>
<p>三月份　五十三元五角五分</p>
<p>四月份　五十五元〇一分</p>
<p>五月份　五十五元三角</p>
<h3>證劵　公債疲落未止</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况繼續疲軟、仍無振作之象、市塲利空謠言、依然未息、裕興信孚大華等不斷仍有現貨流出、丙種以六十六元開盤後、仍係逐步下沉至五元二角、又跌一元之多、檯面鴻大聯益略有扒空、回上三四角、而潤利易中仁昌等供出籌碼仍多、再回小二三角、生大協康買進抵空、復又回好二三角、市况起伏無常、可見大戶籌碼極爲充裕、默察市情、大戶賣出、每日有相當數量、其不一時賣盡者、恐市價壓迫過小、故前途恐尚未必即能好轉也、結果續小三角至八角、獨九六好二角半、成交約二百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於后、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股一百股、價爲九元正、</p>
<p>倫敦三日（週一）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市均告平滯、行情概無變動、</p>
<h3>海味　各貨紅盤俱漲</h3>
<p>海味各貨、自結賬期間休業以來、最近已循例開市、售開紅盤、較之上年皆有進無退、各幫亦俱有成交、大勢穩定、</p>
<p>（明玉）參頂禿五百八十元、大隻六百元至五白六十元、大中五百元、中禿四百元·三百八十元·三百六十元、小禿三百元至二百八十元、黃皮玉參呂大四百〇六元、一號三百五十元、二號乏貨、三號三百〇六元、四號二百七十六元、中二百二十元、（淡菜）出辦二百四十五元、上大淡二百三十五元、中淡二百二十元至二百十元、小淡二百元至一百九十五元（麒菜）獅毛七十四元、冲獅毛七十元至六十八元、龍芽五十八元至五十七元、武敎六十八元至五十九元、（生粉）飛麒麟標、百〇八元、KG一百〇二元、雙TA七十七元、雙T六十元、（蝦尾）香山四百二十元至三百九十元、田邊尾四百四十元、（西茴香）二百九十八元、（福建香菌）六百元、五百八十元、厚菇七百元、六百五十元（胡椒）黑大椒一百二十五元、一百二十元、白椒二百三十元、二百十五元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　印煤復歸原盤</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、紅盤開做、曾一度虛喊兩百五十元、旋經證實、行盤爲兩百四十五元、照原盤僅加五元、日來終因銷塲有限、散戶趁高塞出、惜無買主、亦屬枉然、故漲後回跌、明市父復原盤、仍爲兩百四十元、尚有暗盤、故烟煤漲風、如曇花一現、有復原狀云、</p>
<h3>藥材　參耳又漲　白燕尚平</h3>
<p>參燕銀耳因來路不暢、屡屢漲價、去年存貨充足者、頗多盈餘、各盈五六十萬不等、今年紅盤開市、又告高漲、惟花旗西洋參漲價爲最、每斤有漲四五十元者、市盤列下、花旗面參正號面參四百四十元、二百面參二百七十元、一號粉光二百八十元、二號粉光二百五十元、三號二百三十元、四號二百二十元、野山頂光一百四十元、種頂光一百二十元、洋參之漲、因美滙港滙及水脚又加二成之關係也、四川銀耳、現雖有到貨、但各行家看漲、故其價亦漲、上檔者二百十元、中一百八十元、下一百二十元、白燕因銷路不暢、未見上漲、上檔者一百十元、中九十元、下八十八元、別直參因售香港、關稅加重、大支較滯、天十五支四百六十元、天二十支三百八十元、以上可起盤碼四十元、天三十支三百四十元、天四十支三百十元、小支可銷蘇浙二路、起盤碼二十元、地十五支二十支三百五十元、可照盤起碼二十五元、地三十支三百二十元、四十支二百九十元、五十支二百六十元、可照盤起碼二十元也、以上爲每斤價、（却酬）</p>

<p>上月二十三日所召集之公共租界納稅西人特別大會、當林雄吉因反對議程第二案工部局建議「討論增徵地稅及市政總捐及特別附加稅」、發表演說、工部局總董凱自威、亦致辭反駁、嗣後正擬對林氏提出之修正案投票表決時、林雄吉竟開槍狙拳凱自威、致多人受傷、大會遂吿流會、領袖領事希爾、乃擇定於今日下午二時三十分、仍在靜安寺路三四五號跑馬廳大看臺原處、重行召集、且已鄭重聲明、今日下午不論晴雨、決不展延、故今日之會議、即為上次大會之延續、最先討論日方之修正案、至日方是否出席問題、日方早有表示、但昨日外人方面、復盛傳有若干日本人將出席之說、惟日文報紙紀載、則表示將以決不出席之手段、以反對工部局加捐案之通過、似並無變更、茲記各項詳情、後於</p>

<p>若干日人仍將與會</p>
<p>據英文大美晚報消息、納稅日人會己正式決議日人不參加今日（五日）之納稅外僑特會、但本市日人昨（四日）晨表示「若干日人仍將與會、」且謂、「納稅日人仍强硬反對工部局所建議捐稅與執照費增加什四、」至於日人將取何種步騾、以阻加捐決議案之通過、則並無表示、</p>

<h3>鑲金其罪</h3>
<p>— 曼卿</p>
<p>有一個時候忽然流行鑲金牙，把光潔的牙磁在電氣上挫過，再套上一個金壳，於是說話時故意多作笑聲，櫻唇初綻，金光燦然，非常得意的樣子。其實說漂亮吧，舊小說中的「編貝」決不是金光萬丈的；說是貴族化吧，那時候的金價也不過一十幾塊錢一兩，這薄薄的金壳，能値幾何？然而因爲「流行」，拉開嘴來，犬齒上都受過「漂亮」的電刑，許多牙醫生也因之發跡。</p>
<p>牙磁受損以後，就受累無窮，牙醫生成了醫藥顧問不必說，凡拉蒙加當也是筆正常支出了。不過時至今日，却也有意外的收穫，就是這片薄薄的金壳至少漲上了三十倍，夜飯米沒有着落的時候，敲下來也好上典當，如果聊以解嘲的話，也是「投機」。</p>
<p>但是話分兩頭，正因爲好上典當，於是在「剝猪玀」，「剝田雞」，「剝耳朶」（槍耳環）之外，也發明了「剝牙齒」——把你的牙齒敲下來，連根拔。這鮮血淋淋的刑罰，恐怕不是當初學「漂亮」時所意料得到的吧？從前「時作笑聲」，現在閉起鳥嘴也來不及了。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，記起一句古訓來了，叫做「財不露白」，今天投機，明天投機，旁邊的人不正虎視着你這些堆高起來的財物嗎？牙齒何罪？鑲金其罪。這堆高的財物連根拔豈不更是一筆好賣買？</p>
<h3>逃難</h3>
<p>— 羅琳</p>
<p>今天這公館裏的一羣，好似蒼蠅沒了頭，大家都現着惶急萬分的神情，在收拾東西，東扯西拖，誠惶誠恐地亂成一團。眞該死！上月剛逃了「難」，今天又要「逃難」啦。</p>
<p>今天一早，張老闆剛要喊阿林開車子出去，忽地來了一封怪信。張老闆拆開一看，嚇得「天官」般的險蛋，變成皮蛋色。—老闆常對人說，自己的面孔像天官——原來「好漢」們又要來「借餉」了。嚇！二十五萬！那還了得！記得不多幾時，也巳「借」給他們過了，如今又來了，眞是不知別人死活的東西！好吧，今天不上寫字間了。拿起電話要打，可是，今天可不知怎的，活見鬼，一連撥錯了三次，只打不通。老闆的朋友，勸他快快避一避風頭，好漢不吃眼前虧，犯不着跟他們拚，是不是？</p>
<p>「阿寳，快上樓去叫太太奶奶們起來，千萬別大聲叫喊。」</p>
<p>「什…什麼？…」</p>
<p>「快去，該死的！」</p>
<p>「是……。」</p>
<p>「這可糟啦，她們女人嚇不起，都是那些殺坯，唉！」</p>
<p>「啊，又是一封信，二十五萬！」太太看見檯上的那封怪信，急得跳了起來。</p>
<p>「別叫，快…快來收拾，收拾，跟我出去避一避再說。」</p>
<p>「到××去？」</p>
<p>「不…，那是我們開的長房間，他們難道不曉得。」</p>
<p>「那麼……」</p>
<p>「別管，快去，快去！」</p>
<p>總算費了九牛二虎之力，像做賊似的，逃進了一家比較淸凈的飯店，大家舒了了口氣。</p>
<p>「媽，等我長大了，去買把大關刀把強盜一齊殺光。」小少爺對武術倒很有研究，別的人都笑了起來。</p>
<h3>寂寞的廣告</h3>
<p>— 帆烟作</p>
<p>「不許亂說，小孩子懂什麼！」老闆連忙把他喝住，眞是，消息給人知道那還了得！</p>
<p>「碰」，老闆把司必靈碰上，自個兒想想，還有些事情要接頭。不錯，逃難儘管逃難，生意還是要緊，况且這幾天漲落多大。他就拿起話筒：</p>
<p>「喂，老王嗎？我在××飯店××號，今天「花旗」啥行情？……十八元半？好，給我脫手……</p>
<p>「雙馬四百廿？不脫手不脫手！……</p>
<p>「今天夜飯末謝謝，間日再來。明天我在不在這裏，還沒有定；好，再會。」</p>
<p>電話打好，老闆又恢復「天官」的笑臉。腮，「逃難不忘發財，」有得財發，就化掉幾個也不要緊！</p>
<p>「阿林，去跟我叫幾個菜，打二酒，千萬不許在外面胡說八道！」</p>
<p>「曉得。」阿林拿了花紙頭就走，但是他心裏想：「湯裏來，水裏去，逃過了這一關還有一關，反正是一樣的。」</p>
<h3>平常事</h3>
<p>— 止軒</p>
<p>這是一個平常的日子。不在古代，也不是傳說，却是現在的事；在人們心上找不出有什麼特殊的感覺，是道樣的一個平常日子。</p>
<p>傍晚，街燈在夜色間正顯出明亮，行人車輛正各自的來去，突然，在一家大餅店裹，有個婦人聲驚叫起來。道時有一個人影踅進對面的弄裏去；隨着店鋪裏有一個漢子從裹面竄出來，一直向弄裏追過去。一會，拖出一個人來，那個人是一頭矗立的長頭髮，一張污黑的臉，身上一件破爛的棉襖，令人一見就知道是什樣的一個人物。滿身顫抖，兢兢的丰中拿着二個咬過的大餅，這物件就使人明白是怎樣的一會事。有人遠逮地望，也有人圍上來觀看；但那個漢子沒有別的舉動，只有大聲的咒駡。</p>
<p>這樣的事，原沒有什麼可驚異的地方。我也曾在一條冷僻的路上，見有一個人，也是一個襤褸的身影，搶了油條而跑，也有人追趕，但沒有捉住。一樣是平常，沒有能令人吃驚的地方。</p>
<p>我也曾見聞過巨大的刦案，這裏搶刦的是一個巨大的數目，調動了許多的警員，到報上也用了大字的標題。這才叫人吃驚，因是那是一個巨大的數目。</p>
<p>但，我却要驚異，驚異那搶大餅油條的人。爲什麼他們的目的是這樣的微小？不顧了法律，有關於一生的名譽和信用。這是巨大的犧牲，他們僅爲了一些大餅油條微小的目的，於是犧牲了一切，這裏却値得深思。</p>
<p>每日，在路上，伸着手，發着哀求的聲音，追踪行人，這些事是難以計算次數的。米店門前，忍受着鞭子，忍受長長時光的等候，却只爲了一些食糧。人羣是像一條長蛇，一直拖過了許多的門面。這裏最顯明，使人覺察有一個無邊巨大的陰影。</p>
<p>假使有人吃驚於巨大的刦案，那末，對於這樣搶大餅油條的事，應該更驚心。因爲這樣平常事的後面，跟着來的事，叫人吃驚的程度，是難以猜想的。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>三　鎭守使的姨太太</p>
<p>這一年，天津省立女子師範的校長侯女士—一個五十二歲的老處女—不幸在無意中鑄下了一件大錯，但由於這大錯所發生的惡果，却並沒有影響她本人，只是斷送了一個她自以爲最得意的女學生；所以即便說它是惡作劇，也並不爲過。</p>
<p>然而不論在事前或事後，侯女士總是口口聲聲的說：「我是好心，我是好心。」道倒不甚假話！她老人家的確是好心，所不幸的是她沒有知道好心有時候也可以害人，也可以殺人！</p>
<p>事情的開始，只是一次很平淡的紀念會。</p>
<p>省立女子師範因爲是省立」的緣故，多少也不免有些衙門色彩，每逢舉行開學禮，畢業禮，以及一切紀念會的日子，當地的幾位最高長官，例如省長老爺和督軍大人之類，總得被邀請到學堂裏來，像神道似的抬進大禮堂去，好歹供上一兩個鐘頭，無非也是要借他們的威靈，勉強把各種儀式，裝點得格外嚴肅一些而已。</p>
<p>這次是學校成立的五週紀念，向來不注重趣味化的侯校長，堅決拒絕了其他幾位敎師的建議，始終不答應在紀念儀式之後，再加任何遊藝節目。她覺得辦學堂的目的只是在敎學生唸書，那些類似雜耍式的舞蹈歌唱等等，根本就是多餘的：假使再讓她們公然在許多人面前表演，那就不但出了她們自己的醜，簡直連她—侯校長的臉，也給她們丟盡了。所以這一次的五周紀念會，照例還是「振鈴開會，向國旗行三鞠躬禮，校長報告，長官致訓詞…」等等一串單調秩序，其中比較有些趣味的，就祇唱國歌校歌和學生致謝詞的三個節目：學生致謝詞的一節本來是沒有的，其後因爲這次的紀念會恰巧已在暑假之前舉行，所以同時又利用它作爲第四屆學生的畢業典禮，順便請在省長給憑，而由學生中推一個代表致詞答謝。（二二）</p>

<h3>鄧波兒夫人談　秀蘭鄧波兒的前途</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒自去年正式退出福斯公司，踏進西湖女校以後，關於她的學校生活，筆者巳經在本欄報道過，可是她底前途怎樣，想來也是一般影迷所關心的。鄧波兒夫人—秀蘭的媽，對於她女兒的將來，有着不同的計劃，她坦白地告訴我們說：</p>
<p>「秀蘭並未厭倦影坛，但我們倒覺得累了，我們要她退出一兩年，以資休息。當我在燈光下，給她解釋喬治（秀蘭的爸）和我計劃將退休兩年的時候，她把眼睛張得和鶚一樣，沈默許久，才低聲說：「我希望不久再去拍片。」我知道她不工作，將不愉快，拍片在她看得和生命一般重要。她是這樣地誠墾，不過這是我所要聲明的，我必須利用更好的機會使她的事業燦爛起來。</p>
<p>「關於她底前途，現在已決定的計劃，有如卜兩種：第一因為秀蘭仍眷念影壇，她每年要拍一部片子，或至多兩年間拍三部片子，可是秀蘭須有最好的劇本，目前適合者殊少，所以我們不願訂長期合同，而贊成訂部頭戲合同。第二由於秀蘭去年聖誕節，與納爾遜埃第唱Silent　Night一曲感到無窮之愉快，所以明年春季，她也許會出現於電台，不過新金尚求討論妥定，而所播的節目亦未排定，或者是播一點兒童劇，她可照原來的姿態播唱。總之，我們仍以她的學業為重，拍片播音，都在其次。</p>
<p>「此外，好萊塢幾家影片公司大都要拉攏秀蘭，但我們一槪予以拒絕，並未訂任伺合同。至於有人說她將進環球公司，那也不足置信，她不過要踐製片家潘斯德聶克之約，將與狄安娜竇萍和葛璐麗琪安合拍一片罷了。」</p>
<p>最後，鄧波兒夫人鄭重地說：「即是秀蘭將來重返銀幕，我要她演眞實的，有表演技術的現代化的故事，再沒有如以前那種兒童趣劇了。」</p>

<h3>藝壇散記</h3>
<p>— 守蕪</p>
<p>民華公司為拍「古中國之歌」，在攝影棚裏搭了一個極為考究的台，因之引得若干戲迷食指大動，頗想在這上面一顯身手，建議之下，居然一致通過，於是這台戲是唱定了。不過日期方面，則元宵節恐怕趕不及，第一，「古中國之歌」在元宵節前一定不能拍完，要是中間插入這樣一場同樂會，費時失業，那損失不免太浩大；第二，參加這次同樂會節目的，儘有好幾個是「羊毛」，「羊毛」固不怕人笑，但是要人家笑而看得下去，那還是需要若干日的「苦功」也。所以，看模樣，這台彩排，實現之期當在「古中國之歌」攝影場工作結束之後。</p>
<p>若干電影從業員在寗波同鄕會演「雷雨」生意好極好極，所以再接再厲，於今日起再演「春到人間」。預料不久之後，此類公演，將如「雨後春筍」。</p>
<p>途遇吳承達沈琪兩君，談起民華的同樂會節目，吳沈兩君自吿奮勇，云亦將參加一個節目，請孫景璐梅霞兩女士來合演「雙五花洞」，不過事機尚未成熟，此一「理想劇目」尚待孫梅兩女士答應後才能公佈云</p>
<p>吳永剛編導王熙春舒適等主演之「紅粉金戈」，現已由裴冲在着手改編改良平劇中，一俟劇本脱稿，或將由新藝劇社平劇組演出之，或交張翼鵬等演出之，亦未可知。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Government Agrees to Gauss's Appointment to China; Gauss Has Extensive Contacts and Sympathizes with China's Resistance; Johnson's Appointment as Australian Minister is a Self-Requested Transfer</h3>
<p>Chongqing - It was officially confirmed today that the US government's appointment of Gauss, the first minister to Australia, as ambassador to China, replacing Johnson at his request, has been approved by the Chinese government. Meanwhile, Chinese newspapers here also began publishing news of this matter today, stating that Gauss will soon leave Australia for Chongqing. The Chinese newspapers also stated that Gauss has extensive contacts in China and sympathizes with China's resistance. Officials at the US Embassy here said they have received news from the State Department in Washington regarding the transfer of Johnson, but before Washington officially announces the appointment of Gauss as ambassador to China, they are unwilling to comment on the matter, adding that Ambassador Johnson has not yet considered leaving Chongqing or his future plans. By October, Ambassador Johnson will have completed twenty-five years of diplomatic service in China. From 1929 to 1930, he served as minister to China, and in 1935, he was promoted to the first US ambassador to China. Sources in Washington said that Ambassador Johnson will likely switch positions with Gauss, but it is said that Johnson has served in the diplomatic service for thirty-three years and may retire. Observers in Washington believe that the United States consulted China and Australia regarding the Johnson and Gauss matter, following normal diplomatic procedures. Such a position swap is rare in history, as Johnson will be taking a lower position with a salary reduced from US$17,000 to US$10,000. The current US ambassador to China, Philips, also moved from ambassador to Belgium to minister to Canada, but that was when the United States began establishing diplomatic relations with an important neighbor. In 1937, Gudah from Poland was transferred to the legation in Ireland. Before being appointed minister to Australia last year, Gauss served as consul-general in Shanghai and is one of the most senior members of the diplomatic service. Gauss began serving as vice-consul in Shanghai in 1907 and served continuously in China for four terms, holding positions such as counselor at the embassy in Peiping, representative, and counselor and consul-general at the embassy in Shanghai. He also served in the State Department for a year and as counselor and consul-general at the embassy in Paris. On January 8, 1940, President Roosevelt nominated Gauss as minister to Australia, which was soon approved by the Senate. Gauss's appointment came after the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the United States and Australia. Johnson first came to China in 1907 as a trainee interpreter and is one of the most widely traveled members of the diplomatic community in China. Apart from serving as head of the Far Eastern Affairs Section of the State Department from 1918 to 1921 and as Assistant Secretary of State from 1927 to 1929, Johnson has remained in China since 1907, serving in consulates in Shenyang, Harbin, Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, and Shanghai. (United Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Although no official news has been received from Washington regarding the rumored transfer of US Ambassador to China Johnson to Australia, Reuters learned from US sources here that Johnson requested the transfer because his wife and children could not live with him in Chongqing as a result of the State Department's order to evacuate American women and children from the Far East. It is said that Washington suggested sending Johnson as ambassador to South Africa or Australia, and he reportedly preferred the Australian position. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Multiple Japanese Aircraft Attack Hechuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Eighteen Japanese aircraft raided Hechuan, north of Chongqing, this afternoon. An air raid alert was issued here at 11:30 am and lifted at 2:30 pm. No Japanese aircraft were sighted near Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Shangrao - Four Japanese aircraft raided Shangrao on the morning of the 4th, dropping multiple bombs in the southern suburbs. (Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Land in Dapeng Bay, Attempting to Cut Off Traffic Between Hong Kong and Shaoguan; Danshui Repeatedly Bombed by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - According to reliable sources here today, Japanese troops landed at several locations in Taipeng Bay this morning and are advancing along the Hong Kong-Shaoguan highway towards Danshui. Danshui was heavily bombed yesterday and this morning. The defending forces in Danshui are very thin, and its fall is imminent. Military observers said that the purpose of this move by the Japanese army is to cut off traffic between Daya Bay and Shaoguan. (International News Service dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Nichinichi Shimbun's Guangzhou dispatch stated that Japanese troops, under the cover of warships, suddenly landed southeast of Huizhou in eastern Guangdong this morning. The purpose of this landing is to cut off the route from Hong Kong to Shaoguan, as it is said that this route is the most important supply route for China. Chongqing relies heavily on this route because the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is closed, and the Yunnan-Burma Road is also very difficult. Meanwhile, another Guangzhou dispatch from the Japanese side stated that Japanese forces have stepped up the blockade of waterways in southern China. The Chinese side secretly transported a large quantity of military supplies from Hong Kong to Huizhou via Shayuchong. (United Press dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Guangzhou - A Japanese military spokesman announced today that Japanese land forces in South China, together with the navy, landed at a certain location in Mills Bay (transliteration), southeast of Huizhou, at 5:30 this morning, in an attempt to cut off the highway from Hong Kong to Shaoguan. He also said that since the beginning of the year, Japanese forces have destroyed 65 Chinese trucks, 182 civilian boats, 500 packages of goods, 20,000 cans of gasoline, 15 warehouses, and several railway stations. According to Japanese sources, the Chinese army is not expected to put up significant resistance when Japanese troops cut off the highway. Goods from Hong Kong are currently transported to Shaoguan via the highway, where the headquarters of General Yu Hanmou, deputy commander of the Fourth War Zone, is also located. After Japanese troops stationed in Vietnam bombed the Yunnan-Burma Road from Tokyo and Japan from time to time, China's transportation has been greatly inconvenienced. The cars and gasoline needed are all transported to the mainland via this highway, so this highway is quite important to China. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Major Victory for Chinese Army in Southern Henan; Several Important Cities Recovered; Total Japanese Casualties Reach 20,000</h3>

When the Japanese army began its offensive on January 24, the Chinese army retreated to prepared positions according to plan and lured the Japanese army away from its base. The Chinese army then launched a general counter-offensive, repelling the Japanese army and recovering many towns along the Pinghan Railway. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The "Lend-Lease Act" Under Discussion in the US Congress</h3>
<p>January 10, 1941, is a day worth commemorating in history! On this day, US President Roosevelt, together with eight congressional leaders, five government officials, and the chairman of the National Defense Commission, held an important meeting to discuss the Lend-Lease Act. This is a plan of epoch-making significance. According to this plan, the United States will aid China, Britain, Greece, and other countries resisting aggression to achieve victory. After this summit meeting, Senator Barkley and Representative McCormack presented the bill for discussion in the Senate and House of Representatives, respectively. It has been more than three weeks since then. During this period, on the one hand, the entire United States has concentrated its efforts on exploration, and on the other hand, the democratic countries resisting aggression have appealed. Countering this, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan have desperately threatened and obstructed. How the world situation will unfold in the future is undoubtedly a major pivot.</p>
<p>Roosevelt once said in his fireside chat that the most fundamental significance of all current work in the United States lies in turning the United States into the "arsenal" of all democratic countries. We recall that before the outbreak of the European War, he also issued a solemn warning to the two dictators of Germany and Italy, urging them to resolve all disputes peacefully with Britain and France at that time; otherwise, after the outbreak of the war, it would inevitably drag a country even larger than the combined forces of Germany and Italy into the whirlpool of war. This time's "Lend-Lease Act" is the follow-up to that warning, the practice of the "arsenal" promise; and at the same time, it also pushes the United States to the edge of actual participation in the war.</p>
<p>Looking at the debates and opinions from all aspects of the United States over the past three weeks, it seems that the first focus of the dispute lies in the question of whether it is necessary or not. Powerful figures who support this bill, such as the new Vice President Wallace, said: "If Germany wins, its first step against the United States will be a large-scale economic war, and after that, it will immediately be military aggression." Former Ambassador to France Bullitt said: "Unless the United States immediately aids China, Britain, Greece, and other countries, the United States will one day be invaded by Germany." Former Ambassador to Britain Kennedy said: "The British authorities feel that the assistance the United States is giving them is not reaching the level they expected." Under such powerful opinions, the "Lend-Lease Act" has safely passed the first hurdle of necessity or not, which means that it is extremely necessary!</p>
<p>The second point of discussion is the legal issue. The biggest reason for the opposition is that it violates "neutrality" and conflicts with the principles of international law. However, the supporters immediately gave a strong reply: The biggest problem facing the United States today is the life and death of itself and other democratic countries. If we still bring up the principles of international law at this time, it would be equivalent to helping Germany, Italy, and Japan, and the result would be enough to promote its own destruction. For example, Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Secretary of War Stimson have all made strong statements on this point. So far, the reasons of the supporters of the "Lend-Lease Act" have completely defeated the so-called "neutrality" of the isolationists.</p>
<p>The third focus of discussion is the issue of restricting the powers of the President. On this issue, the opposition can be roughly divided into two viewpoints: one is represented by Hoover, Dewey, and others, who unconditionally oppose the passage of the "Lend-Lease Act" in the position of political enemies of Roosevelt, believing that in that case, the United States has actually become a dictatorial country, and the President is the dictator. The other opposition is from Roosevelt's own party, and their reason for opposition is based on an assessment of Roosevelt's personal character, believing that if this bill is passed, he will use the power he has to drag the United States into war. However, the reasons of the supporters have more sound arguments. They believe that in such an urgent international situation, what the United States needs most in its actions now is speed and breadth. In order to achieve this goal, the President should be given full power to act expediently. So far, the latter faction has completely won, but the summary result is that a two-year time limit has been added to this power; that is, these two years have given Roosevelt enough room to operate and deal with everything.</p>
<p>The fourth focus is the issue of limiting the scope of application. If the first three foci are assumed to be without problems, that is, after the government faction wins, then the so-called point of scope of application should be exactly as in the original case; in other words, the Lend-Lease Act is fully applicable to all democratic countries that resist aggression and fight for freedom, such as China, Britain, Greece, and so on. However, the opposition has raised objections in many ways. The largest category is that the application of this bill should be limited to Britain. The second category is to further advocate that the object of application of this bill should be particularly for the British mainland, Canada, and other autonomous territories, as well as the British colonies, in the form of "grants"; in other words, even Britain's allies should be excluded. The most famous of this faction are the so-called "Substitute Bill" proposed by the Democratic Party, the proposal of "Isolationist" leader Johnson, and the proposal of another leader, Taft. However, the evolution of the world situation and the reactions of the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan in recent days have fully proved the correctness of the opinions of the supporters and strengthened their strength. When Hull delivered a speech on the 16th of last month denouncing the world's aggressive forces, he began by talking about Japan's invasion of northeastern China in 1931. Therefore, in terms of the scope of application, Roosevelt's principle of aiding all democratic countries has actually been completely established.</p>
<p>The "Lend-Lease Act" will soon be put to the final debate and vote. Its passage has now become a foregone conclusion. According to general estimates, its favorable advantage will probably reach a ratio of two to one. In the near future, we can expect further solid and courageous actions from the United States to gradually implement its program to defeat the "New Order"!</p>
<h3>Germany Encourages Japan to Advance Southward, Restraining the United Anglo-American Front; Japan's Control of Vietnam as a Precursor to Invading Singapore; American Newspapers Praise the Netherlands East Indies' Unyielding Attitude</h3>
<p>Washington - The terms of the ceasefire agreement between Thailand and Vietnam have not yet been announced. However, the notion that Japan has taken advantage of the opportunity to reap benefits, which has been circulating in the Far East, was anticipated by people here and is not surprising. Analysts of the current situation believe that Japan is using the guise of mediation to secure practical benefits without resorting to force. Well-informed sources here generally believe that Japan's new tactics are in collusion with the Axis powers. It is almost impossible to believe that the recent events in Vietnam are unrelated to the forces of Berlin because the situation in Vietnam and the Axis situation are essentially the same, which cannot but raise doubts. This view is quite evident, that Berlin intends to place Japan in a position where it can readily attack Singapore and Rangoon and, if development goes smoothly, can further invade the Dutch East Indies. Although Japan may not be able to carry out this kind of threat in the near future, it has taken a further step in its strong determination to advance southward, as mentioned recently by its Foreign Minister Matsuoka. Yesterday, "The Washington Star" commented on the political situation arising from Japan's continued violation of Vietnamese sovereignty, calling it a hurricane climate and stating that in this climate, the news that the Dutch East Indies has refused to join Japan's "New Order" is truly invigorating. "The New York Post" also commented on the Dutch East Indies' announcement of not participating in Japan's "New Order," saying that although Japan has achieved its ambitions in Vietnam, this announcement will certainly displease it. Those naval and military personnel, with a pirate mentality, encourage each other to advance southward, hoping to gain without effort, will now realize the reason why planned matters are underestimated and robbery is not easy. They may think that the Dutch East Indies would not dare to make this announcement without British encouragement or secret military and naval assistance from the United States. The Germans are likely to gladly believe this to be true, as the only purpose Germany hopes Japan will serve is to restrain the United States from focusing solely on Europe. However, the Japanese may not welcome this because what Japan wants to use Germany for is nothing more than to prevent the British navy from looking eastward when Japan seizes the opportunity to gain benefits. The Japanese would rather see American warships in the Atlantic sinking German submarines than see them appearing in the western Pacific, providing those whom Japan wants to invade with the ability to resist, which is now despised by the occupying forces who are viewed lightly by the Chinese. Whether the Dutch East Indies has obtained a guarantee of American assistance is still questionable. However, the Dutch East Indies' announcement of not participating in Japan's "New Order" is indeed a wise move. Vietnam can serve as a lesson: submission to Japan yields nothing, and the best way to gain American assistance is to rise up and prepare for war. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - Knowledgeable people here said yesterday that, as a result of the policy of aiding Britain, the US government now expects that British and American defense equipment will be used by each other without distinction. On the same note, it was strongly argued that the current trend of US foreign policy is likely to develop in this direction. Some believe that in order to maintain world peace after the war, it is necessary to establish its foundation on Anglo-American political and economic cooperation. According to him, the above-mentioned trend is being promoted by these people. According to the opinions of administrative officials, they also expect that in the future, Britain and the United States will use each other's defense equipment, in addition to manpower, to resist aggression. They expect that Britain and the United States will not only exchange naval and military bases but also "lend-lease" all kinds of necessary defense items, including warships. Therefore, people generally expect that the two countries will use each other's needed defense materials, and in practice, they may not be involved in the war. The Lend-Lease Act authorizes the President to allow British warships to use US bases and can allow Britain to lease any defense equipment, including warships. US government officials hope to use defense materials with Britain without distinction in exchange for American assistance. Knowledgeable people here say that the United States is very willing to use the ports and airfields of southeastern Australia and northern New Zealand. The initial benefits sought by President Roosevelt now may be the above-mentioned points. It is indicated that if the United States can use bases in Australia and New Zealand, it can strengthen the United States' means against Japan. Military experts believe that this move can keep the Philippines out of Japan's range of attack and allow the United States to gain an advantage in the South China Sea.

<h3>The Dutch East Indies Included in the "Co-Prosperity Sphere"; The Dutch Government Lodges a Protest; The Japanese Side Indicates Its Determination to Reject It; Negotiations in Batavia Stalled</h3>
<p>Batavia - Well-informed sources in the Dutch East Indies believed yesterday that Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi's rejection of Dutch Ambassador to Japan Pabst's views on the independence of the Dutch East Indies was inexplicable. The reason being that Pabst had a discussion with Ohashi the previous week regarding the inclusion of the Dutch East Indies in the scope of Japan's dream of the "East Asia New Order." He notified Ohashi that he had received instructions from the Dutch government in London to reject Japan's attempt to include the Dutch East Indies in Japan's "Co-Prosperity Sphere." It is heard that Ohashi also rejected the Dutch protest at the time, pointing out that Japan's plan to include the Dutch East Indies in the Co-Prosperity Sphere only concerns economic factors and not political factors. It is rumored from the Japanese side that the explanation regarding Japan's inclusion of the Dutch East Indies in the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" has been made clear by Ohashi, so the current Dutch-Japanese economic negotiations in Batavia will continue to be based on economics, and the attitude of the Dutch government in London can be ignored. As for the Dutch in Batavia commenting on Ohashi's rejection of Pabst's protest and the Japanese statement to Pabst later, they said that the relationship between the Dutch government and the Dutch East Indies is a "factual situation" and there is no need for the Japanese to reject acceptance or discuss it. The Japanese Vice Foreign Minister's statement that the Dutch government does not need to interfere with Japan's "Greater East Asia" plan is completely incomprehensible. The Japanese must know that negotiations are currently being conducted with representatives sent by the Dutch government. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Information Bureau spokesman Ishii stated today while receiving foreign visitors that the Dutch envoy to Japan presented the Japanese government last Friday with a memorandum from the Dutch government in London, protesting Japan's inclusion of the Dutch East Indies into the East Asian New Order's Co-Prosperity Sphere. He said that Vice Minister Ohashi's attitude almost indicated that the Dutch government in London was not qualified to manage this matter, and that the Vice Minister did not pay much attention to this memorandum. When asked if the Vice Minister refused to recognize the Dutch government in London, Ishii replied, "I cannot say that he definitely does." When asked which government Japan recognizes as the Dutch government, Ishii replied that the Japanese government legally recognizes the Dutch government in London, but in reality, it should be discussed separately. For example, regarding negotiations on the affairs of the Dutch East Indies, Japan can only deal with the government of the Dutch East Indies. When asked if Japan refuses to recognize the Polish and Norwegian governments in London, Ishii replied that this is a delicate issue and must be discussed on a case-by-case basis. Ishii also hinted that the position of the Dutch envoy to Japan is very difficult, as he cannot represent the Dutch government in London, nor does he represent the government of the Dutch East Indies. When asked if the talks between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia have stalled, Ishii replied no, and that they are still in progress. It is expected that the government of the Dutch East Indies will submit a counter-proposal to the Japanese delegation in the middle of this week. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to semi-official Japanese sources in Batavia, Dutch East Indies government spokesman Leitman warned that if the reasons for Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi's rejection of the Dutch note of January 31st are not clarified, the continuation of the Dutch East Indies and Japan conference in Batavia will be difficult. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Batavia - News today, the Dutch authorities have refused the Japanese request that the Dutch East Indies allow Japan to have a superior position in the Dutch East Indies in terms of commerce or development. The Dutch rejection was conveyed to the Japanese side by Van Mook, the chief Dutch representative in the Dutch-Japanese talks, when he submitted a counter-proposal to the Japanese side yesterday. The Dutch East Indies' reply not only refuses to allow Japan to obtain a superior position, but also refuses to consider it. However, it is also heard that Van Mook said that the Dutch East Indies is prepared to discuss the development of regular trade relations with Japan. Yoshizawa, the chief Japanese representative in the Dutch-Japanese talks, told a United Press reporter that the Japanese delegation has prepared a new proposal for later discussion. Yoshizawa also expressed hope that negotiations would begin immediately. It is also officially recognized here that Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi's recent statement to Dutch Minister to Japan Pabst is a serious obstacle to future negotiations.

<h3>Japan Considers Invoking Belligerent Rights to Prevent Third-Party Aid to China; Matsuoka Says He Has Not Abandoned Adjusting US-Japan Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently issued a statement saying that the Japanese government will consider all belligerent rights to deal with third countries in the Sino-Japanese War, and expressed hope that Japan has not abandoned improving US-Japan relations. During his statement, the Japanese Foreign Minister was asked whether Japan would go to war with the United States if the United States were at war with Germany and Italy, and whether Japan's allies would abandon Japan in danger and stand idly by if the Soviet Union attacked Japan. Matsuoka refused to answer both questions. Matsuoka's statement was made at an open meeting of the Lower House Budget Committee, at a time when the secret meeting of the Japanese House of Peers Budget Committee was attracting attention because of reports that former Foreign Minister Arita had questioned Matsuoka on some issues regarding Japan's foreign policy. Japanese evening newspapers all revealed indirect criticisms of the mystery surrounding the questioning and answering of this important issue. A man named Imai asked Matsuoka whether the resolution of the Sino-Japanese War would not proceed smoothly if ships carrying military supplies to Chongqing were sunk. Matsuoka then replied that the Japanese government has indeed implemented belligerent rights within the necessary scope, and the full implementation of belligerent rights is under consideration. Imai then asked whether Japan must act according to the Tripartite Pact if the United States joins the European war, and whether Germany and Italy would not be able to help Japan if the Soviet Union attacked Japan. The Foreign Minister refused to answer these two questions, but pointed out that the main purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to adjust Japanese-Soviet relations, and Germany and Italy will also be friendly with the Soviet Union. "I want to act according to the current trend, and as for the future, we can only let it be." Matsuoka agreed with the views of the earlier questioner Tsurumi, saying that we must inform the United States of the fact that the Japanese economy does not depend on the United Kingdom and the United States. "I now want to clearly explain that our southward advance policy is beneficial to both Japan and the United States. In addition, I want to tell the United States that our Tripartite Pact is not intended to attack the United States, and its purpose is to prevent war with the United States," and so on.

<h3>Japan's Southward Advance, Signs Increasingly Apparent</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to semi-official Chinese sources, Japan's intensification of its southward advance is becoming increasingly apparent. Recently, in addition to increasing marines in the Spratly Islands, Japan has also added weather stations and radio stations. Radio stations have also been established on Bonaparten Island south of Hong Kong. The 28th Division, originally stationed on Hainan Island, will be transferred to the Hanoi area to threaten Burma. Military experts here believe that all of this proves that Japan is preparing for a southward advance. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Japanese Negotiations on New Fisheries Agreement; Candidates for Both Delegations; Commercial Negotiations to Resume</h3>
<p>Moscow - On January 21, 1941, the Soviet Union and Japan signed an agreement stipulating the establishment of a committee to draft a new fisheries agreement. Now, in accordance with that agreement, the Soviet government has appointed a negotiation delegation, the list of which is as follows: People's Committee Member Lovsky (Head of the Delegation), Director of the Second Far East Department of the People's Foreign Committee Chalapkin (Deputy Head of the Delegation), Director of the Legal Department of the Foreign Committee Pavlov, Director of the Eastern Department of the People's Committee for Foreign Trade Gumikin, Director of the Foreign Exchange Department of the People's Finance Committee Chairubin. In addition, Bavlichev was appointed as the secretary of the delegation. On the other hand, the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union has notified the Soviet Union that the Japanese delegation has also been appointed, and the list is as follows: Nishiharu Hiko (Head of the Delegation), Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union Yoshikawa (Deputy Head of the Delegation), First Secretary of the Japanese Embassy in the Soviet Union Saito, etc. (Tass, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - A Japanese government spokesman announced this morning that Soviet-Japanese commercial negotiations will soon resume, and the shipment of Japanese goods to Germany may also be included. The commercial chop was suspended by the Soviet Union last year, at which time the opinions of both sides were not far apart (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>US Defense Materials Sold to Japan; Congressman Questions Government</h3>
<p>Washington - Oregon Republican Senator Holman protested on the floor yesterday that the United States is still selling important defense materials to Japan at a time when it deeply believes it is threatened by Japan. Holman said that a large amount of defense materials are still being shipped to Russia from the US West Coast, including tinplate worth $400,000 and thousands of aviation beacons, and demanded that the government provide an explanation. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<h3>US Government Restricts Oil and Cotton Exports; To Implement a License System</h3>
<p>New York - According to the New York Herald, President Roosevelt may propose a licensing method to restrict the export of cotton and gasoline. The official explanation for this move will be that it is necessary to place the export of various raw materials needed by industry under national control. However, the real reason is said to be due to the informal complaint from British Ambassador Halifax that batches of gasoline shipped from the United States to the Soviet Union are ultimately reaching Germany. The newspaper also believes that the proposal of this licensing method is a response to Japan's increased influence in Vietnam. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>British Forces in North Africa Prepare for Attack on Benghazi; South African Troops Gain Important Stronghold in Algerian Territory; One-Fourth of Italian Colonies Lost</h3>
<p>Cairo - British headquarters communique states that the British mechanized team in Eritrea (west coast of the Red Sea) is pressing on the Italian army. The Italian army is retreating towards the railway to Karen. Also, the Italian army in Abyssinia is retreating to the northwest towards Gondar. The British army is in close pursuit. The British detachment is still very active in Italian Somaliland, penetrating deep into Italian territory. In Libya, everything is now arranged to strike Benghazi directly from Derna (where the headquarters of the Italian army in Libya is located). (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Cairo - A British Air Force communique states that on Sunday, British bombers and fighters heavily attacked the highway between Derna and Benghazi in Libya. Italian troops and trucks in Slonta, 25 miles southwest of Apollonia, were also strafed by British aircraft, destroying 13 trucks. British aircraft also attacked motor transport vehicles on the highway between Maraua and Gaba. The Apollonia airfield was attacked, destroying three twin-engine monoplanes and one Caproni bomber. Italian troops and convoys in the area were also strafed. In Chigar, ten miles south of Apollonia, an Italian Fiat biplane was shot down. On February 1, the South African British Air Force bombed enemy artillery positions in East Africa. The British Air Force also assisted the army in the attack, dive-bombing the Barentu fort and buildings. A motor transport convoy concentrated in one place was also bombed, destroying at least 50 vehicles. Motor vehicles and highways concentrated west of Asmara were heavily bombed. Also, a Savoia Italian bomber was shot down in Agordat. All British aircraft returned safely except for one. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Nairobi - South African British troops have entered Abyssinian territory, seizing two Italian army outposts and gaining a foothold. An official report states that South African British troops have occupied two Italian army outposts within ten miles of the Abyssinian border at El Geermo and Gorai. Two Italian army officers and 43 soldiers were killed, and another three officers and 50 soldiers, along with machine guns, rifles, and ammunition, were captured. British casualties were very slight. After this victory, the British army occupied the Hobok outpost, seven miles north of the border, west of Gorai. British army patrols in other areas continued to be active. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>New Delhi - A communique states that Indian mechanized cavalry, infantry, and engineers are now participating in the war in Italian East Africa. According to recent reports, Indian engineers and mine-laying troops are working in the valley near Koro, with excellent results. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London - British troops are now tracking Italian troops along the post road from Barentu to the southeast and attacking them fiercely. In the northern sector, British troops in trucks, led by light armored vehicles, continue to advance towards Kiren, 50 miles east of Agordat. The difficulties encountered by the British army are increasing because, due to the terrain, it is difficult to clearly define the front line in Eritrea. However, it is estimated that the land occupied by the British army is about 10,000 square miles, or about one-fourth of the Italian colony. It is heard that the British army in Abyssinia is advancing towards Gondar, 90 miles from the Sudanese border, and the situation is quite successful. The Italian army there continues to retreat eastward and is being pursued along the way by Abyssinian patriots and British troops. In the Somaliland sector, the British scout team is now deeply pressing into enemy territory. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Greek Troops in Southern Albania Close to Vlora Port; Central Front Consolidates New Positions</h3>
<p>Southern Greece, Syriuga - Border reports state that after weeks of hard fighting, Greek troops reached the coast of Vlora Bay yesterday, occupying Dukati Bay (at the southern end of Vlora Bay), 17 kilometers from Vlora City. Another column of Greek troops on that road also advanced in the Karaunia Mountains, occupying the Italian fortresses guarding the gates of Vlora. Other Greek troops are also in pursuit of Italian troops. (United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Athens - War report: Just as heavy rains poured down on the Albanian front, indicating the end of winter, Greek troops were consolidating their lines in central Albania yesterday, preparing to inflict a fatal blow on the Italian army in the area and destroy it completely. Military observers believe that the occupation of Mount Tremsehna will make it easier for General Papagos's army to make a final offensive towards Tepelena and other bases in the area. According to captured Italian officers, Italian Chief of Staff General Cavallero, Foreign Minister Ciano, and Fascist Party Secretary General Farinacci have all arrived at the central front, planning to reorganize the Italian army in the area. Italian prisoners claimed that General Cavallero ordered that those who retreated would be shot immediately, and soldiers who made defeatist remarks would also be subject to the same punishment. The Italian army is now transferring reinforcements from various fronts to central Albania with the most rapid action. (International Society, 4th)</p>
<h3>Germany Seeks to Facilitate Greek-Italian Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Sofia - According to reliable sources yesterday, when British Middle East Commander-in-Chief General Wavell recently went to Athens, the Greeks requested more British military aid. It is believed that General Wavell told the Greek authorities that Britain could provide large-scale assistance to Greek troops as soon as the Italian army's stronghold of Benghazi in northern Libya fell into British hands. However, it is believed that the general also said that Britain could not assist Greece temporarily. Reliable sources believe that before Britain can effectively assist Greece and open a new front in the southeast to resist the German army, it will try to make Italy and Greece reconcile.

<h3>Roosevelt's Special Envoy Leaves Turkey for Egypt; American Activities in the Balkans Make Berlin Uneasy</h3>
<p>Turkey - Colonel Donovan, the personal representative of President Roosevelt, left here last night for Cairo. Turkish government representatives and US embassy officials went to the station to see him off. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Roosevelt's representative Donovan is now touring the Balkan countries, and German diplomats are very uneasy, saying that Donovan is encouraging countries to take a unified stand against the pressure of the Axis powers and deal with it boldly. The Germans are troubled by the US interference in matters that are unrelated to the US. What is incomprehensible is that if Germany has no new plans in the Balkans, then why should it be so worried? Turks have differing opinions on this point. Reading Hitler's recent speech, some Turks believe that if Britain does not open a new front against the Axis powers via Thessaloniki, then Germany will not take any action in the Balkans. Others say that Hitler has decided that British troops will land in Thessaloniki, so he will use this as an excuse to occupy Bulgaria. The Germans are now spreading rumors that British troops have already landed at that port. It is heard that Donovan told the Turks that if Turkey participates in the war against Germany and is willing to receive material assistance from the United States, it will certainly receive it.

<h3>Soviet-Turkish Agreement Theory, Soviet Union Denies</h3>
<p>Moscow - Foreign newspapers (especially British newspapers) claim, "The Soviet Union and Turkey have established a secret agreement. The Soviet Union will supply Turkey with military fire to cope with German actions in the Balkans. Regarding this matter, Turkey has organized a delegation to go to Moscow to purchase military fire." Tass recently issued a statement authorized by the official, "The Soviet Union and Turkey have not established any agreement or secret agreement, and there is no intention to conclude an agreement. There is no delegation from Turkey to purchase military fire in Moscow at present. The rumors spread by foreign newspapers are purely fabricated." (Tass, 4th)</p>

<p>Hungarian Capital - The flood near the Hungarian capital has become a disaster. Due to the flooding of the Danube River, 10,000 acres of land have been submerged, and the dikes have collapsed and been washed away. The water level is as high as 15 meters higher than before. Several towns and villages are like islands in the middle of the water. There are also frozen ice floes. Natgrel, the pig-producing center, now has 40,000 pigs in danger. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<h3>Turkey and Bulgaria Intensify Military Preparations; Two Countries Engage in Diplomatic Negotiations to Cooperatively Maintain Balkan Peace</h3>
<p>Budapest: Reports indicate that Turkey and Bulgaria are intensifying military preparations. Key locations on Turkey's Thracian border have long been heavily defended. Sources say that Turkey has dispatched additional troops to reinforce the Thracian border defenses. Simultaneously, Bulgaria is reportedly mobilizing two classes of reservists. (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>Sofia: Bulgarian Minister to Turkey, Kiroff, is currently engaged in negotiations with the Turkish government, aiming for mutual cooperation between the two countries to maintain Balkan peace. Regarding this matter, the Turkish government, based on British advice, proposed an agreement with Bulgaria last December, solemnly stipulating that neither country would allow the armies of third countries to pass through their territories. However, this was rejected by the Bulgarian authorities. The matter has now been brought up again. Bulgaria insists that the agreement to be concluded between the two countries should indirectly state that even if Bulgaria is occupied by another country, Turkey will not consider it an unfriendly act and therefore need not intervene. However, whether this agreement will materialize remains uncertain. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Willkie Granted Audience with the King; Trip to Southern Ireland</p>
<p>London: Wendell Willkie, the former Republican presidential candidate of the United States, is currently on an extensive tour of Britain under wartime conditions. It is expected that Willkie will have an audience with the King and Queen today. Yesterday, Willkie visited Liverpool to inspect the aftermath of the bombings. After touring the bombed areas, he arrived at the City Hall and stated that what he had seen proved that this kind of war, though extremely brutal, had not achieved the desired effect of slaughtering civilians or shaking morale, but had instead strengthened the determination of the people. Willkie also emphasized the importance of effective industrial production during wartime. Willkie then toured the dock area, where workers praised him as a great man. Willkie also spent an hour touring the bombed and damaged areas of Manchester, where he was warmly welcomed by the public, with a level of enthusiasm unseen in the area for many years. Vehicle traffic was repeatedly blocked by the crowds, and the authorities had to deploy additional police to prevent Willkie from being surrounded and unable to leave. Willkie told reporters, "The questions I came here to ask have been answered." Willkie mentioned his conversations with hundreds of civilians, saying, "The people's spirit is strong and resilient. He does not believe that the unity of the people in any country in the world is greater than that of the people of the British Isles. He was more impressed by the continuing industrial production than by the devastation he saw. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>London: Wendell Willkie, the former Republican presidential candidate of the United States, finally had the opportunity to travel to Southern Ireland. Willkie suddenly made preparations last night and flew to Dublin this morning. However, his stay in Southern Ireland will be limited to a meeting with de Valera, hoping to return here in time to implement his plan to return home early and testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Lend-Lease Act.

<h3>US Naval Circles Estimate: French Fleet Still Retains Three-Quarters of its Strength</h3>
<p>Washington: According to information disclosed by the US Naval High Command to members of Congress yesterday, three-quarters of the French fleet remains intact and is the strongest weapon that French Premier Marshal Pétain uses to reject German demands. Admiral Stark made this accurate statement for the first time in a closed session of the House Naval Affairs Committee. Stark stated that the Germans wanted to use the French fleet for an invasion of Britain. If the invasion failed, they could still use it in the Mediterranean. Captain Knox testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stating that he knew that German leader Hitler was currently "negotiating" to acquire the French fleet. We should recall that after the fall of France, the British fleet clashed with the French fleet in the Battle of Mers-el-Kébir, where several French ships were sunk by the British, including at least two French cruisers. At the time, it was claimed that most of the French fleet had either been captured or sunk by the British, but subsequent evidence proved that this information was exaggerated. According to Admiral Stark's statement to the House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday, it was the first official report revealing that three-quarters of the French fleet remains completely intact.

<h3>Cabinet Changes Expected in Paris Discussions; Laval Rumored to Join Cabinet and Assume Power; Laval and Pétain Cooperate to Resolve Current Crisis</h3>
<p>Vichy: Following a meeting between French Naval Chief Admiral Darlan, former Deputy Prime Minister Laval, and German Ambassador Abetz in Paris, the 50-day deadlock in Franco-German relations appears to be coming to an end. Observers predict that the current Vichy cabinet will fall within a week, and Laval, a favorite of Germany, will join the new cabinet and assume power, guaranteeing cooperation with Germany. United Press International has learned that considerable progress has been made in resolving the crisis. France appears to be leaning towards a government led by Laval, Baudouin, Admiral Darlan, and General Huntziger, with Laval wielding great power. Observers believe that Marshal Pétain will retain full authority as the head of government, Admiral Darlan will be responsible for internal affairs, Laval will be Minister of Foreign Affairs and Propaganda, General Huntziger will be Minister of Defense, and Baudouin will be responsible for all technical departments, including finance, labor, production, agriculture, and transportation. Recently, Admiral Darlan stated in the Official Gazette yesterday that the French fleet, both now and in the future, will "under French authority, unite and defend the homeland and empire against attacks and provocations from any direction." (United Press International, 4th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Following the official announcement that Vichy government Naval Chief Admiral Darlan had departed for Paris, conflicting rumors about Darlan's intentions and whereabouts spread throughout the day. On Monday morning, Swiss radio reported that Darlan had indeed gone to Paris. Subsequently, a report from Budapest confirmed this, stating that German authorities had notified Darlan that further talks between France and Germany would be futile unless Vichy understood the situation created by the National Unity Party's organization. The National Unity Party was established by the Nazis in the French occupied zone and is in conflict with Marshal Pétain, the head of the Vichy government. Later reports indicated that Darlan hoped to find harmony and a solution for France between the Vichy government and the new party. Whether Darlan's efforts in Paris are successful may have a significant impact on the near future of Europe. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>New York: According to sources in Paris, Vichy Naval Chief Admiral Darlan's talks with German leaders in Paris appear to be aimed at seeking a compromise between the Paris Committee and Vichy. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>Voroshilov's 60th Birthday Celebration</h3>
<p>Moscow: On the occasion of Marshal Voroshilov's 60th birthday, the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Council of People's Commissars sent a congratulatory letter, stating, "Comrade Voroshilov, as a loyal comrade of Lenin and Stalin, you have made great contributions to the establishment of the Communist Party and the organization of the Red Army. On the occasion of your 60th birthday, we send our congratulations. In your youth, you dedicated yourself to the revolution. During the First Revolution from 1905 to 1907, you led the workers of the Donets Basin in battle, and together with Lenin and Stalin, you established the Bolshevik Party. You were an enthusiastic participant in the October Revolution and a key figure in the organization of the Red Army. In 1918, under your leadership, the Ukrainian Fifth Army defeated the White Cossacks and reached Stalingrad. The organization of the Red Army cavalry was also initiated by you. With the assistance of the cavalry, the Red Army embarked on a path of glorious victory and defeated Denikin's counter-revolutionary forces. The strength of the Red Army today is due to your guidance. The Party deeply knows that you are one of the bravest in fighting against the enemies of the Soviet Union. Your tireless spirit of struggle has won the love of all Soviet people. We wish you longevity so that you can continue to achieve further success for the Soviet Union and the Communist Party."

<h3>London Times Reviews Japan's Policy; Warmongering Acts Border on Suicide; Ambitions for Hegemony Are Just Dreams</h3>
<p>London: The London Times published an editorial entitled "The Turbulence of Japan's Policy," summarizing the trends in Japan's foreign policy in recent years. The article is as follows:</p>
<p>Starting with the September 18th Incident</p>
<p>When Japan embarked on the long and still irreversible path in Manchuria on the night of September 18, 1931, its leaders possessed a cleverness in moving its people and the world with effect first, cause later. They first created the shadow of an event and then created the reality of the event, thereby fulfilling their wish to prove the legitimacy of their actions. When the Manchurian Incident occurred, the world was caught off guard and did not yet know this new trick. However, since then, this trick has become well-known, and even Hitler has not hesitated to imitate Japan, using the threat of weak countries as an excuse to annex them under the pretext of self-defense. The habit of creating intimidating slogans also originated from the Manchurian Incident. In 1931, we frequently heard about the 30 million oppressed people of Manchuria. Japanese speakers often uttered such figures. Before long, the world was repeatedly hearing about the hundreds of millions of oppressed people of China. Today, the world is gradually hearing about the several million oppressed people of Vietnam, Malaya, Burma, and other countries groaning under the bondage of white people. This is not without significance.</p>
<p>Matsuoka's Remarks Conceal Ambition</p>
<p>The recent remarks by the Japanese Foreign Minister in the Diet were also full of slogans. Matsuoka denounced the news of the failure of the Italian army as malicious propaganda. In fact, the Italian army's defeat has already been admitted by Italy itself. Matsuoka expressed friendship towards the Axis, moderation towards the Soviet Union, friendliness towards South America, and threats towards Vietnam, Thailand, and the Dutch East Indies. However, the real meaning of his remarks is clearly to create the shadow of Japan being surrounded by Britain and the United States. His remarks are almost identical to those made by Germany. In fact, the British Empire is engaged in an unprecedented struggle with a strong enemy, and the United States is preparing to support the British Empire. It is impossible to spare the time and energy to surround Japan. This is almost unbelievable, but those who believe in Germany will believe it. Is the shadow of encirclement a shadow that comes before the event? Will this event eventually become inevitable for Japan to act? This certainly coincides with the trick mentioned in the first paragraph of this article. However, is Japan actually going to take such a dangerous and suicidal course of action? It seems incredible.</p>
<p>Rivalry between China and Japan Is Difficult to Eradicate</p>
<p>The European War from 1914 to 1918 gave Japan an unprecedented opportunity to expand its trade. Japan was one of the signatories to the peace treaty (a point that Germany and Japan have deliberately ignored), reaping the benefits of the Allied victory. The Marshall and Caroline Islands, originally belonging to Germany, were placed under Japanese administration. However, Japan has long been unwilling to publicly disclose the details of the administration and development of these islands. During the last war, the Allies sacrificed countless lives and treasure. Compared to what Japan sacrificed at the time, the difference is like heaven and earth. Japan enjoyed years of prosperity and peace as a result of the Allies' bloodshed and financial losses. However, the speculative trend of Japanese finance eventually led to the Great Depression of 1929 hitting Japan harder than other countries. However, at that time, the trend of blaming others for one's own problems was not yet prevalent. Before the autumn of 1931, Japan still pursued a steady and prudent policy, seeking to restore its trade and financial position in the usual way. Not only that, but Japan also pursued a legitimate policy of seeking China's friendship. This was the only way for Japan to secure a large share of the Chinese market. Japan, due to its geographical proximity and low manufacturing costs, could occupy a large share of the Chinese market. However, the long record of rivalry between China and Japan, especially starting with the 1895 war and the Twenty-One Demands of 1915, was difficult to eradicate. Japan's former patience, which had earned it the respect of other countries, was eventually overshadowed by the rapidly growing ambition and pragmatism within the country. Thus, some members of the army attempted to take a shortcut to prosperity in September 1931. From then on, Japan embarked on a path of aggression contrary to peace, using force instead of negotiation to resolve disputes. After Manchuria had fallen, a puppet regime was established. In early 1935, mainland China, or at least North China, had clearly become the second stepping stone for Japan's expansion.</p>
<p>War of Aggression against China Falls into Quagmire</p>
<p>The hostilities that began in 1937 have lasted for four years and are still not over. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people have suffered. Chinese ports and many large cities have been occupied. However, four years of war have not allowed Japan to achieve its goals, nor have they changed the Chinese people's determination to be masters of their own destiny. The Japanese people initially thought that the war against China would be short and glorious. They did not expect it to be so prolonged. In order to explain the prolongation of the war, the Japanese authorities had to blame others. Although they blamed more than one country, they often pointed to Britain as the main culprit in this drama. Britain has more rights in China than any other country. Japan's attacks on Britain are certainly appropriate, because to exclude the influence of Western countries in China, the first goal must be to exclude Britain. The sympathy of the British people is inclined towards China, and Britain, like other countries, has given some material assistance to China. However, this sympathy and this limited assistance are not the reasons for the courage of China to resist. It can be said that what has contributed to the courage of China to resist is Japan itself. Japan, with its actions to dominate China, has made China strive to become a large group with the determination to resist, and has aroused the fighting spirit that was previously unseen among this peace-loving nation. What Japan has already brought about is what it wants to eliminate. It is hardly surprising that it is now blaming others.</p>
<p>Willing to Be a Tool of the Axis Powers</p>
<p>The war in China has become sticky, and the European war has given Japan a possible opportunity. Japan initially had no activities and was willing to be passive, but in late June 1940, when Germany had captured Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France, Japan saw clear evidence of the benefits of aggression, reorganized the government, and appointed Matsuoka as its spokesman. Soon after, it signed the Tripartite Pact, openly joining the ranks of those hostile to Britain and threatening the United States to deter it from interfering in the European war. Unfortunately, after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, Hitler's promise to the world, especially to Japan, that Britain would soon be overthrown did not seem to be realized. Since Britain was not overthrown and the United States had an unexpectedly strong reaction to the Tripartite Pact, Japan did hesitate somewhat, and the world sometimes heard that this alliance was merely a formality and sometimes that this alliance would definitely be implemented. Germany remained active, whispering to Japan that everything was going well, that the United States was not prepared for war, and that a little show of strength would be enough to scare it away. Britain has not been overthrown for the time being, but this is only to make this overthrow more effective. What Germany told Japan was nothing more than that if Japan had the courage to let go and do what it wanted, then what it wanted would be in its grasp. What Germany wanted was for Japan to join the war to help Germany. Even if Japan did not win, it would not matter to Germany. At most, the three powers would turn from strong to weak. As for Japan being able to share the new world order with Germany on an equal footing, this was certainly not in Hitler's plans. Japan's position is only as a tool, not as a colleague.</p>
<p>Reckless Adventure Puts National Destiny in Danger</p>
<p>From Matsuoka's remarks, Germany could see that its instigation was indeed effective. Matsuoka's remarks not only threatened the security of Thailand, Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies, but also the security of Britain and the United States. If Japan actually carries out its threats, it will see a firm defense and see the new weapons it uses, just as Matsuoka said. However, what Japan does not yet know is that Matsuoka's real threat is not detrimental to the security of the aforementioned countries, but detrimental to the peace, prosperity, and happiness of the Japanese people. Japan has been engaged in conquest for ten years and has never brought spiritual or material benefits to its people. Now, after four years of war in China, there have been many deaths and great losses, but no effect. The Japanese authorities are now urging their people to believe that aggression is the best speculation. Although previous efforts have not yielded benefits, if more capital and sacrifices are added, the future gains will be many, not just dividends. This behavior that disregards human value will be assimilated with Hitler's. Japanese leaders seem to have believed Hitler's words and been hypnotized by him. Their chaotic finances and bad politics may push their people into an irreparable catastrophe, but this is not what they care about. Germany has already said it, and what Germany says must be true.</p>
<p>Wake Up Early to Avoid Being Reduced to Ruins</p>
<p>Recalling the great men who led to Japan's greatness decades ago, such as Ito, Okuma, and Saionji, although they had dreams of empire, they were not driven by vanity, nor did they blindly seek imperfect friends. Although they transformed a feudal country into a modern country in fifty years, they did not trap their country in reckless adventures, nor did they make calls to be surrounded. What they sent was the voice of Japan, so they could place Japan on a secure foundation. However, the temporarily dormant volcano still exists and has been erupting for the past decade. The flames are spraying out and not stopping, and the molten rock is flowing out, destroying everything. Will it sooner or later reach the point of no return? When it becomes calm again in the future, although the ground has cooled, what is buried beneath will eventually become eternal ruins. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Engages in Heated Debate on Lend-Lease Act; Government Spokesman Issues Warning; If Britain Is Defeated, the US Will Be Attacked from Both Sides</h3>
<p>Washington: Yesterday was the first of three days of debate on the Aid to Britain Bill. Government spokesmen warned the House that if Britain were defeated, Germany and Japan would simultaneously "attack" the United States. This prediction was made by Congressman Johnson of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Johnson is a high-ranking Democrat and a confidant of President Roosevelt. The situation during the debate was already tense, and Johnson's warning brought the tension to its highest point. The House unanimously agreed to end the general debate tomorrow night. Amendments will be discussed on Thursday, and the final vote is expected on Friday. House Speaker Rayburn predicted that it would get a majority of one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five votes. (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: The debate in the House of Representatives on the Lend-Lease Act has entered an intense stage. Congressman Jackson, a Republican from Illinois, demanded that the authorities explain the motives behind British Ambassador Halifax's recent visit to the House of Representatives. Jackson believed that the new British ambassador's move was "extraordinary" and stated that if the ambassador had anything to say, Congress should have the right to know. Chairman Bloom of the Foreign Affairs Committee stated, "Regarding Halifax's visit, there is only one 'extraordinary' move, and that is that it has actually aroused questions from the Congressman from Illinois. Congressman Cofilton, a Democrat from Washington, urged that the United States should "abide by the Monroe Doctrine" and should not provide various forms of assistance to Britain. He also demanded that the United States should strengthen the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Congressman Fish, a Republican from New York, is a major opponent of the Lend-Lease Act. He pointed out that this move was a prelude to launching a wartime law. Corfe "and others strongly argued that" once the bill is implemented, the United States will inevitably be in danger of being dragged into the European and Asian wars. Congressman Chalmers, a Democrat from Illinois and a government spokesman, stated that the United States should do its best to help Britain in order to strengthen its national defense and protect the Western Hemisphere. Yesterday was the first day of the House debate on the Lend-Lease Act. The debate was very intense. The government insisted that it was necessary for national defense, while opponents believed that the bill would lead the United States to dictatorship and war. Representative Rabon and other leaders from Texas are confident that the government has sufficient strength to defeat the Republican amendment, which aims to reduce the president's power. Bloom stated during the debate, "The passage of this bill is the best guarantee of our country's territory and freedom. Even if we do not provide assistance to Britain, the danger of war is greater than aiding Britain." Congressman Johnson, a Democrat from Texas, stated during the debate that Germany and Italy were "pressuring" Japan to take "offensive actions" against the United States, and said that if Britain collapsed, Japan would definitely launch an attack on the United States. "We will be attacked from both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans at the same time." (United Press International, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: Senator La Follette stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday that the Lend-Lease Act would give the power to decide whether the United States goes to war to one person. In March 1939, former French Prime Minister Daladier told him that France hoped that the United States would assist with financial resources, material resources, and manpower. Now this bill has stipulated financial resources and material resources. He dares to say that the US president will have reason to believe that this bill gives him the power to implement all the meanings of participation in the war. La Follette served as the governor of Wisconsin and organized the American Progressive Party in 1936. On the same day, Socialist Party leader Thomas also stated before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that after the bill is passed, US troops will definitely be sent to Europe, and the United States is in more danger of being drawn into the war. The United States wants to eliminate the power of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and it will inevitably use troops in Europe, Asia, or Africa. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington: A number of Republican leaders have drafted an alternative bill to the president's Aid to Britain Act, stipulating that Britain will be given credit to purchase goods worth US$1 trillion, and Britain will cede all of its territories in the Western Hemisphere except Canada to the United States. The initiator of this bill is Congressman Maas, a Republican from Minnesota, who can gain the support of the vast majority of Republicans and a part of the Democrats. Maas told United Press International reporters that this bill would allow Britain to obtain all the assistance it needs, but if Britain were defeated, the United States could guarantee that its national defense would not be threatened by enemies coming from neighboring islands.

<h3>Germany Establishes New Consulate in Manchouli</h3>
<p>Changchun: Germany has established a new consulate in Manchouli, presided over by Beckman, the former deputy consul in Yokohama. At the same time, the "Manchukuo government" also approved Germany to establish a consulate in Gegu Zi (transliteration). (Haitong News Agency, 4th)</p>
<h3>US Far East Expert Fuller Passes Away</h3>
<p>Washington: Fuller, the Deputy Chief of the Far Eastern Affairs Section of the US State Department and an expert on drug issues, passed away here on Sunday evening. Fuller had resided in the Far East for many years. He entered the diplomatic service in 1906, serving as Deputy Consul in Hong Kong. He subsequently served in Naples, Gothenburg, Iquitos, Durban, and Mexico. In 1915, he returned to the Far East as Consul General without a fixed location. From 1919 to 1923, he served as Consul General in Tianjin. He later joined the Far Eastern Affairs Section of the State Department in 1931. Fuller represented the United States at the 15th and 24th meetings of the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on Drug Traffic, and in 1936, he represented the United States in signing a public document on the embargo of drugs in Geneva. Fuller was born in Fort Worth, Keokuk, Iowa, on May 4, 1880. (United Press International, 4th)</p>

<h3>Grain 洋 Rice Hoarders Continue Their Mischief, But Fortunately Over 120,000 Bags of Rice Arrived Yesterday Alone, Discouraging Hoarders and Instantly Weakening Market Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a large amount of foreign rice arrived at the port. The Taigu Company's Taiyuan ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 3rd) in the late afternoon, carrying 5,000 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, which were unloaded yesterday. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship was supposed to arrive the day before yesterday (the 3rd), but was delayed until yesterday morning. It arrived with 18,481 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, Jardine Matheson's Yusheng, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, arrived earlier yesterday evening, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf. It also carried foreign rice, but the exact amount was not known due to the late arrival of the ship. We will investigate and report further today. The French ship Gouyerneur General A. Varenne (named Huali), managed by the Norwegian Chinese merchant Hua Lun Yanghang, directly carried 3,100 tons of foreign rice from Saigon to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 26th of last month, but it had not arrived by the end of the month, and only entered the port yesterday morning, carrying over 32,000 bags of foreign rice. It docked at the Qichang warehouse in Pudong for unloading. In addition, the Yongzhen (St. Vincent de Paul, French nationality) ship, managed by the French merchant Xia Laochen Yanghang, also carried over 17,000 bags of foreign rice from Saigon and arrived yesterday morning, docking at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. In addition, the Deda ship, also managed by Hua, directly transported 54,889 bags of foreign rice from Saigon and arrived yesterday morning, docking at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, a total of 127,374 bags arrived. (Zu)</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice arrived continuously, but the market reacted with positive sentiment and active hoarding. Both spot and futures prices continued to rise. Fortunately, actual spot sales have decreased, and the evaluated new offers have been lowered, so the market rose by about one yuan. However, the best and medium-quality goods have also reached their limit, and exceptionally high qualities are sometimes reluctantly withheld from sale. In the mid-market, because the prices have risen sufficiently, the willingness to absorb goods from both local stores and other merchants has noticeably weakened, and the upward trend has been curbed. Furthermore, due to the congestion of goods in the market, even a slight decline in sales will make it difficult for the market to sustain itself, and changes will occur immediately, gradually softening. Therefore, closing prices are more mixed. For example, No. 1 Saigon opened at 85 yuan and later settled at 83-84 yuan, No. 2 at 80 yuan to 77.8 yuan, No. 1 Siam from 85 yuan to 82-83 yuan, No. 2 at 78.5 yuan. In particular, fire-milled rice was the most abundant in the market, and with poor sales, it could only conservatively maintain the original price of 81-82 yuan. Only small-grain rice continued to be actively traded, increasing by about half a yuan. High-quality broken tips were also in demand due to their scarcity, rising by nearly one yuan, opening at 67 yuan or 66.5 yuan, and closing at 62-63 yuan. Re-bagging was most active at Yinghua, with a total turnover of no less than 1,400 tons throughout the day. February No. 1 Saigon was 94 yuan, No. 2 Saigon 91 yuan, small-grain spot 89 yuan to 88.5 yuan, January 16 at 88.5 yuan, January 15 delivery at 87 yuan, February Jianyuan rose from 86.5 yuan to 87.9 yuan, and Dafu February rose from 86.5 yuan to 87.6 yuan, one to two yuan higher than the previous market. In the new transactions, Nanqiao Company sold 500 tons of February No. 1 Saigon at a price of 93.7 yuan.</p>
<p>Various national rices such as thick and thin japonica rice arrive sporadically and continuously, but shops are reluctant to absorb them because national rice has become a luxury item, and most merchants mainly use foreign rice. With limited sales, although foreign rice continues to have a good appearance, it is difficult to compete with it, and the selling price can only hold the original price, similar to before. Regular special white japonica is still 107-108 yuan, and by measure is 102-103 yuan. Kunshan original white japonica is 104-105 yuan, and by measure is 100-97 yuan. Qingjiao by measure of thin rice is 95-96 yuan, and the original bag is 98-99 yuan.</p>
<p>Although there is not much glutinous rice on the market, sales declined yesterday, resulting in a lackluster market with no gains or losses. Hong Kong special white glutinous rice still opens at 78-79 yuan, and the middle closing is 76-77 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Sales Remain Active</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the flour market continued to prosper. It was found that the Chinese factory's discounted flour was still 23 yuan, with 6,000 bags plus a few more supplied by the Fu and Fu factories, limited to retail sales on Mu Street. Therefore, in terms of customer sales, we can only rely on foreign flour. In addition, there were rumors of delays in the shipment of foreign flour to Shanghai, and everyone was hoping for a good market. The overall market opened with five thousand plus bags of Clock Tower and Bird &amp; Flower brand Australian flour at a price of 24.9 yuan, and the bank's stock was 25 yuan, with an additional 0.1 yuan. Blue Mark Flower brand was 24.65 yuan, and Wild Boar and Beauty brands were two to three jiao higher than Clock Tower and Bird &amp; Flower brands. At present, the supply from Hong Kong is constant, and the price of rice is reduced by one yuan, so the market is difficult to consolidate.</p>
<p>Wheat: The producing areas are exhausted and Shanghai's reserves are meager. All factories are waiting for foreign wheat to be supplied. They have little interest in domestic wheat, and only the Japanese factories have slightly increased their purchases, with the price still around 23 yuan. Market prices are frequently high, but there is no formal trading.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Bean Cake Used as a Football - The Market Situation Becomes Chaotic</h3>
<p>Recently, the oil cake market, because there is no opportunity to take advantage of the oil market, and there is no way to manipulate it, the general speculators who grab hats have changed their course and unanimously poured into bean cakes. The flat, round bean cake is used as a football to play with, kicking back and forth, causing the market to be chaotic. The price rises and falls unpredictably in one day, and the result is still to raise the corner code spectrum. The current cake of Ji Xing is 10,000 pieces, and the price is 15 yuan. More than 30,000 pieces are ordered for delivery in the upper part of March, and the price is from 15.25 yuan to 4 jiao, and then 15.35 yuan. The current cake of Fei Zi is 10 carts, and the price is from 15.3 jiao to 4 jiao. The current cake of Li Zi is 1,000 pieces, and the price is 15 yuan. 3,000 pieces are ordered for delivery in the lower part of February, and the price is 5 yuan and 1 jiao above. More than 10 carts of Yuanlong cake are delivered in the upper part of March, and the price is from 15.55 jiao to 4 jiao. More than 8,000 pieces of Yuanji cake are delivered in the lower part of February, and the price is 15 yuan, and from 15.05 yuan to 15.15 yuan in the upper part of March. 1,360 bags of soybeans were exported on the 5th and transported to Xiamen, and 955 bags were transported to Hong Kong. 2,000 pieces of bean cake were transported to Xiamen, and 7,240 pieces were transported to Hong Kong. 2,510 cans of raw oil were transported to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diaoging Rises by Three Yuan, Granulated Sugar Arrives with Over 9,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a softening trend due to sluggish actual sales and some floating merchants selling off. The association's prices were: spot No. 24 coarse white sugar at the warehouse was 82 yuan and 0.5 jiao, and at outside warehouses 81 yuan to 81.2 yuan and 0.4 jiao. For the 10th of February, the price was 81.4 jiao to 6 jiao and 0.2 jiao. For the 20th of February, the price was 81.8 jiao and 0.2 jiao. For the end of this month, the price was 81.8 jiao to 82 yuan and 0.1 jiao. Dutch cotton white secondary color was 78 yuan, BS mark was 79.5 yuan, and Dutch red was 65.5 yuan and a small sum. Taigu Che Yue B mark was 81.5 jiao to 6 jiao and 0.2 jiao, DY mark was 78.6 jiao, and HX mark was 78.4 jiao, with the same degree of reduction. The price of new Diaoging domestic sugar rose by 3 yuan to 67 yuan, as the production price was difficult to determine and there was a lack of arrivals, but there was inventory of old goods. The price of Dongxiang red sugar was still 58 yuan.</p>
<p>A large amount of granulated sugar arrived in Shanghai. The Taigu Taiyuan ship arrived the day before yesterday, carrying 9,450 bags of granulated sugar from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods Golden Vegetables Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Golden needle vegetables continue to rise as arrivals are insufficient, and there is stronger interest among brokers. The price of goods opened the day before yesterday at 126 yuan, and was 140 yuan yesterday, a rise of more than ten yuan. The Xiangzi brand vegetables also rose to 150 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Native Silk Decorates the Silk Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's overseas silk market saw no activity in New York, while Yokohama was uniformly bullish. The spot price opened at 1,385 yuan, continuing the rise of 15 yuan from the day before. February futures were 1,394 yuan, also up 14 yuan. July futures were 1,400 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan.</p>
<p>The local silk market remains sluggish. Yesterday, only white native silk was traded.</p>
<h3>Finance Chinese Merchants Continuously Sending Out Foreign Exchange, Foreign Banks' Intake Finally Sees Tightening</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's quoted prices. The black market for British and American exchanges was unstable. This was because the rumors had dissipated and speculators were reselling, resulting in more ample positions. However, foreign banks' appetite remained strong. In particular, a certain American bank was purchasing in the afternoon, accepting the American exchange sold by speculators without refusal. The majority of transactions throughout the day were for American exchange at between 5.3125 yuan and 5.28125 yuan. It firmed up at midday, with a rate of 5.34375 yuan. At the close, American exchange was flat and British exchange was tight at 0.015625, with American exchange at 5.3125 yuan and British exchange at 3 shillings 32.8125 pence.</p>
<p>Morning Market Trend Relaxed</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, London's big bars rose by 0.0625 for both near-term and long-term contracts. The price of silver in New York remained bullish, and the price of gold in London was stable. The exchange rate against the US dollar was unchanged, but it was 0.0125 yuan higher against Shanghai. The US dollar to British pound rate did not change, but the rate against Shanghai was 0.07 yuan lower. There was no market for the French franc. The central bank's quoted rates for all exchanges remained the same. Banks' morning opening prices for spot goods were 3 shillings 34.375 pence for British gold and 5.34375 yuan for American exchange, which was higher than the previous day's closing price. British exchange was flat and American exchange was firm by 0.03125 yuan. After the opening, the market calmed down. Speculators first intended to buy, settling American exchange for this month with a certain American bank at 5.3125 yuan. At 9:30, HSBC's listed prices were announced and remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax increased by 0.25%. At this time, Chinese merchant banks sought to sell, and Chinese merchant speculators also followed suit, selling American exchange for this month to foreign banks at 5.3125 yuan. However, the price for American exchange for the next month was 5.28125 yuan. Subsequently, because Chinese merchant speculators continued to sell American exchange quite eagerly, the underlying trend relaxed. The brokerage firms and brokers purchased American exchange for this month at 5.34375 yuan. The noon closing was also stable, with spot British gold at 3 shillings 34.375 pence and American exchange at 5.34375 yuan, similar to the morning opening price.</p>
<p>American Bank's Strong Interest</p>
<p>In the afternoon, speculators first came to sell American exchange for this month. Initially, a certain American bank absorbed it at a price of 5.3125 yuan, but the bank's appetite was unusually strong, leading to a softening of the underlying trend. The evening closing prices for spot and this month's British gold were 3 shillings 32.8125 pence, and American exchange was 5.3125 yuan. The next month's prices were 3 shillings 29.6875 pence for British gold and 5.28125 yuan for American exchange, which was 0.015625 yuan lower for spot British exchange and flat for American exchange compared to yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Rates Unchanged</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 4th (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. There were no changes in the American, British, and Japanese exchange rates. The spot rate for Shanghai exchange fell by 0.5 yuan to 445 yuan (yesterday's closing was 445.5 yuan). At 11:30, it was reported flat, with no changes in any exchange rates. The market opened flat at 2:30 PM, with the spot rate for Shanghai exchange recovering by 1.5 yuan to 446.5 yuan. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>British and American Currencies Tight in Tianjin</p>
<p>Tianjin, 4th (Tuesday) telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London and New York telegraphic transfer rates were each tighter by 0.03125. London was at 3 pence 6875, and New York was at 5.875 yuan. Shanghai exchange rose by 5 yuan to 91 yuan. The unofficial rate for "Joint Notes" rose by 0.62 yuan to 79.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculation Concentrated on Cotton Yarn, Gold Market Begins to Feel Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw gold black market experienced slight fluctuations, with prices still fluctuating around the 6,700 yuan mark. This was because the foreign exchange market stabilized, and speculators concentrated their efforts on manipulating the spot yarn market, leading to a sudden weakening of the gold market. The atmosphere was quite stable on all sides, because the foreign exchange market quickly returned to level after fluctuating. General exchange dealers were constantly selling, so the morning opening rose to 6,750 yuan, then immediately retreated to 6,680 yuan. Tianyuan increased its position, slightly rebounding at midday. Fluctuations of more than ten yuan occurred in the afternoon, and the market closed at 2:45 PM at 6,700 yuan, a slight decrease of 5 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange market reported a soft tone after the close, so the off-market price rose to 6,730 yuan. Total trading volume was about 3,000 taels. Initially, Xinyili sold 10 taels to Defu in cash, with a premium of 40 yuan for delivery on schedule. Later, Baokang bought 130 taels from Yongfeng, also with a premium of 40 yuan. At midday, Xinyili suddenly re-sold 200 taels to Defu, with a premium of 50 yuan. In the afternoon, Defu again bought 130 taels from Yongfengyu and Yongfeng, with a premium of 45 yuan. Ornaments, Customs Gold, etc. remained flat.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Only Down Slightly by 5 Yuan</p>
<p>Continuing the firm tone after yesterday's close at the start of the morning, there were again reports that the foreign exchange market opened with a soft tone, and February American gold at 5.3125 yuan was difficult to settle. Bidding was enthusiastic at the counter, and the opening price soared to 6,750 yuan. However, it was difficult to maintain the high price because exchange dealers immediately entered the market to sell aggressively. Chengji, Hesheng, Dafeng, etc. supplied goods enthusiastically, and the price was pushed down to the 6,700 yuan mark, eventually falling to 6,680 yuan. However, silver firms at this time maintained their position well, buying a large number of goods at low prices. Tianyuan, Xinyili, and others all dragged in, gradually rising to just outside the 6,700 yuan mark, reaching 6,712 yuan. However, the exchange market returned to level from soft, and exchange dealers again started selling. They had previously bought in to cover their short positions, so the fall was very slight, retreating to just inside the 6,700 yuan mark, closing at 6,690 yuan. The market was quieter at midday, and there was still a lot of retail demand at the counter, settling at 6,700 yuan at the close. The opening was even quieter in the afternoon, with the price still at 6,700 yuan. For a while, the cash firms Shishi and exchange dealer Xinfeng slightly sold, retreating to 6,696 yuan. Later, Da and Fu, as well as some small money shops, slightly absorbed, and the price rose again, reaching 6,708 yuan, which was the high price for the afternoon. Because the silver firm Xiangxing was the only one selling, the price returned to 6,700 yuan, which was the evening closing price, around 2:45 PM. This was down 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The off-market was better after the close, trading around 6,720-30 yuan. The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than raw gold, while the purchase price was thirty yuan lower. The current standard gold was five to six ten yuan lower than the listed gold, but there was little trading.</p>
<p>Ornaments Still Unchanged</p>
<p>The price of gold for jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged from morning to night. Datonghang still hung 690 yuan, and the prices at Xintonghang were similar to the above, with a purchase price that was thirty yuan lower.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Notes Still in Strong Demand</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency situation: the raw gold market price rose and then fell, but it trended upward again after the new opening, so the British and American gold pounds also rose by 0.5 jiao each. The British gold note was stable and unchanged, and the market price was flat. The American gold note once rose to 18.65 yuan in the afternoon, but eventually settled at 18.6 yuan, an increase of 0.12 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes remained in strong demand, and the market price continued to rise. The rising trend of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes did not stop. The former rose to 1.62 yuan, and the latter rose to 1.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower Double Horse Sees New Price Again, Rumors that Factory Orders Continue to Open at 2,000 Bales</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be strong, and the rising trend is still strong, so new highs continue to be set. This is because the price of fine cloth is expensive, which has aroused the activity of new buyers. At the same time, the actual demand is still not weak. However, most of the yarn bought by customers is 32-count fine yarn, followed by 23-count yarn, which is also not bad. However, the speculators are unusually excited. A major player in the securities industry turned from short to long. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,529 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,503 yuan. In the afternoon, it began to trade at 1,530 yuan, then fell to 1,515 yuan, and the final price was 1,522 yuan. It is rumored that Shenxin Factory of Double Horse has opened another 2,000 bales. It remains to be verified. Therefore, the sentiment has softened slightly. Today, there were five pieces of cotton yarn transported to Xiamen and 255 pieces transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening of Double Horse: Because the sentiment was very good in the afternoon of the previous day, it continued to move forward. The first opening price was 1,506 yuan, but buyers came one after another. Under these circumstances, the market gradually rose to 1,519 yuan. At this time, those who were profitable came out to sell, and at the same time, it was heard that the price of gold had fallen back, gradually falling to 1,503 yuan. When the low price appeared at the counter, there were quite a few people who bought in to become temporary bulls. Near the close, when the chips were exhausted, the buying frenzy rose suddenly, rising to 1,528 yuan at the close. The statistics of transactions in the first half of the day show that 7,700 bales were traded. The amounts bought by each gang are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 7,100 Hong Kong 600</p>
<p>Total 7,700</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Prospering</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is trending firmer. General speculators are buying and selling each other, rising with the yarn market. At the same time, Chinese factories Xinhuo, Zhongfang, Shenxin Nos. 2 and 9, Xinsheng Factory, and Datong Yarn Factory all have considerable needs. Therefore, the market is prospering and sentiment is boosted. However, overseas purchases are still cheaper. Profit of dozens of yuan per picul could be made when cotton arrives to Shanghai. Therefore, overseas orders have been unusually active recently.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose initially due to purchases by fellow traders, then fell later due to the selling of southern gangs and the closing of long positions. The result was about 1-2 pounds lower compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>Indian cotton also fell due to cotton merchants selling, long positions taking profits, and continuous selling by a small number of speculators. Yesterday, the prediction was lowered by three and a half rupees.</p>
<p>The only reason for the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai is that the market lacks chips and the factories are eager for goods. Therefore, the activity of transactions in recent days has reached a fever pitch. As for the soaring prices of long-staple wool products, it is even more unexpected. Yesterday, high-grade middling used as raw material for 42-count cotton reached a high price of 385 yuan per picul. However, there were still many people competing to buy it.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Soars, Taking Profits and Reselling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the factory cloth market hovered, and the morale was slightly relaxed. After several days of soaring prices, floating longs took profits and resold. However, the actual demand was still strong, so the selling was as firm as ever. The price of some white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill rose slightly by 0.2-0.5 yuan per piece. The price of bleached and dyed cloth also rose by 0.3-0.5 yuan. The price of this month's futures was about 0.5 yuan higher than the spot price. Nearly a thousand pieces of grey cloth and bleached and dyed cloth were traded on this street. The Wenzhou and Ningbo gangs on the Zhejiang Road traded more than a hundred pieces of colored cloth, poplin, and bleached cloth. The Fujian and Macau gangs traded more than 400 pieces of poplin, blue cloth, colored twill, and coarse and fine cloth. Merchants from other countries such as Singapore traded more than 2,000 pieces of khaki bleached cloth. 350 pieces of piece goods were transported to Hong Kong and 30 pieces were transported to Xiamen on the 5th.</p>
<p>The spot market for East cloth rose and then fell. As a result, the fine cloth still continued to rise by 0.5-1 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 52.4-5 yuan and fell to around 51 yuan at the close. However, the off-market was again tight, selling at 51.3-4 yuan. The futures at the exchange all fell at the noon close. In the afternoon, the market sentiment turned bullish, but on average, each month was down by 0.5-1.9 yuan. The closing market prices are as follows:</p>
<p>February 52.01 yuan</p>
<p>March 53.55 yuan</p>
<p>April 55.01 yuan</p>
<p>May 55.30 yuan</p>
<h3>Securities Public Debt Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The black market for public debt continued to be weak yesterday, with no signs of recovery. The negative rumors in the market have not yet subsided. Yuxing, Xinfu, Dahua, and others continue to have spot goods flowing out. Class C opened at 66 yuan and then continued to fall to 5.2 yuan, a fall of more than 1 yuan. Hongda and Lianyi slightly made up for their short positions at the counter, rising by 0.3-0.4 yuan. However, Runli, Yizhong, Renchang, and others continued to supply more chips, falling back by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Shengda, Xie Kang bought in to cover short positions, and then recovered by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The market situation was erratic. It can be seen that major players have extremely ample chips. Observing the market situation, major players are selling a considerable amount every day. They are afraid of squeezing the market price too low if they sell everything at once. Therefore, the future is probably not good yet. As a result, it continued to fall by 0.3-0.8 yuan. Only No. 96 was up by 0.25 yuan. The transaction volume was about 2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>The trading of stocks: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded, with a price of 9 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Monday) telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks were all flat and stagnant, and the market was generally unchanged.</p>
<h3>Seafood All Goods Open Red, All Rose</h3>
<p>Since the closure of the settlement period, the opening red of seafood is at the end on schedule, as recently opened in each market with no fall and no retreat compared to last year. The volume of transactions in each area is also robust and stable.</p>
<p>(Mingyu) Sea Cucumber: Top Bald 580 yuan, Large 600 yuan to 560 yuan, Large-Mid 500 yuan, Mid-Bald 400 yuan · 380 yuan · 360 yuan, Small Bald 300 yuan to 280 yuan, Yellow Skin Jade Sea Cucumber Ludat 406 yuan, No. 1, 350 yuan, No. 2 no goods, No. 3, 306 yuan, No. 4, 276 yuan, Mid 220 yuan, (Dried Mussels) Departing Office 245 yuan, Large Mussels 235 yuan, Mid Mussels 220 yuan to 210 yuan, Small Mussels 200 yuan to 195 yuan (Sea Moss) Lion Mane 74 yuan, Flushed Lion Mane 70 yuan to 68 yuan, Dragon Sprout 58 yuan to 57 yuan, Wu Jiao 68 yuan to 59 yuan, (Tapioca Starch) Flying Unicorn Label 108 yuan, KG 102 yuan, Double TA 77 yuan, Double T 60 yuan, (Shrimp Tails) Xiangshan 420 yuan to 390 yuan, Tanabe Tails 440 yuan, (Western Fennel) 298 yuan, (Fujian Fragrant Mushrooms) 600 yuan, 580 yuan, Thick Mushrooms 700 yuan, 650 yuan, (Pepper) Black Large Pepper 125 yuan, 120 yuan, White Pepper 230 yuan, 215 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Indian Coal Returns to Original Price</h3>
<p>Indian bituminous coal, the red opening saw once a virtual peak of 250 yuan, then through verified, the market was 245 yuan, according to the original plate only added 5 yuan, since recently the sales are limited, retail take advantage of the high to stock the goods, regrettably there are no buyers, it is also in vain, and so it reversed after the rise and back to the original, but back to the original 240 yuan, and has a dark panel, so the bituminous coal rose as a flash in the pan and returned to its former state said.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials Ginseng and Fungus Rise Again, White Bird's Nest Remains Level</h3>
<p>Ginseng, bird's nest, and silver fungus have repeatedly risen in price due to the obstructed supply routes. Those with sufficient inventory last year had considerable surpluses, each earning 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. This year's red market opening has once again led to higher prices. However, the price increase of American ginseng is the highest, with some rising 40 to 50 yuan per catty. The market prices are listed below: American Ginseng Zheng Grade 440 yuan, 200 Grade 270 yuan, No. 1 Powdered Light 280 yuan, No. 2 Powdered Light 250 yuan, No. 3, 230 yuan, No. 4, 220 yuan, Wild Mountain Top Light 140 yuan, Seed Top Light 120 yuan. The rise in American ginseng is due to the added 20% on American exchange, Hong Kong exchange, and shipping costs. Although Sichuan silver fungus is now arriving, all businesses are optimistic about the price increase, so its price is also rising. Top-grade 210 yuan, Middle-grade 180 yuan, Low-grade 120 yuan. White bird's nest has not risen in price due to sluggish sales. Top-grade 110 yuan, Middle-grade 90 yuan, Low-grade 88 yuan. Because of the sale of Korean ginseng to Hong Kong, the tariff has increased, making large branches more sluggish. Heaven 15 branches 460 yuan, Heaven 20 branches 380 yuan. The above can be raised by 40 yuan. Heaven 30 branches 340 yuan, Heaven 40 branches 310 yuan. Small branches can be sold in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, raised 20 yuan per plate. Earth 15 branches 20 branches 350 yuan, can be raised by 25 yuan per plate. Earth 30 branches 320 yuan, 40 branches 290 yuan, 50 branches 260 yuan, can be raised by 20 yuan per plate.

<h3>Under Tight Security, the Taxpayers' Meeting Reopens Today; Western Attendees Expected to Be Numerous; Proposal for Increased Donations Expected to Pass Smoothly; Protest Lodged Regarding Arson Incident</h3>
<p>The special meeting of Western taxpayers of the Public Concession convened on the 23rd of last month was adjourned after Lin Xiongji, opposing the second item on the agenda, the Municipal Council's proposal to "discuss increasing land tax and municipal general donations and special surcharges," delivered a speech, and the Chairman of the Municipal Council, K.S. Cornabe, also addressed the meeting in rebuttal. Subsequently, just as a vote was about to be taken on the amendment proposed by Lin, Lin Xiongji opened fire and shot at Cornabe, injuring several people, and the meeting was adjourned. Senior Consul Heill has now scheduled a reconvening for 2:30 PM today at the original location, the grandstand of the racetrack at 345 Jing'an Temple Road. He has solemnly declared that regardless of the weather, the meeting will not be postponed. Therefore, today's meeting is a continuation of the previous one, and the Japanese amendment will be discussed first. Regarding the question of whether the Japanese will attend, they have previously expressed their position. However, yesterday, rumors spread among foreigners that some Japanese would attend. However, Japanese newspapers indicated that they would oppose the passage of the Municipal Council's donation increase plan by refusing to attend, suggesting there would be no change in their position. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Thorough Security to Prevent Disputes</p>
<p>According to police officials, strict security measures will be taken when the special taxpayers' meeting is held this afternoon. However, the Concession authorities declined to disclose the specific security measures to be taken at today's meeting. It is known that steel plates have been placed around the platform. Another report stated that police authorities claimed yesterday that all possible security measures would be taken at today's meeting, ensuring that disputes would not be repeated.</p>
<p>Three Items on the Meeting Agenda</p>
<p>Today's meeting will continue the agenda that was unfinished at the last meeting. The second item has two amendments: One proposed by Lin Xiongji and seconded by Futian suggests that the Municipal Council withdraw the donation increase proposal, temporarily borrow money to make up for the budget deficit, continue to implement government downsizing, and fundamentally study and reform the current tax system to create a fairer one for adoption. The other, proposed by Liddell and seconded by Arlington, requests a temporary increase of 40% in land tax for self-owned properties that have not been revalued since 1937. The third item is a discussion of the revised license fee proposal proposed by Liddell and seconded by Magnuson, requesting the abolition of the increased license fee for dairies. According to the Municipal Council's proposal, the annual license fee for each cow in "A" and "B" grade dairies would be 15 yuan, and for "A(T.T.)" grade cows, the annual fee would be 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Estimated 9,000 Attendees</p>
<p>Since this meeting continues from where the last one was interrupted, a quorum is not required, as stated by the Municipal Council. According to the Council, the total number of eligible votes for foreign taxpayers in the city is over 18,000, with the Japanese accounting for less than half. British, American, and other nationalities account for approximately 10,000. The last meeting was attended by over 4,500 taxpayers, with the Japanese accounting for one-third. It is expected that the reopening of today's meeting will see an increase in non-Japanese taxpayers due to the stimulation of the Japanese actions and the encouragement of Western media, with the total number of attendees reaching over 9,000.</p>
<p>Swift Passage Expected</p>
<p>Well-informed sources predicted yesterday that due to the absence of Japanese residents who oppose the proposal, it is expected to pass quickly at today's meeting. A senior Japanese official claimed yesterday that he had not received official reports on whether Japanese taxpayers would adhere to their original stance of non-participation, but stated, "As far as I know, the Japanese will not participate in this meeting." Municipal Council officials have previously stated that this meeting is merely a continuation of the last one, and therefore, no quorum is necessary.</p>
<p>Some Japanese Will Still Attend</p>
<p>According to the English-language *North China Daily News*, the Japanese Taxpayers' Association has officially resolved that Japanese will not participate in today's (5th) special meeting of foreign taxpayers. However, Japanese residents in the city stated yesterday (4th) morning, "Some Japanese will still attend," and added, "Japanese taxpayers are still strongly opposed to the Municipal Council's proposed increases in taxes and license fees." They did not indicate what steps the Japanese would take to prevent the passage of the donation increase resolution.</p>
<p>Voting on Japanese Proposal</p>
<p>It is heard that at the beginning of today's special meeting, a vote will be taken on the Japanese amendment opposing the donation increase (this proposal was rejected by a show of hands at the special meeting on January 23). After the vote, the special meeting will continue with the remaining agenda, discussing two other amendments that suggest revaluing the value of self-owned properties and no longer taxing dairies in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Protest Lodged Regarding Arson at the Venue</p>
<p>Regarding the incident the day before yesterday (morning) when two Japanese attempted to set fire to the reed shed erected by the Municipal Council at the racetrack for the special meeting of foreign taxpayers, the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai has received a protest from the Municipal Council and is currently investigating it. Yesterday morning, Japanese officials refused to comment on the arson incident involving the two Japanese.</p>
<p>Japanese Police to Participate in Security</p>
<p>The Public Concession police authorities stated that they will take strict security measures during today's special meeting of foreign taxpayers at the racetrack. They did not disclose the specific measures, but it is understood that in addition to taking several special steps, they will also dispatch more Japanese police to guard the premises.</p>

The ceremony will be held at 5:30 PM on February 6 at the Greek Orthodox Cathedral on Rue Henri in the French Concession. The Greek Consul General in Shanghai, Yannoulatos, will attend.</p>
<h3>French Women Respond to the Free French</h3>
<p>Organizing the Lorraine Cross Association to Engage in Fundraising and Other Activities</p>
<p>According to the *Shanghai Mercury*, after France's armistice with Germany, General de Gaulle, leader of the pro-war faction, led the Free French forces to continue the resistance, using the famous "Lorraine Cross" as their emblem and "France Forever" as their slogan. Free French citizens throughout the Far East have responded enthusiastically, engaging in various patriotic activities. General de Gaulle recently appealed from London to Free French citizens to provide manpower and material resources to resist Germany, with excellent results. The response from Free French citizens in Shanghai has been particularly enthusiastic. When France announced the armistice, the Veterans Association of French Soldiers who had participated in the war sent a telegram to the Petain government, expressing their willingness to continue fighting. Subsequently, many French citizens in Shanghai participated in the de Gaulle movement. French women, patriotic and not to be outdone by men, have organized a women's group initiated by Madame Leonard, called the "Lorraine Cross Association," to engage in fundraising and other activities. They have sent 3,000 woolen sweaters, 100,000 boxes of cigarettes, and 1,000 yuan in Christmas慰勞金 to the Free French forces stationed in London. Three American women are members of the Lorraine Cross Association.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador to Visit Beiping</h3>
<p>According to a Havas news agency dispatch from Shanghai, the French Ambassador to China, Cosme, arrived here on the 1st of this month and intends to stay here for several days to handle routine official business, before proceeding to Beiping. After arriving in Beiping, Counselor Pengu of the embassy will then go to Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Thanks Flour Mills</h3>
<p>Fufeng and Fuxin Flour Mills Praised for Selling Flour at Stable Prices for the Benefit of Genuine Users</p>
<p>Last year, Fufeng and Fuxin Flour Mills, at the request of the Concession authorities, sold flour at stable prices throughout the year, greatly benefiting genuine users. The Municipal Council recently sent letters to the general managers of both mills, expressing its appreciation and hoping that they would continue to serve the community and sell flour at stable prices.</p>
<p>Regarding the sale of flour at stable prices, the Municipal Council and Fuxin and Fufeng Mills have agreed that, starting from the 3rd of this month, Fuxin will supply 5,873 bags daily, and Fufeng will supply 1,059 bags, except on Sundays. Each bag will cost 33 yuan from the factory, plus a handling fee of 30 cents. However, as the supply is slightly insufficient, users are only allowed to collect flour on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. (No flour will be distributed on Wednesday and Sunday). This information has been reported. It is known that Fufeng distributed 1,059 bags daily on January 31st and February 1st, and Fuxin distributed 5,000 bags daily, totaling 12,118 bags. These bags have not yet been sold. Therefore, an extra day of distribution will be added this Wednesday. As for the remaining 3,800 bags after the extra day of distribution, it is proposed that when the 7% allocation of foreign flour (of a quality similar to No. 2 flour in this street) reaches 4,518 bags, the two quantities will be combined to reach 8,318 bags, and another day of distribution will be added next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Difficult Navigation Between Zhejiang and Fujian; "Minhe" Still Detained</h3>
<p>"Xin'anli" and Other Merchant Vessels Have No Connection to "Minhe"</p>
<p>After the Japanese navy announced a blockade of the Zhejiang and Fujian coastlines in mid-July last year, ships such as *Xinxiangtai*, *Daxin*, *Haifu*, *Moufu*, and *Baoli* were detained by Japanese warships in Zhejiang waters and escorted to Zhoushan for surveillance. The longest detention was of *Xinxiangtai* lasting more than four months. They began to be released one after another at the end of last year and returned to Shanghai. Japanese warships search the sea rigorously, making navigation difficult. Therefore, the released vessels and other ships suspended sailing to pass the Spring Festival. After the holiday, they had to risk sailing for business purposes, but current freight volumes are light, expenses are high, and charter rates have doubled, causing merchants to suffer immensely. As for the Portuguese ship *Minhe*, it was detained by local troops in Fuqing at the beginning of last month and has not yet been released. The *Xin'anli* and *Xin'anna* two Ma-Le ships are purely merchant vessels operating under a lease and have no connection with the ship *Minhe*. Moreover, the nationality of each ship is different, and there is no question of cooperation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Special Police Force Expected to Be Established Soon; Bureau to Appoint Pan Da as Chief Director; All Illegal Locations in "Badlands" to Be Sealed Off</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *North China Daily News*, the establishment of the Shanghai West United District Special Police Force is expected to be completed within the next three weeks. Reliable sources reveal that the Municipal Council is currently selecting senior officers for the Special Police Force. Pan Da (transliteration) will be appointed as Chief Director, Inspector Hall as Deputy Chief Director, Inspector Kresot in charge of the Detective Squad, and Inspector Zhang Bolan as Liaison Officer. In addition, the names of Chinese and Japanese officers appointed by the Municipal Council to the Special Police Force were not available yesterday (4th) morning.</p>
<p>Pan Da Familiar with Police Work</p>
<p>Pan Da's appointment as head of the United District Special Police Force was designated by the former "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an last year. Last year, when the "Cross-Boundary Roads Agreement" was expected to be implemented, Shen Da set up a general office at 34 Yidingpan Road. His cousin, Pan Zhiquan, a comprador with Jardine Matheson, who was kidnapped in the French Concession three weeks ago, remains missing. Pan Da has served as Deputy Chief of the Special Police Squad of the Municipal Council Police Department for approximately nine years and has considerable experience in Shanghai's police work. When traveling on the streets, he is always protected by bodyguards in two cars in front and behind the car he is riding in.</p>
<p>Continuing Discussions on Establishment Details</p>
<p>It is also heard that Municipal Council Police Chief Major Bowen and "Municipal Police Chief" Lu Ying will meet at the end of this week to discuss the details of the establishment of the Special Police Force. The two main points are the selection of other personnel for the Special Police Force and the establishment of police stations. Officials have announced that after the new police force is established, it will seal off all gambling dens and other illegal locations in the "badlands," regardless of whether they are established by foreigners or Chinese.</p>
<h3>*President Monroe* Makes Maiden Voyage to Shanghai; Shanghai-Vietnam Route Open; Due to Extraordinary Circumstances, No Tours Will Be Offered; Ships Sailing to the South Seas Operate as Usual</h3>
<p>The American President Lines has built six new world-class liners. The first ship, *President Jackson*, made its maiden voyage to Shanghai on December 11th last year. It stayed in Shanghai overnight and left for the South Seas the next day (December 12th), returning to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope. It is estimated to have arrived in New York on the 2nd of this month and returned to Boston on the 3rd.</p>
<p>*President Monroe* Scheduled to Berth Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The second new ship, *President Monroe*, was launched from the same dock in Newport News on August 17th last year. It departed from Boston on December 24th last year for its maiden voyage to the East. It passed Kobe yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (6th) at 10:00 AM (delayed by one day from the scheduled voyage), berthed at buoys 12 and 13. Passengers will board the company's small boat and disembark at the Customs pier between 11:30 AM and noon tomorrow. After staying in Shanghai overnight, it will set sail for Hong Kong, Luzon, and various South Seas ports at 5:00 AM on the 7th, returning to Boston. The last small passenger boat will depart from the Customs pier at 1:00 AM on the 7th (midnight on the 6th). As it is curfew time, passengers may board an earlier boat, departing from the Customs pier at 9:00 PM on the 6th.</p>
<p>No Tours Allowed Due to Extraordinary Circumstances</p>
<p>The new liner's tonnage, speed, style, and equipment are the same as those of the *President Jackson*, and can be called sister ships. The company originally planned to host tours for various sectors of society upon its arrival, but due to the current extraordinary circumstances, it has been cancelled. Four more new ships are currently under construction. Also, the company's *President Coolidge*, a Pacific Liner returning from Luzon via Hong Kong, has also been delayed by one day and will arrive in Shanghai on the 8th and depart on the 9th, returning to the United States. The exact arrival time will be known when the ship sends a telegram.</p>
<p>French Ships Between Shanghai and Vietnam Operate on Schedule</p>
<p>There are rumors that the Japanese naval authorities will deploy ships to blockade the South China Sea and prevent foreign merchant ships from approaching, and that the transportation of cargo ships between Shanghai and Vietnam operated by the French Messageries Maritimes Company will also be blocked. According to a *Ping Ming News Agency* reporter's interview with the French Messageries Maritimes Company yesterday, the company's cargo ships *Kienting* and *Lothringen* recently sailed from Shanghai to Vietnam with cargo and have arrived in Haiphong and Saigon. The *D'Artagnan* has unloaded the prohibited food supplies in Shanghai and is scheduled to depart for Kobe, Japan on the morning of the 6th of this month. After returning to Shanghai, it will return south on a regular schedule. The *Bougainville* is scheduled to load miscellaneous goods in Shanghai on the 7th of this month and set sail for Haiphong and Saigon. This ship does not carry passengers. The cargo ship *Kindia*, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 6th of this month, has been delayed en route and will arrive on the 8th. Cargo ships *Si Kiang* and *Bangkok* are currently stationed in Saigon, waiting to load food supplies, and will continue to sail to Shanghai. Although the situation in Vietnam is tense, the company's ships continue to operate between Shanghai and Vietnam as usual, without any obstruction.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing People's Food Supply Proceeding Gradually; Over 100,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Cut Noodles Revised to 49 Cents per *Jin*</h3>
<p>The people's food supply in Shanghai has only slightly improved. In order to plan for the future, the authorities intend to proceed in accordance with the established plan, which includes (1) unblocking the source of domestic rice, having recently consulted with the Shanghai "Municipal Government," which is still in progress; (2) assisting rice merchants and various people's food organizations to purchase and transport large quantities of foreign rice to Shanghai for sale; (3) cracking down on speculation and preventing illegal transactions in the market, requiring all rice merchants, regardless of whether they are selling futures or spot goods in the market, to release their stocks at the limited price, otherwise they will be punished according to law, without any leniency.</p>
<p>Over 100,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived Yesterday</p>
<p>Approximately 200,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai during the Spring Festival, and over 100,000 bags have continued to arrive after the holiday. Yesterday, the French ship *Valarena* arrived from Vietnam with over 30,000 bags of rice, the Italian ship *Deltadue* carried 54,000 bags of貢米, and the French ship *Vinh Thuan* transported over 17,000 bags of Siamese rice. Statistics show that over 100,000 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and over 300,000 bags have already been ordered and are expected to arrive in Shanghai continuously this month, so the current grain reserves in the city are very abundant.</p>
<p>Manipulation of Some Stored Rice</p>
<p>After the market opened yesterday, although rice prices did not exceed the new limited price, futures prices rose by two yuan compared to the previous day. If this is not curbed, the future is still uncertain. It is found that the daily transaction volume of Japanese rice in the market is consistently around 15,000 bags. Considering that the city's daily demand is only 9,000 bags, it exceeds the demand by 6,000 bags. In addition to rice stores purchasing a portion, a portion is also purchased by hoarders, leading to rising prices. Therefore, citizens generally hope that the authorities will immediately curb this. The absurd rumors circulating in the market, such as rising import prices and the Japanese side planning to levy taxes on貢米, must be suppressed to stabilize market prices.</p>
<p>1,000 Bags of Ordered Rice to Arrive in Three Days</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Cooperative Association's third batch of 1,000 bags of ordered rice was loaded on a ship in Vietnam on the 3rd of this month, with a price of 98 yuan per bag, including war risk insurance, and will soon be distributed to the third batch of subscribers. There are approximately 100 bags remaining in the fourth batch. Those who wish to subscribe are urged to participate as soon as possible. Also, the method of distributing the first and second batches of rice that arrived provides that each bag for small subscribers is re-packaged, weighing exactly 198 *jin*. However, large subscribers were directly distributed at the dock on Lunar New Year's Eve and were not re-packaged, so some have sent letters stating that the rice is short. Once the association has completed the distribution of the first and second batches of rice, it will adjust the shortage. In the future, all arriving rice will be repackaged at the warehouse to ensure a weight of 198 *jin*, in order to ensure fairness.</p>
<p>Retail Price of Cut Noodles to Increase Starting Today</p>
<p>The Machine-Made Cut Noodles Industry Association states that the factory price of flour is 23 yuan per bag, plus a handling fee of 30 cents, totaling 23.30 yuan, which is 1.5 yuan higher than the previous flour price. With the consent of the authorities, it has been decided that, starting from February 5, the retail price of cut noodles in the market will be revised to 49 cents per *jin*. Members should sell in accordance with the prices set by the association and should not exceed the limit. As for the 126 newly registered businesses, the association will request the authorities to provide relief in order to universally assist civilians in the border areas. The stable price sale of flour by Fufeng and Fuxin Flour Mills has been reported. It is known that Fufeng distributed 1,059 bags daily on January 31st and February 1st, and Fuxin sold 5,000 bags daily, totaling 12,118 bags. These bags have not yet been sold. Therefore, an extra day of distribution will be added this Wednesday.

<h3>Jin Huating's Remains to Be Encoffined This Afternoon; Remains Appear Lifelike After Makeup; Central Figures Send Condolences and Funeral Gifts</h3>
<p>*Shen Bao* reporter Yu Huating was fatally shot by thugs at 4:30 AM the day before yesterday. When the sad news spread, all sectors of society, both Chinese and foreign, deeply mourned. His remains were moved from the small sickroom on Terrasse Road to the operating room of the Shanghai Funeral Home at noon yesterday. Several relatives and friends, with grief-stricken faces, were tearfully taking care of the situation at the scene. When reporters visited before 4:00 PM yesterday, they saw that Mr. Jin's remains had been made up by technicians, and his appearance was lifelike, inspiring respect. Yesterday, people from all walks of life visited in an endless stream, expressing their deep regret. This shows how deeply Mr. Jin had touched people's hearts on a daily basis. The encoffining of the remains is scheduled for 3:00 PM this afternoon. Mr. Jin's relatives and friends have organized a funeral committee to handle everything.</p>
<p>Central Figures Send Telegrams of Condolence</p>
<p>(Chongqing, 4th) After the tragic news of the *Shen Bao* reporter Jin Huating being shot and killed spread, all sectors of society here deeply mourned. Wang Shijie, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Deputy Ministers Pan Gongzhan and Dong XianGuang, and Central Committee members Jiang Bocheng and Wu Kaixian have respectively requested the Central Government to issue an order of commendation and provide preferential compensation. Mr. Wang and others also sent telegrams to Shanghai expressing their condolences and funeral gifts. The original telegrams are as follows: (1) To the *Shen Bao* in Shanghai, forwarded to the Jin family: Mr. Huating was an outstanding talent for the Party and the country, a prominent figure in the press, with a loyal nature and strong determination. His tragic death is deeply mourned. In addition to requesting the Central Government to issue an order of commendation and provide preferential compensation, we hereby offer a funeral gift of 2,000 yuan in advance, hoping that you will restrain your grief and take care of important matters. Shijie, Gongzhan, XianGuang, kowtow; (2) We are shocked and deeply saddened to hear of Mr. Huating's tragic death. Mr. Huating was upright, hated evil like an enemy, and was highly respected in the media. His death is heavier than Mount Tai, but his righteousness will live on forever and serve as a model, which is worthy of no regret. We hereby offer a funeral gift of 3,000 yuan in advance, and will separately request the Central Government to issue an order of commendation.

<p>Wu Shaoshu Speaks</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 4th) Wu Shaoshu, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, was shocked and saddened to hear in Hong Kong that *Shen Bao* reporter Jin Huating had been shot and killed by thugs. He immediately sent a telegram to Mr. Jin's family to express his condolences and sent a funeral gift of 1,000 yuan. According to Mr. Wu's conversation with reporters, since Shanghai became an isolated island, the press has been repeatedly devastated and oppressed, and loyal people have been tragically killed, including Mr. Zhu Xinggong, Zhang Sixu, Cheng Zhenzhang, and Shao Xubai. Now that Mr. Jin has sacrificed himself for his beliefs, the thugs' murder of outstanding talents is truly hateful. Mr. Jin was a well-known figure in the Chinese press, a loyal and upright person with a strong will. In recent years, he had been repeatedly targeted, but he persevered and never withered. This spirit of loyalty, courage, and determination is a model for the world. Although he sacrificed his life for the country, his righteousness will remain in the world, and his death is heavier than Mount Tai.</p>
<p>Colleagues and Friends Send Letters and Telegrams of Condolence</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jin family funeral committee received letters and telegrams of condolence from colleagues in the press and friends from all over the world, including: (1) Bloom, manager of Reuters, wrote that Mr. Jin's tragic death was a great loss to the press; (2) the *Zhongmei Daily* sent a letter expressing deep grief and extending sincere condolences upon hearing of Mr. Jin's death; (3) Chen Xunyu from Hong Kong sent a telegram expressing his grief and sorrow at Mr. Jin's misfortune; (4) Zhang Changren from Hengyang sent a telegram expressing his deep sorrow upon hearing the sad news of the death of his brother Huating. In addition, those who sent funeral gifts included Pu Jiting, the Nanjing Road Reading Room, and several anonymous donors.</p>
<h3>First Special Court Bombing Case: Driver Suspected and Detained, Rental Car Permit Found Outside Criminal Court Wall,祥泰 Motor Company Previously Hijacked by Robbers</h3>
<p>On the third of this month, a little after 4:00 AM, three hand grenades were thrown at the open space outside the criminal court of the First Special District Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai on North Zhejiang Road, and the civil court on Weihaiwei Road. Although they exploded at the time, no one was injured. After investigation by the Jing'an Temple Police Station and the Huishi Police Station, it was determined that the two cases were related and committed by the same person. A suspect, Zhou Weishan from Tongzhou, was arrested and escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. According to Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station,</p>
<p>Presented the Case,</p>
<p>Stating that before the incident at the civil court of the First Special Court on Weihaiwei Road, a Chinese policeman with badge number 1801 witnessed a car, number 1801, traveling very quickly from east to west. As it approached the civil court, the car suddenly slowed down, and then the bombing occurred, making a loud noise. Subsequently, six long gun bullets were found outside the affected wall. Furthermore, at around 6:00 AM on the 3rd, the suspect Zhou Weishan was apprehended. Investigations revealed that Zhou lived at No. 80 in Longzhi Lane, Kang'nou Road, and worked for</p>
<p>祥泰 Motor Company</p>
<p>at No. 566 Weihaiwei Road as a driver. The car he drove, No. 17744, was hired out at 12:00 AM on February 2nd and returned at 5:00 AM the next morning. However, there was a piece of paper pasted on the car's license plate, most of which had been torn off. It appeared that the number had been altered during use. However, Zhou confessed to the police station that he drove to the United Overseas Chinese Association at No. 6 Difeng Road to pick up a fare on the night of the 2nd. Suddenly, two people came to hire the car, and when they drove to Yanping Road, four more people came. One of them</p>
<p>Threatened with a Gun,</p>
<p>Bound Zhou's hands and blindfolded him. These people drove themselves to a certain place, stopped the car, and pushed Zhou into a room. At 5:00 AM, these people returned, still forced Zhou into the car, and released him at Xiaoshadu Road, Laobosen Road, threatening him not to report to the police, otherwise they would retaliate. Zhou then drove back. Later, after the criminal court of the First Special Court was also bombed, the police station found a rental car certificate from the祥泰 Motor Company outside the wall,</p>
<p>Specifying the Car Number</p>
<p>As 17744, and the time as 10:00 PM on February 2nd. The driver's name was Zhou Fushan, who was Zhou Weishan's older brother. Now, because the name of the driver and the time on the rental car do not match, the police station must continue the investigation, so he requested permission to detain him. Zhou Weishan confessed to the above situation. The magistrate verified the confession and ordered Zhou to be detained pending further investigation for seven days.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Arrest on Laobosen Road, One Thief Shot on the Spot, Stray Bullet Injures a Man</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 6:00 PM, two robbers suddenly broke into No. 1683 Yinghua Lane on Laobosen Road, Xuhui. One robber brandished a gun to intimidate, intending to rob. The victim immediately shouted for help. The robbers panicked and, before they could steal anything, rushed out to escape. Nearby Chinese police officers had already arrived after hearing the alarm and bravely stepped forward to arrest them. The robbers immediately opened fire to resist arrest, and the Chinese police officers also drew their guns and fired back. The two sides exchanged fire. As a result, one robber, named Chen Jinbao, 26 years old, was shot in the abdomen. The other robber escaped without a trace. Afterwards, a suspect was apprehended nearby. During the confrontation, Wang Yinsong, a 32-year-old man from Jiangbei who lived at No. 12 Yinghua Lane, was going out when he was struck in the chest by a stray bullet. The police summoned an ambulance to take Wang Yinsong to Baolong Hospital. The injured robber was sent to the police hospital for treatment. It is said that both of them were seriously injured and their lives may be in danger.</p>
<h3>Police Arrest Gambling, Conflict Erupts, Both Sides Open Fire, One Employee Injured</h3>
<p>Last night at 9:35 PM, a gambling den opposite the Hungarian Hotel on Difeng Road, YuYuan Road, was raided by a large group of people. For some reason, a conflict broke out with the guards of the gambling den. Both sides opened fire, and Xue Afu, a 57-year-old employee of the gambling den, was struck in the head by a stray bullet. He was taken to Tongren Second Hospital by car for treatment.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Man Zeng You Arrested for Extorting Gambling Dens, Husband and Wife Quarrel and Reveal Secret, Explosives Found, Both Detained for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Zeng You, a Cantonese man, was idle and did nothing. Seeing the proliferation of gambling dens in Shanghai, he conceived a way to make easy money. He specially made a type of explosive and carried it to various gambling dens to intimidate them. If they did not pay him money, he would use the explosives against them. Therefore, the gambling dens feared his power and</p>
<p>Paid Monthly Allowances.</p>
<p>The largest payer was the Six Nations Hotel, which paid 400 yuan per month. The others paid varying amounts ranging from a hundred to several tens of yuan. Zeng would issue receipts stating that he had received a certain amount of labor money from a certain gambling den, with the name of the Guang Tianzi Hall or the Guangdong Five Tigers Hall written below. In total, his monthly income was no less than several thousand yuan. Zeng had a concubine, Ms. Xu, 29 years old, who lived with him at No. 153 Guling Road. Recently, their relationship suddenly broke down. At 2:20 PM the day before yesterday, near Guling Road and Beihe Road, they had a big quarrel. Detective Wang Xianliang and Chinese policeman No. 139 saw them and</p>
<p>Arrested Both of Them.</p>
<p>A package of yellow explosive powder was found on Xu's person. They then went to their residence and found ten Guang Tianzi Hall and other seals, as well as five receipts from Dafaco Company Liyuan Gambling Den, etc. They were taken to the Xinzha Police Station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Dayin presented the case and requested detention. The court approved the detention of both defendants pending further verification in seven days.</p>
<h3>Young Man Steals Clothes to Gamble, Chops Cousin to Death</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 AM yesterday, a blood case occurred in Qiwun Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha Road, where a cousin chopped his cousin to death. The ins and outs of the case are as follows: Lin Wei, a Ningbo native, 25 years old, lived in a garret on the second floor of No. 16 in the lane. His monthly income was barely enough to make ends meet. Lin had a cousin, Qiu Xiangbiao (24 years old). Three years ago, Qiu was destitute and homeless, so Lin took him in and introduced him to a job to earn a living. Recently, Qiu suddenly became addicted to gambling, frequenting various gambling dens and losing repeatedly. He resorted to low tactics. The night before last, while Lin was fast asleep, Qiu stole Lin's wool overcoat and pawned it to gamble and lost the money. At around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, Lin got up and discovered that his clothes were missing. Knowing it was Qiu's doing, he questioned him, and an argument ensued. The argument turned into a physical fight. Qiu, young and impetuous, disregarding the consequences, suddenly used a kitchen knife to slash at Lin wildly, about fifty or sixty times, leaving Lin covered in blood. The roommate discovered the situation, gathered people, and apprehended Qiu while reporting to the police and summoning a car to send the injured Lin to Baolong Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, Lin died upon arrival at the hospital.</p>

<h3>Our Newspaper's Provincial Maps Selling Well: Few Remaining, Price Increase Imminent</h3>

<p>Respectfully announcing that our factory's retail department, on January 26th (i.e., the last day of the lunar year) at 4:00 PM, in the midst of a busy business day, suddenly discovered a bundle of banknotes left on the counter.

<h3>Lester School Student Zhang Haizhong Nearly Kidnapped, Bandits Broke into School Attempting Kidnapping, Teachers Called Police, Kidnappers Fled in Panic</h3>
<p>Zhang Haizhong, a 14-year-old student in the third grade of junior high school at Lester School of Technology, No. 505 East Xi Huade Road, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou, is the second son of Zhang Gongruo, the current Chinese General Manager of Yizhong Tobacco Company. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, while Haizhong was chatting with classmates on campus, four kidnappers suddenly rushed into the school with weapons, dragged Zhang out, and attempted to kidnap him. Fortunately, a teacher at the school, Aimes, saw this and shouted "robbers" from the window. The kidnappers then drew their guns and fired two shots as a warning, fortunately without injuring anyone. After the four robbers fled, they unexpectedly encountered a patrolling Japanese marine corps unit passing by and dared not take the hostage with them. They abandoned the child and fled in all directions without a trace. The Zhang student was unharmed and returned to school. Soon after, the police received the news and dispatched a large team of Chinese and foreign detectives to search the scene of the incident and block the bridges over the Suzhou Creek for a search. They arrested one armed bandit and took him to the police station for investigation. It was then learned that the bandit was not the perpetrator of the previous case because the bullets in his gun were not the same as those used by the previous case. The search for the bandits' whereabouts is still underway.</p>

It stipulates that starting from the 29th academic year, first-year students in high schools and junior high schools should immediately follow it. Other grades will remain the same for the time being. The main points of the new table are two: one is that English is changed to an elective course in junior high school, and the other is that teaching is divided into groups, with Group A emphasizing mathematics and science. For the convenience of implementation, the Department of Education has also issued a set of important points to note during implementation and circulated them for implementation.

Schools with only a single track may select one of the Group A and Group B implementations and report it for record. 3. Schools should indicate the group being recruited in the recruitment brochure when enrolling students. 4. When implementing this revised teaching subject and hours system, schools should adhere to the spirit of experimentation, study and improve it at any time, and submit a summary report to the Department of Education for record at the end of the academic year.</p>

<h3>Provinces Emphasize Training of Public Education Center Staff</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 4th) The cause of public education centers in various provinces was previously regulated by the Ministry of Education's promulgation of laws and regulations and the specification of work standards.

It has hired Zhang Cheng, who has served as the principal of famous provincial schools in Jiangsu for many years, as the principal. Since opening classes in Shanghai, due to the principal's responsibility, excellent teachers, strict management, and serious curriculum, the number of students has increased dramatically every term. In order to improve the students' level for the purpose of further education or employment, the high school section, in addition to teaching the subjects according to the Ministry's standards, also has advanced chemistry, advanced physics, advanced biology (all of which are freshman-year university courses), and English elective courses to make up for arithmetic and bank bookkeeping, as well as holding essay competitions. Students attend class all day, have no time to wander around, and are therefore praised by parents who strictly urge their children to study. It is reported that the school is currently recruiting transfer students for all grades of high school and junior high school, and there are still vacancies. However, there is a shortage of beds for boarding students due to the excessive number of boarders.</p>

<h3>Xiqing Basketball League: Huaxing to Face Little Bears Tonight, Huaxing vs. Maihong at 8:15</h3>
<p>There will be two games in the Xiqing Basketball League tonight. The perennial champions Huaxing will meet the Little Bears, starting at 7:15. Since the return of Fu Jinsheng and others, Huaxing's strength has become even more abundant. The pillars of the Little Bears team, Carson and Yenic, left Shanghai a few days ago. The entire team relies solely on Toblin Ge to support it. The lineup is sparse and scattered and is no match for Huaxing. The other game is Shangxing vs. Mailand Hong. The two teams are evenly matched and can be called evenly matched. Meeting at that time, a fierce battle is inevitable. The league is coming to an end, and the championship will depend on the game between Maijun Guan and Huaxing. Maijun has already won two runner-up finishes. The defending champion, Paramount, has been unable to support itself since Li Zhenzhong and Bao Songyuan left this year and ranks fourth. The Little Bears are still ahead of them. If Shanghai Star can defeat Paramount, it can also jump ahead of them. Mailand Hong has been in last place for a long time. Tonight's schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>Recent Situation</p>
<h3>Western Union Football: Recent Situation of Each Group</h3>
<p>Western Union Football, Group A: Donghua's championship this year has begun to waver. I hope the Donghua athletes will take care of themselves. There are still three games against Portugal, Beixi Children, and Xibu. If good news is spread, there is still hope for the championship. The preliminary group is idle. The entire schedule will be completed. Donghua's two games against Xibu and Saint Francis are also related to the future of the championship. Beixi Children has steadily won the last place. Group B: The British Navy quickly won two games, and the score increased sharply, jumping to second place. The French Army and Youyou Club have successively fallen behind by one place. The Park United has now fallen to the bottom. Group C: Ruowensi still sits firmly on the throne. Weituoning and Osmont have the same scores and closely follow behind. The Hua Team, Yizhong, and Zhendan Team are ranked fourth and fifth. The Hualian Team and others have played fewer games and may become champions in the future. The recent situation of the three groups is as follows:</p>

<h3>Pei Cheng Cup Women's Table Tennis: Feng Mingyin Wins Championship, Gui Rongzheng Runner-Up, Zhang Lizhi Third Place</h3>
<p>The Pei Cheng Cup Senior Group Individual Table Tennis Championship held by Pei Cheng Girls' Middle School was attended by a total of ten people. The top five winners were determined by a single round-robin system to decide the champion, runner-up, and third place. After many days of round-robin battles, the final match was held between Feng Mingyin and Feng Huizhu in the school auditorium the day before yesterday. There were many visitors and the situation was lively. Chen Linsheng served as the referee. Feng Mingyin was good at both offense and defense, and her hitting posture was excellent. She is indeed an outstanding talent who has emerged recently. Feng Huizhu is good at chopping balls and was originally a strong team, but unfortunately, her wrist was injured earlier, and her performance was abnormal, resulting in three consecutive losses. In the final battle, Feng Mingyin became more and more courageous and won a great victory, winning the championship of the cup. Feng Huizhu retreated to fifth place. The results of the final battle and the complete list of winners are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Gilded Teeth: The Crime</h3>
<p>— Manqing</p>
<p>There was a time when it suddenly became popular to gild teeth. The shiny enamel was electrically etched and then covered with a gold shell. So, when speaking, people would deliberately laugh more, revealing their cherry lips and the brilliant golden light, looking very pleased with themselves. In fact, if you talk about beauty, the "arranged shells" in old novels were definitely not golden. If you talk about being aristocratic, the price of gold at that time was only a dozen yuan per tael. How much could this thin gold shell be worth? However, because it was "popular," when people opened their mouths, even their canine teeth were subjected to the "beautiful" electric torture. Many dentists also made their fortunes because of it.</p>
<p>Once the enamel is damaged, it causes endless trouble. The dentist becomes a medical consultant, and visits to Ramón y Cajal are a normal expense. However, even now, there are unexpected gains, that is, this thin gold shell has increased at least thirty times in value. When there is no rice for dinner, you can knock it off and pawn it. If you want to make light of it, it is "speculation."</p>
<p>But there are two sides to the story. Precisely because it is easy to pawn, in addition to "skinning pigs," "skinning field chickens," and "skinning ears" (gun earrings), "skinning teeth" was also invented - knocking your teeth out, root and all. This bloody punishment was probably not what people expected when they were learning to be "beautiful," right? In the past, they were "always laughing," but now it is too late to close their bird mouths.</p>
<p>Writing this, I remembered an ancient saying, called "Don't show your wealth." You are speculating today and speculating tomorrow. Aren't the people next to you eyeing your piled-up wealth? What is the crime of the teeth? Gilding teeth is the crime. Isn't it an even better deal to pull this piled-up wealth out by the roots?</p>
<h3>Flight</h3>
<p>— Luo Lin</p>
<p>Today, the group in this mansion are like headless flies, everyone wearing a look of extreme panic, packing things, pulling things east and dragging things west, in a state of utter confusion and fear. Damn it! We just escaped "disaster" last month, and today we have to "flee" again.</p>
<p>Early this morning, just as Boss Zhang was about to ask Ah Lin to drive the car out, a strange letter suddenly arrived. Boss Zhang opened it and took a look, so frightened that his "celestial official"-like face turned the color of a preserved egg. — Boss Zhang often told people that his face was like that of a celestial official — it turned out that the "heroes" were coming to "borrow provisions" again. Yikes! Two hundred and fifty thousand! How could he possibly afford that! He remembered that it wasn't long ago that he had already "borrowed" money to them, and now they were coming again, truly not caring about the life or death of others! Alright, he wouldn't go to the office today. He picked up the phone to call, but today, for some unknown reason, it was like seeing a ghost, he dialed the wrong number three times in a row, and couldn't get through. Boss Zhang's friends advised him to quickly avoid the limelight, a wise man doesn't fight when the odds are against him, it's not worth fighting with them, is it?</p>
<p>"Abao, quickly go upstairs and call the wife and mistresses to get up, but don't shout loudly."</p>
<p>"Wh...what?..."</p>
<p>"Go quickly, damn it!"</p>
<p>"Yes..."</p>
<p>"This is terrible, those women can't stand being frightened, they're all those killers, sigh!"</p>
<p>"Ah, another letter, two hundred and fifty thousand!" The wife saw the strange letter on the table and jumped up in fright.</p>
<p>"Don't shout, quickly...quickly pack up, pack up, and come with me to avoid them, we'll talk about it later."</p>
<p>"Go to ××?"</p>
<p>"No... that's the long room we opened, they must know about it."</p>
<p>"Then..."</p>
<p>"Never mind, go quickly, go quickly!"</p>
<p>Finally, with great effort, like thieves, they escaped into a relatively quiet hotel, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Mom, when I grow up, I'm going to buy a big Guan Dao and kill all the robbers." The young master was quite knowledgeable about martial arts, and everyone laughed.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, what does a child know!" The boss hurriedly stopped him, really, if the news got out, that would be terrible!</p>
<p>"Bang," the boss put down the soda water, and thought to himself, there were still some things to discuss. That's right, fleeing was important, but business was even more important, especially with such big fluctuations these days. So he picked up the phone:</p>
<p>"Hello, Old Wang? I'm at ×× Hotel, Room ××, what's the situation with "Citibank" today? ...Eighteen and a half yuan? Good, sell it off for me...</p>
<p>"Four hundred and twenty Shuangma? Don't sell, don't sell!...</p>
<p>"I won't thank you for dinner tonight, I'll come again the day after tomorrow. I'm not sure if I'll be here tomorrow; alright, goodbye."</p>
<p>After finishing the phone call, the boss returned to his "celestial official" smile. Well, "fleeing but not forgetting to make money," it doesn't matter if you spend a little if you can make a fortune!</p>
<p>"Ah Lin, go and order some dishes for me, and bring two bottles of wine, but you must not talk nonsense outside!"</p>
<p>"Understood." Ah Lin took the banknotes and left, but he thought to himself: "Easy come, easy go, if we escape this trouble, there will be another one, it's all the same anyway."</p>
<h3>Ordinary Things</h3>
<p>— Zhi Xuan</p>
<p>This is an ordinary day. It is not in ancient times, nor is it a legend, but it is happening now; people cannot find anything special about it in their hearts, it is such an ordinary day.</p>
<p>In the evening, the street lights are shining brightly in the night, pedestrians and vehicles are going their separate ways, when suddenly, in a flatbread shop, a woman screamed. At that time, a figure sneaked into the alley opposite; then a man from the shop rushed out from inside and chased after him into the alley. After a while, he dragged a man out, the man had a head of upright long hair, a dirty black face, and a tattered cotton coat, making it clear at a glance what kind of person he was. He was trembling all over, holding two bitten flatbreads in his hands, which made it clear what had happened. Some people watched from afar, while others gathered around to watch; but the man did nothing else, only cursed loudly.</p>
<p>Such things are not surprising. I have also seen a person on a deserted road, also a ragged figure, snatching fried dough sticks and running away, and someone chased after him, but did not catch him. It's all the same, nothing surprising.</p>
<p>I have also heard of huge robberies, where a huge amount of money was robbed, many police officers were mobilized, and the newspapers used large headlines. That is surprising, because it is a huge amount.</p>
<p>But I am surprised, surprised by the people who rob flatbreads and fried dough sticks. Why are their goals so small? Disregarding the law, concerning their lifelong reputation and credit. This is a huge sacrifice, they sacrifice everything for the sake of some small flatbreads and fried dough sticks, and this is worth pondering.</p>
<p>Every day, on the road, stretching out their hands, making pitiful pleas, tracking pedestrians, these things are countless. In front of the rice shops, enduring whips, enduring long hours of waiting, but only for some food. The crowd is like a long snake, stretching across many storefronts. This is most evident, making people realize that there is a boundless and huge shadow.</p>
<p>If someone is surprised by huge robberies, then they should be even more alarmed by such things as robbing flatbreads and fried dough sticks. Because behind these ordinary things, the things that follow are frightening to an unimaginable degree.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>3. The Concubine of the Garrison Commander</p>
<p>This year, Ms. Hou, the principal of Tianjin Provincial Women's Normal School — a fifty-two-year-old spinster — unfortunately made a big mistake unintentionally, but the bad consequences of this big mistake did not affect her personally, but ruined one of her most proud female students; therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that it was a prank.</p>
<p>However, whether before or after the event, Ms. Hou always said, "I had good intentions, I had good intentions." This is not entirely false! The old lady did have good intentions, but unfortunately she did not know that good intentions can sometimes harm people, and even kill people!</p>
<p>The beginning of the matter was just a very ordinary commemorative meeting.</p>
<p>Because the Provincial Women's Normal School was "provincial," it was inevitably somewhat official. Whenever the opening ceremony, graduation ceremony, and all commemorative meetings were held, the local top officials, such as the governor and the military governor, had to be invited to the school, carried into the auditorium like gods, and enshrined for an hour or two, just to borrow their power to make the various ceremonies seem more solemn.</p>
<p>This time was the school's fifth anniversary. Principal Hou, who had always disliked entertainment, firmly rejected the suggestions of the other teachers and refused to add any entertainment programs after the commemorative ceremony. She felt that the purpose of running a school was only to teach students to read, and those vaudeville-like dances and songs were simply superfluous: if she allowed them to perform publicly in front of so many people, it would not only embarrass themselves, but also make her — Principal Hou — lose face. Therefore, this fifth anniversary meeting was still a monotonous series of "ringing the bell to start the meeting, bowing three times to the national flag, the principal's report, the officials' speeches..." Among them, the more interesting ones were the three programs of singing the national anthem, the school song, and the students' thank-you speech: the student's thank-you speech was originally not included, but because this commemorative meeting happened to be held before the summer vacation, it was also used as the graduation ceremony for the fourth graduating class, and the governor was asked to give certificates, and a representative was elected from the students to give a speech of thanks.

<h3>Mrs. Temple Talks About Shirley Temple's Future</h3>
<p>— Qing Hui</p>
<p>Since Shirley Temple officially left Fox Company last year and entered Westlake School for Girls, I have already reported on her school life in this column, but I think her future is also a matter of concern to general movie fans. Mrs. Temple — Shirley's mother — has different plans for her daughter's future. She frankly told us:</p>
<p>"Shirley is not tired of the film industry, but we feel tired, we want her to retire for a year or two to rest. When I explained to her under the lights that George (Shirley's father) and I planned to retire for two years, she opened her eyes as wide as an owl and was silent for a long time before whispering, 'I hope to make movies again soon.' I know she will be unhappy if she doesn't work, making movies is as important as life to her. She is so sincere, but this is what I want to declare, I must use better opportunities to make her career shine.</p>
<p>"Regarding her future, there are currently two decided plans: first, because Shirley still misses the film industry, she will make one movie a year, or at most three movies in two years, but Shirley must have the best script, and there are very few suitable ones at present, so we don't want to sign a long-term contract, but we prefer to sign a per-film contract. Second, because Shirley felt infinitely happy singing 'Silent Night' with Nelson Eddy last Christmas, she may appear on the radio next spring, but the new agreement still needs to be discussed and finalized, and the programs to be broadcast have not been arranged, perhaps broadcasting a children's drama, she can broadcast and sing in her original form. In short, we still put her studies first, and making movies and broadcasting are secondary.</p>
<p>"In addition, several Hollywood film companies want to win Shirley over, but we have rejected them all and have not signed any contracts. As for someone saying that she will join Universal Company, that is also unbelievable, she is just fulfilling her appointment with producer Paneschnik, and will co-star in a film with Deanna Durbin and Greer Garson."</p>
<p>Finally, Mrs. Temple solemnly said: "Even if Shirley returns to the screen in the future, I want her to play real, modern stories with acting skills, and no more of the children's comedies like before."</p>
<h3>Statement of Clarification</h3>
<p>We received a letter yesterday from the "Yunhai Drama Society" stating: Upon reading the letter from the "Fudan Drama Society" published in your January 31st issue, it stated that Mr. Huang Jiaxiang is not a member of the "Fudan Drama Society." After investigation, our society is a drama society organized by students of Fudan Experimental Middle School after school, and Mr. Huang Jiaxiang serves as the director-general. After investigation, students of Fudan Experimental Middle School can also be called Fudan students. On January 11th, your journal published an introduction to "Floating Clouds and Flowing Water" and referred to "Fudan students," without mentioning "Fudan Drama Society," and no error was made. It is appropriate to submit a statement as above.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Art World</h3>
<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>Minhua Company built a very elaborate stage in the studio to shoot "Song of Ancient China," which attracted many movie fans who were eager to show off their skills on it. Under suggestion, it was unanimously approved, so this show was decided. However, as for the date, the Lantern Festival is probably too late. First, "Song of Ancient China" will definitely not be finished before the Lantern Festival. If such a carnival is inserted in the middle, it will be time-consuming and cause unemployment, and the loss will be too great. Second, several of the people participating in this carnival program are "novices." "Novices" are not afraid of being laughed at, but to make people laugh and watch it, it still takes several days of "hard work." Therefore, it seems that the realization of this rehearsal will be after the completion of the work at the "Song of Ancient China" film studio.</p>
<p>Several film practitioners performed "Thunderstorm" at the Ningbo Fellow Association, and the business was very good, so they worked harder and performed "Spring Comes to the World" again starting today. It is expected that soon after, such public performances will be like "bamboo shoots after rain."</p>
<p>I met Wu Chengda and Shen Qi on the road, and when talking about Minhua's carnival program, Wu and Shen volunteered and said that they would also participate in a program and invite Ms. Sun Jinglu and Mei Xia to co-star in "Double Five Flower Cave," but the opportunity has not yet matured, and this "ideal play" can only be announced after Ms. Sun and Mei agree.</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang directed "Red Powder Golden Ge," starring Wang Xichun and Shu Shi, etc. It is now being adapted and improved into a Peking opera by Pei Chong. Once the script is completed, it may be performed by the Peking opera group of the Xinyi Drama Society, or it may be performed by Zhang Yipeng and others, it is not yet known.</p>
