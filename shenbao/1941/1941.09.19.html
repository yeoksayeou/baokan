<h3>美國宣佈實行護航</h3>
<p>美總統羅斯福十一日晚的播講，爲了答覆納粹在海上的挑釁，表示已下令美國海軍於察見軸心船隻在美國國防領海上出現時即加以射擊，以保護一切美國以及在美國國防領海上經商之其他國籍船隻，俾其不遭受潛艇及海面剽襲艦的攻擊，這已經是實際上的護航，他却並未明顯採用護航的字樣。但在前夜美海長諾克斯對新聞記者的談話，則已公然正式宣布美海軍的實行護航，以保障援英物品之安全運達。從通過租借法案和擴大巡邏制度而後，這是美國更進一步逼近戰爭的步驟。</p>
<p>美國對於現行歐戰的一貫政策是確保援英戰具到達以促進英國的勝利，美國自身則避免直接參戰。在這兩個條件之中，前者是絕對的，爲了求其貫澈不惜採取一切可能手段；而後者則爲相對的，要隨時看客觀形勢而決定態度，如果事實上有其必要，避免參並不是絕對不可動搖的原則。一年以前，反對參戰的主張確在美國具有絕大勢力，致使羅斯福總統去歲杪的爐邊談話和今年年初的國會咨文中，都不能不特別標出避免牽入戰爭漩渦的原則。在這一年的過程中，由援英而擴大巡邏，而實行護航，一步步逼近參戰的邊緣，，反對參戰的呼聲反而日見消沉，即有一味抱殘守缺如林白上校之流，也不足以聳動視聽，這一重大的轉變，自然是美當局運用之力與人民覺悟之故，而最大原因，却仍在於納粹的咄咄逼人，步步進迫，致使孤立與避戰的見解無復存在的餘地。更何况英國雖曾遭敗衂，實力依然完整，以目前的國際形勢而言，擊潰納粹在原則上已有相當把握，美國雖然日益加重其對於歐戰的義務與責任，但却與因英國實力崩潰而不得不謀積極行動者逈異其趣，這也就是護航一舉能夠如此一無阻力的順利宣告實施的緣故。</p>
<p>自羅斯福宣佈決實行肅淸在美國領海上出現的軸心艦艇而後，軸心方面雖然斷斷怒詈，而前此接二連三的美船被襲事件反而暫告絕跡。另一方面，直到此際爲止，尚未聞有軸心艦艇被美方護航艦隊所擊沉或俘獲的消息，如果連日大西洋平靜無事的情况不是偶然，則大概必是納粹在美方堅決應付之下業已知難而退。今年四五月間，德國的剽襲政策確曾在大西洋一度奏效，其最高紀錄每週竟擊沉英輪四十餘萬噸（據德方報告數字），且傳美國援英戰具有百分之四十被擊沉於大西洋海底；但據本月九日英相邱吉爾在下院的報告，則大西洋形勢已大見起色，一方英國與協約國船隻的喪失大减，另方則德義船隻在六七八三個月中喪失激增，七八兩月英國及協約國船隻因德國襲擊而遭沉沒者尚不及德義喪於英國飛機潛艇下者的三分之一。準此而論，則德方在海上的剽襲實力，應付英國且虞不足，何况更益以美國的龐大艦隊。此際美國所用於大西洋護航的艦艇，大概也就以前此担任巡邏任務時大西洋艦隊爲主體，計共戰艦一百二十餘艘，除却三隻舊式主力艦與四隻重巡洋艦而外，約有三分之二以上屬於輕型的驅逐艦和潛水艇，再加上空軍的合作，那正是爲了對付德方剽襲而配置的。據前晚美海長諾克斯的談話：護航方法，日新月異，美國現正悉數採用了這些新的方法。即使德國潛艇飛機產量驚人，人材則培植匪易。而在自身四面遭受封鎖之中，把大量實力任意消耗在英美海空軍的聯合警備之下，而實際上並不能發揮切斷美戰具供英的效果，無論如何是不智的舉動。是以預料在美海軍實行護航而後，大西洋的剽襲行動即不致宣告絕跡，亦將不能爲患、倘若不是發生更重大的變化，美國仍舊可以繼續保持避免直接參戰的傳統政策。</p>
<p>假如日前德方之加緊襲擊美國輸艦，是爲了破壞美日談判並脅迫日本表明其對軸心盟約義務的態度，則此一用意可謂全告失敗。美日談判固然不會有何等結果，但那並非德人破壞之力，而日方近頃對三國盟約態度的冷淡，除非德國獲有斷然勝利而外，也不是德方任何姿態所能挽回。專就這一點而論，納粹的襲擊美船，也沒有再繼續擴大的必要。</p>

<h3>經濟談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳</p>
<p>躉船者，以稱從大船上剝卸貨物運至　上之船也。躉船之名，由來已久，或係與中英通商以俱來。蓋此一名詞，首先見之於廣州，其後遂從粵人而漸散播於沿海通商口岸，至今成爲通用名詞，而不知其原義之由來矣。</p>
<p>余嘗在梁廷柟夷氛紀聞中，見有躉船之名稱。其言曰：</p>
<p>「孟阿臘與孟買部，皆鴉片所自出。乾隆初年以來，內地嗜食漸衆，販運奢積歲而多，一時來至二萬餘箱，價值逾六千萬。由南洋新埠，陸續運至粵海，伶仃洋船，隨賣隨又運至不絕，謂之躉船。全恃內地游手走私奸民，爲之載棹入口，液輸內地，沿海邊郡，遞於天津，皆躉船之所流注。販戶先收貨會城，入夷館，易鴉片單出，付買省，持示躉船，則按數而給」</p>
<p>茲就文字而論，「謂之躉船」，足證躉船一名，至是方有。「皆躉船之所流注」，則沿海邊郡，以至天津，知有躉，皆從鴉片走私而來。</p>
<p>躉之義何所取，從躉爲零之對，蓋躉言其整數，如躉批，如躉買，皆言大宗批發買賣也。然「躉」本俗字，造作此宇之意義，諒係囿於舊時之財貨界域，以有「萬貫家財」爲滿足，故萬字之下加足字，極言其數之大也。今用之於剝貨之船，則剝船上所載之貨，終覺無多，且係從大船上分卸而來，不能謂之整，即亦不能謂之躉。至謂船上之貨爲躉賣，而非零拆，故稱其船曰躉船，亦不近悄，若據此說，即批發之店可稱爲躉店。要知當時之躉船，實爲洋船巨大，不能駛入伶仃洋，或慮中國官廳禁止，故不敢駛入，乃停泊於外洋，由剝船將鴉片運至內海。爲之居間交易之所，則爲夷館，夷館奢，夷人所居，即爲後之領事館也。交易成，方至躉船取貨，則躉船之作用，實係將大船上卸下之貨物，暫時作一存頓之所。余故對於孟心史所云：「所謂躉船，或本是頓船，爲停頓之意」，表同意。惟孟氏尚不欲確定其名稱爲頓船，表示「或本是」之意，且亦不推究躉字得名之由來，及應作頓船之理由安在，余不敏，一申其說，孟氏若在，不知以余言爲何如！</p>
<p>余以爲躉之爲躉，旣從當時洋貨買賣而來，而在中國文義，躉船一字，難得滴當之解釋，其必與洋文之音有關。因思躉船之躉，與噸位之噸，同是洋人之口語，華人傚習其音而沿用之，故夷氛紀聞中噸位之噸亦作躉，更足證余之理解爲不謬。蓋噸位之噸，木從英語Ton之發音而來，可作躉，則躉船之躉，又焉知不同樣從英語Tender而稱爲躉船，故躉奢譯音也，非譯義。</p>
<p>Tender者，本係從大船將乘客貨物以達陸上之船也。亦有爲儲大船上所用糧食等船舶之稱，「言以蔽之，爲輔佐大船所不及，以便大船與陸上之聯接，不論其爲乘客貨物，皆資以到達陸上爲目的之船隻也。揆之中國原有之字，可稱之爲剝船（現通作駁船），若用英文之音以相呼，自以譯作「頓船」音義最相近。</p>
<p>緣「頓」之音義，本從「屯」而來，故有停頓，存頓，寄頓，並有存貯之意，與今之躉船作用實相近，音亦相似：（鄙人尚有談屯積一文俟將來有機會發表，可參閱）蓋躉船之貨物，無非就大船中所載之貨物，不能直達，暫時存頓以抵岸，並非躉批之謂也。當時之作者，求一時之便，寫作爲躉船，今欲求其音義並可相通，則何如稱爲頓船之爲恰當。</p>
<p>又英語稱用以拖運貨船之小汽船，爲Tug，如吾人在黃浦江中所常見者，一小汽船之後，聯接之貨船三四艘，鼓浪而去。　Tug雖亦爲運貨之用，而非直接裝卸貨物，故與躉船有別。余爲便於讀者閱覽起見，故標題仍作躉船。</p>

<h3>茶（二）</h3>
<p>— 李毓鏞</p>
<p>（續四日）</p>
<p>但是多數學者的意見還是折衷我國和印度兩說的，以　原產西藏高原諸山，係著名茶樹學者斯叨特氏（Coben　Staurt）的意見，和他們又不同，他說我國的茶和印度的茶出於不同的系統，我國的小葉種，原產我國，野生印度·緬甸·安南一帶的大葉種，我國東南，無其出產，他並用雜交的趨勢考查，其分布遷移。我國的學者仍主張原產我國說，以爲川滇的野茶東栘爲小葉種，西移爲大葉種，「關於東移的記載，上已言之。考諸記載，阿　密　現的茶，是有集團有規則栽植的，當地土人還用以製茶。1815拉特（Latter）及决年加得納（Gardner）也都說阿薩密東北部土人鄉村中有茶樹生長，利用其葉，絕未爲土人利用的只見於蒙自。斯叨特氏也說，中印重要交通要道，都栽茶樹。至於我國原產的茶能不能變大葉呢？劉軫氏說：近年福建省有一種水仙種葉子比普通的長大一倍。又有一種佛手種葉旣很大而日爲廣形，所以茶的野種自川滇西移，因爲氣候和栽植採摘方法的不同，積久以後，變漸大葉種，也是很有可能的</p>
<p>我國茶輸入歐洲，有一段很長的歷史，最早是九世紀中葉回敎商人索利曼（Soleman）在天方波斯中國旅行記（1845）說，「中國慣飲一枯物名Sakh者，其柴香而苦味，相傳健體，國內各處售之」。馬哥孛羅來華，在他遊記裏面，却沒有提到茶。十六世紀葡萄牙在我國通商的時候，茶雖已盛行，但並未和我國交易。歐洲人第一個記茶的是馬腓伊（Mattei）的印度史（1589），後來孔德（Comte）的「中華新紀」記茶頗詳。把茶輸入歐洲的，始於荷蘭的東印度公司，利特生（Lettson）在茶記1772中說，荷人在十七世紀初運茶入歐，但不自中國却自日本。菩門（Bomene）博物詞典（1791）在「薩爾維亞」一字下有一段有趣的故事，他說我們普通的薩爾維亞，很爲中國人及日本人所喜，荷蘭人常在南歐收集這枯物，帶到中國掉換他們的茶，一大箱的薩爾維亞可換兩三箱的茶，但無他籍可徵。荷蘭人在十七世紀携茶入歐，雖不可靠，但携茶入歐的，無疑是荷蘭人。1641年阿姆斯特丹一位物理學家叫圖耳彼烏（Tulpiug）的，做一部藥記，說茶他未見過，但1658年派索（Piso）却說歐洲的貴族已飲茶相尚矣。或說茶在一六〇〇先傳入俄，一六三六入巴黎，一六五〇入英國，至活的茶樹的移植，恐怕是荷蘭人始。但澤有一個商人叫做布累因（Breyn）在1689年出荷蘭植物園植物圖譜中有茶，說它栽於阿姆斯提洛丹園中，但普　所知，都以爲瑞典的林那（Linnaeus）爲第一人，林那所栽的茶是埃克開堡（Eckeberg）寄給他的，運到的時間是1763年十月一日，比荷蘭人至少遲八十餘年。林那是替茶定名的第一人，他不知道紅茶綠茶自一種製成的，起初（1737）叫它Thea　Chinensis，後來1762）把它分做紅茶（J．Bohea）及綠茶（T．Viridis），Bohea即武夷山的意思，後來又經數决改易，才恢復最早的名字。在茶的種下，還分爲若干變種，投斯叨特的意見，可有四類，即普通的武夷變種（Var．Bohea），川種的大葉變種（Var．Macrophylla），上緬甸變種（Var．shanform），及阿薩密變種（Var．Assamica），我們所見的普洱茶，即第四種所製的。　（完）</p>

<h3>希望與策勵（一）　寫在工商組助學金後　第四十六號中請人撰</h3>
<p>申報已六十九歲了，而服務社會，發揚文化的精神，至今日眞所謂老當益壯。此次同情淸寒子弟，舉辦助學金，向其廣大讀者作誠摯的呼籲。凡得到資助者，莫不深自慶幸，而衷心銘感，更非筆墨及言詞能表達。我們感激之餘，惟有刻苦自惕，勤奮向學，忠於職守，庶幾不辜負申報及其廣大讀者的厚望。</p>
<p>工商從業員的處境，較一般在學子弟更爲悽慘與堅苦。就我自己，九歲喪父，十三歲跨出學校之門，爲了生活，祇有走向十字街頭來乞食。家裏有多病的母親須供養，二個年幼兄弟須扶持，自己又是智識技能未全的羔羊。自十五歲進某大公共機關任職，至今這遙長的九年中，操作與淚水，就是我生活的友伴。然而我是靑年，我有前途，所以刻刻在荊棘途中，探取智識，追求眞理，小則同然爲改善個人生活，大則希冀不虛爲一個人。這次申請助金，幸得核准，欣蹤萬狀！讀畢全部名單後，心中又多感觸。而此次舉辦，尚屬創舉，其不免有未盡合捐輸者的理想，故敢將公布於報端之事實，作一回顧，並附愚見，及對得助諸友作進一言，聊盡一已的職責，以冀助學運動發揚光大。是否有當，尚祈社會人士有以敎我，幸甚！感甚！</p>
<p>自申報資助在學子弟後，由於工商界從業員的熱烈請求，熱心職業敎育的捐輸者的建議，經助金委員諸公滇密的考慮後，決定撥資舉辦工商組助學金。開始於八月二十四日，公布簡則二項，即必須得到經理之核准，以免妨礙業務，及申請以學費爲主。申請第一日，即突出二百餘人，自二十八日起分批作個別談話，以作定奪。並即速於九月一日起陸續公布核准名單及金額。</p>
<p>自舉辦工商組助金的消息公布後，又有一熱烈的現象，即各業餘補習學校，紛紛響應，願爲申報捐設免費或半費額，共策盛舉，先後共廿一校。其厚愛工商靑年，無以言喻。從核准名單中得</p>

<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>目前上海灘上有句口頭禪，叫做「死人也弗關」。這是惡毒不過的背辭，罵的人眞太慷他人之槪，而其態度，倒頗寫寫意意的，名之月「弗關」，「超然」也！</p>
<p>「死人也弗關」，不過一句空話而已：在此時此地卻有以行動表現之者。最近幾天表現得挺精彩的，卻在電車上：（一）售票員爲了揩油未成，便老羞成怒，乘電車開行之際，竟把乘客猛力一推，使之跌倒於地，磕傷腦部，血流不止而死；自己卻以一笑了之，「死人也弗關」。（見十六日報載）（二）女乘客抱了孩子走進車廂，因擁擠之故，碰着了賣票，便得飽以老拳，「死人也弗關」，何況中嬰孩面頰？？（見十八日報載）</p>
<p>並非有不共戴天之仇，要人家死；要是不死，也得搭你拚圖明白。然而第三者爲了看不過，例要「關」起來了，結果自己卻脫不了被制裁的干係。</p>
<p>前者（乘客）之死，居然好整以暇，拉鈴「兩下」；然後會「自己」（？）開了車門，從容地跳下？後者區區女流一手抱孩。一手可扯毀賣票高高地戴着的帽子？但不論「推倒」人家的身體與否，「扯毀」自己的帽子與否，終有同車的正義感的證人來鄭重證明其事的。</p>
<p>「死人也弗關」的行動太可惡，然而「活人終難堪」，幸有第三者出而一伸正義。某校學生和某頭等車乘客，能激於義憤，挺身而出，勉爲其難，作此證人，固也應當，在此人家多抱「多一事不如少一事」甚至「死人也弗關」主義之末世，卻已足敦風勤俗的了。冤魂有知，亦必感激無已。</p>
<p>誠然，其他賣票員並非乃天下之烏鴉，是一般黑的。有則改之，無則加勉，如要「袒護同類，帬起侮辱乘客」反而永予人家以墨黑的印象，遂致玉石不分，以爲終是烏鴉了。又：車乘客，起而爲集體糾察，是一種消極的抵抗，惟當局欲根本解決，</p>
<p>，則將何以善其後欺？</p>
<p>社會花絮</p>
<h3>要吃安靜飯進「學生食堂」</h3>
<p>— 蕭文</p>
<p>平米也要賣到一百十七元一擔，一般薪水喈級和學界青年若是照現在行市看來要想塞飽肚皮則非二元莫辦。（這是指不能返家吃飯而言）</p>
<p>上海青年學生食堂就慶這種需要而產生了。這食堂是由青年會的學生救濟委員會主辦的，資金的來源完全由該會籌劃，至於這食堂的目的是便利學界及職業界減低負擔。</p>
<p>這食堂已於九月上旬在四川路五九九號中國青年會二樓正式開幕了。食堂是設在一條走廊，兩旁的板壁都用白漆刷新，三支日　光燈更把走廊照耀得爽朗醒目，壁上還貼着幾種關於各種維他命食料含量比率表及人體重量高度比較表。穿過了短短的走廊，大廳就顯現在眼前，雪白的粉壁和乳白色的桌凳使得這個食堂非常調和，光亮。</p>
<p>學生食堂訂了張食堂公約，最主要的有三項：（一）自拿碗碟（二）遵守秩序（三）保持清潔。</p>
<p>關於管理方面的：這食堂是仿照美國普通餐館的，就是食客們自取碗碟，方法是由食客拿一長方形的白鐵盆，取了碗筷和盆就可以向旁邊排滿了幾大盆當日的菜，由一位侍者依了食客的指定把菜舀入菜盆，然後就請付鈔就膳了。這辦法的優點是：（一）省時省力，（二）食客自己動手免除麻煩。另外對於食堂的管理比較輕鬆，普通食堂總是侍者不斷的來來往往，非得食堂里鳥烟瘴氣，然而學生食堂則不然，所要看到的只有二位舀菜的侍者，一位盛飯的侍者，都穿了白制服，此外就是一位收款員和一位女管理員照料着全個食堂。</p>
<p>關於秩序和清潔也是這食堂的特，普通的食堂都是毫無秩序的喊嚷叫囂，騷音滿室，食客簡直是無一刻安寧，有些更東唾一口痰，西倒一些茶水，弄得不成樣子，但是在青年會學生食堂里這種不良現象是沒有的，一走進了就感到恬靜，要是想吃頓安靜飯，這里倒是一個好塲所！</p>
<p>午晚飯每頓的價錢是一元四角，要是經濟不大寬裕的話，聽說還可以向青年會領取優待券哩！</p>
<h3>裝金人物</h3>
<p>— 琅</p>
<p>下午一時光景「乓」的一聲，亭子間的門關了，「拍拍……」藤鞭落在肉體上；接着是一聯軸器啜泣聲，我推測那不幸者又在挨打了。傍晚，扶梯上很輕的溜下一個熟識的人，別的都不異樣，祇是眼眼腫得像胡桃球：臉上一塊青一塊紫，頭髪短短的，堅在頭頂上，像春天的草地，在黑暗中看起來，簡直不像人，我知道這些都是籐鞭留的痕跡，她開始低訴了：「因爲我告訴了你們今天來的鄉下客人是誰，就遭她這樣的毒打……」，我聽得非常不平，但是還有些氣，更有些好笑，我不信世上會有這樣的笨傢伙！</p>
<p>窮並不可恥；祇要不做賊，不做盜，不做一切傷天害理的事，那末，窮亦何妨？那些人畢竟不凡，上海又是頂講塲面的地方，來了這樣一個土頭土腦的窮親眷，無怪要引爲奇恥大辱了，但假若沒有這個窮親眷來，人家也決不會看重她，祇要一聽她口中的唸唸有「詞」，一望她的尊容，就可確定她是什麼一個刻薄人物了。</p>
<h3>日蝕珍屑</h3>
<p>— 石划</p>
<p>今年的日蝕，其珍貴現象遠非往年可比。據說此類日全蝕的現象，就一地而，每一千年可見三次，每三百六十所可見一次，報載數十年僅見一次，實在尤未足盡其珍貴。</p>
<p>此次日蝕帶，自我國新疆伊犁以南二百里起，經甘肅，青海，福建，至霞浦出海，合計全蝕帶經過之地八省，共一百餘縣。</p>
<p>本年日蝕時間，由十一時十五分起（中原標準時間），歷行中國境內，經四千公里，所需時間，一時有二十分鐘。</p>
<p>此次日蝕，武漢三鎭，適當全蝕帶中心，其時間恰值正午，其現象極注目，朝晦示警，三鎭居民，可以領略該時最嚴重的情形。至於重慶雖不能見全蝕，可見九分。</p>
<p>（編者按）本月二十一日，日全蝕。</p>
<p>掌故譚</p>
<h3>狸案人物志</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>三　李宸妃</p>
<p>李宸妃，杭州人，爲仁宗之生母，劉后之侍婢，眞宗以爲司寢。司寢者，女侍之官也。凡帝王結婚之前，先於宮女中擇稍長者進御，嬪宮中，例有此服務之女侍。即如石頭記中，怡紅院內之襲雯秋麝，亦爲變相的四司。劉后，爲眞宗所最寵愛，李妃，又爲劉后之司寢，故李妃之有孕，眞宗知之；劉后之不能生育，亦豈能瞞過眞宗。小說書造作狸貓換眞珠，以不知李妃爲劉后之宮女也。其時眞宗望子心切，見李妃有孕，熱望其所生爲男子。嘗從臨砌台，李妃之玉釵忽下墜，妃心惡之，帝見其墜，心下如玉釵下墜仍完存，所生當爲男子，及左右取以進，釵果不毀，帝甚喜。已而生仁宗，封崇陽縣君，復生一女，不育。進才人，後爲婉儀。從此段史實，李妃之生仁宗，爲公列之事實，故李妃一生子，即從司寢而封爲縣君，又進而爲才人婉儀，此皆眞宗時代事，若果爲狸貓換太子，李妃尚得享此榮華耶！且不僅宮中知之，皇叔知之（八太保），即大臣亦知之（呂夷簡輩），所不知者，仁宗本人而已。劉后不欲使仁宗知，正爲劉后之權術，亦即大欲存焉！故仁宗乳育，皆由劉后託楊淑妃護視之，楊淑妃本與劉后同列，善奉順劉后，故劉后親信之，奪諸侍婢之手，育之於楊妃，此即劉后不欲使親母撫親子，而隔其母子之情，惟恐異日之奪其位，不服從其命也。雖李妃當仁宗即位，進位順容，而仍嘿處先朝妃嬪中，不欲自異。宮中人皆畏太后，更無敢言者，即毅然示可犯之八太保，尚恐爲劉后所忌，深自沉悔，其他可知矣。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十二　意外風波</p>
<p>「現在你再躺一會，待我出去溜上一兩個鐘頭，再回來跟你一塊兒喝小米粥。」玉崑監視着秋海棠把一大碗藥汁喝下之後，便微笑着向他這樣說。末了又特別找上一句：「今兒我還帶來一大塊金華火腿咧！」</p>
<p>他說出去一兩鐘頭，實際上是直到九點金鐘才回來的。</p>
<p>「怎麼？老三，怪小氣的！五茄皮也不給我買一瓶！」這一次回來，玉崑似乎已不像先前那樣的上心事了，眼望着張老六替他蒸下的一小碟火腿，嘴裏便不住的嚷着要喝酒。</p>
<p>秋海棠今天因爲突然來了這麼一個好友，又喝了一次藥，精神倒委實興奮了許多；當玉崑未回之前，已獨自在坑上靠着喝過半碗小米粥了。</p>
<p>「好，老六，快給二爺去沽四兩五茄上來！」他在裏面的一間屋子裏笑着這樣喊。</p>
<p>「我說你小氣，眞是一些不錯的！四兩酒請誰喝啊！」玉崑一邊說，一邊就丟了一塊錢給張老六。「錢歸我出，喝倒要喝一個痛快！」</p>
<p>待到開始一喝酒之後，玉崑的老脾氣便一古腦兒的全搬出來了。隔着一堵墻壁，秋海棠可以不斷的聽見他在哼着各式各樣的小調，一面還毫無顧忌的和張老六打趣着，從田裏的事一直談到娘兒們的事，什麼話都說得出來。（二一五）</p>

<h3>影星們的愛癖</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>每個人爲了調劑日常生活的枯燥，都不免有幾種愛癖。好萊塢的明星們當然亦不會例外；憑良心說：一般明星的愛癖，大都是可以納入正規的範圍內。下面是拿幾個已成名的明星作一介紹：</p>
<p>茂娜洛埃的業餘時間，差不多大部份是化在她自己的家園內種植花卉，之外，她另有一個果圍，她現在所食的各種蔬菜，據說都是依靠這個果園出產的。</p>
<p>裘蒂珈倫對於音樂一道特別愛好，十餘年來所收集的音樂唱片已近二千餘張。裘蒂還是一個畫家呢，去年她會把一張畫像作爲給她母親的禮物。</p>
<p>瑪琳奧莎麗文在業餘的時聞，唯一的消遣是瀏覽有關於兒童心理學一類的書籍，她認爲要使一個兒童的發育能够滿意，必須先明瞭他的心理，她敎育自己的子女，也是應用此項原理的。</p>
<p>「歌后」珍妮麥唐納喜歡將不論什麼式樣的扇子一概收藏起來。她在親朋之前常常把這些寳物請他們觀賞，最近有一個八十二歲的老影迷拿她自己六十八年前結婚時的一把扇子送給這位歌后；並且還附了一張便條：「因爲你是美人中的代表，所以我今天拿這把象牙刻的扇子送給你。」</p>
<p>米蓋羅納近來在好萊塢眞是紅得不可一世，他因爲正當血氣方剛之時，所以對於一切活動都是興高采烈，在動的方面，乒乓，足球，游泳無一不精，靜的方面他預備寫一本自己的傳記，他的文學作品已經數决在報章雜誌上發表；這樣的一位人才，怪不得欲轟動整個的好萊塢了！</p>

<h3>Unless All Japanese Troops Withdraw from National Territory, China Will Never Cease Fighting: The European War and the Far Eastern War Will Be Resolved Simultaneously; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues a Message to the Nation</h3>
<p>Chongqing: To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Mukden Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek issued a message to the nation, over four thousand characters in length. It recounted the hardship of the people in the Northeast and the deep connection between the four northeastern provinces and the nation. He exhorted the military and civilians across the country to intensify their efforts to achieve the goal of recovering lost territory and to seek liberation for the compatriots in the Northeast. Finally, he emphatically stated that China will not cease fighting until all Japanese troops withdraw from the national territory and sovereignty, territorial integrity, and administrative integrity are restored. (Eighteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: On the eve of the tenth anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a broadcast speech here. In his speech, Chairman Chiang declared that China would not stop fighting until the northeastern territories were recovered. He also declared that if Japan continues to occupy the Northeast, it would be a great danger to the world and would violate the eight principles recently announced by Roosevelt and Churchill. He said that China would never want to divide its own territory, nor would we want to abandon the rich resources of the Northeast, allowing the enemy to benefit from them and threaten the world, and undermine China. Finally, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated that the resolution of the Sino-Japanese War must be resolved simultaneously with the European war, and there is no reason for a separate resolution. (Eighteenth United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing, Eighteenth, International News Service: Yesterday was the eve of the tenth anniversary of the Mukden Incident. Last night, General Chiang Kai-shek broadcast to the entire nation of China, saying, "Resistance will not cease as long as a single invader remains in our country." After stating the purpose of resistance, Chiang asked the people of China not to forget that although the northeastern provinces are temporarily lost, no Chinese territory is actually separated from China. He said, "We will survive together or perish together." In recalling the Mukden Incident, General Chiang said that Japan's intention to conquer Manchuria and Mongolia, and then conquer the world, has long been known to the world. Therefore, under the leadership of Roosevelt and Hull, the United States has shifted from a policy of non-recognition to economic sanctions and expanded aid to China. He also said, "We fight for the independence and survival of the Chinese nation and the integrity of our administration and land, so that we can be free from the threats we now face and that China can enjoy freedom and equality in the East and in a world that can be called just and peaceful. I deeply believe that the nations opposing Japan will intensify their encirclement of Japan, and I further believe that the final failure of Japan is about to begin. Today, commemorating the dark era of ten years ago can inspire us."</p>
<p>Tokyo, Eighteenth, Haitong News Agency: Asahi Shimbun reports that a report from Hong Kong says that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has sent a letter to U.S. President Roosevelt, detailing the important role that China's war effort plays between the democracies and the Axis powers. He also expressed great concern about any solution to the Pacific issue and therefore wishes to be informed of the progress of U.S.-Japan talks at any time.</p>
<h3>Chinese Guerrillas in Northeastern Territory Number 400,000; Divided into Four War Zones, Li Du Is Commander-in-Chief; Contact Has Been Established with Chinese Troops in Northern Hebei</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to General Li Du, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Volunteer Army in Manchuria, now in Chongqing, the Chinese guerrilla forces in Manchuria consist of twelve armies, currently numbering 400,000. In 1936, a meeting was convened to elect Li as Commander-in-Chief to coordinate the actions of the various armies. Manchuria is divided into four war zones: (1) Eastern Liaoning, (2) Eastern Jilin, (3) Southern Jilin, and (4) Northern Heilongjiang, with Yang Jingyu, Li Yanlu, Zhou Baozhong, and Zhao Sanji (all transliterated) serving as commanders, respectively. The original seven armies have been expanded to the current twelve armies, totaling 400,000 men, of whom 50% are farmers, 20% are soldiers, 15% are workers, and 5% are intellectuals. It is also reported that the Chinese Volunteer Army in Manchuria has established contact with the main force of the Chinese army in northern Hebei. (Seventeenth Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fighting in Southwestern Area of Dayun Mountain Comes to an End: Japanese Withdraw Troops, Attempting Complete Destruction; Chinese Troops Are Carrying Out Post-War Work</h3>
<p>Somewhere: Chinese troops swept the Japanese forces in the southwestern area of Dayun Mountain on the north bank of the upper reaches of the Xinqiang River. After days of bloody fighting, it has come to an end. The scattered Japanese troops in the area have all been eliminated. On the seventeenth, Chinese troops are engaged in post-war work such as clearing the battlefield and comforting refugees. This was because the main force of a certain Japanese division invaded southward from northern Hunan, with the aim of covering the withdrawal of troops, and attempting to inflict a fatal blow on the Chinese troops before the withdrawal of troops, reducing the threat to the periphery of Yuezhou. Chinese troops used the principle of magnetic warfare to attract the Japanese troops, fought bloodily for ten days, not only causing the main force of a certain Japanese division to be almost completely lost, but also completely crushing the Japanese attempt to withdraw troops. (Seventeenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Hunan: In this encirclement and suppression of the areas south of Dayun Mountain such as Tuanshan Port, the Chinese troops fought bloodily for five days and nights, and were finally severely damaged by the Chinese troops. It has now been verified that the Japanese casualties were extremely numerous, and the Chinese troops seized countless military supplies. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde: The Japanese troops gathered in the Bailuoji area have been fleeing in all directions for days, and have been severely attacked by the Chinese troops, suffering heavy casualties. Most of them have already fled from Chenglingji back to northeastern Yueyang (Fifteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: At midnight on the ninth, over a thousand Japanese troops from Jincheng harassed the Zhenmaliangzhuang area in the northeast, engaging in fierce fighting with a certain unit of the Chinese army for a whole day.

<h3>Bomb Explodes at Nanjing Station</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Yesterday, a hand grenade exploded at Xiaguan Station here, killing six people, including one Japanese civilian, and wounding seventeen people, including one Japanese military policeman. The explosion occurred at 3:00 p.m. The hand grenade was hidden in a passenger's luggage.

Therefore, passengers traveling south from Beiping yesterday could not reach Nanjing and had to spend the night in Pukou. (Eighteenth, Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Delivers Important Speech</h3>
<p>London: Chinese Ambassador to Britain Gu Weijun delivered a speech at a luncheon of the New Commonwealth Society here today, asking that the Far Eastern situation not be ignored when drafting any permanent peace plan. He said, "The current situation seems to focus on the European aspects of general problems. I feel slightly uneasy about this concentration on maintaining peace in Europe. The terrible torrent in the West today is not unrelated to what happened in the Far East ten years ago. Failure to curb the violence and disturbances against the peace-loving Chinese people undoubtedly encouraged the forces of aggression in Europe." (Eighteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northeastern Compatriots in Chongqing Hold Commemorative Meeting Yesterday; Torchlight Parade Held Afterwards; Various Circles in Chongqing Also Expanded Commemoration</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Northeastern compatriots in Chongqing held a "September 18th" tenth anniversary commemoration this afternoon, with over 300 people attending. General Li Du presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. Other guests also gave speeches, unanimously stating that no Japanese troops should be allowed to remain in Chinese territory. The most moving scenes at the meeting were the two horizontal banners at the entrance, "Return to Our Old Home" and "Support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek" above the auditorium. After the meeting, various circles in Chongqing held a commemorative meeting, with over 10,000 people attending. Liu Zhi presided over the meeting, and Wu Zhihui and others gave speeches. A torchlight parade was then held from the meeting place to the Central Party Headquarters to pay tribute to the President before disbanding. (Eighteenth Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today is the tenth anniversary of the September 18th Incident. The consensus of all opinions is that China will fight until the lost territories of the four northeastern provinces are recovered. All morning newspapers carried Chairman Chiang's pronouncements, restating China's war aims: (1) to defend China's territorial and administrative integrity; (2) to uphold international justice and defeat aggression. The Chongqing Women's and Youth League gave speeches along the way all day long, comforting the people. The government will not stop fighting until there is not a single Japanese soldier within the national border. After the mass meeting, over ten thousand people held torches and shouted slogans, parading through the major streets. The compatriots from the four northeastern provinces issued a declaration, stating that the four northeastern provinces are China's lifeline, and that the recovery of lost territories is the main condition for resolving the war. Various cultural organizations, such as the People's Foreign Affairs Committee, jointly sent telegrams to friendly nations, urging them to continue to aid China and declaring China's determination to stop fighting only after its land and administrative power are fully restored. The Shishi Xinbao published an article stating that the provincial governments of the four northeastern provinces have now been formed, hoping that the authorities will go to the four northeastern provinces as soon as possible to organize the people, train motorcades, and command guerrilla warfare. It also suggested that the National Government officially recognize the four northeastern provinces as one of the war zones and appoint a pacification director for the Northeast to command the war in that area. (Eighteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Myanmar to Australia Forms Arc-Shaped Line: Brooke-Popham Discusses Cooperation Between Britain and the Dutch East Indies; Sufficient to Cope with Any Future Contingency</h3>
<p>Singapore, 78th, Reuters: British Commander-in-Chief in the Far East Brooke-Popham and British Fleet Commander in China Leighton held a joint press conference yesterday. Brooke-Popham claimed that the British side was not concerned about the threat of a blockade, as there were sufficient food and munitions. He did not believe that a blockade could last for six months, but even without the help of the U.S. Navy, the British side would be able to completely break it before six months. When asked about his recent tour of the Dutch East Indies, Brooke-Popham replied that as far as he could see, the Dutch East Indies were well prepared and very satisfactory. The Dutch East Indies certainly did not want to trample on civilian crops, but if attacked, the Dutch East Indies would be determined to make a statement and would not give in. When asked whether the British and the Dutch East Indies had held staff talks or made any arrangements, Brooke-Popham replied that he had said at the last press conference that from Myanmar to Australia, an arc had been formed with shared interests. If an incident occurred in one place in this area, other places would also be affected, as these countries were inseparable. "I have said all I can say, and I cannot continue to elaborate." When asked whether Malaya would immediately rise up to help if the Dutch East Indies were attacked, Brooke-Popham replied that he would follow the orders of the British government and that, thanks to Duff Cooper's efforts, the British government would make a rapid decision. When asked about Thailand, Brooke-Popham said that the relationship between Malaya and Thailand was now better than before. Thailand now knew that we were its friends and therefore hoped that we would provide guidance and send two military officers to inspect our defenses and the work of our fighter squadrons. This was something he thought impossible a few months ago. Thailand has begun to show a kind of independence towards Japan, and they are gradually realizing that they should not be too economically or financially dependent on Japan. Rear Admiral Leighton told reporters that the rumor broadcast by radio that a pirate ship had been found in the Pacific and had destroyed many ships was untrue.</p>
<p>Canberra, Eighteenth, Reuters: Australian Prime Minister Fadden warned the people not to become complacent because the main war damage may continue to be far away from Australia in a few weeks or months, as the shift of war damage is only temporary. The Australian Prime Minister also said that the Australian government recognized that the mutual adjustment of British and American Far Eastern policies was extremely important. He believed that there had been no fundamental changes in the situation in the past month, and Australians must continue to prepare to prevent sudden changes in the war and force Australians to actively defend themselves near their own coastline. Australia has formally invited Duff Cooper to set up headquarters in Singapore and visit Australia as soon as possible to the extent possible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Department Issues Article Commemorating "September 18th": Actually Positions Itself as Leader; Exposes Ambition to Dominate</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Eighteenth, United Press: Officials of the Japanese Army Ministry recently issued an article stating that the Manchurian Incident and the current Sino-Japanese War are both "racial wars" with the aim of liberating Eastern races and allowing them to escape the oppression of white people. The official said in the article that Japan is the leader of the Eastern races, and therefore Japan has decided to fight to the end. The Japanese "Kochiho," which often reflects the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published this article in a prominent position. The author of this article is Fuminaga, director of the press department of the Army Ministry, which was written to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Manchurian Incident. Fuminaga criticized the so-called ABCD "aggressive front" for increasingly tightening its encirclement of Japan, and said that in order to realize the "New Order in East Asia," it is necessary for Japan to obtain raw materials from the Dutch East Indies. "If any country forces the Dutch East Indies to reject Japan's legitimate demands and stop transporting raw materials, this move will become a serious issue related to Japan's survival. Japan will one day make them understand the folly of their plans. The glorious history and mission of the Yamato nation will never allow its country to remain in a position of being restricted and economically oppressed. It will not allow any situation to exist that would cause Japan to be economically impoverished to death." Fuminaga also said that the victory of the China Incident can build a larger "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and allow the Japanese people to engage in the greatest undertaking. Fuminaga also said that he believes that "our country's national strength and military power will never be overthrown and will remain very stable and suitable for a great power. Today is the time for Japan to move forward and break through any obstacles in its path."</p>
<p>Tokyo, Eighteenth, United Press: The "Asahi Shimbun" today, on the tenth anniversary of the start of the Manchurian Incident, criticized the anti-Axis countries for aiding the Chinese government in an attempt to delay the China Incident, thereby deliberately hindering peace in East Asia. The newspaper said, "Their formation of an encirclement front is intended to coerce us." The newspaper said that the current possible crisis is the most serious since withdrawing from the League of Nations. The "Kokumin Shimbun" advocated that the reasons for the Mukden Incident must be re-recognized and said, "We must revitalize our fighting spirit to cope with the current situation so as to eliminate the causes of future difficulties and disputes."</p>

<h3>Bank of England Re-elects Directors; Governor Will Not Change</h3>
<p>London, Eighteenth, Reuters: At a meeting of the Board of Directors of the Bank of England today, Governor Norman announced that the positions of Governor and Deputy Governor of the Bank would not change in April next year.

According to the regulations of the Bank of England, after the age of seventy, employees are not allowed to participate in re-election unless there are special circumstances. However, in view of the fact that the majority of possible candidates are either in military service or serving the country in other capacities, it was decided that those who must retire in April next year will be allowed to be re-elected. The Bank's Governor Norman, born in 1871, is also affected by the above regulations. Mr. Norman has been Governor since 1920 and is the longest-serving governor in history.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>American Announces Implementation of Convoy Escorts</h3>
<p>In response to Nazi provocations at sea, U.S. President Roosevelt announced in a broadcast on the evening of the 11th that he had ordered the U.S. Navy to shoot at Axis vessels when they appeared in the U.S. defense waters, to protect all American and other national vessels doing business in U.S. defense waters from attacks by submarines and surface raiders. This already constitutes a de facto convoy escort, although he did not explicitly use the word "convoy." However, the night before, U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, in a conversation with reporters, formally announced the U.S. Navy's implementation of convoy escorts to ensure the safe arrival of supplies for Britain. This is a further step toward war for the United States, following the passage of the Lend-Lease Act and the expansion of the patrol system.</p>
<p>The consistent policy of the United States regarding the current European war is to ensure that war materials reach Britain to promote British victory, while avoiding direct participation in the war itself. Among these two conditions, the former is absolute, and all possible means will be taken to ensure its fulfillment; the latter is relative, and the attitude will be determined by the objective situation at any time. If there is a real necessity, avoiding participation is not an absolutely unshakeable principle. A year ago, opposition to joining the war did indeed have great influence in the United States, so that President Roosevelt had to specially emphasize the principle of avoiding involvement in the war in his fireside chat at the end of last year and in his State of the Union address at the beginning of this year. In the course of this year, from aiding Britain to expanding patrols to implementing convoy escorts, approaching the brink of war step by step, the voices against joining the war have become increasingly silenced. Even those who stubbornly cling to the old ways, like Colonel Lindbergh, are not enough to stir up public opinion. This major change is naturally due to the efforts of the U.S. authorities and the people's awareness, but the biggest reason is still the Nazis' aggressive and encroaching nature, which leaves no room for isolationist and pacifist views. Moreover, although Britain has suffered defeats, its strength remains intact. In terms of the current international situation, there is already considerable confidence in principle in defeating the Nazis. Although the United States is increasingly increasing its obligations and responsibilities for the European war, it is very different from having to seek positive action because of the collapse of British power. This is why the convoy action can be announced and implemented so smoothly without any resistance.</p>
<p>Since Roosevelt announced his determination to clear Axis warships appearing in U.S. territorial waters, the Axis side has been constantly furious, but the repeated attacks on American ships that had occurred before have temporarily disappeared. On the other hand, until now, there has been no news of Axis warships being sunk or captured by the U.S. escort fleet. If the calm situation in the Atlantic these days is not accidental, then it is probably because the Nazis have recognized the difficulty and retreated under the firm response of the U.S. side. In April and May of this year, Germany's raiding policy did have some effect in the Atlantic for a time, with a record of sinking more than 400,000 tons of British ships per week (according to German figures), and it was rumored that 40% of American war supplies to Britain were sunk on the bottom of the Atlantic. However, according to British Prime Minister Churchill's report in the House of Commons on the 9th of this month, the situation in the Atlantic has greatly improved. On the one hand, the loss of British and Allied ships has greatly decreased, and on the other hand, the loss of German and Italian ships in June, July, and August has increased sharply. In July and August, the number of British and Allied ships sunk by German attacks was less than one-third of the number of German and Italian ships lost to British aircraft and submarines. According to this, Germany's raiding strength at sea should be insufficient to cope with Britain, let alone the addition of the vast U.S. fleet. The warships currently used by the United States for convoy escorts in the Atlantic are probably mainly the Atlantic Fleet that previously performed patrol missions, totaling more than 120 warships. Except for three old battleships and four heavy cruisers, about two-thirds or more are light destroyers and submarines, plus the cooperation of the air force, which is precisely configured to deal with German raiding. According to U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox the night before last, convoy methods are constantly changing, and the United States is now fully adopting these new methods. Even if Germany's submarine and aircraft production is amazing, it is difficult to cultivate talent. In the midst of its own encirclement, it is unwise to arbitrarily consume a large amount of strength under the joint guard of the British and American navies and air forces, and in reality cannot achieve the effect of cutting off American war supplies to Britain. Therefore, it is expected that after the U.S. Navy implements convoy escorts, the raiding operations in the Atlantic will not disappear completely, but they will not be a cause for concern. Unless there are more significant changes, the United States can still continue to maintain its traditional policy of avoiding direct participation in the war.</p>
<p>If the German side's intensification of attacks on American transport ships in recent days was to disrupt the U.S.-Japan negotiations and coerce Japan to express its attitude toward its Axis alliance obligations, then this intention can be said to have completely failed. The U.S.-Japan negotiations will certainly not have any results, but that is not due to the disruptive power of the Germans. Furthermore, Japan's recent lukewarm attitude toward the Tripartite Pact cannot be reversed by any German posture unless Germany wins a decisive victory. From this point alone, there is no need for the Nazi attacks on American ships to continue to expand.</p>
<h3>Knox Officially Announces U.S. Navy Implementation of Convoy Escorts to Ensure the Safe Transport of Supplies to Britain; German Raiders' Activities Under Search</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - The U.S. Navy is now adopting convoy methods to ensure the safe transport of supplies to Britain, as announced by Secretary of the Navy Knox last night. Knox told reporters that naval convoy escorts are just one of the many methods available and currently used. Since the last great war, more convoy methods have been invented, and the United States is now fully adopting them. When asked if U.S. warships escort ships to Iceland and hand them over to the British Navy there, Knox replied that it would be unwise to speak in detail about this matter.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 18th - Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox told reporters yesterday that the United States will protect ships of any nationality carrying supplies provided under the Lend-Lease Act. Colonel Knox also said that the Navy Department believes that a German raider is operating along the Panama Canal in the South Pacific, and this ship is apparently using the Galapagos Islands as a base. Colonel Knox replied to inquiries, "We believe that there must be a raider there, and a ship is missing. This is our only information." He said that the Navy Department had searched the Pacific islands several months ago for islands that could be used as raider bases. He said that the Navy Department is still continuing to search the islands off South America for possible raider bases. Regarding convoy escorts, Knox told questioners, "You can still recall that since the First World War, many other new methods besides convoy escorts have been invented to protect ships. We have used all these new methods." Knox refused to say whether the Navy Department also protects all merchant ships in the North Atlantic, but he admitted that the possibility of arming merchant ships is being officially discussed. However, he also stated that Congress will be required to pass this measure, and he himself has not yet decided. Colonel Knox admitted that the lack of guns is the main problem regarding the arming of merchant ships. Knox said that naval guns and sailors can be used when needed. Colonel Knox also said that in recent days, there have been no reports of conflicts with German aircraft. When asked whether the Navy Department also provides convoy escorts for ships carrying war materials to Britain and Iceland, Knox replied, "Convoy escorts with warships are one of all methods. This method will be used in all our defense areas."</p>
<h3>U.S. Coast Guard Ships Participate in Convoy Escorts; First Cargo Ship Arrives in Lisbon</h3>

<h3>U.S. Loans Large Sum to Soviet Union, 100 Million Gold Dollars for Purchasing War Materials</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - The United States is now providing the Soviet Union with 100 million U.S. dollars to purchase war materials in the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 18th - Federal Loan Administrator Jones released President Roosevelt's letter regarding the Soviet loan as follows: The Soviet government now needs U.S. dollars to purchase war materials in the United States. We now need many types of raw materials produced by the Soviet Union that are critical to the military. In peacetime, we used to import some from that country. Now, to help the Soviet government pay for the war materials it wants to purchase in the United States, and now we can only obtain a limited amount of the price of goods, and to facilitate our security procedures, I now wish you to purchase manganese, chromium, asbestos, platinum, and other items and raw materials from the Soviet Amtorg Corporation through the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation or one of its subsidiary organizations, up to 100 million U.S. dollars, and deliver the goods as soon as possible. Those who need subsidies for transportation and convenience of production should be given an appropriate amount, and 50 million U.S. dollars can be prepaid to offset the price of purchasing these raw materials critical to the military, so that the Soviet Union can use them to purchase various goods in the United States. Jones told reporters that the Defense Supplies Corporation, assisted by the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation, yesterday signed a contract with Amtorg Corporation to purchase 100 million U.S. dollars worth of manganese, chromium, asbestos, and platinum. He also said that the Defense Supplies Corporation will prepay 50 million U.S. dollars for the price of these raw materials, so that the Soviet Union can use them to purchase various goods in the United States. Ten million U.S. dollars have been paid out yesterday according to the contract, and the remaining funds will be paid at any time when the Soviet Union needs them.</p>
<h3>Nazi Spy Case Opens in U.S.; Sebold's Testimony</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 18th - German-American spy Paul Sebold testified yesterday during the court trial of the Nazi spy network that five months before the U.S. occupied Iceland, a German agent had told him that the U.S. would send 30,000 troops and 4,000 officers to Greenland and Iceland. He also said that most of the funds Germany sent to the U.S. to support spies were intercepted by the U.S. Bureau of Investigation, so spies in the U.S. earned very little. Investigator Friedman testified that he had eavesdropped on conversations between Duquesne and Sebold. Duquesne wanted to blow up a General Electric plant somewhere in New York State. Duquesne himself said that he had inspected the plant a year ago and felt that it was best to blow it up with a bomb made of lead pipes, using slow-burning gunpowder fuse, because it was silent. The Bureau of Investigation secretly filmed up to 200 feet of film to show Duquesne's situation in Sebold's office. Note that Duquesne is one of the defendants, a native of Cape Town, South Africa, who has become a U.S. citizen and claims to be an internationally renowned writer and speaker.</p>
<h3>U.S. Speeds Up Shipbuilding Program</h3>

<h3>U.S. Huge Tax Bill Passes Senate</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 18th - The U.S. Senate yesterday passed the largest tax bill in U.S. history, the $3,553,400,000 tax bill, and sent it to President [Roosevelt - implied] for signature.

<h3>Soviet Forces Achieve Major Victory Northeast of Smolensk; Battle for Leningrad Becomes More Cautious and Intense; German Offensive in South Again Defeated</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 18th - Soviet forces launched a fierce counterattack and drove back the Axis forces attacking Odessa. The Soviet news agency announced this, saying that the Axis forces attacking Odessa broke through the Soviet lines and occupied several heights west of Darnia. Soviet infantry, assisted by Soviet warships, launched a counterattack. After fierce fighting for several hours, the heights changed hands several times, but the German forces were finally driven back to their original positions, abandoning many dead and wounded German soldiers.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - Soviet forces have recently achieved major victories in Yazhivo, 35 miles northeast of Smolensk, and Odessa on the Black Sea coast. In the Leningrad area, German forces have intensified their pressure, while Soviet forces are fiercely resisting on land, sea, and air, and the battle situation is becoming more intense. A recent dispatch from Moscow described the Red Army recovering a village at a crossroads leading to Leningrad. It is said that German forces intended to launch a new offensive from this village. Soviet land forces, assisted by the firing of Soviet warships, rushed into the village regardless of their own safety. The fighting was very fierce, and the village was finally recaptured. German forces suffered heavy losses. Now, fresh German troops are being sent to the front line and concentrating artillery fire to break through the resistance of the Leningrad defenders. There is also fighting off the Gulf of Finland, far from Leningrad. German forces have repeatedly attempted to occupy the island of Osel and other islands controlling the southern entrances to the Gulf of Riga and the Gulf of Finland. It is generally believed that the Soviet victory in Yazhivo, killing 10,000 enemies and capturing many artillery pieces, is extremely important, because the Soviet forces are thus able to surround Smolensk and defeat the German hope of continuing to attack Moscow from this area. Soviet forces in the Ukrainian region launched a fierce counterattack and drove back the Axis forces by several miles.</p>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 18th - The good news of the Soviet forces' overall victory has just been reported, and yesterday it was announced again that a village near Leningrad, which German forces intended to use as an elastic springboard to directly attack Leningrad, had been recaptured by Soviet forces after fierce fighting. Official reports said that as a result of the Soviet forces' fierce attack, German forces suffered more than 30,000 casualties. Marshal Moshenko's troops in the central area have recaptured Yazhivo, 30 miles north of Smolensk, and are now preparing to recapture Smolensk to eliminate the German threat to Moscow. A Soviet spokesman said that the German attacks on Leningrad and Odessa are very urgent, which shows that the German forces are eager to succeed in at least one place before winter. The Soviet High Command said that another German force attempted to land on Osel Island, but were all repelled by the Soviet Navy and buried in the Baltic Sea. The control of the Gulf of Finland is still in Soviet hands.</p>

<h3>Bulgaria Makes Request to Turkey; Permission for Warships to Pass Through Straits; Turkey Will Certainly Reject It</h3>
<p>United Press, Ankara, 18th - Bulgaria has requested Turkey to allow Bulgaria to pass eight destroyers, four submarines, and one torpedo boat through the Dardanelles Strait.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th - The British government has no definite confirmation regarding the rumors that Bulgaria has been asked to allow Italian warships to pass through the Dardanelles under the Bulgarian flag. According to information obtained by a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the British view is already very clear, that any such attempt would be a means to undermine the provisions of the Montreux Convention. Although Britain is not at war with Bulgaria, the Axis powers cannot invoke the non-belligerent clause in the Montreux Convention, because Bulgaria has at least been genuinely fighting with Greece and Yugoslavia, two of Britain's allies. Therefore, there is no reason to doubt that the Turkish government will firmly reject it.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Expresses Dissatisfaction with Bulgaria's Reply; Families of Soviet Embassy Staff Withdraw from Sofia</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 18th - On the 17th, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov met with Bulgarian Envoy to the Soviet Union Staminov. During the conversation, the Bulgarian Envoy handed Molotov a reply from the Bulgarian government. In the reply, the Bulgarian government denied the facts protested by the Soviet government, and also denied that Bulgaria was disloyal to the Soviet Union and that Bulgaria was used as a base for attacking the Soviet Union. Molotov told the Bulgarian Envoy that the Soviet Union was not satisfied with the Bulgarian government's reply, because the reply did not refute the points raised in the Soviet note.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 18th - According to a German border dispatch published in this morning's "Daily Express," Turkey is in a "position to be invaded by Germany," because Hitler urgently needs oil and needs a shortest route to the Caucasus oil fields of the Soviet Union.

<h3>British Policy Towards Turkey: Loyalty to Alliance Unwavering; Increased Trade Relations Between the Two Countries; Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 18th. British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, delivered a speech yesterday at the Izmir Fair. The audience included the Mayor of Izmir, Turkish military and civilian authorities, business leaders, consular officials, and expatriates from Allied countries. The Ambassador stated that the Anglo-Turkish alliance will always be the foundation of British policy towards Turkey. During his first year in Turkey, he had said that Britain's commercial and financial policy towards Turkey was a long-term policy. Today, he believes this statement has been validated and can guarantee that it will prove to be accurate in the future. Despite facing various difficulties and dedicating all its efforts to the greatest struggle in history to fight for the freedom of its own country and the entire world, Britain is still participating in this fair. The best illustration of Britain's trade policy towards Turkey can be seen in the figures for British purchases from Turkey in 1938, 1939, and 1940. The total value of British purchases from Turkey in these three years was £2,817,000, £6,387,000, and £35,402,000 Turkish pounds, respectively. This does not include purchases made from Turkey by British private merchants. In the past few weeks alone, British goods worth £10,000,000 have been shipped to Turkey. Britain plans to purchase olive oil, wool, dried fruits, and other goods worth £20,000,000. There is also an agreement between Britain and Turkey for Britain to provide gold to meet Turkey's needs. From the sales figures, it is clear that Britain is truly committed to increasing trade with Turkey. This trade is not temporary or transitional or due to the war, but a foundation for permanent mutual relations. He believes that Anglo-Turkish trade will continue to increase.</p>
<h3>Three Swedish Destroyers Experience Mysterious Explosion; Fuel Spreads on Water Surface, City Ablaze; Over Forty Dead and Injured; Cause Under Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>United Press, Stockholm, 18th. On Tuesday, three Swedish destroyers berthed at the Muskö naval base were bombed, caught fire, and sank. It is reported that 31 people died and 11 were injured. However, after the incident, burning oil from the fire spread across the harbor's surface, creating a sea of flames, making rescue impossible. The number of deaths is feared to be higher. The three destroyers sunk were the "Gothenburg," displacing 1,040 tons, the "Klas Horn," displacing 1,020 tons, and the "Klas Uggla," displacing 1,020 tons. When the three ships met with disaster, many of the 600 crew members were on leave and spared. It is believed the explosions were caused either by careless handling of torpedoes or an accident in the boiler room.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 18th. Yesterday's tragedy involving the Swedish destroyers is an unprecedented military catastrophe in Sweden during peacetime. The Swedish destroyer "Gothenburg" in Hårsfjärden suddenly exploded, and nearby warships were also affected. Explosions occurred one after another within half an hour, and the arsenal on the nearby island of Mälsten was also engulfed in flames. Soldiers on the island temporarily took refuge in air-raid shelters. The first explosion on the "Gothenburg" broke the ship into two sections, and it immediately sank. The fire spread to nearby warships, including the cruisers "Klas Horn," "Klas Uggla," and the minelayer "Fleming," which were damaged. One transport ship was also destroyed.</p>
<p>International News Service, Stockholm, 18th. The government is investigating the cause of the explosion of the three destroyers. Officials are currently silent on the matter, as the government fears it may involve international relations.</p>
<h3>Former German Finance Minister Dies in France</h3>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 18th.

Hilferding had lived in France since the beginning of the Nazi regime and was arrested after the armistice.</p>
<h3>New Iranian King Sworn In; Adopts Constitutional Monarchy; British and Soviet Troops Enter Tehran</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th. A BBC correspondent in Delhi stated that British troops have entered the Iranian capital, Tehran. Moscow Radio also announced that Soviet troops have entered the city. Staff officers from both British and Soviet forces entered the city yesterday morning. It is reported that some Soviet troops parachuted in. The new Iranian King was sworn into office yesterday afternoon in parliament, taking an oath to the constitution. His first act after taking office was to comply with the wishes of the former king and order the dismissal of the police chief, as he had tried his best to obstruct the arrest of German nationals. The first group of Germans being sent to India for detention have reportedly boarded ships at a certain port in the Persian Gulf. The Bulgarian embassy in Tehran has been closed. The new king will formally receive all diplomatic personnel in Tehran in the coming days.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tehran, 18th. Iranian Prime Minister Foroughi declared in parliament yesterday that Allied troops were advancing towards Tehran. The Iranian government requested that they not approach the capital, hoping this request would be effective. However, even if Allied troops reach the capital, members of parliament should be at ease, as the Allied troops have no hostile intentions. This is the assurance that the Allied troops have given us, and we deeply believe that this assurance can be trusted. The Prime Minister also stated that the new king had instructed him to explain that the new king would rule Iran under a completely constitutional monarchy. The new king will abide by the constitution, respect the rights of the Iranian people, obey all laws that have been passed or will be passed by parliament, and will do his best to correct any individual or collective misdeeds against the people. The new king will also try to fulfill all the hopes of the people and will grant parliament all facilities to establish a committee of experts to verify his guarantee that the royal jewelry is safely stored in the National Bank of Tehran.</p>
<p>Nationwide Resentment; The Former King's Abdication</p>
<p>Reuters, Tehran, 17th. Iranian King Reza Shah, who reigned for 16 years, ruled with administrative autocracy, nearly resulting in a popular uprising. He was eventually forced to abdicate due to the demands of the people. Although senior military officers, due to their positions and benefits, still considered supporting him, the soldiers resented him, and the people were divided. When cabinet members entered the palace on Monday night to request his abdication, Reza Shah refused, hoping that the army could help him and that the British and Soviets would not intervene. He later sent someone to meet with British Ambassador Bullard to seek his opinion. After learning that the British side would not provide assistance, he realized that his power was gone. On Tuesday, he summoned cabinet members to the Winter Palace and presented them with the abdication edict. The matter was initially kept secret to prevent unrest, but the news spread throughout the capital. Countless people gathered in front of the radio to listen to the official announcement. After his abdication, Reza Shah set off for Isfahan, a city 220 miles to the south, which is a center of ancient Persian art and culture. The wealth that Reza Shah had accumulated over the years was considerable. Some of it had already been shipped to the United States and Britain, and it is not yet known whether he will take the rest with him.</p>
<p>British Troops Control Iran; Strengthen Position in the Near East</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th. German newspapers have recently acknowledged that it was foolish to underestimate Britain's victory in Iran. One German newspaper stated that Britain now controls Iran's important oil regions, and it must be recognized that Britain's overall strategic position in the Near East has been greatly strengthened.</p>
<h3>300 British Aircraft Attack Northern France; Power Plant Hit, Fires Erupt</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th. Yesterday afternoon, over 300 British fighter planes flew to northern France on a large-scale offensive operation, escorting two large squadrons of Blenheim bombers to attack a power plant in the Marcin-Gaillard area near Péronne in northeastern France. The target was hit, and fires erupted. German aircraft attempted to intercept but failed. At least six were shot down. The British lost one bomber and seven fighter planes. The Air Ministry's Information Office stated that the Marcin-Gaillard power plant is quite important, as it not only has a large power station but also manufactures synthetic oil and ammonia.</p>
<h3>Two Columns of German Troops Cross Border, Invade Egyptian Territory</h3>
<p>Repulsed to Original Position After Fierce Attack by South African Troops; Cairo Air Raid Incites Muslim Resentment</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 18th. Two columns of German troops crossed the border and entered 35 miles into Egyptian territory for reconnaissance, but were forced to retreat. They were pursued by South African armored vehicles and British troops. The German troops have now retreated to their original positions. British and South African patrols are currently in contact with them. This is the first time that South African troops have engaged Axis forces since arriving in Egypt.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 18th. The Egyptian Minister of Defense formally announced last night that Cairo was subjected to an air raid on Tuesday morning, stating that the Axis powers' bombing of Cairo has caused deep resentment among Egyptians and Muslims worldwide, as Muslims regard Cairo as a holy city holding the torch of Islam. I believe that the monuments and sacred religious tombs of Cairo are historical treasures recognized by all who have even a little understanding of civilization. It is unfortunate that some who claim to be civilized have disregarded these beliefs. The people of Cairo remained calm during the air raid, which the government deeply appreciates.</p>
<h3>General Wavell's Whereabouts in the Near East</h3>

<h3>Yarn Flowers: Yarn Market Originally Followed Horse's Lead, Now Flies Behind Phoenix's Tail; Both Futures Yarn Markets Follow Blue Phoenix</h3>
<p>The spot yarn market has been closed since September 18th, but the Shuangma Factory's exchange office is still operating as usual. The opening price was 1,752 yuan, a sharp increase of 9 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. As soon as this price opened, sellers rushed in, and the market loosened, falling to 1,744 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the exchange market price was trending downward step by step, and people's hearts were ordinary. Therefore, the Shuangma factory's orders fluctuated for a long time, but the momentum became more vigorous, returning to 1,747-48 yuan. Although most of the Guangbang merchants still arrived on the market, there were no transactions for the purchase of spot yarn. Until after 11 o'clock, rumors suddenly arose in the market, saying that cash had risen slightly and foreign exchange had shrunk slightly. As a result, various parties suddenly became active, and the price immediately reached 1,752 yuan. Unexpectedly, as the price rose, profit-takers began to sell, and the market loosened, falling to 1,741 yuan. The closing price was 1,743 yuan. It is estimated that about 8,000 bales were traded in half a day. The afternoon opened at 1,740 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange's prices for all months fell by 7-8 yuan to 10 yuan, people's hearts were timid, and the price gradually fell to 1,734 yuan. Some scalpers covered their positions, and the price rose again to 1,740 yuan. However, the environment was unfavorable, and the closing price fell again to 1,736 yuan. Regarding the current situation of Shuangma, some say that the exchange's previous month was squeezed down to 1,610 yuan, while the Shuangma price was 1,770 yuan. Currently, the exchange's current month is only 1,510 yuan, which is 100 yuan lower than the previous month's price. However, the difference between Shuangma and Lanfeng's marked yarn is different. The rise and fall of the market still depends on whether the actual position is progressing or not.</p>
<p>The Jinshuangma futures market situation is volatile, and it still has not shown a very strong trend. Because the hopes of all parties have not made any progress, large investors cannot help but be cautious. The market is quiet and hesitant. When it opened in the morning, the factory's orders opened high due to the rebound of American cotton, and the bulls followed suit to collect. The futures yarn market was active, with more demand than supply for a time, so both near and distant months rose. In the middle, because the exchange was upstream, the September contract once rose to 1,664 yuan, the October contract rose to 1,676 yuan, and the November contract also rose to 1,684 yuan. After entering, scattered bulls sold one after another, and there were differences again. The midday closing was near-month rising and distant-month falling. In the afternoon, as the exchange turned weak, the factory's orders also showed a soft trend. People's hearts were uneasy, and there was a rush to sell. The September contract fell to 1,656 yuan, the October contract fell slightly to 1,665 yuan, and the November contract also fell to 1,677 yuan. By the time of closing, it was slightly firmer, returning half a yuan to three yuan. As a result of the fluctuations throughout the day, there was no change in the near-term, the October contract fell by half a yuan, and the November contract was squeezed down by four yuan. The following is a table of transaction prices:</p>
<h3>Borrowing the Theme of New Cotton; Coarse Lint Jumps Six or Seven Yuan</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still good. Although factories do not have an urgent need, people are concerned that the new cotton crop will be bad and expensive. In fact, even if it is bad, Chinese coarse lint may smoothly flow into the hands of Chinese people. This is just using the bad situation to peddle speculation. Therefore, the industry's view is still good. As for applying for foreign exchange, the government will certainly allow it for industrial raw materials, but speculators will be severely hit, so there will be no fear for future raw materials. Yesterday, there were many transactions for Indian cotton, such as Omra and Rangoon, and the price also rose by six or seven yuan, because the public expected coarse lint to be expensive and competed to buy it.</p>
<p>Omra 100 bales 346.0 Haojia</p>

<p>Also 300 bales 345.0 again</p>

<p>End of October Term</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to Southern investors selling short, but subsequently rebounded due to buying by other investors, buying in New Orleans, and short covering. As a result, the closing price was about 17-18 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculative buying and a good stock market, but subsequently fell slightly due to some floating bulls selling and European exporters selling. Yesterday's closing price rose by 1-2 rupees each. It is also predicted that the opening market situation today will rise by 1.75 rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction market is quiet and firm, but actual transactions are only slightly embellished with spot cotton. Although current demand for forward contracts is eager from all parties and the intention is very strong, due to the procedures not being perfect, they can only temporarily wait and see.</p>
<h3>Securities: C Bonds Not Too High; Situation Still Not Like a Small Face</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds continued to be good yesterday, mostly due to short covering. The bulls took the opportunity to increase their positions. C Bonds discovered a new high price of 72 yuan 8 jiao and half after deducting interest. The market price is not too high, but the situation is still not like a sudden small downturn. This is all because the general public is not as confused about China's future as before, and they firmly believe that the future is very bright, so the confidence in bonds is more solid. Yesterday morning, Xinfu, Hongda, Yongkang, and Shengda bought in large quantities, while Zhongfu, Runli, Dazhong, etc. supplied. The midday closing was slightly better by 2-3 jiao. In the afternoon, Tongkang again had a strong appetite, in a large amount. Xinfu bulls increased their positions. Changji, Lianyi, and No. 25 all had needs. Although Xinhua came out, Xiexing, Yuanda Hua, and Jiufeng sold out. The market price was raised to the highest price of 28 jiao. Although the market price was raised very high, the number of transactions was not large. The total number of transactions for the whole day was only 1.45 million yuan. The following is a brief table:</p>
<p>Stock transaction:成交永安紗廠股 Ten shares of Wing On Textile Factory stock were transacted, the price being 207 yuan and half.</p>
<p>The turnover of public utility stocks was especially large, and the price changed from stable to firm. Although there were occasional headwinds in the middle, they were too short-lived. The potential of both industrial and rubber stocks is extremely good.</p>
<p>London, 17th (Wednesday). The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British-owned Far East companies' stocks remained flat today. Only bank stocks showed slight fluctuations. Jardine Matheson Bank rose one shilling and three pence to nine pounds seven shillings and six pence. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Hong Kong Registered shares fell by one pound to eighty-five pounds. There were prices but no market.</p>
<h3>Yangtze Bank Company Increases Capital to Acquire New Industries</h3>
<p>The British-owned China International Trust Investment Company Limited plans to transfer most of its assets to the Yangtze Bank Company and liquidate itself. It is understood that all shareholders of International Trust will receive one new share of Yangtze stock for each share, plus a certain amount of cash. In order to purchase most of the assets of the company, the British-owned Yangtze Bank Company plans to issue 517,500 new shares at a price of 18 yuan per share. Each old share can subscribe for one new share. The company also plans to reduce the face value of each share to five taels of silver. Each original old share will then be split into two new shares.</p>
<h3>Economic Talk</h3>
<p>— Feng Liu</p>
<p>Lighters are boats used to transfer goods from large ships to the shore. The name "lighter" has been around for a long time, perhaps coming with the opening of trade between China and Britain. This term was first seen in Guangzhou, and then gradually spread from the Cantonese people to the coastal trading ports, and has now become a common term, but the origin of its original meaning is unknown.</p>
<p>I once saw the name "lighter" in Liang Tingnan's "Yifen Jiwen." It said:</p>
<p>"Bengal and Bombay are where opium comes from. Since the early Qianlong years, the number of people in the interior who are addicted to eating has gradually increased, and the smuggling has accumulated over the years. At one time, more than 20,000 boxes arrived, with a value of more than 60 million. They were continuously shipped from the new ports of Southeast Asia to Yuehai. The ships in Lingdingyang sold them and then shipped them again, endlessly, called lighters. They were entirely dependent on the unscrupulous people who were idlers and smugglers in the interior to carry them by boat into the country, and then transport them to the interior, passing through the coastal counties to Tianjin, all of which were where lighters flowed. The vendors first collected the goods in the provincial capital, entered the foreign residence, exchanged opium orders, gave them to the buyers, and showed them to the lighters, which then gave them according to the number."</p>
<p>Judging from the text, "called lighters" proves that the name "lighter" only existed at this time. "All of which were where lighters flowed" means that the coastal counties to Tianjin knew of lighters all came from opium smuggling.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of "躉"? It is the opposite of zero, and it means whole numbers, such as bulk sales, such as bulk purchases, all of which refer to wholesale transactions. However, "躉" is originally a vulgar character. The meaning of this character is likely limited to the old boundaries of wealth, with "thousands of strings of cash" as satisfaction. Therefore, the character "足" is added under the character "萬" to emphasize the greatness of its number. Now, when used for unloading ships, the cargo carried on the unloading ship ultimately does not seem to be much, and it is unloaded from large ships. It cannot be called whole, and it cannot be called "躉." To say that the cargo on the ship is sold in bulk rather than broken into pieces, so the ship is called a lighter, is also not close to the truth. According to this, the wholesale shop can be called a "躉 shop". What you need to know is that the lighters at that time were actually large foreign ships that could not sail into Lingdingyang, or they were afraid that the Chinese authorities would prohibit them, so they dared not sail in, and were parked in the outer ocean. The lighters then transported the opium to the inner sea. The place where the transactions were conducted was the foreign residence. The foreign residence was where foreigners lived, that is, the later consulate. Once the transaction was completed, they went to the lighter to pick up the goods. Therefore, the role of the lighter was actually to temporarily store the goods unloaded from the large ship. Therefore, I agree with Mr. Meng Xinshi's statement: "The so-called lighter may originally be a '頓' boat, meaning a place to stop." However, Mr. Meng did not want to confirm that its name was "頓" boat, indicating that it "may originally be". He also did not investigate the origin of the name "躉" and the reason why it should be "頓" boat. I am not talented, and I explain it again. If Mr. Meng were here, I don't know what he would think of my words!</p>
<p>I believe that the reason why "躉" is "躉" came from the foreign goods trade at that time. In the Chinese meaning, the word "躉 boat" is difficult to explain appropriately, and it must be related to the sound of foreign words. Therefore, I think that the "躉" in "躉 boat" and the "噸" in tonnage are both spoken by foreigners. The Chinese people imitated their sounds and used them along, so the "噸" in tonnage in "Yifen Jiwen" is also written as "躉," which further proves that my understanding is not wrong. The "噸" in tonnage comes from the pronunciation of the English word "Ton" and can be used as "躉," so how do we know that the "躉" in "躉 boat" is not similarly called a "躉 boat" from the English word "Tender"? Therefore, "躉" is a transliteration, not a translation.</p>
<p>"Tender" originally refers to a ship that transports passengers and goods from a large ship to land. There are also ships used to store food and other supplies for large ships. In short, it is a ship that assists large ships where they cannot reach, so as to connect the large ship with the land, regardless of whether it is passengers or goods, all with the purpose of reaching the land. According to the original Chinese characters, it can be called a lighter (now commonly written as barge). If using the English sound to call it, it would be most appropriate to translate it as "頓 boat" in both sound and meaning.</p>
<p>The sound and meaning of "頓" originally came from "屯," so there are stopping, storing, and depositing, and it also has the meaning of storing, which is actually close to the function of today's lighters. The sound is also similar: (I also have an article on "hoarding" waiting for a chance to publish in the future, you can refer to it) The goods of the lighters are nothing but the goods carried on the large ship that cannot be reached directly, temporarily stored to reach the shore, not for wholesale. The author at the time sought temporary convenience and wrote it as "躉 boat". Now, if we want to find a meaning that is both sound and meaning can be connected, then how about calling it "頓 boat"?</p>
<p>Also, the English term for a small steamboat used to tow cargo ships is "Tug," such as the ones we often see in the Huangpu River, with three or four cargo ships connected behind a small steamboat, and sailing away with a roar. Although "Tug" is also used to transport goods, it does not directly load and unload goods, so it is different from lighters. For the convenience of readers, I still use "躉 boat" in the title.</p>
<h3>Finance For the Deduction of Brokerage Fees, the Gold Market Was Once Excited; 2,000 Taels of October Futures Were Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the dull and dark market suddenly experienced unexpected twists and turns. The long-dormant October futures also fluctuated by 72 yuan, with trading volume increasing to around 2,000 taels. It is said that the HSBC's small counter reduced the US dollar exchange rate by .03125 to deduct Xu Kuo's brokerage fee, causing a reduction. Fellow traders were initially unaware of the truth and scrambled to buy, driving the price from 6,873 yuan to 6,945 yuan (bought by the Chaozhou gang). By 10:30 am, they gradually understood the reason for the reduction. Gold firms, seeing the high price, began selling, and silver firms re-emerged, pushing the price back down to within 6,900 yuan. In the afternoon, the difference was only 8 yuan, and the momentum turned sluggish again. Finally, it closed up 25 yuan. The market became listless again. Cash fluctuations were significant, with the market first rising and then falling. In the morning, Yongcheng first bought 10 taels from Hesheng for 9,060 yuan, pushing the price up by 20 yuan. Soon after, Gonghe sold 10 taels from Yuhao for 9,050 yuan. The price then gradually rose, with Xiangxing continuing to buy 10 taels from Defu for 9,070 yuan. Xianghe bought 10 taels each from Yongcheng, Decheng, and Hesheng, and then bought 20 taels from Xiangxing and Yong, and 30 taels from Wanfeng, all at 9,080 yuan. Shunyuan bought 10 taels each from Hesheng, Fukang, Yonggu, and Decheng bought 10 taels from Lianxing, Xiangxing and Yong bought 20 taels from Mingfeng, and Yifeng bought 10 taels, all at 9,100 yuan. Xiangxing and Yong bought 20 taels from Chengji, Shunyuan bought 30 taels from Xianghe, and Tianyuan bought 20 taels, all at 9,120 yuan. Hesheng bought 20 taels from Decheng at 9,125 yuan, then bought 10 taels each from Shunyuan and Wanfeng at 9,130 yuan, and then bought another 10 taels from Shunyuan, retreating to 9,120 yuan. Xianghe bought 100 taels from Xinfeng Yong at 9,125 yuan. Tongkang Yong sold 40 taels to Shunyuan at 9,120 yuan, and then sold 60 taels to Xianghe at 9,110 yuan. Xianghe sold 20 taels to Shunyuan at 9,120 yuan. Seeing the rise in gold futures, Xianghe resumed buying, immediately pushing the price up. Xianghe bought 10 taels from Jinyuan and 20 taels from Chengji at 9,250 yuan. Soon after, the price fell back down. Xiangxing Yong sold 50 taels, Yida sold 40 taels, and Hesheng sold 10 taels, all bought by Dafeng. Zhongxing sold 20 taels to Xianghe, Yida sold 40 taels to Wanfeng, another 30 taels, and Lianxing sold 20 taels, all bought by Decheng, all at a price of 9,150 yuan. Xinfeng Yong sold 20 taels, Yongcheng sold 10 taels, all bought by Xianghe, at a price of 9,100 yuan. Xiangxing Yong sold 20 taels to Tianyuan and 10 taels to Xianghe at the same price. At noon, there were sellers at 9,080 yuan. In the afternoon, Hesheng sold 10 taels to Xianghe for 9,040 yuan. Later, there were no transactions, and the price was the same as the previous day. There was a difference of 210 yuan on the day, and a total of more than 800 taels were traded. The selling price of cash gold from the local brands was 9,100 yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Market Sentiment Slightly Up</p>
<p>Since the morning, the October futures (10 taels each) opened at 9:15 am at 6,873 yuan, up 3 yuan. Chida bought aggressively, pushing the price up to 6,880 yuan. The market was originally very stable. After 10 am, news suddenly broke that HSBC's small counter had suddenly reduced the US dollar exchange rate by .03125, causing a stir. Mingfeng, Dingsheng, Xinfeng Yong, and Yiyuan aggressively bought, and sellers temporarily held back, causing the price to jump up by more than 60 yuan. Xiangxing Yong bought, pushing the price up to 6,945 yuan. Later, it was understood that the .03125 reduction was actually a brokerage commission. Tianyuan resumed selling, and Litai, Hesheng, and Xianghe all sold. At noon, the price fell back to within 6,900 yuan. The noon close saw Dingsheng buy 20 taels from Tianyuan for 6,895 yuan. The afternoon opening was up 3 yuan at 6,898 yuan. Jufeng Yong and Mingfeng sold small amounts to 6,890 yuan. Tianyuan bought, pushing the price up to the 3:30 pm close at 6,895 yuan, up 25 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. There was a difference of 72 yuan on the day.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Rises in the Morning and Falls Back in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The selling price of ornamental gold from silver shops was raised by 10 yuan at 10:30 am by Datonghang and Xintonghang to 940 yuan, and then fell back down to 930 yuan at 12:00 pm. The buying price was reduced by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>HSBC Small Counter Suddenly Reduced the .03125 Difference as a Brokerage Commission for Exchange Bills</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Central Bank and HSBC posting the same rates. HSBC's small counter suddenly announced a reduction of .03125 in the US dollar exchange rate, to 5.28125 yuan. It was inquired that last Friday, 14 foreign banks in the city telegraphed the Hong Kong Equalization Fund, requesting to maintain the livelihood of exchange bill brokers. Yesterday, a reply was received stating that the reduced .03125 would be used as the broker's commission. However, in the black market, US dollars for non-essential goods were still very difficult to obtain at 4.75 yuan, leading speculators to directly settle transactions with banks, selling to banks at 5.125 yuan and covering short positions at 5 yuan. There was a lot of activity. The market price was approximately 2 pence 8.125 for British pounds and 4.6875 yuan for US dollars, tighter by .03125 and .0625 respectively compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>US Dollars Have Begun to Recover</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds and British gold notes remain quite stable. US dollar notes have begun to recover, although they briefly rose to 22.7 yuan in the morning before falling back down. The final price was 22.2 yuan, a slight recovery of .4 yuan compared to the previous day. The trend of Hong Kong notes was stable, and the market price remained flat. Japanese gold notes continued to rise, reaching 2.38 yuan in the evening market. Korean notes saw a large surge, reaching 2.01 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Nanyang Sales Continue Uninterrupted; Factory Cloth Transactions Increase</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday, mainly because the situation in the Pacific remained tense, and speculative trading was considered difficult. However, actual sales were very good, with most being shipped to Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang. Factory transactions increased daily, far exceeding market prices. For example, Jardine Matheson's Jin San Ta bleached cloth was quoted by the factory for futures delivery at 72.5 yuan, and Holland cloth was quoted at 12.5 yuan, both 2 yuan higher per piece than current spot market prices. The market price of all grades was stable yesterday. Street transactions amounted to over 500 pieces of various cloths. The Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled over 400 pieces of bleached and dyed cloths. The Nanyang merchants handled over 300 pieces of coarse and fine cloths, twills, and bleached cloths.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth spot market was closed. The leading standard of the exchange edged up, with September up 1.5 cents, October up 1.7 cents, November up (blank) cents, and December up 1 cent.</p>
<h3>Tea (2)</h3>
<p>— Li Yuyong</p>
<p>(Continued from the 4th)</p>
<p>However, the majority of scholars still compromise on both the Chinese and Indian theories, believing that it originated in the mountains of the Tibetan Plateau, according to the opinion of the famous tea tree scholar Coben Staurt. He differed from them, saying that Chinese tea and Indian tea came from different systems. The small-leaf variety in China originated in China, while the large-leaf variety in India, Myanmar, and Annam is not found in southeastern China. He also used the trend of hybridization to examine its distribution and migration. Chinese scholars still advocate the theory of Chinese origin, believing that the wild tea of ​​Sichuan and Yunnan shifted east to become the small-leaf variety and west to become the large-leaf variety. "The record of eastward migration has already been mentioned above. According to records, the tea found in Assam is planted in groups and in an organized manner, and local natives still use it to make tea. In 1815, Latter and Gardner also said that tea trees grow in native villages in northeastern Assam and are used for their leaves. Only in Mengzi did they not see it being used by the natives. Staurt also said that tea trees are planted on important transportation routes in China and India. As for whether the tea originally produced in China can become large-leaf? Mr. Liu Zhen said: In recent years, there is a Narcissus variety in Fujian Province with leaves twice as large as ordinary ones. There is also a Buddha's Hand variety with very large and broad leaves. Therefore, it is also possible that the wild tea species migrated westward from Sichuan and Yunnan and gradually became large-leaf varieties due to differences in climate and planting and harvesting methods.</p>
<p>China has a long history of importing tea into Europe. The earliest record is from the 9th century AD, when the Islamic merchant Soleman said in his travelogue of Arabia, Persia, and China (1845), "The Chinese are accustomed to drinking a withered thing called Sakh, which is fragrant and bitter, and is said to be good for health. It is sold everywhere in the country." Marco Polo came to China, but he did not mention tea in his travelogue. In the 16th century, when the Portuguese traded with China, tea was already popular, but they did not trade it with China. The first European to record tea was Mattei in his History of India (1589). Later, Comte's "New History of China" recorded tea in detail. The Dutch East India Company was the first to import tea into Europe. Lettson said in his Tea Record in 1772 that the Dutch transported tea into Europe at the beginning of the 17th century, but not from China but from Japan. Bomene's Encyclopedia (1791) has an interesting story under the word "Salvia." He said that our ordinary Salvia is very popular with the Chinese and Japanese. The Dutch often collect this withered thing in Southern Europe and bring it to China to exchange for their tea. A large box of Salvia can be exchanged for two or three boxes of tea, but there is no other evidence. Although it is unreliable that the Dutch brought tea to Europe in the 17th century, it is undoubtedly the Dutch who brought tea to Europe. In 1641, a physicist in Amsterdam named Tulpiug wrote a medical record, saying that he had never seen tea, but in 1658, Piso said that the European aristocracy was already drinking tea as a fashion. It is said that tea first spread to Russia in 1600, to Paris in 1636, and to England in 1650. As for the transplantation of living tea trees, it was probably started by the Dutch. A merchant in Danzig named Breyn included tea in the plant atlas of the Dutch botanical garden in 1689, saying that it was planted in the garden of Amsterdam, but Puhuo knew that they all thought that Linnaeus of Sweden was the first person. The tea planted by Linnaeus was sent to him by Eckeberg, arriving on October 1, 1763, at least 80 years later than the Dutch. Linnaeus was the first person to name tea. He did not know that black tea and green tea were made from the same species. At first (1737) he called it Thea Chinensis, and later (1762) he divided it into black tea (J. Bohea) and green tea (T. Viridis). Bohea means Wuyi Mountain. Later, after several changes, he restored the earliest name. Under the species of tea, there are also several variants. According to Staut's opinion, there are four categories, namely the ordinary Wuyi variant (Var. Bohea), the large-leaf variant of the Sichuan species (Var. Macrophylla), the upper Burmese variant (Var. Shanform), and the Assam variant (Var. Assamica). The Pu'er tea we see is made from the fourth type. (End)</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council Approved New Electricity Pricing Methods; Three Surcharges Are Now Combined into Two; The Foreign Exchange Surcharge Will Change Monthly; The Total Standard Electricity Bill Is More Than 10% Higher Than Before</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Power Company of the Public Concession, previously claiming a shortage of coal supply and uncertain deliveries, submitted a request to the Municipal Council for approval of electricity conservation measures. It stipulated that monthly electricity consumption should not exceed 72% of the highest electricity consumption in the previous year and also levied a fuel surcharge. From the 19th of last month, the method was changed again, increasing the surcharge for excess electricity consumption. Only a month later, the company submitted another request to the Municipal Council for approval to change the pricing method. Although the names established are different, the result is still an increase in expenses for users. The suggestions made by the power company were discussed twice by the Bureau, and finally passed by the Municipal Council's regular meeting the day before yesterday afternoon. The announcement issued by the Municipal Council yesterday is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Using US$5 as a Standard</p>
<p>According to the Municipal Council Information Office, the Council recently approved, as suggested by the subcommittee, a plan to enable the Shanghai Power Company to increase its income to meet the company's debts and expenses. According to this plan, all current surcharges, namely foreign exchange, fuel, and temporary, are immediately canceled and replaced by (1) a fuel adjustment fee and (2) a revised foreign exchange surcharge. The fuel adjustment fee is the same as that always applied to large users. The revised foreign exchange surcharge applies to basic electricity charges and other miscellaneous fees such as the rental of electrical appliances, etc. If the US dollar is 5 yuan to 100 yuan of Chinese currency, then this foreign exchange surcharge is 100% of the basic fee and miscellaneous fees. In the future, monthly charges may vary depending on the rise and fall of the average exchange rate in the previous month. As mentioned above, the basic rate of the revised foreign exchange surcharge is 200%. If the income approved by the company is surplus or insufficient after the implementation of this rate, it may be revised in the future.</p>
<p>Pricing Methods Changed Again</p>
<p>The above plan almost allows each user to pay according to the actual cost of using electricity. The basic electricity charge for residential lighting is proposed to be reduced from the current 1.2 cents per unit to 1.1 cents per unit. In May of this year, when the company was approved to collect a temporary surcharge, it was already felt that it was necessary to change the pricing method. The approval of this temporary surcharge was originally an expedient measure, while considering this issue. It was found that the consumption of fuel and the sale of electricity are closely related, so it is believed that the best way to compensate for the extra expenses exceeding the basic electricity charge is to levy a fuel adjustment fee on all electricity charges, and the remaining income should be restored by implementing a uniform surcharge on the company's total fee rate.</p>
<p>New Method Will Be Used for Next Electricity Bill</p>
<p>The aforementioned plan was suggested by the Bureau's subcommittee, accepted by the power company, and passed by the Municipal Council's regular meeting after being transferred by the Public Utilities Committee. It is approved to be applied to the accounts for the period ending on or after October 1 of this year, and may be reconsidered by the Bureau or the company at any time in the future. The table below shows a comparison of current and future electricity charges (using the exchange rate and fuel costs applicable in September as the standard):</p>
<p>Note: (1) The total electricity charges now and in the future are calculated based on an exchange rate of US$5 and a fuel cost of 7.06 taels of silver per million BTU. (2) The surcharge includes the fuel adjustment fee. (3) Under the future basic fee, the residential lighting fee is reduced to 1.1 cents per unit. (4) The right table is in yuan.</p>
<h3>American Ship SS Lykes Detained by Jianghai Customs Allegedly for Violating Customs Regulations</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post* reported that the American Lykes Bros. Steamship Co.'s *Zoelaa Lykes*, was detained today (the 18th) by the Shanghai Customs authorities. It is said that the reason was a violation of Jianghai Customs regulations. The ship's Shanghai agent, American President Lines, declined to comment. When reporters inquired with the Customs Commissioner Mr. Lowford, he also declined to comment. The ship was recently built and was on its first voyage to the Far East. American President Lines has reported the detention to the US Consulate and is in direct talks with the customs authorities in an attempt to have the vessel released. The rumour that the ship was carrying machine oil for Japanese businesses, and was detained for violating a new embargo after arriving, with Japanese businesses asking for the detention when the vessel sought to divert to Manila, has been denied by the shipping company.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Tracks Blown Up</h3>
<p>Mixed Train Delayed; Full Explosion Destruction Encountered The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post* reported that early yesterday morning (the 17th) near Kunshan on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, there was a thunderous explosion which sought to blow up a mixed passenger and freight train from Nanjing to Shanghai. However, the train was slightly delayed and thus was not destroyed. According to the Japanese military authorities, the train left Kunshan fifteen minutes behind schedule. Shortly after, the engineer noticed a light waving six hundred meters ahead. He immediately stopped the train. The light was being waved by a Japanese soldier guarding the railway, who had heard the explosion and gone to investigate. He saw that a section of track and sleepers of about ten feet had been blown away, and frantically waved the light to warn the oncoming train. It was then discovered that the train, had it left on schedule, would have passed through that area at the time of the explosion.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Visit Rangoon To Strengthen Aid to China Mission to Negotiate Exemption of Military Supplies from Transit Taxes; Portuguese Minister Mr. Lime Returned to Shanghai from Qingdao</h3>
<p>The whereabouts of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, are currently being revealed by British sources. The Ambassador flew from Chongqing to Burma on the 16th of this month, en route to Rangoon, and will spend three weeks in Rangoon. According to reports, the Ambassador's trip is ordered to handle the entry of Chinese and Burmese nationals and the exemption of US military supplies from transit taxes, which are also linked. The Ambassador is tasked with strengthening the mission to aid China. After finishing business in Rangoon, he will travel to Singapore to meet with the British Minister of Information in Singapore, Mr. Tuff Cooper. In addition, the Portuguese Minister to China, Mr. Lime, and his wife, visited North China and the Yantai Qingdao area earlier this summer for vacation. They went to Qingdao several weeks ago and have now returned to Shanghai from Qingdao, still residing at their private residence on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Was the 10th Anniversary of the Mukden Incident Passed in Silence</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 10th anniversary of the Mukden Incident. People from all walks of life in the city commemorated the event spiritually and voluntarily suspended entertainment and banquets. The concessions were passed peacefully under the strict guard of the police authorities. Alert leaflets and slogans were found throughout the city. Citizens' morale was boosted. Due to environmental constraints, all walks of life in the city did not hold ceremonies for this commemoration, but supported the government's established national policy with spirit and unwavering will, striving for survival, and the increasingly favorable stage of the war situation added infinite excitement to this commemorative day, so they all voluntarily promoted donation movements. The V-shaped flag charity sale initiated by the Shanghai student community also began yesterday.</p>
<h3>Five Foreign Banks Resolved To Increase US Dollar Commission</h3>
<p>Quotation is Five Yuan Two Eight One Two Five; The Statutory Exchange Rate of the Equalization Fund Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Since the Equalization Fund began managing the foreign exchange market on the 18th of last month, announcing that importers engaged in legitimate trade would be allowed to use US$5.34375 and British currency three pence one eight seven five, only specially approved banks engaged in foreign exchange were to charge a handling fee of .03125, so the listed US dollar was five yuan three one two five and British currency was three pence one five six two five. Now it is learned that HSBC's quotation, since 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the US currency has shrunk to .03125, to five yuan two eight one two five, except that the British currency has remained unchanged. This change has attracted much attention from all parties. It is learned that this move has nothing to do with the Equalization Fund, and the exchange rate announced by the Association has not changed so far, so the .03125 reduction is entirely the result of the meeting of HSBC, Maijiali, Youli, Citibank Avenue, and Five Banks. The Five Banks decided not to participate in the black market, and for brokerage relations, the decision was made to increase the handling fee of .03125, for .0625, from yesterday, so even though the exchange rate announced by the Equalization Fund has not changed, the increased handling fee caused the US dollar to shrink to five yuan two eight one two five.</p>
<h3>Average Prices of Goods</h3>
<p>The following table shows average retail prices for Wednesday, September 17, and from August 16 to September 15. The Municipal Council’s Department of Social Affairs compiled this price list for employers to adjust employee subsidies.</p>

<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation to Run Hong Kong-Meixian Air Route; Eurasia Airline Ticket Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Hong Kong-Shaoguan air route, transportation between Hong Kong and Shaoguan has become much more convenient. For the convenience of overseas Chinese going abroad or returning home, the Guangdong Provincial Government consulted with the Ministry of Communications on establishing a new air route between Hong Kong and Meixian. The route is managed by Eurasia Aviation Corporation and is said to be under active development. The Meixian airport began construction several months ago, and all work is generally ready. According to reporter's investigation, the airport is located in Jiaoling, Meixian, and the location is very safe. It will officially open in October.</p>
<p>Ticket Price Increase</p>
<p>Eurasia Company's ticket prices have been increased on the Chongqing-Hong Kong and Chongqing-Kunming routes since August 1. It is learned that since August 15, the Hong Kong-Guilin (Hong Kong-Guilin), Hong Kong-Chongqing (Hong Kong-Chongqing), and Hong Kong-Yunnan (Hong Kong-Kunming) routes have also been adjusted along with the China National Aviation Corporation's rates. The prices are recorded as follows: Hong Kong-Guilin one-way ticket is HK$600 per person, luggage and freight are HK$10 per kilogram; Hong Kong-Chongqing one-way ticket is HK$600 per person, luggage and freight are HK$10 per kilogram; Hong Kong-Yunnan route is HK$820 per person, luggage and freight are HK$11.4 per kilogram.</p>

<h3>New Route from Shanghai to Ningbo and Jinhua Has Been Opened</h3>
<p>Since Ningbo was occupied, transportation to Jinhua has been cut off. It is now known that single traders have opened up a new route, traveling back and forth for two months, but mostly taking remote villages. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the routes are as follows: (1) from Ningbo to Yuyao and then to Shangyu and Shengxian; (2) from Ningbo to Xiwu and then to Xiaozhang and Xinchang; (3) from Ningbo to Yinjiang Bridge Zhangcun Fenshiling and then to Xinchang.</p>
<h3>French Flagship in Shanghai Sailed to Vietnam</h3>
<p>The French flagship *Général Metzinger* and the destroyers *Brail* and gunboat *Vaillante* left Shanghai on the 17th and sailed out of the Wusongkou. According to French naval authorities, the flagship *Général Metzinger* was ordered to Vietnam. The flagship of the French Far East Fleet, *Lamotte-Picquet*, has arrived in Osaka, Japan, from Saigon and is in the shipyard for repairs.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Assault Case the Night Before Last: Three People Were Injured, One Was a Customs Officer, and the Injured Chinese Man Was Suspected of Being Arrested</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that Mr. Fukuyama, a Japanese customs officer, was walking along Sichuan Road near Ningbo Road at about 9 p.m. last night (the 17th) when he was suddenly attacked. The assailant fired three shots, and Fukuyama was shot through his left arm with one bullet. He went to Fumin Hospital for treatment. Last night, at nearly 10 p.m., Japanese men Kimura and Suzuki were attacked by two Chinese men at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road. One was injured in the abdomen, and the other in the back.</p>
<p>The injuries were not serious.</p>
<p>According to police officers, the empty bullet casings found at the two crime scenes were similar. The motive for the shooting of these three Japanese civilians is not yet clear. Many believe that there is a political motive. However, it has been said that the three Japanese men have no connection with politics. After Fukuyama was attacked, he did not report it to the police but went to Fumin Hospital himself. Later, Japanese police officers accompanied the two Japanese men who were injured on Nanjing Road to Fumin Hospital, and only then did they learn the details of Fukuyama's</p>
<p>attack.</p>
<p>Two detectives from the Public Concession Police, Messrs. Moore and Kirk, are now responsible for investigating these two cases together with the Japanese military police. According to reports, after Fukuyama was attacked on Sichuan Road last night, the Central Police Station received a report that a car in the area had been shot at three times. However, this was later found to be inaccurate. The English-language "China Press" reported that after the two Japanese men were attacked on Nanjing Road and Shandong Road, public concession police officers arrived on the scene and arrested a suspected Chinese man who is now being questioned. The Chinese man has a bullet wound on his arm, which may have been self-inflicted.</p>
<p>Customs Officer</p>
<p>Another report states that at 9:25 p.m. the night before last (the 17th), a shooting occurred on Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road targeting a car. At the time, the car sped away, so it was impossible to know who was inside and whether anyone was injured. It is now known that the passenger in the car was Fukuyama Jitsu, a Japanese supervisor at the Jianghai Customs, aged 32. He had collected tax payments from Zhongshan Road and was passing the scene of the incident in a car when suddenly three shots were fired, all penetrating the car. One bullet shattered Fukuyama Jitsu's finger, and another grazed his sleeve, causing no injury. He went to the hospital for bandaging and then left. In the shooting that occurred at the corner of Nanjing Road and Shandong Road, Japanese men Kimura Riichi and Suzuki Soji both suffered bullet wounds in the abdomen, and their injuries are extremely critical. Suzuki currently runs a trading company on Miller Road.</p>
<h3>Shooting on Maohai Road and Yuezhou Road</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Surround a House, Exchange Fire More Than 30 Times, Resulting in Four Arrests</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese-language "Continental Daily News" stated yesterday (the 17th) that at 1 p.m. yesterday, Japanese Marine Corps soldiers surrounded a house at the corner of Maohai Road and Yuezhou Road. Four men inside opened fire with pistols in an attempt to break out. The Japanese soldiers also opened fire in return, exchanging fire more than 30 times. No one was injured. The four men were eventually captured and are now being interrogated.</p>
<h3>Hope and Encouragement (1) - Written After the Industrial and Commercial Group Scholarship - Written by Applicant No. 46</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao is 69 years old, and its spirit of serving society and promoting culture is truly vigorous in its old age. This time, sympathizing with poor students, the newspaper has launched a scholarship campaign, making a sincere appeal to its broad readership. All those who receive assistance are deeply grateful and feel it in their hearts, which cannot be expressed in words. In addition to our gratitude, we must work diligently, study hard, and be loyal to our duties, so as not to disappoint the Shen Bao and its wide readership.</p>
<p>The situation of industrial and commercial employees is even more miserable and difficult than that of ordinary students. As for myself, I lost my father at the age of nine, and at thirteen, I stepped out of the school gate. In order to make a living, I had to go to the streets to beg. I had a sick mother to support, two young brothers to care for, and I was an ignorant youth with incomplete knowledge and skills. Since I entered a large public institution at the age of fifteen, for these long nine years, labor and tears have been my companions in life. However, I am young, I have a future, so I constantly seek knowledge and pursue truth on the thorny road, hoping to improve my personal life in the small way and not to be a useless person in the big way. I was fortunate to have my application for assistance approved this time, and I am very happy! After reading the entire list of recipients, I have many feelings. Since this event is still a pioneering initiative, it may not fully meet the ideals of the donors. Therefore, I dare to review the facts published in the newspaper, add my own humble opinions, and say a few words to the assisted friends, in order to fulfill my responsibilities and hope that the scholarship movement will be carried forward. I hope that people in society will teach me if there is anything inappropriate, I would be very grateful!</p>
<p>Since the Shen Bao subsidized students, due to the enthusiastic requests of industrial and commercial employees and the suggestions of donors who are enthusiastic about vocational education, the scholarship committee decided to allocate funds to set up an industrial and commercial group scholarship after careful consideration. It started on August 24th, with the announcement of two simple rules, namely that the approval of the manager must be obtained to avoid hindering business, and that the application should focus on tuition fees. On the first day of application, more than 200 people stood out. Individual interviews were conducted in batches from August 28th to make a decision. The list of approved names and amounts was announced one after another starting from September 1st.</p>
<p>After the news of the establishment of the industrial and commercial group scholarship was announced, there was another enthusiastic phenomenon, that is, various vocational supplementary schools responded one after another, willing to donate free or half-fee places for the Shen Bao to co-organize the event, a total of 21 schools.

<h3>British Tramways: All Lines Resume Service</h3>
<p>After the ticket seller No. 40 of the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company in the Public Concession clashed with the Western police officer No. 57 over a minor matter, resulting in a strike by all the ticket sellers in support, the authorities and the company's comprador, Mr. Hu, intervened to mediate and promised to be responsible for negotiating a solution. All the workers accepted the advice and resumed work at 1 p.m. the day before yesterday, resuming the operation of tram lines 1 and 2.

<h3>Opening of Hu Ruosi's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>The famous painter Mr. Hu Ruosi is gifted with artistic talent. When imitating the works of famous predecessors, he can often capture their essence. He usually likes to travel to famous mountains and rivers, and his paintings are even more outstanding. In the past, when Belgium held an exposition, only three great painters in China were awarded medals: Huang Binhong, Zhang Shanzi, and Mr. Hu. This is indeed rare and commendable. Now, he is exhibiting more than one hundred of his most satisfying works accumulated in recent years, including the giant twelve-foot masterpiece "Autumn Sounds," which is a divine piece. The exhibition will open on the 19th of this month at the Ningbo Native Place Association and will last for five days. Collectors and connoisseurs at home and abroad should not miss it.</p>

<h3>Lost Fountain Pen</h3>
<p>At about 9 a.m. on the 15th, I mailed a registered letter at the post office on Carter Road, but I forgot to bring a pencil and could not fill out the form. Therefore, I begged an unknown friend to borrow a fountain pen. The friend immediately handed the fountain pen to me for use. Unexpectedly, after I finished filling in the form, this person had already left. I searched in all directions, but could not find him. Therefore, I would like to ask your newspaper to publish this notice to claim the lost item. The loser can contact Wen Dezhao at No. 95 Tongfu Road, stating the brand and style, to claim it.</p>
<h3>The Assassination Case on Tongfu Road Yesterday: Chen Changkun Was Assassinated, The Assistant Manager of Xingye Thermos Factory Was Shot Twice and Died Instantly</h3>
<p>A bloody incident occurred on Tongfu Road yesterday morning. The victim was Chen Changkun, the assistant manager of the China Xingye Thermos Factory at No. 15, Lane 315, on that road. Chen was from Shaoxing, 34 years old, and lived at No. 3 Baoxing Lane, Shanhai Guan Road. He had been the assistant manager of the factory for many years. He usually had a private chartered car for transportation. At 10:05 a.m. yesterday, Chen, wearing a black wool long gown and yellow leather shoes, took the chartered car, pulled by the driver Changfa from Jiangbei, to the factory for work. When he reached the entrance of No. 3155 near Xieqiao Lane, Tongfu Road, two men suddenly fired two shots at Chen. One shot hit the head, the bullet penetrating the brain from the edge of the right temple, passing through the eye socket. The other bullet hit the ring finger of his right hand. He immediately bled profusely and fell into the car. Changfa was extremely panicked, but still pulled the car and fled towards the factory. When he stopped at the factory gate, the nearby police officers had received the news and arrived, but the assailants had already escaped. The injured man was taken by car to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but because the injury was in a vital area, he died soon after.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>

Sincerely, the management of Weigong Dance Hall. September 18th.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Authorities Publish an Overview of Education in the Previous Year (2) Education Department and Normal School Students Must Take Remedial Physical Education Classes</h3>
<p>Normal Education In 1939, the Normal School had 48 graduates. In September 1940, another 48 new students were recruited, 24 each for the Chinese and English departments. Six students received government scholarships this year, graduated from the University of Hong Kong, and obtained qualified teacher status. Another eight people received scholarships, seven of whom are required to study at the University for four years, and the other one is a university graduate who continues to study education for one year. Seven students from the University Normal School obtained diplomas in this year's graduation examination. There are currently 45 students. The special night college also has teacher training classes, which are exclusively for Chinese teachers currently employed. The admission qualification is two years of teaching experience. The study period is three years. There are currently 76 male students and 93 female students.</p>
<p>Women's Education (1) English Schools: A. European girls are co-educated with boys, as mentioned above. B. Asian students' English schools are not affected by the evacuation order. The official Belilios Public School for Girls has 4572 primary school students and 157 middle school students. There are seven subsidized schools with 1387 primary school students and 815 middle school students. There are two private unsubsidized girls' middle schools (each with attached primary schools), four primary schools, two vocational schools (co-educational), and six night schools at the primary school level. (2) Chinese Schools: A. In rural areas, there are eight subsidized schools and nine unsubsidized primary schools (including one night school), one middle school, and one co-educational vocational school, with a total of 2387 students. B. In urban areas, private girls' schools have a total of 30,260 students. 1137 students are studying in two subsidized schools, and 1931 students are studying in schools receiving subsidies (including 56 primary schools and 5 middle schools). In addition, there are 253 unsubsidized day schools and 28 night schools. There is one official Chinese girls' school, which has been changed from a normal school system to a middle school system, with 151 students. Seventeen students obtained diplomas in the July 1940 examination. (3) Teacher Training: At the end of 1940, there were 48 students studying at the Normal School, and another 29 students were studying at the Eastern District Chinese Women's Normal School. Ninety-three people studied at the Chinese Department of the Hong Kong Special Night College. In addition, six people studied at the University of Hong Kong and received government scholarships. (4) Higher Education and Vocational Education: Two women obtained scholarships from the University of Hong Kong. There are female students in the night college, a total of 146 people.</p>
<p>Physical Education and Other School Health This year has been expanded, and there is now one health officer, three assistant health officers, one female medical officer, one health inspector, and fifteen nurses. The physical education aspect of subsidized schools has continued to improve this year, and there has been a significant change in the attitude and methods of physical education. Special physical education classes for male and female teachers were held during the summer to improve school physical education standards. Now, students in the Education Department and Normal School are required to take remedial physical education classes, but the lack of sports fields in Hong Kong is the main shortcoming of physical education classes. Efforts are now being made to remedy this. All schools in Hong Kong established a concert society this year and held several performances. Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, and St. John Ambulance Brigade are all interested. There are currently eight Girl Scout teams in schools, with a total of 197 people, and three Boy Scout teams with a total of 43 people. Fifty-two people participated in the ambulance team, including four teachers. This session has also made considerable progress in film education, slide explanations, and film exhibitions. From October 1940 to September 1941, 25,401 students and 3172 other people watched such films. One hundred to one hundred and fifty educational films are shown every month. The Teachers' Union and the British Far East Intelligence Bureau have provided assistance. There are currently a total of 64 types of educational films, silent and sound. It is expected that this will triple in the next twelve months. There are also two projectors.</p>
<p>Future Prospects and Goals The most urgent need to implement at present is to expand Chinese primary school education, especially the education of children from poor families. There are two ways to do this: to increase the number of official schools or to subsidize private primary schools. A "ten-year plan" has been drafted for the former, and a subsidy regulation has been drafted for the latter, which has been approved by the Education Committee and the Hong Kong Government. In addition, it is planned to establish a rural normal school. The problem of sports fields in urban schools has been made into a form by the Director of Education and sent to the urban design officer for reference. Once the subsidy regulations are approved, Hong Kong education will have reasonable development. The curriculum of English schools is currently being expanded to include manual arts and singing. Elementary science knowledge will also be taught in lower grades. The curriculum of Chinese schools and the Chinese classes of English schools are currently being studied by a special committee. After the report is drafted, it will be reconsidered. (End)</p>

<h3>"It Doesn't Matter If People Die" Theory</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>There's a common saying in Shanghai these days: "It doesn't matter if people die." This is an extremely vicious phrase. Those who utter it generously apply it to others, and their attitude is quite carefree, calling it "doesn't matter," meaning "transcendental"!</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if people die" is just an empty phrase; however, there are those who express it through actions in this time and place. The past few days have seen some particularly brilliant displays on the trams: (1) A ticket seller, failing to extract a bribe, became enraged and, as the tram was moving, violently pushed a passenger, causing him to fall to the ground, hit his head, bleed profusely, and die. The ticket seller just laughed it off, "It doesn't matter if people die" (see the 16th's report). (2) A female passenger with a child entered the tram, and due to the crowding, bumped into the ticket seller, receiving a heavy beating in return. "It doesn't matter if people die," let alone the face of an infant (see the 18th's report)?</p>
<p>It's not like there's an irreconcilable feud, wanting someone to die. If they don't die, you still have to fight it out with them. However, when a third party can't stand it and wants to "care," they often end up being the ones punished.</p>
<p>In the former case (the passenger's death), the ticket seller leisurely rang the bell "twice" and then "himself" (?) opened the tram door and jumped off calmly? In the latter case, a mere woman was holding a child in one hand. How could she tear off the ticket seller's tall hat? But regardless of whether someone is "pushed down" or someone's hat is "torn," there are always righteous witnesses on the tram to solemnly testify to the event.</p>
<p>The "it doesn't matter if people die" actions are terrible, but "the living ultimately can't bear it." Fortunately, third parties step forward to uphold justice. Some students from a certain school and passengers in a first-class car can be moved by righteous indignation to stand up and reluctantly act as witnesses. This is certainly commendable, especially in a world where people often embrace the philosophy of "better to do less than to do more" or even "it doesn't matter if people die." Even the wronged souls would surely be endlessly grateful.</p>
<p>Of course, not all ticket sellers are black as crows. If there is a fault, correct it; if not, be encouraged. If you "protect your own kind and insult passengers as a group," you will only give people a permanently black impression, leading to no distinction between jade and stone, thinking that they are all crows. Furthermore, tram passengers rising up to form collective patrols is a form of passive resistance. Only when the authorities fundamentally resolve the issue... what can be done to prevent future deception?</p>
<p>Social Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Want a Quiet Meal? Go to the "Student Cafeteria"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>Rice also sells for $117 per dan (approx. 100 liters). It seems that ordinary wage earners and young academics need at least two dollars to fill their stomachs, considering current market prices. (This refers to those who can't return home for meals.)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Student Cafeteria was created in response to this need. This cafeteria is sponsored by the YMCA's Student Relief Committee, and the funding comes entirely from the committee's fundraising efforts. The purpose of the cafeteria is to reduce the burden on academics and professionals.</p>
<p>The cafeteria officially opened in early September on the second floor of the Chinese YMCA at 599 Sichuan Road. The cafeteria is located in a corridor, and the boards on both sides are painted with white paint. Three fluorescent lights further illuminate the corridor, making it bright and eye-catching. Several tables about vitamin content ratios in various foods and human weight/height comparison charts are posted on the walls. Walking through the short corridor, the hall appears before you. The snow-white walls and milky white tables and chairs make this cafeteria very harmonious and bright.</p>
<p>The student cafeteria has established a cafeteria covenant. The three most important items are: (1) Take your own bowls and plates (2) Maintain order (3) Maintain cleanliness.</p>
<p>Regarding management: The cafeteria is modeled after a common American restaurant. Diners take their own bowls and plates. The method is for diners to take a rectangular white iron tray, take their bowls and chopsticks, and then go to the side, where several large trays of the day's dishes are lined up. A waiter scoops the dishes into the tray according to the diner's instructions, and then the diner pays and eats. The advantages of this method are: (1) saves time and effort (2) diners do it themselves to avoid trouble. In addition, the management of the cafeteria is relatively easy. In ordinary cafeterias, waiters are constantly coming and going, and the cafeteria is filled with smoke and disorder. However, the student cafeteria is different. All you see are two waiters scooping dishes and one waiter serving rice, all wearing white uniforms. In addition, there is a cashier and a female manager taking care of the entire cafeteria.</p>
<p>Order and cleanliness are also special features of this cafeteria. Ordinary cafeterias are disorderly, with shouting and noise filling the room. Diners simply can't find a moment of peace. Some even spit phlegm and spill tea, making a mess. However, such bad phenomena do not exist in the YMCA student cafeteria. You feel quiet as soon as you walk in. If you want to eat a quiet meal, this is a good place!</p>
<p>Lunch and dinner cost $1.40 per meal. If you are not financially well-off, you can reportedly receive preferential coupons from the YMCA!</p>
<h3>Gilded Figures</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Around 1 PM, "Bang!" The door of the small room slammed shut. "Whack, whack..." A rattan cane landed on flesh. This was followed by suppressed sobbing. I guessed that the unfortunate person was being beaten again. In the evening, a familiar person lightly slipped down the stairs. Everything else was the same, except her eyes were swollen like walnuts, and her face was bruised. Her hair was short, sticking up on her head like a spring meadow. In the darkness, she barely looked human. I knew these were the marks left by the rattan cane. She began to sob, "Because I told you who the country guest was who came today, she beat me like this..." I felt very indignant, but also a little angry, and even a little amused. I didn't believe there could be such a stupid person in the world!</p>
<p>Poverty isn't shameful. As long as you don't steal, don't rob, don't do anything that harms heaven and earth, then what does poverty matter? Those people are, after all, extraordinary, and Shanghai is a place that values appearances. The arrival of such a rustic, unsophisticated poor relative is no wonder seen as a great shame. But if this poor relative hadn't come, people wouldn't have valued her either. Just by listening to the words she constantly mutters and looking at her face, you can be sure she's a mean-spirited person.</p>
<h3>Fragments of the Solar Eclipse</h3>
<p>— Shi Hua</p>
<p>This year's solar eclipse is far more precious than those in previous years. It is said that such a total solar eclipse is visible only three times every thousand years in one location, or once every three hundred and sixty years. Reports say it is only visible once every few decades, which is still an understatement of its rarity.</p>
<p>The path of this solar eclipse starts 200 li south of Yili, Xinjiang, and passes through Gansu, Qinghai, Fujian, and out to sea at Xiapu, totaling over one hundred counties in eight provinces.</p>
<p>The eclipse began at 11:15 AM (Central China Standard Time) and traveled 4,000 kilometers across China, taking one hour and twenty minutes.</p>
<p>During this eclipse, Wuhan and its three towns were directly in the center of the total eclipse zone, and the time coincided with noon, making the phenomenon extremely noteworthy. The residents of the three towns can experience the most dramatic situation at that time. Although Chongqing cannot see the total eclipse, it can see nine-tenths of it.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) A total solar eclipse on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>Tales of the Past</p>
<h3>Biographical Notes on the Case of the Civet Cat</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Three: Consort Li Chen</p>
<p>Consort Li Chen, a native of Hangzhou, was the birth mother of Emperor Renzong and a maidservant of Empress Liu. Emperor Zhenzong appointed her as the keeper of the bedchamber. The keeper of the bedchamber is a female servant official. Before emperors marry, they first choose an older woman from the palace maids to serve them, which is customary for female servants in the palace. Just like Xiren, Qingwen, and Sheyue in the Dream of the Red Chamber, who were variations of the four officials. Empress Liu was most favored by Emperor Zhenzong, and Consort Li was the keeper of the bedchamber for Empress Liu, so Emperor Zhenzong knew that Consort Li was pregnant; how could Empress Liu's inability to bear children be hidden from Emperor Zhenzong? The novel fabricated the story of a civet cat replacing the true pearl because they were unaware that Consort Li was a palace maid of Empress Liu. At that time, Emperor Zhenzong was eager for a son, and seeing that Consort Li was pregnant, he hoped that the child would be a boy. He once went to the Linqi Terrace, and Consort Li's jade hairpin suddenly fell down. The Consort felt ominous, but the Emperor saw that the hairpin remained intact, suggesting that the child born would be a boy. When the attendants retrieved the hairpin, it was indeed undamaged, and the Emperor was delighted. Later, she gave birth to Emperor Renzong, was granted the title of Lady of Chongyang County, and gave birth to another daughter, who did not survive. She was promoted to Talent and later to Concubine Wan. From this historical fact, it is clear that Consort Li gave birth to Emperor Renzong, which is a publicly recorded fact. Therefore, as soon as Consort Li gave birth to a son, she was promoted from keeper of the bedchamber to Lady of Chongyang County, and then to Talent and Concubine Wan. All of these events occurred during the reign of Emperor Zhenzong. If it were truly a civet cat replacing the prince, would Consort Li have enjoyed such glory? Moreover, it was not only known in the palace and by the imperial uncle (Eighth Prince), but also by ministers (such as Lv Yijian and others). The only one who didn't know was Emperor Renzong himself. Empress Liu didn't want Emperor Renzong to know, precisely because of Empress Liu's political strategies and her desire to maintain power! Therefore, Emperor Renzong's upbringing was entrusted by Empress Liu to Consort Yang, who took care of him. Consort Yang and Empress Liu were originally in the same rank and were good at catering to Empress Liu, so Empress Liu trusted her and took the child from the hands of the maids and raised him with Consort Yang. This was because Empress Liu didn't want the biological mother to raise her own child and isolate the mother and son's feelings, fearing that one day the child would seize her position and disobey her orders. Although Consort Li was promoted to Consort Shun when Emperor Renzong ascended the throne, she still remained quietly among the concubines of the previous dynasty, not wanting to stand out. Everyone in the palace feared the Empress Dowager, and no one dared to speak out. Even the unwavering Eighth Prince was still afraid of being resented by Empress Liu and deeply regretted his actions. The rest can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Twelve: Unexpected Turmoil</p>
<p>"Now you lie down for a while longer, and I'll go out for an hour or two and come back and drink millet porridge with you." After watching Qiu Haitang drink down a large bowl of medicinal juice, Yu Kun said to him with a smile. Finally, he added, "Today, I also brought a large piece of Jinhua ham!"</p>
<p>He said he would be out for an hour or two, but in fact, he didn't return until nine o'clock.</p>
<p>"What? Old Three, so stingy! You didn't even buy me a bottle of Wu Jiapi wine!" This time when Yu Kun came back, he didn't seem as concerned as before. Looking at the small plate of ham that Zhang Laoliu steamed for him, he kept clamoring for wine.</p>
<p>Today, Qiu Haitang's spirits were indeed much higher because a good friend had suddenly come to visit and he had drunk another dose of medicine. Before Yu Kun returned, he had already leaned against the bed and drunk half a bowl of millet porridge by himself.</p>
<p>"Okay, Old Liu, quickly go and buy four taels of Wu Jiapi for Master Second!" he shouted from the room inside with a smile.</p>
<p>"I say you're stingy, and it's really true! Who are you inviting to drink with four taels of wine?" Yu Kun said as he tossed a dollar to Zhang Laoliu. "I'll pay for it, but we're going to drink until we're happy!"</p>
<p>Once he started drinking, Yu Kun's old temper came out in full force. Separated by a wall, Qiu Haitang could constantly hear him humming various tunes. At the same time, he was unreservedly joking with Zhang Laoliu, talking about everything from matters in the fields to women's affairs, saying anything and everything. (215)</p>

<h3>Hobbies of Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Everyone inevitably has a few hobbies to adjust the monotony of daily life. Hollywood stars are certainly no exception. To be honest, most stars' hobbies can be included in the normal range. Below are a few introductions to established stars:</p>
<p>Myrna Loy spends most of her spare time growing flowers in her own garden. In addition, she has an orchard, and it is said that the various vegetables she now eats are all produced by this orchard.</p>
<p>Judy Garland has a special love for music and has collected nearly two thousand records over the past decade. Judy is also a painter. Last year, she gave a painting as a gift to her mother.</p>
<p>Maureen O'Sullivan's only pastime in her spare time is browsing books on child psychology. She believes that in order to make a child's development satisfactory, one must first understand their psychology. She also applies this principle to educating her own children.</p>
<p>"Queen of Song" Jeanette MacDonald likes to collect fans of all styles. She often invites relatives and friends to admire these treasures. Recently, an 82-year-old fan gave the singer a fan she used at her wedding sixty-eight years ago, and attached a note: "Because you are a representative of beauty, I am giving you this ivory fan today."</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney has been truly popular in Hollywood recently. Because he is in his prime, he is enthusiastic about all activities. In terms of movement, he excels at ping-pong, football, and swimming. In terms of stillness, he is preparing to write his own biography. His literary works have already been published in newspapers and magazines. It's no wonder that such a talent has caused a sensation throughout Hollywood!</p>

<h3>Blood Rain and Exquisite Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Taking a Delicate Bird Out of its Cage Early</p>
<p>Just at this moment, a guard under Wu Sangui came in and reported, "The old General at home has sent someone to tell the General to return because another imperial edict has arrived, urging the General to go through the pass." Wu Sangui hastily waved his hand, telling the guard to leave. He then said to Tian Hongyu, "Thank you for inviting me to drink tonight, and for giving me Yuanyuan as a gift. Not only have I been satisfied with wine, but also with virtue, and given beauty. I am extremely grateful. However, I cannot stay longer due to official duties. Please bid farewell to Yuanyuan. I will certainly protect your residence in the future. Please do not worry." Tian Hongyu said, "Very well, but the old man was unprepared to prepare dowry for Yuanyuan on short notice. How about the old man send Yuanyuan to your door tomorrow?" Wu Sangui shook his head and said, "There is no need for that. Please prepare an oil-painted carriage and carry Yuanyuan with me. I have already received great kindness and dare not accept the dowry. Please forgive my impoliteness." As he spoke, he stood up. Yuanyuan was still sitting to the side, leaning her delicate body. Tonight's banquet was originally her own ingenious plan, just to catch a glimpse of that handsome young Marquis, but who knew that her ideal would become a reality. Hongfu didn't have to elope, and she was actually going to go with this romantic general. Naturally, she couldn't express the immense joy in her heart, but she remained calm and didn't show any emotion. Tian Hongyu saw that Wu Sangui was eager to leave and couldn't persuade him to stay, so he had to follow Wu Sangui's instructions and hurriedly ordered his servants to prepare an oil-painted carriage, harnessed with fine horses, to send Yuanyuan away. In a short while, the carriages and horses were ready. Wu Sangui took Yuanyuan in his arms and said goodbye to Tian Hongyu. Yuanyuan also didn't have time to change her makeup, and just wore the light-colored clothes she had on, and went with Wu Sangui. Tian Hongyu sent them outside the door, watching Yuanyuan get into the oil-painted carriage. Once the curtain was lowered, he couldn't see her beautiful figure again. Wu Sangui jumped onto his saddle, said "goodbye" to Tian Hongyu again, and gave a shake to the reins, saying "Let's go." Four guards led the way in front with large canopy lights, closely followed by the oil-painted carriage. Wu Sangui's horse followed behind the carriage. The sound of the wheels and the horses' hooves traveled forward to the main road. In a flash, they turned a corner and disappeared from sight. (174)</p>
