<h3 id="c25">美日再作會談 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>於美日談話入於靜止狀態的五日中，華盛頓束京和倫敦三地所傳出的消息，對於南太平洋局勢，莫不一致認為極端嚴重，自東條發表「掃蕩」英美在東亞權益之演說後，世人益增其幽鬱情緒。乃昨日華盛頓電訊，羅斯福已取消其溫泉休假，匆遽返京，同時，日本特使已於昨日會晤赫爾國務卿，繼續美日談話，雙方所談的內容，在此際無從懸揣，而華盛頓的電訊，除上述各點外，也絲毫無所透露，惟稱觀察家預料東方危機將在四十八小時內，作最後的決定，無疑地，靜止五日的美日談話，在波譎雲詭衆說囂囂之氛圍下，又將轉入另一緊張局面。</p>
<p>關於美日談話的經過，本報已迭有指陳，惟以事態方在進展，無由作過早之推闡，僅就日本以往動向，剖析其實際遭過，今日方特使與赫爾繼續會談，在此所謂四十八小時和戰關頭，吾人願以觀感所及，衡情度理，再試作一般之檢討：目前日本的處境，有很多內在的矛盾心理，戰旣不能，和又不願。如果日本情願不顧一切，以國運下最後的賭注，則ABCD陣綫的强大，自未敢估計太低；而其中最不利的條件，厥為日本必須在幾個前錢作戰，陷入一個被包圍的形勢中。綜觀最近數個月來民治國家在南太平洋所作軍事上的佈置，簡直時時在作堅强防禦，絲毫未曾放鬆，英屬馬來亞的海空防衛，已築成一個堅銳的陣營，可不具諭，拿緬甸說，則最近有大批英軍及印度軍開抵仰光增防，其中包含各種軍士，且有許多曾在他處戰塲服役者。菲島方面的軍事佈置，美人也始終未予忽視，除不斷以大量軍械運抵菲島充實防務外，並於領海四週佈置水雷，近頃更以菲軍正式編入美軍，準備應付任何事變。泰國已一再正吿世界，具有有保衛領土主權，抵抗侵略的決心，香港於此二日中且舉行防務演習，參加者有民防工作員二萬餘人，一切已成戰時狀態。以言中國，則與日周旋了將近五年的持久戰，已足予日本以豐富經騐，故日本處於這種楚歌四面的環境下，一定要衝破民治陣錢的包圍，應付幾個前錢，其成敗利鈍之數，眞太無把握。至於作戰期內，補充造船材料的無從取得，國內各地的慘遭空襲，那又是可以想像而得之事了。</p>
<p>戰旣不利，和又却非所願。日本處心積慮，殆無時不謀解決中國事變，一面又憧憬於德國的局部勝利：且又禁不住納粹的百般引誘，故於美國之堅定立塲，誠有依違兩難之感。吾人目前所欲指明者，赫爾對來栖所提出之文件，係美國一貫政策，希望將遠東整個事件，於談判中全部解決，不願再有枝枝節節的問題成為懸案；所謂遠束整個事件，尤着重於日軍從中國撤退。美國並且再三聲明，赫爾所提交的文件，乃美國方面之最後一步動作，至於第二步動作，應由日方為之，這意思就是說，美國的全部意見已盡於此，並不容再有所謂討價還價的餘地。現在再作會談，是否針對着赫爾的牒文而僅僅乎以「是」或「否」相答復，抑或另有其他新的建議提出，在此時實無由推論，不過美國持有堅決的立塲，殆非虛聲恫嚇和任何不切實際的提議所可變更，這是世人所一致公認的。</p>
<p>在東方孤立無援的軸心同盟者，旣不欲戰，又不欲和，目前確已遭逢空前未有的嚴重時期，誠如日藏相賀屋所言，日本如在華失敗，則前途將不堪設想，華北固將失去其現在之形式，滿洲或亦不免，目前日本稍一錯誤，卽將回復至一八九五年之地位，手足均受束縛，不能活動於各島之外。賀屋的見解，十足把日本內在矛盾的心理和現在處境的窘迫，加以具體的說明。根據上所具述，日本對於美日談判，似仍有所期待，不欲立時使其決裂，目前唯一的願望，就是把這一個談判，儘量設法去拖延，至於能否拖延或拖延至怎樣程度，皆在未定之天。再論及美國所將採取的步驟，是不作預先任何警吿，對日本施行全面經濟封銷，同時對於中國，必依租軍政策，加緊施行，倘遇任何阻碍，卽訴諸武力，亦所不惜。最後可以說，美日談判，終必歸於失敗，在談話的過程中間，時而緊張，時而鬆弛，尙有許多次的嚴重局面，陸續演映至最後總失敗而後已。</p>
<p>中國對於美日談話，自始卽堅持無所成就的觀點，眼前所已有的事實，都已證明預料之不虛，然而中國信賴美國，信賴各民治國，尤其認為惟有援助中國奮戰到底，始有解除遠東危機的希望。</p>

<p>關於赫斯瘋狂的聲明，是由希特勒自己口授的，他在知道赫斯出亡後數小時，方始發布這一道命令，可知他必已經過考慮，並非一時之誤。他把這個聲明口授給德國情報主任狄特立克。這位希特勒寵臣便柔聲怡色的向他說道，德國人也許要奇怪瘋狂已經一載的人，為什麼還留仟副元首之職。希特勒聽了，便握拳擊桌，大聲叱駡狄特立克這一班人太覺無禮，一定要把這個聲明照樣發表。</p>
<p>狄特立克不得已便把這聲明交由德意志通信社發報機上送出去。不料發到一半，中途忽又停止。原來是宣傳部中有人讀到了，便過來把他們止住。當宣傳部員把這件事報吿郭培爾時，郭培爾却說道，這是上頭的命令，祇有照辦。</p>
<p>假使這一條聲明，用意果在破壞黨的信用，結果是成功了，我在次日費了整天工夫，在商店裏，公園裏，出差汽車裏，酒排間裏，上等公寓裏，和許多德國人談話，詢問他們對於赫斯出亡一事的意見。他們於赫斯出亡的原因，祇能加以猜測，惟獨對於黨部則一致非難，說黨中把一個瘋人保留作希特勒戈林以下的第三位元首繼承人，試問還像個付麼機關。</p>
<p>對美戰爭在德國靑年亦是一個重大打擊。郭培爾雖然痛斥美國祇是一種「汽車，無綫電，爵士音樂，五分一角商店，和猶太財閥的文化，」德國靑年則仍以美國為一個奇妙不可思議的地方，有摩天樓，汽車，大學，電影明星和跳舞遊戲。以上種種，德國靑年皆以為比較本國要優美得多。他們在國內不准跳舞，也聽不到爵士音樂，除非甘冒生命危險，去收聽倫敦或莫斯科的播音。他們在國內也不准吸烟，不准用化妝品，並不准游戲。他們必須隨時隨地的奉命工作，他們至少須有四個孩子，凡此一切，都是為了要使祖國獲得更大的光榮。然而美國祇是他們夢寐追求的地方，却並不是戰爭角逐的塲所。</p>
<p>一個美國人在柏林仍可操英語，而不致激怒德國人。我們夫婦倆常在大庭廣衆之間說着英語，祇有一次曾引起反對，而反對的人却是一個醉漢。</p>
<p>某星期日晚，我妻與一個瑞典新聞記者同行排列，想買最後一班的地下火車票回家。前面有一個身體魁梧的中年男子回過身來，把兩隻熏紅的眼睛釘着他們道，「說德國話」。這位瑞典記者所說的德語，像德國人一樣純熟，就向他說明我妻是美國人，不是英國人，她還不能用德語談話。那個醉漢却說道，「我可不管這些。他要說德國話。這裏是德國，他一定要說德國話。」一個立在我妻後面的德國人聽不過，便開口向那醉漢質問道，「她是個美國人，她要說英國話，就可以說英國話。」醉漢說「不行。」另一個人一定說「行。」他們兩人便離開行列，由激烈爭辯而至於跳浪叫囂。羣衆亦立刻表示態度，分別作左右袒，可是差不多全體多贊成「美國人在柏林可說英國話」一種主張。最後因火車到來，彼此急於登車，爭論也就隨之吿一段落。</p>
<p>今年德國春天氣候，大部份還像冬天一般的寒冷。公寓裏的煤。規定於五月一日起停止供給，不再補充。豈知五月九日竟然下雪，十一日又雪。十四日雨雪雹三者併下。我聽見一個德國兵向法國俘虜抱歉的說，這種天氣在德國是難得的。及至五月下旬，又忽然夏日炎炎，自此直至我離開德國的時候，總是天晴而熱。</p>
<p>柏林動物園中，孩子們都在不耐煩地等着輪流去看那頭海象羅倫特，牠好似動物中的前敵總司令一般。</p>
<p>每逢星期五六兩日，上午八時至十二時之間，公寓的庭院裏，祇聽見拍！拍！拍！一陣陣拍毯聲，震人耳鼓，因為依照命令，地毯祇准在這個時候拍灰塵呀。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c73">英國第一流圖畫幽默刊物　笨拙雜誌百年紀念 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 王仲鄂</p>
<p>笨拙雜誌（Punch）出版至本年度巳達百年紀念。這是一本現在尙在繼續刊行的老牌幽默雜誌。笨拙自一八四一年七月十七日發刊以迄今日，從未有一星期停過。上次歐戰期問，該刋仍賡續發行，而在此次戰爭中，歐洲僅有少數國家能自由歡笑，英國亦為其中之。在波佛利街的殘瓦頽垣之中，笨拙雜誌精美的建築仍完好無恙，不過底層全給沙袋國困住；雖然英國現在的日子是在流血，流汗，流淚中打發過去，更兼紙張缺乏，但不曾阻礙這個代表笨拙雜誌的駝背老人發出每周一次的喀嘻哈哈。</p>
<p>現在要去笨拙的編輯部，必須在彈片四散的路上小心擇路，因此只得徒步而往。因為波佛利街有一段兩端挿了紅旗，禁止車輛通過。等你擠入笨拙前門的沙袋障礙物後，你就到達一間地位寬大的屋子，有如一座舊式的鄉下大厦——地板上鋪了柔軟的地氈，牆上裝飾的是油畫，還有一座廣大的圓形扶梯。窗外沙袋纍纍，室內顯得極暗，電燈光閃閃爍爍，光綫黯淡，像維多利亞時代的煤氣燈管。雷梯停止工作，電話鈴亦寂寂無聲。</p>
<p>樓上編輯部只减至二人——編輯諾克斯，和一個助編。另外一個編輯已厠身行伍，仍繼續為笨拙撰述文字，描寫海陸空軍生活的外來文稿日見增多。但是封面上著名的駝背老人及其伴侶泰倍狗坐在矮子花園中的圖畫，自一八四　年刊載以來，仍一如疇昔。</p>
<p>不過這是眞的，笨拙篇幅較前略為縮小。文字部份由每期二十八頁减至二十四頁，以後或許還要縮减。戰前銷數十二萬五千份，現因紙張缺乏，只銷十萬份。自戰事開始後，該刊每周以全頁地位勸募海陸空軍慰勞金。</p>
<p>就文字的質而言，笨拙已在數年前擺脫了如同戴了一副染色眼鏡的保守中義。該刊的藝術家描畫下等階級總像惡漢一樣，在近數年中，笨拙已向十字街頭進展，不久，有一較新的畫家，題材巳選取到上流社會，畫起來並不如往常習慣一般，但却塗上一對歪斜的眼睛，作為特色。</p>
<p>血與汗使前進的步伐增速。舊時職務和利益的變化多端巳屬過去。今天男女老幼，各色人等都做着相同的事情。笨拙遂成為一本年輕的，更易瞭解的雜誌，居然能在波佛利街上的殘垣裏，沙袋包住的家中慶祝其喜劇式的白年紀念。笨拙現在比從前較側重政治，雖然在這一方面的叙述，正與其他方面一樣，只把現代景象中升起來的一縷烟霧加以描寫而已。該刊著名撰述人之一赫勃德現為國家右翼人物，常以笨拙爲政治講壇，但此公的保守主義已不再代表笨拙編輯部的意見。笨拙仍舊適合各階層的口味，但此口味與正義感的憤怒不復自相矛盾。</p>
<p>人們在慶祝其期頣誕辰時，還有一點特別値得重視。當笨拙呱呱誕生時，維多利亞還在妙齡，海峽對岸的法國人，都戴高帽子，歡喜吃田雞。</p>
<p>假如你今天翻翻以前的笨拙舊籍，你可以見到白年來川圖畫，散文，詩歌所表現出英國的故事，生動活潑，實較之任何正經歷史典籍為甚。你可以見到舊式咖啡店中靠背很高的坐椅，你可以見到舊式浴間中高大的唧筒，倫敦板球塲中球員所戴的高頂帽子。你可以見到一八五〇年時婦女穿着用鋼箍張　的裙子，男子頰旁的長髯，最初的捲烟，最初的跑冰鞋，最初的小形自由車，最初的網球與電話。你可以知道擴大的襯裙收縮成緊身的裙子，一八八〇年代審美家對於睡蓮一無生氣的醉心。你可以知道一八八○年婦女歡喜無休止的運動，至十九世紀才發展成示威行動，主張婦女參政。紙牌的「橋」戲，高而夫球，汽車等開始流行。自來水管，出差汽車，公共汽車的震撼倫教。乒乓與陀螺等玩具風行着，以排遣閑暇。於是來了第一次世界大戰。</p>
<p>說起笨拙，一定要發生這樣一個問題：「但是這本書是滑稽的嗎？」立刻就可以這樣答覆，如其與美國的紐約客雜誌相比，那是無用想到笨拙的。二本雜誌的性質完全不同。這也可以說英國的幽默是豐富與卓越的變化之生長。伊麗莎白文體的流風所被，是對於音樂廳及吸烟室的愛好，但於笨拙，則上述二者都屬禁例。駝背老人所給予人們者是一本幽靜的，卓越的幽默雜誌，此雜誌永不描述不足道的事物。對於笨拙想獲一適切的瞭解，也許要想及該刊一八九一年時五十周年紀念，一次莊嚴的宗敎性慶祝，在那次慶祝中並無唱一首讚美歌等儀式，祈禱者在祝禱結束時有這樣的語句：「由詼諧而流於邪惡極為容易，因詼諧而進入智慧却非常艱難。」</p>

<p>— 宇楨</p>
<p>今年九月六日南斯拉夫國王彼得二世十八歲成年誕辰，英倫各國皇室人員，政府領袖，外交家及軍官們，會齊集聖保羅大敎堂替他做壽。同時官員們特設招待會，替他慶賀，其時彼得穿了空軍上校的制服，英氣勃勃，當塲宣佈他巳宣誓祖國一日不恢復自由，一日不跳舞。</p>
<p>這位年少翩翩的君主，自去年四月納粹進兵南斯拉夫後流亡到倫敦，生性愛好跳舞，尤其歡喜美國的舞曲。當他在本國陸軍大學肄業的時候，就學習各種新式的舞蹈，技術成熟，在交際塲中，口碑載道。現在他能毅然決然停止跳舞，努力求學，以待祖國光復，正是小可多得的明君。比之上海這輩「孤島男女」，眞有霄壞之別了。</p>
<p>彼得　世最歡喜學習的功課，聽說是航空，但今秋進劍橋大學讀書後，恐怕要把它暫時擱置了。</p>

<h3 id="c75">煤毒 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 再</p>
<p>煤毒即是一氧化碳，一氧化碳是性質極毒的氣體，若空氣中含有容積十萬分之一，即可使人受毒。假使他的成分達到八百分之一以上，半小時內即可致死的。所以人假使受了煤毒，是很容易死的。即使他知道已中了煤毒，也不能呼救或脫逃，因為血球中之血色素巳與一氧化碳化合，而成穩定的紅色物質，使血球失去功效。所以中煤毒的人的精神，巳人半昏迷狀態，故種種機能幾乎全部停止作用。於是中煤毒的人常有極力掙扎至床邊或地上而死去的事發生。</p>
<p>每年冬天總有人因怕冷而把窗門都關起來，而把煤爈放在房中以取暖，因此而死的人，每年必有數次。這是大衆太沒有常識的橡故。</p>
<p>我們要知道，吸烟也要吸進煤毒的，所以你看「老槍們，臉上血色一點都沒有，節直與白紙無異，這因為他們吸烟時，一口氣就吸上半段，因此烟葉等燃燒不完全而變成一氣化碳吸下，雖然那是不會立刻致死的，但也是「老槍」們早死的一個原因。</p>
<p>冬天就到了，我希望今年中煤毒的人少一點吧！</p>
<h3 id="c76">秋海棠 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>

<p>十五爸爸，賣唱去吧！</p>
<p>他這一　當然沒有料錯，但梅寳的聰明說不僅能够從這幾句話裏，斷定秋海棠向日所以唱掃邊老生的話是假的，實際上是在那裏充武行，而且她還明白她父親為什麽要這樣誆她的理由，主要的一條，當然就是為了生活；所以她在張銀財走後，並沒有就向秋海棠揭破，祇當不曾聽見一樣。</p>
<p>可是從這一天起，梅寳心裏的苦悶，便越發加深了，一方面她要盡心竭力的侍候她父親，希望他早日復原，一方面她還得不露聲色的作種種佈置，預先設法解決未來的生活，免得她父親病好以後，再回紅舞台去充打英雄。</p>
<p>錢若默是來過一次了，梅寳還在一路送他出去的時候，切實向他請求過，希望他能想出一條好的計較來，替她父女倆解決一個大間題</p>
<p>「照你父親近來的體格看，要吃戲飯是不成的了！」錢若默先把半截雪茄烟很熱練地移到了左邊的嘴角上去，然後回頭來很沉着地向梅實說：「你這樣年輕，又有相當學識，在平時，要找一個位置本來很容易；但現在，你是知道的，咱們軍隊已經撤退了，租界裏的情形也非常混亂，報館都有結束的消息，我叉怎麽能把你胡亂介紹出去呢？」（二七七）</p>

<h3 id="c77">英子，史原，及其他「鳳娃」重演前奏 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 木風</p>
<p>有一種演員擅長着或悲或喜或活潑或股肅的風格，落入定型化，同時一種演員，則兼擅着多重作風，成多角式的。我們不能從這上面檢討誰是誰非，一個演員不論定型化或多角式，祇要理解到劇中人的性格，做得出放得開，那就不會不接近成功的途徑的。</p>
<p>說英子吧，他在「家」中演鳴鳳一角，大家對於他一股內心深蓄着的悲鬱的情緒控制着，叉兼外形恰如一個孤零的弱女子，無疑地，她是將鳴鳳演成功。然而，「邊城故事」中的「鳳娃是一個活潑伶俐的而父多情的小姑娘，她又以完全相反的風格演出，而且演得那樣自然可愛，一點沒有鳴鳳的氣氛，這，可證她是個具有多角的演技的演員，能做能放，並不流露一點勉强的勁兒。</p>
<p>再說史原，他是將「邊城故事」中的老苟，活生生刻劃着，半山東化的語調更强論着這一個，又忠實，又忠實的人兒，但正因如此，「蛻變中的　昌，「阿Ｑ正傳中的阿Ｑ，無形中間仍表現在老茍的形象來了，這裏，他現在固可又重演最拿手的老苟，不過希望他落入定型後，索性在這一種型化的戲上努力，此外，角色可以選擇一下，以避不對工了。</p>
<p>上海職業劇圍將重演改名「鳳娃的「邊城故事」，似乎有所感觸，把這兩個人作一雙問題人物寫上了，我想，多數愛好話劇的讀者，也有一些兒同感吧？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan Seeks to Avoid War, Decides to Continue Negotiations with the US, While Also Announcing Suspension of Troop Deployment to Vietnam, Hull and Kurusu Re-Engage in Talks <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 1st – The Cabinet held an emergency meeting this morning. Foreign Minister Togo reported on the recent state of US-Japan talks. After lengthy discussions, it was decided to continue talks in Washington until the "last second." According to Domei News Agency, while the US and Japan have significantly different viewpoints on fundamental principles, the Japanese government has decided to continue talks to maintain peace in the Pacific and urge the United States to reconsider its attitude.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 1st – Saigon Radio announced that Japanese special envoy Yoshizawa met with Vietnamese Governor Decoux for an hour and a half yesterday. It is said that the Japanese government has decided to temporarily suspend the deployment of troops to Vietnam. It is also reported that Yoshizawa informed Governor Decoux that the Japanese army does not intend to use Vietnam as a base to attack Thailand or the Burma Road.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 1st – Japanese representatives Kurusu and Nomura continued talks with Secretary of State Hull today. Kurusu told reporters that he did not bring a final response to Hull's document. Regarding mentions of Prime Minister Tojo's statements about the need to eliminate British and American interference in East Asia, Kurusu replied that he believed these statements had been misquoted and that they were seeking the full text of the speech from Tokyo. Kurusu also gave an inconclusive answer to reporters' questions about Japan's preparations to invade Thailand, saying he had no knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 1st – President Roosevelt originally intended to stay at Warm Springs, Georgia, for a short rest, but due to the situation in the Far East, he has now decided to leave the resort immediately and return to the White House. This decision was made after lengthy telephone conversations with Secretary of State Hull. Whether this is a prelude to new action regarding the crisis in the American Pacific, or merely reflects the President's concern for the situation, official circles are not disclosing. Yesterday morning, British Ambassador Halifax also met with Hull at the State Department to discuss the Far East issue. A State Department spokesperson said they had a general discussion. Hull remained in his office all morning, receiving the latest reports on the Pacific crisis. The State Department has not yet received a reply from Japan to Hull's note. Japanese special envoy Kurusu is still in Washington, and it is expected that the President may meet with Nomura and Kurusu once more.</p>
<p>Reuters Special Correspondent, Washington, 1st – President Roosevelt's sudden decision to return to the White House from Warm Springs due to the Far East situation has made people here feel the extreme seriousness of a possible outbreak in the Pacific. Prime Minister Tojo's speech on Saturday, calling for the expulsion of British and American people from Asia, though intended to encourage the nation, has made people prepare for a worsening of the situation. It is felt that the President would not have suddenly returned to Washington unless the diplomatic intelligence from the Far East indicated a very grim situation. Perhaps Tojo's remarks have revealed the nature of the Japanese cabinet's reply to the memorandum presented by the United States on Wednesday. The official reply has not yet been delivered to Washington. If the nature of the Japanese reply is as such, then any action by Tokyo would be enough to ignite the largest conflagration ever seen in the Pacific. The United States has no intention of going to war with Japan, but Americans are united in supporting the government's firm stance. If Japan insists on forcing a war, the American people will immediately give the government the same support. Japanese remarks, such as those made by Tojo, only serve to show the futility of Special Envoy Kurusu's talks with the United States and further strengthen American views. It is generally hoped here that Japan will still see the common sense to change its policy in this final period, as the US government is convinced that if Japan changes its policy, it will benefit from the United States and its Far Eastern comrades. However, if Japan remains stubborn, it will directly invite disaster. This point has been clearly expressed by US official circles, without a doubt.</p>
<p>British Reinforcements in Burma Welcomed by China</p>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 1st – It is understood that Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, after a long talk with US Ambassador Gauss yesterday, expressed great satisfaction with the information provided by Gauss. At the same time, officials are closely studying reports from the south and welcomed the news that British and Indian troops have arrived in Rangoon for reinforcement. Many officials said, "This is indeed good news."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 1st – Diplomatic circles say that any Japanese offensive will likely focus on Thailand, but it is also clear that they will attack the Philippines, Singapore, and Burma. The ABCD nations of the Pacific are confident in their ability to cope with the situation. There are indications here that the United States is preparing to take any necessary steps to deal with Japanese secondary actions. It is believed that the ABCD nations will cooperate. A reliable source also told the UP reporter that five British warships are in the vicinity of the Pacific and are currently en route to Rangoon or Singapore. Well-informed sources say that the United States will not take any steps unless Japan takes action against new military targets. Officials say that now is not the time for war, but they indicate that in order to implement US policy and principles in the Far East, direct action may be taken.</p>

<p>Unconfirmed Reports of Japanese Ships Concentrating Near Borneo</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 1st – A state of emergency has been declared here. The volunteer forces, the Singapore Naval Reserve, and the Malayan Volunteer Air Force have all been mobilized.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 1st – The authorities here today ordered the mobilization of volunteer forces. According to the announcement, the Governor of Malaya, acting on the advice of military authorities, signed a notice this morning to mobilize the volunteer forces of Malaya. This is not an indication of immediate deterioration in the situation but a measure decided some time ago to gradually establish security. The significance of this measure is merely that the situation has not yet cleared up. The volunteer forces are part of the defense of Malaya, and their mobilization can now proceed as usual without causing inconvenience to the public.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 1st – All manpower in Malaya is now under control. The volunteer forces throughout Singapore reported within an hour of the announcement of the mobilization order. Many agencies temporarily closed in the afternoon to reorganize their reduced staff.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 1st – According to an official announcement, Rear Admiral Phillips has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet and will command all British ships and naval agencies of the China Station with the rank of Admiral. His Chief of Staff is Rear Admiral Palliser. Lieutenant General Layton, the former commander-in-chief, will return to England for other duties after handing over command. Phillips previously served as a commissioner in the Navy Department and as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff from 1939. He served throughout the last European war, after which he served as Chief of Staff and Flag Officer of the East Indies Naval Command.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 1st – British Secretary of the Navy Alexander announced today that Britain has increased its warships and sent a large number of fresh troops to Malaya. Alexander also said that while US-Japan talks are taking place in Washington, Britain has greatly strengthened naval defenses in Singapore.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 1st – Information on war preparations is not easily accessible, but it is known that Hong Kong, in light of the seriousness of the situation in the Pacific, has adopted various precautionary plans and is now in a state of war preparedness. A two-day defense exercise in Hong Kong, which was quite rigorous, has now ended. Residents have now had a slight taste of wartime conditions. During the exercise, soldiers were ordered to return to their camps, and the navy was prepared to move out at any time. More than 20,000 civil defense workers participated in the defense exercise.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 1st – This morning's official gazette announced that the government believes that residents of Hong Kong who do not need to serve in the event of war and who can move themselves and their families out of Hong Kong should take advantage of any opportunity to do so now.</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 1st – The Australian War Cabinet has convened an emergency meeting due to the tense situation in the Far East. It is reported that Canberra is extremely concerned about the recent developments. According to officials, everything depends on Japan's intentions. If Japan does not start a war, there will be no war in the Pacific. This government meeting was convened on an emergency basis. Several cabinet members arrived by special plane.</p>
<p>Havas, Manila, 30th – The British Broadcasting Corporation recently broadcast a message stating that a large unit of the Japanese fleet, including 16 cruisers, several aircraft carriers, and escorted by many destroyers, is currently patrolling the sea southeast of the Philippine Islands near the Japanese-mandated islands.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 1st – According to qualified observers, Thailand is not alarmed by the baseless rumors spread by foreigners that Japan has invaded the country. This calm and confident attitude is largely due to Thailand's own preparations to resist aggression and the firm belief that rapid assistance is bound to come. Thailand feels more confident about its future in the face of the increasingly dense war clouds in the Pacific for two reasons: 1. The Thai Prime Minister announced last Thursday that the Japanese Embassy had assured him that Japanese troops in Vietnam were not intended to invade Thailand. 2. A Bangkok official radio commentator said on November 24th that if Thailand is forced to defend itself, it will welcome assistance from all friendly nations.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 1st – Today, Domei News Agency published a diplomatic commentary stating that Thailand's position is like that of Belgium at the beginning of the European war. Thailand and the Soviet Union are the only countries striving to strictly maintain neutrality. However, whether Thailand can avoid the fate of Belgium depends on its implementation of a neutral policy and recognition of Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere. It is noteworthy that the Soviet Union did not participate in the Washington ABCD talks. However, after Litvinov's arrival, US-Soviet relations will become closer, so it is believed that the Soviet Union's neutrality is only a matter of time. This morning's editorial in the "Asahi Shimbun" expressed doubts about whether Thailand can maintain its neutrality for long. Propaganda films, leaflets, and radio broadcasts are enough to shake its heart, coupled with military and political pressure from Britain and the United States. There are clear signs that Thailand is gradually softening. This can be evidenced by Thailand's dispatch of a military representative to Singapore. The "Asahi Shimbun," after warning of the danger of Thailand taking this step, said that Japan has made various preparations to cope with the overall situation.</p>
<p>War Atmosphere Thick, Philippine Islands on High Alert</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 1st – Fear of war in the Philippine Islands has apparently increased. According to reliable sources, the army, navy, and air force are on alert. Many officers have returned to their posts from leave. Personnel at the Corregidor Island batteries in Manila Bay have had their leave canceled pending further orders. Residents seem to be waiting expectantly for Japan's reply to US Secretary of State Hull. President Quezon's remarks on Friday that the Philippines are not prepared for war have caused some unease. According to sources, it is feared that Japan may invade Thailand at any time, to pre-empt any possible British entry into Thailand. A passenger who arrived here from Singapore on a clipper said that a large number of British troops have arrived there directly from England. As rumors have spread that Japan will take action against Thailand in the near future, Singapore is filled with an atmosphere of expectation. There are currently fewer aircraft seen there than in the past, and it is believed that some have been transferred to key locations near the Thai border. Blackouts are now carried out every night at the Cavite and Olongapo naval bases in the Philippines. According to responsible officials, all ships arriving in Manila will have inspectors accompany immigration officials on board to strengthen precautions against the infiltration of fifth column elements.</p>

<p>German Raider Sunk in South Pacific</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 1st – The "New York Daily News" reprinted the opinions of prominent Washington commentators Pearson and Allen, saying that President Roosevelt is greatly troubled by one issue concerning Japan: the rumored voyage of the German 35,000-ton battleship "Tirpitz" across the British blockade line to Japan. US naval observers have not been able to determine the ship's exact location, saying that it may have slipped out during the heavy fog in the North Sea and then headed for the Strait of Magellan (in the extreme south of South America). After President Roosevelt returns to Washington from Warm Springs, he will likely consult with Secretary of State Hull and then convene a meeting of national defense leaders. According to the Washington correspondent of the "New York Sun," it is generally believed that the United States is now preparing a naval blockade of Japan to be implemented if necessary.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st – Officials announced today that an armed German merchant ship has been sunk in the South Pacific. According to a Admiralty communique, a reconnaissance plane from the British ship "Devonshire" spotted a merchant ship at dawn on November 22nd. The ship immediately approached the vessel at full speed and dispatched another plane for detailed reconnaissance. It was reported that a ship was anchored not far away, loaded with oil drums. The general shape of the ship was similar to one of the German armed raiders. The British ship sent a signal, and the ship's reply was unsatisfactory, further confirming the suspicious nature of the vessel, so it opened fire. The enemy ship released a smokescreen to escape, but was hit and caught fire within ten minutes. All crew members abandoned ship and boarded lifeboats. The ship's magazine then exploded. It was suspected that a German submarine was nearby. It has since been confirmed that it was impossible to rescue the crew of the ship in this situation. The British ship and its planes were undamaged, and there were no deaths or injuries.</p>

<p>Reuters, Manila, 1st – The Philippine Communist Party took the opportunity of the Soviet Union's new Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, passing through here en route to his post, to publish an article today stating that Litvinov's short stay here may help establish a good understanding between the future independent Philippines and the Soviet Union. When Litvinov arrived, Lieutenant Colonel Parker, the naval aide to the US High Commissioner to the Philippines, and Major General Valdes, the Philippine Army Chief of Staff, were present to welcome him. Last night, President Quezon hosted a banquet at the Presidential Palace, with guests including General MacArthur, Commander of US Forces in the Far East, Admiral Hart, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, the British Consul-General, the Chinese Consul, and members of the Philippine Cabinet. Litvinov is scheduled to take a clipper to the United States tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e7">If the United States Goes to War with Japan, China Will Also Declare War on Japan, and Will Never Conclude a Separate Peace with Japan Under Any Circumstances, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Jiang Tingfu Issues Statement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Jiang Tingfu issued an official announcement today stating that the Washington negotiations will not result in an outcome that is fundamentally unacceptable to China. Speaking as a government spokesman, Jiang said that he did not believe that war would break out immediately in the Pacific due to the firm attitude of the United States. He said, "I do not believe that Japan is prepared to attack Thailand and does not have sufficient resources to engage in an offensive. In fact, I do not believe that Japan can currently launch a large-scale attack anywhere." Jiang also said that if a US-Japan war breaks out, China will declare war on Japan and will never conclude a separate peace with Japan under any circumstances. He denied that China had informed the United States that Chongqing could not continue to fight if Yunnan were attacked or if Chongqing could no longer obtain assistance from democratic countries. When asked about rumors that Sweden was attempting to mediate peace between China and Japan, Jiang replied, "We have not received such a proposal, and even if we did, we would ignore it." Jiang reiterated that if the Washington negotiations broke down, those under immediate attack would be China, not Siberia or Thailand. When asked if China could take the initiative militarily if the ABCD nations of the Pacific declared war on Japan, Jiang replied that we could take the initiative. When asked if China would attack Japan if it received help from Britain and the United States to drive Japan out of China, Jiang replied that he did not think so. He said that China's goal is to drive the Japanese army out of China, and any actions taken in Japan after the Japanese army is expelled from China are not China's concern. (United Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Jiang Tingfu told reporters this afternoon that war would not break out immediately in the Pacific because it is expected that the United States will adopt a firm stance in the Washington talks, and Japan's situation is particularly unsuitable for any new military adventures. Many observers believe that China is trying to get the United States to go to war with Japan, which is wrong. China has always believed that if the Washington talks fail, Japan will not advance south or attack north but will strengthen its military actions against China. Jiang also said that China is taking this opportunity to reaffirm its firm stance, which is said to have been considered by the United States. Jiang declined to provide detailed explanations about the talks with the Communists, only saying that documents on this matter will be published in Washington at that time. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Yesterday was another day of extreme tension here. All reports of Japanese military action against Thailand, the British military's alert in the Far East, and President Roosevelt's early return to Washington made people look forward to whether the situation in the Far East would change dramatically. However, well-informed observers said that this situation can only be called the highest point of the war of nerves between the United States, Britain, and Japan. News from Tokyo said that the Japanese cabinet had decided to instruct Kurusu and Nomura to continue the talks with the United States to the last moment, which shows that the United States and Britain have won the war of nerves. Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Jiang Tingfu reported on the US-Japan talks at a press conference this afternoon, although he did not mention this point, he said that some newspapers here believed that the Pacific war was about to break out because the United States reiterated its position. We do not share this view. Japan, after four and a half years of war against China, cannot make new adventures. Therefore, even after the United States reiterated its position, we do not think that this kind of war is about to happen. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Jiang Tingfu delivered a speech at a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the afternoon of the 1st, the original words are recorded as follows: Because the US government has had the opportunity to reiterate its fundamental policy on the Pacific issue in the talks between the US and Japan in Washington. This is the latest result of the US-Japan talks, which proves that our repeated expressions of confidence in President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull are based on completely reliable evidence. The news media inevitably exaggerate the course of the US-Japan talks, sometimes saying that a compromise is imminent, and sometimes it seems that a major disaster is about to happen. In fact, the news media exaggerated the US government's initial desire for a compromise, and after the talks ended, Japan may not immediately open fire. After four and a half years of war, Japan has no ability to make new adventures. At this moment, those who are concerned about peace should know that the way to avoid war is not to seek compromise with Japan, but to express a determination to uphold justice to Japan. Japan's recent external propaganda excuses are based on its own economic difficulties. We must know that all countries have their own difficulties, and the way to solve them is definitely not to establish a so-called "Co-Prosperity Sphere", but to seek international economic freedom and cooperation through peaceful means. Japan does not do this, but now uses force to propose its monopolistic economic domain, which proves that the Japanese say economy with their mouths, but their hearts are in medieval hegemony.

<p>Chongqing - Since the Hong Kong government assisted our country in eliminating the black market for foreign exchange and announced measures to restrict the remittance of national currency, all government agencies and institutions wishing to withdraw legal tender deposited in Hong Kong must apply to the Ministry of Finance for transfer to the Foreign Exchange Control Commission for review. Vice Minister Gu Yiqun of the Ministry of Finance went to Hong Kong and, in order to facilitate applications for various agencies with predetermined uses, it was agreed that representatives from the Ministry of Finance's Hong Kong branch of the Joint Treasury, the Stabilization Fund Commission, and three other agencies would establish a subcommittee in Hong Kong to review applications on behalf of the Foreign Exchange Control Commission. Those requiring Hong Kong dollars would purchase them from the Stabilization Fund, and those requiring transfers would be handled by the original deposit banks. Subsequently, government agencies, institutions, and charitable organizations wishing to remit legal tender sealed in Hong Kong can provide the names of the original deposit banks, the amount of legal tender deposited, the original purpose, the amount to be withdrawn, and the purpose, along with supporting documents, and submit them directly to the Hong Kong office of the Ministry of Finance for review by the subcommittee, or submit them to the Foreign Exchange Control Commission for forwarding. In the future, all remittances from the mainland to Hong Kong will be accepted in Hong Kong dollars and handled according to the government's procedures for purchasing foreign exchange. Furthermore, regarding the purchase of foreign exchange, many agencies have not followed the current application procedures. According to the Foreign Exchange Control Commission, the review of foreign exchange is currently handled by two agencies. Applications for purchasing foreign exchange from government agencies and institutions (institutions refer to state-owned public utility institutions, jointly operated government-business industrial and commercial enterprises, and all public utilities) should be submitted to the Foreign Exchange Control Commission for review. The commission has published (Instructions for Government Agencies Purchasing Foreign Exchange) and (Instructions for Institutions Purchasing Foreign Exchange), as well as six application forms for agencies to complete. Applications for purchasing foreign exchange from private industrial and commercial enterprises and individuals should be submitted to the Stabilization Fund Commission for review. The commission has also published (Measures for Licensed or Chartered Banks in Free China to Buy Foreign Exchange) and multiple application forms. The Foreign Exchange Control Commission and the Ministry of Finance have already circulated these instructions and measures to various agencies for reference and have published them in newspapers for public awareness. Applications for purchasing foreign exchange should be handled in accordance with these regulations. (30th dispatch)</p>

<p>During the five days that the U.S.-Japan talks were in a standstill, the news coming from Washington, Tokyo, and London uniformly suggested that the situation in the South Pacific was extremely serious. Ever since Tojo delivered his speech on "sweeping away" Anglo-American interests in East Asia, the world has grown increasingly gloomy. However, yesterday's Washington dispatch reported that Roosevelt had canceled his hot springs vacation and hurriedly returned to the capital. At the same time, the Japanese special envoy met with Secretary of State Hull yesterday to continue the U.S.-Japan talks. The content of the talks is impossible to speculate on at this time, and the Washington dispatch, apart from the above points, revealed nothing else. However, it stated that observers expect the crisis in the East to be decided within 48 hours. Undoubtedly, the U.S.-Japan talks, which had been at a standstill for five days, will enter another tense phase amidst an atmosphere of unpredictable changes and various rumors.</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly commented on the progress of the U.S.-Japan talks. However, as the situation is still developing, it is impossible to make premature interpretations. We can only analyze the actual situation based on Japan's past movements. Today, the special envoy and Hull are continuing their talks. At this crucial moment of war or peace, which is said to be within 48 hours, we would like to offer our views, assess the situation, and try to make a general review: Currently, Japan's situation involves many internal contradictions. It cannot afford to wage war, but it is unwilling to make peace. If Japan is willing to disregard everything and make a final gamble with its national destiny, the strength of the ABCD line-up should not be underestimated. The most unfavorable condition is that Japan must fight on several fronts, falling into a surrounded situation. Looking at the military deployments made by democratic countries in the South Pacific in recent months, they have been constantly strengthening their defenses and have never relaxed. The air and sea defenses of British Malaya have been built into a sharp and strong camp. Take Burma as an example, a large number of British and Indian troops have recently arrived in Rangoon to reinforce its defenses, including various soldiers, and many have served on battlefields elsewhere. The military deployments on the Philippine Islands have also never been neglected by the Americans. In addition to continuously transporting large quantities of weapons to the Philippine Islands to strengthen its defenses, they have also laid naval mines around the territorial waters. Recently, the Philippine army was officially incorporated into the U.S. military in preparation for any eventuality. Thailand has repeatedly declared to the world that it is determined to defend its territorial sovereignty and resist aggression. Hong Kong held defense exercises in these two days, with more than 20,000 civil defense workers participating, and everything is in a state of war. As for China, its nearly five years of protracted war with Japan has given Japan ample experience. Therefore, under this surrounded environment, if Japan must break through the encirclement of the democratic front and fight on several fronts, the odds of success or failure are too uncertain. As for the inability to obtain supplementary shipbuilding materials during the war and the tragic air raids throughout the country, these are things that can be imagined.</p>
<p>It cannot afford to wage war, but it is unwilling to make peace. Japan has been scheming and scheming almost all the time to resolve the China Incident. On the other hand, it dreams of Germany's partial victory, and it cannot resist the Nazis' various inducements. Therefore, it has ambivalent feelings towards the United States' firm position. What we want to point out at present is that the document presented by Hull to Kurusu is a consistent policy of the United States, hoping to completely resolve the entire issue in the Far East through negotiations, and unwilling to have any more piecemeal problems become outstanding issues. The so-called entire issue in the Far East especially focuses on the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China. The United States has also repeatedly stated that the document submitted by Hull is the final step on the American side, and the second step should be taken by the Japanese side. This means that the United States has fully expressed its views on this matter and will not allow any further haggling. Whether the current talks are aimed at Hull's note and are only responding with a "yes" or "no," or whether other new proposals are being put forward, cannot be speculated on at this time. However, it is generally agreed that the United States holds a firm position and will not be changed by false threats or any unrealistic proposals.</p>
<p>As an isolated and helpless Axis ally in the East, Japan, which neither wants war nor peace, is indeed facing an unprecedented and serious period. As Japanese Minister of Finance Kaya stated, if Japan fails in China, the future will be unthinkable. North China will inevitably lose its current form, and Manchuria may not be spared. Currently, if Japan makes a slight mistake, it will revert to its position in 1895, with its hands and feet bound and unable to operate outside the islands. Kaya's views fully and concretely illustrate Japan's internal contradictory psychology and its current predicament. Based on what has been stated above, Japan still seems to have some expectations for the U.S.-Japan talks and does not want to immediately break them off. Its only wish at present is to try to delay these talks as much as possible, but whether it can delay them or to what extent is still uncertain. As for the steps that the United States will take, it will not give any prior warning, but will impose a comprehensive economic blockade on Japan. At the same time, it will step up the implementation of the Lend-Lease policy for China. If it encounters any obstacles, it will not hesitate to resort to force. In conclusion, the U.S.-Japan talks will inevitably end in failure. In the course of the talks, there will be many more serious situations, sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, successively unfolding until the final total failure.</p>
<p>From the beginning, China has maintained the view that the U.S.-Japan talks will not achieve anything. The facts that already exist have proven that the prediction is not false. However, China trusts the United States and trusts the democratic countries. In particular, it believes that only by helping China fight to the end can there be hope of resolving the crisis in the Far East.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Southern Route Red Army Continues to Win Victories, Captures Taganrog German Troops Retreat Towards the Sea of Azov Soviet Paratroopers Pose Serious Threat to Germans <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - Several British newspapers have received dispatches from the Swedish capital claiming that Soviet troops, after capturing Rostov, have now retaken Taganrog. However, Soviet officials have not yet confirmed this. A correspondent from the Daily Telegraph claims that the victorious Soviet 9th and 97th Armies have entered Taganrog, 50 miles west of Rostov. Moscow Radio stated on Sunday night that German troops did not stop in Taganrog, but are still retreating towards Mariupol on the Sea of Azov, approximately 100 miles west of Rostov. German General Kleist himself has fled to Mariupol, and the Soviet vanguard, covered by nine dive bombers, is now engaging enemy troops 20 miles east of the port of Mariupol. A dispatch from the Daily Mail claims that, according to Moscow Radio last night, there are no enemy traces on the main road to Taganrog, which is 30 miles long. German troops fled and did not stop in Taganrog, continuing to retreat towards Mariupol. The claim by Moscow Radio that Soviet troops have occupied Taganrog has not yet been confirmed. Hundreds of Soviet paratroopers are currently landing behind the German retreat line and using explosives to destroy German supply trains. The German losses are extremely heavy. A German spokesman stated today that the Soviet offensive in the Rostov area is supported by giant tanks.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - A Reuters military commentator claims that the main battleground is still on Soviet territory. Soviet General Timoshenko's fierce attacks on German troops in Rostov and along the northern shore of the Sea of Azov have resulted in the most important victory for the Soviet army in this war. The Soviet army recaptured Rostov with a two-pronged attack, launching a counterattack a week ago, and advancing more than 36 miles in three days from the Donets Basin, or launching a southwest attack to threaten a larger force of German troops than Rostov. All the troops in the area are being held back on the coast of Azov, in danger of being pushed back. German General Kleist understood this danger and retreated with his troops to Taganrog, and the headquarters were also moved to Mariupol, 100 miles west of Taganrog. The Soviet plan to invade the Caucasus has been thwarted. This battle proves that the Soviet generals are effective in command and know how to concentrate large forces for a strong attack to achieve significant results. The reason why the Soviet Union did not do this before may be because the reserves were not fully prepared.</p>
<p>TASS, Tula, 1st - A special correspondent for Pravda in Tula claims that on the morning of the 30th, the Red Army launched a fierce counterattack northwest of Tula. The enemy troops, unable to withstand the attack, retreated to the west. At noon, our army captured three villages and crossed the railway occupied by the enemy. This time, the Red Army launched a surprise flank attack in the dark, causing heavy losses to the enemy.</p>
<p>TASS, Central Front, 1st - A special correspondent for Pravda claims that in the past 24 hours, there have been no major changes in the Klin area, 50 kilometers from Moscow. The Red Army continues to hold its ground, and the enemy's advance in the Volokolamsk area has also been thwarted. In the areas of Maloyaroslavets and Mozhaisk, enemy harassment has been repelled. In the Stalinogorsk area, our cavalry launched a counterattack in the past 24 hours, fighting against the enemy's 17th Tank Division and one regiment of enemy infantry, forcing them to retreat to the south and southwest. The enemy suffered heavy losses. In total, on the 30th and 1st, our army destroyed 43 enemy tanks and 122 trucks in the Moscow area, and annihilated approximately 1,500 enemy officers and soldiers. Air battles also occurred near Moscow, resulting in the downing of two enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 1st - A special correspondent for Izvestia, reporting from the Southern Front, claims that after the Red Army captured Rostov, it continued to launch a fierce counterattack. The enemy attempted to counterattack and prevent our advance, but was unsuccessful. The Red Army, commanded by Kalitonov and Lobadin, took advantage of the darkness to cross the T- River, breaking through the enemy's strong defenses and capturing many important points and heights. The enemy troops continued to retreat, and the fighting continued even at night. The Red Army charged with bayonets and hand grenades, and the fighting was extremely fierce. Furthermore, the enemy's 207th Division repeatedly attempted to occupy an important station in the past few days. Our army preemptively launched a fierce attack on the enemy, engaging them in hand-to-hand combat. The enemy was unable to withstand the attack and collapsed. In three days, the enemy suffered 1,250 dead and wounded.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Germany Two Years After the War Began <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The statement regarding Hess's madness was dictated by Hitler himself. He only released this order hours after learning of Hess's flight, indicating that he had already considered it and it was not a momentary mistake. He dictated this statement to Dietrich, the German intelligence director. This favored aide of Hitler gently suggested to him that Germans might wonder why a man who had been insane for a year was still retained as Deputy Führer. Upon hearing this, Hitler slammed his fist on the table, angrily scolding Dietrich and his group for being too disrespectful and insisting that the statement be published as is.</p>
<p>Dietrich, having no choice, handed the statement over to the German News Agency's teletype machine to send it out. Unexpectedly, transmission stopped halfway through. It turned out that someone from the Propaganda Ministry had read it and stopped them. When the Propaganda Ministry official reported this to Goebbels, Goebbels said that it was an order from above and they had to comply.</p>
<p>If the intention of this statement was indeed to damage the party's credibility, it succeeded. The next day, I spent the entire day in stores, parks, taxis, taverns, upscale apartments, and talking to many Germans, asking for their opinions on Hess's flight. They could only speculate on the reasons for Hess's departure, but they were unanimous in criticizing the party for retaining a madman as the third-ranking leader after Hitler and Göring, questioning what kind of organization it was.</p>
<p>The war against the United States was also a major blow to German youth. Although Goebbels vehemently denounced America as just a "culture of cars, radios, jazz music, dime stores, and Jewish financiers," German youth still saw America as a wonderful and mysterious place with skyscrapers, cars, universities, movie stars, and dances. They all believed that these things were much better than what they had in their own country. At home, they were not allowed to dance or listen to jazz music unless they risked their lives to listen to broadcasts from London or Moscow. They were also not allowed to smoke, use cosmetics, or have fun. They had to work at any time, anywhere, and they had to have at least four children, all in order to bring greater glory to the motherland. However, America was only a place they dreamed of pursuing, not a battlefield.</p>
<p>An American in Berlin could still speak English without provoking the Germans. My wife and I often spoke English in public, and only once did it provoke opposition, and the opponent was a drunk.</p>
<p>One Sunday evening, my wife and a Swedish journalist were in line to buy tickets for the last subway train home. A burly, middle-aged man in front of them turned around, fixed them with bloodshot eyes, and said, "Speak German." The Swedish journalist, whose German was as fluent as a German's, explained to him that my wife was American, not British, and she could not yet speak German. The drunk said, "I don't care. He has to speak German. This is Germany, he must speak German." A German standing behind my wife couldn't bear it and questioned the drunk, "She's an American, she can speak English if she wants to." The drunk said, "No." The other person insisted, "Yes." The two of them left the line, and the heated argument escalated into shouting. The crowd also immediately took sides, but almost everyone supported the idea that "Americans can speak English in Berlin." Finally, because the train arrived, and everyone was eager to board, the argument ended.</p>
<p>The German spring this year was mostly as cold as winter. The supply of coal for apartments was scheduled to stop on May 1st, with no replenishment. Unexpectedly, it snowed on May 9th, and again on May 11th. On the 14th, it rained, snowed, and hailed all at once. I heard a German soldier apologizing to a French prisoner, saying that this kind of weather was rare in Germany. By late May, it suddenly became a hot summer, and from then until I left Germany, it was always sunny and hot.</p>
<p>In the Berlin Zoo, children were impatiently waiting for their turn to see Lorent, the walrus, who seemed like the commander-in-chief of the animals.</p>
<p>Every Friday and Saturday, between 8:00 AM and 12:00 PM, the courtyard of the apartment building was filled with the sound of beating carpets, deafening because, according to regulations, carpets could only be beaten to remove dust during this time. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e28">### Germany Reportedly Demands Air Bases in North Africa from Vichy France; Pétain and Darlan to Meet with High-Ranking German Officials in Orléans <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, Day 1: Marshal Pétain and Darlan secretly traveled by special train last night to a German-occupied area to meet with a certain German official. Although the name was not announced, it is thought to be Göring, the German Minister of Aviation. They are expected to return here tonight or tomorrow. The meeting place is likely in the Orléans area. Marshal Pétain previously met with Hitler in Montoire in June last year after the Franco-German armistice. This trip marks his second personal meeting with German officials. The special train he took had locomotives at both ends, and police protected the tracks along the way.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, Day 1: Responsible officials here stated that while the content of today's talks between Pétain and the German official is unknown, it will likely fall within the scope of promoting mutual understanding. However, given the developments in the international situation and the Mediterranean, some observers believe that the issue of Africa will be a key point of discussion.</p>
<p>Reuters News Agency, French Border, Day 1: Although reports from the United States that French-owned North African air bases have been ceded to Germany have not been confirmed, political observers believe that the most urgent objective of German pressure on Vichy is to utilize the Port of Bizerte in French Tunisia. It is expected that the Vichy government will make a decision on this matter within a few days. Germany is currently planning to convene a "New Europe" conference, with representatives from occupied countries also participating. It is said that Germany's invitation for France to participate in this conference is conditional on Vichy accepting German demands regarding North Africa. Germany urgently needs Bizerte, as the port can facilitate the safe transport of its troops to the front lines in Libya. It is also reported that the German demands have sparked fierce debate between Darlan and Bergeret (Minister of Aviation). Bergeret is widely regarded as the leader of the French "wait and see" faction. It is reported that the French occupied zone remains firmly opposed to cooperation with Germany, but anti-British propaganda from Vichy seems to be having a slight effect among the upper and middle classes in the French unoccupied zone. This propaganda is now being systematically extended to personnel in the French fleet and North African indigenous troops.</p>

<p>Hong Kong: According to reliable sources, after all Japanese nationals in Hong Kong were ordered to evacuate to Guangzhou, most of the remaining hundred or so Japanese nationals here will depart for Guangzhou tomorrow morning. According to the Japanese Consul, although only fifteen people have purchased boat tickets, it is expected that more will continue to do so. (Reuters News Agency, Day 1)</p>

<h3 id="e30">English Vessel to Hastily Head South Due to Receipt of Emergency Order; Vessels on Northern Route Cease Journeys to Tianjin; Dutch Vessel Sails Directly to Hong Kong Without Loading Cargo <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>U.S. Consul General in Shanghai Yesterday Re-Advises Women and Children to Evacuate</p>
<p>On the British side, since the British Embassy announced the evacuation of nationals last month, progress has been very active. The special vessel Anhui Hao arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month and is scheduled to depart tomorrow carrying the first batch of over one thousand registered evacuees, totaling over three hundred people, heading to Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places. The majority will disembark in Hong Kong to await vessels transferring them to Australia. It is understood that the British Embassy is still trying to requisition ships to continue transporting nationals away from Shanghai. Currently, the number of British nationals in Shanghai is second only to Jews and White Russians, ranking third, with approximately four thousand people. The proportion of those evacuating is very small. Future efforts will be more effective to accelerate the evacuation.</p>
<p>British Vessels Cease Journeys to Tianjin</p>
<p>As the situation in the Pacific gradually intensifies and the situation in Southeast Asia worsens, the evacuation of British and American nationals in the occupied areas has become more active in recent days. The Taikoo Company's Liangzhou vessel, originally scheduled to load cargo in Shanghai for Tianjin next year, received an emergency order yesterday to cease its journey to Tianjin and will head south this afternoon. The Yuezhou vessel arrived in port from Tianjin yesterday morning. It was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tianjin, as well as to Weihaiwei and Yantai, on Thursday. It is reported that the vessel brought several dozen evacuating British nationals from Yantai. These British nationals did not disembark after arriving in Shanghai but remained on board. It is understood that it has also received orders to cease its northward journey. Once the cargo has been unloaded, it will carry the British nationals south. The Jardine Matheson's Yusheng vessel is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning and will return south tomorrow. The Fusheng vessel is also expected to arrive in port today. Its journey to Tianjin has also been canceled, and it has been decided that it will head south immediately after unloading the cargo.</p>
<p>A Dutch Vessel Hastily Departs</p>
<p>The Dutch merchant Java Company's postal ship, the Tjisaroea, arrived in port on the 27th of last month, loaded with a large amount of sugar from Java, which has now been unloaded. It was originally scheduled to load cargo in Shanghai and return to Surabaya tomorrow. However, the vessel unexpectedly raised anchor and departed Shanghai yesterday afternoon around 4:00 PM, heading directly to Hong Kong without loading cargo. The Taikoo Company's Anhui vessel is also scheduled to carry British nationals south tomorrow.</p>
<p>American Nationals Receive Further Evacuation Advice</p>
<p>The American President Lines recently disclosed that its President liners will no longer sail to Shanghai. The U.S. Consul General in Shanghai reiterated its advice yesterday morning to American nationals in the city, especially women, children, and unnecessary men, to evacuate as quickly as possible. It also stated that since the authorities had allocated the President Madison and President Harrison vessels for the evacuation of American civilians, American nationals who wish to leave the country must now find their own means. According to an employee of the American President Lines here, as far as can be foreseen, there will be no more President liners coming to Shanghai. However, the company can try to arrange for American nationals to take French postal company and Java Company vessels to Manila. The content of the evacuation notice recently issued by the U.S. Consul General to American nationals is as follows: "This Consulate has recently published notices in Shanghai newspapers and requested radio stations to announce the evacuation of American nationals. We wish to reiterate the previously issued evacuation advice (especially applicable to women, children, and men who do not need to remain here) and emphasize that due to urgent needs elsewhere, the shipping situation in the Pacific region is currently very difficult. Even the shipping facilities that were available a month ago cannot be guaranteed to be maintained. Therefore, we urge American nationals to make preparations for leaving the country as soon as possible, to the greatest extent possible."</p>
<p>U.S. Consulates in North China Issue Similar Instructions</p>
<p>In addition to the American nationals in Shanghai who have again been ordered to evacuate, it is reported that the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the U.S. Consulate in Hong Kong have also issued similar instructions, urging American nationals in their respective jurisdictions to evacuate as soon as possible. Currently, there are 900 American nationals residing in the occupied areas and 1,900 in the Shanghai area, including 490 Filipinos. The reiteration of the evacuation order is directed at women, children, and men without important business. In addition, a total of 220 American soldiers stationed in Tianjin and Beijing have packed their bags and are preparing to evacuate by the 15th of this month on the naval transport vessel Henderson, destined for Manila.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Depositors Bear Risks for Deposits in Chase Bank <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>U.S. Side States Measure is Purely Precautionary; British Banks Temporarily Unwilling to Implement</p>
<p>The U.S. merchant Chase Bank in Shanghai notified its clients on the 29th that clients must be responsible for the safety of their deposits from now on and stipulated emergency liquidation procedures, severing connections with the head office. According to inquiries made by reporters yesterday, some clients of U.S. merchant banks have withdrawn their deposits and transferred them to Chinese merchant banks. British merchant banks have indicated that they may follow in the footsteps of U.S. merchant banks, with each depositor being responsible for the safety of their deposits. However, British merchant banks are temporarily unwilling to implement this measure, as they are deeply concerned that it will affect public confidence in banks.</p>
<p>Chase Bank's Emergency Measures</p>
<p>The three emergency liquidation measures stipulated by Chase Bank are as follows: All deposits in the Shanghai branch of Chase Bank can only be paid at the Shanghai branch of the bank. Any legal issues, seizures, confiscations, or damages are the responsibility of the clients, with no connection to the head office. If the Shanghai branch encounters insufficient assets to cover the branch's liabilities, clients can only share in the remaining assets of the branch.</p>
<p>Precautionary Measure Due to Uncertain Situation</p>
<p>It is widely believed that this move by the bank is related to the future situation, hence the preemptive severing of connections with the head office. However, according to an employee of Citibank here, the bank also implemented similar regulations during the "August 13th" Incident two or three years ago. This kind of measure is only a precautionary measure to avoid a situation where any unfriendly authority in Shanghai seizes, confiscates, damages, or obstructs the bank's deposits, and depositors then sue the head office in the United States.</p>
<p>British Merchant Banks Temporarily Not Implementing</p>
<p>HSBC and Mercantile Bank have stated that they have not yet implemented this "disclaimer" measure, but given the U.S. merchant bank's move, they may also follow suit. It is said that this matter is currently under study. However, according to an employee of Mercantile Bank, British merchant banks are "unwilling" to take this step, as it would give the public the impression that the banks believe the Pacific situation is close to a breaking point and are therefore eager to entrust the public with their money bags. He pointed out that this impression would affect the city's commerce and trade. Another employee of a U.S. merchant bank gave a different explanation. He said that the so-called "disclaimer" means that "we are declaring to the public that we will do our best to take care of your deposits, but if an 'unfriendly government' seizes your deposits or takes any action that is detrimental to your deposits, you cannot sue us. Otherwise, please withdraw your money and close your account."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that Mr. Powell and Mr. Kahler, both Western directors of the Council, have resigned due to long-term departures from Shanghai, and their resignations have been approved. Mr. Lock and Mr. Sapple have been appointed to fill the two vacancies on the board. It is noted that Mr. Powell is the general manager of Asiatic Petroleum Company, and Mr. Kahler is the manager of Java Shipping Company. According to Powell, he is scheduled to depart for Australia this afternoon to meet with his wife and will stay in Australia for three or four months before returning to Shanghai. When asked if the Municipal Council would re-appoint him to a position, Powell replied, "I am always willing to serve." Reporters also inquired about Kahler's plans. Kahler replied that he is scheduled to board a ship for Java this afternoon, transiting to the United States, taking his family with him to send his daughter to university, and expects to return here in August or September next year.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and the Japanese side are jointly investigating the increasingly worsening rent situation in the area. However, all parties are extremely cautious about the possibility of taking any action soon and are not readily disclosing anything. According to an official of the French Municipal Council, the bureau is currently studying the matter in theory and does not intend to take extensive steps in the near future, but the bureau intends to assist landlords and tenants in mediating rent disputes. A spokesman for the Municipal Council said that the rent matter has been under study by the authorities of the two concessions and the Japanese side for a long time, but there is unlikely to be any severe action at present. According to general opinion, the authorities are now studying whether they can take any action on the rent matter, rather than what kind of action they can take. A responsible official stated that the rent matter involves legal issues, such as, according to American and British law, the homeowner has complete property rights, so the problem that the concession authorities must deal with is the difficulty of solving high rents.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Take Precautions Against Frozen and Cracked Water Pipes; Company Notifies Users <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>As winter approaches, the English Shanghai Waterworks Company, noting that water pipes, if not protected in advance, are easily frozen and cracked, resulting in water wastage and costly repairs, yesterday notified residents within the concession, stating that, because water pipes and other fixtures freeze, the result is damage to the water pipes, and subsequently, when they thaw, there is a risk of losses to other items due to water leaks. However, the company cannot be held responsible for these losses. The best way to avoid freezing is, when the weather is extremely cold or when freezing is expected, to close the indoor valves tightly and open all the cold water taps to drain the water in the water pipes. Hot water pipes generally do not need to be drained, but users should check the water tanks inside the roofs and other water pipes and do their best to take insulation measures. Water meters installed in exposed locations, as well as the water pipes above and below the water meters, should all be insulated with straw or other materials to prevent freezing. Water wastage due to freezing and cracking, or water wastage for any reason, will be charged according to the meter reading, and water charges must be paid in full. The company is very willing to help users protect water pipes and other fixtures, but only to the extent that the water pipes are not affected. All users should take precautions as early as possible.</p>

<p>Starting the day before yesterday (30th), the Japanese imposed a special curfew in West Shanghai, with armed Japanese soldiers stationed at intersections along the borders of the Chinese and French Concessions, such as Haig Road, Route Tenant de la Tour, and Avenue Joffre, and strictly inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. Japanese aircraft were also flying low for reconnaissance, for unknown reasons. Furthermore, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers suddenly arrived in Qibao Town in West Shanghai the day before yesterday and conducted field exercises at Bridge No. 7 on the Qingpu-Shanghai Road at the eastern end of the town. The sound of machine guns was continuous.</p>

<p>In the early morning of the 19th of last month, an unprecedented fire on Zhubao Road in the French Concession destroyed more than twenty houses, resulting in heavy losses and dozens of deaths and injuries. In addition to the eight bodies that firefighters successively pulled out of the fire scene, more than twenty men and women, including the seriously injured Mao Jiangshi, Liu Shi, the wife of lawyer Wu Juping, Wu Jiangshi, Wu Changying, and Jin Jiabin, were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to reports, five more of the seriously injured have died due to their injuries. Apart from three who have been claimed and coffined by their families, there are also two unclaimed bodies, one an unidentified male (approximately 30 years old) and one a boy (approximately 7 or 8 years old). In addition, there is another seriously injured boy who is currently receiving treatment at Guangci Hospital, and no family members have come forward to claim him. Therefore, it is hoped that the affected families in the area will take note.</p>

<p>Trams and trolleybuses on all routes in the French Concession suddenly increased fares starting yesterday. The increases range from one cent to five cents. The minimum third-class fare has increased from nine cents to one jiao, while the first-class fare has increased from one jiao five fen to one jiao eight fen. The fares for public buses on Route 22 and Route 21 have also increased at the same time, with the minimum fare increasing from one jiao five fen to one jiao eight fen, regardless of the length of the route. For example, the first-class fare from the Great World to Nanyang Bridge is one jiao eight fen after the increase, while the first-class fare from the Great World to Route Lafayette is also one jiao eight fen. At a time when the two concessions are making every effort to suppress prices, the sudden increase in public transportation fares in the French Concession is extremely noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Municipal Council Plans to Purchase Thai Rice for Sale at Fixed Prices Through Rice Shops <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>According to inquiries made with relevant parties yesterday, the authorities plan to purchase a portion of Thai No. 2 rice in the future and distribute it to rice shops through the Municipal Council for sale to the public at fixed prices. The quality of Thai No. 2 rice is better than the current Municipal Council's small-ground rice, so it is expected that people in the city will be happy to eat it. According to a report released by the Municipal Council's two Western rice retail outlets, from the beginning of the operation at the beginning of last month to the end of last month, a total of 6,000 bags of fixed-price rice were sold at the Gongping Road rice outlet in Hongkou and 5,000 bags at the Gordon Road rice outlet in 18 days. Because each person is limited to purchasing one dou (approximately 2 gallons), and the Gordon Road rice outlet is located near a slum, where people usually buy only one or two sheng (approximately 0.2 to 0.4 gallons) of rice at a time, it is estimated that at least 110,000 people benefited.</p>
<p>In other news, the city's second collective purchase of over 20,000 bags of rice, after being distributed by the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the Rice Shop Industry Association, yesterday, 90 rice shops in the city lacking rice began to pick up goods with vouchers at the designated rice shops. Rice shops that have obtained rice must immediately sell it at a price of 130 yuan per dan (160 catties), without reducing the weight and without adulteration. Rice shops that have not registered to sell rice are allowed to continue registering at Shanhai Guan Road.</p>

<p>In view of the high price of rice and the approaching winter, the Mid-Church Charity Association on Route du Consulat has decided to start a relief rice congee kitchen at its Route Remi branch on the 8th of this month to benefit the poor. It is reported that the daily limit will be 2,000 people for the time being. However, poor people who wish to drink congee can apply for registration at the association or the headquarters on Route du Consulat from now on, bringing two one-inch photos with them. The association will issue a congee drinking certificate, which must be presented to drink congee in the future to prevent abuses.</p>

<p>Recently, electrical and plumbing workers in the city, due to insufficient income to make a living, have made demands to the shops to improve their treatment. However, the employers, citing sluggish business due to soaring raw material prices, have not fully accepted the conditions for improving treatment proposed by the workers. Therefore, the two sides have been deadlocked. Unexpectedly, starting yesterday, all the workers of the electrical and plumbing companies in the two concessions suddenly announced a strike. However, most colleagues are still opening the market as usual. It is reported that the conditions are far apart, and mediation is pending.</p>

<h3 id="e45">The Shanghai Municipal Council Organizes a Specialized Department to Strictly Suppress the Private Storage of Dangerous Goods; 46 Cases Resolved in Three Weeks; Sentences of Imprisonment Without Commutation to Fines; Still Hoping for Citizen Cooperation to Report as Much as Possible <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Settlement, in view of the successive major fire tragedies within the Settlement, has determined that the cause is the private storage of easily flammable dangerous goods by general tenants. To prevent such incidents, the Council specifically issued Announcement No. 5589 on the 11th of last month, stipulating regulations for prohibiting the storage of dangerous goods and methods for obtaining licenses, etc. The list of dangerous goods enumerated amounts to more than 50 kinds.</p>
<p>Dispatching Experienced Detectives for Dedicated Investigation</p>
<p>Moreover, several experienced Chinese and foreign detectives have been dispatched from the Narcotics and Gambling Departments of the Police Department to form a separate department specializing in managing and investigating violations of storing flammable and dangerous goods. Since the beginning of its work last month, it has successively cracked 46 cases of privately storing dangerous goods. All of them have been prosecuted in the First Special District Court against the defendants in accordance with Article 37 of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Banned By-laws and punished accordingly. (According to the regulations of this article, (1) a fine of up to 300 yuan may be imposed, or (2) imprisonment of up to three months, (3) imprisonment and fines may be imposed concurrently.) However, the general tenants, blinded by profit, or because they are not familiar with the maximum limit of the Council's prohibition of storing dangerous goods, conceal and fail to apply for licenses, and many citizens mistakenly believe that it is none of their business and do not report the violations. As a result, fires caused by the storage of dangerous goods continue to occur within the Settlement. Recently, such as the major fire at a certain paint shop at No. 3 Wuyu Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, on the 29th of last month, was caused by its private storage of a large amount of paint mixing raw materials "amyl acetate" and "ether". In order to make the citizens of the Settlement understand this prohibition method, the person in charge of the investigation department gave a speech to a Huaguang News Agency reporter yesterday, as follows:</p>
<p>Maximum Limit for Storing Dangerous Goods</p>
<p>It is reported that the maximum limit for storing dangerous goods stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Council is calculated for each single building. The most common ones, such as matches, must not exceed 18 large packages per household (1,200 small boxes per large package), kerosene must not exceed 50 gallons (i.e., ten cans of 5 gallons each), gasoline must not exceed 1 gallon, and alcohol must not exceed 5 gallons (the remaining chemical raw materials used in specialized businesses are too numerous to list). If this limit is exceeded, a license and transportation permit must be obtained from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Fire Department in order to designate the placement in a suitable building or location for licensing, to avoid fires or other accidents. Otherwise, if discovered by the Bureau, it will be strictly prosecuted. Since the court imposed fines on the defendants in the previous 46 cases, it seems insufficient to deter cunning hearts. In the future, the Bureau will request the court to impose appropriate imprisonment on all defendants in this type of case, and will not allow commutation to fines, in order to serve as a warning. However, the Settlement is vast, and the Bureau is deeply worried about being out of reach. Therefore, it sincerely hopes that the general public will cooperate closely with the Bureau, and promptly report to the section of Office No. 5 of the Central Police Station those dangerous goods hoarders who conceal and fail to apply for licenses. Once verified, they will be punished according to the law, and it is necessary to reduce the danger and make the public safe. If there is a report, a search will be conducted.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Case of Huang Jinchi Killing His Wife and Fleeing; Refusing to Divulge the Truth; Vague Confession During Yesterday's Trial <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>On March 14th of last year, a murder of a wife occurred in the kitchen of No. 180 Peide Lane, Xin Zha Road. The principal culprit was Huang Jinchi (26 years old), a native of Shanghai, who murdered his wife (Zhao, also a native of Shanghai), hid the body in a box, and fled. More than one year and eight months later, Huang recently returned to Shanghai from another port and was arrested by Chinese Detectives Feng Baishun and Huang Fusen of the Mixed Court Police Station at the corner of Beishan Road and Tiantong Road at about 2:00 PM on the 29th of last month, and taken to the police station for detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper.</p>
<p>The Process of Killing His Wife</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday, the police station escorted the suspect Huang to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station filed a public prosecution for murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Law. According to the defendant's confession, before the Shanghai war, he served as an instructor in the 8th team of the Pengpu District Defense Corps. After the war, he was unemployed and had financial difficulties. In December of the year before last, he moved to the kitchen of No. 180 Peide Lane, Xin Zha Road, with his wife Zhao. At 5:00 PM on March 14th of last year, he had a quarrel with his wife. He was extremely angry, and took a rope from the stage, put it around his wife's neck to threaten her. His wife said she was not afraid of death, but was unable to resist, and a disaster occurred. In desperation, he dragged her body from the bed and placed it in a clothes box under the bed. After the incident, at about 8:00 PM, he took the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>Fleeing to Other Ports</p>
<p>He took a trolleybus on Da Tong Road to Dongxin Bridge and got off, went to a small inn on Min Ti Ni Yin Road in the French Concession and stayed overnight. At 6:00 AM the next morning, he took a bus on Aidoa Road to Sichuan Road Bridge and got off, took the Ninghu train to Nanjing Xiaguan at the North Railway Station, and stayed at a friend's place and a small inn for more than a month. Later, he went to Guanqian Street in Suzhou. A friend introduced him to a sergeant in the army, which lasted for about five months. Then he returned to Shanghai and lived at a friend's place at No. 44 Zhaojia Garden in Zhabei for a week. He took the Ninghu train to Wuxi, and was introduced by a friend to serve as a policeman. In September, he returned to Shanghai again, living in the Nanshi area, staying in small inns or at friends' places.</p>
<p>Visiting Friends and Being Arrested</p>
<p>On the afternoon of November 29th, he went from Laoximen to Beishan Road in the Public Settlement to visit a friend and was arrested by public officials of the Mixed Court Police Station. Regarding the death of his wife Zhao, it was due to a momentary anger that caused this tragedy. He asked for leniency. The trial judge Zhong Qing asked the defendant for a long time, but his confession was vague and he refused to confess the truth about killing his wife. (According to the defendant's prior preparation of two letters of last resort, one in English, to Mr. Tan of the Tiantian Hotel at the intersection of Guangxi Road, and one to his sister, Ms. Mou, the meaning of the letters was that he had extensively socialized with dance girls, failed in the love market, and had financial difficulties, and could not maintain his livelihood.) The court ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<p>Recently, as the winter season is approaching, theft cases have occurred frequently. Yesterday, a major case of bandits robbing cotton cloth occurred in the Public Settlement, which is truly shocking. It turned out that Yisheng Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 5 Sheng'an Lane, 473 Ningbo Road, west of Fujian Road, because it stored a large amount of cotton cloth, there was no room in the house, so it piled a large batch of cotton cloth in the alley at the door. Fearing that it would be humid due to rain, it covered the piled cotton cloth packages with oilcloth. It has been a long time. Unexpectedly, the matter was detected by the bandits, so they started the idea of robbery. Suddenly, at 6:40 AM yesterday, they gathered eight accomplices and hired three rickshaws. One bandit took a handgun and went to the lane, and moved three large pieces of cotton cloth to the car. The bandits saw that Qin Changgen (38 years old), a Changzhou person who set up a tofu pudding stall at the entrance of the lane, was already setting up a stall to sell, fearing that it would be ruined, so they tied Qin with a rope, scared him from making a sound, and feared that he would be discovered. They covered Qin with the oilcloth used on the cotton cloth packages, and then fled separately. Then, a female scavenger discovered it after passing by. She untied Qin, and Qin knocked on the door of the shop to report the truth. The shop urgently reported to the police station and notified the police posts to intercept. As a result, one car of cotton cloth was intercepted at the entrance of the Da Jiangnan Hotel on Fujian Road. It is reported that the cotton cloth robbed from the shop was worth more than 30,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The case of lawyer Song Yaoji and his client Zhao Binglin recently being sued by lawyers Lei Xiaofu, Yan Wangtang, Qian Zheng, and Zhao Zuwei to the First Special Court's Criminal Court for false accusation and defamation. The prosecution alleges that the plaintiff Lei Xiaofu, on November 3 of this year, was entrusted by his friend Zhang Lianting to take care of the storefront downstairs at No. 9 Guizhou Road, which his elder brother Lei Suwei jointly rented. The original tenant was Jiatai Company. Now that Jiatai Company has moved, she was asked to take care of the house on their behalf, so she went there the next day and saw that Jiatai Company had removed all its business goods and account books. The rent arrears had also been paid to Zhao Binglin. At that time, Zhao had not paid the rent, so he temporarily kept the scales and an empty iron box. Unexpectedly, Zhao and lawyer Song Yaoji went to the Lao Zha Police Station and falsely accused the plaintiff of impersonating police officers and attempting to lock the house. After the plaintiff explained the reason, the police station refused to accept the case because the dispute between the two parties was a civil matter. Unexpectedly, the next day, Zhao suddenly broke the lock with a Japanese person and trespassed into the house. The plaintiff went to the Lao Zha Police Station to report the incident. On the 12th, Song Yaoji, in his capacity as a lawyer, published an advertisement on behalf of Zhao Binglin, which still contained false statements such as Lei Xiaofu leading people to impersonate police officers, publicly insulting the plaintiff's reputation, which is a violation of the criminal law. Please severely punish him according to the law, etc. Yesterday afternoon, this case was heard by Judge Shen, and it was decided to reschedule for further verification.</p>

<h3 id="e59">The 14th West Qing Basketball Tournament Opens; Liangxi Greatly Defeated by Blue White; Shen Yu Gong and Wu Min Lack the Required Procedures <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The 14th West Qing Basketball Tournament opened last night. As a result of the Group B match, Hua Nan defeated the Blue White B team with a score of 41 to 24. Hua Nan also had the advantage in the first half with a score of 10 to 12. Blue White B was originally named Qiang Xing. The main leader, Mr. Qian Xucang, temporarily submitted a request to the West Qing authorities to change the name, which has been approved. Therefore, the name Qiang Xing has become a flash in the pan at the West Qing meeting and will not be seen again in the future. In the second match, the French police and the French army fought, and the French police won with a score of 33 to 18. However, the score in the first half was very close at 13 to 12. In the final match, Liangxi faced Blue White in Group A. Spectators were shocked by the fame of the two teams and came in droves. Unfortunately, the disappointing thing happened suddenly. In addition to the old members, Liangxi temporarily recruited two tiger generals, Shen Yu Gong and Wu Min, former pillars of the Hua Lian team, to help out. However, in the 1930 season, the Hua Lian team staged a full-scale martial arts performance at West Qing. The West Qing authorities added the punishment that the Hua Lian team would never be allowed to participate in the competition again. Last night, the West Qing authorities rejected Shen and Wu's participation in the Liangxi team. After negotiations, it was decided that Liangxi must submit a written guarantee that the same incident would not happen again in West Qing before they could participate. However, Liangxi did not have time to complete the procedures, so Shen and Wu were finally unable to play. In addition, Zhang Liangyou has not yet returned to Shanghai, which greatly reduced their strength. Blue White, on the other hand, had Zhang Shaoqing's help, which increased a lot of offensive power. The situation was the opposite of Liangxi. Therefore, under the large-scale situation of Blue White, it has always created a one-sided situation. The score in the first half was 41 to 13. In the second half, Liangxi's Zhang Jia was sent off and only four people were left to play, which further showed their support. Blue White then won by a large margin with a score of 68 to 27.</p>

<h3 id="e63">The Trend of Gold Buying Rises Again <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash price of bullion in the unofficial market suddenly surged, nearing the 15,000 yuan mark. The on-and-off negotiations between the US and Japan appeared to be fruitless. Moreover, gold dealers frantically bought in large quantities. Gonghe purchased 880 taels, while Hesheng and the securities firm Tianjin Group also amassed significant amounts. Although Shunyuan sold 810 taels, Tianyuan sold 490 taels, and Xiangxing Yongxianghe also released some, public sentiment was still bullish. There were more buyers than sellers, causing the price to rise from 13,200 yuan in the morning to 14,850 yuan before the evening closing, a sharp increase of 1,700 yuan. Some say that the rise in cash prices yesterday was due to a circular from a certain American bank to its depositors, stating that all risks of deposits would be borne by the depositors themselves. Consequently, after withdrawals, there was nowhere to invest, leading to a return to gold purchases. At the same time, foreign banks had very loose credit, and banks like the Mercantile Bank also issued circulars to account holders yesterday, reducing the deposit interest rate to 1%. This was also a contributing factor. Total transactions for the day amounted to 20,140 taels.</p>
<p>Bullion Approaches 15,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Starting at 9:00 AM, each bar (10 taels) opened at 13,200 yuan, 100 yuan higher than the previous Saturday's noon closing. During trading, Heshun, the securities firm Xianghe, Gonghe, and Hesheng aggressively bought, causing the price to quickly rise by 1,300 yuan to 14,500 yuan. Tianyuan, Xiangxing, Yongshun, and Shunyuan sold in response. Heshun also resold, causing the price to fall back by 70 yuan to 13,800 yuan. Dingsheng, Chengji, Yifeng, Gonghe, and Lai successively bought in, creating a fluctuating situation. The price was once raised to 14,200 yuan. Shunyuan, Tianyuan, Xiangxing, and Yong then sold small quantities down to 13,850 yuan. Hesheng and securities firms bought in, raising the price to 14,100 yuan, at which point Xianghe resold. The noon closing was 13,900 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 2:00 PM, still at 13,900 yuan. Gonghe, Xiangxing, Yongdecheng, Xianghe, and Tianyuan competed to aggressively buy, pushing the price up by 500 yuan to 14,400 yuan. After Xianghe resold and Shunyuan, Chengji, and Tianyuan sold, the price was briefly pressured down to 13,950 yuan. However, public sentiment was bullish, and Gonghe, Hesheng, the Tianjin Group securities firm, Chengji, and Lai successively bought in. The price rose sharply before the evening closing, soaring by 900 yuan to 14,850 yuan. The closing price at 4:00 PM was 14,800 yuan, an increase of 1,700 yuan compared to the previous Saturday's noon closing, with a high-low difference of 1,650 yuan. The listed price of bullion at cash shops was 15,000 yuan, with a purchase price about 1,000 yuan lower.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Rises by 140 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at silverware shops like Datongxing and Xintongxing initially rose to 1,480 yuan, then fell back to 1,430 yuan, and finally rose by 70 yuan to 1,520 yuan (purchase price reduced by 150 yuan), an increase of 140 yuan. Sycee silver was still listed at 20 yuan, while the black market price was 17 yuan, also slightly higher.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Black Market Exchange Rates Quiet, Gold Pound Soars by 4,000 Yuan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the official rates of the Central Bank and HSBC. The rates at smaller counters like Yanfeng were also stable. The black market rates for British and American currencies remained quiet. The British exchange rate was 2 pence and 4375 points, but a certain Chinese broker found no buyers. Importers who were not approved for applications still found it difficult to obtain US dollars at 3.75 yuan, and it was possible to settle at 3.625 yuan. The trend was still weak, and no transactions were completed throughout the day. Compared to the previous Saturday, the British rate was flat, while the American rate was tighter by 125 points.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the British and American pounds surge by 40 yuan along with the cash gold price. The British gold note was still slightly higher by 1 yuan. The American gold note once rose to 28.5 yuan and finally settled at 28.3 yuan, an increase of 9 jiao compared to the previous week. Demand for Hong Kong notes was still strong, and the market price rose slightly. Japanese gold notes and military scrip both rose, with the former reaching 2.9 yuan and the latter rising to 3.63 yuan. Korean notes remained largely unchanged, with the evening market still standing at the original price of 2.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Spinning Around at 2,400 Yuan - The Yarn Market Initially Weak, Then Strong, but the Trend Slightly Calmer. This is mainly due to the rebound in gold prices, which strengthened the resolve of bulls. Consequently, major players returned to buy in, making the market tighter. However, bears remained hesitant due to sluggish trading in actual yarn, although some believed the market could improve if it hovered around 2,400 yuan. The high price for Double Horse 20s yarn was 2,515 yuan, and the low price was 2,360 yuan.</p>
<p>The Double Horse market opened in the morning amid reports of strained US-Japan relations, leading to a highly charged atmosphere. The first trade was down 40 yuan to 2,400 yuan. However, sellers were very active at this time, making the situation appear weak. Shortly after, it fell to 2,360 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange opened higher, and Japan softened its stance. Simultaneously, gold prices surged, and public sentiment turned positive. Furthermore, a certain group bought in large quantities, turning the market from weak to strong, rising to 2,460 yuan. Due to profit-taking, it then eased to 2,410 yuan. The closing price was 2,420 yuan. A check of the transaction statistics for the morning half-day showed 2,950 bales traded. The opening price in the afternoon was average, at 2,420 yuan. Later, it was heard that the exchange's yarn and cloth prices had risen across the board, and buying interest suddenly intensified, rising directly to 2,470 yuan. It then eased again to 2,420 yuan. But by the close, public sentiment suddenly turned bullish, and buyers rushed in, rising straight to 2,515 yuan. The outside market price was 2,515 to 2,505 yuan.</p>
<p>The Jin Double Horse futures market situation, from weak to up, the footing on the ground seems more stable. In the morning, the initial opening was first driven down by reports of international situation worsening, factories first decreased orders, hearts were uneasy, most traded futures. December opened with 2,400 yuan almost the lowest traded, and January after opening with 2,520 yuan, briefly fell to 2,480 yuan. Future deliveries traded higher, later major players watched and waited, although the spot turned firm, it was not able to generate high multi-party interest, only retail traders sequentially traded higher, it still was not very firm, therefore noon closing was somewhat mixed. In the afternoon, the reaction was intense, a sudden rise, first news of a dull mood, the monthly futures early trading remained sideways, waiting for February delivery to open, rumors that the international community has easing trend again, suddenly many floating short positions, the trading floor suddenly becomes tight, near and far deliveries are rising, especially recently environment changes are not settled, public hearts completely flow with the waves, so the future is still difficult to determine. The full day up and down, resulting in December increasing by 30 yuan, January also rose 75 yuan, and February rose 95 yuan the most, listed in the table below:</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains dull and listless, but the gold rebounded, the yarn market restored, public hearts have slightly improved as well.</p>

<p>Factory cloth prices opened flat yesterday morning, turning firm in the afternoon. This was due to the exchange's sharp rise, and public sentiment turning bullish. However, due to environmental factors, there was heavy resistance, and the upward momentum was weak. White cloth (both coarse and fine) rose by 5 jiao to 1.5 yuan per bolt in the afternoon. Bleached and dyed cloth rose by 1 to 2 yuan for some parts. Velvet, on the other hand, became weak and fell. Spot sales remained sluggish, with only a hundred or so transactions on the street. Sales to outside customers remained stagnant as before.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth Due to favorable news about the current situation, the turnaround was fierce. The exchange's colored ball futures cloth continuously rose wildly in the morning and afternoon, by 4 yuan and 4 jiao per bolt.

<p>The unofficial market for public bonds was quite soft yesterday, and the downward trend did not stop. Sellers gradually became more active, with most being bulls exiting their positions. However, the US-Japan negotiations had not been shut down, and the Japanese side seemed to have softened. In the initial morning trading, C-bonds were bought by Hongda, opening at 68 yuan and 1 jiao, and gradually rising to 8 yuan and 5 jiao, slightly better than before. However, Hengkang, Xiexing, and Yuan were strong sellers. Although Runde also had an appetite for buying, they were still outpaced by demand, so the noon closing eased to around 8 yuan. In the afternoon, Yuxing, Dazhong, and Renchang sold even more. Although Jiufeng, Runde, Xiexing, and Yuan also bought back, the downward trend was already apparent, breaking the 8-yuan mark. The price briefly fell to a small price of 7 yuan, closing at 7 yuan and 1 jiao. As a result, the market price for all four types of bonds, except for D-bonds which did not trade, fell by 6-7 jiao to 1 yuan and 3 jiao. The total number of transactions was approximately 2.45 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>

<p>Due to frequent negative news, the public stock market was in a dire and turbulent situation all day. The opening price was much lower than the closing price on Friday. After the opening, selling pressure remained strong, and it fell sharply again after a slight rebound. Although there was some rebound at the closing, the underlying trend was still unstable.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market remained stagnant, while the arrival and sales of domestic rice both increased, and the market shape gradually became lively. About 400 bags of both North and South glutinous and japonica rice have newly arrived in the past two days. However, those holding the goods are concerned that domestic rice will also be restricted in addition to foreign rice and are therefore willing to sell at market prices, so although the digestion of glutinous and japonica rice has gradually increased, the market price remains flat. The opening prices yesterday were 184 yuan for North Gang white broken rice, 182-183 yuan for new japonica rice, and 180-176 yuan for medium-grade japonica rice. The opening prices for South Gang early rice was 174 yuan, thin rice was 175 yuan, and medium-grade rice was 172-170 yuan, totaling about 189 bags.

Small-package native bran was priced at 58 yuan, and Orchid brand customer bran was priced at 55 yuan and a half. Those holding the goods were still reluctant to sell everything. Wheat was also in demand due to scarce arrivals. The import price from Japanese factories was still 72-73 yuan, but there was still a lack of whole tickets being distributed.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was rumored that the Dutch ship Chizali would not unload its cargo and would immediately sail to Singapore for consolidation. Sugar merchants took this opportunity, and the long-sluggish sugar prices immediately perked up, rising by over ten yuan. However, according to reliable sources, although the Chizali set sail early at 4:00 PM yesterday, the sugar and most of the miscellaneous goods had already been unloaded ashore. The rumour that it was unable to unload was therefore a misunderstanding. The company's futures for the current month for 24 coarse white sugar opened at 213 yuan in the morning of the 10th, then eased to 206 yuan, and tightened slightly to 208 to 207.5 yuan in the afternoon.

<p>The source of longan is once again obstructed. Because the transportation between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu is possible with sailing ships, there are sporadic arrivals. Now, according to news from the firm, for some reason, transportation has been stopped again, so other miscellaneous goods are also difficult to transport as usual. At the same time, customers have also telegraphed intending to take the opportunity to raise prices, but since sales in Shanghai have not been strong recently, prices have not risen again and there is a soft trend.</p>
<p>On the 1st, 350 packages of jujubes, 280 packages of walnuts, and 450 packages of chestnuts were imported, all shipped from Tianjin.</p>

Affected by the rebound in lump coal prices in recent days, factory demand has been sluggish, and consumers are watching and waiting. Transactions are sparse, and the market has plummeted. It was recently reported that a foreign firm shipped out a large quantity of Shandong coal dust, a very large number, causing public sentiment to become more and more listless, and the market straight down.

<h3 id="e73">Centenary Celebration of Punch, the Premier British Humorous Magazine <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhong'e</p>
<p>Punch magazine has reached its centenary celebration this year. This is an old-brand humorous magazine that is still being published. Punch has never missed a week since its publication on July 17, 1841. During the last European War, the magazine continued to be published. In this war, only a few countries in Europe were able to laugh freely, and Britain was one of them. Amidst the rubble and ruins of Bouverie Street, the exquisite architecture of Punch magazine remains intact, though the ground floor is entirely barricaded by sandbags. Although Britain is currently spending its days in blood, sweat, and tears, compounded by a shortage of paper, this has not hindered the hunchbacked old man representing Punch from emitting a weekly "Khee-hee-ha-ha."</p>
<p>To reach Punch's editorial office now, one must carefully choose a path on the shrapnel-strewn road, so one has to go on foot. Because a section of Bouverie Street has red flags planted at both ends, prohibiting vehicles from passing. After squeezing past the sandbag barricade at Punch's front door, you arrive at a spacious room, like an old-fashioned country manor—soft carpets on the floor, oil paintings decorating the walls, and a grand circular staircase. Outside the window, sandbags are piled high, making the room very dark, with the electric lights flickering dimly, like Victorian-era gas lamps. The elevator is out of service, and the telephone rings are silent.</p>
<p>Upstairs, the editorial department has been reduced to just two people—the editor, Mr. Knox, and an assistant editor. Another editor has joined the ranks but continues to write for Punch. External manuscripts describing the lives of the army, navy, and air force are increasing daily. However, the famous cover image of the hunchbacked old man and his companion, Toby the dog, sitting in the dwarf garden, has remained the same since it was first published in 1841.</p>
<p>However, it is true that Punch has shrunk slightly in size. The text portion has been reduced from twenty-eight pages per issue to twenty-four pages, and may be reduced further in the future. Before the war, the circulation was 125,000 copies, but now, due to the shortage of paper, it is only 100,000 copies. Since the start of the war, the magazine has been dedicating a full-page to raising funds for the welfare of the army, navy, and air force each week.</p>
<p>In terms of the quality of the writing, Punch has shaken off its conservative style, as if it were wearing tinted glasses, years ago. While the magazine's artists used to portray the lower classes as villains, Punch has progressed towards the crossroads in recent years. A newer artist has chosen subjects from high society, drawing them not as they were usually accustomed to, but with a pair of crooked eyes as a characteristic.</p>
<p>Blood and sweat are accelerating the pace of progress. The old days of diverse positions and interests are gone. Today, men and women, young and old, from all walks of life are doing the same things. Punch has become a younger, more accessible magazine, remarkably able to celebrate its comedic centenary in the rubble of Bouverie Street, in a home surrounded by sandbags. Punch is now more politically inclined than before, although its commentary in this area, like in other areas, is only a description of a wisp of smoke rising from the modern scene. One of the magazine's famous writers, Mr. Herbert, now a right-wing figure in the country, often uses Punch as a political platform, but his conservatism no longer represents the views of Punch's editorial staff. Punch is still suitable for the tastes of all classes, but this taste is no longer at odds with a sense of righteous indignation.</p>
<p>There is one particular aspect worth emphasizing when celebrating its centenary. When Punch was born, Queen Victoria was still in her youth, and the French across the English Channel wore top hats and enjoyed eating frogs.</p>
<p>If you flip through the old issues of Punch today, you can see the lively and vivid story of England over the past hundred years, expressed through countless drawings, essays, and poems, even better than any serious history books. You can see the high-backed chairs in old-fashioned coffee shops, the tall pumps in old-fashioned bathhouses, and the top hats worn by players on the London cricket grounds. You can see women wearing steel-hooped skirts and men with long whiskers in the 1850s, the first cigarettes, the first ice skates, the first small bicycles, the first tennis and telephones. You can learn about the expansion of crinolines into tight-fitting skirts, and the lifeless obsession with water lilies by aesthetes in the 1880s. You can learn about women's fondness for endless exercise in the 1880s, which developed into demonstrations for women's suffrage in the 19th century. The card game "bridge," golf, and automobiles began to become popular. Water pipes, taxis, and buses shook London. Toys such as ping pong and tops were popular, helping people pass the time. Then came the First World War.</p>
<p>Speaking of Punch, one question must arise: "But is this book funny?" The immediate answer is that it is useless to compare it to the New Yorker magazine in the United States. The two magazines are completely different in nature. It can also be said that English humor is the growth of rich and excellent variations. The Elizabethan literary style is influenced by the love of music halls and smoking rooms, but for Punch, both are forbidden. What the hunchbacked old man gives people is a quiet, excellent humorous magazine, which never describes trivial things. To gain a proper understanding of Punch, perhaps one should think of the magazine's fiftieth anniversary celebration in 1891, a solemn religious celebration in which there was no singing of hymns or other rituals. The person praying had these words at the end of the prayer: "It is very easy to drift from humor to evil, but it is very difficult to enter into wisdom through humor."</p>

<p>— Yu Zhen</p>
<p>On September 6th of this year, King Peter II of Yugoslavia celebrated his eighteenth birthday. Members of the British royal family, government leaders, diplomats, and military officers gathered at St. Paul's Cathedral to celebrate his birthday. At the same time, officials held a reception in his honor. Peter, wearing the uniform of an Air Force Colonel and exuding heroism, announced on the spot that he had vowed not to dance until his country regained its freedom.</p>
<p>This young and handsome monarch went into exile in London after the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia last April. He loves dancing, especially American dance music. When he was studying at the Army University in his home country, he learned various new dances. His skills were mature, and he was widely praised in social circles. Now, he can resolutely stop dancing, study hard, and wait for the restoration of his homeland. He is truly a rare and enlightened monarch, greatly superior to those "isolated island men and women" in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Peter II's favorite subject to study is said to be aviation, but after entering Cambridge University this fall, he will probably have to put it aside temporarily.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Coal Poisoning <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Again</p>
<p>Coal poisoning is carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is an extremely poisonous gas. If the air contains one part in 100,000, it can poison people. If its composition reaches one part in 800 or more, it can be fatal within half an hour. So, it is easy for people to die from coal poisoning. Even if they know they have been poisoned, they cannot call for help or escape, because the hemoglobin in the blood cells has combined with carbon monoxide to form a stable red substance, rendering the blood cells ineffective. Therefore, a person who has been poisoned by coal is in a semi-conscious state, so almost all functions stop working. Therefore, people who have been poisoned by coal often struggle to the side of the bed or the ground and die.</p>
<p>Every winter, people close their windows and doors for fear of the cold and put coal stoves in their rooms for warmth, and people die as a result every year. This is because the public lacks common sense.</p>
<p>We need to know that smoking also involves inhaling coal poison, so you see that the "old guns" have no color in their faces, as straight as white paper, because when they smoke, they inhale half the cigarette in one breath, so the tobacco leaves and other things do not burn completely and turn into a gas of carbon monoxide that is inhaled, although it will not be fatal immediately, but it is also one of the reasons why "old guns" die early.</p>
<p>Winter is coming, I hope that this year, fewer people will suffer from coal poisoning!</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Fifteen, Dad, let's go busking!"</p>
<p>Of course, he wasn't wrong, but Meibao's cleverness wasn't just being able to determine from these few words that Qiu Haitang's words about sweeping the old stage were fake, but that he was actually filling in for the martial arts roles. Moreover, she also understood why her father was deceiving her in this way. The main reason, of course, was for their livelihood; so, after Zhang Yincai left, she didn't expose Qiu Haitang, just pretending she hadn't heard anything.</p>
<p>But from this day on, Meibao's inner distress became even deeper. On the one hand, she had to wholeheartedly serve her father, hoping for his early recovery. On the other hand, she had to make various arrangements without revealing her true intentions, to find a way to solve their future livelihood in advance, to prevent her father from going back to the Red Stage to play a heroic role after he recovered from his illness.</p>
<p>Qian Ruomo had come once, and Meibao had earnestly asked him when she was sending him out, hoping that he could come up with a good plan to solve a big problem for her and her father.</p>
<p>"Judging from your father's recent physique, it's impossible for him to make a living as an actor!" Qian Ruomo first moved the half-smoked cigar to the left corner of his mouth in a practiced manner, then turned back and said to Meibao very calmly, "You are so young and have considerable knowledge. In normal times, it would be easy to find a position. But now, as you know, our army has retreated, and the situation in the concession is very chaotic. Even newspapers have news of closures, so how can I recklessly introduce you?" (277)</p>

<h3 id="e77">英子, Shi Yuan, and Other "Feng Wa" Re-enact a Prelude <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Feng</p>
<p>There is a type of actor who excels in a style that is either tragic, joyful, lively, or serious, falling into typecasting. At the same time, there is a type of actor who is proficient in multiple styles, becoming multifaceted. We cannot examine who is right and who is wrong from this. Whether an actor is typecast or multifaceted, as long as they understand the character's personality in the play, can perform openly and freely, then they will inevitably approach the path to success.</p>
<p>Let's talk about Yingzi. In "Home," she played the role of Ming Feng. Everyone noticed her control over a deeply suppressed, melancholic emotion, coupled with her appearance as a lonely and weak woman. Undoubtedly, she successfully portrayed Ming Feng. However, in "Border Town Story," "Feng Wa" is a lively, clever, and affectionate little girl. She performed in a completely opposite style, and she played it so naturally and adorably, without a trace of Ming Feng's aura. This proves that she is an actor with multifaceted acting skills, capable of both performing and letting go, without revealing any forced effort.</p>
<p>Then there's Shi Yuan. He vividly portrayed Old Gou in "Border Town Story." His Shandong-accented speech further emphasized this honest and loyal character. However, precisely because of this, the image of Old Gou still manifested unconsciously in "Metamorphosis," and "Ah Q" in "The True Story of Ah Q." Here, he can certainly reprise his most skilled role of Old Gou, but it is hoped that after falling into typecasting, he will simply work hard on this type of play. In addition, he can choose roles to avoid miscasting.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Professional Theater Troupe is re-enacting "Border Town Story," renamed "Feng Wa." It seems that they have some feelings and have written about these two people as problematic figures. I think most readers who love drama will also have some sympathy?</p>

<p>The playwright Gao Jilin (i.e., Ke Ling)'s recent script "Turbulent Times" has been adopted by Jin Xing and will be directed by Shu Shi, following "Romance of the Flowers in the Mirror."</p>
<p>It is rumored that a certain giant merchant in this city recently invested 200,000 yuan to produce a Yue opera film led by Yue opera queen Yao Shuijuan's Yuehua Troupe. It is currently in active progress; whether this is true remains to be verified.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's "Female Knight Robin Hood," produced by Da Guan during her trip to Hong Kong, has been brought back to Shanghai by Chen upon her return on a ship, carrying a copy. It will be screened at the Huguang Theater in this city soon.</p>
<p>"Peach Blossom Robbery," starring Jin Yan and Zi Lan, is Wu Yonggang's first work after arriving in Hong Kong. It has recently been shipped to Shanghai and will be released publicly by the China Film Union.</p>
<p>Hua Nian Company's maiden work, "Hong Xuanjiao," stars Tang Ruoqing and the entire China Travel Troupe, directed by Fei Mu. It has now been completely edited and will premiere at the Xinguang Grand Theater in this city. According to reports, this film can be considered the last hurrah in period costume films.</p>
<p>The slapstick film "Shanghai Gold Rush," starring Han Langen and Yin Xiucen, began filming last week. The female leads are Zhang Wan and Yuan Zhuru, who is in mourning.</p>
<p>Xu Xinfu has been appointed director of the Second Studio of the China Film Union. His self-established Fuhua Company officially closed last month.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk: The Nomad Cavalry Fill the City with Dust</p>
<p>I had no heart to drink and left the table before the end of the feast, excusing myself to return. I wonder if my virtuous brother has had any supper?” Liu Yingying said, “Although I feel a little tired, my appetite is still good, so I had my supper as usual.” Xu Jing said, “Does the arrow wound on your leg still hurt?” As he said this, he suddenly jumped up and said, “Oh dear! I was so busy that I just took the medicine and put it in that light table drawer, but I haven’t told you yet. I was just talking to everyone and didn’t apply it for you. I deserve to die!” Liu Yingying smiled slightly and said, “Many people came just now, and you had to go to see General Wu. It’s no wonder. I didn’t see you put it in the drawer, so I didn’t take it to apply.” Xu Jing said, “Please forgive me, virtuous brother. Let me apply it for you.” He went outside, got a bowl of clean hot water from a soldier, and put it on the table. After the water had cooled slightly, he took out the packet of wound medicine from the drawer. When he opened it, it was a fine yellow powder. He also took some clean cotton, held the bowl of water, walked to Liu Yingying's bedside, and said, “Virtuous brother, loosen the bandage on your leg wound, and let me wash it for you, then apply the good medicine.” Liu Yingying sat up in a rush and said to Xu Jing, “Ah! How can I let brother Jing attend to such a dirty matter? Let me do it myself.” Xu Jing said, “Don’t move. There’s no need to be so polite between us brothers. It’s inconvenient for you to wash it yourself, so let me wash and apply it for you.” He then lifted the thin cotton quilt covering Liu Yingying. Liu Yingying said, “Wait a moment,” but the thin cotton quilt had already been lifted halfway. Liu Yingying hurriedly covered himself. Lifting his right leg, he was wearing single trousers? The wound was bandaged with cloth. (233)</p>
