<h3>中緬邊界問題之解決</h3>
<p>據隔昨重慶消息：關於滇緬路南段的中緬劃界換文，業於十八日下午經中英雙方在陪都舉行，詳細規定，滇省與緬甸邊境的界綫。這一經歷了五十幾年的歷史懸案，經過無數周折，至今始在中英友誼空前良好的氣氛之下獲得合理的解決，除却值得慶幸而外，在中英雙方，也都該算是在作戰中一件極有價值的外交成就。現在姑從已往歷史做一回溯。</p>
<p>滇緬邊界一帶之與中國發生關係，開始在漢武帝的通西南夷，其正式隸屬中國版圖則肇始於蒙古帝國的忽必烈時代，在那一帶建國的金齒緬國葡甘八百媳婦等邦不是為蒙軍所征服便是相率奉使朝貢，歷經明淸兩代，雲南割為行省，緬甸亦朝貢不絕。在有淸乾隆前所訂中緬舊界，且跨有金沙江內外，孟養孟拱孟密諸十司都在中國境內，其後改劃新界，但因緬甸是中國藩屬，有許多未定之界並未嚴格厘定。到一八八六年，英國併有緬甸，於是邊界交涉乃開始形成了問題。當時淸廷令總理外交大臣慶淸王奕劻與英公使歐格訥磋商中緬關係，曾成立條的五項，其第三條即為：「中緬邊界，由中英兩國會同勘定」。但是實際上，淸廷稽遲拖延，直到一八九四年始派英使薛福成與英交涉界務，厘訂劃界通商條的二十條，議定自北緯廿五度三十五分的尖高山起至北緯二十一度二十七分的湄公河岸為已定邊界，但其中自北緯二十三度三十分以南之南丁河南棒河合流處至猛馬附近之南馬河與南長江合流處則僅決定界綫原則，其具體劃界須與北緯二十五皮三十五分以北直到貢山設治局一段的未定界同樣，尚有待於實地的勘查，此亦即所謂南段未定界與北段未定界之別，北段包括江心坡與片馬，南段則包括班洪，這些都是世人耳熟能詳的糾紛區域。但到一八九九年實際勘查時，雙方所根據的圖本旣有歧異（即所謂黃綫與紅綫之別，其後又有所謂綠綫藍綫等，都是關於界綫的一種擬議），復因英方誤指孔明山為界的中所規定的公明山，以致雙方見解懸殊，未能獲得定案，擱置至今，已經是四十年有餘了。</p>
<p>在那四十年中，因為邊界不定，雙方不時發生糾葛，在江心坡片馬一帶自一九一〇年以來曾幾經紛擾，民國二十二年，雙力又因班洪附近的鑛產引起重大糾紛。雙方鑒於邊界長此甌脫，實無法杜絕種種爭執，乃由中英雙方磋商，設立共同勘查委員會重勘舊界，由中英各派委員二人，另由國聯行政院派中立委員一人組織之，於廿四年四月十七日公布換文。該會成立後，前後兩屆，前往中緬邊界實地勘察，幾度折衝，始於廿六年四月製成報告；但因不久中日戰事爆發，遂不遑根據勘查結果原定邊界。這一懸案直到隔昨纔獲得最後的解決，已往雙方爭持焦點的班洪猛董等地確定劃歸華方，而對於班洪附近的爐房鑛區問題則決定由中英雙方共同投資開採。</p>
<p>這一歷史糾紛的解決自然是中國為提高國際地位而奮鬥過程中的一個重要的紀程碑，同時又應該看做日前英美當局準備在戰後取消對華不平等條的的言的發軔。這固然應該歸功於中英雙方外交當局的努力與賢明，另一方面，也未嘗不是因為中國奮力抗建而獲得了並世列强重視的結果。只要繼續奮力不懈，預料此後中國在外交上的收穫，必將更有什百倍於滇緬邊界的解決者。</p>
<p>滇緬的未定邊界，原有南北兩段，但是二十四年組織委員會從事勘察者却僅限於南段，此次的劃界換文，渝電雖未明顯指出經緯和四至，細繹文義，大概也僅以南段為限，而北段則仍為待決問題。為了邊境的安癘與中英中緬良好友誼的保待，南段界綫旣定，北段亦不宜聽之久懸，雖然為了中緬交通建設問題也許南段比較北段更形切要。本着同樣的精神與立塲，相信滇緬邊境北段的劃界，也不難與南界獲得同樣公允合理的解決。</p>

<h3>近東情勢一變　德土簽友好條約　保證互相尊重領土完整　十年以內繼續發生效力</h3>
<p>海通社十九日柏林電　此間官方官稱、德、土友好條的、已於十八日晚間、由德國駐土大使巴本代表德政府、土耳其外交部長薩拉柯格魯代表土政府、加以簽訂、全文如下、</p>
<p>德國及土國、由於置兩國關係于互相信任與誠摯友好之基礎之願望、已於保持兩國目前各項的束之條件下、商定簽訂本條的、德元首已任命駐土大使巴本為全權代表、土國總統已仟命外交部長薩拉柯格魯為全權代表、商定下列各條款、</p>
<p>第一條　德、土兩國保證互相尊重領土完整與不可侵犯性、亦不採取直接或間接針對他方之任何措置、</p>
<p>第二條　德、土兩國·保證將來對於涉及共同利益之各項問題、進行友好之商議、藉以覓致關於處理此項問題之諒解、</p>
<p>第三條　本條的將加以批准並立即在柏林交換批准文件、本條的於簽字之日起、發生效力、並於十年內繼續發生效力、締約國將於規定時期內、成立關於本條的延長時效問題之諒解、本條的以德、土兩國文字繕寫兩份、於一九四一年六月十八日簽字於土京安加拉、</p>

<p>路透社十九日柏林電　德官方通訊社　、德駐土大使與土外長昨夜九時在土　簽訂土德友好條約、未幾土京無綫電台正式宜布土德已簽訂互不侵犯條的、並已交換相同之牒文、十一時該電台突停止正常播音節目、而宣布土、德條的之內容、及土外長向報界發表之言論、外長調、「兩國實際的與現有的義務、並不受影響、土、德茲已證實兩國將來不以仟何方法互相反對、數百年來世事迭變、土、德兩國則從未互相反對、其關係向稱明白而正確、今簽此的、實已奠定極堅固的友誼之基礎」云、土外長宣布此的簽訂時、表示「大為歡忭」、謂「友人巴本、熟知我國情勢、會作特別努力、使此協定得告簽訂」、</p>
<p>海通社十九日安加拉電　此間政界認德、土友誼公的、為兩國經濟關係恢復及希特、與夫希特勒與土總統屢决互換照會之自然結果、政界對此公的甚覺滿意、認係賡續世界大戰時兩國之傳統友誼、但此項友誼公的、並不影響土國與其他國所定之條的、至於德國方面、能獲得土國之友誼、實為一外交上之重大勝利、此事亦可表示土國政治家眼光之遠大、土京之英人對於事態之發展、頗感失望云、</p>
<p>路透社十九日安加拉電　據本日消息、土、德親善協定、苟不包括保障英、土條的之條款、則已拒絕簽訂、土耳其因効忠於對英之條的義務、致德國駐土大使巴本所進行之談判、為之延擱多時、土外長唯有俟保障條款承認之後、始肯簽名其上、</p>
<p>路透社十九日倫敦電　據此間今日所接消息、斯丹埠及沿海各區之戒嚴令、將繼續存在六個月、另一消息謂、德·土已簽訂協定、保·土問在希境之一段鐵路、將由土方管理、</p>
<p>德外部評論</p>
<p>海通社十九日柏林電　關於德·土友好公的之簽訂、德外部發言人昨夜稱、德·士士之友誼、應追溯至世界大戰之時、其友誼之深切、非能受臨時之誤會所影響、新土國國父凱末爾、贊成兩國之經濟合作、故當其當國之時、德國對土之輸出及輸入均居首席、德國所購之土國原料及農產物、均佔極大之百份率、現任總統伊斯美賡續其前任之精神、訂立此項公的、使兩國之友誼益臻鞏固、德國認土國為東南及近東之安定勢力、而土國亦深信德國在土耳其及近東無領土野心、五月五日希特勒之演說、則盛稱土國所採取之和平政策、反對英國之陰謀、自其當國以後、則努力鞏固與土國之關係、六月十日義首相之演說、亦表示義國願以一九二八年土·義協定為基礎、與土繼續合作、德國決不忘記土國之舊友誼、土國危急之時、德國決予援助云、</p>
<p>海通社十九日柏林電　德國半官方出版物、僅遇政治重大事件、始偶一發表言論之德國外交政治通訊報、今日評論德·土友好公的、先檢討過去兩國之密切關係、及自國社黨當政以後、德國即為土國之最大顧客、後述及最近事態之發展稱、土國於戰事發生前、會與英國訂立協定、此項協定對德·土關係自然有相當影響、但自德國軍事日佔優勢之後、此項影饗即日歸消滅、於是安加拉當局明瞭德國國力之無敵、及土國採取現實政策之必要、迨德國被迫干涉英國在巴爾幹擴充戰爭之策略後、土國亦深明德國之苦衷、故英外相艾登及英軍事將領屢决訪問土國之時、土國所表示之態度亦極為得體、德軍在希臘勝利之迅速、亦為土國軍人所共見、在政治方面、土國發現德國從前之諾言、均已實現、於是奠定土國將來之政策、此項友好公的、即該項政策之外表、該的所規定之情報關係、德國允為滿意云、</p>

<h3>土耳其仍保持　對英友誼精神　倫敦外使認德土簽約　係對蘇聯之一大打擊</h3>
<p>路透社十九日倫敦電　路透社外交訪員稱、自南期拉夫與希臘相繼為納粹軍隊蹂躪　、土國乃更受德方迫其加入軸心之壓力、不獨愛琴海島嶼之被德方佔領、使土國受德國攻其最弱防錢之危險、且關係最密切的鄰國、亦為環境所迫、不能予土國以絲毫援助、土國戰具來源素恃法國、自法國失敗、土國大受影響、土國在此情形中、其不能不在有限範圍內與德國成立妥協也、自無足異、德國原欲强迫土國廢除對英之條的　務、或依允德軍假道土境、但十國保持其主權、堅不為動、此尤足多者、土國不僅保持不與聞戰爭之現有地位、且於維持其主權與土地完整時、表示忠於英·土盟的中所載好意與友誼之精神、今德·土新條的明白保留土國前有之義務、故可斷定德國雖竭力宣傳此的之重要性而希圖以此為對蘇神經戰之一部、但此的不致摧毀土國對英之友誼、亦不致使土國作妨害英國之行動、當此談判進行時、英當局固獲聞一切也、</p>
<p>艾登地位　不致動搖</p>
<p>合衆社十倫敦電外國使館及負責英人、昨日研究結果、認定德·土兩國友好倏的、為對蘇一大打擊、倫敦觀察家對德·蘇緊張情勢、極為重視、有人料及、希特勒之所以遲遲向蘇提出正式要求者、即係等待拉攏土耳其就範之後、使蘇·土兩國之聯誼削弱、但英評論家亦多堅持土·德之訂新的、仍使英·土同盟條的完全有效、安加拉或將再發一聲明證實此事也、外國使館人員則以為、德。土倏的乃係德國在土漸取得英國勢力而代之表微、實代表地中海東部之一新軍事情勢、德國旣已滅巴爾幹克里特十二列島、現又使土耳其海岸無英海軍立足之地、但亦信土國並未允許德軍及戰具過境、不過德國日後自不免繼紋增加在土之權力也、至此的對伊朗之影響、亦深於德國有利、此消息昨夜尚未在倫敦發表、大的不致動搖央外相艾登之地位、官方仍確申駐蘇大使克利浦斯、除非德·蘇開戰外、仍將返莫斯科、即使開戰、如蘇方表示願與英國談判條件、克利浦斯亦仍可返任、</p>
<h3>歐戰叢談（六）（四）　歐戰與美國民意</h3>
<p>美國會參加歐戰嗎？這是世界各國人土所注意的一大問題。茲將紐的泰晤士報的紀載詳錄如下：</p>
<p>美國高勒普及普林斯頓兩個民意測騐所，十六個多月以來，不斷測騐歐戰對於美國民意的影響，並探求其與時俱進的原因。</p>
<p>最近測騐的結論是：（一）主張美國應向德義兩國宣戰的雖佔少數，但絕大多數的咸主張，倘若別無擊敗「軸心國」的途徑，則美國應當參戰；（二）贊成加緊援英的聲勢日壯，為使援英政策得收實效起見，大多數且主張實行護航，即派遣軍艦保護商船運送軍需，接濟英國。</p>
<p>根據上面的結論，各方的意見雖似背道而馳，實則不然。美國一大部份人堅持必須擊敗德國，倘使英國不能獨仟艱鉅，美國即當加加入戰爭。於是發生一個事實的問題：美國倘不參戰，央國能否獲勝？</p>
<p>美國人被率直地問及應吾對德義宜戰，提出肯定答案的僅佔百分之十。但民意測騐，原視問題的內容而異，他們被問及一般援英問題的時候，却有百分之七十七主張加緊援英，百分之六十二以為冒戰爭風險而援助英國，較避不捲人戰爭漩渦允為重要。據高勒普在五月初頭發表的報告，全國三分之二的人民，都以為林白上校對於戰爭的論調，和他們見解大相逕庭，可為明證。</p>
<p>關於護航問題，據高勒普最近報告，國民全數百分之四十贊同護航，百分之七十一認為挽救英國失敗，非護航不為功。至於接受測騐的人，贊成護航的佔百分之七十二。</p>
<p>去年春季，眞正戰事尚未發作時，　國人都以為英法無需美國助戰，定可獲勝。接着英　聯軍在荷蘭比利時及法國相繼敗挫，一般人以為英國獲勝希望微薄，美國不必去冒戰爭的風險。但英國宣佈繼續作戰後，以一切代價支援英國的論調又提高起來了。</p>
<p>美國人在今年四月初頭，相信央國可以戰勝的，達四分之三以上，相信德國可以戰勝的，佔百分之五，其餘模稜兩可。英國海軍在地中海大敗義大利艦隊及南斯拉夫發生政變後，美國的樂觀察氣又達最高峯。及至五月初，雅典陷落，美國人相信英國，仍可獲勝的降至百分之五十二，預料德國獲勝的，佔百分之十八，意見不定的佔百分之廿二，逆料戰局混沌的佔白分之八。</p>
<p>但在此一時期內，國民對於政府的政策，並無多大異議。相信冒戰爭風險援英，優於置身事外的，自百分之七十降至百分之六十二。主張對德宜戰的略為增加，贊成護航的比前更多。英國在巴爾幹失利後，贊助孤立派的人增加百分之八，但同時主張以一切代價援助英國的也有相等的增加。</p>
<p>美國國民對於特別問題的答案，允其是牽涉到戰爭一般複雜重大的事件，往往易生誤會。那些中張美國不應捲入戰爭漩渦的人，可以引證民意測騐結果說，全國贊成參戰的僅佔百分之十。那些主張美應冒戰爭風險而援英的，也可振振有辭地說，民意測騐結果與他們有利。</p>
<p>我們如將美國的民意，仔細分析，就可發現美國人大抵分為下列五派：</p>
<p>（上）大的半數的人民，以為英國苟無美國不能取勝，美國應不惜一戰，予以援助，並信德國若果勝利，十年之內，必將進攻美國，控制美國的商業和國外市塲，剝奪美國的自由，使美國不得不維持堅固的國防，支出龐大的國防費，陷國民於貧困之境。</p>
<p>（二）大的百分之十五的人民，以為英國苟非美國援助，不能取勝，美國當不惜一戰，予以援助，但小信德國勝利，會發生上述的可怖結果。其中有的震於德國的侵略行動，有的是親夾派，有的簡直和侵略國勢不兩立。</p>
<p>（三）大的百分之二十的人民，以為美國應避不捲入戰爭漩渦，即令德國勝利後，轉而攻擊美國，控制其貿易，剝奪其自由，縮减其生活享受，亦不稍變。其中一部份以為英國無需美國援助，可獲勝利，美國實無進一步冒戰爭危險的理由。另一部份人相信，承認德國的勝利優於美國捲人戰爭　渦。</p>
<p>（四）另有百分之十五，以為美國應避小捲人戰爭漩渦，並信德國即使獲勝，美國不致遭受攻擊，對外貿易不致為其妨礙，一般生活安適如常。須至美國果眞迺受侵略或已遭受侵略的時候，他們纔贊成作戰。</p>
<p>（五）另有百分之三至十，沒有多大意見，他們不知道自己對於戰爭有何見解。其中大部份對於戰爭趣味索然。</p>
<p>要之，熱烈主張參戰的，大多數係南部中等或上等抱益，年在三十歲以上的大學畢業生。嚴格的孤立派，大多對係中西部沒有受過大學教育的年輕婦人，或係年紀五十歲以上收入不豐沒有受過充分教育的男子。</p>

<h3>糧食　米蠧野心終難戢</h3>
<p>到貨新定雖源源而絕　行市仍被抬起四元左右</p>
<p>洋米昨市初漲轉疲終又上升、各檔行情又在盤旋局勢中繼續增高、英華司回籠原包貨有客　貪辦、更見活潑、且因新定價格被增加水脚而報漲、執貨者尤為居奇扳抬、惟新交易源源不絕、昨日計有合義拋出七月上小絞五百噸、價為一百四十三元五角半、新昌盛拋出二號暹邏一千噸、價為一百三十四元、據傳水脚加增二十五先令、故定價加高、二號暹邏前定祇一百三十元、昨乃加起四元、因此市上回籠貨亦自一百三十二元開價大至一百三十四元、一號西貢漲至一百四十四元、小絞規路均至一百四十四五元、碎米現一百十四五元、六下七上初開一百零九元半、繼至一百十元零五角、午後客囤活躍不已、小絞又加一元為一百四十六元、而碎米因客囤納胃更貪、期貨亦到一百十二元、比之前日較大二三元不等、成交約有二千多噸、現貨亦開二萬包、行情早市已經槃漲一二元、後市雖無正式交易、而貨方喊價亦復拉高一二元、收盤一號西貢為百二十六元、次至百二十四元、二號百十八元、百十七元半、小紋浦東棧百二十元、浦西棧百十九元半、敏黨自二十四五元、東京砶尖特自百十四元、次至百十一元、碎尖九十七元、次至九十四元、</p>
<p>工部局洋米接連而來、怡和洋行源生輪、前日由印度來滬、經香港裝來工部局洋米九千九百六十九包、另有洋米八千四百二十八包、係轉船運往天津、該洋米起卸於浦東其昌棧、工部局之洋米、該輪於昨晨移靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、雖貨主見洋米一再飛騰、心羨欲與　漲、奈本鄕店銷因時屆霉令、未敢多進、致無能為力、結果售價懂堪勉提元砠而已、計開南港新鮮早晚稱高自白三十五元、次至百三十三元、宿次百二十一元、百三十元、無錫原包宿粳百二十五六元、</p>
<p>糯米際此佳檔、去路雖絞增多、但以時已落令、終屬不廣、故亦難與洋米並論、若香港貨僅見增元許、開團粒元百十八九元、長粒元百十六七元、中百十五元、糯菉百十元、次至百零六七元、惟國元以前數輛他貨一再高漲之際、此獨平平、致今價別失衡、切覺賤廉、突引起大戶吸收、市面騾起變化、一躍突升三元之巨、高貨竟開百二十五六元、次亦須百二十二三元、</p>
<p>洋粉拾級上騰</p>
<p>麵粉　現洋粉市况、頗有拾級上騰之勢、良以連日本客銷塲頗佳、更在國際風雲緊迫之期、深恐洋粉後到不繼、且國產新小麥來源被由、致使八心節節向榮、囤戶收買日衆、市面逐步抬高、金龍粉初由三十一元昂至卅一元四五角、下午冉升至三十一元八角、砲台粉三十二元四角至三十二元七角、花島紛漲達三十三元高峰、比上日又升七八角、其他各種雜牌、莫不同時扳俏、惟實銷不貪、尙在檳持中、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日小麥交易、亳無做開、蓋以新麥來申、殊多週折、即日廠辦貨、亦在被禁之例、恐一時無法暢通、故市面停頓如常、</p>
<h3>雜糧　生豆油潛勢俏俐</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧市况、在人心牽動之下、各笚市價、一致由疲轉緊、苞米晨初初初先漲元許、結果回平、成交三千餘包、紅糧比前已漲起二三元不等、新蠶豆亦提升半元有奇、黃豆因餅市醖釀不前、大局昨雖見砌二三角、但呈外强內弛、油市在本週內、因餅市乏興奮刺激、一般投機作家藉銷塲尙有問津之機、又動囤油腦經、故不論花生油豆油明雖似蝸牛式之爬行、然比本月內之最低價已騰漲十一二元、昨大連豆油開四百桶、價詳市價欄、大有廠豆油一百担、膠州生油五十件、烟台生油二十件、靑島生油三十桶、江北生油二百聽、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯補空反動回緊</h3>

<h3>紗花　粵銷又見熱鬧　紗價回升</h3>
<p>由一四七五元起　抬至一五〇五元</p>
<p>槃旋兩日之紗市昨則復趨上升、此內香港幫採辦現紗、又見熱鬧、買變馬四百包、同時標金回高、致人心良好、浮空復來抵補、因之漲風即起、空頭掉期貼出二角半、目前紗市走勢、殊覺峯固、泰半因廠單抽緊、原料趨昂、港幫需要繼續不懈、所以市面基礎堅硬矣、不過空頭仍依國際局勢不佳、傾向拋空、兩方爭持仍烈也、二十支雙馬高價為一千五百〇四元、低價為一千四百七十五元、午後初做一千五百〇五元、回至一千四百九十四元、旋以標金上升、隨之漲至一千五百〇四元、最後價為一千五百〇一二元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上午後人心不佳、市象續疲、首盤價為　千四百八十元、此盤一開、賣者紛紛、少頃跌至一千四百七十五元、但盈利者扒袖、又復回好至一千四百八十七八元、檳特甚久、嗣後標金　高、買風騾熾、市槃突然趨漲、昂至一千五百〇四元收盤、查半日間成交統計八千包、內香港幫進一千包、同行七千包、</p>

<h3>棉市依然挺秀</h3>
<p>現棉情况、依然俏利、細絨棉市上好貨缺乏、所以美棉雖回疲、然人心依舊挺秀、而同業皮球交易、極其興盛也、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市况因美棉略跌而稍覺平淡、同時又因紗市繼續趨漲、及國際形勢展開有利、而人心看高、昨日廠購雖靜、但各花號仍有少數巴西棉成交也、又印棉一批、直接運來、怡和洋行源生輪前日到滬、由喀爾喀搭運來棉花一千件、昨停　斯福碼頭起卸、</p>
<h3>糖市　出口證尙未實施　荷糖漲勢轉緩</h3>
<p>前日外傳荷印糖貨、出口證湖行將實施、故糖價轉緊、但昨據荷印代表負責聲明、該出口證制、短期內決不實行、因此市勢回平、查大津幫連日購辦粗白及荷赤九達萬包之譜、去化尙稱活動、公曾划盤現貨一四粗白六月份到新貨九十一元半、至九十二元、路貨九十二元二角、五月份入口九十一元至九十一元六角、三月份人口八十八元六角、後為八十九元四角至八十九元、荷赤KD嘜七十一元七角至七十二元、NT嘜六十八元半、太古車白B嘜東棧一百〇六元三角至六元、DY嘜東棧九十五元、HX嘜東棧九十元、HM嘜七十五元至七十六元、均見、昨有精一千一百五十五包自香港來、又有二千包則係轉運天津、爪哇精漿來三百噸、</p>
<h3>疋頭　色白布無一不漲</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市微挺、本客　色布交易漸增、染廠擇廉搜購坯布、而粗布斜紋以廠盤堅昂、人心穩定、廉額手貨缺乏躉批、結果白貨粗細布斜紋一部份漲二角半之譜、藍布級呢嗶嘰漲（每疋二角半至三角、本街成交各布三百餘件、浙東定海劑辦色布府綢粗布等五六十件、港幫辦華豐藍布大新色斜等貨二百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　因淪陷區客需漸旺、搬出證又祇限於日廠出品、故白貨角貨一致上騰、尤以四君子嗶嘰漲勢最烈、晨開每碼一元四角九分二厘半、步漲至一元五角二分半、收盤時略回為一元五為二分二厘半、約升每碼三分許、但囤戶搜羅仍不遺餘力、棧軍根子愈緊、有繼漲增高之象、龍頭細布本月份期貨結果漲七角、現棧單交易淡、漲五角、晚收為四十五元二角半、</p>
<h3>五金　美狹條鐵　開價高昂</h3>
<p>二百磅　狹條鐵交易、因本街查烟廠·印刷廠玩具廠·等之相率採納、故市象殊呈熱狀、人心亦覺奮發、兼之海外來路斷檔、本埠所存又雹聞價十分高昂、昨每箱二百磅統花色沽四百元關外、而揀花色一時無售、查大尺寸者現貨更缺之故也、並探悉滬市五金貨物中以馬口鐵一項存底為最息即美狹條鐵亦屬其中花色之一、流遺貨亦十分單薄</p>

<h3>日艦結集南駛　將對荷印作威脅　美郵船旅客見各種日艦　衆信日方不致貿然行動</h3>
<p>美國總統輪船公司柯立芝總統號郵船、前晚準照預定時間、於九時（海關鐘）進吳淞口、十時半駛抵十一·十二號浮筒繫泊、在滬留泊二十二小時、已於昨日下午五時二十分（夏季鐘）解纜啟椗、七時出吳淞口、直駛檀香山、遄返舊金山、據該輪旅客言、當本星期二日午後、柯立芝總統號破浪向上海駛來時、船上搭客向右遠眺、忽見地平錢上有斑斑黑影、排列整齊、頗以爲異、</p>
<p>日艦多艘　發現海上</p>
<p>旋霧一度展　、黑斑全明、凝目觀之、均係日艦、內巡洋艦·潛艇·驅逐艦·戰艦與航空母艦俱有、正向南駛、其地點的相對厦門海岸、距柯立芝總統號右側的十二哩、時視錢頗明晰、搭客羣集欄杆旁眺望、不用望速鏡、亦能辨明各艦級位、</p>
<p>指點艦數　五十三艘</p>
<p>傳日艦之數共逾百艘、從柯立芝總統號遙瞻、共見的五十艘、有人一一計之、共得五十三艘、多數似屬驅逐艦與潛艇、率先行駛者、爲戰艦四或五艘及航空母艦一艘、旋見左側亦有數艦、相近海岸而行、僅巨型潛艇一艘、離柯立芝總統號頗近、</p>
<p>衆信或係　恫嚇荷印</p>
<p>或謂日艦南行、諒係日本在南太平洋有重大行動之謂、另有若干人則信日艦南駛、旨在恫嚇荷屬東印度、使其在巴達維亞近所舉行之經濟談判中作重要讓步、無論其意究竟何在、乘柯立芝總統號撤退之旅客、目覩日艦南駛、終無欣慰之感、查柯立芝總統號今次橫渡太平洋返美後、將改成陸軍運輸艦、關於大隊日艦南駛之說、上海日海軍發言人謂「今無正式消息、故不能　表言論」、</p>
<p>英國決心　保衛香港</p>
<p>據最近將出版之密勒氏評論所載、據國民通訊社消息、廣東省政府將撤退香港及澳門之僑民、而由內政部撒僑委員會主持之、然華人在香港有一百三十萬、在澳門有二十萬、即如彼等願意、事實上亦頗難撤退、大概此一消息、乃華方鑒於香港受有日方嚴重之威脅而起、中日戰事發生後、日本即以掃除中國　外國根據地爲唯一目的、</p>
<p>外人在中國　最後之根據</p>
<p>例如天津租界已失本來面目、威海衛英國租借地移至艦上辦公、漢口已被日軍佔領、漢口之法租界亦　受日方支配、而厦門之公共租界、尚能維持至今者、乃係日方之例外、香港今已成爲外人在中國最後之根據矣、日方將一俟英國在歐洲受極度窘迫後、即開始侵略此遠凍之中國最後殖民地、</p>
<p>日或以壓力　作經濟侵略</p>
<p>惟日本鑒於義大利在歐洲之失敗、故未俟英國筋疲力盡後、似不擬有所舉動、且美國亦與香港有關、日本軍人、似不得不有所顧忌、據中國財政部次長兪鴻鈞氏聲稱、渠不信日本將以軍事侵略香港、惟當集中力量作經濟之侵略、兪氏此論殊屬有識之見、</p>
<p>各種措置　抵禦侵略</p>
<p>因香港自被日軍封鎖與中國沿海隔絕後、港地各物高漲供應爲難，良以香港素乃仰給中國內地之出產、一旦被日軍封鎖後、自無法獲得外來之供給、勢將成爲死市、從而日軍以此爲要挾、將强迫香港不得不步越南之後塵、香港具有軍事之重要性外、更爲重慶對外交通航空綫之終點、及汎美航空公司之太平洋西方終點、故日方因之更加重視、然英人一再聲明決心保護香港到底、一視該處最近之種種措置、當信英方之言爲不謬也、</p>
<h3>標準無綫電公司　材料被搬　經日方連去並拘一人</h3>
<p>法租界貝禘鏖路一四二弄九號、爲港滬無錢電堆棧、又名標準無綫電公司、忽於前晚深夜、被日方憲兵司令部派憲兵投法捕房請求派出中西探會同馳往、巡視一過後、旋將該棧內所堆無經電材料搬去、并將派駐該棧看守之華人一名併予逮捕帶去、聞事後日憲兵又會同公共捕房往愛多亞路成都路口浦東大樓某號房問內搬去同樣村料一部份、</p>

<p>勞方善后</p>
<p>至於勞方爲促使公司將來實行儘先錄用之諾言計、決組織解職同人委員會、登記此次被裁　人總數、並加以統計與技術之分析、備公司於業務上需要進用職工時督促賞現、至於在職同人、維持最低工資率、兩氏答以公司對於同人生計、隨時予以注意、此次亦將予充分考慮、不久自將實行、尚有短工問題、經最後力爭、由送薪一個月增至三個月、外加折扣薪水、聞公司於短期內、略加整埋、即將復業、所有此次工業料詳細調解經過、勞方將繕報告、於一二日內可分寄同人、</p>

<h3>充滿樂觀前進氛圍　大後方的印象　千錘百鍊中孕育新朝氣　一切人力物力在活躍着</h3>
<p>聖经公会牧師演講自由中國游程</p>
<p>本埠國際扶輪社於昨日中午，假福州路都城飯店舉行午餐常會，由社長即現任荷駐滬總領鮑賽文氏主席，除報告經常社務外，特請該社社員現任香港路五十八號聖經公會幹事赫七帕斯牧師（Rev.　WilliamHuespeth）　演講「自由中國一瞥」（Glimpsesin　Free　China）。赫氏於今年四月四日離滬，赴西南籌劃教會事務，足跡遍歷重慶·成都·及昆明各後方重鎮·旋以公畢，於上月三十日返滬。昨日所講，即將在自由中國所見之各種動態，作一概括之抒述。赫氏長辭令，善詼諧，聽者無不動容，猶如親歷其境也。</p>
<p>重慶山城　活力揚溢</p>
<p>赫氏於今年四月四日離滬後，海航至港，而後搭機由港飛渝。所乘之機，極爲新式，故行程舒適愉快。迨抵重慶，即下機赴騐關房受檢，所有檢關　對於外籍旅客，有禮貌，處處顧慮周到。赫氏因代友人帶物赴蓉，檢查時稍起誤會，迨解釋淸楚，疑團盡釋，騐關員遂請罪而去。赫氏謂：「設華人赴美，在抵埠被檢，騐關員恐不致以華籍騐關員對待吾八之態度待之。」重慶附近多山，行人多雇山輿或人力車代步，其價頗昂，而攀山踰嶺，險象環生，幾有行小得也之慨。渠繼稱，在重慶所得第一個印象，雖爲一難以言喩之悲苦，」人民衣着不全者有之，骯髒污穢者有之，其所受之苦難　所感之憂慮，遠過於滬人，但不論老幼男女，不論職業階級，人民均有堅强之毅力與氣魄，不爲戰爭之苦難所栘，而猶埋頭苦幹，爲建國之大業努力，此爲渠所得最深刻之印象。</p>
<p>隨毀隨建　巿容煥然</p>
<p>重慶屢遭轟炸，故全巿防空壕所在皆是，一旦警報長鳴，羣赴壕內躱避。唯以重慶地少人多，故近來遣散工作，積極實行，空襲之爲窖雖烈，房屋坍毀，人民罹難，但重慶之復興建設工作，絕未蒙父任何影響，隨建隨毀，隨毀隨建，故市容　然如昔。重慶乃後方交通重鎮，貨運輻輳，而由滇緬內運之貨物如汽油等等，咸集於此，因之一旦空襲發生，對於貨物所加之戚脅，至重且鉅，故一遇警報大作之時，輒由大批工作人員將方行卸下或尚未安置之貨物，移至安全地點，一俟空襲過去，仍繼續進行起卸或裝運。此種工作，雖極繁重，但工作人員而無怨色，剛强壯膽，意識淸楚，以反抗悲慘之遭遇，共百折不撓，堅强不屈之精神，直可驚大地而泣鬼神，外人目擊此景，歎爲觀止。赫氏在渝逗留將旬，乃啟程赴蓉，　察當地教會事工。</p>
<p>成都已成　爲文化城</p>
<p>在成都所得最深刻之印象，厥爲非常時期教育工作之發達，中學大學林立，學生極多，幾有人滿之患，而一般難民，茅屋爲舍，生活艱苦，但仍得享受教育之機會。「難民教授」，從事施救，諄諄善誘，民智大開，結果良好。成都少有空襲，故防空壕亦不多見，而事實上成都地質堅厚，不易掘設防空壕，有之，共造價亦高昂不堪，故一員空襲發生時，人民多四散鄉下。成都附近水利工程發達，溝渠縱橫，灌溉農田，收成殊豐，而民性沉着，歷久不變，即二千年後，猶必能進行如常。唯當地生活程度日高，物價暴漲，較之戰前，幾達十倍，一般苦工如人力車夫等，每日進益十二　至十五元者，不以爲奇，其收入幾可超過高尚之博士，但一般公司職員階級，則所得無多，處境故極困難，而勞工大衆，竟能以較輕之工作：易得較多之報酬。</p>
<p>昆明表現　簇新姿態</p>
<p>赫氏在蓉理公半月，遂搭機南下昆明。氏前駐昆辦公，故人地熟悉，惟近年來之昆明，顯已有重大之變化，街道修闊，商店滿充奢侈之品，與五年前大不相同。交通方面，亦有新發展。五年前，赫氏在昆時，僅有鐵路一，現增至三條，除滇越鐵路外，新增之兩條，一爲滇緬鐵路，雖祗完成十二英哩，但每日有車兩班行駛，他一爲叙昆鐵路，現在積極建築中。交通運輸之建築與發展，不因戰事而停止。各種工業，亦有驚人發展，製造各種用品，成績斐然，尤以靑年之活動，更使昆明平添蓬勃之生氣。赫氏在昆，曾遭兩度猛烈轟炸，平民罹難，難以數計，四肢被炸不全者有之，家破人亡者有之，婦女懷抱嬰兒同時另携一孩奔走痛哭，不知所從者有之。此捙慘象，實令人不忍卒睹。</p>
<p>一流浪兒　可歌可泣</p>
<p>赫氏在毘明時，會遇一十四齡之負販，詢其家世，原籍漢口，三年前漢口淪陷，家破人亡，孑然一身，乃飄泊流蕩，步行千餘英哩方抵昆明。行程耗時數年，賴負販所得以維生計，詰以今後行止，無以爲答，謂繼續流蕩，不知何以爲家也。此一故事，乃中華民國國魂所寄，中國作戰數牛，而人民猶感樂觀，絕無怨言，矢志不移，繼續前進，迄千年萬年而不止，改良今日之世界，追求愉快之生活。又訊，據自由中國來人談，戰後西南各省之發展，雖未登峯造極，但在此短時期間中，整頓改良，竟有此等成績，可謂舉世無匹；而尤以剛毅之風氣，勤奮之操作，卓越之精神，鎮靜之態度，給予中國蓬勃之生氣活力與希望，保證中國生存不息，永爲世界民主陣營之一員。作戰四年，精神堅强如初，此實爲中國不可屈服之象徵，而爲最後勝利之基礎也。</p>
<h3>米價忽漲係做高　居民切勿爭購　當局所訂洋米平抵滬　黨米合理加價爲數甚微</h3>
<p>現在時局消息、隨時變動、而一般米蠢竟屢次造謠生事、近又活動、竟使米價步步上漲、租界當局深恐各雜糧行藉此時機、私抬售價、或囤積不售、昨特令平米代辦機關　知雜糧行、凡屬每包以一百二十四元七角訂購之小絞米、目下轉售與零售米號、價目仍爲一百三十三元五角、不得任意抬高、目應將訂購貨色、儘量轉售、不得囤積居奇、若有違反者一經查出、當受嚴厲之處罰、同時工部局爲澈底調查各雜糧行轉售由局方印製成交單表格一種、可向立基洋行購備、經核准後、始得成交、</p>
<p>預購貯藏　實爲不智</p>

<p>平米重量　應加注意</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉、各米號出售工部局港米、已往每石斤量、大都均祇市秤一百五十六斤、而購米市民、雖有向米號詰問、而米號輙以按照向例、及須剔除蔴袋車量爲言、故市民亦深價不疑、茲據米號英公會之通告、足證一百六十市斤、係足净數、米號所謂蔴袋等藉口、完全欺矇顧客而已、至以後米號出售之港米、當能以足數應售、惟巳往被其尅扣者、似亦有澈究必要、此事有望於租界常局嚴厲　置、而米號業公會、亦應檢　、勿容姑息、而重民食、</p>

<h3>信不信由你　借錢的藝術</h3>
<p>— 葛亮</p>
<p>據說，借錢也有藝術。</p>
<p>有許多人不得已而去借錢，可是往往雙手空空的回來·原因是缺乏借錢的藝術。</p>
<p>當你穿着破舊不堪的衣服，踏進他家客堂時，先給他一個不好的印象；再加上你的一付憂急的臉巴，更　他掃興，你雖　百般奉迎着他，你雖　抑止着自己的心意，順合他的語鋒，可是　你一提到自己的經濟困難，對方先發制人，向你滔滔不絕訴說他的苦衷，並目還日若懸河地　揮他的牢騷，弄得你開日不得，唉，誠誠心心，不遠千里而來，結果撞了一鼻子灰回去，這是不懂借錢的藝術。</p>
<p>要借錢，先得整備一套華服，即使買不起，不妨借一套，可能的話，租一部黑牌汽中，到那家門口，三聲喇叭，主人趨出接客時，應該滿面春風地迎上去：（有時候，也應該帶去一部厚重的禮物，因爲釣魚要用魚餌的。）談吐間，須大誇近狀之得意，（即使斷炊三日，也祇可以自己肚中明白。）並且你不妨說：『老兄，近來怎樣？假使需要我幫忙的話，區區一萬或五千總可以兜得轉的，經過一番高談闊論以後，才對他說，這幾日來銀行錢莊不便，向他商量一百或五上，哈！結果圓滿，對方慷慨解囊，一些不猶豫。</p>
<p>用理論研究了六百零七次才、理　借　藝術的原理。因爲看見你窮，借了怕你不還，所以一　闊，他心中以爲有些那個了。</p>
<p>於是開始實騐，試騐了十五次半。（半次者爲造訪不遇也。）</p>
<p>結果是高興借給你的不待你開口，已經誠懇地拿出來了。吾則，……否則，唔……否則也是枉然的。</p>
<h3>墨妙欣賞記</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>明文徵仲與唐六如書云：閱畫冊二十幀，悉仿唐宋諸家作也，或秀麗，或龍疏，各極其致，眞畫苑之集大成者。予愛慕之切，不忍釋手，昔米顚袖中有奇石，孰若此中丘壑，令人臥遊不盡也。予於謝子閒鷗之畫冊亦云然。謝子近來擯絕塵事，益銳　於丹靑，而藝乃高超雋逸，幾奪古人之席而有之：目富創造性，不肯拘拘於陳規舊稿，每有所作，輒以其胸中之丘壑，而爲腕下之丘壑，於是筆底烟雲，楮端跡象，聚精會神於尺幅間，得者拱璧珍之。而謝子每逢自愜之品，往往攝影以留其興，製珂羅版印行，都二十幅，集分平裝精裝兩種。其中人物仕女佛像山水詩意及故事等，應有盡有，而螺殼道塲，史具芥子須彌之致，使觀者驚奇，歎爲妙構。蓋極筆墨之變幻，而得個中之一昧者已。（按閒鷗畫集，本巿科學儀器館，世界書局有售。）</p>
<h3>病中</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>這年頭，倒霉的儘會倒霉下去：飯尚恐吃飽之不易，又生起病來了！</p>
<p>第一天，倒也別有風味。事情固然可以不必做，飯又能現成推上嘴來，挺開心的。</p>
<p>二天一過，不對了！睡得頭昏腦脹；而且飯變成了粥（理由是生病），推上嘴變成了要自己「開尊口」，便有些乾急起來。</p>
<p>踏上第四天，形勢更壤，人似乎像，「鬼形」。我主張吃藥，話還沒說完一半，就險些嚐了個嘴巴子！</p>
<p>從瞌目閉口，再不敢響上一響。</p>
<p>畢　「天無絕人之路」，躺了幾大，也居　「貴恙坐愈」：我想大概不是「祖宗」來救我，就是肚子裹白血球還沒有死光……</p>
<p>仔細想：啼笑皆非！</p>
<h3>速寫</h3>
<p>— 燿燿</p>
<p>在　個小弄堂口，有一人正在把褲帶繫得緊些。</p>
<p>「你在這裏偷偷摸摸地榦什麼？」原來是巡捕先生來了。</p>
<p>那人回過頭來，一陣苦笑：「先生，我是在吃飯呀：」</p>
<p>一家影戲院門口，人擠得像潮水一般，大家都在爭購票子。</p>
<p>一我們眞像是搶　平糶米的平民，哈哈！」一個靑年說。</p>
<p>「不過，他們是爲的肚子，我們是爲的眼睛。」另一個靑年回答。</p>
<p>接着有好幾個人笑了起來。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鳿</p>
<p>（九）一個古怪的荘稼人</p>
<p>「這一次不去，以後怕小會再有這種機會了！」他很疲乏地退往坑上去坐着，腦神經却還是不停的在轉動。」假使不等奶媽子一家回去，就能把湘綺我到，夫妻母女三個人，悄悄地搬出李家莊，再在別處安居起來，那是多麼完美的事啊？」</p>
<p>想到這裹，他差一些就要笑出來了。</p>
<p>當他把腦袋擱到枕上去的時候，明犬就出門的主意才算打定了，雖然還有許多怪困難的問題，在他心頭阻梗着，不曾獲得解決，但這些也就是他自己的力量所不能解決的了！</p>
<p>「除非能够意外的找到玉崑。」一個徼倖的想頭，突然湧了起來。可是實際上，玉崑目從前年來過一次以後，也是一直下落不明；因爲這個傢伙向來有那麼一種狗脾氣，甯可殺頭，再也不願提起筆桿寫信，所以秋海棠要希望找到他，眞是最沒有把握的事。</p>
<p>這一夜，速秋海棠自己也不知道是怎機挨過去的，左一個念頭，右一個念頭，使他的腦神經再也不能有半分鐘的甯靜；分叫是睜大着眼，在瞧那一盞煤油燈，但眼前却似乎又現出了許多的夢境。他好像看見羅湘綺已經死了，遠在袁寶藩失敗以前已死了；又像看見玉崑正和袁老七打架；一會兒，趙四那一條矮胖的身影又出現了，彷彿正捧着那一個已經不值一文的存摺，跑在東省殖邊銀行的門口放聲人哭；再過了一會，他好像又夢見小梅寶已給王四夫婦拐走了……。</p>
<p>「天啊！這一夜爲什麽這樣長啊？」五點鐘不到，他便一路詛咒，一路輕手輕脚的爬了起來。</p>
<p>還好，小梅寶倒依舊睡得很熟。（一三七）</p>
<h3>聚餐　珍饈難下咽　寒酸作已是槖</h3>
<p>— 鍾文苓</p>
<p>當行裹的協理先生微詢我的意見，問我是吾願意參與星期日中午的聚餐時，我眞覺得有些當寵若驚；因爲普通說起來，主任和高級職員方是他邀請的對象。對於這次的破例，當時脫口便回答「好」，然而繼而一想，他講的是聚餐，而非請客，自　每人都得拿出一些錢來。在稍爲遲疑之中，他好像有些覺察我的心思：「這次我們訂八十元一席的菜，每人拿出十元左右便足够了。」我不能讓他懷疑到我在肉麻銅鈿，於是裝着爽快的樣子：「決定去！」</p>
<p>在筵席上：精巧的菜餚裝在精巧的器皿中，可笑一道炒蝦仁竟用一個四週環有紅藍小　燈的碟子盛着。大家都一面吃，一面贊美，好好之聲不絕於耳。末了，賬單來了，當一白八十元這幾個字從經理口中宣佈出來的時候，我好像受了當頭一捧，昏迷了好幾分鐘，我突然覺得我受了騙，他們全是大騙子，經理先生騙了我十塊錢，酒店老板也騙了我十塊錢。我想當時若小是早先乾了兩杯的話，面色一定很難看。我蓄意要買十五塊錢一本的Science　For　Citizens不知在店門口巡邏了多少次，在橱窗　觀望了多少次，在書店內撫摩和翻閱了不知父有多少次，結果始終捨不得買。而現在却甯願　去，總之我覺得我上了大當。</p>
<p>然而壤的還在後面。付了賬，他們仍不跑，躺在沙發上，閉上眼睛，剔牙齒，拉東扯西，口口聲聲還在說那菜肴的可口。突然協理先生提議：「直落如何？」王主任首先贊成：「一體蟬聯。」其餘各位齊聲附和：「贊成！」他們的意思是晚上冉米一個，然而我並沒有響，我在想一種不參加的托詞，肚痛嗎？有的嗎？可是當他們眼光都落在我身上時，我却不甘示弱地怒叫聲：「贊成！」這兩個字在那時候聽起來非常孤單不合時宜，而有如野獸被迫發出的呼聲，慘厲而刺耳。</p>
<p>又是在筵席上，精巧的菜餚裝在精巧的器皿中，這次我沒有中午的客氣，我想我非得吃够本不可，拚命往肚子裹塞。然而不知怎的，一點兒滋味也沒有。</p>
<p>晚上，失眠，無論如何睡不着。不知和肚千過飽有無關係。早上跳起來洗了臉，馬上便跑到書店去，將那本心愛的書買來。</p>
<h3>橫豎橫</h3>

<p>位愛吃水果的朋友，共總買了八隻梨十，一口氣吃六隻，拿着其餘的兩隻說：「管他，「橫豎橫」，一道吃光了吧」！</p>
<p>房間裏弄得七零八亂，污烟瘴氣，小人要撒尿，「夫官，就在地上撒吧！「橫豎橫」齷齪了」。</p>
<p>剛從當典裹當去棉被出來，壺花彫，四隻冷盆，「窮：「橫豎橫」是窮定了」。</p>
<p>賭徒連輸了幾千，把最的五百元向檯上一摜，「橫豎橫輸了」。</p>

<h3>初聆徐東明徐東霞</h3>
<p>— 谷梅</p>
<p>卡爾登新從北平邀來徐東明徐東霞姊妹，咋天是她姊妹倆在上海登臺第一天。戲碼是東霞「三堂會審」，東明「空城計」，前塲有武生王仲臣「淮安府」，新鐘八點到塲，已經上「淮安府」，姜雲霞「穆柯寨」沒有趕上，「淮安府」是黃天覇率衆捉拿蔡天化故事，北方列入八大拿，南方武生學此戲却是很少見。王仲臣所演和北方本子不同，北方以黃大覇爲主角，王仲臣自飾賀人傑，完全是南派作風，身手很輕捷，武功也很可觀，可惜沒有嗓子。蔡大化是馬春甫，老了不中用了，這一類脚色李春利李永利王永利王永和都是好手，後輩中沒有出過人材「淮安府」下。休息十分鐘，上「三堂會審」，周維俊王金龍，李蠡甫劉秉義，李瀚三官醫，其中以周維俊最黑色，李鑫車嫌嫩，李瀚三無善可述。徐東霞蘇三面上表情很見功夫，臺步也極穩練，臺風稍欠長，面日旬幾分像姚水娟，嗓子很高亮，作腔多宗程硯秋，而且很會唱，和幾年前胡素仙姪女胡菊芬一般，實在是侯玉蘭的勁敵。以昨天進塲步干來推想，脚底功夫很不錯，刀馬旦戲，一定有根底，是侯玉蘭所不及的。十時上「空城計」，馬謖是黃金班底花臉李克昌，想是周翼華向孫蘭亭商借來的。李克昌在黃金一向是扮司馬懿的，高幼常黃金常用程少餘，昨日演出居然很動神，比較配言菊朋的馬連昆好得多。探子和老軍是貫大元貫盛習的弟弟貫盛吉，此人我在更新見過，據李一車告訴我，盛吉的小花臉戲，都是學蕭二順（長華）的，刺湯」「起解」「出樂」「羣英會」不弱於茹富蕙，後來看他和黃杜秋配戲，的確很可意。這一次演出探子覺得浮滑，老軍又似乎太呆板，好像不是去年的貫盛吉了。王平是卡爾登原人張月亭，起覇開打頗老練，白口，神態，　見功夫，言菊朋唱幾次「空城一，王平都是他，徐東明的老承相諸葛亮，面上一洗坤角習氣，不施脂粉是小冬以外第一人。嗓子高音亮，中音潤，低昔寬，天賦比小冬更好。因爲小冬還有雌音，東明却完全不是坤角嗓子，身上因爲她是擅長馬派戲，致力馬派太深了。雖然唱譚派戲，總不免有馬派身段，所以覺得欠穩重，唱腔白口，很見功夫，惟城樓「我正在城樓觀山景……」一段二六，太唱得花妙，和前後幾段唱腔，完全不像一個人唱。斬謖一塲精神氣魄，就遠不及小冬，不過比張文娟蔣慕萍要老練得多，昨天看東明氣力都很弱，因爲她處處覺得太顧身份了，所以反覺得太平穩，不驚人。不過坤角唱「空城計」有徐東明那樣的成績，孟小冬外，還找不出第二人呢。</p>

<h3>嚴華周璇　談判決裂</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>關於周璇。嚴華婚變的消息，昨天已經詳盡地報道了，這個，正是一個不幸的事件，如果雙方在前因上不走極端，決不會造成悲慘的後果。</p>
<p>正常我們盼望調解人居中勸導，能使雙方互相諒解重好如初的時候，消息傳來，周璇與嚴　在國華主人柳中浩家裏的　判，却是宣告決裂了。</p>
<p>在記者听知，事態是這樣的，他們會面之後，展開談話：</p>
<p>嚴：「爲什麼你要同我離婚？」</p>
<p>周：「爲什麼你打我罵我，你知道我精神的痛苦嗎？與其受苦，不如離婚的好。」</p>
<p>嚴：「我父不是大大打你駡你！」</p>
<p>周：「你打起來，凳子亂擲，簡直在要我命，我實在受够了。你登報說我捲逃，我又沒有逃，銀行裏的存摺，我拿了又沒有去領，何况這些摺子，都是我用汗血賺來的，這是我自己的東西。」</p>
<p>說到這裏，嚴華突然不別而走，於是柳中浩也無從調解，事態終於更嚴重而決裂了。</p>
<p>於這事，嚴華似乎應負責任，因爲嚴華在種種猜忌的心理下，無故壓迫周璇，已是圈內人衆所共知的了。周璇曾有書　給柳中浩，說：「我現在已經決定了，我感覺到不能再同嚴華好下去了，我看他的脾氣很難改，以後下去一定很痛苦，本來我想只有一死，因爲想起上次巡捕房里的人同我說，自殺還不如奮鬥，爲什麼要自殺？（註：周璇會在去年自殺一次，亦爲與嚴華爭吵事。）所以我想只有同他離婚，假如你倆再要　我同他好，那我情願一死了之，實在是他時常　起脾氣駡我，我實在受不了。」同時，周璇在致嚴華的律師信中，其中一段說道：「嚴君冷酷無情，性尤暴躁，家庭之間，一言不合，動輒用武</p>

<h3>「孤島春秋」　觀後</h3>
<p>— 柳沉</p>
<p>在一個黑暗時期的前夜，一些反映牛活和思想的作品，由於環境的感染作者觀點的窒息，極易產生感傷的作品，這作品如果內容不能滲有豐富的現實題材和含有積極的教育意義，其影響的效果便會把人們感情拉到消極的泥坑。</p>
<p>因此我們看到果戈理。莫利哀一類世界藝人對其作品所採取的戰鬬姿態和他們所擷取的諷刺題材以及怎樣巧妙地利用了輕鬆的方式—這是值得後人學習。而且，這一類作品確實是擁有廣大觀衆的。</p>
<p>過去「馬路天使」「十字街頭」所表現的成績便是一個顯明的例子。而年來吳村的作品，就其製作上檢討，有如「新地獄」「黑天堂」之類便是近似這一類型的，尤由其最近上映的「孤島春秋」，更說明吳村在導演手法上的意圖，是過通喜劇形式來教育更落後更龐大的羣衆。</p>
<p>一孤島春秋」是刻劃上海的一些牛活故事，幾個平凡的小市民階層的生活趣味的暴露，看到無數人們在拷栳的圈子裹醉生夢死的活劇，可是生活之外居然還有一些理想，這理想改變了他們對人牛的看法，社會的奮鬬，以及對世界的貢獻—他們是讓理想帶到自由幸福的天地去。</p>
<p>上海人看到上海的生活喜劇，這是一個很好的教育，接受這喜劇所給予教育的必須首先革新自己的生活態度，再進而革新這霉爛的一部份腐臭的世界。</p>

<h3>Demarcation of the Yunnan-Burma Border and the Lufang Mining Area: Original Text of the Sino-British Exchange of Notes Published</h3>
<p>Areas Disputed Over the Years All Demarcated to China. Sino-British Joint Investment in the Exploration and Mining of Lufang Mineral Resources.</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Sino-British exchange of notes on the demarcation of the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma Road was signed at the Foreign Minister's Office at 5:00 PM on the 18th. The Chinese side was represented by Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, Vice Minister Xu Mo, and Director Liu Shishun of the European Department. The British side was represented by British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and Chinese Counselor P.D. Butler. First, Director Liu and Counselor Butler read out the original text of the exchange of notes. Foreign Minister Wang then signed the exchange of notes first, followed by Ambassador Clark Kerr. The Chinese and British sides then simultaneously signed the attached map. Ambassador Clark Kerr and Counselor Butler departed at 6:00 PM. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Sino-British boundary line in the southern section of Yunnan-Burma has been unresolved for a long time. In the winter of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, an incident occurred in which the Burmese side sent personnel to explore the Lufang mining area. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately consulted with the British side and agreed to jointly establish a joint boundary survey committee to conduct on-site surveys in order to seek a fundamental solution. The committee, which included a neutral member appointed by the League of Nations Administrative Council, conducted detailed on-site surveys in the winters of the 24th and 25th years of the Republic of China. All work was completed in April of the 26th year of the Republic of China, and a report was submitted to the Chinese and British governments. Over the years, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been negotiating with the British side in a spirit of harmony, compromise, and efficiency, and a satisfactory resolution has now been reached. The exchange of notes was signed on the 18th. The Ban Hong area, Mengjiao and Mengdong, the western part of Mengka Gongnong Piyong Manhui Townships, and the Yongguang Mengsuo Ximeng areas, which the Chinese side has been contending for over the years, have all been demarcated to the Chinese side, totaling an area of nearly 2,000 square kilometers. As for Lufang, which was originally outside the boundary line stipulated in the old treaty and the yellow line drawn by Le Chen, and which was also ruled by the neutral chairman of the boundary survey committee to belong to the British side, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, considering its close historical relationship with China and as one of the factors proposed by the Burmese side to redraw the boundary line, repeatedly negotiated and finally suggested that the Lufang mineral resources be jointly invested and exploited by China and Britain in the future. After repeated consultations, the British Burmese government agreed to express goodwill. The exchange of notes on this joint exploitation of the Lufang mining area was also signed at the same time.

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Note to the British Ambassador</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 19th – The original text of the Sino-British exchange of notes on the demarcation of the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma border and the joint exploitation of the Lufang mining area is as follows: Foreign Minister Wang's note to the British Ambassador: I have the honor to refer to the exchange of notes signed by your Excellency's predecessor and the then Minister of this Ministry on April 9, 24th year of the Republic of China, which defines the terms of reference for the boundary survey committee responsible for determining the undefined section of the Yunnan-Burma border, and the exchange of notes signed on the same day containing the understanding on the mining area. The joint boundary survey committee was subsequently formally established and, in accordance with its mandate, submitted a report to both governments. The issue of modifying the treaty line found by the committee during its survey has also been jointly assisted by the Chinese government and the government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Burmese government (i.e., the successor to the Indian government) in accordance with the provisions of the additional understanding of April 9, 24th year of the Republic of China. I have the honor to inform Your Excellency that the Chinese government agrees to replace the following boundary line for the boundary line described in Sections 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the Supplementary Treaty between China and Britain signed in Beijing on the 3rd day of the first month of the 23rd year of the Guangxu Emperor (February 4, 1897): (The boundary line starts from the location of boundary marker No. 97 of the already determined northern section, the confluence of the Nanpa River and the Nanding River, and goes upstream along the Nanding River for approximately three miles to Hongtan Village in Bangdao, which is a small hill on the left bank of the Nanding River, where the Sino-British committee built stone pile No. 1 between the 25th year of Guangxu (1898) and the 26th year of Guangxu (1900). The boundary line then runs roughly south along this small hill to stone pile No. 2 where the road between Huban and Mengding crosses this small hill, to reach stone pile No. 3 on the summit of Laixing Mountain (1366). The boundary line then follows the watershed of the Nanda River, including the Nalaixia River (also known as the Gongmeng River, a tributary of the Nanda River, which flows into the river through a natural bridge), and the watershed of the Mankah River and the Xiaonangun River (also known as the Lili River basin), to Mount 2360 (approximately at longitude 98 degrees 57 minutes 14 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 21 minutes 40 seconds north). The boundary line then descends along the nearest tributary of the Nanban River (also known as the Jin River), the source of which is approximately half a mile west of Mount 2303, and follows the Nanzhang River to its confluence with the Danangun River (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 0 minutes 30 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 14 minutes 48 seconds north). The boundary line then follows the Danangun River downstream to its confluence with a tributary on its left bank (approximately at longitude 98 degrees 73 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 13 minutes 20 seconds north). The boundary line then ascends this tributary to its source and goes southeast to a mountain ridge and then to Mount 1970 (approximately at longitude 95 degrees 3 minutes 58 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 10 minutes 42 seconds north). (Then, the boundary line runs south along this mountain range to Mount 1770 (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 3 minutes 27 seconds east, latitude 23 degrees 7 minutes 25 seconds north). The boundary line then runs east along the watershed of the Nangun River and the Nantun River until it meets the watershed approximately one mile south of Mount 2179 (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 10 minutes east, latitude 23 degrees 6 minutes 23 seconds north). The boundary line then runs east along the watershed of the Erjiang River to the south of Mount 2178, and then roughly south through Mount 2196 to reach Mount 1930 (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 34 minutes east, latitude 22 degrees 56 minutes). The boundary line then follows the watershed of the Nanma River basin and the Nankabei River (also known as the Kuli River) and the Nanqigao River basin, first southwest, then west, and finally north to Mount 1523 (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 26 minutes 43 seconds east, latitude 22 degrees 56 minutes 45 seconds north). The boundary line then follows the most prominent tributary of the Nankazhen River downstream and along this river to its confluence with the right tributary at approximately latitude 22 degrees 50 minutes 52 seconds. The boundary line then ascends this tributary west and southwest to its source and crosses the ridge of Mount 12180, which is the highest peak (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 24 minutes 38 seconds east, latitude 22 degrees 48 minutes 37 seconds north), and takes the most direct route to the source of the nearest tributary of the Nansi River, then follows this source downstream to its confluence with the Nanxu River (approximately at longitude 99 degrees 18 minutes 42 seconds east, latitude 22 degrees 44 minutes 18 seconds north). Then, the boundary line descends along the Nanxu River to its confluence with the Nanka River at approximately longitude 99 degrees 23 minutes 20 seconds east, latitude 22 degrees 35 minutes 10 seconds, and then descends along the Nanka River to a boundary marker in the determined southern section. Attached is a map sent by the Boundary Survey Committee. All boundary lines are marked with red lines on the map. I have the honor to request Your Excellency to confirm that the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Burmese Government agree to replace the aforementioned boundary line for the boundary line referred to in Sections 3 and 4 of Article 3 of the Annex to the Sino-British Convention on Burma signed in Beijing on the 3rd day of the first month of the 23rd year of Guangxu (February 4, 1897). I have the honor to request Your Excellency to examine and reply accordingly. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurances of my highest consideration. To His Excellency Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United Kingdom to the Republic of China. Attached: one map.

<h3>Japanese Face Difficulties Whether Advancing South or Attacking Inland China</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Meetings May Raise Discussions: Hua Army Spokesman Declares to the Press</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Hua army spokesman declared when hosting reporters from various newspapers this afternoon that the meeting currently being held by the Japanese authorities in Tokyo is probably debating whether Japan should advance into the South Pacific or attack inland China. Japan will face serious difficulties in both of the above actions. The spokesman said that the Japanese army used a total of eight divisions in the recent battle of Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi, which foreshadows the difficulties of the Japanese army in attacking inland China, because there are dozens of such mountain ranges in the inland. The spokesman also called attention to the fact that more than 100 Japanese warships are now concentrated near the coast of Zhejiang, and their intentions are still difficult to determine. The spokesman finally stated that in the past week, there have only been reports of small-scale military operations on the various Sino-Japanese fronts. Japanese troops in southern Hubei Province have attacked Hua army positions near the border between Hunan and Hubei, but all Japanese offensives have been repelled as of yesterday, and the Hua army is still holding its original positions.

<h3>The Solution to the Sino-Burmese Border Issue</h3>
<p>According to a Chongqing dispatch from the day before yesterday: The Sino-British exchange of notes on the demarcation of the southern section of the Yunnan-Burma Road was signed in the wartime capital on the afternoon of the 18th, detailing the boundary line between Yunnan Province and the Burmese border. This historical issue, which has been pending for more than fifty years, has been rationally resolved after numerous twists and turns in an atmosphere of unprecedented Sino-British friendship. In addition to being worth celebrating, it should also be considered a valuable diplomatic achievement for both China and Britain in the war. Now, let us take a retrospective look at the past history.</p>
<p>The relationship between the Yunnan-Burma border area and China began with Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty's communication with the southwestern barbarians. Its formal belonging to the Chinese territory began in the era of Kublai Khan of the Mongol Empire. The Jinchi Burma Kingdom, Pagan, and Babai Xifu states, which were established in that area, were either conquered by the Mongol army or sent envoys to pay tribute one after another. Throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties, Yunnan was divided into a province, and Burma also paid tribute continuously. In the old Sino-Burmese boundary, which was established before the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, it spanned both inside and outside the Jinsha River, and the ten offices of Mengyang, Menggong, and Mengmi were all within Chinese territory. Later, a new boundary was re-delineated, but because Burma was a Chinese vassal state, many undefined boundaries were not strictly demarcated. In 1886, Britain annexed Burma, and the border negotiation began to form a problem. At that time, the Qing court ordered Prince Qing Yikuang, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, to consult with the British Minister O'Conor on Sino-Burmese relations, and five articles were established, the third of which was: "The Sino-Burmese border shall be jointly surveyed and demarcated by China and Britain." However, in reality, the Qing court delayed and procrastinated, and it was not until 1894 that it sent the British envoy Xue Fucheng to negotiate border affairs with Britain, and 20 articles of demarcation and trade were drawn up, stipulating that the determined boundary would be from Jian Gao Mountain at 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude to the Mekong River bank at 21 degrees 27 minutes north latitude, but among them, from the confluence of the Nanding River Nanbang River at 23 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to the confluence of the Nanma River and Nanchang River near Mengma, only the principles of the boundary line were determined, and its specific demarcation had to be the same as the undetermined boundary from 25 degrees 30 minutes north latitude to the north to Gongshan Administration Bureau. It also has yet to be investigated on the ground, which is also the so-called difference between the southern undefined boundary and the northern undefined boundary. The northern section includes Jiangxinpo and Pianma, and the southern section includes Ban Hong, all of which are familiar disputed areas. However, during the actual survey in 1899, the maps used by both sides differed (that is, the so-called yellow line and red line, and later the so-called green line and blue line, etc., were all proposals regarding the boundary line), and the British side mistakenly pointed to Kongming Mountain as the Gongming Mountain stipulated in the boundary, resulting in large differences in the views of both sides, and no decision could be reached. It has been shelved to this day for more than 40 years.</p>
<p>In those 40 years, because the border was uncertain, disputes occurred between the two sides from time to time. There have been several disturbances in the Jiangxinpo Pianma area since 1910. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, Shuangli also caused major disputes due to the mineral resources near Ban Hong. In view of the fact that the border has been in turmoil for a long time, it is impossible to prevent all kinds of disputes. China and Britain consulted and established a joint survey committee to re-survey the old border. Each of China and Britain sent two members, and the Administrative Council of the League of Nations sent a neutral member to form the committee, which was announced on April 17 of the 24th year of the Republic of China. After the establishment of the committee, it went to the Sino-Burmese border to conduct on-site surveys for two consecutive sessions, and after several negotiations, it finally produced a report in April of the 26th year of the Republic of China; however, due to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War shortly after, there was no time to originally determine the border based on the survey results. This long-pending issue was finally resolved the day before yesterday. The focal points of past disputes between the two sides, such as Ban Hong and Mengdong, were definitively demarcated to the Chinese side, while the issue of the Lufang mining area near Ban Hong was decided to be jointly invested and exploited by China and Britain.</p>
<p>The solution to this historical dispute is naturally an important milestone in China's struggle to improve its international status, and it should also be seen as the beginning of the current British and American authorities' preparation to abolish unequal treaties with China after the war. This should certainly be attributed to the efforts and wisdom of the diplomatic authorities of both China and Britain. On the other hand, it is not because China has strived to resist construction and has been valued by the powers of the world. As long as we continue to strive unremittingly, it is expected that China's diplomatic gains in the future will be a hundred times more than the solution to the Yunnan-Burma border.</p>
<p>The undetermined border between Yunnan and Burma originally had two sections, north and south, but the committee organized in the 24th year of the Republic of China to conduct surveys was limited to the southern section. Although the Chongqing telegram did not clearly point out the longitude, latitude, and four extremes of this demarcation and exchange of notes, a detailed analysis of the meaning of the text probably limited it to the southern section, while the northern section is still an issue to be decided. For the sake of border security and the preservation of good Sino-British and Sino-Burmese friendship, now that the southern boundary line has been determined, the northern section should not be allowed to remain undecided for a long time, although for the sake of Sino-Burmese transportation construction, perhaps the southern section is more important than the northern section. Based on the same spirit and position, I believe that the demarcation of the northern section of the Yunnan-Burma border will not be difficult to obtain the same fair and reasonable solution as the southern border.</p>
<h3>America Rejects German Protest, Limits German Consul's Exit, Unknown What Means Germany Will Adopt, It Is Generally Expected That There Will Be No Break With America Currently</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th - Welles of the State Department told reporters yesterday that he would not release the content of the dispatch sent by the German chargé d'affaires in the United States regarding the closure of German offices in the United States, only that the US authorities were now arranging for the German consul to leave the country. This statement is tantamount to saying that the United States will reject the German protest. Welles said that in accordance with the usual procedures, the United States will ask other warring countries to issue safe conducts for these consuls, and the United States is now trying to arrange for them to return directly to Germany without going to South America. What the German side protested against was the expulsion of the German consul, not the freezing order. Welles also said that the survivors of the American cargo ship Robin Moor had taken excellent photos to confirm that the oral confession of the attacker was a German submarine. It is heard that the German dispatch pointed out that the expulsion of the German consul destroyed the German-American Consular Treaty of 1923, simply temporarily canceling it without giving a year's notice of repeal.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 19th - A high-ranking government official told the Associated Press that although Germany had protested, German consular officials in the United States would still be expelled. This statement was actually a rumor that the British government would reject the German protest. The official also said that the United States has the right to weigh and decide whether a foreign consular official should be allowed to perform his duties, and that Germany had previously asked the United States to withdraw its consular officials stationed in the Netherlands, Austria, and other countries, and the United States had to comply.</p>
<p>Italian Newspapers Still Attack America</p>
<p>Associated Press, Rome, 19th - Under the authorization of the authorities, newspapers here are still unanimously publishing anti-American commentaries, denouncing President Roosevelt's recent order to freeze Axis funds in the United States, in order to provoke the Axis to go to war and thereby avoid the responsibility of involving the United States in the war. Most newspapers said that Rome and Berlin have decided to use appropriate retaliation and avoid increasing the tension between the Axis and the United States. The newspapers also pointed out that Italy's deposits in the United States are only 63 million US dollars, while the property awarded in the United States is 145 million US dollars, so the loss suffered by the United States after freezing Axis funds is even greater than that of Italy.</p>
<p>America Asks Thailand to Pay Off Purchase of Aircraft</p>
<p>Associated Press, Bangkok, 19th - American Minister to Thailand Landon told the Associated Press today that the United States has requested the Thai government to pay off the funds for the aircraft it has ordered, and that the US State Department has sent a dispatch to Gessler, stating that the United States has cooperated with Britain to transport mineral oil to Thailand.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Chinese and American Celebrities Hold a Grand Banquet; Mrs. Bodde, Recently Returned to America from China, Lavishly Praises the Greatness of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and His Wife</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 19th – A total of 1,500 officials, financiers, cultural figures, and business leaders from China and the United States gathered last night at a grand banquet hosted by the United China Relief Fund at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, where they all lauded Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, and strongly supported the movement to aid China. Willkie, a Republican leader in America, presided over the banquet. When Mr. Willkie introduced Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih, Chinese writer Dr. Lin Yutang, Dr. Hornbeck of the State Department, Mrs. Luce Bodde, Mrs. Buck, Mr. Kent, opera and film star Ms. Er, and Mr. Smith, the Democratic presidential candidate in the 1928 election, the audience greeted them with cheers. Mrs. Bodde, a famous writer and playwright, had recently returned from a trip to China with her husband, Mr. Luce, and gave a radio address, praising the morale and endurance of the Chinese army, refugees, and civilians. She also lauded the Christians in China for their faith in God and their courageous spirit of upholding righteousness, helping to protect Chinese women and children. When Mrs. Bodde spoke of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, she said that Generalissimo Chiang and Madame Chiang were known throughout the world as one of the greatest couples, and that in her opinion, they were second only to the Roosevelts of the United States. Generalissimo Chiang and his wife are now dividing the work of national affairs, managing military and political affairs, while Madame Chiang is dedicated to moral and social causes. I admire Generalissimo Chiang and his wife, and I admire the Chinese people. Generalissimo Chiang and his wife and their people now share the same determination to strive for freedom at any cost, and to continue the war until what the Japanese call the "China Incident," a ridiculous term, becomes the "Withdrawal from China Incident."</p>
<h3>Although Negotiations Between Japan and the Netherlands Have Broken Down, Japan's Advance Southward Is Still Pending; Batavia's Strong Stance Places Japan in a Dilemma</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th – Yoshizawa, the Japanese chief representative in the economic negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, recently stated that if the Dutch East Indies did not accept Japan's demands, they would suffer dire consequences. Now the Dutch East Indies have rejected Japan's demands, and Japan has tolerated this. Thus, the view held here that Tokyo is only waging a war of nerves, using Yoshizawa's empty threats to intimidate, has been confirmed. Those familiar with Far Eastern affairs have always felt that although the future is unknowable, at present, Japan is not yet ready to launch any military action south of Vietnam. It is generally speculated that Japan is unable to cope with serious resistance, so the southward advance may not be realized, unless Britain encounters a very significant setback, and the Axis powers can seize the final victory. The content of Japan's demands has not yet been disclosed, but it can be asserted that Japan wants to extend its economic influence in the Dutch East Indies, transplant Japanese people in large numbers, and obtain concessions to develop the natural resources of the Dutch East Indies. If the Dutch East Indies agreed to this kind of demand, then the Dutch East Indies would no longer be a Dutch colony, but a Japanese colony. It is truly puzzling how Japan could hope that the Dutch East Indies would accept such broad demands. People here compare Yoshizawa's threatening remarks of June 6 with his mild tone of yesterday and come to the conclusion that Japan is not yet ready to carry out aggressive actions overseas. Or perhaps Japan is not yet prepared, or rather, is not yet able.</p>
<p>United Press, Manila, 19th – The "Manila Bulletin," published by Americans, stated in an editorial today that the Dutch East Indies' rejection of Japan's economic demands represents a failure of the diplomatic situation in Japan's southward offensive. The newspaper said that Japan's hesitation is due to Britain's continued resistance to the Axis powers and the firm attitude shown by the United States. The newspaper stated that Batavia's tough stance has placed Japan in a dilemma.</p>
<p>TASS, Tokyo, 19th – According to a Domei News Agency correspondent in Batavia, Yoshizawa disclosed the contents of the Japanese government's instructions during his final meeting with the Dutch East Indies authorities, and presented Japan's final demands. Yoshizawa said that since the Dutch East Indies had rejected Japan's demands, there was no need to continue negotiations. The Japanese representative is scheduled to leave Batavia on the 27th. Yoshizawa now intends to meet with the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, and then jointly issue a communiqué stating that the negotiations have been terminated.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Advocates Concluding an Alliance with Thailand</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 19th – The Kokumin Shimbun recently stated that the Japanese government should take the conclusion of a military alliance with Thailand as the first step in expanding the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The newspaper said that the fate of Thailand and the security of Vietnam, and the security of the entire South China region and its nearby water sources, are all seriously affected. The newspaper further pointed out that China is carrying out economic oppression against Thailand, and its concentration of troops in Burma and south of Malaya is also intended to threaten Thailand into submission, and to eliminate this small enemy at the back door of Singapore. It also said that before Thailand is further oppressed and subdued, Japan should conclude a military alliance with Thailand. This would not only maintain Thailand's security, but also increase the security of the entire East Asia. The Hochi Shimbun quoted the remarks of Japanese parliamentarian Imai, who spoke at a Taisei Yokusankai meeting on Monday, based on a strong southern policy of the Tripartite Pact, to establish his proposed Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The newspaper also said that Imai stated that the failure of the Dutch East Indies negotiations was due to the Japanese government's lack of decisiveness, which led the Dutch East Indies to dare to despise Japan.</p>

<h3>Sassoon Arrives in England and Delivers a Speech Advocating That Democratic Countries of the World Unite to Resist Germany</h3>
<p>United Press, Los Angeles, 19th – Far Eastern financier Sir Victor Sassoon arrived here yesterday and believes that it is necessary for the democratic countries of the world – Britain, Australia, and Canada – to unite as one with the United States. Apart from this, there is no other way to stop Hitler's actions. Sassoon also said that the United States needs Britain, Australia, Canada, and other countries to purchase South America's exports. The United States itself must also help to purchase them. South America is a coalition of democracies. Sassoon also said that his remarks were made from a commercial point of view.</p>
<h3>Eden Praises Mellor's Work</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – British Foreign Secretary Eden formally praised the work of Mellor, Inspector General of the Chinese Maritime Customs Service, in the House of Commons yesterday. Answering a question from You about the customs administration rights in the occupied areas of China, Eden said that Mellor continues to administer customs affairs throughout China, including lighthouses and port affairs under joint jurisdiction, but Mellor must consider the needs of the occupying forces in the occupied areas. Conservative Member of Parliament Knox asked whether the authorities knew that Mellor was fighting for British interests single-handedly in the Far East, and whether the Foreign Secretary would provide assistance to the extent possible. Eden replied, "I will convey to him your appreciation for his work, with the utmost enthusiasm."</p>
<h3>The Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee Will Be Formally Established Soon, with Three Divisions: Secretariat, Economic Research, and Auditing; Chen Guangfu Will Serve as Chairman</h3>

<h3>The Situation in the Near East Changes Suddenly; Germany and Turkey Sign a Treaty of Friendship, Guaranteeing Mutual Respect for Territorial Integrity, Which Will Remain in Effect for Ten Years</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th – Official sources here stated that the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship was signed on the evening of the 18th by the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, on behalf of the German government, and the Turkish Foreign Minister, Saraçoğlu, on behalf of the Turkish government. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Germany and Turkey, wishing to place their relations on a basis of mutual trust and sincere friendship, have agreed to sign this treaty, under the condition of maintaining all existing treaties of both countries. The German Head of State has appointed the Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, as plenipotentiary, and the Turkish President has appointed the Foreign Minister, Saraçoğlu, as plenipotentiary, to agree on the following terms:</p>
<p>Article 1: Germany and Turkey guarantee mutual respect for territorial integrity and inviolability, and will not take any direct or indirect measures against each other.</p>
<p>Article 2: Germany and Turkey guarantee that they will conduct friendly consultations in the future regarding issues involving common interests, in order to seek understanding on how to handle these issues.</p>
<p>Article 3: This treaty will be ratified and the instruments of ratification will be exchanged immediately in Berlin. This treaty shall take effect from the date of signing and shall remain in effect for ten years. The contracting parties will, within the stipulated period, reach an understanding on the issue of extending the validity of this treaty. This treaty is written in duplicate in both German and Turkish, and signed in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, on June 18, 1941.</p>
<p>When Papen and Saraçoğlu signed the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship, they exchanged notes on the economic relations between the two countries. The original text is as follows: "Based on the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship signed today, I hereby notify Your Excellency that my government is prepared to increase the economic relations between Germany and Turkey to the maximum possible extent, and to consider the various possibilities of the economic structures of both countries, utilizing the experience gained by both countries during the war. The two governments will immediately begin negotiations to find the basis for implementing this agreed-upon treaty as soon as possible." After the treaty was signed, a joint statement was issued to the newspapers and radio stations, stating that after the plenipotentiaries of the two countries signed the Treaty of Friendship, they hoped that the texts and opinions published by the newspapers and radio stations of both countries would reflect the spirit of friendship and mutual trust in German-Turkish relations.</p>
<p>Interview with the Turkish Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 19th – The official German news agency reported that the German Ambassador to Turkey and the Turkish Foreign Minister signed the Turkish-German Treaty of Friendship at 9 p.m. last night in Turkey. Shortly afterwards, the Turkish radio station officially announced that Turkey and Germany had signed a non-aggression treaty and exchanged identical documents. At 11 p.m., the radio station suddenly stopped its normal broadcasting program and announced the contents of the Turkish-German treaty and the Turkish Foreign Minister's remarks to the press. The Foreign Minister stated, "The actual and existing obligations of both countries are not affected. Turkey and Germany have now confirmed that they will not oppose each other in any way in the future. Over the centuries, the world has changed, but Turkey and Germany have never opposed each other. Their relationship has always been clear and correct. The signing of this treaty has laid a very solid foundation for friendship." When the Turkish Foreign Minister announced the signing of this treaty, he expressed "great joy," saying that "Mr. von Papen, a friend who is familiar with our country's situation, has made special efforts to ensure that this agreement can be signed."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 19th – Political circles here believe that the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship is a natural result of the restoration of economic relations between the two countries and the repeated exchanges of notes between Hitler and the Turkish President. Political circles are very satisfied with this treaty, considering it a continuation of the traditional friendship between the two countries during World War I. However, this Treaty of Friendship does not affect the treaties concluded by Turkey with other countries. As for Germany, obtaining the friendship of Turkey is a major diplomatic victory. This also shows the far-sightedness of Turkish politicians. British people in Turkey are quite disappointed with the development of the situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 19th – According to news today, Turkey has refused to sign the Turkish-German Goodwill Agreement unless it includes clauses guaranteeing the British-Turkish treaty. Turkey's loyalty to its treaty obligations with Britain has delayed the negotiations conducted by the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, for a long time. The Turkish Foreign Minister would only sign it after the guarantee clauses were recognized.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – According to news received here today, the martial law order in Istanbul and coastal areas will continue for six months. Another message said that after Germany and Turkey signed an agreement, the section of the railway in Greece bordering Turkey would be managed by Turkey.</p>
<p>German Foreign Ministry Commentary</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th – Regarding the signing of the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship, a German Foreign Ministry spokesperson said last night that the friendship between Germany and Turkey should be traced back to the time of the World War. The depth of the friendship should not be affected by temporary misunderstandings. Kemal Atatürk, the founder of modern Turkey, advocated economic cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, when he was in power, Germany ranked first in both exports and imports to Turkey. German purchases of Turkish raw materials and agricultural products accounted for a very large percentage. The current President İsmet İnönü continues the spirit of his predecessor, establishing this treaty to further consolidate the friendship between the two countries. Germany recognizes Turkey as a stabilizing force in Southeast and the Near East, and Turkey is deeply convinced that Germany has no territorial ambitions in Turkey and the Near East. Hitler's speech on May 5 praised Turkey's peace policy, opposed British conspiracies, and since he came to power, he has worked to strengthen relations with Turkey. The Italian Prime Minister's speech on June 10 also expressed Italy's willingness to continue cooperation with Turkey on the basis of the 1928 Turkish-Italian agreement. Germany will never forget Turkey's old friendship. Germany will provide assistance when Turkey is in danger.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th – A semi-official German publication, the German Foreign Policy Correspondence, which only occasionally publishes comments on major political events, commented today on the German-Turkish Treaty of Friendship. It first reviewed the close relationship between the two countries in the past, and how Germany became Turkey's largest customer after the National Socialist Party came to power. Later, it described the recent developments, stating that Turkey had signed an agreement with Britain before the outbreak of the war, which naturally had a considerable impact on German-Turkish relations, but since Germany's military superiority increased daily, this influence disappeared. Therefore, the Ankara authorities understood Germany's invincibility and the need for Turkey to adopt a realistic policy. After Germany was forced to intervene in Britain's strategy of expanding the war in the Balkans, Turkey also deeply understood Germany's difficulties. Therefore, the attitude expressed by Turkey when British Foreign Secretary Eden and British military generals repeatedly visited Turkey was also extremely appropriate. The speed of the German army's victory in Greece was also commonly seen by Turkish soldiers. In the political sphere, Turkey found that Germany's previous promises had been fulfilled, thus laying the foundation for Turkey's future policy. This Treaty of Friendship is the external manifestation of that policy. Germany is satisfied with the intelligence relationship stipulated in the treaty.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons to Hold Secret Meeting</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – The House of Commons will soon hold a secret meeting to debate the shipping situation and the war in the Atlantic. When Prime Minister Churchill officially announced this matter today, he said that the debate on shipping should only be held in secret, because if it is discussed in public, the public interest will be seriously endangered. If the debate is held in secret, he will make a statement to the House of Commons, but it will not be made public. Labor Party Member of Parliament Shinwell and former Secretary of War Belisha both advocated for a public debate, but the Prime Minister replied that he could not.</p>
<h3>Suicide Rumors of Field Marshal List Have Been Denied by Berlin</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 19th – Authoritative sources said that foreign newspapers are rumored that Field Marshal List, commander-in-chief of the German forces in the Balkans, has committed suicide due to the failure of the German forces in Crete. This is completely unfounded. List only commands the Balkan war. German Head of State Hitler invited him to lunch together on the 16th and praised his contributions. The commander of the Battle of Crete was German Air Force General Löhr.</p>

<h3>German Troops Deploying in Finland; Britain Intercepts Three Finnish Ships; Announces Finland is Not a Genuinely Independent Country; Stops Issuing Permits for Ships Sailing to Finland</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – German troops arrived in Finland in early June in considerable numbers and deployed within Finnish territory, not merely passing through. After learning that the Finnish government had allowed German troops to pass through Finland to Norway last autumn, the British Ministry of Economic Warfare announced yesterday that it had stopped issuing naval permits for ships sailing to Finland from June 14. Since that date, three Finnish ships have been intercepted, as the British government no longer believes that the Finnish government can comply with the conditions agreed upon last year when Finnish ships had naval permits.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 19th – The Ministry of Economic Warfare announced that British troops had intercepted and detained three Finnish ships heading to Petsamo (a Finnish port on the Arctic Ocean) because Britain could no longer recognize Finland as a genuinely independent country.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 19th – Swedish Defense Minister Sköld stated in Parliament yesterday that Sweden's anti-aircraft artillery was quite weak at the outbreak of this European war, but it has now been greatly strengthened. Those who were previously prevented from enlisting will be called up for training this winter. Forty-six percent of those qualified to join the Air Force have already enlisted.</p>
<p>United Press, Capital of Sweden, 19th – Finnish newspapers yesterday heard rumors from the Finnish capital that Soviet troops were withdrawing from Hanko and other Soviet bases in Finnish territory. However, this news has not yet been confirmed. According to previous news, it was reported that after strong German forces arrived in Finland, the Soviet troops would destroy the communication lines in Karelia.</p>
<p>Rumors of German-Romanian Attack on the Soviet Union Not Credited by Britain and America</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 19th – Ankara Columbia Broadcasting System correspondent Burt said yesterday that many unfounded reports have been received from commercial broadcasting companies in Turkey, stating that Romania has issued an ultimatum to the Soviet Union to return Bessarabia, and that German troops have attacked the Soviet Union at fifteen points along the Romanian border. However, Burt said that according to what is known in Turkey, this news is not true.</p>
<p>Reuters, Manila, 19th – Unconfirmed telegrams have been received here stating, according to Turkish newspapers, that German troops have launched a fifteen-pronged attack on the Soviet Union along the eastern border, and that Romania has also issued an ultimatum to the Soviet Union demanding the return of Bessarabia.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 19th – Reliable British sources said yesterday that London had no confirmed news regarding Romania or Germany taking military action against the Soviet Union, or sending an ultimatum. It was also said that such news has been circulating since Tuesday. Most of these rumors are unfounded and originated from Ankara and Istanbul. It was also said that since these rumors have continued to circulate in the past seventeen hours and have still not been confirmed, they should absolutely not be taken seriously.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 19th – The State Department said last night that it had heard nothing about rumors that German troops had attacked the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Swiss Capital, 18th – There are many rumors circulating about German-Soviet relations. Today it was also rumored that a group of senior Soviet military officers will soon visit Berlin, but according to a Berlin correspondent for the "Basler Nachrichten," German officials have heard nothing about this.</p>

<h3>Tank Battles in the Western Desert Triangle End; Communiqué States that the Objective Has Been Achieved; British Forces Withdraw to Forward Positions</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 19th – The fierce three-day battle in the triangle between the Solum, Capuzzo, and Halfaya Pass in the Western Desert has come to an end. The communiqué stated that the British forces repelled several attacks by enemy forces. As a large enemy force attempted to encircle the British forward troops, the British forces withdrew to forward positions, but had achieved the objective of forcing the enemy to reveal its strength and inflicting heavy damage on it. Several hundred German soldiers were captured, and many enemy tanks and artillery were destroyed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 19th – It is reported that there were still fierce tank battles yesterday in the triangle east of Halfaya Pass. Military circles in Cairo said that this was a local battle.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 18th – According to news from both Italian sides, the British forces operating in North Africa have used light tanks shipped by the U.S. Army Department to Britain. These light tanks weigh 13 tons, have a speed of 40 miles per hour, are equipped with a light cannon, several machine guns, and have thick steel plates that cannot be penetrated by machine gun bullets. The United States produces 300 of these tanks per month.</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 19th – The Italian news agency reported that in the Battle of Solum, the British forces used hundreds of the latest American tanks. At the same time, Gayda said in his newspaper that the British forces used a total of two tank divisions, with a thousand tanks, and that 200 were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Turkey Still Maintains the Spirit of Friendship with England; Foreign Envoys in London Believe German-Turkish Agreement is a Major Blow to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent states that since Yugoslavia and Greece have successively been ravaged by Nazi troops, Turkey is under even greater pressure from Germany to join the Axis powers. Not only is Turkey endangered by the German occupation of Aegean islands, making it vulnerable to German attack on its weakest defensive line, but also its closest neighboring countries are, due to circumstances, unable to provide Turkey with any assistance. Turkey's source of war materials relied on France, and since France's defeat, Turkey has been greatly affected. Under these circumstances, it is no wonder that Turkey has to reach a compromise with Germany within limited bounds. Germany originally wanted to force Turkey to abolish its treaty obligations to England or to allow German troops to pass through Turkish territory, but Turkey maintained its sovereignty and remained steadfast. This is especially noteworthy. Turkey not only maintains its current status of non-involvement in the war but also, in maintaining its sovereignty and territorial integrity, expresses loyalty to the goodwill and spirit of friendship contained in the Anglo-Turkish alliance. The new German-Turkish treaty explicitly preserves Turkey's existing obligations, so it can be concluded that although Germany is trying to promote the importance of this treaty as part of a psychological war against the Soviet Union, this treaty will not destroy Turkey's friendship with England, nor will it cause Turkey to take actions that harm England. When these negotiations were underway, the British authorities were kept fully informed.</p>
<p>Eden's Position Unshaken</p>
<p>United Press, London, 10th – Foreign embassies and responsible British figures, after yesterday's study, believe the sudden German-Turkish friendship treaty is a major blow to the Soviet Union. London observers attach great importance to the tense situation between Germany and the Soviet Union. Some speculate that Hitler's delay in making formal demands on the Soviet Union is to wait until Turkey is brought to heel, weakening the friendship between the Soviet Union and Turkey. However, many British commentators insist that the new Turkish-German agreement still leaves the Anglo-Turkish alliance fully in effect, and Ankara may issue another statement confirming this. Foreign embassy officials believe that the German-Turkish agreement represents Germany gradually gaining British influence in Turkey and replacing it, effectively representing a new military situation in the eastern Mediterranean. Germany has already destroyed the Balkans and Crete and now prevents the British navy from gaining a foothold on the Turkish coast, but it is also believed that Turkey has not allowed German troops and war materials to pass through its territory. However, Germany will inevitably continue to increase its power in Turkey in the future. The impact of this treaty on Iran is also more favorable to Germany. This news has not yet been released in London last night. The agreement will not shake the position of Foreign Secretary Eden. Officials still firmly state that the ambassador to the Soviet Union, Cripps, will still return to Moscow unless Germany and the Soviet Union go to war. Even if war breaks out, if the Soviet Union expresses willingness to negotiate terms with Britain, Cripps can still return to his post.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the European War (VI)(4): The European War and American Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Will the United States participate in the European War? This is a major question of concern to people around the world. The following is a detailed record from the New York Times:</p>
<p>For more than sixteen months, the American Gallup and Princeton opinion polling organizations have continuously measured the impact of the European War on American public opinion and explored the reasons for its evolution over time.</p>
<p>The latest conclusions of the surveys are: (1) Although those who advocate that the United States should declare war on Germany and Italy are in the minority, the vast majority advocate that if there is no other way to defeat the "Axis powers," then the United States should participate in the war; (2) Support for intensifying aid to Britain is growing, and in order to make the aid to Britain policy effective, the majority also advocate implementing convoys, that is, sending warships to protect merchant ships transporting military supplies to Britain.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, although the opinions of various parties seem to contradict each other, they are not. A large part of Americans insist that Germany must be defeated, and if Britain cannot shoulder the arduous task alone, the United States should join the war. This raises a question of fact: If the United States does not participate in the war, can Britain win?</p>
<p>When Americans are directly asked whether they should go to war with Germany and Italy, only 10% give an affirmative answer. However, opinion polls vary depending on the content of the question. When they are asked about general aid to Britain, 77% advocate intensifying aid to Britain, and 62% believe that risking war to aid Britain is more important than avoiding involvement in the war. According to a report released by Gallup in early May, two-thirds of the nation believe that Colonel Lindbergh's views on the war are very different from their own, which can be seen as clear evidence.</p>
<p>Regarding the convoy issue, according to Gallup's recent report, 40% of the national total supports convoys, and 71% believe that saving Britain from defeat cannot be achieved without convoys. As for those who accept the survey, 72% support convoys.</p>
<p>Last spring, when the real war had not yet broken out, Americans believed that Britain and France did not need American assistance and could win. Then, the British and French allied forces were successively defeated in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, and the general public believed that Britain's chances of winning were slim, and the United States did not need to risk war. However, after Britain announced its continued war, the argument for supporting Britain at all costs rose again.</p>
<p>In early April this year, more than three-quarters of Americans believed that Britain could win, 5% believed that Germany could win, and the rest were ambiguous. After the British navy defeated the Italian fleet in the Mediterranean and a coup occurred in Yugoslavia, American optimism reached its peak. By early May, when Athens fell, the number of Americans who believed that Britain could still win dropped to 52%, the number who predicted Germany would win was 18%, those with undecided opinions accounted for 22%, and those who expected the war situation to be chaotic accounted for 8%.</p>
<p>However, during this period, the public did not have much disagreement with the government's policies. The number who believed that risking war to aid Britain was better than staying out of it decreased from 70% to 62%. The number who advocated going to war with Germany increased slightly, and the number who supported convoys was even greater than before. After Britain's defeat in the Balkans, the number of supporters of isolation increased by 8%, but at the same time, there was an equal increase in the number who advocated aiding Britain at all costs.</p>
<p>Americans' answers to specific questions, especially those involving complex and important events such as war, are often prone to misunderstanding. Those who insist that the United States should not be involved in the war can cite the results of opinion polls to say that only 10% of the country supports participating in the war. Those who advocate that the United States should risk war to aid Britain can also confidently say that the results of opinion polls are in their favor.</p>
<p>If we carefully analyze American public opinion, we can find that Americans are generally divided into the following five factions:</p>
<p>(1) The majority of the people believe that Britain cannot win without the United States, and the United States should help it at the cost of war, and they believe that if Germany wins, it will definitely attack the United States within ten years, control American commerce and foreign markets, deprive Americans of their freedom, and force the United States to maintain a strong national defense and spend huge national defense expenditures, plunging the people into poverty.</p>
<p>(2) About 15% of the people believe that Britain cannot win without American assistance, and the United States should help it at the cost of war, but they do not believe that Germany's victory will lead to the above-mentioned terrible consequences. Some of them are shocked by Germany's aggressive actions, some are pro-British, and some are simply irreconcilable with the aggressor.</p>
<p>(3) About 20% of the people believe that the United States should avoid involvement in the war, even if Germany wins and then attacks the United States, controls its trade, deprives it of its freedom, and reduces its standard of living, they will not change their mind. Some of them believe that Britain does not need American assistance and can win, and the United States has no reason to risk war further. Others believe that admitting Germany's victory is better than the United States getting involved in the war.</p>
<p>(4) Another 15% believe that the United States should avoid involvement in the war and believe that even if Germany wins, the United States will not be attacked, its foreign trade will not be hindered, and its general life will be as comfortable as usual. They will only support war when the United States is truly invaded or has been invaded.</p>
<p>(5) Another 3% to 10% do not have much opinion, and they do not know what their views on the war are. Most of them are not interested in the war.</p>
<p>In short, those who strongly advocate participating in the war are mostly middle or upper-class graduates of universities in the South, who are over 30 years old. Strict isolationists are mostly young women in the Midwest who have not received a university education, or men over the age of 50 who have low incomes and have not received a full education.</p>

<p>United Press, London, 19th – The leader of the British House of Lords, Lord Moyne, in replying to Lord Gort's comments on the Battle of Crete, revealed for the first time that Britain has begun to expand its mechanized divisions in a manner similar to Germany's. He said that the Germans had highly effective radio cooperation from the beginning of the war and that he believed that Britain's armored forces are now being organized in a way that closely cooperates with the air force, similar to the Germans. This function will definitely support the war of mechanized troops.</p>

<h3>Teachers and Staff of New Huan No. 2 Elementary School Request Relief</h3>
<p>(Da Hua News Agency) The teachers and staff of the private New Huan No. 2 Elementary School on Chongqing Road in this city, because the school did not issue appointment letters and refused to hold semester examinations, led to a student fight wind, school workers beating teachers and other strange things, which have been recorded in various newspapers. According to a Da Hua News Agency reporter, the teachers and staff felt compelled to leave the school yesterday and specially petitioned the educational authorities, requesting a fair arbitration and providing practical assistance and relief.</p>
<h3>Youth Association College Guidance Lecture Series - Day Four (1)</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the final day of the Youth Association's college guidance lectures. Students from Aurora University and three other schools provided introductions to their respective institutions, as follows:</p>
<p>Aurora University Overview</p>
<p>First, Aurora University student Wang Juerong introduced the general situation of the university. He mentioned that the school was founded in 1903 and has been in existence for thirty-eight years. Because it is sponsored by the Catholic Church, it possesses a unique school spirit. Most professors are priests who do not seek remuneration for teaching, their lives being maintained by the church. Therefore, their work efficiency is not affected by rising living costs. Furthermore, the school buildings are excellent, and student life is very comfortable. The dormitories, such as those for female students, have sanitary facilities in every room, which is a notable example. In addition, priests teach in French, so students' French proficiency is very high. In the past, when a certain national bank wanted to establish branches in Haiphong and Hanoi, graduates from the school, regardless of their major, were almost all hired immediately. However, the most painful thing for students is the exams, which are held once a week, from morning until night. Oral exams are especially difficult. A priest asks questions individually, and if the student cannot answer, there is silence for fifteen minutes before they can leave. At this time, the priest says "Thank you," which is extremely embarrassing. The restrictions for oral exams in major exams are even stricter to prevent favoritism due to personal feelings between teachers and students. Students call it the "Three-Court Joint Trial." In addition, if students are sick, they can be treated at the school's hospital, with medical expenses calculated at half price. Therefore, there are many people who take the Aurora University exam because they have some hidden ailment. As for the organizational structure, there are four colleges: Law, Engineering, Medicine, and Liberal Arts for Women, as well as a French language preparatory class. The Law College has two departments: Law and Political Economy, which have a considerable reputation. In addition to Chinese law, the curriculum includes comparative law. The teaching method emphasizes the use of ideal cases for students to solve independently. The college also has an independent library. The current Minister of Economic Affairs of the National Government, Weng Wenhao, and the President of the Supreme Court, Xie Guansheng, are graduates of the college. In recent years, it seems that no graduate from each class is unemployed. The Engineering College is divided into departments of Physics and Mathematics, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, and Electrical Engineering. The Medical College is divided into a general department (including internal and external medicine, a six-year program) and a Dental department (a four-year program). Most of the professors are French and Belgian and emphasize anatomy. Because they receive assistance from the French Concession Public Works Bureau, the corpses used for dissection are supplied by the [Tzu] Charity Hospital. Most of the corpses are unidentified bodies found on the streets. Furthermore, because the corpses are not living people and have many defects, the Public Works Bureau also captures live dogs on the street that have not been registered, to provide for experiments. The graduates of the college have excellent career prospects. Of the twenty-five students graduating this year, seventeen have already been hired, even though they have not yet received their degrees. Regarding the entrance examination, the Law College emphasizes Chinese and foreign languages. The Medical College tests physics, chemistry, and biology. The Chinese professors' thinking is very in line with current trends and is not old-fashioned. Essay topics are often like "My Aspirations." Brochures can be obtained from the school on Lyu Ban Road. Student extracurricular activities have become increasingly active in recent years. In addition to religious and academic groups, there is also the Aurora Drama Society, Peking Opera Society, Photography Research Society, and Friendship Association.</p>
<p>Soochow University Overview</p>
<p>Next, Soochow University student Zhang Jiazhuang introduced the general situation of the university. He mentioned that the school has a history of ninety-seven years. The school motto, "Sincerity and Benevolence," is the "school spirit." As for the organizational structure, there is a College of Arts, which has a Department of Chinese Language and Literature (Head: Xia Cheng [Kai]), a Department of English Literature (Head: Dr. C. Day), a Department of Education (Head: Tan Tiankai), a Department of Political Science (Head: Li Peien), a Department of Accounting (Head: Wang Ruilin), a Department of Management (Head: Hu Jihuan), and a Department of International Trade (Head: Kong Shi'e). The College of Engineering is divided into a Department of Chemical Engineering (Head: Dr. Zhen), a Department of Architecture (Head: Architect Wang Huabin), a Department of Civil Engineering (Head: Engineer Liao Weici), and a Department of Mechanical Engineering (temporarily not enrolling). Among the departments, the Department of Civil Engineering seems to have a slightly higher reputation. The department is divided into general, water conservancy, sanitation, construction, and transportation groups. Discipline is very strict, especially regarding leave restrictions. The vibrant state of student extracurricular activities is something to be proud of. In addition to the Youth Association, which is large in scale and extensive in its work, the other organizations are too numerous to list. The Youth Association recently held an exposition, which was greatly praised by all sectors of society. Regarding the entrance examination, Chinese is always a test of knowledge, such as correcting errors and filling in blanks, and knowledge of chinese. However, essays must be written in classical Chinese. The English test also includes correcting errors, filling in blanks, and identifying parts of speech. Those with slightly poorer entrance exam scores can be admitted as probationary students for one semester. Only those with excellent grades can formally enroll.</p>

<h3>Grains - The Rice Weevil's Ambition Is Ultimately Difficult to Quell</h3>
<p>Although New Imported Rice Arrives Continuously, Market Prices Are Still Raised by About Four Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice initially rose and then weakened, finally rising again. Prices at various levels continued to increase amidst fluctuating conditions. British-run firms bought back original packages, and customers were eager to purchase them, making the market even more active. Furthermore, the price of newly ordered rice was increased due to higher transportation costs, and those holding rice were even more eager to hoard and raise prices. However, new transactions continued uninterrupted. Yesterday, Heyi sold 500 tons of July Shangxiao Jiao at a price of 143.55 yuan, and Xinchangsheng sold 1,000 tons of Siamese Number Two at a price of 134 yuan. It is said that transportation costs have increased by 25 shillings, so the price was increased. Siamese Number Two was previously priced at only 130 yuan, but yesterday it was increased by four yuan. As a result, the price of rice bought back on the market also opened high, rising from 132 yuan to 134 yuan. Saigon Number One rose to 144 yuan, and Shangxiao Gui Lu both reached 144-5 yuan. Broken rice is currently at 114-5 yuan. Six down, seven up initially opened at 109.5 yuan, then rose to 110.05 yuan. In the afternoon, customer hoarding became increasingly active, and Shangxiao Jiao increased by another yuan to 146 yuan. Broken rice also reached 112 yuan due to eager customer hoarding, which was two to three yuan higher than the previous day. About 2,000 tons were traded. The spot market also opened with 20,000 bags, and prices had already risen by one or two yuan in the morning market. Although there were no official transactions in the afternoon market, sellers' asking prices also increased by one or two yuan. At closing, Saigon Number One was 126 yuan, then 124 yuan. Number Two was 118 yuan, then 117.5 yuan. Xiaowen Puxi Zhanshi was 120 yuan on the Puxi side and 119.5 yuan on the Pudong side. Min Dang was from 24-5 yuan, and Tokyo Jian Te was from 114 yuan, then 111 yuan, and Sui Jian was 97 yuan, then 94 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice continued to arrive. The Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's Yuansheng ship arrived in Shanghai from India via Hong Kong the day before yesterday, bringing 9,969 bags of foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council. Another 8,428 bags of foreign rice were transshipped to Tianjin. The foreign rice was unloaded at the Qichang warehouse in Pudong. The Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice on that ship was moved to the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Although the owners of thick and thin Japonica rice saw that foreign rice was soaring repeatedly and envied it, they wanted to increase prices accordingly. However, because the local stores' sales were at the time of the mildew season, they dared not stock up too much, so they were unable to do so. As a result, the selling price could barely be increased by a yuan or so. It is estimated that fresh early and late Japonica rice from Nangang opened at 135 yuan for high quality, then 133 yuan, and old rice was 121 yuan, 130 yuan. Old Japonica rice in original packages from Wuxi was 125-6 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the going rate for glutinous rice has increased more during this good season, it is ultimately not widespread because the season is already over. Therefore, it is also difficult to compare it to foreign rice. Hong Kong goods have only seen an increase of about a yuan. Round grains open at 118-9 yuan, long grains at 116-7 yuan, medium at 115 yuan, glutinous green beans at 110 yuan, then 106-7 yuan. However, when the prices of other goods have repeatedly soared in the past few weeks, this alone has remained flat, resulting in an imbalance in the current price, which feels particularly cheap and cheap. Suddenly, large customers began to absorb it, and the market underwent a rapid change, suddenly rising by as much as three yuan. High-quality goods opened at 125-6 yuan, and even lower-quality goods required 122-3 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour Rises Step by Step</p>
<p>Flour - The current foreign flour market is showing a tendency to rise step by step. This is because sales in Japan have been quite good recently, and amidst the tense international situation, there are fears that foreign flour will not continue to arrive. Furthermore, the source of domestic new wheat has been cut off, causing Eight Hearts to flourish. Many hoarders are buying, and the market is gradually rising. Jinlong flour initially rose from 31 yuan to 31.45 yuan, and then rose again to 31.8 yuan in the afternoon. Pao Tai flour rose from 32.4 yuan to 32.7 yuan. Huadao flour reached a peak of 33 yuan, rising another seven or eight cents from the previous day. Other miscellaneous brands also simultaneously increased in price. However, actual sales are not greedy and are still holding steady.</p>
<p>Wheat - There was no trading in wheat yesterday. This is because there have been many twists and turns in the arrival of new wheat in Shanghai. Even factory-handled goods are subject to the prohibition, and it is feared that they will not be able to circulate smoothly for a while, so the market remained as stagnant as usual.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains - Raw Soybean Oil Shows Hidden Strength</h3>
<p>Under the influence of nervous sentiment, prices in the miscellaneous grains market reversed from weakness to firmness across the board. Corn rose by a yuan or so in the early morning, but then fell back to its original level. Over 3,000 bags were traded. Red sorghum has already risen by two or three yuan from before, and new broad beans have also increased by more than half a yuan. Although the overall situation for soybeans showed a slight increase of two or three cents yesterday due to the unpromising cake market, it was outwardly strong but inwardly weak.

[It was] already heard that Germany and the Soviet Union had established an agreement, which was advantageous to short positions. [It was] even further spread that the Soviet Union and Germany had a conflict, and that a US-Japan compromise was a beneficial situation. However, both sides did not believe that the rumors about the Soviet Union and Germany were true, and without the amendment of the Neutrality Law, it would not be easy for the US and Japan to break apart and engage in armed conflict. However, to say that they would compromise would be an overstatement. In reality, it was because the important 5.5 yuan mark for the US dollar was not easy to break out of, and the trend turned tighter.

<h3>Gauze Flowers: Cantonese Sales See Revival, Gauze Prices Recover</h3>
<p>Starting from 1475 Yuan, Rising to 1505 Yuan</p>
<p>After fluctuating for two days, the gauze market rebounded yesterday. Hong Kong merchants actively purchased available gauze, resulting in a lively scene. Purchases amounted to 400 bales of "Shuang Ma" (Double Horse) brand. Simultaneously, the "biao jin" (premium bid) rose, boosting market confidence and prompting speculative buying. Consequently, a bullish trend emerged, with short sellers posting losses of 2.5 "jiao." The current gauze market trend appears particularly solid, largely due to tightened factory orders and rising raw material costs, coupled with sustained demand from Hong Kong. Therefore, the market's foundation is strong. However, short sellers, still concerned about the unfavorable international situation, continue to sell, leading to intense competition between the two sides. The high price for 20-count Shuang Ma gauze was 1504 yuan, and the low price was 1475 yuan. In the early afternoon, the price initially rose to 1505 yuan, then fell back to 1494 yuan. Subsequently, with the rise in the premium bid, it surged to 1504 yuan, with the final price at 1501.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Shuang Ma opened in the morning. Due to poor market sentiment in the morning and early afternoon, market conditions continued to be sluggish. The opening price was 1480 yuan. Upon this price, sellers rushed to sell, and it soon fell to 1475 yuan. However, those who profited took their gains, and it recovered to 1487-8 yuan. Penang Special (檳特) remained stable for a long time. Later, as the premium bid rose and buying interest surged, the market suddenly turned bullish, soaring to 1504 yuan at closing. Statistical reports indicate that 8,000 bales were traded during the half-day session, with 1,000 bales purchased by Hong Kong merchants and 7,000 bales by domestic traders.</p>
<p>Jin Ma (金馬) "biao sha" (纱标, Gauze Bid) Market Conditions: The market opened weakly in the morning, but turned bullish due to positive news. It continued to rise in the afternoon. The July contract rose by 6.5 yuan, and the August contract also rose by 6.5 yuan. A total of 8,250 bales were traded throughout the day. The high and low prices, as well as the closing price for the month, are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Firm</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains robust. High-quality fine short-staple cotton is scarce in the market. Therefore, although American cotton prices have weakened, market sentiment remains firm. The "pi qiu" (皮球, Ball) transactions among traders are extremely active.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Market conditions were slightly subdued due to a slight drop in American cotton prices. At the same time, due to the continued rise in the gauze market and the unfolding of favorable international circumstances, market sentiment is bullish. Although factory purchases were quiet yesterday, a small amount of Brazilian cotton was still transacted by various "hua hao" (cotton firms). Additionally, a batch of Indian cotton was shipped directly to Shanghai. The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yuan Sheng (源生) ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying 1,000 bales of cotton from Calcutta. Yesterday, it berthed at the 斯福码头 (Sifu Dock) for unloading.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Export Permits Not Yet Implemented, Dutch Sugar Price Increase Slows</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, rumors circulated that export permits for Dutch East Indies sugar would soon be implemented, causing sugar prices to tighten. However, yesterday, the Dutch East Indies representative responsible declared that the export permit system would not be implemented in the short term. Consequently, market momentum eased. Large Tianjin merchants have been actively purchasing "cu bai" (coarse white) and Dutch red sugar, reaching approximately 90,000 bales. Demand is relatively active. Public deals have been made for spot deliveries of grade 14 "cu bai" (coarse white) arriving in June at 91.5 to 92 yuan, land-borne goods at 92.2 yuan, May imports at 91 to 91.6 yuan, March imports at 88.6 yuan, and later at 89.4 to 89 yuan. Dutch red KD mark was at 71.7 to 72 yuan, NT mark at 68.5 yuan, Taikoo White B mark at the East Wharf at 106.3 to 6 yuan, DY mark at the East Wharf at 95 yuan, HX mark at the East Wharf at 90 yuan, HM mark at 75 to 76 yuan. Yesterday, 1,155 bales of refined sugar arrived from Hong Kong, and another 2,000 bales were being transshipped to Tianjin. 300 tons of Javanese refined syrup arrived.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: All Types of White Cloth Rise in Price</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was slightly firmer yesterday. Transactions of "ben ke" (local) colored cloth gradually increased. Dyeing factories are selectively purchasing grey cloth at lower prices. Crude cloth and twill, due to firm factory prices, have stable market sentiment. Cheap, readily available goods are scarce for wholesale. As a result, some white cloth, both coarse and fine twills, rose by 2.5 "jiao." Blue cloth and "bi ji" (嗶嘰) flannel rose (2.5 to 3 "jiao" per piece). Over 300 pieces of various fabrics were traded on this street. Merchants from Dinghai, Zhejiang Province, purchased 50-60 pieces of colored cloth, pongee, and crude cloth. Hong Kong merchants purchased over 200 pieces of Wah Fung blue cloth and Ta Sun colored twill, etc.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to gradually increasing demand from occupied areas and the fact that removal permits are limited to Japanese factory products, the prices of white cloth and "jiao huo" (corner goods) have risen uniformly. In particular, the rise in the price of "Si Jun Zi" (四君子, Four Gentlemen) flannel is the most pronounced. It opened in the morning at 1 yuan, 4 jiao, 9 "fen," and 2.5 "li" per yard, gradually rising to 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 2.5 "fen." At closing, it slightly retreated to 1 yuan, 5 "fen," and 2.25 "li," approximately a rise of 3 "fen" per yard. However, hoarders continue to search relentlessly, and the supply is becoming increasingly tight, indicating a potential for continued price increases. The result of this month's futures for "Long Tou" (龙头, Dragon Head) fine cloth was an increase of 7 "jiao." Spot warehouse transactions are slow, rising by 5 "jiao," with the evening closing price at 45 yuan and 2.5 "jiao."</p>
<h3>Metals: American Narrow Strip Steel, High Prices Offered</h3>
<p>The trade in 200-pound narrow strip steel is particularly active due to the adoption by cigarette factories, printing factories, toy factories, etc. in this street, and the market sentiment is also excited. In addition, the overseas supply is cut off, and the existing stock in this port is said to be very expensive. Yesterday, each box of 200 pounds of "tong hua se" (general pattern and color) was sold for 400 yuan outside the customs, and the "jian hua se" (selected pattern and color) was temporarily unavailable. It is also found that among the hardware goods in Shanghai, the stock of tinplate is the most concerning, and the American narrow strip steel is one of them. The remaining goods are also very thin.</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships Gather and Sail South, Threatening the Dutch East Indies, American Passenger Ship Sees Various Japanese Warships, Many Believe the Japanese Side Will Not Act Rashly</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' President Coolidge passenger ship arrived at the Wusongkou at 9:00 PM (Customs Clock) on the night before last, as scheduled, and berthed at Buoy No. 11 and 12 at 10:30 PM. After staying in Shanghai for 22 hours, it set sail at 5:20 PM (Summer Time) yesterday and left the Wusongkou at 7:00 PM, heading straight for Honolulu and returning to San Francisco. According to passengers on the ship, when the President Coolidge was sailing towards Shanghai on Tuesday afternoon of this week, the passengers on board looked far to the right and suddenly saw black shadows arranged neatly on the horizon, which they found very strange.</p>
<p>Many Japanese Warships Discovered at Sea</p>
<p>Then, the fog dispersed a little, and the black spots were all clear. When they fixed their eyes on it, they were all Japanese warships, including cruisers, submarines, destroyers, battleships, and aircraft carriers, all heading south. The location was relative to the coast of Xiamen, 12 miles away from the right side of the President Coolidge. The time was quite clear. Passengers gathered by the railing to watch. Without a telescope, they could distinguish the rank of each ship.</p>
<p>Pointing Out the Number of Ships, 53 Ships</p>
<p>It is said that the number of Japanese warships exceeded 100. From the President Coolidge, 50 ships were seen. Someone counted them one by one and got a total of 53 ships. Most of them seemed to be destroyers and submarines. The first to sail were four or five battleships and one aircraft carrier. Then they saw several ships on the left, sailing close to the coast, with only one giant submarine, quite close to the President Coolidge.</p>
<p>Many Believe It is Intended to Intimidate the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Some say that the southbound Japanese warships are probably due to major Japanese actions in the South Pacific. Others believe that the southbound Japanese warships are intended to intimidate the Dutch East Indies, so that they will make important concessions in the economic negotiations held near Batavia. No matter what the intention is, the passengers on the President Coolidge who were evacuated felt no joy at the sight of the southbound Japanese warships. It has been learned that the President Coolidge will be converted into an army transport ship after crossing the Pacific to return to the United States this time. Regarding the saying that a large number of Japanese warships are sailing south, the Shanghai Japanese Navy spokesman said, "There is no formal news now, so I cannot express an opinion."</p>
<p>Britain's Determination to Defend Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to the latest issue of the Millard's Review, according to the National News Agency, the Guangdong Provincial Government will evacuate overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Macau, which will be presided over by the Overseas Chinese Evacuation Committee of the Ministry of the Interior. However, there are 1.3 million Chinese in Hong Kong and 200,000 in Macau. Even if they are willing, it is quite difficult to evacuate in reality. Presumably, this news is due to the Chinese side's view that Hong Kong is under serious threat from the Japanese side. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's sole purpose was to eliminate foreign bases in China.</p>
<p>The Last Base for Foreigners in China</p>
<p>For example, the Tianjin Concession has lost its original appearance. The British concession in Weihaiwei has moved its office to a ship. Hankou has been occupied by the Japanese army, and the French concession in Hankou is also controlled by the Japanese side. The fact that the public concession in Xiamen can still be maintained today is an exception made by the Japanese side. Hong Kong has now become the last base for foreigners in China. The Japanese side will start to invade this distant Chinese colony as soon as Britain is in extreme difficulty in Europe.</p>
<p>Japan May Use Pressure for Economic Aggression</p>
<p>However, in view of Italy's failure in Europe, Japan does not seem to intend to take any action until Britain is exhausted. Moreover, the United States is also related to Hong Kong, and the Japanese soldiers seem to have to be concerned. According to Yu Hongjun, Vice Minister of Finance of China, he does not believe that Japan will invade Hong Kong militarily, but will concentrate its efforts on economic aggression. Yu's argument is very insightful.</p>
<p>Various Measures to Resist Aggression</p>
<p>Because Hong Kong has been blockaded by the Japanese army and separated from the Chinese coast, the prices of goods in Hong Kong are high and the supply is difficult. Because Hong Kong has always relied on the products of mainland China, once it is blockaded by the Japanese army, it will not be able to obtain external supplies and will become a dead market. As a result, the Japanese army will use this as a coercion to force Hong Kong to follow in the footsteps of Vietnam. Hong Kong is not only of military importance, but also the end point of Chongqing's external transportation air route and the western end point of the Pan American Airlines Pacific. Therefore, the Japanese side attaches more importance to it. However, the British have repeatedly stated that they are determined to protect Hong Kong to the end. Considering the various measures taken there recently, we should believe that the British statement is not wrong.</p>
<h3>Standard Wireless Radio Company, Materials Moved Away, One Person Arrested by the Japanese Side</h3>
<p>No. 9, Lane 142, Beidi'aos Road, French Concession, is a Hong Kong-Shanghai wireless radio warehouse, also known as Standard Wireless Radio Company. Suddenly, late last night, the Japanese Military Police Command sent military police to the French Concession Police Station and requested that Chinese and Western detectives go there together. After inspecting the warehouse, they moved away the wireless radio materials piled up in the warehouse and arrested a Chinese person stationed in the warehouse for guarding and took him away. It is said that after the incident, the Japanese military police also went to a room in a building at the intersection of Ai Duo Ya Road and Chengdu Road with the Public Concession Police Station and moved away a part of the same materials.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Labor Dispute Resolved, Business Can Be Restored in the Short Term, Laid-Off Employees Will Be Hired First, But Not Restricted by Any Treaty</h3>
<p>The labor dispute at the Commercial Press has lasted for more than two months. Through the re-mediation of Ms. Xing De of the Industrial Department of the Public Works Bureau, regarding the issuance of preferential money, the capital side only granted three months' salary, and those who did not have enough eight months' salary including discounted salary will make up eight months' salary. The labor side requested ten months' salary, including rice subsidies. Both sides adhered to their original proposals, and the mediation was on the verge of breaking down again.</p>
<p>Xing De Mediation</p>
<p>Later, Ms. Xing De determined it after several compromises on behalf of both parties. Those who did not have enough nine months' salary will make up nine months' salary, and the rice subsidy is not included. Those whose salary including discounted salary has reached nine months will be supplemented with 150 yuan. After repeated discussions by the joint committee of colleagues, in order to take care of various aspects, they unanimously decided to pass it. They reluctantly accepted the partial problem of the dismissal compensation this time. Yesterday, they also sent representatives to formally sign the contract at the Industrial Section of the Public Works Bureau. Li Bojia and Shi Jiuyun attended as representatives of the capital side. Regarding the company's need to add staff in business, the company should first hire the colleagues who were laid off this time, and the two also made verbal replies, guaranteeing that the company would first hire the old employees when the company needs employees in business, but the company is not restricted by any treaty.</p>
<p>Labor's Aftermath</p>
<p>As for the labor side, in order to urge the company to implement the promise of priority employment in the future, it was decided to organize a dismissal colleague committee to register the total number of laid-off people this time, and to add statistics and technical analysis for the company to supervise the reward when it needs to employ employees in business. As for the colleagues in service, to maintain the minimum wage rate, the two replied that the company would pay attention to the livelihood of the colleagues at any time and would give full consideration to it this time, which will be implemented soon. There is also the short-term worker issue. After the final effort, the salary was increased from one month to three months, plus discounted salary. It is said that the company will resume business in the short term after a little sorting out. The labor side will draft a report on the detailed mediation process of all industrial materials this time, which can be sent to colleagues within one or two days.</p>

<h3>Haig Garden Horticultural Show</h3>
<p>The horticultural show organized by Mrs. Mather, a British expatriate in Shanghai, was originally scheduled to be held at No. 118 Rue du Père Froc. However, due to the prohibition by the French Concession, the venue was changed to the Haig Garden on Haig Road. It was still held on time the day before yesterday. Because all the funds raised were donated to the British War Fund, people from all walks of life, especially overseas Chinese, flocked to the event and generously donated money to help it succeed. The results were very impressive. Left picture (above): The gate of the horticultural show (below): The charity bazaar scene (photo by Kang Zuyi)</p>

<p>Chongqing Mountain City, Overflowing with Vitality</p>
<p>After leaving Shanghai on April 4 this year, Huespeth sailed to Hong Kong, and then took a plane from Hong Kong to Chongqing. The plane he took was very new, so the journey was comfortable and pleasant. When he arrived in Chongqing, he got off the plane and went to the inspection room to be inspected. All inspectors were polite to foreign passengers and were considerate everywhere. Because Huespeth brought things to a friend in Chengdu, there was a slight misunderstanding during the inspection. After the explanation was clear, the doubts were dispelled, and the inspector apologized and left. Huespeth said: "If a Chinese goes to the United States, and is inspected upon arrival, I am afraid that the inspectors will not treat us with the same attitude as the Chinese inspectors." There are many mountains near Chongqing, and pedestrians mostly hire mountain sedan chairs or rickshaws, which are quite expensive, and climbing mountains and ridges is dangerous, and there is almost a feeling of getting little out of the trip. He continued to say that the first impression he got in Chongqing was "an indescribable sorrow." Some people were not fully clothed, and some were dirty and filthy. The suffering and worries they suffered were far greater than those of the people in Shanghai, but regardless of age, gender, or profession, the people all had strong perseverance and spirit, were not moved by the suffering of the war, and still worked hard for the great cause of building the country. This was the most profound impression he got.</p>
<p>Built as Soon as Destroyed, the City Appearance is Renewed</p>
<p>Chongqing has been bombed many times, so there are air raid shelters everywhere in the city. Once the alarm sounds, people flock to the shelters to hide. However, because Chongqing has a small area and a large population, the relocation work has been actively implemented recently. Although the bombing is fierce, the houses collapse, and the people suffer, but Chongqing's reconstruction work has never been affected in any way. As soon as it is built, it is destroyed, and as soon as it is destroyed, it is built, so the city appearance is still the same as before. Chongqing is an important transportation hub in the rear, and cargo transportation is concentrated here. Goods transported from Yunnan and Burma, such as gasoline, etc., are gathered here. Therefore, once an air raid occurs, the threat to the goods is extremely heavy and huge. Therefore, when an alarm sounds, a large number of workers move the goods that are being unloaded or have not been placed to a safe place. After the air raid has passed, they continue to unload or load. Although this kind of work is extremely arduous, the workers have no complaints, are courageous, have a clear consciousness, and resist the tragic encounter with an indomitable and unyielding spirit, which can shock the world and move the gods. Foreigners who witness this scene are amazed. Huespeth stayed in Chongqing for nearly a week, and then set off for Chengdu to inspect the local church affairs.</p>
<p>Chengdu Has Become a Cultural City</p>
<p>The most profound impression I got in Chengdu was the development of education in extraordinary times. There are many middle schools and universities, and there are so many students that there is almost a lack of room for them, and the general refugees, living in thatched huts and living a hard life, still have the opportunity to enjoy education. The "refugee professors" are engaged in rescue, teaching with great care and patience, and the people's wisdom is greatly opened, and the results are good. There are few air raids in Chengdu, so there are not many air raid shelters. In fact, the geology of Chengdu is solid and it is not easy to dig air raid shelters. If there are any, the cost of construction is also high. Therefore, when an air raid occurs, people mostly scatter to the countryside. The water conservancy project near Chengdu is well-developed, the ditches are vertical and horizontal, the farmland is irrigated, and the harvest is very rich, and the people's nature is calm and has not changed for a long time. Even after two thousand years, it will still be able to proceed as usual. However, the local living standard is rising day by day, and the price of goods has skyrocketed, almost ten times higher than before the war. It is not surprising that the general coolies, such as rickshaw pullers, etc., earn 12 to 15 yuan per day, and their income can almost exceed that of a high-ranking doctor, but the general company employees do not earn much, so their situation is extremely difficult, and the working masses can easily get more rewards with lighter work.</p>
<p>Kunming Shows a Brand New Appearance</p>
<p>Huespeth managed the public affairs in Chengdu for half a month, then took a plane south to Kunming. He used to work in Kunming, so he was familiar with the people and places, but in recent years, Kunming has obviously undergone major changes. The streets are wider, and the shops are full of luxury goods, which is very different from five years ago. There are also new developments in transportation. Five years ago, when Huespeth was in Kunming, there was only one railway. Now there are three more. In addition to the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the two newly added railways are the Yunnan-Burma Railway, which has only completed 12 miles, but there are two trains running every day, and the other is the Xi-Kun Railway, which is now being actively built. The construction and development of transportation have not stopped due to the war. Various industries have also made amazing progress, manufacturing various supplies with remarkable results, especially the activities of young people, which add more vitality to Kunming. Huespeth suffered two heavy bombings in Kunming, and countless civilians were killed. Some had incomplete limbs, and some were homeless. Some women were carrying babies and running and crying with another child at the same time, not knowing what to do. This tragic scene is really unbearable to look at.</p>
<p>A Street Urchin, Commendable and Weeping</p>
<p>When Huespeth was in Kunming, he met a fourteen-year-old peddler and asked about his family background. He was originally from Hankou. Three years ago, Hankou fell, and his family was destroyed. Alone, he drifted and wandered, walking thousands of miles to reach Kunming. The journey took several years, and he relied on peddling to make a living. When asked about his future, he couldn't answer and said that he would continue to wander, not knowing what home was. This story is the embodiment of the national soul of the Republic of China. China has been fighting for several years, and the people still feel optimistic, have no complaints, are determined and unwavering, and continue to move forward until thousands of years, improving today's world and pursuing a happy life. Also, according to people from Free China, although the development of the southwestern provinces after the war has not reached its peak, the rectification and improvement in this short period of time can be said to be unparalleled in the world. Especially the spirit of perseverance, the diligence of operation, the outstanding spirit, and the calm attitude give China a vigorous vitality and hope, ensuring that China will continue to survive and will always be a member of the world's democratic camp. After fighting for four years, the spirit is as strong as ever. This is really a symbol of China's invincibility and the foundation for the final victory.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise Suddenly Due to Speculation, Residents Should Not Rush to Buy, The Yang Rice Ordered by the Authorities Will Arrive in Shanghai at a Flat Price, The Reasonable Price Increase of Dang Rice is Very Small</h3>
<p>The current situation changes at any time, and the general rice merchants repeatedly spread rumors. Recently, they have been active, causing rice prices to rise step by step. The authorities of the concession are deeply afraid that various grain shops will take advantage of this opportunity to privately raise prices or hoard them for sale. Yesterday, they specially ordered the Pingmi (平米, Stabilized Rice) agency to inform the grain shops that the selling price to the retail rice shops for the small twisted rice purchased at 124.7 yuan per bag must still be 133.5 yuan and must not be arbitrarily raised. The purchased goods must be sold as much as possible and must not be hoarded. If there is any violation, once it is found out, it will be severely punished. At the same time, the Public Works Bureau has been investigating the resale of grain shops, and a standard sales form printed by the bureau can be purchased from the Liji Foreign Firm and can be sold only after approval.</p>
<p>Pre-Purchasing and Storing is Really Unwise</p>
<p>According to Pingming News Agency, a total of 166,610 bags of low-priced small twisted rice arrived last month. The first batch of 120,000 bags ordered by the Public Works Bureau from the Hong Kong Government this month has already been loaded on the Yussheng Jinan and other ships, and the remaining 70,000 bags will also arrive completely in port within days. This batch of 120,000 bags was ordered before, and the selling price is the same as before. The selling price in the market is still 110 yuan per stone. The residents of this port know that the low-priced Ming Dang rice, etc., will have price increase news, and they are pre-purchasing and storing from retail rice shops, which is really unwise. The reasonable price increase is still unavoidable, and it is also very small. Why bother yourself?</p>
<p>Attention Should be Paid to the Weight of Stabilized Rice</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the amount of Hong Kong rice sold by various rice shops has always been only 156 catties per stone, and although some rice buyers have questioned the rice shops, the rice shops always say that they are based on the usual practice and that the weight of the hemp bags must be deducted, so the citizens do not doubt it. According to the announcement of the English Association of Rice Shops, it proves that 160 market catties is the full net number. The excuses of the rice shops such as hemp bags are completely deceiving customers. In the future, the Hong Kong rice sold by the rice shops should be sold at the full number. However, it seems necessary to thoroughly investigate those who have been deducted in the past. It is hoped that the Concession will deal with it severely, and the Rice Shops Association should also review it and not allow any leniency, and value the people's food.</p>
<h3>Central Government Allocates Funds for Disaster Relief in Eastern Zhejiang War Zone, Totaling 900,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The recent war in Eastern Zhejiang has expanded to over ten counties. Before the war, there was a shortage of food and the livelihood of civilians was very difficult. The outbreak of war has caused widespread destruction, displacement of people, and numerous disasters. It has been learned that the Central Relief Committee has allocated 700,000 yuan to actively assist the affected people, which will be distributed by the Zhejiang Provincial Relief Office. Furthermore, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in addition to the previously allocated funds for relief, has additionally allocated 200,000 yuan to jointly provide relief with the central government's funds. This substantial amount of 900,000 yuan has been distributed to commissioners in various districts for collection and proper distribution, providing relief to each household.</p>
<h3>United States Eagerly Donates to Aid China</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Guatemala have already remitted donations to the New York office of the United China Relief Association. Since the efforts of Chairman Soong Tzu-wen and Secretary-General Cheng Chia-yi, overseas Chinese organizations and leaders from the United States and the Americas have successively joined and supported the association. Currently, the association has organized over 200 branches throughout the United States, and the committee members appointed by the Chinese Committee are distributed across major cities in the Americas. Fundraising is already underway, and the generous donations and enthusiastic assistance from overseas Chinese are particularly gratifying. It is reported that donations are exceptionally active everywhere. Even overseas Chinese in Guatemala, South America, have already remitted donations, making the fundraising prospects very promising.</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of Shao Xubai's Death; Memorial Ceremony Held Today</h3>
<p>Today marks the first anniversary of the death of Mr. Shao Xubai, former president of the Dagu News Agency, who was assassinated on July 1st last year (May 26th of the lunar calendar). To commemorate Mr. Shao's immortal spirit, his friends and family have specially organized a memorial ceremony today at the Qingliang Temple on Metter Road.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Returns to Shanghai from Southwest China, Expresses Satisfaction After Inspection</h3>
<p>Mr. Steele, a Far East correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, recently visited and inspected various parts of Southwest China. He has now returned to Shanghai via the Burma Road. During his trip, Mr. Steele conducted a detailed inspection of the construction situation in China's rear areas and expressed great satisfaction. He is scheduled to give a lecture at the American University Club in Shanghai next Tuesday, detailing the vibrant situation in China's rear areas and describing the transportation conditions on the Burma Road.</p>

<h3>Korean Gangs Cracked Down On For Extorting Entertainment Venues; Demanded Huge Protection Fees Based on Tier; Gang Members Active Throughout Shanghai; Police Conduct Extensive Investigation and Arrest of Fugitive Gang Members</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reports that several Koreans were extorting "protection fees" from theaters in Shanghai. The incident occurred and was discovered; detectives from the Old Zhabei Police Station made arrests. It is reported that these Koreans will be handed over to the Japanese authorities for further interrogation on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Extortion</p>
<p>The case originated when theater managers received twenty-two threatening letters demanding "protection fees": 300 yuan per day for first-run theaters, 200 yuan per day for second-run theaters, and 100 yuan per day for third-run theaters. Failure to comply would result in bomb attacks. On Sunday, police officers from the Old Zhabei Police Station, posing as representatives from the Great Shanghai Theatre, went to Pudong to pay the "protection fee." They collaborated with Japanese military police to arrest three extortionists and took them back to the police station. One of the suspects has confessed to writing more than half of the threatening letters and participating in the first bombing of the Great Shanghai Theatre.</p>
<p>Case Cracked</p>
<p>The suspect also confessed that the extortion gang he belonged to was organized by rogue Koreans who specialized in extorting "protection fees" from entertainment venues such as taverns, theaters, coffee shops, and dance halls. They collected payments at the end of the month, reaping substantial profits. Gang members were scattered throughout Shanghai, operating everywhere, causing entertainment venue operators to worry about their safety. Inevitably, they had to allocate a portion of their income to pay the extortion gang. It is reported that the gang's methods were modeled after American extortionists. Police authorities stated that they are conducting an extensive investigation, and it is hoped that the remaining fugitives will also be apprehended.</p>
<h3>Dai Chunfeng of Funing's Calligraphy Fans</h3>
<p>Dai Chunfeng of Funing is proficient in both Chinese and French literature and has lived in Shanghai for nearly forty years. His students are all outstanding talents of their time. Although he currently holds important positions such as the secretary of the Shanghai New Medicine Association and is extremely busy, he still devotes his spare time to studying classics and researching the "Six Principles" of calligraphy. He is deeply knowledgeable in the seal scripts from the Three Dynasties, Qin, and Han periods, such as those found on pottery, seals, ancient scripts, tripods, sacrificial vessels, and currency. He can be considered a worthy successor to Wu Dacheng. In 1920, his works were exhibited at the Belgian Exposition, where he received a gold medal, demonstrating that his calligraphy is not only highly regarded in China but also esteemed in foreign lands. He has now established a price list for selling calligraphy on fans, limited to 200 pieces. Yesterday, at the Dou Ji store in Jiuhuatang, I saw ten different fan designs written by him. The grandeur of their style and the boldness of their power are reminiscent of the Jin and Wei dynasties, directly tracing back to the Qin and Han periods, capturing the spirit of the Three Dynasties. There is also a unique collection of ancient seal characters forming a poem, which is truly a rare and divine work. Those who admire Mr. Dai's calligraphy should not miss this opportunity and can find it at major fan and stationery stores.</p>
<h3>Sister and Brother Disappear, Turns Out They Were Abducted; Yao Azhang Arrested and Reveals the Truth; The Whereabouts of the Sister and Brother are Still Unknown</h3>
<p>Yao Laoda, a native of Dachang, residing at No. 8, Lane 411, Xinzha Road, works as a warehouse keeper in a rice shop. He has a son named A Jin, seven years old, and a daughter, A Er, sixteen years old. Yao is very frugal and has accumulated some savings, which his distant cousin, Yao Azhang, covets. Yao Azhang often borrowed money from Yao Laoda. Recently, he resented not being given more, and on May 17th, at 9:00 AM, A Er and A Jin, the sister and brother,</p>
<p>Suddenly Disappeared</p>
<p>Between then and July 9th, threatening letters were written and delivered to Yao Laoda, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. Someone was sent to a vacant lot at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Daxi Road to negotiate the payment. Upon arrival, no one showed up for negotiation. Subsequently, Yao Laoda was notified by telephone that if he paid at least 1,500 yuan, his daughter A Er and son A Jin would be returned. The person said his life was in danger and asked Yao Laoda to write a reply, leaving the address as before at the</p>
<p>Vacant Lot on Yidingpan Road</p>
<p>in a hole in the wall at the intersection of Daxi Road. Yao Laoda knew that this was the work of his cousin Yao Azhang. He gave 500 yuan, hoping that his children would be sent home. However, until 11:40 AM on the 17th of this month, Yao Azhang was apprehended at No. 338, North Jiangxi Road by Chinese detective Li Zunzhi from the Hongkou Police Station. He was taken to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the case, stating that the missing daughter, Yao A Er, and son, Yao A Jin,</p>
<p>Could Not Be Found</p>
<p>He requested an extension for further investigation. According to the victim Yao Laoda, when he returned home from the rice shop that day, his daughter A Er and son A Jin were already gone, and Yao Azhang had stolen a gold bracelet and 40 yuan in legal tender. When questioned, the defendant confessed that because the plaintiff, Yao Laoda, refused to provide financial assistance, at the instigation of his fugitive friends Wang Xu and others, the sister and brother, A Er and A Jin, were taken by Wang Xu and others to the residence of a woman named Lu Zhu at No. 62, Lane 519, Hart Road. Later, he heard that they were</p>
<p>Hidden in Pudong</p>
<p>somewhere. He stated that the abduction of A Er and A Jin was instigated by his friends Wang Zikang and Xu Wenzhong, who accompanied him to Yao Laoda's house on the day of the abduction. He claimed that he did not know the whereabouts of A Er and A Jin, who were hidden in Pudong. He admitted to stealing the gold jewelry and legal tender. Judge Zhong Qing ordered him to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>A Female Guide's Perilous Encounter: An Attempted Robbery and Murder in a Hotel</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, an attempted robbery and murder occurred in the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. A male guest attempted to rob a female guide of her valuables and attacked her with a hammer. Police detectives rushed to the scene after receiving a report and arrested the suspect. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Men Rent a Room, Call a Guide</p>
<p>Su Huili, a 19-year-old Cantonese woman residing at No. 342, North Shaanxi Road, works as a guide at the Lotus Guide Agency in a pavilion at No. 25, Shantou Road to make a living. She goes by the name Lin Xinghua. At 10:30 PM the previous night, a guest named Chen Ziliang, staying in Room 142 of the Oriental Hotel, called Lin and asked her to accompany him. The woman put on heavy makeup and went to the hotel. Upon entering the room, she saw two guests, one in Zhongshan attire and the other in Western attire. They immediately began to flirt and joke.</p>
<p>Sudden Evil Intent, Robbery and Murder</p>
<p>Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the two guests suddenly had malicious intent and attempted to seize the woman's watch, gold ring, and other jewelry. When the woman resisted and cried out, the two men, fearing exposure, took out a hammer that they had hidden in the room and struck her three times in the back of the head. The woman screamed in pain, and the tea server, hearing the commotion, quickly called the police, who rushed in, rescued the woman, and arrested the two suspects. The woman was immediately taken to Renji Hospital for treatment and was fortunately not seriously injured. She was soon discharged from the hospital.</p>
<h3>Quarantine Certificates for Passengers Traveling South</h3>
<p>Shipping companies such as China Merchant Steam Navigation, Jardine Matheson, and Butterfield &amp; Swire have issued a notice to passengers stating that the vaccination and quarantine certificates required for passengers traveling south must be issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department or the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Office to be valid. The aforementioned certificates must also include a photograph of the passenger and must be completed fourteen days before departure; otherwise, they will not be accepted.</p>

<h3>Believe It or Not: The Art of Borrowing Money</h3>
<p>— Ge Liang</p>
<p>It is said that there is an art to borrowing money.</p>
<p>Many people are forced to borrow money, but they often return empty-handed. The reason is a lack of the art of borrowing money.</p>
<p>When you enter someone's living room wearing shabby clothes, you first give them a bad impression. Add to that your anxious and worried face, which further disappoints them. Even if you flatter them in every way, even if you suppress your own thoughts and agree with their opinions, as soon as you mention your financial difficulties, the other party preemptively starts to pour out their own grievances to you and eloquently expresses their complaints. This leaves you unable to speak. Alas, having come sincerely from afar, you end up being rebuffed. This is not understanding the art of borrowing money.</p>
<p>To borrow money, you must first prepare a set of fancy clothes. Even if you cannot afford to buy them, you can borrow a set. If possible, rent a black-plated car and park it in front of their house. Honk the horn three times, and when the host rushes out to greet you, you should greet them with a beaming smile. (Sometimes, you should also bring a substantial gift, because you need bait to catch fish.) In conversation, you must greatly exaggerate how well you are doing recently (even if you have been without food for three days, you can only keep it to yourself). You might even say, "How have you been, old friend? If you need my help, I can easily spare ten thousand or five thousand." After some lofty talk, you can then say that banks and pawnshops have been inconvenient lately and ask to borrow a hundred or five hundred from them. Ha! The result is satisfactory, and the other party generously gives you the money without hesitation.</p>
<p>I have used theoretical research six hundred and seven times to understand the principles of the art of borrowing. Because they see that you are poor, they worry that you will not repay the money, so when you appear wealthy, they think there is something to gain.</p>
<p>So I started experimenting and testing it fifteen and a half times. (The half time was when I visited but they were not home.)</p>
<p>The result is that those who are happy to lend you money sincerely offer it to you even before you open your mouth. Otherwise… Otherwise, well… Otherwise, it is all in vain.</p>
<h3>Appreciation of Masterful Ink Paintings</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Wen Zhengzhong of the Ming Dynasty wrote to Tang Yin, "I have read a painting album of twenty frames, all imitating the works of various masters of the Tang and Song dynasties. Some are elegant, some are bold, each extremely exquisite, truly a grand compilation of painting skills. I cherish it so much that I cannot bear to put it down. Like Mi Dian, who kept strange stones in his sleeves, what is that compared to the hills and valleys in these paintings, which allow one to travel endlessly in the mind?" I feel the same about Xie Zixian's painting album. Xie Zi has recently abandoned worldly affairs and devoted himself to painting, and his art has become more refined and transcendent, almost surpassing the masters of old. He is full of creativity and refuses to be confined by conventional rules and old drafts. Whenever he creates something, he puts the hills and valleys in his heart into the hills and valleys under his brush. Thus, the smoke and clouds under his brush and the traces on the paper converge their spirit and essence in a small space, and those who obtain them treasure them like a precious jade. Whenever Xie Zi creates a piece that satisfies him, he often takes a photo to preserve his inspiration and produces collotype prints, totaling twenty frames, which are divided into paperback and hardcover editions. The collection includes figures, ladies, Buddhist images, landscapes, poetic scenes, and stories. The conch shell sanctuary, in particular, embodies the vastness of Sumeru in a mustard seed, amazing the viewers and praising its ingenious structure. It truly embodies the transformation of ink and brush to achieve a single, profound taste. (Note: Xie Zian's painting album is available at the Shanghai Science Instrument Museum and the World Book Company.)</p>
<h3>In Sickness</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>In these times, the unlucky just keep getting unluckier: it's hard enough to get a full meal, and now I'm sick!</p>
<p>The first day was quite enjoyable. I didn't have to work, and food was brought right to my mouth—very pleasant.</p>
<p>After two days, it wasn't so good anymore! I was sleeping with a dizzy head, and the food had turned into porridge (because I was sick), and having it brought to my mouth had turned into me having to "open my noble mouth" myself, which made me a little anxious.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, the situation was even worse, and I seemed to be turning into a "ghost." I suggested taking medicine, but I almost got slapped before I could finish the sentence!</p>
<p>From then on, I kept my eyes closed and my mouth shut, daring not to make a sound.</p>
<p>After all, "Heaven never bars all roads," and after lying down for several days, I actually "sat up cured." I guess either my "ancestors" came to save me, or the white blood cells in my stomach hadn't all died yet…</p>
<p>Thinking about it carefully, it's both funny and sad!</p>
<h3>Quick Sketches</h3>
<p>— Yao Yao</p>
<p>At the entrance of a small alley, a man was tightening his belt.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, sneaking around?" It turned out to be a police officer.</p>
<p>The man turned around and smiled bitterly: "Officer, I'm eating!"</p>
<p>In front of a movie theater, people were crowded like a tide, all vying to buy tickets.</p>
<p>"We really look like commoners抢 rice during a famine, haha!" a young man said.</p>
<p>"But they are doing it for their stomachs, and we are doing it for our eyes," another young man replied.</p>
<p>Several people laughed.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(9) A Strange Farmer</p>
<p>"If I don't go this time, I'm afraid there won't be another chance!" He sat wearily back down on the dirt bed, but his mind was still racing. "If I could get Xiangqi away before the nanny's family goes back, and the three of us, husband, wife, and daughter, could quietly move out of the Li family's manor and settle down somewhere else, how perfect would that be?"</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he almost laughed out loud.</p>
<p>When he put his head on the pillow, he had finally decided to leave the next day, although there were still many difficult problems blocking him, problems that he couldn't solve on his own!</p>
<p>"Unless I can find Yu Kun unexpectedly." A lucky thought suddenly occurred to him. But in reality, Yu Kun had been missing since his visit two years ago. Because that fellow had always had such a stubborn temper, he would rather die than pick up a pen to write a letter, so it was unlikely that Begonia would be able to find him.</p>
<p>Begonia himself didn't know how he got through this night. One thought after another kept his mind from having even half a minute of peace. It was as if he were staring wide-eyed at the kerosene lamp, but in his mind, he seemed to be seeing many dreams. He seemed to see Luo Xiangqi already dead, dead even before Yuan Baofan's downfall. He also seemed to see Yu Kun fighting with Yuan Laoqi. A moment later, Zhao Si's short, stout figure appeared, as if holding the now worthless bankbook and crying loudly at the entrance of the Dongxing Colonial Bank. Then, he seemed to dream that Xiao Meibao had been abducted by Mr. and Mrs. Wang…</p>
<p>"Heavens! Why is this night so long?" Before five o'clock, he cursed as he quietly got up.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Xiao Meibao was still sleeping soundly. (137)</p>
<h3>A Dinner Party: Delicacies are Hard to Swallow; Poverty is Already in the Bag</h3>
<p>— Zhong Wenling</p>
<p>When the assistant manager of the firm delicately inquired about my opinion, asking if I would be willing to participate in the Sunday noon dinner party, I really felt a little flattered; because generally speaking, the director and senior staff are the ones he invites. Regarding this exception, I blurted out "Okay", but then I thought, he was talking about a dinner party, not a treat, so everyone would have to take out some money. In a little hesitation, he seemed to detect my thoughts: "This time we ordered a table of dishes for eighty yuan, each person will only need to take out about ten yuan." I couldn't let him suspect that I was greedy for money, so I pretended to be cheerful: "Decided to go!"</p>
<p>At the banquet: exquisite dishes were placed in exquisite utensils, it was laughable that a dish of fried shrimp was served in a plate surrounded by small red and blue lamp-like decorations. Everyone ate and praised, the good sounds never ceasing. Finally, the bill came, and when the words one hundred and eighty yuan were announced from the manager's mouth, it was as if I had been hit on the head, and I was dizzy for several minutes, I suddenly felt I had been deceived, they were all big liars, the manager had cheated me ten yuan, and the hotel owner had also cheated me ten yuan. I thought if I hadn't had two drinks earlier, my face would have been very ugly. I had been intending to buy a fifteen-dollar Science For Citizens book, and had patrolled in front of the store many times, observed in the window many times, and stroked and flipped through it in the bookstore, but I always couldn't bear to buy it. But now I'd rather go, in short, I felt I had been greatly deceived.</p>
<p>But the worst was still to come. After paying the bill, they still didn't run away, lying on the sofa, closing their eyes, picking their teeth, chatting about this and that, still saying how delicious the dishes were. Suddenly, the assistant manager suggested: "How about going straight to another round?" Director Wang was the first to agree: "A complete series." The rest echoed in unison: "I agree!" They meant another round at night, but I didn't respond, I was thinking of an excuse not to participate, stomach ache? Do I have it? But when their eyes fell on me, I couldn't bear to show weakness and angrily cried out: "I agree!" These two words sounded very lonely and out of place at that time, like the cry of a wild beast forced to make a sound, miserable and ear-piercing.</p>
<p>Again at the banquet, exquisite dishes were placed in exquisite utensils, this time I didn't have the politeness of noon, I thought I had to eat enough to get my money's worth, I desperately stuffed my stomach. But for some reason, it had no taste at all.</p>
<p>That night, insomnia, I couldn't sleep no matter what. I don't know if it had anything to do with being too full. I jumped up in the morning, washed my face, and immediately ran to the bookstore to buy the beloved book.</p>
<h3>Anyway, Anyway</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>

<h3>First Hearing Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia</h3>
<p>— Gu Mei</p>
<p>The Carlton has newly invited the sisters Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia from Beiping. Yesterday was their first day on stage in Shanghai. The performance included Dongxia in "The Three Trials of Su San" and Dongming in "The Empty City Stratagem." Before the main acts, there was the martial arts actor Wang Zhongchen in "Huai'an Prefecture." The performance started at eight o'clock, already in the middle of "Huai'an Prefecture," so Jiang Yunxia's "Mu Kezhai" was missed. "Huai'an Prefecture" is the story of Huang Tianba leading his troops to capture Cai Tianhua. Although it's one of the "Eight Great Captures" in the north, it's rarely performed by southern martial arts actors. Wang Zhongchen's performance was different from the northern version. In the north, Huang Tianba is the protagonist, but Wang Zhongchen played He Renjie himself, completely in the southern style, with nimble movements and impressive martial skills, but unfortunately, he lacked a good voice. Cai Tianhua was played by Ma Chunfu, who was too old to be effective. Li Chunli, Li Yongli, Wang Yongli, and Wang Yonghe were all masters of this type of role, but no talented successors have emerged. After "Huai'an Prefecture," there was a ten-minute break, followed by "The Three Trials of Su San." Zhou Weijun played Wang Jinlong, Li Lifu played Liu Bingyi, and Li Hansan played the court physician. Among them, Zhou Weijun was the most villainous. Li Xin's chariot seemed too young, and Li Hansan had nothing commendable. Xu Dongxia's facial expressions as Su San showed great skill, and her stage presence was very steady and practiced. Her stage style was slightly lacking in length, her face somewhat resembled Yao Shuijuan, and her voice was very high and bright. Her vocal styling mostly followed Cheng Yanqiu, and she could sing very well, just like Hu Suxian's niece, Hu Jufen, a few years ago. She is indeed a strong rival for Hou Yulan. Judging from the audience's footwork entering the venue yesterday, her basic skills are very good, and she must have a solid foundation in female warrior roles, which Hou Yulan lacks. At ten o'clock, "The Empty City Stratagem" began. Ma Su was played by the golden cast's painted-face actor Li Kechang, presumably borrowed from Sun Lanting by Zhou Yihua. Li Kechang usually plays Sima Yi in the golden cast, while Gao Youchang often uses Cheng Shaoyu. Yesterday's performance was surprisingly captivating and paired much better with Yan Jupeng's Ma Liankun. The scout and the old soldier were played by Guan Dayuan and Guan Shengxi's younger brother, Guan Shengji. I have seen this person at the Gengxin Theater. According to Li Yiche, Shengji's clown roles are all learned from Xiao Ershun (Changhua), and his "Assassinating Tang," "Escorting," "Playing Music," and "Heroes' Gathering" are not inferior to Ru Fuhui. Later, I saw him paired with Huang Duqiu, and it was indeed very satisfying. This time, the scout felt frivolous, and the old soldier seemed too stiff, as if he was not the Guan Shengji from last year. Wang Ping was Zhang Yueting from the original Carlton cast. His movements and fighting were quite skilled. His spoken lines and expressions showed skill. Yan Jupeng sang "The Empty City Stratagem" several times, with Wang Ping always playing him. Xu Dongming's Old Prime Minister Zhuge Liang completely shed the feminine habits of female actors. Not using makeup makes her the first person besides Xiao Dong. Her voice is high and bright, her middle range is smooth, and her lower range is wide. Her natural talent is even better than Xiao Dong's. Because Xiao Dong still has a feminine voice, but Dongming's voice is completely not like that of a female actor. Her performance is deeply influenced by the Ma school of opera, because she specializes in it. Although she sings in the Tan style, she inevitably has Ma school movements, so she feels less steady. Her singing and spoken lines show great skill, but the "I am viewing the mountain scenery from the city tower..." section of the Er Liu tune was sung too elaborately, completely unlike the other sections. The spirit and momentum in the "Chopping Ma Su" scene were far inferior to Xiao Dong, but much more skilled than Zhang Wenjuan and Jiang Muping. Yesterday, Dongming seemed weak because she seemed too concerned about her status everywhere, so she felt too stable and not surprising. However, among female actors singing "The Empty City Stratagem," no one else can achieve the same results as Xu Dongming besides Meng Xiaodong.</p>
<h3>Ouyang Yuqian: New Script</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since arriving in Hong Kong from Guilin, Ouyang Yuqian has been engaged in writing a Ningying film script. It is said that he has completed a social tragedy based on Shanghai's life as the background. The title has not been finalized, and after modification, it will be handed over to the Guolian Film Company for production. Guolian and Ouyang maintain a very deep friendship. Chen Yunshang's previous film "Mulan Joins the Army" was also written by Ouyang.</p>
<h3>Yan Hua and Zhou Xuan: Negotiations Break Down</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>The news of Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua's marital discord was reported in detail yesterday. This is indeed an unfortunate event. If both parties had not gone to extremes in the past, it would not have caused such tragic consequences.</p>
<p>Normally, we would hope that a mediator could persuade both parties to understand each other and reconcile, but news has come that Zhou Xuan and Yan Hua's negotiations at the home of Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guohua Film Company, have broken down.</p>
<p>According to what the reporter has learned, the situation is as follows: after they met, they began to talk:</p>
<p>Yan: "Why do you want to divorce me?"</p>
<p>Zhou: "Why do you hit me and scold me? Do you know my mental anguish? Rather than suffer, it's better to divorce."</p>
<p>Yan: "I didn't hit you or scold you that much!"</p>
<p>Zhou: "When you hit me, you threw chairs around. You were practically trying to kill me. I've had enough. You said in the newspaper that I ran away with money, but I didn't run away. I took the bankbook, but I didn't go to withdraw any money. Besides, those bankbooks were all earned with my blood and sweat. They are my own things."</p>
<p>At this point, Yan Hua suddenly left without saying goodbye, so Liu Zhonghao was unable to mediate, and the situation finally became more serious and broke down.</p>
<p>In this matter, Yan Hua seems to be responsible because Yan Hua's groundless suspicion has caused him to oppress Zhou Xuan, which is well known to people in the industry. Zhou Xuan once wrote a letter to Liu Zhonghao, saying: "I have now made up my mind. I feel that I can no longer get along with Yan Hua. I think his temper is difficult to change, and it will definitely be very painful in the future. Originally, I thought of only dying, but then I remembered what the people in the police station told me last time: suicide is not as good as fighting. Why commit suicide? (Note: Zhou Xuan attempted suicide once last year due to a quarrel with Yan Hua.) So I think the only thing to do is to divorce him. If you two still want to force me to reconcile with him, then I would rather die. It's just that he often loses his temper and scolds me. I really can't stand it." At the same time, Zhou Xuan said in a letter to Yan Hua's lawyer: "Mr. Yan is cold and ruthless, and his temper is particularly irritable. In the family, a disagreement immediately leads to violence.</p>
<p>Xuan, with her weak nature, driven by hunger and cold, is engaged in the hard work of the film industry all day long. She already feels very tired. Mr. Yan not only does not show any tenderness, but often exerts his authority. Xuan, unable to bear the abuse, once attempted suicide and was rescued..." This shows Zhou Xuan's inner pain.</p>
<p>Now that the two parties have broken down, they will probably have to resort to legal means to resolve the issue. Zhou Xuan has hired three lawyers, Jiang Baoli, Jiang Pingfan, and Li Weibin, and published a notice in this newspaper. After that, a divorce tragedy will inevitably be created, which is truly an unfortunate page in film history!</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) Yesterday, Han Fei said: "I got the leading role in 'A Soul-Stirring Night' through Miss Zhou Xuan's introduction. Of course, I am very grateful for Miss Zhou's enthusiastic support. And Miss Zhou, in addition to appreciating my acting skills, has no other intentions at all. But, because of her appreciation and my gratitude, we purely have a friendly relationship. She often comes to see me perform in dramas; I originally admired her very much, and I considered it a great honor for her to visit, so I welcomed her. At the time, I thought it was a trivial matter because everyone welcomes big stars enthusiastically. Unexpectedly, it caused Mr. Yan's misunderstanding. He personally brought up the matter of Miss Zhou to me. I repeatedly declared my attitude to him and guaranteed it with my personality..."</p>

<h3>After Viewing "Orphan Island Spring and Autumn"</h3>
<p>— Liu Chen</p>
<p>On the eve of a dark period, some works reflecting life and thought are prone to producing sentimental works due to the infection of the environment and the suffocation of the author's point of view. If this work does not contain rich real-life themes and positive educational significance, its impact will drag people's emotions into the quagmire of negativity.</p>
<p>Therefore, we see that the fighting attitude adopted by world artists such as Gogol and Molière towards their works, the satirical themes they extracted, and how cleverly they used lighthearted methods are worthy of future generations to learn. Moreover, this type of work does indeed have a wide audience.</p>
<p>The achievements shown in "Street Angel" and "Crossroads" in the past are a clear example. In recent years, Wu Cun's works, from a production point of view, such as "New Hell" and "Black Heaven," are similar to this type. Especially his recently released "Orphan Island Spring and Autumn" further illustrates Wu Cun's intention in directing techniques, which is to educate a more backward and larger group of people through comedy forms.</p>
<p>"Orphan Island Spring and Autumn" is a depiction of some life stories in Shanghai, exposing the living interests of several ordinary petty bourgeois classes. We see countless people living a drunken and dreamlike life in a miserable circle, but outside of life, there are still some ideals. These ideals change their views on people's life, social struggles, and contributions to the world—they are taken to a land of freedom and happiness by ideals.</p>
<p>Shanghai people see a Shanghai life comedy, which is a good education. Those who accept the education given by this comedy must first reform their own living attitudes and then further reform this rotten and smelly part of the world.</p>
<h3>Bloody Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Valiant Appearance Comes for a Fierce Battle</p>
<p>Wang Yongtai and Xu Jing led their troops in pursuit to the riverbank and saw that Liu Tiye had already retreated. Firstly, their own troops were too small, and secondly, they were not cavalry. Without ships, it was inconvenient to cross the river to pursue, so they set up five camps on the riverbank and sent people to report to Zhou Yuji for instructions. Zhou Yuji originally wanted to come and meet them, but upon hearing that Wang and Xu had defeated the bandits, he was naturally happy. He then added two hundred infantrymen and ordered Wang Yongtai to guard the ferry crossing to prevent the bandits from crossing secretly. He himself returned to the city to raise food and weapons, preparing for defense matters. He was also afraid that his old mother and wife in Ningwu would worry upon hearing the news, so he sent an official to deliver letters back, reporting the victory and telling his wife, Madam Liu, to comfort the family and not to worry. He also feared that Wang Yongtai might be negligent, so he sent ten scouts to constantly relay messages and connect information. Wang Yongtai kept the cavalry on the riverbank, carefully observing the north bank of the Xiaolong River ahead for any traces of the enemy, but it was quiet and no one was to be seen. For three consecutive days, there was little movement. Xu Jing said to Wang Yongtai, "The bandits' large-scale invasion of Daizhou this time is intended to spy on the capital. Although they suffered a setback the day before yesterday, I don't think they will retreat and admit defeat. Now that there is no movement, perhaps they have some trick, and we must be careful." Wang Yongtai said, "Nephew, you are right. At Chenjia Ferry on the upper reaches of this Xiaolong River, the water is shallower, and perhaps they may want to cross secretly there. But this place is the main road, and I cannot leave easily. It would be better to ask you to lead two hundred cavalrymen to station there to prevent the bandits from crossing secretly." Xu Jing said, "I will do my best." He then led two hundred cavalrymen away. After another day, there was still no sign of the bandits taking any action. Wang Yongtai secretly sent people to cross the river to inquire. They returned and reported that Li Zicheng was leading a large group of bandits in Xinzhou, diligently drilling, and there was no sign of any bandit activity along the way. Wang Yongtai felt relieved upon hearing this report, thinking that the bandits were afraid of the government troops and would only dare to invade again after sufficient preparation, so the vigilance was inevitably relaxed.
