<p>重慶　外交部長宣言、德義兩國政府、竟已承認南京組織、是其侵略政策、顯推及遠東、且又充份證明納粹德國與法西斯義大利已與侵略中國者同惡相濟、該兩國政府明知南京組織為日本一手造成、乃竟加以承認、實爲加於中國之重大侮辱、且不惜自棄其所享中國政府與人民之一切友誼、軸心國家、此舉愈足證實世界侵略之惡勢力、已結成集團、專事摧毀人類自山與文明、幸愛好和平與自由之國家、對於此種世界惡勢力、英勇而堅毅之抵抗、在數量上實力上、已日益增加、其合作亦趨密切、中國在此反侵略集團中、對其所處地位及貢獻、允其處此空前困難時期、對於維持國際信義一貫之努力、均堪無　、今後尤必與各友邦盡量合作、繼續奮門、以期終達吾人共同之使命、中國政府對於任何國家、　認南京組織之舉、一再聲明態度、茲特正式宣告、中國與德義二國、斷絕外交關係、中華民國三十年七月二日、</p>
<p>重慶　外交部情報司長邵毓麟、於二日晚八時邀集在渝中外各報記者、宣讀郭外長對德義政府承認南京組織之正式宣言、邵氏於宣讀完畢後稱、對於德義承認南京組織事中國政府之熊度已盡於郭外長之宣言、余不欲並不必另加評論、至於此項宣、業由外交部照送駐渝德義大使館、由該部特派凌其翰秘書持往、並携有各該使館人員離境護照此項照會、係面遞於德使館秘書諾爾德義代辦師秉乃禮、並告以中國政府於該兩使館撤退事宜、決予以一切可能之便利、至撤退路綫似將由中國政府護送至桂越邊境、外交部同時已通知衛戍總司令部及重慶市政府、加派憲警、於該兩使館撤退前、予以切實保護、關於一般德義僑民、亦已通令各地當局、予以保護、對我國在德義使館人員、外交部已電令撤退、至在德義我國僑民問題、外交部正與　委會及敎育部治商中、（二日電）</p>
<p>重慶　中國木日正式與德義兩國斷絕外交關係、要求此間之軸心國外交代表、從速離渝、並指責軸心將　侵略政策推至遠柬、外交部官員凌其翰、今日下午八時至德意大使館、遞交新任外長郭泰祺所發之文告、斷絕外交關係、此間德意大使館之職員、已接獲彼等之外交護照、並獲得安全通行至廣西越南邊界處之保證、（二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　軸心國承認在精衛之南京政權後、中國政府本日已將與德意兩國完全斷絕關係、將受絕交之影響之外交家、爲中國駐德大使陳介、駐意代辦徐道鄰、德駐華代辦柏拉森、及意大使館參事嘉羅、陳介於一九三九年向希特勒呈遞國書後、即一向駐在柏林、中國駐意大使劉文島、已於一九三八年回華、德國則自一九三八年自漢召回其前任駐華大使陶德曼後、即並未續派大使駐華、意大利駐華大使達里安尼、並未曾向重慶政府呈遞國書、（二日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶　德義兩國承認南京組織、中國政府已接駐柏林大使館報告、一俟接到正式文件內容、外交部卽將發表聲明、政府方而對此事本身、並不重視、蓋此僅爲中日戰事中一枝節問題、惟穗　出此不友好之舉動、中國政府自不能不能有所表示、據外交界某耆宿觀察、中國勢將與德義斷絕外交關係、　並信德義之承認、必有交換條件、換言之、卽日本目下應允助德攻蘇、惟某消息靈通者則謂、此舉公有促進作用、若謂日本卽將攻蘇、尙有過早之嫌、緣德義之承認南京、早有成約、徒以日本本身遲之甚久、始予承認、故德義初亦拖延、今日木旣決定培植寗方、如貸款三萬萬日金類、爰乃要求德義履行宿的、德義對口亦存有某種希望、故促成此舉、但此事演變之結果、日本自不能不爲德義而有所舉動云、又據某軍事機關所所接情報、日本自海南島之運輸艦及在台灣之海軍、均已北調、並將放棄在華中華南之若干據點、彼等深信日本之攻蘇、已迫在眉睫（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>重慶　關於德義承認南京組織問題、外交部聲明須至午夜始可頒布、據聞共譴責德義之措詞、極為嚴厲，惟將來實際步驟、因歐戰開始後、華僑　　德義者多頗有顧慮、但外部已有電令致駐柏林大使及羅馬代辦、着令率同全體使領館員、立卽撤退、同時並禁止海通社稿在此　行（一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　副國務卿威爾斯、昨晚在此間宜稱、軸心國承認南京之事、將不致影響美國之政策、美國此後仍將繼續承認重慶爲中國唯一合法政府、此間有種種表示、證明美國對軸心國此舉、不加置理、惟認此爲軸心國拉攏日本、繼續與軸心維持友好關係而已、觀察家相信、軸心國於此際承認在精衛、足以反映軸心國深恐日本之親軸心國心理正呈動搖、遂決定就可能範圍內、以外交方式相助日木「維持立塲」、（二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務幫辦韋爾士、昨晚聲明德義之正式承認南京、不使美國對中國與對日本之關係稍有變更、（　日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　據此間外交界人士談稱、軸心國此次同時承認南京、意在加强日本親德份子之勢力、俾實行助德對蘇作戰、實際上不過「神經戰」而已、相信美國遠東政策決不變更、且絕無承認南京之　云、（一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本動向的剖析</h3>
<p>蘇德戰事發生後，首先反映到遠東的一幕，便是中國與德義邦交之陷於難以維持，這在國際分野日見顯明並且軸心國家亟謀獲取外援之際，本屬無足驚異；在此以外，其在表面上尙無動靜，而內裏則在極端焦慮中有所醖釀者，則無過於今日之日本。</p>
<p>專就遠東一隅而論，日本確似具有若干主動作用，但在更廣泛的國際大避之中，却只有被動，其對外關係的動進退。因之幾年來日本的政治家和外交家只有一幕幕的跟在國際政治發展的後面，竭力追逐，及至經過若干運用和努力之後，甫將有所收獲，國際形勢早已另有變化，結果一切都又需要重新攷慮。三數年來，此種情形，一見之於遣派寺內大角赴歐準備強化三國公約，再見之於去秋三國同盟的締結，三見之於不久以前蘇日中立協定的簽訂，都是不只未獲預定步驟之效，反而引起無數新的困惑和紛擾，最近荷印談判失敗後，次一步驟尙在躊躇之中，而蘇德之間突又發生出人意外的戰事，這一情況，即在日人自身亦不諱言其為極艱困的艱關。</p>
<p>南進北守政策，本為此度歐戰發生後日本急進份子的一貫主張；不過在事實上，南進憶因準備不足放過了去夏的良機，北守復一再蹉跎，直到四月間的松岡訪歐纔獲得對蘇中立的保障。然而蘇日締約一舉，主要仍出於蘇方策動，當日本方沾沾自喜認為可以放手南過之際，蘇德戰事機隊已有百分八十的成熟，希特勒只待希臘攫歸囊括即將大舉攻蘇，而日本却對蘇保證蘇聯對第三國發生戰事時的保持中立。三國同盟與中立協定條文上的衝突從彼時業已存在，只是到蘇德實際爆發戰爭之後纔感到為問題而已。</p>
<p>但此際納粹局所計並不在此等往事恩怨，而只顧目前的實利，其最近對日本的舉措顯在讓步示惠，藉謀結歡，俾使日本供其驅策，以收夾擊蘇聯之效。在日本，最近固然北進呼聲復熾，反美易為反蘇，假使蘇軍不幸而竟對德敗北，必不免重演出兵西比利亞的一幕。更何況其對蘇戒備從未鬆馳，戰略上的北進配置亦早已完成，隨時可以發動，一切都較南進攻美更形便利。但是日本目前處境，却不容不對此更作進一步的考慮。第一，近頃國際形勢的發展，幾乎全出日當局所能把握的範圍外，蘇德開戰後，日方聚訟盈庭，討論至於旬日，乃始有所決定，却仍只模稜觀望，且內閣改組之說，又見喧囂，足徵其當局困惑的程度殆蘇德締結不侵協定時相髣髴，在這樣情勢下是無法採取斷然行動的。第二，一個國家，在一個期間之內只能有一個確定的基本國策，如果不斷動搖，反覆更張，則必致使人民感到無所適從，因而大為消減其實行的力量，其年餘之不斷動搖於侵華與南進北進之間，適足使其對於任何一個目標都無法完成。第三，最近日德之間的關係，已遠不如前此某一時期之融洽，在德軍迅速進展之下，其是否竟會發展到遠東，適為日方極感苦慮的問題，對蘇簽約一舉，固含有若干對德仳離的意味在內，而一味追隨着他國的政策，近又深為若干日人所詬病。第四，就遠東形勢來看：日本四面皆敵，只有北面的對蘇關係稍形緩和，如其眞竟又化友為敵，則如其不能在其他方面獲得和平共處的保障，勢必陷入四面敵對勢力的重圍，而最近國際間關於遠東局勢的發展，已使日本對民治國家的妥協較前益無可能。第五，日本此後的外交政策，大有重新朝向英美的趨勢，不過當前此日本挾三國同盟及中立協定以威脅英美之際，且不能引起英美綏靖政策的復活，則值此英美對納粹較前更無所畏怯之際，對日自無輕假以辭色之必要。根據這幾點的分析，可見日本的北進意念縱已復形張熾，却因於種種現實條件，無法轉側，如果軸心自身無力在對蘇戰爭中取勝，其所望於日本者亦必落空。但倘若其眞竟為納粹利誘所動，冒昧北進圖逞，則其遭遇可料必難免重蹈一九一九年出兵東部西北利亞的覆轍，但是由於今日情況與廿二年前逈乎不同，其失敗的程序又必非那一役所可比擬。</p>

<h3>美作家胡爾夫過滬　談德蘇作戰因素　希特勒努力於摧毀蘇聯　但德軍實力已日趨荏弱　德蘇雙方軍力相等明斯克戰事重要</h3>
<p>美國名作家胡爾夫（Henry　C．Wolfe）、最近來滬、盤桓的一週後、將南行赴香港與荷印、進行特殊新聞工作、胡氏曾於上决世界大戰後遊歐考察、對於德蘇事件、頗有硏究</p>
<p>納粹攻蘇最大理由於</p>
<p>昨（二日）晨、胡氏晤記者談稱、納粹進攻蘇聯之最大理由、厥爲使蘇聯不復成希特勒後方之軍事强國、從蘇聯獲取原料、尙屬决要問題、德蘇戰事對於日後發展、影響重大、希特勒之主要努力、在於集中摧毀蘇聯、俾能對英甚至對美在大西洋中進行更有效之戰事、</p>
<p>歐陸兩雄不能並立</p>
<p>同時、有一因素不應忽視者、即「蘇聯非爲他人、實爲本身而戰」、是也、歐陸面積、不足容納兩大軍事帝國主義如德蘇兩國、故希特勒之主要目的、乃在擊敗蘇聯、庶無後顧之憂、據胡氏之意、希特勒明瞭此乃曠日持久之戰爭、或將冉賡續五年以至十載、故有摧毀蘇聯之必要、而後能移其全部注意力於大西洋</p>
<p>蘇聯初望戰事稍緩</p>
<p>希特勒縱不對蘇作戰、亦能從蘇聯獲取其必要之接濟品、史丹林殆願盡其所能、接濟德國、希望戰爭遲復一年爆發、則在此時期內、蘇方可更臻强盛、</p>
<p>以士兵言實力相等</p>
<p>德國則因對英作戰而益趨荏弱、以士兵言、德蘇雙方相等、皆甚優良、以配備言、德方較勝、德軍官則遠非蘇軍官所及、史丹林淸黨時、蘇聯軍事人材、曾受損折、</p>
<p>公路暢達有利德軍</p>
<p>蘇軍弱點、厥爲軍官缺乏作戰所必要之悠久愼密訓練、而蘇軍參謀工作、亦尙不能與德軍者相比擬、蘇方已從明斯克起造一完善之軍用公路、通達莫斯科、現德軍旣陷明斯克、其機械化部隊可善用此公路、</p>
<p>胡氏預言先後實現</p>
<p>按胡氏關於歐洲之著作、行銷極廣、一九三九年六月、胡氏曾撰文預料蘇德將妥協、兩月後果有互不侵犯條的之簽訂、本年四月份、胡氏又撰文預料德蘇將起戰事、果吿實現、</p>
<h3>太平洋颶風　將襲上海　現向西北方面進行中</h3>
<p>太平洋颶風、因向西北進行、殊有襲搫中國南部海面趨勢、茲此颶風、果於前日、在香港以西登陸、惟颶風登陸後、風力即趨削弱、昨晚已完全消減、惟太平洋上繼續又發生一颶風、據大通社記者昨晨向徐家匯天文台探悉、繼起新颶風、現扺北緯十三度、東經一百三十四度之處、中心在一百二十海哩以內、風向西北、或西北偏西進行、現雖距滬遼遠、如方向循是進行不變、又將襲搫中國南部海面、至本埠天氣、連日極爲酷熱、溫度升至九十度以上、全市如沸、因之眞性霍亂、已有發現、居民對於預防、不容忽視、以免傳染、而策健康、</p>
<h3>法蘇斷絕外交關係　本巿可無反響　法蘇僑民不致發生磨擦　蘇聯總會現仍在法租界</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、昨日（一日）盛傳維希政府對莫斯科斷絕外交關係之結果、木市法租界當局對界內蘇僑團體與定期刊物、將有所行動、此等謠諑、未經法官方證實、</p>
<p>蘇聯總會迄未遷出</p>
<p>法總領署某要員講、此種問題概歸警務處辦理、法警務處發言人則稱、渠未知有取此行動之可能、蘇方半官人士謂、彼等已聞法當局或將囑福煦路蘇聯總會遷出法租界之謠諑、但迄未接此命令云、法負責要津稱、對於蘇聯僑民若取仟何行動、或將先施諸蘇聯總會、與蘇僑各定期刊物云、</p>
<p>新出刋物禁止發售</p>
<p>關於後者、近有一事可爲佐證、即紀述協的軍戰况之畫文雜誌Argus上週創刋、被禁在法租界出售是、法警務處發此禁令、並未說明理由、又英僑日前擬在法租界舉行義賣會、募款充實英國戰爭基金、忽遭禁止、乃改在公共租界舉行、法方消息靈通人士、承認蘇法政府絕交、本市有起反響可能、但稱、據渠之意、常局不致准許此種反饗發生、</p>
<p>保障秩序和平相處</p>
<p>如一九三九年九月、法英對德宣戰後、法租界當局對界內德僑或德僑團體、並未採取行動、爲保障此幽際都市之和平與秩序起見、法當局對蘇僑、當不致有何行動、蓋法蘇兩國目下和平相處、今後或亦然也、蘇聯總會與本市少數蘇僑刊物、問題極小、不必採取行動、致激起法租界蘇僑之反對、</p>
<h3>兩載米輪　延期到滬</h3>
<p>太平洋颶風自進撲華南海面後、航輪多受影饗、衛利韓公司代理之法商貨輸萬侖納號、原定一日由越到滬、茲已展期、的今明日抵埠、預定停靠羅斯福碼頭、載來食米四七、〇〇〇包、叉挪威貨輪格蘭號、亦延誤二日、改於五日或六日由仰光西貢香港等埠駛抵木埠，運來貢米二七、一五〇包、將停泊浦東起卸、</p>

<p>魯根勃滋貨輪來華</p>
<p>美國航務當局、以目下商船需要甚殷、除一面趕築新輪外、一面復徵調美國郵船公司總統輪七艘、達七八萬噸之譜、但美郵公司爲確保遠東貨運、防免因船隻被徵、影饗貿易計、乃呈請美海部、另撥美十大輪航公司之一之魯根勃滋（Luckiubach）航業公司輪船數艘、改航遠東、其中桃洛賽魯根勃滋（Duroth　Luckinbach）及海萊魯根勃滋（Hary　Luckinbach）兩艘、已先後抵華、該兩輪各凈重六千五百三十三噸、載重一萬三千噸、長四百七十三呎、較總統輪爲長、輪以載貨爲主、僅有客房四間、</p>

<h3>從香港到內地　——香港通訊——</h3>
<p>香港自中日作戰以來，因各處口岸均遭封鎖，所以很久以來，便成為連絡內地和海外的連接點，從國內到海外，從海外到國內，都必須經過香港，即是從上海轉入川桂一帶，取道香港，也是較便利的一條路。</p>
<p>以前從香港去內地的路很多，現在遂漸减少，已只賸了搭船去仰光再搭滇緬路，和去廣州灣轉鬱林柳州這兩條了。從仰光轉搭緬滇路是較爲方便的一條，不過費用頗大；到廣州灣再轉鬱林柳州這一條比較難走，但費用却省多了。</p>
<p>從香港開往廣州灣的船，經常開行的，只有「大寳石」號一艘，但從廣州灣開澳門的却很有幾隻，所以放客如不及等待「大寳石」號，可先去澳門，再由於澳轉廣州灣。因爲從香港到廣州灣，只得「大寳石」號一船航行，所以客位很擠，票價很貴，即買統艙，最少也要港幣十元。</p>
<p>到廣州灣後，因公路破壞了的緣故，從廣州灣到鬱林一段的有四百二十里路，無車可搭，只有步行或坐轎。這一段路，普通人大的都分五天走，第一天走一百一十甲路到靡江，第二天走九十里路到石角，第三天走六十里路到良田，第四天走七十里路到陸川，第五天走九十里便到鬱林。這一路，如完全坐轎，大的需轎資一百五十元。若分段僱轎則每天也需三十元上下。</p>
<p>到了鬱林，便可乘汽車直達柳州，票價約九十餘元，約兩天可到，但不是一定每天有車。除去直接坐車而外，從鬱林先乘車往貴縣，然後再搭船到桂平，由於桂平再搭車往柳州也可以，這樣比較說來，用度要省一些；大的從鬱林搭車往貴縣的需三十五元，從貴縣到桂平的三兀上下，再從桂平搭車經石龍而達柳州，票價計共十五元七角。共只需五十元上下，較直達車便宜多了。</p>
<p>全路之中，只有從廉江到石角一段，因中途須經過鷄籠山，不甚平靜外，其他各處治安均極妥當，沒有什麽危險。只廉江到石角一段，近因來往的人多了，且有些小心的旅客又常常在動身之時，聘請幾位軍警界人，作爲保鏢，較前也平安多了。</p>

<h3>糧食　米停巿一日　開巿微漲</h3>
<p>米市自一日爲銀錢業半年結賬期、市塲亦循例休業一天、咋日已照常開市營業、觀夫趨勢、尙未脫盤旋狀態，當早晨開市時、因存多到湧、買氣不旺、而公倉定米撥歸公賣者均將接連到申、公賣貢米及六月份定貨亦將絡繹來申、浮多散囤頗有隨市吐出、因此期現各米售價均見疲落、繼因本客趁平吸收、本街以連日休假、需胃尙濃、而客幫如內地寗波尤見活潑、市乃逐步上展、各米售價均由低而漲、結果一部份較前日收價漲數角至一角、一部份尙無軒輊、英華司二號暹邏米較見挺秀、價開一百四十一元至一百四十一元三角、小絞自一百四十六元至一百四十八元、碎貢米一百十二元半至一百十四元、成交一千二百噸、現米二萬包、計一號西貢一百二十七元半至一百二十五元、二號一百二十一元至一百十九元、碎米九十六元至九十四元、特別暹邏一號一百三十一元至一百二十八元、二號一百二十一元至一百十九元、米茶一百十一元、砶米一百十五元、小絞一百二十二元半至一百二十元、敏黨一百三十元至一百二十六元半、東京砶尖一百十五元、碎尖九十五元五角至九十四元五角、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、因時將小暑節令、內地存底日稀、抵埠不多、貨主心思較堅、所以本鄕店胃猶覺不爽、多屬零星、市面未見榮辱、仍開南港新鮮特早稻百三十七元、大市百三十六元、中關百三十四元半、無錫原包宿粳高自百三十一元、次至百二十六七元、</p>

<h3>經濟叢談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳</p>
<p>經濟（四）</p>
<p>日本之以Economics譯爲經濟學，嚴幾道（復）於譯亞丹斯密「原富」Wealth　of　Nation譯事例言中，已論其不當，蓋嚴氏之意，應以計學名。日人所譯之經濟學也。其言曰：</p>
<p>「計學，西名葉科諾密Economics，本希臘語。葉科（Eco）此言家，諾密（Nomics）爲聶摩之轉，（按聶摩爲拉丁文，意謂管理也）此言計言治，其義始於治家。引而申之，爲凡料量經紀撙節出納之事，擴而充之，爲邦國天下生食爲用之經，蓋其訓之所苞至衆。故日木譯之以經濟，中國譯之以理財。顧必求胞合，則經濟旣嫌太廓，而理財又爲過陋。自我作故，乃以計學當之。雖計之爲義，不止於地官之所掌，平準之所書。然考往籍，會計計相計偕（按皆見於史記）諸語與常俗國計家計之稱，似與希臘之聶摩較為有台，故原富者，計學之書也。」</p>
<p>余於嚴氏「經濟旣嫌太廓理財又爲過陿，」二語深表同意。計學二字，謂可當於目前所謂經濟學，雖從西文字源而來，余亦未敢苟同。</p>
<p>自經濟兩字流行，今竟成爲一般口頭禪，不論其爲菜也，飯也，紙也，筆也，甚至於形形色色，亦不論其爲可通與不可通，學者與非學者，動輒好稱經濟。大抵通常語中之經濟，其意義不外乎所費少而收效大，或則有合理使用之意義存焉；此與舊時所謂經紀　字倒相暗合。蓋經紀二字本爲經理綱紀之意。其後用之於經營方面，稱行商爲行紀，目有行紀之稱，遂稱經商人家爲經紀　家，又因經商人家之成家立業，大都從勤儉經營而來，故交稱人之勤儉而善運用其財者爲經紀，轉輾沿用，與時人所謂經　者固無一致。及交易所與，稱買賣居間者爲經紀人，　其與舊時行紀同以居問收佣　業務也。</p>
<p>由是觀之，今通俗所謂之經濟，殆即舊時之所謂經紀；　中國所謂經濟，其涵義又非今之所謂Economics所可比。然旣已習焉不察，則亦從其行用之便而亦經濟之也。（完）</p>

<h3>表史妹戀愛</h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>前幾天各報都刊載了一段短短的社會新聞，說有一對表兄妹發生戀愛，因爲不忍離別，相的服毒，結果雙雙殞命。</p>
<p>事實大槪沒有那樣簡單，然而這一類的悲劇，在中國已經是司空見慣，不足爲異的了。</p>
<p>一般人都有一個共通的概念，以爲像表兄妹這樣的近親，不應結婚，因爲近親結婚會生出白痴或精神有缺憾的後裔：這一對表兄妹的殉情，無疑地跟這種思想也有相當的關係。</p>
<p>然而根據最近遺傳學家硏究的結果，證明這個槪念並不完全正確，據美國哈佛大學伊斯特敎授的調查，祖宗健全的表兄妹結婚，其產生精神不健全的子女的冒險性並不比普通的婚姻大。即使生育了不健全的子女，也不是由表兄妹結婚所造成的，而是因爲上代本來有不健全的遺傳，在表兄妹的婚姻中暴露出來而已。近親結婚能把祖傳的弱點保存在家族裹，同時也能把優點保存下來。古時埃及的法志，印加斯，多南美斯，以及歐洲的皇窒，都實行近親結婚，可是結果却產生了一部份偉大的天才。德國音樂家巴哈的家庭，在五代之中，產生了二十八位特出的音樂家，這大部份是表兄妹結婚的結果，他們把音樂的天才保存在家裏了。所以遺傳優良的表兄妹，根據遺傳學上說，是可以結婚的，至於遺傳不良的表兄妹結婚，的確有增重子女精神缺憾的可能性。</p>
<p>我們並沒有提倡表兄妹結婚或近親結婚的意思，不過是指出一點科學上的新事實，證明遺傳健全的表兄妹結婚是無害的，是無須加以反對或阻止的。</p>
<p>至於爲了戀愛或結婚而服毒，是靑年的一種幼稚的舉動，這是屬於思想上與敎育上的問題了。</p>

<h3>黃霉時節細菌飛</h3>
<p>— 平</p>
<p>「黄梅時節家家雨，熟梅天氣半晴雲。」在這一時期中，江南每一個人，都曾感覺到煩悶，而允其覺得可厭的，就是一切物件上不論是帽子，鞋子，或是餅乾匣內，甚至是書架上的書籍，都會發見一塊塊天鵝絨似的東西，俗稱霉。其實牠並不是霉，不過是一種下等殖物，學名叫做黴茵；牠是乘着在這黄梅時節，潮濕的環境下，在你所有的各種物質上，大舉地移民了。</p>
<p>對於這種美麗的菌兒——黴菌——我們祗能埋怨自己的這副眼睛，不能看出牠的眞面目來；不過那些在實騐室中的科學家們，却早已在顯微鏡下，細細地觀察過了。據說這種黴菌是由十幾個細胞組織成的微生物，牠們有柳絲般的身體，一條條分枝，一枝枝分開，身上還披着絲絨似的東西，這就成了黴菌。</p>
<p>菌是植物界中屬於眞菌植物門，牠們靠着胞子來傳代，這種胞子不是兩性交配後的結果，而直接是由母體分裂的一部分。在公園裹，你也許有機會採到一棵羊齒植物，翻開牠的葉背，就可看見葉背包着一球球小米似的東西，用手輕輕一彈，牠們就會飛散得無影無踪。而黴菌的胞子，也是如此，牠們離開了母體，在空中飄浮，結果選定了你的帽子，鞋子，來充他們的殖民地。</p>
<p>胞子在殖民地上，乘着這黄梅時節，水分多，可以充分供給他們的養料，日光少，不會破壞牠們的身體，於是胞子漸漸生長，到某一時期又分裂成新體，這樣的繁殖不絕，就形成了一塊塊天鵝絨似的東西</p>
<p>要阻止　菌的繁殖寄生，第一要空氣乾燥，因為稀少的水分，可使牠們無法維持生命；第二要日光充足，大概在攝氏七十度左右，牠們就無法生存。總之：祇要多曬太陽光，　菌自然地會消滅的。</p>

<h3>護航新戰艦</h3>

<p>英國海軍當局根據秘密情報，知道德國又有六百隻新潛艇參加大西洋之戰。但英國已有恃無恐。因爲她正在趕造大批堅固的小型戰艦，專門用來護航，對付潛艇的。這批小型戰艦，曾經精密設計，抵得住大西洋的在風暴雨，驚濤駭浪。</p>
<p>小型戰艦簡單而堅固，建造起來容易又迅速，而造價僅及驅逐艦的十分之一。艦身的裝配沒有絲毫的浪費處，雖一零件之微，也必有其用每艦水手五六十人已足。艦的長度的當驅逐艦的一半，排水量四百噸，每小時速度廿至廿五海里</p>
<p>小型戰艦雖然磯位較少，速度較慢，裝甲較薄，但造價也便宜許多。一隻驅逐艦的造價，差不多可造十二隻小型戰艦呢。而量的問題在護航和對付潛艇上是非常重要的。</p>

<h3>凍睡替代麻醉劑</h3>
<p>— 潔泉</p>
<p>紐約世界博覽會，曾經表演過『凍睡』的奇事：一個少女穿了單薄的內衣，臥在滿盛冰塊的箱子裏面，漸漸地失去知覺，好像已經凍死一樣，隔了一會，人們把冰塊移去，那少女便慢慢地蘇醒了。</p>
<p>美國哈佛犬學的動物舉敎授派克（G．H．Parker）博士，最近曾在科學雜誌發表一文，主張外科醫生們在實施手術之時，應該利用凍睡的方法來替代麻藥，使病人失去知覺。因爲，他說使用麻醉劑使病人昏眠，往往容易損害病人的神經，至於利用凍睡的方法，非但可以避免上述的缺點，並且對於病人頗有裨益。</p>
<p>據派克博士宣稱，凍睡方法，久已應用於哈佛的實騐室了，他會將各種獸類加以試騐。覺得此法亦可施行於人類身上。病人的身體用冰袋和皮圈等圍住，冰水在其中環流，醫師使病人體溫逐漸降低，直至共進入假死狀態之時，乃施用刀刲，等到手術完畢，再慢慢地使病人身體溫煖。</p>
<p>派克博士又說，凍睡對於毒瘤，亦有相當的治療力量，所以，割治毒瘤之時，允應以凍睡方法去替代麻醉劑。病人經過凍睡以後，身體也決不致感覺絲毫不適‘並且，有若干人士，試行了相當時間的凍睡以後，健康反見進步呢。</p>

<p>最近海上各戲院中之武生以大舞臺與共舞臺的人才最整齊，更新天蟾决之，卡爾登尤决之。黄金僅一武旦閻世善，極爲走紅，小三麻子擅演關羽戲，武生雖有一二，都是三路角兒，無籍藉名。但武生有長靠與短打之別；像從前的何月山李春來輩，皆擅於短打戲；長靠固能，然爲欲顯短打之特長，故多不願常露演，以失盛譽。今之蓋叫天亦短打武生中首屈一指，其演「惡虎村」一齣，可稱無與倫比；祇白玉崑往年演此劇，尙能與蓋相頡頏。現蓋四年事已老，復因病不克出演，玉崑則飄泊潦倒，尤大非昔比。至於兼擅長靠武生，當推楊小樓尙和玉輩，今之李萬春李小春，（據聞小春秋凉後有入天蟾之說）及楊瑞亭白玉崑等皆傑出人才。（現時白楊兩伶均垂老未如前之可觀矣）。時至今日，武生行中，類多以短打見長但是凡爲武生之伶人，苟非具有特殊之技藝，即不爲人所推重，不然，也很難有一席地位。茲就目前本市各舞臺之武生負有聲譽的，逐一寫出，想亦爲一般愛好戲劇者所願聞的吧！不過其中或有遺漏，在所難免。此外，上海戲劇學校每屆假座黄金公演日戲，有念多位年僅十餘齡之稚童，擅長武生劇，短打靠把，無所不精，藝甚可觀；均屬可造之村，前途正未可量！以姓名未能憶及從略，但也値得介紹於讀者之前，特附筆於此。</p>
<p>王英武　他初到上海是和高慶奎偕來，搭演天蟾，懸掛二牌，風頭之健，有壓倒高伶之勢，亦可謂王最紅之時期。迨後因常與異性熱絡，藝有退步，而無進境，纔一蹶不振，今雖在卡雨登爲基本演員，但回首前塵，諒不無有感。然而其　事，確不含糊，可以看得過去，比以卡爾登新聘東霞東明兩坤伶爲臺柱，以戲碼關係，他的戲是並不每夜出演的。</p>
<p>李仲林　昔名小小桂元之李仲林，自張翼鵬輟演大舞臺而由其接替「西遊記」中之孫行者，繼演「神怪劍俠傳」直到現在，盛名未嘗稍衰。按李藝事，本具有一番苦功，兼之在哈爾濱遼寗各埠，溜過數載，益見進境，今則益見神出入化之妙，面貌雖不甚揚，但身長鶴立，有玉樹臨風之槪，是以對武劇中一切動作，自當便捷，活潑靈動；此乃其占優勢之一大原由，亦爲其他武生所望塵莫及者「紫竹林」「殺四門」「林冲夜奔」諸劇，確有百觀不厭，然如演長靠各戲，扮相難看，則不敢恭維。</p>

<h3>Declaration of Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi: China Severing Diplomatic Relations with Germany and Italy; Striving to Uphold International Integrity within the Anti-Aggression Bloc; Henceforth, Utmost Cooperation with Allied Nations to Continue the Struggle</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Declaration by the Foreign Minister: The governments of Germany and Italy have actually recognized the Nanjing organization. This is an obvious extension of their policy of aggression to the Far East and also fully proves that Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy have joined forces with those who are aggressing against China. The governments of the two countries, knowing full well that the Nanjing organization was created single-handedly by Japan, have actually recognized it. This is a great insult to China and they do not hesitate to abandon all the friendship they enjoyed with the Chinese government and people. This move by the Axis powers further confirms that the evil forces of world aggression have formed a bloc dedicated to destroying human freedom and civilization. Fortunately, countries that love peace and freedom are increasing in number and strength in their heroic and steadfast resistance to this evil force in the world, and their cooperation is becoming closer. China, within this anti-aggression bloc, can be worthy of its position and contribution. Even in this unprecedented difficult time, our consistent efforts to maintain international integrity are beyond reproach. Henceforth, we must cooperate with all friendly countries as much as possible to continue the struggle, so as to eventually achieve our common mission. The Chinese government has repeatedly stated its attitude towards any country recognizing the Nanjing organization. Now, we officially declare that China is severing diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy. July 2, the thirtieth year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Chongqing - Shao Yulin, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, invited reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers in Chongqing at 8:00 PM on the 2nd to read Foreign Minister Guo's official declaration regarding the German and Italian governments' recognition of the Nanjing organization. After reading the declaration, Shao stated that the Chinese government's attitude towards the German and Italian recognition of the Nanjing organization has been fully expressed in Foreign Minister Guo's declaration, and he does not wish to and does not need to add any further comments. As for this declaration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent it to the German and Italian embassies in Chongqing, specifically appointing Secretary Ling Qihan of the ministry to deliver it, carrying passports for the departure of personnel from those embassies. This note was delivered in person to Mr. Nolde, the secretary of the German embassy, and Mr. Shi Bingnai, the acting representative of Italy, informing them that the Chinese government has decided to provide all possible convenience for the evacuation of the two embassies. The evacuation route seems to be escorted by the Chinese government to the Guangxi-Vietnam border. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also notified the Garrison Headquarters and the Chongqing Municipal Government to dispatch more police and soldiers to provide effective protection to the two embassies before their evacuation. Regarding general German and Italian nationals, orders have also been issued to local authorities to provide protection. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed orders for the evacuation of Chinese embassy personnel in Germany and Italy. As for the issue of Chinese nationals in Germany and Italy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is consulting with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and the Ministry of Education.

<p>Chongqing - China officially severed diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy today, demanding that diplomatic representatives of the Axis powers here leave Chongqing as soon as possible, and accusing the Axis of extending their aggressive policies to the Far East. Ling Qihan, an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, delivered the proclamation issued by the newly appointed Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi at 8:00 PM this afternoon to the German and Italian embassies, severing diplomatic relations. The staff of the German and Italian embassies here have received their diplomatic passports and have been guaranteed safe passage to the Guangxi-Vietnam border. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing - After the Axis powers recognized the Nanjing regime of Wang Jingwei, the Chinese government has completely severed relations with Germany and Italy today. The diplomats affected by the severing of relations are Chen Jie, the Chinese ambassador to Germany, Xu Daolin, the acting representative to Italy, Mr. Plasen, the German chargé d'affaires in China, and Mr. Gallo, the counsellor of the Italian embassy. Chen Jie has been stationed in Berlin since presenting his credentials to Hitler in 1939. Liu Wendao, the Chinese ambassador to Italy, returned to China in 1938. Germany has not appointed an ambassador to China since recalling its former ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, from Hankou in 1938. Italian Ambassador to China, Daliani, has never presented his credentials to the Chongqing government. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Regarding the recognition of the Nanjing organization by Germany and Italy, the Chinese government has received a report from the embassy in Berlin, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a statement as soon as it receives the official content of the document. The government does not attach much importance to this matter itself, as it is only a minor issue in the Sino-Japanese War. However, since Germany and Italy have taken such an unfriendly action, the Chinese government cannot but express its stance. According to an observation by a veteran in diplomatic circles, China is bound to sever diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy, and it is believed that the recognition by Germany and Italy must have involved an exchange of conditions. In other words, Japan should now agree to assist Germany in attacking the Soviet Union. However, one well-informed source said that this move has a promoting effect, but it is too early to say that Japan will immediately attack the Soviet Union. The recognition of Nanjing by Germany and Italy had long been agreed upon, but Japan itself delayed for too long before granting recognition, so Germany and Italy also procrastinated. Now that it has been decided to cultivate the Nanjing side, such as lending 300 million yen, Germany and Italy have been asked to fulfill their promises. Germany and Italy also have certain expectations, so this move was promoted. However, as a result of this evolution, Japan cannot but take action for Germany and Italy. According to intelligence received by a military agency, Japanese transport ships from Hainan Island and the navy in Taiwan have been transferred north, and some bases in South China will be abandoned. They firmly believe that Japan's attack on the Soviet Union is imminent. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Regarding the issue of Germany and Italy recognizing the Nanjing organization, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that a statement would not be issued until midnight. It is reported that the wording condemning Germany and Italy is extremely harsh. However, there are many concerns about overseas Chinese in Germany and Italy regarding future practical steps after the outbreak of the European war. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already telegraphed orders to the ambassador in Berlin and the representative in Rome, ordering them to immediately evacuate with all embassy and consular staff. At the same time, it is forbidden for the Huitong News Agency to publish manuscripts here. (Havas dispatch on the 1st)</p>
<p>Washington - Chinese Ambassador Hu Shi commented on the Axis powers' recognition of the Nanjing organization, saying that this move is sufficient to show the Axis countries giving Japan this difficult matter. From the Japanese side, after the last establishment of the Nanjing organization, it was originally hoped that the Axis would immediately recognize it, so this matter is actually too late. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Geneva - It is reported that all personnel from the Chinese embassies in Germany and Italy intend to withdraw to Switzerland. (Electric dispatch on the 1st)</p>

(Huitong News Agency dispatch on the 2nd) Agram - Croatian Foreign Minister Rokovich sent a telegram to Nanjing stating that Croatia has recognized Nanjing in accordance with the Tripartite Pact signed with Germany and Italy. (Huitong News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>No Change in Sino-American Relations</p>
<p>Washington - Undersecretary of State Welles declared here last night that the Axis powers' recognition of Nanjing will not affect American policy. The United States will continue to recognize Chongqing as the only legitimate government of China. There are various indications here that the United States is not paying attention to this move by the Axis powers, but rather sees it as an attempt by the Axis powers to appease Japan and maintain friendly relations with the Axis. Observers believe that the Axis powers' recognition of Wang Jingwei at this time reflects the Axis powers' deep concern that Japan's pro-Axis sentiment is wavering, so they decided to assist Japan diplomatically to "maintain its position" as much as possible. (United Press dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington - Assistant Secretary of State Welles stated last night that the official recognition of Nanjing by Germany and Italy does not cause the United States to change its relations with China and Japan in the slightest. (Reuters dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington - According to diplomatic sources here, the Axis powers' simultaneous recognition of Nanjing is intended to strengthen the power of pro-German elements in Japan in order to implement the war against the Soviet Union by assisting Germany. In reality, it is nothing more than a "war of nerves." It is believed that the United States' Far East policy will never change, and there is absolutely no prospect of recognizing Nanjing.

<h3>Fujian Province Adjusts Grain Management Agencies; Military Grain Transportation and Sales Handled by the Provincial Grain Administration Bureau; Grain Adjustment in Various Counties by the County Public G沽 Bureau</h3>
<p>Yongan - Fujian's grain management methods and business institutions are striving for improvement. Recently, the provincial capital made changes. In the past, the supply and adjustment of grain in various provinces was uniformly managed by the Provincial Grain Administration Bureau and the Public G沽 General Management Office. Now, in order to save expenses and seek simplicity, the Public G沽 General Management Office has been abolished from the first of this month. Grain supply in various counties has been transferred to the direct management of the County Public G沽 Bureau. In addition, a business office has been established in the Provincial Grain Administration Bureau to specialize in the transportation and sale of military grain and the supply and demand allocation of grain between provinces. The Public G沽 Bureaus of 22 counties, including southern Fujian's Qujiang, Nan'an, and Longxi, are also temporarily abolished due to limited manpower and financial resources. Efforts are first concentrated on the adjustment of grain in northwestern Fujian. As for the surplus and shortage of grain in various counties in northwestern Fujian, the provincial government has established temporary adjustment measures, dividing the counties in northwestern Fujian into four areas: supply, demand, self-sufficiency, and military grain. Before the autumn harvest, accurate estimates of the actual output are made separately, and the quantities to be supplied by each supply area and military grain area are stipulated. In addition, a small amount of grain within the province has been allowed to circulate freely in order to achieve natural adjustment. After the implementation of these measures, the people's food supply in Yong'an and Bianping and other places is abundant, purchases are convenient, and prices are also low. Yong'an is one catty per yuan, Nanping is one catty and two taels, while in rice-producing counties in northern Fujian such as Shaowu, Chongan, and Pucheng, three to five catties can still be purchased per yuan, and the amount of civilian storage is sufficient.

<h3>Chinese Army in Fujian Recovers Longtian</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Military news: (1) Japanese troops from the Jiangyin Island and other places south of the Minjiang River in Fuqing attacked Longtian (south of Haikou) on the morning of the 20th. After the Chinese army bravely counterattacked, they fought until noon on the 21st, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops retreated in defeat towards Fuqing and Haikou. The Chinese army completely recovered Longtian and seized many military supplies.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Analysis of Japan's Movements</h3>
<p>The first reflection of the Soviet-German war in the Far East was that China's diplomatic relations with Germany and Italy fell into a state that was difficult to maintain. This was not surprising at a time when international divisions were becoming increasingly clear and the Axis powers were eager to obtain foreign aid. Apart from this, the one that appears to be inactive on the surface, but is brewing in extreme anxiety internally, is none other than Japan today.</p>
<p>Speaking solely from the corner of the Far East, Japan does seem to have some initiative, but in the broader international arena, it only has passivity. The progress and retreat of its foreign relations is therefore because, in the past few years, Japanese politicians and diplomats have only been following the development of international politics step by step, trying their best to catch up. By the time they have achieved something through some operation and effort, the international situation has already changed, and as a result, everything needs to be re-examined. In the past three or four years, this situation has been seen once in the dispatch of Terauchi Daisaku to Europe to prepare for strengthening the Tripartite Pact, again in the conclusion of the Tripartite Alliance last autumn, and three times in the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact not long ago. All of these have not only failed to achieve the desired effect, but have also caused countless new confusions and disturbances. After the failure of the Dutch-Indonesian negotiations recently, the next step is still hesitant, and the sudden outbreak of unexpected war between the Soviet Union and Germany. This situation, even the Japanese themselves do not deny that it is an extremely difficult juncture.</p>
<p>The policy of advancing south and defending north has been the consistent advocacy of Japanese radicals since the outbreak of the European war. However, in fact, the advance south was delayed due to insufficient preparation, and the defense north was repeatedly delayed. It was not until Matsuoka's visit to Europe in April that the guarantee of neutrality with the Soviet Union was obtained. However, the Soviet-Japanese treaty was mainly initiated by the Soviet side. When the Japanese were complacent that they could let go and cross south, the Soviet-German war was already 80% mature. Hitler only waited for Greece to be included in the bag and would launch a large-scale attack on the Soviet Union, but Japan guaranteed the Soviet Union's neutrality when the Soviet Union was at war with a third country. The conflict between the Tripartite Alliance and the Neutrality Pact already existed at that time, but it was not until the actual outbreak of war between the Soviet Union and Germany that it was felt to be a problem.</p>
<p>However, at this time, the Nazi leadership is not concerned with these past grievances, but only with current practical benefits. Its recent measures towards Japan are clearly concessions to seek favor in order to win them over so that Japan will be directed to achieve the effect of encircling the Soviet Union. In Japan, the voice for advancing north has recently revived, and anti-American sentiment has become anti-Soviet sentiment. If the Soviet army unfortunately suffers defeat against Germany, the scene of sending troops to Siberia will inevitably be re-enacted. What's more, its vigilance against the Soviet Union has never been relaxed, and the strategic deployment for advancing north has already been completed, and it can be launched at any time. Everything is more convenient than attacking the United States by advancing south. However, Japan's current situation does not allow it to further consider this. First, the development of the international situation in recent times is almost entirely outside the scope that the Japanese authorities can grasp. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Japanese side was full of disputes, discussing for ten days before making a decision, but it was still only vague and wait-and-see. Moreover, the saying that the cabinet will be reorganized is again noisy, which is enough to show that the degree of confusion of its authorities is almost the same as when the Soviet Union and Germany concluded the Non-Aggression Pact. Under such circumstances, it is impossible to take decisive action. Second, a country can only have one definite basic national policy within a certain period of time. If it continues to waver and change repeatedly, it will inevitably make the people feel at a loss, thereby greatly reducing its strength. Its continuous wavering between invading China and advancing south and north for more than a year is enough to make it unable to complete any goal. Third, the relationship between Japan and Germany recently is far less harmonious than in a certain period in the past. Under the rapid progress of the German army, whether it will eventually develop to the Far East is a problem that the Japanese side is extremely worried about. The signing of the treaty with the Soviet Union does contain some meaning of alienating Germany, and blindly following the policies of other countries has recently been severely criticized by some Japanese. Fourth, from the perspective of the Far East situation, Japan is surrounded by enemies. Only the relations with the Soviet Union to the north are slightly eased. If it actually turns from friend to foe again, then if it cannot obtain a guarantee of peaceful coexistence in other areas, it will inevitably fall into the siege of opposing forces on all sides. The recent developments in the international community regarding the Far East situation have made Japan's compromise with democratic countries even more impossible than before. Fifth, Japan's foreign policy in the future has a great tendency to re-orient towards Britain and the United States. However, when Japan is threatening Britain and the United States with the Tripartite Alliance and the Neutrality Pact, and it cannot cause the revival of Britain and the United States' appeasement policy, then at this time when Britain and the United States are less afraid of the Nazis than before, there is no need to lightly give them excuses to Japan. Based on this analysis, it can be seen that even if Japan's intention to advance north has recovered its strength, it cannot turn around due to various realistic conditions. If the Axis itself is unable to win in the war against the Soviet Union, what it expects from Japan will inevitably fail. However, if it is actually moved by the Nazi seduction, presumptuously advances north to show off its power, then its encounter can be expected to inevitably repeat the mistakes of sending troops to eastern Siberia in 1919, but because today's situation is very different from 22 years ago, the process of its failure will inevitably be incomparable to that battle.</p>
<h3>The Chongqing Tunnel Suffocation Case: The Review Committee Completes Its Work; Chairman Chiang Cables His Subordinates, Encouraging Them to Enhance Their Spirit of Loyalty and Dedication; Hopes the Public and Youth Will Participate in Air Raid Defense; Liu Zhi Relieved of Concurrent Position as Chongqing Air Defense Commander</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The review committee for the major tunnel suffocation tragedy in this city on June 5th has completed its work. The details of the review process are detailed in the review report. Since their establishment, the Air Raid Shelter Engineering Technology Improvement Committee and the Air Raid Shelter Management Improvement Committee have also convened meetings and discussed designs in detail, formulating future improvement plans separately (see reports of each committee for details). The plans have been submitted to the highest authority for approval and will be faithfully implemented by the responsible agencies. In order to handle this case, the Military Affairs Commission issued three orders, and Chairman Chiang also issued a circular telegram, repeatedly instructing air defense and rescue personnel, hoping to make up for past mistakes and promote future effects. The original text of the orders and circular telegram are attached below. (Orders of the Military Affairs Commission)</p>
<p>(1) Liu Zhi, concurrently commander of Chongqing Air Defense, should be relieved of his concurrent position. This order. (2) He Guoguang, deputy commander of the Chongqing Garrison, will concurrently serve as the commander of Chongqing Air Defense. This order. (3) Xie Yuanmo, deputy director of the Engineering Department of the Chongqing Air Defense Command, is to be dismissed for dereliction of duty in the major tunnel suffocation case that occurred in this city on June 5th. This order. (Circular telegram of Chairman Chiang)</p>
<p>Addressed to the Chongqing Air Raid Rescue Committee and forwarded to the Air Defense Command, the Chongqing Municipal Government, and relevant air raid rescue agencies and civil defense corps service teams: On the 5th of last month, a Japanese aircraft attacked a large tunnel in this city, causing a suffocation tragedy. Zhongzheng has been suffering ever since and has not forgotten it for a day. The review committee has now determined the actual situation at the time of the incident, and the Management Improvement Committee and the Technology Improvement Committee have drafted detailed plans for future air raid shelter management improvement and engineering equipment improvement measures, which have been reviewed and approved and are being actively implemented. Although the fellow countrymen who died this time cannot be brought back to life, we must take remedial measures to correct past mistakes. Recalling that all personnel serving in air raid defense, rescue, medical care, pensions, and fire protection in our capital for the past three years have mostly been loyal and dedicated, not afraid of hardship and danger, and actively increasing efforts to seize time. This spirit and facts are not only seen by the people of the city, but also make it impossible for the Japanese to succeed in their poisonous schemes. After this suffocation tragedy occurred, almost all the hard work of the past years was ruined in one fell swoop. The majority of the people were sacrificed in the tragedy, and those of our past service personnel who died in the line of duty cannot rest in peace. It can be seen that a single lack of consideration can make all efforts in vain, and one person's negligence can cause the entire group to be disgraced. Now that the post-disaster plan has been formulated, and the authority and responsibility of the agencies have been re-divided, from now on, I hope that all levels of service personnel will still maintain the essence of loyalty and dedication, remember the painful lessons of this time, redouble their vigilance, and work harder. Those government officials who are responsible should be more vigilant in adhering to their duties, especially cautiously, and must not be negligent in the slightest, resulting in mistakes. They should know that protecting the people is the responsibility of the government. If something is possible, but the effort is not exhausted, then even if the society does not blame them, they should feel guilty. At the same time, I hope that the public and youth will actively participate in air raid services, pool their wisdom and efforts, and work together to achieve success, hoping to make up for past mistakes and promote future effects. This is what I sincerely hope for. Zhongzheng, July 2nd, waiting for the secret report from Sichuan. (Electric dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>Madame Deng Baoshan Died in Bombing</h3>

<h3>All German Businesses in Qingdao Shut Down</h3>
<p>Qingdao - After the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, the Siberian Railway line to Germany was immediately closed. Consequently, all the flourishing businesses of German merchants in Qingdao over the past two years have now ceased operations. Peanut oil, a major product of Shandong province, was traditionally shipped to Germany in large quantities for the manufacture of artificial oil. German merchants have a significant stockpile of this, which they will now sell on the local market. Similarly, raw materials used to manufacture pigments, such as linseed oil and walnut oil, as well as squid oil used in making candles and soap, and soybean oil, cottonseed oil, pig bristles, sheepskins, pigskins, etc., which were traditionally procured and shipped to Europe by German merchants, are also affected. German merchants engaged in import businesses are also pessimistic about the future. The cotton textile industry anticipates significant changes in the North China pigment market, as most pigments were imported by German merchants. Once current inventories are exhausted, it will be difficult to obtain new supplies. Some merchants predict that the blue cloth worn by farmers and laborers will be greatly affected, as 90% of the dye used for blue cloth comes via the Siberian Railway. A large German trading house recently established a branch in Qingdao but is now making arrangements to withdraw. Furthermore, two major German manufacturing plants recently sent representatives here to promote their businesses, but they have now canceled their original plans and left quietly. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Nationals Unable to Return Home Stranded in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, transportation via Siberia has been cut off, leaving many German nationals unable to return home. The Imperial Hotel in Tokyo currently houses 100 Germans, with another 50 stranded in the area. Four hundred German nationals evacuated from the Dutch East Indies are expected to arrive here soon, and 150 German nationals from the United States are also preparing to come here. Currently, the only transportation route between Japan and Germany is via South America, but German nationals taking this route to return home risk being captured by British naval forces in the Atlantic. Therefore, most German nationals intend to stay in Japan for an extended period. The German Embassy and various Japanese-German friendship organizations are assisting these individuals in finding employment. (1st, Havas World Telegram)</p>
<h3>Flooding in Laos State</h3>

<h3>A Brief History of Riga, Capital of Latvia</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 2nd - Riga, the capital of Latvia, which was occupied by German troops yesterday morning, has a population of 350,000. It was occupied by Soviet troops last autumn. Historically, Riga was briefly under Russian rule after the Swedish-Polish-Finnish War in 1710. German troops occupied it on September 3, 1917, and it became the capital of the Republic of Latvia in November 1918. However, a few days later, when German troops withdrew from Riga, it was occupied by Bolshevik elements. On May 23, 1919, German troops entered Riga and liberated it. Therefore, July 1, 1941, marks the second time in 22 years that Riga has been "liberated" by German troops.</p>
<h3>Gale and Torrential Rain in Bombay, India; Transportation Halted</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 2nd - Telephone and telegraph communications between Bombay and major cities in India have been mostly cut off, and trains departing from Bombay have also been halted.

Rainfall of 15 inches north of Bombay has caused widespread flooding in the suburbs, disrupting railway traffic.</p>
<h3>United States and Burma Implement Reciprocity; Stop Collecting Import Duties on Ships and Goods to Facilitate the Mass Shipment of Supplies to China</h3>
<p>United Press, Hyde Park, 2nd - President Roosevelt has ordered that ships arriving at American ports from ports in Burma are to be exempt from ship taxes and unequal tariffs. Furthermore, Burmese products and products from various countries transported by Burmese ships are to be exempt from tonnage taxes. This order is retroactive to June 10 and aims to allow American supplies to be freely transported to China via the Burma Road. This is because the Burmese government must grant the same treatment to American ships and goods. The Burmese government has already ordered the abolition of import duties on American goods, so the U.S. President issued this order in response. The order does not explicitly mention the Sino-Japanese War, but its intention is clear. This order will remain in effect for the duration of the Burmese order.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd - According to Japanese newspapers yesterday, the greatest objective of the recent, active military cooperation between the U.S. and China seems to be the use of Chinese airfields. The U.S. has already dispatched a large number of airplanes to Chongqing, and many American pilots have arrived in Chongqing. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that this American assistance should not be overemphasized, but if the Japanese government does not take effective measures to counter this anti-Japanese demonstration, then the U.S. will increasingly use Chongqing as its Far Eastern frontline.</p>

<h3>U.S. President Reiterates Previous Statements; Willing to Maintain a Position of Peace, but Recognizes that Hope and Belief are Two Different Things; Refuses to Criticize Secretary of the Navy's Candid Remarks</h3>
<p>United Press, Hyde Park, 2nd - President Roosevelt reiterated yesterday the declaration of September 1939, stating that the United States will maintain a position of peace. The difference is that this time, the President specifically expressed doubt about the U.S.'s ability to maintain peace for a long time during the intense development of overseas wars. The President refused to comment on Secretary of the Navy Knox's statement on Monday night that the United States must immediately use its naval power to eliminate German forces in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 2nd - President Roosevelt received journalists yesterday and reiterated his hope that the United States could remain aloof from the war, but stated that hope and belief are indeed two different things. It is not difficult to see how the people of the country will vote on the question of whether the United States should actively join the war against the Axis powers, the President added, everyone is against war and against sin in the same way. The President stated over the past two months that he hoped that the U.S. could stay out of the war and had criticized the current authority's policies and guiding the country to actively participate in the war, so the President re-issued this statement yesterday regarding the arrest of spies, the President did not wish to make a statement.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 2nd - Secretary of the Navy Knox released a statement yesterday and advocated that the United States should destroy the German threat in the Atlantic at this time. The famous isolationist Senator Wheeler commented and said that Secretary of the Navy Knox's remarks are almost in conflict with the U.S. Constitution, if he does not resign automatically then the Senate and the House should take action on this matter.</p>
<p>International News Service, Hyde Park, 2nd - After Secretary of the Navy Knox's speech yesterday that the U.S. Navy should take action immediately, White House spokesman Senator Pepper said, "Knox's candid remarks are certainly jarring, but time and history will prove that he is correct."</p>
<p>United Press, Boston, 2nd - Civil Defense Director and Mayor of New York City, La Guardia, announced yesterday that the Department of the Army is now considering whether to issue gas masks to the 50 million people living in the Atlantic Gulf and Pacific coastal areas. These two places could be attacked by an enemy that would wage war against the Americas, he said, and the Department of the Army will also consider whether to establish American guard teams to protect locations such as factories and public utilities. At the 23rd Governors' meeting, they requested that a decision be made whether the guard teams of the states are sufficient, or whether federal assistance is needed.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Washington, 2nd - Reliable sources here announced this morning that the U.S. government has proposed a Pan-American export trade control system to the 21 American republics. This was proposed by U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles in the International Financial and Economic Advisory Committee of the Americas, with representatives from various American countries participating in the meeting. The purpose of this plan is to safeguard the raw materials needed for U.S. armaments.</p>
<h3>United States Should Quickly Resolve the Problem of Military Supplies Reaching Britain</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 2nd - The problem of American armed assistance to Britain has become extremely urgent as a result of the massive losses of British ships and German planes bombing Hong Kong, various industrial and transportation centers, this problem seems to be resolved to some extent in the coming weeks, by pressure from American public opinion. Resolving this problem has two sides. The first side advocates immediate escort, and even firing if necessary, the reason being that Britain cannot save itself, if the United States fails to save it in time, I am afraid that the consequences would be unimaginable, the second side says that even if the United States provides assistance it will not be able to save Britain, between these two sides there is still a compromise, this faction's decision will be produced soon, the author believes that even if this side of the Atlantic has various views on the degree of loss of British shipping, but Britain is already in a bad situation, the author believes that, according to careful research, the vessels damaged by the British allies and neutral countries since the beginning of the war 21 months ago, are a total of 6 million tons, the number of 488,000 tons lost in April seems quite true, from these losses it can be seen that only Britain alone can never win against the submarine and aircraft attacks in the Atlantic, if goods transported by the United States to Britain, and those able to reach Britain, are at a minimum below the required limits, then there will be a major impact on the British fighting force, our country has now, as President Roosevelt advocated, become the arsenal of democracy, whether military supplies can absolutely reach Britain in huge quantities depends on the decision of the people and Congress, our enormous industrial production last year, in terms of aircraft, has increased greatly, and 1,427 aircraft were produced in April, and this amount is only the beginning of production, electricity production has increased by one thousand percent, the manufacture of rifles and machine guns has also increased greatly, and tanks are produced at a rate of one hundred per month, which is only the beginning of production, there are 561 warships under construction, the problem at hand is whether we can transport these items to Britain before it becomes hopeless, the author believes that this is a problem that the United States should resolve quickly at present.</p>

Welles recently stated that the Soviet Union has contacted the United States regarding the purchase of key raw materials. Welles stated that Umansky has submitted this request to the appropriate parties, including the Production Bureau, and that the Lend-Lease Act and the price of raw materials were not mentioned. Welles also stated that he could not announce the types of raw materials that the Soviet Union currently needs, and that the United States is currently considering lifting all export restrictions on trade with the Soviet Union.</p>

<h3>German Forces Launch Full-Scale Offensive; Soviet Troops Engage in Fierce Resistance, Vowing Not to Yield an Inch; Germany Claims Capture of Riga and Lusk</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – Reports indicate that the Soviet-German war across the entire front has intensified. Despite facing fierce resistance from Soviet troops, Nazi forces claim to have penetrated deeper into Soviet territory, capturing Riga, the capital and seaport of Latvia, and Lusk, south of the Pripet Marshes in Soviet-held territory. Moscow has not yet acknowledged the loss of these two cities but stated that Soviet forces have withdrawn from Lviv. A summary of the general situation on the entire front today is as follows:</p>
<p>In Finland and the far north, the German side claims that German-Finnish forces have crossed the narrowest part of Finnish territory near the White Sea, Kandalaksha, cutting off the rear of Soviet forces in Murmansk or the northern Kola Peninsula. The Soviet side claims that enemy forces in that area, after making some advances, have been contained by Soviet forces in the Murmansk region. In the Baltic region, the German side claims that a German vanguard led by Colonel Lusch advanced rapidly through Mildo (27 miles southwest of Riga) and reached the southwestern district of Riga on June 29th, and has now occupied the city. Both sides report Soviet counterattacks along the Dvina River between the coast and a certain city in the southeast, but Soviet forces within Lithuania and Latvia appear to be trapped in one corner. In the Minsk area, the German side claims that its vanguard has reached the Berezina River. The Soviet side reports that Soviet forces are putting up strong resistance in the Krubek district (85 miles southeast of Minsk) on the banks of the Berezina River. Both the Soviet and German sides have mentioned the fierce fighting of a Soviet unit isolated between Bialystok and Minsk in the southwest. In the Lviv area, the German side claims to have occupied Lviv, and the Soviet side also admits that Soviet forces have withdrawn from the city, adding that Soviet forces counterattacked about 40 miles east of Lviv, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. However, German forces may now have launched a pincer movement, advancing from Lviv in the north and Bukovina in the south, with elite troops leading the charge. On the Romanian border, both sides report fierce fighting on the Prut River. The Soviet side claims that enemy attacks have been repelled.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – The German official news agency broadcast last night that German forces had occupied Lusk in Poland, and Riga, the capital of Latvia, had also fallen. The capture of Lusk was achieved by three tanks advancing ahead of the main German forces. These three tanks, after entering Lusk, were cut off due to the burning of a bridge, but still defeated two Soviet tanks and three heavy anti-tank guns, and subsequently repelled four Soviet tanks and one armored reconnaissance vehicle. By evening, German forces had completely occupied the city. (Note: Lusk is an industrial city on the Styr River, 85 miles northeast of Lviv, strategically located on the path of German forces advancing towards Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine.) A recent German communiqué stated that Soviet communications had been damaged by German air raids, with four sections of the railway line from the Baltic Sea to Leningrad damaged. Yesterday, five troop trains and one ammunition train in the central region were destroyed by bombing. A foreign dispatch from Riga stated that Riga is now under German control. The city's radio station had been silent for several days but resumed broadcasting yesterday morning, with a German officer announcing the fall of Riga.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – A German radio broadcast of a German High Command communiqué stated that German forces had occupied Riga, and German forces between Gachassin Mountain and Pripet Marshes were currently advancing, pursuing enemy forces on both sides of Lviv. Soviet forces besieged between Bialystok and Minsk fought fiercely for days, attempting to break through without success, suffering extremely heavy losses. Enemy troops repeatedly used heavy tanks to assist in the fighting, but all attempts to break through failed. German forces in the east have reached the Berezina River. German forces on the front line between Dunaburg and Riga have reached the Daugava River and have forcibly crossed the river in several places. Enemy counterattacks in this area have also been repelled. German air forces are assisting in the fighting by launching attacks everywhere, bombing retreating enemy forces in several directions east of Lviv. German aircraft have also attacked and heavily damaged Soviet forces besieged between Bialystok and Minsk and those retreating from Riga. At night, German air forces also bombed coastal ports in the east and south.</p>
<p>Soviet-German War Report</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 2nd – The Soviet Information Bureau released the following report on yesterday's combat situation: "Yesterday, our forces continued to fight fiercely in Murmansk, Kholm, Twersk, Minsk, and Lusk. In other areas, our forces maintained defensive lines, preventing enemy forces from crossing the border. In the Murmansk area, superior enemy forces have been prevented from advancing due to our resistance. In the Kholm area, the enemy launched simultaneous attacks at several points, but all were repelled by our counterattacks, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. In the Twersk area, our forces fought valiantly against enemy tanks and infantry, preventing them from crossing the Tsaperna River. In the Minsk area, our forces continued to fight against enemy mobile units. Our forces used defensive lines of anti-tank artillery fire (this line consisted of continuous rapid-firing cannons and machine guns) and counterattacks to prevent enemy tanks from advancing, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In the Lusk area, we have crushed the offensive of a large enemy tank force. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses in that area. In the Lviv area, our forces have withdrawn according to the original plan."</p>
<p>According to reliable reports, 50 enemy aircraft were shot down on the 30th, and we also lost 17 aircraft. Our infantry and tank forces are defending the homeland and have done their duty to the fullest extent, overcoming countless difficulties. Every inch of land will not be easily given up. Although fascist soldiers have repeatedly launched attacks, they have all been repelled by our hand-to-hand combat. Yesterday, the enemy lost 50 tanks. A certain infantry unit destroyed 6 tanks, and a certain anti-tank artillery unit destroyed 80 enemy tanks.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 2nd, German Führer's Headquarters – The German war report this afternoon stated that German forces are fighting against Soviet forces in Eastern Europe, making rapid progress. A major tank battle occurred in Slozsovo, south of Pripet, where 100 Soviet tanks were destroyed. In the area of Dubno, German forces engaged in a fierce battle with Soviet forces for two days, annihilating the Soviet forces, with 120 armored vehicles falling into enemy hands. The majority of Soviet forces surrounded east of Bialystok have been annihilated, with 100,000 prisoners, 400 tanks, and 300 cannons falling into German hands. Riga has been occupied by German forces, and Windau in western Latvia has also been seized. German forces and Finnish forces yesterday prepared to attack Soviet territory together with Finland. German aircraft provided cover for infantry attacks on enemy concentration points. Soviet forces retreating east of Lviv and towards Estonia encountered air raids and suffered heavy losses. The Soviet Air Force repeatedly suffered setbacks. Hungarian forces attacking from the Carpathian Mountains have joined forces with German forces.</p>
<p>The German Offensive Route into the Soviet Union is Obvious; the Soviets Should Emulate the Spirit of China</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – A Reuters military correspondent stated that if German forces capture Minsk, they will quickly attack Moscow and, at the same time or after reaching Moscow, move north to threaten Leningrad, launching a large encirclement operation against Soviet forces still fighting on the Baltic front. German forces in the south, advancing towards Kyiv from the northwest, will also move to directly target Odesa, launching another encirclement operation aimed at cutting off the rear of the entire Soviet force on the Bessarabia-Ukraine front. If the German side succeeds in this move, it will not only destroy a large part of the Soviet forces but also devastate a large part of Ukraine with minimal resistance. The German advance south into Ukraine from the north may not have been anticipated by the Soviet side. At that time, the German side will likely win over the Ukrainians and minimize damage to the harvest as much as possible. The German occupation of Lviv may be a sign of this strategy. The German side has employed this tactic in Poland and France, namely using overwhelming force to break through enemy lines in a frontal attack, followed by a large encirclement operation to cut off the rear of large enemy forces and force them to surrender. Of course, the Soviet side is currently facing danger, but it can quickly mobilize sufficient reserve forces to overcome it. Even if German forces achieve their current goal, namely occupying the line from Leningrad through Moscow to the Black Sea, they may not necessarily win. Everything from now on depends on the Soviet government's determination to lead the country and the full efforts of the Soviet people to continue the struggle. Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his people have set a great and noble example for the Soviets, and the Soviet side's resources, factories, and railways are far beyond what China can match.</p>
<p>German-Finnish Allied Forces Reach the White Sea Coast; 20,000 Soviet Troops Surrounded in Hanko</p>
<p>United Press, Helsinki, 2nd – Well-informed sources in Finland stated yesterday that German-Finnish allied forces operating in the Kola area have reached Kandalaksha on the White Sea, cutting the Soviet forces around Murmansk into two segments. Kandalaksha is also an important military transportation center because the Leningrad-Murmansk railway passes through it.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 2nd – "Stockholm Times" recently reported that 25,000 Soviet troops stationed on the Finnish island of Hanko have been surrounded by Finnish forces. Hanko Port is located in southwestern Finland and was ceded to the Soviet Union as a military base after the Finnish-Soviet War.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 1st – There are two islands in the Gulf of Finland separated only by a strait. Our troops are stationed on one of them, while the other is occupied by enemy forces. On the morning of June 29th, enemy artillery began to roar, and the entire strait was obscured by smoke. The enemy began to advance, and ships could be glimpsed coming forward through the smoke. Enemy machine gunners were ready to fire, but the Red Army remained calm and did not move until the enemy reached a distance of 100 to 150 meters, at which point they opened fire with a barrage. The enemy ships tried to retreat, but it was too late. Although they tried to return fire with machine guns, most were destroyed. Only a few landed, but they were also defeated by our bayonet squads and completely annihilated.</p>
<p>Nazi Air Force Extremely Active; Bombing Soviet Rear Lines of Communication</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 2nd, Berlin – According to responsible sources, German aircraft have repeatedly bombed Smolensk, between Minsk and Moscow, hitting ammunition and aircraft factories. Airfields have also been bombed. German aircraft also bombed and destroyed the seaport of Murmansk. The railway between Odesa and Tarnopol in southern Soviet Union has also been cut off by bombing. The power plant in Girosske has also been hit.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 2nd, Berlin – The aircraft used by the German Air Force to destroy enemy rear lines of communication include not only fighters but also destroyers and bombers. Several sections of the railway from Potokov to Leningrad were destroyed by bombing on Monday, depriving Soviet forces retreating from Latvia of transportation. Communication lines in the central war zone have also been bombed, with five freight trains and one ammunition train destroyed. Five cannons, nine tanks, and hundreds of freight cars were also destroyed.</p>
<p>Red Army Fights With Unwavering Resolve; Ingenious Defense Arrangements</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – A dispatch from Berlin reports that German reports indicate that Soviet soldiers in the current war consistently display a willingness to die that is unmatched by the enemy. Soviet soldiers possess an unwavering spirit and hold their ground, willing to perish with their fortifications. The Soviet army's arrangement of defensive trenches and underground communications is quite ingenious, as in the last great war. Soviet forces often adopt the ambush tactics they used in the previous civil war, encircling and annihilating enemy troops even after the first wave of attackers has broken through between the first and second lines of defense. Therefore, the fighting everywhere is extremely fierce. The Soviet Air Force is very brave when attacking, but its aiming technique is relatively poor.</p>
<h3>Auchinleck Succeeds Wavell as British Commander in the Middle East; Wavell Transferred to India; Lyttelton Joins the War Cabinet</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – An official announcement states that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, has been exchanged with General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of India. It was also announced that Lyttelton has been appointed as a member of the War Cabinet and will represent the Cabinet in handling the planning necessary for operations in the Middle East. The news of Wavell's transfer to India as Commander-in-Chief has surprised all newspapers, but all believe that Wavell has been overworked in the past year and clearly needs to be reassigned to a less demanding position. It is reported that this is a wartime appointment, with the duration of the term depending on military circumstances. General Auchinleck was born in 1884 and is known for his prudence and agility. He led Allied forces in capturing Narvik in the Norwegian campaign and was appointed Commander-in-Chief of India earlier this year.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – In the House of Commons today, questions were raised regarding Lyttelton's appointment as Minister of State and the exchange of General Wavell and General Auchinleck. Prime Minister Churchill replied that he did not intend to comment on this transfer and stated that this transfer had received very broad approval and was a beneficial and important step.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 2nd – Due to the British government's implication that Britain may use India as a major route for assisting the Soviet Union, and also wants to strengthen India's defenses to prevent a German attack in the near future, the government announced today that General Wavell, the current Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, has been transferred to the post of Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in India. The current Indian General Auchinleck will succeed General Wavell as Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East. News of this has been greeted with excitement in London, but newspapers cannot immediately offer criticism on this change. However, the British Authority News Association pointed out that General Wavell's mission to India is to actively preside over matters relating to Soviet aid via India. General Wavell is very familiar with the Soviet Union and the tactics being implemented on that terrain, so the above opinion is all the more powerful. According to the "Daily Express", the British government's move is due to fears that the German threat will soon approach India after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The report also predicted that General Wavell's transfer to Commander-in-Chief of the Indian forces is another method by which the British government seeks to protect and consolidate its position in the Near East. The British government also announced that Colonel Lyttelton, the British Minister of Commerce, has been appointed as a member of the War Cabinet with the special status of Middle East Representative. Lyttelton has already taken a special express plane to Cairo last night to inspect the Middle East situation. At the same time, it was learned that General Auchinleck has arrived in Egypt to take over General Wavell's position.</p>

<h3>British and Soviet Diplomatic Activities in Ankara; Soviet Ambassador to Turkey Returns to Post</h3>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 2nd – The Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Vinogradov, returned here yesterday by plane from Moscow.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 2nd, Ankara – After the Soviet Ambassador to Turkey returned to his post from Moscow, the British and Soviet embassies have been exceptionally active in the past 48 hours, with frequent meetings between the ambassadors and military attachés of the two countries.</p>
<h3>Soviet Defense Committee Orders Protection of Farms; Prevents Enemy Sabotage of Crops; Female Students Eager to Serve the Country</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – According to Moscow Radio, the Soviet Defense Committee recently issued an order that fire-fighting guard teams should be organized in all farmlands and farms to patrol day and night to prevent enemy sabotage of crops. All granaries, agricultural machinery, and all equipment must be carefully protected against fire.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd – Moscow last night appealed to male and female doctors to serve the country as soon as possible, so that all parts of the front line have adequate medical facilities. Many female students have now voluntarily requested service. The radio also instructed soldiers throughout the country to beware of German forces wearing Red Army uniforms, in order to prevent the cunning enemy from carrying out their evil schemes.</p>

The university library recently received funding from the Rockefeller Foundation and is currently engaged in a large-scale collection of Chinese history, geography, and general reference books, with a special focus on the Ming and Qing dynasties. Under the leadership of A.B. Beardsley, its law library launched a project to collect reference materials on Asian legal systems a few months ago. With the assistance of Mr. H.T. McClelland and Mr. Parsons, it has acquired hundreds of Chinese books. Mr. McClelland generously donated his entire collection of Chinese law and philosophy acquired during his travels in China. All of this is being processed using a dual cataloging system. In addition, G. Taylor of Yenching University has been hired as an associate professor and director of the Department of Oriental Studies at the school.</p>

<p>(4) University of Pennsylvania</p>
<p>Dr. D. Bodde, in cooperation with the Department of Oriental Studies, is planning a course on "The Ancient Orient" and a research class on "The Complex State of the Orient from Ancient Times to the 10th Century AD." The latter will discuss not only China but also India and Mesopotamia. In addition, a general lecture course on "The History of Chinese Culture" and "Three Years of Chinese" will be added. The university library has received a new three-year grant and is working hard to acquire Chinese and Western books.</p>
<p>(5) Cornell University</p>
<p>Professor Tai-Fu Feng is currently an associate professor of Chinese history at the school, teaching two courses: "Introduction to the History of Chinese Civilization" and "History of Modern Chinese Political, Economic, and Cultural Relations."

Gaskill, a staff member of the Wason Collection, will also offer a course on Chinese historiography and bibliography. The Wason Collection, which includes all the books donated by Wason, 15,000 Western books and 10,000 Chinese books, has been located at Cornell University for more than ten years. It is now planned to expand it significantly in order to collect all important books of general interest to historians and some specialized works on Qing history.</p>
<h3>Sixth Academic Lecture to be Held on the 6th of This Month; Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang Still Invited to Speak</h3>
<p>The open lecture series organized by the eight elders of this city has been held five times, with remarkable results. Since the first lecture in the series invited Jiang Zhuzhuang to speak on the problem of life, most of the audience admired him and felt that the first lecture was too short and did not satisfy their wishes. Therefore, they sent letters to the lecture series, requesting that they negotiate with Mr. Jiang to speak again, and some requested that the topic of self-cultivation in life still be used. It would be best if Mr. Jiang talked about his own outlook on life and self-cultivation, so that he could share his personal experience and the audience could benefit more. Mr. Jiang has served in education for more than 40 years and is always worried that he cannot teach all students. Therefore, taking advantage of the remaining summer vacation, he agreed to speak again on "My Outlook on Life and Self-Cultivation" at the sixth lecture of the series, which will be held at the Xuan Gong Theater at 10:00 a.m. on the 6th of this month. Jiang is the author of "Yinshi Zijing Meditation Method." This book has been in circulation for nearly 30 years and has more than 100,000 readers. It is estimated that more than 10,000 people have directly or indirectly benefited from following his daily self-cultivation rules. This time, Mr. Jiang will use his lifelong self-cultivation experience to share his personal experience, point out, and teach orally to the public in this hot summer, which is truly commendable.</p>

<h3>American Writer Wolfe Passes Through Shanghai: Discusses Factors in German-Soviet War - Hitler Striving to Destroy Soviet Union, but German Military Strength Declining - German and Soviet Military Forces Equal; Minsk Battle Important</h3>
<p>American writer Henry C. Wolfe recently visited Shanghai. After staying for a week, he will travel south to Hong Kong and the Dutch East Indies to conduct special journalistic work. Wolfe traveled to Europe to conduct research after the First World War and has extensively studied the German-Soviet situation.</p>
<p>The Biggest Reason for Nazi Attack on Soviet Union</p>
<p>Yesterday morning (2nd), Wolfe met with reporters and stated that the biggest reason for the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union was to prevent the Soviet Union from becoming a military power in Hitler's rear. Obtaining raw materials from the Soviet Union was also an important issue. The German-Soviet war will have a significant impact on future developments. Hitler's main effort is to focus on destroying the Soviet Union so that he can conduct more effective warfare against Britain and even the United States in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Two Continental Powers Cannot Coexist</p>
<p>At the same time, one factor that should not be ignored is that "the Soviet Union is fighting for itself, not for others." The European continent is not large enough to accommodate two major military imperialist powers such as Germany and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Hitler's main goal is to defeat the Soviet Union so that he has no worries about the future. According to Wolfe, Hitler understands that this is a protracted war that may continue for five to ten years. Therefore, it is necessary to destroy the Soviet Union before he can shift his full attention to the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Initially Hoped for a Slower Pace of War</p>
<p>Even if Hitler did not wage war on the Soviet Union, he could still obtain the necessary supplies from the Soviet Union. Stalin was willing to do everything in his power to supply Germany, hoping that the war would be delayed for another year, so that the Soviet side could become even stronger during this period.</p>
<p>Equal Strength in Terms of Soldiers</p>
<p>Germany is becoming increasingly weak due to its war against Britain. In terms of soldiers, Germany and the Soviet Union are equal, both being very good. In terms of equipment, the German side is better. However, German officers are far superior to Soviet officers. During Stalin's purges, Soviet military talent was damaged.</p>
<p>Smooth Highways Benefit German Army</p>
<p>The weakness of the Soviet army is the lack of the long and careful training necessary for officers to conduct warfare, and the staff work of the Soviet army is not yet comparable to that of the German army. The Soviet side has built a perfect military highway from Minsk to Moscow. Now that the German army has captured Minsk, its mechanized units can make good use of this highway.</p>
<p>Wolfe's Predictions Have Been Fulfilled</p>
<p>Wolfe's writings on Europe are widely circulated. In June 1939, Wolfe wrote an article predicting that the Soviet Union and Germany would compromise. Two months later, the Treaty of Non-Aggression was signed. In April of this year, Wolfe wrote another article predicting that war would break out between Germany and the Soviet Union, which has now come true.</p>
<h3>Pacific Hurricane to Hit Shanghai - Currently Moving Northwest</h3>
<p>Due to its northwestward movement, the Pacific hurricane has a strong tendency to strike the southern coast of China. This hurricane did land west of Hong Kong the day before yesterday. However, after landing, the hurricane's force weakened and completely dissipated last night. However, another hurricane has formed in the Pacific Ocean. According to a Reuters reporter's inquiry at the Xujiahui Observatory yesterday morning, the newly formed hurricane is currently located at 13 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude, with its center within 120 nautical miles. The wind is moving northwest or northwest by west. Although it is currently far from Shanghai, if its direction remains unchanged, it will again strike the southern coast of China. As for the weather in this city, it has been extremely hot for days, with temperatures rising above 90 degrees. The entire city is like a boiling pot. As a result, true cholera has been discovered. Residents should not neglect prevention in order to avoid infection and protect their health.</p>
<h3>France and Soviet Union Sever Diplomatic Relations - No Repercussions in this City - No Friction Between French and Soviet Residents - Soviet General Association Still in French Concession</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that yesterday (1st) rumors spread that as a result of the Vichy government's severance of diplomatic relations with Moscow, the French Concession authorities in this city would take action against Soviet organizations and periodicals within the Concession. These rumors have not been confirmed by French officials.</p>
<p>Soviet General Association Has Not Moved Out</p>
<p>A senior official at the French Consulate General stated that such matters are handled by the police department. A spokesman for the French police department stated that he was unaware of any possibility of taking such action. A semi-official Soviet source stated that they had heard rumors that the French authorities might instruct the Soviet General Association on Foch Road to move out of the French Concession, but had not yet received such an order. Responsible French officials stated that if any action were taken against Soviet residents, it would likely be directed at the Soviet General Association and various Soviet periodicals.</p>
<p>Newly Published Publications Prohibited from Sale</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, a recent incident can serve as evidence, namely that the pictorial magazine "Argus," which describes Allied military operations, was banned from being sold in the French Concession last week. The French police department issued this ban without providing a reason. Furthermore, a charity bazaar that British residents planned to hold in the French Concession to raise funds for the British War Fund was suddenly banned and had to be moved to the International Settlement. Well-informed French sources admitted that the severance of diplomatic relations between the French and Soviet governments might have repercussions in this city, but stated that, in their opinion, the authorities would not allow such repercussions to occur.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing Order and Peaceful Coexistence</p>
<p>As in September 1939, when France and Britain declared war on Germany, the French Concession authorities did not take action against German residents or German organizations within the Concession. In order to safeguard the peace and order of this international city, the French authorities are unlikely to take any action against Soviet residents, as France and the Soviet Union are currently coexisting peacefully and may continue to do so in the future. The problems of the Soviet General Association and the small number of Soviet publications in this city are extremely minor and do not require action that would provoke opposition from Soviet residents in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Rice Ships Delayed in Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Pacific hurricane struck the South China Sea, many ships have been affected. The French cargo ship "Vạn Luân Nà," agented by the Wayfoong Company, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Vietnam on the 1st, but has now been postponed and is expected to arrive in port today or tomorrow, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf, carrying 47,000 bags of rice. The Norwegian cargo ship "Glan," has also been delayed by two days and is now scheduled to arrive in this port from Rangoon, Saigon, Hong Kong, and other ports on the 5th or 6th, carrying 27,150 bags of tribute rice, and will be docked at Pudong to unload.</p>
<h3>US Maritime Commission Accelerates Shipbuilding Program: 1.25 Million Tons to be Completed This Year - Two New Cargo Ships Have Arrived in China</h3>
<p>According to sources in the American shipping industry in this city, the US Maritime Commission reports that American shipyards will be able to build 1.25 million tons of merchant ships this year. With the United States rapidly expanding its shipbuilding facilities, merchant ship production will increase to 3.6 million tons in 1942 and 5 million tons in 1943.</p>
<p>More Than 700 Merchant Ships to be Built</p>
<p>The commission has now set the price for the 705 merchant ships it has already built and is building at $162.5 million. The 1.25 million tons of cargo ships built this year are part of the 200 medium-sized cargo ships that President Roosevelt announced at the beginning of the year would be completed this year with an investment of $300 million. Once these cargo ships are completed, they will be dispatched by the Maritime Commission and distributed to the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans to transport military supplies and other necessities to China, Britain, and other countries to strengthen their ability to resist the Axis powers and their allies.</p>
<p>"Luckenbach" Cargo Ships Arrive in China</p>
<p>With the current high demand for merchant ships, the US Maritime Authorities, in addition to rushing to build new ships, are also requisitioning seven President liners from the American Mail Line, totaling 70,000 to 80,000 tons. However, in order to ensure Far East freight transport and prevent trade from being affected by the requisitioning of ships, the American Mail Line has requested the US Maritime Department to allocate several ships from Luckenbach Steamship Company, one of the top ten American liner companies, to operate in the Far East. Among them, the "Duroth Luckenbach" and the "Hary Luckenbach" have already arrived in China. These two ships each have a net weight of 6,533 tons, a deadweight of 13,000 tons, and a length of 473 feet, which is longer than the President liners. The ships are mainly used for cargo and only have four passenger rooms.</p>
<h3>Two Labor Disputes Resolved Yesterday: Rice Shop Labor and Management Reach Draft Agreement - Tea Industry Dispute Fully Resolved</h3>
<p>The labor dispute in the rice shop industry in this city, which began on May 27, has lasted for more than a month. Due to the differing opinions of both parties, a satisfactory resolution has not been reached despite several rounds of negotiations. After another round of negotiations between the representatives of both parties, a draft settlement agreement was finally reached after repeated concessions. The full text consists of 18 articles, which the labor side has also expressed satisfaction with. It officially came into effect after being signed yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Thus, the labor dispute, which had lasted for more than a month, finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.</p>
<p>Measures to Improve Treatment in the Tea Industry</p>
<p>The strike by employees of more than 500 tea shops in this city, after repeated concessions from labor and management, had already partially resumed work the day before yesterday and was fully resolved yesterday. An agreement was also reached on salary increases and improved subsidies, etc., at the age of eighteen. The important points are recorded as follows: (1) Employee salaries are divided into nine grades: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I, as the standard numbers: (A) Those within 10 yuan shall be increased to 30 yuan. (B) Those above 10 yuan but less than 15 yuan shall be increased to 40 yuan. (C) Those above 15 yuan but less than 20 yuan shall be increased to 50 yuan. (D) Those above 10 yuan but less than 25 yuan shall be increased to 60 yuan. (E) Those above 25 yuan but less than 30 yuan shall be increased to 70 yuan.

Those above 40 yuan but less than 45 yuan shall be increased to 100 yuan. (I) All those above 50 yuan shall be increased by 100%. (2) Employee subsidies: Within the price limit of 110 yuan for rice by the Public Works Department, a monthly subsidy of 30 yuan shall be provided. If the limit is exceeded by 10 yuan, the subsidy shall be increased by 5 yuan, and so on (apprentices are not included in the ratio). (3) Monthly regulation of 6 yuan (4) Apprentice subsidies: 8 yuan per month in the first year, 12 yuan per month in the second year, and 16 yuan per month in the third year.</p>
<h3>New Free Policy for Children by Java Company</h3>
<p>Java Shipping Company has newly established free regulations for children. It is understood that (1) First-class passengers may bring one infant under the age of three free of charge. If they are over the age of three, they will be charged half fare. (2) Second, third, and fourth-class passengers may bring one infant under the age of two free of charge. If they are over the age of two, they will be charged half fare. (3) Those traveling to Xiamen, regardless of first, second, third, or fourth class, may bring one child under the age of three free of charge. (4) The free infant is limited to one person. For more than one person, a quarter fare will be purchased. (5) Passengers of all classes who are over the age of twelve must purchase a full ticket. The company has issued a notice regarding the new regulations to all passengers so they can follow them.</p>
<h3>From Hong Kong to the Mainland - Hong Kong Correspondence -</h3>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War, Hong Kong has become a connecting point between the mainland and overseas due to the closure of various ports. Going from the mainland to overseas and from overseas to the mainland must pass through Hong Kong. That is, transferring from Shanghai to the Sichuan-Guangxi area via Hong Kong is also a more convenient route.</p>
<p>There used to be many routes from Hong Kong to the mainland, but now they have gradually decreased, leaving only two: taking a boat to Rangoon and then taking the Burma Road, and going to Guangzhou Bay and then transferring to Yulin and Liuzhou. Taking a boat to Rangoon and then taking the Burma Road is a more convenient route, but the cost is quite high. Going to Guangzhou Bay and then transferring to Yulin and Liuzhou is more difficult, but the cost is much lower.</p>
<p>The only ship that regularly sails from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay is the "Diamond" ship, but there are several ships sailing from Guangzhou Bay to Macau, so passengers who cannot wait for the "Diamond" ship can first go to Macau and then transfer to Guangzhou Bay from Macau. Because only the "Diamond" ship sails from Hong Kong to Guangzhou Bay, passenger capacity is very tight and fares are very expensive. Even buying steerage class costs at least ten Hong Kong dollars.</p>
<p>After arriving in Guangzhou Bay, due to the damage to the highway, there are 420 li of road from Guangzhou Bay to Yulin with no transportation available, so you can only walk or ride in a sedan chair. This section of road usually takes five days to walk. The first day is 110 li to Mijiang, the second day is 90 li to Shijiao, the third day is 60 li to Liangtian, the fourth day is 70 li to Luchuan, and the fifth day is 90 li to Yulin. If you ride in a sedan chair for the entire journey, the chair fare is about 150 yuan. If you hire a sedan chair in sections, it will cost about 30 yuan per day.</p>
<p>After arriving in Yulin, you can take a bus directly to Liuzhou, with a fare of about 90 yuan, which takes about two days, but there is not necessarily a bus every day. In addition to taking the bus directly, you can first take the bus from Yulin to Guixian, and then take a boat to Guiping, and then take a bus from Guiping to Liuzhou. This way is cheaper. Taking the bus from Yulin to Guixian costs 35 yuan, from Guixian to Guiping costs about 3 yuan, and then from Guiping to Liuzhou via Shilong costs a total of 15.7 yuan. The total cost is only about 50 yuan, which is much cheaper than the direct bus.</p>
<p>Of all the routes, only the section from Lianjiang to Shijiao is not very peaceful because it has to pass through Jilong Mountain. Security in other places is very good and there is no danger. Only the section from Lianjiang to Shijiao is now safer than before, as more and more people are traveling there, and some cautious travelers often hire a few military or police personnel as bodyguards when they depart.</p>
<h3>Fire on Zhifu Road Destroys Four Buildings - Two Killed, Three Injured</h3>
<p>A sudden fire broke out on Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road, yesterday morning, resulting in the destruction of four city buildings, two people were killed in the fire, and three residents were injured after jumping from the building to escape. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Fire at Night Causes Great Loss</p>
<p>A fire broke out at the Ju Xing Restaurant at No. 163 Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road, yesterday morning at about 3:00 a.m. Due to the dry and windy weather, the fire immediately broke through the roof. After learning about the fire, the Public Concession Fire Brigade quickly dispatched five pump trucks to put out the fire. The fire was put out at about 5:00 a.m. As a result, in addition to the Ju Xing Restaurant at No. 163, whose building and belongings were completely destroyed, the fire also affected the Long Xing Vegetarian Restaurant at No. 159, the buildings at No. 157 and No. 161, and part of a building in Changji Lane, causing great losses.</p>
<p>Three Injured after Falling; Two Bodies Dug Out</p>
<p>When the fire broke out, it was late at night. The residents on the upper floors of No. 163 were awakened from their dreams and jumped from the building to escape. Yao Rong (21 years old), Qin Naian (24 years old), and a man (23 years old) were all injured in the legs. They were sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the fire yesterday morning, firefighters were cleaning up the scene when they dug out two male bodies in the rubble. It was discovered that the two bodies were residents living in the back building of No. 163. The bodies were sent to the coroner's office for examination. The cause of the fire is currently being investigated by the police.</p>
<h3>Building Near Yiyuan - Royal Cinema - Capacity of More Than 1,000 Spectators - To be Completed and Open This Year</h3>
<p>The Times reports that a foreign businessman in this city will open a second-run cinema near Yiyuan at No. 1186 Lafayette Road and Albert Road at the end of November or the beginning of December. The construction cost is 1 million yuan, and it can accommodate more than 1,000 spectators, roughly equivalent to the Cathay Cinema. It is named "Royal Cinema." The French Concession authorities have already issued a license, and construction will begin soon. Since the opening of the Medical Painting Exhibition at the Pudong Fellow Townsmen Association, visitors have been coming in an endless stream. Mr. Zhang Shutong's ink landscape paintings are most admired by the audience. The picture on the right is one of Zhang's works. (Photo by Kang Zuyi)</p>
<h3>Canvas Factory Owner Xiang Meiying Nearly Kidnapped While Visiting a Friend; Xiang Struggles with the Bandits, Passersby Call the Police; Officers Arrive and Shoot Down One Bandit</h3>
<p>Yesterday's report mentioned a case on Daxin Street and Fourth Malu where bandits opened fire and resisted arrest, resulting in one being injured and captured. The truth of this case is that it was a failed kidnapping attempt. Xiang Meiying, the small owner of the Hechang Canvas Factory at No. 23 Ningbo Road, a native of Ningbo, is from a well-to-do family and owns two private cars.</p>
<p>Encounter in the Alley</p>
<p>Yesterday at 12:00 noon, Xiang drove his car, number 2049, to the home of a friend in Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, for lunch. When the car arrived at the entrance of Yingchunfang, Xiang was about to get out when suddenly a bandit, holding a gun, stepped forward. Xiang initially suspected it was a thief and told him that he had no money on him. The bandit then cocked the gun. Seeing that things were not good, Xiang immediately grabbed the wrist of the bandit holding the gun, and they struggled with each other. The bandit fired a shot, fortunately not hitting Xiang. At that time, passersby shouted "Robber!" The bandit, knowing that things were not going well, pushed Xiang to the ground and fled south.</p>
<p>Opening Fire to Resist Arrest</p>
<p>When the officer stationed at the Hubei Road and Fuzhou Road intersection, number 2104, heard the alarm, he rushed to the scene and fired six shots at the bandit. One bullet hit the bandit in the back, and he fell to the ground and was captured. A pistol and four bullets were confiscated. He was taken to the hospital by car. Subsequently, Li Pengfei, a Chinese detective from the Lao Zha Station, found that the bandit was named Yu Huacheng, a native of Shandong, 33 years old, and his injuries were serious. Yesterday morning, the station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, applied to the First Special Court for temporary detention of the suspect, pending his recovery and prosecution. Judge Fu Lin reviewed the report and approved the detention pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Criminal Cases of the Second Branch of the High Court Returned to the Original Site for Trial</h3>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has been located at Lane 155, West Chongqing Road, Weihaiwei Road, to continue its work. All civil and criminal appeals have also been heard at the new location. Now, due to the extreme heat, all criminal appeals are being heard in the morning, resulting in insufficient courtrooms. Therefore, from July 1st, criminal appeals will be moved back to the original site at Qipu Road, North Zhejiang Road, while civil appeals will still be heard on Weihaiwei Road.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur Steals Oil Carelessly, Burns Car; Liu Liansheng Arrested Pending Trial</h3>
<p>Liu Liansheng, a local, works as a chauffeur for a Belgian named Lan Fangdeng, manager of the Banque Belge pour l'Etranger on the Bund, driving car number 7854. Recently, Liu's living expenses have increased, and his income is insufficient. Therefore, he stole two gallons of gasoline from the car, worth nine dollars and twenty cents, and hid it under the driver's seat cushion. Unexpectedly, due to a gasoline leak, at 11:30 AM on the morning before yesterday, the car was parked on the Bund, and just as he was about to start the engine, it suddenly caught fire. In an instant, the fire spread and could not be contained. After reporting to the Fire Department, firetrucks were dispatched to the scene and extinguished the fire, but the car was completely burned, with losses amounting to over ten thousand yuan. Subsequently, Huang Hairu, a Chinese detective from the General Patrol Station, took the chauffeur Liu Liansheng into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The station's lawyer, Peng Qixin, presented the case and requested a rescheduling. Judge Shen ordered Liu to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing in seven days.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Exploits the Common People, Sentenced to Imprisonment; Zhu Shaoqiu Sentenced to Three Months</h3>
<p>Zhang Yunsheng, a Chinese detective from the Huishi Patrol Station, discovered on the 20th of last month that the Dafeng Rice Shop at No. 964 Tangshan Road was using a standard five-sheng measuring device with the opening shortened by about half an inch. Rice measured in this way was sixty taels short per dan, which constituted a violation of the law. Therefore, the patrol station requested the First Special Court to issue a warrant to bring the shop owner, Zhu Shaoqiu (30 years old), a native of Chongming, to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The station's lawyer, Fang Fushu, prosecuted him for fraud, requesting severe punishment according to the law. When questioned, Zhu claimed that he had acquired the measuring device from someone else and was unaware of the shortening. He asked for leniency. Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the evidence and announced the verdict in court, sentencing Zhu Shaoqiu to three months in prison and a fine of three hundred yuan. If the fine was commuted to labor, it would be calculated at two yuan per day. The measuring device was confiscated.</p>
<h3>French Concession Pharmacy Night Duty Schedule</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council has, for the convenience of residents within the concession to obtain medicine at night, specially announced and designated various Western pharmacies to take turns on night duty each month to provide services equally. At this summer season, this is important for public welfare. Therefore, the night duty schedule for this month is excerpted and published on the right:</p>
<p>"July 1st, 8th, 15th, 22nd, 29th: Prilly Pharmacy, No. 9 Luban Road; 2nd, 9th, 16th, 23rd, 30th: Pro-World Pharmacy, No. 949 Avenue Joffre; 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, 31st: Soviet Beck Pharmacy, No. 23 Avenue Henri; 4th, 11th, 18th, 25th: Piebeque Pharmacy, No. 664 Avenue Joffre; 5th, 12th, 19th, 26th: Standard Pharmacy, No. 710 Avenue Joffre; 6th, 13th, 20th, 27th: Ya Dong Pharmacy, No. 1918 Avenue Joffre; 7th, 14th, 21st, 28th: Prilly Pharmacy, No. 881 Avenue Joffre."</p>
<h3>Over 200,000 Silver Coins Shipped to Japan; Confirmed</h3>
<p>After the silver problem in the Tianjin Concession was resolved through an agreement between Britain, Japan, and France, 3 million Chinese silver dollars, equivalent to 3 million national currency dollars, were shipped from Tianjin this spring to British India for sale. The proceeds were to be used for disaster relief in North China. Recently, it has been confirmed by a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency at the Office of the Inspector General of Customs that silver coins worth 224,000 national currency dollars were loaded onto a ship at the Jiaozhou Customs and exported to Japan in mid-May of this year.</p>
<h3>Run Kangyong Yarn Company Fraud Case; Qi Zhaoji Detained; Accepts 140,000 Yuan Transaction in the Morning, Suddenly Closes in the Afternoon, Owner Flees</h3>
<p>Run Kangyong Cotton Yarn Company, located in Room 354, Securities Building, Jiujiang Road, was founded by Qi Zhaokang and Qi Zhaoji. On the 27th of last month, cotton yarn merchants Zhao Bingyan, Qi Yongkang, and others purchased 90 bales of cotton yarn from Run Kangyong, totaling 140,132.50 yuan. They paid the full amount at the time, but when they went to collect the warehouse receipt in the afternoon, the company suddenly closed, and the person in charge had disappeared. Only an apprentice, Song Yongfu, remained inside. He was arrested and sent to the First Special Court, where the hearing was postponed. Xu Wenbin, the detective from the Lao Zha Patrol Station handling the case, arrested Qi Zhaoji at No. 22, Lane 19, Huasheng Road, and took him into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The station's lawyer, Fang Fushu, presented the case and requested a rescheduling. Judge Dai briefly questioned Qi and ordered him to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Land in Kanmen; Yongjia Unaffected; Jiang Fang Strengthened in the Oujiang Area; It is Not Easy to Go Upstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this city received a telegram from Eastern Zhejiang stating that Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Yuhuan had lowered several small boats on the morning of the 1st, carrying several hundred Japanese soldiers, and landed in Kanmen, which belongs to Yuhuan County. According to inquiries made by reporters to Wenzhou natives in Shanghai, Yongjia has not sent a telegram reporting anything. According to those familiar with the situation, since Yongjia was recovered, the Japanese troops along the Oujiang area have completely withdrawn. However, Huang Da'ao Town, which belongs to Yuhuan County outside the port, is still occupied by the Japanese. This place is very close to Kanmen. It is possible that this landing at Kanmen is a branch from Huang Da'ao. However, Kanmen is outside the mouth of the Oujiang River. If the Japanese troops want to attack Wenzhou from there, it is definitely impossible because it is not easy to go upstream. Moreover, since Yongjia was recovered, the Oujiang River has been completely blockaded, and the river defenses have also been strengthened. Therefore, if a landing has indeed occurred at Kanmen, Yongjia will not be affected.</p>
<h3>Sponsoring Hidden Poverty; More Than 1,000 People Have Applied for Relief for Hidden Poverty</h3>
<p>Since the Three Teachings Moral Benevolence Society of this city concluded its congee distribution work at the end of March, it has been providing rice meals since April 1st. By the end of June, it had distributed a total of 100,000 bowls of white rice over three months and is actively continuing the distribution. However, due to limited relief funds, it appeals to all sectors to donate as much as possible to facilitate long-term operations.</p>
<p>Applications for Hidden Poverty Exceed 1,000</p>
<p>In addition, since the society announced its plan to provide relief for hidden poverty, more than 1,000 people in the city who have been educated, are unemployed, or whose income is insufficient have applied for relief. After the society sent personnel to investigate and verify the claims, it has provided assistance to more than 200 people. The rest are still under investigation. The society is also aware that the applicants' children are either unable to continue their education or unable to enroll. Therefore, if requests are made, it can introduce them to jobs and schools. To prevent deception, warnings will be issued to those who are found to be cheating.</p>
<p>Appealing to All Sectors to Sponsor Separately</p>
<p>The society believes that there are many hidden poor people in the city, and their lives are so difficult that good families are breaking apart and falling into degradation. Therefore, in addition to providing relief itself, it specifically appeals to all sectors to sponsor them separately. The procedures are as follows: anyone who wishes to sponsor one or more families, or a particular person, can arrange for the sponsor to meet and talk with the sponsored person or select and designate a target themselves. The sponsorship period can be determined by the sponsor, but the assistance funds will be transferred by the society. At the same time, to give the children of the hidden poor opportunities to learn a trade and further their education, all parties are also asked to notify the society of any opportunities for jobs or the skills needed so that the society can select suitable applicants to introduce for trials. Those who wish to donate funds for education can also designate how they are to be used.</p>
<h3>Fire at Fengmao Warehouse; French Authorities Attach Great Importance; Send Personnel to Investigate with the Fire Department</h3>
<p>A fire broke out suddenly at the Fengmao Warehouse, No. 8 The Bund, French Concession, this city, the day before yesterday, causing losses of up to 500,000 yuan. The French Concession Police Department and the French Fire Department attach great importance to this and have sent key personnel to the site of the fire to conduct a detailed inspection and investigate the cause of the fire. The cause has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Medical Association Ends Disease Prevention Campaign</h3>
<p>The Municipal Medical Association's disease prevention campaign, which began on June 1, has been underway for a month. More than 50,000 citizens have been vaccinated at the association's various injection sites, protecting citizens' health, and its contribution is indeed not small. It is now reported that the association has ended the campaign as scheduled at the end of June, according to the original date, and has notified all member injection sites to stop injections from July 1. However, citizens who have already had their first injection before June 30 but have not yet completed the three injections may still be accommodated, but they must present the disease prevention campaign record certificate issued at the time of the first injection to the original injection site and request to continue the injections and will still be given a disease prevention certificate. It is reported that during the association's disease prevention campaign, the vaccines used at the various injection sites were provided free of charge by the five major pharmaceutical factories: New Asia, Xinyi, Dahan, Sino-French, and Jiuxing. In addition, Xin Ya, Xin Yi, Zhongying, Wuzhou, Sino-French, Huamei, Jicheng, Yuzhou, Jiufu, Zhengde, Jixing and other pharmaceutical factories and pharmacies have donated advertisements, and therefore the association expresses its very sincere gratitude for the pharmaceutical industry's sincere assistance in this matter.</p>
<h3>Technicians in the Silk and Cloth Printing Factories Request Pay Raise</h3>
<p>Technicians in the silk and cloth printing and dyeing industry in this city have requested that employers improve their treatment and increase their wages. Unexpectedly, the factories have considered the results and have not agreed to increase their salaries, resulting in disputes between the two parties. The technicians of each factory are now requesting the Silk and Cloth Printing Technician Association to present a petition to the relevant authorities for assistance in mediation.</p>

<h3>Grain; Rice Market Closed for One Day; Slightly Increased When Reopened</h3>
<p>The rice market was closed yesterday on the first for the bi-annual settlement period for silver and money businesses, as is customary. Business resumed as usual yesterday. The trend has not yet broken out of a sideways state. When the market opened in the morning, due to the influx of existing stocks, buying was weak. The rice allocated by public warehouses for public sale is about to arrive in Shanghai one after another. Public sale tribute rice and June orders are also arriving in succession. Many floating stocks and scattered hoards are being released as the market changes. Therefore, prices for both spot and future rice have declined. Subsequently, domestic customers took advantage of the low prices to absorb stocks. Local businesses have been closed for several days and demand is still strong, while customers from inland areas such as Ningbo are particularly active. The market gradually rose, and the prices of various types of rice increased from low levels. As a result, some prices rose by several jiao to one jiao compared to the closing price the day before yesterday, while others remained unchanged. Yinghua Siji No. 2 Siamese rice was particularly strong, opening at 141 yuan to 141.3 yuan; small broken rice from 146 yuan to 148 yuan; broken tribute rice from 112.5 yuan to 114 yuan. 1,200 tons were traded. Spot rice: No. 1 Saigon rice 127.5 yuan to 125 yuan, No. 2 rice 121 yuan to 119 yuan, broken rice 96 yuan to 94 yuan, special Siamese No. 1 rice 131 yuan to 128 yuan, No. 2 rice 121 yuan to 119 yuan, rice tea 111 yuan, crushed rice 115 yuan, small broken rice 122.5 yuan to 120 yuan, Min Dang rice 130 yuan to 126.5 yuan, Tokyo crushed sharp rice 115 yuan, crushed sharp rice 95.5 yuan to 94.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica rice, due to the upcoming Little Heat season, inland inventories are dwindling, and few shipments are arriving. Merchants are more firm in their intentions, so local stores still feel unsatisfied. Most transactions are small, and the market has not seen any prosperity. Fresh early rice from the South Port is still priced at 137 yuan, big city rice at 136 yuan, and Zhongguan rice at 134.5 yuan. Wuxi original bagged aged japonica rice is priced from 131 yuan for high-quality rice to 126-127 yuan for secondary rice.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, also due to seasonal factors, whether domestic or foreign, continues to be in a state of scarcity and sluggish sales. As a result, the market color is often mediocre and rarely changes. According to statistics, yesterday's total glutinous rice transactions in the city were no more than two or three hundred dan, and the prices quoted were the same as before the holiday. Hong Kong white yuan is still priced from 120 yuan for high-quality rice to 116-117 yuan; glutinous green beans from 111 yuan for high-quality beans to 105-106 yuan; domestic yuan ordinary 121 yuan and 120 yuan; Zhongguan rice 118 yuan; high-quality rice is out of stock and the market is empty.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Becomes Firm Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot Western flour market became firm again. This is because the sale of Hua Factory's cheap flour has now stopped, and according to foreign firms, overseas sources are occasionally blocked. Therefore, Western rice in public warehouses must also be postponed to Shanghai, and with rice and oil prices rising, people's hearts are better. Speculators and hoarders have been absorbing stocks. Jinlong flour rose by five jiao upon opening, doing business at 32.5 yuan to 32.8 yuan. However, it calmed down slightly near noon, closing at 32.6 yuan. Other brands all called out higher prices. There was also Caishen flour at 32 yuan and Paotai flour at 33.23 yuan, purchased by local retailers for 500 bags. A total of more than 3,000 bags of Jinlong flour were traded, with actual sales accounting for half of them. The market situation is still considered stable. There is still no market for wheat.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes; Edible Oil Sales Active; Prices Rise Suddenly by One Yuan; Soybean Cake Spot Sales Also Rise</h3>
<p>Edible oil; yesterday, local retail sales were quite active. Major merchants were eager to sell, so the market suddenly turned lively, and prices rose by about one yuan compared to before. It is estimated that 80 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 200 cans of Yantai raw oil, 500 cans and 15 barrels of Jiangbei raw oil, 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 20 barrels of Hankou soybean oil, 70 barrels of Qingdao soybean oil, 40 barrels of Pudong soybean oil, and 400 dan of Qing oil from Dayou Factory were sold (prices detailed in the market price column).</p>
<p>Soybean cake; spot sales are gradually improving. Yesterday, inland gangs continued to load and transport in bulk, so people's hearts were encouraged, and prices rose by another two or three jiao. It is estimated that 3,000 pieces of Lu Zi soybean cake were sold, priced at 16.25 yuan to 16.3 yuan; 3,000 pieces of Dayou Factory soybean cake, priced at 16 yuan to 16.3 yuan; nearly 10,000 pieces of Shen Ji soybean cake, priced at 16.7 yuan to 16.9 yuan. Also, more than 20,000 pieces of July delivery futures were sold, priced at 17.55 yuan to 17.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton; American and Indian Cotton Prices Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market initially rose due to buying by traders, but subsequently fell slightly due to profit-taking by some, resulting in a closing price that was eight or nine pounds higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to selling by cotton merchants and profit-taking by bulls, but then rose slightly due to buying support. Yesterday's closing price fell by one or two rupees.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods; Cangzhou Red Dates Rise by Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Cangzhou red dates have recently been in short supply. The Chaohang has a batch of high-quality goods, a total of 89 bags, that are dry and good in color, and can be described as top-grade. They were all released yesterday, priced at 64 yuan, more than ten yuan higher than before. The market situation is very good.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market; Sugar Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained tight, and continued to rise by about one yuan to several jiao. The Association's closing prices: spot 24 crude white June new goods 92.2 yuan to 92.4 yuan, up seven jiao; May imports 91.1 yuan, up one jiao; April imports 90.05 yuan, up six jiao; March imports 89.8 yuan, up four jiao; Dutch red KD and 　mark initially 73 yuan, then rose to 73.2 yuan, 73.5 yuan, up half a yuan. Taikoo Che Bai is also tight, DY mark is 101 yuan, up about one yuan; HX mark 90 yuan to 90.02 yuan, 90.05 yuan, up seven jiao.</p>
<h3>Economic Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Feng Liu</p>
<p>Economics (4)</p>
<p>Japan translates "Economics" as 経済学 (Keizaigaku). Yan Fu (Jidao) already discussed its inappropriateness in the translated preface of Adam Smith's "The Wealth of Nations". Yan's intention was to name the Japanese translation of Economics as 計学 (Jixue) or the Science of Accounting. He said:</p>
<p>"計学 (Jixue), Western name Economics, originally from Greek. Eco means household, Nomics is the transliteration of Nemo (Note: Nemo is Latin, meaning management). Its meaning originated in household management. Expanding on this, it encompasses all matters of estimating, managing, economizing, and accounting for expenses and revenue. Extending it further, it includes the principles for a nation or the world regarding production and consumption. Thus, the scope of its meaning is extremely broad. Therefore, the Japanese translated it as 経済 (Keizai), and the Chinese translated it as 理財 (Licai). But if one must seek complete inclusiveness, 経済 (Keizai) is too broad, while 理財 (Licai) is too narrow. So I have taken it upon myself to use 計学 (Jixue) to represent it. Although the meaning of 計 (Ji) is more than just the purview of the officials in charge of land or the writings of 平準 (Pingzhun), when examining past texts, words like 会計 (Kuaiji), 計相 (Jixiang), and 計偕 (Jixie) (Note: all found in the Records of the Grand Historian), along with the common expressions 国計 (Guoji, National Account) and 家計 (Jiaji, Household Account), seem to correspond more closely to the Greek Nemo. Therefore, The Wealth of Nations is a book on 計学 (Jixue)."</p>
<p>I deeply agree with Yan's statement that " 経済 (Keizai) is too broad, while 理財 (Licai) is too narrow." Although the word 計学 (Jixue) can be said to correspond to the current so-called Economics from the perspective of Western etymology, I do not dare to fully agree.</p>
<p>Since the widespread use of the two characters 経済 (Keizai), they have now become a common buzzword. Regardless of whether it's vegetables, rice, paper, pens, or even various other things, and regardless of whether they are related or unrelated, scholars and non-scholars alike frequently use the term 経済 (Keizai). Generally, in common parlance, the meaning of 経済 (Keizai) is nothing more than spending less and achieving greater results, or having the meaning of rational use. This actually vaguely coincides with the old term 経紀 (Jingji). The characters 経紀 (Jingji) originally meant managing and organizing. Later, it was used in the context of business operations, calling merchants 行紀 (Hangji), and because there was the name 行紀 (Hangji), business people were called 経紀 (Jingji) households. Moreover, because the establishment and prosperity of business people mostly came from diligence and frugality, it also referred to those who were diligent, frugal, and good at managing their wealth as 経紀 (Jingji). Over time, its usage evolved, and it no longer has the same meaning as the current term 経済 (Keizai). When exchanges emerged, those who mediated buying and selling were called 経紀人 (Jingjiren), which is similar to the old 行紀 (Hangji) in that their business was to mediate and collect commissions.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the current common usage of 経済 (Keizai) is probably what was formerly called 経紀 (Jingji); the meaning of Chinese 経済 (Jingji) is not comparable to the current Economics. However, since we are already accustomed to it, let us follow the convenience of its use and also 経済 (Keizai) it. (End)</p>
<h3>Old Taikoo Warehouse Sugar Inventory</h3>

<h3>New Imports of Wild Silkworm Silk Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shandong wild silk was shipped to Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Shuntian Wheel brought 30 bales of silk tops, 7 bales of yellow silk, and 17 bales of wild silk, totaling 44 bales, from Yantai. The wheel arrived in port the day before yesterday afternoon, docked at the Pudong Wharf, and moved to the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, Puxi, yesterday morning to unload.

<h3>Piece Goods Loaded for North and South Seas</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 200 pieces of cloth were shipped to Yantai, 115 pieces to Hong Kong, 30 pieces to Singapore, and 14 pieces to Penang.</p>
<h3>Hardware; American Bar Iron Spot Goods Extremely Scarce</h3>
<p>Due to the active search by local canneries, toy factories, printing plants, cigarette factories, etc., the 200-pound American bar iron circulating in the market is temporarily in short supply. In addition, there has long been no source for this product overseas, and the Shanghai inventory is also thin. As a result, spot goods are increasingly scarce, and traders holding a small number of spot goods are very bullish, causing standard selling prices to soar. Recently, a standard assortment of 200 pounds per case is priced at 420 yuan, and large sizes are temporarily unavailable for purchase anywhere.</p>

<h3>The Love Affair of Cousin Siblings</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>A few days ago, newspapers all published a short piece of social news, saying that a pair of cousin siblings fell in love and, unable to bear being apart, committed suicide by poisoning, resulting in their deaths.</p>
<p>The reality is probably not that simple. However, this type of tragedy is already commonplace in China and not surprising.</p>
<p>Most people have a common idea that close relatives like cousin siblings should not marry because close marriages can produce offspring with intellectual disabilities or mental defects. Undoubtedly, the couple's suicide pact has a considerable connection to this kind of thinking.</p>
<p>However, according to recent research by geneticists, this concept is not entirely correct. According to a survey by Professor Easter of Harvard University in the United States, cousin siblings with healthy ancestors who marry do not have a greater risk of producing mentally unhealthy children than ordinary marriages. Even if they have unhealthy children, it is not caused by the cousin siblings' marriage, but because the previous generation had unhealthy genes that were exposed in the marriage of cousin siblings. Consanguineous marriages can preserve ancestral weaknesses within the family, and at the same time, they can also preserve strengths. In ancient times, the pharaohs of Egypt, the Incas, the South American Donamis, and the European royal families all practiced consanguineous marriages, but the results produced some great geniuses. The family of German musician Bach produced twenty-eight outstanding musicians in five generations, mostly as a result of cousin siblings marrying; they kept the musical talent within the family. Therefore, cousin siblings with good heredity can marry, according to genetics. As for cousin siblings with poor heredity, their marriage does increase the possibility of mental defects in their children.</p>
<p>We do not advocate cousin siblings marrying or consanguineous marriages, but only point out a new scientific fact, proving that marriage between genetically healthy cousin siblings is harmless and does not need to be opposed or prevented.</p>
<p>As for committing suicide by poison for the sake of love or marriage, it is a kind of naive act of young people, which belongs to ideological and educational problems.</p>

<h3>The Time of Yellow Plum Rains: Bacteria Fly</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>"Every house is bathed in the rains of the yellow plum season, the weather of ripe plums is half sunny and half cloudy." During this period, everyone in Jiangnan has felt annoyed, and what is even more hateful is that on everything, whether it is hats, shoes, or biscuit tins, even books on the bookshelf, you will find patches of velvet-like stuff, commonly known as mold. In fact, it is not mold, but a kind of lower plant, scientifically called mold; taking advantage of the humid environment of the yellow plum season, it launches a large-scale migration to all kinds of materials you own.</p>
<p>For this beautiful fungus - mold - we can only blame our own eyes for not being able to see its true face. However, the scientists in the laboratory have long observed it carefully under the microscope. It is said that this kind of mold is a microorganism composed of more than a dozen cells. They have willow-like bodies, branches, and separate branches, and they are also covered with velvet-like things, which become mold.</p>
<p>Fungi belong to the fungus phylum in the plant kingdom. They reproduce by spores. These spores are not the result of sexual reproduction, but a part directly split from the parent body. In the park, you may have the opportunity to pick a fern, open the back of its leaves, and you can see balls of millet-like things wrapped in the leaf pouches. With a gentle flick of your hand, they will fly away without a trace. The spores of mold are also like this; they leave the parent body and float in the air. As a result, they choose your hat and shoes to be their colonies.</p>
<p>In the colony, the spores take advantage of the yellow plum season. There is plenty of water, which can fully supply them with nutrients. There is little sunlight, which will not damage their bodies. So the spores gradually grow and split into new bodies at a certain period. Such reproduction continues, forming velvet-like patches.</p>
<p>To prevent the reproduction and parasitism of fungi, the first is to keep the air dry, because the scarcity of water can make it impossible for them to maintain life; the second is to have sufficient sunlight. Probably at about 70 degrees Celsius, they will not be able to survive. In short: As long as you get more sunlight, the fungi will naturally be eliminated.</p>

<p>(10) A Father's Heart</p>
<p>This is really an opportunity! Although for five or six years, he has come here every day to pick up his daughter, he always calculates the time very accurately, and sees Mei Bao dismissed from class as soon as he arrives. Even if he comes earlier, he has never encountered rain, and he has never come as early as today. Therefore, he has never seen Mei Bao attending class.</p>
<p>He straightened the blue cloth gown he was wearing, put down his trouser legs, and, with a heart beating violently, slowly walked forward.</p>
<p>Outside the corridor is the playground, and on the inside are a row of long windows. Inside the windows is the classroom.</p>
<p>The classroom was as quiet as if there was no one inside, except for a teacher in his thirties who was standing on the podium and talking. Begonia boldly approached the glass and quietly looked inside.</p>
<p>There were about thirty students inside. Half of them on the east side were bowing their heads and writing at their desks. Half of them on the west side were raising their heads and listening attentively to the teacher.</p>
<p>"... Although English grammar is far less difficult than French and German, if you don't remember it carefully, you will never be able to write English well..." The teacher lowered his head and thought for a while. "Now, let me test you. Zhou Qiyuan, give me an Auxiliary Verb!"</p>

<h3>Electric Buzzer Instead of Horn</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>New things in the American army are really emerging endlessly. In addition to using loudspeakers to amplify the sound of bugles blowing reveille, recently, the headquarters of the 174th Cavalry Regiment has used electric buzzers to wake up soldiers who are still in a sweet dream. This kind of "horn" is slightly the same as the one used on cars, saving time and effort, and the effect is great. In this way, in the future, the horn used for reveille in the army may be eliminated.</p>
<p>War</p>
<h3>New Escort Warships</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>British naval authorities, based on secret intelligence, know that Germany has six hundred new submarines participating in the Battle of the Atlantic. But Britain is confident, because she is rushing to build a large number of strong small warships, specially used for escorting convoys and dealing with submarines. These small warships have been carefully designed to withstand the storms and waves of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Small warships are simple and strong, easy and quick to build, and cost only one-tenth of a destroyer. The installation of the ship has no waste at all, even a small part must have its use. Fifty or sixty sailors per ship is enough. The length of the ship is half of a destroyer, the displacement is four hundred tons, and the speed is 20 to 25 nautical miles per hour.</p>
<p>Although small warships have fewer emplacements, lower speeds, and thinner armor, they are also much cheaper to build. The cost of a destroyer can build almost twelve small warships. The issue of quantity is very important in escorting and dealing with submarines.</p>
<p>Small warships are equipped with two 4-inch cannons, four anti-aircraft machine gun emplacements, and two mine launchers. Due to the small size of the ship, the target for submarines is also smaller, so the possibility of being hit is also smaller.</p>
<p>There are now eighty small warships under construction in Canada, and it is said that the British headquarters will rush to build three hundred more at an alarming rate.</p>

<h3>Frozen Sleep to Replace Anesthetics</h3>
<p>— Jie Quan</p>
<p>The New York World's Fair once demonstrated the strange event of "frozen sleep": a girl wearing thin underwear lay in a box full of ice cubes, gradually losing consciousness, as if she had frozen to death. After a while, people removed the ice cubes, and the girl slowly woke up.</p>
<p>Dr. G.H. Parker, a professor of animal behavior at Harvard University in the United States, recently published an article in a scientific journal, advocating that surgeons should use the method of frozen sleep instead of anesthetics when performing surgery to make patients lose consciousness. Because, he said, using anesthetics to make patients fall asleep often damages their nerves. As for using the method of frozen sleep, it can not only avoid the above shortcomings, but also be beneficial to the patient.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Parker, the frozen sleep method has long been applied in Harvard laboratories, and he has experimented on various animals. He feels that this method can also be applied to humans. The patient's body is surrounded by ice packs and rubber rings, and ice water circulates in it. The doctor gradually lowers the patient's body temperature until they enter a state of suspended animation, and then performs the incision. When the surgery is over, the patient's body is slowly warmed up.</p>
<p>Dr. Parker also said that frozen sleep also has considerable therapeutic power for malignant tumors, so when cutting out malignant tumors, the frozen sleep method should be used to replace anesthetics. After the patient undergoes frozen sleep, the body will not feel any discomfort at all, and some people have seen improvements in their health after trying frozen sleep for a considerable period of time.</p>

<h3>A Casual Discussion of "Martial Actors" on Shanghai's Stages (1)</h3>
<p>— Sui Jingchun</p>
<p>Recently, the martial actors in Shanghai's theaters are the most complete in terms of talent at the Great Stage and the Co-op Stage, followed by the New Tianchan Theater and the Carlton Theater. Golden stage only has one martial actress, Yan Shishan, who is extremely popular. Xiao San Mazi specializes in playing Guan Yu plays, and although there are one or two martial actors, they are all second or third rate, without much reputation. However, martial actors are divided into long-robe and short-fighting types. People like He Yueshan and Li Chunlai in the past were all good at short-fighting plays; they were certainly capable of long-robe plays, but in order to show the special characteristics of short-fighting, they were often unwilling to perform them, so as not to lose their reputation. Today's Gai Jiaotian is also second to none among short-fighting martial actors. His performance of "Evil Tiger Village" can be called unparalleled. Only Bai Yukun in previous years could still compete with Gai in this play. Now that Gai is old at the age of four, he is unable to perform due to illness, and Yukun is drifting and down and out, even more different than before. As for those who are good at long-robe martial actors, we should recommend Yang Xiaolou, Shang Heyu and others. Today's Li Wanchun, Li Xiaochun, (it is said that after Xiao Chunqiu cools down, he will join Tianchan) and Yang Ruiting, Bai Yukun, etc. are all outstanding talents. (Now Bai and Yang are both old and not as spectacular as before). Today, in the martial actor industry, many specialize in short-fighting, but all martial actors, if they do not have special skills, will not be respected. Otherwise, it is difficult to have a place. Now I will write about the martial actors who have a reputation on the current stages in this city one by one, which I think is what the average drama lover would like to hear! However, omissions are inevitable. In addition, the Shanghai Drama School has many young children, only ten years old, who specialize in martial actor plays, short-fighting and armed, and are proficient in everything. Their skills are very impressive and they are promising talents. I will omit their names because I cannot remember them, but it is also worth introducing them to the readers. I will add a note here.</p>
<p>Wang Yingwu He came to Shanghai with Gao Qingkui and performed at Tianchan, hanging up the second plaque. His popularity was so strong that he overwhelmed Gao, which can also be said to be Wang's most popular period. Later, because he was often enthusiastic with the opposite sex, his skills regressed without progress, and he fell into a slump. Although he is now a basic actor at Carlton, looking back at the past, I believe he is not without feeling. However, his skills are indeed not ambiguous and can be watched, compared with Carlton's newly hired female performers Dong Xia and Dong Ming as pillars, his plays are not performed every night due to the repertoire.</p>
<p>Li Zhonglin Li Zhonglin, formerly known as Xiao Xiao Gui Yuan, took over the role of Sun Wukong in "Journey to the West" at the Great Stage after Zhang Yipeng stopped performing, and continued to perform "The Legend of the Immortal Swordsman" until now. His reputation has not diminished. According to Li's skills, he has a lot of hard work, and he has also stayed in Harbin, Liaoning and other ports for several years, which has made his progress more apparent. Now it is even more magical. Although his appearance is not very flattering, his height is outstanding, like a jade tree facing the wind, so he is convenient and lively in all actions in martial dramas. This is a major reason for his advantage, and it is also something that other martial actors cannot match. Plays such as "Purple Bamboo Forest", "Killing Four Gates", and "Lin Chong's Night Flight" are indeed worth watching many times, but if he plays long-robe plays, his appearance is unsightly, so I dare not compliment him.</p>

<h3>Flowers of Blood and Jade</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 12 As Helpless as Ning Wuzi</p>
<p>Zhou Yuji heard that Zhang Lie's words were not unreasonable, so he gathered his troops, still having one thousand several hundred people. Because there were no bandits at the east gate, he opened the east gate and charged out from the east gate. In the middle of the night, he could not distinguish the terrain, but only retreated to a deserted place. Looking back at the city of Daizhou, the white smoke and firelight reflected in the sky were all red, and the fire was raging. Thinking of the tragic slaughter of bandits there, Zhou Yuji felt a pang of sadness in his heart on his horse, and with a "wow", he opened his mouth and spit out two drops of fresh blood, almost falling from the saddle. Xu Jing supported him from the side. After running for several miles, the ambush soldiers in the forest suddenly attacked, dividing Zhou Yuji's troops into two halves. It was Full Sky Star Jia Yang. Zhou Yuji, Xu Jing, and Zhang Lie fought desperately, breaking through the siege. However, Fan City was already submerged in the chaotic army and could not go together. He was hit by three knives, but he still waved the knife in his hand and fought the bandit soldiers to the death. He killed several more bandit soldiers in a row. Jia Yang caught up, and Fan Cheng's strength was exhausted. The horse he was sitting on was stabbed by Jia Yang, so he had to dismount and fight hard. Knowing that he could not escape, he was unwilling to be humiliated by the bandits, so he drew his knife and committed suicide. Zhou Yuji and others fled for their lives all night before arriving at Ningwu Pass. ××× There was a guerrilla Wang Weiguo leading a thousand soldiers stationed there. He had long heard of the police report from Daizhou and repeatedly wanted to go to rescue, but he did not dare to leave his post far away because the pass was empty. He often looked forward to it in his heart. Hearing that Daizhou had been lost and General Zhou Yuji had retreated here in defeat, he hurriedly led his troops out of the pass to meet Zhou Yuji and enter the city. Wang Weiguo had a dark complexion, a tall body, and great strength. He was in his prime and was known for his bravery. He was someone that Zhou Yuji had promoted. When they met, they were both distressed. Zhou Yuji immediately ordered Xu Jing, Zhang Lie, and Wang Weiguo to guard the pass to prevent the bandits from taking advantage of the victory to attack. He took a few servants and ran to his private residence, dismounted and took off his armor, and went to visit his old mother. Zhou Yuji's mother was already over seventy years old, with white hair all over her head, tooth decay, and a hunched back. That day, she was sitting in the middle hall with her daughter-in-law, Liu, and her grandson, thinking of her son. The old lady also knew that the bandits were rampant and would come to invade sooner or later, so her son was stationed in Daizhou and had no time to return to greet her and see her meals, but she did not know that Daizhou had been besieged by the bandits. Although Zhou Yuji's wife, Liu, knew about it, Zhou Yuji's family letter also entrusted her to comfort the old mother, but she was afraid that her mother-in-law would be frightened, so she temporarily concealed the news. Unexpectedly, Zhou Yuji returned in defeat, and this matter could not be concealed sooner or later.</p>

<h3>British Embassy Hosts Benefit Song and Dance Performance</h3>
<p>The British Embassy plans to hold a song and dance gala in the near future, including the British song and dance troupe that previously performed at the Lyceum and foreign celebrities from this city. The purpose of this event is to raise funds to help Shanghai's refugee children. The embassy believes that the theater is too small to accommodate a large number of audiences, so it plans to hold the event at Zhangyuan Yuhuayuan on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
