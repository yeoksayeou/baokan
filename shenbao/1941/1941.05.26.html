<h3>荷特號沉失與英德海上角逐</h3>
<p>使英方航運極感困擾的德國海上剽襲，其所運用的工具一向只有飛機和潛艇，德方大型軍艦儘管有時也出海從事行動，較屬無足重輕，尤其自希爾上將號被噸位武裝均遠較薄弱的英巡艦擊沉之後，更造成一般輕視德海軍的觀念，認爲一九一六年裘德蘭的戰役在此度大戰中殆無重演可能。但是此次格林蘭附近的海戰，德新型主力艦俾士麥號初試身手，竟把英方噸位佔全世界第一的巡洋戰鬥艦荷特號擊沉，證明德軍在大西洋施行威脅的工具已由飛機潛艇廣大到軍艦，此役之使人震驚雖與斯比上將之役相同，其影響當更遠爲重大。</p>
<p>在目前歐戰角逐中，陸軍暫時已無用武之地，雙方所着意爭奪的却是海上的覇權。英國而能長此保持海上優勢，在消極方面足以保衛英倫及其海外交通，在積極方面可以發揮對德封鎖的效果：如果這一優勢竟被擊破，則不惟英帝國將遭支解，不待德軍侵襲，英倫已有遭受縊斃之虞。此次胡德號的沉沒，是否即屬英方海上威權發生裂痕的表徵，實爲一般人士心目中所亟待解答的問題。茲先就此一戰役本身略加檢討。</p>
<p>胡德號的沉沒，在英國白屬重大損失，但其意義並不十分嚴重，該艦噸位雖大，艦齡已老，其較俾十麥號大三分之一的噸位也只能供給與之僅相匹敵的武裝和速度，何况相差廿年的艦齡差別已是判定兩艦性能的優劣。另就荷特號沉沒經過來看，其沉失之速與艦員死亡之衆足以證明英方所公布的彈藥庫中彈以致爆炸的報告確屬事實，這與其歸功於德艦作戰的優良，到無寗謂爲出於某種程度的偶然，因爲直到德艦獲勝之後德方尙未能確言所擊沉的即爲荷特號。這一大而無當的軍艦是屬於巡洋戰艦一類，照例不能不犧牲裝甲以增强武力和速度，較比三萬一千噸的伊利莎伯女皇號級或三萬三千五百噸的納爾遜級戰艦裝甲竟薄至一吋或二吋，這大概是胡德號主要弱點所在，與斯比上將號沉沒情形正同。更就武力而言，荷特號所裝八尊十五吋砲並不是戰鬥艦最合理想的武器、最近英方甫經下水的喬治五世號所裝十四吋砲十尊，無論砲彈發射力或貫澈力都比較八尊十五吋砲優越得多。如果德艦所遭遇不是古老的荷特號而是這一類的新型主力艦，其結果將大不同。英海軍的無比威權一向是建立在其艦艇的超越力量與多面性能及其優良傳統上面的，這一點直到此際並未發生何等改變。</p>
<p>此次格林蘭海戰，在性質上可斷定其爲遭遇戰，因爲主力接戰顯爲德艦所力求避免，其主要任務不在於對壘而在於剽襲。以僅有的幾隻主力艦輕涉遠洋，英勇固無可疑，所冒危險却也極大，在遼闊的洋面隨時有遭受英海軍邀擊的可能；而且一度受創，絕對安然返還本國的海軍根據地，以視英方在大西洋東西兩岸都具有修理便利者自不可同日語。目前德方的主力艦除却俾斯麥號及其同級的鐵爾必茲號而外，另外兩艘二萬六千噸的香霍斯特和納森諾號經英空軍迭加轟炸之後，究竟破壞到何等程度仍爲一謎；其從一九三七開始建造的兩艘四萬噸主力艦，據一般推測多認爲業已下水，是其實力已距離未遭破壞前的義法海軍水準不遠，自屬未可輕侮，不過以英方實力與之周旋，仍屬遊刃有餘。</p>
<p>目前英方海上所患並不在實力的强弱與少數艦艇的沉失而在於戰綫的分散，英海軍目前所負任務之繁重，殆非已經任何時期所可比擬，保護海外航路及各個屬領已極繁難，目前地中海與克里特島的血戰更吸引着英海軍最大部分的實力，德方之乘此時機發展大西洋攻勢原屬理有固然，因爲納粹艦艇並沒有另外任務要去擔負。假如地中海之戰再繼續僵持或竟不幸惡化，則大西洋方面所受威脅亦必隨而增重。格林蘭一戰對英國的意義不僅在於巨艦的沉失，可盧的到在於這一多面攻勢將使英感覺棘手。但如果干地亞之戰和伊拉克形勢能迅速好轉，則地中海的海軍實力儘可抽出一部分增強大西洋的防禦，一切自當大爲改觀。</p>
<p>美國此際正臨到重大決定的前夜，這一海戰又適在美國保護下的格林蘭島附近洋面發生，這對於美方官民無疑是一個重大刺激，且更足加强羅斯福的明日演說中的積極因素。大西洋形勢愈嚴重，美國愈將迅速分担英國作戰責任。荷特號的沉失是德海軍的重大勝利，其影響所及却會使德國成功的前途愈益渺茫。</p>

<h3>港貢兩地源源接濟　米價有跌無漲　米市時受操縱不足憑信　貢米確實售價尙未披露</h3>
<p>昨據米業界消息、處洽卿前在滬時、曾代某某等雜糧行向仰光直接訂購五月期貨小絞米八千噸（即八萬包）、現正首途運滬、本月底或下月初準可到達、惟由伺輪承裝、現尙求知悉、本埠食糧存底、巳較過去任何時期為充足，且公共租界工部局辦理之平價港米、又源源運滬、而法公董局所辦之貢米、亦將决第抵埠、不但本市民食、可保無虞、其售價之繼續下跌、亦屬意料中事、</p>
<p>貢米售價　尙無確訉</p>
<p>法公董局直接向越南政府所訂購之西貢米、首批准於月內抵滬、外傳有二十萬包之多、據平明社記者探悉、的在十萬包之譜、而巳裝運來滬者、確爲五萬包、至於貢米售價、上週沙麗（Sarly）召集各雜糧行商議承銷時、亦未明白表示、僅允給予手續費百分之八、惟據一般人推測、貢米將來發售時之售價、恐與公共租界工部局平價港米售價不相上下、又法國航務公司之霞飛將軍號輪、業於昨日下午二時牛由西貢駛抵本埠、計載來貢米三萬包、記者父向另一方面探悉、現一部份米號、巳獲得當局更廉之洋米、故有開價一百元出售者、</p>
<p>滬地所需　源源接濟</p>
<p>法公董局目前雖僅向越南方面先訂購貢米十萬包、是項進口貢米、完全委由達孚等三洋行合組織之進口委員會全權辦理、法公董局則處於監督地位、而越南方面亦由出口委員會負責辦理、由越南政府督促之、此後當能如滬地所需、定可按期源源運埠、絕無中斷之虞、</p>

<p>過磅退款　今日開始</p>
<p>現下向立基洋行訂購平價港米行號、共計七百四十三家、據祥茂洋行統計、至上週六爲止、大致已付款完畢、至於上週各米行號前往堆棧提貨如每包重量不滿二百二十四磅者、今日起可持三義及泡立生台維兩洋行之過磅重量單、前往祥茂洋行退款、限期爲三日、至本月二十八日截止、</p>

<h3>春季的蒔花會  愛農</h3>
<p>上海時花會舉辦的第六十五决春季蒔花會，昨在跑馬廳大厦舉行。鮮花排列成的甬道，把筆者欣欣然引人了會塲，兩閒大廳，分列左右，從木牌上的指示，知道右廳是陳列着餐桌瓶花等，左廳陳列花堆蔬菜等。筆者踏進了右首的一所，因爲這閒是蒔花會的精華啊</p>
<p>一踏入這間大廳，最先觸入眼簾的是兩大座花山，靠壁矗立着，似乎巍巍然像廟宇中的四大金剛般引人注目。這兩座花山的花是由工部局各大公園彙集而成，而由膠州公園曹德生佈置的，背景是一幅蔚藍色的布幔，而五色續紛的花用花盆堆砌而成，五光十色，燦爛奪目，黃和紅，白與綠，紫和靑相互掩映着，襯托着，色彩配列得異常鮮明，層决佈置得井井有條，似乎在眼中充滿了一種說不出的愉快。</p>
<p>餐桌的佈置，佔着這閒大應的一大半，這次增加了不少，可分爲宴席式，家常式和茶點式三類。其中榮獲宴席式的第一獎是「釣罷歸來大舉宴客」的一桌，桌布用魚網鋪成，正中放着一盆睡蓮和蘆荻，裝成一幅水景，桌上完全放着水產物，富有西洋的色彩，輕快，精巧，是這一桌的特點。</p>
<p>這此中國會員周瘦鵑比仍把東方情調的盆栽參加，而榮獲嘉杜和特別大獎杯。據會中執事人吿我，因爲那彼德葛蘭大銀朴，先已獎與堆疊花山的川品人，而周氏的出品父實在也够得上得這獎杯，沒奈何便由會長兼評判嘉杜利氏臨時辦了一隻大銀杯來，獎與周氏，作爲特別獎，像這樣的另眼相看，的確是非常的榮譽。這决的出品，仍分列三桌，而且仍在原來的地位。正中的一桌是鋪着嫩綠鵝黃圖案的錦毯，奪目異常。桌的中央是一隻明代舊盆中種着一株古木　嶸的六月雪，在龍爪般的根巢旁坐着一尊古達摩像，頓覺古氣盎然。旁邊是一盆牛懸崖的瑪瑙石榴，榦皮巳很蒼老，但滿樹着花，花大葉茂，分外難得。左首也是一盆縣崖的金茉莉，芳香撲鼻，前面有一古淺瓷盆的野竹，葉葉靑翠，枝枝挺秀，分外的有精神。還有一隻乾白的水盆中，兩塊滿綴靑芬的靈石，石壁間一舟橫渡，題名是「春水船如天上坐」，眞是富有詩情畫意的傑作。右首的一桌是小品，架中放着各式玲瓏的小古盆，種着小冬靑，小榆樹，小六月雪，小月季花，小海棠，小爬山虎，都是以小見長，在手掌中可供淸玩。其中有一隻二寸半的橢圓盆中佈置成竹林茅舍，幽雅可愛。在這一櫥架中色彩的明顯，佈置的精緻，在會中別創一格。架旁是一隻靑花　瓷深方盆，配着一株懸崖形的大迎春，姿勢的優美，得木曾有。有一位西方老紳士見了，幽默地對他的朋友說。。「我願立一遺囑，死後葬於此中。」也可見他老人家一種愛之若在的情緒了。左首的一桌，矮几上有九種中型盆栽，以漢磚盆中「竹林七賢」爲主體，自　淸趣。更有古本冬靑，懸崖榆樹，紅白杜鵑，興金銀花柳穿魚陪襯着，有的以色調勝，有的以姿熊勝，几旁有一名手楊彭年氏所製六角形白砂盆，種着一本蒼老的三角楓，結子纍纍，總是幾十年的老本。欣賞完了周氏的出品，頓覺中國盆栽的名貴，可惜其中的眞味，不易爲西洋人使所能體會到的。</p>
<p>轉了一個灣，在西洋色彩中父顯出了東方情調的盆景，原來是孔志淸氏的出品。孔氏是水石專家，所以出品中，以水石於盆量各占一半，佈置得高高低低，其中以標着「紫竹林」的一盆，最爲古樸，在一個深　的石洞中，站羞一尊白石的觀音大士像，石洞上栽着一株虬龍般的古柏，洞旁滿植紫竹。盆上還貼着如蟻一般的標籤，原來是無聲居士所書的「心經」，格外覺得佛敎的威嚴。還有一盆「漁樂圖」，也是引人注目的，在一隻淺水盆中，流水蜿蜓，三艇泊岸，彷彿一幅漁家樂的古畫。更有一盆「香雪海」，是用十多株六月雪配栽着，多而不亂，確是難得，而且滿樹都是白花，樹間小溪橫流，木橋一座，橫架兩岸，兩旁茅屋櫛比，茅草芋綿，充滿着鄉村的風味。其他的小盆栽，水石約有四十盆左右。</p>
<p>再轉到左首的大廳，三大座花堆，一大盆一大盆有規律的草花，和其他各種奇花異卉，雖是很美觀，但實在不配我們的胃口，可引起西洋士女的注意。今年照例有蔬菜展覽，可惜這些外人所食的果蔬，對於我富然是門外漢，</p>
<p>這樣走馬看花地走出會塲，已足足有三小時之久，不過在鼻中似乎還沾着些餘查，而在腦中留有一個深刻的印象—東方的美和西洋的美畢竟是不同的呀！</p>
<h3>法租界鐵門仍閉　南市入封鎖狀態　無法歸家者均露宿街頭民國路等處仍嚴密搜查</h3>

<p>南市封鎖蔬菜飛漲</p>
<p>失者、厥爲居於南市而服務處所在租界者、因此而無法工作、或無法歸家者、不下千數百人、故鐵門內外、終日人頭擠擠、探視動靜、其次爲南市之菜農、平日担負前來租界出售、昨日即無從如願、以致租界各處之小菜塲把攤販、頓形减少、售價隨之激增、尤以發芽豆·黃豆芽·　豆芽爲最、因此項蔬菜、十九在南市發芽、（平日一角可售者昨竟漲起一倍以上）、他如本地貨（靑菜·韮菜·蠶豆等）、因南市無法運出、幸北市可到、故僅漲起四五成之　、</p>

<h3>歐戰對於英國銀行業務之影響　凌崇眞譯</h3>
<p>銀行業在戰時之遭遇如何？所負之使命如何？我銀行界人士雖已飽嘗戰爭滋味二年半左右，似尙屬一未知數之問題。試讀本文，返顧我國，尤其上海，更不能不以此問題之至今尙屬未知數而駭異。質言之：吾人對本問題，照理已是「應毋庸議」，不必提出。然至今似尙有提出之必要，豈能以「此也彼也」自解之？是則該文令吾人警惕者何在？想讀者已不會有見仁見智之不同者歟？　（編者）</p>
<p>戰爭開始，英國政府即在各方面作種種行動，對銀行體制更有應付任何事變之準備；比非誇大之言，蓋有種種事實足資證明。一九三八年戰爭危機漸决顯露時，英國銀行界即集合組織代表團，磋商應付一切可能事變之辦法；該代表團所貢獻之計劃，在戰事進行業已十八個月之今日觀之，更覺其妥善週全。與德國交戰之初，以後將有若佝進展？頗難逆料，故一切計劃，均須從最惡劣之方面着想；幸而直至今日，只需應用該項計劃之一小部份而已。</p>
<p>在國家銀行總行及各支行之實際工作方面，預料中之兩項困難，爲連輸停頓之可能性及因被轟炸以至各項紀錄之毀滅；至於大量男職員之被召入伍，早在意料中；並已以機械代替人力而補救之。</p>
<p>轟炸中照常辦公</p>
<p>英國五大銀行之總行均在倫敦，在平時各職員往返辦公室之時間的需一小時。德機轟炸目標，不出意料之外，均集中於倫敦之交涌綫上，是故有不少交通站及分綫不時感受威脅而暫停工作。銀行辦公時間乃改爲出上午十時至下午二時，星期六日則由上午九時半至十二時，同時仍需設法使各職員能依時抵達辦公室。</p>
<p>關於使各職員能依時抵達辦公室之最妥善辦法，意見不一，今所實行者有一。各銀行之總行及英倫銀行之房舍，均爲炸彈不能洞穿之建築物。某些銀行掌管鑰匙之職員，即住宿其內，另籌妥善辦法，以供給彼等之伙食，幷輪流留駐，使每一職員每隔若干夜即可回家一次，與家人叙首。另一辦法爲租貨載客汽車，使各職員可以直接往返，此等客車在倫敦市內各地及郊外地帶爲出發點，每晨九時以前即可抵達城內，直至一日之工作完畢，乃復送各職員返家。</p>
<p>此兩項辦法均頗完善，惟費用之鉅，自所難免，各銀行爲每一職員之用款，不論朝出暮歸或留駐行內，每星期大的需一英鎊，不過唯此方可保證每一不可少之男女職員，均可依時在職。</p>
<p>至於在倫敦及各省之支行，直至目前爲止，尙不需實行此種辦法，因大部份職員均居住不遠，而能依時辦公。</p>
<p>維持票據交換機能</p>
<p>銀行代表團所不能不深思熟慮者，厥爲在戰事發生後之支票交換問題，關於此點，彼等所決斷之步驟，堪稱有史以來最新奇之行動，即除各總行及其他一二靠近英倫銀行之銀行所有票據交換用具外（此等用具存於英倫銀行之地窖內）決計將倫教票據交換所遷至離倫敦的一百四十六里之史托安特蘭特城（Stoke-on-Trent）</p>
<p>此决遷移係有最週全之組織，而行動上絕無遷延或陣碍。在戰爭開始後之一個星期六日，倫教票據交換所即暫停營業，以使將所有設備及用具，包括七百架加法機（Odding　Macoine）遷至新址，準備下星期一繼續辦公之用。在進行上整整有條，各有關方面均稱滿意。</p>
<p>倫敦票據交換所之遷址，其不便之處，絕無預期之甚，每一交易之整個紀錄，均以機器印就副本，此外更運用其他現代化之方法，使所有寄存之支票，縱在　　中遺失，仍司立即處理該項業務，雖然內收據略遲兩三日，以致客戶提存支票稍有稽遷，各銀行尙無感覺仟何不便之處，除在銀行結單之運輸數字下，增加若干項目外，幷無其他不良之點。</p>
<p>轟炸不能阻止業務進行</p>
<p>票據交換固藉機械之運用有所保障，而最近十年內其他機器之普遍應用，另有重要之成績。在倫敦及各鄕村之銀行支行，多受炸彈之洗禮，此乃盡人皆知之事實，惟至今未聞有一被炸之支行整天停止營業者。</p>
<p>圖記及簽名之副本早已存於穩妥地點；一切交易紀錄之副本，亦可隨時獲得。當某一支行被炸，次日即在最近之另一支行，或在其他銀行之支行內，繼續營業，故無論在物質方面損失如何龐大，英國之銀行業務，始終照常進行。</p>
<p>有一頗爲奇異之事實，擬在此一提，即大多數銀行支行之建築雖巳毀滅無存，而保險箱及地下堅固室，均絲毫無損，有時因水管之破裂，此等貯藏客戶之有價誰券，地契，及各該行之現金及重要紀錄之地下堅固室，偶爾爲水侵入，不過至今該項證劵及地契等，米聞有受損毀者。</p>
<p>職員入伍後之補缺</p>
<p>在動筆書就此文之時，英國各銀行大約有百分之二十男職員自動或被徵入伍，因而不能照常工作，苟非因年來機械發達，銀行靑年職員之人數，已漸次减少，則此次因戰事而不能不離職之職員數目，當更可觀。</p>
<p>各入伍職員之空缺，半以十六七歲之靑年，半以女子補充。以前因結婚而辭職之女職員，有不少允在戰爭期內復職，是故現有銀行職員之實際數目，與前無甚差異。富有銀行業務上普通經騐之女子，大部份使之充任出納員，彼等亦頗能勝任愉快，在大多數支行內之出納工作，包括各種不同之銀行交易，故非有特殊幹練之人材，不易應付也。</p>
<p>基本變遷與特殊措施</p>
<p>在銀行業務上此决戰爭所招致之基本變遷，爲一切國外滙兌交易之實際消除，滙兌率已不存在而一切交易必需經過英倫銀行，該行有權決定每一項次金過戶是否於國家有利，故各銀行在倫敦之國外滙兌支部，已暫停營業，所有因此解職之幹練人員，復可分配在其他重要之職位。實際上英國各銀行已實行分散幹練人員在國內各部，以便在事故發生時，有熟練之人員主持一切。</p>
<p>各銀行之主要營業在倫敦者，業已另備適當房舍，使一旦辦公處不能應用時，即可立時遷移。此等後補房舍有爲地下室，內有現代化之冷氣設備，並有絕對安全之地位，在事變發生時，即可遷入，實際上各銀行不常應用之紀錄等業已移入，以策安全。</p>
<p>在戰爭期內借貸之工作大减，自在意料中，信用放款之供給，只限於對國家抗戰有利之途徑，銀行貸款之性質爲之一變，抵銷交易所有價證劵之借貸，業已大部份淸償，且有不少商業之活動，因戰事而收縮，故信用放款之需求，亦隨之而大减。</p>
<p>新有價證劵之發行，久已停止。各銀行均與國家給養部及航空機械製造部密切合作，主持一切對於　用資本，原料，機械工具及其他各需要之信用放款事宜。</p>
<p>例如一戰具製造廠需款之時，卽可向該處地方銀行之總經理申請。國家之給養部及航空機械製造部均有指定分部與銀行保持密切之接觸。每接收一申請書時，立即發出合同一份，交借款者手收。此兩部之權限甚大，凡管理欠善之工廠，可被封閉，另由該兩部或發給信用放款之銀行委派代表接辦。</p>
<p>各銀行信用放款之數目，受政府之命，比平時大為增加，為要供給國家抗戰之需求，因而發給私人工業之信用借款，尙在直接貨與政府者之外，其總數之大，可想而知，幸而各經營銀行者均能明瞭努力抗戰為第一目標，目因私人儲蓄，軍已變為政府發行之各種有假證劵，而多餘之營利稅達百分之一百，此種步驟，似亦不能避免、在戰爭開始時即頒行之百分之百營利稅，固為政治上之大舉動，惟私人營業方面，因此而日感困難，故在經濟觀點上視之，此實為一無課限制之障碍。</p>
<p>當然，政府每星期消耗之戰費，遠過於民衆認購公債等等之數目、彌補之辦法，為財政部向各銀行直接借款，以所謂國庫收據收據者（Treasny　Deposit　Receipts）爲抵柙條件，其總數至今約爲二五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇至三〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美鎊，利11／8％。在整個英國銀行存款之能力視之，此數目固不能算十分龐大，惟各銀行自然歡迎政府籌措還款之計劃，及較高之利息率，以减輕彼等之虧損，此種存款收據之增加，足使各銀行之低收益資產（Low　Earning　Assets）比例增高，而引起不安。</p>
<p>全國節的委員會正努力促使民衆盡力節的，以支持政府抗戰，此委員會之組織，頗類上决世界大戰時美國自由借貸團（LibertyLoan　Organizations）以各銀行爲有力之後盾，辦事精神甚佳。在英國各城之銀行經理及職員，均以大部份時間，在此項工作上努</p>
<p>至於銀行界對於抗戰之寬大而　國之態度，更可從彼等對於在軍隊服務各職員之待　證明之。英國海陸空軍之薪給均甚非薄，譬如一獨身兵士，每日只得五角，有妻子及其他負擔者，雖略有津貼，其數目亦非常有限，爲解決此薪給問題起見，各銀行決定補足在軍隊服務各職員之薪金，使之與在行內之薪金相等，此外該員並可向政府領取家庭之津貼，是以在軍隊內服務之職員可無內顧之憂而安心從事，同時知道彼等在銀行內之職位，戰　仍科保持。在銀行方面，固增加不少負擔，不過彼等視之爲彼等對於國家應有之一種貢獻。</p>
<p>總而言之，英國銀行事業正以堅强鎭靜之態度，應付戰爭，戰爭及因戰爭而招致之各種損失及毀滅，當非彼等所歡迎，不過，戰爭旣巳降臨，則彼等深知各富盡其本職。銀行客戶及顧客等亦能通力合作，對於辦公時間之縮短及其他一切不方便之處，從未稍發怨言。一言以蔽之，民衆之普通態度爲：「我儕旣受同一遭遇，必需共間努力，使之有最美滿之結果」。（譯自The　Borroughs　ClearingHouseFed．1941）</p>
<h3>第三期作風　YQ</h3>
<p>日本採行軍用票淸一色手段，並鉗制其他新發鈔後，中日貨幣戰爭，表面上似乎已經緩和，實際上却把戰塲從從通貨界搬到物價領域裏去罷了，道可說是中日貨幣戰爭第三期的開始。過去兩期，都在通貨界活動。第一期着重於偷天換日，妄圖以聯鈔等替代法幣。此策旣敗，乃移其目標於法幣購買力的破壞；此於今日在物價領域裹破壞法幣的目標雖依然一致，但其破壞手段，尙限於通貨。像套取外匯，像「華興券」之妄圖與法幣「同生共死」！這是第二期。迨指定華中是「軍用票流通區域」，並一反其「偷天換日」政策而對其他雜鈔不予支持起，日本對華的貨幣戰略，便不再對法幣實行正面攻擊，而從物價方面，開始其旁敲側擊的迂迴戰略了。現在，正在他試行這種戰略的時期；道是誰都應該特別注意的。</p>
<p>物價上漲雖非法幣價值跌落的結果，但是物價上漲的結果，却是法幣價値的跌落、這是公認的事實。中國法幣基礎旣强，又有英鎊美金做後盾；所以要正面破壞灶幣的購買力，只是徒勞無功。而且自從他嘗到了套取法幣外匯基金的滋味後，更一反其唯恐法幣匯價不跌的態度，而變為「唯恐法幣匯價不高」。因此他一方希望法幣滙價維持於較高水準，以便套購；另一方面却仍圖壓迫法幣的購買力，俾其獲得中國幣制上的佔領權，在這兩個相反的企圖中，便發現了這個從物價方面進攻的迂迴戰略了。</p>
<p>這戰略，日本是意外發現的。最初他不過想　制淪陷區物資以補　本國的不足；他一方以武力控制淪陷區物資的流通，一方則發行軍用票等雜鈔以便不付代價而獲得此項物資；淪陷區裏的商人懾於淫威，大都從高抬物價中去補救其損失。於是造成軍用票等對法幣慘厲跌價的局面。爲挽救軍用票等跌價，以謀滿足其充分搜購淪陷區物資的慾望計，於是開始高抬軍用票的價格。像犧牲在華的日元券，犧牲依附的各種雜鈔，擴大軍用票强制流通的機會，甚至故意製造軍用票的投機風潮等等，無非都以抬高軍用票價格爲共目的。</p>
<p>擴大軍用票强制流通機會的企圖雖依然失敗，但故意製造軍用票投機風潮的手段，却極爲維妙·他一面造成軍票價格暴漲的局面，去吸引那批喪心病在的投幾份子；一面在暴漲暴落的投機風潮中作鬼，使不能和法幣競爭的軍用栗，居然也有貴出法幣的時期，再設法撑住道種局面。暴漲暴落程度越大，吸引投機的可能也越大；投機者吸引越多，軍票的發行可能也越大，被他的吸收去的法幣也越多。因此軍票的流通範圍雖依然狹窄得可憐，但以其套購所得法幣量的增大，已可促成淪陷區物資的高漲。物價高漲，法幣購買力便無形抑低。而他則反在軍票漲價中可獲得更多的物資，同時却可避免影響法幣漲價東縛其套購法幣外匯的可能。</p>

<h3>啓事</h3>
<p>「論今日之勞工問題（下）」下期續刋</p>
<h3>看到聽到想到</h3>
<p>紡織　是日本國民經濟的生命綫。但是他的　棉，幾乎全賴美國。上週六，美國參議院已授權商業放軟公司收買棉花，同時又禁止棉花的一切商業買賣，直至戰後為止。此舉無異擴人對日禁運的範圍。握着日本咽喉的那隻巨掌，又添加了一分力量。</p>
<p>講到紡織業之與日本國民經濟的利害，又想起我過去所說的：這次中日大戰，在經濟上的　義，可當「棉花戰爭」看。第一個日人到中國來開辦的第一個工廠是紗廠，日本商品對華市塲經營最力的是紗布；九一八事變後日本高唱「日本工業中国農業」的用意，就要中國一面關閉紗廠，一面叫華農替日廠種棉。因為中國不答允，日本就親自動手，在一二八滬戰之初，把三友實業社用火燒掉；而該社當時正是華商棉業界最活躍的一員。該社後在杭州重振旗鼓，盛極一時的三角牌毛巾就是該廠出品。但在此决戰事中，日軍到杭第一舉就是攫取該廠，迫得該社現在不得不改營三友補丸。而這次戰事發生之初，正是中日紗業競爭最烈的時候。華北的華商紗廠，大都變了日本國籍；上海的申新押款事件，又閙得滿城風雨。戰事旣起，淪陷區裏產業受害最大的便是紗廠；英商紗廠也不能倖免。像跟戰事而突然盛銷的綸昌蔴紗，旋即被有背景的工潮，弄得進退兩難。淪陷區裏的物產，第一個被控制的，便是棉花。中國在西北實施的反封鎖政策，第一步就是禁止植棉和禁運棉花出境。現在日商正想以藍　紗來替代雙馬紗，可是美國此次變相禁棉出口，日本的紡織財閥，可够頭痛了。</p>
<p>米蛀蝨又在替米市注射空氣針了。他們正在擴大「購辦內運」的空氣，用以冲銷「洋米原源而來」的事實。希望同業和市民一致留意，又希望租界當局未雨綢繆，進一步管理米糧的移動，以保持當前米價政策的成功效果。</p>
<p>外行人不會揀貨，所以崇拜老牌；生意中人，於是亦唯牌子是問。然所謂老牌也者，不外乎墨守陳規，故步自封；比滑頭騙人的新牌果然好，但未必包括精益求精的成分在內。所以崇拜老脾，未始不就是崇拜不進步而己。</p>

<h3>靑年攝生法</h3>
<p>— 弓長</p>
<p>靑年時代發育旺盛，亦是人生最危險的時期，年齡之修短，身體之强弱，事業之成敗，皆在此期間決定。故靑年時期之　生尤爲重要。現略舉數條攝生法於下：</p>
<p>一，皮膚宜多得日光，每日宜以冷水摩擦全身，少着衣服，以學成耐寒之習慣。</p>
<p>二，肺臟宜於每日淸晨作深呼吸一次，以防肺病。居室之門窗，書夜宜開放之，以流通空氣。</p>
<p>三，肌肉宜習勞，時常學習各種運動，以增淮肌肉之發達。並官矯正脊骨之彎曲，坐立之姿勢尤宜注意。</p>
<p>四，消化器必須養成良好之習慣，每日除三餐外，不宜食零食。食不過飽，而宜細嚼。每朝夕各刷牙刮舌苔一次。每日大便一次，須有定時（以淸晨爲佳）。若便秘則食香蕉生梨等水菓。</p>
<p>五，宜戒烟酒，烟酒內含有毒質，能侵入腦髓，心臟，血液等。麻木其功用，變壞其本質，切宜戒之。</p>
<p>六，切忌賭博，博賭乃不正當行爲。能使人精神上養成僥倖放蕩之習慣。在身體上，光陰上，經濟上皆受莫大之害。凡我靑年，極宜戒除。</p>
<p>七，靑年之生殖慾最爲旺盛，其外腎所生之精液中，有丕耳明者，非僅爲蕃衍人類之用，亦欲借此發達其腦力體力，以及心肺胃腸肝腎等內臟之用也。然靑年往往不知其可貴，搖動之，耗費之，枯竭之：犯手淫之病，此病可謂慢性自殺。尤其在這萬惡的孤島上，最易受各界之誘惑而犯此病，而予畢生以最大打擊。凡我靑年，切勿犯此，不然，前途危矣！</p>
<p>靑年攝生之法，不勝枚舉。今祇舉其一二，願靑年們好自爲之。</p>
<h3>一種經濟便利與衛生的鞋子</h3>
<p>— 祉</p>
<p>在現在的環境中，我覺得我們的一切—無論其關於衣食住行的那一方面，都應當適合三個條件；便是經濟，便利和衛生，但是這三個條件，很不容易做到，往往適合了經濟之道。便感到不便利，能够便利，却又不合衛生，極難於盡善盡美。</p>
<p>現在，我感覺到一種鞋子，恰恰能合於這三個條件的，說出來，也並沒有什麽希奇，便是布鞋。說到鞋子，原可分爲皮鞋布鞋和橡膠鞋三種，在這三種中，皮鞋價格最貴，一雙普通貨，總須三十多元，雖然堅牢，然至多亦不過用上二年餘，而且皮不透氣，久穿皮鞋，容易發生濕毒，更不用說皮鞋原料，舶來品居多了！其次說到布鞋，布鞋有綢面呢羢面布面三類，底有皮製布製毡製等，論輕便，當然算皮底，論吸潮，要推毡底布底，論耐用，毡底布底也不在皮底之下，至於說到橡膠鞋，雖晴雨都可用，似乎比較便利，然而不透氣，潮濕非常利害，穿了一天，到晚上脫去，往往襪底如着水，對於衛生，最不相宜，粽上以觀，布鞋最爲適宜。然而我們試看現在社會上的一般人們，都喜穿皮鞋，而尤以靑年爲甚，固然，靑年的審美思想是比較發達的，這原無足深責，然而在此國難嚴重的當兒，我們何忍再不節儉些呢？所以我希望大家多穿穿經濟便利而父合於　生的布鞋。</p>
<h3>應當飲茶嗎？</h3>
<p>— 席夏</p>
<p>「飲茶」的習慣在我國社會中是極普遍的，居家無事，飲茶遺懷，來客敬茶以爲禮，而目窮鄉僻壤都有「茶肆」的開設，由此，可見其風之盛；不過飲茶對於身體的影響，主張各異，嗜茶者認爲茶能扶助食物的消化，促進食物利用的功效，所以主　飲茶；反對者認爲茶中含有「單寗酸」，可使蛋白質凝固，阻止氮素的吸收，旣然有害，而且浪費，因此提倡飲白開水，而反對飲茶；各執一辭，使一般人不能斷定孰是孰非，所以飲茶這問題實在是應當加以研究的。</p>
<p>神農氏的本草上曾有過這樣的記述：「茶味苦，飲之使人益思，少臥，輕身，明目。」就他成分來說，含有蛋白質，茶精（Thein），單寗（Tannicacid），芳香油（Enential），和阿米諾酸等。在功效上茶可以解渴提神，確能助長消化，促進生長，是利尿劑可使體內毒素排出，又能漂白病理上色素的分解物，可稱爲生理的「凈血劑」。不過單寗酸對於蛋白質確有阻止消化的作用，所以在飲用牛乳或富有多量蛋白質的食物後，最好是不要立即飲茶。最後，我們可以知道茶是可以飲用的，不過以不太濃或太多爲相宜。</p>
<h3>値得提倡的土布窗帘</h3>
<p>— 毓俊</p>
<p>近幾年來，一般的窗帘用品大率都是採用舶來品，取其質料細緻，染色鮮艷而不退。然而就這一項，每年的漏巵，怕也就不在少數了。</p>
<p>其實我國所產的土布却是極好的窗帘原料。因爲一年四季中，除了一個夏季，需要薄質的之外，其他三季，所需要的都是質車下垂，不因微風而飄動的窗帘。這一個條件，與我國的土布，是再也適合不過的了。現在所需改良的，是染色的進步；若能把土布，染得色彩調和，那麽掛在玻璃窗裏，其粗糙的布面倒反可以掩閉住了一般的棉織物所具有着的醜惡點，而十足顯示出其富貴的神態來。</p>
<p>曲綫而繁複的圖案，現在巳成過去了，這年頭兒所流行的，是簡單的直綫圖案了。在粗糙的土布上要印上繁複的圖案，自然不是便利的一回事，然而在整幅的土布上，印上粗綫條而藝術化的直綫圖案，掛在立體形屋子的玻璃窗中，配襯着屋中的立體式傢具，其諧和的成分，決小是用舶米品而與東方的一切不和諧的印花洋布，或花呢所製的窗帘所可同日而語的。</p>
<p>在暑期中，用土布窗帘，果然是嫌太厚，然而用上等的夏布，印上些簡單的直綫圖案，難道還嫌不够配製窗帘麽？提倡國貨的大企業家，爲什麽不肯着眼於此呢？</p>
<h3>四女子書畫展</h3>
<p>— 方山</p>
<p>大新書廳將舉行四家書畫展，作者爲四女士，杭縣陳小翠，鶴山馮文鳳，武進謝月眉，南匯顧飛，聞去年今日，會爲一度合展，轟動一時，比爲第二屆，作品較之上年，更見精彩。小翠作品連扇約百件，山林仕女，瀟洒工麗，一時無匹，仿新羅六如諸作，尤佳，偶爲蘭竹，亦秀逸出塵。小翠天分聰明，每學必工，書畫而外，詩詞曲賦，皆能出人頭地。會塲附售翠樓續集七卷皆其近作，女士詩，自經離亂，格調更高，悲壯處時近杜陵，詞曲，尤端莊流麗，能　乃翁衣缽，洵巾幗奇才也。文鳳聞方臥病，故作品不多，與小翠台作扇面數十，頗爲精美。顧飛爲佛影之妹，亦能詩，畫山水筆致秀潤，富　卷氣，近從名山老人學詩，故畫上多名山題詩，作品甚富，的白數十件，廬山聽泉諸作尤勝。月眉爲已故詞人謝玉岑之妹，擅花烏仿宋元，畫品高潔雅靜，作品亦較去年爲多，有三人合璧書畫屏三堂，異曲同工。會期五月廿七起共七天云，夫閨秀丹靑，世所罕　，而璧合珠聯，尤爲難得，故樂爲之記。</p>

<h3>一星期常單星家菜</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>自從新蠶豆出世以後不到一個月工夫，已經變得很老了。要是仍然炒來吃，雖然可以出殼，總覺得不大够味。所以最好的辦法，就是先出了殼，然後下鍋去炒。你要講究些的話，我來給你發明一稀十景蠶豆瓣。用雞丁，筍丁，火腿丁，蝦仁，干貝，腐衣，冬菰等，與蠶豆瓣回炒，其味之鮮美可口，眞是無可形容，不過所費也就可觀了。普通的做法，還是來一樣雪菜竹筍炒豆瓣，或葱花豆瓣沙，雪菜豆瓣沙，也很不壞，因爲是鮮蠶豆之故，覺得比陳蠶豆做的豆瓣沙可口多了。</p>

<h3>一個公衆的醫藥問題</h3>
<p>— 溪南</p>
<p>從施診給藥一方面說起</p>
<p>社會上三個大問題：一即糧食問題，一即燃料問題，一即醫藥問題。糧食與燃料，人人知注意，可是醫藥一問題，爲了疾病不是人人有的，所以注意的人尙少。其實醫藥問題之於人生，有時竟超過於糧食與燃料兩問題以上，眞司謂得之則生，小得則死，失以毫釐，謬以千里。然而現在的人，不要生病纔好，一生病，不但精神上苦痛萬分，失業費時更不必說，這一筆醫藥費尤其可觀了。</p>
<p>中藥爲了來源阻隔，漲起了七八九倍，甚至有價無貨。西藥爲了歐戰關係，外匯影響，從滬戰到目前，一漲再漲三漲四漲，不可以常理測度，不說別的，即紗布棉花較戰前漲起八倍之多。西醫出診一次二十元叫十元是常事，門診四元六元八元，不算一回事；中醫門診，二元四元亦算起碼。一貼中藥，七八元，十餘元，說是普通的；軍要些，數十元不爲奇。西藥之貴，更無論已！一針之費，十金不足異，據聞白喉血淸一針，要賣九十元；隔壁一家孩子，患白喉，從九點鐘人醫院，下午十點鐘去世，所費竟及千元。常聽說從醫院病愈川來的人說，動輒二三千元，四五千元，啊喲，儘够嚇人。試問現在的薪工階級，孜孜矻矻，一日做到夜，養家活口尙不足，千不幸，萬不幸，再加以萬惡的病魔，一日光臨，不要說破中人之產有除，簡直是一籌莫展，除了仗自身抵抗力量，與病魔惡鬥以外，沒有別法；若要延醫服藥，尙須三思而行，試問螻蟻尙惜生命，難道人豈願坐以待斃嗎？然而人到無極奈何的時候，那裏有錢去請醫生；即使請了醫生，父少了買藥的錢，這種情形，不輪到自己身上不知道，假使設身處地，非特不寒而慄，直須凄慘欲絕！</p>
<p>前天，我遇到十五年前的商報同事龔振衢兄，我就同他談　醫藥問題，我說：你是辦理施醫給藥的（龔是佛敎凈業社慈善部的幹事），據你的經騐，現在的醫藥問題是怎樣？龔先生滿口說是難！難！，我說：難在何處？他說：藥品太貴了，人太窮了。我說：藥品太貴，人人知道的；人太窮了，與醫藥問題有什麽關係。他說：爲了人窮，所以纔覺得醫藥問題特別嚴重：聯帶使我們辦理的施醫給藥亦嚴重了！我說：你說的話有些玄妙！丈二和尙，摸不着頭腦。他說：吾從覺團佛敎凈業社慈善部開辦到如今，大的有十五年功夫，只見來就診的一天多是一天；以前不必多說，去年一年，中醫二萬七千一百一百七十叫號，西醫二萬三千八百八十二號，赤貧免費（免去二角掛號費）一萬五千五百三十七號，三共六萬六千五百九十三號，發中藥四萬二千六百餘劑，西藥在外，你想這個數目已可觀。今年更不得了，每天來診的總在二百餘號，照此比例下去，不要超出七萬號嗎？我說：確然。他說：這正是人窮的緣故，早先來到施診部求診的，大多數所謂貧窮的人家？如今，在平時號稱中小資產階級，受這幾年物價在漲的壓榨，悉索以供生活還不够，遇有疾病，亦不得不拋棄虛榮心，跑到我們這裏來就診，我們的事業固然發達了！我們的經費却是發生絕大困難，藥品漲起七八倍，支川同時亦膨脹七八倍，就診的人又增加起數千號，雙方同時擴大，　經費的來源沒有增加，你想難也不難。</p>
<p>（未完）</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>「難道他不先替我安排好　隨老袁上順德去了嗎？」他禁不住這樣想。「但即使上順德去，也應該有信啊！」他眞想不出是什麽緣故了。</p>
<p>這天下午，玉崑又來了，進門便透着非常興奮的神氣。</p>
<p>「老二，果然做出來了！他把手裹捲着的一份報紙向秋海棠揚了一揚，沒頭沒腦的說：「好一個袁七爺，眞够朋友！季兆雄那個小子竟　他做掉啦！」</p>
<p>秋海棠瞪着一只右眼，一時聽不懂他說的是什麽話。</p>
<p>玉崑像風一樣的旋過身子去，輕輕地掩上了房門。實際上，那幾個看護也都知道七號的病人有些蹊蹺，紹文和玉崑的兩次要看護走出去，已使她們起了戒心，再也不願站到病房裹來妨碍別人的談話了。</p>
<p>「你看吧！報上登得很　楚。」玉崑悄悄地　在秋海棠的床前，雙手拉開了那一張報紙，距離秋海棠的臉部的摸一尺遠近，恰巧可以使他不用自己伸出手來，很淸楚的看到報上的文字。</p>
<p>秋海棠先把右眼翻往上端去一瞧，原來是一張三天前川版「北京晨報。」</p>
<p>玉崑也知道他祇剩了一個眼珠的小便，忙把雙手移下了些，正好讓他可以看到自己要他看的那一段新聞。（一一五）</p>
<h3>·此時此地·　大好訓練所</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>人變「棟樑」，首先就得博古通今，滿腹經典：做隨便什麽事如果加個「博士」「碩士」的頭銜，準保　市三倍，生意興隆！</p>
<p>想起　，逛馬路和學似乎是風學旣至上，那末立刻逛馬路去。馬牛不相關的；其實，祇要拜讀一下吿地狀者的「文章」，就可以明白了。這「文章」是包羅萬象的：要英文是英文，要法文是法文，耍國文是國文；還有駢體八股，天文地理，漫畫小調，一應俱全。其中紙有小調必須由吿地狀者親自「　授」，以免將來「學非所用」。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>其次，奮發精神也是當前急務之一，萎靡不振做不了英雄，大丈夫非有挺胸凸肚，再接再厲的精神不可！</p>
<p>那裏去學呢？電影院。</p>
<p>平時不屑「拚命」的，到買票的當兒也得勇往直前，「犧牲」一番；平時瞌睡打慣的，釗擠擠的關頭也得彈彈眼睛，搖搖身于。精神總動員也許是這裏成績最好；所以，即使是「癆病鬼」看見了也會情不自禁地引吭高歌起來，至少必怪叫</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>再下來，鍛鍊體格比吃飯都重要。</p>
<p>在曠野鍛鍊？不。在公園鍛鍊？不。諸葛亮也猜不出的：在跑狗塲，回力球塲，以及跳舞塲！</p>
<p>跑狗，人就是狗；打回力球，人就是球；跳舞，人是華爾滋，狐步。</p>
<p>而奔，骨騰，心驚，肉跳，頭頸四轉，手舞足蹈，這還不够鍛鍊嗎？</p>
<p>證明也有：常到上面三塲去的人大腹特別便便！</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>意志堅定僅次於鍛鍊體　；而且最好堅定得像鐵棺材釘人十八層地「肉」。</p>
<p>麻將紙牌，輪盤大小，老開愛死……輸剩一條褲子，當了褲子去翻本。</p>
<p>意志始終不變！</p>
<h3>「經濟新聞」</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>在學校裹讀書的時候，每天早上在家裏或者課餘走進閱報室的時候，拿起了報紙總喜歡先看些體育新聞和敎育新聞。其次便是政治新聞和社會新聞，以及經濟新聞了。</p>
<p>最近偶然和一位已有家累的朋友談起，他說近來對看報的興趣已有了改變；本來最歡喜看的體育新聞的注意力，現在却已轉移到經濟新聞上去了</p>
<p>他說：我每天起床，就立即翻開報紙，閱讀經濟新聞；看些「米價因奸商囤積　縱趨漲」，「煤球被壟斷後價格飛漲」，「油價扳守待機漲風未戢』，還有……共實這些是引不起閱讀興趣的，司是却不得不看了。</p>
<p>我聽了他到閱報注意力的轉移，心中不覺黯　。</p>

The Chinese troops advancing on the outer lines have begun to encircle the Japanese forces. At the same time, the Chinese armies in western and eastern Shanxi have also launched separate offensives, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese for days. The area north of Qinshui is particularly intense. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Japanese, with 120,000 to 130,000 troops, are exerting all their strength to launch their 14th offensive against the Chinese Zhongtiao Mountains, in an attempt to encircle the Chinese field army. The battle began on the 7th of this month and has been raging for nearly two weeks, with fierce fighting every day. During the intense battles, Japanese aircraft and artillery launched attacks with unprecedented ferocity. The Chinese fought bitterly, holding the Zhongtiao Mountains for half a month, killing nearly ten thousand Japanese and inflicting heavy losses. Currently, the Chinese have shifted to outer line operations and launched a counter-encirclement against the Japanese. At the same time, the Chinese armies in eastern and western Shanxi have also launched separate offensives against the Japanese, hoping to inflict even greater damage. (Dispatch of the 23rd) Somewhere in Eastern Zhejiang: Chinese troops pursuing north from Zhuji captured Yaogongbu on the afternoon of the 21st. The Japanese retreated towards Jianshan, and the Chinese army is still pursuing. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Xingji: After the Chinese army switched to a defensive strategy in the Zhongtiao Mountains, they became actively engaged, posing a considerable threat to the Japanese. The Japanese troops east of Tanqu, Shaoyuan, Wangwu, and Fengmenkou began to advance north on the 20th. The Chinese army is intercepting them. (Dispatch of the 23rd) Xingji: A certain Chinese unit crossed the Fen River north of Zhaocheng on the afternoon of the 20th and advanced towards the Japanese, destroying about five miles of the Tongpu Railway near Nanyizhuang. That evening, a Japanese southbound troop train arrived at that location and immediately derailed. The Chinese took the opportunity to attack, killing many Japanese. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Casualties in the Zhongtiao Mountains Reach 40,000</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to an official Central News Agency report, the Japanese army suffered more than 40,000 casualties during their 14th "mopping-up" campaign in the Zhongtiao Mountains of Shanxi Province in the past two weeks. The Japanese army used 120,000 troops in the operation, but the Chinese army switched to outer line operations and counter-encircled the Japanese forces. The official report also stated that the Chinese army had blocked the Japanese army in Guangdong Province from advancing along the East River and had recaptured Chuanluo on Sunday evening, leaving 1,500 Japanese bodies and fleeing towards Shilong. Boluo and Zidi are the only areas in Guangdong Province with a surplus of rice. This year, there is a surplus of 1.2 million dan of rice. The Japanese army's attack on these areas may be aimed at seizing food. The official report also stated that the Chinese army recaptured Linpu Town, 28 miles north of Zhuji in Zhejiang Province, last Friday and continued to sweep Xiaoshan. Another part of the Japanese army was surrounded at Jianshan, seven miles south of Linpu Town. The Chinese and Japanese armies are currently engaged in a stalemate in the Zhongtiao Mountains area of southern Shanxi. The Chinese army is also counter-attacking Japanese positions in eastern and western Shanxi and has achieved particular success in the Qinshui area. A Central News Agency dispatch from Luoyang stated that the majority of the Chinese army is maneuvering on both sides of the Japanese army in southern Shanxi, waiting for an opportunity to strike at the Japanese lines of communication during the Chinese army's general counter-offensive. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Seem to Have Abandoned Their River-Crossing Plan</h3>
<p>Luoyang: The evacuation of Luoyang has eased somewhat today because it is believed that the Japanese have abandoned their preparations to cross the river. It is reported that the Eighth Route Army has attacked the Japanese lines of communication in Shanxi and is moving south to assist the Central Army recently reinforced in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Therefore, it is believed that the Japanese have abandoned their river-crossing plan. It is said that two-thirds of the Eighth Route Army is operating against the Japanese lines of communication. It is reported that the Pinghan Railway has been cut by the Chinese army in two places, the Tongpu Railway (the north-south trunk line of Shanxi Province) has been cut in three places, and the newly built Qingbei (transliteration) Road has also been cut in two places. The evacuation of non-essential government agencies and civilians has slowed down because it is felt that the most severe period has passed. It is believed that the Japanese will not attack Luoyang at present, but most residents are still prepared to relocate immediately at any time. The reinforcement of the Central Army in Shanxi Province and the fact that the Japanese are not currently making a major attempt to cross the river have led people to believe that the Chinese army can stop any advance from the north bank of the Yellow River into Henan Province. The Chinese side is well aware that as long as the Japanese still hold the southern part of the Zhongtiao Mountains and are stationed at the mouth of the Yellow River, Luoyang will still be threatened and may become a "dead city" like Zhengzhou.

<h3>Chinese Shoot Down Three Japanese Aircraft Over Chengdu and Eastern Sichuan—Japanese Aircraft Bomb Various Locations in Shaanxi and Gansu—</h3>
<p>Chongqing: News today indicates that Chinese fighter planes shot down two Japanese aircraft during the night air raids on Chengdu and various cities and towns in eastern and northern Sichuan Province last week. According to a Japanese pilot, although many bombs were dropped during the fierce bombing of Chengdu airport, only one unimportant building suffered minor damage, and only a few craters were created in the field because most of the bombs fell in the fields. (Associated Press dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chengdu: Mr. and Mrs. White, medical missionaries at the American Church Hospital in Wuhu, arrived here on May 12. The plane they were traveling on was bombed by Japanese aircraft in Xufu on May 20. As soon as the passenger plane arrived in Xufu, Japanese aircraft appeared. The passengers hurriedly ran out and hid in nearby ditches. The bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft were small, so the passenger plane was not badly damaged. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Lanzhou: Two Japanese aircraft flew over Gansu Province on the morning of the 24th for reconnaissance. One of them intruded into the airspace over Lanzhou City and was driven away by the Chinese. The other reached a certain location in southern Longnan and then turned back. (Dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<h3>One Japanese Aircraft Shot Down Over Lanzhou</h3>
<p>Lanzhou: Twenty-five Japanese bombers and twelve fighter planes successively attacked Shaanxi and Gansu provinces on the morning of the 22nd.

A telegram was received here that evening from Jingyuan reporting that a Japanese aircraft was found crashed near Jing, with both the aircraft and crew destroyed. (Dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Gansu Provincial Government Plans to Establish a Anti-Smoking Memorial Hall</p>
<p>Ji'an: This year is the final year of the six-year anti-smoking plan. The provincial authorities have decided to establish a anti-smoking memorial hall in Ji'an to commemorate the anti-smoking policy. They are currently drawing up plans and preparing for construction. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Increase in Japanese Immigrants to Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Shaoguan: The number of Japanese people who immigrated to Hainan Island was 3,928 at the end of March, and has now increased to 5,327. This includes 2,506 from the mainland and 208 from Taiwan. In terms of activity areas, 2,429 people are in the northern part (including 1,785 people in Haikou City, the first major city on the island), and 2,898 people are in the southern part. Most of these immigrants are ruffians, mixed with so-called demobilized soldiers. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Zhang Yilin and Others Jointly Send a Telegram to Zhu De and Mao Zedong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Zhang Yilin and other councilors residing in Hong Kong believe that the large-scale Japanese offensive in the Zhongtiao Mountains is of great importance to the future of the war. They have sent a special telegram to Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and others of the Eighteenth Group Army, urging them to fight the Japanese with all their strength in the area designated by the central government. (Dispatch of the 25th) Chongqing: The gist of Zhou Enlai's letter to the Dagongbao newspaper, which was previously telegraphed, is very pertinent. He stated, in essence, "We must now call on the soldiers and civilians of the entire country to persevere in the war of independence and self-reliance, use the strength of democracy and unity to overcome the current and future major difficulties, break the enemy's blockade and division, and prepare for our counter-offensive." (Havas dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Dagongbao newspaper's editorial a few days ago, urging the Eighteenth Group Army to quickly come to the aid of the Zhongtiao Mountains battlefield, has won unanimous praise from all parties. However, the CCP representative Zhou Enlai sent a letter to the newspaper, strongly refuting the Japanese rumors as unfounded. As a result, the newspaper wrote another article, elaborating further. The wording is more profound and sincere than its first editorial. It stated, in essence, that the core of the previous morning's commentary was just one sentence: it is expected that the fact of the Eighteenth Group Army cooperating in the war will be demonstrated as soon as possible. As long as there is this fact, we will be satisfied. In addition, we do not expect that there must be great victories. The reason for expecting this fact is not only to dispel Japanese rumors, but also because after four years of war, China and Japan have both reached a serious stage. The Japanese hope that China will split and fall into chaos, so the Chinese people's need for unity and self-defense is naturally more urgent. However, the CCP organization has international characteristics, and its concept of the state is not entirely the same as that of ordinary people. The history of years of strife before the war and the discord that has emerged again recently have created a situation where the Soviet-Japanese neutrality treaty has been established. The CCP has always been most faithful to the Soviet Union, so people want to know how the CCP's future policies will be affected by the Soviet-Japanese compromise and whether the CCP will remain on the front line of national self-defense. Therefore, it is expected that there will be cooperative war-fighting facts to quickly comfort the hopes of the compatriots. It is deeply hoped that this joint operation in Shanxi will be the starting point for negotiating and resolving all the events that should be handled between the General Headquarters and the Eighteenth Group Army, and rebuilding the bulwark of unity. The newspaper most thoroughly expounds on the fundamental understanding of nation-building and the historical errors of the CCP, asking the members of the CCP to consider them.

<h3>The Sinking of the Hood and the Naval Contest Between Britain and Germany</h3>
<p>German naval raiding has been a major problem for British shipping, and the tools used have always been aircraft and submarines. German large warships sometimes venture out to sea for action, but this is considered insignificant. Especially since the sinking of the Admiral Graf Spee by a British cruiser with far weaker tonnage and armament, a general idea of ​​underestimating the German navy has been created, and it is believed that the Battle of Jutland in 1916 is unlikely to be repeated in this war. However, in the naval battle near Greenland this time, the new German battleship Bismarck showed its capabilities for the first time and sank the British battlecruiser Hood, which accounted for the world's largest tonnage, proving that the German army's tools for implementing threats in the Atlantic have expanded from aircraft and submarines to warships. Although the shock of this battle is the same as that of the Battle of the Falkland Islands, its impact will be even more significant.</p>
<p>In the current competition of the European War, the army has temporarily no use, but what both sides intend to compete for is the hegemony at sea. If Britain can maintain its naval superiority for a long time, it can passively protect Britain and its overseas transportation, and actively exert the effect of blockading Germany. If this superiority is broken, not only will the British Empire be dismembered, but even without the German army invading, Britain will be in danger of being strangled. Whether the sinking of the Hood is a sign that cracks have appeared in the British naval authority is a question that people are eager to answer. Let's first briefly review this battle itself.</p>
<p>The sinking of the Hood is a major loss for Britain, but its significance is not very serious. Although the ship has a large tonnage, it is old. Its tonnage, which is one-third larger than the Bismarck, can only provide armament and speed that are comparable to it. Moreover, the 20-year difference in age has already determined the superiority or inferiority of the two ships' performance. Looking at the process of the sinking of the Hood, the speed of its sinking and the number of crew members who died are enough to prove that the report published by the British side that the ammunition depot was hit and exploded is indeed the truth. Rather than attributing it to the excellent German warship, it must be said that it was to some extent accidental, because until after the German warship won, the German side could not accurately say that what it sank was the Hood. This large and useless warship belongs to the battlecruiser class, and as usual, it has to sacrifice armor to enhance its armament and speed. Compared with the 31,000-ton Queen Elizabeth class or the 33,500-ton Nelson class battleships, its armor is as thin as one or two inches. This is probably the main weakness of the Hood, which is the same as the sinking situation of the Admiral Graf Spee. In terms of armament, the eight 15-inch guns installed on the Hood are not the most ideal weapons for battleships. The recently launched British King George V class, equipped with ten 14-inch guns, has much better projectile launching force and penetrating force than the eight 15-inch guns. If what the German warship encountered was not the old Hood but this type of new battleship, the result would be very different. The unparalleled authority of the British Navy has always been built on the superior power and multi-faceted performance of its ships and its excellent traditions. This has not changed to any extent until now.</p>
<p>In terms of nature, this naval battle off Greenland can be determined to be an encounter battle, because the main battle was obviously what the German warship tried to avoid. Its main task was not to confront but to raid. It is undoubtedly brave to lightly engage in the ocean with only a few main battleships, but the risk is also extremely high. It is possible to be ambushed by the British Navy at any time in the vast ocean. Moreover, once it is damaged, it is absolutely impossible to safely return to its home naval base. Compared with the British, who have convenient repair facilities on both the east and west coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, the two cannot be compared. At present, in addition to the Bismarck and its sister ship Tirpitz, the German main battleships also include two 26,000-ton Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. After repeated bombings by the British Air Force, the extent of the damage is still a mystery. According to general speculation, the two 40,000-ton main battleships that began to be built in 1937 are believed to have been launched. In fact, its strength is not far from the level of the undamaged French navy. It should not be underestimated. However, with the strength of the British side, it is still more than capable of dealing with it.</p>
<p>At present, the British side's concern at sea is not the strength or weakness of its strength and the sinking of a few ships, but the dispersion of the battle lines. The British Navy is currently undertaking a task that is more arduous than at any other time. Protecting overseas routes and various territories is already extremely difficult. The current bloody battle in the Mediterranean and Crete is attracting the largest part of the British Navy's strength. It is only natural that the German side is taking this opportunity to develop the Atlantic offensive, because Nazi ships have no other tasks to bear. If the Battle of the Mediterranean continues to be deadlocked or unfortunately deteriorates, the threat to the Atlantic will also increase. The significance of the Battle of Greenland to Britain is not only the sinking of a giant ship, but also that this multi-faceted offensive will make Britain feel tricky. However, if the situation in Crete and Iraq can improve rapidly, the naval strength in the Mediterranean can be withdrawn and strengthened to defend the Atlantic, and everything will naturally change greatly.</p>
<p>The United States is now on the eve of a major decision. This naval battle took place in the waters near Greenland under the protection of the United States. This is undoubtedly a major stimulus for the American officials and people, and it will further strengthen the active factors in Roosevelt's speech tomorrow. The more serious the situation in the Atlantic, the more quickly the United States will share Britain's war responsibilities. The sinking of the Hood is a major victory for the German Navy, but its impact will make Germany's prospects for success even more slim.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Naval Battle in the North Atlantic</p>
<h3>42,000-Ton British Battleship "Hood" Sunk. Ammunition Depot Hit, More Than a Thousand Soldiers Killed. German Battleship "Bismarck" Also Heavily Damaged.</h3>
<p>London: Last night, the British Navy Department announced that the British battlecruiser "Hood" (42,000 tons, the world's largest battleship) was intercepting the German fleet off Greenland on Saturday morning when it was unfortunately hit in the main ammunition depot, causing the ship to explode and sink. It is feared that few crew members survived. The German fleet included the battleship "Bismarck," which was damaged. The British fleet is still pursuing it. The "Hood" was built in 1920 and carried eight 15-inch guns, twelve 5.5-inch guns, and four 4-inch anti-aircraft guns. Its speed was 30 nautical miles. The captain was Cole Oberon. It usually had 2,341 officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>The German battleship "Bismarck" had a displacement of 30,000 tons and a speed of 30 nautical miles. It was launched in early February 1939 and carried eight 15-inch guns and twelve 5-inch guns. It was 79 feet long and 116 feet wide. It was a sister ship of the "Tirpitz." (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that the fleet commanded by German Fleet Commander General Lütjens encountered a British cruising fleet in the Icelandic area and a battle occurred. The German battleship "Bismarck" sank the battleship "Hood," which is known as the largest warship in the world. The newly built British warship "King George" was also injured and retreated. The entire German fleet triumphed without any losses. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>London: Outside the coast of Greenland, which is under the protection of the United States, a major battle occurred between the British and German navies yesterday. The German new-style battleship "Bismarck" hit the ammunition depot of the British battlecruiser "Hood," and the British ship exploded and sank, killing more than a thousand people. The 39,000-ton "Bismarck" was also damaged. The British fleet is now chasing the German fleet to the east. The "Hood" had a displacement of 41,000 tons and was the world's largest battlecruiser. When it sank, following the true traditional precepts of the British Navy, its eight 15-inch guns and countless small guns roared together, and the flags still flew. Commander Vice Admiral Holland is believed to have been killed in action. The "Hood" usually had 1,341 combat officers, soldiers, and crew. The "Bismarck" had eight 15-inch guns. This was said to be the first time it had joined the battle, and it was also the first time that the Atlantic lifeline had been threatened by a formidable German fleet. The "Hood" had several tons of steel armor to protect its hull, so it was always regarded as invincible and unsinkable. Since the Battle of Jutland, this has been the most severe loss for the British Navy. The British Navy Department did not mention the injuries of other British and German ships. The British naval circles admitted that the British fleet is scattered around the world and its strength is weak. Therefore, this loss is a serious blow to the British Navy, but they also pointed out that the King George V class battleships are now intact. (International dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<h3>Details of the Naval Battle</h3>
<p>London: The world's largest battleship, "Hood," was sunk by a German battleship yesterday. Just as thousands of relatives of the ship's personnel are mourning their casualties, millions of Britons are eagerly awaiting the latest news of the first encounter between the British and German navies. Authoritative sources have supplemented the Central Navy Department's bulletin, stating that the "Hood" was apparently fatally struck by a 15-inch giant shell fired by the German battleship "Bismarck." The iron armor protecting the side of the ship's turret, which was one foot thick, was penetrated by the shell. The shell also used the power of the cyclone to penetrate directly into the ship's main ammunition depot. The ship shook and staggered violently, and due to the howling cold wind, the waves around the ship were constantly impacting it. Thus, after a few minutes of swaying, the glorious history of this disabled "Hood" for twenty years came to an end. The "Bismarck," which was protected by Nazi destroyers, cruisers, and some light warships, wanted to end the battle after being injured, but the British battleships kept firing on it and intercepted the German flagship and its fleet to prevent them from escaping. (International dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<h3>The United States is Shocked</h3>
<p>Washington: The loss of the "Hood" shocked American diplomatic and naval officials. Privately, it is predicted that the demand for the complete use of the US Navy to ensure the safe arrival of military supplies in Britain will increase in the future. The fact that the naval battle in which the "Hood" was sunk occurred near Greenland raises the question of whether the area has been incorporated into the US Navy's patrol area. However, the US government has not given any indication of what action it will take. Some speculate that this may cause President Roosevelt to slightly modify his fireside chat scheduled for the second day. (International dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>New York: US General Stirling recently wrote an article on the sinking of the "Hood." His article stated, in essence, that the British-German naval battle on Saturday, in which Britain lost the world's largest battleship, "Hood," is enough to prove the weakness of battlecruisers. The armor of the "Hood" was far less than that of the Nelson and Rodney class ships. The "Hood" only had 12 inches of armor, while the "Nelson" had 14 inches of armor protection. The "Hood" only had 12 inches of bulletproof equipment, while the "Nelson" had 16 inches. In the Battle of Jutland in the last war, the British ship "Mary" was also a battlecruiser and was destroyed by a shell. The destruction of the "Hood" today may be due to the same reason. This naval battle may be the largest direct naval battle between Britain and Germany since the Battle of Jutland. Naval personnel are quite skeptical about whether the fully armored King George V class ships participated in the war. As for the participants in the German fleet, it is feared that it includes not only the "Bismarck," but also several German pocket battleships, destroyers, submarines, or even the "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau," if they were not damaged in the British Air Force's bombing of Brest, they may also participate. (Associated Press dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<h3>Berlin's Jubilation</h3>
<p>Berlin, Germany - The sinking of the German ship "Holt" and the crippling of another British battleship have caused great jubilation. The German High Command admitted that the German fleet had suffered some minor losses, but stated that the revitalized German navy would strike with "full force" to destroy America's "full force" support for Britain. Britain's inland fleet #is Britain's primary defense against German ships#. However, the German fleet will soon take the lead in a full-scale attack on the British inland fleet. This victory is a clear victory in the first test of the German main fleet. Germany issued an announcement regarding the engagement between Iceland and the "Holt," stating that the ship "exploded from the surface of the water," and few of its crew survived. The announcement did not specify whether the naval battle was still continuing. The German High Command declared that the direct confrontation of giant battleships was the first in history. The result of this war can be said that the German navy, possessing new-style dreadnoughts, has been able to break Britain's naval control, as the German dreadnoughts can destroy Britain's giant ships. (May 25th, International Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin - The sinking of the British ship "Holt" was unanimously praised by the German national newspapers as "one of the most glorious pages in German naval history." Air Force General Goering's mouthpiece stated that "Bismarck" had eliminated the greatest power of the British Navy, and the last pillar of Britain's fantasy of victory had also fallen. Germany's victory in the North Atlantic naval battle has significant political implications. (May 25th, International Telegram)</p>

<p>German Newspaper Warns America - American Ships Should Not Sail in the Red Sea</p>
<p>Berlin - An editorial in the Army Weekly yesterday warned the United States that American ships must not sail into the Red Sea, because Roosevelt had declared the Red Sea a non-war zone. The article stated, "This warning is not without reason, as recently, the war in the Near East and around Egypt has expanded, and the Red Sea has been designated as a war zone by Germany. Therefore, every ship sailing into the Red Sea has the potential to be destroyed. This is a special warning to the United States." (May 25th, United Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>British Far East Air Force Deputy Commander Delivers Broadcast Speech - Says British Air Force in Singapore Has Immense Offensive and Defensive Power</h3>
<p>Singapore - Air Vice-Marshal Pulford, who took office as Commander of the British Far East Air Force five weeks ago, delivered his first broadcast tonight, stating that the British Air Force in this region has immense power, both offensively and defensively. However, he repeatedly stated that Britain has no intention of invading other countries in the Pacific. Pulford declared that the offensive power of the British forces in the Far East has reached a very high level, and behind them, there is an unlimited amount of American supply, and this supply has never been interrupted, because the United States is our true and loyal friend. Pulford also stated that although there are currently raiding ships attacking merchant ships, American military supplies are still arriving safely in Singapore as usual. Pulford also stated that we should not think that the purpose of the Air Force is still to defend Singapore. It should be known that last year, we completed a connection of military airfields everywhere, from the northern border to Singapore and Borneo, and there are also facilities in Burma, and far from the border with China. If the war spreads to the Far East, these airfields can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes. (May 25th, United Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Unfold Around Maleme Airfield - British Planes Reappear Over Crete - The Roar of Artillery Prevents German Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Cairo - According to the latest information received here, the reappearance of British fighter planes over Crete has greatly excited the Allied forces. The key point on the island, still occupied by the Germans, is Maleme. The Allied forces have stepped up their attack on this point. Since Heraklion and Rethymno have been recaptured by the Allied forces, the Allied forces can assist in attacking the Maleme airfield. British artillery shells and bombs are falling like rain day and night on the airfield. Although the Germans have lost many soldiers and aircraft, they are still holding on, waiting for the arrival of aircraft carrying soldiers and equipment. It is reported that British long-range artillery is damaging German troop transport planes. It is reported that troop transport planes are unloading soldiers on the beach, but each time they are swept clean by British fighter planes. Recent Middle East communiqués state that on Friday, the German attempt to reinforce Crete, and the troops parachuted into the white sky in Heraklion and Rethymno have been effectively resolved. Those who landed elsewhere are also being cleared by the Allied forces. (May 25th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Cairo - A military spokesman here announced last night that there is still very fierce fighting on Crete, but the situation in Heraklion and Rethymno is, on the whole, satisfactory. The situation in Maleme is still tense. British morale is very good, and they are fighting bravely all day long, regardless of dive bombing, and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Many enemy troop transport planes have been lost. In addition, an air force communiqué stated that British bombers attacked a large number of Junkers Ju 52 enemy aircraft in Maleme airfield and on the beach, destroying at least ten of them and damaging many others. Enemy soldiers were also bombed. According to post-war reconnaissance reports, many enemy aircraft in Junkers were indeed burned and completely unusable. British long-range fighters also attacked the enemy in Maleme, destroying at least four troop transport planes. (Misdated May 2, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Cairo - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser told a Reuters interviewer yesterday that the outcome of the Battle of Crete could be determined in the next few hours. He is confident that the brave New Zealand soldiers, Australian, British, and Greek warriors on the island will be able to hold the island in an unprecedented environment, resisting an unprecedented aerial attack. Although the situation on the island is very favorable for aerial attacks, the German air force bases are very close, and the Allied forces have reported a lack of aerial support, but he firmly believes that the Allied forces will eventually win, and the New Zealand soldiers will be able to perform on Crete.

<h3>Berlin Issues Special Communiqué - Boasts Success of New Tactics</h3>
<p>Berlin - German radio stations broadcast a special communiqué from the German High Command at 4:30 PM yesterday. First, they announced the landing of German troops on Crete, stating briefly that on the fifth day of the operation, Germany had occupied the western half of Crete. The British fleet north of Crete had been repulsed. It was stated that Crete is at least one hundred kilometers from mainland Greece, and that the landing of troops from the sky is unprecedented in military history, and that the battle of Crete is clearly different from the battles of the small Aegean islands. The battle of Crete has proven that air power is more important than naval power in modern warfare. It is believed that the battle of Crete is a precursor to even more important battles of the same kind. (May 25th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin - The fierce naval and air battle between Britain and Germany in the waters off Crete from the 21st to the 23rd of this month is clear evidence that the Air Force can control the Navy. Each British battleship has more than 40 anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, and light cruisers have 12. The intensity of the anti-aircraft fire at that time can be imagined, but the German planes were eventually able to sink many British ships, which shows the power of the Air Force. (May 25th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>London - The German High Command has issued a special communiqué, for the first time mentioning the Battle of Crete, stating that since the morning of May 20th, German paratroopers and troops transported by aircraft have successively landed on Crete to fight against the British army, aided by fighter squadrons and bomber squadrons, seizing important strongholds. After the German army continues to receive reinforcements, it will take the offensive, and the western part of the island will be in the hands of the German army. The German Air Force has sunk and destroyed many enemy ships, and has established air superiority in the entire theater of war. The entire war is now continuing to develop according to the planned plan. The German High Command will order the adoption of appropriate retaliatory measures against English prisoners numbering ten times as many, Prime Minister Churchill's statement that German paratroopers are wearing nylon army uniforms is incorrect, this is a pretext for the British to treat German paratroopers in violation of international law.

<h3>Soviet Pravda Publishes Article Commenting on the Importance of the Cretan War</h3>
<p>Moscow - Pravda recently published an article entitled "The Battle for Crete," stating, "The battle of Crete is extremely noteworthy, because this is the first decisive test of a large number of troops landing from the air under the supervision of the British Navy. The battle of Crete is extremely important for the future development of the eastern Mediterranean. As far as Britain is concerned, after Crete is lost, it will not only lose its base for defending Egypt, but its position in the Near East will also be greatly threatened. At the same time, the crisis of the Suez Canal will also increase. On the other hand, after Germany takes Crete, it can freely use its superior air force base to bomb Alexandria and other British bases. Undoubtedly, the German offensive in Crete is a new stage in the battle for maritime communications. Washington is paying close attention to the development of the Mediterranean. The publication of Stimson's and the US Secretary of the Navy's speeches calling for the repeal of the Neutrality Act coincides with the intense fighting in the eastern Mediterranean, which is particularly noteworthy.

<h3>German Forces Advance in Two Routes - Ambush at Hellfire Pass - Eleven Tanks Destroyed - Remnants of Italian Army in Albania Being Eliminated</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent with the vanguard of the British Army in the Western Desert reports that the most serious loss of tanks since the army appeared in Libya was on Friday. On that day, German forces advanced in two routes, seeking to enter the key points within the Egyptian border. "Hellfire Pass" The first route advanced along the edge of the slope and was ambushed by the British army near Cholun at 10:00 AM, and retreated. Two German tanks were destroyed and several were damaged. At noon, another German force was found trying to attack the British left flank, and was also attacked violently. Six enemy tanks were destroyed, and the rest were forced to retreat across the border. There were no losses to British tanks. On Wednesday, three German tanks were also destroyed near the border. Therefore, the German army lost a total of eleven tanks in forty minutes. Although this setback does not have a major impact on the total number of tanks that the German army can use in North Africa, it has proven that the German army's policy of attacking weak points and the strength of the British army's tanks has failed. In addition to tank activity, the German army has not shown any intention of regaining the land lost last week. Currently, the German army seems to be more focused on building defenses around the Gabes border area and Tobruk. (May 25th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Cairo - A communiqué here last night stated that a large sandstorm rose in the Tobruk area yesterday, obstructing the view and preventing combat operations. British patrols and artillery units in the Solun area are still continuing their offensive strategy. On Thursday night, a British bomber squadron attacked Benghazi, causing damage to the enemy. The South African Air Force is still bombing enemy transport teams and troop concentration points in Abyssinia to coordinate with the British forces in central Africa. The Mosul airfield in Iraq was also strafed by British planes. (May 25th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>US Army and Navy in Hawaii Conduct Large-Scale Exercises - Flying Fortresses Also Participate in the Battle - The Exercise Lasts Twelve Days</h3>
<p>Honolulu - News yesterday stated that the US Army's Hawaiian fleet and officers are closely watching the German attempt to invade Crete, because they feel that Crete and Hawaii have several similarities in defense plans. The US Army's Hawaiian forces have just completed their largest exercise in history. This exercise demonstrated a program in which a vast mechanized force annihilated the "invaders." In addition to ground forces, this mechanized force also had "Flying Fortresses" recently flown here to help in the battle. Well-informed sources pointed out that the position of the US defense forces in Hawaii is somewhat similar to the position of the British and Greek defenders in Crete, but Hawaii may not have to deal with a large number of airborne soldiers like Crete. In the exercise, Hawaii's defense forces will fight against a fleet that occupies all the islands outside Oahu and attempts to land at the Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Honolulu, Oahu and the main defense fortresses of the army via the sea. According to unofficial sources, the distance between Hawaii and its closest "enemy" military base makes it very difficult for the enemy to supply the invading forces landed by aircraft on Oahu with the necessary military supplies, even after occupying the outer islands. This is the main difference between Hawaii and Crete, because when the German army attacked Crete, it could concentrate troops, equipment, and supplies on the nearby Greek mainland. After the outer islands were occupied by the enemy and enemy forces landed on Oahu, it was followed by the withdrawal of a portion of the US Navy in this area, so the decision was made for the enemy to simultaneously attack the US Pacific and Atlantic defenses. Part of the US Navy was forced to withdraw, and the remaining part of the US Navy was annihilated. Enemy forces landed, followed by naval bombardment and violent air attacks. In this battle, the enemy established a base in Oahu to threaten Honolulu and Pearl Harbor. The US Army stated that the final battle was taking place before dawn, when infantry, artillery, tanks, and engineering teams launched a fierce attack on the enemy's stronghold. A total of 1,000 soldiers participated in this final war, and the enemy was wiped out in the area between the mountains and the sea. Army officials stated that the most important tool for the defending soldiers, the Flying Fortress, cooperated with the ground troops attacking the enemy and dropped heavy bombs on the enemy forces. This exercise lasted for twelve days and was completed only yesterday, and each returned to its garrison. (May 25th, United Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Endorses Amendment to Neutrality Act, Roosevelt Prepared to Speak on Tuesday, Will Express Something Regarding Maritime Freedom</h3>
<p>Washington – According to yesterday’s investigation by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of the thirteen members on the committee, it is likely that if the administration proposes to abolish the Neutrality Act, they will endorse it. The other ten members will oppose it. However, in fact, the members of the committee have not yet officially decided what position they will take. However, privately, it is said that the voting ratio of the April 30th rejection of the ban on escorting ships will be the same for the vote on abolishing the Neutrality Act. The twenty-odd members of the Foreign Relations Committee have the advantage. Three members said that they have not received official news regarding President Roosevelt’s plan to propose the abolition of the Neutrality Act. However, they believe that Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox will not propose the abolition of the Neutrality Act in their recent speeches without the formal approval of the White House. (United Press dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt is spending his weekend preparing for the speech he will deliver on Tuesday. At this time, calls from Congress and newspapers for amending the Neutrality Act have spread far and wide, indicating what the public hopes to hear from the President on Tuesday. According to many well-informed sources, what the President will say will mainly focus on (1) extending the Monroe Doctrine to the entire Atlantic Ocean, and (2) the need to restore the policy of maritime freedom. The restoration of the policy of maritime freedom will naturally involve the amendment of the Neutrality Act, as this Act prohibits American ships from entering war zones and contradicts the policy of freedom. The New York Times's commentary on the call for amending the Neutrality Act is quite incisive, stating that those who drafted this Act at the time believed that the United States only needed to issue an advance notice that in the event of war, the United States could automatically abandon its long-enjoyed maritime rights to protect the New World from war. It must be known that this kind of experiment has already failed. If this Act is intended to prevent the United States from joining the war, then why is the United States so eager to implement conscription, build a two-ocean navy, and make its own country a military factory producing airplanes and war materials? With this Neutrality Act, we are in great danger. The criticisms of this Act by Secretary of the Navy Knox and Secretary of War Stimson show that the President is now considering the restoration of the principle of maritime freedom to help Britain win the Atlantic victory. If the President makes this announcement on Tuesday, it will definitely receive the rapid support of the people and Congress. What is also noteworthy here is that the isolationists, who have always strongly opposed participating in the war, are now openly declaring that if the United States does participate in the war, they will faithfully rally behind the President. They certainly want the United States to participate in the war to a small extent, but once it is necessary to participate in the war, they will do their best to increase their combat power.

<h3>French Officials Will Go to Paris to Continue Talks, Exchange Views on Some Practical Issues</h3>
<p>Vichy – Political figures here recently stated that the Franco-German negotiations are now being carried out in accordance with the principles revealed in Associate Darlan's speech. A general outline has already been agreed upon, with only some practical issues remaining to be discussed by both sides, such as production prices and currency issues. Because French industry has suffered since the blockade, fuel and necessities are in short supply. Only cooperation with Germany can remedy this. Therefore, the free flow of raw materials and industrial products between the free and occupied zones of France is a matter of urgency. In addition, both sides have previously signed an agreement on Franco-German industrial cooperation, and this should continue to be promoted in the future. In addition, Agriculture Minister Caziot and Army Minister General Huntziger are scheduled to travel to Paris together tomorrow, and this is also related to the ongoing Franco-German negotiations.

In the by-election held in the Busselton area, the government's candidate, Mr. Pulleine, won with a majority of votes. This is a harbinger of Prime Minister Menzies continuing to hold office, as this result can be regarded as the public's approval of the Australian government's war efforts and support for a government of national unity. Acting Australian Prime Minister Fadden said that this result is clear evidence that the Australian government's war policy is supported by the public. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>

<h3>German Newspaper Slanders Roosevelt, Claims Jewish Ancestry</h3>
<p>London – German newspapers yesterday published news attempting to prove that President Roosevelt is of Jewish descent, pointing out that President Roosevelt's advisors, such as Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, Harvard University Professor Frankfurter, currency expert Baruch, New York Governor Lehman, etc., are almost all Jews. German radio broadcasts this news, saying that President Roosevelt once said that his ancestors arrived in America from the Netherlands about 300 years ago, and that he did not care whether they were Jews, Catholics, or Christians. According to investigations, in 1720, there were several people with the surname Roosevelt in New Amsterdam, and they were Jews, and their ancestors were certainly also Jews. The earliest traceable ancestor of the Roosevelt family was a Jewish woman. This is a fact, and her descendants often intermarried with Jews. Even President Roosevelt's mother came from a Jewish family, and the President's wife is also of Jewish blood. The President's mother-in-law's name is Hall, and she is indeed a Jew.

<h3>Shigemitsu Probes US on Mediation of War</h3>
<p>Chongqing – China is paying close attention to Japan's recall of its ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, and speculates that Shigemitsu may probe Washington's response to US mediation of the Sino-Japanese war when he passes through the United States on his way back to Japan. It is understood that Shigemitsu is one of the few diplomats not replaced by Foreign Minister Matsuoka, so some believe that the decision to recall him may be due to this. (United Press dispatch of the 25th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Daily News commented on the impending return of Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, saying that this shows that Anglo-Japanese relations are deteriorating daily. Although Shigemitsu claims that there is no sign of deterioration in Anglo-Japanese relations, we do not agree. Recently, when the British House of Commons met, Foreign Secretary Eden's statement of Britain's determination to help China in the war and oppose Japan's discrimination against British interests in China, and the remarks made by British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr regarding the Burma Road, were a major blow to the Japanese army. The fundamental reason for the deterioration of Anglo-Japanese relations is Japan's aggression in China and the destruction of British interests in China, which has created the current situation. The key to the problem today is whether Japan will realize its mistakes. I wonder if Shigemitsu will seriously consider this issue when he returns to Tokyo. (Reuters dispatch of the 25th)</p>

<h3>Steady Supply from Hong Kong and Saigon Keeps Rice Prices from Rising, Rice Market Manipulations Unreliable, Actual Price of Saigon Rice Still Undisclosed</h3>
<p>According to rice industry sources, Chu Qiaqing, while in Shanghai, ordered 8,000 tons (or 80,000 bags) of small-grain rice for May delivery directly from Rangoon on behalf of certain sundry grain stores. They are now en route to Shanghai and should arrive by the end of this month or the beginning of next month. However, the shipping lines used for the cargo are still unknown. Shanghai's food reserves are more than sufficient compared to any past period, and the Public Concession’s subsidized Hong Kong rice is also being shipped to Shanghai steadily. Furthermore, the French Municipal Council’s Saigon rice will also arrive soon. Not only is the food supply of the city guaranteed, but a continued drop in prices is also expected.</p>
<p>Saigon Rice Prices: No Firm News Yet</p>
<p>The Saigon rice directly ordered from the Vietnamese government by the French Municipal Council, in its first batch will arrive in Shanghai this month. Rumors say that there are as many as 200,000 bags, but according to reporters at the Pingming News Agency, there are in fact only about 100,000 bags, and only 50,000 bags have been shipped to Shanghai. As for the selling price of Saigon rice, Sarly did not clearly indicate it when he convened a meeting of sundry grain merchants last week to discuss sales. He only agreed to give a handling fee of 8%. However, according to general speculation, the selling price of Saigon rice in the future will probably be similar to the selling price of the Public Concession’s subsidized Hong Kong rice. In addition, the French shipping company’s General Joffre, arrived at the port of Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:30 pm, carrying 30,000 bags of Saigon rice. The reporter learned from other sources that some rice shops have obtained cheaper foreign rice from the authorities, so some are offering to sell it for 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Needs: Steadily Supplied</p>
<p>Although the French Municipal Council has only ordered 100,000 bags of Saigon rice from Vietnam for the time being, the import of this Saigon rice is entirely handled by the import committee organized by the three foreign firms, Dufour, etc. The French Municipal Council is in a supervisory position, while the Vietnamese side is also handled by the export committee, which is supervised by the Vietnamese government. From now on, Shanghai’s needs can be met and the rice will definitely be shipped on schedule without interruption.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 10,000 Bags Shipped from Nanning Arrived</p>
<p>At the same time, the subsidized Hong Kong rice ordered from the Hong Kong government by the Public Concession will also be supplied on schedule. The Taikoo Company's Nanning, carrying 10,000 bags of Hong Kong rice, arrived at the port at 10:00 AM yesterday and was docked at buoys 33 and 34 on the Huangpu River. Unloading began at 1:00 PM. The Suzhou, which was also carrying a nest of rice bags, did not arrive yesterday and will probably be delayed until today. It was rumored that the Hanyang, which arrived yesterday, was carrying 10,000 bags of Hong Kong rice, but according to an employee of Jardine Matheson, this was not the case. The ship did not carry rice this time.</p>
<p>Weighting and Refunds Begin Today</p>
<p>Currently, there are a total of 743 firms that have ordered subsidized Hong Kong rice from Jardine Matheson. According to Xiangmao Yanghang's statistics, as of last Saturday, payments have generally been completed. As for rice shops that picked up goods from the warehouses last week and found that the weight of each bag was less than 224 pounds, they can go to Xiangmao Yanghang to get a refund from today onwards with the weight slips from the three warehouses, San Yi, Paulsen, and David. The deadline is three days, until the 28th of this month.</p>

(1) The United States is represented by economic commissioner Fox, (2) Britain is represented by economic expert Rogers, and (3) China is represented by Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Trade Commission, Xi Demao, director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Bei Songsun, manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China. The reporter from the New Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles that Rogers and Fox will come to China. As soon as they arrive in Hong Kong, the first committee meeting will be held to announce the establishment of the committee. The committee will be based in Hong Kong, stabilize the statutory foreign exchange, authorize the Central Bank to handle it, maintain the Shanghai black market exchange rate, and authorize foreign banks such as HSBC to handle it. Matters concerning the application for statutory foreign exchange for the import of essential goods to China will still be handled by the original review agencies. Therefore, the statutory foreign exchange will be permanently stable, that is, the US exchange rate will be 30 yuan and the British exchange rate will be one shilling and two and a half pence, and the black market foreign exchange will be stable for a long time. It will also prevent manipulation and speculation in the foreign exchange market, as well as the grabbing of foreign exchange by conspirators.</p>
<p>Wang Jun donated 2,000 yuan to the New Puyutang Donation</p>
<p>Since the New Puyutang published a report on donations before the end of April and opened up various channels for assistance, it has received a warm response from society and received many donations of money and goods.

It is hoped that all sectors of society will follow in Mr. Wang's footsteps, donate generously, and support the continuation of the New Puyutang, so as to prevent the more than 1,000 orphans adopted by the hall from being hungry and cold.</p>
<h3>The Spring Flower Show by Ainong</h3>
<p>The 65th Spring Flower Show, organized by the Shanghai Flower Show, was held yesterday in the Grandstand Building. A flower-lined path happily led the author into the venue. The two large halls were arranged on the left and right. From the instructions on the wooden signs, I knew that the right hall was displaying table flower arrangements, etc., and the left hall was displaying flower piles, vegetables, etc. I stepped into the one on the right, because this one is the essence of the Flower Show.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered this hall, the first thing that caught my eye were two large flower mountains, standing against the wall, seemingly as imposing as the Four Heavenly Kings in a temple, attracting attention. The flowers on these two flower mountains were collected from the major parks of the Public Concession and arranged by Cao Desheng of Jiaozhou Park. The background was a blue cloth curtain, and the flowers of various colors were piled up in flower pots, colorful and dazzling. Yellow and red, white and green, purple and green reflected each other, setting each other off. The color arrangements were exceptionally bright, and the layers were arranged in an orderly manner, seeming to fill the eyes with an unspeakable pleasure.</p>
<p>The table settings occupied a large part of this hall, and this time there were many more, which can be divided into banquet style, home style, and tea style. Among them, the first prize for the banquet style was won by a table called "Fishing and Returning Home for a Big Feast." The tablecloth was made of fishnet, and a pot of water lilies and reeds was placed in the center, forming a waterscape. The table was completely filled with aquatic products, with a Western color, light, and ingenious, which was the characteristic of this table.</p>
<p>This time, Chinese member Zhou Shoujuan still participated with bonsai with Eastern sentiments and won the Cadu and Special Grand Prize trophies. According to the organizers, because the Peter Grand Silver Plaque had already been awarded to the Sichuanese exhibitor who stacked the flower mountains, and Mr. Zhou's products were really worthy of this trophy, he had no choice but to have the chairman and judge Mr. Cadu temporarily make a large silver cup to award to Mr. Zhou as a special award. Such special treatment was indeed a great honor. This time, the exhibits were still arranged on three tables, and still in their original positions. The table in the center was covered with a soft green and goose-yellow patterned brocade carpet, which was exceptionally eye-catching. In the center of the table was an old pot from the Ming Dynasty, planted with an old and rugged Gardenia, and an ancient Dharma statue sat next to the dragon-claw-like root nest, instantly feeling ancient. Next to it was a pot of agate pomegranates on a cliff, the bark was very old, but it was full of flowers, the flowers were large and the leaves were lush, which was especially rare. On the left was also a pot of Golden Jasmine on a cliff, with a fragrant fragrance. In front of it was a shallow ancient porcelain pot with wild bamboo, the leaves were green and lush, and the branches were straight and beautiful, which was especially energetic. There were also two pieces of Ling stone covered with green moss in a dry white water basin, and a boat was crossing between the stone walls, titled "Boating on the Spring Water is Like Sitting in the Sky," which was truly a masterpiece full of poetic and artistic charm. The table on the right was a small product, with various exquisite small ancient pots placed in the frame, planted with small holly, small elm trees, small gardenia, small roses, small crabapples, and small ivy, all of which were small but excellent, and could be played with in the palm of the hand. Among them, a two-and-a-half-inch oval pot was arranged into a bamboo forest thatched cottage, which was elegant and lovely. In this display cabinet, the colors were distinct and the arrangement was exquisite, creating a unique style in the show. Next to the frame was a Qinghua porcelain deep square pot, matched with a large Forsythia in the shape of a cliff, the posture was beautiful, which was rarely seen. An old Western gentleman saw it and humorously said to his friend, "I would like to make a will and be buried here after death." It can also be seen his old man's emotions of loving it as if it were alive.</p>
<p>After turning a corner, in the Western colors, the bonsai with Eastern sentiments appeared, which turned out to be Mr. Kong Zhiqing's product. Mr. Kong is a water and stone expert, so in his products, water and stone each accounted for half of the pot, and the arrangement was high and low. Among them, the one labeled "Purple Bamboo Forest" was the most simple and elegant. In a deep stone cave, there was a white stone statue of Guanyin, and a dragon-like ancient cypress was planted on the stone cave. The cave was full of purple bamboo. The pot was also pasted with ant-like labels, which turned out to be the "Heart Sutra" written by Wu Sheng Jushi, which made people feel the majesty of Buddhism. There was also a "Fishing Pleasure Picture," which was also eye-catching. In a shallow water basin, the stream was winding, and three boats were parked on the shore, like an ancient painting of a fisherman's paradise. There was also a "Fragrant Snow Sea," which was planted with more than ten Gardenias, which was many but not chaotic, and it was indeed rare. Moreover, the trees were full of white flowers, and a small stream ran across the trees, and a wooden bridge was built across the two banks, with thatched cottages lined up on both sides, full of rural flavor. There were about forty other small potted plants and water stones.</p>
<p>Turning to the large hall on the left again, there were three large piles of flowers, and large pots of regular grass flowers and other strange flowers and plants. Although they were very beautiful, they really didn't suit our taste, but they could attract the attention of Western ladies and gentlemen. As usual, there was a vegetable exhibition this year, but these fruits and vegetables that foreigners eat are naturally a mystery to me.</p>
<p>Walking out of the venue in this way, it had been a full three hours, but it seemed that there was still some residual fragrance on the nose, and a deep impression remained in the brain—the beauty of the East and the beauty of the West are, after all, different!</p>
<h3>French Concession Iron Gates Remain Closed, Nanshi Enters Lockdown, Those Unable to Return Home Bivouac in the Streets, Republic Road and Other Places Under Strict Search</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the iron gates between the French Concession and Nanshi, the Japanese have intermittently closed them. Therefore, incidents of residents being blocked from entering or exiting have occurred from time to time. Recently, because a Japanese person was shot and killed, the Japanese side demanded that the authorities completely close all the iron gates and implement an emergency search. Although the Xinwen River iron gate was once opened to allow Nanshi residents working in the concession to return to Nanshi, from dawn yesterday, all the iron gates were again closed as before and remained closed all day. Thousands of residents were blocked inside and outside the iron gates. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Searching for the Murderer Yields No Results</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language "Mainichi Shimbun," at 10:00 a.m. on the 24th, Kabashima Kikuji, the captain of the Nanshi Japanese Military Police, wearing plain clothes, was inspecting various locations in Nanshi. When he reached near the Daji Inn at No. 60 Jiucang Street, Nanshi, someone suddenly opened fire and shot at him. He was hit in the head by one bullet. Kabashima tried to chase the murderer, but due to his severe injuries, he died on the spot. The shooter took the opportunity to escape. According to eyewitnesses, the murderer was wearing Chinese clothing and there were three of them in total. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Military Police immediately mobilized, cut off traffic, and searched for the murderer. The Japanese garrison and police from the Japanese Consulate conducted a major inspection, but no one has been found yet. Kabashima Kikuji was from Aichi Prefecture and participated in the Nanjing and Wuhan campaigns. He was transferred to his current position on October 1st of last year.</p>
<p>Iron Gates Closed, Traffic Not Restored</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that at 10:30 a.m. the day before yesterday, Kabashima Kikuji, the captain of the Nanshi Military Police, was shot and killed at the intersection of Fuyou Road and Jiucang Street in Nanshi. The Japanese immediately implemented special security measures, closing all iron gates connecting Nanshi and the French Concession, and dispatching large numbers of military police to conduct extensive searches within the boundary. Many residents who were stranded in Nanshi or the concession were unable to return home and had to sleep on the streets. The situation was quite tragic. According to reporters' inquiries, traffic between Nanshi and the French Concession had not yet been restored as of last night. The Xinwen River, Xiaobeimen, Nanyang Bridge, Xie Bridge, Hongqiao, Tushan and other iron gates remained closed.</p>
<p>Strict Inspections Cause Anxiety</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was learned that there was a large-scale search in areas such as Republic Road yesterday. Residents were subjected to very strict questioning if there was an increase or decrease in the number of people in their households. Residents at the scene of the incident were forced to leave their homes to conduct thorough searches. The main roads of Nanshi were densely patrolled by military police, monitoring pedestrians. The situation in the former lockdown area of ​​West Shanghai has reappeared in Nanshi. Ordinary residents are panicked and feel uneasy. Yesterday, the Japanese troops stationed at the Xie Bridge iron gate once agreed to release the Nanshi residents stranded in the French Concession, but those who wanted to leave Nanshi were all prohibited. It is said that this traffic blockade will continue for three days, but this has not yet been confirmed. Due to the traffic blockade, the supply of vegetables in the French Concession has decreased, and prices have soared.</p>
<p>Nanshi Lockdown, Vegetable Prices Soar</p>
<p>Those most affected are those who live in Nanshi but work in the concession, as they are unable to work or return home. There are no fewer than thousands of them. Therefore, inside and outside the iron gates, people are crowded all day long, watching the situation. The next is the vegetable farmers in Nanshi, who usually come to the concession to sell their produce. Yesterday, they could not do so as they wished, resulting in a sharp decrease in the number of vegetable stalls in the concession, and the selling price increased accordingly. This was especially true for bean sprouts, with this type of vegetable mostly germinated in Nanshi. (What usually sells for 10 cents has doubled or more). As for local goods (greens, chives, broad beans, etc.), they could not be transported out of Nanshi, but fortunately they could arrive from Beishi, so the price only increased by 40-50%.</p>
<p>Arrested Dancer Taken to Hongkou</p>
<p>The Japanese, together with the French Concession police, arrested dancer Wang Juanjuan at No. 19, Lane 138, West Gate Road on the 22nd. The reason for her arrest is said to be that someone accused her of absconding, while others suspect her of being a spy, so the truth is difficult to know. A reporter from the Datong News Agency learned this morning that the arrested dancer Wang Juanjuan was handed over to the Japanese side yesterday after being detained at the French Concession police station and taken to Hongkou.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Issue a New Public Bond of 9 Million Yuan, with a Face Value Guaranteed by Amusement Venue Taxes, Divided into Five Types with an Annual Interest Rate of 6%</h3>

Among them, 2.5 million yuan will be reserved to offset outstanding temporary loans and funds held by the Council. The remaining 6.5 million yuan can be purchased by the public.

The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation will be responsible for the trust of bondholders. The Council is scheduled to publicly issue the bonds at the Public Bond Bank Share Department of the Finance Department at No. 209 Jiangxi Road from 10:00 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on the 28th of this month. Subscribers can obtain application forms from the Finance Department. Details can be found in the Council's announcement on this (26th) day.</p>
<p>May 30th Anniversary, Traffic as Usual</p>
<p>Since the police authorities of the two concessions adopted joint defense in May, each anniversary has passed safely, and social security has also benefited significantly. According to a statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, the number of criminal cases that occurred last week has decreased to 340, which is 34 fewer than the previous week, and 396 criminals have been arrested. This good result is very satisfactory and the best this year. As for the anniversary on the 30th of this month, in addition to taking ordinary precautionary measures, because the arrangements are meticulous, the border roads will not be blocked.</p>

<h3>Japanese Toa Shipping Company Seizes the Shanghai-Ningbo Shipping Rights, Naruto Maru Docks in Shanghai Awaiting Trial Voyage, But Has Not Yet Been Approved by the Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route has been suspended for nearly a year since the Japanese Navy announced the blockade of the coastal ports of eastern Zhejiang in July last year. Since the area was occupied by the Japanese army, shipping companies in Shanghai have sought to resume shipping. China Merchants, China Central, and the Japanese Toa Shipping Company competed for the shipping rights, and now the Toa Shipping Company has obtained them, and thus dispatched the Naruto Maru, which operates on the Yangtze River route, to operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The ship first entered the Jiangnan Shipyard dock to inspect the hull and repaint it. Now the work has been completed. On the 22nd of the month it left the dock at 5 o'clock to test the engine, and is now docked at buoy Nos. 28 and 29, awaiting orders to sail to Ningbo. It was originally scheduled to sail to Ningbo yesterday without passengers or cargo. Once the trial voyage is successful, a formal voyage will be scheduled. The manager of the company's Ningbo branch, a Japanese person, also took the ship to Ningbo to arrange everything, but until yesterday evening at around 7 o'clock, the ship was still docked at buoy Nos. 18 and 29, and there was no sign of raising anchor. It is likely that the trial voyage has been rescheduled. According to the company, the Naruto Maru is scheduled to test the Shanghai-Ningbo route within the next few days, but the Japanese Navy authorities have not yet approved the passage, so it is difficult to determine whether it can officially operate.</p>

At the request of the passengers, they drove to Chengdu Road. When they arrived at the entrance of Xiudexincun Lane on that road, the passengers ordered Wang to stop the car. Then three people entered the lane in succession. Not long after, they took a man and got into the car together, ordering Wang to drive west. Unexpectedly, when they reached Zhangjiazhai Road on Aiwenyi Road, the passengers in the car suddenly showed fierce eyes.

<h3>Educational News: Relief Funds of 1.4 Million Yuan Fully Disbursed; Education Authorities Announce Implementation Process; All Teachers and Staff in the City are Extremely Moved</h3>
<p>(Hua She) The Executive Yuan allocated 1.4 million yuan for relief funds to teachers and staff in Shanghai, which has now been fully disbursed. All teachers and staff in private registered or approved specialized schools above the college level, as well as public and private registered or approved primary and secondary schools, have received universal relief. Although the amount received by each individual is small due to the large number of recipients, it still provides a small benefit. More importantly, it offers spiritual comfort. The teachers and staff in Shanghai are deeply moved that the central government, at a time when national finances are primarily focused on military needs, was still able to allocate funds for relief, demonstrating its concern for education in Shanghai and its benevolence towards the literati. A reporter from Da Hua She, in order to understand the implementation process of this matter, yesterday specially visited the authorities stationed in Shanghai under the Ministry of Education and received the following statement:</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Approved the Allocation of 800,000 Yuan</p>
<p>After the war, prices in Shanghai soared endlessly. Since last autumn, the cost of living index has exceeded eight times the previous level. The salaries of teachers and staff in various schools were barely enough to survive. Everyone sought ways to provide relief. The party and government in this city, in addition to requesting the central government to allocate living subsidies for teachers and staff in public schools, also strictly ordered each school to make its finances public, ensuring that every penny of the school's income was used to improve the salaries of teachers and staff. Furthermore, schools were allowed to appropriately increase tuition fees to provide financial support, and the distribution standards for these increased tuition fees were clearly defined, requiring that 70% be used for the salaries of teachers and staff. Subsequently, public opinion launched a million-dollar relief campaign, appealing to the government to allocate one million yuan to assist teachers and staff in Shanghai. They also painstakingly recounted the hardships and struggles of Shanghai's teachers and staff over the past four years and the current state of their suffering, strongly requesting Minister of Education Chen to grant relief. This was then forwarded to the President for submission to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval, allocating 800,000 yuan in relief funds. When the news arrived, everyone was overjoyed. This is the origin of the 800,000 yuan relief fund.</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan Approved an Additional Allocation of 600,000 Yuan</p>
<p>After the Executive Yuan approved the 800,000 yuan relief fund, the Shanghai education administration immediately began investigation and statistical work to serve as a basis for future distribution. All public and private schools at all levels that applied for relief were included. After a month of work, the statistics were completed and reported to the Ministry of Education. Subsequently, due to the large number of teachers and staff, it was felt that 800,000 yuan, although a large sum, was still insufficient for distribution. Reluctantly, the reasons were again painstakingly explained, and Minister Chen was telegraphed to forward a request to the Executive Yuan for an additional allocation of 600,000 yuan. Fortunately, the education authorities quickly approved the request. This is the origin of the additional allocation of 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Distribution Principles and Amounts</p>
<p>After the additional allocation of 600,000 yuan was approved, the education administration, following the Ministry's instructions, invited relevant party and government personnel to jointly discuss the distribution methods. After repeated discussions, the following principles were determined: (1) Following the Ministry's instructions, 295,500 yuan was allocated for relief funds for teachers and staff in private specialized schools above the college level, to be directly distributed by the Ministry; (2) Following the Ministry's instructions, 136,000 yuan was allocated for relief funds for teachers and staff in schools that had moved to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, and later an additional 15,000 yuan was allocated, both to be directly distributed by the Jiangsu Provincial authorities stationed in Shanghai; (3) The remaining funds would be used to provide universal relief to public and private registered or approved primary and secondary schools in Shanghai, as well as public vocational and supplementary schools, and short-term primary schools and people's schools, etc., that had submitted applications, based on the number of classes, teachers and staff, and students in each school. However, the distribution standards for public schools were higher than those for private schools, because the application for living subsidies for public schools had been approved by the Executive Yuan and the Ministry, and the relief funds would be disbursed accordingly. As for the distribution standards for middle and primary schools, there were also differences due to the varying number of teachers and staff required for each class in middle and primary schools, but they still adhered to the principle of fairness. In total, the amount distributed, excluding the 546,500 yuan for specialized schools above the college level and schools that had moved to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, was 853,500 yuan for various schools in Shanghai. The amounts received by each sector of schools were as follows: (1) Public secondary schools: 99,000 yuan; (2) Public primary schools: 185,400 yuan; (3) Supplementary schools, short-term primary schools, and people's schools: 67,000 yuan; (4) Private secondary schools: 290,400 yuan; (5) Private primary schools: 198,000 yuan, totaling 839,800 yuan. The remaining 12,700 yuan will be temporarily used as a reserve fund and reported to the Ministry of Education for instructions on how to handle it. All receipts and forms will also be submitted to the Ministry of Education for review.</p>
<p>All Funds Disbursed in Three Installments</p>
<p>The large sum of relief funds was received in batches. On May 12, the first batch of relief funds, 800,000 yuan, was received. After deducting 531,500 yuan for specialized schools above the college level and schools that had moved to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, there was a remaining 268,500 yuan, which was barely enough for the initial disbursement to public schools. Originally, it was intended to disburse all funds at once after the entire amount had arrived. However, due to the urgent need for relief from the various schools, delay was not permissible, and the disbursement procedures were also extremely troublesome, making it impossible to disburse all funds at the same time. Therefore, rather than disbursing them together later, it was decided to disburse them as soon as funds were received. Thus, the public school portion was disbursed first. Subsequently, on May 18, an additional 300,000 yuan was received. After allocating an additional 15,000 yuan to schools that had moved to Shanghai from Jiangsu Province, it was sufficient to disburse to private middle schools. The disbursement was then continued. On May 22, another 300,000 yuan was received, and private primary schools and other sectors were disbursed. At this point, the disbursement process was completely concluded. The time between each disbursement and the day the funds were received was no more than three days, in accordance with the original intention of disbursing as soon as funds were received.</p>
<p>Appreciating the Benevolence and Strengthening Loyalty</p>
<p>In summary, in this large-scale relief effort, striving for fairness in principle was relatively easy, but ensuring that there were no discrepancies between each school was extremely difficult in practice. This point should be understood by the teachers and staff. As for the distribution standards for each school, they also varied according to the circumstances, making it difficult to establish a uniform standard. Therefore, a uniform standard was not established, and each school's principal, in consultation with the teachers and staff, decided on a standard based on fairness and reasonableness. All relief funds were completely distributed to the teachers and staff to provide support. Reviewing the implementation process of this matter, it was extremely complex and took half a year to complete. If it were not for President Chiang's deep concern and Minister Chen's leadership, there would not have been such a satisfactory result. The assistance provided by party and government comrades in this city was also greatly appreciated. The diligence and dedication of the staff were also commendable. It is hoped that all teachers and staff in the city will appreciate the central government's benevolence, continue to uphold the spirit of the past, strengthen their loyalty, work hard in their positions, and fulfill their missions, so that the future of the nation will truly rely on them.</p>
<p>Professor Yao Ke Lectures on Drama and Education</p>
<p>The academic lecture series initiated by the eight elders of the Shanghai academic community held its fourth lecture yesterday at the Swen Palace Theater. Professor Yao Ke lectured on drama and education, first explaining the concept of drama and education. The main idea was that all art is propaganda, and drama is an important tool for propaganda and a weapon for public education. The Chinese public has always received education from drama, so using drama as an educational tool is not a new idea. In modern China, illiteracy is rampant, and the promotion of public education is urgent. Therefore, drama education is extremely important. He then explained the value of drama education, saying that it can assist and supplement public education because (1) it is more difficult for older illiterate people to read; (2) reading and literacy are relatively boring, while drama is more interesting; (3) textbook education is abstract and indirect, while drama is concrete and direct. He then gave an overview of drama education in various countries, such as the Moscow Children's Theater and the drama group of the American Works Progress Administration, etc., saying that the results were excellent. He also said that China could take advantage of folk customs such as welcoming gods and temple fairs to achieve great results, because welcoming gods is a nationwide movement and the countryside lacks other forms of entertainment, which can be guided and improved. Finally, he elaborated on the points to be noted when organizing drama education, including (1) talent; (2) organization; (3) attention must be paid to the active participation of the public; (4) educational materials must be found from the real-life needs of the public (such as legends), novels, folk songs, social stories, etc.; (5) mass movements must be organized, etc. It was also learned that the next lecture is planned to be given by Mr. Xi Yushu.</p>

<h3>The Impact of the European War on British Banking Operations Translated by Ling Chongzhen</h3>
<p>What becomes of the banking industry during wartime? What responsibilities does it shoulder? Although our banking professionals have tasted the flavors of war for about two and a half years, it seems this question remains largely unknown. Reading this article and reflecting on our own country, especially Shanghai, one cannot help but be astonished that this question remains unanswered to this day. Frankly speaking, in theory, this issue should be "beyond discussion" and not even raised. Yet, it still seems necessary to bring it up. How can we simply dismiss it with "this is that"? What lessons should this article teach us? Hopefully, readers will not have differing opinions on this matter. (Editor)</p>
<p>At the start of the war, the British government took various actions in all areas, and they were especially prepared for any contingency in the banking system. This is not an exaggeration, as there are numerous facts to prove it. As the war crisis gradually became apparent in 1938, the British banking sector immediately assembled a delegation to discuss ways to respond to all possible events. Looking at the plans contributed by this delegation today, after the war has been going on for eighteen months, they appear even more sound and comprehensive. At the beginning of the war with Germany, the future progress was difficult to predict, so all plans had to consider the worst-case scenarios. Fortunately, until today, only a small portion of these plans have needed to be implemented.</p>
<p>In terms of the practical operations of the national bank's head office and its branches, two anticipated difficulties were the possibility of transportation disruptions and the destruction of records due to bombings. As for the large-scale conscription of male staff, this was also expected, and mechanical replacements for manpower were already in place to compensate.</p>
<p>Operating Normally During Bombings</p>
<p>The head offices of the five major British banks are all in London, and in peacetime, it takes each employee an hour to travel to and from the office. Predictably, the targets of German bombings were concentrated on London's transportation lines, so many transportation stations and lines were frequently threatened and temporarily suspended. Bank office hours were changed to 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM, and 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM on Saturdays and Sundays, while still figuring out ways to ensure that employees could arrive at the office on time.</p>
<p>Opinions varied regarding the best way to ensure that employees could arrive at the office on time, and one method is now being implemented. The head offices of the banks and the Bank of England are all bomb-proof buildings. Some bank employees who hold the keys live inside, and proper arrangements are made to provide them with food. They also take turns staying there, so that each employee can go home once every few nights to spend time with their family. Another method is to rent passenger cars to transport employees directly to and from work. These cars depart from various locations in London and the suburbs and arrive in the city before 9:00 AM every morning, and then return the employees home after the day's work is done.</p>
<p>Both of these methods are quite comprehensive, but the cost is inevitably high. The banks spend as much as one pound per week for each employee, whether they commute daily or stay in the office, but only this way can it be guaranteed that every essential male and female employee can be at their post on time.</p>
<p>As for branches in London and the provinces, so far there has been no need to implement such measures, as most employees live nearby and can get to work on time.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Check Clearing Function</p>
<p>What the banking delegation had to carefully consider was the issue of check clearing after the outbreak of war. Regarding this point, the steps they decided upon can be described as the most novel actions in history, namely, to move the London Clearing House to Stoke-on-Trent, which is 146 miles away from London, except for the check clearing equipment of the head offices and one or two other banks near the Bank of England (which is stored in the basement of the Bank of England).</p>
<p>This relocation was carried out with the most comprehensive organization, and there were no delays or obstacles in action. On a Saturday and Sunday after the start of the war, the London Clearing House temporarily closed to allow all equipment and tools, including seven hundred adding machines (Odding Macoine), to be moved to the new site, ready to resume operations the following Monday. The entire process was well-organized, and all parties involved were satisfied.</p>
<p>The inconvenience caused by the relocation of the London Clearing House was far less than expected. The entire record of each transaction was printed in duplicate by machine. In addition, other modern methods were used so that even if deposit checks were lost in transit, the business could still be processed immediately. Although the receipts were delayed by two or three days, causing a slight delay in customers' depositing of checks, the banks did not feel any inconvenience, and there were no other negative points except for the addition of some items under the transportation figures in the bank statements.</p>
<p>Bombings Cannot Stop Business Operations</p>
<p>While check clearing is guaranteed by the use of machines, the widespread application of other machines in the past decade has achieved other important results. It is a well-known fact that many bank branches in London and the countryside have been bombed, but to date, there has been no report of a bombed branch closing for the entire day.</p>
<p>Copies of seals and signatures have long been stored in safe locations; copies of all transaction records are also available at any time. When a branch is bombed, it will continue to operate the next day in the nearest branch or in a branch of another bank. Therefore, no matter how large the material losses, British banking operations continue as usual.</p>
<p>There is a rather strange fact that I would like to mention here, that is, although the buildings of most bank branches have been destroyed, the safe deposit boxes and underground strongrooms are completely unharmed. Sometimes, due to the rupture of water pipes, these underground strongrooms, which store customers' valuable securities, title deeds, and the bank's cash and important records, are occasionally flooded, but to date, there have been no reports of damage to these securities and title deeds.</p>
<p>Filling Vacancies After Staff Enlistment</p>
<p>At the time of writing this article, approximately twenty percent of the male staff of British banks have voluntarily or been conscripted into the army, and therefore cannot work as usual. If it were not for the development of machinery in recent years and the gradual reduction in the number of young bank employees, the number of employees who have had to leave their posts due to the war would have been even more considerable.</p>
<p>The vacancies left by the enlisted staff are filled half by young people aged sixteen or seventeen and half by women. Many female employees who previously resigned due to marriage have agreed to return to work during the war, so the actual number of bank employees now is not much different from before. Most women with general experience in banking operations are assigned to teller positions, and they are quite competent. In most branches, the teller work includes various different banking transactions, so it is not easy to handle without specially trained personnel.</p>
<p>Fundamental Changes and Special Measures</p>
<p>The fundamental change in banking operations brought about by this war is the virtual elimination of all foreign exchange transactions. Exchange rates no longer exist, and all transactions must go through the Bank of England, which has the right to decide whether each transfer of funds is beneficial to the country. Therefore, the foreign exchange departments of the banks in London have temporarily closed, and all the skilled personnel dismissed as a result have been reassigned to other important positions. In practice, British banks have implemented the dispersion of skilled personnel in various departments within the country so that in the event of an accident, there are skilled personnel to manage everything.</p>
<p>Major banks with main operations in London have prepared suitable premises so that they can be relocated immediately if the office cannot be used. These backup premises are basements with modern air conditioning equipment and absolutely safe locations, which can be moved into in the event of an accident. In fact, the banks' infrequently used records have already been moved in to ensure safety.</p>
<p>The amount of lending during the war has been greatly reduced, as expected. The supply of credit is limited to channels that are beneficial to the country's war effort. The nature of bank loans has changed. Loans secured by valuable securities in clearing transactions have been largely repaid, and many commercial activities have contracted due to the war, so the demand for credit has also greatly decreased.</p>
<p>The issuance of new valuable securities has been suspended for a long time. The banks are working closely with the National Supply Department and the Aviation Machinery Manufacturing Department to oversee all matters related to credit loans for working capital, raw materials, machine tools, and other needs.</p>
<p>For example, when a weapons manufacturing plant needs funds, it can apply to the general manager of the local bank. The National Supply Department and the Aviation Machinery Manufacturing Department have designated divisions to maintain close contact with the banks. When an application is received, a contract is immediately issued and given to the borrower. These two departments have great authority, and poorly managed factories can be closed down and taken over by representatives appointed by the two departments or the banks issuing credit loans.</p>
<p>The amount of credit loans issued by the banks has been greatly increased by government order to meet the needs of the national war effort. Therefore, in addition to direct loans to the government, the total amount of credit loans issued to private industries is considerable. Fortunately, all bank operators understand that striving for victory in the war is the primary goal. Private savings have been transformed into various valuable securities issued by the government, and the excess profits tax has reached 100%. This step seems unavoidable. The 100% profits tax promulgated at the beginning of the war was a major political move, but private businesses have felt increasingly difficult as a result. Therefore, from an economic point of view, this is actually an unlimited obstacle.</p>
<p>Of course, the government's weekly war expenses far exceed the amount of public bonds purchased by the public. The way to make up for this is for the Ministry of Finance to borrow directly from the banks, with so-called Treasury Deposit Receipts as collateral, the total amount of which is currently approximately £250,000,000 to £300,000,000, with an interest rate of 11/8%. In view of the entire British banking deposit capacity, this amount cannot be considered very large, but the banks naturally welcome the government's plan to raise funds for repayment and higher interest rates to reduce their losses. The increase in these deposit receipts has increased the proportion of low-yielding assets in the banks, causing concern.</p>
<p>The National Savings Committee is working hard to encourage the public to save as much as possible to support the government's war effort. The organization of this committee is quite similar to the American Liberty Loan Organizations during the last World War. The banks are a strong support, and the managers and staff of the banks in various cities in England spend most of their time working on this.</p>
<p>As for the banking industry's generous and patriotic attitude towards the war of resistance, it can be further demonstrated by their treatment of staff serving in the military. The salaries of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force are very low. For example, a single soldier receives only five jiao per day. Although those with wives and other dependents receive some subsidies, the amount is also very limited. To solve this salary problem, the banks decided to supplement the salaries of all staff serving in the military to make them equal to their salaries in the bank. In addition, the employee can also receive family subsidies from the government, so that the staff serving in the military can be at ease without worrying about their families, while also knowing that their positions in the bank will still be maintained after the war. For the banks, it does increase a lot of burden, but they see it as a contribution they should make to the country.</p>
<p>In short, the British banking industry is facing the war with a strong and calm attitude. War and the various losses and destruction it brings are not welcomed by them, but since the war has arrived, they know that they must fulfill their duties to the fullest. Bank clients and customers are also able to cooperate fully, and have never complained about the shortening of office hours and other inconveniences. In a nutshell, the public's general attitude is: "Since we are all suffering the same fate, we must work together to make the best possible outcome." (Translated from The Burroughs Clearing House Fed. 1941)</p>
<h3>Third Phase Style YQ</h3>
<p>After Japan adopted a uniform military currency and clamped down on other newly issued banknotes, the Sino-Japanese currency war seems to have eased on the surface. In reality, however, it has simply moved the battlefield from the currency realm to the price realm. This can be said to be the beginning of the third phase of the Sino-Japanese currency war. The past two phases were all active in the currency realm. The first phase focused on substituting legal tender with other currencies, such as the Allied banknotes. After this strategy failed, they shifted their focus to undermining the purchasing power of legal tender. Today, the goal of undermining legal tender in the price realm remains consistent, but the means of destruction are still limited to currency. Attempts to seize foreign exchange, like the "Huaxing Notes" attempt to "live and die together" with legal tender! This is the second phase. When it designated Central China as a "military currency circulation area" and reversed its "substitution" policy by not supporting other miscellaneous banknotes, Japan's monetary strategy towards China no longer launched frontal attacks on legal tender, but instead began its indirect, roundabout strategy from the price perspective. Now, it is in the period of trying out this strategy; this is something everyone should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>Although rising prices are not the result of the devaluation of legal tender, the result of rising prices is the devaluation of legal tender. This is a recognized fact. China's legal tender has a strong foundation and is backed by the pound sterling and US dollar. Therefore, directly undermining the purchasing power of legal tender is futile. Moreover, since it tasted the sweetness of seizing legal tender foreign exchange funds, it reversed its attitude of fearing the depreciation of the legal tender exchange rate and instead became "afraid that the legal tender exchange rate is not high enough." Therefore, on the one hand, it hopes to maintain the legal tender exchange rate at a higher level in order to seize it. On the other hand, it still attempts to suppress the purchasing power of legal tender so that it can gain an occupation right over the Chinese monetary system. In these two conflicting attempts, this roundabout strategy of attacking from the price perspective was discovered.</p>
<p>Japan discovered this strategy unexpectedly. At first, it only wanted to control materials in the occupied territories to supplement its own shortages. On the one hand, it used force to control the circulation of materials in the occupied territories. On the other hand, it issued military currency and other miscellaneous banknotes to obtain these materials without paying a price. Merchants in the occupied territories, intimidated by the threat of force, mostly compensated for their losses by raising prices. This created a situation where military currency and other currencies depreciated sharply against legal tender. In order to save the devaluation of military currency and other currencies, and to satisfy its desire to fully purchase materials in the occupied territories, it began to raise the price of military currency. Sacrificing the Japanese yen notes in China, sacrificing various affiliated miscellaneous banknotes, expanding the opportunity for compulsory circulation of military currency, and even deliberately creating speculation in military currency, all aimed at raising the price of military currency.</p>
<p>Although the attempt to expand the opportunity for compulsory circulation of military currency still failed, the means of deliberately creating speculation in military currency was extremely subtle. It created a situation of soaring military currency prices to attract those unscrupulous speculators. On the one hand, it played tricks in the speculative frenzy of soaring and plummeting prices, so that military currency, which could not compete with legal tender, actually had periods of being more expensive than legal tender, and then tried to prop up that kind of situation. The greater the degree of soaring and plummeting, the greater the possibility of attracting speculation. The more speculators attracted, the greater the possibility of military currency issuance, and the more legal tender was absorbed by it. Therefore, although the circulation range of military currency is still pitifully narrow, with the increase in the amount of legal tender it has seized, it can promote the rise in prices of materials in the occupied territories. With rising prices, the purchasing power of legal tender is invisibly reduced. It can instead obtain more materials in the rise in military currency prices, while avoiding affecting the possibility of legal tender appreciation restricting its seizure of legal tender foreign exchange.</p>

<h3>Seen, Heard, Thought</h3>
<p>Textiles are the lifeline of Japan's national economy. However, its cotton almost entirely depends on the United States. Last Saturday, the US Senate authorized the Commercial Credit Corporation to buy cotton, and also prohibited all commercial transactions of cotton until after the war. This is tantamount to expanding the scope of the embargo against Japan. The giant hand holding Japan's throat has added another layer of strength.</p>
<p>Speaking of the stakes of the textile industry in Japan's national economy, I am reminded of what I said in the past: This Sino-Japanese War can be regarded as a "Cotton War" in economic terms. The first factory opened by the first Japanese person in China was a yarn factory. The Japanese commodity that has been most vigorously marketed to China is cotton cloth. After the September 18th Incident, Japan loudly advocated "Japanese industry, Chinese agriculture," with the intention of China closing yarn factories and having Chinese farmers grow cotton for Japanese factories. Because China did not agree, Japan took action itself. At the beginning of the January 28th Shanghai War, Sanyou Industrial Company was burned down. At that time, it was the most active member of the Chinese cotton industry. The company later rebuilt in Hangzhou and the extremely popular Triangle brand towels were produced by the factory. But in this war, the first thing the Japanese army did when it arrived in Hangzhou was to seize the factory, forcing the company to switch to selling Sanyou Buwan. When this war broke out, it was the time when the Sino-Japanese yarn industry competition was at its fiercest. Most of the Chinese yarn factories in North China have changed to Japanese nationality. The Shenxin mortgage incident in Shanghai caused a stir in the city. Since the outbreak of the war, the industry in the occupied territories that has suffered the most is yarn factories. Even British yarn factories were not spared. Like the suddenly popular Lun Chang ramie yarn due to the war, it was soon caught in a labor dispute with a background and found itself in a dilemma. In the occupied territories, the first material to be controlled was cotton. The first step of China's anti-blockade policy in the Northwest was to prohibit cotton planting and ban the export of cotton. Now Japanese merchants are trying to replace Double Horse yarn with blue cloth yarn, but the disguised cotton export ban this time by the United States is enough to give the Japanese textile tycoons a headache.</p>
<p>Rice weevils are injecting air needles into the rice market again. They are expanding the "purchase and transport" air to offset the "originating from foreign rice" fact. I hope colleagues and citizens will pay attention and I also hope the concession authorities will plan ahead to manage the movement of rice to maintain the current successful rice price policy.</p>
<p>Laymen don't know how to pick goods, so they worship old brands; people in business, therefore, only ask about brands. However, the so-called old brand is nothing more than sticking to conventions and being complacent. It is indeed better than new brands that are slippery and deceptive, but it does not necessarily include the element of continuous improvement. Therefore, worshiping old brands is simply worshiping stagnation.</p>

<h3>Finance Banks in Chongqing Increase and Implement Full-Day Saturday Operations</h3>
<p>Chongqing News, There are currently 30 member banks of the Chongqing Banking Association, including the Salt Industry Bank. There are eight or nine banks that have not joined the association. There are many newly established banks. Those that have already opened include the Jianguo Bank. Those in preparation include the County Township Bank General Office, the Yangtze Industrial Bank, the Fuxing Industrial Bank, the Social Welfare Bank, the Chengdu Commercial Bank, and the Citizen Bank. This proves the vitality of finance in the rear. The four banks in Chongqing—Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank of China, and Agricultural Bank of China—and various commercial banks have, in accordance with the resolutions of the four banks' general offices, implemented full-day operations on Saturdays since mid-April.</p>

<p>New York Cotton Market, initially due to the news of the Senate passing the Smith Act, prices rose due to mass purchases, and then softened after entering the market. The closing result was an increase or decrease of one to two pounds compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Bombay Cotton Market, initially due to speculative purchases and good news from American cotton, prices rose. Then, due to long positions closing and brokers selling, prices fell back. The closing result was an increase or decrease of one to five compared to the previous day. Seventy-five, the forecast price has not been reached.</p>
<p>Another telegram, statistics of Indian cotton from September 1, last year to May 24 this year are recorded on the left (per bale of four hundred pounds).</p>
<p>Final Revised Report on American Cotton</p>
<p>Washington Telegram, The US Department of Agriculture Cotton Production Statistics Bureau released the final revised report on American cotton last year as follows (cotton field units in thousands of acres, cotton units in thousands of bales).</p>
<p>North-South Goods Cinnamon is Relatively Tight</p>
<p>Cinnamon has been relatively scarce in small sizes recently, so while the market price for large sizes has repeatedly softened, small sizes have tended to tighten. The current market price, such as Tianhong’s sales of 140 yuan, is now quoted at 150 yuan.</p>
<p>Seafood Shark Fin Prices are Firm and High</p>
<p>Shark fins have been scarce in stock recently, and the market situation is very firm and high. Net jade knot fins require 4,600 yuan, and the rest range from over 3,000 yuan to over 1,000 yuan. Even lower-grade small fins require 260 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News Old Mold Has Been Pervasive Recently, Cigarette Stockpilers Seek to Get Rid of Stock</p>
<p>The cigarette market situation these days is as dull as a wooden chicken. Because exports require export permits, plus high costs such as expenses, it is not profitable to ship to the inland, so sales are unusually sluggish. Only this street has a slight interest. The market inventory is worlds apart from sales. The mold season is in full swing, and stockpilers are seeking to get rid of stock. People's minds are weak and depressed, causing the market to present a spiraling situation. The dark market price is 1,296 yuan for the Great Britain brand, 666 yuan for the Small Fairy brand, and 671 yuan for the Five Star brand, without much gain or loss. 928 yuan for the Old Knife brand, because of its widespread sales, the price is not easy to be small. 12,295 yuan per 10,000 for fifty Great Britain brand cigarettes, 13,380 yuan per 10,000 for fifty Daqianmen brand cigarettes, and 13,378 yuan per 10,000 for ten Daqianmen brand cigarettes. The Jinshu and Meili brands have stabilized in the market, and sales have also been sluggish.</p>
<p>Medicinal Materials Anemarrhena Has Been Shipped Slightly</p>
<p>Several pieces of Anemarrhena have recently been shipped from the north. The goods are still good, but the customer's asking price is too high, so the market's counter-offer is thirty or forty yuan apart, resulting in no transaction. However, the customer still does not want to sell, resulting in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Hardware Wire Nails Have Fallen Again</p>
<p>Wire nails from this factory are oversupplied in this street. Stockpilers have been constantly releasing stock, resulting in softening. The market price has fallen again and again. The recent asking price in the market is only 160 yuan per bucket, which is more than 10 yuan lower than the previous market. The only way out for these goods (the South Seas Islands) is currently lacking in procurement methods, so very little is being shipped. And the various places in North China are also intermittently interrupted. The Yangtze River inland gangs rarely embellish, and the users of the construction gangs in this street have limited stomachs, resulting in market stagnation.</p>

<h3>Youth Health Preservation Methods</h3>
<p>— Gong Chang</p>
<p>The period of youth is one of vigorous development and also the most dangerous time in life. The length of one's life, the strength of the body, and the success or failure of one's career are all determined during this period. Therefore, health preservation during youth is especially important. Now, I will briefly list several methods of health preservation below:</p>
<p>1.  The skin should get plenty of sunlight. One should rub the whole body with cold water daily, and wear less clothing to develop a habit of cold resistance.</p>
<p>2.  The lungs should take a deep breath every morning to prevent lung disease. The doors and windows of the room should be kept open day and night to circulate the air.</p>
<p>3.  The muscles should be accustomed to labor. One should regularly engage in various sports to increase muscle development. One should also correct spinal curvature, paying particular attention to sitting and standing posture.</p>
<p>4.  The digestive system must develop good habits. One should not eat snacks in between the three meals a day. One should not overeat, but chew carefully. Brush your teeth and scrape your tongue once each morning and evening. Have a bowel movement once a day at a fixed time (preferably in the morning). If constipated, eat fruits such as bananas and pears.</p>
<p>5.  One should abstain from smoking and alcohol. Cigarettes and alcohol contain toxic substances that can invade the brain, heart, blood, etc., numbing their functions and corrupting their essence. It is imperative to abstain from them.</p>
<p>6.  One should refrain from gambling. Gambling is an improper behavior that can cultivate a侥幸 and dissolute habit in one's spirit. It causes great harm to the body, time, and economy. All young people should absolutely abstain from it.</p>
<p>7.  The reproductive desire of youth is most vigorous. The semen produced by the external kidneys contains something called "丕耳明," which is not only for the purpose of human reproduction, but also for developing brainpower, physical strength, and the functions of internal organs such as the heart, lungs, stomach, intestines, liver, and kidneys. However, young people often do not know its preciousness, shaking it, wasting it, exhausting it, and committing the disease of masturbation. This disease can be called chronic suicide. Especially on this wicked island, it is easiest to be tempted by various influences and commit this disease, giving one's entire life the greatest blow. All young people, do not commit this, otherwise, the future is in danger!</p>
<p>There are countless methods of health preservation for young people. Today, I will only mention a few, hoping that young people will take good care of themselves.</p>
<h3>A Kind of Economical, Convenient, and Hygienic Shoe</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>In the current environment, I feel that everything we have—in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation—should meet three conditions: economy, convenience, and hygiene. However, these three conditions are not easy to achieve. Often, what is economical is inconvenient, and what is convenient is unhygienic. It is extremely difficult to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>Now, I feel that a type of shoe can precisely meet these three conditions. Speaking it out, it is not that strange: cloth shoes. When it comes to shoes, they can be divided into three types: leather shoes, cloth shoes, and rubber shoes. Among these three types, leather shoes are the most expensive. A pair of ordinary goods always costs more than thirty yuan. Although they are sturdy, they can only be used for two years at most. Moreover, leather is not breathable. Wearing leather shoes for a long time can easily cause dampness and toxins. Not to mention that the raw materials for leather shoes are mostly imported! Secondly, talking about cloth shoes, there are three types of cloth shoes: silk-faced, woolen-faced, and cloth-faced. The soles are made of leather, cloth, felt, etc. In terms of lightness, leather soles are definitely the best. In terms of moisture absorption, felt and cloth soles are the best. In terms of durability, felt and cloth soles are not inferior to leather soles. As for rubber shoes, although they can be used in both sunny and rainy weather, they seem to be more convenient. However, they are not breathable, and the dampness is very serious. After wearing them for a day, when you take them off at night, the soles of the socks are often as if they have been soaked in water, which is most unsuitable for hygiene. Putting all of this together, cloth shoes are the most suitable. However, if we look at the general people in society today, they all like to wear leather shoes, especially young people. Of course, young people's aesthetic thinking is relatively developed, which is not to be blamed. However, in this time of serious national crisis, how can we bear to not be more frugal? Therefore, I hope that everyone will wear more cloth shoes that are economical, convenient, and conducive to hygiene.</p>
<h3>Should We Drink Tea?</h3>
<p>— Xi Xia</p>
<p>The habit of "drinking tea" is extremely common in our country's society. At home, when there is nothing to do, we drink tea to relieve our worries. We serve tea to guests as a courtesy, and even in remote villages, there are "tea houses." From this, we can see how popular it is. However, opinions vary regarding the effect of drinking tea on the body. Those who love tea believe that tea can help food digestion and promote the effectiveness of food utilization, so they advocate drinking tea. Opponents believe that tea contains "tannic acid," which can cause protein to coagulate and prevent the absorption of nitrogen. Since it is harmful and wasteful, they advocate drinking plain boiled water and oppose drinking tea. Everyone holds their own opinion, making it impossible for the general public to determine who is right and who is wrong. Therefore, the issue of drinking tea really needs to be studied.</p>
<p>Shennong's Materia Medica once had the following description: "Tea tastes bitter, drinking it makes people more thoughtful, sleep less, feel lighter, and have clearer vision." In terms of its composition, it contains protein, theine, tannic acid, essential oils, and amino acids. In terms of its effects, tea can quench thirst and refresh the mind, can indeed help digestion and promote growth, is a diuretic that can excrete toxins from the body, and can also bleach the decomposed products of pathological pigments, which can be called a physiological "blood purifier." However, tannic acid does indeed have the effect of inhibiting the digestion of protein, so it is best not to drink tea immediately after drinking milk or eating foods rich in protein. Finally, we can know that tea can be drunk, but it is appropriate to not make it too strong or drink too much.</p>
<h3>Native Cloth Curtains Worth Promoting</h3>
<p>— Yu Jun</p>
<p>In recent years, the general curtain supplies have mostly been imported goods, taking their delicate quality and bright and non-fading dyeing. However, this one item alone, the annual leakage, I am afraid it is not a small number.</p>
<p>In fact, the native cloth produced in our country is an excellent curtain raw material. Because throughout the year, except for a summer when thin quality is needed, the other three seasons all need curtains that are heavy and drooping and do not flutter in the slightest breeze. This one condition, with our country's native cloth, is more suitable. What is now needed is the progress of dyeing; if the native cloth can be dyed with harmonious colors, then hanging it in the glass window, its rough cloth surface can conversely cover up the ugly points of ordinary cotton fabrics, and fully show its rich and noble appearance.</p>
<p>Curvilinear and complex patterns have now become a thing of the past. What is popular in this era is simple straight-line patterns. It is naturally not a convenient thing to print complex patterns on rough native cloth. However, printing coarse-line and artistic straight-line patterns on the entire piece of native cloth, hanging it in the glass window of a three-dimensional house, matched with the three-dimensional furniture in the house, its harmonious components are definitely not the same as the imported printed foreign cloth or tweed curtains that are incompatible with everything in the East.</p>
<p>In the summer, using native cloth curtains is indeed too thick, but using high-quality summer cloth, printing some simple straight-line patterns, is it not enough to配制 curtains? Why are the big entrepreneurs who advocate domestic products unwilling to focus on this?</p>
<h3>Four Women's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Fang Shan</p>
<p>The Daxin Bookstore will hold a calligraphy and painting exhibition by four female artists: Chen Xiaocui from Hang County, Feng Wenfeng from Heshan, Xie Yuemei from Wujin, and Gu Fei from Nanhui. It is said that on this day last year, they held a joint exhibition once, causing a sensation. Compared to last year, this second exhibition is even more splendid. Xiaocui's works include about a hundred fan paintings, with landscapes and beautiful women, free and elegant, unparalleled for a time. Her imitations of Xinluo and Liuru are especially good. Occasionally, she paints orchids and bamboos, which are also graceful and ethereal. Xiaocui has a smart talent, and she is skilled in everything she learns. In addition to calligraphy and painting, she excels in poetry, lyrics, and prose. The exhibition will also sell seven volumes of Cui Lou Continued Collection, all of which are her recent works. The lady's poetry, since the separation and chaos, is even more elevated in style. The tragic places are close to Du Ling. The lyrics and music are especially dignified and beautiful, capable of inheriting Nai Weng's mantle. She is truly a remarkable woman. It is said that Wenfeng is currently ill, so there are not many works. She collaborated with Xiaocui on dozens of fan paintings, which are quite exquisite. Gu Fei is the sister of Fo Ying. She is also good at poetry. Her landscape paintings have a delicate and refined style, rich in the spirit of 　卷. Recently, she studied poetry with an old man from a famous mountain, so many of her paintings have inscriptions by the famous mountain. Her works are very rich, numbering several dozen, with works such as Listening to the Spring in Lushan being especially excellent. Yuemei is the sister of the deceased lyricist Xie Yucen. She specializes in flower and bird paintings, imitating the Song and Yuan dynasties. Her paintings are noble, elegant, and quiet. Her works are also more numerous than last year. There are three sets of calligraphy and painting screens jointly created by the three, with different tunes and the same skill. The exhibition will be held for seven days starting from May 27th. Female talents in painting are rare in the world, and the perfect combination is even rarer, so I am happy to record it.</p>

<h3>A Week's Worth of Ordinary Single-Star Home Dishes</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Since the new broad beans came out, it has not been a month, and they have already become very old. If you still stir-fry them, although you can shell them, you always feel that they are not very flavorful. Therefore, the best way is to shell them first, and then put them in the pot to stir-fry. If you want to be more particular, I will invent a ten-scenery broad bean. Use diced chicken, diced bamboo shoots, diced ham, shrimp meat, dried scallops, bean curd skin, winter mushrooms, etc., and stir-fry them with broad beans. The freshness and deliciousness of the taste are truly indescribable, but the cost is also considerable. The ordinary way to do it is still to stir-fry broad beans with pickled vegetables and bamboo shoots, or broad bean sand with green onions, and broad bean sand with pickled vegetables, which is also not bad. Because it is fresh broad beans, it feels much more delicious than broad bean sand made with dried broad beans.</p>

<h3>A Public Medical Problem</h3>
<p>— Xi Nan</p>
<p>Starting from the Aspect of Providing Diagnosis and Medication</p>
<p>There are three major problems in society: one is the food problem, one is the fuel problem, and one is the medical problem. Everyone knows to pay attention to food and fuel, but because illness is not something everyone has, there are fewer people paying attention to the medical problem. In fact, the medical problem for human life sometimes even exceeds the two problems of food and fuel. It is true to say that obtaining it means life, obtaining little means death, and losing it by a hair's breadth leads to a great error. However, people nowadays would rather not get sick. Once they get sick, not only is there immense mental suffering, but the loss of work time goes without saying. This medical bill is especially considerable.</p>
<p>Chinese medicine has risen seven, eight, or nine times due to the blockage of sources, and there is even no goods at any price. Western medicine, due to the European war and the impact of foreign exchange, has risen again and again and again from the Shanghai war to the present. It cannot be measured by common sense. Not to mention anything else, even gauze and cotton have risen eight times more than before the war. It is common for Western doctors to charge twenty yuan, even ten, for a house call. Outpatient visits cost four, six, or eight yuan, which is not considered a big deal. Chinese medicine outpatient visits cost two yuan or four yuan, which is also considered minimal. A dose of Chinese medicine costs seven, eight, or more than ten yuan, which is said to be ordinary; some are even more expensive, costing dozens of yuan, which is not surprising. The cost of Western medicine is even more needless to say! The cost of an injection of ten gold is not surprising. It is said that a shot of diphtheria antitoxin costs ninety yuan. A child next door, suffering from diphtheria, was admitted to the hospital at nine o'clock and died at ten o'clock in the afternoon, costing as much as a thousand yuan. It is often heard from people who have recovered from illness in the hospital that it costs two or three thousand yuan, four or five thousand yuan, which is enough to scare people. May I ask the current working class, working diligently day and night, is it not enough to support their families? Unfortunately, unfortunately, and unfortunately, if they are also visited by the evil disease demon, not to say that it will break the middle-class family, it is simply at a loss. Apart from relying on their own resistance to fight the disease demon, there is no other way. If they want to consult a doctor and take medicine, they must think twice. May I ask, even ants cherish their lives, how can people be willing to sit and wait for death? However, when people reach a helpless situation, where do they have the money to hire a doctor? Even if they hire a doctor, they do not have enough money to buy medicine. People will not know this situation unless it happens to them. If they put themselves in their shoes, they will not only shudder, but also feel extremely miserable!</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I met Gong Zhenqu, a colleague from the Commercial Daily fifteen years ago. I talked to him about the medical problem. I said: You are in charge of providing medical diagnosis and medication (Gong is the director of the Charity Department of the Buddhist Pure Karma Society). According to your experience, what is the medical problem now? Mr. Gong said it was difficult! difficult! I said: What is the difficulty? He said: Medicine is too expensive, and people are too poor. I said: Everyone knows that medicine is too expensive; what does being too poor have to do with the medical problem? He said: Because people are poor, they feel that the medical problem is particularly serious: It also makes the medical diagnosis and medication we provide more serious! I said: What you said is a bit mysterious! I can't figure it out. He said: From the time I started the Charity Department of the Buddhist Pure Karma Society, it has been fifteen years. I have only seen more and more people coming for diagnosis every day. Not to mention before, last year alone, there were 27,170 Chinese medicine calls, 23,882 Western medicine calls, and 15,537 free calls for the extremely poor (waiving the two-corner registration fee). In total, there were 66,593 calls. More than 42,600 doses of Chinese medicine were dispensed. Western medicine is not included. You can imagine that this number is already considerable. This year is even worse. There are always more than two hundred calls coming for diagnosis every day. At this rate, will it not exceed 70,000 calls? I said: Indeed. He said: This is precisely because people are poor. In the past, most of those who came to the diagnosis department were the so-called poor families. Now, those who are usually called small and medium-sized bourgeoisie, squeezed by the rising prices in recent years, are not enough to supply their lives. When they encounter illness, they have to abandon their vanity and come to us for diagnosis. Our career has indeed developed! However, our funding has encountered great difficulties. The price of medicine has risen seven or eight times, and the expense has also expanded seven or eight times. The number of people coming for diagnosis has also increased by thousands. Both sides are expanding at the same time, but the source of funds has not increased. Do you think it is difficult or not?</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) Tangible Friendship</p>
<p>"Could it be that he didn't arrange for me first and go to Shunde with Old Yuan?" He couldn't help thinking like this. "But even if he went to Shunde, there should be a letter!" He really couldn't figure out the reason.</p>
<p>This afternoon, Yu Kun came again, revealing a very excited look as soon as he entered the door.</p>
<p>"Old Er, it really worked out! He waved a newspaper wrapped in his hand at Begonia and said nonsensically, "What a Seventh Master Yuan, really good friend! Ji Zhaoxiong that kid was actually done by him!"</p>
<p>Begonia stared with one right eye, not understanding what he was saying for a moment.</p>
<p>Yu Kun turned around like the wind and gently closed the door. In fact, those nurses also knew that the patient in room seven was a bit strange. Shao Wen and Yu Kun's two requests for the nurses to leave had made them wary and they were unwilling to stand in the ward and hinder other people's conversations anymore.</p>
<p>"Look! It's very clearly published in the newspaper." Yu Kun quietly came to Begonia's bed, opened the newspaper with both hands, and kept it about a foot away from Begonia's face, just enough for him to see the words on the newspaper clearly without having to reach out himself.</p>
<p>Begonia first looked up with his right eye and saw that it was a "Beijing Morning Post" published three days ago.</p>
<p>Yu Kun also knew that he only had the eyeball of one eye left, so he quickly moved his hands down a little, just enough for him to see the news section he wanted him to see. (115)</p>
<h3>·This Time, This Place· Excellent Training Institute</h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>To turn people into "pillars," one must first be knowledgeable and well-versed in the classics: Doing anything with the title "Doctor" or "Master" is guaranteed to be worth three times as much, and business will flourish!</p>
<p>Thinking of this, strolling on the street and learning seem to be unrelated; in fact, as long as you read the "articles" of the plaintiffs, you can understand. These "articles" are all-encompassing: English is English, French is French, and Chinese is Chinese; there are also parallel prose, eight-legged essays, astronomy, geography, comics, and minor tunes, everything is available. Among them, minor tunes must be "taught personally" by the plaintiff, so as not to make future "learning useless."</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Secondly, invigorating the spirit is also one of the urgent tasks at hand. A spiritless person cannot be a hero. A great man must have the spirit of sticking out his chest, sticking out his belly, and making continuous efforts!</p>
<p>Where to learn it? The movie theater.</p>
<p>Those who usually disdain "fighting" must bravely go forward and "sacrifice" a bit when buying tickets; those who are usually accustomed to dozing off must flick their eyes and shake their bodies when crowded. The best result may be the general mobilization of the spirit here; therefore, even a "consumptive ghost" will uncontrollably sing out loud when he sees it, or at least scream strangely.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Next, physical exercise is more important than eating.</p>
<p>Exercising in the wilderness? No. Exercising in the park? No. Even Zhuge Liang cannot guess it: In the dog racing field, the Jai Alai field, and the dance hall!</p>
<p>Dog racing, people are dogs; playing Jai Alai, people are balls; dancing, people are waltzes, fox trots.</p>
<p>And running, jumping, startling, and palpitating, with the head and neck turning in all directions, and the hands and feet dancing, isn't this enough exercise?</p>
<p>There is also proof: People who often go to the above three places have particularly big bellies!</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Determination is second only to physical exercise; and it is best to be as firm as iron nails pounded into eighteen layers of hell.</p>
<p>Mahjong cards, roulette, old man loves to die... Losing everything but a pair of pants, pawning the pants to try to win back.</p>
<p>The will remains unchanged throughout!</p>
<h3>"Economic News"</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>When I was studying at school, I always liked to pick up the newspaper and read some sports news and education news first when I went to the reading room at home or during class breaks every morning. Next were political news, social news, and economic news.</p>
<p>Recently, I accidentally talked to a friend who already had a family burden. He said that his interest in reading newspapers has changed recently; the attention that he originally liked to read the most, sports news, has now shifted to economic news.</p>
<p>He said: I immediately open the newspaper and read the economic news every morning when I get up. I see some "Rice prices tend to rise due to hoarding by unscrupulous merchants," "Coal briquettes prices soar after being monopolized," "Oil prices hold steady, waiting for the rising wind to stop," and... In fact, these do not arouse reading interest, but you have to read them.</p>
<p>I felt dark in my heart when I heard about the shift in his attention to reading newspapers.</p>
