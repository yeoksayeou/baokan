<h3>史汀生向全國呼籲　利用海軍護送軍火　美為保護自由必須不惜犧牲　英大西洋控制權有關美安全</h3>
<p>華盛頓　陸長史汀生、昨夜向全國廣播演說、主張立刻利用美海軍使軍火能安全經過海洋運交英國、史氏演說之初、對呼渠為好戰者、及反對美國目前之國防努力者、予以答覆謂、「世界大戰後多年內、余煙以公民與國務卿資格、竭力經營、欲在各國間樹立法律治權、庶各國間爭執得應用司法方法以代武力而解決之、此種運動、一度似極有希望、今者此種時間暫已過去、而吾人之和平希望、已被國際間侵略所擊破、世界現遇極大危機、吾人之一切努力、必須轉向防衛我國安全方面、因此之故、余今晚縱談此危機、及吾人應付危機之防務、一九三三年、在希特勒率領下之一羣佔獲德國政權而推翻德意志共和國、若輩無論在德國內外、均將時間倒退五世紀以上、目實行其公然宣佈的　征輹全世界之計畫、為達此目的計、若輩以強迫勞役為基礎、秘密建立龐大之軍事機構、業已攻佔奧地利·捷克·波蘭·挪威·丹麥·比利時·盧森堡·法國·羅馬尼亞、匈牙利·保加利亞及南斯拉夫、並將此十三國人民淪於納粹暴政下之半奴隸善、另有兩國亦抱軍事征輹之目的者、依附於軸心如附庸然、即義國與日本是、義國之罪行、為無端攻擊阿比西尼亞、阿爾巴尼亞與希臘、日本之罪、為無端攻擊其鄰邦中國、若輩如此侵略、已摧毀黑暗時代後、在歐洲逐漸樹立之泰西文明、吾人與此等突發事件、關係至為密切、其遺禍於不幸的歐洲之疆界內外也、有非吾人所能蓋悉者、自由之滋長、歷時久而穩定、吾人初以為自由不久將為整個世界所公認之制度、乃納粹統治者、突將自由推倒、加以摧殘、而擬在世上建立以自己為主、他人為奴之秩序、若輩在領土內、不容個人自由權利之存在、在領土外則不許他國獨立權利之容留、無論國內與國際法律、均遭其擊倒、若輩以秘密警察代法律、使個人自由、在秘密警察狠毒的恐怖主義下、不得安全、此即吾人今日所遭遇之所謂新秩序也、若輩已公然宣布與吾人及吾人秩序相敵對、並逐漸包圍我四西半球、其先遣特務份子已在我國南面各共和國中活動、設立有戰略性之航空綫、貫通南美洲極重要各部份、蜿蜒進至我方巴拿馬運河、其武裝軍隊刻正威脅西半球欲在一躍而達巴西海岸之處、覓一起足之點、其宣傳人員已在我本國人民中大肆活動、希特勒及其軍事輔弼、有機必乘、手段巧妙、利用其權力、以不容異族與憎恨他人之反動主義、諄諄灌入於青年人未成熟之心靈中、復乘現代科學之利、於他國甜睡時、秘密練成力量空前之機械化軍隊、更利用種種虛僞與宣傳方法、使他國不備而遭其突然攻擊、今若輩且傲然迫使世人連吾人在內、循兩途之一而行之、即屈辱投降、或不與妥協而被迫抵抗是、余不憶美國在其歷史中、曾否對此要求屈服、茲請思索我國政策有無變更之必要、第一點、希特勒之所謂新秩序、並非新奇、亦決不能在此世界上樹立秩序、野蠻而國無法紀之希特勒政權、不過人類悠久進間或發生的暫時反動力之一耳、自數百前年前、有人類以來、抱野心者、曾屢圖征服全世界人類之自由、但從未獲歷久之成功、往昔如斯、今後亦然、希特勒乘大戰後混亂時期中人心不滿之機會統治生性馴服而曾一再服從專制政權放棄其實愛的自由之國民、並巧遇本來易於防杜的許多意外事件致克崛起、而保衛自由者多因稍一不愼、致在緊急時期、慘遭殺害、但人類終將以新精神及過去不幸的經騐而得之新智識、再循自由之途進展、如前所有者然、若因驚恐而信希特勒已樹立永久的世界新秩序、則非僅可晒、抑且可鄙矣云、史汀生續述其美海軍全力援英之建議稱、吾人建告並維持海軍已歷多年、若在今日、我海軍使我方軍火安然經過海軍運交英國、則海軍為我國家及保持我國之自由服務者、實與其在光榮歷史上之服務同樣偉大、美海軍補助英海軍之努力、即能保全美洲四周海洋之安全、如是卽可遏制納粹主義之狂潮、以待各民治國其他防衛力之完成、最後乃可永久阻止、極權者殘忍軍隊之肄其淫威、使之歸於敗亡、而助成自由成自由潮流之再度高漲、但若吾國遲至英海軍與國民之力被擊破時始予援助、而美海軍今所能為者、將立卽減至甚小而極不重要之程度、吾人若許目前之緊要而蹉跎過去而坐視英海軍力量之消失、則我海軍僅將成次要之力量、而不復能在世界爭鬥中居於舉足重輕之地位矣、吾人今已抱審決心、循旣定方針進行至今矣、總統已發言論與呼籲、說明吾人遭遇之危險矣、大多數國人對於總統在國會所發之呼籲、已均予以響應矣、吾人已確定為作戰民治國之後盾、以抗侵略國面防衛吾人之自由矣、吾人更已供給價值千萬之軍火以進行此防務矣、吾人手中且握有能使此等步驟奏效之工具矣、際此時期、豈謂美國人民尙可容許此緊要時期蹉跎過去、畏縮不前而聽此等軍火沉於大西中乎、我國有史以來、並無此種假定竟告實現之前例、美國政府或人民、絕無一次使人相信此種不負責任與毫無決斷之行動、為可能者、德方刻在北大西洋實施之無限制潛艇戰、不發警告即擊沉船隻、且不拯救船員員生命、按照海戰規例、此種潛艇戰、並非合法之封鎖、美國從未承認其為合法、美國發言人前在國際會議已一再作此潛艇戰、形同海盜行為、一九一七年間美總統與國會執戈以保持海洋之自由者、即此無限制潛艇戰之破壞法律不顧人道所促成也、希特勒非但撕毀國際公法之條規、抑且擴張其不法活動至西半球、我政府刻正謹愼將事、但為我國本身防衛計、對於海洋中之不法侵略、必須加以限制、總統已有吾人必不許吾人已取的步驟、成為無效之言、余並不輕言吾人所遇之危險、今乃必須嚴肅應付而非抑鬱或沮喪之時、余憶研究軸心國之軍事高爾夫、並不低估其士兵作戰之勇敢、但我國人民之發動力與才能及其勇氣、亦為余所能知、余已熟知我國海陸軍領袖現所籌擬之國防計畫、祇須吾人求以敏捷手腕與團結精神、余信其結果必堪滿意也、我國之自由為無價之寶、人有以為無須犧牲而可保全此自由者、但余則非其人、不犧牲而欲保全自由必不可得、億兆年來人類之得慘淡經營艱苦徐緩達於更好而更人道之文明者、非無所犧牲而能致也、今日德國有少數惡人、以摧毀他人與他國之自由、誨其青年、而此青年、竟準備為此邪惡之信念而死、茍吾人不準備犧牲、不準備為保全美國自由之信念於必要時殺身成仁、則吾國之自由將莫可保全矣、保全自由之唯一方法、祇有準備犧牲耳、</p>
<p>史汀生詞中、曾言及美國防務所賴以防禦重大危險之戰略上狀態謂、美國人民大獲地理之福、東西有兩大洋、南北有友邦、友邦意旨與威力、吾人不以為畏、吾人所注重者、厥為海防、大西洋介乎歐美、太平洋價乎歐亞、足可予吾人以保護、茍此大洋永在吾人自己或友好的管轄之下、洵為莫可分裂之限界、而與任何侵略國所可編制之任何陸軍相隔絕、顧海洋之友好的管連權、乃極重要之條件、茍無此條件、則大洋轉瞬即變為對我進攻之坦途、近代空權之發展、已使海洋之友好管轄權愈成必要、今吾人不獨須控制毘連我海岸之海洋大道、且須控制環綫西半球之整個海洋大道、蓋若具有強大陸軍下空軍之敵國、一旦能在我國南面或北面之弱小鄰國海岸登陸、則吾人所享之安全、將不復存在也、敵國至是、不難在距我國工業城邑一般可及之處、設立其空軍根據地、而我國至是、其所可防禦外侮者、唯有自己維持龐大陸軍力、足控制自己界外數千哩美洲大陸者之重累難堪的方法耳、此種狀態、將使美洲共和國間現所有之實中鄰關係、一變而為西半球所不願有的武力支配之惡制度、換言之、四周海洋之友好的管轄權、對於美洲國家、乃美洲現有的互相獨立與自由條件、百餘年來、大西洋管轄權、向由英國艦隊行之、因一九二二年之華府條約、英國自動允與美國平分此權、從此美國得與英國有同等管轄權矣、英美同文、其自由之傳統觀察亦同、而我國人民與英人同種者、佔什五以上、故吾人視英國為吾人安全與生活所賴的海防中之最重要因素、此即以前百餘年來狀態中之特色、吾人在此百年中、依此狀態調整我國生活、吾人未維持強大之常備軍、吾人在海岸造成人烟稠密之城市、而此城市固易受來自大西洋之攻擊也、一言以蔽之、吾人所採取的國民生活之方式、係依賴英國海權之賡續、而英國海權乃吾人對之不感惶慮者也、今日則此種局勢已大受威脅矣、英倫三島為抵拒強暴國家輕大西洋北部而趨向我國海岸之堡壘者、今已受天空攻擊與海上封鎖之威脅矣、如英政府因絕食或因被攻而傾覆、則英國艦隊縱能生存、亦將苦無充分根據地以發揮其威力矣、遇此環境、我國艦隊亦將不能充分保護西半球以拒強不可當之海權矣、即在今日、吾人噸數猶不敵軸心國合併之總數、若敵方具有造船力之優勢、則環境吾人四周之海洋、終將轉入其掌握中矣、尤有言者、吾人今僅開始造其軍事與天空防務耳、至少須有兩年、始能有充分陸軍與空軍、以禦軸心國在握有海權時、可進攻我國之天空與陸地軍隊也、十個月前、吾人即着手籌備天空與陸地之防務、其進行尙堪滿意、惟在此面積廣大之國中、非至少兩年、不能訓成力足抵禦德國六年養成的空軍陸軍之軍隊、時間為重要因素、如海權一旦喪失、則時間永不可得、今日英海軍在北大西洋地中海與馬來已受威脅、按此分佈各處之英艦、即使吾入獲有寶貴時間之唯一要素、凡此事實並非新穎、如吾人肯稍留心、則此事實固顯露於吾人目前也、我政府之政策、動機在此、而我國人亦了解此動機而贊助政府所採之途徑、於是國會不獨通過鉅額國防經費案、且通過租借案為英國等後援焉」云、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>美國內人士對此各方意見不相同</p>
<p>華盛頓　陸軍部長史汀生上校之演說、主張美國護航援英物品赴英、雖已引起抱不干涉主義之參議員劇烈抨擊、但政府方面似將對史氏之演說甚表贊許、因政府方面主張更有效援英之情感、亦不斷增高也、尼瓦達民主黨參議員麥卡蘭稱、「據國務卿所表示之意思、即謂吾人有參加戰爭之權能、但吾人所有之海軍實力、並非係用以威脅世界之實力、而係用以昭告世界、謂吾人不懼侵略、吾人應首先防衛美國、而海軍實力應視為神聖而不可犯、如吾人分化此項力量、則吾人將而為弱」云、印第安那民主黨參議員蓋氏稱、「余極力反對」、伊達和民主參議員葛賴克宣稱、「史汀生應守渠之所謂、我國之海軍、乃吾人之第一道防綫、而不能以海軍為吾人之第一道進攻綫、」愛鄂瓦州民主參議員基烈特則謂、史氏之演說、係表示對於美國人民完全缺乏坦白與公道、此即為過去數月美國外交政策之特徵云、（七日合眾社電）</p>

<h3>遠東局勢展望</h3>
<p>歐洲的戰火已隨着伊拉克事變蔓延到東方，日本也己從蘇聯方面獲得了北顧無憂的保障，然而太平洋上，却依然保持着寗靜，在最短期間，似乎尚無發生突變的徵候。</p>
<p>松岡赴歐之行，關於加强三國同盟一點並無顯著的增進，相反的，日方最近所最表關切的不是軸心力面的利益，到更是其切身的種種問題，松岡遊美之說，邀美當局赴日之議，其是否具有現實的意義姑不具論，却顯然和　國締盟的本意相違反。當去秋那一盟約甫經締結之時，日方輿論曾有一度囂張，甚至近衛松岡都有過對美不惜一戰的大言。時主今日，日方所葸葸顧慮的蘇日外交僵局已有相當打開，軸心國在歐戰也獲得新的勝利，日本處境無疑的較去年秋冬之際有利，其態度却遠為矜持，就日當局最近態度觀察，如果武斷說太平洋風暴不致掀起固屬謬妄，至少此一危機並未比較前些時候更加切迫。以日方最近處境言：對華戰事未能結束，蘇聯力謀分離德日關係，以至松岡此度赴戰所親自見聞，也許都足以促成日當局的轉趨持重，而此中最大的癥結，當無過於目前的國際局勢，有以使日當局重溫其和平拓展的夢想。</p>
<p>南進之爲日本國策，原屬無可置疑，其究將採取伺種步驟則全爲另一問題。好戰黷武固屬侵略軍閥的通性，但不戰而勝，却是所有野心擴展者的最高埋想。尤其在已爲久戰所困的國家，並不一定把發動新的戰爭視爲可喜；以納粹武力之强，其經營巴爾幹，且直到最後關頭始不得不以兵力從事，其他更可概見。日當局最近曾一再表示願以武力以外的手段滿足南進欲望，這可能眞正是日閥內心的要求。尤其當歐局日形緊張之際，美國注意力泰半爲大西洋彼岸事變所牽引之際，當不願遠東方面史形多事，這一情勢，也就是日方幻想所寄託。加以蘇日締約之後，法日及荷印與日本，又都相繼締結商務協定、如果這一外交路綫可以繼續發展，則戰爭未必一定是南進所必須採取的步驟。</p>
<p>然而就美方最近動態觀察，上述幻想顯然是落了空。去冬美總統羅斯福曾經表示：美國即使被牽人太平洋方面的戰爭，亦必不致妨礙其對英國的支援，當時曾有人加以訕笑，認爲空言無裨實際；但是近來經過事實的試驗，證明了美國的決心與實力確足與羅氏表示相符合。固然，遠束問題之未能在歐戰擴大之前獲得澄淸是一個重大遺憾，但美當局之始終鄙棄綏靖政策，不肯對侵略者稍假顏色，正是其賢明過人的地力。最近美方參戰護航之聲高唱入雲，即在政府當局亦已不再諱言，本月四日羅斯福總統紀念威爾遜的演說，史汀生陸長主張以海軍實行護航的要求，都表示着美國對於歐局已達到不能繼續容忍坐視的程度，並已站到戰爭的邊沿。但是同時其於遠東，也始終保持一貫的積極政策，其援華設施近已達到空前强度，此後或更有加無已，美朝野一般輿論，更從未對太平洋稍有忽視，國會中的論調甚且比較對歐更形急切。就這些事實來看，再加以美國實力强大之並世無匹，可以斷言即使美國眞的不幸牽入歐戰漩禍，其對於遠東必能以充分實力做有備無患的警戒。這種趨勢，一部分出於美國擁護民治主義反對侵略暴行的根本信念，另一方面，又是保持自身權益的必要措施，無論虛聲恫嚇，抑或甘言誘掖，都不會使之發生任何動搖。</p>
<p>日本既無悔禍誠意，美方更不肯輕蹈綏靖政策覆轍，是以和平解決美日懸案的要求只能是一個幻想。最近太平洋上稍見寗靜雖屬事實，但這一寗靜之下却依然隱藏着厝火，其前途變化主要還要看整個國際前途的變化。</p>

<h3>英國會集會　艾登報吿戰局　巴爾幹戰事失敗原因　歡迎美援英偉大步驟　上院通過信任政府案</h3>
<p>倫敦　英外租艾登昨在下院開始關於戰局之辯論、其聲明之要點爲（一）外傳英軍參謀部與中東總司令間對於遺軍援希事發生異見之說、實屬含有惡意之消息、並無一字眞確、（二）南非首相斯末資親蒞開羅、囑代聲明渠本人亦極贊同援希之決定、（三）南國在政變以前、未迅速進行動員、直至政變後、始眞正着手秣馬厲兵、然已嫌爲時過晚、不及遏制德軍之疾進、（四）　鑒於土國政治家之忠貞友誼、及其維護主權及利益之決心、有深切印象、渠知土國對英盟好之忠貞、確爲土國外交政策之基礎、（五）渠甚歡迎美國決定遣共船隻經過紅海之重要步驟、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>艾登發言之初　揭破納粹陰謀</h3>
<p>艾登於發言之初、向下院報告新近所發生的全部事件、尤其是近東戰事之困難、謂「在此辯論中所言者、不獨吾人聞之、他人亦皆聽之、余本願多所陳述、但爲勢所迫、目前不能　之、余不得不約略其共詞、庶免爲敵所聞、助其活動、當一月初期、德方已集大軍於羅馬尼亞、且陸續秘密進兵於保加利亞、此在英政府觀之、似爲德方春初用兵之計劃、德方便衣兵紛入保境、在飛機塲佔據地位、其目的顯然欲於旣用其方　爲吾人所共知者以佔領羅國後逐步蹂躪巴爾幹半島、深入保國、包圍南國、制服希臘、並使土國不敢動彈、如是據此地位不發一彈、即可從其穩固的根據地、向吾人在東地中海之地位予以主要之打擊、德方此種計劃當然有一副作用、即援助在阿爾巴尼亞作戰不利之義軍是、希特勒向人稱述義軍作戰之如何勇敢、並謂渠因義軍擊敗希臘、已向義軍致賀、要知以四千五百萬人擊敗七百萬人、如此稱賀、其侮辱義國也、殆無以復加、希軍在阿爾巴尼亞之戰役、雖得我空軍之輔助、然以人數較多戰具較優者相周旋、凡覜察此戰者、皆必有以寡敵衆所向披靡前無其匹之感想焉、</p>
<h3>履行援希義務　北非停止深進</h3>
<p>二月八日我軍入北非班加齊後、苦戰多時、不可不稍事休養、重行配備、蓋此路裝甲軍隊不獨絡繹挺進兩月不已、且多作戰兩月餘而未稍有休息也、旣陷班加齊後、殊無再令其繼續前進之可能、如謂此路應長驅直入以達特里波里、此殊不甚問題、吾人原來計劃爲攻克杜白魯克後停止前進、而與西翼軍隊相會合、嗣因此路軍事旣若是之順利、而敵軍之士氣又若是之頽喪、吾人乃有乘勝進取班加齊之決定、當時尚有一事須加考慮者、爲班加齊港之暫時不可利用、而須費若干時間以修治之、此時如再深進、則須以杜白魯克之小港爲根據地、然此港雖佳、究嫌過小、吾人勢須以尼羅江口爲主耍根據地矣、二月八日英政府接希政府來文、內述希政府對德抗戰之決心、並請英政府示以所可給予之援助及英國給予援助之條件、希政府此文並非乞助、但說明其立塲、並請吾人亦說明吾人之立塲耳、英政府在此情勢下、決定維持前巳決定之辦法、停止班加齊沙漢地之深進、而準備出兵援希、此乃英政府亦其主要人員所決定者、當時形勢顯有準備一切從速往援之必要、而許多難題如南國之地位、及與吾人計畫通知土國之需要等事、尚待討論與解決、政府以爲最善步驟、厥惟直接談判、於是英軍參謀長與余、乃奉命出發、余等二人皆自知其使命不易有完全成功、德方布置之如何周密、其實力之如何强大、吾人固深知之、但余知吾人苟不勉力爲之、則吾人應負責焉、</p>
<h3>聯希抗德計劃　南非獲得同意</h3>
<p>自法國戰力崩潰後、中東英軍乃獨自應付局勢而無法軍之助、該處英軍原來在比較上數額不大、而尤不幸者為配備之奇缺、去年秋初、英政府對於中東局勢深致關切、自華維爾將軍返國與首相商榷後、政府決計冒險增强中東陸軍、從此裝甲軍隊戰具飛機等陸續運出、華維爾與奧康諾兩將軍之能在沙漠地行軍中獲如此顯著戰果者、即賴此配備與戰具之力也、以我國內配備言之、此種決定極爲冒險、自茲而後、吾人源源不斷以戰士與戰具運往中東、法國傾覆以來、對土供給與對希担保兩種義務之履行、全由吾人肩負之、我軍旣抵開羅後、我方總司令三員一致贊同倫敦所生張之政策、吾人在原則上已決定所頒遣發之陸地軍隊、而軍隊集中之準備亦在進行中、吾人一致決定進兵雅典、惟地中海總司令克寗漢時方在瑪太班海戰中與敵艦相周旋、未曾參加此項決定、希王與希相皆已明白宣布希臘決計抗德與抗義同、希相且聲明縱不得外援、希臘亦必保衛其疆土、吾人在討論時會將吾人所知之德方計劉、爲希政府告、卒決定置英希聯軍於哈里克芒陣綫以拒德軍、雙方軍事專家對此迅速成立之決定、完全同意、其時吾人且徴求斯末資將軍之意見、斯末資爲賢明政治家、亦爲極有經騐之軍事家、應余之請來游開羅、渠對此決定極表同意、渠已在其對衆言論中聞明此點、囑余宜布其同意」云、</p>
<h3>南軍倉卒應戰　軍事失敗原因</h3>
<p>艾登至是乃宣讀希政府近致英政府一電、對英軍對希之忠勇援助表示感謝、並聲明願在英帝國之側繼續奮鬥、至獲取勝利及恢復自由道德興國際公道之日而後已、艾登繼言及南國謂、「吾人抵南時、吾人得種種保證、謂必拒抗德國對南之侵略、但余以爲徒作此言無補於事、所亟需者爲共同計劃、庶戰事發作時、吾人有禦敵之最好機會、余屢以此爲言、但直至政變時終無效果、當談話時、南政府屢謂南國陸軍正在動員中、吾人每向南政府陳說事宜急辦、遲則不及時、南政府輒答稱現已動員、事急時當已有準備、其實南國動員並未儘速進行、迨政變發生後、新政府始眞正整飭軍備耳、然已過晚，不及調集其軍隊於必要之處矣、故南軍雖極驍男、然倉促應戰而無有效之方略、終未能阻止德軍直衝塞維亞南境而至瑪那斯蒂山隘也、雖事後追論無濟於事、但若政變前之南政府能如西摩維樞之明白瞭解南國眞正利益、則今日事態定異於是、惟南國人民所表示之毅力、不因此而受影響、吾人旣作挽回南國獨立之保證、吾人定將尊重此諾言、」</p>
<h3>土國對英友誼　必能維持不渝</h3>
<p>「吾人在中東時、吾人常有與土國政治家談話之機會、土政府獲聞吾人對希之計劃、余對於土國政治家對英表示之忠貞友誼、及土國人民維護國家權益之堅强決心、深爲感動、自開戰以來、土國以其獨立政策大有助於吾人、土國爲防禦中東此後侵略之中堅、其地位之重要顯然可見、余確信其對英盟好之忠貞、定永爲土政府外交政策之基礎、」</p>
<h3>英決對伊拉克　維護條約權利</h3>
<p>艾登後言及伊拉克謂、「拉希德阿里蓋蘭尼之非法行爲、前已使之失勢、今復强奪政權、英政府於此未見有伊拉克此種事件可剝削英國所有條約權利之理由、英國在其應付阿刺伯人、尤其是應付伊拉克歷史中、未有可愧之紀錄、使伊拉克得獨立者厥爲英國、而助其立國並保守諾言者亦爲英國、余願以吾人目前立塲昭示世界、吾人對於土埃兩國政府之提議調解、至爲感謝、今吾人之立塲、以哈巴尼雅軍隊之撤退與對英軍敵對行爲之停止、爲調解之先決條件、如能辦到、則英政府準備討論其條約權利之履行、英國在任何環境中、必保持此權利、義國報紙久已希望英國失利、庶義國可控制北非等處之阿刺伯人土地、此爲任何阿刺伯人所應知者、在娩近歷史中、殘暴治權未有甚於我國所施諸特里波里與西列內加兩處阿刺伯人者、至於希特勒亦不彼善於此、星期日希特勒曾告世人、彼乃巴爾幹半島中有關係之旁觀人、按此旁觀者、其治權實以軍威與秘警爲根據也、阿刺伯人當知軸心國治權之來臨、即爲其自由之消滅、」（轉接第五版）</p>

<h3>遠東局勢已臻嚴重　各方仍力圖緩和　美國對太平洋未嘗忽視　日本雅不欲作孤注一擲</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報社評云、昨日來自東京·華盛頓·　紐約及巴達維亞之電訊、足以使遠東之局勢愈近焦點、蓋遠東之局勢、在最近數星期來、徘徊於樂觀主義與失敗主義之間、此等電訊、如若無訛、則就和平之希望論、局勢甚為嚴重、但亦不能遽認太平洋中之和平、殆已絕望、</p>
<p>期望局勢免趨嚴重</p>
<p>無論貨品人、均深信此等電訊、足以證明世界各國對於遠東之意見、雖各有不、而設法緩和其局勢之嚴重性、則屬一致、但此等電訊、亦足證明第二步未必即為東方之羅列根、日本將繼續因美國對英國之援助而杌隉不安、同時、日本又希望美國集中其注意於大西洋而忽視太平洋、以日本願見英國被擊敗、致美國無暇西顧、而一任日本稱霸太平洋、但事實上英國並未被擊敗、而美國對於太平洋亦未忽視、</p>
<p>日亦不欲從事戰爭</p>
<p>日本在此情形下、當然不致輕舉亡動、作孤注一擲、且英美荷三國亦無強迫日本作戰之意、由此觀之、遠東萬一發生戰事、為其戎首者、必為日本、但日本願意避免戰爭而以和平手段達到其目的、亦甚明顯、但日至少在目下尙不能達利用和平手段之目的、而此外亦無其他較佳之方法、同時吾人雖分身之術、但仍有多少時間可作自由之呼吸也、</p>
<h3>公共事業今日集會</h3>

<h3>法租界清潔工潮　昨已開始談判　商務工潮資方將謹愼處置　西法洗染業暫時停止營業</h3>
<p>法公董局清潔工人、自復工因扣除工資問題又重復實行罷工後、迄已多日、工潮仍在僵持中、惟法當局因該項工潮、長此僵持、殊屬非計、且夏令已屆、垃圾攸關衛生至鉅、故亟圖從速解決、茲聞警務處已派員出任調停、並聞昨日下午、局方與勞方曾一度商談、眾料是項工潮已趨和緩、如能接近、日內即可復工、</p>
<p>預防意外洗染停業</p>
<p>本市西去洗染業全體工人罷工風潮、自於本月四日發生以來、迄尙不獲解決、上海西法洗業同業公會為避免同業生意外事故起見、另於昨日上午派員發向各洗染店勸令暫時停止營業、以防萬一、一面並通知勞方須先行復業後、再開始談判、惟勞方現因感到罷工後一切苦痛、大致可予以接受、故在短期內即可復業、又本市北京路一〇六號密勒運輸公司全體司機工人、自於上月廿九日發生罷工以來、因雙方意見懸殊、故尙未能獲得解決勞資雙方現仍在僵持中、至何日始可獲得解決、一時尙難預卜、</p>
<p>商務勞資日夜磋商</p>
<p>商務印書館工潮、自上星期香港王總經理特派協　李伯嘉氏來滬後、迄今已達七日、勞資雙方曾兩度談判、卒因意見未接受、尙無結論、現更趨於沉悶、據聞李氏之來滬、本携有處置之辦法、復因到申後、鑒於勞方同人之態度、以致預定計劃遲遲未實行、不得不再與香港往返電洽、同時再與上海各負責者日夜磋商、得以解決一切梗阻、俾底於成、至於同人會方面消息、該會決始終一貫、顧全大局、力謀合理解決、並在資方不頒任何政策之前、會方仍力勸佈任同人安心在家、切勿輕舉妄動、現悉該會一切應採步驟、早經就緒、資方亦將謹愼處置、</p>

<h3>法租界公董局購米計劃完成　認銷港米單據催速塡報　米價或將有更大之跌風</h3>
<p>本市民食問題、自經工部局與港方協定成立、　米於十二日即可運滬出售後、一時嚴重空氣、為之大煞、一般平民亦均額手稱慶、惟投機米蠧及諸大囤戶、以事實實現有期、殊與本身利益有關、無不憂慮萬狀、冀在此港米尙未抵滬、米號家存底空虛之時、力持扳價、作最後之掙扎、但此不過曇花之一現、實乃最後回光反照之跡象也、茲分誌詳情如次、</p>
<p>催繳承銷港米單據</p>
<p>公共租界工部避總辦費利溥、於前日命令警務處各捕房、以認銷之單據、昨日各捕房已派捕至各米號收取是項單據、聞已有一部份米號業已塡就繳納、其餘尙未塡就之米號、亦正在趕塡中、屬於公共租界區域各米號、則繳與盧家灣捕房、一俟廉價港米抵滬後、即將按照實銷數目、分配承銷之合理各米號、以每石一百十元之法定價格、零售與市民、又據米業方面消息、米行及雜糧行至立基洋行訂購港米之數量、亦達五千包、其餘因資金關係、各小米行刻正進行合作訂購、</p>
<p>米蠧掙扎米價回平</p>
<p>昨日米市、因廉價港米即將到滬、故每石價格、繼續下跌四五元、後因一般囤戶之力扳、致價格略形回漲、但此僅係廉價港米抵滬後、囤戶之最後掙扎、蓋一般米蠧、明知維持高價、目下已不可能、惟猶圖乘此號家存底空虛、需要添購時、作最後扳價、但本市各住戶因廉米即將來滬、故除逐日零購暫維一家需要外、均停止購買目前高價之米糧、免得再受米蠧之剝削、</p>
<p>今日米價可望劇跌</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、消息靈通方面之華人稱、明晨（八日）或將有更大之跌風、其原因有二、　為工部局向香港承購洋米、同時法輪大達南號所承載之西貢米七萬袋、即可到滬、而有供過於求之勢、　同時法租界公董局、將於明日完成其向越南運米之計劃、其辦法與公共租界所採取者相同、第一批由越南運米之米、大槪將於今後兩星期內抵此、以後將有陸續運到也、</p>
<p>米商紛紛要求承銷</p>
<p>工部局向仰光訂購之米、約於十二日可抵滬、其數量據立基洋行職員稱、確為五千噸、抵滬後將分配各米號零售、因此該洋行每日所接電話甚忙、多數係零售米商要求承銷者、米業中人深信第一批洋米到滬後、不數日即可銷售一空、蓋因普通居民現均停止購米、正靜待工部局所訂購之洋米抵滬也、</p>
<p>分配問題已有決定</p>
<p>又訊、法租界當局、對行將由西貢運滬洋米之分配問題、已有決定、聞兩租界當局及法租界米商代表間、連日均有接洽、聞法租界之洋米、其售價與分配辦法、均係參照公共租界辦法實施、</p>
<h3>滬溫電報已通　滬甬交通可由青浦轉達</h3>
<p>溫州克復後、旅滬浙籍人士、對該處之戰後情形、咸寄關切、昨據新聲社記者探悉、本埠溫幫各商行、昨日已有接得永嘉電報局直接發米來上海之電報、雖未述及戰後情形、但已證實滬溫間昨日起已可</p>
<p>正式通報　溫州旅滬同鄉會得悉後、當於昨日午後去電永嘉、因電訊擁擠、迄晚尙未接得覆電、並悉昨日有由溫州來滬之旅客一人、彼係於上月下旬溫州淪陷後離永嘉而轉道抵滬者、據該旅客談稱、此次日軍進攻溫州、在玉環附近一帶與華軍</p>
<p>激戰最力　故玉環與溫州間之各鄉鎭、大都均遭戰事損失甚鉅、永嘉城區、則受捐較小、各機關團體及富有之家、均早經遷移、故亦遭鉅損、惟一般地方莠民、因迫於生計、</p>
<p>乘機搶刧　永嘉各大商店、幾無一不遭波及、尤以國　公司為最甚、所有存貨、完全被刦一空、其餘如松門各貨物堆棧等、亦遭搶刦、聞當局現正撫輯流亡、辦理善後事宜、浙東沿海各地、自發生戰事以來、滬浙間</p>
<p>水上交通　完全陷於停頓、昨據大光社記者向本埠交通界探悉、慈北淞浦、已有帆船往來松江縣屬之青浦鎭、故上海與寗波交通、已可間道抵滬、此外餘姚之庵東與張家沙、亦有船行駛、惟祇單身旅客可以往返、不宜携带行李貨物、惟查獲寗波自淪陷後、迄今尙未脫離戰事狀態、華方部隊時予出擊、故一切交通均未恢復、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、本埠字林西報因登載慈善獎券廣告、被美敎士賴金博士、向英領署告發、今日（七日）由英領署小公堂訊問完畢、判處字林報館罰金三十先令、審問官海尼斯於宣讀判決書時稱、根據英國法律、該報違反賭博及彩票法令、此項獎券、雖為救濟難民而非貿利性質、但亦不能例外、渠又稱、被告雖稱此項獎券之發售、曾經重慶中國政府及英法兩租界當局之核准、但被告律師瓊斯不能證明英國之賭博及彩票法令不適用於中國、此間英籍人民因享有領事裁判權之關係、均須受英國法律之管轄云、當時被告律師瓊斯向庭上聲明、不服原判、將向英領署正式法庭提起上訴、</p>

<h3>昨晨馬浪路大火　燬織綢廠六家　計焚屋八幢死九人傷二救火員　起因於工人煮食及自流井閉水</h3>
<p>昨晨五時許、法租界康悌路馬浪路六三五弄　榮華　、發生火警、燬屋八幢、多屬小型織綢廠、焚死男女九人、並傷二救火員、損失在十萬以上、華光社記者適居住該里、見聞較切、特將詳情分誌如後、</p>
<p>綢廠毘連</p>
<p>榮華里計有市房及住房一百二十一家、自一二八後、其中頗多改設小型織綢工廠、佈置大都因陋就簡、本年一月份、該里一弄內七十一及七十二兩號內某裯廠、已不慎於火、迄猶堆成瓦礫、四弄中十一號至十七號、昆連之七幢房屋、均係織綢廠、十一號至十三號　幢、廠主名葛明階、將十一十二兩幢之廠基生財、出租與其姪葛世奇經營奇成綢廠、十三號則另租與李某經營協盛綢廠、十四號係沈則劬開設之裕懋綢廠、十五十六號廠主胡文龍、亦出租與亞美綢廠、十七號則爲裕華綢廠、</p>
<p>起火情形</p>
<p>以上各廠、自節電後、或停　工、或至半夜、惟十三號李家之協盛廠、恰於前晚第一夜開全夜工、照例在淸晨六點鐘換班、由日工接替、其中工友在四點三刻因腹飢、即就　隙置行灶、以竹木雜料煮食冷飯、而火燄燒及與十四號隔界之薄木版壁後十四號機梢、絲綿着火、即延及扶梯下之絲頭紗頭、頓時火勢直竄、冒穿屋頂、不可遏止、其時風向又忽東忽四、致延燒及西端十號（十號係住家姓尹）、至東端十七號爲止、當火勢未盛前、左右隣欲先灌救、又値該里自　井水、房主藉詞節省、每天下午十點起、至翌晨七時之問、將自流井總龍頭關閉、無水可用、雖經呼喊管水伕從睡夢中驚醒、打足馬達、至六點鐘始得通水、致米能及早撲救、</p>
<p>焚死九人</p>
<p>其時因天方黎明、留廠員役工人、猶未起身、驚醒稍遲者、即不及逃避、十二號之廠主葛世奇、因其妻周氏在內、聞警　、即由其庽所（亦在該里）率同妾趙氏·小孩民忠·女鳳英·奔赴廠內、不料全家五人、均葬送火窟、十三號則死廠主李某之妻及女工二人（張寶央呂氏、）男工一人、共有九名之多、</p>
<p>傷救火員</p>
<p>法租界救火會方面聞訊後、即全體出動、五時十五分許、即陸續驅救火車到塲、竭力灌救、奈因細雨迷濛、風勢不定、歷二小時半始行灌熄、並有嵩山路救火會第二十五號救火員受壓傷甚重、嗣即送廣慈醫院醫治、</p>
<p>損失奇重</p>
<p>據云此次火災、損失　重、聞五家綢廠之生財原料、價値已在十萬元以上、雖各保有火險、但共總數不及損失之半、且救火時、馬浪路上所停救火車、連同捕房救護車及公事車、不下數十輛之多、致該路原有商店及小菜塲、均因此停市、無法營業、此尤意外之損失、</p>
<h3>報關行老司務　私竊棧車　冒提布疋廿件</h3>
<p>寗波路三百廿七弄二號謙祥益布號申莊係魯省巨富　尤居孟所開設、而由劉子聲者任經理、最近該號有布疋五十件、每件計四十疋、委託法租界天主堂街七十八號同發公報關行代存於寗波路英商平治明第七堆棧、當時由該堆棧給付棧單一紙、及支貨簿一本、以後謙祥益如須提貨、僅須　具支貨單一紙、書明貨物多寡、加蓋圖章、該棧即憑單照付、乃謙祥益茲發覺是項支貨單少去一頁、乃向平治明調查、方悉存貨巳爲人冒領去二十件、價値約二萬另八百元、遂報告老閘捕房、由華探曹岐山予以調查、認定同發公老司務甬人胡貴賓涉有重大嫌疑、因胡與謙祥益極熟、故得出入賬房間、毫無阻礙、乃將其拘捕、昨晨解送特一法院刑一庭、捕房律師汝葆彝聲請准予顯押、以便詳細偵查、經馮庭長質訊之下、諭令押候改期再訊、</p>

<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>糧食　米商存心如虎似狼　米價所以跌而復漲　以猜忌之心理猶在作暗中之破壞　殊不知工部局已定政策決難動搖</h3>
<p>洋米昨日初跌　漲、市面雖似轉入盤旋局勢、然以連朝大跌特跌、已比最高價格小去二十三五元、跌後引起本客實銷及散戶之趁平收買、而執貨者仍不肯出脫、猶在盡力掙扎、以致有此大跌小回之象、若以存到之夥、港米平售即將實現、越米繼起來申、客銷停頓、本化有限、市面納入正軌之後、則如此高價當然不能久站、即使米商掙扎支撑、亦未必能持久、故未來米價尚有續跌之必要、</p>
<p>米商心理依然如虎似狼、此昨市米價所以跌而復漲、蓋米商存有三種心理、</p>
<p>其一以爲工部局定米出售、只以此次五萬包爲限、其後不將繼續、故以工部局此舉爲壓平目前米價之「空氣作用」、因之欲待其所「猜忌之心理」果獲證實、則米價不特一百六十元、竞可一竄再竄、竄至兩百元以、上至是米蠢囤戶又可爲所欲爲矣、查米商此種心理之由來、大約有鑒於工部局歷次所定限價、均被米商各個擊破、且頻頻越限而上、工部局固無如之何、遂以爲工部局此後按月運銷大宗港米、以應上海全市民食、非但以爲不能待久、亦且以爲不可能、米商喜造謠放空氣、遂亦以小人之心、度君子之腹、而以工部局運港米應滬上民食、亦含有一種空氣作用之因素在內、殊不知工部局在公共租界以內爲市政當局、市政當局之一舉一動、必有其已定政策爲根據、決不至如以前限價、誤認米蠢囤戶爲「正當業米」之輩不加干涉、遂使數百萬市民有絕食之虞、今旣幡然改圖與港政府合作、以救濟滬上民食、決不至虛聲恫人、以首批之五萬包爲止、亦不以米商消極抵抗、而變更辦米平售之政策、若果如米商所逆億、則將何以見信於上海數百萬之民衆、故米商此種心理、徒見其爲貪很惡辣、只顧一己發大財置數百萬生存於絕地、並有藐視及破壞工部局政令之惡意存於其中、</p>
<p>其二、在米商心理、以爲日本必圖南進、一旦南進、香港地位必搖動、則港滬縱有濟糧之約、事實上不能履行、則今日所囤之米、將粒粒珍同珠寶、屆時必無正價、可任米商魚肉、莫敢誰何、以上二者、皆爲昨日米價跌而復漲之謠諑大原因、</p>
<p>其三、米商對外揚言、以爲如經銷工部局之米、則彼手中所積存高價之米、如何出銷、此其言未嘗不動聽、其實正是絕對相反、查現在上海存米兩百萬包左右、其成本每包最高不過百元有零、故在米商抬至最高時、每包所賺不下七十、六十、至少亦有四五十元、利益之鉅、無論何種生意、均所不及、「亘古罕聞、曠世未見」、爲上海最近米市之謂、即最近雖連跌三日（昨後市又見回漲）而米商每包之盈利、至少猶在三、四、五十元之間、利益仍是優厚、即使將來米價與工部局所定米價走平、米商尚無虧蝕之理、或謂近來所定之米、其價已高、實則所定有限、即使價高、皆爲米商將本地米價抬得太高、遂使洋商見獵心喜、亦將定價抬高、此亦米商自己造成之惡果、與大衆何尤、工部局無涉、</p>
<p>總之、米商要尊重工部局之地位、及其意思、何况今日工部局正欲將數白萬民衆從囤戶米蠹之虎狼口吻中救出、且工部局既已有此一舉、決無中道而廢之理、即任何事故、亦必早在工部局深慮遠謀之中、非若米商只顧殺人、不知爲兒孫造福、亦不知爲自己稍留後步、至今猶不覺悟、還在夢想顚倒、怙惡不悛、此輩奸商、豈尚自知爲人類、不然、何以殘賊同類至於此極、</p>
<p>昨早市關盤後承前日賣風之濃厚、各洋米再跌二三五元、尤以小紋跌風最猛小至一百二十五元、混合碎米至一百零五元爲最、其他各米無大一致跟小、即英華司原包現小絞開一百五十六元、四五月期祇一百五十三四元、一號西貢一百五十九元、碎米一百二十二元半至百二十三元、均比前日小二三元、繼以囤戶心懷不良、故意散佈有利買方謠言、市價回好二三元、動擼對於工部局之信心、然漲後有大批出籠、收市仍回小一二元、全日成交現米八千包、原包一千噸計一號西貢爲百三十八元至百三十六元、敏黨白三十元百二十八元、小絞百三十元百二十九元、碎尖百零六七元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳　國米、銷塲依然不暢、且　主顧惜、又在擯持、故結果祇有早晚稻做開三五十石、價爲百卅六七元、較之前日計落五六元、厚粳仍乏成交、至於糯米去路旣稀、而又備受他貨之牽制、遂亦再難維持、開出香港白元祇百二十五六元、糯菉百十六七元、計暴落六七元之巨、統計成交數又屬寥落無幾、</p>
<p>洋米續有到埠、法公司達得南號郵船、昨午抵滬由西貢運來洋米一千三百五十包、另有大批苞米計五萬八千包之多、亦自西貢裝來、停靠虹口順泰碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>粉市仍疲</h3>
<p>麵粉　現洋粉市况、上午開盤、仍受洋米猛跌影響、人心萎靡不振、金龍牌坎粉價由三十二元四五角、降至三十二元、始引起本客實銷幫之問津、成交約有六千餘包、價三十二元二三角、花烏牌澳粉價三十三元、毫無受主、惟　市形勢較穩、因米價跌風漸息、更傳運滬澳粉中途折回、今後來源未必湧旺、故市面或有回甦之象、華廠平價粉、仍由福新廠供給五千餘包、及抽出洋粉併計八千三百十八包、價仍爲二十九元、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况亦已暗鬆、蓋緣運日粉價步落、人心不振、各粉廠對原料久未正式收取、日廠鬥市收貨亦屬無形停頓、聞租界本棧存麥價爲四十七八元、暫無受主、故市面沉寂如常、</p>
<h3>雜糧　苞米猛瀉午後重振</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧油餅上半日全在疲軟聲中、乃囚米價有跌無漲、人心虛怯、搶帽子絕踪、市氣一意下游、計生油平定外、豆油跌二元、黃豆挫落四五角、苞米猛瀉二元左右、豆餅　落五六角、成交寥寥、至午後米市被謠言推動、復告緊張、豆餅苞米在一貫做作之下、即見回光反照、計苞米比上午市漲起一元五六角、做開西貢新苞米價爲三十五元至三十六元五角、陳貨爲三十三元五角至三十四元七角、訂四月份交爲六十八元、荷蘭白苞米爲三十四元六角至三十六元、現貨英華司爲六十六元六十五元五角、訂四五月份交爲六十六元零五分、又黃苞米價爲三十四元六角、現貨英　司爲六十八元、豆餅祗開甡記期貨、行情由跌翻漲、且比上日市漲起二角、計訂五月上交價爲二十一元一角至一元八角、五月下交爲二十一元四角至二十二元二角、六月上交爲二十二元五角至二十三元零五分、</p>
<p>雜糧油麻八日出口、運新加坡豆子一千一百四十五包、運香港芝蔴一百包、蔴油二百聽、巡新加坡高粱子一百五十包、</p>
<h3>金融　港方結進外滙</h3>
<p>外滙作日市况、滙豐掛牌、各滙　更、英美滙暗市先鬆伐突回平、乃香港來電少塞後、忽來猛扒十萬美元、更聞有巨額洋米結款、故美·日行售出硬至美金五元二五可結、投機家供意中輟、終見回平至五元二一八七五、英滙亦硬至三辦士二五、即回平、終爲三辦士二三四三七五、均與上日收價同、交易頗旺達、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>自晨外電銀市英·美·印一致未更、各國滙兌美對滬長四分、英對滬長〇　一二五、餘平、內盤早開銀行賣價、現貨英滙三辦士二　四　七五、美金五元二一八七五、日商正金等行力塞予麥加利有利現美金五元二五、華商與港電亦塞五六月價亦五元二五、至九點二十分某行竟照上價肯售出、英滙亦鬆至三辦士二五可結、滙豐掛牌各滙未更、白銀平衡稅仍微百分之二四·一五〇後、不意港電忽來力扒五六月美金十萬元、價五元二五、聞洋行有洋米結款、金價又見步漲、進口商力扒五六月價五元二五及五元二一八七五、投機家止賣、近午轉趨軟化、午收現貨至六月期、均　滙三辦士二三四三七五、美金五元二一八七五、均與上日收價相同、</p>
<p>香港七日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、英滙日滙仍無變動、美滙期貨鬆〇六二五、爲二十四元二五、（昨收爲二十四元一八七五）、申滙現貨降二元、爲四百六十二元、（昨收爲四百六十四元）、下午週三無市、</p>

<h3>金市欲跌又止</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、先跌後突又轉漲、各方人心業已轉趨向榮、乃美匯上檔所看五元二五已到、在進口商米洋行及港電轉扒、由鬆回平、故晨開後退至六千六百十七元、不久證券幫金號匯票商着手補空、更聞滬西幫售現紗前來套進與補空、故於午刻上升更銳、哄達六千六百五十七元高價、終見回升九元、半日交易共約二萬兩、下午週三無市、塲外價甚平、現金萬豐售予祥和五十兩、價照期交高一百〇五元、成記出順源與德孚各一百兩、高一百十元、永成出祥和一百兩、高一百十五元、明豐出德孚五十兩、高一百廿元、軋升約廿元、飾金關金等均平、</p>
<p>晨九點十五分開市、六千六百三十元、比上日收價低一元、俄又抬上至六千六百四十元、聞美金五元二五可結、仁承永·鑫源·成記·誠達·新豐永來力售、頓見步降廿三元、退至六千六百十七元、爲大豐·德大·順源·德字收吸、價盤於六千六百卅元左右、起落轉狹、距至十一點十五分、外匯報緊、益大·仁承永亦來復進、散空抵補、上升突銳、哄至六千六百五十七元、誠達·大豐來售、退至六千六白四十八元、正午收市六千六百五十元、比前日晚收價回升九元、應五月美金午收五元二一八七五結價、爲六千六百七十三元、計撳廿三元、半日有四十元上落、下午週三塲外價平、仍六千六百五十元有賣戶、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高一百四十元、收進比售出低六十元、現標金仍無價無市</p>
<h3>證劵　內債絕少精彩</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况、又復趨於非常沉悶之途、前日稍有轉機、仍因大戶無力拉抬、而反有出脫而冉趨於盤旋帶疲醞釀之中、時局無甚變化、而做多者因市價之疲軟無力、爲期已久、所負利息則已甚鉅、故稍稍上漲、即遭挫折、檯面之無精神而閒散、當以昨日午後一盤爲甚、上午因協興元及鴻十買進、丙種曾好起二角、入後九成及同康多頭稍稍放出、乃又回軟、午後市况交易極度淸减、乙種竞未能開出、其餘各種亦不過一二行市點緣而已、市價復見稍疲、形勢爲多方稍一抬高一二角即有賣戶、幸賣方尚不急於求售、否則早已跌小甚鉅、結果丙戊兩種彼漲此跌、爲數祇五分、其餘三種完全　見上落、成交數全日祇四五十萬元而已、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>股衆交易、成交恒利銀行設八十八股、價爲六元八角五分、每股票面祇十元、</p>
<h3>紗花　多空觀念懸殊　紗市起伏不定</h3>
<p>紗市由低轉高、但趨勢仍有飄忽靡常之勢、此因多空兩方皆有意志、觀念相差殊遠、買方謂雙馬棧單乾涸、照肚看漲、至於賣方爲雜脾紗太廉、與雙馬之距離殊堪驚人、所以一般投機的人們、時進時出、熱鬧非凡、客幫方面、實銷仍之躉批採辦、不過零星交易、賡續而不斷也、二十支雙馬高價一千五百六十二元、低價　千五百四十四元、午後初做一千五百六十五元、跌至一千五百六十三元、又五至一千五百六十四五元、最後價爲一千五百六十一二元、今日有棉紗六百七十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、趨勢尚緊、因海外美棉續堅、所以有一部份投機者活躍、首盤價爲一千五百五十三元、此盤一開、買者紛紛、一霎間升至一千五百五十九元、惟證券幫一致繼續巨量的賣出、同時金價開出仍鬆、少頃回落至一千五百四十四元、此時有一批多頭活動拖進加碼、回復至一千五百五十元外、然樓上之四　支綫價向下、某所標準不振、於是壓力米鬆、在五十元邊口迴旋殊久、此後多方謠言又起、調廠方收進棧單三百包、同時標金轉昂、一時塲內閧聲大振、絡續漲至一千五百六十二元、收盤價爲一千五百六十一元、查半日間成交统計一萬〇七百九十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港七九〇　同行一〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>統計一〇、七九〇</p>
<h3>美棉一再高漲　細絨交易熱鬧</h3>
<p>現棉情况、略形轉佳、雖廠方需要不暢、而人心已好轉、惟交易大多係細絨原料、故價較前升四五元、粗絨交易、仍寥寥如昔、價漲一二元、昨共成一千四百四十六件、</p>
<p>大中集　三一三　新裕三〇〇件送廠</p>
<p>美彭家坡三一〇　又　一〇〇件又</p>
<p>巴西花　四〇〇　順豐一二六件棧交</p>

<p>蘭貢花　二一四盛和　一〇〇件又</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、雖因美棉一再高漲、而人心興奮、但基於紗市平庸、同時本市存底尚多、而廠方納胃欠暢、昨日同業購稍形熱鬧、市價較之上日亦漲一二元左右也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　大宗廠布　運銷新加坡暹羅</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨跌午回、趨勢轉穩、售盤白貨晨跌每疋　角半至五角、午後一部份回漲（每疋）二角半、結果仍較上日軋跌一角至二角半、漂染布亦挫落每疋　角半之譜、本街成交坯布·漂染布·粗布·斜紋四百餘件、浙閩幫辦色斜·粗細布·府綢一百餘件、粵港幫辦元布、士林布等二百數十件、新加坡暹羅幫辦華豐士林布、漂布香港布卡其等六千餘疋、</p>

<h3>怎樣擇書　（四）</h3>
<p>— 周良生</p>
<p>三、關於情趣的陶冶人們的生活除知識意志之外、感情也很重要、例如我們讀書、我們不能常常的讀那修養的書、刻意去求做人的道理、應事接物的方法、也不能死板板地只讀着科學一類的書、刻意從事知能的增進、有時應該閱護詩歌小說之類、使我們在情趣上能够得到一些陶冶、這類的書、它的感動人的力量、比較修養品格增進知能的書來得大、所以選諫這類的書、要有適當的標準、如果錯一着、非但徒勞精神、空費時間、並且妨害身心、影饗着實不小、</p>
<p>（一）內容正當的　選擇關於陶冶情趣一類的書、必須注意它的內容正當不正當、因爲適合我們趣味的書、不是全是有益的、這好比毒藥外面裹起糖衣、我們嘴裏起初很甜、過後却會壞了腸臟的、</p>
<p>（二）描寫深刻的　選鐸陶冶情趣的書、固然應該注意它的內容正當不正當、可是還須注意它的描寫方面是否深刻、書的內容、有深刻的描寫、我們讀了、才能引起我們的情趣、</p>
<p>（三）含義深長的　字裏行間、含義深長、可以發人猛省的、近人寫作的幽默小品、不但文宇藝術化、並且意在言外、含蓄不盡、我們體味它的眞理的所在、很能陶冶我們的情趣、</p>
<p>四、關於思想的訓練　人類不能不求知、求知除了讀書却還有更重要的事情、可是求知就得着　思想的訓練、思想訓練、並不一定只依靠讀書、然而常常閱讀訓練思想的書、却可給我們思想訓練上很大的幫助、我們對於訓練思想的書、要用甚麼標準去選擇呢、</p>
<p>（一）能够啟發思想的　一般的書、都可以啟發我們的思想、不過我們的思想、要有分析或綜合的能力、那麼應該在一般的書籍中、要擇比較能够激發我們的思緒的、</p>
<p>（二）能够解決問題的　訓練我們思想的書、除注意激發我們思緒　外、在選擇的時候、還須注意這書或那書是不是可以解決問題的、因爲解決問題的書、　樣能够訓練我們的思想、</p>
<p>（三）考　實騐的　選擇訓練思想的書、又須注意它是否能够考證實　的、常常選讀考證實驗的書、我們的思想也就會科學化起來的、西人爲發明一個理論、不惜犧牲畢生的力量以求證據、必定待到數十百千的證據都相同了、然後才敢自信、有些　呢、它的理論有　不很正確、我們讀了、會使我們的思想走到歧途上去的、所以我們選擇訓練思想一類的晝、須得特別注意這一點才是、（完）</p>

<h3>奬勵生育</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>近年來幾個極權國家，「獎勵生育」，可說「不遺餘力」。</p>
<p>他們對於「人口稠密」的大家庭，頒給獎狀，對於無力結婚的靑年，賜予借款，對於「男大不婚」的獨身主義者，課罰重稅，也可說是盡其威迫利誘的能事了。可是他們的目的小過是在製造吏多的候補砲灰而已。</p>
<p>對於「生育」是否需要「獎勵」，有一位美國記者表示懷疑。</p>
<p>他說，美國政府並沒有獎勵生育，可是父母並沒因政府不獎勵就停止生育，人口的數目也並不因此而减少，根據一九三〇年至一九四〇年間美國全國的人口調查統計，一九四〇年美國孩的「產量」，是超過其他任何一年的。</p>
<p>他以爲與其用威迫利誘的手段去獎勵生育，不如給民衆一個人道的政府。讓民衆有生活的自由，讓民衆安居樂業，鮮憂寡慮，豐衣足食，下作不必要的侵略戰爭的恐怖；這樣一來，政府是不必怕民衆會停止生育的。在這樣的政府統治之下，生育是不需要獎勵的。</p>
<p>這些話是値得玩味的。</p>
<p>兒童</p>
<h3>倫敦兒童的厄運</h3>
<p>— 溫和</p>
<p>倫敦的大轟炸，設來令人咋舌，然而倫敦兒童所遭受的厄運，還不止炸彈一項。</p>
<p>倫敦的强迫敎育制度，差不多已告停頓。小學校因轟炸損壞或因國家徴作別用而閉歇的，佔全市總數的一半。照舊上課的還有三百六十五所學校，然而授課時間已經减少，空襲警報一響，敎員只得宣佈下課。</p>
<p>還有一件嚴　的現象，就是逃學人數的增加。倫敦五歲到十四歲的學齡兒童，的有八萬人，然而現在每天到校上課的，不過二萬六千人。官方雖然派人到學生家中去催逼上課，效果還是很小。許多家長都因爲顧全子女的安全問題，不敢讓他們出去上課。事實上，有些兒童却是由於父母的差遣，到街上去做小販生意或是求乞去了。有些別的兒童根本是在外面胡鬧。</p>
<p>家長不讓子女上學，還有一個原因，就是防空洞的榻位，需要有人照料看守，才不致臨時忽忙。每天早晨九時，孩子們拿了被褥到地下車站去，爲一家大小尋覓妥適的榻位，覓得後，就在地下看守。有一個孩子說道：「上學嗎？我要看位子呢，是不是？媽媽回家去，有事做，她叫我來巷她看位子。」</p>
<p>地下空氣混濁，光綫溫暖都不充份，厠所又少，常在地下生活，健康就成問題。醫生護十雖然常去視察，但是人數總不够分配。有一個醫生，白天在一所兒童醫院裹服務，夜裏他還要到防空洞去，那邊有五千個男女老幼，都要他一人照顧。</p>
<p>政府竭力敦促人民把兒童遷出倫敦，報上長篇大論登出來，一面還印發傳單，另外派六百個人員，挨戶訪問，勸家長把兒童都遷移別處。他們雖然說得脣焦舌敝，民衆却大多不加理會，大多數的兒童還是沒有遷移出去。所以後來敎育局局長蘭絲白生說道：「强迫遷移學齡兒童，無論在政治上或是社會上都是辦不到的。」</p>

<h3>有理由不怕太叔婆</h3>
<p>— 石</p>
<p>在五月一日的本談裏，登着肅草君的「媳婦難做」，不覺起了如下的感想：</p>
<p>肅草君把私立學校比作大家庭；校長，家長，敎員，同事，介紹人，學生……比作婆太太，太婆，太公，媳婦，妯娌，小姑，丈夫，孩子，……似乎也能反映一部份的現實；同時，他所受的痛苦，確也使我十分同情。不過我認爲在這種環境下充當敎師，雖　感到困難，却並不是絕對的無辦法。俗語說：「有理不怕太叔婆」，可見只要自己能根據敎育原理，兒童心理，盡心竭力，實施敎學，一切外來的麻煩，不愁不迎刃而解。即使退幾步說，如果能在不違反校長意旨之下，努力工作，使學生得到實益，非但校長會對你另眼相看，就是家長也會對你發生好感。（因爲校長之要校譽好；家長之要子弟進步，都是必然的事情。）如果能做到這點，那麽一般妯娌，小姑，同事，雖欲生事，亦無從下手；介紹人，丈夫，雖然沒權，也沒有什麼關係了。須知學校究非家庭，敎師究非媳婦，一個媳婦尚能「有理不怕太叔婆」，何况自己是個領導人羣，負改風易俗責任的敎師呢！</p>
<p>這是在下一些淺薄的傻見，質諸高明，以爲何如？</p>
<h3>予囤積者以打擊</h3>
<p>— 起帆作</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>石頭充饑</h3>
<p>— 今純</p>
<p>美國甘州的科學家，新近發明一種經濟實惠的飼畜方法，就是用石灰石的粉末，代替以前用的草料。一班農民都競起採用，因爲非但成本低微，可以獲利較厚，而用這種「食料」飼後的牛，據說要比平常用草料的更來得碩壯。原來動物的食料中都需要有相當的鈣質，而石灰石粉鈣質量之豐富，據科學家新近實騐結果，知並不遜於普通的草料。</p>
<p>科學家試用石灰石粉時，先是因爲甘州地方瘦瘠，草料缺乏，以爲鈣質補身體，於是用其他物質與石灰石粉參和和飼牛，後來見單用石灰石粉也極好，於是遂專用石灰石粉了。現在試騐結果，知道一磅這種石灰石粉可以供一頭牛食十天。從前用四塊錢的草料，現在以代石灰石粉，祇須兩角錢。</p>
<p>甘州科學家現在除了研究新的牛的食料以外，現在更在研究將草製成食品供人喫，據說這種食品內的維他命含量特別豐富云。</p>
<p>像這類的發明也並不是祗限於美國的一班科學家，聽說德國的科學家們正在製木頭的麵包，並且已經製成一種「肉」，完全是由木質提出來，喫當然可以喫，不過味道恐怕不能得十分高妙罷了。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（七）臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>可是他的視錢才和秋海棠的目光一碰上，却也禁不住機伶伶的打了一個寒戰；在這二十多歲的年輕人的眸子裏，已充滿着一種憤怒，怨毒，和拚命的情緒，使看見的人永遠不能忘記，就像我們從舊小說裏所看到的寃鬼一樣，它會在你心坎中種下一重恐怖，使你在幻覺上永遠看到這一對眸子。</p>
<p>門開了，外面走進一個人，但不是秋海棠所盼望的袁紹文，而是那個喪盡天良的季兆雄；手裏已握着一柄步槍上慣用的刺刀，一閃一閃地在發出耀眼的光來。</p>
<p>秋海棠知道是絕望了。</p>
<p>「啊！不要這樣啊　你們…！不要…！這樣對付我啊……！」他竭力吐出了嘴裏所堵着的東西，沒命價的喊着；不等季兆雄的刀子刺到他臉上來，他已經早失去知覺了。</p>
<p>當袁紹文累得滿頭大汗把胡督軍抱着一同趕來的時候，秋海棠的身子已直僵僵地躺在地下了，臉已染得像一顆血球一樣，左邊的一個眼睛也被刀尖劃破了，簡直絲毫不再像一張人的臉。</p>
<p>「這是誰幹的事？」　文抬起頭來，瞪同着一雙眼睛，向院子裏每一個人看了一下，頂上的頭髪幾乎就要堅起來了。</p>
<p>沒有人敢回答。</p>
<p>「這是誰幹的事？我要跟他拼命！」他一直站到袁寶的藩面前去，相距不到半尺，血紅的眼睛，直釘在老袁的臉上，他已經完全否認他是自己的叔父了。（一〇〇）</p>

<h3>獨輪救護架</h3>
<p>— 李義</p>
<p>救護隊所用之担架及昇牀，向以隊員兩名昇之，救受傷者一人，殊不經濟。爲彌補此種缺憾起見，最近有獨輪救護架出世，可以一人之力，救護傷者一人，且速度亦較昇架增加。其法乃在舁架之下，配一脚踏車所用之車輪，對於被炸區域之救護工作，增加便利不少。</p>

<h3>從言菊朋談話到失空斬</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>梨園老生一行，自叫天以譚調名世後。數十年來，無論直接間接，言其派，大抵以譚為依歸，不過有變有不變而已。變者如余，如馬，固然可以卓然成家；不變者如貫，如富英，亦能硜硜自守。至於言菊朋，則在變而不變之中，以視上述之有變有不變者，自亦可以稱譚派傳人者也。</p>
<p>菊朋年來出演各埠，共打泡戲輒以失空斬居多數，失空斬一劇，為老譚畢坐得意之作，身段手面，台步神情行腔使白無一處不合於當年武侯身分，時伶演來，不似張良劉基，便類謀客策士，蓋此劇無儒雅氣派者不能演，無莊嚴氣派者不能演，無蒼勁氣派對不能演，少此一者，雖唱自能悅耳動聽，做作能形象逼眞，其為模仿刻劃，終不能免。聞諸老顧曲家云：老譚演此，有幾處很不易學到的地方，例如：坐帳後傳馬謖叮嚀時所唱之西皮原板，一種諄諄囑咐讖慎從事之態；聽三報後之緊張神色，白口中「司馬懿大兵來得好快呀﹂，搖板中「我用兵數十年從來謹慎﹂等句，描摹由驚血悔，由海而恨，曲曲傳出，絕不板滯；慢板「我本是﹂一段之閒適氣槪，一唱三嘆，將武侯在用兵危急之秋，猶不忘當年先主敦聘之情，流露無遺。又如，二六一段，音佳而難唱，過緩則平，過急則俗，老譚於此，有「泰山崩於前而色不變﹂之象。更如斬謖時趨步陞帳，別有一種肅穆氣槪，一段快板，疾而不迫，怒而不怨，但覺滿腔悲憤，完全於「責打王平四十棍﹂一句中傳出，能令觀衆情緒，陸然為之緊張，尤共為不易學到者，近伶演此，都忽視此句，反於哭謖時矯柔造作求采，亦大謬也！夫菊朋於譚劇有深湛造詣，演此劇當亦能會心不遠，意者，儒雅蒼勁，或達此境？至欲控制劇情，度孜孜學譚數十年，倘不至如時伶之僅得皮相也乎</p>

<p>王引袁美雲集贅自攝之處女作「同命鴛鴦」，業已決定下月初旬假國聯新華攝影場開拍，並將邀諸章志直尤光照等客串演出，聞劇本係出自王引手筆，情節頗為緊湊，聞預計攝製費為四萬五千元。</p>
<p>金燄近應重慶中國電影製片廠之電邀，於月內將挈同王人美重行搭機返渝。聞中電廠已決定請其夫婦分別主演「出征曲」「新長恨歌」兩片。該兩片導演已內定程步高及袁宗榴，後者並有顧而己助導。</p>
<p>傳陳雲裳李綺年等將於最近期內返港一次，但因滬地公司合同關係，決不在港再行攝片，故預計在一個月內即可分別返滬工作。</p>
<p>中國放行劇團已與卡爾登戲院訂立日場長期合同，以後如言菊朋輟演後若周信芳亦無意出演，則將續訂夜場合同，聞目前日場租金較之蘭心大戲院可低三倍餘，故唐槐秋日內已安心積極排練新劇本三部，將繼「洪宣嬌」後陸續演出。</p>
<p>藍靑加入綠寶劇場後，因國語純熟，表情優美，故頗受多數觀衆擁戴，玆悉綠寶當局為獎勵優秀人才起見，於下月一日決自軌增加藍靑酬勞一百元。</p>
<p>金星新片「孤島春秋」已攝製過半，據聞今劇情節盡係諷刺目前孤烏上之一般桃色靑年，預計該片在下月底即可攝竣，並聞該片首映全已屬於「金都」。</p>
<p>「風　寡婦」在滬光賣座奇佳，故導演李萍倩近日頗為得意，並據李氏表示，擬仍以該片之一貫作風，續請李綺年主演一片，已部份將仍以原班人馬協助演出，編劇一職，將仍由葉逸芳擔任。</p>
<p>上海劇藝社繼「家」後之作品，已選定為「爭强」一劇，旋因少數人員發生爭執，乃不得已暫時宣吿輟演，現已定於九日起先行公演「鴛鴦刦」「白取樂」兩劇，聞戲該兩劇後演出之劇本，計有「撒謊世界」一正氣歌」「愛仇之間」　劇。</p>
<p>最近來重慶游歷考察的美國新　作家漢明威，他的著作要被派拉蒙公司搬上銀慕了，曾描寫西班牙內戰的力作「為誰歌唱」（For　Whom　the　Bell　Tells）已請定伊　麗褒曼擔任，選是瑞典女伶，男主角大約係賈萊占柏比較有希望。</p>

<p>第八章落花有意隨流水</p>
<p>曲曲折折走至一個小軒裏，早見何姬亭亭玉立，含笑相迎。許靖連忙行禮。何姬請他坐下，小婢獻上香茗。許靖雖然坐着，心裏却侷促不安。何姬談笑自若，美目流盼，向許靖問詢　縣風俗狀况。許靖敬謹回答。何姬時時把秋波送過來，且向他作淺笑。許靖覺得伊的眼波裏有熱情流露出來，又如有魔力蕩人心魂，自己極力鎮定着，不敢作劉楨之平視。何姬見了他這種拘謹態度，暗暗好笑。又問他司曾有室家之好？許靖只得說道：「匈奴未滅，何以家為？只因自己想到外邊幹些功名事業，所以尚未論娶。」何姬笑道：「我聞男子生，而願為才有室，公子的年紀止可娶一位如花如玉的小姐，享受些溫柔艷福，怎麼還沒有抱衾與裯的床頭人呢？待我來作個月老可好？」說罷，格格地笑出聲來。許靖聽了這話却不便回答，正襟危坐，以目視鼻。何姬又道：「公子在這裏可嫌寂寞嗎？你常常進來談談也好，這裏是沒有外人的。老頭兒學了佛，脾氣古怪得很，日間不常過來，恐怕他要去做和尚哩。」許靖聽何姬背地裏稱主永泰為老頭兒，心裏便覺有些不愉快，遂立起身來說道：「小姪外邊尚有他事，吿辭了。何姬道：「公子且坐一會兒，何必就走？」許靖道：「既然無甚吩咐我也不多坐了。」於是回身走出軒去，只聽何姬還在那裏嬌笑；也許笑許蜻有些傻氣呢。許靖還到房中，把赤鳳劍懸在壁上，坐着想想何姬方纔的態度，很欠大方，雖則其人其玉，而仔細看來，終究有些小家碧玉，婢學夫人的模樣王永泰年紀已老，娶了這種佻　的年輕婦女為小星，恐非閨房之福。他是宅心光明，待人非常和善，沒有什麼歹心腸去猜疑人家的，但像這種人却不可不防啊。然而這事又怎樣能向他老人家直道呢？心裏不覺有些煩悶。自從這天起，許靖便又格外注意到何姬的表弟桑一淸了，因他常見桑一淸跑到內室去；有幾次王永泰外出後，桑一淸徬晚時從內室慌慌張張的走出來，恰逢許靖在庭中散步。桑一淸瞧見了他，便悄悄地踅中別處去了，許靖不能無疑。（五七）</p>

<p>「鴛鴦刦」這個名字觀衆也許很熟吧！大家可記得三月裏國泰　戲院開演費雯麗和勞倫斯奧立佛主演的「鴛鴦刦」。是一個文藝性的大悲劇，甚得觀衆們的贊美和好評。現在上海劇藝社的「鴛鴦刦」也就是電影上的一樣故事。此劇原是英國名劇作家約翰高爾期華綏的舞台劇，美國影片公司把它改攝電影，假使我們在舞台上看到此劇，其原有的風格和韻味一定比電影還要來得動人。</p>
<p>導演是吳仭之，演員為柏李，胡導等三人，分飾劇中的一對靑年男女—溫達和賴立。由石揮扮演法官岐司，全劇演出非常緊張，男女雙變殉愛。比電影上勉强使之團圓還要有力得多。</p>
<p>「鴛鴦刦」上演時，還　演一個獨幕劇—「自取樂」。佐臨導演。由英子，史原，韓非三人演出。恰巧和「鴛鴦刦」相反，是一個引人大笑的鬧劇。演期祇有四天—九日到十二日。該社鄭車排練的夏衍名著一愁最記」即將繼之公演。</p>

<h3>Stimson Appeals to the Nation: Use the Navy to Escort Munitions; America Must Spare No Sacrifice to Protect Freedom; Britain's Control of the Atlantic is Related to American Security</h3>
<p>Washington—Secretary of War Stimson, in a broadcast address to the nation last night, advocated the immediate use of the American Navy to ensure the safe passage of munitions across the ocean to Britain. At the outset of his speech, Stimson responded to those who called him a warmonger and opposed America's current defense efforts, saying, "For many years after the World War, as a citizen and Secretary of State, I devoted myself to establishing the rule of law among nations, so that disputes between nations could be resolved through judicial means instead of force. This movement once seemed very promising, but that time has now passed, and our hopes for peace have been shattered by international aggression. The world now faces a great crisis, and all our efforts must be turned to defending our own security. Therefore, I speak frankly tonight about this crisis and the defenses we should take. In 1933, a group led by Hitler seized power in Germany and overthrew the German Republic. These people, both within and outside Germany, have turned back time by more than five centuries, and are implementing their publicly declared plan to conquer the entire world. To achieve this goal, they have secretly built a vast military apparatus based on forced labor. They have already occupied Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, and have enslaved the people of these thirteen countries under Nazi tyranny. Two other countries with military ambitions have attached themselves to the Axis like vassals: Italy and Japan. Italy's crimes include the unprovoked attacks on Abyssinia, Albania, and Greece. Japan's crime is the unprovoked attack on its neighbor, China. Their aggression has destroyed the Western civilization that gradually developed in Europe after the Dark Ages. We are closely related to these sudden events, and the harm they cause within and beyond the borders of unfortunate Europe is something we cannot fully comprehend. The growth of freedom has been slow and steady. We initially believed that freedom would soon be recognized as the universal system for the entire world, but the Nazi rulers suddenly overthrew freedom, destroyed it, and attempted to establish an order in the world with themselves as masters and others as slaves. Within their territories, they do not allow the existence of individual freedom and rights. Outside their territories, they do not allow the retention of other countries' independence. Both domestic and international laws have been struck down by them. They use secret police instead of law, making individual freedom unsafe under the secret police's cruel terrorism. This is the so-called new order we face today. They have openly declared themselves to be enemies of us and our order, and are gradually encircling our Western Hemisphere. Their advance agents are already active in the republics to our south, establishing strategic air routes that run through critical parts of South America, winding towards our Panama Canal. Their armed forces are currently threatening the Western Hemisphere, seeking a foothold from which to leap to the coast of Brazil. Their propagandists are conducting extensive activities among our own people. Hitler and his military advisors, with any opportunity, will skillfully use their power to instill reactionary ideas of intolerance and hatred into the immature minds of young people. Moreover, they take advantage of modern science to secretly build a mechanized army of unprecedented strength while other countries are sleeping peacefully. They also use various deceptions and propaganda methods to catch other countries unprepared and launch sudden attacks. Now they are forcing the world, including us, to choose between two paths: either humiliating surrender or uncompromising resistance. I do not recall whether America has ever succumbed to this demand in its history. Now, please consider whether there is a need to change our national policy. First, Hitler's so-called new order is neither new nor can it ever establish order in this world. The barbaric and lawless Hitler regime is merely a temporary reaction that occurs during the long process of human progress. Since humans have existed hundreds of thousands of years ago, ambitious individuals have repeatedly attempted to conquer the world and humanity's freedom, but they have never succeeded for long. In the past, as in the future, Hitler seized the opportunity of the dissatisfaction during the chaotic period after the Great War to rule over people who were inherently docile and had repeatedly obeyed autocratic regimes, giving up their true freedom. He also skillfully seized many unexpected events that were originally easy to prevent, allowing him to rise up. Those who defend freedom, however, often suffered terribly during emergencies due to slight carelessness. But humanity will eventually progress again on the path of freedom, with new spirit and new knowledge gained from past unfortunate experiences, just as it did before. It is not only laughable, but also despicable, to believe that Hitler has established a permanent new world order because of fear," Stimson continued his suggestion that the U.S. Navy should fully assist Britain, saying, "We have built and maintained the Navy for many years. If our Navy today enables our munitions to safely pass through the sea to Britain, then the Navy is serving our country and maintaining our freedom as greatly as it has served in its glorious history. The U.S. Navy's assistance to the British Navy's efforts can preserve the safety of the oceans around the Americas. In this way, it can contain the tide of Nazism, awaiting the completion of other defenses by democratic countries, and finally permanently prevent the ruthless armies of the totalitarianists from displaying their power and leading them to defeat, and helping the tide of freedom rise again. But if our country delays aid until the strength of the British Navy and nation is defeated, then what the U.S. Navy can do now will be reduced to a very small and insignificant extent. If we allow the present urgency to pass and sit idly by while the strength of the British Navy disappears, then our Navy will only become a secondary force and will no longer be in a position to play a significant role in the world struggle. We have now made a resolute decision to proceed along the established course. The President has made speeches and appeals, explaining the dangers we face. The majority of the people have responded to the President's appeal in Congress. We have determined to be the shield of democratic countries in combat, resisting aggressive countries and defending our freedom. We have provided billions of dollars worth of munitions to carry out this defense. We also hold the tools to make these steps effective. At this time, how can the American people allow this critical period to pass by, shrinking back and listening to these munitions sink into the Atlantic Ocean? There is no precedent in our country's history for such an assumption to come true. The U.S. government or people have never given anyone reason to believe that such irresponsible and indecisive actions are possible. The German side is currently implementing unrestricted submarine warfare in the North Atlantic, sinking ships without warning and without saving the lives of the crew. According to the rules of naval warfare, this kind of submarine warfare is not a legitimate blockade. The United States has never recognized it as legitimate. U.S. spokesmen have repeatedly stated at international conferences that this submarine warfare is equivalent to piracy. In 1917, the U.S. President and Congress took up arms to maintain the freedom of the seas, prompted by this unrestricted submarine warfare, which violated the law and disregarded humanity. Hitler has not only torn up the provisions of international law, but has also expanded his illegal activities to the Western Hemisphere. Our government is currently proceeding cautiously, but for the sake of our own defense, the illegal aggression in the ocean must be limited. The President has said that we will not allow the steps we have taken to become ineffective. I do not take lightly the dangers we face. Now is the time for serious response, not depression or discouragement. I recall studying the military goals of the Axis powers and do not underestimate the bravery of their soldiers, but I also know the drive, talent, and courage of our people. I am familiar with the national defense plans currently being devised by our army and navy leaders. As long as we seek to use agile tactics and a spirit of unity, I believe the results will be satisfactory. Our freedom is a priceless treasure. Some people believe that this freedom can be preserved without sacrifice, but I am not one of them. It is impossible to preserve freedom without sacrifice. For billions of years, humanity's painstaking efforts have gradually achieved a better and more humane civilization, not without sacrifice. Today, a few evil people in Germany are destroying the freedom of others and other countries, teaching their youth, and these youth are prepared to die for this evil belief. If we are not prepared to sacrifice, not prepared to sacrifice ourselves when necessary to preserve America's belief in freedom, then our freedom will not be preserved. The only way to preserve freedom is to prepare for sacrifice."</p>
<p>In his speech, Stimson mentioned the strategic state on which American defense relies to defend against major dangers, saying, "The American people are greatly blessed by geography, with two great oceans to the east and west, and friendly neighbors to the north and south. We do not fear the intentions and power of our friends. What we value is naval defense. The Atlantic Ocean lies between Europe and America, and the Pacific Ocean lies between Asia and America, which can provide us with protection. If these oceans are always under the control of ourselves or our friends, they will be an unbreakable boundary, separated from any army that any aggressive country can assemble. However, the friendly control of the oceans is a very important condition. Without this condition, the oceans will quickly turn into an open path for attacking us. The development of modern air power has made the friendly control of the oceans even more necessary. Today, we must not only control the ocean roads adjacent to our coasts, but also the entire ocean road surrounding the Western Hemisphere. Because if an enemy country with a strong army and air force can land on the coast of a small and weak neighbor to our south or north, then the safety we enjoy will no longer exist. To that extent, it will not be difficult for the enemy country to establish its air force base within reach of our industrial cities, and to that extent, the only way our country can defend against foreign insults is to maintain a huge army, a burdensome method of controlling thousands of miles of the American continent beyond our borders. This situation will transform the current real neighborly relations between the American republics into an evil system of military domination that the Western Hemisphere does not want. In other words, the friendly control of the surrounding oceans is a condition for the existing mutual independence and freedom of the American nations. For more than a hundred years, the control of the Atlantic Ocean has been exercised by the British fleet. Due to the Washington Treaty of 1922, Britain voluntarily agreed to share this power equally with the United States. From then on, the United States had the same control as Britain. The British and Americans share the same language and the same observations of the traditions of freedom, and the people of our country who are of British descent account for more than fifty percent. Therefore, we regard Britain as the most important factor in the naval defense on which our safety and life depend. This is the characteristic of the situation in the past hundred years. In this century, we have adjusted our lives according to this situation. We have not maintained a strong standing army, and we have built densely populated cities on the coast, and these cities are vulnerable to attacks from the Atlantic Ocean. In short, the way of national life we have adopted depends on the continuation of British naval power, and British naval power is something we do not feel anxious about. Today, this situation is greatly threatened. The British Isles, which are the fortress against the violent countries threatening our coast from the north Atlantic, are now threatened by aerial attacks and naval blockades. If the British government is overthrown due to starvation or attack, then even if the British fleet can survive, it will lack sufficient bases to exert its power. In this environment, our fleet will not be able to fully protect the Western Hemisphere from irresistible naval power. Even today, our tonnage is still not equal to the total tonnage of the combined Axis powers. If the enemy has the advantage in shipbuilding capacity, then the oceans surrounding us will eventually fall into their hands. Moreover, we are only now beginning to build our military and air defenses. It will take at least two years to have a sufficient army and air force to defend against the Axis powers' air and land forces that can attack our country when they have naval power. Ten months ago, we began to prepare for air and land defenses, and the progress is satisfactory. However, in this vast country, it will take at least two years to train a force capable of resisting the German air force and army that has been developed for six years. Time is a key factor. Once naval power is lost, time will never be regained. Today, the British Navy is threatened in the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and Malaya. This distribution of British ships in various places is the only element that gives us valuable time. All these facts are not new. If we pay attention, these facts are revealed to us. The motivation for our government's policy is here, and our people understand this motivation and support the path taken by the government. Therefore, Congress not only passed huge national defense appropriation bills, but also passed the Lend-Lease Act to support Britain and others," (Reuters dispatch, 7th).</p>
<p>Opinions Vary Among People in the United States on This</p>
<p>Washington—Although Secretary of War Stimson's speech advocating that the United States escort aid to Britain has aroused fierce criticism from senators who advocate non-interventionism, the government seems to be very supportive of Stimson's speech, as the government's sentiment to aid Britain more effectively is also constantly increasing. Nevada Democratic Senator McCarran said, "According to the meaning expressed by the Secretary of State, it means that we have the right to participate in the war, but our naval strength is not a strength used to threaten the world, but a strength used to announce to the world that we are not afraid of aggression. We should first defend the United States, and naval strength should be regarded as sacred and inviolable. If we split this force, then we will become weak." Indiana Democratic Senator Gais said, "I strongly oppose it." Idaho Democratic Senator Clark declared, "Stimson should abide by what he said, that our navy is our first line of defense, and cannot be used as our first line of attack." Iowa Democratic Senator Gillette said that Stimson's speech showed a complete lack of candor and fairness towards the American people, which is the characteristic of American foreign policy in the past few months (United Press dispatch, 7th).</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Arrives in New York and Gives a Speech</h3>
<p>New York—Australian Prime Minister Menzies said last night upon arriving here, "The United States can make great contributions to humanity in air warfare and to the Battle of the Atlantic. The whole world is now watching quietly to see how long it will take for American military supplies to reach the peak of their capacity. Australia's natural interest in European politics is no greater than that of the United States. Australia, like you, is far away from Europe and lives its own life. But this war is not about European politics, but about the politics of all mankind. What the world is asking of you is not donations to charity, but a way to defend your lives." Menzies ended by saying, "All the people believe that this war affects you no less than it affects us." (Reuters dispatch, 6th).</p>

<h3>Outlook on the Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>The flames of war in Europe have spread to the East with the Iraq incident, and Japan has also secured a guarantee of no worries in the north from the Soviet Union. However, the Pacific Ocean remains calm, and in the short term, there seems to be no sign of sudden changes.</p>
<p>Matsuoka's trip to Europe did not significantly enhance the Tripartite Pact. On the contrary, what Japan is most concerned about recently is not the interests of the Axis powers, but its own pressing issues. Whether Matsuoka's talk of visiting the United States and inviting the U.S. authorities to Japan has any practical significance is debatable, but it clearly violates the original intention of allying with the Axis powers. When that alliance was first concluded last autumn, Japanese public opinion was once rampant, and even Konoe and Matsuoka made extravagant claims of not hesitating to fight the United States. Now, the Soviet-Japanese diplomatic deadlock, which Japan was once so worried about, has been considerably eased, and the Axis powers have also achieved new victories in the European war. Japan's situation is undoubtedly more favorable than in the autumn and winter of last year, but its attitude is far more restrained. Judging from the recent attitude of the Japanese authorities, it would be absurd to assert that a Pacific storm will not arise, but at least this crisis is not more imminent than it was some time ago. Considering Japan's recent situation: the Sino-Japanese war has not ended, the Soviet Union is trying to separate German-Japanese relations, and what Matsuoka personally witnessed during this trip to the war may all be enough to prompt the Japanese authorities to become more cautious. The biggest problem in all of this is probably that the current international situation may allow the Japanese authorities to relive their dreams of peaceful expansion.</p>
<p>Southern advancement is undoubtedly Japan's national policy, but what steps it will take is another matter entirely. Warmongering is a common trait of aggressive warlords, but winning without fighting is the ultimate ideal of all ambitious expansionists. Especially in countries already plagued by prolonged wars, launching new wars is not necessarily seen as desirable. Even with the strength of the Nazi military, its management of the Balkans only had to resort to force at the very last moment, and the same can be said of others. The Japanese authorities have repeatedly stated recently that they are willing to satisfy their desire for southern advancement by means other than force, which may truly be the inner desire of the Japanese clique. Especially when the European situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the United States' attention is mostly drawn to events across the Atlantic, it is unwilling to see more incidents in the Far East. This situation is where Japan places its hopes. In addition, after the conclusion of the Soviet-Japanese treaty, France, Japan, the Netherlands, and India have also successively concluded trade agreements with Japan. If this diplomatic path can continue to develop, then war may not necessarily be a necessary step for southern advancement.</p>
<p>However, judging from the recent movements of the United States, the above-mentioned fantasy has clearly fallen through. Last winter, U.S. President Roosevelt stated that even if the United States were drawn into a war in the Pacific, it would not hinder its support for Britain. Some people ridiculed this at the time, believing that empty words would not help in practice. However, recent experience has proven that the United States' determination and strength are indeed sufficient to match Roosevelt's statement. Of course, the failure to clarify the Far East issue before the expansion of the European war is a major regret, but the U.S. authorities' consistent disdain for appeasement policies and their refusal to give any leniency to aggressors is precisely what sets them apart in terms of wisdom. Recently, the voices for U.S. participation in the war and escorting convoys have been rising. Even government authorities no longer shy away from it. President Roosevelt's speech commemorating Wilson on the 4th of this month, and Secretary of War Stimson's proposal to use the navy to carry out escorts, all indicate that the United States has reached a point where it can no longer tolerate sitting idly by in the European situation and has reached the edge of war. But at the same time, it has always maintained a consistent and active policy in the Far East. Its aid to China has recently reached unprecedented levels, and may even increase further. General public opinion in the U.S., both in the government and among the people, has never neglected the Pacific, and the arguments in Congress are even more urgent than those regarding Europe. Judging from these facts, coupled with the unparalleled strength of the United States, it can be asserted that even if the United States is truly and unfortunately drawn into the whirlpool of the European war, it will be able to maintain a fully prepared vigilance in the Far East with sufficient strength. This trend stems partly from the fundamental belief of the United States in upholding democracy and opposing aggression and violence, and partly from the necessary measures to maintain its own rights and interests. Neither empty threats nor sweet enticements will cause it to waver in any way.</p>
<p>Japan has no sincerity in repenting of its wrongdoings, and the United States is unwilling to repeat the mistakes of appeasement policies. Therefore, the demand for a peaceful resolution of the U.S.-Japan pending issues can only be a fantasy. The recent calm in the Pacific is indeed a fact, but beneath this calm lies a hidden danger, and its future changes will mainly depend on the changes in the entire international future.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - During the House of Representatives' discussion of the convoy issue today, Democratic Congressman Patrick expressed the opinion that the United States should immediately take measures to escort military equipment to Britain, because if Britain fails, the United States will no longer be able to protect the security of both oceans. The only plan for now is for the United States to send a fleet to escort military equipment to Britain. (Havas Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>The Chinese Side Expresses Enthusiastic Approval of Mr. Stimson's Speech</p>
<p>CHONGQING - This morning, all Chinese people here expressed sincere approval of the speeches made by U.S. Secretary of War Stimson and Florida Democratic Senator Pepper. They believed that Mr. Stimson's speech was even more important to China than Senator Pepper's. Political figures believed that, given Mr. Stimson's position, his speech was obviously permitted by the U.S. government, and they believed that Mr. Stimson's words undoubtedly placed the United States on the side of the anti-aggressors. It was generally believed that the Secretary of War's speech was a clear analysis of the U.S.'s position on the current world situation. Chinese people often felt that the U.S. public's understanding of the international situation was not clear enough, but Mr. Stimson's speech dispelled all of the above feelings of the Chinese people. Therefore, the Chinese people especially welcomed Mr. Stimson's speech. People here also said that Mr. Stimson's proposal that the United States should be the naval support for Britain in the Atlantic war was a "targeted" argument. If the United States does not provide escort, there is no other way to ensure that U.S. aid supplies safely reach Britain. Political figures also said that the Chinese people have great respect for Mr. Stimson because Mr. Stimson took a firm stand when the Manchurian Incident occurred. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Britain Believes Mr. Stimson's Speech is a Major Contribution to the Current Situation</p>
<p>LONDON - People here have recently welcomed U.S. Secretary of War Stimson's speech last night advocating that the U.S. fleet protect navigation to ensure that military supplies reach Britain, and they believe that Mr. Stimson's remarks are a great contribution to the general situation. Political figures expect that a senior official of the British government may soon make a statement, because it is already recognized here that Mr. Stimson's speech is very important to Britain's war effort. The British Broadcasting Corporation has broadcast the main points of Mr. Stimson's speech in German, leaving nothing out. The company also quoted Washington news as saying that U.S. officials have recognized that Mr. Stimson's speech is tantamount to an official announcement that the U.S. Navy will soon be forced to join the Atlantic war. The company also obtained many people's views on Mr. Stimson's speech, but because they are waiting for the official British response, they are not publishing them for the time being. All morning newspapers published this news in a special position. The Daily Mail's Washington correspondent believes that this speech is the strongest view ever seen in the speeches of American politicians, and believes that it is a call to encourage the American people and a stern warning to Germany. The New Chronicle's New York correspondent believes that the guidance needed by the American people and already announced by the U.S. government has now arrived. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>President Roosevelt Convenes a Cabinet Meeting to Plan to Increase Heavy Bombers</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - President Roosevelt convened cabinet members and heads of the army and navy yesterday to discuss the issue of accelerating the manufacture of bombers. Attendees included Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Secretary of the Navy Knox, Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins, Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Chief of Naval Operations Stark, and Chief of the Army Air Corps Arnold. One of the main purposes of the meeting was to consider the need for the rapid production of heavy bombers. It is reported that President Roosevelt hopes to produce 500 heavy bombers per month. White House officials said that yesterday's meeting gave Arnold, who had just returned to the U.S. from Britain, the opportunity to give a detailed report to what some parties called the "War Cabinet." President Roosevelt entrusted Army and Navy Munitions Committee member Pence to assist Hopkins in handling the details of the aid to Britain program. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - According to an announcement by the authorities, the number of U.S. military and civilian aircraft manufactured in October reached a total of 1,493, an increase of 217 from March. In addition, the Vought Aircraft Manufacturing Plant has decided to establish a new plant in California, employing 7,100 workers. (Havas Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>The U.S. and Canada Establish a Mixed Committee to Adjust Production</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Well-informed sources here have recently said that the United States and the Canadian Federation plan to establish a mixed committee in the near future, dedicated to adjusting the production industries of the two countries, in order to accelerate aid to Britain. After the establishment of this committee, its first task will be to implement the accelerated production plan proposed by President Roosevelt. It is generally expected that the President will make a statement on this matter in the near future. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Senator Pepper Declares That U.S. Aircraft Should Fiercely Attack Tokyo</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Senator Pepper (Democrat from Florida) said in a speech in the Senate that all Americans are already willing to shed blood to extinguish Germany, and are anxiously awaiting the order from the responsible government leaders to defeat the Axis powers. Sacrificing lives now is far cheaper than sending expeditionary troops in the future. Mr. Pepper's words were extremely enthusiastic, and he strongly advocated sending troops to occupy key locations in the Far East to crush Japan. He said, "At this moment on the external front, it is time to be tough on people. The United States should cooperate with Britain to occupy Dakar, Cape Verde Islands, and other key points in Africa to the United States and Greenland. President Roosevelt should declare a state of full national emergency and accelerate aid to democratic countries. The United States should send troops to occupy various places in the Far East and imprison the Japanese navy in its nest. Fifty first-class U.S. aircraft, with dozens of pilots, can turn Tokyo into rubble. Dropping bombs on Tokyo is the only document that Japan can understand. Although I do not believe that there are already these aircraft on the way, I very much hope that this is the case. The United States must now take aggressive actions in order to imprison the Axis powers from exiting Europe, Asia, and Africa." Since the outbreak of the European war, Mr. Pepper has been a prophet in the government's foreign policy, and most of the actions he advocated have been adopted by the government later. His remarks this time have attracted special attention from all parties, and it is expected that the isolationists will respond. Mr. Pepper cited the figures from public opinion surveys, confirming that if there is no other way to prevent the victory of the Axis powers, the American people are determined to fight a war, and he advocated revising the law prohibiting China from employing pilots in the U.S. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Rumor That a Large Number of U.S. Pursuit Aircraft Will Be Transported to Chongqing via China</p>
<p>CHONGQING - It has long been rumored here that a large number of U.S. pursuit aircraft are on their way here, but this saying cannot be confirmed. This evening, after Senator Pepper of Florida made a passionate speech, expressing hope that U.S. aircraft are on their way to the Far East, this rumor was further strengthened. Some sources said that the U.S. aircraft will arrive soon, and that a full complement of U.S. pilots and ground crew will come with the aircraft. At the same time, aviation circles here pointed out that although China's aviation may have been silent last year, it has actually stepped up training of a large number of ground crew, and the equipment has also been improved. The airfield can immediately accommodate hundreds of U.S. aircraft. Mr. Pepper said that 50 U.S. aircraft, flown by U.S. crew seasoned by righteous experience, can cause a great massacre in Tokyo. All quarters in China warmly welcome this statement. It is believed that Mr. Pepper's speech indicates that the United States will truly aid China with aircraft, or even personnel, and will arrive in China soon. An official said, "It is gratifying that Mr. Pepper understands that only force can make Japan understand. I fully agree with this view." (United Press Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Stalin Succeeds as Chairman of the People's Committee, Concentrating Party and Government Power in One Person, Molotov Deputies, Still Serving as Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>MOSCOW - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently issued the following order: (1) Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs Molotov has repeatedly stated that he is unable to take care of two heavy tasks. It has been decided to accept Mr. Molotov's request and relieve Mr. Molotov of his post as Chairman of the People's Committee. (2) Appoint Stalin as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union. (3) Appoint People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs Molotov as Vice Chairman of the People's Committee. (TASS Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>MOSCOW - Stalin's appointment as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars (i.e., Prime Minister of the Soviet Union) has brought to an end the illogical situation in which Mr. Stalin led the entire Soviet Union in name only as Secretary General of the Communist Party. There is no news of Mr. Stalin giving up the post of Secretary General of the Communist Party. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Stalin's Status is Almost Equal to Lenin's</p>
<p>LONDON - The Moscow radio station announced that Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Commissar, has been removed from the post of Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, and Stalin has taken over the post himself. This is the first time that Stalin has held a government position, as Mr. Stalin has always only held the post of Secretary General of the Communist Party. After Stalin accepted the positions of head of government and leader of the Communist Party, his status has become comparable to the previous position of Lenin. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Observes Changes in Situations and Cannot Avoid Being Involved in the War</p>
<p>The London Observer attaches great importance to Stalin's self-appointment as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union, calling it sufficient to reflect that the Soviet Union is gradually believing that it cannot avoid being involved in the war. Although most experts are unwilling to draw hasty conclusions, they also recall that for five months, Moscow has been deeply disturbed by Germany's arrogance. Stalin's combination of the ruling power of the government and the ruling power of the party in one person is worthy of attention. It is quite coincidental that the German army is now extending to the Dardanelles, has controlled the west coast of the Black Sea, and has incited Arab unrest. Stalin's position is comparable to Lenin's, and it is probably inevitable that new international tensions will occur. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>NEW YORK - According to a Central Broadcasting Station report of a British Broadcasting Corporation news, after Stalin was appointed as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union's policy often changed when it applied new offensives against Germany. "The Soviet Union has refused Germany's request to join the Axis powers, and has signed friendship treaties with both countries before the German invasion of the South." According to this, Stalin came to power at a time when Germany was advancing eastward and threatening what the Soviet Union called its sphere of influence in Asia.

<p>It is Expected That Diplomatic Policy Will Not Change for a While</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - The news that Molotov resigned from his post as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union but did not relinquish his post as Foreign Minister caused speculation among senior figures here yesterday. It was said that the most important thing was the role of the Bald Department. Most American and foreign observers here believe that this statement from Moscow is not as important as Molotov's complete dismissal. Mr. Molotov's continued employment, first of all, is sufficient to indicate that Stalin is gradually readjusting Molotov's powers, and secondly, that the Soviet Union's diplomatic policy will not change much in the future. Only Stalin will attempt to enhance his internal political position through the superficial path of occupying an important position. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Iraqi Troops Withdraw from Positions Around Habbaniyah, A Large Number of British Reinforcements Arrive in Basra, Oil Pipeline Sentry Posts Also Recaptured by British Troops</h3>
<p>CAIRO - The British Air Force Headquarters in the Middle East issued a special communique stating that Iraqi troops have withdrawn from several positions around Habbaniyah. The positions along the oil pipeline previously occupied by the Iraqi army have been recaptured by British troops. The situation in the area near the British Air Force Station in Habbaniyah has been greatly eased. British night patrols discovered that the Iraqi positions on the edge of the highlands above Habbaniyah were unoccupied, and there were no traces of rebels on the plains south of the army's encampment. The communique also recounted the recapture of the oil pipeline sentry posts, saying that when a British reconnaissance plane flew over the sentry posts, the rebels waved white flags to indicate their surrender, and British army troops immediately occupied the sentry posts. According to the previous communique, the situation in Basra is still very calm. The Iraqi claim that fierce fighting is taking place there is completely unfounded. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>ROME - A telegram from "Stefani News Agency" in Istanbul yesterday stated that approximately 3,000 British and Australian troops were surrounded by Iraqi troops at the Habbaniyah airfield, 65 miles from Baghdad. The Iraqi troops were unable to attack because the airfield was surrounded by high-voltage electrified wire fences. Therefore, the Iraqi Air Force attempted to destroy the power plant. It is reported that the plant was built underground. The telegram also stated that British troops occupied the port of Basra and its station without conflict with Iraqi troops.

<p>Britain Will Not Negotiate with the Illegal Regime in Iraq</p>
<p>ANKARA - As a result of discussions between the Turkish government and the ambassadors of Iran and Afghanistan and the Iraqi envoy, Turkey has proposed mediating the British-Iraqi incident. On May 3, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu met with British Ambassador Hughessen and offered Turkey's goodwill. Two days later, Hughessen delivered the British response. People here have repeatedly pointed out that Turkey is extremely concerned about the resolution of the Iraqi situation, but its work feels very difficult, because according to Iraqi people here, Ali Gailani, the leader of the Iraqi rebel government, must wait until British troops withdraw from Iraqi territory before he is prepared to negotiate.

<p>CAIRO - The Iraqi war expanded to new areas yesterday. The British made a solemn statement that there can be no negotiations between Britain and Iraq unless the "illegal" Iraqi government lays down its arms. The British Air Force patrolled everywhere, preventing Iraqi reinforcements from arriving at the Habbaniyah military district and bombing four Iraqi troop concentrations and the Baghdad-Basra highway. According to news from the London Express, the British Air Force is constantly on guard against German troops passing through Syria. The newspaper predicted that if German troops take this action, then "Britain will not allow it and will take action regardless of Vichy's reaction. If that happens, a major war in the Near East will break out." (International News Agency Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Britain Prevents Germany from Passing Through Syria, The Iraqi Minister of Defense Visits Ankara</p>
<p>LONDON - British military experts warned today that if Hitler wants to take Syria to aid Iraq, a major crisis may occur in the Middle East. Germany's adventurous strike on Syria seems imminent. News here says that Britain is patrolling day and night in the eastern Mediterranean airspace to see if there are any German troop transport planes flying to Iraq. At the same time, military experts said that they believe the British fleet can prevent strong German troops from landing in Syria from the sea, so what they are worried about is the German planes flying to Iraq. Turkey's European border is also closely guarded, because it is heard that a large number of German striking forces are concentrated in the Balkans. (United Press Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>VICHY - Cabinet Coordinator Darlan is currently in Paris holding talks with the German authorities. Although diplomatic circles here attach great importance to it, they say that this conversation is still in the initial stages and may not have any immediate results. It is noted that Darlan only brought the confidential secretary of the Navy Department with him each time he went to Paris, but this time he brought another secretary, which shows that the mission this time is more arduous, but there is no need for the assistance of technical experts at this time.

It is rumored that Darlan threatened that otherwise Germany would "obtain what it wants by force." It is also learned that Darlan threatened to overthrow Pétain because Darlan accused Pétain of putting pressure on Spanish dictator Franco to reject Germany's request for Spain to cooperate in attacking Gibraltar.

<h3>U.S. Government Orders Ban on Machine Exports to Soviet Union; Justified by Diversion to Aid Britain; U.S.-Soviet Relations Worsen Again</h3>
<p>Washington: According to responsible sources, the U.S. government has today ordered a ban on the export of various machines and factory equipment to the Soviet Union for use as production tools. The Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. had recently tried his utmost to obtain export licenses for machinery ordered by the Soviet Union months ago, but to no avail. (Havas Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>New York: The U.S. government has halted the export to the Soviet Union of all materials that could be used for defense production. Consequently, about one hundred Soviet purchasing agents and Soviet communist personnel are preparing to leave the U.S. immediately. This was disclosed by the lawyer defending Soviet immigrant Ufanski Min after his arrest. Ufanski was arrested on Monday because he only registered as a foreign agent when preparing to leave the U.S. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: Following the U.S. announcement of the re-imposition of a ban on all machine exports, the Soviet Union's armaments industry will be greatly affected. It is widely expected that U.S.-Soviet relations will become even more strained as a result. According to reliable sources here, export licenses already issued for machinery destined for the Soviet Union are also being revoked. The ostensible reason for this U.S. action is that these machines are needed to aid Britain, but the real reason is the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. (Haitong Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Confiscation of Foreign Ships Bill Expected to Pass Congress</h3>
<p>Washington: The government's initial major test on the issue of confiscating foreign ships in U.S. ports has been successful, as an amendment prohibiting the transfer of Axis ships to Britain was defeated by the House of Representatives by a vote of 131 to 94. Despite repeated warnings that this move would plunge the U.S. into "the longest and bloodiest war in history," the amendment was ultimately rejected. Last night, some predicted that the rejection of the amendment indicates that the bill will be passed.

Lieutenant General Cunningham, Commander of the British Forces in East Africa, welcomed the Emperor into the city. The glorious battles of the British forces in Abyssinia are now nearing their end, and it is all due to Cunningham's efforts that Abyssinia was freed from Italian shackles and returned to its Emperor.

The people were extremely excited upon the Emperor's entry into the city, but Italians remaining in Addis Ababa remained indoors. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3>North African Front: Scorching Heat and Flying Sand; Endurance of Nazi Soldiers Faces Its First Major Test</h3>
<p>Cairo: Well-informed military sources here say that the western desert is currently filled with sandstorms and scorching heat, which is testing the endurance of German troops in the Sollum to Tobruk area. The battle situation remains the same as yesterday. Enemy attacks appear to have proven to be extremely costly. British forces in Abyssinia are gradually encircling Amba Alagi from the northwest and west, and progress is good. Observers returning from the western desert say that the German troops there are heavily affected by the conditions. German prisoners' diaries often mention the scorching heat and lack of water. The dive-bombing of German aircraft is also frequently mentioned. There are rumors that the Germans trained their troops on Baltic Sea beaches for desert warfare, and forced them to train in glass houses to acclimatize them to the stifling heat. This rumor does not seem unfounded. German tanks have proven unsuitable for desert warfare, and British mobile units are often able to approach and destroy German tanks. (Reuters Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Cairo: Regarding the East African campaign, the following war report has been released: (1) Indian troops advancing from Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea, have advanced 200 miles south of the city and are engaged in fierce fighting with Italian troops who are resisting from the mountains.

<h3>Lord Privy Seal Defends Himself Against Criticism from Mr. Hore-Belisha</h3>
<p>Within less than an hour of the debate's commencement, the discussion on the war situation transitioned into a more moderate exchange. Its essence can be found in the Liberal Party member Mr. Harris' succinct comment: "We are now firmly united behind the Prime Minister, but we must not deny that constructive criticism is necessary." Subsequently, Mr. Smith, a leading Labour Party MP seated on the front row, raised several questions. Like other remarks, these questions expressed doubts about the efficiency of British intelligence and whether all advice or information was always given full consideration. Regarding the justification for sending troops to aid Greece, none of the MPs expressed dissent. The sharpest speech was delivered by Mr. Hore-Belisha, who argued that if Italy had been bombed in time, Greece could have been saved. He also stated that the British Expeditionary Force was understrength, that intelligence was erroneous and its interpretation was flawed, and he described the Battle of Matapan as a lure that allowed the Germans to transfer a large army to North Africa. Mr. Hore-Belisha claimed that Britain had suffered a failure in Iraq. He demanded improved intelligence, more armored vehicles, tanks, dive-bombers, and transport aircraft. While he acknowledged recent progress in these areas, he deemed it insufficient. Lord Privy Seal Attlee responded to Mr. Hore-Belisha's criticisms, stating that Mr. Hore-Belisha was in charge of a large part of British military preparations until 1940 (to which the audience responded with laughter). He dared to assert that when Mr. Hore-Belisha was at the War Office, he must have felt that everything he did was constrained by what his predecessors had done, and that they are feeling the same way today. Mr. Attlee also said that the precariousness of Britain's position in the summer and autumn of last year was far greater than it is today. Greece's glorious resistance, General Cunningham's achievements in Abyssinia, and General Wavell's victory in Libya had brought brilliant light to dark days, but the fundamental fact that the overall situation in Europe was in the hands of the enemy had not changed as a result. While the House of Commons was holding its debate, the House of Lords also raised similar questions and held its own debate. After several hours of discussion, the House of Lords unanimously passed a motion of confidence in the government. The debate in the House of Commons is still ongoing. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>

The Colonial Secretary also mentioned the British victory in Africa, saying that in the past five months, British forces led by General Wavell had captured 200,000 enemy troops, and that the Italian army had suffered a total loss of 380,000 men.

<h3>British Parliament Convenes; Eden Reports on the War Situation; Reasons for Failure in the Balkan Campaign; Welcomes the Great Step of American Assistance; House of Lords Passes Motion of Confidence in the Government</h3>
<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Eden began a debate in the House of Commons yesterday on the war situation. The main points of his statement were: (1) The rumor that there were differences of opinion between the British General Staff and the Middle East Command regarding the dispatch of troops to aid Greece is a malicious message and is not true. (2) South African Prime Minister Smuts personally came to Cairo and asked him to declare on his behalf that he strongly supports the decision to aid Greece. (3) South Africa did not mobilize quickly before the coup, and only began to seriously prepare for war after the coup, but it was too late to curb the rapid advance of the German army. (4) He was deeply impressed by the loyalty and friendship of Turkish politicians and their determination to safeguard their sovereignty and interests. He knows that Turkey's loyalty to the British alliance is indeed the foundation of Turkish foreign policy. (5) He very much welcomes the important step taken by the United States to decide to send ships through the Red Sea. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Eden Reveals Nazi Conspiracy at the Beginning of His Speech</h3>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, Eden reported to the House of Commons on all the recent events, especially the difficulties of the Near East campaign, saying, "What is said in this debate is heard not only by us, but also by others. I originally wished to say more, but I am forced by circumstances to remain silent at present. I must limit my words to avoid being heard by the enemy and helping their activities. In the early days of January, the German side had gathered a large army in Romania and secretly moved troops into Bulgaria one after another. In the view of the British government, this seemed to be the German side's plan to use troops in the early spring. German plainclothes soldiers entered Bulgarian territory and occupied positions at airfields. Their purpose was obviously to use their known method to occupy Romania, gradually devastate the Balkan Peninsula, penetrate Bulgaria, surround South Africa, subdue Greece, and make Turkey dare not move. Thus, based on this position, without firing a shot, it could launch a major blow against our position in the Eastern Mediterranean from its solid base. This German plan naturally had a side effect, namely, to aid the Italian army which was fighting unsuccessfully in Albania. Hitler described to people how brave the Italian army was in combat, and said that he had congratulated the Italian army because they had defeated Greece. It is necessary to know that defeating 7 million people with 45 million people, such congratulations is almost an insult to Italy. The Greek army in Albania, though aided by our air force, fought against more numerous and superior combatants. All who observed this battle must have had the impression that it was a battle of an outnumbered force vanquishing a superior force, unprecedented in history.</p>
<h3>Fulfilling the Obligation to Aid Greece; Cease Further Advance in North Africa</h3>
<p>After our army entered Benghazi in North Africa on February 8, it fought hard for a long time and had to rest and reorganize. This armored force had not only been advancing continuously for two months, but had also been fighting for more than two months without rest. After capturing Benghazi, it was impossible to order it to continue advancing. If it is said that this force should drive straight to Tripoli, this is not a big problem. Our original plan was to stop advancing after capturing Tobruk and meet with the forces on the west wing. Later, because the military situation on this route was so smooth and the morale of the enemy was so low, we decided to take advantage of the victory to capture Benghazi. At that time, there was one more thing to consider, namely, the temporary unavailability of the port of Benghazi, which would take some time to repair. At this time, if we were to advance further, we would have to use the small port of Tobruk as a base, but although this port is good, it is too small after all. We must use the mouth of the Nile as the main base. On February 8, the British government received a letter from the Greek government, stating the Greek government's determination to resist Germany and requesting the British government to show what assistance it could give and the conditions under which Britain would give assistance. This letter from the Greek government was not a request for help, but explained its position and asked us to explain our position. Under these circumstances, the British government decided to maintain the previously decided method, stop the deep advance in the Benghazi desert, and prepare to send troops to aid Greece. This was decided by the British government and its main members. At that time, the situation clearly required that everything be prepared for rapid aid, and many difficult problems, such as the position of South Africa and the need to inform Turkey of our plans, remained to be discussed and resolved. The government believed that the best step was direct negotiations, so the British Chief of Staff and I were ordered to set off. We both knew that our mission would not be completely successful. We knew how carefully the German side had arranged and how powerful it was, but I knew that we would be responsible if we did not make every effort.</p>
<h3>Plan to Unite Greece Against Germany; South Africa Obtains Agreement</h3>
<p>Since the collapse of French combat power, the British army in the Middle East was forced to cope with the situation alone without the help of the French army. The number of British troops there was originally small in comparison, and unfortunately, the equipment was extremely scarce. In the early autumn of last year, the British government was deeply concerned about the situation in the Middle East. After General Wavell returned home and consulted with the Prime Minister, the government decided to risk strengthening the Middle East Army. Since then, armored forces, equipment, aircraft, and other equipment have been shipped out one after another. Generals Wavell and O'Connor were able to achieve such remarkable results in marching in the desert thanks to the power of this equipment and equipment. As far as our domestic equipment is concerned, this decision was extremely risky. Since then, we have been continuously transporting soldiers and equipment to the Middle East. Since the collapse of France, the fulfillment of the two obligations of supplying Turkey and guaranteeing Greece has been entirely borne by us. After our army arrived in Cairo, the three commanders of our side unanimously supported the policy advocated by London. We had decided in principle to send the land forces to be sent, and preparations for the concentration of troops were also underway. We unanimously decided to march on Athens. However, the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean, Cunningham, was then engaging enemy ships in the Battle of Matapan and did not participate in this decision. Both the Greek King and the Greek Prime Minister had clearly announced that Greece was determined to resist Germany as well as Italy. The Greek Prime Minister also declared that even without foreign aid, Greece would defend its territory. During the discussion, we told the Greek government what we knew about the German plans and finally decided to place the Allied British and Greek forces in the Harikman line to resist the German army. Military experts on both sides fully agreed with this quickly formed decision. At that time, we also sought the opinion of General Smuts. Smuts was a wise politician and a very experienced military expert. At my request, he came to Cairo. He fully agreed with this decision. He had made this point clear in his public remarks and asked me to declare his agreement."</p>
<h3>Southern Army Hastily Engaged: Reasons for Military Failure</h3>
<p>Eden read aloud a recent telegram from the Greek government to the British government, expressing gratitude for the British army's loyal and courageous assistance to Greece. It also declared a willingness to continue fighting alongside the British Empire until victory and the restoration of freedom, morality, and international justice were achieved. Eden then spoke of the southern country, saying, "When we arrived in the south, we received various assurances that they would resist Germany's aggression against the south. However, I believe that merely saying this is of no help. What is urgently needed is a joint plan so that when war breaks out, we have the best opportunity to defend against the enemy. I have repeatedly said this, but until the coup, it had no effect. During the talks, the southern government repeatedly said that the southern army was mobilizing. We repeatedly told the southern government that matters should be handled urgently, or it would be too late. The southern government always replied that it was already mobilizing and would be prepared when the situation became critical. In fact, the mobilization of the southern country was not carried out as quickly as possible. Only after the coup did the new government truly reorganize its military. However, it was too late to move its troops to the necessary places. Therefore, although the southern army was extremely brave, it engaged in battle hastily without an effective strategy and ultimately failed to prevent the German army from directly attacking the southern border of Serbia and reaching the Manastir mountain pass. Although it is useless to discuss the matter after the fact, if the southern government before the coup could have understood the true interests of the southern country as clearly as Prime Minister Simović, today's situation would certainly be different. However, the perseverance shown by the people of the southern country is not affected by this. Since we have made a guarantee to restore the independence of the southern country, we will definitely respect this promise."</p>
<h3>Turkey's Friendship with Britain Will Surely Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>"When we were in the Middle East, we often had the opportunity to talk with Turkish politicians. The Turkish government heard about our plans for Greece. I was deeply moved by the Turkish politicians' expression of loyal friendship towards Britain and the Turkish people's firm determination to safeguard national interests. Since the outbreak of the war, Turkey's independent policy has greatly helped us. Turkey is the backbone of the defense against future aggression in the Middle East. Its importance is clearly visible. I am confident that its loyalty to the Anglo-alliance will forever be the foundation of the Turkish government's foreign policy."</p>
<h3>Britain Decides to Protect Treaty Rights in Iraq</h3>
<p>Eden later spoke of Iraq, saying, "The illegal actions of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani have already caused him to lose power, and now he has forcibly seized power again. The British government sees no reason why this kind of incident in Iraq can deprive Britain of all treaty rights. Britain has no shameful record in its dealings with the Arabs, especially in its dealings with Iraqi history. It was Britain that made Iraq independent, and it was Britain that helped it establish the nation and keep its promises. I would like to show the world our current position. We are very grateful for the proposals of the Turkish and Egyptian governments for mediation. Now, our position is that the withdrawal of the Habbaniyah army and the cessation of hostile actions against the British army are prerequisites for mediation. If this can be done, the British government is prepared to discuss the implementation of its treaty rights. Britain, in any circumstances, must maintain these rights. Italian newspapers have long hoped that Britain would fail so that Italy could control Arab lands in North Africa and elsewhere. This is something that any Arab should know. In recent history, there has been no more brutal rule than that imposed by our country on the Arabs in Tripoli and Cyrenaica. Even Hitler is no better than this. On Sunday, Hitler told the world that he was a relevant bystander in the Balkans. According to this bystander, his rule is actually based on military power and secret police. The Arabs should know that the arrival of the Axis rule will be the elimination of their freedom." (Continued on page five)</p>

<h3>The Far East Situation Has Become Serious: All Parties Are Still Trying to Ease It; The United States Has Never Neglected the Pacific; Japan Is Clearly Unwilling to Make a Desperate Gamble</h3>
<p>An editorial in the English-language "China Press" stated that the dispatches from Tokyo, Washington, New York, and Batavia yesterday were sufficient to bring the situation in the Far East closer to a focal point. The situation in the Far East, in recent weeks, has wavered between optimism and defeatism. If these dispatches are correct, then in terms of the hope for peace, the situation is very serious, but it cannot be hastily concluded that peace in the Pacific is already hopeless.</p>
<p>Hoping that the Situation Will Avoid Becoming Serious</p>
<p>Whether it is goods or people, they firmly believe that these dispatches are sufficient to prove that the opinions of various countries around the world on the Far East, although different, are unified in their efforts to ease the seriousness of the situation. However, these dispatches are also sufficient to prove that the second step may not necessarily be the Oriental version of Lord Elgin. Japan will continue to be uneasy because of the United States' aid to Britain. At the same time, Japan hopes that the United States will focus its attention on the Atlantic and neglect the Pacific, as Japan wishes to see Britain defeated, so that the United States has no time to look west and allows Japan to dominate the Pacific. However, in fact, Britain has not been defeated, and the United States has not neglected the Pacific.</p>
<p>Japan Is Also Unwilling to Engage in War</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, Japan will certainly not act rashly and make a desperate gamble, and Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands have no intention of forcing Japan to war. From this perspective, if a war were to break out in the Far East, its instigator would certainly be Japan. However, it is also very clear that Japan is willing to avoid war and achieve its goals by peaceful means. But Japan, at least for now, cannot achieve its goal by peaceful means, and there is no other better way. At the same time, although we are juggling multiple tasks, we still have some time to breathe freely.</p>
<h3>Public Works Committee Meeting Today</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun," the Public Works Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council will hold its first meeting at 4:30 PM on the eighth at the Shanghai Municipal Council to discuss the issue of electricity reduction due to insufficient coal supply. It will review the report drafted jointly by the Shanghai Power Company and the Shanghai Municipal Council's experts on the fair power conservation by consumers. Due to the poor performance of large consumers in conserving electricity, the power company is struggling to cope. Therefore, it is hoped that the general plan for electricity reduction can be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>French Concession Sanitation Worker Strike: Negotiations Began Yesterday; Employers Will Handle the Commercial Press Strike Cautiously; Western and French Laundry Businesses Temporarily Suspend Operations</h3>
<p>The strike by the sanitation workers of the French Municipal Council has been ongoing for many days since they resumed work and then restriked over the issue of wage deductions. However, the French authorities believe that the prolonged stalemate of the strike is not a good plan, and with the arrival of summer, garbage is of great importance to hygiene, so they are trying to resolve it as soon as possible. It is reported that the police department has sent personnel to mediate, and it is also reported that the authorities and labor representatives held talks yesterday afternoon. It is generally expected that the strike has eased and may resume work within a few days if they can reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Laundry Suspends Operations to Prevent Accidents</p>
<p>The strike by all the workers in the Western and French laundry industry in this city has been ongoing since it occurred on the fourth of this month and has not yet been resolved. In order to avoid accidents among colleagues, the Shanghai Western and French Laundry Trade Association sent personnel to various laundry shops yesterday morning to advise them to temporarily suspend operations to prevent any unforeseen circumstances. It also notified the labor representatives that they must first resume work before starting negotiations. However, the labor representatives now feel the pain of the strike and can generally accept it, so they may resume work in the short term. In addition, the strike by all the drivers and workers of the Miller Transportation Company at 106 Beijing Road in this city has been ongoing since it occurred on the 29th of last month. Because of the large differences in opinion between the two parties, it has not yet been resolved. It is still difficult to predict when a resolution will be reached.</p>
<p>Commercial Press Labor and Management Conferring Day and Night</p>
<p>The strike at the Commercial Press has been ongoing for seven days since Mr. Li Bojia, specially dispatched by General Manager Wang from Hong Kong, came to Shanghai last week. The labor and management sides have negotiated twice, but no conclusion has been reached due to disagreements. The situation is now even more stagnant. It is reported that Mr. Li came to Shanghai with a plan to deal with the situation, but after arriving in Shanghai and seeing the attitude of the labor representatives, he delayed the implementation of the planned plan and had to communicate with Hong Kong again to discuss the matter and consult with the responsible persons in Shanghai day and night in order to resolve all obstacles and achieve success. According to news from the labor union, the union is determined to be consistent, take the overall situation into account, and strive for a reasonable solution. Before the management issues any policies, the union will continue to persuade all colleagues to stay at home and not act rashly. It is now known that all the steps that the union should take have been prepared, and the management will also handle the matter cautiously.</p>
<h3>Mr. Smith's Western Journey: Praises the Rapid Restoration of the Burma Road; Expresses Admiration for the Courage of the Chinese</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA held a conference at 1531 Xinzha Road the day before yesterday. Guests included Mr. and Mrs. Walker of the Salvation Army in Shanghai. During the meeting, Dr. Smith reported on his recent trip to western China. According to Dr. Smith, he was greatly surprised and admirable at the rapid restoration of the Burma Road. It is said that the courage and perseverance of the drivers speeding on the Burma Road are no less than those of the soldiers at the front line. Dr. Smith then mentioned the religious work in the interior of China, which has made considerable progress in recent years, especially the British Methodist Church.</p>
<h3>British Navy Association to Hold Naval Fundraising: To Fund Wartime Naval Expenditures</h3>
<p>In addition to donating to the "Central British War Fund," members of the British Navy Association in this port will also raise funds for the navy. It is reported that members who wish to donate to the George Naval Soldiers Fund can directly remit funds to Mr. Wilkinson, secretary of the Shanghai branch of the Navy Association. According to this naval fund, it is used to comfort wartime naval soldiers and those who perform special naval tasks, so that they can get some happiness after their hard work. According to reports, the Central British War Fund in this port donated naval comfort funds, which amounted to £7,913 by last December, and the Canadian Red Cross donated the most, totaling £13,422.</p>
<h3>Bridges Closed Twice</h3>
<p>The bridges over Suzhou Creek, from Waibaidu Bridge to Pentang Lane Bridge, were closed yesterday from 6:00 PM to 6:30 PM and from 9:00 PM to 9:30 PM. It is reported that Honda passed through the area at the above times, so the Japanese implemented special precautions to protect him.</p>
<h3>Zhang Weishan Donates to the New Pu Yu Tang</h3>
<p>Mr. Yang Yushan and others initiated a gift-giving event for Mr. Zhang Weishan's relocation. However, Mr. Zhang, considering the extraordinary times and the difficulty of resources, politely declined the many expenses of his relatives and friends. However, his relatives and friends all felt that Mr. Zhang had always been eager for public welfare, and the villagers had benefited greatly from him, and they deeply regretted that there was no opportunity to repay him. Now, on the occasion of the joy of relocation, they presented gifts to express their slight respect. Mr. Zhang firmly declined but was unable to refuse, so he converted all the gifts into cash, totaling 700 yuan, and donated it to the New Pu Yu Tang on their behalf to help with the charity. He canceled the formalities of banquets and receptions and benefited his relatives and friends.</p>
<h3>French Concession Municipal Council Completes Rice Purchase Plan: Urge Prompt Reporting of Sales Receipts for Hong Kong Rice; Rice Prices May Have a Greater Decline</h3>
<p>The food problem of the city, since the Shanghai Municipal Council and Hong Kong reached an agreement to ship rice to Shanghai for sale on the 12th, the serious atmosphere was greatly relieved, and the general public was happy. However, speculators and major hoarders were worried about the realization of the facts as scheduled, which was related to their own interests, and they were anxious to maintain prices and make a final struggle while the Hong Kong rice had not yet arrived in Shanghai and the rice shops had empty reserves. But this is only a flash in the pan, in fact, it is a sign of a final afterglow. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Urge Submission of Receipts for Hong Kong Rice Sales</p>
<p>Mr. Philip Felling, the chief of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, ordered the police departments to collect the sales receipts the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the police departments had sent police to the rice shops to collect these receipts. It is reported that some rice shops have already filled out and submitted them, and the rest of the rice shops are also rushing to fill them out. The rice shops in the Public Concession area will submit them to the Lujiawan Police Station. Once the cheap Hong Kong rice arrives in Shanghai, the legitimate rice shops will be allocated sales according to the actual sales volume and retail them to the citizens at the legal price of 110 yuan per picul. According to news from the rice industry, rice shops and grain shops have also ordered 5,000 bags of Hong Kong rice from Jardine Matheson. The remaining small rice shops are cooperating to order due to capital reasons.</p>
<p>Speculator's Struggle: Rice Prices Return to Level</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market, due to the imminent arrival of cheap Hong Kong rice, the price per picul continued to fall by four or five yuan. Later, due to the efforts of general hoarders to maintain prices, the price rose slightly. However, this is only the final struggle of the hoarders after the arrival of cheap Hong Kong rice, because the general rice speculators know that maintaining high prices is now impossible. However, they still try to take advantage of the empty reserves of the rice shops and the need to purchase more to make a final price increase. However, because cheap rice is about to arrive in Shanghai, households in this city, in addition to purchasing small amounts daily to maintain their family's needs, have stopped purchasing the current high-priced rice to avoid being exploited by rice speculators again.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Expected to Drop Sharply Today</p>
<p>The English "China Press" said that informed Chinese sources said that there may be a greater drop in prices tomorrow morning (8th). There are two reasons: 1. The Shanghai Municipal Council purchased foreign rice from Hong Kong. At the same time, 70,000 bags of Saigon rice carried by the French ship "D'Artagnan" will arrive in Shanghai, resulting in a situation of supply exceeding demand. 2. At the same time, the French Concession Municipal Council will complete its plan to transport rice from Vietnam tomorrow. The method is the same as that adopted by the Public Concession. The first batch of rice transported from Vietnam will probably arrive here within the next two weeks, and more will arrive successively in the future.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Request Sales Rights</p>
<p>The rice ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Council from Rangoon is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 12th. According to Jardine Matheson officials, the quantity is indeed 5,000 tons. After arriving in Shanghai, it will be distributed to various rice shops for retail. Therefore, the company's phone calls are very busy every day, most of which are from retail rice merchants requesting sales rights. People in the rice industry firmly believe that the first batch of foreign rice will be sold out in a few days after arriving in Shanghai because ordinary residents have now stopped buying rice and are waiting for the foreign rice ordered by the Shanghai Municipal Council to arrive.</p>
<p>Distribution Issues Have Been Decided</p>
<p>Also, the French Concession authorities have decided on the distribution of foreign rice to be transported from Saigon. It is reported that the two Concession authorities and representatives of rice merchants in the French Concession have been in contact for days. It is heard that the selling price and distribution method of foreign rice in the French Concession will be implemented with reference to the methods of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Wenzhou Telegrams Have Been Restored: Shanghai-Ningbo Traffic Can Be Relayed Through Qingpu</h3>
<p>After the recovery of Wenzhou, people from Zhejiang in Shanghai are concerned about the post-war situation there. Yesterday, according to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the various Wenzhou commercial firms in this port received telegrams directly from the Yongjia Telegraph Bureau to Shanghai to buy rice. Although it did not mention the post-war situation, it has confirmed that Shanghai and Wenzhou can officially report from yesterday. After learning the news, the Shanghai Wenzhou Association telegraphed Yongjia yesterday afternoon. Due to the congestion of communications, no reply has been received until late at night. It is also learned that a traveler from Wenzhou arrived in Shanghai yesterday. He left Yongjia after the fall of Wenzhou in the late last month and transferred to Shanghai. According to the traveler, the Japanese army's attack on Wenzhou was most intense in the area near Yuhuan, so most of the towns in Yuhuan and Wenzhou suffered heavy losses in the war. The urban area of Yongjia suffered less damage. All agencies, groups, and wealthy families had already moved, so they also suffered heavy losses. However, the local rogues, due to the pressure of livelihood, took the opportunity to rob. Almost all the major stores in Yongjia were affected, especially the national companies, whose entire stock was robbed. The remaining goods storage stacks in Songmen were also robbed. It is heard that the authorities are now pacifying the refugees and handling post-war affairs. Since the outbreak of the war in the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang, the water traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been completely interrupted. Yesterday, according to a reporter from Dagang News Agency who inquired about the traffic industry in this port, there are sailing boats coming and going between Cibei Songpu and Qingpu Town, which belongs to Songjiang County. Therefore, the traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo can be reached through the channel. In addition, there are boats traveling between An Dong in Yuyao and Zhangjiasha, but only individual passengers can travel back and forth and are not suitable for carrying luggage. However, it was found that Ningbo has not yet escaped the state of war since its fall. The Chinese troops attacked from time to time, so all traffic has not been restored.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Punished for Publishing Lottery Advertising: Fine of Thirty Shillings; Defendant Declares Disagreement</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that the local "North China Daily News" was sued by American priest Dr. Lai Jin to the British Consulate for publishing charitable lottery advertisements. Today (7th), after the British Consulate's Small Hall completed the interrogation, it sentenced the "North China Daily News" to a fine of thirty shillings. When Judge Haines read the verdict, he said that according to British law, the newspaper violated the Gambling and Lottery Act. Although the lottery was for refugee relief rather than commercial profit, it could not be an exception. He also said that although the defendant claimed that the sale of the lottery had been approved by the Chinese government in Chongqing and the authorities of the British and French Concessions, the defendant's lawyer, Jones, could not prove that the British Gambling and Lottery Act did not apply to China. British people in China are subject to British law because they enjoy consular jurisdiction. At that time, the defendant's lawyer, Jones, declared to the court that he disagreed with the original judgment and would file an appeal with the British Consulate's formal court.</p>
<h3>The Asiatic Society Exhibits Famous Diamond Models</h3>

<h3>The Accountant of the Dehe Pharmacy Was Abducted</h3>
<p>Jiang Mengyu, a 42-year-old man from Suzhou, resides at 13 Yude Lane, Yunnan Road, Public Concession. He served as a clerk in the gun license room of the Municipal Police Department before the "August 13th" Incident. Now, he is the accountant of the Dehe Pharmacy at 682 Avenue Edward VII. At 6:25 AM on the 4th of this month, Jiang was suddenly invaded at home by two Chinese and two Russians with weapons and forced to go out. His whereabouts are unknown. It was not until yesterday morning that Jiang's family reported the information to the police station and requested an investigation.</p>

In the past, those who joined the corps regarded it as a happy job, but now it is not the case. Everyone must take responsibility as a prerequisite. Payne also praised the achievements of the corps in the "B" District. It is said that the various illegal actions that have occurred in the "B" District in the past have been quickly suppressed by the corps. The police officers of the police department and the corps can cooperate seamlessly. From now on, members should pay attention to strict training.

<h3>Major Fire on Malong Road Yesterday Morning Destroys Six Silk Weaving Factories, Resulting in Eight Collapsed Buildings, Nine Deaths, and Two Injured Firefighters; Cause Attributed to Workers Cooking and the Closure of the Artesian Well</h3>
<p>At around 5 o'clock yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the Ronghua area at Lane 635, Kangti Road, Malong Road in the French Concession. Eight buildings were destroyed, most of which were small silk weaving factories. Nine men and women were burned to death, and two firefighters were injured. The losses are estimated to be over 100,000. A reporter from the Huaguang News Agency, who happened to live in the area, had a more direct account of the events. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Silk Factories in Close Proximity</p>
<p>The Ronghua area has a total of 121 commercial and residential houses. Since the January 28th Incident, many of them have been converted into small silk weaving factories. The arrangements are generally makeshift. In January of this year, a certain silk quilt factory at No. 71 and 72 in one of the lanes had a fire accident. The place is still a pile of rubble. The seven interconnected buildings from No. 11 to No. 17 in the fourth lane are all silk weaving factories. The factory owner of No. 11 to No. 13 is named Ge Mingjie, who leased the factory base of No. 11 and 12 to his nephew Ge Shiqi to run the Qicheng Silk Factory. No. 13 was leased to a Mr. Li to run the Xiesheng Silk Factory. No. 14 is the Yumao Silk Factory opened by Shen Zeqin. The factory owner of No. 15 and 16, Hu Wenlong, also leased it to the Yamei Silk Factory. No. 17 is the Yuhua Silk Factory.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Fire</p>
<p>After the electricity rationing, the factories above either stopped work or worked until midnight. However, the Xiesheng Factory owned by the Li family at No. 13 happened to be running a full night shift the previous night. As usual, the shift was to be changed at 6:00 in the morning, with the day workers taking over. At 4:45, some workers were hungry and set up a makeshift stove in a corner, using bamboo and wood scraps to cook cold rice. The flames burned through the thin wooden partition wall separating the factory from No. 14. The machine parts and silk floss in No. 14 caught fire, and the fire quickly spread to the silk threads and yarn ends under the staircase. Instantly, the fire soared upwards, bursting through the roof, and became uncontrollable. At that time, the wind direction suddenly shifted to the east and then to the west, causing the fire to spread to No. 10 (a residential house owned by the Yin family) on the west end and to No. 17 on the east end. Before the fire intensified, the neighbors tried to put it out, but since the artesian well in the area was closed by the landlords from 10:00 PM to 7:00 AM every day under the pretext of saving money, there was no water available. Although they shouted and woke up the water manager from his sleep and he started the motor, water was not available until 6:00 AM, so the fire could not be put out early.</p>
<p>Nine People Burned to Death</p>
<p>At that time, because it was just dawn, the staff and workers left in the factory had not yet gotten up. Those who woke up a little late did not have time to escape. The factory owner of No. 12, Ge Shiqi, upon hearing the alarm, rushed from his residence (also in the area) with his wife Zhou, concubine Zhao, child Minzhong, and daughter Fengying to the factory. Unexpectedly, all five members of his family were burned to death. At No. 13, the wife and two female workers (Zhang Baoying and Ms. Lü) and one male worker of the factory owner Mr. Li died, totaling nine deaths.</p>
<p>Firefighters Injured</p>
<p>Upon receiving the news, the fire brigade of the French Concession fully mobilized. At around 5:15, fire trucks arrived at the scene one after another and worked hard to extinguish the fire. However, due to the misty rain and unpredictable wind direction, it took two and a half hours to put out the fire. Firefighter No. 25 of the Songshan Road Fire Brigade was severely injured by pressure and was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses</p>
<p>It is said that the fire caused severe losses. The value of the equipment and raw materials of the five silk factories alone is said to be over 100,000. Although each had fire insurance, the total amount was less than half of the loss. Moreover, during the fire fighting, dozens of fire trucks, police ambulances, and official vehicles were parked on Malong Road, causing the original shops and small vegetable markets on the road to close and unable to operate. This was an unexpected loss.</p>
<h3>An Old Clerk of a Customs Brokerage Firm Secretly Steals Warehouse Receipts and Fraudulently Withdraws Twenty Pieces of Cloth</h3>
<p>The Shen Zhuang branch of Qianxiangyi Cloth Store at No. 2, Lane 327, Ningbo Road is opened by the wealthy Lu province native You Jumen and managed by Liu Zisheng. Recently, the store entrusted fifty pieces of cloth, each containing forty bolts, to Tongfa Public Customs Brokerage Firm at No. 78, Tianzhutang Street, French Concession, for storage at Heap 7 of the British-owned Pingzhiming Warehouse on Ningbo Road. At that time, the warehouse issued a warehouse receipt and a goods withdrawal booklet. In the future, if Qianxiangyi needed to withdraw goods, they only needed to issue a withdrawal slip stating the quantity of goods, affix a seal, and the warehouse would deliver the goods accordingly. However, Qianxiangyi recently discovered that a page was missing from the withdrawal booklet, so they inquired with Pingzhiming and learned that twenty pieces of stored cloth had been fraudulently withdrawn, with a value of approximately 20,800 yuan. They reported this to the Laozha Police Station, and detective Cao Qishan investigated and determined that Hu Guibin, an old clerk from Tongfa Public Customs Brokerage Firm and a native of Ningbo, was highly suspected. Because Hu was very familiar with Qianxiangyi, he could enter and leave the accounting room without any hindrance. He was arrested and sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested permission for a detention order for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng, an order was issued for detention pending further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Merchants Are as Ferocious as Tigers and Wolves; The Price of Rice Therefore Falls and Rises Again; The Psychology of Suspicion Is Still Secretly Undermining; Unbeknownst to Them, the Shanghai Municipal Council Has Established a Policy That Is Difficult to Shake</h3>
<p>The price of foreign rice initially fell yesterday and then rose again. Although the market seems to have entered a phase of fluctuation, the price has already fallen by twenty-three to five yuan compared to the highest price due to the continuous sharp declines. After the drop, genuine consumers and retail buyers seized the opportunity to buy at lower prices. However, those holding the goods are still reluctant to sell, still struggling to maintain prices, resulting in this phenomenon of a large drop followed by a small rebound. If the contracted rice arrives, the sale of Hong Kong rice at flat prices will soon be realized. Vietnamese rice will continue to arrive, customer sales will stagnate, local reserves are limited, and after the market returns to normal, such a high price will naturally not be sustainable. Even if rice merchants struggle to support it, it may not last. Therefore, the future price of rice still needs to continue to fall.</p>
<p>The rice merchants' psychology is still as ferocious as tigers and wolves. This is why the price of rice fell and rose again yesterday. Rice merchants have three types of psychology:</p>
<p>First, they believe that the Municipal Council's fixed price sale of rice is limited to the current 50,000 bags and will not continue thereafter. Therefore, they regard the Municipal Council's move as an "air action" to flatten the current price of rice. As a result, they want to wait for their "psychology of suspicion" to be confirmed. Then, the price of rice will not only be 160 yuan but can surge again and again, to above 200 yuan. The rice hoarders can then do whatever they want. The origin of this psychology of the rice merchants probably stems from the fact that the price limits set by the Municipal Council on previous occasions have been broken by the rice merchants one by one, and have frequently exceeded the limits and gone up. The Municipal Council could do nothing about it. Therefore, they believe that the Municipal Council's monthly shipment and sale of large quantities of Hong Kong rice to meet the food needs of all citizens in Shanghai is not only unsustainable but also impossible. The rice merchants like to create rumors and release hot air, so they also assume that the Municipal Council's shipment of Hong Kong rice to supply the Shanghai people also contains a factor of "air action." They do not know that the Municipal Council is the municipal authority within the Public Concession. Every action of the municipal authority must be based on its established policy and will never be like the previous price limits, mistakenly recognizing the rice hoarders as "legitimate rice businesses" without interference, which would put millions of citizens at risk of starvation. Now that they have changed their approach and cooperated with the Hong Kong government to relieve the food shortage in Shanghai, they will never make empty threats and stop at the first batch of 50,000 bags. Nor will they change the policy of selling rice at flat prices due to the rice merchants' passive resistance. If it is as the rice merchants speculate, how will they gain the trust of millions of people in Shanghai? Therefore, this kind of psychology of the rice merchants only shows that they are greedy, malicious, and ruthless, only caring about making a fortune for themselves and putting millions of people in a desperate situation, and have the malicious intention of despising and destroying the Municipal Council's orders.</p>
<p>Second, the rice merchants believe that Japan will inevitably invade the south. Once they invade the south, Hong Kong's position will be shaken. Then, even if there is a grain supply agreement between Hong Kong and Shanghai, it cannot be fulfilled in fact. Then, the rice that is hoarded today will be as precious as pearls and jewels. At that time, there will be no fair price and the rice merchants can be as predatory as they wish. No one will dare to do anything about it. The above two are the major reasons for the rumors that caused the price of rice to fall and rise again yesterday.</p>
<p>Third, the rice merchants publicly claim that if they sell the rice of the Municipal Council, how will they sell the high-priced rice they have accumulated? This statement is not unpleasant, but in fact, it is exactly the opposite. It is found that there are currently about two million bags of rice stored in Shanghai. The cost of each bag is at most just over one hundred yuan. Therefore, when the rice merchants raised the price to the highest level, they earned no less than 70, 60, or at least 40 or 50 yuan per bag. The profit is so huge that no other business can match it. "Unheard of in ancient times, unprecedented in the world," is the saying for the recent rice market in Shanghai. Even though it has fallen for three consecutive days recently (the market rebounded again yesterday), the rice merchants' profit per bag is still at least between 30, 40, and 50 yuan. The profit is still substantial. Even if the future price of rice is the same as the price set by the Municipal Council, the rice merchants will not lose money. Or some say that the rice that has recently been contracted is already high in price. In fact, the contracted amount is limited. Even if the price is high, it is all because the rice merchants have raised the price of local rice too high, which has made foreign merchants greedy and also raised the contract price. This is also the evil result created by the rice merchants themselves, so what is the blame on the public? The Municipal Council is not involved.</p>
<p>In short, the rice merchants must respect the position and intentions of the Municipal Council. What's more, today the Municipal Council is trying to save millions of people from the tiger and wolf mouths of the hoarders and rice weevils. And since the Municipal Council has already taken this action, there is no reason to abandon it halfway. Even if there are any accidents, they must have been deeply considered and planned for by the Municipal Council. Unlike the rice merchants who only care about killing people, do not know how to create blessings for their children and grandchildren, and do not know how to leave a way out for themselves. They are still not aware of it and are still dreaming of reversing the situation and clinging to their evil ways. How can these treacherous merchants still consider themselves human beings? Otherwise, why would they be so cruel to their fellow human beings?</p>
<p>In the early morning market, following the strong selling trend of the previous day, the price of various foreign rice fell again by two, three, or five yuan. In particular, the price of Xiaowen rice fell the most sharply, to as low as 125 yuan. Mixed broken rice was the lowest at 105 yuan. Other rice prices did not follow suit to the same extent. For example, the current price of Yinghuasi's original package Xiaojiao rice was 156 yuan, and the price for April-May delivery was only 153-154 yuan. Saigon No. 1 was 159 yuan, broken rice was 122.5 to 123 yuan, all of which were 2-3 yuan lower than the previous day. Subsequently, the hoarders, with ill intentions, deliberately spread rumors favorable to the buyers. The market price rebounded by two or three yuan, attempting to shake confidence in the Municipal Council. However, after the rise, a large number of sellers emerged, and the closing price still fell by one or two yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 8,000 bags of current rice and 1,000 tons of original package rice. The price of Saigon No. 1 was 138 to 136 yuan, Mindangbai was 130 to 128 yuan, Xiaojiao was 130 to 129 yuan, and broken tip was 106-107 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales of thick and thin japonica rice, domestic rice, are still sluggish. Moreover, the customers cherish it and are still rejecting it. Therefore, in the end, only 30 to 50 shi of early and late rice were traded, with a price of 136-137 yuan, which was 5-6 yuan lower than the previous day. Thick japonica rice still lacks transactions. As for glutinous rice, the market is scarce and it is also subject to the constraints of other goods. Therefore, it is also difficult to maintain. The opening price of Hong Kong white rice was only 125-126 yuan, and glutinous green rice was 116-117 yuan, a sharp drop of 6-7 yuan. The total transaction volume was also very limited.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continued to arrive at the port. The French company's Datannan postal ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, bringing 1,350 bags of foreign rice from Saigon. In addition, a large batch of 58,000 bags of corn was also shipped from Saigon and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou for unloading. (Zu)</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Remains Weak</h3>
<p>Flour: The current market situation of foreign flour. When the market opened in the morning, it was still affected by the sharp drop in foreign rice. People's hearts were depressed. The price of Jinlong brand Kan flour fell from 32.45 yuan to 32 yuan, which aroused the interest of genuine consumers. About 6,000 bags were traded, with a price of 32.23 yuan. The price of Huawu brand Australian flour was 33 yuan, with no buyers. However, the overall market situation is relatively stable. Because the price of rice has gradually stopped falling, and it is rumored that the Australian flour shipped to Shanghai has been turned back halfway, the future supply may not be abundant. Therefore, the market may rebound. The Fuxin factory still supplied more than 5,000 bags of flat-price flour, and a total of 8,318 bags of foreign flour were extracted, with the price still at 29 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market situation has also eased slightly. Because the price of flour shipped to Japan has fallen, people's hearts are depressed. Various flour mills have not formally collected raw materials for a long time. The Nikkei market's purchase of goods has also stopped in an invisible way. It is said that the price of wheat stored in the local warehouse in the Concession is 47-48 yuan, and there are no buyers for the time being. Therefore, the market is as quiet as usual.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Corn Plunges Sharply, Then Rebounds in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the miscellaneous grains and oil cakes market was weak in the first half of the day. This was because the price of rice only fell and did not rise, people's hearts were timid, scalpers disappeared, and the market atmosphere was all the way down. Except for peanut oil, which was stable, soybean oil fell by two yuan, soybeans fell by four or five jiao, corn plunged by about two yuan, and soybean cake fell by five or six jiao. Transactions were scarce. In the afternoon, the rice market was driven by rumors and became tense again. Soybean cake and corn, under consistent manipulation, showed a rebound. It is estimated that corn rose by one yuan five or six jiao compared to the morning market. The opening price of Saigon new corn was 35 yuan to 36.5 yuan, and the old corn was 33.5 yuan to 34.7 yuan. The price for April delivery was 68 yuan. Dutch white corn was 34.6 yuan to 36 yuan. The current price of Yinghuasi was 66 yuan, 65.5 yuan, and the price for April-May delivery was 66.05 yuan. The price of yellow corn was 34.6 yuan. The current price of Yinghuasi was 68 yuan. Only the Shenji futures of soybean cake were opened. The market went from falling to rising, and it rose by two jiao compared to the previous day's market. The price for delivery in the first half of May was 21.1 yuan to 1.8 yuan, the price for delivery in the second half of May was 21.4 yuan to 22.2 yuan, and the price for delivery in the first half of June was 22.5 yuan to 23.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous grains and sesame were exported on the 8th, with 1,145 bags of soybeans shipped to Singapore, 100 bags of sesame shipped to Hong Kong, 200 tins of sesame oil, and 150 bags of sorghum shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Settles Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Foreign Exchange: Yesterday's market situation. HSBC's posted rates were changed. The dark market of British and American exchange rates first loosened and then suddenly returned to flat. Because Hong Kong's telegrams were delayed and then suddenly ten thousand U.S. dollars were received. It was also heard that a huge amount of foreign rice was settled.

<h3>The Gold Market Wanted to Fall, But Stopped Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market, the price of gold suddenly turned hard in the black market, first falling and then suddenly rising. The hearts of all parties have already turned towards prosperity. The U.S. exchange rate of five yuan two five had been reached, as seen in the upper range, and then the importers, rice foreign firms, and Hong Kong power firms took action by switching from sales to pull, so it came back from loose to flat. Therefore, after the morning opening, it retreated to 6,617 yuan. Soon after, the securities firms, gold firms, and exchange firms started to cover their short positions. It was also heard that the Shanghai West firms sold current yarn and came to enter and cover short positions, so it rose even more sharply at noon, clamoring to a high price of 6,657 yuan. Finally, it saw a rebound of nine yuan. The total transaction volume for half a day was about 20,000 taels. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. The black market price was very flat.

There was still no price or market for the current marked gold.</p>
<h3>Securities: There is Little Excitement in Domestic Bonds</h3>
<p>Government bonds, the black market situation yesterday, again tended to be very dull. The day before yesterday, there was a slight turnaround, but it was still because the big players were unable to pull it up, and instead there was selling and it tended to be revolving and weak, brewing. There was not much change in the situation, and the bulls were tired of the weakness of the market price for a long time, and the interest they had to bear was very large, so they were frustrated as soon as they rose slightly. The lack of spirit and leisure on the stage was the most evident in yesterday afternoon's market. In the morning, because Xiexing Yuan and Hongshi bought in, Class C once rose by two jiao. After entering, the 90% and Tongkang bulls slightly released, but then it turned soft again. In the afternoon, the trading volume was extremely small, and Class B failed to open. The remaining types were only one or two market points. The market price was slightly weak again, and the situation was that as soon as the bulls raised the price by one or two jiao, there were sellers. Fortunately, the sellers were not eager to sell, otherwise it would have fallen a lot. As a result, Class C and E rose and fell, only by five fen. The remaining three types did not see any ups and downs at all. The transaction volume for the whole day was only 400 to 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Shareholder transactions, 88 shares of Hengli Bank were traded, with a price of 6.85 yuan. The face value of each share is only 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Divergent Views Between Bulls and Bears, The Yarn Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned from low to high, but the trend is still fluctuating. This is because both bulls and bears have wills, and their views are very different. The buyers said that the Shuangma warehouse receipts are dry and they look forward to the price increase. As for the sellers, the price of miscellaneous brand yarn is too cheap, and the distance from Shuangma is shocking. Therefore, the general speculators enter and exit from time to time, which is very lively. The customer side, real sales still wholesale purchase, but sporadic transactions continue without interruption. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,562 yuan, the low price was 1,544 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,565 yuan, falling to 1,563 yuan, and then to 1,564-5 yuan. The final price was 1,561-2 yuan. Today, 670 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Shuangma market opened in the morning, and the trend was still tight. Because overseas American cotton continued to be firm, some speculators were active. The opening price was 1,553 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers rushed in, rising to 1,559 yuan in an instant. However, the securities firms continued to sell in huge quantities, and at the same time, the gold price opened looser. After a while, it fell back to 1,544 yuan. At this time, a group of bulls moved in to drag in and add weight, recovering to more than 1,550 yuan. However, the 40-count thread price upstairs was downward, a certain standard was not strong, so the pressure rice loosened, and it revolved for a long time at the edge of 50 yuan. Afterwards, bull rumors arose again, transferring the factory to collect 300 packs of warehouse receipts. At the same time, the mark gold turned expensive, and for a while the noise in the market was great, and it rose to 1,562 yuan in succession. The closing price was 1,561 yuan. The total transaction volume during the half day was 10,790 packs. The amount of each bank purchased is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 790 Same industry 10,000</p>
<p>Total 10,790</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rises Again and Again, There is Lively Trade in Fine Velvet</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is slightly better. Although the factory needs are not smooth, people's hearts have improved. However, most of the transactions are in fine velvet raw materials, so the price has risen by four or five yuan compared to before. The trade in coarse velvet is still as sparse as before, and the price has risen by one or two yuan. A total of 1,446 pieces were completed yesterday.</p>
<p>Dazhongji 313 Xinyu 300 pieces were sent to the factory</p>
<p>Meipengjiapo 310 Another 100 pieces also</p>
<p>Brazilian cotton 400 Shunfeng 126 pieces for warehouse delivery</p>

<p>Dafeng wooden frame 310 Renchang 75 pieces also</p>
<p>Lankong cotton 214 Shenghe 100 pieces also</p>
<p>Another message Shanghai foreign firm foreign cotton trade. Although people's hearts are excited because American cotton is rising again and again, but based on the mediocre yarn market, and there are still many inventories in the city, and the factory's appetite is not smooth, the purchase of peers yesterday was slightly lively, and the market price also rose by one or two yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Large Quantities of Factory Cloth Shipped to Singapore and Siam</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday morning the market initially fell, but recovered in the afternoon, with the trend turning stable. Sales of white goods in the morning fell by 1.5 to 5 jiao per piece, with a partial rebound in the afternoon (of 2.5 jiao per piece).

<h3>Sugar Market: Raw White Initially Falls, Then Rises</h3>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council: Special Education Committee Issues Report (1) - Discussion of Policy Guidelines, Narrative of Task Process</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Special Education Committee, established in October of last year, has held multiple meetings to discuss the Bureau's educational policy guidelines. It has recently submitted a report to the Bureau. The full text of the report is quite lengthy. Before discussion by the Board of Directors, it was also sent to the Bureau's Standing Education Committee to record their opinions. The main points are translated below:</p>
<p>Committee's Mission</p>
<p>The mission of this committee is: (1) To study the organization of the Municipal Council's Education Department and Bureau-run schools to determine if expenses can be reduced and efficiency increased, and to review the methods for allocating subsidies; (2) To review the Bureau's current education policy, consider whether it should be changed, and refer to the recommendations made by the Special Education Committee in April 1937, but without being bound by them. According to the aforementioned recommendations, the Municipal Council's education policy should trend towards expanding the subsidy system, increasing the establishment of foreign expatriate schools, and relaxing the restrictions on allocating educational funding from municipal revenue.</p>
<p>Director-General's Speech</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Director-General and CEO, Mr. Fessenden, gave a speech at the beginning of this committee's establishment. He stated that the Board of Directors has differing opinions regarding the Bureau's general education policy. Some Board members believe that the Bureau should immediately cease operating Bureau-run schools, making the Bureau solely a revenue-collecting agency, allocating a portion of the taxes paid by various national residents to their respective resident groups for educational funding. At the same time, other Board members believe that this type of change would not only fail to improve efficiency but would also be uneconomical. Fessenden continued by mentioning the report on foreign expatriate schools submitted by the Special Education Committee established in 1927. The recommendations in this report were shelved at the time, awaiting the submission of a report from another special committee on Chinese schools, before being reviewed. However, the outbreak of the Shanghai War prevented the establishment of the aforementioned committee. The Bureau is now willing to re-examine the recommendations made by the 1937 committee. Fessenden concluded by stating, "I now ask your committee to consider the Bureau's educational organization in order to explore the possibility of increasing the efficiency of educational administration and reducing expenses, as the Economics Committee is doing with other Bureau organizations."</p>
<p>Work Discussion</p>
<p>This committee held its first meeting on November 1st of last year. As of the end of April this year, it has held a total of fifteen meetings. The Director of Education and various departments of finance have provided numerous important materials and forms.

<h3>Shanghai Art Community Initiates Art Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai art community has recently lacked connection. Now, famous painters such as Jiang Ren, Zhou Bichu, Zhang Chongren, Hu Jinren, Ding Guangxie, Tang Yunyu, Huang Zongmo, and Huang Jue Temple, etc., initiated the Shanghai Art Society on May 5th at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Huang Jue Temple presided. It was decided to plan for a meeting location, hold a permanent exhibition hall and painter's club, etc., to facilitate connection and mutual study. Currently, they are actively seeking a meeting location and recruiting members. Once established, Shanghai artists will have a place for frequent gatherings and can effectively promote art. It is heard that various individuals are actively involved, and many members have agreed to join.</p>
<h3>Recruitment of Editorial Talent</h3>
<p>The Renlou Longwen Bookstore of the Shanghai Salt Industry Bank has been working hard on social investigation in recent years. It has a unique approach to the cultural sphere in the country, but deeply feels the lack of talent suitable for this work. It has widely recruited, but few are willing to carefully pursue practical matters. Recently, the store is widely entrusting various vocational guidance agencies to recruit assistant editors and investigators. Those with a foundation in Chinese and English and who are willing to work hard are especially welcome. The compensation is said to be generous.</p>

<h3>How to Choose Books (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Liangsheng</p>
<p>3. On the Cultivation of Sentiment: In addition to knowledge and will, emotions are also very important in people's lives. For example, when we read, we cannot always read books on self-cultivation, deliberately seeking the principles of conduct and methods of dealing with people, nor can we rigidly read only books on science, deliberately pursuing the increase of knowledge and ability. Sometimes we should read poetry and novels to cultivate our sentiments. These types of books have a greater power to move people than books on self-cultivation and knowledge enhancement. Therefore, the selection of such books should have appropriate standards. If one makes a mistake, it will not only be a waste of effort and time but also harm the body and mind, with a substantial impact.</p>
<p>(1) Proper Content: When choosing books on cultivating sentiment, one must pay attention to whether their content is proper. Not all books that suit our interests are beneficial. This is like a poisonous drug wrapped in sugar. It tastes sweet at first, but will eventually harm our intestines.</p>
<p>(2) Profound Description: When choosing books on cultivating sentiment, one should not only pay attention to whether their content is proper but also to whether their descriptions are profound. If the content of a book has profound descriptions, we will be able to evoke our sentiments when we read it.</p>
<p>(3) Deep and Lengthy Meaning: The meaning between the lines is deep and lengthy, capable of causing deep reflection. Modern humorous essays are not only artistic in writing but also have implications beyond the words, with inexhaustible implications. We can cultivate our sentiments by understanding the truth within them.</p>
<p>4. On the Training of Thought: Humans cannot but seek knowledge. Besides reading, there are other more important things to do. However, seeking knowledge requires the training of thought. Thought training does not necessarily rely solely on reading. However, frequently reading books that train thought can greatly help us in thought training. What standards should we use to choose books for training thought?</p>
<p>(1) Able to Inspire Thought: General books can inspire our thoughts. However, if we want to have the ability to analyze or synthesize, then among the general books, we should choose those that are more capable of stimulating our thoughts.</p>
<p>(2) Able to Solve Problems: In addition to paying attention to stimulating our thoughts, when choosing books for training our thoughts, we must also pay attention to whether this book or that book can solve problems. Because books that solve problems can also train our thoughts.</p>
<p>(3) Verifiable through Experimentation: When choosing books for training thought, one must also pay attention to whether it can be verified through experimentation. By frequently choosing to read books that are verifiable through experimentation, our thinking will also become scientific. Westerners, in order to invent a theory, do not hesitate to sacrifice their entire lives to seek evidence, and only dare to be confident after tens, hundreds, or thousands of pieces of evidence are the same. Some books, however, may have theories that are not very accurate. Reading them may lead our thoughts astray. Therefore, we must pay special attention to this point when choosing books on training thought. (The End)</p>

<h3>Incentivizing Childbirth</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>In recent years, several totalitarian states have "incentivized childbirth," sparing no effort.</p>
<p>They award certificates to large families with dense populations, provide loans to young people unable to marry, and levy heavy taxes on bachelors who "refuse to marry at a great age," employing all possible forms of coercion and inducement. However, their purpose is simply to create more potential cannon fodder.</p>
<p>An American reporter expressed doubt about whether "childbirth" needs "incentivizing."</p>
<p>He said that the American government does not incentivize childbirth, but parents have not stopped giving birth because the government does not incentivize it, and the population has not decreased as a result. According to the national population survey statistics from 1930 to 1940, the "output" of children in the United States in 1940 exceeded any other year.</p>
<p>He believes that rather than using coercive and inducive measures to incentivize childbirth, it is better to give the people a humane government. Allow the people to have freedom of life, to live and work in peace and contentment, with few worries, ample food and clothing, and freedom from the terror of unnecessary wars of aggression. In this way, the government does not have to fear that the people will stop giving birth. Under such a government, childbirth does not need incentivizing.</p>
<p>These words are worth pondering.</p>

<h3>The Calamity of London's Children</h3>
<p>— Wen He</p>
<p>The large-scale bombing of London is astonishing, but the calamity suffered by London's children goes beyond just bombs.</p>
<p>London's compulsory education system has almost ground to a halt. Half of the city's schools have closed due to bombing damage or requisition by the state for other purposes. There are still 365 schools open, but teaching hours have been reduced. When an air raid alarm sounds, teachers can only announce the end of class.</p>
<p>Another serious phenomenon is the increase in truancy. London has 80,000 school-age children between the ages of five and fourteen, but only 26,000 attend school daily. Although officials send people to students' homes to urge them to attend class, the effect is minimal. Many parents are afraid to let their children go to school out of concern for their safety. In fact, some children are being sent by their parents to do petty trading or begging on the streets. Other children are simply loitering outside.</p>
<p>Another reason parents do not let their children go to school is that bomb shelter spaces need to be watched over to avoid last-minute scrambles. Every morning at nine o'clock, the children take bedding to the underground stations to find suitable spaces for the whole family. After finding them, they watch over the spaces underground. One child said: "Go to school? I have to watch the space, don't I? Mom went home, she has things to do, she told me to watch the space for her."</p>
<p>The air in the underground is turbid, and the light and warmth are insufficient. There are also few toilets. Living underground often poses a problem for health. Although doctors and nurses often inspect, their numbers are insufficient. One doctor works at a children's hospital during the day, and at night he also has to go to the bomb shelters, where he has to care for five thousand men, women, and children alone.</p>
<p>The government is urging people to move children out of London, with lengthy articles in the newspapers, as well as distributing leaflets and sending 600 personnel to visit homes and persuade parents to move their children elsewhere. Although they have spoken until their lips are parched, most people do not pay attention. Most children have not been moved out. Therefore, the Director of Education, Mr. Lansbury, later said, "Forcing the relocation of school-age children is impossible, either politically or socially."</p>

<h3>Reason to Not Fear Great-Aunt</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>In the May 1st edition of this column, Su Caojun's "A Daughter-in-Law's Difficulties" was published, prompting the following thoughts:</p>
<p>Su Caojun compares private schools to large families; the principal, parents, teachers, colleagues, introducers, and students... to grandmothers, great-grandmothers, great-grandfathers, daughters-in-law, sisters-in-law, cousins, husbands, and children... This seems to reflect part of reality. At the same time, the pain he suffered certainly made me very sympathetic. However, I believe that being a teacher in this kind of environment, although difficult, is not absolutely impossible. As the saying goes, "If you're in the right, you don't need to fear the great-aunt." It is clear that as long as you can implement teaching based on educational principles, child psychology, and with all your heart, all external troubles will be solved. Even if you take a few steps back, if you can work hard without violating the principal's intentions, and enable students to benefit from it, not only will the principal look at you differently, but the parents will also develop a good impression of you. (Because it is inevitable that the principal wants the school to have a good reputation and that the parents want their children to improve.) If this can be achieved, then generally speaking, sisters-in-law, cousins, and colleagues, even if they want to create trouble, will have no way to start. Introducers and husbands, although they have no power, it doesn't matter. It should be known that schools are not families after all, and teachers are not daughters-in-law. Even a daughter-in-law can "not fear the great-aunt if she is in the right," let alone a teacher who leads a group and is responsible for changing customs!</p>
<p>These are some of my shallow and foolish opinions. I ask for your wise opinion, what do you think?</p>
<h3>Strike Down Those Who Hoard</h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>Filling Hunger with Rocks</h3>
<p>— Jin Chun</p>
<p>Scientists in Kansas, USA, have recently invented an economical and practical method of feeding livestock, which is to use limestone powder instead of the hay previously used. A group of farmers are all adopting it, because not only is the cost low, which can generate thicker profit, but also the cattle fed with this "food" are said to be sturdier than those usually fed with hay. Originally, livestock feed needs to have a considerable amount of calcium, and the calcium content of limestone powder is abundant. According to recent experiments by scientists, it is no less than that of ordinary hay.</p>
<p>When scientists were experimenting with limestone powder, it was initially because the land in Kansas was barren and there was a lack of hay. They thought that calcium supplements the body, so they mixed it with other substances and fed it to cattle. Later, they saw that it was also very good to use limestone powder alone, so they specialized in using limestone powder. Now, the experimental results show that one pound of limestone powder can feed a cow for ten days. Previously, it cost four dollars for hay. Now, by replacing it with limestone powder, it only costs twenty cents.</p>
<p>In addition to researching new cattle feed, scientists in Kansas are now also researching making grass into food for human consumption. It is said that the vitamin content in this food is particularly rich.</p>
<p>Inventions like these are not limited to a group of scientists in the United States. It is said that German scientists are making wood bread and have already made a kind of "meat" that is completely extracted from wood. Of course, it can be eaten, but the taste may not be very good.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>

<p>(7) A Cross Scratched on His Face</p>
<p>But as soon as his eyes met Qiu Haitang's, the money-hungry man could not help but shudder. The eyes of this young man in his twenties were already filled with anger, resentment, and a desperate emotion that people who saw it could never forget. Like the wronged ghosts we see in old novels, it would plant a terror in your heart, making you forever see this pair of eyes in your hallucinations.</p>
<p>The door opened, and someone came in, but not Yuan Shaowen, whom Qiu Haitang was hoping for, but the heartless Ji Zhaoxiong, holding a bayonet commonly used on rifles, flashing with dazzling light.</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang knew that all hope was lost.</p>
<p>"Ah! Don't do this...you...! Don't...treat me like this...!" He tried his best to spit out the thing stuffed in his mouth, shouting desperately. Before Ji Zhaoxiong's knife could stab his face, he had already lost consciousness.</p>
<p>When Yuan Shaowen, covered in sweat, dragged Governor Hu with him, Qiu Haitang's body was already lying stiff on the ground, his face stained like a blood ball, one of his eyes was pierced by the tip of the knife, and it no longer resembled a human face at all.</p>
<p>"Who did this?" Shaowen raised his head, glaring at everyone in the yard, his hair almost standing on end.</p>
<p>No one dared to answer.</p>
<p>"Who did this? I'm going to fight him!" He stood directly in front of Yuan Bao Pan, less than half a foot away, his blood-red eyes fixed on the old Yuan's face. He had completely denied that he was his uncle. (100)</p>

<h3>Single-Wheel Ambulance Stretcher</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>The stretchers and elevating beds used by ambulance teams usually require two team members to lift them, rescuing only one injured person at a time, which is uneconomical. To address this deficiency, a single-wheel ambulance stretcher has recently been developed. It allows one person to rescue one injured person, and it is also faster than using an elevating bed. The method involves fitting a bicycle wheel under the stretcher frame, greatly increasing the convenience of rescue work in bombed areas.</p>

<h3>From Yan Jupeng's Conversation to Losing Street, Empty City, and Executing Ma Su</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>In the Laosheng (old male role) line of Peking Opera, since Jiaotian (Wang Xiaonong) became famous for his Tan (Xinpei) style, for decades, whether directly or indirectly, those who speak of his school mostly follow Tan as their basis, but with variations and invariances. Those who vary, like Yu (Shuyan) and Ma (Lianliang), can certainly establish their own schools; those who do not vary, like Guan (Zhongxiang) and Fu Ying, can also diligently maintain the tradition. As for Yan Jupeng, he is in between variation and invariance. Compared to those mentioned above who vary or do not vary, he can also be called a successor of the Tan school.</p>
<p>In recent years, Jupeng has performed in various cities, and among his repertoire, "Losing Street, Empty City, and Executing Ma Su" is the most frequent. This play was Tan Xinpei's most satisfying work. His gestures, expressions, stage movements, and singing were all perfectly in line with the status of Marquis Wu (Zhuge Liang) at that time. When performed by contemporary actors, they either resemble Zhang Liang and Liu Ji or are merely like strategists and advisors. This play cannot be performed without a refined and scholarly air, without a solemn bearing, and without a vigorous spirit. Lacking any of these, even if the singing is pleasant to hear and the acting is lifelike, it is still mere imitation and cannot avoid superficiality. I have heard from old opera connoisseurs that there are several aspects of Tan Xinpei's performance that are very difficult to learn, such as: the Xipi Yuanban (a type of aria) sung after sitting in the tent and instructing Ma Su, conveying a sincere and cautious attitude; the nervous expression after hearing the three reports, the line "Sima Yi's large army is coming so quickly!" in the spoken part, and the lines "I have been cautious in using troops for decades" in the Yaoban (another type of aria), depicting a transition from surprise to regret, from hope to hatred, all conveyed vividly without stiffness. Also, the leisurely manner in the Manban (slow tempo) section "I was originally," with its repeated sighs, reveals Zhuge Liang's unwavering loyalty to the late Emperor's earnest invitation even in times of military crisis. Furthermore, the Erliu (a type of aria) section is beautiful but difficult to sing; too slow and it becomes flat, too fast and it becomes vulgar. In this part, Tan Xinpei had the appearance of "remaining calm even when Mount Tai collapses before him." Moreover, the solemn air of approaching the stage to execute Ma Su, and the Allegro section, rapid but not rushed, angry but not resentful, convey a full of grief and indignation completely in the line "Flog Wang Ping forty strokes," which can make the audience's emotions be tense and is particularly difficult to learn. Contemporary actors neglect this line and instead seek attention with contrived and affected crying, which is a great mistake! Since Jupeng has profound attainments in Tan's operas, he should be able to understand this play quite well. Could it be that he has achieved a refined and vigorous spirit? After all, he has studied Tan diligently for decades, so perhaps he will not be as superficial as contemporary actors.</p>
<h3>Records of Colorful Dramatic Arts</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun's debut film "Same Fate as Mandarin Ducks," which they produced and starred in, has been scheduled to begin filming at the Guolian Xinhua Studio in early next month. Zhang Zhizhi, You Guangzhao, and others will be invited to make cameo appearances. The script is said to be written by Wang Yin himself, and the plot is quite tight. The estimated production cost is forty-five thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Jin Yan recently accepted an invitation from the China Film Studio in Chongqing and will take Wang Renmei back to Chongqing by plane within the month. It is said that the China Film Studio has decided to have them star in "Marching Song" and "New Song of Eternal Sorrow," respectively. The directors of these two films have been internally decided as Cheng Bugao and Yuan Zongliu, with Gu Erji as assistant director for the latter.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Chen Yunshang, Li Qinian, and others will return to Hong Kong in the near future, but due to contract relationships with companies in Shanghai, they have decided not to film any more movies in Hong Kong. Therefore, they are expected to return to Shanghai to work within a month.</p>
<p>The China Touring Drama Troupe has signed a long-term contract for daytime performances with the Carlton Theatre. If Yan Jupeng discontinues his performances and Zhou Xinfang has no intention of performing either, they will continue to sign a contract for nighttime performances. It is said that the current daytime rental fee is more than three times lower than that of the Lyceum Theatre, so Tang Huaiqiu is now at ease and actively rehearsing three new scripts, which will be performed one after another after "Hong Xuanjiao."</p>
<p>Since Lan Qing joined the Green Treasure Theater, she has been well-received by many audiences because of her fluent Mandarin and beautiful expressions. It is learned that the Green Treasure authorities have decided to increase Lan Qing's salary by one hundred yuan starting from the first day of next month to reward outstanding talent.</p>
<p>Jin Xing's new film "Chronicles of an Isolated Island" is more than halfway through filming. It is said that the plot satirizes the general romantic youths on the isolated island. The film is expected to be completed by the end of next month, and it is also said that the premiere rights have already belonged to "Jin Du."</p>
<p>"Widow in the Wind" has been a great box office success at the Shanghai Theater, so director Li Pingqian has been quite pleased recently. According to Li, he plans to continue the style of the film and invite Li Qinian to star in another film, with some of the original cast and crew assisting in the production. Ye Yifang will continue to serve as the screenwriter.</p>
<p>After "Home," the Shanghai Drama Society has selected "Striving for Strength" as its next production. However, due to a dispute among a few members, it was forced to temporarily announce the suspension of the performance. It is now scheduled to premiere "Mandarin Duck Robbery" and "Seeking Pleasure" on the 9th. It is said that the scripts to be performed after these two plays include "Lying World," "Song of Righteousness," and "Between Love and Hate."</p>
<p>Ernest Hemingway, the new American writer who recently traveled and investigated in Chongqing, will have his works adapted into films by Paramount. His powerful work "For Whom the Bell Tolls," which depicts the Spanish Civil War, has been cast with Ingrid Bergman. She is a Swedish actress, and Gary Cooper is the most likely to be chosen as the male lead.</p>
<h3>Jade Flowers in the Blood Rain</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Falling Flowers Intentionally Follow the Flowing Water</p>
<p>Walking along winding paths to a small pavilion, Xu Jing saw Lady He standing gracefully, welcoming him with a smile. Xu Jing hurriedly bowed. Lady He invited him to sit down, and a maid served fragrant tea. Although Xu Jing was sitting, he felt uneasy. Lady He talked and laughed naturally, her beautiful eyes gleaming, asking Xu Jing about the customs and conditions of the county. Xu Jing answered respectfully. Lady He frequently sent him glances of amorous intent, and gave him fleeting smiles. Xu Jing felt a passionate warmth emanating from her eyes, and a magic that stirred his soul. He tried his best to remain calm, daring not to look directly at her like Liu Zhen. Lady He secretly smiled at his reserved attitude. She asked if he had a wife. Xu Jing had no choice but to say, "With the Xiongnu not yet destroyed, how can I think of a home? I only wish to make a name for myself, so I have not yet considered marriage." Lady He smiled and said, "I heard that when a man is born, he desires a wife with talent. You are at the age to marry a beautiful and gentle lady and enjoy the bliss of love, so how is it that you don't have a bedmate yet? Shall I play matchmaker for you?" After speaking, she giggled. Xu Jing found it difficult to answer and sat upright, looking at his nose. Lady He said again, "Do you find it lonely here? You can come in and chat often, there are no outsiders here. The old man has learned about Buddhism and is very eccentric. He doesn't come here often during the day, I'm afraid he wants to become a monk." Hearing Lady He refer to Wang Yongtai as "the old man" behind his back, Xu Jing felt somewhat displeased. He stood up and said, "I still have other matters outside, so I will take my leave." Lady He said, "Why don't you sit for a while longer? Why do you have to leave so soon?" Xu Jing said, "Since there is nothing else, I will not stay longer." Then he turned and walked out of the pavilion, still hearing Lady He giggling; perhaps she was laughing at Xu Jing for being somewhat silly. Xu Jing returned to his room, hung the Red Phoenix Sword on the wall, and sat thinking about Lady He's attitude earlier, which lacked grace. Although she was beautiful and refined, on closer inspection, she ultimately seemed like a small family's daughter trying to imitate her mistress. Wang Yongtai is old and has married such a frivolous young woman as a concubine, which is probably not a blessing for the household. He is honest and upright, and treats people with kindness, not suspecting others of having malicious intentions, but such people should be guarded against. However, how can I tell him directly? He felt somewhat troubled. Since that day, Xu Jing paid even more attention to Lady He's cousin, Sang Yiqing, because he often saw Sang Yiqing running into the inner chamber. On several occasions after Wang Yongtai had gone out, Sang Yiqing hurriedly walked out of the inner chamber in the evening, just as Xu Jing was walking in the courtyard. When Sang Yiqing saw him, he quietly slipped away elsewhere. Xu Jing could not help but be suspicious. (57)</p>
<h3>Summary of the Philosophy of Vigorous Practice</h3>

<h3>"Mandarin Duck Robbery" on Stage</h3>
<p>— Xi Shi</p>
<p>Since the premiere of "Home," the Shanghai Drama Society has been performing it for three months due to its great success. Apart from the performance of "A Family of Liars," there have been no new plays for a long time. The audience has been requesting new plays several times. "Striving for Strength" was originally scheduled to premiere last month, but due to the large number of performers and the temporary difficulty in setting up the scenery, it had to be postponed. Now, it has been decided to premiere "Mandarin Duck Robbery" starting on the 9th.</p>
<p>The audience may be familiar with the name "Mandarin Duck Robbery"! Everyone may remember "Mandarin Duck Robbery," starring Vivien Leigh and Laurence Olivier, which premiered at the Cathay Theater in March. It was a literary tragedy that was greatly praised by the audience. The Shanghai Drama Society's "Mandarin Duck Robbery" is the same story as the movie. The play is originally a stage play by the famous British playwright John Galsworthy. The American film company adapted it into a movie. If we see this play on stage, its original style and charm will definitely be more moving than the movie.</p>
<p>The director is Wu Renzhi, and the actors are Bai Li and Hu Dao, who play the young couple in the play—Wenda and Laili. Shi Hui plays the judge Qi Si. The entire play is very tense, with both men and women dying for love. It is much more powerful than forcing a reunion in the movie.</p>
<p>When "Mandarin Duck Robbery" is performed, a one-act play—"Seeking Pleasure"—will also be performed. Directed by Zuo Lin. Yingzi, Shi Yuan, and Han Fei will perform it. Coincidentally, it is the opposite of "Mandarin Duck Robbery," it is a farce that makes people laugh. The performance period is only four days—from the 9th to the 12th. The society's Zheng Chen is rehearsing Xia Yan's famous work "The Most Painful Memory," which will be performed next.</p>
