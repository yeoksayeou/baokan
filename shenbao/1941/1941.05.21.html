<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c13">關於蘇聯的態度 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>尋繹歸納近來國際上的種種表現與預兆，不能不令人聯想到國際前途又有重大的演變，正在醖釀之中。更因當前時局的嚴重與尖銳，牠的複雜性與迷茫性，實較既往任何時期的醖釀爲更甚。</p>
<p>當前最嚴重的問題，要算蘇德兩方面對於近東問題的態度。其間以蘇聯而論，允是未來國際形勢演進中最主要的因素。巴爾幹問題，一般都認爲牠絕對不會袖手不問的，然而牠終於袖手了，英希南終於失敗了。關於土耳其的，向來認爲牠不會容忍德義勢力的銳進，然而這兩天來的消息，足使關心土耳其前途的人們，覺得非常不安。又如關於蘇聯之與日本簽訂協定、雖非怎樣的意外，然亦加深了前途的迷茫性。由這種種布局與煙幕，使蘇聯對於德義伸入近東，究取怎樣的熊度，迷離恍惚，不可捉摸之極。</p>
<p>澈底推敲，不得不疑問於蘇聯這半年來種種舉措的動機安在？如果說，牠的外交唯一原則，在於避免捲入戰爭漩渦，則明眼人都看得出。它歷决的舉動，實際是使戰爭一步一步更逼近牠自已的疆土；而且以牠立國的基本來說，牠絕不是『任何代價下和平』原則的信仰者。如果說，牠的政策之運用，在於根本劃淸帝國主義混戰與爲自已生存而戰之間的界限，則南希抗戰與英德交戰，其根性顯然是不同的。縱或退一步說。南希後來與英國打成一片。使蘇聯不得不忍痛袖手，但在希臘單獨對義大利抗戰的時候，希臘並未與英沆瀣一氣：那時候，蘇聯也並沒有採取什麼堅强步驟。去阻止戰爭擴大，遏止侵略兇燄，以保存弱小鄰邦者，保障牠自身的安全。如果說，蘇聯的一切運用，在於打破帝國主義聯合進攻的可能，這正是德義向來對英法引誘的幌子，爲張伯倫一派所贊同，而現在則早已過去了，亦即英美與德義間，絕無突然携手進攻蘇聯的可能。進一步說：在地理上，有包圍進攻蘇聯的可能者，原來祗有德義日；在資源上垂涎蘇聯的，也祇有德義日；而絕非英美。縱使謂蘇聯對英美不能不特別提防，然蘇聯也絕不會因此而從侵略集團方面覓取抵銷。如果說，蘇聯當前唯一目標在於瓦解英帝國機構，而促成弱小民族的解放；然考求事實，蘇聯並沒有特別積極援助弱小民族的解放運動；何况絕無理由，得以置信於德義會成爲印度，阿比西尼亞等國的救星？</p>
<p>溯念往事，人類正義力量之所以無法團結或合作，則往昔的英法美諸國實較蘇聯負有較重的責任；但在最近這半年來，蘇聯的種種舉措，實使團結合作的可能更爲渺遠。當然，當時的決策實較事後的檢討爲易於錯誤，而決策的錯誤往往爲任何國家所不免。然而現在可謂千鈞一髮的危急時機，勇於悔過，糾正闕失，正應該即什現在的一霎那，故英，美，蘇三方面個別或協同重大舉動的出現，亦得視為並非不可能。不若是而不幸局勢在進一步的惡化，則除非謂「蘇聯的一切，要在延長所有資本主義國家的惡豆，而到最後，自己坐收漁翁之利，發動一個所謂世界革命，」此外，別無足資說明者。</p>
<p>「世界革命」云云理論的是非，故置勿論，所值得指出的：其一，德，義，日三國一千曾經竭力誇張這個說法，企圖鼓動所有的帝國主義，集合起來，形成進攻蘇聯的十字軍；他們且在充任急先鋒的條件下，向英法等國索取瓜分世界權利為代價。其二，自從這次歐戰發動以來，英法美等國比較懷有正義感的人士們，已經完全克服了他們國內這一派說法的阻礙，而逕行從事對德義的大戰；他們信仰世界進步的必然性，而反對德義開倒車，試證以戰爭開始以來，所有民治國家方面對於戰後世界改造理想的討論，和侵略國集團所謂「新秩序」，以及各民治國對思想活動自由的容忍程度，和侵略者國內的摧殘迫害，作一總得比較，則雙方對立之中，那一方面是蘇聯未來可能的友伴，是非常明顯的。設若蘇聯以自己的舉措和姿態，使對他懷有惡意者們獲得藉口，證實了所謂「漁翁」，這在各民治國所蒙打擊與不幸，自不待言‘而更要緊的，卻是蘇聯本身此後必須獨立對付這一勢所必至，而為空前所未有的危機！至於世界革命的實現與吾，祗好留待蘇聯對付了危機之後再說。</p>

<p>英義兩國海軍曾於本年三月廿八日在地中海發生一决大戰，關於此役戰况，美國Christian　ScienceMonitor載有該報特派員從英國地中海艦隊旗艦華斯配特號上發出的無綫電報吿，茲譯錄如决：</p>
<p>英國地中海艦隊久欲與義大利艦隊作一決戰，苦無機會。迨至本年三月二十七日，英國方面偵得義大利艦隊已從該國南部巴薩洛角出發，分爲兩隊，一隊在南，其中有主力艦一艘，一隊在北，其中有主力艦兩艘，各有巡洋艦及驅逐艦多艘。英國艦隊即於决日整隊從亞力山大港出發，準備襲擊，一面派海軍飛機四出搜索。</p>
<p>這天日裏，義大利南路艦隊主力艦列都里亞號，（排水量三萬五千噸下水未久）首被英機所放空中魚雷重創，航行最高速率，從三十二海里减至十五海里。另有巡洋艦和驅逐艦多艘，也被英國轟炸機擊中。</p>
<p>到了晚上，英國艦隊即在希臘克里特島西端海面，和義大利這一艦隊，正式接觸。其時英國方面主力艦華斯配特號，伐里恩特號及巴哈姆號，一齊開放十五英寸口徑大砲，義國巡洋艦波拉號，柴拉號，孚姆號三艘，中彈受傷，英國驅逐艦繼又施放魚雷，把它們一一擊沈。此時義大利艦隊陣容凌亂，巡洋艦一艘叉被砲彈擊，中，下落不明。另有驅逐艦多艘也受重創，大抵亦遭覆沒。</p>
<p>事後，英國海軍部宜佈，是役英艦並無沈沒，水兵亦無死傷。義國海軍部財承認英國海軍擊沈巡洋艦三艘，但稱英國巡洋艦一艘也被擊沈。</p>
<p>至於作戰詳細情形有如下述。。</p>
<p>英國旗艦華斯配特號的甲板上層，先有少數軍官，充滿着緊張情緒。這種緊張是不是平常夜裹感覺得到的。而是臨戰前一刹那間的興奮情緒。</p>
<p>這時九點鐘還沒有敲，他們和地中海艦隊總司令克銀漢上將談着話，連烟都不抽，整個艦隊掩沒在黑暗中。克銀漢上將壯重肅穆，不慌不忙，口裹只發出簡短的軍令。</p>
<p>當前的情勢，大家都已了然於胸。英國潛水艇在二十七日已發現義大利艦隊，從西西利島極東北的巴塞洛角東駛。英國地中海艦隊立刻從亞力山大港出發，駛往克利特島的蘇達灣埋伏。</p>
<p>二十八日晨，巡洋艦奧里盎號探得敵艦已分爲南北兩隊鼓浪前進。的模傍晚時分，英國艦隊主力就尾隨旗艦華斯配特號後面，駛入愛奧尼亞海，霏近預定作戰的海面。希臘幾輕艘快兵艦，也參加在內。</p>
<p>意大利驅逐艦中炸彈裂情形　英國地中海艦隊德因令克爾漢</p>
<p>夜幕旣降，英國艦隊知道此刻已接近敵艦南隊，多月來望眼欲穿的大戰，瞬息就要展開了。</p>
<p>英國艦隊中主力艦華斯配特號，伐里恩特號姊妹艦，（排水量各三萬零六百噸，配十五英吋口徑大砲。）及擺哈姆號三艘，（排水量三萬五千一百噸，配十五英吋口徑大砲），小心前進，驅逐艦隊在兩旁掩護，艦上水兵都已各就崗位，探照兵蹲踞在探海燈後面，信號兵準備好小燈台，大砲引火待發，輔助砲也裝就照明砲彈，指揮官們都張大了一雙餓眼，搜索他們的目的物。</p>
<p>九節鐘剛過，瞥見一個黑影，眞相難辨，或許是敵方南隊主力艦維尼都號（排水量三萬五千噸，配十五英寸口徑大砲。）克銀漢上將就號令一聲</p>
<p>到了十點鐘，艦隊列成陣容。二十分鐘後，黑沉沉的一個艦隊，居然在右方出現了，同時左方也有敵艦一艘挑戰，克銀漢決定捨棄左方的孤艦，而與敵方主力交鋒，下令全部艦向右九十度。</p>
<p>這麽一來，雙方艦隊嚴陣相待，敵艦近在咫尺，顯已無需發射照明炮彈了。</p>
<p>英國驅逐艦葛萊洪號急急向敵陣投射一道燈光，恰巧照着敵陣第三艘巡洋艦孚姆號。華斯配特號看得淸切，驀地開放邊砲一排，砲彈落處，只見敵艦首尾火光迸裂，後部瞭望台骨落翻落海中。華斯配特號緊接着饗以排砲一列，孚姆號開始着火，就此一蹶不振了。</p>
<p>華斯配特號旣吿得手，克銀漢上將命移轉砲火，瞄準敵陣第二艘，即孚姆號的妹姊艦柴拉號，該艦即又中彈着火，英艦乘勢再向牠們的姊妹艦波拉號進攻。在某一個時候，柴拉號和波拉號都在兩舷懸掛白布要求罷戰。另有敵方驅逐艦戈信蒂號和梅斯萊爾號則施放烟幕，圖企脫逃，也被擺哈姆號打得落花流水。</p>
<p>正在這個時候，英艦海海燈發現敵方另有驅逐艦兩艘，正作利用優越地位，向英艦發射魚雷，英艦均沒有防備，幸而這些魚雷穿過英艦都撲了個空。克銀漢不願主力艦受損，乃命各主力艦專讓驅逐艦去收拾那些負傷的敵艦。</p>
<p>英國的驅逐艦至少有兩隊，每隊八艘，每艘携帶魚雷八枚左右，一齊對射，海面頓成魚雷世界。</p>
<p>夜半，海戰結束，義艦重創纍纍，北隊始終沒有出戰。後來英國偵察機八架飛往戰區海面，瞭見義大利水兵幾百名正坐着救生艇倉皇逃命呢。</p>

<p>大門之左，爲土山灣印書館，我們順着右手，遶着廻廊，穿進了竹籬門，中間有一絕大的廣塲，兩旁廻廊之內，盡是房屋，可是怎麼大的一座庭院，雅雀無聞，淸靜異常。志堯先生先須進堂去誦經，我雖不是公敎徒，但從主人所好，也隨着進去，同樣地跪在旁邊，瞻仰堂內的莊嚴陳飾。出來，隨即去訪問院長呂道茂神父；呂神父銀鬟飄飄，於目光烱烱。威毅神態中流露着仁慈氣概。辦理了人院手續，承呂神父陪着去參觀，順道先參觀繪畫部分，有的在畫布景，有的在製圖案，亦有人將幻燈底片，對着陽光在飾色。此外所陳列美術製品，彩色玻璃，五光十色，一時看不盡這許多。壁上懸有明人服裝，首到中國傳敎的利瑪竇，及紅纓帽，石靑外套，淸代服裝的湯若望南懷仁的畫像，這皆爲介紹西方科學傳入中國有絕大勞續的人。再進去，穿過腰門，懸有「慈雲小學」的脾，即是孤兒院的學校部分，一座三層樓大洋房，在以前，却是百歲老人馬相伯先生修道著作之起居處，將來在歷史上自有其紀念價値。如今一二兩層，都成爲孤兒的敎室，第三層作爲寢室；我們先從二層樓上走廊中　問一間參觀過去，下樓，又承呂神父介紹見校長張夢漁神父。張神父，汕東人，世爲公敎士，所以闔族爲修士神父的甚多，張神父其一也。張神父神采奕奕，態度慈祥，曾患胃病，三决奏刀施手術，而健康如常：我深信，凡有眞實修詩的人，必有共偉大精神處。天主敎修道的規律甚嚴，絕色絕財絕怠，所以到了疾患相侵的時候，他精神上自有其安慰寄托，那顧及肉體上之苦痛。不要說張神父。，即友人徐春榮，他是篤信佛敎的，亦爲胃潰瘍兩决割治，割去手掌大的兩塊，其後亦無損於其健康。</p>
<p>我們又多一位陪我們去參觀的人，經過了一座大操塲，從一列篠懸木綠蔭下竹籬中間進去，有一座外觀很樸陋而內部很整潔的敎室，這就是一年級讀書之所。另外一座，是他們的寢室，一張一張的小鐵床，排列得很整齊。</p>
<p>我們又承張神父見告，方知道這孤兒院，有八十六年的歷史；創辦的是薛孔昭神父，還是咸豐五年（西曆一八五五年），開辦於靑浦蔡家灣，咸豐十年（西曆一八六〇年）被燬，遷至上海董家渡，再於同治二年（一八六四年）方運居今址。全院面積占六十三畝，除了敎室寢室之外，病房，浴室，雨操塲，洗衣室，西樂室，大禮堂，莫不齊備；此外有三處遊息塲，空氣新鮮，不在話下</p>
<p>凡孤兒六歲以上入院的，無論其爲聾啞殘廢，各按程度，編入各級肄衆，小學共分六年級，此外尙有初中一級，及學徒補習班一級，聾啞生複式編制一級，張神父尙擬於最近的將來辦一孤兄的職業中學，以宏孤兒的迅就。入院的孤兒，經塡具保證書，即可進院·進院後，所有衣食住書籍，並一應生活所需，無不由院供給；每日一飯二粥，每星期肉食二决，故營養甚爲充足·至於健康史加注意，除了防疫種痘之外，較重的病症，即送廣慈醫院治療。學生除完成六年小學敎育外，成績較好的，可繼續升學，差一點的分派在自設的各工塲習藝；須待他能自立後，遂許他出外就業，或仍留院工作，有這樣設備，繼當得起孤兒的樂園了！</p>

<p>中西兩種繪畫的覜點、全完不同、中國畫是偏於理想、主張寫意寫悄的、所以有重山疊嶺的風景、有不落邊際的花果、史有寥寥數筆的人物畫、講求氣韻神情、而含有詩意的、西洋畫則不然、必需根據透視。遠近。光綫色彩輪廓、一些不可差池、不過最近後期印象派的作風、也與中國畫較爲接近、並不十分講究這種機械的方法了、至於工，具方面、中西繪畫也絕對不同、中國畫用毛筆、畫在宣紙上面的、西洋畫用用鉛筆、鋼筆或者毛筆、畫什磅紙、水彩畫紙以及羅布上面的、顏色方面、中國畫中、山水較爲簡單、僅有水墨·綫絳·靑綠金碧幾種、花烏則則必需依據各種花鳥本來的顏色、加以配合、主要的有鉛粉。花靑·石靑·石綠·籐黃·赫石·大紅·胭脂·朱砂·朱標等隨時調和應用、西畫顫色可分爲西洋紅·朱紅·菊黃·檸檬黃·羣靑·普藍·草綠·深綠·焦茶·白粉等·並分水質·油質·粉質·三大類、也是隨時調和應用的、中國畫有堂幅·屏幅·立幅·册頁·手卷之分、堂幅的長度、倍於闊度一倍、屏幅的長度、倍於闊度三倍、立服長度、備於關度二三倍不等、冊頁一尺見方為多、手卷高度、大都一尺以上、尺半以下、闊度則並無一定、堂幅屏幅立幅便於懸掛、冊頁手卷便於收藏、允以手卷最爲有趣、一面看、一面卷、大有目不暇接之概、西洋畫的格式長度闊度大的五與三之比、所謂「黃金律、」不論橫直、總是如此的、</p>

<h3 id="c94">關於「徵婚廣告」　——我並不毛遂自薦 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 樂雲展</p>
<p>因爲自己是一個未婚的男子，所以對於報紙上的女子徵婚廣吿，時常引起我的注意。但是又因爲自己的淺薄和無能，同時又疑惑到徵求者的用意所在，所以一向未曾嘗試地做一决應徵人。</p>
<p>理由是：徵求人對周遭所認識的男子俱不屑屬意，巴巴的去徵求素昧平生的陌生男子，其眼界自是高人一等。我自知是一個一無特長的人，與其應徵而必遭落選，何必多此一舉！况且上海爲人材薈萃之所，財富與才能，旣遠不及人，何如藏拙爲妙。</p>
<p>同時也有許多男子在微求女友和伴侶，而且大都是大學畢業；身份呢，不是職業高尙，定是月入頗豐。像這樣的人也還在刊廣吿去徵求女友和老婆，令人愈感覺着求偶之難，而得女友之不易了。</p>
<p>於是女子徵婚廣吿雖多，我却益發不敢應微。</p>
<p>蔽是我小知道她們或他們徵求的結果，是不是會有美滿的對象，而得到理想的配偶呢</p>
<p>「無誠意者，請勿嘗試」。這句話差不多每一條徵婚廣吿裏都有，用意當然是想避免好事者的戲弄，譬如男子恐怕同性奢的冒牌，而女子則恐怕已婚男子的欺詐。其實所謂「請勿嘗試」者，根本就是矛盾，因爲徵求者旣不能前知有沒有合乎自己理想的異性來應徵，而應徵者更不能確知自己能不能中選；而徵求人是吾合乎以爲可以人選的那個應徵人的冀望，更是個極大問題；你在嘗試地徵求，他在嘗試並應徵，雙方的本意，無非都在嘗試着吧了，所謂「誠意」也者，也似乎談不大到吧？</p>
<p>聽說微求者的第二個步驟，都是這樣的，允其是女子：從信箱中收集了應徵者的函件後，合意的就的期面晤，好像給茶室，公園，或旅舍招徠生意似的，叫你在是日某時在某處某即唔叙。自己的居處地址，則諱莫如深。而應微人爲着要接收徵求人的回音起見，却不能不把眞實的地址寫明。這一點，應微人顯然比較微求人來得「誠意」了。</p>
<p>至於年齡，籍貫，履歷，職業，與家庭狀况等，應徵人就是作僞，也不能不詳細塡寫。而徵求人却可以從容不迫地「躱在信箱裏」審愼查研，其手段眞是霸道得可以。所以有些人雖欲應微亦因而不願嘗試。有幾個呢，與其應微，不如也一變而爲微求，誰不知化小數廣吿費就比校穩妥得多呢。</p>
<p>其實，我以爲眞具誠意的徵求者，自己先把姓名地址和一切詳情老老實實的刋出來，其结果一定比借用信箱的來得美滿有效。</p>
<p>不過，這也是說說吧了，我若爲徵求人，恐怕也辦不到吧。</p>
<h3 id="c95">二種流星人物 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 丁朮</p>
<p>「要錢不要命」和「認票不認人」是目前最流行的二種人物。—他們其實是難兄難弟。</p>
<p>前一種本祇是低微階級，像黃包車夫，小販等，不惜爲了一分鐘的爭執，顯出以性命來換取牠的神氣。現在則就是士大夫之流也皆以此爲準繩。他們爲了多刮幾個作孽錢，不要說不顧大家死活，還甘願犧牲一切，爲孔方兄殉節呢！</p>
<p>後者則好似戴着一副貼上紅綠色彩紙的眼鏡。所能望見的，不是別的，鈔票而已。於是乎在牠的圈框中，永不會瞧見友人，相熟，同僚等。祇要他一副架上，什麼掘祖墳，剝屍衣等，都會興高采烈地去幹呢！</p>
<p>嗚呼，守財奴和勢利者！</p>
<h3 id="c96">「門檻」 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>如果有人要在上海做做「人」的話，就該先懂得「門檻」</p>
<p>「門檻」是「生活的藝術」：「門檻」精，路路皆通；「門檻不精，專碰釘子！</p>
<p>兩袖淸風的人，紙要爬幾爬，鑽幾鑽，或者哭幾哭也不妨；那末「眼睛一霎」，「老雄鷄」立刻變「鴨」。這又沒有什麼「深奧」的「訣巧」的，簡簡單單曰「門檻」！</p>
<p>也許天生「老實坯」，拍不懂，媚不懂，這樣那樣都不懂；那末頭上撞起個疙瘩的事固然常會發生，就是一不小心倒裁下來跌個「粉身碎骨」也非爲「過」。</p>
<p>所以，一言以蔽之，對「門檻」需要「打得火熱」，不然的話，也得「佛樣敬它，賊樣防它。」</p>
<p>（這也是個「門檻」！）</p>

<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>病房裏便祇剩兩個人了。</p>
<p>「光是臉上受一些刀傷，你的身子不應該道樣虧弱啊！」玉崑站到床前去問。「老三，別處可曾給他們做過沒有？要是受了內傷，這些洋大夫就根本治不好！」</p>
<p>秋海棠很乏力地搖了搖頭，竭力想伸出一條手去拉住玉崑的手，但力氣竟一些也沒有。</p>
<p>「我不比你，受了這塲恥辱，心裹老是悶得很…。」他說話時顯得更吃力，說了三句便不得不緩一口氣。「一面又惦記她和梅寶兩惦人，所以……這幾天來……，睡也睡不熟，吃也吃不下……。」</p>
<p>玉崑似乎很小以爲然的勉强笑了一笑。</p>
<p>「依我說，你們這樣的事壓根兒就是多餘的！」在他的人生觀上，大概只有喝酒是做人的大事。「現在弄得吃了苦還不算，躺在醫院裏也不能安靜，一天到晚，還要牽腸掛肚的惦記人家。那末，待我吿訴你吧！梅實的病先頭眞是害不輕，但這兩天巳經照舊會跳會笑，像一頭小白狗一樣了。」</p>
<p>秋海棠很出神地聽着，同時又在玉崑的臉上發現了一個奇蹟…從前這個武工好得像一個飛賊一樣的丑角，對於孩子是從不覺感興趣的，儘管他時常隨着秋海棠上他們的金屋去，甚至單獨前去巷他們料理那個家，但見了梅寳，總是只笑笑就算了。——（一一一）</p>
<h3 id="c98">沒有米的宴席 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾子芒</p>
<p>在××樓，在××大飯店，在××茶室，每天每天在白熱的燈光下，舖張着沒有米的筵席。</p>
<p>那鑲銀杯碟，象牙筷的圓檯面上，輝映着一個個興高彩烈的臉。</p>
<p>他們磕着瓜子，抓着杏仁，喝着雨前茶。</p>
<p>隔了一會，客人到齊了，於是主人家吩咐開席吃過了一些是一隻甚麼窰的「御品」，盛着一碗「淸湯魚翅」竟先上來了，主人第一個動起銀匙，跟來是一陣碰擊的聲音，但是，突然給一個穿着黑馬掛團花綢夾衫的老年紳士壓制住了：</p>
<p>「啊，袁先生，眞對不起，對面的陶醉樓還有一個宴會，抱歉了我先走一步！」</p>
<p>魚翅之後是炒蝦仁，炸鮭魚，麻辣子鷄，等等八大熱炒，主賓歡暢的大嚼之餘，免不了「歌舞上來」了，於是字條子「叫局」，愛「摩登」的也打個電話到嚮導社去喊個「導花」來唱「何日君再來」，或表演個「玫瑰玫瑰我愛你」……</p>
<p>接着又是「六大菜」了—擺了六個動物的屍體無非鷄鴨之類，不過最使人感興趣的是隻燒得紅紅的蹄髈。</p>

<h3 id="c100">談上海影院的座價 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>上海的影院，以性質分，可以別爲三種：一種是專映國片的，另一種是專映西片的；還有一種是中外影片兼映的；此外最普通的尙有頭輪，二輪，三輪等之分；而三輪的影院大都可包括在中外影片兼映的一類內，現在就根據這二種分法，讓筆者來談談關於各家所訂的座價，影迷們不妨作爲觀影的指導。</p>
<p>先拿專映西片的影院來說吧，頭輪的大光明，國泰，大華，南京及大上海等四家的座價是一律的，最低的爲一元五角；較戰前漲起二倍半；週末與平日的座價是不同的；中午二塲與夜間一塲又略有區別，這四家影院對於兒童都沒有什麼優待的規定，南京是在戰後取消的。大上海的座價介於頭輪與二輪之間，可是遇開映頭輪影片的時候，又將座價提高與大光明等同；二輪的有巴黎，金門，光陸，麗都，平安等幾家，除了麗都把兒童的座價另定外，其餘的一概分八角，一元一，一元三角三種。</p>
<p>專映頭輪國片的影院原來有五家即金城，國聯，新光，金都，及滬光。木來國聯的座價是最低的。最近國聯已把座價劃爲與其他幾家一律，而金都是降爲好像與大上海一般了；它們有一個特點是頭輪西片影院不備的，每逢星期日早晨他們必加映一决早塲，並且把座價酌量减低，允其是滬光，特別優待兒童；不過除了星期日的早塲外就沒有此種優待了，有人說這未免是美中的不足。專映二輪國片的影院，僅中央及亞蒙二家，座價最低是六角。</p>
<p>目前上海可以說最多的是中外影片兼映的三四輪影院，而這類影院所訂的座價亦最複雜，分析起來大都在四角與五角之間，唯杜美與辣斐二家則較昂。杜美有時尙開映頭輪的蘇聯影片。</p>
<p>歸納一句，現在上海正式影院的座價最低的是四角；最高的近六元，但如果工部局實行徵收娛樂捐後，我相信座價亦會跟着向增高的。</p>

<p>— 由陵</p>
<p>昔貂公居愚園路慶雲里時，余等同爲三房客，故略知其事一二，唯皆瑣碎小事，今述之以吿關心貂公者：</p>
<p>淸潔運動　貂公本姓吳，家人皆呼其爲明香，因其貌似胡蝶，故甚爲當時攝影記者所圍，不勝其煩，而「明星照片」之雅號，亦由是而起矣。當初搬入慶雲里時，黎莉莉爲其唯一摯友，常往訪之，間作淸潔運動，黎莉莉身壯力健，代作粗笨工作，如拖地板等，彼則揩椅刷窗，如是者，的三四日一决。</p>
<p>房客代勞　某晚無戲，與余等談及彼小時見鬼事，據云：「幼時與父駕車往龍華，途見輪下鬼，無頭，驚極，而吾父泰然，是晚談至十二時許，彼不敢進房獨臥，竟堅留余等待天明放行。當時因其走紅非凡，故應酬亦忙，是以家中一切瑣碎，託同居房客或房東之女傭，如外出而門未鎖，游泳衣曬而未收拾等，皆房客等爲其代勞。</p>
<p>威脅訂婚　居數月，一陳姓麻皮追求甚烈，彼置之不理，某日陳姓化名邀請，彼踐的，後知陳，堅欲回，陳阻止並以種種威脅迫其簽訂婚的，幸彼哄騙而回，未幾聞彼下嫁某君（名已忘）住模範村，臨去時的余等前往遊玩，惜余等始終未去也。一日有女學生三四，闖門向入，向之索簽名照，時適照片缺乏，婉言謝絕，女學生堅不肯走，並有似哭喪臉而苦苦哀求者，余等見之，莫不啞然失笑。</p>
<p>戰後景况　戰事方起，聞某君雙目失明，彼往杳港，傳聞又下嫁其君，眞實如何則不知。待後彼復回滬加入藝華，拍「閻惜妓」「王寳釧」等，不得志，復内染肺病，而被「留職停薪」今尙在靜養期中，聞近况極爲凄慘。吁！藝人下塲如此，吾不禁爲之嘆惜。甚願貂公早日回復健康，繼續努力，埋頭苦幹，則消途猶有望也。</p>

<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>山上衆水很淸，懸崖間有瀑布如倒懸珠簾流在石上，發出敲金戞玉的聲音，這又是威鳳山上的勝跡。日落時二人回歸廬舍。柳隱英的姑母巳煮好幾樣菜，爲客佐餐。天黑時，小婢掌上燈來，二人便在書室中對坐飲酒。桌上放着菜肴，有鷄有肉。許靖瞧着，對柳隱英說道；「遊子他鄉，得借一橡以蔽風雨，巳是萬幸。乃蒙主人好客，殺鷄作黍，如此殷動，何以克當？」柳隱英道：一山肴野簌，無以娛客，請許君喝兩杯白酒而已。」一邊說，一邊代許情斟酒。許靖托着酒杯，謝了一聲，把一杯酒一飲而盡。道：「有酒有餚，不可多得，只是做客的太叨擾了。」見柳隱英杯中酒少，就提藍酒壺代他斟滿了，說道：「請柳兄也幹一杯吧。」柳隱英微笑道：「小弟是不勝蕉葉，量小得很，，喝半杯吧。」說罷舉起酒杯湊至脣邊，喝了一半，又拿過酒壺代許靖斟個滿。許靖又喝了一個罄凈。許靖是能飲的，柳隱夾却不會喝的，被許靖屢决相勸喝了一杯多，兩頰已是酡然，在燈光下紅噴噴地如同蘋菓一般，越見嫵媚。許靖瞧着，暗想孟子說的不知子都之姣者無目者也。柳隱英雖是個男子，而容貌秀麗如，同女子一樣。我和李信在故鄉杞縣，可稱得美男子，現在若和柳隱英相較，叉不免珠玉在前，自慚形穢了。柳際英見許靖對他細瞧，笑了一笑道：一小弟是不會喝酒的，請許君多喝些吧。這時許靖的赤鳳寳劍已卸在一旁，柳隱英忽然一眼瞧見對便許靖說道；「方繼我瞧許君所用的寳劍不是平常之物，可吾賞賜一觀？」許靖運忙去取過來雙手奉上說道：「此物也平常得很，尙乞勿笑。」柳隱夾接過，颼的抽出鞘子來，寒光一道，森森四壁。劍光一閃一動猶如紫電。柳隱英摩挲一下嘖嘖稱讚道：「好劍好劍，是不是祖傳的？」許靖便將自己在鄉間如何發現劍氣，在河中掘得的經過，約略吿訴一遍。柳隱英道：「如此說來，這是天賜與許君的了。望許君將來善自用之，莫員此劍。」許靖道：「柳兄箴言，敢不拜嘉。」柳隱英便把劍仍挿入鞘還與許靖。（六八）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Large Shipment of American Military Supplies Arrives in Chongqing; China's Combat Strength Enhanced; US Adopts Armed Joint Defense Plan in the Pacific; Air Power Sufficient to Deter Japanese Ambition to Advance South <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Manila. The news from Moscow and New York that Japan will not advance south has not aroused any interest here. American troops and aircraft continue to arrive, which makes the Filipinos firmly believe that Japan will never dare to infringe on the area under the American flag. Insiders believe that the US government's firm intention has been fully understood by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka. His attempts to probe for peace talks are mostly due to the fear of the flight of a large number of Flying Fortresses to Hawaii and the ease with which Consolidated Aircraft bombers can fly to Singapore. The opinions of American people here can be seen in the remarks of the "Bulletin," which is run by Americans. It said, "Japan's promise not to advance south is not as valuable today as it used to be. The United States has adopted a policy contrary to appeasement and has adopted armed joint defense in the Pacific, which can largely prevent the occurrence of war. But if war is inevitable, it will be enough to cope with it." (United Press dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Brigadier General Clagett, Commander of the US Air Force in the Philippines, is scheduled to fly to Chengdu from Chongqing tomorrow. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London. Reuters Far East correspondent, in reviewing the overall situation in the Far East, said that the main features in the overall situation in the Far East in the near future are the increase in British and American aid to China and the firm attitude toward Japan. Last week, when Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a farewell banquet for US Ambassador Johnson in Chongqing, he said in an impromptu speech, "If democratic countries help with military equipment and economy, Japan can be handed over to China without sending naval and land forces to China." Such views are also evident in London and Washington. After US economic expert Currie and Captain James Roosevelt, the eldest son of President Roosevelt, toured Chongqing, Brigadier General Clagett, Commander of the US Air Force in the Philippines, is now also going to Chongqing for a month-long inspection to study China's military needs. According to reliable sources, a considerable amount of supplies, including aircraft that China needs most urgently, have recently arrived in Chongqing from the United States via the Yunnan-Burma Highway. Although the highway has been bombed by Japanese aircraft many times, traffic continues uninterrupted. Foreign journalists who have recently traveled along this road have all firmly stated that this road will never be interrupted. Although the river bridge has been destroyed, the Chinese are resourceful and have built a temporary pontoon bridge, which is well hidden during the day and can be used without hindrance at night. A large number of workers are densely distributed along the way to fill the holes caused by bombs at any time.</p>

<p>Tokyo. Deputy spokesman Ishii of the Cabinet Intelligence Department announced today that the meeting between Foreign Minister Matsuoka and US Ambassador Grew yesterday was "only a social meeting." Ishii told foreign journalists at a routine press conference that Foreign Minister Matsuoka had invited Ambassador Grew to his private residence for tea, and Grew had also presented the Foreign Minister with excellent cold medicine. When someone asked Ishii whether Japan had the right to treat countries at war in the Sino-Japanese war, Ishii replied that this issue had been discussed many times, but the government's attitude toward this matter had not changed.

<h3 id="e3">British Economic Aid to China Stabilizes the Legal Tender and Has Achieved Results <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Last week, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons that he admired China's firm struggle against Japanese aggression and promised to help China as much as possible. It is said that those who heard it applauded endlessly. Although Britain is in urgent need of military supplies and cannot share them, the recent British loan of £50 million for China's currency stabilization fund has had a stabilizing effect on the exchange rate of legal tender. Another loan of £50 million for China to purchase supplies in the sterling bloc can also be beneficial to China. Eden also stated in his speech that he had clearly informed the Japanese government that if Japan does not earnestly respect its promise to respect British rights in China, then the Japanese side's accusations against Britain for imposing economic restrictions on Japan will not be considered by the British side. The extent to which the Japanese army controls trade in the occupied areas of China is almost incomprehensible to overseas people. The Japanese army blatantly uses the name of control to carry out plundering. No import or export can pass without its permission. Those who are allowed to engage in trade are not distinguished between people from Axis countries and non-Axis countries. Apart from the Japanese, even German and Italian merchants are subject to the same restrictions as other merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Rumored Conditions for German-Soviet Compromise Greatly Alarm the Japanese Authorities <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The fact that Britain and the United States are not moved by Japan's empty threats will definitely make the Japanese, who embrace realism and only value force and do not know appeasement, feel something. Now there are already various signs of a collective resentment trend in Tokyo. The Japanese-Soviet agreement concluded by Matsuoka is not welcomed by the navy and army. They believe that if the Soviet Union continues to transport military supplies to China, then this agreement is useless. At the same time, Japanese newspapers were greatly alarmed when they heard that Germany intended to exchange new concessions from the Soviet Union for conditions that would allow the Soviet Union a free hand in Asia. "Hochi Shimbun," which is most known for its leaning towards the Axis, said that Japan must consider and pay attention to its steps. Even if Germany wins in Europe, it may not necessarily lead to the realization of Japan's hopes in Asia. In summary, the most obvious thing is that if the Japanese army is bogged down in the protracted war in China for one day, then Japan will not be able to go further and launch another large-scale invasion plan for one day.

<p>Washington. Senator Barkley said that President Roosevelt will send a special message to Congress to announce a national emergency. It has not yet been decided, but others believe that the President may soon report the emergency situation to legislators. The news that the President will announce a state of emergency came from Republican Congressman Fish of New York, who said that he might challenge the President's placing the country in a state of undeclared war. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Washington. It was learned here yesterday from the highest authorities that President Roosevelt is considering submitting a special message to Congress on the international situation. He may even declare a full-scale emergency in the article. Roosevelt met with many legislative leaders yesterday morning, the first time in three weeks. Leaders learned that the President may send a special message to Congress to make a statement on the impact of the war on the United States, or even advocate taking new congressional actions. It is reported that if the President decides to send this message, it will be implemented in the near future. United Press reporters also learned that President Roosevelt was reading a document on his desk, but it is not known whether it was a conscription order or a special message to Congress. At the same time, the President also summoned eight squadrons of the National Guard Air Force, one battalion of infantry, and multiple battalions of coastal artillery to enlist in the army. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Washington. The general opinion is that full cooperation between Britain and the United States is not far away. This opinion is becoming more and more powerful because President Roosevelt has various signs of making a major decision. The President's fireside chat is scheduled for May 27, but Senator Barkley, a Democrat from Kent, pointed out after the White House meeting yesterday that the President may send a military message to Congress this week due to the urgency of the situation. Barkley said that this plan is still unclear and he does not want to discuss it. Knowledgeable people here assert that this step will inevitably involve the United States in the war. It is reported that there are very few people who oppose this new plan. The public believes that the government is now preparing the people for more severe actions by the US Navy. According to Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of the Interior Ickes, who issued statements over the weekend stating that the US must not shrink from providing effective assistance to Britain, the aforementioned confidence is based on the statements of Hull and Ickes. It is generally believed that this decision is not a declaration of war against Germany, because this development must be initiated by Congress, but Congress is not prepared to take this step.

<h3 id="e13">On the Attitude of the Soviet Union <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Abstracting and summarizing the recent international expressions and omens, one cannot but be reminded that there are major changes in the international future brewing. Moreover, due to the severity and sharpness of the current situation, its complexity and ambiguity are even greater than in any previous period of brewing.</p>
<p>The most serious problem at present is the attitude of both the Soviet Union and Germany towards the Near East issue. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it is certainly the most important factor in the evolution of the future international situation. The Balkan issue is generally believed that it will never stand idly by, but it finally stood idly by, and the British-Greek-Yugoslav alliance finally failed. Regarding Turkey, it has always been believed that it will not tolerate the sharp advance of German and Italian forces, but the news of the past two days has made people who care about Turkey's future feel very uneasy. Another example is the Soviet Union's signing of an agreement with Japan, although not entirely unexpected, has also deepened the ambiguity of the future. From these arrangements and smoke screens, it is extremely elusive what kind of attitude the Soviet Union will take towards Germany and Italy extending into the Near East.</p>
<p>After thoroughly pondering, one cannot but question the motives behind the Soviet Union's various measures in the past six months? If we say that its only diplomatic principle is to avoid being involved in the vortex of war, then everyone with eyes can see that its long-standing actions have actually brought the war closer and closer to its own territory; and based on the fundamentals of its founding, it is by no means a believer in the principle of "peace at any cost." If we say that the application of its policies lies in fundamentally clarifying the boundary between the imperialist melee and the war for its own survival, then the nature of the South-Nazi resistance and the British-German war is obviously different. Even if we take a step back, the South-Nazi later became one with Britain, forcing the Soviet Union to reluctantly stand idly by, but when Greece was fighting Italy alone, Greece did not collude with Britain; at that time, the Soviet Union did not take any strong steps to prevent the expansion of the war, curb the flames of aggression, to protect small neighboring countries, and to protect its own security. If we say that all the Soviet Union's actions are aimed at breaking the possibility of a united imperialist offensive, this is exactly the bait that Germany and Italy have always used to lure Britain and France, which was endorsed by the Chamberlain faction, but now it has long passed, that is, there is absolutely no possibility of Britain and the United States suddenly joining hands to attack the Soviet Union. To go a step further: geographically, the only countries that originally had the possibility of encircling and attacking the Soviet Union were Germany, Italy, and Japan; and the only countries that coveted the resources of the Soviet Union were also Germany, Italy, and Japan; and certainly not Britain and the United States. Even if it is said that the Soviet Union cannot but be particularly wary of Britain and the United States, the Soviet Union will never seek offset from the aggressive group. If we say that the Soviet Union's only current goal is to disintegrate the British imperial structure and promote the liberation of small nations; but in fact, the Soviet Union has not particularly actively assisted the liberation movements of small nations; moreover, there is absolutely no reason to believe that Germany and Italy will become the saviors of India, Abyssinia, and other countries?</p>
<p>Looking back on the past, the reason why the forces of human justice were unable to unite or cooperate was that the past countries of Britain, France, and the United States were more responsible than the Soviet Union; but in the past six months, the Soviet Union's various measures have made the possibility of unity and cooperation even more distant. Of course, the decision at the time was easier to make mistakes than the review afterwards, and the decision-making errors were often unavoidable by any country. However, now can be said to be a critical moment, and being brave enough to repent and correct mistakes should be at this moment. Therefore, the emergence of individual or joint major actions by the three parties of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union can also be regarded as not impossible. If this is not the case and the situation unfortunately deteriorates further, then unless it is said that "the Soviet Union's goal is to prolong the evil struggle of all capitalist countries, and in the end, it will reap the benefits and launch a so-called world revolution," there is nothing else to explain it.</p>
<p>The right and wrong of the "world revolution" theory are of course not discussed here. What is worth pointing out is that: first, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan once tried their best to exaggerate this claim, trying to mobilize all imperialists to unite and form a crusade to attack the Soviet Union; and they also demanded the right to divide the world from countries such as Britain and France as the price under the conditions of acting as the vanguard. Second, since the outbreak of this European war, people with a relatively strong sense of justice in countries such as Britain, France, and the United States have completely overcome the obstacles of this faction in their countries and have proceeded to engage in a major war against Germany and Italy; they believe in the inevitability of world progress and oppose Germany and Italy turning back the clock. Taking the discussions on the ideal of postwar world reconstruction by all democratic countries since the beginning of the war, the so-called "new order" of the aggressor group, and the degree of tolerance of all democratic countries for freedom of thought and activity, and the destruction and persecution in the aggressor's country, as a general comparison, it is very obvious which side in the opposition is the Soviet Union's future possible companion. Suppose the Soviet Union uses its own actions and gestures to allow those who harbor ill will towards it to gain an excuse to prove the so-called "fisherman," the blow and misfortune suffered by each democratic country will naturally not need to be said. More importantly, the Soviet Union itself must then independently deal with this crisis, which is inevitable and unprecedented! As for the realization of the world revolution, we can only wait until the Soviet Union has dealt with the crisis before talking about it.</p>

<h3 id="e25">US Congress Passes the Philippine Islands Export Control Act - This Act is Applicable to All US Territories <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Washington - A new economic pressure from the United States against Japan, the Soviet Union, and other Axis-affiliated nations, allowing for restrictions on vegetable oils, fats, and hemp, has become possible yesterday. This is because Congress has passed the Philippine Islands Export Control Act and sent it to President Roosevelt for signing. This act also applies to all territories and possessions of the United States. Philippine coconut oil and coconut kernels are well-known raw materials for manufacturing glycerin, gunpowder, and many other essential military supplies. Hemp, a specialty of the Philippines, is the only and irreplaceable raw material for manufacturing ropes, which are essential for ships and many industrial uses. House Speaker Rayburn and Vice President Wallace have signed this resolution to apply the export control regulations to the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Alaska, and the Canal Zone, and sent it to the White House for President Roosevelt's approval. It took just ten days from when Secretary of War Stimson submitted the bill to Congress to its passage yesterday. When the bill was passed in the House, Representative Wolcott, the acting Republican leader, raised some questions. These questions indicated the opposition of isolationists to it. However, after explanations from other representatives that the War Department, the State Department, and the Philippines all supported the bill, Wolcott was satisfied and did not oppose it. Thus, the bill was passed like the Senate version and sent to the White House. It is expected that the White House will approve it soon. The Philippines' support seems to be most crucial in the final consideration of the bill, and the fact that the Philippines is willing to endure any sacrifice to support the common defense has clearly made a deep impression on members of Congress and officials who believe that Philippine leaders are inclined towards Japan and the Axis powers. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Manila - The entire Philippines today unanimously supports President Roosevelt's program to restrict the export of essential raw materials from the islands to aid friendly nations and oppose unfriendly nations. The main Philippine exports, such as coconut kernels, coconut oil, hemp, and iron, will be subject to the export licensing system stipulated by the bill passed by the US Congress yesterday, placing US lands and territories under control procedures. Earlier, before Washington managed this matter, the Philippine Congress was also considering a similar procedure. Most Philippine representatives support the procedure, considering it not only a gesture of goodwill towards the United States but also a demonstration that the Philippines is clearly cooperating with the United States to aid democratic nations and resist totalitarian nations. Authoritative observers say that the passage of the bill by the US Congress to control Philippine exports fills a major loophole in the US export licensing system. Although the United States has banned the export of coconut kernels and coconut oil, these Philippine-produced oils have continued to be shipped to Japan, Shanghai, and Vladivostok in the past six months, and the quantities have increased. Informed sources say that most of these goods are shipped to Moscow and then transshipped to Germany. (United Press)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Following the Surrender of Italian Troops in Abyssinia, the War May Soon End - Small Units of Italian Troops are Still Resisting Fiercely - The Fall of Diredawa Cuts off the Only Retreat Route <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>London - One of the biggest obstacles to the British army's operations in Abyssinia will be removed this afternoon, as the Italian flag on the Amba Alagi fortress will be lowered at that time to signify surrender to the British army. Duke Aosta, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, is scheduled to surrender this afternoon along with General Gazzera and staff officers, in accordance with the terms of surrender. The Cairo Gazette estimates that the British forces captured 7,000 enemy troops at Amba Alagi, along with many artillery pieces and countless war materials. Rome Radio last night acknowledged Aosta's decision to surrender. The station broadcast a telegram from Aosta to Mussolini, stating: "Since we cannot care for the many wounded soldiers and the battle situation is rapidly deteriorating, making prolonged resistance impossible even at the cost of significant losses, I believe it is appropriate to request an honorable surrender from the enemy. This request has been accepted by the enemy." With the fall of Amba Alagi and the surrender of the Italian commander-in-chief, the Italian resistance in Abyssinia is now limited to the Gondar region and the Gimma region (south of Addis Ababa). British forces are rapidly advancing in both of these regions. According to the Cairo Gazette, the Sudanese Defense Force operating in the Gondar region, with the assistance of patriotic Abyssinian forces, has occupied an important position in the Gondar region and severely damaged the Italian army. At the same time, British forces in the south have occupied the key road junction of Diredawa, capturing 800 enemy troops and seizing many artillery pieces and vehicles. The retreat route for two columns of Italian troops in the Gimma region has been cut off. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London - Before the surrender of Amba Alagi, Duke Aosta exchanged telegrams with Mussolini. According to a Rome Radio broadcast, Aosta's telegram explained the inevitability of surrender, stating, "I have certainly done everything that humanly possible could do. It is that which can be a solace at this painful time." Mussolini replied, "The Italian people admire your heroic battles with the troops, and are all convinced about the future with you." (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Cairo - Military figures here claim that it is premature to assert that Duke Aosta's surrender will hasten the end of the Abyssinian war. It is now not able to make a judgement. Currently, two divisions of Italian troops each in the Gimma and Gondar regions, aided by the rains, may resist until the end of the rainy season. However, it is also possible that they will decide to surrender after receiving news of Aosta's surrender. The impact of the British forces' capture of Amba Alagi can be assessed in a few days. Military figures also stressed the importance of the British forces occupying the key road junction of Diredawa. It is said that the only retreat route for the two divisions of Italian troops concentrated in the Gimma and Lake regions has been cut off by the fall of Diredawa. Patriotic Abyssinian forces are lying in ambush in the jungle, waiting for an opportunity to strike hard. Therefore, the Italian army does not dare to retreat into the jungle. However, the area is as large as England. Unless the Italian troops in the area follow the example of their governor and abandon their weapons and surrender, it will still take some time for the British forces to defeat the enemy's resistance. Military figures also mentioned the German attack from the Gapsa Fort. The British Air Force has carried out large-scale dive bombings against the German army. The German army's two attempts to attack the "Hellfire" Pass were unsuccessful. The German army has not yet recovered from the losses suffered in the Solum region. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome - Yesterday, Italians here unanimously believed that the fall of Amba Alagi in Abyssinia was due to the British having more soldiers and military equipment than the Italians. The Italian army had neither aircraft nor anti-aircraft guns. They also solemnly stated that the Italian army even felt a lack of hand grenades before being besieged by the British. However, the Italian army resisted for 40 days. Until the last few days, the Italian commander, Count Aosta, only intended to restrain the British army. At the same time, news from Ethiopia stated that the native Ethiopian troops captured by the British army were forced into British tanks as guides for the British army. However, the native troops used hand grenades to destroy the tanks they were riding in and prevent the British army's advance, perishing with the vehicles. (United Press, 20th)</p>

<p>Bania - As a result of a joint British land and air force operation, the important bridgehead of Fallujah on the Euphrates River, connecting Habbaniyah and Baghdad, has been occupied. The bridgehead was held by some Iraqi troops, who retreated after being driven out of the highlands overlooking the Habbaniyah airfield by British forces. A large area between Habbaniyah and Fallujah was flooded by Iraqi forces, but the British flanking strategy was quite successful. At the same time, British troops transported by aircraft landed in the desert east of Fallujah and set up positions on three sides. The British had previously distributed leaflets warning residents that an attack was inevitable if the garrison did not withdraw. After receiving no response, they began the attack. The capture of this important bridgehead has opened the route to Baghdad. The Iraqi resistance was initially insignificant. The heavy bombing before the British land attack made this battle a great success. When the British army attacked, a German Messerschmitt fighter appeared at high altitude but withdrew after being attacked by the Central Air Force. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>London - General de Gaulle recently submitted a declaration to the British government and the leaders of the Allied governments in London, expressing complete opposition to the "agreements" signed by the Vichy government and the Germans. The declaration stated that the Vichy "government" has reduced itself to a state of being deprived of independence by the invaders. The Vichy government is entirely dominated by an old man, and this old man's senility has been known for many years. Rulers who usurp power and kowtow to the enemy, France cannot be responsible for their actions taken in the name of France. The French nation is currently continuing to fight with all the troops and areas outside the enemy-occupied territories. Therefore, all countries should regard France as a belligerent and the countries fighting the common enemy should regard France as an ally. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>Vichy - It is announced here that Admiral Darlan, Deputy Premier of France, is scheduled to depart for Paris today. (Haitong, 22nd)</p>
<p>London - German news agency says the Vichy government announced that Franco-German negotiations continue to make "satisfactory progress." All French officials and industrial and agricultural owners who need to go to the occupied areas in the northwest for administrative and economic reasons will be allowed to go by the Germans. The plan to repatriate some prisoners of war is under consideration. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters commentator stated that the Vichy government issued a public announcement yesterday stating that 100,000 French prisoners of war will be released and that Franco-German negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily. It is said that there are no less than 1.8 million French prisoners in German hands. Only 100,000 are being released now, the number is not very large. Thus, in terms of numbers, this is equivalent to giving a hungry person a spoonful of soup. The announcement also stated that a systematic plan to repatriate certain types of prisoners of war is currently under study. In plain language, the Vichy government is now telling the public that everything the government does in its plans for domestic and foreign cooperation with Germany is in return for the repatriation of prisoners of war. Therefore, protests against Franco-German cooperation are directly turned away from the returning countrymen. The average Frenchman is now in a state of helpless laughter. The "Paris Times," representing French heavy industry, is now commenting on the recent developments in Franco-German relations with trust and approval. However, in Britain, there is great dissatisfaction with France, and the broadcast by Syrian Governor Dentz is even more infuriating. London newspapers are ashamed of France. The "Evening Standard" stated that Dentz listened to the German enemy seize Syria, and instead threatened Britain with force. Future Frenchmen will blush when reading this outrageous speech. There have never been more absurd remarks made by a puppet figure than this one. The French people do not approve of this loss, but what Vichy needs to know is that if Vichy transfers its national wealth, resources, and the products of its armaments factories to the enemy, Britain and the United States will not be able to excuse it and must take severe action to deal with this form of cooperation.

<p>London - Today, while the public's attention is focused on Germany's actions in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey, British diplomats said they had received news that French Deputy Premier Darlan and German Ambassador to Paris Abetz had already discussed the future of Dakar and Casablanca, important locations in West Africa. These said emphatically that Germany's greatest attention, not for Gibraltar, to for Dakar. These were also aware that Hitler's envoys were currently attempting to enlist Spain and France to cooperate with it in order to resist the United States in West Africa. (United Press, 20th)</p>

<p>Madrid - Former Spanish Republican Minister of War General Asensio said that the cabinet changes announced today mean that the time when Germany rules Spain is approaching. He said, "I am not surprised by this sudden change. I believe this is the Falangist Party's seizure of the government, and Germany's control of Spain has further progressed. This change is a step forward for the Nazi position in Spain." Franco has appointed the following new cabinet members: Treasury Secretary Brin, Agriculture Minister Rivera, Labor Minister Quilon, and Secretary of State and Falangist Party Secretary-General Diaz. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington - Marquis of Aquiar, the chief representative of the Spanish Catholic Royalist Party, said that he had reported to the US State Department that all Spanish consulates in the United States actually represent Germany, and that the Nazi Party of Germany, using the name of the Spanish Falangist Party, is extending its reach everywhere, secretly under the command of Berlin. Several ships of arms have already been shipped to Mexico and Chile. Since last November, two German mechanized divisions have passed through Spain to French Tunisia and Italian Libya, waiting for an opportunity to take action against Morocco. This opportunity will come when General Franco agrees to cooperate with Germany. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>London - According to non-British envoys from Madrid, the threat of German aggression against Spain has diminished, and most of the German troops stationed on the Franco-Spanish border have been transferred elsewhere. The Spanish ambassador to Germany, who is currently in Madrid, will be recalled because the ambassador opposes Foreign Minister Serrano Suner's completely pro-German policy. Spanish leader Franco carried out a purge of the Falangist Party and major government departments today, causing various speculations here that a restoration may occur in Spain. It has been learned that the Duke of Alba has been appointed as the Chairman of the House of Lords and is working hard to restore the monarchy. It is believed that the majority of British government leaders will support this action. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid - It was officially announced that an agreement had been reached between Spain and the Vatican to resolve various county cases. This agreement does not qualify as a treaty. Its main point is about the Holy See's appointment of western frontier bishops. (United Press, 20th)</p>

<p>Berlin: German official sources confirmed the sinking of the Egyptian ship "Sansom," which was carrying wartime contraband. The German Navy, according to capture laws, allowed the passengers and crew to board German ships before sinking the "Sansom." (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The government officially announced today that all crew members and passengers of the Egyptian ship "Sansom" have been rescued by a German ship. This announcement provides the first definitive news regarding the fate of those aboard the "Sansom." Among the 202 passengers, 142 were Americans, mostly volunteers for a relief team heading to aid the Free French forces in the Middle East. German sources state that these crew members and passengers are currently residing in a certain location within the occupied territories. They also stated that the ship was sunk in accordance with international blockade regulations due to the contraband it was carrying. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Times, in discussing the sinking of the Egyptian ship "Sansom" carrying American relief personnel to the Middle East, strongly condemned Germany's acts of piracy on the high seas. The newspaper commented, "Nazi pirates plunder everywhere and respect no flag." The US government repeatedly protested the cruel and indiscriminate violation of universally recognized principles of international law during the last Great War. The current German government has neither learned from the experiences of Admiral Tirpitz nor is willing to do so. (United Press, 27th)</p>

<p>Washington: Republican Congressman Case yesterday proposed in the House of Representatives that the United States should accept all French territories and properties in the Western Hemisphere.

The price could be paid from the $200 million stabilization fund. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday while receiving reporters that the United States has not conducted any discussions with other American nations regarding the occupation of French territories in the Western Hemisphere.

<p>The British and Italian navies engaged in a decisive battle in the Mediterranean on March 28th of this year. Regarding the battle, the American Christian Science Monitor published a radiogram from its special correspondent aboard the British Mediterranean Fleet flagship HMS Warspite. Here is the translation:</p>
<p>The British Mediterranean Fleet has long sought a decisive battle with the Italian fleet, but has had no opportunity. Until March 27th of this year, when British intelligence detected that the Italian fleet had departed from Cape Passero in southern Italy, divided into two groups, one in the south, including one battleship, and one in the north, including two battleships, each with multiple cruisers and destroyers. The British fleet immediately set sail from Alexandria on the decisive day, prepared to attack, while dispatching naval aircraft to search for the enemy.</p>
<p>That day, the flagship of the Italian southern fleet, the Littorio (35,000 tons, recently launched), was heavily damaged by an aerial torpedo launched by a British aircraft, reducing its maximum speed from 32 knots to 15 knots. Several other cruisers and destroyers were also hit by British bombers.</p>
<p>In the evening, the British fleet made formal contact with this Italian fleet in the waters west of Crete, Greece. At that time, the British flagship Warspite, Valiant, and Barham simultaneously opened fire with 15-inch guns, hitting and damaging the Italian cruisers Pola, Zara, and Fiume. British destroyers then launched torpedoes, sinking them one by one. At this point, the Italian fleet was in disarray, and another cruiser was hit by a shell and went missing. Several other destroyers were also heavily damaged and are presumed to have sunk.</p>
<p>After the battle, the British Admiralty announced that no British ships were sunk and no sailors were killed or injured. The Italian Navy Department acknowledged that the British Navy sank three cruisers, but claimed that one British cruiser was also sunk.</p>
<p>The detailed circumstances of the battle are described below:</p>
<p>On the upper deck of the British flagship HMS Warspite, a small number of officers were filled with tension. This tension was not the kind that could be felt on an ordinary night, but rather the excitement of the moment before battle.</p>
<p>It was not yet nine o'clock. They were talking to Admiral Cunningham, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, without even smoking. The entire fleet was shrouded in darkness. Admiral Cunningham was dignified, solemn, and unhurried, issuing only brief orders.</p>
<p>Everyone was fully aware of the current situation. British submarines had detected the Italian fleet on the 27th, sailing east from Cape Passero, northeast of Sicily. The British Mediterranean Fleet immediately departed from Alexandria and sailed to Suda Bay on Crete to lie in wait.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 28th, the cruiser HMS Orion detected that the enemy fleet had divided into north and south groups and was advancing through the waves. By evening, the main force of the British fleet was following the flagship HMS Warspite, sailing into the Ionian Sea, close to the predetermined battlefield. Several Greek fast warships also participated.</p>
<p>Italian destroyer in the situation of bomb rupture British Mediterranean Fleet The cause is Kerr Han</p>
<p>As night fell, the British fleet knew that it was now close to the enemy's southern group. The great battle that they had been longing for for months was about to begin in an instant.</p>
<p>The main force of the British fleet, HMS Warspite, the sister ship HMS Valiant (30,600 tons each, armed with 15-inch guns), and HMS Barham (35,100 tons, armed with 15-inch guns), advanced cautiously, with the destroyer fleet protecting them on both sides. Sailors were at their posts, searchlight operators were crouching behind the searchlights, signalmen were ready with their small lanterns, the cannons were ready to fire, auxiliary guns were loaded with illuminating shells, and the commanders were straining their eyes, searching for their targets.</p>
<p>Just after the nine o'clock bell, a dark shadow was glimpsed, but it was difficult to tell what it was. Perhaps it was the flagship of the enemy's southern group, the Vittorio Veneto (35,000 tons, armed with 15-inch guns). Admiral Cunningham gave the order.</p>
<p>By ten o'clock, the fleet was in formation. Twenty minutes later, a dark fleet appeared on the right, and at the same time, an enemy ship challenged from the left. Cunningham decided to abandon the isolated ship on the left and engage the enemy's main force, ordering the entire fleet to turn ninety degrees to the right.</p>
<p>As a result, the two fleets faced each other in a state of high alert. The enemy ships were so close that there was no need to fire illuminating shells.</p>
<p>The British destroyer HMS Greyhound quickly projected a beam of light into the enemy line, illuminating the third cruiser in the enemy line, the HMS Fiume. HMS Warspite saw clearly and suddenly opened fire with a broadside. The shells landed, and flames erupted at both ends of the enemy ship, and the rear observation tower collapsed and fell into the sea. HMS Warspite followed up with another broadside, and the Fiume caught fire and was crippled.</p>
<p>Having succeeded with the Fiume, Admiral Cunningham ordered the guns to be shifted to the second ship in the enemy line, the sister ship of the Fiume, the Zara. That ship was also hit and caught fire. The British ships then attacked their sister ship, the Pola. At one point, the Zara and Pola both hung white flags on both sides, requesting a truce. The enemy destroyers Corazzini and Maestrale then released smoke screens in an attempt to escape, but were also beaten to a pulp by the Barham.</p>
<p>At this moment, British searchlights discovered two other enemy destroyers, taking advantage of their superior position to launch torpedoes at the British ships. The British ships were not prepared, but fortunately, these torpedoes missed the British ships. Cunningham did not want the main force to be damaged, so he ordered the main ships to let the destroyers finish off the wounded enemy ships.</p>
<p>There were at least two squadrons of British destroyers, each with eight ships, each carrying about eight torpedoes, firing together, turning the sea into a world of torpedoes.</p>
<p>The naval battle ended at midnight. The Italian ships suffered heavy damage, and the northern group never entered the battle. Later, eight British reconnaissance planes flew over the battlefield and saw hundreds of Italian sailors sitting in lifeboats, fleeing in panic.</p>

<p>The main formal social banquet to celebrate the seventh annual Sino-American Trade Week, sponsored by the American community in Shanghai, is scheduled to take place today (the 21st) at noon. Prominent Chinese and American leaders and merchants in Shanghai will gather at the American Club for the customary Sino-American Trade Luncheon. Mr. Nichols, Acting President of the American Chamber of Commerce, American Commercial Counselor Mr. Jared, and many other guests will deliver speeches. In addition to members of the Chamber of Commerce, there will be a total of fifty special guests attending. American Merchant Marine Day is on Thursday. The American Chamber of Commerce will host a banquet at the American Club on that day to celebrate. Furthermore, a banquet to entertain Chinese students who continue to study in the United States will be held at noon on Friday at the American Club to foster camaraderie.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Special Significance of Trade Policy <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News editorial yesterday, titled "Business as Usual," stated that the annual celebration of Overseas Trade Week in the United States is of special significance to the American people and the people of all countries that have commercial relations with the United States. "This significance lies largely in the vast difference in the concepts of domestic and foreign policies between democratic and dictatorial countries. The three countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan seek to increase their strength and wealth through conquest and enslavement of others. The consistent policy already announced by the US government is to use trade as a tool for international engagement."</p>

<p>"Even as global conflicts rage on three continents today, the United States, both the government and its people, continues to follow the path established many years ago, aimed at increasing trade between nations in order to achieve reciprocal and equitable benefits, and to promote friendly relations through peaceful commercial engagement."</p>
<h3 id="e46">Over 1,500 Participating Organizations <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>"The success of Overseas Trade Week in the United States can be evidenced by the dramatic increase in the number of organizations participating in this week. In 1935, only 300 organizations participated in this activity; the following year, it increased to over 600; in 1937, over 1,000; in 1938, over 1,200; in 1939, over 1,500. Within the designated celebration week, there must be Merchant Marine Day on May 22, which is a holiday designated by the American Chamber of Commerce to commemorate the first American steamship, the Savannah, which sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in May 1819, setting sail from Savannah."</p>
<h3 id="e47">Sino-American Commerce Increasingly Important <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>"Recent trends in trade between China and the United States clearly demonstrate the importance of their commercial relationship. Although the situation is currently abnormal due to the Sino-Japanese War and the European turmoil, Sino-American trade continues to increase. Figures released by the US Department of Commerce reveal that in the first ten months of 1940, US imports from China increased by 60% compared to the previous year. During the same period, US exports to China were valued at US$62,908,000, compared to US$40,170,000 in the same period of the previous year."</p>
<h3 id="e48">Shanghai Achieves Prominent Position <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>"As for Shanghai, according to figures compiled by financial and commercial magazines, in 1940, Shanghai accounted for 21.30% of China's imports to the United States (compared to 15.94% in the previous year), and 28.63% of China's exports to the United States (compared to 21.92% in the previous year)."</p>
<h3 id="e49">US Exports to Japan Sharply Reduced <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>"Conversely, US trade with Japan has been forced to decline. In the first ten months of 1940, due to the European war, Japan increased its demand for US goods. However, after the implementation of export licensing controls on certain products, US exports to Japan sharply declined, and the gains made in the first ten months of that year were eliminated."</p>
<h3 id="e50">Looking Forward to Increasingly Harmonious Relations <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>"Given the current international situation, these factors will become increasingly important. International trade relies heavily on goodwill and engagement among the various peoples involved. In this regard, the situation is particularly favorable for the continuation and increasing harmony of trade relations between China and the United States. Shanghai's celebration of Trade Week will further enhance the already existing harmonious and mutually beneficial relationship between commercial representatives of the two great nations. All those in a position to do so should do everything in their power to ensure that the special program celebrating Sino-American Trade Week is a complete success, so as to focus greater attention on China's trade relations with the United States."</p>

<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening Post commented yesterday on the peace atmosphere being spread abroad, saying that aggressors are seeking opportunities to catch their breath and have recently been talking about peace. Newspapers in France, which are controlled by the Germans, believe that both sides in the European War are evenly matched and cannot claim victory, so they are asking President Roosevelt or the Pope to mediate the European War. At the same time, on the other side of the world, we hear that Tokyo wants to end the Sino-Japanese War, but it is very difficult to predict what kind of conditions it will propose and what attitude the United States will take in mediating. The intention of Tokyo is probably to ask the United States to mediate under the following conditions: (1) the Japanese army will withdraw from the interior of China; (2) the United States recognizes Japan's superior position in China; (3) Japan stops its southward advance; (4) Japan obtains various economic privileges and promises to attach importance to the southern part of Asia, and the United States will help with loans. At the same time, Tokyo's two major pro-Axis newspapers, such as the "Hochi Shimbun" and the "Kokumin Shimbun," advocate that Japan should prioritize its own interests and must not participate in the Axis war vortex, regardless of any actions by the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e55">China Cannot Accept It <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>China is a democratic country and must strive forward together with other truly democratic countries. Therefore, today, the Chinese people must clearly recognize that the above-mentioned solution to the Sino-Japanese War can cause China to suffer the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction. This proposal by the Japanese side, and the remarks of Hochi Shimbun and Kokumin Shimbun, are actually Japan's appeasement policy, and its future will suffer the same fate as the appeasement policies implemented elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="e56">This Proposal Has Other Ambitions <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>We all know that what Japan seeks is victory, not peace. Therefore, any work to negotiate peace with Japan that can fulfill Japan's desires is not true peace, but actually Japan's victory, giving it a chance to catch its breath. The democratic countries have all seen the results of the appeasement policy in Europe and Asia, that is, it did not bring peace, and it can be asserted that it will never come with peace. The only way to obtain true peace is definitely not from aggressors, and the current peace proposal is actually another manifestation of the aggressor's ambitions.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issued another notice yesterday regarding the sale of Hong Kong rice, stating that the Council believes that the Hong Kong rice currently available and that can be shipped in succession is sufficient to meet all the needs of the city. The temporary restrictions on the sale of rice stipulated in Notice No. 5457 should be lifted immediately. From now on, residents of the city may freely purchase this rice at any time for their own use. However, when this rice is sold to any buyer, if the quantity is one bag or more, the rice shop should issue an invoice stating the selling price, quantity, and the buyer's name and address. Each rice shop should also submit a copy of the invoice to the nearest police station for verification no later than the decisive day after the sale. It is hoped that citizens and rice shops can cooperate with the Council to avoid hoarding. It is rumored that the Council now requires all rice shops within the Settlement to sell Hong Kong rice.</p>
<p>Rumors of Rice Weevils Not Worth Paying Attention To</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rice weevils used the excuse of a Ningbo gang buying rice to increase the price of rice by several dollars again. A Datong reporter learned from the Zhejiang leaders in Shanghai yesterday that the so-called Ningbo gang is just a few people who came with 200,000 in cash, preparing to buy more than 1,000 bags of rice. Since the Ningbo retreat from the Four Banks to Longyou, 40 million in roving capital has followed the banks into the interior, so the rice shops with more specifications have insufficient capital turnover and are all insufficient to come. With the abundant rice reserves in Shanghai, the Ningbo gang's purchase of more than a thousand bags is like a drop in the ocean, what impact does it have on the entire rice market in Shanghai? It is actually borrowing the topic to play up, a donkey's trick, not worth laughing at. Therefore, yesterday the rice prices of various shops in the city dropped by four or five dollars.</p>
<p>Each Police Station Will Distribute Rice Samples</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, the Municipal Council's fair-price Hong Kong rice strictly prohibits retail rice shops from mixing other kinds of rice. It has now started to make hundreds of small bags of Hong Kong rice samples and distribute them to patrol officers in each police station to keep with them so that they can check at any time when the retail rice shops sell them to see if they match the original sample. It is said that these hundreds of bags of rice samples should be all made today and can be distributed to patrol officers immediately. If residents of this city find any rice shops mixing etc., they should also immediately report to the Municipal Council or Jardine Matheson and Ewo, and severely investigate and deal with them. Also, yesterday's Saigon No. 1 was priced at 112 yuan per stone, while the rice shops still sold it at 120 yuan. Attention should be paid to this phenomenon.</p>

<p>The Commercial Press's layoff plan has been officially implemented. Yesterday, many people in the museum received dismissal letters and registered with the co-workers' association. The situation is panicked. The labor side has tried to find food personnel for the funding side, but they have not met. The labor side went to the Municipal Council again to petition, but there was no way to do it. Now, the co-workers' association is continuing to negotiate with a positive method, and on the one hand, it is registering all the co-workers who have been cut off and transferred. The cultural circles of Shanghai are hoping that the labor-management dispute in the museum will be resolved as soon as possible, and they are hoping that the transferers will make a final effort.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the "Reduce Car Horn Noise Campaign." In addition to ordering all patrol officers in the city to work hard to investigate cars that honk their horns excessively on the streets and give them advice and corrections, the Traffic Office added staff yesterday to distribute leaflets to cars driving on the streets and appealed to all theaters in the city to assist in expanding publicity. Under the guidance of the authorities, more than 20,000 car owners and drivers in the city have gained a deep impression of the significance of this movement, so the noisy atmosphere that filled the city in the past has gradually been eliminated.</p>

<p>The officers of the Fourth Marine Regiment of the US Naval Forces stationed in Shanghai hosted a banquet at the "Mahjong Room" of the American Club from 6 to 8 PM last night (the 20th) to entertain the outgoing Commander Colonel Baker and his successor, Colonel Howard. Many guests from various circles attended to see off the old and welcome the new. Mr. Howard has already taken over the position of Commander. Mr. Baker's term of service has ended, and he will soon return to Washington, D.C. to take up a new position.</p>

<p>To the left of the main gate is the Tushanwan Printing House. Following the right hand side, circumventing the corridor, we passed through a bamboo fence gate. Inside was an immense plaza, and within the corridors on either side were rows of buildings. However, this vast courtyard was surprisingly tranquil and silent. Mr. Zhiyao first had to go to the chapel to recite scriptures. Although I am not Catholic, following the host's preference, I also went in and knelt beside him, admiring the solemn decorations within the chapel. Upon exiting, we immediately went to visit the院长 Father Lu Daomao. Father Lu had flowing silver hair and piercing eyes. Amidst his imposing demeanor shone an air of benevolence. After completing the admission procedures, accompanied by Father Lu, we first visited the painting section. Some were painting scenery, some were making drawings, and some were applying color to lantern slide negatives against the sunlight. In addition, the displayed artistic products, stained glass, were resplendent and colorful, too numerous to see all at once. Hanging on the wall were portraits of Matteo Ricci, who first came to China to preach, wearing Ming dynasty attire, and Johann Adam Schall von Bell and Ferdinand Verbiest, in Qing dynasty attire with red-tasseled hats and indigo jackets. These men made great contributions to introducing Western science into China. Going further in, passing through a waist gate, hung a plaque reading "Ciyun Elementary School," which is the school section of the orphanage. This three-story Western-style building was previously the residence where the centenarian Mr. Ma Xiangbo lived and wrote. It will have its commemorative value in the future. Now, the first and second floors have become classrooms for the orphans, and the third floor serves as a dormitory. We first walked through a classroom on the second floor, then went downstairs, and Father Lu introduced us to Principal Father Zhang Mengyu. Father Zhang is from Shandong and comes from a family of Catholics, so many of his relatives are monks and priests, Father Zhang being one of them. Father Zhang was radiant and kind, and although he had suffered from stomach problems and had undergone three surgeries, his health remained as usual. I firmly believe that those who truly practice monasticism must possess a great spirit. The rules of Catholic monasticism are very strict, renouncing beauty, wealth, and laziness. Therefore, when illness strikes, their spirit has its own comfort and reliance, not caring about the pain of the flesh. Not to mention Father Zhang, even my friend Xu Chunrong, who is a devout Buddhist, also had two resections for stomach ulcers, removing two palm-sized pieces, but it did not harm his health afterwards.</p>
<p>Another person joined us to visit. Passing through a large sports field, we entered through a bamboo fence amidst a row of plane trees, and there was a classroom that looked very simple on the outside but very clean inside. This is where the first graders study. Another building is their dormitory, with rows of small iron beds arranged neatly.</p>
<p>We also learned from Father Zhang that this orphanage has a history of eighty-six years. It was founded by Father Xue Kongzhao, back in the fifth year of Xianfeng (1855 AD). It was opened in Caijiawan, Qingpu, and was destroyed in the tenth year of Xianfeng (1860 AD), moving to Dongjiadu, Shanghai. In the second year of Tongzhi (1864 AD), it was finally located at its present site. The entire院 covers an area of sixty-three acres. In addition to classrooms and dormitories, there are sickrooms, bathrooms, covered playgrounds, laundry rooms, music rooms, and a grand auditorium, all fully equipped. In addition, there are three recreation fields with fresh air, needless to say.</p>
<p>All orphans over the age of six are admitted to the院, regardless of whether they are deaf, mute, or disabled. They are assigned to various grades according to their level. Elementary school is divided into six grades, and there is also one grade of junior high school and one grade of apprentice training. Deaf-mute students are in a combined class. Father Zhang also plans to establish a vocational high school for orphans in the near future to expand the orphans' employment prospects. To enter the院, one must fill out a guarantee. Once admitted, all clothing, food, accommodation, books, and all living necessities are provided by the院. There is one rice meal and two porridge meals per day, and meat twice a week, so the nutrition is very adequate. As for health, special attention is paid. In addition to epidemic prevention and vaccination, more serious illnesses are sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Students who perform well after completing six years of elementary school can continue their studies. Those who are less academically inclined are assigned to various self-established workshops to learn skills. After he can support himself, he is allowed to go out to work or stay in the院 to work. With such facilities, it deserves to be called a paradise for orphans!</p>

<p>Wang Zhenjiang, who resides at No. 18, No. 11 Yu Qiaqing Road, is engaged in the lighter business. In addition to marrying Ms. Pan as his wife, he also took Hong Qinxin as a concubine. Hong gave birth to a son named Yongsheng, who is now four years old. Because Wang has only this one son, he loves him very much. On the morning of March 24th of this year, at 8:00 AM, several robbers suddenly broke into Wang's home. One of them wore a black muzzle, resembling a Japanese person. They first robbed Wang of 2,000 法幣 and three rings worth hundreds of yuan. Before escaping, they kidnapped his son, Yongsheng.</p>
<p>Ransom of 300,000</p>
<p>After the incident, Wang received a ransom letter from the bandits, demanding 300,000 yuan. While negotiations were underway, Zhang Decai and Xue Youwen, Chinese detectives of the 老閘 Police Station, received a report from an informant. They arrested the suspects Mao Cheng, Shi Binghua, Chen Zhiyuan, Geng Bingzhang, Ma Xiufeng, Zhang Chuanming, Chen Huilin, Wu Tan, Zhang Fugeng, Shen Haiqing, Liu Jianwen, Shen Chen, Wang Youdi, Lu Xingguang, Shen Jinlong, Chen Yuanshou, Chen Yuzhang, Zhu Weizhang, Zhu Chi, Wu Er, Shi Meizhang, Wang Youfang, Zhang Ada, Lin Puqing, and Yu Zaiyu at No. 306 Xiaoyao Inn on Baliaoqiao Road, No. 15 Penglai Road in Nanshi, and No. 12 Tongan Lane in Shipinong, Nanshi. They seized a box cannon, two pistols, and fifteen bullets, and rescued the hostage. They were sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention.</p>
<p>Case Involving Romantic Affair</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, this case was heard in the first criminal court by Judge Xiao Xiefei. The defendants hired lawyers Jiang Baoli, Jiang Pingfan, Fan Gang, and Yu Enliang to defend them. First, the lawyer of the police station, Ru Bao Yi, stated the process of solving the case. Then, he described the investigation of the defendants' involvement in the case, saying, in brief, that the instigator of this case was actually a woman named Tang Jinfeng, who is still at large. It is reported that Ms. Tang and Wang Zhenjiang had a physical relationship, and Wang already had a wife and a concubine. The concubine, Hong Qinxin, even gave birth to a son, so there were bound to be differences in treatment. Tang held a grudge and thought to seize Hong's son, so as to shift Wang's love away from Hong, and also take this opportunity to extort a huge amount of money. Tang then discussed with the defendant Shi Meizhang. Shi invited several defendants on the case. Shi originally had a car with the license number 1406, which he had just sold to someone a few days before the crime, and the license number was also changed to 8966.</p>
<p>Internal Strife Among Accomplices</p>
<p>The car was sent to 同昌 Auto Repair Shop by the current owner for repairs. Since Shi had decided to commit the crime, he asked the current owner to borrow the car for use. The car owner did not suspect anything else and agreed to lend it. After the crime, Tang Jinfeng hid the hostage at her home at No. 282 Penglai Road. However, the accomplices who went to kidnap the person with Shi were afraid that Shi and Tang would benefit alone, so they reunited with Mao Cheng, Shi Bingzhang, Wu San, and Wu's wife, Tan, to devise a way to snatch the hostage and move him to Wu San's house at No. 12 Tongan Lane in Shipinong. Before a day had passed, the police solved the case. Therefore, the police station is now prosecuting the defendants for robbery, kidnapping, and extortion. After Judge Xiao questioned the plaintiff Wang Hongqin and the hostage Wang Yongsheng, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned to another date due to lack of time, and the defendants were sent back to jail.</p>

<p>At around 0:30 AM yesterday, three men armed with weapons broke into No. 485, next to Baoxing Lane on Avenue Dubail in the French Concession, and went straight to the attic on the fourth floor. They seized a resident and took him out of the door, disappearing without a trace. It was later learned that the kidnapped resident was named Li Kaiwen, a native of Beiping, 47 years old, and currently an employee of Yongmao Shenzhuang in Beiping. The store is located on 天主堂 Street. Li often travels back and forth between Beiping and Shanghai, and his monthly salary is only 40 yuan, but his side income is very rich, but it is not enough to qualify for kidnapping, so the case is very bizarre. The French police are currently investigating. It is reported that the men who kidnapped Li were wearing Zhongshan suits, and two wore black and gray long gowns, holding a pistol.</p>

<p>A shooting occurred in front of the entrance of the China Merchants Securities Exchange on Jiujiang Road in the Public Concession at about 1:45 PM yesterday. The victim was Zhao Gengfu, the manager of Xinyuan Gold Shop on the seventh floor of the Securities Exchange. He was shot twice in the right temple and died shortly after. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Important Gold Industry Official</p>
<p>Xinyuan Gold Shop is located in Room 503 on the seventh floor of the China Merchants Securities Exchange at No. 429 Jiujiang Road. Zhao Gengfu (32 years old) from Ningbo was hired as the manager. Zhao also served as a broker No. 3 in the Gold Exchange and the director of the General Affairs Section of the Gold Industry Association. His family lived on West Yanan Road, Lane 690, No. 3, and owned his own car with license number 823. At about 1:15 PM yesterday afternoon, Zhao walked out of the exchange.</p>
<p>Shooting Each Other</p>
<p>Just as he was about to step into the car, a 麻皮 person lurking nearby, over twenty years old, saw Zhao about to get into the car, and whispered to the assailant, "That's the one." The person quickly pulled out a box gun and fired two shots at Zhao, both hitting the right temple. Blood spurted out like a fountain, and Zhao collapsed, dying. At that time, a doorman in the exchange heard the gunshots and quickly took out his pistol and fired at the shooter. The shooter also fired two more shots to resist arrest, but all missed.</p>
<p>Clever Capture of the Assailant</p>
<p>Fortunately, the doorman was unusually alert and dodged successfully. He crouched next to Zhao's body, and the shooter, thinking that the doorman was also injured and had fallen to the ground, fled west with his weapon. The doorman saw the shooter moving forward and got up and chased after him, until Fujian Road, he had passed the shooter's front, and quickly turned back with a gun, pointing at his chest, forbidding him to move. At this time, the shooter saw the situation and could not resist, so he had to surrender. The street police were called and took him back to the 老閘 Police Station.</p>
<p>Died of Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Zhao Gengfu fell to the ground after being shot. The police on duty immediately called an ambulance to the scene and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the injuries were critical and the medication was ineffective. He died at about 3:10 PM. After the competent police station received the news, it immediately ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to investigate. As for the reason for the shooting, the police station is currently investigating. When reporters arrived, they saw bloodstains on the sidewalk, and broken glass from the car scattered all over the ground.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Grain: Can Dead Ashes Rekindle? The Rice Market Reverted to Small Yesterday; What Kind of Rice Is the Publicly Sold Rice? <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The 工部局 publicly sold rice currently sold in various rice shops seems to have a lot of broken rice. Is this phenomenon expected, estimated at 40 percent? It is unknown, but as for what kind of rice is the 工部局 publicly sold rice, outsiders only know that the reports are the same as the pure Xiaojiao rice they usually buy. However, without displaying the rice samples, there is no way to compare them. Everyone can eat rice, but everyone except those in the rice industry does not know rice. If the store says, "This is the 工部局 publicly sold rice," the rice buyer does not know, and the rice itself does not speak, so they can "call a deer a horse." The buyer has no choice but to remain silent. Therefore, it is most important to ensure that the rice sold does not deviate from the original, and to be careful to prevent inferior or mixed rice from being sold as 工部局 rice, causing the public to lose trust in 工部局 rice. On the other hand, if you want to buy better rice, you have to pay a high price. In fact, how do you know that this high-priced rice is not the real 工部局 publicly sold rice? It is not yet known whether this situation exists now, but if the 工部局 publicly sold rice does not give the public the opportunity to recognize, compare, and seriously check whether the rice sold by the store is the same as the original rice, it is inevitable that there will be abuses in the future. Don't think it's too early to say that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice was once raised due to the stimulus of 客化, but the bottom was full and to the end, the water feet decreased, the price was even lower, and people's hearts were weak, competing to spit it out. The 客帮辦裝 three or five thousand bags, it is difficult to control the market,况甬帮一辦即止,本街納胃更細,兼因市上和平谣諑更不利於貨方, therefore the opening price saw a straight-line plunge after being raised, especially the Xiaojiao was soft, the opening price was one hundred and eleven yuan, small to one hundred and four yuan, and it was suppressed by one or two yuan again in the afternoon, the Yinghua Si in April and May Xiaojiao fell to one hundred and twenty-eight yuan, still no recipient, and the mixed broken front opened at one hundred and five yuan yesterday, then from one hundred and one yuan, small to ninety-six yuan, a difference of up to nine yuan, and other futures were 678 yuan less, No. 1 西　from one hundred and thirty-eight yuan small to one hundred and thirty-five yuan, still lacking smooth changes, the afternoon closing situation was even softer, if there are unexpected events today and tomorrow enough to encourage the buying side, then the market price will inevitably fall sharply again. The turnover of spot rice throughout the day was less than 8,000 bags, and Yinghua Si had more than 1,000 tons.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai, and the 法輪 Albert Sarrant of 華綸 Manager, carrying rice from Saigon to Shanghai, arrived at the port at about 9:00 PM the night before and berthed at Hongkou Huashun Wharf. It carried 24,429 bags of foreign rice, and unloading began yesterday. (祖)</p>
<p>Although the national rice such as 厚薄粳 is not smooth, the貨主 intends to sell without松, and the market has not changed under the hold. It is estimated that Wuxi special rice is 135 yuan, Kunshan special rice is 1323 yuan, the large market is 131 yuan and 130 yuan, and the middle　 is 128 yuan. The early and late rice of Nangang high goods has not yet opened, only the middle关 goods opened at 129 yuan, secondly to 126 yuan and a half, and the original package is 132 yuan and 130 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice was originally in season, but the market has been falling all the way lately, which has made the 作客 feel chilled and dare not take action, and often feels tired and lifeless. Now that the way to go has suddenly become more lively, the market is slightly挺秀 one or two yuan, and the opening price of Hong Kong white yuan is 1112 yuan, and the local glutinous rice is 124 yuan and 120 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Powder Market Plummets <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The current foreign powder market is plummeting. Since it rose slightly the day before yesterday, due to the fall in rice prices and the strong peace atmosphere, when the gold exchange rate鬆, people's hearts are eager to go down, and the native guest　 sales, once moved, will be lazy. The residents see the bad situation, and they all strive to get rid of it first. The opening price of Jinlong brand Kanfen still stood at 29 yuan and 5 cents, and then gradually松 to 29 yuan and 1 cent. In the afternoon, it was even more unsustainable. Jinlong powder fell to 28 yuan and 8 cents at the close, only opening at 28 yuan and 6 cents. Meifen 炮轰 brand did not open in the morning, and the market later went from 29 yuan and 8 cents to 29 yuan and 23 cents, each falling by 78 cents compared to the previous day. In the context of abundant stocks and the rice price still looking small, the prospects for the market are still not optimistic.</p>
<p>Wheat market transactions are as quiet as ever. At present, the old wheat has already fallen, and the early　 is short of goods supply. Each factory is waiting for the new wheat to be listed before purchasing again. During this Qing檔 period, its transactions can be said to be unique. It is heard that the selling price of Gaodu wheat is about 456 yuan, and the market is also looking soft.</p>

<p>The Silver and Money Industry will be implemented from June</p>
<p>Since the silver and money industries in this city began to close on Saturday afternoons in January this year, the time for accepting notes has also been advanced accordingly. A part of the banks stipulates that notes must be deposited before 10:00 AM to be included in the account of the same day, and those that are overdue will be included in the account of the next week. Recently, the banking industry, in order to increase the circulation of notes and facilitate the acceptance and delivery of various industries, sent a letter to the silver and money industry associations, advocating the extension of the Saturday collection time. After deliberation by the silver and money industry associations and with the consent of the United Preparatory Committee of Banks, it was decided to implement the postponement from June.

<p>Yesterday, the market for soy bean cake and corn, under the combined influence of environmental atmosphere, affected trading sentiment, leading to panic selling and unloading of stockpiles, causing prices to plummet. Saigon corn suffered a severe drop of five yuan, and Dutch corn fell sharply by three yuan. Furthermore, futures bean cake first fell and then rose, before plummeting again, dropping seven jiao compared to the previous day. Towards the close of trading, there was some buying to cover short positions, so corn was pulled up by one yuan, and bean cake recovered a few jiao.

<h3 id="e78">Yarn and Cotton: Actual Sales Decline, Yarn Prices Plunge <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market has declined again, and the downward trend is particularly intense. In addition, exchange rates are trending higher, margin calls are decreasing, and actual transactions are quite slow. Demand for 20-count yarn is very sluggish, all due to the decline in yarn sales. However, the Hong Kong firms are slightly buying 10-count coarse yarn. As for imitation horse yarn, some of it is still in the form of dry warehouse receipts, and sentiment is stable. However, securities and gold firms, seeing the unfavorable environment and various rumors, are mostly going short and are exhausted. Therefore, the current lineup is characterized by intense contention between the bulls and the bears, but yarn sales are too sluggish, and some quarters expect a further decline to below 400 yuan. However, raw materials are not willing to loosen up significantly because factory costs are higher than before. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1465 yuan, and the low price was 1424 yuan. In early afternoon trading, it was 1417 yuan, but as margin calls recovered, it rose to 1438 yuan, but with bearish selling, it fell again to 1431 yuan. Today, 1350 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The opening of Double Horse yarn was still strong, because the bulls were numerous and unwilling to let go, with the opening price at 1463 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1465 yuan. However, with mediocre gold market opening prices, outside investors had unfavorable sentiments and started selling, causing the market to suddenly reverse and fall to 1452-3 yuan. After lingering there for a long time, news came that exchange rates were trending higher, and there were many rumors. Many scalpers emerged, and everyone sold, with heavy selling pressure, causing a direct plunge to 1428 yuan. According to the market, a certain major player unloaded 2000 bales. After this news spread, sentiment became even more fearful. The closing price was 1424 yuan. It is found that the half-day turnover totaled 11,070 bales. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below:</p>

<p>100 bales of American Penjamo No. 33</p>
<p>Further news, the foreign cotton trading of foreign firms in Shanghai is quite dull. In recent days, due to certain rumors, and the gradual decline in the yarn market, all parties seem to be taking a wait-and-see attitude and have no intention to purchase. Even the foreign spinning mills that directly purchase goods from overseas have virtually halted operations.</p>

<p>The factory cloth market continued its downward spiral yesterday, with a weak trend. Opening prices varied among different cloths. White cotton fine cloth fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per piece, coarse cloth and twill fell by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao. The price of bleached and dyed cloth was even more chaotic, falling by about 5 jiao. Transactions among fellow traders were scarce. Customer firms and local wholesale houses had weak purchasing appetite. Speculators tended to sell off their holdings. About 100 pieces of various cloths were traded in the local market. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang firms did not buy, and are temporarily delaying their purchases. Other firms also only made small purchases. On the 21st, 1900 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth fell even more sharply. Futures fine cloth on the exchange fell by as much as 1.5 yuan per piece. In the spot market, Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 47 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen, and Gentleman Serge at 1 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen 8 li. Later, due to the plunge in margin calls and cotton yarn, sentiment became very fearful, and selling pressure increased sharply, causing prices to fall in each round of trading. In the afternoon market, Dragon Head closed at 46 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, and Serge at 1 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen 5 li.</p>

<p>The tin market fluctuates from time to time, but ultimately, due to the lack of purchasing power from merchants in Hangzhou and Shaoxing, and sluggish transactions in the local market, market sentiment has turned quiet again. In addition, the supply of goods is slightly available and has not been interrupted. Furthermore, there is no shortage of spot goods from Hong Kong firms and speculative stockpilers, so the circulating supply has not been insufficient. As a result, industry sentiment has softened, and opening prices have also fallen. Yesterday, 99.75% purity tin was quoted at 4300 yuan, a drop of over 200 yuan compared to the previous days. In addition, prices for copper, lead, large bars of lead, large white lead blocks, TC purple copper ingots, etc., have mostly softened due to slow actual sales.</p>

Yesterday, the quoted price for the latest batch of Shin Kan squid reached 325 yuan, and the previous batch of old stock was quoted at 290 yuan. It is found that the latest batch of Shin Kan will have to wait until the autumn hot water goods before there is any product, and the sales period is still long, so the price is firm and constantly high.</p>

<p>2. Western paintings are divided into still life paintings (including flowers, fruits, models, etc.), figure paintings (including religious Jesus portraits, etc.), landscape paintings (including outdoor landscapes, etc.), and pattern paintings (including architectural models, advertising paintings, etc.).</p>
<p>The focal points of Chinese and Western paintings are completely different. Chinese painting is biased towards idealism and advocates freehand and expressive style. Therefore, there are landscapes with overlapping mountains and ridges, flowers and fruits that do not fall within the margins, and figure paintings with only a few strokes, emphasizing rhythm and expression, and containing poetic meaning. Western painting is different, and must be based on perspective, distance, light, color, and outline, without any deviation. However, the style of the recent post-impressionist school is closer to Chinese painting, and does not pay much attention to this mechanical method. As for tools, Chinese and Western paintings are also completely different. Chinese painting uses a brush and is painted on rice paper. Western painting uses pencils, pens, or brushes, and paints on pound paper, watercolor paper, and cloth. In terms of color, landscape painting in Chinese painting is relatively simple, with only ink, light ochre, cyan, green, and gold green colors. Flower and bird painting must be based on the original colors of various flowers and birds, and combined with them. The main ones are lead white, Prussian blue, stone blue, malachite green, gamboge, hematite, vermilion, carmine, and cinnabar, which are mixed and used at any time. Western painting colors can be divided into western red, scarlet, chrysanthemum yellow, lemon yellow, ultramarine blue, Prussian blue, grass green, dark green, burnt umber, and white powder, and are divided into water-based, oil-based, and powder-based categories, which are also mixed and used at any time. Chinese painting is divided into hall paintings, screen paintings, vertical paintings, album pages, and hand scrolls. The length of a hall painting is twice its width, the length of a screen painting is three times its width, and the length of a vertical painting is two or three times its width. Album pages are mostly one foot square, and hand scrolls are mostly one foot or more in height, and less than one and a half feet, and the width is not fixed. Hall paintings, screen paintings, and vertical paintings are convenient for hanging, and album pages and hand scrolls are convenient for collection. Hand scrolls are the most interesting, and they are viewed and rolled at the same time, giving a sense of being overwhelmed. The format of Western paintings has a length to width ratio of five to three, which is called the "golden ratio," regardless of whether it is horizontal or vertical.</p>
<p>Since the content of the picture is as described above, let's now discuss the method. Because Chinese painting emphasizes artistic conception and style, the brushwork must have variations in rise and fall, speed and slowness, and lightness and heaviness, turning and folding. Whether the shape is like or not is not important. Su Dongpo once said, "Discussing painting in terms of similarity is like living next to children." If the painting is too similar, it will be rigid and tasteless, close to craftsmen, and not suitable for appreciation. Therefore, to study Chinese painting, one must practice calligraphy. To practice calligraphy, one must copy inscriptions. With a foundation in calligraphy, learning to paint is less difficult. The ancients said, "Painting bamboo must also understand the eight methods." Calligraphy has eight methods: side, le, nu, qu, ce, lue, zhuo zhe, etc. These eight methods can often be applied to painting. Su Dongpo, Zhao Ziang, and Dong Qichang were all calligraphers and painters, which is a clear proof.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Regarding "Marriage Advertisements" -- I am Not Voluntarily Recommending Myself <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Yunzhan</p>
<p>Because I am an unmarried man, I am often drawn to the marriage advertisements of women in the newspapers. However, because of my own shallowness and incompetence, and at the same time, doubting the purpose of the seekers, I have never tried to be a respondent.</p>
<p>The reason is: the seekers despise the men they know around them, and seek unfamiliar men they have never met, so their vision is naturally superior. I know that I am a person without any special talents, and rather than respond and be sure to be rejected, why bother! Moreover, Shanghai is a place where talents gather. Since my wealth and talent are far inferior to others, it is better to hide my clumsiness.</p>
<p>At the same time, many men are seeking girlfriends and companions, and most of them are university graduates; as for their status, they are either in noble occupations or have considerable monthly income. Even such people are publishing advertisements to seek girlfriends and wives, which makes people feel more and more that it is difficult to find a spouse and that it is not easy to get a girlfriend.</p>
<p>Therefore, although there are many marriage advertisements for women, I am even more afraid to respond.</p>
<p>I don’t know whether they or they will have a perfect match and get an ideal spouse as a result of their solicitation.</p>
<p>"Those without sincerity, please do not try." This sentence is in almost every marriage advertisement, and the intention is of course to avoid the teasing of do-gooders, for example, men are afraid of homosexuals impersonating, and women are afraid of married men cheating. In fact, the so-called "please do not try" is fundamentally a contradiction, because the seeker cannot know in advance whether there will be a suitable opposite sex to respond, and the respondent cannot be sure whether he or she will be selected; and it is an extremely important issue whether the seeker meets the expectations of the respondent whom they think is a suitable candidate; you are seeking in an experimental way, and he or she is responding in an experimental way, the original intention of both parties is nothing more than trying, isn't it? The so-called "sincerity" does not seem to be very relevant, does it?</p>
<p>It is said that the second step of the seekers is like this, especially for women: after collecting the letters of the respondents from the mailbox, they will arrange a meeting with the suitable ones, as if to solicit business for tea rooms, parks, or hostels, and ask you to meet at a certain place at a certain time on that day. The address of their own residence is kept secret. However, in order to receive the seeker's reply, the respondent has to write down the real address. In this regard, the respondents are obviously more "sincere" than the seekers.</p>
<p>As for age, origin, resume, occupation, and family status, etc., the respondent cannot but fill in detail even if he or she is falsifying. However, the seeker can calmly "hide in the mailbox" and carefully review, which is really overbearing. Therefore, some people are unwilling to try even if they want to respond. Some, instead of responding, might as well become a seeker, who knows that spending a small amount of advertising fee is much safer.</p>
<p>In fact, I think that a truly sincere seeker should first truthfully publish his or her name, address, and all the details, and the result will definitely be more satisfactory and effective than borrowing a mailbox.</p>
<p>However, this is just saying, if I were a seeker, I'm afraid I couldn't do it either.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Two Kinds of Fleeting Figures <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Zhu</p>
<p>"Want money, don't want life" and "Recognize tickets, don't recognize people" are the two most popular kinds of people at the moment. — They are actually brothers in adversity.</p>
<p>The former was originally only a humble class, such as rickshaw pullers, hawkers, etc., who did not hesitate to show their spirit of exchanging their lives for it for a minute's dispute. Now, even scholars and officials are taking this as a standard. In order to scrape a few more sinful coins, not to mention ignoring everyone's life and death, they are even willing to sacrifice everything and be martyred for Confucius' brother!</p>
<p>The latter seems to be wearing a pair of glasses with red and green colored paper on them. What he can see is nothing but banknotes. Therefore, in his circle, he will never see friends, acquaintances, colleagues, etc. As long as he puts on a pair of glasses, he will happily go to do anything, such as digging up ancestral graves and stripping corpses!</p>
<p>Alas, hoarders and snobs!</p>
<h3 id="e97">"Threshold" <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>If someone wants to "live" in Shanghai, they should first understand the "threshold."</p>
<p>"Threshold" is "the art of living": "A refined 'threshold' leads to success in all walks of life; an unrefined 'threshold' always hits nails!"</p>
<p>People with clean sleeves, just climb a few climbs, drill a few drills, or cry a few cries are fine; then "in a blink of an eye," "old rooster" immediately becomes "duck." There is nothing "profound" or "skillful" about this, simply put "threshold"!</p>
<p>Perhaps naturally a "stupid坯," do not understand how to flatter, do not understand how to fawn, and do not understand this and that; then it is not uncommon for bumps to rise on the head, and it is also not "too much" to fall headfirst and break bones to pieces.</p>
<p>Therefore, in a nutshell, one needs to be "enthusiastic" about the "threshold," otherwise, one must "respect it like a Buddha and guard against it like a thief."</p>
<p>(This is also a "threshold"!)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Autumn Begonia <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) Tangible Friendship</p>
<p>Only two people remained in the sickroom.</p>
<p>"Just some knife wounds on your face shouldn't make your body so weak!" Yu Kun asked, standing in front of the bed. "Third Brother, did they do something else to you? If you have internal injuries, these foreign doctors won't be able to cure you at all!"</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia weakly shook his head, trying hard to reach out a hand to grasp Yu Kun's, but he had no strength at all.</p>
<p>"I'm not like you; after suffering this humiliation, my heart has been heavy..." He spoke with even greater difficulty, having to pause for breath after every three sentences. "And I keep worrying about her and Meibao, so... in these past few days... I haven't been able to sleep soundly or eat anything..."</p>
<p>Yu Kun forced a smile, seemingly unimpressed.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, you guys worry about such things unnecessarily!" In his worldview, drinking was probably the most important thing in life. "Now you've suffered hardships and can't even rest in the hospital, worrying about others all day long. Well, let me tell you! Meibao's illness was quite serious at first, but in the past few days, she's back to jumping and laughing, like a little white dog."</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia listened attentively, lost in thought, and at the same time, he noticed a miracle on Yu Kun's face... This martial artist, who used to be as nimble as a thief, had never shown any interest in children. Even though he often went with Autumn Begonia to their home and even went alone to take care of the household, he would only smile at Meibao. ——(一一一)</p>
<h3 id="e99">A Feast Without Rice <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Zimang</p>
<p>In the ×× Restaurant, in the ×× Grand Hotel, in the ×× Tea House, every day, under the glaring lights, extravagant feasts without rice are laid out.</p>
<p>On round tables with silver-rimmed cups and saucers, ivory chopsticks, beaming faces are reflected.</p>
<p>They crack melon seeds, grab almonds, and sip Yuqian tea.</p>
<p>After a while, when the guests have all arrived, the host orders the feast to begin. After a few dishes, a bowl of "Clear Broth Shark Fin" served in a "Royal Product" from some kiln or another is presented first. The host is the first to raise his silver spoon, followed by a chorus of clinking sounds, but suddenly, it is suppressed by an elderly gentleman in a dark silk jacket with a团花 pattern:</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Yuan, I'm so sorry, there's another banquet at the Taozui Restaurant across the street, please excuse my early departure!"</p>
<p>After the shark fin comes stir-fried shrimp, fried salmon, spicy chicken, and other hot dishes, which the host and guests devour with gusto. Inevitably, "singers and dancers" are called for, so slips of paper are passed around "calling for girls," and those who love "modernity" make a phone call to a guide service to summon a "flower guide" to sing "When Will You Return" or perform "Rose Rose I Love You"...</p>
<p>Next are the "Six Big Dishes"—six animal carcasses, mostly chicken and duck, are displayed, but the most interesting is a roasted, reddish-brown pork knuckle.</p>
<p>Of course, I have missed out on three or four types of snacks. "After the Six Big Dishes," some guests are already drinking tea and smoking "Three Bastions." Some, however, only drink a few sips of clear chicken broth, said to cleanse the overly oily and full stomachs.</p>
<p>While eating, they engage in a good deal of conversation, but there's no need to record it. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into two categories: one is spontaneous banter, and the other is "serious" talk about "long" and "short" positions, and "newly issued" deals...</p>
<p>Eating time—three and a half hours.</p>
<p>In the food eaten, there is no main food—rice, rarely seen.</p>
<p>So when discussing the rice problem, these people eating a feast without rice are not included, especially the "renowned people" who eat shark fin as rice.</p>
<p>But some say that many guests who often appear at such banquets have a "relationship" with sacks of rice, but don't wrong "good people." This is "circulation" for "the people's food," as evidenced by the feast without rice. This is precisely the "good intention" of leaving the rice for the poor to eat.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Elegy for the Late Madam Dao <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Xiexiong</p>
<p>Madam, surnamed Dao, given name Liangying, was from Zhenjiang and was the niece of the renowned educator Mr. Dao Jinzhi. She had little schooling but was naturally kind and sincere. She married into our family in the winter of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). All her relatives and clansmen praised her for her virtue and filial piety. In the winter of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), Zhenjiang suffered from the ravages of war. A bomb destroyed our house, and the family all fled. Afterward, only my mother was missing. Madam searched repeatedly among the ruins and collapsed walls, crying out as she looked for her, and eventually found her. People regarded it as an act of filial devotion. The following year, she escorted my mother to Shanghai. Madam became ill and died after three months of illness, on the 19th day of the fourth month. She was only thirty-two years old. Recalling the past, a hundred emotions arise. I compose this elegy to mourn her:</p>
<p>I regret that Heaven's heart is so cruel, bringing misfortune upon my house. I am ashamed that my insignificant self is unworthy, bringing endless harm to the virtuous. Only Madam was virtuous and gentle, continuing the harmonious life of husband and wife. I hear the praise from my parents, saying that her filial piety and virtue are clearly manifested. Her virtuous conduct is worthy of record, and her ability to adapt to circumstances is exceptional. In the year of Dingchou (1937), war brought disaster, burying my loving mother in the ruins of the wall. The filial daughter-in-law cried out, her sincerity moving even Heaven. Sifting through the broken bricks and shattered tiles, she found my kind mother in her sleep. Rejoicing at the old woman's safety, she was overjoyed to the point of tears. The story spread among the clansmen, and her virtue was praised in the neighborhoods. Why does Heaven not bless the good, instead of shortening their lifespan? Remembering the virtuous deeds of my departed one, we once shared joy in simple fare. She was able to endure poverty and remain humble, not admiring outward adornment. Alas, great Heaven is not merciful, afflicting such virtuous people. I hate the destruction brought by the two battles, and I grieve that medicine was ineffective. In the bright beauty of the third month of spring, the wind and sun were tragically darkened. I mourn the death of Madam, her form vanishing with the grass and trees. I believe that Madam is not dead, her name will last forever in the annals of history.</p>

<h3 id="e101">On Ticket Prices of Shanghai Movie Theaters <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Shanghai movie theaters, according to their nature, can be divided into three types: one is dedicated to showing domestic films, another is dedicated to showing Western films, and the third shows both Chinese and foreign films. In addition, there are the most common first-run, second-run, and third-run theaters. Most third-run theaters can be included in the category of theaters showing both Chinese and foreign films. Now, based on these two classification methods, let me talk about the ticket prices set by various theaters, which movie fans can use as a guide for watching movies.</p>
<p>Let's start with the theaters that only show Western films. The ticket prices for the first-run theaters, such as Grand Cathay, Cathay, Grand China, Nanjing, and Great Shanghai, are all the same, with the lowest being one dollar and fifty cents, a two-and-a-half-fold increase compared to pre-war prices. The ticket prices are different on weekends and weekdays. There are also slight differences between the two matinee shows and the evening show. These four theaters have no special provisions for children. Nanjing canceled them after the war. The ticket prices at Great Shanghai are between first-run and second-run theaters, but when showing a first-run film, it raises its ticket prices to the same level as Grand Cathay. The second-run theaters include Paris, Golden Gate, Guanglu, Lido, and Ping'an. Except for Lido, which sets separate ticket prices for children, the others generally have three price levels: eighty cents, one dollar and one cent, and one dollar and three cents.</p>
<p>Originally, there were five theaters dedicated to showing first-run domestic films: Jincheng, Guolian, Xinguang, Jindu, and Huguang. Originally, Guolian had the lowest ticket prices. Recently, Guolian has aligned its ticket prices with the other theaters, while Jindu has lowered its prices to be similar to Great Shanghai. They have a feature that first-run Western film theaters do not have: every Sunday morning, they add an early show and lower the ticket prices accordingly, especially Huguang, which gives special discounts to children. However, this discount is only available for the Sunday morning show, which some say is a flaw. There are only two theaters dedicated to showing second-run domestic films: Central and Yameng, with the lowest ticket price being sixty cents.</p>
<p>Currently, the most numerous theaters in Shanghai are the third-run and fourth-run theaters that show both Chinese and foreign films, and the ticket prices set by these theaters are also the most complex. After analysis, most are between forty and fifty cents, but Dumei and Lafayette are more expensive. Dumei sometimes shows first-run Soviet films.</p>
<p>In summary, the lowest ticket price for official movie theaters in Shanghai is forty cents, and the highest is nearly six dollars. However, if the Public Works Department implements an entertainment tax, I believe ticket prices will also increase accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Movie Star Life: Recalling the Past of Diao Banhu <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— You Ling</p>
<p>When Master Diao lived in Qingyun Lane, Yuyuan Road, I and others were tenants in the same building, so I know a thing or two about his affairs, but they are all trivial matters. Now I will tell them to those who care about Master Diao:</p>
<p>Cleaning Movement Master Diao's real name is Wu, and his family all call him Mingxiang. Because his appearance resembled Hu Die, he was often surrounded by photographers, which he found very annoying. The elegant nickname "Star Photo" also originated from this. When he first moved into Qingyun Lane, Lili Li was his only close friend, and she often visited him, sometimes helping with cleaning. Lili Li was strong and healthy, and she did the heavy work, such as mopping the floor, while he wiped the chairs and brushed the windows, every three or four days.</p>
<p>Tenants Helping Out One night without a show, he talked to me and others about his childhood experiences with ghosts. He said: "When I was young, I went to Longhua with my father in a carriage, and on the way I saw a ghost under the wheels, headless, which terrified me, but my father remained calm." That night, we talked until about twelve o'clock, and he dared not go to his room to sleep alone, insisting that I stay with him until dawn. At that time, because he was so popular, he was also busy with social engagements, so he entrusted all the trivial matters at home to the co-resident tenants or the maid of the landlord, such as not locking the door when going out, and not putting away the swimsuit after drying it, all of which were done by the tenants.</p>
<p>Threatened Engagement After a few months, a Mr. Chen with a pockmarked face pursued him fiercely, but he ignored him. One day, Mr. Chen invited him under a false name. He went, and later learned that it was Chen. Chen insisted on returning, Chen blocked him and used various threats to force him to sign an engagement. Fortunately, he coaxed Chen and returned. Not long after, I heard that he married a certain gentleman (name forgotten) and lived in Model Village. When he was about to leave, he invited me and others to visit, but unfortunately, we never went. One day, three or four female students broke into the house to ask for autographed photos. At that time, there was a shortage of photos, so he politely declined. The female students refused to leave, and some even looked like they were crying and begging bitterly. When we saw it, we couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>Post-War Situation When the war started, I heard that a certain gentleman had lost his eyesight. He went to Hong Kong, and it was rumored that he had remarried that gentleman. I don't know what the truth is. Later, he returned to Shanghai and joined Yihua, filming "Yan Xijiao" and "Wang Baochuan," etc., but he was unsuccessful and contracted lung disease and was "suspended from duty." He is still in convalescence. I heard that his recent situation is very miserable. Alas! The end of an artist is like this, and I can't help but sigh for him. I sincerely hope that Master Diao will recover his health soon, continue to work hard, and bury himself in his work, so that his future may still be promising.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Summary of The Philosophy of Diligent Practice <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>A harmonious collective is bound to be full of vitality. Everyone regards the survival of the collective as supreme and the struggle of the collective as primary. When the supreme is the same and the primary is the same, the centripetal force is very strong, and they can share weal and woe together.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>(8) Tangible Friendship</p>
<p>The waters on the mountain are very clear. Between the cliffs, there are waterfalls like inverted pearl curtains flowing on the rocks, making sounds like the striking of gold and jade. This is another scenic spot on Mount Weifeng. At sunset, the two returned to the cottage. Liu Yining's aunt had already cooked several dishes to entertain the guest. When it was dark, the little maid brought in a lamp, and the two sat face to face in the study drinking wine. On the table were dishes of chicken and meat. Xu Jing looked at them and said to Liu Yining, "A traveler in a foreign land is fortunate to borrow a thatched roof to shelter from the wind and rain. But to be so hospitably treated by the host, killing a chicken to make millet, is truly too much." Liu Yining said, "There is nothing to entertain you here but mountain delicacies. Please allow me to offer you a few cups of white wine." As he spoke, he poured wine for Xu Jing. Xu Jing held the wine cup, thanked him, and drank the cup in one gulp. He said, "Wine and dishes are rare, but I am troubling you too much as a guest." Seeing that Liu Yining had little wine in his cup, he picked up the blue wine pot and filled it for him, saying, "Please, Brother Liu, also drink a cup." Liu Yining smiled and said, "I can't handle much wine, I have a small capacity, let me drink half a cup." After speaking, he raised his wine cup to his lips, drank half of it, and then picked up the wine pot and filled Xu Jing's cup. Xu Jing drank another cup clean. Xu Jing could drink well, but Liu Yining could not. After being persuaded to drink more than a cup by Xu Jing, his cheeks were flushed, and they looked red like apples under the lamplight, making him even more charming. Xu Jing looked at him, thinking to himself, "Mencius said that those who do not know that Zidu is beautiful are blind." Although Liu Yining is a man, his appearance is as beautiful as a woman. Li Xin and I, in our hometown of Qixian, could be called handsome men, but now, compared to Liu Yining, I can't help but feel inferior in front of such a gem." Liu Yining saw Xu Jing staring at him and smiled, saying, "I am not good at drinking, please drink more, Brother Xu." At this time, Xu Jing's Red Phoenix sword had been removed and placed aside. Liu Yining suddenly caught sight of it and said to Xu Jing, "I see that the sword you use is no ordinary thing. May I have the honor of examining it?" Xu Jing hurriedly picked it up, offered it with both hands, and said, "This thing is very ordinary, please don't laugh." Liu Yining took it, and with a "whoosh," drew it from its sheath. A cold light flashed, illuminating the four walls. The sword light flickered like purple lightning. Liu Yining stroked it and praised, "Good sword, good sword! Is it an heirloom?" Xu Jing then roughly told him how he had discovered the sword aura in the countryside and dug it up in the river. Liu Yining said, "In that case, this is a gift from Heaven to you. I hope you will use it well in the future and not disgrace this sword." Xu Jing said, "I respectfully accept your advice, Brother Liu." Liu Yining then re-sheathed the sword and returned it to Xu Jing. (六八)</p>

<p>(6) Ma Fulu</p>
<p>Because Xiao Changhua rarely performs on stage, Ma Fulu has become the darling of the clowns. Ma first entered the Mingshenghe class to study the old female roles. Before his art was completed, the class was disbanded. He then joined the Fuliangcheng class, learning the old female roles from Xiao Changhua, and later changed to clown roles. His voice is high and clear, and his recitations are clear and bright, making him the crown of the clowns of Fuliangcheng. He repeatedly followed Gou Huisheng and Ma Lianliang to the south, and was extremely popular among the people of the South. He excels in the plays "Examining the Head and Stabbing Tang," "Qingdingzhu," "Losing the Seal and Rescuing the Fire," "Little Shepherd Boy," "Famen Temple," and "Heroes' Gathering," "Ma Siyuan," and "Double Nail Record." In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Tianjin Business Daily launched an election for the "Clown Emperor," and Fulu received the most votes and was elected, and his name became more prominent. He has an older brother who studies acting. Ma Shixiao, the painted-face actor who is currently affiliated with the Carlton, is the son of Fulu's older brother. Ma has no hobbies and is good at managing money. He has accumulated a lot of real estate in the old capital with his artistic income. Ma Fulu is the only clown to wear a diamond ring on stage. (Preview: Ma Yunliang will be published this Saturday.)</p>
