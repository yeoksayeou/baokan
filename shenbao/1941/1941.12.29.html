<p>— 土土</p>
<p>上海是祇認衣衫不認人的，冬衣斷擋，不容你不想辦法，單穿了上裝而沒有冬大衣，跑出去就不體面，人家當着面雖不會奚落，但背後却難免譏笑一番，洋鐵罐頭之尊號，就無法避免。看看路上行人，背上都已有了大衣，心中就老大的不是，影院中的銀幕廣吿每次吿訴人：“Thme　To　Think　About　Overcoat”實在，眼不曾花，體覺上也已感到是添置大衣的時候了。</p>
<p>由於蕩馬路的經騐，那一家店舖裏有那一種自己所歡喜的東西，是牢繫在記憶中的，以便一旦錢在手的時候，可以一索而得，於是在窮兇極惡的情形下，設法到了一筆錢，向心頭早已暗契的店舖跑去。</p>
<p>霞飛路朿首鱗次櫛比的舊貨店，早已有過我無數次的足跡，櫥窗的的躑躅，標價的默記，都是重複至冉。這番舊地重臨，口袋中又有了一百幾十元錢，膽就陡然壯了起來，伙計上來招呼時，覺得目己確是一面孔大買主的神氣。跑進店堂，伙計正在翻櫥倒窗，選擇賣品，利用這空餘時間，向別的買客和伙計注視，見一個頭有菲列賓式香蕉的小伙子，正在付定洋，計三百元正，偷瞧一下定單，計大衣一件，雨衣一件，舊西裝一套，三共一千一百元正，數目凌人，身子立時矮了半截，舌頭不期然述仲二下，心也頓刻軟了下來，打定主意，沒有便宜貨不買也罷</p>
<p>伙計已把各式大衣放在玻櫃上，共是三件，一件藏靑厚呢的，索價二百八十元；灰色頭髮呢的五百六十元：火姆斯本秋冬二用的三百八十元。當時不置可否，儘管研究質地，結果，全新的價最廉，最舊的價最昂，所謂大衣呢，摸上去竟像棉織品，即使討價還價，給你如願以償，對折計算，也需一百四十元，席捲衣袋中所有，還是不足，貨品　看不中，本錢又够不到，祇好　聲對不起，揚長而別，因為沒有回頭，不知道伙計表情如何。</p>
<p>連跑幾家，祇在一旁聽他人討價還價，平心靜氣一加觀察，自己所有，祇能買一件包車夫穿的方格子舊大衣，於是賭氣索性不再流連，跳上三等電車回老家。妻的病正在加劇，這筆錢就義不容辭作了她的醫藥費，對病人呆坐了一會，穿了舊駝絨長袍，依然故我，去度剪刀槳糊生活。</p>
<p>新衣於我無緣，舊衣竟也如此高攀不起，就讓斯文暫時掃地吧！是為記。新夢</p>
<h3 id="c46">遣散的一天 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 新麥</p>
<p>我有一位朋友，他在××中學担任敎職，因為這學校下學期不預備再辦，所以在十二月的中旬，某天上午，由校長召集，舉行敎職員會議。事前早已傳出消息，一般敎職員出席的時候，面上都帶有不豫的色彩，因為月薪能否拿到是一個問題，下學期的失業又成了問題。</p>
<p>那天除集會外，校長更備了四桌酒席，菜餚是相當豐富，據說每桌的代價是二百元。然而人到齊了，校長起立報吿時，使全體敎職員倒抽一口氣的，便是那校長一開頭，就說因為校中所收學費，已完全還去債款，所以薪水不能發足，十二月份祇發半月，一月份無辦法。這樣每一個敎師少拿了一個半月的薪水，眞使全體職員面面相覷，啼笑皆非！</p>
<p>校長又繼續說，否則下學期續辦的話，經濟方面，當然有法可想，現在不預備辦下去，就不能再向人借錢。到了學期結束，已沒有餘款，開支方面，又要向人暫借，其他的事情都可想法，惟有錢是沒辦法的。</p>
<p>全體的敎職員無言的默默，這天的菜席雖好，吃進去也好像沒有什麽味道了。我的朋友終於立起來講話了：[我們別的無話可說，祇覺得今天所備二百元一席酒是不須有的，不如把這八百元酒席費分給我們，倒實惠得多，不管每人五元，十元，苦敎師在這個日子，當然多拿到一文好一文，不知校長作何感想？」這個質問的確帶些悽慘，而那校長自然找不出恰當的話來對答……</p>
<p>錢旣然沒有辦法，當然無話可說。吃好了酒，全體敎師職員無可奈何，打校長手裏拿了半個月薪水，大家走散，並深深的感到這遣散的一天太悽慘了，人家都有遣散費可拿，苦敎師連應當拿的薪水，還少了一個半月呢！</p>
<h3 id="c47">談談「找頭」問題 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 斯華</p>
<p>聽見不少人談起，電車上的「找頭」，現在是無形中沒有了，談的人倒不一定捨不了三二分錢，而於事後懊喪。實在，這是値得提出的社會上習見而應加改革的間題。筆者屢次從新世界搭東行電車至拋球塲，票價為一角二分，以前給賣票員一角五分，一因人擠，二因下車匆匆，他旣不給找頭，也就無暇與之計較，今天乘車時給他二角，照理七分不找，五分總得找來，下車前給他一個眼風，他竟道聲「對不起，沒有另找」了事。這才覺得這種惡習已日趨嚴重了。</p>
<p>售票員自鬧過揩油人命案後，此風雖未全戢，總算已略見澄淸，現在這種藉口沒有分頭，不與另找的變相揩汕則正方興未艾，這種惡習，雖不是全體賣票員都染有，但事實是極明顯和普遍的。乘客中的大部份都不願為了幾分錢而與賣票計較，即與之計較，對方也竟振振有詞，逈異揩油風度，弄巧反引起衝突，延誤行程，遂造成了「無形中取消找頭」的局面，甚至，査票員經人責問時都會置之不理，表示他也無能為力，乘客就吃虧些吧！</p>
<p>揩油是不道德行為，不給找頭也是不道德行為，決不能因分頭缺乏為理由邀人同情。默許售票昌揩油，等於幫助售票員長成不道德行為；默許售票員免去找頭，何嘗不是變態的幫手。乘客應儘可能於事先預備分頭，照價購票，否則，遇不給找頭時，也應向之索取，非實在我不出，不能默許售票員免去。電車公司當局對此種事實於最短期內應加以調查和改革，如重新發行代價券，也未始不是補救辦法，想此建議，必能獲得乘客的同情，而希望能迅速實行。</p>
<h3 id="c48">房租糾紛 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 有椎</p>
<p>上海的房租糾紛，本是現實的社會大問題之一。好些大房東予取予求，二房東狐假虎威，忝為三房客的小民頗有無立椎地之痛。但目前呢，人口遣散者有之，無法繳納偌大租金者有之，什麼辦呢？一聲霹靂，工部局煌煌佈吿：「……丁茲時艱，一般業主……索取到期應付之租金時，務必盡量以合理之態度處之，倘屬司能，應由業主准其展期付租，或暫時减租……」同時法租界總領事也有同樣的佈吿。這實在處理得好，使民衆减輕喘息不少；說句老實話，要是房祖付得起，和業主甚之二房東之間的感情尙無不合，不致便會少些；然而可惜的是：有些業主正在眼睛發紅，為了要老房客「小費」，多出二三倍房租而在交涉中者，現在不妨歇歇力罷。</p>

<h3 id="c50">徵文揭曉之十二兒戲戀愛 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 新衡</p>
<p>慈愛的確不是兒戲的，這由我自己不幸的遭遇更加證實了。</p>
<p>我的家庭在近年來由於爸爸的敢於冒險而暴發了，他老人家大腹便便的從長掛子一變為洋裝革履。我就是他第二個女兒，姊姊早年由父親配給他手下一位分行經理，家裏一位嬌貴妹妹是姨媽的，（南方人稱爸爸的姨太太叫「姨媽」。）我的胞妹則陪媽媽困居鄕下，哥哥已有一對小女孩，每天總要吵着跟我那孿生弟弟上學。姨媽「照例」不疼愛我的，幸而我出世時正是父親發財的開始，爸爸迷信於這種恰巧的運氣，祝我為「招財童子」的掌珠我，姨媽為施行爭寵的手段，在平時總不敢作過份明顯的岐視。</p>
<p>相安無事地過了幾年，我平靜地念書。一直到十五歲那年，我突然漸漸覺得似乎需要着甚麽的飢渴，又加以得不到慈母之愛，所以不由地，對於學校中一位男同學的追求，深深地受寵若驚！我由臉紅耳赤漸漸望愛河沉迷。學校當局碍於仙家與我家是有力校董，竟也不干涉我們，　我們無所忌諱地扮演着幼稚的玩意，沉迷着不可自拔，結果父親就為我們訂婚了。</p>
<p>我深深作若干次回憶，考問自己當時可就眞的愛了他而與他變愛？眼淚濕透了手帕，鼻孔抽酸了發紅，我肯定地承認我當時的確愛着他，但也的確只是　愛一個洋囡囡的小女孩。誰也不會否認：個人生長，雖然曾經在嬰孩時期愛過奶子，在兒童時期又愛着洋囡囡，但一到成年了，總不能再愛奶子與洋囡囡的。今天的我，所以對昔時那位他淡了起來，委實是囚為大演進化，而絕非見異思遷。</p>
<p>不是我有意挖苦他，更不是我硬把他低貶為洋囡囡。原因有：</p>
<p>㈠他的家庭非常複雜，靠「也是」暴發戶的爸爸一手養了若干個不住在一起的媽媽。</p>
<p>㈡他本人雖忠厚，但不好學，思想幼稚，痴痴地只會給我甜蜜的情書，而從沒一字半句勉勵話。</p>
<p>㈢當時訂婚，彼此家長皆因「他倆業已中意」的「旣成事實」，乃勉强定聘。（聞他要求其父向我家求婚時，他父親曾斥他年幼無知。）</p>
<p>㈣他是一位他叫庶母的螟蛉子，甚不得他家人好感，時因受虧，輒慫恿我跟他作消極方法的「不了了之出走。</p>
<p>㈤縱我眞的與他結婚，自審我必不慣於彼，那複雜的家庭生活，自己難過不談，恐或要因他之愛我。而越使加重他與家庭間之磨擦。</p>
<p>明年我打算升大學，我不願因此未決懸案而把我預備功課的腦子攪擾。希望賢明的編輯先生和經騐的讀者諸君，啓示我安全的綠燈。</p>
<p>編者按照新衡女士所叙述的家庭，的確不是幸福的源泉，然而她所列出的五個問題，都不能成為解除婚約的理由，並且還顯出了她沒有對着自己的婚姻，播下幸運　種子。第一她要認淸所嫁的不是他的家庭而是他，她不應該對他失望而應該去指示他，吿訴他怎樣上進，如果她的智力比他强。一個女孩子曾為她的洋因囡做小衣服，想像地使她的洋囡囡滿意，一個成年的女子，為什麼不可以充實她的洋囡囡的心靈而使他進步。即使他已經生了白鬍子，她也可以像保護一個洋囡囡似地去愛護他。在自己並沒有盡到最後的努力之前，決不要使希望的嫩芽消滅，而且有許多成功的人物，都應該把他們成功的原因，記在他們的妻子的賬上呢。我希望新衡女士加倍努力去培植個未來的偉大人物。</p>

<p>如果你正在戀愛期，或者　結婚以後，你就問以從下列的問題中，實驗出你終究是否愛他。</p>
<p>，你們在一塊見的時候，是否感覺　被此相距的快樂？</p>
<p>二，你們喜歡在一處做同一的工作嗎？三你們在爭吵以此以後，是否立　言歸於好？這些爭吵是不是無　緊要的事情。</p>
<p>四，你對他願意讓步嗎？你能夠忘記或寬恕他的缺點嗎？</p>
<p>五，他在一般男人之中，是否能夠有鶴立雞群電可能？</p>
<p>六，你有他在一柑橘得精神方面給興奮得多嗎</p>
<p>這些問題的答案，就可以吿訴你是否愛他。</p>
<p>家庭信箱</p>
<p>金華女士：來函已轉交助學金部份，請勿念。</p>
<p>德麟先生：像你一般的痛苦，是很普通的，有計多做丈夫的，覺得他們的妻子愛好虛榮，濫用金錢，亳無辦法。德麟先生，你可以把你的痛苦，解釋給你的妻子聽，然而同時你得力求進步，因為每一個人是生活在希望上的，如果沒有進步的希望，你就要缺少人生的興趣了。初中一年級的根底並不能成為你地步的障碍，有許多成功的偉人，根本沒有進過學校呢。</p>
<p>一澄秋先生：大家庭的臭惡和複雜，到了現在，已經不必多說了，你的父　的思想，是一般大家庭主人的傳統思想，握住了家產不肯放。然而你沒有說明你多少年齡，受過什麽敎育，為什麼沒有職業，我認為要靠一點家產來維持生活而不謀自力更生之道，是年靑人的一種恥辱，你為什麼不立刻設法去謀自立，而留戀於一點點的家產？</p>

<p>Manila, December 28th, Havas: Official sources have announced that American forces are continuing to fight bravely in northern Luzon, but the number of Japanese troops far exceeds that of the Americans. American reinforcements are reportedly on their way.</p>
<p>London, December 17th, Havas: Reuters reports that after landing at ××××, Japanese troops are advancing on Manila in two directions. The first route is via ××, and the second is via the ××××××××××× mountain road.</p>
<p>Argentina's Capital, December 28th, Haitian Press: According to a US Army Department communiqué, Japanese troops continue to land to the north and southeast of Manila. Fierce battles are currently underway southeast of Manila.</p>
<p>Bangkok, December 18th, Haitian Press: Reports received here today indicate that the United States has dispatched reinforcements to both the northern and southern parts of the Philippines. Fierce battles are believed to be ongoing. The number of reinforcements is not yet known. American forces in the seven cities of the province of Tarlac have already withdrawn. According to a report from the governor of the province of Tayabas, the vanguard of the Japanese army has reached a certain location, and the military is using explosives to destroy bridges and roads to impede the Japanese advance. According to the Manila Tribune, the American oil tanker "Edward" was sunk, and three other ships were hit and caught fire.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 28th, Haitian Press: Authoritative sources here declared today that Japanese forces have seized absolute air supremacy in both the Philippines and Malaya. At the beginning of the Pacific War, it was estimated that there were about 320 aircraft in Malaya, but now only 90 remain, including 40 heavy aircraft. That is,</p>
<p>London, December 27th, Reuters: (Rebroadcasting from Chongqing) The Japanese army's pincer threat to Manila, the capital of the Philippines, is intensifying daily. Japanese troop transport fleets are continuously importing large numbers of troops to the northern and eastern coasts. The US Army Department announced that fierce battles have broken out in Lingayen Gulf, only 70 miles from Manila. This afternoon, Japanese aircraft in batches made low-altitude attacks on Manila for three hours. A large number of incendiary and explosive bombs fell on the harbor area and the city center, causing many casualties. Historically famous buildings have also been damaged, and some streets are on fire. Fire brigades are still fighting the fires at night.</p>
<p>Manila's Demilitarized Status; Japan Clarifies its Position</p>
<p>Manila, December 27th, Havas: Official sources have announced that starting today, no more trains will depart from Manila. The government authorities have taken this measure to avoid civilian casualties due to Japanese bombing of the railways.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 28th, Domei News Agency: A spokesman for the Army Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today that the Japanese forces on Luzon have rejected the declaration designating Manila as a demilitarized city. The spokesman said that the actions of the Japanese forces in the Philippines will not be restricted by such unilateral notifications and will proceed with the steps deemed necessary in the course of the war. The spokesman also pointed out that the vicinity of Manila contains important military and naval facilities, but the actions of the Japanese forces will be limited to attacking military targets. Filipinos, Americans, and non-combatants currently residing in Manila must evacuate to two locations near the city designated by the Japanese command: Antipolo and Montalban. These two towns are easily accessible from Manila, and civilians seeking refuge there will receive proper treatment upon the arrival of the Japanese forces. The spokesman further stated that the Japanese forces will cease attacks until the American forces formally surrender.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 28th, Haitian Press: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Army Department today commented that the American announcement of Manila as a demilitarized city was entirely a unilateral action by the United States because the Japanese government has not received formal notification. However, Japanese forces in the Philippines have taken various measures to spare Manila's citizens from the ravages of war. Japanese aircraft only bomb military targets and harbor facilities and drop leaflets ordering citizens to evacuate. The American claim that Japanese aircraft bombed schools, hospitals, and churches is false. This is an American attempt to induce American nations to declare war on Japan.</p>
<p>Bangkok, December 28th, Haitian Press: According to reports received here today, six hours after General MacArthur, commander of the US Far East forces, declared Manila a demilitarized city, Manila lost its aspect as a military center. All American and Filipino naval and ground forces, the government under President Quezon, and the offices of US High Commissioner Sayre have all relocated. Currently, battles on both the northern and southern fronts are fierce, especially in the province of Tayabas in the southeast. Fierce tank battles are occurring. The day Manila was declared a demilitarized city was the day the Japanese aircraft most fiercely bombed the city. The city was bombed all day long, especially the waterfront. The "Bicol" of the Madrigal Shipping Company slowly sank at the bombed pier, indicating it was scuttled. The police ordered all ships to move away yesterday morning, but because of the shallow tide, most were still docked at the pier. Ipoh evacuates women and children</p>

<p>Tokyo, December 28th, Haitian Press: The Japanese army in Malaya has reached the "Poh Fong Line," which British military experts had predicted could be held for three months. However, the Japanese army broke through the line in 24 hours, defeating 20,000 Indian troops. The Japanese army seized 40 armored vehicles, 60 artillery pieces, 20 automobiles, and a large number of war materials at the "Poh Fong Line."</p>
<p>London, December 27th, Reuters: (Rebroadcasting from Chongqing) Fierce battles are taking place in central Malaya, vying for the Malayan tin mining areas. British Imperial troops are fighting at a line 70 miles north of Ipoh.</p>
<p>Singapore, December 28th, Reuters: (Rebroadcasting from Chongqing) Fierce fighting is reported to have occurred 25 miles north of Ipoh. The Japanese are rushing fresh troops to reinforce the area. The war on the northwest line of Malaya has been relatively quiet in recent days, but it is expected that the war on that line will intensify again in a short period. The British army has also taken advantage of the quiet period to step up its deployments.</p>

<p>Sydney, December 27th, Havas: Former Australian Prime Minister Hughes recently stated that the change of commander-in-chief of the British Far East forces can be seen as "Britain's recognition of the incompetence and inadequacy of the military authorities there, but it is too late. In the two battles of Libya and Crete, we have already witnessed Britain recognizing the military authorities' inability to cope with the new terrible situation, but it is also too late."</p>

<h3 id="e10">Germany's Attention Focused on Turkey, Spain, and Portugal; Though Bā Běn Provides Assurances, Turkey's Vigilance Has Not Been Relaxed <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Bern, December 27th, Havas: Since German Führer Hitler recently took over as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and issued a statement to the soldiers, speculation has been rampant, and there have been many unfounded rumors. The Führer said that Germany would soon take decisive military action, and the Soviet war would become a war of position. People are paying particular attention to this statement. A Basel newspaper correspondent in Berlin recently wrote a lengthy dispatch discussing Germany's future military actions. The article extensively cites an article recently published in the country's "Labor Front Magazine" by Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy. According to the article, German workers have built vast defenses along the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean in the past year and a half, so the coastal defenses are now as solid as a rock. Several coastal ports have steel and concrete submarine bases to protect submarines from air raids. Therefore, the correspondent believes that Berlin's attention is now focused on the Mediterranean, especially Portugal, Spain, and Turkey. As far as Portugal is concerned, since Britain and the Netherlands jointly occupied Portuguese Timor, Prime Minister Salazar issued a statement condemning it. Although the German Foreign Ministry stated at the time that the Portuguese issue had been relegated to a secondary position, it did not consider Prime Minister Salazar's statement to be a decision on the country's relations with Britain. This is one point. As for Spain, the German Foreign Ministry has repeatedly denied various rumors and called them malicious, but recently British aircraft bombed German ships docked in a Spanish port. Spanish Foreign Minister Suña is currently hunting in a certain location, so it is still unclear what position the Spanish government will take on this incident. However, it can be asserted that the German government is paying close attention to this incident. This is the second point. As for Turkey, according to a report from the National Daily correspondent in Turkey's capital, Führer Hitler's takeover as Commander-in-Chief of the Army has deeply impressed Turkish political figures. Turkish public opinion generally believes that major changes will occur soon. Although German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen recently gave assurances to Turkish President İnönü, their nature is not sufficient to relax Turkey's vigilance regarding the future of the war. Therefore, although the Soviet front is currently experiencing heavy snow and extreme cold, people in Turkey's capital are paying more and more attention to the war there. This is the third point.</p>

Clearing operations are currently underway in both areas, but because the area is too large, it will take some time.</p>

<h3 id="e25">British House of Commons to Discuss South Pacific Issue, Importance of Pacific Cannot Be Underestimated, Military and Diplomatic Considerations Must Be Re-examined <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Reuters) - According to well-informed sources in Britain, members of the House of Commons will raise several questions regarding the Pacific after the Christmas break. London believes that events in Europe are more important than the Pacific, but it cannot ignore the possibility that the United States may halt supplies to Europe due to the Pacific situation. Therefore, Britain cannot underestimate the importance of the Pacific, especially the strength of Japan. Some members of parliament do not want to condemn the government for failing to make adequate preparations in the Far East. The United States also believes that Britain has made preparations in the Far East, as evidenced by the dispatch of two large battleships to Singapore. Other members blame the government's incompetence and unintentional blunders, with inappropriate measures taken in both military and diplomatic fields. Officials in Singapore believed early on that Thailand could not defend itself. Regarding the criticism of the fall of Hong Kong, it is said that if Kowloon had not been abandoned first, Hong Kong could have been defended. However, defending Kowloon required assistance from China. Britain had no solid defense for Kowloon, and its disputes with Chongqing only ended after withdrawing from Kowloon. All of these factors suggest that the island's loss was inevitable. As for the defense of Singapore, it relied solely on the navy and so-called impregnable forts, but paid no attention to attacks from land and air. Therefore, the airfield there had no defensive equipment, and the railway linking Thailand was not destroyed. The above is the reason for the loss of two large battleships and Penang. The Japanese army now has control of the Molucca Strait, and Rangoon and the Burma Road are threatened.</p>
<p>The Times Comments on the War Situation</p>
<p>London, 28th (Havas) - The Times commented on the Pacific war situation today, stating that the loss of many airfields in Malaya and the sinking of two battleships should be attributed to the inadequacy of our air force strength. The fact that more than a hundred Japanese transport ships were able to land fully loaded with soldiers indicates this as well. The free movement of these transport ships is truly alarming. If we had reconnaissance aircraft, we should have detected their movements before they set out. Once they had set out, squadrons of torpedo bombers, protected by fighter planes, would have been enough to inflict heavy damage on them. However, the actions of these troop transports were as if they were entering an unguarded territory, indicating that both Britain and the United States were completely unprepared. There are too few planes to cover our land and naval operations, which is particularly noteworthy. The reason for this is likely that the importance of the war in other theaters has exhausted our strength. In this new theater of war, the air force of the Dutch East Indies is well-equipped and highly skilled. Although it is not as numerous as our air force in other theaters, it plays an important role in the Pacific. Therefore, the serious threat to the Philippines is particularly unfavorable. Especially after the fall of [missing text], the Japanese can directly bomb the Dutch air force bases in Borneo and Java from the airfield there. However, we must admit that the United States is potentially the strongest country in the world, and its current situation is exactly the same as our situation in 1939. It takes time to put air force units into a state of war. In view of the development of the war situation, we have increasingly focused on protecting airfields. We must quickly replenish all air force bases in Australia, the Dutch East Indies, India, the Near East, and the British mainland, based on the lessons learned in Malaya and the Philippines.</p>

<h3 id="e30">All Eight Major Rice Warehouses Have Been Opened, More Low-Priced Rice Shops Should Be Added, Only One-Tenth of the Over 800 Rice Shops in the Two Settlements Have Received Imported Rice <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office has designated rice shops to pick up imported rice from the Longmao Warehouse on Chengdu Road. Although yesterday was Sunday, the warehouses opened as usual to distribute rice to retailers. However, the Bank of China's warehouse will open today to distribute rice. In addition, the Taikoo Warehouse will also open today, as some rice shops have applied to move rice that is still designated to be picked up from the Taikoo Warehouse. As for the rice remaining in the Xinyuan and Maotai warehouses, it will be temporarily</p>
<p>Not Implemented for Low-Priced Sale When Wet</p>
<p>Also, a reporter from the Da Dao News Agency obtained an unofficial message that the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee, in order to prevent retailers from reselling for profit, should wet the rice before granting it to the public at retail. However, some parties have expressed disagreement, believing that as the retail quantity cannot be increased, this measure would only increase the difficulties of the retail civilians. Therefore, this matter is unlikely to be implemented. As for the method of scientifically stamping each retail crowd, it is also considered by the rice shops to be unreliable and is currently shelved.</p>
<p>Too Few Low-Priced Rice Shops</p>
<p>When selling at retail, the rice shops still use white powder to write numbers on the arms of each retailer. The queue is monitored by constables to prevent crowding. The underage and elderly are often assisted by constables or helped with purchases, so the order is slightly better. It has been found that there are 500 rice shops in the International Settlement and 320 in the French Concession. Only one-tenth of them have applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council to receive imported rice for sale. It is no wonder that the retail crowds are so crowded. Therefore, unless it is possible to have rice shops sell universally, it is difficult to expect the current crowding phenomenon to disappear.</p>
<p>Increasing Supply of National and Imported Rice</p>
<p>It is now understood that the authorities have instructed their subordinates to handle the procedures for registering, paying for, and delivering imported rice fairly, and to provide convenience to legitimate rice merchants. As for the rice warehouses that have been approved by the Japanese side to open for delivery, there are already eight major Chinese and foreign rice warehouses, including Taikoo, Roosevelt, Xinyuan Maotai China, and Longmao. It is said that the above eight warehouses store the most food, with the amount of imported rice reaching more than 30 million bags. According to the current rice distribution channels, it can supply two months of needs. The Japanese side has also continued to open the remaining food warehouses, so there is no fear of interruption in the distribution of imported rice by rice shops in the future. According to rice merchants, national rice has been continuously transported to Shanghai in the past week, and small retailers in the urban area have formed groups, totaling no less than 100,000 stones.</p>
<p>Still Extremely Difficult to Obtain Flour for Cakes and Steamed Buns</p>
<p>The Cake and Steamed Bun Industry Association has recently seen an increasing number of businesses closing down due to the difficulty of purchasing flour in the market. Members of the association have repeatedly requested the association to continue to supply low-priced flour to the settlement authorities to alleviate business difficulties and the people's suffering. The association has now sent letters to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, requesting that they issue low-priced flour as much as possible. It also appealed to all sectors, stating that the products of our cake and steamed bun industry are essential daily food for the city's civilians. In mid-October, when the price of flour exceeded 37 yuan, we dared to first request the Shanghai Municipal Council to continue to regulate the people's food supply and maintain low prices, and issued two notices to maintain the original price to reduce the burden on customers. On the 5th of this month, thanks to the Shanghai Municipal Council's consideration of business difficulties, 1,500 bags of low-priced flour were approved and distributed to members for use at the prescribed price. At that time, the industry was able to barely survive and maintain business for three to four days. But three weeks have passed since then, and members' desire for flour is like a precious treasure. The association's efforts to request assistance have encountered difficulties, so that the lives of more than 300 cake and steamed bun shops in the city are on the verge of extinction, and the daily food supply of civilians is in imminent danger. If this continues to spread, it will have a profound impact on society. We hope that flour warehouses at sea and the settlement authorities will continue to provide supplies. We are very grateful."</p>

<p>Regarding the relocation of citizens, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued an emergency notice today (29th), stating: 1. Anyone who wishes to move from outside the Japanese military cordon line around Shanghai into the cordon line must obtain permission from the local Japanese military police. 2. Regarding the relocation of residents within the Japanese military cordon line area, if anyone wishes to move from areas outside the French Concession and the Public Settlement (but including the Public Settlement area east of North Henan Road and north of Suzhou Creek) into the French Concession and the Public Settlement area (but not including the Public Settlement area east of North Henan Road and north of Suzhou Creek), or from the French Concession and the Public Settlement area (but not including the Public Settlement area east of North Henan Road and north of Suzhou Creek) to outside the French Concession and the Public Settlement area (but including the Public Settlement area east of North Henan Road and north of Suzhou Creek), they must also obtain permission from the local Japanese military police. 3. Anyone who violates the above two items will be severely punished by military law. In addition, anyone who informs the Japanese army of violations of the preceding two provisions will be given an appropriate reward. 4. Anyone who wishes to move out of the Japanese military cordon line to a place outside the cordon line, the Japanese army should allow them freedom.</p>

<p>The Shenzhen Fa Pawnshop at No. 123 Ba Li Qiao Street in the French Concession, which is operated by Zheng Guangren from Chaozhou, Guangdong, was suddenly entered by six bandits at around 3:00 PM yesterday. The bandits pulled out items and took advantage of the opportunity to break into the shop hall. Two bandits drew handguns to prevent any noise, driving all the staff into a room, where one bandit guarded them with a gun. Three bandits searched everywhere, resulting in the robbery of a large amount of</p>
<p>Cash and Clothing</p>
<p>Worth about more than 60,000 yuan. The bandits wrapped all the stolen goods in cloth, carried them away, and fled. The proprietor immediately reported the incident. The police sent detectives to investigate and cut off traffic along Avenue Edward VII from Rue Montigny to San Mao Ge Bridge with wire mesh, searching passing pedestrians. The situation was quite tense for a while. Nearby shops, unaware of what was happening,</p>
<p>Closed Down One After Another</p>
<p>After learning about the robbery, they immediately opened their doors and resumed business as usual, but were already badly frightened. A staff member of the pawnshop, Tang Binglong, 22 years old, from Guangdong, offered slight resistance and was stabbed in the left thigh with a sharp knife by the bandits. The wound was very deep, and blood flowed profusely. He was sent to Kwong Chiu Hospital for treatment by the police. Four customers were also tied up with ropes by the bandits and dragged into the room.</p>
<p>Statement by the Chief of the Reporting Department</p>
<p>Regarding the relocation of citizens and their return to their hometowns in the above-mentioned area, the Chief of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued the following statement: Regarding the relocation of citizens and their return to their hometowns in the Shanghai area, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai has already issued a notice today. Although certain restrictions have been imposed on those who move from areas outside the Japanese military cordon line around Shanghai into the cordon line, and when residents within the cordon line move their residences, the main purpose is none other than to ensure peace and order within the Shanghai area. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities have no intention of restricting those who wish to leave the two settlements and other places within the Japanese military cordon line for the purpose of returning to their hometowns. That is, even if those returning to their hometowns do not have a certificate of proof, the Japanese military authorities will, of course, not restrict or prohibit the household property they move out, as long as it is within a reasonable scope. If anyone wants to apply for a permit to return to their hometowns to avoid misunderstandings, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, or the Japanese Consulate General can issue it at any time. It should also be noted that the provisions of item 4 of the notice only apply to Chinese people and do not apply to foreigners. Furthermore, the Japanese military cordon line has two types: an outer perimeter cordon line and an inner perimeter cordon line. The cordon line referred to in this notice is the outer perimeter cordon line around Shanghai, that is, the ring from Xiangyin Road, Shuidian Road, Zhongshan Road, Zongjiazhai to Longhua Ferry, Huangpu River along Pudong Road to Nantaojia Ran, crossing the river to Xiangyin Road.</p>

<p>Since the drastic changes in the international situation, charitable organizations have continued to work hard on relief work, but due to the difficulty of obtaining supplies, they feel that their efforts are not enough. The Shanghai Three Teachings Morality Charity Association continues to supply porridge and rice tickets for donations from all sectors, and also requests rice in accordance with the law, so that the association's 20 food distribution centers can continue to distribute food. All clothing tickets are also sold at a reduced price of 13 yuan in national currency per set. However, the 200 registered hidden poor households and 60 widowed and orphaned households have experienced extreme difficulties in obtaining supplies since the interruption of rice and wheat from the American Red Cross, and the suffering of the hidden poor is even greater than before. Therefore, it is hoped that benevolent people from all walks of life will generously adopt them. When adopting, you can inspect the registration book at the association's office and choose in person. The association's office is located at No. 10, Hongyun Villa, Lane 71, Jing'an Temple Road, telephone 91067.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Purchasing Low-Priced Rice and Reselling for Profit <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the lack of imported rice, the amount of imported rice obtained by various rice shops from the Shanghai Municipal Council's warehouse is not much. It is sold at low prices to the market to help the poor. Those who go to buy it are extremely crowded, with each person queuing for several hours before being able to buy three liters of low-priced rice. The elderly, infirm, and young children are unable to buy this low-priced rice. Currently, there are strong young idlers who take advantage of the opportunity to go to various rice shops to buy rice first and then sell it to others for profit. Each time they can get at least four or five yuan for a peck of low-priced rice. At around 7:00 AM the other day, Wu Atai, a Shaoxing native of this kind, bought six liters of low-priced rice at a rice shop near Gordon Road and Changping Road, totaling 8 yuan and 10 cents. After a while, while selling it to an old woman for 10 yuan, he was spotted by patrolman No. 633 of the Third District Police. He was arrested and taken to the police station along with a bag of low-priced rice. The police sent him to the Special Court No. 1 the day before. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the process, stating that the defendant took the opportunity to profit from this, and requested an investigation. After questioning by Judge Zhan, he was ordered to be detained and await sentencing.</p>

<p>The suspension of overseas transportation has had the greatest impact on the import and export industry. The business of various import and export foreign firms has almost completely stopped. Looking ahead, it is difficult to recover in the short term. Some foreign firms will implement layoffs or prepare to close down at the end of this month. In addition, various industries that rely solely on exports, such as peppermint manufacturing, bakelite manufacturing, egg industry, tea industry, lace industry, thermos bottle industry, glass industry, toy industry, antique industry, knitting industry, and towel industry, have all been severely hit. Sales have been cut off, and they have reduced work to weather the crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Shanghai's Commerce Must Still Be Maintained, and Will Be Resupplied from the Mainland <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury published a prediction by the famous economist Annahneng on the future of commerce in the city. The general idea is that Shanghai will welcome the New Year this week with an unprecedented situation. In the more than 100-year history of Shanghai as an international business center, it has never been as isolated as it is today. Business in the city has never been as controlled as it is now, and merchants in the city have never encountered such difficulties, needing to work hard to adapt to the ever-changing environment in order to maintain their business.</p>
<p>Business Must Still Be Conducted</p>
<p>It is difficult for us to say whether the coming year will bring us peace or whether the world will still be at war in the next twelve months. If the war does not end, the future situation will remain turbulent and uncertain. However, business in the city can hardly sit and wait for the situation to clear up. We must continue to maintain it, because the business of the city is not only to supply the food, clothing, and housing of 4 million residents, but also to manage industries worth billions of dollars in investment, and the culmination of more than 100 years of economic innovation and improvement in the Far East. Shanghai has large-scale industrial facilities, easy transportation, and financial facilities, so no matter how the situation changes, Shanghai will still be the key to business in the Far East.</p>
<p>No Need to Overly Worry about Controls</p>
<p>There are still many difficult problems to be solved, but it is hoped that they can be solved one by one. The authorities' control of rice, flour, soybean oil, fat, and coal is all aimed at using these items economically and distributing them fairly. The authorities' management of hundreds of items has limited most major daily necessities to reasonable prices. The implementation of this control and management is the first time in Shanghai. Merchants in the city have tried their best to oppose this kind of measure in the past. Even today, there are still those who are dissatisfied with this kind of measure. However, this attitude is not necessary. Private business should be based on public interest. In the future, there will be more and more control measures. In fact, this kind of measure has been implemented in other parts of the world for a long time, and we don't need to make a fuss about it.</p>
<p>The Mainland Can Provide Resupply</p>
<p>Relying only on Shanghai's current inventory is not enough to stabilize business in the city for a long time. Except for mineral oil, Shanghai's inventory of major items is quite abundant. However, if there is no continuous resupply, then the various commodities will eventually run out. Considering the current Pacific war situation and the difficulty of shipping, Shanghai's imported goods will all be taken from the Chinese mainland. The Japanese side is quite willing to allow Shanghai to obtain necessary goods from the mainland. Soon, Shanghai will be able to obtain this resupply from the mainland, especially coal. Shanghai will restore the trade situation before the Sino-Japanese War. Shanghai's position has not reached the point of seeking help everywhere. If food, fuel, and raw materials can be continuously supplied, then Shanghai's manufacturing industry can still produce a large number of industrial products to meet the urgent needs of the mainland."

<p>Mrs. Chen Deng, an elderly woman from Tongzhou residing in the attic at No. 4, Lane 98, Haizhou Road, allegedly lured Zhang Quan-sheng's fourteen-year-old daughter, Bao-di, a local resident and her landlord's daughter, on the street at around 3:00 PM on the thirteenth of this month to her relative's bungalow on Hejian Road. There, she falsely claimed that the girl's mother was having an affair and had been beaten bloody and driven out by her father, and was now staying somewhere in Badaitou. She instructed the girl to take her mother's clothes, some rice, and a loan of fifteen yuan to her. The young and naive girl believed her and did as she was told. The girl, a worker at the Honeycomb Woolen Yarn Factory on Guiyang Road, borrowed wages from the factory and went to her father Zhang Quan-sheng at the Shanghai Cotton Mill, but did not find him. Later, in the bungalow on Hejian Road, Chen Deng kept her under guard, forbidding her from leaving. Meanwhile, her husband, Chen Xiao-jin, tried to sell Zhang's daughter to others, but no employer was found. Zhang Quan-sheng, the girl's father, searched everywhere after his daughter went missing, finding no clues. Finally, the day before yesterday, he learned that his tenant, Chen Deng, was responsible. He reported the situation to the Yangshupu police station, who sent detectives to the address and arrested Mrs. Chen Deng, recovering Zhang's daughter from the bungalow on Hejian Road. They were both taken to the police station, and the day before yesterday, they were sent to the Special Court No. 1. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted her for abduction and disrupting the family, requesting investigation. Zhang's daughter then recounted the incident. When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive, claiming that her husband, who was at large, was responsible. Judge Zhan ordered her to be remanded in custody to await a suitable judgment.</p>

<p>The surge in commodity prices has been contained, and the cost of living index has declined. Yesterday, it was learned that the authorities of the two concessions, recognizing the urgent need to rectify transactions in various industries in the city, otherwise speculative merchants will continue to be active, affecting price control efforts. They are now planning a centralized trading method, where merchants must conduct transactions in a central location. This would facilitate management and unify prices. If this plan can become a reality and be quickly implemented, speculation will disappear.</p>

<p>The cost of living index for workers in the city, previously compiled and published regularly by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to facilitate employers in adjusting labor wages, has been increasing monthly this year, indicating that the surge in commodity prices, influenced by speculation, has not been contained. Yesterday, according to a source at the Industrial and Social Affairs Department, the department has completed compiling the cost of living index for Chinese workers and Western expatriates for this month, which will be published soon. According to the survey results, it has slightly decreased compared to last month.</p>

<p>The Aurora University and Middle School Football League was held yesterday afternoon at the Aurora Stadium on Luban Road, including two groups of middle schools and four groups of universities. Xuhui defeated the Baptist League with a brand-new style, with a score of 1-0. In addition, Guangxia has had a remarkable record in the league, always maintaining an undefeated honor.

<p>The Little Football Match, initiated by Wang Ruilong, was held yesterday at the Guangxia Stadium as a maiden trial. Yiguang beat Hongxing 2-1, Ruilong beat Lions' Voice Group B 2-1. Yesterday, thousands of spectators watched. At the beginning of the game, both sides felt inconvenient because it was the first trial kick, and the kicks were incompatible. Later, Wang Ruilong explained on the spot, and people started to get on track, using a smaller ball was simpler. Ruilong's Zhang Caide took the lead and scored a goal, and the first half ended. Lion's Voice's Ye Yi dragged his knife and split three circles, sweeping a goal into the ten-yard area. Before long, Ruilong's war flames rose again, and Xu Xisheng went deep alone, shooting fiercely from the right corner, starting, hitting the target. As a result, Ruilong beat Lions' Voice B 2-1. Yiguang and Hongxing took the stage. Hongxing's main general, He Jiatong, was absent from the battle, and the internal defense was lacking. Yiguang first broke through a city with Zhao Yongfang. Xiao Ziwen shot from the fifteen-yard line and pulled back a city. Each scored one goal in the first half, tying. In the sound of the rematch, Yiguang's Shen Jinda wore a hundred steps, cleverly hitting the bullseye. As a result, Yiguang overcame Hong Dian 2-1. A wonderful trial match ended.</p>

<p>— Tutu</p>
<p>Shanghai only recognizes clothes, not people. When winter clothes are missing, you can't help but think of a solution. Wearing only a top without a winter coat is not presentable. People may not ridicule you to your face, but behind your back, they will inevitably mock you. The nickname "tin can" cannot be avoided. Looking at the pedestrians on the street, all with coats on their backs, I feel terrible inside. The movie screen advertisements repeatedly tell people, "Time To Think About Overcoat." Indeed, without straining my eyes, I already feel that it's time to add a coat.</p>
<p>Thanks to the experience of wandering on the streets, I have a firm memory of which store has which kind of thing that I like, so that once I have money in hand, I can get it with one search. So, in a desperate situation, I managed to get a sum of money and ran to the store that I had already secretly agreed on in my heart.</p>
<p>The second-hand stores on Xiafei Road, lined up like fish scales, have already been visited by me countless times. Lingering in the windows and memorizing the prices are all repeated again and again. This time, returning to the old place, with a hundred and several tens of yuan in my pocket, my courage suddenly grew. When the clerk came up to greet me, I felt that I was indeed a big buyer. Running into the store, the clerk was turning over cabinets and windows, selecting items. Taking advantage of this free time, I looked at other customers and clerks. I saw a young man with a Philippine-style banana head paying a deposit, totaling 300 yuan. I secretly peeked at the order, which included a coat, a raincoat, and a used suit, totaling 1,100 yuan. The number was intimidating, and my body immediately shrank by half. My tongue involuntarily stuck out twice, and my heart softened immediately. I decided that I wouldn't buy anything if it wasn't a bargain.</p>
<p>The clerk had already placed various coats on the glass counter, a total of three: a dark blue thick woolen coat, priced at 280 yuan; a gray hair woolen coat, priced at 560 yuan; and a Holmes Bon autumn-winter dual-purpose coat, priced at 380 yuan. At that time, I didn't commit, but just studied the texture. As a result, the brand-new one was the cheapest, and the oldest one was the most expensive. The so-called woolen coat felt like cotton fabric to the touch. Even if you haggled, if you got your wish and calculated it at half price, it would still cost 140 yuan. Sweeping all the money in my pocket was still not enough. I didn't like the goods, and I didn't have enough capital, so I had to say sorry and leave. Because I didn't look back, I didn't know what the clerk's expression was like.</p>
<p>I ran to several stores in a row, just listening to others haggle. After calmly observing, I could only afford a coachman's checkered used coat. So, I got angry and simply stopped lingering and jumped on a third-class tram back to my old home. My wife's illness was getting worse, so this money was righteously used for her medical expenses. I sat blankly with the patient for a while, put on my old camel-hair robe, and continued my scissors and paste life.</p>
<p>New clothes have no fate with me, and used clothes are so unaffordable. Let civility be swept to the ground for the time being! This is a record. New dream.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Day of Layoff <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Xinmai</p>
<p>I have a friend who teaches at ×× Middle School. Because the school is not preparing to continue operating next semester, the principal summoned and held a meeting of faculty and staff on a certain morning in mid-December. News had already spread in advance, and the faces of most faculty and staff showed displeasure because whether they could get their monthly salary was a question, and unemployment next semester had become a problem.</p>
<p>In addition to the meeting that day, the principal also prepared four tables of wine and food, and the dishes were quite rich. It is said that the price of each table was 200 yuan. However, when everyone arrived and the principal stood up to report, what made all the faculty and staff gasp was that the principal began by saying that because the tuition fees collected by the school had been completely used to repay debts, the salaries could not be paid in full. Only half a month's salary would be paid for December, and there was no way for January. This meant that each teacher received one and a half months less salary, which really made all the staff look at each other in dismay, not knowing whether to laugh or cry!</p>
<p>The principal continued, saying that otherwise, if we continued to operate next semester, there would certainly be ways to think about the economic aspects. Now that we are not preparing to continue, we can no longer borrow money from others. When the semester ends, there will be no remaining funds, and for expenses, we will have to borrow money temporarily from others. Everything else can be figured out, but there is no way to figure out money.</p>
<p>All the faculty and staff were silent. Although the dishes that day were good, they seemed to have no taste when eaten. My friend finally stood up and spoke: "We have nothing else to say, except that we feel that the 200 yuan per table feast today is unnecessary. It would be more practical to divide this 800 yuan feast fee among us. Whether it's 5 yuan or 10 yuan per person, it would certainly be good to get even a penny more for poor teachers on this day. I wonder what the principal thinks?" This question was indeed somewhat miserable, and the principal naturally could not find appropriate words to answer...</p>
<p>Since there was no way to get money, there was naturally nothing to say. After eating the food, all the teachers and staff took half a month's salary from the principal helplessly. Everyone dispersed, and deeply felt that this day of layoff was too miserable. Other people can get severance pay, but poor teachers even received one and a half months less salary than they should have!</p>
<h3 id="e47">Talking About the "Change" Problem <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>I have heard many people talk about the "change" on the trams, which has now disappeared invisibly. The people who talk about it don't necessarily mind losing a few cents, but they feel regretful afterward. In fact, this is a social problem that is commonly seen and should be reformed. I have repeatedly taken the eastbound tram from New World to Bowling Alley, the fare is 12 cents. In the past, I would give the ticket seller 15 cents, partly because it was crowded and partly because I was in a hurry to get off the bus. He didn't give me change, and I didn't have time to argue with him. Today, when I took the bus, I gave him 20 cents. In theory, 7 cents should not be returned, but 5 cents should at least be returned. Before getting off the bus, I gave him a look, and he actually said, "Sorry, no small change," and that was it. This made me feel that this bad habit is becoming more and more serious.</p>
<p>After the ticket sellers had the case of taking advantage of people's lives, this trend has not completely stopped, but it has been slightly clarified. Now, this disguised form of taking advantage of people, using the excuse of not having small change and not giving change, is in full swing. Although this bad habit is not shared by all ticket sellers, the fact is very obvious and common. Most of the passengers are unwilling to argue with the ticket seller for a few cents. Even if they do argue, the other party is actually eloquent, completely different from the style of taking advantage of people, which skillfully causes conflict and delays the trip, thus creating a situation of "invisibly canceling change." Even the ticket inspectors ignore people's questions, indicating that they are also powerless, so the passengers should suffer a little loss!</p>
<p>Taking advantage of people is an immoral behavior, and not giving change is also an immoral behavior. It is never possible to use the lack of small change as a reason to ask for sympathy. Tacitly allowing ticket sellers to take advantage of people is equivalent to helping ticket sellers grow into immoral behavior; tacitly allowing ticket sellers to waive the return of change is not a mutated helper. Passengers should prepare small change in advance as much as possible and buy tickets at the price. Otherwise, when they encounter not giving change, they should also ask for it. They should not leave until they really have no change. They cannot tacitly allow ticket sellers to waive the return. The tram company authorities should investigate and reform this kind of fact in the shortest possible time. It may not be a remedy to reissue vouchers at a price. I think this suggestion will definitely win the sympathy of passengers, and I hope it can be implemented quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Rent Disputes <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Youzhui</p>
<p>Rent disputes in Shanghai are inherently one of the major practical social problems. Many large landlords take whatever they want, and second landlords act as accomplices, and the common people, who are third tenants, have the pain of not having a place to stand. But what about now? There are people who are laying off population, and there are people who cannot pay such a large rent. What should we do? With a thunderclap, the Municipal Council issued a brilliant announcement: "...At this difficult time, landlords...must be as reasonable as possible when demanding rent that is due. If possible, landlords should allow tenants to extend the payment period or temporarily reduce the rent..." At the same time, the French Concession Consul General also had the same announcement. This is really well handled, which alleviates a lot of the burden on the people. To be honest, if the rent can be paid, and there is no conflict with the landlord or even the second landlord, there will be less trouble; however, what is a pity is that some landlords are now seeing red in the eyes, and are negotiating to get "tips" from old tenants, which are two or three times higher than the rent. Now, they might as well take a break.</p>

<p>Things were about to get out of hand.</p>
<p>Meibao couldn't bear to blame her father again, so she had to bite the bullet and argue with them.</p>
<p>"Since you are superiors, you shouldn't have talked nonsense like that in the first place, and you were the first to hit someone!"</p>
<p>The waiters were at a loss as to how to persuade them.</p>
<p>At this moment, three more people walked in from outside the door; Little Li and the chubby boy didn't recognize them, but Meibao and the other four were familiar with them, and the main thing was that they were relieved, because these two were none other than the guests who had listened to them sing in No. 9 just now.</p>
<p>"Friends, please spare them! They are busking to make a living, which is quite pitiful," the oldest of the three said to Little Li and the chubby boy with a smile on his face.</p>
<p>At the same time, the student-like young man who had just paid ten yuan for listening to a play couldn't wait to urge Qiu Haitang and the other four to leave, saying repeatedly, "We'll take care of things here, you guys go back quickly!"</p>
<p>Meibao and the others also understood that he meant well, and hurriedly left the room according to him. (290)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Announcement of Essay Awards: Twelve Childhood Love <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Xinheng</p>
<p>Love is indeed not a children's game, which is further confirmed by my own unfortunate experience.</p>
<p>My family has prospered in recent years due to my father's willingness to take risks. The old man transformed from a pot-bellied clerk to a Western-style suit and leather shoes. I am his second daughter. My older sister was assigned by my father to a branch manager under him in her early years. A delicate younger sister at home is my aunt's (Southerners call my father's concubine "aunt"). My younger sister is trapped in the countryside with my mother, and my older brother has a pair of little girls who always clamor to go to school with my twin brother. My aunt "usually" doesn't love me, but fortunately, my birth coincided with the beginning of my father's fortune. My father is superstitious about this coincidence and calls me the pearl of the "lucky boy". In order to compete for favor, my aunt usually doesn't dare to discriminate too obviously.</p>
<p>We lived in peace for a few years, and I studied quietly. Until I was fifteen years old, I suddenly gradually felt a kind of thirst as if I needed something. In addition, I didn't get the love of my mother, so I couldn't help but be deeply flattered by the pursuit of a male classmate in school! I gradually fell into the sea of love from blushing. The school authorities, hindered by the fact that the Fairy family and my family were powerful school directors, did not interfere with us, and we played childish games without scruples, indulging ourselves uncontrollably. As a result, my father arranged our engagement.</p>
<p>I deeply recalled several times and asked myself if I really loved him at that time and fell in love with him? Tears soaked my handkerchief, and my nostrils twitched and turned red. I definitely admit that I did love him at that time, but I did only love a Western doll. No one will deny that although individuals have loved nipples in infancy and Western dolls in childhood, they can't love nipples and Western dolls when they grow up. The reason why I am indifferent to him now is really because of the evolution of the big performance, and certainly not because I have changed my mind.</p>
<p>It's not that I intend to mock him, nor is it that I deliberately devalue him as a Western doll. The reasons are:</p>
<p>(1) His family is very complicated. His father, who is also a nouveau riche, raised several mothers who do not live together single-handedly.</p>
<p>(2) Although he himself is loyal and honest, he is not studious, his thinking is immature, and he can only give me sweet love letters, but there is not a single encouraging word.</p>
<p>(3) At that time, the engagement was made because the parents of both sides were barely engaged because of the "established fact" that "they both liked each other." (It is said that when he asked his father to propose to my family, his father scolded him for being young and ignorant.)</p>
<p>(4) He is a adopted son of the moth called the stepmother, and he is very unpopular with his family. When he suffers losses, he often encourages me to use the negative method of "ending up without a result."</p>
<p>(5) Even if I really marry him, I think I will definitely not be used to it. The complicated family life is difficult for myself, not to mention that I may have to increase the friction between him and his family because of his love for me.</p>
<p>Next year, I plan to go to university. I don't want to disturb my brain preparing for lessons because of this unresolved case. I hope that the wise editor and experienced readers will give me a safe green light.</p>
<p>Editor's note: According to Miss Xinheng's description of the family, it is indeed not a source of happiness. However, the five problems she listed cannot be the reasons for dissolving the engagement, and they also show that she has not sown the seeds of good luck in her own marriage. First, she must recognize that what she is marrying is not his family but him. She should not be disappointed in him, but should instruct him and tell him how to improve himself if her intelligence is stronger than him. A girl once made small clothes for her Western doll and imagined making her Western doll satisfied. Why can't a grown woman enrich the mind of her Western doll and make him progress? Even if he has a white beard, she can love him as she protects a Western doll. Before you have exhausted your final efforts, never let the buds of hope be extinguished, and many successful people should record the reasons for their success in their wives' accounts. I hope Miss Xinheng will make extra efforts to cultivate a great man in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Do You Love Him? <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>If you are in love, or after you are married, you can ask the following questions to test whether you love him after all.</p>
<p>1. When you are together, do you feel the joy of being far away from each other?</p>
<p>2. Do you like to do the same work together? 3. Do you reconcile immediately after arguing with each other? Are these disputes unimportant?</p>
<p>3. Are you willing to make concessions to him? Can you forget or forgive his shortcomings?</p>
<p>4. Among the general men, is it possible for him to stand out from the crowd?</p>
<p>5. Do you get more excitement from him in terms of spirituality?</p>
<p>The answers to these questions can tell you whether you love him.</p>
<p>Family Mailbox</p>
<p>Miss Jinhua: Your letter has been forwarded to the scholarship section, please don't worry.</p>
<p>Mr. Delin: Pain like yours is very common. Many husbands feel that their wives are fond of vanity, spend money indiscriminately, and have no way to deal with it. Mr. Delin, you can explain your pain to your wife, but at the same time, you must strive for progress, because everyone lives on hope. If there is no hope for progress, you will lack the interest in life. A foundation in the first year of junior high school cannot be an obstacle to your progress. Many successful great men have never even been to school.</p>
<p>Mr. Yichengqiu: The stench and complexity of large families have been said too much to this day. Your father's thinking is the traditional thinking of the masters of general families, holding on to the family property and refusing to let go. However, you have not stated how old you are, what education you have received, and why you have no occupation. I think it is a shame for young people to rely on a little family property to maintain their lives without seeking self-reliance. Why don't you immediately find a way to seek self-reliance and linger on a little bit of family property?</p>
<h3 id="e52">Monday Home Cooking Menu <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Recently, in the small vegetable market, the price of fish is the cheapest for hairtail, and among the vegetables, celery is the cheapest. Celery is divided into two types: medicinal celery and water celery. Each bunch is priced at around one and a half to two corners. Medicinal celery has a medicinal smell, and some people don't like to eat it, but its taste is actually very clear and elegant. Water celery is also the same; stir-frying them with shredded pork or shredded beef is great with rice. If you want to make a vegetarian dish, you can stir-fry it with dried tofu shreds. For something simpler, you can mix it for eating. Just scald it in hot water first, then mix it with soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame paste, etc. After eating greasy food, a plate of mixed celery to go with porridge is definitely very appetizing.</p>
<p>Monday: Stir-fried Pork with Celery, Sweet and Sour Fried Hairtail, Spinach and Tofu Soup, Fried Dough Sticks, Yellow Soybeans, Mao</p>
<p>Tuesday: Vermicelli with Shredded Beef, Scrambled Duck Eggs, Braised Rolls, Vegetable Snow Cabbage and Broad Beans</p>
<p>Wednesday: Shepherd's Purse and Shredded Pork Soup, Steamed Hairtail with Lard, Stir-fried Vermicelli with Green Vegetables, Beijing Winter Vegetables and Bean Sheets</p>
<p>Thursday: Stir-fried Beef with Celery and Bean Sheets, Bighead Carp Head, Stir-fried Spinach with Fried Dough Sticks, Vegetarian Bean Curd Soup</p>
<p>Friday: Stewed Pig's Trotters with Yellow Soybeans, Clear Stewed Crucian Carp Soup, Stir-fried Dried Tofu with Celery, Snow Cabbage and Green Soybeans</p>
<p>Saturday: Salted Meat and Tofu Soup, Stir-fried Crab Roe with Cabbage Heart, Braised Yangzhou Vegetables, Fresh Artemisia and Golden Flower Vegetables</p>
<p>Sunday: Stir-fried Diced Chicken, Fermented Green Fish, Vegetarian Ten Delights, Spicy Cabbage</p>

<h3 id="e53">(152) Fish Balls <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Draft by Yao Kechang</p>
<p>Ingredients: Grass carp, egg white, salt, cooking wine, MSG, chicken soup. Preparation: First, scrape off the scales of the grass carp, then remove the fish bones, wash it clean, and chop it into fish paste on a cutting board. Put it in a bowl, add an appropriate amount of water, egg white, MSG, cooking wine, salt, etc. Use dozens of chopsticks to vigorously stir it until it becomes mushy. Then you can make the balls. When making them, place a large bowl of warm water next to you (the temperature should not be too hot). Then, use your right hand to grab a handful of fish mixture from the bowl. Cooperate with your index finger and thumb to make a circle. Squeeze the fish mixture in your hand out from the circle to form a fish ball. Immediately put it into the warm water. Wait for it to float, then you can scoop it up. When eating, cook it with chicken soup or vermicelli, and the taste will be very good.</p>
<h3 id="e54">(153) Roast Beef <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Draft by Gao Peiqing</p>
<p>Ingredients: Beef or mutton, salt, dry flour. Preparation: First, rub salt around the entire piece of beef, marinate for one or two hours. Then, use a fork to hold the meat and hang it flat in front of the stove. When starting to roast, keep it a little further away from the fire, then move it closer to the fire. First roast the side with the bones. When it is half cooked, turn it over to roast. Repeat roasting for about half an hour until the meat is fully cooked. When roasting the meat, you must use another container to place under the meat to store the dripping juice, and frequently pour it on the meat. When roasting, you must also apply dry flour around the meat to prevent it from burning. Ladies and gentlemen: If you want to buy "MSG", "Heavenly Chef Soy Sauce Extract", and oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, please call "44594". A special messenger will deliver it immediately, with no delivery fee.</p>
