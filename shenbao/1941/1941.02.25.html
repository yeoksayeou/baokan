<p>西貢　日方昨稱、法屬越南陸軍當局已將官兵等之休假一律取消、並令彼等返隊候命、據稱、此種舉動、乃係陸軍高級當局上星期五開會之結果、彼等決定賡績戰爭、準備於今日飛返河內、據日人稱、德古少將希望將陸軍總司令部自河內移至西貢、同時並準備將越南南部陸軍司令自西貢移至束埔寨、俾組織新的自衛步驟、　時消息靈通之權威界稱、泰越在東京之談判、爭執點雖多、惟尙未破裂，軍政當局皆表示希望於明日停戰協定期滿之前、將爭執加以解決、惟彼等現時正密切注意一切、表示泰國如堅持要求、則彼等亦已準備出以武力行動、（廿四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>西貢　權威方面今日宣稱、明日即將期滿之泰越停戰時效、將伸延至三月七日、又據日人目睹、自星期六起、兵車不絕向泰邊境移動、法巡洋艦一艘、昨日駛離西貢、易二艘則於上星期六開駛、當係向暹選灣前駛者云、（廿四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　今晚情報局發表公報、宣布泰越休戰協定已再行展期十日、至三月七日爲止、據稱調停泰越邊境糾紛會議、二月七日在外相官邸舉行第三次非正式會議後、日本即與泰越雙方代表分別進行談判、鑒於兩國休戰限期轉瞬即屆、况有若干問題须續加商討、昨日日代表即以調停人資格向雙方代表請求將休戰期限延長十日、至三月七日中午爲止、此項要求、已經雙方接受、今日午後五時至六時一刻、三方代表又在外相官邸舉行第四次非正式會議、談話情形甚爲融洽、（廿四日路透社電）</p>
<p>盤谷　本日政府有權方商預言、與越南所訂之停戰協定、將延展期限、並謂相信必可獲得和平解決云、（西貢方面消息謂停戰已展期至三月七日）、但此間法國人士方面、則殊不樂觀、彼等預測法國將拒絕停戰協定再行展期、彼等並力言法國在放棄對越南之主權前、必將作殊死戰云、同時在遠東和戰朱決之緊張空氣中、美國駐泰公使格蘭今晨往訪泰代外交部長地力克、非官方面對於日艦在泰國海灣之活動及日軍在越南北部之行動極爲注意、彼等顯然相信日軍將越過泰國而進攻緬甸云、（二十四日合衆電）</p>

<h3>日與荷印貿易談判</h3>
<p>東京　據日方今日巴逹維亞之消息、最近遠東謠諑雖不絕如縷、惟日本與荷印間之貿易談判、已成立一種「互相諒解」、日方通訊社又稱荷、日代表成立諒解」之結果、談判前途當有樂觀之希望、（二十叫日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　日日新聞載厦門消息、荷輪在遠東方面之停止駛行者爲貨船、客輪則照常行駛上海、瓜哇間、但由新加坡至上海者　則不停厦鬥、（二十四日海通社電）</p>
<p>盤谷　泰國官方稱、無論由於外交步驟或邏軍進攻之結果、泰國國旗不久將飄揚於越南湄公河岸之薩凡納開維安梯安大開等埠上、泰國期望日木之</p>
<p>泰官方稱調解不成軍隊仍將進攻越南</p>
<p>調解將產生良好結果、吾則將繼續進攻、在此衝突之全期中、泰陸軍一向等候法軍之取攻勢、妥事準備防範、但終待至兩方各採取長期之「報復行動」後始攻入法境、在森林密茂之湄公河兩岸作軍事活動、極爲困難、在法境沿岸、一英里寬之湄公河、爲第一道難關、河外有一帶叢山爲第二道阻礙、均可使進攻者色沮、葛藤榮繞之森林中、僅有仄徑可通、非有大決心之軍隊、不易通過此種障礙、故泰國軍界、在此一區並不期望有積極戰爭、在湄公河兩岸、僅有少數地勢重要之小鎭設有防務、其餘各鎭、僅有警察數名看守、至溝通各鎭之路徑、原甚狹窄、現在從速加寬改造中、多數市鎭之居民均已奉令撤退、泰之番農鎭、係最先被法機所炸者、現已不准民居居住、較南之慕逹漢鎭、因被法軍巨砲屢轟、亦已撤空、較北之農凱鎭，聽令平民自定行止、距邊境三十英里之鳥勃爾會被法機轟炸數次、其行政長官曾下令所有之商人店員、應即速行回城復業、吾則取消其營業權、湄公河沿岸之泰國軍隊、食糧係取給於兩地、即北方之烏鐸恩及南方之烏勃爾、兩地均鐵路要點、法軍似亦承認該地點之重要、國曾將該地轟炸多次也、泰國東部並無硬面汽車路、外國軍隊之侵人泰境者、僅有兩條路徑可循、其中一條爲自派克西至烏勃爾之公路、至該處即有鐵路可達盤谷、另一條爲自農凱及番農至烏鐸恩、該處亦有鐵路、泰國軍界稱、阿蘭亞普賴台脫及脫拉脫附近、均有大槪泰國軍隊集中、堅信可以抵抗全部邊界之敵軍攻犯、必要時可於二十四小時內攻佔上述之泰國所需要之兩區云、（二十四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　天主敎日報益世報、今日對於法國之拒絕日本所提調停泰越爭端辦法、加以評論稱、「維希方面現已無曲媚日本之理、」該報力霄維希不必在太平洋地域向日本讓步、因英美在太平洋上之軍事佈置、實已完成矣、在過去某時期、日本曾夢想利用越南爲其之出發點、維希方面之抗議、使日本爲之驚異、日人之甜密的夢亦爲之驚破、貝當採取强烈手段、自然曾獲得某種有力之後盾、荷印對「東亞新秩序」提出抗議、而法國對日方所提之和議又加拒絕、使日本在南洋方面、處於進退兩難之境云、（二十四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>日外次在下院聲明嚴密注視英美行動</p>
<p>東京　日外次大橋忠一、今日在下院公債委員會於答覆訊問之際、對日本調解泰越料紛及日本與荷印之談判兩事發表意見謂、日本今於各方面均處於有利之地位且具有堅強之將陸軍、故日本此時頗能運用其外交政策、大橋又稱、英美反對日本調解泰越糾紛及日荷商務談判、殊屬毫無理由、日本因是將嚴密注視英美之行動、　今晨下院會議時、大橋並代表松岡發表陳述、謂調停戰事一節、還過係松岡致央外相艾登答覆中之枝節問題、（按英國消息、曾謂松岡致艾登之照會中、曾表示日本願調停世界任何處所之戰爭、）松岡照會之主要部分、乃係吾認日本有侵略南方之企圖、大橋又稱、英外相艾登、已向日駐英大使重光葵、對關於日本傳入英國之日本南進消息、提出意見、而日外相亦已將覆文令重光葵棘達、該覆文吾認日本對於南方抱有侵略態度、並謂三國同盟之目的、係防止戰爭之再形擴大、大橋總稱、日外相於該覆文中確曾吿艾登、日本於可能之下、願意從事終止全世界戰事之貢獻、並指陳日本之調解泰越糾紛即爲此意願之表示、然松岡之覆文中、並未提明日本欲調解歐戰、大橋最後謂日本將以堅强之努力、儘速結束中日戰事云、（廿四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>日報抨擊英美政策謂徒足激日本南進</p>
<p>東京　日日、聞一系之報紙皆載文抨擊英美鞏固太平洋之防務爲無端挑釁、並發警吿、謂日本如被迫起而應戰、則關島與新加坡均將一掃而盡、繼謂英國在日本之面前鞏固新加坡四周之防務、徒足激動日本之租平南進政策、而絕無他益、國且不斷，宣傳遠東大局惡化之讕言、更妄指外相松岡致艾登文爲日本願以調停歐戰自任、英國之出此、蓋欲離間日德義之邦交耳、日本人民監視英國之宣傳不得稍懈云、（二十四日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>從義相演詞說到未來攻勢</h3>
<p>黑衣宰相墨索里尼久已不發高論，想不到在義軍屢敗，盛傳里比亞駐軍準備全部撒至法屬都尼西亞的時候、却又怒吼。回憶他去年十一月十八日的演說，曾經岸然聲稱：「三月攻克希臘、，或一年攻克希臘，無關宏旨，法西斯的義大利決定拚命到底以湔雪此仇。」當時聞者對他置信的程度，當然遠不如彼的自信；而今次的演說、則已承認自泰蘭吐一役以來，義軍作戰不利，但仍表示對英作戰，「非戰至最後一滴血不止。」同時，他對德國所取態度，不像一個應與德國分庭抗禮的人；舉世聞其演辭者，殆必同聲慨歎於這一個曾經叱咤風雲，號稱老牌獨裁，而到了現在，不禁爲之有美人遲暮，日薄西山之感。其辭或亢或卑，察其主要作用，不外兩端：一、即拿來安慰對他尙未完全絕望的一部分人民與黨員，以冀繼續驅策法西斯專政下的羣衆，而設法消弭國內的騷動；一即用以告訴希特勒說，義大利今後尤願接受「領導」，繼續作戰，以冀維持他的盟主對他的信任，藉免盟主鑒於他的戰敗而橫生枝節。</p>
<p>義大利在軍事上的不濟，再無掩飾餘地；他和德國的關係，顯已自對等的同盟國地位，降爲仰賴德國，依恃德國。這在希特勒還想不出如何有效地打倒英國或想出而尙不敢造次的今日，英國却偏偏無情地對義發動多方面的攻勢，大有非把羅馬政府打得首先屈膝不肯罷休的氣槪；同時美國外交又復很巧妙地向着義國的弱點進攻。盛傳美國駐義大使費利潑前此返任的時候，曾以羅斯福總統的親筆函獻呈我大利國王，外間因有義國準備單獨媾和之說。在這種種情形之下，墨索里尼確有竭力向希特勒「表明心跡一的必要，所無法兩全者，在這種公開演說之中，不得不矮了半截，公開的承認戰敗。</p>
<p>希特勒在這時候，決不願以自此，惟我獨尊一自豪，相反的，必感到悲哀。他在表面上號稱擁有兩大盟友：但其中之一，「皮靴盟友」義大利，成爲百孔千瘡之局，一蹶不振，今後所需妥德國的扶持，遠較可能幫助德國者爲多。第二個「泥足盟友」日本，則因受中國作戰的牽掣，畏首畏尾，假痴假呆，始終不肯乾乾脆脆在南太牛洋替他放一把火。盟友若此，遂使耀武揚威的三角盟變成硬不起的一跛足軸心」回想自希特勒揚言發動春季攻勢以來，至少已歷三個月的時間，但始終未能見諸事實；這種時間上的蹉跎，在利於速戰速決的軸心，原是一種重大損失。推原其故，一方固因民治陣綫的日臻堅强，但另一方面却無疑地應該歸罪於義日兩國的外强中乾。不過，德義日三國之必須發動攻勢，以打破當前的僵局，並挽救日見消沉的頹勢，那是實逼處此，欲罷不能，雖屬毫無把握，仍然勢在必行。在這美國戰具租借法案行將成立，民治陣綫聯防運動節節推進之際，所予軸心國今後尙可拖延的時日，已屬「所剩無幾」。民治各國在這稍縱即逝的重要關關頭，吾人確認爲民治陣綫當前的課題，是在如何爭取主動，以制機先，昨論所謂「對於侵略者正在策動的攻勢，僅僅予以防範遏止是不夠的，必須根本解除根本肅淸一切危害的現狀與根源」，吾人願再三申言，以促民治各國的注意與致力。更默察德義日三國最近在外交上軍事上的種種動向：如希特勒在巴爾幹方面的積極佈置，對英發動大規模潛艇攻勢的準備，日本加緊壓迫越南以及日艦在暹羅灣巡弋的種種事實，試再印證墨索里尼一昨吾認單獨媾和與聲言作戰到底的演說，可見侵略陣綫雖類强弩之末，還是憧憬，於「聯合行動」的最後一擊；因此民治國當前的問題，祗有一個，就是決定等待侵略者選擇進攻的時機呢，還是先發制人？如果等待他們進攻，則旣無法預先確知侵略者究向何處首先下手，便不能不考慮到，假使軸心國果眞發動一個多方面的聯合攻勢，則民治陣綫是吾有多方面同時應戰的充分準備？萬一不然的話，則比較先發制人，亦即不等對方準備就緒，把侵略陣綫中比較脆弱份子，儘先打倒，至低限度也可以漸次削削弱對方攻勢的力量。具體點講，與其等日本南進，德義會攻希臘與德軍直撲英倫三島的時候，再來應戰，曷若以主動的姿態，覷定對方一二個弱點，先予痛加伐撻。事實上這種主動戰略，並不是十分艱難或十分危險的工作；就歐局言，祗須美國立即以大量飛機接濟英國，使英國能在地中海把握制空權，然後集中地中海兩岸的海陸空軍實力，向義大利本部猛擊，迫以屈膝。就遠東言，祗須美國一方速以大量戰具飛機，接濟中國，俾中國立即對日發動總反攻，一方再聯合英國荷印菲律濱以及不列顚帝國各屬地，加緊對日經濟封鎖；這樣，恐怕不待日本發動南進，西太平洋即可宣吿安定。我們雖不願很輕率的斷言於事屬輕而易舉，然敢言這是化了比較少的代價以爭取最大戰果的唯一方法。希望各關係國尤其是美國，勿再紆緩因循！</p>

<h3>堅守太平洋外壘中國必長期作戰（二）</h3>
<p>— 宋子文</p>
<p>我國最高統帥，最初即知機械化部隊之集中火力，在我國廣漠之土地上作戰，亦自有其困難。反之，日本如有短而良好之交通綫，以運輸其重砲坦克飛機，則可於任何戰　上擊破俺有輕武器且無空軍協助之中國軍隊。當華東戰事激烈時，我國上級軍官，莫不知我方陣綫或將被迫而彎曲，但決不能容其突破，目知敵人愈深入，則其攻勢愈衰，此項策略，我國參謀總長謂之「以空間換取時間」。</p>
<p>但中國如不能統一，則士兵之勇，亦無所用。我國富庶區域，雖相繼淪陷，沿海雖被封鎖，日機雖不斷轟炸，而我人民仍願繼續作戰，此實爲我國力量之永久基礎。當我主力軍向西退却，我方仍能採用一種非常的策略，以全軍或全師留在日人後方，就地給養，以威脅日軍之左右翼及後方。若舉美國地形爲譬喻，假如有敞軍於大西洋登陸，攻入潘雪文尼州而進擊俄亥俄州，但美國仍令大軍留於潘雪文尼州，聯合當地民衆，爲游盤隊活動之中心，又如敵軍竟達印第安那州，則美軍部隊，仍留於俄亥俄州及潘雪文尼兩州，以威脅制敵方守軍及不斷破壊其交通綫；故敵軍愈深入，則在危險區域之交通綫愈增長，其所需維持交通綫之兵隊，亦必愈衆，而其先頭部隊之力量，亦必愈西進而愈减弱。</p>
<p>今日試觀中國地圖，則有所謂淪陷區域，此等區域，紙表面上被佔領，實則僅佔有城市，而離城數里，仍屬中國政府權力範圍以內，照常征收賦稅，流通國幣，徘持治安，審理案件。日人或能佔　鐵道綫與重要之公路綫，但其座旁則爲中國正規軍或游擊隊所“守，時時炸斷橋樑，拆燬路軌，襲擊日人部隊，現在日軍最西達到宜昌，而上海，北平，南京左近數軍，則仍滿佈中國之正規軍隊。</p>
<p>日人現亦自知其佔　中國土地，實甚空泛而小穩定，亦自知其軍隊深陷困境，無法前進。四星期前，十二月二七日，芝加哥日報之斯梯勒君，自上海來電，謂日本陣軍新聞組長，亦直認中國之崩潰希望極微。該電內云：「日軍自認遭遇困難，此實爲可注意之新聞。馬淵上校留平年餘，近返東京。（未完）</p>

<p>名巴迦辛</p>
<p>在上海療養院職員宿舍充　閽有年、當屍體發現時、臉部覆有包頭巾，以掩可怖之傷口、屍穿綠色司閣服、經査視後、又見其胸部與兩臂均有遭斧砍傷口、兇手顯條持利斧、於巴迦辛踽踽而行、前往値班時、出其不意砍斃之、八時甫過、公共租界</p>
<p>警方得報</p>
<p>即派捕馳往該地、並召到「市警」得其許可、將屍首舁入公共租界、以巴迦辛乃英籍印人也、屍首舁人警務騐屍所、騐得巴迦辛斃命已數小時、諒係午夜赴療養院値班時被害、當時屍體僵臥路旁、其所穿灰綠色制服與地面顏色、幾難辨別、其大衣前鈕緊扣以掩身上傷口、惟</p>
<p>鮮血汩汩</p>
<p>流出、屍首週圍有如血泊、巴迦辛年的五十五歲、聞渠個人並無私仇、大約係兇手伺伏路旁候人時、適巴氏經過、偶遭毒手、警方已在塲攝影多幀、惟加偵査後、殊少結果、因兇手遺下之痕跡、已於當夜被雨水衝去也、按近年來西區已第三次發現遭砍斃之印人死屍、此前兩次均</p>
<p>發覺兇案</p>
<p>有政治性質、惟衆信今次巴迦辛被殺一案並無政治關係、又英文入美晚報云、英領署法庭騐屍官海恩斯今（二十叫日）晨在宏恩醫院檢騐巴迦辛屍體、並由上海療養院之台爾氏證明屍首爲司閣巴迦辛、丁仲英、常州孟河人、年五十四歲、寓公共租界靜安寺路一五三七弄金城別墅四號、診所即設樓下、並於福州路中和里七號設有分診所、每日午前十時至下午三時、在該分診所門診、昨日午前十時十分、丁循例由寓前往分診所、在寓前跨登自備之二一三六號皮而牌汽車後、即由車夫兪爾良（浦東人三十歲）駕駛、緩緩出弄、不料突有</p>
<p>豫伏路側</p>
<p>之靑布短衫褲之綁匪三名、各持手槍、踴上汽車、威脅俞開足速率、向西而馳、直至大西路法華附近、始將兪驅逐下車、當三匪在金城別墅口綁丁時、該里司閣捕河南人張東有（四十七歲）適在里口、曾被其中一匪以槍抵住其胸、恐嚇聲張、事後該匪亦</p>
<p>躍登汽車</p>
<p>而去、　張目覩各情、遂於事後告知丁家、一面據　報告捕房、又據悉丁生有五子、長子名濟華、現年三十四歲、在庽所診治、次子濟民、年三十一歲、在四馬路診所侍診、其餘濟南等三人、或赴內地求學、或負笈海外、當出事時、丁之一女傭正在曬台洗滌衣服之際、目擊共老主人</p>
<p>被匪架去、遂據情飛報其女主、亟用電話報吿靜安寺捕房、當飭派人批探捕驅車趕來、奈匪蹤已査、未幾司機及助手仲瑞生等回來、連同該弄司閣捕一併帶入捕房盤詰、至丁之汽車、直至薄暮六時許、尙未發現、現捕房正在嚴緝中、</p>

<h3>糧食南洋砲聲一日不響米商寗可一日不賣故昨日仍是把持不出之局面掮客不欲代人受過暫停上市</h3>
<p>洋米自爲大米商大四戶把持以來、成爲有行無市之局面、遂使米價暗漲、市面不安、蓋此輩仲長脖子、大有南洋砲聲一日不響、彼則寗可一日不售、無非欲希望市上所謠傳、一百數十元一市擔之洋米價、如今只售八十七八元、非有砲聲作援助、與其目標相差尙遠、故無論存棧一百數十萬、日到數萬包、毫不足以搖動其心志、然大衆方懸懸於米價之暴漲、購買之不易、有枵腹之憂、絕食之虞、焦急於求來之生活、天下事最不易得其平、以數百萬人生活之淵泉米糧、乃悉操之於少數富有資財大米商大囤戶之手、寗不可痛、本市掮客聯誼社鑒於去年代人受過、備蒙不白、際此惡劣環境、深恐不良份子、冒充掮客、晤中有非法賣買之舉、特勸吿各掮客自動暫停賣　三天、以淸涇渭、俾各界明白掮客之地位與人格、所以全市營業更在一般不顧民食之米蠧把持現貨之下、形成半停頓狀態、除由彼行客直接交易開出八十五元之一號暹邏外、現米均無正式市價、即回籠期貨亦以執貨者居奇堅守之故、全日成交祇有二三百噸、即行號直接配客者現米亦不逾千包、不限價之敏黨開八十八元、洋元八十九元至八十六七元則已續加二元矣、暹邏一號及米菉蕪秈等少數點綴、均係中次敷衍而已、期貨新交易無船未妥、足爲執貨抬高之口舌、實則時局漸漸緩和、保險行昨午通知將中國海口往馬尼拉新加坡南洋各地保費减低百分之五十、水險减爲百分之一、但此輩只知利已、不顧大局之米商囤戶、又將利用泰越之戰事復作、大抬特抬共米價、居心險惡、幸災樂禍、較之明火執仗打刦、還要兇狠十倍、公會儘管聯席會議、無非多占幾行報紙新聞地位、其所爲益於民食者如何、但看目下之米市、即可知其徒事搪塞而巳、至調査囤戶存米、亦無非敷衍一番、待風頭過去、即又放下不理、米市糟到如此地步、正爲吃米的爲數百萬中國人、故無辦法、昨期貨新交易未妥、回籠開二三月小絞九十二元、二月份又九十一元半、混合碎六十九　至六十八元六角、均與前市相似、然貨主只望圖利、尙不肯售出云、</p>
<p>洋米來源旺盛、連日不斷到埠、迭誌本報、上星期六由港抵滬之渣華公司芝根第號輪、亦有洋米七千餘包自港運來、停靠浦東藍烟囱碼頭起卸、前日（星期日）太古公司安順輪到滬、由香港裝來三千一百包、綏陽輪同日抵滬、亦由香港裝來五千七百六十一包、另有苞米一千三百四十一包（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨轉旺、而以價格一再高漲昂貴已極、銷塲頓亦平常、所以昨市呈無榮無辱局面、開崑山原白粳仍爲一百十元、斛見百零五六元、特別百零七元、靑角薄稻斛見百零二元、百零一元半、</p>
<p>糯米市貨旣稀、而又一般四戶以不受限、故遂都着手於此、繼在吸收、致價續漲二元有奇、開香港特元八十八元、中八十六元、</p>
<h3>粉市先疲後穩—定麥一船將到—</h3>
<p>麵粉　日昨粉市、先疲後穩、上午開盤、因香港轉口粉逐有運到、途貨洋粉麥預計月底均可如期運滬、人心已趨平軟、鐘樓牌澳粉初開二十五元五角半、美麗牌廿五元七角至七角半、均比上週末軋小角許、惟下午局勢稍緊、良以米價邁進、及華廠平賣粉尙米恢復供應、本街實銷頗稱不惡、花鳥粉價由廿五元五角半硬至七角半、成交額計一萬餘包、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市堅靜如故、査內地來源依然寥洛、而廠定洋麥一船、已接途次來電、平安裝出、大致月底可以抵埠、華廠原料、正待洋麥接濟、對於杜麥進胃、亦不貪取、日廠吃盤重視、限價不願再放·故鬥市亦屬無貨可收、市面沉寂異常，</p>
<h3>金融金市刺激回騰絕猛接連上升出六千二百元關現貨更昂高於期貨五百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、先頗平疲、後則直衝雲霄接連出六千一百元與一百元關外、最高挺升至六千二百四十元、爲日前大跌後最猛烈之回風、乃因連日某行方面在市吸收現黃余甚多、更造作聲勢、搖動人心、無知者羣起購進、遂由六千一百元內、漸晋至六千一百四十元、本日以同康永成記及銀號幫搜人最夥、鑫元等傾向售出、散戶亦有了結、晚收價爲六千二百二十五元、比上星期六軋升一白十元、掉期二月轉入三月、賣方貼出四十五元、少成交、現金初由熾人售予祥和十十兩、價照期交高四百七十元、恒記出德孚五十兩高四百八十元、又出祥和竇康各七兩、高五百元、福康永出德孚叫十兩、高五百十元、下午永成出祥與永五十兩、仍高五百十元、最高九百元、無買戶、首飾金步升二十元、達六百九十元、關金等均平云</p>
<h3>全日漲二百十元</h3>
<p>晨動以人心觀望、開盤時　戶缺乏、致告撳跌二十五元、爲六千〇八十元、開後一度升至六千一百元、但爲時甚暫、即被鑫元等猛拋、而重向下降、卒低至六千〇七十元、賴大豐永同康永及滙票商等聯袂收購、走勢向上、即被拉出六千一百元關外、曾挺至六千一百十五元、斯時散戶乘高、頓萌賣意、價遂轉疲、盤旋中復進六千一百元內，挫至六千〇八十八元、迨至午收、市面稍定、結果吿六千〇九十五元、午後開盤仍乏生色、計爲六千〇八十五元、嗣報外滙轉緊、公大同康永成記等一致買進、抬高至六千一百九十五元、而新豐永有售、止漲稍回、退逹六千一百六十五元、終以外滙軟化、銀號幫天元等掀動買風、爲數相當互大、遂見在升出六千二百元外、達六千二百四十元頂峯、晚收結果、仍爲六千一百二十五元、比上星期六收市價軋漲一百十元、全日上落一百四十元、現金號之本牌金售價、比烚赤期交高五百元、烚赤（現貨）高十餘元、收　低二十元、現標金照掛牌余低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金六百九十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每　兌出價、午後二時二十五分掛六百八十元、叫時又升十元、結果大同行懸六百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元、</p>
<h3>外匯動盪鬆即又轉緊</h3>
<p>外滙作日市况、匯營掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、鬆動之中、卒吿走緊、先聞日洋行扒納、繼於港電投機商等結進下、遂步軟化、美滙本月份成交價出五元六五六二五、退至五九三七五、且迄晚收、現貨美滙已達五元五六二五、比上週六收市價縮〇九三七五、英匯走勢稍緩、現貨收盤價爲三辦士四三七五、軋緊〇一五六二五、</p>
<p>日商洋行結進</p>
<p>晨初以匯兌英對美滬等均平、美對英滬等無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士四五三一二五、美匯五元六五六二五、與上週末收市價相同、期貨亦平、開後外商銀行售出美滙、而英行有利仍富吃胃、雖鬆亦微、計現美滙成交價爲五元六八七五、九點半滙　掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅亦無變動、投機家尙有賣意、計拋予經紀行掮客三月份美匯爲五　六五六二五、延至午刻、交易轉淸、收盤價現貨美匯爲五元六五六二五、英滙三辦士四五三一二五、</p>
<p>港方亦有吸收</p>
<p>後市初開仍帶硬化、因投機商續售美滙、計三月份由某美行吸入價爲五元六五六二五、嗣以上述流言甚熾、先見日洋行來扒、計本月份美匯由外行售予價爲五元六二五、且港電亦進、本月份美匯乃由五元六五、做至五九三七五、傍晚尤俏、結果現貨及本月份美匯吿五元五六二五、英匯三辦士四三七五、下月份美匯五元五三二五、英匯一辦士四二八一二五、比上星期六牧市價、英滙期現微緊〇一五六二五、焚匯縮〇九三十五、</p>
<p>香港美匯起伏</p>
<p>香港　十九日（週一）電、今晨滙市開始平定、各滙　無榮辱、（按上週六午收，美滙現貨回緊至二十四元三七五、申匯現貨亦升至四百三十二元、）　時五·五分、美匯現貨鬆〇六二五、爲二十四元四三七五、十一時三十分吿平、美滙現貨續硬〇六二五、爲二十四元半、其餘不動、午收美滙現貨重緊〇六二五、爲二十四元四三七五、申匯現貨升五角、爲四百三十二元五角、其餘不動、下午停市、</p>

<h3>證劵內債補空　—英美商行派息二起—</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市因補空而稍稍回好、市况見堅、因環境上謠言孔多、有者竟至莫知所從、市塲買賣、尙稱熱鬧、上午信孚又來買進、順昌獨垂靑丁種、聯益潤和易中及三十八號均有買進、聯和信昌增孚大通及怡泰均有賣出、午收即回好四五角至九角、午後協興源又有吃胃、信孚繼續買進、聯和德隆均有抵補、賣方又比較熱鬧、大通協康永康先出後入、胡鶴記永昌益昌及三十五號均有賣出、市塲人氣又振奮不起、丁戊種又略轉疲、收盤後賣出爲多、又小數角、市價結果、一致回好四角半至九角、惟丁種及九六略小五分、成交的計二百四五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花紗銷無大發展市面徘徊粗絨棉較爲活動</h3>
<p>紗市中疲、大勢情形仍居盤旋之境、蓋以環境平淡、致多頭心意渙散、同時實際交易、雖尙有零星採辦、堪以維持、然因航運困難已量發展、仍鮮希望、所以市面亦呈超趄不前之狀、二十支雙馬最高價爲一千二百八十元、低價爲一千二百六十二元、午後價爲一千二百七十五元、繼以金價上升、人氣頓見熱烈、漲全一千三百〇八元、最後價爲一千三百〇四元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開平庸、因遠東局勢尙在動盪中、以致人心恍惚、首盤價爲一千二百八十元、此價一開、買者少而賣者多、市情徐徐而下、至一千一百六十五元、旋聞外匯寗靜、金價下趨、人心軟化，惟以空頭稍補、又升至一千一百七十二元、中途因現紗交易不旺、續鬆至一千二百六十一元、但多方大都觀望不動、收盤時又見回好至一千二百七十二元、査半日間成交、統計五千五百四十五包、二十五日有紗一百三十件運暹邏、二百十件運杳港、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>現棉情况較堅、但實需尙屬平庸、惟粗絨精較爲活動、情以外匯改編、人心轉昂一步、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、星期六爲美國例假、棉市休業、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因歐洲出口商買進及空頭掛補而漲、繼又因問情於純金　貴、更見堅定、昨日連同預測、高漲二羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易，市况尙屬緊定、零星成交差堪　開、雖各方購意尙欠活躍、伹以原棉脚地堅實、且近日進口外棉亦不擁擠、短期內棉市或有發展希望、</p>
<h3>疋頭廠布大批開出—市價乃得枚小—</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢平穩、大街染廠對於廉額坯布續有吸納、各布廠供給甚爲充裕、永安廠開售三月份大鵬細布每疋價四十一元、普通十二磅細布價在三十八元至三十九元、共開出五六百件、售盤呈廻旋狀態、白貨細布斜紋晨跌二角半至五角、午後回平、粗布重磅平平、九磅布每疋漲二角半、漂染布一部份每疋漲五角之譜、本街成交各布八百餘件、浙閩幫辦色布漂布二白餘件、粵港幫辦色布色斜府綢等三百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　咋市廻旋上騰、售盤續挺、白貨龍頭細布則以投機商心思淡溥、轉呈平庸、每疋漲二角半、收盤爲四十五元二角半、而中檔細布如彩球飛魚因實需激增、已與龍頭並駕齊驅、每疋續漲七角半之譜、後市喊盤俱在四十五元一二角矣、色貨嗶嘰、亦緣根子緊俏、提升至一元二角五分牛、</p>
<p>出　疋頭今（二十五日）有五十件運往天津、又一百件運烟臺、七白四十件運杳港、八十五件運暹邏、</p>
<h3>單面花呢暢銷</h3>

<h3>油餅投機操縱荳油續漲元半</h3>
<p>昨日豆油市續見上騰、大勢自上週開始局部迂迥前進以來、仍處樂觀之中、原因不脫操縱掌握、市風祇見上升、不似豆餅漲跌倐忽、昨現大連油成交一百桶、價爲一百廿元至一百十九元半、漲一元半、及訂三月上一百五十桶、價仝現油市、又訂三月下五十桶、價爲一百一十尤零五角、四月上交三百桶、價爲一百二十一元五角至一百二十元零七角半、復至一百二十一元二角半、花生油站定、成交購州油五十件、價爲一百零六元五角、靑島油三十桶、價爲一百四十七尤、烟茶聽裝油三百聽、價爲一百四十元、</p>

<p>荷糖大批到滬、渣華郵船公司芝楂運加號郵船、及芝根第號輪兩輪、均於上星期六日下午抵滬、由爪哇運來砂糖四千一百噸、的四萬一千包、又前日（廿三日）太古公司安順輪抵滬、由香港裝來砂糖一百一十包、綏陽輪同日到埠、亦由香港運來糖二百包、（祖）</p>
<p>昨因到貨見增、來源暫無問題、故人心漸軟、續趨下降、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧初爲八十元、旋鬆至七十九元八角至五角、比廿二日小一元三角、三月十日打單八十元八角至三角、小五角、二十日打單八十元九角至六角、荷赤六十一元半至六十一元、小一元太古車白B嘜西棧八十元半、後降至七十九元半、小一元三角、東棧七十九元、DY嘜西棧七十八元半、HX嘜七十八元、均小一元、</p>
<h3>煤炭烟煤行盤日高</h3>
<p>烟煤生意、依然沉寂、售價堅昂、續趨前進、蓋以存貨日見短絀、加之水脚迭昂、合價日高、同業搜羅、行客囤藏、行盤步步上升，昨開同行拆價、開　火車塊與噸二白十二元、煤屑一百六十元、婆羅洲烟煤二百零五元、棧房出貨、駁船上水外加、</p>
<h3>南北貨桃肉核桃俱有售開</h3>
<p>天津桃肉、昨開出頭路貨一千包、品質較高、價爲二百十九、又臺州核桃一百九十七包、價爲六十元、如數開通、惟尙存五百外包、貨品較遜、猶米脫手、</p>
<p>木耳迭見新高價</p>
<p>黑木耳因來源乏到、號貨甚爲居奇、故春市一再上展絕無鬆勢、近日升度愈速、迭見新高價、飛漲不已、初開七百二十五元、昨少數更跳至七百五十元、</p>
<h3>經濟業譚</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>鐘表漏刻（續）</p>
<p>惟其是檯鐘，放在格上，好淘氣的女孩子，就會去攫弄，如五十八同中芳官將時辰鐘弄壊了。</p>
<p>「襲人笑道，方纔胡嗓了一陣，也不留心聽得幾下鐘了。晴雯笑道：這撈什子（按即指時辰鐘）又得去收拾。說着拿過表來瞧了一瞧。麝月笑道：提起淘氣來，芳官也該打兩下兒，昨日是擺弄那堅子，半日就壊了。」</p>
<p>所謂堅子，即指鐘擺。當時雖有鐘表，而其報時，不似現在之稱某點某分，仍是用老法稱某時某刻某分。如四十五回中云：</p>
<p>「黛玉道：我要歇了，你請去罷，明日再來。寳玉聽了，回首向懷內掏出　個核桃大的金表來瞧了一瞧，已指到戍末亥初之間。」</p>
<p>又如十九回去中云：</p>
<p>「寳玉襲人正說着，只見秋紋走進來說，三更天氣了，該睡了；方纔老太太打發嬤麽來間，我答應睡了。寳玉命取表來看時，果然鍼已指到亥正。」</p>
<p>又如六十三回中云：</p>
<p>「衆人因問幾更了，人回：二更以後了，鐘打過十一下了。賣玉猶不信，要過表來熊了一瞧，已是子初二刻十分了。」</p>
<p>有謂表上數字只從一至十二爲止，偏要記時刻，未免於看時間要多一番換算時刻功夫，所言良是。但舊時鐘表，儘有機件是洋貨，而鐘表之面有在中國裂造，仍列子丑實卯辰已午未申酉戍亥十二時於其上，分爲二十四小時者。余幼時尙習見此種鍊表，故寶玉之表，能不假思索，說出子初刻十分，焉知不爲此表亦列有十二時辰之故歟！</p>
<p>至於自嗚鐘形狀，如九十二回中馮紫英向賈政兜售之自嗚鐘，有三尺多高，內有一個小童，拿着時辰脾，到了什麼時候，他就報什麽時候，裹頭也有些人在內打十番的。與渶宮春曉的圍屛，共賣五千兩銀子。又王鳳姐有一座金自嗚鐘，拿去賣了五百六十兩銀子，此可見當時鐘的價値一斑。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>小波瀾</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>在這一般人把飛機炸彈大砲的罪惡，不分皂白地亂推在「科學」身上的今日，卡爾遜敎授的「科學無罪論」，倒是一服對症下藥的淸凉劑。</p>
<p>世界在進步着，也將一直進步下去，這是一個無法推翻的眞理。</p>
<p>人類的文明是一股永遠在向前衝進着的洪流，任何龐大的反動勢力，都無法使它向後轉，因爲文明主潮的趨勢，總是向前推進的。</p>
<p>歷史上容或偶有一時期被黑晤所籠罩着，可是這祇是洪流中所必有的小波瀾而已，對於整個歷史的動向，是沒有阻碍的。</p>
<p>在這動亂的時代中，我們更應該有着這種對於進步的緊信。</p>
<p>思想</p>
<h3>科學無罪</h3>
<p>— 徐模</p>
<p>人類的文明愈進步，愈有人指摘科學，詛咒科學。科學究竟是不是罪有應得呢？最近美國芝加哥大學敎授卡爾遜在一次演說中發表替科學辯護的意見。他以爲科學木身絕沒有缺點，絕沒有損害人類的惡意，但是世人誤解了它，誤用了它，因之就造成了種種的罪惡。所以這完全是人類自取之咎。現代的人享受着科學給與我們的好處，所看到的只是一些應用科學的工業和新發明，對科學的眞髓却一無所知，我們都不能把科學的原理　用到日常的生活。現代即使是最偉大的人物也往往抱着傳統的歡念，他們應用科學化思想的能力，實際上並不比幾百萬年前的「北京原人」有若何顯著的進步。</p>
<p>卡爾遜敎授認爲這種科學的失敗，分析起來可以有下面三個主要的原因：</p>
<p>第一，現代的敎育太側重於背誦的方式。從家庭中的幼年時期以至於大學畢業，孩子們差不多都是始終的在讀死書：他們並不能學習到探究眞理和實際體騐的精神。「你能够敎一只鸚鵡講拉丁文，但會購拉丁文的鸚鵡依舊不過是只鸚鵡呀！」卡爾遜以爲現代的敎育制度實在太糟了。</p>
<p>第二，現代的科學家大都愈學愈專門，愈專愈狹窄，結果差不多都要鑽到牛角尖裏面去，但是當他跑到自己的圈子外面來時，就也跟不知科學爲何物的匹夫匹婦一樣地充滿着浮躁的感情，和偏狹的成見。科學家缺乏良好的修養就很容易不自覺地做了人類的罪魁。</p>
<p>第三，人類的本性自有一種抵抗新思想，新生活的頑固力量。幾千年來宗敎用盡誘惑或威脅的方法，要使人走上爲善的路，結果尙且不易使他們就範，歷史幼穉的科學自然更難有滿意的成績了。</p>
<p>事勢雖是如此，我們却用不着沮喪或悲觀，卡爾遜敎授的結論說：</p>
<p>「我們得承認，一百萬年來人類始終是在漸漸進步，他們的理解力在豐富起來，恐懼和　恨在漸漸闢除，他們比從前來得更良善，更要體面，更知道尊重正義和人道。漸漸地但是必然地，科學的方法將使我們的生活日趨理智和快樂；痛苦和流淚的事將離開這個人世。也許在某時或某地，强暴的行爲，瘋在侵略的戰爭會使科學眞理的追求受到阻礙，因而使它沉沒了，被遺忘了，但我相信它必能被重新發掘出來，在一個更進步的時候，那時有着更優秀的人類。」</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（四）意外的遇合</p>
<p>「…咱們早知道姓馬的玩意兒太差，叫你們不要去的他，偏是你們不信，父把他帶了來。你瞧上台這麼幾大，他可曾吃過一聲采沒有？」一條怪尖的嗓子，在樓上喊着，玉崑走到半扶梯，就知道是沈麻子在那裏說話了。</p>
<p>「我們原想打電報到上海去把劉玉華的來的，只是他要的價錢太大了…」說話的聲音很低，又且很糢糊，充滿着重濁的痰音，一聽就知道是秋海棠的頭兒趙四。</p>
<p>「吳老板自己不能少拿幾個嗎？」沈麻子很不客氣的說。</p>
<p>秋海棠住的六號房間差不多就在扶梯口，玉崑一七樓，便歪斜着脚步，推開了門闖進去</p>
<p>「什麽大驚小怪？」他故意半睜着醉眼，假裝莫名其妙地問。</p>
<p>沈麻子正在生氣的時候，突然瞧見這麽一個衣衫不整，半像叫化子的人闖進來，大模大樣的說話，心裏不覺老大不高興，雖然看他的行徑也是個唱戲的，却總道是個不關重要的配角，便略略瞟了他一眼，並不招呼，依舊跟秋海棠和趙四兩個人說話。</p>
<p>「再說吳老板，你也有些不够交情！」沈麻子把半個屁股靠在一張方檯上，捋起了衣袖，綳緊着滿臉的橫肉，顯得像一個討債的人一樣。「咱們前台排定的戲，十次倒有九次給你回掉的。什麽戲唱，什麽戲不唱，眞比娘見們還認眞！道樣還能不叫咱們賠本嗎？」</p>
<p>秋海棠唱了幾年戲，倒把胆子唱得小了許多，從前在科班裏的時候；他倒還歡歡使使小性，現在自己成了班，便祇剩了給人家打拱作揖的份兒，再也不敢得罪一個人。此刻當着這一個滿身光棍氣的沈麻子，自然格外無法對付了！</p>
<p>「沈老板，這裏頭也有一層困難。」還是那個又矮又胖的趙四胆量比較大一些。「不要說像盤絲洞那一類的戲，咱們吳老板萬萬不能唱；就是別的玩笑戲，也因爲裏頭有一個袁七爺的緣故…，」（三九）</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>愉快的生活</h3>
<p>— 梁英</p>
<p>「苦嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，這生活是愉快的。」妻堅强地笑起來。</p>
<p>流浪到孤島上來，一霎哏已經三年了。</p>
<p>幸運之至，到滬後不久，就找到了一家文化機關裏的工作，妻也在一個小學裏擔任敎師。於是，我們竭力忘却在遙遠的地方的被毀的家，在孤島的一角，又建起我們的家來。</p>
<p>物價天天向上爬，經濟的魔掌緊緊地扼住我；三年來，用我們低微的薪給，仝生活搏鬥。然而，我們的生活是挺愉快的。</p>
<p>早上，妻提了水吊上老虎灶，早餐是油花生佐泡飯，或大餅油條豆漿。裝飽了肚子，我們就離開家，工作去。</p>
<p>通例，妻回家比我早半小時。當我熟習地跨進寓所的弄堂時，陰冷的心，便溫暖起來·在沿弄堂的玻璃窗上輕輕地敲幾下，妻便像小烏似地跳着迎出來；露着稚氣的笑，接取我手中的東西。於是這小小的二十塊錢一月的灶披間，够忙亂啦。妻熟練地燒菜煮飯，我幫着妻提水，爐子上添煤球。一小時後，我們便很安適地愉快地同進晚餐。晚上我們同到外面散步去。在耀眼的夜光中，我們投進了白熱化的人羣，領略這都市的夜的風貌；一會兒，我們又走在幾條靜謐的馬路口了，淸凉的夜風裏，有妻的銀鈴似的笑語聲。有時候，在暗弱的燈光下，寫一點文稿；妻坐在寫字檯旁結着絨錢，偶爾二對眼光碰着時，交換一個無聲的祝福。而每星期三，我們是去出席一個朋友處的座談會。</p>
<p>四年前，就是我們結婚的那年春天，我們還有一個挺熱鬧的家；可是這家是毀滅在砲火裹了。這血的敎訓，我們會忘却嗎？偶爾同妻談起了前年的情况，不免有一陣感想；然而，我們並不傷感，更不去追憶過去美好的夢。妻常常說：『要不是戰事毀了家，我們沒有懂得這許多事。同祖國一樣，過去的三年，並沒有浪費，我們接觸了各階層的人物，體味到了從前沒有想到的事，學得了更多的生活智能。同祖國一樣，眼前雖然艱苦一點，而我們是面對着光明的。」並且，我們現在不是很愉快嗎？</p>
<p>有時候，我們很想到內地去，可是籌不到這一筆路費。不過，上海雖成了孤島，至少也是我們國土的一部份，孤島上也留着許多要我們去做的事。祇要我們緊守着自己的崗位，艱苦　幹下去，無負於祖國，無負於自己的良心！</p>
<h3>靈魂的養氣</h3>
<p>— 沈浮</p>
<p>在我們的一生中，總有些成功的事，這些成功多半是從旁人的鼓勵而獲得的。</p>
<p>鼓勵是靈魂的養氣。假若沒有鼓勵，你別想一個工人會有良好的工作。沒有鼓勵，沒有人會有生趣地活下去。</p>
<p>留　吧：在你鼓勵了一個人之後，你是如何地感覺愉快！那麽，切莫錯過給人以鼓勵的機會。George　MatthewAdams語</p>

<h3>卓別麟夫婦觀「獨裁者」</h3>
<p>— 期平</p>
<p>二年來，這位天才的笑匠聚精會神地在攝製他的新片，現在已完成了。當「大獨裁者」在紐約Astor大戲院作處女獻映時，卓別麟翩然蒞臨，因此片之成功與吾，他本人之急於分曉，比仟何觀衆都盼切啊！</p>
<p>卓別麟以其足以炫惑人的崇高地位和獨特的演技每一作品問世，必能閧動社會。當他的「摩登時代」在紐約初映時，警務當局曾爲之大忙特忙，百老匯大街擠得水洩不通，車輛行人，阻塞於途，泰晤士方塲上，大羣工人因情緒緊張而不守秩序，警局釉員百人去阻止他們，可見當事狀况熱烈的一般。</p>
<p>「大獨裁者」初映之夜，其盛况自不遜於付昔，卓別麟偕其愛妻寳蓮高黛翩然蒞臨，很多人竟衝越警察的　綫而想一瞻風采。「大獨裁者」係在Astor和Cattol二大戲院同時獻映，這晚上的紐約最高社交界的宴遊節目中，往觀此片就成爲必需之事，二大戲院的座上幾全部爲幸運的孩子們和他們在「華爾街」辦事的父親們，以及高貴女賓所佔據，眞是峨冠燕尾，盛飾華服，交相顯映。卓氏和演另一獨裁者賈克奧凱等來觀此片，却爾斯勞頓和夫人伊莎蘭吉士　，滴在紐約，亦來參與，進院時爲攝影記者所包圍。</p>
<p>影評界所給予「大獨裁者」的一致意見爲「與其說是卓別麟的又一成功作，無寗說是他的最偉大作品。」紐約時報則譽爲「一個現實的大藝人所產生的一部現實的眞美善作品。」他們以爲卓氏四年前在「摩登時代」中佈下了對大量生產和使工人爲機械的奴隸底怨懣，今在「大獨裁者」中，佈下了對獨裁制度的盡量是揶揄鄙責，而寄人民以無限同情；他的作品的價値，是不能僅僅以「供人引爲笑料」去估計的。</p>
<p>「大獨裁者」即將在倫敦上映，紐約盛傳卓氏將獲得賣座收入的白分之七十，倫敦方面，亦將提高座價，像開映「亂世佳人」時一樣；但卓氏予以吾認，聲明他的收入不會超過百分之五十，因之漲價一事也爲無稽之談。他希望此片能在倫敦延長開映時日，並同意能百數家戲院同時放映。他相信此片含有深意，而爲極好的宜傳品，英國觀衆不僅可以欣賞它，而且英國人獲得它的助益。</p>
<p>撲朔迷離又傳破裂</p>
<p>寳蓮高黛和卓別林的婚姻，由秘密而成公開之後，現父謠傳二人之間已有裂痕。事實是：一月間英國名作家威爾期到美時，卓別林曾在自己家裹設宴款待，寳蓮高黛並在旁勸酒。但威爾斯走過之後，沒有幾天，寶蓮就搬到海濱別墅裏去住，卓別林則搬到福羅麓姐去，裂痕云云，如此而已。（黃新德）</p>
<h3>譚稽古社科班</h3>
<p>— 李雲影</p>
<p>在戰前國內科班署名者，亦僅有富連成，戲曲學校·不料事變後，科班竟會如此的發逹。尙小雲辦了個榮春社。李萬春接着又辦了個嗚春社。這兩個科班，在平已佔有相當的地位。於是天津又有稽古社的產生。該班合辦人是四位。現在祇剩下高星橋（爲動業塲主人）和遜淸王府某王爺兩股了。此外請了個外行主事人高的長子渤海。不過，像一酒丐」，「白泰官」，「崔猛」這類的戲，亦都常貼，上座並且眞不壊。實在是由敎師們在富連成樓來的。但有時又排西遊記一路海派佈景戲，這點到很使人失望。說到這兒，我們應該再檢討一下他們社內的敎師，現在容我略誌於後：</p>
<p>尙和玉是一生被小樓壓在十九層地獄下的，從來就沒大紅太紫過，在平亦不過連敎帶唱，所以稽古社把他請到天津担任敎授。還有一位李吉瑞，（可惜到社不久即逝世）在社方亦不過用他們來號召觀衆罷了。實在還不是全由屢廷玉（尙之下手）一手包辦嗎？至於程永龍，李蘭亭，是該社薪金最大的，亦不過敎了兩齣十二本鐵公鷄，八九本三門街。劉喜義在富社亦曾經執敎有年，他是個英雄出身（即戲班中之班底），像「夜奔」「神州擂」還好；至「長板坡」「十字坡」就不行了。韓富信技藝雖佳，而戲路不寬，祇能敎「武文華」「趙家樓」「艷陽樓」等戲見長。可是，總比博而不精的屢廷玉略勝一籌敎旦角的王雲卿（即王多芬），其藝較諸茹香還不如。授生行的閻喜林，玩意還好，入社爲日不多，地位亦不高。其餘還有周蓮芳（敎旦）鄭少恒（敎生），唐蓮詩（敎老旦），劉振林（敎丑），馬少山（敎小生），藝均平平，無佳可取。倘該社再小另聘名師，長此以往恐終難收效吧？</p>
<h3>罷工在好萊塢嘉寶人老珠黃不值錢</h3>
<p>— 胡凡芳</p>
<p>唔女郞安秀雙丹在華納週薪是七百五十元（當然是美金），可是她認爲不滿，最近拒絕拍戲。聞唔女郞的要求，是每週一千五百元，華納已有「准如所請」的表示，但在「罷工」期間，有一部由唔女郞主演的片子，因不能久擱，業由麗泰海華絲担任。</p>
<p>愛麗絲費也有類似「罷工」的表示，「紅花艷曲」本是她的戲，因她表示不幹，才臨時改請了蓓蒂葛竇蘭。誰知蓓蒂一演而紅。愛麗絲費眼看自己地位不穩，急忙退讓，於是與蓓蒂合演「仙樂街」，但兩人仇怨，則愈結愈深，甚至見面時不交一談，福斯當局有鑒於此，乃選新本二部，由二人各自單獨主演，愛麗絲費的新片是Rcad　To　Rio　The　Great　American　Broadeast，誰的「苗頭」足，只有待事實來分曉了。</p>
<p>葛蘭泰嘉寳雖然不曾人老珠黃不値錢，但她每部片的「包銀」已大爲减低。米高梅最近以十五萬元的代價，要她拍新片一部，嘉實業已尤諾，如在三年以前，則非三十萬不辦·聞新片男主角爲威康飽惠爾，片名未定。</p>
<p>泰羅飽華主演「實劍留痕」後，大受觀衆讚美，福斯公司已請他主演西班牙文學名著「血與沙」，按默片時代，此片係由范倫鐵拿主演。</p>

<h3>自影城來的消息</h3>
<p>— 惠霖</p>
<p>好萊塢的電影新聞記者們曾於去年年底舉行了一次非正式的藝人選舉，結果是這樣的：詹姍士賈克奈被選爲好萊塢最富有天才的男演員，蓓蒂黛維絲被選爲最富有天才而且有最佳演技的女演員；此外保羅茂尼和凱塞玲赫本亦被鄭重贊賞。凱塞玲退出銀壇已久，係去年作東山再起之　的。</p>
<p>以菲洲爲背景的那張十巨片之一的「萬里尋師」中有許多菲洲土人的方言，叫做「史華赫里」的一種語言，在菲洲是很廣泛地流行的。一十世紀福斯公司當局曾宣稱：在世界上除了英文和中國交是最普遍外，其次要算是史華赫里語了。</p>
<p>約翰巴里摩亞現在芝加哥舞台上演劇，據說曾因過於疲乏而暈倒，他的朋友急忙送他到醫院中去，經過一番手續後乃立即出院。假使的翰再要堅持每天須欲自登台兩塲，那末他的健康將更受打擊的。他最近和妻子離婚，演劇而又不支，眞可以說是禍不單行了。</p>
<p>近來好萊塢明星中駕駛汽車闖禍的人很多，例如埃洛爾茀林曾偕其妻拉麗黛米泰同乘車出外時，因埃洛爾失却控制力將車頭撞入一座磚牆內，醫生們起初認爲他傷勢頗重，後來僅發現他臉上及臂部略有傷處而已。同時不久前，李却葛林也從醫院中出來，原來也是爲了馳車出的亂子呢。不過，這些事情還不希奇，因爲三年前華雷斯皮萊曾因駕駛飛機而受傷。</p>

<h3>Ceasefire Extended for Ten Days; Both Thailand and Vietnam Prepare for Renewed Conflict; Vietnamese Army Headquarters Moves from Hanoi to Saigon; Military Vehicles Constantly Moving towards the Thai Border</h3>
<p>Saigon – Yesterday, Japanese sources stated that the French Indochinese military authorities had cancelled all leave for officers and soldiers, ordering them to return to their posts. Reportedly, this move was the result of a meeting held last Friday by senior military officials, who decided to continue the war and prepare to return to Hanoi today. According to Japanese sources, Major General Degoutte hopes to move the Army Headquarters from Hanoi to Saigon, while also preparing to move the Southern Vietnamese Army Command from Saigon to Cambodia to organize new defense measures. Meanwhile, well-informed and authoritative sources say that although there are many points of contention in the Thai-Vietnamese negotiations in Tokyo, they have not yet broken down. Military and political authorities have expressed hope to resolve the disputes before the ceasefire agreement expires tomorrow. However, they are closely monitoring the situation and have indicated that if Thailand insists on its demands, they are prepared to take military action. (United Press report, 24th)</p>
<p>Saigon – Authoritative sources announced today that the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire, which was due to expire tomorrow, will be extended until March 7th. According to Japanese eyewitnesses, since Saturday, military vehicles have been continuously moving towards the Thai border. A French cruiser left Saigon yesterday, and two others sailed out last Saturday, presumably heading for the Gulf of Siam. (United Press report, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Tonight, the Information Bureau issued a public statement announcing that the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire agreement has been extended for another ten days, until March 7th. It is reported that after the third informal meeting of the conference mediating the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute was held at the Foreign Minister’s residence on February 7th, Japan conducted separate negotiations with representatives from both Thailand and Vietnam. Given that the ceasefire deadline was rapidly approaching and several issues required further discussion, the Japanese representative yesterday, acting as a mediator, requested both parties to extend the ceasefire until noon on March 7th. This request has been accepted by both sides. From 5:00 PM to 6:15 PM today, the representatives of the three parties held the fourth informal meeting at the Foreign Minister's residence, and the discussions were very harmonious. (Reuters report, 24th)</p>
<p>Bangkok – Government officials today predicted that the ceasefire agreement with Vietnam would be extended, and expressed confidence that a peaceful resolution could be achieved. (Saigon sources say the ceasefire has been extended to March 7th.) However, French sources here are not optimistic, predicting that France will refuse to extend the ceasefire agreement again and insisting that France will fight to the death before relinquishing its sovereignty over Vietnam. Amidst the tense atmosphere of war and peace in the Far East, the U.S. Minister to Thailand, Mr. Grant, visited the acting Thai Foreign Minister, Mr. Direck Jayanama, this morning. Unofficial sources are paying close attention to the activities of Japanese warships in the Gulf of Thailand and the actions of the Japanese army in northern Vietnam, apparently believing that the Japanese army will cross Thailand and attack Burma. (United Press report, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Reports say that the 7,294-ton cruiser "Pittsburgh" and all ships in the fleet have set sail for the Gulf of Siam. Lieutenant General Degoutte, Governor-General of Vietnam, who is currently in Saigon for routine winter inspections, is scheduled to fly back to Hanoi today. (Reuters report, 24th)</p>
<h3>Trade Negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies</h3>
<p>Tokyo – According to Japanese sources from Batavia today, despite persistent rumors in the Far East, trade negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies have established a "mutual understanding." The Japanese news agency also stated that as a result of the "understanding established by the Dutch and Japanese representatives," there is optimistic hope for the future of the negotiations. (United Press report, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reported from Xiamen that the Dutch ships that have stopped sailing in the Far East are cargo ships, while passenger ships continue to operate normally between Shanghai and Java. However, ships from Singapore to Shanghai will not stop at Xiamen. (Haitong News Agency report, 24th)</p>
<p>Bangkok – Thai officials say that whether through diplomatic steps or military attacks, the Thai flag will soon fly over Savannakhet, Khemarat, Vientiane, and other ports on the Mekong River in Vietnam. Thailand hopes for Japanese</p>
<p>Thai Officials Say Military Will Still Attack Vietnam if Mediation Fails</p>
<p>mediation to produce good results, but will continue to attack. Throughout this conflict, the Thai army has been waiting for the French army to take the offensive, making careful preparations for defense. However, it finally attacked French territory only after both sides took long-term "retaliatory actions." Military activities are extremely difficult in the dense forests on both sides of the Mekong River. On the French side, the Mekong River, one mile wide, is the first obstacle, and a range of mountains is the second obstacle, both of which can discourage attackers. Only narrow paths are passable through the vine-entangled forests, making it difficult for any but the most determined troops to pass through these obstacles. Therefore, the Thai military does not expect active warfare in this area. Only a few strategically important small towns on both sides of the Mekong River have defenses; the remaining towns are guarded only by a few policemen. The paths connecting the towns, which were originally very narrow, are now being rapidly widened and renovated. Residents of most towns have been ordered to evacuate. Ban Phon, Thailand, was the first town to be bombed by French aircraft, and civilian residences are now prohibited. Mukdahan, further south, has also been evacuated due to repeated shelling by French artillery. Nong Khai, further north, allows civilians to decide their own actions. Ubon Ratchathani, thirty miles from the border, has been bombed several times by French aircraft, and its administrative head has ordered all merchants and shop assistants to return to the city to resume business immediately, otherwise their business licenses will be revoked. The Thai army along the Mekong River receives food supplies from two locations: Udon Thani in the north and Ubon Ratchathani in the south. Both locations are railway hubs, and the French army seems to recognize their importance, having bombed them several times. There are no paved roads in eastern Thailand. Foreign troops invading Thai territory can only follow two routes: one is the highway from Pakse to Ubon Ratchathani, where there is a railway to Bangkok; the other is from Nong Khai and Ban Phon to Udon Thani, where there is also a railway. The Thai military says that troops are concentrated near Aranyaprathet, Poipet, and Trat, and believes that they can resist enemy attacks on the entire border, and if necessary, can occupy the two districts needed by Thailand within 24 hours. (United Press report, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Catholic newspaper "Yi Shi Bao" commented today on France's rejection of Japan's proposed mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, saying, "The Vichy government no longer needs to appease Japan." The newspaper strongly stated that Vichy does not need to make concessions to Japan in the Pacific region, as the military deployments of Britain and the United States in the Pacific are now complete. In the past, Japan dreamed of using Vietnam as its starting point, but Vichy's protests surprised Japan and shattered its sweet dreams. Pétain's strong measures have naturally gained some powerful backing. The Netherlands East Indies' protest against the "New Order in East Asia" and France's rejection of the Japanese-proposed peace talks have placed Japan in a dilemma in the South Seas.

<p>Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Declares Strict Monitoring of British and American Actions in Lower House</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi Tadashi, during a session of the Lower House Public Debt Committee today, commented on Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands East Indies, saying that Japan is now in an advantageous position in all aspects and has a strong army, so Japan is now able to use its diplomatic policies. Ohashi also stated that Britain and the United States have no reason to oppose Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute and Japanese-Dutch commercial negotiations, and Japan will therefore closely monitor the actions of Britain and the United States. During this morning's Lower House meeting, Ohashi also presented a statement on behalf of Matsuoka, saying that the mediation of the war was merely an incidental issue in Matsuoka's reply to British Foreign Secretary Eden. (According to British sources, Matsuoka's note to Eden stated that Japan was willing to mediate wars anywhere in the world.) The main part of Matsuoka's note was that Britain believed Japan had aggressive intentions in the south. Ohashi also stated that British Foreign Secretary Eden had raised concerns with the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu Mamoru, about news of Japanese expansion into the south spreading in Britain, and the Japanese Foreign Minister had instructed Shigemitsu to convey a reply, stating that Britain believed Japan harbored aggressive intentions towards the south, and that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact was to prevent the further expansion of the war. Ohashi generally stated that the Japanese Foreign Minister did indeed inform Eden in the reply that Japan was willing to contribute to ending wars worldwide to the extent possible, and pointed out that Japan's mediation of the Thai-Vietnamese dispute was an expression of this desire. However, Matsuoka's reply did not specify that Japan wanted to mediate the European war. Ohashi concluded by saying that Japan would make strong efforts to end the Sino-Japanese War as soon as possible. (United Press report, 24th)</p>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Criticizes British and American Policies, Saying They Only Serve to Incite Japanese Expansion into South</p>
<p>Tokyo – The "Nichi Nichi" and affiliated newspapers all published articles criticizing Britain and the United States for strengthening their defenses in the Pacific as an unwarranted provocation, and issued a warning that if Japan were forced to fight back, Guam and Singapore would be swept away. They continued that Britain's strengthening of defenses around Singapore in the face of Japan only served to incite Japan's policy of advancing into the south, and had no other benefit. They also constantly spread rumors that the situation in the Far East was deteriorating, and falsely claimed that Foreign Minister Matsuoka's letter to Eden was Japan's offer to mediate the European war. Britain's purpose in doing so was to sow discord between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The Japanese people must remain vigilant against British propaganda. (Reuters report, 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The "Central Daily News" carried a special commentary this morning, stating that the Japanese army is likely to begin its advance into the south in the spring, when the German army launches its offensive in Europe, or slightly later, but it seems inevitable that it will implement its southern advance this year. There has been much discussion about whether Japan will launch an offensive in the South Pacific. Strictly speaking, Japan's occupation of Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands, as well as its involvement in the Vietnamese-Thai dispute, are all necessary preparations for its advance into the south. Currently, discussions about Japan's advance into the south focus on the possibility of the Japanese army attacking Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, either through political and military means, but not including economic aggression. However, we can say that Japan's southern advance has already begun. Those who doubt that Japan will launch an offensive in the South Pacific base their doubts on the following reasons: (1) Japan's policy is always opportunistic. Japan will not rashly attack British territories in the Pacific unless Britain is defeated in the European war. (2) Japan's resources may have been exhausted in the war against China. (3) Soviet-Japanese relations are not completely friendly. (4) Japan's joining the Tripartite Pact may only be a form of intimidation. Japan is well aware that cooperation with Germany and Italy is not beneficial to itself. The result of Japan's joining the Tripartite Pact is to strengthen the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards Japan, and to make the Japanese people oppose this move. Since the Konoe government came to power, Japan has devoted all its efforts to achieving economic self-sufficiency, so Japan will not take any actions that involve significant risks. Furthermore, Japan's recent diplomatic actions, such as appointing Nomura to the United States, sending Sawada to the Dutch East Indies, and exchanging diplomatic representatives with Australia, all indicate that Japan does not want to go to war with Britain and the United States.

<h3>Japan Anxious About Recent U.S. Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese Vice Minister of the Navy Toyota stated in the Lower House today that although the Japanese Navy does not feel threatened by the recent actions of the United States, Japan has taken necessary countermeasures due to the circumstances. Toyota said, "The Japanese Navy, after fully considering all aspects of the current state of U.S. military preparations in the Pacific, has decided to take appropriate countermeasures." Toyota also stated that the United States is implementing military preparations with the intention of encircling Japan, as can be seen from the recent appropriation of US$4 million to fortify Guam. Guam is only 1,500 miles from southern Japan. (United Press report, 24th)</p>
<h3>Britain Enhances Burma's Defenses with Accumulated Military Supplies; Rumor that U.S. is Considering Taking Over Burma Road; Indian Youths Receive Naval Training</h3>
<p>New York – U.S. Senator Nye, a Republican from North Dakota, stated yesterday in a speech to the American Non-Intervention Committee in Chicago that the United States is considering a plan to take over the Burma Road. He also stated that the Washington authorities are now preparing to conduct large-scale naval operations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. (Haitong News Agency report, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Reliable sources from Burma say that a large amount of military supplies, accumulated in Burma for several months, were originally intended to be transported to Chongqing, but Britain is now using them to enhance Burma's defenses. (Haitong News Agency report, 24th)</p>
<p>Bombay – Four hundred and sixty-eight Indian youths are currently undergoing naval training near Karachi. Sixty of them, receiving training in artillery, engineering, and radio, have been training for eighteen months and will be incorporated into the Indian Navy. The next batch of Indian youths is currently being recruited. A Reuters correspondent visited the training ship today and saw that the trainees were well-disciplined and exceptionally diligent. (Reuters report, 24th)</p>
<p>Marseille – Renowned journalist Roland recently published an article in "L'Écho de Paris," emphasizing the strategic and economic importance of the port of Singapore, which he considers even more important than the Suez Canal. He stated that Japan has always regarded the port of Singapore as an obstacle to its advance into the south, and believes that the port threatens Japan's economy. Looking to the future, the interests of the Pacific powers will likely clash in the Strait of Malacca. (Havas report, 24th)</p>
<h3>Swiss Newspaper Examines Far East Situation; Japan Still Cautious About Soviet Union and Dares Not Advance South</h3>
<p>Geneva – The "Journal de Genève" recently published an editorial examining the situation in the Far East, stating briefly that Japan's waging war against the United States may not be beyond its capabilities, but Japanese privy councilors are well aware that this action would require the use of the country's entire fleet and the withdrawal of warships currently patrolling the Chinese coast. If Japan could determine that the Soviet Union truly harbored friendly intentions towards Japan, then Japan might disregard all risks, offend President Roosevelt, and boldly advance. While this action is possible, it is not certain, because how can Japan know that the Soviet Union will not attack Japan at a critical moment? It must be known that the Soviet air force, departing from its base at Vladivostok, can easily fly to Japan and bomb important areas. All of these factors will force Japan to concentrate all of its forces in Asia and avoid participating in an "intercontinental" war. As for the possibility of Japan mediating the current European war, since both sides of the current European war believe that victory is certain, Japan is unwilling to formally propose mediation at this time, so as to avoid the humiliation of diplomatic failure. In short, Japan must wait until one or both of the belligerent countries are exhausted and unable to continue fighting before it can offer its services as a mediator. In conclusion, Japan may have an opportunity to offer mediation in the future, because although it has signed treaties of alliance with Germany and Italy, it has not thoroughly become one of the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis morally, politically, or geographically.

<h3>U.S. to Freeze Axis Assets in U.S.; U.S. Plans to Freeze Assets If Germany Invades, Finance Minister Will Implement Immediately</h3>
<p>Washington – According to well-informed sources here last night, if Germany occupies Romania and Bulgaria, and the U.S. assets in these two countries are frozen, then U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will take strong countermeasures. It is expected that the implementation of this action will force Morgenthau to meet with the U.S. State Department, as Morgenthau has repeatedly proposed freezing the assets of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the U.S. It is understood that the State Department has pointed out that U.S. assets in Germany are greater than the assets of Germany and Italy in the U.S. It is also understood that the U.S. State Department believes that freezing the assets of the Soviet Union and Japan in the U.S. may force them to move further towards the Axis powers.

<h3>From Mussolini's Speech to the Future Offensive</h3>
<p>The "Blackshirt Duce" Mussolini has not delivered a grand speech for a long time. Unexpectedly, when the Italian army has been repeatedly defeated and there are widespread rumors that the Libyan garrison is preparing to withdraw entirely to French Tunisia, he roared again. Recalling his speech on November 18th of last year, he solemnly declared: "Conquering Greece in three months, or conquering Greece in a year, is of no importance. Fascist Italy is determined to fight to the end to avenge this insult." At that time, the extent to which listeners believed him was certainly far less than his own confidence. But now, the speech has admitted that the Italian army has been fighting unfavorably since the Battle of Taranto, but still expresses that the war against Britain will "not end until the last drop of blood is shed." At the same time, his attitude towards Germany does not resemble someone who should be on equal footing with Germany. Those throughout the world who hear his speech will almost certainly lament in unison at this person who once dominated the world, hailed as a veteran dictator, and now cannot help but feel a sense of beauty fading with age, the sun setting in the west. His words are sometimes arrogant and sometimes humble, but examining his main purpose, it is nothing more than two things: First, to comfort a part of the people and party members who have not completely lost hope in him, in order to continue to drive the masses under Fascist dictatorship, and to find ways to eliminate domestic unrest; second, to tell Hitler that Italy is still willing to accept "leadership" and continue to fight, in order to maintain his ally's trust in him and avoid the ally generating unexpected problems in light of his defeat.</p>
<p>Italy's military incompetence can no longer be concealed. Its relationship with Germany has clearly degraded from a position of equal allied countries to one of reliance on Germany. On this day when Hitler has not figured out how to effectively defeat Britain or figured it out but has not dared to act rashly, Britain is mercilessly launching a multifaceted offensive against Italy, determined not to give up until the Roman government is defeated and bows its head. At the same time, American diplomacy is cleverly attacking Italy's weaknesses. It is rumored that when American Ambassador to Italy Mr. Phillips returned to office, he presented a personal letter from President Roosevelt to the King of Italy, and there were rumors outside that Italy was preparing for a separate peace. Under these circumstances, Mussolini does have a need to try his best to "show his heart" to Hitler. What cannot be done both ways is that in this kind of public speech, he has to lower himself by half a notch and openly admit defeat.</p>
<p>Hitler does not want to feel proud of himself at this time, on the contrary, he must feel sad. He superficially claims to have two major allies: but one of them, the "boot ally" Italy, has become riddled with holes and cannot recover, and will need far more support from Germany than it can help Germany. The second "clay-footed ally" Japan is constrained by the war in China, fearful and hesitant, and refuses to set a fire for him in the South Pacific in a straightforward manner. Allies like this have made the vaunted triangular alliance into a lame axis that cannot stand up straight. Recalling that since Hitler threatened to launch a spring offensive, at least three months have passed, but it has never materialized. This kind of delay in time is a major loss for the Axis, which favors a quick decision. The reason for this is partly due to the increasing strength of the democratic front, but on the other hand, it should undoubtedly be blamed on the outward strength but inward weakness of Italy and Japan. However, it is necessary for Germany, Italy, and Japan to launch an offensive in order to break the current stalemate and save the declining trend, which is truly a situation where they are forced to act and cannot stop. At this moment when the American Lend-Lease Act is about to be established and the democratic front's joint defense movement is advancing steadily, the time that the Axis powers can still delay is "running out." At this fleeting and important moment, we believe that the current task of the democratic front is how to seize the initiative and control the situation. Yesterday's discussion called, "It is not enough to only prevent and contain the offensive that the aggressors are planning, it is necessary to fundamentally eliminate all harmful present situations and sources," we would like to reiterate this again and again to promote the attention and efforts of the democratic countries. Furthermore, closely observing the recent diplomatic and military trends of Germany, Italy, and Japan: such as Hitler's active deployment in the Balkans, preparations for launching a large-scale submarine offensive against Britain, Japan's intensified oppression of Vietnam, and the various facts of Japanese warships patrolling the Gulf of Siam, and then verifying yesterday's speech by Mussolini, in which he spoke of a separate peace and declared that he would fight to the end, it can be seen that although the aggressive front is like the end of a crossbow, it is still longing for the final blow of "joint action." Therefore, the current problem of the democratic countries is only one: to decide whether to wait for the aggressors to choose the timing of the attack, or to strike first? If they wait for them to attack, then since there is no way to know in advance where the aggressors will strike first, they cannot but consider whether the democratic front has sufficient preparation to fight on multiple fronts simultaneously if the Axis powers truly launch a multifaceted joint offensive? If not, then it is better to strike first, that is, without waiting for the other side to be ready, to defeat the relatively weaker members of the aggressive front first, at the very least to gradually weaken the strength of the other side's offensive. To put it concretely, instead of waiting for Japan to advance south, Germany and Italy to attack Greece, and the German army to strike directly at the British Isles, and then respond, why not take the initiative, seize one or two weaknesses of the other side, and severely punish them first. In fact, this kind of proactive strategy is not a very difficult or very dangerous task. In terms of the European situation, it is only necessary for the United States to immediately supply Britain with a large number of aircraft, so that Britain can seize air superiority in the Mediterranean, and then concentrate the naval, land, and air forces on both sides of the Mediterranean to strike hard at the Italian mainland and force it to surrender. In terms of the Far East, it is only necessary for the United States to quickly supply China with a large number of war materials and aircraft, so that China can immediately launch a general counteroffensive against Japan, and then jointly with Britain, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and the various territories of the British Empire, intensify the economic blockade against Japan; in this way, I am afraid that the Western Pacific can declare stability without waiting for Japan to launch its advance into the south. Although we do not want to rashly assert that the matter is easy, we dare to say that this is the only way to use relatively less cost to achieve the greatest results. We hope that all the countries concerned, especially the United States, will not hesitate any longer!</p>
<h3>Japanese Attempted Invasion of Baotou Foiled, Chinese Recapture Two Strongholds, Over 600 Japanese Soldiers Killed, Chinese Troops in Southern Henan Capture Strategic Location</h3>
<p>Xingji: At the beginning of this month, Japanese forces gathered several thousand troops in Baotou. Starting from the 9th, they allied with over a thousand mercenaries and several tanks, dividing into multiple routes to cross the river and invade. The targets were Wang Aizhao (7 kilometers northwest of Xinminbao) and Shulinzhao (southeast of Dashuwan). Chinese forces met them head-on and engaged in fierce battles in areas around Lanji Yiliang (8 kilometers northwest of Xinminbao), Yangjia Yita (5 kilometers northwest of Xinminbao), and Xidashe (12 kilometers northwest of Xinminbao). The fighting was particularly intense at Hashila Chuankou. Chinese forces destroyed eight Japanese vehicles. Until nightfall, the Japanese forces, apart from a portion that harassed and attempted to pin down the Chinese forces southeast of Wang Aizhao, mostly retreated north under cover of poison gas. On the 10th, the Japanese forces received reinforcements and attacked again, but were repelled at Wang Aizhao Dongpu and Xidashe. At the same time, troops were dispatched to attack Japanese strongholds southwest of Baotou, such as Gong'an Nansha Pan Wayao Tan, posing a significant threat to the Japanese. On the front line, starting from 6:00 AM on the 13th, Wang Aizhao and Xinminbao were besieged, and troops were divided to encircle and attack the rear of the Japanese forces. The battle continued until noon, when the Japanese formation was thrown into chaos and retreated. They only put up slight resistance near Wufushe before fleeing north. By the 14th, the Chinese forces had eliminated the remaining Japanese troops and recovered Wang Aizhao and Xinminbao, and dispatched troops to intensify the pursuit.

<p>Chongqing newspapers report that Lin Yutang, a famous Chinese author, wrote from Los Angeles, USA, that the United States is now actively expanding its aircraft manufacturing industry to aid democratic countries. Before the end of 1941, it will produce 20,000 pursuit and bomber planes for export. China should now request that a portion of these planes be transported to the Chongqing government in China, and should quickly obtain military supplies from the United States before war breaks out in the Pacific, as transportation will be hindered after the outbreak of war. Lin further stated that there is no doubt that the United States is eager to aid China. China should decide the total number of supplies needed for a general counter-offensive as soon as possible and send that number to Washington quickly.

<h3>China Tea Company Plans to Strengthen Control</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to the China Tea Company, China's annual tea production is 90,000 tons. Currently, apart from the portion for export, the company has monopolized the purchase and sale. Domestic purchase and sale are also planned to be completely controlled. This will be of great benefit to the company's financial situation, not only making up for the loss of the tea price in the loan-for-tea scheme. Therefore, the company also plans to raise a large amount of funds to lend to tea farmers to increase production. The tea farmers will repay the debt with tea. According to relevant sources, the domestic control measures are not permanent. In the future, a free trade system will still be adopted to stimulate competition. (24th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Rumor German Troops Have Crossed Danube, Will Enter Bulgaria in Two Routes to Attack Greece</p>
<p>London: The Times reported that all signs indicate that this week may be a critical moment for Bulgaria. According to a dispatch from Sofia, although the German invasion has temporarily stopped, preparations are underway for another move this week. A dispatch from Sofia today said that German troops began crossing the Danube River on Friday of last week at several locations near Ruse and Svishtov. It is heard that the number of German troops is very large, but by Saturday of last week, the German invasion suddenly ceased, and even the pontoon bridges that had been erected were removed. The reason for the German side's sudden slowdown is currently unknown. According to Communist sources, the Germans are now waiting for Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to deliver a speech on diplomatic relations in Moscow on Tuesday. However, diplomatic figures in Sofia believe that the German side is now conducting a propaganda campaign to force Greece to submit before actually entering Bulgaria. In short, the German plan implies its hope to create a kind of "silent occupation" without formally announcing its arrival. Currently, the main roads to the south of Bulgaria have been marked with German road signs. Many "instructors" have also been found at railway stations. A large number of beans, potatoes, bread, and wine have been ordered for the main areas of southern Bulgaria for next week. By that time, the Germans must have crossed the Balkan Mountains. According to a source in Sofia, once Sofia is occupied, the German headquarters will decide how to deal with Greece and whether it is necessary to take action against Turkey and Yugoslavia. At the same time, the people of Sofia are now waiting for the arrival of the German army with uneasiness. (24th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Continues Peaceful Policies with Military Force, Actively Strengthening Land, Sea, and Air Forces, Ready to Deal with Contingencies</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Pravda newspaper, in its commentary commemorating the 23rd anniversary of the Red Army's founding, stated: "The Soviet Union, relying on the strength of the Red Army and Navy, continues its peaceful policies. The flames of the Second Imperialist War have spread everywhere, but the Soviet people are still able to continue their peaceful work. This is thanks to the policies of the Lenin-Stalin Party and the strength of the Red Army. Our task is to be ready to respond to any eventuality so that the enemy's schemes cannot succeed. For this reason, we must continue to strengthen the Red Army and Navy, and improve our military knowledge. The Red Army's slogan is 'Always Forward.' Socialist industry supplies the Red Army with machinery, including tanks and aircraft. Soviet engineers and workers can meet the needs of the military. The development of the Soviet national economy has been confirmed at the 18th All-Union Congress of the Communist Party, and further development plans are being implemented. This shows that the Soviet people are determined to supply their armed forces with modern weaponry to the fullest extent." (TASS dispatch, 24th)</p>

In the past nine years, the Red Army's numbers have increased several times over, and its technical strength has increased from 3.07 to 13. According to precise statistics, from 1930 to 1940, the number of Soviet artillery pieces increased sevenfold, the number of tanks increased 43 times, and the number of aircraft increased six and a half times.

The "Aurora" and "Potemkin" were previously the only battleships in our navy, but they have been replaced by recently constructed high-speed battleships. In short, the Baltic, Black Sea, Pacific, Caspian, and Heilongjiang fleets have all been reorganized and strengthened." (TASS dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Italian Prime Minister Delivers Speech at Fascist Party Meeting Acknowledging Difficulties in Fighting Britain, but Determined to Cooperate with Germany to the End</h3>
<p>Rome - Mussolini delivered a speech yesterday at a Fascist Party meeting, telling the Italian and world peoples about the difficulties of Italy's war against the world power of Britain in the Mediterranean and distant battlefields, and expressing his confidence that Italy will achieve ultimate victory. The Italian Prime Minister's speech was broadcast everywhere. Loudspeakers were placed on all streets of Rome. When the speech concluded, cheers thundered and those listening applauded endlessly. Afterward, they sang the Fascist Party anthem. Mussolini began by saying that he came here to break the silence he had maintained, especially during wartime.</p>
<p>Italy at War</p>
<p>Not just since August, but for six years already, since January 3, 1935, it has been at war. When the Spanish Civil War broke out and Franco appealed for assistance, Italy could not turn a deaf ear. It was Italy's duty to rise and help. In fact, Italy has been at war since October 28, 1922, resisting the world of bureaucracy and the bourgeoisie. By September 1939, Italy was on the eve of war. History urged her on without allowing a moment to breathe. Therefore, Italy could not wait until the day it was fully prepared. Italy has thus hindered the enemy's large armies, preventing them from moving. In this way, it has assisted Germany in achieving its glorious victories. After France, there are still many enemies. Italy must fight them until its last drop of blood has been shed. What Italy is engaged in is ultimately a</p>
<p>Very Distant</p>
<p>difficult war. Libya is the most important military point. From October 1, 1937, to January 31, 1941, more than 14,000 officers and more than 356,000 soldiers were transported to Libya, forming the Fifth and Tenth Army Corps. More than 1,900 new-style cannons of various calibers, more than 15,500 machine guns, 11 million artillery shells, more than 100,000 rifle bullets, more than 24,000 tons of clothing, and 759 armored vehicles were transported. These numbers indicate Italy's careful preparation. The army fighting in the colony, without hope of reinforcement, is the furthest from Italy, and also what Italy cares about most. The Italians are not like the hypocritical British, and will not speak empty words, but will always tell the truth and refute any slander. The events of the past few months have only increased Italy's anger. Greece is Britain's</p>
<p>Last Bastion</p>
<p>in the Balkans. Greece is unwilling to abandon Britain's protection. Italy has no choice but to deal with it. On this point, Italy's responsible military circles are absolutely in agreement. The Italian army fighting in Albania is writing a glorious history of war. The Greek army has suffered extremely heavy losses. Spring is coming soon, and Italy's turning point will come with the spring. The British side has also suffered particularly heavy losses. The British claim of losing only 2,000 men is simply laughable. Since the Battle of Taranto, the war has indeed been unfavorable to the Italian side. However, Italy's ability to recover is extremely great. The victory or defeat of the war will be decided in the last battle. The Axis victory is absolutely certain. Britain can never win. In any case, Italy will continue with Germany to the end. The cooperation between German and Italian troops is based on a spirit of comradeship and friendship. Germany deeply knows that Italy is currently supporting 2 million troops and a</p>
<p>Large Air Force</p>
<p>and the heavy artillery force. The attitude of the German troops in Sicily and Libya is extremely complete, and worthy of being great soldiers. Germany's war strength has increased to date, and its losses in manpower and material resources are very small. Mussolini then elaborated on the following points: (1) Command is in Hitler's hands. (2) Germany's military equipment is far ahead of Britain's. (3) Almost all of Eastern Europe is anti-British. (4) The British blockade is now worthless, unlike the war from 1914 to 1918. (5) The morale of the Axis powers is stronger than that of the British side. The Axis powers are fighting for victory, while Britain is fighting for survival. Talk of a separate peace is simply absurd. Although Italian cities have been bombed, it is impossible to weaken Italian morale. (6) Britain is isolated and begging for help from the United States, but this kind of assistance must</p>
<p>Cross Germany's</p>
<p>power before it can arrive. (7) When Britain is defeated, the war will end. (8) Italy is now undertaking the main work, and its military equipment is increasing daily. This is due to the sacrifices of the workers. (9) Italy is proud to be competing with Britain, and a people with the courage to take risks are great. (10) Britain wants to defeat the Axis powers, but it must invade the mainland. This is something the British have never dreamed of. He also said that American intervention is based on the illusion of its being a democratic country, and the false claim that the Axis powers will attack the United States. In fact, the claim of invading the United States is extremely absurd and laughable. Finally, he said that the fascist Italian people should be victorious, and will ultimately be victorious, because their efforts and sacrifices are admirable. Victory and a just peace will surely belong to Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech to the Fascist Party Blackshirts yesterday afternoon at the Adriano Theater. Those present included party leaders and German Ambassador to Italy Dr. Mackensen. Mussolini's speech briefly stated that Germany and Italy are determined to move forward together on the road to victory. The Axis powers have formed a</p>
<p>Unified Front</p>
<p>to deal with one million British and Greek troops, the British fleet in the Mediterranean, and 15,000 aircraft. In addition to the air force that has already appeared in the Mediterranean, the German army has also landed in Sicily and Libya. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Broadcasts in Britain, Determined to Use All Manpower to Jointly Fight for Victory</h3>
<p>London - Australian Prime Minister Menzies broadcast a speech to the British people last night. The gist of his speech was: "The British Empire must go all out. If there is any slackness, it will not be able to win." Menzies' speech briefly stated: "In terms of the production of extremely important war materials, the British Empire and the United States are only at the beginning. Germany must already be feeling exhausted. Even after the collapse of the Italian military effort, enslaving the workers of Italian factories will not help much. If we use time day and night, then time is truly our ally. The British people must not think that they are alone. I deeply believe that not only can I represent Australia, but I can also represent the entire British Empire overseas and tell the British people that we are all helping you in this sacred war. We guarantee that we will use all our manpower, resources, and skills to fight alongside you until victory is achieved. Then, in the world where our children live, there will be a more beautiful and just day. The Australian Expeditionary Force has become a large army with four divisions of elite troops. Tens of thousands of Australian troops have already dealt a heavy blow to Rome, and now they only hope to deal a blow to Berlin as well. Thousands of Australian youths, together with their brothers from Britain and the Dominions, are participating in the air war. They will surely see air supremacy in the hands of the British Empire. Most importantly, you and we are moved by the example of the King and Queen, and the spirit you hold is not only defensive in nature. It is not enough to merely avoid defeat. There is no compromise between the two forces of darkness and light. What we seek is not a half-light, half-dark world." (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Contents of Willkie-de Valera Talks</h3>
<p>The content of the Willkie-de Valera talks, published yesterday by the Swedish capital's "London Sunday Express," has caused a great stir here. Official circles believe that it is necessary to make a clear statement. According to the report reprinted from the Dublin newspaper, Britain, with the help of Ireland, can conquer the submarine threat. There are four key points agreed upon: (1) The United States guarantees Ireland's neutrality, giving Ireland the same status as Panama. (2) Britain and the United States jointly manage Ireland's defense. (3) American ships may use Ireland's west coast. (4) Britain and the United States jointly manage the entrance and exit of the Irish Sea to protect shipping from enemy attacks. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Germany Will Launch Naval War in March-April, Hitler's Broadcast Speech on National Socialist Party Founding Anniversary</h3>
<p>London - Today is the 21st anniversary of the founding of the National Socialist Party. At 3:15 PM (11:15 PM Shanghai time), Hitler delivered a speech. His speech, as usual, first recounted the history of the Nazi movement, and severely criticized the Treaty of Versailles. Next, he expressed special admiration for the Nazi female party members. When mentioning his relationship with Mussolini, he said that he had chosen one person who would always share weal and woe, and help each other defeat the common enemy. Finally, he said that Germany will launch a naval war that the enemy will not expect in March and April, giving Britain a heavy blow. Hitler's speech lasted for an hour and a half, ending at 4:45 PM. The location was in Munich's famous beer hall. Only the National Socialist Party flag and the blood flag from the uprising were hung in the meeting place, with no other decorations. German cabinet ministers and National Socialist Party regional leaders were all present to listen. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Coolidge Arrives in Shanghai Today, Will Carry Evacuees Home Tomorrow Morning, Totaling Thousands, Many of Whom Are Renowned Figures, British Evacuation Is Actively Underway</h3>
<p>The American President Steamship Company's giant ship, the Coolidge, one of the most luxurious liners in the Pacific, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong at 1:30 PM today, docking at buoys 11 and 12. Passengers will be ferried across the river by the smaller Moller launch, and are expected to land at the Bund New Customs Wharf at 2:30 PM. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 1:30 AM tomorrow (26th), passing through Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and San Francisco, bound for Los Angeles, California, in the United States. The last small launch for sending off passengers will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 10:00 AM. It is reported that the number of American evacuees leaving Shanghai on the ship will reach around a thousand. Only a very small number are attached to the ship to go to other ports. Among the famous passengers are former Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council Nash, former Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Hembly, the editor of the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Mr. and Mrs. Gold, as well as the Vice Manager of American International Assurance Company Ries, and Mr. Yakin of the Spears Company, among dozens of others.</p>
<p>Quentin Returns to Shanghai from the Philippines</p>
<p>Quentin, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, took leave from the Council after being shot and injured by Japanese resident Hayashi Yūkichi on January 23, during the special meeting of foreign ratepayers this year.

<p>Famous Photographer Blesses China</p>
<p>American Universal Film Company news photographer Kleynukoff (originally from Russia) has been taking news photos of wars and earthquakes in the Far East for 18 years. He is scheduled to travel to the United States on the President Coolidge this Wednesday. Kleynukoff has taken photos of the 1932 Shanghai Incident, the Taiwan earthquake, and the customs and conditions of remote places such as Mongolia, Korea, and Tibet. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War at the Marco Polo Bridge in 1937, Kleynukoff went to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hankou, all the way to the French Vietnamese border, going in and out of gunfire and bullets, taking films that were highly valued by Universal Company. He was then transferred to the United States to reward his hard work. After arriving in the United States, Kleynukoff plans to travel by car to major national parks. Kleynukoff recently told reporters: "I have so many friends in China, and I can't help but feel saddened to leave. China is my second mother country. Everything I have gained has been given to me by China and its people. I respectfully wish China a happy future and wish my friends happiness and prosperity." Kleynukoff plans to study color photography and recording techniques in the United States, and then return to China to take color and sound films of places where customs and conditions have not yet been captured on camera.</p>
<p>British Evacuation Actively Underway</p>
<p>The British evacuation is superficially subdued, but is actually proceeding very rapidly, because the environment of British residents today is not the same as that of American residents. It is understood that the British evacuation involves either taking American ships to America or Canada, or taking Shanghai ships to Hong Kong and transferring to Rangoon, Singapore, Australia, and India, and other safer areas. However, on the whole, although the British say they are evacuating, they are not returning to England. There are many British colonies and British residents in various places, and various industries are busy due to the war, so there is an urgent need for more British residents to go and serve. Therefore, in recent times, many British residents in this port have gone to Singapore and Malaya to join the army. In terms of ships, although they will not follow the American example of sending special ships to welcome the evacuees, the American Mail Line, the British India Steam Navigation Company, Jardine Matheson, and Butterfield &amp; Swire, and other companies' merchant ships, can all be taken. British residents in the occupied areas have been coming to Shanghai one after another to concentrate and wait for ships to return home in batches.</p>
<h3>Easing Far East Situation, Reduction in Water Insurance Rates</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Water Insurance Association notified all member insurance companies today, according to the United Press of America's Shanghai dispatch from the 24th, that the Ru Yi De General Office has reduced the insurance rate for goods from the Chinese coast to Manila, Singapore, and India by 50%, but only for ships that do not call at Hong Kong. The original water insurance rate was 2%, but it has now been reduced to 1%.</p>
<h3>No Possibility of Soviet-Japanese Trade Agreement Being Signed, Japan Gains Nothing, Scrap Iron and Cotton Cannot Be Obtained, Future of Thai-Vietnamese Dispute Mediation Is Bleak</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury said in yesterday's editorial that the loudest noise at the moment is none other than the fanfare in Tokyo, claiming that a commercial treaty will be signed with Soviet Russia. If viewed from what Japanese officials have been boasting, it seems as if once this agreement is signed, all of Japan's economic pain can be relieved immediately, and Japan's economy can break away from the United States and become independent and self-sufficient. The future is extremely bright. But when the facts are examined, there is a great error. We certainly know that in the near future, a Japanese-Russian commercial treaty may be officially signed, but its impact on the trade relations between the two countries will be very superficial.</p>
<p>Neither Country Has Large Quantities of Goods</p>
<p>The simplest reason is that neither country has large quantities of goods to export to meet the needs of the other party. If Japanese exporters think they can transport large quantities of cotton textiles and raw silk to Siberia, they will regret it. And if anyone thinks that the scrap iron or cotton that Japan needs can be transported from Russia to Japan, that is completely a dream. The role of the future agreement, apart from official propaganda, has no other value. In the future, the two countries can declare that trade has increased by several hundred percent in one leap, because the current amount of trade is so small as to be unspeakable.</p>
<p>What Is the Value of the New Agreement After All?</p>
<p>In the first six months of 1919, the goods amounted to 177,000 yen, the European part was 26,000 yen, the White Russians purchased 49,000 yen from Asian Russia, and 50,000 yen from European Russia, totaling 203,000 yen in Japanese exports to Russia and 99,000 yen in imports. During the same period, Japanese exports to various countries were 1,454,000,000 yen and imports were 1,108,500,000 yen. In other words, Japanese trade with Russia accounted for only 0.002% of total exports and 0.00009% of total imports. Therefore, people all over the world should be able to ask Japanese propagandists what the value of the new treaty is after all.</p>
<h3>Woodhead on Thai-Vietnamese Dispute</h3>
<p>The famous commentator Woodhead published an article in the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury yesterday, commenting on Japan's mediation of the Eurasian war, briefly stating that Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yōsuke's note to the British Foreign Secretary has caused unease in Berlin. After learning of this, the German side instructed the German ambassador to Japan to notify Matsuoka Yōsuke that this matter has been regarded by the British side as propaganda for Germany's weakness. Matsuoka deeply knows that his proposed mediation suggestion has caused condemnation from the German side and ridicule from Britain and the United States, so he has no choice but to make another statement, cleverly defending himself. Among Matsuoka's remarks, there are several sentences stating that Japan's dispatch of troops to Vietnam last year may even be the reason for the anger of Britain and the United States, only to claim that the purpose of the Japanese army's move was to obtain the "peaceful understanding" of the Vietnamese authorities. Little did they know that before obtaining the "peaceful understanding," the Japanese side had issued two final ultimatums, and after the "understanding" was obtained, they invaded Vietnam in the Lang Son area, attacking the troops stationed there. The reason for the "anger" of Britain and the United States is actually this and not that. In addition to mediating the European war, Japan is also participating in its so-called "mediation" of the Thai-Vietnamese war. Thailand is demanding land and engaging in aggression, all of which is instigated by Japan. Therefore, this "mediation" cannot be called impartial and selfless, which is really suspicious. And Japan's actions in the past few days have made it even more impossible for people to have no doubts. Japan's so-called "peace" proposal is for Vietnam to cede one-third of the Lao province and one-quarter of the Cambodian territory to Thailand. It is reported that this proposal has been rejected by the French side. At the same time, the Thai-Vietnamese peace conference held in Tokyo has also stalled due to the discovery of Japanese warships patrolling the Vietnamese coast. Japan's so-called "mediation" is aimed at exerting diplomatic and naval pressure on France to force it to cede land to Thailand. Japan's so-called "peace" proposal has become another "peaceful understanding," which is really unknowable. However, this kind of action is also inconsistent with what Matsuoka Yōsuke said, "Japan does not intend to take actions that make Britain and the United States feel uneasy about the Far East." If this kind of "mediation" can be called "mediation," then Matsuoka Yōsuke should not be surprised if the "anger" of Britain and the United States increases as a result.</p>
<h3>Men of Working Age Disappear in Hongkou, Absenteeism Increases Daily</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army forcibly dragged civilians in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas to serve as coolies, the entire city's residents have been terrified. Even the residents of that area have been staying at home, resulting in a sharp decline in the situation in more lively places such as Pingliang Road, Jingzhou Road, and Huade Road. Most shops and vendors are delaying opening and closing early, and even closing down automatically. Except for the elderly, the weak, women, children, Westerners, and Japanese, men of working age have almost disappeared on the streets. Japanese-owned public buses are suffering from extremely poor business. Most rickshaws only pull passengers to Zhabei and Fielun Road. Also, because workers from the electricity and telephone companies are also constantly being dragged away, the number of workers absent from work in various factories is increasing daily. The authorities of the two companies have already requested the concession authorities to negotiate with the Japanese side to stop the acts of forced labor, in order to maintain all public utilities. Also, some residents in the area who want to move south to avoid all obstacles have been refused permission to move, so the residents are complaining endlessly.</p>
<h3>Sudden Fire Accident at Jiangnan Shipyard</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi, formerly the Jiangnan Arsenal, after being occupied by the Japanese army, has canceled the part of the arsenal that manufactured guns and ammunition, and specializes in repairing warships and other shipbuilding matters. The shipyard's storage stack suddenly caught fire on the afternoon of the 23rd (the day before yesterday), and the details of the losses are unknown.</p>
<h3>Fangdan Case Resumes Hearing Today</h3>
<p>The case of four people suing the Shanghai Municipal Council for levying Fangdan land tax, the Consular Tribunal has scheduled to resume the seventh hearing at 2:30 PM today, still in the Council Chamber on the first floor of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Consular Tribunal Secretary Lang, Municipal Council Defense Lawyer Pollard, the four plaintiffs Ru Bao Yi, the original plaintiffs Fang Jia Ping, Hu Jing Fang, Zhu Pu Qing, Fang Wen De, and defense lawyers Liu Shi Fang and Wang Jian will all be present. After one more hearing, both sides will begin to argue.</p>
<h3>West Shanghai Gambling Den Rumored to Extend Closure Date, but No Knowledge on the Part of the Public Concession; Special Police Force Establishment Possibly Delayed Again</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that although the "authorities" have repeatedly assured the prohibition of gambling dens and dens of vice in the areas outside the West Shanghai Concession, news circulated among the Chinese this morning (24th) that the closing date of gambling dens, etc., has been extended to August, allowing those involved in gambling dens ample time to seek other employment. When reporters inquired about this with public concession police officials, they replied that they were unaware of any such change. The agreement signed on February 1st between the Municipal Council and the "City" remains unchanged. According to this agreement, the joint new police force to be established outside the concession roads will be responsible for closing all gambling dens and criminal activities. The new police force, originally expected to be established on January 1st, has been slightly delayed due to personnel selection and is expected to begin work in early March. It is believed that the establishment of the new police force will deliver a "fatal blow" to all illegal activities that have been operating in the badlands of the western district for the past three years. Previously, it was widely believed that the gambling dens in the western district would all move to the Nanshi (South City), but "City Police Chief" Lu Yingjin has now ordered a ban on gambling within the Chinese territory as well.</p>
<p>Several Issues Not Yet Agreed Upon</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, the "special police" for extraterritorial road construction may not be established on March 1st as originally planned. A spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department stated that it is highly likely that the establishment of the "special police" will be delayed, as "Special Police Director-General" Pan Zhijie and "Deputy Director" Klisha still have several issues that need to be discussed at length during their final negotiations and cannot be resolved hastily. He also stated that although there are rumors of establishment on March 1st, it has not yet been officially announced. Pan Zhijie and Klisha have been in discussions for ten days, discussing details such as uniforms and "branch office" locations. The spokesman continued that Pan Zhijie and Klisha's discussions are expected to conclude on March 1st. As for the issue of taxation for extraterritorial road construction, there are currently no new developments. Previous reports stated that the Chairman and Director-General of the Municipal Council had exchanged letters with Chen Gongbo, informally discussing the issue, but the two sides did not engage in concrete negotiations on the matter. The "special police" depend on this donation to maintain operations, therefore, negotiations on the micro-tax issue are a matter of utmost urgency.</p>

<h3>Brush Factory Workers Strike and Cause Disturbances; Authorities Dispatch Police to Suppress; Leather Goods and US Industries Labor Disputes Resolved Yesterday; Employees of Tailai Automobile Company Raise New Demands</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that brush factory workers in this city demanded increased wages, which was rejected by the employers. Today (24th), they went on strike. Some workers broke into two brush factories on Elm Road and Quenhai Road, causing disturbances and slight material damage. Also, last night (23rd), workers at a certain leather goods store demanded a threefold increase in wages without success and rushed into the employer's premises. At the same time, workers at another leather goods store on Tianjin Road also went on strike. Their leader was arrested yesterday, and the workers entered the store and carried out sabotage. It is reported that the leather store owner has increased wages by onefold, but the workers are still not satisfied.</p>
<p>Tailai Employees' Conditions</p>
<p>Furthermore, over one hundred employees of the Tailai Automobile Company presented several demands to the employer today, stating that the employer had not fulfilled the recently agreed-upon agreement and requiring a response by Thursday. It is reported that their demands are: (1) an increase of 24 yuan in living allowance; (2) a 15% increase in wages for those earning less than 80 yuan per month; (3) a 10% increase in wages for those earning more than 80 yuan per month; (4) the employer shall allocate an additional 5% of employees' wages to employees' savings funds. According to representatives of Tailai Company employees, after the recent labor unrest in the four major taxi companies, the telephone operators of Yun Feixiang, Niushan, and Yinse companies have all received salary increases, but Tailai Company has not. Furthermore, according to news this morning, the owners of various leather goods companies in this city have finally decided to increase workers' wages by seven to onefold. Approximately two thousand workers have decided to resume work tomorrow (25th).</p>
<p>US Industries Resumes Work Today</p>
<p>After all five hundred workers of the US-owned US Industries Company went on strike to demand improved treatment, the situation became deadlocked after persuasion from the Political Department proved ineffective.

<h3>Holding Firmly to the Outer Bastion of the Pacific: China Must Wage a Long-Term War (2)</h3>
<p>— Song Ziwen</p>
<p>Our country's supreme commander initially knew that the concentrated firepower of mechanized units operating on China's vast land would have its own difficulties. Conversely, if Japan had short and good transportation lines to transport its heavy artillery, tanks, and aircraft, it could defeat the Chinese army, which had light weapons and no air force assistance, on any battlefield. When the battle in East China was fierce, our senior military officers all knew that our front lines might be forced to bend, but we were determined not to allow them to be broken through. We knew that the deeper the enemy penetrated, the weaker its offensive would become. Our Chief of Staff called this strategy "trading space for time."</p>
<p>But if China cannot be unified, the courage of the soldiers will be useless. Although our country's rich areas have fallen one after another, the coast has been blockaded, and Japanese planes have continuously bombed, our people are still willing to continue fighting. This is the permanent foundation of our country's strength. When our main force retreated westward, we were still able to adopt an extraordinary strategy of leaving entire armies or divisions behind Japanese lines, supplying themselves locally, to threaten the Japanese army's flanks and rear. To use American topography as an analogy, if an enemy army landed on the Atlantic coast, attacked Pennsylvania, and advanced on Ohio, the United States would still leave a large army in Pennsylvania, uniting with the local people to form a center for guerrilla activities. And if the enemy army even reached Indiana, then American troops would still remain in Ohio and Pennsylvania to threaten the enemy's garrison forces and continuously sabotage their transportation lines; therefore, the deeper the enemy army penetrates, the more the transportation lines in dangerous areas increase, the more soldiers are needed to maintain the transportation lines, and the weaker the strength of its advance forces becomes as they move further west.</p>
<p>If we look at a map of China today, there are so-called occupied areas. These areas are occupied only on the surface, in fact, they only occupy the cities, and a few miles away from the cities, they are still within the scope of the Chinese government's authority, collecting taxes as usual, circulating national currency, maintaining law and order, and trying cases. The Japanese may be able to occupy railway lines and important highway lines, but next to them are "guards" of Chinese regular troops or guerrillas, who constantly blow up bridges, tear up tracks, and attack Japanese troops. Now the westernmost reach of the Japanese army is Yichang, while several armies near Shanghai, Beiping, and Nanjing are still full of Chinese regular troops.</p>
<p>The Japanese now also know that their occupation of Chinese land is very superficial and unstable, and they also know that their army is deeply trapped and unable to advance. Four weeks ago, on December 27th, Mr. Stiller of the Chicago Daily News cabled from Shanghai, saying that the head of the Japanese army's press team also admitted that the hope of China's collapse was very slim. The cable said: "The Japanese army admits that it is encountering difficulties, which is indeed noteworthy news. Colonel Mabuchi, who has been stationed in Ping for more than a year, has recently returned to Tokyo." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Lao Zha Patrolman Zhang Keqin Suddenly Attacked After Bathing; Two Thugs Break Into Bathhouse to Commit Crime; Bullet Penetrates Abdomen, Stray Bullet Grazes Back</h3>
<p>At around 6:20 PM last night, at Chunquan Bathhouse, No. 40, Tongchunfang, No. 63, Zhejiang Road, Beihai Road intersection, Zhang Keqin, a patrolman from the Lao Zha patrol station, 36 years old, from Tianjin, had just finished bathing in the large pool and was reclining on couch No. 23 in the lower-level Republic Hall. After a while, a group of thugs suddenly arrived, guarding the entrance. Two others, both wearing woolen overcoats, barged into the room, looked around, and spotted Zhang reclining on the couch. Without asking any questions, they pulled out box cannons and fired two shots. One bullet hit his abdomen, penetrating his back. The other missed, piercing the pillow and passing through the outer room's wooden wall. At that moment, a back-scrubber named Xu Ansheng (42 years old, from Yangzhou) was having dinner when he was struck in the right thigh by the stray bullet, causing profuse bleeding. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the two thugs fled with their weapons. Although wounded by the bullet, Zhang did not show weakness. He bravely jumped up, raised a square stool, and struck at the two thugs, but missed. They managed to break out and escape. Afterwards, the bathhouse authorities reported the incident to the Lao Zha patrol station. Police officers were dispatched in vehicles to the scene, recovered the bullet casings for inspection, and promptly summoned an ambulance to rush the two wounded men to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Doctors performed surgery and discovered that the large intestine had been severed. His injuries were serious, and he was unable to speak, leading to concerns about his life. It is reported that Zhang was attacked because of his usual diligence and decisiveness in handling cases, having solved many kidnapping cases, resulting in him being at odds with bandits, leading to this assassination.</p>
<h3>President of Jinan University Escapes Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Wu Xiu, Dean of Students at Jinan University on Kangding Road in western Shanghai, from Songjiang, over thirty years old, and formerly an executive committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, was walking along the intersection of Kangding Road and Xiaoshadu Road at around 4:10 PM yesterday when two kidnappers, accompanied by a Westerner, all unarmed, ambushed him. Seeing Wu walking nearby, they rushed forward, intending to force him into a car on the side of the road. The car's license plate number was 10350. Because Wu was quite strong, he saw that the thugs were unarmed and bravely resisted, eventually breaking free from their grasp and fleeing.</p>

<h3>Beheaded Indian Watchman Named Bajakasin Found on Route Sepanger, West Shanghai; Hospital Employee Suffered Multiple Axe Wounds, the Scene was Tragic</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that at 8:00 AM yesterday (23rd), several foreigners were riding horses on Route Sepanger in western Shanghai when they discovered the body of a beheaded Indian by the side of the road. An axe was found in a shallow ditch by the side of the road about one hundred yards from the Shanghai Sanitarium at No. 150 Route Sepanger. The Indian,</p>
<p>Named Bajakasin,</p>
<p>Had been a watchman in the staff quarters of the Shanghai Sanitarium for many years. When the body was discovered, the face was covered with a turban to hide the gruesome wounds. The body was wearing a green guard uniform. After inspection, it was found that the chest and arms had been axed. The murderer apparently used a sharp axe to unexpectedly kill Bajakasin while he was walking to work. Shortly after 8:00 AM, the Public Concession</p>
<p>Police Received a Report</p>
<p>And dispatched police to the scene. With the permission of the "City Police," the body was taken to the Public Concession because Bajakasin was a British Indian. The body was taken to the police morgue for examination. The examination revealed that Bajakasin had been dead for several hours, probably murdered while going to work at the sanitarium at midnight. At the time, the body was lying stiffly by the side of the road, and the color of his gray-green uniform blended in with the ground, making it difficult to distinguish. The front button of his coat was fastened tightly to cover the wounds on his body, but</p>
<p>Fresh Blood Gurgled</p>
<p>Out, and the area around the body was like a pool of blood. Bajakasin was 55 years old. It is reported that he had no personal enemies. It is likely that the murderer was lying in wait by the side of the road when Bajakasin happened to pass by and was killed. Police have taken many photos at the scene, but after further investigation, there are few results because the traces left by the murderer were washed away by the rain that night. It is noted that in recent years, this is the third time that the body of a beheaded Indian has been found in the western district. In the previous two cases,</p>
<p>A Murder Case Was Discovered</p>
<p>With political overtones. However, it is widely believed that the murder of Bajakasin this time has no political connection. Also, the English-language "North China Daily News" reported that Coroner Haines of the British Consular Court examined Bajakasin's body at Hongen Hospital this morning (24th), and Mr. Taal of the Shanghai Sanitarium confirmed that the body was Bajakasin, the watchman. Ding Zhongying, from Menghe, Changzhou, 54 years old, resides at No. 4, Jincheng Villa, Lane 1537, Jing'an Temple Road, Public Concession. His clinic is located downstairs, and he has a branch clinic at No. 7 Zhongheli, Fuzhou Road. He sees patients at the branch clinic from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM every day. At 10:10 AM yesterday, Ding, as usual, left his residence for the branch clinic. After getting into his own No. 2136 Peer car in front of his residence, the driver Yu Erliang (30 years old, from Pudong) drove slowly out of the lane. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>Three Thugs Ambushed by the Side of the Road</p>
<p>Wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants, each carrying a pistol, rushed onto the car, threatening Yu to drive at full speed westwards. It was not until they reached Fahua near Daxi Road that they drove Yu out of the car. When the three bandits kidnapped Ding at the entrance of Jincheng Villa, Zhang Dongyou (47 years old), the guard of the lane, from Henan, happened to be at the entrance and was threatened by one of the bandits with a gun pressed against his chest, warning him not to make a sound. Afterwards, the bandit also</p>
<p>Jumped Into the Car</p>
<p>And left. Zhang witnessed everything and reported it to Ding's family afterwards. He also reported it to the patrol station. It is also learned that Ding has five sons. The eldest son, named Jihua, is 34 years old and is being treated at the office. The second son, Jimin, is 31 years old and serves at the clinic on Fourth Avenue. The remaining three sons, Jinan and others, either study inland or study abroad. At the time of the incident, one of Ding's maids was washing clothes on the drying platform and witnessed the old master</p>
<p>Being Taken Away by Bandits. She immediately reported the situation to her mistress and urgently telephoned the Jing'an Temple patrol station, which dispatched detectives to drive to the scene. However, the bandits' whereabouts had already been investigated. Not long after, the driver and assistant, Zhong Ruisheng, returned, and together with the lane guard, they were taken to the patrol station for questioning. As for Ding's car, it had not been found as of dusk at 6:00 PM. The patrol station is currently conducting a strict search.</p>

<h3>Food: Southern Seas Cannon Fire Silence for One Day, Rice Merchants Would rather Not Sell for One Day; Therefore, Yesterday Was Still a Situation of Holding Back, Brokers Unwilling to Take the Blame, Temporarily Suspending Listing</h3>
<p>Since foreign rice was controlled by the four major rice merchants, it has become a situation of having transactions without a market, which has led to a dark rise in rice prices and unease in the market. These people are greedy, with the idea that if the sound of cannon fire in the South Seas does not stop for one day, they would rather not sell for one day. They simply want to hope for the rumored price of one hundred and dozens of yuan per picul of foreign rice on the market. Now it only sells for eighty-seven or eighty-eight yuan. Without the aid of cannon fire, it is still far from its target. Therefore, no matter how many millions of bags are stored or how many tens of thousands of bags arrive daily, it is not enough to shake their determination. However, the public is worried about the skyrocketing rice prices, the difficulty of purchasing, the worry of empty stomachs, the danger of starvation, and the anxiety about seeking a life to come. The hardest thing in the world is to get its balance. The source of life for millions of people, rice, is all controlled by a few wealthy rice merchants and hoarders. It is too painful. The Shanghai Brokers Association, in view of the past year's blame and injustice, and in this harsh environment, fearing that unscrupulous elements would impersonate brokers and engage in illegal transactions, has advised all brokers to automatically suspend sales for three days to clarify the situation and allow all sectors to understand the position and personality of the brokers. Therefore, the city's business is even more under the control of rice moths who disregard the people's food, forming a semi-paralyzed state. Except for the direct transaction of No. 1 Siamese rice by their line customers at 85 yuan, there is no formal market price for current rice. Even the returning futures are held firmly by the holders who are hoarding, and the total transaction volume for the day is only two or three hundred tons. Even the direct allocation of current rice to customers by firms is no more than a thousand bags. Unlimited price, the sensitive party opened 88 yuan, foreign yuan 89 yuan to 86 or 7 yuan has continued to add two yuan. A small number of Siamese No. 1 and milled waxy rice are just symbolic. New futures transactions without ships are not settled, which is a pretext for holders to raise prices. In fact, the situation is gradually easing. The insurance company notified yesterday afternoon that the insurance premium for Chinese seaports to Manila, Singapore, and the South Seas has been reduced by 50%, and the water insurance has been reduced to 1%. However, these rice merchants and hoarders who only know how to profit themselves and disregard the overall situation will again use the war between Thailand and Vietnam to raise the rice price again. Their intentions are sinister, and their schadenfreude is ten times more vicious than openly robbing with weapons. The guild's joint meetings are nothing more than occupying a few lines of newspaper news. How can they benefit the people's food? Just look at the current rice market to know that they are just perfunctory. As for the investigation of hoarders' rice reserves, it is also just a perfunctory matter. Once the heat passes, they will ignore it again. The rice market is so bad, it is precisely for the millions of Chinese people who eat rice that there is no way. The futures new transaction yesterday was not settled, and the return opened at 92 yuan for a small two-three month short squeeze, 91 and a half yuan for February, and 69 to 68.6 yuan for mixed broken rice, which are similar to the previous market. However, the owners only hope to profit and are still unwilling to sell.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is abundant, and it continues to arrive at the port day by day, as has been reported in this newspaper. The Zhagen Di ship of the Zhawa Company, which arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong last Saturday, also had more than 7,000 bags of foreign rice transported from Hong Kong, which were unloaded at the Blue Chimney Wharf in Pudong. The Taikoo Company's Anshun ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (Sunday), carrying 3,100 bags from Hong Kong. The Suiyang ship arrived in Shanghai on the same day, also carrying 5,761 bags from Hong Kong. There were also 1,341 bags of corn (Zub).</p>
<p>National rice such as thick and thin japonica rice is arriving in increasing quantities, but the sales are also ordinary because the prices have repeatedly risen to extremely expensive levels. Therefore, the market yesterday presented a situation of neither glory nor disgrace. The opening price of Kunshan raw white japonica rice was still 110 yuan, with the price of Hu-jian at 105-6 yuan and a special price of 107 yuan. Qingjiao thin rice was priced at 102 yuan and 101.5 yuan for Hu-jian.</p>
<p>The market for glutinous rice is scarce, and the four major households are not restricted, so they have all started to absorb it, causing the price to continue to rise by more than two yuan. The opening price of Hong Kong special yuan was 88 yuan, and the medium yuan was 86 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Weak Then Stable—One Ship of Fixed Wheat is About to Arrive—</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's flour market was weak then stable. The opening in the morning was due to the gradual arrival of flour transferred from Hong Kong, and it is expected that foreign flour wheat en route can arrive in Shanghai on schedule at the end of the month. People's hearts have tended to be soft. The initial opening of Zhonglou brand Australian flour was 25.5 jiao, and the initial opening of Meili brand was 25.7 to 7.5 jiao, which were all slightly less than the previous weekend. However, the situation in the afternoon was slightly tight, because rice prices advanced, and Chinese factories selling flat-priced flour have not resumed supply. Actual sales on this street are quite good. The price of Huabird flour was firmly at 25.5 to 7.5 jiao. The transaction volume was more than 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market was firm and quiet as usual. The source in inland areas is still sparse, and a factory-fixed ship of foreign wheat has received a telegram en route, and it has been safely loaded. It can generally arrive at the port at the end of the month. Chinese factories are waiting for foreign wheat to be supplied, and they are not greedy for Dumai intake. Japanese factories attach importance to eating, and they are unwilling to let go of the price limit. Therefore, the fighting market is also without goods to collect. The market is unusually quiet.</p>
<h3>Financial and Gold Market Stimulation and Recovery: Fierce Surge Leads to 6,200 Yuan Mark; Spot Prices Even Higher, Exceeding Futures by 500 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market experienced a fierce recovery after a period of sluggishness, surging directly to the 6,100 yuan and then the 6,200 yuan mark. It peaked at 6,240 yuan, marking the most vigorous rebound since the recent sharp decline. This was due to a certain bank's continuous absorption of a significant amount of spot gold in the market, coupled with the creation of momentum and the manipulation of sentiment. Uninformed individuals rushed to buy, pushing the price gradually from within 6,100 yuan to 6,140 yuan. Today, Tong Kang Yong Cheng Kee and silver houses were the most active in procuring gold, while Xin Yuan and others tended to sell. Retail investors also closed out their positions. The closing price was 6,225 yuan, 110 yuan higher than last Saturday's settlement price. For the switch from February to March, sellers offered 45 yuan, with limited transactions. Initially, hot gold was sold by熾人 to Xiang He for ten taels, at a price 470 yuan higher than the futures price. Heng Ji sold fifty taels to De Fu, 480 yuan higher. It also sold seven taels each to Xiang He and Dou Kang, 500 yuan higher. Fu Kang Yong offered ten taels to De Fu, 510 yuan higher. In the afternoon, Yong Cheng offered fifty taels to Xiang and Yong, still 510 yuan higher, peaking at 900 yuan, but there were no buyers. Jewelry gold rose by 20 yuan, reaching 690 yuan. Customs gold and other types remained stable.</p>
<h3>Full-Day Increase of 210 Yuan</h3>
<p>The market opened with a wait-and-see attitude. A lack of buying interest led to an initial drop of 25 yuan, to 6,080 yuan. It briefly rose to 6,100 yuan, but Xin Yuan and others aggressively sold, causing it to decline again, eventually bottoming out at 6,070 yuan. Thanks to the joint purchases by Da Feng Yong, Tong Kang Yong, and bill merchants, the trend turned upward, pulling the price beyond the 6,100 yuan mark, peaking at 6,115 yuan. At this time, retail investors took advantage of the high price to sell, causing the price to weaken again, fluctuating back to within 6,100 yuan, and dropping to 6,088 yuan. By the afternoon close, the market stabilized slightly, ending at 6,095 yuan. The afternoon opening lacked momentum, starting at 6,085 yuan. Subsequently, reports of tightening foreign exchange rates led Gong Da, Tong Kang Yong Cheng Kee, and others to buy, pushing the price up to 6,195 yuan. Xin Feng Yong sold, halting the rise slightly, bringing it back to 6,165 yuan. Ultimately, the softening of foreign exchange rates and the buying frenzy initiated by silver houses such as Tian Yuan led to significant mutual purchases, pushing the price beyond the 6,200 yuan mark, reaching a peak of 6,240 yuan. The final closing price was 6,125 yuan, a net increase of 110 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing price. The full-day fluctuation was 140 yuan. The selling price of spot gold from cash houses was 500 yuan higher than the current month's futures price. Spot gold was more than ten yuan higher, and the closing price was twenty yuan lower. The current standard gold price was fifty to sixty yuan lower than the listed price, with few opening transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold at 690 Yuan</p>
<p>The asking price for silver jewelry gold was listed at 680 yuan per tael at 2:25 PM. It rose another ten yuan when quoted, ultimately reaching 690 yuan at Da Tong Hang. Xin Tong Hang's price was similar to the previous price, with a buy-back price of thirty yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Fluctuates: Easing Followed by Tightening</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the exchange rates listed by foreign exchange dealers. The black market for British and American currencies initially eased but ultimately tightened. First, rumors of a pull-back by a Japanese trading house, followed by speculative buying by Hong Kong telegraphic transfer merchants, led to a gradual softening. The transaction price for U.S. dollars for the current month fell from 5.65625 yuan to 5.59375 yuan. By the evening close, spot U.S. dollars had reached 5.5625 yuan, a decrease of 0.09375 yuan compared to last Saturday's closing price. The British pound's trend was slightly slower, with the spot closing price at 3 shillings and 4.4375 pence, a tightening of 0.015625.</p>
<p>Japanese Trading House Pulls Back</p>
<p>The morning started with stable exchange rates for British pounds, U.S. dollars, and Shanghai currency. There was no market for U.S. dollars against British pounds or Shanghai currency. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The opening selling price for spot currencies by banks was 3 shillings and 4.453125 pence for British pounds and 5.65625 yuan for U.S. dollars, the same as last weekend's closing prices. Futures were also stable. After the opening, foreign banks sold U.S. dollars, while British banks were still willing to buy, albeit slightly. The transaction price for spot U.S. dollars was 5.6875 yuan. At 9:30, the foreign exchange market's listed rates were unchanged. The silver equalization tax also remained unchanged. Speculators still had the intention to sell, offering March U.S. dollar contracts to brokers for 5.65625 yuan. By noon, trading became clearer, with the closing prices for spot U.S. dollars at 5.65625 yuan and British pounds at 3 shillings and 4.453125 pence.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Also Absorbs</p>
<p>The afternoon market initially remained firm, as speculators continued to sell U.S. dollars. The buying price for March U.S. dollars by a certain American bank was 5.65625 yuan. Subsequently, rumors circulated widely, with a Japanese trading house pulling back, selling current-month U.S. dollars to a foreign bank at 5.625 yuan. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers also bought, pushing the current-month U.S. dollar rate from 5.65 yuan to 5.59375 yuan. The evening was particularly brisk, with the final rates for spot and current-month U.S. dollars at 5.5625 yuan and British pounds at 3 shillings and 4.4375 pence. The next-month U.S. dollar rate was 5.5325 yuan, and the British pound rate was 3 shillings and 4.428125 pence. Compared to last Saturday's closing price, the British pound's futures and spot rates were slightly tighter by 0.015625, while the Shanghai currency rate was down by 0.09375.</p>
<p>Hong Kong U.S. Dollar Fluctuations</p>

<h3>Securities and Domestic Debt Covering Short Positions — British and American Trading Houses Announce Dividends Together —</h3>
<p>The black market for public bonds saw a slight recovery yesterday due to the covering of short positions. The market situation appeared firm. Due to numerous rumors in the environment, some were at a loss as to what to do. Market trading was still relatively active. Xin Fu came to buy again in the morning. Shun Chang favored only Ding-type bonds. Lian Yi, Run He, Yi Zhong, and No. 38 all saw purchases. Lian He, Xin Chang, Zeng Fu, Da Tong, and Yi Tai all sold. The noon close saw a recovery of 4.5 jiao to 9 jiao. In the afternoon, Xie Xing Yuan also had a willingness to buy. Xin Fu continued to buy. Lian He and De Long both covered short positions. Sellers were more active. Da Tong, Xie Kang, and Yong Kang initially sold and then bought. Hu He Kee, Yong Chang, Yi Chang, and No. 35 all sold. Market sentiment failed to rally. Ding and Wu types turned slightly weaker again. Selling was more prevalent after the close, down a small number of jiao. The final market prices saw a uniform recovery of 4.5 jiao to 9 jiao, with Ding-type and 96-type being slightly smaller by 5 fen. The total transaction volume was approximately 2.45 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading saw 70 shares of Zhonghua Book Company change hands at a price of 44 yuan.</p>
<p>American China Securities Co., Ltd. has set February 10th as the date for distributing the 1940 tax-saving surplus special dividend and ordinary dividend, totaling 6% annual interest.</p>
<p>British Steel Co., Ltd. has chosen March 24th as the date for convening the fifth annual shareholders' meeting. It is proposed to distribute a final dividend of 5 yuan per share of national currency for 1940.</p>
<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Yarn Sales Without Major Development; Market Lingers; Coarse Velvet Cotton More Active</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak, and the overall situation remains one of fluctuation. The dull environment has scattered the intentions of bulls. Although there are still sporadic purchases that can be sustained, the difficulties in shipping make it difficult to develop and remain lacking in hope. Therefore, the market is hesitant to move forward. The highest price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,280 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,262 yuan. The afternoon price was 1,275 yuan. Subsequently, the rise in gold prices made sentiment more enthusiastic, rising to 1,308 yuan. The final price was 1,304 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening for Double Horse yarn was mediocre. The fluctuating situation in the Far East made people feel distracted. The opening price was 1,280 yuan. After this price was set, there were fewer buyers and more sellers. The market situation slowly declined to 1,165 yuan. Then, reports of calm foreign exchange rates and falling gold prices softened sentiment. However, with some covering of short positions, it rose again to 1,172 yuan. Due to the sluggish trading of spot yarn, it continued to loosen to 1,261 yuan. However, most bulls remained on the sidelines. At the close, it recovered to 1,272 yuan. According to statistics, the transaction volume for half a day was 5,545 bales. On the 25th, 130 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Siam, and 210 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by each group are listed below:</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation is firmer, but the actual demand is still mediocre. However, coarse velvet cotton is more active. With the change in foreign exchange rates, people's minds have taken a step forward.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was closed on Saturday due to an American holiday.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and the hanging of short positions. It then became firmer due to questions about the price of pure gold. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose by 2.5 rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade market situation is still tight. Sporadic transactions barely keep the market open. Although various parties' purchasing intentions are still not active, the raw cotton price is firm, and the recent import of foreign cotton is not crowded. The cotton market may have development hopes in the short term.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Finished Fabrics Shipped Out — Market Prices Only Obtain Small Gains —</h3>
<p>The finished fabric market trend was stable yesterday. Street dyeing factories continue to absorb low-priced gray fabrics. Various fabric factories supply them in abundance. Yong An Factory opened sales of March Da Peng fine cloth at a price of 41 yuan per bolt, and ordinary 12-pound fine cloth at a price of 38 yuan to 39 yuan, opening 500 to 600 pieces in total. Sales showed a fluctuating state. White fine cloth twill fell by 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao in the morning but recovered to its original level in the afternoon. Coarse cloth of heavy weight was flat. 9-pound cloth rose by 2.5 jiao per bolt. Some bleached and dyed fabrics rose by 5 jiao per bolt. Approximately 800 pieces of various fabrics were traded on this street. Zhejiang and Fujian businessmen bought more than 200 pieces of colored fabrics and bleached fabrics. Guangdong and Hong Kong businessmen bought more than 300 pieces of colored fabrics, colored twill, and crepe de chine.</p>
<p>East Cloth Market: Yesterday, the market rose and turned upward, and sales continued to rise. White Dragon Head fine cloth showed a mediocre trend due to the weak intentions of speculators, rising by 2.5 jiao per bolt, with a closing price of 45 yuan and 2.5 jiao. Mid-range fine cloths such as Rainbow Ball Flying Fish have become on par with the Dragon Head due to the surge in actual demand, continuing to rise by 7.5 jiao per bolt. The asking prices in the later market were all at 45 yuan and 1.2 jiao. Colored serge also rose to 1 yuan and 2.5 fen due to tight fundamentals.</p>
<p>Shipments: 50 pieces of finished fabrics will be shipped to Tianjin today (25th), another 100 pieces will be shipped to Yantai, 740 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 85 pieces will be shipped to Siam.</p>
<h3>Single-Sided Flannel Sells Well</h3>
<p>Single-sided flannel is still popular at the moment. Most of it is cut and sold for Chinese robes and Western suits. Generally, brands are selling them in order to cater to customers' minds and easily sell the fabric. The best-selling products are Shanghai Textile's own factory goods, because their selling price is average and suits the tastes of buyers. Only Yong Xing and Hong Kang are specialized manufacturers in the Shanghai area. Yesterday, Yong Xing's No. 1 Yuan Cang camel single-sided flannel was sold in batches at 23 yuan per yard, and No. 2 was sold at 21 yuan. Hong Kang's was sold at 22 yuan. Those made in the United Kingdom were sold wholesale for 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculation and Manipulation of Oil Cakes; Soybean Oil Continues to Rise by 1.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market continued to rise. Since the start of localized meandering progress last week, the overall trend has remained optimistic. The reasons do not escape manipulation and control. The market wind only sees rising, unlike the sudden rise and fall of soybean cake. Yesterday, 100 barrels of Dalian oil were traded at a price of 120 yuan to 119.5 yuan, rising by 1.5 yuan, and 150 barrels were ordered for the upper part of March at the same price as the current oil market, and 50 barrels were ordered for the lower part of March at a price of 110 yuan and 5 jiao. 300 barrels were delivered for the upper part of April at a price of 121.5 yuan to 120 yuan and 7.5 jiao, returning to 121 yuan and 2.5 jiao. Peanut oil stabilized. 50 pieces of Guangzhou oil were traded at a price of 106.5 yuan, 30 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded at a price of 147 yuan, and 300 cans of smoked tea canned oil were traded at a price of 140 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, 3,200 cans of sesame oil arrived from Yantai yesterday, and 2,300 cans of rice arrived from Qingdao. In addition, there were 12,000 bags of corn, which were shipped to Weihaiwei today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Large Quantities of Dutch Sugar Arrive in Shanghai; Association's Charting Steps Loosen</h3>
<p>A large batch of Dutch sugar has arrived in Shanghai. The Zhizha Yun Jia and Zhigen Di No. 2 ships of the Java Mail Ship Company arrived in Shanghai on Saturday afternoon. 4,100 tons of sugar, or 41,000 bags, were shipped from Java. Also, the Taikoo Company's Anshun ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (23rd), carrying 110 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, and the Suiyang ship arrived at the port on the same day, also carrying 200 bags of sugar from Hong Kong. (祖)</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the increase in arrivals and the temporary lack of problems with the source, people's minds gradually softened and continued to decline. The association's chart, the current month's 24-type coarse white sugar, the outer warehouse initially at 80 yuan, then loosened to 79.8 jiao to 5 jiao, 1 yuan and 3 jiao smaller than the 22nd. The 10th day of March delivery was 80.8 jiao to 3 jiao, 5 jiao smaller. The 20th day of March delivery was 80.9 jiao to 6 jiao. Dutch red was 61.5 yuan to 61 yuan, 1 yuan smaller. Taikoo car white B mark West Warehouse was 80.5 yuan, later falling to 79.5 yuan, 1 yuan and 3 jiao smaller. East Warehouse was 79 yuan, DY mark West Warehouse was 78.5 yuan, and HX mark was 78 yuan, all 1 yuan smaller.</p>
<h3>Coal and Anthracite Coal Market Prices Rise Daily</h3>
<p>The anthracite coal business is still quiet, and the selling price is firm and continues to move forward. The stock is becoming increasingly short, and the water feet are rising, and the combined price is rising daily. Traders are searching for goods, and dealers are hoarding goods. The market is rising step by step. The opening price for direct sales between coal merchants was 212 yuan for the opening freight train block and ton, 160 yuan for coal dust, and 205 yuan for Borneo anthracite. The warehouse delivery and barge water addition are charged separately.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Peach Meat and Walnuts Are All Available for Sale</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 1,000 bags of first-class goods of Tianjin peach meat were opened, with a higher quality, at a price of 219. Also, 197 bags of Taizhou walnuts were opened at a price of 60 yuan, and the number was opened. However, there are still 500 outer bags, and the goods are inferior, but the rice is sold.</p>
<p>Agaric Sees Repeated New High Prices</p>
<p>Black fungus is in extremely short supply due to the lack of sources, so the spring market has repeatedly expanded without any signs of loosening. The recent increase is accelerating, and new high prices are repeatedly seen. It first opened at 725 yuan, and yesterday a small number jumped to 750 yuan.</p>
<h3>Economic Talks</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Clock Leakage (Continued)</p>
<p>Because it is a table clock, placed on a shelf, a naughty girl will grab at it, like Fang Guan in the 58th episode, who broke the clock.</p>
<p>"Xi Ren smiled and said, "I was humming a tune just now and didn't pay attention to how many times the clock struck." Qing Wen smiled and said, "This junk (referring to the clock) has to be repaired again." She picked up the clock and looked at it. She Yue smiled and said, "Speaking of naughtiness, Fang Guan should be spanked twice. Yesterday, she was playing with the 'jianzi' (pendulum) and broke it in half a day.""</p>
<p>The so-called 'jianzi' refers to the pendulum. At that time, although there were clocks, their timekeeping was not like the current method of stating a certain hour and minute, but still used the old method of stating a certain 'shi' (two-hour period), 'ke' (quarter of an hour), and 'fen' (minute). As in the 45th episode:</p>
<p>"Dai Yu said, "I want to rest. Please leave and come again tomorrow." Bao Yu heard this and turned to take out a gold watch the size of a walnut from his pocket and looked at it. The hands had already pointed to between Xu (7-9 pm) and Hai (9-11 pm)."</p>
<p>And as in the 19th episode:</p>
<p>"As Bao Yu and Xi Ren were talking, Qiu Wen walked in and said, "It's the third watch (around midnight), time to sleep. Just now, the Old Madam sent a mama to ask, and I answered that you had gone to sleep." Bao Yu ordered her to bring the watch to look at it, and sure enough, the needle had already pointed to Hai Zheng (10 pm)."</p>
<p>And as in the 63rd episode:</p>
<p>"The crowd asked what watch it was, and someone replied, "It's past the second watch (10-12 pm), the clock has struck past eleven." Mai Yu still didn't believe it and wanted to take the watch to look at it, and it was already Zi Chu Er Ke Shi Fen (11:30 pm)."</p>
<p>Some say that the numbers on the watch only go from one to twelve, but it has to record the time in 'ke' (quarters of an hour), which inevitably requires more conversion work when looking at the time. That is well said. But in the old days, although the clock parts were foreign goods, the face of the clock was made in China, and still listed the twelve 'shichen' (two-hour periods) of Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai on it, dividing it into twenty-four hours. When I was young, I still saw this kind of chain watch, so Bao Yu's watch could say Zi Chu Ke Shi Fen (11:30 pm) without thinking, how do you know that this watch did not also list the twelve 'shichen'!?</p>
<p>As for the shape of the chiming clock, as in the 92nd episode, the chiming clock that Feng Ziying was peddling to Jia Zheng was more than three feet tall, with a little boy inside holding a 'shichen' (two-hour period) sign, and whenever the time came, he would announce the time, and there were also some people inside playing 'shifan' (a type of music). Together with the 'Yinggong Chunxiao' (Spring Dawn in the Imperial Palace) screen, it was sold for five thousand taels of silver. Also, Wang Fengjie had a gold chiming clock, which she took to sell for five hundred and sixty taels of silver. This shows the value of clocks at that time.</p>

<h3>Hollywood Fox Basketball Team to Perform in Shanghai Tonight; China Star and Military Officers' Joint Team to Challenge; 8:30 PM at West China YMCA Gymnasium</h3>
<p>The basketball team from the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation of Hollywood, USA, was invited by the Philippine Athletic Association to perform. They are now returning to the United States from the Philippines and are scheduled to pass through Shanghai today on the President Coolidge ship. The West China YMCA Sports Department, considering this a rare opportunity, has specially invited them to disembark and hold an exhibition game tonight at the West China YMCA basketball gymnasium. A mixed team of China Star players and military officers from the McKinley (or, it could be a reference to McKinley YMCA) is being organized to compete against them. The team will return home on the same ship tomorrow. The competition will begin at 8:30 PM. The referees are Qu Honglu and Brato. The Shanghai All-Star team boasts strong players such as Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuesong, Bao Songyuan, Ren Xiangcheng, Henryk Szlavitz, Roche, Simpson, and Mann, gathering the elite of Shanghai basketball with exceptional strength. The lineup of the Hollywood All-Star team is unknown due to unclear telegrams, but it is reliably believed that their basketball skills are extremely high. Not only are the players tall and strong, but their tactics are also innovative. The purpose of the competition is to learn and emulate, providing a reference for the basketball community in Shanghai. A wonderful performance is expected. To increase interest, a preliminary game between the Cubs team and the McKinnons will be added before the main event. The referees are Liu Hesheng and Cheng Zhifang. Tickets are seven yuan upstairs and ten yuan downstairs. Sales are limited to 400 tickets upstairs and 150 tickets downstairs. If the ship schedule is delayed, the event will be postponed. The order of events is as follows:</p>

<h3>International Cup Football: Portugal vs. France Final; Donghua vs. Beixi Children's Team in Group A on Saturday Afternoon at Recreation Ground</h3>
<p>The International Cup Football Tournament has a total of seven countries participating this year. The Chinese team first drew 3-3 with Portugal in the semi-finals but was unfortunately eliminated in the replay with a score of 1-9. The final between the Portuguese team and the French team is scheduled for this Saturday (March 1st) at 2:30 PM at the Recreation Ground on Avenue Albert. Portugal has strong players such as Fa Fanhong, Kaositan, Victor, and Oliveira, making their strength exceptional. Although the French team also has veterans such as Colete and Baoxiu Te, they are slightly inferior to the Portuguese team. Therefore, it is likely that the Portuguese team will retain the championship of this cup. After the match, Mr. Shen Siliang, the president of St. John's University, will be invited to present the awards. As for the weekend league games, on Saturday, the reserve team of Donghua will meet St. Francis, and the Group C team of Hualian Association will face Qiutings, both at the Aurora University stadium. On Sunday, the Group A team of Donghua will meet Beixi Children's team at the Recreation Ground at 10:30 AM. In addition, the Group B team of Youyou will compete against Yousheng, and the Group C team of Yizhong Tobacco will compete against Osman at the Aurora University stadium.

<h3>Small Ripples</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>In this day when most people indiscriminately blame "science" for the evils of airplanes, bombs, and cannons, Professor Carlson's "Science is Not Guilty" theory is a cooling medicine that hits the mark.</p>
<p>The world is progressing, and will continue to progress, which is an irrefutable truth.</p>
<p>Human civilization is a torrent that is always rushing forward, and no reactionary force, no matter how large, can turn it backwards, because the trend of the main current of civilization is always forward.</p>
<p>Historically, there may be a period of time shrouded in darkness, but this is only a small ripple in the torrent and does not hinder the overall historical trend.</p>
<p>In this turbulent era, we should have this firm belief in progress.</p>
<p>Thoughts</p>
<h3>Science is Not Guilty</h3>
<p>— Xu Mo</p>
<p>The more advanced human civilization becomes, the more people criticize and curse science. Is science really guilty? Recently, Professor Carlson of the University of Chicago expressed his opinion in defense of science in a speech. He believes that science itself has no shortcomings and no malicious intent to harm mankind, but the world has misunderstood it and misused it, thus creating all kinds of evils. Therefore, this is entirely mankind's own fault. Modern people enjoy the benefits that science gives us, and all they see are some industrial and new inventions of applied science, but they know nothing about the essence of science. We cannot all apply the principles of science to daily life. Even the greatest figures of modern times often hold traditional ideas, and their ability to apply scientific thinking is actually not much more advanced than that of "Peking Man" millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Professor Carlson believes that the failure of science can be analyzed into three main reasons:</p>
<p>First, modern education focuses too much on rote memorization. From early childhood in the family to university graduation, children are almost always reading dead books; they cannot learn the spirit of exploring the truth and experiencing reality. "You can teach a parrot to speak Latin, but a parrot that can speak Latin is still just a parrot!" Carlson believes that the modern education system is really too bad.</p>
<p>Second, modern scientists are becoming more and more specialized, and the more specialized, the narrower they become. As a result, they almost always get stuck in a rut, but when they step outside their own circle, they are just as full of impetuous emotions and narrow-minded prejudices as ordinary people who do not know what science is. Scientists lacking good cultivation can easily become the culprits of mankind without realizing it.</p>
<p>Third, human nature inherently has a stubborn force that resists new ideas and new lifestyles. For thousands of years, religion has used all kinds of inducements or threats to get people to walk the path of goodness, and it is still not easy to make them obey. The young science of history is naturally even more difficult to achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Although the situation is like this, we don't need to be discouraged or pessimistic. Professor Carlson concluded:</p>
<p>"We must admit that mankind has always been gradually progressing for millions of years. Their understanding is becoming richer, fear and hatred are gradually being eliminated, and they are becoming better, more decent, and more respectful of justice and humanity than before. Gradually but inevitably, the scientific method will make our lives more rational and happier; pain and tears will leave this world. Perhaps at some time or in some place, violent acts and madly invasive wars will hinder the pursuit of scientific truth, thus causing it to sink and be forgotten, but I believe it will be rediscovered in a more advanced time, with more excellent human beings."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(4) Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>"...We knew long ago that this fellow named Ma was too poor, we told you not to bring him, but you didn't listen and brought him here. Look at him on stage for so long, has he ever received a single cheer?" A strange, shrill voice was shouting upstairs. As Yu Kun reached the mezzanine landing of the stairs, he knew it was Shen Mazi speaking.</p>
<p>"We originally wanted to send a telegram to Shanghai to bring Liu Yuhua here, but he was asking for too much money..." The voice was very low and vague, full of heavy phlegm, and one could tell it was Zhao Si, the head of the Begonia troupe.</p>
<p>"Can't Boss Wu take less money himself?" Shen Mazi said very impolitely.</p>
<p>Begonia's room, number six, was almost at the top of the landing, and Yu Kun, swaying on the stairs, pushed open the door and barged in.</p>
<p>"What's all the fuss about?" He deliberately half-opened his drunken eyes and asked, pretending to be puzzled.</p>
<p>Shen Mazi was in the midst of his anger when he suddenly saw this disheveled man, half-resembling a beggar, barge in and speak in such a presumptuous manner. He couldn't help but feel greatly displeased. Although he saw that his behavior was also that of an opera performer, he thought he was just an unimportant extra and glanced at him briefly without greeting him, and continued to speak to Begonia and Zhao Si.</p>
<p>"Speaking of Boss Wu, you're not being very friendly either!" Shen Mazi leaned half his butt on a square table, rolled up his sleeves, and tightened the fat on his face, looking like a debt collector. "Nine out of ten times, the shows we schedule are cancelled by you. You're more serious about what shows to sing and what shows not to sing than our mothers! How can we not lose money like this?"</p>
<p>Having performed opera for several years, Begonia had become much more timid. In the past, when he was in the opera school, he would still playfully throw tantrums, but now that he had his own troupe, he only had to bow and greet people, and he dared not offend anyone. At this moment, facing this reckless Shen Mazi, he naturally had no way to deal with him!</p>
<p>"Boss Shen, there's also a layer of difficulty here." Zhao Si, who was short and fat, was somewhat bolder. "Not to mention plays like 'Pan Si Dong', Boss Wu can't sing them no matter what; even other joke plays are because of a certain Master Yuan..." (Three Nine)</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>A Happy Life</h3>
<p>— Liang Ying</p>
<p>"Is it bitter?"</p>
<p>"No, this life is happy." My wife smiled firmly.</p>
<p>It has been three years since we drifted to this isolated island.</p>
<p>Fortunately, not long after arriving in Shanghai, I found a job in a cultural institution, and my wife also became a teacher in a primary school. So, we tried our best to forget our destroyed home in a distant place, and built our home again in a corner of the isolated island.</p>
<p>Prices are climbing every day, and the magic clutches of the economy are tightly gripping us; for three years, we have been fighting for a living with our meager salaries. However, our life is quite happy.</p>
<p>In the morning, my wife carries a water bucket to the community boiler. Breakfast is soaked rice with oiled peanuts, or pancake fritters and soy milk. After filling our stomachs, we leave home to work.</p>
<p>As a rule, my wife returns home half an hour earlier than I do. When I habitually step into the alley of our apartment, my cold heart warms up. I gently knock a few times on the glass window along the alley, and my wife jumps out to greet me like a little bird, showing a childlike smile, and taking the things from my hands. Then this small kitchen, which costs twenty yuan a month, becomes busy. My wife skillfully cooks and prepares meals, and I help my wife fetch water and add coal balls to the stove. An hour later, we have dinner together very comfortably and happily. In the evening, we go for a walk outside. In the dazzling night light, we plunge into the white-hot crowd, appreciating the night scenery of the city; after a while, we walk on several quiet street corners, and in the cool night breeze, there is my wife's silver bell-like laughter. Sometimes, under the dim light, I write a manuscript; when our eyes meet occasionally, we exchange a silent blessing. And every Wednesday, we go to attend a symposium at a friend's place.</p>
<p>Four years ago, which was the spring of the year we got married, we also had a very lively home; but this home was destroyed in the fire of war. Will we forget this blood lesson? Occasionally, when I talk with my wife about the situation in the previous year, I can't help but have a sense of emotion; however, we are not sad, and we don't even recall the beautiful dreams of the past. My wife often says: "If the war hadn't destroyed our home, we wouldn't have understood so many things. Like our motherland, the past three years have not been wasted. We have come into contact with people from all walks of life, tasted things we had never thought of before, and learned more life skills. Like our motherland, although the present is a little difficult, we are facing the light." And aren't we very happy now?</p>
<p>Sometimes, we really want to go to the interior, but we can't raise this travel expense. However, although Shanghai has become an isolated island, it is at least a part of our country, and many things remain for us to do on the isolated island. As long as we stick to our posts, work hard, and do not fail our country, and do not fail our conscience!</p>
<h3>Nourishment for the Soul</h3>
<p>— Shen Fu</p>
<p>In our life, there are always some successful things, and these successes are mostly obtained from the encouragement of others.</p>
<p>Encouragement is nourishment for the soul. If there is no encouragement, you can't expect a worker to have a good job. Without encouragement, no one will live with interest.</p>
<p>Keep it in mind: after you encourage someone, how happy you feel! So, don't miss the opportunity to give encouragement to others. —George Matthew Adams</p>

<h3>Chaplin and Wife Watch "The Great Dictator"</h3>
<p>— Qi Ping</p>
<p>For two years, this genius comedian has been focusing on making his new film, and now it is finished. When "The Great Dictator" had its premiere at the Astor Theater in New York, Chaplin arrived, and he was more eager to know the success of the film than any audience member!</p>
<p>Chaplin, with his dazzlingly high status and unique acting skills, is sure to stir up society with every work he releases. When his "Modern Times" premiered in New York, the police authorities were very busy. Broadway was packed, and vehicles and pedestrians were blocked. In Times Square, a large group of workers were emotionally tense and unruly. Hundreds of police officers went to stop them, which shows how enthusiastic the situation was in general.</p>
<p>The premiere night of "The Great Dictator" was no less grand than in the past. Chaplin and his beloved wife, Paulette Goddard, arrived gracefully, and many people even broke through the police line to catch a glimpse of their demeanor. "The Great Dictator" was shown simultaneously in the Astor and Cattol theaters. That night, going to see this film became a necessary part of the entertainment program for New York's highest social circles. Almost all the seats in the two theaters were occupied by lucky children and their fathers who worked on Wall Street, as well as noble ladies. It was truly a scene of towering crowns, swallowtails, and gorgeous costumes shining against each other. Chaplin and the actor who played another dictator, Jack Oakie, came to see the film. Charles Laughton and his wife, Elsa Lanchester, who were visiting New York, also participated. They were surrounded by photographers when they entered the theater.</p>
<p>The unanimous opinion given by film critics to "The Great Dictator" was "Rather than saying it is another success of Chaplin, it is more appropriate to say it is his greatest work." The New York Times praised it as "A realistic, beautiful and good work produced by a realistic great artist." They believed that Chaplin had already expressed his resentment against mass production and making workers slaves to machines in "Modern Times" four years ago. Now, in "The Great Dictator", he expresses his utmost ridicule and scorn for the dictatorship system, and shows unlimited sympathy for the people. The value of his work cannot be estimated simply by "providing people with laughter."</p>
<p>"The Great Dictator" is about to be released in London. It is rumored in New York that Chaplin will receive 70% of the box office revenue. In London, ticket prices will also be raised, just like when "Gone With the Wind" was released; but Chaplin denied this, stating that his income would not exceed 50%, so the price increase is also unfounded. He hopes that this film can extend its run in London and agrees that hundreds of theaters can show it simultaneously. He believes that this film contains profound meaning and is a very good propaganda item. The British audience can not only appreciate it, but also benefit from it.</p>
<p>The Confusing and Tumultuous Rumors of a Breakup</p>
<p>After the marriage of Paulette Goddard and Charlie Chaplin went from secret to public, there are now rumors of a rift between the two. The fact is that when the famous British writer H.G. Wells came to the United States in January, Chaplin held a banquet at his home to entertain him, and Paulette Goddard was also pouring wine on the side. But a few days after Wells left, Paulette moved to the seaside villa, while Chaplin moved to Florida. That's all there is to the rift. (Huang Xinde)</p>
<h3>Tan Jigu Society Opera School</h3>
<p>— Li Yunying</p>
<p>Before the war, the only opera school in China that used its name was Fu Liancheng Opera School. Unexpectedly, opera schools would develop so much after the incident. Shang Xiaoyun started a Rongchun Society. Li Wanchun then started a Mingchun Society. These two opera schools have already occupied a considerable position in Peiping. Then Tianjin had the birth of the Jigu Society. The co-founders of the school are four. Now there are only Gao Xingqiao (the owner of an amusement park) and a certain prince of the late Qing Dynasty left. In addition, Gao's eldest son, Bohai, an amateur, was hired to be in charge. However, plays such as "Yijiu Gai" (One Wine Beggar), "Bai Taiguan", and "Cui Meng" are also often staged, and the audience is actually quite good. This is really due to the teachers coming from Fu Liancheng. But sometimes they also stage Journey to the West-style seaside scenery plays, which is very disappointing. Speaking of this, we should review the teachers in their society. Now let me briefly describe them:</p>
<p>Shang Heyu was always suppressed under Xiaolou in the nineteenth level of hell, and never became very popular. In Peiping, he was just teaching and singing, so the Jigu Society hired him to Tianjin as a professor. There is also Li Jiri (who unfortunately passed away shortly after joining the society). The society only used them to attract audiences. Isn't it really all contracted by Lü Tingyu (Shang's second-in-command)? As for Cheng Yonglong and Li Lanting, who are the highest paid in the society, they only taught two episodes of the Twelve Iron Roosters and eight or nine episodes of Sanmen Street. Liu Xiyi has also taught in Fu Society for many years. He is a hero (that is, the backbone of the opera troupe). "Night Run" and "Shenzhou Lei" are still good; "Changbanpo" and "Shizipo" are not good. Although Han Fuxin's skills are good, his repertoire is not wide. He can only teach "Wu Wenhua", "Zhao Jialou", "Yanyanglou", etc. However, it is always slightly better than the broad but unrefined Lü Tingyu. Wang Yunqing (i.e., Wang Duofen), who teaches female roles, is not as skilled as Ru Xiang. Yan Xilin, who teaches male roles, is still good, but he has not been in the society for a long time, and his position is not high. The rest include Zhou Lianfang (teaching female roles), Zheng Shaoheng (teaching male roles), Tang Lianshi (teaching old female roles), Liu Zhenlin (teaching clown roles), and Ma Shaoshan (teaching young male roles), whose skills are mediocre and not worth mentioning. If the society does not hire famous teachers, it will be difficult to achieve results in the long run.</p>
<h3>Strike in Hollywood: Garbo is Old and Not Worth Much</h3>
<p>— Hu Fanfang</p>
<p>Miss Ann Sheridan at Warner Bros. has a weekly salary of $750 (of course, US dollars), but she thinks it is unsatisfactory and has recently refused to make films. It is heard that Miss Sheridan's request is $1,500 per week. Warner Bros. has already indicated that they will "grant her request," but during the "strike," a film starring Miss Sheridan could not be delayed for long and has been taken over by Rita Hayworth.</p>
<p>Alice Faye has also expressed a similar "strike." "Tin Pan Alley" was originally her film, but because she said she wouldn't do it, Betty Grable was temporarily invited. Who knew that Betty became popular after acting. Alice Faye, seeing that her position was unstable, hurriedly backed down, so she co-starred with Betty in "Hello, Frisco, Hello," but the two's hatred became deeper and deeper. They even didn't speak to each other when they met. Seeing this, Fox selected two new scripts and had the two star in them separately. Alice Faye's new films are Rcad To Rio The Great American Broadeast, but whose "trend" is sufficient can only be determined by the facts.</p>
<p>Although Greta Garbo has not yet become old and worthless, the "fee" for each of her films has been greatly reduced. MGM recently offered her $150,000 to make a new film. Garbo has already promised. If it were three years ago, it would not have been done for less than $300,000. It is heard that the male lead of the new film is William Powell, and the title of the film is undecided.</p>
<p>After Tyrone Power starred in "The Mark of Zorro," he was highly praised by the audience. Fox has invited him to star in the famous Spanish literary work "Blood and Sand." In the silent film era, this film was starred in by Valentino.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>On January 27th, Shanghai Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, through Mingyuan Radio Station (frequency 960), broadcast a special Shanghai opera program for the Six Great Tonics grand prize prediction, and in order to treat customers favorably, telephone purchases on that day, no matter how much, will have practical and valuable gifts, in order to show gratitude.</p>
<h3>News from Shadow City</h3>
<p>— Hui Lin</p>
<p>Hollywood film reporters held an informal actor election at the end of last year, and the results were as follows: James Cagney was chosen as the most talented male actor in Hollywood, and Bette Davis was chosen as the most talented and best-performing actress; in addition, Paul Muni and Katharine Hepburn were also highly praised. Katharine Hepburn has been away from the silver screen for a long time, and this is her comeback year.</p>
<p>One of the ten epic films set in Africa, "King Solomon's Mines," contains many African native dialects, one of which is called "Swahili," a language widely spoken in Africa. 20th Century Fox officials have claimed that, besides English and Chinese, Swahili is the next most prevalent language in the world.</p>
<p>John Barrymore is currently performing on stage in Chicago. It is said that he fainted due to excessive fatigue. His friends rushed him to the hospital, and after some procedures, he was immediately discharged. If John insists on performing on stage twice a day, his health will be even more affected. He recently divorced his wife, and now he is struggling with his performances, truly a case of misfortune never comes singly.</p>
<p>Recently, many Hollywood stars have been causing trouble while driving. For example, Errol Flynn and his wife, Lili Damita, were riding in a car when Errol lost control and crashed the front of the car into a brick wall. Doctors initially thought his injuries were severe, but later found only slight injuries to his face and arms. At the same time, not long ago, Lee J. Cobb also came out of the hospital, also due to a driving incident. However, these things are not surprising, because three years ago, Wallace Beery was injured while piloting an airplane.</p>

<h3>Game 261: Scolding the Locust by Pointing at the Mulberry Tree, Proposed by Zhu Zhaoming</h3>
<p>The method for the pawn of the 260th game is listed below (Red moves first to draw). If the black side does not respond correctly to this game, then Red is bound to win.</p>
<p>Rook 2 advances 5, Rook 8 retreats 6, Rook 1 moves horizontally to 2, Advisor 5 retreats 6, Rook 2 retreats 8,</p>
<p>Pawn 6 advances 1, Rook 2 moves horizontally to 4, Pawn 5 moves horizontally to 6, General 4 advances 1, Pawn 7 advances 1,</p>
<p>Minister 3 retreats 1, Advisor 6 advances 5, Minister 5 retreats 7, Elephant 1 retreats 5, Soldier 7 advances 1,</p>
<p>Advisor 5 retreats 4, Minister 7 advances 9, Advisor 4 advances 5, General 4 moves horizontally to 5, Advisor 5 retreats 4,</p>
<p>Soldier 7 advances 1, General 5 moves horizontally to 6, Soldier 7 moves horizontally to 6, General 6 advances 1, Soldier 6 advances 1,</p>
<p>Pawn 7 advances 1, Minister 1 advances 2, Elephant 5 advances 7, Soldier 6 moves horizontally to 5, Elephant 7 retreats 9,</p>
<p>Soldier 5 moves horizontally to 4, Elephant 9 advances 7, General 5 moves horizontally to 4, Advisor 4 advances 5, General 4 moves horizontally to 5,</p>
<p>Advisor 5 retreats 4 (Draw). According to this game, if at the 26th move, Pawn 7 advances 1 and instead the Advisor 4 advances 5, then the Red Soldier 6 moves horizontally to 5, the General 6 moves horizontally to 5 to remove the pawn, then the Soldier 6 advances 1 to capture the Elephant, and Red wins.</p>
<p>In Game 258, "The Horse Steps on the Replanted Seedlings," the move of Red 8-7 should be changed to the 7-6 path, and the method remains the same.</p>
<h3>Li Amao's Hygiene Mailbox</h3>
<p>(General Answer to Mr. Huanwen and Four Others Who Suffer from Stuttering) Self-correction or using a stuttering correction device is possible. It is best to consult a doctor for examination. If the cause is a short lingual frenulum, surgery is advisable. (General Answer to Mr. Sun and Mr. He, Who Dislike Their Tall Stature) The body can be stretched through exercise, but height cannot be altered. The human body is not wood and cannot be cut short or lengthened. In ancient times, King Wen was ten feet tall, and King Tang was nine feet tall, indicating that this is a sign of great nobility, so there is no need to worry. If you must seek treatment, you may wish to consult Dr. Pang Jingzhou, who may have a solution.</p>
