<h3>日本對美提出答覆　談判現臨絕續關頭</h3>
<p>來栖野村昨謁見美國務卿赫爾太平洋和戰視日今後行動爲斷</p>
<p>合衆社五日華盛頓電　日本於今晨十一時（上海時間午夜十二時）向國務院送達其對於羅斯福總統關於越南日軍之詢問之答覆、日大使野村與來栖將日本之答覆交與國務卿赫爾、赫爾拒絕向報界透露答覆之內容、並拒絕評論所傳日本之答覆係否認在南太平洋有侵略之意向、來栖語報界稱、渠相信關於越南日軍之數目係言過其甚、來栖宣稱、渠希望試探談話仍然繼續、渠稱、尙未從東京方面接獲日本對於赫爾最近闡明美國在談判中基本原則之正式答覆、消息靈通方面相信、日本之覆文宣示日本並無使用越南日軍以供侵略之意云、羅總統語各記者謂、渠擬於今日下午晤赫爾、總統對日本局勢拒不評論、惟透露今晨會與赫爾會談、</p>
<p>路透社五日華盛頓電　據消息靈通之觀察家宣稱、除非日代表在今晨會議中所給予美國務卿赫爾之答覆、與東京方面傳來之各報好戰言論大相逕庭、則此項晤談似將甚為短促、美日談話即將停止、日方不利之答覆將不能使華盛頓引為驚異、因官方及非官方人士似皆預料將接到不能接受之答覆也、據非官方人士宜稱、日本無疑拒絕赫爾上星期三之文件、其對於羅期福總統所發越南問題之答覆、亦將使羅總統不能接受、誠如某無綫電評論家昨晚所稱、如日方答覆、謂巳停止調軍前往越南將不可信、如謂調軍之舉係因英方在新加坡增兵不得已而為之、亦將不能認為正當理由、如謂日軍係需耍作警備之用、則已早經駁斥矣、是以太平洋之危險的緊張、特依然存在、倘使日本之答覆果如所料、則太平洋中是否將有戰事之問題、似將繫於日本今後之行動矣、</p>
<p>合衆社五日華盛頓電　遠實危機或將於本日達最高峯、因日本將於今日答覆羅斯福總統對於日軍在越南之行動之詢問也、消息靈通方面預期日本將否認有使用軍隊以供侵略之任何童向、此項否認之答覆如果提出、將不能使美國政府滿意、蓋羅斯福總統係要求日本直截答覆何故派遺許多軍隊至越南也、總統稱、渠之問題甚簡單、此即表示僅聲明日軍並不為某行動之開接答覆為不滿意、日使館發言人稱、本日向赫爾國務卿提出日本之答覆時、或將對於赫爾國務卿於十一月廿六日交與來栖及野村之美國基本原則說帖、作一般政策之聲明如此項聲明係於日本半官新聞社同盟社所宜布者相同、則和平談判將告崩潰、其結果即為英美在太平洋實施其業巳準備之海軍封鎖之信號、且最近遠東方面常有非官消息、謂美國船隻已由海軍護航、觀察家稱、如日美局勢繼續惡化、則太平洋上更將推廣護航、日本今日即使提出保證、似亦不能使美國認為滿意、除非與保證同時提出善意之實在表現如撤退越南日軍等、</p>
<p>華盛頓之一般意見、以為東京雖不願接受美國之條件、惟日本軍隊倘不作侵略之新行動、則戰事尙可辟免、當日本正式拒絕美國之條件、尙有以外交技術稽遲火併之其他可能、例如東京願意時、與英或其他國家之商討是也、日本最後避免衝突之手段、可以採取「觀望」之政策、權威界稱以渠等之意見、最大之危險為過激之陸軍領袖將超越東京政府所還用之審愼而對泰或滇緬路之出擊、因而迭成衝突、</p>
<p>近衛原則舊事重提日稱仍謀對美諒解</p>
<p>路透社九日東京電情報局發言人今日招待外籍訪員時聲稱、日美仍將以誠摯之精神繼續談判、以圖商得共同方案、保持太平洋之和平、今苟非在抱誠摯之精神、則無庸延長外交談話、繼述及本月三日赫爾對新聞記者所發之言論、謂報載消息如果確實、日當局深以美國對於日本遠東政策存在顯然大誤會為異、總之開始談判之原因、即為有此誤會之存在、日本於對華戰爭中之基本政策、巳由政府慶次宜布、近衛任首相時所布之基本政策亦為其一、日本之政策非根據於土地野心、亦非賠款要求、惟圖中日之和平經濟合作耳、目下中國之大局、因戰事之賡續已見反當、惟余信日本之基本政策已為諸君所熟知、今誤會之事件皆為涉及中國越南者、其實日軍開往越南乃遵照國際協定行事、歷史上頗多前例、訪員問以日援軍聞往越南之總數、發言人拒絕宣露、僅謂其數未踰協定所規定之限額、此維希政府巳微實之矣、又問辦爾於本月三日接見新聞記耆時、曾稱談判毫無進步、此言實否、發言人答稱、此實不足介意、惟雙方今確尙有許多意見不同之點、當知雙方旣已釋明各點、談判可謂已有進步矣、羅斯福總統之問話行將答覆、惟十一月二十六日赫爾之備忘錄迄今尙未作覆、余意此亦將有覆、至何時出此、非余所能言也、有同日本報紙所　美國現圖延長談話以博取時間之說、渠是否贊同、發言人答日、余意美政府未必故竟出此、况雙方今仍以誠意繼續談話、以圖覓得共同方案、設一方無誠意、則亦無庸繼續會談矣、訪員謂渠注意外相東鄉最近所發日美談話之結果不日殆可明瞭之言論、發言人答稱、在如目前種類之外交勾當中「不日」一辭殊難加以定義也、</p>
<p>白宮舉行重要會議全面檢討遠東時局</p>
<p>合衆社五日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統昨日與衆院民主黨領袖麥克考馬克·副總統華萊士·衆院議長雷本·衆院外委會主席勃魯姆·參院民主黨領袖希爾·參院外委會主席康納萊代表即參院財委會主席喬治等會談、事後據告記者謂、「此次會議對於遠東問題之各方面、尤其是關於保護美國領土及美國生存攸關的利益各問題、會加以全面的研究」、</p>
<p>納粹施展外交手腕華府予以密切注視</p>
<p>合衆社五日華盛頓電羅斯福總統昨日與國會領袖會議時、相信嘗述菲律賓現受日本軍事集中所包圍之戰略地位、某國會領袖於步出白宮時稱、「局勢似頗嚴重」嗣後羅斯福總統叉與海長諾克期會談、或係討論太平洋之海軍戰略、華盛頓之若干方面人士以為上海之德國外交官之活動、圖謀影響東京之覆文、特別因美國之條件包括要求日本退出軸心故也、渠復以為納粹之策略、或係由章特曼大尉及其僚屬在上海會議中所擬就、共目的在於加强日本之態度、以繼續在太平洋之神經戰、此舉將迫令英美兩國之强大艦隊無暇分身赴大西洋之戰也、白宮會議以後、目前國防費法案中之菲島防禦將不受反對、獲得通過已無可疑、國防補充費八·二四三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元中、包括維持最近勸員之十六萬員菲律賓軍隊之款項、紐約共和黨代表泰巴氏在衆院稱、「倘日本之動向迫令吾人保衛夏威夷之西岸及非島、余將不感驚奇」云、</p>
<p>英海相對日再警吿憬然醒悟此其時矣</p>
<p>路透社五日勃萊斯托爾電　海相亞歷山大今日曾警告日本勿續作侵略、謂　希望日本國內之賢明勸告、當能阻止一般似將引導其人民於新侵略戰事者、目前此項威脅尙未過去、侵略或在旦夕云、</p>
<p>合衆社五日華盛頓電　國會議員梅氏本日宣稱、如渠爲國務卿、則「日本將接受吾人之條件、或隨於條件之後者、問以所謂隨於條件之後者、是否即係宜戰、梅氏答稱然、除非吾人並不經宣戰、而逕以吾人之海軍駛往轟擊東京」、</p>
<p>合衆社五日紐約電　昨日紐約各報之社評、對美日能維持太平洋和平之可能性更表悲觀、名記者李普海曼在「先驅論壇報」著文稱、「吾國首次瀕於眞正之全而戰爭」、渠稱於過去二年中、羅斯福總統巳發覺太平洋局勢之危險、並已盡其最大能力以避免戰事、但目前之努力顯已決敗、「紐約時報」之社評稱、「於四年之消耗作職後、日本之經濟壓迫日臻嚴重、而軍事領袖仍欲選取其再作侵略之途徑、業已鑄成大錯、至明年三月為止、日本費用共達六百五十萬萬、與去年收入比較祗有三百萬萬相去過遠、致引起目前通貨膨脹、及人民之生活程度日益提高、</p>
<p>美日見解南轅北轍殆已注定談判命運</p>
<p>合衆社五日重慶電　重慶官方本日宜稱、圍務卿赫爾最近對太平洋局勢之聲明、可使彼一方面希望華盛頓談判仍得繼續、一方而增兵越南之日人淸醒矣、赫爾攻擊日本在佔領區中之軍事專制、並謂華盛頓談話從來達到實在談判之階段、赫爾　明顯宣示日美國策之參商、如日本不變更其計劃、則甚至繼續談判之根據亦無之、但日本似不致變其擴伸之政策云、重慶官員並稱、日本之企圖獲得喘息時期、必不能如願、</p>
<p>路透社五日重慶電　華方官塲人士歡迎美國務卿赫爾星期三日對新聞記者而發之言論、今晨各報皆以大標題揭載之、半官方面稱、日本之拖延策略、殆已注定美日談判之命運、</p>
<h3>日半官通訊社宣稱美方條件斷難接受　東報對美仍恣意施抨擊</h3>
<p>合衆社五日東京電半官方之同盟社通訊社今日直斥美國對日之態度、並謂日本不能接受美國之「和平建議」、同盟社轉戰外交觀察家才意見、認為日本萬難接受美國之要求、為求取得合理解決、此項要求此後決不能被採用為談判之基本條件、（按美國之要求包括日軍撤出中國及越南、及遠東貿易權益均等）、同盟社及當地日文報紙繼續猛烈攻擊美國、尤集中於國務卿赫爾致日本之公文、赫爾曾痛斥日本在亞洲佔領區內樹立軍事暴力政權、文謂日本仰籍武力征服及饜迫被征服之民族、同盟社稱、赫爾將談判詳情出以如是之宣佈、使局勢益形嚴重、又言、自美國對日本致送最低要求後、談判即未有進展、赫爾之文吿、足以表示美國缺乏談判誠意、美國仍計劃以陳舊之原則以拘束日本、此項原則、即在前此之遠東局勢中亦已久不適用」、「讀賣新聞」指斥美國「侮辱日本」、並稱、「日美之見解適得共反、足以表示毫無妥協之希望」、國家主義極端派之「報知新聞」指責美國忽視「東亞之新局勢」、其言云、「日本一旦被迫起而突破反日包圍以獲取一己之生存及權力則責任應由美國負之」、「朝日新聞」稱、赫爾氏作此項要求、無異對日「破壞信義」、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>應共謀平準物價之實現</h3>
<p>兩租界當局管制物價，已收絕大之成效。卽如目前國際時局之轉變，美軍及英美僑民先後撤退，荷英輪船之駛回南洋，而上海市塲仍得安諸如常，不露倉皇驚遽之色，絕鮮操縱投機之有，設無管制於前，米價恐已　騰至二百數十元，一切日用必需品，曲踴距躍，又不知至如何地步。得使囤虎與市蠢匿跡，物價與民生遂甯，幸賴有此一舉耳！</p>
<p>雖然，大衆猶覺有所欿然者，良為所限制之物價，類皆為進口貨，而進口貨之中，就一般購買經騐所及，往往有行無市，有價無貨。有謂欲得限價之貨，應向大商店去購買，而大商店之回絕則一，昔出高貴之代價，尙是求之可得，今則所出之代價，未必有减於已往，然以販賣商失所操縱之故，反是欲購不能。此其弊之所屆，將為限價之暗中打破。勢須欲得其物，非但必需出高於限價之價格，亦且非與商店相熟悉，縱願出高價亦難必得。旣自願出於忍痛相求之一途，孰肯舉發之；又為違限之交易，焉肯出給發票，故從發票以根究遠限不易得，容或有之，亦必出於一時之怠忽，若慣於舞弊者，甯肯落憑證於人手，自貽伊戚。因之欲矯其弊，必須進一步與進口洋行取得聯絡，非徒控制其門售市價，亦且控制其門售店家，由進口洋行就其往來素悉信實可靠之商店，交其照所定價於門市發售，不再經代理商批發商之手，顧客可向此種經售之商店購致，庶可普及行銷，以應消費，並以杜有行無市有價無貨之從中作弄。再其次，由洋行直接銷售於消費者，此則惟恐各洋行無此人力，卽有此人力，亦怠於作為，而顧客仍感覺不便也。</p>
<p>至於公開定價物品，多為進口洋貨，有非為大多數華人所必需，僅為少數美人士所享用，此則主持此管制事宜者，大都為西人，西人自易興西人相接近。况感覺有管制物價之必要者，並非限於華人，蓋其所販運所享用之物品，一入市塲，同樣受操縱囤積之痛苦，故亦亟亟於謀取締。而又首先取得合作者，為進口之行家，既為進口貨，同樣公開定價，則又不問夙為華人所需，孰為西人獨享，而一一厘定公布之，是亦應有之義。惟是華人一般之呼聲，於米糧及日用必需品外，但求大餅油條豆腐靑菜蘿蔔之平價。麫受內地小麥統制之累，僅洋麥是賴，遂使本廠粉大都停業，卽有工作，出粉遠不足以應市求。市上所銷，全為洋粉；洋粉又烏能出於黑匯供求律支配之外。况有同是洋粉，尙以所儲地點不同，猶不能取得合作，而市價大有軒輊，管制之難可如。今聞麫粉已定為四十元一包，是否普應門銷，以饜居民之需，抑專供餅饅製麫各業之用，而不及居民；要知以麫食代餐者固亦不在少數。至一言油條豆腐之昂貴，不能不回想到油豆之來源，與小麥同其命運，蓋亦受所謂統制。統制云云，不但限制其出口，且亦加重費用，提高市價。嘗聞北貨業中人言，北貨之貴，大非昔比，花生仁一角數分一斤，今須售二元數角，柿餅最微末不足道，而今亦售一元六七角一斤。非為生仁柿餅產價之貴，而為就地所行使之紙幣，高抬其値，遠過於法幣，遂以換算之結果，北貨價格，高逾尋常。近則此種趨勢，大有擴張其聯繫之範圍，以求逞於一時，雖想望之能得實現與否，尙在時局之轉變如何：但未來物價之有無變化，要看法幣所遇之摩擦，强弱何如，惟法幣之終為法幣，仍無所用其懷疑。今觀於兩租界當局對於環境之應付，處處表示其和諧協調之作風，此以地方治安為重，安輯民生為目的，不問其他，用心良苦；而不知能否循此實現其願望，有以紓民生之困，今猶難言。卽如靑菜蘿蔔魚肉葷腥之物物皆貴，亦正為租界四週有所謂封鎖綫，及銷售有獨占市塲之故，致來源受種種牽掣。實則流入上海之物，今尙有何途可以輸出，而必欲重重封鎖統制，直無意義之可有。故欲安定上海之物價，必求所以為安定物價之障礙者，在協力解除之必要。舍此縱有平準之法，而以貨源被控制，征斂無饜足，仍未能收實際之功效。</p>
<p>抑猶有言者，洋商旣以平準當地物價為務，則辦法不容有例外，待遇豈可有厚薄。况同為上海之市民，其一切權利義務宜從同，在昔自視甚高之舊觀念，今亦應隨滌瑕蕩垢之新潮流以俱逝。比聞限價物品之供應分配，未得其平，人言固未可盡信，而無風豈能興浪。然顯著之事例，如出售火油，僅許十七家零售店照限定價格，出售限量之火油於華市民，而外僑欲購火油，卽可向領派油證，在就近之該公司服務站購得所需之火油。原該公司之用意，當無非為華人領得派油證，誠恐有以利用作囤積；實則華人之中，能有多少可作圃油之企圖，設無業中人為之策應，亦欲囤而無由。故以為如其不有派油證則已，有則不分華洋，凡在同一之條件下，宜得到同樣待遇，否則應同向零售店購得之，亦未始非公允之道。然此並非定須得有派油證之謂：但願油公司採取有效之處置，使全市民隨時隨地皆可照限定之價，向其鄰近之店，購限量之油，而不限定於此十七家特定之零售店也。</p>

<h3>夫婦間幸福的由來</h3>
<p>夫婦的所以結合，無非是為追求人生的幸福。一個獨居的男子或處女，難然生活的享用，可以使他們毫不費心；但在他們的內心中每感有寂寞似的缺陷。這種缺陷并不能以金錢或地位來彌它，必須要以心中的人兒——情人——才能予以滿足，世間有着很多害有相思病的男女，他們因此而致　　，消瘦，甚至衰老，但一到他們心中的人兒來到時，她或他的精神和肉體就頓時康復了。我們不要以遠的事實來醫喻，只要看一對因愛情結婚的男女，因為他們的宿願已償，身心上相互的快慰着，人生也發生了新的興趣。在學術興事業上也必然打起精神，同心合力，向前　進，這是多麼的幸福而有意義呀！</p>
<p>不過事實上也有許多結婚的男女，身心反　發了，愛情毫無，陷入人生疼苦的深淵中，這是什麼緣故呢？據醫學上的諭斷，大都因男子於早年犯有自凟遺精，或婚後的荒　縱瘡。把主宰性能健康的生　腺液（精液）耗消太多，於是新陳代謝作用減退，發育機能停滯，腦，脊髓，性三大神經陷於衰弱狀態，精關松弛，則凡滑精漏精，造濁陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等病即相繼而起。此種丈夫，在夫婦生活上，每表演着衰弱無能，或竟完全不能人道，這不特　性了妻子可貴的青春，同時自己的內心中亦是如何的悲疼呢？夫婦間的幸福，在他們　如輕煙似的幻夢，在幻夢之餘所殘留的不過是猙獰面目的惡魔！唯一補救辦法，據世界名醫的千萬病案，及余多年經駃，均以服生　腺素製劑「生　素」最為對証特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補賢，健腦活血，滋養神經，夏今服用，功效興冬天完全相同，繼續服用半月以後，更能助長發育，調整新陳代謝，上述各征必可根本痊愈。</p>
<p>患者趙興，江寗人，年三十一歲，患早！陽萎征甚劇，夜眠間有滑精，上月求治於余，余投以大量之「事實勝於雄辦」也。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>多情的女郎必然乳峯高聳</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>興人者會有一面之雅的美國著名生理學家　Samaher　聖曼爾博士會說：『多情的女郎必然乳峯高聳』，起始他這句話，是根據女性的乳峯發育，完全由於生　腺卵巢機能的强盛，因為生　腺卵巢機能是婦女全部腺器的總樞，它如果能够健全强盛，在體內就產生多量的內分泌，此種內分泌，能促進女性的特微發逹。是以體態方面：最　著名。便是乳峯高聳，乳頭呈紫橙色，獨如椎形山峯上的塔頂，此外，臀部亦必非常體　，身段娘娜，形成健美而多姿的曲線，多麼令人心醉！至於感情方面：亦因新陳代謝作用的旺盛之故，常　得活潑玲瓏，敏捷多情，此種女郎，因品性興體格的溫柔興健美。所以出外交際，便博得人的回聲贊美，舉為交際明星。而一旦出嫁以後，又是一位十足典型的賢妻良母，家庭間充滿着喜氣，丈夫尊之著天人，那眞是多麼榮耀而可喜。但過去如會犯自凟束胸，或月經不調，白帶緾綿，營養不良，重征侵害，致生殖腺卵巢機能失健，影響乳峯發育者。那不但多病多疼，健美喪失，而且還要被男子壓惡，甚至遺棄不顧呢！唯一補救方法，邸有服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最為對征而特效。蓋此劑係由雄狀動物的重生殖腺卵巢分泌製成。故服後一日夜間即能培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用。必可於短期內使乳峯高聳，臀部　　，面　紅潤，青春長駐。</p>
<h3>遺精　青年　快快走上自新之路</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念會</p>
<p>機能决不會等候我們，只有我們去等候機能，若機能錯過了，難用九牛二虎之力恐亦找不回來，那時的後悔是徒然的！幼而學，狀而行，在我們的各期生活中均有着特殊而重大的任務。所以凡青年人必須疼下功夫來尊定我們的學術和事業的基礎，就是盡我們畢生，的精力，努力以赴，尙恐不及，何况把大好的青年黃金時代再蹉跎了呢？可是青年人的覺悟者固然有，不覺悟者也正多着！即如在春情發動期的青年有自凟縱慾乾眞不知凡幾？要知自凟慾，最易推殘性神經使精關松弛，於是液是我們幸福的源泉，也是生命的要素，在生理學上言，精液就是生殖腺液，除貯存於精囊中者係專應愛情的需要，營生殖作用而外，其內分泌素能直接滲謚血液，灌溉全身，有調整新陳代謝，助長發育，滋養神經等功能。今若遺精日久而不治，則生殖腺液必告枯竭，則凡發育不全，早　陽萎，腦衰健忘，神經衰弱，怕寒　熟等征即相繼而來，此種青年，不特將為男女愛情中之罪人，影響於生育，幸福喪盡！同時也錯過了求學機會，念狀而已衰老，亦不過社會上—個頹廢的蟲蟲而已！</p>
<p>唯一補救辦法，即服「希米脫氏固精片」最為對征特效。因此劑據世界名醫及余多年經　之證明，服後晃能　固精關，鎭靜神經，於遺精有藥到病除之功。如因遺精有上述征象，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦　，增益精血，能繼續服用，必可於短期內恢復美滿。患者能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>廠屯午後同出擋　棉紗節節下跌不支</h3>
<p>紗熾市大疲、且午後跌風復　、此因現紗銷路社絕、廠方待款需用、向雙馬市塲套出、至於揑現貨商、亦抱同樣步驟、於是籌碼充斥、多頭雖勉為掙扎、然環境如此、勢難抵抗、所以盤旋多日之紗市、復告破裂、而重形下瀉矣，二十支雙馬高價為二千四百四十元、低價為二千二百八十元、</p>

<h3>談幾種長壽的動物</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>我首先要提出來討論的一個問題，就是關在動物園中的那些動物的囊命，能不能作為該種動物壽命的「絕對標準？莊子不說過麼：「馬，……齕草飲水，翹足而陸，此馬之眞性也。……及至伯樂曰：「我善治馬！」燒之，剔之，刻之，維之，……馬之死者十二三矣！……馳之，驟之，整之，齊之，前有橛飾之患，後有鞭策之戚，而馬之死者過半矣！」法國大自然科學家蒲豐也很明瞭這種道理，所以他在他那巨著自然歷史中，常常對於一種動物深致惋惜說：「牠要是被照管得好，能活的很久，雖說是在俘據狀態下；人該想牠要是在自由環　中，牠的生命當更為長久。」或是說：「這種動物因為遠離開本土，……不能發育到自然的長度」等等。眞的，我每一次去參觀法國公園中那一隻獅子和老虎，而見牠們老是無聊的臥在那幾尺見方的鐵範中睏覺，連眼也不肯睜一睜，便每一次替牠們感覺着委曲，氣悶：眞的，在這種環境下邊，你想牠們能活到那應咳活的年齡麼？聞言已多，請看幾個長壽的動物吧：</p>
<p>象　蒲　自己說：「有幾位著作家寫了象能活四五百年，旁的說三百年，最後有人說：一百五十年。我想折衷的數自是眞的，而且人己竟確知俘獲之象能活到一百二十或一百三十歲了，則那些自由的……至少應該活一百歲。」註釋這自然歷史的人，又摘取了多少旁人的記錄，而指市象能活到一百五十歲。</p>
<p>魚　有一個名叫　B．Jacob　的法國人，在所作魚什自己家一書中，記載了那發動第三次十字軍的著名德帝紅鬚斐特勒，對於魚類有特別的興趣：他尤其喜歡他所盡心養育的一種名叫　Brochet　的偉麗的魚。有一天他異想天開，想把刻了字的一種銅　裝飾在他的寵「魚」身上；這事也馬上實行了，時在公允一二三〇年。事過境遷，皇帝死去，頒恩魚類這種小小的舉動也早已被人淡忘了。可是到了公司一四九七年，就是說又待了整二百六十七年，有一位無名的德國漁父，竟在河中網得了一雙重有三百六十公斤的大　Brochet　魚，而且頂叫人驚異的，是皇帝頒賜給牠的那一枚銅環，還完璧無缺的帶着呢！</p>
<p>龜　中國人所說的「龜齡」是毫無根據的麼？請看大自然科學湯姆生在動物生活史－萬有本－中描述幾種大龜以後的諭斷吧：「大龜能生活到一百五十年以上，而我們談過的幾個竟有數百年的高齡。……在一七六六年，從塞舌爾羣島，運了五個大龜到毛里亞島，－二島皆在非洲東的印度洋。－其中有一個到本世紀初還活着！在一九〇一年，加多博士報告說：「他們難然差不多瞎了，卻仍守固常的習慣，平保持着健康。他的殺長到一碼以上，背上能載兩個人！」</p>

<h3>戰爭興結婚</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>前途的不安似乎並不能阻止年靑人的結婚。據可靠的統計，去年英國共有四六八，二六七對夫妻結婚，這數目差不多已接近五十萬了。一九三九年結婚之數巳不算少，可是去年却較之父增加　萬八千對。這似乎巳打破英國歷年來的紀錄，難然就目下的　加率看起來，今年的總數也許將遠超過去年之數。</p>
<p>這也許是戰時情形使然的。所有的女郎都對軍人表示無，限的傾慕。因此一個男人只要穿上制服，就引起愛神的箭向他的胸口射來了。並且還有一點是，戰時的結婚使人感到加倍興奮。</p>
<p>無論如何，不顧困難而不安的前途，年靑的男女都充滿結婚熱却是不可否認的事實。</p>
<p>根據英國的結婚登記，在戰前三年間結婚率是千分之一七·四。也就是說一千人中只有十七個半結婚。可是現在這千分率已增加為千分之二二一·六。今年的比例也許將超過千分之二三了。這應歸功於愛神呢？還是應歸功於希特勒？</p>
<p>在第一次大戰時結婚最繁盛的一年是一九一五年，在那時候局勢也極不安定，年靑的夫妻似乎也不至相信幸福的前途在等待着他們。</p>
<p>停戰協定成立的次年結婚之數又驟形增加－計三六九，四一一對－－同時也產生了大量離婚案件。這是匆促的結婚所引起的必然的結果。</p>
<p>上次戰後結婚之數遠不及去年之多。不知這次戰後將產生多少　男女的結婚呢？讓我們等待着吧。</p>

<p>兒童們在學校裹由國語·自然·常識·算術等等得到了初步的知識，也從音樂·體育·遊戲中表演兒童自己的力量和感情。我們從事於教育的人往往覺得，應該使用一種活動——將各項畢科聯繫地綜合攏來，給兒童以更集團的，活躍的社會化的演習，和教育印象最深刻而最易收效的，那就祇有「教育電影」和「兒童話劇」兩種方法了·但不幸得很，我們中國的電影，很少有一張是教育片·——這是因為製片商人不高興放本錢到這種片干上去。因此，我們得格外地努力於兒童的劇運！</p>
<p>兒童需要戲劇</p>
<p>雖　有多少小學裹都有兒童劇團的組織，但他們都祇有在開什麽懇親會的時候演一次鄘，這樣，話劇僅僅是教育上一種點綴品了。——注意！話劇決不是一種點綴品，消遺品！</p>
<p>眞的！小朋友們非但愛看戲，同時還喜歡做戲，——在新年裹，我們不是常看見孩子們面上套了一個黑瞼或是紅臉，手舞足蹈的做着戲嗎？嘴裹還哼着調兒呢！——他們如果找不到戲劇藝術這一種精神的　食，便會往各個遊藝塲所，街頭的江湖賣藝人這種地方去學習那些低級趣味的東西，或者是做速環圖　的良友「良友」。呀！那是醜惡的，有毒的！兒童們脆弱的心很容易會中了這種毒</p>

<h3>Japan Submits Reply to U.S., Negotiations at Critical Juncture</h3>
<p>Kurusu and Nomura Meet U.S. Secretary of State Hull Yesterday, Pacific War or Peace Depends on Japan's Future Actions</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, December 5th - Japan delivered its response to President Roosevelt's inquiry regarding Japanese troops in Vietnam to the State Department at 11:00 AM this morning (midnight Shanghai time). Japanese Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu handed Japan's response to Secretary of State Hull. Hull declined to reveal the contents of the response to the press and refused to comment on whether the Japanese response denied any intention of aggression in the South Pacific. Kurusu told the press that he believed the numbers regarding Japanese troops in Vietnam were exaggerated. Kurusu declared that he hoped exploratory talks would continue. He stated that he had not yet received a formal response from Tokyo regarding Hull's recent clarification of the fundamental principles of the U.S. in the negotiations. Well-informed sources believe that the Japanese reply declares that Japan has no intention of using Vietnamese troops for aggression. President Roosevelt told reporters that he planned to meet with Hull this afternoon. The President declined to comment on the situation in Japan but revealed that he would meet with Hull this morning.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, December 5th - According to well-informed observers, unless the reply given by the Japanese representatives to U.S. Secretary of State Hull in this morning's meeting is vastly different from the hawkish rhetoric transmitted from Tokyo by various newspapers, then this meeting is likely to be very brief, and the U.S.-Japan talks will cease. An unfavorable reply from the Japanese side would not surprise Washington, as both official and unofficial sources seem to expect an unacceptable reply. According to unofficial sources, Japan undoubtedly rejects Hull's document from last Wednesday, and its reply to President Roosevelt's Vietnam question will also be unacceptable to President Roosevelt. As a radio commentator said last night, if the Japanese reply states that the deployment of troops to Vietnam has stopped, it will be unbelievable. If it is said that the deployment was due to the British increasing troops in Singapore, that will also not be considered a legitimate reason. If it is said that the Japanese troops are needed for security purposes, then that has already been refuted. Therefore, the dangerous tension in the Pacific remains. If the Japanese reply is as expected, then the question of whether there will be war in the Pacific seems to hinge on Japan's future actions.</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, December 5th - The Far East crisis may reach its peak today, as Japan will today reply to President Roosevelt's inquiry regarding Japanese military actions in Vietnam. Well-informed sources expect that Japan will deny any intention of using its troops for aggression. If this denial is presented, it will not satisfy the U.S. government, as President Roosevelt is asking Japan for a direct answer as to why so many troops were dispatched to Vietnam. The President said that his question was very simple, which indicates dissatisfaction with a response that merely states that Japanese troops are not involved in a certain action. A spokesperson for the Japanese embassy said that when submitting Japan's reply to Secretary of State Hull today, it may make a general policy statement regarding the U.S. basic principles presented to Kurusu and Nomura by Secretary of State Hull on November 26th. If this statement is the same as that declared by the semi-official Japanese news agency Domei News Agency, then peace talks will collapse, resulting in a signal for Britain and the U.S. to implement the naval blockade in the Pacific that they have already prepared. Furthermore, there have been frequent unofficial reports recently from the Far East that U.S. ships are being escorted by the navy. Observers say that if the U.S.-Japan situation continues to deteriorate, escorting will be extended in the Pacific. Even if Japan presents assurances today, it seems unlikely that the U.S. will consider them satisfactory unless they are accompanied by a real demonstration of goodwill, such as withdrawing Japanese troops from Vietnam.</p>
<p>The general opinion in Washington is that although Tokyo is unwilling to accept U.S. conditions, war can still be avoided if Japanese troops do not engage in new acts of aggression. Even if Japan formally rejects U.S. conditions, there are other possibilities for delaying a conflagration through diplomatic techniques, such as Tokyo being willing to discuss the matter with Britain or other countries when the time is right. Japan's final means of avoiding conflict could be to adopt a "wait-and-see" policy. Authoritative sources say that in their opinion, the greatest danger is that extremist army leaders will exceed the prudence used by the Tokyo government and launch attacks on Thailand or the Yunnan-Burma Road, thereby repeatedly causing conflict.</p>
<p>Old Konoe Principles Resurrected, Japan Claims It Is Still Seeking Understanding with the U.S.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, December 9th - A spokesman for the Information Bureau told foreign reporters today that Japan and the U.S. will continue negotiations in a sincere spirit to find a common plan to maintain peace in the Pacific. He said that if it were not in a sincere spirit, there would be no need to prolong diplomatic talks. He continued by referring to the remarks made by Hull to reporters on the 3rd of this month, saying that if the reported news were accurate, the Japanese authorities would be deeply surprised that the U.S. has a clear misunderstanding of Japan's Far East policy. In short, the reason for starting negotiations was the existence of this misunderstanding. The basic policy of Japan in the war against China has been announced by the government several times, and the basic policy announced by Konoe when he was prime minister was one of them. Japan's policy is not based on territorial ambition, nor is it a demand for reparations, but only seeks peace and economic cooperation between China and Japan. At present, the overall situation in China has become contradictory due to the continuation of the war, but I believe that Japan's basic policy is already well known to you. Now, the incidents of misunderstanding all involve China and Vietnam. In fact, the dispatch of Japanese troops to Vietnam was in accordance with international agreements, and there are many precedents in history. A reporter asked about the total number of Japanese troops sent to Vietnam, and the spokesman refused to disclose it, only saying that the number did not exceed the limits stipulated in the agreement, which the Vichy government had already tacitly approved. He was also asked whether Bannell's statement when he met with reporters on the 3rd of this month that there was no progress in the negotiations was true. The spokesman replied that this was really not worth worrying about, but that the two sides still had many points of disagreement. It should be known that since both sides have clarified all the points, it can be said that there has been progress in the negotiations. President Roosevelt's question is about to be answered, but Hull's memorandum of November 26 has not yet been answered. I think there will also be an answer to this, but I cannot say when it will be issued. There are reports in Japanese newspapers that the U.S. is now trying to prolong the talks to buy time. Does he agree? The spokesman replied that he did not think the U.S. government necessarily did this deliberately, and that both sides are still continuing talks in good faith to find a common plan. If one side is not sincere, then there is no need to continue the talks. A reporter said that he noted Foreign Minister Togo's recent statement that the results of the U.S.-Japan talks would soon be clear. The spokesman replied that in diplomatic dealings of the current kind, the term "soon" is difficult to define.</p>
<p>White House Holds Important Meeting to Comprehensively Review the Far East Situation</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, December 5th - President Roosevelt met yesterday with House Democratic Leader McCormack, Vice President Wallace, House Speaker Rayburn, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, Senate Democratic Leader Hill, Senate Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Connally, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman George. Afterwards, reporters were told, "This meeting conducted a comprehensive study of all aspects of the Far East issue, especially on issues relating to the protection of U.S. territory and interests vital to U.S. survival."</p>
<p>Nazi Diplomacy Deployed, Washington Closely Watching</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, December 5th - President Roosevelt, at yesterday's meeting with congressional leaders, is believed to have discussed the strategic position of the Philippines, now surrounded by Japanese military concentrations. A congressional leader said upon leaving the White House, "The situation seems quite serious." Later, President Roosevelt also met with Secretary of the Navy Knox, possibly to discuss naval strategy in the Pacific. Some people in Washington believe that the activities of German diplomats in Shanghai are trying to influence Tokyo's reply, especially because U.S. conditions include demanding that Japan withdraw from the Axis. They also believe that the Nazi strategy may have been drafted by Captain Schultze-Naumburg and his staff in Shanghai meetings, with the aim of strengthening Japan's attitude to continue the war of nerves in the Pacific. This move would force the powerful fleets of Britain and the U.S. to be unable to spare themselves for the war in the Atlantic. After the White House meeting, there is no doubt that the Philippines defense in the current defense spending bill will be approved without opposition. The supplementary defense expenditure of $8,243,000,000 includes funds to maintain the recently advised 160,000 Philippine troops. New York Republican Representative Taber said in the House, "I would not be surprised if Japan's actions force us to defend the west coast of Hawaii and the Philippines."</p>
<p>British Naval Minister Re-Warns Japan, Time to Wake Up</p>
<p>Reuters, Bristol, December 5th - Naval Minister Alexander warned Japan today not to continue its aggression, saying, "It is hoped that wise advice within Japan will prevent those who seem to be leading its people into new wars of aggression. This threat has not yet passed, and aggression may be imminent."</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, December 5th - Congressman May declared today that if he were Secretary of State, then "Japan will accept our conditions, or follow after them." Asked if "follow after them" meant declaring war, May replied in the affirmative, "Unless we do not declare war and send our navy to bomb Tokyo directly."</p>
<p>United Press International, New York, December 5th - Yesterday's editorials in New York newspapers were even more pessimistic about the possibility of the U.S. and Japan maintaining peace in the Pacific. Renowned journalist Walter Lippmann wrote in the "Herald Tribune," "Our country is for the first time on the verge of a truly total war." He said that in the past two years, President Roosevelt had discovered the danger of the situation in the Pacific and had done his best to avoid war, but that current efforts had clearly failed. An editorial in "The New York Times" stated, "After four years of war of attrition, Japan's economic pressure is becoming increasingly serious, and military leaders still want to choose the path of further aggression, which has made a big mistake. By next March, Japan's expenses will reach 6.5 billion, which is far from the 3 billion compared to last year's income, causing the current inflation and the rising standard of living of the people."</p>
<p>U.S.-Japan Views Diametrically Opposed, Talks Likely Doomed</p>
<p>United Press International, Chongqing, December 5th - Chongqing officials declared today that Secretary of State Hull's recent statement on the Pacific situation can give those on one hand who hope that the Washington talks will continue, and on the other hand awaken the Japanese who are increasing troops in Vietnam. Hull attacked Japan's military autocracy in the occupied areas, and said that the Washington talks have never reached the stage of real negotiation. Hull clearly declared the differences between U.S. and Japanese policies, and that if Japan does not change its plans, then there is not even a basis for continuing negotiations. But Japan does not seem likely to change its policy of expansion. Chongqing officials also said that Japan's attempt to gain a respite will not be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, December 5th - Chinese officials welcome the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Hull to reporters on Wednesday. This morning, all newspapers published it with large headlines. Semi-official sources said that Japan's delaying tactics have likely doomed the fate of U.S.-Japan negotiations.</p>
<h3>Semi-Official Japanese News Agency Declares U.S. Conditions Absolutely Unacceptable, Tokyo Newspapers Continue to Arbitrarily Attack U.S.</h3>
<p>United Press International, Tokyo, December 5th - The semi-official Domei News Agency today directly criticized the U.S.'s attitude towards Japan and said that Japan could not accept the U.S.'s "peace proposals." Domei News Agency relayed the opinions of diplomatic observers, believing that Japan could never accept the U.S.'s demands, and that these demands could never be adopted as the basic conditions for negotiations in order to obtain a reasonable solution (the U.S.'s demands include the withdrawal of Japanese troops from China and Vietnam, and equal trade rights and interests in the Far East). Domei News Agency and local Japanese newspapers continue to fiercely attack the U.S., especially focusing on the document sent by Secretary of State Hull to Japan. Hull condemned Japan for establishing a military violent regime in the occupied areas of Asia, saying that Japan relied on military conquest and satiated itself by oppressing the conquered peoples. Domei News Agency said that Hull's announcement of the details of the negotiations in this way made the situation even more serious, and also said that since the U.S. sent Japan its minimum demands, there has been no progress in the negotiations. Hull's statement is sufficient to show that the U.S. lacks sincerity in the negotiations, and that the U.S. still plans to bind Japan with outdated principles, which have long been inapplicable even in the previous Far East situation. "Yomiuri Shimbun" accused the U.S. of "insulting Japan" and said, "The views of Japan and the U.S. are completely opposed, which is sufficient to show that there is no hope of compromise." The nationalist extremist newspaper "Hochi Shimbun" accused the U.S. of ignoring the "new situation in East Asia," saying, "Once Japan is forced to break through the anti-Japanese encirclement to obtain its own survival and power, the responsibility should be borne by the U.S." "Asahi Shimbun" said that Hull's demands were tantamount to "destroying faith" in Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Moves South, Australia Confirms, Cabinet Drafts Extensive War Preparedness Plan, Australian-Made Bombers Arrive in Singapore, Dutch East Indies Decides to Defend Oil Sources with All Its Might</h3>
<p>United Press International, San Francisco, December 5th - The Australian Associated Press announced today that reports of the Japanese navy moving south have been confirmed. While Australian authorities confirmed the Japanese navy's move south, the cabinet held two meetings in San Francisco instead of Canberra to maintain closer contact with the military.</p>
<p>United Press International, Melbourne, December 5th - The Australian War Cabinet revealed yesterday that the Cabinet has completed an extensive plan to place the entire country on a new "emergency basis" once the war extends to the Pacific. It is understood that the details of the plan were discussed at a meeting of military leaders and ministers on Wednesday night. This new plan will only be implemented when war breaks out in the Pacific, which shows the severity of the crisis currently viewed by Australia.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, December 5th - A large number of Bristol Beaufort medium bombers arrived in Singapore today. These aircraft were built in Australia and flew directly here from Australia.</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, December 5th - Yesterday, a government spokesman declared on the radio that, as a precaution, a plan to restrict the use of oil has now been drafted, which will be implemented if the war extends to the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies' oil sources must be defended to the last man before they are destroyed. Therefore, if the enemy wants to seize the oil sources, they must sacrifice a large number of soldiers, and the result will ultimately be in vain. The oil produced by the Dutch East Indies is not only sufficient to supply the Dutch East Indies' defense and the Allied forces in the Far East, but also sufficient to supply the Dutch East Indies' households, and there is still a large amount left over to be exported to Malaysia and Australia. The Dutch East Indies' oil industry produces all the oil products needed in peacetime and wartime, including aviation fuel and fuel oil. In the near future, the Dutch East Indies will also produce lubricating oil for its own use.</p>
<h3>Two Million Volunteers Mobilized, Thailand Prepared, Emergency Bill Approved by Congress, British and U.S. Embassies Advise Citizens to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, December 5th - The Thai Congress passed the government emergency bill at first reading yesterday afternoon, authorizing the government to issue all orders during emergencies, and the Minister of Justice, when introducing the bill, declared that it was temporary in nature, aimed at maintaining the country's security and public tranquility, and eliminating the activities of the fifth column. It is expected that the bill will soon become law.</p>
<p>United Press International, Bangkok, December 5th - Although Thailand's neighboring countries are actively preparing for war, the tension in Bangkok has eased somewhat this week. The general public is preparing to celebrate the constitutional anniversary on December 8th and has no time to pay attention to the international situation. The foreign community in Bangkok is quite tense, but according to the United Press International, only a few British people will follow the evacuation advice issued by the British Embassy yesterday. Only five families of missionaries among the U.S. citizens have decided to leave Thailand and return to the U.S., but they had already booked their seats before the U.S. Embassy issued the evacuation advice. Bangkok's official radio suddenly stopped this week warning the public of the proximity of war and the need to guard against the activities of the fifth column, and called on the public to do their best to make Thailand self-sufficient and did not pay too much attention to the presence of Japanese troops in Vietnam, but the authorities are quietly carrying out national defense preparations, and military guards are stationed at all military strongholds and bridges, especially the roads leading to the airports. The plan to evacuate women and children from Bangkok in an emergency is also nearing completion. Although military preparations are of course kept secret, the "Sri Krung" newspaper stated today that 2 million people in various provinces have volunteered for military service. At the same time, authorities announced today that the Thai fleet in the Gulf of Siam has been ordered to be on alert.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, December 5th - A Japanese source in Bangkok said that the British embassy has advised British citizens, including Indians, to evacuate Thailand immediately, and the U.S. embassy issued the same notice on November 30th. There are currently about 300 British citizens and 30,000 Indians in Thailand.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Takes Emergency Measures, Police Cancel Holidays, Food Control Implemented</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, December 5th - Hong Kong quietly continues to prepare for the emergency situation today. The most recent measures are the cancellation of police holidays and food control. The registration procedures for residents who usually eat Western food have been completed, and 1,000 Chinese cooks are being recruited to work in public canteens. At the same time, Dutch Consul Middelburg has also advised all Dutch citizens who do not necessarily have to stay in Hong Kong to evacuate. Dutch citizens are still continuing to move to Macau, with only 80 people remaining in Hong Kong, including 24 consular staff.</p>
<h3>Japanese Citizens Evacuate Singapore and Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, December 5th - A Thai ship sailed to Bangkok today, carrying more than 20 Japanese businessmen from Malaya. After arriving in Bangkok, they will probably transfer to a Japanese ship to return home. The president of the "Toho News," a Japanese news agency that broadcasts Domei News Agency news, issued his last press release yesterday, saying that he had something to do and was scheduled to return to Japan today. The agency is temporarily closed. A reporter from Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun left here today, but a representative from Asahi Shimbun is still staying.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, December 5th (Special Dispatch) - Domei News Agency stopped sending press releases on December 1st. Most of its staff have also retreated to Macau, with only a few staff members remaining here.</p>

<h3>Chengdu Economic Inspection Team Uncovers Multiple Hoarding Cases; Banks and Businesses Are the Most Numerous; Authorities Decide on Severe Sanctions</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The price stabilization work of the Economic Conference has become more active. After three meetings held on Thursdays and Wednesdays of the past two weeks, chaired by Committee Member Chiang, the work has become even more vigorous. The Chengdu Economic Inspection Team of the Conference announced that it had uncovered 17 hoarding cases on the 24th of last month, the majority of which involved banks and businesses. Four so-called gentlemen and one public official were involved. The hoarded goods included approximately 16,000 shi of rice, 50,000 shi of rapeseed, 140,000 jin of rapeseed oil, and over 70,000 bundles of firewood, as well as wheat, cloth, and coal. The announcement stated that these banks, merchants, and public officials disregarded the millions of soldiers at the front and the majority of the people in the rear who were suffering from hunger and cold, and were truly criminals of the nation, deserving of severe sanctions to satisfy public opinion. A draft of the central social affairs department was issued on the uncovering of hoarding cases, which pleased the public and gave them confidence that the government would take further effective measures. It was also stated that authoritative figures believed that banks and merchants should bear the majority of the responsibility for the price problem, and therefore should be severely sanctioned and absolutely prohibited from establishing subsidiary enterprises. According to well-informed sources, the cases uncovered so far are only "flies," and several well-known "tigers" are being secretly monitored. (5th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Confiscation of Hoarded Goods and Arrest of Criminals</p>
<p>The Chengdu Economic Inspection Team of the Executive Yuan's Economic Conference has been investigating the hoarding of grain and daily necessities in Chengdu and nearby counties for several months. On the 24th of last month, they, together with local government agencies and military police, confiscated large quantities of hoarded rice and daily necessities and arrested the criminals, greatly pleasing public opinion. The details of the case are as follows: (1) The Pixian Yanye Bank hoarded 15 warehouses of rice, totaling 4,300 shi, and issued warehouse receipts. The bank manager, Chen Zhongchu, has been arrested and sent to the military headquarters for interrogation. (2) The Pengxian Fuchuan Bank hoarded 2,000 shi of rice, 200 shi of rapeseed, and over 150 shi of wheat, and issued warehouse receipts. The manager, Ye Liuxi, has been arrested and sent to the military headquarters for interrogation. (3) Yongfenghe Company hoarded over 20,000 jin of rapeseed oil and over 40 shi of rapeseed. The manager, Cao Ziming, has been arrested. (4) Chuan Zuyu, a staff member of the Sichuan Provincial Government Price Adjustment Committee, hoarded over 40,000 bundles of pine firewood. (5) Li Wenguang hoarded over 200 tons of black coal. (6) Chengdu Zhonghe Pharmacy hoarded over 200 bolts of cloth. (7) Chengdu Gao Shuangsheng hoarded over 30,000 bundles of firewood. (8) Wu Shaozhang, the warehouse director of the Chengdu Chuankang Pingmin Bank, took the opportunity of hoarding military grain to privately hoard over 2,000 double shi of rice. It was also discovered that he was leading a group of rice brokers who were colluding with unscrupulous merchants to buy and sell goods. (9) Li Shaocheng, a tobacco merchant in Pixian, hoarded over 200 shi of rice and over 200 shi of rapeseed. (10) He Shusan, a tobacco merchant in Pixian, hoarded over 200 shi of rice. (11) Han Xuexuan, an oil merchant in Pengxian, hoarded over 70,000 jin of rapeseed oil and over 200 shi each of rice and rapeseed. (12) The local gentry Lv Jinting and Liu Jinxing in Pengxian hoarded over 1,000 shi of rice. (13) Zhou Ranfu in Chengdu hoarded over 400 bolts of indanthrene cloth. (14) Wu Zhang, the manager of the Xindu County Bank, purchased grain in the name of the Chengdu Grain Supply Office. His privately hoarded portion, totaling over 1,000 double shi, has been confiscated, and Wu Zhang has been arrested and sent to the military headquarters for interrogation. His warehouse receipts and documents for manipulating the market have also been confiscated. Wu Zhang also hoarded over 6,000 double shi of rapeseed, which has also been confiscated. (15) The Juxingcheng Bank purchased rapeseed in Xindu and issued warehouse receipts, affecting the price of oil. Over 11,000 double shi of hoarded rapeseed have been confiscated, and the bank's employee, Wei Jianlinzhao, has been arrested. All forged disaster relief registers and documents for issuing warehouse receipts have been confiscated. (16) Liu Jinxiu and others in Pengxian hoarded over 1,000 double shi of rice and over 1,000 double shi of rapeseed, totaling over 20,000 jin of rapeseed oil, which have all been confiscated. The Chengdu Juxingcheng Bank hoarded over 20,000 jin of rapeseed oil, which has been confiscated.</p>
<p>After receiving reports on the cases, the Economic Conference immediately handed over the rice cases to the Chengdu military headquarters for punishment in accordance with the Emergency Period Grain Handling Punitive Regulations. Regarding the cases of hoarding daily necessities, the provincial government instructed the local authorities to severely punish them in accordance with the Emergency Period Measures for Punishing Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities. Regarding the illegal hoarding and business operations of banks, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to audit the accounts and instructed the competent authorities to handle the matter in accordance with the Emergency Period Temporary Measures for the Management of Banks. The prohibition of hoarding grain and goods, and the prohibition of banks from directly engaging in commerce or hoarding goods, or from operating in the name of agency departments, trade departments, or trust departments, have long been clearly announced by the government. The Ministry of Finance has also issued a circular to all banks and money shops in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces to cease lending on grain mortgages, with the intention of ensuring military and civilian food supplies, stabilizing prices, supporting the war effort, and striving for final victory. However, these unscrupulous banks, merchants, and illegal public officials dared to disregard the law and hoard and manipulate goods, raising market prices, and did not care that millions of soldiers at the front and the majority of the people in the rear were suffering from hunger and cold. They are truly criminals of the nation, deserving of severe sanctions to satisfy public opinion. (4th dispatch)</p>
<p>Restrictions on Establishing Banks and Money Shops</p>
<p>Chongqing: In the rear areas of China, especially in Chongqing, the number of newly established banks and money shops has been increasing continuously in recent years, causing credit expansion and even engaging in hoarding. The recent resurgence of price increases is largely due to these newly emerging financial institutions. The Economic Conference has taken note of this and decided at its meeting yesterday to restrict the establishment of private firms. Furthermore, the Executive Yuan meeting the day before yesterday decided that all public and private construction projects that are not directly related to the war effort and production may be prohibited from being altered or extended. These measures indicate that the government is aware of the dangers of inflation. (4th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Ministry of Finance has ordered all banks and money shops to complete re-registration procedures. Banks and money shops are credit institutions that have a significant impact on social finance. The National Government has previously promulgated regulations on bank registration and the Ministry of Finance has formulated detailed rules for the implementation of bank registration regulations, which have been promulgated and implemented. All businesses engaged in banking and money exchange must obtain a business license approved by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with the law before they can be established. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued circulars for implementation. However, it has recently been found that some banks, money shops, and money exchanges that have already opened in Chongqing have not yet been registered in accordance with the law. It is now heard that the Ministry of Finance, in order to stabilize social finance and protect the interests of the people, has again issued a notice to the Chongqing Bankers and Money Changers Association, requiring all banks, money shops, and money exchanges that have already opened in the city but have not yet registered with the Ministry to complete the registration procedures within two weeks of receipt of the notice. Failure to do so will result in the Ministry taking action in accordance with the law. The order has been delivered to the Chongqing Bankers Association and the Money Changers Association, which will forward it to the respective banks, money shops, and money exchanges for prompt compliance.

It is hoped that colleagues across the country will respond enthusiastically and jointly support this righteous cause, so that the rights of dependents of soldiers across the country will be guaranteed, and soldiers at the front can devote themselves to battle without worries, which will greatly benefit the future of the war effort.

<p>Reuters, Moscow, 5th: Stalin and Molotov signed a Soviet-Polish treaty of friendship and mutual aid with Polish Prime Minister Sikorski and Ambassador Cot in Moscow yesterday, covering two main points: (1) The two countries, together with Great Britain and other Allied nations, and with the assistance of the United States, will fight until total victory and the destruction of the German army. (2) Polish forces in the Soviet Union will cooperate with the Soviet army as friendly neighbors, working hand in hand in a spirit of mutual respect for their obligations.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Implementing Joint Efforts to Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>The price controls implemented by the authorities of the two concessions have been extremely effective. Even with the current changes in the international situation, the withdrawal of American troops and Anglo-American expatriates, and the return of Dutch and British ships to Southeast Asia, the Shanghai market remains calm and orderly, showing no signs of panic or agitation. There is also a marked absence of speculation and manipulation. Without the prior price controls, rice prices would have soared to 200-plus yuan, and the prices of all essential daily necessities would have surged uncontrollably to unimaginable levels. The fact that hoarders and market manipulators have been deterred and prices and people's livelihoods have been stabilized is all thanks to this initiative!</p>
<p>However, the public still feels somewhat dissatisfied, mainly because the price-controlled goods are mostly imported. Based on general purchasing experience, these imported goods are often available in name only, with prices but no actual products. Some say that to obtain these price-controlled goods, one must go to the large stores. But the large stores all give the same answer: in the past, one could obtain the goods even at a high price, but now, even if one is willing to pay a price that is no less than before, because the retailers have lost control, it is impossible to buy them. This is where the problem lies, which will lead to the secret breakdown of price controls. If one wants to obtain the goods, one must not only pay a price higher than the controlled price but also be familiar with the store. Even if one is willing to pay a high price, one cannot guarantee success. Since people are willing to resort to painful measures, who would report it? Moreover, for transactions that violate price controls, who would issue an invoice? Therefore, it is not easy to trace violations through invoices. If an invoice is available, it must be due to a momentary oversight. Those who are accustomed to malpractice would rather not leave evidence in other people's hands, lest they bring trouble upon themselves. Therefore, to correct this problem, it is necessary to further liaise with import trading companies, not only controlling the retail prices but also controlling the retail stores. The import trading companies should entrust trustworthy stores with whom they have long-standing relationships to sell the goods at the fixed prices at their retail outlets, without going through agents or wholesalers. Customers can purchase from these authorized stores, ensuring widespread distribution to meet consumer demand and preventing manipulation by those offering "prices but no goods." Alternatively, the trading companies could sell directly to consumers, but there is concern that the trading companies lack the manpower for this, or that they are too lazy to do so, which would still inconvenience customers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the goods with publicly fixed prices are mostly imported foreign goods, which are not essential for most Chinese people but are only enjoyed by a small number of Americans. The people in charge of these price controls are mostly Westerners, who naturally find it easier to interact with other Westerners. Moreover, the need for price controls is not limited to the Chinese. The goods that Westerners trade and enjoy are also subject to manipulation and hoarding in the market, so they are also eager to take action. And the first collaborators are the import merchants. Since they are imported goods, and the prices are publicly fixed, they do not differentiate between what is needed by the Chinese and what is exclusively enjoyed by the Westerners, but set and announce prices for everything. This is as it should be. However, the general demand from the Chinese population, apart from rice and daily necessities, is for flat prices for pancakes, fried dough sticks, tofu, vegetables, and radishes. Flour is affected by the domestic wheat control and depends only on imported wheat, leading to the closure of most local flour mills. Even when they are operating, the output is far from meeting market demand. Everything sold on the market is imported flour, and imported flour cannot escape the law of supply and demand dictated by the black market. Moreover, even with the same imported flour, prices vary greatly depending on the storage location, making price control difficult. It is now reported that flour is priced at forty yuan per bag. Is this price universally available at retail outlets to meet the needs of residents, or is it only for use by businesses making pancakes, steamed buns, and noodles, excluding residents? It should be known that there are quite a few people who rely on flour for their meals. As for the high prices of fried dough sticks and tofu, one cannot help but think back to the source of oil and beans, which share the same fate as wheat, being subject to the so-called control. This control not only restricts exports but also increases costs and raises market prices. It has been said by people in the Northern goods industry that the prices of Northern goods are much higher than before. Peanuts, which used to cost a few cents a catty, now sell for two yuan and several dimes. Persimmon cakes, which used to be insignificant, now sell for one yuan and six or seven dimes a catty. This is not because the cost of raw peanuts and persimmons is high, but because the paper currency used locally is valued much higher than the legal tender, resulting in the high prices of Northern goods after conversion. Recently, this trend has shown a great expansion of its scope to seek temporary gains, but whether this aspiration can be realized depends on the changes in the situation. However, whether prices will change in the future depends on the strength of the friction encountered by the legal tender. However, the legal tender will ultimately remain the legal tender, so there is no need to doubt it. Looking at how the authorities of the two concessions are responding to the environment, they are showing a harmonious and coordinated style everywhere. This is because they prioritize local security and aim to stabilize people's livelihoods, regardless of other considerations. They are working hard, but it is still difficult to say whether they can achieve their wishes in this way and alleviate the difficulties of people's livelihoods. Even things like vegetables, radishes, fish, meat, and other foods are all expensive, precisely because there are so-called blockade lines around the concessions, and the sales have a monopoly market, resulting in various restrictions on the source. In fact, what channels are there for goods flowing into Shanghai to be exported now, and why must there be multiple blockades and controls, which makes no sense? Therefore, to stabilize prices in Shanghai, it is necessary to resolve the obstacles to stabilizing prices through cooperation. Otherwise, even if there is a price stabilization method, if the source of goods is controlled and extortion is insatiable, it will still fail to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if foreign merchants are committed to stabilizing local prices, then there should be no exceptions to the methods, and there should be no preferential treatment. Moreover, since they are all citizens of Shanghai, all their rights and obligations should be the same. The old concepts of self-importance, which were once held in high regard, should now be swept away with the new tide of cleansing and reform. It has been said that the supply and distribution of price-controlled goods is uneven. People's words cannot be fully believed, but there is no smoke without fire. However, a clear example is the sale of kerosene. Only seventeen retail stores are allowed to sell a limited amount of kerosene to Chinese citizens at the controlled price, while foreigners can obtain oil vouchers and purchase the kerosene they need at the nearby company service stations. The company's intention was probably to prevent Chinese people from using the oil vouchers for hoarding. In reality, how many Chinese people have the intention to hoard oil? Without the support of people in the industry, they would have no way to hoard it. Therefore, it is believed that if there are no oil vouchers, then so be it. If there are oil vouchers, then there should be no distinction between Chinese and foreigners. Under the same conditions, they should receive the same treatment. Otherwise, they should all purchase from retail stores, which may not be a fair way. However, this does not mean that oil vouchers are necessary. It is only hoped that the oil companies will take effective measures to ensure that all citizens can purchase a limited amount of oil from their neighboring stores at the controlled price at any time and in any place, without being limited to these seventeen specific retail stores.</p>
<h3>Red Army on the Northern Front Counterattacks Successfully, Breaks the Kalinin-German Line, German Offensive South of Tula Repulsed, Soviet Forces on the Southern Front Continue to Pursue Collapsing German Army</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 5th - Soviet news last night claimed that the Soviet forces launching fierce attacks on the Rostov and Moscow fronts have achieved great successes, inflicting terrible losses on the German army. The Soviet forces have repulsed the strong German offensive on the Tula front south of Moscow and forced the Germans to retreat to their old positions.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 5th - According to news from Compbell Heath, Soviet tank units on the left flank of Moscow shattered a powerful German offensive and broke through the Nazi line at Kalinin, forcing the Germans to retreat several miles. The dispatch said that the Soviet forces took possession of the extremely important stronghold "K." Moscow Radio claimed that the German troops around Rostov were still fleeing, with at least 30,000 Nazi casualties. Fierce fighting is still taking place around Taganrog.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - According to the latest battle reports, General Timoshenko's great offensive in southern Soviet Union has driven the German army back five miles outside of Taganrog. Heavy snow is falling in all areas of the front, and the German army is suffering greatly from a lack of food and winter clothing.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - German forces on the Eastern Front are still retreating west of Taganrog along the Sea of Azov coast. Soviet forces on the Moscow front are advancing in three areas of Tikhvin (110 miles southeast of Leningrad). This is the main development announced by Moscow officials in the past few hours. After the German advance east from Kursk (halfway between Moscow and the Sea of Azov) was blocked, they have switched to defensive positions. In this area, especially the Soviet forces east of Orel, are still in danger, and in the battles of Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets west of Moscow, the Soviet forces are still under threat. The German side has transferred tank and infantry reinforcements. The breakthrough point in the Mozhaisk area was quickly repulsed. Soviet forces on the southeastern front have recovered four villages in the Stalinogorsk area and more than twenty villages in the Kashira area. Soviet forces on the southern front are now following the retreating German forces of Zhytomyr and advancing alongside them, cutting off the rear of several axis units that were slower to retreat. They have reached Taganrog and are advancing sixty-five miles west to Oppol to pursue the remnants of General Kleist's forces. So far, the Soviet forces have captured 1,011 tanks, 1,110 artillery pieces, and many other war materials on this line. Vistov shot down over 100 German aircraft. Many German tanks on the Moscow front have also been frozen and unable to operate. The guerrillas are quite active, attacking German troops. The German side has claimed that Finnish forces have occupied Hanko (a Finnish enclave in the Gulf of Finland), but this has not yet been confirmed by the Soviet side. Guerrilla units are now more active. According to Soviet supplementary communiques, guerrilla units in the Kalinin area destroyed eleven bridges and destroyed a large amount of enemy ammunition and gasoline. The Soviet Air Force destroyed 24 enemy tanks, 333 trucks, 10 field guns, and many other military supplies on October 3rd, dispersing enemy infantry and cavalry. A Soviet unit in a certain area of the Western Front destroyed eight German artillery pieces, eleven mortars, and twenty-one machine guns in three days, killing 3,000 enemy soldiers. A Soviet unit in a certain area of the Southwestern Front destroyed 15 German tanks, 8 armored vehicles, and 40 trucks in two days, killing 700 enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>During the Battle of Rostov, German Divisional Commander Mitte Killed in Action</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 5th - The Soviet government's new report on recent developments on the Southern Front states that in the past 24 hours, General Karetnikov's Soviet forces continued to advance, expelling German troops from 30 villages. The Soviet forces under General Romisov also advanced, expelling enemy troops entrenched in dozens of villages. The German troops abandoned trucks loaded with a large amount of military supplies, and the enemy troops at the rear positions are also retreating. German Divisional Commander Schmidt has been killed near Rostov. One of the German divisions he led had 60 tanks, and after five days of fighting, only five remained. On Wednesday, the Soviet Air Force destroyed a motorized infantry column and attacked the enemy airfield at Taganrog, destroying eight German fighter planes and six twin-engine bombers. In air combat, they also shot down three German fighter planes and one bomber. A total of 21 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the entire Southern Front in one day. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses, with 2,500 casualties in one day. The total number of Soviet casualties on that line in the past two weeks has reached 23,506.</p>
<p>Rumor: Soviets Destroy Defensive Works, Preparing to Withdraw from Hanko Island</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 5th - According to news from the Finnish capital, the Soviet garrison on the Hanko Peninsula, under the cover of heavy fog on November 30th, secretly organized convoys to prepare for withdrawal, and fired intensive artillery fire at Finnish forces to block their advance. The sound of explosions was incessant at the time. The Soviet garrison in Hanko systematically destroyed all the buildings in the city. The Soviet rearguard began to hastily depart by boat today. Finnish infantry engineers and 1,000 Swedish volunteers advanced towards Hanko City. Because the Red Army had laid mines along the way, they had to proceed cautiously to avoid unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Finland Publicly Affiliates with the Axis Powers, Rejects Anglo-American Ultimatum, Situation Likely to Lead to British Declaration of War on Finland</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - Regarding the news from the Finnish capital that the British government has submitted an aide-memoire to the Finnish government, which expires at midnight today, the official side does not comment. It is heard that the British government has indeed given the Finnish government a "final opportunity," informing them that unless the Finnish government ceases its attacks on the Soviet Union, the British government will announce that a state of war exists between Britain and Finland. It has not been disclosed whether the Finnish government has responded to this. However, it is generally believed that the entire situation will be clarified by the end of the week at the latest. Previously, the British side had warned Finland of the danger of colluding with Berlin, but Finland subsequently joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. If Helsinki does not reply this time, or if its reply necessitates a British declaration of war, some believe that Britain will also declare war on Hungary and Romania.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - Today, responsible officials announced that the British government sent notes to Finland, Hungary, and Romania last weekend, with the aim of avoiding further deterioration of relations between them. At present, no disclosure can be made regarding the content of the notes, but it can be said that the deadline for a reply is today. As of now, none of the above three countries have replied. According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, the British government may continue to wait until midnight. If no reply is received by then, the situation may enter a new phase, and the British government will freely take the necessary measures.</p>
<h3>Germans in Paris Continue to be Assaulted</h3>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 5th - According to news from Paris, terrorist actions have resumed there. At 8:50 this morning, a cyclist assaulted a German major, firing six shots. The major was seriously wounded in the mouth. The incident occurred in the Sixth District, and the perpetrator fled the scene.</p>
<h3>German Forces in North Africa Building Fortifications, Preparing for a Prolonged Defense, Adverse Weather on the Libyan Front, British Forces Reorganizing and Resting</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 5th - The weather on the Libyan front is still quite bad, and air and other activities have been restricted. At the same time, the campaign has not ended, but is in a routine rest phase after the offensive. Both sides are now at rest, reorganizing their troops and carrying out repairs. British patrols continue to actively monitor enemy activities and probe their positions. About 100 German troops stubbornly holding the last outpost at Omar in Libya escaped on Sunday night and have been surrounded by South African armored forces. A New Zealand war correspondent reported from the front that although the corridor outside Tobruk was temporarily breached, the New Zealand troops bravely resisted the desperate German attacks, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the enemy. This point will ultimately be the decisive factor in the Libyan campaign. One German battalion now has only a company's worth of soldiers left. The New Zealand troops have also suffered significant losses, but fresh troops are now rushing to the front to attack the German forces, whose strength has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 5th - Since the start of the Libyan campaign, a total of 27 British fighter pilots who went missing in action have returned to duty, some on foot or by plane, and most by military vehicle.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - A Reuters correspondent reported from the British Air Force headquarters in the Western Desert that on Wednesday night, a large formation of British bombers attacked a large concentration of enemy vehicles east of Razac under the silver light of the full moon, dropping many tons of bombs. Yesterday, another large formation of British aircraft bombed a large arc-shaped German-Italian position. This arc-shaped position extends northeast from Gobi, 35 miles from Tobruk, to Adhan, and then 100 miles east to Siddi and Solum. At the same time, the British are currently reorganizing, and the British light armored vehicles responsible for screening are repeatedly in contact with enemy forces. The German forces on the western side seem determined to hold the line from Tobruk south to Gobi. They are now digging tank obstacles, gun positions, and trenches along this line. For Tobruk, they have built fortifications from Adhan northeast through Razac to defend it. General Rommel of Germany apparently hopes to have a "positional army" hold these defensive lines while using the remaining tanks for mobile warfare to contain the approaching British armored vehicles. In the fierce fighting in North Africa, the German army has benefited greatly from an excellent tank recovery organization. Many tanks that were damaged on the battlefield were recovered and repaired, and could return to battle within a few days. Although land warfare is now quiet, British aircraft continue to attack, repeatedly hindering German preparations.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - Today's Middle East communique announced that the fighting in Libya has intensified again. Axis forces attempted to break through the British encirclement line in the Razac area yesterday but were repulsed and heavily damaged. British forces launched a swift counterattack and recovered the small amount of land that had been lost. Most of the Razac battlefield is now in British hands. There are now no traces of Axis forces south of the Capuzzo road.</p>
<h3>Rumor: Germany Demands North Africa from France as a Base for Attacking Britain</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 5th - The Soviet official TASS news agency yesterday quoted well-informed sources in Istanbul as saying that Marshal Petain, during a meeting with German Air Force Commander Goering, agreed to allow the Axis powers to use Tunisia as a base for attacking Britain. TASS also said that the Italian reinforcements to Libya have been dispatched to Tunisia. It also said that "the dismissal of General Weygand, the appointment of a new French African commander, and the disguised German consulates stationed in North Africa all indicate that the German side is preparing to attack Britain from Tunisia."</p>
<h3>Five Divisions of the Southern People's Army Engage in Fierce Fighting with Germans</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 5th - Moscow Radio announced that the Serbian army now fighting the Germans in Yugoslavia has five divisions, well-equipped, led by General Draza Mihailovic. The number of German troops is similar.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 5th - News from Europe today says that 8,000 Serbian guerrillas are fighting 45,000 Axis troops in Yugoslavia. In the fighting or terrorist actions against Axis aggression, at least 1,100 people have been killed. Swiss Radio, citing news from Budapest, said that Serbian guerrillas recently destroyed an ammunition depot, killing 1,500 people. Moscow Radio said that Yugoslav guerrillas are holding the town of Rudnik, and Axis troops suffered 600 casualties.</p>

<h3>Manila Becomes a Center for Foreigner Evacuation; U.S. Troops and Dutch Nationals Stationed in Beiping Also Evacuate; Panama Ships Transporting Essentials to Shanghai; If the Situation Remains Unchanged in Two Weeks, British Shipping Might Resume</h3>
<p>American citizens wishing to leave Shanghai can board the French Postal Company's "D'Artagnan" ship, arriving in Shanghai on December 12th. The ship is scheduled to set sail on the 14th or 15th, taking the route through Manila and Haiphong to Saigon. Meanwhile, other shipping companies here, such as Java, Swire, and Jardine, are now refusing to sell tickets, anticipating no ships coming to Shanghai. According to an official of the American President Lines yesterday morning:</p>
<p>American Citizens Can First Evacuate to the Philippines</p>
<p>American citizens wishing to evacuate from Shanghai should first directly purchase tickets for the French Postal Company ship to Manila, then purchase tickets from the President Lines in Manila for ships to San Francisco. British shipping companies here indicate that no British ships are currently sailing to Shanghai, so they cannot sell tickets. As for the actions of British ships, they cannot be disclosed. Java Company also stated that it does not expect Dutch ships to come to Shanghai and will not sell tickets until receiving a telegram from the Batavia headquarters.</p>
<p>U.S. Troops Leaving Beiping, Dutch Nationals Also Evacuate</p>
<p>A Domei News Agency dispatch from Beiping on the 4th stated that the U.S. Embassy in Beiping notified the Japanese Embassy that the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Beiping would evacuate on December 12th, embarking from Qinhuangdao. Also, the Dutch Legation in Beiping notified the Hua-Chao-Kuei Association, mostly composed of Dutch educators.</p>
<p>Italian Troops Stationed in Shanghai Remain Static</p>
<p>An official of the Italian Embassy here yesterday morning denied the rumors that the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai would be transferred to Tianjin under the orders of the Italian government. According to him, "We have no such information." Captain Scafi, the Italian Embassy's naval attaché, also stated that he had not heard of this news. It is rumored that the Italian troops are preparing to board the Italian gunboats "Lepanto" and "Eritrea," currently docked in Shanghai, to go to Nanjing, then transfer by train to Tianjin. The "Eritrea" recently slipped into Shanghai.</p>
<p>French Shipping Provides Some Compensation</p>
<p>According to sources from the U.S. Consulate, although the evacuation of American citizens is facing unprecedented difficulties due to the disruption of shipping, the continued operation of ships belonging to the French Postal Company can still compensate. American citizens awaiting evacuation can take French postal ships to Manila and then transfer to ships to America. Passenger tickets for postal ships from Manila to America can be purchased from the American Postal Company in this city. British citizens wishing to evacuate can also first take French ships to the Philippines and then transfer to Singapore, India, or South Africa.</p>
<p>American Postal Company Announces Sailing Schedule</p>
<p>The French shipping company announced yesterday that its next ship, the "D'Artagnan," arrived in Shanghai on the 30th of last month and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou, scheduled to sail south on the 12th, passing through Manila (not stopping in Hong Kong) to Saigon. The American Postal Company also announced that its ships would depart from Manila twice in the second half of this month (approximately the "McKinley" and "Harrison" passenger ships will sail from Manila to San Francisco). In the fourth week of January and the first week of February next year, there will be one ship each sailing from the Philippines to San Francisco. In the second half of this month and the fourth week of next month, there will be one ship each sailing from Manila to Singapore, India, and South Africa's Cape of Good Hope. All ships of the Java Shipping Company have been suspended. Yesterday, the Java headquarters issued an order not to resume operations.</p>
<p>Panama Ships Busily Transporting Goods</p>
<p>The "Moranzan" (SS Moranzan) ship, operated by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at noon yesterday, carrying 27,699 bags of foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council, docked at Roosevelt Wharf. Unloading continued overnight, maintaining Shanghai's external transportation line and maintaining order. It is reported that the "Moranzan" ship will sail outbound in a few days, exclusively carrying goods for foreign merchants, not carrying passengers or goods for Chinese merchants. Also, the Panama ship "Ramona" arrived in Shanghai from Hongji yesterday noon, carrying war coal, docked at buoys 1 and 2 of Roosevelt Wharf. After unloading 3,500 tons of coal, it will sail outbound. The ship "Paoyueka" arrived in Shanghai from Sumatra, Dutch East Indies, at 3 p.m. yesterday, docking at Qichang Wharf in Pudong. The Panama ship "Utewa" set sail for Qingdao, Yantai, and Tianjin yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Postal Service Between Shanghai and Hong Kong Can Be Temporarily Maintained</p>
<p>With the withdrawal of British ships and the difficulty of shipping in Shanghai, postal transportation is also affected. Because mail from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Southeast Asian regions such as Singapore and the Dutch East Indies must pass through Hong Kong, the Shanghai Postal Administration, in addition to entrusting the Swire's "Anhui" ship sailing to Hong Kong to transport a batch of mail to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia, also entrusted the "Maler" ship the day before yesterday to continue carrying this batch to Hong Kong. The "Maler" ship is very small and usually does not carry mail. Now, due to the lack of ships, the post office temporarily negotiated to load mail. It is still difficult to determine whether there will be ships traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong in the future. If there are ships, regardless of their size, the post office will negotiate with them for postal transportation. The postal service between Shanghai and Hong Kong can still be maintained with difficulty.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson and Swire Ships May Resume Sailing</h3>
<p>The sudden suspension of British shipping, concentrating in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other places for naval deployment, has caused the stagnation of transportation on Shanghai's offshore routes. According to authoritative sources in the shipping industry yesterday, if the situation in the Far East does not change, ships of Jardine Matheson and Swire may resume sailing in two weeks. However, there is no hope for American ships to resume sailing before the U.S.-Japan negotiations reach a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<h3>Rong Wu Society Lectures on Scriptures</h3>
<p>The Rong Wu Scripture Lecture Society will hold lectures at the China Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road at 2 p.m. on the 7th. On that day, Shen Jue will lecture on the New Meaning of a Word in Wen Yi. Listeners should arrive on time.</p>
<h3>Primary School Principal, a Wealthy Chinese, Arrested for Stockpiling Flammable Liquids</h3>
<p>A Large Amount of Kerosene Stored Under the School's Staircase</p>
<p>The Lives of Over Three Hundred Students Threatened</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department has learned that the fire on Zhubaosan Road last Friday was caused by the stockpiling of flammable oil. A large-scale search was conducted in the concession for illegally stored flammable liquids. On Wednesday of this week, more than 250 gallons of kerosene were found in a Chinese-run school on Zhao Zhujiao Road. A certain wealthy person's residence on Xiahfei Road was also found to have stockpiled some flammable liquids. The kerosene found in the school on Zhao Zhujiao Road was stored under the staircase, threatening the lives of 320 students. The police confiscated the batch of kerosene, closed the school, and detained the school principal and staff for questioning, and revoked the licenses of all teachers to teach in the French Concession. French police officers then found multiple cans of kerosene, gasoline, petroleum, and acetone oil in a Chinese residence on Xiahfei Road. The Chinese person was also detained for questioning. Acetone oil is a highly flammable substance that can explode even without fire.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Shelter on Singapore Road Taken Over by the Municipal Council; Forty Beggars to Be Sent Daily; Major Walker Prepared to Receive Them</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to take over the Salvation Army beggar shelter on Singapore Road. The council's police department will send forty beggars to the shelter daily starting Monday. The Salvation Army is now preparing to receive these beggars.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Salvation Army</p>
<p>Head Major Walker stated that he was pleased to have the cooperation of the Municipal Council's police department to run the shelter. Starting next week, the police department will detain twenty male and twenty female beggars each day in the morning and afternoon, respectively, and hand them over to the shelter. He also stated that the shelter currently houses 450 people, mostly child beggars. They spend half the day studying and half the day working, currently learning four crafts: sewing, bamboo work, shoemaking, and hand-weaving woolen cloth. For child beggars, this type of</p>
<p>Half-Work, Half-Study</p>
<p>Method will continue to be implemented. Adult beggars will be repatriated to their places of origin as quickly as possible to the extent possible. Major Walker did not state that the Municipal Council formally asked him to continue sheltering beggars this morning. He is prepared to respond and accept this proposal.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Axis Powers Representatives to Hold a Meeting; Hitler's Close Friend Widmann Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that according to information obtained yesterday morning, representatives of the Axis powers in Shanghai will recently hold a meeting in Shanghai. Widmann, the former German consul in San Francisco, arrived in Shanghai last night. News from Washington yesterday morning also stated that there will be a meeting of Axis powers representatives in Shanghai, possibly to discuss the U.S.-Japan negotiations. As for Widmann, he is rumored to be a close friend of Hitler.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Officers of the Police Department Hold Meetings for Days</h3>
<p>The Japanese police officers of the Public Concession Police Department, led by Chief Inspector Watanabe as the center, along with inspectors Kakegawa and Gojima, and probationary inspector Furuya, and Japanese Section Inspector Umeoto, have been holding important meetings for several days. On the morning of the 4th, they continued to meet. As for the content of the meeting, it is kept strictly secret, so it is impossible to know. However, it is generally believed that the meeting must have discussed matters related to the newly established Section E and the police power issues north of the Suzhou Creek, as well as personnel changes for Japanese police officers.</p>
<h3>Delay in Coal Stock Registration; Direct Investigation to Be Conducted</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association started registering the coal stocks of its members on the 1st of this month. Many members have registered in recent days, and the deadline was yesterday. The association plans to compile a list of the registration results this morning and report it to the Fuel Committee of the Municipal Council for review. However, the association refused to make it public. According to sources close to the Coal Industry Association, about 250 members have registered this time, with a total coal stock of only about 300,000 tons. However, those familiar with coal estimate that the city's coal stock is definitely not so small, with a total of nearly 550,000 to 600,000 tons. The Fuel Committee has paid close attention to this and has decided to send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation to find out the truth. It is reported that the repeated postponement of reporting the coal stock registration results is due to the division of opinions among the coal industry committee members. According to a committee member of the Coal Industry Association yesterday, he repeatedly advocated strict handling of this coal stock registration, but was unsuccessful due to various obstructions. He hopes that the Fuel Management Committee will adhere to a fixed policy and not listen to unfounded statements. He believes that when evaluating the selling price of coal, the prices of Yanbai coal of the nine major import firms, including Dalong, Xinghua, Zhongyuan, Taihua, Huabei, Bing, Tongcheng, Dachang, Xinhua, and Yitai Xing, should be evaluated first. At the same time, coal stocks should be actively increased to reassure the public. In addition, it is learned that the registered coal types of the coal companies include the following: bituminous coal, Indian lumps and fines, Kailun lumps and fines, No. 1 lumps, No. 2 lumps, household lumps, train lumps, special fines, No. 1 fines, No. 2 fines, Changxing lumps and fines, Vietnamese lumps and fines; anthracite coal, Hongji lumps and fines, Haifeng lumps and fines, Mark, Yuedong, Gu, Xinhongji, Hebei, etc. Coal merchants are still trying to deceive the market. The Municipal Council should pay attention to this. The Public Works Bureau of the French Concession also sent a letter to the Coal Industry Association yesterday, requesting that the quantity of coal stocks be reported daily.</p>
<h3>Post Office Employees' Request to Prepay Salaries Approved by the General Office</h3>
<p>Shanghai postal employees requested an increase in living allowances. After Postmaster-General Chapellin forwarded the request to the General Office, the matter was of national importance and there was no result. The postal employees then requested that the Bureau approve the prepayment of salaries uniformly at 300 yuan to alleviate their urgent needs before a satisfactory result was obtained. After Postmaster-General Cha forwarded it to the General Office for approval, it is now learned that the General Office has approved the request. It is expected that the payment can be made by Monday or Tuesday next week to benefit the employees.</p>
<h3>Solar Eclipse Observation Results Not Very Satisfactory</h3>
<p>The results of the astronomical observatory's observation of the solar eclipse last month were not very satisfactory because there was a halo that day. Therefore, the observatory does not intend to publish the results of the observation. According to the observatory, there has been no high pressure in Siberia recently, so the climate in this city is relatively stable, and it will not be invaded by cold air in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Rumors of Obstructed Rice Transportation Proved Untrue; Panama Ships Transported 27,000 Bags Yesterday; Public Warehouse Committee Convenes to Discuss Next Year's Measures</h3>
<p>The Panama ship "Morozan" arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying a large amount of foreign rice purchased by the Department of Public Works from Rangoon and Singapore. Although Municipal Council officials did not specify the quantity of foreign rice, it is generally believed that the number is about 27,000 bags. Jardine Matheson, the manager of the ship, did not comment on whether more Panama ships would carry imported goods previously transported by British ships to Shanghai after the British ships withdrew from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Future Rice Arrivals Will Not Be Disclosed</p>
<p>Future Rice Arrivals Will Not Be Disclosed</p>
<p>When the reporter asked the Municipal Council spokesman whether "Morozan" carried 27,000 bags of rice, he evasively replied that the quantity of foreign rice was quite large and that the Bureau was constantly transporting rice to Shanghai according to its established policy. This matter is very important, and the exact number of foreign rice delivered each time cannot be disclosed. Shipping circles believe that "Morozan" also carried a small number of passengers. However, Jardine Matheson was unwilling to say more about this. It is noteworthy that the rumor that the Municipal Council's move to transport rice flour to suppress its price is now hindered by the lack of ships has been disproved by the arrival of "Morozan."</p>
<p>Public Warehouse to Hold General Meeting on the 8th</p>
<p>A person in charge of the Grain Public Warehouse Management Committee said yesterday, "Respectfully announcing, the organization of this committee was generated based on the founders' meeting on December 24th, Republic of China Year 29. Article 14 of the committee's charter stipulates, 'This committee will be tentatively set for one year of the Republic of China Year 30, but if the committee believes that there is a need to dissolve it early or continue to exist, it may convene the original founders and representatives of various industries to agree to deal with it.'

<p>Changing the Address for Receiving Foreign Rice</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Rice Industry Association, all rice shops lacking rice in the British and French Concessions must pay attention to the registration locations for receiving foreign rice stocks in the future. The association has agreed with the authorities of the two concessions yesterday that starting next week, all rice shops in the Public Concession that need foreign rice can bring their chops to Jardine Matheson at 220 Sichuan Road to register. All procedures are the same as receiving the Municipal Council's small rice. All rice shops lacking rice in the French Concession can register at nearby police stations. After determining the quantity to be sold, they must pay and take delivery of the goods. However, the foreign rice will still be supplied by the industries affiliated to the Bean and Miscellaneous Grain Industries Association.</p>

<h3>Medical Services in the Interior Progress Despite Lack of Equipment; People Live Simple Lives and Work Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>According to Ms. Lambden, recently arrived in Shanghai from the interior by the American Church, although medical services in the Chinese interior are lacking in equipment and talent, they have made significant progress. Ms. Lambden flew from Hong Kong to Chongqing and then traveled by post office car to Guiyang.

<p>Guiyang Hospital</p>
<p>Was lacking in talent, and doctors faced many difficulties due to poor equipment. During her stay in Guiyang, Ms. Lambden visited the General Office of the Chinese Red Cross, which is led by the Medical Department of the Lin.

Students in the interior work very hard, and even in extremely difficult circumstances, they can maintain high spirits and work enthusiastically. Their difficulty is the lack of books. She also visited various cooperatives in the interior that manufacture woolens, carpets, and gauze, all operated by the China Industrial Cooperatives.</p>

We wish to donate all proceeds from ticket sales, except for necessary expenses, to your newspaper to jointly support charity. Because the organization of our society and the target of ticket sales are all friendly classmates, the fundraising has been slow after the performance, so we have been late in submitting the donated funds. We hope for your understanding. Now that the ticket revenue has been cleared, a net surplus of 300 yuan in national currency has been calculated. We are sending it to you specially, hoping you will check and receive it." The scholarship fund received yesterday included 300 yuan from the Moonlight Drama Society, 100 yuan from Zhou Enyuan, and 20 yuan from Yuan Yuanyao, totaling 420 yuan.

<h3>Bandits Disguised as Gift-Givers Force Their Way into Residences with Threats</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 3:30 AM, three bandits, carrying a basket of eggs, went to the home of Xia Changshen, a local resident at No. 250, Lane 337, Xiaosha Ferry Road. Using the pretense of delivering eggs, they forced their way into the house. One of the bandits immediately pulled out a pistol and threatened Xia's wife, Ms. Xu, asking where Xia was. She replied that he was away at work and had not returned. The bandits then ransacked the house before leaving empty-handed, fleeing without a trace. It seems their intention was to kidnap Xia. Afterwards, Xia's wife, Ms. Xu, informed her husband, and they reported the incident to the police for investigation. Xia is currently a shareholder in the Xinchangde Dye Factory at No. 50, Lane 24, Jisi Fei'er Road, and also works as a staff member in a certain department.</p>
<h3>Woman Injured While Playing with a Gun</h3>

It is said that her injuries are severe, and her life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Gasoline for Taxis May Lead to Suspension of Service; Bicycles May Rise in Popularity</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, Shanghai may follow the example of major European cities by restricting the operation of taxis and prohibiting them from operating on Sundays. The Times reports that since the announcement that gasoline companies will reduce gasoline supplies by 50%, many car owners are selling their cars. Those who frequently rent taxis have expressed opposition upon hearing that fares will increase from six yuan to nine yuan per ride. Some believe that a 40% increase in fares is excessive. Taxi companies claim that the price increase only covers a portion of their operating expenses, as the authorities are planning to restrict their operations and prohibit their vehicles from operating on Sundays. Local residents believe it would be preferable to allow taxis to operate on Sundays rather than pay the exorbitant price of nine yuan for a twenty-minute ride. Passengers also argue that the current gasoline price is still 5.6 yuan per gallon, and the authorities are reducing the supply to companies by 40%, not 60% as claimed. Local residents anticipate that bicycles may become the only means of transportation for citizens in the future.</p>

<h3>Labor Children's Welfare Home Appeals for Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Labor Children's Welfare Home in this city takes in orphans and destitute children, providing them with appropriate education and achieving good results. Before the war, it gradually expanded, establishing five homes and accommodating over 2,000 children. After the August 13th Incident, all the homes were destroyed. Ms. Mei Shiyunying, the director of the home, worked hard and, in the spring of 1938, established a free elementary school in Jiancun, Yejiazhai, Yanping Road. In 1940, she also established a free school at the old site of the Bethel Hospital on Manufacturing Bureau Road in the Nanshi district. Together, the two locations accommodate over 700 orphans and destitute children, providing them with education and teaching them vocational skills so that they can become self-reliant when they grow up. Recently, prices have soared. The home needs at least 30 dan of rice per month, with other recurring expenses totaling at least 5,000 yuan per month. The home has no endowment fund, and all expenses rely on donations from all sectors. The home is currently raising funds, and the Gospel Radio Station will broadcast news on its behalf today. It is hoped that kind people from all walks of life will generously donate large sums of money to help these over 700 starving children.</p>

<p>The third act of Western Youth Basketball was staged last night. In the prelude, a Second Division battle, Yiguang defeated Yiguang by twenty-six to ten.

In the First Division battle between Lianxing and Zhongyi, it was generally expected before the game that Zhongyi would be unable to withstand the attack. However, once the two teams were in formation, everything overturned expectations. Zhang Zhaoxiang and Li Jiazhi of Zhongyi took the lead, impressively leading by four points. Huang Mao and Zhang Dulai fought hard, and Lianxing finally broke the duck egg. After Hu Guocheng made one free throw, Zhongyi increased the score by one or two points, taking the lead again. Lianxing worked hard to develop its power. Zhou Kong successively scored, and in an instant, a huge 12 points were achieved in one breath. Lianxing took the lead from behind. But Zhongyi was not discouraged and buried themselves in fighting. The first half was again chased to a close score of thirteen to fourteen. After the change of baskets, Lianxing easily switched to the original lineup. After Zhang of Zhongyi hit a goal, they were strongly pressured, and the offensive became difficult to launch again. The three generals, Pi Jingzhanpei, Dong Shaotang, Zhang Zhaoxiang, and Hu Guoding, the three main generals were all fined and dismissed first. Chen Shi Gu lost his center of gravity. Thus, Lianxing got their wish and the final result was forty-three to twenty-two. Lianxing achieved a great victory. Today's two games are both in the Second Division.</p>

<p>The small ball, four-army battle, organized by the Poor Children's Education Home on Jiaozhou Road to raise funds for the purchase of books for the library, invited Ruitang to play against Yiguang, and Fudan to face Mengshi, and also invited practitioners from the film and Shanghai opera circles to hold special performances. The war report was officially announced yesterday. However, at 6:00 PM last night, a notice was suddenly received from the person in charge of the hospital, saying that due to continuous rainy days, the construction of the court, which was originally limited to yesterday, was not completed as scheduled yesterday, so it had to be postponed for one day, and the battle will be relaunched tomorrow. All the programs will remain the same, that is, the performances of movie stars and Shanghai opera will also take the stage as usual. However, the enthusiastic fans who are eager to see and try to make a quick decision will have to wait another day to enjoy the eye-opener, which is not without regret. According to the Poor Children's Education Home, since the Coca-Cola Charity Race ended, the court has been deserted until now. It is a pity to let such a good field be deserted. Thousands of enthusiastic fans are also itching to try, deeply blaming the event for not happening again. Therefore, under this situation, the appeal of this four-army battle is many times greater than usual. For this reason, the ticket sales started yesterday and nearly a thousand tickets were sold in one day, so the grand event was delayed for one day, and the scene at the Poor Children's Education Home court will inevitably be declared full. In addition, the authorities also plan to invite the two remaining famous generals, Dai Jing and Jia Youliang, to appear on stage and help Yiguang and Ruitang respectively to increase the excitement of the competition. However, Dai Jia and another general, Zhou Guangzhong, will travel to Hong Kong, and the boat tickets have already been arranged. If a certain foreign transmission they are riding on can be decided for the game, otherwise they will have to reluctantly give it up. The departure date of the transmission line is usually kept secret and must be known tomorrow, so whether fans can enjoy this eye-opener depends on how lucky they are.</p>

<h3>Marital Knowledge</h3>

<h3>The Origin of Marital Happiness</h3>
<p>The reason why couples come together is nothing more than to pursue happiness in life. A single man or virgin, although the enjoyment of life can make them carefree; but in their hearts they always feel a lonely defect. This defect cannot be made up for with money or status. It must be the person in the heart - the lover - to be satisfied. There are many men and women in the world who suffer from lovesickness. They therefore lead to and become thin, and even age. But when the person in their heart arrives, her or his spirit and body are immediately recovered. We don't need to use distant facts to use metaphors. Just look at a couple who married for love. Because their long-cherished wishes have been fulfilled, they are mutually comfortable in body and mind, and a new interest has arisen in life. They must also cheer up in their studies and career, work together with one heart, and move forward. How happy and meaningful this is!</p>
<p>However, in fact, there are also many married men and women whose bodies and minds have been reversed, with no love at all, and who have fallen into the abyss of life's pain. What is the reason for this? According to medical advice, it is mostly because men committed masturbation and seminal emission in their early years, or indulged in prostitution and sores after marriage. The seminal gland fluid (semen), which dominates sexual health, is consumed too much, so the metabolic function is reduced, the development function is stagnant, and the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves are in a weakened state. When the sperm gate is loose, then all kinds of diseases such as nocturnal emission and leakage of essence, making turbid impotence, incomplete development, sperm thinness and infertility, and neurasthenia arise one after another. Such husbands, in married life, always perform weakness and incompetence, or even completely unable to do human affairs. This not only weakens the precious youth of the wife, but also how sad is the husband's heart? The happiness between husband and wife is like a light smoke-like illusion in them. What remains after the illusion is nothing more than a grim-faced demon! The only remedy is, according to the thousands of medical cases of world-renowned doctors, and my years of experience, taking the seminal gland hormone preparation "Seminal Hormone" is the most effective treatment. Because this agent can produce essence, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish the nerves one day and night after taking it. Taking it in summer has the same effect as in winter. Continuing to take it for half a month can also help promote development and adjust metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms must be completely cured.</p>
<p>Patient Zhao Xing, a native of Jiangning, 31 years old, suffered from early symptoms! The symptoms of impotence were very serious, and there was nocturnal emission during night sleep. Last month, he sought treatment from me, and I gave him a large amount of "Facts Speak Louder Than Words".</p>
<p>Healthy and Beautiful</p>
<h3>A Passionate Woman Inevitably Has Prominent Breasts</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>A likable and elegant American renowned physiologist, Dr. Samaher Saint-Manuel, once said, "A passionate woman inevitably has prominent breasts." The basis for this statement stems from the fact that the development of a woman's breasts is entirely due to the strength of her ovaries, the center of her endocrine glands. If this center can be healthy and strong, it will produce a large amount of internal secretions, which promote the development of female characteristics. In terms of physical appearance, the most prominent feature is high breasts, with nipples that are purple-orange, like the tower atop a conical mountain peak. In addition, the buttocks must also be very full, and the figure will be graceful, forming a healthy and beautiful curve, which is so intoxicating! As for emotions, due to the vigorous metabolism, she is often lively, intelligent, and amorous. Such a woman, with her gentle and healthy character and physique, wins praise and admiration in social interactions, becoming a social star. Once married, she is a typical virtuous wife and loving mother, filling the home with joy. The husband respects her as a heavenly being, which is truly glorious and gratifying. However, if she has a history of self-inflicted harm through tight binding of the breasts, irregular menstruation, persistent leucorrhea, malnutrition, or severe illnesses that impair the function of the ovaries and affect breast development, she will not only be prone to illness and pain and lose her beauty, but will also be despised by men, even abandoned and ignored! The only remedy is to take the ovarian preparation "Reproductive Hormone" for women, which is most effective. This agent is made from the secreted ovaries of healthy animals. Therefore, after taking it, the ovarian function can be nourished overnight, promoting metabolism, regulating menstruation, and warming the uterus to stop leucorrhea. If continued, it will surely make the breasts prominent, the buttocks full, the complexion rosy, and youth long-lasting in a short period.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission: Young Men, Quickly Embark on a Path of Self-Renewal</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Doctor Zhan Nianhui</p>
<p>Function will never wait for us; only we can wait for function. If function is missed, it will be difficult to find it back even with great effort. Regret at that time will be in vain! Learning in youth and acting in adulthood are special and important tasks in each stage of our lives. Therefore, all young people must work hard to establish a foundation for our academics and careers, exerting our lifelong energy to strive forward, still fearing that it will be insufficient, let alone wasting the golden age of youth? However, there are certainly young people who are aware, but there are also many who are not! For example, how many young people in the period of spring arousal indulge in self-gratification? Know that self-gratification is most likely to weaken the sexual nerves and loosen the sperm valves. Thus, semen, which is the source of our happiness and the element of life, in physiological terms, is the reproductive gland fluid. In addition to being stored in the seminal vesicles for the needs of love and reproductive functions, its endocrine hormones can directly seep into the blood, irrigating the whole body, and have functions such as regulating metabolism, promoting development, and nourishing nerves. Now, if nocturnal emission is prolonged and not treated, the reproductive gland fluid will inevitably be depleted, and conditions such as incomplete development, premature aging, impotence, brain degeneration, forgetfulness, neurasthenia, and fear of cold will follow one after another. Such young people will not only be sinners in male-female love, affecting fertility and losing happiness! At the same time, they will also miss the opportunity to study, and though they may reach adulthood, they will be old and declining, merely useless creatures in society!</p>
<p>The only remedy is to take "Hymettus Semen-Consolidating Tablets," which are most effective. This agent, as proven by world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, can consolidate the sperm valves and calm the nerves, effectively eliminating nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission causes the aforementioned symptoms, one must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain, increase essence and blood. Continued use will surely restore perfection in a short period. Patients can personally come to my clinic to receive electrotherapy and injections, which can guarantee a cure.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Hong Kong-Shanghai Transportation Difficulties Disrupt Continuous Shipments of Bureau Rice, Speculation Drives Vermicelli Prices Up</h3>
<p>Recent tensions in the Pacific, subtle adjustments to British and American commercial shipping, and the suspension of the Shanghai-Hong Kong route have left only the Shanghai Municipal Council's foreign rice still arriving via special vessels. The Panama-flagged "Moran Shun," managed by the Jardine Matheson's Foreign Department, arrived yesterday morning around 10:00 AM from Hong Kong, carrying 27,700 bags of foreign rice for the Shanghai Municipal Council, which were unloaded at the Roosevelt Wharf. This vessel will subsequently travel between Shanghai and Yangon, exclusively for rice transport. (Zu)</p>
<p>Both domestic and foreign rice are scarce, but transit goods continue to arrive in batches. The Du geng variety also arrives daily in quantities of 200-300 bags, while the customer xian variety arrives in quantities of 600-700 bags, none of which have been sold.</p>
<p>Vermicelli prices soared yesterday, driven by fears that the situation might disrupt supply. Dealers who had not stocked up were forced to inquire, while suppliers raised prices, causing the market to jump by 50 cents to over a dollar. Wholesale prices at Western godowns like the Fortress ranged from $43 to $43.50, and $44.80 at the banks. Jinlong brand was priced from $40.06 to $41, $42.50 at the silver godowns, and $42 at the Flower and Taikoo godowns. A total of nearly 5,000 bags were offered. Bran also saw inquiries from rural buyers, with daily bran prices rising by half a dollar to $54.50 for orchid customers at $51.50. No further transactions were reported.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil and Corn Prices Decline, Soybean Hoarding Drives Prices Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for miscellaneous grains saw both increases and decreases. Edible oil prices continued to fall by $5-$10 as actual sales were sluggish and hoarding intentions waned. Soybean prices, however, surged by $5-$6 due to perceived shortages resulting from scarce shipments. Corn prices initially hovered but then declined by $1-$2 as customer demand weakened. Wholesale transactions included ten barrels of Qingdao raw oil, over one hundred barrels of Dalian soybean oil, two hundred cans of Jiangbei raw oil, two hundred dan of Dayou factory refined oil, seven hundred dan of rapeseed oil, two hundred barrels of Rihua factory rapeseed oil, one hundred dan of Taishan factory rapeseed oil, over one thousand packages of Tianjin Xinjinyuan oil, three hundred packages of green beans, two hundred packages of Qingkou soybeans, one cart of Changzhou Niupi yellow beans, over five thousand packages of spot corn, and six hundred packages of futures.</p>
<h3>Mills and Hoarders Simultaneously Dump Stocks, Cotton Yarn Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak, with renewed declines in the afternoon. This is because current yarn sales are blocked, and mills need funds, so they sell off stocks in the Shuangma market. Speculators holding physical goods are also taking the same approach. Thus, the market is flooded with chips. Although bulls are struggling to maintain stability, the circumstances make it difficult to resist. As a result, the yarn market, which had been hovering for days, has collapsed again and is falling sharply. The high price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was $2,440, and the low price was $2,280.</p>
<p>The opening market for Jin Shuangma agricultural products was stable, with an initial price of $2,420, which briefly rose to $2,440. Later, the yarn and cloth market at the exchange was weak but rising, and sentiment remained stable, fluctuating around $2,420 for a considerable time. By the time of closing, the market had softened to $2,420. The morning half-day turnover was estimated at 2,550 bales. In the afternoon, news was unfavorable to the bulls, and the yarn and cloth market at the exchange experienced a similar collapse. The Shuangma mill's spot market followed suit, with selling pressure emerging. The opening price broke through the $2,400 mark to $2,390. After a slight consolidation, the market continued to fall to within $2,300, with a minimum price of $2,280. The closing price was $2,290.</p>
<p>The Jin Shuangma futures market went from slightly weak to violently declining, triggering a sharp sell-off. The volatile sentiment was hit by unfavorable news, causing a major commotion among the bulls and the efforts of speculators, resulting in a severe market downturn. At the opening this morning, although US cotton remained firm, the general buyers were reluctant due to unfavorable news. Furthermore, the active short-sellers caused the opening prices for all months to weaken. Later, with the gold market and spot yarn stagnant, the futures yarn also only fluctuated slightly, with fluctuations only hovering between $30 and $40. In the afternoon, rumors of poor news from abroad caused panic, with many bulls rushing to sell. The gold market and mill spots went straight down, and futures yarn followed suit, expanding the decline. The prices for the first two months' contracts closed at low prices, with the far-month contracts closing at $2,490, a decline of $120 to $150. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Month | December | January | February</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Opening | $2,475.0 | $2,545.0 | $2,591.0</p>
<p>Highest | $2,480.0 | $2,550.0 | $2,605.0</p>
<p>Lowest | $2,330.0 | $2,470.0 |</p>
<p>Closing | $2,330.0 | $2,420.0 | $2,490.0</p>
<p>Change | Down $150.0 | Down $130.0 | Down $30.0</p>
<p>Spot cotton: Because the yarn market collapsed, it became sluggish and lacked buyers. Therefore, it remains in a state of stagnation.</p>
<p>New York cotton market: Initially rose due to buying by dealers and speculators, as well as firm spot markets. Subsequently, some profit-taking and selling by Southern dealers caused a slight decline. As a result, closing prices were up approximately 6 to 16 points from the previous day. The Indian cotton market was closed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is predicted that the opening market today will continue to rise by about two rupees.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Plunge, Difficult for Piece Goods to Advance</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market trended weakly yesterday. Selling pressure increased, resulting in declines of $1 to $1.50 per piece for white goods, fabrics, and twills, and declines of $0.50 to $1 for coarse cloth. Bleached and dyed fabrics also fell by $1 to $2. Current sales remain sluggish. Approximately 200 pieces were sold in this street.</p>
<p>Due to the sharp drop in yarn prices, the market for Eastern cloth is soft. All cloths saw continued declines. The closing price for this month's colorful ball fine cloth futures at the exchange was $882.80, down $2.20. The opening price for the leading fine cloth mill spots in the spot market was down $1, with an afternoon closing price of $88.70. The market continued to fall by $2, with an evening price of $87.10. The Four Gentlemen (silk fabric) also closed down to $3.09.</p>
<h3>Flannel is Rare and Expensive</h3>
<p>High-priced flannel is also very difficult to obtain. Tianjin Renli Tianma image goods are out of stock, and empty plates are being offered for over $90 per yard. Imported goods are uncertain, making them more speculative than any other wool fabric. In recent days, top-quality English-made oblique-flower bottom flannel has averaged $85-$86, with ordinary versions selling for $80, and second-quality four-bottom versions selling for $70.</p>
<h3>Supply Exceeds Demand, Gold Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold black market saw another dramatic and wild decline, showing a tendency to collapse. Market prices broke through the $15,000 and $14,000 marks in succession. Sentiment weakened across the board. The Korean gang sold another 500 taels, securities firms cut positions by 400 taels, and cash firms and jewelers also eagerly sold. Although Tianyuan bought 540 taels, Xiangxingyong, Shihe, and the Hong Kong gang each bought around 300 taels, and money shops were also active buyers, supply still exceeded demand. Additionally, the sharp drop in Shuangma yarn to within $2,300 put pressure on the market. The price fell from a morning opening of $15,250 to a low of $13,650 before the evening close, a drop of $1,580. Total daily transactions amounted to 21,130 taels. Jewelry gold fell by $160, and standard silver was nominally unchanged but secretly declined.</p>
<p>A Decline of Over $1,500</p>
<p>The market opened this morning at $15,100 per bar (ten taels), down $180. Tianyuan, Gonghe, Xiangxing, and Yonglai aggressively bought, raising the price to $15,250. The Korean gang came to sell, and securities firms and Jinbang also sold. Mingda securities firms, Yongcheng, and Deda, Shihe aggressively sold, and Tongkang and Yong also sold. The market fell by 700 to $14,550. Xiangxingyong, Tianyuan, Yongcheng, and Tongkangyong bought, raising the market to $14,800. Yifeng unloaded, and the afternoon closing was $14,650. The market opened at $14,700 at 2:00 PM, up $50. Immediately, a downward trend began. Tianyuan, Shihe, Mingfeng, Gonghe, Shunyuan, Xianghe, Xiangxingyong, and securities firms all aggressively sold, and the market price fell further and further, plunging $1,050 to $13,650. The market closed at $13,700 at 4:00 PM, a sharp drop of $1,580 compared to the previous evening's close. There was a high-low range of $1,600 that day. The retail price of cash firms' base gold was $14,000, with buy-in prices approximately $1,000 lower than sell-out prices.</p>
<p>Jewelry Also Repeatedly Dropped Five Times</p>
<p>The price of jewelry gold per tael was reduced twice by fellow jewelers in the morning, down $60, and then reduced three times in the afternoon, down $100, to $1420 (buy-in reduced by $150), a total reduction of $160. Standard silver was still listed at $20 per tael, but the black market price was also weak at $15-$16.</p>
<h3>US Exchange Rate Softens Slightly on the Black Market, US Dollars Plunge Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the central and HSBC posted rates remain stable. HSBC and other small exchange rates also saw little change. The black market price for English gold remained stable, while the US exchange rate softened after initially opening higher. After the morning opening, a certain Chinese merchant speculator first sold over $1,000 USD at a price of $3.75, which was bought by a certain import company. It was heard that a certain Japanese broker bought approximately $3,000 USD on behalf of a Japanese trading company, also at a price of $3.75. Later, the price softened further to $3.625. The market situation became soft. The situation was stable in the afternoon, and no transactions were made. At the 4:00 PM closing, the selling price for the US exchange rate was 2.25, and the buying price was 2.1275. The buying price for US dollars was $3.50, and the selling price was $3.625. Compared to the previous day's closing, the English exchange rate was stable, while the US exchange rate tightened by $0.125.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw English and American gold pounds sharply decline by $30 along with the cash gold price. English gold notes remained stable, with market prices holding steady. US gold notes fell to $27.70, eventually reaching $28, a drop of $1.80. Hong Kong notes trended stably, with market prices holding steady. Japanese gold notes and military notes continued to weaken, with the former falling to $2.40 and the latter dropping to $3.10. Korean notes remained stable, with the evening market holding steady at the original price of $2.20.</p>
<h3>Domestic Bonds Remain Weak and Lifeless</h3>
<p>The black market for government bonds remained weak yesterday, with no signs of improvement. The trend has been downward, with many rumors circulating that are unfavorable to the bulls. Fortunately, short covering is preventing a dramatic collapse for now, but bullish investors are wary. This morning, buyers were not weak, with Dechang, Jiufeng, and Tongyi still hoping to raise prices and stimulate bullish interest. However, sentiment did not improve as a result. Datong, Shengxing, and Lianhe continued to sell off, causing C-type bonds to briefly fall below $8, but they failed to hold steady. In the afternoon, Shengxing continued to sell, and Tongkang also sold off, resulting in a weakening trend. The market's inability to rise was apparent, and it temporarily showed a weak and lifeless state. As a result, market prices continued to fall by $0.25 to $0.35 across the board. Transactions amounted to approximately 1.56 million yuan. A summary table is provided below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change</p>
<p>---------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | -------</p>
<p>Type A | $74.70 | $74.30 | $74.30 | Down $0.25</p>
<p>Type B | $70.00 | $69.55 | $69.55 | Down $0.35</p>
<p>Type C | $68.20 | $67.55 | $67.55 | Down $0.30</p>
<p>Type D | $64.80 | $64.25 | $64.25 | Down $0.30</p>
<p>Type E | $67.50 | $66.90 | $66.90 | Down $0.30</p>
<p>Stock Exchange: Fifty shares of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of $80. The previous high was $95.</p>
<p>The opening of the OTC market at the Public Trading Hall continued the previous day's decline. Subsequently, due to the weekend, many investors took profits, and various stocks fell sharply. Many industrial stocks reached new lows. However, soon after, due to the activities of real investors, the short sellers quickly covered their positions, and the market rebounded sharply. The morning's losses were almost completely recovered, and the closing trend was very strong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Futures Trading Completely Suspended, Sugar Prices Gradually Return to Normal</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the company's futures trading was completely suspended. The guild's market, the November import of 24th-grade coarse white spot sugar opened at $175. As rumors spread that the situation was easing, the market trended upwards, opening at $180 to $188 and $190, a difference of up to $15 on the day. The first offer in the afternoon was still $190 to $188. Unexpectedly, as scattered hoarders saw high prices, they seized the opportunity to sell, causing the price to fall back to $183, with a closing price of $179, only a $2 improvement over the previous market. October opened at $175, rising to $180, $185, and $187. The afternoon opening remained at $187, falling to $183, $180, and $177. September opened at $171.75, $175, and $178 in the morning, and $182 in the afternoon, falling to $174.72. August opened at $170, $175, and $177 in the morning, and $175 to $170 in the afternoon. Taikoo car white B mark was at $190, HX mark was at $181 to $183, and $185 in the afternoon, up $5. Hong Kong coarse opened at $165 to $170 to $175, and $174 to $172 in the afternoon, up $9 from the previous market. Dutch red opened at $166 in the morning, and $168 to $163 in the afternoon, up $8. Hong Kong red opened at $150 in the morning and rose to $169 in the afternoon, returning to a small amount of goods to $8,650. Total daily transactions were over 8,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Amidst Calls to Suppress Coal Prices, Coal Briquette Black Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>Coal briquette godown receipts: On Monday, due to the sharp fall in various goods, hoarders panicked and sought to sell. Guanghua, China, and other old receipts fell as low as $330, where some transactions occurred. In recent days, after merchants closed out of white coal, hoarders shifted their focus and absorbed coal briquette godown receipts, causing the black market to rise by over $20, similar to the open market. However, factory counterparts are still selling from their own vehicles at $354, trying to sell off current stocks to prevent hoarding, while retail prices at door shops are fixed at $19 per dan and have not changed.</p>
<h3>US Tinplate Prices are High</h3>
<p>The US tinplate market has been hot recently because overseas cargo has not been loaded for Shanghai. Can factories, kerosene can printing factories, and other users are buying in large quantities, leading to an enthusiastic market and strong sentiment. Asking prices are high. For example, 200-pound prime goods are being quoted at $1,400 per box, and 180-pound goods also require over $1,300. It is estimated that about 200 boxes were traded throughout the day. In addition, 200-pound old steel mill iron is also increasing its prices due to rising prime goods prices, with each box being quoted at $1,200, with new steel mill iron selling for $1,150, and narrow strip steel at around $1,000 per 200 pounds.</p>
<h3>Hunan Lotus Seeds Decline</h3>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds have recently seen weak sales, and prices are too high. As a result, prices are falling amidst the general price decline of goods, with prices declining by tens of dollars. For example, the market price for top-grade local Hunan lotus seeds yesterday was $530, a difference of over $100 from the highest price. Ordinary second-grade white lotus seeds have also fallen to $400. The market outlook is temporarily stable.</p>

<h3>Talking about Several Long-Lived Animals</h3>
<p>— Jiannong</p>
<p>The first question I want to raise for discussion is, can the lifespans of animals kept in zoos be taken as an "absolute standard" for the lifespan of that species? Zhuangzi didn't say, "Horses... eat grass and drink water, kick their hooves and leap about; this is the true nature of a horse. ... But then along came Bo Le, who said, 'I am good at managing horses!' He singed them, trimmed them, branded them, tied them up,... and the horses died off at a rate of twelve or thirteen in ten! ... He raced them, galloped them, harnessed them, lined them up, causing them to suffer the perils of ornamented yokes in front, and the misery of whips behind, so that the horses died off at a rate of more than half in ten!" The French naturalist Buffon was also very clear about this, so in his monumental work, "Natural History," he often expressed deep regret about a particular animal, saying, "If it is well cared for, it can live a long time, even in captivity; one should think that if it were in a free environment, its life would be even longer." Or he would say, "This animal, because it is far from its native land,... cannot develop to its natural length," and so on. Indeed, every time I visit the lion and tiger in the French park, and see them lying listlessly in their cramped iron cages, refusing even to open their eyes, I feel sorry for them and suffocated by the environment. Do you think they can live to the age they should in this environment? Enough of hearsay, let's look at some long-lived animals:</p>
<p>Elephant: Buffon himself said, "Several writers have written that elephants can live for four or five hundred years, others say three hundred years, and finally someone said one hundred and fifty years. I think the middle number is probably the truth, and people certainly know that captive elephants can live to be one hundred and twenty or one hundred and thirty years old, then those who are free... should at least live to be one hundred years old." The annotator of this natural history also extracted many other people's records and pointed out that elephants can live to be one hundred and fifty years old.</p>
<p>Fish: A Frenchman named B. Jacob, in his book "Fish at Home," recorded that Frederick Barbarossa, the famous German emperor who launched the Third Crusade, had a special interest in fish. He especially liked a magnificent fish called "Brochet," which he had carefully raised. One day, he had the whimsical idea of decorating his beloved "fish" with a copper ring with an inscription; this was done immediately, in the year 1230 AD. As time passed, the emperor died, and even this small gesture of bestowing fish faded from memory. But in the year 1497 AD, that is, after two hundred and sixty-seven years had passed, an anonymous German fisherman caught a large Brochet fish weighing three hundred and sixty kilograms in the river, and, to everyone's astonishment, the copper ring that the emperor had bestowed upon it was still perfectly intact!</p>
<p>Turtle: Is the Chinese saying of "turtle's age" baseless? Please look at the conclusions of the naturalist Thomson in "The Animal's Life Story" (a universal edition) after describing several large turtles: "Large turtles can live to be more than one hundred and fifty years old, and several we have talked about are several hundred years old. ... In 1766, five large turtles were transported from the Seychelles Islands to Mauritius - both islands in the Indian Ocean east of Africa. - One of them was still alive at the beginning of this century! In 1901, Dr. Kado reported: 'Although they are almost blind, they still maintain their usual habits and remain healthy. His shell is more than a yard long and can carry two people on his back!'"</p>

<h3>Marriage During Wartime</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>The uncertainty of the future does not seem to deter young people from getting married. According to reliable statistics, a total of 468,267 couples got married in Britain last year, which is close to 500,000. The number of marriages in 1939 was already quite high, but last year it increased by 18,000 couples. This seems to have broken all previous records in Britain. Judging from the current rate of increase, the total number for this year may far exceed that of last year.</p>
<p>This may be due to the wartime situation. All girls express unlimited admiration for soldiers. Therefore, as long as a man wears a uniform, Cupid's arrow will be shot at his chest. Furthermore, wartime marriages feel doubly exciting.</p>
<p>In any case, it is an undeniable fact that young men and women are filled with marriage fever, regardless of difficulties and an uncertain future.</p>
<p>According to British marriage registration, the marriage rate in the three years before the war was 17.4 per thousand. In other words, only seventeen and a half out of every thousand people got married. However, this rate has now increased to 22.6 per thousand. This year's rate may exceed 23 per thousand. Should this be attributed to Cupid, or to Hitler?</p>
<p>The most prosperous year for marriages during the First World War was 1915. At that time, the situation was also extremely unstable, and young couples did not seem to believe that a happy future awaited them.</p>
<p>The number of marriages increased sharply again in the year after the armistice agreement was established – a total of 369,411 couples – and a large number of divorce cases also occurred at the same time. This was the inevitable result of hasty marriages.</p>
<p>The number of marriages after the last war was far less than that of last year. How many men and women will get married after this war? Let us wait and see.</p>

<h3>Wartime Bible</h3>
<p>— Ling Pi</p>
<p>Oxford University Press in England recently published a "Wartime Bible." The scriptures remain unchanged, but the headings and illustrations have been modified to suit the current war. The illustration shows a page from "Isaiah," comparing Britain's preparations for war after the Munich Conference to the Jews' preparations to resist Assyria. This type of Bible is very capable of instilling wartime knowledge, and the American version will also be published soon. Let us wait and see.</p>

<h3>Hitler's Salary Increase</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhen</p>
<p>Amid the worldwide outcry over the high cost of living, the high standard of living in Germany, the head of the war, can be imagined. Germans have always been known for their hard work and endurance, and Hitler especially prides himself on his integrity, but this time he couldn't bear it any longer.</p>
<p>When Hitler felt that his expenses were not enough, he increased his living allowance. Senior government officials also benefited from this, with each person receiving an increase in their daily living allowance ranging from fifteen to eighteen marks, which is equivalent to six to seven dollars and twenty cents in pre-war U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>As for the total amount of Hitler's official salary, no one has ever really known. Although he does not have huge savings, his great work, Mein Kampf, has an exclusive sales right throughout the country, and he receives a large amount of royalties every year, which can be used to supplement his income.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fifteen: "Papa, let's go busking!"</p>
<p>"I only thought of this a few days ago. Only this kind of business, Papa, can we go out together, and we don't need to put up any signs. We won't tell anyone, and no one will know our background. Besides, this is the most free kind of business. If we're happy today, we'll sing more times. If we feel tired, we'll sing less times, or even not go out to sing." Mei Bao didn't explain what busking was all about first, but only told her father about the advantages she had discovered one by one.</p>
<p>"Well, what kind of way of selling is it after all?" Begonia heard these three advantages, and although she felt some excitement in her heart, before formally expressing her consent, she still felt that she must first ask clearly about the method of "selling."</p>
<p>"To explain this to you, I have to tell you about that Shandong family in number seventeen downstairs." As she spoke, she took the empty bowl from Begonia's hand and put it back on a small table against the wall, while she remained seated in her original chair.</p>
<p>"Is it the family with an old lady in her seventies?" Begonia asked uncertainly. Mei Bao nodded immediately. (281)</p>

<h3>The Importance of Children's Drama</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>"Jiliu" Drama Group's Children's Drama Department "The Ancient Temple Bell" Premieres Tomorrow</p>
<p>Children in schools acquire preliminary knowledge from subjects such as Mandarin, nature, common sense, and arithmetic. They also express their own strengths and emotions through music, physical education, and games. Those of us engaged in education often feel that we should use an activity—integrating various subjects in a connected way—to give children a more collective, lively, and socialized practice, and the most profound and effective educational impressions, which can only be achieved through the two methods of "educational film" and "children's drama." Unfortunately, very few of our Chinese films are educational films—this is because film merchants are not happy to invest capital in this type of film. Therefore, we must work even harder on the children's drama movement!</p>
<p>Children Need Drama</p>
<p>Although many elementary schools have children's drama groups, they only perform once during parent-teacher conferences. In this way, drama is merely an embellishment to education! —Note! Drama is by no means an embellishment or a pastime!</p>
<p>Really! Children not only love to watch plays, but also love to perform—during the New Year, don't we often see children with black or red masks on their faces, dancing and performing? They even hum tunes in their mouths!—If they cannot find this kind of spiritual food in the art of drama, they will go to various entertainment venues and street performers to learn those things with low tastes, or they will become good friends of the "Liangyou" pictorial. Ah! That is ugly and poisonous! Children's fragile hearts can easily be poisoned by this.</p>
<p>Bearing an Even Greater Mission</p>
<p>"Jiliu" is an amateur theater group with a fairly long history. It has had more than a dozen performances, and society has already seen its achievements. Not long ago, they established a children's drama department. "To undertake the great mission of the history of the children's drama movement" is the motivation for their establishment of this department. It is said that tomorrow they will perform the premiere of all-children heroes in the auditorium of the Gongbei Elementary School. The script is Xu Xingzhi's "The Ancient Temple Bell," directed by Jiang Shang. It is the best educational drama for children. Here, I wish them—the little heroes—success. At the same time, I hope that the theater community will pay more attention to children's drama, and that more and better children's drama groups will be organized and perform after "Jiliu"!</p>
<h3>Full-Length Cartoon "Queen Bee" to be Completed Within Six Months</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since the premiere of the Wan Brothers' full-length cartoon "Princess Iron Fan" in Shanghai, its box office has remained consistently strong. Therefore, they decided to continue their efforts and engage in the second full-length cartoon. However, the "Red Boy" story that was originally planned has been abandoned, and they will draw "Queen Bee," which was written by Zhou Yibai. This film depicts the life of insects and is scheduled to be completed within six months.</p>

<h3>Chinese Music Concert to be Held Tomorrow Evening at the YMCA</h3>
<p>The Yafeng Society, organized by amateur youths in Shanghai, aims to promote and improve national music. Since its establishment nearly two years ago, the society is about to hold a Chinese music concert at 8:00 p.m. on the 7th of this month in the auditorium of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge in order to promote national music. In addition to performing ancient and modern famous pieces, there will also be solo performances of the guqin and pipa by Professor Xian Zhongle, the society's consultant, a solo performance of the dongxiao by the famous musician Jin Zuli, and a solo performance of the erhu by Xu Guangyi. It is expected to cause a sensation in Shanghai at that time.</p>
<p>Brief News: Mr. Wen Lantting, the owner of Changchou Pharmaceutical Factory, has obtained the secret recipe of Mr. Xu Xiangbo and has been appraised by the famous doctor Ding Fubao. He will issue "Longevity Tablets," which are refined entirely by scientific methods. It will open soon, and people from the film and drama industries will broadcast advertisements on the radio. "Shanghai Cinema," a book that brings together 20 years of Shanghai film history materials, is sold by China Book Magazine Company. The special edition of "Film Fan Weekly" featuring the Top Ten Beauties of the film world will be reprinted today. It is exquisite and can be purchased at newsstands.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk, Nomad Cavalry, City Full of Dust</p>
<p>Hearing that Wu Sangui's army had reached Tongzhou, and the iron cavalry of the Qing army's Prince Ying Azig and Prince Yu Dodo had also arrived like a whirlwind, the capital was in danger. If he didn't leave soon, he would be besieged in the city and unable to return. Therefore, he decided to abandon the city and flee with blood. He ordered the large and small armies to sweep up the pearls, treasures, gold, silver, and wealth stored in the palace treasury and leave that day. He also hated Wu Sangui to the bone for borrowing Qing soldiers to defeat his own army, so he killed Wu Xiang and his family of more than thirty people. At this time, Wu Xiang regretted his surrender, but it was too late. Only Chen Yuanyuan was left by his side, unharmed. Yuanyuan heard that the Ming soldiers had won, the bandits had been defeated, and Wu Sangui's mighty army was pointing directly at the capital. Her heart was both happy and fearful. She was happy that the bandits would not be able to live in Kyoto sooner or later. As soon as her husband arrived here, he would definitely try his best to find her, and perhaps there would be a day when they could reunite. She was afraid that Li Chuang was cruel and murderous. If Sangui forced him too hard, he would know that she was the person Sangui loved most in his heart. If he took his anger out on her and killed her, then dying would be in vain. She had endured so many days of humiliation for what? It was only to one day be able to rekindle old affections with General Wu. When she was first captured, she had planned to die to repay General Wu, but in the end, dying in vain would be useless, and her heart was unwilling. She endured the great shame and secretly wiped away her tears, spending those tragic days. She had finally waited for this great opportunity, and how could she lose it? Therefore, she thought over and over again about how to deal with Li Zicheng so that she could turn misfortune into good fortune and turn danger into safety. (137)</p>
