<p>爲表示蘇聯的態度嚴正起見，莫斯科的無綫電宣傳引證如何共產制度已有改變，不再「拒絕上帝」，而法西斯和國社黨政府於一九三〇年所發起的壓迫行動，則尚繼續未已，並列舉各地的事實爲證。</p>
<p>蘇聯惰報部的首腦，於這種宜傳似有一審愼硏究的計劃，宣傳中的語氣隨時變動以適合各地的聽衆，自兩次虛驚至一九三九年戰事的實行爆發爲止，中間風雲變幻，已有不少事件早爲世人所遺忘，現在却在無綫電中重新宜揚出來。報告員對於每一類聽衆，皆能用適合的語調，以傳達他的意思。</p>
<p>如莫斯科向奧大利人提起他們從前的寺院，智識高超，物質豐富，現在非受毀壞，即被對閉，舊日修道之士，除三避難國外，什九皆被送入集中營去了。</p>
<p>意大利一向視羅馬敎皇和政府間的暗鬬爲疾首痛心之事，莫期科無綫電臺却從不肯放鬆一步，不時宜傳敎皇庇亞期十一世的斥責。莫期科一得消息，輒不問眞偽，一一廣播，而靜待奧情的反饗。</p>
<p>在這一方面法西斯的法里納西却供給了不少材料。他的反宗敎態度，就他在法哥斯黨報的反天主敎論文中可以看出，大足爲俄國宣傳之資。莫斯科廣播中每逢提起他的大著時常使無數意大利聽衆，奔走相告，翻閱原文，證實無綫當所言非妄，便心滿意足而去。</p>
<p>在西班牙，「法西斯」革命是假天主敎之名來號召的，莫斯科却找到了一位絕妙的西班牙人，在無綫實中說明天主敎和敎會於新政制下未得絲毫裨益。</p>
<p>這種宣傳早已深入了西班牙，試看下面一事，即可證實此說。</p>
<p>情於俄國的瑞士人，討論蘇聯轉向基督敎一事，否認牠是哀求乞憐的行爲，而請人追憶蘇維埃成立以前正統敎會在俄羅斯人生活中的重要關係</p>
<p>他們又說：「我們須記得組成共產黨團體的一百萬人，在俄國全體人民中僅佔一極小部份。我們亦應想到以前虔奉宗敎，信仰上帝的許多領袖，今日已公開取消其昔日的宜言，而蘇聯人民則依照一九三六年的憲法，有憑良心信仰或不信仰宗敎的自由，外間雖多誤解，終於事實具在，不能一筆抹殺，」</p>
<p>據蘇聯駐英大使伊文曼斯基最近宣言，俄國今日有三萬多個獨立的宗敎社會，並無國家支持，而能繼續行使牠們的職務，甚且十分興旺，這大概是基督敎在俄國人的神秘主義中根蒂已深，而並未消滅吧！（未完）</p>

<h3>各華商銀行　提存限制擬放寬　年終將屆抵押放款暫停中交兩行重新整理業務</h3>
<p>華商銀行存於匯豐麥加利等英美銀行之存款、自允許提款後、其辦法由匯豐銀行向正金銀行開戶、作爲往來、由華商銀行轉向正金銀行提取、昨據探悉、華商銀行將存於匯豐麥加利銀行存軟、開始向正金銀行辦理轉賬手續、一待辦竣、即可提取存款，故此事業已成熟、一俟實行後、華商銀行提軟限制、亦將擬議放寬、</p>
<p>外人提款改定限額</p>
<p>至外籍人士存於華商銀行之存款、前定爲每月得提取四千元、自即日起、則改定爲每月提取二千元、至華商銀行對華人之提款辦法、則照銀錢業聯席會議商定辦法辦理、並無變更、</p>
<p>錢業市塲更改時間</p>
<p>錢業市塲、以各銀行錢莊之營業時上午十時起、該市塲爲適應情形起見、亦應將開拆息時間改遲、昨出通告云、「逕啓者、查同業營業時間、已改爲上午十時起、本市塲開拆息時問、原定爲八時三刻、茲於本月廿二日起、暫定爲九時一刻、請查照爲荷、錢業市塲三十年十二月二十二日」、</p>
<p>押款貨物昨已彙報</p>
<p>銀錢業臨時聯台會、辦理各銀行錢莊押款貨物申報、其貨物品類特別注重於下列　五金、　橡皮、　汽車、　藥料、　染料、　油脂等六項、經以申報單分送各行莊塡報後、因昨日爲最後截止日期、臨時聯合會對於是項申報單之敦促微集、極形繁忙、迄昨日午後、業已　集集轉送、</p>
<p>抵押放款暫行停做</p>
<p>銀錢業復業以後、因市上頤寸緊縮、對於抵押放款、均已暫時停止、並因年終即屆、對於各種以前押款、亦紛紛催索歸還、如對於黃金·五金·糖·烟草·等押款、均相率　索歸還、故物價回低甚勁、</p>
<p>中交兩行昨停提存</p>
<p>本埠中國交通兩銀行、昨日停止收付款項、其停止提存之原因、則不詳、兩行八日後、一度停止營業、嗣後經允予維持本埠余融、提存亦以五百元爲限、聞此次停止提存、爲時甚暫、俟整理就緒即可重行准提、</p>

<h3>工部局核准　再減用電量　鑒於材料缺乏限量隨時變動</h3>
<p>工部局頃發布告第五六九一號、自即日起、再度限制用電分配量、分配與各類用戶之用電量、計已核定如下、</p>
<p>用戶類別　分配量</p>
<p>運輸及公用事業類　百分之七十</p>
<p>房屋及寓所類（冷氣設備除外）　百分之六十</p>
<p>工業類（衛生與食品以及主要服務除外）　百分之四十五</p>
<p>奢侈品類（包括冷氣設備在內）　百分之四十五</p>
<p>娛樂塲所類（冷氣設備除外）　百分之四十五</p>
<p>每月用電五百度以下之用戶　限用五百度</p>
<p>標準電量計算方式</p>
<p>附註、所謂分配量者、係指每一用戶之標準用電量之成數而言、所謂標準用電量者、係指每一用戶在上年一月份起至本年一月份止之用電期內任何一個月之最高用電總量而言、至於一千度以下之用戶、其最高用電量係根據上年十二月份起至本年十一月止之用電期叫定、</p>
<p>用電過額收費倍數</p>
<p>各用戶用電在分配量以內者、概照通常電價收費、超越限額之用電、當按下表收費、　超越分配量不過百分之五者、超越部份按平均電價三倍收費、　超越分配量在百分之五以上、但不過百分之十五者、出超部份之第一個百分之五按平均雷價三倍收費、其餘部份按六倍收費、　超越分配量在百分之十五以上者、出超部份之第一個百分之五按平均電價三倍收費、其次百分之十按六倍收費、其餘部份按五十倍收費、　任何用戶、在任何一個月內、超越分配量時、即使按照上開辦法付費、其超越部份、當在下月份之分配量內、照數扣除、倘業經扣除之分配量、叉復超出、當即停止供電、至特別委員會核准重接之時爲止、（附註）所謂超越之用電量、係指超越分配量之成數、而非指超越標準用電量之成數而言</p>
<p>起算日期</p>
<p>任何用戶、其標準用電量爲每月五百度或五百度以下、而在任何一個月內超過五百度者、其超過部份、當按上開收費辦法收費、此項修正限制用電收費率、當適用於自上海電力公司以書面通知用戶之日起算之用電期賬單、鑒於燃料之缺乏、用電之分配量得隨時修正、不先通知用戶、經修正之分配量、當自書面通知送達用戶之日起實施、在必要時、得於任何開賬期內訂定之、並自醫面通知送達用戶之日起實施</p>
<h3>熟水昨起漲價</h3>
<p>自太平洋戰專爆發後、煤斤運滬不無困難、煤業公會對於熟水店平煤尚未發售、各店轉輾購得高價之煤斤、以致成本加蠶，故自昨日（十二月廿二日）起、已自動加價、茲抄錄其通告如下、「自三十年十二月二十二日起、熱水暫售每　幣五分、水籌按照國幣計算、不得私自增减、特此通告、」兩租界內各熱水店、已於前日起一律按照新價發售矣、</p>
<h3>小額郵滙　已恢復兌付　十元以內爲限</h3>
<p>外埠滙滬匯票暫停兌付間題、所給與公衆之不便殊甚、昨據大通社記者向郵政儲余匯業局探悉、該局與上海郵政管理局商洽結果、已自昨日起、對二十元以下小額匯票、照常兌付、惟二十元以上匯票、則仍須暫延日期、再行商定兌付辦法、至活期儲金自規定最多祇能提取二十元以來、儲戶深以爲苦、此事現悉亦由儲匯局與郵政管理局商洽辦法、不久可望酌予增加提款限額、</p>
<h3>各種麵食店　希望繼續營業　如不請求接濟明年不予換照昨晨市民爭購麵包事屬無謂</h3>
<p>據工部局稱、凡向本局領照之另售商店·麵包店·切麵店·大餅店·以及其他麪粉大量用戶、不能獲致麵粉供給者、着於本月廿九日以前、向本局請求接濟麵粉、以維營業，其有需要麵粉而並不來局請求協助者、各該執照、自明年起、不予換發、茲有鄭重聲明者一點、即各粉棧之啟封、交涉進行順利、麵粉供給現可獲致、但其數量應受當局之限制耳、本局希望上述各業，能繼續營業、以以便公衆易於購得主要食品也、</p>
<p>寗式糕餅或將停售</p>
<p>兩租界當局對於麵包，餅乾等製造商、已有新指示、自今日起停止發售零星麵包及各種餅乾、糕果、以節省麵粉用途、惟悉家庭麵包仍照常製售、以應市民正當需要、父南北貨號經售之寗式糕餅、今日起或亦將中止發售、以期嗣後麵粉供應、可無匱乏之虞、</p>
<p>爭購麵包殊非必要</p>
<p>昨晨南京路與靜安寺路沙利文等數家大食品店前、集有大批中外市民、列行候購麵包、關於此事、工部局人員答覆記者時稱、其咎乃在公衆、蓋目下絕無列行候購麵包之必要也、日當局重啟麵粉堆棧後、上海麵包絕不匱乏、至於列行待購麵包之</p>
<p>唯一原因</p>
<p>厥爲市民親自或飭僕至少數大食品店、而不赴鄰近小食品店購取麵包、市民何以出此、殊難索解、大約市民誤認麵包缺乏、祇向大食品店始能全天購得所致、實則本市各處麵包均充、故請市民　助消弭事態、各赴最近店家購取麵包、而弗釀成不必要之爭購情形、同時、公共租界</p>
<p>米況如常</p>
<p>惟因汽油缺乏、改用手推車運米、未克儘速趕運米糧至各零售店、至於兩租界米店前、仍有列行候購者其主因厥爲許多小民購得足敷其立即需要之米後復返、以期多購、故工部局刻正硏究辨認購米之辦法、以防其購後再返、</p>
<h3>廠商減縮或停業　失業問題嚴重　各業互與日方討論辦法建議發給川資遣返故里</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本市華籍男女工業勞工、業已失業、或不久諒將失業者、或達數萬人、彼等之邊送返鄉事、乃上海日方與英美工業僱主刻正協力者慮之緊急的嚴重問題，</p>
<p>籌商辦法</p>
<p>本市日方商界已發起於過去數天內、召集日英美工業主速續舉行非正式會談、討論處理上海工業勞工情勢之法、前兩週來、上海工業勞工失業者、爲數頗夥、今當局雖盡力將失業勞工、减至絕對的最小限制、然許多工廠工作之續加减縮、乃莫可避免者、似勢必使此間失業工人增多、</p>
<p>遣返故里</p>
<p>新近失業之工人、均獲遣散費、目前尚不亟需援助、然彼等絕少在滬上其他工廠謀業之機會、故一旦現款用罄、恐將爲市民之重負、各種國籟之工業主、因乃贊成將失業勞工從滬遣返內地故里之意見、並建議行將解雇勞工者、應發給川資、以便成行、聞日當局對於失業勞工之遣返、將給予通行證、與准携個人物件等便利、</p>
<p>四大車行磋商遣散</p>
<p>四大出差汽車公司車夫一千六百餘人、因公司停業、要求發給遣散費、聞資方已允照給本月份薪金、再發賞金每人兩個月、並保留其職位、惟勞方仍堅欲資方發給賞金每人十二個月、並每月以三百元支付給汽車夫工會、目下談判仍在進行、但一般相信、解決之期、已不在遠矣、</p>
<p>各業工人紛紛解雇</p>
<p>武定路五五〇號中央機器鋼錠製造廠工人一百十人、因要求加薪未遂、於本月十六日起罷工、現聞資方已允加薪、故各工人、業已無條件復工、</p>
<p>馬勒輪船公司停業遣散員工後、碼頭工人七百餘、要求發給遣散費六個月、資方僅許以一星期之遣散費、以致雙方談判僵持、業已多日、現猶延未解決、綠實橘汁公司送貨工人十四名、因遭公司當局辭退、要求發給遣散費、嗣由資方發給每人五百元、工潮已解決、</p>
<p>東方運輸公司亦以停業造散問題、由勞資雙方舉行談判、現談判已結束、職工每人得賞金工資二個月、</p>

<p>請還尾找</p>
<p>過去工部局直接採辦之香港洋米、其繳款出貨手續、歸由英商立基祥茂　洋行辦理、當時爲迅速便利計、米款均付整數、擬定期發還尾找（多付之款）、此次各米號領售棧存洋米、亦採同樣辦法、聞兩起尾我總達法幣六十萬元左右、雖經公會函催、亦未發還、値茲銀根奇緊、周轉爲難、聞該業要求當局令飭該兩洋行尅日淸償、</p>

<h3>爲經濟食堂設計</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>因爲食米分配量的不暢，最近有幾家飯店已取消樓下堂座，只供應「上樓」顧客。因爲到樓上的顧客總得來幾斤酒，煮幾式菜，在低斟慢酌之後，就是再吃飯，其腸胃的容量也被酒菜佔去大半了。樓下堂座呢，那都是一碗荳腐湯或一碟黃荳芽送下三大碗飯的「老粗」，收入旣少，需米孔殷，無論在營業及供應上都打不出算盤，就不如吃「飯」莫入了。恰恰與「開了飯店不怕大肚皮」適得其反，然而窮人又偏偏都是大肚皮哩。</p>
<p>而且這種「上」不得「樓」的顧客及其家屬，（或者竟是光棍）又大都是因「爲吃飯而工作」而抽不出空去排隊，於是到了「人皆吃飯」的時候就徬徨於算算鈔票與摸摸肚皮的岐途了。</p>
<p>叫道些人怎樣辦呢？我因之覺得北四川路靑年會的學生經濟食堂實在是可以仿效或擴大的。</p>
<p>靑年會學生經濟食堂的辦法是道樣的：凡是學生可憑章購「入座券」一紙，憑劵領取盆碗筷一付，依先後自己到廚房領取飯菜。價格好像是八角。</p>
<p>就採照這種辦法在英法兩租界的適中地點各設立大食堂一所，如果有誠意來付諸實行，大概並不是一件困難的事。現暫擬就下列的幾個要點：</p>
<p>廚子應該錄取富於經騐的，因爲他們能够購取當天菜塲上最多而又最價賤的原料。烹調的技術自然也較高明。</p>
<p>飯券另售當然太麻煩，可釘本出售，一本爲五張或十張。</p>
<p>菜，飯盛於一器，旣省手續，亦可减少「敲碎飯碗」之虞。</p>
<p>食堂內設侍役數名（視情形而定），專收拾飯器。洗滌的工作自然也當有專員數人擔任之。</p>
<p>食者務必嚴守秩序。</p>
<p>應市時間，應在上午十一時至下午一時，及下午五時至七時兩個規定時間內。</p>
<p>至於食米的供給，可由負責者向兩租界當局請求，或者竟是請求當局協助。</p>
<p>除一切必要開支外，利潤不得超過一分，而且這一分錢亦應公積起來，以備不時之需（如添購器皿等）。</p>
<p>當然這不是「做生意」，且較「做生意」應該更認眞擲重。希望有心人挺身而出來做做這也可算做慈着機關的專業吧。</p>
<h3>興趣</h3>
<p>— 章格</p>
<p>凡人就其性之所近，各有其興趣。喜歡賭博，是一種興趣，喜歡玩女人，亦是一種興趣；專心事業，是一種興趣，專心學問，更是一種興趣。沒有興趣的人，不論對何事，都會素然無味；一有興趣，則精神百倍。</p>
<p>但興趣的解釋決不如此簡單，梁任公先生嘗說：若把他本人加以解剖，與趣而外，別無長物。他所謂一身所粹的興趣，並不是一般的興趣，而專指他對研求學問，永小自滿，永無止境，且永有興趣。道才是眞正的興趣。</p>
<p>玩物喪志，我們不一定認爲至理名言，但拿賭博和玩女人的興趣與求學問的興趣相較，其相去簡直不能計算。過去和現在，一般人的興趣就集中在賭博和玩女人上面，已在社會上做事的有此現象，即尚在讀書時期的學生何嘗不是如此。舉一個明喧的例：從前北四川路的舞塲，以來自江灣的大舉生爲舞客的大多；，而最近總理誕辰紀念的例假日，就也有數十大學生聚賭被捕，判處罰余的新聞。舉生對讀書沒有興趣，而走着相反的路，這種精神到底是要不得的。</p>
<p>我們應如何自勉，在事業上，學問上多多增加與趣。</p>
<h3>買米歸來</h3>
<p>— 董志</p>
<p>近日讀書，頗得養心之樂，　中米僅存數升，幾與韓樂吾有同感，但排隊買米終亦無着。歸來讀列子至力命篇「魏人東門吳子死而不憂，其相室曰：公子愛子，天下無有，今子死不憂何也？東門吳曰：吾常無子，無子之時不憂，今子死乃與嚮無子同，臣奚憂焉？勢使然也，命使然也」一節，恍然自慰於我常無米，無米之時不憂，今購米無着，乃與嚮無米同，我奚憂焉！旣而自思，售米盡人事也，買米而擠不上却天命也，不能因擠不上去而不買，是盡人事以待天命也。</p>
<h3>聖誕節與湊熱鬧</h3>
<p>— 土土</p>
<p>聖誕節的前夜，母親們悄悄地把糖菓玩具滿塞在一隻新的襪子裏，孩子久晨醒來時，驚異地接受這禮物，還以爲是白鬚的聖誕老人乘他睡熟時所送來，小心靈中認爲這是一種奇蹟，佳節方過，便又天天盼望再臨的日子。往年聖誕節之夜的類似瘋狂的熱鬧，不知要使多少靑年男女任事後然烈追憶，而企待着明年，靑年人的恣意尋歡與兒實的希望得到聖誕禮物，可說是相同的憧憬。</p>
<p>就我所經歷的聖誕節而言，一年一度的燦爛點綴完全是許多愛湊熱閙的人所湊成，他們像是此生專爲歡娛而來，尤其是靑年表現得最眞切，自然他們倒不一定是基督的兒女。</p>
<p>往年在這幾天早　滿目是聖誕將到的氣象，愛湊熱鬧的人都已在作狂歡的準備，今年是一望蕭索，滿目凄凉，　了偶然還有幾處陳列窗內站着聖誕老人和稀落的冬節禮品市招外，幾乎令人忘却佳節就在眼前。湊熱鬧者的人數　疑地會銳减，他們中的大部份已掙扎在米煤的鎖鍊中，歡娛到底不能當飯吃，預計今年的聖誕節一定應景乏人，祇好讓聖誕老人白瞪着眼嘆氣連聲了。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦廋鷗</p>
<p>十五　爸爸，賣唱去吧！</p>
<p>梅寳除了竭力給他　解以外，自己也總是分外的謹愼，無論什麼日子，總不穿鮮艷的衣服，外面永遠罩一件藍布單褂；粉和胭脂已從她開始出去賣唱的一天起，跟她完全絕緣了。在客人面前唱戲的時候，雖然並不把臉扳得像跟人家生氣一樣，但也決不輕易嬉笑，客人問什麼話，總讓韓家的那個姑娘去應付，她只是靜靜地站在一邊。</p>
<p>「那個高的一個女孩子長得眞好看，可惜不肯說話，像個泥美人一樣。」因爲梅寳不開口，客人便往往這樣議論着。</p>
<p>聽在秋海棠的耳朶裹，當然覺得非常可惱，其實像這樣文文靜靜的說幾句話，打趣的範圍，僅僅以品頭評足爲限，還算是好客人咧！有的簡直把她們當妓女看，拉手的拉手，灌酒的灌酒，要不是每次都虧韓家父女挺在頭裏，秋海堂準會每天跟人家打架，而他們所湊的幾個錢也祇够買些橡皮膏和藥水棉花用了！</p>

<h3>談「家庭娛樂」　黃連樹下彈琴</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>近五年以來，筆者從未踏進電影院一次，因爲生活艱苦，情緒不佳，經濟來路不易，還有什麽心緒去娛樂？自從一二，八太平洋戰事爆發，生活的艱苦，經濟的困窘，是更甚於前了！這樣愁悶乏味，在精神上說：，終究是一大損失！然則怎樣調劑呢？看平劇？看電影？在經濟上均非所許，「黃速樹下彈琴」，我以爲只有實踐「家庭娛樂」的一法。所謂「家庭娛樂」，如利用口琴，風琴的吹·彈；如圍棋，象棋的對着；如團聚家人講故事；如硏究書，畫，金，石；品茗座談，猜拳行令，或每天來一次「衛生麻將」（圈數宜少）亦無不可。惟一的消遣目的，是滌除俗慮和身心的煩悶，在這動盪愈烈的大時代，節約一文是文，少用一錢是一錢，物質娛樂的享受儘管苦，而精神方面，却不可不特別設法調劑，質之讀者，以爲何如？</p>

<h3>血雨瓊葩</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第二十章　蠟炷迎來在戰塲</p>
<p>到了明天，淸軍發覺了這事，拘捕鄰近人民，詢問兇手，一些得不到端倪。攝政王　爲樹上有了字跡，以爲玷辱了淸軍，勃然大怒。一邊嚴責部下加緊緝拿，訓飭所部遵守紀律，無故不得離營。把樹上的人頭，河中的浮屍，收拾掩埋。苦不知有誰做下這事，故意尋淸　的釁隙，所以刺字於樹，梟首於技。且以爲這件事非能人不辦，因爲那人頭掛得很高，取下也不容易呢。疑心吳三桂部下的明將或有暗和淸兵作對，以至於此。遂通知吳三桂，敎他嚴詰部下，不得尋仇。吳三桂當然遵命，發了一道誥誡令。可是他的心裏始終戀戀於圓圓身上，因爲找不到圓圓，說不出的異常煩悶，便在攝政王面前目告奮勇，要追擒李闖。攝政王也因渠魁尚未伏誅，亟待用兵，所以商議之下，分兵兩路追剿流寇。英王阿濟格，豫王多鐸，率淸兵爲左翼。吳三桂率明兵爲右翼。明兵看到命令，只得開拔。張蒼虬等各人心裏便有些不滿，以爲明兵借了淸軍，擊敗流寇，克復了燕京，自當安撫民衆，亟立明裔，早定大計爲是。流寇雖然應該追剿，可是彼此比較起來，還是讓流寇苟延殘喘的關係較小了。現在吳三桂所以必要窮追，也就是爲了他愛姬陳圓圓，誓砍奪回，不肯放鬆，可見將軍的心埋只在　人身上而不在君國大計了。　（二四六）</p>
<h3>戲校造就的人材（下）</h3>
<p>— 言希</p>
<p>（丙）凈　周正禮—現在　錘人才，眞是鳳毛鱗角，他能有如此的成績，眞是件可喜的事。工架老練，我聽他的戲最使我滿足的，是牧虎關，空城計之司馬懿，及黃金台。</p>
<p>王正森—年紀大概很小吧！嗓子好像很嫩，可是非常動聽，尤以道白爲最。他的主演戲很少，記得大鬧靑州之李逵，很是不錯。</p>
<p>王正鵬—嗓子不錯，戲太少了！</p>
<p>（丁）丑　邢正浩—小花臉頂難唱做，尤其是小孩子來唱更難，如果唱丑的是一個很小很小的孩子，因爲人小，所以容易引人發笑，像他則不然，在戲校中比他小的人很多，如孫正陽，王正廉都唱小花臉，而不以爲他是最好的一個，雖然戲少得可憐，可是請看烏盆計之張別古，盤關之守門官，口齒多麼的淸晰，身段多麽的美麗，而劇校有許多小花臉戲都護給孫正陽了，對於他眞可惜，希望戲校不要埋沒了一顆明亮的星。</p>
<p>孫正陽—其實他也不錯，因爲生得小，所以容易引人注意　笑。他有時說白像背書，毫無語氣，臉上少表情，他的拿手戲是法門寺之賈桂，女起解之崇公道。</p>
<p>武生　景正飛—身上乾凈，身輕如燕，頭上留了一條小辮子，最令人注意，逢到他表演時總得到滿堂的彩聲。</p>
<p>其他好人才很不少，如鄭正學，陸正梅，彭正齡，王正康，周正雯　都很好。因爲給我的印象比較淺，所以不一的寫了。以上完全是我個人的意見，當然仁者見仁，智者見智，不可一概而論了。</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 21st – Führer Hitler issued a letter to all soldiers and members of the National Socialist Storm Troopers tonight. The letter stated: "Soldiers and Storm Troopers! This war is being fought for the freedom of our people and for the security of our future living conditions. Those who represent the interests of Jewish capitalism, every twenty or twenty-five years, under the guise of trivial pretexts, inflict war upon us. We must find a way to eliminate this scourge so that it never happens again. This war is being fought for this purpose. Fortunately, the war is nearing a decisive stage. Since Japan's participation in the war, Germany, Italy, and their allies have gained a new ally, which is very fortunate. Certain countries, using the same pretexts, even said that Japan must be destroyed, but the Japanese army, with lightning action, destroyed the US Pacific Fleet and the British army in Singapore and occupied the bases of Britain and the United States in the Far East, bringing the current war into a favorable stage. Our army is fighting on the Eastern Front, attacking the most dangerous enemy, and has also achieved indelible victories, rarely seen in world history. However, with the sudden arrival of the harsh winter, we must establish solid positions on the front lines to defend them and wait until next spring to make other plans. All the land occupied by our great sacrifices must be firmly defended and never easily abandoned. For this, I appeal to the soldiers on the Eastern Front. All German soldiers must work hard and strive as the German army did in Russia four winters ago, setting an example for all allied countries. Not only that, we should train new armies and manufacture new and sophisticated weapons, as we did last winter. As for the Western Front defenses, they have been strengthened from Kogenis Port in Norway in the north to the Spanish border in the south. However, this defense line has actually spread throughout the entire continent, even reaching North Africa. We must find a way to overcome all the difficulties we encounter, but this depends on vigorous action, not missing the time. We must carry out all preparations so that we can launch a major counteroffensive next spring until the enemies in Eastern Europe are completely eliminated. For this reason, we are now taking several military measures, but this work requires the army and the people in the rear to work together to make great efforts before it can be effective. Our country's main combat power depends on the army. Therefore, I have decided, in addition to being the Grand Marshal of the three services of the sea, land, and air, to also serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army. Soldiers, in the last World War, I participated as an ordinary soldier, fought in many battles, and was wounded six times. Once, I almost became blind. Therefore, I am also well aware of the difficulties you are encountering today. Moreover, after the end of the last World War, I never doubted that our country would be able to revive, and I still fought resolutely as an ordinary soldier. Finally, I was able to unite the German nation. The result of fifteen years of continuous efforts finally freed Germany from the shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. In short, I am always thinking of you. My ambition and work are solely to serve the people and make our country the greatest nation, which you must know. You must also know that I want to destroy the enemy and achieve victory. From now on, I will do my best in all matters relating to commanding the military and looking forward to the overall situation. All that is expected of you is to faithfully obey orders and follow me in striving until Greater Germany and the German people are finally liberated. God will not fail to grant victory to the bravest."</p>

<p>London, 22nd – The King has appointed four leading Labour Party figures as members of the House of Lords.

The authorities' action is not due to the nature of these individuals' achievements, but as a government policy to strengthen the Labour Party's position in the House of Lords. The current government is a mixed coalition of the Conservative, Labour, and Liberal parties, but in reality, the Labour Party's strength in the House of Lords is still insufficient.</p>

<p>Special Manuscript of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Christianity</h3>
<p>To express the solemn attitude of the Soviet Union, Moscow's wireless propaganda cites how the communist system has changed, no longer "rejecting God," while the oppressive actions initiated by the fascist and National Socialist governments in 1930 continue unabated, citing facts from various places as evidence.</p>
<p>The head of the Soviet intelligence department seems to have a well-considered plan for this kind of propaganda. The tone of the propaganda changes at any time to suit the audience in different places. From the two false alarms to the actual outbreak of the war in 1939, many events have been forgotten by the world, but now they are being re-propagated on the radio. The reporters can use a suitable tone to convey their meaning to each type of audience.</p>
<p>For example, Moscow reminded the Austrians of their former monasteries, which were highly knowledgeable and materially rich, but are now either destroyed or closed. Most of the monks of the past, except for those who sought refuge in foreign countries, have been sent to concentration camps.</p>
<p>Italy has always regarded the secret struggle between the Pope and the government as a painful matter. However, the Moscow Radio Station never let go, constantly propagating the rebuke of Pope Pius XI. As soon as Moscow received the news, it broadcast it all, regardless of its truth or falsehood, and waited for Austria's response.</p>
<p>In this respect, the fascist Farinacci provided a lot of material. His anti-religious attitude can be seen in his anti-Catholic articles in the fascist party newspaper, which is a great asset for Russian propaganda. When Moscow Radio mentions his great works, it often causes countless Italian listeners to run around and tell each other, flipping through the original text to verify that what the radio station said is not false, and then they leave satisfied.</p>
<p>In Spain, the "fascist" revolution is calling for support in the name of Catholicism. However, Moscow found an excellent Spaniard who said on the radio that Catholicism and the church have not benefited in the slightest under the new regime.</p>
<p>This kind of propaganda has already penetrated Spain. The following incident can prove this point.</p>
<p>A Swiss person who is sympathetic to Russia, when discussing the Soviet Union's turn to Christianity, denies that it is an act of begging for mercy, and asks people to recall the important relationship of the Orthodox Church in the lives of Russians before the establishment of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>They also said: "We must remember that the one million people who make up the Communist Party only account for a very small part of the entire Russian people. We should also think that many leaders who were formerly devoutly religious and believed in God have now publicly canceled their previous statements, and the Soviet people, according to the 1936 constitution, have the freedom to believe or not believe in religion according to their conscience. Although there are many misunderstandings outside, the facts are finally there and cannot be erased with one stroke."</p>
<p>According to a recent statement by Ivan Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to Britain, there are now more than 30,000 independent religious societies in Russia, which are not supported by the state, but can continue to perform their duties and are even very prosperous. This is probably because Christianity has deep roots in the mysticism of the Russian people and has not been eliminated! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Chinese Banks to Ease Withdrawal Restrictions; Mortgage Lending Temporarily Suspended as Year-End Approaches; Bank of China and Bank of Communications Reorganizing Operations</h3>
<p>The deposits of Chinese banks in British and American banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered have been allowed to be withdrawn. The method is that HSBC opens an account with Yokohama Specie Bank for transactions, and the Chinese banks transfer to Yokohama Specie Bank for withdrawal. According to sources yesterday, the Chinese banks will transfer the deposits in HSBC and Standard Chartered to Yokohama Specie Bank. Once completed, the deposits can be withdrawn. Therefore, this matter has matured, and once implemented, the withdrawal restrictions of Chinese banks will also be considered for easing.</p>
<p>Foreigners' Withdrawal Quota Revised</p>
<p>As for the deposits of foreigners in Chinese banks, the previous limit was 4,000 yuan per month. From today, it will be revised to 2,000 yuan per month. The withdrawal method for Chinese people in Chinese banks will be handled according to the method agreed upon by the joint conference of the banking industry, without any changes.</p>
<p>Change in Time for Money Market</p>

Yesterday, a notice was issued saying, "We hereby inform you that the business hours of the industry have been changed to start at 10:00 am. The original opening and closing time of this market was set at 8:45 am. Now, from the 22nd of this month, it will be temporarily set at 9:15 am. Please check.

<p>Pledged Goods Reported Yesterday</p>

The Provisional Joint Council was extremely busy urging the collection of these reporting forms. By yesterday afternoon, they had all been collected and forwarded.</p>
<p>Mortgage Loans Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Since the resumption of business in the banking industry, due to the tight money market, mortgage loans have been temporarily suspended. As the end of the year is approaching, various previous pledged loans are also being urged for repayment. For example, loans secured by gold, metals, sugar, and tobacco are being urged for repayment, so commodity prices have fallen sharply.</p>
<p>Bank of China and Bank of Communications Stopped Deposits and Withdrawals Yesterday</p>
<p>The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in this city stopped receiving and paying items yesterday. The reason for the suspension of deposits and withdrawals is unknown.

It is said that this suspension of deposits and withdrawals is temporary, and withdrawals will be allowed again after the reorganization is completed.</p>

<p>If the gasoline is supplied by the car owner, add 20 yuan per day.</p>
<h3>Finnish Ship Sails to Tianjin Today</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the shipping routes between this city and the foreign oceans, except for the Sino-Japanese liaison line operated by Japanese ships, the Sino-American, Sino-European, Nanyang, and Java lines have all been suspended. Even the South China line along the Chinese coast has been cut off. However, after the suspension of the Northern European, British, and American merchant ships, the Japanese ships Dalian Maru and Qingdao Maru are still sailing to Qingdao, Dalian and other ports. The Northern European and Northern Kang ships have not been suspended. Yesterday morning, two ships went to Tianjin from, and it was also heard that the Finnish merchant ship Tilda is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tianjin today, also stopping at Qingdao and Yantai.

<h3>Hand Grenades Found on Avenue Joffre</h3>

<h3>Doctors Who Do Not Need to Ride in Cars; Driving Permits Revoked</h3>

<h3>Public Works Department Approves Further Reduction in Electricity Consumption; Limited Quantity Changes at Any Time Due to Lack of Materials</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department has recently issued Announcement No. 5691, which will further restrict electricity allocation from today. The amount of electricity allocated to various types of users has been approved as follows:</p>
<p>User Category Allocation</p>
<p>Transportation and Public Utilities 70%</p>
<p>Houses and Residences (excluding air conditioning) 60%</p>
<p>Industrial (excluding hygiene, food, and essential services) 45%</p>
<p>Luxury Goods (including air conditioning) 45%</p>
<p>Entertainment Venues (excluding air conditioning) 45%</p>
<p>Users with monthly consumption below 500 kWh Limited to 500 kWh</p>
<p>Standard Electricity Calculation Method</p>
<p>Note: The so-called allocation refers to the percentage of each user's standard electricity consumption. The so-called standard electricity consumption refers to the highest total electricity consumption in any month during the electricity consumption period from January of last year to January of this year. For users with less than 1,000 kWh, their highest electricity consumption is determined based on the electricity consumption period from December of last year to November of this year.</p>
<p>Multiple of Fees for Exceeding Electricity Consumption</p>
<p>Users whose electricity consumption is within the allocation will be charged according to the usual electricity price. Electricity exceeding the limit will be charged according to the following table: If the excess over the allocation does not exceed 5%, the excess portion will be charged three times the average electricity price. If the excess over the allocation is more than 5% but not more than 15%, the first 5% of the excess portion will be charged three times the average electricity price, and the remaining portion will be charged six times. If the excess over the allocation is more than 15%, the first 5% of the excess portion will be charged three times the average electricity price, the next 10% will be charged six times, and the remaining portion will be charged 50 times. If any user exceeds the allocation in any month, even if they pay according to the above method, the exceeded portion will be deducted from the allocation in the following month. If the allocation that has been deducted is exceeded again, the electricity supply will be stopped immediately until the Special Committee approves reconnection. (Note) The so-called excess electricity consumption refers to the percentage by which the allocation is exceeded, not the percentage by which the standard electricity consumption is exceeded.</p>
<p>Starting Date</p>
<p>Any user whose standard electricity consumption is 500 kWh or less per month, and who exceeds 500 kWh in any month, will be charged according to the above charging method for the exceeded portion. This revised electricity consumption restriction rate will apply to bills for the electricity consumption period starting from the date the Shanghai Electric Power Company notifies the user in writing. Given the lack of fuel, the allocation of electricity may be revised at any time without prior notice to the user. The revised allocation will be implemented from the date the written notice is delivered to the user, and may be determined during any billing period when necessary, and will be implemented from the date the written notice is delivered to the user.</p>
<h3>Boiled Water Price Increased Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the transportation of coal to Shanghai has not been without difficulties. The Coal Industry Association has not yet sold flat coal to boiled water shops. Various shops have purchased high-priced coal through various channels, resulting in increased costs. Therefore, from yesterday (December 22), the price has been automatically increased. The notification is copied as follows: "From December 22nd, Year 30, hot water will be temporarily sold for 5 national currency cents per bucket. Water tickets will be calculated according to the national currency and may not be increased or decreased privately. This is hereby notified." All hot water shops in the two concessions have been selling at the new price since the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Small Postal Money Orders Have Resumed Payment; Limited to 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>The issue of the suspension of payment of money orders from other places to Shanghai has caused great inconvenience to the public. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, after consultation between the bureau and the Shanghai Postal Administration, it has been decided that small money orders under 20 yuan will be paid as usual from yesterday. However, money orders above 20 yuan will still have to be postponed and the payment method will be agreed upon later. Since the current savings deposit stipulates that a maximum of only 20 yuan can be withdrawn, depositors have complained bitterly. It is now learned that the Savings and Remittance Bureau is also consulting with the Postal Administration on a method, and it is expected that the withdrawal limit will be appropriately increased soon.</p>
<h3>Various Noodle Shops Hope to Continue Operating; Will Not Renew Licenses Next Year if No Request for Assistance is Made; The Public's Rush to Buy Bread Yesterday Was Unnecessary</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department, all retail stores, bakeries, noodle shops, sesame cake shops, and other large users of flour that have obtained licenses from the Bureau and cannot obtain a supply of flour should request assistance from the Bureau before the 29th of this month to maintain their business. If flour is needed but no request for assistance is made to the Bureau, the licenses will not be renewed from next year. One point that needs to be solemnly declared is that the unsealing of various flour godowns is progressing smoothly, and a supply of flour can now be obtained, but the quantity will be subject to the authorities' restrictions. The Bureau hopes that the above-mentioned industries can continue to operate so that the public can easily purchase essential foods.</p>
<p>Ningbo-Style Pastries May Be Discontinued</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have new instructions for manufacturers of bread, biscuits, etc.: from today, stop selling retail bread and various biscuits and pastries to save flour. However, it is learned that family bread will still be produced and sold as usual to meet the public's legitimate needs. Ningbo-style pastries sold by North-South Goods Stores may also be discontinued from today in order to ensure that there will be no shortage of flour supply in the future.</p>
<p>Unnecessary to Rush to Buy Bread</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a large number of Chinese and foreign citizens gathered in front of several large food stores such as Sullivan on Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road, waiting in line to buy bread. When a staff member of the Public Works Department replied to the reporter about this matter, he said that the blame lies with the public, as there is absolutely no need to wait in line to buy bread. After the Japanese authorities reopened the flour warehouses, there is absolutely no shortage of bread in Shanghai. The only reason for waiting in line to buy bread is that citizens personally or ordered servants to go to a few large food stores instead of going to nearby small food stores to buy bread. It is difficult to understand why citizens do this. It is probably because citizens mistakenly believe that there is a shortage of bread and that only large food stores can be sure to buy it all day long. In fact, bread is abundant everywhere in the city, so please help to eliminate the situation by going to the nearest store to buy bread and not creating unnecessary rush buying. At the same time, the rice situation in the Public Concession is normal, but due to the lack of gasoline, handcarts are used to transport rice, which cannot speed up the transportation of rice to various retail stores. As for those who are still waiting in line in front of rice shops in the two concessions, the main reason is that many small people return after buying enough rice for their immediate needs in order to buy more. Therefore, the Public Works Department is studying methods to identify rice buyers to prevent them from returning after buying.</p>
<h3>Factories Reduce or Shut Down; Serious Unemployment Problem; Various Industries Discuss Methods with the Japanese Side; Suggest Issuing Travel Expenses to Send People Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Evening News" reported that tens of thousands of Chinese male and female industrial workers in this city have already lost their jobs or are expected to lose them soon. Sending them back to their hometowns is an urgent and serious problem that the Japanese side in Shanghai and the British and American industrial employers are now working together to consider.</p>
<p>Discussing Methods</p>
<p>The Japanese business community in this city has initiated the convening of informal talks with British and American industrial owners in the past few days to discuss ways to deal with the situation of industrial workers in Shanghai. In the past two weeks, the number of unemployed industrial workers in Shanghai has been quite large. Although the authorities are doing their best to reduce the number of unemployed workers to an absolute minimum, the continued reduction of work in many factories is unavoidable, which seems bound to increase the number of unemployed workers here.</p>
<p>Returning to Hometowns</p>
<p>The newly unemployed workers have all received severance pay and do not need assistance at present. However, they have very few opportunities to find jobs in other factories in Shanghai, so once the current funds are used up, they may become a heavy burden on the city's residents. Industrial owners of various nationalities agree with the idea of sending the unemployed workers from Shanghai back to their hometowns in the interior and suggest that those who are about to be laid off should be given travel expenses to enable them to travel. It is heard that the Japanese authorities will provide facilities such as permits for the repatriation of unemployed workers and permission to carry personal belongings.</p>
<p>Four Major Car Companies Negotiate Dismissal</p>
<p>More than 1,600 drivers of the four major taxi companies are demanding severance pay due to the closure of the companies. It is heard that the capital side has agreed to pay this month's salary and a bonus of two months' salary per person, and retain their positions. However, the labor side insists that the capital side pay a bonus of twelve months' salary per person and pay 300 yuan per month to the taxi drivers' union. Negotiations are still in progress, but it is generally believed that a resolution is not far away.</p>
<p>Workers in Various Industries Dismissed One After Another</p>
<p>One hundred and ten workers at the Central Machine Steel Ingot Factory at 550 Wuding Road went on strike from the 16th of this month because their request for a pay raise was not granted. It is now heard that the capital side has agreed to raise wages, so the workers have unconditionally resumed work.</p>
<p>After the closure of the Moller Steamship Company and the dismissal of its employees, more than 700 dockworkers demanded six months' severance pay. The capital side only offered one week's severance pay, resulting in a stalemate in negotiations that has lasted for many days and has not yet been resolved. Fourteen delivery workers at Green Spot Orange Juice Company were fired by the company and demanded severance pay. The capital side paid 500 yuan per person, and the labor dispute has been resolved.</p>
<p>The Oriental Transportation Company is also holding negotiations between labor and management on the issue of closure and dismissal. The negotiations have now ended, and each employee will receive a bonus of two months' salary.</p>
<h3>Thaikong Company Bread Van Robbed</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 pm yesterday, a Thaikong Food Company cargo tricycle, fully loaded with bread to be delivered somewhere, was passing near Hankou Road and Fujian Road when it was suddenly attacked by a number of beggars who rushed forward when the car stopped and devoured all the bread in the car in an instant before fleeing. It is said that street food vendors and food delivery people have recently been at risk of being robbed.</p>
<h3>French Concession Authorities Prohibit Gift Giving</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the winter solstice and New Year are approaching, residents in the concession often prepare gifts for the public officials of the Consulate, the Public Works Department, and the Police Station to cultivate relationships. The French Consul General in this city, M. Magre, recently reiterated the prohibition, citing French laws, and advised all sectors not to take unnecessary actions.</p>
<h3>The Woman Who Committed Suicide in the All Star Hotel is the Daughter-in-Law of a Wealthy Merchant; The Body Has Been Claimed by Family Members</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 am the day before yesterday (the 20th), a middle-aged woman suddenly jumped from the window of the seventh floor of the All Star Hotel on Jiangxi Road, falling to the ground. She was seriously injured at the time and was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by police officers. It is now learned that the woman is the daughter-in-law of a wealthy merchant surnamed Su Zhou, who is traveling in Shanghai. After being injured by jumping from the building and being sent to the hospital, she died shortly after. It is heard that the woman was always quarreling with her in-laws, husband, etc., and had ten children, both boys and girls. The reason for her suicide this time is unknown. Yesterday, after the woman's body was examined, it was claimed and coffined by her family members.</p>
<h3>Drivers of Taxis at Delorme Company Demand Maintenance Fees</h3>
<p>The Delorme Company's taxis on Avenue Foch have stopped operating due to lack of gasoline, causing all employees to suddenly lose their jobs. At 4:00 pm yesterday, about 300 employees gathered at the company to demand maintenance fees from the capital side. After the French Police Department's political department sent personnel to mediate, the company initially agreed to pay two months' salary, which was inconsistent with the employees' opinions. After interrogation by the police station, they were all released at around 7:00 pm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper's publishing time was 6:10 pm.</p>
<h3>Unreturned Change for Foreign Rice Sales Reaches 600,000 Yuan; Rice Merchants Request That Two Foreign Firms Be Ordered to Clear the Debt</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Office yesterday continued to handle the applications of various rice shops for the allocation of foreign rice for sale, and also began to accept the applications of hospitals, schools, and factories. Therefore, the number of people who went to the office to fill out forms and pay was increasing. The foreign rice that was allocated to various rice shops yesterday for retail sales was still distributed from the Taikoo, Xiamen Road Shinyuan, and Baker Road Motai warehouses on the Bund. Yesterday, the opened warehouse of the Taikoo godown was still Warehouse No. 2, starting from 3:00 pm until it was completely distributed at 4:00 pm, with a total of 1,110 bags of rice. Except for 110 bags belonging to passenger rice, the rest were all applied for by various rice shops to meet the retail sales.</p>
<p>Piloting Stamping</p>
<p>Some rice shops yesterday implemented the practice of stamping the palms of the hands of retail buyers with the seal issued by the Public Works Department for recording. The seals are changed daily, and the color is green. During the implementation, the rice shops felt that the hands were troublesome and will request the Public Works Department to make improvements. The ink becomes blurred after a few hours.</p>
<p>Request for Return of Change</p>
<p>In the past, the procedures for paying for and delivering Hong Kong foreign rice directly purchased by the Public Works Department were handled by the British firm Jebsen &amp; Jessen Trading Co., Ltd.. At that time, for the sake of speed and convenience, the rice payments were all paid in whole numbers, and it was planned to return the change (overpaid amount) on a regular basis. The same method was adopted for the distribution and sale of foreign rice stored in warehouses by various rice shops this time. It is heard that the total amount of change from the two cases is about 600,000 yuan in legal currency. Although the guild has sent letters urging the repayment, it has not been returned. In view of the current tight money and difficulty in turnover, it is heard that the industry is requesting the authorities to order the two foreign firms to clear the debt as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Basketball Tournament; Blue and White B Beat Shanghai Bank Yesterday; Monacos Defeat Chen You by a Wide Margin</h3>
<p>There were originally three competitions in the Western Youth Basketball Tournament yesterday. Due to the withdrawal of Liangxi in Group A, only two games remained in Group B. In the first game, Monacos vs. Chen You, the strength of the two sides was far apart, and the game became one-sided. In the first half, the score was 12 to 2, with Chen You's Xu Shengzhi making a solo contribution. After the break, Chen You was even more unable to support, and only Wang Liyi scored a point on a free throw. As a result, Monacos defeated Chen You by a large margin of 34 to 3. In the second game, Blue and White B vs. Shanghai Bank, the game was full of wonderful moments. After the start, Shanghai Bank's Pan Jianhua scored a red heart first. Blue and White's Huang Peijun scored two goals. Gao Xilin scored on a free throw. Blue and White took the lead with 5 to 2. Shanghai Bank's Pan Jianhua and Zhou Jun each scored a goal, tying the score at 5 to 5. Blue and White B's Huang Peijun and Xu Zuzui suddenly became active again, exceeding again with 11 to 5. Then, Shanghai Bank's Zhou Jun made a contribution, and Gao Xilin also scored for Blue and White. The first half ended with Blue and White B taking the lead with 13 to 9. After the break, Shanghai Bank's Ye Zuyao made a successful sneak attack, and Zhou Zhixin scored on a free throw, tying the score at 13 to 13 for the second time. Blue and White's Huang Peijun put the ball in under the basket, and Huang Zhijun scored on a free throw, taking the lead again with 16 to 13. At this time, Gao Xilin was sent off for four fouls. Shanghai Bank launched a counterattack, tying the score at 16 to 16 for the third time. At this time, the atmosphere suddenly became tense. In the last few seconds, Blue and White's Huang Peijun made a wonderful comeback and actually scored a goal. Soon, the time ran out, and Blue and White B defeated Shanghai Bank with a score of 18 to 16. Now, in addition to Blue and White, Liangxi has announced its withdrawal from the competition. It is heard that Shanghai Star and Lianxing also intend to withdraw. Therefore, only three teams remain: Giant, Fuli, and Zhongyi, and the interest in competition has decreased even more. Also, the three competitions that were originally scheduled for tomorrow have been cancelled due to Christmas Eve. There will be no games this week and will be continued next year. The results of yesterday's game between Blue and White B and Shanghai Bank are recorded below.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Financial System: Recent Developments</h3>
<p>Since December 8th, Shanghai's financial situation has undergone several changes: The business hours of all banks have been shortened to 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM, totaling three hours. Withdrawals are restricted; for deposits made before December 8th, withdrawals are uniformly limited to 500 yuan, permitted once every three days. For all current account withdrawals, banks are to adhere to the "Provisional Measures for Banking and Money Shop Operations" as resolved by the Provisional Joint Conference of the Shanghai Bankers and Money Dealers Association, concerning balances up to December 6th, 1941. Cash payments should be limited to checks presented directly at the counter. Checks collected by Chinese and foreign counterparts on behalf of depositors, unless the original check bears a stamp indicating "Cash Payment" or similar wording that has not been crossed out, should be settled through transfer procedures. Cash deposited after December 8th should be placed in a separate cash account. Banks should stamp the word "Cash" on blank checks issued for these accounts. All checks drawn on cash accounts, whether presented directly at the counter or through clearing, should be paid in cash. Banks that issued blank checks with "Cash Payment" or equivalent stamps to depositors before December 6th, 1941, should notify depositors to cross out these stamps. Otherwise, checks submitted for clearing by foreign banks will be paid by the clearinghouse from the bank's cash account. A foreign bank clearing group has been established, including Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Chosen, Bank of Taiwan, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Banque de l'Indochine, Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, Banca Italo-Cinese, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, Banque Franco-Chinoise, and Shanghai (Hongkou) branches of thirteen banks as members, with the Joint Reserve Committee of the Shanghai Banking Association participating to facilitate clearing. Chinese banks deposit funds with HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase Bank. After reconciliation, the balances of Chinese banks held in these four foreign banks are drawn through checkbooks issued by Yokohama Specie Bank, in the form of overdrafts with signed checks indicating only the amount. These deposits in the four foreign banks serve as collateral. All mortgage loans made by Chinese banks each week must be reported for review. Originally, "crossed checks" were for same-day cash withdrawals, but now they are processed as remittances, with the old remittance terminology abolished. "Crossed checks" are now no different from the old remittances. Since crossed checks cannot be cashed, cash must be obtained through discounting. The initial discounting volume was substantial, but recently it has stabilized, with rates at 0.3% or even at par. The trend is towards carrying cash, which is cumbersome and risky. Eventually, a large amount of cash will flow into the market, and perhaps there will be no more discounting in the future; it is even possible that crossed checks will trade at a premium. (White)</p>
<h3>Cash Enters the 10,000 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>The black market price of gold has plummeted alarmingly, penetrating the 10,000 yuan mark. Public sentiment is down amidst various rumors, and the flow of physical gold has surged. In the morning, around 9:30 AM, some silver firms traded ten taels (ten liang) at 10,700 yuan. When the Jin Hao Bang Cheng Ji firm aggressively bought 50 taels, prices temporarily rose to 11,000 yuan. Shortly after, a certain bank suddenly dumped its holdings, and Tian Yuan, the exchange shop Xin Feng Yong, and a certain gold firm aggressively sold, causing a sharp decline to around 10,600 yuan. Securities firms and the silver trade association Gong He bought in, attempting to stabilize the market. However, banks continued to sell aggressively, with Tian Yuan and Shi He competing to sell, accelerating the decline. Upon falling below 10,000 yuan, there were even fewer buyers, and the price plummeted by 1,600 yuan, with one transaction at a low of 9,000 yuan for ten taels, absorbed by securities firms and Cheng Ji. A certain silversmith reduced purchases. Around 11:00 AM, the price recovered to 9,700-9,800 yuan. Tian Yuan sold again, dragging it down to 9,350 yuan. Subsequently, trading thinned, and bargain hunters emerged, pushing the price back up to 9,500-9,600 yuan. No further transactions occurred in the afternoon, and the price remained around 9,500 yuan, down 1,200 yuan from last Saturday. Over the past two weeks, the price has fallen by over 4,300 yuan. The price difference on the day was 2,000 yuan, with a trading volume of several hundred taels. The exchange rate for gold ornaments decreased three times at Da Tong Hang and Xin Tong Hang, falling a total of 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan per tael. Purchases were reduced by 200 yuan. Silver ingots remained at 18 yuan per tael, and the black market price was 11 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bond Market Reopens</h3>
<p>The bond market resumed trading yesterday. Trading began at 9:30 AM and closed at 10:00 AM. Settlement matters were handled after 10:00 AM, conveniently within bank clearing hours. There was no afternoon session. The bond market was the first to resume operations. The market was lively with attendees yesterday. Upon opening, Western bonds were priced at 63.8 yuan, and Type A bonds traded at 69 yuan, aligning with off-market prices. However, there was a surge in sellers, particularly Tong Yi. Zhong Fu offered Type E bonds, while Run De and Jiu Feng also sold. Most were forced liquidations. Buyers included Le Mao and Geng Xing, and speculative short covering was also significant. Type C bonds traded as low as 60.05 yuan, nearly breaking the 60 yuan barrier. Type E bonds opened at 61 yuan and rose to 62 yuan, but ultimately broke the 60 yuan barrier as well. Type A bonds traded at a minimum price of 64 yuan, and Type B bonds traded at a minimum price of 60.08 yuan, making them the most cost-effective among the various bond types. Type B and Type C bonds were priced at par, while Type A bonds were only 3.7 yuan higher than Type C bonds. The market price was about 2 to 4 yuan lower than the off-market price on the 20th, and a sharp decline of 6.5 to 9.8 yuan compared to the closing price on the 6th of this month. Approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan worth of bonds were traded. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton mills fell to 25 yuan, reclamation to 18 yuan, and Asia shipyard stocks to around 10 yuan. Other utility and rubber stock prices were halved from their pre-suspension (5th) closing prices.</p>
<h3>National Rice Supply Is Not Smooth or Unimpeded</h3>
<p>Although the national rice supply was interrupted for one day on Sunday, there was no significant accumulation. Only about 210 shi arrived. Demand from buyers was subdued due to the recent price declines. Although vendors initially quoted 261 yuan for Bo Dao rice in the morning, no deals were made. Trading started only after the price dropped to 255 yuan, but sellers remained willing to sell. Ultimately, the lowest price was only 252 yuan. There was no market for Hou Geng rice due to a lack of supply. As for foreign rice, warehouses such as Taikoo, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and Standard Oil have reopened, but only rice designated for public use can be released. Therefore, crowds still gather in front of the stabilized rice price shops, and panic buying has not subsided. Restoring operations at all stores under proper management would alleviate congestion and stabilize the food supply. Recently, the rice trade in the French Concession has been active, while it has been sluggish in the International Settlement. It is said that small packages are piled up and cannot be distributed, which is why the food supply within the Settlement remains difficult.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Continue to Weaken; 600 Bales of Yao Cotton Arrive</h3>
<p>The yarn market is currently stable, but mill prices are trending weaker. This is due to the sharp decline in gold prices, which has created uncertainty. The mill price for 20-count Shuang Ma yarn is 1,750 yuan, down 110 yuan from Saturday. Ten bales were traded on the yarn exchange. However, the spot price for 20-count Shuang Ma is 2,060 yuan, the spot price for 20-count Tian Nu yarn is 2,365 yuan, and the price for 20-count Lan Feng yarn is 2,200 yuan. No other transactions were reported.</p>
<p>The exchange held a meeting yesterday morning with the authorities and brokers. As a result, it was decided that due to the year-end, operations would resume on January 10th of next year. The authorities have allowed for the extension of settlement for all contracts expiring in December of this year.</p>
<p>Cotton trading was hampered by warehouse deposits and no deals were made. The domestic cotton supply is entirely under control, resulting in very few Hua Yi cotton from Jiangbei and Tongzhou this autumn. Very little cotton has arrived from eastern Zhejiang. It is known that recently, a number of shipments have arrived by boat from Ningbo. Yesterday morning, the Wan Ji vessel arrived from Ningbo, carrying over 600 bales. The vessel docked at Wharf 13 on the Bund, and cargo was unloaded.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Trading: Spot Settlement Resolved; Futures Unlikely to Resume This Year</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market is sluggish. Most cloth merchants, except for retail sales, are making few wholesale transactions at inconsistent prices. There are many transactions for 16-pound Hua Die group cloth. Over the past week, the highest price was 105 yuan, and the lowest was 97.5 yuan. Yesterday, it sold at 99 yuan and 100 yuan, an increase of 7.5 yuan compared to the last price before the market suspension. Yesterday, traders still lacked enthusiasm for transactions. Local demand increased slightly, with over one hundred pieces of rough cloth of the Hua Die brand transacted, along with over two thousand bolts of thread velvet and colored cloth: Ningbo help at 80 yuan, 11-pound Three Rabbit at 70 yuan, 9-pound Five Blessings at 61 yuan, Da Peng fine cloth at 85 yuan, and Fu Gui at 85 yuan and Fu Gui twill at 79 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth: The exchange held a meeting yesterday with no results. Another meeting is scheduled for the 27th, so a resumption this year is unlikely. The settlement issue for the spot market has been resolved. The factory price for 12-pound Long Tou fine cloth is set at 84 yuan per bolt, and Jun Zi Beji at 3 yuan per yard. Traders settled accounts with each other yesterday morning. There were over one hundred bales of Lao Long Tou fine cloth and about two hundred cases of Si Jun Zi Beji, all settled in cash at the above prices. For new transactions, Long Tou fine cloth traded at 84.5 yuan, while warehouse prices were lower than spot prices, with bids ranging from 83.25 yuan to 83.75 yuan, with 30 to 40 bales traded. The situation was similar for Si Jun Zi Beji: spot prices traded at 3.045 yuan, while factory prices were only 2.975 yuan.</p>
<h3>This Warehouse Handles Sugar Registration</h3>
<p>The sugar market is stagnant due to the Bureau of Works handling registration for goods in this warehouse, and the permits are still pending. There are no market transactions. As for the registered goods in other warehouses, there is no practical solution. A proper and feasible regulation is needed before a formal market can be established.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Designing an Economical Cafeteria</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Due to the uneven distribution of rice, several restaurants have recently closed their downstairs seating and only serve "upstairs" customers. Because customers who go upstairs always order several jin of wine and several dishes, the capacity of their stomachs is mostly taken up by the wine and dishes before they even get to the rice. Downstairs seating, on the other hand, is for the "rough sorts" who eat three large bowls of rice with a bowl of tofu soup or a plate of yellow bean sprouts. The income is small, and the demand for rice is high, so it's impossible to make a profit. It's the opposite of "opening a restaurant and not fearing big bellies," but the poor are precisely the ones with big bellies.</p>
<p>Moreover, these customers who "can't" go "upstairs," and their families (or even bachelors), mostly "work to eat" and can't find the time to stand in line. So when it's "time for everyone to eat," they hesitate between calculating their money and feeling their bellies.</p>
<p>What should be done with these people? That's why I think the student economical cafeteria at the Northern Sichuan Road YMCA is worth emulating or expanding.</p>
<p>The method of the YMCA student economical cafeteria is like this: All students can purchase an "admission ticket" with their membership card, receive a bowl and chopsticks, and then get their food from the kitchen on a first-come, first-served basis. The price seems to be eight jiao.</p>
<p>Using this method, establish a large cafeteria in a central location in both the British and French Concessions. If there is sincerity to put this into practice, it probably isn't a difficult thing. Here are a few key points that are temporarily proposed:</p>
<p>The cooks should be experienced, because they can buy the most and cheapest ingredients in the market that day. Their cooking skills will naturally be higher.</p>
<p>Selling meal tickets separately would be too troublesome. They can be sold in booklets of five or ten.</p>
<p>Serve both the vegetables and rice in one container, which saves labor and reduces the risk of "breaking bowls."</p>
<p>Have several attendants in the cafeteria (depending on the situation) to collect the used utensils. Naturally, there should also be dedicated staff to handle the washing.</p>
<p>Diners must strictly maintain order.</p>
<p>Service hours should be within two specified times: 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>As for the rice supply, the person in charge can request it from the authorities in both Concessions, or even ask for their assistance.</p>
<p>Except for all necessary expenses, profits should not exceed one percent, and this one percent should be accumulated as a reserve for emergencies (such as purchasing utensils).</p>
<p>Of course, this is not "doing business," and it should be taken more seriously than "doing business." It is hoped that interested people will come forward to do this professional work, which can also be considered a charitable endeavor.</p>
<h3>Interest</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ge</p>
<p>Everyone has their own interests according to their nature. Liking gambling is an interest, liking women is also an interest; focusing on a career is an interest, and focusing on learning is an even greater interest. People without interests find everything dull; with interest, their spirits are a hundredfold.</p>
<p>But the explanation of interest is never this simple. Mr. Liang Rengong once said: If you were to dissect him, there would be nothing but interest. The interest he referred to, which was the essence of his being, was not a general interest, but specifically his dedication to studying and learning, never self-satisfied, never ending, and always full of interest. That is true interest.</p>
<p>"Playing with things ruins ambition." We don't necessarily believe that this is a universal truth, but comparing the interest in gambling and women to the interest in learning, the difference is simply incalculable. In the past and present, the general public's interest has been concentrated on gambling and women. This phenomenon exists among those who are already working, and it's no different for students who are still studying. To give a clear example: the dance halls on North Sichuan Road used to be mostly frequented by college students from Jiangwan. And recently, during the holiday commemorating the birth of Sun Yat-sen, there was news of dozens of university students being arrested for gambling and fined. College students have no interest in studying and take the opposite path. This kind of spirit is unacceptable.</p>
<p>We should encourage ourselves to increase our interest in our careers and studies.</p>
<h3>Returning from Buying Rice</h3>
<p>— Dong Zhi</p>
<p>I have recently found pleasure in reading, which nourishes the mind. My family has only a few liters of rice left, and I almost feel the same as Han Le Wu. But standing in line to buy rice is ultimately fruitless. Returning home, I read in Liezi's "On Strength and Fate" that "Dongmen Wu of Wei died without sorrow, and his steward said: 'You loved your son more than anything else in the world. Why are you not sad now that your son has died?' Dongmen Wu said: 'I used to have no son, and I was not sad when I had no son. Now that my son is dead, it is the same as having no son, so why should I be sad? It is the force of circumstances, it is fate.'" I suddenly comforted myself, thinking that I often have no rice, and I was not sad when I had no rice. Now that I cannot buy rice, it is the same as having no rice, so why should I be sad? Then I thought to myself, selling rice is doing everything humanly possible, but not being able to squeeze in line to buy rice is fate. I cannot give up buying rice just because I cannot squeeze in line. This is doing everything humanly possible and awaiting fate.</p>
<h3>Christmas and Joining the Fun</h3>
<p>— Tu Tu</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, mothers secretly fill a new sock with candies and toys. When children wake up early in the morning, they are surprised to receive this gift, believing that it was delivered by a white-bearded Santa Claus while they were asleep. Their little hearts believe this is a miracle, and they look forward to the next Christmas day. In previous years, the almost insane excitement of Christmas Eve would cause many young men and women to fondly recall and look forward to the coming year. The young people's desire for enjoyment and the children's hope of receiving Christmas gifts can be said to be the same longing.</p>
<p>Based on my experience of Christmas, the annual splendid embellishment is entirely made up of many people who love to join the fun. They seem to have been born solely for entertainment, especially the young people, who are the most sincere. Of course, they are not necessarily children of Christ.</p>
<p>In previous years, these days were filled with the atmosphere of the approaching Christmas. People who love to join the fun were already preparing for revelry. This year, however, it is a desolate and bleak sight. Except for a few occasional displays in shop windows with Santa Claus and sparse winter festival gifts, it is almost easy to forget that the holiday is just around the corner. The number of people joining the fun will undoubtedly decrease sharply. Most of them are already struggling in the chains of rice and coal. After all, enjoyment cannot be eaten as food. It is predicted that this year's Christmas will lack people who celebrate the occasion, and Santa Claus will just have to stare blankly and sigh repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou'ou</p>
<p>Fifteen. "Dad, let's go busking!"</p>
<p>Besides trying his best to comfort her, Mei Bao herself was always extra cautious. No matter what day it was, she never wore bright clothes, always wearing a blue cloth jacket on top. Powder and rouge had been completely separated from her since the day she started busking. When singing in front of customers, although she didn't keep her face as if she was angry with them, she never laughed lightly. If a customer asked something, she always let the girl from the Han family respond. She just stood quietly on the side.</p>
<p>"That tall girl is really pretty, but it's a pity she doesn't talk, like a clay beauty." Because Mei Bao didn't open her mouth, customers often discussed her like this.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Qiu Haitang, of course, felt very annoyed. In fact, saying a few words quietly like this, with the scope of the conversation limited to comments and evaluations, was still considered a good customer! Some simply treated them like prostitutes, pulling hands and pouring wine. If it weren't for the Han family father and daughter always standing in front, Qiu Haitang would have been fighting with people every day, and the few coins they earned would only be enough to buy some band-aids and medicinal cotton wool!</p>

<h3>Discussing "Family Entertainment": Plucking the Zither Under a Coptis Tree</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>For the past five years, I have not stepped into a movie theater once, because life is hard, my mood is bad, and it's not easy to earn money. What mood do I have for entertainment? Since the January 28th Incident and the outbreak of the Pacific War, life has been even harder and the economy even more difficult! Such melancholy and boredom are, in spirit, a great loss! So how to adjust? Watch Peking opera? Watch movies? Neither is affordable. "Plucking the zither under a Coptis tree," I think the only way is to practice "family entertainment." So-called "family entertainment" includes playing the harmonica or organ; playing Go or Chinese chess; gathering the family to tell stories; studying books, paintings, bronzes, and stones; enjoying tea and conversation; playing finger-guessing games or drinking games; or even playing "hygienic mahjong" once a day (the number of rounds should be small). The sole purpose of recreation is to cleanse worldly thoughts and relieve mental and physical distress. In this increasingly turbulent era, saving a penny is a penny, and saving a cent is a cent. The enjoyment of material entertainment may be bitter, but mental aspects must be specially adjusted. What do readers think?</p>
<h3>Theater and Arts News</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Confucius is being brought to the stage by the China Travel Troupe and is set to be performed after "Tears on Scented Paper," with Tang Huaiqiu leading the original cast in full cooperation.</p>
<p>Wang Xichun's new work after "Fragrant Garden Flowers" is "Paradise Dreams," adapted from Zhang Henshui's "Lost Goose at Dusk," directed by Fang Peilin.</p>
<p>The Xin Yi Drama Society, an amateur organization of film and theater professionals, has suffered losses in successive performances. Recently, due to the busy schedules of various members, they have no time to act, so they have announced their dissolution after "Going to Work" and "Going to the Theater."</p>
<p>The Jin Xing Film Company, established for more than a year, has suspended operations due to the impact of the war, so the "Eternity" directed by Shu Shi has also been aborted.</p>
<h3>Notes from the Pear Garden</h3>

<h3>Blood Rain on the Fine Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Lighting Candles to Welcome the Battlefield</p>
<p>The next day, the Qing army discovered the incident and arrested nearby residents, asking about the murderer, but could not find any clues. Prince Regent Dorgon was enraged by the writing on the tree, believing it had insulted the Qing army. He severely reprimanded his subordinates to step up the search and ordered his troops to abide by discipline and not to leave the camp without reason. He had the heads on the trees and the corpses in the river collected and buried. He did not know who had done this deliberately to provoke the Qing army, so he had the words carved on the tree and the heads hung on the branches. He also believed that this matter could not be done by ordinary people, because the heads were hung very high and it was not easy to take them down. He suspected that the Ming generals under Wu Sangui might have secretly colluded with the Qing soldiers to oppose him. Therefore, he notified Wu Sangui and instructed him to strictly question his subordinates and not to seek revenge. Wu Sangui naturally obeyed and issued an edict. However, he was still obsessed with Yuanyuan, and because he could not find her, he was unusually upset. He volunteered to Prince Regent Dorgon to pursue and capture Li Chuang. Prince Regent Dorgon also needed to use troops urgently because the ringleader had not yet been captured, so after discussion, they divided their troops into two groups to pursue and suppress the bandits. Prince Ying Azig and Prince Yu Dodo led the Qing troops as the left wing. Wu Sangui led the Ming troops as the right wing. The Ming soldiers had no choice but to set out after seeing the order. Zhang Cangqiu and others were somewhat dissatisfied, believing that the Ming army, having defeated the bandits with the help of the Qing army and recovered Yanjing, should appease the people, quickly establish a Ming descendant, and settle the grand plan as soon as possible. Although the bandits should be pursued and suppressed, compared to each other, it was better to let the bandits eke out a living. Now, the reason why Wu Sangui insisted on pursuing them was for his beloved concubine Chen Yuanyuan, vowing to retrieve her, unwilling to let go, showing that the general's heart was only on [omitted] and not on the great plan of the country.

<h3>Talents Cultivated by the Opera School (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yan Xi</p>
<p>(C) Jing (Painted Face) Zhou Zhengli - Truly a rare talent in the present era. It is truly a gratifying thing that he has such achievements. He is skilled in posture. What satisfies me most about his performances is "Shepherd's Tiger Pass," Sima Yi in "Empty City Stratagem," and "Golden Terrace."</p>
<p>Wang Zhengsen - Probably very young! His voice seems very tender, but it is very pleasant to listen to, especially his recitations. He rarely plays leading roles. I remember Li Kui in "Raising Havoc in Qingzhou" was very good.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengpeng - Good voice, but too few roles!</p>
<p>(D) Chou (Clown) Xing Zhenghao - It is very difficult to sing and act as a small Hua Lian (Painted Face), especially when children do it. If the clown is a very, very small child, it is easy to make people laugh because they are small. But that is not the case with him. There are many people smaller than him in the opera school, such as Sun Zhengyang and Wang Zhenglian, who also play small Hua Lian, but he is not considered the best. Although he has pitifully few roles, please watch Zhang Biegu in "The Urn Case" and the gatekeeper in "Panguan." How clear his articulation is, how beautiful his movements are! But the opera school has given many small Hua Lian roles to Sun Zhengyang. It is a pity for him. I hope the opera school will not bury a bright star.</p>
<p>Sun Zhengyang - Actually, he is not bad either. Because he is small, he easily attracts attention and laughter. Sometimes his recitations are like reciting a book, with no tone, and his face lacks expression. His signature roles are Jia Gui in "Famen Temple" and Chong Gongdao in "Taking the Woman Away."</p>
<p>Wusheng (Martial Actor) Jing Zhengfei - He is clean, light as a swallow, and has a small braid on his head, which is most noticeable. He always receives a full house of applause when he performs.</p>
<p>There are many other good talents, such as Zheng Zhengxue, Lu Zhengmei, Peng Zhengling, Wang Zhengkang, and Zhou Zhengwen, who are all very good. Because they made a shallower impression on me, I have not written about them individually. The above is entirely my personal opinion. Of course, benevolent people see benevolence, and wise people see wisdom. It cannot be generalized.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Arts Talk</p>
<h3>The Adjutant Play</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>The comic drama of the Tang Dynasty was called the Adjutant Play. The term "adjutant" (參軍) was originally an official title, and there are three different theories about its origin. One theory states that it began in the Later Han Dynasty when Shi Dan, the magistrate of Guantao, committed an offense. Emperor He, valuing his talent, spared him from punishment. During every banquet, he was made to wear a white jacket and ordered the actors to humiliate him. This continued for a year before he was released, later becoming an adjutant. Another theory suggests it began in the Later Zhao Dynasty when Zhou Yan, an adjutant of Shi Le and the magistrate of Guantao, was imprisoned for wrongly adjudicating several bolts of silk. He was later pardoned after someone interceded on his behalf. Afterwards, during every gathering, actors would ridicule him in jest. A third theory claims it originated in the Tang Dynasty. During the Kaiyuan era, Li Xianhe was skilled in acting, and Emperor Ming specifically appointed him as the Military Adjutant of Shaozhou. According to all accounts, each mentions the magistrate of Guantao, and the events are generally the same. Wang Guowei believes that the account from the Later Zhao Dynasty is more credible. It seems that in ancient times, there were actual events that people imitated and then gradually developed into the Adjutant Play. The play primarily focused on teasing and ridiculing, and there were also songs and female performers. For example, Fan Chu's "Xi You Yi" states, "When I inquired about Zhejiang East, there were actors Zhou Ji Nan, Ji Chong, and his wife Liu Caichun, who came from Huaidian and were skilled at performing the Adjutant Play, their singing voices piercing the clouds." Today, many comic actors also sing, and it's not merely about eliciting laughter through words and actions.</p>
