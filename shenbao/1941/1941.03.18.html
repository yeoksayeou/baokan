<h3>美已建立外交政策　世界局勢將見開展　寇利博士報告有利于中國　需要物品淸單携回華盛頓</h3>
<p>華盛頓　遠東問題專家昨稱、羅斯福總統星期六晚之演詞、已在援華程序中大放「曙光」、專家表示、寇利博士、所撰之報吿、大部皆有利於中國、數方面前曾認爲寇利博士在未返此之前、會呈交不利華方之報吿、因政府最近始鄭重申明援華之意向也、外交界曾一度猜測、認爲蔣委員長與共產黨所發生之糾紛、勢將妨礙美國援華、因美國深恐蔣委員長竟致因此與蘇聯絕交、而造成一困難之外交局勢也、自雜期福總統以掃蕩之姿態贊助蔣委員長領導下之國民政府、並聲明（美國已吿以中國將得吾人之援助）後、上述不利華方之消息、已成爲全無根據之談、惟政府尚未表示若何援華、截至目前止、美國之注意力集中於英·希兩國、然消自靈通界相信、寇利博士已携有淸單一紙、列舉中國所需要之物品·消息靈通界又稱、中國之地位與央國絕對不同、數月之後、英國局勢或有急轉直下之可能、中國則早已習慣日本之尖銳壓力、而無所用其恐懼矣、實際上、多數專家且認爲、中國現已發動攻勢云、（十七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　羅斯福總統昨所發表之廣播演說、爲此問熱烈歡迎、對其中涉及中國一段、允感興趣、咸謂、此乃對於中國作戰一種新的鼓勵、外國對於所謂新四軍事件所傳種種謠言、已不攻自破、抑新四軍業已確定解散、要之、國際形勢對於中國較前益佳、本月十四日、中國空軍在成都、萬縣上空空戰所獲勝利、可爲友邦在物質上援助之證據、（十七日哈瓦期電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統發表將以全力援助中·英·希臘三國、直至獲得最　勝利而後已之演說後、衆認此乃羅斯福就任總統以來最重要演說之一、將來必成爲美國歷史上最重要文獻之一、昨夜爲羅斯福在白宮設宴招待新聞記者協會會員及重要政府官吏匕百餘入、是項宴會、每年一次、今年爲羅斯福總統就職以來之第八决、但今年爲羅斯福初决發表如此重要性之演說、　演詞事後以十二種言語向全世界廣播、羅斯福論及中國之作戰、足證渠對於中國之關切與同情、彼發言時、語調極低、有時忽揚忽抑、加重其意義、對蔣介石三字、則分三字發音、略似華人之發音、當彼對中國之一節說畢時、全塲掌聲雷動、（十六日電）</p>
<p>紐約　全世界之國都、包括華盛頓在內、相信世界局勢將因羅斯福援助民治國之熱烈演說而有新的進展、此種現象、昨日至爲明顯、華盛頓官方認爲、此項演說乃美國企圖戰敗軸心國家一種不可挽回之自承、美國內閣閣員預言、美國軍用品輸英·將大形增加、彼等感到羅斯福總統已無異保證英國之勝利、閣員並認爲新進展即將來臨、</p>
<p>各方反響</p>
<p>華盛頓對羅斯福總統演詞之反響、最先被認爲呼籲團結、以支持此後之美國政策、其决爲衆人對演詞之廣大範圍、感到興趣、外交家及觀察家認爲、自世界大戰以來、美國行政首腦所作之大膽演詞、當以此决爲最、羅斯福總統邀請各淪陷國家之居民、起而反抗、並許諾美國必將加援功、渠向在蔣委員長領導下之中國國民政府提出保證、且允許援助其他一切願抵抗全能國之國家、凡此種種、皆使外交家及政府官吏感到總統無異建立美國之外交政策、衆認爲總統自發表演說　、美國外交政策已不啻向軸心間接挑戰之立塲、美國之挑戰力式、係以保證以全力援助中，英、肴及其他反抗軸心國家表現之、倫敦對演詞之反應、甚爲欣悅、英國廣播公司代表英人表示感激、該公司云、英國在邱吉爾領導下、美國在羅斯福領導下、兩國之民治陣綫、將皆屹然不動、柏林方面對此、則避免立即有所批評、可靠之羅馬義人方面則稱、該演詞使日外相松岡洋右之訪問德·義·益形重要、此事有關軸心國對美之立塲、而與軸心　之春季攻勢亦有關係、某義人方面則認爲、此項演詞實際上實爲一堅强之宜戰言論、但軸心國將不致有何强烈之反應、斯丹埠之消息靈通界問稱、民治國已攫得春季活勳之主動地位、父稱、至於松岡洋右之旅程、則日本不外希望希特勒幫助日本、誘使蘇聯對日簽訂不侵犯條約、俾日本得以解除後顧之憂、以對付美國耳、南斯拉夫京城則傳出消息、謂該處政界人士深信、數週或數月、美國即將成爲一交戰國、（十七日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>美加緊獲致　國防原料</h3>
<p>華盛頓　可靠方面稱、國防官員曾向美國海軍委員會提出一表、開列須從南美遠東及其他各地獲得之重要原料及物品六十種、此項原料及物品、俱係美國海、陸軍所認爲係國防生產所必須、而係美國所欲獲致、以爲準備存貨者、其中有橡皮、雲母、鎳、石英水晶等、消息靈通方面稱、政府方面現正從事大規模改組航運路綫、上述命令不過此程序中之一部份而已、（十七日合衆社電）</p>

<p>滿洲里　日外相松岡一行、今日侵晨由哈爾濱乘火車抵此、均居旅館、未外出、旋乘火車赴莫斯科、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間某某外交界力面今日謂彼等接獲消息、日外相松岡將遊說德義、在美國租借程序尚未推進以前、與英談判和平、結束歐戰，據推測、日本此次因調停泰越衝突成功、頗爲得意、故欲冉試身手、調停歐戰、其動機之起、一部分或由於預料美將援華、歐戰治吿結束、援華恐將趨减退也、（十七日國際社電）</p>
<p>亞爾尼爾斯　此間法官方今晨謂、日外相松岡、有廣博之和平計劃、携至柏林、以調停全部歐戰、傳松岡將力請敎皇庇護　十二世贊助、又據稱、松岡亦請英法合作、以求其成、（十七日國際電）</p>
<p>土京　昨日愛克達報稱、美國援央之軍用品、僅有日本參戰方能阻止之、故日外相松岡之訪問柏林羅馬、更有重大意義、該報稱、日本因感英將因美國不斷之援助而獲得勝利、故即刻遺松岡訪歐、並知　義在遠東或未能予日援助、故最低限度、亦須德國助其與俄訂立互不侵犯條約、（十七日合衆社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國實施租借案與中國</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福氏於軍具租借案實施之始，在十五晚新聞記者聯合會年宴席上，發表莊嚴雄偉的演說，說明了美國在這决世界反侵略戰爭中，所抱信念，所担任務，所作行動，以及所具贊助民治國家作戰制勝的決心。在旣往，美總統對國際雖亦屢决闡明美國政策，對租借法案雖亦屢决陳述其意義與必要，不盡抽象而空泛，不盡是開導反對派，然其性質祇是表白主持美國國政者的意願。這一决演說的性質則不然，總統意願旣經參衆兩院接受而確立爲美國國家的意願，他遂代表了而將這一國家意願昭告世界。何謂國家的意願？在現代侵略國家，以其獨裁者或其統治階層的意願爲意願，故必以獨裁者或統治階層之興起而興起，以其存在而存在，以其變更而變更，以其落沒而落沒。在民治國家的國家意願之內涵，是全國的志趣與力量，是全國的動嚮及其所爭取的事功。現在美國的全國全力，開始了趨向其意願而昂進。</p>
<p>在羅斯福氏演說之中，顯明的發揮贊助民治國家作戰制勝的原則，翻論在遠東或歐洲，無論對中國英國與希腦，乃至於廣泛的對於任何反侵略的民治國家，一體加以贊助：美國不僅是英國的兵工廠，不僅是中英希三國的兵工廠，而是民治國家反侵略的兵工廠；這一兵工廠不但不接受出賣軍具的定貨單，却慷慨的提供了出借軍具的保證；對中英希三國明白提供了，對於其他可能反侵略的民治國家亦一體提供了。故小但中英希受了支援，受了鼓勵，即如已感侵略威脅而目前尙滯留於中立階段的土耳其，於聆悉演說之餘，亦於昨日吐露其歡忻，旣視此爲對於一般民治國的整個保證，且視此爲所謂新秩序的死刑之宣判。當然，在目前有資格且期待美國租借的，只是中英希三國。</p>
<p>美國怎樣出借其軍具的詳細方案，宜不在立即公開發表之列。關於對中國的，昨晚華盛頓電稱：可信寇利博士已携有淸單一紙，列舉中國所需要的物品。我們當然不需要知道中國淸單的內容，亦不需要比較中國與英希的淸單；同時了解這一兵工廠因出品的數量與程序關係，當然未能同時立即照單借出。更據華盛頓電釩，美國方面以爲「中國之地位與英國絕對不同，數月之後，英國局勢或有急轉直下之可能，中國則早已習慣日本之尖銳壓力，而無所用其恐懼矣一；假定這也就是美國主持支配出借軍具者的見解，則可窺知美國實施其租借案時，怎樣分別緩急。我們深信中國方面雖盼切於美國的儘量予以援助，盼切於美國的儘先予以援助，然決不因聞知美國假定先予英希兩國以力援而失望。蓋中國感覺失望者，不在現在而在旣往；亦即中國認爲美國失着者，不在目前急援英希；美國誠能援助中國作戰，制止遠東侵略，在一九三一年之後，至少在歐戰西綫戰爭之前，則一切事半而功倍；換言之，民治國家早應採行各個擊破的策略、來對付侵略國家，却不應坐待侵略國家的試行其各個擊破策略；這是過去了的旣往，中國的失望與美國的失着，到現在祗有同深悔恨，祗有共圖挽救了。何况英希兩國目前確是還在急性病象之中，我們爲全世界整個民治國家陣綫打算，自應無所褊袒於中國而承認英希待援的急迫；我們自信這是公道正大的態度，亦即是對於民治的忠實。且中國確是自信必能依恃自已的力量，終於使遠東侵略者趨於崩潰，祇要美國與英國領屬以及其他民治國家，不再像以前一樣，助紂爲虐，對於侵略者繼續供給絲毫物資。這並不說：中國不需要援助。中國必勝。確定勝利祇是時間問題；但能多獲援助，早獲援助，則制勝愈速；因此之故，確亦盼切美國的及早力援。抑又不但盼切，亦確信美國必儘可能的及早力援；這因爲美國今後的援華，不像以前一樣，不是空虛的同情，不是友誼的應酬，亦即不是表示了好意便算盡了人事；他耍民治陣綫中的這一員，必獲全勝，故必供給獲致全勝的軍具；必於這一員獲致全勝之日，始是太平洋消弭危機，美國解除威脅，貫澈了美國國家的意願之時！</p>
<p>故到了現階段，中國制勝，實有兩重保證：一是中國的自力更生，一是美國的儘量援助。有此兩重保證，中國何憾於美國援助之亟於急性病象中的英希！澈底的說：中國在物資上，軍備上，確比日本爲落後；日本若不以武力侵略中國而永久保持其優勢的侵略力量，則中國將永久在彼威脅之下；日本若及早幡然變計，知難而退，而克保其殘餘的優勢，則中國仍在彼威脅之下；日本若不爲中國戰略所「拖」而硬性的速戰速敗了，或現在遽爾撒退軍隊，停止侵略，則中國至建國完成爲止，猶必朝朝暮暮在對日警戒之中。這在美國方面曁整個太平洋方面所感受的威脅，亦始終與中國同其比例。若乃中國長期作戰，而美國因亟援英希而略緩援華，這纔是中國的穩定，美國與太平洋的穩定。換一方面說，到現在爲止，亦即到中國以自力或外援完成總反攻準備爲止，日本尙把握着幡然改圖的最後機運，可是他絕對無此大智大勇；他最初的戰略是速戰速勝，他現在的幻想是死裏求生，他今後的倖運是小敗而歸，而他最終所將遭遇的不幸却是持久作戰慘敗後的澈底崩潰。由此說來，在美國援助民治國家的分別緩急之下，自有其最犧牲的一國，即日本。</p>
<p>此外，猶有不可不一言者，昨日華府電訊中，曾牽涉中共與蘇聯一節。略謂外交界曾一度猜測，認爲蔣委員長與共產黨所發生之糾紛、勢得妨碍美國援華；因美國深恐蔣委員長竟致因此與蘇聯絕交，而造成一困難之外交局勢也；自羅斯福總統以掃蕩之姿態贊助蔣委員長領導下之國民政府，並聲明美國已告以中國將得吾人之援助後，上述不利華方之消息，已成全無根據之談云去。這原是全無根據之談。推想猜測之由來：或因不了解重慶方面的這决糾紛，乃是軍令問題，並非政治問題；或因不了解蘇聯對中日戰爭的基本觀念，乃是主義以外，蘇聯國家的「安全第一」觀念；或因不了解中共的條件性質，是相對的若此希望，並非友敵的要挾；或因軸心方面最近將在莫斯科發動何種外交的詭謀，故播挑撥離間的資料，即如日本外相聘德過俄，很可能的以重慶糾紛，在莫斯科發一冷笑，發一冷箭。要知道中國爲獨立自由而戰，爲民治而戰；中國樂受外援，亦爲獨立自由與民治；中國不因接受蘇聯援助而被蘇聯剝削獨立自由，亦就不因接受美國援助而被美國剝削獨立自由。要知道蘇聯但願與獨立自由而民治的中國爲鄰，不願與被侵略控制的中國爲鄰；亦猶彼願得土耳其爲鄰，而不願其鄰羅馬尼亞與保加利亞之如今日。然則美國援華，眞是蘇聯所樂聞，豈有懷疑餘地。至於重慶的中共糾紛，不但在性質與程皮上遠在中國抗建國策之下，不必視爲如何嚴重，且糾紛發生於中國作戰之際，蘇聯必因顧念國家的悠遠的安全第一而不願因此變更中蘇國交；非若此際乃為蘇日戰時，則中國制止共黨袒蘇，將使蘇聯憤恚。簡言之，目前並非蘇日交戰而是中日交戰，故蘇聯斷乎不願中共背離中國。羅總統能洞鑒及此，故能　無返顧，宣吿援華。</p>

<h3>羅斯福總統　演說全文</h3>
<p>華盛頓　當各國京城對羅斯福總統星期六援助民主國家演說之反應、陸續到華盛頓之際、此間外交及政治觀察家、仍在研究總統演說之全文、總統之演說、自始至終、均係强烈攻擊侵略國家、並堅決允許美國必使民主國家獲得勝利、總統演說之全文如下、</p>
<p>此次白宮</p>
<p>舉行新聞記者聯會之宴會、實爲一希有之盛會、八年以來、每次宴會予必有演說、然此决之會、尙屬則見、此番集會與通常吾人於每隔兩星期所舉行之談話不同、因此决君等不能向予作任何問題之發問、且予所述之一切事情、句句均係歷史紀錄上之語、君等與予彼此互助、已有八年、予嘗使君等知悉美國總統對華盛頓之新聞、國家之新聞及世界之新聞所抱之見解、而君等亦曾將吾國人民所抱之思想、盡量予吿、在吾人舉行新聞談話中、亦如今晚之宴會參與之人、有代表各地報紙及通訊社之新聞記者、各記者中、多半對此一事情、恒發驚奇、以爲世界上之國家中、竟尙有如吾人所舉行之此種報界談話者、誠然、在若干國家中、人民之自由、已不存在、此等國家中、如吾人所有之</p>
<p>民治主義</p>
<p>之目的、如吾國、吾民所具之本質、業已起嚴重之變化、此等對民治之誤解、並非新創之事實予憶第一决世界大戰初期、德國政府曾聆悉該國在美代表之言論、謂美國人民絕不團結、謂美國人民對於和平較保持其理想與自由、更爲法意、且不惜任例代價以求和平、謂美國若以國家本身之利益爲重、則竟可引起動亂及革命、吾人今日應使歐洲、亞洲之獨裁不再懷疑吾人之團結矣、自一九三九年九月一日此番戰爭爆發以前、予對於世界之將來、所抱憂慮、實較許多人們爲甚、所演成之歷史紀錄、已表明予所顧慮者尙未週到、滔滔之水、今已冒過水閘、吾人今應及時反省旣往之事、而確定其咎何在、歷史決不能以抱有希望之思想重寫一遍、吾美人民今日係在</p>
<p>寫新歷史</p>
<p>焉、本星期中之巨大新聞故事、即係吾人已昭吿世界、表明吾國係一統之國家、並已認識富前之危險、並爲應付危險起見、吾國之民治主義業已開始動作、吾人已知普魯士之專制政治、惡劣透頂、吾人現悉納粹主義惡劣更甚、納粹勢力之企圖、不僅在變更殖民地之地圖、不僅在變更小部分歐洲疆界、納粹黨已公然欲圖毀滅世界各大陸中所有政府之選舉制度、並吾國之選舉制度、納粹黨並欲建設一種以一切人類軍隊化爲基礎之政府制度、而由彼以武力攫取權力之統治者以主宰之、納粹黨曁所有被其催眠之信徒、均呼此種政治制度爲「新秩序」、此旣非「新」、亦非「秩序」、因國際間之秩序乃係指某種能持久之事物、換言之、即係一種人類願長久生活於是之</p>
<p>正義制度</p>
<p>須知人類決不願永久生存於一種由征服者所設立、且以奴役爲基礎之制度也、此種新式暴君、爲實現其計劃、均欲摧毀一切民主政治、欲將其逐一摧毀之歐洲各國及吾國、均不贊同此種目的、遂有今日之舉、納粹主義者、於一九三九年及一九四〇年中、業已依照其計劃、進行消滅歐洲國家之工作、非至其預定計劃爲不屈不撓之英國防軍擊而粉碎、決不終止、民主政治之敵人、其所估計、已因一極簡單之理由而陷於錯誤、若輩認民主政治不能調整自身以應付戰爭世界之可怖事實、其謬誤卽在於是、若輩又信、民主政治因太尊重人權、決不能武裝自己揮戈赴戰、若輩又信、民主政治因願與隣邦共同生存於和平狀態下決不能動員其力量　禦敵、甚至自衛亦所不能、詎知若輩此種信念卽其</p>
<p>謬誤所在</p>
<p>也、軸心國自其宣傳機關所獲知之情報、遂相信征服美國、可由「內部工作」、卽係不以武力自外部進攻美國、而在美國內部、發動其搗亂、分化、離間及摧毀民氣等工作、以遂其侵略目的是也、凡相信美國可由「內部工作征服者、均係不明美國之歷史、須知美國非一可由彼綏靖派、失敗主義派及來自後門之製造恐怖者等輩予以破壞之國家、美國乃一在光天化日之下、談論自國問題、使人人均可聽得此等談論之國家也、吾人方纔已從事一偉大之辯論、此項辯論、並非僅在國會議事塲中之人司聽、此項辯論每種報紙、每一無綫電均有評論、此項辯論之最後解決及決定、由美國人民</p>
<p>自身為之、吾國民主政治之決定行事、固不免遲緩、但旣經決定、則宣布此項決定者、非任何個人、而爲一萬三千萬之美國人民、宣布以後、則吾全體均受其的束、此種事實、世界人們當已不再懷疑、吾人今日之決定、仍係中止吾國任何綏靖政策之企圖、中止吾國與彼獨裁者相謀、中止吾國與彼暴君及壓迫勢力妥協、目下之事勢、已非常緊急矣、吾人堅決相信、當吾人之生產量達到充足時、世界上之民主國家將可證明獨裁者不能獲得勝利、但現時時間上之關係極其重要、吾又現有多餘之每一飛機、每一其他戰爭用具、不論新舊、吾人皆將之送至國外、此乃普通常識之戰略、現今重大工作及吾人所負之深重貴任、卽係立卽將工廠中所堆置之生產運至民主國之戰綫上、如吾人能維持吾人現有之團結卽迅速及效能皆可獲致、吾人並無且將永無一爲威脅所屈、爲宣傳所誘之人類之虛僞團結、吾人之團結、僅能存在於能認識眞實能以智慧及勇氣應付事實之</p>
<p>自由人類</p>
<p>最後、在今後安全之唯一保障在一年之前、吾人開始建造無數之工廠、訓練大量人材、故在援助民主法案通過時、吾人已準備根據現時計劃之能力生產請求撥款七千兆元、條文之木身已包括軍火之全部及其運輸之便利、援助民主法案已於上星期二下午爲參、衆兩院通過、半小時從、余即簽署之、再過五分鐘、余即批准一立即遝送之物品項目、其中許多已在途中、在星期三余請求撥款七兆以供新物料之用、而國會亦以愛國情殷迅速通過撥款、在此間吾人現時所計及者厥爲迅速、余希望此迅速兩字不久全國皆家喩戶曉、吾人當中每人皆須犧牲、而犧牲之程度、則須視乎吾人現時行動之速率、余今晚應以坦白之言詞吿諸君、此舉對諸君及諸君之日常生活有何項意義、不論諸君係在軍隊服務抑爲鋼鐵工人、碼頭工人、機械師、家庭主婦、農夫、銀行家、肆主或製造家諸君、皆應爲國家及自身之自由而犧牲、在諸君之</p>
<p>日常生活</p>
<p>中、諸君將感覺此鉅大努力之衝擊、諸君將感覺此項努力有許多之不便利、請君須願意在商業上獲校低之利潤、因諸君之捐稅顯將增高、諸君不論爲農、爲工、皆須作更多之工作、余可明言國家所需要犧牲者、爲特別之權利、而非根本權利、吾人多數皆自願作是種犧牲、是種犧牲係爲國家之公共保障及幸福、係爲防禦歷史上最野蠻之暴行、係爲獲得現受重大威脅之生活方式之最後勝利、吾人之努力如係敷衍將事、則必致失敗、此非僅抽出一部時間所可爲者、在此項工作未完成時、吾人應推置「照常營業」及「事業如常」之觀念、吾人應全力以臨之、吾則不能勝利、吾入今後應致力於不斷增加生產之速度、致力於較吾人以前所知者更爲偉大之生產、致力於毫不停止、絕不稍休之生產、以是今晚予係向吾國境內所有愛國自由之男女之情感與理智籲訴、予請君等考慮、吾國此時之需要、泯除一切</p>
<p>個人意見</p>
<p>直至吾人獲得勝利爲止、民主政治之光輝、應使其永遠維持、而維持民主政治之光輝、人人有其賣任、個人之單獨努力、固覺其渺小、須知吾國現有一萬三千萬之個人焉、在英國及其他地方、尙有數千萬之人民、正在勇敢保護民主政治之巨熖、以免爲彼野蠻主義所熄滅、僅乎吾美人民、尙不足担任此偉大之工作也（未完待續）</p>

<h3>國際軼事（十）　美國連任三屆總統　羅斯福的起居注</h3>
<p>羅斯福擔任美國總統八年以來，其日常生活差小多一貫的成為刻板文章，很少有人能及得來他。在他的習慣上，變化或改進的地方大約只有三件事：</p>
<p>從前，他在白宮的游泳池中，每星期總要游泳五决，現在已减少爲三决。時間大的在下午五時半，在水中浸上二十分鐘至二十五分鐘之久，練習各種水中强身運動。白宮裹的麥金泰醫帥，因爲羅斯福已屆五十九歲始衰之年，在學理上認爲每星期游泳三决，已經足够。但是羅斯福的胸和臂，在水中拍擊運動，力量還很强健。游泳池中的水，其溫度常保持七十五度。游泳過後，麥醫師的助手喬治福克斯爲總統作全身按摩，約四十分鐘，某某日雖不游泳，這種按摩還是照常要舉行的。羅斯福的體重常常保持着勻衡的重量，總是在一百八十四磅至一百八十八磅之間。他在已往八年之間，超過一百九十磅的時候，眞是屈指可數的少數幾决而已。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統向有蒐集舊郵票的嗜好，他以此調濟工作上的疲勞。有時他也把郵票送到拍賣塲去，自從三屆連仟總統以來，因爲公務繁忙，這興緻已經稍爲减退了。每天，國務院送至總統府的郵件，一捆捆的不知要多少，他隨把舊郵票剪留下來。此外各地人士又常把舊郵票當作體物寄給他。他一個個把它們黏貼在集郵票簿上，寫字臺上叉放着一碗溫水，把郵票掉在其中，親手把它們從信封上撕下來。每星期杪駕舟出遊，他總是携着一包舊郵票，兩本集郵簿，手自黏貼，樂此不疲。從前每星期要化上數小時於集郵消遣的羅斯福，現在如果每星期能玩賞一决，他就覺得非常的愉快了。</p>
<p>羅斯福所收藏着的舊郵票，究竟價値幾何，從來沒有公佈過。據稱，他手頭並沒有珍奇的郵票，價値亦屬平平。但在一般人看來，他旣擁有一百多冊集郵簿，六十册放在白宮中，海德公園鎭私邸那邊也有好幾十本，其中有不少郵票爲他伯父所遺下的；再加上他本人半世以來的蒐羅和至少在他就任大總統以來八年中，得到各方面集郵專家的合作徴集，若說他的收藏品僅是些貪多濫集的平凡品，其誰信之呢？</p>
<p>第三件習慣上的改變就是少看電影。白宮裏的電影室設在二樓一個廳事裏，一星期總要開映好幾次。從前，羅斯福雖不是每决皆到，但在塲的時候總佔多數。看畢電影，再入書室辦上幾小時公務，這是他習以爲常的。現在因爲分身不開，一個月中平均只看兩决電影了。白宮中的影片由各影片公司發行處所贈映，先期由秘書歐萊選定。廳中裝置銀幕和放映機，一架配音機價値美金二萬五千元，係前總統胡佛任期中所置。羅斯福總統夫人，來賓，白宮中的號房，膳司，侍女等，當總統獨自一人，在相隔數步的圓形書室中批覽公文，或答復函件之時，他們也常在那裹觀看電影。</p>
<p>在白宮中看電影，非常舒適，大家隨使坐在椅子裹，四壁琳瑯，甚爲幽靜。羅斯福總統高興看電影時，便坐在首排或第二排椅子上。所映的如果是輕鬆短片，那末還要揷映些笑片。當他的太太或女長輩等在座時，碰到片子正配他的胃口時，他往往要如俗語所說的「放些噱頭」，使她們驚奇發笑。他敢愛看新聞片，或狄斯耐的卡通盡片。去冬上演的大笑匠卓別林名作「大獨裁者」和五彩的「紅騎血戰記」，他一看之下，大爲激賞。如果所映的片子不合他老人家的脾胃，他便老實不客氣的「中途而廢」，便由那黑種人侍役布列底門，把他從椅子中扶起來，步入書室，休息或辦公，悉從他便。</p>
<p>羅斯福的私人書室，四壁掛上船舶圖和模型，已如前述。他的寫字臺上放滿了小玩意兒，允以動物中的驢子最多，小書揷上備有「世界便覽」，聖經，擺雷脫所編的「常用格言集」和「實用標準字典」等書。臺面又不時攤置着一包包的舊郵票，和一盒雪茄烟。總統本人常吸「駱駝牌」香烟，雪茄是僅爲之敬客。</p>
<p>講到羅斯福的减少玩郵票和看電影兩件事，却又聯想到從前白宮主人生活的變遷。那時候總統的生活竟是非常的優閒可羨。其中柯立志總統一到下半天，便接連耍午睡至數小時之久；齊奧杜羅斯福總統辦了三四小時的忙碌工作後，下半天即以打拳和練習柔術作消遣。有時候他下半天閒得無事，便伴同太太的內姪女到野外去散步，或是把半天光陰化在彈子房中。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統在白宮中就住在二樓的博物院中。裹面四壁都掛滿了海舶圖。火爐上面的大輝石架，上面放了三十來隻磁猪，最大的高五英寸，漸漸的低至二寸半。最高的放在中央，左右順决的低下去。此外就是羅斯福太夫人，和他諸老友的照片，中間更點綴着各種不同式樣的木質和銅製的小驢子。</p>
<p>他的臥室在白宮中也是最隨便的一個所在，在二樓廳堂中堆着的書報往往已陳舊至幾個月。他收集着的許多船舶圖樣和模型等，往往任意被置在一起，並無特殊的理由可循。羅斯福父歡喜收藏耶穌聖誕節卡片，他的秘書勒亨女士把他心愛的藏在盒子裏，外面標上年份。目下這種聖誕節卡片已多至三千張以上了。</p>

<h3>電力公司呼籲公衆　應自動節减電流　昨招待報界說明節電原委　惟燃料來源未斷無庸憂慮</h3>
<p>上海電力公司、以燃料來源、漸感困難、經呈准市政當局、公佈臨時减電辦法、致規模較大之工商業、不無受相當打擊、上海畸形繁榮、爲之黯然遜色、益以遠東局勢、動盪不定、此後情形、是吾有江河日下之勢、於是羣情惶惑、該公司有鑒及此、乃於昨日上午十時三十分、邀集全市中外報訊者、至該公司六樓會客室、由總監督霍金斯（P.S.Hopkins）發表談話、闡明公司由於不得已而實行减電之理由、並報吿今後所採之各種步驟、原稿係英文、茲迻譯於後、</p>
<p>六個月內　無需恐慌</p>
<p>目下關於燃料缺乏問題、今日尙無新消息可資報道、但以最近報章中、時有傳聞失實之記載、故奉邀諸君、來此一談、余自應向諸君報吿者、有下列諸事實、（一）今後即無燃料運到、上海電力公司目下所存之燃料、仍可供三個月之用、（二）就通常情形言、上海電力公司、時能獲得充足煤斤、以應付百分之五十需耍、就現有存底、加以即將運來之新貨、可供六個月之用、無慮匱乏、（三）大戰正在進行中、航行船隻、日見减少、爲防患未然計、對燃料消費、自應撙節、至獲得充分存煤後、再行定奪、</p>
<p>公用事業　維持現狀</p>
<p>（四）路燈·交通·溝渠·及醫院務　、事關居民生命安全、應于維持現狀、上海電力公司決不斷絕此類電流供給、此則應加聲明者、（五）然我人對燃料若輕率予以浪費、或優柔寡斷、不立即實行限制、則終有一日、必感無X光之慮、（六）上海電力公司及工部局、自正常船隻不再來滬之第一日起、即採取必要步驟、</p>
<p>公允分配　專家研究</p>
<p>（七）上海電力公司及工部局所採取之各種步驟如下、（甲）延聘工業專家、組織預備委員會、硏究節减電流方法、對於工人及資本所將發生之問題、（乙）延聘超然獨立之經濟專家工程師、組織委員會、（丙）節减電流大用戶用電百分之三十、此舉爲將來分配電流時之初步辦法、此舉雖不科學化、與失之公允、但在詳細辦法未決定前、此爲唯一可採之步驟、（丁）經委員會硏究公允分配辦法竣事後、電流重要用戶、即可不受此項限制、或可修改其所受之限制、</p>
<p>或將採取　斷然手段</p>
<p>（戊）工部局及上海電力公司、對超過用電額之用戶、皆處以三倍之罰款、其用意純在保存電流、並非在增加收人、（己）若遇必要、則將來分配用電時、將取斷然手段、犧牲小數人、以保全大衆、（八）各當局對於解決目下之缺煤問題、皆曾盡力合作、設法予以解決、凡可以設法之處、我人皆已效勞、目下戰事正在進行、因之、若欲發放船隻來滬、亦非短時期所可辦到、同時尙望我人能自動節减電流、</p>
<p>呼籲公衆　畀予合作</p>
<p>（九）今有請求諸君協助轉吿公衆、自動節减電流、母存觀望之心、第二、勿干涉或侵擾委員會之工作、彼等富有才具、且正全神致力研究此一問題、期能爲最大多數人、得最大多數之需要、彼等無暇考慮及私人之利益、彼等所計及者、僅爲一般之原則、僅能對絕對軍要之事業、予以蠲免或例外、（十）上海電力公司已將分配電流之問題全部委托該委員會、若由上海電力公司處理此項問題、難免不有偏袒、</p>
<p>用油發電　頗受成效</p>
<p>（十一）本公司目下共有煤十五萬噸、本公司每月需煤五萬噸、目下每可靠之來煤數二萬五千噸、目下每月之缺煤數一萬五千噸、（十二）本公司預料有缺煤之危險、故用油代煤、用油發電之機器、裝置需款約五十萬元、結果甚爲成功、所惜得油之難與得煤之難、並無二致、（十三）據估計、至分配電流辦法實行時、燃料將减少至十萬噸以下、</p>
<p>工業用電　為數最鉅</p>
<p>（十四）電海工業、爲無可置辯之事、我人所能爲者、厥爲盡力設法保存電流、以供工業之用、俾工廠仍能僱用大批工人、（十五）公共租界工業用電量之百分之九六、係上海電力公司所供給、（十六）去年十二月一月中、上海電力公司所消耗之煤及油、共合煤五一·三四九噸其分配情形如下、街燈三七七噸、工部局溝渠等六三三噸、公用事業、自來水·電話·電車·自來火·公共汽車二·五三五噸、光熱電灶等九·七〇〇噸、小範圍工業用電五·一九四噸、大規模工業電三二·九、一料噸、共五一·三四九噸、應予注意者、爲五一·三四九噸中、三萬八千噸（佔百分之七十四）係工業所用、因之减電與勞工問題、甚有關係、（十七）深望各方面皆能合作、經濟用電、</p>
<p>用戶惟有　自行管制</p>
<p>（十八）困難所在、電力為「服務」而非「商品」，因之不能採計口分配辦法、統制辦法、唯有各用戶自行管理、（十九）我人不能保證、上海將有充分之燃料運到、我人已將此種情形、報吿各國當局、並相信彼等一遇可能、即將協助我人解決此項問題、余所欲報告之事、至此已畢、今將余之意見、爲諸君述之於後、</p>
<p>準備渡過　限制時期</p>
<p>（甲）我人殊無爲目前之局勢而憂慮之必要、我人僅需要準備波過一眞正限制時期、（乙）上海爲一神經過敏之都市、無經騐者不能與事實相適應者受害最大、上海燃料缺乏問題、若能獲得船隻多艘、卽可迎刃而解、然竟有人如瘋如在、因而囤積煤斤油類、實難言解、（丙）上海燃料雖缺乏、然尙未至因電力缺乏、致原枓不能製造物品之境地、</p>
<p>準備應付　新德局勢</p>

<h3>經濟業譚茶（續）</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>所謂一槍一旗，一槍兩旗，即今茶葉店旗槍」之名所由來也。及宋無名氏北苑別錄所云，較詳於前說，其言曰：</p>
<p>「茶有小芽，有中芽，有紫芽，有白合，有烏蒂，不可不辨。其小如鷹爪，初造龍團勝雪白茶，以其芽先决蒸熟，置之水盆中，剔取其精英，僅如針小，謂之水芽，是小芽中之最精者也。中芽，古謂之一槍旗是也。紫芽，芽之紫者也。白合，乃小芽有兩葉抱而生者也。烏蒂葉之蒂頭是也。凡茶以水芽爲上，小芽决之，中芽又次之，紫芽白合烏蒂，皆在所不取。使其擇焉而精，則茶之色味無不佳。萬一雜之以所不取，則質有不勻，色濁而味重矣一。</p>
<p>宋代貢茶，範以銀型，鏤以龍紋，與今之茶磚札似。宋人亦謂龍井茶之所以佳，蓋爲有龍井泉水浸潤之　。凡茶葉生在氣候溫和，空氣潮潤之山地最宜，允以野生茶爲尙，故山上多雲霧，所產茶無不佳，有雲霧之目。閩浙湘鄂皖贛無不產，然爲茶農不講究製茶術，茶商貪近利而攙雜着色，於是洋人將茶栘植於錫蘭台灣各地，然而採製雖精，但天時地利不可更，故色香味仍以中國茶爲佳，華茶所以不絕跡於世界市塲者，爲其得天獨厚；然若以得天獨厚，乃至自甘墮落，不知振拔，則良產佳品，終有毀沒之日也，可不懼哉！</p>
<p>相傳碧蘿春，爲太湖中洞庭東山產，本名「嚇殺人」，蓋鄉姑採茶，隨擷隨納之胸懷中，茶芽經胸膛偎熱，忽而異香觸鼻，茶女出不意，不覺驚異而呼「嚇殺人」，嚇殺人者，吳下驚異之詞也。及淸聖祖康煕年間南巡至蘇，時蘇撫爲宋犖，扈駕遊太湖，見漁夫網魚，亦下網得大魚，喜甚。及登東山，以茶獻，飲之甘，詢何茶，曰，嚇殺人，聖祖以其名不佳，乃名之曰碧蘿春，是亦茶史中之一段小故實也。</p>
<p>談茶之書，讀唐宋以來史，皆有紀述，近人更多著作，茲不多贅。上海飲綠茶，動輒曰龍井，其實眞正龍井之茶，山僧以之餽贈餉客尙不足，烏有餘茶以應市。故市上所流行，大都改製耳！及上海淪爲孤島，淪陷區內之茶葉，俱爲日方所搜刮，商人販運，雖領有通行證，然貨至滬上，伊空手而返。自由區內之茶葉，經政府統制，沿海口岸，復爲日方所封鎖，故自香港轉輾運滬，不但物稀，亦目價貴。市上所售茶，乃皆不得眞味，質亦劣。茶商爲應市計，不得小將雜茶改製。改製之時，嘗用白蠟，以增光澤，有用蠟燭油充數，取其　故有時飲茶覺有油膩氣，初以為老虎灶之水不潔所致，及自行烹水泡茶，油膩奧味如故，方知為茶棄本身之病。再有時茶水經宿，建成褐綠色，則又爲茶葉着色過度之故。茶葉何以要着色，原爲賣塲上美觀計，取其靑翠可愛也。相傳茶葉着色，爲已故茶商朱葆　偶然所發見。官統年間，某銀行棧房第一决災，存棧之茶，受水潰，不無點黑。朱有存茶在內，乃命棧司購白粉以飾茶，棧司誤購黃粉，用以糝和茶葉內，茶色倍形美觀，於是其茶倍受歡迎，業中人訝之，旋由其棧司宜露於外，遂皆倣行。然有着色過度，茶汁過黃過綠，引起社會驚疑，而取締着色茶，迄上海商品檢騐局成立，茶葉部分檢查，委之於吳覺農，吳習農業，而以改良茶產自任，平時多研究，曾思取締黃粉，但又不可無返色之物，乃徴求無毒黃粉，其後雖有出品，施之於茶，經久其色綠，猶未盡善也。</p>
<p>江浙間飲茶之風最盛行，有謂盛於淸初者，但觀宋耐得翁古杭夢遊錄，則知南宋時已盛行矣。</p>
<p>「大茶坊，張掛名人書畫，在京師只熱食店掛畫，所以消遣久時也，今茶坊皆然。又有一等，專是諸行借工賣技人會聚打老處，謂之市頭。」</p>
<p>按市頭，即今各業「茶會」之起源也。</p>
<p>現在市上所售之紅茶更劣，蓋紅茶更不易來滬，遂有以綠茶在滬改製；再以少許台灣紅茶作面張以欺顧客。及泡出茶汁，香味淡薄，而茶葉亦不紅不綠，蓋紅茶須用鮮葉製，綠茶改製，適成其爲「鑲紅」矣。一鄉間小茶肆，有以紅綠茶拚泡一處，謂之鑲紅。）（完）</p>

<h3>上海戲劇　學校參觀記</h3>
<p>— 李達</p>
<p>民初南通張季直、創辦伶工學校、聘由歐陽予倩主持、此爲改良科班、敎育洗禮之嚆矢、惜未數載而解體、山東戲曲學校爲王泊生所辦、戰前曾由韓復榘捐款七萬元、但設校三年、並無特殊成績、因而停辦、尙有北平戲劇學校、本爲焦菊影夫婦所辦、程硯秋仟董事長、戰前曾由北平市府、每月津貼二千元、戰後停給、以致無法維持、聞已易人繼續辦理、可見其非易易也、</p>
<p>上海戲劇學校開辦至今、雖僅年餘、但該校學生業已公演五十九决、能演唱之戲、已有五十二齣、上海人對之、不無相當印象、筆者對於平劇、雖是十足門外漢、但對於這輩學習戲劇的小天使、甚爲重視、這輩米來藝人的訓練方法、早欲一探究竟、此中或許都是他日之名伶、那末、目前該校內幕、是有參觀的價値、用特忙裹抽閑、前往訪問、</p>
<p>該校於二十年十二月七日創立、校屋本爲馬浪路貂蟬茶室舊址、不甚寬大、故而敎室僅有樓上下各一處、雖然設備簡單、但是敎師敎授頂眞、學生攻習專心、雙方溢露着嚴肅愉快的精神、這是令人嘆佩的、該校術科課目、計分生旦凈末丑文武行箱塲音樂容裝等、惟均須於每晨六時三刻點名、七時至八時四十分、男生一律練習武工、蓋武工爲男生必修科也、學生年齡、自八歲至十五歲、等於小學之學齡、即已練武、</p>
<p>繼見該校學生、莫不個個精神飽滿、活潑可喜、對於學業、皆感興趣、所以每逢公演、大家爭先恐後、所謂初生之犢不畏虎、不計難易、不顧成敗、勇往向前、多以滿足其表演慾爲能事、此亦與他校不同之現象也、</p>
<p>該校學科、計有國英算史地常識公民戲劇理論等、因側重術科、所以上課時間、不及術科之多、若就日常訓練方式、以及數十决公演成績而論、在戲言戲、可謂已具相當規模之藝校矣、社會對於昔日科班、印象不佳、但近年來之科班、並不如人言之可畏、何况學校、何况該校更非科班可比、惟在該校敎學之方式、是較普通學校爲繁重、蓋敎者學者、雙方均非辛勞不可耳、外傳體罰一節、或恐以誤傳誤、引爲揣測之詞、亦未可知、其實、任執一生而詢之、僉稱絕無其事、蓋該校學生方面、有紀律、肯服從、守秩序、富禮貌、專心攻求、耐勞不苟、無須用體罰也、</p>
<p>該校學生中、優秀良材、甚不乏人、譬如、鬚生關正明、靑衣顧正秋、花臉張正鵬、銅錘徐正鈞、小生薜正康、（廣東籍其父母爲中學敎員）、老旦朱正琴、武旦馬正鳳、花旦張正芳、武生王正堃、小丑孫正陽、武丑景正飛等、均爲傑出之材、已經在黃金大戲院公演之戲、則有四郞探母、鍾馗嫁妹、紅鬃烈馬、緹縈救父、林冲夜奔回營打圍等齣、該校校董、爲虞洽卿許曉初魏廷榮鮑和卿等、校長陳承蔭、東吳大學卒業、在滬執行律務、總務主任兪雲谷、震旦大學卒業、海上名票、以專演紅生戲馳名於時、術科敎務主任關鴻賓、曾任中國文化劇團導師、赴美表演、專任靑衣小丑等敎師、餘如瑞德寳、王益芳、穆盛樓、關盛明等、分別担任敎授、俱屬平劇名師、</p>
<p>惟該校自成立以來、十五個月、已用去十三萬元、現在尙負債七萬兀、以致設備未能盡如人意、無非欲求平劇之改進、並且造就合乎要求之新伶人而已、當世不乏提倡藝術敎育之士、宜如何加以愛護、固不待言、</p>

<h3>「副業」</h3>
<p>— 承浚</p>
<p>總理逝世紀念日，學校裹照例休假，這是我們吃粉筆灰飯者的外快假日。照理在這天應該表示哀思；但眞不知道有多少人在影戲院娛樂塲所尋歡呢！</p>
<p>我是個窮光蛋，因爲迫於生活，擔任了二個中學的國文科，以致桌上常常弁得簿卷狼藉，沒有淸理的時候。這决應該是個好機會，星期日榦掉了一百五—本，隔一天叉逢休假日，我就決心把它們完全淸埤掉，好使這一星期中得有喘息的時候。於是一早吃了點心，馬上動手，竟把餘下的一百本卷子改好，而時間還只二點鐘呢！眞使我喜川望外，我私喜我的閃電戰完成了本要一星期才可幹掉的工作。</p>
<p>這時我的身上恍如去了一付幾百斤重的擔子。我感到無限的暢快。踏着輕鬆的步子，一口氣的踱到一個小學校長的家裏。除了想探聽家鄉的消息外，同時討論討論關於近來中國政治動盪的前途。</p>
<p>但一切均出於我的意料之外，當我踏淮他的辦公室時，他第一句就問我近來做些什麼副業？這一問倒使我發怔了，敎昌還有什麼副業可做呢？我呆了半響，似乎領悟了，很得意地說：「不過寫寫稿子吧了。」「哦，寫稿子多苦，絞腦汁的工作，一篇稿子又換不了多少錢。」我聽了應到會心的微笑，因爲竟有朋友能憐憫我這種生涯呢！但是我終於向他嘆息了：「不寫稿子別的副業不會做哪。」他聽了我的嘆息，如另有所思地搖着他的坐椅，同時拿出一支烟米吸。而我呢？等待着他說出省力的副業。</p>
<p>「近來物價飛漲，隨便囤什麼貨物，一轉眼就可賺錢。你看，我道裹就囤了三千元的貨，現在算起來，已有一千五百元的賺頭。」他一面指着室內堆積的貨物；一面撥着算盤。看他眞有一種手舞足蹈的神態，臉上佈露了市儈的笑態。</p>
<p>他不說倒也罷，一說了以後，使我不覺將雙目作了一次注目的巡禮，細看他那間小小的辦公　中，香烟，肥皂，火柴，火油，啤酒以及其他的一切南北雜貨，無一不有，簡直如一間堆棧。這才使我明瞭；剛才他所謂的副業，原來就是囤積居奇的副業。我現在是跟一個市儈在談話，什麽政治社會問題，叫我如何揷入？我只好打消了我去訪問的本意，來聽　課囤積居奇的訓話。</p>
<p>我面現現着苦笑，也許是輕屑的譏笑。我對他說：「像老兄有資本方可囤貨啊！假使我有這許多閑錢來囤貨，老實講也不要埋在案頭，絞着腦汁寫稿子了。現在，救死養生尙感不暇，囤貨發財對我旣是門外漢，而且也是我不願做的。因爲我現在正吃着一百二十五元高價的米啊！」我感到說得很痛快。忽忽地離別了他。</p>
<p>囤積居奇可以當作副業，不知偷竊搶刦，賣國求榮，敲榨搜括也可以當作副業嗎？</p>

<h3>母親的命運</h3>
<p>— 秋聲</p>
<p>我很敬愛父親，我更敬愛母，有時因愛我母親而憎恨我父親，因爲他造成了母親的惡劣的命運。</p>
<p>遠在十六年前的夏季，我開始聽見人家說：父親很愛吸鴉片烟。那時我雖然只有十二歲，可是我已知道了吸雅片的害處：不但有損我父親的健康，並且可以斷送我家的幸福，以及我的前程，所以我很悲傷</p>
<p>母親平日有說有笑的臉，因爲我父親的墮落而消逝了。她有時獨自嘆氣，有時對着父親哭泣，我有時也跟着母親的哭泣而流下不少熱淚。</p>
<p>在另一年的春天，母親和一我同住在外祖母家。一個和暖一的下午，陽光照遍了大地，蝶兒飛舞鳥兒啼，宇宙間充滿了生氣。我母親那時雖還年輕，可是已好似沒有生氣了；不知怎的，又談起了父親，母親又在一個牆角裏哭泣，外祖母也在旁嘆惜：「道也是你的命運啊！……嫁好丈夫也要福氣！」這活像做戲，不過劇情太悽慘了，我被感動得又流淚了。「孩子！我現在只有希望你！」母親斷斷續續的說。「不過這個希望，又遙遙無期，而且你的命運，恐怕也根本逃不了隨着你的爸爸而轉移！」母親惟一的希望，又動搖了。「媽」！我說不出話來，眼前霎時變成了模糊一片。</p>
<p>離現在已十六年了，母親苦了十六年。據外祖母說：這是「母親的命運。」母親自己承認，這是「命」，不過她認爲：這是現在的「命運」，「命運」會跟着時間轉變的，將來的「命運」需要她後一代的人給她造成。所以她以爲：她今後的「命運」要隨着我的「命運」而轉移了。</p>
<p>母親把自己的一生，都歸根於「命運」。把自己的「命運」叉分成了三個時期，分建在三個時代的人的身上。</p>
<p>母親第一期的「命運」，我不很什細，不過據母親自己說：因爲她是女孩子，女孩子總是「別人家的人」，所以得不到父母的疼愛；不過父母保護之下，過了　十一年的較勝於婢女的生活。我母親雖然生於富裕之家，舅舅是大學畢業生，可是我母親只受了二年的私塾敎育。</p>
<p>母親第二期的「命運」，據外祖母說：因「沒有福氣嫁好丈夫」而苦惱了十多年。</p>
<p>母親第三期的「命運」，從現在起開始了，她現在正憧憬着好命運的降臨。</p>
<p>媽！你苦惱了一生！你太相信「命運」了！</p>
<h3>生命</h3>

<p>生命就是一種意識，意識是刻刻變動的，刻刻前進的，好像時間日夜不停地往前一樣。意識旣是刻刻變動，刻刻前進，那末，我們的生命也是刻刻變動，刻刻前進的了：所以生命是進化的。而這種進化是緣着變動前進，漸漸的增大，漸漸地創造的。所以，生命是創造的進化——Bergson語。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（五）愛與慾的分野</p>
<p>「打傷了人，怕沒有這樣容易放出來吧！」他捧着一柄空茶壺，慢慢地走出去，嘴裏故意用着不高不低的聲音這樣說，想讓秋海棠聽見，他明知這一位老板是決不會跟他發脾氣的。秋海棠對待手下人的脾氣固然很好，但這時候他的不和榮奎計較，却還另外有着一個緣故，那就是他心裏太高興了！</p>
<p>一個長得那麼端莊秀麗，而又具備着充分的知識和高潔的品性的女人，竟像夢幻一樣的走進了他的生活的領域中來，任何人所企求不到的慰藉，已出乎意外的降臨到一個唱戲人的頭上了。這樣的遇合，如何能够使他不高興呢？現在即使沈麻皮的手下把他所有的行頭一起扣住不放，甚至把他自己和趙玉崑一樣的關進警察局去，他心裹也滿足了，而且還可以爲他們發誓，決不怨恨他們，反要感謝他們；他永遠不敢忘記自已能够在這樣有利的情形之下，和羅湘綺見面，是完全出於他們所賜的！</p>
<p>實際上，羅湘綺對於他，不但並不會像王掌櫃媳婦之流的一見面就流露出那樣熱烈的表示，而且也沒有說過一句直接宣洩情意的話；要不是秋海棠的感覺特別靈敏，眞不會知道她已對自已發生超出尋常範圍以外的情感的。然而秋海棠却不僅已經知道，而且還確信只要照着道個方向前進，他幾年來所想望着的那種安慰，便必然可以得到了。</p>

<h3>夢中導演記</h3>
<p>— 秦士蕪</p>
<p>昨夜做了一個夢，我居然升任導演了，不可以無記。好像我已經坐在攝影塲上了，劇本是「五十年海上繁華夢」，是經理交給我的，說是一位前輩作家編的。布景是舊式的妓院，照劇本上說，是四大金剛之一的張書玉。那天拍的是上海道在院中設宴，上海道忽發奇想，要借張書玉的綠呢轎子到四馬路兜一個圈子，於是笑話百出。我細細把劇本讀了一遍，非常佩服這位前輩作家有「見識」，因爲古裝片的題材已經被人家搶光了，我又是初决升任導演，要是沒有好劇本，對於我的名譽以及以後在電影界的地位大有關係。幸虧我走了「內綫」，經理先生把這好劇本交給我；將來問世，哈哈，我還不是大導演嗎？</p>
<p>可是演張書玉的是本公司的「當家明星」，她似乎瞧不起我，演上海道的「風流小生」以及臨時演員都到齊了，她的芳蹤還小知在那里，後來劇務偷偷地對我說，祇要如此這般，包你成功。果然，我打了個電話，如此這般的來了一套，沒有幾分鐘，她的汽車喇叭聲已經在門外響了。</p>
<p>攝影　是老朋友，我先向他偷偷付了一　「關子」，譬如近景，遠景，特寫等等，不要臨時抱佛脚，討了沒趣。頂燈開亮之後，居然燈壁輝煌，在張書玉化裝的時候，我先拍了一段烏龜與做手打棚的笑話，—這是劇本里沒有的，因爲討好公司起見，才臨時想出這段絕妙的穿揷；而且爲顧全將來的輿論起見，把最近的「烏龜罷工」也爲了進去，這還不是最最針對現實的現實劇本嗎？大導演必需前進，才能兩全其美！</p>
<p>可是眞糟糕，張書玉化裝完了之後，　　　自己這雙脚懊疑起來，她高聲叫着：「這樣小的鞋子叫我怎樣穿得下？」眞的，照劇本上，不但張書玉是小脚，以及做手娘姨等等都是小脚，辦理道具的先生果然賣力，辦了許多三寸紅鞋，但是那些做手娘姨都穿了便鞋，有是甚至高跟鞋部沒有換去。我聽了張書玉的大叫一聲，別的倒不急，急的是剛才拍的一段戲里不要已把高跟鞋拍了進去。一問攝影師，他說：我早看見了，所以拍的都是中景，沒有問題。這倒提醒了我，張書玉何必一定要穿這撈什子的紅菱鞋，一切都是中景，不是OK了嗎？</p>
<p>「拍中景？上海道小是要掀起我的裙子來看小脚的嗎？」倒底是大明星，她讀劇本比我讀得仔細。這是特寫鏡頭，如果銀幕上映出一雙高跟鞋時，豈不「滑稽」乎？</p>
<p>這眞是個難問題，怎樣我第一次升任導演就碰到了這種難問題。於是祇得再同老朋友商量。他說：從前從來沒有碰到過這樣難題，而且劇本又有這末一段，不是把它删去，祗得委曲張書玉「削足就履」了！」</p>
<p>張書玉聽了，就把手里的高跟鞋投過來，正巧打在我的頭上，這一擊把我從夢中拉了回來，我不禁面孔一紅，「削足就履」倒頗有道理！</p>

<h3>US Establishes Diplomatic Policy: World Situation to See Development; Dr. Currie's Report Favorable to China; List of Needed Items Taken Back to Washington</h3>
<p>Washington: Far East experts stated yesterday that President Roosevelt's speech on Saturday evening had shed "dawn" on the process of aiding China. Experts indicated that most of Dr. Currie's report was favorable to China. Previously, some believed that Dr. Currie would submit a report unfavorable to China before returning here because the government had only recently solemnly declared its intention to aid China. Diplomatic circles once speculated that the disputes between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party would hinder American aid to China because the United States was deeply concerned that Chairman Chiang might sever relations with the Soviet Union as a result, creating a difficult diplomatic situation. Since President Roosevelt adopted a sweeping attitude to support the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and declared ("The United States has told China that it will receive our assistance"), the aforementioned unfavorable news about China has become unfounded. However, the government has not yet indicated how it will aid China. To date, the United States' attention has been focused on Britain and Greece. However, well-informed circles believe that Dr. Currie has taken a list detailing the items China needs. Well-informed circles also stated that China's position is absolutely different from that of Britain. In a few months, the situation in Britain may take a sharp turn for the worse, while China has long been accustomed to Japan's acute pressure and has no fear of it. In fact, most experts even believe that China has now launched an offensive. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: President Roosevelt's broadcast speech yesterday was warmly welcomed here. Great interest was expressed in the section concerning China. It was said that this was a new encouragement for China's war effort and that various rumors spread by foreign countries about the so-called New Fourth Army incident had been dispelled. Either the New Fourth Army has been definitively disbanded, or the international situation is better for China than before. The victory of the Chinese Air Force in the air battles over Chengdu and Wanxian on the 14th of this month can be taken as evidence of material assistance from friendly nations. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington: After President Roosevelt delivered a speech declaring that the United States would fully aid China, Britain, and Greece until ultimate victory was achieved, many believed this was one of the most important speeches Roosevelt had made since taking office and would become one of the most important documents in American history. Last night, Roosevelt hosted a banquet at the White House for members of the Press Correspondents Association and over a hundred important government officials. This banquet is held annually, and this year was Roosevelt's eighth. However, this year was the first time Roosevelt delivered such an important speech. The speech was broadcast to the world in twelve languages afterwards. Roosevelt's remarks about China's war effort demonstrated his concern and sympathy for China. When he spoke, his tone was very low, sometimes rising and falling, to emphasize his meaning. He pronounced the three characters of Chiang Kai-shek separately, somewhat like the Chinese pronunciation. When he finished the section on China, the entire hall erupted in applause. (Dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>New York: Capitals around the world, including Washington, believe that the world situation will see new developments due to Roosevelt's enthusiastic speech on aiding democratic nations. This phenomenon was very obvious yesterday. Washington officials believe that this speech is an irreversible admission of the United States' intention to defeat the Axis powers. Members of the U.S. Cabinet predict that U.S. military supplies to Britain will greatly increase. They feel that President Roosevelt has virtually guaranteed Britain's victory. Cabinet members also believe that new developments are imminent.</p>
<p>Reactions from All Sides</p>
<p>Washington's reaction to President Roosevelt's speech was initially seen as a call for unity to support subsequent U.S. policy. Their focus was on the broad scope of the speech, which aroused general interest. Diplomats and observers believe that this was the boldest speech made by an American head of state since the World War. President Roosevelt invited the residents of all occupied countries to rise up in resistance and promised that the United States would increase its aid. He offered assurances to the National Government of China under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and allowed aid to all other nations willing to resist the totalitarian powers. All of this made diplomats and government officials feel that the President had essentially established American foreign policy. Many believe that since the President delivered the speech, American foreign policy has become an indirect challenge to the Axis powers. The United States' challenge is expressed by guaranteeing full aid to China, Britain, Greece, and other countries resisting the Axis powers. London's reaction to the speech was very pleased. The British Broadcasting Corporation expressed the gratitude of the British people. The company stated that with Britain under Churchill's leadership and the United States under Roosevelt's leadership, the democratic front of both countries will stand firm. Berlin avoided immediate criticism. Reliable Roman sources stated that the speech made Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yōsuke's visit to Germany and Italy even more important. This concerns the Axis powers' stance towards the United States and is also related to the Axis' spring offensive. One Italian source believed that this speech was in fact a strong call to war, but the Axis powers would not have any strong reaction. Well-informed circles in Istanbul stated that the democratic nations have seized the initiative in the spring campaign. They also stated that as for Matsuoka Yōsuke's journey, Japan hopes that Hitler will help Japan induce the Soviet Union to sign a non-aggression treaty with Japan, so that Japan can eliminate its worries and deal with the United States. News from the capital of Yugoslavia said that political figures there firmly believe that in a few weeks or months, the United States will become a belligerent. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>US Intensifies Efforts to Obtain Defense Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Washington: Reliable sources stated that defense officials have submitted a list to the U.S. Naval Committee, listing 60 important raw materials and items to be obtained from South America, the Far East, and other places. These raw materials and items are all deemed by the U.S. Army and Navy to be necessary for defense production and are what the United States wants to obtain to prepare for stockpiling. Among them are rubber, mica, nickel, quartz crystals, etc. Well-informed sources stated that the government is currently engaged in a large-scale reorganization of shipping routes, and the aforementioned order is only part of this process. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Rumor Says Matsuoka Carries Peace Plan on Trip to Europe, Requests Pope's Aid to Mediate the Entire European War</h3>
<p>Manchouli: Foreign Minister Matsuoka and his party arrived here this morning by train from Harbin. They stayed in a hotel and did not go out. They then took a train to Moscow. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London: Certain diplomatic circles here said today that they have received news that Foreign Minister Matsuoka will lobby Germany and Italy to negotiate peace with Britain and end the European war before the U.S. lend-lease program advances. It is speculated that Japan is quite pleased with its success in mediating the Thai-Vietnamese conflict and therefore wants to try its hand again at mediating the European war. The motive for this may be partly due to the expectation that U.S. aid to China will decrease after the European war ends. (International News Service dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Algiers: French officials here said this morning that Foreign Minister Matsuoka has a broad peace plan to take to Berlin to mediate the entire European war. It is rumored that Matsuoka will strongly request Pope Pius XII's support. It is also said that Matsuoka will also ask Britain and France to cooperate to achieve its success. (International dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Aikoku Shimbun reported yesterday that only Japan's participation in the war can stop the U.S. aid to China. Therefore, Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Berlin and Rome is of greater significance. The newspaper stated that Japan feels that Britain will win due to continuous U.S. aid. Therefore, it immediately sent Matsuoka to Europe and knows that Italy may not be able to provide Japan with assistance in the Far East. Therefore, at the very least, it must have Germany help it conclude a non-aggression treaty with Russia. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Actually Advocates Bombing Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Hochi Shimbun published an opinion today urging the Japanese military to bomb the Chinese military agencies that have moved from Chinese territory to Burma. It stated that the Langwen (transliteration) aircraft factory, formerly in Yunnan Province, has now moved to Burma. In addition, the Chinese government has established other assembly factories there. American-made aircraft are assembled there and flown to China by Chinese pilots. We should not tolerate this any longer and can only recognize that Burma is now participating in the war effort. The newspaper also stated that although China and Japan have not declared war, the world has "recognized" the existence of a state of war between the two countries. Such obvious wartime activity is beyond the scope of peaceful trade and should be met with self-defense military measures. Japan has shown great patience. The newspaper also said that the consequences of this bombing should be determined by Britain and the United States themselves. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>US Builds New Cruisers, Japan Pays Close Attention</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese are closely watching the U.S. Navy's massive program of expansion and are paying close attention to the U.S. announcement that it is currently building six powerful battlecruisers. These six ships are clearly intended for long-range operations. There are rumors that Britain will exchange three George V-class battleships for several U.S. light cruisers, which the Japanese are also watching closely. (Special dispatch from the North China Daily News, 16th)</p>
<h3>Nishio Returns to Tokyo from North China</h3>
<p>Tokyo: General Nishio, the outgoing commander of the Japanese army stationed in China, has returned from North China and arrived at Tokyo Station this morning, where he was warmly welcomed. Later, Nishio met with the Japanese Emperor to report on the development of the war situation in China over the past eight months. Minister of the Army Tojo and Chief of the General Staff Sugiyama also accompanied him. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan to Implement Rationing of Grain by Head Count</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Official Japanese sources say that from April 1, rice in the Tokyo metropolitan area will be rationed per capita. This will be the first implementation since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese-Dutch Negotiations to Conclude Soon</h3>
<p>Batavia: Unofficial but reliable sources recently stated that the Japanese-Dutch trade negotiations are nearing completion. The chief Japanese representative, Yoshizawa, and the Dutch representative, Van Mook, have already discussed the progress of affairs. The negotiations will be completed in at most a few days. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Six US Warships Visit New Zealand, Stay for Three Days Before Returning to Pearl Harbor; This Trip Relates to the Situation in the Far East</h3>
<p>Washington: The Navy Department announced yesterday that six ships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, namely the new light cruisers USS Brooklyn and USS Savannah, and the destroyers USS Case, USS Shaw, USS Cassin Young, and USS Talbot, will visit Auckland, New Zealand, for three days before returning to their original defense at Pearl Harbor. The nature of this trip is a goodwill and recreational visit. The four destroyers on this trip all belong to Destroyer Division Six, and Captain Bardock is on the flagship USS Case. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Wellington: New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser announced that two U.S. cruisers and four destroyers will arrive in Auckland today and depart on Thursday. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington: After the Navy Department announced the dispatch of ships to Auckland for an informal visit, many officials secretly admitted that this trip is related to the situation in the Far East. (International News Service dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington: The U.S. fleet's visit to Auckland not only demonstrates the unity of the United States and the British Empire but also aims to support the morale of the Chinese people. This move can show Japan that U.S. warships can patrol far from their base in Honolulu. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Governor of Vietnam Decides to Send Six-Member Technical Delegation to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Sources from Hanoi relayed by Japan say that the Governor-General of Vietnam, Decoux, has decided to send a six-member technical committee to Tokyo to draft the Thai-Vietnamese peace treaty. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: According to semi-official Japanese sources, well-informed sources say that the Franco-Thai agreement (including the terms agreed upon at the Tokyo mediation conference on March 11) will be signed at the end of this month or early next month. The agreement will stipulate detailed measures for adjusting and correcting the border and will appoint a joint border survey committee. At the same time, Thailand will establish a new Vietnamese Affairs Department to manage the recovered territory. It is reported that the two districts of Hoi Sai and Bak Lay in the Plaban area will be renamed Hapri and Miglam to commemorate the commander of the Northern Army and the Prime Minister of Thailand. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: Japanese sources say that on March 15, the German Minister to Thailand visited the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs to congratulate Thailand on its restoration of its homeland in the name of the German government. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The United States Implements Lend-Lease and China</h3>
<p>At the annual banquet of the United Press Correspondents Association on the evening of the 15th, U.S. President Roosevelt, at the beginning of the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act for military equipment, delivered a solemn and majestic speech explaining the beliefs, responsibilities, actions, and determination to support democratic nations in winning the war against aggression that the United States holds in this decisive world war. In the past, although the U.S. president has repeatedly clarified U.S. policy on international affairs, and has repeatedly stated the meaning and necessity of the Lend-Lease Act, it was not entirely abstract and empty, nor was it entirely to enlighten the opposition, but its nature was only to express the wishes of those who preside over U.S. national affairs. The nature of this speech, however, is different. The President's wishes have been accepted by both houses of Congress and established as the will of the U.S. nation, and he then represented and announced this national will to the world. What is the will of the nation? In modern aggressive countries, their will is the will of their dictator or ruling class. Therefore, it must rise with the rise of the dictator or ruling class, exist with its existence, change with its change, and fall with its fall. The content of the national will in democratic countries is the interests and strength of the whole country, the direction of the whole country, and the achievements it strives for. Now, the full power of the United States has begun to advance towards its will.</p>
<p>In Roosevelt's speech, the principle of supporting democratic nations in winning the war was clearly articulated. Whether in the Far East or Europe, whether for China, Britain, or Greece, or broadly for any anti-aggression democratic nation, all are to be supported equally: the United States is not only Britain's arsenal, not only the arsenal of China, Britain, and Greece, but the arsenal of anti-aggression democratic nations. This arsenal not only does not accept orders for the sale of military equipment but generously provides guarantees for lending military equipment; it clearly provides this to China, Britain, and Greece, and equally provides it to other potentially anti-aggression democratic nations. Therefore, not only have China, Britain, and Greece received support and encouragement, but Turkey, which is already feeling the threat of aggression but is currently lingering in a neutral stage, also expressed its joy yesterday upon hearing the speech, seeing it as an overall guarantee for democratic nations in general and as a death sentence for the so-called new order. Of course, at present, only China, Britain, and Greece are qualified and expect to receive lend-lease from the United States.</p>
<p>The detailed plan of how the United States will lend its military equipment should not be immediately made public. Regarding China, last night's Washington telegram stated: It is credible that Dr. Currie has taken a list, listing the items that China needs. We certainly do not need to know the contents of China's list, nor do we need to compare China's list with that of Britain and Greece. At the same time, we understand that due to the quantity and process of production, this arsenal cannot immediately lend everything on the list at the same time. Furthermore, according to a Washington telegram, the United States believes that "China's position is absolutely different from that of Britain. In a few months, the situation in Britain may take a sharp turn for the worse, while China has long been accustomed to Japan's acute pressure and has no fear of it." Assuming that this is also the view of those in the United States who are in charge of distributing the lend-lease military equipment, we can see how the United States distinguishes between urgency when implementing its Lend-Lease Act. We firmly believe that although China is eagerly hoping for the maximum possible assistance from the United States, and is eagerly hoping for the earliest possible assistance from the United States, it will definitely not be disappointed upon hearing that the United States is supposedly giving Britain and Greece priority assistance. For what China feels disappointed about is not the present but the past. That is, what China believes the United States has missed is not the current urgent assistance to Britain and Greece. If the United States had been able to assist China in its war effort and stop aggression in the Far East after 1931, at least before the war on the Western Front in Europe, then everything would have been half the effort with twice the result. In other words, democratic nations should have adopted a strategy of defeating the aggressors one by one long ago, but should not have sat idly by waiting for the aggressor nations to try out their strategy of defeating them one by one. This is the past that has passed, and China's disappointment and the United States' mistake now only have mutual deep regret and only seek to remedy them together. Moreover, Britain and Greece are currently still in an acute illness stage. For the sake of the entire democratic front of the world, we should be impartial to China and acknowledge the urgency of Britain and Greece's need for assistance. We are confident that this is a fair and just attitude, that is, loyalty to democracy. And China is indeed confident that it can rely on its own strength to eventually bring the aggressors in the Far East to collapse, as long as the United States and British territories, as well as other democratic nations, do not continue to aid and abet the aggressors as before, and continue to supply them with even the slightest amount of materials. This does not mean that China does not need assistance. China will win. Definitive victory is only a matter of time, but the more assistance it receives, the sooner it receives assistance, the faster it will win. Therefore, it is indeed eager for the United States to assist it as soon as possible. Furthermore, it is not only eager but also firmly believes that the United States will definitely assist it as early as possible. This is because the United States' future aid to China, unlike before, is not empty sympathy, not a social courtesy of friendship, that is, it is not that it is enough to express good intentions and fulfill its personnel affairs. It wants this member of the democratic front to win a complete victory, so it must supply it with the military equipment to achieve a complete victory. Only when this member wins a complete victory will the crisis in the Pacific be eliminated and the United States' threat be lifted, and the will of the United States nation will be fulfilled!</p>
<p>Therefore, at this stage, there are two guarantees for China's victory: one is China's self-reliance, and the other is the United States' maximum assistance. With these two guarantees, what does China regret about the fact that the United States' assistance is more urgent to Britain and Greece, which are in an acute illness stage! To put it thoroughly: China is indeed materially and militarily behind Japan. If Japan does not use force to invade China and permanently maintains its superior aggressive power, then China will be permanently under its threat. If Japan changes its plans early, knows that it is difficult and retreats, and manages to maintain its remaining superiority, then China will still be under its threat. If Japan is not "dragged" by China's strategy and hastily wins or loses quickly, or now abruptly withdraws its troops and stops the invasion, then China will still have to be on alert to Japan day and night until the completion of national construction. The threat that the United States and the entire Pacific region feel is also always proportional to China's. However, if China wages a long-term war, and the United States slightly delays aid to China because it urgently aids Britain and Greece, then this is China's stability, and the stability of the United States and the Pacific. On the other hand, until now, that is, until China completes its preparations for a general counter-offensive with self-reliance or foreign assistance, Japan still grasps the last opportunity to change its course, but it absolutely does not have this great wisdom and courage. Its initial strategy was to win quickly, its current fantasy is to seek survival from death, its future luck is to return after a small defeat, and the final misfortune it will encounter is a thorough collapse after a disastrous defeat in a protracted war. From this point of view, among the priorities of the United States in assisting democratic nations, there is naturally one country that is most sacrificed, namely Japan.</p>
<p>In addition, there is something that must be said. Yesterday's Washington telegram mentioned the CCP and the Soviet Union. It was briefly stated that diplomatic circles once speculated that the disputes between Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Communist Party would hinder American aid to China because the United States was deeply concerned that Chairman Chiang might sever relations with the Soviet Union as a result, creating a difficult diplomatic situation. Since President Roosevelt adopted a sweeping attitude to support the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and declared that the United States had told China that it would receive our assistance, the aforementioned unfavorable news about China has become unfounded. This was originally unfounded speculation. The reasons for the speculation may be: or because they do not understand that this dispute in Chongqing is a military order issue and not a political issue; or because they do not understand the Soviet Union's basic view of the Sino-Japanese War, which is that in addition to ideology, the Soviet Union's "security first" concept; or because they do not understand that the CCP's conditions are relatively like this hope, not a threat from a friend or enemy; or because the Axis powers have recently launched some diplomatic conspiracies in Moscow, so they spread information to sow discord, such as the Japanese Foreign Minister hiring Germany to pass through Russia, and possibly making a cold smile and firing a cold arrow at the Chongqing dispute in Moscow. It should be known that China is fighting for independence and freedom, and for democracy. China is happy to receive foreign assistance, also for independence, freedom and democracy. China is not exploited of independence and freedom by the Soviet Union because it accepts Soviet assistance, nor is it exploited of independence and freedom by the United States because it accepts American assistance. It should be known that the Soviet Union only wants to have a China that is independent, free, and democratic as its neighbor, and does not want to have a China that is invaded and controlled as its neighbor. Similarly, it wants to have Turkey as its neighbor, and does not want its neighbors Romania and Bulgaria to be like they are today. Then, the United States' aid to China is really what the Soviet Union is happy to hear, and there is no room for doubt. As for the CCP dispute in Chongqing, not only is it far below China's national resistance and construction policy in nature and scope, so there is no need to regard it as very serious, but also the dispute occurred during China's war effort, and the Soviet Union must give consideration to the long-term security of the country first and is unwilling to change Sino-Soviet relations because of this. If this were the time of a Soviet-Japanese war, then China's prevention of the Communist Party from siding with the Soviet Union would make the Soviet Union angry. In short, at present, it is not a Soviet-Japanese war but a Sino-Japanese war, so the Soviet Union absolutely does not want the CCP to deviate from China. President Roosevelt can see this clearly, so he can declare aid to China without hesitation.</p>

Although there is no explicit provision in the Lend-Lease Act allowing for escort, and Congress has warned the President not to interpret the provisions of the Act as allowing him to escort, the President, as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, has the authority to use loopholes in the Constitution.</p>
<p>Singapore, Gibraltar: Anglo-American Co-management Possible</p>
<p>The Americans are now focusing their attention on aiding Britain and do not have time to think about Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's trip to Germany. Germany is indeed greatly exaggerating the desire to attract attention, but Matsuoka's trip will ultimately not be taken seriously. It is no longer possible for Germany to threaten the American people again and prevent them from joining the war. Hitler can declare war on the United States, but everyone expects that he will not dare to declare war publicly. After the establishment of the Lend-Lease Act, Germany is in a diplomatic predicament and is now eager to flaunt the importance of Matsuoka's trip to Europe, which only reveals its predicament. People here believe that all Matsuoka wants to do is to observe Hitler's war machine. In terms of war objectives, Britain and the United States are currently conducting cooperative talks on the future world society, and the key to the future world society will be held by the English-speaking people. Key areas such as Singapore and Gibraltar can be jointly owned, and Germany's Kiel should be the same when air force preparations are lifted. (Reuters telegram of the 17th)</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt's Speech in Full</h3>
<p>Washington - As reactions from various national capitals to President Roosevelt's Saturday speech on aid to democratic nations gradually arrive in Washington, diplomatic and political observers here are still studying the full text of the President's speech. Throughout his address, the President strongly attacked aggressor nations and firmly asserted that the United States must ensure the victory of democratic countries. The full text of the President's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>This gathering at the White House</p>
<p>for a press association dinner is a rare occasion. In the past eight years, I have always given a speech at each dinner, but this kind of gathering is still uncommon. This meeting differs from our usual bi-weekly talks because you cannot ask me any questions, and everything I say will be a matter of historical record. For eight years, you and I have helped each other. I have kept you informed of the American President's views on news from Washington, the nation, and the world, and you have kept me informed of the thoughts of our people. In our press conferences, just as at tonight's dinner, there are journalists representing newspapers and news agencies from all over. Many of these reporters are always surprised that there is still a country in the world that holds press conferences like ours. Indeed, in some countries, the freedom of the people no longer exists. In these countries, the purpose of</p>
<p>Democracy</p>
<p>like ours and the nature of our country and people have undergone serious changes. These misunderstandings of democracy are not new. I recall that at the beginning of the First World War, the German government listened to the words of its representatives in the United States, who said that the American people would never unite, that the American people valued peace more than preserving their ideals and freedom, and would seek peace at any cost, and that if the United States prioritized its own interests, it could incite turmoil and revolution. Today, we must ensure that the dictators of Europe and Asia no longer doubt our unity. Since the outbreak of this war on September 1, 1939, I have been more concerned about the future of the world than many people. The historical record shows that my concerns were not comprehensive enough. The floodwaters have now breached the floodgates. We should now reflect on the past and determine where the fault lies. History can never be rewritten with hopeful thoughts. The American people today are</p>
<p>Writing New History</p>
<p>The biggest news story this week is that we have announced to the world that our country is united, that we recognize the dangers ahead, and that our democracy has begun to move to meet the dangers. We know that Prussian autocracy was utterly vile, and we now know that Nazism is even more vile. The Nazis' intentions are not merely to change the map of colonies, nor merely to change small parts of Europe's borders. The Nazi Party has openly sought to destroy the electoral systems of all governments on the world's continents, including our own. The Nazi Party also wants to build a system of government based on the militarization of all mankind, ruled by those who seize power by force. The Nazi Party and all its hypnotized followers call this political system the "New Order." This is neither "new" nor "order," because international order refers to something that can last, in other words, a kind of</p>
<p>Justice System</p>
<p>in which mankind is willing to live for a long time. Mankind will never want to live permanently in a system established by conquerors and based on slavery. These new-style tyrants, in order to realize their plans, all want to destroy all democratic politics, to destroy the countries of Europe and our country one by one, and we do not agree with this goal. That is why we are acting today. In 1939 and 1940, the Nazis were already carrying out their plans to eliminate European countries, and they would not stop until their predetermined plans were smashed by the indomitable British defense. The enemies of democratic politics have erred in their estimates for one very simple reason. They believe that democratic politics cannot adjust itself to cope with the terrible facts of the war world. Their error lies in this. They also believe that democratic politics, because it respects human rights too much, will never be able to arm itself and go to war. They also believe that democratic politics, because it is willing to coexist peacefully with its neighbors, will not be able to mobilize its forces to defend itself, or even to defend itself. Little did they know that this belief was their</p>
<p>Mistake</p>
<p>The Axis powers, from the information they obtained from their propaganda machines, believed that conquering the United States could be achieved through "internal work," that is, not by attacking the United States from the outside by force, but by launching disruptive, divisive, alienating, and destructive morale-boosting efforts within the United States to achieve their aggressive goals. Anyone who believes that the United States can be conquered by "internal work" does not understand the history of the United States. It must be known that the United States is not a country that can be destroyed by appeasers, defeatists, and terror mongers from the back door. The United States is a country that discusses its own problems in broad daylight, so that everyone can hear these discussions. We have just engaged in a great debate. This debate is not only heard by those in the halls of Congress. Every newspaper and every radio has commented on this debate. The final solution and decision of this debate is made by the American people</p>
<p>Themselves. The decision-making of our democratic politics is inevitably slow, but once a decision is made, the person who announces this decision is not any individual, but 130 million American people. After the announcement, we are all bound by it. The people of the world should no longer doubt this fact. Our decision today is still to stop any attempts at appeasement in our country, to stop our country from colluding with those dictators, and to stop our country from compromising with those tyrants and oppressive forces. The current situation is very urgent. We firmly believe that when our production reaches sufficient levels, the democratic countries of the world will be able to prove that dictators cannot win. But at the moment, the relationship of time is extremely important. We will send every extra aircraft and every other piece of war equipment, new or old, that we have to foreign countries. This is a common-sense strategy. The major task and the heavy responsibility we bear now is to immediately transport the production piled up in factories to the front lines of democratic countries. If we can maintain our current unity, speed and efficiency can be achieved. We do not have and will never have a false unity of mankind that is threatened or seduced by propaganda. Our unity can only exist in the</p>
<p>Free Mankind</p>
<p>who can recognize the truth and deal with facts with wisdom and courage. Finally, the only guarantee of future security is that a year ago, we began to build countless factories and train a large number of talents. Therefore, when the Aid to Democracy Act was passed, we were prepared to produce based on our current planned capacity and requested an appropriation of seven trillion dollars. The text of the article itself included all of the ammunition and the convenience of its transportation. The Aid to Democracy Act was passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives on Tuesday afternoon of last week. Half an hour later, I signed it. Five minutes later, I approved an item for immediate shipment, many of which are already en route. On Wednesday, I requested an appropriation of seven trillion for new materials, and Congress quickly passed the appropriation with patriotic enthusiasm. In the meantime, what we are currently considering is speed. I hope that the word speed will soon be known to every household in the country. Each of us must make sacrifices, and the extent of the sacrifices must depend on the speed at which we act now. Tonight, I must tell you in frank terms what this move means for you and your daily lives. Whether you are serving in the military or are a steelworker, dockworker, machinist, housewife, farmer, banker, shopkeeper, or manufacturer, you must sacrifice for the freedom of the country and yourselves. In your</p>
<p>Daily Life</p>
<p>you will feel the impact of this massive effort. You will feel many inconveniences in this effort. Please be willing to earn lower profits in business, because your taxes will obviously increase. Whether you are farming or working, you must work more. I can say clearly that what the country needs to sacrifice is special rights, not fundamental rights. Most of us are willing to make this kind of sacrifice. This kind of sacrifice is for the public security and happiness of the country, for defending against the most barbaric atrocities in history, and for achieving the final victory of the way of life that is currently under serious threat. If our efforts are perfunctory, they will surely fail. This is not something that can be done by taking out a part of the time. Before this work is completed, we should put aside the concepts of "business as usual" and "business as usual." We should devote all our efforts to it, otherwise we will not be able to win. From now on, we should devote ourselves to constantly increasing the speed of production, to a greater production than we have ever known before, and to a production that never stops and never rests. Therefore, tonight, I am appealing to the emotions and reason of all patriotic men and women in our country. I ask you to consider the needs of our country at this time and eliminate all</p>
<p>Personal Opinions</p>
<p>until we achieve victory. The glory of democratic politics should be maintained forever, and everyone has the responsibility to maintain the glory of democratic politics. Individual efforts alone seem small, but it must be known that our country now has 130 million individuals. In Britain and elsewhere, there are tens of millions of people who are bravely protecting the giant flame of democratic politics from being extinguished by barbarism. The American people alone are not enough to undertake this great task. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>British Troops Enter Turkey</h3>
<p>New York - National Broadcasting Company correspondent Stanley reported to the Associated Press last night that British troops are now entering Turkey. (Associated Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Vichy - There are also paratroopers in Turkey. According to a dispatch from the Vichy News Agency in Istanbul, the Turkish Ministry of the Army announced that the Turkish Army's paratroopers will conduct exercises this week, and newly formed units to defend against paratroopers will also participate in the performance, showing that the Turkish Army has made much modern progress.

<h3>British Troops in East Africa Achieve Victory, Recapture the City of Babiira, Belgian Troops Also Occupy Asosa, Fighting in Keren Becomes More Intense</h3>
<p>London - British troops have recaptured Babiira, the capital of British Somaliland. According to a Cairo communique, the British flag is flying over Babiira on the Red Sea coast again. The city was captured by the Italians shortly after Italy entered the war last summer. However, British troops have recently been advancing from all directions and recaptured it after a rapid joint operation yesterday. British troops landed and occupied the city after effective bombardment by the air and sea forces. The communique also stated that British troops have continued to make progress in the Keren area of Eritrea, occupying several important heights. Within Abyssinia, the British Imperial forces and the Abyssinian patriotic forces are continuing to advance on all sides, causing deep unease to the Italians. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Cairo - The British Imperial forces have won a great victory in Italian Somaliland, mainly because their advance was rapid and unexpected, completely overturning the enemy's estimates. According to news received from military circles in Cairo, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in Somaliland did not dream that the British would launch an attack before the rainy season, three months earlier than expected. The Italian troops seemed stunned to see that the British troops were well-equipped and that the motor transport vehicles were moving rapidly. The Italian local troops were demoralized because they were not paid and their food and equipment were poor. In addition, the Italian side relied too much on the Juba River, believing that the river was a natural defense that was impregnable. Unexpectedly, the British troops broke through it in one fell swoop. Military officials added that, judging from the situation, the feelings between the Italian regular army and the Fascist Party members were extremely bad. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Cairo - A German High Command communique stated that Belgian troops, fighting side by side with British troops in Abyssinia, have occupied Asosa, and that British troops entering the southern part of Abyssinia from Italian Somaliland are now continuing to advance into various areas. As for Libya and Eritrea, there is nothing to report. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>London - An Italian communique today stated that the fighting in the Keren area of Eritrea has now become more intense and that Greek offensives have been repulsed. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Large British Force Continues to Enter Greece</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital - According to a British diplomatic source in Istanbul, 150,000 British troops equipped for combat have long been stationed in northeastern Thrace, less than fifty miles from German troops. It is said that another 150,000 British troops have boarded transport ships and are on their way to Thrace, with up to 10,000 troops landing in Greece every day. The British troops dispatched to Greece include many divisions of Australian and South African mechanized units. 50,000 British troops are now rushing from Haifa to join the 150,000 troops already in Thrace, forming a first-line expeditionary force of 200,000 to defend Greece and Salonika. The remaining 100,000 first-line British troops are on their way to other ports in Greece, to be used as reserve troops. (International News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>New York - The New York Times received a dispatch from the Yugoslav capital stating that, according to diplomatic sources and well-informed political and military experts there, a war in the Balkans before the summer, fought by Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, and Britain on a common front, is almost unavoidable.

<h3>Darlan Goes to Paris for Consultations on Food and Post-War Problems, Food Panic in France Is Extremely Serious, Special Courts Are Organized to Strictly Prohibit Hoarding</h3>
<p>Vichy - French Deputy Prime Minister Darlan again arrived in Paris from Vichy yesterday. This is Darlan's seventh trip to Paris and he will not return to Vichy until Thursday of this week. Darlan is in Paris to discuss with German Ambassador Abetz, mainly on the issue of the revival of the Free French Zone. Before France can guarantee that American wheat, milk, food, and meat that Britain allows to pass through the blockade will not flow into the Axis countries, Darlan must first negotiate this matter with the German side. Darlan's request that the food produced in France must supply all the French people in the occupied and unoccupied zones is a fundamental economic issue for both zones. Relying solely on the American economy and the German side not opening the occupied zone is still not enough to sustain it. Therefore, various economic and industrial negotiations are currently underway between Germany and France. (Associated Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Vichy - The food shortage situation in France is becoming increasingly serious, and merchants are secretly hoarding and raising "black market" prices. In view of this, the government authorities have decided to establish special courts to crack down on hoarding and the "black market," and later to prohibit all illegal transactions. In other words, anyone who violates the food management law, attempts to hoard, engages in illegal transactions, and raises prices from them will be severely punished by this court. In serious cases, the death penalty may be imposed. The government originally intended to treat food profiteers as criminals who have committed crimes against the state and hand them over to the military court in Caen for trial. However, because the food panic is becoming more and more serious, the government has had to set up special courts to quickly banish the "black market." This court is completely independent in the judicial and administrative system and is not subject to the jurisdiction of other courts, but is directly subordinate to the Ministry of Justice. All judges are appointed by the Ministry of Justice. The litigation procedures are quite simple, and it is not difficult to quickly judge such cases. As for the severity of the sentence, it must not only be determined by the nature of the crime, but also by the economic and psychological consequences that this type of crime may cause. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Vichy Ambassador to the occupied zone of France, Bielleyun, issued an article yesterday after inspecting various places in the occupied zone, saying that there is no question of France declaring war on Britain, but that France must adopt strict plans to seek revival when implementing the policy of cooperation with Germany and seek benefits from the difficult lessons we have learned. According to a Washington dispatch received by the Vichy News Agency, Vichy Ambassador to the United States, Hay Henry, met with US Secretary of State Hull for an hour yesterday to discuss the matter of supplying food to France. Hull claimed that he had contacted the British blockade authorities on this matter. Hay Henry later told people that the Vichy government is willing to have Americans manage the distribution of foreign food in the unoccupied zone. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Washington - Well-informed people here claim that the negotiations between Washington and London are expected to result in Britain changing its blockade measures against France. The United States is currently engaged in mediation and seems to be siding with France slightly. The US government believes that France does not need to break with Britain, so it is hoped that Britain will compromise. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Britain Will Register Men and Women Starting Next Month to Allocate Work and Serve the Country</h3>
<p>London - British Minister of Labor Bevan said in a broadcast on Sunday that starting next month, British men between the ages of 41 and 45 and women between the ages of 20 and 21 must register to take on work that is of great importance to the country. The men who register on April 5 will be those who are not employed by a certain industry. At that time, the government can find out whether they have an important profession and place those who are unemployed in a career that can serve the country. Women who register will be summoned when needed to determine whether they can serve in important national jobs. Women who have young children or have major family responsibilities will not be slightly employed. He believes that the American people will definitely be able to show their ability and determination to defeat Hitler. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>US General Motors Company Manufactures Military Equipment for the Government</h3>
<p>New York - The US government has ordered $683 million worth of military equipment from General Motors Company. The company's manager, Sloan, recently appealed to the nation to postpone the purchase of vehicles so that the factory can manufacture as much national defense equipment as possible.

<h3>British Air Force Can Control German Aircraft's Daytime Activity, British Side Expects Germany to Intensify Attacks on Merchant Ships When the Weather Improves</h3>
<p>London - Labor Party leader and Lord Privy Seal Attlee said in a speech yesterday that British-made and British-piloted aircraft defeated the German air force, which had a numerically large advantage, last fall. The British are now launching a counter-offensive against Germany with their labor and manpower, making Germany regret launching the air war. Hitler has repeatedly said that his 70 million Germans are ready to attack Britain, forgetting that hundreds of millions of British people are now voluntarily coming to Britain from overseas to fight for the cause, thus making a big mistake. Britain has Churchill and the United States has Roosevelt, both of whom are talented and far-sighted and are the same as each other. By using them to defeat the enemy, the future is indeed guaranteed. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>London - German aircraft sneaked into a town in western England last night and dropped hundreds of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs, but only a few places caught fire. There was a short-time alert in London last night, but no enemy aircraft attacked. The Aviation Department had nothing to report yesterday during the day. The German High Command announced last night that, as of yesterday, the total number of German aircraft that had been shot down by British fighters and anti-aircraft guns during the moonlight raids on Britain was. The German communique on Thursday had admitted that six German aircraft had not returned overnight, and had not released the daily losses of German aircraft since then, until last night when it admitted that twenty German aircraft had been lost in moonlight raids on Britain since Wednesday night. The British side announced that it had destroyed twenty-seven German aircraft during this period. According to a Reuters air force correspondent, in the past two days, the German public has been unaware of whether German bombers have "returned safely" because the official has not announced it. All they have seen are exaggerated British losses. On Saturday night, German aircraft attacked and fled back when the bright moon was about to rise. This was not because German aircraft wanted to avoid the moonlight, but because there was fog in Europe, which threatened to envelop their base. Therefore, the range and scope of German aircraft's attacks were limited. The loss of German aircraft's night raids last week did not exceed one-tenth, while the night activities of the German air force had to lose at least one-tenth to be seriously affected. The activities of German aircraft during the day are not the same. The British Aviation Department communique said, "Nothing to report," which shows that German aircraft have not been able to penetrate deep into the British mainland, because the British air force has taken daytime control in British airspace. When the weather improves, German aircraft are expected to intensify their daytime attacks on British ships. The British Navy's weekly communique does not detail the tonnage of British ships sunk, so it is not easy to measure whether German aircraft have succeeded in attacking British ships during the day. British coastal bombers are now also stepping up counter-attacks on enemy ships, and the coastal command's defensive weapons are being strengthened, and their strength is becoming more and more powerful. In addition, the Aviation Department announced that the British Air Force's latest Wave-type night fighters are now also being used for long-distance activities. It is known that a coastal command bomber that was previously reported missing on Saturday night has safely returned to its defense. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>London - Last night and this morning, German bombers were hampered by heavy fog and only launched sporadic attacks on the British coast. German aircraft's daytime activities over the British Isles were also hampered by fog. A city on the west coast was attacked by fire and lightning after dusk, but fire wardens quickly extinguished the incendiary bombs as soon as they were dropped, reducing the losses to a minimum. The British Air Force's activities last night were also hampered by fog, but Dusseldorf and Lorraine were still heavily attacked by the British side. It was revealed here yesterday that when German aircraft raided London on Saturday night, a Nazi bomb hit a dance hall outside the city and a nearby bus. Many dancers and all passengers in the car were killed on the spot. (International News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>British Rayon Factory Sold to the United States</h3>
<p>New York - It was revealed here last night that Britain has sold the American Valley Kos Company to 17 American banks. The company is a large rayon manufacturer and the largest British industry in the United States. The company's assets are worth $25 million, employs 18,000 people, and owns seven factories. The proceeds from the sale will be used to purchase weapons and ammunition. British Treasury Representative Sir Peacock announced the sale of the factory at the Wall Street office. Peacock said, "Because of the friendship and mutual trust between the two sides, the sale of the factory can be completed in a short period of time." Morgan Stanley Company and Dillon Lent Company are the representatives of the buyers of the factory. It is reported that the United States purchased</p>
<h3>Germany Re-establishes Consulate in Tangier</h3>
<p>Madrid - The German Consulate in Tangier, which was closed after the World War in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles, was reopened yesterday in a solemn ceremony. In the past twenty years, the building has been used as the residence of the Rabat Sultan's representative in Tangier. The house was moved out yesterday morning. Two hours later, the German flag fluttered on its roof. German and Spanish representatives were present, and a Spanish squad presented arms in salute. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Switzerland Approve Commercial Agreement</h3>
<p>Moscow: The commercial agreement between the Soviet Union and Switzerland has been approved by both governments and came into effect today. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union will exchange agricultural products, timber, and gasoline for Swiss machinery and industrial supplies. Although the Soviet Union has recently concluded commercial agreements with various countries, such as the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Hungary last December, and subsequent economic negotiations with Bulgaria, and a commercial agreement with Slovakia on December 6, and an agreement with Japan to extend the fisheries agreement between the two countries, the scope of economic negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union is even more extensive. As for the economic negotiations between the Soviet Union and Romania, an agreement has also been reached on issues of commerce and navigation. All of these demonstrate that the Soviet Union's diplomatic activities have three main objectives: (1) to establish friendly relations with neighboring countries, (2) to develop foreign trade, and (3) to develop domestic economic and industrial life. The Soviet newspapers believe that this policy is the only way to strengthen the Soviet Union's inviolable position without being drawn into the current European war vortex. It is considered "firm and wise." (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>American Train Derails, Causing Many Casualties. It is Rumored that the Accident Was Caused by Sabotage</h3>
<p>Batan: A Pennsylvania eastbound passenger train derailed five carriages last night one mile east of here. Four carriages fell into the Ohio River. Company officials claim that the accident was caused by sabotage. At least three people died, nine were seriously injured, and countless others were slightly injured. The spikes on one of the tracks were pulled out, and the bolts connecting the two tracks were also removed. Railway officials said that the wires for the electrical signals were not cut; otherwise, the signals would not work, and the train would automatically stop. The baggage car, smoking car, passenger car, and dining car all fell into the river beside the road, but were not completely submerged. Hundreds of passengers broke the windows and climbed to the riverbank. After being wrapped in sheets, they were taken to the hospital by relief trains. Eighteen minutes before the accident, the eastbound Manhattan Company train also passed over the same railway without incident. It is believed that the saboteurs' target was originally the Manhattan Company train, as that train had two locomotives and thirteen carriages, eleven of which carried passengers.

<h3>International Anecdotes (10): The Third Term of American President Roosevelt: A Daily Record</h3>
<p>Since Roosevelt has served as the President of the United States for eight years, his daily life has been more or less consistent, becoming a stereotypical routine that few can match. In his habits, there are only about three things that have changed or improved:</p>
<p>Previously, he used to swim five times a week in the White House swimming pool, but now it has been reduced to three times. He usually swims at 5:30 PM, immersing himself in the water for 20 to 25 minutes, practicing various water-based exercises to strengthen his body. Dr. McIntyre of the White House believes that since Roosevelt is already 59 years old and entering his declining years, swimming three times a week is sufficient in theory. However, Roosevelt's chest and arms are still very strong when paddling in the water. The temperature of the water in the swimming pool is usually maintained at 75 degrees. After swimming, Dr. McIntyre's assistant, George Fox, gives the President a full-body massage for about 40 minutes. This massage is still performed as usual even on days when he does not swim. Roosevelt's weight is usually maintained at a balanced weight, always between 184 and 188 pounds. In the past eight years, there have been very few times when he has exceeded 190 pounds.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt has a hobby of collecting old stamps, which he uses to relieve work-related fatigue. Sometimes he also sends stamps to auction houses. Since becoming a three-term President, this interest has diminished slightly due to busy official duties. Every day, bundles of mail are sent from the State Department to the Presidential Palace. He cuts out and keeps the old stamps. In addition, people from all over often send him old stamps as gifts. He glues them one by one into stamp albums, and a bowl of warm water is placed on his desk, in which he soaks the stamps before personally tearing them off the envelopes. He always carries a bag of old stamps and two stamp albums with him when he goes boating every week, personally gluing them in and enjoying himself. Roosevelt used to spend several hours a week on stamp collecting, but now he feels very happy if he can enjoy it once a week.</p>
<p>The value of Roosevelt's collection of old stamps has never been made public. It is said that he does not have any rare stamps, and their value is also average. However, in the eyes of most people, since he owns more than 100 stamp albums, 60 of which are kept in the White House, and several dozens in his private residence in Hyde Park, including many stamps inherited from his uncle, plus his own collection over half his life and the cooperation of stamp collecting experts from all sides for at least eight years since he became President, who would believe that his collection is just a collection of ordinary items collected in large quantities?</p>
<p>The third habit change is watching fewer movies. The White House movie room is located in a hall on the second floor, and it is screened several times a week. In the past, Roosevelt was not always present, but he was in the majority of screenings. After watching the movie, he would go to his study and work for a few more hours. This was his usual habit. Now, because he cannot spare the time, he only watches an average of two movies a month. The films in the White House are donated by various film companies' distributors and are selected in advance by Secretary O'Leary. The hall is equipped with a screen and projector, and a sound system worth US$25,000, which was installed during the term of former President Hoover. When the President is alone, reviewing official documents or answering letters in the circular study a few steps away, Mrs. Roosevelt, guests, the White House switchboard operators, cooks, and maids often watch movies there.</p>
<p>Watching movies in the White House is very comfortable. Everyone sits casually in chairs, and the walls are decorated, making it very quiet. When President Roosevelt is happy to watch a movie, he sits in the first or second row of chairs. If the movie is a light-hearted short film, then some comedy shorts are also inserted. When his wife or female elders are present, he often "cracks jokes," as the saying goes, when he encounters a film that suits his taste, making them surprised and laugh. He loves to watch newsreels or Disney cartoons. Last winter, he was greatly impressed by the famous Chaplin film "The Great Dictator" and the colorful "Red Horse Cavalry." If the film being screened does not suit his old man's taste, he will frankly "abandon it halfway." Then the black servant, Brediman, helps him up from his chair and walks into his study to rest or work, as he pleases.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's private study, with walls hung with ship maps and models, has been described earlier. His desk is full of knick-knacks, mostly donkeys. Small bookshelves are equipped with "The World Almanac," the Bible, Bartlett's "Familiar Quotations," and "Practical Standard Dictionary." The desk is also often cluttered with packets of old stamps and a box of cigars. The President himself often smokes "Camel" cigarettes, and cigars are only for treating guests.</p>
<p>Speaking of Roosevelt's reduced stamp collecting and movie watching, it reminds us of the changes in the lives of previous White House occupants. At that time, the life of the President was very leisurely and enviable. President Coolidge used to take naps for several hours in the afternoon; after President Theodore Roosevelt did three or four hours of busy work, he would spend the afternoon boxing and practicing jujitsu. Sometimes, when he had nothing to do in the afternoon, he would accompany his wife's niece for a walk in the countryside, or spend half a day in the billiard room.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt lives in the museum on the second floor of the White House. The walls inside are covered with nautical charts. On the large marble mantelpiece above the fireplace are about thirty ceramic pigs, the largest being five inches tall, gradually decreasing to two and a half inches. The tallest one is placed in the center, and the others are arranged sequentially from high to low on either side. In addition, there are photos of Mrs. Roosevelt and his old friends, interspersed with various styles of wooden and copper donkeys.</p>
<p>His bedroom is also the most casual place in the White House. The newspapers and magazines piled in the second-floor hall are often several months old. Many of the ship drawings and models he collects are often placed together arbitrarily, with no special reason to follow. Roosevelt Sr. liked to collect Christmas cards. His secretary, Ms. Lehen, kept his beloved ones in boxes labeled with the year. There are now more than 3,000 of these Christmas cards.</p>

<h3>Electricity Company Calls on the Public to Voluntarily Reduce Electricity Consumption. Yesterday, They Hosted Reporters to Explain the Reasons for Electricity Conservation, but There Is No Need to Worry as Fuel Sources Have Not Been Cut Off</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Power Company, feeling that its fuel sources are becoming increasingly difficult, has presented a plan to the Municipal Authorities to announce temporary electricity reduction measures, which have inevitably had a considerable impact on larger-scale industries and businesses. Shanghai's abnormal prosperity has dimmed, and with the unstable situation in the Far East, there is a trend of decline. Therefore, the public is confused. In view of this, the company invited Chinese and foreign reporters from the city to the company's reception room on the sixth floor at 10:30 AM yesterday, where Superintendent P.S. Hopkins gave a speech explaining the company's reasons for implementing electricity reduction measures due to unavoidable circumstances and reporting on the various steps to be taken in the future. The original manuscript was in English, and it is translated as follows:</p>
<p>No Need to Panic Within Six Months</p>
<p>There is no new news to report today regarding the fuel shortage problem. However, due to recent rumors in the newspapers that are inaccurate, you have been invited here to discuss this matter. I should report the following facts to you: (1) Even if no more fuel arrives in the future, the fuel currently stored by the Shanghai Power Company can still last for three months. (2) Under normal circumstances, the Shanghai Power Company can usually obtain sufficient coal to meet 50% of its needs. With existing reserves and new goods about to arrive, there is enough to last for six months, so there is no need to worry about shortages. (3) As the war is in progress and the number of ships is decreasing daily, fuel consumption should be reduced to prevent future problems. A decision will be made after sufficient coal reserves are obtained.</p>
<p>Public Utilities Maintain the Status Quo</p>
<p>(4) Road lights, transportation, drainage, and hospital services are related to the safety of residents' lives and should be maintained as they are. The Shanghai Power Company will never cut off the supply of electricity for these services. This should be stated clearly. (5) However, if we recklessly waste fuel or hesitate and fail to implement restrictions immediately, there will come a day when we will face the risk of running out of X-rays. (6) The Shanghai Power Company and the Public Works Department have taken the necessary steps since the first day that normal ships no longer came to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fair Distribution, Expert Research</p>
<p>(7) The various steps taken by the Shanghai Power Company and the Public Works Department are as follows: (A) Hiring industrial experts to form a preparatory committee to study methods of reducing electricity consumption and the problems that will arise for workers and capital. (B) Hiring independent economic experts and engineers to form a committee. (C) Reducing electricity consumption by 30% for large electricity users. This is a preliminary measure for future electricity distribution. Although this measure is not scientific or fair, it is the only step that can be taken before a detailed plan is determined. (D) After the committee completes its research on a fair distribution plan, important electricity users will no longer be subject to this restriction, or the restrictions they are subject to may be modified.</p>
<p>Drastic Measures May Be Taken</p>
<p>(E) The Public Works Department and the Shanghai Power Company will impose a fine of three times the excess electricity consumption on users who exceed their allocated amount. The purpose of this is purely to conserve electricity, not to increase revenue. (F) If necessary, drastic measures will be taken in future electricity distribution, sacrificing a small number of people to protect the majority. (8) The authorities have made every effort to cooperate to solve the current coal shortage problem and find ways to solve it. We have done everything possible. Since the war is in progress, it will not be possible to send ships to Shanghai in the short term. At the same time, we hope that we can voluntarily reduce electricity consumption.</p>
<p>Calling on the Public to Cooperate</p>
<p>(9) I am asking for your assistance in informing the public to voluntarily reduce electricity consumption and not to take a wait-and-see attitude. Secondly, do not interfere with or disturb the work of the committee. They are talented and are fully committed to studying this issue, hoping to meet the needs of the greatest number of people to the greatest extent. They have no time to consider private interests. They only consider general principles and can only grant exemptions or exceptions for absolutely essential businesses. (10) The Shanghai Power Company has entrusted the entire issue of electricity distribution to the committee. If the Shanghai Power Company handled this issue, it would inevitably be biased.</p>
<p>Using Oil to Generate Electricity Is Quite Effective</p>
<p>(11) The company currently has 150,000 tons of coal. The company needs 50,000 tons of coal per month. Currently, the reliable amount of coal coming in is 25,000 tons per month. The current coal shortage is 15,000 tons per month. (12) The company anticipated the risk of a coal shortage, so it used oil instead of coal. The equipment for generating electricity with oil cost about 500,000 yuan, and the results were very successful. Unfortunately, obtaining oil is just as difficult as obtaining coal. (13) It is estimated that when the electricity distribution plan is implemented, fuel will be reduced to below 100,000 tons.</p>
<p>Industrial Electricity Consumption is the Largest</p>
<p>(14) The power industry is undeniable. All we can do is try our best to conserve electricity for industrial use so that factories can continue to employ a large number of workers. (15) The Shanghai Power Company supplies 96% of the industrial electricity consumption in the Public Concession. (16) From December to January last year, the Shanghai Power Company consumed a total of 51,349 tons of coal and oil, which was distributed as follows: street lights 377 tons, Public Works Department drainage, etc. 633 tons, public utilities, tap water, telephone, tram, tap fire, public buses 2,535 tons, light, heat, electric stoves, etc. 9,700 tons, small-scale industrial electricity 5,194 tons, large-scale industrial electricity 32,914 tons, totaling 51,349 tons. It should be noted that of the 51,349 tons, 38,000 tons (accounting for 74%) are used by industry. Therefore, electricity reduction is closely related to labor issues. (17) I hope that all parties can cooperate and use electricity economically.</p>
<p>Users Can Only Control Themselves</p>
<p>(18) The difficulty lies in the fact that electricity is a "service" rather than a "commodity," so it is impossible to adopt a per capita distribution method or a centralized control method. Users can only manage themselves. (19) We cannot guarantee that Shanghai will have sufficient fuel coming in. We have reported this situation to the authorities of various countries and believe that they will assist us in solving this problem as soon as possible. What I want to report is complete. Now, I will share my opinions with you:</p>
<p>Prepare to Get Through the Restriction Period</p>
<p>(A) We do not need to worry about the current situation. We only need to prepare to get through a truly restricted period. (B) Shanghai is a neurotic city. Those who are inexperienced and unable to adapt to the facts will suffer the most. The problem of fuel shortage in Shanghai can be easily solved if more ships can be obtained. However, some people are acting like crazy people and hoarding coal and oil, which is really difficult to understand. (C) Although Shanghai is short of fuel, it has not reached the point where raw materials cannot be manufactured due to a lack of electricity.</p>
<p>Prepare to Deal with the New Situation</p>
<p>I only ask that you convey this opinion to the public, asking them to save electricity and make various preparations to deal with the new situation after electricity distribution. At the same time, limit their electricity consumption so that it does not exceed the number of degrees of electricity used by the Shanghai Power Company that they are notified of in writing. Do not let the public take rash actions or make arbitrary statements due to panic. Before the distribution of electricity plan drafted by the committee is approved by the Public Works Department, please do not request accommodation from the Shanghai Power Company and the committee by letter or telephone. Finally, I believe that all users, except for the most important services, will be subject to the restrictions of the new plan, which is unavoidable. Fortunately, there are not many of these important services.</p>
<p>Still Have a Large Amount of Coal Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hopkins, the company's fuel sources are not completely cut off, and it is still purchased every month, but the amount is limited and only enough for a portion of the needs. Kailan coal is currently the largest supplier of coal consumed. The cooperation between the Kailan Mining Company and the company is very satisfactory. It is said that they have agreed to supply the company with 25,000 tons of coal per month. He also reported the amount of coal consumed over the years, which was 50,000 tons per month in 19. At a time when the source of coal from North China cannot be normalized, and the current coal reserves must be prepared for emergency use, we urgently hope that citizens will do their best to save. He did not disclose the amount of coal reserves. Mr. Hopkins continued that the Yangshupu Power Plant is in the process of converting coal-burning equipment to oil-burning equipment, and the results are good.</p>
<p>French Water and Electricity Company Statement</p>
<p>Reporters from the Dazhong News Agency also visited the French Water and Electricity Company. According to company staff, there have been many misunderstandings in the outside world after the company announced its measures to restrict the supply of electricity. For example, it was said that the electric hair dryers in barber shops and the electric fans and electric lights advertised in households would be prohibited. Residents, not understanding the truth, have been asking questions. In fact, the restriction on electricity consumption only applies to those who consume more than 500 degrees per month. Users below 500 degrees are temporarily not restricted. It is extremely rare for barber shops and general stores to use 500 degrees of electricity. It was also said that the main target of this measure is still users who consume between 2,500 and 10,000 degrees per month. There are fewer than 50 of these users, but they are the largest customers of the water and electricity company.</p>
<h3>Remarkable Achievements in China's Economic Construction</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post stated that since Weng Wenhao took charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of China, it has made considerable achievements in strengthening various government enterprises, encouraging and assisting commercial factories and mines, developing the rural economy, and managing general economic affairs. It is said that the 26 factories and mines operated by the government last year all had considerable profits. The second important task of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is how to promote and assist private enterprises. From the outbreak of the war until the end of 1938, the Ministry was busy assisting 300 private factories and mines to move from the coastal areas to the interior. As of October 1939, 234 factories had resumed operation in the interior with its assistance. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has spared no effort in promoting the increase in various production volumes. The production of coal, iron, and steel has increased. Regarding the development of the rural economy, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has made every effort to increase the production of grain, clothing, and other export goods. This situation is most evident in Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces. In addition to providing technical, transportation, and marketing assistance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has also tried to implement rural loans. The benefits to the rural economy are not superficial.</p>
<h3>Coffin Makers' Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>The carpenters who specialize in making coffins in Shanghai used to organize the Fangzu Guild Hall. There were many workers from both the North and South Cities, scattered in various guild halls, public offices, and funeral shops. This time, due to the sharp rise in rice prices and high cost of living, the wages earned by the workers every day were not enough to support their families. Therefore, last month, the workers elected representatives to gather and discuss, demanding that the capitalists, various guild halls, public offices, and funeral shops increase wages and rice subsidies to maintain their livelihoods. It is now learned that the guild hall representatives Ji Wenliang, Xu Yuchang, Jin Fuqing, Jin Jisheng, etc., invited more than 100 capitalists, pushed out representatives Fa Maochang, Lian Dexing, Sun Rongji, Li Bingsheng, Xie Sheng, Qian Zhengqing, Guang Wanfu, Yao Dexing, etc., at 2:00 PM on the 8th of this month, in the Fangzu Guild Hall. As a result of the sincere discussion between the representatives of labor and capital, the workers in both the North and South Cities were allowed to increase their wages by 60% from the 15th of this month. There should be no discrepancies. The two sides mutually abide by the agreement. Regarding rice subsidies, both the North and South Cities will uniformly calculate according to the agreed price of 14 yuan per stone last year. There should be no more changes. After the terms were agreed upon, the two sides immediately passed the resolution and signed a contract, which was distributed as a notice for all guild halls, public offices, funeral shops, etc. to abide by and implement. The strike was peacefully resolved.</p>
<h3>Irish Residents in Shanghai Celebrate National Day Yesterday: Wreath-Laying Ceremony at the Peace Statue in the Morning; British Ambassador and Others Attend Luncheon Banquet</h3>
<p>British and Irish residents in Shanghai commemorated St. Patrick's Day (Irish National Day) yesterday (the 17th). At 8:00 AM, Mr. Craig, President of the St. Patrick's Society of this city, led the members in laying a wreath in front of the Peace Statue on the Bund in the misty rain, as per tradition. Afterwards, the group proceeded to the Jing'an Temple Cemetery to lay wreaths at the graves of five soldiers of the Irish Royal Ulster Rifles of the British Army who died during the Shanghai battle in 1937. "A" Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps also dispatched a small detachment to lay wreaths at the cemetery.</p>
<p>Grand Ball Suspended</p>
<p>In previous years, the Irish residents in Shanghai would hold a grand ball on St. Patrick's Day. This year, due to the war situation, the ball, and other events, were cancelled to conserve resources. Only a luncheon banquet was held at the Shanghai Club at noon, with a large number of guests attending. Those present included the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Consul-General George, and representatives from various foreign residents' associations in Shanghai.</p>
<p>American Officials Attend Banquet</p>
<p>American officials who were invited to the banquet included Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Patrol Fleet, U.S. Consul General Lockwood, U.S. Judge Advocate General Helmick, and Colonel Baker, Commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment. At 8:00 PM last night, Mr. Craig, President of the St. Patrick's Society, gave a speech on the XCDN radio station, stating that the purpose of the Shanghai St. Patrick's Society is to promote connections and friendship among Irish residents in the Far East and to provide relief to impoverished residents.</p>
<h3>"Special Police" Took Over Jurisdiction of the Western District Yesterday Morning: Traffic Control Also Taken Over</h3>
<p>The establishment of the "Special Police Force" in Western Shanghai, which had been widely publicized, was realized at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 17th). The Shanghai Municipal Council's police constables and the "Municipal Police" all withdrew from the road area outside the boundary at that time, and the "Special Police Force" completely took over. There was no commemorative ceremony when the jurisdiction of the Western District was handed over yesterday morning. After the smooth handover, traffic control and other police work were taken over by the "Special Police." "Deputy Chief" Christer published a brief statement yesterday morning, saying that the "Special Police Force" has officially taken over all jurisdiction in the Western District. Once the arrangements are finalized, a formal commemorative ceremony may be held. The "Special Police Headquarters" is located at 57A Great Western Road.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador to China, Baron Guillaume, Will Arrive in Shanghai: Will Stay for Three or Four Days Before Proceeding to Chongqing; Wife, Sons, and Daughters Will Remain in Beijing</h3>
<p>Belgian Ambassador to China, Baron Guillaume, has been in Beijing for more than three months since leaving Shanghai in mid-December last year. Because of the extremely cold weather in Beijing, the Ambassador remained at home most of the time, except for handling daily official duties. Now that the earth has revived in spring and the scenery of Jiangnan is especially charming, the Ambassador will depart from Beijing for Shanghai in the coming days, arriving in the city around the 22nd or 23rd. The purpose of this visit is to inspect the embassy affairs and to visit friends. However, the stay in Shanghai will be very brief, only three or four days. The Ambassador will then proceed from Shanghai to Chongqing, as he has been away from Chongqing for a long time and may have become estranged from important figures in the central government. Therefore, he is taking advantage of this bright spring weather to visit Chongqing on a friendly basis, to strengthen the friendly relations between China and Belgium. The length of stay in Chongqing will depend on the complexity of the affairs. It is said that after the Ambassador completes his official duties in Chongqing, he may return to Shanghai for a short stay. However, the Ambassador's wife, sons, and daughters will remain in Beijing and will not accompany the Ambassador.</p>
<h3>Effective Action Should Be Taken to Curb Rice Hoarding: French Authorities Negotiating to Add More Rice Transport Ships</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Municipal Council's Food Committee has reportedly formulated appropriate measures to curb rice hoarding and speculation and will submit them to the Municipal Council Board of Directors for discussion at its regular meeting on Wednesday. Given the general public's anxiety about the rice situation, it is expected that the authorities of the Public Concession will cooperate with the French Municipal Council to formulate several effective remedies.</p>
<p>Rumors of Possible Price Increase</p>
<p>It is also rumored that the Rice Evaluation Committee is now planning to increase the official fixed price of rice to effectively deal with black market speculation. It is reported that the committee will meet on the 18th to study this proposed measure. Observers say that since the official fixed price is maintained at the current low level, rice merchants sell rice to customers willing to pay the price they demand, rather than according to the prescribed fixed price, explaining the official price yesterday (the 16th).</p>
<p>French Authorities Expediting Rice Transport</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th), the French Concession authorities, to prevent food shortages within the concession, asked Saigon to facilitate the transport of rice already purchased to Shanghai. It is reported that the French authorities have also asked the French shipping company to add more ships to transport rice to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Some Rice Shops Stop Selling Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Currently, some rice shops within the concession refuse to sell foreign rice at the door, causing the common people to suffer even more. When the reporter interviewed a rice shop owner yesterday to inquire about the reason for the suspension of sales, he said that one reason was the lack of rice supply in the rice shops. Another reason was that the underground discounting was so rampant, increasing the cost of purchase. If the transaction exceeds the limit, it would violate previous resolutions and the authorities' prohibitions. If sold at the fixed price, there would be a loss. Therefore, some businesses have temporarily suspended operations and are requesting the rice shop association to submit a request to the concession authorities for clarification. It is also learned that the Rice Shop Association plans to reorder 15,000 bags of foreign rice to be sold on the market and is currently registering.</p>

The company will send out several personnel within the week to notify various stores and institutions of the amount of electricity they can use.</p>
<h3>Robbery Log</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a pedestrian named Mr. Jia was carrying a large sum of money when he passed the intersection of McTaggart Road and Wuding Road.

<h3>Old, Sick, and Addicted to Opium: Thugs Break In and Extort Money, Stealing Opium Pipe and Ransom Money: One Woman Arrested, Two Robbers Escape</h3>
<p>Li Huizhang, a Cantonese man, is 72 years old. He used to work as a dyer at the Municipal Council, but he retired due to old age and illness. He lives at No. 105, Lane 546, Tiantong Road. He is deeply addicted to opium and spends his days lying in bed, smoking. A Cantonese woman named Huang Zhangshi, because she and Li are from the same hometown, often visits Li's home and occasionally helps Li prepare opium. At around 2:00 PM on the 11th of this month, two men he did not know, Chen Xuelin and Huang Lianghua, suddenly broke into Li's home and took away an opium pipe, instructing him to redeem it for 100 yuan at the Haining Village Tea House on Quanhai Ning Road. Li reported the incident to the Wusih Police Station and requested an investigation. The day before yesterday, Huang Zhangshi brought Cai Wang and two others to Li's residence and demanded 60 yuan. Li reported the incident to the police station again. Detective Hu Guangrong and Yang Jinchen were dispatched to arrest her. Cai Wang and two others escaped. They were taken to the police station, where it was learned that the opium pipe had been pawned at the Jinan Pawnshop at 517 Haining Road for 22 yuan. The opium pipe was then redeemed. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Peng Qiqi filed a lawsuit according to law. After being questioned by Judge Dai, he pointed out that Li's opium use was also a violation of the law. He ordered Huang Zhangshi to be detained for sentencing on the 28th. The opium pipe is temporarily held at the police station.</p>
<h3>Hu Zhaolin Shot and Killed in Front of the Great World Department Store Last Night: Man in Suit Shoots Him, Hitting Him Twice and Killing Him Instantly</h3>

At approximately 10:00 PM last night, Hu was walking from north to south on Yu Xiaqing Road when he passed in front of the Great World Department Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road. Suddenly, a man wearing a suit emerged from the crowd, took out a pistol, and fired two shots at Hu Zhaolin, both hitting the back of his head.

<h3>Food: Raising a Tiger Can Be a Threat: Hoarders Refuse to Display Samples: Foreign Rice Arrives in Shanghai in a Steady Stream, with Another 40,000+ Bags; Not Enough to Stir Hoarders, Daring to Intend Coercion</h3>
<p>Hopes for a clarification of the increasingly deteriorating atmosphere surrounding foreign rice rose at the end of last week. Shanghai has a lot of foreign rice, enough to feed millions of citizens for more than half a year. How could there be any fear of shortages? The sources are coming in an endless stream. Seventy or eighty thousand bags that had arrived were already being unloaded, and two or three more ships were newly arrived waiting to be unloaded. The market price should be small or not small, is this not an obvious phenomenon of monopoly manipulation? The morning market yesterday was still stable, but then large households, dealing with the bureau's accusations, did not go to the market to display samples, and did not even display samples outside the market. Many floating households then hoarded and raised prices, and the market immediately became tense again. Xiaowen rice, which was traded the most, was pulled up by two, three, or four yuan. Saigon broken rice was also taken up. Xiaojiao's initial price was 3,300 to 3,400 yuan per hundred bags, followed by as much as 3,700 yuan. The premium for No. 1 Neigong was 2,900 yuan and 3,000 yuan, and the premium for No. 2 was 3,300 to 3,400 yuan. No. 1 Saigon's original package was 108 and a half yuan, broken rice was 85 yuan per shi, and second-grade was 80 yuan. However, new transactions included Laogongmao selling 200 tons of No. 1 Saigon road goods at a price of 120 yuan per bag, and Heyi Foreign Bank selling 3,300 tons of Xiaojiao for delivery in late April and early May at a price of 126 yuan per bag. There are currently eight or nine thousand bags of foreign rice, both in bulk and packaged. With such behavior, the rice hoarders are trying to use the trick of controlling food. Allowing them to hoard shows that raising a tiger can be a threat, reaping what you sow.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai is very strong. The French ship G.G.A.Varenne, managed by Hualun Foreign Bank, arrived in Shanghai directly from Saigon with 30,500+ bags of foreign rice, according to the scheduled shipping date, on the 16th (Sunday), and docked at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong to unload. On the same day, Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived from Hong Kong with 2,168 bags, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession to unload. Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng ship also arrived in port on the 16th, also bringing 8,118 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload. (Zu)</p>
<p>After the thick and thin japonica and other national rice varieties returned to fatigue the week before, they were even more exhausted yesterday due to the relatively large number of sources. Not only was the guest's acceptance not good, but the general owners' willingness to sell also loosened, so the price continued to be difficult to stand, and the depreciation continued by two or three yuan. For example, Changbang Hubei japonica opened at 126 yuan to 124 yuan, Kunshan Hubei japonica at 122 or 3 yuan to 120 yuan, and Qingjiao Hubei thin rice at 117 yuan, eventually dropping to 115 and a half yuan.</p>
<p>Because both buyers and sellers were wary of the black market rumors of foreign rice at this time, fearing that drastic changes would suddenly arise, and the subsequent impact was difficult to predict, both did not dare to venture in and out, so there were few transactions and the market price did not change. Similar to before, Hong Kong Baiyuan special grade still opened at 108 yuan, eventually settling at 104 yuan, and glutinous tea was at 98 yuan and 97 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Tapioca Flour Begins to Calm Down</h3>
<p>The tapioca flour market has entered a calm phase. The tapioca flour transshipped from Hong Kong is shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream, and Kanmei flour is repeatedly scheduled to open, making it difficult to boost people's spirits. The actual sales in this street are still supplied by Fuxin Factory with more than 5,000 bags of medium-selling flour, with no additional needs. Therefore, both local and foreign transactions have become flat, and the unified market price for selling Kaifeng Bird Tower brand is 32 yuan, 5 jiao to 5 jiao and a half, Jinlong brand is 31 yuan and 5 jiao, slightly higher than the end of last week.</p>
<p>The wheat market is still quiet. The source of inland Dumai wheat has been cut off. The foreign wheat that has arrived is being supplied by Fuxin Factory for flour production at a fair price. Fufeng Factory has stopped due to lack of wheat, so the Chinese factory has no business at all, and there is no cargo to buy at the Japanese factory store. The market is still at a standstill.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Futures Oil Falls Back Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains, oil, bean cakes, and etc. did not undergo much special change. However, because the spot market for futures soybean oil was bleak, many people in the industry were bearish, so the company organization sold with all its strength, and the interest in suppressing the market was quite strong. However, the activity of non-industry hoarders and buck-passing retail investors was quite strong, so even though there were several falls, they were forcibly recovered. The market was slightly quieter yesterday, and as a result, it was about two yuan less than the end of last week. Spot prices still have a slight difference. A total of 100 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil was traded, with a price of 100 yuan. There were 200 barrels of Dalian spot oil, with a price of 134 yuan to 33 yuan and 5 jiao, and 600 barrels for delivery in early April, with the price falling from 137 yuan and 5 jiao to 135 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen. Today, there were 240 bags of exported soybeans, 200 bags of peanuts, 100 bags of sesame, and 200 cans of sesame oil, all shipped to Hong Kong, and 50 bags of soybeans shipped to Haikou.</p>
<h3>Finance: More Import Bills Settled: Exchange Rates for British and American Currencies Continue to Be Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's official rate was announced at 9:30 AM: British exchange rate was 3 pence 25, American exchange rate was 5 yuan 315, both reduced by 0.0625. There was no market for French or German currencies, and other exchange rates also decreased. The underground market for British and American exchange rates also softened due to the import rush. The tightest British gold this month only settled at 3 pence 296875, and the American exchange rate sold for 5 yuan 375. Until noon, speculators stopped the rush to buy, and the American dollar this month once sold as high as 5 yuan 4375. Although speculators sold in the afternoon, the rush to buy for imports was even better, and the potential softened again. Ultimately, British gold was at 3 pence 296875, and American dollar at 5 yuan 375, both tightly at 0.03125. Transactions were quite brisk.</p>
<p>HSBC Official Rate Also Decreases</p>
<p>Since the Central Official Rate this morning did not change, foreign telegraph prices for British and American currencies had no changes, and Indian silver was flat for both spot and long-term futures. The exchange rates of various countries for the American dollar were 2 cents lower for Shanghai, and the rest were flat. The opening price of silver in the domestic market was for the selling price. The spot prices were British gold at 3 pence 328125, American dollar at 5 yuan 40625, and the Russian exchange rate softened to 3 pence 3125 for British gold in March and 5 yuan 40625 for American dollar this month, all bank buying prices. The hanging price of exchange rates also decreased, and the silver balance tax was still slightly at 24.50%. Later, it was suddenly heard that an importer came to rush to settle the March British gold at only 3 pence 3125, and speculators came to rush for the April American dollar at 5 yuan 40625 and 5 yuan 375. By 10:45, foreign banks suddenly offered better terms, and speculators also turned to selling, with this month's American dollar actually reaching 5 yuan 4375, turning firmer. The noon closing prices were British gold at 3 pence 3125 and American dollar at 5 yuan 40625.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Continuously Absorb</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, the foreign banks initially absorbed the March American exchange rate again at 5 yuan 40625 due to speculators continuing to release it. Later, the market softened again because foreign banks started to absorb settlements again. The March and April American exchange rates were priced at 5 yuan 375 and 40625, and it was difficult to supply them. The evening closing prices for spot and near- and long-term futures were British exchange rate at 3 pence 296875 and American exchange rate at 5 yuan 375, both reduced by 0.03125 compared to the closing prices on Saturday.</p>

<h3>Economic Discussions on Tea (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>The so-called "one spear, one flag" or "one spear, two flags" is the origin of the names "flag spear" used by tea shops today. The *Beiyuan Bielu* by an anonymous Song Dynasty author provides a more detailed explanation than the previous one, stating:</p>
<p>"Tea has small buds, medium buds, purple buds, white-combined buds, and black-stemmed buds, which must be distinguished. The small buds, like eagle claws, are used to make the finest Dragon Ball and Snow White teas. These buds are picked first, steamed, and placed in a water basin, where their essence is extracted, as small as needles, and called 'water buds,' the finest of the small buds. Medium buds are what the ancients called 'one spear, one flag.' Purple buds are buds that are purple. White-combined buds are small buds with two leaves that grow embracing each other. Black stems are the stems of the leaves. Of all teas, water buds are the best, followed by small buds, then medium buds. Purple buds, white-combined buds, and black stems are not desired. If they are carefully selected, the color and flavor of the tea will be excellent. If any of the undesirable parts are mixed in, the quality will be uneven, the color will be muddy, and the taste will be heavy."</p>
<p>During the Song Dynasty, tribute tea was molded with silver molds, engraved with dragon patterns, similar to today's tea bricks. Song people also believed that the reason Longjing tea was so good was that it was moistened by the Longjing spring water. Tea leaves grow best in mountains with mild climates and humid air, with wild tea being the most prized. Therefore, mountains with frequent clouds and mists produce excellent tea. Tea is produced in Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces, but because tea farmers do not pay attention to tea-making techniques, and tea merchants are greedy for quick profits and mix in coloring, foreigners have transplanted tea to Ceylon and Taiwan. However, although the picking and processing are exquisite, the timing and geographical advantages cannot be changed, so the color, aroma, and flavor of Chinese tea are still the best. The reason why Chinese tea has not disappeared from the world market is that it is uniquely blessed by nature. However, if we rely on this advantage and become complacent, without striving for improvement, then even the best products will eventually be destroyed. Should we not be afraid of this?</p>
<p>It is said that Biluochun tea, produced in Dongting East Mountain in Tai Lake, was originally called "Scare the Person to Death." It is said that village girls picking tea would pluck the buds and place them in their bosom. The tea buds, warmed by the chest, would suddenly emit an unusual fragrance, startling the tea girl, who would exclaim, "Scare the Person to Death!" "Scare the Person to Death" is a term of surprise in the Wu dialect. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, when he made a southern tour to Suzhou, the governor of Suzhou at the time, Song Luo, accompanied the emperor on a tour of Tai Lake. He saw fishermen catching fish and also caught a large fish with their nets, which pleased him greatly. When they ascended Dong Mountain, they offered tea. He drank it and found it sweet. He asked what kind of tea it was, and they replied, "Scare the Person to Death." The emperor, finding the name unpleasant, named it Biluochun. This is another small anecdote in the history of tea.</p>
<p>Books discussing tea, from the Tang and Song dynasties onwards, all contain records. Recent people have written even more books, so I will not go into detail here. In Shanghai, when drinking green tea, people often say "Longjing," but in fact, the real Longjing tea is not even enough for the monks to give as gifts to guests. How could there be any leftover tea for the market? Therefore, most of the tea circulating in the market is remanufactured! When Shanghai became an isolated island, the tea leaves in the occupied areas were all seized by the Japanese. Even if merchants had permits, they would return empty-handed after delivering the goods to Shanghai. The tea leaves in the free areas were controlled by the government, and the coastal ports were blocked by the Japanese, so tea had to be shipped from Hong Kong, making it not only scarce but also expensive. The tea sold in the market was not the real thing, and the quality was also poor. To meet market demand, tea merchants had to remanufacture miscellaneous teas. In the process of remanufacturing, they sometimes used white wax to increase the luster, or even used candle oil, to give it a sheen. Therefore, sometimes when drinking tea, one would notice a greasy taste, initially thinking it was due to the unclean water from the public water boilers. However, when brewing tea with one's own water, the oily and unpleasant taste remained, and one realized that it was a problem with the tea itself. Sometimes, tea water would turn a brownish-green color overnight, which was due to excessive coloring of the tea leaves. Why is tea leaf colored? Originally, it was for aesthetic reasons in the market, to make it look green and appealing. It is said that tea leaf coloring was accidentally discovered by the late tea merchant Zhu Bao. During the Guangxu reign, the No. 1 warehouse of a certain bank caught fire, and the tea stored in the warehouse was flooded with water, resulting in some blackening. Zhu had tea stored there, so he ordered the warehouse staff to buy white powder to decorate the tea. The warehouse staff mistakenly bought yellow powder and mixed it with the tea leaves, making the tea color even more beautiful. As a result, the tea was very popular. People in the industry were surprised, and the warehouse staff revealed the secret, so everyone followed suit. However, excessive coloring, resulting in tea that was too yellow or too green, caused public suspicion, and the practice of coloring tea was banned when the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau was established. The tea inspection was entrusted to Wu Juenong, who studied agriculture and took it upon himself to improve tea production. He usually did a lot of research and considered banning yellow powder, but a coloring agent was still necessary. Therefore, he sought out non-toxic yellow powders, but although some products were eventually produced, they turned green after prolonged use in tea, so they were not entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>The custom of drinking tea is most prevalent in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, said to have flourished in the early Qing Dynasty. However, reading Nai Deweng's *Guhang Mengyoulu* from the Southern Song Dynasty, we know that it was already prevalent at that time.</p>
<p>"Large teahouses hang paintings and calligraphy by famous artists. In the capital, only hot food restaurants hang paintings, to help customers pass the time. Now all teahouses do the same. There are also places where people from various trades gather to play games, called 'market heads.'"</p>
<p>The "market head" is the origin of today's "tea gatherings" of various trades.</p>
<p>The black tea sold in the market now is even worse, as it is even more difficult to get black tea to Shanghai. Therefore, some people remanufacture green tea in Shanghai, and then add a little Taiwanese black tea on top to deceive customers. When brewed, the tea soup has a weak flavor, and the tea leaves are neither red nor green, because black tea must be made from fresh leaves. Remanufacturing green tea turns it into "red-trimmed" tea. (In small tea houses in the countryside, red and green tea are sometimes mixed together and called "red-trimmed.") (The End)</p>
<p>Tianjin's British and American Currencies Are Tight</p>
<p>Tianjin, 17th (Weekly) Dispatch: The foreign exchange market opened tight this morning. London telegraphic transfers were down to 0.625, a decrease of 3 pence and 625 points. New York telegraphic transfers were reduced to 115, or 5.9375 yuan. Shanghai exchange rates rose 50 cents, to 90.05 yuan. "United Notes" remained stable in the unofficial market, still at 75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Rise Still Slight</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw fluctuating spot prices. British and American gold pounds fell and then recovered. British gold notes had slight demand, and spot prices rose slightly. The American dollar once rose to 18.435 yuan, a rise of 10 cents from Saturday. Hong Kong notes rose by 2 cents following the rise in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. Japanese and Korean gold notes continued to rise, with spot prices continuing to climb, the former rising to 1.944 yuan and the latter rising to 1.60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Rise, But Slowly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market in both the spot and unofficial markets shrunk due to the soft foreign exchange rates settled by foreign firms. Most people were bullish, but one large player took profits at a high point, causing the price to fluctuate despite rising again. Xinhua, a Hong Kong and Taiwan exchange dealer, sold short, pushing the price down to 6,398 yuan. However, this was fleeting, and the price quickly rebounded. Banks and securities firms absorbed the supply, and retail investors pushed the price up to 6,458 yuan due to tight foreign exchange conditions. At noon, the price rose with the US dollar, recovering more than 50 yuan. In the afternoon, exchange dealers bought back, and securities firms absorbed the military's selling pressure, pushing the price up to around 6,430 yuan. In the end, the price rose another 6 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was over 20,000 taels. The three-month rollover from March to April saw sellers like Xiangxing, Yongli, Tai, and Wanfeng offer 300 taels to buyers like Chengji at prices of 40 yuan and 38 yuan. Cash was initially flat. In the morning, Tianyuan and Yida each offered 50 taels to Tiancheng, and then Tianyuan offered another 400 taels, while Shihe offered 30 taels, all of which were bought by Jundefu at a price 350 yuan higher than the futures price. In the afternoon, Chengda sold 20 taels to Wengyuan at 315 yuan higher, and then sellers offered at 310 yuan higher, with buyers bidding as high as 290 yuan higher. Ornament gold and customs gold were both flat.</p>
<p>Taking Profits at High Prices</p>
<p>The market opened this morning at 5:15 am at 6,320 yuan per bar (ten pieces), 5 yuan lower. Chengji and Yida aggressively bought, pushing the price up to 6,445 yuan. Xinfeng and Yongshunyuan sold, causing an immediate drop. Around 10 o'clock, Dafeng, Defu, and retail investors also sold, causing a sharper decline, breaking below 6,400 yuan. Tianyuan also sold, dropping the price to 6,398 yuan, which was absorbed by Hengji, Yida, and Tiancheng money shops. Retail investors covered their short positions, pushing the price up by 60 yuan. The price then soared to 6,458 yuan on rumors that the April US dollar rate was only 5.375. Around 11 o'clock, securities firms, Defu, and exchange dealers sold, and the US dollar strengthened, causing retail investors to rush to sell, pulling the price back to around 6,410 yuan. The noon close was 7,410 yuan. The afternoon session opened at 6,420 yuan, 10 yuan higher than the noon close. The price then retreated slightly to 6,410 yuan. Xiangxing, Yongtong, Kangyong, and Laijin bought, and the exchange dealers Xinfeng and Yongtao bought back, causing a rise of 30 yuan to 6,440 yuan. Ultimately, Chengji, a gold shop, sold aggressively, causing a decline to 6,425 yuan. The closing price at 4 o'clock was 6,431 yuan, 6 yuan higher than Saturday's noon close. Based on the April US dollar futures price of 5.375, the implied price was 6,479.1 yuan, a discount of 48.1 yuan. After the close, the price rose to 6,440 yuan. The selling price of cash gold at the main brand gold shops was 310 yuan higher than the spot futures price, and the buying price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Ornament Gold Still Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at Yinlou Jewelry remained at 690 yuan at Datongxing and Xintongxing (buying price minus 40 yuan), it is said.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds See Stronger Gains</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for government bonds saw strong upward momentum yesterday. A large player suddenly took profits in the afternoon, causing a slight pullback, but the final result was still higher than the previous week. Since the return of Special Envoy Corlett to the United States, prospects for aid to China seem increasingly uncertain, so although large players sold government bonds, the market price did not fall much, indicating that most buyers are investors. The current spot market is extremely tight, and it is not easy to force the market down, even under pressure. Yesterday's trading saw many purchases in the morning, with Category C bonds breaking through 6 yuan. Xiexingyuan, Zhongyi, Hu Heji, Hengkang, Datong, and Xinhua all absorbed a large amount. Although Jiufu, Xieda, Yichang, and Lianhe sold, the market price gradually rose, with Category C closing at the highest price of 6.65 yuan. In the afternoon, Lianhe suddenly bought a large amount, as much as 700,000 or 800,000 yuan. Xiexingyuan, Lianyi, Shunchang, and Renchang also showed considerable interest. The high price of Category C was close to 7 yuan, but Hongda, Tongkang, Jiufeng, Datong, and Xiekang sold off, pushing the market down by 400 cents. The results, except for a slight decrease of 15 cents for Category D, all rose by 50 to 80 cents. The total volume traded was around 2.4 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhongyi Trust were traded at a price of 15.5 yuan, and 100 shares of Huashang Electric were traded at a price of 7.85 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market at the Public Industry Association was remarkably strong throughout the day due to generally good news and optimistic sentiment. Jardine Matheson rose to the original price before the dividend was paid at the close of last week. Union Insurance and Jardine Matheson also rose sharply. Industrial stocks saw a huge volume of transactions, and most rubber stocks also rose.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Short Positions Increase, Cotton Yarn Fails to Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, and the situation returned to a state of flux. Although there were no large-scale developments in actual transactions by Hong Kong firms, there was a steady stream of small purchases, so sentiment remained calm. On the bullish side, due to the shrinking foreign exchange rates and rising spot gold prices, the yarn market should have risen. However, because short sellers had abundant inventory and limited sea transport, the short positions of securities firms were rolled over day by day, and the upward momentum was suppressed. The high price for 20-count Bianma yarn was 1,432 yuan, and the low price was 1,410 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 1,408 yuan. The price rose to 1,416 yuan on rumors that gold prices were still high, and finally closed at 1,415 yuan. Today, 235 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened this morning continuing the strong gains of the previous day, with the opening price at 1,430 yuan. Shortly after, it rose slightly to 1,432 yuan. Then, there were few buyers on the trading floor, and the short sellers not only did not cover but even increased their positions. This caused the market to decline to 1,411 yuan. However, foreign exchange rates opened lower, and spot gold prices rose, causing sentiment to recover to 1,422 yuan. This price level was maintained for a short time, but the buying interest did not surge. The price then fell again to close at 1,411 yuan as gold prices eased slightly. According to the half-day trading statistics, 6,675 bales were traded. The amount of purchases by each firm is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 670 | Mainland: 5</p>
<p>---|---|---</p>
<p>Other Firms: 6,000 | Total: 6,675</p>
<h3>Fine Lint Cotton is Popular</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is also stable. Factories have a slight need, but 42-count raw materials are still the most popular, while others are mediocre, it is said. The New York cotton market was initially strong due to foreign purchases and good cotton fabric sales, but then fell back due to some profit-taking. As a result, the closing price was up or down 2-3 points compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Shanghai Drama School</h3>
<p>— Li Da</p>
<p>In the early Republic of China, Zhang Jian of Nantong founded the Linggong School, hiring Ouyang Yuqian to preside over it. This was the beginning of the educational reform of opera troupes. Unfortunately, it dissolved after only a few years. The Shandong Opera School was run by Wang Bosheng, and Han Fuju donated 70,000 yuan before the war, but the school did not achieve any special results in its three years of operation and was therefore closed. There was also the Peking Drama School, originally run by Jiao Juying and his wife, with Cheng Yanqiu as the chairman of the board. Before the war, the Peking Municipal Government subsidized it with 2,000 yuan per month, but this was stopped after the war, making it impossible to maintain. It is said that it has been taken over and is continuing to operate, which shows that it is not an easy task.</p>
<p>Although the Shanghai Drama School has only been open for a little over a year, its students have already given 59 public performances, and are able to perform 52 different operas. People in Shanghai have a considerable impression of it. Although I am a complete outsider to Peking opera, I attach great importance to these little angels who are learning drama. I have long wanted to explore the training methods of these future artists. Perhaps some of them will become famous actors one day. Therefore, it is worth visiting the school to see what is going on behind the scenes. I took time out of my busy schedule to visit.</p>
<p>The school was founded on December 7, 1931. The school building was originally the old site of the Diaochan Tea Room on Rue Massenet, which is not very large. Therefore, there are only two classrooms, one upstairs and one downstairs. Although the facilities are simple, the teachers are dedicated and the students are focused, exuding a serious and pleasant spirit. This is admirable. The school's practical courses are divided into male roles, female roles, painted-face roles, male roles, comic roles, martial roles, stage equipment, music, costumes, etc. However, all students must be called to roll call at 6:45 every morning. From 7:00 to 8:40, male students practice martial arts, as martial arts are a required course for male students. The students are between the ages of eight and fifteen, which is equivalent to elementary school age, and they are already practicing martial arts.</p>
<p>I then saw that the students of the school were all full of energy, lively and likeable. They are all interested in their studies, so they all rush to perform in public performances. Like newborn calves unafraid of tigers, they do not care about difficulty, success, or failure, and go forward bravely, mainly to satisfy their desire to perform. This is also a different phenomenon from other schools.</p>
<p>The school's academic subjects include Chinese, English, mathematics, history, geography, general knowledge, civics, and dramatic theory. Because of the emphasis on practical courses, the class time is less than that of practical courses. Judging from the daily training methods and the results of dozens of public performances, it can be said that it is already an art school of considerable scale. Society has a poor impression of traditional opera troupes, but the opera troupes of recent years are not as terrible as people say. Moreover, the school is not comparable to an opera troupe. However, the teaching method in the school is more burdensome than in ordinary schools. Both teachers and students must be hardworking. The rumors about corporal punishment may be the result of misunderstandings and conjectures. In fact, if you ask any of the teachers, they all say that it is absolutely untrue. The students in the school are disciplined, willing to obey, orderly, polite, focused on their studies, and able to endure hardship, so there is no need for corporal punishment.</p>
<p>Among the students of the school, there is no shortage of excellent talents. For example, the male role Guan Zhengming, the female role Gu Zhengqiu, the painted-face role Zhang Zhengpeng, the copper hammer Xu Zhengjun, the young male role Xue Zhengkang (from Guangdong, whose parents are middle school teachers), the old female role Zhu Zhengqin, the martial female role Ma Zhengfeng, the ingenue role Zhang Zhengfang, the martial male role Wang Zhengkun, the comic role Sun Zhengyang, and the martial comic role Jing Zhengfei are all outstanding talents. The operas that have already been performed at the Golden Grand Theatre include *Fourth Son Visits His Mother*, *Zhong Kui Marries His Sister*, *Red Mane Stallion*, *Ti Ying Saves Her Father*, and *Lin Chong Flees at Night*. The school's directors are Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xiaochu, Wei Tingrong, and Bao Heqing. The principal, Chen Chengyin, graduated from Soochow University and practices law in Shanghai. The Director of General Affairs, Yu Yunggu, graduated from Aurora University and is a famous opera fan who is famous for specializing in the red-face role. The Director of Practical Affairs, Guan Hongbin, was a teacher at the Chinese Cultural Drama Troupe and went to the United States to perform. Ruidebao, Wang Yifang, Mu Shenglou, and Guan Shengming are respectively responsible for teaching, and are all famous Peking opera teachers.</p>
<p>However, since the establishment of the school, 130,000 yuan have been spent in 15 months, and it is currently in debt for 70,000 yuan, so the facilities are not as satisfactory as they could be. The only goal is to improve Peking opera and train new actors who meet the requirements. There is no shortage of people in the world who advocate art education, so how to cherish it goes without saying.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>

<h3>French Concession Issues Statement Temporarily Banning Football Matches</h3>
<p>Following the unfortunate events that occurred at the East China-West Precinct Grade A final at the Recreation Ground last Saturday, the French Concession authorities have decided to temporarily ban all football matches in the concession. The French Concession authorities issued the following statement yesterday:</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities have now decided to temporarily ban all football matches in the concession, as such matches have recently provoked unfortunate incidents that have disrupted public order. The police authorities have had to come forward to suppress them in order to maintain the safety of the concession and its residents. The necessary measures taken when the previous dispute occurred restored order and prevented a serious tragedy. However, such disputes easily lead to misunderstandings between residents and the police, which the authorities do not wish to hear of. Therefore, it is considered necessary to temporarily ban sports gatherings.</p>
<h3>West Union Did Not Issue Notice Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the unfortunate events that occurred at the Recreation Ground last Sunday, the West Union authorities did hold an emergency meeting after the incident, but the results were kept secret. The West Union Secretariat usually issues a notice every Monday morning, disclosing the weekend football schedule and announcing the progress or future administrative guidelines for the week, but there was no such notice yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Track and Field Season to Begin Soon, Hualian Prepares for Training</h3>

<h3>"Side Business"</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jun</p>
<p>On the anniversary of the death of the Premier, schools are closed as usual, which is an extra holiday for those of us who make a living by eating chalk dust. In theory, we should express our sorrow on this day; but who knows how many people are seeking pleasure in cinemas and entertainment venues!</p>
<p>I am a pauper. Because I am forced by life, I teach Chinese in two middle schools, which often causes my desk to be covered in piles of books and papers, and there is no time to clean it up. This should be a good opportunity. I finished grading one hundred and fifty books on Sunday, and then I had another holiday the next day. So I decided to clear them all out completely, so that I could have a breather during the week. So I ate some snacks early in the morning and immediately started working, and I actually finished grading the remaining one hundred books, and it was only two o'clock! This really made me overjoyed. I was secretly pleased that my blitzkrieg had completed the work that would have taken a week to complete.</p>
<p>At this time, I felt as if a burden of several hundred pounds had been lifted from my body. I felt infinitely happy. With light steps, I strode to the house of a small school principal in one breath. In addition to wanting to inquire about news from my hometown, I also wanted to discuss the future of China's recent political turmoil.</p>
<p>But everything was beyond my expectations. When I stepped into his office, the first question he asked me was what side business I had been doing recently? This question made me stunned. What side business could a teacher do? I was stunned for a while, and then I seemed to understand. I said very proudly, "I just write some manuscripts." "Oh, writing manuscripts is so hard, it's a brain-racking job, and a manuscript can't be exchanged for much money." I heard a knowing smile, because there were friends who could pity my life! But I finally sighed to him: "I can't do any other side business besides writing manuscripts." He heard my sigh and rocked his chair as if he had something else in mind, while taking out a cigarette and smoking. And me? Waiting for him to tell me about a labor-saving side business.</p>
<p>"Recently, prices have soared. You can make money by hoarding any goods. Look, I have hoarded 3,000 yuan of goods here, and now it's worth 1,500 yuan." He pointed to the goods piled up in the room while fiddling with the abacus. He really had a kind of dancing and foot-stomping demeanor, and his face was covered with the smiling face of a merchant.</p>
<p>He wouldn't have said anything if he hadn't said it. Once he said it, I couldn't help but make a note of the pilgrimage, and carefully looked at his small office. Cigarettes, soap, matches, kerosene, beer, and all other kinds of goods from north and south were available. It was simply like a warehouse. Only then did I understand; what he just said about a side business turned out to be hoarding for profit. I am now talking to a merchant. How can I interject on political and social issues? I had no choice but to dismiss my original intention of visiting and listen to the lecture on hoarding for profit.</p>
<p>I had a bitter smile on my face, perhaps a contemptuous sneer. I said to him: "Only someone like you, brother, has the capital to hoard goods! If I had so much spare money to hoard goods, to be honest, I wouldn't bury myself in the desk and rack my brains to write manuscripts. Now, I don't even have time to save the dying and keep myself alive. Hoarding goods to get rich is not only a stranger to me, but also something I don't want to do. Because I am now eating 125 yuan worth of rice!" I felt very happy to say it. I hurriedly left him.</p>
<p>Hoarding for profit can be regarded as a side business. I wonder if stealing, robbing, betraying the country for glory, and extorting can also be regarded as side businesses?</p>

<h3>Mother's Fate</h3>
<p>— Qiu Sheng</p>
<p>I respect my father very much, and I respect my mother even more. Sometimes I hate my father because I love my mother, because he created my mother's bad fate.</p>
<p>As early as the summer of sixteen years ago, I began to hear people say: My father loves to smoke opium. Although I was only twelve years old at the time, I already knew the harm of smoking opium: it not only damaged my father's health, but also could ruin my family's happiness and my future, so I was very sad.</p>
<p>My mother's face, which was usually full of laughter, disappeared because of my father's depravity. She sometimes sighed alone, sometimes cried to my father, and sometimes I shed a lot of hot tears along with my mother's crying.</p>
<p>In the spring of another year, my mother and I lived with my maternal grandmother. One warm afternoon, the sun shone all over the earth, butterflies flew and birds sang, and the universe was full of vitality. Although my mother was still young at that time, she seemed to have no vitality; for some reason, she talked about my father again, and my mother was crying in a corner again, and my maternal grandmother was also sighing beside her: "This is also your fate!... It also takes luck to marry a good husband!" This is like acting in a play, but the plot is too tragic, and I was moved to tears again. "Child! I only hope for you now!" My mother said intermittently. "But this hope is still far away, and I'm afraid your fate will not be able to escape following your father!" My mother's only hope was shaken again. "Mom!" I couldn't say anything, and my eyes suddenly became blurred.</p>
<p>It has been sixteen years since then, and my mother has suffered for sixteen years. According to my maternal grandmother, this is "mother's fate." My mother herself admitted that this is "fate," but she believes that this is the current "fate," and "fate" will change with time, and her future "fate" needs to be created by her later generations. So she believes that her future "fate" will shift with my "fate."</p>
<p>My mother attributed her whole life to "fate." She divided her "fate" into three periods and divided them into the bodies of people in three eras.</p>
<p>I don't know much about the first period of my mother's "fate," but according to my mother herself, because she is a girl, girls are always "people from other families," so she can't get the love of her parents; but under the protection of her parents, she lived a life that was better than a maid for eleven years. Although my mother was born into a wealthy family and her uncle was a university graduate, my mother only received two years of private school education.</p>
<p>According to my maternal grandmother, my mother's second period of "fate" was troubled for more than ten years because she "did not have the blessing to marry a good husband."</p>
<p>My mother's third period of "fate" has begun from now on, and she is now yearning for the arrival of good fortune.</p>
<p>Mom! You have suffered all your life! You believe in "fate" too much!</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Wen Ya</p>
<p>Life is a kind of consciousness, and consciousness is constantly changing, constantly advancing, just like time moving forward day and night. Since consciousness is constantly changing and constantly advancing, then our life is also constantly changing and constantly advancing: so life is evolving. And this evolution is gradually increasing and gradually creating along with the changing progress. Therefore, life is creative evolution—Bergson said.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(5) The Division Between Love and Desire</p>
<p>"If you hurt someone, I'm afraid it won't be so easy to let him out!" He held an empty teapot and walked out slowly, deliberately saying this in a voice that was not too loud or too low, wanting Qiu Haitang to hear it. He knew very well that this boss would never lose his temper with him. Qiu Haitang's temper towards his subordinates was certainly very good, but at this time, his lack of calculation with Rong Kui had another reason, and that was that he was too happy in his heart!</p>
<p>A woman who is so dignified and beautiful, and who has sufficient knowledge and noble character, has walked into his life's realm like a dream. The comfort that anyone could ask for has unexpectedly descended on the head of an actor. How could he not be happy about such an encounter? Now, even if Shen Ma Pi's men hold all his belongings together, or even lock him up in the police station like Zhao Yukun, he is satisfied in his heart, and he can also swear to them that he will never hate them, but will thank them; he will never forget that he was able to meet Luo Xiangqi in such a favorable situation, entirely because of their gift!</p>
<p>In fact, Luo Xiangqi not only did not reveal such a warm expression as Wang Treasurer's daughter-in-law did when they met, but also did not say a word to directly vent her feelings; if Qiu Haitang's feelings were not particularly sensitive, he would not know that she had developed feelings for herself beyond the ordinary. However, Qiu Haitang not only already knew, but also believed that as long as he moved forward in that direction, the kind of comfort he had been looking forward to for several years would surely be obtained.</p>
<p>Yuan Baofan's long and large figure and Zhao Yukun's late return also delayed his original plan for a few hours, but after the people in the hotel were completely asleep, he finally picked up his pen and lay on a small table, spreading out a very elaborate foreign paper letter that Zhao Si had bought for him, and decided to write the letter he wanted.</p>

<h3>A Record of Directing in a Dream</h3>
<p>— Qin Shiwu</p>
<p>I had a dream last night, and I was actually promoted to director. I can't not record it. It seems that I am already sitting on the set. The script is "A Dream of Fifty Years of Prosperity at Sea," which was given to me by the manager, saying that it was written by a senior writer. The set is an old-fashioned brothel, according to the script, it is Zhang Shuyu, one of the Four Heavenly Kings. That day, we were filming the Shanghai Daotai hosting a banquet in the courtyard. The Shanghai Daotai suddenly had a whim and wanted to borrow Zhang Shuyu's green sedan chair to take a ride around Fourth Horse Road, so there were a lot of jokes. I read the script carefully and admired the "insight" of this senior writer very much, because the themes of costume dramas have already been snatched up by others, and I have just been promoted to director, so if there is no good script, it will have a great impact on my reputation and future position in the film industry. Fortunately, I took the "inside line" and the manager gave me this good script; when it comes out in the future, haha, am I not a great director?</p>
<p>But the one who plays Zhang Shuyu is the company's "top star," and she seems to look down on me. The "romantic young man" who plays the Shanghai Daotai and the extras are all here, but her whereabouts are still unknown. Later, the stage manager secretly told me that as long as I do this and that, I will be successful. Sure enough, I made a phone call and did this and that, and in a few minutes, the sound of her car horn was already ringing outside the door.</p>
<p>The cameraman is an old friend. I secretly paid him a "bribe" in advance, such as close-ups, long shots, special effects, etc., so that he wouldn't have to hug Buddha's feet at the last minute and ask for trouble. After the top lights were turned on, it was actually brightly lit. While Zhang Shuyu was putting on makeup, I first filmed a joke about turtles and set builders—this was not in the script, because I wanted to please the company, so I came up with this wonderful interlude on the spur of the moment; and in order to take care of future public opinion, I also included the recent "turtle strike," isn't this the most realistic script that is most targeted at reality? A great director must move forward in order to get the best of both worlds!</p>
<p>But it's really terrible. After Zhang Shuyu finished putting on makeup, she began to regret her own feet. She shouted loudly: "How can I wear such small shoes?" Really, according to the script, not only Zhang Shuyu has small feet, but also the handmaidens, etc. have small feet. The gentleman who handled the props really worked hard and handled many three-inch red shoes, but those handmaidens all wore casual shoes, and some even didn't change their high heels. When I heard Zhang Shuyu's shout, I wasn't worried about anything else, but I was worried that the high heels had already been filmed in the scene I just filmed. I asked the cameraman, and he said: I saw it early, so all the shots were medium shots, no problem. This reminded me, why does Zhang Shuyu have to wear these red diamond shoes, everything is medium shots, isn't it OK?</p>
<p>"Shoot medium shots? Does the Shanghai Daotai want to lift my skirt to see my small feet?" After all, she is a big star, and she reads the script more carefully than I do. This is a close-up lens. If a pair of high heels are shown on the screen, wouldn't it be "funny"?</p>
<p>This is really a difficult problem. Why did I encounter this kind of difficult problem when I was promoted to director for the first time? So I had to discuss it with my old friend again. He said: I have never encountered such a difficult problem before, and the script has this paragraph, so if you don't delete it, you have to wrong Zhang Shuyu to "cut her feet to fit the shoes!"</p>
<p>When Zhang Shuyu heard this, she threw the high heels in her hand, and they hit me on the head. This blow pulled me back from my dream. I couldn't help but blush. "Cutting your feet to fit the shoes" is quite reasonable!</p>

<h3>Two Flowers of Blood</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Recalls Lord Pingyuan</p>
<p>Behind the wall is a spacious back garden. Under the moonlight, Zhang Cangqiu saw that the man jumped to the ground and was standing there looking back to see if anyone was chasing after him. Zhang Cangqiu made a whirlwind falling leaf on the wall and jumped down, protecting his head with a precious knife. Unexpectedly, as soon as his toes landed, the man had already struck with a hammer. Zhang Cangqiu blocked the precious knife and stabbed at the man's ribs with a knife. The man dodged sideways, danced with a single hammer, and fought fiercely with Zhang Cangqiu again. Just as they fought for eight or nine rounds, there was a sudden fierce barking sound in the garden. Five Tibetan mastiffs were seen behind the pavilion, their eyes glaring, their teeth bared, and their claws waving, rushing towards this side. Seeing the two people, they pounced up to bite them, regardless of who they were. The two had no choice but to abandon their opponents and resist the mastiffs on their own. Those giant mastiffs regarded the knives and hammers as if they were nothing, and were not afraid of anything, they just pounced fiercely. If you go to chop them or hit them, they will dodge, the formation is very solid, no less than five fierce tigers, the two were actually surrounded, and could not escape. At this time, there was a clamor of voices in the house, the lights were brightly lit, and seven or eight servants, carrying lanterns, ran out with a young man. The young man was wearing a Confucian scarf on his head, but he was wearing short clothes, holding a pear flower antique gun in his hand, and stepped forward and said, "Hey! Why are you fighting here? You must know that the giant mastiffs on my estate are not easy to mess with." Then he pointed the gun in his hand, shouted at the mastiffs, and ordered them to retreat. When the mastiffs saw their master arrive and heard the order, their ferocity suddenly subsided, and they wagged their tails and retreated to the back of the pavilion. The young man said to the man: "Warrior Chen, why are you fighting with this bearded man, where did he come from? It's strange to break into someone's house in the middle of the night!" The man didn't answer immediately after hearing this. Zhang Cangqiu laughed and said, "Go and ask him. How could I be willing to run here for no reason?" (14)</p>
<h3>A Life View of Struggle</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Some people see others failing because of struggle and think that fate is the supreme master. Rising and falling in prosperity and disgrace, nothing is not fate. If fate is not good, even if you struggle, it is in vain. It is better to live a sloppy life, and only ask the gods to pity me and give me a good fate in the next life. Ah, the word fate really harms many people, it is really the most powerful demon in the world!</p>
