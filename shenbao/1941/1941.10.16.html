<h3>中華民族百折不撓　美決不致犧牲中國　賴迪謨對美日會談表示意見　惟有奮戰始能解除一切桎梏</h3>
<p>重慶　蔣委員長政治顧問賴迪謨、乘公務稍暇、昨飛昆明、考察當地一般政情、約一週返渝、日後尚擬赴西北一行、賴氏行前、曾接見新華日報記者、泛談一切、謂辛亥革命、爲中華民族求獨立自由的革命、但荏苒三十年、仍受不平條約之束縛、可稱並未達其目的、惟此次對日奮戰開始以後、各國對華認識較前大不相同、中國國際地位、突然提高、英美亦從而允於戰事結束、和平實現後、廢除對華不平等條約束縛、此爲奮戰真收獲、亦可謂中國在奮戰中所得之進步、突過民國三十年來之進步、關於美日會談、賴氏不願多言、僅強調聲明、美國決不會犧牲中國、中華民族亦決不肯輕易被人犧牲、中華民族自身握有抵抗不屈之自由、而非他人所得加以操縱者云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>沙市附近華砲兵　向日陣地猛轟　市內日倉庫多處起火　岳陽江面擊沉三艦艇</h3>
<p>恩施　十三日下午、華某地砲兵、向沙市附近之日砲兵陣地射擊、摧燬日砲多門、旋猛射市內、日倉庫有多處中彈起火、十四晨、華某地砲兵向岳陽附近江面日艦艇猛烈射擊、結果擊沉日艦艇三艘、又華在當陽附近之部隊、與日　重部隊、遭遇於少麗廟附近、經華軍猛擊、斃日二百餘、並　獲軍品無算、（十四日電）</p>

<h3>民用飛機　改漆綠色</h3>

<h3>日軍退出長沙詳情　華側擊收效並斷日後方接濟　空軍竭力助戰乃得反敗爲勝</h3>
<p>桂林　各報記者此次作長沙之遊、曾獲在　所不能得之可貴消息、此次長沙雖嘗失守、但湘省華軍指揮、因自信力能克復、故未以城陷消息報告重慶、據華人各界意見、職是之故、重慶未能公布長沙戰情之詳確消息、致從於　軍勝利之特色不　盡悉、按　者桂南崑崙關失守時、當地指揮亦未報告、後華軍力戰　復該關、華人各界稱、此役爲華軍之後、日軍之退出南寗、</p>
<p>重要勝利　此爲其主因、惜外聞迄未知之、長沙外僑皆謂、此次日軍攻入長沙、志圖久守、不　得而復失、此役堪稱華軍之大勝利、據華軍中之蘇聯人聲稱、是役日軍死者約二萬人、而長沙英美教士與醫士、亦信日軍死者至少當在八九千人之間、彼等於日軍退出後、目擊長沙各街道日兵死屍頗多、華人各界皆謂長沙一役、足以證明華軍之戰門辦與士氣、蓋華軍指揮在戰爭初步中、曾經估日軍之實力、然華軍仍能堅持而將日軍逐走也、日軍之</p>
<p>渡新牆河、全出華軍之意料、當時華軍指揮以爲日軍之開集岳州區、徒爲調補而已、迨扼守新　河之華軍、報告日軍參戰者爲第三第四兩師團、上峯猶不之信、直至日軍渡　羅江、乃知日軍確以重兵進窺長沙、華方估計日軍作戰者、共有八萬人、並用華工約萬人、修築道路、但華軍不爲震恐、仍堅守長沙北面各陣地、直至援軍自南面開至、及由湘桂邊界西發、乃始反守爲攻、據調、此次日軍之敗北、多賴華　側擊、並在日軍後方斷其　擊接濟、及破壞公路、使日軍不能　用坦克車與砲隊之力、同時湘江西　獄麓山、　砲協助自西反攻之大軍、而空軍亦竭力助戰、於是　得</p>
<p>挽回戰局　、反敗爲勝、當日軍入城時、長沙耶魯醫院、挪威與蘇聯醫士、日軍入城者約五千人、因人數較少、不足完全佔據、故僅佔據北部與東北部、此所以新聞記者團遊於長沙時、曾見許多處絕無戰爭痕跡也、軍事觀察家皆謂、日軍之退出長沙、第五第六戰區之華軍同時取攻勢、亦與有力、蓋進攻長沙之日軍、其中顯多由該兩區調來之軍隊、軍事觀察家並信、一俟大砲飛機自美運到、華軍必將在各綫取總反攻、至少將在揚了流域一顯身手（十五日路透　）</p>
<p>長沙　此間外國人士、本日對於日　所稱、日是軍係自</p>
<p>退出長沙　極爲懷疑、據外國人士稱、城內日軍指揮官、在忽忙撤退之前數小時、尚元欲撤離之勢、日軍曾裝　話　、（在撤退時亦術仍拆去）並登記外人財產、在撤退前一日、日軍曾召集英美及挪威人士會議、要求彼等襄助組織難民委員會、伲勸逃離者歸來居住及營業、某外人稱、九月二十九及三十兩晚、巷戰甚爲劇烈、九月三十日白　、日軍尚全隊在此、但翌晨則不見一兵一卒、日軍之來也突然、其去亦突然、但日軍在撤退前一日、曾以旗幟授與意大利天主教會難民所之百　難民、令彼等在街頭整隊排列、然後由日軍導演、拍攝「中國平民歡迎日軍進長沙之真像」、據悉、華軍回長沙後、挪威僑民四人、並無被迫離去者、德國婦女三人、其中一人、係患病者、亦獲得暫留、其他之人、則未撤退、華當局已接收意大利天主教會產業、其中醫院一所、已撥歸中國紅十字會、關於德國產業之處分、尚未能探悉、（十五日合衆社長派員　斯　）</p>
<p>長沙　所有長沙外僑、本日皆對余云、九月二十七日進入長沙之日軍、其　動</p>
<p>極可惋惜　某教七　、日軍初入城時、似非常飢餓、　有可食之物及香烟、即行攫取、余曾見　手被　轉而倒斃之華軍、翌日日軍即　始搜查城內第一住宅、及每一商店、幾皆遭日軍侵入、城內難民所以外之華人、頗有遭害者、湘雅醫院之記錄、即可爲日軍行動之明證、在日軍進入長沙前、該院之記錄、僅有爲炸彈所傷割者、　日軍進城後、則有刺刀所刺傷者、大刀斫傷者、　首而未完成者、槍彈所傷者、　有其他慘狀者、該醫院之華籍職員、業已撤離、故該院僅有醫帥三人、及護士三人、約合平時人數五分之一、主持該院收容士千人難民所之青年美籍醫師柏特思、自日軍進入長沙後、平均每日施行大手術六宗、其　外科治療一百宗、至一百五十宗、襄助柏氏者有本夫人、及受有訓練之護士一人、曁外籍醫師兩人、余曾見中國平民一人、後頭頸刀創深入距脊髓之間幾不能容髪、僅前顧及兩側之肌肉尚　、醫師　渠可痊愈、長沙之外國人士、有曾計劃於九月二十七日晚離城　、但日軍在該日下午、</p>
<p>即已進城　　日軍曾在長沙之四日間、外國人士須守衛難民所、及其他外人產業、又須爲一萬七千餘名難民搜尋食品、及治療受傷者、有人云、在晚上略有卷戰、並有砲彈掠城而過、經過一晚後、彼等即在地穴中設置臥舖、居於地穴中、伹因神經緊張而不能入睡、余獲悉最困難之工作爲難民之結養、　難民、每日需米數噸、貧乏之難民所中、並無充分之存米、每日由教士及志願之　入、結隊持美國旗、至城內及近郊之店家所購、國際救濟委員會、亦在近郊積有有米、某教士稱、「有時亦頗困難、因日軍在搜集米糧、以供軍用、曾發生紛爭數次、幸無　重結果」云、該教士又　、日軍進城時、雞　及牲畜皆無人管束、四散奔逃、吾人即引之入難民所、以供肉食、吾人知其主　、亦將允許也、吾人並持旗幟至無人看管之菜園中採取蔬菜、以供給難民云、（十三日　社特派員斐　電）</p>

<h3>蘇聊境內嚴寒降雪　中路德軍攻勢加堅</h3>
<p>蘇軍增援全力保衛莫莫斯科　爭奪加里寗戰事空前劇烈</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十叫日瑞典京城電　據最後消息日來德軍對莫斯科之攻勢、業已大見遲緩、現正鞏固陣地、並調遣生力軍趕往前綫助戰、此在紅軍方面、亦復調動大批後備軍赴前綫增援、大半係自亞伯利亞開來之軍隊、此項士兵訓練有素軍紀嚴明、蘇聯方面渴望冬季早日降臨、所幸現已開始降雪、天氣驟冷、紅軍習以爲常、自不受天時之影響、但在德軍則顯難同日而語、即以南部烏克蘭邦而言、氣候亦已轉冷、致使德軍作戰、遭受重大打擊、至於莫斯科人心鎭定、均具決心、是以一切安謐如常、惟來自維亞慈瑪戰區之砲聲、隱的可聞、良以德軍自佔領維亞慈瑪城之後、即向莫茄斯克城（Mojarsk）猛進、與莫斯科相去僅五十哩也、此在奧萊爾戰區、雙方均作殊死戰、戰况激烈、前所僅見、丁莫生柯上將所指揮之紅軍部隊、奮勇保衛莫斯科、無不戮力抗戰、異常壯烈、至於列寗城戰區、紅軍在坦克車及飛機掩護之下、大舉反攻、以期分散德軍實力、惟因德軍砲火猛烈、紅軍尙未能突破德軍陣地、</p>
<p>合衆社十五日紐約電　昨日德蘇前綫之綜合報吿、謂決定莫斯科命運之殘酷鏖戰、在蘇京以外三百里之半圓形戰綫上展開、據稱、紅軍頃方阻抗德軍在東部雪地向前綫決職之企區、</p>
<p>合衆社十五日莫斯科電　進攻莫斯科之德軍、今日已向加里寗(Kalinin一名Tver)猛衝、加里寗在蘇京西北一百英里、居莫斯科列寗格勒間鐵路之中心、爲一重要交通中心、德軍循斯路錢、蓋欲於維亞茲瑪及奧萊爾兩據點外、更在加里寗成立里一第三據點、以便由此三路攻取蘇京、今日蘇軍戰事公報之提及加里寗尙係首决、其詞意表明德軍在對蘇京防軍施用壓力前、尙欲採用一種計劃以縮短中央陣綫、加里寗位於伏爾加河左岸、並在莫斯科列寗格勒間鐵路沿綫、目爲進取蘇京最近之路、（按維亞慈瑪在莫斯科以西一百三十英里、奧萊爾在莫勘科南二百十英里、目下向加里寗壓迫之德軍則已在莫斯科西北的一百英里、）加里寗城建於十二世紀末葉、有人口十萬人、爲伏爾加河上游之最大工業中心、該城之重要、係因旣近波羅的海、復沿流貫斯達林莫斯科等地之伏爾加河所致、德軍之進薄加里寗、乃使莫斯科所受包圍之威脅、更較以往爲迫近、而令防守蘇京者將認保衛蘇京東由出路之後方爲第一要務矣、目下維亞茲瑪及白林斯克兩處戰爭旣甚劇烈、而德軍同時又直衝加里寗、足微德軍之進攻蘇京益呈緊張、</p>
<p>蘇發動猛烈反攻　飛機一萬架助戰</p>
<p>路透社十五日倫敦電　北起加里寗南至奧萊、聞見現有保衛莫斯科之生力軍三個軍團加入作戰、或正在途中、此項軍隊刻在力抗德方鐵甲車攻勢、並有飛機萬架輔助作戰、實力頗爲强勁、莫斯科以西之莫茄斯克附近續有大戰、昨日被逐出之德軍先頭部隊、似已重佔該城、</p>
<p>路透社十五日倫敦電　據此間所接消息、維亞慈瑪區域之德軍在蘇聯最堅强抵抗之下、雖損失慘重、但頗有進展、德方宣稱該區蘇軍已完全殲滅、而蘇方則謂現正發動猛烈之反攻、丁莫生柯上將刻正趕調軍隊對付德軍由加里寗向莫期科之新攻勢、此項攻勢威日莫斯科與列寗格勒之交通德人或圖由北路包抄莫斯科、爭奪莫斯科鐵路之戰事規模浩大、雙方均調生力軍參加作戰、</p>
<p>中區殲滅戰結果　德軍陣亡十五萬</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十四日瑞典京城電據蘇聊方面消息、白林斯克及維亞慈瑪兩戰區殲滅戰結果、德軍陣亡者十五萬員者，受傷者四十五萬員名、尙有大批官兵被俘、衆料中路紅軍司令丁莫生柯上將麾下之紅軍當將誓死抵抗、以保衛莫斯科、目下氣候業已轉寒、此與守軍大爲有利、</p>
<p>路透社十五日倫敦電　德軍司令部從希特勒行營發表特別文吿、謂被圍於維亞慈瑪區之蘇軍、已悉數殲滅、而被圍於白林斯克區之蘇軍亦近崩潰、德軍在此兩役中、俘敵逾五十萬、其數日在增加中、蘇俘總數遂達三百萬以上云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十四日柏林電　德意志通訊社頃發表消息稱、蘇軍自維亞茲瑪退却時、會縱火焚燒、街市一片荒凉、僅見殘垣斷壁、蘇軍所埋地雷已由德國工兵移去、</p>
<p>蘇承認南路紅軍　撤離瑪里奧波爾</p>
<p>塔斯社十五日莫斯科電　蘇聯情報局發表公報稱、「十月十四日吾軍沿全綫與敵軍作戰、在維亞慈瑪，白林斯克及加里寗方面戰况允烈、經過數日之激戰後、吾軍撤離瑪里奧波爾（Marinpol）（南路阿索夫海區）、十二日德機八十丸架被毀、其中二十七架係在空戰中被擊落、另六十二架則在機場上被毀、吾方亦損失二十三架、</p>
<p>合衆社十五日莫斯科電　蘇聯之宣布放棄瑪里奧波爾、已使德軍進展至距維斯托夫（Rostov）一百英里以內之地、羅斯托夫者、為德軍攻擊阿索夫海地帶之主要目的、一重要之工業及冶金中心也、聞瑪里奧波爾之淪陷、乃予德人以側攻唐納資工業區域之據點、而使蘇聯最重要很據地之一之羅斯托夫愈感威脅矣、</p>

<h3>東報評論　德蘇戰局　蘇力量未可輕視</h3>
<p>路透社十五日東京電　被稱爲外務省喉舌之「日本廣知時報」評述德軍對莫斯科之攻勢云、蘇軍雖傳損失重大、但仍甚可畏、此時應勿作未成熟之斷語、以爲蘇德戰事已近結束、須知强大之後備及廣博之土地、仍可爲繼續抗戰之泉源也、倘使蘇聯純採守勢、德人自不難進取、唯取攻勢始能有任何眞正力量、今後數週將可表現莫斯科之是吾有此反攻能力云、</p>

<p>台衆社十五日東京電　素常反映近衛首相及平沼男爵意見之「中外商業新聞」、今日撰一社評、對美國方面弛言美日、衝突可能之事、表示遺憾、該評稱、「吾輩日人咸從未夢想及美。日之衝突、日·美兩國、無衝突之理由」、又言、「坦白言、吾人對局勢不感滿意、甚願有所要求、惟吾人認爲其間並無不可解決之問題、實無衝突之必要、」該報最後又稱、美·日若果衝突、其責任全在美國、故「吾等已吿美國、對局勢應作考慮、但若戰事延至遠東、日本將受其害、因美國對之並不嚴重關懷也一、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>蘇德戰局與日本</h3>
<p>莫斯科外圍大戰，現方達到如火如荼程度，而蘇聯首都的最後命運乃爲舉世所一致繫念。不過，仔細探究當前局勢，蘇德戰况固然可慮，其危險性的程度或尙不如遠東之甚。第一，蘇德之間，雙方都具有不勝則亡的意念，而允以蘇聯方面此種感覺更較深切，因此不只絕少妥協可能，蘇方也勢不能不把最後一分力量都用於此一搏鬥，斷不會輕易讓辛苦經營的體系制度遭受根本被剷除的噩運。第二，英美對蘇的援助，正以極大決心向着龐大目標進行，而且戰具而外，更已考慮到派兵助戰問題；假如蘇聯不幸眞而陷於不能支持，則美國的對德作戰必不免立即實現，正有如前决大戰中之在蘇聯與德停戰而後實行參戰一樣。更何况納粹攻蘇前途荆棘正多，本報昨日社論已詳爲論列，這一局勢，始終並無可以悲觀的理由。而在遠東方面，則假使局勢惡化，美蘇都有陷入兩面作戰的可能，其對於蘇聯的危險性也許比較莫斯科的兵臨城下更大。連日美國輿論，正對此作最大的關切，雖然日公使若杉返美後，雙方又有繼續接觸，顯然並不能減輕一般人士的這種杞憂。</p>
<p>日本崇拜納粹的熱情，近半年來業已遠遜疇昔，蘇德戰事的發生允使日當局感到徬徨，其間雖內閣一度改組，且傳業已製就多面性的應付方案，似亦未减輕其舉棋不定之窘狀，而允其最近日方輿論，對於納粹的勝利並不甚感興趣，無甯到隱隱存有希望蘇聯能夠遏阻納粹攻勢的意向。此種心理其實並不足怪，固然蘇聯敗退是日本北進的機會，而另一方面：假如蘇聯眞從此一蹶不振，則納粹勢力必將長趨東下，無論其南出印度洋或東出太平洋，都將是日本「東亞共榮圈」的重大威脅；如果蘇聯在歐境敗退之後繼續堅決抗戰。則將以其亞洲領士爲主要根據地，除却經過彼斯灣出海一路而外，鄰近日本的海參崴港將成爲蘇聯最重要的對外通路，這又是日方所最感不快的事。是以爲日本設身處地想，其所最感有利的局勢是蘇聯的敗而不退，而實力則迅速消耗。以至不得不調動遠東駐軍西開，則彼時日本如實行北進則輕而易舉，南進亦無後顧之憂，，而駐在東北的幾十萬大軍更不妨調釗任何一個需要增援的所在。比較起等待納粹獲得絕對勝利後再從中以盟友資格分一杯羹，自然是此勝於彼。</p>
<p>不過假使蘇聯首都不守，則無論此後蘇德戰事歸趨如何，日本必不免對東部西比利亞有所動作、以遂其擴展或「自衛」的意願，即使此舉在本質上不能和兩年前蘇聯的進軍波蘭一舉相提並論，在形態上却正相彷彿，而且有司樣必然性的。近兩月來，日當局對於如何鬆弛（其實只是延宕）美日關係始終不肯釋念，代表近衛平沼見解的中外商業新聞且於社評中表示：「吾輩日人咸從未夢想及美日之衝突，日美兩國·無衝突之理由」；而對於此後蘇日關係的如何發展，則三數月來日政府始終保持着神秘的緘默，一任若干極端論調叫囂不休，此中消息，是値得深思的。</p>
<p>最近的美日關係，美國是在完成了必要準備之後讓日本自己去選擇何去何從，不過在美方所已進行的準備之中却存有若干漏洞，有如北太平洋的無保障狀態就是一例，因此從另一角度看來，也就是日本仍舊處在主動地位，遠東危機之是否爆發，其權力實操在日人手裏。目前ABCD陣綫與蘇聯在遠東的實力自然不容輕估，但却必須確實掌握主動地位，纔能充分控制這一危局的發展，即使蘇德戰事未必沒有新的良好轉機，對於遠東也絕不容不針對着最惡劣的局勢去謀所以應付之道。</p>

<h3>莫斯科空襲紀實</h3>
<p>莫斯科地下鐵道車站</p>
<p>這篇是美國Collier's週報莫斯科特派員墨紫女士在空襲中的無綫電報吿，茲譯錄於决：</p>
<p>莫斯科已經突然感受到戰爭的影響了。經過四星期的沉寂，住在莫斯科的人，不易相信歷史上最大的戰役，即在數白英里之外，如野火燎原般進行着。旣而轟炸開始了。高射砲的炸裂聲，機關槍的怒吼聲，燒夷彈着火所引起的牆壁倒坍聲，一時籠罩了莫斯科。一般人却屹然不動，皆認爲轟炸方興未艾，此後許多星期中，或將夜夜受到轟炸呢。</p>
<p>最初的四夜（七月二十三日至二十六日），德機總在每晚十時與十時十五分之問光臨，時刻不爽，第五夜我們却直等到半夜。日間倒很太平，近暮時雖常有偵察機飛過，但防空當局却決定不鳴警報，以免多所驚擾。白晝的工作時間，絲毫不受阻礙，晚上的娛樂也繼續不輟。人民在街道上閒步，酒樓菜館和戲院劇塲之中，依然人滿爲患。他們晚餐頗早，將近十時，立即回家。他們收拾舖蓋，準備警報一鳴，便帶到最近的防空室或地道中去。據新頒章程，在敵機未到以前，亦許婦孺在地道中過夜。這種地下車站，用烏拉兩山的大理石砌成，久爲莫斯科人所引以自豪，現在却大得其用，竟非始料所及。俄國人一等播音器放送出那個不祥之字Trevoga（俄文警報），接着聽得氣笛齊鳴，便小稍猶豫的我尋藏身之地。一决我立在陽台上，望見民衆從各街道湧進方塲，又從方塲湧進地道。不到十分鐘，街道上已闃無人跡。這種忽忙急迫，乃因當局現則甚嚴，在警報未　時，即須尋得隱蔽的緣故，而非全由於恐怖所致。</p>
<p>我每夜更換宿所，改變環境，以便對於當時情形得一淸楚詳盡的觀念。第一夜我在地道裏，第二夜在一個英國新聞肥者的公寓內，從窗間外望，可以俯視南北兩面，第三夜仕市中心的一家旅館裹，窗戶西向，第四夜則在美國大使住宅裏。我現在執筆寫稿的地方，是在俄京二十哩外，兩個大使合居的住宅裏。此屋用白漆的木料築成，位於鄉下，四周樹木環繞，風景優美。花園中種着蜀菊，百日草，和金魚草等名花。我早晨到此，還疑是世外桃源，不料半夜裏却聽到了警報。</p>
<p>我關在一問密閉的小室裏，使燈光不致外射。正當伏案寫稿之時，忽聽得高射砲聲，震耳欲聾。我便衝出屋外，到陽台上和衆人在齊翹首仰視，看那探照燈光在雲中突出穿進，搜尋敵機，有時騐照到屋上面。忽然聽見轟炸機引擎軋軋之聲，一會兒却父消逝，無疑的那些飛機已逃回根據地去了</p>
<p>首决空毀的那一夜，我在旅館中方欲解衣就寢，聽得警報之聲，急忙披上襯杉，向下面方塲的地下軍站一直跑去。早晨雖會鳴過一次警報，但歷　時甚短，亦無事故發生，現在地道中人，比早晨要擁擠得多，可是絕無推擅之事，每個人却安靜地走進入口，下落台階。在這種情形之下，自然用不着買票，他們在月台上徘徊往來，隨意談話，消磨時光。</p>
<p>我看見攝影家焦格利靠着石柱，坐在他寳貴的攝影機箱上，就上前招呼。不一會，每個人都奉命令下入隧道。我們儘量把脚步放慢，希望走在最後，那樣靠近隧道的入口，空氣可望較好，可是警察執令甚嚴，我們祇得擠在一羣人中間，學他們的樣子，把報紙舖在軌道上，席地而坐。</p>
<p>我們說的外國話，已被人聽見，我們就成爲嫌疑人，被帶到一所小棚內查問，棚裏坐着一個民團隊長，旁邊一架電話機，整夜鈴聲不絕。他要我們拿出護照，查看無誤，便放我們走了。</p>
<p>我雖被查訊，卻並不感到煩惱，因爲與當地警察的交涉，這回已是第四决了。那三次都是我和住在美國大使住宅附近的朋友們在一起時發生的。</p>

<h3>金融　金市由跌　騰踊而上</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、竟背外滙之回鬆、由跌反步趨騰漲、現金允反覆靡定、一萬一千元大關破入後重見回出、各方人心惴惴不定、初因外滙報鬆、市氣較虛、曾退見一萬零七百元低價、不久兩華行暗中仍進、港幫不斷收吸、上日傾售千餘兩之津幫忽來復進、遂起昂勢、午刻回出一萬一千元關、下午滬西幫亦來拖進、升見一萬一千三百六十元高價、後聞現紗轉跌、在散漫之賣勢下、終退至一萬一千二百元、尙軋升二百元、全日交易九百數十兩、十月期金證券號錢兌業先後買進、滙票商求多供少、價由晨開八千二百元步飛上至八千五百四十元、軋升二百七十元、成交二千兩光景、飾金初跌至一千一百元、後亦步升達一千一百五十元、最後一千一百四十元、軋升十元、</p>
<p>萬一千元進而復出</p>
<p>烚赤現金跌後復漲、一萬一千元大關進入後、復衝出、晨承上日疲勢、即見低落、萬豐售予聚豐永十兩為一萬零七百五十元、低二百五十元、俄見萬豐出永豐餘十兩、遜至一萬零七百元、天元合盛德大來力進、抬至一萬零九百元、升起二百元、俄見天元復出、永成義元合成大豐爭出、瀉去七十元、天元出祥與永一百兩、為一萬零八百三十元、祥與永新豐永賣進、及見德孚復購、時和祥和亦進、午刻上升更銳、回出一萬一千元外、步升三百元、祥與永出祥和二十兩、德孚十兩、升至一萬一千一百三十元、經祥與永再出、午收壓下至一萬一千一百元、下午德孚又來補空、立見抬起一百八十元、始進公和三十兩、為一萬一千二百八十元、恒記售一萬一千二百七十元、德大明豐德孚天元同康永及某銀樓買進、當又哄上九十元、立泰進德成二十兩、及天元永成各十兩、知到一萬一千三百六十元、為永成誠達公和祥與永祥和先後爭出、重見步降一百六十元、終見德成出某金號十兩、晚收一萬一千二百元、比十日復漲二百元、當日有六百六十元高低、收後一萬一千一百八赴元有賣戶、全日交易共九百數十兩、金號本版金、門市售價一萬一千三百元、收進比售出低三百元、</p>
<p>期貨人心民時向榮</p>
<p>自晨十月期每條（十兩）九點半開市、即低五十元、為八千二百元、大豐力進、頓見提升至八千二百八十元、忽見誠達恒記新豐永來吐售、當見盤小六十元、為八千二百二十元、午刻因現金復步漲、價亦在順源合盛祥興永熾大德大之買風中、步七十元為午收價、下午開市即低二十元、為八千四百五十元、順源大豐力進、當見抬至八千五百四十元、恒記誠遽售至八千叫百七十元、終以人心向上、大豐天元買進、四點收市八千千五百二十元、復漲二百七十元、常日有三百四十元上落、</p>
<p>銀樓鉓金先退後進</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行晨九點三刻掛小三十元、為一千一百元、不久步升三次、午刻掛一千一百四十元、下午掛牌升至一千一百五十元、四點為一千一百四十元、軋升十元、收進减五十元云、</p>
<h3>說有美票吐出　黑匯改觀</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌各滙皆平、滙豐等小櫃檯價呆定如前、英美繼黑黑市反動驟起回鬆、乃出口商售予某銀號美匯三元三七五後、忽聞滙豐銀行有美票吐出、價已回低至三十元關邊、進口商均趨觀望中止活動、而出口商與華商私人有五千美元限三元半求售、無買戶、勢趨步賤、正午收市三元六二五亦不一定可售、英匯二辦士一八七五、比上日晚收、美長二五、英長一二五、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>香港十五日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤呆滯異常、各滙仍無榮辱、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津十五日（週三）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、倫敦電滙仍無變動、紐的電滙緊一二五、為四元八七五、申滙降五角、為九十五元、「聯鈔」暗盤賤一元二角五分、為四十三元五角、</p>
<h3>美鈔橫跌　大利所在供給旺</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊頗為穩定、英金票需要殷切、市價激漲六元、美金票因經某銀行帳房間售出後、市上紛傳該行有巨額美鈔供給、以致人心驟虛、晚市已退至三十元零七角、比上日軋跌五角、香港票供求尙勻、市價站平、日金票仍站二元六角原盤、朝鮮票略趨漲勢、晚市升為二元一角一分、</p>
<p>又訊、美金票從三十五元許的最高峰、逐步回小到三十一元外、昨午後、叉跌到三十元零幾角、回跌原因、據說沓港方面、每一元美金票、僅合法幣二十四兀許、有人見有利可圖、即私自携帶五十元及百元之美票、（少數）至滬脫售、每百元美票、可獲利法幣六七百元之鉅、每一旅客帶幾張百元之美票、眞是輕而易舉、只要有錢賺、有財發、管他危險不危險呢、美票之跌、與此亦不為無因、</p>
<h3>證券　華商股票</h3>
<p>蓬勃氣象一斑　內債重遭挫折</p>
<p>公僓暗盤、昨市初堅後疲人心仍屬恍惚、川幫雖已止賣、而華僑忽有現貨賣出、債市甫有回蘇之象、遽叉遭打擊、丙種復又敵破七十元關、加以日美談判又告決裂、人心亦不無虛弱、形勢因每决上漲、必有現貨流出、故前途尙不易看好、昨上午新華信字聯和天生等買進、丙種開價好四五角、無奈恒康怡泰同順久豐賣出為湧、午收回至四角收盤、午後信孚繼續買進、聯益同順生興牛大等買進、丙種以零六角開盤、比午收又好二角、奈久豐潤德怡泰協興元仁昌同康等或代華僑或代金融界等紛紛賣出、由零六角賣起直綫下降、遽跌一元之多、甫有萌芽、又遭蹴損，七十元大關重復打破、結果除乙種尙微好五分外、其他各種反小二三角、成交總數共計約一百八九十萬元、華列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股二百股、每股價為十九元正、按近來各種華商股票、需要者極多、即永昌一家、巳經登記買進者、不下數十種、如金融股浙江興業二百元、金城一百九十元、鹽業二百元、中國墾業一百零五元、國華九十七元五角、國貨八十元、紡織股如慶豐二百三十元、廣勤一百七十五元半、永安二百三十元、新藥股如五洲二百十五元、中西、百元、新亞五十一元、ＡＢＣ內衣老股十八元、新股十六兀、其他如商務書館二百十元、中華書局一百十五元、龍章造紙一百十元、華商水泥一百元、天廚味精二百六十元、天利淡氣九十五元、梅林罐頭二百兀、大中華橡膠二百元、中興煤礦二百元、冠生園九十五元、此尙係犖犖大者、需要極夥、尙無人供給、其餘小股、需要允多、此僅指永昌一家代理、其他各家可以推知、股票業已蓬勃氣象、完全為物價有漲無跌使然耳、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市、交易活潑、趨勢由穩而堅、多種父告回漲、墾植股成交最鉅、高價見五十六元、收價五十五元半、亞洲股最高亦達二十四元二五、但瞬即回落元許，橡皮股趨勢較軟、收盤時略又回高、</p>
<p>倫敦十四日（週二）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、均告平滯、祇麥加利銀行股回升一先令三便士、價為九鎊半、餘無變動、</p>
<h3>油市　油儈操縱不懈　食油一跌即漲</h3>
<p>昨日食油一跌即漲、初因實銷淸閒、人心頗為軟弱、價見下挫四五元、嗣以多方逢低復起吸收而告回振、結果與前相彷、計售開靑島生油四十桶、叉又豆油五十桶、大有廠淸油一三百擔、又菜油二百擔、泰山廠菜油四百擔、立德廠菜油五百擔、大生廠菜油二擔、日華廠菜油一百桶、</p>
<h3>糧食　大戶不肯多售　米價雖跌不鉅</h3>
<p>昨洋米漲風已挫、各擋市價均見回平、惟大戶尙不肯儘量售出、而新多散囤還想趁小問津、故市價終米克過份抑低耳、早晨開市時因傳有二千噸洋米結滙訂妥、人心巳平、而工部局亦有二千五百噸小絞電洽三十九元七角六分之說、加之本街門市尙有公倉小絞與公賣小絞之供給、實銷銳减、客囤亦呆、投機者小免膽怯、市乃一度在賣風中銳落三五元、繼有補空與囤收市父回站、小絞外棧曾低至一百卅元、午收銀行棧為一百三十二元、下午仍在一百三十二元間、比前日終小二三元、英華司即裝小絞一百六十一元、現貨一百五十四元半至一百五十三元半、亦小元外、迨收盤一號西貢高貨復至百叫十八元、普通百四十六元、中關百四十三四元、二號百三十二四元、一號暹邏百四十二元、二號白三十一元、决至百二十九元半、敏黨高貨百四十元、百三十八元、中關百三十五元至百三十三元、渣華尖特別百四十三元、普通百四十元、碎尖高自百零八元半、决至百零五元半、成交五百噸、又近萬包、</p>
<p>太古公司漢陽輪、昨晨抵滬、由杳港運來人批洋米、共計一萬三千八百七十七包、其中一萬一千叫百包、係工部局之平價洋米、該輪停靠法租界外灘該行碼頭、昨午已開始起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄新破兩粳國米市、昨則呈定降不一之局面、乃以西新上市出新日旺、故新貨到頭頗湧、不下二三百石、而本鄉店銷應用尙狹、因之供過於求、市面遂難立足、見貶二元左右、計聞崑山新粳百五十三四元、靑角窰種百五十三四元、至於南港早破適屬相反、旣屆落令之期、內地存底將罄、所以到貨時有不繼之虞、而店舖門市應需頗廣、常感不敷分配、以是情形與新貨不同、故得獨見站定、未有榮辱、繼開百五十七元至百五十四元、新社尖突以乏貨無市、</p>
<p>糯米市貨雖亦寥落、但以市價一再上升、業已轟足、故洋米回疲、零星納胃頓滯、行情並跌一二元、開計港白元高自百五十元、决至百五十七元、糯茶祇有特別開出百四十四元、</p>
<h3>客囤乘平復收　洋粉午後重騰</h3>
<p>昨洋粉上午市頗平正、各粉價均見三兩角之盤旋、及至午後、又有客囤大戶之趁平吸收、市面又復節節盤漲、而金龍粉買氣最濃、漲度亦勁、西棧金龍早市祇三十八元八角至三十九元、下午乃漲達三十九元六角、又東棧上午祇三十九兀至三十九元一二角、下午則又昂達四十元、均比前日又漲起近元、砲台上午四十元零五分至四十元零五角、下午至四十元零七角半、亦較大半元、雙鷹三十九元一角、紅日當天三十九元半、鐘樓三十九元零五分、財神過磅三十九元二角、五燕又至三十九元七角、成交內外併計不下五萬多包、</p>
<h3>麩皮與小麥　供給仍感缺乏</h3>
<p>麩皮連日騰漲不巳、昨客囤繼續放價吸收、小包父昂一元、為四十一元、貨主以籌碼枯乏、曾喊全四十二元、</p>
<p>小麥連日存到兩少、執貨者者一再居奇扳俏、日華各大廠均不易收買、昨有小廠曾放開六十五元之新高價、乃辦去一千三四百包、高杜麥云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布投機作崇　實銷絕少價復上升</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨平、午後突漲、乃受投機市塲影響、實鉗絕鮮動態、而執貨者氣勢驟盛、一致板價、囤戶再來吸收、故結果粗布斜紋漲五角半辛五角、細布漲五角至一元、漂染布開價參差、亦漲五角之譜、客銷僅北路烟津幫辦去一百餘件、浙東定海幫辦粗布等七八十件、仍以本街獨盛、綜計成交八百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　取引所期貨先跌後回、結果本月份龍頭軋升七角、收盤價六十五元一角、十一月份漲五角、十二月份漲三角、一月份僅漲五分、故以期貨觀測、雖漲仍軟、而現貨市塲則殊堅穩、細布細斜統扯每疋漲一元左右、龍頭細布新廠單晚收為六十八元三角、四君子嗶嘰新單二元四角六分　五、</p>
<h3>糖市　現糖略鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市期貨仍在伶頓中、現貨則見鬆動、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白九月份入口初劃二百零二元、旋降至一百九十九元至九十三元半、下午復昂至二百零四元至二元·小一元、八月份二百元至一百九十一元、下午一百九十八元至二百元、降度相同、七月份一百九十七元·九十五元·九十一元、下午九十七元至一一百元、六月份一百九十元、五月份一百八十七元牛、香港貨一百九十一元步小至八十五元及八十元、下午八十四元至八十六元半、小二元、太古車白ＨＸ嘜一百八十二元、下午八十九元、小一元、統共成交三萬二千餘包、</p>

<h3>當局對操縱物價　應迅施干涉職權</h3>
<p>盼工部局採取嚴峻措置　進口商及市民均願協助</p>
<p>外僑與論切實擁護現行管理外滙辦法</p>
<p>外匯再黑市、自十三日猛縮，創空前緊張混亂局嚴後、貪得無厭之投機商人、竟將日用必需品價格、又予抬高、影響人民生活、至大目鉅、故中外各方、均甚憂懼、迨至昨日、法幣價俗、乃見回漲、黑匯略鬆、美金票出三十五元跌至三十元、但食品價格、於十四日漲起一成後、咋日仍形堅挺、此種嚴申情形、關係方面及本市當局、若不迅速設法補救、則前途誠不堪設想、在本埠出版之英文金融商業週報、於討論經濟問題頗握權威、昨日曾發表兩文、一爲擁護現行管理外滙辦法」、一爲、物價高漲之眞正原因及補救辦法之建議」、均係討論上述嚴重問題之名者、一說明中國當局決不致放棄上海、</p>
<p>法幣數量　並未增加</p>
<p>管理外匯之目的、即　維持民衆生活及工業發　、但不願浪費於非必需品、平準會規定優越匯率、月的即仆雜持七月二十六日前物價之水準、但奸商利用各種藉口、高抬物價、此非平準會之咎、甚望當局、能際此非常時期、採嚴峻辦法對付之、以解除民衆疾苦、在另文中、說明法幣流通數量、　未增加、通貨膨脹之說、足證紀到不確、今商人利用非必需品减少供給外匯之藉口、高抬物價、實應速予制裁、一、盼市民立即停止購儲貨物、二、工部局應會同進口商人、將各種進口物品價格、與願照合法純利定價出售之商店名稱公布、以制止居奇牟利、深信必有良好反響云云、茲摘錄兩文大意於後、</p>
<p>上海市場　必予維持</p>
<p>「擁護現行管理外匯辦法」一文大意略謂、一中國當局決不致放棄上海市塲、證之過去事實、中國政府不願將上海委棄於日方、可知必繼續予以支持、但有限制而已、同時對於足以影響滬市民衆生活及工業發展之一切事態、亦異常關切、上海多數貿易、對自由中國內地及沿海之戰時經濟有甚助益、多數輸入上海進口物品、最後目的地、仍爲自由中國、同時本埠工廠、大多接受自由中國主顧之定貨、中國政府極力維持上海市塲、但不願以分文浪費於非必需品、自由中國法幣價値、無需任何支持、因法幣對國外貿易之任意價値、已得友邦（即英美及蘇聯）之承認、自由中國法幣、爲淸算國際賬目之工具、並爲實行物物交換之標準、供給滬必需品外匯須維持至若何程度、方不致損害上海之主要利益、惟有經騐、始足以證明之、我人必須能待試騐時期之經過、</p>
<p>出口匯票　均應提供</p>
<p>値得硏究之主要問題，爲如何自出口商虛獲得英美出口匯票、今與民主國家銀和之合作、業已取得、凡民主國家出口商、均將其外匯售結其本國銀行、使平準會基金能應付裕如、但多數出口商、僅總供一小部份之出口匯票、間有完全不提供者、在另一方面、有一部份出口商行、以其所得外匯、劃撥巨數、以供維持國外之分行之用、同時、保險費及出口商之投資、亦須由出口匯票中扣除、估計上海目前進口業所需要之外匯、下述數字、甚可重視、上海與英鎊美金荷盾集團交易、本年度每月平均虧損爲美金四千四百萬元、此種虧損、但爲理論上的、本年實際所受虧損、尙不止此數、本年度最初八個月、上海對英美菲荷印之進口、總値爲美金八千八百六十萬元、出口總値爲五千三百五十萬元、一九四〇年數宇、進口總値爲美金一億萬元、出口總値爲三千七百七十萬元、如以一九四一年滬市入超、與一九四〇年相較、即本年爲美金三千五百二十萬元、去年爲六千二百三十萬元、則上海與英鎊美金集團貿易差額之進步、似最堪令人注意、</p>
<p>物價標準　早有規定</p>
<p>準會爲制上海物價上高漲、得中政府之同意、規定法幣之優越匯率、此决對特許進口物品之平準匯率、目的在維持由民主國家輸入物品價格、使保持於七月二十六日美國宣佈凍結中日資金以前之水準、事實上所有核准進口物品、除由於水脚保險費而有微　外、各外籍進口商行、均以舊價出售、此輩進口商、對於被禁止進口物品、大多用或種方法、獲取滙票、而以高價出售、各商店及零售商、雖繼續有進口商以七月間價格供給商品、但此輩零售商、無不大抬其價格、若輩並不說明繼續漲價之理由、此係赤裸裸之壟斷牟利、公然剝削、一般囤戶堅不脫手、亦爲造成混亂局面原因之一、進口商勢不能越出本人地位、干涉其營業、七海僅有之當局（工部局）、依然拒不承認、其對于此一問題之責任、在此種非常時期、必須以非常手段對之、工部局於去年春間、曾得納稅人大會授以更大權力、且巳不復受納稅人之限制、應當迅有新的措置、以適應新的需要、苟本埠當局、不採取任何行動、則本年冬季、數百萬華人、及數千外人、將遭遇重大不幸無疑、過去數日中發展情形、酷似一九一八年世界和平以後數年中歐洲各國人民所遭遇通貨膨脹之大悲劇叙幕、本埠投資商人、極力砍將法幣脫手、多數人將存款提出、在不知不覺間、變成囤戶、遂致造成物價騰貴之情形、設此種不合理之恐怖狀態繼續存在、則滬市之經濟生活、將被摧毀矣、</p>
<p>通貨臌脹　絕對不確</p>
<p>「物價高漲眞正原因及補救辦法之建議」、一文、大意謂、由於過去一週間之發展、以爲上海已進入通貨膨脹之時期、此說不足置信、關鍵所在、爲對貨幣信仰不堅、但目光遠大者、均認爲完全不合理、法幣雖暫時不能以之自由購買外滙、但日軍票何獨不然、然囤戶與投機商人、對日軍票之效用戶、已司空見慣、故得維持有利價値、法幣私運至上海、爲不受歡迎及不幸之事態、今郵局已禁止滙寄、私運之事、亦已漸减少、故可斷言、在過去二月中、法幣之流通數量、並未有巨大之增加、同時以法幣兌換他種貨幣、已遭禁止、但在凍結令頒佈前若干月、華人國外資金巳寄回本國、且華人對外匯之需耍、祇爲供貿易上之用途、就上述種種情形言、均不足以說明爲通貨膨脹、</p>
<p>囤貨情形　怪誕已極</p>
<p>自所申請外匯能有正常供給後、外匯情形、河漸澄淸、但同時上海亦自應設法制止物價之繼續上漲、實爲當務之急、多數大進口商稱、其貨物價格、並不高於七月二十六日凍結令頒布以前、惟承認零售商、已將價格抬高百分之一百五十至二百、實則存貨並不缺乏、因最近庇亞士及柯立芝總統輪抵滬時、進口商有貨、均有補充、然情形發展、已達怪誕地步、如皮革商人買進煤斤、棉花商人囤積捲烟、凡屬小規模商人、幾無不兼行副業、囤積貨物、待善價而沽、</p>
<p>局方應有　負責措施</p>
<p>進口商人對於此種情形、表示反對、表示願零售、但彼等承認無法統制多數小商人活動、本身爲受害之衆、當及早覔取自衛的實際辦法、一方制止商人獲非法利潤、同時勿依據恐怖心理、競以高價增購貨物、曾有人建議購買者、應實行組織採直接行動、抵制不遵照公平合理價資出售貨物之商店、但我人不能同意、惟主張市民實有聯合一致破壞商人壟斷牟利之心理、應由工部局出而主持、並得進口商人協助、將各種進口物品價格、與願照定價出售之商店名稱公布、深信市民必歡迎此種措施而擁護之、設能成爲事實、現時所高抬之價格、不久當可下跌、而各方必有良好反響、</p>
<h3>游資內移日增　兌價變動</h3>
<p>近數月來、上海游資內移、漸增多、各川幫銀行創辦此期想出款以後、奬勵游資內移、故滙款往重慶昆明貴陽等地者日見增多、此可由滬渝滙兌之變動而證實、查以前上海滙款赴渝、僅須交法幣七百元、即可在渝昆收取一千元、但最近則已漲至須申交八百七十元、始能在渝或昆明收取一千元、</p>
<h3>三總統輪　更名為將軍號</h3>
<p>范盤倫號將處女航抵此　滬美貨運更趨密接無疑</p>
<p>美國總統輪公司總公司頃決定該公司所屬三輪均更名、批亞士總統輪更名爲施高塔將軍號、克利扶倫總統輪更爲白禮士將軍號、塔虎塔總統輪更爲好勃魯克將軍號、其中三輪來滬日期、據航業界消息、均大致決定、白禮士將軍號的下星期由南洋來滬駛美、好勃魯克將軍號定十一月中旬駛美、施高塔將軍號於十二月初旬由滬駛往舊金山、最近期由滬駛美船隻、據悉爲戴勒德統輪、該輪現正滯馬尼刺、抵滬日期、聞爲十月二十七日、共由舊金山來滬赴港者、爲范盤倫總統輪、（Van　Buren）該輪係本年新近完成者、載重一萬六千噸、凈重九千四百噸、建築高闊、式樣新頴、爲克利扶批亞士等輪所不及、處女航來滬日期、在本月下旬、美國在遠東與太平洋航輪、將益增加、滬美航運、更見密接、</p>

<h3>滬客乘輪赴港　繳保證金</h3>
<p>兩輪公司等　辦法不相同</p>
<p>自香港政府宣佈撤銷外埠代理人簽發香港臨時入境證之特權後、嗣後旅客赴港、除執有中國護照或正式入境證外、須繳納現金保證、新聲社記者昨向英商太古怡和兩輪船公司及中國旅行社探悉、（一）太古公司規定繳納現金保證、官房艙五十元、大菜間一百元、吊舖統艙二十五元、（均以港幣計算）此項現金、以港幣現鈔或英美各銀行函給之滙票交納均可（二）怡和公司對收取保證金辦法不予接收、凡購買該公司各輪船票赴港者、非備有護照或正式入境證不可、（三）中國旅行社爲便利旅客計、擬向旅客直接收取保證金、俟抵港辦妥入境手續後、得向港社退回保證金，此事已與港移民局磋商、尙未蒙接受、該社已往代旅客謂領之香港六個月入境證、頃已決定即日起停止代領、靜待港方來電後冉定繼續與否、但仍得代領護照業務、蓋持有護照者、可在港登陸</p>
<h3>滬市近郊　獵區縮小</h3>
<p>滬日軍發言人宣布上海近郊行獵之新條例、謂欲行獵者、須於十一月一日以前、向上海日駐軍司令申請、而日軍保留事前並不通吿、即禁止在任何區域行獵之權、本季准許行獵之區域、較去歲爲小、北起蘇州河、南止於黃浦江、東起虹橋飛機塲以西約三哩、西止於經觀音堂與松江等地一直錢、全區略呈長方形、</p>
<h3>國醫平民醫院　盼望各界捐助</h3>

<h3>第十二次學術講座　江振聲主講（三）</h3>
<p>Ｄ（生物體內之和協）生物體內各部分是分工合作的、食物皆知由消化液所消化、但消化液之分泌、有藉神經與刺戟素的動作互相台作、使食物充分消化、故各器官之運動及整個生理活動皆甚和協、</p>
<p>Ｅ（生殖）生殖之意義、能使個體增多、種族保存、即目母體之一部分造出子嗣、生殖有八種方法、無性生殖中如變形蟲一分二地不斷增殖、稱爲「分體法」、靠芽而生殖的稱「出芽法」、能再生一部分出來者稱「造子法」有性生殖中有「接合法」、係接合雄與雌所產生之生殖細胞完成一個個體、一般動物的卵必待與精蟲合體後始能生子、卵與精蟲的合體稱「受精法」、某種物動不待精蟲的合體、卵能自己發育稱「孤雌生殖」、這不過是一種例外、水中動物受精大都在體外行之、至烏及陸上動物、則在體內受精、如人類所行者稱幼體生殖」、倘有「世代交替法」、即有性生殖與無性生殖之交替、但大概低級生物之生殖率超過高級生物、猪能產一窠、而人產一或二而已、</p>
<p>Ｆ（生長）生長是增加體量、是體細胞分裂之結果、細胞分裂亦即增殖、分裂數量越多、細胞越是衰弱、到結果大部分停止了分裂、不過停止了分裂不是說立刻就是死去、然經過若干期間、終不免泯滅、低級生物之再生能力較高等爲强、因低級生物構造簡單、易復元癒台、</p>
<p>Ｇ（刺激與感應）刺激是生物受外界之刺激、即生背或白之反應、以　要生物體內個性之基礎感應隨動物之進化而差別、如下等動物僅有生理之感覺、但嗅味一覺已發達、高等動物之人類、尙有審美推理等理智、以及言語表情等精神上之感覺、故視聽兩感官極發達感覺之差別、與下列四點有關係、即大腦之膜發達與吾、神經系構造之複雜與簡單、紳經細胞之人小腦之輕重等、</p>
<p>Ｈ（適應環境）適應環境之日的、欲求生存、對於常變之環境作種種之適應、以調整其自己與其環境、爲求個體之生存及種族之保護、</p>
<p>三·結論</p>
<p>關於生物個性之某礎、研究如下、（一）細胞各部有精密的排列、（二）細胞分裂有一定的變化、（三）生體內有特殊的化學成分、故生物是和協的、完整的、進化的、向上的、（完）</p>

<p>最近希特勒為了要振作國內民氣起見，特地于戎馬怱忙之際，回到柏林去廣播他的「罪己詔」。道决演講的功效如何目不必說，可是使希特勒元首大煞風景的是，收聽他演講的人，都聽見裏面夾雜着混亂的俄國話。這種神秘聲音，大家都稱之為「恐怖伊凡」，—恐怖伊凡者，原是十六世紀俄羅勘的殘暴沙皇。今日死沙皇和活元首的聲音，居然能同在一處聽到，收聽希特勒演講的聽衆，眞是耳福不淺了。</p>
<p>德國廣播所受的搗亂，還不止這一椿，近來德國國內的新聞節目中，常常有別處來的德國話夾雜着，雙方一應一答，儼然是在唱雙簧，結果把德方所宣傳的新聞破壞得體無完膚。這裏可以舉一些例子：</p>
<p>新聞報告：德軍又獲大勝……</p>
<p>揷膏：勝在墳墓裏。</p>
<p>報告：蘇機十五架被擊落……</p>
<p>揷言：德國飛機呢？</p>
<p>報告：德機昨夜又大舉出動……。</p>
<p>挿言：可有一架飛回原防的？</p>
<p>報告：英機企圖襲擊……</p>
<p>揷言：豈最豈最。</p>
<p>報告：義大利空軍襲擊英艦……</p>
<p>揷言：不要叫人笑痛肚子了。</p>
<p>報告：元首大本營發表公報稱……</p>
<p>揷言：除了謊話，還有什麽別的？</p>
<p>報告：新聞報告完畢。</p>
<p>揷言：謊話明天繼續廣播。</p>
<p>差不多德方每報告一句新聞，後面就跟着一句揷言，這樣使得郭培爾啼笑皆非，宣傳效力全失。後來調查出：這些揷言乃是來自蘇聯强力電台ＲWL—位在距莫斯科三十哩的挪琴斯克（Noginsk），至於同德國新聞報告唱雙簧的，有人猜是前奧國記者費歇，也有人說就是蘇聯外交人民委員會副委員長盧索夫斯基，因為盧氏非但精通德語，而且也歡喜開玩笑。</p>
<p>德方極力想把這些揷言排除掉，可是總沒有辦法。有一决他們把新聞報告得非常之快，一口氣都報告完；使得人家無從揷嘴。這樣雖然不成了雙簧，却成了急口令，聽衆裏面有那一個聽得出是在報告些什麽呢？</p>

<h3>滿足了的欲望　我得了一個教訓</h3>
<p>— 思鳳過</p>
<p>是一個春天的下午，我躺在廊下的弔床上，讓溫暖的太陽蓋著全身，畫眉鳥在石榴樹上不斷地叫着，和煦的春風吹得我薰薰欲眠。大哥和表哥的談話聲不斷地在我耳旁喧聒着，那聲音是平淡地，斷續的，似乎永無休止的樣子，我的睡夢被攪亂着，心裏很不高興。</p>
<p>「我有」天會自殺的，表哥忽然說。我不禁奇怪起來。表哥是外公的獨生孫子，他的生活是我們大家一向羨慕的，會想到自殺，「是的，自殺，」他接著說：「我的生活有什麼意義呢？沒有競爭，沒有慾望，義要什麽，就得到什麼………」他忽然停止了，放低了聲音，「除了刺激，生活的刺。」說完了，他抓了帽子就走了。找驚奇地望着大哥，他苦笑了一下，正色對我說：「滿足了慾望是苦惱的。」我想體味一下這話的意義，可是我就睡着了。</p>
<p>一天晚上，我從學校裏回家去，心裏很輕鬆，隨意地東看西望，一個很亮的燈光刺激着我的眼睛，順眼看去，那是一個首飾店的橱窗，裏面排列着許多飾物，在許多翡翠，瑪瑙，珠子，項圈中間，我看見一個小小的象牙戒指，彫刻得很是精緻，戒面彫着一只小蝦蟆，張着嘴叫的樣子，神氣這眞，眼，嘴，舌，以及背上的花紋，都很淸楚，戒指的周圍也全彫羞花，有莖，有葉，讓黑色的絲絨盒子襯托着，更顯得潔凈可愛。我看那大小正和我手指相合，我很想買牠，可是那標着的價錢比我袋裏所有的零用錢大了許多，看了一回，只好回去。</p>
<p>回到家裹，我告訴母親；請求她替我買來，可是我被拒絕了。母親說我不應該花道些錢去買這種小玩意。我聽了心裹很不高興，佔有的慾望更增强了，我一定要得到牠，我想我可以節省了我的車錢和點心錢去買牠。</p>
<p>從此每天早晨我很早起來，預備走到學堂去，下午也常步行回家。我忍了肚子餓，不買點心。母親笑我，不許我這樣；我就瞞着她。我雖然覺得苦，可是心裏很開心。我走過那橱窗，總瞟一眼那個戒指；，想着我不久就可以戴牠了。兩個禮拜以後，我帶了錢，走到那橱窗門口的時候，那戒指不見了。店裏的夥計告訴我，他們早兩天賣去了，我心裏像澆了盆冷水；一口氣跑回家去，母親問我的時候，我幾乎要哭出來。</p>
<p>過了幾天，我跟母親到嬸嬸家去玩，無意之閒看見嬸嬸的手上戴着那個戒指，胖胖的手，紅潤的指甲，白色的小蝦蟆爬在上面？可愛極了”我不禁叫了起來。母親看我變呆的樣子，立刻全明白了。就笑着把我的故事，告訴了嬸嬸，嬸嬸聽了大笑起來，「好吧，旣然你道麽喜歡牠，我可以送你。不過有一個條件，你要幫我抄好三部金剛經，我七月裏要用的。不然，我就不送。」</p>
<p>抄寫金剛經，是最枯燥的事；用那毫無黏性的朱砂，在粗糙的黃紙上寫字，是很困難的。那些字句往往是毫無意義，而且重複的。寫完三百個字，手腕就會酸起來，眼睛會不山目主地合上去。可是我終於耐着性子，寫完了三部金剛經。想起那象牙戒指，似乎有一種力量鼓勵着我。</p>
<p>廢曆七月半的早上，我拿到那戒指，心裏非常快活，連忙把牠帶在手指上，凝視了一回，忽然我覺得有些不順眼，我的手指很粗，手上露着很多的筋，和骨頭，我的指甲是禿的，蒼白的手帶着白色的戒指很粗得黯淡：我再看那小蝦蟆，怪蠢地躺在那裹，我想起了水缸後面的賴蝦蟆，覺得牠醜陋　了。我述忙脫下了戒指，把牠丟在抽屜裏。我懊恨自已為牠費了那麽大的精力。</p>
<p>我默默地躺在床上，想起了大哥的話：「滿足了慾望是苦惱的。」我想我現在懂得了這句話的意義。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十三　流浪到上海</p>
<p>「我那裏是為了道幾間破屋子發愁，實在是不知道應該逃到什麼地方去才好。因為我的錢已經剩得很少了，再想上別處去買地種田萬萬辦不到，所以直到今天還打不定走的主意。」</p>
<p>「爸爸，這倒不妨。」梅寳獃在旁邊聽他們說了半響，忍不住便插嘴上來說。。「我現在巳不是小孩子了，書也多少念了幾年，不論上什麼地方去，好歹總可以做一些事，幫你老人家一起過活。大概天要餓死咱們是不成的了！」</p>
<p>「三爺，眞的，不但梅寳姑娘念了這麽幾年的書，出去多少總可以賺幾個錢，就是你老人家自己，不是還會唱戲嗎？就算年紀大了，自已唱不成，給人家敎戲或是拉拉胡琴，不也就能吃飯了嗎？」小狗子萬分熱心地說。</p>
<p>秋海棠却還是搖頭。</p>
<p>「你們那裹知道！如今到處都在打仗，誰還有心思聽戲？」</p>
<p>「不，爸爸，例外的也有！寳昂起着頭，想了一想。「去年我還聽一位先生說，上海地方眞是天堂，法租界和公共租界要比天津的租界大幾十倍，到處是大菜館，戲院子；外面儘管打仗，住在裹頭的人，一些不必担心，祇要你有錢，仕麽事情都可以辦到！咱們如果祇想活下去，不問其他的話，上海倒是一條出路。」（二三七）</p>

<h3>各書塲秋擋健將（上）</h3>
<p>— 健凡</p>
<p>書塲慣例，每於新春中秋，聘請名家響擋，調整陣容。新春開書，名曰「年擋」，須說至端午左右方畢。中秋起始，名曰「秋擋」，則須說至年終。蓋此一時期，為書塲旺月，苟陣容堅强，生涯必盛。以是各書塲羅致書壇健將，互相競爭，可謂不遣餘力。滄州飯店之禮廳，旣已闢作書塲，以設備完善，座位舒適，常告客滿。張園機起於後，近亦新闢書塲，巳於雙十節開幕。此外尙有四馬路之大羅天，三年前曾一度改關書塲，惟為時甚暫，近復重闢夜書塲。光潤兩社之許話彈詞，增添地盤，大有復興之象。惟夏荷生與張鴻聲，已於半月前赴蘇獻藝；蔣如庭與朱介生，仍專隸電臺播音。普餘社之女彈詞家，僅重隸南京書塲之在梅韻，最為聽客激當。茲將各書塲秋擋陣容中具有號召力之評話彈詞健將，略述如下：</p>
<p>黃異庵擅說西廂記者，昔推朱蘭庵，淸言霏玉，迄猶臉炙人口。改編西廂脚本，去蕪存菁。辭藻緋麗，雅韻欲流！旋膺外埠各書塲之聘，所至有聲，甫於月前返滬。日塲隸湖園，龍泉樓，夜塲則隸南園，雅廬，及百花廳。除南園獨放單擋外，其他四書塲，均與其徒錢雁秋合拼雙擋。書藝之佳，無往而小引人入勝，聽客交口稱譽，朱蘭庵後，一人而已！</p>
<p>沈儉安珠塔響擋沈儉安，自與薛筱卿拆擋後，即携其得意弟子李念安往常熟無錫等地奏唱。者番重來海上，日塲隸張園，湖園，夜塲隸南園，百花廳，富春樓。儉安說表，簡潔輕鬆，唱疊句馬調，嗓音較前嘹亮，韻味深長！前程固未可限量也。</p>
<p>王綬章擅說果報錄之王綬章，為綬卿胞弟，四大名家之一王石泉之子。說表細膩。一絲不苟，允以「堂面書」，最擅勝塲。現隸滙泉樓日塲頭擋，足說一小時之久，斵輪老手，不同凡響，惜不為初嘗書味者注意耳。</p>
<p>「歌女紅牡丹」，為當年胡蝶紅極一時之傑作，現由其本人建議，重攝為有聲電影，由王次龍編導，王文龍吳楚帆王乃東等合演。明日起，即將繼「新姊妹花」後在大上海戲院公映</p>

<p>昨天下午二點鐀光路，三馬路外灘的江海關碼頭上擠滿了人羣，送行者似乎比較平時來得熱鬧，原來大半是的陌生送客，年青男女們都不約而同的期待着。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Nation's Perseverance: America Will Never Sacrifice China. Leedom Expresses Opinions on US-Japan Talks: Only Determined Struggle Can Remove All Shackles.</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Chiang Kai-shek's political advisor, Mr. Leedom, taking advantage of a brief respite from official duties, flew to Kunming yesterday to investigate the local political situation. He plans to return to Chongqing in about a week and later intends to visit the Northwest. Before his departure, Mr. Leedom received reporters from the Xinhua Daily and spoke broadly on various topics. He stated that the Xinhai Revolution was a revolution by the Chinese nation to seek independence and freedom. However, after thirty years, it is still bound by unequal treaties, which can be said to have failed to achieve its goals. However, since the beginning of the war against Japan, various countries have a much different understanding of China than before. China's international status has suddenly improved. Britain and the United States have also agreed to abolish the shackles of unequal treaties with China after the end of the war and the realization of peace. This is a true gain from the determined struggle, and it can also be said that the progress China has made in the determined struggle far exceeds the progress made in the thirty years of the Republic of China. Regarding the US-Japan talks, Mr. Leedom was unwilling to say much, only emphasizing that the United States would never sacrifice China, and the Chinese nation would never allow itself to be easily sacrificed. The Chinese nation itself has the freedom to resist unyieldingly, and it is not subject to manipulation by others. (Havas dispatch of the 15th)</p>

<h3>Details of the Japanese Army's Withdrawal from Changsha: Chinese Flanking Attacks Take Effect and Cut Off Japanese Rear Supply Lines. Air Force Strenuously Assists in Battle, Thus Turning Defeat into Victory.</h3>
<p>Guilin. Reporters from various newspapers who visited Changsha this time obtained valuable information that could not be obtained elsewhere. Although Changsha was lost, the Chinese military command in Hunan Province, confident in its ability to recapture the city, did not report the news of the city's fall to Chongqing. According to opinions from various Chinese circles, this is why Chongqing was unable to announce accurate news about the Changsha battle, and therefore the special features of the Chinese army's victory were not fully known. According to the reporters, when Kunlun Pass in southern Guangxi was lost, the local command also did not report it. Later, the Chinese army fought hard and recaptured the pass. Chinese circles said that this battle was the main reason for the Japanese army's withdrawal from Nanning after the Chinese army's efforts. It is a significant victory. Unfortunately, foreign sources are still unaware of this. Foreigners in Changsha all said that the Japanese army's attack on Changsha was intended to hold the city for a long time, but they lost it again, which can be called a major victory for the Chinese army. According to Soviet personnel in the Chinese army, about 20,000 Japanese soldiers died in the battle. British and American missionaries and doctors in Changsha also believed that at least eight or nine thousand Japanese soldiers died. After the Japanese army withdrew, they witnessed many Japanese soldiers' corpses in the streets of Changsha. Chinese circles all said that the battle of Changsha was enough to prove the combat abilities and morale of the Chinese army. In the early stages of the war, the Chinese army command had overestimated the strength of the Japanese army, but the Chinese army was still able to persevere and drive the Japanese army away. The Japanese army's crossing of the Xinqiang River was completely unexpected by the Chinese army. At that time, the Chinese army command believed that the Japanese army's gathering in the Yuezhou area was merely a feint. Until the Chinese army defending the Xinqiang River reported that the 3rd and 4th Divisions of the Japanese army were participating in the battle, the superiors still did not believe it. It was not until the Japanese army crossed the Luo River that it was known that the Japanese army was indeed advancing on Changsha with heavy troops. The Chinese side estimated that there were a total of 80,000 Japanese soldiers participating in the battle, and about 10,000 Chinese laborers were used to build roads. However, the Chinese army was not intimidated and continued to defend the positions north of Changsha until reinforcements arrived from the south and launched attacks from the west of the Hunan-Guangxi border, at which point they turned from defense to offense. It is reported that the defeat of the Japanese army was largely due to Chinese flanking attacks and the cutting off of Japanese rear supply lines, as well as the destruction of roads, which prevented the Japanese army from using the strength of tanks and artillery. At the same time, artillery support from Yuelu Mountain west of the Xiang River assisted the main force launching a counterattack from the west, and the air force also strenuously assisted in the battle, thus turning the situation around and turning defeat into victory. When the Japanese army entered the city, about 5,000 Japanese soldiers entered the city. Since the number was small, it was not enough to completely occupy the city, so they only occupied the northern and northeastern parts. This is why the news reporter group saw many places with no traces of war when they visited Changsha. Military observers all said that the withdrawal of the Japanese army from Changsha and the simultaneous offensive by the Chinese army in the Fifth and Sixth War Zones also played a powerful role, because the Japanese army attacking Changsha clearly had many troops transferred from these two zones. Military observers also believe that once artillery and aircraft are transported from the United States, the Chinese army will launch a general counter-offensive on all fronts, and will at least make a showing in the Yangtze River basin (Reuters dispatch of the 15th).</p>
<p>Changsha. Foreigners here are very suspicious today of what the Japanese are saying, that the Japanese army is from withdrawing from Changsha. According to foreigners, the Japanese commander in the city showed no intention of withdrawing a few hours before the hasty retreat. The Japanese army had installed telephones (which were still removed when they retreated) and registered foreign property. The day before the retreat, the Japanese army convened a meeting of British, American, and Norwegian personnel, requesting them to assist in organizing a refugee committee to encourage those who had fled to return to live and do business. A certain foreigner said that the street fighting was very fierce on the evenings of September 29th and 30th. On the morning of September 30th, the Japanese army was still fully present, but the next morning, not a single soldier was to be seen. The Japanese army came suddenly, and their departure was also sudden. However, the day before the retreat, the Japanese army gave flags to the hundreds of refugees in the refugee center of the Italian Catholic Church, ordering them to line up in the streets. Then, under the direction of the Japanese army, they filmed "the true image of Chinese civilians welcoming the Japanese army's entry into Changsha." It is known that after the Chinese army returned to Changsha, none of the four Norwegian overseas Chinese were forced to leave. Three German women, one of whom was ill, were also allowed to stay temporarily. Others did not evacuate. The Chinese authorities have taken over the property of the Italian Catholic Church, including a hospital, which has been allocated to the Chinese Red Cross. The disposal of German property has not yet been ascertained. (Special correspondent of the United Press in Changsha, dispatch from Spears on the 15th)</p>
<p>Changsha. All foreigners in Changsha said to me today that the actions of the Japanese army that entered Changsha on September 27th were extremely regrettable. According to a certain pastor, when the Japanese army first entered the city, they seemed very hungry. If there was anything edible or cigarettes, they would seize it. I saw a Chinese soldier whose throat was cut and who fell to the ground. The next day, the Japanese army began searching every residence and every shop in the city, and almost all of them were invaded by the Japanese army. Many Chinese people in the city other than those in the refugee centers were harmed. The records of Xiangya Hospital can serve as clear evidence of the Japanese army's actions. Before the Japanese army entered Changsha, the hospital's records only contained those injured by bombs. After the Japanese army entered the city, there were those stabbed by bayonets, those chopped by broadswords, those whose heads were severed but not completely, those injured by bullets, and those with other tragic injuries. The Chinese staff of the hospital had already evacuated, so the hospital only had three doctors and three nurses, about one-fifth of the normal number. Mr. Barth, a young American doctor who ran the hospital's refugee center, which housed a thousand refugees, performed an average of six major surgeries per day and 100 to 150 surgical treatments since the Japanese army entered Changsha. Assisting Mr. Barth were Mrs. Barth, a trained nurse, and two foreign doctors. I saw a Chinese civilian whose head and neck had been slashed with a knife, with the wound extending deep between the back of the neck and the spinal cord, leaving almost no space for a hair's breadth. Only the muscles on the front and both sides were still connected. The doctor believes he can recover. Foreigners in Changsha had planned to leave the city on the evening of September 27th, but the Japanese army had already entered the city that afternoon. During the four days that the Japanese army was in Changsha, foreigners had to guard the refugee centers and other foreign properties, and also had to search for food and treat the injured for more than 17,000 refugees. Someone said that there was some light fighting at night, and shells flew over the city. After one night, they set up beds in the cellar and lived in the cellar, but were unable to sleep due to nervous tension. I learned that the most difficult task was providing for the refugees. The refugees needed several tons of rice every day, but there was not enough rice in the impoverished refugee centers. Every day, pastors and volunteers formed teams, holding American flags, and went to shops in the city and suburbs to buy rice. The International Relief Committee also had rice stored in the suburbs. A certain pastor said, "Sometimes it was quite difficult, because the Japanese army was collecting rice for military use, and there were several disputes, but fortunately there were no serious results." The pastor also said that when the Japanese army entered the city, chickens, ducks, and livestock were unattended and scattered everywhere. We led them into the refugee center to provide meat. We know that their owners will also allow it. We also held flags and went to unattended vegetable gardens to pick vegetables to supply the refugees.

<h3>Severe Cold and Snowfall in Soviet Territory: German Forces Intensify Offensive in Central Sector</h3>
<p>Soviet Reinforcements Strive to Defend Moscow: Battle for Kalinin Unprecedentedly Fierce</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 10th. According to the latest news, the German offensive against Moscow has slowed down significantly. They are now consolidating their positions and dispatching fresh troops to the front lines to assist in the battle. On the Red Army side, large numbers of reserve troops are also being transferred to the front lines as reinforcements, most of whom are troops from Siberia. These soldiers are well-trained and disciplined. The Soviet side hopes that winter will arrive early. Fortunately, it has now begun to snow, and the weather has suddenly turned cold. The Red Army is accustomed to this and will not be affected by the weather, but it will obviously be difficult for the German army to say the same. Even in the southern Ukrainian region, the climate has turned cold, causing the German army's operations to suffer a major blow. As for Moscow, the people are calm and determined, so everything is as peaceful as usual. However, the sound of artillery from the Vyazma battle area can be faintly heard, because after the German army occupied the city of Vyazma, it advanced rapidly towards the city of Mojarsk, only fifty miles away from Moscow. In the Orel battle area, both sides are fighting to the death, and the battle is unprecedentedly fierce. The Red Army troops commanded by General Timoshenko are bravely defending Moscow, and all are fighting with all their strength, which is extremely壮烈. As for the Leningrad battle area, the Red Army is launching a large-scale counter-offensive under the cover of tanks and aircraft, in order to disperse the strength of the German army. However, due to the fierce German artillery fire, the Red Army has not yet been able to break through the German army's positions.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from New York on the 15th. A comprehensive report from the German-Soviet front yesterday stated that the brutal battle determining the fate of Moscow is unfolding on a semicircular battle line 300 miles outside the Soviet capital. It is said that the Red Army is currently resisting the German army's attempt to push forward towards the front lines through the snow-covered eastern areas.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Moscow on the 15th. The German army attacking Moscow today has launched a fierce assault on Kalinin (also known as Tver). Kalinin is located 100 miles northwest of the Soviet capital and is the center of the railway between Moscow and Leningrad, making it an important transportation hub. The German army, following the Smolerisk highway, apparently wants to establish a third stronghold in Kalinin, in addition to the two strongholds in Vyazma and Orel, in order to capture the Soviet capital from these three directions. Today's Soviet military bulletin is the first to mention Kalinin. Its wording indicates that before applying pressure to the Soviet capital's defenses, the German army wants to adopt a plan to shorten the central front line. Kalinin is located on the left bank of the Volga River and along the railway between Moscow and Leningrad, and is considered the closest route to capture the Soviet capital. (Note: Vyazma is 130 miles west of Moscow, Orel is 210 miles southwest of Moscow, and the German army currently pressing towards Kalinin is already 100 miles northwest of Moscow.) The city of Kalinin was built at the end of the 12th century and has a population of 100,000, making it the largest industrial center in the upper reaches of the Volga River. The importance of the city is due to its proximity to the Baltic Sea and its location along the Volga River, which flows through Stalin, Moscow, and other places. The German army's advance on Kalinin has made the threat of encirclement to Moscow even more imminent than before, and will make the defenders of the Soviet capital consider defending the rear of the exit east of the Soviet capital as their top priority. At present, the war in Vyazma and Brjansk is very fierce, and the German army is simultaneously rushing towards Kalinin, which is enough to indicate that the German army's attack on the Soviet capital is becoming increasingly tense.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Launches Fierce Counter-Offensive: 10,000 Aircraft Assist in Battle</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 15th. From Kalinin in the north to Orel in the south, it is reported that three army groups of fresh troops defending Moscow have joined the battle or are on their way. These troops are currently fighting fiercely against the German armored offensive and are assisted by 10,000 aircraft in battle, making their strength quite formidable. Major battles continue to take place near Mojaisk, west of Moscow. The advance troops of the German army, which were driven out yesterday, seem to have reoccupied the city.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 15th. According to news received here, the German army in the Vyazma area, despite suffering heavy losses under the strongest resistance from the Soviet Union, has made considerable progress. The German side claims that the Soviet army in the area has been completely annihilated, while the Soviet side says that it is currently launching a fierce counter-offensive. General Timoshenko is rushing troops to deal with the new German offensive from Kalinin towards Moscow. This offensive threatens communication between Moscow and Leningrad, and the Germans may attempt to encircle Moscow from the north. The battle for the Moscow railway is on a vast scale, and both sides are mobilizing fresh troops to participate in the battle.</p>
<p>Results of Annihilation Battle in Central Sector: 150,000 German Soldiers Killed</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 14th. According to news from the Soviet Union, the results of the annihilation battle in the Brjansk and Vyazma battle areas are that 150,000 German soldiers were killed, 450,000 were wounded, and a large number of officers and soldiers were captured. It is expected that the Red Army under the command of General Timoshenko, commander of the Central Red Army, will vow to resist to the death to defend Moscow. At present, the climate has turned cold, which is very beneficial to the defenders.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 15th. The German High Command issued a special announcement from Hitler's headquarters, stating that the Soviet army encircled in the Vyazma area has been completely annihilated, and the Soviet army encircled in the Brjansk area is also nearing collapse. In these two battles, the German army captured over 500,000 enemies, and the number is increasing daily. The total number of Soviet prisoners has thus reached over 3 million.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Berlin on the 14th. The German News Agency recently released news stating that when the Soviet army retreated from Vyazma, it set fires, and the streets were desolate, with only ruins and broken walls visible. The landmines buried by the Soviet army have been removed by German engineers.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Admits Southern Red Army Retreats from Mariupol</p>
<p>TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 15th. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a communique stating, "On October 14th, our army fought with the enemy along the entire line. The battle situation in the Vyazma, Brjansk, and Kalinin areas was fierce. After several days of fierce fighting, our army retreated from Mariupol (in the Azov Sea region of the Southern Front). On the 12th, 80 German aircraft were destroyed, 27 of which were shot down in air battles, and another 62 were destroyed on the airfield. We also lost 23 aircraft."</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Moscow on the 15th. The Soviet Union's announcement of the abandonment of Mariupol has allowed the German army to advance to within 100 miles of Rostov. Rostov is the main objective of the German army's attack on the Azov Sea region, and is an important industrial and metallurgical center. It is reported that the fall of Mariupol has given the Germans a stronghold to attack the Donets Industrial Region from the flank, and has made Rostov, one of the Soviet Union's most important strongholds, feel even more threatened.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Prepares for Long-Term War</h3>
<p>The Elite Troops of the Far Eastern Red Napoleon Will Deploy Along the Volga River Valley</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Vichy on the 14th. Observers here commenting on the Soviet war situation are all asking whether Stalin, if forced to retreat from Moscow, will transfer the "secret army" trained by General Blücher, the former commander of the Far Eastern Red Army, to Europe to assist in the battle. (Blücher is also known as General Galen, nicknamed the Red Napoleon of the Far East). His troops can establish a defense line in the Volga River valley, 160 miles east of Moscow, and resist the enemy before the river freezes. Although the combat effectiveness of his troops is kept secret, it is believed that they are indeed an elite force. According to unconfirmed reports, the secret army has been transferred from its garrisons along the Heilongjiang River to the foothills of the Ural Mountains, 1,200 miles east of Moscow, to set up a defensive line. Note that there are three railways connecting the Far East to the Volga River valley.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Newspaper Comments: The German-Soviet War Situation: Soviet Strength Should Not Be Underestimated</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 15th. The "Japan Advertiser," known as the mouthpiece of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, commented on the German army's offensive against Moscow, saying, "Although the Soviet army has suffered heavy losses, it is still very formidable. At this time, one should not make premature judgments that the German-Soviet war is nearing its end. It should be known that a strong reserve and vast land can still be a source of continued resistance. If the Soviet Union adopts a purely defensive posture, it will not be difficult for the Germans to advance, but only an offensive posture can have any real strength. The coming weeks will be able to show whether Moscow has this counter-offensive capability."</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Talks Still Without Clue: U.S. and Japan Inevitably Headed for War</h3>
<p>Norris Claims War Against Japan May Not Be Harmful; Japan Also Expresses Impatience with Prolonged Negotiations</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 15th - The Washington Post stated in yesterday's editorial that as a result of German victories in the Soviet Union, Japan's willingness to reconcile with the United States has waned, and war may be unavoidable. The newspaper said, "The general trend of Japanese policy now seems to be moving away from 'moderate' and towards action." The newspaper believes that Japan's decision to withdraw its expatriates in the United States and its current anti-American press opinion may be an attempt to force "the United States to yield." The newspaper said that if so, Japan is greatly mistaken. The United States is unlikely to waver in its position due to any such actions by Japan.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Washington, 14th - Senator Norris, a Republican from Nebraska, stated that if Germany defeats the Soviet Union, a war between the U.S. and Japan is imminent. A war against Japan may not be harmful to our country, as Navy officials have told me that our country can destroy the Japanese fleet within fifteen days. Norris also said that if Germany wins, Japan will obstruct American shipping, which the United States cannot tolerate. It is noted that Norris voted in favor of U.S. participation in the European war when it was decided.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 15th - Domei News Agency today quoted well-informed Japanese sources as saying that if the United States continues its deceptive tactics, taking a hostile attitude towards Japan on the one hand and engaging in diplomatic negotiations with Japan on the other, it cannot be allowed to delay any further. Domei said that observers pointed out that forty-nine days have passed since Prime Minister Konoe sent a letter to President Roosevelt, but there is still no clue regarding negotiations on the Pacific issue. Britain is constantly strengthening its U.S.-British-Chinese-Dutch encirclement of Japan, rapidly expanding its military, and will organize a new offensive against Japan, inviting Britain and the Soviet Union to participate. Under the above circumstances, it can be said that the United States has taken the lead in order to complete the anti-Japanese encirclement. It is highly doubtful that the United States sincerely hopes to maintain peace in the Pacific. If Japan remains careless and continues its current negotiations, it will inevitably fall into the trap set by the cunning United States.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 15th - The pro-German association organized by pro-Germanist Nakano submitted requests regarding diplomatic issues to Prime Minister Konoe and Foreign Minister Toyoda today.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 15th - Kokumin Shimbun today warned that Japan must prepare to face any eventuality with "absolute determination." The newspaper said that British and American aid to Chongqing is hindering Japan from establishing a new order in East Asia, and that the Soviet Union is now being forced to retreat eastward, threatening the East. "In order to cope with this future situation, we must have absolute determination to prepare."</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th - "Chugai Commercial News," which usually reflects the opinions of Prime Minister Konoe and Baron Hiranuma, wrote an editorial today expressing regret over the possibility of a U.S.-Japan conflict. The editorial said, "We Japanese have never dreamed of a conflict between the U.S. and Japan. There is no reason for conflict between Japan and the U.S." It also said, "Frankly speaking, we are not satisfied with the situation and wish to make demands, but we believe that there are no unsolvable problems and there is no need for conflict." The newspaper finally said that if the U.S. and Japan conflict, the responsibility lies entirely with the United States, so "we have told the United States that it should consider the situation, but if the war extends to the Far East, Japan will suffer, because the United States does not care much about it."</p>
<h3>Suzuki Visits Konoe for Important Talks</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - Lieutenant General Suzuki, Director of the Planning Board, visited Prime Minister Konoe at 10:15 last night due to important current affairs and talked until 12:30 this morning. The official first went to the Prime Minister's official residence at 5:30 yesterday afternoon, then met with Army Minister Tojo, and then went to the Prime Minister's private residence at 10:15 in the evening. The Prime Minister happened to be at a banquet somewhere, and he waited for an hour until the Prime Minister returned home, and then had a long conversation.</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes in Japanese Army and Navy</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - The Army Ministry announced that Lieutenant General Tanaka, Commander of the Military Police, has been appointed Commander of the Tokyo District. The vacancy will be filled by Lieutenant General Nakamura, the former Director of the Military Affairs Bureau. Colonel Mabuchi, Director of the Army Intelligence Department of the General Headquarters, has been appointed Commander of a certain unit. The vacancy will be filled by Colonel Ohira, an instructor at the Army Academy. Colonel Sato, Chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Military Affairs Bureau, has been promoted to Major General and transferred to the Central Army Arsenal. He is the first Chief of the Military Affairs Section to be promoted to Major General.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - The Navy Ministry has appointed Rear Admiral Masao Kanazawa as Chief of Staff of the Yokosuka Naval Station. Vice Chief of Naval Staff Rear Admiral Seiichi Ito has been promoted to Vice Admiral.</p>
<h3>Nazi Party Members Go to Thailand; Japanese Ambassador Recalled</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - Responsible sources here today stated that according to news from Singapore, two well-known Nazi party members seem to have been dispatched to Thailand as representatives of the German government. One is Winter, the former German Minister to Bolivia, and the other is Hube, who represents Germany in Tokyo. If the German government attempts to incite disputes between Britain and Japan in Thailand, these two are well-suited for the job. It is noted that Winter was forced to leave Bolivia in haste after his plot to overthrow the current government was discovered. Hube once served as a police advisor to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 15th - The first Japanese ambassador to Thailand, who presented his credentials only a few weeks ago, has now been recalled by the Japanese government to review the true state of Japanese-Thai relations. The diplomatic community here is naturally surprised by this. It is generally believed that this move must be related to the current situation in Thailand and the recent trends in Japan's views on the Soviet-German war and the development of the Far East. It is noted that there have recently been anti-British and anti-American arguments in Japanese newspapers, saying that Britain and the United States are alienating Thai-Japanese friendship. The ambassador was recalled at this time, so the diplomatic community here and the Thai government are paying close attention to it. According to observers, the current situation in Thailand is characterized by the Thai government's determination to be impartial and treat all countries equally, regardless of the consequences. Thai Acting Foreign Minister Vanichai replied to reporters' questions, saying that he did not consider the recall of the Japanese ambassador to be unusual, but hoped that the ambassador would not make unfavorable reports about Thailand.</p>
<h3>British Government Telegraphed Chiang to Congratulate on National Day</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons today that the British government had sent a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek on Double Ten Day to express warm congratulations and wish China well for the future. The British government has not recently exchanged messages with the U.S. government in an attempt to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese war. China has had a very good response to the Atlantic Charter. The British Ambassador to China has telegraphed Chongqing about the enthusiastic welcome, and the Chinese Foreign Minister has also issued a statement expressing his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Mongolia and Manchukuo Sign Boundary Survey Agreement</h3>
<p>Reuters, Changchun, 15th - According to officials, the necessary documents regarding the Manchurian-Outer Mongolian boundary survey agreement were finally signed this morning by representatives of both sides in Harbin. The boundary line is 300 kilometers long.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Tatsuta Maru Sets Sail for America</h3>
<p>Carrying More Than 600 Passengers; Japanese Nationals Evacuated from Singapore Return Home</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - According to Japanese sources, the "Tatsuta Maru" set sail from Yokohama at 5:00 this afternoon, heading for San Francisco via Honolulu, carrying a total of 610 passengers, of which only 5 are Americans. It is reported that 250 passengers will disembark in Honolulu. It is noted that the Japanese government recently agreed with the U.S. government to send three ships to the United States to transport Japanese nationals back to their country. The Tatsuta Maru is one of them. The remaining two ships are scheduled to set sail on the 20th of this month.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 15th - 362 Japanese nationals evacuated from Singapore, including 147 men, 33 women, and 92 children, arrived in Kobe at 11:30 this morning on an evacuation ship.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Soviet-German War and Japan</h3>
<p>The battle around Moscow is now reaching a fever pitch, and the ultimate fate of the Soviet capital is a matter of universal concern. However, upon careful examination of the current situation, while the Soviet-German war is indeed worrying, the degree of its danger may not be as great as that in the Far East. First, both the Soviet Union and Germany have the idea that they will perish if they do not win, and this feeling is even stronger on the Soviet side. Therefore, not only is there little possibility of compromise, but the Soviet side is also bound to use every last bit of its strength in this battle and will not easily allow the painstakingly managed system to suffer the misfortune of being fundamentally eradicated. Second, British and American aid to the Soviet Union is proceeding with great determination towards a huge goal, and in addition to war materials, the issue of sending troops to help fight has also been considered. If the Soviet Union unfortunately falls into a state where it cannot support itself, then the U.S. war against Germany will inevitably materialize immediately, just as it did in the previous decisive war after the Soviet Union and Germany cease hostilities and then enter the war. Moreover, there are many thorns in the path of the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union. This newspaper's editorial yesterday has discussed this in detail. There is ultimately no reason to be pessimistic about this situation. In the Far East, however, if the situation deteriorates, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union may fall into the possibility of fighting on two fronts, and the danger to the Soviet Union may be greater than the threat of troops approaching Moscow. American public opinion has been paying the greatest attention to this in recent days. Although Ambassador Wakasugi's return to the United States has led to continued contact between the two sides, it has apparently not alleviated the general public's anxieties.</p>
<p>Japan's enthusiasm for worshiping the Nazis has been far less than in the past six months. The outbreak of the Soviet-German war has allowed the Japanese authorities to feel bewildered. Although the cabinet was reorganized once and it was rumored that a multifaceted response plan had been drawn up, it does not seem to have alleviated their indecisive predicament. Recently, Japanese public opinion has not been very interested in the victory of the Nazis, and they are even harboring a faint hope that the Soviet Union can contain the Nazi offensive. This kind of mentality is actually not surprising. Of course, the Soviet Union's defeat is an opportunity for Japan to advance north, but on the other hand, if the Soviet Union really collapses, then the Nazi forces will inevitably move eastward, whether south into the Indian Ocean or east into the Pacific, which will be a major threat to Japan's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." If the Soviet Union continues to resolutely resist after its retreat in Europe, it will use its Asian territory as its main base. In addition to the route through the Persian Gulf, the port of Vladivostok, which is adjacent to Japan, will become the Soviet Union's most important external passage, which is what the Japanese side is most unhappy about. Therefore, putting oneself in Japan's position, the most favorable situation for it is the Soviet Union's defeat without retreat, and the rapid depletion of its strength, so that it has no choice but to mobilize its Far East garrison to the west. At that time, if Japan implements a northern advance, it will be easy, and a southern advance will not have any worries. The hundreds of thousands of troops stationed in the Northeast may as well be transferred to any place that needs reinforcement. Compared to waiting for the Nazis to win an absolute victory and then sharing a piece of the pie as an ally, this is naturally better.</p>
<p>However, if the Soviet capital falls, then no matter how the Soviet-German war turns out afterwards, Japan will inevitably take action in eastern Siberia to fulfill its desire for expansion or "self-defense." Even if this move cannot be compared in essence to the Soviet Union's invasion of Poland two years ago, it is similar in form and has the same inevitability. In the past two months, the Japanese authorities have never been willing to give up thinking about how to relax (in fact, it is just delaying) U.S.-Japan relations. The Chugai Commercial News, which represents the views of Konoe and Hiranuma, also stated in an editorial: "We Japanese have never dreamed of a conflict between the U.S. and Japan. There is no reason for conflict between Japan and the U.S." As for how Soviet-Japanese relations will develop in the future, the Japanese government has maintained a mysterious silence for the past few months, allowing some extreme arguments to clamor incessantly. The message in this is worth pondering.</p>
<p>In recent U.S.-Japan relations, the United States is letting Japan choose its path after completing the necessary preparations. However, there are some loopholes in the preparations that the U.S. has made, such as the unprotected state of the North Pacific. Therefore, from another perspective, Japan is still in a proactive position, and the power to decide whether the Far East crisis will erupt is actually in the hands of the Japanese. At present, the ABCD line and the Soviet Union's strength in the Far East should not be underestimated, but they must firmly grasp the proactive position in order to fully control the development of this dangerous situation. Even if the Soviet-German war may have new and favorable turns, we must still plan for the worst-case scenario in the Far East.</p>
<p>War Talks in Europe</p>
<h3>A True Account of the Moscow Air Raid</h3>
<p>Moscow Subway Station</p>
<p>This is a wireless telegraph report from Ms. Purple, a Moscow correspondent for Collier's Weekly in the United States, during the air raid. It is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Moscow has suddenly felt the impact of the war. After four weeks of silence, it is difficult for people living in Moscow to believe that the greatest battle in history is taking place hundreds of miles away, like a wildfire. Then the bombing began. The explosions of anti-aircraft guns, the roar of machine guns, and the sound of collapsing walls caused by incendiary bombs filled Moscow. However, the general public remained unmoved, believing that the bombing had just begun and that they would be bombed every night for many weeks to come.</p>
<p>For the first four nights (July 23 to 26), German planes always came between 10:00 and 10:15 every night, without fail. On the fifth night, we waited until midnight. The daytime was very peaceful. Although reconnaissance planes often flew over near dusk, the air defense authorities decided not to sound the alarm to avoid causing too much disturbance. The working hours during the day were not hindered at all, and the evening entertainment continued unabated. People strolled in the streets, and the restaurants and theaters were still crowded. They had dinner quite early and went home immediately at almost ten o'clock. They packed their bedding, ready to take it to the nearest air-raid shelter or tunnel when the alarm sounded. According to the newly promulgated regulations, women and children are allowed to spend the night in the tunnels before enemy planes arrive. These underground stations, built with marble from the Ural Mountains, have long been a source of pride for Muscovites, but now they are of great use, which was not expected at the beginning. As soon as the Russian people heard the broadcaster say that ominous word Trevoga (Russian for alarm), followed by the sound of sirens, they would not hesitate to find a place to hide. As soon as I stood on the balcony, I saw people pouring into the square from all the streets and pouring into the tunnels from the square. In less than ten minutes, the streets were deserted. This haste and urgency is due to the fact that the authorities are now very strict and must find shelter before the alarm sounds, rather than entirely due to terror.</p>
<p>I changed my lodging every night, changing the environment, so that I could get a clear and detailed view of the situation at that time. The first night I was in the tunnel, the second night in the apartment of a British news writer, looking out from the window, I could overlook the north and south sides, the third night in a hotel in the city center, with the windows facing west, and the fourth night in the residence of the American ambassador. The place where I am writing this manuscript is twenty miles outside the Russian capital, in the residence where the two ambassadors live together. This house is built of white-painted wood and is located in the countryside, surrounded by trees, with beautiful scenery. The garden is planted with famous flowers such as hollyhocks, zinnias, and snapdragons. I came here in the morning and suspected it was a paradise, but I heard the alarm in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I was locked in a closed room to prevent the lights from shining out. Just as I was writing at my desk, I suddenly heard the sound of anti-aircraft guns, which was deafening. I rushed out of the house, to the balcony, and everyone was looking up, watching the searchlights protruding and penetrating through the clouds, searching for enemy planes, sometimes shining on the roof of the house. Suddenly I heard the rattling sound of a bomber engine, but after a while it disappeared. Undoubtedly those planes had fled back to their base.</p>
<p>On the first night of the air raid, I was about to undress and go to bed in the hotel when I heard the sound of the alarm. I hurriedly put on my shirt and ran straight to the underground military station in the square below. Although there had been an alarm once in the morning, it lasted a short time and there were no incidents. Now there were more people in the tunnel than in the morning, but there was no pushing and shoving. Everyone quietly walked into the entrance and down the steps. Under such circumstances, there was naturally no need to buy tickets. They wandered back and forth on the platform, chatting and killing time.</p>
<p>I saw photographer Jogli leaning against a stone pillar and sitting on his precious camera case, so I greeted him. Before long, everyone was ordered to go down into the tunnel. We tried to slow down our pace as much as possible, hoping to be the last to go, so that we would be closer to the entrance of the tunnel and the air would be better. However, the police enforced the order very strictly, so we had to squeeze in with a group of people and learn from them to spread the newspaper on the tracks and sit on the ground.</p>
<p>Our foreign language was heard, so we became suspects and were taken to a small shed for questioning. A militia captain was sitting in the shed, with a telephone next to him, which rang incessantly all night. He asked us to show our passports, checked them, and then let us go.</p>
<p>Although I was questioned, I was not annoyed, because this was the fourth time I had dealt with the local police. Those three times happened when I was with friends who lived near the American ambassador's residence.</p>

<h3>US Aid to Soviets Tripled</h3>
<p>September Transfers Totaled $155 Million</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th - President Roosevelt stated yesterday while hosting news reporters that the transfer of goods under the Lend-Lease program in September tripled the monthly average of the past six months. The September transfer totaled $155,000,000, while the total for the previous six months was only $146,000,000. The authorities are prepared to immediately use the current supplemental Lend-Lease funding of $5,985,000,000, as the original $7,000,000,000 in funding has already been allocated, leaving only 5%. He yesterday sent a letter to Lend-Lease Administrator Stettinius, approving the use of the remaining funds, including goods in production or being processed. The Lend-Lease expenses for September totaled around $2,000,000,000. This aid is given to Britain, China, South American countries, and Polish and Norwegian people. Since March, the average monthly actual orders under the Lend-Lease program have been $700,000,000. Since the outbreak of the war, the $5,000,000,000 in exports to Britain have all been paid for in cash. Currently, a large portion of exports to Britain are still paid for in cash, as they were ordered before the start of the Lend-Lease program. However, the goods under the Lend-Lease program are now steadily increasing in shipments to Britain. When asked if the Soviet Union needed assistance under the Lend-Lease program, the President replied that he did not know, and would only have an opinion after meeting with the US Chief Representative to the Moscow Conference, Mr. Harriman. When asked if the Soviet Union was currently requesting financial assistance from us, the President replied that the Soviet Union was currently procuring goods in the United States as usual, paying for the goods half in cash and half in important minerals such as manganese.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that the situation on the Soviet front did not cause him to doubt the success of the US program to aid countries resisting the Axis powers.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Actual Sales or Stagnation? Speculation Still Focuses on "Double Horse" Brand; Futures Follow Factory Orders Closely</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains volatile and uncertain, with significant fluctuations, due to the large number of trading chips in the market, preventing stability. Actual transactions are sluggish, but speculative activities have driven prices up with significant waves. The morning opening for "Double Horse" 20-count factory orders suddenly declined, claiming a loss from the previous afternoon's close, creating an illusory situation. The first trade of the morning took advantage of this, pressing the price down to 2,150 yuan, a drop of 50 yuan. This opening triggered a rush of buyers, quickly pushing the price up to 2,185 yuan. Subsequently, news of a flat opening at the exchange, followed by a decline, created a looser sentiment. Shortly after, the price dropped to 2,130 yuan, showing weakness. However, there was more to it than met the eye. Unbeknownst to many, the price slowly rose to 2,175 yuan. However, actual yarn transactions remained sluggish, and prices for miscellaneous brands also declined, with even fewer transactions. The price on the trading floor fell back to between 2,140 and 2,150 yuan. Subsequently, the afternoon close showed a sudden tightening, and Blue Phoenix brand yarn rebounded, leading "Double Horse" to a positive close at 2,179 yuan. In off-market trading, the price rose another 10 to 20 yuan. The afternoon opening was enthusiastic, claiming tight exchange rates, pushing the price of "Double Horse" to 2,205 yuan. Coupled with the exchange opening, which jumped 30 to 40 yuan, "Double Horse" factory orders were further strengthened, reaching a new record high of 2,228 yuan. Later, the momentum waned, returning to 2,180 yuan, before closing back up to 2,190 yuan. It is reported that the total volume traded for the day was 13,400 bales, all purely speculative transactions.</p>
<p>The "Golden Double Horse" futures market turned from weak to firm, presenting a bullish uptrend. Although there were no clear prospects from various parties, people remained determined and mostly optimistic. Therefore, the foundation of yarn futures was soft but stable. At the initial opening in the morning, factory orders opened at a lower price, but due to the slow movement of the buying side, which instead absorbed orders aggressively, the market immediately rose. Yarn futures initially followed the weakness of spot prices, with the October contract opening at 1,950.00, a slight drop of 12 yuan. The November contract opened at 1,964.00, a slight increase of 4 yuan. The December contract opened at 1,970.00, another decrease of 10 yuan. Midday saw a sudden surge in factory orders, briefly pushing up futures prices as well. However, the exchange rose and then fell, causing general speculators without a firm foundation to collapse with the wind, suddenly shifting to selling, causing the near-term contracts to fall to 1,945.00, the October contract to 1,950.00, and the far-term contracts to a slightly lower 1,958.00. Later, prices steadily increased. The afternoon saw a surge in momentum, with short sellers lacking the strength to support their positions, engaging in short covering. Coupled with the unrelenting buying pressure from the bulls, the market rose in tandem with other yarn markets. The October contract reached a high of 1,990.00, the November contract reached the 2,000 yuan mark, and the December contract reached a high of 2,020.00. Although the closing was slightly similar, the near-term contracts still rose 18 yuan, while the far-term contracts rose by 34 to 45 yuan. The details are listed below:</p>
<h3>Cotton Not Easy to Fall</h3>
<p>The cotton market remained stable as usual. Upon inquiring with various parties, the general response was that prices would not easily fall. Cotton brokers still held an optimistic view of Lanchow coarse cotton, leading prices to increase by another six to seven yuan. Although transactions from factories were not numerous, trading among dealers remained robust.</p>
<p>Qiebin Cotton: 100 bales, No. 661.0 from Home Broker</p>
<p>Omra Cotton: 100 bales, No. 566.0 Again</p>
<p>Again: 300 bales, No. 539.0 Again</p>

<p>Again: 100 bales, No. 530.0 Again</p>
<p>Again: 200 bales, No. 529.0 Again</p>
<p>American Penjia Poe Cotton: 300 bales, No. 696.0 Internal and External Factories</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to fund selling, but later rebounded due to buying in New Orleans and short covering. As a result, closing prices were up seven to eight points from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to the negative impact of the war, followed by mass selling. However, it subsequently rebounded due to buying by European exporters and short covering. As a result, yesterday's closing prices rose by about one to two rupees each. It is also predicted that the market will open higher by half a rupee today.</p>
<h3>Finance: Gold Market Rises Sharply After Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market in the black market surprisingly defied the weakening exchange rate, reversing its decline and trending upwards. Cash prices fluctuated repeatedly, breaking through the 11,000 yuan mark and then falling back below it. The market was uneasy. Initially, due to the reported weakening of exchange rates, market sentiment was weak, and the price fell to a low of 10,700 yuan. Soon after, two Chinese banks secretly started buying again, and Hong Kong banks continued to absorb supply. Tianjin banks, which had dumped over 1,000 taels the previous day, suddenly started buying again, driving up prices. At noon, the price rebounded to the 11,000 yuan mark. In the afternoon, Shanghai West banks also started buying, pushing the price to a high of 11,360 yuan. Later, upon hearing of a decline in yarn prices, selling pressure increased, eventually pushing the price back down to 11,200 yuan, still up 200 yuan. The total volume traded for the day was about 910 taels. Securities firms and money changers successively bought October gold certificates. There were more buyers than sellers of drafts, and the price rose from a morning opening of 8,200 yuan to 8,540 yuan, a gain of 270 yuan. The volume traded was about 2,000 taels. Ornamental gold initially fell to 1,100 yuan, but later rose to 1,150 yuan before settling at 1,140 yuan, up 10 yuan.</p>
<p>11,000 Yuan In and Out</p>
<p>Spot gold in the black market rose after falling, entering and then breaking out of the 11,000 yuan mark. The morning started with a decline, continuing the previous day's weakness. Wanfeng sold 10 taels to Jufengyong for 10,750 yuan, down 250 yuan. Then, Wanfeng offered 10 taels to Yongfengyu at an even lower price of 10,700 yuan. Tianyuan, Heshengde, and Da Lai aggressively bought, pushing the price to 10,900 yuan, up 200 yuan. Then, Tianyuan started selling again, and Yongchengyi, Yuanhecheng, and Dafeng competed to sell, causing a drop of 70 yuan. Tianyuan offered 100 taels to Xiangyu and Yong at 10,830 yuan. Xiangyu and Yongfengyong bought, and then Defu bought again. Shixiang and Hexiang also bought. At noon, the price rose even more sharply, rebounding beyond the 11,000 yuan mark, up 300 yuan. Xiangyu sold 20 taels to Xianghe, and Defu sold 10 taels, pushing the price to 11,130 yuan. After Xiangyu sold again, the noon close was pushed down to 11,100 yuan. In the afternoon, Defu came back to cover shorts, immediately pushing the price up 180 yuan, and then began buying 30 taels to Gonghe at 11,280 yuan. Hengji sold at 11,270 yuan. Deda, Mingfeng, Defu, Tianyuan, Tongkangyong, and a certain jewelry store bought, pushing the price up another 90 yuan. Litai bought 20 taels from Decheng, and Tianyuan and Yongcheng bought 10 taels each, reaching 11,360 yuan. Yongcheng, Chengda, Gonghe, Xiangyu, and Xianghe competed to sell, causing another drop of 160 yuan. Finally, Decheng sold 10 taels to a certain gold shop, and the evening close was 11,200 yuan, up 200 yuan from the 10th. The daily range was 660 yuan. After the close, there were sellers at 11,180 yuan. The total volume traded for the day was about 910 taels. The retail price of gold bars at gold shops was 11,300 yuan, 300 yuan higher than the buying price.</p>
<p>Futures Sentiment Positive and Promising</p>
<p>Since the morning, the October contract (10 taels) opened at 9:30, down 50 yuan, at 8,200 yuan. Dafeng aggressively bought, immediately pushing the price up to 8,280 yuan. Suddenly, Chengda, Hengji, and Xinfengyong began selling, immediately reducing the price by 60 yuan, to 8,220 yuan. At noon, due to the rebound in cash prices, the price also rose to 70 yuan in the buying spree of Shunyuan, Hesheng, Xiangxing, and Yongchi, resulting in the noon close price. The afternoon opening was down 20 yuan, at 8,450 yuan. Shunyuan and Dafeng aggressively bought, immediately pushing the price to 8,540 yuan. Hengji and Cheng hurriedly sold to 8,770 yuan. Finally, due to the positive sentiment, Dafeng and Tianyuan bought, and the 4:00 PM close was 8,520 yuan, a rebound of 270 yuan. The daily range was 340 yuan.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Retreated and Then Advanced</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at jewelry stores: Datonghang and Xintonghang initially listed at 30 yuan lower at 9:30 AM, at 1,100 yuan. Shortly after, the price rose three times, listing at 1,140 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, the listed price rose to 1,150 yuan, and the 4:00 PM close was 1,140 yuan, up 10 yuan. The buying price was reduced by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rumors of USD Supply Alter Black Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC listing all exchange rates flat. HSBC and other smaller counters remained unchanged. The black market rates for GBP and USD unexpectedly reversed and rebounded, after exporters sold USD at 3.375 to a certain bank. Suddenly, rumors circulated that HSBC was supplying USD, and the price had fallen back to the edge of the 30 yuan mark. Importers adopted a wait-and-see approach, suspending activity. Exporters and Chinese merchants had an offer of USD 5,000 at 3.50, but there were no buyers, and the trend was towards a decline. The noon close was 3.625, but it was not certain that it could be sold at that price. GBP was 2/1875, down 25 from the previous day's evening close. GBP long was down 1.25. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th (Wednesday) - This morning, the foreign exchange market opened with unusual sluggishness, and there were no significant changes in any exchange rates. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 15th (Wednesday) - This morning, the foreign exchange market opened flat. The London telegraphic transfer rate remained unchanged. The New York telegraphic transfer rate was tighter by 0.125, at 4.875. The Shanghai exchange rate was down by 0.50, at 95 yuan. The black market rate for "Federal Reserve Notes" was down by 1.125, at 43.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>USD Plunges, Abundant Supply Where Profit Lies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw relatively stable GBP and gold pounds. There was strong demand for GBP drafts, and market prices surged by six yuan. USD drafts saw a sudden drop in sentiment after a certain bank sold through the interbank market, with rumors circulating that the bank had a large supply of USD. The evening market had retreated to 30.07, a drop of 0.50 from the previous day. The supply and demand for Hong Kong drafts was relatively balanced, and market prices remained stable. Gold yen drafts remained at the original price of 2.60. Korean drafts showed a slight upward trend, rising to 2.11 in the evening market.</p>
<p>In other news, the USD draft, after gradually retreating from a peak of around 35 yuan to just over 31 yuan, fell further to just over 30 yuan yesterday afternoon. The reason for the decline is said to be that in Hong Kong, each USD draft is only worth around 24 yuan in legal tender. Some people, seeing the potential for profit, are privately carrying USD 50 and 100 drafts (in small numbers) to Shanghai to sell. Each USD 100 draft can generate a profit of 600-700 yuan in legal tender. It is easy for each traveler to carry a few USD 100 drafts. As long as there is money to be made, they don't care about the danger. The decline in the USD draft is not unrelated to this.</p>
<h3>Securities: Chinese Stocks Show Glimmers of Prosperity, Domestic Bonds Suffer Another Setback</h3>
<p>The black market for government bonds was initially firm yesterday but then weakened, and sentiment remained uncertain. Although Sichuan banks had stopped selling, overseas Chinese suddenly offered spot sales, and the bond market, which had shown signs of recovery, suffered another blow. Class C bonds once again broke through the 70 yuan mark. In addition, the breakdown of US-Japan talks added to the market's weakness. The situation is that whenever there is a decision to rise, spot goods flow out, so the future is not easy to be optimistic about. In the morning, Xinhua, Xinzhi, Lianhe, and Tiansheng bought Class C bonds, opening at a price 0.40-0.50 higher. However, Hengkang, Yitai, Tongshun, and Jiufeng sold, and the noon close returned to 0.40 higher. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to buy, and Lianyi, Tongshun, Shengxing, and Niuda bought. Class C bonds opened at 0.06 higher, 0.02 better than the noon close. However, Jiufeng, Runde, Yitai, Xiexing, Yuanrenchang, Tongkang, etc., sold on behalf of overseas Chinese or financial institutions, causing the price to fall in a straight line from 0.06, plunging by more than one yuan. The initial budding was damaged again, and the 70 yuan mark was broken again. As a result, except for Class B bonds, which were slightly higher by 0.05, other types declined by 0.20-0.30. The total volume traded was approximately 1.8-1.9 million yuan. A simplified table of Chinese listings is below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 200 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of 19 yuan per share. Recently, there has been extremely high demand for various Chinese stocks. Yongchang alone has registered demand for no fewer than dozens of types, such as financial stocks: Zhejiang Xingye at 200 yuan, Jin City at 190 yuan, Salt Industry at 200 yuan, China Reclamation at 105 yuan, Guohua at 97.5 yuan, and Guohuo at 80 yuan; textile stocks: Qingfeng at 230 yuan, Guangqin at 175.5 yuan, and Wing On at 230 yuan; pharmaceutical stocks: Wuzhou at 215 yuan, Zhongxi at 100 yuan, and Xinya at 51 yuan; ABC Underwear old shares at 18 yuan and new shares at 16 yuan; others such as Commercial Press at 210 yuan, China Bookstore at 115 yuan, Longzhang Paper at 110 yuan, China Cement at 100 yuan, Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate at 260 yuan, Tianli Light Gas at 95 yuan, Meilin Canned Food at 200 yuan, Great China Rubber at 200 yuan, China Coal Mine at 200 yuan, and Guanshengyuan at 95 yuan. These are just the most prominent examples, and the demand is extremely high, but there is no supply. As for the other small stocks, the demand is also high. This only refers to Yongchang's agency. Other firms can be inferred accordingly. The stock market has become prosperous, entirely due to the continuous rise in prices.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association stock market was also active, with a trend from stable to firm. Multiple stocks rebounded. Reclamation and planting shares saw the largest volume, with a high price of 56 yuan and a closing price of 55.5 yuan. Asian shares also reached a high of 24.25 yuan, but quickly retreated by around one yuan. Rubber shares trended weaker but rebounded slightly at the close.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Tuesday) - Today, Chinese foreign bonds and the listed prices of British companies in the Far East were generally flat. Only the shares of the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China rose by 1 shilling and 3 pence, to a price of £9.50. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Oil Merchants Persist in Manipulation, Edible Oil Rises as Soon as It Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday's edible oil rose as soon as it fell. Initially, the market was quiet due to sluggish actual sales, and sentiment was weak, causing prices to fall by 4-5 yuan. Subsequently, buyers emerged at low prices, absorbing supply and causing prices to rebound, resulting in a similar outcome as before. It is reported that 40 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 50 barrels of soy oil, 130 loads of Qing oil from Dayou Factory, 200 loads of rapeseed oil, 400 loads of rapeseed oil from Taishan Factory, 500 loads of rapeseed oil from Lide Factory, 2 loads of rapeseed oil from Dasheng Factory, and 100 barrels of rapeseed oil from Rihua Factory were sold.</p>
<h3>Grains: Major Holders Reluctant to Sell Much, Rice Prices Do Not Fall Significantly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the surge in foreign rice prices was thwarted, and market prices across the board rebounded to flat. However, major holders were still reluctant to sell in large quantities, and new, smaller speculators were still trying to profit from small price fluctuations, so market prices did not fall excessively. The market opened in the morning with news that a 2,000-ton deal for foreign rice had been settled, calming sentiment. There was also talk of the Municipal Council agreeing to a price of 39.76 for 2,500 tons of small grain via telegram. In addition, there was a supply of public warehouse small grain and publicly sold small grain in the local market. Actual sales sharply decreased, and the customer market was also sluggish, making speculators timid. The market once sharply declined by 3-5 yuan in a selling spree. Subsequently, short covering and inventory accumulation caused the market to rebound. Small grain from external warehouses once fell to 130 yuan, and the noon close price was 132 yuan. The afternoon remained at 132 yuan, slightly lower by 2-3 yuan from the previous day. Yinghua's immediate shipment of small grain was 161 yuan, and spot goods were 154.5-153.5 yuan, also slightly lower by one yuan. By the close, grade 1 Saigon high-grade rice rebounded to 148 yuan, ordinary to 146 yuan, middle grade to 143-144 yuan, grade 2 to 132-134 yuan, grade 1 Siam to 142 yuan, grade 2 white to 131 yuan, and falling to 129.5 yuan. Mintang high-grade rice was 140 yuan, 138 yuan, middle grade 135-133 yuan. Java top-grade special was 143 yuan, and ordinary was 140 yuan. Broken top-grade ranged from 108.5 yuan, falling to 105.5 yuan. 500 tons and nearly 10,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Hanyang vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying a batch of foreign rice from Hong Kong, totaling 13,877 bags, of which 11,700 bags were low-priced foreign rice for the Municipal Council. The vessel docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, and unloading began yesterday afternoon. (Ancestral)</p>
<p>The market for new and old japonica rice was mixed, with some prices rising and some falling. As new rice from Xixin went to market, the supply of new goods increased, no less than 200-300 stones. However, local store sales were limited, so supply exceeded demand, and the market could not stand firm, depreciating by about 2 yuan. It is reported that Kunshan new japonica was 153-154 yuan, and Qingjiaoya species was 153-154 yuan. The situation for Nangang early broken rice was the opposite. As the end of the season approached, inland inventories were running out, so there was a risk that deliveries would not be sustained. However, store sales had broad needs, often feeling that supply was insufficient. Because this situation was different from that of new rice, it was able to stand firm, without any significant changes, continuing to open at 157-154 yuan. New Shejian was lacking in supply and there was no market.</p>
<p>Although the supply of glutinous rice was also scarce, market prices have already risen repeatedly, and the market has reached sufficient levels. Therefore, the pullback in foreign rice prices caused retail demand to stall, and prices fell by one or two yuan. Hong Kong white high grade rice opened at 150 yuan, and dropped to 157 yuan. Glutinous tea was only specially offered at 144 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer Market Takes Advantage of the Flat Prices to Re-Accumulate; Foreign Vermicelli Rebounded in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the foreign vermicelli market was quite flat, with prices hovering around 0.30-0.20 yuan. In the afternoon, customer market dealers and major holders took advantage of the flat prices to re-accumulate inventory, and the market rebounded again, with Gold Dragon vermicelli seeing the most vigorous buying and the strongest gains. In the morning, West Warehouse Gold Dragon was only 38.8-39 yuan, but in the afternoon, it rose to 39.6 yuan. In the East Warehouse, it was only 39-39.12 yuan in the morning, but it rose to 40 yuan in the afternoon, both up nearly one yuan from the previous day. Cannon brand was 40.05-40.05 yuan in the morning, and 40.07 yuan in the afternoon, also up by nearly half a yuan. Double Eagle was 39.1 yuan, Red Sun Day was 39.5 yuan, Clock Tower was 39.05 yuan, Fortune God was 39.2 yuan, and Five Swallows rose to 39.7 yuan. Total volume traded, including internal and external, was no less than 50,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Bran and Wheat Supply Still Lacking</h3>
<p>Bran has been rising continuously. Yesterday, customer market dealers continued to raise prices to accumulate inventory, and small bags rose by one yuan to 41 yuan. Due to scarce inventory, holders called for 42 yuan across the board.</p>
<p>Deliveries of wheat have been limited for several days. Holders have repeatedly engaged in speculation, and major factories such as Rihua have found it difficult to buy. Yesterday, a small factory offered a new high price of 65 yuan, managing to secure 1,300-1,400 bags of high-quality wheat.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Dominated by Speculation; Few Actual Sales, Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was flat yesterday morning, but suddenly rose in the afternoon due to the influence of the speculative market. There was little actual buying, but holders' momentum suddenly strengthened, and prices were uniformly raised. Inventory holders also re-accumulated inventory. As a result, coarse cloth and twill rose by 0.50, fine cloth rose by 0.50-1 yuan, and the quoted prices for bleached and dyed cloth varied, also rising by around 0.50. Customer sales were limited to just over 100 pieces to the Yan-Jin gang in the North and 70-80 pieces of coarse cloth to the Dinghai gang in East Zhejiang. The local market remained dominant, with a total volume of about 800 pieces traded.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Futures trading at the exchange fell first and then rebounded. As a result, the current month's "Dragon Head" contract rose by 0.70, closing at 65.1 yuan. The November contract rose by 0.50, the December contract rose by 0.30, and the January contract only rose by 0.05. Therefore, based on the futures market, the increase was still soft, but the spot market was quite stable. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by about 1 yuan per piece.

<h3>The Authorities Should Swiftly Intervene in the Manipulation of Prices Using Their Powers</h3>
<p>Hoping the Municipal Council Will Adopt Strict Measures, Importers and Citizens Are Willing to Assist</p>
<p>Foreign Public Opinion Strongly Supports the Current Foreign Exchange Management System</p>
<p>Since the black market for foreign exchange sharply contracted on the 13th, creating an unprecedentedly tense and chaotic situation, the greedy speculators have raised the prices of daily necessities again, greatly impacting people's lives. Therefore, all parties, both Chinese and foreign, are very worried. By yesterday, the value of the legal currency saw a rebound, and the black market exchange rate eased slightly. US dollar bills fell from 35 yuan to 30 yuan. However, food prices, which rose by 10% on the 14th, remained firm yesterday. If the relevant parties and the authorities in this city do not quickly find ways to remedy this serious situation, the future is truly unimaginable. The English-language "Finance &amp; Commerce" weekly, published in this city, has considerable authority in discussing economic issues. Yesterday, it published two articles: one supporting the current foreign exchange management system, and the other suggesting the real reasons for rising prices and ways to remedy them. Both articles are notable for discussing the serious issues mentioned above. One of them stated that the Chinese authorities would never abandon Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Amount of Legal Currency Has Not Increased</p>
<p>The purpose of foreign exchange management is to maintain people's livelihood and industrial development, but not to waste it on non-essential goods. The Exchange Equalization Fund stipulates a preferential exchange rate to maintain the price level before July 26th. However, unscrupulous merchants are using various excuses to raise prices, which is not the fault of the Exchange Equalization Fund. It is hoped that the authorities can adopt strict measures to deal with this during this extraordinary period to alleviate the suffering of the people. Another article stated that the amount of legal currency in circulation has not increased, and the claim of currency inflation is demonstrably inaccurate. Now that merchants are using the excuse of reduced foreign exchange supply for non-essential goods to raise prices, they should be punished quickly. First, it is hoped that citizens will immediately stop purchasing and hoarding goods. Second, the Municipal Council should, in conjunction with importers, announce the prices of various imported goods and the names of stores willing to sell at prices fixed with legitimate pure profit, in order to stop hoarding for profit. It is believed that there will be a good response. The gist of the two articles is excerpted below.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Market Must Be Maintained</p>
<p>The gist of the article "Supporting the Current Foreign Exchange Management System" is roughly as follows: First, the Chinese authorities will never abandon the Shanghai market. As evidenced by past facts, the Chinese government is unwilling to abandon Shanghai to the Japanese, so it can be seen that it will continue to support it, but with limitations. At the same time, it is also extremely concerned about all situations that may affect the lives of Shanghai citizens and industrial development. Much of Shanghai's trade is very helpful to the wartime economy of Free China and the coastal areas. The final destination of most imported goods entering Shanghai is still Free China. At the same time, most of the factories in this city accept orders from customers in Free China. The Chinese government is doing its utmost to maintain the Shanghai market, but does not want to waste a penny on non-essential goods. The value of the legal currency of Free China does not need any support, because the arbitrary value of the legal currency for foreign trade has been recognized by friendly countries (i.e., Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union). The legal currency of Free China is a tool for clearing international accounts and a standard for implementing barter trade. The extent to which the supply of foreign exchange for essential goods to Shanghai must be maintained so as not to harm the main interests of Shanghai can only be proven through experience. We must be able to wait for the trial period to pass.</p>
<p>Export Bills Should Be Provided</p>
<p>The main question worth studying is how to obtain export bills of exchange in British and American currency from exporters. Cooperation with banks in democratic countries has now been achieved. All exporters in democratic countries will sell their foreign exchange to their domestic banks, so that the Exchange Equalization Fund can cope with it abundantly. However, most exporters only provide a small portion of their export bills of exchange, and some do not provide them at all. On the other hand, some export firms allocate huge amounts of their foreign exchange to maintain their foreign branches. At the same time, insurance premiums and exporters' investments must also be deducted from export bills of exchange. The following figures are very important for estimating the foreign exchange currently required by the import industry in Shanghai. Shanghai's trade with the British pound, US dollar, and Dutch guilder group has an average monthly loss of US$44 million this year. This loss is only theoretical, and the actual loss this year is more than this number. In the first eight months of this year, the total value of Shanghai's imports from the United Kingdom, the United States, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and India was US$88.6 million, and the total value of exports was US$53.5 million. In 1940, the total value of imports was US$100 million, and the total value of exports was US$37.7 million. If we compare Shanghai's trade deficit in 1941 with that in 1940, this year's deficit is US$35.2 million, and last year's deficit was US$62.3 million. Therefore, the progress in the trade balance between Shanghai and the British pound and US dollar group seems to be most noteworthy.</p>
<p>Price Standards Were Stipulated Earlier</p>
<p>In order to curb the rise in prices in Shanghai, the Exchange Equalization Fund, with the consent of the central government, stipulated a preferential exchange rate for legal currency. This decision on the preferential exchange rate for specially permitted imported goods aims to maintain the prices of goods imported from democratic countries at the level before the United States announced the freezing of Chinese and Japanese funds on July 26. In fact, all approved imported goods, except for slight increases due to freight and insurance premiums, are sold by foreign import firms at old prices. These importers mostly use various methods to obtain bills of exchange for prohibited imported goods, and sell them at high prices. Although stores and retailers continue to receive goods from importers at prices from July, these retailers have greatly increased their prices. They do not explain the reasons for the continued price increases. This is blatant monopoly profiteering and open exploitation. The general hoarders' refusal to release goods is also one of the reasons for the chaotic situation. Importers are not in a position to overstep their roles and interfere with their business. The only authority (the Municipal Council) still refuses to recognize its responsibility for this issue. In this extraordinary period, it must be dealt with with extraordinary means. The Municipal Council was granted greater powers by the ratepayers' meeting last spring, and is no longer restricted by ratepayers. It should quickly take new measures to adapt to the new needs. If the authorities in this city do not take any action, millions of Chinese and thousands of foreigners will undoubtedly encounter major misfortunes this winter. The developments in the past few days are very similar to the prologue to the great tragedy of hyperinflation experienced by the people of European countries in the years after the end of World War I in 1918. Investment merchants in this city are doing their best to get rid of legal currency, and most people are withdrawing their deposits, unknowingly becoming hoarders, which has led to rising prices. If this irrational state of terror continues to exist, the economic life of Shanghai will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Currency Inflation is Absolutely Inaccurate</p>
<p>The gist of the article "The Real Reasons for Rising Prices and Suggestions for Remedies" is that, due to the developments of the past week, it is believed that Shanghai has entered a period of currency inflation. This statement is not credible. The key lies in the lack of confidence in the currency, but those with long-term vision believe that it is completely unreasonable. Although legal currency cannot be used to freely purchase foreign exchange temporarily, is the Japanese military scrip any different? However, hoarders and speculators are accustomed to the effectiveness of Japanese military scrip, so they can maintain a favorable value. The smuggling of legal currency to Shanghai is an unwelcome and unfortunate situation. Now that the post office has prohibited remittances, the smuggling has gradually decreased. Therefore, it can be asserted that the amount of legal currency in circulation has not increased significantly in the past two months. At the same time, the exchange of legal currency for other currencies has been prohibited. However, in the months before the freezing order was issued, Chinese foreign funds had been sent back to the country, and the Chinese demand for foreign exchange was only for trade purposes. In view of the above circumstances, it is not enough to explain currency inflation.</p>
<p>The Hoarding Situation is Extremely Bizarre</p>
<p>Since the supply of foreign exchange applied for can be normal, the foreign exchange situation is gradually becoming clear. However, at the same time, Shanghai should also find ways to stop the continued rise in prices, which is the top priority. Most major importers claim that the prices of their goods are not higher than before the freezing order was issued on July 26. However, they admit that retailers have raised prices by 150% to 200%. In fact, there is no shortage of inventory, because when the President Pierce and President Coolidge recently arrived in Shanghai, importers had goods to replenish. However, the situation has developed to a bizarre point. For example, leather merchants buy coal, and cotton merchants hoard cigarettes. Almost all small merchants also engage in side businesses, hoarding goods and waiting for good prices to sell.</p>
<p>The Authorities Should Have Responsible Measures</p>
<p>Importers object to this situation and express their willingness to retail, but they admit that they cannot control the activities of most small merchants and are victims themselves. They should find practical ways to protect themselves as soon as possible, on the one hand to prevent merchants from obtaining illegal profits, and at the same time not to rely on terror psychology to compete to increase purchases of goods at high prices. It has been suggested that buyers should organize and take direct action to boycott stores that do not sell goods at fair and reasonable prices, but we cannot agree. We only advocate that citizens have a united mind to break the merchants' monopoly and profiteering, and that the Municipal Council should come forward to preside over it, with the assistance of importers, to announce the prices of various imported goods and the names of stores willing to sell at fixed prices. It is believed that citizens will welcome and support this measure. If it can become a reality, the current inflated prices will soon fall, and there will be a good response from all parties.</p>
<h3>Internal Transfer of Floating Capital Increases Daily, Exchange Rate Fluctuates</h3>
<p>In recent months, the internal transfer of floating capital in Shanghai has gradually increased. After various Sichuan banking groups founded this period and came up with loans, they encouraged the internal transfer of floating capital. Therefore, the number of remittances to Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang and other places is increasing day by day. This can be evidenced by the fluctuations in the exchange rate between Shanghai and Chongqing. In the past, remittances from Shanghai to Chongqing only needed to pay 700 yuan in legal currency to collect 1,000 yuan in Chongqing and Kunming. However, recently, it has risen to require 870 yuan to be paid in Shanghai to collect 1,000 yuan in Chongqing or Kunming.</p>
<h3>The Three President Liners Renamed General</h3>
<p>Van Buren's Maiden Voyage Arrives Here, Shanghai-US Freight Transportation is Undoubtedly Closer</p>
<p>The head office of the American President Lines recently decided to rename all three liners belonging to the company. The President Pierce has been renamed General Scott, the President Cleveland has been renamed General Breslin, and the President Taft has been renamed General Holbrook. According to shipping industry news, the dates of arrival in Shanghai of these three liners have been roughly determined. The General Breslin will arrive in Shanghai from Nanyang next week and sail to the United States. The General Holbrook is scheduled to sail to the United States in mid-November, and the General Scott will sail from Shanghai to San Francisco in early December. It is understood that the most recent ship to sail from Shanghai to the United States is the President Dollar, which is currently staying in Manila. The date of arrival in Shanghai is said to be October 27. The President Van Buren (Van Buren), which is coming to Shanghai and Hong Kong from San Francisco, is newly completed this year, with a deadweight of 16,000 tons and a net weight of 9,400 tons. It is tall and wide, and its style is novel, which is unmatched by the President Cleveland and President Pierce. The date of the maiden voyage to Shanghai is in late this month. American liners in the Far East and the Pacific will increase, and Shanghai-US shipping will become closer.</p>
<h3>The Situation of the Tax Negotiations in the Western District is Still Difficult to Disclose</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News said that it is rumored that the Municipal Council and the central district have made great progress after a long period of negotiations on the issue of tax revenue on cross-border road construction in the western district of the Public Concession, and that an agreement is expected to be reached soon. Regarding this statement, this reporter recently asked the spokesman of the Municipal Council, who replied that the talks between the two sides have not yet reached the stage where the Municipal Council can issue a press release.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Passengers on Ships to Hong Kong Pay Security Deposits</h3>
<p>Two Shipping Companies Have Different Methods</p>
<p>Since the Hong Kong government announced the revocation of the privilege of agents in other ports to issue temporary Hong Kong entry permits, passengers traveling to Hong Kong in the future, in addition to holding Chinese passports or formal entry permits, must pay a cash guarantee. A reporter from the New Life News Agency learned from the British Taikoo Jardine two shipping companies and the China Travel Service yesterday: (1) Taikoo Company stipulates that a cash guarantee must be paid, 50 yuan for official cabins, 100 yuan for large cabins, and 25 yuan for bunks in the third class cabin (all calculated in Hong Kong dollars). This cash can be paid in Hong Kong dollar cash or bills of exchange from British and American banks. (2) Jardine Company does not accept the method of collecting security deposits. Those who purchase tickets for the company's ships to Hong Kong must have a passport or formal entry permit. (3) In order to facilitate passengers, China Travel Service plans to directly collect security deposits from passengers. After completing the entry procedures in Hong Kong, they can return the security deposits to the Hong Kong branch. This matter has been discussed with the Hong Kong Immigration Bureau and has not been accepted. The company has previously applied for Hong Kong six-month entry permits for passengers, and has now decided to stop applying for them from today, and will wait for a telegram from Hong Kong before deciding whether to continue. However, it can still apply for passport business, because those who hold passports can land in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Hunting Area Reduced in the Suburbs of Shanghai</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the Japanese army in Shanghai announced new regulations for hunting in the suburbs of Shanghai, stating that those who wish to hunt must apply to the Shanghai Japanese Garrison Command before November 1, and the Japanese army reserves the right to prohibit hunting in any area without prior notice. The area allowed for hunting this season is smaller than last year, starting from the Suzhou River in the north, ending at the Huangpu River in the south, starting from about three miles west of Hongqiao Airport in the east, and ending at the Qian River, which passes through Guanyintang and Songjiang, etc., in the west. The entire area is slightly rectangular.</p>
<h3>The National Medical People's Hospital Hopes for Donations from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Medical People's Hospital at 88 Robison Road, Shanghai, was opened in July last year and has been in operation for more than a year. The number of outpatients is two or three hundred a day, and each patient is charged only two jiao for registration. The hospital also has 120 beds, and the number of inpatients is usually full. Those who can afford it are charged only one yuan per person per day for meals. In addition, medical and pharmaceutical expenses are not charged at all. It is purely charitable in nature. Inpatients have resident doctors on duty day and night to treat them, and nurses on duty day and night in shifts. As for sanitary facilities, everything is complete. Electric stoves are used for decocting medicines, which is clean. As for the spaciousness of the hospital buildings and the freshness of the air, it is the best among the hospitals in Shanghai. However, the monthly expenses are at least more than 10,000 yuan, which all depends on donations from philanthropists in Shanghai to maintain it. Recently, due to the high prices of rice, medicines, water, electricity, etc., it is difficult to make ends meet. It is hoped that all philanthropists will donate generously to maintain it for a long time, which is immeasurable merit.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Churches Strictly Prohibit Clergymen from All Over from Participating in Political Issues, Statement by the General Agent of the French Church</h3>
<p>The church groups in this city recently paid close attention to the news that the German missionaries in Changsha would be evacuated. De Tour, the general agent of the French Catholic Church in China, especially sent a letter to the North China Daily News yesterday, detailing the activities of the missionaries in Changsha. He said that the refugee hospital established by the Catholic Church in Changsha was founded by French nuns serving in the Hong En Hospital and the Sacred Heart Hospital in Shanghai and Father Rao, the host of the refugee area in Nanshi. Later, due to the evacuation of the French missionaries, German and Italian missionaries took over the work. The Shanghai Church authorities have stated that they strictly prohibit clergymen from all over from interfering in political issues, and all work is limited to religious and charitable undertakings. There are missionaries of 24 nationalities serving in Catholic churches all over China. Therefore, the fact that German missionaries echoed the Japanese planes flying over Changsha is a threat to the safety of German and Italian missionaries in Free China.</p>

<h3>Regarding Car Owners Purchasing More from Stockpilers, Leading to a Gasoline Black Market; Company Hopes Car Owners Will Not Disrupt Pricing Themselves and Wait for Sufficient Reserves to Eliminate Rationing</h3>
<p>A mainland report states: Yesterday (the 14th), it was learned that after the black market dollar price recently showed a tendency to rise, the gasoline black market also soared accordingly. Those selling gasoline on the black market are all gasoline stockpilers. Car owners, because the gasoline allocated to them each month is insufficient for their needs, purchase additional gasoline from stockpilers at high prices. Stockpilers, seeing the rise in the dollar price, then raise gasoline prices, at least doubling the official selling price. According to a certain employee of the Asiatic Petroleum Company speaking to reporters, they are also aware of the occurrence of a gasoline black market. This situation is actually caused by car owners purchasing additional gasoline from stockpilers. If car owners understand the oil company's point of view and follow the rationing system, they will not be exploited by stockpilers. The Asiatic Company is already aware that some employees at the company's various filling stations are stealing gasoline and selling it on the black market. The employee continued, The Asiatic Company now hopes that overseas gasoline will arrive, so that it can alleviate the tense gasoline situation here. At least three months are needed. This hope should encourage car owners in the city to conserve gasoline during periods of shortage. Once the company has sufficient reserves, it intends to cancel the rationing method. At the same time, it hopes that car owners will no longer purchase stolen gasoline, so as not to fuel criminal behavior and further reduce reserves.</p>
<h3>New Clothing Stores Temporarily Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>All employees of various new clothing stores on Fujian Road, New Road, Avenue Joffre, etc., once jointly went on strike last year due to unsuccessful requests for salary increases. Later, after the management agreed to salary increases, an agreement was signed and work resumed. A year has passed. Now, because of the increasing living expenses, the employees' livelihoods are feeling strained. They have jointly submitted another request to the management for an increase in wages and a series of increases from 1.3% to 3.3%. However, the management only agreed to three types of salary increases: 3%, 4%, and 5.3%. The labor side ultimately did not agree and firmly demanded an increase in the series. Because no agreement was reached, they announced a joint strike starting yesterday. All the new clothing stores were temporarily closed.</p>
<h3>Hartung's Estate: Lawyers Appointed as Managers</h3>
<p>Foreign news: After the death of Mrs. Hartung, Mrs. Kailing, the British side in this city is paying close attention to the management of Hartung's entire estate of $70 million. It is now known that the British Assessor's Office has issued a statement regarding the managers of the estate, having appointed two well-known British lawyers, Yifeng and Huai Te.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police in Pudong Jujuqiao Attacked; Several Gunshots to the Abdomen, Severely Injured</h3>
<p>Not long after Japanese soldier Murase was shot and killed near Caojialou in Pudong on the morning of Double Ten Day, another Japanese military policeman, Okamoto Yoshio, was shot at 9:45 a.m. on the 14th. According to the Japanese-language "Daily News," Okamoto Yoshio, the head of the Japanese military police detachment, was patrolling near Jujuqiao when a man wearing a hunting cap and a dark Chinese suit suddenly pulled out a pistol and fired several shots at him, hitting him in the abdomen. He collapsed to the ground, severely injured. The man then fled towards Jinjiaqiao and disappeared without a trace. The Japanese military police subsequently conducted a thorough search of the area.</p>
<h3>Two False Witnesses Blamed for Pushing Passenger to Death; Judge Formally Indicts; Separate Interrogation Indicates Remand for Further Review</h3>
<p>Wang Wanxiang, ticket seller number 358 on British-owned trolleybus number B-352 on route 20, was found to have pushed passenger Xiang Dongchuan out of the bus at Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road around 1:30 p.m. on September 13th due to pocketing fares, causing Xiang to fall and fracture his skull, resulting in death. After investigation by Judge Shi Meiyu of the First Special Court, Wang Wanxiang was sentenced on September 26th for injury resulting in death and sentenced to life imprisonment. During the trial of the case, a certain fugitive ticket seller and ticket seller number 241, Mi Baolin, instigated Yan Defa to testify falsely in court, attacking the testimony of eyewitnesses Jiang Jing and Xu Shenjin, claiming that the bus bell was rung by Jing because the passenger fell to his death, and fearing imprisonment, he came forward to testify. Subsequently, after Judge Shi, who was handling the case, discovered Yan's false testimony, he immediately detained him and handed him over to the prosecutor's office for investigation. Prosecutor Wu summoned ticket seller number 241, Mi Baolin, who again denied instigating Yan Defa to give false testimony, but the evidence was solid and undeniable. Prosecutor Wu then detained him as well. Yesterday morning, he filed a public lawsuit against Yan Defa for perjury, and against Mi Baolin for instigation. Judge Zhong presided over the trial, conducting separate interrogations for about an hour and a half. The defendants' testimonies differed, and they all tried their best to shirk responsibility, fearing punishment. After reviewing the circumstances, the court ordered them to be remanded and the trial rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Major Fire in Western Shanghai; Dozens of Factory Buildings Destroyed</h3>
<p>Around 8 p.m. last night, a fire suddenly broke out at the Hengxingtai Oil Factory, located at No. 30, Lujia Road, Anlì Temple Road in western Shanghai, due to a malfunction in the machinery motor. Thick smoke filled the air, and flames soared into the sky, quickly spreading to the surrounding houses. The fire brigade was alerted and dispatched vehicles to put out the fire, but the houses there were all constructed of wood and easily combustible, making firefighting difficult. After three hours of tireless firefighting, the fire was finally extinguished. It is estimated that the entire Hengtaixing Oil Factory building and approximately dozens of other buildings, including a tin can factory, bottle factory, and leather factory, were destroyed.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Joint Enrollment Results of National Southwestern Associated University, Wuhan University, Zhejiang University, and Central University; Poor Performance of Applicants, Only One-Quarter Admitted</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, Havas World Telegraph, 14th) Regarding the state of education in inland China, some educators are deeply concerned about the current state of secondary education. According to the joint enrollment results of National Southwestern Associated University, Wuhan University, Zhejiang University, and Central University, of the 6,706 applicants, only 1,788 were admitted after lowering the standards. Educators lament the decline of secondary education as a result. In terms of regions, Chongqing students were the worst, followed by Chengdu and Kunming. Hengyang and Guiyang were better. This shows that the local environment and living standards have a significant impact on education. The constant air raids in Chongqing have prevented students in various schools from attending classes on time, which is also one of the reasons for the poor performance. In terms of the majors sought by the applicants, only a little over 800 people aspired to enter the liberal arts and science colleges, accounting for one-seventh of the total. More than 2,000 people applied for law and engineering, and 1,436 for economics. Educators explain this by saying that there is an urgent need for engineering personnel in the nation-building effort, so hundreds of people apply to the various departments of the engineering college, which is a good phenomenon. As for the large number of people in the law and economics departments, this is because financial institutions and the business community offer particularly good treatment, which stimulates young people. It is not that young people in general have a special interest in these subjects.</p>

<h3>Twelfth Academic Lecture by Jiang Zhensheng (3)</h3>
<p>D. (Harmony within the Body): The various parts of the body cooperate with each other. Food is digested by digestive juices, but the secretion of digestive juices relies on the cooperation of nerves and hormones to fully digest the food. Therefore, the movement of each organ and the entire physiological activity are very harmonious.</p>
<p>E. (Reproduction): The significance of reproduction is to increase the number of individuals and preserve the race. That is, a part of the parent body creates offspring. There are eight methods of reproduction. In asexual reproduction, organisms such as amoebas constantly proliferate by dividing in two, which is called "binary fission." Reproduction by budding is called "budding." The ability to regenerate a part is called "sporulation." In sexual reproduction, there is "conjugation," which involves joining the reproductive cells produced by the male and female to complete an individual. In general animals, the egg must combine with a sperm cell before it can produce offspring. The combination of the egg and sperm is called "fertilization." In some animals, the egg can develop on its own without the combination of sperm, which is called "parthenogenesis." However, this is only an exception. Fertilization in aquatic animals mostly takes place outside the body, while in birds and land animals, fertilization takes place inside the body, such as what humans do, which is called "viviparity." If there is "alternation of generations," that is, the alternation of sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction. However, in general, the reproduction rate of lower organisms exceeds that of higher organisms. Pigs can produce a litter, while humans only produce one or two.</p>
<p>F. (Growth): Growth is an increase in body mass, which is the result of somatic cell division. Cell division is also proliferation. The more cell divisions, the weaker the cells become. Eventually, most of the divisions stop. However, stopping the division does not mean dying immediately. However, after a certain period of time, they will inevitably perish. The regenerative ability of lower organisms is stronger than that of higher organisms because the structure of lower organisms is simple and easy to recover and heal.</p>
<p>G. (Stimulus and Response): A stimulus is the reaction of a living thing to an external stimulus, which is the basis of individuality in a living thing. The response varies with the evolution of animals. Lower animals only have physiological sensations, but the senses of smell and taste are already developed. Higher animals, such as humans, also have intellectual feelings such as aesthetic reasoning, as well as spiritual feelings such as language and expression. Therefore, the two senses of sight and hearing are extremely developed. The difference in sensation is related to the following four points: the development of the cerebral membrane, the complexity and simplicity of the nervous system structure, the size of nerve cells, and the weight of the cerebellum.</p>
<p>H. (Adaptation to the Environment): The purpose of adapting to the environment is to seek survival. Various adaptations are made to the ever-changing environment in order to adjust oneself to the environment, in order to seek the survival of the individual and the protection of the species.</p>
<p>Three. Conclusion</p>
<p>Regarding the basis of individuality in living things, the research is as follows: (1) The various parts of the cell have a precise arrangement. (2) Cell division has certain changes. (3) The living body has special chemical components. Therefore, living things are harmonious, complete, evolved, and upward. (End)</p>

<h3>Joking with German Radio</h3>
<p>— Xia Chu</p>
<p>Recently, in order to boost domestic morale, Hitler made a special trip back to Berlin from the battlefield to broadcast his "self-criticism edict." The effectiveness of this speech is self-evident. However, much to the dismay of the Führer, listeners heard confused Russian interspersed within. This mysterious voice was universally referred to as "Ivan the Terrible"—Ivan the Terrible being the cruel Tsar of 16th-century Russia. Today, the voices of a dead Tsar and a living Führer can be heard together. The listeners of Hitler's speech are truly blessed.</p>
<p>The disruption suffered by German radio is not limited to this incident. Recently, German domestic news programs have often been interspersed with German from other sources, with the two sides responding to each other, much like a comedic duet. This has thoroughly undermined the news being propagated by the Germans. Some examples:</p>
<p>News report: The German army has won another great victory...</p>
<p>Interjection: A victory in the grave.</p>
<p>Report: Fifteen Soviet aircraft have been shot down...</p>
<p>Comment: What about German planes?</p>
<p>Report: German aircraft launched another large-scale attack last night...</p>
<p>Interjection: Did any return to their original base?</p>
<p>Report: British aircraft attempted an attack...</p>
<p>Interjection: How ridiculous.</p>
<p>Report: The Italian Air Force attacked a British warship...</p>
<p>Interjection: Don't make people laugh their stomachs out.</p>
<p>Report: The Führer's headquarters issued a communiqué stating...</p>
<p>Interjection: Besides lies, what else is there?</p>
<p>Report: News report complete.</p>
<p>Interjection: The lies will continue to be broadcast tomorrow.</p>
<p>Almost every sentence of German news reports was followed by an interjection. This made Goebbels both angry and amused, and the propaganda effect was completely lost. It was later discovered that these interjections came from the powerful Soviet radio station RWL—located in Noginsk, thirty miles from Moscow. As for who was singing the duet with the German news reports, some speculate it was the former Austrian journalist Fischer, while others say it was Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky, because Lozovsky not only mastered German but also enjoyed joking.</p>
<p>The Germans tried hard to eliminate these interjections, but to no avail. One tactic was to report the news very quickly, completing the entire report in one breath, leaving no room for interjections. While this prevented the duet, it turned the report into a tongue-twister. Could any listener understand what was being reported?</p>
<p>Essay Contest Announcement III</p>
<h3>Fulfilled Desire: A Lesson Learned</h3>
<p>— Sifeng Guo</p>
<p>It was a spring afternoon. I lay on the hammock on the porch, letting the warm sun cover my whole body. A white-eye bird was constantly chirping in the pomegranate tree. The gentle spring breeze lulled me to sleep. My elder brother and cousin's voices were constantly noisy in my ears. The sound was flat, intermittent, and seemed to have no end. My sleep was disturbed and I was very unhappy.</p>
<p>"I have" days I want to commit suicide, "my cousin suddenly said. I couldn't help but feel strange. My cousin was my grandfather's only grandson, and his life was the envy of all of us. Thinking of suicide," Yes, suicide, "he continued:" What is the meaning of my life? No competition, no desire, whatever I want, I get it... "He suddenly stopped, lowered his voice," except for the thrill, the stimulation of life. "After speaking, he grabbed his hat and left. I looked at my elder brother in surprise. He smiled bitterly and said solemnly to me," Fulfilling desires is troubling. "I wanted to taste the meaning of this sentence, but I fell asleep.</p>
<p>One evening, I was walking home from school, feeling very relaxed. I casually looked around. A very bright light stimulated my eyes. Looking in that direction, it was a jewelry store window. Inside were many ornaments. In the middle of many jade, agate, beads, and necklaces, I saw a small ivory ring, carved very exquisitely. On the ring face was carved a small toad, its mouth open as if it were yelling. It was very vivid. The eyes, mouth, tongue, and the patterns on its back were very clear. The surroundings of the ring were also carved with shy flowers, with stems and leaves. It was lined with a black velvet box, which made it look even cleaner and more lovely. I saw that the size was just right for my finger. I really wanted to buy it, but the price tag was much larger than all the pocket money I had. After looking at it for a while, I had to go back.</p>
<p>Back home, I told my mother and asked her to buy it for me, but I was rejected. My mother said I shouldn't spend money on these kinds of gadgets. I was very unhappy when I heard this, and my desire to own it increased. I had to get it. I thought I could save my bus fare and snack money to buy it.</p>
<p>From then on, every morning I got up very early to prepare to walk to school, and I often walked home in the afternoon. I endured being hungry and didn't buy snacks. My mother laughed at me and didn't allow me to do this, so I hid it from her. Although I felt miserable, I was very happy in my heart. When I walked past that window, I always glanced at the ring, thinking that I could wear it soon. Two weeks later, I took the money and walked to the entrance of that window. The ring was gone. The shop assistant told me that they had sold it two days earlier. My heart was like being poured cold water. I ran home in one breath. When my mother asked me, I almost cried.</p>
<p>A few days later, I went to my aunt's house with my mother to play. I unintentionally saw that my aunt was wearing that ring on her hand. Her fat hands, rosy nails, and the little white toad crawling on it? It was so cute." I couldn't help but exclaimed. My mother saw that I was acting dumbfounded and immediately understood everything. She laughed and told my aunt my story. My aunt laughed loudly when she heard it. "Okay, since you like it so much, I can give it to you. But there is one condition. You have to help me copy three Diamond Sutras for my use in July. Otherwise, I won't give it."</p>
<p>Copying the Diamond Sutra is the most boring thing. It is very difficult to write on rough yellow paper with that non-sticky cinnabar. Those sentences are often meaningless and repetitive. After writing three hundred characters, my wrist would ache, and my eyes would involuntarily close. But I finally patiently finished writing the three Diamond Sutras. Thinking of that ivory ring, it seemed like there was a force encouraging me.</p>
<p>On the morning of the seventh lunar month, I got the ring. I was very happy in my heart. I quickly put it on my finger and stared at it for a while. Suddenly I felt a little displeased. My fingers were very thick, and there were many veins and bones on my hands. My nails were bald. A pale hand with a white ring looked very rough and dull: I looked at the little toad again. It was lying there stupidly. I remembered the toad behind the water tank, and I felt it was ugly. I hurriedly took off the ring and threw it in the drawer. I regretted that I had spent so much effort on it.</p>
<p>I lay silently in bed, thinking of what my brother said: "Fulfilling desires is troubling." I thought I understood the meaning of this sentence now.</p>

<h3>Trackless Tank</h3>
<p>— Kezhong</p>
<p>Recently, the American military authorities have been working hard to manufacture and improve all military equipment. Among the new weapons recently tested is a type of trackless tank, in which all vehicle wheels are not connected by tracks, but can still move freely up and down according to the terrain, making it more flexible than old-fashioned tracked tanks. After the new trackless tank was test-driven by the U.S. Army, it was decided to be remodeled into a large tank and equipped with appropriate weapons. It is said that this new type of tank can be used for reconnaissance.</p>

<p>13. Drifting to Shanghai</p>
<p>"I'm not worried about those few dilapidated houses, I really don't know where I should flee. Because I have very little money left, and I can't possibly buy land to farm elsewhere, so I still haven't made up my mind to leave."</p>
<p>"Dad, that might not be a bad idea." Mei Bao, who had been listening to them for a long time, couldn't help but interject. "I'm not a child anymore, and I've studied for a few years. No matter where I go, I can always do something to help you old man live. Heaven probably won't starve us to death!"</p>
<p>"Third Master, really, not only has Miss Mei Bao studied for so many years, she can always earn a few dollars when she goes out, and even you old man, don't you still know how to sing opera? Even if you are old and can't sing yourself, can't you teach opera or play the erhu for people, and then you can eat?" Little Gouzi said very enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia shook his head.</p>
<p>"You don't know! There are wars everywhere now, who is in the mood to listen to opera?"</p>
<p>"No, Dad, there are exceptions! Bao昂 lifted his head, thought for a moment. "Last year I also heard a gentleman say that Shanghai is really a paradise. The French Concession and the Public Concession are dozens of times larger than the Tianjin Concession. There are large restaurants and theaters everywhere; even though there are wars outside, the people living inside don't have to worry at all. As long as you have money, anything can be done! If we just want to survive and don't ask anything else, Shanghai is a way out." (237)</p>

<h3>Autumn Season Strongmen of Various Storytelling Venues (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jian Fan</p>
<p>It is customary for storytelling venues to hire famous storytellers and adjust their lineups during the Lunar New Year and Mid-Autumn Festival. The New Year's opening is called "New Year's Season," which must be told until around the Dragon Boat Festival. Starting from the Mid-Autumn Festival, it is called "Autumn Season," which must be told until the end of the year. This period is the peak season for storytelling venues, and if the lineup is strong, business will surely flourish. Therefore, the various storytelling venues compete fiercely to recruit strongmen of the storytelling world, leaving no stone unturned. The auditorium of the Cangzhou Hotel has been opened as a storytelling venue, and with its complete facilities and comfortable seating, it is often full. Zhang Yuan Ji started later, and recently opened a new storytelling venue, which opened on Double Ten Day. In addition, there is also the Da Luotian on Simalu Road, which was once converted into a storytelling venue three years ago, but it was very short-lived. Recently, it has reopened as a night storytelling venue. The Xu Hua's storytelling of the Guangrun two societies has added territory, and there is a great revival. However, Xia Hesheng and Zhang Hongsheng went to Su to perform half a month ago; Jiang Ruting and Zhu Jiesheng are still exclusively affiliated with radio broadcasts. The female storytellers of the Puyu Society, only Zai Meiyun, who is re-affiliated to the Nanjing storytelling venue, is most excited by the listeners. The following is a brief description of the strongmen of storytelling in the autumn lineup of each storytelling venue who have appeal:</p>
<p>Huang Yian is good at telling the story of West Chamber Record, which was formerly pushed by Zhu Lan'an, whose clear words were like jade, and still popular. He adapted the script of West Chamber, removing the dross and retaining the essence. The rhetoric is gorgeous, and the elegant rhyme is about to flow! He was hired by storytelling venues in other places, and he was heard everywhere. He returned to Shanghai last month. He is affiliated with Huyuanyuan and Longquanlou during the day, and Nanyuan, Yalu, and Baihuating at night. Except for Nanyuan's unique single block, the other four storytelling venues are combined with his disciple Qian Yanqiu's double block. The art of storytelling is good, and it never fails to be fascinating. Listeners praise it, only one person after Zhu Lan'an!</p>
<p>Shen Jian'an, the Zhu Ta's loud teller, Shen Jian'an, after breaking up with Xue Xiaoqing, took his proud disciple Li Nian'an to Changshu, Wuxi and other places to sing. This time he came back to Shanghai, affiliated to Zhang Yuan, Huyuanyuan, Nanyuan, Baihuating, and Fuchunlou during the day. Jian'an's storytelling is concise and relaxed, and he sings overlapping sentences in the Ma tune. His voice is louder than before, and the rhyme is profound! The future is indeed immeasurable.</p>
<p>Wang Shouzhang, who is good at telling the Record of Good and Evil Retribution, is Wang Shouqing's younger brother and the son of Wang Shiquan, one of the four famous families. The storytelling is meticulous. He is meticulous in every detail. He is allowed to "tang face book" and is best at winning the competition. He is now affiliated with the Huiquanlou daily head block, speaking for an hour, a master of planing wheels, extraordinary, but unfortunately not noticed by those who are new to storytelling.</p>
<p>"Singer Red Peony" was a masterpiece of Butterfly Hu, who was very popular at the time. Now, at her own suggestion, it is being re-shot as a sound film, directed by Wang Cilong, and starring Wang Wenlong, Wu Chufan, Wang Naidong, and others. Starting tomorrow, it will be screened at the Great Shanghai Theater after "New Sisters".</p>
<h3>A Quick Sketch of Chen Yunshang Going to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Ciping</p>
<p>Miss Chen Yunshang, a Chinese film star, after completing the giant films "Home" and "New Sisters" in the National League, originally planned to shoot another film adapted from a mixed-race daughter, "Private Love", but due to the repeated calls from the Hong Kong Daguan Company, she could no longer delay, so Miss Yunshang asked for a two-month vacation to go to Hong Kong to fulfill her previous filming contract, which was still two years ago. Miss Chen signed a contract with them to shoot a play, the title of which is a fashion film "Female　Binhan"</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at two o'clock, the Jianghaiguan Wharf on Guanglu Road, Sanmalu Bund was crowded with people. The senders seemed to be more lively than usual. It turned out that most of them were unfamiliar senders. Young men and women were all expecting the same thing.</p>

<h3>Blood Stained Garden</h3>
<p>— Gu Lidao</p>
<p>Chapter 18　Swearing to Sweep Away the Xiongnu Regardless of One's Own Body</p>
<p>Li Zicheng said: "Hmph! Don't blame you, who should I blame?" Wu Xiang said: "Your lowly subject dares not say." Li Zicheng said: "Strange, strange! Why don't you dare to say it? Just say it." Wu Xiang said: "Your lowly subject understands that my son loves his favorite concubine Yuanyuan the most in his life. The other day, he left Beijing in a hurry and didn't bring her with him. Now that Yuanyuan belongs to our King, it's like taking away the flesh of his heart, so he wants to change his mind." Li Zicheng sneered and said: "So this is all my fault." Wu Xiang said: "Your lowly subject dares not blame Your Majesty; but your lowly subject presumptuously has" a request. If Your Majesty can allow it, your lowly subject will be fortunate, and my son will be fortunate." Li Zicheng said: "Tell me about it." Wu Xiang said: "If Your Majesty wants to win the world, you must treat the generals with special kindness. If Your Majesty is willing to grant Yuanyuan to my son, then as long as your lowly subject sends another letter, my son will surely come back obediently and serve Your Majesty's command. Li Zicheng heard Wu Xiang's words and shouted, "Bah!" A mouthful of saliva spat directly on Wu Xiang's face. At this time, Wu Xiang was so frightened that he didn't dare to reach out to wipe it, showing the style of waiting for the saliva to dry on his face, trembling endlessly. Li Zicheng said loudly again: "Chen Yuanyuan is a peerless beauty, and now she belongs to me. In the future, I will wait for the day when I claim the title of emperor to be crowned as queen. How can your son have this blessing, dreaming of getting her as a wife! He can't get close to her in his whole life. You old thief! Don't use flowery words in front of me, cut him down." Just as he was about to order his men to push him out, Wu Xiang repeatedly kowtowed and begged for mercy. Just then, the rebel general Li Yan came to see him. Li Yan saw Wu Xiang's state of wagging his tail and begging for mercy, so he interceded for him and said: "Now Your Majesty should temporarily spare his life, and then punish him together when you capture San Gui in the future." Li Zicheng said: "Alright," so he ordered his men to detain Wu Xiang strictly and not let him go. So the men pulled Wu Xiang away.</p>
