<p>合眾社二十二日華盛頓電　政府領袖包括羅斯福總統在內、昨對目前美·日談判繼續表示沉默、詢及與來栖之談判是否有樂觀之理由時、羅斯福總統拒絕作直接答覆、僅以幽默之語調答稱、此種問話、猶如詢問「汝擊汝妻否」？</p>

<h3 id="c25">從被動到主動 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>蘇德間的苦戰，業於隆冬屆臨之際進入了第六個月，連日德軍又結集援軍向莫斯科發動最後的猛烈攻勢，克里米亞半島方面自柯趣不幸失陷而後，德軍距離其最大目標的高加索亦僅一衣帶水之隔，不過另一方面，卽使姑置德軍損失與悄耗於不問，僅就其進展速度而論，亦可見其漸成弩末，無復在西綫和巴爾幹作戰時的鋒芒。納粹的戰爭機構還能繼續幾時以至尙能提供幾許增援實力，無人能予確言，但無論如何，其實力總是消耗一分便减少一分，無法從世界其他部分獲得增援或補充，歐陸雖大，其人力與物資到底不是取之無盡用之不竭的。邇來德方和平攻勢不斷見之傳聞，最近又復脅迫維希，重彈德法合作舊調，這可以算做是希特勒目光四射的特長，同時也未始不是因對蘇戰事持久不決且節候復値冬寒而準備別闢發展蹊徑。過勞的人總不免早衰，成吉思汗的龐大帝國也只能有不到百年的命運，把騎射時代的往例應用到機械化與閃電戰的現代，則不妨斷言：納粹侵略者極盛的黃金時代已經漸成過去了。</p>
<p>如果從蘇德戰事進而檢討整個民治陣綫對侵略勢力的消長，則從任何一個短的時間片段來看，也許會覺得事實的進展太迂緩遲滯，不能使人滿意，但是其整個過程却是一個可驚的進步，而且正向着由量到質的變化飛躍。已往慕尼黑的時代不必講了，卽在一年以前，也還是侵略國家佔有莫能予毒的優勢，各民治列强，不是僅求自保，就是有意無意的繼續着某種綏靖企圖，聯合反侵略的意識和要求是各處都存在着的，却始終未能具體化或蔚為巨流。到去冬德國對英空襲不逞，美國大選也吿一段落，其時東西暴力因感到自身處境之孤立，乃相互結託以冀增厚實力並嚇退協約國的與國，結果到反而促成各民治國的一致堅決應付：英國放棄了對遠東綏靖政策的最後殘餘，美國則於表示堅定態度之餘，更復貸款中國，通過租軍法案，積極從事援華援英程序，並在大西洋上與英共同負起剷除剽襲的任務，國際大局纔透露了新的曙光。及至蘇德戰事爆發，一方久勞想像的中美英蘇共抗侵略之舉漸形具體化，另方侵略者自己另行開闢了悄耗自身實力的戰塲，英國於略獲喘息之餘，乃得加緊配備，增進生產，作反攻的準備，除在北海及大西洋嚴予戒備之外，更在中東肅淸了肘腋之患，在遠東參加了ABCD的聯防。而美國中立法案根本修正之後，武裝商船已得直駛戰區，共對英美戰具的供給大形便捷，間接也就是迅速增强了反侵略作戰的實力。而侵略者的處境，則納粹已在蘇境陷入泥淖，ABCD陣綫也在南太平洋佈就了應變的羅網，卽使有若干醞釀尙未完全成熟，整個的世運確已臨到一個新的變化契機，具體來說，也就是當前的問題已經不僅是如何抵禦侵略者的攻勢，而是如何去撲滅摧毀侵略罪惡的根株。</p>
<p>這一情勢，以近頃英國所表現者最形露骨，反攻歐陸的計畫，據英相邱吉爾日前在英議會的報吿，目前尙未到行動的時機，但在中東和遠東，則都已堅決採取了主動姿態。在表示了準備與美國在遠東駢肩作戰之後，其遠東各屬領的防務均在迅速增强之中，日來已有加拿大軍增防香港與大批澳洲軍隊的到達新加坡，據英海相亞歷山大的表示，更證實了英艦隊亦由歐東駛，增强其遠東艦隊的實力。自本月十八日起，北非英軍突對義屬利比亞採取猛烈攻勢，一週以來，已突入義境百餘英哩，橫越英孤軍久守的杜白魯克而西，在形式上這雖然似乎是去年十月華維爾爵士所指揮攻勢的重演，但適當蘇方呼籲速闢第二戰塲而德方則大軍方膠着於蘇境陣地並對法屬北非殖民地加緊覬覦之際，此舉的重大意義絕不僅是掃除義大利帝國在非洲的最後殘壘並與若干機械化的德軍一決雌雄而已。</p>
<p>但是另一方面，現在華盛頓方面還正進行着美日間覓取和平解決的談話，從表面看來，似乎是在英美之間存在着緩急之分，因而難免有人對美國政策態度有所誤解。但是英國此際是一個幾乎無戰可交的交戰國，只要實力有把握，隨時隨地都可以發動攻勢；至於美國，則至今仍只站在戰爭的邊緣，其一切進退當亦僅有就其非交戰國的立場去考慮。英國可以立卽發動進攻利比亞的戰爭，美國如準傭佔領達加爾則不能不先打破參戰的藩籬，雖然在必要時那也許是輕而易舉的事。不過兩國間在措施上縱有差別，其立塲則絕無殊異，羅邱宣言及美當局歷次所堅決表示者都足資保證華府談話只是試騐用和平手段遏阻侵略是否還能有效，時至今日，任何國家都不容重蹈綏靖攻策覆轍的。更何况在談話而外，美國也完成了必要的最後準備，六艘三萬五千噸主力艦之業有五艘在本年之內完成，這不是一件可以等閒視之的事。倘若談話無成，「和平」絕望，則美國更進一步的態度相信也必然和英國同樣是從被動到主動的飛躍。</p>

<p>據工部局情報處發表、第二批最高零售物價表、業經本局核准公布、定自本月二十四日起實施、表內所列應受物價統制之各項物品、名目繁多、大半為藥品與食物、因譯述需時、故華文報紙不及同時刊佈，各零售商店經售表列物品者、自上開之日期起、務須依照限價發售、不得超過、又第一批限價表內所列若干種物品之價目、刻已變更、並經註明第二批價目表內、</p>
<p>多購限價物品之弊</p>
<p>査自第一批限價表刊布以後、發現市民與零售商有多購多定表列物品之趨勢、此種舉動、足以破壞以合理售價保持供給不斷之原來計劃、嗣後切盼為公衆利益着想、盡量限制購買、務以應付最低需要為度、（第一批限價表英文本、現已印就、每本售洋五角、可　該局捐稅股購買）、</p>
<p>此次限價分兩大類</p>
<p>工部局昨發表第二號零售物價統制單、內列天祥洋行等十餘家商行所經理與製造之貨品多種、分為伙食與藥品兩大類、從十一月二十四日起、公共租界內零售此等貨品、不得超過限價、</p>
<p>零售店竟拒售火油</p>
<p>兩租界當局、自管理物價以來、各種日用品、一致回跌、最近經公布限價後、物價上漲之風已戢、惟一般烟兌雜貨零售店、對火油零售顧客、遽而拒絕售與、核其實情、非無存貨、此種阻撓現象、亟待當局制裁、</p>
<p>豆腐亦將評定售價</p>
<p>豆腐業昨日向工部局陳請兩點、　請轉令豆業、將豆價抑低為每百市斤穴十元（按現為一百十元）、則該業不獨維持營業、且自願將豆腐售價抑低、以輕平民負担、如不獲减低豆價、該業祇可加價、　酌量增加豆腐售價辦法、上項請求、已於昨日遞呈租界當局、租界當局、以豆腐為日用必需品、非但不能抬價、以重市民負担、且須評定售價、以利公衆、</p>
<p>滬西售米辦法決定</p>
<p>工部局物價統制辦事處發言人昨答米荒之問話稱、該局以洋米供給滬西零售店之布置、現已竣事、米糧之分發等手續、頗費時間、惟現已籌備、不久即可派米予西區各米店零售、其辦法與公共租界現所施行者相同云、該發言人復反駁公共租界若干米店因利益菲薄而拒售工部局洋米之說、據謂、局方現以充分洋米供給核准之零售米店、以應公衆需求、</p>
<p>運米恢復許可證制</p>
<p>工部局頃發佈告略稱、自本月二十四日起、簽發搬運各種米糧之許可證、每包一律收費二角、第一期米糧集體買賣、所餘八千三百二十包之出貨辦法、亦經商決、由糧食管理委員會於前日發給出米搬運證、交由米號業公會、於昨晨分發各米號、已登記之缺米各米號、昨日起開始向山海關路米號業公會領取搬運證者、達一百三十二家、付款後即可領取憑單、迅即出貨、以供門市需求、各米號獲得米糧後、不論其米糧之品質如何、一概不准攙雜、須照來貨出售與巿民、代辦工部局洋米之立基洋行、現每日仍核准缺米米號添購工部局洋米、總數每日約計五千餘包左右、故本市目前民食之供給情形、甚屬正常、</p>

<p>— 傑克</p>
<p>溯自資金凍結，平準基金會利用時機，控制匯市後，上海外匯問題，似乎不復存在。良以平準基金旣將外匯集中特許銀行之手，禁止直接或間接按其他匯率從事賣買，以圖消滅黑市；復直接限制洋貨進口，間接限制外匯供給，减少進口數量，以求調整貿易。雖然，黑市買賣，不絕如縷，出口匯票，未能徵集，聯繫交易，無法禁止，凡此三端，母庸諱言。即如管理貿易，供匯標準之甲乙淸單，亦有瑕疵。故筆者初嘗建議：與英美合作成立領照制度，規定非將所得匯票售與特許銀行，不許進口，以集中出口匯票，增加基金；而甲乙淸單，應重加釐訂。其後鑒於黑匯狂縮，復力主與英美成立嚴格之淸算協定以澈底統制外匯，供匯之標準，以維持民生為首要，民族工業次之，其他則視事實之情勢而定供給之比重，以嚴格管理貿易。蓋今日上海外匯問題，眞正的解決，要在出口匯票，如何微集，聯繫交易，如何禁止，則黑市交易，不禁自絕，進口貿易，如何管理，供匯標準，如何刪訂，則法幣價値，不鞏自固</p>
<p>乃者，中英美三國之經濟使節在香港集　而得之結果，業由英美政府本月十二日同時宜佈修訂對華資金封存法令。新辦法之具體內容，自近日電訊所傳而觀，確為一種嚴格的外匯統制與貿易管理之計劃。以美國言之，在新辦法之下：　修訂一九四一年七月二十五日之封存資金法令，所有中美貿易，須經中國平準基金會之管制：進口方面，在貨物輸出以前，美海關當局，務須査閱證明文件，是否一一依照中國平準基金會所訂各種條件辦理；出口方面，在貨物運出以前，美領事必須事先由特許銀行通知出口外匯業經售結後，始可發給領事簽證書。　關於匯華款項，頒發新執照，除東三省外，任何數目之匯款——中國封存帳戶及非封存帳戶所存之美元，均可一律指匯至中國各地，惟由此項滙款而得之美元，須歸平準基金會統制，隨時撥用。以英國——英帝國之其他部份在內——言之，無論由華輸入及對華輸出，皆須依照平準基金所定匯價，經由特許銀行辦理之條件下，方能付款。至於特許之銀行：　為中國政府銀行之中·中·交·農四行，　為洋商銀行之美國運通·大通·花旗·友邦·莫斯科國民·華比·通濟隆·匯豐·有利·麥加利·老沙遜洋行·新沙遜洋行·荷闌安達·和蘭等十四家，　為中國商業銀行之廣東·中興·東亞·華僑·浙江實業·浙江興業·金城·上海等八家。</p>
<p>細按此項辦法，察其功能，實與淸算協定無異。蓋凡自中國出口之貨物，無論其輸出口岸及輸出商國籍，必須將外滙售結與特許銀行，而華僑匯款等亦須經由特許銀行，方能付款如此中國之國際收入，無論貿易的或金融的均歸入基金帳內。不能流入黑巿，黑市旣無供給，黑市交易，不禁自絕。外滙供給旣歸人基金，則基金可隨時增加，進口外滙之支撥，不必全賴原有基金。基金旣隨時增加，則供給進口外滙之時，可參照頭襯多少，而定滙額之　歉。於是中國統制外匯，乃得澈慶解決之方法。總之，平準基金此次職能之擴充，全為英美政府善意之合作，急盼該會積極擬定步驟推進此項職能，以最簡便之手續及最大之努力，完成中美英三國合作之目標焉。</p>

<p>— 殷</p>
<p>小朋友們；假使不是健忘的話，那末開學時的快樂的情形，一定能够記得、像父母把血汗的錢，代你們付了學費，使得你們　新獲得了許多精神的食糧，——新書——。但是光陰是最無情的，梧桐樹的落葉，吿訴你們初冬巳經　臨，而學期的結束，亦在不遠的將來。</p>
<p>勤學的同學，固然很多，可是一定有少數的同學，或者為了功課的艱難，抱定「橫豎橫」的宗旨；或者為了日久生厭，對於數旬前的新書，感不起興趣；或者推託學期的結束，還有一二個月，暫且白相白相罷；於是成績一天一天地退步，而且越是退步，越是不再用心，結果，學期結束的來臨，祇有實行「開夜車」，甚而至於不能及格而留級，而遭親友的譏笑。</p>
<p>這是多麼可恥，多麽耗廢父母辛勤所得之金錢的一件事呀！但是，「過不憚改」，「勤以補拙」，趕快從今日起，而且必須決定，從不成明日的今日，檢點一下過去的成績，是否在水準之下。若以前所敎過的功課，都好像「面熟陌生」，那末規定在溫習本日所敎功課的餘暇，提出一些時間，補溫一二課舊功課，必須有疑即請敎老師，或者優秀的同學，那末尙能挽回以前的過失，雖不能立刻變成最優，但及格是不成問題的。</p>
<p>小朋友們！請特別地注意着時間的警告：——梧桐落葉，初冬巳到人間了！</p>
<h3 id="c70">一個小鐵匠 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>俗語說：「好男不當兵，好鐵不打釘」，視好男當兵為可恥，視好鐵打釘為可惜；可是在這大時代，這兩句話，就不對了。「好男要當兵」，國家纔有生路；「好鐵要打釘」，建築纔能根深蒂固。現在來讓筆者寫一個小鐵匠的故事，獻給小朋友們。</p>
<p>小鐵匠金兒，原來是一個農家子弟，十一歲那年，不幸遭着「八一三」砲火之刦，拋棄了書本，泣別了故鄕，跟着他的媽和哥哥，狼狽的逃亡到上海來。途中冒着彈雨橫飛，歷盡了千辛萬苦，　　不幸的是他的哥哥，中途飲流彈而死了。這時生命間不容髮，他也顧不得哥哥的屍首，而廻護着壯健的母親，鼓着勇氣，終於給他母子倆達到了上海。可是舉目無親，有誰來給他母子以衣食住呢？他的媽媽，便想出一條生路，去坐薦頭店，沒有幾天，給一家　鐵匠店的老闆雇去做女傭了。當然，他也跟了去，經他媽媽的懇求，收為徒弟，實做了一個「小鐵匠」。他在三年鍛鍊之下的堅强個性，是能够忍飢耐寒堅苦奮鬥，一天到晚，叮噹叮的工作。這位小鐵匠的志向不小，要求他師父設法薦他到大後方去工作，結果，被他達到目的；他今年　十五歲呢。小朋友讀後作何觀感？</p>
<h3 id="c71">撲滅肺癆運動 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 鈕惠人</p>
<p>在現今科學發達的時候，可還沒有一個醫治癆病的可靠方法；一染上了這個病，便得整年療養，消磨了做人的志氣，更有大部的人，遭到喪生的危險。這眞是一種怕人的病！在上海四百萬人口中，據估計，至少有三十三萬人正在它的侵襲中。小朋友，快起來參加滅肺癆運動——來撲滅這個無形的大敵。</p>
<p>我們怎樣來參加這個運動呢？第一，我們該注意自身的健康。多運動，多注意淸潔衛生，每學期詳細檢査體格一次，避免和預防它來侵襲。要是不幸已受到它的侵入，便該早日就醫診治，倘時間上一躭誤，成了大病，那就很危險了。</p>
<p>第二，要向社會宣傳。肺癆是一種社會病，社會上有了它的發現，便是整個社會的不幸。撲滅了這個社會的大敵，也就是保衛自己的家庭。可見這個運動，必須發動整個社會的力量。所以我們要盡力向旁人宣傳，把肺癆撲滅運動的重耍，深深地印入每個人的腦中</p>
<p>第三，贊助上海防癆協會的募捐運動，他們募捐的目的是建築一個大規模的肺癆醫院，來　淸上海的肺癆；並且募捐的費用都是工作人員擔任，不費捐款分文，這種純潔的慈善精神，是使人欽佩，所以我們必須熱烈的加以贊助！</p>
<p>快些，我們快來參加道個撲滅肺癆運動。</p>

<p>黃葉在地上悉悉索索，</p>

<p>難道在埋怨西風嗎？</p>
<p>還是在作最後的掙扎？</p>
<p>只怪它們自己：</p>

<p>— 一志</p>
<p>早上空氣清新，環境恬靜，所以早晨起來做運動，可以强壯筋骨，溫習功課，也容易記牢，這些話，小朋友們大約早已聽見帥長講過，並且一定也敎你們要早起，是不是？</p>
<p>一般愛好的小朋友，他們當然照着師長的話實行，養成了早起的習慣，而一般性情懶惰的小朋友，一到冷天，仍舊躱在被窩里不肯早起，這就是沒有決心。</p>
<p>我們無論做什麼事，必須要有堅强的意志，沉着的決心，及持久的精神，才能達到成功，實行早起，也是如此，要毅然決然，才能養成習慣。</p>
<p>早起對於小朋友有很多的益處，從今天起，本來早起的，要格外有恒心，天天早起，常常晏起的，應當下一個决心，也天天早起，起來做一個小戰士，與寒風搏擊，不再躱在被窩裏做懶惰蟲。</p>
<p>小朋友是國家的的主人翁，應當從小就有養成良好習慣的決心與精神，將來才能擔負重大的責任。</p>

<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>秋深了，天氣漸漸的冷了，小朋友，你們穿的衣服，不是也加厚了嗎？我家鄰居的一個小朋友，昨天傍晚，穿了絨綫編結的衣服，在街口玩要時，忽然來了一個陌生的人，對他說，「小弟弟，那邊買糖吃去嗎？」他說「不去，媽要找的」，「那麼你將你的絨綫衫脫給我吧！」那陌生的人說着，就來脫他的衣服，那小朋友心中很害怕，於是哭起來了。那人見他哭了，就從袋內摸出一把明晃晃的小刀來，喝着說，「不許哭，再哭就割你的手指，」那小朋友就不敢再哭，眼看着自己的衣服，被別人搶去。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們很多人不是也穿絨錢衣服的嗎？你們聽到了這消息以後，心中又覺得怎樣呢！希望你們從此以後，好好的在家裏用功讀書，不再在外面遊蕩，那麽就不至於遭到和上面那個小朋友同樣的命運。</p>

<p>— 林仁</p>
<p>他母親更整理到了阿亮去年做的那一件罩衫，因為多洗多晒的關係，竟變了帶白的顏色，怪難看的。他父親立在旁也在看着，心想阿亮一定又要發問的，便先對着他說：「你看，你的那件套衫什麽變了顏色了？」</p>
<p>「這是多洗多晒的關係呢？」阿亮笑嘻嘻的說，表示他的聰明。</p>
<p>「為什麽衣服多洗多晒，會變顏色的呢？」他父親接口的問着，頓時害得阿亮收起笑容而口呆目瞪的回答不出了。</p>
<p>「好，我來吿訴你？衣服是有各式各樣的顏色，都是用各種顏色的染料染成的，要知道染料是一種很複雜的化學品，當許多染料多晒太陽光之後，便會變成別種化合物，要是本來的顏色是靑的，若變了新成的化合物的顏色便會不同起來，或要成白的，和其他的色彩，所以凡是染過色的衣服，不好多晒啊！還有洗衣服，用熱水來洗比冷水洗的來得乾淨？因為衣服上的齦齪，大都不是油漬，便是灰塵，緊緊的粘在衣服上面，經熱水一洗，能够把油脂等汚物加以軟化，不致於再粘在衣服上，這樣便可洗得淸了？而冷水便沒有這種本領。你若不相信，可以去問問媽媽，我說得　不對？」阿亮的父親又不耐煩的說了這一大套話。阿亮當然相信他父親說的話，况且要是爸爸說錯了，媽媽也是幫他的啊？這是阿亮心中的默語，可不敢說出口來。不過爸爸所講的話，大部分是對的呀！</p>

<h3 id="c76">表演上海的新話劇 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>投機囤積者與　其失敗絕望到自殺　何如轉變目標作有利國家的大業</p>
<p>「內地的兵士流着血汗，忍着飢餓在前綫打仗：內地的民衆流離失所；可是上海的民衆還是窮奢極慾，荒淫無度」，有的囤積貨物，有的投機交易，有的金迷紙醉。表現這種糜爛的生活的話劇很多，例如徐渠的「生意經」，包蕾的「淘金記」，夏衍的「愁城肥」都是。但結果都寫投機囤積者失敗到自殺，至少也是絕望。這三位作者的態度是一樣的，刻畫，諷刺甚至指責。本來，這種人也只好如此看法。</p>
<p>但新近在璇宮上演的顧仲彝的「孤島男女」却與上述的三個劇本不同。作者是懷着滿腔的熱望和憐憫的。作者抱着敎育家的態度，覺得一個人做壞事，並不一定都出於自願，而有外誘，如結交壞人等。我國許多私人經營的事業亦即國力：倘能要這些人轉而做有利國家的事業，例如投資內地開礦等，也未始不是好事。因此，作者不叫主人公張鏡山因失敗而自殺，雖然不曾繼續演下去，但從鏡山投機失敗後，嚴厲管敎子女，不許他們跳舞賭錢看來，他自己也會澈悟，而與他那有為的弟弟鎭山到內地去的。</p>
<p>在第二幕，作者巳經表明鏡山對於投機所感到的痛苦：「做這種生意心裹老是像壓着一塊石頭，日夜心裏不安。在日裹呢，只想打個電話問問市塲消息，晚上連覺也睡不着，這種精神上痛苦的生意，我覺得太沒有意思了」。第三幕鏡山又說：「這種投機生意，我根本不想了，我覺得厭倦極了，成天到晚在緊張的情緖之下過生活；市價的上落在做投機事業的心上就像有冷水在那裏澆，有時又像有火在那裹燒，你心裏　會兒大熱，一會兒大冷，不是堅强的人，誰也熬不過這種殺人不見血的折磨」。</p>
<p>這兩段話一方面顯出鏡山會有轉變，一方面也是作者的苦心，深切地說出投機的痛苦，警惕別人不要再做。投機囤積者是否全都會有覺悟，是另一問題，但我們不能沒有這個希望。</p>
<p>所以，這種題材雖已有好幾個作家寫過，「孤島男女」卻仍是値得一看的從未有人着想過的新的境界。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sixth Session of the National Political Council Passes Measures to Reorganize Conscription and Military Training; Resolutions Also Made on Improving Overseas Chinese Education; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Hosts Banquet for All Councilors in the Evening <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – On the morning of the 22nd, the various groups of the National Political Council continued to review proposals. At 3:00 PM, the sixth general session was held. The presidium members Zhang Boling, Zuo Shunsheng, Zhang Junmai, Yao Yifang, and councilors such as Lu Qian, totaling 168 people, attended. Secretary-General Wang Shijie and Deputy Secretary-General Zhou Binglin were present, as well as the heads of various ministries and commissions, including He Yingqin, Weng Wenhao, Zhou Zhongyue, Chen Lifu, Guo Taiqi, Xu Kan, Gu Zhenggang, and Jiang Tingfu, totaling over 40 people. Zuo Shunsheng, the chairman, presided over the meeting. First, the presidium reported that when councilors cannot personally attend the general session but entrust the secretariat to seek co-signers for their proposals and submit them to the session, the secretariat, unless the presidium has a special decision, may consider the situation, state the facts, and send the proposal to the government's responsible agency for consideration. Subsequently, Minister He Yingqin and Minister Guo Taiqi respectively responded to the inquiries made by the councilors in the previous session regarding military and diplomatic affairs, which took about an hour. Then, the discussion of proposals began, totaling 22 cases passed. All councilors carefully discussed and considered the review reports submitted by the review committee, paying particular attention to the implementation methods of each case. As a result, the explanations and debates were more intense, and the resolutions made emphasized practicality. There were fewer cases sent to the government for reference compared to previous sessions. This is because each case underwent careful review and detailed research in the review committee. Those that were impractical and difficult to implement were reserved. The emphasis on practicality of this session is evident. The following is a summary of the cases passed by the general session: The proposal by Councilor Zhang Zhijiang and others to reorganize conscription and military training methods to strengthen the foundation of national defense was resolved to be passed with amendments. The proposal by Councilor Zhu Zihong and others to request the government to transfer the unpaid conscription quota of Sichuan Province for the 30th year to the next year for monthly supplementary conscription, in order to strengthen the forces against Japan and to avoid significant impact on grain administration, was resolved that since this case concerns military service and the requested extension for the unmet quota, and the monthly补足 is not a change to the plan, it should be handled by the responsible ministry in consultation with the local government. The proposal by Councilor Zhang Zhijiang and others to change the passive care for soldiers injured and disabled in the war against Japan to active care, and to provide large-scale technical training for second- and third-class lightly wounded soldiers so that they can support themselves independently and avoid an unlimited burden on the country, was resolved to be passed with amendments. The proposal by Councilor Tan Zan and others to request the government to negotiate with the United States to improve the treatment of overseas Chinese to demonstrate the government's goodwill and benefit overseas Chinese affairs was resolved to be passed in its original form and sent to the government for practical handling. The proposal by Councilor Zhang Jiuru and others to request the prompt abolition of overlapping and opportunistic organizations and the reduction of non-urgent government orders to save manpower, financial resources, and materials to meet the needs of national defense and increase administrative efficiency was resolved to be passed with amendments and sent to the government for prompt and practical planning and implementation.

<p>Hong Kong – It is rumored that because the Japanese army is gathering in the Tonkin area of Vietnam, General Bai Chongxi, Deputy Chief of Staff of China, has arrived in Nanning to inspect the border defenses. It is said that Bai will also inspect the Longzhou defenses. Bai's trip is due to fears that the Japanese army will attack Yunnan from Guangxi. Transportation on the border between Guangxi and Yunnan is indeed not easy, but the mountainous roads from Vietnam to Yunnan are even more rugged and the terrain is more dangerous. Longzhou and Zhennanguan have a railway to Hanoi, making them vulnerable to Japanese attacks. Elite Chinese troops, including excellent troops from Guangdong, have been stationed at key points in southern Guangxi to prepare for defense. The strength of the Japanese army in Vietnam is uncertain due to conflicting information. Foreign sources say that there are less than 30,000 Japanese troops in northern Vietnam. Chongqing reports that the Japanese strength is between 100,000 and 120,000, with the former seeming more accurate because it is not easy for Japan to transfer a large army to the south. However, another Chinese source said that since October 26, the Japanese army in Taiwan has been continuously transferred to Haiphong. Last week, someone saw sixteen Japanese troop transport ships sailing towards Haiphong south of Hainan Island. The Japanese army in Xiamen and Shantou is recruiting 6,000 laborers to transport troops in Vietnam. Chinese sources here have found that the Japanese army needs at least 150,000 troops to attack Yunnan. Since November 1, Chinese mechanized units have been concentrating on the Yunnan border, including elite infantry and a strong air force. Most of the aircraft are Curtiss P-40 fighter planes with a speed of 380 miles per hour, and their combat effectiveness is far superior to Japanese fighter planes.

(21st dispatch) place, there would be less risk of provoking such strong resistance to curb its adventurous ambitions, then what attitude would the British government take? The Prime Minister did not clarify this point, so Japan will closely watch Churchill's words to the United States for any guarantee to China, which is a real danger. Japan's aggression will take the strategy that suits it best, and the most tempting thing to do is to attack the Chinese side of the Yunnan-Burma Road. A Japanese victory in that area would destroy China's lifeline and open up hopes of reaching Burma and India. It has recently been reported that the Japanese army has gathered in large numbers near the Sino-Vietnamese border, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has also made a meaningful appeal. If Japan decides to make its safest bet in that area, the democratic nations should provide China with military assistance. This is ample proof that the danger is real and urgent. For this reason, both for ourselves and for China, we cannot help but hope that Churchill will expand his warning to Japan to include the latter event. If the Japanese army attacks along the Yunnan-Burma Road, Britain will declare war on Japan within an hour, just as it would in the Pacific. (22nd United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington, 22nd (Reuters) – President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that there had been no new developments in the U.S.-Japan talks.</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd (United Press) – Government leaders, including President Roosevelt, remained silent yesterday about the ongoing U.S.-Japan negotiations. When asked if there was reason for optimism about the negotiations with Kurusu, President Roosevelt declined to answer directly, responding humorously that the question was like asking "Do you beat your wife?"</p>
<p>Washington, 21st – The first week of the Hull-Kurusu talks ended today. The talks are still in the exploratory stage and have not reached any plans or agreements on any point. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull remain committed to the basic national policy of the United States, and there is no sign of a minimum compromise on the U.S. plan to aid China's resistance to aggression. Sources said that the Pacific is still full of unease and the sentiment that war could break out at any time. Both U.S. and Japanese officials are still remaining silent, and the content of the talks and the instructions from the Tokyo government to Kurusu have remained confidential. There is much speculation about the outline that Hull presented to Kurusu, and there is still no confirmation of the rumor that the Secretary of State made the following four points to the Japanese ambassador: 1. Japan withdraws from the Axis; 2. Japan declares that it will not commit further aggression against the South Pacific and Siberia; 3. Japan withdraws from China and Vietnam; 4. Business opportunities in the Pacific region should be equal. The Chicago Daily Tribune said that if the United States insists on the above four points, Japan cannot expect any fundamental changes. If Japan only expresses partial approval of Hull's plan, the U.S. government will be difficult to satisfy. The U.S. government is also not interested in establishing limited regulations. The New York Times said that Roosevelt and Hull are not even prepared to use the conditions announced by Tojo in the Japanese Parliament as the basis for bilateral talks and will never compromise with Japan's acts of intimidation under any circumstances. It is said that Japan will make some concessions, but at present, it will try its best to slow down the U.S. economic pressure on Japan.</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd (United Press) – U.S. and Japanese officials took a short break from negotiations yesterday, apparently to carefully consider the demands made by both sides and make a final effort to reach a mutual conclusion on the Far East issue. This period of rest is the first recess after the "peace or war" talks began on Monday. Although some reports claim that if the United States can relax economic pressure on Japan, Japan may agree to make concessions to the United States, the United States has not indicated that it accepts this as a condition for reconciliation. Observers believe that the point is still under discussion. Washington continues to spread the word that Secretary of State Hull will propose a four-point program: 1. Japan withdraws from the Axis or agrees not to join the Axis war; 2. Japan ceases further aggressive actions in the South Pacific or Siberia; 3. Japan withdraws its troops from China and Vietnam; 4. Japan is guaranteed equal economic opportunities in the Pacific region. The New York Herald Tribune said that if the United States insists on the above four points, Japan cannot expect Washington to make any fundamental concessions. The newspaper said that even if Japan agrees to accept a portion of the points, Washington will still not be satisfied, and the U.S. government is not interested in limited consent. The New York Times said that President Roosevelt and Hull are determined not to accept the outline listed by Tojo in his speech in Parliament, even as the basis for negotiations, because the United States will not yield to Japan's aggression under any conditions.</p>
<p>London, 22nd (Reuters) – The talks between U.S. officials and Japanese representatives in Washington ended last night, and there is no sign of when they will resume. General opinion is that the recess is to study the progress made to date. A Soviet newspaper reporter claimed that the main obstacle to a satisfactory solution between the United States and Japan is Japan's insistence on the Axis Pact. According to Japanese sources, the failure of Kurusu's mission is expected, saying that if Japan's policy is as proposed by the Japanese Prime Minister, the United States believes that there is no room for continued negotiations.</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd (International News Service) – It is learned that the U.S. demand for Japan to withdraw its troops from China is still the most difficult issue to resolve in the talks with Japan. Washington is now insisting on the withdrawal of most of the Japanese troops in China. Informed sources believe that if the talks break down, the main reason will be the inability to reach an agreement on this issue. The second major obstacle is the U.S. demand for equal commercial opportunities for all countries in China. It is said that Hull insists that Japan must accept this point as a major basis for practical negotiations. It is widely believed that Japanese representatives have expressed their willingness to abandon their aggressive plans in the Pacific except for China in return for the United States easing economic sanctions. Sources say that Kurusu and Nomura have so far responded ambiguously to the U.S. demand that Japan withdraw from the Axis, but have given the U.S. the impression that if Japan and the United States can reach a full understanding on all other points, Japan will regard the agreement with the Axis powers as a dead letter.</p>

<p>Reuters, Oakland, 22nd - British Cabinet's Far East representative, Sir Shenton Thomas, arriving from Sydney, told guests that he believes the Thai people, if attacked, will defend their country. The British Minister to Bangkok also stated that although the Thai people lack equipment, they will not willingly retreat if attacked. Given the rapid developments in the Far East, he has dispatched a staff member to London carrying a preliminary report on the centralization of authority. He hopes that some necessary improvements will be implemented promptly. The previous delays on the Burma Road, due to multiple lines of command, are now being streamlined. Although his time in Malaya was short, he is aware of the significant progress made in Malayan defenses and the close cooperation with the Dutch East Indies. He was deeply impressed by Australia's significant progress in its war efforts, and New Zealand's adoption of conscription is a commendable effort for the most distant part of the British Empire from the center of the war. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, in welcoming Sir Shenton Thomas yesterday, praised his attitude, saying that he opposed the appeasement policy and preferred to resign rather than change his original intention. Sir Shenton Thomas is a member of the British War Cabinet and also represents the British people. Today, the greatest honor is to be a representative of the great people.</p>

<p>International News Service, Washington, 22nd - Secretary of State Hull warned Japanese representatives yesterday that any Japanese threat to Thailand would severely damage the ongoing US-Japanese talks. It is reported that this warning was personally delivered to the Japanese representatives by Hull when he invited Special Envoy Kurusu and General Nomura to the State Department, due to diplomatic reports that Japanese troops are conducting military operations on the Thai-Vietnam border.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 22nd - A Lao spokesman, speaking from Radio Rangoon in Thai last night, appealed to the Asian people to unite and resist the common enemy, saying that he is one of the Thai compatriots and eager to speak to the Thai compatriots in the capacity of a representative of Laos. The so-called common enemy is Japan. Japan claims to have mediated the dispute between Thailand and Vietnam and to have rendered meritorious service to Thailand, and accuses Thailand of ingratitude. This unfounded accusation is likely to be used as a pretext for provocation. It is hoped that Thai compatriots will quickly prepare themselves and firmly believe that their neighbors, the Lao and Burmese people, are by their side and facing the same crisis.</p>

<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 22nd - Tokyo Radio threatened the Soviet Union last night, accusing it of insincerity in its reply to Japan's protest over the sinking of the Japanese ship Kibi Maru, and said that Japan may use other means to correct this. The people's righteous indignation towards the Soviet Union has now erupted.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 22nd - The Kokumin Shimbun declared that because Japan's "Kibi Maru" was sunk by a Soviet torpedo, if the Soviet Union continues its strategy of "equivocation and delay" after Japan lodges a protest, Japan may abandon the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact and take more aggressive steps. After the newspaper's commentary was published, the Domei News Agency also quoted informed sources as making the same declaration, saying that the Soviet Union's "dishonest attitude" of laying mines to sink Japanese ships and taking Japanese lives has aroused national anger and a "serious trend." Domei News Agency said that although it is generally predicted that Japan will be "drawn into the ocean of war" after the German-Soviet war breaks out, Japan still maintains "strict neutrality under the non-aggression pact." It also said that Japan's maintaining neutrality in the German-Soviet war shows that Japan hopes to resolve the torpedo incident as soon as possible, such as the sinking of the "Kibi Maru" off the coast of Korea, which resulted in the loss of many lives.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that he had not heard of the severance of diplomatic relations with Vichy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd - Secretary of State Hull, in response to questions about the new atmosphere in French-American relations after Weygand's dismissal yesterday, said that the State Department is currently collecting various facts about French-German cooperation. Yesterday, he stated that the United States is now reconsidering its relations with France. He cannot add anything further to this.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 22nd - Republican Congressman Stearns of New Hampshire introduced a bill in the House yesterday calling on the United States to recognize the Telko government. This bill was introduced at a time when relations between Washington and Vichy are deteriorating. According to government sources, Vichy's adoption of this action was at the "special request of Germany." The State Department believes that Weygand's departure may presage Germany's takeover of this key French West African port and naval base in Dakar, so the State Department declared two days ago that relations between the United States and Vichy must now be revised. Some quarters believe this statement may foreshadow the breakdown of US-French relations.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 22nd - It is rumored that Hitler will meet with Marshal Pétain "somewhere in occupied France" next week to request permission to send German troops to French North Africa to counter the British offensive in Libya. This meeting is widely regarded as the first consequence of General Weygand's dismissal. It is generally believed that Pétain will request the release of more French prisoners and a reduction in occupation costs in exchange for German troops entering Africa.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Alexander Announces Increased British Naval Defenses in the Far East. U.S. Invites British, Australian, and Dutch Envoys to Meeting. Burma Issues Communiqué Saying War or Peace Depends on Japan's Decision. <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, speaking in Bristol today, mentioned the potential dangers that may occur at any time in the Far East, saying that he still finds it hard to believe that none of the many leaders of Japan will offer wise advice and plunge another region into turmoil and expose the Japanese people to the dangers that their leaders will inevitably face if they wage a war of aggression. We are now able to transfer powerful reinforcements to the eastern seas, which shows the increasing strength of our fleet, the number of naval personnel has tripled, and it has been proven that we are suitable for life at sea.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 22nd - First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander announced yesterday that the Royal Navy has sailed to potential trouble spots to strengthen its military power in the Far East. He said that the current strength of the Royal Navy is sufficient to allocate forces to the Far East for reinforcements compared to July, but Alexander declined to disclose details, only saying that the reinforcements "have already become a reality."</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 22nd - U.S. Secretary of State Hull today discussed the Far East situation with British, Australian, and Dutch East Indies diplomats. Officials discussed the Far East situation, and Hull may have informed the envoys of the progress of the U.S.-Japan talks.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 22nd - Undersecretary of State Welles wrote in yesterday's edition of "Overseas Business Weekly" that the danger the United States is currently encountering is even greater than when it entered the war in 1917. He said, "In the Atlantic, a brutal conqueror has placed half of Europe under its control. In the Far East, the same conquering force is threatening the Pacific nations." However, Welles concluded optimistically, saying, "We have no doubt that the forces of freedom and good people will ultimately achieve final victory."</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 22nd - The Director of Information of the Burmese government issued a communiqué last night, saying that according to reliable sources, the wild rhetoric of Japanese newspapers and the radical tone of some Japanese government officials are in fact expressions of Tokyo's hesitation and despair. Now is the time for the Pacific democracies to know that the initiative in Southeast Asia is now in the hands of the Allied Powers rather than the Axis Powers. This view is based on the blockade of Japanese commerce and the freezing of Japanese funds, because the entire Japanese economy is now suffering a very serious blow as a result. This is a fact that will sooner or later force Japan to decide its course of action, but Britain and its allied countries have now decided on their course of action, which is not to want a war in the Pacific, but at the same time to have preparations that are more thorough than people expect. War or peace is up to Japan. As far as Britain is concerned, Japan's repeated threats have failed to make Britain change its policy in Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Entire Board of Directors of Japan's Imperial Rule Assistance Association Resigns. <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd - The directors of the House of Representatives' Imperial Rule Assistance Association decided yesterday to accept full responsibility for the "inappropriate remarks" made by Association member Miyazawa on Wednesday criticizing the government's economic policies, and therefore resigned en masse. Miyazawa had already resigned after making the critical speech. Japanese news agencies quoted observers as saying that the resignation of the entire board of directors may lead to a public split in the Association, with the possibility of a new association being formed by those who sympathize with Miyazawa or are dissatisfied with the Association's policies.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd - Responsible authorities announced last night that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's son has been captured on the Eastern Front. This young man is the son of Molotov's first wife and bears his father's surname, Shikjerbin. He is 22 years old, a student of agricultural science. He has been in the military for two years and has been in military officer training for half a year, but is still an ordinary soldier. He said he does not like military life.</p>

<h3 id="e25">From Passive to Active <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The arduous battle between the Soviet Union and Germany has entered its sixth month as the harsh winter approaches. In recent days, German forces have once again gathered reinforcements and launched a final, fierce offensive against Moscow. On the Crimean Peninsula, after the unfortunate fall of Kerch, German forces are only a stone's throw away from their ultimate goal, the Caucasus. However, on the other hand, even if we disregard the German losses and attrition, just considering the speed of their advance, we can see that they are gradually becoming exhausted, lacking the vigor they displayed in the Western Front and Balkan campaigns. No one can say for sure how long the Nazi war machine can continue or how much reinforcement it can provide, but in any case, its strength is diminishing with each passing point, unable to obtain reinforcements or replenishment from other parts of the world. Although Europe is vast, its manpower and resources are not inexhaustible. Lately, reports of German peace offensives have been seen frequently, and recently, they have coerced Vichy to revive the old tune of German-French cooperation. This can be considered one of Hitler's strengths, as well as a preparation to explore other avenues for development due to the prolonged and indecisive war against the Soviet Union and the onset of winter. Overworked people inevitably age prematurely, and Genghis Khan's vast empire could only last for less than a century. Applying the precedents of the equestrian and archery era to the modern age of mechanization and blitzkrieg, we can safely say that the golden age of Nazi aggression has gradually become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>If we examine the entire democratic front's rise and fall against the forces of aggression from the Soviet-German war, we may feel that the progress of events is too slow and sluggish, failing to satisfy. However, the entire process is a remarkable progress and is moving towards a qualitative leap from quantitative change. The era of Munich need not be mentioned. Even a year ago, aggressor nations had an overwhelming advantage. Major democratic powers were either merely seeking to protect themselves or were intentionally or unintentionally pursuing some kind of appeasement. The idea and desire for a united anti-aggression existed everywhere, but it never materialized or became a torrent. By last winter, the German air raids on Britain had failed, and the US elections had come to an end. At that time, the forces of violence in the East and West, feeling isolated, allied with each other in the hope of increasing their strength and deterring the Allied countries. As a result, this反而 prompted the consistent and resolute response of the democratic countries. Britain abandoned the last vestiges of its appeasement policy towards the Far East, while the United States, in addition to expressing a firm attitude, also loaned money to China, passed the Lend-Lease Act, and actively engaged in aid programs to China and Britain, taking on the task of eradicating piracy in the Atlantic Ocean with Britain. Only then did the international situation reveal a new dawn. As the Soviet-German war broke out, on the one hand, the long-imagined joint anti-aggression action by China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union gradually materialized. On the other hand, the aggressors themselves opened up a battlefield that gradually depleted their own strength. Britain, after gaining some respite, was able to intensify its equipment, increase production, and prepare for a counteroffensive. In addition to strict vigilance in the North Sea and the Atlantic, it also cleared the threat in the Middle East and participated in the ABCD defense in the Far East. After the fundamental revision of the US Neutrality Act, armed merchant ships were able to sail directly into the war zone, greatly facilitating the supply of war materials to Britain and the United States, indirectly and rapidly increasing the strength of anti-aggression operations. As for the aggressors, the Nazis were mired in the Soviet Union, and the ABCD line had already laid a net of contingency in the South Pacific. Even if some developments were not yet fully mature, the entire world situation had indeed reached a new turning point. Specifically, the current problem is not only how to resist the aggressor's offensive but how to extinguish and destroy the root of the evil of aggression.</p>
<p>This situation is most evident in the recent actions of Britain. According to British Prime Minister Churchill's report to the British Parliament a few days ago, the plan to counterattack Europe has not yet reached the time for action, but in the Middle East and the Far East, they have resolutely taken the initiative. After expressing its willingness to fight side by side with the United States in the Far East, the defenses of its Far Eastern territories are rapidly increasing. Recently, Canadian troops have reinforced Hong Kong, and a large number of Australian troops have arrived in Singapore. According to British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, it has been confirmed that British ships have also sailed from East Asia to strengthen the strength of their Far Eastern fleet. Since the 18th of this month, British forces in North Africa have launched a fierce offensive against Italian-held Libya, penetrating more than a hundred miles into Italian territory in a week, crossing the long-held fortress of Tobruk to the west. Although this may seem like a re-enactment of the offensive led by Sir Wavell last October, at a time when the Soviet Union is calling for a second battlefield to be opened as soon as possible, and the German forces are stuck on the Soviet front and intensifying their desire for French North African colonies, the great significance of this move is not just to eliminate the last remnants of the Italian Empire in Africa and fight a decisive battle with some mechanized German forces.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, talks are currently underway in Washington between the United States and Japan to seek a peaceful resolution. On the surface, it seems that there is a difference in urgency between Britain and the United States, and some people inevitably misunderstand the attitude of US policy. But Britain at this time is a belligerent with almost no wars to fight. As long as it has a grip on strength, it can launch an offensive anytime, anywhere. As for the United States, it still stands on the edge of war, and all its advances and retreats can only be considered from the perspective of its non-belligerent status. Britain can immediately launch a war to attack Libya. If the United States is prepared to occupy Dakar, it must first break down the barriers to joining the war, although that may be easily accomplished when necessary. However, although there may be differences in measures between the two countries, there is no difference in their positions. The Luoqiu Declaration and the repeated statements made by the US authorities are sufficient to guarantee that the Washington talks are merely testing whether it is still effective to curb aggression by peaceful means. Today, no country can be allowed to repeat the mistakes of the appeasement policy. Moreover, in addition to the talks, the United States has also completed the necessary final preparations, with five of the six 35,000-ton battleships being completed within this year, which is not something to be taken lightly. If the talks fail and "peace" is hopeless, then the United States' further attitude will inevitably be a leap from passive to active, just like Britain.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Fierce Fighting Continues in the Western Desert, German Tanks Suffer Heavy Losses, Britain Adopts Large-Scale Blitzkrieg Strategy, Rommel's German Troops Encircled <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd - A major tank battle between British and German forces is raging in the desolate desert, covering over a thousand square miles. According to responsible sources in Cairo, the battle is progressing very smoothly. German tanks have lost half of their numbers, and their tank fleet has suffered three times the losses of the British. The North African German forces under General Rommel have been encircled and are desperately trying to break out, but their situation has become even more unfavorable. According to a communiqué issued by the British General Headquarters in Cairo, the fighting in Cyrenaica was extremely fierce on Thursday afternoon. After losing 70 tanks, 33 armored vehicles, and hundreds of prisoners, the German forces retreated. The battle took place near Rezia. Subsequently, another British armored force engaged in a battle with a German tank force between Rezia and Omar. Other British armored and mechanized columns have made deep advances. The British Air Force is providing strong support, soaring over the entire battlefield and bombing fiercely. The communiqué last night provides a glimpse of the current situation. The British plan is clearly to repeat General Wavell's tactics of last year with a larger-scale surprise attack. However, Wavell repeatedly used small encirclement operations to cut off the enemy's retreat. Now, General Auchinleck is sending troops to the enemy's rear to cut off their retreat. German commander Rommel has dispatched tanks in all directions, and in the Rezia area, he is clearly trying to prevent British forces from making contact with the British garrison in Tobruk, so it is not easy for British forces to join forces, because in addition to tanks, the enemy has recently laid mines within the range of enemy artillery fire outside Tobruk. According to a Reuters correspondent in the central part of the Western Desert, at least one thing in last night's communiqué was quite exciting, namely the heavy losses suffered by enemy tanks. These must include the most important and best German tanks, which shows that the British military equipment this time, as British Prime Minister Churchill said, is at least a match for enemy weapons. According to the communiqué, British forces are continuing to exert heavy pressure on the enemy forces stubbornly defending between Halfaya and Omar. At the same time, British Empire forces, aided by British tanks, are advancing rapidly northwards west of Bardia. In other parts of this major battlefield, large British armored and mechanized forces are making deep advances in all directions, threatening the enemy's main lines of communication.</p>
<p>Great Battle West of Capuzzo, British Forces Attacking the Coast Fiercely</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 22nd - The largest battle in African history is continuing 45 miles west of Capuzzo. It is reported that German tanks have lost half of their numbers. Responsible sources here claim that the initiative is still with the British. German forces have launched three counterattacks, all of which have been repulsed. Their tank losses are far heavier than those of the British. Nazi African Army commander Rommel is now not only retreating but also trying to break out. Cairo believes that the reason why no Axis aircraft are assisting in North Africa is not because of fuel economy but because enemy aircraft cannot take off. The reason is that after rainfall, the British sandy airfields quickly absorb the rainwater, and the airfields can still be used. The enemy's airfields around Derna and elsewhere are made of red soil, which immediately becomes muddy when it rains, making it impossible for aircraft to take off. According to indirect news here, British forces occupied the Rezia airfield after a brief engagement with enemy forces. The speed of the British advance can be seen from this. When the British armored units suddenly attacked the airfield, there were 50 enemy pilots and service personnel in the airfield, who were unable to escape and were all captured. There were 19 enemy aircraft in the airfield, which had been strafed by British aircraft the day before and were still parked in the airfield. The British Eighth Army advanced 50 miles on the first day of its invasion of Libya, occupying Rezia, only 10 miles from Tobruk, without encountering significant resistance, which proves that the British advance route is south of the area where the main German forces are located, launching an encirclement operation and attacking the coast fiercely. If they make contact with Tobruk, then the large German and Italian forces between Tobruk and Sollum will be surrounded. It is believed that there are two German armored divisions among these enemy forces.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Fierce Fighting Continues: Moscow Situation Grave; Soviets Concentrate Elite Forces to Defend Capital; Germans Claim Occupation of Rostov <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 22nd: A special correspondent for the "Pravda" newspaper reports that the battle for Moscow is ongoing. A letter found on the body of a German sergeant named Littel stated that Hitler had issued an order: "In view of the severe winter and the difficulty of supplying the army, I hereby order all officers and men to end the Soviet capital of Moscow at any cost within the nearest period." At the same time, Hitler informed his soldiers that seizing Moscow would bring peace. Currently, the German command is attacking with half of its tank divisions and reserves. Drunken German troops are advancing with wild shouts. In some areas, our troops have been forced to retreat. The situation in Moscow is grave. Our troops are holding their ground and launching counterattacks. For example, a certain tank unit annihilated 2,500 enemies in two days and destroyed 35 tanks and 80 machine guns.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 22nd: The "Red Star" newspaper wrote that the establishment of the Guards divisions was not for parades. Their emergence coincides with a cruel war. The appearance of these future conquerors coincides with a life-and-death struggle against fascism. Their strength and composure are derived from this. The Soviet Guards began with eight infantry divisions, the Moscow Motorized Infantry Corps, and Katukov's tank brigade. In the Battle of Orel, Major General Katukov's tank brigade inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, destroying 133 tanks, 49 artillery pieces, eight aircraft, and wiping out almost an entire enemy regiment. The commanders and soldiers of this unit fought with all their might, constantly developing tactics. The acquisition of the title of the First Guards Division by the infantry division of Zhilicianov was not accidental, but because they fought with flesh and blood, destroying more than 200 enemy tanks. The First Guards Division's resistance to the enemy in Minsk assisted the advance of our main forces.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: The German High Command announced this afternoon that German mechanized units and SS troops, under the command of General Kleist, had occupied Rostov after fierce fighting. The city is a center of Soviet commerce and transportation, adding considerable convenience to future German operations. The German Air Force, under the leadership of General Kleist, distinguished itself in this battle. In other sectors of the Eastern Front, German troops continue to make progress. An enemy attempt to break out in the Leningrad area failed, losing 15 tanks. German General Blissen was killed in action on the Eastern Front on the 20th.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: Military sources revealed this morning that German mechanized units and SS troops have occupied Rostov, this important Soviet industrial center, finally falling after a major battle. It was also stated that this is the second time in history that German troops have occupied this important Soviet commercial area. The first time was on May 7th and 8th, 1918, when German troops under Eichhorn entered the city. After the occupation of Rostov, one of the two railroads connecting the Soviet Union to the Caucasus has fallen into German hands. According to a 1939 survey, Rostov had a population of 500,000. The city can manufacture railroad locomotives and aircraft, and has a canal connecting to the Volga.</p>
<h3 id="e28">German and Soviet Tanks Engage in Night Combat <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: Fierce fighting has resumed on the Eastern Front, especially in the outskirts of Moscow. A TASS correspondent, describing the details of the Battle of Moscow, stated that German troops, gathering a large number of tanks and mechanized infantry, launched an offensive in several areas on the night of the 19th. There was fierce fighting in the central, northern, and southern sectors of the Soviet defense line, with the fighting being particularly intense in the northern sector of the Moscow front. In that area, German troops launched repeated attacks that night, but were heavily damaged and retreated. On the same night, a Soviet counterattack recovered two villages, destroyed a German army headquarters, and destroyed many tanks, trucks, motorcycles, and artillery pieces. As a result of a fierce tank battle in the "〇" area, the German army was defeated. The next day, the German army sent 50 tanks with infantry to try to advance again, resulting in a fierce battle that continued until late the next night. The German army advanced only one or two miles at a heavy cost, occupying several villages. In the Volokolamsk area, the German army, including four divisions of Zhukov's army, three infantry divisions, and one assault division, attacked simultaneously in several places in an attempt to break through the Soviet line and attack the Soviet rear. On the 19th, German troops made wedge-shaped incursions into several points of the Soviet line. The fierce fighting is still ongoing. Several villages have changed hands several times. According to a report from the "Pravda" newspaper, the fighting in the Dula area continued for three days. At night, hundreds of German tanks attacked, engaging in battle with Soviet tank units in the darkness. The German tanks in this area lost 50 vehicles, dozens of trucks, and many soldiers, but the German army is currently continuing to attempt to advance.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Soviet Losses in Five Months: Figures Released by the German Side <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 22nd: German authorities announced last night that in the five months of the war against the Soviet Union, Germany and its allies have occupied 1.7 million square kilometers of land, with a Soviet population of 190 million. Approximately 75 million people live in the occupied areas. As of November 20, 3,792,600 Soviet soldiers have been captured. A total of 389 Soviet divisions have been completely annihilated. In other words, the total number of Soviet casualties, injuries, and captured soldiers reached 10 million. More than 22,000 armored vehicles, 27,452 artillery pieces, and 15,877 aircraft have been destroyed or captured. Most of the Soviet navy and merchant ships in the Baltic and Black Seas have been destroyed. 47 warships have been sunk and 54 heavily damaged. 119 merchant ships have been sunk, totaling 385,650 tons. In addition, 89 merchant ships of uncounted tonnage have also been sunk, and 122 heavily damaged. Countless Soviet transportation trains have been damaged. At least 17,000 cargo trucks have been destroyed.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Security in US Military Zone to Be Handled by Police; Assistance from Volunteer Corps to Be Requested When Necessary; Same Method Adopted for Defense of Area B <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The American President liner President Madison arrived at the port at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, docking at pontoons 14 and 15. Details have already been reported in previous newspapers. It is learned that a large batch of goods was transported from the United States this time, including 14,000 bags of flour, which are relief flour, to be handled by the Red Cross. Only 23 passengers disembarked in Shanghai. There were no passengers on the original ship bound for the Philippines. The base of the US Fourth Marines Regiment has been moved to the dock for loading onto ships for several days.</p>
<p>Police Takeover Proposed</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Intelligence Department, the council has proposed that after the US Fourth Marine Regiment withdraws from Shanghai, the responsibility for maintaining security in Area C will be borne by the SMC Police Department. The Police Department will request assistance from the Volunteer Corps when necessary. In the event of a serious emergency, the council will request assistance from other defensive forces in the International Settlement. The council has also proposed that the exact same methods applicable to Area C-1 will be implemented in Area B. That is, the responsibility for maintaining security will be borne by the SMC Police Department, requesting assistance from the Volunteer Corps when necessary.</p>
<p>Takeover Procedures Begin Today</p>
<p>Since the SMC has already issued the above notice and all affairs have been completely decided without a doubt, the procedures for taking over the US military zone will be gradually carried out starting today, aiming to be completed before the first batch of US military withdrawals next Tuesday. These procedures will be handled by the police stations in each district of the US military zone. It has been verified that the defense along the Suzhou Creek from the New Zha Gate Bridge to Yichang Road was taken over by personnel dispatched by the Putuo Road Police Station under the order of the SMC Police Department on the 18th. All military telephones and watchtowers set up by the US military have been removed first. The defense of the remaining sections of the valley will also be taken over using the same method.</p>
<p>Increase in Japanese Police Cases Also Proposed</p>
<p>Responsible persons confirmed yesterday morning that the Japanese have proposed a plan to increase the number of Japanese police officers in the SMC Police Department. Business sources with good information recently indicated that they believe the Japanese will abandon their request to patrol Area C in exchange for an increase in the number of Japanese officers in the Police Department. It is also heard that the SMC recently announced that the decision to manage Area C by the Police Department was made by the American, Italian, and Japanese members of the Shanghai Defense Force Committee, the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and the Commissioner of Police communicating amongst each other the day before yesterday afternoon, rather than holding a meeting as expected.</p>
<p>Outcome Still Difficult to Predict</p>
<p>Responsible persons stated yesterday that the issue of increasing the number of Japanese police officers in the International Settlement is still up in the air. The Japanese side has indeed made this suggestion. After the assassination of Akagi, the Special Deputy Commissioner of Police, the strength of the Japanese officers in the Police Department is below standard. The Japanese now want to send personnel to fill Akagi's vacancy and further increase the number of Japanese officers in the Police Department, but the number of people to be added is not large. It has been verified that the SMC's existing police force, with the assistance of the Volunteer Corps, is already extremely strong. Based on past experience, this strength is sufficient to cope with any serious emergency. The security of this port can be optimistic as long as the authorities' measures deeply win the hearts of the people.</p>
<p>US Military Procurement Office Also Closes</p>
<p>The US Naval Material Procurement Office is now ending its 27-year history in Shanghai, preparing to withdraw along with the Fourth Marine Regiment. It is heard that the office staff will leave Shanghai on the President Madison or President Harrison. The office in the Enterprise Building and the items stored in the warehouse were all cleared out yesterday morning. At the same time, Colonel Howard, the commander of the Fourth Marine Regiment, was busy yesterday with farewell banquets from various agencies in this port.</p>
<p>Various Parties Host Farewell Banquets and Present Souvenirs</p>
<p>The Naval Attaché of the US Consulate hosted a banquet at the Cercle Sportif Français to entertain Colonel Howard and other officers of the Fourth Marine Regiment. The American Club will host all officers of the Fourth Marine Regiment from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM on Monday (the 24th). From 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the same afternoon, the enlisted men of the regiment will be hosted. On Tuesday (the 25th), Colonel Howard and other officers will be hosted at a luncheon at the Shanghai Club by the leading British residents of Shanghai. The banquet will be hosted by the British Residents Association and will begin at 1:00 PM that afternoon. British community groups in this port will send representatives to participate at that time. Members of the Royal Society will present Colonel Howard with a set of commemorative plates. On Wednesday (the 26th), the St. George's Society will host a banquet to entertain Colonel Howard. The diplomatic representatives of Chile, Mexico, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Brazil in this port hosted a luncheon at the Columbia Country Club to entertain Howard and other officers. At that time, the Chilean Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General gave a speech praising all the officers of the Fourth Marine Regiment. At the same time, the Fourth Marine Regiment published the last issue of its "Oorah! Oorah! Weekly" in Shanghai this morning. It is expected that many people will attend the Fourth Marine Regiment's service held at the Grand Theater this morning.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) in the International Settlement originally stipulated that a census of the settlement be conducted every five years. After the survey in 1935, it was delayed last year due to budget constraints. It is now learned that the council, in view of the dense population, if conducting the survey manually, would be economically and time-wise inconvenient. Therefore, it plans to change to other methods to engage in survey work. There are not many days left this year, and it is feared that it will not be possible to proceed. Perhaps the survey will be carried out in the next year.</p>

<p>The Panamanian cargo ship "Santay Enatz" ran aground near the mouth of the Woosung River on its way from Shanghai to Manila this Wednesday. It has been hit by huge waves since then and has not been rescued. According to personnel from the East Asia Company, the ship's agency in this city, the ship's situation is critical. Efforts have been made to rescue its 40 crew members. The rescue ship "Carmen Mahler" has been ordered to go to rescue the crew of the cargo ship. The weather outside the harbor has been bad for the past few days, hindering efforts to rescue the ship. It is expected that some of the cargo on board has been flooded and damaged. It is heard that the Santay Enatz weighed anchor from Shanghai early Wednesday morning and ran aground less than 25 miles out. The East Asia Company will continue to rescue the ship as soon as the weather permits, so that the ship can be towed back to Shanghai for repairs. It was learned that the Japanese ship "Bassa Maru," which sank in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, outside the mouth of the Woosung River, within 10 miles, had about 200 passengers and crew members who sank with the ship. Although salvage efforts were made, there was no trace of them. Therefore, the Japanese shipping company has now abandoned hope of salvage, but is still trying to find out where the ship sank. The weather has improved in the past few days, and it is expected that divers will be sent again to explore.</p>

<p>Since the Construction, a large dredger from the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Dredging Bureau, was requisitioned by the Japanese, the original crew of the ship have been dismissed. However, the crew members unanimously opposed the bureau's dismissal, believing it to be unreasonable. Yesterday, they made three demands to the bureau: (1) Severance pay equal to five years' salary for each person. (2) Payment of the last month's salary as usual. (3) The bureau should compensate for the loss of bedding and luggage suffered by the crew during the Shanghai war.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Intelligence Department, the second batch of maximum retail price lists has been approved and announced by the council and will be implemented from the 24th of this month. There are many items listed in the table that are subject to price controls, mostly medicines and food. Due to the time required for translation, Chinese newspapers are unable to publish them at the same time. Retail stores selling the items listed in the table must sell them at the controlled price from the above date and must not exceed it. In addition, the prices of some items listed in the first batch of price lists have now been changed and are noted in the second batch of price lists.</p>
<p>Drawbacks of Over-Purchasing Price-Controlled Goods</p>
<p>Since the publication of the first batch of price lists, it has been found that citizens and retailers tend to over-purchase and over-order items listed in the table. This kind of action is enough to undermine the original plan to maintain a constant supply at reasonable prices. In the future, it is hoped that for the benefit of the public, purchases will be limited as much as possible, aiming only to meet the minimum needs. (The English version of the first batch of price lists has now been printed and sells for five cents each. It can be purchased from the SMC Rates and Taxes Office.)</p>
<p>This Price Control Divided into Two Major Categories</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) issued the second retail price control list yesterday, listing various goods managed and manufactured by more than ten commercial firms such as Tiensheng Foreign Firm, divided into two major categories: food and medicine. From November 24th, retail of these goods in the International Settlement must not exceed the controlled price.</p>
<p>Retail Stores Actually Refuse to Sell Kerosene</p>
<p>Since the two settlements authorities have been managing prices, the prices of various daily necessities have fallen across the board. After the recent announcement of price controls, the trend of rising prices has been curbed. However, general tobacco and grocery retail stores have suddenly refused to sell kerosene to retail customers. After verifying the actual situation, it is found that there are stocks, and this kind of obstruction phenomenon urgently needs to be sanctioned by the authorities.</p>
<p>Tofu Prices Also to Be Assessed</p>
<p>The tofu industry yesterday submitted two requests to the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC): (1) Please instruct the bean industry to reduce the price of beans to 10 yuan per 100 market catties (currently 110 yuan), then the industry will not only maintain business but also voluntarily reduce the price of tofu to ease the burden on civilians. If the price of beans is not reduced, the industry can only increase prices. (2) Consider a method of appropriately increasing the price of tofu. The above requests were submitted to the settlement authorities yesterday. The settlement authorities believe that tofu is a daily necessity, and not only should the price not be raised to increase the burden on citizens, but also the price should be assessed to benefit the public.</p>
<p>Measures for Selling Rice in Western Shanghai Determined</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Price Control Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) said yesterday in response to questions about the rice shortage that the SMC's arrangement for supplying Western Shanghai retail stores with foreign rice has now been completed. The procedures for distributing rice and other procedures are quite time-consuming, but preparations are now underway and rice will soon be distributed to rice stores in the western district for retail, using the same method as currently implemented in the International Settlement, it was said. The spokesman also refuted the claim that some rice stores in the International Settlement refused to sell SMC foreign rice because of meager profits. It is said that the bureau is now supplying sufficient foreign rice to approved retail rice stores to meet public demand.</p>
<p>Rice Transportation Restores Permit System</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) recently issued a notice stating that from the 24th of this month, permits for transporting various rice grains will be issued, with a fee of two cents for each bag. The method for shipping the remaining 8,320 bags of the first batch of collective rice sales has also been decided. The Food Management Committee issued rice transportation permits the day before yesterday and handed them over to the Rice Merchants Association, which distributed them to the rice merchants yesterday morning. 132 registered rice merchants lacking rice started to collect transportation permits from the Shanhai Pass Road Rice Merchants Association yesterday. After payment, they can collect the vouchers and quickly ship the goods to meet retail demand. After obtaining rice grains, the rice merchants are not allowed to mix the rice grains regardless of their quality and must sell them to the public according to the incoming goods. The Libek Foreign Firm, which handles SMC foreign rice on behalf of the SMC, is still approving rice merchants lacking rice to purchase SMC foreign rice every day, with a total of about 5,000 bags per day, so the supply of food for the people in this city is currently very normal.</p>

<p>The British Embassy in China issued a notice the day before yesterday stating that it had decided to dispatch a special ship to carry British nationals from the occupied areas and evacuate them from Shanghai on the Anhui Wheel at the end of this month. According to the reporter of the Plain Language News Agency, the British authorities' evacuation of British nationals this time is more active than in the past. It is estimated that more than 80% of the British nationals ordered to evacuate will evacuate. The Taikoo Company's Taiyuan Wheel, which is scheduled to sail to Singapore on the 28th of this month, has been ordered to stop selling passenger tickets for the large pantry and first-class cabins on the ship in order to provide accommodation for British nationals to evacuate.</p>
<p>Most of the Space on Special Ships Has Been Booked</p>
<p>According to the American President Line, two ships sent by the United States to Shanghai for evacuation have a total of 200 berths for the evacuation of American nationals. 150 of them have already been booked. Women and children account for 70% to 80% of the American nationals who have booked these tickets for evacuation. The first President ship President Madison sent by the United States to evacuate soldiers and civilians has entered the port. Only Shou Jun, who returned to the country after engaging in research work at the University of California in the United States, boarded the ship from San Francisco to Shanghai. According to Shou Jun, after leaving Honolulu, the President Madison sailed to Shanghai via the South Seas, and the passengers did not know where the ship was going. The second evacuation ship is expected to arrive in port in the early part of next week. At the same time, British nationals in Shanghai who intend to evacuate were hastily preparing yesterday morning to board the Anhui ship, which is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 28th of this month, to set sail.</p>
<p>British Nationals in Hankou Take Ships to Shanghai</p>
<p>In view of the urgency of the international situation, 22 British nationals residing in Hankou took ships to Shanghai on the 21st. Most of the remaining British nationals are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 27th and transfer to ships to return to their countries. Since the British and American consuls-general issued recommendations last year urging nationals of their respective countries to evacuate, only 140 British nationals remain in Hankou (including 100 for religious reasons), 50 American nationals (including 35 for religious reasons). In addition, there are about 100 German nationals, 120 Italian nationals, 50 French nationals, 200 White Russian nationals, and 100 Indian nationals.</p>

<p>Personnel engaged in relief work said yesterday morning that since the weather suddenly turned cold three days ago, about 250 beggars have been found frozen to death on the streets of the city. If relief is not provided immediately and food and shelter are not provided, the number of bodies exposed on the streets every night will gradually increase as the weather gets colder. 100 exposed bodies were found in the International Settlement on Thursday night, 70 of which were children's bodies, all of whom were scantily clad and unable to withstand the cold. Although the Salvation Army is now stepping up relief efforts, the only way to greatly reduce the number of beggars who are starving, freezing, and dying is to quickly establish the planned beggar shelter on Zhongshan Road. The authorities of the two settlements have approved this plan, and now only formal approval from a certain party is awaited. In view of the sudden cold weather, the Salvation Army plans to distribute cotton clothes and start sending out soup kitchens, loading hot meals every night and distributing them to the beggars.</p>

<p>Designated Primary Schools to Select Children</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper published an announcement about adding one hundred places for junior primary school. The proposal has been agreed upon and is determined to proceed. As children entering primary school do not have report cards for review, some adjustments have to be made. The newspaper now plans to entrust ten well-known primary schools in the concessions to recruit poor children nearby, and under the name of "Shen Bao Readers' Bursary Fund Free Places," conduct examinations. Those who are truly unable to afford schooling but have potential will be given free education. Matters such as the allocation of designated places for schools will be decided at a committee meeting.</p>
<p>Deadline for Free Application to Engineering College</p>
<p>The Nanyang Wireless Chemical Industry College generously donated five free and five half-fee places for each class. Many applications have been received and are being sorted and reviewed. Once the review process is complete, the results will be officially announced. However, the number of free places is limited, and there are many applicants, so the application deadline is today.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a letter from Shanghai Engineering College stated, "In response to the Reader's Bursary Fund movement of your newspaper, we specially reserve fifteen half-fee places for the second term, including five places each for the first year of the Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Department, the Industrial and Commercial Management Department, and the preparatory class.

A huge ransom was demanded, but due to the inability to raise 400,000 yuan, the ransom was delayed. Later, the concession police learned of the case and sent detectives to wait on Guangdong Road, where they apprehended a suspect, Zhu Wenlong (a retired soldier). Based on his confession, six male and female criminals were arrested in Changzhou, Jiangyin, and other places. The victim has not been rescued. The suspects were taken to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning, and a request was made for another extension because the victim has been rescued by someone and negotiations are underway.

<p>Yesterday, three rice shops in the Public Concession were attacked with bombs and gunfire in succession, and warning leaflets were distributed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shen Chang Attacked with Bomb</p>
<p>The first case occurred around 8:20 AM yesterday morning. A man carrying a cloth bag containing a bomb made of a lead can went to Shen Chang Rice Shop at No. 200, Kaifeng Road, and threw it into the shop while customers were crowding to buy rice. It landed on the floor next to the counter inside the shop but did not explode. At first, shop assistant Zhang Guifu did not realize it was an explosive, but then he discovered it and immediately reported it to the police, who sent officers to take it away for destruction. It was also reported that several printed leaflets with black characters on white paper were found outside the shop, containing warning words. It was found that the shop was jointly opened by Lian Donglin and others from Pudong and has been in business for ten years.</p>
<p>Heng Sheng Attacked</p>
<p>About half an hour after the first case, two men also went to Heng Sheng Rice Shop at No. 44, Xinzha Road, and mixed in with the crowd of customers. They pulled out box guns, fired three shots inside, and scattered leaflets with warning words. One bullet hit the porcelain gourd on the electric light in the shop, and fragments flew everywhere, but fortunately, no one was injured. Later, nearby patrol officers arrived, but the shooters had already disappeared. They took the shell casings and leaflets back to the police station for filing. It was found that the shop was opened by local residents Hou Zonglin and others for more than ten years, with Hou serving as the manager. The business has been very prosperous.</p>
<p>Shun Feng Shot At</p>
<p>Around 8:50 AM, Shun Feng Rice Mill at No. 103, the Changsha corner of Xinzha Road, was also very busy when two men in short clothes suddenly arrived. One of them pulled out a box gun and fired two shots into the shop. The shop assistants were shocked by the gunfire and ran to avoid it, causing chaos. Customers also fled in panic. Later, patrol officers arrived and found several leaflets. It was found that the rice mill was jointly owned by Jin Yunsheng and others from Jiangyin. After the three related cases occurred, the police paid close attention to them and immediately ordered strict protection of all rice shops within the concession to prevent similar incidents from happening again. It is understood that the leaflets distributed at the three locations were identical and contained warnings.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Shipping News) Education Minister Chen spoke at the Anti-Japanese Construction Hall on the afternoon of November 12th at the invitation of the Central Cultural Movement Committee. More than a thousand people attended, and Vice Minister Pan presided. Chen's topic was "Chinese Cultural Construction," and the gist of his speech was that future Chinese cultural construction movements should focus on three points: "Restoring national self-confidence, neither belittling ourselves nor blindly exaggerating ourselves; the psychology of construction should be based on the old morality, that is, propriety, justice, integrity, and shame; the strength of the organization must be sound, and the will must be concentrated to exert strength." He continued, "The cultural movement requires all types of cultural workers to promote it. The title of cultural person can only be given to those who are committed to practical work. If you want to win the war and build the country, you must rely on a firm will. The word 'must' is the greatest expression of will." Chen concluded his speech by giving the two "must" words of "must win the war and must build the country" to cultural workers. Vice Minister Qian delivered a speech, putting forward the two words "education and service" to encourage the intellectual class to work hard to eliminate illiteracy.</p>

<p>In the Middle School Basketball and Volleyball League, there will be four volleyball games and three basketball games at the Guoqiang Middle School starting at 8:00 AM today. The men's and women's volleyball championships have already been produced. The last four games today will not affect the overall situation. The competition is now over. The basketball game will start at 12:30 PM. The organizers have specially agreed with Qian Xucang, the founder of round door ball, to add a round door ball performance trial after the basketball game. Lan Bai will face Nanyang. Bai is one of the three strongest Chinese basketball teams. Famous players such as Bao Songyuan, Li Zude, Wang Nanqun, and Chen Bangzhen are all among the best. Nanyang is a strong team in both football and basketball. Players such as Zhang Banglun, Han Longhai, and Li Yao are not only skilled in basketball but also famous in Shanghai for football. Therefore, they will surely perform well in round door ball, which uses both football and basketball skills. Tickets will still be sold at five jiao each. A notice from the Nanyang team states that team members are expected to gather at Guoqiang Middle School before 2:00 PM.

<h3 id="e59">Cotton Yarn Greatly Declines; Slightly Hovering Before Hitting the Limit Down Again <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market still hasn't escaped its state of weakness. This is because a peaceful atmosphere pervades the market, and simultaneously, gold prices are weak, leading to softened sentiment. Short sellers have become active again. The opening price for 20-count Shuang Ma (Double Horse) factory yarn reflected the situation in the yarn and cloth exchange the previous afternoon, uniformly rising. The market price was better, with the initial price at 2,700 yuan. It briefly rose to 2,710 yuan. After this price hovered slightly, selling pressure suddenly intensified, and the number of available contracts felt increasingly loose. The market plunged to 2,630 yuan and then hit the limit down again. Off-exchange grey market trading reached as low as 2,590 yuan. Subsequently, the second session in the exchange rebounded, boosting confidence slightly, rising back to 2,655 yuan. The final price weakened slightly to 2,630 yuan. It is estimated that about 2,800 bales were traded in the half-day.</p>
<p>The Jin Shuang Ma futures market, due to the weekend, only had a half-day of trading as usual. The market sentiment continued the mixed trends of the previous day, and the trend remained unstable. At the opening in the morning, factory orders were initially weak, and coupled with the decline in the gold market, yarn futures sentiment was uneasy. Gold firms and securities houses were selling actively. The December contract opened at 2,600 yuan. Although it briefly rose to 2,615 yuan, it suddenly fell to a low of 2,500 yuan due to aggressive selling by both bulls and bears, and factory orders hit the limit down. Bulls lacked the strength to support the market. Therefore, the January contract opened at the lowest price of 2,550 yuan, and the February contract also fell by a small 70 yuan, opening at 2,670 yuan. Afterwards, prices fluctuated, and the various month contracts were quite uneven. Towards the close, many bought in to avoid the risk of holding positions over the weekend, and the trend became relatively firm. The near-term contract closed at 2,570 yuan, up only a small 30 yuan. The January contract rose to 2,630 yuan, a small increase of 40 yuan. The February contract closed at 2,680 yuan, also down by as much as 60 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon. The table is listed below:</p>
<p>December January February</p>
<p>Opening 2600.0 2550.0 2670.0</p>
<p>Highest 2625.0 2655.0 2705.0</p>
<p>Lowest 2500.0 2550.0 2660.0</p>
<p>Closing 257.00 2630.0 2680.0</p>
<p>Change Down 30.0 Down 40.0 Down 60.0</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Seems to be Waiting for Something</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains stagnant. Due to the weak yarn market and mediocre sentiment, transaction volumes have greatly decreased. Most are temporarily pausing to observe the situation before making a final decision.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is volatile and quite mixed. It initially rose due to buying in New Orleans, then fell due to selling by spot traders, and finally weakened further due to hedging by Southern traders and the liquidation of long positions. Yesterday's closing prices, compared to the previous day, were down about 4-5 points, except for October, which rose 9 points.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially saw active gains due to aggressive speculation. However, subsequently, it fell slightly due to some profit-taking and selling by professional traders. As a result, yesterday's closing prices were up by 5-6 rupees. It is predicted that the market will open lower by half a rupee today due to the stagnant movement of American cotton.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Four Thousand Pounds Sterling Unsought; US Dollars Finally at Thirty Yuan <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no changes in the rates quoted by the Central Bank and HSBC. The rates at HSBC and other smaller counters were also flat. The black market for Sterling and US Dollars was even more stagnant. Sterling was at 25.25, and a certain Chinese merchant broker had three to four thousand pounds sterling he couldn't sell. US Dollars were at 3.375, and it wasn't certain they could be sold. It was said that a sugar import firm was seeking to settle, making it tighter than the previous day. HSBC Bank bought US$3,000 of four-month telegraphic transfers at a price of 5.40625 yuan, resold through a broker commissioned by an export firm. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw both British and American gold pounds fall by ten yuan each. British gold notes continued to fall slightly by one yuan. American gold notes were about to break through the 30 yuan mark, with the final price at 30 yuan, still lower by 5 jiao than the previous day. Hong Kong notes rebounded by 1 jiao. Japanese gold notes and Korean notes continued to weaken, with the former falling to 3 yuan and the latter dropping to 3.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd (Saturday) Telegraph. The exchange market opened steadily this morning. The exchange rates still has no change. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin, 22nd (Saturday) Telegraph. The exchange market opened flat this morning. London and New York telegraphic transfers remained at their original levels, with rates quoted but no actual trading. Shanghai exchange rose by two yuan to seventy-four yuan. Joint Reserve Bank notes were cheaper by three and a half yuan, at forty-nine yuan and five jiao.</p>
<p>Large Buyers and Sellers in Confrontation; Gold Prices Fluctuating; Tongkangzhuang Joins the Money Exchange Reserve</p>
<p>Yesterday's cash market was particularly active. It happened to be Saturday, with business only open for one hour and thirty minutes from 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM. Market trends turned volatile and uncertain, initially rising, then plummeting, and then slightly rebounding. Prices re-entered the 16,000 yuan range. Large buyers and sellers were in a confrontational situation. Xianghe offered 430 taels, Yifeng offered 320 taels, Shunyuan offered 210 taels, and Yongcheng offered 140 taels. Chengji bought in the most at 310 taels, followed by Tianyuan at 230 taels, Xiangxingyong at 170 taels, and Mingfeng, Wanfeng, remittance houses, and securities firms each buying over 100 taels. Therefore, the price rose to 16,600 yuan. It once sharply fell to 15,250 yuan (the lowest price this month). It soon rebounded, closing down a small 300 yuan. 8,220 taels were traded in half a day. Gold ornaments were down a small 30 yuan. Refined silver was nominally flat, but the grey market had already fallen to 16 yuan.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Fell by Another 300 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning opening at 9:00 AM, each bar (10 taels) was still at 16,100 yuan, the same as the closing price the previous night. Because there were no sellers, Xianghe bought in aggressively, pushing the price up 500 yuan to 16,600 yuan. Shortly after, selling pressure suddenly intensified. Xianghe, Yong, Shihe, Yifeng, Dingsheng, Ming, Gonghe, Decheng, and Shunyuan competed to sell. Xianghe stopped buying and sold even more aggressively. The market price rapidly declined, plummeting 1,350 yuan, breaking through the 16,000 yuan mark, and reaching a low of 15,250 yuan. Xiangxing suddenly came in to buy, and bank support also started to push up. Defu and Chengji also bought in aggressively, immediately pushing the price up 800 yuan to 16,050 yuan. Tianyuan, Xianghe, and Decheng sold, immediately suppressing the price by 600 yuan to 15,450 yuan. Mingfeng, Tianyuan, and remittance houses absorbed the selling, causing the price to rise again to 15,850 yuan. The midday closing was at 15,800 yuan, down another 300 yuan from the previous day. It has fallen for three consecutive days, for a total drop of 3,730 yuan. After the close, it fell to 15,700 yuan. There was a high-low range of 1,350 yuan in half a day. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Expansion of the Functions of the Exchange Stabilization Fund <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Jack</p>
<p>Since the freezing of funds, the Exchange Stabilization Fund has taken the opportunity to control the exchange market, and the Shanghai foreign exchange problem seems to no longer exist. This is because the Stabilization Fund has concentrated foreign exchange in the hands of authorized banks, prohibiting direct or indirect trading at other exchange rates in order to eliminate the black market. It also directly restricts the import of foreign goods and indirectly restricts the supply of foreign exchange, reducing the quantity of imports in order to adjust trade. Although black market trading continues, the collection of export bills of exchange has not been achieved, and connected transactions cannot be prohibited, all three of which are undeniable. Even the A and B lists of standards for managed trade and foreign exchange supply have flaws. Therefore, I initially suggested cooperating with the United Kingdom and the United States to establish a licensing system, stipulating that imports are not allowed unless the foreign exchange earned is sold to authorized banks, in order to concentrate export bills of exchange and increase the fund. The A and B lists should be revised. Later, in view of the sharp contraction of the black market exchange rate, I strongly advocated establishing a strict clearing agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States to thoroughly control foreign exchange. The standards for foreign exchange supply should prioritize maintaining people's livelihoods, followed by national industries, and other sectors should have their supply ratios determined based on actual circumstances in order to strictly manage trade. The real solution to Shanghai's foreign exchange problem lies in how to collect export bills of exchange and how to prohibit connected transactions, which will naturally eliminate black market transactions. How to manage import trade and how to revise the standards for foreign exchange supply will consolidate the value of the legal currency.</p>
<p>Recently, economic envoys from China, the United Kingdom, and the United States gathered in Hong Kong, and the result was that the British and American governments simultaneously announced on the 12th of this month the revision of the regulations on the freezing of funds to China. From the information recently transmitted by telegraph, the specific content of the new measures is indeed a plan for strict foreign exchange control and trade management. Taking the United States as an example, under the new measures: The freezing of funds regulation of July 25, 1941, has been revised, and all Sino-US trade must be regulated by the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund. On the import side, before goods are exported, the US Customs authorities must review the supporting documents to see if they are processed in accordance with the various conditions set by the Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund. On the export side, before goods are shipped, the US Consul must be notified in advance by the authorized bank that the foreign exchange for the export has been sold before issuing a consular visa. Regarding remittances to China, new licenses have been issued. Except for the three northeastern provinces, any amount of remittance—US dollars stored in Chinese frozen accounts and non-frozen accounts—can be freely remitted to various parts of China, but the US dollars obtained from this remittance must be controlled by the Exchange Stabilization Fund for allocation at any time. For the United Kingdom—including other parts of the British Empire—whether importing from China or exporting to China, payments can only be made under the condition that they are handled by an authorized bank in accordance with the exchange rate set by the Exchange Stabilization Fund. As for the authorized banks: The four government banks of China: Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China. The fourteen foreign banks: American Express, Chase Bank, Citibank, AIG, Moscow Narodny Bank, Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger, Credit Lyonnais, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Mercantile Bank, Old Sassoon, New Sassoon, Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij, and Hollandsche Bank-Unie. The eight Chinese commercial banks: Guangdong Bank, China State Bank, Bank of East Asia, Overseas Chinese Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Xingye Bank, Jincheng Bank, and Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank.</p>
<p>Examining these measures in detail, their function is no different from a clearing agreement. All goods exported from China, regardless of the port of export or the nationality of the exporting merchant, must sell their foreign exchange to an authorized bank, and remittances from overseas Chinese must also be paid through an authorized bank. In this way, China's international income, whether from trade or finance, will be included in the fund's account and cannot flow into the black market. Without supply, black market transactions will naturally be eliminated. With foreign exchange supply returned to the fund, the fund can be increased at any time, and the allocation of foreign exchange for imports does not have to rely entirely on the original fund. As the fund increases at any time, when supplying foreign exchange for imports, the extent of the fund’s reserve can be considered when determining the amount allocated. Thus, China’s control of foreign exchange will be thoroughly resolved. In short, the expansion of the Exchange Stabilization Fund's functions this time is entirely due to the goodwill cooperation of the British and American governments. It is urgently hoped that the fund will actively formulate steps to promote this function, with the simplest procedures and greatest effort, to achieve the goals of Sino-US-UK cooperation.</p>
<p>Refined Silver Holders Come Out</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments per tael quoted by the Datongxing and Xintongxing initially increased by 60 yuan to 1,700 yuan. It then saw a small decrease, falling 120 yuan to 1,580 yuan. At noon, it rebounded to 1,630 yuan. In the afternoon, it decreased again to 1,610 yuan, down a small 30 yuan. The buying price has been reduced by 150 yuan. However, since yesterday's buying price per tael was only 1,400 yuan, it must be reduced by 210 yuan. Refined silver is still quoted at 24 yuan, but holders in the black market have come out, falling to 16 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee issued a circular to all banks yesterday, stating that Tongkangzhuang had joined the Money Exchange Reserve as a member from the 19th of this month. Afterwards, when various banks receive payment instruments from Tongkangzhuang, they should entrust the Committee for collection and handle it in the same way as other member firms.</p>
<p>Optimistic Prospects for Public Bonds</p>
<p>The grey market for public bonds was relatively stable yesterday. Because it was Saturday, trading was relatively slow, and sentiment was also cautious. Bulls were still tightly closed, unwilling to let go easily. Most people believe that the US-Japan talks the next day will be more likely to approach an agreement. Although the future results cannot be predicted, previous serious situations should be slightly eased. The sharp decline in coupon bonds has caused gold to lose its luster, which may be a sign of a good phenomenon. The market for C-type public bonds has not yet entered the right track. However, a few speculators and general retail investors are taking advantage of the opportunity to promote each other. After it enters the right track in the future, it will surely soar and recover its previous high price, which should not be difficult. Yesterday, as it was Saturday, the market opened at 11:00 AM and closed in the afternoon. After opening, there were still more buyers than sellers. The opening price for C-type bonds was 4 jiao higher. Yitai, Tongyi, Hongda, and retail investors bought in the market, supplied by Lemaorunde, Shuntai, etc. The price fluctuated around 70 yuan. As a result, the market price uniformly improved by 1 to 5 jiao. The total amount transacted was approximately 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 77.40 76.50 76.90 Up 0.50</p>
<p>Unified B 72.40 72.15 72.40 Also Up 0.40</p>
<p>Unified C 70.80 70.10 70.40 Also Up 0.40</p>
<p>Unified D 67.20 67.10 67.10 Also Up 0.10</p>
<p>Unified E 70.30 69.90 Also Up 0.30</p>
<p>In stock trading, shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 95 yuan per share.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Rice Market Stable <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was still in a state of invisible suspension. Domestic rice was allocated to rice shops and consumers at 110 bags each, all delivered directly with permits. Kunshan new japonica rice was 193 yuan per bag (including bag) and 187 yuan (without bag). Bo rice was 181 yuan and 180 yuan, depending on the quality. The market was similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Amidst Price Controls on All Goods, Flour Prices Soar, Rising Ten Yuan in Three Days <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market changed again. Due to control measures, Western warehouse goods depreciated by 40 yuan, but there were still few buyers. However, each flour store in Pudong was guaranteed by a French company, and each shipping out of the country was led to motivate speculators and big customers to rise. The price of the "Golden Dragon" brand rose from 45 yuan to 48 yuan, and the "Fortress" brand reached 50 yuan, showing a rise of three to five yuan compared to the previous market. Large customers were making quick deals, and speculation was active. The market seems to be brewing further price increases. Amidst the suppression of rice prices and price controls on all goods, the flour price has soared by ten yuan in two or three days, which has attracted much attention from society.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Oil Beans Speculation Knows its Concerns <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil bean trend was weak, because the actual sales were still low. Speculators were concerned about government control and also had less willingness to enter. Therefore, market sentiment was soft. Edible oil prices fell by 5 yuan to 10 yuan. Soybeans also fell by 2-3 yuan. Broad beans were down about 1 yuan. Corn was initially weak but then firm, and ultimately reported a stable trend. The Unified Market offered 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 200 dan of Qingyou oil from Dayou Factory, 100 dan each of rapeseed oil from Yoshida and Yinan factories, 50 barrels of rapeseed oil from Rihua Factory, 400 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan, and over 100 packages of Qingdou, one car of Changzhou cattle hide yellow, 300 packages of Jiaozhou and Qingkou soybeans, 50 packages of Chongming sand silkworms, 600 packages of spot corn, and over 100 tons of corn futures.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Cotton Cloth Rises More Than Falls <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend was erratic. At the close, there was a slight improvement. White cloth, both coarse and fine twills, rose by 5 jiao to 1 yuan per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloth was flat. Transactions by both dealers and hoarders were scarce, due to the exploratory stage of US-Japan negotiations and cautious market sentiment. Butterfly coarse cloth initially opened at a low price of 92 yuan, and the price at the close of the afternoon rose to 98 yuan with price fluctuation of one yuan. The number of sales of various cloths in this street was over 200 pieces, and bleached and dyed cloths of Zhejiang and Fujian merchants was over 100 pieces.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Although yesterday's market saw both rises and falls, the situation had become firm and stable. The colorful ball futures cloths at the exchange fell by 1 yuan to 2.1 yuan each month. For the leading fine cloth factory orders in the spot market, the initial low price was quoted at 91.2 yuan, and it quickly rose to 97 yuan. The closing price was 96 yuan, down 1 yuan. However, fine twills were consistently raised by 2-3 yuan due to the lack of spot goods. The closing price of Four Gentlemen broadcloth new orders was 3 yuan 4 jiao 6 and a half fen, down 3 and a half fen.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Sugar Prices Decline <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for 24th grade coarse white sugar was still stalled due to restrictions, with no transactions at all. The limited price and actual sales were completely divergent. No one would be so foolish as to buy high-priced goods and lose their capital. The futures market for coarse sugar continued to decline. The 30th contract initially opened at 235 yuan, then 39 yuan, and then 33 yuan, a total drop of 15 yuan. The 10th contract of next month (Monday) can be opened.

<h3 id="e69">The Warning of Time <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Children; if you are not forgetful, you must remember the happy situation when school started, like your parents using their hard-earned money to pay for your tuition, enabling you to newly acquire a lot of spiritual food, - new books -. But time is the most ruthless. The fallen leaves of the plane tree tell you that early winter has arrived, and the end of the semester is not far in the future.</p>
<p>There are, of course, many diligent students, but there must be a few students who, perhaps because the coursework is difficult, embrace the principle of "whatever happens, happens"; or because they have become bored over time, they are no longer interested in the new books of a few weeks ago; or they postpone, thinking that the end of the semester is still one or two months away, so they play around for a while; thus, their grades deteriorate day by day, and the more they deteriorate, the less they try, resulting in "burning the midnight oil" when the end of the semester arrives, and even failing and repeating the grade, and being ridiculed by relatives and friends.</p>
<p>What a shameful and wasteful thing it is to spend your parents' hard-earned money! But, "never hesitate to correct mistakes," "diligence can compensate for clumsiness." Quickly start from today, and you must decide, from today, not tomorrow, to review your past grades and see if they are below standard. If the lessons you have been taught before seem "familiar but strange," then set aside some time in addition to reviewing today's lessons to review one or two old lessons. If you have any doubts, be sure to ask the teacher or outstanding students. Then you can still recover from your previous mistakes. Although you cannot immediately become the best, passing will not be a problem.</p>
<p>Children! Please pay special attention to the warning of time: - Plane tree leaves are falling, and early winter has arrived!</p>
<h3 id="e70">A Little Blacksmith <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The saying goes, "A good man doesn't become a soldier, and good iron isn't made into nails," viewing it as shameful for a good man to become a soldier and regrettable for good iron to be made into nails; but in this great era, these two sayings are no longer correct. "A good man must be a soldier" for the country to have a way out; "good iron must be made into nails" for buildings to be deeply rooted. Now let me write a story about a little blacksmith and dedicate it to the children.</p>
<p>The little blacksmith, Jin'er, was originally the son of a farmer. In the eleventh year of his life, he unfortunately suffered the calamity of the "August 13th" artillery fire, abandoned his books, tearfully bid farewell to his hometown, and followed his mother and brother, fleeing in a sorry state to Shanghai. On the way, he braved the flying bullets and endured all kinds of hardships. Unfortunately, his brother was killed by a stray bullet along the way. At this time, life was hanging by a thread, and he couldn't even care about his brother's body, but protected his strong mother, mustered his courage, and finally got them both to Shanghai. But with no relatives to turn to, who would provide them with food, clothing, and shelter? His mother came up with a way to make a living by working as a maid in a broker's shop. After a few days, she was hired as a domestic helper by the boss of a blacksmith shop. Of course, he followed her. At his mother's request, he was taken in as an apprentice and became a "little blacksmith" in practice. The strong character he developed in three years of training is one of being able to endure hunger, cold, and hard work, working tirelessly day and night. This little blacksmith has great ambitions. He asked his master to find a way to recommend him to work in the Great Rear Area. As a result, he achieved his goal. He is fifteen years old this year. What are your thoughts after reading this, children?</p>
<h3 id="e71">Tuberculosis Eradication Movement <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Niu Huiren</p>
<p>At a time when science is so advanced, there is still no reliable way to cure tuberculosis. Once you get this disease, you have to rest for the whole year, wasting your ambition to be a human being. Even more people run into the danger of death. This is a truly terrifying disease! In Shanghai, with a population of four million, it is estimated that at least 330,000 people are currently under its attack. Children, quickly stand up and participate in the tuberculosis eradication movement - to eliminate this invisible great enemy.</p>
<p>How can we participate in this movement? First, we should pay attention to our own health. Exercise more, pay more attention to hygiene, and have a detailed physical examination once every semester to avoid and prevent it from attacking. If you are unlucky enough to have been invaded by it, you should seek medical attention as soon as possible. If time is delayed, it will become a serious illness, which would be very dangerous.</p>
<p>Second, we must publicize it to society. Tuberculosis is a social disease, and when it is discovered in society, it is the misfortune of the entire society. Eliminating this great enemy of society is also protecting our own families. It can be seen that this movement must mobilize the strength of the entire society. Therefore, we must do our best to publicize to others, and deeply imprint the importance of the tuberculosis eradication movement into everyone's minds.</p>
<p>Third, support the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association's fundraising campaign. The purpose of their fundraising is to build a large-scale tuberculosis hospital to clear Shanghai's tuberculosis. Moreover, the fundraising expenses are all borne by the staff, without spending a penny of donations. This pure charitable spirit is admirable, so we must enthusiastically support it!</p>
<p>Quickly, let's quickly participate in the tuberculosis eradication movement.</p>

<p>A gust of west wind,</p>

<p>The yellow leaves rustle on the ground,</p>

<p>Are they complaining about the west wind?</p>
<p>Or are they making a final struggle?</p>
<p>Blame themselves:</p>
<p>The leaves are too soft, the petioles too weak,</p>
<p>Unable to endure hardship, unable to withstand the cold,</p>
<p>Unable to stand upright on the branches, and fight</p>
<p>the wind and meat.</p>
<p>A gust of west wind,</p>

<h3 id="e73">Get Up Early with Determination <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>The air is fresh in the morning, and the environment is quiet, so getting up early to exercise can strengthen the muscles and bones. Reviewing lessons is also easier to remember. Children, you have probably already heard these words from your teachers, and they must have taught you to get up early, right?</p>
<p>Of course, the children who like to learn will follow the teachers' words and develop the habit of getting up early. However, the lazy children still huddle in their blankets and refuse to get up early when it's cold. This is because they lack determination.</p>
<p>No matter what we do, we must have a strong will, a calm determination, and a persistent spirit to achieve success. Getting up early is the same. We must be resolute and decisive to develop a habit.</p>
<p>Getting up early has many benefits for children. From today onwards, those who already get up early should be extra persistent and get up early every day. Those who usually sleep late should make a decision and get up early every day. Get up and be a little warrior to fight the cold wind, instead of hiding in the blanket and being a lazy worm.</p>
<p>Children are the masters of the country, and they should have the determination and spirit to develop good habits from an early age, so that they can take on great responsibilities in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Be Careful of Woolen Sweaters <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, and the weather is gradually getting colder. Children, haven't the clothes you wear become thicker too? A child in my neighborhood, yesterday evening, was wearing a knitted woolen sweater when a stranger suddenly approached him at the street corner and said, "Little brother, do you want to go over there to buy candy?" He said, "No, my mom is looking for me." "Then take off your woolen sweater and give it to me!" the stranger said, and proceeded to take off his clothes. The child was very scared and started crying. The man saw him crying, took out a shiny small knife from his pocket, and shouted, "Don't cry, or I'll cut your fingers!" The child didn't dare to cry anymore, and watched as his clothes were snatched away.</p>
<p>Children! Many of you wear woolen sweaters, don't you? After hearing this news, what do you think! I hope that from now on, you will study hard at home and no longer wander outside, so that you will not suffer the same fate as the child above.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Clothes (Part 2) <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>His mother was even sorting out the jacket that A-Liang had worn last year. Because it had been washed and dried so many times, the color had turned somewhat whitish, making it quite unsightly. His father stood by and watched, thinking that A-Liang would definitely ask questions again, so he said to him first: "Look, why has the color of your jacket changed?"</p>
<p>"Is it because it's been washed and dried so much?" A-Liang said with a smile, indicating his cleverness.</p>
<p>"Why does washing and drying clothes a lot cause them to change color?" his father asked, immediately causing A-Liang to lose his smile and stare blankly, unable to answer.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll tell you. Clothes come in all sorts of colors, all dyed with dyes of various colors. You have to know that dye is a very complex chemical. When many dyes are exposed to sunlight for a long time, they will turn into other compounds. If the original color is blue, if it changes, the color of the newly formed compound will be different, or it will become white or other colors. So, it's not good to expose dyed clothes to the sun too much! Also, washing clothes with hot water is cleaner than washing them with cold water. This is because the dirt on clothes is mostly grease or dust, which is tightly stuck to the clothes. Washing with hot water can soften grease and other dirt, preventing it from sticking to the clothes again, so it can be washed clean. Cold water doesn't have this ability. If you don't believe me, you can ask your mother if what I'm saying is wrong?" A-Liang's father impatiently said all of this. Of course, A-Liang believed what his father said. Besides, if his father was wrong, his mother would also help him, right? This was A-Liang's silent thought, which he dared not say aloud. But what his father said was mostly right!</p>

<h3 id="e76">Performing Shanghai's New Spoken Drama <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>How to Change the Goal of Speculators and Hoarders from Their Failures and Despair to Suicide to a Great Undertaking that Benefits the Country</p>
<p>"Soldiers in the interior are shedding blood and sweat, enduring hunger to fight on the front lines; people in the interior are displaced; but the people of Shanghai are still indulging in extravagance and boundless licentiousness." Some hoard goods, some speculate in transactions, and some are immersed in money and pleasure. There are many spoken dramas that depict this decadent life, such as Xu Qu's "Business Sutra," Bao Lei's "Gold Rush," and Xia Yan's "City of Sorrow." But the results all depict speculators and hoarders failing to the point of suicide, or at least despair. The attitudes of these three authors are the same: depiction, satire, and even condemnation. Originally, these people could only be viewed in this way.</p>
<p>However, Gu Zhongyi's "Isolated Island Men and Women," which was recently performed at the Xuan Palace, is different from the three plays mentioned above. The author has a heart full of hope and pity. The author adopts the attitude of an educator, feeling that a person does bad things, not necessarily all out of his own will, but with external enticements, such as making bad friends. Many privately run businesses in our country are also national strength. If these people can be turned to do undertakings that benefit the country, such as investing in mining in the interior, it may not be a bad thing. Therefore, the author does not have the protagonist Zhang Jingshan commit suicide due to failure. Although it was not continued, judging from Jingshan's strict discipline of his children after his speculation failed, not allowing them to dance, gamble, or watch money, he himself will also realize and go to the interior with his promising younger brother Zhenshan.</p>
<p>In the second act, the author has already stated the pain that Jingshan feels about speculation: "Doing this kind of business always feels like a stone is pressing on my heart, making me uneasy day and night. During the day, I just want to make a phone call to ask about market news, and at night I can't even sleep. I feel that this kind of business with mental pain is too meaningless." In the third act, Jingshan said again: "I don't want to do this kind of speculative business at all. I feel extremely tired. I live under tense emotions all day long. The ups and downs of market prices are like cold water being poured on the heart of a speculator, and sometimes like fire burning there. Your heart is hot for a while and cold for a while. No one who is not strong can endure this kind of bloodless torture."</p>
<p>These two paragraphs, on the one hand, show that Jingshan will have a change, and on the other hand, they are also the author's painstaking efforts, deeply expressing the pain of speculation and warning others not to do it again. Whether all speculators and hoarders will realize this is another question, but we cannot be without this hope.</p>
<p>Therefore, although this subject has already been written by several writers, "Isolated Island Men and Women" is still worth seeing because it is a new realm that no one has ever thought of.</p>
<h3 id="e77">A Record of the Jiyou Association's Public Performance <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the female colleagues of the Jiyou Association of the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Post Office performed the spoken drama "Women's Apartment" at the Lyceum Theatre, donating all the ticket sales, excluding expenses, to the YWCA's operating expenses. There were two performances, day and night, both of which were sold out. The lineup for this performance was quite strong, including Jin Jiazhen, Lu Weihua, He Sujun, Mu Yuexia, Tang Peijin, Ding Wenqin, Yang Yadan, Chen Zhitong, Hu Dao, Li Song, Wang Liankui, plus the old brand "Austin" Tian Taixuan's old nanny. It can truly be said to be a perfect match. During the performance, the general audience watched very attentively. When the fourth act, Zhao Songyun, trained her daughter and met her husband, the audience felt mournful and sad, and the female audience members were all tearful. Miss Ding's acting skills can be said to be extremely successful.</p>

<p>Bette Davis's latest masterpiece, "The Little Foxes," has been showing at the Majestic Theatre since a few days ago. The story is about a woman who is obsessed with money and disregards the love of her husband and daughter. Bette Davis's performance is delicate and realistic. This film is adapted from the stage play by the great female writer Lillian Hellman. Supporting actors include Herbert Marshall and Teresa Wright, who is a stage star. This is her first time on the screen, and her performance is very outstanding. This film has been a great success since its release. People in Shanghai, don't miss it.</p>

<p>The famous actress Huang Guiqiu of the New Stage will perform her representative work "Qiu Xiang's Three Smiles" tomorrow night. Last year, Guiqiu also performed this play on the same stage. On the last day, she performed two performances, day and night, both of which were full houses.</p>
<p>The Communist Stage is rehearsing five new plays by Ouyang De starting tonight. It was rumored that Wang Hongfu had been invited to play Peng Gong, but this is not accurate.</p>
<p>Li Shaochun, a new star of the Tianchan Stage, has arrived in Shanghai and is scheduled to take the stage on the 28th. He has scheduled three days of "bubble plays," which are *Zhan Taiping*, *Shui Lian Dong*, and *Da Gu Ma Cao*. Two generals will appear in the same performance. Gu Zhuxuan, the owner of the stage, hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant last night for Qin Kunshan, the owner of the Hongchun Troupe, to sign a contract, because the stage has already invited the Hongchun Troupe.</p>
<p>The new star of the Golden Grand Theatre, Xi Xiaobo, and Hou Yulan have still not arrived in Shanghai as of yesterday, arriving late, which is very disappointing.</p>
<p>The Grand Theatre has invited the martial arts actor Wang Yingwu to perform in the thirteenth episode of *Divine and Strange Swordsman Biography*, playing the role of Wang Xi.</p>
<p>Brief News: The Huayi Drama Society will hold its second public performance of the famous morality play "Success in the Imperial Examinations" starting from today's daytime performance. The performance on the third day (the 25th) is to raise funds for Yangzheng Primary School. The consultants for the play are Yang Xiaozhong and Hu Feng. The society has recently found a new location and continues to recruit members.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: At Dusk, the Nomad Cavalry Fill the City with Dust</p>
<p>Li Zicheng and the others were about to encircle and annihilate the Ming army led by Wu Sangui, but unexpectedly, another large army arrived, leaving them confused for a moment. After the rebel bandits made contact, they saw that the soldiers who had come were all braided on their heads. They realized that they were Qing soldiers and exclaimed in surprise, "The Manchurian soldiers are here!" The iron cavalry charged, and the formation wavered. Wu Sangui and his subordinates, such as Zhang Cangqiu and Chai Ying, also fought desperately in the encirclement, creating a counter-encirclement situation against the rebel bandits. The rebel bandits had heard of the Qing army's name and were facing such a fierce enemy for the first time, so they collapsed and trampled on each other, killing countless people. Li Zicheng was greatly shocked and fled first with Niu Jinxing and others. The Ming soldiers and Qing army then attacked them from behind, inflicting heavy losses on the rebel bandits. Li Zicheng fled to Yongping, losing 150,000 to 160,000 soldiers. This bloody battle was extremely fierce. It was the first time that the rebel bandits had encountered such a powerful enemy. They originally thought they could directly attack the Shanhaiguan Pass and wipe out Wu Sangui's Ming army along the way. How could they have known that Sangui had already invited the Qing army to enter the pass, and they themselves had suffered unprecedentedly? Wu Sangui was naturally overjoyed to have defeated the rebel bandits. Zhang Cangqiu and others fought hard in the bloody battle, killing many more bandits. They were also happy that none of them had suffered serious injuries, except for Chen Fei, who had a slight injury to his leg. Wu Sangui and Dorgon met and congratulated each other on their military achievements. Sangui also expressed his gratitude by offering wine and meat to comfort the Qing army. Dorgon also gave leather goods from outside the pass to Sangui and his generals. He also ordered Wu Sangui to lead the cavalry and infantry to pursue the bandits and capture Yanjing as soon as possible. With the Qing army as his backing, and after winning a battle, Sangui's courage was even greater. (226)</p>
