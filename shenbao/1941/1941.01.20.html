<p>社評</p>
<h3>祝羅斯福氏三任總統就職</h3>
<p>美總統羅斯福氏於去冬膺選三度聯任後，將於本日在國會宣誓就職。這一打破美國歷史慣例的典禮，適在國際局勢極度動盪之際舉行，吾人除爲美國深表慶祝而外，更感到無上快慰；深信羅總統必能在此後四年任期之中，愈益發抒其抱負，爲世界與人類完成其偉大的不朽任務。</p>
<p>照美國的成例，從大選舉行到總統就職。其間有兩個半月的距離，這在平時原不過只是新舊交替中的一個短短過程，毫無意義可言；而在侵略與反侵略肉搏決鬥的今日，則適成爲雙方所必爭的時間對象。去年冬初，三個同盟國家所準備的冬季攻勢，也就是針對着美方總統更迭而佈置的。然而由於美國人民善於運用理智辨明利害的結果，並未因大選而給予侵略國家這樣一個可乘的間隙。反之，美政府到因爲羅氏再度膺選而益得進一步積極發揮其固定政策；有如對中國的一萬萬元貸款與對英希的擴大支援，增加菲島與太平洋各處的防禦設備，二洋海軍的獨立建築，羅總統譴責侵略罪行的爐邊談話與國會咨文，允其是最近租借戰具案的提出與討論，都在此一期間中有如連珠砲般向着侵略者繼續發射，使侵略國家感到空前支絀與不利。如同法國與西班牙之拒絕參加軸心，英希在地中海兩岸的大勝，日本南進之欲進又止，舉棋不定，直接間接都是受美方對外堅決政策的影響。而這却又都是美國最大多數選民擁護羅氏連任所發揮的效果。固然，假若此度共和黨獲勝，其未來措施固未必竟與美政府現行政策大相逕庭，這於連日威爾基之力排衆議，擁護羅氏支援中英提案，尤足徵賢者所見相同。但是羅氏假若落選，則至少在這交替的兩個半月之間，不只無以戢止侵略者的冒險嘗試，就連美國自身的若干國防程序和對外措置，怕也會格於中樞更迭而感到進行棘手吧。一九三二年尾的日軍突行進攻楡關熱河，就是利用美國元首遞嬗的機會；假若此决乃爲歷史的重演，其變亂當更非日本之佔領熱河冀東所可比擬。今日種種，固然是羅斯福的成功，同時也更是民主政治的成功。</p>
<p>羅氏的物望與抱負，已於去冬大選當中經過一决普遍而嚴格的測驗；雖然其間存在着歷史慣例的限制，敵黨分子的抨擊，與夫第五縱隊的破壞，却絕不因而减低美人對於羅氏的擁護愛戴，終於戰勝了他的政敵；且事實上，不但在美國，即在並世各國人材當中，羅氏亦是傑出的偉大領袖。然而羅氏雖已獲有這些成功，其在施政運用過程中，却尙不足以打銷少數孤立份子所固執的立塲：連日美國會關於援助法案的討論，正因此陷於激烈爭辯。彼輩那種抱殘守缺的精神，固可證明民治制度下每個人都有充分發揮他主張的機會，但在一個危疑震撼之秋，過分執着於個人的偏見，勢必致窒礙重大任務的順利遂行。就最近關於那一法案討論經過看，其終得通過，大體可無問題，所爭執者只在總統執行的權限與應用的範圍，而連日赫爾與史汀生諾克斯的連袂出席，大聲疾呼，幾乎動員了美國中樞的全部陣容，甚至連羅總統本身也得間接的從事於辯護；這是少數分子所逼成的不必要的浪費，即此所浪費的時間，也就不免阻礙了政府在這一時間內各種措施的進展。本報昨日社評已指出軸心國在美國援助法案成立以前發動攻勢的可能；自該法案提交國會，爭辯已歷旬日，像這樣一個重大國策程序，固不應過涉輕率，旬日亦未謂甚久，但平心而論民治精神又豈繫於少數分子所作不必要的頑固？吾人希望美國國會於舉世喁喁屬望之際，勿再蹈聚訟盈庭貽誤事機的愆尤；更復切盼美國人民能以前此打破歷史傳統的精神，打破種種頑梗的成見；舉凡限制總統權限的建議，單獨支援英國的主張，對於戰爭的恐怖，出讓軍艦的阻撓，都適與多數美國人民擁護羅氏的初衷相違反，絕不應任其梗阻當局偉大政策的遂行。</p>
<p>現在遠東與歐洲都正孕育着新的動亂，這將要是羅總統就職後首先遭遇着的課題；他高瞻遠矚，目光如炬，意其必能發揮無比偉力，繼續和擴大前此數月間業已開始了的端緒；俾使正義獲伸，暴行匿跡。據稱羅總統目前體况與健康都較前此益稱佳良，這是全世界人類的福音，也是正義安髯與秩序的福音！</p>

<p>控制海洋　保障安全</p>
<p>以遵守法國家、按制公海、實爲目前世界局勢下、使西半球獲得安全之道、設公海由彼三國同盟之簽字國控制、則其對我國之危險、將較今日大逾數倍、人們常云、新世界決無侵略之危險、並云、德人且不能渡英偷海峽、何能渡大西洋、設無目下配備精良之英國、於每日之任何一個時間、均在從事戰爭以阻止德國渡英倫海峽、設英國無精密之防御計劃以抵禦德人之登陸、恐德人於一小時內即可渡英倫海峽焉須知此歐洲大陸與英國間之二十　廣闊水面、乃係由英人控制、而非由德人控制、設英國戰敗、設英國喪失海洋之控制力、則除非吾人能爲英國現時所爲者、德國即可渡大西洋、尤其南大西洋、設大西洋被德國控制、則大西洋即不能供給安余之保障矣、在此種情勢之下、欲保障吾人全國之安全、將需吾人極大部分之工作及財富、以供國防生產、延長普遍軍役、實施極度負担之租稅、在吾人邊境、從事片刻不停之戒備以防敵人、並將完全牽入於權力外交、設情勢若是、以上所述種種、便成爲必須、今日之英國、乃一眞正之堡壘、而當美國之武裝防禦準備完成、美國亦將若是、然事實上、似理想上之侵略者、或不能採用直接之前面攻擊、以征服美國、設若輩有侵略機會可乘、吾人敢料、彼侵略者、必第一步侵略西半球其他較美國易受攻擊之各國、然後侵美、破壞勢力、現在許多美洲國家、從事苦幹、以圖製造國際之紛爭及破裂、此種行動、人們今已熟諗爲武裝侵略之前奏、現此等勢力、已在遭受制裁、並被積極剷除中、然若公海之控制權落於理想攻擊者之手中、則全般局勢、便將改變、在此種情勢之下、因大陸防禦之因難、吾人所費之力、恐較此時吾人所欲用者更爲巨大矣、美國今日之最嚴重問題、厥爲美國是吾任令公海之控制權、　於只圖無限制征服之國家之手中、職是之故、吾人今日便應糾正關於準備供英物質援助問題所抱之觀念及行動、</p>
<p>物質援助　被侵國家</p>
<p>公共政策問題、在今日最　得本國民衆之一致與重視者、無過於爲吾人自己之最重要利害關係、而必須於最短之期間內給與英國及其他受侵略者以最大之物質上援助之問題、其所以然者、蓋與抵抗侵略者以該項援助、乃吾人自衛之最重要部份、現已完全明顯矣、在侵略武力正橫行世界之時、吾人欲決定聰明審愼之國策則必須考慮自衛、吾人若不與受侵略者以援助、結果必不能恢復和平、僅是使已受侵略之國家永久淪爲奴隸、而給與使略者得集合力量以攻擊吾人之機會而已、吾人現今以自衛之工具與之對抗之軍隊、其領袖已根本廢棄由來已久之和平有序的國際關係、彼等已不顧中立國之一切權利、即彼等已親自莊嚴保證其不受侵犯之權利、亦置諸不顧、彼等所常用以統治其不幸之犧牲者之利器、乃無理的恐怖殺戮。欺詐·强制工役、沒收財產集中營及其他各剝削而已、現今和平的國家對於法律觀念保障、有許多自信存心善良奉法唯謹之國家已被毀滅矣、吾肯定將來必有一日到臨、凡自己藐視不顧法律秩序之原則之國家、必無機會要求其欲加害之國家、嚴格地遵守該項原則、直至兵臨城下而後已、但此種國家一日存在、則吾必須不受其恐嚇或抗議、而致變更吾人之決心、隨時創造各種自身安全所必需之自衛方法及條件、目前之法案、將設立一機構、使吾人能最有效的使用吾人富源、以供吾人自身之需要及吾人爲自衛而決定與以援助者之需要、民主制度之最大問題、乃在從速完全組織、並運用共力量、現今提出之法案、乃達此目的之必要方法、此法案可使吾人能用最善之計算之方法分配吾人之富源、以期美國及美洲在吾人將臨之多方危險狀况中獲得安全、最重要者乃使吾人能用最快之方法、完成各事、迅速二字、乃吾人今日最切要者、</p>
<p>引用條約　答覆詢問</p>
<p>在陳術完畢後、有人向赫爾詢問該法案對於本國法及國際法之影饗如何？赫爾即引用各種條的及法律答覆如下（一）瓊森法、此法似將不受影響、因該法不適用於美國政府、或依據國會特別授權而設立之公法人、或美政府擁有行使重要利害之公司例如進出口銀行、（二）一九三九年之公立法、該法第七節、禁止對交戰國放款或信用、但依其文義對美政府不能適用對於進出口銀行等類之公司、則可適用、然無論如何、有關於美國政府之行爲、此項規定、將爲新法所代替、（二）聯邦法典第十八章第二十三節、禁止船隻在美國配置武裝、以供交戰國用以對抗一與美國無戰爭關係之國家或民族、該法第二十四節禁止交戰國之軍艦或武裝船隻在美國港口增加或建設武力、該法第三十三節禁止在美國尙守中立之戰爭中遺出任何軍用船隻至國外交給戰國、上述各項規定、將爲新法所代替、一九〇七年海牙公約、一九〇七年第十三决海牙公約、在第六條規定、禁止中立國直接或間接以任何方法供給交戰國軍艦、軍械或軍用原料、第十七條規定、交戰國軍艦得在中立港口爲航行能力所必需之修理、但不能以任何方法增加戰鬥力量、第十八條規定、交戰國軍艦不得利用中立港口補充或增加其軍用原料或武器、此公約不能適用於此决歐戰、因第二十八條規定、「除交戰國俱係曾參加本公約者外、本公約不適用、英國及義大利並未參加該公約、或謂聯邦法典及上述所引用之海牙公約、乃申述國際公法關於上頃問題之原則、吾人若爲新法所想像之各事、則將破壞中立、此種見解在普通情形之下、大致確當、但吾人所處理者、非一普通情勢、吾人實已面臨一非常情勢矣、</p>
<p>中立觀念　徒鑄大錯</p>
<p>關於中立國之權利與義務之規則、及關於交戰國之權利與義務之規則、乃互相對待者、即所謂交戰國不得從事某種侵害中立國權利之事、而中立國亦不得爲某種妨害交戰國權利之事、例如海牙公約第一條規定、交戰國必須尊露中立國之主權、並於中立國領土或領水內、不得從事任何足以構成侵犯中立之行爲、又交戰國亦不得使用中立海港及領水作爲與敵人交戰之軍艦及潛艇之根據地、（第五條）、德、義兩國並不注意此等足爲國際法代表之種種規定、且不經通知、任意以武力佔領中立各國之領土、而旣經征服此等國家以後又復利用此等被征服之資源以攻擊敵對之國、此等國家中之一國、例如比利時、於一九三九年五月一日、曾與德國訂立一正式條約雙方同意、於任何事件決不訴諸武力、其决如挪威、於一九三九年九月一日、曾獲得德政府之保證、該項保證、係謂德國決不干犯挪威之不可侵犯權及政治完整、又謂德國決尊重挪威之領土完整、此種協定或中立法規、均不能作挪威、比利時及其他國家之保障、而反供交戰國以侵佔其土地之便利、除武力外、竟未見有其他方法足以制止此等交戰國家以侵略手段征服他國之心、此等交戰國所具征服世界之目的、業已大膽宜布、若輩業已承認若辈之哲學、係與民主國家之哲學相反、並堅强認民治主義已經陳舊、而須由若輩起而遂其組織國際關係之要求、吾人心中已覺某種事實已經發生、且在繼統發生、且在吾人眼前繼續發生吾人若再以中立法規爲準據、或感覺中立法可給與吾人以最低限度之安全或保障、是乃徒費心機之舉、唯有注意現行局勢之實際觀念、方爲一穩健之觀念、故中立問題、余已設明、於一旦受有野心侵略者之障礙、便成爲幻影、除中立問題外、有一公認之原則、較任何中立法規爲陳舊、是即一國防禦內外威脅之自衛權、此乃一國主權之要素、而亦爲凱洛哥白里安公約簽字各國所確認者也、吾人容或可得知此等侵略者無意侵犯西半球、但若干被若輩以武力佔領之國家、均曾經侵略者、給予保證、此種保證、均爲空言、以是吾人、非至能確定此等侵略者實際所存之心理爲何、吾人決不能依賴此種保證而遲延吾國國防之完成、若干被征服國家、及其他未被征服之各國、在西半球均有屬地、吾人是吾應設想設事勢許可、此等屬地能不被彼侵略國佔領耶、能不被彼侵略國用作根據地以完成其征服世界之企圖耶、吾人業已充分認識、以軍需供給若干直接正在自衛、而間接亦在保衛吾人以反抗具有武力征服他國決心者之侵入之國家、實屬正當、吾人現僅企圖保衛吾人以反抗一種非爲吾人所建設之局勢、吾人之所以竭智盡力者、即爲防止此種局勢之發生耳、（合衆社）</p>

<h3>日本侵華戰爭　支付重大代價　海外貿易一蹶不振　黃金外流國庫枯竭</h3>
<p>華盛頓　據中立派經濟學家及國際問題專家語合衆社記者、謂日本爲從事中國戰事、於黃金方面及貿易與航業之損失上、均已支付重大之代價、遠東之戰爭長此繼續、恐有連續之重大犧牲、自一九三七年七月蘆溝橋事變以來、日本流入美國之價値美金七〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元之黃金數量、尙不過此項代價之一個指數、日本與軸心國之結合、其經濟負担不特未能减輕、反而增加、因德義兩國均不能與此遠東帝國、維持「供求」之商業關係、而此遠東帝國則可給與德義以貨品方面或役務方面之經濟援助、日本業已停止刊布各國之國際貿易統計、是或係因軍事關係、其與大陸貿易之總報吿、聞須經特別請求方可獲得、其金額準備總額、曾有一時聞爲日金五〇一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、衆信此乃一表面之數字、因此項數額之一部分、或許已撥作若干國內事務之用途、因旣無國際經濟活動之計數表及指數可觀、日本所能應付亞洲大陸戰爭經費之力量如何、頗費猜測、日本之輸出品、自必大部輸與所謂日金集團諸國、而日本所需之大部輸入品、亦必來自若干非日元集團之國家、此乃一定之事實、日本放棄多種海上航行運輸、以遂其必須之軍事運輸、亦爲其重大損失之間接因素、結果日木遂不得不在可能範圍內、以國內貨品代替舶來品、並令生活程度趨於普遍低降、日本此種情况、究能延續幾時、恐將視其所能徵用其人力及財運之力量如何其組織新工業之能力如何及擴張貿易於若干不發生外匯問題之國家之程度如何而定、美國官方之統計中、曾表明若干指數雖非十分準確、而亦足知日本爲建設其東亞新秩序所付可怖之經濟代價、一九三五年日本之外國貿易、全年均達於高度、而其工業生產是年亦達於高峯、其時日本以極低價格向市價低廉之外國市塲購取原料、以低廉之工資生產並利用其自有之航舶運輸、積極向工業自足及國際商業國家之地位邁進、而美國其時則爲日本所產之絲及製造品之優良市塲、不到二年後、至一九三七年七月便有蘆溝橋事變發生、自此時起、日本即購買無量數之工業原料及配備、以供軍事目的、而其經常之經濟亦大部分成爲應付戰事上之需要、於是日本於其與美國之貿易差額上、頓感甚大之不足、結果、日本之黃金乃大量流入美國、一九三七年日本流入美國之黃金、、以每盎斯純淨値美金三十五元計算、其總統爲美金三四六·五〇〇·〇〇〇元、一九三八年流入美國之金、共値美金一六八·七〇〇·〇〇〇元、个九三九年、入美黃金値美金一六九·六〇〇·〇〇〇元、一九四〇前十一個月、其流入美國之金、總値美金九八·四〇〇·〇〇〇元、恐以後尙有流入、因商業統計仍表示、有多量之美貨輸往日本係超過向日購買之數額、一九四〇年前十個月、美國輸往日本之貨、價値美金一九一·四一三·〇〇〇元、在一九三九年同一時期爲一七九·三七七·〇〇〇元、在本年中、日本所購之美國之木質纖維原料·石油鐵塊·鋼·銅·及金屬機器、數量頗爲增加、一九四〇年前十個月中、美國自日輸入之品、價値美金一二二·六六七·〇〇〇元、上年前爲美金一二五·三一二·〇〇〇元云、（十九日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰痛史（八）　英法陣綫零亂回憶</h3>
<p>穗機恐嚇平民的目的，居然大吿成功。後來我發現每一村莊中，都有一個德籍或比籍的便衣隊人員，只要一有炸彈落地，他們就逢人訴說：趁現在還來得及，快些逃難吧！村莊就要被毀成平地了，德國的秘密警察，就要跟着德機來此了。他們如何對待波蘭人，你們是知道的呀！</p>
<p>居民聽信讕言，於是全村如在，村長，牧師，官員，平民，相率逃之夭夭。沿路難民，猶如潮湧，眞是洋洋大觀。最先是富人的汽車，車夫都穿着手套，戴着時髦的帽子；其决是中產階級，他們自駕汽車，車頂上縛着舖蓋；再後是馬拖的大車，載家一家一眷；更後便是成羣結隊的步行者和騎脚踏車者了。</p>
<p>傳染的蔓延，沒有比逃難更容易的了。鄰近法國邊界的人浪，每經一村一鎮，這一村一鎭的居民，也就隨波逐浪而行。我軍優良的機械化部隊，第一天就要奮力在人浪中穿出穿進。</p>
<p>可是在一九一四年戰爭中，從未有過這樣的混亂，即在亞眠前綫被突破的當兒，也無如此的驚慌。爲什麼呢？因爲今日的恐怖，遠非一九一四年可比；因爲有人故意散佈謠言，深入人心，即使是一個愛國忘家的人，也將不顧犧牲，逃避這無限的危險；因爲大部份農民，在一九一四年時消息不靈，始終渾渾噩噩，現在却被無綫電中宣布的驚人消息所警醒；更因爲德國空軍在數量上佔有絕對優勢，使他們輕信自己的一無防衛。</p>
<p>假使要禁止他們出走，除非軍政當局具有絕大的毅力，無論何人，一概不准棄家離室，再在屋頂上佈置幾架機關槍，表示防禦的姿態，且祇有多派戰鬥機，翱翔比國天空，才能阻止住這班民衆，强迫他們安居原處。所可惜者，一班當局，也不免隨波逐流，至於機關槍和飛機，更是空無有所。每個人都爲恐怖所籠罩，而且呼籲無門，於是有路即逃，茫無目的，更是毫無秩序。</p>
<p>這種空前的大混亂，非特無法執行命令，而且惡運臨頭，這項命令，亦始終未能及時發出。總司令和十五位將領已遽遭撤職，魏剛將軍從叙利亞不遠千里而來，途中叉爲風雨阻，北路軍的指揮畢洛脫將軍，雖身臨大敵，仍胆識兼優，力支危局，不幸在千鈞一髮之時，撞車身亡。繼任的白朗沙將軍，能力不亞於畢洛脫將軍，但因倉卒接防，與所部缺乏聯絡，只得在最不利的環境下指揮戰事。</p>
<p>俗語說，「福無雙至，禍不單行，」種種意外和種種失敗的事，接踵而來，造成這樣滔天巨禍，使人每一念及，便要想到命運之神，每出人意料釀成各種悲劇，而嘆息造化的一何殘酷。</p>
<p>英國參謀部接得色當被德軍突破，和柯蘭普軍瓦解的消息之時，我也在參謀部。可是英國方面在兩天之內竟將這些情形隱匿不吿，他們是爲了謹愼，抑是爲了膽怯，則非吾所知了。戰報依然措辭審愼語意含糊。但我很容易看出其中必有隱情。他們一見我跨入室中，就立即停止談話。退兵的命令亦已發出。直到最後，英國方面纔把他們所知道的一吿我。</p>
<p>德軍突破我軍陣綫旣迅速而又澈底，完全集中攻擊，出奇制勝，和恐怖政策的結果。幾千輛噴火戰率，幾千架怪聲飛機，環攻柯蘭普一軍，即使是最勇敢的人，遇到這種意想不到和準備不及的攻勢，雖欲堅守陣地，亦未免困難。</p>
<p>德軍最有威力的戰車，裝甲堅厚，非砲彈所能洞穿，不免使法軍瞠目失色。斯柯達兵工廠所造鋼板，堅厚異常，我們的砲彈擊中了牠，不啻蜻蜓之撼石柱，休想損其毫末。法國砲兵總算機靈，發現他們的七五生的砲，若能運用得當，亦可作爲平射砲之用，但這僅是一時權宜之計，而不是一種有組織的防禦方法。</p>
<p>一班法國人在五月中都互相詢問，「德軍怎樣會渡過末斯河的？橋樑下難道沒有埋藏地雷？」當時英國軍中已盛傳德國傘兵和間諜已把負責炸毀橋樑的士兵槍殺，並且所埋的地雷，數量亦覺不足。不但此也，德國機械化部隊衝過亞爾丁森林時，曾大得便衣隊之助，因此前進速率，駭人聽聞，致令柯蘭普軍出其不意，措手莫及。</p>
<p>末斯河上會演出一幕可歌可泣的悲壯事蹟。英法飛機駕駛員，奉命不惜犧牲，務須把指定的橋樑炸燬。當時即有英法轟炸機各一隊，自願捨身報國。法機先行，飛行較低，英機隨後出發。法方損失之數，我從未得到報告，但知道六十架英機中，竟有四十架不知下落。</p>
<p>其他同樣的事蹟真是不勝枚舉，足見聯軍並非毫無勇氣。若說在戰爭初起時，聯軍即已士氣銷沉，不堪一戰，實是大謬不然。但像微生物一樣，對於身體健康之人，雖攻擊無效，若因疲勞憂思，以致身體衰弱，微生物即將乘虛而入，肆其荼毒。聯軍士氣本不十分旺盛，一見軍備不充，便不免江河日下了。</p>
<p>色當一敗，敵軍必勝論，便登時傳遍各地，畏葸後退的軍隊，都以此作爲藉口。敵軍機械化部隊禾到，恐怖的消息已先替牠開路。敵軍攻破色當之後即折向西進，抄擊北部聯軍。當時我在英國總參謀部，隨同遷至阿拉斯，以免被圍。阿拉斯滿城風雨，盛傳「德軍已到某處某處了……」這許多消息，未幾固然一一見諸事實，但在當時　係謠諑，可是一人傳十，十人傳百，一霎時男女老幼，紛紛逃難，甚至軍事當局，亦不免風聲鶴唳，草木皆兵，下令所部退往海岸，終作敵軍俘虜。</p>
<p>荷比境內德國傘兵如何如何，固非虛話，但是恐怖的傳說，徒足以助長他人威風，使其效力陡增十倍。農夫·兵士，逢人便疑是喬裝改扮。牧師已不再被人相信是眞牧師，穿制服的軍官，或有魚目混珠之嫌，電話電報，都使人疑眞疑假。</p>
<p>這種神怪的謠言，傳佈之速，比較德國的梅薩斯密特式驅逐機。還要迅疾百倍。小隊敵軍爲什麼能不流血而佔領要邑，都可由此解釋。少數配備齊整，膽勇過人的機械化部隊，往往衝進車站，擊殺幾個站員，即可使火車交通阻斷。實際上這些站員力足自衛，亦且義不容辭。我曾遇見過一羣英國工程師，掮著鏟執着斧，把敵軍摩托車先遣隊的隊員，殺得片甲不留。</p>
<p>威爾斯步兵和極少數法國輕裝步兵的防守阿拉斯，亦足爲掩護作戰的楷模。我眼見這些士兵，由法國軍官普米爾協助，不慌不忙，佈置防綫。繞城入口之處，都架起鐵絲網，堆滿沙袋，埋伏機關槍，平射砲。德國戰車來時，被他們擊毀數輛，其餘的也起火焚燒。敵軍被阻，繞城一匝，總是無隙可乘，全城勇敢有效的防御，維持至一星期，最後乃向鄧扣克全師而退。</p>
<p>這種優點，假使能在各軍均發現，魏剛將軍何難實行反攻，閉基阿拉斯至巴普美間的缺口，以截斷德軍後路。惜乎民衆紛紛逃難，秩序混亂，後備隊缺乏，交通路綫破壞，聯軍總參謀部又因敵方空軍活動而解體，即有錦囊妙計，亦無法實施，終至一籌莫展。德國間諜消息的靈捷，眞是神秘不可思議。統兵將領，一至村中，往往立足未定，敵機已來轟炸。（未完）</p>

<h3>劉大鈞與經濟學</h3>
<p>— 朱通九</p>
<p>（一）　起草本文之目的</p>
<p>張一凡先生電囑爲申報經濟專刋撰擬富於建議性質之論文一篇；當時未經思索，即行允許。但後經冉四攷慮，起草一篇論文甚易，而撰擬一篇富於建議性質之文章，實難若登天。設隨意胡寫，恐辱該刋令譽，旋檢查最近申報經濟專刊所披露之論文，討論經濟制度或經濟問題者居多數，而檢討經濟學本身之論文，則寥若晨星。推想最近滬市生活程度日高，執筆者爲應付環境關係，均以全力注意目下之生活問題，而對於空談原理與原則之經濟學，無暇顧及，此殆爲自然之趨勢，固無足稱奇者。不過正在搜索枯腸之時，忽憶及我國經濟學二大泰斗之一的劉大鈞光生，畢生盡瘁於經濟學，並發起組織中國經濟學社，鼓勵靑年學子從事於經濟學之深刻研究究；其有助於我國經濟學進展之勞績，與馬寅初先生共鳴於時；本年適壽登天命，筆者遂乘此機會，借經濟專刋之補白地位，叙述劉大鈞先生與經濟學之關係，促進我國經濟學進展之史實，固爲經濟專刋應宜批露，而劉大鈞先生以一生硏究經濟學，並時向政府當局建議如何發展我國國民經濟，亦頗合一凡先生所謂富於建議之性質；一舉兩得，頗感適宜；故本文視爲慶祝劉大鈞先生之壽文固可；即視爲富於建議性質之論文，亦無不可。</p>
<p>（二）劉大鈞先生之略歷與著作</p>
<p>劉大鈞先生在學術界地位之崇高，凡國內從事硏究經濟學與統計者，均各咸知；即英美各國硏究中國經濟者，亦莫不引用其著作所披露之數字，以爲論述之佐設。但國內其他各界，每於談論經濟學權威時，輒以馬寅初先生相推崇；而熟知劉大鈞先生者，人數則較少，如考查其原因，計有二項：其一，劉大鈞先生之著作，以英文寫成者居多數；馬寅初先生之著作，則大部份以中文發表；故國人以文字關係，閱讀馬氏之著作較多。其二，劉大鈞先生大部份之時間，消耗於整理統計數字，與主持調查工作居多；向大衆作公開演講之决數較少，馬寅初先生則在以往十餘年，到處作公開演講，與大衆見面之機會較多。現爲使各界熟悉劉氏在學術界之貢獻起見，將劉氏之略歷與著作，分述如决：</p>
<p>劉大鈞氏留學美國密歇根大學，最初研究工程，旋即專攻經濟學，爲美國著名經濟專家戴樂氏之高足。回國後先在淸華大學任敎，目下國內著名經濟學家蕭遽，陳宗，李權時氏等，一度均受其吉壇之沐化，旋協助端納氏主持北京經濟討論處，進行調查我國各地經濟情形工作，並編製各種經濟統計，出版中西文經濟刋物兩種；我國經濟調查工作，至此始　其端緒。故我國經濟調查工作之鼻祖，劉氏實當之而無愧。後劉氏又邀集燕京大學敎授戴樂仁，以及著名經濟學家陳長蘅，衛挺生，陳達，馬寅初諸氏，組織中國經濟學社；各社員推劉氏爲社長，提倡硏究經濟學與進行經濟調查工作，不遺餘力。使國人對於經濟事業之予以重大注意，厥功甚偉。迨民國十五年北伐成功以後，立法院院長胡漢民氏慕劉氏聲名，聘延劉氏担任立法院統計處處長；旋主計處成立，担任統計局局長，計劃全國統計工作之推進；擘劃周詳。在本時期內，劉氏爲提倡國人對於研究統計學之興趣起見，又發起組織中國統計學社，劉氏又被推爲社長；故我國目下統計工作之得有相當成績，似不得不歸功於劉氏之提倡居多。迨劉氏重行奉命出國調查世界統計事業歸來，鑒於經濟學與統計學之關係，至爲密切；遂發起由中國經濟學社與中國統計學社合組中國經濟統計硏究所，兩社均一致推戴劉氏爲該所所長，該所成立未久，政府委託該所調查全國工業；歷二年餘之時間，始將全國工業調查完竣，編有中國工業調查報吿三大冊，爲我國調查工作之最偉大者，常爲學術界所推崇。戰前劉氏又接受中央委託，計劃推進國民經濟建設運動，頗著勞績，即推進國民經濟建設運動之四大標語：「人盡其才，地盡其利，物盡其用，貨暢其流，」亦係出自劉氏之手筆，現劉氏任國民經濟硏究所所長，硏究計劃經濟。</p>
<p>至於近年劉氏已出版之著作，重要者計有下列各書：</p>
<p>書名　出版日期</p>
<p>中國工業與其財務（英文）　一九二七年八月</p>
<p>各國在華投資（英文）　一九二九年十月</p>
<p>中國統計工作（英文）　一九三〇年七月</p>
<p>一九一二年中國人口調查（英文）　一九三一年七月</p>
<p>上海工業化初步報告（英文）　一九三三年七月</p>
<p>上海繅絲業（英文）　一九三三年七月</p>
<p>上海之工業化及其發展（英文）　一九三六年七月</p>
<p>經濟編制與編制經濟（中文）　一九三九年七月</p>
<p>中國之絲織業（英文）　一九四〇年十月</p>
<p>（三）劉大鈞先生之治學精神</p>
<p>劉大鈞先生研究經濟學之方法，與美國哥倫比亞大學教授密謙爾氏之採用數量分析方法，大致相同。不過美國統計事業，業已發達；各種經濟統計，已由政府或私立機關編製。密謙爾氏所需各種經濟統計，一經搜集，即能從事分析。而我國統計事業，尚待發展；故劉氏在開始研究以前，猶須担任墾荒工作，先行從事經濟調查事宜；因此劉氏之治學方法，雖與密謙爾氏大致相同，然劉所遇之困難，實較密謙爾氏所感覺者遠甚。劉氏有鑒於此，對於引用數學，特殊謹愼，以冀其所論列者，適合於事實，　有俾於實用。蓋經濟學爲經世濟民之學，凡所建議與提倡者，對於國民經濟，息息相關。設所引數字，與事實不符，不特使國人對於統計之功效，發生懷疑；抑且經濟學之應用性，亦不覺爲之大爲低减矣。夫劉氏除謹愼引用數字以外，又博覽羣書，分析外國之陳規，俯察國內之事實，衡情酌理，再四硏求，書後決定對策，下筆論述。故劉氏之治學精神，可謂精細求實，其與一般以「雖不中亦不遠矣」之態度從事者述者，相去遠矣。</p>
<p>（四）劉大鈞先生對於我國經濟學之貢獻</p>
<p>設就目下我國經濟學理論方面觀察之，我國經濟學之理論，仍在輸入與倣傚時期；其距難創作之日期，依舊頗覺遙遠。故近年我國著名經濟學家對於經濟學之貢獻，大部份爲輸入外貨工作，劉大鈞先生自亦不能逃此例外。劉氏對於經濟理論，雖未創造新頴學說，嘉惠於國人；然劉氏從事經濟調查工作與編製經濟統計外，以及鼓勵後進努力於深刻之硏究，則其在墾荒情狀之下，促成經濟學近年進展之功績，實亦不容忽略。茲將劉氏對於經濟學之貫獻，分述如决：</p>
<p>（一）從事調查工作供給「國貨」經濟資料　李權時氏提倡編者國貨敎科書，以代替舶來品；用意良佳，爲時人所欽佩。但李氏編著國貨敎科書時所採用之原料，其大部份仍係舶來。劉大鈞氏所担仟之工作，適與李氏相反；提倡調查我國各地經濟狀况，編製調查作研究「國貨」經濟學之原料。故劉氏對於經濟學之第一貢獻，即在以調查方法入手，供給「國貨」經濟資料，以便將來有志編製「國貨」敎科書者採用。</p>
<p>（二）以「國貨」材料編製「國貨」統計　劉氏以調查所得數字，編製「國貨」統計使國人瞭解本國各項經濟動態，固爲劉氏對於社會供獻之一。然劉然將所編各項「國貨」統計數字發表以後，不特可供外國經濟學者，作爲研究我國經濟變遷之根據，抑且可使國內經濟學家利用其數字，藉證明由外國輸入之經濟理論，在我國是否適用。此爲劉氏對於經濟學之第二種貢獻。</p>
<p>（三）採用數量分析法以硏究經濟學　在二十年以前，楊杏佛氏曾以零碎之數字，著論文一篇，在東方雜誌發表；元老吳稚暉氏譽爲鳳毛麟角，一時不易多得之佳構。但劉氏比較楊氏更進一步，除由直接調查經濟情形，編製經濟統計外，復利用其調查所得之數字，從事分析，以明瞭其變化之因果，藉作將來從事改善之南針；此爲劉氏對於經濟學之第三種貢獻。</p>
<p>（四）思想前進爲靑年經濟學家之向導　劉氏之治學方法，旣與一般徒憑主觀之空想者不同；而其思想，又極前進，常爲靑年經濟學家之向導。蓋劉氏對於世界經濟名著，固無不瀏覽；即國內外新出版之雜誌，亦莫不勤於閱讀；故劉氏對於世界經濟思潮之趨勢，按圖索驥，瞭如指掌。至於劉氏在經濟科學中最感興趣者，厥爲貨幣金融與工業建設；因此以往行政當局或立法當局，關於上述二項政策之決定，或立法方面之起草，固莫不徵詢劉氏之意見；即近年出國留學之大學畢業生，在出國以前，大部份均赴劉氏處請益，請其指導硏究方法與研究之對象。故劉氏雖已脫離學校生活有年，而其指導靑年之敎育工作，始終權續如前。於此可知劉氏除對於政府當局担任顧問工作以外，又兼任培植靑年經濟學家之指導工作，此爲劉氏對於我國經濟學之第四種貢獻。</p>
<p>（五）今後對於國人之希望</p>
<p>近年我國經濟學雖較以前大爲進步，然今後仍待國人開發之園地，猶極遼闊。筆者叙述劉氏對於經濟學貢獻之餘，不覺百感彙集。今後我儕靑年，除倣傚劉氏之治學精神外，希望國人注意下列各點，共同努力：</p>
<p>（一）認識現實　以往我國從事研究經濟學者，常輕信理論而忽略事實，並以不注意國內經濟實狀爲尤甚。因此僅利用其簡單羅輯，信口開何；忽爾以建議莫期科之辦法，試行於西安；忽爾提倡以支加哥之制度，試行於漢口；忽爾又建議以倫頓之陳規，試行於上海；凡此種種，不一而足。如考查其所以大胆建議之原因，實由於未能認識現實所致。故今後我儕研究我國經濟，其第一先決條件，必須先行認識我國經濟實况。如舉辦經濟調查工作，或赴內地作實際之攷察；庶可避免閉門造車，不能合軌之弊矣。</p>
<p>（二）注意歷史的發展　各種經濟制度之形成，必先具有歷史之背境。一種制度之變遷，亦必具有客觀之條件。而未來制度之構成，又必備有不可缺少之環境。故其來也旣非偶然，其去也亦非隨意。由因求果，從果尋因，彼此均有息息相關之關係。此種關係維何？名之曰歷史的進展。今後我儕硏究經濟制度之變遷，理宜注意歷史發展之過程，始能明瞭其變遷之趨勢。否則所建議者不特削足就履，甚難適於實用；抑且緣木求魚，叉何俾於實益？其欲避免空想之義也，不可得矣。</p>
<p>（三）愼用數字與數字分析　數字不說謊，固爲公認之原則；但數字本身之可靠性，在應用以前，必須注意其來源。吾則轉輾誤用，其流弊至大。故今後我儕硏究經濟學，一面自須步武劉氏之後鏖，採用數量分析法；然在引用數字以前，必先考查其來源及其準確性之程度如何。設所用數字之準確性，並不甚高；則其歸納所得結論。論應用性，恐低至零度以下矣。</p>
<p>（四）研究經濟學應從貨幣金融着手　以往經濟學者分析一國經濟之進展，常以物價爲中心；故各大學敎授經濟學，亦隨追外國之舊法，從消費，生產，交易，分配之四分法依决講授，但我國自採用法幣制度以後，我國貨幣金融，大非昔比。今後硏究我國經濟之變遷，必須先從貨幣金融着手。蓋一國企業之進展，繫乎對內推銷與對外輸出。而對內推銷，須視貨幣對內價値之高下；同時對外輸出，則受貨幣對外價値昂賤所支配；故英儒馬夏爾氏所著經濟學原理一書，摒貨幣金融於論述之外，似覺僅檢討經濟學之軀殼，而忽略經濟學之動脈與精神；對於現代之環境，已不甚適合。故今後我儕硏究經濟學，可以不必追從馬夏爾氏之靜態研究，始爲合理。</p>
<p>（五）重視計劃經濟　戰時施行各項經濟統制制度，常可視爲經濟統制之嘗試。迨至戰事結束以後，必有一部份統制性質，寄庽於經濟制度之內，定必難免。徵諸第一次歐戰後之史實，不難班班可攷。故我國戰事結束以後，因各地瘡痍滿目，經濟極待復興；然如依過去之任其自由發展，在戰後之中國，實覺不甚適宜；爲督促其加速復興與現代化起見，必須採用計劃經濟，使其依照計劃，按步實施。因此今後研究經濟學之國人，應根據上述（一）（二）（三）與（四）四點之基本原則，從事計劃經濟之研究；並應共同努力，以符先賢顧亭林氏所謂「天下興亡，匹夫有責」之義焉。</p>
<h3>總結束聲中紗廠盈利烏瞰</h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>一年一度的工廠·公司·商號總結束，又將屆臨！雖然各工商機關的結賬決算手續。是大多數依照着國歷年度，而催還賬款，分派官紅利等，却依舊照廢歷年關，（廢歷實廢而不廢也，）際茲舊歲云暮的總結束聲中，纔揭露了一年來經營的成績！但實際還是秘而不宣，以免論者非罪，而懷璧其罪之感！筆者斯文，祇寫些輸廓而已，確實如何？還在不言之中吧？</p>
<p>誰都知道，孤島上碩果僅存的華商紗廠的鴻運！是在祖國危急，存亡之中的一個千載難逢的黃金時代！前昨兩年，賺幾百萬元的，是稀鬆平常之事！不過今年的盈利成績？雖然相形見絀些，但是還很豐厚！擁有四千紡錠的小紗廠，也能賺五六十萬元，至於擁有十萬紡錠以上的大紗廠，仍可購到千萬元左右，能不驚人？</p>
<p>我們要知道，一件二十支紗的標準成木，是棉花値佔到九百元光景，（便宜原料，花本祗須七百多元）開繳費佔到兩百元光景，（生產量多的，一百七八十元足够了，）總成本是共計一千一百多元，而目前市價，已漲到一千四五百元，即使常年統扯市價在一千二三百元的盤子，每件二十支紗，至少可凈賺一百五十元光景，何况三十二支，和十二支紗，每件能賺到兩三百元呢？每一紡錠，平均生產量是出紗一·二磅，那麼擁有四千紡錠的，就可出產四千二百磅，合紗十件，每年紗凈購一百五十元，一日夜的工作，就是總賺一千五百元一天，一個月賺四萬五千元，不是像上面所述的要賺到五六十萬元了嗎？有十萬紡錠以上的，就是二十五倍於四千紡錠之數，賺二十五倍的五六十萬。不是要賺進一千二三百萬元了嗎？不過今年本棉被嚴厲統制，外棉進口不易。水脚，保險等費加重，而開繳中物料一項，亦倍於往年，所以各華商紗廠，比之去年，盈利估計約打一個八折，盈額最鉅的，要推申新九，（雙馬紅牌廠家，聽說明年要由十五家大紗號包銷了？）申新二，（出天女牌紗）新裕一二兩廠，（出地球牌紗紗）永安三廠（出特金城紗），决之如：安達，（出飛馬紗）新生，（出金虎牌紗）合豐，榮豐等廠，營業成績，皆極可觀！去年紗廠職員的花紅，可以分得百分之六七百，（就是月薪百元的，到年終苒可以拿六七百元一個月，十二個月總計就是匕八千元呢。）而在今年？叫五元（每一元薪金，再拆四五元）總可分得的，所以賺百元月薪的中級職員，也得成爲小富翁了！不過平時家庭生活開銷，廠規沒有借支的，到了年底，花紅纔是唯一的收穫！唯一移東還西的目標！至於經理們的大富？是可以推想的了！</p>

<p>本廠貨呢羢、邇來交易頗盛、因來路貨昂缺、兼實配門市顧客之胃口、本廠貨銷化較之來路貨爲　暢、茲爲業中人俱看後市有漲無跌、貨都居奇、行情挺俏、其寅豐財神虎、與怡和五福圖、及美綸聖誕老人等脾子、因奪波金華等內地可以行銷、貨價因較他廠出品爲硬、交易更爲暢盛、昨財神虎元直貢呢每碼批沽二十六元、五福圖駝斯錦馬褲呢爲廿五元七角半、聖誕老人板四呢海律斯爲十元淨盤、</p>
<h3>五金　囤貨期待紅盤</h3>
<p>邇來五金市面、因歲暮在即、各業預備結束、買賣頓失常態、各貨行情、有漲無落、其原因係來貨稀少、而本埠所存、究屬有限、故囤貨心思堅昂、以期新春紅盤之挺秀、昨日如會司鐵一百八十元、單連馬口鐵一百四五十元、雙連板二百七八十元、本廠釘七十五元、新盤元八十元、黑鐵坯子一千三百元等、</p>

<h3>食糧不足之洋米進口觀</h3>
<p>— 劉仲廉</p>
<p>米爲我國食品之大宗，而南方人民允恃以爲必需之品，不可一日或缺者也。我國產米之區，如江蘇·浙江·四川·湖北·湖南·安徽·江西·等省所佔之面積，至爲廣大，生產之額，亦屬不少。但近年以來，常感供不敷求之虞，間嘗考其癥結之所在，則不外下列數種：</p>
<p>（一）我國農業不發達；</p>
<p>（二）我國人口日漸繁盛，生產者少而消費者多；</p>
<p>（三）年來烽火連天，萑苻遍地，農民逃亡，田畝爲墟，以致歲無稔年；</p>
<p>（四）奸商利慾薰心，囤積居奇；</p>
<p>（五）年來產米之區，大都不種禾稻，而各就其地質之適宜改種棉花豆麥或蔬菜果品之類；</p>
<p>（六）日本食糧受政府嚴格之統制後，農民轉營其他產業者漸决增加，以致國內農人感覺不敷，食糧生產，隨以减少，其向吾國淪陷區內運去之糧食爲數當不少；加以在華軍隊之給養，完全仰給於華米，年來吾國食米之缺乏，此亦一重大原因。</p>
<p>上述數點，與民食之缺乏，皆有直接之原因。吾人旣感民食之不足，爲彌補是項缺陷起見，遂不得不賴洋米之接濟矣</p>
<p>查吾國外米最初輸入之時，爲額無幾，故關稅槪予免徵，所以　民食也。光緒初元，輸入尙少，其後逐漸增加，民國元年增至二百七十餘萬擔，四年增至八百四十餘萬擔，五年增至一千一百二十餘萬擔，其後稍减，九年僅有一百十五萬一千餘擔，迨十年以後，又趨增勢，十二年竟至二千二百四十餘萬擔，十三年後又復减少，十六年又增至二千一百餘萬擔，最近數年間之輸入額，大都在三四百萬擔之間，計二十六年之輸入額達三百四十餘萬擔，二十七年爲四百餘萬擔，二十八年爲三百二十餘萬擔，茲就民元以來洋米進口數量，列表如左，（單位擔）</p>

<h3>家庭年景</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>——菓盤與案頭淸供——</p>
<p>一年容易，又將除歲而歡迎新春之來臨，於是千門萬戶，忙忙碌碌地辦年貨，無不憧憬到爆竹（孤島上被禁止，祇有以甩金錢砲爲代用品了。）一聲除舊，桃符萬戶更新」的新氣象·現在，許多家庭中，平添了觸目驚心的應時點綫品，一是「菓盤」，一是「案頭淸供」——臘梅天竹水仙，雖僅堪容膝的斗室，亦得勉力佈置一下，以爲迎歲接客塲面，而亦爲辛勤一年之後，見見氣象，換換新環境呢。</p>
<p>菓盤，亦謂之壓歲盤，據夢粱錄云，「除夜，內司意思局，進呈精巧消夜果子合，合內簇諸般細果，及市食」。按：舊俗於除夕歲首，長老予小兒女以果盤，謂之壓歲盤，據夢粱錄所記，此風蓋由來久矣。而今市上出售之菓盤，更加光怪陸離，花團錦簇了。有巧格力，有花生果糖，奶油糖，杏花糖，陳皮梅，橘子，香蕉糖等……更裝以綢帶玻璃面的錦盒，目迷五色，神爲之眩。可是一盒之代價，從十數金起，而數上金，而百金，決非窮措大所敢問津，所能染指。即捨整盤而購散裝，每磅亦需兩三元至六七九，價値之昂，幾數倍於往年；在窮人心理，祇得「盤」算着如何「果」腹，如何度年，那裏談得到陳設「果盤」呢？</p>
<p>案頭淸供的臘梅，天竹，水仙，倒是象微着，志士，忠臣，義士，的三不屈主義，即不受利誘，不受威迫，不受汚辱，你瞧臘梅的高節，天竹的赤心，水仙的純潔，不與凡卉爭妍，不畏風雪摧殘，不怕天寒地凍，三者的冰雪精神，令人肅然起敬。供諸几案，朝夕借鑑，以自警惕。說起梅花盆景，那麼百樂商塲孔志淸君的作品，佈置得盆盆入畫，最爲够味，無論如何寒酸，總得買一盆回去應應兒。寫到這裏，我又痛心於楊樹浦老家的一隻精美菓盤是斷送了！幾尾活躍在玻璃缸裏的金魚，和梅花盆景是爲國犧牲了！我想它們的精神不死，必定長留正氣於天地之間。</p>
<h3>西裝長袍中山裝</h3>
<p>— 包福星</p>
<p>我們所處的時代中，我們所處的這上海都市中，一般人的衣服，不外西裝長袍以及中山裝三種。社會上思想較新的份子，大都穿着西裝，尤其是像學生等靑年人，另一部份較保守的份子，則多穿長袍。至於中山裝，以前學生和公務員曾採用爲制服，眼前似乎是很少見的了。</p>
<p>有些人對中西服裝抱持着一種錯誤的見解。以爲穿西裝是洋化，穿長袍是泥古，將眼光看重在「洋」「古」的界限上。其實任何服裝只求其經濟方便，何必問它「中」「西」「洋」「古」呢？</p>
<p>平時每當我穿上長袍時，總是覺得很舒服的，不過一旦做起事來，就很不方便了；袖管嫌太寬大，而且走起路來也沒有西裝來得便當。長袍還有一大缺點：穿長袍的人的精神，往往容易變成「文質彬彬」而無從振發。</p>
<p>記得有人說西裝現在已經成爲世界裝了。的確，在我國連上海在內，西裝已被廣大地採用了。這並不是虛慕「洋化」，實在因爲西裝自有其優點所在。試問許多穿西裝的人士中，能找出幾位是駝背的？很奇怪，西裝似平有一種力量能使我們的腰幹自然挺直起來。除此而外，西裝還有一個很足重視的優點，也即是長袍的缺點所在，那就是它能使我們走路做事比較有精神。</p>
<p>比較地說起來，長袍當然不至於穿不得，不過西裝究是來得較好。但是，近年來有些人又以爲西裝也不完善，例如領帶等東西，又繁又多餘，要它何用？扣緊在頸項上，豈不有礙衛生之道，（這似乎是林語堂的幽默的見解）對於這種見解，我是很贊同的。不但贊同而已，我更以爲西裝的式樣是不整齊而且難看的，頸項前面爲甚麼要空出地位來打領帶？右上角爲甚麼不要一個口袋？因此，我以爲西裝也不可取</p>
<p>最後，我想貢獻一種服裝於諸君之前，那就是我們國父所首創的中山裝。中山裝可以說是近乎西裝，不過却較西裝更爲漂亮而整齊，又可除去打領帶等繁雜而不必要的俗套，裏，還想請諸君想一想：穿中山裝後，在走路做事各方是否方便而有精神？</p>

<p>（七二）生炒肝片子（　培之擬稿）</p>
<p>預備……雞蛋　鮮蝦　火腿　冬筍　猪油　鹽味精　辣醬油</p>
<p>製法…把鷄蛋敲在碗內，鮮蝦擠出蝦肉，火颶及冬筍均切成細粒，猪油切成小塊，一起併入蛋碗內，和以適量之細鹽，味精後卽用箸打和，另取小盅數隻，盅之四週塗以熟猪油，再把蛋槳盛於盅內，上面用物蓋好，置於蒸籠內蒸熟，然後分別倒出，再用油煎之，煎至略露焦黃色時卽成，食時以辣醬油蘸，最爲相宜諸君…如欲購買「味精」，「天廚醬油精液」，及油鹽醬醋者，請撥電話「四四五九四」，當卽專差送奉，不取送力。</p>
<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>這又是農歷過年的時候了。照着常年老例，接近了年關，一切葷菜素菜，都要漲價，而今年尤其漲得嚇人。這幾天在小菜塲上遇到了幾位熟識的主婦，都在搖頭歎息，一疊連聲的喊着「貴！貴！貴！」你帶了三四十塊錢在身邊，想買些鷄啊，魚啊，鮮肉醃肉啊，竟有無從下手之苦，只得提着空籃子回去。像這樣的情形，向所未有，眞使人感到不是吃菜，是在吃法幣了。奉勸主婦們，耍是財力寬裕的話，那麽　你到小菜塲去擺闊，如其力有未逮，大家還是省省吧，管什麼過年不過年！</p>

<h3>住之周全</h3>
<p>— 王一之</p>
<p>土木營造之最新識騐，上海人大有用處·</p>
<p>當世營造家，防患於未發，近以歐戰復興，悟得預防「空襲」之最新議解如下述</p>
<p>（一）方城式四面圍合之住宅，中間留出隙地為後院，而與左右後三方鄰戶，僅隔一垣或一柵，旣無可通之門，又無可以向外疾走之出路，偶遇空軍轟炸，「氣壓」內逼，而不易向遠處推開，破壞力必爲加大，危險性或更倍增。新法力避死街堂與風火高墻之圍困，改爲前後駢列而兩端不相接之甬道，而即取甬道之隙地爲後院，且此甬道間望衡對宇之兩行樓屋，至少有二十四公尺之距離</p>
<p>（二）數家合住之大樓，除由樓梯之升降，公用前方之大鬥外，必須加築樓梯一道，再向後院另開一門，梯底最宜於闢儲物室，以代防空窖·</p>
<p>（三）料厚値昂之屋，新法可於下樓梯出門之後，通過隧道，走上街面。</p>
<p>（四）居家必闢三門，一爲前門，二爲後門，三爲比鄰可互通之門·</p>
<p>（五）屋之幹材，改用鋼骨混凝土，旣免祝融之肆虐，復阻聲浪之外傳·</p>
<p>（六）住屋內部窗與地板之間，勿任有木材之相連觸，室內平舖之地板，勿任其與鄰室地板相連觸，此法皆以防火患·</p>
<p>（七）室內過道或防空窖，頂承磚石固砌之圓穹，（略如中國城鬥洞，）最有防止坍陷之抵抗力，對於防空，頗有用處，而木質之樓梯，最好避而不一用·</p>
<p>（八）凡遭「氣壓」激射之轟震嵌入小窗格之玻璃，破損較少·若爲大塊玻璃，勿忘加裝嚴阻燈光洩漏之「百葉木窗Jaloladen」於其外，或則外罩便於抽起又便落下之鐵片「轆幕Roladen」，以資掩護，兼免專火管制下窗帘隙處微光外透之弊·</p>
<p>（九）居家必備之防患利器，　爲開掘泥土之鑛，二爲打通阻塞之斧，三爲遇險呼救之搖鈴，四爲長達六公尺直徑八分之三公釐mm·連「攀鈞Carbine　Hook」而極便攀高緊重之爬繩·</p>
<p>漫話</p>
<p>— 念雲</p>
<p>「多吃飯，少開口」，這句話在今日說起來，似乎不大摩登。</p>
<p>米價貴，人人都感受到威脅，惟有米店裏的老鼠，却毫無影響，食之不盡，令人不勝羨慕。</p>
<p>從前寫信給尊長，到末了會祝上一句「努力加餐」的話，可是如今却有些難以落筆哩</p>
<p>雖然「孤島」上餓死的人很多，但飽死的人却也不少呢。</p>
<h3>衣食住行之年市近態（下）</h3>
<p>— 天視</p>
<p>其以代木者，如製爲簫，吹之聲清靈，製爲偎胡琴Violine，（四弦琴，）扯之聲澈越。其以代鐵者，如製為彈簧，嬝而不折。製爲掛壁之時鐘，（如附圖二）則大自鐘面，小至輸盤或指針，或具彈性之發條，莫不表裏透明，製爲照相器之鏡頭或女衣之裝飾品，則晶瑩若玻璃，良工疑鬼斧楮玉難分辨。</p>
<p>四曰行　今人用以替代硬橡皮而微具彈性之器材，似以滴石Trolit爲較新頴。滴石乃如泉水滴下岩隙炭酸石灰經久凝積而下垂之鐘乳石，同以石灰石炭爲原料，茍遇攝氏百二十五度乃至百九十五度之高熱，即軟如泥，再經高壓力之迸射入冷器，即便就範成型，可以製爲指南針盤·眼鏡套·打字機匣·自來水筆桿或鉛筆管。另有同以石灰石炭爲原料，使循化學中繁複過程而成型之「岐異複合體Mipolam。其物似革，又似橡皮，乃經一度改良之人造橡皮，可不再於用舊之後顯裂痕。其用以代皮革者，爲製女性出門用之旅行提包或手袋。其用以代金屬物者，多製成管，比諸紅銅與鉛之重，不過八分之一。可彎，可鋸，可剪，可磨，並可著錐成孔，不引燃，不受油水硝酸硫酸等物之侵蝕，且不因水中潛起化學作用而遭腐毀，更不令入管而又出管之液體，沾惹些微惡臭或異味。療養地之礦泉，裝此岐異複合體水管，極便分配欽料，以向各處水龍頭，茶餐館得此器材爲水管，且可不費搬送之勞，而汲取地窖藏酒。</p>

<h3>年夜飯前秦</h3>
<p>— 錘子芒</p>
<p>節日是屬於闊人的，像黃經理，潘買辦，過了聖誕過冬至，過了冬至還過陽曆年，陽曆年三天玩盡，黃太太，潘太太們又去買年貨，準備吃年夜飯了…</p>
<p>南貨店裏擠着兩三層的人，太太們却有一隻椅子可坐，安閒的揀着上等的木耳，海參，香蕈，銀魚，和年靑的夥計談着笑着，夥計一包包的紮着繩，娘姨便一包包往汽車裏堆，汽車好像一個倉庫，這流動的倉庫啦，窮人們對他彈着眼睛！</p>
<p>新發明：年夜飯，每桌四十元，五十元…一百二十元：「歡迎預定年夜飯」，「狀元年夜飯」，「財神年夜飯」，「發財年夜飯」—發財，發財，富人越闊，在吃了年夜飯之後，打着囤積的算盤，明年開一個利市，準瞄着這裏來一下，撈一筆啊撈一筆…</p>
<p>在「禁止小便」的墻頭有着一張灰白的紙，那是學徒的苦訴，歪七歪八的鉛筆字，是血淚的交流：「先生們，我們不及重（種）田的人，老板（闆）過年只有四塊錢給我們，我們怎麼够！」之後是一張日常必需的生活費用：「理髮三角，布鞋一雙兩塊，牙刷每隻三角牛，手巾，肥皂，油氽果肉…」這是一個貧窮學徒最低的限用，可是大家分四塊錢眞的「怎麼够」，在那「銀檯面」的年夜飯席上，是新鮮的菜肴，是新鮮的翠綠的水仙花枝—只消磨一夜的時問，學徒一年的最粗劣的必需品啊！一年！一年的一個新的需求，一個水平下的物質慾望，但，還是一個零…</p>
<p>先生們，想都看到一個新聞，一個少婦在上電車的時候，大的因了吃得太飽的緣故，嘔出了吃進去的魚肉和飯屑，馬上不待淸道夫的煩神，便有一個窮苦的人把嘔下的再吃進去，…這故事，不，這活的畫面，最前進的畫家也沒有想到這題材吧。是的，是在許多人吃年夜飯的一個夜裏裏，在弄堂裹，有着一個動物在糟桶裏掏着，掏着人家吃剩下來年夜飯的殘屑，唷已晴得很干凈的肉骨頭。是狗？不，是人…</p>
<p>窮人過一天是一天，那些打腫了胖臉過活的人，只能把淚水望肚裏嚥呢。—年關年關—開銷開銷—躱債躱債：三部嚴密而沒有鬆懈的曲子擾着這些人的耳鼓。年夜飯拖吧拖吧，但拖到最後一個日子總要吃啦，但是，不能像經理買辦之流吃完了抹了嘴就是了—後面有着黑闇的重閘…</p>
<p>年夜飯有人吃兩頓—小年夜飯，大年夜飯；有人愁苦的吃，有人高興的吃，更有沒有吃的人……</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦廋鷗</p>
<p>他隨手丟過了那截烟尾，低下頭，拍去了身七的烟灰，完全沒有需要紹文再來證實他所說的話的意思，彷彿眞是很解事的模樣</p>
<p>「這個怕我還不知道嗎？」洋裝先生不甘示弱的說。</p>
<p>袁紹文先向他們兩位笑了一笑，然後搖着腦袋說：</p>
<p>「這個名字是他自己和我兩個人一起想出來的，它的理由一時恐不容易猜到吧！」他回頭去向那瘦長子看了一眼。「仲遷先生儘管是一位評劇家，可是方才的話却沒有說對……。」</p>
<p>瘦長子很爲難地把左手撚弄着自己的八字鬚，因爲紹文批評他的話沒有說對，固然使他有些不高興；但紹文稱他爲評劇家，却又十分合他心意。</p>
<p>「這個名字倒並不是像什麽紅牡丹，芙蓉花，小靈芝，那樣的只是爲着要給人家看了，馬上覺得很香艶而起的。」袁紹文歪着身子，一手托定了下頷，用着很興奮的語音說：「那是今年夏天的事。小吳的娘才去世了一二十天，他因爲很傷心，留在家裏沒有出臺，便天天要我去伴他談天，順便把我去年敎過他的幾本書溫習溫習。倒別看他是個唱戲的孩子，心裏居然還知道有國家！時常向我打聽時局的消息，並且問我中國倒底給人家欺侮得怎麼樣了。我當然就把知道的盡量吿訴他，一面還給他譬方說，中國的地形，整個兒連起來，恰像一片秋海棠的葉子，而那些野心的國家，便像專吃海棠葉的毛蟲，有的已在葉的邊上咬去了一塊，有的還在葉的中央呑嚙着，假使再不能把這些毛蟲驅開，這片海棠葉就得給它們嚙盡了……。」</p>
<p>「不錯，譬方得眞好！」穿西裝的年輕人，用指頭敲着桌子說，很天眞地表示贊同；那瘦長子却又另外燃旺了一支砲臺牌，顯得並不怎樣愛聽。　（一三）</p>

<p>許多好奇的孩子便四方聚來，圍成了一個圓圈。</p>
<p>那個傢伙在盡什麼呢？有些孩子這樣想着。</p>
<p>『一條蛇！一條蛇！」過不了多久，許多孩子便這樣地喊着。</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Inaugurated for a Third Term Today; Will Deliver Historic Address Broadcast Worldwide; and Review Army Grand Maneuvers in Front of the White House</h3>
<p>Washington - In the midst of the most eventful period in American history, President Roosevelt and Vice President Wallace will be inaugurated tomorrow on a specially erected platform in front of the Capitol Building. Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court will administer the oath. After the oath, the President will deliver a historic address, broadcast to the world via radio. Following the ceremony, a grand military parade will take place on Pennsylvania Avenue, showcasing the latest American weaponry. Diplomats from various countries will attend this demonstration at the White House. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt's inaugural address is expected to be very brief, lasting only a few minutes. President's Secretary Early told reporters that the President has already detailed his policies in his fireside chats and addresses to Congress, and does not intend to elaborate further. The President's inaugural ceremony will be broadcast throughout Europe and the Americas, and the inaugural address will be translated into at least seven languages for domestic broadcast. President Roosevelt is the first person in American history to be sworn in for a third time as President. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>American Defense Council Leaders Endorse Aid to Britain Bill</p>
<p>America's Safety Would Be Hard to Guarantee if Britain Were to be Defeated; Defense Programs Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>Washington - Knudsen, the leader of the Defense Council, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, urging the swift passage of the bill, stating that its passage is part of America's defense. When the committee asked if he was satisfied with the progress of the defense program, Knudsen replied that he was, and that the defense program is proceeding smoothly, but that a true indication will only be possible when the tools are available. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington - Chairman Knudsen of the Defense Committee testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that if Britain were to fall, America would ultimately have to fight the Axis powers. Therefore, Knudsen strongly urged the committee to pass the Aid to Britain Bill. At that time, Massachusetts Representative Edith Nourse Rogers suggested requiring Britain to relinquish raw materials such as tin, rubber, and aluminum as collateral. Knudsen replied, "Collateral would be a good thing, but wouldn't we be going too far by demanding it?" Mrs. Rogers then asked if the United States would assume the role of world police. Knudsen replied no, and continued, "The progress of the defense program is not entirely satisfactory at present, but I believe that it will achieve everything expected of it in the future." The current delay in military production means that the full equipment for the 2.2 million-man army originally planned last summer, as well as the military equipment for another 800,000 men, will not be completed until the end of 1942. The delay in military equipment is especially severe, including heavy artillery, heavy ammunition, and machine guns. He further stated that the bill must be passed even if Britain's payments are zero, and that aid must be provided now, as time and speed are the most important factors, and it is absolutely essential for the United States to be fully armed and capable of protecting its coast. Even if this bill is passed immediately, the increased price of aid to Britain will not be seen until the end of 1941; otherwise, only existing American military equipment can be given to Britain. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Kennedy Broadcasts; Strongly Advocates Avoiding War</p>
<p>Urges the Nation to Support the President; British Morale is High and They Will Not Fail</p>
<p>New York - Former Ambassador to Britain, Joseph Kennedy, broadcasted a speech to the nation last night, attacking President Roosevelt's Aid to Britain Bill, stating that, according to his belief, the United States is not currently in such great danger that Congress needs to relinquish its authority. After the bill is reviewed by both houses, a more moderate approach will emerge, "to grant the President new powers, but no matter how the new approach appears, the responsibility of every American citizen remains very clear, which is to rise up and support the President." Kennedy advocated directly giving Britain military equipment, arms and aircraft, but insisted that the United States must stay away from war unless attacked, recognizing that war is the bankruptcy of democratic countries. Even if victorious, the United States would have to be on guard in Europe for decades to prevent the defeated countries from becoming communist. If the United States declares war, it will not make Britain win quickly, nor will it increase Britain's strength to match Germany. "A just peace is absolutely impossible to see in Europe at this time, because Hitler has closed this path." Currently, Germany cannot conquer Britain because of the twenty miles of water separating them, so it will not be able to cross the Atlantic to attack the United States in the future, and the United States has no hope of occupying Europe. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>New York - Former Ambassador to Britain, Joseph Kennedy, forcefully refuted defamatory messages spread since his return from Britain in a broadcast last night, stating that when he arrived in the United States, he declared that staying out of the war was what the United States could and should do, but that all kinds of aid should be given to Britain. His position was the same then as it is now. However, some people have made various false accusations about his views on foreign policy. Those who question the possibility of British victory are labeled as defeatists. He said that the American people send ambassadors to other countries in the hope that they will report to the nation both the bright and dark sides of the country, that is, their strengths and weaknesses. Therefore, when he reported to the government on the difficulties faced by the British people, he spoke of both the strengths and weaknesses of Britain, because he wanted the government to obtain all possible information so that it could follow it in determining its foreign policy and not be restricted by the results of the war. He did not foresee the failure of Britain. The morale of the British people is indescribable. But what is known of the German war spirit and the German morale? If we do not know this, then the prediction of British failure is completely unconscious. Some people have accused him of being an appeaser, but in fact, the charge that he advocated compromise with the dictatorships is completely fabricated. The words of dictators have long been worthless. Hitler, who has unleashed the tide of war, has closed the door to peace to the world and declared total war in order to create a new world order. If this new order is established, it will be impossible for our just society to exist. Speaking of the possibility of Hitler declaring war on the United States, Kennedy said that in this era of rampant violence, undeclared war is prevalent. However, Hitler will wait until he believes the time is most advantageous before declaring war on the United States. The actions of the United States, in Hitler's view, are a violation of neutrality and sufficient reason to declare war on the United States. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Cables Congratulations</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to diplomatic sources, the 20th is the date of President Roosevelt's third inauguration. Chairman Lin of our country has sent a congratulatory telegram. The telegram reads, "On the joyous occasion of Your Excellency's third inauguration, I extend my sincere congratulations on behalf of the National Government and the people of the nation. Our two countries have long enjoyed friendly relations, and I deeply hope that during Your Excellency's tenure, our friendship will be further strengthened. I wish you good health and prosperity for your country." (19th telegram)</p>
<h3>Willkie Ordered to Britain for Investigation; Will Meet With Roosevelt Before Departure</h3>
<p>Washington - The White House announced yesterday that President Roosevelt has instructed Secretary of State Hull to convey all information regarding the European situation and American policy to Wendell Willkie, the former Republican presidential candidate who will be going to Britain to investigate the current situation. Tomorrow, Hull will meet with Willkie to exchange views. At that time, Hull will provide all kinds of information in accordance with the President's instructions. It is reported that Willkie is scheduled to depart for Britain on January 23. Willkie stated today that he intends to meet with President Roosevelt once before his departure. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday instructed Secretary of State Hull to inform Willkie of all the details of the government's foreign policy before Willkie goes to Britain. According to reliable sources, Willkie may be given a position in the government after he returns. On this point, the government side pointed out that former President Wilson appointed Taft as Attorney General after defeating Taft in 1913, which is a precedent. (International News Service, 19th)</p>
<h3>Secretary of the Navy Knox Delivers Speech; America's Aid to Democratic Countries Should Not Be Conditional</h3>
<p>New York - Secretary of the Navy Knox delivered a speech last night, stating that if the United States were to quibble about the conditions of aiding China, Britain, and Greece, it would be difficult to maintain its self-respect. The men, women, and children of Britain are all standing on the front lines of war for the principles upon which America's entire system of self-government is based. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington - Virginia Democratic Senator Glass stated yesterday that the United States should now declare war on Germany, and also stated that he personally "would like to see Hitler sink to the bottom of the sea." (19th telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Feels Apprehensive About America's Uncompromising Attitude</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japan Times and Guangzhi Report reported that the American people should make greater efforts to understand the position of other countries. An obstinate and uncompromising attitude will only make the already extremely dangerous situation more serious. The newspaper asked Secretary of State Hull that if the United States were in the same situation as Japan, could it have acted differently? It stated that looking at America's own policies is enough to make people surprised that America dares to criticize Japan so much. The newspaper also stated that the basis of the US-Japan conflict is the policy of interventionists. If the United States continues its policy of recognizing China as its first line of defense, there is probably no hope for friendly relations between the United States and Japan. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Reopens on Tuesday; Military and Political Authorities Met Yesterday to Exchange Views on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo - After the Diet officially reconvenes on Tuesday, a closed-door meeting will be held. At that time, Prime Minister Konoe, Army Minister Tojo, and Navy Minister Oikawa will secretly report on Japan's preparations in economic and naval and military affairs to cope with the serious international situation. Foreign Minister Matsuoka will present an overview of Japan's foreign relations over the past year at an open meeting. This meeting is the fifth meeting of the Japanese Diet since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, and also the first meeting after the abolition of the Japanese party system. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese military and political authorities held a meeting today that lasted for two hours. Foreign Minister Matsuoka, Army Minister Tojo, and Navy Minister Yoshida participated. The new ambassador to the United States, Nomura, and the new ambassador to Germany, Oshima, were also invited to attend. They exchanged views on the current situation. (Haitong Telegram, 19th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Congratulations to Mr. Roosevelt on His Inauguration as President for a Third Term</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt was elected to a third consecutive term last winter, and will be sworn in today in Congress. This ceremony, which breaks American historical precedent, is taking place at a time of extreme international turmoil. In addition to expressing our deep congratulations to the United States, we feel immense joy, and we firmly believe that President Roosevelt will be able to further express his ambitions during his next four-year term, and complete his great and immortal mission for the world and humanity.</p>
<p>According to American practice, there are two and a half months between the holding of the general election and the inauguration of the president. This is normally just a short process of transition between the old and the new, with no meaning to speak of. However, in today's desperate fight between aggression and anti-aggression, it has become a time object that both sides must compete for. The winter offensives prepared by the three allied countries in early winter last year were also aimed at the change of American president. However, thanks to the American people's ability to use reason to discern interests, the general election did not give the aggressive countries such an exploitable gap. On the contrary, the US government was able to further develop its established policy more actively because of Roosevelt's re-election. For example, the loan of 100 million yuan to China, the expansion of support for Britain and Greece, the increase of defense facilities in the Philippines and the Pacific, the independent construction of the two-ocean navy, President Roosevelt's fireside chats and congressional messages condemning aggression crimes, and the recent submission and discussion of the Lend-Lease Act, have all been continuously fired at the aggressors like a string of firecrackers during this period, making the aggressive countries feel unprecedentedly overstretched and disadvantaged. For example, France and Spain's refusal to join the Axis, Britain and Greece's great victories on both sides of the Mediterranean, and Japan's hesitation and indecision about advancing south are all directly and indirectly influenced by the firm US foreign policy. And these are all effects of the majority of American voters supporting Roosevelt's re-election. Of course, if the Republican Party had won this time, its future measures might not have differed much from the current policies of the US government. This is especially evident in Willkie's rejection of public opinion and support of Roosevelt's proposal to support China and Britain, which proves that wise men have the same views. However, if Roosevelt had lost, then at least during these two and a half months of transition, not only would there have been no way to prevent the aggressors from making adventurous attempts, but even some of the US's own national defense programs and foreign measures would have been hampered by the change of central leadership. The Japanese army's sudden attack on Shanhaiguan and Rehe at the end of 1932 took advantage of the opportunity of the transition of American heads of state. If this were to be a repeat of history, the upheaval would be even more comparable to Japan's occupation of Rehe and eastern Hebei. Today's various things are not only Roosevelt's success, but also the success of democratic politics.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's reputation and ambitions have undergone a universal and strict test in last winter's election. Although there were restrictions of historical precedent, attacks from enemy party members, and destruction from fifth columns, they did not reduce the American people's support and love for Roosevelt, and finally defeated his political enemies. And in fact, not only in the United States, but also among the talents of the world, Roosevelt is also an outstanding great leader. However, although Roosevelt has achieved these successes, his process of implementing policies is still not enough to cancel out the position adhered to by a small number of isolated individuals: the recent discussions in the US Congress on the Aid Bill are therefore caught in fierce debate. The spirit of holding on to the old and clinging to the outdated by those people can prove that everyone has ample opportunity to express his views under the democratic system, but in a time of crisis and upheaval, excessive adherence to personal prejudices is bound to hinder the smooth implementation of major tasks. Judging from the recent discussions on that bill, there is generally no problem that it will eventually be passed. The dispute is only about the president's authority to execute it and the scope of its application. Recently, Hull, Stimson, and Knox have attended the meetings together, shouting loudly, almost mobilizing the entire lineup of the American central government, and even President Roosevelt himself has had to indirectly engage in defense. This is an unnecessary waste forced by a small number of people. Even the time wasted here inevitably hinders the government's progress in various measures during this time. Our newspaper's editorial yesterday pointed out the possibility of the Axis powers launching an offensive before the American Aid Bill is established. Since the bill was submitted to Congress, the debate has lasted for ten days. Such a major national policy procedure should not be overly hasty, and ten days is not too long, but to be fair, is the spirit of democracy tied to the unnecessary stubbornness of a small number of people? We hope that the US Congress will not repeat the mistakes of causing delays in affairs at a time when the world is looking forward to it. We also sincerely hope that the American people can break various stubborn prejudices with the spirit of breaking historical traditions. All suggestions that limit the president's authority, the advocacy of solely supporting Britain, the fear of war, and the obstruction of transferring warships all contradict the original intention of the majority of American people to support Roosevelt, and should never be allowed to hinder the implementation of the authorities' great policies.</p>
<p>Now, the Far East and Europe are both brewing new turmoil, which will be the first issue that President Roosevelt will encounter after taking office. With his foresight and keen insight, we believe that he will be able to exert unparalleled power and continue and expand the clues that have already begun in the past few months, so that justice can be extended and atrocities can disappear. It is said that President Roosevelt's current physical condition and health are better than before, which is good news for all mankind, and also good news for justice, peace, and order!</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues Around Yichang; Chinese Army Quite Successful in Preventing Japanese Intrusion; Japanese Army's Southern Offensive in Qixian Repelled by Chinese</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to Chinese sources received here, the military activities that suddenly occurred around Yichang have resulted in fierce fighting, which is still ongoing. The Japanese army seems to have taken the offensive. A few days ago, it sent a team of 5,000 men and more than a dozen aircraft from Longquan Town, east of Yichang, to advance towards Longwangdong and Sanjialing (both transliterated). This Japanese army has been repelled. On January 17, the Japanese army sent a team and more than 20 aircraft to reinforce the attack, and the offensive began again. As a result of the fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered heavy losses. The battle is still ongoing. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Zhengzhou - On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army from Tongxu and Qixian counties gathered a unit, accompanied by 12 tanks and armored vehicles, to invade Nanyuegang, southeast of Tongxu. After Chinese interception, the Japanese suffered many casualties and retreated along the original route. (19th telegram)</p>
<p>Luoyang - On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army from Fotou and other places southwest of Jincheng invaded Nanling. After the army greeted and attacked, more than a hundred Japanese were killed. (19th telegram)</p>

<p>Luoyang - The Japanese army that was building a highway between Qinshui and Zhangzhuang (southeast of Jicheng) has been attacked by the Chinese army for days and has now stopped work. (19th telegram)</p>
<h3>Central Daily News and Sweeping Report Discuss the Dissolution of the New Fourth Army as a Decisive Means to Implement Military Orders; Unrelated to Politics and Other Troops</h3>
<p>Chongqing - This morning, the Central Daily News and the Sweeping Report commented on the handling of the New Fourth Army, saying that this was a decisive measure that had to be taken to implement military orders and maintain military discipline, and had nothing to do with politics, and was completely unrelated to other troops. Even in the New Fourth Army, this decision to rebel was only the conspiracy of one or two unscrupulous officers and had nothing to do with all the soldiers. The general public deeply believes that discipline is the guarantee of victory in the War of Resistance, so they all support the authorities' measures. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - All newspapers here have published the official announcement of the dissolution of the New Fourth Army in Anhui Province, and all have published this news in an important position. The Social Worker's Newspaper said that from the perspective of unified command and military discipline, this harsh measure is correct. We hope that the Supreme Command will continue to enforce strict discipline in all troops, and other troops should pay attention to this warning. The Central Daily News emphasizes the importance of wartime military discipline, and mentions Han Fuqu and Shi Yousan, who were executed for conspiracy. The newspaper added that Ye Ting has now been arrested, and Xiang Ying will also be hard to escape. This matter seems to have come to an end. This action has nothing to do with politics or other Chinese troops. The entire responsibility rests with Ye Ting and other few people. We deeply appreciate the central government's move, which is fully supported by the people of the country. The Sweeping Report, the mouthpiece of the army, expressed regret for the conspiracy of the New Fourth Army leaders. According to the news of the dissolution of the New Fourth Army, diplomatic figures from various countries had heard about it a few days ago, and originally thought that the opinions of both sides could be resolved without bloodshed, so they were quite disappointed. The Soviet Embassy has been the site of diplomatic activities for the past few days, and it is quite sensitive to the reaction to this unexpected event. The Communist Party's mouthpiece, Xinhua Daily, published two texts written by Zhou Enlai. The first was a notice to commemorate those who died in Jiangnan, and the second was a simple text stating that the New Fourth Army was wrong, but had no intention of rebelling. The newspaper did not publish an editorial or the spokesman of the Military Commission's statement explaining this unexpected event. The government authorities here are certain that the measures taken to deal with the New Fourth Army are purely disciplinary, not political, and have nothing to do with the Communist principles of the army. They also expressed their deep belief that this harsh measure will soon be satisfactorily concluded. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>Full Text of Hull's Speech (Continued and Completed)</h3>
<p>Controlling the Seas, Ensuring Security</p>
<p>Adhering to international law and respecting the freedom of the seas is the way to ensure the security of the Western Hemisphere under the current world situation. If the high seas were controlled by the signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact, the danger to our country would be many times greater than it is today. People often say that the New World is in no danger of aggression, and that the Germans cannot even cross the English Channel, so how could they cross the Atlantic? But if there were no well-equipped Britain, engaged in war every single day to prevent Germany from crossing the English Channel, and if Britain had no precise defense plans to resist a German landing, the Germans could cross the English Channel in an hour. It must be understood that this 20-mile expanse of water between the European continent and Britain is controlled by the British, not by the Germans. If Britain were defeated and lost control of the seas, unless we could do what Britain is currently doing, Germany could cross the Atlantic, especially the South Atlantic. If the Atlantic were controlled by Germany, the Atlantic would no longer provide us with any security. Under such circumstances, to ensure the security of our entire nation, we would need to devote a large part of our efforts and wealth to national defense production, extend universal military service, implement extremely burdensome taxes, maintain constant vigilance on our borders to guard against enemies, and become completely entangled in power diplomacy. If such were the case, all of the above would become necessary. Today, Britain is a true fortress, and when America's armed defense preparations are complete, America will be as well. But in fact, it seems that an ideal aggressor would not adopt a direct frontal attack to conquer America. If such people have an opportunity to invade, we dare say that the aggressor would first invade other countries in the Western Hemisphere that are more vulnerable than America, and then invade America. Destructive forces are currently at work in many American countries, striving to create international disputes and divisions. Such actions are now well-known as the prelude to armed aggression. These forces are now being sanctioned and actively eliminated. However, if control of the high seas falls into the hands of an ideal attacker, the entire situation will change. Under such circumstances, due to the difficulty of continental defense, the effort we expend will be greater than we want to use at this time. The most serious problem facing the United States today is whether the United States will allow control of the high seas to fall into the hands of countries that only seek unlimited conquest. Therefore, we should today correct our concepts and actions regarding the issue of preparing material assistance for Britain.</p>
<p>Material Assistance to Invaded Countries</p>
<p>The public policy issue that is today most unanimously valued and emphasized by the people of our country is none other than the issue of giving the greatest possible material assistance to Britain and other invaded countries within the shortest possible period of time, for our own most important interests. The reason for this is that it is now completely obvious that resisting the aggressor with this assistance is the most important part of our self-defense. At a time when aggressive forces are rampant in the world, if we want to determine a wise and prudent national policy, we must consider self-defense. If we do not provide assistance to the invaded, the result will not be to restore peace, but only to permanently enslave the already invaded countries, and give the aggressor the opportunity to gather strength to attack us. The leaders of the armies we are now confronting with the tools of self-defense have fundamentally abandoned the long-standing peaceful and orderly international relations. They disregard all the rights of neutral countries, even the rights they have personally and solemnly guaranteed not to violate. The tools they often use to rule their unfortunate victims are unreasonable terror, killing, fraud, forced labor, confiscation of property, concentration camps, and various other forms of exploitation. Peaceful countries today have much confidence in the concept of law, protection, and many well-intentioned, law-abiding countries have been destroyed. I am certain that a day will come when countries that themselves despise and disregard the principles of the rule of law will have no opportunity to demand that the countries they want to harm strictly abide by those principles, until the enemy is at the gates of the city. But as long as such countries exist, we must not change our determination due to their threats or protests, but must at any time create various methods and conditions necessary for our own security and self-defense. The current bill will establish an institution that will enable us to most effectively use our resources for our own needs and the needs of those we decide to assist for self-defense. The biggest problem with democracy is to quickly and completely organize and use its power. The bill now proposed is a necessary way to achieve this goal. This bill will enable us to allocate our resources in the most well-calculated way, in order to ensure the safety of the United States and the Americas in the face of the many dangers that lie ahead. Most importantly, it will enable us to accomplish everything in the fastest way. Speed is what we need most today.</p>
<p>Citing Treaties, Answering Inquiries</p>
<p>After the presentation was completed, someone asked Hull how the bill would affect domestic and international law? Hull replied by citing various treaties and laws as follows: (1) The Johnson Act. This law seems unlikely to be affected, as it does not apply to the U.S. government or public corporations established under special authorization from Congress, or companies in which the U.S. government holds significant interests, such as the Export-Import Bank. (2) The Public Law of 1939. Section 7 of this law prohibits loans or credit to belligerent countries, but according to its wording, it does not apply to the U.S. government, but it may apply to companies such as the Export-Import Bank. In any case, this provision will be replaced by the new law regarding the actions of the U.S. government. (2) Section 23 of Title 18 of the Federal Code prohibits ships in the United States from being armed for use by a belligerent country against a country or nation with which the United States is not at war. Section 24 of this law prohibits warships or armed vessels of belligerent countries from increasing or building up their military strength in U.S. ports. Section 33 of this law prohibits the surrender of any military vessel from the United States to a belligerent country during a war in which the United States remains neutral. The above provisions will be replaced by the new law. The Hague Convention of 1907, the 13th Hague Convention of 1907, stipulates in Article 6 that neutral countries are prohibited from directly or indirectly supplying belligerent countries with warships, ordnance or military materials in any way. Article 17 stipulates that warships of belligerent countries may carry out repairs necessary for navigation in neutral ports, but may not increase their combat power in any way. Article 18 stipulates that warships of belligerent countries may not use neutral ports to replenish or increase their military materials or weapons. This convention cannot be applied to the current European war, because Article 28 stipulates, "This convention shall not apply except between contracting powers, and then only if all the belligerents are parties to the convention." Britain and Italy did not participate in this convention, or it is said that the Federal Code and the Hague Convention cited above state the principles of international law regarding the above question. If we do the things imagined by the new law, we will destroy neutrality. This view is largely correct under normal circumstances, but what we are dealing with is not an ordinary situation, but an extraordinary situation.</p>
<p>Neutrality is a Mistake</p>
<p>The rules regarding the rights and obligations of neutral countries, and the rules regarding the rights and obligations of belligerent countries, are reciprocal, that is, the so-called belligerent countries must not engage in certain acts that infringe on the rights of neutral countries, and neutral countries must not engage in certain acts that impede the rights of belligerent countries. For example, Article 1 of the Hague Convention stipulates that belligerent countries must respect the sovereignty of neutral countries, and must not engage in any act within the territory or territorial waters of neutral countries that would constitute a violation of neutrality. Belligerent countries must also not use neutral seaports and territorial waters as bases for warships and submarines to fight against enemies (Article 5). Germany and Italy do not pay attention to these provisions that represent international law, and arbitrarily occupy the territories of neutral countries by force without notice, and after conquering these countries, they use the resources of these conquered countries to attack hostile countries. One of these countries, such as Belgium, concluded a formal treaty with Germany on May 1, 1939, in which both parties agreed never to resort to force in any event. And Norway, like Norway, obtained a guarantee from the German government on September 1, 1939, which stated that Germany would never violate Norway's inviolability and political integrity, and that Germany would respect Norway's territorial integrity. These agreements or neutral laws cannot serve as a guarantee for Norway, Belgium and other countries, but provide belligerent countries with the convenience of invading their land. Apart from force, there is no other way to stop these belligerent countries from conquering other countries by means of aggression. The purpose of these belligerent countries to conquer the world has already been boldly declared. These people have already acknowledged that their philosophy is contrary to the philosophy of democratic countries, and firmly believe that democracy is outdated and must be replaced by these people to fulfill their requirements for organizing international relations. We feel in our hearts that certain facts have occurred, and are continuing to occur, and are continuing to occur before our eyes. If we continue to use neutral laws as the standard, or feel that neutral laws can give us a minimum of security or guarantee, it is a waste of effort. Only by paying attention to the actual concepts of the current situation can we have a sound concept. Therefore, the question of neutrality, I have made it clear, becomes an illusion once it is obstructed by ambitious aggressors. Apart from the question of neutrality, there is a recognized principle that is older than any neutral law, that is, the right of a country to defend itself against threats from within and without. This is an element of national sovereignty, and is also recognized by the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. We may be able to learn that these aggressors have no intention of invading the Western Hemisphere, but some countries that have been occupied by force by these people have been given guarantees by the aggressors. These guarantees are all empty words. Therefore, we cannot rely on these guarantees to delay the completion of our national defense until we can determine what the actual psychology of these aggressors is. Some conquered countries and other unconquered countries all have territories in the Western Hemisphere. Should we not assume that if circumstances permit, these territories could be occupied by these aggressor countries, or be used as bases by these aggressor countries to complete their attempts to conquer the world? We are fully aware that it is legitimate to supply military supplies to countries that are directly defending themselves and indirectly defending us against the invasion of those who are determined to conquer other countries by force. We are now only trying to defend ourselves against a situation that we did not create. What we are doing our best to do is to prevent this situation from happening. (United Press)</p>

<h3>Japan Pays Heavy Price for War of Aggression Against China: Overseas Trade Plummets, Gold Flows Out, Treasury Exhausted</h3>
<p>Washington, D.C. According to neutral economists and international affairs experts speaking to a United Press reporter, Japan has paid a heavy price in terms of gold and losses in trade and shipping for its war in China. If the war in the Far East continues for a long time, there may be continuous and significant sacrifices. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937, the amount of gold worth US$700,000,000 flowing into the United States from Japan is only one indication of this price. Japan's alliance with the Axis powers has not only failed to reduce its economic burden, but has increased it, because neither Germany nor Italy can maintain a "supply and demand" commercial relationship with this Far Eastern empire, while this Far Eastern empire can provide Germany and Italy with economic assistance in terms of goods or services. Japan has stopped publishing international trade statistics for various countries, perhaps due to military reasons. The overall report of its trade with the mainland can reportedly only be obtained upon special request. Its total amount of monetary reserves was once reported to be 501,000,000 yen. It is widely believed that this is a superficial figure, because part of this amount may have been allocated for domestic affairs. Because there is no count or index of international economic activity to observe, it is difficult to guess how Japan can afford the cost of the war on the Asian continent. Most of Japan's exports must be exported to countries in the so-called yen bloc, and most of Japan's required imports must come from countries outside the yen bloc. This is a definite fact. Japan's abandonment of many sea voyages and transportation in order to carry out its necessary military transportation is also an indirect factor in its significant losses. As a result, Japan had to replace imported goods with domestic goods to the extent possible, and cause the standard of living to generally decline. How long can this situation in Japan last? It will likely depend on its ability to requisition its manpower and financial resources, its ability to organize new industries, and the extent to which it can expand trade to countries where there is no foreign exchange problem. Official statistics in the United States have shown some indicators, although not very accurate, are sufficient to know the terrible economic price that Japan has paid for building its New Order in East Asia. In 1935, Japan's foreign trade reached a high level throughout the year, and its industrial production also reached its peak that year. At that time, Japan purchased raw materials from foreign markets at extremely low prices, produced them at low wages, and used its own shipping to actively move towards the status of an industrially self-sufficient and international commercial country, while the United States at that time was a good market for Japan's silk and manufactured goods. Less than two years later, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred in July 1937. Since then, Japan has purchased countless industrial raw materials and equipment for military purposes, and most of its regular economy has also become to meet the needs of the war. As a result, Japan felt a great deficit in its trade balance with the United States. As a result, a large amount of Japan's gold flowed into the United States. In 1937, the gold flowing into the United States from Japan, calculated at US$35 per ounce of pure gold, totaled US$346,500,000. In 1938, the gold flowing into the United States was worth a total of US$168,700,000. In 1939, the gold flowing into the United States was worth US$169,600,000. In the first eleven months of 1940, the total value of gold flowing into the United States was US$98,400,000. There may be more flowing in the future, because commercial statistics still show that a large amount of American goods are being shipped to Japan, exceeding the amount purchased from Japan. In the first ten months of 1940, the goods shipped from the United States to Japan were worth US$191,413,000, compared to US$179,377,000 in the same period in 1939. This year, the number of American wood fiber raw materials, petroleum, iron blocks, steel, copper, and metal machinery purchased by Japan has increased significantly. In the first ten months of 1940, the goods imported from Japan by the United States were worth US$122,667,000, compared to US$125,312,000 in the previous year. (United Press Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>The Painful History of the European War (8): Recollections of the Disorganized Anglo-French Front</h3>
<p>The goal of terrifying civilians through the shelling of Sui-Ji was surprisingly successful. Later, I discovered that in every village, there was a plainclothes agent of German or Belgian origin. As soon as a bomb landed, they would tell people: "Escape while you still can! The village will be razed to the ground, and the German secret police will follow the German planes here. You know how they treat the Poles!"</p>
<p>The residents, believing these falsehoods, fled en masse, including the village head, priests, officials, and ordinary people. The refugees along the road resembled a surging tide, a truly grand spectacle. First came the cars of the wealthy, the chauffeurs wearing gloves and fashionable hats; then the middle class, driving their own cars with bedding tied to the roofs; followed by horse-drawn carts carrying entire families; and finally, groups of pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
<p>No contagion spreads more easily than panic during an evacuation. As the wave of people near the French border passed through each village and town, the residents of those places joined the exodus. Our excellent mechanized units had to struggle to weave their way through the human tide on the first day.</p>
<p>However, there had never been such chaos in the 1914 war, not even when the Amiens front was breached. Why? Because today's terror is far greater than in 1914; because someone is deliberately spreading rumors that penetrate deeply into people's minds, so that even a patriotic person who forgets their family will abandon everything to escape this immense danger; because most farmers were poorly informed in 1914 and remained ignorant, but now they are awakened by the alarming news announced on the radio; and because the German air force has an absolute numerical advantage, making them believe they are completely defenseless.</p>
<p>To prevent them from fleeing, the military and political authorities would need immense resolve to forbid anyone from abandoning their homes and to position machine guns on rooftops to show a defensive posture. Moreover, only sending more fighter planes to patrol the skies over Belgium could stop these people and force them to stay put. Unfortunately, the authorities themselves were swept along by the tide, and there were no machine guns or planes to be seen. Everyone was enveloped in terror and had no avenue for appeal, so they fled aimlessly and without order.</p>
<p>This unprecedented chaos not only made it impossible to execute orders, but also brought misfortune, as the orders were never issued in time. The commander-in-chief and fifteen generals were summarily dismissed. General Weygand came from Syria, far away, but was delayed by wind and rain en route. General Billotte, commanding the northern forces, although facing a formidable enemy, was both courageous and insightful, and tried to hold the line. Unfortunately, he died in a car accident at the critical moment. His successor, General Blanchard, was no less capable than Billotte, but because he took over so hastily, he lacked coordination with his troops and had to command the battle in the most unfavorable circumstances.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Good fortune never comes in pairs, but misfortune never comes alone." A series of accidents and failures followed one after another, creating such a massive disaster that every time one thinks of it, one must consider the god of fate, sighing at the cruelty of creation when unexpected tragedies occur.</p>
<p>I was in the British General Staff when they received news that the Germans had broken through at Sedan and that Corap's army had collapsed. However, the British side concealed this information for two days, whether out of caution or cowardice, I do not know. The war reports were still carefully worded and vague, but I could easily see that something was being hidden. They immediately stopped talking when they saw me enter the room. Orders for retreat had also been issued. Only at the very end did the British side tell me what they knew.</p>
<p>The German breakthrough of our lines was swift and thorough, a result of concentrated attacks, surprise, and terror tactics. Thousands of flamethrower tanks and thousands of strangely noisy planes surrounded and attacked Corap's army. Even the bravest men would find it difficult to hold their ground in the face of such an unexpected and unprepared assault.</p>
<p>The most powerful German tanks had thick armor that could not be penetrated by artillery shells, which dismayed the French soldiers. The steel plates made by the Škoda armaments factory were exceptionally strong. Hitting them with our artillery shells was like a dragonfly trying to shake a stone pillar; there was no hope of damaging them. The French artillery was clever enough to discover that their 75mm guns could be used as direct-fire guns if handled properly, but this was only a temporary expedient, not an organized defense method.</p>
<p>In mid-May, the French were asking each other, "How did the Germans cross the Meuse River? Were there no mines buried under the bridges?" At the time, rumors were circulating in the British army that German paratroopers and spies had shot the soldiers responsible for blowing up the bridges, and that the number of mines buried was insufficient. Moreover, the German mechanized units received great help from plainclothes agents when they passed through the Ardennes Forest, which allowed them to advance at a terrifying speed, catching Corap's army by surprise.</p>
<p>A tragic and moving event unfolded on the Meuse River. British and French pilots were ordered to sacrifice themselves to destroy the designated bridges. One squadron each of British and French bombers volunteered to give their lives for their country. The French planes went first, flying lower, followed by the British planes. I never received a report on the number of French losses, but I know that of the sixty British planes, forty were missing.</p>
<p>There are countless other similar stories, showing that the Allied forces were not without courage. It is a great fallacy to say that the Allied forces were demoralized and incapable of fighting from the beginning of the war. But like microorganisms, they are ineffective against a healthy body, but if the body is weakened by fatigue and worry, the microorganisms will seize the opportunity to wreak havoc. The morale of the Allied forces was not very strong to begin with, and once they saw that their equipment was inadequate, they inevitably declined rapidly.</p>
<p>After the defeat at Sedan, the belief that the enemy would win spread everywhere, and retreating troops used this as an excuse. The news of the enemy's mechanized units arriving preceded their actual arrival, clearing the way for them. After the enemy broke through at Sedan, they turned west to attack the Allied forces in the north. At the time, I was in the British General Staff, which moved to Arras to avoid being surrounded. Arras was filled with rumors: "The Germans are already at such-and-such a place..." These rumors, of course, were later proven true, but at the time they were just rumors. However, one person told ten, and ten told a hundred, and in an instant, men, women, old, and young fled in panic. Even the military authorities were alarmed and suspicious, ordering their troops to retreat to the coast, where they were eventually captured by the enemy.</p>
<p>It is true that German paratroopers were active in the Netherlands and Belgium, but the terrifying rumors only served to enhance the enemy's prestige and increase their effectiveness tenfold. Farmers and soldiers suspected everyone of being disguised. Priests were no longer believed to be real priests, and even uniformed officers were suspected of being impostors. Telephones and telegrams were all regarded with suspicion.</p>
<p>These fantastic rumors spread even faster than the German Messerschmitt fighters. This explains why small enemy units were able to occupy important towns without bloodshed. A small number of well-equipped and courageous mechanized units would often rush into train stations, kill a few station staff, and disrupt train traffic. In reality, these station staff were capable of defending themselves and were obligated to do so. I once met a group of British engineers wielding shovels and axes who slaughtered the members of the enemy's motorcycle reconnaissance team, leaving no one alive.</p>
<p>The defense of Arras by the Welsh infantry and a small number of French light infantry also served as a model for covering operations. I saw these soldiers, assisted by the French officer Premier, calmly set up defensive lines. The entrances to the city were barricaded with barbed wire, sandbags, and machine guns and direct-fire guns were placed in ambush. When German tanks came, they destroyed several of them, and the rest caught fire. The enemy was blocked and could not find a gap to exploit around the city. The brave and effective defense of the city lasted for a week, before finally retreating to Dunkirk.</p>
<p>If this kind of excellence could be found in all armies, General Weygand would have been able to launch a counterattack, close the gap between Arras and Bapaume, and cut off the German rear. Unfortunately, the public was fleeing in panic, order was chaotic, reserves were lacking, transportation routes were destroyed, and the Allied General Staff collapsed due to enemy air activity. Even if there had been brilliant plans, they could not be implemented and ultimately came to naught. The speed with which German spies obtained information was truly mysterious and unbelievable. When a commanding general arrived in a village, enemy planes would often come to bomb before he had even settled in. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>German Troops Concentrate in the Balkans to Prevent a New British Offensive; No Incidents Expected Soon; Turkish Government Prepares for Air Defense</h3>
<p>Istanbul: The Akşam newspaper here reports that the German troop concentration in the Balkans aims to prevent British forces from transferring large sea, land, and air units from North Africa to Salonica in Greece. Germany believes that if Italy is defeated in Libya, the British will open a new front against Germany in the Balkans. Therefore, the German troops are merely preventing the collapse of Italy and a new British offensive, not any changes regarding the Soviet Union, nor purely to aid Italy, as it is too late for that. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Budapest: Balkan observers believe that there will be no special activity in the Balkans for at least several weeks. Their belief is based on climatic conditions (yesterday's electrical storm was intense). Secondly, the Balkans are merely one of the European theaters. Hungarian newspapers yesterday prominently published the news that the British sweeper HMS Sambourne was sunk near Sicily by a German ship, and emphasized that the German army had an important air base in the south. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: News here today is that the Turkish government is currently preparing a law that will allow the government to requisition all wooden houses. The purpose of this law is to prevent air raids, but it is not known whether the Turkish government will demolish the houses due to their flammability, or merely evacuate the residents. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland: Diplomatic sources report that Hitler and Mussolini had important talks over the weekend, and considerable large-scale German-Italian actions are expected to arise from these. It is reported that senior officials of both also participated in the meeting. The main issue discussed was the joint Axis actions in the Mediterranean. It is also reported that the two have agreed on a more definite attitude towards the US proposal for "full" aid to Britain. The French issue is also said to be on the agenda. Observers believe that the meeting, held on the eve of President Roosevelt's inauguration, is undoubtedly of great significance. Diplomatic observers predict that Germany and Italy will quickly put pressure on France, with the aim of obtaining French naval bases and warships for Axis use. As for the possibility of attacking Gibraltar via Spain, attacking Greece from the Balkans, or even starting a war with Turkey, these may also materialize in the near future.

<h3>North African Dust Storms Hinder Fighting; British Air Force Attacks Italian Bases; Italian Bombers Strike Suez Canal Area</h3>
<p>Cairo: It was announced here today that just as strong winds and dust storms have brought land fighting to a standstill, British air force bombers have again launched destructive attacks on the Italian port of Tobruk and other Italian bases in North Africa, causing heavy losses. It is claimed that the British bomber groups flew to their destinations against adverse winds and air currents, launching a long attack on Tobruk, causing two major fires and eleven explosions. Other bombers reportedly raided the heavily defended Italian coastal base of Derna, "with large numbers of bombs hitting army barracks." (International News Service dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Cairo: An RAF communique states that on Thursday night, British planes bombed Tobruk, causing two major fires and ten major explosions in the town. That night, they also bombed the airfields of Derna, Martuba, and Rhodes, the Caproni factory in Madagascar, the motor vehicle depot in Assab, a transport ship near Bardia, and the artillery positions in Solum. Italian planes dropped several bombs in the Alexandria and Suez Canal areas on Friday, but damage was minimal and there were no casualties. Also on Thursday night, they raided a British air force camp in Sidi Haneish, dropping many bombs, but there was no major damage. (United Press dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Cairo: The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior issued a communique yesterday stating that enemy planes flew to the Suez Canal area at midnight on Friday, dropping a few bombs, causing no damage to life or property.

<p>Rome: An Italian communique states that in East Africa, Italian planes bombed British bases in Upper Sudan, the Aroma railway station, and troops and armored units in the Maughers area. The Italian bases of Massawa and Assab were attacked by British planes. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Greek Troops Continue to Advance in Albania; Greeks Sink Italian Troop Transport</h3>
<p>Athens: According to an official spokesman here, Greek troops continued to advance on the central sector of the Albanian front, occupying important heights and capturing large quantities of military supplies. There were also patrol activities in other areas, and many Italian soldiers were captured. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters special correspondent reports from the Albanian border that after fierce fighting around Moschopolis in the central sector of the Albanian front, Greek troops have occupied several high points in the Ostravicë mountain range, but their advance has now been checked by Italian troops. There is artillery fire in the Devolli River valley, but no troop movements on either side. In the Qesarakë River valley, Greek troops advanced briefly but were forced to retreat to their original positions by an Italian counterattack. Fighting is continuing in this area. Greek patrols now control the area around Lin on the shores of Lake Ohrid. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek sources announce that on Friday, Greek troops charged into Italian positions, surrounded Italian troops, and captured 1,000 soldiers from the famous "Lupi di Toscana" division.

(Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Greek Navy Department implied last night that the Greek submarine Proteus, which sank an Italian troop transport in the Adriatic Sea 21 days ago, has been lost. An official statement said that the submarine, weighing 700 tons and carrying 41 officers and men, has not returned to its base since sinking the Italian ship. (International News Service dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian High Command announced that heavy snow on the Greek front is hindering military activities. (Transocean News Service dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Malta Attacked Again</h3>

<p>Berlin: German dive bombers and ordinary bombers, escorted by German and Italian fighters, flew to Malta yesterday to bomb it for several hours. Hangars, barracks, and warehouses everywhere were bombed and destroyed, with fires breaking out in many places. In the ensuing air battle, one British Hurricane fighter was shot down. Two German planes did not return to their bases. (Transocean News Service dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German authorities have declared that German planes lost one plane each in attacks on British fleets in the Mediterranean and on Malta. British claims of shooting down 12 and 10 German planes respectively are utterly unfounded. (Transocean News Service dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>British Planes Have Raided Germany 900 Times Since the Start of the European War; Industrial Areas and Ports Have Been Heavily Bombed; Germany Also Shells British Escort Convoy</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters aviation correspondent reports that the British bombing of German military targets continues unabated. Though the weather is unfavorable for flying, the scope of British air raids this winter has not diminished. According to records released by the Ministry of Information yesterday, British planes raided Germany a total of 900 times from the start of the war to the end of summer. Of these, 700 raids were carried out in the three months of July, August, and September. In the three months from early October to New Year's Day, British planes carried out a total of 500 raids. In the most recent three months, the weather has often limited British planes to bombing German-occupied territories. On January 1 this year, British planes carried out their first daylight raid on the Krupp factory in Cologne. Judging from specially prepared maps, the bombing by British planes was very accurate. In the last quarter of last year, the Ruhr industrial area suffered many air raids. Although the Germans have made every effort to relocate factories in the Ruhr area to the east, the Ruhr remains the center of German war production, with the town of Essen, where the Krupp factory is located, being the most important, followed by the Mannheim and Leipzig areas. All of these areas, which produce the most German military equipment, have been bombed by British planes, with thousands of tons of bombs dropped. Most of the aviation fuel used by the German air force and the machine oil used by German submarines are produced in the Leipzig area. It is estimated that nine-tenths of Germany's oil production has been attacked by British planes. According to statistics, 270 German cities and towns have been attacked. Among them, the hardest hit are the shipping areas of northern Germany. The two largest German ports, Hamburg and Bremen, have each been raided 61 times and 52 times respectively as of January 4. The naval bases of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven and Emden have also been raided 30 to 40 times. Bremen, Germany's best base for submarines and aircraft, was attacked three nights in a row during the first week of this year. British planes have raided Berlin 35 times, but British planes have not attacked since the night of December 20. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>London: Last night, German bombers did not appear over the British Isles, possibly due to winter gales in the English Channel. However, Nazi artillery heavily shelled Dover this morning. As the British retaliated, the German shelling gradually subsided. The artillery battle followed a brief daylight raid on London. Rescue workers in Swansea are taking advantage of a brief lull to rescue victims from the ruins of the fire-bombing blitz on Friday night. The British Isles have also begun to convene more commanders to discuss defense, to conscript service personnel, and to prevent communist activity. Yesterday, King George signed the first Privy Council order in British history, making compulsory defense service for men aged 16 to 60. Home Secretary Morrison said that the order is currently intended to make them serve in extinguishing incendiary bombs. It is claimed that British women will soon be forced to perform this service as well. Everyone will be forced to guard against fire for 48 hours each month, especially in commercial organizations and factories. Those who desert will be severely punished. It is understood that Minister of Labour Bevin has completed drafting a secret plan to utilize nationwide compulsory service. The plan will be announced on Tuesday. It is also understood that the plan will include fine-tuning dock workers, etc., and concentrating efforts to meet escort convoys and immediately unload goods. It is hinted that this construction project will be nationalized. (International News Service dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>London: The British Air Ministry revealed last night that the British Air Force recently launched another daylight bombing of German ships in the English Channel. One German ship was sunk, and three others were hit by bombs. (International News Service dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin: It has just been learned from authoritative sources that German long-range artillery shelled a British escort convoy near Dover port from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. yesterday. (Transocean News Service dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Two British Minesweeping Fishing Vessels Lost; No Casualties Among Crew</h3>
<p>A British Admiralty communiqué states that the British naval minesweeping fishing vessels HMS Chestnut and HMS Expectation have both been lost. There were no casualties among the crews of either ship. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>German-Italian Economic Talks to Be Held in Rome; German Delegation Scheduled to Arrive in Italy</h3>
<p>Rome: It has been officially announced that Germany and Italy will hold an important meeting tomorrow to discuss all issues related to economic relations. (United Press dispatch, 19th) Rome: German-Italian economic talks will begin in Rome early next week and are expected to last about two weeks. Dr. Clodius, a cabinet member of the German Department of Unconcern, will arrive here on Sunday with 35 experts. Although the holding of these talks is nothing out of the ordinary for the regular meetings between Germany and Italy, responsible sources here say that no meeting has been as important as this one since the establishment of the February 1940 commercial agreement. The topics to be discussed include transportation issues and the relations between the Axis powers and the occupied territories. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>Liu Dajun and Economics</h3>
<p>— Zhu Tongjiu</p>
<p>(1) Purpose of Drafting this Article</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yifan telegraphed, requesting that I write an article rich in suggestions for the "Shen Bao" Economics Special Issue. Without thinking, I immediately agreed. However, after careful consideration, drafting an article is easy, but writing one that is full of suggestions is as difficult as climbing to the heavens. If I were to write carelessly, I fear it would disgrace the reputation of the publication. So, I reviewed the recently published articles in the "Shen Bao" Economics Special Issue. Most of them discussed economic systems or economic problems, while articles reviewing economics itself were as rare as morning stars. I surmise that due to the rising cost of living in Shanghai recently, writers are focusing all their efforts on immediate life problems in order to cope with the environment. They have no time to attend to economics that is abstract in principle. This is probably a natural trend and nothing to be surprised about. However, while racking my brains, I suddenly remembered Liu Dajun, one of the two leading economic figures in our country. He dedicated his life to economics, initiated and organized the Chinese Economic Society, and encouraged young scholars to engage in in-depth research on economics. His contributions to the progress of economics in our country resonated with those of Mr. Ma Yinchu. This year marks his 50th birthday. I am taking this opportunity to use the space of the Economics Special Issue to describe the relationship between Mr. Liu Dajun and economics, and to promote the historical facts of the progress of economics in our country. This is something that the Economics Special Issue should disclose. Mr. Liu Dajun has studied economics all his life and has always advised government authorities on how to develop our national economy. This also fits with what Mr. Yifan called being rich in suggestions. It is a win-win situation and feels very appropriate. Therefore, this article can be regarded as a congratulatory message for Mr. Liu Dajun's birthday, or as an article full of suggestions.</p>
<p>(2) Brief Biography and Works of Mr. Liu Dajun</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Dajun's high position in the academic world is well known to all domestic researchers of economics and statistics. Even foreign researchers in the United States and Britain who study the Chinese economy invariably cite the figures disclosed in his works as supporting evidence for their arguments. However, when discussing economic authorities, other sectors in the country often praise Mr. Ma Yinchu. But fewer people are familiar with Mr. Liu Dajun. After examining the reasons for this, there are two points to consider: First, most of Mr. Liu Dajun's works are written in English, while most of Mr. Ma Yinchu's works are published in Chinese. Therefore, Chinese people read more of Ma's works because of the language. Second, Mr. Liu Dajun spends most of his time organizing statistical figures and presiding over survey work. There are fewer public speeches to the public. Mr. Ma Yinchu, on the other hand, has been giving public speeches everywhere in the past ten years, and has had more opportunities to meet with the public. Now, in order to familiarize all sectors with Mr. Liu's contributions to the academic world, Mr. Liu's brief biography and works are described as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Dajun studied engineering at the University of Michigan in the United States. Later, he majored in economics and became a prominent student of the famous American economist Professor Dayler. After returning to China, he first taught at Tsinghua University. Currently, the well-known domestic economists Xiao Ju, Chen Zong, and Li Quanshi, etc., once received their blessings from his rostrum. Later, he assisted Mr. Turner in presiding over the Beijing Economic Discussion Office to conduct surveys on the economic situation in various parts of China, and compiled various economic statistics, and published two kinds of Chinese and Western economic publications. The work of economic survey in our country began with this. Therefore, Mr. Liu is worthy of being called the pioneer of economic survey work in our country. Later, Mr. Liu also invited Professor Dairen of Yenching University, as well as the well-known economists Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, Chen Da, and Ma Yinchu to organize the Chinese Economic Society. All the members elected Mr. Liu as the president, and he spared no effort in promoting the study of economics and conducting economic surveys. He made great contributions to making the people of the country pay significant attention to economic undertakings. After the success of the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Hu Hanmin, the president of the Legislative Yuan, admired Mr. Liu's reputation and hired Mr. Liu as the director of the Statistics Department of the Legislative Yuan. Later, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics was established, and he served as the director of the Bureau of Statistics, planning the promotion of national statistical work. He planned carefully. During this period, in order to promote the interest of the Chinese people in the study of statistics, Mr. Liu also initiated the organization of the Chinese Statistical Society, and Mr. Liu was also elected as the president. Therefore, the current considerable achievements in statistical work in our country seem to be attributed to Mr. Liu's promotion. After Mr. Liu was re-appointed to go abroad to investigate the world's statistical undertakings, he realized that the relationship between economics and statistics was very close. Therefore, he initiated the joint establishment of the Chinese Economic Statistics Research Institute by the Chinese Economic Society and the Chinese Statistical Society. Both societies unanimously elected Mr. Liu as the director of the institute. Not long after the establishment of the institute, the government entrusted the institute to investigate the national industry. After more than two years, the national industrial survey was completed, and three volumes of the "Chinese Industrial Survey Report" were compiled, which is the greatest of our country's survey work and is often admired by the academic community. Before the war, Mr. Liu was also entrusted by the central government to plan and promote the National Economic Construction Movement, and made great contributions. Even the four slogans of the National Economic Construction Movement: "Everyone uses their talents, the land uses its benefits, everything uses its use, and goods flow freely," were written by Mr. Liu. Currently, Mr. Liu is the director of the National Economic Research Institute, studying planned economies.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Liu's published works in recent years, the important ones include the following books:</p>

<p>(3) Mr. Liu Dajun's Scholarship</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Dajun's method of studying economics is roughly the same as the quantitative analysis method adopted by Professor Mitchell of Columbia University in the United States. However, the statistical undertaking in the United States has already been developed. Various economic statistics have been compiled by the government or private organizations. Professor Mitchell can engage in analysis after collecting the various economic statistics he needs. However, the statistical undertaking in our country remains to be developed. Therefore, before starting research, Mr. Liu must also take on the task of land reclamation, and first engage in economic survey matters. Therefore, although Mr. Liu's method of scholarship is roughly the same as that of Professor Mitchell, the difficulties Mr. Liu encounters are far greater than those felt by Professor Mitchell. In view of this, Mr. Liu is especially cautious in the use of mathematics, in the hope that what he discusses will be in line with the facts and helpful to practical use. Economics is the study of managing the world and benefiting the people. All suggestions and advocacy are closely related to the national economy. If the cited figures are not in line with the facts, it will not only make people doubt the effectiveness of statistics, but also greatly reduce the applicability of economics. In addition to carefully citing figures, Mr. Liu also reads widely, analyzes foreign regulations, examines domestic facts, weighs the situation and considers the reasons, and studies repeatedly before deciding on countermeasures and writing discussions. Therefore, Mr. Liu's spirit of scholarship can be described as meticulous and pragmatic, which is far from those who engage in the practice with the attitude of "though not exact, it's not far off."</p>
<p>(4) Mr. Liu Dajun's Contribution to Economics in Our Country</p>
<p>If we observe the theoretical aspect of economics in our country at present, the theory of economics in our country is still in the stage of importing and imitating. The date of difficult creation is still quite distant. Therefore, most of the contributions of well-known economists in our country in recent years have been the work of importing foreign goods. Mr. Liu Dajun cannot escape this exception. Although Mr. Liu has not created new theories to benefit the people of the country, he has engaged in economic survey work and compiled economic statistics, as well as encouraged later generations to work hard on in-depth research. His contribution to promoting the progress of economics in recent years in the state of land reclamation cannot be ignored. Now, Mr. Liu's contributions to economics are described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Engaging in survey work to supply "domestic" economic data. Mr. Li Quanshi advocated the compilation of national textbooks to replace imported goods. The intention was good and was admired by the people of the time. However, most of the raw materials used by Mr. Li in compiling domestic textbooks were still imported. Mr. Liu Dajun's job is exactly the opposite of Mr. Li's: advocating the survey of the economic situation in various parts of our country, compiling survey materials for the study of "domestic" economics. Therefore, Mr. Liu's first contribution to economics is to supply "domestic" economic data by starting with survey methods, so that those who aspire to compile "domestic" textbooks in the future can use them.</p>
<p>(2) Compiling "domestic" statistics with "domestic" materials. Mr. Liu's compilation of "domestic" statistics with the figures obtained from the survey, so that the people of the country can understand the economic dynamics of their own country, is one of Mr. Liu's contributions to the society. However, after Mr. Liu published the various "domestic" statistical figures he compiled, they can not only be used by foreign economists as a basis for studying the economic changes in our country, but also enable domestic economists to use their figures to prove whether the economic theories imported from foreign countries are applicable in our country. This is Mr. Liu's second contribution to economics.</p>
<p>(3) Adopting quantitative analysis methods to study economics. Twenty years ago, Mr. Yang Xingfu wrote an article with fragmented figures and published it in the "Eastern Magazine." The elder Wu Zhihui praised it as a rare and hard-to-come-by masterpiece. However, Mr. Liu went a step further than Mr. Yang. In addition to directly investigating the economic situation and compiling economic statistics, he also used the figures obtained from the survey to engage in analysis in order to understand the cause and effect of its changes, and to use it as a compass for future improvement. This is Mr. Liu's third contribution to economics.</p>
<p>(4) Forward-thinking as a guide for young economists. Mr. Liu's method of scholarship is different from those who rely on subjective fantasy. His thinking is also very forward-looking and often serves as a guide for young economists. Mr. Liu has read all the famous economic works in the world. He also diligently reads the newly published magazines at home and abroad. Therefore, Mr. Liu has a clear understanding of the trends in the world's economic thought. As for what Mr. Liu is most interested in in economics, it is currency and finance and industrial construction. Therefore, in the past, when administrative authorities or legislative authorities made decisions on the above two policies, or drafted legislation, they all sought Mr. Liu's opinion. Even the university graduates who went abroad to study in recent years mostly went to Mr. Liu's place for advice before going abroad, asking him to guide them on research methods and research objects. Therefore, although Mr. Liu has been out of school for many years, his educational work in guiding young people has continued as before. From this, it can be seen that in addition to serving as a consultant for the government authorities, Mr. Liu also serves as a guide for cultivating young economists. This is Mr. Liu's fourth contribution to economics in our country.</p>
<p>(5) Hopes for the Chinese people in the future.</p>
<p>Although economics in our country has greatly improved compared to the past in recent years, there is still a vast field for the Chinese people to develop in the future. After describing Mr. Liu's contribution to economics, I can't help but feel a hundred emotions gathering. In the future, in addition to imitating Mr. Liu's spirit of scholarship, we young people hope that the Chinese people will pay attention to the following points and work together:</p>
<p>(1) Recognize reality. In the past, scholars in our country who engaged in the study of economics often lightly believed in theory and ignored facts, and especially did not pay attention to the domestic economic situation. Therefore, they only used their simple logic to speak out recklessly. Suddenly, they suggested trying the Moscow method in Xi'an. Suddenly, they advocated trying the Chicago system in Hankou. Suddenly, they suggested trying the regulations of London in Shanghai. All of this is endless. After examining the reasons for their bold suggestions, it is because they failed to recognize reality. Therefore, in the future, if we study the economy of our country, the first prerequisite must be to first recognize the actual economic situation of our country. Such as holding economic survey work, or going to the mainland for actual investigation. Thus, we can avoid building a cart behind closed doors and not being able to fit the track.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to historical development. The formation of various economic systems must first have a historical background. The change of a system must also have objective conditions. And the composition of future systems must also have indispensable environments. Therefore, its arrival is not accidental, and its departure is not random. Seeking fruit from cause and seeking cause from fruit, they are all closely related to each other. What is this relationship? It is called historical development. In the future, if we study the changes in the economic system, we should pay attention to the process of historical development in order to understand the trend of its changes. Otherwise, what is suggested will not only be cutting the feet to fit the shoes, making it difficult to be practical. It will also be like climbing a tree to catch fish, how can it be of any benefit? The meaning of avoiding fantasy cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>(3) Use numbers and numerical analysis with caution. It is a generally accepted principle that numbers do not lie. However, before applying numbers, you must pay attention to their source. Otherwise, if you misuse them in a roundabout way, the drawbacks will be great. Therefore, if we study economics in the future, we must follow in the footsteps of Mr. Liu and adopt quantitative analysis methods. However, before citing figures, we must first examine their source and the degree of their accuracy. If the accuracy of the figures used is not very high, then the conclusions drawn from the induction will be applicable to an application and it may be reduced to below zero.</p>
<p>(4) The study of economics should start with currency and finance. In the past, economists analyzed the progress of a country's economy, often centering on prices. Therefore, university professors of economics also followed the old method of foreign countries, and taught in the four-part method of consumption, production, transaction, and distribution. However, since our country adopted the legal currency system, the currency and finance of our country are very different from the past. In the future, if we study the changes in the economy of our country, we must first start with currency and finance. The progress of a country's enterprises depends on domestic sales and foreign exports. Domestic sales depend on the level of the domestic value of the currency. At the same time, foreign exports are dominated by the high or low value of the currency to foreign countries. Therefore, Professor Marshall's "Principles of Economics" book excludes currency and finance from the discussion, which seems to only examine the shell of economics, and ignore the arteries and spirit of economics. It is no longer very suitable for the modern environment. Therefore, in the future, if we study economics, we do not have to follow Mr. Marshall's static research, which is reasonable.</p>
<p>(5) Attach importance to planned economy. The various economic control systems implemented during the war can often be regarded as an attempt at economic control. By the time the war ends, a part of the control nature will inevitably be included in the economic system. It is inevitable. Referring to the historical facts after the First World War, it is not difficult to see. Therefore, after the end of the war in our country, because of the devastation everywhere, the economy is in dire need of revival. However, if we rely on the past to let it develop freely, it is not very suitable for post-war China. In order to urge its accelerated revival and modernization, we must adopt a planned economy to make it implement according to the plan and step by step. Therefore, in the future, the Chinese people who study economics should engage in the study of planned economy according to the basic principles of the above (1) (2) (3) and (4). We should also work together to conform to the meaning of Gu Tinglin's saying, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world."</p>
<h3>General Review of Yarn Mill Profits in the Midst of Year End</h3>
<p>— Long Jusheng</p>
<p>The annual general closing of factories, companies, and businesses is approaching again! Although the accounting procedures for the closing of accounts of various industrial and commercial organizations are mostly based on the Gregorian calendar, the collection of accounts and the distribution of official dividends are still in accordance with the old lunar year (the old lunar year is actually abolished but not abolished). Amidst the sound of the general closing of the old year, the operating results of the year are revealed! But in reality, it is still kept secret, so as not to be accused by commentators, and to avoid the feeling of being guilty of possessing valuable things! I am just writing some outlines here. What is really happening? It is still unspoken, right?</p>
<p>Everyone knows the good fortune of the Chinese yarn mills that survived on the isolated island! It is a once-in-a-lifetime golden age amidst the crisis and survival of the motherland! In the past two years, earning millions of yuan has been a common thing! But what about this year's profit performance? Although it is relatively dwarfed, it is still very rich! A small yarn mill with 4,000 spindles can also earn 500,000 or 600,000 yuan. As for large yarn mills with more than 100,000 spindles, they can still purchase about 10 million yuan, which is amazing?</p>
<p>We need to know that the standard cost of a 20-count yarn is that cotton accounts for about 900 yuan (cheaper raw materials only require 700 yuan for cotton), and opening and payment fees account for about 200 yuan (170 or 180 yuan is enough for large production). The total cost is a total of more than 1,100 yuan, and the current market price has risen to 1,400 or 1,500 yuan. Even if the annual market price is usually 1,200 or 1,300 yuan, each 20-count yarn can earn at least a net profit of about 150 yuan. What about 32-count and 12-count yarn, which can earn 200 or 300 yuan each? The average production of each spindle is 1.2 pounds of yarn. So, 4,000 spindles can produce 4,200 pounds, which is 10 pieces of yarn. Each year, the net purchase of yarn is 150 yuan. One day and night's work is a total earning of 1,500 yuan a day, and 45,000 yuan a month. Isn't this like earning 500,000 or 600,000 yuan as described above? Those with more than 100,000 spindles are 25 times the number of 4,000 spindles, earning 25 times 500,000 or 600,000. Isn't that going to earn 12 million or 13 million yuan? However, this year, cotton is strictly controlled, and it is not easy to import foreign cotton. Water fees and insurance fees have increased, and the material item in opening and payment has also doubled compared to previous years. Therefore, the profit estimates of each Chinese yarn mill are about 80% compared to last year. The largest surplus is to promote Shenxin Nine (Shuangma Red Brand factory, I heard that it will be wrapped up and sold by 15 large yarn numbers next year?), Shenxin Two (producing Tiannv brand yarn), Xinyu One and Two factories (producing Earth brand yarn), and Yong'an Three Factory (producing Special Jincheng yarn). To determine it, such as: Anda (producing Flying Horse yarn), Xinsheng (producing Golden Tiger brand yarn), Hefeng, Rongfeng and other factories, the business results are very impressive! Last year, the bonus for yarn mill employees could be divided into 600% or 700% (that is, a monthly salary of 100 yuan can get 600 or 700 yuan at the end of the year, which totals 7,800 yuan in twelve months). And this year? Calling 5 yuan (each yuan of salary, then splitting 4 or 5 yuan) can always be divided, so middle-level employees who earn a monthly salary of 100 yuan have also become petty rich! However, the factory regulations do not allow for borrowing for usual family living expenses. The year-end bonus is the only harvest! The only goal of moving east and repaying west! As for the great wealth of the managers? It can be imagined!</p>

In total, 5 old shares will be given 2 new shares.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Today Water Fee Increases, Dutch Sugar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a continued upward trend due to the increase in the water fee for coarse white sugar by 1 jiao and 6 and a half cents per bag from today onwards. The spot price of 24 coarse white sugar outside the warehouse was 82 yuan, 82 yuan and 5 jiao to 7 jiao, and the price for February 10 was 82 yuan and 7 jiao, 83 yuan to 83 yuan and 2 jiao, up 1 yuan and 3 jiao. New Dutch red sugar was 67 yuan, old sugar was 66 yuan and 2 jiao, up 1 yuan. Taikoo car white sugar was relatively cheap, B mark 82 yuan and 4 jiao, February 10 order 83 yuan, DY mark and HX mark were all 80 yuan, a small decrease of 5 jiao, HM mark 73 yuan and 7 jiao to 74 yuan and a half, dozens of bags of Hong Kong's extra high ice flower Qing were opened, 73 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: A Batch of Government Red Dates Opened</h3>
<p>Recently, more miscellaneous red dates have arrived, and the market trend has been very mediocre and has not improved at all. Yesterday, 250 bags of Jinan Government red dates were opened, and the price was 31 yuan. The market price was 32 or 33 yuan. The goods from Du County were difficult to sell well due to the low quality, and were sold for 34 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Factory's Woolen Cloth Trade is Booming</h3>
<p>The trade of woolen cloth from this factory has been quite prosperous recently. Because the imported goods are expensive and scarce, and also meet the tastes of retail customers, the sales of goods from this factory are more smooth than imported goods. Now people in the industry all believe that the market will rise and not fall, and the goods are all held back for higher prices, and the market is strong. Its Yinfeng Caishenhu, and Yihua Wufutu, and Meilun Santa Claus and other temperaments, because Dabojinhua and other inland areas can be sold, the price of the goods is harder than those produced by other factories, and the trade is even more prosperous. Yesterday, the wholesale price of Caishenhu Yuanzhigong woolen cloth was 26 yuan per yard, Wufutu Tuosijin riding breeches woolen cloth was 25 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and Santa Claus plate four woolen cloth Hailvsi was 10 yuan net price.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Expectation of a Bull Market Through Stockpiling</h3>
<p>Recently, in the hardware market, due to the approaching end of the year and various industries preparing for closure, transactions have become abnormal. Prices of all goods have been rising without falling. The reason is the scarcity of incoming goods, while the stock in this port is ultimately limited. Therefore, the idea of stockpiling is strong, with the expectation of a thriving bull market in the new year. Yesterday, products like Huisi iron were at 180 yuan, single-ply tinplate at 145 yuan, double-ply sheets at 278 yuan, local factory nails at 75 yuan, new pan yuan at 80 yuan, and black iron billets at 1,300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Processed Coal Increases by 10 Yuan, Large Chunks at 12 Yuan Per Load</h3>
<p>Processed coal has been in short supply lately because the production of Zilai Fire Company has decreased, while the sales market in this port has become more active. This has caused a significant shortage, with dealers adding 10 yuan. Colleagues are sending it off at 210 yuan per ton, and bulk coal at 200 yuan. Retail in this street is 12 yuan per load (100 market catties) for large chunks, and 11.5 yuan for screened coal, also slightly increasing in price.</p>
<h3>Observations on the Import of Foreign Rice Due to Food Shortages</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhonglian</p>
<p>Rice is the staple food of our country, and the people of the South rely on it as an indispensable commodity that cannot be lacking for even a day. The rice-producing areas of our country, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces, occupy a vast area, and the production volume is also considerable. However, in recent years, there has been a constant concern about the supply not meeting the demand. Upon examining the crux of the problem, it is nothing more than the following reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Our country's agriculture is underdeveloped;</p>
<p>(2) Our country's population is gradually increasing, with fewer producers and more consumers;</p>
<p>(3) In recent years, there have been constant wars and bandits everywhere, with farmers fleeing and fields becoming ruins, resulting in years without good harvests;</p>
<p>(4) Unscrupulous merchants, driven by greed, hoard and speculate;</p>
<p>(5) In recent years, rice-producing areas have mostly stopped growing rice and instead switched to growing cotton, soybeans, wheat, or vegetables and fruits, according to the suitability of their soil;</p>
<p>(6) After the Japanese government strictly controlled food supplies, the number of farmers switching to other industries has gradually increased, leading to a sense of insufficient food supplies domestically, and a decrease in food production. The amount of food shipped to the occupied areas of our country must be considerable; in addition, the sustenance of the troops in China is entirely dependent on Chinese rice. The lack of rice in our country in recent years is also a major reason.</p>
<p>The above points all have a direct impact on the shortage of food for the people. Since we are aware of the inadequacy of food for the people, we have no choice but to rely on the supply of foreign rice to make up for this deficiency.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, when foreign rice was first imported into our country, the amount was negligible, so tariffs were waived to feed the people. In the early years of the Guangxu era, imports were still small, but they gradually increased. In the first year of the Republic of China, it increased to over 2.7 million loads, in the fourth year to over 8.4 million loads, and in the fifth year to over 11.2 million loads. It then decreased slightly, with only over 1.15 million loads in the ninth year. After the tenth year, the trend increased again, reaching over 22.4 million loads in the twelfth year. It decreased again after the thirteenth year, and then increased again to over 21 million loads in the sixteenth year. In recent years, the import volume has mostly been between 3 and 4 million loads. It is estimated that the import volume in the 26th year reached over 3.4 million loads, over 4 million loads in the 27th year, and over 3.2 million loads in the 28th year. Here is a table showing the import volume of foreign rice since the first year of the Republic of China (unit: loads):</p>

<h3>Coal Briquettes Fall in Price, Hongji Coal Increases Abnormally</h3>
<p>Due to speculators taking advantage of the exchange rate changes in the Shanghai coal market and arbitrarily raising prices again, the price of Hongji lump coal has risen to 250 yuan per ton. However, it has been found that due to the mild weather this winter, the quantity required is only over 4,000 tons per day, which is also less than in previous years. Moreover, due to smooth shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam, the source of Hongji coal is not lacking, and the production of domestic coal is also gradually recovering, so the quantity shipped to Shanghai in recent days is also large. In addition, Japanese Korean coal dust is being dumped in Shanghai in large quantities. Under the above circumstances, the price should fall back.</p>
<p>Coal Briquettes Fall in Price</p>
<p>The market price of coal briquettes was previously secretly raised to 9 yuan per load by several large mechanized coal briquette factories, which caused dissatisfaction. However, because the weather is mild, citizens are saving more, resulting in a large decrease in the actual sales of coal briquettes. In previous winters, the daily sales volume was over 1,000 tons, but now it has decreased by 10% or 20%. Coal briquette factories are competing more fiercely due to sluggish sales, and are selling at reduced prices, causing the price to fall from 9 yuan per load to 8.5 yuan and 8 yuan. As for the inferior coal briquettes circulating in the market, which are made with sawdust and mud, no one is asking about them anymore.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Jinghu Station Annihilated at Tianfu Temple</h3>
<p>According to someone from Kunshan, at about 8 a.m. on the morning of the 13th, more than ten Japanese soldiers stationed at Tianfu Temple took guns to nearby villages to loot chickens and ducks. They were discovered by a Chinese mobile unit passing by the area. When they approached, they surrounded and attacked, annihilating all the Japanese soldiers. However, during the bombardment, the gunfire was heard by the Japanese troops stationed nearby, who immediately mobilized a large number of Japanese troops to arrive at the scene and requested reinforcements from Jiading, Taicang, and Kunshan. After completing their mission, the Chinese mobile unit retreated westward. Unexpectedly, when they arrived near Xinfeng Town, they encountered more than 200 Japanese reinforcements from Taicang. At the same time, Japanese troops from Jiading also arrived. The mobile unit fought bravely under the combined attack, and finally broke through the encirclement and retreated towards Qu Sa, acting very quickly. In this battle, eight or nine Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Chinese army also suffered casualties. It is reported that after the Chinese army retreated, the Japanese army burned down twenty or thirty houses in the countryside of Tianfu Temple and the Xuangiaqiao area near Gelong Town to vent their hatred.</p>
<h3>Labor Disputes Resolved Continuously, Labor and Management Harmonious as Usual, There is Room for Improvement in the Commercial Press Dispute</h3>
<p>After the Commercial Press Union issued a final appeal the day before yesterday, requesting the General Manager to answer the five proposals put forward by the Union one by one, they received a telegram from the General Manager from Hong Kong, analyzing each item and providing a responsible and sincere response from the Shanghai authorities. The Union immediately convened an emergency executive and supervisory meeting and a general meeting of all group leaders, and unanimously decided to pass it. In order to take the overall situation into account and seek to simplify the situation, they will no longer insist on the other four items, such as the transfer of colleagues and the current rice subsidy method, as long as the company has goodwill. As for the dismissal item, they will still adhere to the previous proposal, but without creating a hostile situation to avoid escalating the situation.</p>
<p>Commercial Dispute Temporarily Comes to an End</p>
<p>A declaration was issued solemnly stating the firm position of the Union as a temporary end. The company, in view of the Union's determination, and for the sake of taking the overall situation into account, may not implement the dismissal item, even though it has been announced. In this way, the company's prestige can be maintained, and the colleagues will not suffer the hardship of unemployment, which is a win-win situation.</p>

<h3>A Review of Important Administrative Matters of the Public Works Department Over the Past Year (3)</h3>
<p>Economic Committee</p>
<p>In accordance with Amendment No. 7 to the resolutions passed by the ratepayers' meeting, the Bureau expanded the Economic Committee, increasing the number of members by eight.

<p>Road Flooding</p>
<p>In October of last year, the city was attacked by a storm, resulting in widespread flooding throughout the Settlement. According to the Director of Public Works, the city has experienced waterlogging in recent years due to the excessive number of unauthorized constructions in the extra-Settlement road areas of western Shanghai. This has resulted in the destruction of a large portion of the drainage equipment in that area, with ditch water overflowing onto the road surface, reaching the western end of the Settlement's drainage system. Since the beginning of the year before last, the Public Works Department has begun to set up special ditch-cleaning equipment. By the end of that year, the main hub of the drainage system had been completely cleared and remained in a clean state. The major flood that occurred in October of last year was a special circumstance. At that time, a hurricane struck Shanghai, coinciding with a high tidal period, which激起了the river tide, coupled with heavy rainfall that lasted for 24 hours, resulting in the worst flood since 1865. The only solution was to block the outlets of the drains on one hand and use pumps to remove the accumulated water on the other. This plan was designed by the chief engineer of the French Municipal Council years ago, and it is only applicable to the area of the two Settlements south of the Suzhou River. It would cost about 20 million yuan and take ten years to complete.</p>
<p>Election Committee</p>
<p>In August of last year, a committee was set up to study whether the procedures for electing directors in the future could be changed. The committee members were Arlooman, Grace, Mitchell, Suweier, Femaeriga, and Yasui Gengo, totaling six people. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Heavy Ball and Slippery Ground, Evenly Matched</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the audience in Yiyuan reached more than 5,000 people, but the overnight rain in the stadium had accumulated water that had not dried, the ball was heavy, and the ground was slippery, which affected the battle between the two sides. Donghua Han Longhai was injured before the battle, Cai Shengsen also played, and after Li Yichen left Shanghai, the left forward was filled by Huang Kehou, and Fei Chunhua was transferred to the right forward. The Western Police had veteran Victoria guarding the rear, and the battle was evenly matched. In the first half, the Western Police had a twelve-yard kick opportunity, and Quesen Zufu scored a goal and opened the record. Donghua counterattacked, and at 32 minutes, Jia Youliang took a free kick, Huang Kehou headed it obliquely, and the Western Police Crook scored an own goal and went into the net, becoming a 1-1 tie. The second half was scoreless for both sides. When the whistle sounded for a long time, it was a 1-1 draw, and the extra time. The Western Police Barda advanced rapidly along the side, and Huang Kehou followed ineffectively. Barda swept a foot across, Qin Bigao caught it and lost it again, Willie Watt arrived in time and sent it into the net. Donghua was unfortunately eliminated with a score of 1-2.</p>
<p>Each Scores a Goal, Evenly Divided</p>
<p>Donghua kicked off, and the five forwards advanced together. The Western Police's rear defense was tight and was blocked into a corner kick. Wan Jin came from the left, and Youliang failed to catch it. The ball entered Donghua's front. Qin Bigao slipped, but fortunately the ball stopped and did not move. Quesen kicked it too hard and went off-road. At 20 minutes, the front of Donghua's door was tight. The entire Western Police team was dispatched. Willie took the lead in attacking, and Qin shot it out not far. Barda raised his right foot and shot fiercely. Qin hugged it with both hands. Five minutes later, the Western Police carried out an encirclement again. Fei Chunhua rushed back to save and brought down Barda, who was sentenced to a twelve-yard kick. Quesen Zufu kicked it in one stroke. After Donghua lost this ball, he was unwilling and forced the entire line. Jia Youliang had the opportunity to take a free kick and sent it forward remotely. Huang Kehou's header missed the target and flew outward. Crook did not succeed in saving the ball, but instead knocked the ball into the net. Donghua gained without effort and became a 1-1 tie. The first half ended in a draw.</p>
<p>Extra Time, Miserably Defeated</p>
<p>After the break, Donghua Huang Kehou changed to center-back, Liang Shutang moved to the forward, and the Western Police Barda and Willie Watt exchanged positions. Kick off again. Donghua's offensive was not weak, and they attacked the goal several times in a row, but they were all blocked. Qin Bigao became the target of public criticism. Donghua's defense was tight and there were no mistakes. Grenberg secretly fired a cold arrow in the crowd, and Bigao shot it out. Fonseca added a foot, and Bigao forced a corner kick. The Western Police opened it too lightly. Donghua had the opportunity to take a free kick. Han Longhai passed it to Liang Shutang. Outside 30 yards, he raised his foot and knocked on the door, but went over the wood. The statutory time limit was reached, and neither side had been able to achieve anything. According to the usual practice, the time was extended by fifteen minutes. The score in the first half of the field was still 1-1. After the change of sides, both sides showed fatigue. Five minutes later, the Western Police suddenly became active, advancing rapidly along the side, dribbling past Huang and Li, and picking it up in front of the goal. Qin Bigao caught it and lost it again. Willie Watt rushed to the bottom of the net and sent it in. 2-1 Donghua was unfortunately eliminated.</p>

<h3>Family New Year Scenery</h3>
<p>—Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>——Fruit Platter and Qing Offering on the Desk——</p>
<p>Another year has passed easily, and the Lunar New Year is about to arrive. Thus, thousands of households are busy preparing for the New Year, all looking forward to the new atmosphere of "firecrackers (banned on the isolated island, only money cannons are used as substitutes) sound to remove the old, and peach charms update thousands of households." Nowadays, many families have added eye-catching seasonal products, one is the "fruit platter" and the other is the "Qing offering on the desk"—winter plum, nandina, and narcissus. Even in a small room that can only accommodate the knees, they must try their best to arrange it, in order to create a scene for welcoming the New Year and receiving guests, and also to see the atmosphere and change the new environment after a year of hard work.</p>
<p>The fruit platter is also called the New Year's Eve platter. According to Menglianglu, "On New Year's Eve, the Inner Division Yisiju presented exquisite New Year's Eve fruit boxes, which contained all kinds of fine fruits and market food." According to the old custom, on New Year's Eve, elders gave children fruit platters, which were called New Year's Eve platters. According to Menglianglu, this custom has a long history. Nowadays, the fruit platters sold on the market are even more bizarre and colorful. There are chocolates, peanut brittle, cream candy, almond candy, preserved plums, oranges, banana candy, etc. They are also packed in silk-ribboned glass-faced brocade boxes, dazzling the eyes and fascinating the mind. However, the cost of a box starts from tens of gold, and then hundreds of gold, which is definitely not something that poor scholars dare to ask about or can afford. Even if you give up the whole plate and buy bulk, each pound also requires two or three yuan to six, seven, or nine yuan. The price is several times higher than in previous years. In the psychology of the poor, they can only "plan" how to "fill" their stomachs and how to get through the year. How can they talk about setting up a "fruit platter"?</p>
<p>The winter plum, nandina, and narcissus on the desk, on the other hand, symbolize the unyielding doctrine of patriots, loyal ministers, and righteous men, that is, not being tempted by profit, not being threatened by coercion, and not being humiliated. You see the high integrity of the winter plum, the red heart of the nandina, and the purity of the narcissus, not competing for beauty with ordinary flowers, not fearing the destruction of wind and snow, and not being afraid of the cold weather. The ice and snow spirit of the three is admirable. They are offered on desks to be used as a morning and evening reference for self-alertness. Speaking of plum blossom bonsai, the works of Mr. Kong Zhiqing of Bailuo Shopping Center are the most flavorful, with each pot arranged like a painting. No matter how shabby you are, you have to buy a pot back to celebrate the occasion. Writing to this point, I feel heartbroken that a beautiful fruit plate in my old home in Yangshupu was destroyed! Several goldfish swimming in the glass tank and the plum blossom bonsai sacrificed for the country! I think their spirits are immortal and will surely leave righteousness between heaven and earth.</p>
<h3>Western Suits, Long Robes, and Zhongshan Suits</h3>
<p>—Bao Fuxing</p>
<p>In the era we live in, in this Shanghai city we live in, the clothes of the general public are nothing more than three types: Western suits, long robes, and Zhongshan suits. Most of the more progressive elements in society wear Western suits, especially young people such as students. Another more conservative group mostly wears long robes. As for Zhongshan suits, they were once used as uniforms by students and civil servants, but they seem to be rarely seen at present.</p>
<p>Some people have a wrong understanding of Chinese and Western clothing. They think that wearing a Western suit is Westernization and wearing a long robe is following the old ways, and they focus their eyes on the boundary between "Western" and "ancient". In fact, any clothing only seeks to be economical and convenient, so why ask about "Chinese", "Western", "Western", or "ancient"?</p>
<p>Usually, whenever I put on a long robe, I always feel very comfortable, but once I start doing things, it becomes very inconvenient. The sleeves are too wide, and it is not as convenient to walk as in a Western suit. The long robe also has a major shortcoming: the spirit of the person wearing a long robe is often easy to become "gentle" and unable to be invigorated.</p>
<p>I remember someone saying that the Western suit has now become a world garment. Indeed, in our country, including Shanghai, the Western suit has been widely adopted. This is not a false admiration for "Westernization", but because the Western suit has its own advantages. May I ask, among the many people who wear Western suits, how many can be found who are hunchbacked? Strangely enough, the Western suit seems to have a power that can naturally straighten our waists. In addition to this, the Western suit also has a very important advantage, which is also the shortcoming of the long robe, that is, it can make us more energetic when walking and doing things.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, it is certainly not impossible to wear a long robe, but Western suits are ultimately better. However, in recent years, some people have thought that Western suits are also imperfect. For example, ties and other things are both cumbersome and superfluous. What is the use of them? Fastening them on the neck, wouldn't it hinder hygiene? (This seems to be Lin Yutang's humorous view.) I agree with this view very much. Not only do I agree, but I also think that the style of Western suits is untidy and ugly. Why should there be a blank space in front of the neck for a tie? Why not have a pocket in the upper right corner? Therefore, I think Western suits are also not desirable.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to contribute a kind of clothing to you, that is, the Zhongshan suit first created by our National Father. The Zhongshan suit can be said to be almost like a Western suit, but it is more beautiful and tidy than a Western suit, and it can also remove the complicated and unnecessary cliches such as wearing a tie. In addition, I would like to ask you to think about it: after wearing a Zhongshan suit, is it convenient and energetic to walk and do things in all aspects?</p>

<h3>Weekly Home Cooking Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>It's Lunar New Year time again. As in previous years, approaching the end of the year, all meat and vegetable prices rise, but this year the increase is particularly frightening. These past few days, encountering several familiar housewives in the market, they all shook their heads and sighed, repeatedly exclaiming, "Expensive! Expensive! Expensive!" Carrying thirty or forty dollars, hoping to buy some chicken, fish, fresh meat, or cured meat, one finds it difficult to know where to start and can only return home with an empty basket. Such a situation is unprecedented. It truly makes one feel like one is eating banknotes rather than vegetables. I advise housewives, if your financial resources are abundant, then go to the market and splurge. But if your resources are limited, everyone should save a little, regardless of whether it's the New Year or not!</p>

<h3>Comprehensive Housing Considerations</h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>The latest knowledge and experience in civil engineering, very useful for the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Contemporary builders, to prevent problems before they arise, have recently learned from the reconstruction in Europe after the war, and offer the following latest insights on "air raid" prevention:</p>
<p>(1) A square-shaped residence surrounded on all four sides, leaving a gap in the middle as a backyard, separated from the neighbors on the left, right, and rear only by a wall or fence, with no accessible door and no way to quickly escape outwards. In the event of aerial bombing, the "air pressure" is trapped inside and cannot easily expand outwards, greatly increasing the destructive force and potentially doubling the danger. The new method avoids the encirclement of dead-end streets and high firewalls, instead creating front and rear rows of buildings that are not connected at both ends, with the gap between the rows serving as the backyard. Moreover, these two rows of buildings facing each other across the alley should be at least 24 meters apart.</p>
<p>(2) In large buildings shared by several families, in addition to ascending and descending via the stairwell and the main entrance at the front, an additional staircase must be built, with another door opening to the backyard. The space under the stairs is best used as a storage room, serving as an air raid shelter.</p>
<p>(3) For houses with thick and expensive materials, the new method allows one to pass through a tunnel after exiting the door at the bottom of the stairs, leading to the street.</p>
<p>(4) Every home must have three doors: a front door, a back door, and a door that allows interconnection with neighbors.</p>
<p>(5) The main structural materials of the house should be changed to steel-reinforced concrete, which not only prevents the ravages of fire but also blocks the outward transmission of sound waves.</p>
<p>(6) Inside the house, the windows and the floor should not be connected or touching any wood. The floor laid flat in the room should not be connected or touching the floor of the adjacent room. These methods are all for preventing fire.</p>
<p>(7) Interior corridors or air raid shelters should have a brick-and-stone arch (similar to Chinese city gate tunnels) on top, which has the greatest resistance to collapse and is very useful for air defense. Wooden staircases are best avoided altogether.</p>
<p>(8) Small window panes that are struck by the "air pressure" of a bombing will suffer less damage. For large panes of glass, do not forget to install "louvered wooden shutters Jaloladen" on the outside to strictly block light leakage, or cover them with iron "roller shutters Roladen" that are easy to raise and lower for protection, thus avoiding the problem of faint light leaking from the gaps in the curtains under special fire control regulations.</p>
<p>(9) Essential home defense tools: one is a shovel for digging soil, two is an axe for clearing obstructions, three is a bell for calling for help in distress, and four is a climbing rope six meters long and 3/8 mm in diameter with a "Carbine Hook" for easily climbing and securing heavy loads.</p>
<p>Casual Talk</p>
<p>— Nian Yun</p>
<p>"Eat more, talk less" seems a bit unfashionable to say nowadays.</p>
<p>Rice prices are high, and everyone feels the threat, but the mice in the rice stores are unaffected, with an inexhaustible supply of food, which is enviable.</p>
<p>In the past, when writing letters to elders, one would end with the phrase "Please eat well and add to your meals," but nowadays it's a bit difficult to write that.</p>
<p>Although many people are starving to death on the "isolated island," quite a few are also dying from overeating.</p>
<h3>Recent Trends in Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation at the Year-End Market (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Tian Shi</p>
<p>Those used as substitutes for wood, such as making into a xiao flute, produce a clear and ethereal sound. When made into a violin Violine (four-stringed instrument), the sound is clear and penetrating. Those used as substitutes for iron, such as making into springs, are supple and unbreakable. When made into wall clocks (as shown in Figure 2), from the large clock face to the small gears or hands, or elastic springs, everything is transparent inside and out. When made into camera lenses or women's clothing ornaments, they are as crystal clear as glass, and it is difficult to distinguish whether they are crafted by ghosts or refined jade.</p>
<p>4. Transportation.  The materials used to replace hard rubber but with slight elasticity seem to be newer with Trolit. Trolit is like stalactites formed over time by carbonic acid lime accumulating and hanging down from crevices in rocks where spring water drips. Using limestone and charcoal as raw materials, it softens like clay when exposed to high heat of 125 to 195 degrees Celsius. After being ejected into a cooler under high pressure, it can be easily shaped, and can be made into compass dials, eyeglass cases, typewriter boxes, fountain pen barrels, or pencil tubes. Another type uses limestone and charcoal as raw materials and undergoes complex processes in chemistry to form "Mipolam. " This material resembles leather and rubber and is an improved artificial rubber that does not show cracks after being used for a long time. It is used to replace leather in the manufacture of travel bags or handbags for women's use. When used to replace metal objects, it is mostly made into pipes, which weigh only one-eighth as much as red copper and lead. It can be bent, sawn, cut, ground, and pierced with a cone. It does not ignite, is not corroded by oil, water, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, etc., and is not damaged by chemical reactions in water, and does not cause liquids entering and exiting the pipe to be tainted with a slight odor or strange taste. Mineral springs in sanatoriums use this Mipolam piping, which is very convenient for distributing drinks to various faucets, and tea restaurants can use this material for water pipes, which can also save labor of transportation and extraction of wine cellars.</p>

<h3>Lunar New Year's Eve Dinner Before Qin</h3>
<p>— Hammer Mang</p>
<p>Holidays belong to the wealthy, like Manager Huang, Comprador Pan, who celebrate Christmas, the Winter Solstice, and the Western New Year. After enjoying the three days of the Western New Year, Mrs. Huang and Mrs. Pan go shopping for New Year's goods, preparing to eat Lunar New Year's Eve dinner...</p>
<p>The Southern Goods store is packed with two or three layers of people, but the ladies have a chair to sit on, leisurely selecting top-quality black fungus, sea cucumber, shiitake mushrooms, silver fish, chatting and laughing with the young clerk. The clerk ties up the packages one by one, and the maids pile them into the car, which looks like a warehouse. This mobile warehouse makes the poor gawk!</p>
<p>New invention: Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, 40 yuan, 50 yuan...120 yuan per table: "Welcome to book your Lunar New Year's Eve dinner," "Top Scholar Lunar New Year's Eve Dinner," "God of Wealth Lunar New Year's Eve Dinner," "Get Rich Lunar New Year's Eve Dinner" — Get rich, get rich, the rich become even richer. After eating the Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, they calculate their hoarding plans, aiming for a windfall next year, aiming for a big score, making a fortune...</p>
<p>On the wall with "No Urinating" there is a gray piece of paper, a bitter complaint from an apprentice, scrawled in uneven pencil, an exchange of blood and tears: "Sirs, we are not as good as those who farm the land. The boss only gives us four yuan for the New Year. How is that enough for us!" Following is a list of daily necessities: "Haircut 30 cents, cloth shoes 2 yuan a pair, toothbrush 30 cents each, towel, soap, fried meat balls..." This is the minimum expense for a poor apprentice, but how can everyone have enough with four yuan. At that "silver-tabled" Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, there are fresh dishes, fresh verdant daffodil branches—just a waste of one night, the apprentice's roughest necessities for a year! A year! A new need for a year, a material desire below the poverty line, but still a zero...</p>
<p>Sirs, I must have seen a piece of news, when a young woman was getting on the tram, because she had eaten too much, she vomited the fish and meat and rice she had eaten. Immediately, before the street cleaner could bother, a poor person ate the vomit again... This story, no, this living picture, even the most avant-garde painter would not have thought of this subject. Yes, in a night when many people are eating Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, in the alley, there is an animal rummaging in the trash can, rummaging for the scraps of Lunar New Year's Eve dinner that others have left over, oh, even the very clean meat bones. Is it a dog? No, it is a person...</p>
<p>The poor live day to day, those who swell their faces to survive can only swallow their tears into their stomachs. — Year-end, year-end — expenses, expenses — dodge debts, dodge debts: three strict and unrelaxed melodies disturb these people's eardrums. Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, drag it on, drag it on, but in the end it has to be eaten on the last day, but it cannot be like the managers and compradors who wipe their mouths and that is it — there is a dark heavy gate behind...</p>
<p>Some people eat two Lunar New Year's Eve dinners — Small Lunar New Year's Eve dinner, Big Lunar New Year's Eve dinner; some eat it with worry, some eat it happily, and even more have nothing to eat...</p>
<h3>Share a Slice of the Pie</h3>
<p>— KK</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou Ou</p>
<p>He casually tossed away the cigarette butt, lowered his head, and brushed off the ash from his body, completely without needing Shao Wen to further confirm the meaning of what he said, seemingly very understanding.</p>
<p>"Am I not aware of that?" The Western-dressed gentleman said, not wanting to be outdone.</p>
<p>Yuan Shaowen smiled at both of them, then shook his head and said:</p>
<p>"This name was thought up by him and me together, and the reason for it is probably not easy to guess!" He looked back at the skinny man. "Mr. Zhongqian is indeed a Ping opera performer, but he was wrong just now..."</p>
<p>The skinny man awkwardly twirled his Fu Manchu mustache with his left hand, because Shao Wen's criticism of what he said made him somewhat unhappy; but Shao Wen calling him a Ping opera performer was very much to his liking.</p>
<p>"This name isn't like Red Peony, Hibiscus, or Little Lingzhi, just meant to make people feel beautiful and enchanting immediately upon seeing it." Yuan Shaowen leaned to the side, rested his chin on one hand, and said in a very excited tone, "It happened last summer. Little Wu's mother had only passed away for a week or two. Because he was very sad, he stayed at home and didn't perform, so he asked me to accompany him and chat every day, and by the way, review the books I taught him last year. Don't think he's just an opera performer; he actually knows he has a country in his heart! He often asked me about the news of the times and how badly China was being bullied. Of course, I told him as much as I knew, and I even gave him an example, saying that China's terrain, when connected as a whole, looks just like a begonia leaf, and those ambitious countries are like caterpillars that specialize in eating begonia leaves. Some have already bitten off a piece on the edge of the leaf, and some are still gnawing in the center of the leaf. If we can't drive these caterpillars away, this begonia leaf will be eaten up..."</p>
<p>"That's right, a very good analogy!" The young man in the Western suit tapped the table with his fingers, expressing his agreement very innocently; the skinny man lit another Fortress brand cigarette, appearing not very interested in listening. (13)</p>
<h3>Golden Pearl of Tiger's Courage</h3>
<p>— Xiu Bi</p>
<p>——Street Sketches, Part 1</p>
<p>A middle-aged man with a face covered in stove ash was silently drawing on the sidewalk with chalk, drawing.</p>
<p>Many curious children gathered from all directions, forming a circle.</p>
<p>What is that guy doing? Some children thought.</p>
<p>"A snake! A snake!" Before long, many children shouted.</p>
<p>"A snake! That's right! Snake," the man heard the children's voices, stood up, and forced his hoarse throat to shout, "Friends, there are various kinds of snakes, some..."</p>
<p>After he shouted so loudly, the people loitering around also gathered around him. There were black-clad "knights," "sisters-in-law" who hang around, "friends" from factories, and... in short, the audience was also diverse.</p>
<p>"Listen to me, there is a kind of snake called the Little Green Snake, also known as the Bamboo-encased Green... there is one called the Red-banded Racer... there is one called the Seven-foot Snake. If it bites someone, the person will 'die' after walking seven feet. This kind of snake is the most vicious. There is also the Cobra, also known as the Rattlesnake, that is terrible, not a 'game', blood is seen on the spot, and death follows immediately... The terror of poisonous snakes is truly 'irreversible'."</p>
<p>The speaker spoke while gesticulating, saliva flying everywhere, fully showing his "vigor." "But, why? Why is he so excited?" Many listeners could not help but guess.</p>
<p>Don't worry, the explanation is coming. As soon as the man saw that the crowd was listening with great interest, he pulled out a cloth bag—a small, rectangular cloth bag—from his pocket and held it in his hand.</p>
<p>"But, what should you do if you are really bitten by a poisonous snake? Wait to die? Hmph, if you don't encounter a brother, of course, you can only wait to die..."</p>
<p>So, he is actually a man with great magical powers!</p>
<p>"But, if you are lucky enough to encounter a brother, like today, then there is nothing to fear. Speaking of this, some friends may want to ask, what abilities does this brother have? Nothing else, but this bag in my hand is a treasure for saving the world and helping people." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Striving Philosophy of Life (20)</h3>
<p>Failing to recognize the object of fear clearly leads to fearing the enemy's illness. Feeling too small leads to fearing one's own illness. Because of fearing the enemy, one fears oneself. Because of fearing oneself, one fears the enemy. These two psychological illnesses are always related and extend to each other. What striving, how can one even be worthy of discussing it!</p>
