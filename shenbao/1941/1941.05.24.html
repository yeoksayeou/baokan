<p>倫敦　據最近消息、克里特島仍在激戰中、該島居民自動齊起助戰、頗爲得力、德軍縱在僻遠無軍隊處由空降落、然每一農民或男或女皆予抵禦、德軍天空攻擊現對三要點而發、一爲北海濱中部之希拉克里安、已在該處鎭中佔據房屋若干所、但未能佔據飛機塲、一爲勒提摩、該處德軍進攻者已被擊退、一爲瑪勒米、德軍似已在該處佔有立足地、據開羅公報宣稱、應付局勢之行動現正在進行中、希臘與克里特間之德軍天空交通、現正由英空軍之轟炸機加以阻撓、諸機現仍在攻擊德軍出發地點之希臘飛機塲、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>倫敦　昨日午後下院行將休會時、首相邱吉爾陳述克里特島戰事現况、據稱、戰事繼續激烈進行、英軍仍控制局勢、惟德軍已耗重大代價、獲得若干局部勝利、德方動用大批空中運輸之軍隊與傘兵作戰、其數日增、現傳德軍已佔希拉克里安城、（按該城爲克里特島之最大城市、人口約三三、〇〇〇人）、諒僅若干屋宇有德兵竄入藏身而已、且該城飛機塲仍在英軍扼守中、拉狄莫區無特殊戰况可報、僅昨日（星期二日）淸晨敵軍會圖攻該處飛機塲、但已遭阻遏、加尼亞至蘇達灣區昨日淸晨敵軍猛施攻擊、白畫又有傘兵在加尼西南降落、遭英砲隊與機關槍猛擊、瑪勒米加尼西南十哩飛機塲及柯萊斯迤西之區、現似巳被敵軍所佔、但該機塲仍在砲火下、而該區海岸綫尚在英軍之手、現戰事續趨激烈、必將賡續多時、昨夜敵軍開始作海上運兵登陸之圖、惟駛往克里特島之敵方護航隊、遭英海軍截斷、當有敵船四艘或係載軍隊擬從事登陸活動者及護航之敵驅逐艦一艘均遭擊沉、今日（星期三）敵方大舉圖還軍隊入克里特島逸去、即加攻擊、關於其後戰况尚米接續報、僅知畫間戰事激烈、及敵機襲擊英船與英艦攻擊敵護航隊耳、其結果皆未息、但觀於地中海英海軍實力之勁强、渠感覺攻擊之結果、定可滿意云、</p>
<p>至此某議員建議首相電致克里特島軍隊、表示感佩與信任、首相答曰、渠必將爲此、克里特島之戰役、奇特而激烈、英軍方面無空中協助、此因無良好飛機塲、並非無飛機所致、敵方則無砲隊與坦克車、縱有亦極少、雙方均無退却之法、此乃拚死之惡戰、渠必致電勉勵該島軍隊、無疑的彼等刻正從事極重要之戰役、將影響地中海戰事之整個前途云、某議員向首相謂、敵軍無坦克車是否含英軍則有坦克車之意、邱氏答稱、渠未會想到有此詢問云、（廿三日路透社電）</p>

<p>斯丹埠　德國對於克利特島所採取之攻勢、此間各界均密切予以注視、例如衆議員薩達克在「亞克亞姆報」發表一文、內稱、「德國此决進攻克利特島殆爲一種新戰術之嘗試、倘獲成功、則克利特島乃至地中海東部與北非洲均將成爲德國根據地、並將鼓勵德國採用同樣戰術、以進攻英倫三島、職是之故、此事匪特爲軍事的勝利、且爲新戰術之成功、是以减削海上覇權之重要性」云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3 id="c5">祝不列顚帝國日 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>今天是不列顚帝國的紀念日，英人稱之爲EmpireDay帝國日。不列顚帝國之下，包含若干王國，自治邦，屬國，屬地，蔚爲世界最大的複式組織國家，而以英吉利王國爲中心。不列顚帝國各部分的政制政情，可加指摘者當然甚多，然每一部分的趨向民治，以及民治的部分之逐漸增加，確是不容抹煞的事實。不列顚帝國當然不是世界的創造者，主宰者，或領導者，然擁有世界的廣泛發言權，世界有甚多的問題以不列顚的主張與行動爲重要的決定因素，這亦是不容吾認的現象。尤如十八九世紀以後的世界歷史，殆是不列顚直接間接所構成。</p>
<p>今天的不列顚帝國方逢嚴重的患難。他的敵人明白標榜着，以粉碎不列顚爲目的；而其多方的軍事行動亦即認定了這一目的，竭全力，拚性命，以孤注爲賭博。若說當前局勢，正是不列顚的存亡生死關頭，豈是過甚之辭。最近戰事，在近東的伊拉克，在地中海的克里特島，戰况慘烈，幾乎將以肉搏來分勝負；這一勝負雖無關全局，無關終局，亦即無關不列顚的生死存亡，然影響所及，可使不列顚在戰爭機構的運用上分爲兩橛。於此便得想像他最近所遭遇者，乃是如何程度的嚴重，而今天的帝國日，却須渡過於若此嚴重的氛圍之中。凡是他的友國，安得不寄以莫大同情。</p>
<p>中美與英國分處三洲，英國與屬領所構成的不列顚帝國，則與中美相密接：中國與不列顚在軍事上雖各有所對抗的敵人；然在反侵略與擁護民治的意義上，則三國實站立於同一方面的戰綫。這在戰爭中，英國不能獨勝，必是整個不列顚帝國的協力制勝；不列顚帝國不能獨勝，必是中國美國等等全部民治國家的協力制勝。因此之故，吾們對於今年的不列顚帝國日，賀以國慶，祝以勝利與繁榮，自信情緒之熱，實不知若干倍蓗於往年！</p>

<p>追念女皇　一生功績</p>
<p>今日爲英國維多利亞女皇誕辰、亦即爲帝國紀念日、本埠英大使館以及英領署各僑商團體、均有熱烈之慶祝、據英大使館中人稱、</p>
<p>政治昌明</p>
<p>英國之建國史、與其他强國之建國史初無二致、經過若干决之艱苦締造與內外戰爭、至維多利亞女皇時期、遂成爲央國之黃金時代、鞏固國內、擴展版圖、幾有英旗遍世界之佳話、女皇即位於一八三七年、年甫十八、至二十三歲、與其中表亞爾培第親王結褵、時親王已即比國王位、夫婦二人、致力於英國文化事業、一八五〇年、組設「大學委員會」、將牛津與劍橋二大學重光爲文化中心、推廣大學敎育與專門敎育於各地、翌年、叉組設國際博覽會於倫敦、以助長工商業之發達、一八五三年增設學藝部、由此工商業之推進、及文化之發展、遂起空前之影響、而國際情調、亦爲之一變、當時少年詩人騰尼孫有「戰旗長捲兮戰鼓無聲、人類團結兮世界大同」之歌頌、</p>
<p>反對侵略</p>
<p>英國之外交思潮、亦有比較公平之傾向、如對俄土戰爭、英乃力主反對俄皇南侵、幷不惜與俄一戰、雖亦其自身打算、而其反對俄皇侵土、不失爲公平之表示、其時倫敦街上有一首口頌耳熱之歌、「吾人不欲戰、如果不能不戰、吾人有船、吾人有兵、而且吾人有金鎊、但俄皇不能有君士坦丁堡」、一八七八年之柏林條約、乃係一種外交思潮之結晶在此條的中、英國固失去土耳共之塞蒲露斯島、但於土耳其仍屬有利、一八八七年、改變殖民地之待遇而有帝國會議、此會直至女皇駕崩後二十五年、始將女皇遺旨、編成一決議、凡「自治領與英帝國爲同等地位之自治會社、統率在皇帝之下、雖各爲英國自治領之一員、得以自由聯合、但內政外交、彼此無從屬之關係」、女皇此種意旨、對英國之世界利益、乃起異常偉大之作用、</p>
<p>復興文化</p>
<p>總之、女皇所促進英國文化之發達、而對於世界人類之供獻、其功爲不可磨滅、（一）一八五九年、達爾文之物種論、係爲生物上劃時代之科學著作、（二）赫胥黎之天演論、雖無達爾文物種論一書之偉大、但其與非科學的舊勢力作戰門精神、要非常人所能企及、（三）騰尼孫與勃郎寗二人、成爲英國文學復興史上之泰斗、亦非偶然、在女皇即位之初、英國文學已感沉寂、賴女皇夫婦之竭力提倡、致成今日文物之邦、吾人飲水思源、故年逢是日、熱烈慶祝女皇誕辰、亦即爲英帝國之紀念日以誌不諼</p>

<p>棉花鋼鐵　產量大減</p>
<p>該文列舉日本去年前八個月一般生產品之百分率、與的年同一時期、作一比較、結果下降三·六、製造品亦下降四·五、一九四〇年前九個月一般棉織品之出品數字、總計爲一·三七三·八二〇、四一四方碼、較一九三九年同時期、降爲百分之二二·一、自一九三九年八月一日起至次年七月三十一日止、進口美棉爲九十萬包、佔外棉進口總額百分之四十、衆信在本年至明年之同一時期、美棉運日、將限於二十五萬包至三十萬包之間、故本年日本棉花方面之消費、將大爲减少、至日本本年之鋼鐵產量、由於電力及汽油之缺乏、亦毫無進展、較前年下降、目廢鐵之不能獲得、以本年爲甚、日政府乃不得不從節减其消費量百分之四十七左右、</p>
<p>各種農產　均見低降</p>
<p>至農產量亦大見下降、一九四〇年度較之一九三九年度降百分之八五、食米產量一九四〇年較一九三九年下降百分之一一·七、　　一九四〇年較一九三九年下降百分之三·六、大麥在同期內則下降百分三、至一九四〇年度生絲總產量估計爲二八九·三八二包、較一九三九年度下降百分之二十五、輸美佔二五四·八一〇包、較一九三九年跌百分之二三·一、</p>
<p>全國將施　計口授糧</p>
<p>關於日本米糧進口、來自中國及東部亞洲者其數的五千一百萬至六千六百萬蒲歇爾（Bushels）因此日政府努力以其他食物爲代替、俾減低國內米糧之消耗、衆認全國性之計口授糧制、將於本年度施行、以統制米糧、並已運用若干增加食米產量之方法、然亦並無圓滿成續、而其殖民地之產米、亦因災患頻仍血减少、故日本將於本年內向外國大量購買、以補不足、</p>
<p>公債增加　貿易不振</p>
<p>再次論日本經濟情形之拮据、可由其貨幣發行額與流通額見之、據稱、一九四〇年日本貨幣流通額增加達一、一一二、三七七、〇〇〇日元、公債購買率下降百分之十二、然公債發行額則增加達六、六六八、〇〇〇、〇〇〇日元、即百分之二十四、最後論美日商約之取消、影響日本對美貿易到巨且深、去年美國有大宗輸出品、如化學用品、機械飛機汽油、鐵及鋼等、均被禁止出口、至於日本對蘇貿易、亦毫無起色、又日本與非日圓集團國之貿易其所得利潤、僅及百分之一、</p>

<p>西洋繪畫的理論、比較切實、唯一的條件、就是科學化、的略可分透視法、構圖法解剖學、色彩學等幾種、透視和解剖相近、在中國繪畫中就是應物象形的意思、構圖法與色彩學在中國繪晝中就是章法、和隨類敷彩的意思現在分別的詳細講一講、在野外寫生找到了對象之後、用透視法來、第一就觀察確定一個固定的地點直綫望去、相當於視綫的就是「地平綫」、同時又要指定一個中心點、一切位置都依據造中心點，這中心點就是目光望去最遠的一點、換言之、就是愈遠愈小、愈近愈大、反之愈小愈遠、愈大愈近、不在視綫以內東西、就不會看見、畫面上就不必畫進去、風景畫如此、動物靜物也是如此、根據了透視的原理作畫、所描寫的對象、一定十分酷肯的、這一點和中國繪畫是絕對不　的、「構圖法」等於中國畫的章法、不論風景靜物、都要顧到畫面的佈置、使臻於最美滿的地步、凡是不適宜於畫面上的東西、應當斟酌的支配一下、譬如畫三個蘋果、平均分佈在一條平錢上、和前後參差分佈、自然後者比較美感、前者比較刻板、其他風景·動物·人物·都要根據這個原則去配合、至於「解剖學」在中國畫方面、並不十分注意、在西洋畫人物寫生的時候、非常重視、不過繪畫上應用的、稱爲「藝用解剖學」牠只研究人體的外形、骨骸的內部組織、無甚關係、而身體的長度、耳目口鼻的部位、偃僂曲背的老人、腰細肩削的美人、所以「藝用解剖學」是繪畫的方法、而不是浮泛的理論、我們應當要明白的、此外「色彩學」、也比中國畫的用色、來得嚴格、須對照對象的色彩、忠實的描寫、各種物體、往往受到光的影響血變化、視感的不同、顏色就沒有一定的標準、（有少數人天生色盲的）同時作者個性也有强烈·溫柔·冷淡的不同、應用色調、也隨之不同、大都個性激烈的人、喜歡用深的色調、個性溫柔的人、喜歡用淡的色調、在每一幀晝面上、須有「統一的色調」、例如畫個春天風景、桃紅柳綠、如果不加「統一」的意味、畫面上就有不調和的刺激性、因此、應用色彩的時候、須顧到這點、這很重要的一椿事情、</p>
<p>最後、藝術是超現實的寄托品、人類往往厭倦現實的、在繪畫上、僅量發揮我們的理想、尤其中國繪畫的表現、更趨於理想而超現實、所以山水晝中、並無洋房汽車的現代產物、人物畫中也無時裝的仕女換言之、藝術是時代的反映、不是時代的奴隸、而是時代的領導者、我們研究圖畫的人、必須加以認識的（完）</p>

<p>— 菲</p>
<p>芳的肺病已進入第三期了。</p>
<p>鮮紅而聳起的顴，配着一張蒼白淸癯的臉，很有幾分病態美。</p>
<p>她自己，常會拿起鏡子，照看她的臉龐，做一個媚笑，再閉着嘴鼓起腮子來，現出並不瘦的樣子。</p>
<p>「您的氣色怪好呀！」她盼望有人讚上一句！</p>
<p>我們對芳的病狀，除了表示惋惜外，簡直不知怎麼說纔好。她是何等地怕聽「肺病」兩個宇！尤其是「第三期」！</p>
<p>是啦，在初期的當兒，我們已經盡着最大的努力勸導過她了，我每天向她唱歌，講趣話，並答應她身體好了後介紹一位男朋友給她。當然，也說到些肺病的療養法，但，她會覺得我們的話是多餘的。</p>
<p>當她躺着的時候，要是我們說上一句「您應該這樣好好的休息纔是」，她會立即爬起床來，往山上跑一個圈子，表示對『肺病』示威。接着，累了，哼了，體溫高了，坐在搖椅上發呆。但她仍是堅持這是連動後必有的現象，與肺病毫不相干。</p>
<p>芳最恨惡我們相她分食。</p>
<p>「我是犯人啦？傭人啦？餐媳婦啦？要分食？」她一點沒有思索到她的菜肴是多麼豐盛，接連地胡鬧了一些時候。有一次，她甚至把她吃剩的菜倒在我的飯碗裏。</p>
<p>「您們硬勁要判決我有肺病，於您們有甚麼益處？」</p>
<p>我們實在沒有加重她對於「肺病」的恐怖觀念，爲着保守一家人的健康起見，我們不能以情感來推翻理智；不管她儘投反對票，分食制必須建立的。</p>
<p>大哥給她一瓶魚肝油，並說了幾句魚肝油中維他命丁和肺的營養，她立刻倒去一半，算是向他的言諭表示抗議。但在沒人瞧見的時候，她會偷偷的喝一匙下去。</p>
<p>我們沒有見過她吃魚肝油，但魚阡油確被吃掉一瓶了！她心裏的矛盾，速她自己也想象不來。</p>
<p>芳不停地看小說，還謅了幾句詩；裏面　樣說：</p>
<p>「我仍是健康的！</p>
<p>病，去吧！盼望我病的人，也去吧！</p>
<p>芳，只有您自己，</p>
<p>知道您是怎樣一個自已！」</p>
<p>我們看出，應該在最大的可能範圍內，竭力避免正面摸着她的病；所以，當小弟弟說「我不願相芳姊玩」的話時，我會給他一個暗示，斥責他一頓。</p>
<p>大哥給她的臥室開一個大窗，告訴她可以多見些對山的烏鴉，而悶住了「陽光和肺的關係」。</p>
<p>這樣，芳會感覺滿意，愉快。</p>
<p>爲了她，全家人都吃玉蜀粉糊，加上葡萄糖，不使她有「爲什麼」的發問。</p>
<p>時間不容她冉「否認」，她的肺病已到了嚴車階級，一天到晚廝守在床上。</p>
<p>她頂願　的喝魚肝油，飴糖，蛋黃；汪射維太命AD，鈣，……她也敞着胸膛晒太陽。</p>
<p>「姊姊，我不相信我的肺病已是第二期了」她到這時期問題還在「吾認」。</p>
<p>是的，我承認恐懼和疑惑是一個有肺病者的大敵，但明明有了病了，還自强自吾認，曾落到史痛苦的深淵中。</p>
<p>芳就是其中的一個！</p>
<h3 id="c53">磁性水雷 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 不知</p>
<p>五月月廿日本刋「科學發明戰」一文中提及德國磁性水雷的發明，按磁性水雷初發明時，英國的海軍當時，　懼異常。磁性水雷長的八呎，直徑爲二呎。飛機和兵艦都能施用這種武器。不過自飛機上投下，碰　洋　時有損壞的危險，所以通常是繫在降落傘上投下的。到了水　它就捨棄降落傘沉下去。</p>
<p>磁性水雷的作用是如此的：水雷中有根磁力很强的磁針仲出來。兵輕經過的時候，它的船底（是鋼鐵製的）就犯磁性水雷吸來，與之相撞，發生一個電力作用，結果使懪炸了。一個磁性水雷中含三硝基甲笨之量約二百餘磅。威力不可謂不大。</p>
<p>英國人在九天後所想出的防禦方法雖未完全公開，但大概的原理是可以告訴大衆的：在船慶四邊，配置一組電綫，它的作用是中和磁性地雷的吸力，使它不能和船申相吸。這是有名的『特考珊帶』（De　Gausse　Girdle）。如果英國的商船都有這種配備（軍艦早已有了），磁性水雷便不過是一個騰史的名字了。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（八）可感的友情</p>
<p>秋海棠不由自主地在枕上向他點了點頭。</p>
<p>「再過三天來淸接你回去吧！」玉崑的影子在很快的門的後面消失了。</p>
<p>直到第二天淸早，秋海棠在破例的睡熟了大半夜之後，才想起自已所交給那個奶媽子的錢已經留得很少，玉崑父是向來窮得混身找不　五塊錢的怪物，那幾天梅寶害病，請大夫吃藥，以及日常的開銷，眞不知是怎樣對付過去的。</p>
<p>「方才懊悔不會給他幾十塊錢！」這個念頭才一轉，他方始想到自己是只穿了一身薄綢的短衫褲進醫院的，後來祇知道紹文替他付了醫院五百塊錢，——一個遠過於自己這次帶上天津來的現款的大數目——還有六張五塊　的鈔蔡塞在他的枕下，此外就想不起目己再有什麼錢了。</p>
<p>因爲想起了錢的問題，不覺又聯想到了袁紹文。</p>
<p>紹文　北京去已經有十一天了，秋海彙的腦海裏差不多也天天在想他，雖然沒有像羅湘綺和梅寶那樣的使他寢食小安，但自從七天前來過一次信以後，從此便查無消息，這一點也的確使他放心不下。</p>
<p>雖然他現在並不急於需用錢，梅寶和那奶媽子的食用也有限得很，王崑無論如何窮，總不致沒有方法維持，可是他對於趙四，榮奎，金大個子和家裏其餘的那些人，却委實沒有一個信任得過。紹文原說回京以後，第一就簪他料理家事，把他臥房裏所藏的現款和存摺一齊收起來，下人至少先打發走一半，行頭也慢慢的設法出賣…！。然而，奇怪得很，紹又七天前來的信上就祇說起見過趙四，別的一個字也不提，後來爽快信也不見再來了。（一一四）</p>

<h3 id="c58">談各大舞塲的爵士音樂 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— 梁兆琪</p>
<p>音樂的確已成爲舞塲的靈魂，故一間舞塲的盛衰，也從音樂之優劣而定。舉一個例說。從前的大新和大華舞廳之茶舞，曾煊嚇一時，實由音樂優良之故。前者由唐喬氏，康脫來拉司，和愛皮可聖托氏共同領導，後者由洛平指揮和柯樂女士伴唱，爲好聽昔樂者最飽耳福的時期。現各大舞塲的音樂，首推唐喬氏，洛平和康脫來拉司。唐喬氏在上海爵士音樂界最有地位，和歷史最久，若使關於海上音樂的變遷和歷史，我相信他是最能了解的一位，還希望他能够寫一點　於這種的文字。唐喬氏最善玩的，是結他和手風琴，指法極熟練，他又善於指揮，且姿勢極佳，全滬爵士音樂界，只可拜其下風。（愛迪稍有他的作風，祇可惜過於懶，終沒有出人頭地，當他稍有振作時，又困於厄運，現好像已離上海。）他又善於訓練人才，現在的洛平，康脫來拉司等，以前都是在他指揮之下，可惜現在他的班底的人才，都　星散，故有獨力難支之嘆。</p>
<p>洛平他有天賦的歌喉和沉毅的精神，他的樂隊都是循規蹈矩，沒有過火之舉動。他的拿手作，就是殺克風和橫笛，而尤善奏勃羅司樂曲，可惜他指揮時的姿勢，過於呆板，很像吃力的樣子。從前他隸於唐喬氏時，唐氏依他如左右手，自從他在逍遙舞廳（即今之余都）客串茶舞時，就是他自作領班之始。不久他就脫離唐氏樂隊，另自組織演奏於大東舞廳，就是他光芒萬丈的時期。直至在仙樂舞廳二年多，他的聲　，還是靑雲直上，由他而想釗海立笙，眞有今昔之感哩。</p>
<p>講到康脫來拉司，他的技能就是能改良樂諾和調合舞客心理，他最得力的就是現在的琴手和非洲黑人的喇叭，但他的樂隊常有不合規的舉動，尤其是這女唱歌者，常常做出一種下流淫蕩的動作。他鵲聲初起的時期，就是在大新舞廳，後來爲身價關條，就轉人維也納，就此名落孫山，曾一道加人璇宮舞廳及聖愛娜原址之某舞廳，亦不得志，後東山再起，崛起於大華舞廳，又復興後再入百樂門，聲署又復减低，望康氏好自爲之。</p>
<p>其次就是湯尼他可，譽爲上海第一名鼓手，還能唱高喉的歌曲，很動總，地從前也是康脫來拉司黃金時代的鼓手，康氏致有今日的地位，湯尼之功不可沒。但湯尼究竟不是一個領班人才，演奏華爾滋音樂極佳，又談到愛普盧，初隸於新華舞廳，演奏多西班牙曲，但不善於唱，又很少見他現玩樂具，有者不過結他一種而已。他離開上海不久，又重演於雲裳舞廳，仍未見出色，現轉往大華，與柯樂女士合作所奏的快音樂，很是起勁。加以柯樂的歌喉，眞是相映成趣。其决如倍納，黑皮及其他樂隊，因未見有超然技能，故不贅述了。</p>

<p>在前些年北方郝（壽臣）侯（喜瑞）派大與的時候，不論伶票兩界，祇要應工花臉，都要宗他們二人，所以到處都能聽見那種沙啞的聲調，及至金少山北返之後，凈行爲之一變，觀衆們從聽　那種沉悶聲調裏，忽然聆到少山的高亮之音，精神爲之一振。所以少山亦一天紅過一天，居然能單獨組班，以花臉戲唱大軸，這完全是由時機所造成。現在生旦兩工正像當初郝候時代，生工裹北馬南麒，和旦工的　調，樣樣都令人聽了悶氣，將來如果有生像劉鴻　，旦似陳號霖，那　高亮聲韻發現在歌臺，在下敢　保，准能大紅特紅，深望一般聰敏的伶工，緹快另闢新途徑，（亦可說是尋舊路）不要專在沉悶氣氛裏找尋出路，因爲現在這種低暗的聲調，將要不受觀　歡迎了</p>

<h3 id="e1">Nazi Paratroopers Gain Foothold; Situation on Crete Critical; British Air Force Ordered to Withdraw Entirely from the Island; But Surrounding Territorial Waters Still Under Control of British Navy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>London According to recent news received here, German paratroopers and airborne troops are still landing on Crete. As of Thursday evening, no German troops had landed from the sea, but Maleme airfield is still under German control. There is no doubt that the enemy has suffered heavy casualties. Fierce fighting continues without interruption. The German attack is aimed at the most densely populated area of the island between Heraklion and Chania. British Prime Minister Churchill said yesterday that the main force of the German airborne troops had landed at Maleme, about ten miles southwest of Chania, where the airfield was occupied. Military sources claim that in the initial stages of the offensive, lines of communication and supplies were practically non-existent. The British general staff is at the front, and artillery units are participating in the battle no less than infantry. The battle situation is extremely tense. The sky is filled with German aircraft and paratroopers. Once a German aircraft lands, it takes off again for a second transport run. The islanders, with their rich local knowledge, are of great assistance in the war effort. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London According to recent news, fierce fighting continues on Crete. The island's residents have spontaneously risen to help in the battle, which has been very effective. Even when German troops land by air in remote areas without troops, every farmer, male or female, resists them. The German aerial assault is now directed at three key points: Heraklion in the central northern coastal region, where they have occupied some houses in the town, but have failed to capture the airfield; Rethymno, where the German attackers have been repulsed; and Maleme, where the Germans seem to have gained a foothold. According to the Cairo Gazette, operations to deal with the situation are now underway. German aerial traffic between Greece and Crete is now being disrupted by British Air Force bombers, which are still attacking German departure points at Greek airfields. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London An official of the British Air Ministry told reporters yesterday that the British commander stationed on Crete has decided to withdraw British fighter planes from the island because the airfield facilities on Crete are poor and few in number, otherwise it would be a waste of aircraft. A small number of inferior airfields cannot provide satisfactory defense if fighter planes are heavily attacked by enemy aircraft. However, British bombers based in Egypt are still attacking enemy airfields from which sorties are launched. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London Since the German airborne invaders occupied Chania (i.e., Heraklion) the capital of Crete, and struck at Maleme airfield, they have established two coastal landing points this morning. The terrible battle has come to an end. The complete withdrawal of the British Air Force from Crete has also been completed. Since the sudden withdrawal of British aircraft from their base on Crete, the skies over the island have been controlled by the German Air Force. However, the territorial waters around the island are still controlled by the British Navy. The Germans have repeatedly attempted to land reinforcements, including tanks and field guns, by sea, but have been repelled by the heavy gunfire from British warships. Two Nazi giant transport ships and numerous other smaller vessels, concentrated in Greek ports, preparing for the final invasion, have been sunk by the terrible gunfire from British warships. The battle is intensifying. It is reported that British, Australian, and Greek troops, with the help of Cretan guerrillas, are counterattacking fiercely. Although Nazi reinforcements arriving by airplane gliders and parachutes are endless, the British defenders and their allies are engaged in fierce fighting with the Germans, and will not repeat the Dunkirk debacle. It is reported that the defenders are trying to drive the Germans out of Chania and Maleme airfield. Fierce fighting is also taking place around Chania, Souda Bay, and Rethymno. The Germans are planning to land in these places. Officials say that the number of casualties cannot be accurately estimated because lines of communication are practically non-existent.

<h3 id="e3">British Prime Minister Reports on the War Situation, Admits Loss of Capital <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>London When the House of Commons was about to adjourn yesterday afternoon, Prime Minister Churchill reported on the current situation of the Battle of Crete. It is said that the battle continues fiercely, and the British army still controls the situation, but the German army has obtained some local victories at a heavy price. The German side uses a large number of airborne transport troops and paratroopers to fight, and the number is increasing day by day. It is now reported that the German army has occupied the city of Heraklion (according to the city is the largest city in Crete, with a population of about 33,000), presumably only a few houses have German soldiers scurrying in and hiding, and the city's airport is still in the hands of the British army. There is no special war situation to report in the Radimo area. Only yesterday (Tuesday) morning, the enemy army attempted to attack the airport there, but it was blocked. In the area from Canea to Souda Bay, the enemy army launched a fierce attack yesterday morning, and paratroopers landed southwest of Canea during the day. He was attacked by British artillery and machine guns. Maleme, the airport ten miles southwest of Canea, and the area west of Coles, now seem to be occupied by the enemy, but the airport is still under artillery fire, and the coastline in the area is still in the hands of the British army. Now the war continues to intensify and will continue for a long time. Last night, the enemy army began to make plans to transport troops by sea to land, but the enemy convoy heading to Crete was intercepted by the British Navy. It should be that four enemy ships, or those carrying troops intended to engage in landing activities, and one enemy destroyer escort were sunk. Today (Wednesday), the enemy launched a large-scale attempt to return troops to Crete to escape, and then launched an attack. There are no follow-up reports on the subsequent war situation, only that the war was fierce during the day, and enemy planes attacked British ships and British ships attacked enemy convoys. The results were endless, but judging from the strength of the British Navy in the Mediterranean, it feels that the results of the attack will be satisfactory,</p>
<p>At this point, a member of parliament suggested that the Prime Minister send a telegram to the troops in Crete to express his admiration and trust. The Prime Minister replied that he would definitely do this. The battle of Crete was peculiar and fierce. The British army had no air assistance, because there was no good airport, not because there were no planes. The enemy has no artillery and tanks, even if there are very few. Neither side has a way to retreat. This is a desperate battle. He must send a telegram to encourage the troops on the island. There is no doubt that they are now engaged in a very important battle, which will affect the entire future of the Mediterranean war. A member of parliament asked the Prime Minister whether the enemy army has no tanks means that the British army has tanks. Churchill replied that he did not expect to be asked this question.

<h3 id="e4">Fierce Sea, Land and Air Battles; Aegean Sea Becomes Major Battlefield <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>London A British telegram from Cairo this morning said that General Freyberg is still in control of the war on Crete. At present, the war on the island is in full swing, because the defenders are constantly defending and dealing with the invading German army, and the sky is full of criss-crossing searchlights and the fire of shells. Last night, the British and Greek troops were tired, but their will was still very firm, and they were still fighting hard to resist the large-scale German air invasion. With the help of searchlights, the defenders quickly continued to fire into the sky to attack the thousands of German paratroopers in blue-black clothes who descended through the dense network of artillery fire. When anti-aircraft guns and Broughton guns fired countless bullets at German planes and descending paratroopers, machine guns kept strafing the paratroopers who had already landed. A Cairo interviewer emphasized that Hitler is doing everything he can to drive General Freyberg's forces out of this besieged island, and to drive the British Navy out of Souda Bay. The Battle of Crete did not stop yesterday, and the Aegean Sea became a major battlefield at the same time, because the British fleet was bombarding a German fleet with a large number of shells. The fleet had a total of 30 troop carriers, supply ships, and escort ships. While the British naval artillery was firing, the Nazi Stuka planes were also bombing British ships with terrible and deafening bombs, in an attempt to make the war favorable to Germany, so that the German troops loaded on the ships could reach Crete by sea, and gain a foothold in Maleme and Gandia. Clifford, a Cairo interviewer for the "Daily Mail", said that the Nazi high command is engaged in a 24-hour ferry work, and is taking careful steps, minute by minute, using airplanes to cross the sea through the sky, traveling between Greece and Crete. Each paratrooper carries a very small radio, to report the situation to its headquarters, because of this, its entire plan can be changed at any time, and the "Times" Cairo interviewer reported that the German attack has failed, and it is estimated that half of the paratroopers found in Crete have been killed, wounded or arrested by the British defenders. (United Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Istanbul The offensive launched by Germany against Crete is being closely watched by all circles here. For example, Congressman Sadak published an article in "Akyam Newspaper", which stated, "Germany's decision to attack Crete is an attempt at a new tactic. If successful, Crete and even the eastern Mediterranean and North Africa will become German bases, and will encourage Germany to adopt the same tactics to attack the British Isles. Therefore, this matter is not just a military victory, but also the success of a new tactic, so as to reduce the importance of maritime hegemony." (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e5">Celebrating the British Empire Day <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the British Empire, which the British call Empire Day. The British Empire includes several kingdoms, self-governing dominions, vassal states, and territories, forming the world's largest complex organization, centered on the Kingdom of England. There are of course many aspects of the political systems and situations of the various parts of the British Empire that can be criticized, but the trend of each part towards civil governance, and the gradual increase of the civilly governed parts, is an undeniable fact. The British Empire is certainly not the creator, ruler, or leader of the world, but it has a broad voice in the world, and many of the world's problems are significantly determined by the British's proposals and actions. This is also an undeniable phenomenon. The world history since the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was almost directly and indirectly constructed by Britain.</p>
<p>Today, the British Empire is facing serious difficulties. His enemy explicitly proclaims that its purpose is to crush Britain; and its multi-faceted military actions have also identified this purpose, doing everything possible, risking lives, to gamble on a single bet. To say that the current situation is a critical moment for Britain's survival is not an exaggeration. Recent wars, in Iraq in the Near East, and on the island of Crete in the Mediterranean, have been fierce, and will almost be decided by hand-to-hand combat; this victory or defeat is not related to the overall situation, the final outcome, or Britain's survival, but its impact can divide Britain into two in the application of its war machine. From this, one must imagine the severity of what he has recently encountered, and today's Empire Day must be spent in such a serious atmosphere. How can all his friendly countries not express great sympathy?</p>
<p>China, the United States, and Britain are located on three continents. The British Empire, composed of Britain and its territories, is closely connected to China and the United States. China and Britain each have enemies to confront militarily, but in the sense of anti-aggression and upholding civil governance, the three countries are standing on the same battle line. In this war, Britain cannot win alone, it must be a cooperative victory of the entire British Empire; if the British Empire cannot win alone, it must be a cooperative victory of all civilly governed countries such as China and the United States. Therefore, we congratulate this year's British Empire Day with national day, wish it victory and prosperity, and we are confident that the heat of our emotions is many times greater than in previous years!</p>

<h3 id="e8">Communist Army Attacks Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi; Cooperates with the Central Army; Zhou Enlai Sends Letter to Ta Kung Pao to Make a Statement <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing The Ta Kung Pao published an article on May 21, urging the Communist Army to immediately assist the Central Army in resisting the Japanese Army in southern Shanxi. This morning, the newspaper published a reply from Zhou Enlai, the Communist Party's representative in Chongqing, stating that the Communist Party will never cooperate with the Ning faction. The Communist Army has begun to attack the Japanese Army in southern Shanxi and is cooperating with the Central Army. The Communist Army last year transported the Commander-in-Chief's order and withdrew to the Zhang River (transliteration) line to avoid friction with the Central Army. Therefore, there are no troops stationed in Zhongtiao Mountain. Zhongtiao Mountain is certainly important, but other mountains are equally important, such as the Guangceng Mountain (transliteration) in the north, which controls the Great Wall, the Wutai Mountain in the northeast, which connects Hebei and Chahar provinces, the Taiyi Mountain (transliteration) in the east, which connects the Hebei Plain, and the Lulian Mountain (transliteration), which protects the southwest of the Yellow River. All should be defended, etc. Ta Kung Pao commented on the letter, expressing its satisfaction with the Communist Army's determination to maintain national unity and fight together, and said that what the people were previously worried about was friction between the Communist Party and the government. When the county's neutral agreement was concluded, they also asked each other whether the Communist Party's future policy would change because of the agreement. Now that the Communist Army is actively cooperating with the Central Army, this kind of doubt will naturally be dispelled. This morning, the Communist Party's organ newspaper Xinhua Daily News published a message saying that the Communist Army began attacking the Japanese Army in southern Shanxi and Hebei on May 12, destroying its transportation lines to assist the Central Army in Zhongtiao Mountain. The Communist Army is particularly active along the highway between Qin County and Jinyang (transliteration). According to front-line war reports, the Japanese army occupying the ferry on the north bank of the Yellow River is now bombing the Chinese army positions on both sides of the river every day.

<p>Chongqing Strictly Prevents Japanese Paratroopers</p>
<p>Chongqing The Air Defense Command recently issued a message stating that in order to prevent the Japanese parachute troops from attacking Chongqing, it is specially stipulated that when this unit is discovered, the police should sound the alarm by knocking on gongs and blowing car horns. All citizens should take out all their weapons after hearing the alarm, and bravely encircle and suppress them together to quickly annihilate them. According to reports, in order to prevent parachute troops, Chongqing has built machine gun positions all over the inner and outer suburbs of the city. Some of them are steel-reinforced concrete, and their shape is slightly similar to that of a Tochka. Usually, the police stand in them as command posts, but the general public does not believe that the Japanese army will disturb Chongqing with parachute troops. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Washington President Roosevelt said yesterday that the United States will build more and faster ships to transport war equipment to various places to help free people eliminate the threats they face. The President wrote a letter to Land, Chairman of the Maritime Commission, saying, "I am pleased to have this opportunity to address the American people in a message about maritime affairs. Never before in American history has the merchant ship been so important to the nation's happiness as it is today. What I mean by important is that it is a decisive tool for survival in our free people's struggle for survival. If we want to prevent the violence that has destroyed the old world and threatens the new world today from invading our country, then most of those who do this work are ships and sailors and shipbuilders. If they fail, the whole situation will fail. My diligent and hardworking Americans, who spend the best part of their lives seeking human safety and happiness, all know that this precious safety and happiness depends only on the success of their efforts. I know that this effort will never fail. More and faster ships will be built in the United States, and driven by trained American sailors, sailing in the public seas to transport war equipment to help eliminate the threats imposed on the free people of all countries."

<h3 id="e10">Organizing Special Task Force Escort; Navy Vice Admiral Appointed as Commander; Naval Affairs Commission Passes Extraordinary Proposal <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The House Naval Affairs Committee yesterday unanimously passed an extraordinary proposal to establish multiple positions for Navy Vice Admirals, to command special task forces undertaking important military missions. Rear Admiral Nimitz of the Bureau of Navigation explained the necessity of this measure to the House Naval Affairs Committee, stating that U.S. ships and aircraft should be divided into special task forces to carry out special missions, with each force comprising several battleships, air squadrons, destroyers, and submarines. As for how these forces will be used, he declined to announce, citing convenience. This sudden move by the Navy Department has led to speculation that such "special task forces" might be dispatched to protect U.S. shipping in the Red Sea, or to undertake other equally important missions. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Observers are speculating whether the U.S. Navy Department will dispatch its best fleets and aircraft stationed in the Pacific to Martinique, Dakar, or even the Red Sea, to strengthen the defense of the Western Hemisphere and aid Britain. Rear Admiral Nimitz told the Naval Affairs Committee that the majority of U.S. naval power is concentrated in the Pacific, and may in fact be "dispersed" to carry out special missions. He said that the "military matters" currently being planned may include a battleship squadron, an air squadron, a destroyer squadron, and several submarines. He also stated that these new command positions are not based on peacetime or wartime systems. In response to questions from the public, he stated that the establishment of these positions is definitely not for just one or two days, suggesting that the Navy Department has a long-term plan.

<h3 id="e11">U.S. Defense Program Enters New Stage; People's Defense Administration Formally Established; Plan to Focus on Domestic Defense <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The U.S. national defense program has entered a new and more alarming phase, as the newly appointed Director of the Civilian Defense Administration, La Guardia, plans to implement a nationwide scheme, focusing especially on defense against air raids, such as preventing fires, traffic obstructions, demoralization, and disruptions to the water supply. The American public's perception of the national defense program has always emphasized and limited industrial development, so that the United States can realize its function as the "arsenal of democracy." However, La Guardia believes that the significance of the national defense program is to make the entire nation immediately and deeply aware of the dangers of modern warfare, and to strive for domestic defense. La Guardia avoided all commentary on foreign policy, declaring to the press that such matters should be discussed by Secretary of State Hull, and that he had no right to speak on them. La Guardia also avoided discussing several other questions, urging reporters to pay attention to when and what to ask. For example, when a reporter asked whether, if the United States were bombed, children should be immediately evacuated from major cities, La Guardia replied that if the reporter's question referred to the current situation, he would definitely answer in the affirmative. However, if the reporter's question referred to the situation six months from now, then the action taken would depend on the circumstances at that time, and could not be handled using current methods. La Guardia stated that he would immediately direct people's attention to defense relating to land, and stated that the executive order establishing this new agency applies to U.S. territory and possessions. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>New York: New York Mayor La Guardia, in his capacity as Director of the American People's Air Defense Corps, issued a proclamation yesterday, explaining that the affairs of the corps are to be carried out in four groups: (1) Public Safety Group, with firefighting and rescue as its primary duties; (2) Medical Group, with organizing hospitals and enlisting doctors to care for the injured as its primary duties; (3) Technical Group, with training to clear bombed areas and maintain the supply of water, electricity, and gas as its primary duties; (4) Inspection Group, with planning population evacuation plans and monitoring order during evacuations as its primary duties.

<p>New York: Colonel Stimson, Secretary of War, yesterday vehemently denounced the Neutrality Act and demanded its immediate revision.

Stimson strongly argued for the urgent need to revise the Neutrality Act in order to aid Britain. He said, "The government, Congress, and other officials must decide on any revision of the Neutrality Act."

<p>Tokyo: Deputy Cabinet Spokesman Ishii announced today that recent Japanese newspapers have attacked the Dutch East Indies for delaying its negotiations with Japan, but such actions cannot be said to reflect the attitude of the Japanese government, and that these negotiations have reached an important stage. Ishii admitted that he was also somewhat aware of recent newspaper speculation that a third country was influencing the Dutch East Indies, but could not announce it. Ishii declared that the main difficulty in establishing some kind of agreement and continuing negotiations was the attitude of the Dutch East Indies government. (United Press, 23rd)</p>

<p>Los Angeles: The British Consulate has today added all Japanese ships, even whaling ships and oil tankers, to the "Shipping Blacklist" (i.e., the list of ships to be opposed). The British authorities are taking this action to strike down all ships suspected of aiding the Axis powers. It is reported that Britain is retaliating against all Japanese oil tankers and whaling ships suspected of supplying fuel to German raiders in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. Shipping industry sources point out that the explorer Bill Southworth has reported traces of German raiders in the South Ocean area frequented by Japanese whaling ships. Several of the world's largest transport ships and oil tankers have been added to the blacklist. This official British announcement was published in the Los Angeles Commercial News. The announcement stated that all chartered ships and freight ships should protect their own interests. If they violate British prohibitions, the British government will take action to prevent them from engaging in trade. British Vice Consul Hollett declined to explain this announcement in detail.

<h3 id="e14">After Announcement of Franco-German Agreement, Eden Warns France; If France Takes Actions Detrimental to Britain, Britain Will Attack France Indiscriminately <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday issued a stern warning to the French people during questioning in the House of Commons, saying that the Franco-German agreement had been announced, and Vichy claimed that it had opened a new stage in Franco-German cooperation, an example of which was undoubtedly the Vichy government's permission for German aircraft to use Syrian airfields. President Roosevelt has made it clear his opinion on this malicious new development in Vichy policy, and the U.S. government has taken precautionary measures regarding French ships in the U.S. The text of Vichy's explanation is ambiguous and contradictory, claiming that its policy of cooperation with Germany is purely political and economic, and that the Vichy government has no intention of attacking Britain or the United States. However, there are facts that cannot be obscured by this explanation. The Vichy government has now embarked on a path that will inevitably lead to France and its colonies' resources and territory being gradually dominated by the enemy, which is not only the enemy of France's former allies, but also the enemy of France itself. The French people must recognize that this policy stains French honor, and believe that France's obedience to Hitler's new order, rather than maintaining and defending its own independence to await the liberation by the victorious allies, will not benefit the future of France and its colonies. The British government is well aware that the French people hold this view. However, the British government must review the actions of the Vichy government. If the Vichy government, in pursuing its announced policy of cooperation with the enemy, takes or permits actions that hinder Britain's war effort or aid the enemy's war effort, then we will of course be free to attack the enemy wherever they are, without distinguishing between occupied and unoccupied territory. Last August, we made it clear to General de Gaulle our determination to fully restore France's independence and greatness when the war is victoriously concluded. Do the French people want to do something to help those who are still continuing to fight, so as to liberate France? Or do they want to rank themselves among the vassals of Germany? This is for the French people to decide for themselves. The audience cheered greatly. A Liberal Party member asked whether the British government would continue to allow food ships to cross the Atlantic, pass through the British blockade, and supply Vichy. Eden replied that he had already stated the principles governing everyone's actions, and that the questioner should not ask him to elaborate. The Lord Privy Seal, Attlee, stated that there was reason to believe that all of France's remaining war equipment was now being supplied to Iraqi rebels, and that it was not just the Syrian authorities who were providing airfields for the enemy's use. However, the British government has not yet fully understood the extent of Vichy's assistance to Germany in Syria. According to the Reuters parliamentary correspondent, there is now evidence of Vichy's aid to Germany. In military terms, the most recent example is Vichy's allowing German submarines to pass through the Rhone River and enter the Mediterranean. In industrial terms, there is concrete evidence that French industry has provided Germany with a great deal of assistance, even more than what French collaborators had planned, such as repairing German tanks and submarines. The French automobile industry is now manufacturing aircraft engines and munitions for Germany. A formal agreement has been established since April 5, with the enemy. The Renault, Citroen, and Peugeot automobile companies are all participating in this matter. At least two of them are manufacturing aircraft parts, motor boats, tank components, and munitions. Vichy's Minister of Economy stated at the opening of an exhibition in Paris that a quarter of France's machinery and electrical supplies industries are now working for Germany. Apart from this, it is now known that a large part of the goods shipped to Marseille are being transferred to German ownership. In the past six weeks, France has handed over 10,000 tons of lead, 8,000 tons of manganese, 38,000 tons of bauxite, 30,000 tons of wool, and 60,000 tons of pharmaceuticals to the Germans.

<p>British Newspaper Believes France is No Different From a Vassal State</p>
<p>The Times of London editorial stated that there is ample evidence to confirm the extent of the collusion between French and German military actions, and that the Vichy government, in its current state, seems unable to and will not refuse any German demands, no matter how humiliating. Vichy has effectively joined the Axis, but without the name. The newspaper mentioned Iraq and the Arab countries, saying that Britain, in these places as in others, stands firm as the only barrier against Hitler's naked imperialism, and as an ally of countries that cherish their independence. The Daily Telegraph reported that it was painful that the people of France and French territories are colluding with their hated and insatiable enemy. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Britain to Intercept French Oil Tanker</p>
<p>London: Britain and Vichy were on the verge of breaking off relations yesterday, and it was reported that British naval patrols, with the permission of the U.S., will intercept the French oil tanker Hirzelia, which is en route from the U.S. to Casablanca, carrying 10,000 tons of gasoline, 2,000 tons of kerosene, and 800 tons of lubricating oil. From Britain's standpoint, the German invasion of Morocco is presumably the reason for forcing Britain to intercept the ship. Several U.S. consular officials are also on board. Although the cargo is not being shipped to Germany, there are fears that it will eventually fall into German hands through trickery. (International News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>French Cabinet Director Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Vichy: Cabinet Director Admiral Darlan delivered a broadcast speech to the nation at 1 p.m. today, stating that the current negotiations between France and Germany concern the fate of our country, and that our country must choose between survival and destruction. Marshal Petain and the government he leads have now chosen the path of survival, and hope that the people will unite to support Marshal Petain's undertaking of national and popular revival. My talks with German leader Hitler were on the orders of Marshal Petain. Hitler has never asked me to hand over our fleet to the Axis powers, nor has he asked us to cede any territory. Since this war was initiated by Germany, the country can support itself independently without external assistance. Our economic cooperation with Germany is entirely voluntary, and its purpose is to restore our country's inherent position in Europe. Our country is a defeated nation, and three-fifths of our territory is occupied by foreign powers. We should not ignore these facts. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>German Commander-in-Chief Arrives in Paris</p>
<p>After going to Paris on the 19th of this month, Vichy Cabinet Director and Minister of the Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Navy, Admiral Darlan, returned here today and immediately met with Marshal Petain to report on the negotiations with the German authorities. Darlan first met with the German Ambassador to France, Abetz, in Paris to continue negotiations. On the 20th of this month, he held a meeting with Army Minister General Huntziger, Minister of Economic Affairs Bouthillier, and the deputy of the Commissioner's Office, Benoist-Méchin, to discuss Franco-German talks. In addition, Parisian newspapers reported that German Army Commander-in-Chief General von Brauchitsch arrived in Paris yesterday, but it was unrelated to Darlan's presence in Paris. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>U.S. Does Not Intend to Take Action Regarding Martinique</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday while receiving news reporters that although evidence of Franco-German cooperation in Europe is increasing, the situation on Martinique Island has not changed, and that the rumors circulating in occupied France that the authorities on Martinique Island have received instructions to prepare for a U.S. attack are fabrications by the German or pro-German side. Hull's remarks seemed to imply that the U.S. does not intend to take any action regarding the island. Hull also said that the recent routine maneuvers of the French aircraft carrier "Béarn" and cruiser "Peloton" have not caused Washington to worry that they will suddenly sail to Europe.

However, Sinclair continued, it is possible that Hess recognized the Duke of Hamilton, as they both enjoy sports, and Hess may have recognized the Duke when the World Sports Games opened in 1936. Sinclair also said that the Duke of Hamilton had not communicated with Hess, because the Duke's actions were very loyal and frank. (United Press, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Grain: Shanghai Rice Flows Inward; Java Rice Shipped to Shanghai <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice once showed signs of prosperity, but after the market price soared, it was suppressed by the release of long positions. Roughly speaking, the price of small refined rice has a guarantee of stability at 110 yuan per municipal council standard. After the market opened in the morning, as Ningbo in the interior continued to ship cargo and Japanese merchants were also absorbing spot and futures, selling to various occupied areas, hoarders and merchants took the opportunity to push up prices. Large customer hoarders were greedy and insatiable, and were still absorbing, causing both spot and futures rice to soar immediately. Yinghua's No. 1 Saigon opened at 140 yuan, then 1.5 yuan, 2 yuan, up to 143 yuan. Broken rice went from 102 yuan to 104 yuan, small refined rice from 131 yuan to 133 yuan. Spot No. 1 Saigon rose from 114.5 yuan to 118 yuan, No. 2 from 110 yuan to 112 yuan, broken rice from 87-8 yuan, up to 90 yuan. Small refined rice opened and immediately rushed out of 110 yuan to 110 yuan and 8 jiao, then increased to 112 yuan, but as soon as the market price was high, hoarders and merchants immediately spit it out, and at the close it returned to 110 yuan, slightly inferior at 108-9 yuan. The stock of Tokyo sharp-end rice was scarce, and only one or two tickets were traded on the sales floor, opening high at 103 yuan, secondary at 100 yuan. Broken sharp-end rice opened high at 99, 89 yuan, and the tertiary grade of broken rice at 78.5 yuan. According to statistics, yesterday's overall price increase was 3 to 4-5 yuan higher than before, but the market closed at noon due to sufficient procurement by all parties, and the momentum had weakened.

Moreover, the foreign rice produced is superior to the foreign rice from Vietnam and Siam, with white and large grains, and sticky when cooked, but it does not expand. Recently, another batch was loaded by the Zizaluya steamer, 360 tons, about 3,700 bags, unloaded at the Puxi Blue Funnel Wharf warehouse. (Zu)</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed prices and other exchanges remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange first tightened and then returned, as after opening in the morning, Chinese speculators flocked to profit and cover short positions, causing spot and this month's US dollar to immediately soften to 5.375 yuan.

Ultimately, the closing prices of both exchanges were the same as the previous day, and daily trading was not brisk.</p>

At noon, it turned to hardening, and the closing price at noon was British exchange at 3 pence 3125, US dollar at 5.40625 yuan.</p>
<p>The result was no change</p>
<p>Although there were bearish rumors after the noon close, Chinese speculators took the opportunity to continuously profit and buy in, repeatedly pushing up May and June US dollars at 5.40625 yuan. Foreign banks' intention to supply recovered weakly, so it was difficult to settle at the same price several times, and it was slightly softened. Finally, it was heard that the Japanese trading house Mitsui sold May at 5.40625 yuan, so it immediately returned to flat.

<p>The public bond black market yesterday still appeared to be weak on the surface, but there was a rumor that a certain Guangdong gang was preparing to absorb a large amount, and the shorts hoped for an uncertain rumor.

<p>The yarn market, which rebounded in the late afternoon of the previous day, fluctuated once yesterday and then declined again. In fact, blocked outlets made people feel discouraged. Therefore, even if there was sufficient strength to hold the market, the environment did not allow it. However, the Hong gang of coarse yarn still had buying appetite, but the trading of 20-count yarn was still undeveloped. The high price for 20-count Shuangma was 1,429 yuan, and the low price was 1,410 yuan.

The final price was 1,424.5 yuan. Currently, the yarn market is in a state of flux. Large investors are optimistic, but actual sales have stopped. Non-industry participants use Shuangma to bet on wins and losses based on the rise and fall of the bid gold.</p>

<p>The situation for spot cotton suddenly turned lively, breaking the gloomy atmosphere of the past two weeks.

According to telecommunications from the production area yesterday, the price for new goods in Gaozhuang was actually 40% higher than old goods, so sellers are taking a wait-and-see attitude and dare not start purchasing.</p>

Baixiangmao soap was 46 yuan per box, and Huangxiangmao soap was 41.5 yuan, without much fanfare.

<h3 id="e34">U.S.-China Trade Week: Student Luncheon Held Yesterday; Chairman Chiang Eagerly Selects True Talents; Bishop Ward Encourages Students Studying in the U.S. <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The American community in Shanghai commemorated the final formal social event of the 7th U.S.-China Trade Week with a "Student Luncheon" organized by the American University Club. The luncheon was held from noon to 2 p.m. yesterday at the American Club on Fuzhou Road, hosting sixty Chinese and American students who will continue their studies in the United States. Bishop Ward of the Methodist Episcopal Church and Shen Siliang, President of St. John's University, both delivered speeches. The chairman of the luncheon was Fei Liepu, President of the American Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai. A band played school songs and other music to add to the atmosphere. It is reported that the "U.S.-China Trade Week" in Shanghai was organized by the American Chamber of Commerce and began on Monday of this week, officially ending on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bishop Ward Earnestly Encourages</p>
<p>Bishop Ward encouraged everyone to strive for advanced studies when they go there, and praised Chairman Chiang, who has the ability to select true talents. Therefore, he hopes that everyone should obtain two things: one is the "Phi Beta Kappa Key" (a Greek letter representing a student organization where only the most outstanding can join), and the other is extracurricular knowledge. Both must be obtained, and one cannot be chosen over the other. Here, we have repeatedly heard various slogans such as Lebensraum (a German term meaning life's time and space), lifeline, and the New Order. However, we believe that the best is democracy, because democracy is self-governance by the people. Perhaps some students believe that democracy also has various shortcomings, but we cannot deny that this representative system is the most needed form of government organization for the people. Bishop Ward finally solemnly stated that no matter what your goals and choices of subjects are, you must not forget the hopes and provisions given to you, and you must be pragmatic in choosing between good and evil.</p>
<p>Shen Siliang Encourages Efforts for the Country</p>
<p>Shen Siliang stated in his speech that those who wish to study in the United States must regard the United States as the most ideal country in their hearts. However, he hopes that everyone will not forget their important responsibilities to their motherland after arriving in the United States. If you go there for the purpose of making money, it is better for you not to go abroad. The city's street sweepers earn eighty yuan a month, and chauffeurs even earn one or two hundred yuan, while many university graduates earn only seventy-five yuan a month. After you arrive in the United States, you should pay attention to the changes in the intentions and wishes of the local American students. This is probably a reflection of the evolution of the international situation. You must pay attention to obtaining this important information, because your responsibility for going to the United States for advanced studies is heavier and greater than that of ordinary people. Today you are students, and tomorrow you will be pillars of society. Therefore, you must choose between good and evil, bring the good back to the motherland, and not bury it in books, and you should strive for the meaning of human existence.</p>
<p>Students Express That They Will Not Fail to Meet Expectations</p>
<p>After Shen's speech, Ms. Zhao, a student from St. John's University, delivered a reply, stating that they understand that the future actions of Chinese students in the United States are very important to the relationship between China and the United States. Then, Ms. Deng, a Chinese graduate of the American School for Girls, delivered a reply, expressing that she deeply knows the great hopes and admiration that the students of the American School for Girls have for China, and she sincerely hopes that Chinese and American students will cooperate closely and move forward.</p>
<p>Citizens Hope That the Authorities Will Directly Purchase Coal</p>
<p>The price of coal in this city is difficult to lower due to manipulation and hoarding by major coal companies and speculators. A resident suggested that the authorities of the two concessions should imitate the plan of purchasing Hong Kong rice and directly purchase bulk smoke-white coal from overseas, find ways to transport it to Shanghai, and resell it to citizens at a fair price so that they cannot raise the price again. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities will send personnel to secretly investigate the amount of coal hoarded by various coal companies as soon as possible, and if hoarding for a long time is found, it is hoped that they will be punished according to the law without any leniency.</p>

<p>Today is the birthday of Queen Victoria of Britain, also known as Empire Day. The British Embassy and the British Consulate in this city, as well as various overseas Chinese commercial groups, have enthusiastic celebrations. According to people from the British Embassy,</p>
<p>Political Prosperity</p>
<p>The history of the founding of Britain is no different from the history of the founding of other strong countries. After some difficult construction and internal and external wars, the era of Queen Victoria became the golden age of the country, consolidating the country and expanding its territory, and there was a good story of the British flag flying all over the world. The Queen ascended the throne in 1837 at the age of eighteen. At the age of twenty-three, she married her cousin Prince Albert. At that time, the Prince had already ascended the throne of Belgium. The couple devoted themselves to the cultural undertakings of Britain. In 1850, they established the "University Committee" to revive Oxford and Cambridge Universities as cultural centers and promote university education and specialized education everywhere. The following year, they established the International Exposition in London to promote the development of industry and commerce. In 1853, the Department of Arts and Sciences was added, and the promotion of industry and commerce and the development of culture had an unprecedented impact, and the international mood also changed. At that time, the young poet Tennyson had a song of "The battle flag is rolled up and the war drums are silent, mankind is united and the world is one."</p>
<p>Opposing Aggression</p>
<p>The British diplomatic thinking also has a relatively fair tendency. For example, in the Russian-Turkish War, Britain strongly advocated opposing the Russian emperor's invasion of the south and did not hesitate to fight Russia. Although it was also its own plan, its opposition to the Russian emperor's invasion of Turkey was a fair expression. At that time, there was a song on the streets of London that was frequently sung, "We don't want to fight, if we have to fight, we have ships, we have soldiers, and we have gold pounds, but the Russian emperor cannot have Constantinople." The Berlin Treaty of 1878 was the crystallization of a kind of diplomatic thought. In this treaty, Britain lost the island of Cyprus in Turkey, but it was still beneficial to Turkey. In 1887, the treatment of colonies was changed and there was an imperial conference. It was not until twenty-five years after the Queen's death that the Queen's will was compiled into a resolution: "The autonomous territory and the British Empire are autonomous associations of equal status, led by the emperor. Although they are all members of the British autonomous territory, they can freely unite, but internal affairs and foreign affairs have no subordinate relationship." The Queen's intention has had an extraordinarily great effect on Britain's world interests.</p>
<p>Reviving Culture</p>
<p>In short, the Queen promoted the development of British culture, and her contribution to mankind cannot be obliterated. (1) Darwin's "On the Origin of Species" in 1859 was a landmark scientific work in biology. (2) Huxley's theory of evolution, although not as great as Darwin's "On the Origin of Species," his spirit of fighting against non-scientific old forces is beyond the reach of ordinary people. (3) Tennyson and Browning became the leading figures in the history of the revival of British literature. It was no accident. At the beginning of the Queen's accession, British literature had become silent. Thanks to the Queen and her husband's efforts to promote it, it has become a country of culture today. We drink water and think of the source, so every year on this day, we enthusiastically celebrate the Queen's birthday, which is also a memorial day for the British Empire to show our gratitude.</p>
<p>Young British Residents in Shanghai Eager to Enlist; Request to Join Naval Reserve</p>
<p>Since learning of the open letter from British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr last Thursday, in which he mentioned that young British residents in Shanghai should weigh the importance of their current work and whether it would be more meaningful to join the war during the current war, it has aroused the sympathy of countless young British residents here. Last week, fourteen people left Shanghai to join the army in Malaya. Now, some British youths staying in Shanghai have requested to join the naval reserve for service. Once there is a vacancy, they will be called into the army for training. It is reported that the authorities' age limit is set at within thirty-five years old.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Yunnan-Burma Bonds Issued in the United States; Granted Special Permission by the U.S. Government; China, Britain, and the United States Cooperate to Build the Kunming-Lashio Railway <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The National Government issued 10 million U.S. dollars of Republic of China 30th Year Yunnan-Burma Railway Gold Bonds to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway. The bonds stipulate an annual interest rate of 5%, and are to be paid off in 25 years. Principal and interest are paid every six months, with interest only being paid for the first three years. The surplus profit of the Yunnan-Burma Railway is used as the fund. The face value is divided into five types: 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan. All are unregistered.</p>
<p>Issued at 98% of face value starting July 1. The issuance of the gold bonds will be promoted to overseas Chinese, especially to overseas Chinese in the United States. It has already been granted special permission by the U.S. government to be issued in the United States, and ordered Kuang Bingshun, the chief representative of the overseas Chinese in San Francisco, to be responsible for handling the circulation of bonds in the United States. The gold bonds will circulate in the U.S. market, and the funds raised will be used to purchase U.S. railway materials for the construction of the Kunming-Lashio Railway. It is reported that the plan to issue Yunnan-Burma Railway bonds was proposed by Dr. Cooley, a U.S. presidential administrative assistant who traveled to China and returned to his country. After the railway is completed, China, Britain, and the United States will cooperate to handle it. As for the section of the railway from Lashio to the Chinese border within British territory, because British materials are difficult to transport to China, it is also decided to purchase U.S. materials for construction.</p>

<p>North-South Goods Industry Closed Yesterday; Workers Demand Rice Subsidy; Business Labor Dispute Deteriorates</p>
<p>There are more than 250 North-South goods stores in this city, with about 3,000 employees. Due to the rising cost of living in recent days, the wages of the employees in this industry cannot maintain their families. They have requested that the employers provide a rice subsidy of five dou per person per month. However, the employers only agreed to give an additional ten yuan per month, so there was no result. In order to urge the employers to implement the request as soon as possible, all employees suddenly went on strike at 10 a.m. yesterday. As employees left the stores, the stores could not operate, and they closed their doors and announced a temporary suspension of business. Customers who were buying goods in the store were also driven out, and the situation was quite serious. After the incident, the employees immediately made two requests, and have already compromised on the request for a rice subsidy of five dou, which are: (1) Add a rice subsidy of 20 yuan per person per month, with a monthly salary of 6 yuan; (2) The conditions previously agreed upon by labor and management are still valid. After the above request was made, the employers are already meeting to discuss a response in order to eliminate the labor dispute.</p>

<h3 id="e38">U.S. Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce Discusses Japan's Economic Status <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Foreign Trade Weekly, published on March 29, was mailed to Shanghai on May 14. It contains an article entitled "Japan's Economic Status Last Year," written by the Far East Group of the Department of Information. It discusses Japan's economic situation, which has revealed a crisis. The article first states that the Japanese government's policy last year was to eliminate all economic freedom and completely control industry by the government.</p>
<p>Cotton and Steel Production Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>The article lists the percentage of general products in Japan in the first eight months of last year and compares it with the same period of the year. As a result, it decreased by 3.6%, and manufactured goods also decreased by 4.5%. The number of general cotton textiles produced in the first nine months of 1940 totaled 1,373,820,414 square yards, a decrease of 22.1% compared with the same period in 1939. From August 1, 1939 to July 31 of the following year, the import of U.S. cotton was 900,000 bales, accounting for 40% of the total import of foreign cotton. It is believed that in the same period from this year to next year, U.S. cotton shipped to Japan will be limited to between 250,000 bales and 300,000 bales. Therefore, Japan's cotton consumption this year will be greatly reduced. As for Japan's steel production this year, due to the lack of electricity and gasoline, there is no progress at all, and it has decreased compared with the previous year. The inability to obtain scrap iron is especially severe this year. The Japanese government has had to reduce its consumption by about 47%.</p>
<p>Various Agricultural Products All Show a Decrease</p>
<p>The output of agricultural products has also decreased greatly. The 1940 output decreased by 85% compared with 1939. Rice production in 1940 decreased by 11.7% compared with 1939. In 1940, it decreased by 3.6% compared with 1939. Barley decreased by 3% during the same period. The total production of raw silk in 1940 is estimated at 289,382 bales, a decrease of 25% compared with 1939. The export to the United States accounted for 254,810 bales, a decrease of 23.1% compared with 1939.</p>
<p>The Whole Country Will Implement Rationed Food</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's rice imports, the number from China and East Asia is 51 million to 66 million bushels. Therefore, the Japanese government is working hard to replace it with other foods in order to reduce domestic rice consumption. It is believed that a national rationing system will be implemented this year to control rice. Some methods have also been used to increase rice production, but there has been no satisfactory result. The rice production in its colonies has also decreased due to frequent disasters. Therefore, Japan will purchase a large amount from foreign countries this year to make up for the shortage.</p>
<p>Increase in Public Debt; Sluggish Trade</p>
<p>Once again, the Japanese government can see the economic situation by the amount of currency issued and in circulation. It is said that the amount of currency in circulation in Japan increased by 1,112,377,000 yen in 1940. The rate of purchase of public debt decreased by 12%, but the amount of public debt issued increased by 6,668,000,000 yen, or 24%. Finally, the cancellation of the U.S.-Japan trade treaty will have a huge and profound impact on Japan's trade with the United States. Last year, the United States banned the export of large quantities of exports, such as chemical products, mechanical aircraft gasoline, iron and steel, etc. As for Japan's trade with the Soviet Union, there is no improvement. The profits earned by Japan's trade with countries outside the yen bloc are only 1%.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Car Horns Are Not Allowed to Use Dual Tones <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth day of the No Noise Publicity Week. According to the Vehicle Affairs Office of the Police Station, very few reports were received. However, most of the owners of loud horn vehicles have not yet gone to the car shops to change to low-volume ones. Article 40 of all traffic regulations (attached later) should also be strictly enforced. Therefore, two horns with combined sound and musical horns are all cracked down on as follows: "Motorcycles must be equipped with a device that can emit an audible and sufficient warning when the vehicle is approaching. The device must be approved by this bureau. No vehicle horn is allowed to exceed one. Except for vehicles of the Fire Department or Police Department, no motorcycle is allowed to use steel gas horns, complex tone horns, or alarms."</p>

<h3 id="e40">Rice Ordered by French Authorities Will Arrive in Full Within a Week; Representatives of the Rice Industry Invited Yesterday to Discuss Sales Methods; Sales Scheduled to Begin on the 1st of Next Month <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, the tribute rice ordered by the French Concession Public Works Bureau from Vietnam will all arrive in Shanghai within a week. The ships carrying the tribute rice are the General Nerfei, which will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, the Bernardin de St. Pierre, which will arrive in Shanghai on the 28th, and the Comandaute Doris, which will arrive in Shanghai on the 30th. The amount carried by each ship is about 50,000 bags. It is scheduled to begin selling on June 1. It is reported that the French Concession authorities invited representatives of the Rice Industry Association yesterday to discuss sales methods, and a decision has been generally made.</p>
<p>Transportation to Western Shanghai Requires a Transportation Permit</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession had previously banned the export of edible rice from the concession due to the sharp increase in rice prices. However, since the Public Works Bureau's foreign rice has arrived and can be used to supply the entire city's food, the ban on transportation to the road construction section outside the concession has also been lifted. According to the person in charge of Xiangmao Foreign Company, which handles the payment and delivery procedures for foreign rice of the Public Works Bureau, reporters said that those who transport the foreign rice of the Public Works Bureau to the road construction section outside the concession must pay attention to the following points: (1) Rice merchants in the road construction area outside the concession who want to transport the foreign rice of the Public Works Bureau to the store, and rice merchants in the concession area who sell the foreign rice of the Public Works Bureau to residents in the road construction area outside the concession must obtain a transportation permit from the Public Works Bureau in advance; (2) The place to obtain the permit is Room 610 of the Public Works Bureau Building on Fuzhou Road, and contact Mr. Yang; (3) The warehouse receipt must be brought for inspection when obtaining the permit. At about 3 p.m. yesterday, the Yonghengchang Rice Shop on Haig Road purchased a truckload of foreign rice from the Public Works Bureau, which was just taken out of the warehouse and planned to be transported to the store for sale. However, when the truck drove to the intersection of Haig Road and Jing'an Temple Road, the guard patrol detained it because it did not have a transportation permit. Later, the rice shop sent someone to report to Xiangmao Foreign Company, and the foreign company told them to go to the Public Works Bureau to obtain a transportation permit, which is expected to be released around the day.</p>
<p>Three Batches of Hong Kong Rice Will Arrive Today</p>
<p>According to accurate information from the shipping industry yesterday, 20,000 bags of the Public Works Bureau's third batch of foreign rice will be loaded on the Taikoo Company's Nanduo and Suzhou rounds today and arrive in Shanghai. The 50,000 bags carried by the Taisheng round were unloaded at the Roosevelt Pier yesterday. Including the previous 100,000 bags, the total number of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai from the Public Works Bureau has reached more than 120,000 bags. The miscellaneous grain stores that ordered foreign rice from the Public Works Bureau must pay off the payment at Xiangmao Foreign Company on the day that the ordered foreign rice ships arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, more than 40 rice shops went to pay. Also, all the rice shops that have sold out the foreign rice of the Public Works Bureau have continued to go to the 17 rice shops designated by the Public Works Bureau to purchase more to meet the market demand.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Static Temple One Post Arrest Public Affairs Handgun Robbed, Barehanded Bandit Attempts to Rob Guard's Handgun and is Captured <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>According to the English Ta Mei Evening News, at 5:25 AM this morning (the 23rd), a Chinese constable, number 1674, on duty in the Public Concession near the Jing'an Temple Road on Haig Road, was suddenly intimidated by three bandits with guns, who robbed him of his public affairs handgun and six bullets, and then swaggered away. By the time the constable received assistance and gave chase, the three bandits had vanished without a trace. Furthermore, at 12:45 PM today, a Chinese constable on duty at number 1034, Lane Gordon, was being followed stealthily by a bandit who attempted to seize his public affairs handgun barehanded. Unexpectedly, the constable turned around, and the bandit, flustered, took to his heels. The constable drew his gun and shouted for him to stop, but to no avail. He then fired a shot, hitting the bandit in the right knee, leading to his capture. He was then taken to the Gordon Road Police Station.</p>
<p>Dancing Queen Xiao Ying Accused of Fraud</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoying, a red dancer from Weigong Dance Hall at 33 Ningbo Road, is from Huzhou, Zhejiang, and is in her early twenties, possessing considerable charm. She currently resides at number 4, Tongkang Lane, Min Te Ni Yin Road in the French Concession. In March of last year, she met a dance patron named Zhang Lireny in the dance hall, and they became very close. Last month, the woman claimed to Zhang that a friend needed to borrow 6,000 yuan in cash for urgent use. Zhang generously agreed and lent her the full amount. The woman also stated that she would return the money in two weeks. However, she did not return the money by the deadline and avoided meeting him. Yesterday evening, Zhang encountered the woman at the entrance of the Cangzhou Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road. Zhang demanded the money from the woman, who continued to make excuses. They parted unhappily. Unexpectedly, the woman immediately reported to the French Concession Police that she had been beaten and injured by Zhang. The police sent detectives to arrest Zhang, but found no injuries on the woman. Zhang then counter-sued, and the police accused the woman of fraud, claiming that she had borrowed between 20,000 and 30,000 yuan from him in succession after they met, requesting an investigation. The police, finding conflicting statements, decided to detain both parties for investigation.</p>

<p>Wu Wenying (aka Little Beauty), a guide from the Xihu Guide Agency at number 5, Sanyuan Lane, Shantou Road, who is from Hangzhou, always wears several gold rings when she goes out on assignments, which attracted the attention of robbers. In the afternoon, at 5 PM the day before yesterday, a guest from room 311 of the Dahua Hotel at 250 Zhili Road hired Wu to go there. Wu immediately went. At the time, there was only one guest in the room. After chatting for a short time, they went out together to watch a movie. They didn't return to Dahua until 11 PM. Not long after, two thugs suddenly broke into the room. Each of them produced weapons and robbed Wu of three gold rings worth several hundred yuan. Wu shouted for help. The guest who hired Wu suddenly joined forces with the three thugs and fled. Wu chased after them, and Xue Youwen, a veteran Chinese detective from the old police station, happened to be in the hotel and helped to apprehend them. As a result, Xu Qingfeng from Yong was arrested. A fake box cannon and a fake pistol were found on his person. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the defendant had also confessed to committing many other robberies at the police station, but due to time constraints, he requested permission to reschedule the hearing. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered the defendant to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>Wang Juanjuan, a dancer living at No. 19, 2nd Floor, Lane 138, Ximen Road, who was arrested by the Japanese together with the French Police the other day, was arrested because someone accused her of running away. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, Wang Juanjuan is 19 years old this year. She used to be a singer in Nanjing. Later, she met someone, and after coming to Shanghai, because the person she met cut off her financial support, she moved to Ximen Road to live with her mother, Wang, and worked as a dancer for a while, and then dropped out. Now, the person she met accused her of running away, so she and her mother, Wang, were arrested the other day. Wang was released on the same day, but Wang Juanjuan was still detained at the Lujiawan Police Station until last night. However, one side suspects she is a spy, and the truth is still difficult to ascertain.</p>

<h3 id="e50">How to Study Pictures (5) Shi Chongpeng <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The theory of Western painting is more practical, and the only condition is scientification. It can be roughly divided into several kinds: perspective, composition, anatomy, and color science. Perspective and anatomy are similar. In Chinese painting, it means to represent the image of things. Composition and color science in Chinese painting mean composition and color application. Now I will explain them in detail separately. After finding the object for sketching in the field, use perspective. First, observe and determine a fixed location. The straight line of sight is equivalent to the line of sight, which is the "horizon". At the same time, a center point must be specified, and all positions are based on the center point. This center point is the farthest point in sight. In other words, the farther it is, the smaller it is, and the closer it is, the bigger it is. Conversely, the smaller it is, the farther it is, and the bigger it is, the closer it is. Things that are not within the line of sight will not be seen, and there is no need to draw them on the picture. This is the same for landscape paintings, animal still lifes, etc. Drawing based on the principle of perspective, the object described must be very cool, which is absolutely different from Chinese painting. "Composition" is equal to the composition of Chinese painting. Whether it is landscape still life, we must take into account the layout of the picture to make it the most perfect. Anything that is not suitable for the picture should be carefully allocated. For example, drawing three apples, evenly distributed on a flat line, and distributed with front and rear differences, naturally the latter is more aesthetic and the former is more rigid. Other landscapes, animals, and characters must be matched according to this principle. As for "anatomy", Chinese painting does not pay much attention to it. It is very important in Western painting when sketching characters. However, the application in painting is called "artistic anatomy". It only studies the external form of the human body, and the internal organization of the bones has nothing to do with it. The length of the body, the position of the ears, eyes, mouth, and nose, the hunched and curved back of the elderly, and the slender waist and thin shoulders of the beauties, so "artistic anatomy" is a painting method, not a superficial theory. We should understand this clearly. In addition, "color science" is also more strict than the color usage in Chinese painting. It is necessary to compare the colors of the objects and describe them faithfully. Various objects are often affected by light and change. Due to the different visual senses, there is no certain standard for colors (a few people are born colorblind). At the same time, the author's personality also has strong, gentle, and indifferent differences, and the application of colors also varies. Most people with intense personalities like to use dark colors, and people with gentle personalities like to use light colors. There must be a "unified color" on each picture. For example, if you draw a spring landscape, peach red and willow green, if you don't add a "unified" meaning, the picture will have uncoordinated stimulation. Therefore, when applying colors, you must take this into account, which is very important.</p>
<p>Finally, art is a supernatural sustenance. Humans often get tired of reality. In painting, we only measure the amount of our ideals, especially the expression of Chinese painting, which is more ideal and supernatural. Therefore, there are no Western-style houses and modern products of cars in landscape paintings, and there are no fashionable ladies in character paintings. In other words, art is a reflection of the times, not a slave of the times, but a leader of the times. We who study pictures must recognize this (end)</p>

<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>On May 18th, when the United States was holding "China Week," the entire nation simultaneously held "I am an American Day," reminding the public not to forget that they are Americans, and not to forget the American's responsibility to America, and the responsibility to the world. The significance is profound.</p>
<p>Some people think that if a "I am a Chinese Day" could be held in Shanghai, so that a portion of Chinese people who think they are not Chinese or forget they are Chinese, could remember that they are Chinese, that would be a work of immeasurable merit.</p>

<p>Fang's lung disease has entered its third stage.</p>
<p>Her bright red and prominent cheekbones, matched with a pale and thin face, had a certain morbid beauty.</p>
<p>She herself would often pick up a mirror, look at her face, make a charming smile, then close her mouth and puff out her cheeks, showing that she wasn't thin.</p>
<p>"Your complexion looks really good!" She hoped someone would compliment her.</p>
<p>Regarding Fang's condition, besides expressing regret, we simply didn't know what to say. How afraid she was to hear the two words "lung disease!" Especially "third stage!"</p>
<p>Yes, in the initial stage, we had already tried our best to persuade her. I sang to her every day, told her jokes, and promised to introduce her to a boyfriend after she got better. Of course, we also mentioned some methods of treating lung disease, but she felt our words were superfluous.</p>
<p>When she was lying down, if we said, "You should rest well like this," she would immediately get up and run around the mountain, demonstrating against "lung disease." Then, tired, groaning, and with a high temperature, she would sit in a rocking chair, staring blankly. But she still insisted that this was a normal phenomenon after exercise, and had nothing to do with lung disease.</p>
<p>Fang hated us sharing food with her the most.</p>
<p>"Am I a prisoner? A servant? A kitchen wife? To have to share food?" She didn't even think about how rich her dishes were, and continued to make a fuss for a while. Once, she even poured her leftovers into my rice bowl.</p>
<p>"What good does it do you to insist on judging that I have lung disease?"</p>
<p>We really didn't want to increase her fear of "lung disease." For the sake of protecting the health of the whole family, we couldn't overturn reason with emotion; no matter how much she voted against it, the food-sharing system had to be established.</p>
<p>My eldest brother gave her a bottle of cod liver oil and said a few words about the Vitamin D in cod liver oil and lung nutrition. She immediately poured out half of it, as a protest against his words. But when no one was looking, she would secretly drink a spoonful.</p>
<p>We never saw her eat cod liver oil, but a bottle of cod liver oil was indeed consumed! The contradiction in her heart, even she herself couldn't imagine.</p>
<p>Fang kept reading novels and even composed a few lines of poetry, which said:</p>
<p>"I am still healthy!</p>
<p>Illness, go away! Those who hope I am sick, go away too!</p>
<p>Fang, only you yourself,</p>
<p>Know what kind of person you are!"</p>
<p>We realized that we should, to the greatest extent possible, try to avoid directly touching on her illness. Therefore, when my little brother said, "I don't want to play with Sister Fang," I would give him a hint and scold him.</p>
<p>My eldest brother opened a large window in her bedroom, telling her that she could see more crows on the opposite mountain, but kept quiet about "the relationship between sunlight and the lungs."</p>
<p>In this way, Fang would feel satisfied and happy.</p>
<p>For her sake, the whole family ate cornstarch paste with glucose, to prevent her from asking "why."</p>
<p>Time didn't allow her to "deny" any longer. Her lung disease had reached a serious stage, and she spent all day in bed.</p>
<p>She was very willing to drink cod liver oil, malt sugar, egg yolk; inject Vitamin AD, calcium… She also exposed her chest to the sun.</p>
<p>"Sister, I don't believe my lung disease is already in the second stage," even at this stage, the question was still "denial."</p>
<p>Yes, I admit that fear and doubt are the great enemies of a person with lung disease, but to clearly have the disease and still stubbornly deny it, has fallen into a deep abyss of pain.</p>
<p>Fang is one of them!</p>
<h3 id="e53">Magnetic Mines <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Unknown</p>
<p>The article "Scientific Inventions in War" published in this journal on May 20th mentioned the invention of German magnetic mines. When magnetic mines were first invented, the British Navy was extremely afraid. The magnetic mine is eight feet long and two feet in diameter. Aircraft and warships can use this weapon. However, when dropped from an aircraft, there is a risk of damage when it hits the ocean, so it is usually dropped tied to a parachute. When it reaches the water, it abandons the parachute and sinks.</p>
<p>The function of a magnetic mine is as follows: there is a magnetic needle inside the mine with a very strong magnetic force extending out. When a warship passes by, its hull (made of steel) is attracted to the magnetic mine, colliding with it, causing an electrical effect, resulting in an explosion. A magnetic mine contains approximately two hundred pounds of trinitrotoluene. The power cannot be said to be small.</p>
<p>Although the defense method devised by the British nine days later has not been fully disclosed, the general principle can be told to the public: a set of wires is arranged on the four sides of the ship's hull, its function is to neutralize the magnetic force of the magnetic mine, so that it cannot attract the ship. This is the famous "De Gausse Girdle." If British merchant ships are equipped with this (warships already have it), the magnetic mine is nothing more than a terrifying name.</p>

<p>(8) Palpable Friendship</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia nodded involuntarily on the pillow.</p>
<p>"I'll come pick you up in three days!" Yu Kun's shadow disappeared quickly behind the door.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the next morning, after Autumn Begonia had slept unusually soundly for most of the night, that he remembered that the money he had given to that nanny was running low. Yu Kun's father had always been so poor that he couldn't even find five dollars on his person. During the days when Mei Bao was sick, paying the doctor and buying medicine, as well as daily expenses, he really didn't know how they had managed to cope.</p>
<p>"I regret not giving him a few dozen dollars!" As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he began to realize that he had only worn a thin silk shirt and pants when he entered the hospital. Later, he only knew that Shao Wen had paid five hundred dollars for his hospital fees—a sum far greater than the cash he had brought to Tianjin this time—and there were six five-dollar bills stuffed under his pillow. Besides that, he couldn't remember having any more money.</p>
<p>Because he thought of the money problem, he couldn't help but think of Yuan Shao Wen.</p>
<p>Shao Wen had been gone to Beijing for eleven days. Autumn Begonia had been thinking about him almost every day, although not to the extent that he was so restless that he couldn't sleep or eat, like Luo Xiang Qi and Mei Bao. But since he had sent a letter seven days ago, there had been no news at all, and this did make him feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Although he was not in urgent need of money now, the food for Mei Bao and the nanny was very limited, and no matter how poor Wang Kun was, he would always find a way to manage. However, he really didn't trust Zhao Si, Rong Kui, Jin Da Gezi, and the rest of the people at home. Shao Wen had originally said that after returning to Beijing, he would take care of the family affairs first, collect all the cash and passbooks hidden in his bedroom, dismiss at least half of the servants first, and then slowly find a way to sell the belongings…! However, strangely enough, Shao Wen's letter from seven days ago only mentioned seeing Zhao Si, and didn't mention a single other word. Later, he didn't even see another letter. (114)</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of war between England and Germany, the air forces of both sides have been engaged in fierce battles. Recently, a strange ship was found drifting on the sea off the British coast. After investigation, it was confirmed to be a floating clinic for rescuing German airmen. There were four beds, medicines, and food on board. When German airmen's planes were shot down and crashed, they could land near the floating clinic and wait in the clinic for rescue planes to come.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Talking About the Jazz Music of Major Dance Halls <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Zhaoqi</p>
<p>Music has indeed become the soul of dance halls, so the rise and fall of a dance hall is also determined by the quality of the music. To give an example, the tea dances at the Daxin and Dahua dance halls were once very popular, and this was really due to the excellent music. The former was led by Tang Qiao, Kang Tuo La Si, and Ai Pi Ke Sheng Tuo Si, and the latter was conducted by Luo Ping with accompaniment vocals by Ms. Ke Le, which was the best time for those who enjoyed good music to feast their ears. Currently, the best music in major dance halls is led by Tang Qiao, Luo Ping, and Kang Tuo La Si. Tang Qiao is the most established and has the longest history in the Shanghai jazz music scene. If one were to talk about the changes and history of music in Shanghai, I believe he is the one who knows it best, and I hope he can write a little about this type of writing. Tang Qiao is best at playing the guitar and accordion. His fingering is extremely skilled, and he is also good at conducting, and his posture is excellent. In the entire Shanghai jazz music scene, everyone can only be inferior to him. (Aidi has a bit of his style, but unfortunately, he is too lazy and never made a name for himself. When he showed a bit of energy, he was trapped by bad luck and now seems to have left Shanghai.) He is also good at training talent. Luo Ping, Kang Tuo La Si, and others were all under his direction before. Unfortunately, the talents in his band have scattered, so he has to sigh that it is difficult to support everything alone.</p>
<p>Luo Ping has a natural singing voice and a determined spirit. His bands are all well-behaved, without any excessive actions. His best instruments are the saxophone and flute, and he is especially good at playing Borrow Silk music. Unfortunately, his posture when conducting is too stiff, looking very labored. When he used to be under Tang Qiao, Tang Qiao relied on him like his right and left hands. Since he guest-starred in tea dances at the Xiaoyao Dance Hall (now Yudu), that was the beginning of his leading his own band. Soon, he left Tang Qiao's band and organized his own band to perform at the Dadong Dance Hall, which was the period of his great brilliance. Until more than two years at the Xianle Dance Hall, his reputation was still rising steadily. Thinking of Zhao Hai Li Sheng from him, one really has a sense of the past and present.</p>
<p>Speaking of Kang Tuo La Si, his skill is being able to improve music and harmonize with the psychology of dance guests. His most capable members are the current pianist and the African American trumpet player, but his band often has non-compliant actions, especially the female singer, who often makes a kind of vulgar and obscene movements. The period when his reputation first rose was at the Daxin Dance Hall. Later, due to salary issues, he moved to Vienna, where his reputation fell. He once joined the Xuan Gong Dance Hall and a certain dance hall at the original site of Saint Anne, but was also unsuccessful. Later, he made a comeback and rose at the Dahua Dance Hall, and then after the restoration, he entered the Paramount, but his reputation decreased again. Hopefully, Kang will take care of himself.</p>
<p>Next is Tony, who is known as the number one drummer in Shanghai. He can also sing high-pitched songs, which is very moving. He used to be the drummer in Kang Tuo La Si's golden age. Kang's achievements today cannot be separated from Tony's contributions. But Tony is not a leader. He plays waltzes extremely well. Talking about Ai Pu Lu, he was originally in the Xinhua Dance Hall, playing mostly Spanish songs, but he is not good at singing, and he is rarely seen playing instruments, except for the guitar. After leaving Shanghai for a short time, he re-performed at the Yunshang Dance Hall, but he still didn't stand out. Now he has moved to Dahua, and the fast music he plays with Ms. Ke Le is very exciting. Coupled with Ke Le's singing voice, it is a perfect match. As for Bei Na, Hei Pi, and other bands, because they have not been seen to have outstanding skills, they will not be mentioned in detail.</p>

<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Recently, Errol Flynn and his wife had an argument, simply because they were going to have a baby. Errol Flynn hoped to have a boy, but his wife hoped to have a girl. The two sides quarreled a lot. Fortunately, their relatives came up with a way to please both sides: hoping that they would have twins—a boy and a girl. Thus, they calmed down and finally resolved the dispute.</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Transformation of Sheng and Dan Roles <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang He</p>
<p>In the past few years, when the Northern Hao (Shouchen) Hou (Xirui) school was dominant, no matter in the professional or amateur circles, as long as one played the Jing (painted face) role, they had to follow the style of these two people. Therefore, everywhere one could hear that hoarse tone. When Jin Shaoshan returned to the north, the Jing role changed. Audiences, after listening to that dull tone, suddenly heard Shaoshan's high-pitched voice, and their spirits were lifted. Therefore, Shaoshan became more and more popular every day, and was even able to form a band on his own and perform the Jing role as the main act. This was entirely created by the times. Now, the Sheng (male) and Dan (female) roles are just like the Hao Hou era. The Sheng role's Northern Ma (Lianliang) Southern Qi (Lin), and the Dan role's tone, all make people feel stuffy when they hear them. In the future, if there are Sheng roles like Liu Hongsheng, and Dan roles like Chen Hao Lin, those high-pitched sounds will appear on the stage. I dare to guarantee that they will definitely become very popular. I deeply hope that the clever actors will quickly find a new path (which can also be said to be finding an old path). Don't just look for a way out in the depressing atmosphere, because this kind of low and dark tone will no longer be welcomed by the audience.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Xu Jingyan's Charm <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>Don't underestimate the people in the entertainment field, there are indeed many talents inside, but they are still waiting for knowledgeable people to discover them. Bai Yu Yan and Lin Yan Wen are prominent examples of this. Now let me talk about Jing Yan Jiao.</p>
<p>Yan Jiao is just twenty-eight years old, with a beautiful face. This spring, she was hired by the Great World to replace Yu Yan's vacancy. Although young, her mastery of martial arts surpasses Yu Yan in many ways. Jin Shan Temple, Bei Han Wang, and Gong Yuan Lu are all her masterpieces. Her lithe figure, thrilling moves, fluent dialogue, and melodious singing voice, the conditions for a civil and martial Dan (female) role, are all handled by her alone. Whether it is a noble lady, a small family jasper, a female hero, or a chaste woman, her performance is always lifelike. With such a talented person, if she can work hard every day to seek further improvement, will she not become a formidable opponent of Yu Yan in the near future? And will she not be able to stand on an equal footing with Yu Yan and create her own unique style? Yan Jiao, may you strive for this! (Reward)</p>
<p>Brief News: Shanghai female painters Chen Xiaocui, Gu Fei, Xie Yuemei, and Feng Wenfeng, will hold their second four-person calligraphy and painting exhibition at the Daxin Painting Hall from May 26th to June 1st. There will be more than 300 works on display, as well as more than 100 fan paintings. The works are all exquisite and perfect.</p>

<p>(7) Ma Lianliang</p>
<p>In recent years, Ma Lianliang can be considered the most famous actor of Lao Sheng (old male role) coming from the North. Ma's courtesy name is Wenru, and his alias is Fufeng Guanzhu. He is a devout Buddhist and an outstanding talent from the first class of the Fuliancheng Troupe (at that time, the Fuliancheng Troupe was still named Xiliancheng). He initially studied the Wu Sheng (male martial role) under Ru Laiqing (i.e., the grandfather of Ru Fulan and Ru Fuhui), but was not very successful. Later, Cai Yuting taught him the Lao Sheng roles. After graduating from the troupe, he also learned from Sun Juxian and Jia Honglin, and his skills improved day by day. His first trip to the South was with the Yiyuan Stage, and he was immediately appreciated by those who knew the music. His voice is not very high, but his singing is pleasant, full of charm, and his appearance is good. His deportment is also elegant and refined. He excels especially in plays that emphasize acting and dialogue. He can fuse various schools and create his own Ma style. In recent years, there has been a decline in Lao Sheng talent. Shu Yan (Tan Xinpei) has retired, Qing Kui (Wang Youchen) has lost his voice, and Ma Lianliang can be considered the number one who can form a troupe with Lao Sheng roles as the main act and stand on an equal footing with Dan (female) roles.</p>

<p>Labor is a factor of production. Labor must be devoted to one's work, so that production efficiency reaches its peak, and at the same time, the quality of work also reaches the standard of perfection.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Why Did You Come to the Ends of the Earth?</p>
<p>Liu Yining quickly put down Xu Jing's hand that was reaching for the wine cup and said, touching his own wine cup, "Xu Jun, I've already said that I have a shallow alcohol tolerance, and if I drink any more, I'll be very drunk. Xu Jun has a generous capacity, so feel free to drink your fill." Xu Jing said, "I've also had enough to drink. Thank you for the delicious food, let's eat." So he drank another cup. Liu Yining did not urge him to drink anymore and ordered the young maid to serve two bowls of rice. He said to Xu Jing with a smile, "People in the Jiangnan region often eat rice, but since I came to the north, it's been hard to eat this rice. Tonight, my aunt specially cooked this rice because there is a guest from afar, so please eat more of it, Xu Jun." Xu Jing said, "Thank you to your aunt for her kindness, I will certainly eat my fill." So he ate three bowls of rice before raising his chopsticks to rest them on the bowl to show his gratitude. The young maid came over to clear away the leftovers and served fragrant tea. The two sat and chatted idly. Xu Jing then recounted how he had met Zhang Cangqiu, Li Xin, Chen Fei, and others in Qixian County, and how they had sworn brotherhood, as well as how Zhang and Chen had gone to Shanhaiguan to join the army, and how Li Xin had been captured by Hongniangzi on Mount Qingshi, all in great detail. He only concealed the fact that he had come here to seek refuge with Wang Yongtai. Liu Yining listened with excitement and said, "All within the four seas are brothers. It is an even greater joy to meet heroes. It is a pity that I have not met Zhang Cangqiu and the others." Xu Jing said, "If there is a chance in the future, I will certainly introduce them. My meeting with Brother Liu is also a very coincidental matter. If Brother Liu does not dislike it, I would also like to swear an oath of brotherhood with Brother Liu." Liu Yining smiled and said, "Since Xu Jun values me so much, I also have this intention. We don't need to worship the gods, we can just make a promise to each other. How old are you this year, Xu Jun?" Xu Jing said, "I must first ask Brother Liu's age, I suppose Brother Liu is younger." Liu Yining smiled and said, "I am nineteen years old this year." Xu Jing said, "Then I am older by one year." Liu Yining said, "Since Xu Jun is older, naturally Xu Jun is the elder brother and I am the younger brother. From now on, we will address each other as brothers, please don't be polite." Xu Jing said, "In that case, I am ashamed and apprehensive. I have only added to my age, and my scholarship is lacking. I cannot govern with my pen, nor quell rebellions with my martial skills, I am very ashamed." Liu Yining said, "I see that older brother is extraordinary and not one to be under others for long, I only hope that older brother will work hard." Xu Jing said, "I am grateful for younger brother's mistaken praise, I will certainly encourage myself even more. If I become rich and noble, let us not forget each other." The two talked for a long time, and it was nearly midnight. (71)</p>
