<h3>貨幣與戰時經濟</h3>
<p>貨幣之於人生息息攸關，諸凡衣食住行所需之生產與消費，靡不賴貨幣之斡旋而成立，即人生七情六欲之所寄，亦莫不反映於金錢勢力之發揮。生活與社會愈臻複雜，貨幣之運用亦更感棘手，蓋其使命愈多，責任愈重，必使方向迷亂而運用失其把握，遠不如貨幣草創時代功用之單純，而易於完成其任務矣。貨幣應有之功用旣未能秦效，現代之問題復層出不窮而未能為之解決，幣制之進步顯然未能配合人類之進化，彰彰甚明，平時如此，戰時亦然，是乃今日貨幣中心問題之範疇。今先攷貨幣之功用，而究其問題之癥結所在，再進而闡述其戰時之條件。</p>
<p>原貨幣之發軔目標明期，而功用固定。由於人生之不能自給自足。分工合作之道尙矣，於是思所以懋遷有無，而假手於貨幣為交換之媒介，此其功用一。嗣交易制度漸决發展，交易媒介之地位益形重要，而計及此人人所信託之媒介必具有其本身之價値，始可維持其流通，且此媒介之價値必須能永久保持，庶授受者得隨時行使其功用，而易以其他必需之物品。此幣質本身之價値猶如財富之倉庫，此其功用二。惟交易之媒介必須維持其交易之水準若今日以一單位之貨幣可交換一單位之食物，則來日之交換率亦必如此而始可完成其功用。換言之，交易之媒介並非為無規則之交易；反之，必須使貨幣為價値之尺度，此其功用三。</p>
<p>統上三點為平時之貨幣功川。惟揆諸現實，貨幣與物品交易旣無固定比率可以維持，反映物價之消長毫無限制，其三種功用皆未圓滿奏效，固可一覽無餘。顧後人運用貨幣之最大缺點，莫甚於不將貨幣用於生產之道，而以為貨幣博貨幣即為生財大道是也。第不知貨幣之運用原為週轉貨物，若無貨物或無生產，即無所用其週轉，而貨幣自無用武之地。進言之，貨幣代表物資，絕無獨立存在之餘地。今人每多誤解其功用，以為有其獨立之價値，隨時可以易取貨物，而不知貨物生產之道早已阻塞，物稀為貴，幣多而賤，此即貨幣之中心問題也。</p>
<p>再言戰時之貨幣，在歐洲各國運用上雖多進步，但因襲舊說，墨守成規者大有人在，以致貨幣之運用非但不能適應戰時之環境，抑且阻撓戰時經濟之急需。在此飛機大砲下苟安生活之際，而猶欲以能否生利為舉辦某種事業之準繩，是誠屬大謬。設以耕種無利可圖而作罷議，豈非迫令人民為餓莩乎？杲類矛盾之議論與設施全由於傳統思想之荼毒，今主張澈底改革貨幣制度而擊破傳統學說者，英人士倡導甚力。</p>
<p>按英人最前進之思想，戰時之貨幣功用與平時截然不同。戰時之功用僅為消極的與積極的二種，第一種功用之實現在於使貨幣勿阻撓物質問題之解決。換言之，凡欲生產或購置某種物品，在貨幣計算上是吾遭受損失，槪置勿論。第二種功川之實現在於平均分攤戰時之損失，即吾人所謂有錢出錢，有力出力，但各種犧牲之分配務求其平，是即今日英人士所急待解決者也。在平時，工作與利得相依為命，故重利之念尙未可厚非。但在戰時，工作與利得不可併為一談，故戰時之經濟絕不可以生利與吾為前提。</p>
<p>綜上各點，一言以蔽之，貨幣之所以成問題皆由於不察其代表之背景為何物。今日主張取銷貨幣制度者、固不乏人；如不予取銷，則必馭其運用，以增加生產而為人類謀幸福，是皆世人之期望於貨幣也。</p>
<h3>美決不背棄中國　美日談判陷停頓　東報認外交折働未絕望　日樞密院召開重要會議</h3>

<p>路透社二十二日東京電　神戶英文日本紀事報數月前山日人向英商購得、日者載文對於華盛頓之美日談話頗抱樂觀、謂現有徴象、表示英美了解日本較前稍佳、吾人對於日本與其太平洋之大對抗國彼此間爭點之嚴重性、雖不願使自已或他人存有幻想、但有種種因素、可使吾人希望縱在此至遲一小時、仍可商獲滿意之妥協、衆並希望此决談話、非至確然明瞭調解萬不能成功時勿予決裂、該文末復歡迎古柏之來遊遠東、及李特爾頓之被任為中東英軍政治顧問、謂此種行動、足以表明英政府願對世界該部分之和平的政治可能性、作更密切之接觸、而不欲完全委　不顧政治影饗、從事種　運動之軍人云、</p>

<p>近來報章上、多說黑匯已消滅、大有「引經據典、　」好似說來頭頭是道、以爲實有其事、但事實是如此、連日黑黑匯時有成交、昨日東方匯理銀行又售出美金爲四元六二五、由不准聲請之某洋行買進、且聞不必說是十四家以外之銀行、暗中活動、只要雙方頭寸鬬攏、就可由銀行向紐約劃賬、因爲行市比黑滙之四元七五、還可少賣一二五、旣然價錢更比黑匯貴、試問有如此好生意、誰肯將出口外匯結與十四家銀行、做銀行生意賺的佣金、比〇三一二五爲優厚、豈有不半推半就之理、故硬說黑匯消滅、無非是欺人之談、烟幕作用、新聞有不少是業中人「自我宣傳」、論文難道沒有「御用作品」、即使是「非華商」、亦可照樣買賣黑匯、絕不然、可用美鈔代替、據傳上海流通之美鈔、上下於五千萬乃至三千萬美金之間、一部分爲一般有資力者所守藏、一部分現正流通於市塲、此美鈔以需要旺而上漲、前日英鈔之上升、無失欲將不便行用之英鈔亦會上漲之宜傳、掩飾美鈔上漲之非爲代替美匯之故、亦有以爲美鈔可替代美滙、難道英鈔不可替代英匯、但不要忘記英政府對於英鈔之一番處置、究不能如目前美鈔一樣自由自在、不知美政府果有凍結之決心、對美鈔難道仟其放浪於形骸之外、特爲網開一面、不爲處置、至上海華商投機家之百萬美元以上之多空、仍在擯持中、迄晚收、約英匯二辦士八一二五、美金四元六八七五、比上週六英平、美又緊〇六二五、廿一日香港匯價等均無變動、天津開盤告平、倫敦電匯緊〇六二五、爲三便士、紐約雷匯不動、仍站五元、申匯降一元、爲八十五元五角、「聯鈔」晤盤昂二元一角二分、爲四十七元五角、</p>
<h3>現金不挫　退至九千元關口</h3>
<p>昨日烚亦暗市、期貨起落隘狹、當日僅十元高低、盤於上週六收價六千八百九十五元左右、終較小二元、了結交易五百餘兩、現金轉向下挫、退至九千元關邊、香港方面某種空氣傳來、人心帶軟、晨開德孚首出時和十兩、爲九千〇八十元、計做低十元、成記時和兩金號進、升至九千〇九十元、忽見祥和·德大·德成售出、利空傳說亦起、退至九千元關口、中興·祥興永買進、提上至午刻九千〇廿元、下午初即做低十元、金號出銀號五十兩、爲九千〇十元、明豐出七十兩、成記出六十兩、均祥興永買進、價九千元、終見銀號互做廿兩、三點半收價九千〇〇五元、比上週六午刻小八十五元、有九十元高低、做開約六百兩、金號本牌金、門市九千〇五十元、收進减二百元、飾金亦小十元、爲九百廿元、</p>
<p>期貨起落愈狹</p>
<p>十月期金每條（十兩）、天元首進聚豐永廿兩、價已開高五元、爲六千九百元、一利·晋元吐售、回下至六千八百九十元、俄見祥興永·德成補空、提上至六千八百九十五元、天元·立泰售出、遜至六千八百九十二元、午收六千八百九十四元、下午二點開市六千八百九十二元、即低二元、天元少進、市况平、後直至三點半收市、六千八百九十三元、比上週六收市續軋小二元、有十元高低、</p>
<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行三點半掛小十元、爲九百廿元、收進减五十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣升降互有</h3>
<p>咋日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨現金價谷跌五元、英金票回落一元、美金票趨勢堅穩、晚市仍站一十二元五角、香港票亦無變動、日金票回小一分、晚市退爲二元三角五分、朝鮮票則續高一分、晚市升爲二元零六分、</p>
<h3>證劵　債市人心懈怠　股票下瀉亦速</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市盤旋不已、雖曾一度將丙種抬高至二元、終仍壓小、幸多方大戶、尙無售出之意、是以欲看大小面、殊非易事、昨日交易、亦見淸减、上午久豐·怡泰·天生買進、協興元·九成·樂茂均賣出、丙種曾見一元六角半小價、午後中孚銀行及裕興號兩家專事賣出甲乙種、大華·聯和則普遍供出、聚鑫·怡泰·公茂買進丙種、一度興奮見二元行市、終仍爲一元七角收盤、人心懈怠、暫行殊難樂觀、結果除甲種未有高低外、餘則微小一角至三角、成交不過一百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華成烟公司股五十股、價為六十八元正、</p>
<p>又上海衆業公所股市、成交極鉅、價格動盪不定、晨開即現低價、開後愈形向上、多方渠低來進、午收略又回高、下午開盤、直綫下瀉以迄收市、橡皮股成交較實業股爲少、故上落亦不甚大、</p>
<p>揚子銀公司股與新股股權、茲已分開計算、故咋日所標價乃爲除權後之新價、</p>
<h3>糧食　米價雖跌　米質愈雜　舉發只有其名　門售更乏準則</h3>
<p>大量洋米昨有到滬、太古公司成都輪、於上星期六下午抵埠、由暹邏直接運來洋米三千七百五十五包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、昨日又有泰生利公司經理之泰輪Suriyathai　Nawa　號、昨晨到埠、由暹邏運來洋米三千七百噸、計三萬八千餘包、停靠浦東隆茂棧碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>昨洋米初平繼漲、終又回定、而行情則比之上週末已續加二三元、早晨開市時因到存兩多、進出相敵、市面未有上落、繼因本客週初添辦外又有業內外大戶趁平吸收、而投機操縱之徒、又借工部局公賣小絞久未抑價續批、與定貨多日未有整正成議、藉此造謠抬撑、雖目下時局一無刺激性之發展、而洋米市價終被一班皮球所踢高、小絞現貨又盤到一百零九元、路貨英華司到一百三十七元、現英華司一百二十六元半、一百二十八元、一百三十一元、比之週六均已加起二三元、惟價高後買氣漸淡、故午後已見平定、全日成交達三萬包以上、英華司亦到一千噸有奇、米商在此兩年中無一不貧兒暴富、非但從米價上賺得倍稱之利、又從米質上米量上搜刮不遺餘力、現在之米、只有其名而實不副、價只管照名義上定、實際上則儘多攙雜混售、自從各色小絞米價跌至工部局米以下、工部局米價近　屹然不動、有仍掛一百十七元、有掛一百零七元、零八元，甚至有見零四元、亦有將工部局米紙牌撤除、而所售出之米、惡形惡劣、工部局雖獎勵人舉發、但不知工部局米是怎樣、纔是名實相符、而且要舉發米、最好要有公務人員充見證、已是一時所呼應小靈、再則米店中所售不上一種、儘可圖賴、反受其累、所以舉發一事、理論上可行、事實不會有此舉、此無怪米商敢於作姦爲惡、害及大衆也、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、巳呈跌風、為來源積夥、銷塲為連日升漲、頓感價高棘手、轉移目光於洋米、市面遂難立足、新破兩粳價均見下游、南港早破尤較貶透、計達三四元之巨、開百五十元、次至百四十七元半、浦東新粳則降一二元、開百五十二元半、百五十一元半、至於厚破仍以乏貨無市、</p>
<p>糯米素唯洋米馬首是瞻、茲際佳檔、零胃既暢、更有大戶吸收、遂追附驥尾並騰四五元、計開香港特白元達百三十四五元、中至百三十元、次貨亦須百二十八元、糯茶開百十六元半、次至百十四元半、</p>
<h3>洋粉宜可安定　惟塲外仍多活動</h3>
<p>洋粉存底常在百數十萬包、而消化則以零星爲主、整批轉口亦復見少、故市面似可暫時安定、現在目前一無刺激性之時局下、投機操縱殊無假端踢高之可能、第昨因週一有實銷添辦外、又有業外大戶趁平檔吸收、開市即見買氣旺暢、喊聲甚高、惟市塲中因遭禁阻、淮戶未能儘興收買、而皮球份子隨時活動於塲外黑市之黑市、金龍西棧即自三十元〇九角漲達三十一元四角、東棧三十一元六角到三十二元、砲台三十二元七角至三十三元一角、均較上週末漲五六角、麩皮進出兩乏、小麥亦乏正市、然以米粉兩市上漲、市形統見挺秀、</p>
<p>到滬洋粉、則有華綸洋行經理之美輪DagrnaRSalen號、於前日（星期日）由加拿大到埠、運來麫粉三百零六噸、約一萬五千包、</p>
<h3>紗花　多空壁壘森嚴　紗市轉成僵局</h3>
<p>紗市氣勢平淡、益呈欲漲乏力　欲跌不能　變成僵持之局面也、大戶多頭吸　頗巨、所以檯面殊感枯弱、但拋空者謂國際情况尙在幻變莫測中、加以取引所紗市極疲萎、意態仍抱逢高必賣主義、於是雙方之壁壘異常堅固也、至於現紗銷路、依然勿見興盛氣象、港幫採辦殊感缺乏、二十支雙馬高價爲一千七白五十四元、低價爲一千七百四十三元、午後開盤價爲一千七百四十二元、漲至一千七百四十七元、旋後謠諑傳來、跌至一千七百三十七元、收盤又見回昂一步、至一千七百四十二元、目前紗市買方謂鈔票充斥、賣方因底盤已入高境、非跌不進、因之角逐尤烈、將後之變遷程度、不知如何耶、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後謠說紛紛、莫裏一時、在未開盤之前、價格做低、形勢紊亂、首盤價稍有出入、掛牌價爲一千七百五十元、人心尙安定、少頃跌至一千七百四十三元、嗣後取引所開市狀况帶遜、人氣安靜、空頭扒補、大戶拖進、絡續升至一千七百五十四元、但聞客幫銷塲久旺、市態又復回鬆至一千七百四十五元、然收盤情形尙佳、爲一千七百四十八元、查半日間成交統計八千九百二十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　二五　同行　八·九〇〇</p>
<p>統計　八·九二五</p>
<p>金變馬期貨市况、微波盪漾、仲縮狹小、各幫觀望不前、檯面交易稀少、當晨間開出、以洋花繼續慘跌、消息又多沉寂、人心惶惶、頗覺不耐、是以浮多首先賣出、廠單走勢軋軟、期紗開出隨之無力、九月期已停止交易、十二月期開始登塲、散多紛紛脫手、新空跟踪拋售、塲中交易稀少、完全爲賣方所制、故十月期開盤爲一六六四元、即軋低七元、十一月期爲一六七八元、亦降七元、十二月份初做爲一七〇〇元、入後因取引所一度下游、乃又再跌、旋經零星散戶之買進、遂又逐步回高、第無顯著進出、故上落頗稱平庸、午後塲中買意稍濃、脚地略爲站定、迨收盤時各回高三四元許、結果近期爲一六六四元五角收市、下跌六元五角、十一月爲一六七六元、亦小九元、十二月爲一七〇四元五角、較與開盤微升四元五角、茲列成交價格表於後、</p>
<h3>美政府貸棉售價　約賤五六百磅音　本埠廠商羣起訂購</h3>
<p>滬望外棉交易、良以大批美國政府貸棉售價頗爲便宜、各中外紗廠購意均屬踴躍、此項消息之傳來、始於上週、經多方棉業洋行之探討、乃於上星期六及今日不斷以嶄新姿態、活躍而競爭於各廠方及同業之間、售價之廉、校之美國現貨市塲低落約五六百磅音之大、故無疑當爲各廠方抵補原棉之良好機會也、但以各種手續仍有少許麻煩、成功與否、不能預卜、因之少數同業依然觀望中也、</p>
<p>現棉情况、人心一致望高、無奈環境所不許、二則近來美棉步向下風、比頂峯時已落百餘磅音、加之紗市平庸、三二支及四一支紗綫趨勢向下游、於是棉市影響不少也、昨粗細原棉調動尙稱活躍、良以實需不凡、廠胃尙健故也、</p>

<h3>疋頭　怡和期貨粗布　較現市昂一元</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨　堅穩、緣實銷繼續良好、售盤因廠方開價高昂、怡和廠期貨粗布照現市昂一元左右、昨開出一千餘件、現布市價被形響上漲、粗布每疋漲二角半至五角、細布斜紋一部份漲二角半、金三塔等牌漂布漲五角、色布平平、本街成交五百餘件、粤港南洋幫辦粗細布漂布斜紋等四百餘件、浙東定海幫辦粗布斜紋五六十件</p>
<p>東布　取引所期布隨紗下降、每疋跌四角至五角、而現貨市塲之細布細斜、則以本街染廠實銷仍旺、晨盤稍疲、後市回緊、與上週末無甚軒輊、但四君子嗶嘰因囤戶吐售、每碼跌一分半之譜、晚收時新單新稅爲二元二角二分、新單老稅二元一角五分、</p>
<h3>油市　來源湧旺　食油猛落　新黃豆大批將到</h3>
<p>食油實銷仍鮮開展、而各地來貨已絡繹運申、致貨主均不敢再事堅持、求脫頗殷、本廠豆油昨已跌入二百元關內、爲一百九十元、比前猛落達十餘元、其餘亦悉見趨疲、惟期貨因米業多戶尙在負創掙扎、故市勢欲跌、輒被扳止、結果與前無大榮辱、統市售開靑島生油一百餘桶、大有廠豆油一百担、又菜油二百担、又淸油期貨四千多担、立德廠菜油二百担、泰山廠菜油五十桶、日華聯菜油期貨三千桶左右、（價詳市價欄）昨有豆油二百八十件牛油二百件自天津來、</p>
<p>黄豆各地新貨已源源而來、聞有大批正在途中、致人心頗爲萎軟、昨由本街辦去歸德黄豆三百包、膠州黄豆一百餘包、常州及呂城牛皮豆三百多包、價比前悉挫半元至元許、昨有豆子一千包自津來、</p>

<h3>英美應以最大決心　維護租界現狀　行政主權必須完整獨立　務以堅强姿熊互相合作</h3>

<h3>售票員推斃乘客案　捕房請處最高刑　被吿行為險惡罪無可逭　審結定期宣判僞證扣押</h3>
<p>本月十三日下午一時半、有前在鹽務局辦事之溫州人項東川（年四十二歲家住西摩路慈厚里二十三號）、因乘坐英商廿路B字三五二號無軌電車、在同孚路威海衛路口下車時、以該車三五八號賣票海門人王萬祥揩油、未將所付車資兩角之車票給付、向索未遂、王萬祥老羞成怒、竟將項東川推下、致跌傷腦部、迨車送醫院、不久身死、肇禍之賣票員王萬祥、由華副探長廖貴龢·探員呂壽昌·帶入成都路捕房、解送第一特院、由同車乘客聖約翰中學學生蔣靖、到庭證明被吿因揩油不遂、則手將死者推下、庭論改期調查在案、</p>
<p>社會公憤</p>
<p>但自此項新聞經本報披露後、社會人上激於義憤、對於賣票之公然揩油、及項之死於非命、咸抱不平、與論譁然、昨晨此案已屆續訊之期、捕房傳同各證、將王解送特一院刑二庭、由石推事升座訊理、被吿由電車公司常年法律顧問李庚祥律師到庭辯護、而死者家屬、亦延蔣保釐·姜屏藩·律師出庭、附帶民訴、首由捕房律師張天蔭依照刑法二七一條第一項殺人罪起訴、謂現據檢察處及法醫之騐屍報吿、證明死者委係生前被推跌傷後腦而死、</p>
<p>到案證人</p>
<p>昨日另有證人許申金·嚴德發二人到庭、查許申金當時曾與死者同時跌下受傷者、至嚴德發、則係攻擊上次到庭作證蔣靖之證言爲不可靠者、由電車公司西人密爾、伴赴捕房、據嚴在捕房稱、彼與蔣靖同屋而居、事後蔣作證回家、曾對弄口之皮匠周某言及、當時實係蔣自己拉鈴、電車遂同前開行、死者因此跌下受傷身死、彼因見報載有賣票推斃人命之事、深覺賣票寃枉、乃出而作證、捕房現請庭上對於證人嚴德發特別注意、因嚴恐係受人指使、包庇被吿到庭充作僞證云云、</p>
<p>猶圖狡辯</p>
<p>詰之被吿王萬祥供、死者到達　孚路車站時、欲下車、我向其賣票、死者着我先給車票後付車資、我以公司章程無此規定、當加拒絕、其時死者拉鈴車遂開行、死者因欲逃票跳下、致跌傷身死、我並未動手推跌等詞、繼據證人許申金投案證稱、在南京中學讀書、是日下午一時半、我由同孚路威海衛路口登廿路無軌電車、甫上踏板時、死者站　我旁、證人蔣靖則坐於門首、嗣死者以所付車資二角、未得車票、乃向被告索討、被吿不理、且打鈴兩下、車乃開行、鐵門未閉、死者欲拉鈴停車、被吿則手推於死者前胸、死者因一時無物可拉、即拉住我左臂、致我同時跌下、受震暈迷云云、</p>
<p>恐嚇證人</p>
<p>又據證人蔣靖供明一切、其詞與上次相同、但據蔣稱、自此案發生後、曾有許多人到我家、因我不在、乃向我母親恐嚇、堅欲我改變口供、我因環境不佳、故不敢在家住宿、謹向庭上聲明云云、石推事以蔣靑年學子、見義勇爲、且請假到庭作證、殊堪嘉許、當諭設有此種情形發生、可向捕房報吿、又據證人嚴德發供、南翔人、向業賣粢飯、與蔣靖同居大沽路福來里三號、自上次本案開庭後、蔣回家、無意中向我提及、謂彼在庭上所供、均非事實、</p>
<p>竟作僞證</p>
<p>當時實係蔣拉鈴開車、致死者跌上身死且我於十六日見報上載有此項新聞、乃知被告實係寃枉、遂向弄口之皮匠周志九談及、不料爲二四一號賣票所聞、報吿　車公司、邀我到庭作證等詞、該證人對於蔣靖大肆攻擊、嗣庭上以嚴之口供單擲下、着嚴朗讀、則期期艾艾、讀不成句、而蔣靖即向庭上聲明、嚴頃問所稱各節皆非事實、我決無對生身母親說謊話、　對一無痛癢相關者反說實話之理、查嚴一向來行爲不端、我母親因屢着一令遷移、懷恨於心、實係到庭作僞證等語、</p>
<p>依法嚴辦</p>
<p>庭上以事實　瞭、論令開始辯論、捕房律師張天蔭以按照各證供言、對於刑法二七一條第一項之殺人罪、因不能證明被吿有故意殺人之行爲、殊屬不能適用、　請依據刑法二七七條第二款傷害致死罪判罪、查被吿行爲險惡、手段毒辣、於法毫無可恕之處、且自此案發生後、已引起社會之公憤、輿論譁然、皆不値被吿之所爲、若不依法嚴辦、殊可影響全滬乘客之生命之安全、</p>
<p>僞證收押</p>
<p>此案改期中、捕房深悉貴院接到在社會上頗有地位之信函多封、如某校校長襲哲儒以及蔡彩金等、其信中所稱各事情形、大致與蔣許兩證人之所供相符、現捕房　求庭上依照刑法二七七條二項之最高刑無期徒刑加以判決云云、末由被吿律師李庚祥及死者家屬、所延之姜屛藩律師辯論之下、庭論彼吿押候二十六日上午宣判、證人嚴　發有偽證嫌疑、着令收押、移送本院檢察處偵查、</p>

<h3>怎樣研究今日的中國地理</h3>
<p>— 譚廉</p>
<p>現在外國軍隊、已經侵入我國國境、國界一部分已經殘破、整個國界完整也談不到、然一國的國界、總不能長此含糊、待到軍事平後、必須首先整理、不經一番研究、臨時必漫無標準、喪失主　、我國西南國界、如雲南的中緬南段木定界、已於民國二十四二十五二十六三年中、雙方派員重勘、大部分已經勘定、據說這次勘界、班洪猛梭允許歸我、報吿書已草成、只要等雙方政府公布、因盧溝橋戰事爆發中止、最近建築滇緬鐵路、因中緬接軌、須劃定、未定界才開上、或有乘此解決懸案希望、（現雙方已正式公布）、中緬北段未定界、因片馬江心坡久經爭執、還沒有解決、英已從密支那分築公路到片馬及工布拉蚌侵犯我國的主權、西部的帕米爾、素稱中英俄三國共有、界綫迄未劃定、實際上大部分已被侵占、南部最南國界、爲團沙羣島的曾姆灘、筆者一再在報端發表論文、並印行專圖、呼籲國國人注意、數年來各出版地圖並未更正、閱圖者亦未有意見發表、足見國人對於國界、不甚重視、這是一個極嚴重問題、應常硏究的、</p>
<p>陸路的鐵路公路、水路的航路、都是幫助戰時運輸的、公路除最重要的滇緬路、中外共同注目外、還有廣西岳圩到車河的一條公路、築成後本擬南通越南、做國際間問道的、惜因越南事變、和滇越鐵路同受阻礙、其他新築成的路、有西昌判樂山、大河壩到玉樹、路綫較長、玉樹向南本有通西康的預定綫、覆測後覺地形太陡、行車不易、須另覓較安全的路綫、方能興工、報載四康通緬甸公路、最近已通車、因未載明起迄點、不明眞相、還有西昌到祥雲的公路、</p>

<h3>做學生食堂的食堂</h3>
<p>— 郭洪迪</p>
<p>到四川路靑年會的學生食堂裏去嘗了一次經濟飯菜的滋味以後，再看了看當日的菜單和葷業菜成份表，我開始感覺到在我們的日常生活中，有許多地方是可以改變得更合理化，更科學化的。</p>
<p>道個男女靑年會所合辦的學生食堂，在他們所標榜的合乎「經濟，衛生，營養」三原則上，可說是做到了的。在一天的菜單中，有猪肝炒洋山芋，猪肉炒海帶黄花菜，紅燒黄魚豆腐，牛肉絲炒洋葱，炒靑菜，番茄蔬菜湯這六種花樣，菜都是經過專家的批准，富於營養而相當可口的。食堂裏的佈置，雖談不上富麗堂皇，整潔二字却是可以當之無愧的。在這樣的地方吃一頓這樣富於營養的飯菜，祇花一元四角（學生祗一元二角，淸寒學生祇消七角就有了），請問在今日的上海要到那裏去找？食堂中自動拿碗裝飯的辦法也是値得提倡的。</p>
<p>我不是要替這學生食堂做廣吿，但是在吃了一頓飯以後，我覺得各學校也是可以仿效他們的比較科學化的辦法的。此外，附近各校的學生，或是非學生的公司商店的辦事人員，即使不一定要做長期食客，也不妨去試一試這家常便飯式的飯菜。這個食堂雖名曰舉生，但是食客却是不限於學生的。</p>
<p>做父母的人，請帶你的子女去一次，使他們知道自己的手也可以端菜裝飯；如果方便的話，請傭人去吃一頓也好，讓她們知道廚房飯廳是不一定要塵灰滿桌，蒼蠅密佈的。</p>

<h3>家醜論</h3>
<p>— 雷震</p>
<p>這似乎由來已久了，「家醜」是不允許外揚的。所遺憾者，此種所謂「家醜」總是愈欲隱瞞而流傳愈廣，最後仍免不了出乖丢醜。在這裏，另外一句成語，倒好像很合用，就是：「若要人不知，除非已莫爲」</p>
<p>然而「莫爲」是悖乎主張「家醜不可外揚」者底初旨的。他們的哲學：我做了歹事，你不許替我宣佈出來；批評反對，那更是罪該萬死了。</p>
<p>於是，一方面儘量製造，一方面禁止宣揚「家醜」乃愈來愈多，愈弄愈糟。然而，活生生的事實，擺在面前，雖有偷天妙手，但隻手亦決掩不盡犬下人的耳目；結果，徒見其心勞日拙，枉費心機而已。這在歷史上並不乏先例。</p>
<p>如今，關於「家醜」的問題叉甚　座上，其間顯然有兩種不同的見解。因爲問題的　結在於國內少數別有企圖者的陰謀磨擦，壓迫陷害，貪汚囤積，荒淫縱樂等等，所以這種醜也就關涉到全中國的人民。</p>
<p>主張家醜不可外揚的一方，諷爲家醜只能掩蓋，不可宣揚，免作他人宣傳的藉口，因此對於一切確屬醜惡的事實，雖已衆目昭彰，無可蒙瞞，亦必絕口否認，或曲事辯解，以求貫徹其「癩痢頭兒子自己好」的目的，另一方的主張，則認爲家人有了醜行，就該澈底根究，務把此種醜行淸洗掉；不要因爲怕別人有所藉口，而對他們縱容放任，反而便這些害羣之馬逍遙自在，優哉游哉，進而更胆大妄爲，無惡不作，使整個的「家」不得安寗，甚至進一步走向潰滅。</p>
<p>這兩種主張可說絕對相反的，而其出發點無疑的都是爲了維護自己的祖國。因爲問題本身關涉到我國全體人民，所以我們應該循着最正確的途徑去解決，而不使全國人民俱蒙其害。</p>
<p>現在，先決問題並不是家醜的外揚或不外揚，主要的倒是有無　滅家醜的決心。正如身上生了毒瘡，必須趕快割治，才能保全其餘好的部份；若因怕露出瘡疥給別人嘲笑或攻擊，而反諱疾忌醫，不加療治，這會得到怎樣的結果呢？恐怕待病入膏育時耍悔之晚矣，癩痢頭即使長年戴着帽子，終難免被人揭露時的難堪，唯一辦法，就是以殺蟲藥水消滅在頭皮上繁殖的微菌；以帽子來掩蓋之沒有用的。</p>
<p>同樣的理由，對少數特權階級的罪行隱瞞掩護，只有助長其毒燄，加重最大多數人民的痛苦；而且影響所及，不僅僅是大家的顏面問題，而係整個國家的存亡了。</p>
<p>姑息足以養奸，養癰終必貽患，眞正愛護自己的「家」的朋友們，還是讓我們集中力量，揭發與撲滅一切隱藏在屋角裏的醜惡渣滓吧！</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Counterattack on the South Bank of the Gu River, Recovering Guiyi and Encircling Xinshi. Japanese Troops, Threatened on Both Sides, Halt Their Advance. Chinese Troops Launch Multi-pronged Offensive Against Yuezhou, a Japanese Base.</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Yesterday, Chinese troops launched a counterattack against Japanese forces on the south bank of the Gu River, recovering Guiyi and encircling Japanese troops in areas such as Luokou and Xinshi. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties along the Gu River. Simultaneously, strong units of the Chinese army, deployed on the south bank of the Xinqiang River, launched a fierce assault on the flank and rear of the Japanese army as planned, recapturing positions around Guanwang Bridge and Dajing Street. They are now mopping up towards Changle Street. The Japanese are resisting desperately, and fierce fighting continues. The Japanese forces that infiltrated the south bank of the Gu River, fearing being cut off by the Chinese army, are in a dilemma. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha - A portion of the Japanese forces that infiltrated the south bank of the Miluo River were routed after being ambushed by Chinese troops on the 20th, and the Chinese army is in hot pursuit. Furthermore, a major fire broke out in the Changle Street area on the afternoon of the 21st, and the Japanese troops entrenched there showed signs of wavering and began to collapse. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha - On the morning of the 21st, a certain Chinese army corps, using a secret maneuver, entered the southeastern periphery of Yuezhou and launched a joint fierce attack on Yuezhou. Progress is currently proceeding smoothly. Simultaneously, Chinese commando units operating behind Japanese lines in northern Hunan are very active, cutting the northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway into several segments. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha - The battle between Chinese and Japanese forces for the line along the Gu and Wei Rivers in northern Hunan has continued for three days. Since the Japanese forcefully crossed the Xinqiang River and invaded, infiltrating areas near Guiyi and Xinshi Changle Street Wukou along the Miluo River, they have been subjected to continuous interception by Chinese forces, suffering heavy casualties. On the afternoon of the 21st, the Japanese, unable to withstand the Chinese army's fierce attacks in the rain, and those who had infiltrated the banks of the Miluo River began to collapse. The Chinese are in hot pursuit. As for the Japanese who invaded Qingshan by water, they have repeatedly attempted to land at Yingtian but have been repelled by the Chinese troops. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changde - On the morning of the 19th, Chinese mopping-up troops launched a fierce attack on the Japanese forces who had retreated to areas west of Luxi Bay on the opposite bank of Yueyang. The Japanese were unable to hold and retreated towards Luxi Bay. The Chinese are intensifying their mopping-up operations and will soon completely clear the area. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman stated this afternoon that the Japanese army has mobilized a total of five divisions, or 80,000 troops, 20 warships, 200 motorboats, and 100 aircraft in the current Hunan campaign. There are currently 10,000 Japanese troops on the south bank of the Miluo River, about 80 kilometers north of Changsha, and 30,000 on the north bank, with another 40,000 in reserve. The Chinese army's current strategy is to first lure the Japanese troops to concentrate on their battle lines, and then isolate their offensive. Therefore, the Chinese army only offered slight resistance in the initial stages of the war, but after the Japanese army crossed the Miluo River on September 20, it launched a sudden attack. At the same time, a powerful column on the north bank moved westward, attacking the flanks of the Japanese army in three directions. The Chinese army's flank attacks have temporarily halted the Japanese advance southward and forced them to divide their forces to deal with the threat to their rear. The Japanese army has suffered 15,000 casualties in five days of fighting. As the war is currently in progress, the spokesman declined to predict the outcome. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to the latest news from the front lines of Hunan Province received here, the Chinese army's fierce flank offensive may have checked the Japanese advance on Changsha. Reuters has learned from well-informed sources that the highest unified command of the Chinese army had made meticulous plans over the past two years to deal with a possible Japanese advance on Changsha. When the vanguard of the Japanese army, the Third Division, crossed the Xinqiang River on September 18, the Chinese division defending the south bank retreated to designated positions without actually incurring any losses. However, after the Japanese army crossed the Miluo River, the Chinese army firmly defended the line along the south bank of the river without retreating. Therefore, although the Japanese army had established several bridgeheads on the river, it was ultimately unable to make any progress. At the same time, powerful Chinese armies moved in several directions towards Yuezhou, attacking the Japanese base. Other Chinese units struck between the Xinqiang and Miluo Rivers, threatening the Japanese flanks. It is reported that the Japanese army crossed the Miluo River at four locations: Wukou, Wulin City, Xinshi, and Guiyi. According to yesterday's war reports, the Chinese army's powerful counterattack has halted the Japanese advance, and the Japanese troops in the Guiyi area have indeed retreated to the opposite bank. According to intelligence received by the Chinese military authorities, the purpose of the Japanese offensive this time is not only to seize Changsha but also to occupy Hengyang. News from Changsha states that Xue Yue, Chairman of Hunan Province and Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese forces in the region, is extremely calm and confident. All government agencies in the area are operating as usual. If the Japanese army's purpose is to seize stored rice, they will be greatly disappointed, as of the seven million piculs of rice in the Dongting Lake area, two million piculs were shipped to Fujian when Liu Jianxu took office as Chairman of Fujian, three million piculs have been shipped elsewhere, and only two hundred piculs are scattered in various villages. It is also rumored that 30 Japanese heavy bombers recently arrived in Hankou to reinforce the Japanese air force there. It is unknown whether these aircraft will be used in the Hunan campaign or continue to raid Chongqing. Chongqing's fog season has started particularly early this year, and dense fog was seen this morning. It is said that Chongqing's winter fog is the most effective weapon against Japanese bombing. (22nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to the Military Affairs Commission, the Chinese army's counterattack on the left flank of the Japanese army advancing south toward Changsha yesterday was very successful. Observers have so far been unable to understand whether the purpose of the Japanese offensive this time is to attempt to seize new rice in the fertile Xiang River or Dongting Lake area, or to attempt to occupy the capital of Hunan Province, as in 1939. Officials stated that the Chinese reserves north of the Miluo River (the Chinese army's natural second line of defense) fought fiercely with the Japanese at dawn yesterday. The Chinese army then attacked Yanglin Street and Guanwang Temple. More than 10,000 Japanese troops were completely routed at Guanwang Temple, and the Chinese army contained the Japanese offensive in the Yanglin Street and Changle Street areas. The official Chinese report stated that the Japanese army crossed the Miluo River at four points. The central Japanese force, totaling 3,000 troops, crossed Changle Street and advanced rapidly on Wusong City. Another column of 1,000 troops attacked from the upper reaches of Wugou. Another 2,000 Japanese troops attacked from Xinshi, and another 1,000 attacked from Guiyi. It is said that the Japanese center suffered heavy casualties, but the war is still continuing. The left flank has adopted a defensive posture after suffering more than 400 deaths. The Japanese troops in Xinshi are fighting stubbornly, attempting to gain a foothold on the south bank. The Japanese troops in Guiyi were driven back to the north bank of the river. The Japanese army has also failed to land in Dongting Lake using motorboats in the past three days. The Japanese lost ten motorboats and twenty other vessels, and five hundred men were killed at Yingtian. The Japanese attack on Sulin Pool was also defeated. (22nd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Capture Anyang Station</p>
<p>Luoyang - On the 15th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Anyang Station and the airfield, and in fierce fighting until the morning of the 16th, killed and wounded many Japanese soldiers, destroyed several miles of railway tracks, and seized more than 200 catties of electric wire. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji - A unit of the Japanese army from Lehe intruded into the Fengzhang Village area on the morning of the 18th and was severely attacked by Chinese troops, leaving behind many corpses before fleeing back. A unit of the Japanese army from Liulin (west of Lishi) harassed Chenjiayan on the morning of the 19th and was intercepted by Chinese troops. After a long period of fierce fighting, the Japanese were unable to hold and fled in panic. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang - On the morning of the 14th, the Japanese army was hastily building fortifications in Renjiazhuang, southwest of Ruicheng, when a certain unit of the Chinese army seized the opportunity to attack and inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese, completely destroying the Japanese fortifications. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces Defeated in Their Invasions</p>
<p>In a certain area of eastern Zhejiang, the Japanese army invaded Huawang Village, south of Yuyao Nan Nanmiao City, and was severely attacked on the 18th, retreating in complete defeat. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>In a certain area of southern Anhui, a unit of the Japanese army from Yinjiahui launched a harassing attack on the areas of Huaqingshan, Pingdingshan, and Dalangshan, south of the Yinjiahui region, at dawn on the 17th. After being met by Chinese forces, the Japanese were unable to hold and fled in a panic. (2) On the morning of the 17th, the Japanese from Huxingshan, southeast of Yinjiahui, invaded Huaguapao Mountain. After two hours of fierce fighting, they were repelled by the Chinese forces. The Chinese forces pursued and inflicted considerable casualties. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Landing in Guanghai Obstructed</p>
<p>This morning, more than a thousand Japanese troops landed at Sanxiakou, Guanghai, and the Chinese garrison is resisting them. Simultaneously, several thousand Japanese soldiers from the Jiangmen and Xinhui areas, carrying dozens of motorboats, invaded the Daze area and are also being resisted by the Chinese forces. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing - The Japanese army advancing along the Taishan-Guanghai Highway is engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the Doushan Chong area and is currently deadlocked near Datangwei, east of Chongbei. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing - The Japanese army that fled west along the Xinkai Road was severely attacked by Chinese forces in Daze on the evening of the 20th, and its offensive was thwarted. They launched another attack this morning with reinforcements and are currently engaged in fierce fighting on the line between Xinghua and Shangxia Jiaofeng. Another group harassed Hengyong, and the Chinese forces blocked them from both banks, preventing them from making any progress. Both sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting near Hengyong. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Shijie Refutes Peace Rumors</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie recently denied reports that Japan had contacted the Chinese government for peace talks. Wang pointed out that President Roosevelt stated in his report on the Lend-Lease Act last week that the United States would provide China with greater assistance to enhance China's fighting power. He said that such peace rumors must have been spread by some people who believe that China will be controlled by the influence of the United States and Japan. Wang also praised the bravery of the Soviet army, saying that the news from the Eastern Front has made the Chinese people admire the courage and strength of the Soviet army. He said that the loss of Kyiv is not as important as the fact that the Nazi blitzkrieg has been badly defeated in the Soviet Union, and that Soviet morale is as high as ever. The German propaganda, which initially claimed that the Soviet Union could be defeated in six or eight weeks, has been ridiculed by the Chinese. He welcomed the arrival of Sir Frederic Eggleston, Australia's first Minister to China, saying, "Mr. Eggleston's arrival is not only welcomed by the Chinese people, but also increases the general belief that the anti-aggression countries in the Pacific are gradually cooperating more closely." (22nd United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Public Funeral for Zhang Jiluan; Preparatory Committee Established</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Chongqing Joint Committee of the China Journalism Association and various newspapers held a joint meeting on the 22nd to discuss preparations for a public funeral for Mr. Zhang Jiluan. It was decided to establish a preparatory committee. In addition to the directors, supervisors, alternate directors, and supervisors of the association, as well as the presidents, managers, and editors-in-chief of the newspapers affiliated with the Joint Committee, representatives from the journalistic community in various regions and volunteers who wish to participate in initiating the public funeral for Mr. Zhang were also nominated to serve on the preparatory committee and participate in the preparations as a whole. The preparatory committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 25th to elect standing committee members, a director-general, deputy director-general, and heads of various groups, and actively begin preparations. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Joint Memorial Week Held Yesterday Morning</h3>

After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Committee Member Li Wenfan explained Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings (The Fundamentals of National Reconstruction), focusing on the industrial plan, entitled (The Path Taken by the Industrial Plan and the Problems It Solves). The ceremony then concluded. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Mail Plane Crashes in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - The China National Aviation Corporation's Hong Kong-Shaoguan mail plane arrived in Hong Kong from Shaoguan on the morning of the 21st. While landing, it was suddenly struck by the wind and lost control, causing it to crash at the airfield. The pilot, Kuan Chenwen, and the radio operator, Xu and a person named Ruowu Qian, a total of three people, were injured, but not seriously. The aircraft was completely destroyed. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Banks Freeze Legal Tender Deposits; Black Market for Foreign Exchange in Hong Kong and Shanghai Gradually Eliminated; Foreign Exchange Controls Further Tightened</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Since the United States and Britain froze Chinese funds abroad, the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai has been eliminated through the joint efforts of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee and foreign banks. However, if the buying and selling of legal tender in Hong Kong is allowed to remain free and unrestricted, the complete elimination of the black market for foreign exchange, as well as the concentration of remittances from overseas Chinese and the stabilization of exchange rates, will inevitably be affected. When the Foreign Exchange Control Committee met a few days ago, it authorized the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to handle this matter. The Exchange Equalization Fund has now reached an agreement with the Hong Kong government to freeze the legal tender deposits of various banks and has requested that the free buying and selling of legal tender in Hong Kong be prohibited. After the black markets for foreign exchange in Hong Kong and Shanghai are gradually eliminated, the future of foreign exchange control will undoubtedly become more strict. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - The Hong Kong government, in cooperation with the Chinese government, issued a decree to banks here today restricting the withdrawal of Chinese national currency from accounts in Hong Kong banks. According to the decree, withdrawals cannot be made in Chinese legal tender, nor can checks be issued to individual or commercial banks in Shanghai as payees. Withdrawals are limited to remittances to family members or checks issued to Hong Kong residents as payees. (22nd United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Currency and Wartime Economy</h3>
<p>Currency is inextricably linked to human life. All aspects of production and consumption, such as food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, depend on currency as a medium. Even the seven emotions and six desires of human life are reflected in the power of money. As life and society become more complex, the use of currency becomes more troublesome. The more missions it has and the heavier its responsibilities are, the more likely it is to become confused and lose its grip. This is far from the simplicity of currency's original purpose and the ease with which it could complete its tasks. The intended functions of currency have not been fully realized, and modern problems are emerging endlessly and have not been resolved. It is clear that the progress of currency systems has failed to keep pace with human evolution. This is the scope of today's central currency problem, both in peacetime and in wartime. Let us first examine the functions of currency, then investigate the crux of the problem, and then elaborate on its wartime conditions.</p>
<p>Originally, the starting point of currency was clear, and its functions were fixed. Because humans cannot be self-sufficient, the way of dividing labor and cooperating has long been established. Thus, people considered how to exchange goods and services and relied on currency as a medium of exchange. This is its first function. Subsequently, as the trading system gradually developed, the position of the trading medium became more important. It was considered that this medium, which everyone trusted, must have its own intrinsic value in order to maintain its circulation. Moreover, the value of this medium must be able to be maintained permanently, so that the receiver can exercise its function at any time and exchange it for other necessary goods. This intrinsic value of the currency itself is like a warehouse of wealth. This is its second function. However, the medium of exchange must maintain its trading level. If one unit of currency can exchange for one unit of food today, then the exchange rate must also be the same in the future in order to complete its function. In other words, the medium of exchange is not for unregulated transactions; on the contrary, currency must be a measure of value. This is its third function.</p>
<p>The above three points are the functions of currency in peacetime. However, judging from reality, the exchange of currency and goods has no fixed ratio that can be maintained, and the rise and fall of prices are reflected without any restrictions. All three functions have not been fully realized, which can be seen at a glance. The biggest flaw in the way later generations used currency is that they did not use it for production but thought that currency exchange for currency was the path to wealth. However, they did not know that the use of currency was originally to circulate goods. Without goods or production, there would be nothing to circulate, and currency would have no use. In other words, currency represents resources and has no room for independent existence. Today, many people misunderstand its function, thinking that it has an independent value and can easily exchange goods at any time. They do not know that the way of producing goods has long been blocked, goods are scarce and valuable, and currency is abundant and cheap. This is the central problem of currency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding currency in wartime, although there has been much progress in its use in European countries, there are still many who inherit old sayings and stick to established practices, so that the use of currency not only cannot adapt to the wartime environment but also hinders the urgent needs of the wartime economy. In this time of living under airplanes and cannons, the idea of using profitability as a criterion for undertaking a certain project is truly a great fallacy. If it is decided to abandon farming because it is not profitable, wouldn't that force the people to starve? All such contradictory arguments and facilities are due to the poisoning of traditional thinking. Today, British people are strongly advocating a thorough reform of the monetary system and the breaking of traditional theories.</p>
<p>According to the most progressive thinking of the British people, the function of currency in wartime is completely different from that in peacetime. The function in wartime is only two kinds, passive and active. The realization of the first function lies in preventing currency from hindering the solution of material problems. In other words, whenever one wants to produce or purchase a certain item, the monetary calculation should be ignored even if it causes a loss. The realization of the second function lies in the equal distribution of wartime losses, which we call "those who have money contribute money, and those who have strength contribute strength," but the distribution of various sacrifices must be equal, which is what the British people urgently need to solve today. In peacetime, work and profit are interdependent, so the idea of emphasizing profit is still understandable. But in wartime, work and profit cannot be discussed together, so the wartime economy must not take profit as a premise.</p>
<p>In summary, to put it in a nutshell, the reason why currency becomes a problem is due to a failure to understand what it represents in the background. Today, there are many people who advocate the abolition of the currency system. If it is not abolished, then its use must be controlled to increase production and seek happiness for mankind. This is what the world expects of currency.</p>
<h3>America Will Not Abandon China; US-Japan Negotiations Stalled; Toyo Newspaper Believes Diplomatic Efforts Not Hopeless; Japanese Privy Council Convenes Important Meeting</h3>
<p>Washington, 21st - The "New York Times" reported that the US-Japan talks were stalled because Secretary of State Hull was unwilling to give Japan a special status and because Tokyo had not yet indicated that it had changed its aggressive policies and abandoned its ambition to rule China. Sources said that the US government will not sacrifice China in order to seek a compromise with Japan. Until Wakasugi returns to the United States, the US-Japan talks are not likely to make further progress. The "New York Herald Tribune" published an editorial criticizing the policy of appeasement, saying that US public opinion hopes that the government will not consider any situation satisfactory unless it fully restores China's administrative integrity.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Reuters) - The Kobe-based English-language Japan Chronicle, which was purchased from British merchants a few months ago, published an article that was quite optimistic about the US-Japan talks in Washington, saying that there were signs that Britain and the United States understood Japan slightly better than before. Although we do not want to give ourselves or others the illusion of the seriousness of the disputes between Japan and its major rival in the Pacific, there are various factors that make us hope that even at this latest hour, a satisfactory compromise can be reached. The article also welcomed the visit of Cooper to the Far East and the appointment of Lyttelton as the political adviser to the British forces in the Middle East, saying that this action was sufficient to show that the British government was willing to make closer contact with the peaceful political possibilities in that part of the world, and did not want to completely entrust itself to soldiers engaged in military movements who were not concerned about political influence.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (United Press) - The Cabinet Information Bureau announced today that it had not received a report about the rumored that Prime Minister Konoe had submitted a new note to President Roosevelt.

<h3>Japanese Build Spy Network on the East Coast of the Pacific; Investigation Reveals Shocking Truth</h3>
<p>Washington, 22nd (Havas) - Chairman Dies of the Anti-American Activities Investigating Committee stated today, in response to a committee mentioning Japan's densest spy network in the United States, that the United States will conduct large-scale cleanup work on the Pacific coast. The authorities have historically adopted a moderate attitude towards this matter because they do not want to hinder the delicate diplomatic negotiations currently underway between Japan and the United States. The staff of the committee have been conducting investigations on the Pacific coast for many months and have already discovered some facts that, once published, would be shocking.</p>
<h3>National Scientists Gather in Lintao, Solar Eclipse Observation Successfully Completed, Total Eclipse Lasts Three Minutes, Sky Darkens and Temperature Drops, Simultaneously Venus and Jupiter Appear to the East and West, A Swirl of Silver-White Sunlight Emerges with Myriad Rays of Light</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Dispatch, Northwest Solar Eclipse Observation Team, composed of top scientists and precise instruments from across the country, gathered in Lintao to observe the eclipse at Dongshan. This location was where Yang Jiaoshan, a Ming Dynasty remonstrance official, lectured while in exile. Over 500 people from various circles in Lanzhou, including Kuo Ch'ing Hui and Wang Shu-fang, came to visit, making it a grand gathering on a famous mountain. Today, the partial phase of the solar eclipse here began at 9:30 AM, one second later than predicted. The sky was clear and cloudless, and the shadow of the moon could be seen invading the sun's sphere from the upper right of the western side. At 10:05 AM, one-third of the sun's sphere was eclipsed, the sunlight gradually dimmed, and the temperature dropped by one degree Celsius. At 10:50:30 AM, totality occurred. At this time, the entire sunlight was obscured by the moon, and only the beautiful rays of light radiating around the edge were visible, known as "the corona." The sky darkened, and the temperature dropped by three degrees Celsius. At the same time, two giant stars appeared in the due east and due west directions. The former was Venus, and the latter was Jupiter. At 10:53:38 AM, the light began to return, and a swirl of silver-white sunlight emerged, radiating myriad rays of light. The duration from totality to the return of light was exactly as predicted, totaling three minutes. At 12:19 PM, the entire phenomenon of the total solar eclipse came to an end. Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 21st Dispatch, Lintao Dispatch, The world-watched total solar eclipse was successfully completed here today thanks to the collaborative efforts of more than ten experts from the Northwest Observation Team. According to Team Leader Zhang Yuzhe, this observation work was divided into six aspects: (1) photography of the corona, (2) comparison of the brightness of the corona and the moon, (3) calculation of the timing of the solar eclipse, (4) research on the spectrum of the corona and chromosphere, (5) timed photography of the entire process of the solar eclipse from beginning to end, and (6) filming of the entire process of the solar eclipse. The reporter arrived in Lintao from Lanzhou and departed for Dongshan this morning to the observation site inside Fanshan Temple. The scientists were seen occupying their posts and testing the instruments. When the timekeeper reported that the time of the initial eclipse had arrived, everyone immediately focused on their work. Timed photography every ten minutes also began simultaneously. The Central Broadcasting Affairs Management Office also set up broadcasting equipment on site. The first section of the solar eclipse broadcast began at this time. Two cameramen who were filming a color movie invented a way to soar into the sky above Lintao to capture color footage of the solar eclipse. When totality began, the broadcast stopped, but the sound of cameras could be heard one after another. The entire site was busy, making full use of these three precious minutes. At 10:40 AM, the second section of the broadcast began. The reporter was invited to report on the news of the total solar eclipse observation in Lintao. It was not until the sunlight was fully restored that all the observers were relieved of their burdens. This observation was successfully completed due to the clear weather. The corona was elliptical in shape, and there was a large prominence on the southern side of the sun's surface, all of which had been captured on camera. The brightness and meteorological conditions of the corona and chromosphere have also been captured and measured, and color and ordinary movies, as well as complete diagrams of various phases of the solar eclipse, have been taken separately by aircraft and on the ground. As for the results of the observation, the reporter inquired with each expert, but they all maintained a purely silent and confidential attitude, stating that they would not be able to publish anything until after a long period of research. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch, Today, Reuters received a direct telegram from Zhang Yuzhe, Director of the Chinese Solar Eclipse Observation Team in Gansu Province, stating that the trip was a complete success and that rare direct photographs and the spectacle of the corona were obtained. Observed through an exposure device, its total brightness was equal to that of a full moon. (Reuters, 22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wuyishan Solar Eclipse, Observation Divided into Five Teams</p>
<p>Wuyishan Dispatch, The solar eclipse observation here is divided into five working teams. One of the teams is the Southeast Team assigned by the Chinese Solar Eclipse Observation Committee, divided into two groups. Group A is led by Chen Xinqi, Director of the Geomagnetic Observatory of the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica, and Group B is led by Professor Zou Yi-tao of the Department of Astronomy of Zhongshan University. Zou participated in the solar eclipse observation in Hokkaido, Japan in 1936 and is a well-known female scholar in our country. The second team is led by Du Jinglie of the Large-Scale Surveying Group of the Land Surveying Bureau. The third team is jointly formed by Xiamen University and the Fujian Provincial Research Institute and is led by Xie Yuming. The fourth team is led by Shi Yanhan, Director of the Fujian Provincial Meteorological Bureau. The fifth team is a certain high-altitude surveying team, each responsible for (observing the beginning and end times of the eclipse), (geomagnetic changes), (photographing the solar eclipse), (the angle of the solar shadow), (celestial bodies visible during the eclipse), (darkness of the north pole), (changes in temperature and climate), (changes in sky brightness and speed), (changes in the scenery of the sky), (changes in the high-altitude electron layer), and other items. In addition, special phenomena of animals during the eclipse are the responsibility of the Animal Husbandry Farm of the Construction Department. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing Recognizes Solar Eclipse as a Sign of Victory</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch, After a long period of rain and haze in the wartime capital, hundreds of thousands of citizens were able to observe the rare solar eclipse phenomenon on the morning of the 21st, which has not occurred in 399 years. Everyone was delighted. Although the wartime capital was outside the (totality period), it was still able to glimpse nine-tenths of the eclipse. During (maximum eclipse), a dim image appeared. Citizens either stood in open spaces, looking up at the sky with thin clouds, or used containers to hold water and observe the changing sky through the reflection of the water. Others listened to the Central Broadcasting Station's dynamic report on the solar eclipse observation and were deeply interested in the knowledge about the solar eclipse. In the wartime capital, the eclipse began at 9:36 AM (initial eclipse), reached its maximum at 11:00 AM, and began to return to normal at 1:00 PM. Elderly people generally said that the total solar eclipse was a sign that our war was approaching victory, just as the total solar eclipse in the 21st year of Jiajing in the Ming Dynasty was a sign that the famous general Qi Jiguang would conquer and annihilate [unclear] and establish meritorious service.

<h3>Soviet Union Admits Fall of Kiev, German Forces Continue to Advance East, Aiming for Rostov, Red Army Rearguard Fighting Bravely</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 22nd Dispatch, The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report stating: "On the 21st, our army engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy along the entire line. After several days of intense fighting, our army has withdrawn from Kiev. On the 19th, our air force destroyed 60 German aircraft and lost 24 aircraft ourselves. The Finnish battleship 'Ilmarinen' sank after hitting a mine in the Gulf of Finland."</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 22nd Dispatch, Before withdrawing from Kiev, Soviet forces completely destroyed the city and the food and other important supplies of its neighboring civilians. Water and electricity projects were also destroyed. German engineers are now busy repairing bridges and roads and clearing obstacles.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd Dispatch, After Moscow formally announced the fall of Kiev and the German side described the city as a desolate wasteland, attention here has focused on the bloody fighting east of Kiev. It is reported that the Soviet regular army, supplemented by defense units, is now putting up a brave rearguard fight to stop the German forces.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 22nd Dispatch, British authorities recently revealed that fierce fighting is still taking place east of Kiev, and said that the German offensive reported to have reached the Sea of Azov seems to be aimed at capturing Rostov to control the mouth of the Don River.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd Dispatch, A German communique stated that German troops attacking from the west into Kiev had crossed the Dnieper River and advanced eastward, making contact with German troops attacking from the north across the Desna River. Soviet forces attempted to break through the German positions here but failed. The number of captured Soviet soldiers and war trophies has increased sharply.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 22nd Dispatch, German forces yesterday penetrated deep into southeastern Ukraine, and the vanguard has reached the coast of the Sea of Azov, encircling Crimea. According to a communique from the Fuehrer's headquarters, the mopping-up operations in the Kiev area are continuing. In the fighting east of Kiev, 150,000 Soviet soldiers were captured.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Adopts Scorched Earth Tactics, Kiev Presents a Scene of Utter Desolation</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd Dispatch, A newspaper in Bern, Switzerland, carried a wartime dispatch from a Milan newspaper stating that the Kiev garrison was exhausted to the extreme, so they abandoned the city. The city had been lacking drinking water for a week, and the food market had been largely empty a month ago and completely closed a week ago. Many Soviet wounded from the great battle in eastern Ukraine were transported to Kiev, causing the hospitals to be overcrowded. Schools, churches, theaters, hotels, and private houses were also filled with wounded soldiers, so Kiev became like one big hospital. However, the German army still had to break through the fortified zone of cement and steel, the mined areas, and the high-voltage wire defenses, engaging in terrible hand-to-hand combat before capturing the city. The German armored vanguard was repelled after reaching the city center and was only able to conquer it after three days of fierce fighting. The residents of the city and even the wounded soldiers had not received food or drink for 72 hours. Berlin announced last night that "the destruction and desolation found by the German army upon entering Kiev are indescribable." This completely contradicts the Axis reports that "Kiev was intact and undamaged when it was occupied, and the Soviet army did not implement scorched earth tactics in the city." A recent message from the German official news agency stated that all important supplies in Kiev had been transported away or destroyed, water and electricity plants had been destroyed, and railways and bridges had been blown up. Residents had no necessities of life. The Bolsheviks vented their anger by using destructive methods, endangering countless lives and being extremely cruel. A Vichy news agency telegram from Bern quoted a newspaper dispatch describing the German army's capture of Kiev. It was claimed that, according to "German officials," the German army had been outside Kiev for several weeks. When the German army first arrived, it immediately broke through the first line of artillery, but was then ordered to stop and take a defensive position, only repelling the counterattacks of the Soviet garrison. At the same time, the German forces led by General Bock and General Runstedt launched flanking actions, which were completed on Tuesday of last week, meeting 60 miles east of the city. The German army outside the city was then ordered to resume the offensive. Several divisions of the German army crossed the Dnieper River from the east bank to attack the north of the city, while other German troops advanced from the south along the west bank of the river, breaking through the Soviet defenses. This had a decisive impact on the capture of the city. On the night of September 18, German infantry swam across a small river south of Kiev. On the opposite bank of the river was a secret Soviet artillery position made of cement and steel. The German troops attacking these artillery positions took off their uniforms, wore only helmets, and carried weapons and ammunition. At that time, the German artillery was very active, and the German air force had previously destroyed the armories around the city, so the Soviet defense line was broken through. When the German army broke into the fortress at noon on Friday, the Soviet army surrendered, and the entire city fell into the hands of the German army.</p>
<p>Soviet Soldiers Hold Fast to Leningrad, Germans Land on Oesel Island</p>
<p>TASS, Battlefield Report, 22nd Dispatch, The defenders of Leningrad are displaying great courage and perseverance. The enemy has not been able to advance a single step in the past few days. Our fierce artillery fire has driven the enemy back into the trenches. At the same time, the Red Army is constantly counterattacking, preventing the enemy from breaking through our positions and forcing them to retreat. German aircraft have been heavily bombing our army's positions, but our army has steadfastly held its ground. In the past few days, the positions defended by the Li Weinuo division have been repeatedly bombarded by German aircraft and artillery, but they have remained unshaken. Yesterday, the Red Army in this division launched a counterattack and recaptured Village V. At the same time, the Red Army led by Gushina Zuof also recovered a very important stronghold, driving the enemy out of the railway line. In short, artillery fire cannot shake the determination of the defenders of Leningrad. The German fascists will never be able to enter the great city of Leningrad.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 22nd Dispatch, The Red Army led by Bujiakechik attacked the enemy on the northwest road yesterday, driving the enemy out of Village P. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Havas, Fuehrer's Headquarters, 22nd Dispatch, The Fuehrer's headquarters issued a special communique on Saturday night stating that, through the cooperation of the army, navy, and air force, the German army has occupied Oesel Island (at the entrance of the Gulf of Riga). The main city, Arensburg, has fallen. Oesel Island and Moon Island have now been officially occupied by the German army. There are still small groups of defenders on Oesel Island resisting stubbornly in the western corners, and they will be completely annihilated soon.</p>
<h3>London Holds "Tank Aid for the Soviet Union" Week, Maisky Makes Urgent Appeal, First Batch of Tanks Sets Sail for Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd Dispatch, Soviet Ambassador Maisky made a moving appeal today at the start of Britain's "Tank Aid for the Soviet Union" Week, saying, "We need tanks, the more the better. The Soviet Union also produces many tanks, but the losses on the 2,000-mile front are enormous. We need your urgent help to strengthen our efforts. The tanks you provide will not be wasted but will go into battle immediately. You certainly know how to use these tanks to resist our common enemy. The great battle of the entire Soviet army and people against the mechanized barbarian army of Hitler's Germany over the past three months is the best proof. The faster and more tanks you supply to us, the sooner the Nazi violence will be defeated. We are already standing with you on the common front, please immediately transport reinforcements of tanks to the front line that is now bearing the brunt of the war, and hope to transport them as quickly as possible within the scope of possibility. Those who help others at the right time and in the right place can achieve twice the result with half the effort."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd Dispatch, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky today visited several tank factories in the Midlands to "receive the first batch of tanks" made during "Tank Aid for the Soviet Union Week." The Soviet Ambassador's wife named the first Valentine tank "Stalin." The Soviet ambassador thanked on behalf of his country's people and army. After the handover ceremony, the tanks immediately departed for the docks to set sail for the Soviet Union. Several nearly completed tanks also had names such as "Marx," "Lenin," "Timoshenko," "Budyonny," and "Voroshilov" written on them.</p>
<h3>Greek King Arrives in England, Government Officials Accompany</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd Dispatch, King George of Greece arrived at a port in the north today. The Duke of Gloucester welcomed him on behalf of the King of England. The King of Greece, the Crown Prince, and the more important cabinet members came to England because they felt it was necessary to establish direct contact with the British government. King George visited England in 1924; this is his second time.</p>
<h3>Petain Calls on the People to Maintain Order, Condemns Anti-German Behavior</h3>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 22nd Dispatch, Marshal Petain made a three-minute broadcast yesterday afternoon, condemning those who attack the German occupation forces as acts of violence. He said that such acts of violence must be instigated by outsiders, only causing new disasters for the people. The government officially condemns such attacks and will do its best to arrest and punish the perpetrators. He hoped that the people would support the government with all their strength. If such crimes continue to develop, their reaction will harm innocent civilians. He knew the emotions of the people in the occupied areas and expressed deep sympathy for their difficulties. However, the people must not forget the important responsibility that the national crisis gives them to the entire country. Their necessary duty is to maintain the unity of the French nation in all kinds of environments and situations, and what this unity first requires of the people is to maintain order. He earnestly hoped that the people would work hard on this.</p>
<h3>Jewish New Year, Roosevelt Sends Congratulations</h3>
<p>Havas, New York, 21st Dispatch, Today is the New Year of the Jewish calendar 5702. President Roosevelt sent a telegram to celebrate. The telegram was read by Jewish leader Wise, and it read, "Although the world is now shrouded in darkness, we believe that it is only temporary and will not eliminate goodwill and peace. The American people are determined to complete their mission so that people of all countries can live together in peace."</p>
<h3>Ramadan in Cairo, Vigilance Remains High, People's Hatred of Germany Deepens</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 22nd Dispatch, During the Ramadan, which began last night, the blackout was not relaxed. In the past, during this month, the mosques in Cairo were brightly lit with candles, but this year they are only dimly lit. This breaks with centuries of tradition. Muslim cafes, which were usually open all night during this month to provide food and drink for those fasting, must now close half an hour after midnight. In the past, the minarets of mosques overlooking the entire city would fire a cannon at 2:00 AM to inform the fasting people to have their last meal of the night, followed by another cannon five minutes before dawn to announce that the time for fasting had arrived. This year, the sound of cannons is no longer heard and is replaced by drummers, who beat drums along the streets in Muslim residential areas to inform the public. All these precautions are due to Cairo recently being subjected to aerial bombing. Germans and Italians have always claimed to be protectors of Islam, but now Muslims hate them even more.</p>
<h3>Neutrality Act Debate Becomes a Problem, United States Nears Brink of War, Taylor to Have Final Meeting with Pope Before Leaving, Temporary Agreement Possible Between United States and Vatican</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd Dispatch, "New York Times" Washington correspondent Klock stated that there is a clear indication that the elements in Congress opposed to joining the war have now lost their unity. Many believe that when a proposal to repeal the Neutrality Act is put to a vote, the former opponents will change their attitude. The stance of the American Legion convention last week, the bad news from the Soviet Union, and Colonel Lindbergh's last speech in Des Moines are all major factors contributing to this change. According to those from the Midwestern states of the United States, Lindbergh's anti-war remarks are not well-received. A Washington correspondent for a Northwestern newspaper recently sought the opinions of 40 members of Congress returning to Washington from their home districts and found that some of them strongly opposed the president's straddling policy. When circumstances replace theory, especially when the policy has entered its war zone, members of Congress stop opposing the trend of this policy that they can no longer reverse. This is a common occurrence in American history.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, 21st Dispatch, Local authorities recently stated that two-thirds of the senators support amending the Neutrality Act.</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 22nd Dispatch, President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, flew to Lisbon today to board a clipper to the United States.</p>
<p>United Press, Vatican City, 22nd Dispatch, Sources in the Vatican indicated yesterday that President Roosevelt's private representative Taylor's 50-minute meeting with the Pope was not just a formal farewell but also their third and final meeting, to conduct a final review of events related to the United States and the Vatican. Taylor still denies all rumors about President Roosevelt having written a letter to the Pope, but many believe that the matters discussed in the President's handwritten note may include the temporary relationship between the United States and the Vatican once the United States enters the war. Judging from Taylor's gift of a luxurious Florentine villa worth $500,000 to the Pope, it can be seen that Taylor will not return to Italy. Diplomatic circles speculate that they do not know whether the White House recognizes that the United States will soon enter the war. In addition, one thing is worth noting: after Taylor bid farewell to the Pope, Mrs. Taylor visited the Pope again. If it were a normal ritual visit, the two would have visited at the same time. Some pointed out that if the United States declares war, it will be necessary to establish a temporary agreement between the United States and the Vatican for the exchange of financial diplomacy.</p>

The Prime Minister was absent due to illness, so Justice Minister Ashti introduced the new cabinet members to the parliament.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Switzerland, 21st – The "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" reports from the Iranian capital that since the establishment of the new Iranian cabinet, the national atmosphere has been refreshed. Iranian political and journalistic circles all hope that the new government will work diligently to improve the financial, economic, and social situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tehran, 22nd – At the beginning of the new king's accession, the Iranian parliament has begun to reform existing laws and customs and propose new policies, all of which no one dared to speak of a month ago. The biggest problem to be dealt with is patents. This system has reached the point where it is gradually extinguishing the driving force of individual commerce in Iran. Although national income has greatly increased, it has been used by the deposed king in an unconstitutional manner and turned into his private pocket. Another matter is that the Iranian people are determined not to allow the old despotism to revive, and that the parliament has supreme power in national politics. The 136 Iranian parliamentarians, who for the past 15 years have been intimidated by the deposed king and only obeyed orders as rubber stamps, now want to find a way to ensure that their rights stipulated in the constitution are respected forever. However, among the parliamentarians, there are those who advocate free elections and oppose the previous farcical elections, and there are also those who want to preserve their existing positions as much as possible. This kind of dispute may be one that is necessary in Iran's progress from despotism to democracy. At the same time, the British-Soviet front from West Africa via Eurasia to Murmansk is now intensifying its defenses to avoid dangerous gaps. The defense of the Caucasus is the main barrier to prevent Germany from extending into the world's largest oil fields, and it is now firmly held by the Soviet army. Behind the Soviet army, there are British troops to ensure the transportation of British and American goods into the Soviet Union. Various arrangements for the entry of supplies into the Soviet Union will soon be ready. Eliminating reactionary elements in the rear is an urgent task, so measures will be taken against the Axis elements in Iran, including 160 Germans and 4 Italians. The deposed king is still in Isfahan. It is reported that the new Iranian government has sent a special commissioner to Isfahan to ask the deposed king for a document to return the large amount of property he stole from the people of Iran to the Iranian people. These two commissioners arrived in Isfahan on Friday, but whether the deposed king will agree or not is currently unknown here.</p>
<p>Confiscation of the Ex-King's Property</p>
<p>Reuters, Tehran, 12th – An official order was issued here today that all movable and immovable property of the former King of Iran shall be transferred to the state. Those who have been unfairly punished by the former king will be secretly compensated.</p>
<h3>Syria; Formation of a New Cabinet; Al-Tadru to Issue; Declaration of New Regulations on Independence</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 21st – The British Broadcasting Corporation has just announced that the Prime Minister of the new Syrian cabinet, Hakim, has formed a cabinet of national unity. All political parties have participated, except for the extremist National Unity Party. A new post of Minister of Defense has been added to the cabinet, which is in accordance with the President's wishes.</p>
<p>Reuters, Damascus, 22nd – The new Syrian cabinet has been formed. It is expected that General Catroux, Commander-in-Chief of the Free French Forces in the Middle East, will issue a declaration on the new regulations on Syrian independence.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Puppet; Sucking the People's Blood; German Authorities Demand Money</h3>
<p>TASS, Stockholm, 22nd – Quisling, the puppet leader of Norway, used his position to plunder the people's wealth and accumulate a large private fortune. The German authorities discovered this and ordered Quisling to hand over the funds he deposited in Norwegian banks to the Germans within three days. In fact, Quisling had already remitted the deposits abroad.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Troops on the Border; Threatening Turkey; Britain Expresses Determination to Fulfill Treaty Obligations; German Ambassador to Turkey to Return to Post Today</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 21st – Observers here yesterday believed that Bulgaria's declaration of a "state of emergency" was intended to tighten domestic control. Many believe that Bulgaria is preparing to attack Turkey, so this kind of domestic control is necessary. It is also believed that Bulgaria's attack on Turkey will wait for the clarification of the German military situation in southern Russia. Britain is watching Turkey and pointed out that the Imperial Army is ready to advance from the rear to assist in the battle when the Bulgarian army invades Turkish Thrace. According to reports, Bulgaria has accepted German orders and is fully prepared to take joint military action with Germany. 17 Bulgarian divisions have been mobilized, two of which are concentrating on the Bulgarian-Turkish border. Although observers believe that Hitler is willing to have Bulgaria come out to help because he feels the difficulty of his own manpower, they doubt that Bulgaria is being driven by us to fight against the Soviet Union, because Bulgaria and her sentiments are pro-Soviet. However, most of Bulgaria (including the Bulgarian king and military leaders) openly maintain a traditional anti-Turkish policy. It is reported that Turkey recently rejected Germany's request to control the Dardanelles Strait, because Turkey has been threatened by Germany since Germany controlled the Aegean Islands.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Ankara, 22nd – The German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, will fly from Berlin to Istanbul tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 22nd – The German negotiator, Clodius, has almost completed his plan regarding the quantity of agricultural products between Germany and Turkey. However, discussions on the quantity of minerals are still in progress.</p>
<p>Turkish Consul General in New York Commits Suicide</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 22nd – The Turkish Consul General in New York, Nukselan, committed suicide in his apartment yesterday. His wife and servants found his body lying on the bed, with a tie around his neck and his hands still tightly holding the tie. The police said that the Consul General apparently committed suicide due to ill health and disappointment with the political situation.</p>
<h3>British Aid China Committee; Holds Garden Party</h3>
<p>London, 20th – A special cable reports that the Aid China Committee held a garden party here today. Celebrities attending the meeting included Ambassador Gu Weijun, Mr. and Mrs. Guo Bingwen, Mr. and Mrs. Maisky, and the chairman of the committee, Grants, and Secretary Friedman. The Chinese goods sales office in the venue was extremely crowded, and the sales proceeds will be used as part of the £1,000 donation for the Double Tenth Festival.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Rack Their Brains; Making Sausages with Cat and Dog Meat; Many Unscrupulous Merchants Arrested</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 22nd – Hundreds of foreigners learned today that the sausages and ham they were eating were made of cat and dog meat and were greatly shocked. This food was illegally manufactured and served in famous hotels and restaurants in Tokyo. These people took advantage of the lack of meat and made ham and sausages from cat and dog meat for sale and profit. 500 people were involved, and 50 have been arrested. These people have produced no less than 70,000 pounds of ham and sausages. The police announced that the arrested people were all dishonest butchers, sausage and ham manufacturers and vendors. They are active in Tokyo and its neighboring seven prefectures, and large-scale and famous manufacturers are also involved.</p>

<h3>Finance; It is Said That Black Market Exchange Rates Have Been Completely Eliminated; Why is There Still Talk of Underground Gold Trading on the Market?; As Long as Positions Match, There is No Fear of Not Being Able to Make a Deal</h3>
<p>Recently, newspapers have been saying that black market exchange rates have been eliminated, with "quoting classics and scriptures," as if everything is justified, and people think it is true. But the fact is that black market exchange rates have been transacted from time to time in recent days. Yesterday, the Banque de l'Indochine sold US dollars at 4.625 yuan, which was bought by a foreign company that was not allowed to apply. It is also heard that not only banks outside the 14 are secretly active, as long as the positions of both parties match, the bank can transfer money to New York, because the market price is 4.75 yuan, which is still 0.125 yuan less than the black market exchange rate. Since the price is more expensive than the black market exchange rate, who is willing to settle export foreign exchange with the 14 banks, and the commission earned by doing bank business is better than 0.3125 yuan, how can there be no reason to half-heartedly agree? Therefore, to insist that the black market exchange rate has been eliminated is nothing more than deceiving people and creating a smokescreen. Many news articles are "self-promotion" by people in the industry, and are there no "works for the government" in academic papers? Even if it is a "non-Chinese merchant," it can still buy and sell black market exchange rates, or use US dollars instead. It is said that the US dollars circulating in Shanghai range from 50 million to 30 million US dollars. Part of it is kept by people with financial resources, and part of it is currently circulating in the market. This US dollar is rising due to strong demand. The rise of the British pound yesterday was to promote the idea that the British pound, which is inconvenient to use, will also rise, to cover up the reason why the US dollar is rising is to replace the US exchange rate. Some people also think that US dollars can replace US exchange rates, so can't British pounds replace British exchange rates? But don't forget the British government's handling of the British pound, which cannot be as free as the current US dollar. I wonder if the US government has the determination to freeze it, will it allow the US dollar to roam freely outside the body, and make an exception not to deal with it. As for the Shanghai Chinese merchants' speculators, the long and short positions of more than one million US dollars are still being held. Until the evening close, the British exchange rate was about 2 pence 8125, and the US dollar was 4.6875 yuan, which was 0.0625 yuan tighter than last Saturday. The Hong Kong exchange rates on the 21st remained unchanged. The opening price in Tianjin was flat, the London telegraphic transfer was 0.0625 yuan tighter, which was 3 pence, the New York telegraphic transfer remained unchanged, still standing at 5 yuan, the Shanghai exchange rate fell by 1 yuan, which was 85.5 yuan, and the "Lianchao" market rose by 2.12 yuan, which was 47.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Not Weakened; Retreats to the 9,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market was also an underground market, and the futures fluctuated narrowly, only 10 yuan high or low that day, hovering around the closing price of 6,895 yuan last Saturday, and finally settled 2 yuan lower, with a turnover of more than 500 taels. Cash turned downwards, retreating to the 9,000 yuan mark. A certain atmosphere came from Hong Kong, and people's hearts were soft. When Defu first came out in the morning, the spot price was 9,080 yuan for ten taels, which was 10 yuan lower. Chengji spot gold shops entered, rising to 9,090 yuan, and suddenly saw Xianghe, Deda, and Decheng sell out, and negative rumors also arose, retreating to the 9,000 yuan mark. Zhongxing and Xiangxingyong bought in, and it rose to 9,020 yuan at noon. In the early afternoon, it fell by 10 yuan, and the gold shops sold 50 taels from the bank, at 9,010 yuan. Mingfeng sold 70 taels, Chengji sold 60 taels, and Junxiangxingyong bought them all, at a price of 9,000 yuan. Finally, the banks did 20 taels with each other, and the closing price at 3:30 was 9,005 yuan, which was 85 yuan lower than the noon price last Saturday, with a high or low of 90 yuan, and the turnover was about 600 taels. The gold shops' own brand gold was 9,050 yuan at the storefront, with a reduction of 200 yuan for buying back, and jewelry was also 10 yuan lower, at 920 yuan.</p>
<p>Futures Fluctuations Become Narrower</p>
<p>The opening price of the October gold futures (ten taels each) was 5 yuan higher, at 6,900 yuan, when Tianyuan first entered Jufengyong 20 taels. Yili and Jinyuan sold out, falling back to 6,890 yuan. Then, Xiangxingyong and Decheng covered their short positions, rising to 6,895 yuan. Tianyuan and Litai sold out, falling to 6,892 yuan. The noon closing price was 6,894 yuan. The market opened at 6,892 yuan at 2:00 p.m., which was 2 yuan lower. Tianyuan made a small entry, and the market was flat. Later, until the closing at 3:30, the price was 6,893 yuan, which was 2 yuan lower than the closing price last Saturday, with a high or low of 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices are 10 Yuan Lower</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry per tael was 10 yuan lower at 3:30 p.m. at Datongxing and Xintongxing, at 920 yuan, with a reduction of 50 yuan for buying back, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Rises and Falls Intermittently</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, the British pound and the US dollar fell by 5 yuan along with the spot price, the British pound bill fell by 1 yuan, the US dollar bill trended firmly, and still stood at 12.5 yuan in the evening market. The Hong Kong bill also remained unchanged, the Japanese gold bill fell by 0.01 yuan, and retreated to 2.35 yuan in the evening market, while the Korean bill continued to rise by 0.01 yuan, and rose to 2.06 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Securities; Bond Market is Apathetic; Stock Prices Also Decline Rapidly</h3>
<p>The underground market for public bonds, the market yesterday did not stop circling. Although the C bonds were once raised to 2 yuan, they were still slightly suppressed. Fortunately, most of the major players did not intend to sell them, so it is not easy to see the size of the face. Yesterday's transactions were also clearly reduced. Jufeng, Yitai, and Tiansheng bought in the morning, and Xiexingyuan, Jiucheng, and Lemao all sold out. The C bonds once saw a small price of 1.65 yuan. In the afternoon, China Trust Bank and Yuxinghao specialized in selling A and B bonds, and Dahua and Lianhe generally supplied them. Juxin, Yitai, and Gongmao bought C bonds, and once excitedly saw a market price of 2 yuan, but still closed at 1.7 yuan. People's hearts are apathetic, and it is difficult to be optimistic in the short term. As a result, except for the A bonds, which did not have a high or low, the rest were slightly smaller by 0.1 yuan to 0.3 yuan, and the turnover was only about 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>The turnover in the stock market was 50 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company, at a price of 68 yuan each.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Stock Exchange had extremely large transactions and fluctuating prices. The opening price in the morning was low, and after opening, it became more upward. The long party came in at a low price, and the noon closing price was slightly higher. The afternoon opening price fell in a straight line until the closing. The turnover of rubber stocks was less than that of industrial stocks, so the rise and fall were not very large.</p>
<p>Yangtze Silver Company shares and new stock rights have now been calculated separately, so the price listed yesterday was the new price after the rights were removed.</p>
<h3>Grain; Although Rice Prices Have Fallen; Rice Quality is More Mixed; Reporting is Only in Name; Door-to-Door Sales Lack Standards</h3>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Taikoo Company's Chengdu ship arrived at the port on Saturday afternoon, transporting 3,755 bags of foreign rice directly from Siam, and stopped at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. Yesterday, the Thai ship Suriyathai Nawa, managed by the Taishengli Company, also arrived at the port yesterday morning, transporting 3,700 tons of foreign rice, totaling more than 38,000 bags, from Siam, and stopped at the Longmao warehouse in Pudong for unloading. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice was flat at first, then rose, and then returned to stability. The market price was 2-3 yuan higher than the previous weekend. Because there were many arrivals and stocks when the market opened in the morning, the incoming and outgoing were evenly matched, and the market price did not rise or fall. Later, because new customers added to the office at the beginning of the week, and large players inside and outside the industry took advantage of the flatness to absorb, and speculators borrowed the public sale of small jiaozis by the Public Concession Bureau, which had not been suppressed for a long time, and continued to approve them, and the orders had not been officially agreed upon for many days, they used this to create rumors and support the price. Although the current situation has no stimulating developments, the market price of foreign rice was finally kicked up by a group of leather balls. The spot price of small jiaozis has risen to 109 yuan, the road cargo Yinghua Si has risen to 137 yuan, and the current Yinghua Si is 126.5 yuan, 128 yuan, and 131 yuan, which have all risen by 2-3 yuan compared to Saturday. However, after the price was high, the buying interest gradually faded, so it was flat in the afternoon. The total turnover for the day reached more than 30,000 bags, and Yinghua Si also arrived at more than 1,000 tons. Rice merchants have become rich overnight in these two years. Not only have they earned double the profits from the price of rice, but they have also searched for everything from the quality and quantity of rice. The current rice only has its name, but it is not true. The price is only set according to the nominal price, but in reality, it is mixed and sold as much as possible. Since the price of various small jiaozi rice has fallen below the price of the rice of the Public Concession Bureau, the price of the rice of the Public Concession Bureau has remained firm, with some still listed at 117 yuan, some at 107 yuan, 08 yuan, and even 04 yuan. Some have also removed the Public Concession Bureau rice sign, and the rice sold is ugly and bad. Although the Public Concession Bureau encourages people to report it, they do not know what the rice of the Public Concession Bureau is like before it can be truly consistent with the name. Moreover, to report the rice, it is best to have public officials as witnesses, which is not possible for a while. Furthermore, the rice sold in rice shops is not just one kind, so you can rely on it and be implicated in it. Therefore, the report is theoretically feasible, but it will not happen in reality. It is no wonder that rice merchants dare to do evil and harm the public.</p>
<p>Both thick and thin japonica rice have shown a downward trend, because the source is accumulating, and the sales market has been rising for several days, and suddenly feels that the price is high and棘手, so it turns its attention to foreign rice, and the market is difficult to stand on. The prices of both new and broken japonica rice have fallen downstream, and the early broken Nanfang Port is even more discounted, reaching as much as 3-4 yuan, opening at 150 yuan, and then to 147.5 yuan. Pudong's new japonica rice has fallen by 1-2 yuan, opening at 152.5 yuan, and 151.5 yuan. As for thick broken rice, it is still out of stock and has no market.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice has always followed the lead of foreign rice. Now that the season is good and the retail is smooth, there are also large players absorbing, so they follow the trend and rise by 4-5 yuan. It is estimated that the special white yuan in Hong Kong opens at 134-5 yuan, the middle grade is up to 130 yuan, and the lower grade also needs 128 yuan. Glutinous tea opens at 116.5 yuan, and then to 114.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Should Be Stable; But There is Still a Lot of Activity Outside the Market</h3>
<p>The inventory of foreign flour is always in the hundreds of thousands of bags, and digestion is mainly in retail. The entire batch of transshipment is also rarely seen, so the market seems to be temporarily stable. Under the current non-stimulating situation, speculation and manipulation are impossible. However, yesterday, because there were actual sales added to the office on Monday, and there were also large players outside the industry taking advantage of the flat file to absorb, the opening price was strong and the shouting was very high. However, because the Huai households were unable to fully purchase due to the ban in the market, the skin ball players were active in the black market of the black market outside the market. Jinlong Xizhan rose from 30.09 yuan to 31.4 yuan, Dongzhan rose from 31.6 yuan to 32 yuan, and Paozhai rose from 32.7 yuan to 33.1 yuan, all of which rose by 0.5-0.6 yuan compared to the previous weekend. Wheat bran is scarce in both inflow and outflow, and there is also a lack of a regular market for wheat. However, with the rise of rice flour in both markets, the market shape is generally upright.</p>
<p>As for the foreign flour that arrived in Shanghai, the Meilun DagrnaRSalen, managed by the Hualun Foreign Company, arrived from Canada the day before yesterday (Sunday), carrying 306 tons of flour, about 15,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton; The Walls of the Long and Short Sides Are Strict; The Yarn Market Turns Into a Stalemate</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and it is becoming more and more difficult to rise and unable to fall, turning into a stalemate. The bulls absorb a lot, so the table feels very dry, but the shorts say that the international situation is still changing and unpredictable, and the yarn market in the stock exchange is extremely weak, so they still hold the idea of selling whenever the price rises. Therefore, the walls on both sides are extremely strong. As for the current yarn sales, there is still no sign of prosperity. The Hong Kong helpers' purchases are lacking. The high price of 20-count Shuangma is 1,754 yuan, and the low price is 1,743 yuan. The opening price in the afternoon was 1,742 yuan, rising to 1,747 yuan. Then rumors came and fell to 1,737 yuan. The closing price rebounded slightly to 1,742 yuan. Currently, the buyers in the yarn market say that banknotes are flooding, and the sellers say that the base price has entered a high territory, and it will not enter unless it falls, so the competition is fierce. I wonder what the degree of change will be in the future.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, because there were rumors in the afternoon of the previous day, and Molly was in a panic. Before the opening, the price fell and the situation was chaotic. The opening price was slightly different, and the listed price was 1,750 yuan. People's hearts were still stable. After a while, it fell to 1,743 yuan. Later, the stock exchange opened in a weak state, and the popularity was quiet. The shorts covered their positions, the large players dragged in, and it continued to rise to 1,754 yuan. However, it was heard that the sales market was prosperous for a long time, and the market situation returned to 1,745 yuan. However, the closing situation was still good, at 1,748 yuan. It was found that the total turnover in half a day was 8,925 bags. The amount purchased by each helper is listed on the left,</p>
<p>Hong Kong 25 Fellow Traders 8,900</p>
<p>Total 8,925</p>
<p>The Jinbianma futures market situation is slightly undulating, and the Zhong shrinks narrowly. All the helpers are watching and not moving forward. The table trading is scarce. When it opened in the morning, foreign cotton continued to fall sharply, and there was more silence in the news. People's hearts were panicked and they were quite impatient, so the floating long first sold out, the factory orders were soft, and the opening of the futures yarn was weak. The September period has stopped trading, and the December period has begun to appear. Scattered longs have sold out, and new shorts have followed the selling, and the trading in the market is scarce. It is completely controlled by the sellers, so the opening price of the October period is 1,664 yuan, which is 7 yuan lower. The November period is 1,678 yuan, which is also 7 yuan lower. The December period was initially made at 1,700 yuan. After entering, it fell again because the stock exchange once went downstream. Then, it gradually rebounded through the purchase of scattered retail investors. There was no significant entry or exit, so the rise and fall were quite ordinary. In the afternoon, the buying intention in the market was slightly stronger, and the feet were slightly fixed. By the closing, each had rebounded by about 3-4 yuan. As a result, the recent period closed at 1,664.5 yuan, down 6.5 yuan, November was 1,676 yuan, also slightly down 9 yuan, and December was 1,704.5 yuan, which was slightly up 4.5 yuan compared to the opening. The transaction price list is listed below.</p>
<h3>The US Government's Loan Cotton Sales Price; About 5-600 Pounds Cheaper; Manufacturers in This Port Are Ordering in Groups</h3>
<p>The Shanghai lookout for foreign cotton trading is good because the US government's loan cotton sales price is quite cheap, and all Chinese and foreign yarn factories are keen to purchase. The news of this came last week, and after exploration by various cotton foreign companies, it has been active and competitive among various factories and counterparts in a brand-new posture on Saturday and today. The cheap price is about 5-600 pounds lower than the current spot market in the United States, so there is no doubt that it is a good opportunity for various factories to offset the original cotton. However, there are still some troubles in various procedures, and it is impossible to predict whether it will succeed or not, so a small number of counterparts are still watching.</p>
<p>The current cotton situation is that people's hearts are unanimously looking high, but the environment does not allow it. Secondly, the recent US cotton has been going downstream, and it has fallen more than 100 pounds from its peak. In addition, the yarn market is ordinary, and the 32-count and 41-count yarns are trending downstream, so the cotton market is greatly affected. Yesterday, the transfer of coarse and fine raw cotton was still active, because the actual demand was good, and the factory's stomach was still healthy.</p>

<h3>Piece Goods; Yihuo's Futures Coarse Cloth; 1 Yuan More Expensive Than the Current Market</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth The market yesterday trended firm, because the actual sales continued to be good. The sales disc rose because the factory's opening price was high. Yihuo Factory's futures coarse cloth was about 1 yuan more expensive than the current market. More than 1,000 pieces were opened yesterday, and the current cloth market price was affected and rose. The coarse cloth rose by 0.25 yuan to 0.5 yuan per piece, a part of the fine cloth twill rose by 0.25 yuan, and the Jin Sanda and other brands of bleached cloth rose by 0.5 yuan. The color cloth was flat. The turnover in this street was more than 500 pieces. The Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang helpers handled more than 400 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, bleached cloth, and twill. The Zhudong Dinghai helper handled 50-60 pieces of coarse cloth and twill.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth The futures cloth in the Stock Exchange declined with the yarn, falling by 0.4 yuan to 0.5 yuan per piece, while the fine cloth and fine twill in the spot market were still prosperous in the dyeing factory on this street. The morning disc was slightly tired, and the market tightened in the afternoon. There was not much difference from the previous weekend, but the Sijunzi Serge fell by 0.015 yuan per yard due to the sale of the hoarders. The new order new tax at the evening closing was 2.22 yuan, and the new order old tax was 2.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Abundant Supply, Edible Oil Prices Plunge, Large Quantities of New Soybeans Arriving</h3>
<p>Actual sales of edible oil are still relatively slow, while goods from various regions are continuously being shipped to Shanghai, causing sellers to no longer dare to hold out and eager to sell. The factory price of soybean oil has fallen below 200 yuan, to 190 yuan, a sharp drop of more than 10 yuan compared to before. Other oils are also weakening. However, futures prices were supported because many rice merchants are still struggling to recover losses, so the market trend was repeatedly halted from falling further. The final result was not significantly different from before. Overall market sales included over 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 100 dan of soybean oil from Dayou Factory, 200 dan of rapeseed oil, over 4,000 dan of clear oil futures, 200 dan of rapeseed oil from Lide Factory, and 50 barrels of rapeseed oil from Taishan Factory, around 3,000 barrels of rapeseed oil futures from Rihua Lian (prices detailed in the market price section). Yesterday, 280 pieces of soybean oil and 200 pieces of butter arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<p>New soybeans from various regions are arriving steadily, and it is rumored that large quantities are on the way, causing considerable pessimism. Yesterday, 300 bags of Guide soybeans, over 100 bags of Jiaozhou soybeans, and over 300 bags of Changzhou and Lucheng "cowhide beans" were sold on this street. Prices have fallen by half a yuan to over a yuan compared to before. Yesterday, 1,000 bags of beans arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Sugar Quotations Slightly Rise, More Granulated Sugar Arriving</h3>
<p>The sugar market experienced a rise after an initial fall yesterday. According to Dutch telegraphs, the December shipment price for coarse white sugar was USD 7.50, also showing a slight increase according to the C.I.F. K.G. example. The guild quoted spot prices for 14 coarse white sugar: 35 yuan 3 jiao for September arrivals, a rise of 6 jiao; 134 yuan 5 jiao for July, a rise of 5 jiao; 34 yuan for June, a rise of 6 jiao. Dutch raw sugar saw no transactions. Spot Hong Kong coarse white sugar was at 125 yuan 6 jiao, rising to 26 yuan 6 jiao to 7 yuan in the afternoon. Re-export goods were at 105 yuan 5 jiao to 6 jiao.

<h3>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Appeals to All Parties to Jointly Maintain the Rule of Law and Tranquility, Hopes Residents and Political Groups will Assist in Maintaining the International Status of the International Settlement</h3>
<p>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Liddell, published a notice last night (September 22nd), the translation of which is as follows: "On Sunday afternoon, an incident occurred in the International Settlement where a Japanese resident was shot, adding to the recent violence in the Settlement. In the past months, the International Settlement has been the location of sporadic acts of terror, with most victims being Chinese. However, recently, the violent acts of the thugs have been focused on the murders and attempted murders of some Japanese residents. The International Settlement is an international area. Although it has been affected by the clouds of war, it remains a safe haven for millions of civilians, the majority of whom are Chinese. However, Chinese thugs are disrupting public order within the Settlement, harming all residents. As the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, I have a responsibility to inform all sectors of the community and to expect all residents of the Settlement, as well as all political groups and parties, to listen to my words and give me their assistance. I dare to ask them to do their best and use all their powers to ensure that the rule of law and tranquility can be restored to the International Settlement, so that the residents can live in peace as they deeply desire, and maintain the international status of the International Settlement, so that all residents can benefit from it. I have high hopes. Signed, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Liddell."</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Should Maintain the Status Quo of the Settlement with the Greatest Determination, Administrative Sovereignty Must Be Complete and Independent, Mutual Cooperation Must be Strong</h3>
<p>The recent developments have cast a shadow over the future of the International Settlement. Millions of Chinese and Western people in the city have always expressed great concern for the integrity and independence of the administrative sovereignty of the Settlement. If the administrative sovereignty is partially infringed or if the power of one country is particularly expanded, it will hinder the maintenance of the balance of power in the Settlement and the legitimate interests of all parties. This cannot be tolerated or accepted by any righteous person. According to well-informed sources, the reporter of the New Voice Newspaper analyzed the new crisis recently encountered by the International Settlement based on this principle. It is said that any idea or behavior of concession or compromise cannot maintain the current status of the Settlement, nor can it make the future situation more satisfactory than the present. The best way to deal with the crisis is to adopt a firm stance, backed by the cooperation of the countries concerned, and reject demands from any party to change the status quo of the Settlement. Otherwise, the century-old legal status of Shanghai will completely collapse. In other words, the Shanghai Settlement has become a battlefield for international forces. Based on the current situation and for the sake of safeguarding the interests of millions of Chinese and Western people in the city, at this critical moment, Britain and the United States should unite with other countries, stand together firmly, support the status of the Shanghai Settlement, and maintain the independence and neutrality of the administrative sovereignty of the Settlement. Although the international situation may change, the policies adopted by Britain and the United States for the Shanghai situation must always be based on this principle. At the same time, other countries should also distinguish between right and wrong, make choices, and cooperate with Britain and the United States. In this way, not only can the current status of the Settlement be maintained, but the prosperity of the Settlement in the future can also be foreseen. The Chinese people themselves should also do their best to contribute to this.</p>
<h3>Severe Inspection of Mail at Route Massenet Post Office, Sudden Increase in Japanese Inspectors</h3>
<p>Since the entry of Japanese personnel to inspect mail at the Route Massenet Post Office, all kinds of mail, including regular letters, express letters, registered mail, and parcels in mailboxes, have been inspected. Newspapers and printed matter are especially likely to be confiscated. The number of inspection personnel suddenly increased to eight yesterday, and they arrived at the post office earlier, so that even the early shift's mail for delivery was inspected.</p>
<h3>Mastermind of Mamatov Assassination Transferred to Japanese Authorities, Will Be Returned to Police After Interrogation</h3>
<p>Russian émigré Mamatov was shot and killed on the afternoon of the 13th of this month at the entrance of his residence on Route Lafayette. The French police ordered the arrest of the perpetrator. The French police arrested the perpetrator Liu Fanglin, who confessed that he was instigated by a Mr. Pang and a Russian translator, Zhang Xinwu. Based on the confession, the police sent detectives and apprehended the instigator, Zhang Xinwu. According to Zhang, he was entrusted by a Russian named An Xue Li Gu Li Gai (transliteration) living at 317 Rue de Poussy, who was willing to pay a reward of 2,000 yuan to arrange the assassination of the deceased. Therefore, he entrusted a civilian to contact Mr. Pang, who then entrusted Liu Fanglin to carry out the killing. An initial reward of 200 yuan was paid. Based on Zhang's confession, the police also arrested the Russian mastermind</p>
<p>An Xue Li Gu Li Gai.</p>
<p>According to his confession, he used to be an actor in a Russian theater and made a living writing magazines. A month ago, the deceased publicly stated that the civilian did not have a legitimate occupation and was a rogue. Therefore, I directly questioned him and reported him to the police, but the case disappeared without a trace. Other than that, there was no deep-seated hatred. I really don't know about his assassination this time, and I didn't entrust anyone to assassinate him. Based on the confessions of the above-mentioned individuals, the police ordered them to be detained together for further investigation. Yesterday morning, a Japanese military police team suddenly sent personnel to the French police, claiming to be investigating the Russian An Xue Li Gu Li Gai, who had committed a</p>
<p>major international case,</p>
<p>and requested permission to take him into custody for interrogation. After the police reported this to the French Concession authorities for approval, they granted the request and sent the Russian suspect An Xue Li Gu Li Gai to the personnel for handling. However, the personnel were informed that after interrogating the suspect, he should still be sent back to the French police for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Sale of British Church Property, Voting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Regarding the sale of the land along Henan Road from Hankou Road to Jiujiang Road owned by the British Church on Jiangxi Road to raise funds to purchase the buildings of the Western Children's School on No. 90 Road, it is rumored that the donors had a heated debate at the meeting yesterday. Opponents claimed that the location of the school was close to the bustling city center and was quite unsuitable, and there was no need to purchase it at all. Even the church itself should be moved to western Shanghai to facilitate the travel of the church members. It is understood that this case will be voted on at tomorrow's meeting. British residents who are over 21 years old and have resided in Shanghai for more than six months have the right to vote.</p>
<h3>High Tide Exceeds Forecast, Suddenly Surges Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Huangpu Bureau's forecast, there would be another high tide in the Huangpu River starting the day before yesterday, with a predicted height of only about 11 feet. However, at 2:00 PM yesterday, the high tide reached about 13 feet, and the riverbank on North Suzhou Road was flooded. The stone steps of the China Industrial Bank's godown were also submerged, forcing pedestrians to detour. Gansu Road and Arrabal Street were completely submerged, and the water only receded after a long time.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Musical Recital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club's regular meeting this week is scheduled to be held at noon on September 25th (Thursday) on the second floor of the Metropole Hotel.

<h3>War Losses in Various Industries Can Be Fully Deducted in the Current Year, Listed as a One-Time Expense When Calculating Income</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance approved the amortization of war losses suffered by various industrial and commercial enterprises over a period of ten years, it has now abolished the amortization method and formulated two measures, ordering various industries to comply. They are recorded as follows: (1) War losses suffered by various industrial and commercial enterprises are allowed to be listed as a one-time expense when calculating the current year's income for the collection of income tax, and then verified and exempted according to law. If the above-mentioned war losses are insufficient to offset the current year's income, they cannot be compensated in the income of the following year in accordance with Article 17 of the Collection Instructions for Class I Income Tax. (2) The remaining balance of war losses incurred in previous years that have not been fully amortized by the end of the 30th year is allowed to be listed as a one-time expense in the income of the 30th year.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Restricts the Deposit and Withdrawal of Legal Tender to Prevent Export for Profit, and Prohibits the Issuance of Drafts to Shanghai, Which Has No Significant Impact on Shanghai-Hong Kong Commerce</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong government's newly promulgated regulations restricting the withdrawal of legal tender deposits have no serious impact on Shanghai commerce. According to the new regulations, legal tender depositors are prohibited from withdrawing legal tender, and they are also not allowed to issue drafts to individuals, firms, or banks in Shanghai. Withdrawals are only allowed for household expenses and savings, and checks are only allowed to be issued to local residents in Hong Kong. The promulgation of these new regulations is intended to prevent the escape of legal tender funds. Since the price of Hong Kong currency is higher than the price of Shanghai currency, people often smuggle legal tender from Hong Kong for export profit. At one point, one Hong Kong dollar was worth five legal tender dollars in Shanghai, while one Hong Kong dollar was worth more than six legal tender dollars in Hong Kong. Although the Shanghai Customs has stipulated that each passenger carrying legal tender from Hong Kong to Shanghai shall not carry more than 1,500 yuan to restrict this, the amount of legal tender carried by many passengers often exceeds the limit by a considerable amount.</p>
<h3>The Maosheng Vessel is Released for Export</h3>
<p>The Maosheng vessel of Jardine Matheson, a British company, sailed to Shanghai on the 7th of this month on the order of the British Navy Department from Singapore. After loading goods for the use of the British Navy Department in Shanghai, it sailed back to Capiz on the 9th of this month. It is learned that the vessel was loaded with about 1,000 tons of machinery such as pumps, which were approved by the Jianghai Customs for export declaration. However, it was seized by the Japanese authorities. The British Consulate General made representations and explained that the loaded pumps and other items were for the use of the British Navy. A reporter from the New Voice Newspaper learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Japanese authorities have investigated and approved the release. The vessel left Wusong at 4:40 PM on the 21st of this month and sailed to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Mail to Hunan Province Can Still Be Sent, Remittances to Fuzhou Resume</h3>
<p>Light mail to various parts of southern Hunan Province, whether express, registered, or regular letters, or postcards, will still be collected and delivered as usual. At the same time, the postal savings and remittance bureau will also continue to issue drafts for remittances to various parts of Hunan Province. The daily remittance limit for each person in Changsha and other places is 200 yuan, and there are detailed regulations on the additional water fee and remittance fee to be charged. Therefore, the post office hopes that citizens will not easily post mail unless it is necessary to avoid congestion and loss. Regarding remittances to Fuzhou, the issuance of drafts was previously suspended due to the special circumstances in the area. The Shanghai postal remittance bureau believes that the order in the area has been restored and that it is necessary to facilitate the issuance of drafts to the area for merchants and the public. After lengthy negotiations, everything is ready. It is learned that the issuance of these drafts has been resumed yesterday, with a limit of 50 yuan per person per day, and an additional water fee and remittance fee of 8 fen per yuan will be charged uniformly.</p>
<h3>Advisor to the King of Arabia Visits Japan and Shanghai, Feels the Various Hardships Faced by Japan Now, and the Policy of Force is Difficult to Achieve Peace</h3>
<p>Former advisor to the King of Arabia and current secretary of the World Islamic Congress, Basheer Shulihev, was invited by the Japanese government to visit Japan. He has recently come to Shanghai from Japan and told a reporter from the Great China News Agency yesterday: "Japan is currently facing various hardships due to selfish ideas. We can say with certainty that Japan never thought that such difficult problems would arise today." Basheer said,</p>
<p>Mutual Respect is Necessary for Cooperation</p>
<p>The purpose of the World Islamic Congress is to work for a new order, but this new order must be based on mutual benefit and cooperation. Therefore, we firmly oppose the adoption of methods that violate this basic principle to solve various problems. Sino-Japanese peace is unlikely unless Japan can adopt a well-intentioned and peaceful method, abandon military action, and conduct negotiations. I firmly believe that disputes cannot be resolved by force, and even if they can be resolved by force, it is difficult to consolidate their position. Since the beginning of Japanese history, Japan has been greatly influenced by China in terms of lifestyle. Therefore, in my opinion, Japan should realize that it should use constructive methods to repay the great favor it received from China in the past. The basic principle of cooperation is mutual respect, which cannot be brought about by force. Therefore, if this principle is violated, the results will be the opposite.</p>
<p>Arabs Love Freedom</p>
<p>The above principles can also be applied to European countries. If leading countries can act with mutual respect, small and weak nations will naturally welcome them to lead them. Arabs have always been a nation that loves freedom. Nazi forces have no chance of penetrating Arabia. The recent incident in Iraq proves that Nazi forces have no foothold in Arabia. The current situation in Arabia is very normal and there is no change. Although affected by the European war, all political activities are focused on one goal, which is to help the democratic countries win and develop a fully free social system. We believe that unity is the most important thing, because without unity, it is impossible to obtain prosperity.</p>

<h3>Case of Conductor Pushing Passenger to Death, Police Request Maximum Penalty, Defendant's Behavior is Heinous and the Crime is Unforgivable, Trial Concluded and Sentence Scheduled to Be Announced, Perjury Detained</h3>
<p>At 1:30 PM on the 13th of this month, Xiang Dongchuan (42 years old, residing at No. 23 Cihou Lane, Seymour Road), a Wenzhou native who used to work at the Salt Affairs Bureau, was riding an English-owned B-352 trolleybus on Route 20. When he got off the bus at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road, he accused Wang Wanxiang, the ticket seller from Haimen on bus No. 358, of pocketing the change and failing to give him the ticket for the two jiao fare he had paid. When he demanded it back, Wang Wanxiang became angry out of embarrassment and pushed Xiang Dongchuan off the bus, causing him to fall and injure his head. He was taken to the hospital, but died shortly after. The offending ticket seller, Wang Wanxiang, was taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station by Chinese Deputy Detective Liao Guihe and Detective Lu Shouchang and escorted to the First Special Court. Jiang Jing, a student from St. John's Middle School who was a passenger on the same bus, testified in court that the defendant had pushed the deceased off the bus because he had failed to pocket the change. The court adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<p>Public Outrage</p>
<p>However, after this news was disclosed by this newspaper, the public was indignant at the ticket seller's blatant pocketing of change and Xiang's untimely death. There was an uproar of public opinion. Yesterday morning, this case was due to be continued. The police summoned all the witnesses and escorted Wang to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Judge Shi presided over the hearing. The defendant was defended by Li Gengxiang, the perennial legal counsel of the trolleybus company, and the family of the deceased also hired lawyers Jiang Baoli and Jiang Pingfan to appear in court to file a civil suit. First, the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a prosecution in accordance with Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for the crime of murder, stating that according to the autopsy report of the procuratorate and the forensic doctor, it was proven that the deceased died from being pushed and falling, injuring the back of his head.</p>
<p>Witnesses in Court</p>
<p>Yesterday, two other witnesses, Xu Shenjin and Yan Defa, appeared in court. Xu Shenjin was injured when he fell at the same time as the deceased. Yan Defa attacked the testimony of Jiang Jing, who testified in court last time, as unreliable. He was accompanied to the police station by a Westerner named Miller from the trolleybus company. According to Yan's statement at the police station, he lived in the same room as Jiang Jing. After Jiang testified and returned home, he told a shoemaker named Zhou at the entrance of the alley that it was actually Jiang who pulled the bell, and the trolleybus started moving forward, causing the deceased to fall and be injured and die. He felt that the ticket seller had been wronged after seeing the news in the newspaper about the ticket seller pushing someone to death, so he came forward to testify. The police now request the court to pay special attention to the witness Yan Defa, because Yan may have been instructed by someone to protect the defendant and act as a perjurer.</p>
<p>Still Trying to Quibble</p>
<p>When questioned, the defendant Wang Wanxiang testified that when the deceased arrived at the Tongfu Road station, he wanted to get off the bus. I sold him a ticket, and the deceased asked me to give him the ticket first and then pay the fare. I refused because the company's regulations did not allow this. At that time, the deceased pulled the bell, and the bus started moving forward. The deceased wanted to avoid paying the fare and jumped off the bus, causing him to fall and be injured and die. I did not push him, etc. Subsequently, the witness Xu Shenjin voluntarily testified that he was a student at Nanjing Middle School. At 1:30 PM that afternoon, I boarded the No. 20 trolleybus at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road. When I had just stepped onto the step, the deceased was standing next to me, and the witness Jiang Jing was sitting at the entrance. Later, the deceased did not get the ticket for the two jiao fare he had paid, so he demanded it from the defendant. The defendant ignored him and rang the bell twice, and the bus started moving forward. The iron door was not closed, and the deceased wanted to pull the bell to stop the bus, but the defendant pushed his hand against the deceased's chest. Because the deceased had nothing to grab onto, he grabbed my left arm, causing me to fall at the same time and lose consciousness, etc.</p>
<p>Intimidating Witnesses</p>
<p>According to the witness Jiang Jing's testimony, his statement was the same as last time. But according to Jiang, after this case occurred, many people came to my house. Because I was not home, they intimidated my mother, insisting that I change my testimony. Because my environment is not good, I dare not stay at home. I would like to state to the court that. According to the witness Yan Defa, he is from Nanxiang and sells Cifan. He lives with Jiang Jing at No. 3 Fulai Lane, Dagu Road. After the last hearing in this case, Jiang went home and inadvertently mentioned to me that the testimony he gave in court was not true.</p>
<p>Actually Committing Perjury</p>
<p>At that time, Jiang actually pulled the bell to start the bus, causing the deceased to fall and die. And I saw this news in the newspaper on the 16th, and I knew that the defendant had been wronged, so I told Zhou Zhijiu, a shoemaker at the entrance of the alley. Unexpectedly, it was heard by the ticket seller of No. 241 and reported to the trolleybus company, inviting me to testify in court, etc. This witness made a large-scale attack on Jiang Jing. Subsequently, the court threw down Yan's written statement and asked Yan to read it aloud. He stuttered and could not read a complete sentence. Jiang Jing immediately stated to the court that the sections mentioned by Yan were not true. I would never lie to my own mother, and it makes no sense to tell the truth to someone who is not related to me at all. Yan has always behaved improperly, and my mother has repeatedly asked him to move out, holding a grudge in his heart, and he is actually here to commit perjury, etc.</p>
<p>Strictly Handled According to Law</p>
<p>The court clarified the facts and ordered the debate to begin. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that according to the testimony of the various witnesses, the crime of murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law could not be applied because it could not be proven that the defendant had intentionally committed murder. Please convict the defendant according to Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for the crime of causing death by injury. The defendant's behavior is heinous, his methods are vicious, and he is unforgivable under the law. Moreover, since this case occurred, it has aroused public outrage in society, and public opinion is in an uproar, disapproving of the defendant's actions. If he is not strictly handled according to law, it may affect the safety of the lives of all passengers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Perjury Arrested</p>
<p>This case was adjourned. The police deeply know that Your Honorable Court has received many letters from people with quite high social status, such as the principal of a certain school, Xi Zheru, and Cai Caijin, etc. The circumstances mentioned in their letters are largely consistent with the statements of the witnesses Jiang and Xu. Now the police request the court to impose the maximum penalty of life imprisonment according to Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. At the end of the debate by the defendant's lawyer Li Gengxiang and the lawyer Jiang Pingfan hired by the family of the deceased, the court ordered the defendant to be detained for sentencing on the morning of the 26th. The witness Yan Defa is suspected of perjury and was ordered to be detained and transferred to the Procuratorate of this court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Five Arrested in the French Concession</h3>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read in your newspaper's local news section about the bombing incident at the Jinling Restaurant yesterday, it was stated that Chen Guanghai (mistakenly written as Guangqing in the report) opened the Datong Restaurant, which led to bomb threats, etc. After investigation, the business is operated as a partnership. Mr. Chen is only a small shareholder in the restaurant. The information in your report does not align with the facts. We hereby request a correction and the publication of this letter in full to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Datong Restaurant</p>

The young man is handsome, but both matches against Corassa and Li were exceptionally difficult to win. Therefore, whether he can win against the experienced Wang Wenzheng depends on whether Xu can make an effort. Tickets are priced at one yuan and one jiao.

<h3>Handicap Basketball Facing More Twists; Tongren Lodges Protest; Second Final Postponed Today</h3>
<p>The Handicap Basketball Championship Week began last week. The second game between Shanghai Star and Tongren, originally scheduled to be held today, has been protested by Tongren, citing that Shanghai Star used Lin Manli (No. 3), a Jinan player, in the first championship final last week. According to the rule that the same player cannot participate in the same championship representing different teams, an investigation should be conducted. However, Shanghai Star has not admitted that Lin Manli is a Jinan player, stating that the Jinan player is Lin Wanli, and that Lin Manli is his brother. Manli has never participated for Jinan. Therefore, the competition authorities must examine the issue of Lin Manli's team affiliation before the second final scheduled for today is postponed for careful review.</p>

<h3>How to Study Today's Chinese Geography</h3>
<p>— Tan Lian</p>
<p>Now that foreign troops have invaded our country's territory, part of our border has been destroyed, and the integrity of the entire border cannot be guaranteed. However, a country's border cannot remain vague for long. After the military situation has calmed down, it must be reorganized first. Without some study, there will be no standards and we will lose our autonomy. Our country's southwestern border, such as the undetermined southern section of the Yunnan-Myanmar border, was resurveyed by both sides' personnel in the years 1935, 1936, and 1937, and most of it has already been determined. It is said that during this boundary survey, Banghong Mengsuo was allowed to belong to us, and the report has been drafted. It only needs to be announced by both governments, but the Lugouqiao Incident interrupted it. Recently, the construction of the Yunnan-Burma Railway requires a determination of the border because China and Myanmar must be connected. It is hoped that this may provide an opportunity to resolve the outstanding issues. (Now both sides have formally announced it). The undetermined northern section of the China-Myanmar border has not been resolved due to long-standing disputes over Pianma Jiangxinpo. Britain has built roads from Myitkyina to Pianma and Gongbulabang, infringing on our country's sovereignty. The western Pamirs, known as jointly owned by China, Britain, and Russia, have not had their boundaries delineated and most of them have been invaded. The southernmost border is Zengmu Shoal in the Tuansha Islands. I have repeatedly published articles in newspapers and printed special maps, calling on the people of our country to pay attention. For many years, various published maps have not been corrected, and readers have not expressed any opinions, indicating that people in the country do not pay much attention to borders, which is a very serious problem and should be studied constantly.</p>
<p>Land routes (railways and highways) and waterways (shipping routes) are all helpful for wartime transportation. In addition to the most important Yunnan-Burma Road, which is attracting attention from both China and abroad, there is also a highway from Yuexu in Guangxi to Chehe. After it was built, it was originally intended to connect to Vietnam and serve as an international thoroughfare, but unfortunately it was blocked along with the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway due to the events in Vietnam. Other newly built roads include Xichang to Leshan and Daheba to Yushu. The Yushu route to the south originally had a planned line to Xikang, but after resurveying, the terrain was found to be too steep and difficult to drive on. A safer route needs to be found before construction can begin. Reports indicate that the Sichuan-Kang to Burma Highway has recently opened to traffic, but because the starting and ending points are not specified, the true situation is unclear. There is also the highway from Xichang to Xiangyun.</p>

<h3>A Cafeteria That Makes Student Cafeterias</h3>
<p>— Guo Hongdi</p>
<p>After tasting the economical meals at the student cafeteria of the Sichuan Road YMCA and looking at the menu and ingredient list of the meat dishes of the day, I began to feel that there are many aspects of our daily lives that can be changed to be more rational and scientific.</p>
<p>This student cafeteria, co-sponsored by the YMCA, can be said to have achieved its proclaimed three principles of "economy, hygiene, and nutrition." The day's menu includes six varieties: stir-fried pork liver with potatoes, stir-fried pork with kelp and daylily, braised yellow croaker with tofu, stir-fried beef strips with onions, stir-fried greens, and tomato vegetable soup. The dishes are all approved by experts and are nutritious and fairly delicious. The layout of the cafeteria, while not luxurious, is undeniably clean. To eat such a nutritious meal in such a place costs only 1.40 yuan (1.20 yuan for students, and only 7 jiao for poor students). Where else in Shanghai can you find such a deal today? The method of automatically taking a bowl to fill with rice in the cafeteria is also worth promoting.</p>
<p>I am not trying to advertise for this student cafeteria, but after eating a meal there, I feel that schools can also emulate their relatively scientific methods. In addition, students from nearby schools, or office workers from non-student companies and stores, even if they do not necessarily want to be long-term diners, may want to try this home-style meal. Although this cafeteria is called "Student," the diners are not limited to students.</p>
<p>Parents, please take your children there once, so they can know that they can also carry dishes and serve rice themselves; if convenient, please have your servants eat there too, so they can know that the kitchen and dining room do not necessarily have to be covered in dust and swarming with flies.</p>

<h3>Domestic Scandal Discourse</h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>It seems this has been going on for a long time: "Domestic scandals" are not allowed to be publicized. Unfortunately, such so-called "domestic scandals" are always more widely spread the more they are concealed, and in the end, they cannot avoid making a fool of themselves. Here, another idiom seems very fitting: "If you don't want people to know, the best thing is not to do it."</p>
<p>However, "not doing it" goes against the original intention of those who advocate "domestic scandals should not be publicized." Their philosophy: If I do something bad, you are not allowed to announce it for me; criticism and opposition are even more deserving of death.</p>
<p>Thus, on the one hand, they try their best to create "domestic scandals," and on the other hand, they prohibit publicizing them, leading to more and more scandals, and things getting worse and worse. However, the living facts are right in front of everyone. Even with the cleverest tricks, one hand can never cover the eyes and ears of everyone; as a result, they only see their efforts becoming more and more futile, wasting their efforts in vain. There is no shortage of precedents for this in history.</p>
<p>Now, the issue of "domestic scandals" is once again on the table, and there are clearly two different views on it. Because the crux of the matter lies in the conspiracies, friction, oppression, framing, corruption, hoarding, debauchery, and so on, of a few people with ulterior motives in the country, this scandal also concerns all the people of China.</p>
<p>One side, which advocates that domestic scandals should not be publicized, sarcastically says that domestic scandals can only be covered up, not publicized, so as not to give others an excuse for propaganda. Therefore, for all the facts that are indeed ugly, even if they are obvious to everyone and cannot be concealed, they must flatly deny them or distort the facts to defend them, in order to carry out their purpose of "even a leper's son is good to his own eyes." The other side believes that if family members have committed ugly deeds, they should be thoroughly investigated and this kind of ugly deed should be completely eradicated; we should not indulge and condone them for fear that others will have an excuse, but instead let these black sheep be free and at ease, and then become even bolder and more reckless, doing all kinds of evil, making the entire "family" uneasy, and even moving towards collapse.</p>
<p>These two views are absolutely contradictory, and their starting points are undoubtedly to safeguard their motherland. Because the issue itself concerns all the people of our country, we should follow the most correct path to solve it, so as not to cause harm to the people of the whole country.</p>
<p>Now, the preliminary question is not whether domestic scandals should be publicized or not, but whether there is a determination to eliminate domestic scandals. Just as a boil grows on the body, it must be cut off quickly in order to preserve the remaining good parts; if you are afraid of exposing the boil to be ridiculed or attacked by others, and instead conceal the illness and avoid treatment, what will be the result? I am afraid that it will be too late to regret when the disease has penetrated deep into the bone marrow. Even if a leper wears a hat all year round, it will eventually be difficult to avoid the embarrassment of being exposed. The only way is to use insecticide to kill the germs that multiply on the scalp; covering it with a hat is useless.</p>
<p>For the same reason, concealing and protecting the crimes of a few privileged classes will only fuel their poisonous flames and increase the suffering of the vast majority of people; moreover, the impact is not only on everyone's face, but on the survival of the entire country.</p>
<p>Indulgence is enough to foster wickedness, and nurturing a boil will eventually cause trouble. Friends who truly love their "home," let us concentrate our efforts to expose and eradicate all the ugly dregs hidden in the corners of the house!</p>
<h3>Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Laborious Mind</p>
<p>I have things I love. I love the fireflies that light up the dark night, the moths that fly towards the light.</p>
<p>I also have things I hate. I hate the pampered, haughty lapdogs, the pigs with fat brains and full intestines.</p>
<p>Don't think that all bowing is obedience. Don't you see that anger is burning in the eyes of the majority?</p>
<p>Death is tragic, but unnatural death is even more tragic. From the day I witnessed an unnatural death, I decided to devote my life to stopping this kind of death.</p>

<h3>Firefighters Playing Blind</h3>
<p>— Kezhong</p>
<p>The person in the picture reaching out and groping is not playing a game of hide-and-seek, but is a type of training London firefighters receive. Besides the full set of firefighting gear and steel helmets, they also wear gas masks. Because when a city is bombed and catches fire, they must go in and out of thick smoke and flames, and their eyes cannot be opened. Even if they are opened, they probably won't see anything except the raging flames. Therefore, when fighting fires, they cannot help but grope forward like a blind person. When they train, they tie up their eyes, listen to the commands of the training officer, and grope step by step, acting as temporary blind people.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Twelve: Unexpected Turmoil</p>
<p>Seeing that it was about to get dark, his shadow still didn't know where it was; this situation was rather strange, because in this Zhangshu Village, except for the Wu family, Yu Kun had no other acquaintances, and there was nothing fun to do in the village. If he didn't go back to Beiping, where had he been all this time?</p>
<p>In fact, it was not until after the lamps were lit that he rushed back in a daze.</p>
<p>"Third brother, things are looking promising!" As soon as he entered the room, he squatted in front of the begonia pot and said in a very low voice. He looked very excited. "Tonight I have to go out again. If you hear any noise in the Meng family's old store across the street later, don't go out to see. Remember! You must tell Xiao Gouzi's brothers not to go out, just pretend you didn't hear anything. I won't be back tonight..."</p>
<p>He swallowed his saliva, not giving Begonia a chance to ask, and continued to say hurriedly:</p>
<p>"If the Meng family asks you anything tomorrow, deny everything and pretend you don't know. Let them be confused for a day, and I'll come back the day after tomorrow to tell you how to deal with them..."</p>
<p>"Ah! Second brother, what are you planning to do? Don't cause trouble that can't be cleaned up!" Begonia asked worriedly, fearing that Yu Kun would cause some big trouble. (218)</p>

<h3>Standard Little Thing Wang Wei</h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>Wang Wei is the daughter of Wang Xianzhai, a comedian. Her original name was Wang Fangxuan. She is nineteen years old this year and is from Donghuang County. She studied at Minzhi Primary and Secondary School and Shanghai Girls' High School. She was very diligent in her studies and always ranked at the top of her class.</p>
<p>She started acting after August 13th. At that time, Mei Xi, Zhou Chu, and others organized a middle school student united drama troupe (later renamed Yixing), and advertised for male and female members. She hid it from her father and her classmates, and registered with the name Wang Wei. She was accepted on the spot because she spoke fluent Mandarin and her movements and expressions showed innocence and liveliness.</p>
<p>Her first play was "People of Pleasure," directed by Ge Ge. She was assigned to play the role of a little girl and played it very well. Then, she starred in "Di Siniang." At this time, Wang Xianzhai realized that his daughter was honing her art.</p>
<p>It was Zhou Chu who told him:</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang, your daughter is acting in the troupe!"</p>
<p>"What? She joined the troupe outside without telling me?" Gan Xianzhai was surprised and happy.</p>
<p>When Wang Wei came home, she saw her father's stern face. However, soon, Wang Xianzhai changed to a gentle expression and said,</p>
<p>"Fangxuan, since you like acting, then work hard!"</p>

<h3>"Family" Movie Story (1)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yibai</p>
<p>Amidst the sound of firecrackers, the courtyard door of the mansion was replaced with new peach charms, and many people were busy. The hall was brightly lit with candles, and all the furnishings showed the style of a large family. Gao Juexin, who occupied the position of the eldest grandson, seemed to be carrying a great responsibility at this time, running back and forth in the rooms of each of his family members non-stop. Because the highest authority in this house was his grandfather, the old master Gao, who had been a prominent official. He usually valued etiquette the most, especially on this New Year's Eve, so everyone in this house had to say goodbye to the old master.</p>
<p>Zhang Gu, the old master Gao's daughter, also brought her beloved daughter, Zhang Yunhua, back. The hall was filled with the joy of the New Year, and the normal New Year's Eve etiquette was about to begin. Juexin looked around the room, but his two younger brothers, Juemin and Juemin, were missing. It was raining and snowing outside, and he didn't know how his two younger brothers hadn't returned yet. After much searching, Juemin and Juehui finally arrived at the door slowly, sharing an umbrella. They were talking very enthusiastically along the way, as if they had forgotten that it was New Year's Eve. The picture shows old master Gao and concubine Chen saying goodbye to the ancestors in the ancestral hall.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Qiong Flowers</h3>

<p>Chapter 17: A Crown's Worth of Anger for a Beauty</p>
<p>Wu Sangui listened to his father's words, which were justified and irrefutable. Taking advantage of the situation at this time to seize the beautiful concubine from the family of the emperor's relatives, indulging in pleasure, and neglecting military affairs would surely offend the emperor if he knew about it, right? Thinking like this, he felt a little timid and did not dare to take Yuanyuan with him. He listened to his father's words and left Yuanyuan in his father's residence, entrusting his father to take care of her. But how could Yuanyuan have expected Wu Sangui's promise to change again? When Wu Sangui walked into the room, he suddenly changed his mind and told her that he was afraid of offending someone. Yuanyuan's eyebrows furrowed instantly, and she said in a sad voice, "You promised me to go together so nicely, but now you've changed your mind again. Leaving me alone here is so lonely. Isn't being a husband and wife for one night just adding to my endless longing and thousands of strands of sorrow?" Wu Sangui thought Yuanyuan's words were ominous, so he comforted her by saying, "It's also because I have no choice but to do so. Please don't resent me. You must know that I love you very much in my heart. Who would be willing to leave you behind and travel far away? Please forgive me for this. Besides, I will be back soon, and the days when I will be reunited with you in the future will be long. I hope the flowers will always be in full bloom, and the moon will always be round. Why do you insist on saying that we are husband and wife for only one night? You are a smart girl, with a delicate and exquisite heart, so you must be able to understand everything. I can't think of any other words to comfort you. In short, we will be able to see each other again soon, so why be sad about this short separation?" Yuanyuan nodded after hearing Wu Sangui's words and said, "What you said is not unreasonable, but it's just that we've been too hasty, leaving me alone with a lonely lamp and shadow. How can I bear it?" Wu Sangui said a lot more nice things, but Yuanyuan was always unhappy, afraid to hear the parting song. However, Wu Sangui had to put aside his personal feelings for the sake of military and state affairs. In the end, he had to say goodbye to Yuanyuan and embark on the journey, rushing day and night to leave the pass to mobilize troops and prepare to serve the emperor.</p>
