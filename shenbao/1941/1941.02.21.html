<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際局勢何嘗緩和</h3>
<p>或以爲國際局勢近日緩和了些，這一印象未必準確吧。論局勢，遠些自一九三一年的九一八說起，近些自一九三九年八月底說起，每一分鐘皆在漸趨惡化之中，直至今日幷今日以後，方繼績惡化，絕未中止，更何嘗改善絲毫；至於空氣的或覺緊張，或覺緩和，僅是把握不着局勢重心者追隨了表面浮動的心理反應，並非繼續惡化中的國際局勢有何轉變。即如數日前的恐慌，與近日的寬慰，皆是過度。</p>
<p>近日何以或以爲緩和？在歐洲方面：土耳其與保加利亞協定。祗是國際局勢演變過程中的枝節，不足以防止巴爾幹戰禍的可能延擴；更從另一角度觀察，雖視爲佈種了惡化的另一伏因，亦無不可。總之，世界局勢以歐局爲極重要的一環，歐局旣已開展如現狀，即使由萬一的意外機會而調停息爭，至多亦不過使戰爭「中止」若干歲月而並非戰爭的「終止」；况調停並無萬一成功之望，一切有待決定於英德兩國的決戰。認淸了這一點，可知表面容有一時張弛，却無關根本。</p>
<p>在太平洋方面：中日交戰已經到了第五個年頭，前綫或膠着，或活潑，事實是全面滯留於交戰狀態。當前的趨勢又蔓延至中日兩國範疇之外，這以日本的南進爲中心而觸及了法屬越南泰國荷屬東印以及英美與澳洲聯邦。數日前的恐慌，由於日本南進的劍拔弩張，日當局一再表示貫澈其策略，務必實現所謂共榮圈，不顧一切抗議，不顧一切反對云云；不但如此表示，凡彼作爲，皆屬顯然爲逐步實行南進的佈局；因此徵候，使英美荷澳不得不取聯合對抗的準備與行動，於是一般人覺得那方面將有一觸即發的新戰禍，而其氣勢又似岌岌不可終日。近日情况，初無足資寬慰的理由；大的祗因爲日方口吻軟了；如外相松岡謂日本並不擬作東亞共榮圈內一切人民的領導，僅自信有領導的力量而已；又如外决大橋謂政府不欲以武力完成其目的，僅願以談判方式覓致解決；又如駐英大使重光向英國外决勃特勒口頭保證日本並無攻擊太平洋中英屬領的意嚮；又如駐美大使野村亦謂美日戰爭可以避免云云；此外，日人復在東京與倫敦兩地提議，願作歐戰調人，此殆希特勒所頤使的作爲，是其慣用的和平攻擊中之一貌，而美國衆議員法狄斯已立即譏誚之曰「日本手上華人之鮮血未乾，竟思進一步以全世界之進行和平人自居一，然日人於此時而作此提議，亦自可與其他軟了的口吻相呼應，相襯託；因此種種，或認爲緩和。假使世人確信爲局勢緩和了些，則無疑其爲日方麻醉手術的絕大成功，亦係假借「時間」的絕大成功；而美國除於實際事功進行不懈，如推進援助法案，軍艦西遣，關島設防之外，國務副卿對日方言辭復作無情之揭破曰「處今日世界極端嚴重之局勢中，美府政對於他國之行動較其發言人所發之聲明更感興趣」，這是一語破的之談。甘言無益，緩和安在？推其意，要在鬆懈了各方人心，可能的使英美荷澳方面的對抗準備與行動趨於稽延，然後等待彼所期望的環境之來臨，攫取實現其南進之最有利的時機而己。總之，太平洋的安危關鍵，繫於日本在事實與行動上是否糾正其侵華與南進的侵略；這與歐局與整個國際大局，雖相關聯，却自成一環；無論歐局如何，世局如何，關鍵總是在此。關鍵一日不解脫，危機一日不消弭，而日本則至今絕無糾正其侵略策略的朕兆，且顯然的正在待機而動，然則安得有所謂緩和？太平洋局勢開展如現狀，所剩餘的岐途，一是在中日戰爭的方式與範圍之內，以中國的正面作戰，美國等的厚援，逼使日本由失敗而回頭；一是留待作戰於西太平洋，然後逼使日本回頭；岐途的決定，却與歐洲的英德決戰有莫大關係。若美國熊度的賢明堅强，而不再進一步採行直接而積極的手段，則無論侵略者的口吻如何軟些，至多使他暫時徘徊於上述的岐途，仍無望於恢復太平洋的太平。</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（卅）（六）</p>
<h3>英軍官西綫日記</h3>
<p>下午四時：蒙脫狄第和貢比　都已淪陷。</p>
<p>下午六時：敵軍進佔福茂利和格蘭維利，謠傳先頭部隊已到波維斯和邦托斯，離巴黎西北抵二十哩了。</p>
<p>六月九日上午九時四十五分：昨天午後，局勢轉變得很快。德軍以機械化部隊為前鋒，在里姆以北大舉進攻，已經趙過愛納河急進，英法空軍將以全力阻止敵軍戰車隊活動。這次進攻也許是大包圍的開始。德軍想深入法國到維亞河為止，然後不管法國的政府，而逕向法國人民講和。</p>
<p>六月十日：橋　都埋了炸藥，預備炸毀。照例國人的破壞精神很不夠，常常祗炸毀近岸的幾個橋洞，修稪起來非常容易。這裹的羅亞河有好幾百碼闊，我想如果法軍陣綫崩潰，仍想繼續抵抗的話，羅亞河是最後的一道防綫了。</p>
<p>六月十二日上午十一時半：里姆南面德軍有三個生力軍團。昨天法軍司令部已撤退到梅恩，駐紮在鎮裹。現在海峽至蒙脫梅地一綫有德軍八十師。法軍祗有疲兵三十五師。法國已不再有轉敗為勝的希望了。</p>
<p>十二時十分：淪陷區中法軍已撤退三分之一，由此更可證實法軍軍心渙散的傳說。據估計，法軍中有一半士兵的家鄉都在淪陷區。</p>
<p>下午十一時：今晚又收到極不好的消息，賽納河陣地已被突破。</p>
<p>六月十三日上午十時四十分：一般人的意見都以為法軍就要總退却了。昨晚法軍某軍官對我說，「我們祇有三十五師。平時每師防地最長不過七公里，現在有幾師的防地却延長到三十公里。有些固然是精銳部隊，有些却不大可靠。德軍有八十師，設備都比我們好。你能怎麼樣呢？」</p>
<p>午夜十二時：據說成千成萬的法軍已拋下武器，逃到瑪爾納河南岸。法軍砲彈百分之六十都會爆炸，這已是公認的事實了。</p>
<p>英國空軍戰　機隊已定今晚飛往海岸。如果形勢不十分緊急，我們也許在明後大跟上去。</p>
<p>六月十四日：法軍昨夜已放棄巴黎，今天就要由德方第十四軍佔領了。雖然密雲大雨阻止了空軍的活動，但是從截獲的德方軍令看來，天氣一轉晴，就要大舉轟炸了。</p>
<p>十二時十五分：喬治將軍通告說，法軍就要退到羅亞河防綫，已決定放棄馬奇諾防綫了。這個報告是此次戰事的大關鍵。</p>
<p>下午三時五十九分：喬治將軍又通告說，「一切有組織的抵抗已完全終止了。」</p>
<p>六月十五日：昨日午後四時，和吳道爾奧斯鮑羅離奧林斯，經勒猛到安吉。勒猛是交通司令部所在地。我們去拜訪英軍司令勃羅克將軍。又去拜訪主持撤兵的海軍長官。他的名字好像是加拉特，是個嚴肅精明的人。我永遠忘不了他辦公廳裹的氣象。那辦公廳的房間在一所大厦裹，兩邊通着寬大的房間。傍晚很熱，室內工作着的七八個海軍官佐，都熱得捲起了衣袖。室內像死一樣地寂靜，除了偶或一二聲私語外，聽不到人說話。祗有用電話發令的時候，才聽到唯一的聲音。發令的聲音，簡明有力，不難使人知道他們的意向。室內的空氣像教堂裹一般，每個人都有他的事做，並且身心一致地在做。到辦公廳裹來的軍人，站在那裹，不論軍官小兵，都受到這種嚴肅空氣的感動。</p>
<p>除了我們道正待撤退的一萬二千人以外，大約法國境內還有英軍七萬五千人。</p>
<p>六月十六日：昨日忽忽忙忙地離了安吉。到機塲和一個機師說了幾句話回來，得悉德軍戰車離公路不過十四哩。空軍總指揮勸我到機塲等飛機全部飛出後，再到南德，吳道爾和奧斯鮑羅就和我立刻一同出發。</p>
<p>沿路風景很好。這一帶我從小時候，就很熟了，然而以前經過羅亞河却從沒有這麼早。河旁沙灘平闊，兩邊都是葡萄園，對我好像家一般地熱識。我們沿着河的南岸，經過每處村落和橋　時都有容貌果毅的老年鄉民阻住檢查。他們都帶着步槍，很能耐苦。他們佈好障礙物，預備阻止敵軍較輕的摩托部隊。雖然不能阻擋戰車的行進，然而機器脚踏車和軍用車是很可以阻止的。</p>
<p>下午到達南德以南的英國空軍戰　機隊司令部。情形混亂不堪。原定昨夜開始遷移，已遲了幾小時。各種物件都拋了一地。今天早晨這裹像個垃圾堆。草地上有官長們破碎了的制服，打字機，汽車，貨車，醫藥用品等等，隨地都是。</p>
<p>我們正等着出發，坐車還是乘飛機，看情形而定。</p>
<p>六月十七日上午十時十五分：今晨第一架偵察機帶來敵軍的真確消息。德軍已進入奧林斯，各處橋　都已炸斷，有些地方都起了火。奧林斯西南十二哩一座小橋右　，有十二架載車停着。這還不算什麼，然而戰車後面竟有幾輛難民車。德軍工程隊正在修理斷橋，德軍戰車和法國難民車都很忍耐地等着一同越過橋。</p>
<p>退至羅亞灣的軍事行動還沒有全部完畢。</p>
<p>天公使撤退受到不少便利。雷雨使對面都看不清楚。昨晚躱在機塲上一架勃侖漢機下面，雖則躱在那裹，可是　過機下的水，已幾乎把我冲掉了</p>
<p>昨夜一輛火車駛過。我軍高射砲隊某軍官在睡夢裹聽了，以為是德軍機械化部隊，立刻跳下床舖，却把脚趾的一節脫了骱。這是高射砲隊中第一個受傷的人。</p>
<p>正午十二時：得到法軍求和的消息。</p>
<p>五時半：陸上人員的最後一批已出發了。</p>
<p>五時五十分：空軍人員及空軍總指揮也乘機飛去。</p>
<p>五時五十五分：吳道爾，奧斯鮑羅和我，以及其他軍官三十人，分乘勃侖漢機五架自南德機塲出發。</p>
<p>午後八時：在英國海司頓降落。</p>
<p>後來知道，德軍機器脚踏車隊已於午夜領導着機械化部隊攻入南德。（完）</p>

<p>「清潔」的對面是污穢腐敗、「簡單」的對面是複雜繁瑣、「撲素」的對面是奢侈浮華、「迅速」的對面是遲鈍麻木、「確實」的對面是虛偽欺詐、這六大病根、如果能完全剗除、中國的建國工作便一日千里、正因為我們沒有實行全剗除道六大病根、所以到今天、前綫軍民雖後造成</p>
<p>英勇戰績</p>
<p>而我們全國的社會風氣、和個人生活、還不能推動抗建的成功、我認為上面所舉種種的缺點、表現在社會惡習上的、莫過於烟·賭·盜·娼·四件醜事、而表現在個人生活上的、莫過於奢、惰、貪、怯、四種劣性、我們只要想一想、日人在</p>
<p>淪陷區域</p>
<p>所獎勵的、無不是烟賭盜娼、就可以知道、這四者是戕賊我們民族生命的毒素、我們只要想一想、凡是奢侈的、懶惰的、貪污的、怯懦的、不賣國亦要誤國、就可以知道這四者是妨害我們抗建的最大的惡德、總括一句話、烟賭盜娼是社會生存的公敵、</p>
<p>奢惰貪污</p>
<p>是個人生活的大敵、我們若不能運用大勇大忍的精神、把這兩種內在的敵人、加以無情的　滅、那麼我們社會就無法生存、個人決不能自強自立、我們作戰到了今天、已有驅除外患、達到勝利的自信、但我們如果不把這兩種內在的敵人打倒、就是把日軍驅除了以後、我們的</p>
<p>國家民族</p>
<p>還依然沒有出路、甚且仍不免於次殖民地的悲運、試問這樣我們如何對得起革命先烈、如何對得起前綫軍民、如何對得起痛苦流離的同胞、所以我要求大家、切莫把　生活運動、當作一件與抗建無關係的事、要知道、這真是關係我們四萬萬五千萬人</p>
<p>生死存亡</p>
<p>千年萬世、運命所　的一件大事、我所以不憚反覆地說、就要我們同胞認識這一個意義、以十分的決心、一致力行新生活、以十分的熱情、來推動社會、實行新生活、現在是新生活運動的第八年開始、本人感到</p>
<p>過去工作</p>
<p>不够實在、也不够普遍、認為今後　更應特別着重新運工作的考核、我們應該依各省市新運分會、和各級機關、普遍執行考核、來評定各項成績的優劣、並且要分次分期經常舉行、用競賽獎懲的辦法、來策勵大家實行新生活、至於今後改造社會、轉移風氣的實際工作、我在今天特別要對我們同胞提出一列四點、希望共同注意、一致實行、第一是切實戒除賭博、賭博在各國是娛樂、似乎是不足為奇、但在我國實在是民族最大的羞辱、這不僅是國民隨落腐敗的象徵、也是民族道德最大的障碍、大家只要看同睅聚賭的人、他們因為</p>
<p>勝　利害</p>
<p>的不同、就是對家人親友、也都要變為面對面的重心鬥角、勢不兩立的敵人、有人批評中國賭風普遍的結果、造成了民族嫉妒恥恨的惡　、這話不為無因、所以賭博不但耗時耗財、而且有傷失民族同胞的情誼、為親愛精誠的最大孟賊、今後全國上下、務必痛切認識賭博和新時代民族親愛互助的不能相告、無論前方後方、家庭學校或機關、更應該互相勸阻、澈底根除、總要趁這個對作戰的時期、掃去我們普遍於</p>
<p>社會各層</p>
<p>的、這個最可恥痛的污點、第二是澈底肅清烟毒、禁烟拒毒、政府早已反覆申會、我在去年新運六週紀念日、　標揭「肅清烟毒、為主要工作之一、年終六年禁絕計劃滿期、又通電全國戒勉、目前在我們後方各省禁種禁運禁售禁吸、本已大體完成、但淪陷區域內大施其毒化政策、我們後方更應該痛切覺悟、共同來　除殘餘的烟毒、切莫因疏於防範、使得他死灰復然、乃至於前功盡棄、要知道在淪陷區內的同胞、就是你要決心戒烟、也不能讓你自由來戒了、這種真是求生不得、求死不能的慘痛、但是我們民族決不能束手待斃、所以我特別要勸勉淪陷區內的同胞、無論怎麼樣、我們需要對於烟毒、</p>
<p>疾惡如仇</p>
<p>立志戒除、誓死勿受誘惑、並且要以戒烟除毒、視為在戰塲上作戰一樣的重要、我們各級政府和領導人士、對於　除烟毒的餘燼、應當認為本年新運的中心工作、務必　澈法令、人民亦應互相　勉、協力檢舉、至於前方收復每一處失地以後、政軍當局、又當以澈底禁烟、為撫綏　革最先的　種要政、必須去掉這個最大的毒患、一切不合理的惡習、纔可　除、積極向上的精神、纔能發揮、（十八日電）　（未完）</p>

<p>方單案開審記</p>
<p>博良律師誤引詩經傳爲美談</p>
<p>華籍地主四人、控訴工部局徵收方單地稅一案、昨日下午二時三十分、領事法庭假工部局二樓會議室、繼續審理、出庭者有領事法庭秘書朗氏、原告方嘉平·胡經方·諸瑞清·方文德、辯護律師劉世芳·王健、工部局辯護律師博良·汝保彝、前後約歷二小時、至四時許始告退庭、該案決延期至下星期二（二十五日）繼續審理、</p>
<p>博良律師　誤引詩經</p>
<p>其實工部局辯護律師汝保彝、坐於證人席上、蓋汝爲上次開審時博良律師所請之證人、彼曾提出種種中國土地法律及大清律例作證、故昨日開審後、劉世芳律師亦對上次開審所述各點、予以痛詰、劉氏聲稱、上次被告辯護律師博良、曾引述中國古書孟子中一語「普天之下、莫非王土」、謂中國人民之土地、皆係向皇帝租借而來、人民並無土地所有權、故應繳納租稅、則不論方單地與道契地、依此例彼、實應向當局繳納租稅、此種言論、實屬誤解、蓋此語旣非孟子所言、而出於詩經、且在意義方面、亦飛言中國人民、並無土地所有權、僅為孟子當時、引述詩經、作爲憤激之表示而已、</p>
<p>道契方單　顯然有別</p>
<p>繼稱、（一）外人持有之道契地、註明係永租契、而華人所執之土地證、則註明由所有權字樣、即領事法庭於上次審理本案時、工部局方而之英文紀錄、亦已記明方單上、亦附註有所有權字樣、（二）博良所述藍道台於一八五五年二月二十四日告示中、有華人在租界區域內、租地造屋、需付租稅者、係指華人向私人租界地皮需付租金而言、並非謂向皇帝租得之土地、須付給租稅、亦與方單地需付租稅無關、而費唐法官竟將藍道台之向私人租地皮之距、誤譯爲地皮章程之租地而需納地稅者、</p>
<p>證明地保　係公務員</p>
<p>憶上次開庭時、汝保彝所稱、地保係屬不良之人、而非公務人員之一、但原告中諸瑞清之地保職務、確係土地局所委任、且有委任狀可作證明、即使工部局購置地產、亦須由地保捺印、方始生效、則可知其地位、並非如汝律師之所言、而汝律師又稱、根據大清律、方單地之移轉及繼承、均須登過戶、但大清律上、竟不知何處有此種載明、而實際上目下所有持有之方單、大都係清咸豐年間所發、因旣無新方單發出、於轉移及繼承時、自可無須作過戶登記手續、</p>
<h3>方單撇開　並不違法</h3>
<p>至汝律師稱、將方單割開、係屬違法、亦屬非是、查民國十七年上海市土地局年刋內、有業已割開之方單照片、下面並註明（此係撇單、人民於原單賣去一部份之地畝、即將該單截去一半或一角、交得主收執、以爲執業之證、當時劉律師並呈上上海特別市市政法規一本、並指出其中於民國十八年七月三日、核准上海特別市土地局發給執業證規則第六條、「凡舊田單已裁割或批分者、經查明核實後、分別坵號、」係方單可以分割之證明、</p>
<p>當劉律師當庭滔滔聲述時、工部局辯護律師博良、頻欲阻止其發言、但法官朗氏、則容許劉氏作繼續不絕之聲述、直至下午四時退庭之時、而汝保彝律師則自開庭至退庭、未曾有所答辯、</p>
<p>西僑主張　公平納稅</p>
<p>英僑李德爾昨致函字林西報、對工部局之現行徵稅制度、有所批評、略稱、工部局辯護律師博良、在領事法庭審理「方單地案」爲工部局辯護時、曾稱、納稅人爲社會利益計、應公平負担捐稅、並痛責「特權階級豁免租稅之非是、」工部局自不能容忍此數不公允之事實存在云云、博良之言、應用於方單地固極相宜、應用於業主自用地又何獨不宜、余以爲工部局改良稅制委員會、對此實應加以深切之注意焉、查方單案關係重大、倘工部局勝訴、則每年收入、可增多百萬元以上、</p>
<h3>少數美籍教士　準備返國</h3>

<h3>「儲備銀行滬行」　昨被人投炸彈　三人入內投四彈一彈爆炸　保鑣趙萬菊頭部中槍斃命</h3>
<p>昨日上午、公共租界外灘十五號「儲備銀行上海分行」內、突爲人投擲炸彈、共計四枚、僅一彈爆炸、投彈者且在梯畔開放手槍、致有保鑣一名、飲彈斃命、此外尚有僱員一名、被震碎之玻璃屑劃傷面部、茲將該案經過詳誌如後、</p>
<p>男子三人　沖入投彈</p>
<p>昨日午前十時十五分左右、突有中年男子三名、魚貫而入公共租界外灘十五號「儲備銀行上海分行」內、其中一衣西裝者、入內后即抽出手溜彈二枚、向內投擲、一墮於大門內右首甬道上未炸、一則墮在梯口、立時爆炸、致牆壁及玻璃炸毀多處、當時櫃內人員大驚、紛紛伏地、不敢稍動、</p>
<p>連開四槍　擊斃保鑣</p>
<p>同時尚有一男子逕登二樓、連投軍用手溜彈二枚、因藥綫閂子並未拔除、故落地未炸、該男子遂返身下樓、適與保鑣鎮江人趙萬菊（廿八歲）相値於梯畔、趙擬上前攔住去路、該男子乃拔出手槍向趙連開四槍、一彈當中趙之頭部、由太陽穴穿入腦際、另一彈則被擊中前胸、立時滾倒梯畔、</p>
<p>混亂之中　三人逸去</p>
<p>擲彈者會合後、即將兇器拋棄、於混亂中逸逃無蹤、旋駐於隔壁交通銀行內之日憲兵三十餘名亦出動警戒、同時警務處派遣之警備車及大隊中西探捕亦馳往出事地點、並將附近一帶斷絕交通、嚴加搜索、但未有所得、乃將保鑣趙萬菊送仁濟醫院、終因彈傷要害、　未及抵院、即告斃命、屍送騐屍所待騐、當炸彈一枚、在梯口爆炸時、玻璃窗均被震碎、致玻璃屑劃破僱員薛洪面部、但無大碍、現捕房已將該「行」男女職員一度傳訊、並將檢獲之手槍及未爆手溜彈携回檢騐、</p>
<h3>美甲蒙艦　昨晨返國</h3>
<p>此次泊滬時間　不足廿四小時</p>
<p>美海軍萬噸運輸艦甲蒙號、此行來滬、將其寄椗時間、減短至不足二十四小時、（此爲美運輸艦泊滬之最短時間、）已於昨日（二十日）清晨離浦江內英海軍浮筒、徐徐下駛、出口返美、在滬服務期滿之美海軍第四陸戰隊約一百零五人、均乘該艦返美國東西海岸各口岸、又駐平津兩地美陸戰隊約一百五十人在華北服務期屆者、與美國亞洲艦隊人員在東方服務已畢者、亦搭該艦而行、甲蒙號將取道馬尼刺·關島與檀香山駛返美國、查此前美運輸艦每次駛來亞洲、必灣泊上海兩次、第一次爲從馬尼刺駛往秦皇島途中、在吳淞口或上海小泊、以便所載人員登岸、然後循例前往秦皇島或青島與烟台、歸途中復在滬寄泊約十日、俾艦員登岸暢遊數日後、橫渡太平洋回美、惟此次甲蒙號不循此例、僅從馬尼刺直放秦皇島、歸途中於昨日午前八時抵滬小泊、</p>
<h3>洋米到埠愈湧　米價愈漲</h3>

<h3>公共租界現狀　應亟謀改進芻議（一）</h3>
<p>— 奈許</p>
<p>工部局代理副總辦奈許氏，服務該局已歷二十五年，近已向局方辭職，離滬在即，特本其過去之經騐，並盱衛最近局勢，以私人資格，發表「上海公共租界應亟謀改進芻議」一文，爲「費唐報告」後之名著。茲由大中通訊社譯成，特分段刋載於次。奈許氏將於本月二十五日離滬回國，吾人於其臨別之諍言，表示無限敬佩。敬祝奈許君前途幸福。</p>
<p>余雖主張重視公共租界內各國主權之力量及其準確歷史之估計，但公共租界當前之幸福，是基於市政政策之獨立，而脫離有關係各國之國家政策。此言也，初聞之似爲自向矛盾之論。</p>
<p>十年寗靜</p>
<p>溯自一八四〇年中國在軍事與政治上爲英國所敗，而設立英人居留地以迄於第一次世界大戰，起見公共租界之最大權力，操於英美兩國之手。自一九一四年至一九二五年，英國於歐戰之餘，原氣未復，對於公共租界之統治權，稍稍示弱，同時日本在西太平洋之海軍勢力，因當時歐戰之機會而愈形膨脹，其在中國之政治勢力，亦因而增大。美國則一秉自由黨與孤立派之政策，力圖緩和日本之勢力，而以維持現狀爲目的，一如一九二二年華盛頓條約及在華之幣原（Shidehara）所答報之自由政策所示者。凡此種種，均使公共租界之統治權，有所改觀。自一九一四年至一九二五年，英國戰後之疲憊，美國之漠不關心，日本之默許，與中國之無力，足以說明在華各國政策之交互作用，而以上海公共租界爲焦點，此種政策，彼此抵銷，保持均勢，卒使吾人之市政生活，獲得十年之寗靜。</p>
<p>合法願望</p>
<p>中國在上海公共租界市政生活之無權無力，至一九二五年告一段落，而代以國民革命之勢力，堅持公共租界爲中國領土之一部份，而其市政生活，必須合於中國民族願望與發言，不能使華人常處於被動之地位。嗣後五年，英美在華政策之趨向，尤其在上海公共租界者，正如張伯倫於一九二六年聖誕備忘錄中所言，不斷對中國合法之願望讓步。在公共租界內，此種願望，與傳統之市政政策及習慣，並不相合，而費唐法官所提之方式，乃欲使此種不相合之情形，譯爲未來和諧之中外關係，經「過渡時代」而終於「交還租界」之時期。</p>
<p>費唐報告</p>
<p>上海公共租界英美僑民在一九二五年至一九三〇年間所認爲「荒謬絕倫」之事，不圖竟成爲英美兩政府在華政策之歷史的事實，而費唐報告所提關於改良上海公共租界之建議，即以此種政策爲工具，將以前被認爲有關中國衰弱之洋涇浜地皮章程，加以修改，而使中國在公共租界市政生活目標與市政政策各方面，具有逐漸增多而最後成爲超越之勢力。在上海之外僑，雖表示不妥協之態度，但英美兩政府實際上已擬定此種政策。各該政府承認一九二八年在南京成立之國民政府，爲中國進步之政府，與英美兩國已發生最熱誠之政治與商業關係，如此政府，除預備取消領事裁判權之條約後，應使其在公民租界內之中國公民，享有投票權，並爲公平計，公共租界之市政生活，應以華人佔得最大之勢力。</p>
<p>不同政策</p>
<p>此即英美之政策，而此種政策適與日本之帝國政策，大相逕庭。日本對於中國民族願望之合法性，認爲尚未至其時，日本之軍事力量，由於世界大戰之機會，大見增高。上海公共租界一部份外僑以爲日本在華之目的，與英美之目的相同，其實大誤。由基本上言之，日本欲使英美在遠東屈服於日本勢力之下，同時使中國亦如此。日本與中國在亞洲爲兄弟之邦，而日本隱然以大阿哥自居，日本對中國之稱兄道弟，其用意在於使歐美在東亞無立足之地。日本一面願見中國強盛，以便助其排除歐美，但一面又不願中國過於強盛，以免日本自己亦在被排除之列。</p>
<p>日本遷就</p>
<p>自一九二三年華盛頓條約至一九三一年日軍侵犯中國東北，在此十年內，日本之遷就，乃爲暫時之態度，其實足以代表日本在華之外交政策者爲田中之「積極」行動，而非幣原消極之默許也。日本在華盛頓條約內，對英美海軍在西太平洋及中國沿海保持均勢之現狀，雖作讓步，但亦不足以代表日本對外政策之眞正的精神。欲知日本對外政策之眞面目，可於下述一事見之；即當時日本乘歐西各國正從事於大戰之際，日本向中國提出「廿一條」要求，意圖一次吞滅中國。</p>
<p>排斥歐西</p>
<p>余在此應插入一言，即本文之目的，並非在於譴責日本或任何一國之外交政策，余僅以客觀之事實，說明日本雙重目標之必然性，即日本欲在其「地理之範圍內」，一面控制中國；而另一面排除歐西各國之勢力。故日本雖任令列強對中國之合法願望讓步，而自認爲中立與合理，但其對於自身所扮演之角色，則另眼相看。因此，在此中國優秀份子所薈集之上海公共租界，日本目覩英美統治之地位，漸向中國民衆之勢力作不斷之進步，未免心有所忌，以爲中國之勢力，將駕日本而上位。爲進行其同時減弱列強勢力與中國勢力之變重目標起見，日本當時對於英美政策對中國之寬容主義，大事指責，以爲此種政策，有違公共租界之傳統政策。（未完）</p>

<p>美匯稍有上下</p>

<h3>金市欲高又挫　現貨抬四百元左右</h3>
<p>烚赤暗盤、使買進者興緻更淡、以晨初漲風已達六千一百七十元、但嗣後一途向下、恒徘徊於六告兇與六千一百元之間、目每有重入六千元大關之虞、晨初　上日收市後塲外甚昂、故開盤即告六千元高價後、忽因「儲備分行」被投彈而引起人心疲落、公和·成記·德　等力售、退至六千零二十元、惟盤至午收尚有六千零八十二元、後市一度為浮多硬抬至六千一百元、終以外匯續長、新豐永·仁承永·明豐等來出時、又挫達六千零十元、收盤結果為六千零三十五元、比上日計小五十元、又現貨行市、上午做開、此期貨好四百二十元、午後聞三百八十元曾有成交、全日期交約一萬餘兩、銀樓飾金終則平定、關金等平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌五十元</p>
<p>晨初上日晚收後、塲外堅持、各方雖無做多心思、而賣出已告歇手、故開盤遂告六千一百二十元、比上日做高三十五元、開後檯面頗形活潑、搶購甚猛、勢續上挺、曾達六千一百七十元、嗣以上述事件傳至、人心無形鬆懈、認為利賣、一時一片賣聲、如公和·成記·德孚等塞出最夥、雖其他銀號　有吸收、終因衆寡不敵、步落至六千零二十元、當時又慮有　入六千元大關之可能、賴大豐·合盛等力購、挽住跌風、回升至六千一百元、惟銀號幫又傾向售出、同康永等來賣、復盤跌至六千零三十五元、斯時大豐·恒記等突懷買意、乘賤搜納、被拉起四五十元、收盤前達六千零九十元、結果則告六千零八十二元、午後限價賣戶甚夥、故撳至六千零五十元、惟浮多硬扳、如合盛·益大·同康永等均願購入、捧至六千一百元、奈外匯報長、賣風因此陡盛、新豐永·仁承永·明豐·大售、竟跌達六千零十元、良以散戶拉住、收盤尚　至六千零三十五元、比上日軋小五十元、全日上落一百六十元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤（現貨）高十餘元、收進低四十元、現標金照掛牌低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>外幣需要尚殷</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價雖疲然英美金鎊則因現金價高關係故尚漲三元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票始曾要至十七元五角半、卒為十七元三角半、比上日軋跌一角、香港票供給旺盛、市價疲落、新加坡票、及安南·羅比·菲列濱票等、均有需要、市價一致挻漲、日金票及朝鮮票供求相埒、市價站平、前者仍站一元七角四分原盤、後者仍為一元三角五分、</p>
<h3>油市　油餅操縱　頗多曲折</h3>
<p>昨日油餅市况、依然不脫投機範圍、但其興奮狀態、略見减縮、不過一日間之趨勢、頗多曲折、先前行市在喊聲緊張之情形下、一浪高過一浪、入後賣風轉盛、又是回跌之勢、總之發國難財者都取入手為財之旨、故其變幻益高深、昨結果現豆油微升二角半、　油漲半元、花生油獨小二元、由香港幫辦去膠州一千二百件、價為一百零五元、豆油祗做開大連現油一百八十桶、期油七八百桶、豆餅內地香港幫辦去現餅五千餘片、其他期餅共成交四萬片左右、市價比上日趨升一角至二角外　二十一日出口豆子五百五十五包運厦門、又一千零二十五包運香港、又三千四百四十包運新加坡、豆餅六千塊運厦門、又一千八百塊運香港、花生一百包運新加坡、蔴油三百十聽運厦門、又六百三十聽運香港、</p>
<h3>南北貨　雜路枝疲弱</h3>
<p>雜路荔枝干邇來到貨雖稀、但市上存底尚　不薄、因此趨勢甚弱、兼之各幫去化至狹、更難轉振、故最近行盤降去五元至十元之譜、僅杭屬銷路較為活動、</p>
<h3>金雞納樹</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>金雞納樹Le　Quinqui斯山上的一種高約七八丈的常　喬木。它的葉作卵形，對生，有光澤，開白色的小花，冠作管形，成圓錐花序。在它的樹此裹面，含着一種白色針狀結晶，其味極苦，而治瘧疾有特效的植物　類，這就是藥名稱作金雞納「霜」的由來。至於金雞納的名字，是南美洲土人的稱呼，本義是「皮中之皮」。它的拉丁學名叫　Cinchona，是從秘魯總督的妻子　Cinchone伯爵夫人的名字來的。原來伯爵夫人於十七世紀初年在秘魯身染瘧疾：她聽了那蘇會神父的勸告，服了那所謂「耶蘇會修士藥粉」的，纔豁然痊愈，這種藥粉就是金雞納樹皮造的。伯爵夫人於一六三二年回國，——當然是西班牙了——把金雞納藥第一次從秘魯帶到歐洲，人就拿她的名字作了藥名。　（未完）</p>
<h3>糧食　七萬餘包洋米到滬　定貨行家與囤戶猶在大量作崇</h3>
<p>洋米大批到滬、日商山下汽船會社之Blyo　Marn輪由仰光（昨報誤戰西貢）運來大量洋米七萬餘包、昨午已抵滬、停靠浦東鴻升碼頭起卸、聞日內尚有大宗到埠、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨晨　見挺秀、期貨囚新交易迄未　到船隻、日來接洽之定貨尚難作實、且傳曾有一二批因無船裝而作罷、因此客囤雖以國際風雲緩和而乏激刺、然其購買之興奮迄未見衰、並以一般高貨、早抵限盤、當局限價嚴厲、致使一般懷貨者　聞港電報漲、遂都不願脫出、市上高貨因是殊鮮、一般作客在乏貨應購之下、均轉意於中段貨、一時中段貨去路頓旺、賣戶乘機扳俏、喊聲直起、形勢較前愈緊、迄收盤未見遜色、而視收盤價此前又提元砠、計一號西貫八十五元八十四元半、二號八十元、一號暹邏八十五元、次至八十三元、火絞八十四元、小絞七十六元、米　七十三元、碎尖六十七元至六十四元半、定貨籌碼又趁機扳俏、故各月期路貨又被抬高五六角至近元、一號西貢二三月份開九十六元半、路貨九十八元至九十八元三五角、小絞現九十元零五角、九十一元、九十一元半、二月份八十八元、八十八元三五角、八十九元一角、二月下三月初八十九元至八十九元半、成交又有六七百噸、現米開出一萬多包、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米天時轉晴、來源繼續湧到、致成供過於求、不以洋米之堅緊而齊驅、售價續貶半元、開崑山原粳百零七元半百零七元、斛見百零三元半百零二元、青角薄稻斛見九十九元半、九十九元、</p>
<p>糯米去路、復以大戶囤收轉暢、且以市貨無多、價隨洋米提升半元、開香港特元八十三元半、普通八十二元半、</p>
<h3>粉市緊張如故</h3>
<p>麺粉昨日不脫緊張之局、蓋以本廠粉棧輩、雖有供給、而一時不能取現、故洋粉需要、依然孔亟、更值米價高貴聲中、行囤手貨、均有意外之慾望、統市做開　樓牌　粉二十五元五角五分、金龍牌　粉二十四元五分、成交一萬包左右、聞洋粉路貨尚有三四十萬包、將於月底月初抵埠、但目下途次常有阻礙、隨時有中斷之虞、故市面脚地尚　、</p>
<p>小麥來源、仍告清寂、洋麥船隻、因途中損壞、尚須延緩一週或十天之期、內地杜麥亦以產價高昂、到貨寥落、各廠原料需要雖殷、終以無貨收買為憾、聞租界棧麥價叩四十元大關、由本街辦去數十包、其餘交易岑寂如常、</p>
<h3>證券　公債買方　餘勇可買</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市繼續挺進、吃戶大都有力、餘勇可買、如信孚號之不斷買進、已經多日、昨尚無滿足之意、貿大之買進又是一枝生力軍、此時而有此價、其中必有組織、將來之鉅大變化、勢不能免、但祗抬丙種一種、又顯示人以弱點、姑觀其後可也、昨日上午信孚獨進四十餘萬、其餘聯和鴻大永康同順等買進、亦復不少、同康已在出籠、大德恒孚亦出脫不少、信孚抬高至六十六元開盤、惟恐其或墜、午後信孚繼續再拖二三十萬、恒康副之、開盤曾抬至六元外、鴻大同康恒孚賣出、曾回小至五元七角、近收盤時忽貿大有三十萬胃口、市價再抬至六　外、其時賣戶祗聯益易中聯和甡昶、已不足與抗、故結果上漲絕不一致、大都漲五八角、而丙種獨漲一元零五分、可見抬價祗注重一種而已、成交約二百五六十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交三友實業社股三十股、價為二十四元、</p>
<p>倫敦十九日（週三）電、今日中國外債及遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、仍告平滯、祗麥加利銀行股獨降二先令六便士、價為七鎊十五先令、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗跌跌漲漲　棉花需要不起</h3>
<p>紗市續見上升、但趨勢仍在　不定中、此因人心恍惚、加之投機者時進時出、且額子殊巨、使得檯面起伏不一、至於實銷稍見開展、但大量交易、仍以運輸困難、不得　批採辦也、二十支雙馬高價為一千二百九十八元、低價為一千二百五十五元、午後始做一千二百六十八元、跌至一千二百六十四元、最後價為一千二百六十六元、今日有棉紗一千零四十件運往香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日午後堅昂之氣、且塲中買者多而賣戶少、形勢較緊、首盤價為一千二百八十元、微升至八十三元、多頭吐出、跌至一千二百七十一元、此時小公司方面大都來進、於是互相高喊、抬至一千二百九十八元、詎價格旣升、謠風隨之而起、標金忽落百元、由此塲內跌風突生、叫賣聲大振、一挫跌至一千二百五十五元、旋後盈利者扒補、又復回上至一千二百七十四元、收盤價為一千二百六十八元、查半日間成交統計九千一百五十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港四七五　內地五</p>
<p>寗波一二　同行七、六五〇</p>
<p>統計九、一五〇</p>
<p>現棉情况、稍見安靜、此因紗市較穩、但廠方需要不旺、所以大勢依然平平、</p>
<p>紐約棉布、市况靜寂而參差、因有同業買進及空頭抵補、市價又突趨挺進、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲　至八磅因不等、印棉略疲、昨日連同預測低落　羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、大槪似因　紗市塲冉趨堅定、外滙又入平穩之態、故昨日原棉之零星交易、略有數起、</p>
<h3>疋頭　有了投機市場　布市紊亂</h3>
<p>布廠　昨市趨勢平穩、乃因實際交易清淡、棉布存底太厚、人氣髤懈、故售盤欲漲無力、白貨一部份、細布斜紋漲每疋二角半至五角、粗布漲每疋二角半、漂染布開價互有參差、小額仍售原盤、本街門市店以天氣乍晴、交易略增、微有添辦、客幫交易寥落、閩浙幫　貨若斷若續、港幫雖運輸暢通、但採購不旺、昨成交斜紋色布粗布一百餘件、今日有疋頭四十八件運厦門、又三百七十五件運香港、又一百三十五件運新加坡、</p>
<p>東布　狂升疾降、起伏仍鉅、白貨龍頭細布市塲、晨盤最高價升至四十五元三角、旋即回降至四十二元八角、後市又復抬升至四十四元二角半、終以實銷呆滯、仍回落至四十三元六七角、結果較前日收盤漲每疋五角左右、惟期貨則不然、（取引所）本月份因軋空關係、狂抬至四十五元三角、與三月期收盤價相等、</p>
<h3>糖市　車白微升</h3>

<h3>忍敎羣稚歛歡容</h3>
<p>— 問大</p>
<p>—新普育堂訪問—</p>
<p>是個朔風凜冽的下午，記者作了次南而新普育堂戰後三年餘來第一個訪問者，想不到烽火餘燼的淪陷　區中，尙有如此完美的孤兒樂園，以一路所見的敗坦殘壁及種種砲火所賜之千瘡百孔景象來對映，新普育堂所收容的孤兒與老弱殘廢，正如茁長在瓦礫堆中的春草，在惡劣困苦的環境下，他們需要滋潤，需要培植，方能不夭折，方能欣欣向榮。現將所親見的，所感觸的，縷述在下面，向讀者作一個側面的報吿，在盡報導的職責以外，實含有至誠摯的呼籲之聲。</p>
<p>環境</p>
<p>在一百二十餘畝的廣塲上，建立着幢幢洋樓，掩隱在林木葱蘢間，這裏面分設育嬰堂，孤兒院（分男孩部女孩部），殘廢院，養老院，瘋人收容所，孤寡住舍，免費診所，和平民義務學校。每一部份設有休息室，敎室，藥室和臥室，而由修女一人執掌敎養管理之責。設備中最値得稱崇的是衛生的講究，即在嚴冬，每人須每週沐浴一次；遇息病，立刻送入病房治理，使與他人隔離；其次便是臥室的整潔，井井有序的鐵床，平舖着潔白的被褥絲毫沒有零亂之狀。就設備的情形而論，該堂尙能多收二倍乃至三倍於現在的孤兒與老弱殘廢，可是拙於經費，維持現狀猶嫌不足，故該堂主持者祗得忍痛將許多應做的救濟放棄，而一心貫注於敎養現有的孤兒，大好環境與設備惟有期諸他日來廣事收容。</p>
<p>敎養</p>
<p>慈善事業，端在敎養兼施，方能使孤兒他日立足社會，新普育堂對這一點極加注意，而且能切實做功。育嬰堂中即設有不少敎育玩具，幼孩嬉戲其間，無不笑口常開，稍長的孤兒，男的在學校，每天有四小時課程；女的則讀書之外，再敎以縫紉剌繡。雖年逾六旬的龍鍾老翁老婦和已成殘廢的也每天受識字敎育，平時則做些輕便手工，如穿鈕子，織手套，做紙花等，此項收人雖微，也可挹注堂中支出的一部份。主持的修女們，堂長係比利時人，其本國亦已淪人悲慘命運，而仍眷注此間的事業，撑持艱危現况；副堂長華藉，新普育堂卽立時即人內服務，至今近三十年，爲人所愛戴；共除修女全都有仁愛犧牲救世的信心，爲孤苦的人們服務，待孤兒如自己的兒女，老年者如自己的長輩，親熱之狀，猶如家人。</p>
<p>溯往</p>
<p>回溯既往，聽修女們津津道來，像一頁燦爛的歷史，而事實上確是一頁燦爛的歴史，祗要看巍峨的院舍，完美的設伽，歴年來收容孤兒與貧病者數字的驚人，就能想見創造者的偉績，繼續者的奮鬥精神。當華軍自　西撤，南市慘遭淪陷之日，修女們疏散堂中收容者，日以繼夜，方全數安置於呂班路安全地點，而當地一般貧民，顧了老，顧不了少，竟紛粉將幼孩甚至嬰孩委棄於堂中，法租界鐵門關閉後，數百孩稚，遂哭哭啼啼於砲火炸彈聲中，有的驚死，有的病死，有的餓死，直至幾經交涉請求，修女們趕來，僅一孩奄奄未絕，共餘已全部死亡，這是如何慘痛的往事！現在這個獲救的孩子，已有三四歲了，與陸續被收容進來的生活在一起，可是現在又逢斷糧，這羣孩子的生命又將逢到最嚴　的威脅，主持者自不忍見此慘痛情形的重演，所以盡力想法維持，而有此呼籲之請。</p>
<p>展望</p>
<p>記者親歴其間，見孤兒過着有秩序的生活，每個小臉都現着無邪的笑容；老弱殘廢亦恬靜度日，在安享他們的天年：這現狀需要社會人仕去支持，換言之，新普育堂因無固定基金，在此米糧昂貴的今日，已臨絕望的深淵，該堂的前途，亦即孤兒與老弱殘廢前途，已僅能希望社會人士去支持。該堂曾把無數孤兒敎養成人，女的則擇人選配，盡了他們的責任，但現在連日常給養都成問題，這種圓滿的將來史難談到，社會人仕能忍使他們的敎養半途而廢，孩稚的生命中道大折嗎？寫至此，孤兒們小臉上的笑容又活現眼前，孩稚不解事，何嘗知斷糧卽在旦夕，然而社會人什「忍敎孩稚斂　容」嗎？我們都會因自己的兒女不歡而不歡，但我們亦應知道尙有無數無父母的孤兒卽將陷於絕境，非惟笑容永斂，且將生命不再，我們應如何給以他們所需要的，像滿足自己兒女的慾望一樣。爲孤兒們展望而途，惟有希望此次呼籲得到讀者執烈的響應，盡量去幫助這羣可憐的孤兒以老弱殘廢。</p>
<p>本報前日已有專文籲請各界捐助米，煤，棉花，醫藥品，火油，麵紛，布，油，及金錢，收件處例後，收到捐項當陸續在本報發表，以昭大信。</p>

<h3>大　守秩序</h3>
<h3>神聖的任務</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>大上海淪陷後，社會上熱心人士組微難民收容所者有之，設立難重敎養院者有之，奔走呼號，爲不幸的同胞謂命呼籲，其熱忱可嘉，其精神可佩！但是曇花一現，爲日無多，難民收容所爲了經費艱窘，紛紛將難民遣送回籍；而有些慈善機關更可悲的發生了舞弊案在這三年之中，果然「孤島」因畸形發展而使短視的人們忘了現實的悲痛，但像舞弊案等不幸事件，也是使各種慈善事業發生陣碍的原因之一。</p>
<p>現在在南市的一角，有這樣一個孤兒的樂園，老弱者的天堂，在抱犧牲救世精神的修女們苦榦之下，支撑了這許多時日，而且已經獲得了良好的成績。誰無父母，誰無子女，讀了前面的「新普育堂訪問記」後，我們應該反省而慚愧。反省—我們走錯了步驟；慚愧—這本來是自己的責仟啊！</p>
<p>據兩天本報木埠新聞的記載，他們每月需費　萬六千元，除經常收人六千元外，不敷一萬兀，以一年計，亦不過十萬元，鑒於經濟市塲波動之際，一週的損失就是一萬萬元，十萬元的數目更是微乎其微了，希望各界人士，爲自己，爲子孫，爲國家，爲民族，來完成這神聖的任務吧</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「據馬廳長說，這是袁鎭守使在你們舉行五週紀念會的那一天，親自把你看中的」父親補充着說明。</p>
<p>湘綺在那一天，雖然也見到幾個軍人坐在來賓席上，但無論如何，也不會想到那個態度最惡劣的大胖子，就是存心想呑嚼她的袁鎭守使。</p>
<p>「他大槪有多少年紀　？」掙扎了好半嚮，她才忍不住這樣問。</p>
<p>「其實也不過三十多歲。」母親搶着回答。</p>
<p>「三十多？」這倒大大的出乎湘綺的預料，她記得那大所見的幾個軍人的年齡，最少的也有四十多歲了。「最好請爸爸先去要張像片來看看。」</p>
<p>母親好像還嫌多事，便又用着很沉重的聲音說：</p>
<p>「孩子，事情是…一定…好的…。第一件…，他們的…聘禮…送…來，你大哥看病的費…費用，便不愁…了。你…何必…三…心兩意呢？」</p>
<p>但父親却贊　湘綺的主張。</p>
<p>過了一個多禮拜，羅老先生便從馬廳長那裏帶回了兩件東西：一件是一張三十多歲，穿着便裝，相貌很淸瘦的男子；一件是教育廳第二科科員的委仟狀。</p>
<p>湘綺對那照片注視了好半嚮，十分懷疑地說。</p>
<p>「這個人好像是那一天我沒有見過的。」</p>
<p>「也許穿着軍裝和穿平裝有些不同，假是絕對不會假的！」父親從旁解釋着。</p>
<p>事情便像這樣決定了。</p>
<p>四十天之後，就由胡督軍做證婚，在天津最大的一家菜館裏，演出了一幕類似滑稽劇的婚禮。最神奇的倒還不是這一個婚禮，而是那位善變的新郞：照片上的本來是一個三十多歲，長相很淸秀的人；隔了兩個月不到，却已變成一個四十多歲，身材又高又胖，半像牛，牛像猛虎的大漢了。　（三六）</p>

<h3>「三魔會」</h3>
<p>— 程氷奴</p>
<p>主演「三魔會」的是凱卡綏，彼得勞雷，卡洛夫，羅哥西，及海倫派麗許等。凱卡綏是美國無綫電播音明星，他的「扮相」很像羅克，除了口惹懸河之外，做工實在並不見得高明，不過此公異常賣力，頗有一些人喜歡他；彼得勞雷雖然渾身是戲，但「三魔會」裏並沒有多少戲好做；卡洛夫和羅哥西，同樣處於無足輕重的地位，「三魔會」云云，驟看似乎異常刺激，其實也不過如此而已。</p>
<p>「三魔會」的故事，大槪為了太要刺激的原故，弄得太不近情理，三個魔王為了要奪海倫派麗許的財產，先之以鬼怪恐嚇，繼則想把她置之死地，可是方法却笨拙得很。凱卡綏是播音明星，在海倫生日，被請到她家裏去唱堂會，三魔的籠罩在這屋子里的古怪傳說，終於不攻自破。</p>
<p>除了這個不通的故事之外，全劇倒也不無可取的地方，那便是恐怖空氣的　厚。導演者利用音響效果，故佈疑陣，使觀衆為之手發悚然，諸如羅哥西作法，屋子裏燈光全滅，鬼哭神號，狂風暴雨；凱卡塞獨自到地底機關裹探險，戳穿三魔的秘密，以及晚上睡覺，黑暗中看見一個會行走的火光，其實却是一個狗尾等，都於緊張刺激之中，夾雜着不少的笑料。</p>
<p>然而編劇者對於這點成就，似乎還不感覺到滿足，所以又再加上幾支歌曲，使愛好歌曲的仕女，也有欣賞的機會，於是「三魔會」便變成「恐怖，滑稽，歌唱」三種作料而成的三鮮湯了。</p>

<p>中旅八週紀念規定上演的五支名劇，已演過了「日出」「李香君」「花木蘭」三劇。當「花木蘭」上演之夕，唐若靑以體力不支，突然暈倒於化妝室中。當時不但騷動了後台諸人員，而觀衆也都表示關心。但是五支名劇排演日期早已決定，所以這三天中，唐若靑雖已恢復康健，可是為使已定座的觀衆不致失望起見，決准期於明晚起獻演「新梅蘿香」。「花木蘭」則等待「雷雨」演罷後再演。聽說「新梅蘿香」，除唐若靑飾演反派之都會少婦小春蘭，以及唐槐秋仍演老牌白森卿之外，將起用劇壇新人端木蘭心，飾演梅蘿香一角。端木蘭心是具有着驚人的演戲天才，聞中旅先請其客串，與觀衆相見，然後再聘為基本演員。</p>

<h3>U.S. House of Representatives Passes Appropriation for Developing Naval and Air Bases; Fortifications to be Constructed in Newfoundland, Guam, and Other Locations; Military Attachés Dispatched to the Dutch East Indies and Singapore</h3>
<p>Washington – Amidst the danger of the United States declaring war on Japan, the House of Representatives yesterday passed with an overwhelming majority a bill allocating US$245,228,500 for establishing naval and air bases in Newfoundland, Trinidad, Samoa, and Guam. The bill was then submitted to the Senate. Guam is located 1,500 miles south of Yokohama. The House, disregarding Japan’s opposition, decided to establish a naval base on the island, sparking the most bellicose remarks against Japan by American lawmakers in years. The passage of this bill is the first step in President's proposal last week to supplement national defense expenditures by $898,000,000. Representative Vinson, a Democrat from Georgia and Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, when initiating the debate on establishing naval bases in Guam and Samoa, read a letter from Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, advising Congress to disregard Japan’s opposition and proceed with expanding bases in the Pacific. The letter stated, "The US proposal to improve Guam's defense is by no means for offensive purposes. If Japan deems it as offensive, I think we can disregard Japan's suspicions. Fundamentally, Guam is a US territory. Our actions should be based on the best interests of the United States and should not be influenced by foreign countries." Vinson then recited a letter of similar nature from Secretary of the Navy Knox, stating that improving Guam's defense is of utmost importance to the Navy. Vinson added critically that the U.S. Navy is now fully prepared to deal with any contingency. During the debate, Representative Faddis, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, urged the United States to notify Japan immediately that if Japan attacked Singapore, the U.S. Navy would cut off their main supply line and annihilate them. Representative Anderson, a Republican from Minnesota, urged the U.S. to impose a complete embargo on raw materials to Japan. Faddis said that the blood of the Chinese people was still fresh on Japan’s hands, yet they were thinking of further portraying themselves as peace-loving people to the whole world, which was tantamount to secretly threatening the United States and forcing the United States to cooperate with them. The time for the United States to rise up has come. We do not need to worry that the Japanese will seize Singapore. Japan would never dare to engage in a war with a first-class nation unless absolutely necessary.

<p>Nomura Makes Speech in the United States; Strives to Ease Tensions</p>
<p>Washington – Japanese Ambassador Nomura, in a moderate tone last night, strove to ease tensions in the Far East and stated that he did not believe that war would break out between the United States and Japan. He also said that if the United States did not want to launch a war, then war could be avoided. However, he insisted that Japan would always abide by the Axis treaty. (International News Service dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Washington – Nomura told reporters yesterday that Japan did not like seeing a great power establish naval and air bases near Japan. However, Japan recognized that the Philippines, Guam, and Samoa were US territories and therefore the United States had the right in principle to make any arrangements on those islands. He believed that the United States would not build huge naval and air bases in the Philippines. Someone then asked Ambassador Nomura to explain the report made to the Diet this week by Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi, who said that Japan was trying to ensure that the Philippines would not endanger Japan in the future. Nomura replied that he did not believe that we have the terror of being threatened by the Philippines. He said that Japan certainly did not want to see naval and army bases, such as Guam and Samoa, approaching. When it came to the question of whether he considered the Philippines to be included within the scope of Japan's economic expansion, Nomura firmly refused to answer. He pointed out that the Philippines still belonged to the United States, but that Japan had already obtained a large amount of raw materials from the Philippines and also sold products to the Philippines. Nomura said that Japan was interested in the House's approval of the Guam defense works. He said that Japan considered its southward advance to be merely an economic event. (United Press dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Washington – Japanese Ambassador Nomura told a United Press reporter that Japan hoped to quickly resolve the China Incident and said that he hoped that the Chongqing government could also participate in this effort. If China could establish peace, then the United States' policy of equal trade opportunities and Japan's goals could be integrated. In the current occupied areas of China, the situation has formed a prelude to this equality. Nomura emphasized that Japan's final procedure was to give third countries complete commercial equality in China. Regarding the Soviet Union, Nomura said that Japan was negotiating with the Soviet Union on long-pending cases, including fishery agreements and the demarcation of the border between Manchuria and Mongolia. Regarding the issue of demarcation between Manchuria and Mongolia, Japan must have talked with the Soviet Union about concluding a non-aggression treaty. (United Press dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>If Japan Does Not Change Its Current Policy, It Is Difficult to Hope for Restoring Friendship with the United States</p>
<p>New York – Ambassador Nomura has now arrived and is in a time of tense US-Japan relations. Both Tokyo and Washington believe that Nomura will present Roosevelt with a kind of magically effective proposal to dispel war rumors and restore friendship between the two countries. However, reporters in the United States, within the Japanese cabinet and among the people, could not find anyone who believed that this proposal could succeed unless unexpected changes occurred in world affairs. It is not easy to reconcile the United States and Japan, and the prerequisite for reconciliation is the following three conditions: (1) Japan must have a strong and powerful government that unifies the national will and represents the will of the people. Since the Manchurian Incident, the Japanese cabinet has changed frequently, and no one can control the warlords. (2) Japan must enlarge its Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere plan. (3) The Sino-Japanese War should be ended, and China should remain a free and independent country. (4) Japan should withdraw from the alliance with Germany and Italy. Some observers believe that Nomura is prepared to act quickly or to make generous concessions when the time is ripe, depending on the fate of the Axis powers in Europe. (United Press dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Washington – The situation in the Far East has become the focus of attention for political and diplomatic circles here. In general, it is believed that unless Japan changes its current policy in the Western Pacific, the United States cannot concede an inch of the position it holds in the Far East.

<h3>Australia and India Prepare to Cope with Contingencies; Australian Troops Landing in Singapore Stationed at Various Strongholds in Malaya</h3>
<p>Melbourne – Acting Australian Prime Minister Fadden said in a speech that after reviewing the national defense system, the government has continued to take precautions to prevent sudden and unexpected events. Australia will not take any action or words that could shake peace in the Pacific. If war is forced upon Australia's doorstep, it will not be caused by us. Others should not think that we have no way to call for help and are not suitable for such a great test. The Australian troops landing in Malaya are of the same quality as the Australian troops who defeated the Italian army in Libya and are famous for the Gallipoli campaign. Australia is prepared to cope with any event and believes that Britain will win victory. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Bombay – The entire territory of India is now closely watching the tense situation in the Far East. The arrival of Australian troops in Singapore has aroused widespread satisfaction.

The Indian government is now prepared to cope with any contingency. (Reuters dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>Singapore – An official spokesman declared last night that the arrival of Australian troops in Singapore was enough to further ensure the safety of Malaya. Early yesterday morning, the landing soldiers were dispatched to various strongholds in Malaya. The spokesman said that the arrival of Australian troops in Malaya should give greater optimism about security issues. Australia should be proud of its sons and daughters who are undertaking important work in the defense of the empire. The so-called important work was first in Britain, then in the Middle East, and now in East Asia. At the same time, the army commander, Lieutenant General Bennett, declared that the Australian troops were undertaking serious work in Malaya. He broadcasted, "We are undertaking serious work here. Australians have always regarded Singapore as Australia's outpost, so we feel that defending Singapore is very helpful to our own national defense. Our troops have been trained as assault soldiers, and I dare to say that they will be able to fight bravely, just like the heroic political achievements of their ancestors in the past. I now shout to the people of Malaya, your war is our war. If the enemy comes to Malaya, Australians will also come and severely injure this invading enemy." (United Press dispatch of the 20th)</p>

It is generally believed that the Dutch East Indies government will accept these demands, but with the condition that when Japanese experts inspect the Dutch East Indies oil fields, they should be accompanied by Tredenton. A meeting will be held this morning to exchange opinions on the Dutch East Indies and Japanese proposals, and meetings will continue tomorrow morning. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Senate Debates Lend-Lease Bill</h3>
<p>Washington – Democratic Senator Bailey, during the third day of Senate debate on the Lend-Lease Bill yesterday, declared that the implementation of this bill meant that the United States was interfering in the European war. He hoped that this interference would not mean war. If it became war, then he was prepared to participate in the war. This bill could give the United States the opportunity to liberate the world from totalitarian revolution. Another Democratic Senator, Connally, declared that democratic countries must act in unison, otherwise they would be defeated individually. If the Axis powers were victorious in Europe, they would soon attempt to invade North and South America. (Reuters dispatch of the 20th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Has the International Situation Eased?</h3>
<p>Some believe that the international situation has eased somewhat recently. This impression may not be accurate. In terms of the situation, starting from the September 18th Incident in 1931 further back, and starting from the end of August 1939 closer up, every minute has been gradually worsening, until today and beyond, continuing to worsen, never stopping, and certainly not improving in the slightest. As for the atmosphere feeling tense or relaxed, it is only the psychological reaction of those who do not grasp the core of the situation following superficial fluctuations, and there is no change in the continuously worsening international situation. Even the panic a few days ago and the relief recently are both excessive.</p>
<p>Why do some think it has eased recently? In Europe: the agreement between Turkey and Bulgaria is merely a side issue in the evolution of the international situation and is insufficient to prevent the possible expansion of the Balkan war. Looking at it from another angle, it can also be seen as planting another hidden cause for the worsening situation. In short, the world situation considers the European situation to be a very important link. The European situation has already unfolded as it is now. Even if a settlement were mediated by an unexpected opportunity, it would at most make the war "stop" for a few years, but it would not be the "end" of the war. Moreover, there is no hope of mediation succeeding. Everything depends on the decisive battle between Britain and Germany. Recognizing this point, we know that the surface may have some temporary relaxation, but it is irrelevant to the fundamental issue.</p>
<p>In the Pacific: the Sino-Japanese War has already reached its fifth year. The front line may be stalemated or active, but the fact is that it is comprehensively stuck in a state of war. The current trend has also spread beyond the scope of China and Japan, with Japan's southward advance as the center, touching French Indochina, Thailand, the Dutch East Indies, and the United States and the Commonwealth of Australia. The panic a few days ago was due to the tense situation of Japan's southward advance. The Japanese authorities repeatedly stated that they would implement their strategy and must realize the so-called co-prosperity sphere, regardless of all protests, regardless of all opposition, and so on. Not only did they state this, but everything they did was obviously a layout for gradually implementing the southward advance. Therefore, the signs made Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia have to take joint countermeasures and actions. As a result, the general public felt that there would be a new war that would break out at any moment in that area, and the situation seemed precarious. The recent situation has no reason to be comforting. The biggest reason is only that the Japanese side's tone has softened. For example, Foreign Minister Matsuoka said that Japan does not intend to be the leader of all the people in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but only has confidence in having the strength to lead. Also, Foreign Minister Ohashi said that the government does not want to achieve its goals by force, but only wants to find solutions through negotiation. Also, Ambassador to the UK Shigemitsu verbally assured British Foreign Minister Butler that Japan had no intention of attacking British territories in the Pacific. Also, Ambassador to the United States Nomura also said that a US-Japan war could be avoided, and so on. In addition, the Japanese have proposed in both Tokyo and London that they are willing to mediate the European war. This is probably an act directed by Hitler, one of the faces of his usual peace offensives, and US Congressman Faddis immediately mocked it, saying, "The blood of the Chinese people on Japan's hands has not yet dried, yet they are thinking of further portraying themselves as peace-loving people to the whole world." However, the Japanese making this proposal at this time can also correspond and complement their other softened tones. Because of these various reasons, some think it has eased. If the world is convinced that the situation has eased somewhat, then there is no doubt that it is a great success of the Japanese side's anesthetization operation, and it is also a great success of borrowing "time." And the United States, in addition to unremittingly carrying out practical work, such as promoting the Aid Bill, sending warships to the west, and fortifying Guam, Secretary of State Welles also made a ruthless exposure of the Japanese side's words, saying, "In today's extremely serious situation in the world, the US government is more interested in the actions of other countries than in the statements made by their spokesmen." This is a pointed statement. Sweet words are useless, where is the easing? The intention is to relax the hearts of all parties, possibly to delay the countermeasures and actions of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia, and then wait for the arrival of the environment they expect and seize the most favorable opportunity to realize their southward advance. In short, the key to the safety of the Pacific lies in whether Japan corrects its aggression in the invasion of China and the southward advance in facts and actions. Although this is related to the European situation and the entire international situation, it forms a separate link. No matter how the European situation is, no matter how the world situation is, the key is always here. If the key is not resolved for one day, the crisis will not be eliminated for one day, and Japan has so far no sign of correcting its aggressive strategy, and is obviously waiting for an opportunity to act. So, how can there be any so-called easing? The Pacific situation has unfolded as it is now. The remaining diverging paths are one, within the form and scope of the Sino-Japanese War, to force Japan to turn back from failure by China's frontal warfare and the strong support of the United States, etc.; the other is to leave the fighting to the Western Pacific and then force Japan to turn back. The decision of the diverging paths is greatly related to the decisive battle between Britain and Germany in Europe. If the United States' attitude is wise and strong, and it does not further adopt direct and active means, then no matter how soft the tone of the aggressors may be, it will at most make them temporarily wander in the above-mentioned diverging paths, and there is still no hope of restoring peace in the Pacific.</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Existing Japanese Forces; Unable to Increase Troop Deployment; Newly Organized Regiments Reduced in Size; Progress on All Chinese Fronts</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A military spokesman stated to news reporters today that, in order to deceive the world and for the purpose of estimating its troop strength in China, Japan is currently broadcasting news of an increase in its army's size. In reality, the Japanese side is only reorganizing its existing forces and has not increased troop deployment. Currently, newly organized regiments of the Japanese army have been reduced from the former three battalions to two battalions, totaling 1,700 men, whereas previously there were 3,700 men. Therefore, the Japanese side can establish new regiments and new divisions without increasing its total troop strength, and can proclaim that they have surplus strength for a southward advance.

<h3>Rumor that Germany Will Force Greece to Ceasefire with Italy</h3>
<p>London: The Daily Telegraph diplomatic correspondent says that people here believe that Hitler's next move will be to coerce Greece into a ceasefire with Italy. If Greece refuses, Hitler will immediately threaten to send his armored divisions to Thessaly and Macedonia. The Greek army is currently fully engaged in fighting in Albania. Without reinforcements, it will be difficult to resist attacks from fresh German troops. After defeating the Italian army in North Africa, Britain is now able to increase its aid to Greece in the sea, land, and air. To make Greece better prepared to deal with the threat, it should be advised to stop its offensive in Albania to conserve ammunition for confronting the new enemy. A large delegation of American staff representatives has been in Athens for several months and must now be planning something. Germany is now planning to supply arms to the rebel factions in Macedonia and Croatia to carry out terrorist activities against the governments of Greece and southern Yugoslavia, to coerce the two countries. It is heard that most of these arms are produced by the Škoda factory in Pilsen. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

For several weeks prior, British officers had led patriotic Abyssinian troops in guerrilla warfare, frequently applying pressure, once attacking to within a few feet of the city's strong defenses, then approaching to attack for five days, finally cooperating with the British Air Force to deliver the final blow. British aircraft transmitted messages, allowing the patriotic Abyssinian troops to capture some of the Italian garrison that had fled the bombing. The remaining Italian garrison is retreating southeast towards the city of Bahrdar Georgis, south of Lake Tana, repeatedly harassed by small units of Abyssinian troops along the way. Dancilla is located at the foot of the northern slope of the 7,000-foot Abyssinian plateau and is the meeting point of two camel trails from the Abyssinian capital to the Sudanese border town of Gallabat and to a town on the Blue Nile. The city is sparsely populated, but since the Italian occupation, a road has been built along the camel trail to facilitate the transport of locally produced coffee, wheat, and other commodities.

<p>London: According to an official announcement, the Italian garrison in the place of Meiga, Abyssinia, has surrendered to South African forces. Over 600 Italian soldiers were captured, most of whom were of European descent. In addition, countless cannons and machine guns were seized. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters special correspondent reported that the Greek army achieved local victories in several locations on the northern Albanian border yesterday. Although Italian reinforcements have arrived, the Greek army is still maintaining its offensive on the entire front. Several divisions of fresh Italian troops have been seen moving between Elbasan and the Skumbi River. The Italian army also counterattacked in the districts of Tufari and Moschopolis, but the Greek army attacked at night, breaking through the Italian lines in the Tufari district and capturing hundreds of enemies.

<p>Southern National Capital: According to reliable sources, German aircraft flew over Greece on Tuesday for reconnaissance purposes, without dropping bombs, and the Greek side did not fire upon them. It is not yet known whether the German aircraft used bases in Bulgaria or bases in Romania. People here commented on the matter, saying that Hitler will use his war of nerves in an attempt to force Greece to abandon its war against Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>British, Australian, and South African Air Forces Conduct Intense Activity; Assisting British and Greek Forces in East Africa and Albania</h3>
<p>Cairo: The latest communique issued by the Middle East Command describes the intense activity of the British Air Force, the South African Air Force, and the Australian Air Force. It is reported that the airfields on the Italian Dodecanese Islands were bombed on the nights of February 16th and 17th. In the past two days, the British Air Force has assisted the Greek army in combat, concentrating bombing on Italian positions in the Tepelene area. Enemy troops and military buildings north of Tepelene were also heavily bombed. Bombing results could not be seen due to fog on the ground. Several squadrons of British fighters conducted offensive patrols. British aircraft also continued to provide assistance to British forces on all fronts in Italian East Africa. Military targets in and near Keren were attacked several times. While conducting offensive patrols, South African Air Force fighters shot down two Italian bombers. After strafing enemy aircraft on the ground at Karga, one bomber was seen to catch fire. Enemy fighters attempted to intercept British aircraft but were repelled. Military targets in Meiga, Abyssinia, were also bombed. On February 17th and 18th, enemy aircraft attacked Benghazi, one of which was shot down by an Australian squadron. The remaining aircraft were also heavily damaged and were likely unable to return to base. Anti-aircraft fire shot down one enemy bomber. One British bomber did not return to base.

<h3>Japan Suggests to Britain its Willingness to Mediate in the European War; Matsuoka Has Formally Sent a Letter to Eden; Britain's Policy Will Not Change and the Offer Will Be Rejected</h3>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka has sent a special letter to British Foreign Minister Eden, stating that he is willing to take any necessary measures to restore normalcy not only in the Far East but also throughout the world. This official action, which supports the remarks made by Tokyo spokesman Ishii yesterday, gives special meaning to the idea of ​​mediating the war, which is far different from an occasional suggestion by a subordinate. Although Ishii stated that he had not consulted with Germany and Italy, this is a major step from the head of a government that has treaty relations with Germany and Italy. Matsuoka's letter will of course receive the consideration requested by the proposer, but the general and unchangeable principles of British policy are unlikely to change as a result. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>London: Undersecretary Butler's remarks in the House of Commons on Wednesday confirmed the claim that Japan will mediate in the European war. When a Member of Parliament asked the Undersecretary to make a statement on the situation in the Far East, Butler mentioned the general outline of the situation in the Far East, which has become increasingly tense due to certain events, such as the dispute between Thailand and French Indochina, and said, "A Japanese official spokesman made a statement to the press yesterday, and the British Foreign Minister has now received a special letter from the Japanese Foreign Minister, couched in gentle terms, with the general content being the same as the remarks of the Japanese spokesman. The British government is now paying considerable attention to this letter." (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>London: Japan has formally notified Britain of its willingness to mediate in the European war. Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka has sent a special letter to British Foreign Minister Eden. The letter is couched in polite terms and is largely the same as the statement made by the Japanese official spokesman yesterday. Observers here say that they believe that Britain will definitely reject this suggestion. (United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Miyako Shimbun newspaper said in an editorial today that Japan is the only country qualified to mediate in the European war. Although there is currently no hope for such mediation, Japan must be prepared to make contributions to mediation when the time is ripe. The Chugai Shogyo Shimpo newspaper also had an editorial, saying that Britain and the United States are now deliberately spreading unfounded rumors about the crisis in the Far East and are strengthening their military plans and defense work. Although the rumors will soon disappear, their war preparations cannot be laughed off. Japan can only promote its East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in response. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>London: A diplomatic correspondent for the News Chronicle published a startling comment regarding the source of the Japanese peace overture, saying that some observers believe that Japan and Germany have actually drawn up joint actions, in which Japan's activities in the Far East will be consistent with Germany's activities in Europe. This action was originally scheduled to be implemented last week, but for reasons that are not yet clear, the schedule was disrupted, so Japan issued a peace movement to divert attention, so that the disrupted schedule could be reorganized. Other observers believe that Japan's declaration and Matsuoka's telegram to the British Foreign Minister were directly instructed by the German Foreign Ministry and believe that this is a logical move by Hitler before implementing military operations in the spring, aimed at disrupting and diverting the attention of the United States, and again blaming Britain and the Allies for prolonging the war.

<h3>Japanese-Soviet Negotiations Now Beginning</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Information Bureau issued a communique this afternoon announcing that Japanese-Soviet trade talks will begin for the first time in Moscow on the 17th of this month, in accordance with the agreement recently reached between Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa and Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov.

<h3>Vietnam Increases Air Force Strength; Prohibits Japanese Rubber Shipments; Tokyo Accuses Vietnam of Anti-Japanese Activity</h3>
<p>Hanoi: According to semi-official French sources, over a hundred members of the French Air Force have arrived here by French ship and have immediately gone to various air force bases in Saigon and key points in Cambodia and Laos to serve. These air force personnel were sent here by ship from France to increase the strength of the Vietnamese Air Force because the French-German armistice agreement does not allow French aircraft to fly over French airspace. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A Hanoi dispatch yesterday stated that French Vietnam has prohibited Japanese commercial firms from exporting rubber. French officials have issued new orders controlling rubber exports. It is heard that the Vietnamese government will form a joint government-commercial rubber export company. Representatives from the four major rubber groups and the government will jointly organize the company. All rubber exports from Vietnam will be sold through the company. (United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: An article published here today strongly criticized the Vietnamese authorities, accusing Vietnam of engaging in anti-Japanese activities. It is reported that a French staff officer negotiated the purchase of 200 aircraft from Singapore, part of which was exchanged for information to be provided to Japan's plan for Singapore. This rumor was reported by the Japanese telegraph office in Hanoi, which stated that as a result of the investigation, it has been discovered that the French authorities have continuously adopted economic and military means with the aim of defeating the Japanese Air Force in Southeast Asia. This trend has become more obvious since Britain and the United States reacted strongly to Japan's mediation of the Thai-French Indochina border conflict, and since British Indian and Australian troops have gathered along the southwestern border of Thailand.

<p>European War Chat (30) (6)</p>
<h3>War Diary of a British Officer on the Western Front</h3>
<p>4 PM: Montdidier and Compiègne have both fallen.</p>
<p>6 PM: Enemy forces have occupied Forges-les-Eaux and Granville. Rumor has it that the vanguard has reached Beauvais and Pontoise, only twenty miles northwest of Paris.</p>
<p>June 9th, 9:45 AM: Yesterday afternoon, the situation changed rapidly. The German army, with mechanized units as its vanguard, launched a large-scale offensive north of Reims. They have already crossed the Aisne River in a rapid advance. The British and French air forces will use all their strength to prevent the movement of the enemy tank corps. This offensive may be the beginning of a major encirclement. The German army intends to penetrate deep into France as far as the Loire River, and then, disregarding the French government, negotiate peace directly with the French people.</p>
<p>June 10th: Bridges are mined, ready to be blown up. As usual, the national spirit of destruction is very lacking, often only blowing up a few bridge arches near the shore, making repairs very easy. The Loire River here is several hundred yards wide. I think if the French line collapses, and they still want to continue resisting, the Loire River will be the last line of defense.</p>
<p>June 12th, 11:30 AM: There are three fresh German divisions south of Reims. Yesterday, the French command retreated to Maine, stationed in the town. There are now eighty German divisions on the line from the Channel to Montmédy. The French army has only thirty-five exhausted divisions. France no longer has any hope of turning defeat into victory.</p>
<p>12:10 PM: One-third of the French troops in the occupied areas have been withdrawn, further confirming the rumor of the French army's demoralization. It is estimated that half of the soldiers in the French army have hometowns in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>11:00 PM: Very bad news again tonight: the Seine River line has been breached.</p>
<p>June 13th, 10:40 AM: The general opinion is that the French army is about to retreat completely. Last night, a French officer told me, "We only have thirty-five divisions. Normally, each division defends no more than seven kilometers, but now some divisions have to defend thirty kilometers. Some are indeed elite troops, but some are not very reliable. The German army has eighty divisions, all better equipped than us. What can you do?"</p>
<p>12:00 AM: It is said that tens of thousands of French soldiers have abandoned their weapons and fled to the south bank of the Marne River. It is a recognized fact that 60% of French shells fail to explode.</p>
<p>The British Air Force squadron is scheduled to fly to the coast tonight. If the situation is not very urgent, we may follow in a day or two.</p>
<p>June 14th: The French army abandoned Paris last night, and the German Fourteenth Army will occupy it today. Although heavy clouds and rain have prevented air force activity, judging from intercepted German military orders, a large-scale bombing will be launched as soon as the weather clears.</p>
<p>12:15 PM: General Georges announced that the French army will retreat to the Loire River defense line and has decided to abandon the Maginot Line. This report is a major turning point in the war.</p>
<p>3:59 PM: General Georges also announced, "All organized resistance has completely ceased."</p>
<p>June 15th: Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, left Orléans with Wu Daoer and Osborne, via Le Mans to Angers. Le Mans is the location of the transport command. We visited British Commander General Brooke. We also visited the naval officer in charge of the evacuation. His name seemed to be Gallat, a serious and shrewd man. I will never forget the atmosphere in his office. The office room was in a large building, connected by wide rooms on both sides. It was very hot in the evening, and the seven or eight naval officers working indoors were so hot that they rolled up their sleeves. The room was as silent as death. Except for the occasional whisper, no one spoke. Only when giving orders by phone could the only sound be heard. The voice of command was concise and powerful, making it easy to understand their intentions. The air in the room was like that in a church. Everyone had their own thing to do, and they were doing it wholeheartedly. Soldiers who came to the office, whether officers or soldiers, were touched by this solemn atmosphere.</p>
<p>In addition to the 12,000 people we were about to evacuate, there were approximately 75,000 British troops still in France.</p>
<p>June 16th: Yesterday, we hurriedly left Angers. After saying a few words to a pilot at the airport, I learned that German tanks were only fourteen miles away from the road. The Air Force Commander-in-Chief advised me to wait at the airport until all the planes had flown out before going to South Tours. Wu Daoer and Osborne and I set off immediately.</p>
<p>The scenery along the way was very good. I have been familiar with this area since I was a child, but I have never crossed the Loire River so early before. The sandy beaches next to the river were wide and flat, and both sides were vineyards, which felt as familiar as home to me. We followed the south bank of the river, and at every village and bridge, resolute elderly villagers stopped and inspected. They all carried rifles and were very able to endure hardship. They set up obstacles to prevent the enemy's lighter motorized units. Although they could not stop the progress of tanks, they could stop motorcycles and military vehicles.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we arrived at the headquarters of the British Air Force squadron south of Tours. The situation was chaotic. The relocation was originally scheduled to begin last night, but it was delayed by several hours. All kinds of objects were scattered all over the ground. This place was like a garbage dump this morning. There were officers' torn uniforms, typewriters, cars, trucks, medical supplies, etc. scattered everywhere on the grass.</p>
<p>We are waiting to depart, whether by car or plane, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>June 17th, 10:15 AM: This morning, the first reconnaissance plane brought accurate news of the enemy. German troops have entered Orléans. All the bridges have been blown up, and some places have caught fire. There were twelve vehicle-carrying vehicles parked on a small bridge twelve miles southwest of Orléans. This is nothing, but behind the tanks there were several refugee vehicles. The German engineering team is repairing the broken bridge. German tanks and French refugee vehicles are patiently waiting to cross the bridge together.</p>
<p>The military operation of retreating to the Bay of Biscay has not been completely completed.</p>
<p>The weather has provided a lot of convenience for the evacuation. Thunderstorms made it impossible to see clearly across the way. Last night, I hid under a Blenheim aircraft at the airport. Even though I was hiding there, the water passing under the plane almost washed me away.</p>
<p>Last night, a train drove by. An officer in our high-altitude artillery unit heard it in his sleep and thought it was a German mechanized unit. He immediately jumped out of bed but dislocated a toe. This was the first casualty in the high-altitude artillery unit.</p>
<p>12:00 PM: Received news of the French seeking peace.</p>
<p>5:30 PM: The last batch of ground personnel has departed.</p>
<p>5:50 PM: Air Force personnel and the Air Force Commander-in-Chief also flew away by plane.</p>
<p>5:55 PM: Wu Daoer, Osborne, and I, as well as thirty other officers, departed from the South Tours airport on five Blenheim aircraft.</p>
<p>8:00 PM: Landed in Hastings, England.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that a German motorcycle unit led the mechanized units into South Tours at midnight. (The End)</p>
<h3>Speech by Chairman Chiang at the 7th Anniversary Commemoration of the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Fellow compatriots, why do we advocate propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame? Everyone must know that the opposite of "propriety" is a lack of order, discipline, and rules; the opposite of "righteousness" is a lack of trustworthiness, responsibility, and duty; the opposite of "integrity" is a lack of right and wrong, public and private, and a lack of emphasis on moral character;</p>
<p>The opposite of "shame" is a lack of integrity, shame, and awareness. Therefore, we must correct these shortcomings to truly practice the "Four Cardinal Principles." Looking at our New Life Movement, why do we advocate neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, plainness, speed, and certainty? This is to fundamentally cure the greatest ills of our nation. Everyone must know that the opposite of "neatness" is</p>
<p>Chaos and Disorganization</p>
<p>The opposite of "cleanliness" is filth and corruption; the opposite of "simplicity" is complexity and cumbersomeness; the opposite of "plainness" is luxury and extravagance; the opposite of "speed" is slowness and apathy; the opposite of "certainty" is hypocrisy and deceit. If these six major ills can be completely eradicated, China's nation-building work will advance a thousand miles a day. It is precisely because we have not completely eradicated these six major ills that even though the soldiers and civilians on the front lines have achieved</p>
<p>Heroic Achievements</p>
<p>The social atmosphere and individual lives of our entire nation still cannot promote the success of the war of resistance and nation-building. I believe that the shortcomings mentioned above, as manifested in social vices, are nothing more than the four ugly things: opium, gambling, theft, and prostitution. As manifested in individual lives, they are nothing more than the four inferior qualities: extravagance, laziness, greed, and cowardice. We only need to think about what the Japanese are</p>
<p>Occupied Areas</p>
<p>The rewards are nothing but opium, gambling, theft, and prostitution, and we can know that these four are toxins that cripple the lives of our nation. We only need to think about the fact that anyone who is extravagant, lazy, corrupt, and cowardly, even if they do not sell out the country, will harm the country, and we can know that these four are the greatest evils that hinder our war of resistance and nation-building. In a nutshell, opium, gambling, theft, and prostitution are public enemies of social survival,</p>
<p>Extravagance, Laziness, Greed, and Cowardice</p>
<p>Are the great enemies of individual life. If we cannot use the spirit of great courage and forbearance to mercilessly eliminate these two internal enemies, then our society will be unable to survive, and individuals will never be able to become self-reliant. We have fought to this day and have the confidence to expel foreign enemies and achieve victory, but if we do not defeat these two internal enemies, even if we expel the Japanese army, our</p>
<p>Nation and People</p>
<p>Will still have no way out, and may even be doomed to the tragic fate of a semi-colony. I ask, how can we face the revolutionary martyrs, how can we face the soldiers and civilians on the front lines, how can we face the compatriots who are suffering and displaced? Therefore, I ask everyone not to treat the New Life Movement as something unrelated to the war of resistance and nation-building. You must know that this is truly related to our 450 million people</p>
<p>Life and Death</p>
<p>A major event that determines the fate of thousands of generations. The reason why I am saying this repeatedly is to make our compatriots understand this meaning, to practice the New Life with full determination, and to promote society and implement the New Life with full enthusiasm. Now is the beginning of the eighth year of the New Life Movement. I feel that</p>
<p>Past Work</p>
<p>Was not real enough, nor was it universal enough. I believe that from now on, we should pay special attention to the assessment of the New Life Movement. We should implement assessments universally in the New Life Movement branch associations of various provinces and cities and in organizations at all levels, to evaluate the merits and demerits of various achievements, and we must hold them regularly in batches and stages, using the method of competition, rewards, and punishments to encourage everyone to practice the New Life. As for the actual work of transforming society and changing the social atmosphere in the future, I would like to put forward four points to our compatriots today, hoping that we will pay attention to them together and implement them consistently. First, we must earnestly abstain from gambling. Gambling is entertainment in various countries and seems unremarkable, but in our country, it is truly the greatest shame of the nation. It is not only a symbol of national decline and corruption but also the greatest obstacle to national morality. Everyone only needs to see people who gamble together. Because of</p>
<p>Victory and Loss</p>
<p>They become face-to-face enemies who compete and fight with each other, even to family members and friends, due to differences in victory and loss. Some people criticize the widespread gambling in China as causing the national vice of jealousy and hatred. This is not without reason. Therefore, gambling not only wastes time and money but also harms the feelings of national compatriots and is the greatest thief of love and sincerity. From now on, the whole country, from top to bottom, must deeply recognize that gambling and the mutual love and help of the nation in the new era cannot coexist. Whether in the front or the rear, in families, schools, or organizations, we should persuade each other to stop gambling and completely eradicate it. We must take advantage of this time of war to sweep away what is common in</p>
<p>All Levels of Society</p>
<p>This most shameful and painful stain. Second, we must thoroughly eliminate opium. The government has repeatedly ordered the prohibition of opium and the rejection of drugs. On the sixth anniversary of the New Life Movement last year, I also made the elimination of opium as one of the main tasks. At the end of the year, when the six-year opium prohibition plan expired, I sent a telegram to the whole country, urging them to abstain. At present, the prohibition of planting, transporting, selling, and smoking opium in our rear provinces has been largely completed, but the occupied areas are implementing a policy of poisoning them. We in the rear should be even more painfully aware and jointly eliminate the remaining opium, and we must not allow it to revive and undo all our previous efforts due to lack of prevention. We must know that the compatriots in the occupied areas cannot even quit opium freely if you are determined to quit opium. This is truly a miserable situation where you cannot live or die. However, our nation must not sit still and wait for death. Therefore, I especially want to urge the compatriots in the occupied areas that no matter what, we need to treat opium,</p>
<p>With Hatred and Abhorrence</p>
<p>Resolve to quit, swear not to be tempted, and regard quitting opium as important as fighting on the battlefield. Our governments and leaders at all levels should regard eliminating the embers of opium as the central task of this year's New Life Movement, and must thoroughly enforce the laws. The people should also encourage each other and cooperate to report. As for the political and military authorities, after recovering every lost territory in the front, they should regard thoroughly prohibiting opium as the most important policy for comforting and reforming the people. We must remove this greatest scourge so that all unreasonable vices can be eliminated and the spirit of positive progress can be brought into play. (Telegraph from the 18th) (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee Reports on Domestic Economic Conditions: Strengthening National Defense and Actively Manufacturing Airplanes and Tanks; The Current War Is Actually a War for Stockpiling and Storing</h3>
<p>Moscow: The 18th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party continued its meeting yesterday. After the debate on Malenkov's report was concluded by 31 representatives, the Congress proceeded to discuss the second item on the agenda, a report by Voznesensky, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and Chairman of the State Planning Committee, on the state of the Soviet economy in 1940 and the development plan for the national economy in 1941. Voznesensky said that 1940 was a year of new progress for the Soviet Union. Neither the economic crisis in capitalist countries nor the imperialist war could prevent the development of the Soviet national economy. The Soviet economy is not affected by the current frenzy encountered by capitalist economies. Although the experience of this imperialist war is very important to us, technically and economically, the current imperialist war is a motor war. Motors require high technical standards, large quantities of oil, and non-ferrous metals. Regarding this aspect, the industry of the entire capitalist country is in adjustment. The current imperialist war is also a war of stockpiling. According to the war's sustainability, destructiveness, the collapse of the international small-capital system, and the distribution of labor, it shows the urgent need for stockpiling by the belligerent countries. The Soviet Union is paying close attention to the technical, economic, and other main points of this war and is taking appropriate steps to ensure that the national economy obtains advanced technology, and the country should also be in a state of preparation."</p>
<p>Making Military Supplies Without Spare Effort</p>
<p>Regarding the output of the Soviet Union and the United States, if the figures for both countries in 1929 were 100%, then the output of the United States in 1940 was 111%, while that of the Soviet Union was 534%. This is a typical example of the productive capacity of capitalism and socialism. The Soviet national economy has developed in all sectors. In the three years of the Third Five-Year Plan, the value of Soviet industrial products has increased from 95,500,000,000 rubles to 137,500,000 rubles, an increase of 44%. As for the output of the machinery manufacturing industry, it has also increased by 76%. As far as the national defense industry is concerned, no effort is spared in manufacturing aircraft, tanks, military supplies, and gunboats. (Omitted below) In short, the goals of the Soviet Union in 1941 are to: consolidate the independence of the Soviet national economy and avoid capitalist encirclement, so that it will not have to rely on capitalism economically (especially regarding machinery manufacturing and steel); continue to develop the socialist output of all sectors of the national economy; prevent uneven development of the national economy and possible failures caused by the development of new resources.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Unable to Blockade Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Several tanks and cavalry units have arrived in Nantou, proving that the Japanese army will have to garrison south of Danshui for some time. The number of Japanese warships along Dapeng Bay has increased to four, including one supply ship. It is reported that although the Hong Kong-Shaoguan highway has been closed, the cost of living in Shaoguan has not increased. The prices of motors, parts, gasoline, and oil may gradually increase in the future, but household appliances have not been affected. Although Japan has occupied the southern section of the Hong Kong-Shaoguan highway, it has not been able to completely blockade Guangdong Province, as there are other roads that can be used. Tungsten sand and tung oil, which were intended to be shipped to the United States via Daya Bay, are now being held in the interior, awaiting shipment. Chinese military authorities are still obtaining supplies of truck parts and gasoline via the Burma Road. It is said that this supply does not come from the Soviet Union.

<h3>Jardine Matheson's "Fu Sheng" Wheel Searched in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin: The "Fu Sheng" of Jardine Matheson has sailed from Tanggu to Shanghai last night after being unexpectedly detained for 24 hours. This is because a large number of currencies worth 50,000 yuan were found smuggled in the ship. Five gold bars, 8,000 Japanese yen, and 14,000 French currency were found in two different places and confiscated by customs officials. It is reported that the smuggler was a Chinese supervisor who has escaped. The bedrooms of the captain, first mate, and the luggage of the Chinese sailors were all inspected by Japanese soldiers at that time, but nothing was found. (Telegraph from Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>The United States Produced More Than a Thousand Airplanes Last Month</h3>

<h3>Overseas Japanese in Nanyang Discuss Situation in Shanghai: Australia Will Surely Assist Britain in Restraining Japan; 150 Japanese Nationals Evacuate to Return Home; Shanghai Japanese Newspaper Urges Residents to Prepare</h3>
<p>The Japanese ship Kashima Maru set sail from Mumbai, India, on January 29, carrying over 150 Japanese passengers returning to Japan. Many of them were evacuating due to the perilous situation in the Pacific. On its way, it was inspected by British authorities in Singapore for about three hours on the 9th of this month. It then continued its voyage and arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 19th), docking at the Pujiang wharf. Among the passengers were Mr. Takayama Sataro, a trader from Manila; Mr. Ogata Hiroshi, a responsible officer of a rubber company in Nanyang; Mr. Mori Haruki, an official from the Japanese Consulate-General in Manila; and Mr. Ayao Tsutomu, an employee of Ishihara Sangyo in Singapore. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Kobe on the 21st.</p>
<p>Australian People Fully Support Britain</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," a certain Japanese resident who studied at a school in Shanghai and has been doing business in Australia for three years, is now returning to Japan. He told reporters that neither Japan nor Australia would initiate a war against each other. However, if Britain goes to war with Japan, Australia will undoubtedly join the war. He left Australia on February 5 and traveled for a week in the Philippine Islands and the Dutch East Indies. He received fair treatment while traveling in the Philippines, but he felt unwelcome in the Dutch East Indies. The authorities there regarded and treated all Japanese residents as potential spies.</p>
<p>German Raider Engaged in Activity</p>
<p>Regarding the news of Nazi surface raiders operating in the Pacific, he heard from responsible parties before departing from Nanyang that a German surface raider shelled Nauru Island. The ship first flew the Japanese flag, but when it approached Nauru Island, it suddenly opened fire on several small ships in the harbor and then changed to the Nazi flag.</p>
<p>Australia Implements National Defense Training</p>
<p>As for Australia's attitude towards the European war, the Australian people are giving Britain their full support. However, Australia has not yet passed a conscription law to create an expeditionary force. Therefore, the Australian troops sent to Egypt, Palestine, and the Near East are all volunteers. At the same time, all Australian people are receiving national defense training, but the training period is only a few months, which is too short.</p>
<p>Entry of Japanese Nationals Now Extremely Strict</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, all communist organizations in Australia have been banned and are not allowed to hold meetings. Before this, communist groups in Australia were very active, but they suddenly disappeared after the German-Soviet pact was signed. Australia has tightened the enforcement of its immigration laws. Few Japanese people go to Australia unless they have direct trade relations with the country. According to current Australian law, Japanese people are not allowed to open stores or operate retail businesses in Australia.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Believes Crisis is Imminent</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "Continental Daily News" published an article urging Japanese residents in Shanghai to make active preparations to deal with the current situation. The article was titled "Urging Local Residents to Make a Resolution." The gist of the article was that the four-nation conference of Britain, the United States, Australia, and the Netherlands held in Washington, and the evacuation of residents from various places in the Far East by Britain and the United States, indicate a looming storm. However, it is extremely difficult to find a direct cause for war in the concrete facts. This move by Britain and the United States is undoubtedly an attempt to intimidate Japan, but it is a misconception to try to stop Japan's southward advance in establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, Japan must inform Britain and the United States of this determination. Japan is determined to work for world peace until the very last moment of war, but it will never yield to the pressure of Britain and the United States. Japan is fully prepared domestically, so it is hoped that the Japanese community in Shanghai will exert all its efforts in the spirit of the new system to cope with the current situation.</p>
<p>Record of the Trial of the Fangdan Land Case</p>
<p>Barrister Bolland Mistakenly Quotes the Book of Songs as a Good Story</p>
<p>The case of four Chinese landowners suing the Municipal Council for the collection of Fangdan land tax continued to be heard at the Consular Court in the conference room on the second floor of the Municipal Council yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Those present included Mr. Lang, secretary of the Consular Court; the plaintiffs Fang Jiaping, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, and Fang Wende; the defense lawyers Liu Shifang and Wang Jian; and the Municipal Council's defense lawyers Bolland and Ru Baoyi. The hearing lasted about two hours and adjourned around 4:00 PM. The case was adjourned to next Tuesday (the 25th) for further hearing.</p>
<p>Barrister Bolland Mistakenly Quotes the Book of Songs</p>
<p>In fact, Ru Baoyi, the Municipal Council's defense lawyer, sat on the witness stand because he was called as a witness by Barrister Bolland at the previous hearing. He presented various Chinese land laws and the Great Qing Code as evidence. Therefore, after yesterday's hearing began, Barrister Liu Shifang also severely questioned the points made at the previous hearing. Mr. Liu claimed that Barrister Bolland, the defendant's defense lawyer, had quoted a sentence from the ancient Chinese book "Mencius," "All the land under heaven belongs to the Emperor," claiming that the land of the Chinese people was all leased from the Emperor. The people did not have land ownership, so they should pay rent and taxes. Therefore, regardless of whether it was Fangdan land or Daoqi land, they should pay rent and taxes to the authorities according to this example. This statement is a misunderstanding because the saying did not come from Mencius, but from the Book of Songs, and in terms of meaning, it does not mean that the Chinese people do not have land ownership. Mencius was merely quoting the Book of Songs at the time as an expression of indignation.</p>
<p>Daoqi and Fangdan Are Clearly Different</p>
<p>He continued, "(1) The Daoqi land held by foreigners is marked as a perpetual lease, while the land certificates held by the Chinese are marked with the words 'ownership,' which means that the Consular Court also noted the word 'ownership' on the Fangdan in the English record of the Municipal Council at the last hearing of this case. (2) Barrister Bolland said that in the announcement of Landao Tai on February 24, 1855, it stated that Chinese people who rented land and built houses in the concession area had to pay rent and taxes. This refers to Chinese people who rented land from private concessionaires and had to pay rent, and it does not mean that land rented from the Emperor had to pay rent, nor is it related to the Fangdan land that needs to pay rent. However, Judge Fei Tang mistakenly translated Landao Tai's distance from private land rent to the land lease regulations that require land tax to be paid."</p>
<p>Proving that Land Guards Are Civil Servants</p>
<p>Recalling the previous hearing, Ru Baoyi claimed that the land guards were bad people and not civil servants. However, the land guard position of Zhu Ruiqing, one of the plaintiffs, was indeed appointed by the Land Bureau and has a letter of appointment as proof. Even if the Municipal Council purchases real estate, it must be stamped by the land guard to take effect. It can be seen that his position is not as Ru Baoyi said. Furthermore, Ru Baoyi also said that according to the Great Qing Code, the transfer and inheritance of Fangdan land must be registered for transfer, but it is not known where this is stated in the Great Qing Code. In fact, most of the Fangdan currently held were issued during the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty. Since no new Fangdan has been issued, there is naturally no need to register the transfer during transfer and inheritance.</p>
<h3>Splitting Fangdan Does Not Violate the Law</h3>
<p>As for Ru Baoyi's claim that splitting the Fangdan is illegal, this is also incorrect. A photograph of a split Fangdan appears in the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau's annual publication of the Republic of China in 1928, with a note below stating, "This is a split single. When the people sell a portion of the land on the original single, they cut off half or a corner of the single and hand it over to the owner to hold as proof of business." At the time, Barrister Liu also presented a copy of the Shanghai Special Municipality's municipal regulations and pointed out that Article 6 of the rules for the issuance of business licenses by the Shanghai Special Municipality Land Bureau, approved on July 3, 1929, states, "For old field singles that have been cut or divided, after verification, the hill number shall be assigned separately," which is proof that Fangdan can be split.</p>
<p>When Barrister Liu spoke eloquently in court, Barrister Bolland, the Municipal Council's defense lawyer, frequently tried to stop him from speaking, but Judge Lang allowed Mr. Liu to continue speaking without interruption until the court adjourned at 4:00 PM. Barrister Ru Baoyi did not offer any rebuttal from the start of the hearing to the adjournment.</p>
<p>Western Residents Advocate Fair Taxation</p>
<p>British resident Liddell wrote to the North-China Daily News yesterday, criticizing the current tax system of the Municipal Council, stating, in brief, that when Barrister Bolland, the Municipal Council's defense lawyer, defended the Municipal Council in the Consular Court's trial of the "Fangdan Land Case," he said that taxpayers should fairly bear taxes for the benefit of society and strongly criticized "the injustice of privileged classes being exempt from rent." The Municipal Council cannot tolerate such unfair facts. Bolland's words are very suitable for Fangdan land, why are they not suitable for owner-occupied land? I believe that the Municipal Council's Tax System Improvement Committee should pay close attention to this. The Fangdan case is of great importance. If the Municipal Council wins the case, its annual income can increase by more than one million yuan.</p>
<h3>A Small Number of American Missionaries Prepare to Return Home</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, the rumor that a large number of American missionaries will leave China is confirmed to be untrue. According to sources revealed by the authorities yesterday, only about 25 percent of American missionaries are preparing to return home in accordance with the State Department's advice, and about 5 percent will evacuate by the end of April. It is said that each of these missionaries can receive a considerable travel subsidy. Usually, about 20 percent of American missionaries return home on leave. According to a survey conducted this month (covering about 60 percent of church personnel in China), as of October 1, 1940, there were a total of 1,483 American missionaries in China. Since the U.S. announced the evacuation of nationals last year, about 329 people have left China as of February 10 this year. There are currently 1,154 missionaries remaining in China, and about 75 will leave China by the end of April, accounting for about 5 percent of the total. They are now preparing their luggage and waiting for ships to return home. It is estimated that there are about 329 American missionaries in the coastal areas of China, most of whom are in Japanese-occupied areas. Very few American missionaries are evacuating from Free China. There are about 200 missionaries in the interior of China, and only eight had left their posts as of February 10, some of whom had reached retirement age. When the State Department advised nationals to return home, six Presbyterian missionaries and one "American Church" missionary continued to serve as usual, even while on leave.</p>
<h3>"Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch" Was Bombed Yesterday; Three People Threw Four Bombs, One Exploded; Bodyguard Zhao Wanjun Shot in the Head and Killed</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the "Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch" at No. 15 Bund, Public Concession, was suddenly bombed. A total of four bombs were thrown, only one of which exploded. The bombers also opened fire with pistols near the stairs, resulting in the death of one bodyguard from a gunshot wound. In addition, one employee was cut in the face by shattered glass. The details of the case are described below.</p>
<p>Three Men Rush In and Throw Bombs</p>
<p>At around 10:15 AM yesterday, three middle-aged men suddenly entered the "Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch" at No. 15 Bund, Public Concession, one after another. One of them, dressed in a Western suit, drew out two grenades and threw them inside. One fell on the right side of the passageway inside the gate and did not explode, while the other fell at the entrance of the stairs and exploded immediately, causing damage to the walls and glass in many places. The staff in the counter were shocked at the time and fell to the ground, afraid to move.</p>
<p>Four Shots Fired, Bodyguard Killed</p>
<p>At the same time, another man went straight to the second floor and threw two military grenades. Because the fuses were not pulled, they did not explode when they landed. The man then turned around and went downstairs, where he met Zhao Wanjun (28 years old), a bodyguard from Zhenjiang, near the stairs. Zhao tried to stop him, but the man pulled out a pistol and fired four shots at Zhao. One bullet hit Zhao's head, penetrating his temple into his brain, and another bullet hit his chest. He immediately fell to the stairs.</p>
<p>Amidst the Chaos, Three People Escape</p>
<p>After the grenade throwers met, they discarded their weapons and escaped without a trace in the chaos. More than 30 Japanese military police stationed in the adjacent Bank of Communications also mobilized to guard the area. At the same time, police vehicles and a large number of Chinese and Western detectives dispatched by the police also rushed to the scene of the incident and cut off traffic in the surrounding area for a thorough search, but to no avail. The bodyguard Zhao Wanjun was sent to Renji Hospital, but he died before arriving at the hospital due to the critical gunshot wound. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination. When one bomb exploded at the entrance of the stairs, all the glass windows were shattered, causing glass shards to cut the face of employee Xue Hong, but he was not seriously injured. The police have summoned the male and female staff of the "Bank" for questioning and have taken the seized pistols and unexploded grenades back for inspection.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ship Chaumont Returned Home Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Mooring Time in Shanghai Less Than 24 Hours This Time</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy's 10,000-ton transport ship Chaumont, shortened its mooring time in Shanghai to less than 24 hours this time (this is the shortest time for a U.S. transport ship to moor in Shanghai), and left the British Navy pontoon in the Pujiang River slowly yesterday morning (the 20th) to return to the United States. About 105 U.S. Marine Corps members of the Fourth Marine Regiment, whose service in Shanghai has expired, all took the ship back to various ports on the east and west coasts of the United States. In addition, about 150 U.S. Marine Corps members stationed in Tianjin and Beijing, whose service in North China has expired, and U.S. Asian Fleet personnel whose service in the East has ended, also took the ship. The Chaumont will sail back to the United States via Manila, Guam, and Honolulu. Previously, U.S. transport ships would always stop in Shanghai twice each time they came to Asia. The first time was on the way from Manila to Qinhuangdao, stopping briefly at Wusongkou or Shanghai so that the personnel on board could disembark, and then proceeding to Qinhuangdao or Qingdao and Yantai as usual. On the way back, they would stop in Shanghai for about ten days, allowing the crew to disembark and enjoy themselves for a few days before crossing the Pacific back to the United States. However, this time the Chaumont did not follow this practice, but sailed directly from Manila to Qinhuangdao, and stopped briefly in Shanghai at 8:00 AM yesterday on the way back.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Arrives in Increasing Amounts, Rice Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Someone Is Manipulating Behind the Scenes, Which Cannot Be Explained by Common Sense</p>
<p>Today, due to the turmoil in the Pacific, rice merchants have taken the opportunity to stir up trouble, causing rice prices to exceed limits, making it more difficult for ordinary people to make a living. This week, imported rice has been arriving in Shanghai continuously. Yesterday, the market blindly raised rice prices by several cents because of rumors that a ship carrying flour from Australia was blocked in Hong Kong. The ship was carrying flour, so even if it was detained, what does it have to do with rice prices? Such illegal manipulation and monopoly is hated by all people. No wonder there are complaints from the outside about the fact that the price limit is getting higher and higher, and the rice arrivals are increasing, but the rice prices are rising, believing that it is a breach of trust. Yesterday, a Japanese ship, Blyo Maru, arrived directly from Yangon with more than 70,000 bags of rice, managed by Yamashita Kisen Co. It arrived at the port yesterday afternoon and stopped at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong to unload. From Monday to Wednesday this week, a total of 63,732 bags of imported rice arrived in three days. Including the 70,000 bags of rice brought by the Japanese ship yesterday, the total is a huge 133,732 bags. It is said that a large amount of rice will arrive in Shanghai in the coming days. Considering the prosperous source of imported rice, the rice price should not rise.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council's Japanese Deputy Secretary-General Teraoka Succeeds</h3>
<p>Municipal Council's Japanese Deputy Secretary-General Hideshiko Yubisuku is scheduled to retire at the end of this month. Secretary-General Philip held a farewell banquet for him at the Shanghai Club the night before last. As for the successor, Teraoka Kesshei, who works at the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai and was recommended by the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai, has been officially announced at noon yesterday. The Municipal Council has made a decision. Teraoka graduated from the Political Department of Tokyo University and then entered the Europe and America Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He has served in the Japanese embassies in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany. He was transferred to the Shanghai Consulate-General in August last year. It is now said that Hideshiko Yubisuku, the outgoing Japanese Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, believes that Teraoka has been in Shanghai for a short time and is unfamiliar with many of the Municipal Council's staff. He is scheduled to host a banquet for the important officials of the Municipal Council at the Hongkou Japanese Club at 6:00 PM on the 25th of this month to introduce Teraoka.</p>
<h3>Measures to Suppress Hoarding Have Been Ordered by the Ministry</h3>
<p>The National Government has promulgated measures to suppress hoarding, a total of 26 articles, which list the types of important daily necessities in detail and strictly stipulate the measures for punishment and reward for reporting. It is said that the relevant authorities in Shanghai have recently received the ministry's order to implement it earnestly. Ordinary legitimate merchants have expressed their support, but they hope that the government will clearly distinguish the limits of hoarding when actually applying these measures, and pay special attention to rewarding legitimate merchants in the crackdown on speculation, so as to ensure an uninterrupted source of goods. Those who are found to have solid evidence of hoarding should be severely punished in accordance with the promulgated measures.</p>
<h3>Dutch Ship Chizharlinka Will Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Java Mailboat Company's new mailboat Chizharlinka has already passed through Hong Kong and is coming to Shanghai, and will arrive at the port tomorrow (the 22nd). The Royal Company's South African line Tegel berg vessel has also sailed north and is expected to arrive at the port next Thursday or Friday.</p>
<h3>A Humble Opinion on the Urgent Need to Improve the Current Situation of the Public Concession (I)</h3>
<p>— Nash</p>
<p>Mr. Nash, the Acting Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, has served in the Bureau for 25 years and has recently resigned from the Bureau and is about to leave Shanghai. Based on his past experience and the current situation, he published an article in his personal capacity entitled "Humble Opinion on the Urgent Need to Improve the Shanghai Public Concession," which is a famous work after the "Fei Tang Report." It is now translated by the Dazhong News Agency and published in sections. Mr. Nash will leave Shanghai and return to China on the 25th of this month. We express our infinite admiration for his parting words. We wish Mr. Nash a happy future.</p>
<p>Although I advocate attaching importance to the strength of the sovereign powers of various countries in the Public Concession and their accurate historical estimates, the current happiness of the Public Concession is based on the independence of municipal policies and separation from the national policies of the countries concerned. This statement may seem self-contradictory at first hearing.</p>
<p>Ten Years of Tranquility</p>
<p>Since China was defeated militarily and politically by Britain in 1840, and British settlements were established until the First World War, the greatest power in the Public Concession was in the hands of Britain and the United States. From 1914 to 1925, Britain was weakened by the European War, and its control over the Public Concession was slightly weakened. At the same time, Japan's naval power in the Western Pacific expanded due to the opportunity of the European War, and its political power in China also increased. The United States, adhering to the policies of the Liberal Party and the Isolationists, tried to mitigate Japan's power and maintain the status quo, as shown in the Washington Treaty of 1922 and the liberal policy reported by Shidehara in China. All of this changed the control of the Public Concession. From 1914 to 1925, Britain's fatigue after the war, the United States' indifference, Japan's acquiescence, and China's powerlessness were enough to explain the interaction of various countries' policies in China, and the Shanghai Public Concession was the focus. These policies canceled each other out and maintained a balance, which finally enabled our municipal life to achieve ten years of tranquility.</p>
<p>Legitimate Aspirations</p>
<p>China's lack of power and influence in the municipal life of the Shanghai Public Concession came to an end in 1925, replaced by the power of the National Revolution, insisting that the Public Concession was a part of Chinese territory, and that its municipal life must conform to the national aspirations and speeches of the Chinese people, and that the Chinese people must not always be in a passive position. In the five years that followed, the trend of British and American policies in China, especially in the Shanghai Public Concession, was, as Chamberlain said in his Christmas memorandum in 1926, to constantly concede to China's legitimate aspirations. In the Public Concession, these aspirations are not consistent with traditional municipal policies and customs, and the method proposed by Judge Fei Tang is to translate this inconsistency into future harmonious Sino-foreign relations, through the "transitional era" and finally the "return of the concession" period.</p>
<p>Fei Tang Report</p>
<p>What the British and American expatriates in the Shanghai Public Concession considered "absurd" from 1925 to 1930 unexpectedly became a historical fact of the British and American governments' policies in China. The recommendations made by the Fei Tang Report regarding the improvement of the Shanghai Public Concession used this policy as a tool to revise the Yangjingbang land regulations, which were previously considered to be related to China's weakness, so that China would have a gradually increasing and ultimately surpassing power in all aspects of the municipal life goals and municipal policies of the Public Concession. Although the expatriates in Shanghai expressed an uncompromising attitude, the British and American governments had actually formulated this policy. The governments recognized the National Government established in Nanjing in 1928 as a progressive government in China, and the most enthusiastic political and commercial relations had developed between Britain and the United States. Such a government should be given the right to vote to Chinese citizens in the civil concession after preparing to abolish the consular jurisdiction treaty. For the sake of fairness, the municipal life of the Public Concession should have the greatest power occupied by the Chinese.</p>
<p>Different Policies</p>
<p>This is the policy of Britain and the United States, and this policy is very different from Japan's imperial policy. Japan believes that the legitimacy of China's national aspirations has not yet reached its time, and Japan's military power has greatly increased due to the opportunity of the world war. Some expatriates in Shanghai thought that Japan's purpose in China was the same as that of Britain and the United States, but this is a big mistake. Basically, Japan wants to make Britain and the United States submit to Japanese power in the Far East, and also make China do so. Japan and China are brothers in Asia, and Japan implicitly regards itself as the eldest brother. Japan's intention to call China brothers is to make Europe and the United States have no foothold in East Asia. Japan wants to see China strong in order to help it exclude Europe and the United States, but it does not want China to be too strong, lest Japan itself also be excluded.</p>
<p>Japan Concedes</p>
<p>From the Washington Treaty of 1923 to the Japanese army's invasion of Northeast China in 1931, Japan's concessions during this decade were only temporary. In fact, what represented Japan's diplomatic policy in China was Tanaka's "active" action, not Bihara's passive acquiescence. Although Japan made concessions in the Washington Treaty to maintain the balance of power of the British and American navies in the Western Pacific and the Chinese coast, it was not enough to represent the true spirit of Japan's foreign policy. To know the true face of Japan's foreign policy, it can be seen in the following event; that is, at that time, when the Western countries were engaged in the Great War, Japan put forward "21 Articles" of requirements to China, intending to swallow China in one go.</p>
<p>Excluding Europe and the West</p>
<p>I should insert a word here, that is, the purpose of this article is not to condemn the diplomatic policies of Japan or any country. I am only using objective facts to explain the inevitability of Japan's dual goals, that is, Japan wants to control China in its "geographical scope," while excluding the power of European and Western countries. Therefore, although Japan allows the powers to concede to China's legitimate aspirations and recognizes itself as neutral and reasonable, it sees its own role differently. Therefore, in the Shanghai Public Concession, where the elite of China gathers, Japan witnessed that the status of British and American rule gradually progressed to the power of the Chinese people, and could not help but be jealous, thinking that China's power would surpass Japan. In order to carry out its dual goals of simultaneously weakening the power of the powers and China, Japan at that time severely criticized the tolerance policy of the British and American policy towards China, believing that this policy violated the traditional policy of the Public Concession.

<h3>American Sails Small Yacht Across the Pacific Ocean: Journey from Shanghai to America Expected to Take Three Months; Sufficient Food for Half a Year Stored on Board</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports: Mr. Scheffer, a senior crew member of the American President Lines and a native of San Francisco, California, is fond of adventure. Last June, he designed and built a small yacht in Hong Kong, named "Cynjo." Accompanied by his wife and brother-in-law, he sailed the yacht from Hong Kong to Taiwan. In November, Mr. and Mrs. Scheffer arrived in Shanghai, preparing to sail the yacht across the Pacific Ocean. Yesterday (19th), Mr. Scheffer stated that he and his wife plan to lead a crew of four, setting sail from Shanghai within the month, taking the route through Honolulu to America. The journey is expected to take three months, but the yacht is stocked with enough food for half a year, and there are facilities for collecting rainwater to supplement the fresh water supply. The "Cynjo" is made of hardwood, 40 feet long, 25 tons in weight, with two sails totaling 1,100 square feet in area, two masts 58 feet and 48 feet long, and equipped with an auxiliary gasoline engine for use in ports and during departure.</p>
<h3>Shi Guqi Robbery Case: Bandit Leader Killed</h3>
<p>More than Ten Accomplices Arrested; Interrogation; Remanded for Further Investigation</p>
<p>The Shi Guqi antique shop at 70 Jiaotong Road was burglarized and robbed of antiques and cash worth approximately 200,000 yuan a few days ago. However, after the incident, Chief Detective Jiang Shangpei and Detective Ren Fengbiao of the Central Police Department obtained clues and arrested Sun Liansheng, Zhang Rongsheng, Shan Xiaoxin, Huang Daxing, Tang Jinpei, Liu Botang, Song Xueren, Jiang Weihuai, Hong Afu, Cheng Ruiting, Lu Linquan, Chen Guiqing, Chen Lu, Wu Yiren and others involved in the case at various locations, including Room 520 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road (the main culprit was at large at the time, so the information was not released). It has now been determined that the main culprit in this case, Zhang Xiong from Zhejiang, passed by the Da Guangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday morning. Officers waited for him, and when Zhang arrived, they approached and arrested him. Zhang resisted and was shot and captured by the detective. Yesterday morning, Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police department, informed the First Special Court that the suspect Zhang was in the hospital and could not be brought to court, requesting permission to remand him in custody for a joint trial with Sun Liansheng and others. Judge Feng granted the request.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was reported that at 10:05 a.m. the day before yesterday, near the Da Guangming Cinema on Jing'an Temple Road, the bandit leader of the Shi Guqi robbery case, using the alias Zhong Yongquan, was loitering in front of the cinema. He was ordered to stop by Detective No. 203 of the Central Police Department, but he refused. The detective fired a shot, hitting him in the chest, and he fell to the ground and was captured. He was immediately taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the bandit died yesterday afternoon at 3:30 p.m. due to the vital injury caused by the bullet.</p>
<h3>Meng Jiangnu Film Lawsuit: Appeal Judgement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Liu Zhonghao of Guohua Film Company previously entrusted Zhang Niankun as the company's representative to distribute films such as "Meng Jiangnu" in South China. Later, due to disputes over accounts, both parties filed a lawsuit in the First Special Court. The court ruled that Guohua should repay Zhang Niankun 1,800 yuan in national currency and 482.34 Hong Kong dollars, and confirmed that Zhang Niankun had a lien on the films "Meng Jiangnu," "Romantic Ghost," "Li Sanniang," and "New Hell" produced by the company. Both parties expressed dissatisfaction with the judgement. Zhang appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, engaging lawyers Lu Jun and Tang Juexian. Guohua Company also engaged lawyer Feng Xizui to appeal. The High Court found the case to involve complex and confusing accounts, and after several months of investigation, the case was finally concluded. Yesterday afternoon, the court ruled to modify the portion of the judgment regarding Guohua's repayment of 1,800 yuan in national currency to Zhang Niankun, ordering Guohua to repay Zhang Niankun 1,000 Hong Kong dollars. The appeals of Zhang Niankun and Guohua Company were otherwise dismissed.</p>
<h3>Peng Bowei Dies Yesterday</h3>
<p>Peng Bowei, an elderly Hunan man in his sixties, residing at 44 Le'an Lane, Avenue Joffre, was shot by thugs near the intersection of Rue Tenant de la Tour and Avenue du Roi Albert in the French Concession at 6:00 p.m. on the 17th of this month. He was shot in the back, and the assailants fled the scene. The French police sent Peng to Guangci Hospital for treatment while ordering detectives to investigate and arrest the fugitives. These details have been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that after Peng was admitted to the hospital, doctors performed surgery to remove the bullet. Unfortunately, his condition deteriorated, and he died yesterday at noon. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the morgue in the small ward of Taile Sidal Road. The police also notified the family, who claimed the body at 3:00 p.m. that afternoon and took it to the funeral home for embalming. The police are still diligently investigating the assailants.</p>
<h3>Wuhe Weaving Factory: Labor Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>The 300 to 400 employees of the Wuhe Weaving Factory at 120 Route Lafayette in the French Concession and the Jin Situ Temple branch factory on Connaught Road in the British Concession went on strike on the 19th because their request for an increase in the monthly rice subsidy was not met. According to a report from a Dagang News reporter yesterday, labor and management negotiated at the main factory on Route Lafayette at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. With the agreement of both parties, the rice subsidy was increased from 10 yuan to 14 yuan per month. Therefore, the labor dispute has been completely resolved, and all workers will resume work this morning.</p>

<h3>Donations to Puyutang Continue to Pour In Yesterday</h3>

His kindness and generosity in benefiting society are worthy of emulation. In addition, the Shanghai Office of the Red Cross Society and other organizations have also generously donated funds, which is admirable. Many readers have also called this newspaper, expressing their willingness to donate and to visit the Puyutang to appeal to their relatives and friends, so that the Puyutang can secure sufficient funds to prevent the interruption of its relief work.

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Finance: US Dollar Still Flowing Out; Market Fluctuations Remain Stable</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices showed no changes. Although the off-market prices for GBP/USD were flat, the trend remained weak. Speculators sold off approximately one million US dollars after making some purchases in the morning. The trading price for US dollars was mostly 5.65625 yuan in the morning, reaching 5.71875 yuan in the afternoon. Before the evening close, news of a non-aggression pact between Japan and the Soviet Union was reported, leading to varied speculation. The market saw a return to stability, and both GBP/USD closed flat. Only the forward US dollar strengthened by 0.03125. Based on the foreign exchange market situation, it is currently in a state of fluctuation. However, Corley's trip to Chengdu and his imminent return to the US will be beneficial and harmless to the Chinese foreign exchange market. The British pound has lost its importance in Shanghai's market compared to the US dollar. Therefore, only the US dollar saw inflows and outflows. Moreover, savings deposits in US dollars not only do not earn interest, but may also require depositors to pay handling fees. In short, this action will not be detrimental to US dollar depositors.</p>
<p>US Dollar Fluctuates Slightly</p>
<p>Initially, long and short-term London exchange rates both rose by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat, and the London gold price was stable. Foreign exchange rates between GBP/USD and Shanghai were flat. USD fell by 0.025 against GBP, slightly against Shanghai by 0.08 points, and there was no trading against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the bank's opening this morning, the spot selling price was 3 pence 4.46875 for GBP and 5.65625 yuan for USD, which was flat for GBP and down 0.03125 for USD compared to the previous day's evening close. After opening, speculators bought slightly, but foreign banks supplied generously, so the market was firm. The settlement price for US dollars for this month for speculators was 5.65625 yuan, and for February it was 5.59375 yuan. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax increased by 0.50%. Afterwards, market sentiment suddenly loosened due to a bomb somewhere. Speculators switched from buying to selling, selling to an American bank. The US dollar price for next month was quoted at 5.65625 yuan, and for this month it reached 5.6875 yuan. However, by noon, the selling pressure had subsided, and the market returned to stability. The closing price for spot US dollars was 5.65625 yuan, and for GBP it was 3 pence 4.453125. The initial outlook for the market showed no major changes. It was reported that Huaxing Shanghai had paid American banks for US dollars for this month at a price of 5.65625 yuan. Soon after, speculators began to sell aggressively, and there were many negative rumors, so the February US dollar reached 5.71875 yuan, and the March US dollar also traded at 5.6875 yuan. Before the close, there were rumors of a treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, which caused the market to recover slightly. As a result, the spot and current month's US dollar closed at 5.6875 yuan, GBP at 3 pence 4.46875, and the next month's US dollar at 5.65625 yuan. GBP at 3 pence 4.45125, with no difference between the spot and forward GBP rates compared to the previous day, and only a 0.03125 increase in the forward US dollar.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Fluctuates</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 10th (Thursday) - The exchange market opened erratically this morning. There were no gains or losses for either GBP or JPY. The spot US dollar sharply contracted by 0.125 to 24.5 yuan. The spot Shanghai dollar rose by 2.5 yuan to 434 yuan. At 11:30 a.m., the spot Shanghai dollar fell back by 1 yuan to 433 yuan, while the rest remained unchanged. The market opened flat at 2:30 p.m. The spot Shanghai dollar rose by 1 yuan to 434 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rate Falls Slightly</p>
<p>Tianjin, 20th (Thursday) - The exchange market opened sluggish this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate remained unchanged, still opening at 3 pence 8.8125. The renewal telegraphic transfer rate was 0.0625 higher at 6.25 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 0.25 yuan to 90.05 yuan. The "Joint Note" off-market price rose slightly by 0.1 yuan to 81 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Tries to Rise but Falters; Spot Price Raises Around 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Haxia off-market trading has made buyers even less interested. The early morning rise had reached 6,170 yuan, but later it went downwards, hovering between 6,000 yuan and 6,100 yuan. There was a risk of re-entering the 6,000 yuan mark. The offshore market after the previous day's close was very expensive, so the opening price was 6,000 yuan. However, after the "Reserve Branch" was bombed, market sentiment fell, and Gonghe, Chengji, De and other companies aggressively sold, falling back to 6,020 yuan. By the time the market closed at noon, it was still 6,082 yuan. The market once hardened to 6,100 yuan, but when new Fengyong, Ren Chengyong, and Mingfeng came to sell due to the continuing rise of foreign exchange rates, it fell to 6,010 yuan. The closing result was 6,035 yuan, down 50 yuan from the previous day. The current market spot price was 420 yuan higher than the futures price in the morning. It was heard that transactions at 380 yuan had occurred in the afternoon. The total daily transaction was about 10,000 taels. The price of silverware stabilized, and the price of Guan Jin etc. was flat.</p>
<p>Haxia Falls 50 Yuan</p>
<p>The offshore market insisted after the previous day's late close. Although various parties had no intention of buying more, the selling had stopped. Therefore, the opening price was 6,120 yuan, 35 yuan higher than the previous day. The market was quite active after the opening, and the buying was very strong, continuing to rise and reaching 6,170 yuan. After the aforementioned incident was reported, market sentiment relaxed imperceptibly, and it was considered a selling opportunity. At one time, there was a wave of selling, with Gonghe, Chengji, and Defu being the most active sellers. Although other silver companies absorbed some, they were ultimately unable to resist the crowd and fell to 6,020 yuan. At that time, there was concern that it might enter the 6,000 yuan mark, but Da Feng, Hesheng, and others vigorously bought to stop the decline and rose back to 6,100 yuan. However, the silver companies turned to selling again, and Tong Kangyong and others came to sell, causing the market to fall back to 6,035 yuan. At this time, Da Feng, Hengji, and others suddenly had the intention to buy, and took the opportunity to search and buy at a low price, pulling it up 40-50 yuan. The market closed at 6,090 yuan before the close, and the final result was 6,082 yuan, down 50 yuan from the previous day. There were many customers limiting the price in the afternoon, so it was pressed to 6,050 yuan. However, it hardened, and Hesheng, Yida, Tong Kangyong and others were willing to buy, pushing it to 6,100 yuan. However, the foreign exchange rate was reported to be rising, so the selling pressure rose sharply. New Fengyong, Ren Chengyong, Mingfeng, and others sold a lot, and it actually fell to 6,010 yuan. Because retail investors held on, the closing was still at 6,035 yuan, down 50 yuan from the previous day. The daily fluctuation was 160 yuan. The selling price of the current brand gold of the cash shop was more than ten yuan higher than Haxia (spot), and the purchase price was forty yuan lower. The current standard gold was lower than the listed price by fifty to sixty yuan, and the transactions were rarely opened.</p>
<p>Silverware Returns After Rising</p>
<p>The selling price of silverware and jewelry was listed at 670 yuan per tael at 9:25 a.m., and then fell by 10 yuan at 11:20 a.m., and remained unchanged thereafter. It is estimated that Datonghang, Xinhang, and others have all suspended 660 yuan, and the purchase is about 40 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Still in High Demand</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign currency market, although Haxia market prices were weak, the prices of British and American gold pounds rose because of the high cash price, while the price of British gold notes remained stable. The market price of US dollar notes initially reached 17.55 yuan, but eventually fell to 17.3 yuan, down 0.1 yuan from the previous day. The supply of Hong Kong notes was abundant, and the market price was weak. There was demand for Singapore notes and Annam, Roby, and Philippines notes, and the market prices all rose uniformly. The supply and demand for Japanese and Korean gold notes was equal, and the market price was stable. The former remained at 1.74 yuan, and the latter remained at 1.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Oilcake Manipulation Has Many Twists and Turns</h3>
<p>The oilcake market yesterday was still within the scope of speculation, but its excitement has slightly reduced. However, the trend of the day had many twists and turns. Previously, the market price rose wave after wave in a tense atmosphere, but later the selling pressure turned strong, and it was a downward trend. In short, those who make a fortune from national difficulties all take the purpose of getting the money. Therefore, its changes are even more profound. Yesterday, the result was that current soybean oil rose slightly by 0.25 yuan, peanut oil rose by 0.5 yuan, and peanut oil fell by 2 yuan. A Hong Kong comprador went to Jiaozhou for 1,200 pieces at a price of 105 yuan. Soybean oil only opened 180 barrels of Dalian current oil and 700-800 barrels of futures oil. Soybean cake inland and Hong Kong compradors went to current cake for more than 5,000 pieces, and other futures cake totaled about 40,000 pieces. The market price rose by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. On the 21st, 555 bags of soybeans were exported to Xiamen, 1,025 bags to Hong Kong, 3,440 bags to Singapore, 6,000 pieces of soybean cake to Xiamen, 1,800 pieces to Hong Kong, 100 bags of peanuts to Singapore, 310 tins of sesame oil to Xiamen, and 630 tins to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Miscellaneous Litchi Weak</h3>
<p>Although the arrival of miscellaneous litchi in the market is scarce, the market stock is still not thin. Therefore, the trend is very weak. In addition, the sales of each helper are narrow, making it more difficult to turn around. Therefore, the recent market price has dropped by 5-10 yuan. Only the sales in Hangzhou are more active.</p>
<h3>Cinchona Tree</h3>
<p>By Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The Cinchona tree is a tall, evergreen tree about seventy to eighty feet high on the Le Quinqui Mountains. Its leaves are ovate, opposite, and glossy. It bears small white flowers with tubular corollas in conical panicles. Its bark contains a white, needle-like crystal with an extremely bitter taste and is an effective treatment for malaria. This is where the medicinal name Cinchona "frost" comes from. The name cinchona is derived from the native South American word for "skin of skin." Its Latin name is Cinchona, named after the Countess Cinchone, wife of the Viceroy of Peru. The Countess contracted malaria in Peru in the early seventeenth century. Following the advice of a Jesuit priest, she took the so-called "Jesuit powder" and made a complete recovery. This powder was made from the bark of the Cinchona tree. The Countess returned to her home country of Spain in 1632 and brought the Cinchona medicine to Europe for the first time. People named the medicine after her name. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Grain: Over 70,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive in Shanghai; Forward Contract Traders and Hoarders Still Dominate the Market</h3>
<p>A large batch of foreign rice has arrived in Shanghai. The Blyo Marn of the Japanese shipping company Yamashita Kisen Kaisha has brought over 70,000 bags of foreign rice from Yangon (yesterday's report incorrectly stated Saigon). It has arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and is unloading at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong. It is said that a large shipment will arrive within a few days.</p>
<p>Foreign rice was seen to be strong yesterday morning. Since new forward contracts have not yet arrived, the forward contracts that have been negotiated in recent days are difficult to confirm. It is also rumored that one or two batches have been cancelled due to a lack of ships. Therefore, although the market has lacked stimulus due to the easing of international tensions, the excitement of buying has not diminished. Moreover, since general high-quality goods have already reached the price limit and the authorities are strictly limiting prices, those who hold goods are unwilling to sell when they hear that the Hong Kong telegraphic rate is rising. As a result, high-quality goods are scarce in the market. Under the lack of goods available for purchase, general customers have turned their attention to mid-grade goods. At one time, the sales of mid-grade goods became brisk, and sellers took the opportunity to push up prices. The market became tighter than before. The situation did not diminish until the close, and the closing price was again raised by one yuan. The first grade West Guanzhong was 85-84.5 yuan, the second grade was 80 yuan, the first grade Siamese was 85 yuan, the next was 83 yuan, the fire-roasted was 84 yuan, the small roasted was 76 yuan, the rice was 73 yuan, and the broken tip was 67-64.5 yuan. Forward contracts also took the opportunity to push up prices, so the forward contracts for each month were raised by 0.5-1 yuan. The first grade Saigon February-March opened at 96.5 yuan, and the forward contracts were 98-98.35 yuan. The current small roasted rice was 90.05 yuan, 91 yuan, and 91.5 yuan, and February was 88 yuan, 88.35 yuan, and 89.1 yuan. The lower part of February to the beginning of March was 89-89.5 yuan. There were also 600-700 tons of transactions. Over 10,000 bags of current rice were opened.</p>
<p>Due to sunny weather, the source of thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice continues to flow in, resulting in oversupply. The selling price continues to depreciate by 0.5 yuan. Kunshan Yuanjing opened at 107.5-107 yuan, and the price of Hejian was 103.5-102 yuan. Qingjiao Baodao Hejian was 99.5-99 yuan.</p>
<p>With major companies hoarding, the sales of glutinous rice have become smooth, and the market price has risen by 0.5 yuan along with the foreign rice due to the small amount of rice on the market. Hong Kong special was opened at 83.5 yuan, and ordinary was 82.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Remains Tense</h3>
<p>The flour market did not escape the tense situation yesterday. Although the flour companies and warehouses have supplies, they cannot be cashed out immediately. Therefore, the demand for foreign flour is still urgent. Moreover, in the high rice price environment, speculators and hoarders all have unexpected desires. The total market price for Linglou brand flour was 25.55 yuan, and for Jinlong brand flour was 24.5 yuan. About 10,000 bags were transacted. It is said that there are still 300,000-400,000 bags of foreign flour on the way, which will arrive at the end of the month and the beginning of the month. However, there are frequent obstacles along the way at present, and there is a risk of interruption at any time, so the market is still strong.</p>
<p>The source of wheat is still quiet. The foreign wheat ships have been damaged on the way and will be delayed for another week or ten days. The price of domestic Du wheat is also high, and few goods arrive. Although the factories have a strong need for raw materials, they regret that there are no goods to buy. It is said that the price of wheat in the concession is approaching 40 yuan, with dozens of bags being sold by this street office. The rest of the trading is as usual.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Have Buying Interest</h3>
<p>The off-market price of government bonds continued to advance yesterday. The buyers were all strong and still interested in buying. For example, Xinfu Company has been buying continuously for many days and still has no intention of stopping. Maoda's buying is another new force. At this price, there must be an organization, and a huge change in the future is inevitable. However, only raising the price of Class C bonds shows a weakness. Let's see what happens later. Yesterday morning, Xinfu alone entered more than 400,000, and Lianhe, Hongda, Yongkang, Tongsheng and other companies also bought a lot. Tongkang has already been released, and Dade and Hengfu have also sold a lot. Xinfu raised the opening price to 66 yuan, fearing that it might fall. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to drag another 200,000-300,000, and Hengkang followed suit. The opening price was once raised to over 6 yuan. Hongda, Tongkang, and Hengfu sold, and it once fell back to 5.7 yuan. Near the close, Maoda suddenly had an appetite for 300,000, and the market price was raised to over 6 yuan again. At that time, the sellers were only Lianyi, Yizhong, Lianhe and Shengchang, which were not enough to resist. Therefore, the resulting increase was not uniform. Most rose by 0.5-0.8 yuan, while Class C bonds alone rose by 1.05 yuan, indicating that the price increase was only focused on one type. The turnover was about 2.5-2.6 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>The transaction of 30 shares of Sanyou Industrial Society shares was transacted at a price of 24 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Wednesday) - Today's listed market prices for Chinese foreign debts and Far East company stocks remained flat. Only the price of the Mercantile Bank shares fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence to £7 and 15 shillings. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Flowers: Cotton Yarn Falls and Rises; Cotton is Not in Demand</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to see increases, but the trend is still uncertain. This is because people are unsettled, and speculators are constantly entering and exiting the market with large sums, causing fluctuations. Actual sales have improved slightly, but large transactions are still hindered by transportation difficulties and inability to purchase in bulk. 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 1,298 yuan at its highest and 1,255 yuan at its lowest. In the afternoon, it started at 1,268 yuan, fell to 1,264 yuan, and ended at 1,266 yuan. Today, 1,040 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, continuing the strong momentum from the previous afternoon. There were more buyers than sellers in the market, creating a tight situation. The initial price was 1,280 yuan, rising slightly to 1,283 yuan. Bull traders then sold, causing the price to fall to 1,271 yuan. At this point, smaller companies entered the market, driving the price up to 1,298 yuan. However, as the price rose, rumors spread, and the bid price suddenly dropped by 100 yuan. This triggered a sharp decline in the market, with shouts of selling echoing. The price plummeted to 1,255 yuan. Subsequently, those who had profited covered their positions, pushing the price back up to 1,274 yuan. The closing price was 1,268 yuan. The total transaction volume for the half-day was 9,150 bales. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 475 bales; Inland: 5 bales</p>
<p>Ningbo: 12 bales; Fellow Traders: 7,650 bales</p>
<p>Total: 9,150 bales</p>
<p>The current cotton situation is relatively quiet because the yarn market is more stable, but demand from factories is weak, so the overall trend remains flat.</p>
<p>New York cotton cloth market conditions are quiet and mixed. Due to buying by fellow traders and short covering, prices suddenly rose. As a result, the closing prices were higher than the previous day by up to eight points. Indian cotton was slightly weak, with predictions of a decline.</p>
<p>Spot cotton trading in Shanghai was generally quiet. Because the yarn market seemed to be firming and foreign exchange rates were stabilizing, there were a few spot cotton transactions yesterday.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Speculative Market Causes Disorder in the Cloth Market</h3>
<p>The cloth market yesterday was stable, because actual transactions were sluggish. Inventories of cotton cloth are too high, and sentiment is weak, so sellers are unable to raise prices. For some white goods, fine cloth and twill increased by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece, and coarse cloth increased by 2.5 jiao per piece. Quotations for bleached and dyed cloth varied. Small amounts were still sold at the original price. Sales at retail stores on the street increased slightly due to the sudden clear weather, with a small amount of restocking. Transactions with out-of-town merchants were sparse. Shipments to Fujian and Zhejiang were intermittent. Although transportation to Hong Kong was smooth, purchases were weak. Yesterday, over 100 pieces of twill-colored cloth and coarse cloth were sold. Today, 48 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Xiamen, 375 pieces to Hong Kong, and 135 pieces to Singapore.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Rose sharply and fell quickly, fluctuations remained significant. In the white goods Dragon Head fine cloth market, the morning price rose to a maximum of 45.3 yuan, then fell back to 42.8 yuan. The market then rebounded to 44.25 yuan, but ultimately declined to 43.67 yuan due to sluggish actual sales. As a result, the closing price was about 5 jiao higher per piece than the previous day. However, futures were a different story. On the exchange, the current month was driven up to 45.3 yuan due to a short squeeze, matching the closing price for March.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat, fluctuating by only two or three jiao. The guild's cleared price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 81.5 yuan at the warehouse. There were more transactions of spot and futures outside the warehouse, initially at 80.8 to 80.9 yuan, then rising to 81.1 to 81.24 yuan, and then slightly easing to 81.1 to 81.2 yuan. Old Dutch red sugar was 61.5 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar B mark was 80.5 to 80.7 yuan at the warehouse, DY mark was 79.75 yuan at the Western warehouse, and HX mark was 79.2 to 79.5 yuan, all rising by two or three jiao. Yesterday, 3,200 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Fish Maw is Expensive</h3>
<p>Recently, fish maw has been increasingly expensive as sources have become difficult and inventories have thinned. The market is strong, with high-grade products such as Guangzhou fish maw selling for 1,500 yuan, followed by hanging slices at 700 yuan, king slices at 640 yuan, and long glue at 3,200 yuan.</p>

<h3>Unified Enrollment for Public Universities and Colleges Suspended This Year; Ministry of Education Instructs Institutions to Conduct Their Own Enrollment</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 20th Dispatch) Due to transportation difficulties in various regions, the unified enrollment for public universities and colleges this year has been suspended for one year. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has stipulated measures for public universities and colleges to conduct their own enrollment for the 30th year of the Republic (1941), instructing all public institutions to comply.</p>
<h3>Guangxi Province Advocates Special Ethnic Group Women's Education</h3>
<p>Special Teacher Training School Enrollment</p>
<p>(Guilin Air Dispatch) Guangxi Province is advocating education for special ethnic groups, ensuring that children of the Miao, Yao, Zhuang, and Yi groups have access to schooling. However, education for women of these groups is still lacking. The provincial government recently received a report from Liu Jie, the director of the Provincial Special Education Teacher Training School, stating that the lack of education is the reason for the undeveloped intellect and backward customs of these groups. According to recent inquiries, students have said they are willing to bring their sisters and relatives to study. They have even requested this from the director. It is believed that these hundreds of thousands of special ethnic group women, under our government, should not be excluded from education. It is proposed to recruit a preparatory class for special ethnic group women's elementary teachers in the spring of this year, requesting approval. The provincial government has approved this and instructed each county to select students. According to the school's enrollment guidelines, the class will have 50 students selected from the Miao, Yao, Zhuang, Yi, and other special ethnic groups in each county. The enrollment date is March 1. Training will be conducted separately from existing male students, with a multi-grade teaching system based on their proficiency level. The preparatory class will last one to two years. Students who pass the examination at the end of the program will be promoted to the school's elementary normal department. After enrollment, the school will provide food, lodging, and books, as well as a mosquito net, cotton quilt, padded quilt, bed sheet, straw mat, and cotton clothing. Each semester, students will receive a stipend of one yuan and five jiao in national currency for shoes, socks, leather shoes, stationery, and paper.

<h3>Bear to Teach the Children to Hide Their Smiles?</h3>
<p>— A Question —</p>
<p>—A Visit to the New Puyu Hall—</p>
<p>On a bitterly cold afternoon, this reporter made the first visit in over three years since the end of the war to the New Puyu Hall. It was unexpected that in the war-torn zone, there could be such a perfect orphanage. The scene of ruins and debris contrasted sharply with the New Puyu Hall, which houses orphans, the elderly, and the disabled. They are like spring grass growing in rubble, needing nourishment and cultivation to thrive in the harsh environment. I will describe what I saw and felt below, as a report from the sidelines to the readers. Beyond the duty of reporting, it contains a sincere call for help.</p>
<p>Environment</p>
<p>On a vast field of over 120 acres, European-style buildings are nestled among lush trees. It houses a nursery, orphanage (divided into boys' and girls' sections), disability home, nursing home, mental asylum, housing for widows and widowers, free clinic, and a volunteer school. Each section has a lounge, classroom, pharmacy, and bedroom, and is managed by a nun responsible for education and care. The most commendable aspect of the facility is the attention to hygiene. Even in the dead of winter, each person must bathe once a week. Those who fall ill are immediately taken to the infirmary and isolated. Secondly, the bedrooms are clean, with neatly arranged iron beds and spotless white bedding. In terms of facilities, the hall could accommodate two or even three times as many orphans, elderly, and disabled people as it currently does. However, due to a lack of funds, it struggles to maintain its current state. Therefore, the hall's leaders have to painfully abandon many needed relief efforts and focus on educating and caring for the existing orphans. The excellent environment and facilities can only be used to expand the intake in the future.</p>
<p>Education and Care</p>
<p>Charity work should involve both education and care to enable orphans to stand on their own in society in the future. The New Puyu Hall pays great attention to this and puts it into practice. The nursery is equipped with educational toys for young children to play with, bringing smiles to their faces. The older orphans study at school for four hours each day. The girls, in addition to studying, are also taught sewing and embroidery. Even the elderly in their sixties and those who are disabled receive literacy education every day. They also do light manual work, such as sewing buttons, knitting gloves, and making paper flowers. This income, though small, helps to offset some of the hall's expenses. The supervising nuns are from Belgium, and their homeland has also fallen into tragic circumstances. Yet, they remain committed to the cause here and persevere in the face of hardship. The deputy head nun is Chinese and has served at the New Puyu Hall for nearly 30 years, earning the love and respect of all. All the nuns have a belief in love, sacrifice, and saving the world, serving the orphaned and suffering, treating the orphans like their own children and the elderly like their own elders. Their warmth is like that of a family.</p>
<p>Looking Back</p>
<p>Looking back, listening to the nuns recount the past is like reading a glorious history. In fact, it is a glorious history. Just look at the majestic buildings, the perfect facilities, and the astonishing number of orphans and sick people who have been cared for over the years, and you can imagine the great achievements of the founders and the continued dedication of their successors. When the Chinese army retreated from the west and Nanshi was occupied, the nuns evacuated the hall's residents day and night, settling them safely in the Luban Road area. The local poor, unable to care for both the old and the young, abandoned their young children and even infants at the hall. After the gates of the French Concession were closed, hundreds of children cried amidst the sounds of artillery fire and bombs. Some died of fright, some died of illness, and some died of starvation. It was not until after repeated negotiations that the nuns arrived. Only one child was still barely alive; all the others had died. What a tragic event! The rescued child is now three or four years old and lives with the other children who have been taken in. But now, they face a food shortage, and the lives of these children are once again threatened. The leaders cannot bear to see this tragedy repeated, so they are doing their best to maintain the situation and are making this plea.</p>
<p>Looking Ahead</p>
<p>This reporter personally experienced it, seeing the orphans living an orderly life, each small face showing an innocent smile; the elderly and disabled also living peacefully, enjoying their final years. This status quo needs to be supported by people in society. In other words, the New Puyu Hall has no fixed funding and is facing the abyss of despair in this time of expensive food. The hall's future, and thus the future of the orphans, elderly, and disabled, can only be hoped for with the support of people in society. The hall has educated and cared for countless orphans, the girls marrying after their selection, completing their responsibilities, but now even daily provisions have become a problem. Such a complete future is difficult to talk about; can people in society bear to see their education and care abandoned halfway, the lives of children cut short? As I write this, the smiles on the faces of the orphans reappear before my eyes. Children do not understand, how would they know a food shortage is imminent? However, can the people in society "bear to teach the children to hide their smiles?" We all feel unhappy when our own children are unhappy, but we should also know that there are countless orphans without parents who are about to fall into despair, not only losing their smiles forever, but also their lives. How should we give them what they need, like satisfying the desires of our own children? Looking ahead for the orphans, we only hope that this appeal will receive an enthusiastic response from readers, doing their utmost to help this group of pitiful orphans, the elderly, and the disabled.</p>

<h3>A Cute Little Treasure</h3>
<p>— Big, Abide by the Rules</p>
<h3>Big, Abide by the Rules</h3>
<h3>The Sacred Mission</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>After the fall of Greater Shanghai, some enthusiastic people in society formed refugee shelters, while others established reformatories for the destitute. They ran around appealing and calling out for the unfortunate compatriots, advocating for their lives. Their enthusiasm is commendable, and their spirit is admirable! However, like a fleeting epiphyllum, it didn't last long. Refugee shelters, struggling with financial difficulties, sent refugees back to their hometowns one after another. Even more tragically, some charitable organizations saw corruption cases. In these three years, indeed, the "isolated island" saw a distorted development that made shortsighted people forget the pain of reality. However, unfortunate incidents such as corruption cases were also among the reasons that hindered various charitable undertakings.</p>
<p>Now, in a corner of Nanshi, there is such an orphanage, a paradise for the old and weak. Under the arduous efforts of nuns with a spirit of sacrifice and salvation, it has been sustained for so long and has already achieved good results. Who doesn't have parents? Who doesn't have children? After reading the preceding "Visit to the New Pu Yu Tang," we should reflect and feel ashamed. Reflect – we have taken the wrong steps; Ashamed – this was originally our responsibility!</p>
<p>According to the record of this newspaper's local news two days ago, they need 16,000 yuan per month. Apart from the regular income of 6,000 yuan, there is a shortfall of 10,000 yuan. Calculated annually, it is only 100,000 yuan. Given the fluctuations in the economic market, a week's loss is 10,000,000 yuan. The amount of 100,000 yuan is even more insignificant. I hope people from all walks of life, for themselves, for their children and grandchildren, for the country, and for the nation, will complete this sacred mission.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"According to Director Ma, this was what Garrison Commander Yuan personally took a fancy to on the day you held your fifth-anniversary celebration," Father added in explanation.</p>
<p>Although Xiangqi saw a few soldiers sitting in the guest seats on that day, she would never have imagined that the fattest one with the worst attitude was the Garrison Commander Yuan who intended to swallow her up.</p>
<p>"About how old is he?" After struggling for a long time, she couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"Actually, he's only in his thirties," Mother rushed to answer.</p>
<p>"Thirties?" This was greatly beyond Xiangqi's expectations. She remembered that the ages of the few soldiers she saw were at least in their forties. "It's best to have Dad get a picture to look at first."</p>
<p>Mother seemed to think it was too much trouble, and said in a very heavy voice:</p>
<p>"Child, the matter is...certainly...good....First...their...bride price...sent...here, your elder brother's medical...expenses...won't be a worry...You...why...be...undecided?"</p>
<p>But Father agreed with Xiangqi's suggestion.</p>
<p>A little over a week later, Mr. Luo brought back two things from Director Ma: one was a picture of a man in his thirties, wearing plain clothes, with a very thin appearance; the other was a letter of appointment as a staff member of the Second Section of the Department of Education.</p>
<p>Xiangqi stared at the photo for a long time and said very suspiciously.</p>
<p>"This person seems to be someone I didn't see that day."</p>
<p>"Maybe wearing military uniform and wearing plain clothes are a bit different, but it's definitely not fake!" Father explained from the side.</p>
<p>The matter was decided like this.</p>
<p>Forty days later, with Governor Hu as the witness, a wedding ceremony similar to a farce was performed in the largest restaurant in Tianjin. The most magical thing was not this wedding, but the fickle groom: the one in the photo was originally a man in his thirties with a delicate appearance; in less than two months, he had become a man in his forties, tall and fat, half like an ox and half like a fierce tiger.

<p>The Entertainment World</p>
<h3>"The Three Mesquiteers"</h3>
<p>— Cheng Bingnu</p>
<p>Starring in "The Three Mesquiteers" are Kay Kyser, Peter Lorre, Boris Karloff, George Zucco, and Helen Parrish, etc. Kay Kyser is an American radio broadcasting star. His "appearance" is very much like Roque, except that his mouth is fluent, but his acting is really not very brilliant. However, this man is exceptionally hardworking, and quite a few people like him. Although Peter Lorre is full of acting skill, there isn't much acting to be done in "The Three Mesquiteers." Karloff and Zucco are similarly in insignificant positions. "The Three Mesquiteers" and all of that, at first glance, seems unusually stimulating, but it's really just so-so.</p>
<p>The story of "The Three Mesquiteers" probably got too unreasonable for the sake of being too stimulating. The three demons wanted to seize Helen Parrish's property, first using ghosts and monsters to frighten her, and then trying to put her to death, but the methods were very clumsy. Kay Kyser is a broadcasting star who was invited to her house to sing at Helen's birthday party, and the bizarre legends surrounding the three demons in the house were finally broken.</p>
<p>Apart from this nonsensical story, the whole play is not without its merits, which is the thickness of the atmosphere of terror. The director used sound effects and deliberately created a sense of mystery to make the audience shiver. For example, when Zucco cast spells, the lights in the house went out, ghosts wailed, and there was a storm; Kyser went alone to explore the underground mechanism and exposed the secret of the three demons; and when sleeping at night, he saw a walking light in the dark, which was actually a dog's tail. All of these were mixed with a lot of jokes amidst the tension and excitement.</p>
<p>However, the playwrights didn't seem to feel satisfied with this achievement, so they added a few songs to give the ladies who love songs a chance to appreciate them. Thus, "The Three Mesquiteers" became a three-flavored soup made with "horror, humor, and singing" as ingredients.</p>

<h3>Tang Ruoqing Recovers from Illness and Performs New Mei Luo Xiang; Duanmu Lanxin Guest Stars</h3>
<p>Of the five famous plays scheduled to be performed for the China Travel Service's eighth-anniversary celebration, "Sunrise," "Li Xiangjun," and "Hua Mulan" have already been performed. On the evening of "Hua Mulan's" performance, Tang Ruoqing suddenly fainted in the dressing room due to physical exhaustion. At that time, it not only caused a commotion among the backstage personnel, but also the audience expressed concern. However, the performance dates for the five famous plays had already been decided, so although Tang Ruoqing has recovered her health in these three days, in order to avoid disappointing the audience who have already reserved seats, it was decided to perform "New Mei Luo Xiang" as scheduled starting tomorrow night. "Hua Mulan" will be performed after "Thunderstorm" has finished. It is said that in "New Mei Luo Xiang," in addition to Tang Ruoqing playing the villainous sophisticated young woman Xiao Chunlan, and Tang Huaiqiu still playing the veteran Bai Senqing, the newcomer to the stage, Duanmu Lanxin, will be cast in the role of Mei Luo Xiang. Duanmu Lanxin has an amazing acting talent. It is heard that the China Travel Service first invited her to guest star, meet the audience, and then hire her as a full-time actor.</p>
