<p>社評</p>
<h3>如何感應？</h3>
<p>『四年來，數百萬將士已盡其最大力量，報効國家；但本人今日仍代表全國將士，購買法幣公債一萬圓，美金公債一千圓，英余公債五百鎊；出力之餘，再盡全力貢獻國家』，這是戰時公債勸募委員會茶話席上，蔣委員長所宣示的。『納金緩役辦法，有違兵役平等原則，應予廢止』，這是第二屆國民參政會第一次大會第五次會議所決議的。此二事，各不相牽，但其精神出發於同一基礎，而爲每一中國人民所必予以强烈的感應。在上海，雖日處境特殊，却絕對沒有限制了感應可能的最高度開展。</p>
<p>有許多老生常談，有許多平凡道理，每每被聽得的懂得的所忽略。若謂無論在一夫一婦的家庭，或三五人的集團，或千百人所依恃的事業，乃至於一個龐大的現代國家，必須其間的搆成分子能夠各竭其力，分担艱苦，然後可謀事功。如此云云，眞是人人聽得的常談，人人懂得的道挫；而考察實際，却並不因其牛凡而人人這樣幹，亦不因其既成常談而再不需要提撕。或者見近忘遠，或者知小不知大，其實遠近大小祗是一理。才幹的男子配了偸惰的妻室，勤儉的女子嫁了墮落的丈夫，便愁眉苦眼，怨天允人，喧呶責難，無有髯日；這是社會上習見的家庭，共認爲家庭的不幸。但在男女未能盡其爲國民的義務時，誰知愁苦，誰來怨允，誰曾加以責難，誰則深深的感覺得這是國家的不幸。却不能便認爲他們忘了國家。即如眼前的中國，人人深信抗建必然成功，人人想像抗建成功以後的愉快，亦人人盼切愉快的及早降臨；關懷國家的民心之齊一而熱烈，可謂無以復加矣；然而用了各竭其力，分担艱苦的尺度來考驗，盡了抗建偉業中的國民義務者，百之幾？未嘗効力報國的人民又百之幾。此類坐待其成乃至坐享其成的熊度，不但延長了到達成功的距離，且對於効力報國者，允對於數百萬將士，是絕頂的不公道。道理太平凡了，應不待誰多說，他們的良知必能自動的責備。</p>
<p>國家在戰時，耍求國民有錢出錢，有力出力，是最寬厚的耍求；試看歐戰中的英希德義諸國，乃至亟亟充實戰備的國家，那一國人民不是出了錢還要出力，出了力還要出錢？一般中國人民已經出錢出力的固然不在少數，但規避義務而自始迄今一無所出的亦復甚多；這些情形，在內地比較好，在上海則難言之矣。惟其如此，蔣委員長代表了全國將士宣示出了力還願出錢，參政會決議應出力的不許希圖出錢而便不出力，上海人對此，憑良知不能無慚恧，不能無感應吧！兵役政令未能在上海實施，惟有期待好男兒自動往內地投効。退一步說，參政會雖決議廢止納金緩役辦法，然上海的兵役適齡國民，倘因事實上不能往內地服役而自動納金，自是好男兒的義務，亦是天公地道的補救；而其光明慷慨，殊復値得稱許。至於認購公債，乃國民應盡的義務，但性質上並非强制攤派；認購與吾，是對於其人的國家觀念與義務觀念的測騐。而這一次公債同時發行法幣美金英鎊三種債票，允可視爲特別予上海人以方便之門。法幣公債一圓五圓有債票，十萬八萬，可以儘買；人人量力盡義務、不但鉅富應多多認購而已。若外幣公債，購以外幣計算，將來付息還本，無不以外幣爲單位；而所定流通的範圍復異常廣泛，簡直可以說：外幣鈔票與存單以及匯票，容或將來要受凍結的拘束而無法動彈，而持有了外幣公債票則反而活路甚多。總之，盡國民義務，爲國家效力，可以急起直追而未受時間限制，可以隨地奮發而來受空間限制；怎樣作最高度的感應。惟視其人的宏願！</p>

<h3>歐戰痛史（七）　英法聯軍　戰爭初期的失着</h3>
<p>我在前綫各處，曾大仙不少令人嘆服的軍隊，尤以摩托化師團爲最足稱道。然而有幾位頭腦較清的法軍司令的報道，却未免使人喪氣。一天晚上，北菲某師長向我直說，他希望談判和平。</p>
<p>他說道，「德軍人數遠過聯军，配備的精良，尤爲法國所望塵莫及。雙方實力，相去懸殊，何啻　壤。我部下雖勇敢善戰，視他人決不遜色，然而假使他們没有平射砲，赤手空拳，又何能阻止敵人的裝甲師團昵？」</p>
<p>就是素喜冒險勇名卓著的吉勞特將軍也相信，在一九四一年前，我們決不能採取攻勢。他對我說，「事情糟不可言，我們缺點，在太多了。第一是飛機。我身爲一軍司令，你試猜我所指揮的飛機有多少？老實說，只有八架！一架也不能再多了！當然尚有精銳的英國空軍，足以助我一臂，但是我若要它們作一次偵察飛行，先得請求喬洽将軍，轉請甘茂林將軍，再由甘茂林将軍請求英空軍司令巴拉特轉達副司令白郎脫，最後纔由他下令出動。這樣的周折，早已失去時機，試問尚有何用」。</p>
<p>我問，「假使德軍先發制人便怎樣？假使他們侵犯比利時便怎樣？」</p>
<p>他回答道，「果眞如此，我們祇得在本年內和他們周旋，那就大感棘手。」</p>
<p>德軍給我們八個月休養準備的時間，試問我們的工廠果會怎樣利用這八個月呢？眞是糟透了！這裏邊有幾個理由，當在下面一一說明。</p>
<p>第一，軍需處指導工業動員太笨拙了。製造飛機大砲所不可少的熟練工人，却被分派往各地兵營，終日祇做一些雜差。若要查明他們的去處，招回來重行工作，至少也要費上好幾個月工夫。因此平時有工人三萬餘名的蘭瑙工廠，在職車和貨車製造中本該佔着重要地位，到戰事爆發時，廠中工人却驟减至六七千名，這眞是出人意外的事！</p>
<p>第二，工程師和財政家莫不拘守一九一四年的成例，以爲戰事将延續至四五年之久，一切計劃都以此假想爲依歸。結果工廠雖有新建，但非到一九四一年甚至一九四二年不能出貨，他們不想儘量利用法國現成的工廠，也不向美國訂購戰車和飛機引擎，祇訂購最新式的機器。荚法所有的金銀，也因爲預備長期戰爭而什襲珍藏，把牠分成四五部份，每一部份規定作一年的用途。美國大工廠，本可及時供應聯軍所急需的配備，但始終未接到英法的定單。據說法國所造的引擎，價目較廉。」豈知其代價，却是戰敗的大悲據。</p>
<p>第三，一切計劃，都以是期戰爭爲根據。參謀部會爲進攻穗國齊格飛防綫而作長時間的準備。他們計算需要多少重砲方能實行進攻，其精密的程度確足使人嘆服。可是法國定製這些重砲的時候，正是迫切需要平射砲，高射砲，和輕重機關槍的時候。薩爾前綫的德軍巡邏隊都携着輕撥開槍，因此法軍巡邏隊也向長官要求頒發。可是連一枝也沒有。德軍傘兵開始降落時，法國軍官，都接到隨身佩带手槍的命令。可是法國全國所有手槍已被搜羅一空。即就我自己說說，也會不憚跋涉，往巴黎搜尋，竟會賣不到一枝。後來在六月初向義大利定購，己經爲時太晚了</p>
<p>第四，士氣的頹喪和政治的紛爭，更足以阻礙工廠的製造量。自德蘇携手之日起，共產黨工人，雖未公開反抗，亦已無心工作。加之工廠利潤，幾於全被取締，又足使小本經營者寒心。一九一四年中，小工塲和汽車廠都忙着製造砲彈，但在這次戰爭中，却從未有過。法國的工作速度，在若干月中依然與和平時代無異。</p>
<p>一九三九年十月中，萊諸正擔任着財政部長一職，突於某日晚餐畢後，決定巡邏巴黎幾家兵工廠，但見各家都是大門聚閉，不開夜工，使他駭異非常。第二天便去警告達拉第道，「假使照此下去，我們就要戰敗了，你可知道嗎？」</p>
<p>達拉第聽了一笑置之，就是我們在當時也以爲不足憑信。豈知他的話竟是千眞萬確。</p>
<p>後來由一位幹練工程師，陶德利出長軍備部，於是頓易舊觀，可是已太遲了，我是非常敬重他。他短少精悍，與人談話時，往往半閉左眼，狡猾地向對方上下打量。歷任各職，無不成績卓著。人家問他成功的秘訣，他總是說，「我有一個秘訣，就是埋頭苦幹。」</p>
<p>軍備部設在萬歲旅館，陶德利黎明即到，忙着在紅色紙上簽字，向他所屬各部主任發下緊急命令。及至屬下到部辦公時，他們桌上早已一一安放着部長手諭，限定當天答覆。陶德利這種「紅色公文」簡單率直，有時還帶些　猂之氣，曾經傳达衆口。這　且　述数條如下：</p>
<p>致各主任：「部員遲到早退，決實行考察」。</p>
<p>致某甲：我知道天氣很好，我也知道天氣很熱，但我更知道我們正值戰時，我不願見某司令在窗邊吸雪茄烟，享受，新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>致某乙：無論何時，如有人工，就應促用他們滑理一切，維持秩序，拾取廢鐵，清理陰溝，打掃路面。不要有一個人閒空無事事。管理指導是主任的職責。</p>
<p>致某廠主：法國全國機器，必須一天工作二十四小時。此事雖然困難，但非此不可。其餘枝節問題，我不過問。我需要一切，而且立刻需要。目的是「　速求取勝利。」方法是「勉爲其所不能。」</p>
<p>但當我和他單獨談話時，我發見這個平常充滿精力，富於自信的人，也有些倜擾不安，且抱悲觀。</p>
<p>我問他，「你何時　能使軍隊獲得所需的一切呢？」</p>
<p>他道，「一切嗎一九四二年前總不可能。我們已着手得太遲了。」</p>
<p>他是一個勇往直前始終不懈的人，伹他不能創造奇蹟。德國早巳在數年前猛萧先鞭，自然要望塵莫及了。</p>
<p>一月間我被派赴英，考察英國軍備，蒙他們引我參觀北海艦隊，航空軍校，陸軍訓練營，和飛機大砲的製造廠，海軍部的措施似乎無暇可擊。空軍數量雖少，也值得令人稱讚。至於陸軍方面，訓練中的兵額究有多少，就是法國軍事代表團也不知底細。</p>
<p>二月中我回阿拉斯。當時中立各國的人民已不再相信我們會勝了。即就義大利而論，墨索里尼雖傾向德國，然在開戰之初，尚能毫無偏袒，可是一到二月，就斷定英法已虚費了整個冬季，雙方實力懸殊，有增無减，因而態度頓變，羲大利無綫電台女子播音員，操法語播音，初則柔聲下氣，繼忽冷言冷語，最後竟至嘲罵了。我朋友中有遇見義大利人的，都預料到前途的險惡。當時墨索里尼已下決心，祇在等待有利的時機。</p>
<p>總而言之，在一九三九年九月至一九四〇年五月，許多英法人士確會煞費苦心，勤勞工作，不過大部份的精力都是枉費了。　（完）</p>

<h3>美更易駐軍長官　不放棄目海權益　美軍歸國謠傳不攻自破　亞洲艦隊下月卽可駛滬</h3>
<p>昨日美海軍部決以好華德上校遷調上海美第四聯隊司令、原仟貝克上校調回海軍部之消息、傳抵此間後、各界人士極表興　、僉認此舉與高　之調仟駐華大使有異曲同工之妙、外交之調動與軍事人員之遷任、象徵美國在遠東方面確具應變之決心、而在上海方面、則所有傳統統合法權益、殆不至放棄絲毫、昨日新聲社記者特以此事詢諸本埠美海軍關係方面、承吿各情如次、</p>
<p>美國加強　上海駐軍</p>
<p>連日本市美駐軍行將撤退之謠言、一則因投機者欲藉此操縱市塲、二則因侵略者之故作危詞、聳人聽聞、美海軍當局對於此種謠言、非無所聞、但所以不加吾認者、市鑒於事實之表現、勝於言詞之宣傳也、苟本埠美駐軍將因「侵略者之壓迫」而撤退、則司令長官何調之有、今當局竟在此重要時期、調遷此重要地點之重要官員、可知當局已決心維持上海之駐軍、則所有美軍將歸國之言論、可不攻自破矣、抑又有　者、英美兩國在上海保有最多之權益、今英國軍隊業已撤退、維護英美權益之重任、遂全由此美國唯一之第四聯隊擔當之、設美軍繼英軍而撤退、即表示英美願完全放棄其在滬之優勢地位、但英美果願如　乎、</p>
<p>租界局勢　並不嚴重</p>
<p>但此等非遠東形勢不至惡化之謂、蓋日本　決心南進、而英美又不廿屈服、兩者情同水火、積不相容、因此直接　突之可能性極大、無可否認、唯戰爭對於上海之影響、恐不至如想象之嚴重、因戰爭之中心在南洋而不在上海、而日本未必將攫取上海公共租界、因租界之中立、就目前情形觀之、對日實有利益、日本得以此爲奪取外滙之最後手段、即上海英美僑民、亦無被集中看守之危險、惟目前兩國僑民、正在陸續撤退中、但撒退者、僅限一般婦孺及非必要留滬之男子、况此舉並不代表戰爭之危機、而祗表示當局之警戒措置及强硬姿態、對侵略者之答覆而已、在此種暹輯下、美國駐軍得繼續留滬、至母須留滬時止、</p>
<p>美艦即將　自菲來滬</p>
<p>美國此項堅强之姿態、實有偉大之力量以爲後盾此偉大力量、在必要之情形下、將予打擊者以打擊、此非他、即現駐菲列濱之美國亞洲艦隊、外傳今年亞洲艦隊將中止來華、但此說絕不可靠、美亞洲艦隊例於冬季南進、駐泊菲島、而於春末夏初、移駐華北海面、照例於四月以前、駛入中國海、而於五月之末、駐泊靑島及烟台、如推測不至錯誤、則今年四月時、赫德上將時率領强大之艦隊過滬、目前該艦隊之實力、業已增强不少、除巡洋艦增加星那提一艘外、其他驅逐艦潛艇等各增加十餘隻、即飛機數目、亦巳大事增加、</p>
<p>美不欲戰　但不懼戰</p>
<p>深信美日戰時、此亞洲艦隊將發揮全力與敵周旋、而現駐夏威夷之軍艦將以最高速度、直駛馬尼，刺新嘉披。及荷印一帶、關於使用新嘉坡軍港一事、英美已有諒解、無庸諱言、由日來之局勢發展觀之、美日戰爭、殆不可免、但美國並不希望戰爭然亦不懼對日作戰、美國在速東之傳統政策、即爲維護中國領土完整、門戶開故、機會均等、設日本能在此條件下與美國調整邦交、大有成功可能、吾則騙詐恫嚇、均屬徒然、惟美不願與日作戰、但至必要時、美國將以準備就緒之實力、與日本一決雌雄，</p>
<p>日本顯然　仍在恫嚇就目下跡象而言、希特勒雖望日本對美作戰、但事實上日本亦何嘗願與　國「攤牌」、日本經然仍在悔嚇、僅恫嚇之程度、較前爲嚴重耳、但美國直將屈服於日本恫嚇之下乎，事責勝於雄辯、短期間內之美國措施當可爲一有力之反設、上海之人民、中國之人民及全世界之人民共鑒之、本埠美第四聯隊司令貝克上校之調回海軍部、實際上幷非一可驚人之事、但此事實背面之事實、不無注意之必耍、海軍部與太平洋戰事之關係、極爲重要、而以一熟悉滬局之駐軍司令長官調回海軍部、則該部機構之加强、自意中事、則海軍當局應變之決心可以明白見之、</p>
<p>援華制日　責無旁貸</p>
<p>世界歷史不久將有空前偉大之轉變、美國自爲一重要角色、因美國業已蒙受東西兩方之威脅、而此種威脅之解除、美國須負全責、在歐洲、援英制德義、在亞洲、援華制日本、未來之太平洋戰爭、非僅爲侷居太平洋一隅之戰爭、而爲全世界廣大之戰爭、美國深知其友邦爲中英、其敵手爲軸心、則今後之政策、除以全力為戰爭中之一員外、對於援助中英、削弱軸心一點、亦將全神注意、因中英美三國、在今日之戰爭中、已結成一堅强之堡壘、而此堡壘亦即新世界新文化之唯一基礎也、</p>

<h3>中央造幣廠銅塊　昨遭日方搬走　裝三十卡車返十餘次　價値約為四千餘萬之鉅</h3>
<p>法租界霞飛路（姚主敎路以西）一八七七號之西式　房、係國民政府上海迭幣廠於八一三滬戰發生後租賃作爲臨時辦公處者、所有廠中大宗銅換及銅塊、均移存該屋中保管、造至去年七八月間、又遷移他處辦公、祇留兩三人看守各物、不意昨日下午、日方派有大批人員、乘坐汽車、至法捕房請求派探、會同前往該號屋內搜査、六時十分、乃派探捕會同日方人員及日方帶往之運貨汽車四輛、前往該處、敲門入內、在各　嚴密搜査後、始將所有銅換及銅塊搬上卡車　去、的裝三十卡車、往返的十餘次、始搬運完畢、據云、所有搬走銅塊、價値的四千餘萬元、</p>
<h3>必需品存底充足　滬人無須杞憂　大批物品正在運滬途中　阿勒斯著文謂供應不乏</h3>
<p>著名經　評論家阿勒斯、昨日在英文大　　　發表一文、討論上海必需品來源間題、認爲各種必需品存底充足、上海人士無　杞憂、原文略稱、我人對於最近期內日常必需品之進口問題、殊無感覺惶恐之必要、本市今後能吾一如往昔、繼續自海外運得此類物品、雖尙不可知、然我人應知上海目下儲藏之中要進口品爲　頗多、且有大批物品、正在運滬途中、因之、在最　數月內、此間決不致發生物品　缺之危險、亦無因而擔憂之必要、作者相信在轉入下半年以、上海之供給問題、亦決不臻於　端嚴重之境也、</p>
<p>米煤儲量　足敷應用</p>
<p>上海所藏之麥及麵粉、爲數較少、但最主要之米、其存底固極充足，能供給至六月七月亦綽綽有餘、以言上海之燃料問題、上海目下所儲藏之煤、爲數頗多、足供上海幾個月之用、加之夏季不久即將來臨、水汀所用之煤、及其他家用煤斤、其數目皆將大見减少、是以短時期內、形勢即可改好、另一使人樂觀之現象、爲上海各大工廠、　所儲藏之煤斤、爲數皆相當衆多、</p>
<p>花紗存底　較前為多</p>
<p>棉花爲本市工業中最重要之原料、而本市目下之棉花存底、爲數仍極衆多、上海大小各紗廠現在所儲藏之棉花、咸較承平時期爲多、再者、尙有大宗棉花、正自印度巴西等地運米、以言棉紗、上海現有棉紗約三十二萬五千包、此種數目、且在增加中、因之、紡織界對將來局勢、毫不恐慌、</p>
<p>船隻問題　較為重要</p>
<p>中日戰爭之最初　年中、外界物品源源來滬、凡上海所需要之物品、外國或能盡量供給、而船隻亦極衆多、運費亦頗爲低廉、當時之問題、厥爲如何獲得外滙、目下之情形、適與之相反、由於法幣之堅挺、欲得外滙並非難事、成問題者反爲船隻、船隻數目若衆多、則上海必需品更不成問題、例如上海過去數月中、曾向凛大利亞定有大宗澳麥、因船隻缺乏、至今仍未能運來上海、吾則、上海之麵粉問題、亦可略見鬆弛、</p>
<p>限制用電　合乎邏輯</p>
<p>上海之必需品、最近期內雖不致發生問題、然未雨綢繆、終善於臨渴而掘井、我人若能先期從事預防，則將來所受之影響、亦可减少、上海主要必需品中、以煤斤來源較或問題、而上海電力公司又為最大之用煤者、故其首先實行限制辦法、實為最合邏輯之事、</p>
<p>麵粉平售　今日開始</p>
<p>福新麵粉舉行平售，將於今日起開始恢復、該廠現有麵紛計二十五萬袋、每袋售價爲二十五元三、該三角係專供販賣者之佣金、該廠恢復過去日售五十八百七十三袋原數、每星期三與星期日外、逐日出售、以售完二十五萬袋爲止、按福新題粉廠一度以原料缺乏與工人糾粉、停止此項工作、</p>
<h3>總理逝世紀念　勵行獻金</h3>
<p>後日（十二）爲總理逝世第十六週年紀念日、各界爲追念總理崇高人格及偉大功業起見、屆時將一致沉痛紀念，並下半旗停止娛樂要會，以誌哀思、各機關·公團·學校·均循例休假、滬市以環境特殊、植樹檥式、不克舉行、惟全市市民一致勵行節的獻金、以供抗建之需，藉盡戰時國民責任、兩租界當局以値此時局不靖、深恐不良份子乘機滋事、是日決實施聯合戒備一天、以資防範、</p>
<h3>美技師為中國　發明新型武器　製造材料中國自能供給　計畫書由美大使呈政府</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國技師某君、會僑居上海的十載、現居芝加哥、自中日戰爭爆發起、該技師殊關心於中國戰况、乃悉心研究特別適用於中國戰事之新型武器、能在中國內地用易得之物料、自行製造、代價低廉、製造簡便、極宜在中國土地上作戰、</p>
<p>小坦克車　代價低廉</p>
<p>此種武器係改良小型坦克車、高僅兩呎、闊的六呎、畏九呎、最高速率每小時的八十哩、其所費僅及目下代價最廉坦克車之四分之一、車上零件、縱在中國內地、亦易補充、而「自由」中國輸入之許多物斜雖供他用者、亦可用以製造此車、並無困難、</p>
<p>自行制造　大量出產</p>
<p>坦克車中僅須車員二名、平臥其中、車行時、不致被空中察見、敵方平射砲亦無從加以轟擊、此車能藉自由中國蘊藏甚豐之酒精發動行駛、其製造廠祇須工人二十名、試造一月後、即能日造五輛、工廠範圍旣小、乃可時常遷移、以避轟炸、該技師巴將此計劃送交華盛頓中國大使館、轉呈中政府、</p>
<h3>美婦孺二百人　明日撤退　披亞士輸昨抵滬</h3>
<p>上海美僑撤退問題、自經美當局再度勸吿後、聞預定乘美國總統輪船公司之披亞士總統號郵船返國者、的計二百名、多爲婦孺、其餘尙在觀望時局之演變如何、再定行止、披亞士總統號郵船、九日上午九時三十分由香港抵滬、停泊十二十三號碼頭、其中有旅客若干在滬登陸、其他乘客、則禁止上岸、該郵船預定在滬停留三十七小時、於十一日下午十時三十分、經神戶橫濱等處返回美國、</p>
<h3>前晚滃洲飯店內　男女旅客被架　晨至飯店當晚即遭逮捕　另有友人來訪亦被帶走</h3>
<p>法租界辣　德路五百八十九弄（即辣斐坊）七十號滃　飯店內、於前晚九時訐、突發生、綁架事件、當時有靑年旅客及女子各一人突被綁去、昨晨九時左右、父有赴該飯店過訪者一人、亦被帶去、茲將訪悉各時、　誌於后、</p>
<p>男女同來　賃居一室</p>
<p>該飯店於數月前、有自稱岳澤明者、年約三——餘歲、操北方口音、　室該處二直三號房間、平時出入、甚為詭秘、前日（八日）上午乃有服西裝名楊春源者、（一說楊惠明）年約二十餘歲、　揚州口音、亦往該飯店闢室、當由茶役導入與二十三號房間毘隣之二十五號、午後忽偕一靑年少女到來，入晚水去、至七時許、叫菜進餐、談笑甚歡、</p>
<p>貼隣旅客　通風報信</p>
<p>隔房旅客岳澤明、適其　偕某國男子二人到寓、一御西裝、一服中裝、該服西裝者、並身佩手槍、到後即監視賬房問、岳與另一男子、則逕入電話間、　話　畢、同返二十三號房間、其時爲七時二十五分左右、不旋踵忽來黑牌汽車四輛、駛扺該飯店門前、憂然停止、</p>
<p>兩人北架　向西駛去</p>

<p>來訪友人　亦遭挾去</p>
<p>至，晨　時許、有一李姓男子　往該飯店廿五號房間訪友、又被留駐於該房間內之某國人所扣留、但該李姓之男子、是否是楊之友人、或爲其他關係、則無位探悉、直至昨日下午五時後、該李姓男子亦被架去、至此次該一人被綁原因、一時難以査明、</p>

<h3>丁仲祜演講　衛生為五敎之所同　融五社十次講經記</h3>
<p>融五講經社第十次講經，丁仲祜君講衛生爲五敎之所同，其要旨云：人生最緊要之健康延年法，的分五類：一，多吸淸潔空氣，屋內之窗，須日夜常開，宜在屋外多做深呼吸；一，多得日光，宜在屋外行日光浴；三，多運動，惟運動不可劇烈，每日能多走路最好；叫，多吃蔬果，每日宜食胡桃六隻，橘子，平果，香蕉等的十隻，兼吃菠菜，捲心菜，靑菜，山芋，洋山芋等，加入牛乳半磅，鷄蛋兩隻，及粥飯等，一切食物，均宜細細咀嚼，然後嚥下。以上四法，皆屬於科學上之健康法，設有一人，專心實行此四法，惟終日憂愁憤怒，斥責他人，則身體必不能健康，此第五種之精神健康法，所以不可不講求也。</p>
<p>夫精神健康法者，首宜一切樂觀，每日能大笑最佳。樂觀之外，又宜一切達觀；所謂達觀者，宜用佛敎之說最爲精確，謂一切有爲法，如功名富貴田地房產及家屬等，皆如搬演戲劇，雖外　上富麗　嚴，盛極一時，然不久即烟消火滅，化為烏有。所以趁富貴時，除衣食住敎育　之外，即宜以餘貲幫助社會，作種種利人之事，不可私諸一家，使子孫多財爲患，不克上進，此即所謂達觀也。能達觀，則一切皆樂觀矣，於是濟之以科學，上四種健康法，而其法始完備無缺</p>
<p>基督教生命觀</p>
<p>權由祝匡明律師講基督敎之生命觀云：基督敎之根基，建築在生命上面，茲闡述其大要：一，生命的意義，吾們　惡緒絕於敗行與惡性，經憂傷痛悔以掙脫此屬乎？血氣的舊生命，產生屬靈的新生命，新生命是永不朽壞的，因吾們所信仰的上帝，係自有——永有——而永生的，吾們旣有份於上帝的永生裏面，與上帝有　命上之交通與聯絡，自能與上帝的生命同質而同其不朽。認肉體的毀滅，不過爲生命過程中之片段而非終點，死後，繼續踏向無止境的前程</p>
<p>二，生命的根源，出於上帝的大愛，蓋上帝爲生命中，一切生命，出於上帝。人類因始祖亞當犯罪，人與上帝的交通被罪隔絕，與生命主失却交通與聯絡，遂陷於死亡。上帝因着愛，道成肉身，名叫耶穌到世上拯斯民於孽海，指示世人迷途，宣揚生命眞理，一言一行，充滿權威與神性，十足彰顯上帝的愛與能力。復爲世人流血，替世人贖罪，施展其救贖世人登峯造極之事功，更復活升天，向黑暗之預點衝出重圍：欺壞撒但死亡最後之　壘，打開生命之道路，由耶蘇的鮮血中，湧出無限量的生命</p>
<p>三，生命的獲得，基督　獲得生命之源泉爲軍生，因吾們原來的生命，出於亞當有羅性，現在耶蘇已替我們解決　的問題，被須憑着信接受這救恩的眞理，開啟心門，　上帝的生命，進到心靈裏　，產生新生命，新生命為重生而獲得的生命。總之生命蘊蓄着無窮盡的寳藏，苟能認識生命，　到生命，可以把握整個人生，過着得勝的生活。</p>

<h3>我國內國公債之現狀</h3>
<p>— 李德明</p>
<p>「八一三」前我國內債發行之回顧</p>
<p>我國內債，發源於前淸甲午年，時値中日戰爭爆發，淸廷需款孔亟，乃向人民嘉集商款，計得銀一一，〇二〇，〇〇〇兩，即行停止，但因其猶未具公債形式，尙不能認爲純粹之內債；及光緒二十四年，中日停戰，簽訂馬關條的，賠款一萬萬兩；依的在六個月內先付第一期賠款五千萬兩，第二期賠款，須在該的批準後一年內交付；其餘款則以年息五厘計算，於六年內攤還云；如能在三年內，全數付淸，則利息可以一併豁免；淸廷乃萬方張羅，初擬向外舉偵，因條件過於苛刻；旋於是年發行「昭信股票」，是爲中國發行內債之嚆矢；定額一萬萬兩，終因風氣未開，淸廷又不得人民信任，故募入數不及五百萬兩。宣統末年，革命爆發，淸廷府庫空虛，乃又發行五厘愛國公債三千萬元，以應急電，但認購者更屬寥寥；雖後强制河北山西河南等省募集，然結果所得，合以各王公大員之認購部份，總共亦不過一百六十四萬六千七百九十元而已，鼎革以還，天災時起，內戰頻仍，國家財政，匱乏異常，政府乃以發行公債，爲唯一救急挹注之方矣，茲可分三期述之：</p>
<p>（一）民元至民十時期：在此時期中，前北京政府財政部所發行之內債，計有左列八種（千元）：</p>
<p>上述各種內債，其中除民三內國公債，民四內國公債，及民七短期公　有確實擔保基金外，其餘皆空無所有，其後北京政府財政部曾採國內金融家建議，實行整理內債，一方面指撥基金，以償付民三民四內國民七之短期公債；另一方面則將民國元年以及民國八年所發行之內債，各按四折，於民國十年五六兩月中，分別換發整理六厘債票五四，三九二，二二八元，以及整理七厘債票一三，六〇〇，〇〇〇元，其餘各債，則各酌定其還本期限，切實施行，是爲我國內國公債第一次之整理。</p>
<p>（二）民十至民二十一時期：我國內債，在此時期中，除第一次內債整理後尙未償淸之整理六釐，整理七釐，七年六釐三種內債外，又由前北京政府財政部以及國民政府財政部先後發行二十五種之多，今列表示之如左（千元）：</p>
<p>自十六年國民政府成立後以迄民國二十一年二月止，對於上述各種債券之本息，均能按期償還，以故交易所之證券交易，異常發達，幾爲國內之投資中心，「九一八」以後，稅收减少，債市因而下落，迨至民國二十一年「一二八」滬戰發生，政府財政，益感困難，此時謠言蠭起，謂政府即將停付債券本息，因之偵市流動，有江河日下之勢；幸各內國債券之持票人，深明大義，皆自願犧牲自身之利，與政府合作；於是而有二十一年二月二十四延期减息辦法之實現，此爲我國內偵第二次之整理。</p>
<p>（三）民二十一至「八一三」期：在此時期中，國民政府曾於二十五年二月進行中國內債第三次之整理，自二十一年二月以迄第三次整理前夕，其間由財部發行之內國債券，計有左列十叫種（千元）：</p>
<p>截至二十五年一月底止，財政部所負之內債，除第二次整理後之十七年善後短期即將期滿，長期金融公値還期甚長，海河公債另外擔保基余外，其他尙未期滿之內國債券，共有二十一種，如再益以二十一年一月至二十五年一月問先後發行之上述依券十二種（玉萍路公債二十四年四川善後公債之擔保基金係由晋地方稅收償付此處暫不計入），共有三十三種之多，共負債額十四萬六千萬元，每月應付本息甚金，達一千五百萬元之鉅，至二十五年二月一日，乃一律歸併於統一公債十四萬六千萬元內；原有債券名稱，從此不復存在。茲將發行統一公偵之辦法內容，依條例所載，舉其要點於後。</p>
<p>一，統一公債額，共為十四萬千萬元，　以舊有之各種債券憑證，各依其原定淸償期限之長短，換償如次：</p>
<p>統甲：換價二十二愛國庫券等六種，總額為一萬五千萬元。</p>
<p>統乙：換償十九年善後庫券等五種，總額爲一萬五千萬元。</p>
<p>統丙：換償十八年編遺庫券等九種，總額爲一萬五千萬元。</p>
<p>統丁：換償十九年關稅公債等八種，總額爲五萬五千萬元。</p>
<p>統戊：換償二十三年　稅庫券等五種，總額爲二萬六千萬元。</p>
<p>二，利率一律改爲六六六厘</p>
<p>三，償還期限甲種爲十二年還淸，乙種爲</p>
<p>五年還淸，丙種爲十八年還淸，丁種爲二十</p>
<p>一年還淸，戊種為二十四年還淸，均為每六個月抽籤還本一次。</p>
<p>四，統一公債還本付息基金，仍各照舊有債券原案規定，由關稅項下撥付。</p>
<p>此次財部發行統一公偵換償舊債，每年約可節省債費支出八千五百萬元，此種偉大之措施，在我國公債史上，可謂最堪紀念一頁！由此以後以至「八一三」目，我國所繼續發行之內債，由財部發行而以　稅作基金者：有二十五年三月一日之復興公債三萬四千萬元；由財部發行而以省之鹽稅作基金者：有二十五年四月一日之四川善後公債一千五百萬元；二十五年十月一日之廣東金融整理公債一萬一千萬元。</p>
<h3>看到　聽到　想到</h3>
<p>過去，時局一緊張，報上就很少看到房地產的出售。召租。召頂等廣吿。現在，時局更緊張，這類廣吿反突然多起來。這種轉變所表示的：是地產的前途，同時也是上海的前途。</p>
<p>寗使按月照來價賣給某方若干包米，而取得在浦東囤米的可能。你說他喪盡天良，他笑你不通世故。本報很早指出租界區裹的米蛀蟲，和界外的某方在裏應外合，狼狽爲好，共同操縱本市米價的。</p>
<p>澈査棧存米的聲浪一高，跟着就「洩漏」存米大都囤在浦東的消息。一部份囤在浦東是事實，但這時才把春光洩漏，用意使人相信「無法執行調査　米」的困難，而把這輿論一致要求「澈査棧米」的決議打銷。</p>
<p>「八一三」後我國新發行之內債</p>
<p>自蘆溝橋戰事發生以來，戰費支出，極爲浩大！建國資金，所需允　。我國平日稅收，本以關鹽統稅爲大宗，此際父相繼淪陷；政府乃先後發行內國公債七種，全國人民，本有錢出錢之義，皆樂於認購，踴躍輸將，此七種內國公債之內容爲：</p>
<p>（二）救國公債：二十六年九月一日發行，按票面十足發行，總額爲國幣五萬萬元，年息四厘，自民國二十七年起，每年八月底一次付給，還本自三十年起，分三十年還淸，每年抽還本一次，擔保基金由國庫稅收指撥之。</p>
<p>（二）二十六年整理廣西金融公債：此項公債之總額爲一千七百萬元，於二十六年十二月由財政部發行，每年由廣西省鹽稅項下，提撥百二十萬元，作爲擔保基金。</p>
<p>（三）二十七年國防公債債：定額爲五萬萬元，於民國二十七年五月一日按票面十足發行，年息六厘，自民國二十八年五月一日起算，每年分次付給，即十月三十一日及四月三十日各抽籤還本一次，至民國五十八年四月三——日全部還淸，所有應還本息基金，以全部所得稅爲擔保。</p>
<p>（四）二十七年　災公債第一期：定額爲國幣三千萬元，於民國二十七年七月一日按照票面九八發行，年息四厘，自民國二十八年七月一日起算，每年分兩次還本付息，至民國五十年六月三十日全部還淸，付基金以中央救災準備金爲擔保，還本基金由國庫稅收項下指撥之</p>
<p>（五）一十八年建設公債：定額爲六萬萬元，分兩期發行，計四月一日及八月一日各發行三萬萬元，利息六厘，期限爲二十五年，指定已辦新辦各項國營事業暨其地建設事業之餘利，以及鹽稅項下加徵之建設事菜專款爲還本付息之基金，如有不足，由國庫如數撥袖足額。</p>
<p>（六）二十八年軍需公債：總額六　萬元，二十八年六月一日及十月一日各發行三萬萬元，年息六厘，自發行日起，前兩年祇付利息，兩年後，每年還本付息兩次，至民國五十五年五月底及九月底分別還淸，基金以統稅及烟酒稅爲擔保。</p>
<p>（七）二千九年軍需公債：總額十二萬萬元，二十九年三月一日及九月一日各發行六萬萬元，年息為六厘，自　行日起，前兩年祇　利息，自民國三十二年起開始這本，分二——五年償淸，每　個月抽　還本一次，基金由國庫收入項下撥付之。</p>
<p>截至目　止，我國由財政部發行各種有確實擔保之內國公債，連同「八一三」以前之舊債一併　算，共有十八種，其中直接由中央之收入作擔保基金者十三種；其他由各省之收人作擔保甚金者五種。今將各債券之現負餘額，綠如下表：（千元）</p>
<p>（甲）以中央之收人作基金者：</p>
<p>（乙）以地方之收入作基金者：</p>
<p>內債價格漲落之經過</p>
<p>我國內國公偵之基金，自經二十一年實行延期减息辦法後，即一律改由關稅抵充，每月由總稅務司撥交國債基金管理委員會存儲付，此後中央財政，雖處於極端困難時期，內債本息之償還則從未愆期，因此債信日著。民國二十六年六月，統一五種公債之價格，竟達開拍以來未有之最高紀錄，頓使我國證交前途，充滿樂觀空氣；及自蘆橋事起，債市方呈搖曳之勢；及八月初，政府爲防止投機份子操縱起見，特限定統一五種公債之最低價格，計甲種爲七十六元，乙種爲七十三元五角，丙種爲七十一元五角，丁戊兩種則各爲七十元，其後滬戰開始，證券交易所奉命停辦，惟暗盤交易，其價已有江河日下之勢；但此後終因我國戰時金融鞏固，政府力維債信不渝；加以戰局好轉，國際援華之擴大，故暗盤下落至二十七年一月間的最低紀錄後，即逐漸回堅，其間雖時有起伏，但其一般趨勢，確已漸人佳境，截至目前止，統一各債之價格，不特已超　規定限價，且已與戰　之最高紀錄，相去不遠！今試再以統甲爲例，將其自二十七年一月以後市價漲落之情形，抄錄如下，至於其他四種價格之漲落情形，吾人自亦不難舉一反三矣。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>任何現代國家遇對外作戰時，其倉猝問　集戰費之法，不外通貸膨賬增加租稅與發行公債三種方法而已，根據中國國情以及各國先例，其中當以發行公債最爲適當，我國政府爲求其易於消納起見，並未爲鉅額之發行，且用勸募及自由購買之制度，以期社會資金之運用，不致受其影響，綜計作戰四年來，我國所發行七種之內倩，總額不過三十四萬四千七百萬元，即再益以二十七年金公倩中關金一萬萬單位，英金一千萬鎊，美金五千萬元，以及二十九年建設金公債中央金一千萬鎊美金五千萬元，如與日本二百六十萬萬公債互相比較，此數亦不爲多，戰與以來我國金融之所以始終能　於鞏固之境地者，此豈爲一重要　　　？</p>

<h3>馬鈴薯　（續）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>老實的說，馬鈴薯在智利和秘魯由野生變成家種，至少已有二千年上下的歷史了。然而要不是西班牙人的提携，它現在恐怕還局促在安達斯山上一條窄小的地帶，不和世人見面也未可知呢！西班牙人首先和甘薯一同帶到本國去，可是因爲伊比利半島也是亞熱帶性氣候，甘薯立刻得到發展的機會，滋生繁榮，所至如歸，也格外引起西班牙農民的愛護；而馬鈴薯呢，則屈居下僚，有點鬱鬱不得志的樣子：就是現在西班牙人的栽種馬鈴著，還是偶一爲之，有點「薦新獻先」的意味哩。後來四班牙人把馬鈴著當作「口糧」　的　送到墨西哥和美國北部以供給開拓殖民地的人，好了！馬鈴薯這纔得其所哉的也遇到了適宜的環境！允其是在現今的Virginia省；英國著名探險家Drake就是在地方發現它，而於一五八六年帶回大不列顚　去。以後緊接着有Walter　Raleigh,——就是那諂奉女王依利薩伯，用長衣鋪在泥水上，讓她步履過去的著名人物！——也從Virginia省把馬鈴薯運送到祖國去。所以在公元一六〇〇年左右，馬鈴薯已經奇物似的爲英格蘭人和愛爾蘭所飽！，所欣賞了。後來有一位名叫John　Gerarde的植物學家，替馬鈴薯鼓吹宣揚，也在倫敦附近試種。於是馬鈴薯漸漸普及到全英國了。不久，德國一部和法國東部，也有了馬鈴薯的足跡。至於意大利半島囑爲崇奉舊敎的曲班牙和羅馬　廷　使往來的關係，有敎士的携帶和奉獻，所以也從另一條道路得到了馬鈴薯的種。</p>
<p>然而在十七世紀初年，馬鈴薯還大槪只是當作喂牲　的草料，用爲人的食品，是遇到極劇烈的反對的。實在也是因爲與它相近的塊莖植物，大多數是含着最猛烈的毒質的。　如法國吧，國王路易十三願意把馬鈴著擴播到尺間，在一六一六年，就以身作則的用它供作御　，國王路易十四也是每餐必備，可是全不生什麼大效　。却是有一位名叫Parmentier的藥物學家兼農業經濟學家，用了一點小手段，纔把馬鈴著廣播開去！原來Parmentier是提倡這寳貴植物最熱心的人：一七七一年法國東部Besangon州的硏究院，因爲荒年，懸賞徵求「能够在歉歲代替食品的植物，」Parmentier舉薦馬鈴薯的論文竟獲選。一七七八年，他又公布了他的馬鈴薯的化學檢騐一書。可是直到一七八五年他纔得到國王路易十六和王家農業會的贊助，在巴黎四北一塊叫Sablons的平原上，試種他那極鍾愛的植物。Parmentier當着馬鈴薯快要成熟的時候，故意的請求國王派一隊兵士去看守那塊田地。消息一傳出去，人心全浮動了：是什麼珍貴的東西呀，値得國王用兵來保護着？於是越是禁　，越要染指：有的便趁黑夜去偷偷採掘，可是兵卒也故意的裝聳作啞，讓他們捆携而去。大家嘗試以後，不特無毒，而且非常甘美，這纔很快的把馬鈴薯普及到全民間了。</p>
<p>現在大家知道，馬鈴薯在歐美人食品中所佔的位置是多麽重要啊！單就愛爾蘭一島說吧：馬鈴薯幾乎是居民的惟一食糧。所以公元一八四六年頃，愛爾蘭因爲馬鈴薯歉收，竟有成千成萬的人作了餓莩，有一百多萬人離開了桑梓故土逃奔異域！這無怪廣播馬鈴薯的功臣英國植物學家Gerarde叫人雕刻自己肖像時，要手執馬鈴薯花一枝以表示他的功績了！</p>
<p>馬鈴薯從什麼時候傳進中國，現在還得不到確實的證據；我想總是五口通商以後由敎士或商人偶而携來的吧。不過馬鈴薯在中國，的確是土味氣候全非常相宜，將來一定有不可限量的發展，這還須我們加倍的提倡和推廣啊！</p>

<h3>苞米</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>米價日趨高漲，中下之戶，大有數米爲炊之嘆！然而人們不能一日無飮食，米旣漲價了，那祗有吃其他的食物來果腹，如麵粉和雜糧等；可是麵粉亦復貴得可以，比較便宜的，尙有苞米一種，拿來攙和吃吃，對於經濟上却可節省不少，如本報經濟新聞上「米飯吃不起改吃苞米」等文字，筆者亦很贊同的。</p>
<p>苞米一名包穀，又名玉蜀黍，又名蘆粟，上海人呼爲珍珠米，攷本草綱目蜀黍條載：「蜀黍種始自蜀，故謂之蜀黍，氣味：甘澀溫無毒，主治：溫中澀腸胃止霍亂等，今北地種之，以備缺糧，餘及牛馬穀之，最長者南人呼爲蘆穄，宜下地春月布種，秋月收之，莖高丈許，狀似蘆荻而內實，葉亦似蘆穗，大如帶，粒大如椒，紅黑色米，性堅實，黃赤色有二種，粘者可和糯釀酒作餌，不粘者作糕，煮粥，可以濟荒，可以養畜，稍可作帚，莖可織箔，編籬，供爨，最有利於民者。」又玉蜀黍條載：「玉蜀黍種出西土，其苗葉俱似蜀黍而肥矮，亦似薏苡，苗高三四尺，六七月開花，成穗如秕麥狀，苗心別出一苞，如稷魚形，苞上出白鬚垂　，久則苞拆子出，顆顆攅簇…………氣味：甘平無毒，主治：調中開胃，根葉煮汁飮，利小便淋瀝，燒灰酒服治產難有效」云云。觀此可知苞米濟荒，已有前言可證，而且對於身體上很有益處。所謂「蜀黍」「玉蜀黍者，按本草之說，大概就是「本蘆粟」「洋蓆粟」了，也有人呼爲六穀，俗諺有「吃了五穀想六穀「的話，以比喩人心的不足，而珍珠米之稱，最爲雋雅，也是名符其實，因爲報載苞米現　也像珍珠般貴起來了。在這年頭，正是米珠薪桂，難以生活！至於它的吃法，以磨粉和菜心熬粥，很爲適口，請大家不妨買來嘗嘗哩。</p>
<h3>衣服的色彩</h3>
<p>— 思</p>
<p>衣　的色彩，對於婦女是有相當密切的關係的，每一個少女也時常在說：「那一種色彩，對於我最合配」，所以我來談談各種色彩的性格</p>
<p>紅——紅色是再興奮不過的，它能表示一種生動的心理，不但穿的人覺得爽快，就是看的人也覺得興奮。每一個女子都可以穿紅色，除非你是神經衰弱的，或者對於你皮膚的顏色不能調和。</p>
<p>綠——綠色足以代表靑春和平自由，草綠史具有戶外新鮮空氣的象徵，常在辨公室裹做事的女子，穿一件草綠的衣服，可以調劑精神。即是在家裹穿着，也是非常適宜的。</p>
<p>黃——黃色最能使兒童喜悅的，因此，當一個女子穿了黃色衣服時，除了可以表現出伊的靑春之美，更能引起孩子們的好感。</p>
<p>黑——黑色可以顯出一種尊嚴的樣子，穿黑色衣服是很大方，但是瘦長黝黑的女子，是不大合宜的。</p>
<p>棕——棕色也可以表示出戶外的悠閒空氣，允其適合在二十五歲以下的女子，但是一色的棕色是很單調的，所以你得有黃色或橘色黃色彩的點綴。</p>
<h3>告孤島二房東</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>上海繁華甲全國，本係寸金地，故房租之貴，冠於他處，早有上海居大不易之歎。自前年國軍西撤，變爲孤島後，淪陷區域之同胞，稍有財力者，多相率避居租界，因是房租之高貴，較前更甚，大房東講理者多，所加有限，二房東最爲可惡，貪得無厭；未租以前，有種種條件，如有小孩者嫌煩而不租，人太多者因雜而不做，無保人者恐欠租金而不租，他如欲取小費，欲令先付等，名目煩多，不勝枚舉；旣租以後，有種種限制，雷燈規定最小之光度，不准早開與遲熄，煤爐因有惡濁之臭味，不許在外生火。小小一間亭子間或　披間，租金亦須二三十元，且時欲加租。故一般中等難民，出數十元之租金，所居之屋，吃睏撒皆在其內，一榻一桌與炊具馬桶以外，無揷足之處，困苦情形，一言難盡。予友袁　梅先生，自其故鄕平湖淪陷後，即携眷遷避來申，已飽受此種痛苦，昨與談及，頻頻歎息，而賦有七絕十二首，將身受苦况，詳述無遣，照錄如下，希望二房東閱後，激發天良，對於三房客稍加體諒也。（一）租得良田歲欠豐，收成怎及二房柬，生民塗炭流離甚，仰屋生財獨不同。（二）纔逃塵刦到仙津，海上桃源好避秦，莫道長安居不易，寸金尺土是春申。（三）租屋多因避難來，故居回首已成灰，一肩行李人三兩，啼哭還禁帶小孩。（四）人多屋少計堪乘，一度退租價又增，前客未遷來後客，看誰捷足快先登。（五）晨昏莫辨夾重重，侷促轅駒此寄蹤，除設臥床炊具外，一屛一几也難容。（六）借得竈披一小間，卅元出口價休還，繳租偶爾遲三日，逐客威聲令下頒。（七電燈僅許九支光，早熄遲開有定章，屋漏滿床誰負責，雇工修費自家償　（八）燃薪不許竈生烟，移置行廚到外邊，偶有客來留一宿，違伊定額罰三千。（九）趁燒打刦俗云云，貪比奸商惡十分，餘地不容留一寸，同胞羞與共人羣。（十頂人房屋耘人田，收穫雖豐享幾年，他日中原休戰　，有誰顧問有誰憐？（十一）業主幸多大量人，租加什一尙平均，米煤補救同爭助，住屋憑誰理屈伸。（十二）長途冒暑憇深林，天許行人借綠陰，覆載無私同貴賤，更容梄宿到微禽。</p>
<h3>育嬰一得</h3>
<p>— 馥</p>
<p>哺育嬰兒，可說是容易的事，也可說是難事。嬰兒的母親，假使自己有奶，而且願意自已來哺，那自然不成問題；但是如果自己沒有奶，或雖有而不光自己來哺，那就不是一樁容易解決的事了。因爲僱用奶媽，旣須注意伊的奶量奶質，允須注意伊的體格性情，因爲這都是與嬰兒健康有極大關係的。况卽使上述種種，均無問題，但奶媽的智識程度較淺，對於育嬰方法，更屬茫然，甚且有將嬰兒悶斃的情事，這不是很危險嗎？僱奶媽旣不是好辦法，當然祇好採用代乳粉，不過代乳粉種類龐雜，舶來品售價太貴，選擇却也很費事。據余家經騐，國貨純脂安健兒奶粉，質地優良，與母乳有同樣功效，冲飮非常備便，而且毫無沉澱，售價亦甚便宜。余家所有嬰孩，均係用安健兒奶粉喂養，個個活潑壯健，令人喜悅，家有嬰兒者，曷一試之。（却酬）</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>這幾天的菜蔬類中，要算油菜劍，又甜又酥，最爲可口，每斤八分，價格還算比較的便宜。所以我家每天的餐桌上，幾乎總可見到菜劍，無論葷的素的，不一而足。葷的做法，我們最歡喜把它和肉片同炒，加些竹筍片火腿絲在內，綠的白的紅的三色俱備，端到桌子上來時，一見就會引起食慾。此外炒牛肉片或炒蝦仁，略加菱粉，都很够味。素的做法，自以淸炒爲最普　。有時逢到老太太吃素，要講究一些，便再將竹筍片和冬菰片加進去，使伊老人家吃得十分滿意。</p>

<h3>浙滬歷程記</h3>
<p>— 保羅</p>
<p>自沿海各口被封鎖後，今日浙滬交通惟恃石浦一口，客有目永康來者，爲述沿途困苦悄形，茲撮其大耍，以爲旅行內地者之一助。</p>
<p>第一日自永康到溪口：金華至溪口，有直達車，路經永康，自永康至溪口，每人票價三十五元，惟車票械難得。</p>
<p>第二日自溪口到寗波：淸晨僱轎子，自溪口出發，每項七元，中午到江口，飯後改僱脚划船，每船十元。由海入河，須過土壩一道，用長鍊將船拉起，危險萬狀。當晚到寗波，宿安平旅館，每日房金二元，惟飯食奇貴，一客白飯須一元三角。</p>
<p>第三日探聽赴石浦路宿　寗波：第四日夜十時僱小船出發，次晨到橫溪，船中汚穢不堪，蟲蚤滿體。</p>
<p>第五日自橫溪到西周：淸晨僱黃包車自橫溪出發，每輛十元，行五小時至翔鶴潭中飯，換乘小帆船，過象山港，每人船價三元至四元，的四小時到西周過夜宿長與旅館。</p>
<p>第六日自西周至石浦：計程一百二十里，淸晨僱轎子出發，每乘三十元，過嶺九次，以下八嶺及三條嶺最爲險峻，聞常有土匪出沒。夜到石浦，宿新亞第第　旅館，每人每日三元，飯食在外，每人每餐三元。</p>
<p>第七日至第十日宿石浦候船。</p>
<p>第十日夜登高登輪出發，房艙每人五十元，大小帳每人十五元，小小帳的四五元。船上供給飯食，但粗　不堪入口。船行三十餘小時到吳淞口外停消。</p>
<p>第十三日至第十八日停船口外薰黃，以防鼠疫，每晨海關派人上船檢査，如有死亡，即須扣船至四十日後始准入口。</p>
<p>第十八日夜入口，至十時一刻停靠天文台碼頭，乃得登岸。</p>

<h3>敷衍</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>見人說人話，見鬼說鬼話：見善人花言巧語，見惡人低聲下氣……方式雖各有巧妙不同，其爲敷衍則一。</p>
<p>敷衍有大有小，但其仍爲敷衍則不變。</p>
<p>街頭巷尾遇到熟人，「今天天氣眞好，哈哈哈……」這是小敷衍，還沒有多大關係。</p>
<p>窮人饑得要死，「一家之主」踱出來，「別急，我會想法子抑低米價。」語氣相當「鄭重」。</p>
<p>回守頭，「大肚皮者」一手執「票」一手持「刀」……「當然當然！此時不囤，更待何時？哈哈哈……」</p>
<p>這却是大敷衍。非惟「大有關係」，並且幾萬條（怕不止）聲明喪之條　！</p>
<p>敷衍，「哈哈哈」，徒使「放　　者更「肆無忌憚」而已！</p>
<h3>「娘姨」</h3>
<p>— 鍾子芒</p>
<p>潘太太限送那個「娘姨」提了藍花布包走了之後，馬上收歛了那副金剛怒目的面容；，可是眉毛却又打絞在一起了。</p>
<p>潘太太深深感到對付「娘姨」是缺乏策略了。過年的賞錢這麽多，還嫌少，剛做滿一個號頭，却下「閃電」手段，說鄕下來了信，要回去種田。潘太太眞是哭笑不得，不免發了一陣肝火，怒目橫眉的駡了一頓，可是「娘姨」老是含着微微的笑容，終於走了；這使潘太太有點痛心，而且，又須開始去喊「娘姨」——這是一個很難的課題，潘太太一直覺得頭痛的</p>
<p>潘太太是善於撥算盤子的，所以一頓晚飯自己燒了，而咐囑薦頭行的章老闆第二天送個「娘姨」來。</p>
<p>到了明天，一大早，一個「娘姨」由章老闆帶來了。潘太太向那新女傭的渾身打量，只見那個瓜子臉兄上梳着烏光光的頭，後面盤了一個S，海藍色半新不舊的旗袍，裏　還穿着黑毛葛的綢褲哩；這使潘太太無名火跳起三丈，「西家比東家還漂亮，唔，還擦胭脂！哼！」本想開口回絕，章老闆已先說試試看，潘太太再一想今天的馬桶還沒有倒，並且傭人衣着漂亮，也可以增加主人的光彩，試試也罷！</p>
<p>這個時髦「娘姨」第一天很恭順，唯命是從，而允使潘太太感到滿意的是吃飯吃得少，只有兩小碗，菜呢——一口靑菜三口飯，是頗合潘太太選擇「娘姨」的標準。潘太太有這樣的一手，工資大半隻洋不打緊，就只要「娘姨」少吃一點飯，最好還有着素食的虔誠，那麼省下的米量就不少，而父不須防偷嘴了。</p>
<p>可是事實與理想是大爲相差的，新來的「娘姨」到了第二天晚上，便要請假出去。在潘太太萬分猜疑之下，好像火盆裹缺了幾隻煤球；不過潘太太耐心是好的，——可是到了第三天，樓上的在家「娘姨」偷溜溜的吿訴潘太太說：那個「娘姨」打花會贏了錢；並且還說「東家」的壞話，小菜不好，老是一碗黃豆芽或靑菜。</p>
<p>當然，旣沒有「批賬」，馬上，潘太太發下命令，開銷了幾角錢，叫這新女傭走了再說。</p>
<p>潘太太決定還是從「鄉下貨」着手，比「老上海」老實些，可以管制得住，的束得牢。</p>
<p>所以，章老闆又送上一個「道地」的並且是「昨天才到上海」的鄕下女人。</p>
<p>那是一個黃臘色的面孔說話粗聲粗氣的，破的釘補的棉襖，布襪子的後跟還有着一塊藍色的小方塊補着——總之還是個不懂「娘姨」這稱呼的解說，僅只是到都市裏來掙活的鄕下中年婦人。</p>
<p>做事確是誠懇的，潘太太便乘機把笨重的工作壓在這「娘姨一的身上；拖完了地板，又是洗兩牀被。不過，吃飯是三大碗，不折不扣，吃完了便又開始工作，沒有一句言語，完全是一副樸厚的本色。</p>
<p>潘太太揭開飯鍋便知「標準」已被「突破」——潘太太宛如看到了一個無洞，嚇了一跳；非但不生胃病，非但不吃素，還吃得這樣的多，三大碗的飯，潘太太越想越不値得。</p>
<p>潘太太驀然的叫這鄕下女人走，快快的走，免得再吃頓晚飯。</p>
<p>鄕下女人痛苦地，莫明其妙地，拖着那疲乏的步子，悵惘的走了。</p>
<p>潘太太氣憤憤的往褪色的沙發墊上一坐，她也頗爲困乏，她爲覓尋一個忠實的，做事做得多，吃飯吃得少的做「牛馬」似的「娘姨」而苦惱着……</p>

<p>愛，這眞是人世間最不可捉摸的一件東西了！有許多人說是根本沒有的，所謂父母兄弟子女之問的愛，那純粹是一種利害的結合，脫離了利害，愛就絕對不會在他們中間存在；再說男女之間，那是向來被公認爲最容易發生愛的酵素的，但要是把他們完全拆開來看，那末所能見到的，無非也祗是慾的追逐而已。這樣偏激的議論，當然有許多人是不贊成的，因爲事實告訴我們，古往今來，正不知道有多少國民，很悲壯地爲他們的國家犧牲了一切；多少父母，很慘痛地爲他們的子女犧牲了自己；多少子女，很勇敢地爲他們的父母犧牲了所有的幸福；還有數不盡的痴男怨女，甘心爲着另一個人，忍受一切的痛苦，甚至抑鬱憔悴血死，粉身碎骨而死，斷頭瀝血而亡……。這可不是僅僅利害或肉慾的追求所能促成的吧！其間顯然是有一種不可思議的偉大的力量的，那是什麽？除了愛，世界上就沒有別的東西可以產生這樣在熱的魔力了！</p>
<p>然而人類太聰明了，漸漸地，　於把這最可寳貴的愛隨意濫用起來，甚至借着他做幌子，幹出種種相愛絕對相反的勾當來；於是我們的眼睛昏花了，金錢，虛榮，肉慾，全和愛混成了一起，即使是一個最聰明的人，有時候也會感到無從分辨，正像你要在理髮室的地上，找出一根眞正屬於你自己的頭髮米一樣。</p>
<p>對於一個唱戲的人，愛格外是一個疑問。就他們本身來說，天天唱戲，悲歡離合的情節，像炒冷飯似的一次一次的在他們的靈感上流轉着，終於麻太了他們的感覺，什麼是假戲，什麼是眞事，簡直分不出來了；要希望有眞止的愛，從他們的心坎裏滋長起來，差不多已和希望從石田裹長出稻穀同樣的難能了。即使他們偶然很例外地對人家發生了眞愛，人家也不會相信他們，因爲他們在舞台上的表情太好了，一下台，無論他們做出怎樣熱烈的表示，也不會比台上更好，而人家也　當是假勁了！</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Guarantees at the National参政会 That He Will No Longer Use Military Force to Sanction the Communists; Hopes the Communists Will Immediately Accept Advice and Change Their Attitude; Seeks a Reasonable Resolution to the Kuomintang-Communist Issue in the National参政会</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to today's announcement, the Chinese Communist Party has presented political and military demands to the National参政会. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated that the Communist Party's demands are no different from those Japan presented to the Kuomintang before the Lugouqiao Incident. Chiang also stated, "If the Communist Party obeys orders and ceases attacking other troops, the government will deal with them leniently. If they continue to disobey orders, violate discipline, and hinder the war effort, the government, for the sake of national interest and to ensure final victory, has no choice but to restrain them. However, I can guarantee that in the future, military action will never again be used to sanction the Communist Party. If the Communist Party adheres to the Three Principles of the People, fulfills its promise of the 26th year (1937), abolishes the Chinese Soviet government, and abolishes the Red Army, then I will not hold them accountable for the past. If the government accepts the Communist Party's demands, can China still be considered a nation?" The Chairman stated that the Communist Party demands that the government not sanction rebel troops and requests the demarcation of special zones outside of Chongqing's jurisdiction to form separate political organizations. This is, in effect, seeking special privileges not afforded to other parties. To make such demands at this time is openly opposing the National Government and the National参政会. Accepting their political demands would be tantamount to seizing power before the enemy. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said, "I believe they did not fully understand the gravity of their demands when drafting them. The government cannot recognize a part of the National Revolutionary Army as the Communist Party's army, because China can only have one army. In the political sphere, there can only be one governing power. The democratic regime behind the Japanese lines demanded by the Communist Party can only be equated with 'Manchukuo' and the 'Nanjing regime.'" Since the 27th year (1938), the Eighteenth Group Army has acted freely, disregarding orders from superiors, with grave consequences, shaking the nation and undermining the war effort. The Communist Party's demands to cease challenges, withdraw the anti-Communist forces from Central China, and immediately cease hostile actions are all deceptive propaganda. We are now in the midst of a struggle, and the government cannot be said to have 'anti-Communist forces.'" The Chairman requested that the representatives of the参政会 earnestly implore Mao Zedong and other Communist Party representatives to fundamentally change the Chinese Communist Party's attitude and actions, and to seek a reasonable resolution to this issue within the National参政会. If the Communist Party accepts the advice of the National参政会, refrains from any actions that contradict the national policy of resistance and nation-building, and adheres to the promise of the 26th year, then the government will act in accordance with the proposals of the National参政会. (Reuter, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This morning, the full text of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech on the Communist Party issue at the National参政会, as well as the full text of the telegram from the Communist Party leaders to the National参政会, were announced here. Thus, the reasons for the current friction between the Central Government and the Communist Party, as well as the details of the negotiations between the two sides, were disclosed publicly for the first time. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech first criticized the Communist Party for attempting to establish its own armed forces and for attempting to seize national power by exploiting the current national crisis. He then stated that a major reason why the Chinese army has been slow to launch a counter-offensive against the Japanese army is the irregular activities of the Communist army. Finally, he expressed the hope that the Communist Party would fulfill its promises, obey military orders, and join the united front to resist Japanese aggression, so that victory could be achieved sooner. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's report briefly stated that the Eighteenth Group Army, since the 27th year of the Republic (1938), had disobeyed the Commander-in-Chief's orders, withdrawn to the right bank of the Yellow River, and occupied cities such as Suide (transliteration). The irregular activities of the Communist army caused disturbances in the rear and threatened the base areas of resistance and nation-building. As a result, in the past two years, the government had to fight on one hand and maintain a large army in the Northwest and South on the other to ensure the security of the rear base areas. This was one of the most painful aspects of resistance and nation-building. In other countries, when the country is invaded, the whole country works together to resist foreign aggression. In our country, we must not only deal with foreign enemies but also prepare to cope with the threats from the rear base areas. Now, we are not only strong enough to deal with foreign enemies but also strong enough to protect the safety of the rear. What is regrettable is that a large force that could have been deployed to the front must now be stationed in the rear. If the Communist army fulfills its promises and obeys the Commander-in-Chief's orders, then I believe that we can achieve a major victory in the near future, or at least restore the front lines before the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic. From now on, any army that disobeys the Commander-in-Chief's orders will be severely punished. I dare to guarantee to this council that if the Communist Party obeys orders and participates in the national resistance program, then the government will never again take military action against the Chinese Communist Party. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The National参政会 resolved today to urge the government to begin negotiations with Britain and the United States to transfer the funds deposited by the Chinese people in American banks to the Chinese government, and for the Chinese government to issue war bonds to these depositors. The National参政会 also urged the government to improve the management of the Burma Road. The council passed a total of eighty proposals, including one suggesting that civil and military officials should receive equal salaries. The closing ceremony of the council will be held tomorrow morning. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Aircraft Fly to Yichang and Bomb Japanese Troops Crossing the River, Causing Significant Losses to the Japanese</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to aviation sources, several Chinese aircraft flew to Yichang this morning for a large-scale bombing, inflicting significant damage on the Japanese troops crossing the river and their equipment. According to Japanese reports, the Japanese are now using Yichang as a base to expand outwards to disrupt the Chinese army's front lines. The Yichang airfield has more than 200 Japanese aircraft stationed there. (Havas World Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Western Guangdong Recapture Dianbai and Shuidong; Japanese Troops Retreat to Ships Due to Overwhelming Force</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Central News Agency reported today that Chinese reinforcements have arrived on the southwestern coast of Guangdong Province, where Japanese troops landed on Shangxing, and have recovered two important coastal towns, Dianbai and Shuidong. The Japanese troops fled, retreating to ships, leaving behind 200 bodies. Simultaneously, on another front, Japanese aircraft attacked Yidong, north of Yichang, where the Japanese troops are now beginning to consolidate their position. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Guangzhou - The Japanese Army Information Bureau in South China announced that the Japanese troops occupying several locations on the 400-kilometer-long narrow strip of land on the southern coast of Guangdong Province suddenly withdrew today, March 3rd. The reason given was that the purpose of disrupting the Chongqing transportation bases in the area had been achieved. It was no longer necessary to station troops near Ronggen, Dingbai, Shuidong (all transliterations), Leizhou, Beihai, and various ports, so they have all been withdrawn. According to official announcements, the withdrawing Japanese troops are now concentrated in an undisclosed location, so that they can repeat these military actions when necessary. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Eastern Anhui Recapture Guhe</h3>
<p>Lihuang - On the 1st, Japanese troops mobilized over 10,000 soldiers, along with more than 40 artillery pieces, from the Jinpu and Huainan Railways, advancing towards China in multiple directions from Chuxian County, Quanjiao, Dingyuan, Guoxian, Hefei, and Tongyanghe. When the Chinese troops in eastern Anhui found advantageous terrain for attacking the Japanese, they launched counter-attacks in segments and utilized the terrain to encircle the Japanese. Unable to withstand the attacks, the Japanese retreated westward. On the 4th, the Chinese troops recaptured Guhe and are currently pursuing the Japanese. (Electric dispatch on the 9th)</p>
<h3>Save-Our-Homeland Conference</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How to Respond?</h3>
<p>"Over the past four years, millions of soldiers have done their utmost to serve the country; however, today I still represent the soldiers of the entire nation in purchasing 10,000 yuan of legal tender bonds, 1,000 US dollar bonds, and 500 pounds sterling bonds; in addition to contributing my strength, I will also do my best to contribute to the country." This is what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek declared at the tea party of the wartime bond drive committee. "The method of paying money to postpone military service violates the principle of equality in military service and should be abolished." This was the resolution of the fifth meeting of the first session of the Second National 参政会. These two matters are unrelated, but their spirit originates from the same foundation and must elicit a strong response from every Chinese person. Although Shanghai's situation is special, it absolutely does not limit the highest degree of possible response.</p>
<p>There are many truisms and many ordinary principles that are often overlooked by those who hear and understand them. Whether in a family of a husband and wife, or a group of three or five people, or an enterprise relied upon by hundreds of thousands of people, or even a vast modern country, its constituent elements must each do their best and share the hardships in order to achieve success. Such words are indeed commonplace that everyone hears and principles that everyone understands; however, in reality, not everyone acts this way because they are commonplace, nor does their status as truisms mean they no longer need to be reminded. Perhaps they see the near and forget the far, or know the small and not the great, but in fact, near and far, small and great are all the same principle. When a talented man is matched with a lazy wife, or a diligent and thrifty woman marries a decadent husband, they frown, blame heaven and earth, and complain endlessly; this is a common family in society, recognized as a family's misfortune. But when men and women fail to fulfill their obligations as citizens, who knows the sorrow, who comes to complain, who has ever blamed them, who deeply feels that this is the country's misfortune? Yet we cannot simply think that they have forgotten the country. Just like China before our eyes, everyone deeply believes that the war effort will surely succeed, everyone imagines the joy after the success of the war effort, and everyone eagerly anticipates the early arrival of joy; the unity and enthusiasm of the people's hearts in caring for the country can be said to be unsurpassed; however, when examined using the standard of each doing their best and sharing the hardships, how many have fulfilled their national obligations in the great cause of the war effort? What percentage of people have never exerted their strength to serve the country? Such attitudes of sitting back and waiting for success, or even sitting back and enjoying the fruits of success, not only lengthen the distance to success but are also extremely unfair to those who exert their strength to serve the country, and especially to the millions of soldiers. The principle is too commonplace, and there should be no need for anyone to say more; their conscience will surely automatically condemn them.</p>
<p>During wartime, for a country to ask its citizens to contribute money if they have money and strength if they have strength is the most lenient of requests. Look at the countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in the European War, and even countries that are urgently strengthening their war preparations, which country's citizens did not contribute both money and strength? It is true that a large number of Chinese people have already contributed money and strength, but there are also many who have evaded their obligations and have contributed nothing from beginning to end; these situations are relatively better in the interior, but it is difficult to say in Shanghai. Because of this, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, representing the soldiers of the entire nation, declared that even after exerting strength, he is still willing to contribute money. The 参政会 resolved that those who should contribute strength should not be allowed to evade contributing strength by trying to contribute money instead. People in Shanghai, based on their conscience, cannot but feel ashamed and cannot but respond! Military service regulations have not been implemented in Shanghai, so we can only hope that good men will voluntarily go to the interior to serve. Taking a step back, although the 参政会 resolved to abolish the method of paying money to postpone military service, if eligible draftees in Shanghai cannot realistically serve in the interior and voluntarily pay money, this is the obligation of good men and a fair and reasonable remedy; and their open-minded generosity is truly worthy of praise. As for purchasing government bonds, it is a national obligation, but it is not a compulsory apportionment in nature; purchasing or not purchasing is a test of a person's national concept and sense of obligation. And this time, the government bonds are simultaneously issued in three currencies: legal tender, US dollars, and British pounds, which can be regarded as a special convenience offered to the people of Shanghai. Legal tender bonds have denominations of one yuan and five yuan, and they can buy ten thousand or eight thousand without limit. Everyone does their best to fulfill their obligations, and it is not only the wealthy who should purchase a lot. As for foreign currency bonds, purchases are calculated in foreign currency, and interest and principal will be paid in foreign currency in the future. And the defined scope of circulation is extremely broad; it can simply be said that foreign currency banknotes, deposit slips, and drafts may be subject to freezing restrictions in the future and may not be able to be moved, while holding foreign currency bonds offers many more avenues. In short, fulfilling national obligations and serving the country can be quickly pursued and is not restricted by time, and can be pursued anywhere and is not restricted by space. How to make the highest degree of response depends solely on one's great ambition!</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Debate Spans a Month, Lend-Lease Act Finally Passes, Roosevelt to Sign it into Law Soon, Large Quantities of Army War Materiel to be Shipped Out</h3>
<p>Washington - According to a reliable source, President Roosevelt will sign the Lend-Lease Act tomorrow. Last night, the Senate, with a vote of 60 to 31, defeated the opposition and passed the Lend-Lease Act. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Miami - U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that President Roosevelt informed him by telephone that he will sign the Lend-Lease Act on Wednesday. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - After heated debate, the Lend-Lease Act was passed by the Senate last night with an absolute majority. American assistance to Britain in terms of military supplies and food is now guaranteed. The bill was introduced two months ago and passed by the House of Representatives a month ago. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - The Lend-Lease Act, which took exactly two months from proposal to passage, has now been sent back to the House of Representatives for review. The main provisions of the bill remain unchanged, but the following restrictions have been added: (1) The detailed disposal of U.S. military supplies should be discussed with the Army Chief of Staff and the Chief of Naval Operations in advance. (2) The value of U.S. defense articles disposed of shall not exceed US$1,300,000,000, with the value of each item determined by the head of the department in charge. (3) The terms of disposal may be determined by the President, and such terms may include payment in kind of similar or other property, or any other direct or indirect benefit that the President deems appropriate. (4) The President's authority to implement this act will expire on June 30, 1943, but Congress may terminate it at any time by a majority vote if it deems it necessary. (5) Articles transferred to one country may not be transferred to another. (6) The President shall report to Congress at least every 90 days during the period of execution of this act. (7) Congress shall appropriate funds for the procurement of all new types of articles to supply foreign governments. (8) U.S. naval vessels shall not be used to escort ships in the combat zones. (9) Existing U.S. laws regarding the use and disposal of U.S. military forces shall not be changed. When the bill was introduced in both houses on January 10, it also contained a provision stipulating that British warships could be repaired and outfitted in U.S. shipyards. In addition, there was a clause stipulating that all provisions of this act could be implemented regardless of the provisions of other laws. Authorities believe that the latter provision will override the Neutrality Act and the Johnson Act, as it would allow for the lending and leasing of munitions, the exchange of defense information, and the equipping and supplying of belligerent ships in U.S. ports. The bill was originally submitted to the Senate by Senator Barkley and to the House of Representatives by Representative McCormack, a Democrat from Massachusetts. President Roosevelt told reporters that he personally did not want the power to execute this act, but it was clear that someone had to have the power to execute it. The President also stated that the new bill does not in any way overturn the Johnson Act, which prohibits loans to certain countries that have not paid interest on their war debts (from the previous European war). This new bill, entitled the "Act to Promote the Defense of the United States," stipulates that "regardless of the provisions of any other law, the President may, at any time he deems it beneficial to national defense, authorize the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, or the heads of other departments to execute the following: 1. Manufacture any weapons in arsenals to supply the defense of any country that the President deems to be of significant importance to the defense of the United States. 2. Supply such countries with any defense article by sale, transfer, exchange, lease, or other means of disposal. 3. Test, inspect, repair, equip, calibrate, or modify defense articles ordered by other governments. 4. Transmit defense information to foreign governments. 5. Export any defense article to such countries." The term "defense article" refers to any weapon, ammunition, aircraft, warship, machine, facility, tool, raw material, or other supply necessary for manufacturing, production, and repair. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - During yesterday's Senate debate on the Lend-Lease Act, the first action was to reject an amendment stipulating that new-type warships and aircraft shall not be transferred to other countries, except for aircraft that are currently under construction internally and can be replenished within six months. Some senators believe that this amendment is the last effort by the opposition to limit the President's powers under the bill. An amendment proposed by the ruling party, stipulating that agricultural products may be included in the category of defense articles that can be transferred to other countries, has been adopted by the Senate. It is generally speculated that President Roosevelt, after approving the Lend-Lease Act, will first ship out large quantities of war materiel currently not in use by the U.S. Army and Navy. If there is a shortage of adequate transport ships, the U.S. authorities will find ways to acquire them, such as legislation allowing the Maritime Commission to charter 37 Danish ships currently docked in U.S. ports. These Danish ships cannot currently be used because they cannot obtain war risk insurance from private insurance companies. It is also speculated that the new U.S. destroyers will enter service, so the old destroyers will be transferred to Britain, but this has not yet been confirmed. In short, there is no doubt that Roosevelt wants to provide an immediate shield for democracies after the Lend-Lease Act becomes law. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>U.S. is Rapidly Moving Towards Preparedness, Central Air Defense Headquarters to be Established</h3>
<p>Washington - The United States yesterday moved swiftly towards wartime measures in peacetime. The Senate passed the epoch-making Lend-Lease Act, and the Department of War established a supreme air defense command. This air defense command will establish an Air Force headquarters to oversee the organization, training, and operations of the Air Force in the continental United States during peacetime. The headquarters will be moved from Langley Field to Bolling Field, and will be commanded by Major General Emmons. The Department of War will expand the existing 48 Army flight schools and increase the number of recruits as much as possible to accommodate the strength of 48,000 aircraft. The government also plans to submit a request to Congress in the near future for an additional US$1,000,000,000 to build an additional 12,000 aircraft. The Department of War announced that the Army plans to increase its armored forces, possibly from eight to ten divisions next year. The Department of War also announced that it has adopted a rotation policy for reserve officers in order to train more reservists. The Navy and War Departments have also requested Congress to appropriate US$115,000,000 to supplement the educational expenses of children of active-duty officers. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. government announced that it will establish a central air defense command, headed by Lieutenant General Emmons. It also stated that the Navy Department will spend US$18,000,000 to establish a new air force training base in Corpus Christi, Texas, taking the 50,000-aircraft plan one step further.

<h3>U.S. Warship Carrying Munitions Arrives in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila - The U.S. cruiser "Trenton" arrived here today from Honolulu, but it is reported that the ship will return to Honolulu next week. It is understood that the ship is carrying aircraft parts and munitions, similar to the "Cincinnati" which recently arrived here. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Department Considering Adopting Six-Day Work Week to Accelerate Completion of Two-Ocean Navy</h3>
<p>Washington - According to recent statements by senior officials, the Navy Department is currently considering adopting a six-day work week system to accelerate the completion of the two-ocean navy. The official stated that the authorities have instructed the directors of various shipyards to encourage workers to speed up work. It was also mentioned that they may even abandon the five-day (40-hour) work week system. Navy officials stated that the government cannot order workers in private factories to work longer hours each day unless the workers voluntarily agree to do so. The government has announced to the workers, "They are indeed part of the Navy." President Roosevelt has announced that an emergency situation exists, requiring the accelerated construction of naval bases acquired by the country, and extending the working hours of workers in that area. He can announce the adoption of a six-day work week in the shipbuilding process in the same way. The House Naval Affairs Committee has temporarily postponed the investigation into the production of naval aircraft and is considering two bills to accelerate the completion of the Navy's shipbuilding and armament plan, and to increase the fleet's anti-aircraft defenses. The proposal to adopt a six-day system in ordinary national defense industries was proposed by Mr. Martin, an aircraft manufacturer from Baltimore, whose factory is currently rushing to build 311 cruiser bombers for the Navy. He said that the adoption of a six-day system is essential to expedite the national defense program, as it can increase production by 12 to 15 percent. He also suggested that the government should requisition workers and factories in times of emergency so that the national defense program is not affected. Chairman Vinson of the House Naval Affairs Committee stated when postponing the investigation into naval aircraft production that the Navy Department is extremely eager to accelerate production and establish a constitution for anti-aircraft defense. One bill will use US$315,000,000 to expand shipbuilding facilities and US$194,000,000 to increase the manufacture of military supplies. Another bill will use US$300,000,000 to enhance the fleet's anti-aircraft guns and equipment. Secretary of the Navy Knox stated in a letter to the committee that anti-aircraft equipment is extremely necessary because the European war has clearly revealed this need. He said that many of the details are military secrets and cannot be disclosed, but it is said that the Navy Department plans to install steel plates on warships to strengthen resistance to aircraft bombing. Former Assistant Secretary of Labor McGrady has been hired as a special labor issues advisor to Secretary Knox and has also been hired by Secretary of War Stimson to do the same work.

<h3>President Roosevelt Broadcasts Speech Celebrating U.S. Rural Program</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt broadcast a speech last night, celebrating the anniversary of the U.S. government's rural program, stating that American agriculture is now fully prepared to fulfill its due responsibility in the overall national defense. American warehouses are full, and the food and clothing stored are sufficient to meet domestic needs, and can also meet the needs of friends overseas who are fighting for survival, those who are fighting for various democratic systems, those who are fighting against dictators to rule the world. American agricultural production has not suffered any setbacks, which is gratifying. The rural front is now prepared to meet any needs of the entire defense. Regarding the general issue of the President and the future of democracy, he said that those who live in a democratic country have a collective responsibility that cannot be escaped. We may fulfill this responsibility in an unwise manner, but we cannot escape the consequences of the path we have chosen. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Confirmation of Matsuoka's Visit to Europe</h3>
<p>Berlin - According to an official announcement yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka will visit Berlin in the near future at the invitation of the German government. During his stay in Germany, Matsuoka will participate in discussions on various cooperation issues stipulated in the Tripartite Pact. After completing discussions in Germany, Matsuoka will travel to Rome. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German political circles are greatly satisfied after the official confirmation of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Berlin. It is said that this is the first visit to Europe by a Japanese cabinet member. Those concerned point out that the Tripartite Pact has a global nature and believe that the consultation between the politician responsible for Japanese foreign policy and the leaders of the German Nazi Party will make this pact more solid. (Haitong Telegraph, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima declared to a reporter from the "People's Observer" yesterday that the construction of a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is Japan's unwavering goal. He does not believe that the United States will use force to stop Japan, but if the United States does take force, it will be of no benefit. Japan hopes to obtain understanding from the United States. The United States seems to misunderstand Japan's peaceful efforts. Japan does not provoke Saxon countries, but is always prepared to take necessary action. All human beings have the right to live happily, and Britain oppresses the peoples of East Asia and makes them slaves. All nations have the right to live and be happy. Japan's goal is to achieve this happiness. Oshima firmly believes that Germany will be victorious. Germany is in a superior position politically, militarily, and economically.

<h3>Storm on the East Coast of the United States</h3>
<p>New York - States along the Atlantic coast have been swept by a major snowstorm. The snow depth in the New York City area is one foot, and traffic is blocked. The trawler "Cottage" ran aground five miles north of Ocean City. Due to the strong winds and waves, the Coast Guard's patrol boat could not rescue it. Gale warnings have been posted in various coastal areas. Washington experienced the worst February snowfall in its history, reaching a depth of 10.1 inches. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Moscow Celebrates International Women's Day</h3>
<p>Moscow - Thirty million women engaged in Soviet agriculture and industry held celebrations yesterday to celebrate International Women's Day. Communist Party Secretary Arva issued an official statement, calling on all women, in this time of "approaching war," to prepare to replace their brothers in factories and fields, and to prepare to serve as nurses, and, if necessary, to take up arms and go to war.

<h3>Soviet Union Transfers Troops to Strengthen Black Sea Defenses, Turkey Determined to Resist Aggression, Will Receive Soviet Support if it Enters the War</h3>
<p>Vichy - According to diplomatic sources, the Soviet Union is now transferring troops to the Black Sea region to strengthen its defenses there. As a result, Turkey can transfer troops from the Caucasus border to the Thracian border. It is reported that Stalin convened an emergency meeting last week with the Foreign Minister, the Defense Minister, and the commanders of the Army and Navy. The Kiev and Odessa military districts have been reinforced with four mechanized brigades, 500 aircraft, and countless anti-aircraft guns. Most of the naval personnel are transferred to the Black Sea from the Baltic Sea and the Arctic Ocean, most of them submarine personnel. However, authoritative sources believe that German-Soviet relations have not been affected by the events of this week. The Soviet Union is merely preventing the danger of war breaking out in the Tatar Strait area. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>London - There are now many indications that Hitler is using all his power to drive British forces out of the Mediterranean. Non-British diplomatic circles are extremely anxious about the fate of Greece's future, believing that if Hitler can force Greece to give up resistance, Britain's prestige will be completely swept away. However, it is also believed that Hitler may not immediately use full-scale blitzkrieg tactics, because first, the events of this week have proven that Turkey will never go to war unless enemy forces invade its territory, but it is determined to resist; second, after Turkey joins the war, it may receive open or covert assistance from the Soviet Union. Hitler's strategy of nibbling away at Yugoslavia will eventually lead the country to join the Axis. Most observers believe that the entire Balkans, with the exception of Turkey, are not only in immediate danger of falling into Hitler's hands, but the Aegean Sea will also be occupied by German forces. Some sources believe that after Germany resolves the issues of Greece and Yugoslavia, it will attack Turkey from three sides: Greece, Bulgaria, and French Syria. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Cairo - Hitler's Balkan blitzkrieg does not seem as imminent as rumored, for the following reasons: First, the German army has not yet transported enough mechanized vehicles and aircraft from the Western Front, which is not enough to break through the fortresses in the mountains of Southern Europe; second, although Germany has taken over Romania and Bulgaria without bloodshed, the military intimidation procedures in the Balkans have not been completed, and Yugoslavia will be tempted to follow in Bulgaria's footsteps. After Yugoslavia joins the Axis, Turkey's position will be weakened, and then it can concentrate on Greece. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Germany Stations Troops on Border, Coercing Greece to Abandon Resistance, Rumored to Have Issued Note Containing "Ultimatum" Requiring Severance of Relations with Britain and Cession of Bases to Germany</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - The German ambassador to Greece has presented a note to Greek Prime Minister Koryzis stating that the only way to avoid the tragedy of war in the Balkans is to end the Greco-Italian war. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Sofia - According to the impressions here yesterday, Germany's "ultimatum" to Greece will be presented within a week or several days, ordering Greece to accept German demands within 24 hours, including negotiating peace with Italy, severing relations with Britain, revising the border with Bulgaria, ceding bases such as Thessaloniki and Patras to Germany, and completely demobilizing the Greek army. Seven German divisions are currently stationed on the Greek border, and troops are also moving within Romania. In the first three days of last week, two German divisions boarded trains in Vienna and headed to Romania. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Greece Urgently Appeals to Turkey to Fulfill Obligation to Assist</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - According to reports arriving here today, Greece, due to the possibility of German troops invading from Bulgaria at any time, is now pressuring Turkey to give Greece a guarantee of assistance. At the same time, Yugoslavia has reached the point of signing an agreement with Germany, and it is expected that a non-aggression pact will be signed in Berlin on Tuesday. It is reported that Yugoslavia has mobilized a large army of nearly one million people to strengthen its defense mechanism in case of emergency. Because Yugoslavia has already half joined the Axis camp, it is reported that Greece has formally asked Turkey whether the Turkish army is prepared to attack the German flank in the Thracian region of Greece. The Greek ambassador to Ankara has requested Turkey to immediately declare whether it will abide by the 1933 Greco-Turkish mutual assistance pact, according to which Greece and Turkey should defend their common Thracian border against any aggression. Greece has also requested Turkey to reaffirm its attitude towards the 1934 Balkan Entente, but observers believe that the pact is just a piece of paper because the signatory countries of Romania and Bulgaria cannot fulfill their obligations to Greece and Turkey. Authoritative sources in Ankara indicate that if Turkey believes that the German invasion of Greece is a threat to Turkey, then Turkey may help Greece resist Germany, but whether Turkey will automatically intervene has not been answered. The Greeks seem to be eager for a "yes" or "no" answer. (International Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Greek Government Spokesman States Prefer to Die Than Surrender, Opposes Signing Armistice Agreement with Italy, Openly Reprimands Hitler in Public Letter</h3>
<p>Athens - A government spokesman declared here yesterday that Greece will not sign an armistice agreement with Italy. Prior to this declaration, local newspapers published an open letter to Hitler, explaining why Greece sought aid from Britain. The spokesman stated, "Any idea of an armistice with Italy will be opposed by Greece. Greece is not interested in an armistice with Italy and is determined to fight to the end." The open letter to Hitler was published in the "Kathimerini" daily newspaper and was personally signed by Mr. Vlachos, the most influential editor in Greece. The letter questions why Germany wants to attack Greece.</p>
<p>The letter recounts the events before the war, stating, "When Greece knew that Prime Minister Mussolini's signature was worthless, it did not appeal to Britain. It appealed to Your Excellency (Hitler). I do not know the content of Your Excellency's reply, but I learned from General Metaxas (the recently deceased Greek Prime Minister) that Germany ordered us not to mobilize and to remain calm so as not to give the Italians an excuse. We did indeed comply with Your Excellency's advice, but Italy finally attacked us. Who did we appeal to at that time? We did appeal to Your Excellency! Your Excellency was in Florence that day. We could not fight alone, so we began to seek aid from Britain. Although Britain itself was in distress at that time, it immediately sent aid to us. Since then, we have defeated Italy on our own. Britain has never had a single soldier on Albanian territory. Your Excellency once told us that Germany would take a bystander's attitude towards the Greco-Italian war, and would only intervene if British troops landed in Thessaloniki." The letter continues, "Your Excellency is now stationing troops in Romania and is preparing on the road to Sofia, or even in the process of entering Sofia. We now see German troops crossing the Danube and entering Sofia, and we cannot help but think that Your Excellency intends to invade Greece. Is Your Excellency doing this to help Italy? If so, we can save them and let them withdraw from Albania! Your Excellency will also ask us what we will do with the British troops in Greece. We never urged them to come. It was the Italians who urged them to come. How can we let them leave? What can we say to the British who died for us? We will defend this together until the storm passes. Our troops will continue to fight if necessary. Greece will show the world how to fight, as in Epirus and Greece in the past!" (United Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>British King Goes to Scotland to Inspect Navy and Air Force</h3>
<p>London - The King and Queen drove to a naval air station on the coast of Scotland on Friday to inspect the Navy and Air Force. They spent the night at the Scottish residence, guarded by Polish soldiers. It is a historical first for foreign soldiers to guard the British King. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Nazi Iron Fist Diplomacy Works in the Balkans: Germany and Yugoslavia to Sign Non-Aggression Pact, Similar in Nature to the Turkish-Bulgarian Agreement</h3>
<p>Belgrade: Germany's iron fist diplomacy has proven effective in the Balkans. The Yugoslavian people are understandably alarmed, and the Yugoslavian government finds itself in a very difficult position. Various political and diplomatic activities have taken place in the Yugoslavian capital over the past 48 hours. Prince Regent Paul has received staff officers and other important figures. The united opposition party issued a statement on Friday expressing the nation's great concern over the government's future decisions. Those currently in charge still believe that Germany will not force Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact, and even if Germany were to do so, Yugoslavia would be unwilling to comply. However, the possibility remains that Yugoslavia will declare its continued friendship with the Axis powers. Although Yugoslavian newspapers insist that Yugoslavia will continue its policy of peace and non-participation in the war, they also emphasize the good relations between Yugoslavia and Germany. At the same time, Yugoslavia's war preparedness plans are under consideration. The current situation can be summarized in two points: first, Britain's deep sympathy for the people who are preparing to resist Germany; and second, the difficult position of the Yugoslavian government in the face of German pressure. The Yugoslavian government has so far stood firm, and the character of the Yugoslavian people is well known to Germany. Therefore, Germany may seek to end the Italian-Greek war without making any military demands on Yugoslavia. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Belgrade: It is now understood that a Yugoslav-German non-aggression pact will be signed in Berlin on Tuesday. It is expected that the wording of the pact will be similar to Yugoslavia's friendship agreements with Italy and Bulgaria, and the recent Turkish-Bulgarian agreement. None of the aforementioned agreements involve any specific obligations. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Cabinet Meeting Reviews the Situation</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: The cabinet held an important meeting this morning to discuss the attitude Yugoslavia should adopt towards the current situation. The meeting had not adjourned by the afternoon. It is generally believed here that the cabinet meeting will reach a decision on the issue of Yugoslavia accepting Germany's proposal to sign a friendship treaty or joining the new European order. Therefore, it is also possible that Yugoslavia will allow Germany to transport military equipment through its territory. In short, the official announcement of Yugoslavia's attitude will be made soon. The fact that Cabinet Minister Maček plans to go to Zagreb for a weekend vacation indicates that the cabinet has already reached an agreement. Assuming that Yugoslavia and Germany sign a friendship treaty, it will be roughly the same as the 1937 Yugoslav-Italian friendship treaty. In addition, representatives from the military and the Slovene, Serbian, and Croatian communities participated in repeated consultations between the government and the leaders of various political parties. This is extremely important. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Maintaining Neutrality: Policy Unchanged</p>
<p>The Politika newspaper in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, recently published an article strongly defending Yugoslavia's policy of neutrality, stating that the policies pursued by the Balkan countries are based on unity. In recent years, this spirit has gradually materialized. Although the current situation is full of difficulties and it has not been possible to fully implement it, past experiences have left a deep mark. Even today, the peoples of the Balkans have not forgotten this. As for Yugoslavia, it once spared no sacrifice to safeguard peace and order in the Balkans. Today, it is more difficult than before to maintain peace in the Balkans, but Yugoslavia should still adhere to its policy of "peace and non-interference in the current European war." In terms of foreign relations, Yugoslavia attaches great importance to its friendly relations with Germany. A German official stated a few days ago that the diplomatic relations between Germany and Yugoslavia are exceptionally good. This statement is indeed very valuable. In addition, the "Vreme" newspaper published an editorial strongly advocating that Yugoslavia should participate in cooperation with the new European order led by the Axis powers. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Greek Forces Launch Offensive in the Tepelene District: Italian Troops Suffer Heavy Casualties, Over a Thousand Captured</h3>
<p>Athens: The Greek High Command announced this morning that yesterday was the second day of the new offensive launched by the Greek forces in the Tepelene district of the Albanian front. Over a thousand Italian soldiers were captured. The communiqué stated, "Greek forces have captured a large number of weapons and ammunition. Greek warplanes have bombed important targets on the battlefield with considerable effect." (International News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>Athens: Yesterday, the Italian forces launched several counterattacks in the central Albanian front, but they were all repulsed by the Greek forces. The enemy suffered heavy losses, with many dead and wounded, and many were captured by the Greek forces. It has been verified that the Greek forces captured 1,050 Italian officers and soldiers on Friday. According to the latest news from the front, the Greek forces intercepted an urgent telegram from the Italian front line to its base requesting the immediate dispatch of medical supplies. This shows the victory of the Greek forces on Friday. People in Athens believe that this is a sign that Greece is determined to maintain its offensive power in Albania. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>German Submarine Activity: Attacks British Ships</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German military communiqué this afternoon stated that German submarines sank a total of 18,000 tons of enemy merchant ships. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to German military experts, German torpedo boats sank two British destroyers and 28,400 tons of merchant ships in the past few days. During this period, the blows to the enemy were particularly heavy. The recent agreement between Britain and the United States to transfer warships shows the enemy's urgent need. Yesterday's German submarine report stated that five British ships with a total of 33,000 tons were sunk. In the first week of March, Britain lost a total of 116,261 tons. (Haitong, 9th)</p>

<h3>The Painful History of the European War (VII): The Blunders of the Anglo-French Allied Forces in the Early Stages of the War</h3>
<p>I have seen many admirable troops on all fronts, especially the motorized divisions, which are most commendable. However, the reports of several clear-headed French commanders were discouraging. One evening, a division commander in North Africa told me frankly that he hoped to negotiate peace.</p>
<p>He said, "The German forces far outnumber the Allied forces, and their equipment is far superior to anything France can hope to match. The disparity in strength between the two sides is vast. Although my men are brave and good fighters, no less so than others, how can they stop the enemy's armored divisions if they don't have flat trajectory guns and are empty-handed?"</p>
<p>Even General Giraud, who was known for his adventurous courage, believed that we could not launch an offensive before 1941. He told me, "Things are terribly bad, and we have too many shortcomings. The first is airplanes. As a corps commander, can you guess how many planes I command? Frankly, only eight! Not one more! Of course, there are elite British air forces that can help me, but if I want them to make a reconnaissance flight, I must first ask General Georges, who in turn asks General Gamelin, who in turn asks Air Chief Marshal Barratt, who then forwards it to Deputy Commander Blount, and finally he orders the mission to be carried out. By the time this process is complete, the opportunity has already been lost. What use is it?"</p>
<p>I asked, "What if the Germans preemptively strike? What if they invade Belgium?"</p>
<p>He replied, "If that happens, we will have to deal with them this year, which will be very difficult."</p>
<p>The Germans gave us eight months of rest and preparation. How will our factories use these eight months? It's terrible! There are several reasons for this, which will be explained one by one below.</p>
<p>First, the military supply department's guidance on industrial mobilization was too clumsy. Skilled workers, who were essential for manufacturing aircraft and artillery, were assigned to various barracks and did odd jobs all day long. It would take at least several months to find out where they were, recall them, and get them back to work. As a result, the Renault factory, which normally had more than 30,000 workers and should have played an important role in the manufacture of vehicles and trucks, suddenly saw its workforce reduced to 6,000 or 7,000 when the war broke out. This was truly unexpected!</p>
<p>Second, engineers and financiers adhered to the precedents of 1914, assuming that the war would last for four or five years, and all plans were based on this assumption. As a result, although new factories were built, they could not deliver goods until 1941 or even 1942. They did not want to make full use of France's existing factories, nor did they order tanks and aircraft engines from the United States, only the latest models of machinery. All the gold and silver in Britain and France was carefully preserved for the long-term war, dividing it into four or five parts, each part intended for one year's use. Large factories in the United States could have supplied the Allied forces with urgently needed equipment in a timely manner, but they never received orders from Britain and France. It is said that the engines made in France were cheaper." Little did they know that the price would be the great tragedy of defeat.</p>
<p>Third, all plans were based on the assumption of a protracted war. The staff department made long-term preparations for attacking the Siegfried Line in Germany. They calculated how many heavy artillery pieces were needed to carry out the attack, and the precision was truly admirable. However, when France was ordering these heavy artillery pieces, it was in urgent need of flat trajectory guns, anti-aircraft guns, and light and heavy machine guns. German patrols on the Saar front were carrying light submachine guns, so French patrols also asked their superiors to issue them. But there wasn't even one to be had. When German paratroopers began to land, French officers were ordered to carry pistols. But all the pistols in France had been rounded up. Speaking for myself, I traveled all the way to Paris to search, but I couldn't buy one. Later, I ordered one from Italy in early June, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Fourth, the decline in morale and political disputes further hindered factory production. From the day Germany and the Soviet Union joined hands, Communist workers, although they did not openly resist, had no intention of working. In addition, the fact that factory profits were almost entirely prohibited made small business owners feel disheartened. In 1914, small factories and car factories were busy manufacturing artillery shells, but this never happened in this war. The speed of work in France remained the same as in peacetime for several months.</p>
<p>In mid-October 1939, Reynaud was serving as Minister of Finance. One day, after dinner, he decided to patrol several munitions factories in Paris, but he saw that the gates of all the factories were closed, and no night work was being done, which shocked him greatly. The next day, he went to warn Daladier, "If this continues, we will be defeated, do you know that?"</p>
<p>Daladier smiled and dismissed it, and even we at the time thought it was not credible. Little did we know that his words were absolutely true.</p>
<p>Later, an able engineer, Dautry, took over as Minister of Armaments, and the situation changed dramatically, but it was too late. I have great respect for him. He was short and stocky, and when he talked to people, he often half-closed his left eye, looking at the other person slyly. He had outstanding achievements in every position he held. When people asked him the secret to his success, he always said, "I have a secret, which is to work hard."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Armaments was located in the Hotel du Louvre. Dautry arrived at dawn and busied himself signing red papers, issuing urgent orders to the heads of the departments under him. By the time his subordinates arrived at work, they had already found the minister's instructions placed on their desks, requiring them to respond that day. Dautry's "red documents" were simple and direct, and sometimes even carried a bit of sarcasm, which had been widely circulated. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>To all department heads: "The department members' late arrivals and early departures will be investigated."</p>
<p>To Mr. A: "I know the weather is nice, and I also know the weather is hot, but I know even more that we are at war. I don't want to see a certain commander sitting by the window smoking a cigar and enjoying the fresh air."</p>
<p>To Mr. B: "Whenever there are workers, they should be urged to use them to manage everything, maintain order, pick up scrap iron, clean gutters, and sweep roads. Don't let anyone be idle. It is the responsibility of the department head to manage and guide."</p>
<p>To a certain factory owner: "All the machinery in France must work 24 hours a day. Although this is difficult, it is necessary. I will not ask about other trivial matters. I need everything, and I need it immediately. The goal is to 'quickly achieve victory.' The method is to 'force what cannot be done.'"</p>
<p>But when I talked to him alone, I found that this person, who was usually full of energy and self-confidence, was also a little disturbed and pessimistic.</p>
<p>I asked him, "When will you be able to provide the army with everything it needs?"</p>
<p>He said, "Everything? It's impossible before 1942. We started too late."</p>
<p>He was a person who went forward and persevered to the end, but he could not create miracles. Germany had already taken the lead several years ago, so it was natural that we could not catch up.</p>
<p>In January, I was sent to England to inspect British armaments. They showed me the North Sea Fleet, the Air Force Academy, the Army training camp, and the factories that manufactured aircraft and artillery. The measures taken by the Admiralty seemed impeccable. Although the Air Force was small in number, it was also commendable. As for the Army, even the French military delegation did not know how many troops were being trained.</p>
<p>I returned to Alas in February. At that time, the people of the neutral countries no longer believed that we would win. Even in Italy, Mussolini, although he leaned towards Germany, was able to remain impartial at the beginning of the war. However, by February, he had determined that Britain and France had wasted the entire winter, and the disparity in strength between the two sides had increased. As a result, his attitude changed dramatically. The Italian radio station's female announcer, who broadcast in French, initially spoke in a gentle tone, then suddenly became cold, and finally even mocked us. My friends who met Italians all anticipated the danger ahead. At that time, Mussolini had made up his mind and was only waiting for a favorable opportunity.</p>
<p>In short, from September 1939 to May 1940, many British and French people did work hard, but most of their efforts were wasted. (The End)</p>
<h3>Vichy's Reply Sent to Tokyo Yesterday: Temporary Agreement Not Yet Signed, Conflicts Erupt Again on Thai-Vietnamese Border</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Reliable sources announced that the full text of Vichy's instructions regarding the Thai-Vietnamese treaty arrived in Tokyo today. However, the signing of the temporary agreement must wait until tomorrow afternoon after Foreign Minister Matsuoka's meeting with French Ambassador Henri. The agreement was originally scheduled to be signed today, but it had to be postponed due to the delay in receiving a response from the French side. The Thai side's reply was received and forwarded to Matsuoka last night. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Well-informed Japanese sources said that the Thai-French peace agreement could be temporarily signed today. It is believed that the Vichy government's response to the five basic principles of understanding reached last Sunday will arrive here today, at which time the agreement can be signed. The Thai side's reply arrived last night. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will meet with French and Thai representatives as soon as the instructions arrive. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Japanese sources have repeatedly claimed that the peace negotiations between Thai and French representatives in Tokyo are about to result in a formal agreement, but this cannot be confirmed here. The official silence, on the contrary, is sufficient to imply that the difficulties encountered in the negotiations have not yet been completely eliminated. This assumption is in stark contrast to the general public opinion expressed by Japanese newspapers in recent days. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: The High Command announced that it had notified the Japanese government that French forces had violated the armistice agreement in three locations on the Thai-Vietnamese border on Friday and Saturday. This action is sufficient to affect Japan's success in mediating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute. As a result of these three conflicts, two Thai non-commissioned officers and one policeman are missing. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>London: The Times reviews Japan's method of mediating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, saying that after France's final hesitation, the solution to the Thai-Vietnamese dispute proposed by the Japanese government has apparently been accepted by both sides, with only a few details remaining to be discussed. This solution must be judged by its overall result. Britain has always maintained close and friendly relations with Thailand. Thailand's demands on Vietnam have been going on for a long time, and now that a peaceful solution has been reached, Britain, in ordinary circumstances, would have no other reason than to be satisfied. The Thai-Vietnamese war, which was of no benefit to either side, has now been avoided, and at least this is a comfort to both sides. However, the procedures that led to this solution cannot be said to be inseparable from mediation. Japanese troops have occupied part of Vietnamese territory. In addition to the direct threat to the local area, there is also pressure from Berlin on the Vichy government. In this environment, it is almost impossible to say that the Vichy government or the Vietnamese authorities voluntarily accepted this solution. From a distance, the Indian-Thai government may not feel particularly satisfied with the gathering of Japanese warships and aircraft near the areas they are competing for. The necessary qualifications for a mediator always lie in being impartial and having no vested interests, but Japan has already admitted that it has vested interests in the Southeast Asian events. What Japan will take as a reward for its role as a mediator remains to be seen. Japanese spokesmen have repeatedly said that the interference and mediation of other countries is not welcome or tolerable to Japan. These remarks cannot dispel the doubts arising from Japan's declaration of its position in Southeast Asia. When Japanese authorities were negotiating the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, attempting to restore the borders to their state a hundred years ago, they unfortunately encouraged clumsy rumors, pointing to Britain as obstructing the solution. Newspapers that received official instructions did their utmost to slander Britain, even fabricating the claim that Chinese troops were replacing Indian troops to defend Burma, in order to incite anti-British sentiment in Tokyo. If Japan blames Britain for the suspicions caused by its policies, it must know that Japan's advocacy of leaning towards the Axis powers has certainly painted its ability to create suspicion between Britain and Australia. Britain's views have been expressed by British Prime Minister Churchill to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, and Australian Prime Minister Menzies has also made them clear in a public speech. Menzies's words were initially misunderstood, but those who heard his voice in person would not regard it as appeasement. What Menzies expects is candor, which is often faked in international relations. Words and deeds should be consistent. Wherever there are conflicts of interest, they may be discussed with each other. Menzies is certainly prepared to do so, but only if both parties do so. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Germany Boasts of Attacking Britain: Will Use New Weapons, London Suffers Another Brutal Air Raid, Bombs Rain Down, Casualties Heavy</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels declared to reporters here yesterday that previous claims by Britain that Germany would specify a date for invading Britain had all failed. This was a fabrication by the British. Hitler never specified a date, except for what he said in his speech, that the war would be decided this year. As for the super airplanes and flying fortresses that the British are talking about, which can fly 5,000 kilometers and carry 5,000 kilograms of bombs, we know what kind of airplanes the Americans can build, but we have a weapon that will make the enemy panic when it is launched. Let the British wait and see. Germany is not afraid of the extension of the front line. Germany's manpower and material resources are so numerous that they cannot be counted. There is nowhere to store the output of military supplies. Before long, a general offensive will be launched on all fronts simultaneously. Since the beginning of the war, there have not been seven consecutive days of clear weather. If there are four weeks of weather suitable for flying, Britain will suffer a disaster like that of last September. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>London: The all-clear siren sounded this morning after German planes made the most intense raid on this city in weeks. Hundreds of high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped in a crisscross pattern over London by a swarm of German planes, so it is believed that there were heavy casualties. A bomb hit an air raid shelter, killing and wounding all the people taking refuge there. A bomb fell on a nightclub, killing and wounding many people. Another bomb fell on a street, killing and wounding countless passersby. Firefighters tried their best to put out the fires, but the high-explosive bombs hindered their progress. While German bombs were raining down, London's anti-aircraft guns fired back fiercely for several hours. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<p>London: Last night's air raid on London was the most intense in several weeks. The enemy planes ignored the heavy anti-aircraft fire and kept dropping bombs. First, they dropped flares and incendiary bombs, then high-explosive bombs. The British shot down many flares with light anti-aircraft guns, and the incendiary bombs were quickly extinguished by firefighters. A bomb that fell in the West End destroyed about ten houses, but there were no reports of heavy casualties. This morning, German planes flew close to the east coast of England and Scotland and dropped several bombs. Officials announced that, apart from a few houses destroyed in East Anglia, there was no major damage and few casualties. The Air Ministry said that there was nothing to report yesterday afternoon, but an air raid alert sounded in London at night and gunshots were heard. Two German bombers were indeed destroyed yesterday afternoon, so a total of three enemy planes have been destroyed since Friday night. As for the claim that a third enemy plane was destroyed yesterday, it has not been confirmed. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Italian Armed Merchant Ship Sunk: In the Indian Ocean</h3>
<p>London: The Admiralty issued a communiqué this morning stating that an Italian merchant ship, equipped with four 4.7-inch guns, which had been attacking merchant ships at sea, has now been captured in the Indian Ocean by the New Zealand cruiser "Leander." It has been verified that the Italian ship was the "Ramb I," with a displacement of 3,667 tons and a speed of 18.5 knots per hour. It was owned by the Italian government. When it was intercepted by the "Leander," it opened fire in resistance, but caught fire after being hit and sank into the sea after 50 minutes. The crew of 11 officers and 85 sailors were rescued by the "Leander" and are now prisoners of war. The "Leander" suffered no casualties or damage. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London: A British Admiralty communiqué stated that on March 6, the Italian submarine "Anfitrite" attempted to attack a British convoy in the Aegean Sea but was immediately sunk by an aircraft escorting the convoy. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>British Forces Advance in East Africa: Only 100 Miles from the Abyssinian Capital, Patriotic Abyssinian Troops Assist in Combat, Blackshirt Fighters Suffer Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>Khartoum: The joint forces of the British Army, the Sudanese Army, and the patriotic Abyssinian troops pursued the Italian forces all the way to Danbacha, only 170 miles from the Abyssinian capital. Italian troops fleeing from Buriye and other places were attacked by Abyssinian troops led by British officers, and then pursued from the rear and flanks by the Sudanese Army. They were eventually forced to flee to Danbacha on Friday night. The enemy suffered more than 30,000 casualties, abandoned more than a hundred corpses along the way, as well as many machine guns and armored vehicles. The British suffered very few casualties. One officer was wounded. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Cairo: Today's British Army headquarters communiqué stated that there was nothing of importance to report in Libya and Eritrea. On the Abyssinian front, the patriotic forces continued to pursue the Italian garrison withdrawing from Bure. British forces in Italian Somaliland have occupied Galkayo on the main road from Mogadishu to Harar. The areas occupied by our troops on other fronts are expanding daily, and the number of enemy prisoners is also increasing greatly. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>America Changes Garrison Commander, Does Not Give Up Rights in the East China Sea, Rumors of American Troops Returning Home Spontaneously Disappear, Asian Fleet Can Sail to Shanghai Next Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US Navy Department decided to transfer Colonel Howard to Shanghai as commander of the US 4th Marine Regiment, and Colonel Baker, the original commander, was recalled to the Navy Department. After the news reached here, people from all walks of life expressed great excitement, believing that this move had the same effect as the transfer of Ambassador Gao. Diplomatic and military personnel transfers symbolize America's determination to respond to changes in the Far East, and in Shanghai, it will not give up any traditional and unified legal rights. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency specifically inquired about this matter with the US Navy in this port, and received the following information:</p>
<p>America Strengthens Shanghai Garrison</p>
<p>The rumors that the US garrison in Shanghai was about to withdraw were partly due to speculators trying to manipulate the market and partly due to invaders deliberately making dangerous claims to sensationalize the public. The US Navy authorities were not unaware of these rumors, but they did not recognize them because they believed that the facts spoke louder than words. If the US garrison in this port was to withdraw due to "the pressure of the invaders," then what would be the point of transferring the commander? Now that the authorities have decided to transfer such an important official to this important location during this important period, it can be seen that the authorities have decided to maintain the garrison in Shanghai, and all arguments about the American troops returning home can be refuted without attacking them. Furthermore, the UK and the US have the most rights and interests in Shanghai. Now that the British troops have withdrawn, the heavy responsibility of protecting British and American rights and interests falls entirely on the US 4th Marine Regiment. If the US troops were to withdraw after the British troops, it would mean that the UK and the US were willing to completely abandon their dominant position in Shanghai. But are the UK and the US really willing to do so?</p>
<p>Concession Situation Not Serious</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the situation in the Far East will not deteriorate. Because Japan is determined to advance south, and the UK and the US are not willing to yield, the two are like fire and water, and are incompatible. Therefore, the possibility of a direct conflict is very high, which cannot be denied. However, the impact of the war on Shanghai may not be as serious as imagined, because the center of the war is in Southeast Asia and not in Shanghai, and Japan may not seize the Shanghai International Settlement. Because the neutrality of the concession, from the current situation, is actually beneficial to Japan. Japan can use this as the last means to seize foreign exchange, and even the British and American expatriates in Shanghai are not in danger of being concentrated and guarded. However, the expatriates of the two countries are gradually withdrawing, but only the general women, children, and men who are not necessary to stay in Shanghai are withdrawing. Moreover, this move does not represent a crisis of war, but only expresses the authorities' precautionary measures and tough stance in response to the invaders. Under this logic, the American garrison can continue to stay in Shanghai until it is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>American Ships Will Come to Shanghai From the Philippines</p>
<p>America's firm stance has a great power as its backing. This great power, when necessary, will strike those who need to be struck. This is none other than the US Asian Fleet currently stationed in the Philippines. It is rumored that the Asian Fleet will not come to China this year, but this statement is absolutely unreliable. The US Asian Fleet usually advances south in winter and is stationed in the Philippines, and in late spring and early summer, it moves to the sea off North China. According to regulations, it sails into the Chinese sea before April, and at the end of May, it is stationed in Qingdao and Yantai. If the prediction is not wrong, then in April this year, Admiral Hurd will lead a powerful fleet to Shanghai. Currently, the strength of the fleet has been greatly increased. In addition to the addition of the cruiser Cincinnati, more than ten other destroyers and submarines have been added. Even the number of aircraft has been greatly increased.</p>
<p>America Does Not Want War, But Is Not Afraid of War</p>
<p>It is deeply believed that in the event of a war between the US and Japan, this Asian Fleet will exert its full strength to fight the enemy, and the warships currently stationed in Hawaii will sail directly to Manila, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies at the highest speed. The UK and the US have reached an understanding on the use of the Singapore naval base, which is undeniable. Judging from the development of the situation from Japan, a war between the US and Japan is almost inevitable, but the US does not hope for war, but is not afraid to fight Japan. America's traditional policy in the Far East is to maintain China's territorial integrity, open door policy, and equal opportunities. If Japan can adjust its relations with the US under these conditions, there is a great chance of success. Lies, deception, and intimidation are all in vain. However, the US does not want to go to war with Japan, but when necessary, the US will use its well-prepared strength to compete with Japan.</p>
<p>Japan Is Clearly Still Intimidating, From the Current Signs, Although Hitler Hopes That Japan Will Fight the US, in Fact, Why Is Japan Willing to "Show Its Cards" With the US? Japan Is Still Intimidating, Only the Degree of Intimidation Is More Serious Than Before. But Will the US Succumb to Japan's Intimidation? The Facts Speak Louder Than Words. America's Measures in the Short Term Can Be a Powerful Counter-Response, Which Will Be Witnessed by the People of Shanghai, the People of China, and the People of the World. The Recall of Colonel Baker, Commander of the US 4th Marine Regiment in This Port, Is Not Actually a Shocking Thing, but the Facts Behind This Fact Must Be Paid Attention To. The Relationship Between the Navy Department and the Pacific War Is Extremely Important, and Recruiting a Garrison Commander Familiar With the Shanghai Situation Back to the Navy Department Means That the Strengthening of the Department's Mechanism Is Intentional, So the Navy Authorities' Determination to Respond to Changes Can Be Clearly Seen.</p>
<p>Assisting China in Restraining Japan Is An Unshirkable Responsibility</p>
<p>The history of the world will soon have an unprecedented great transformation. America is an important role, because America has already suffered threats from both the East and the West, and America must bear full responsibility for resolving these threats. In Europe, assist the UK in restraining Germany and Italy, and in Asia, assist China in restraining Japan. The future Pacific War is not only a war confined to a corner of the Pacific, but a vast war for the entire world. America is well aware that its allies are China and the UK, and its enemies are the Axis. Therefore, in addition to being a member of the war with all its strength, it will also pay full attention to assisting China and the UK and weakening the Axis. Because China, the UK, and the US have formed a strong fortress in today's war, and this fortress is the only foundation of the new world and the new culture.</p>
<h3>Cholera Found on Japanese Ship Sumiyoshimaru</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news, one person was found to have contracted cholera on the Japanese ship Sumiyoshimaru, which recently entered Kaohsiung Port in Taiwan from Hong Kong, and died the same day. After examination, it was determined to be cholera. At the same time, another male on the ship was also found to have the same type of disease.</p>
<h3>Copper Blocks from Central Mint Were Moved Away by Japanese Yesterday, Loaded onto Thirty Trucks and Returned More Than Ten Times, Worth About 40 Million</h3>
<p>The Western-style house at 1877 Avenue Joffre (west of Rue Pere Robert), French Concession, was rented by the Shanghai Mint of the National Government as a temporary office after the August 13th Shanghai War. All the large quantities of copper coins and blocks in the factory were moved to the house for storage. Around July or August last year, the office was moved elsewhere, leaving only two or three people to guard the goods. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, the Japanese sent a large number of people in cars to the French Concession Police to request that detectives be dispatched to search the house at that number. At 6:10, detectives were dispatched to the house with the Japanese personnel and four freight trucks brought by the Japanese. After knocking on the door and entering, they thoroughly searched each room before moving all the copper coins and blocks onto the trucks and taking them away. Thirty trucks were loaded and returned more than ten times before the transportation was completed. It is said that all the copper blocks moved away were worth more than 40 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Sufficient Reserves of Necessities, Shanghai People Do Not Need to Worry, Large Quantities of Goods Are on Their Way to Shanghai, Alers Writes That Supply Is Not Lacking</h3>
<p>Famous economic commentator Alers published an article in the English-language Da Mei Evening News yesterday, discussing the issue of the source of necessities in Shanghai, believing that there are sufficient reserves of various necessities and that Shanghai people do not need to worry. The original text is roughly as follows: We do not need to feel panic about the import of daily necessities in the near future. It is not yet known whether the city will be able to continue to import such goods from overseas as in the past, but we should know that Shanghai currently has quite a lot of important imported goods in storage, and a large quantity of goods is on their way to Shanghai. Therefore, in the next few months, there will be no danger of a shortage of goods here, and there is no need to worry about it. The author believes that the supply problem in Shanghai will not reach an extremely serious situation in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Sufficient Rice and Coal Reserves</p>
<p>Shanghai has a small amount of wheat and flour, but the most important rice has extremely sufficient reserves, which can supply until June and July with ease. As for Shanghai's fuel problem, Shanghai currently has a large amount of coal in storage, which is enough for Shanghai for several months. In addition, summer is coming soon, and the amount of coal used for water heaters and other household coal will be greatly reduced, so the situation will improve in the short term. Another optimistic phenomenon is that the major factories in Shanghai have a considerable amount of coal in storage.</p>
<p>More Cotton Yarn Reserves Than Before</p>
<p>Cotton is the most important raw material in the city's industry, and the city currently has a very large amount of cotton in storage. The cotton stored in Shanghai's large and small yarn factories is more than during peacetime. Furthermore, a large amount of cotton is being shipped from India, Brazil, and other places. As for cotton yarn, Shanghai currently has about 325,000 bales of cotton yarn, and this number is increasing. Therefore, the textile industry is not at all panicked about the future situation.</p>
<p>Ship Problem More Important</p>
<p>In the first year of the Sino-Japanese War, foreign goods came to Shanghai in a steady stream. Foreign countries were able to supply as much as Shanghai needed, and there were many ships and the freight rates were very low. At that time, the problem was how to obtain foreign exchange. The current situation is the opposite. Due to the strength of the legal tender, it is not difficult to obtain foreign exchange. The problem is the ships. If there are many ships, then the necessities in Shanghai will not be a problem. For example, Shanghai has ordered a large amount of Australian wheat from Australia in the past few months, but it has not been able to be shipped to Shanghai due to the lack of ships. Otherwise, Shanghai's flour problem can also be slightly eased.</p>
<p>Restricting Electricity Use Is Logical</p>
<p>Although Shanghai's necessities will not be a problem in the near future, it is always better to prepare for a rainy day than to dig a well when you are thirsty. If we can take preventive measures in advance, the impact we will suffer in the future can also be reduced. Among Shanghai's main necessities, the source of coal is more problematic, and the Shanghai Electric Power Company is the largest user of coal, so it is most logical to first implement restrictions.</p>
<p>Flour Sold at a Low Price Will Start Today</p>
<p>Fuxin Flour will resume selling at a low price, starting today. The factory currently has 250,000 bags of flour, and the selling price is 25.3 yuan per bag. The 3 yuan is specifically for the commission of the sellers. The factory will resume the original number of 5,873 bags sold per day, except for Wednesdays and Sundays, until all 250,000 bags are sold. According to reports, Fuxin Powder Factory once suspended this work due to a lack of raw materials and worker disputes.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Death of the Premier, Practicing Donation</h3>
<p>The day after tomorrow (12th) is the 16th anniversary of the death of the Premier. People from all walks of life will solemnly commemorate the Premier's noble character and great achievements at that time, and will lower the flag to half-mast and stop entertainment activities to express their condolences. All institutions, public organizations, and schools will be closed as usual. Due to Shanghai's special environment, tree planting ceremonies cannot be held. However, the citizens of the city will unanimously practice donation of funds to meet the needs of the war effort, and to fulfill the national responsibility during the war. The authorities of the two concessions, being aware that the situation is unstable, are deeply afraid that unscrupulous elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble. It is decided to implement a joint alert for one day to prevent this.</p>
<h3>American Engineer Invents New Weapon for China, Manufacturing Materials Can Be Supplied by China, Plan Submitted to Government by American Ambassador</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News said that an American engineer, who lived in Shanghai for ten years, is now living in Chicago. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the engineer has been very concerned about the Chinese war situation. He has carefully studied a new type of weapon specially applicable to the Chinese war, which can be manufactured by China itself using readily available materials at a low cost and with simple manufacturing. It is very suitable for fighting on Chinese soil.</p>
<p>Small Tank at Low Cost</p>
<p>This weapon is an improved small tank, only two feet high, six feet wide, and nine feet long. The maximum speed is 80 miles per hour. The cost is only a quarter of the current cheapest tank. The parts for the car can be easily replenished even in the Chinese mainland, and many of the imported materials by "Free China" that are used for other purposes can also be used to manufacture this car without difficulty.</p>
<p>Self-Manufacturing and Mass Production</p>
<p>The tank only needs two crew members, lying flat inside, so that the car will not be detected by the air, and the enemy's flat-firing guns will not be able to bombard it. This car can be driven by alcohol, which is abundant in Free China. The factory only needs 20 workers, and after a month of trial manufacturing, it can produce five vehicles a day. Since the factory area is small, it can be moved frequently to avoid bombing. The engineer has sent the plan to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for submission to the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Two Hundred American Women and Children to Retreat Tomorrow, President Pierce Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the evacuation of American expatriates in Shanghai, since the American authorities have repeatedly advised them, it is reported that there are about 200 people who are scheduled to return to the country on the American President Lines' President Pierce. Most of them are women and children, and the rest are still waiting to see how the situation develops before deciding what to do. The President Pierce arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at 9:30 a.m. on the 9th and docked at Pier 1213. Some passengers disembarked in Shanghai, while other passengers were prohibited from landing. The ship is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for 37 hours and return to the United States via Kobe and Yokohama at 10:30 p.m. on the 11th.</p>
<h3>Male and Female Travelers Were Kidnapped Inside the Wengzhou Hotel Last Night, Arrested That Night Upon Arrival at Hotel in Morning, Visiting Friend Also Taken Away</h3>
<p>In the Wengzhou Hotel at No. 70, Lane 589, Route Lafayette (i.e. Lafayette Fang), French Concession, a kidnapping occurred suddenly at 9 p.m. the night before last. At that time, one young traveler and one woman were suddenly kidnapped. At about 9 a.m. yesterday morning, one person who went to the hotel to visit was also taken away. The details of what was learned are recorded below:</p>
<p>Man and Woman Arrive Together, Renting One Room</p>
<p>Several months ago, a man claiming to be Yue Zeming, about 30 years old, speaking with a northern accent, rented Room 23 in the hotel. He was very secretive about his comings and goings. The day before yesterday (8th), a man in a suit named Yang Chunyuan (some say Yang Huiming), about 20 years old, speaking with a Yangzhou accent, also went to the hotel to open a room. The tea boy led him to Room 25, which was next to Room 23. In the afternoon, he suddenly came with a young girl and went in. In the evening, they went to the water and then, at about 7 o'clock, ordered food and ate, talking and laughing happily.</p>
<p>Next Door Traveler, Informs</p>
<p>Yue Zeming, a traveler in the next room, happened to have two men from a certain country arrive at his residence, one in a suit and the other in Chinese clothes. The one in the suit was wearing a pistol. After arriving, he monitored the cashier. Yue and the other man then went to the telephone room. After finishing the call, they returned to Room 23. At that time, it was about 7:25. Suddenly, four black-plated cars came and stopped quietly in front of the hotel.</p>
<p>Two People Kidnapped and Driven West</p>
<p>More than 20 people in miscellaneous clothes from a certain country got out of the cars. Half of them guarded the surroundings, and the other half broke into the hotel and went straight to Room 25. After a thorough search, which lasted more than 20 minutes, they took Yang and his girlfriend into the car and drove away quickly to the west, disappearing without a trace. Yue Zeming also left after the incident.</p>
<p>Visiting Friend Also Kidnapped</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. yesterday morning, a man surnamed Li went to Room 25 of the hotel to visit a friend, and was also detained by the people from a certain country who were staying in the room. However, it is not known whether the man surnamed Li was Yang's friend or had other relationships. It was not until after 5 p.m. yesterday that the man surnamed Li was also kidnapped. The reason for the kidnapping of this one person is difficult to ascertain for the time being.</p>
<h3>Mantingfang Robbery Case, Three Thieves Apprehended</h3>
<p>In the Guangdong Road Mantingfang, No. 38-40 Xishanglin, a double-fronted building, the shop of a certain timber merchant, at about 5 p.m. yesterday, five bandits suddenly broke into the shop. Three of the thieves took out guns to intimidate, not allowing anyone to make a sound. A huge amount of property was robbed. Later, the shop's gatekeeper saw them, immediately drew his gun and fired two shots into the sky. The thieves heard the gunfire, knew that things were not good, and hurriedly took the stolen goods and rushed out the door to escape. Unexpectedly, at this time, the police also received an alarm and sent detectives to arrest them outside. Three thieves were arrested on the spot, and two pistols were found. They were taken to the police station for investigation. The remaining bandits escaped without a trace.</p>
<h3>Ding Zhonghu's Speech, Hygiene is Common to All Five Religions, A Record of the 10th Lecture of the Rongwu Society</h3>
<p>The 10th lecture of the Rongwu Lecture Society, Ding Zhonghu spoke on hygiene as common to all five religions. The main points are: The most important health and longevity method in life is divided into five categories: 1. Breathe more clean air. The windows of the house should be opened day and night, and it is advisable to do deep breathing outdoors; 2. Get more sunlight. It is advisable to sunbathe outdoors; 3. Exercise more, but exercise should not be strenuous, and it is best to walk more every day; 4. Eat more fruits and vegetables. It is advisable to eat six walnuts, ten oranges, apples, bananas, etc., and eat spinach, cabbage, green vegetables, sweet potatoes, and potatoes every day, add half a pound of milk, two eggs, and porridge, etc. All food should be chewed carefully before swallowing. The above four methods all belong to the scientific health method. If one person concentrates on practicing these four methods, but is worried, angry, and scolds others all day long, then the body must not be healthy. This fifth kind of mental health method is indispensable.</p>
<p>The mental health method should first be optimistic in everything, and it is best to laugh loudly every day. In addition to being optimistic, one should also be understanding in everything. The Buddhist saying is the most accurate for what is meant by understanding, saying that all conditioned dharmas, such as fame, wealth, land, property, and family members, are like performing a play. Although they are outwardly gorgeous and solemn, and at their peak for a time, they will soon disappear and turn into nothing. Therefore, when rich and noble, in addition to clothing, food, housing, and education, one should use the surplus to help society and do all kinds of things that benefit people, and not privately for one's own family, so that one's children and grandchildren will suffer from too much wealth and will not be able to make progress. This is what is meant by understanding. If one can be understanding, then everything is optimistic. Then, combined with science, the above four kinds of health methods, then the method is complete and flawless.</p>
<p>Christian View of Life</p>
<p>Quan Youzhu Kuangming, a lawyer, spoke on the Christian view of life, saying: The foundation of Christianity is built on life. Here are the main points: 1. The meaning of life. We get rid of bad habits and evil nature, and through sorrow and repentance, we break free from this old life that belongs to the flesh, and produce a new spiritual life. The new life is immortal, because the God we believe in is self-existent, eternally existent, and eternally living. Since we have a share in God's eternal life, and have spiritual communication and connection with God, we can naturally have the same substance as God's life and be immortal with it. Recognize that the destruction of the physical body is only a segment of the life process and not the end. After death, continue to step towards an endless future.</p>
<p>2. The source of life comes from God's great love, because God is the origin of all life in life, which comes from God. Because the ancestors of mankind, Adam and Eve, committed a crime, the communication between man and God was cut off by sin, and they lost communication and connection with the Lord of Life, and thus fell into death. God, out of love, became flesh and was named Jesus to save the people from the sea of sin, to show the people the lost way, and to proclaim the truth of life. Every word and deed is full of authority and divinity, fully demonstrating God's love and power. He also shed his blood for the world, atoned for the sins of the world, and carried out his feat of redeeming the world to the highest peak, and even resurrected and ascended to heaven, broke out of the encirclement from the darkness, destroyed Satan and the final fortress of death, and opened the way of life. From the fresh blood of Jesus, an unlimited amount of life poured out.</p>
<p>3. The acquisition of life. Christ's source of life is Jun Sheng, because our original life, from Adam, has a rational nature. Now Jesus has solved the problem of sin for us, and we must accept this truth of salvation through faith, open the door of our hearts, and the life of God will enter our hearts and produce a new life. The new life is the life obtained by rebirth. In short, life contains endless treasures. If we can recognize life and receive life, we can grasp the whole of life and live a victorious life.</p>

<p>Once Had a Love Affair and Cohabitated with a Cotton Mill Owner, After Moving to Shanghai, She Was Not Tolerated by the First Wife</p>
<p>Ye Qide, a cotton mill owner from Ningbo, owner of Dalong Cotton Mill at No. 8, Lane 563, Connaught Road, was working at the Central Bank of Hong Kong when he had a love affair and cohabited with Shen Meili, also known as Pu Aoshuang (currently 26 years old), a woman from Nanxiang. In July last year, he took the woman from Kunming, Ningbo, and other places to Shanghai and lived at a certain number in Caojiadu, keeping her hidden. Last winter, the woman and Ye Qide were threatened and abused by his first wife,</p>
<p>Separated in December 31st of last year, Ye reported to the Gordon Road Police, accusing Shen Meili of taking a car to take him to the Six Nations Hotel on Haig Road, where she colluded with Ye Pei, who was on the run, and a number of thugs, who took out pistols and threatened him, extorting 10,000 yuan in national currency unsuccessfully. He ordered Zhang Fangdao, a tea boy at the hotel from Haimen, and others to move cotton fabrics and shirts worth 5,000 yuan from the Dalong Factory. The police sent detectives to arrest Zhang Fangdao and sent him to the First Special District Court for questioning. Shen was also detained in the woman's prison while listening in the courtroom, and was once on trial with Zhang. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi opened the third criminal court for trial. The police first listened to Jiang Baolian's statement of the case and filed a public prosecution on charges of intimidation and fraud, stating that the fugitive Ye Pei was unable to be arrested during the change of term. Ye Qide said that he had divorced his wife because of Shen, pointing out that she was a dancer in Hong Kong and then cohabited with her, and stated the details. The defendant Zhang Fangdao pleaded that he had nothing to do with moving goods from the Dalong Factory, and denied participating in helping Shen to intimidate and extort money, and asked for forgiveness. When questioned, Shen Meili burst into tears, crying and said that she was a widow who was seduced and lost her virginity by Ye Qide, and followed him to Hong Kong, Kunming, Ningbo, and other places. Last autumn, she came to Shanghai and lived in his home in Caojiadu, where she was beaten, resulting in a miscarriage of a month-old pregnancy. She was cheated out of 12,000 yuan in national currency. The Dalong Factory was opened with her capital. After speaking, she cried loudly, cursing Ye for being heartless. As a result, under the defense of her defense lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, Judge Jiang still ordered her to be taken back into custody and scheduled the verdict.</p>

<h3>Western Police Forfeit Yesterday, Eastern China Wins Reserve Group Championship</h3>
<p>In the last match of the Western Union Football Reserve Group, Eastern China was to play against the Western Police. The match was originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon at Lu Lane, the outcome of the match, while inconsequential for the Western Police, was crucial for Eastern China in determining whether they would win the championship. Currently, the Portuguese Business Reserve Group, with a record of five wins and two draws in seven matches, had an advantage of point over Eastern China, while Eastern China only had eleven points. Unexpectedly, the Western Police did not show up yesterday, disappointing six to seven thousand spectators. Until the statutory time had passed, there was no sign of the Western Police. The referee, He Chunhui, then announced the Western Police's forfeiture. Eastern China thus gained four points without effort in two consecutive weeks, winning six matches, drawing one, and totaling thirteen points in seven matches, surpassing the Portuguese Business Group with twelve points, and winning the championship of this year's Reserve Group League. The Reserve Group League schedule has now been completed. Last year's Reserve Group Championship was won by the Keers team.</p>

<h3>Chen Bingquan and Others Initiate Hong Kong and Macau Overseas Chinese Calligraphy Competition</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) Years ago, the Ministry of Education ordered all schools to emphasize calligraphy, but many who implemented this were only doing so superficially, and the results were not significant. The situation is even more backward in Hong Kong and Macau. Recently, Chen Bingquan, Chen Gongzhe, and others in Guangzhou initiated the organization of a calligraphy competition for overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Macau in order to promote calligraphy and reverse this declining trend. They received the support of famous calligraphers residing in Hong Kong, such as Xu Shiying, Zheng Hongnian, Qu Jiangong, Deng Erding, Xie Xi, and Li Xiangen. The competition was established immediately, inviting Chen Lifu to be the honorary president, and preparations began.</p>

<h3>The Story of Mr. Zhu Xiaoqin, the Founder of the Jia Lin Scholarship</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Xiaoqin of Shanghai is diligent in business and has achieved remarkable results. He is very frugal in his personal life but enjoys doing good deeds. In memory of his deceased son, Jia Lin, he established a scholarship, which has been ongoing for seven years. Many poor students have benefited from it, and its contribution to society is significant. Therefore, we record Mr. Zhu's "Preface to the Students of the Jia Lin Scholarship" and "Autobiography at Fifty" below:</p>
<p>Preface to the Students of the Jia Lin Scholarship</p>
<p>In the summer of the twenty-fifth year, I established a scholarship in Haining to provide loans to those in the same county who could not afford to attend school. I used the name of my deceased son, Jia Lin, because he died during his school years. In that year, due to the war, I moved to Shanghai and no longer limited the scholarship to those from Haining. As of today, dozens of students have benefited, but I am unable to expand the number due to limited resources, which I regret in my heart. The establishment of the Jia Lin Scholarship was not intended to stop with these students, and I am now fifty years old. People typically live to sixty years. If heaven grants my wish, I will continue this endeavor until I am sixty. However, if I gain only dozens of students in five years, then in another decade, I will have only a little over a hundred students. There is a constant need for education for the children of the world, and I don't know how many there are. What help can my small contribution be? I observe farmers who have lost their husbands. They plant their fields, gaining ten from one, a thousand from a hundred, and generations multiply, covering the fields with abundant crops. In the beginning, they only planted a handful of seeds. I, like that farmer, am foolish in that I want to use the students as seeds, so that they will not only repay their loans after they have completed their studies, but also contribute from their surplus to help others, generation after generation, continuously and without end. Would the students consider my intention to be good? The task is arduous and the road is long, and it must be entrusted to the right people. All of you students have come from a rigorous selection process and are the elite of your time. What doubt do I have? The future impact will be a hundred times greater than it is today. If you students can persevere in your studies, sharpen your ambitions, not be discouraged by the passage of time, not be afraid of difficulties, remember it without forgetting, and act without ceasing, then what is there to worry about? As for those who waste time, indulge themselves, and abandon their ambitions, lacking the ability to stand on their own, how can they help others? I know that you students will never come to this. I urge you students to strive on!</p>
<p>What I entrust to you students is this, and what you students repay me is also this. Then, other students will also be the masters of the Jia Lin Scholarship, and they will help other students. Isn't that wonderful? In the past, when the Old Man of Yugong moved mountains, the wise man laughed at him. Will you students emulate the foolishness of Yugong or the wisdom of the wise man?</p>

<p>A Review of Domestic Debt Issuance Before "August 13th"</p>
<p>Domestic debt in our country originated in the Jiawu Year of the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, with the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Qing government urgently needed funds and raised funds from the people, totaling 11,020,000 taels of silver, at which point it stopped. However, because it did not yet have the form of public debt, it could not be considered purely domestic debt. By the 24th year of the Guangxu reign, the Sino-Japanese War had ended, and the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed, stipulating an indemnity of 100 million taels of silver. According to the treaty, the first installment of 50 million taels was to be paid within six months, and the second installment was to be paid within one year after the treaty was ratified. The remaining amount was to be amortized over six years with an annual interest rate of 5%. If the entire amount could be paid off within three years, the interest could be waived altogether. The Qing government tried every means to raise funds, initially planning to seek loans from abroad, but the terms were too harsh. Subsequently, in that year, it issued "Zhaoxin Stocks," which marked the beginning of domestic debt issuance in China. The fixed amount was 100 million taels, but due to the lack of public awareness and the Qing government's lack of credibility with the people, the amount raised was less than 5 million taels. At the end of the Xuantong reign, the revolution broke out, and the Qing government's treasury was empty. It then issued 30 million yuan of 5% Patriotic Public Bonds to meet urgent needs, but few people subscribed. Although forced fundraising was later carried out in provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan, the total amount raised, including subscriptions from various princes and high-ranking officials, was only 1,646,790 yuan. Since the change of dynasty, natural disasters have occurred frequently, and internal wars have been incessant. The national finances have been exceptionally depleted. The government has thus regarded the issuance of public debt as the only way to provide emergency relief and financial support. This can be described in three periods:</p>
<p>(1) From the Founding of the Republic to 1921: During this period, the domestic debt issued by the Ministry of Finance of the former Beijing government included the following eight types (in thousands of yuan):</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned domestic debts, except for the 3rd Year Domestic Public Bonds, the 4th Year Domestic Public Bonds, and the 7th Year Short-Term Public Bonds, which had definite guarantee funds, the rest were completely unsecured. Later, the Ministry of Finance of the Beijing government adopted the suggestions of domestic financiers and implemented the consolidation of domestic debt. On the one hand, it allocated funds to repay the 3rd Year, 4th Year, and 7th Year Short-Term Public Bonds. On the other hand, it converted the domestic debt issued in the 1st Year and 8th Year of the Republic at 40% of their face value in May and June of 1921, respectively, into Consolidated 6% Bonds amounting to 54,392,228 yuan and Consolidated 7% Bonds amounting to 13,600,000 yuan. For the remaining debts, the terms for repayment of principal were determined appropriately and strictly implemented. This was the first consolidation of domestic public debt in our country.</p>
<p>(2) From 1921 to 1932: During this period, in addition to the Consolidated 6%, Consolidated 7%, and 7th Year 6% bonds that had not yet been fully repaid after the first domestic debt consolidation, the former Ministry of Finance of the Beijing government and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government successively issued as many as 25 types. A list is shown below (in thousands of yuan):</p>
<p>From the establishment of the National Government in 1927 until February 1932, the principal and interest of the above-mentioned bonds were repaid on schedule. As a result, securities trading on the stock exchange was extremely developed, almost becoming the investment center of the country. After "September 18th" (the Mukden Incident), tax revenue decreased, and the bond market declined. By the time of the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident in 1932, the government's finances became even more difficult. At this time, rumors arose, claiming that the government would soon suspend the payment of principal and interest on bonds. As a result, liquidity in the bond market declined rapidly. Fortunately, the holders of various domestic bonds were deeply aware of the importance of the situation and voluntarily sacrificed their own interests to cooperate with the government. Thus, the extension and interest reduction measures of February 24, 1932, were realized. This was the second consolidation of domestic debt in our country.</p>
<p>(3) From 1932 to the "August 13th" Incident: During this period, the National Government conducted the third consolidation of Chinese domestic debt in February 1936. From February 1932 until the eve of the third consolidation, the domestic bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance included the following ten types (in thousands of yuan):</p>
<p>As of the end of January 1936, the Ministry of Finance's domestic debt obligations, excluding the 17th Year Rehabilitation Short-Term Bonds (which were about to mature), the Long-Term Financial Public Bonds (which had very long repayment terms), and the Haihe Public Bonds (which had separately secured funds), consisted of 21 types of domestic bonds that had not yet matured. Adding the above-mentioned 12 types of bonds issued successively from January 1932 to January 1936 (the guarantee funds for the Yuping Road Public Bonds and the 24th Year Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds were paid from local tax revenues in Shanxi, which are not included here), there were as many as 33 types, with a total debt of 1,460 million yuan and monthly principal and interest payments amounting to 15 million yuan. On February 1, 1936, all were consolidated into 1,460 million yuan of Unified Public Bonds. The original bond names ceased to exist from then on. The main points of the issuance of the Unified Public Bonds, as stated in the regulations, are listed below:</p>
<p>1.  The total amount of the Unified Public Bonds was 1,460 million yuan, to be exchanged for existing bond certificates of various types according to the length of their original maturity periods, as follows:</p>
<p>Unified Series A: Exchanged for six types, including the 22nd Year Patriotic Treasury Bills, totaling 150 million yuan.</p>
<p>Unified Series B: Exchanged for five types, including the 19th Year Rehabilitation Treasury Bills, totaling 150 million yuan.</p>
<p>Unified Series C: Exchanged for nine types, including the 18th Year Deficit Treasury Bills, totaling 150 million yuan.</p>
<p>Unified Series D: Exchanged for eight types, including the 19th Year Customs Revenue Public Bonds, totaling 550 million yuan.</p>
<p>Unified Series E: Exchanged for five types, including the 23rd Year Consolidated Tax Treasury Bills, totaling 260 million yuan.</p>
<p>2.  The interest rate was uniformly changed to 6%.</p>
<p>3.  The repayment terms were 12 years for Series A, 5 years for Series B, 18 years for Series C, 21 years for Series D, and 24 years for Series E. Principal would be repaid by lottery every six months in each series.</p>
<p>4.  The principal and interest repayment funds for the Unified Public Bonds would still be allocated from customs revenue, as originally stipulated for the existing bonds.</p>
<p>This time, the Ministry of Finance issued Unified Public Bonds to exchange for old debts, saving approximately 85 million yuan in debt expenses each year. This great measure can be considered the most memorable page in the history of public debt in our country! From then until the "August 13th" Incident, the domestic debts that our country continued to issue, which were issued by the Ministry of Finance and secured by consolidated taxes, included the 340 million yuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds of March 1, 1936; the 15 million yuan Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds of April 1, 1936, secured by the salt tax of Sichuan Province; and the 11 million yuan Guangdong Financial Consolidation Public Bonds of October 1, 1936.</p>
<h3>Seen, Heard, Thought</h3>
<p>In the past, when the situation became tense, it was rare to see advertisements for the sale, rental, or transfer of real estate in the newspapers. Now, the situation is even more tense, but these types of advertisements have suddenly increased. This change indicates the future of real estate and, at the same time, the future of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Someone would rather sell several bags of rice to a certain party every month at the purchase price in order to obtain the possibility of hoarding rice in Pudong. If you say he is devoid of conscience, he will laugh at your naiveté. This newspaper pointed out very early that the rice weevils in the concession area were colluding with a certain party outside the concession area, working together to manipulate the rice price in this city.</p>
<p>As the clamor for a thorough investigation of the rice in the warehouses grew louder, the news "leaked" that most of the rice was hoarded in Pudong. It is a fact that some of it is hoarded in Pudong, but the intention of revealing this information at this time is to make people believe in the difficulty of "being unable to carry out a rice inventory investigation" and to dismiss the unanimous public opinion demanding a "thorough investigation of the rice in the warehouses."</p>
<p>New Domestic Debt Issued by Our Country After "August 13th"</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the expenditure on war expenses has been extremely high! The funds needed for national construction are extremely large. The largest sources of tax revenue in our country on a normal day are customs, salt, and consolidated taxes, but at this time, they have successively fallen into enemy hands. The government has issued seven types of domestic public bonds successively, and the people of the whole country, having a sense of obligation to contribute money and effort, are happy to subscribe and enthusiastically contribute. The contents of these seven types of domestic public bonds are:</p>
<p>(1) National Salvation Public Bonds: Issued on September 1, 1937, at 100% of face value, with a total amount of 500 million national currency units. The annual interest rate is 4%, to be paid once a year at the end of August starting in 1938. Repayment of principal will begin in 1941 and will be repaid over 30 years, with one lottery drawing each year to repay principal. The guarantee fund will be allocated from national treasury revenue.</p>
<p>(2) 1937 Guangxi Financial Consolidation Public Bonds: The total amount of this public bond is 17 million yuan, issued by the Ministry of Finance in December 1937. An annual allocation of 1.2 million yuan from Guangxi Province's salt tax will be used as a guarantee fund.</p>
<p>(3) 1938 National Defense Public Bonds: The fixed amount is 500 million yuan, issued on May 1, 1938, at 100% of face value, with an annual interest rate of 6%. Starting from May 1, 1939, payments will be made annually, with lottery drawings for repayment of principal twice a year, on October 31 and April 30, until all principal is repaid by April 3, 1969. All funds for the repayment of principal and interest will be secured by all income tax revenue.</p>
<p>(4) 1938 Disaster Relief Public Bonds, First Tranche: The fixed amount is 30 million national currency units, issued on July 1, 1938, at 98% of face value, with an annual interest rate of 4%. Starting from July 1, 1939, payments of principal and interest will be made twice a year until all principal is repaid by June 30, 1961. The payment fund will be guaranteed by the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund, and the principal repayment fund will be allocated from national treasury revenue.</p>
<p>(5) 1939 Construction Public Bonds: The fixed amount is 600 million yuan, to be issued in two tranches, with 300 million yuan issued on April 1 and August 1, respectively. The interest rate is 6%, and the term is 25 years. The surplus profits from various state-owned enterprises that have already been established or are newly established, as well as special construction funds levied under the salt tax, are designated as the fund for repayment of principal and interest. If these are insufficient, the national treasury will allocate funds to cover the shortfall.</p>
<p>(6) 1939 Military Supplies Public Bonds: The total amount is 600 million yuan, with 300 million yuan issued on June 1 and October 1, 1939, respectively. The annual interest rate is 6%. For the first two years from the date of issuance, only interest will be paid. After two years, principal and interest will be repaid twice a year until all principal is repaid by the end of May and September 1966, respectively. The fund will be secured by consolidated taxes and taxes on tobacco and alcohol.</p>
<p>(7) 1940 Military Supplies Public Bonds: The total amount is 1,200 million yuan, with 600 million yuan issued on March 1 and September 1, 1940, respectively. The annual interest rate is 6%. For the first two years from the date of issuance, only interest will be paid. Repayment of principal will begin in 1943 and will be amortized over 25 years, with lottery drawings for repayment of principal every six months. The fund will be allocated from national treasury revenue.</p>
<p>As of today, the total amount of various domestic public bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance with definite guarantees, including the old debts from before "August 13th," is 18 types. Among them, 13 types are directly secured by the central government's revenue, and the other 5 types are secured by the revenue of various provinces. The current outstanding balances of each bond are listed in the following table (in thousands of yuan):</p>
<p>(A) Secured by Central Government Revenue:</p>
<p>(B) Secured by Local Government Revenue:</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of Domestic Debt Prices</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the extension and interest reduction measures in 1932, the funds for our domestic public debt have been uniformly covered by customs revenue. Each month, the Inspector General of Customs allocates funds to the National Debt Fund Management Committee for deposit and payment. Since then, even though the central government's finances have been in an extremely difficult period, the repayment of principal and interest on domestic debt has never been delayed, so its creditworthiness has increased day by day. In June 1937, the price of the five types of Unified Public Bonds reached the highest record since the opening of trading, filling the future of securities trading in our country with optimistic air. But since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the bond market has been showing signs of instability. In early August, in order to prevent speculators from manipulating the market, the government specifically set minimum prices for the five types of Unified Public Bonds, with Series A at 76 yuan, Series B at 73.5 yuan, Series C at 71.5 yuan, and Series D and E each at 70 yuan. Later, with the start of the Shanghai Battle, the stock exchange was ordered to close, but the price in over-the-counter trading had already shown a downward trend. But later, due to the consolidation of our country's wartime finance and the government's efforts to maintain unwavering creditworthiness, coupled with the improvement of the war situation and the expansion of international aid to China, the over-the-counter price gradually rebounded after reaching its lowest record in January 1938. Although there have been fluctuations from time to time, the general trend has indeed been gradually improving. As of today, the price of the Unified Bonds has not only exceeded the specified limit price, but is also not far from the highest record before the war! Now, let us take Unified Series A as an example to record the rise and fall of its market price since January 1938. As for the rise and fall of the prices of the other four types, it is not difficult for us to infer from this one example.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>When any modern country encounters war with foreign countries, the methods of raising war funds in a hurry are nothing more than borrowing, inflating the currency, increasing taxes, and issuing public debt. Based on China's national conditions and the precedents of various countries, issuing public debt is the most appropriate method. In order to make it easier to absorb, our government has not made large-scale issuances, and it uses a system of solicitation and free purchase, in order to ensure that the use of social funds is not affected by it. In total, in the four years of war, the total amount of the seven types of domestic debt issued by our country is only 3,447 million yuan. Adding the 100 million units of Customs Gold Bonds, 10 million pounds of British Gold Bonds, 50 million dollars of US Gold Bonds in the 1938 Gold Public Bonds, and 10 million pounds of British Gold Bonds, 50 million dollars of US Gold Bonds in the 1940 Construction Gold Public Bonds, compared with Japan's 26 billion public debt, this number is not too much. Is this not an important reason why our country's finance has always been able to remain in a consolidated state since the war began?</p>

<h3>Potatoes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>To be honest, potatoes have been transformed from wild to domesticated plants in Chile and Peru for at least two thousand years. However, if it weren't for the promotion by the Spanish, it might still be confined to a narrow area in the Andes Mountains, never seen by the world! The Spanish first brought it to their country along with sweet potatoes, but because the Iberian Peninsula also has a subtropical climate, sweet potatoes immediately had the opportunity to develop, thrive, and flourish as if they were at home, which also aroused the love of Spanish farmers. Potatoes, on the other hand, were in a lower position and were a bit frustrated. Even now, Spanish farmers only plant potatoes occasionally, with a bit of a "presenting new offerings" feeling. Later, the Spanish sent potatoes as "staple food" to Mexico and northern America to supply the people who were developing colonies. That was great! The potato finally found its place and encountered a suitable environment! Especially in what is now the state of Virginia, the famous British explorer Drake discovered it in the area and brought it back to Great Britain in 1586. Later, Walter Raleigh followed closely, – the famous figure who flattered Queen Elizabeth by spreading his long coat on the muddy water to allow her to walk across it! – also transported potatoes from Virginia to his homeland. Therefore, around 1600 AD, potatoes were already strangely admired and appreciated by the English and Irish! Later, a botanist named John Gerarde promoted and publicized potatoes and also tried to plant them near London. As a result, potatoes gradually became popular throughout England. Soon, parts of Germany and eastern France also had traces of potatoes. As for the Italian Peninsula, due to the relationship between Spain and the Roman Court, which worshiped the old religion, priests carried and offered them, so they also obtained potato seeds from another route.</p>
<p>However, in the early 17th century, potatoes were mostly used as feed for livestock, and their use as food for humans was met with extremely strong opposition. This was actually because most of the tuberous plants similar to them contained the most violent toxins. Take France, for example. King Louis XIII was willing to spread potatoes widely among the people. In 1616, he set an example by using them as imperial meals. King Louis XIV also had them as a daily staple, but it didn't have much effect at all. It was a pharmacist and agricultural economist named Parmentier who used a little trick to spread the word about potatoes! It turned out that Parmentier was the most enthusiastic advocate of this precious plant. In 1771, the research institute in the Besangon region of eastern France offered a reward for "plants that could replace food in lean years" because of the famine. Parmentier's dissertation recommending potatoes was selected. In 1778, he also published his book on the chemical examination of potatoes. But it wasn't until 1785 that he received the support of King Louis XVI and the Royal Agricultural Society to plant his beloved plant on a plain called Sablons in northern Paris. When the potatoes were about to ripen, Parmentier deliberately asked the king to send a team of soldiers to guard the field. As soon as the news spread, everyone was stirred: What precious things are they that are worth the king using troops to protect? So, the more they were forbidden, the more they wanted to get their hands on them. Some people sneaked into the area at night to dig them up, but the soldiers deliberately pretended to be deaf and dumb, letting them carry them away. After everyone tried them, they found that they were not only non-toxic but also very delicious, so potatoes quickly became popular among the entire population.</p>
<p>Now everyone knows how important potatoes are in the food of Europeans and Americans! Just take the island of Ireland as an example: Potatoes are almost the only food for the residents. Therefore, around 1846 AD, Ireland suffered from a potato famine, and thousands of people starved to death, and more than one million people left their hometowns and fled to foreign lands! No wonder the English botanist Gerarde, the hero who spread potatoes, wanted people to carve his portrait holding a potato flower to show his achievements!</p>
<p>It is not yet certain when potatoes were introduced into China. I think it was after the opening of the five treaty ports, when priests or merchants occasionally brought them here. However, potatoes in China are indeed very suitable for the local soil and climate, and there will definitely be unlimited development in the future. We still need to increase our promotion and popularization efforts!</p>

<h3>Domestic Pigment Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Domestic pigments have gradually increased in price due to scarce inventory. Yesterday, the market discussion showed a further increase. For example, lead powder increased by 20 to several tens of yuan, cinnabar increased by 200 yuan, and vermilion increased by 400 yuan. The market prices of various types are as follows (market price per dan):</p>

<h3>Corn</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Rice prices are rising day by day, and families in the middle and lower classes are sighing over having to count the grains of rice to cook! However, people cannot live without food for a day. Since rice prices have risen, they can only eat other foods to fill their stomachs, such as flour and miscellaneous grains. However, flour is also expensive. A relatively cheaper option is corn, which can be mixed with other foods to save a lot of money on expenses. I very much agree with the text in the economic news in this newspaper, such as "Unable to Afford Rice, Switching to Corn."</p>
<p>Corn is also called "baogu," "yushushu," and "lusu." In Shanghai, it is called "zhenzhu mi" (pearl rice). According to the "Shu Shu" section of the "Compendium of Materia Medica," "Shu Shu (sorghum) was first planted in Shu, hence the name Shu Shu. Taste: sweet, astringent, warm, non-toxic. Main treatment: warms the middle, astringes the intestines and stomach, stops cholera, etc. It is now planted in the north to prepare for grain shortages and to feed cattle and horses. The tallest variety is called 'lu qie' by southerners. It is suitable to be sown in the spring and harvested in the autumn. The stems are about ten feet high and resemble reeds but are solid inside. The leaves also resemble reed catkins, large like belts. The grains are as large as peppercorns and are red and black. The rice is firm and solid. There are two types, yellow and red. The sticky ones can be mixed with glutinous rice to brew wine and make bait. The non-sticky ones can be made into cakes and cooked into porridge, which can relieve famine, raise livestock, and be used as brooms. The stems can be woven into mats and fences and used for cooking, which is most beneficial to the people." The "Yu Shu Shu" section says, "Yu Shu Shu (corn) originated in the West. Its seedlings and leaves are similar to Shu Shu but are fat and short. They are also similar to Job's tears. The seedlings are three to four feet high and flower in June or July, forming ears like husked wheat. A pod grows separately from the center of the seedling, like a fish's shape. White whiskers hang down from the pod. After a long time, the pod splits open and the kernels come out, clustered together... Taste: sweet, neutral, non-toxic. Main treatment: regulates the middle and opens the stomach. The roots and leaves, when boiled into juice and drunk, relieve frequent and difficult urination. When burned into ashes and taken with wine, it is effective in treating difficult childbirth," and so on. From this, we can see that corn can relieve famine, as evidenced by previous statements, and it is also very beneficial to the body. The so-called "Shu Shu" and "Yu Shu Shu," according to the "Compendium of Materia Medica," are probably "ben lusu" (native sorghum) and "yang xi su" (foreign millet). Some people also call it "six grains." There is a saying, "After eating five grains, you want six grains," to compare the insufficiency of the human heart. The name "pearl rice" is the most elegant and is also true to its name, because as reported, corn is now as expensive as pearls. In these years, it is indeed difficult to live because rice is as expensive as pearls and firewood as expensive as cassia! As for how to eat it, grinding it into flour and cooking it into porridge with vegetable hearts is very palatable. Please buy it and try it.</p>
<h3>The Colors of Clothes</h3>
<p>— Si</p>
<p>The colors of clothes have a close relationship with women. Every young girl often says, "What color suits me best?" So I will talk about the characteristics of various colors.</p>
<p>Red – Red is the most exciting color. It can express a lively psychology. Not only does the person wearing it feel refreshed, but the person looking at it also feels excited. Every woman can wear red, unless you are neurasthenic or the color does not harmonize with your skin tone.</p>
<p>Green – Green represents youth, peace, and freedom. Grass green is a symbol of fresh air outdoors. A woman who often works in an office can wear a grass-green dress to regulate her spirits. It is also very suitable to wear at home.</p>
<p>Yellow – Yellow is the color that children love the most. Therefore, when a woman wears yellow clothes, in addition to expressing her youthful beauty, she can also arouse children's goodwill.</p>
<p>Black – Black can show a dignified appearance. Wearing black clothes is very generous, but it is not very suitable for tall, thin, and dark-skinned women.</p>
<p>Brown – Brown can also express a leisurely outdoor atmosphere. It is especially suitable for women under the age of twenty-five, but a solid brown color is very monotonous, so you must have yellow or orange-yellow accents.</p>
<h3>Proclamation to Unscrupulous Second Landlords of the Isolated Island</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Shanghai's prosperity leads the nation, where land is truly worth its weight in gold, hence the high cost of rent surpasses other places. There has long been lament about the difficulty of living in Shanghai. Since the National Army retreated westward two years ago, turning the area into an isolated island, compatriots from the occupied territories with some financial means have flocked to the concessions to seek refuge. Consequently, rents have become even more exorbitant. Most first landlords are reasonable and their rent increases are limited. However, second landlords are the most detestable, driven by insatiable greed. Before renting, they impose all sorts of conditions: families with children are rejected for being troublesome, large families are rejected for being too crowded, and those without guarantors are rejected out of fear of unpaid rent. Other demands include wanting tips or requiring advance payments, the list of outrageous demands is endless. After renting, they impose all sorts of restrictions: regulations on the minimum brightness of light bulbs, prohibition of turning them on early or off late, and prohibition of cooking outdoors due to the foul smell of coal stoves. Even a tiny attic room or lean-to can cost twenty or thirty yuan in rent, with constant attempts to raise it. Therefore, ordinary middle-class refugees pay dozens of yuan in rent for a dwelling where they eat, sleep, and relieve themselves. Besides a bed, a table, cooking utensils, and a chamber pot, there is no room to move. Their hardship is beyond words. My friend, Mr. Yuan Jianmei, since his hometown of Pinghu fell, moved to Shanghai with his family and has already suffered such hardship. Yesterday, when discussing this, he sighed repeatedly and composed twelve seven-character quatrains, vividly detailing his personal suffering without omission. They are transcribed below, hoping that second landlords, after reading them, will be moved by conscience and show some consideration for third-party tenants:</p>
<p>(1) Obtaining good land, yearly rent is insufficient,</p>
<p>How can the harvest compare to the second landlord's gains?</p>
<p>The people suffer greatly, displaced and impoverished,</p>
<p>Relying on buildings to generate wealth, uniquely different.</p>
<p>(2) Barely escaped the dust of calamity to a celestial harbor,</p>
<p>A haven by the sea, a good place to avoid Qin.</p>
<p>Don't say it's not easy to live in Chang'an,</p>
<p>Every inch of land is worth its weight in gold in Spring Shen.</p>
<p>(3) Renting a house, mostly to escape disaster,</p>
<p>Looking back, our former home is already ashes.</p>
<p>A shoulder pole of luggage, three or two people,</p>
<p>Crying is forbidden, especially if bringing children.</p>
<p>(4) Many people, few houses, it's a favorable situation to seize,</p>
<p>Once the tenant leaves, the price increases again.</p>
<p>Before the previous tenant moves out, the next one arrives,</p>
<p>See who is quick and ascends first.</p>
<p>(5) Morning and evening indistinguishable, crowded and cramped,</p>
<p>Confined and restricted, we temporarily lodge here.</p>
<p>Besides setting up a bed and cooking utensils,</p>
<p>Even a screen or a small table is hard to accommodate.</p>
<p>(6) Borrowing a small space under the eaves,</p>
<p>Thirty yuan is the asking price, no bargaining.</p>
<p>If rent payment is even three days late,</p>
<p>The order to evict is issued with an authoritative voice.</p>
<p>(7) Electric lights are only allowed nine candlepower,</p>
<p>Strict rules for turning them off early or on late.</p>
<p>Who is responsible for the leaking roof flooding the bed?</p>
<p>The cost of hiring workers to repair it is borne by the tenant.</p>
<p>(8) Burning firewood is not allowed, causing smoke,</p>
<p>Move the cooking stove outside.</p>
<p>If a guest stays overnight,</p>
<p>The fine for violating the quota is three thousand.</p>
<p>(9) Taking advantage of burning to loot, as the saying goes,</p>
<p>More greedy and evil than a cunning merchant by tenfold.</p>
<p>Not allowing a single inch of leeway,</p>
<p>A fellow countryman, ashamed to live among them.</p>
<p>(10) Renting other people's houses, farming other people's fields,</p>
<p>Though the harvest is plentiful, how many years can one enjoy it?</p>
<p>When peace returns to the Central Plains one day,</p>
<p>Who will care, who will pity?</p>
<p>(11) Landlords are mostly generous,</p>
<p>Rent increases are still averaging at ten percent.</p>
<p>Rice and coal subsidies are jointly contested and helped,</p>

<h3>Insights on Infant Care</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Nursing an infant can be said to be an easy task, but it can also be said to be a difficult one. If the infant's mother has milk and is willing to breastfeed, then naturally there is no problem. However, if she does not have milk, or if she has milk but is not willing to breastfeed exclusively, then it is not an easy matter to resolve. Employing a wet nurse requires attention to her milk quantity and quality, as well as her physical condition and temperament, as these are all extremely important for the infant's health. Furthermore, even if all of the above are not problems, the wet nurse's level of knowledge is generally shallow, and she is even more ignorant of infant care methods, sometimes even smothering the infant to death. Isn't this very dangerous? Since hiring a wet nurse is not a good solution, one can only resort to milk substitutes. However, there are a bewildering variety of milk substitutes, and imported products are too expensive. Choosing one is also a troublesome task. According to my family's experience, the domestic product "Anjian'er Pure Lipid Milk Powder" is of excellent quality and has the same effect as breast milk. It is very convenient to prepare and drink, leaves no sediment, and is very affordable. All the infants in my family have been fed with Anjian'er milk powder, and they are all lively and healthy, which is a joy to behold. For families with infants, why not give it a try?

<h3>A Week's Worth of Home-Style Meal Plans</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Among the vegetables these days, rapeseed is the most delicious, both sweet and tender, costing eight cents per pound, which is relatively inexpensive. Therefore, almost every day we have rapeseed on our dining table, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. For non-vegetarian dishes, we like to stir-fry it with sliced meat, adding bamboo shoot slices and shredded ham. With green, white, and red colors, it looks very appetizing when served. In addition, stir-fried beef slices or stir-fried shrimp, with a little water chestnut flour, are very flavorful. For vegetarian dishes, simple stir-frying is the most common. Sometimes, when the old lady eats vegetarian, we add bamboo shoot slices and shiitake mushroom slices to make her very satisfied.</p>

<h3>Journey Through Zhejiang and Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Paul</p>
<p>Since the coastal ports were blockaded, today the only way to travel between Zhejiang and Shanghai is through the port of Shipu. A guest who came from Yongkang described the hardships along the way. Here is a summary to help those traveling to the interior.</p>
<p>Day 1: From Yongkang to Xikou: There is a direct bus from Jinhua to Xikou that passes through Yongkang. The fare from Yongkang to Xikou is 35 yuan per person, but the tickets are difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>Day 2: From Xikou to Ningbo: In the morning, hire sedan chairs to depart from Xikou, costing 7 yuan per item. Arrive at Jiangkou at noon. After lunch, hire a foot-rowed boat, costing 10 yuan per boat. Entering the river from the sea requires passing a dam, where a long chain is used to pull the boat up, which is extremely dangerous. Arrive in Ningbo in the evening. Stay at the Anping Hotel, costing 2 yuan per day. However, meals are extraordinarily expensive, with one serving of plain rice costing 1.30 yuan.</p>
<p>Day 3: Inquire about the route to Shipu and stay in Ningbo.</p>
<p>Day 4: Hire a small boat and depart at 10 PM. Arrive in Hengxi the next morning. The boat is incredibly filthy, full of bugs and fleas.</p>
<p>Day 5: From Hengxi to Xizhou: In the morning, hire rickshaws from Hengxi, costing 10 yuan per rickshaw. Travel for five hours to Xianghe Tan for lunch. Switch to a small sailboat to cross Xiangshan Port. The boat fare is 3 to 4 yuan per person. Arrive in Xizhou after four hours and stay overnight at the Changyu Hotel.</p>
<p>Day 6: From Xizhou to Shipu: The distance is 120 li. Hire sedan chairs in the morning, costing 30 yuan per ride. Pass over nine mountain ridges, among which the Eight Ridges and Three Ridges are the most dangerous. It is said that bandits often appear. Arrive in Shipu at night and stay at the New Asia Hotel, costing 3 yuan per person per day. Meals are outside, costing 3 yuan per person per meal.</p>
<p>Days 7 to 10: Stay in Shipu waiting for the boat.</p>
<p>Day 10: Board the Gaodeng ship at night. Cabin class is 50 yuan per person, medium bunk is 15 yuan per person, and small bunk is 4 to 5 yuan. Meals are provided on the ship, but they are unpalatable. The ship travels for over 30 hours and stops outside Wusong Port.</p>
<p>Days 13 to 18: The ship stops outside the port for sulfur fumigation to prevent plague. Every morning, customs officials board the ship to inspect. If there are any deaths, the ship will be detained for 40 days before being allowed to enter the port.</p>
<p>Day 18: Enter the port at night. At 10:15, the ship docks at the Astronomical Observatory Pier, and we are finally able to disembark.</p>

<h3>Superficiality</h3>
<p>— Juehui</p>
<p>Speaking human language to humans, speaking ghost language to ghosts: being flowery and flattering to good people, being humble and subservient to bad people... although the methods vary in subtlety, they are all forms of superficiality.</p>
<p>Superficiality can be big or small, but it remains superficiality.</p>
<p>Meeting an acquaintance on the street, "The weather is really nice today, hahaha..." This is small superficiality, which doesn't matter much.</p>
<p>A poor person is starving to death, and the "head of the family" strolls out, "Don't worry, I will find a way to lower the rice price." The tone is quite "solemn."</p>
<p>Turning his head, a "big belly" one hand holding a "ticket" and the other holding a "knife"... "Of course, of course! If we don't hoard at this time, when will we? Hahaha..."</p>
<p>This is, however, big superficiality. Not only "matters a lot," but also tens of thousands (probably more) statements of death!</p>
<p>Superficiality, "hahaha," only makes the "unscrupulous" even more "unrestrained"!</p>
<h3>"Amahs"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zimang</p>
<p>After Mrs. Pan watched the "amah" leave with her blue floral cloth bag, she immediately retracted that ferocious, angry expression; but her eyebrows were still knitted together.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pan deeply felt that she lacked strategies for dealing with "amahs." The New Year's bonus was so much, and she still complained it was too little. She had barely completed a "hao tou" (a fixed term of employment) when she abruptly announced, like a "lightning strike," that she had received a letter from her hometown and needed to go back to farm. Mrs. Pan was truly caught between laughter and tears and couldn't help but vent her anger, scolding her fiercely with glaring eyes. But the "amah" always maintained a slight smile and eventually left, which made Mrs. Pan a little heartbroken. Moreover, she had to start looking for an "amah" again—a very difficult task that always gave Mrs. Pan a headache.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pan was good at using the abacus, so she cooked dinner herself and instructed Boss Zhang of the employment agency to send an "amah" the next day.</p>
<p>The next morning, an "amah" was brought by Boss Zhang. Mrs. Pan sized up the new maid from head to toe. She had an oval face, her hair was slicked back, and she wore a new-ish, navy-blue cheongsam over black wool crepe silk pants. This made Mrs. Pan's anger rise three zhang (about ten meters): "More beautiful than the mistress! Ugh, even wears rouge! Humph!" She wanted to refuse her outright, but Boss Zhang had already said, "Try her out." Mrs. Pan thought that the toilets hadn't been emptied yet, and having a beautiful maid could also enhance the mistress's prestige, so she might as well give it a try.</p>
<p>This fashionable "amah" was very obedient on the first day, following orders without question. What pleased Mrs. Pan was that she ate very little, only two small bowls of rice. As for the dishes—one bite of vegetables for every three bites of rice—she perfectly met Mrs. Pan's standard for choosing an "amah." Mrs. Pan had a trick: it didn't matter if the salary was a little higher, as long as the "amah" ate less rice, preferably with a vegetarian's piety. Then, the amount of rice saved would be significant, and she wouldn't have to worry about her stealing food.</p>
<p>However, reality differed greatly from the ideal. The new "amah" asked for leave to go out on the second night. Mrs. Pan was extremely suspicious, feeling like several coal briquettes were missing from the brazier. However, Mrs. Pan was patient. But on the third day, the "amah" upstairs secretly told Mrs. Pan that the "amah" had won money playing mahjong and was saying bad things about the "mistress," complaining that the dishes were bad, always just a bowl of soybean sprouts or vegetables.</p>
<p>Of course, without any "approvals," Mrs. Pan immediately issued an order, spent a few cents to send the new maid away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pan decided to start with "country goods," as they were more honest than "old Shanghai," easier to control, and easier to restrain.</p>
<p>So, Boss Zhang sent another "authentic" country woman who had "just arrived in Shanghai yesterday."</p>
<p>She was a woman with a sallow complexion, a loud voice, a patched cotton-padded jacket, and a blue square patch on the heel of her cloth socks—in short, a middle-aged country woman who didn't understand the term "amah" and had simply come to the city to earn a living.</p>
<p>She certainly worked sincerely. Mrs. Pan seized the opportunity to put the heavy work on this "amah's" shoulders: after mopping the floor, she had to wash two quilts. However, she ate three large bowls of rice, no less. After eating, she would start working again without saying a word, completely displaying her simple and honest nature.</p>
<p>When Mrs. Pan lifted the rice pot, she knew that the "standard" had been "breached"—Mrs. Pan seemed to see a bottomless pit and was startled. Not only did she not have a stomach illness, not only was she not vegetarian, but she ate so much! Three big bowls of rice—the more Mrs. Pan thought about it, the more she thought it was unworthy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pan suddenly told the country woman to leave, quickly, to avoid eating another dinner.</p>
<p>The country woman, in pain and confusion, dragged her weary steps and walked away, dejectedly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Pan angrily slumped onto the faded sofa cushion. She was also quite tired, troubled by the search for a loyal, hardworking, and light-eating "amah" who would work like a "beast of burden"...</p>
<h3>Random Jottings</h3>
<p>— Wenqiang</p>
<p>(1) The Long Snake Formation</p>
<p>Every morning, when I walk past the intersection of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road, I see countless common citizens standing in front of a Taoist association's door, lined up in a long snake formation, waiting to buy inexpensive state rice. I want to tell people, and keep telling people (until the long snake formation disappears), that the long snake formation here is growing longer every day! Now that the price of state rice has raced past one hundred yuan, the long snake formation will inevitably break all previous records!</p>
<h3>"One Ounce of Gold, Four Ounces of Luck"</h3>
<p>— Weiyang</p>
<p>In this modern age of flourishing science, logically, those who believe in fate should have disappeared. But in fact, it is not the case. Not only do the Buddha-chanting old women in remote villages still believe that "this life's suffering is due to a lack of cultivation in the previous life," but even the adults and gentlemen in large cities believe that fate has its place. Otherwise, the maintenance of social order would be even more difficult. In their minds, "fate" is used to supplement the inadequacies of the military police and laws.</p>
<p>So, missionaries have work to do, and fortune tellers don't have to worry about going hungry. As for those who toil all day but can't get enough to eat, what else can they say but blame their bad fate?</p>
<p>Do you envy people who live in foreign-style houses and drive cars? "One ounce of gold, four ounces of luck; see if you, a ragged and penniless wretch, have that kind of luck!"</p>
<p>People with luck can be recognized at a glance. The big-bellied wealthy merchants and the round-faced rich old men are the most obvious symbols. Do you have this fortunate appearance?</p>
<p>Yesterday, the manager said, "Those who sit facing outwards must have luck!"</p>
<p>Do you have this luck?</p>
<p>If you have none of these, then even if you suffer for a lifetime, you can't blame others. Because one ounce of gold has to be exchanged for four ounces of luck, isn't that clear enough?</p>
<p>But I always doubt this saying, because besides "appearance," there is also "conscience"!</p>
<h3>Chalk Life</h3>
<p>— Chen Qi</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(5) The Dividing Line Between Love and Desire</p>
<p>Love—this is truly the most elusive thing in the world! Many people say that it doesn't exist at all. The so-called love between parents, siblings, and children is purely a combination of interests. Separated from interests, love absolutely will not exist between them. Furthermore, the relationship between men and women, which has always been recognized as the easiest to generate the enzymes of love, if you were to take them completely apart, then all that you could see would be nothing more than the pursuit of desire. Of course, many people disagree with such extreme arguments, because facts tell us that throughout history, no one knows how many citizens have nobly sacrificed everything for their country; how many parents have tragically sacrificed themselves for their children; how many children have bravely sacrificed all their happiness for their parents; and countless devoted men and women willingly endure all kinds of pain for another person, even depressed and haggard, dying bloody, dying shattered, dying decapitated... Isn't this not something that can be promoted by just the pursuit of interest or carnal desire! Clearly there is a kind of wonderful great power between them, what is it? Besides love, there is nothing else in the world can generate such a magic in the heat!</p>
<p>However, humans are too clever, gradually abusing this most precious love at will, even using it as a cover to do all sorts of things that are absolutely contrary to love. As a result, our eyes become blurred, money, vanity, and lust are all mixed together with love. Even the smartest people sometimes feel unable to distinguish, just like trying to find a hair that truly belongs to you on the floor of a barbershop.</p>
<p>For someone who performs in operas, love is especially a question. For them, singing operas every day, the plots of joy, sorrow, separation, and reunion, rotate through their inspiration time and time again like recycled food, finally numbing their senses. What is a fake play, what is a true story, they simply cannot distinguish. To hope for true love to grow from their hearts is almost as difficult as hoping for rice to grow in a stone field. Even if they happen to develop a genuine love for someone exceptionally, people won't believe them, because their expressions on stage are too good. Once they are off stage, no matter how enthusiastic they are, they won't be better than they are on stage, and people will always consider it as a false gesture!</p>
