<p>二十八日華盛頓電　羅斯福總統爲蔣委員長推荐拉狄麼爲其個人之政治顧問、拉狄摩氏行將離美來華、按氏一丸三八年以來、任美國的翰霍布金大學拜吉氏國際關係硏究院理事、而一九三四年時、巳任太平洋問題季刋編輯、憔向未任職政府、其政治評論家之盛名、係源於其長期居住中國及廣泛旅行、並對於中國人民生活深切了解、與夫對於中國人民願望之同情、拉狄摩氏且爲滿蒙問題國際評論家之權威、對於中國四年來抗建有極深刻之批評、認爲中國實係民主政治之主要擁護者、蓋以中國除須如其他國家自建新興獨立之民主政治外、尙須作殊死戰也、拉狄摩氏之聘任、據華盛頓各方面觀察、認爲中·美兩國間合作益臻圓滿之主要表現、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本等些什麼？</h3>
<p>德蘇開戰已歷一週，關係各國不問中立或非中立，差不多全已表明態度；單就軸心方面言之，連匈牙利，羅馬尼亞乃至斯洛伐克這些小國，都斷交的斷交，參戰的參戰，獨有首先和德義簽訂盟的的日本，反而徘徊瞻顧，始終還在開會討論，愼重靜觀之中，這眞是現代外交史的奇觀，無怪世人要問：日本究竟還等些什麼？</p>
<p>替今日的束京政府設想，委實已有左右爲難，不能當機立斷的苦處：宣佈中立，似乎太對不起同盟國，要待援引盟的罷，一方既違反了歷盡千辛萬苦纔得到手的日蘇友好條約，一方更等於正式加入德義戰綫，而在遠東方面獨力和中英美蘇四國對敵！這一窘境，雖是松岡多角外交的當然結果，但却決非今日的松岡所能解鈴繫鈴，挽救過來，在這種「左支右絀」的尷尬情形之下，自然祇有暫守緘默。這種緘默，縱然美其名日沉機觀變，但究其實際，一則昭示日本內部正鬧着親德派和非親德派的白熱爭辯，再則暴露近衛政府還需要觀望今後歐洲戰局的演變，纔能判斷究竟加入那一方面最爲便宜。日本這種患得患失的情景，固然是因爲對華用兵四年，實力消耗過半，不得不愼重將事的結果，但另外還有一個重大因素，爲近衛輩所必須顧到的，那就是日本今後爲自身利益着想，究竟是吾以促使歐亞兩組戰事正式合流爲得計？</p>
<p>自從前年歐戰爆發時起，直至上週德國攻蘇之前爲止，今世各大國中惟有蘇聯是「騎牆」派，她對於歐亞兩組戰事，顯然執行完全不同甚至互相矛盾的政策：在歐洲她和德國接近，似致間接助長了侵略的凶燄，在遠東她却直接援助反侵略的中國，以打擊日本；這在蘇聯本身，當然是一種矛盾，就世界大局而言，也正是一個瘤一個阻得民治陣綫確切成立的重大障碍。歐亞兩組戰事本來早可合流的，但因爲受蘇聯這種雙重外交的影響，竟使兩年來的國際時局始終未能澈底明朗。如今蘇聯已和中英兩國處於同一戰綫，假定日本「表明態度」的結果，乃是決計援引三國盟的，協助軸心作戰，則不論南進也罷，北進也罷，甚至西進也罷，目前的歐亞戰事便會立刻合流而成一整個的世界大戰；因爲屆時日本既正式協助軸心，英蘇兩國當然再無對日維持中立的理由，這樣一來，一面是中英蘇三國領導着歐洲各戰敗國，而由美國及其他各民治國爲其後盾，另一面則爲德義日三國領導着歐洲各小國，彼此割然，形成絕對鮮明的兩大陣營。在這一分野之中，民治國的陣容顯比侵略國「堅實」得多，如果沒有新的因素，料想日本還未必肯立即「自投羅綱」；它今日之所以還要觀望，還要顧慮的，大概就是爲了這個原因。質言之，日本至少須等待德蘇戰事分了高下，使它確信蘇聯已不足懼，更使它確信民治陣綫的實力已相形見絀，然後它纔敢於表明態度，在此以前，即使有所表示，恐怕也不得不出以極度保留極度含混的姿態。但是，萬一德國攻蘇異常得手，希特勒果眞在短時期內，打敗了蘇聯，則日本必定又耍認爲這是它的黃金機會到了，恐怕不待希特勒的催促，便會自告奮勇，履行盟約的。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見德蘇戰事的未來結果，不但足以決定日本今後的立塲，且可以左右整個大局的趨歸，因爲東西兩組戰事的是吾正式合流，亦將決於此戰之勝負誰屬？</p>

<h3>烏克蘭的現狀與沿革</h3>
<p>以黑土帶和「歐洲穀倉」者名的烏克蘭共和邦，是蘇聯歐洲之部的三大部分之一。它的</p>
<p>（疆域）北鄰白俄羅斯共和邦，東及東北界俄羅斯本部，西界波蘭—九三九年與德國分肥奪得波蘭東部，就是維斯杜拉河支流布格Bug河和桑San河以東的地方。—西南以聶斯德河與羅馬尼亞爲鄰，南濱黑海，著名的克里米亞半島伸入焉。它的</p>
<p>（面積）是四十四萬三千方公里，為歐洲大平原的，一大部分，平均高度在海拔一百公尺上下，沒有大山，只有蜿蜒起伏的小邱陵，可是沒有超過海拔一百五十公尺的。</p>
<p>（大河）有四條：最西聶斯德河，以决往東有布格河，有最著名的丹尼伯河恰巧把烏克蘭分爲兩大部分，最東有丹內資河，係頓河的支流。河流都是由西北奔向東南，祇有丹尼伯河多轉一個灣，從半路又轉向西南進入黑海。</p>
<p>（人民）烏克蘭的人口有三千一百九十萬，是蘇聯人烟最稠密的部分：因爲它的平均密度是每方公里七十人，而餘外的地方却只每方公里三十五人。民族是屬於斯拉夫漲的小俄羅斯族。所謂小俄羅斯族，是蘇聯南部草原民族的統稱，對於北方森林地帶的大俄羅斯人而言。可是實在說起來，他們的身體並不是低矮渺小如同憔僥國人一樣，而且反比那北方的大俄羅斯人爲高大。他們同大俄羅斯人的分別，就是頭顱骨更爲寬大，面色較褐，頭髮的顏色亦較爲深重而已。他們的性情也比較更爲快樂活潑，富於想像力和藝術性，而且眞情容易外露。</p>
<p>（富源）論到烏克蘭的富源，怪不得納粹德國要乖涎三尺，因爲它是農產最豐富和工業最發達的一塊地方。它那一望無垠上面罩着一層肥沃「黑土」的每一原田，一到春天，便碧草如茵點綴着五光十色的鮮艷野花；隨後麥浪起伏，遠連天際，更間着那甜菜和馬鈴薯田：眞是名實相副的一座養活人的「穀倉」呀！近來更在南部黑海附近試着栽種棉花，成績也是很好。礦產也非常豐富，特別是丹尼伯河下游鐵的蘊藏量多到二百一十萬萬噸，是世界鐵礦最豐富的地方之一。至於它的工業，旁的不用提，但一想到那聶伯羅彼得羅夫斯克（Dniepropetervosk）城附近（在丹尼伯河中段轉灣處）最近建築成功的大列寗發電廠，裝置有大發電機九架，總發電量達八十一萬匹馬力，能供給周圍二百公里地方的工廠用電，那你就可以知道它的工業是怎樣的一日千里了！在那裹有鋼鐵工廠，電氣工廠，化學工廠，機械工廠，…總而言之，應有盡有，原是兩个五年計劃的成績啊！</p>
<p>名城名城有卡科夫，位據丹內資河上游，人口八十三萬三千，爲鳥克蘭共和邦的首府。工業發達，也是由莫斯科通黑海的鐵道中樞。基輔在丹尼伯河右岸，人口八十五萬，爲老基輔國的國都，在宗敎文藝上夙享盛名，也是農產地帶的中心。奧迪薩人口六十萬，在黑海北岸，港灣深邃，設備周至，爲蘇聯南方的門戶，並以輸出黑土地帶的小麥著名。</p>
<p>略史烏克蘭地方，初爲東西哥德人的祖國；自從他們受匈奴人的壓迫西遷後，斯拉夫人纔佔據了這塊肥土。這種民族最古的歷史，我們所知道的極少；大概在公元五六世紀時，有一個盎茲Autes王國成立；不過在七世紀時已受外族的入侵而滅亡了。公元八六二年，有從斯堪的那維亞半島的北蠻酋長路列克（Ruri來k)，定居在現在的諾夫哥羅（Novogorod）地方，建設國家，是爲現在俄國的起源。他有一個名叫奧萊格Oleg的兄弟，却佔據了基輔，建爲國家，是爲現在烏克蘭的肇始。</p>
<p>公元十世紀時，某輔國勢大張，有名佛萊提茂Vladimir（980－1015）的一個君主，纔改奉了基督敎。他的兒子法老斯拉夫Taroslav在位時，國土國力更形增進，儼如日行中天。他也同西歐各國信使往來，並且有一位公主遠嫁給法國的國王亨利第一。</p>
<p>不過在草原上建設的國家，沒有天然的屏障，當然容易受外國的侵凌。果然在十二世紀時，基輔爲北方俄國的一位親王所奪據，十三世紀時又變成蒙古人附屬物。公元一三四〇年歸於波蘭，烏克蘭之名亦自此始。及至十七世紀初，羅曼諾夫族當了俄國的皇帝，遂和波蘭展開了爭奪基輔的連年血戰，儼如我國春秋時晋楚兩國拚死力爭奪鄭國一樣。緊接着土耳其也加入了，於是烏克蘭活活的被割裂成三部分：西邊是波蘭的烏克蘭，東邊是俄羅斯的烏克蘭，南邊却又是土耳其的烏克蘭。</p>
<p>這時出了一位名叫馬紫帕（Mazeppa）的愛國英雄，努力作統一烏克蘭的運動，也就是英國詩人拜倫和法國詩人囂俄所歌詠贊歏的那位文學中心的浪漫英雄。他於公元一六八七年變成冒險民族哈薩克一意爲「化外之民」－人的領袖，遂和俄羅斯人連絡以擺脫波蘭人的羈絆。他有二十年的工夫在他那拔都梅Batoueime城過着一種豪華而充滿文學意味的君主生活，眞可稱得起是一種基輔的文藝復興時期。有多少文學著作相樅產生，而且是充滿了西方色彩的拉丁化的人文學派。及至俄國彼得大帝眞欲收烏克蘭爲己有時，馬紫伯便轉身北向，和那時正同彼得大帝爭雄的瑞典名王查理十二合作。查理十二也正式承認烏克蘭爲獨立國，而且孤軍深入的，就爲助他一臂之力哩。不幸公元一七〇九年在那著名的波爾塔伐Poltava戰役，查理十二全軍覆沒，馬紫帕也就隨着流亡至土耳其國落魄以終了。東部烏克蘭又遂墮入俄國的掌握。</p>
<p>十九世紀後半期，烏克蘭的民族意識又復活了：它最初採取了文學方式，出產了些民間歌謠史詩等，完全是充滿了愛國氣息的。可是聖彼得堡政府當然要盡力壓迫，絕不承認他們的要求爲正當的了。</p>
<p>（現狀）第一次歐戰爆發　，俄國在一九一七年也發生社會革命。烏克蘭趁機於十二月問宣布獨立，召集國會。一九一八年俄德議和條約中，有一條款是承認它的獨立的。可是隨後它變成俄國白俄抵抗赤俄的大本營：白俄終歸失敗，鳥克蘭又重入莫斯科政府統治之下。公元一九二二年，蘇俄聯邦制成立，烏克蘭乃得爲聯邦之一而加入莫斯利的集團政制。不過烏克蘭自有它的特殊言語的，現在在全烏克蘭的學校，軍隊，與一切政治機關中已竟是完全採用了烏克蘭語爲通用的語言。還有一件是外人不大明瞭的事：就是蘇俄儘管打倒宗敎，提倡無神論，而烏克蘭人却充滿了宗敎復活的精神；他們不但要復興東正敎，而且大有同老羅馬敎皇言歸於好，以歸復到老天主敎的希望呢。現在它又遇到一種嚴重的危險階段了，誰知道將來的命運怎樣？參考書法國百科全書，普通地理，Larrousse圖書雜誌一九三四年十月份。</p>

<h3>紗花　棉紗市塲漲風更盛　竟叩千六百元關　下午暗盤已破一千六百元　如無弭平辦法大變在目前　本報答復一投函人之質問</h3>
<p>紗市續升、且漲風漸熾、此因港幫銷路繼續不懈、今日又有一千七百五十五件運去、加之有一部份二十支紗缺貨、且購買不便利、所以該幫改辦雙馬較爲爽快、因之雙馬廠單交易接聯而不斷、同時原料價格日見提高、種種因素、足使紗市之鞏固、但拋空之額甚鉅、賣方鑒於以上情况、勢難抵抗、而雙馬廠單有逐步减縮在二萬包內、二則南方需要不衰、巳穿過五月三日之一千五百八十五元之價、空方處此環境之下、陣綫不固、祇得忍痛扒補、市盤乃急轉直上、市塲傳言紛紜、謂某大戶因倒閉一家、空頭額子約有四千包以外、自己亦在同等地位、不過其的幸運較佳、半年以來、的在空頭上賺錢、所以血力頗强、後檯撐足、然視此狀態、亦抱識時務爲俊傑主義、乘機由空翻多、收進數量有六七千包之鉅、午後因週末例行停市、然有人說、證券大樓中非正式已做過一千六百二十元、照此情形、空頭發生惶恐、總之最近以美印棉一致昂騰、原料上漲、實爲空頭之大害、紗市前途、乃起變化、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因聞某紗號在深夜倒閉、籌碼空出約有四千包、於是浮空紛來扒補、首盤爲一千五百七十五元、直上至一千五百八十七元、已穿出上月三日之一千五百八十五元之頂高價、繼聞現紗廣幫胃口仍健、人心更挺、漲至一千五百九十四兀、然有一部份復來拋空、回鬆至一千五百七十七元、迄至十二時以後、某大空頭翻進額子殊巨、又昂至一千五百八十五元收盤、查半日間成交統計一萬四千二百包、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列列左、</p>
<p>金雙馬標紗市况、趨勢巳向上、交易興旺、空頭抵補、結果七月期漲五元、八月期漲三元半、查成交八千包、茲將其半日間高低及收盤價如左、</p>
<p>咋有投函本報列舉本月十二日至本月二十六日止本報棉紗新聞、謂爲「或爲多頭說法、或爲空頭鼓吹、翻雲覆雨、極盡其播弄能事、誠不知新聞道德之爲何物、良堪浩嘆」云云、該函又謂本報「僞造消息、如昨日（二十六日）報曰、在此一旬中、本報所戴棉紗運往香港之數、約有一萬包以外、試查六月十六日以至二十七日之貴報市價表、各日所載現紗成交數、屬於香港幫者、共計不過三千五百十件、屬於同行投機交易者、則達二萬四千六百三十件之多、又不知新聞價値何在、値此物價飛漲、民不堪命之日、奈何再作此火上澆油之計、諒亦非先生所樂爲、」以上所云、該來函人主要辭旨、大致已盡於是、雖未要求在報上答復、但本報立塲公正、從不畏人言、是是非非、自有其立塲、故願揭而出之、俾讀者公鑒、</p>
<p>編者茲答復該投函人、既知「新聞貴乎報道客觀、不宜作主觀宣傳、」更不應貿然以此相責、蓋正爲市面有上漲之趨勢、則以爲將高、非「爲多頭說伕、」市面有回落之朕兆、則以爲將低、非「爲空頭鼓吹」、完全從「客觀」作「報導」、未嘗從「主觀」作「宣傳、」只有做紗花投機之輩、買進則日冀其漲、賣出則巴望其落、纔有主觀之成見、一有成見、即任何公正報道、大勢觀察、所見無往而不非、合乎我意者謂之是、逆我意者謂之吾、是非既不明、則其所見之合理與吾、不値一顧、</p>
<p>至謂運往香港之棉紗、約有一萬包以外、及據市價表所載香港幫現紗成交數不過三千五百餘件、而以爲「又不知新開價値何在、」是眞盲且胡鬧、編者不必自責、而責該投函人平時讀報太鹵莽、下筆太忽忙、要知此一句左右、據本報實地調查、運往香港等地之棉紗、確有萬包左右、至其內容如何、無須宣布、只要該投函人平心靜氣以求之、不難立得、若事實未明瞭、而以詬駡爲能、即使火氣太大、亦不應向本報發作、善養其氣、則幸甚矣、</p>
<h3>棉市愈昂</h3>
<p>現棉情況堅挺萬狀、一般執貨者皆不願出樣、大家當嘗作國寳看待矣、蓋雙馬現紗突飛猛晋、及廠家納胃不襄、加之海外棉市日日飛騰、申地價、較爲廉宜、所以棉商目的不達、却不肯輕易放髻、粗細原棉復漲三五元、做開售盤列左、共一千五百十四件價漲三五元</p>
<p>紐約棉市因有投機同業、及華爾街買進而漲、同時更因議院堅決反對棉布最高限價而活躍猛挺、咋日收盤價格較之上日叉漲二十七八磅因</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因投機者買進而漲、旋因歐州出口商售出略跌、最後又因空頭抵補活躍再漲、結果收盤價格、各漲一至六羅比不等、叉預測今日開盤市况看高三至四羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉洋行定貨交易、因美印棉再漲、及現紗情形良好、而市况堅昂、各方購意均頗興奮、昨日中外商紗廠皆購進巴西棉千包以上、同時花號家亦有印棉成交也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉紗銳漲　棉布現貨昂勝</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市繼德趨漲、乃因投機品紗布漲勢銳厲、引起囤藏心思、期貨需要亦見濃厚、白貨粗細布斜紋每疋漲二角半至五角、漂染布每疋亦再升五角左右、本街成交獨旺、綜計五百餘件、內期貨斜紋絨法絨條子絨布占半數、客幫粵廣幫辦藍布卡其斜紋等一百餘件、暹暹新加坡等地辦漂染各布五千餘疋、今日有疋頭五百五十件、運往香港、</p>
<p>東布　昨以雙馬紗價暴騰、業內外人心益昂、進胃續旺、取引所期貨因交割無市、現貨市塲週六做半天而漲風殊烈、龍頭細布棧單高峯售四十九元四角、道午收盤梢回爲四十九元〇五分、其他中下檔細布均各提升五角至七角半、色貨四君子嗶嘰晨開一度升至一元六角二分、收槃爲一元六角一分半、現貨銀行棧單做開一元五角八分二厘半、蓋聞下月起將增加統稅、現貨客需允爲俏俐、</p>
<h3>金融　日商出售　外匯轉鬆</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌各匯未更、英美匯暗市轉趨回鬆、乃美匯五元三七五中外商行均肯售出、進口商售進仍微、及悉金價轉漲回跌、且恐蘇日衝突、及福克斯主張提高美金至五元半傳說、日商銀行供售、投機家又來拋塞、兼售八月期新交易五元四三七五、市勢趨鬆、至收市、英匯亦見帶硬、下午週六無市、半日交易頗旺、</p>
<p>八月期已做開</p>
<p>自晨外電銀市英美印一致未更、各國匯兌英對滬獨縮零三一二五、餘平、中央掛牌各匯未動、內盤早開銀行賣便、現貨英匯三辦士二九六八七五、美金五元三七五、進口洋行來扒進六月英金五先三七五、進口商亦有同月同價捕進、匯豐掛牌均平、白銀平衡稅仍微百分之二三·七五後、市勢仍趨穩頗久、十點半後、日商銀行又來塞出七月美金五元四零六二五、投機家同價亦來吐售、及聞利空消息、華商再售予有利八月五元四三七五、故至午收、現貨至七月期均英匯三辦士三一二五、美金五元四零六二五、比前日收市、英長零一五六二五、美長零三一二五云、</p>
<p>津市英匯稍緊</p>
<p>天津二十八日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、倫敦電匯緊零三一二五、爲三便士七一八七五、紐約電匯及中匯俱無變化、「聯鈔」暗盤昂二角半、爲六十五元、</p>
<p>港申匯市獨升</p>
<p>香港二十八日（週六）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、申匯現貨獨升一元七角半、爲四百五十三元六角半、餘無變動、下午週六無市、</p>
<h3>美匯有提長可能　金市反動回跌</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗盤、微漲後突反動轉跌、價一度潰退至六千四百元大關內、各方人心受該風刺激而轉趨於疲、乃平準金美人福克斯主張、將本埠美匯提長至五元半、更謠蘇日恐有戰事發生、故外匯轉硬、加以銀號及金號幫之吐售、當於午刻由六千四百三十五元、銳退至六千三百八十五元、證券幫之不斷力進、抬出六千四百元外、尙軋小十七元、半日交易共二萬餘兩、下午週六無市、掉期（六月轉入七月）賣方永安貼出予祥興永三十兩、價六十元、回低十元、現金亦降、祥和在期交六千四百三十元左右時、售予成記五十兩、價高三百元、後期交回跌、故高三百二十元有買戶、軋降十數元、飾金關金等仍平、</p>
<p>期貨欲漲反跌</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）九點十五分開市爲六千四百二十五元、計高四元、仁承永售小至六千四百二十三元、益大·熾大·成記·來力進、在六千四百三十元逗留甚久、一度抬至六千四百三十五元、後僅數元起落、直至十點三刻始露疲態、外匯報鬆、利空謠風亦起、傷內恒記·合盛·德大·鼎盛·仁承永等先後力售、浮多傾斬、價遂步降四十餘元、跌入六千四百元內、見六千三百八十五元、證券號益大·德孚再起收吸、恒記亦來復進、當又回起二十元、達六千四百零五元、正午收市六千四百零四元、比上日跌十七元、照七月美金五元四〇六二五結價、爲六千四百四十二元、計撳三十八元、收後平、當日有五十元差度、下午無市、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高三百三十元、牧進比售出低七十元、現標金無價無市、</p>
<p>飾金呆立不更</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行均仍掛六百九十五元、收進减四十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣亦稍降落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價漲後轉跌、且現貨亦同時趨軟、故英美金鎊亦降一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票開盤四角二分、開後會高至八角半、嗣忽退至三角半、卒以十八元三角七分收盤、比上日軋跌五分、現貨仍須减低二角七八分、香港票趨勢穩定、日金票略趨軟化、晚市退爲一元八角五分半、朝鮮票趨勢穗定、市價站平、晚市爲一元五角七分、</p>
<h3>承兌業務停辦</h3>
<p>本市銀行業聯合準備委員會銀行票據承兌所、自民國二十五年三月問成立以來、辦理同業間票據承兌東宜、調劑令融、業務尙稱發達、上年本市銀根鬆弛、承兌業務隨之减少、最近游資充塞、承兌事宜、已無形停頓、該所爲撙節開支起見、決定暫行停辦承兌業務、咋通函各所員銀行廢止承兌契的、所有所員銀行前繳該所之承兌基金、準本月底前返還云、</p>
<h3>糧食　港米有鉅額待沽　投機已難活動市面漸形平穩　港米昨日連到兩批數不在少</h3>
<p>洋洋市况、依然升降不一、形成盤旋之象、早市客囤兩淡、浮多獲利了結、內地幫前辦未會裝出、新交觀望不前、而存底與到量既多、公賣港米亦有鉅額待沽、因是開價立即下遊、期現各米一度跌落元外至二元、繼因價小引起寗波幫之添辦、先後辦去期路現貨不下五千包、本街散戶亦趁平吸收、市乃疲而復站、惟全日間市面尙稱平正、一般掀風作浪之徒無法爲搶帽子與踢皮球之工作、總計現貨成交祇七千多包、英華司原包亦祇五六百噸、結果行情終見盤小一元左右、英華司碎米現路兩貨均乏做開、七月份自一百十五元至一百十四元、二號　米前開一百四十一二元者、昨祇一百四十元〇五角及一百四十元、小絞現路均一百四十九元至一百四十八元半、一號西貢亦未做開、現貨售價均小元外、收市形居定勢、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米、昨呈供求相仿之局、各價悉守原盤、未有榮辱、繪開南港新鮮早晚稻百三十七元至百三十四元、中關原包百三十五元、無錫原包宿粳百三十一元至百三十元</p>
<p>糯米去路轉淸、交易殊見寥落、香　白元雖市貨有限、售價卒難支持、見降近元、開香港高白元百廿二元半、百廿二元、中决百十七八元、糯菉百十二元半决至百零六元、國糯則自價格貶透後、頗有零胃問津、而貨主亦不願再事輕脫、所以行情又無軒輊、普通貨繼開百二十元左右、不過高貨尙須百二十三四元云、</p>
<p>大批洋米、以太古公司安順輪昨午抵埠、由香港裝洋米二萬八千七百九十二包、其中一萬二千三百十四包、係工部局平價米、餘均客貨、該輪停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭、昨晚連夜開始起卸、該公司太原輪亦巳於昨日傍晚到滬、亦有洋米裝來、確數須星期一探明續報、（祖）</p>
<h3>洋粉到貨不絕</h3>
<p>現洋粉市况、經前日一度微升後、又趨盤旋不定之象、蓋緣邇日香港轉來、到貨踵接、前兩日本報所載漢陽船新到鐘樓花烏牌等粉二萬三百餘包、正在起卸、聞下週初尙有太原輪裝到三萬七千包、際此到貨不絕聲中、囤戶袖手、惟今後定貨終屬不劃、且平賣粉即將停止、故人心尙難看小、市面在平靜中做開金龍粉三十二元二角半至二角、及雙鷹粉三十二元零五分、砲台粉及鍊樓粉喊價三十三元、均無受主、市面尙在醖釀中、</p>
<h3>油餅　油餅實銷均懈</h3>
<p>食油實銷又轉懈淡、人心復形萎軟、昨由散囤售出靑島生油三十桶、價爲一百七十五元、七月上交大有廠淸油近千担、價一百二十元至一百十九元、比前見降元許、</p>
<p>苞米昨市一昂即平、始因杭州幫續有採辦而見喊升半元有奇、嗣以囤戶道高羣相出籠回低、結果前相彷、計售開西貢及嗬囒苞米共二千多包、（價詳市價　）</p>
<p>豆餅走銷尙鮮起色、咋市多方扳持未果、又轉下游、卒比前軋低二三角、計售開甡記豆餅四萬片、（價詳市價欄）</p>
<p>今日有豆子三百五十包、豆餅一萬二千五百塊、生仁三百包、均運香港、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債多頭　獲利出籠</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市一漲即跌、一方因新夡拉抬無力、一方因老多漸漸出籠、北幫連日皆有出脫、市塲一般人咸謂多方出籠、乃係救濟空頭、以便抵補、吾則將無機會可補、此種說辭、完全爲多頭章本、一種色厲內荏之狀、無形顯露、按做交易者基本存心、均想獲利、昨日市况之轉疲、爲多頭過於擁擠、投資者百不得一、於是稍有搖動、咸欲覓途逃避、誠恐大批出籠、叉爲空方所乘、乃造此巧言、以誘致空方之抵補、多方乃得脫手獲利、且現在大部份均係現貨進出、偶有借貨交出者、爲數究居少數、故目卞之趨勢帶疲、完全多方出籠、初與傳言絕無關係也、如昨日行市、初由怡泰抬價、丙種開三元四角、同康即有賣出、鴻大亦有出籠、三元頓形打破、新康信昌再來買進、北幫穗昌及仁豐又有出籠、故市况一高即低、多方雖欲竭力提抬、無奈陣綾之不一致、故結果仍疲落一角至三角、成交約一百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>滙通洋行經理之英商薛納王橡皮有限公司、定於七月十一日召開第二十一决股東大會、該公司截至一九四一年一月底一年度之純益的爲國幣七十餘萬元、本屆末决股息、每股擬派國幣一角五分、全年共派息國幣二角五分、</p>

<p>英商中和產業有限公司、定七月十六日開派一九四一年份特別中期股息、每股國幣三元、此項股息、係由售產盈餘提撥云、</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖稍見回好</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢、因囤戶乘低吸收、行家扳售、致回好五角、公會劃盤、二四粗白現貨外棧三月份到八十八元、四月份到八十八元三角、五月份八十九元三角至八十九元、六月份到九十元零四角、指明六月二十三日到貨九十元零五角、荷赤NT嘜六十八元五角、太古車白B嘜一百零六元四角、轉口貨八十九元一角、HX嘜東棧八十八元、H嘜車赤六十七元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲遭嚴重統制</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、較前日互有漲跌、本埠絲市日來遭受更嚴重之統制、一切交易巳吿停頓、因檢騐局現巳停止檢騐各項生絲、（即不給出口證）、唯華中公司例外、照此情形、滬埠所有生絲、皆不能出口矣、而各洋莊絲行、此後亦不至再購買無出口證之生絲、故絲業際此、已達絕途、</p>
<h3>煤炭　烟煤銷塲滯澀</h3>
<p>烟煤生意、近日來平靜無大生色、蓋以價格提高後、售方心思雖堅、奈銷塲呆澀、去路不振、亦屬極然、市情又呈徘徊之象、昨開印度烟煤、同業行拆、棧房貨四百二十八元、行槓外加、聞　日成交袛五百餘噸云、</p>
<h3>藥材　藥芡續升</h3>
<p>藥芡近以到貨無繼、市上本客手貨均甚稀缺、故市勢續見上展、如白皮芡叉升二十元、售至二百二十元、紅皮芡較平、售一百六七十元、</p>
<h3>呢絨　呢絨夏銷不弱</h3>
<p>呢絨類　來銷路不弱、　墊者均多秋冬貨、原箱交易爲夥、實銷用戶所需耍者、均多派力司萬而頂·羽紗呢胖別取·削克司頂立維呢·白嗶嘰白直貢·眞假蔴膠布·白帆布黃斜紋等等、交易雖多零碎、而經當者頗不弱、買力顧客、對於西裝製做、較往年未逢閏六月時爲夥、</p>
<h3>友生防雨布織　造參觀記</h3>
<p>— 周志峰</p>
<p>防雨布乃近年來所新發明，裁製雨衣，允爲合格，蓋其質輕與抱別林相彷，價又遠較舶來品爲廉。今庚以來，銷路吏普及，遠及南洋各埠，非常繁盛。經營者則有「上海雨布雨衣廠」和「中國內衣公司」及「友生染織廠」三家。惟中國內衣公司與上海雨布雨衣廠，俱不售料，製成雨衣，門莊出賣，友生廠則大量生產，專做　批現定貨而不零沽，今市上所流通，本客幫所買賣，均係友生金態牌貨。鄙人業呢絨，與本客幫相往返，爲保持自身信譽計，所經售之毛棉各貨，其質地之優劣，未嘗不三致意，因之亦欲知防雨布之內容，而有參觀友生廠之意，日前驅車往滬西極司非而路三十一號（發行所在雲南路二百八十八號）該廠參觀，承陳經理繼　招待指示，知有機一百二三十部，三分之二專織防雨布，三分之一織製其他布疋。防雨布之紡織，其經緯全用國產上等燒毛綫，配以特殊組織製織之。原料進廠，先加以拉力試騐和條梗檢查，再交入準備間，經過絡經整經及捲緯二項之準備工程後，方可上機織製。因防雨布質地之堅，磅份之重，非普通布機所能勝任，故該廠辦有特製重磅機件專門織製（未完</p>

<h3>德在滬購貯貨物　傳卽將貶價出售　價値美金一百萬元以上　本市經濟將起有利影響</h3>
<p>此間人士預料、德蘇之問、旣起戰事、上海德方出口商購貯之大量食物及許多物品、未能照預定辦法、循橫貫西伯利亞鐵路運德、乃不得不設法脫手、故其價格、不久即將大跌、</p>
<p>迫切需要　原料食物</p>
<p>本埠商　界聲稱、蘇德戰事爆發前、德方會託日商及其他中立商號、在東方大事採辦、德國因繼續作戰、對原料與食物之需要、益形迫切、故德商人皆儘可能範圍、竭力在上海或日本獲取物料、俾經海參崴由橫貫西伯利亞鐵路運德、</p>
<p>存滬貨物　數量極鉅</p>
<p>可靠方面傳德方所購貨物、計有椰子油·錫·銅·米·麵粉·硝酸鹽·及鵭等物、貯積上海、無法運出、關於食物方面、德國已託日商採辦大量爪哇糖、現存本市各倉庫、德商界雖多公開誇言、所貯大量貨物、不致因未能運德而跌價者、然各方人士咸以爲德人在滬所貯各種物料之價格、將於數週內劇跌、　最後必須　減價脫手</p>
<p>傳上海糖價近　告低落者、多因德人貯糖甚巨、現已開始考慮减價脫手所致、消息靈通人士謂蘇德戰事若曠日持久、則德商界將改變其目前之樂觀、而決計儘量出售存貨、則其價勢必减低、此於本市經濟、將起有利之影響、蓋德商「傾銷」貨物之價格旣减低、其他各貨售價或將隨之趨跌也、</p>
<p>經手代辦　獲利甚豐</p>
<p>上海德方出口商運貨赴德之唯一安全路綫西伯利亞鐵路、既已遮斷、德商貿易與穗國國內經濟、俱受重大打擊、德方在此所購貨物、爲數頗巨、且德商亟欲採辦其所需之物品、不惜償付遠較市價爲高之價格、故本埠中日及中立出口商代穗方採辦貨物、獲利頗豐、若干人士估計目下德方擱貯在滬之貨物、共値美金百萬元以上、亦有估計遠較此數爲巨者、確數尙未可得、</p>
<p>德貨缺乏　市價續漲</p>
<p>蘇德戰事之另一反響、厥爲德商號深知德國出品已不復能運抵遠東市塲、故抬高德貨如藥品·顏料·染料·機件·與科學儀器等之零躉售價、過去數載來、德貨在中國各埠與內地、銷售頗廣、前數月內、因航行遠東之船隻缺少、中國難獲美國機械、故向德國採購大批機件今則情勢改觀、此後數日、上海德貨市價、必將續漲至新高價、</p>
<h3>德義在荷印婦孺　全部撤退赴日　乘淺間丸於下月九日過滬　德義成年男子遭荷印拘禁</h3>

<p>抵滬以後　均將登岸</p>
<p>淺間丸抵滬時、德義婦孺多將登岸、唯有親友在日本者、始將續赴神戶、此輩婦孺之旅費、是否自行償付、抑由德政府付給、未能探悉、而日郵會社方面亦未知彼等所乘艙位、究屬何等、據該會某員稱、上海方面可否購票搭淺間丸赴神戶尙未確悉、正候通知中、若能購票、則搭淺間丸抵滬之旅客、將改乘龍田丸去日云、按淺間丸原照定期航程七月五日過滬駛美、旋突宣布從馬尼刺空船駛往巴達維亞、載送該處德義婦孺、</p>

<h3>假期中應做的幾件工作</h3>
<p>— 宛</p>
<p>小朋友們看見了這題目，一定覺得很奇怪，爲什麼放了暑假，還要我們工作呢？那麽學校爲什麽要放暑假，爲的是要給我們休息啊？是的，學學校放暑假，的確是要學生們的身體休息一下，可是小朋友別弄錯了，假期的意思，並不是要小朋友終日只吃飯不做事的做個懶惰蟲，也不希望你們終日閒蕩的做個糊塗蟲。它的本意，是耍調節嚴肅的學校生活，使在活動的自由的家庭生活下，在身體上知識上仍得到合理的進步。</p>
<p>我已說過家庭生活是自由的，活動的，瑣屑的，沒有敎師敎導，只有家長的督促，因着父母子女間的感情，所以沒有敎師的認眞。假期中成續的優劣，要看每個小朋友自動作業的程度如何。從以往幾個假期中，觀察小朋的生活；有的縱情遊玩，身體瘦了，甚至開學的起初幾個星期，沒有心緒讀書。有的小朋什，在活動生活下，仍規律的工作着，他們有時讀書，有時勞動，把一天的時間支配得很好，假期末了，他們成績畢竟不差，在工作，他們的身體和知識顯著的進步了。</p>
<p>小朋友們？我們知道了工作可使我們的身體强健，知識長進，也可得到極大的快樂和豐富的經騐，而且工作後的休息，才是最需要的，最舒適的，工作的範圍很廣，種類很多，現在將適於假期中的工作，列舉於後，希望小朋友們？隨心所欲，加以活用。</p>
<p>一，多看書報：關於書籍方面，選　有益的兒童讀物，屏絕一切塲風敗俗的連環圖晝，看的時候，除掉明瞭內客外，還要研究的結構，注意好的句子和難的字句，至於報紙是精神糧食，每天不可不看，况且國際風雪變幻莫測的時代，我們更不可以不看，使我們眼光擴大。</p>
<p>二，家屋掃除，當此夏令的時候，務求家屋整潔避免疾病傳染，小朋們要促進家人注意，幫助刷掃，或一星期大掃除一决，一方面養成勞動習慣，一方面可减少疾病。</p>
<p>三，敎人識字：在家裹人或鄰居中，他們喜歡讀書而沒有機會的，那麼你可利用這悠長的假期，敎他們識字，或講有意義的故事，使他們的品德絕長，解釋他們不識字的痛苦。</p>
<p>四，小組會議：聚集幾個志同道合的同學或姊妹兄弟，每星期開會一次，或討論一切難題，或相的出遊，或硏沒時事問題，或有正當的娛樂，藉此連絡感情，又可得到多許知識。</p>
<p>五，藝書重溫：對於讀過的書籍，隨時溫習，以免遺忘，不負我們當時準備的苦心。</p>
<p>以上幾點，是我大概的意見，小朋友如有更有價値的工作，儘可去實行。總之，每一個小朋友，不要使寳貴的假期在懶惰閒散中過去才是，最後希望小朋友的身體知識在假期中兼顧並進。</p>
<h3>黃梅天</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>一連下了一日一夜的雨，低窪的馬路上頓時的積起水來，就是阿慧家住的那一條里弄，不免也浸沒在泥漿水中，變成了一條小河，一慕異樣的水景，映在阿慧的眼裏，覺得異樣的有趣，幸而他學校裏自前天起放了暑假，對於這一次的積水毫不受到影響，然而他的父親爲了辦事，便被人力車夫大「敲竹槓」，僅僅擺一擺道一段望得見的路，竟討價四五角錢，還一錢價也不行，這種生意大可做得，要是被那輩囤積奸商聽得了，也着實要眼紅哩。</p>
<p>這樣大量的雨下着，而氣溫並不低下，這樣便形成了黃梅天，阿慧覺得很是悶熱，混身的不舒服，宛然是在薰蒸着</p>
<p>「黃梅天的日光很是强烈，空氣潮濕，氣候炎熱，道種炎熱而潮濕的空氣，可以使我們的皮膚溫度增高，同時使血液的循環變慢，但血液循環變慢時，便不能得到一些充分的養氣，可以供給腦部和身體其他各部，因此我們便感覺到很不舒適。這種現象恰巧和春天溫暖的時節相反我們因此都喜歡春天而討厭這種黃梅天氣。耍知道黃梅天不是全市界都有的，而是我國和日本所特有的天氣，大概在梅子黃熟的時候開始，就是在陰歷五月中旬，可是今年的黃梅是比較遲了一些，故又叫它「晚黃梅」，黃梅天的有一個月的光景，天氣很是悶鬱。那麼爲什麼會發生的呢？一到了國歷六月：太陽直射到我國的長江流域一帶，便發生了低氣壓，但不停止在一個地方，而是慢慢的向東推進，如果一發生低氣壓，便要下雨。當低氣壓正向東進行時，那知道太平洋的北部高氣壓也很發達，一有了高氣壓便變成天晴，而高氣壓偏偏停止低氣壓的進路，可是低氣壓敵不過高氣壓，便縮了回來，只得停留在長江流域一帶，所以每天烏雲密布看不見日光，而氣溫很高，空氣潮濕，這便是黃梅天了。」阿明回答了這麼長的一大篇，心想他弟弟總不會再問下去了。</p>
<p>「哥哥，你瞧弄堂裹怎麽會積起水來了？」阿慧仍是問個不休，眞出了阿明意料之外</p>
<p>「這當然是弄堂的地形太低，因爲水是喜歡向低下的地方流去的。你想這樣大的雨，加上黃浦江裏有很大的潮水，雨水不能盡向黃浦江裹流去，而黃浦江裏的水反從陰溝裏流進來，於是水便向低的地方彙集起來。」阿明說到這裹，才把阿慧的問話打住了。」</p>
<h3>螢光燈的故事</h3>
<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>在鄉村中夏天的晚上可以看到流螢，它的尾部發着微微的亮光，小朋友們很喜歡捉它放在玻璃瓶裏玩，這是怪有趣的。</p>
<p>關於螢的來歷，古人有一種誤會的傳說，以爲是腐草所化生；如月令說：「腐草化爲螢。」爾雅也說：「腐草得暑濕之氣爲螢」，這當然是由於不懂生物學之故。</p>
<p>螢的身子雖小，但心地耿耿，生活於水邊草際而光明獨具，不被暗夜所同化，不以風雨而損明。在昏瞑的宇宙間，獨往獨來，自行其素，眞可以說是虫類的「出類拔萃」者了！</p>
<p>上海自電力公司因燃料來源缺乏，發表籲請市節减用電的辦伕後，如何節省電流？頗爲全滬人士所關懷，於是最近便有從美國不遠千里而來的「螢光燈」出現了。</p>
<p>說起「螢光燈」，我國古時曾有以螢籠代燈而照渡客的傳說。但是現在南京路一帶各大公司所製的「螢光燈」，係依據科學原理藉電力而發光，並無眞的螢火在內，不過形色有些像螢光罷了。惟有古時的「螢光燈」，那才名符其實呢？據晋書說：「那時有個車胤，年靑好學常日以繼夜而不輟，但因家貧，燈油每每無着，遂製了紗囊，盛入螢火代燈以照讀。」這是昔賢窮讀書的佳話，也正是節省燈油，發明「螢光燈」的起源。</p>
<h3>黎明前</h3>
<p>— 肖文</p>
<p>有一條特大的米蛀虫，性情很奇特，覺得終日在米缸中沒有趣味，想飛到天空中去玩玩，欣實同類所沒有眼福看到的東西，但因沒有翅膀，不能實現自己的理想，然而它的心却並不因此而死，却反而更熱烈。自己不能飛，於是只得去懇求野雞先生，請它幫助成就自己的美夢，雖然野雞先生本來是不願的，然而經不起它「三跪九叩首」的誠意，只能答應了。</p>
<p>野雞先生叫野雞夫人去拿一根蔴綾，同時可囑米蛀虫說：「你要用全付力量咬住這根繩，決不可放，並且決不可說一句話！，要記牢！」米蛀虫爲了要飽眼福，當然一一答應</p>
<p>於是野雞夫婦倆用嘴銜住蔴綫的兩端，敏捷地飛到高空中，跨過河流，飛過森林，越過山嶺，後來到了平原。它看到靑的水，紅的花，綠的草，灰的土…</p>
<p>有一個人看到這希奇的景象，高聲喊道：「快來看！快來看！一條米蛀虫和兩隻野雞同在天上飛！」「那裏？那裹？」大家驚奇地問。「諾，諾，喏！」他回答說。人們都放棄了自己的工作，來看這世界的奇觀－米蛀虫飛到天上去。「呀！這是一條多麼幸福的米蛀虫！」有人這樣讚嘆着。</p>
<p>米蛀虫看到有這許多人來看自己，非常高興，覺得有無上光榮。後來竟聽到有人稱它是一條幸福的米蛀虫，更快樂得忘記了自己是條沒有翅膀的寄生虫。</p>
<p>「哈哈！」它得意地笑着。「我究竟成了…」話還未說完，它的身子突然下降，跌在地上，成了糊爛的一團。</p>
<p>野雞夫婦倆也隨着飛下，攫去了它的屍體，留着明天作一頓美味的早餐。</p>
<p>黎明：雄雞喔喔地，野雞享權利，米蛀虫再也飛不起。聲明：上星期日「祝前程無量」一稿，爲楊春綠君所作，漏排署名，特此聲明。</p>
<h3>老鷹筆架</h3>
<p>— 張璜</p>
<p>小朋友！我來吿訴你做一隻極簡單的老鷹筆架吧。</p>
<p>你先看看這裹的圖，一塊是老鷹的身子，一塊是老鷹的翅膀，你先把兩部份在圖晝紙上放大，再塗上顏色。</p>
<p>第二部手續是糊到馬糞紙上，等乾燥後，剪下來。這時，你把　個凹榫挿接起來，老鷹架就成功了。這小是極容易的嗎？</p>
<p>要是材料不用馬糞紙，用薄竹片或鉛皮製成，外面再用彩色油漆繪起來，那就更加耐用，更加美麗了。</p>

<h3>曹禺的諷刺喜劇</h3>
<p>— 沙飛</p>
<p>上海劇藝社繼「正氣歌」後演出的是曹禺改編諷刺喜劇「鍍金」。此劇原名「迷眼的沙子」。</p>
<p>「鍍金」其二幕，故事很簡單：</p>
<p>「馬壽卿大夫有一個年方及　的女見叫馬美鵝，趙雲庭先生有一個業已成人的兒子喚趙文明，這二個年輕人天天在一起彈琴唱歌，偷倫地都愛上了，後來雙方的家長，經過一下談判，決定訂爲秦晋之好，然而爲了大家要顧全面子，不得不舖張塲面，爲了要支持這「鈹金」的塲面，就幾乎拆散了兒女的一段姻緣。」</p>
<p>曹禺的劇本，如電雨，日出等，我一向都是非常愛好的，這一個諷刺喜劇，雖則只是給觀衆笑笑，然而仔細體味起來，那是完全針對着現實的，針對着上海的，他抒寫許多只顧表面不問熒子的僞君子，每天奔來奔去，忙忙碌碌，無非裝裝樣子，擺擺威風而已。</p>
<p>洪謨導演「鈹金」的手法，頗見輕靈機警。演員方面，韓非飾馬壽卿，在假光頭上假裝假頭髮，無論說話，舉動，處處引人發笑。柏李的馬太太，演潑辣典型，恰到好處。其他如芷君的趙雲庭，梅邨的趙太太，賀賓的趙二叔，亦都稱職。而最風趣的是，天然飾趙文明，聲音怪，走路怪，姿勢更怪，簡直是個怪模怪樣的怪角色，他要說一句話，觀衆便跟着會笑起來，於是乎滿堂洋溢笑聲；－從開幕直笑到閉幕　。</p>
<p>除「鈹金」外，另外加演的獨幕劇是「求婚」，此劇爲契哥洛夫原著，平羣改編，佐臨導演。</p>
<p>在「求婚』裹，我們看到了欺貧愛富的李二爺，（嚴俊飾）也就是說剝去社會的外衣，看到了一般人的衆生相。劍平飾趙寳實，是个跛子，戴耘演李宋貞，是個駝背，二個醜人，碰在一起，劇本的故事，立意甚好，趣味極濃，我最愛嚴俊的李二爺，他唸台詞，熟而爛，爛而熟，即對於笑的，愁的，恨的道些表情，演來也通眞之至。</p>
<p>「鈹金」和「求婚」，都是上乘的諷刺喜劇，我站在一個純客觀的觀衆地位，願意虔試地爲愛好話劇諸君推薦。</p>
<h3>張文娟將返滬獻藝</h3>
<p>— 魯大夫</p>
<p>北平是平劇的發祥地，也是名伶的出產地，要求平劇的深造，最好到北平去「留學」，這裹要談的是張文娟，如前年抱着一顆奮鬥的心也毅然到了北平去，與上海暌違幾乎要兩年了。像這樣一個年輕的姑娘，已能唱出够味的音韻，悅耳的腔調，聽說她在平聲譽很好，也是替江南掙面子的一個女伶，此來北平炎熱，正歇夏在家，勤習崑曲，傳聞不久要到上海來登　了，憑她的天才和又經過兩年薰陶的藝術，以及在上海的人緣，將來一定可以得到最佳的收穫。</p>

<p>李自成駭得無計可施，牛金星一面便敎部下儘向火光處把箭放射，矢如飛蝗，保護住中軍帳，一面下令後面的部隊不得退後，退後者斬。周遇吉果然衝殺不入。一隻虎跨着滑背馬，搶了一柄棗陽槊，衝上前來，大喝「姓周的休要亂闖，我羅某決不怕你！」飛槊進刺，和周遇吉狠鬥。那邊許靖乘隙而入，衝殺了一回，也被亂箭射住，不能深入。聽得左邊喊殺聲烈，知道周遇吉正和流寇大戰，遂催動人馬向火光中殺來。兩邊混戰一陣。將近五鼓時分，周遇吉見流寇愈殺愈多，已有準備，自己恐被包圍，遂同許靖收兵而退。流寇在夜間亦不敢追殺。周遇吉退入城中，東方已漸漸發白，雨亦漸止。他對許靖說道：「今夜我們殺得甚爲酣暢該寇至少傷亡數千，可惜未能斬虜渠魁，但也挫折他們的銳氣了。」遂敎許靖和衆士卒去休息。他自己把城上防務交代給張烈范成，也回衙略睡一會。醒來時已近午刻，略進食物，聞該寇叉來攻城，他又上城去守禦。他所憂慮的弓矢恐要缺少，便敎工匠趕製。又令人民搬運石塊上城，以便堵禦。這天李自成爲夜間被官軍刦了營寨，受了折損，心中大爲憤努，所以候衆前來猛攻，西南兩門攻打得更厲害。周遇吉自守西城，命許靖張烈守南門，又令范成兼管東北二門。賊兵攻打了半天，固若金湯，不曾佔着半點兒便宜。李自成見代州道樣難下，周遇吉又是虎將，中心很是焦灼，再去太原調動大股流寇前來增援。自己把西南二門圍住，朝夕攻打。過了三天，官軍和流寇都有些疲倦。許靖在南門城上見城下流寇如雲，攻打益亟，原來流寇的生力軍巳開到，所以加緊攻城了。（一〇二）</p>

<h3>Political Advisor Lattimore Appointed; Sino-American Cooperation Becomes More Complete; Air Force Formed by American Aircraft to Appear; Major Change in China's War Situation Within Six Months</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 28th (United Press) - Today, it was officially announced that Lattimore, who has resided in China for a long time and is recognized as an expert on Pacific affairs, has been hired by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as an advisor for a term of six months. Chairman Chiang's appointment of Lattimore was recommended by President Roosevelt. It is reported that Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, who is currently in the United States, sent a telegram from President Roosevelt to China on June 23rd, stating that China's appointment of Lattimore as an advisor would be viewed in Washington as a major indication of increased understanding between China and the United States. The news of Lattimore's appointment has been well received here, as Lattimore's books and papers on Pacific issues are well-known and highly respected. Many Chinese officials here are also acquainted with Lattimore. Those who know Lattimore claim that he is well-versed in Pacific and world issues, making him highly suitable for this position. Lattimore is currently the Dean of the School of International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and also serves as the editor of the Pacific Affairs magazine published by the Pacific Council. His parents are American and he was born in Washington. He studied in England, America, and China. Lattimore can speak Chinese and Mongolian and can read Chinese, Mongolian, and Russian. Lattimore has spent most of his life in China and has traveled extensively throughout Mongolia. He is also recognized as an expert on Mongolian issues. He left China in 1936, after residing in Beiping that year, and then assumed his current position. He has spent most of his time in China engaged in academic work and investigating situations on behalf of the Pacific Council, but for a period of time, he worked as a reporter for the Times in Beiping and Tianjin. He has authored many books on China.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th - President Roosevelt has recommended Lattimore to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as his personal political advisor. Mr. Lattimore will soon leave the United States for China. Since 1938, he has served as a trustee of the Walter Hines Page School of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University, and since 1934, he has served as the editor of the Pacific Affairs Quarterly. He has never held a government position. His reputation as a political commentator stems from his long-term residence in China, extensive travel, deep understanding of the lives of the Chinese people, and sympathy for their aspirations. Mr. Lattimore is also an authoritative international commentator on Manchurian and Mongolian issues. He has offered profound criticisms of China's four years of resistance against Japan, believing that China is a major supporter of democratic politics, as China must not only build a new and independent democratic politics like other countries but also fight a desperate battle. Washington observers believe that Lattimore's appointment is a major manifestation of increasingly complete cooperation between China and the United States.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Reuters) - American aid to China is now gradually taking concrete form. According to reliable sources, one step in this regard will be the appointment of an American political advisor to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for consultation. His name has not yet been announced, but it is said that Lattimore will be given this appointment, as Lattimore is familiar with Far Eastern affairs, especially China and its borders. Lattimore is currently the head of a school in Washington. It is expected that the official appointment will be announced within a few days. The specific duties of the political advisor are not yet known, but it is generally believed that this appointment did not originate from the State Department but from the White House and is related to the aid-to-China organization established after Currie's visit to Chongqing for investigation. Currie is a White House aide currently in charge of aid to China. This matter, as well as the continued shipment of American aircraft and the dispatch of volunteer pilots and instructors to China, all demonstrate the baselessness of recent rumors that the United States intends to change its Far Eastern policy. A commentator for the Washington Post said that the time for further discussion of reaching a compromise with Japan has not yet come and is not generally accepted. Undoubtedly, Japan must first greatly change its policy before the United States can consider making changes. As of today, Tokyo shows no signs of making the necessary changes. According to well-informed sources, aid to China will definitely be expanded in the coming months. Within six months, China's war situation will be greatly changed, as it is generally believed that China will then be able to obtain an air force formed by American aircraft, which is far superior to what Japan is currently using in China. Therefore, at that time, the entire situation will not be one of Japan coveting Siberia or advancing south into the Dutch East Indies, but whether Japan can still maintain its current occupation of various parts of China.</p>
<h3>Washington Observers See Japan's Position Worsening</h3>
<p>Observers here believe that Japan is bewildered and confused by Hitler's sudden change in his relations with the Soviet Union and does not understand its intentions. People here found Tokyo's statement yesterday warning the United States not to ship supplies to Vladivostok to aid the Soviet Union quite interesting and are studying its implications. Some Far East experts believe that this is a threat to the United States, while others believe that it is an appeal to the United States, hoping that the United States will not add another complex and difficult problem to Japan, forcing Japan to make a decision that it already considers difficult. If the Soviet Union can resist Germany, then American aid through Vladivostok will likely cause Berlin to exert pressure on Japan, forcing Japan to either join the war or refuse to support its Axis allies. However, joining the war would not only mean directly fighting the Soviet Union but also clashing with Britain and the United States, while refusing to join the war would leave Japan politically and militarily isolated. At the same time, Japan has ultimately failed to extricate itself from the quagmire it is deeply mired in in China, as time has shown that Japan is powerless to end its war against China. Japan's position, as viewed from here, is deteriorating daily. Therefore, it is expected that it will not launch any aggressive actions for some time but will only quietly express its views while assessing the situation and harboring the futile hope that international events will take a turn favorable to Japan.</p>
<h3>United States Transfers Transport Aircraft to Britain</h3>
<p>New York, 28th (Reuters) - Mr. Graham, Chairman of the American Aircraft Transport Association, held a private meeting with leaders of American airlines on Thursday and stated that twelve transport aircraft must be handed over to Britain within the next four weeks, and another twelve aircraft must be handed over on August 1st. It has been determined that American domestic airlines have already transferred 22% of their aircraft to Britain. The sixteen major airlines currently have a total of 358 aircraft. Britain has now obtained 103 aerial transport aircraft from the United States.</p>
<h3>100,000 Chinese Youths Send Letter Thanking the United States for Aid</h3>
<p>Washington, 28th (United Press) - Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, yesterday presented Under Secretary of State Welles with a letter signed by 100,000 Chinese youths expressing gratitude for American aid to China. The letter will be forwarded to President Roosevelt on Sunday, at which time the President will present it to the new library at Hyde Park. Former Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Shi Zhaoji accompanied Dr. Hu Shih to Welles' office. The letter was enclosed in a beautiful Chinese silk case. The letter stated, "We hereby express our heartfelt gratitude to Your Excellency and the people of Your Excellency's country for the economic and material assistance you have given to our people."</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in the Dutch East Indies Begin to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - Local newspapers here reported yesterday that Japanese residents in the Dutch East Indies have now begun to evacuate back to Japan, as negotiations for a trade agreement between the two countries have broken down. Mr. Yoshizawa, the head of the Japanese delegation, and his entire delegation have already left Batavia.</p>
<h3>Japanese Seize Goods in Hanoi</h3>
<p>Hanoi, 28th (United Press) - According to reliable sources, the Japanese authorities here yesterday seized goods stored in warehouses here before the Thai-Vietnamese War. This action is no different from the Japanese seizure of American goods in warehouses in Haiphong last month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Purchase Rubber in Thailand</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 18th (Reuters) - Thai newspapers today reported on the Japanese purchase of rubber and tin in Thailand, stating that there are currently at least ten representatives of Japanese rubber companies who are heavily purchasing Thai rubber and rubber plantations. Since May 1st, the Japanese have purchased no fewer than ten rubber plantations. As of the end of May, Japanese ships had transported a total of 200,000 tons of rubber. It is reported that Japanese ships refuse to transport rubber that does not belong to the Japanese Rubber Association out of the country. Tin from some areas of Thailand has traditionally been transported in large quantities to Malaya, but mine owners now plan to transport their tin to Bangkok, as the price in Bangkok is higher than in Malaya.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Passes Huge Army Budget; Total Exceeds Ten Billion Dollars; Specified Large Sum for Purchase of 13,000 Aircraft</h3>
<p>Washington, 27th (Havas) - The Senate today passed the Army budget for 1941. The bill stipulates that the total expenditure is $10,384,821,624, of which $3,000,000,000 is specified for the purchase of 12,856 aircraft and other equipment. The Senate had previously increased the expenditure in the original bill by $558,312,132 for the construction of ordnance factories. This amendment must be reviewed by the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate yesterday passed a record-breaking Army supply bill and immediately sent it to the House of Representatives for consideration of increasing the expenditure by $558,000,000. This increase is necessary for the construction of munitions factories.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (United Press) - The Senate Naval Affairs Committee yesterday denied the Navy Department's request to retain Navy personnel until the danger period has passed but passed a bill to be enacted when Congress deems it necessary, allowing volunteers to continue their service. The Committee also approved the Navy Department's employment of 300 counterintelligence agents to protect naval construction.</p>

<h3>What is Japan Waiting For?</h3>
<p>The German-Soviet war has been going on for a week. Countries, whether neutral or non-neutral, have almost all expressed their positions. Even small countries like Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, on the Axis side, have either broken off diplomatic relations or joined the war. Only Japan, which first signed an alliance with Germany and Italy, is still hesitant and carefully observing the situation in meetings. This is truly a spectacle in modern diplomatic history. No wonder the world wants to ask: What exactly is Japan waiting for?</p>
<p>Imagining the current Tokyo government's situation, it is indeed in a difficult position, unable to make a decisive decision. Declaring neutrality seems too unfair to the Allied countries. Invoking the alliance would violate the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, which was achieved with great difficulty, and would also be equivalent to officially joining the German-Italian front and independently confronting China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in the Far East! This dilemma, although a natural result of Matsuoka's multifaceted diplomacy, is definitely not something that Matsuoka can undo and remedy today. In this awkward situation, it is natural to remain silent for the time being. This silence, even if it is glorified as carefully observing the situation, in reality, on the one hand, indicates that a heated debate between pro-German and non-pro-German factions is raging within Japan, and on the other hand, exposes that the Konoe government still needs to observe the evolution of the European war situation in the future before it can judge which side it is most advantageous to join. Japan's state of indecision is certainly due to the fact that it has been using troops in China for four years and its strength has been depleted by more than half, so it must be cautious about everything. However, there is another major factor that the Konoe generation must consider, and that is whether it is in Japan's best interest to promote the formal merger of the European and Asian wars?</p>
<p>From the outbreak of the European war the year before last until Germany attacked the Soviet Union last week, the Soviet Union was the only "fence-sitter" among the major countries in the world. It clearly implemented completely different and even contradictory policies for the European and Asian wars: in Europe, it was close to Germany, indirectly fueling the flames of aggression; in the Far East, it directly aided anti-aggression China to strike Japan. This was a contradiction in the Soviet Union itself. From a global perspective, it was also a major obstacle to the establishment of a firm democratic front. The European and Asian wars could have merged long ago, but due to the influence of the Soviet Union's dual diplomacy, the international situation has never been thoroughly clarified in the past two years. Now that the Soviet Union is on the same front as China and Britain, if Japan's "expression of attitude" is the result of deciding to invoke the Tripartite Pact and assist the Axis powers in combat, then whether it advances south, north, or even west, the current European and Asian wars will immediately merge into a whole world war; because at that time, Japan will formally assist the Axis, and Britain and the Soviet Union will naturally have no reason to maintain neutrality towards Japan. In this division, the democratic countries' lineup is clearly "stronger" than the aggressor countries. If there are no new factors, it is expected that Japan may not be willing to immediately "throw itself into the trap." The reason why it is still observing and considering today is probably for this reason. In other words, Japan must at least wait for the German-Soviet war to be decided, convincing itself that the Soviet Union is no longer to be feared, and further convincing itself that the strength of the democratic front has been relatively diminished, before it dares to express its attitude. Before that, even if there is any expression, it may have to be made with extreme reservation and extreme ambiguity. However, if Germany's attack on the Soviet Union is extraordinarily successful and Hitler truly defeats the Soviet Union in a short period of time, then Japan will definitely believe that its golden opportunity has arrived. It will probably volunteer to fulfill the alliance without Hitler's urging.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that the future outcome of the German-Soviet war will not only determine Japan's future position but also affect the trend of the entire situation, because whether the two wars in the East and West formally merge will also depend on who wins or loses this war?</p>
<h3>New Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi Pays Respects to Chairman Chiang, Reports on Talks with Roosevelt, Date of Assumption of Office Not Yet Announced</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The new Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi paid respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek today, reporting on the current situation in Britain, his talks with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull when passing through the United States, and the situations in Honolulu, the Philippines, Singapore, and Yangon. The date of Guo's assumption of office has not yet been announced. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The new Foreign Minister and former Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi, arrived here yesterday from Kunming. Government officials and diplomats, such as British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, Belgian Ambassador Jules Guillaume, former Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui, and Foreign Minister Xu Mo, all welcomed him at the airport. Guo was full of energy and in good spirits. After getting off the plane, he shook hands and exchanged greetings with those welcoming him on the scene and foreign reporters. Regarding the Soviet-German war, he said that the international situation had been clarified as a result, placing the countries resisting aggression in one group. Guo was unwilling to express any opinions until he had submitted his report on his talks in London and Washington to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He then mentioned the Yunnan-Burma Road, saying that he had traveled 24,000 miles, traveling by car only on the segments of Rangoon and Kunming, and traveling by plane for the rest. The Yunnan-Burma Road is China's lifeline and a symbol of ABC (America, Britain, and China) cooperation, so he felt that he must make a pilgrimage to it before taking office as Foreign Minister. He was delighted to have met with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull and other leaders in the United States and received their hospitality. He also had the opportunity to see the defenses of Honolulu, Singapore, and Myanmar. The Saodang Daily commented in its welcome of Guo's arrival in Chongqing that the new Foreign Minister had already made important achievements while returning home from London via the United States, exchanging letters with Hull on the United States' abandonment of extraterritorial rights in China. There was an air raid alarm in Kunming yesterday morning, so Guo's departure was slightly delayed, but Japanese planes did not fly near Kunming. Guo arrived in Kunming by car on June 24th, and Yunnan Chairman Long Yun greeted him in the suburbs. Guo said in Kunming that he had inspected the sea, land, and air defenses of Singapore and believed that the defenses were strong and could defeat any attack. The recent developments, such as the Soviet-German war, are beneficial to China. Friendly countries are providing China with all possible assistance. The Yunnan-Burma Road has now received as much attention overseas as the Atlantic. He was deeply impressed by the condition of this road and hoped that it would continue to be improved. Yu Feipeng, who is in charge of the administrative affairs of the Yunnan-Burma Road, arrived in Chongqing on the same plane as Guo. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>52 Japanese Aircraft Attack Sichuan in Batches</h3>
<p>Chongqing - On the 28th, 52 Japanese aircraft attacked Sichuan in two batches. The first batch of 27 aircraft entered the southern suburbs of Chongqing at 1:52 pm, dropped bombs, and then fled. The losses were very minor. The second batch of 25 aircraft flew to Zhongxian, then turned back and dropped bombs in Wanxian, and then fled. The damage is unknown. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This afternoon, 54 Japanese aircraft bombed the South Hot Springs, a place quite far from Chongqing on the south bank of the Yangtze River. The air raid alarm was issued when Japanese aircraft were spotted entering Sichuan. Just as the Japanese aircraft appeared over the city, a sudden thunderstorm occurred. Apparently, due to the low cloud cover, the Japanese aircraft abandoned their attempt to bomb Chongqing and shifted their attention to the South Hot Springs, 15 miles from Chongqing. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - An air raid alarm was issued in Chongqing this afternoon, but soon the sky became overcast, so the Japanese aircraft were unable to attack. It is reported that two teams of Japanese aircraft, each with 27 aircraft, bombed the hot spring area 20 miles south of Chongqing. (United Press, 28th)</p>

<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Calls on Democratic Countries to Launch an Offensive Against Japan, Defeat the Japanese Army Before Japan Attacks Siberia, Allowing the Soviet Union to Concentrate Its Forces to Resist Western Front Aggression</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Daily News recently called on the democratic countries to launch an attack against Japan quickly and without further delay. The newspaper stated that the most urgent and effective way to aid the Soviet Union is for China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and Australia to jointly launch an offensive against Japan, defeating Japan before Japan attacks Siberia. If this is done, Moscow can concentrate its forces to cope with the aggression on the western front. The Communist Party's newspaper Xinhua Daily stated that the Soviet-German war has caused Japan to postpone its southward advance, but Japan's anti-communist elements are now actively planning to attack Siberia and occupy Vladivostok. In order to achieve the freedom to advance north, Japan may accelerate the war against China so that the Japanese army in mainland China can be transferred to Manchuria. The newspaper also stated that in order to implement the northward advance plan, the Konoe cabinet may be replaced. The Xinmin Daily stated emphatically that regardless of whether Germany or the Soviet Union wins, China will win. If the Soviet Union wins, China will also win against Japan, but if the German army reaches Moscow, Japan will attack Siberia, and Britain and the United States will also clash with Japan, prompting Japan's early collapse. The newspaper also pointed out that if Japan attacks Siberia, the Communist Party's 18th Group Army will launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army in North China to aid the Soviet Union. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Saodang Daily recently called on the 18th Group Army to launch an offensive against Japan to aid the Soviet Union. The newspaper stated, "Now, the 18th Group Army, in view of the fact that the interests of its motherland China and the Third International have become aligned, should launch an eastern offensive to ravage the left flank of the Japanese Kwantung Army in order to defend China and Siberia. The Chinese Communist Party should thoroughly correct its past attitude of disregarding national interests. We now hope to see these people realize this new effort." (28th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles on the Belorussian Border, Soviet Troops Retreat to New Positions, German Troops Approach Site of Napoleon's Defeat, Battle for Galicia Region Underway, Red Army Crosses Danube River and Occupies Oliten Territory</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 28th - Military observers here recently stated that the battle lines between the Soviet Union and Germany are currently roughly as follows: (1) On the central front, after Soviet troops retreated to the border of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, German troops are about to advance directly on Minsk, the capital of the republic. The Soviet retreat was preceded by strategic counterattacks, aided by aircraft, indicating a planned operation. It is noteworthy that the battlefield the German troops are now approaching is the site of Napoleon's defeat many years ago. (2) On the northern front, the Red Army continues to defend the line of the Daugava River, with German troops advancing very slowly from Latvia. (3) On the southern front, part of the German forces are hindered by swampy terrain. Although the counterattack by the Red Army's mechanized units in the Volhynia region has been successful, their flanks are threatened. At the same time, several Red Army divisions near Lviv are also at risk of being encircled.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - Moscow Radio announced today that fierce battles are currently underway around Lviv in the Galician region and the towns around Bialystok in northeastern Poland, with both sides alternating between offense and defense.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 28th - The Soviet Information Bureau announced in its war report today that "fierce battles are taking place in the areas of Salay, Vilnius, and Baranovichi. After inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, our troops began to withdraw to new positions on the night of the 27th to reorganize for further actions. Fierce battles raged throughout the night in the Lutsk area and the Skureny area on the Bessarabian front. There was no fighting on other fronts. On the night of the 27th, enemy aircraft heavily bombed Borisov (northeast of Minsk), Bobruisk (southeast of Minsk), and Mogilev (east of Minsk). On the 26th, our air force continued to attack enemy tank units in Vilnius, Brody, and Baranovichi. The enemy suffered very heavy losses. Our aircraft heavily bombed Ploesti and inflicted heavy damage, and Constanta was also heavily bombed by our forces, suffering significant losses."</p>
<p>United Press International, London, 28th - The announcement by Moscow last night that Soviet troops were withdrawing to new positions indicates that the Red Army is now retreating to the Stalin Line within the old Soviet borders in the Minsk province. Military observers here say that Moscow's announcement of constant Nazi air raids on Borisov, Bobruisk, and Mogilev indicates that a large number of Soviet troops are concentrated in several strongholds behind the Stalin Line. During the First European War, Minsk was the headquarters of the Red Army in Belorussia, and Mogilev was the headquarters of Grand Duke Nicholas, the commander-in-chief of the Russian army. It is generally believed that Germany's relentless bombing of Borisov and the other three cities is a consistent Nazi strategy to destroy concentration points behind the lines before attacking the positions.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - A recent Soviet communique announced that there were no new aerial battles, but for the first time mentioned the Soviet fleet, saying that it had cooperated with the air force in bombing the German naval base of Constanta on the Romanian Black Sea coast. The communique also said that yesterday a Soviet cavalry division routed a German regiment in Bessarabia, and that last night a Soviet force, aided by small warships, forced its way into the Danube River, occupied advantageous positions, and captured 500 enemy soldiers, 11 cannons, and a large quantity of ammunition. On the northern section of the front, the Soviet side announced that it had launched a counterattack during the retreat, inflicting a major defeat on the enemy. A large-scale attack by German tanks on Minsk (the capital of Belorussia, within 20 miles of Russia proper) had been repelled, a German headquarters had been captured, and a German general had been killed. Forty German tanks had been destroyed. In the Lutsk and Lviv areas, German forces had deployed large numbers of tanks to join the battle in an attempt to break through the lines, but repeated attempts to attack had been repulsed by Soviet forces and suffered heavy losses. On the Bessarabian front, German preparations for a major offensive near Skureny on the Prut River had been thwarted. On the Romanian border, Soviet forces captured a total of 800 German and Romanian soldiers. The communique concluded with a proud statement that the entire front from Bialystok to the Black Sea was now firmly defended by our forces.</p>
<h3>Germans Claim Soviet Division Destroyed</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - The German official news agency reported on the war situation, stating that German forces had destroyed a large number of tanks and captured many intact tanks. In one sector, the German Bavarian Alpine Mountain Army crushed a Soviet armored division, capturing many cannons and destroying a hundred tanks. In another sector, a Soviet division and its attached armored regiment were annihilated. The people of the Soviet-occupied border welcomed the German troops who had come to liberate them. A Lithuanian artillery unit and a Cossack unit of 200 men had surrendered to the German army. The German air force had also achieved victories. One squadron had destroyed 21 Soviet aircraft and scattered a Soviet truck convoy.</p>
<h3>Leningrad Threatened on Three Sides</h3>
<p>According to Lyon Radio, fierce battles are raging around Lviv (Lemberg). Although non-official sources on the Axis side claim that German troops have occupied Lviv, the area is still largely in Soviet hands. The radio station also said that the Nazi side believes that after five days of fierce fighting, the border battle can be considered over, with the results completely in favor of the German side. Attention is now focused on Leningrad, which is now threatened on three sides by German troops and Finnish troops within the Baltic states and by aerial bombardment. Four Soviet divisions are currently concentrated around Leningrad.</p>
<h3>German Crossing of the Prut River Thwarted</h3>
<p>Continued fighting in the Skureny region suggests that German efforts to force a crossing of the Prut River into northeastern Bessarabia have not made any progress. Dispatches from Ankara say that the German forced crossing has failed, and Soviet troops are valiantly counterattacking in various places. Soviet sources report that Soviet aircraft have bombed military targets in Ploesti, the Romanian oil city, and Constanta on the Black Sea coast, causing them significant damage.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Air Force Attacks Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Within hours of Hungary's declaration of war on the Soviet Union yesterday, the Hungarian air force launched an attack on the Soviet Union. Hungarian Radio broadcast a communique from the German general staff of the Hungarian army, saying that in retaliation for the Soviet air raids on Hungary, a large number of Hungarian aircraft had attacked Soviet military targets, causing fires and heavy damage. Soviet artillery units in several areas of the front had been retaliated against by Hungarian artillery units. Today (Friday), Soviet aircraft again flew over Hungarian territory but were unable to drop bombs and were driven back by Hungarian defenses.</p>
<h3>Baltic Naval District Declares Martial Law</h3>
<p>The Soviet troops fighting the German mechanized units advancing on Minsk are commanded by General Kuznetsov, a young Soviet general. Kuznetsov was the commander of the North Caucasus Military District last year and was transferred to the commander of the Baltic Special Military District last month. Last night, he issued an order declaring martial law in the three Baltic states and instructed the people to fulfill their duty to the motherland and assist the army in resisting paratroopers and the Fifth Column. Anyone found assisting the enemy will be tried and punished by a military tribunal. Informed sources in Ankara confirm that the Axis forces have failed to force a crossing of the Prut River into Bessarabia. Soviet troops on the southern front are fighting with great bravery. Soviet aircraft have attacked military targets in Ploesti, causing them heavy damage. Dispatches from Ankara report that Soviet troops are attacking and counterattacking at various points on the southern front. Ankara continues to transmit startling news from the Axis powers, such as the destruction of 2,000 Soviet aircraft in the first two days of the war. However, the ratio of Soviet aircraft destroyed on the ground and in the air transmitted by these messages is vastly different.</p>
<h3>Red Army Soldiers Fight Bravely</h3>
<p>Soviet communiques state that our soldiers are fighting with great bravery. General Mantin's armored division dispersed an enemy motorized unit preparing to cross the river, destroying six enemy cannons and three pontoons. Half of the enemy troops were killed or wounded. Lieutenant Matruk shot down three enemy aircraft in aerial combat. Lieutenant Xian engaged in a fierce battle with German fighter aircraft for an hour, and although he sustained three wounds, he safely returned to his defenses. The people are doing their best to assist the army in fighting and are very clear about their duty to the motherland.</p>
<h3>Turku, Finland, Heavily Bombed</h3>
<p>Swedish newspapers report from Helsinki that Soviet bombers attacked Turku, Finland, on Thursday night in waves of seven or nine aircraft, dropping bombs in a heavy bombardment. Turku has been attacked for two days, resulting in ten deaths and twenty-seven injuries. According to news from Stockholm, there is widespread criticism of the German communiques there. Berlin is rife with rumors, all awaiting good news. A dispatch from a Swedish visitor in Berlin said that so far Berlin has not announced any concrete news. Rumors about the progress of the war mostly come from foreign sources. Many Berliners say that "German troops are advancing rapidly and unimpeded," so there has not been time to publish detailed war reports. The Berlin military no longer talks about when victory will be achieved.</p>
<h3>German Forces Launch Offensive in the Far North</h3>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 28th - The French news agency reported from Stockholm, Sweden, that Colonel Brett, a Swedish military expert, claimed that German Alpine troops had launched an offensive from Norway towards the Kola Peninsula and the port of Murmansk. At the same time, German aircraft were bombing the peninsula's highly modernized air force base. Brett also criticized the difference between the German offensive against the Soviet Union and the strategy used in the invasion of France last year, saying that the German General Staff seemed to recognize that the Soviet Union's motorized cavalry was superior to the French, so the German leaders did not immediately commit tanks to the forefront of the fighting, but sometimes first used artillery bombardment, followed by infantry and aerial reconnaissance, and only added tanks in the second phase of the attack. Reuters, Stockholm, 28th - According to Finnish newspapers, Finnish artillery will begin bombarding the Soviet defenses in the port of Hanko. The port originally belonged to Finland but was ceded to the Soviet Union last year.</p>
<h3>Cossacks Inflict Heavy Damage on German Troops</h3>
<p>United Press International, Moscow, 28th - Another communique today said that six German infantry regiments attempting to cross the Prut River had been annihilated by savage Cossacks. The communique continued, saying that the German attempt to flank Lviv had also been repulsed. Fierce fighting is taking place in the Minsk and Lutsk areas. The German 39th Tank Corps has been defeated.</p>
<h3>Nazi Paratroopers All Annihilated</h3>
<p>United Press International, Moscow, 28th - Colonel Spirlet told reporters here yesterday that the German paratroopers who had landed behind Soviet lines had been completely annihilated. These German paratroopers were all wearing Red Army uniforms or Soviet police uniforms. He said that on Thursday, armed peasants in the Lviv region captured a group of German paratroopers wearing Soviet police uniforms, who were carrying Soviet trade coupons and typewriters.</p>
<h3>German Troops Using Deception in Warfare</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - According to the Soviet official news agency, three days ago a German regiment, disguised in Red Army uniforms, attempted to invade Soviet territory. A Soviet company at the time had bombarded them with heavy artillery fire. However, after the German soldiers shouted, "We are friends, stop firing!" the Soviet troops, unsuspecting of treachery, immediately ceased fire. Soon after, they discovered that they had been surrounded. After recognizing that they were German soldiers in disguise, they immediately used hand grenades to fight their way out and sprayed the German troops with heavy machine guns, inflicting heavy losses on them, before narrowly escaping annihilation.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Soviet Capital Moving in Preparation for Prolonged War, Anti-Soviet Conspiracy Uncovered in Moscow</h3>
<p>United Press International, Stockholm, 28th - The "Aftonbladet" newspaper here yesterday received news from Ankara that the Soviet government plans to move its capital from Moscow to Sverdlovsk in the Ural Mountains. It also said that a "large anti-Soviet conspiracy" had been discovered in Moscow, and the authorities had arrested dozens of people involved.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Moscow, 27th - "Pravda" published an editorial today stating, "The German-Soviet war may be prolonged. Temporary setbacks should not lead to despair. We should also prepare for the greatest sacrifices to overcome difficulties. No matter how things develop in the future, our country will achieve final victory."</p>
<h3>German Victory Report to Be Published Today</h3>
<p>United Press International, Berlin, 28th - After two postponements, the High Command has now definitely announced that a special report will be published on Sunday, June 29th, revealing a major German victory on the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3>Countries Under Nazi Yoke Form Anti-Soviet Front, Denmark Announces Severance of Relations with Soviet Union, Vichy Wishes to Stay Out of It</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 28th - As of last night, ten of the fourteen countries in Europe had joined the anti-Soviet front, but France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Norway, and Greece are not included. Their war materials are available for Germany to use freely. Of these ten countries, seven have declared war on the Soviet Union, namely Germany, Italy, Romania, Finland, Hungary, Slovakia, and Croatia. In addition, Sweden, Spain, and Denmark either expressed sympathy, sent volunteer troops to attack the Soviet Union, severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, or otherwise expressed neutrality, such as Switzerland, Portugal, Turkey, and Bulgaria, but all expressed sympathy with Germany. In both the free and occupied zones of France, volunteers are being recruited. As for the volunteers from Norway, they have already set off for the Finnish front.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - Denmark, under the yoke of Germany no less than Hungary, is reported to have severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Reported to Re-emerge</h3>
<p>United Press International, Rome, 28th - The "Corriere della Sera" newspaper in Rome today published a message from Ankara, citing Soviet diplomatic sources as saying that former Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov will be appointed to a senior government position. According to these sources, Litvinov will be appointed as the diplomatic director for all matters related to the cooperation between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 27th - Sources here recently stated that France is completely staying out of the current German-Soviet war. Marshal Pétain's trip to Paris is unrelated to the Soviet-Finnish War or international issues. The Franco-Spanish talks are continuing to be conducted by the relevant authorities and there is unlikely to be any important development in the short term. Some newspapers in Paris have published reports that volunteers organized by Déat, the leader of the "Rassemblement National Populaire," intend to participate in the war against the Soviet Union. The Vichy government has no knowledge of this and considers it purely imaginary.</p>
<h3>Soviet Agricultural and Transport Industries Forced to Work Overtime</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 28th - The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has issued an order requiring supervisors in the agricultural, industrial, and transport sectors to implement a system of forced overtime work, ranging from one to three hours per day. Pregnant women and nursing mothers are exempt. Overtime work will be paid at half the basic wage. The Presidium will announce an order granting allowances to the families of officers and soldiers during wartime.</p>

<h3>British Military and Economic Missions Arrive in Moscow, Molotov Immediately Receives Them, Britain Decides to Fulfill Its Promise of Aid to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 28th - British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps has returned to Moscow. Arriving with him are the British military and economic missions. The military mission includes Lieutenant General MacFarlane, Vice Admiral Miles, and Air Vice Marshal Collyer. The economic mission includes Carter and three others. Among those welcoming them at the station were the Secretary-General of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Sublev, and personnel from the British Embassy.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - British Ambassador Sir Stafford Cripps, accompanied by the British military and economic missions, has returned to Moscow. He subsequently visited Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov to introduce the members of the mission and his entire diplomatic staff. The members of the British military mission include Lieutenant General MacFarlane, Acting Captain Acland, Air Vice Marshal Collyer, and Rear Admiral Miles. The fact that the mission arrived in Moscow within five days of Prime Minister Churchill's guarantee of aid to the Soviet Union and that the members of the mission are all capable people shows that the British government is fully fulfilling its promise. Lieutenant General MacFarlane, 51, is the highest British authority on German military tactics. He served as the military attache in Germany during Hitler's preparations for war, and before that, he served as military attache in Prague, Budapest, and Vienna. It was MacFarlane who delivered Hitler's "final conditions" to Prague during the Munich crisis. After the outbreak of war, MacFarlane went to France as director of military intelligence and was responsible for security during the King's inspection of the front lines. Rear Admiral Miles, 51, is a navigation expert and former commander of the Mediterranean minesweeping and destroyer fleets. From 1939, he was the captain of the battleship HMS Nelson. Air Vice Marshal Collyer represents the British Air Force. He was a member of the British mission to Moscow during the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in 1939. From 1934 to 1937, he was the first British air force attache to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Soviet General to Adopt a War of Attrition to Trap German Forces - Observations from the Japanese Commercial Newspaper</h3>
<p>Tokyo, June 28 (Reuters) - Today's "Chugai Commercial News" published an article commenting on the Soviet-German war, questioning whether a decisive victory would be determined in the short term, or whether it would become a protracted war. The article stated that this question is of utmost importance to Japan, and that Japan's policy toward the European war must consider this question before determining its course. Germany seems confident that it can end the war within two or three months, but it is questionable whether the Soviet Union will allow Germany to succeed in this strategy. The Soviet Union will likely adopt a strategy of attrition to trap the German forces, and if so, retreating to the Ural Mountains would be a sound strategy. This strategy was once used to defeat Napoleon, but it is doubtful whether this old strategy can still be applied in modern warfare. The article concluded that Britain and the United States likely hope that the war will be prolonged. As the war progresses, their assistance to the Soviet Union will intensify, and changes in the Far East relationship must be taken into account.</p>
<h3>General Gamelin Flees - Major Search in French Territory</h3>
<p>Vichy, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - General Gamelin, who once served as the commander-in-chief of the Anglo-French Allied Forces, was arrested by General Pétain on September 16 of last year and subsequently confined with several other political leaders in the Polla Saul Building. Yesterday morning at 11 o'clock, General Gamelin escaped from the building and his whereabouts are unknown. A nationwide secret search is underway.</p>
<h3>Welles' Statement - U.S. Decides to Provide Material Aid to the Soviet Union - Umansky Extremely Excited - "Toho" Newspaper Believes It Is a Threat to Japan</h3>
<p>Washington, June 27 (TASS) - After a meeting between Soviet Ambassador to the United States Umansky and U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles today, he told reporters, "I called on the Acting Secretary of State, Welles, to formally inform him of the predatory attack by the Soviet Union. I have received a clear answer from the Acting Secretary of State regarding the US government's attitude toward this attack and the future relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. The Acting Secretary of State announced that any issues arising from the German attack on Soviet territory will receive the immediate and friendly attention of the US government. On June 23, I presented Welles with Molotov's speech. This conversation was extremely exciting." The State Department also announced that Umansky had visited Welles to formally inform the State Department of the fact of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Welles told Umansky that "in accordance with the policies declared by the US President and the State Department, any material assistance requested by the Soviet government will receive the immediate and friendly attention and consideration of the US."</p>
<p>Washington, June 28 (International News Service) - Yesterday, the Senate government faction predicted that the non-interventionist faction's attempts to prevent supplies from being shipped to the Soviet Union would be defeated. There may be a war of words regarding President Roosevelt's policy of trying his best to aid the Soviet Union. Soviet Ambassador Umansky's visit to Under Secretary of State Welles and the failure to express any reaction from Moscow to the US proposal to aid the Soviet Union is now attracting great attention.</p>
<p>Hyde Park, June 28 (Reuters) - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday about US aid to the Soviet Union to resist Germany, saying that he would discuss the matter with Welles when he received the report on Thursday's conversation between the Soviet ambassador and Under Secretary of State Welles. When a reporter asked how long it would take for the United States to produce a large number of national defense supplies, the President replied that such a broad question could not be answered practically. The time required varies depending on the item. The production of some items has already reached its peak, while other items will not reach their peak until six months, eight months, or a year later.</p>
<p>Rome, June 27 (Havas) - The "Sella Daily" here recently carried news that all the ships of the Baltic Sea coastal countries, which were mostly anchored in American ports after these countries were incorporated into the Soviet Union, may now be used by the United States to transport arms to the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union only has 50,000 ships overseas, which is not enough to meet the demand. In short, the extent of US aid to the Soviet Union will depend entirely on Japan's attitude.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Discusses Military Status</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Konoe met with military generals yesterday to discuss Japan's military status. At the same time, former Home Minister General Suekichi and former Prime Minister General Hayashi, etc., also discussed the political situation with leaders of various political parties.</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - At yesterday's cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Matsuoka gave a report on the German-Soviet war. After the meeting, Matsuoka met with German Ambassador Ott for an hour and a half. The content was not announced.</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Army Minister Tojo met with the Japanese Emperor this morning to report on military issues. In the afternoon, Japanese political leaders will meet again with senior army and navy officials to discuss important matters. Prime Minister Konoe will personally chair the meeting.</p>
<p>Washington, June 28 (United Press) - People here today predict that Japan may block Vladivostok.</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - A Japanese government spokesman said that we must pay attention to what kind of assistance the United States will provide to the Soviet Union from Vladivostok. If the United States provides aid to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok, it would be very dangerous, and Japan would be in a difficult position. The spokesman continued that Japan would not issue an official statement on the German-Soviet conflict for the time being, so I cannot express anything.</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - Regarding the US official's announced promise to aid the Soviet Union, Japanese newspapers regard it as a threat to Japan. They all say that Japan should prevent US munitions from reaching Vladivostok via the Pacific Ocean. The "Asahi Shimbun," "Kokumin Shimbun," and "Yomiuri Shimbun" all said that effective US aid to the Soviet Union can be regarded as an indirect hostile attitude toward Japan, and its intention to threaten Japan's position is self-evident.</p>
<p>June 28 (United Press) - Responsible Japanese officials here yesterday believed that if US warships patrolled the West Pacific to ensure that US supplies were not plundered by Germany on their way to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok, Japan could not remain indifferent to the matter.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Say Japan Is Confused and at a Loss</p>
<p>London, June 28 (Reuters) - Today's editorial in the "Manchester Guardian" said that Japan is truly unfortunate. It has been painstakingly operating to harm its neighbors and benefit itself, but its actions are often unsatisfactory. Although it boasts of military victories, its war against the stubborn and undefeated China has so far kept it exhausted. Although it celebrates diplomatic success, today it does not know what to do. Hitler's war against the Soviet Union, from one perspective, has made Japan confused and at a loss. Japan's old policy could be an immediate temptation to attack the Soviet Union, but the war in China is holding it back, and the British and American declarations of their intention to do everything possible to aid the Soviet Union cannot be ignored. If it attacks the Soviet Union, while the war of resistance in China is still very strong, the US warning cannot be ignored, and the strength of the Soviet Union should not be underestimated, it would be a very dangerous gamble. Japan's embarrassing situation is mostly due to Hitler. Hitler first encouraged Japan's anti-communist sentiments, then recognized the Soviet Union as a friend, stimulating Japan, and then wooed the Soviet Union and Japan to form a new alliance. Finally, less than three months after the Soviet-Japanese alliance, he suddenly attacked the Soviet Union, making Japan laugh and cry.</p>
<p>Bombay, June 28 (Reuters) - Indian newspapers commented on the difficult position Japan encountered due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The "Times of India" said that the Japanese government has been hesitating for several days, trying to reconcile what cannot be reconciled and solve what cannot be solved, and as a result, there is no successful method. It has no choice but to sit and watch the war between the two major countries to which Japan has corresponding treaty obligations. Compared to German diplomacy, Japan is just an infant in its arms. Japan was full of confidence that it had the guarantee of Soviet neutrality to guard against, but it never considered the possibility of a Soviet-German conflict. Matsuoka may now realize that Hitler is not easy to deal with, and that the value of the treaty with Germany is worthless, and is considering changing his plans. The "Madras Mail" also said that the most difficult issue arising from the Soviet-German war is Japan's attitude. The Japanese are not stupid, and they should now understand the ultimate fate of cooperating with Hitler. If the Soviet Union is defeated, Japan will face an even greater crisis of being driven by Germany.</p>
<h3>British Air Force Launches Fierce Offensive Against Germany, Bombing German Industrial Areas and Naval Ports</h3>
<p>London, June 28 (Reuters) - The British Air Force launched an extremely fierce offensive against Germany and the occupied areas yesterday. During the day, British planes soared over the English Channel skies once and roamed over northern France twice. At night, they again attacked German industrial areas and naval bases in Kiel, Cologne, and Dusseldorf. At sunset, British bombers, protected by large squadrons of fighters, flew out in batches, and soon the vibrations of exploding bombs were heard across the Channel, and the sound of cannons boomed. German land defenses obviously increased their resistance. The Air Ministry's information office said that the first to launch the attack during the day were the Ballenham coastal bombers, protected by fighters. One plane dropped a bomb on a German supply ship in the Channel, hitting its stern and sinking immediately. An enemy ship with a load of about 3,000 tons was also dive-bombed. When the first attack was launched during the day, two squadrons of Polish fighters searched for enemy planes but did not encounter them, so they attacked enemy airfields, strafing the hangars. Three enemy planes were destroyed in the field, and four were damaged. When Kiel was bombed, many bombs fell, and docks and shipyards caught fire. The German Coastal Defense Command is now located there, and it is also the main base for the German Navy's attack on the Soviet Union. When British planes attacked Cologne and Dusseldorf, the weather was poor, but they still found their targets and bombed them fiercely. Several German fighters intercepted British planes attacking Cologne, but one was shot down.</p>
<p>London, June 28 (Reuters) - In order to continue its continuous offensive throughout the day, the British Air Force repeatedly flew across the English Channel and northern France yesterday, followed by night attacks on targets in northwestern Germany. Many squadrons were dispatched across the English Channel again this morning. Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven were the targets of heavy bombing. Twelve British bombers were missing. This morning, multiple squadrons of British planes flew across the coast from two different directions. After crossing the French coast, the British planes went deep inland to carry out bombing, so residents on this side of the English Channel only heard distant explosions and saw large squadrons of British planes flying high in formation an hour later. Most of them seemed to be fighters. Enemy plane activity over Britain last night was still on a small scale. Bombs fell in western Britain, South Wales, and various parts of East Anglia. A small number of residents were injured, and the damage was minimal. One enemy bomber was destroyed last night.</p>
<h3>American Planes Show Their Skills in the Western Desert Air War</h3>
<p>London, June 28 (Reuters) - New-style American-made Tomahawk bombers and fighters showed their skills in the Western Desert air war on Thursday. Among them, the Tomahawk fighter was still in its first large-scale engagement with German planes. According to an Air Ministry press release, at least twelve enemy planes were destroyed in the air battle, and many more were severely damaged. An Australian pilot who drove a Tomahawk fighter to attack the Ghazala airfield told people that we saw several enemy planes parked on the south side of the airfield, and immediately dropped bombs and bombed them, none of which escaped. It is said that one of the most intense scenes in the air battle was when ten Tomahawk fighters engaged thirty German Me-109s, shooting down at least four German planes and destroying many others. Later, they shot down an Italian fighter. According to an air force pilot, the performance of the Tomahawk plane is great.</p>
<h3>German Embassy in China Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Shanghai, June 28 (Haitong News Agency) - Mr. Code, the information officer of the German Embassy in China, issued the following press release yesterday: I heard several days ago the false reports about the air battle in the English Channel issued by the British. I am now specially issuing a statement based on the accurate reports from Germany, as follows: The Tventri radio station repeatedly claimed that the British Air Force's attack on Belgium and northern France was the largest air raid in the history of war. In particular, the number of aircraft dispatched by the British aircraft in the air raid on the area on the 25th exceeded the number of aircraft dispatched by the German Air Force in its most fierce night raid. This statement obviously wants to make the world, especially the United States, believe that Britain is taking offensive action to rescue the Soviet Union. According to the actual situation at the time, the first batch of British aircraft carried out an air raid from 12:24 pm to 4:50 pm on June 25, with a total of 12 Blenheim aircraft, covered by 50 Spitfires. The second batch of British aircraft raided the area from 4:30 pm to 4:50 pm, with a total of 15 Blenheim aircraft and 60 Spitfires. The statement by Tventri radio station that the British planes lost a total of six planes in the two air raids does not match the facts. The actual loss of British planes was 24 Spitfires and 2 Blenheim aircraft, of which 21 Spitfires were shot down by German destroyers, and the rest were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The German aircraft only lost three. In the two air raids by British aircraft, no military targets were damaged. Civilians suffered slight casualties, and several houses were destroyed. The British's exaggerated propaganda about the air force offensive is ridiculous. In fact, the number of aircraft dispatched by German aircraft groups in the air raids on the three islands of Britain often exceeded the number of British aircraft mentioned above by five times.</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Meets with Swedish Envoy, Expresses Serious Views on Allowing German Troops to Pass Through</h3>
<p>London, June 28 (Reuters) - Foreign Secretary Eden met with Swedish envoy Prytz at the Foreign Office yesterday afternoon, and said that the British government holds very serious views on the Swedish government allowing a German division to pass through on its way to the Soviet front.</p>
<p>London, June 28 (Reuters) - According to a correspondent from the Free French News Agency in the Swedish capital, Germany's urgent request for Sweden to allow its army to pass through is due to (1) Finland's hesitation, (2) Germany's lack of transport ships, and (3) both sides having installed hydro-electric power in the Baltic Sea, making navigation very dangerous. According to a Swedish government spokesman, it will take about two days for the German troops to pass through Swedish territory.</p>
<h3>Rumor That Germany Asks Turkey for Passage, Unable to Verify</h3>
<p>London, June 28 (Reuters) - Reuters diplomatic correspondent says that it is rumored that German Ambassador to Turkey Papen has proposed to Turkey that German troops pass through Turkey to attack the British army in Syria. In any case, informed sources in London have been unable to verify this.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Warns Turkey, Time to Recognize Friend and Foe</h3>
<p>Moscow, June 28 (TASS) - When Kemal led the Turkish people in their struggle for survival, the Soviet Union began a friendly relationship with Turkey. Three days after the establishment of the National Assembly on April 11, 1920, Kemal sent a telegram to the Soviet government requesting assistance. Since then, whenever Turkey has encountered difficulties, the Soviet Union has always provided assistance with a disinterested attitude. At the Lausanne Conference in 1922 and 1923, Turkey requested the straits, and the Soviet Union again provided various assistance. The Soviet Union also took the same position at the Montreux Conference in 1936. Most recently, after the German fascist robber army occupied the islands at the entrance of the straits, the Soviet Union also assured Turkey that it would abide by neutrality. All of this is well known to the world. In order to undermine the friendly relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey, Hitler spread rumors, falsely claiming that the Soviet Union requested to occupy Istanbul and the Bosphorus Strait. It is not surprising that such nonsense comes from Hitler, but it is puzzling that Turkish newspapers published it. Regarding this matter, Molotov reiterated the Soviet Union's position on the 22nd. It is time for Turkish newspapers to distinguish between friend and foe.</p>
<h3>British Army's Attack on Syria Continues to Progress, German Planes Bomb Damascus</h3>
<p>Jerusalem, June 28 (Reuters) - The allied forces attacking from Damascus are advancing rapidly and have reached Nibeck, 35 miles northeast of Damascus, halfway between the city and the important center of Homs. The allied forces on the west side of the Homs highway, who attacked Sayyidnaya yesterday, have now broken through the area and are continuing to advance, but are encountering resistance from the Vichy army. At the same time, the main force of the British Empire army advancing along the coast has advanced four miles and has reached Wadi al-Kharrar (dried-up riverbed) north of Qasouba, no more than fifteen miles from Beirut, and has sent troops to launch an offensive patrol inland. The British Navy is currently shelling the French front lines at Damour, halfway between Sidon and Beirut.</p>
<p>Damascus, June 28 (Reuters) - On Wednesday last week, German planes bombed the Syrian capital Damascus, killing 70 people, injuring 29, and destroying more than 100 houses. Bombs fell within ten yards of the famous Umayyad Mosque and the tomb of Saladin, and the windows and walls were shattered. After investigation, French military officials determined that the bombs were dropped by German planes.</p>
<h3>Vichy Officials Fly to Ankara, Entrusted with Two Missions</h3>
<p>London, June 28 (Reuters) - The Independent French News Agency's Istanbul correspondent reported that Médecin, the assistant to Vichy State Minister Darlan, has recently flown to Ankara. It is believed that Médecin is carrying a letter from General Pétain to Turkish President Inonu. It is reported that this mission has two purposes: (1) to negotiate the route for the Vichy army to withdraw from Syria into Turkey, and (2) to dispel Turkey's negative impressions of Darlan's recent speech. The question of the Franco-Turkish alliance, which still exists in principle, may also be discussed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa Visits Soviet Foreign Minister</h3>

<h3>Romanian Oil Field on Fire Due to Technical Error</h3>
<p>Budapest, June 28 (United Press) - Yesterday, a fire broke out in the oil depot of Romania's Badr Oil Company due to a technical error. Although it was extinguished by firefighters, it suffered losses.</p>
<h3>U.S. President and Congressmen Discuss Aid to Southern Ireland</h3>
<p>Hyde Park, June 28 (Reuters) - President Roosevelt discussed the issue of how to aid Ireland with four congressmen related to Southern Ireland here yesterday. Ireland has chartered three ships to transport food worth 500,000 yuan, but President Roosevelt did not inform the congressmen that the three ships had already sailed. As for the American rifles without ammunition, it is still unknown whether it will help Ireland. The President claimed that the existing factories for manufacturing ordnance are sufficient, but factories for manufacturing ammunition still need to be added.</p>
<h3>Dutch Armory Explodes</h3>
<p>London, June 28 (United Press) - Yesterday, a Dutch newspaper here said that a large armory in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, had been destroyed, and many bombs were stored in it. During the six hours of the explosion, the sound of exploding bombs could be heard hundreds of times, and windows and doors within six miles were shaken. The newspaper also said that many Dutch and German people must have been killed.</p>

<h3>The Current Situation and Evolution of Ukraine</h3>
<p>The Ukrainian Republic, famous for its black soil belt and as the "Granary of Europe," is one of the three major parts of the European section of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>(Territory) To the north it borders the Belorussian Republic, to the east and northeast it borders the Russian mainland, and to the west it borders Poland—in 1939, it divided and seized eastern Poland with Germany, namely the area east of the Bug and San rivers, tributaries of the Vistula River—to the southwest it is bordered by Romania via the Dniester River, and to the south it faces the Black Sea, into which the famous Crimean Peninsula extends. Its</p>
<p>(Area) is 443,000 square kilometers, a large part of the European Plain, with an average elevation of around 100 meters above sea level. There are no high mountains, only winding and undulating small hills, none exceeding 150 meters above sea level.</p>
<p>(Major Rivers) There are four: the westernmost Dniester River, then eastward the Bug River, then the most famous Dnieper River, which conveniently divides Ukraine into two major parts, and the easternmost Donets River, a tributary of the Don River. The rivers all flow from northwest to southeast, except for the Dnieper River, which makes a bend, turning southwest halfway and entering the Black Sea.</p>
<p>(People) The population of Ukraine is 31.9 million, making it the most densely populated part of the Soviet Union. Its average density is 70 people per square kilometer, while the rest of the area only has 35 people per square kilometer. The ethnic group belongs to the Little Russian branch of the Slavic race. The so-called Little Russians are a general term for the steppe peoples of southern Soviet Union, relative to the Great Russians of the northern forest zone. But in reality, they are not short and small like people from a dwarf country, but taller than the Great Russians of the north. Their difference from the Great Russians is that their skulls are wider, their complexions are darker, and their hair color is also darker. Their temperament is also more cheerful and lively, full of imagination and artistry, and they easily show their true feelings.</p>
<p>(Resources) When it comes to the resources of Ukraine, it is no wonder that Nazi Germany coveted it, because it is the most agriculturally rich and industrially developed area. Its boundless fields, covered with a layer of fertile "black soil," are dotted with colorful and bright wildflowers in spring. Later, waves of wheat ripple, stretching to the horizon, interspersed with fields of beets and potatoes: it is truly a "granary" worthy of its name, feeding the people! Recently, cotton has been tried to be grown near the Black Sea in the south, and the results have been very good. Mineral resources are also very abundant, especially the iron reserves in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, which amount to 210 billion tons, making it one of the richest iron ore areas in the world. As for its industry, there is no need to mention anything else, but just think of the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station (Dniepropetrovsk) recently built near the city of Dniepropetrovsk (at the bend in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River), equipped with nine large generators, with a total power generation of 810,000 horsepower, which can supply electricity to factories within 200 kilometers around, and you can know how rapidly its industry is developing! There are steel factories, electrical factories, chemical factories, mechanical factories, ... in short, everything that should be there is there, originally the result of two five-year plans!</p>
<p>Famous Cities include Kharkov, located on the upper reaches of the Donets River, with a population of 833,000, and is the capital of the Ukrainian Republic. Industry is developed, and it is also a railway hub from Moscow to the Black Sea. Kiev is located on the right bank of the Dnieper River, with a population of 850,000, and was the capital of the old Kievan Rus', enjoying a long-standing reputation in religion and art, and is also the center of the agricultural area. Odessa has a population of 600,000, located on the northern shore of the Black Sea, with deep harbors and comprehensive facilities, serving as the southern gateway to the Soviet Union, and is famous for exporting wheat from the black soil belt.</p>
<p>Brief History The Ukrainian region was initially the homeland of the East Goths; after they were oppressed by the Huns and moved westward, the Slavs occupied this fertile land. We know very little about the earliest history of this nation; around the 5th and 6th centuries AD, a kingdom called Autes was established; however, it was destroyed by foreign invasions in the 7th century. In 862 AD, the Northern Barbarian chieftain Rurik from the Scandinavian Peninsula settled in what is now Novgorod, establishing a country, which is the origin of present-day Russia. He had a brother named Oleg, who occupied Kiev and established a country, which is the beginning of present-day Ukraine.</p>
<p>In the 10th century AD, the power of a certain auxiliary state greatly expanded, and a monarch named Vladimir (980-1015) converted to Christianity. During the reign of his son Taroslav, the territory and national strength increased even more, as if the sun was at its zenith. He also corresponded with envoys from various Western European countries, and one of his princesses even married King Henry I of France.</p>
<p>However, a country built on the grasslands, without natural barriers, is naturally vulnerable to foreign invasions. Sure enough, in the 12th century, Kiev was seized by a prince of northern Russia, and in the 13th century, it became a dependency of the Mongols. In 1340 AD, it came under Polish rule, and the name Ukraine originated from this time. By the early 17th century, when the Romanov dynasty became emperors of Russia, they began years of bloody battles with Poland to seize Kiev, just like the states of Jin and Chu in our Spring and Autumn period fought to the death for the state of Zheng. Then Turkey joined in, and Ukraine was vividly divided into three parts: western Ukraine under Poland, eastern Ukraine under Russia, and southern Ukraine under Turkey.</p>
<p>At this time, a patriotic hero named Mazeppa emerged, striving for the unification of Ukraine, the same romantic hero of the literary center who was sung and praised by the English poet Byron and the French poet Hugo. In 1687 AD, he became the leader of the adventurous Cossacks—meaning "uncivilized people"—and then contacted the Russians to get rid of the shackles of the Poles. For twenty years, he lived a luxurious and literary monarchical life in his city of Batoueime, which can truly be called a period of Kievan Renaissance. Many literary works were produced, full of Western colors and Latinized humanism. When the Russian Tsar Peter the Great truly wanted to take Ukraine for himself, Mazeppa turned north and cooperated with the famous Swedish King Charles XII, who was then competing with Peter the Great. Charles XII also formally recognized Ukraine as an independent country, and he even went deep into enemy territory alone to help him. Unfortunately, in the famous Battle of Poltava in 1709 AD, Charles XII's army was completely defeated, and Mazeppa also fled to Turkey, where he ended his life in decline. Eastern Ukraine fell into the hands of Russia again.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 19th century, the national consciousness of Ukraine revived: it initially took the form of literature, producing folk songs, epics, etc., all full of patriotic sentiments. But the St. Petersburg government naturally tried its best to suppress it and never recognized their demands as legitimate.</p>
<p>(Current Situation) When the First European War broke out, Russia also experienced a social revolution in 1917. Ukraine took the opportunity to declare independence in December and convened a national assembly. In the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Russia and Germany in 1918, there was a clause recognizing its independence. But later, it became the main base for the White Russians to resist the Red Russians: the White Russians ultimately failed, and Ukraine was re-entered under the rule of the Moscow government. In 1922 AD, the Soviet Russian Federation was established, and Ukraine became one of the federated states and joined the Moscow group political system. However, Ukraine has its own unique language, and now Ukrainian has been completely adopted as the common language in all Ukrainian schools, armies, and political institutions. There is also something that outsiders do not understand much: that is, although Soviet Russia overthrew religion and promoted atheism, the Ukrainians are full of the spirit of religious revival; they not only want to revive the Eastern Orthodox Church, but also have great hopes of reconciling with the old Roman Pope in order to return to the old Catholic Church. Now it is encountering a serious dangerous stage again, who knows what its future fate will be?

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Plans to Provide Relief to Students from Ningbo and Shaoxing Who Have Lost Their Schooling; Has Requested the Central Government to Establish Two Middle Schools</h3>
<p>(Lishui Correspondent) How to provide relief to students from Ningbo and Shaoxing who have lost their schooling due to the fall of those areas is currently the most serious issue in Zhejiang Province's education sector. A reporter from Shenjiang News visited Xu Shaodi, the Director of the Education Department, to inquire about everything. According to reports, the Education Department is actively planning to provide relief to students from Ningbo and Shaoxing who have lost their schooling. This decision was made after the Japanese army captured Ningbo and Shaoxing, and four schools, including the Provincial Shaoxing Middle School, the Provisional Fourth Middle School of Western Zhejiang in Yuyao, the Ningbo Vocational High School of Technology, and the Sericulture School, were withdrawn from the war zone. Due to budget cuts, it was decided to temporarily suspend operations. Private schools in the counties have been relocated after repeated migrations, and there are still 19 schools that have been unable to withdraw. A few schools have withdrawn a small number of students to safer places and are struggling to support themselves and find ways to resume classes. However, based on their current situation and environment, it is feared that they will not be able to sustain this for long. It is estimated that there are a total of 23 secondary schools in the Ningbo and Shaoxing war zone, with a total of more than 8,000 students. A total of 1,099 students are expected to graduate this semester, and 7,320 have not yet graduated. Graduates either continue their education or find employment depending on their environment, abilities, and the subjects they have studied. At least 7,000 students should continue their studies in schools next semester. Among these 7,000 students, in addition to a portion who temporarily drop out of school due to social, family, environmental, or personal abilities and courage, a portion transfer to other schools in the rear to study, and a portion may continue their studies in schools in the war zone, it is planned to temporarily count 3,000 who are waiting for the government to establish new schools to accommodate and provide relief. It is planned to request the Central Government to establish a national middle school in Zhejiang, and to allocate 1,500 Ningbo and Shaoxing students each to the temporary middle schools designated by Zhejiang Province to handle the relocation of faculty and staff from Shanghai. The former has not yet been approved by the Central Government, while the latter has been submitted by the Ministry of Education to the Executive Yuan for approval. As for the future location of the national middle school, it is planned to be located at the junction of Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, with special funding from Jiangxi rice. The entire school will temporarily open 30 classes, in addition to high school and junior high school classes, vocational and normal school departments will also be set up when necessary. The temporary middle schools are planned to be located in Changshan, Kaihua in the Quzhou area, and Suian in the Yanzhou area, and branch schools are planned to be established in Jinyun, Yongkang, and other places based on actual needs, with a planned 53 classes (12 high school classes, 24 junior high school classes, 6 simple normal school classes, and 11 vocational classes), so that students from high school, junior high school, normal school, agriculture, industry, and commerce in Ningbo and Shaoxing will all have the opportunity to receive education.</p>

<h3>Yarn Flowers The Cotton Yarn Market Surge Becomes More Intense, Nearing the 1,600 Yuan Mark, Afternoon Gray Market Already Breaks 1,600 Yuan Mark, Major Change Imminent Without Mitigation Measures, Our Newspaper Responds to a Reader's Inquiry</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the surge is intensifying. This is because Hong Kong merchants continue their relentless sales efforts. Today, another 1,755 bales were shipped there. In addition, there is a shortage of some 20-count yarns, and purchasing is inconvenient. Therefore, these merchants prefer to handle "Double Horse" brand yarns, which are readily available. As a result, transactions for "Double Horse" mill orders continue unabated. At the same time, raw material prices are rising daily. All these factors contribute to the stability of the yarn market. However, the amount of short selling is very large. Sellers, seeing the above situation, find it difficult to resist. "Double Horse" mill orders are gradually being reduced to within 20,000 bales. Secondly, demand from the South remains strong. The price of 1,585 yuan on May 3rd has already been surpassed. In this environment, short sellers have a weak line of defense and can only painfully cover their positions. The market then quickly rises. Market rumors abound, saying that a certain large trader went bankrupt, with short positions of about 4,000 bales or more, and is now in the same situation. However, they are fortunately in a better position. For the past six months, they have been making money on short positions, so their financial strength is quite strong, and they have sufficient backing. However, considering the current situation, they are adopting a "knowing when to adapt is the mark of a wise person" strategy and are taking the opportunity to switch from short to long, accumulating a quantity of 6,000 to 7,000 bales. The market is closed this afternoon due to the weekend, but some say that informal trading in the stock exchange building has already reached 1,620 yuan. In this situation, short sellers are panicking. In short, the recent rise in prices of both American and Indian cotton and the increase in raw material costs are a major blow to short sellers. The future of the yarn market is undergoing a transformation.</p>
<p>"Double Horse" opened this morning because it was heard that a certain yarn company had gone bankrupt late at night, freeing up about 4,000 bales. Therefore, many short sellers rushed to cover their positions. The opening price was 1,575 yuan, rising directly to 1,587 yuan, surpassing the high price of 1,585 yuan on the 3rd of last month. Then it was heard that the current yarn Hong Kong merchants still had a healthy appetite, and confidence was stronger, rising to 1,594 yuan. However, some came back to short sell, falling back to 1,577 yuan. Until after 12 o'clock, a certain large short seller significantly increased their long positions, rising again to 1,585 yuan at the close. The total trading volume for the half-day was 14,200 bales. The amounts bought by various merchant groups are listed on the left:</p>
<p>The market situation for "Golden Double Horse" brand yarn is trending upward, with active trading and short covering. As a result, the July contract rose by 5 yuan, and the August contract rose by 3.5 yuan. The trading volume was 8,000 bales. The high, low, and closing prices for the half-day are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Someone wrote to our newspaper, listing our cotton yarn news from the 12th to the 26th of this month, saying that it was "either promoting the long side or advocating for the short side, reversing fortunes and doing everything possible to manipulate the market. I truly don't know what journalistic ethics are, which is truly regrettable." The letter also stated that our newspaper "fabricates news, such as yesterday's (26th) report that the amount of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong in the past ten days was about 10,000 bales or more. If you check the price list in your newspaper from June 16th to June 27th, the number of spot yarn transactions listed each day that belong to Hong Kong merchants is only 3,510 bales, while those belonging to speculative transactions among peers reach as many as 24,630 bales. I also don't know what the value of the news is. At a time when prices are soaring and people are suffering, why continue to add fuel to the fire? I believe this is not something that you, sir, would be happy to do." The above is the main point of the letter writer's argument. Although they did not request a response in the newspaper, our newspaper has a fair stance and is never afraid of public opinion. We have our own stance on right and wrong, so we are willing to reveal it for the public to judge.</p>
<p>The editor hereby responds to the letter writer. Since you know that "news values objective reporting and should not be subjective propaganda," you should not rashly accuse us of this. Because there is a trend of rising prices in the market, we believe that prices will go up, which is not "promoting the long side." If there are signs of a decline in the market, we believe that prices will go down, which is not "advocating for the short side." We are completely "objectively" "reporting" and have never "subjectively" "propagandized." Only those engaged in cotton yarn speculation, who hope for prices to rise when they buy and hope for prices to fall when they sell, have subjective prejudices. Once there is a prejudice, any fair reporting or observation of the overall trend will be seen as wrong. What aligns with my intentions is considered right, and what goes against my intentions is considered wrong. Since right and wrong are not clear, their opinions on what is reasonable or not are not worth considering.</p>
<p>As for saying that the cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong is about 10,000 bales or more, and that according to the price list, the number of spot yarn transactions by Hong Kong merchants is only 3,500 bales, and therefore "I don't know what the value of the news is," this is truly blind and absurd. The editor does not need to blame himself, but rather blames the letter writer for reading the newspaper too carelessly and writing too hastily. You should know that according to our newspaper's on-site investigation, the amount of cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong and other places is indeed about 10,000 bales. As for the details, there is no need to announce them. As long as the letter writer seeks them calmly, it will not be difficult to find them. If the facts are not clear, and you resort to scolding, even if you are too angry, you should not vent it on our newspaper. It would be fortunate if you could cultivate your temper.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is extremely firm. Generally, those holding goods are unwilling to show samples. Everyone seems to be treating it as a national treasure. This is because the spot price of "Double Horse" brand yarn has suddenly increased significantly, and factories are unwilling to accept it. In addition, overseas cotton markets are rising daily. The price in Shanghai is relatively cheaper, so cotton merchants' goals are not being achieved, but they are unwilling to give up easily. Prices for both coarse and fine raw cotton have risen by another three to five yuan. The opening prices are listed on the left, totaling 1,514 bales, with prices rising by three to five yuan.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose due to purchases by speculators and Wall Street. At the same time, it was also boosted by the firm opposition of the parliament against maximum cotton cloth price limits. Yesterday's closing price was 27-28 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to purchases by speculators, then fell slightly due to sales by European exporters. Finally, it actively rose again due to short covering. As a result, the closing prices rose by one to six rupees each. It is also predicted that today's opening market will be bullish by three to four rupees.</p>
<p>The order transactions for foreign cotton in Shanghai are firm and rising due to the further increase in prices of American and Indian cotton and the good situation of spot yarn. All parties are quite enthusiastic about purchasing. Yesterday, both Chinese and foreign cotton spinning mills purchased more than 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton. At the same time, cotton brokers also had transactions in Indian cotton.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Cotton Yarn Rises Sharply, Spot Cotton Cloth Rises Even Higher</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth Yesterday's market continued the trend of rising prices. This was due to the sharp rise in speculative yarn and cloth prices, which aroused hoarding intentions. Demand for futures was also strong. White goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill cloth each rose by 2.5 to 5 jiao per bolt. Dyed cloth also rose by another 5 jiao per bolt. Trading on this street was particularly active, totaling more than 500 pieces. Of these, futures for twill velvet, French velvet, and corduroy accounted for half. Merchants from Guangdong and Guangxi purchased more than 100 pieces of blue cloth and khaki twill. Merchants from Siam and Singapore purchased more than 5,000 bolts of various bleached and dyed cloths. Today, 550 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth Yesterday, due to the soaring price of "Double Horse" brand yarn, people inside and outside the industry became more confident, and demand continued to be strong. Because the exchange's futures market had no trading volume, the spot market was only open for half a day on Saturday, but the surge was particularly strong. High-end fine cloth from the "Dragon Head" brand was sold for 49.4 yuan. The noon closing price was slightly lower at 49.05 yuan. Other mid- and low-end fine cloths each rose by 5 to 7.5 jiao. Colored cloth "Four Gentlemen" drill once rose to 1.62 yuan in the morning, and closed at 1.615 yuan. The spot bank orders opened at 1.5825 yuan. It is said that the consolidated tax will be increased starting next month, so spot demand from customers is expected to be strong.</p>
<h3>Finance Japanese Merchants Selling, Foreign Exchange Eases</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC listed exchange rates did not change, and the gray market exchange rates for British and American currencies tended to ease. The Chinese and foreign firms were willing to sell American dollars at 5.375 yuan. Sales of imports remained minimal, and it was heard that gold prices had rebounded and then fallen back, and there were fears of a conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan. There were also rumors that Fox advocated raising the American dollar to 5.5 yuan. Japanese banks supplied for sale, and speculators also came to throw and sell, also selling August new trades at 5.4375 yuan. The market trend was easing. At the close of the market, the British exchange rate also appeared to be hardening. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday, and half-day trading was quite active.</p>
<p>The August contract has already been opened.</p>
<p>Since the morning, the foreign telegrams reported that the silver market in Britain, America, and India was unchanged. The exchange rate of the British pound against Shanghai alone contracted by 0.03125, and the rest were flat. The central government's listed exchange rates did not move. At the opening of the domestic market, banks were willing to sell, the spot exchange rate of the British pound was 3 pence 2.96875, and the American dollar was 5.375 yuan. Import firms came to buy the June British pound at 5.375 yuan, and importers also captured it in the same month at the same price. The HSBC listed exchange rates were all flat.

<h3>The US Exchange Rate May Increase and Lengthen, The Gold Market Reverses and Falls Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market in the gray market first rose slightly and then suddenly reversed and fell. The price once collapsed to within the 6,400 yuan mark. The hearts of all parties were stimulated by this wind and turned to fatigue. The equalization fund and American Fox advocated increasing and lengthening the Shanghai American exchange rate to 5.5 yuan, and there were rumors that the Soviet Union and Japan might have a war, so the foreign exchange rate hardened. In addition, the silver and gold banks sold and, at noon, sharply retreated from 6,435 yuan to 6,385 yuan. The securities firms' constant efforts to push it up raised it to outside 6,400 yuan, and it still squeezed a small 17 yuan. Half-day trading totaled more than 20,000 taels. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday. Swap (June to July) seller Wing On posted to Yuh Cheung Wing 30 taels, the price was 60 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan. Cash also dropped. Cheung Wo sold 50 taels to Seng Kee for about 6,430 yuan in the futures exchange, and the price was 300 yuan higher. The later futures exchange fell back, so there were buyers at 320 yuan higher, a squeeze of ten yuan. Decorative gold, Customs gold, etc. remained flat.</p>
<p>Futures Want to Rise but Fall</p>

Yat Tai, Chick Tai, Seng Kee, and Lai made efforts to push it up and lingered at 6,430 yuan for a long time, once raising it to 6,435 yuan, and then only rising and falling by a few yuan. It was not until 10:45 that fatigue began to show. The foreign exchange rate reported easing, and unfavorable rumors also arose. Heng Kee, Hop Shing, Tak Tai, Ting Shing, and Yan Shing Wing successively sold forcefully, and floating longs were cut off, and the price gradually decreased by more than 40 yuan, falling into the inside of 6,400 yuan, seeing 6,385 yuan. Securities firms Yat Tai and Tak Foo rose up again to absorb it, and Heng Kee also came to reinvest, and then rebounded by 20 yuan, reaching 6,405 yuan. At noon, the market closed at 6,404 yuan, which was 17 yuan lower than the previous day. According to the July American dollar settlement price of 5.40625 yuan, it was 6,442 yuan, and the squeeze was 38 yuan. After the close, it was flat. There was a difference of 50 yuan that day. In the afternoon, there was no market. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was 330 yuan higher than the hot red futures exchange price, and the buy-in was 70 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current marked gold.</p>
<p>Decorative Gold Stagnant and Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops is still listed at 695 yuan by Tai Tung Hang and Sin Tung Hang, with a reduction of 40 yuan for buy-ins.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Also Slightly Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The gray market price first rose and then fell, and the spot also tended to soften at the same time, so the British American gold pound also dropped by 1 yuan. The British gold bill remained unchanged, and the market price stood flat. The American dollar bill opened at 4.2 fen, and rose to 8.5 fen after opening, and then suddenly retreated to 3.5 fen, and finally closed at 18.37 yuan, a squeeze of 5 fen lower than the previous day. The spot still needs to be reduced by 0.27-0.28 yuan. The trend of the Hong Kong bill was stable, and the Japanese gold bill was slightly softened, and the evening market retreated to 1.855 yuan. The trend of the Korean bill was stable, and the market price stood flat. The evening market was 1.57 yuan.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Acceptance Business</h3>
<p>Since its establishment in March 1936, the Bank Note Acceptance Institute of the Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry in Shanghai has handled the acceptance of notes between colleagues, regulated finance, and its business has been relatively developed. Last year, the city's banking conditions were loose, and the acceptance business decreased accordingly. Recently, there has been an influx of idle funds, and acceptance matters have virtually stagnated. In order to reduce expenses, the institute decided to temporarily suspend the acceptance business and yesterday sent a circular to all member banks to abolish the acceptance agreement. All acceptance funds previously paid by the member banks to the institute will be returned before the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Food Hong Kong Rice Has a Huge Amount Waiting to Be Sold Speculation Is Difficult to Move, The Market Gradually Stabilizes Hong Kong Rice Arrived in Two Batches Yesterday, The Number Was Not Small</h3>
<p>The Yang Rice Market Situation Still Has Mixed Ups and Downs, Forming a Circling Pattern. In the Early Market, Both Customers and Hoarders Were Weak, and Floating Longs Cashed in Profits. The Mainland Merchant Group Had Not Shipped Out Their Previous Orders, and New Transactions Were Waiting and Not Moving Forward. Since There Were Many Stocks and Arrivals, and the Publicly Sold Hong Kong Rice Also Had a Huge Amount Waiting to Be Sold, The Opening Price Immediately Moved Downstream. Both Futures and Spot Rice Once Fell Outside 1 Yuan to 2 Yuan. Then, Since The Price Was Small, It Attracted The Ningbo Merchant Group to Increase Purchases, and They Purchased No Less Than 5,000 Bags of Futures and Spot. The Street's Retail Investors Also Took Advantage of the Flat Price to Absorb. The Market Was Tired and Rebounded. However, The Overall Market Was Still Relatively Flat Throughout the Day. General Wind-Stirring People Couldn't Do the Work of Snatching Hats and Kicking the Ball. The Total Spot Transaction Was Only More Than 7,000 Bags. The British-Chinese Company Original Bags Were Also Only 500-600 Tons. As a Result, The Market Saw a Small Turn of About 1 Yuan. The British-Chinese Company Broken Rice Has Little Trading in Both Spot and Future, July From 115 Yuan to 114 Yuan, No. 2 Rice Previously Opened at 141-2 Yuan, Yesterday Only 140.05 Yuan and 140 Yuan, The Small Twist Spot Both 149 Yuan to 148.5 Yuan, No. 1 Saigon Also Hasn't Opened, Spot Prices All Sell Less Than 1 Yuan, The Closing Market Forms a Fixed Trend.</p>
<p>For Thick and Thin Geng Chinese Rice, The Supply and Demand Were Similar Yesterday. All Prices Kept Their Original Plates Without Honor or Disgrace. Guai Kai South Harbor Fresh Early and Late Rice Was 137 Yuan to 134 Yuan, Zhongguan Original Bag 135 Yuan, Wuxi Original Bag Overnight Geng Was 131 Yuan to 130 Yuan.</p>
<p>The Demand for Sticky Rice Turned Clear, and Transactions Were Particularly Sparse. Although Xiang Yuan White Had Limited Market Goods, The Selling Price Was Difficult to Support and Was Reduced by Nearly 1 Yuan. Kai Hong Kong Gao Yuan White Was 122.5 Yuan and 122 Yuan, Zhong Jue Was 117-8 Yuan, Nuo Lu Was 112.5 Yuan Jue to 106 Yuan. After The Price of Chinese Sticky Rice Was Thoroughly Depreciated, There Were Quite a Few Retailers Asking About It, and The Cargo Owners Were Unwilling to Lightly Dispose of It Again, So The Market Had No Change. Ordinary Goods Continued to Open at About 120 Yuan, But High-Priced Goods Still Needed 123-4 Yuan.</p>
<p>A Large Batch of Foreign Rice Arrived at the Port on Anshun Ship of Taikoo Company Yesterday Afternoon, With 28,792 Bags of Foreign Rice From Hong Kong. Among Them, 12,314 Bags Were Low-Priced Rice From the Public Works Department, and The Rest Were Passenger Goods. The Ship Was Moored at the Company's Pier on the Bund of the French Concession, and Began Unloading Overnight Yesterday. The Company's Taiyuan Ship Has Also Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Evening, and Also Has Foreign Rice Loaded. The Exact Number Needs to Be Ascertained and Reported on Monday. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Foreign Vermicelli Arrives Continuously</h3>
<p>The Current Foreign Vermicelli Market Situation, After Once Rising Slightly The Day Before Yesterday, Has Become More Uncertain. Recently, Goods Have Been Transferred From Hong Kong and Arrivals Have Been Continuous. The Two Reports of This Newspaper Reported 20,300 Bags of Bell Tower Flower and Bird Brands Newly Arrived on The Hanyang Ship, and They Are Being Unloaded. It Is Heard That The Taiyuan Ship Will Still Load 37,000 Bags in Early Next Week. Amidst The Sound of Continuous Arrivals, Hoarders Are Holding Back. But Future Orders Will Ultimately Be Unprofitable, and The Sale of Low-Priced Vermicelli Will Soon Stop, So People's Hearts Are Still Difficult to See Small. The Market Is Calmly Opening Jinlong Vermicelli at 32.25 Yuan to 2 Jiao, And Shuangying Vermicelli at 32.05 Yuan. The Asking Price for Bastion Vermicelli and Chain Tower Vermicelli Is 33 Yuan, But There Are No Buyers. The Market Is Still Brewing.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake Oil Cake Actual Sales Are Both Weak</h3>
<p>Actual Sales of Cooking Oil Turned Slack and Weak Again, and People's Hearts Returned to Being Languid. Yesterday, Scattered Hoarders Sold 30 Barrels of Qingdao Raw Oil, The Price Was 175 Yuan, and Nearly 1,000 Dan of Clear Oil From The Dayou Factory Were Delivered in July, The Price Was 120 Yuan to 119 Yuan, Which Was About 1 Yuan Lower Than Before.</p>
<p>The Corn Market Was Flat After a Rise Yesterday. It Initially Rose More Than 0.5 Yuan Because the Hangzhou Merchant Group Continued to Purchase. Then The Hoarders Dao Gao Qun Xiang Came Out of the Cage and Low, and the Result Was Similar to the Previous Phase. A Total of More Than 2,000 Bags of Saigon and Helan Corn Were Sold (The Price Details Are in the Market Price ).</p>
<p>The Sales of Soybean Cake Are Still Not Fresh. Yesterday's Market Had Multiple Attempts to Maintain, But It Was Not Successful, And It Turned Downstream Again, And The Final Lower Than the Previous Squeeze of 23 Jiao. A Total of 40,000 Pieces of Shenji Soybean Cake Were Sold (The Price Details Are in the Market Price Column).</p>
<p>Today, 350 Bags of Soybeans, 12,500 Pieces of Soybean Cake, and 300 Bags of Raw Peanuts Are All Shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Securities Long Public Bonds Cash in Profits</h3>
<p>The Gray Market of Public Bonds First Rose and Then Fell Yesterday. On The One Hand, New Hoists Were Weak, And On The Other Hand, Old Longs Gradually Came Out of the Cage. The North Merchant Group Has Been Selling for Several Days. The General People in The Market All Say That the Long Side Coming Out Is to Rescue the Short Side so that They Can Hedge, and Otherwise They Will Have No Chance to Hedge. This Kind of Statement Is Completely a Chapter of Long Side, A Kind of Appearance of Strong Color and Internal Weakness, Which Is Invisibly Revealed. According to The Basic Mind of Doing Traders, They All Want to Profit. Yesterday's Market Turned Weak Because the Long Side Was Too Crowded, and Investors Couldn't Get One in a Hundred. So Once There Was a Little Shaking, They All Wanted to Find a Way to Escape. They Were Sincerely Afraid That a Large Number Would Come Out of the Cage, And the Short Side Would Take Advantage of It. Therefore, They Made This Clever Remark to Induce the Short Side's Hedge. The Long Side Then Gets to Sell and Profit. Moreover, Most of Them Are Now Spot Entries and Exits. Occasionally, There Are Those Who Borrow Goods to Deliver, But the Number Is Still a Small Number. Therefore, The Trend of Mu Bian Is Tired, Which Is Completely the Long Side Coming Out, Which Has Absolutely Nothing to Do With the Rumors. As in Yesterday's Market, Yitai First Raised the Price, And Type C Opened at 3.4 Yuan, And Tung Hong Sold Immediately. Hongda Also Came Out of the Cage, and The 3 Yuan Form Was Broken. New Hong and Xin Chang Came to Buy Again, And The North Merchant Group Suichang and Renfeng Came Out of the Cage Again. Therefore, The Market Was High and Low. Although the Long Side Wanted to Try Their Best to Hoist, They Couldn't Unite, So the Result Was Still Tired and Fell by 1-3 Jiao. The Transaction Was About 1 Million Yuan. The Simplified Table Is Listed Below.</p>
<p>The English Merchant Xue Nawang Rubber Co., Ltd., Managed by Huitong Foreign Bank, Is Scheduled to Hold the 21st Shareholders' Meeting on July 11th.

<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Slightly Recovers</h3>
<p>The Trend of Yesterday's Sugar Market Was Due to Hoarders Absorbing at Low Prices and Experts Selling, Resulting in A Recovery of 0.5 Jiao. The Guild's Planned Plate: 24 Coarse White Spot Foreign Warehouse: March Arrivals 88 Yuan, April Arrivals 88.3 Yuan, May Arrivals 89.3 Yuan to 89 Yuan, June Arrivals 90.04 Yuan, Specifying June 23 Arrival 90.05 Yuan, Dutch Red NT Mark 68.5 Yuan, Taikoo Car White B Mark 106.04 Yuan, Transshipment Cargo 89.1 Yuan, HX Mark East Warehouse 88 Yuan, H Mark Car Red 67 Yuan,</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Silk Is Severely Controlled</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Overseas Silk Market Had Mixed Ups and Downs Compared to The Previous Day. This City's Silk Market Has Suffered More Severe Control in Recent Days, and All Transactions Have Been Suspended. Because The Inspection Bureau Has Now Stopped Inspecting Various Raw Silks (That Is, No Export License Is Given), Only China Silk Company Is an Exception. In This Case, All Raw Silks in Shanghai Cannot Be Exported. The Various Foreign Zhuang Silk Companies Will Also Not Buy Raw Silks Without Export Licenses in The Future. Therefore, the Silk Industry Has Reached A Dead End.</p>
<h3>Coal Bituminous Coal Sales Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Bituminous Coal Business Has Been Calm and Not Very Exciting in Recent Days. Because the Price Has Increased, Although the Seller's Mind Is Firm, the Sales Market Is Stagnant, and the Sales Market Is Not Vibrant, Which Is Extremely Natural. The Market Is Again in a State of Hesitation. Yesterday, Indian Bituminous Coal Opened, With Colleagues Disassembling, and Warehouse Goods Were 428 Yuan, The Row Gang Was Added On. It Was Heard That Only 500 Tons Were Traded Yesterday.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials Medicinal Jian Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, Medicinal Jian Has No Continued Arrivals, and Both the Market's Principal Cargo and Hand Cargo Are Very Scarce, So the Market Continues to Exhibit an Upward Exhibition. Such As Bai Pi Jian叉 Rose 20 Yuan, and Was Sold to 220 Yuan. Hong Pi Jian Was Cheaper, and Was Sold for 160-170 Yuan.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth Woolen Cloth Summer Sales Are Not Weak</h3>
<p>Woolen Cloth Category Sales Are Not Weak. The Padding Is Mostly Autumn and Winter Goods. Original Box Transactions Are Plentiful. The Actual Sales Required by Users Are Mostly Palis Van Er Ding, Feather Yarn, Pane Bié Qu, Scholkus Ding Liwei, White Serge, White Zhigong, True and False Hemp Plastic Cloth, White Canvas Yellow Twill, Etc. Although There Are Many Scattered Transactions, Those Who Go Through It Are Quite Strong. The Customers With Purchasing Power, For Western Clothing Making, Are More Than When They Didn't Meet the Extra Sixth Month in Previous Years.</p>
<h3>A Visit to You Sheng Rainproof Cloth Weaving and Manufacturing</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhifeng</p>
<p>Rainproof cloth is a new invention of recent years. It is a qualified material for making raincoats. Its quality is as light as Bevillein, and its price is much cheaper than imported goods. Since the year of Geng, its sales have become more popular and spread to various ports in Southeast Asia. There are three operators: "Shanghai Raincoat Factory", "China Underwear Company" and "You Sheng Textile Factory". However, China Underwear Company and Shanghai Raincoat Factory do not sell raw materials, but sell raincoats made in factories, while You Sheng Factory produces in large quantities and specializes in wholesale of current and fixed orders without retail sales. Most of the gold brand goods circulating in the market today, which are bought and sold by the merchants, are made by You Sheng. I am in the woolen cloth business and have dealings with the merchants. In order to maintain my own reputation, I always pay close attention to the quality of the wool and cotton goods I sell. Therefore, I also wanted to know the content of rainproof cloth, and I had the intention to visit the You Sheng Factory. A few days ago, I drove to No. 31, Jixifei Road, West Shanghai (the distribution office is located at No. 288, Yunnan Road) to visit the factory. Manager Chen Ji welcomed and instructed me, and I learned that there were 120-30 looms, two-thirds of which were specialized in weaving rainproof cloth, and one-third were weaving other cloths. For the weaving of rainproof cloth, the warp and weft are all made of domestic high-quality singed yarn, and are woven with a special organization. After the raw materials enter the factory, they are first subjected to tensile tests and stem inspections, and then sent to the preparation room. After the preparation process of warping and wefting, they can be put on the machine for weaving. Because of the firmness and weight of the rainproof cloth, ordinary cloth machines cannot handle it, so the factory has special heavy-duty machines for weaving. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>German Purchases Stored in Shanghai: Rumors of Imminent Price Cuts; Value Exceeds US$1 Million; Positive Impact Expected on Local Economy</h3>
<p>Sources here predict that, following the outbreak of war between Germany and the Soviet Union, the large quantities of food and goods purchased and stored by German exporters in Shanghai, unable to be transported to Germany via the Trans-Siberian Railway as planned, must be disposed of. Therefore, prices are expected to plummet soon.</p>
<p>Urgent Need for Raw Materials and Food</p>
<p>Local business circles claim that, before the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, German interests commissioned Japanese and other neutral firms to make large-scale purchases in the East. Germany's need for raw materials and food has become increasingly urgent due to the continuation of the war. Therefore, German merchants are doing everything possible to acquire materials in Shanghai or Japan, with the intention of shipping them to Germany via Vladivostok using the Trans-Siberian Railway.</p>
<p>Immense Quantities of Goods Stockpiled in Shanghai</p>
<p>Reliable sources indicate that the goods purchased by German interests include coconut oil, tin, copper, rice, flour, nitrates, and tungsten, all stockpiled in Shanghai and unable to be shipped out. Regarding food, German interests have commissioned Japanese firms to purchase large quantities of Java sugar, which are currently stored in warehouses throughout the city. While German business circles often publicly boast that the large quantities of goods they have stored will not depreciate in value due to their inability to be transported to Germany, various parties believe that the prices of various materials stored by the Germans in Shanghai will fall sharply within a few weeks, and ultimately they will have to be sold off at reduced prices.</p>
<p>It is rumored that the recent decline in sugar prices in Shanghai is largely due to the large quantities of sugar stored by German interests, which have now begun to consider selling off at reduced prices. Well-informed sources say that if the Soviet-German war continues for a long period, German business circles will change their current optimism and decide to sell off their inventories as much as possible, which will inevitably lower prices. This will have a beneficial impact on the local economy, as the "dumping" of goods by German merchants will reduce prices, and the prices of other goods may also fall accordingly.</p>
<p>Agents Profited Handsomely</p>
<p>With the Siberian Railway, the only safe route for Shanghai-based German exporters to transport goods to Germany, now cut off, German trade and Germany's domestic economy have both suffered a major blow. The goods purchased here by German interests are considerable, and German merchants are eager to purchase the items they need, even if it means paying prices far higher than the market price. Therefore, local Chinese, Japanese, and neutral exporters have profited handsomely from acting as agents for Germany in purchasing goods. Some estimate that the goods currently stockpiled by German interests in Shanghai are worth more than US$1 million, while others estimate a far greater amount. The exact number is not yet available.</p>
<p>Shortage of German Goods; Market Prices Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Another repercussion of the Soviet-German war is that German firms, knowing that German products can no longer be shipped to Far Eastern markets, have raised the retail and wholesale prices of German goods such as pharmaceuticals, paints, dyes, machinery, and scientific instruments. Over the past several years, German goods have been sold widely in various ports and inland areas of China. In recent months, due to a shortage of ships sailing to the Far East, it has been difficult for China to obtain American machinery, so large quantities of machinery were purchased from Germany. Now the situation has changed, and in the coming days, the market prices of German goods in Shanghai will inevitably continue to rise to new highs.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Women and Children in the Dutch East Indies to be Evacuated to Japan; Asama Maru to Pass Through Shanghai on the 9th of Next Month; German and Italian Adult Males Detained by the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>The Japanese mail ship Asama Maru, chartered by the German government, carrying 400 German and Italian women and children evacuees, is sailing from Batavia, Dutch East Indies, to Kobe and is scheduled to pass through Shanghai on July 9. The Shanghai office of Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) received notification yesterday morning (the 28th) that the ship would call at Shanghai. It is reported that the majority of the women and children on board the Asama Maru are German, with the remainder being Italian. Their husbands and sons of military age have been detained by the authorities in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>All Will Disembark After Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>When the Asama Maru arrives in Shanghai, most of the German and Italian women and children will disembark. Only those with relatives and friends in Japan will continue to Kobe. It is not known whether the travel expenses of these women and children will be paid by themselves or by the German government. NYK officials also do not know what class of cabins they are traveling in. According to an official from the company, it is not yet certain whether tickets can be purchased in Shanghai to travel to Kobe on the Asama Maru and is awaiting notification. If tickets can be purchased, passengers arriving in Shanghai on the Asama Maru will transfer to the Tatsuta Maru to go to Japan. The Asama Maru was originally scheduled to pass through Shanghai on July 5 on its regular voyage to the United States, but it was suddenly announced that it would sail empty from Manila to Batavia to transport German and Italian women and children there.</p>
<h3>Tram Fare Increases Postponed</h3>
<p>The British-owned tram company of the Public Concession, using the excuse of foreign exchange tightening, disregarded the burden on the city's residents and obtained approval to increase fares again. Upon hearing the news, various parties expressed deep indignation. Due to public opinion pressure, the newly set prices, originally scheduled to take effect yesterday, have now been postponed. According to a notice issued yesterday by the company's manager, Mr. Ewen, the date of implementation of the new fare schedule will be announced later. The increase in monthly tickets is also still pending. In addition, the Shanghai Chinese Bus Company's request to increase fares is also still under consideration by the Municipal Council. Various parties hope that the authorities will handle it carefully and not easily approve it.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Plague Spreads to Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>After the plague in Ningbo recurred, it has not been completely eradicated. It is now known that cases have also been discovered in Guangze, Jiangxi Province. Fortunately, the local authorities have made every effort to prevent and control it, and it has not spread. In order to actively eliminate the plague atmosphere, the Central Health Administration recently selected several experts to go to Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi provinces to cooperate with the local authorities in prevention and control, and brought a large number of drugs to set up epidemic prevention institutions in various regions and intensify work.</p>
<h3>Fox Consults Shanghai on Financial Measures; Refuses to Announce Established Equalization Policy</h3>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Chongqing, Mr. Fox, the American member of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, and his assistant, Mr. Taylor, held meetings with the managers of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and HSBC, Citibank, and other banks, as well as various economic experts, to review the financial and monetary systems of Shanghai and the occupied areas, and the black market foreign exchange in Shanghai. The two gentlemen continued yesterday to have close discussions with the responsible persons of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and HSBC, and economic experts. They will prepare a detailed report based on their findings, with attached opinions, and submit it to the Equalization Fund Committee as a reference for determining fundamental policies. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday that although Mr. Fox's decision to come to Shanghai was to repeatedly discuss with the banking community, it was only in the nature of consulting and seeking opinions, and he himself refused to announce the established policy of the Equalization Fund. The only thing that can be said is that the legal exchange rate will be maintained at all times to consolidate currency confidence and benefit the legitimate trade of Chinese and foreign merchants throughout the country. Currently, the Equalization Fund allows importers to apply for foreign exchange at the official rate for import goods that are necessary for China's domestic needs, and does not allow them to apply for foreign exchange at the legal rate for goods transported to occupied areas, regardless of whether they are necessary or not. Although the Shanghai black market foreign exchange will continue to be maintained, goods transported to Shanghai may not apply for foreign exchange at the legal rate. As for the Equalization Fund's existing US$50 million in American loans to China, £5 million in British loans to China, and US$20 million in joint loans from Chinese national banks, it is exceptionally well-funded. Since Mr. Fox arrived in Shanghai, the exchange rates of the British pound and the US dollar in the Shanghai foreign exchange market have eased yesterday, and Japanese banks and speculators have successively sold off, and the value of the legal currency has invisibly increased.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales at Fixed Prices to be Discontinued Next Month; Comes to an End on July 2nd</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the people's food supply and suppress flour prices, the Municipal Council previously obtained the consent of the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills to hold flour sales at fixed prices from February of last year. At the end of November last year, it again requested each foreign flour import firm to request their designated customers to submit one-tenth of their orders for flour to be sold at fixed prices by the flour companies. The details of the process have been successively reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the 300,000 bags of flour at fixed prices that Fuxin Mill agreed to supply, as well as the foreign flour that has been drawn in recently, have been sold out since May 1 and will be sold out by June 26. Subsequently, the factory generously agreed to continue to supply 33,272 bags, so the flour sales at fixed prices could be extended to July 1 (flour will be issued as usual on July 1). It is now found that the total amount of foreign flour in stock in this city is more than 1 million bags. If it is not exported, it should be able to meet the needs of this port until the end of the year. Moreover, the rice market has become stable, and it is expected that there will be no drastic changes in the flour market thereafter. Therefore, the flour sales at fixed prices will come to an end on July 2. The Fuxin and Fufeng factories' supply of flour at fixed prices is a contribution to society and is worthy of admiration. The flour companies' enthusiastic sales, the foreign flour import firms and designated customers, and the Municipal Council's enthusiastic cooperation in stabilizing the flour market are also commendable. As for the Fair Price Foreign Flour Committee's handling of the distribution of fair price foreign flour for half a year, it is said that the authorities have decided to have Chinese and foreign accountants Xu Yongzuo and Tang Sheng check the accounts before formally announcing them.</p>
<h3>British Residents Inspired by the Outbreak of War Between Germany and Russia; Eager to Enlist; Fourteen Volunteers Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to inquiries from British residents yesterday, fourteen British volunteers left Shanghai the day before yesterday for Hong Kong, Singapore, and various parts of Malaya to join the British defense forces. Two joined the navy: Messrs. Beck and Backtow. Those who joined the army and navy were: Messrs. Sheffield, Phillip, Hebert, Buchanan, Fox, Carter, Rural, Debeauvoir, Walsh, Quirk, Blancro, and Ferguson. Other British volunteers who left Shanghai in June included several dozen people such as Messrs. Westpeen, Landarpi, and Baudat.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Press Resumes Operations Slightly Later</h3>
<p>The Commercial Press, which had been on strike for more than two months, has been resolved after Ms. Xing De of the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council mediated again and both parties made concessions. The company is actively adjusting internally and was originally scheduled to resume operations on July 1. According to insiders, the reorganization has not been completed and the resumption of operations on the 1st may not be possible. However, with active reorganization, the day should not be too far off.</p>
<h3>American Members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Advocate Expanding Strength; Express Deep Concern About Security in the Concession; Urge All American Residents in the City to Undergo Training Immediately</h3>
<p>A member of a certain company of the American contingent of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps sent a letter to all American residents in the city yesterday, asking them to join the American contingent immediately and strengthen the strength of the team. The letter briefly described the history of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps in order to urge American residents in Shanghai to pay attention to preserving the strength of the team. The letter expressed concern about the current strength of maintaining security in the concession, because the letter stated, "If the American contingent and other national teams are disbanded one day, American businessmen must rely on the city's police, then what will be the result?" Therefore, the letter called on American residents to join the American contingent immediately to receive "training in maintaining security, cracking down on all remote husband's actions, and mastering street fighting skills."</p>

<h3>Mr. and Mrs. Carter Depart Shanghai; Charity Groups Give Farewell Reception; Great Contribution to Supporting Relief Efforts; Residents Feel the Loss at Imminent Departure</h3>
<p>Dr. Baker, Director-General of the International Red Cross and Director of the American Red Cross, left Shanghai in January of this year, and Mr. Carter was hired by the American Red Cross to succeed him. Now that Mr. P. Carter, Chairman of the China Relief Committee of the American Red Cross, and Mr. Carter, Vice-Chairman, are both leaving Shanghai to return to the United States, 37 local charity groups held a special tea party at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tea Party Farewell</p>
<p>Guo Chengen of the Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Villagers Relief Association presided over the event, and Li Baiqiang and Li Guangcheng, Secretaries of the International Red Cross, hosted the event. More than 100 Chinese and Western guests attended, including representatives from various groups, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Guan Jiongzhi, Ming Sisui, Du Da, Wei Yanfang, Li Guiyong, Zhao Jinqing, Li Baiqiang, Li Guangcheng, and the American Assessor General Hemmerick. In addition to the Chairman's address, Powell, the editor of the Miller's Review, and others spoke about the achievements of the American Red Cross in supporting relief efforts in China. Chairman Carter and Vice-Chairman Carter then gave thank-you speeches, and finally the Chairman, on behalf of the various groups, presented gifts as a farewell souvenir. It is understood that Mr. Carter will first take the President Pierce to return to the United States on the 5th of next month, and Mr. Carter will return in August after the successor Mr. Anderson arrives in Shanghai. Now the</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of the Two Gentlemen</p>
<p>are outlined below. Captain P. Carter, a native of Missouri, USA, studied at the University of Missouri and graduated from Washington University with a Bachelor of Laws. He came to China in 1906 and served as the first judge of the US Court for China. In 1910, he resigned as a judge and lived in Mexico City for three years. In 1913, he returned to China and served as the legal representative of the British-American Tobacco Company (now renamed Yizhong Tobacco Company), and was later elected as a director. During World War I, Mr. Carter joined the army and was stationed in Tianjin. After the war, he resigned and was awarded the rank of Captain. Mr. Carter is very enthusiastic about local public welfare undertakings and often engages in them bravely and without reservation. He can be called a leader among Westerners in the Far East. Mr. Carter is currently the Chairman of the China Relief Committee of the American Red Cross and the Chairman of the American China Disaster Advisory Committee, and is responsible for distributing relief funds, rice, wheat, milk powder, medicines, etc., in huge amounts. Since the Shanghai War, although transportation has been blocked due to the extraordinary period, the relief work for refugees throughout China has still been able to proceed. The value of the relief funds and supplies distributed is several million yuan, so that countless refugees in various places are not displaced due to the war, benefiting the refugees greatly.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter was born in San Francisco, California, USA. He arrived in Shanghai on January 1, 1924 and served as the General Secretary of the US Army and Navy YMCA in China. In 1938, the American Red Cross allocated 1 million yuan worth of relief supplies to the US Ambassador to China to handle relief for Chinese refugees affected by the war. Mr. Carter was elected as the Secretary. In 1940, the China Relief Committee of the American Red Cross was established. At this time, Mr. Carter was preparing to return to the United States. The committee persuaded him to stay and serve as Deputy Director-General for a period of six months. Later, due to the matter, the deadline was extended for another half a year. Recently, because the headquarters of the American YMCA urged him, he had to leave. The successor, Mr. P.W. Anderson, has already left for China.</p>
<h3>US Consulate Prepares to Celebrate US National Day; Program Not Yet Scheduled</h3>
<p>July 4 (Friday) is the 152nd anniversary of the founding of the United States. The American community in this port believes that democratic countries are now jointly resisting aggression, and the preservation and promotion of the spirit of freedom, equality, and fraternity depend on the victory of this determined democratic group of countries. Therefore, the significance of this year's US Independence Day is even more worthy of commemoration. According to Mr. Standen, Consul of the US Consulate General, the report that the American community in Shanghai will celebrate the founding anniversary and that the US Consul General Rockhill will broadcast a speech has not yet been finalized. It is likely that the Consul General will deliver a simple speech when raising a glass to bless the motherland and President Roosevelt. Subsequently, US Consul General Rockhill said that the commemoration program has not yet been formally scheduled and will not be finalized until next Wednesday. The reports are all speculations. Mr. P. Carter, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the American Red Cross, and Director Carter have been in charge of disaster relief and have distributed millions of yuan worth of US-transported relief supplies to China. Now, by order of the General Assembly, they are being transferred from Shanghai. Thirty-seven charity groups in Shanghai specially held a banquet at the International Hotel yesterday to bid farewell (to express their thoughts of departure.

<h3>American Cargo Ships Arrive in Shanghai One After Another; Maintaining Transpacific Shipping; New Freighter Frazer Arrives This Morning; Three Other Ships Also Carry Large Quantities of Goods</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly maintain transpacific shipping and prevent it from being interrupted, the US Maritime Commission has specially dispatched the freighter Frazier from Seattle, carrying 3,000 tons of goods such as flour and kerosene to Shanghai. The ship could have arrived here at noon yesterday, but due to the route, weather, etc., it will be delayed until this morning to arrive in Shanghai and berth at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf. The ship has a deadweight of 6,751 tons, a volume of 8,500 tons, and a sea mile speed of 14 sea miles per hour. This is still her maiden voyage to Shanghai. After berthing in Shanghai for two days, she will go to Hong Kong and Manila to return to the United States. After that, she will take turns with her sister ship, the Arialva, to come to Shanghai every month, managed by the Forbes &amp; Co. In addition, the Langenbeck, agent of the American President Lines, arrived in Shanghai from New York yesterday at 11:30 a.m. The Deberq and West Huei, two freighters of the same company, with a deadweight of 3,703 tons, will arrive here successively from New York via the Panama Canal and Hong Kong today and tomorrow, each carrying a large number of American goods. Therefore, the freight transport between Shanghai and the United States will continue to come as usual in the future.</p>
<h3>Sale Price of Fixed Price Rice; Time Limit Extended</h3>
<p>According to sources, the first batch of 27,115 bags of public warehouse rice, which arrived in Shanghai on July 2, has been decided by the Public Warehouse Committee to be handed over to the Municipal Council in its entirety, and sold to food households at a price of 110 yuan per picul, in accordance with the method of selling Hong Kong rice. It is understood that the Municipal Council intended to slightly increase the price of foreign rice when selling the Mindang rice in the second phase after the first phase of 280,000 bags was sold out, because the rice quality was better. However, now that 80,000 bags of public warehouse rice have been added, it has been decided to extend the fixed price of 110 yuan per picul. According to general estimates, the Municipal Council's first phase of foreign rice still has 100,000 bags available for sale by the rice shops. Now, with the addition of 80,000 bags of public warehouse rice, it will be enough to supply the city's rice shops for more than a month. It is evident that the people's food supply in this city will become more stable.</p>
<h3>10,000 Bags of American Red Cross Relief Wheat; Donated to Refugees in This City; Can Arrive Today</h3>

In addition, the goods transported to Shanghai also include timber, diesel, and flour.</p>

Mr. Cosme, the French Ambassador to China, will award the flag and jointly swear allegiance to the Vichy government. The French army and navy troops stationed in Shanghai, the French patrol police, and the fire brigade will all participate, and the French Girl Scouts will also be invited to attend. The venue has been arranged yesterday, and the French Park will be closed this morning, and traffic will be strictly managed along the road near the French Park. If it rains, it will be postponed to July 1.</p>
<h3>Li Kaiwen Kidnapped; Escaped Danger Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Li Kaiwen, 47 years old, an employee of the Ping Yongmao Shenzhuang Store on the Grand Cathedral Street in the French Concession, was suddenly kidnapped from his residence on the 20th of last month by three armed bandits. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. At that time, the kidnappers hid Li in an unnumbered bungalow on the Jisi Fei'er Road in western Shanghai and demanded a ransom of 300,000 yuan. His family managed to sell the house and land for 18,000 yuan in legal tender and handed it over to the bandits' den, but the bandits still refused to release him. Li Kaiwen was then moved to a certain number in Jinjia Lane on Jisi Fei'er Road. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Li Kaiwen escaped while the kidnappers were asleep. Upon receiving the news, the police immediately sent police to the place to arrest two kidnappers surnamed Gao and Chen and took them to the bureau for handling.</p>

<h3>Chinese Artillery Destroyed Three Japanese Aircraft; Japanese Navy Spokesman Officially Acknowledges</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reported that the Japanese Navy spokesman said when hosting reporters yesterday (the 27th) that three days ago, the Chinese artillery bombarded the Yichang Japanese Navy Airfield, destroying three Japanese fighter planes on the airfield. He could not explain how the Chinese artillery approached the Yichang airfield. It is estimated that the artillery bombarded from across the Yangtze River, because the opposite bank of the Yangtze River is still in the hands of the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Preparation Bank to Stop Interest on Checking Accounts Starting the Day After Tomorrow; Limited Transfer to Bund Bank; Handling Fee for Exceeding Limit Causes Great Loss</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industries Joint Preparation aims to stabilize finance, adjust various interest rates, and adjust the supply and demand of remittances and checking account chips, so that cash remittances and checking accounts can be used equally, and illegal transactions of discounts and premiums in the market can be stopped. Those who want to speculate for profit by the high and low interest rates are no longer possible.</p>
<p>Adjusting Interest Rates</p>
<p>The Bank Joint Preparatory Committee recently stated that due to the concentration of floating funds in the Shanghai market, the savings deposits of clearing house accounts of various banks and firms collected by the committee have been increasing day by day, and the handling of counting money has become increasingly busy. Moreover, the deposits transferred by the committee to the banks on the Bund have a fixed amount, and an extra handling fee must be charged for the excess, which causes great losses in interest. Therefore, in order to reduce the burden, it has sent letters to various banks and firms, stating that starting from July 1, no interest will be calculated on all interbank checking account savings deposits. Restrictions will be placed on the exchange of bank deposits, and no interest will be calculated on amounts exceeding the fixed amount. The deposit interest on interbank remittances will also be adjusted, reducing it to three points per thousand yuan per day. At the same time, the lending rate in the money market has recently been reduced to three points per day.</p>
<p>Adjusting Chips</p>
<p>The chips circulating in the Shanghai market are cash remittances and checking accounts. Because remittances could not be cashed, it caused the so-called remittance discount. Since the remittance system was improved and became a new chip with a solid guarantee, remittances have changed from a discount to a premium. Now, in order to eliminate the plan, the silver and money industries immediately took remedial measures, that is, it is stipulated that if various banks and firms need remittances, they can level them with checking accounts to the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee at any time. At the same time, the four banks of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank will provide as much cash as possible to the legitimate cash needs of various industries, so that cash remittances and checking accounts can be used equally, and there must be no discrimination, eliminating the bad examples of checking accounts being more expensive than cash and remittance discounts and premiums.</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital Report</h3>
<p>The Renji Hospital's report for May is as follows: outpatient visits numbered 28,176; hospitalized patients totaled 395; hospitalized patients' length of stay totaled 8,247 days; male suicides numbered 44; female suicides numbered 54; hospitalized patients undergoing surgery numbered 162; outpatient surgical procedures numbered 316; patients sent by the Public Concession Police numbered 262; patients sent by the French Concession Police numbered 19; factory accidents and injuries numbered 21; births numbered 13; X-ray examinations numbered 1,122; prescriptions filled numbered 18,571; free inpatient days numbered 2,366; free outpatient visits numbered 871; patients sent by businesses and companies numbered 1,299. Last month, Dr. Bertelsen, the superintendent of this hospital, returned to the hospital from England after a long vacation. This hospital expresses its sincere welcome. The work in the outpatient department is busy, with 2,018 more visits than in April, and 1,272 more visits than in May of last year. This increase in workload can also be seen in the surgical cases in the outpatient department, with surgical cases being the highest for the month of May in nearly three years. The work in the X-ray department also continues to increase, with May of this year being the highest when compared to the same month in 1939 and 1940. The number of prescriptions filled has increased along with the increase in outpatient visits. Free inpatient care has also seen a slight increase compared to the past four months.</p>

<h3>Extorting Protection Money from Movie Theaters: Gang of Extortionists Cracked; Investigation in Pudong Conducted with Japanese Military; Receipts Confiscated and Detention Ordered</h3>
<p>Since May of this year, movie theaters of all sizes in the British and French concessions of this city have suddenly received threatening letters, signed by Yao Qin, head of the Tie Qing Troupe, and bearing the official seal of the Tie Qing Troupe headquarters, demanding so-called protection money, ranging from 100 to 500 yuan per month, depending on the size of the theater, specifying the amount, and setting a deadline for sending someone to Gao Miao Jinjia Bridge in Pudong to</p>
<p>Negotiate Payment</p>
<p>Otherwise, they would resort to considerable measures to retaliate. After receiving the letters, some theaters paid, while others ignored them. The Xin Guang Theater was once attacked with smoke bombs by these fellows, and the Da Shanghai Theater was attacked twice. The Guang Hua Theater on Avenue Edward VII and the Xi Hai Theater on Xin Zha Road also received similar extortion letters on June 14, instructing them to pay in Pudong the next day. This was reported to the New Concession Police, who dispatched Chinese detectives Yang Feizhang, Ruan Yao, Ma Zhongrong, Wang Shilian, etc., together with personnel from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters, to</p>
<p>Cross the River on Time</p>
<p>They hired rickshaws to Jinjia Bridge. At that time, a Ningbo native, Ye Jinbao (also known as Jiang Ya Zi, 18 years old), came forward and spoke with the detectives, instructing them to hand over the money. Shortly thereafter, Zhang Ren from Tongzhou and Wang Guilin from Pudong (only 14 years old) arrived and took the beer and cigarettes carried by the detectives. They were all arrested together. Then, they went to Ye Jinbao's home at No. 44, Lane 303, Qi Pu Road, and confiscated four official seals of the Tie Qing Troupe and the seal of the head, Yao Qin, as well as multiple receipts. All were</p>
<p>Taken Back to the Police Station</p>
<p>They confessed that the mastermind of the case was Xiang Erzhong, who was at large. Detention was ordered. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the Special Court No. 1. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case, stating that the defendants had committed many crimes and requesting a postponement. After questioning by Judge Shi, it was ruled that Ye, Zhang, and Wang would be detained pending further investigation and questioning.</p>
<h3>Incessant Heavy Rains Cause Tragedy in Nanshi; House Collapse Kills More Than Ten People; Pacific Typhoon Approaching</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory has learned that the entire climate in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Hankou, Jiujiang, Anqing, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, has been controlled by the plum rain season. The weather in Shanghai will also not clear up for the time being. The temperature this morning also dropped sharply, reaching only 72 degrees at 5:00 AM. Starting from dawn on the 25th, torrential rains have been falling continuously in this city, amounting to 181.5 centimeters in total over the past three days until noon yesterday. The intensity of the rainfall is the highest this year.</p>
<p>Typhoon Approaching</p>
<p>According to reports, the Pacific typhoon had already reached 18 degrees north latitude and 121 degrees east longitude at 5:00 AM yesterday. The direction is northwest. According to the reported location, the typhoon has reached the north of Luzon. If it continues to move northwest without changing direction, it will approach the South China Sea area of our country.</p>
<p>Tragedy in Nanshi</p>
<p>Due to the continuous heavy rains, the accumulated water on various low-lying roads has not yet receded. In particular, the waterlogging in western Shanghai and Zhabei is still knee-deep. It is reported that five or six bungalows at the entrance of Jinjiafang, Zhao Fang Lane, in Nanshi, were eroded by rainwater during the heavy rain the day before yesterday and suddenly collapsed. This happened in the middle of the night, resulting in more than ten people being crushed to death and more than twenty people injured.</p>
<p>Traffic in the Western District</p>
<p>According to a notice issued yesterday by the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, all buses running in the western district will resume service starting this morning. Only Route 2 was running in the area yesterday. Starting this morning, Route 1 and Route 14 will also join. In the past four days, service was temporarily suspended because a section of Yuyuan Road to St. George's was flooded.</p>
<h3>Falsely Established Company Defrauds for Profit; Main Culprit at Large, Apprentice Arrested</h3>
<p>The Run Kang Yong Cotton Yarn Company, located in Room 354, 5th Floor, Securities Building, Jiujiang Road, was established by Qi Zhaokang and Qi Zhaoji with pooled funds. Since its opening, it has been in operation for less than a few months, and business has been slow. Zhao Bingyan, Qi Yongkang, and Lu Junfu, who are engaged in the cotton yarn business, purchased three batches of cotton yarn from Run Kang Yong on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, totaling: (1) 60 bales, for a price of 93,495 yuan; (2) 20 bales, for a price of 31,105 yuan; (3) 10 bales, for a price of 15,532.5 yuan. At the time, they paid three checks from the Qianzhuang and requested warehouse receipts, but were told to wait two hours to pick them up and were given three temporary receipts. When they went to pick up the warehouse receipts two hours later, only one apprentice was left in the company. The company owners, Qi Yongkang and others, had absconded with the money. At that time, lawyer Qian Shusheng, representing the company, announced liquidation. Realizing that they had been deceived, they reported to the Old Concession Police, who dispatched Chinese Deputy Detective Tao Gengrong and Detective Xu Wenbin to investigate. Because Song Yongfu (19 years old), an apprentice from Ningbo at the company, had secretly communicated with Qi Yongkang and others, he was arrested at midnight and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Division of the Special Court No. 1. Police lawyer Fang Fushu stated the facts of the case, requesting a postponement. After questioning by Judge Yu, it was ruled that Song Yongfu would be detained pending further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Pedestrian on Avenue Joffre Arrested by Japanese</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday, a young Chinese man was walking at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Massenet in the French Concession when he was suddenly arrested by plainclothes Japanese personnel stationed there. After being taken to the French police station, he was transferred to the Japanese side. It is reported that the arrested man is named Zhang Xi, from Shandong, 25 years old. The reason for the arrest is unknown.</p>

<h3>Case of Performing Obscene Songs and Dances; Summoning of Hotel Owner</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New Hotel at 579 Jiujiang Road rents its downstairs hall to the Xin Le Palace Theater. However, the theater specializes in performing various obscene and indecent plays, using the naked performances of entire young girls as a gimmick, which is extremely demoralizing. Other theaters, such as the Wan Shang Tea House on Wu Ma Road, as well as the Da Luo Tian and Times Theater, have followed suit, performing similar plays. In order to rectify social customs, the Public Concession authorities went to the Xin Le Palace on the 16th of the month and arrested five young girls who were performing naked, and sent them to the Special Court No. 1 for separate punishment. Because Xu Mengyuan, the Ningbo owner of the Shanghai New Hotel, also violated Article 231 of the Criminal Code, the police requested the Special Court to issue a summons. Xu Mengyuan was ordered to appear in court yesterday morning, but he refused to comply. Police lawyer Fang Fushu stated the facts of the case, requesting a postponement. Judge Dai ruled that the case would be postponed pending further summons of the defendant for investigation.</p>

<h3>Several Tasks to Do During Vacation</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>Children, when you see this topic, you must feel very strange. Why do we still have to work during summer vacation? Why does the school give us summer vacation? It's for us to rest, right? Yes, schools give summer vacation to students to let their bodies rest. But children, don't get it wrong. The meaning of vacation is not for children to just eat and do nothing all day and become lazy bugs, nor do they want you to be muddle-headed bugs wandering around all day. Its original intention is to adjust the serious school life so that in the active and free family life, you can still make reasonable progress in body and knowledge.</p>
<p>I have said that family life is free, active, and trivial. There is no teacher to teach, only parents to supervise. Because of the affection between parents and children, it is not as serious as a teacher. The quality of the results during the vacation depends on how much each child automatically works. From observing the lives of children in past vacations, some indulge in playing, their bodies become thin, and even in the first few weeks of school, they have no mood to study. Some children still work regularly under active living conditions. They sometimes read, sometimes work, and spend their time very well. At the end of the vacation, their grades are not bad after all. At work, their bodies and knowledge have made significant progress.</p>
<p>Children? We know that work can make our bodies stronger, increase our knowledge, and also get great joy and rich experience, and the rest after work is the most needed and the most comfortable. The scope of work is very wide, and there are many types. Now, I will list the work suitable for vacation below, hoping that children? can use them as you wish and apply them.</p>
<p>1. Read more books and newspapers: Regarding books, choose beneficial children's books, and reject all serial cartoons that are immoral and corrupting. When reading, in addition to understanding the content, you should also study the structure and pay attention to good sentences and difficult sentences. As for newspapers, they are spiritual food, and you must read them every day. Moreover, in this era of unpredictable international events, we cannot afford not to read them to broaden our horizons.</p>
<p>2. Clean the house: During this summer season, we must keep our homes clean to avoid the spread of diseases. Children should urge their families to pay attention and help with brushing and sweeping, or have a major cleaning once a week. On the one hand, develop a habit of labor, and on the other hand, reduce diseases.</p>
<p>3. Teach people to read: Among your family members or neighbors, if they like to read but don't have the opportunity, then you can use this long vacation to teach them to read, or tell meaningful stories to improve their character and explain the pain of not being able to read.</p>
<p>4. Group meetings: Gather a few like-minded classmates, sisters, or brothers, and hold a meeting once a week to discuss difficult problems, go out for a trip together, study current affairs, or have legitimate entertainment, so as to connect feelings and get more knowledge.</p>
<p>5. Review arts books: Review the books you have read at any time to avoid forgetting them and not let down the hard work we put in at the time.</p>
<p>The above points are my general opinions. If children have more valuable work, they can go ahead and implement them. In short, every child should not let the precious vacation pass by in laziness and idleness. Finally, I hope that children's bodies and knowledge will advance in both aspects during the vacation.</p>
<h3>The Plum Rain Season</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>It rained for a day and a night in a row, and the low-lying roads suddenly accumulated water. Even the lane where Ah Hui's family lived was inevitably submerged in mud and water, turning into a small river. A different kind of water scene was reflected in Ah Hui's eyes, making him feel strangely interesting. Fortunately, his school had been on summer vacation since the day before yesterday, so he was not affected by this water accumulation. However, his father was heavily "fleeced" by rickshaw pullers for errands. Just a short stretch of road that could be seen was priced at four or five jiao, and there was no room for negotiation. This kind of business could be done, and if those hoarders and profiteers heard about it, they would be very envious.</p>
<p>With such a large amount of rain falling and the temperature not dropping, the plum rain season has formed. Ah Hui feels very hot and uncomfortable all over, as if he is being steamed.</p>
<p>"The sunlight in the plum rain season is very strong, the air is humid, and the climate is hot. This kind of hot and humid air can increase the temperature of our skin and slow down the circulation of blood. But when blood circulation slows down, it cannot get enough oxygen to supply the brain and other parts of the body, so we feel very uncomfortable. This phenomenon is exactly the opposite of the warm season of spring, so we all like spring and hate this plum rain weather. You should know that the plum rain season does not exist in the whole world, but is unique to our country and Japan. It probably starts when the plums turn yellow, which is in the middle of the fifth lunar month, but this year's plum rain is a bit late, so it is also called "late plum rain." The plum rain season lasts for about a month, and the weather is very depressing. So why does it happen? In June of the Gregorian calendar, when the sun shines directly on the Yangtze River basin of our country, a low-pressure area occurs, but it does not stop in one place, but slowly advances eastward. If a low-pressure area occurs, it will rain. When the low-pressure area is moving eastward, it turns out that the high-pressure area in the northern Pacific Ocean is also very developed. Once there is a high-pressure area, the sky will become clear, but the high-pressure area just stops the advance of the low-pressure area, but the low-pressure area cannot defeat the high-pressure area, so it shrinks back and has to stay in the Yangtze River basin area, so every day it is covered with dark clouds and the sunlight cannot be seen, and the temperature is very high and the air is humid. This is the plum rain season." Ah Ming answered such a long passage, thinking that his brother would not ask any more questions.</p>
<p>"Brother, why does the lane accumulate water?" Ah Hui still asked endlessly, which was really beyond Ah Ming's expectations.</p>
<p>"Of course, it's because the terrain of the lane is too low, because water likes to flow to low places. Think about it, with such heavy rain, plus the large tide in the Huangpu River, the rainwater cannot all flow into the Huangpu River, and the water from the Huangpu River flows back from the sewers, so the water gathers in low places." Ah Ming said here, and finally stopped Ah Hui's questions."</p>
<h3>The Story of Fluorescent Lamps</h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>In the countryside, you can see fireflies on summer nights. Their tails emit a faint glow. Children like to catch them and put them in glass bottles to play with, which is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of fireflies, the ancients had a misunderstanding and believed that they were transformed from decaying grass. For example, the Monthly Orders says: "Decaying grass transforms into fireflies." The Erya also says: "Decaying grass gets the heat and humidity and becomes fireflies." This is of course due to a lack of understanding of biology.</p>
<p>Although the firefly is small, its heart is bright. It lives by the water and grass and has its own light, not assimilated by the dark night, and not damaged by wind and rain. In the dark universe, it comes and goes alone and acts according to its nature. It can be said to be the "outstanding" of insects!</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Electric Power Company issued a call for the city to save electricity due to the lack of fuel sources, how to save electricity has been a concern for all Shanghai residents. As a result, "fluorescent lamps" have recently appeared, coming all the way from the United States.</p>
<p>Speaking of "fluorescent lamps," there was a legend in ancient China that firefly cages were used instead of lamps to illuminate ferry passengers. However, the "fluorescent lamps" made by major companies in Nanjing Road today are based on scientific principles and emit light by electricity, without any real fireflies inside. However, the shape and color are somewhat like fireflies. Only the ancient "fluorescent lamps" were truly worthy of the name. According to the Book of Jin, "At that time, there was a man named Che Yin, who was young and eager to learn and studied day and night without stopping. But because his family was poor, he often had no lamp oil, so he made a gauze bag and filled it with fireflies to light his reading." This is a good story of a wise man studying hard in poverty, and it is also the origin of saving lamp oil and inventing "fluorescent lamps."</p>
<h3>Before Dawn</h3>
<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>There was a very large rice weevil with a peculiar temperament. It felt that it was boring to stay in the rice jar all day and wanted to fly into the sky to play and see things that its kind had never had the pleasure of seeing. But because it had no wings, it could not realize its ideal. However, its heart did not die because of this, but became even more enthusiastic. Since it could not fly by itself, it had to ask Mr. Pheasant to help it achieve its dream. Although Mr. Pheasant was originally unwilling, he could not resist its sincerity of "three kneelings and nine kowtows" and could only agree.</p>
<p>Mr. Pheasant asked Mrs. Pheasant to take a piece of silk cloth and instructed the rice weevil to say, "You must use all your strength to bite this rope and never let go, and you must never say a word! Remember!" The rice weevil, in order to feast its eyes, of course agreed to everything.</p>
<p>So the pheasant couple used their mouths to hold both ends of the hemp thread and quickly flew into the high sky, crossed rivers, flew over forests, and crossed mountains, and later arrived at the plain. It saw green water, red flowers, green grass, gray soil…</p>
<p>A person saw this strange sight and shouted loudly, "Come and see! Come and see! A rice weevil and two pheasants are flying in the sky together!" "Where? Where?" everyone asked in surprise. "There, there, there!" he replied. People all gave up their work to see this wonder of the world - the rice weevil flying into the sky. "Ah! What a happy rice weevil!" someone exclaimed.</p>
<p>The rice weevil was very happy to see so many people watching it and felt infinitely glorious. Later, when it heard someone calling it a happy rice weevil, it was even happier and forgot that it was a wingless parasite.</p>
<p>"Haha!" It laughed triumphantly. "I have finally become..." Before it could finish speaking, its body suddenly fell and landed on the ground, becoming a pile of mush.</p>
<p>The pheasant couple also flew down, snatched its corpse, and kept it for a delicious breakfast tomorrow.</p>
<p>Dawn: The rooster crows, the pheasant enjoys the rights, and the rice weevil can no longer fly. Disclaimer: The manuscript "Wishing You a Bright Future" last Sunday was written by Mr. Yang Chunlu. The signature was omitted. This is to state.</p>
<h3>Eagle Pen Holder</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>Children! Let me tell you how to make a very simple eagle pen holder.</p>
<p>First, take a look at the picture here. One piece is the eagle's body, and the other is the eagle's wings. First, enlarge the two parts on drawing paper and then color them.</p>
<p>The second step is to paste them onto cardboard and cut them out after they are dry. At this time, you can insert the mortise and tenon together, and the eagle frame will be successful. Isn't it very easy?</p>
<p>If the material is not cardboard, but thin bamboo chips or lead sheets, and then painted with colored paint on the outside, it will be more durable and more beautiful.</p>

<h3>Cao Yu's Satirical Comedy</h3>
<p>— Sha Fei</p>
<p>Following "Song of Righteousness," the Shanghai Drama Society will perform Cao Yu's adapted satirical comedy, "Gilded." The play was originally titled "Blinding Sand."</p>
<p>"Gilded," in two acts, has a simple story:</p>
<p>"Doctor Ma Shouqing has a daughter named Ma Meie, who is just of age. Mr. Zhao Yunting has a grown son named Zhao Wenming. These two young people spend their days playing music and singing together, and secretly fall in love. Later, after some negotiation between the parents, they decide to arrange a marriage, a union of two noble families. However, to save face, they have to put on a lavish display, and in order to support this 'gilded' facade, they almost tear apart the young couple's love affair."</p>
<p>I have always been very fond of Cao Yu's plays, such as "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise." Although this satirical comedy is just for the audience to laugh at, upon closer examination, it is completely targeted at reality, targeted at Shanghai. He portrays many hypocrites who only care about appearances and don't care about the reality inside, running around every day, busy and busy, just putting on a show and acting powerful.</p>
<p>Hong Mo's direction of "Gilded" is quite light and witty. In terms of actors, Han Fei, who plays Ma Shouqing, pretends to have fake hair on his fake bald head, and is funny in every word and deed. Bai Li's portrayal of Mrs. Ma is a typical shrew, just right. Others, such as Zhi Jun as Zhao Yunting, Mei Cun as Mrs. Zhao, and He Bin as Zhao Ershu, are also competent. But the most humorous is Tian Ran as Zhao Wenming, with a strange voice, strange walk, and even stranger posture, simply a bizarre character. As soon as he says a word, the audience laughs along, and the whole hall is filled with laughter - from the opening to the closing.</p>
<p>In addition to "Gilded," the one-act play "The Proposal" is also being performed. This play is originally by Chekhov, adapted by Ping Qun, and directed by Zuo Lin.</p>
<p>In "The Proposal," we see Lord Li, who bullies the poor and loves the rich (played by Yan Jun), that is, stripping away the social facade, we see the myriad aspects of ordinary people. Jian Ping plays Zhao Baoshi, who is a cripple, and Dai Yun plays Li Songzhen, who is a hunchback. These two ugly people meet together. The story of the play has a very good intention and is extremely interesting. I love Yan Jun's Lord Li the most. He recites his lines fluently, and his expressions of laughter, sorrow, and hatred are all very authentic.</p>
<p>"Gilded" and "The Proposal" are both excellent satirical comedies. Standing in the position of a purely objective audience, I would like to sincerely recommend them to all those who love drama.</p>
<h3>Zhang Wenjuan to Return to Shanghai to Perform</h3>
<p>— Dr. Lu</p>
<p>Beijing is the birthplace of Peking Opera and the place where famous actors are produced. To pursue advanced studies in Peking Opera, it is best to "study abroad" in Beijing. Here, we are talking about Zhang Wenjuan. Like the previous year, she resolutely went to Beijing with a fighting heart, and has been away from Shanghai for almost two years. Such a young girl can already sing with flavorful sounds and pleasing tones. I heard that she has a very good reputation in Beijing, and she is also a female actor who is saving face for the Jiangnan region. She is now resting at home due to the hot weather in Beijing, diligently practicing Kunqu Opera. Rumor has it that she will be performing in Shanghai soon. With her talent and the art that has been nurtured for two years, as well as her popularity in Shanghai, she will definitely be able to achieve the best results in the future.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 11: A Valiant Figure Comes to Fight Fiercely</p>
<p>Li Zicheng was horrified and had no idea what to do. Niu Jinxing immediately ordered his subordinates to shoot arrows at the fire, like locusts flying, to protect the central army tent. At the same time, he ordered the troops behind not to retreat, or they would be beheaded. Zhou Yuji could not break through after all. A tiger riding a slippery-backed horse, grabbed a Zao Yang spear, rushed forward, and shouted, "Zhou, don't mess around, I, Luo, am not afraid of you!" He thrust the spear forward and fought fiercely with Zhou Yuji. Xu Jing took the opportunity to enter, charged and killed for a while, but was also shot by random arrows and could not go deep. He heard fierce shouts of killing on the left, knowing that Zhou Yuji was fighting the rebels, so he urged his men to kill into the fire. The two sides fought fiercely for a while. As it approached the fifth watch (around 4 AM), Zhou Yuji saw that the rebels were becoming more and more numerous and had prepared themselves, fearing that he would be surrounded, so he and Xu Jing withdrew their troops. The rebels did not dare to pursue and kill in the night. Zhou Yuji retreated into the city, and the east was gradually turning white, and the rain was gradually stopping. He said to Xu Jing, "Tonight we fought very happily. The rebels must have suffered at least several thousand casualties. It is a pity that we failed to kill the rebel leader, but we have also thwarted their spirit." He then instructed Xu Jing and the soldiers to rest. He himself handed over the city's defenses to Zhang Lie and Fan Cheng, and also returned to the yamen to sleep for a while. When he woke up, it was almost noon. After a little food, he heard that the rebels had come to attack the city again, and he went up to the city to defend it again. He was worried that the bows and arrows would be in short supply, so he instructed the craftsmen to make them quickly. He also ordered the people to carry stones to the city to defend against the attack. That day, Li Zicheng was very angry because the official army had raided his camp and suffered losses the night before, so he waited for his men to come and attack fiercely. The southwest gates were attacked even more fiercely. Zhou Yuji guarded the west city himself, ordered Xu Jing and Zhang Lie to guard the south gate, and ordered Fan Cheng to take charge of the northeast gates. The rebel soldiers attacked for a long time, but the city was as solid as gold, and they did not gain any advantage. Li Zicheng saw that Daizhou was so difficult to take down, and Zhou Yuji was also a brave general, so he was very anxious. He went to Taiyuan to mobilize a large number of rebels to come and reinforce him. He himself surrounded the southwest gates and attacked them day and night. After three days, both the official army and the rebels were a little tired. Xu Jing saw from the south gate that there were clouds of rebels under the city, and the attack was becoming more and more urgent. It turned out that the rebels' fresh troops had arrived, so they intensified their attack on the city. (102)</p>
