<h3 id="c24">寇利與松岡 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>寇利是美國白宮參議。松岡是日本外務大臣。寇利負了美總統所賦迄未公開的使命，飛到中國陪都重慶，與國民政府當局密切接觸之後，遄歸華府。松岡以直接肩負外交責任的身分，聘問德義，於路過莫斯科與蘇聯領袖長談一小時之後，纔到柏林。寇利好似啞巴而松岡則本身便是一隻話匣子。寇利究竟怎樣呈覆，雖迭經各地報人包圍叩詢而諱莫如深，可以想見其人如何嚴謹；然而旬餘以來，世人先後至少已有三决機會，得自間接的方面，窺知報告書的一部分：其一，中國所需美國借予軍具的淸單，已經遞達美國當局；其二，美總統已經答復保證必予中國以援助；這兩點、顯然淵源於寇利的報告；其三，路透社華府電訉謂寇利報告書的內容，美國報章昨日初次餓所披露，這是確指了。據稱：寇利謂中國所需極簡單，飛行堡壘不逾二十架。新式戰門機約二百架，飛行汽油與鋼製戰具以及大砲與彈藥各若干；又謂中國得此即足打退日本，故主張美國對遠東務取大膽的外交；此外尙有未經確指為寇利報告之內容的種種說法，詳載昨報，不再徵引。凡此消息，當然使聞者吿慰，人心稱快。但是一切原在情理與意料之中，並非突然形成的新境界；因為美國政策是一貫的，不是依據了寇利報告而設計如此，決策如此。推想寇利報告書在美國整個政策之中所居的地位，是蒐集了供給了政策的更多而更新之論據；為綱領增訂了細目，為規畫演繹了方案；使一貫的政策。由細膩而謹愼的推進，從此大膽的放手做去。這便是寇利此行的性能與成就吧！至於長途旅行之中的話匣子，當然配齊了生角旦角乃至丑角的唱片，他究竟如何生能。將有如何成就，目前加以估計，雖似嫌早，然運用喇叭於伈伈俔俔的情緒之下，則目前即已顯見。在他初登行程，未出國門的時候，欿然自感不足，他祇敢承認旨在實地視察，他要日人鎭而靜不要存何奢望，他充分流露了不自信與沒把握。他一路哼着和平的調調兒。他從滿洲里入蘇聯境，直到訪謁史夫令莫洛托夫而得長談之前，不知道長談而祇稱禮儀的拜候。莫洛托夫他們原來是動輒長談的，前年德外長里賓洛夫到莫斯科長談之後蘇德携手了；去年莫洛托夫到柏林與里賓特洛夫長談之後，據說蘇聯對德國的向東南歐擴展，率直警告；這一次蘇日長談的結果，未經發表，世人當然無從確悉松岡是做了前年莫斯科的里賓特洛夫，還是做了去年柏林的特洛夫？還是禮儀了一小時之久？離了莫斯科，前往柏林；他或是未便，或是不敢，卻也是不再說所謂「旨在實地視察」。不但如此，他收拾了伈　　伈俔俔的態度；在奔趨柏林的火車中，他昂然勸告美國注意渠在聘問時期之德義首都事件。當然，到麗雅為止，誰都不知道，要松岡滯留於德義首都的期間，德義首都墜子鋪張揚厲，空前熱鬧的歡迎，而松岡即是其間榮耀的特客，或可為好萊塢影片商攝製花團錦簇的新聞片之外，德義首都還將發生何種事件，値得美國注意？美國當前所注意的，祗是推進其一貫的政策，允在寇利報吿之後，更可能的大胆推進！松岡到達柏林之後，發表敬告德國人士書，表示日人願與德義共甘苦，表示日本對三國盟的的忠實，祝望德國勝利，祝望他們的新秩序之成功，這是禮儀上的文章；仔細聽了，祇是沒餓新腔的老調。同在這一日，美國總統在海面遊艇上，鋻署了美金七十萬圓的軍具租借經費案，完成了推進一貫政策的骨幹之手續。總合這些而比較觀之，啞巴象徵著咬緊牙關，沉默前進，而對方的忽爾　然，忽爾昂然，則其趨歸報應雖無所逃於泥淖之中早已註定了的命運，然松岡之所以遠行，既因徬徨不知所趨，而到了德義之後，可能的依然依然徬徨，以迄歸途的重經莫斯科。</p>

<p>本報關於西綫戰事的經過，曾經發表過好幾篇譯文，如英法美記者和軍官的報道與日記，都是現代信史，不過各名家的著述都是一個角度裏的觀察，美國生活圖畫週報現已集腋成裘，作成專文，茲譯錄於後，作為這一段戰史的結論以供留心軍事者的硏究：</p>
<p>去年五月間，德軍以六星期的時間，擊破荷比法三國，當時一般人都把閃電戰當作特異的全新　術。其實德軍所根據的還是數白年相傳下來的軍事原則，不過加以新式的　用罷了。現在事過　遷，巳有十個月之久，這彪炳千古的戰績，當可用冷靜的頭腦，加以淸楚的分析。這篇便是根據德軍及聯軍最高軍事當局向守秘密的情報而作</p>
<p>自上决世界大戰以來，聯軍曾鑄下一個大錯，以為兩軍作戰之時，各自深溝高壘，使戰局膠着，乃是常事。豈知不然。上决歐戰乃是一個反常的特殊情形。當時或因自動軍器和火力的進步，暫時超過步軍前進的能力，纔產生了這種例外。德國參謀部始終相信戰爭惟有取攻勢纔能取勝，防禦工事決非堅不可破的。</p>
<p>法軍保有每英里耗費一百萬元所築成的馬奇諾防綫，自阿爾卑斯山綿亙至法比邊界的塞當，便自以為有恃無恐。至於保障北面的側翼，直至一九三六年，都靠着比利時郞威至麥士特列克，再沿亞爾倍運河至安特衛普的一道防綫。此外，比利時又築了一道輔助防綫，從塞當沿未斯河至那摩爾。復沿地耳河至安特衛普，在此與亞爾倍運河防綫啣接一九三六年，比利時改變政策，脫離英法同盟，宣佈「嚴守中立」法國始由塞當至英吉利海峽，沿着比國邊境倉卒築成一道「小馬奇諾防綫。」</p>
<p>現在知道德國在去年五月發動攻勢以前，動員軍隊達六七百萬人，編為兩百四十師，外加其他必要的輔助隊。德軍集中在法比邊界的不下一百五十師。至於聯軍方面法國有一百十五師英軍開到的僅有十師比軍有十六師至二十師荷軍有十四師。</p>
<p>德軍進攻的方略極其狡猾。一九一四年，德軍按照舒利芬計劃，以美茲為攻擊的中樞，盡量增强右翼，由比利時迂迴進攻。這一决德軍假裝仍照這個計劃進兵，實際匕却以塞當為攻擊中樞，集中全力，以期在附近突破一點。</p>
<p>德軍為　　英法，誘敵深人比境起見，首先北攻荷蘭，以引英法入毅。實則德一百五十師中，用以對付十四師荷軍的僅有六七師而已。</p>
<p>德軍於五月十日晨三時二十分進攻荷蘭，非正規的戰術最是發揮得淋漓盡致，新　的事實也層出不窮所謂「垂直包　」戰略，在歷史上是第一决運用，第一决成功了。步兵用飛機運輸，而且數額極多，在戰術運用上有着決定的影響，亦為曠古所無。荷軍訓練優良，指揮得　，裝配士氣均佳，然而德軍不出叫日，居然能以寡擊衆，一舉破敵，這完全得力於空軍，傘兵（即空軍陸戰隊），和第五縱隊的運用得當。德軍又看出荷蘭防綫的兩處弱點：一在末斯河南岸赫托琴抱煦的附近，一在更南荷蘭批爾防錢和北國防綫之間。但是這一路的攻勢，不過為侵比的輔助，所以德軍力求减少代價。沿荷蘭南部邊境進擊跨越洛特丹，杜勒希，馬狄克三處大橋，直趨荷蘭心臟，乃是最便宜的一條路綫。德軍為防止荷軍炸燬道許多橋樑計，便利用傘兵和第五縱隊。荷蘭境內所有德人和荷籍國社黨人，總數不下十萬，事先都接受了實仃此項任　的詳細訓令。</p>

<p>關於本年農工董競選問題、聞英美日三國總領事刻正進行會談中，其結果競選於四月九日與十日舉行前、諒可商得解決辦法、衆認總領事進行之談話、若吿圓滿結束、則本年度當不致舉行選舉、惟談話進展如何、未悉其詳、僅有關方面默認確已不斷舉行會議而已、聞三國總領事間之現行談話、乃英日僑民選舉委員會旨在商妥「君子協定」而進行的初步談判之結果、</p>
<p>美僑旨在保持權益</p>
<p>美僑聯合會主席即本年度美董候選人明思德昨（二十七日）晨聲稱、渠今不能有所發表、但美僑聯合會刻正儘其所能為者、保持美人在上海之權利云、若干人士相信本年度工董比數、將有變動、而董事九席、或將由英美日俐平均分配、</p>
<p>英美日領進行討論</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、近日外間對於英美日三國僑民代表就工董競選事進行之談判、結果如何一節、傳說紛紜、惟據昨日（二十六日）確悉、此事業已完全脫離英美日僑民委員會之掌握、蓋工董九席、在三國僑民間如何支配、始稱最佳一點、現已完全移交駐滬英美日總領事辦理也、聞英總領事喬治總領事洛克赫德與日總領事崛內、對於此點、進行討論、已有日矣、而所以特別要求工董年選展期者、為予三總領事以機會、俾能對此問題商得解決辦法也、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報評論云、據柏林傳來之消息稱、該處日本觀察家現正懷疑此次日本外相松岡洋右聘問德義時、能否自德兩國取得援助之諾言、以應付太平洋萬一事件、此項報吿實為吾人於久苦未能覓得幽默趣事時唯一引人發笑之故事、吾人固無須待彼等談話結束、而以最後答覆送交松岡時、卽可代其答覆曰、日本不能自德國獲得任何援助、惟泊於日本港口之</p>
<p>德國船隻</p>
<p>屆時或將較現在有更大之行動自由、而出入於公海之間、然彼等一旦啟椗、必將為德國服務、決不為日本工作、此則可以斷言也、不特現在如此、即至他日、德國亦決不致以任何飛機·戰艦或其他軍用品供給日本、德國所將給予日本者、僅為「合作」與「勸吿」等之口惠耳、除此而外、實不能有</p>
<p>任何實質</p>
<p>上之援助、任何人若對此方表示懷疑、則可請視義大利之前例、在希軍大獲勝利、北菲英軍連戰皆捷以前、德國對義大利固未甞加以任何援手、最後、德軍雖出而干涉、並派遣機械化之飛機及陸軍至阿爾巴尼亞及里比亞、然此舉之目的、並非援助義軍勝利、而僅為防免義大利於滅亡而已、綠義軍若再敗績、德國終將</p>
<p>蒙其不利</p>
<p>而歸於失敗也、若日本圖由德國獲得援助其可能性較德國援助義大利更為徵少、其原因實由於種種困難、即使德國欲予援助、亦難辦到、因海權一日由英國控制、德國之飛機·坦克·船隻·艦艇·剽襲艦及軍隊、即一日不能抵達日本、如英國海軍喪失其控制歐亞間航綫之能力、則日本固無需德國之援助矣、日本固迷信德國將獲致勝利故在</p>
<p>毫無把握</p>
<p>之時、甘冒危險、以國運為財注、其危險實甚、松岡若圖與此類商人作新交易、其事先應獲得良好可靠之保證、如能更進一步與彼等斷絕營業往來、以免將來遭傾家蕩產之命運、則尤為上策也、</p>

<p>人生的大道上，原有許多意想不到的波折的：記得在二十六年的冬天，我滿意地將與上海一別而去到了蘇州，不料戰事逼我徒步逃難到了鎭江，從鎭江逃至江北的仙女廟，找到了朋友，再逃至奔波於渝漢的水道上，住在漢口，又去過九江和彭澤，後來又在宜昌，巴東，萬縣，重慶等地長住了好幾個月，最後又往渝滇公路，滇越路，越南國有路而抵　了西貢。在那裏，住了二年，至今年的一月二十八日，方返到了這變成了孤島的上海。</p>
<p>在離開上海的前夜，我郵過大世界和先施公司的炸彈慘案，在滬西陳家渡，我曾在同胞炸傷的身軀上踏過而逃進租界。離了上海，又時常在警報聲中過活，所以離了昆明，剛到河內，見了高的新式建築，燈紅洒綠的咖啡館，劍湖上的划舟，美軟的憧憬，在在使我緊張的神經鬆懈下來。在這和暖的河內，我曾把在國內辛辛苦苦省下的國幣，四元換一元的折成了越幣，在這安逸的境界裏化去了不少。到了西貢不久，歐戰又爆發了，這平靜的南洋，也像入了魔似地，開始緊張起來了。街上不少人改穿了軍裝，可是娛樂塲所還是依舊。等到德法停戰，越南雖然連火藥氣也沒嗅到，也祇得戴起「國孝」來了。除了電影院外，別的娛樂塲所都祇能關門停辦。此後泰越邊境發生了糾紛，西貢也就時常Black　Out從此平靜的越南，也就戴起了「孝服」，一付哭喪着的臉兒，也就令人見了傷心！</p>
<p>大達南輪把我們　返這故鄕的上海來了：船進吳淞口的時候，同船的郎二小姐說她心跳得厲害，我自己也覺得有一種說不出來的不安；上海，這闊別了三年餘的故鄕，可不知是何景色呢？在公和祥媽頭下了船，卡車送我們上高恩路去，先經過冷靜的虬口，入租界看見那種齷齪的小弄，和那擠滿了人的破屋子，我曾歡了一聲：「這種「住」眞不是「人」住的。的確上海小市民的住，在別處我是從未見過的！</p>
<p>在未到上海前，朋友們來信常說上海是怎樣的更繁華了，金門，大華，以及享樂塲所等等的名字，在我都是久聞大名，而迄未識荊的地方；同船有面個「老上海」的外國人也曾為上海的繁華而吹噓，祇有一位「老北平」的法國人，却說上海，北平，天津等地，都在遭受空前未有的災難。</p>
<p>在下船前，同學嚴君和我說，辛苦了幾年，到了上海，先住那遠東最高的國際飯店，再上那些「聞而未見」過的地方去看看玩玩，在烟火氣裏擠出來的我，也覺得這是返滬後第一着的行踪，不料下船後大家分散了，先遇見了些舊時的親友，再聽了些上海的新聞，原來的主意，就不知跟了那一陣風而吹散了。</p>
<p>二個月來，我曾遇見了舊時闊綽，現在行成癟三的朋友，也曾到過已一變而為富翁的朋友們的新住宅裏吃過飯，三年半的闊別，一切都像「變戲法」地「變」了，街上到處是人，舞塲裏，車上，酒樓裏，戲院裏，飯店裏，茶樓裏，到處是「客滿：」米價高漲，生活無法維持，罷工，也是這「孤島」上日日聽得到的字句。上海原是個無法瞭解的畸形都市，成了「孤島」後的上海，更是無法讓識的一個神秘都市！</p>

<p>新近到滬之衛丹醫學博士，最新醫術之發明家也，其術之新奇足使本市人仕驚異，蓋衛丹博士，毋需藥石之助，衹以兩小金屬棒接觸鼻間，立治各病，按衛丹博士所發明之理論，深信各種疾病，山於人體神經——名曰交感大神經——功用失調所致，良以此神經實為吾人康健之主宰也，大神經復分無數小神經，佈散全軀而止於鼻黏液膜，衛丹博士經十五年之研究，對於該大小神經之支配，瞭如指掌，深知接觸神經上某點，能使體內某器官反應，而遂能療治該器管之疾病焉。</p>
<p>無數不治之病，經衛丹博士之新法療治，莫不癸如神，有如氣喘之病者，衹於施術數次，其病若失，氣和喘平，更有神經過敏之人，最易驚悸怔忡，或覺神經失其控制，往往無故發怒，或意志頹喪，一經衛丹博士施其新療法，即見心氣平靜，愉快自信矣。</p>
<p>夜間失眠，受治後睡眠酣暢，以治風濕骨痛，疼痛立止，且衛丹這新醫術，尤能調節血脈之循環，故婦女常患之月經病，如經痛及閉經等症，凡受過博士療治者，經痛若失，月經正常。</p>
<p>至於未老先衰之症，每覺神衰力弱，一經衛丹博士新法療治，神采煥發，精氣蓬勃，叛若兩人，今因博士環游全球，宜揚其術，路經上海，小作勾留，二三月後，便又他適，凡患上列病家，欲觀其新術醫治者，幸勿失諸交臂，速來診治俾得早占勿藥也。</p>
<p>據悉衛丹博士現寓外灘華懋飯店七〇七號房間，每日上午十時至一時，下午四時至六時門診，一切病家，須受博士檢騐其病狀及反應，方始施術，並非貿然從事者所可比擬也。</p>

<p>雙馬晨開市即已平淡、首盤價爲一千四百元、此盤一開、賣者業集、即刻鬆至一千三百九十元、旋後聞外滙平庸、盈利者扒補、市盤乃漸漸回上至一千三百九十九元、但客銷頗爲寂寞、新買戶仍乏興奮、市情又軟化、回至一千三百九十三四元、此價迴旋殊久、迨至收盤價爲一千三百九十二元、查半日間成交統計六千五百四十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉情況、廠方需要尚稱平席、良以紗銷不旺、所以對原料補償心思極澹、惟同業中鑒於以後來源恐受影響、踢皮球交易日繁也、昨日共計成交外棉九百九十九件、價續升一二元、做開行市如左、美彭家坡二八四·〇同業二九九件</p>

<p>紐約棉市、靜而堅、因有紐奧倫斯及日商買進而略漲、昨日收盤價格、較之上日挺進四至七磅音不等、</p>
<p>印棉亦頗平靜、市况尚屬堅定、昨日連同預測共漲三羅比左右、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、爲小額買賣所支持、漲落一二元不等、大抵因廠方不敢大量採購、各方興趣減低不少、連日同業互做雖覺活潑、但不足言棉市熱鬧前途樂觀也、</p>
<p>印棉又有到埠、太古公司蘇州輪、由香港運來印棉四百五十七件、前日傍晚抵滬停靠、浦東本行碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>

<p>市面亦已平穩</p>
<p>廠布　昨市平穩、客銷因交通窒礙、呆滯不前、惟廠方以成本日增、開價步昂、同業及囤戶態度亦甚鎮定、故市面靜而堅穩、申新廠開出富貴細布價四十四元五角、富貴細斜價三十九元、總額四百餘包、限期四月十五日墊清、市上手貨售價與上日同、別牌細布斜紋漲跌互有、計二角半參差、粗布精斜漂染布價亦平定、本街成交各布三百餘件、粵港幫辦粗布斜紋色布一百餘件、浙閩亦辦近百件、</p>
<p>出口　今日有棉布一千五百四十件、運往香港、又一百十件、運新加坡、又有一百二十五件、運往小呂宋、</p>
<p>派列司現貨缺乏</p>
<p>派列司邇來公茶會上與行號廠方、同業互相拆兌、交易極爲暢旺、號方及囤戶有手貨、來路貨到埠較之去前年減少四分之二五、致該派列斯呢頗見俏俐、昨英製派列斯、每碼齊售三十八九元、東貨普通齊售二十三四元、本廠貨協新五福臨門售二十二元、怡和五福圖十九元半、寅豐財神虎十八元半、華倫財神元寶十六元、</p>

<p>昨糖市因荷蘭電訊、粗白產價見漲、五月份裝船爲美金三·五七五、照C·I·F·例、故公會劃盤、市氣突緊、現貨二四粗白本棧八十七元、升二元、外棧八十六元·六元二角·六元半升一元、三月底打單八十六元、六元三角·六元六角、四月十日打單八十六元五角·八角·七元七元三角、升元許、四月二十日打單八十七元二角·五角·八元升一元、荷赤老貨六十六元八角、新貨六十七元半、元甚上落、太古車白B嘜新貨八十七元半、升五角、老貨八十七元、DY嘜八十二元二角·五角、晶明冰一百十二元、升二元、又糖昨由荷蘭來一萬八千包、</p>

<p>從歷史的觀點上說：環行世界的麥哲倫，率領著西班牙人，於公元一五二一年抵菲律濱羣島：他爲紀念西班牙的太子斐理伯，所以纔稱它爲斐律濱。稍後，於一五六五年，西班牙人將此羣島完全闢爲殖民地。而番薯的渡海入吾中國，正是在萬歷年中，——一五七三至一六一九，——若按福建省志的記載推算，正是一五九五年的事？雖傳聞稍有異辭，而番薯的來自呂宋的這種本證或旁證，總是顛撲不破難以推翻的！</p>
<p>至於廣東電白縣志的記載：「霞洞鄉有番薯林公廟。……相傳番薯出交阯，……以種入中國者罪死！吳川人林懷蘭善醫，薄遊交州，醫其關將有效，因薦醫國王之女，病亦良已。一日，賜食熟番薯，林求食生者，懷半截而出，亟辭歸中國。過關，爲關將所詰，林以實告，且求私縱焉。關將曰：「今日之事，我食君祿，縱之不忠；然感先生德，背之不義！」遂赴水死。林乃歸，種編於粵，今廟祀之。……」既不言林係何時人。而關將的　私縱半截番薯過關竟致投水自盡，也頗帶著神話的色彩。，即使這是千真萬確的事實，也萬難推翻以前番薯傳自呂宋的斷案。，至多可以把它看成分道揚鑣，殊途同歸！　（未完）</p>

<p>— 學慧</p>
<p>謠在今日，風頭獨健。一個謠送掉幾十條性命；一個謠發上幾十萬橫財，都是司空見慣的事。</p>
<p>謠之生，非無因。而其原囚又必為造謠者所竭力渲染；然而謠之成為「事實」，却不是僅為造謠者渲染而已，而是「聽謠者」或「幫謠者」也希望謠之成為事實！</p>
<p>這話怎講，明若觀火：</p>
<p>「風平浪靜」，究　不好賺錢的。造一個謠，起起變動；你也故意把謠當作「事實」，他也故意把謠當作「事實」；道樣金子才會飛漲，白米才會挺高；漲高，於是乎不盡鈔票滾滾來矣。</p>
<p>但是謠終究是謠，雖然造謠者把它當「事實」看，其實心裏也明知是個謠……</p>
<p>那末，謠和造謠者也必有「壽終正寢」的一天！</p>
<h3 id="c103">「不饑丸」 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 陸子胥</p>
<p>『假使能够不飢不餓，那將多好呢！」「唉！米價漲到一百多元一石，那能吃得起呢！」</p>
<p>好在人是「萬能」的，有什麼事不能解決？「不飢不餓」的「神方」居然也有人「發明」了；哦，說錯了，對不起得很，原來還是從古籍里「搜硏」得來的。本月二十日報上不是就登着「一日不飢丸」的廣吿嗎？</p>
<p>據說是華陀仙師的「遺方」，並且還是有鑒目下「百物飛漲，生活日艱」，而特來「救荒濟世」的。所以就打了電話去問了一下，據說，「價格米定」；至於「問世」倒大的在一兩星期後即可「問世」了。呀！只要再過一兩星期就可問世了，那末到那時孤島上的一嚴軍問題不是都能「迎刃而解」嗎？</p>
<p>別的不說，單就要求加貼加薪來說吧，假使到那時候冉根據什麽「我們也要吃飯」的理由提出要求，回答你的不再是「知足常樂」的老調，却是堂而皇之的簇新的「理論」：『現在還要加什麽呢？一日不飢丸小是比米便宜得多嗎？我早替你們打算過了，假使你們肯經常服用此種「神丸」的話，還可以節省些，積蓄些。而况服了之後，又可辟穀延年，更使「飢」骨反健。』（「飢」字直抄廣古）聽這口氣，有米吃的人好像也要「羨慕」吃「不飢丸」的人了。到那時候，凡是薪階級必以「沉着」為妙，吾則恐怕大有「减薪」之希望。</p>
<p>至於那般外國老闆更有話好說了。因為本來「食肉者」與「食穀類者」已有營養上，天賦上，……種種不同，現在冉加上中國人還有「長生不飢丹一，生存上旣多上一種「神仙」的「保障」，拒絕要求起來其埋由之「充足」，一定可以出一本像「百科全書」一樣厚的單行本了</p>
<p>有些人看了「不飢丸」廣吿，不知怎的竟氣憤憤的：簡直狗屁！竟連得我們餓肚皮也成了他們投機的目標。什麼「一日不飢丸」，活了這麽　年紀也沒聽見過，恐怕法幣騙到了，就是你的胃因此脹得像石頭一樣，他們也不會來管你了。」但是登廣吿的人早想到這隻「棋子」，故而聲明在先，原來此丸果有「辟穀延年，飢骨反健」之「神效」，並已「遍贈親友，莫不實騐有效」。不是迎他們的廠名「萬安」好像也在連連喊叫「放心！放心！嗎？實在講來，就是萬一「神效」的出了什麼毛病，結果或許因　蹺了辮子，也不能說這「神丸」不靈騐，除非你相信蹺了辮子的人還會喊：我餓呀！做做好事吧！」</p>
<p>「至於那般知道「神仙遺方」的「善士」，怎麼也要銅鈿呢？』或許有人會這樣的問着。那未登這個廣告的就會大聲疾呼起來：『我們難道不要吃飯嗎？』原來他們自己是不吞「神丸」度日的。</p>
<h3 id="c104">「妙手回春」 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 司馬駿</p>
<p>「妙手回春」是一句稱頌手術高明的外科醫生的贊詞，可是這稱頌像總有些太過份！</p>
<p>形容要形容適當—然而使用形容詞的人，往往是這樣。</p>
<p>昨天經過滬西，在棚戶區的一端，見到一幅「妙手回春」的竹布字。仔細一看，原來是一個走方郎中攤的醫攤，瞧他的樣子，像也有了根基：揚滿了灰塵的「藥瓶」，打針的「針」，吸濃毒的「竹管」，整齊的擺在板上。那老頭兒的郞中，氣宇昂然，有當年「一世之雄」之概。</p>
<p>我看着他的醫術，他在「竹管」內燒了一張黃紙，乘空氣向外壓迫之際，吸住在病人的小肚上，再將「針」打入腿部，於是小肚被吸突的起一塊紅肉，腿上流着鮮紅的血，他對人斷然的說：「毒一定能淸，明天再來看一趟吧！」</p>
<p>但我看到他那種醫術。眞是靈魂都不在家了！</p>
<p>然而這是所謂：一個時代，二個方法，將淘汰的舊式醫術，必有這最後激烈的一番掙扎</p>
<p>其實，這掙扎，更顯出它的沒　底必然性，而「妙手回春」也不過永遠被人作為形容詞運</p>

<p>（五）愛與愆人分野</p>
<p>其實兩個人都沒有看見什麼，他們的兩顆心正像火車上一對飛輪似的不停的在旋轉着，彼此都想不顧一切的向對方傾吐自己的衷曲，但又覺統共祇見了兩面，不應該相知得這樣快，而且一時也不知道應該打什麼地方說起才好。</p>
<p>這糧米街原是城內一處很偏僻的所在，羅家住的又是獨院，屋子裏的人不說話，外面也就一點聲音聽不到，祇剩一陣陣不很遒勁的秋風，在窗外樹梢上吹動着。</p>
<p>「坐着沒有什麼意思，我給你瞧于些東西好不好？」湘綺突然站起來打破了沉寂的空氣說。</p>
<p>秋海棠當然是來不及的說好，但在湘綺沒有把她所說的東西捧出來以前，他却實委猜不到是什麼好玩的東西。</p>
<p>實際上湘綺所取出來的却不是什麽玩物，而是一本小小的照相簿；然而道個倒眞是秋海棠所最受瞧的，同時湘綺也知道他一定愛瞧，因為這上面所貼的幾十張照片，全是她從小到大，二十多年中所留下的各各不同的影子。</p>
<p>秋海棠小心翼翼地接了過去，像賞鑑古物似的一頁一頁的翻看着，每一張像片，至少要耗費他三四分鐘的工夫去端相，嘴裏還要不住的問每張像片拍攝的地點和時期；他覺得這眞是他一生中一個最重大的損失了，因為在湘綺這許多照相中，竟沒餓一張是和他同攝的。</p>
<p>「這是誰啊？」在第六頁上，他發現有一男一女兩個十來歲的小孩子拍在一張照片上，女的那個當然是湘綺，但男的卻不知是誰，便含着很明顯的妒意問。</p>

<p>— 蘇大可</p>
<p>生活的壓榨，不得不終日奔波，微薄的收入，尙不足以溫飽，更談不到如何注　身體的營養了。無調節的勞碌，終於使本來就不大健强的身子日趨衰弱下來；而且，險惡的現象來啦，咳嗽了！在一决强烈的咳嗽後，吐出來的不是痰，而是鮮紅的血。</p>
<p>我呆了，我不相信我生活的苦鬥會有怎樣不幸的遭遇，然而，這不幸的事實巳無情地降臨了。牠不會管你是要養活一個家庭的担負者啊！</p>
<p>母親的焦急，友朋的關切，於是想了法子去到醫生那裹照了照X光。</p>
<p>「你兩個肺尖都有病了！」</p>
<p>「唔……」醫生拿着X光片子沉重地指示着，我像法庭上宣判了死刑一樣的，心向下一沉。</p>
<p>「你的病非長時期休養不可，最好住療養院，好不好？」</p>
<p>「……我經濟不寬，怕不……</p>
<p>「那末……在家里養病，第一要長期的安靜，必須整天臥於空氣流暢，有太陽射人的屋中，絕對不可勞動，……必須要有滋養豐富的飲食，多吃肉類，新鮮菜蔬，新鮮的牛奶和鷄蛋……精神方面必須安定，樂觀，忘懷一切……」</p>
<p>我感激醫生眞誠的囑咐。</p>
<p>躺在黝暗的斗室里，嗅着門縫裏透進來隔壁人家煤爐上的油氣，又引起了咳嗽的發作，想着醫生的囑咐，不禁悵然，不談那有錢人才吃得到的二元多錢一斤的肉，一元多一磅的牛奶，和二毛多一只的鷄蛋，太陽和空氣總是大家的吧？但你沒有錢，你就休想。工作歇退了，一家人生活也無着了，精神怎麼能安靜，怎麼樣忘懷一切！</p>
<p>可憐的年老的母親長嘆了口氣，看看床底下盛米的小木箱又空啦！</p>
<p>並非富貴命，偏生富貴病，唉！</p>

<h3 id="c107">「龍飛鳳舞」 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 胡凡芳</p>
<p>茀雷亞斯坦自從和琴逑羅吉絲分手之後，我就一直替他躭心。因為，再要找一個和琴逑差不多的舞伴，委實不大容易；其决是，此公臉上無戲，如果沒有好的搭擋，成績一定要大為减色。現在這部「龍飛鳳舞」，由寳蓮高黛補琴速的缺，寳蓮的演技和舞姿，和琴逑雖不能相提並論，但仍是茀雷亞斯坦一個理想的搭擋。這大概也就是「龍飛鳳舞」所以還可以一看的原因。</p>
<p>「龍飛鳳舞」與其說是歌舞片，毌寗說是純粹喜劇來得適當些。因為故事是喜劇的地，而演出的形式，更是喜劇化。它寫一個大學樂隊裏的兩個喇叭手，茀雷亞斯坦和梅雷狄斯，追求一個無名樂隊裹的女秘書，寳蓮高黛，全劇故事的發展，都建築在「追求」上面，如樂隊表演時的當塲出彩，以及大富翁和梅雷狄斯飲酒，彼此偷放安眠藥片，以致大家痴睡了一晚等。而最妙的，則是寳蓮的了大富翁到她公寓裏去，給茀雷亞斯坦和梅雷狄斯分頭「釘梢」，大家在床底下碰頭，結果，梅雷狄斯喬裝寳蓮的丈夫，把大富翁嚇退。這些就是所謂好萊的喜劇。</p>
<p>作為本片主角號召觀衆的跳舞塲面，却只有兩個，一個是茀雷和寳蓮合作的「蝶翼舞」，步態新穎別緻，茀雷固然一貫地那麼夭矯風流，寳蓮却也輕盈流利；另一個是全劇最後一個高潮，茀雷以指揮棒指揮樂隊奏曲的舞姿，配合着動聽的音樂，和柔和的燈光，可說是全片最精彩的地方。</p>
<p>總之，好萊塢的喜劇是不能以常理論的，所幸導演者尙能運用他的圓熟的手腕，控制觀衆的情緖。</p>

<p>第四章　燕蹴飛花落舞筵</p>
<p>那女子在馬上做了許多式樣，鑼鼓漸慢，馬到塲中，女子一躍而下。大漢過來，牽住馬，把一對梨花雙刀遞給那女子。女子接在手中，颼颼地使將起來。初時尙見人影，後來一刀緊一刀，變成一團白光，滾東滾西。李信瞧着，幾乎失聲喊起好來。突然之間，那女子就地一滾，早滾到李信許靖二人身前，霍地立起身來，雪亮的雙刀向二人面上一幌。旁邊的人早嚇得倒躱不迭，但是李信和許靖仍舊不動聲色，直挺挺的站在那裹。那女子早又收轉刀，跳回去了。一路刀法使完，　聲也停止了。女子把雙刀丟給一個伙伴，叉着腰，立在塲中，面不紅，氣不喘，祇用一雙流利的眼睛向李許二人這裹瞧來。那大漢端着一個大盤，向衆人說道：「衆位爺，我們這位姑娘吃力了。承蒙諸位讚好，現在請賞賜些錢。我知道這裏杞縣地方的人士素來很慷慨的。」大漢說罷，李信聽了，方才覺得自己錯了，為什麽不早早發話把他們驅走，反而自己也看起來呢？他遂走出來說道：「你們從那裹到此賣解的？可知李家莊的鬥前一向不容有江湖上的人到此賣藝？若要向我李信借些盤纏，倒也可以商量的。你們怎麽偏在此間賣藝，叉將我家人打傷，是何道理？現在倒要起錢來嗎？沒有這麽容易的事罷。」大漢聽了李信的話，又對李信上下一打量，便帶着笑說道：「原來你是李爺，多多失敬。方才我們到此，借莊外的地方暫時賣解一次。不料李爺莊上的莊丁，對我們口出不遜，用武驅逐。我們的姑娘招架時，偶一不慎，傷了莊丁。這雖是我們姑娘的失手，然而尊處莊丁也不免自取其咎。李爺莫怪，我叫姑娘前來和李爺賠罪，好不好？」（二三）</p>

<p>— 耑員</p>
<p>皮黃之能動人聽聞，引起美感者，不僅賴角色之齊整，劇情之緊湊，而樂器之烘染襯托，亦頗佔重要之地位也。</p>
<p>今之皮黃，凡唱腔俱用胡琴，月琴，三絃等以隨和，樂器甚多。曩時托腔皆吹雙笛相和，旣費氣力，行腔轉折，又欠靈活，故當時一切腔調，都以雄厚結實相尙，皆務遒勁直拙，不求婉妙纖巧；嗣後四喜班有王曉韶者，首創廢除吹笛，而代之以胡琴，托襯便覺較前和鬯，深得一般人士讚賞，詎意共同班之田新旺竭力反對，田索强覇，人多憚之，雖知胡琴之創，視吹笛為方便，然不敢開罪於田，乃公議一折衷辦法，凡應堂會時改拉胡琴，平時在班中演唱仍係吹笛。</p>
<p>胡琴對於包腔隨調，因得手法靈活之便，極為動聽，又較吹笛為省力而易與，故學者日衆，各班均相繼採用。田雖力主異，然大勢巳去，亦乏術遏止，舊派吹笛乃益沈寂而終致淹沒無聞矣。</p>
<p>王曉韶所創之胡琴，本係軟弓，苟非腕力强健，不能收效，人多苦之。乃有李四者，另創硬弓胡琴，試之果較為省力而易討好。胡琴經歷數决改革，乃臻完善，於是賈三與樊三（程長庚之琴師）等均改用硬弓，羣稱便利，軟弓胡琴亦如笛子遭天然淘汰矣。祇餘譚鑫培氏初决南下為之操琴之春　班韓明德，仍襲用軟弓，魯殿靈光，祇此一人而已。此後軟弓胡琴即成過去名詞，此胡琴沿革之大概也。</p>

<h3 id="e15">Japanese Newspaper Discusses Singapore; Points Out Several Weaknesses; Oil Depot Vulnerable to Bombing; Food Supply Could Easily Become Difficult <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>A text from the Tokyo Metropolitan News writes an article entitled "Weaknesses of Singapore," and roughly states Singapore naval base has been strengthened, as announced or planned by the British authorities, it is an open question as to whether it can achieve the goal of preventing Japan's southward advance. As a naval base for operations against Japan, Singapore has at least three major weaknesses: 1. Insufficient air defense equipment. Singapore has a large oil depot, as is known, this is a good target for air raids. Once this oil depot is destroyed, the warships preparing for war in the port will be trapped in the port and in danger of not being able to go to war. 2. Insufficient food supply. Asian residents account for nine-tenths of the residents of Malaya, and rice is their main food. Two-thirds of the rice they need comes from Burma and Thailand. Once war with Japan breaks out, Singapore will not be able to obtain this relief, and due to the climate in Malaya, it is almost impossible to store food for more than a few months. 3. Political disturbances caused by food issues. The difficulty in food supply caused by the war can easily lead to political disturbances among the people. It will be extremely difficult to pacify the people's sentiment during the war. (Reuter's dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Coulee and Matsuoka <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Coulee is an American White House senator. Matsuoka is the Japanese Foreign Minister. Coulee, entrusted with a mission from the US President that has not yet been made public, flew to Chongqing, the wartime capital of China, and after close contact with the National Government authorities, quickly returned to Washington. Matsuoka, in his capacity as directly responsible for diplomatic affairs, visited Germany and Italy, and after a long talk of one hour with Soviet leaders in Moscow, arrived in Berlin. Coulee is like a mute, while Matsuoka is himself a chatterbox. How Coulee reported is unknown, although he has repeatedly been surrounded and questioned by reporters from various places, and he has remained tight-lipped, one can imagine how strict he is; however, for more than ten days, the world has had at least three opportunities, obtained indirectly, to glimpse a part of the report: first, the list of military equipment that China needs to borrow from the United States has been submitted to the American authorities; second, the US President has replied that he guarantees to provide China with assistance; these two points obviously originate from Coulee's report; third, Reuter's Washington report said that the contents of Coulee's report were first disclosed in American newspapers yesterday, which is a definite reference. It is said that Coulee said that China's needs are very simple, no more than 20 Flying Fortresses. About 200 new fighter planes, aviation gasoline and steel weapons, as well as artillery and ammunition, in certain quantities; he also said that China would be able to repel Japan with this, so he advocated that the United States should take bold diplomacy towards the Far East; in addition, there are various claims that have not been specifically identified as the contents of Coulee's report, which are detailed in yesterday's newspaper and will not be quoted again. All of this news, of course, makes those who hear it feel comforted and happy. But everything was in reason and expectation, and not a suddenly formed new realm; because American policy is consistent, and it was not designed this way or decided this way based on Coulee's report. Imagining the position of Coulee's report in the entire American policy, it is to collect and provide more and newer arguments for the policy; to add details to the outline, and to deduce plans for the program; to make the consistent policy, by delicate and cautious promotion, boldly let go from now on. This is probably the performance and achievement of Coulee's trip! As for the chatterbox during the long journey, of course, he has complete sets of records for male, female, and even clown roles. How well he can perform and what achievements he will have, it seems too early to estimate at present, but the use of the loudspeaker under a hesitant mood is already obvious at present. When he first started his journey and had not yet left the country, he felt insufficient and dared only admit that the purpose was to conduct an on-the-spot inspection. He wanted the Japanese to be calm and quiet and not have any extravagant hopes, and he fully revealed his lack of confidence and uncertainty. He hummed a tune of peace all the way. He entered Soviet territory from Manzhouli, and until he visited Stoff and Molotov and had a long talk, he did not know it was a long talk and only called it a ceremonial visit. Molotov and his people originally had long talks at every turn. After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had a long talk in Moscow the year before last, the Soviet Union and Germany joined hands; after Molotov had a long talk with Ribbentrop in Berlin last year, it was said that the Soviet Union directly warned Germany against expanding into southeastern Europe; this time, the result of the long Soviet-Japanese talk has not been published, and the world of course has no way of knowing for sure whether Matsuoka was Ribbentrop of Moscow the year before last or the Troff of Berlin last year? Or was it a ceremonial visit for an hour? Leaving Moscow and heading to Berlin; he either did not find it convenient or did not dare, but he also stopped saying the so-called "aimed at conducting an on-the-spot inspection." Not only that, he put away his hesitant attitude; on the train rushing to Berlin, he proudly advised the United States to pay attention to the events in the German and Italian capitals during his visit. Of course, until Liya, no one knew that during Matsuoka's stay in the German and Italian capitals, the German and Italian capitals had an unprecedentedly lively welcome, and Matsuoka was a glorious special guest among them, or that in addition to Hollywood film merchants shooting a colorful newsreel, what kind of events would occur in the German and Italian capitals that would be worth the attention of the United States? What the United States is currently paying attention to is promoting its consistent policy, and after Coulee's report, it may be able to push it forward more boldly! After Matsuoka arrived in Berlin, he published a letter of respect to the German people, expressing the Japanese people's willingness to share the joys and sorrows with Germany and Italy, expressing Japan's loyalty to the Tripartite Pact, wishing Germany victory, and wishing them success in their new order. This is an article of etiquette; listening carefully, it is just an old tune without a new tone. On the same day, the US President signed the military equipment rental fund bill of US$700,000 on a yacht at sea, completing the backbone procedures for promoting a consistent policy. Putting all of these together and comparing them, the mute symbolizes gritting his teeth, advancing in silence, while the opponent's sudden, then proud, although the tendency to return to the mire is a fate that has long been destined, Matsuoka's distant journey is because he is wandering and does not know where to go, and after arriving in Germany and Italy, it is still possible that he will still be wandering, until the return journey goes through Moscow again.</p>

New York's aristocracy and socialites, dazzling in Chinese attire, served as greeters throughout the venue. The banquet featured Chinese cuisine and Chinese-style table settings. The chair of the women's committee for the dinner party was Mrs. Vincent Astor. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>The New York American United Relief for Chinese Refugees General Association's Writers Committee held a banquet tonight at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel to announce the launch of a five-million-dollar fundraising campaign starting on the 3rd of next month. This campaign is jointly organized by seven American aid-China organizations and will cover the entire United States. The hall was adorned with Chinese flags, creating a moving atmosphere. Attendees included nationally renowned writers, artists, New York social leaders, and Chinese expatriates, totaling over a thousand people, a truly grand occasion. Guests included the Chinese Consul-General in New York, Yu Chi-tsun, the American banker [Thomas] Lamont, the famous journalist [Herbert] Gold, the Australian journalist [James] Bertram, and the famous American writer [Nathaniel] Peffer. Republican figure Wendell Willkie, famous female writer Pearl S. Buck, New York Times editor [Ralph] Rukeyser, and the chairman of the Aid China United Association, Mr. [James] Blaine, delivered moving speeches appealing for aid to China. The chairman of the assembly, famous writer [Vincent] Sheean, read telegrams of thanks from Chairman Lin, Generalissimo Chiang [Kai-shek], Madame Chiang [Soong Mei-ling], and President Kong [Hsiang-hsi]. Ambassador Hu Shih sat among the speakers and gave a brief address, expressing his gratitude to the Writers Committee. During his introduction, Sheean strongly argued that the United States should stop supplying goods to Japan. Ambassador Hu Shih announced that the Chinese government had awarded the Blue Jade Medal to Pearl S. Buck. Following this, Willkie delivered a speech, which was his first public statement on the obligations of the United States towards China. All 170 radio stations across the United States broadcast the speech simultaneously. Willkie stated that China is currently fighting for freedom, and he believes that China's great struggle will become one of the decisive battles in humanity's long-term war for freedom and well-being. Willkie deeply admired Generalissimo Chiang's plan to modernize China and the great achievements of the past decade. Willkie continued, saying that this admirable development has been disrupted by Japan's invasion. The achievements of the new China had not yet reached the point of robustness and strength, enough to resist foreign aggression. China was forced to abandon coastal cities and retreat inland, but China never abandoned its ideals. The Chinese people have suffered greatly from bombings, but they remain unmoved. The severity of the bombings they have suffered is arguably more horrific than what the brave people of Britain have endured. China has endured military attacks, and its economic system has been damaged by the capture of vast territories by Japan. However, the honest, straightforward, and peace-loving Chinese people continue to endure everything with a spirit of bravery, unyieldingness, and self-improvement. This has earned the admiration and respect of courageous individuals worldwide. We should help China because what China is resisting is a country colluding with European aggressive nations, with freedom as their target of attack. China is another front in the struggle for freedom. China's goal is the goal of free people. We must help China to preserve their Pacific policy of free people, and nothing else will do. Just as in the Atlantic policy, we should be responsible for assisting China in maintaining a just position. We must resist any country that threatens or attempts to control it. We firmly believe that if the United States and China can build a vast area of freedom and trade, the possibility of war will be smaller than if we fail to achieve this goal. We can provide weapons in large quantities to people who believe in democracy. We can provide relief and assistance. The significance of this fundraising effort lies in letting China know the extent of our enthusiasm and sincerity. We must face the future with a courageous attitude in order to strengthen the democratic system. The people of all countries in the world will demonstrate the ability to be free. We should make them place their hopes in us, maintain our belief in freedom, and we must develop and awaken the minds of more people so that they also believe in freedom and pursue a life of happiness. Pearl S. Buck spoke and urged the United States to give China aid to the same extent and speed as it gives to Britain. It is claimed that China will certainly not be defeated. If it receives our aid, it may even be able to end the war this year. Although China has suffered some losses, its strength has been increasing daily over the past few dangerous years. Generally, people have come to realize that it is China, not Japan, that will occupy an important position in the Far East in the future. We should not adopt an attitude of indifference towards China and focus solely on Britain, because in the same war, China is actually suffering more and for a longer time than Britain. However, the Chinese still hope to befriend us. If we want democracy to be realized in the world, then Britain and the United States must have China coexisting with them. Those who believe that China is a globally relevant country, who gain its friendship, will gain power in the future. Those who lose it will be defeated. For the sake of the future, we really need the Chinese, and at present, they need us. What they need is our relief and all kinds of assistance. (Special Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Japan's Occupation of the Tianjin-Pukou and Shanghai-Nanjing Railways; British MP Urges Government Intervention; Creditors' Interests Must Be Protected; Japan's Demands in Xiamen Are Also Being Addressed <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>London - British MP Milner asked the government in the House of Commons yesterday what measures were being taken to protect the British creditors of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Tianjin-Pukou Railways. These railways were built with British capital and are now managed by Japan, with monthly revenues reaching millions of Japanese yen. Foreign Minister Butler replied that the British government had repeatedly negotiated regarding these railways, requesting that efforts be made to fulfill obligations to British creditors and allowing British railway personnel to perform their duties in accordance with the loan agreement, but so far, no satisfactory results have been obtained, much to his regret. Milner also inquired about the police agreement outside the Shanghai International Settlement. Butler replied that after months of lengthy negotiations, an agreement was signed on February 1st and implemented on March 15th. Although the situation in that area has not been satisfactory in recent months, it is still too early to judge what kind of results the new agreement will produce. MP Hannah inquired about the Japanese demands in Xiamen, asking whether the government had sought to assist foreigners outside the Xiamen Concession by rejecting demands that would allow Japan to control the concession. Butler replied that the Japanese Consul-General in Xiamen made four demands on January 20th, three of which were not difficult to meet. However, the fourth demand required the immediate appointment of six Japanese police officers, causing the three non-Japanese directors to resign, resulting in an insufficient number of directors. Therefore, the duties of the Municipal Council are currently being carried out by the Consular Body. The British Consul, in his capacity as the leading consul, is currently negotiating with the Japanese Consul. Hannah then asked, "Then isn't the current situation extremely unsatisfactory?" The Foreign Minister did not respond to this final question. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Washington - The House Appropriations Committee last night recommended a bill stipulating plans for rivers and harbors, as well as other military and non-military activities, including $34,932,000 in cash and a contractual limit of $79,000,000 to continue the construction of the second set of locks for the Panama Canal. The Governor of the Panama Canal, E. S. Edgerton, told the committee that the auxiliary route for the current locks will be completed in June 1946. (The base for five battleships will also be completed at that time. The National Defense Department stated that it will build North Dakota-class battleships to serve as part of the two-ocean navy.) Edgerton also stated that suitable air force bases should be built on the islands of Galapagos, Cocos, and Albemarle. Since the fortified defenses east of the canal, leased from Britain, are now under construction, similar defensive works have not been approved for the islands west of the canal. The bill also includes an appropriation of $4,670,000 to continue the construction of special protective works, the nature of which is kept secret by the War Department. Edgerton also stated that the Panama Canal has not encountered any sabotage problems. The foreigners employed in the Canal Zone are mostly British, and they are the best workers. If possible, they will be naturalized as American citizens. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>

Republican Congressman Stefan from Nebraska, speaking in the House of Representatives on the Philippines' willingness to cooperate with the United States in banning military supplies to the Axis powers, declared, "I am very grateful for President Quezon's willingness to cooperate. I hope this matter can be implemented immediately." Republican Congressman Crawford from Michigan declared that the United States has used all its means to defend the Philippines and the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, Philippine defense affairs should be a broad cooperation shared with the United States. Philippine figures in Washington are very pleased with this response from Americans to the Philippine President. Although Elizalde did not comment on this issue, he and others expressed great satisfaction with the determined response of senior US officials and members of Congress. US national newspapers have all published Elizalde's statements conveying the Philippine President's views.

<p>Berlin - Hitler received Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka at the Chancellery at 4 PM today. Before Hitler's meeting with Matsuoka, Matsuoka had talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and they reached complete agreement. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka held talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop this morning, lasting several hours. According to official reports, the atmosphere during the talks between Ribbentrop and Matsuoka was extremely harmonious, and opinions were completely一致on all issues related to the cooperation between Germany, Italy, and Japan under the Tripartite Pact. Ribbentrop then hosted a banquet for Matsuoka, with members of the Japanese delegation, officials from the Japanese Embassy, and senior officials from the German Foreign Ministry invited as guests. (Haitong Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London - Sources with the most reliable information have recently stated that Hitler's talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in Berlin seem to have one main purpose: to encourage Japan to advance southward and provoke Japan to go to war with Britain and the United States. It is also claimed that the first topic of the Berlin talks may be Germany's willingness to allow Japan to acquire vast territories, such as the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, Singapore, and Burma, to encourage Japan to attack southward, so that Japan can wage war with Britain and the United States and divert British and American forces in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. This is the first purpose of the German-Japanese talks. Secondly, according to well-informed sources, Matsuoka will definitely ask Germany to use pressure on Moscow to increase the chances of the Soviet Union and Japan concluding a non-aggression pact, so as to消除Japan's doubts about actions against the Soviet Union and allow it to wholeheartedly attack the South Pacific. This is the second purpose of the German-Japanese talks. Thirdly, these sources believe that Hitler may revisit an old matter from 1937 that was not completed and attempt to mediate the Sino-Japanese war again. These sources believe that Hitler may even be able to take such action, because this could enable Japan to concentrate its forces to deal with Britain and the United States. Otherwise, it could at least immobilize a large portion of US forces in the Pacific and prevent them from being transferred elsewhere. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian newspapers this morning devoted extensive coverage to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's visit to Berlin. "Il Popolo d'Italia" believes that the issues to be discussed by Foreign Minister Matsuoka and Axis leaders will include the following four items:</p>
<p>(1) Taking the same actions in European and Far Eastern events based on the spirit of the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>(2) Strengthening cooperation among the signatory countries of the Tripartite Pact. Committees to carry out cooperative matters have now been appointed.</p>
<p>(3) Resisting Britain. "La Stampa" has an article by its reporter interviewing Foreign Minister Matsuoka on a special train. Matsuoka told the reporter that if President Roosevelt wants to involve the United States in the war, Japan must abide by its obligations to the Axis powers. (Haitong Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka arrived here yesterday afternoon. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other Nazi leaders, including representatives from allied countries, welcomed him at the station. The station was decorated with flags and a guard of honor. The German Foreign Minister then accompanied Matsuoka through specially decorated streets to the Bellevue Palace, which is Matsuoka's residence in Berlin. German radio broadcast Matsuoka's remarks to a reporter from the Berlin Angriffe newspaper, stating that Britain and the United States have always opposed Japan's construction work in the Far East. Therefore, Japan has joined the German side. Japan has nothing to ask of the United States and does not disturb its peace, so the United States should follow Japan's example and not disturb Japan's peace in Asia. It is heard that these remarks were made by Matsuoka on the train. According to the German News Agency, Matsuoka addressed the German people last night as follows: "Japan has the courage and determination to establish a new world order, no less than Germany. The most valuable concept for the Japanese, above all else, is found in the phrase 'Hakkō ichiu,' which means that all nations should live in harmony, each in its own place, and all can realize their aspirations and fulfill their missions. This concept is also the foundation of the Tripartite Pact." (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka declared here yesterday that Japan's position is on the same side as Germany, and the United States should pay attention to the progress between East Asia and Berlin. Before arriving in Berlin, Matsuoka advised the United States on the train that it should pay close attention to Berlin and Rome. Later, upon arriving in Berlin, he announced that Germany and Japan would stand together. He reiterated to foreign reporters the facts since Japan's invasion of Manchuria. He said, "At that time, when I returned to Tokyo from Geneva, I knew that Britain and the United States would forever oppose Japan's reconstruction of the Far East. Therefore, our position was isolated, and we stood in the same direction as Germany. I have always adhered to this belief, and I have moved forward courageously until the establishment of the Tripartite Pact." It is noted that Yosuke Matsuoka was originally a Japanese spokesman in 1932. At that time, he announced to the international community in Geneva that Japan had to withdraw from the League of Nations because the League of Nations opposed Japan's conquest of Manchuria. When Matsuoka arrived in Germany this time, he met with reporters when he was about to reach his destination. Matsuoka's advice to the United States was issued on the train.

<p>London - The Ministry of Economic Warfare announced today that during the air raids between Britain and Germany in December last year and January this year, the damage inflicted by the British Air Force within Germany far exceeded the damage caused by Germany to Britain. In the center of Berlin, heavy bombs fell on the Tangze Enster Strasse, penetrating directly into the tunnels. Traffic between the railway station and the Wittenbergplatz was also blocked, and many shops were also damaged. The roof of the Tangze Enster Strasse Cinema was also blown off, and the damage was extensive. Therefore, even though the German rescue teams were very efficient, it took ten days to clear the area. The most important railway junction between the Berlin Schöneberg Station and the Tauentzienstrasse was also hit. The main police station and court in Berlin were also damaged. The top floor of the famous Wertheim department store was burned, and industrial facilities were also slightly damaged. When Mannheim was attacked, the main dockyards suffered extensive damage, resulting in some ships being sunk. Several chemical factories in Mannheim were also damaged. It is believed that this will cause difficulties for Germany's chemical industry. Several main warehouses in Mannheim were also hit. The central military post office for the German forces occupying France was also directly hit. A train carrying ammunition was also hit, and the neighboring houses were affected. After the attack on Mannheim, it could not return to its normal industrial state for at least several weeks. The Ministry of Economic Warfare explained that the reason for the delayed release of information about the British Air Force's achievements was due to some difficulties in collecting the facts and the desire to protect the sources of information. Details of the British attacks on Wilhelmshaven and Kiel will be released soon. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>London - Chancellor of the Exchequer [Kingsley] Wood broadcast last night that the newly formulated War Damage Act forces people to insure their property. If it is damaged, they can get limited compensation. According to this plan, every British household has become a fortress. This plan applies to everyone. Not only can they be compensated for actual damage, but also for damage caused by air raids, such as bomb craters in the roof and rainwater flowing in, causing damage. People who have already suffered losses can also apply for compensation under this plan. The War Damage Act is an important part of the British response to [Franklin D.] Roosevelt's policy, and the British Air Force's flight to Germany also gives Hitler a response, making him feel even more embarrassed.

<h3 id="e36">Only Two Days After Joining the Axis, Yugoslavia Experiences a Coup; Young King Peter II Takes Over National Affairs; General Simović Organizes a New Cabinet <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Belgrade, today at 2:30 AM: Following a bloodless coup in the Yugoslav capital, young King Peter II has taken control of the government and appointed Army General Simović to lead the nation. It is reported that Prime Minister Cvetković, who signed the Axis pact in Vienna, has been arrested, and Prince Regent Paul has fled the country. Other cabinet members are also said to be detained. After taking action, the King issued a proclamation to the nation, according to a broadcast from a Hungarian radio station. The proclamation reads as follows: "At this most critical time in our nation's history, I have decided to reclaim the royal powers. All members of the Regency Council agree with the correctness of my actions and have immediately offered their resignations. The army and navy are under my command and have implemented my orders. I now appeal to the people of Serbia, Croatia, and Slovenia to support the royal family in this moment of grave crisis, as it is the most certain way to maintain internal order and external peace. I have appointed General Simović to take responsibility for organizing a new government. I hope that the entire nation will support it. I trust in God and the future of Yugoslavia. I urge all citizens and national authorities to fulfill their duties to the King and the country." It is reported that Prince Paul's wife also left the country with him. There is no news yet on the situation in the various provinces of Yugoslavia. The new Yugoslav cabinet includes leaders and representatives from various political parties and all levels of society. The main cabinet members are: Prime Minister Simović (Serbia), Deputy Prime Minister Maček (Croatia), and Foreign Minister Ninčić (Slovenia). At midnight, the Yugoslav capital appeared calm on the surface, and the local demonstrations were suppressed by several squads of police, whose actions were quite reasonable. The most important demonstration on Wednesday took place outside the Soviet embassy, with the crowd shouting "Long live Britain, long live the Soviet Union, down with Hitler, down with Mussolini."</p>
<p>Appealing to the People for Support, Defending Independence and Integrity</p>
<p>Peter II later issued a declaration stating that at this critical juncture for the nation's survival, he has reclaimed all power and is ruling personally. The army and navy have been ordered to maintain order and peace. He hopes that all people throughout the country will remain calm in their professions. Both of the above declarations were signed by Peter II himself. The administration of the province of Belgrade has been taken over by the military authorities. General Stefanović has been appointed as the military governor of the province. General Stefanović issued a notice calling on the people to support the army and prepare to defend the independence and integrity of the country. The army has sworn allegiance to the new Minister of the Army, General Ilić. Reserve officers have sent telegrams to the King expressing their loyalty and readiness to serve the King at any time.

<p>The leader of the Slovak people in the Yugoslav capital has joined the new government as a minister without portfolio. According to a semi-official statement issued here this afternoon, the people of China have unanimously expressed their inability to tolerate tyranny in the past few days, and therefore they demand the organization of a national government to reflect this desire. The above is the meaning and scope of today's government change. The statement also stated that this decision to change the government is purely an internal policy and has nothing to do with foreign policy. According to reports, South Korea only joined the alliance on the 25th of this month. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill's Speech: Promising Full Assistance to Yugoslavia British Prime Minister Churchill gave a speech here this morning, promising full assistance to Yugoslavia. The Prime Minister delivered this speech at the Central Council of the Conservative and Unionist Associations. The first part of the speech mentioned his predecessor and cabinet members, and then referred to Yugoslavia, stating, in brief, that he has important news to report to you and the nation. This morning, the people of Yugoslavia discovered their soul. A revolution has taken place in the South Korean capital. All cabinet members who signed the treaty yesterday selling their country's honor and freedom are said to have been arrested. This patriotic action was sparked by the weakness and incompetence of the country's rulers and the conspiracies of the Axis powers. Based on the news received so far, the people of South Korea may have a hope that a new government can be established to defend the freedom and integrity of their country. This government has made this brave effort, and will naturally receive all possible assistance and relief from the British Empire. He believes that the United States will also do the same. The British Empire and the Allied Powers will fight together with the people of Yugoslavia. We will continue to move forward and work together to achieve final victory. When the Prime Minister mentioned the current war and the peace, he expressed his hope that the whole country would be united on peace matters. The Prime Minister continued, that he has great confidence in the future. Since Dunkirk, the Allied Powers have won many victories, needless to say. In addition, there is one thing that is more important than victory, and that is the revitalization of the great American national spirit and its closer cooperation with the common doctrine. The Prime Minister also warned the people of the country that the difficulties have not ended, and the war in the Atlantic must be won so that food supplies, military supplies, and various American aids can be continuously delivered. He dares to assert that within a few months, Britain will be able to achieve a decisive victory. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Sudden Change in the European Situation: Berlin Suffers a Blow</p>
<p>London, Reuters Diplomatic Correspondent reports: The surprising developments in the Yugoslav capital have suddenly and completely changed the European situation. Cvetković and all the cabinet members responsible for signing the Tripartite Pact have been removed from office. What is even more important is the total resignation of the Regency Council and the assumption of full responsibility by King Peter, who is only seventeen and a half years old, in this grave crisis. General Simović, who was appointed to organize the new government, is a Serbian and was formerly the Chief of the General Staff. He is currently the commander of the Serbian Air Force and is known as a first-class military man. He has never participated in politics. The statement in the South Korean King's declaration that the army and navy have carried out his orders is of great significance, because the South Korean army has in fact been fully mobilized. The recent developments should be a major blow to Berlin's complacency. These developments also happened suddenly as Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived in Berlin, allowing him to see Germany's reaction to this unexpected situation as soon as possible. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Well-informed sources in London all believe that the coup in Yugoslavia is a surprising reversal of diplomatic tides, which is detrimental to the Axis powers. This is the first major political failure Germany has suffered on the continent. One diplomat said that this is like a painful blow to Hitler's face, and even though Foreign Minister Matsuoka is in Berlin, it cannot reduce the pain. This coup in Yugoslavia is indeed well-timed, as the German army is about to launch an attack on Greece, not only feeling safe on the flank, but also able to use the corridor of Yugoslavia when necessary. At present, both of these hopes have become a bubble. Germany's Balkan strategy must be thoroughly revised. Yugoslavia's lack of weakness has long been proven in history. Young King Peter II is obviously prepared to follow in the heroic tradition of his late King Alexander. The new Deputy Prime Minister Maček is the leader of the Croatian people. Although he also participated in the signing of the Axis Pact, he does not agree to surrender to Germany. This can be seen from his continued appointment. Another Deputy Prime Minister, Jovanović, is a famous jurist who advised Prince Paul's government to oppose the Axis Pact before signing it. The attitude of the Yugoslav people is very pro-. The people of the country are very welcome. New Foreign Minister Ninčić</p>

<p>Officials in Rome, Italy, learned of the coup in the South Korean capital this morning from the Hungarian radio station, but did not obtain detailed information, so they could not speculate on the new situation. However, the railway and telephone lines between Italy and South Korea are currently cut off, and it was also impossible to receive telegrams from the Italian embassy in South Korea this morning. Therefore, officials in South Korea refused to express their views on the new situation. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)</p>

<p>Budapest, yesterday, there were large-scale demonstrations on the streets of the South Korean capital, expressing the people's opposition to the country's accession to the Axis Pact. Students walked arm in arm in formation, singing national anthems and patriotic songs. Fierce quarrels broke out among the audience, with some exchanging punches. Plainclothes police stationed throughout the city immediately intervened and arrested several people. All schoolchildren in various schools in the South Korean capital participated in the demonstrations. The schools also burned pictures of Hitler, and pictures of the young King Peter of South Korea were decorated with red flowers. More serious riots broke out in Banja Luka, with fourteen people dying violently. Riots also broke out in Koplürci on Tuesday night and yesterday morning. The telephone lines to the national capital were all cut off yesterday. According to news from New York, there were continuing demonstrations in the South Korean capital and other places last night. Demonstrators in the capital demanded that South Korea reach an understanding with the Soviet Union. The police repeatedly tried to restore order. It is also reported that there were demonstrations in Sarajevo and other cities in South Korea. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<p>New York, yesterday afternoon, Foreign Minister Butler revealed in the House of Commons the contents of Britain's final note to the South Korean government before South Korea joined the Axis Pact. It is said that when South Korea was about to sign the pact, British Minister to South Korea Campbell sent a note to the South Korean government stating that Britain originally believed that South Korea would not take any action to harm the Allied Powers, because the purpose of the Allied Powers is also the purpose approved by the people of South Korea. Therefore, the British government is shocked to hear that South Korea is now suddenly planning to sign an agreement that not only abandons its neutral attitude, but also clearly joins the enemy of Britain. The British government cannot but point out that, judging from recent history, if such an agreement is concluded, the people of South Korea will inevitably become more and more deeply trapped in the enemy's system. The history of the past eighteen months has clearly shown that Germany has no respect for its guarantees. Butler continued, the consequences of the South Korean government's decision to join the Axis should be borne entirely by the South Korean government. When asked whether the military supplies were prevented from passing through South Korea in addition to the military issue, Butler replied that this matter was not included in the German Foreign Minister's letter. Foreign Minister replied to another question stating that there is currently a suggestion from the British side to continue stationing diplomatic representatives in Hungary. The matter of stationing diplomatic representatives in a country must be considered for its value. As for Hungary, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. When asked "Does this also apply to the South Korean capital?", Butler's response was inaudible. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>London, Emelie, the Secretary of State for India and Burma, broadcast a moving appeal to the people of South Korea last night. It is said that the people of South Korea should maintain the survival of their national spirit. It is not too late now. Before approving the pact, the South Korean government should consult with the people. The people regard the signing of this pact as a betrayal of honor and independence. Britain will surely win victory. What position will South Korea be in at that time? The United Kingdom and the United States are working together with one heart and one mind, which Hitler cannot resist. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

It was revealed that an enemy oil tanker was sunk by a British submarine off the coast of Norway. The above announcement came immediately after this news. The Admiralty stated that in recent weeks, several German torpedo boats have been heavily damaged after being violently attacked by the British Navy, and it is feared that they will not be able to return to their base. It is said that the British ship was not damaged. Well-informed sources said that the German submarine base in Loriente, on the west coast of France, is no longer usable after being heavily bombed by the British Air Force. German submarines are withdrawing from the area and moving to a new base on the northwest coast of Africa. It is alleged that if the non-coastal base is occupied by Germany, it will be greatly beneficial for Germany to attack Britain's Atlantic lifeline for transporting military supplies from the United States. It was hinted here today that France has signed a secret agreement with Germany allowing Germany to use the ports of French Africa. (International News Agency, 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Reflections on the European War (4) (2): A Reckoning of the Western Front <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper has published several translated articles about the course of the war on the Western Front, such as reports and diaries from British, French, and American journalists and officers, all of which are modern, reliable historical records. However, the writings of each of these figures offer an observation from a single perspective. The American magazine "Life" has now compiled a special article, which is translated below as a conclusion to this period of war history for the study of those who are concerned with military matters:</p>
<p>In May of last year, the German army defeated the Netherlands, Belgium, and France in six weeks. At the time, the blitzkrieg was generally regarded as a unique and completely new tactic. In fact, the German army based itself on military principles passed down for hundreds of years, but applied them in a new way. Now that ten months have passed, this glorious and unprecedented military achievement can be analyzed clearly with a calm mind. This article is based on top-secret information from the highest military authorities of the German and Allied forces.</p>
<p>Since the last World War, the Allied forces had made a major mistake in thinking that it was normal for the two armies to dig deep trenches and build high ramparts when fighting, resulting in a stalemate. But this was not the case. The last European war was an abnormal and special situation. At that time, perhaps the progress of automatic weapons and firepower temporarily exceeded the ability of the infantry to advance, which created this exception. The German General Staff always believed that only by taking the offensive could victory be achieved, and that defensive fortifications were by no means impenetrable.</p>
<p>The French army maintained the Maginot Line, built at a cost of one million dollars per mile, stretching from the Alps to Sedan on the Franco-Belgian border, and thus believed itself to be impregnable. As for protecting the northern flank, until 1936, it relied on a line from the Belgian town of Lanwe to Maastricht, then along the Albert Canal to Antwerp. In addition, Belgium built an auxiliary line from Sedan along the Meuse River to Namur, then along the Dyle River to Antwerp, where it connected with the Albert Canal line. In 1936, Belgium changed its policy, withdrew from the Anglo-French alliance, and declared "strict neutrality." France then hastily built a "Little Maginot Line" from Sedan to the English Channel, along the Belgian border.</p>
<p>It is now known that before launching its offensive in May of last year, Germany mobilized six to seven million troops, organized into two hundred and forty divisions, plus other necessary auxiliary units. No fewer than one hundred and fifty German divisions were concentrated on the Franco-Belgian border. As for the Allied forces, France had one hundred and fifteen divisions, Britain sent only ten divisions, Belgium had sixteen to twenty divisions, and the Netherlands had fourteen divisions.</p>
<p>The German offensive strategy was extremely cunning. In 1914, the German army followed the Schlieffen Plan, using Metz as the central axis of attack, strengthening the right wing as much as possible, and attacking through Belgium in a wide flanking maneuver. This time, the German army pretended to still be advancing according to this plan, but in reality, it used Sedan as the central axis of attack, concentrating its forces in an attempt to break through a single point in the vicinity.</p>
<p>In order to mislead the British and French forces and lure the enemy deep into Belgian territory, Germany first attacked the Netherlands in the north to draw the British and French forces into Belgium. In fact, of the one hundred and fifty German divisions, only six or seven were used to deal with the fourteen Dutch divisions.</p>
<p>The German army attacked the Netherlands at 3:20 a.m. on May 10. Unorthodox tactics were used to the fullest extent, and new facts emerged one after another. The so-called "vertical envelopment" strategy was used for the first time in history and was a complete success. Infantry was transported by aircraft, and in very large numbers, which had a decisive impact on tactical deployment and was unprecedented. The Dutch army was well-trained, well-commanded, and well-equipped with good morale, but the German army was able to defeat the enemy with fewer troops in a few days. This was entirely due to the proper use of the air force, paratroopers (i.e., airborne marines), and the Fifth Column. The German army also identified two weaknesses in the Dutch defenses: one near Hettchen-bao-xu on the south bank of the Maas River, and the other further south between the Peel-Raam Line and the North Holland position. However, this offensive was only an auxiliary to the invasion of Belgium, so the German army sought to reduce the cost. Advancing along the southern border of the Netherlands, crossing the three major bridges at Rotterdam, Dordrecht, and Moerdijk, and heading straight for the Dutch heartland, was the cheapest route. To prevent the Dutch army from destroying these many bridges, the German army used paratroopers and the Fifth Column. The total number of Germans and Dutch Nazis in the Netherlands was no fewer than 100,000, and they had all received detailed instructions on how to carry out this task.</p>
<p>At the same time, German seaplanes landed on the Maas River in Rotterdam. The German troops in the planes rowed to the small islands in the middle of the river in rubber dinghies and coordinated with the well-armed Fifth Column, first driving away the Dutch soldiers guarding the important bridge in Rotterdam. A barracks nearby housing a specially trained paratrooper defense team was also bombed, causing heavy casualties to the Dutch army. German bombers also surrounded the Waalhaven Rotterdam Airport, bombed several hangars, and paratroopers descended from the sky, using the fire wall as cover to clear the Dutch army from the airfield and remove various obstacles preventing German aircraft from landing. In an instant, huge German transport planes landed at Waalhaven carrying airborne marines. (To be continued)</p>
<p>British Aircraft Active in Africa; Corrente Bombed Heavily; General de Gaulle Reportedly Making Large-Scale Military Preparations in West Africa</p>
<p>The British Air Force Command in Cairo issued a communiqué yesterday stating that on Tuesday, the British Air Force repeatedly attacked enemy positions in Eritrea and Abyssinia, assisting the British Army in its operations. Corrente in Eritrea was attacked repeatedly that day, and several tons of bombs were dropped. The railway from the Abyssinian capital to Dire Dawa was also heavily bombed, and railway stations and bridges were damaged. Motor transport vehicles on the roads were also bombed and strafed. The Free French Air Force bombed an enemy camp 20 miles north of Gondar (northern Abyssinia), and bombs hit buildings and transport vehicles. Two enemy airfields on Rhodes and enemy ships near Astypalaia Island (Dodecanese Islands) were also heavily bombed and strafed. Several German aircraft in the airfields were heavily damaged, and a merchant ship was also hit. In addition, enemy aircraft dive-bombed the port of Malta, causing no casualties, only slight damage to civilian houses. A Junkers Ju 88 German aircraft was shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and several other enemy aircraft were also damaged. All British aircraft that went out on missions returned safely.

<p>According to a dispatch from Brazzaville, French Equatorial Africa, under the administration of the Free French forces, received in the Swedish capital, General de Gaulle is now in French Equatorial Africa. A week ago, his plane arrived in Gibraltar. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>According to information received here in Lisbon, General de Gaulle is conducting large-scale military preparations in the Free City of West Africa, possibly to attack Dakar or other locations. (Haitong News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Greece Declares Fight to the End; Greek King Thanks British King</p>
<p>Athens: A semi-official communiqué was issued here today. We recognize the news spread by the Nazis that Greece is preparing to join peace negotiations and state that we vehemently reject any proposal for peace negotiations and declare that we will resolutely fight to the end. (Reuter, 27th)</p>
<p>Athens: On the Greek Independence Day, King George VI of England sent words of encouragement. Yesterday, King George II of Greece especially thanked the British King. King George of Greece said, "At a time when Greece is fighting for freedom and survival, this moving expression is a valuable inspiration to the Greek people and army, who have confidence in the final victory and are fighting shoulder to shoulder with noble and brave allies against the aggressors." On Tuesday, the Greek army attacked the Italian army with heavy artillery to celebrate Independence Day. After the battle, comrades laid the foundation for a new church, vowing to donate 130,000 Greek drachmas to help build the church for the soldiers who died for freedom. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>No Troops Sent Overseas</p>
<p>Cape Town: During a session of the South African Parliament yesterday, the question of using South African troops outside of Africa was raised. South African Prime Minister General Smuts said that the government intends to strictly abide by the resolution passed by Parliament at the beginning of the war, which prohibits sending troops overseas. If circumstances arise in which the government believes it is necessary to send troops overseas, the government will convene Parliament to discuss the matter. The government has the right to use its forces anywhere in Africa. Currently, no South African troops are fighting in Greece or anywhere outside of Africa. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Massive Amounts of American War Material to be Shipped to Britain; 80,000 Aircraft to be Completed; President Signs Lend-Lease Funding Bill</p>
<p>On the destroyer USS Benson, President Roosevelt signed the $7 billion Lend-Lease funding bill today on his yacht Potomac (off the coast of Florida). The continuous transport of ships, aircraft, tanks, artillery, food, etc., to Britain can now begin. The funding bill was carried by military aircraft from Washington D.C. to the President's ship. Now that it has been signed, the United States can mobilize large sums of money to create a "great arsenal for democratic nations." Defense officials are working hard on a plan to complete 80,000 aircraft by the summer of 1943, plus a large number of merchant ships and armaments, the scale of which was unimaginable months ago. This funding is specifically for the Lend-Lease Act and is not the same as the huge supplementary naval and land army funding that Congress passes from time to time. (Associated Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington: General White, an air force expert on the Senate Military Affairs Committee, declared today that the United States can train 30,000 pilots annually beginning in 1942. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Shanghai Municipal Council Election Issue: Mediation by British, American, and Japanese Consuls; If Successfully Resolved, No Further Elections Will Be Held; Council Appoints Ballot Counters and Collectors <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Regarding this year's Municipal Council election issue, it is heard that the consuls-general of Britain, the United States, and Japan are currently holding talks. The result of the election is expected to be resolved before it is held on April 9th and 10th. It is generally believed that if the talks between the consuls-general conclude satisfactorily, there will be no election this year. However, the progress of the talks is not known in detail. Only relevant parties tacitly acknowledge that meetings have been held continuously. It is heard that the current talks between the three consuls-general are the result of preliminary negotiations by the British and Japanese residents' election committees aimed at reaching a "gentleman's agreement."</p>
<p>American Residents Aim to Maintain Rights</p>
<p>Mr. Mills, chairman of the American Residents Association and this year's American council candidate, stated yesterday morning (the 27th) that he cannot make any statement at this time, but the American Residents Association is doing its utmost to maintain the rights of Americans in Shanghai. Some people believe that there will be changes in the proportion of Municipal Council members this year, and the nine council seats may be divided equally among the British, American, and Japanese representatives.</p>
<p>British, American, and Japanese Consuls Discussing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that there have been many rumors recently about the outcome of the negotiations between the representatives of the British, American, and Japanese residents regarding the Municipal Council election. However, according to a reliable source yesterday (the 26th), this matter has completely left the control of the British, American, and Japanese residents' committees. How the nine Municipal Council seats should be distributed among the residents of the three countries is now entirely in the hands of the British, American, and Japanese consuls-general in Shanghai. It is heard that British Consul-General George, American Consul-General Lockhart, and Japanese Consul-General Horiuchi have been discussing this point for days. The reason why a postponement of the Municipal Council's annual election was specifically requested was to give the three consuls-general an opportunity to reach a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>Gentleman's Agreement Has No Basis</p>
<p>Since 1936, Japanese residents have attempted to reduce one British or American council seat during the Municipal Council's annual election every April, so that the number of Japanese council seats could be increased to three. But they have never succeeded. Now that this year's election is approaching, the Japanese residents have this intention again. Yesterday, it was heard from responsible parties that the rumors circulating that British and Japanese residents' representatives are currently holding discussions and are expected to reach a "gentleman's agreement," so that the number of Japanese council seats can be increased to three, the number of British council seats can be reduced to four, and the number of American council seats will remain at two, are unfounded. The entire issue of the International Settlement has been handed over to the three consuls, and the three consuls-general, after requesting instructions from their respective governments, may reach an appropriate solution.</p>
<p>Ballot Counting and Collection: Personnel Assigned</p>
<p>The date of the Municipal Council's annual election has been postponed to April 9th and 10th, and the deadline for the registration of candidates has also been extended to noon on April 1st. It was also announced yesterday that the Municipal Council has appointed Mr. Blunt and Mr. Bollinger as ballot counters for the election of directors and land committee members, and Mr. Middleton and Mr. Crammerly as ballot collectors, and has obtained the agreement of all four individuals.</p>
<p>Electoral Roll: Corrections Completed</p>
<p>Municipal Council Public Notice No. 5414 states that the final electoral roll compiled by the Council in accordance with Article 19 of the Yangjing Land Regulations has been corrected by March 2nd in accordance with Public Notice No. 5394 published by the Council on February 7, 1941. It is now posted at the Reception Room of the Municipal Council at No. 209 Jiangxi Road and at various police stations. All taxpayers can go there to consult it. Foreign consulates, foreign organizations, and general associations can apply to the Revenue Office at No. 209 Jiangxi Road if they wish to obtain a copy.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Day. All circles in Shanghai will lower flags to half-mast and mourn solemnly, in accordance with the measures agreed upon by various public organizations and the authorities of the concessions. All agencies, parks, and schools will also be closed as usual. Citizens will also voluntarily stop entertainment and banquets and eat vegetarian food for one day to express their condolences. In order to actively commemorate this revolutionary festival, all circles have decided to continue the movement to encourage thrift and donate money to purchase bonds, and to emulate the indomitable spirit of the revolutionary martyrs, work hard in their respective positions, and support national policies in order to complete the great task of national rejuvenation. In order to prevent troublemakers from taking the opportunity to cause trouble, the concession authorities have implemented precautions in advance, prohibiting improper gatherings and associations, and have strengthened inspections of pedestrians and vehicles in recent days. Tomorrow, they will further tighten security to maintain order.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Water Supply: Another Price Increase Requested <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company just increased the water surcharge from 50 percent to 110 percent in June of last year. Now the company has asked the Municipal Council to increase consumption again. If the Municipal Council agrees, the water bill will soon increase significantly again. Yesterday (the 27th) at noon, at the annual shareholders' meeting of the Shanghai Waterworks Company, Chairman Liddell said in his speech that the company is currently applying to the Municipal Council to review the situation disclosed in the company's budget figures for this year, and the increase in water bills can no longer be delayed, which is regrettable. Liddell also said that the company's profits are less than before, which is insufficient to pay dividends.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Detailed Measures for Reducing Electricity and Water Consumption: Committee to be Organized for Discussion; French Municipal Council Reportedly Approves <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>According to news received yesterday, the French Municipal Council will issue a public notice next Tuesday (April 1st) regarding the Shanghai Electricity and Water Company's request to reduce the supply of electricity and water. The Shanghai Electricity and Water Company first submitted the company's proposal to reduce the supply of electricity and water to the Public Works Department of the International Settlement. The Public Works Department immediately approved it in principle and sent this plan to the French Municipal Council for consideration. It is generally believed that the French Municipal Council has approved this proposal. As for the detailed measures for reducing consumption, they will be discussed jointly by the joint committee organized by the authorities of the two concessions and representatives of the Shanghai Electricity and Water Company. To what extent the supply of electricity and water will be reduced by the two concessions is still unknown. Officials of the Electricity and Water Company are also unwilling to comment on this issue before it is approved by the authorities.</p>

<p>The four banks, namely Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank, have been instructed by the Ministry of Finance to continue their operations in Shanghai and its branches, upholding the spirit of serving society and maintaining Shanghai's financial stability. The Central Bank and the Shanghai branch of the Farmers Bank of China have received instructions from their head offices to prepare for resuming business. Authorities in the Public Concession and the French Concession, as well as the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, have exerted their utmost efforts to protect all banks. The four banks have vehemently denounced market rumors as unfounded and hope that citizens will not be misled by them. As for the overall financial situation, it remains as stable as ever.</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Various Banks; Scheduled Resumption of Operations</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from various banks yesterday that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank on Avenue Joffre and the office on Avenue Petain have hired workers to rush repairs since the bombing. At the same time, they are reorganizing internally and plan to resume business on the 31st of this month. During this temporary suspension period, all employees will continue to work internally as usual. The Shanghai branch of the Farmers Bank of China on Avenue Dubail and the office on Rue Amiral Bayle have already deployed comprehensive prevention measures. If conditions permit, they will resume business on Friday; otherwise, they will resume business on the 31st. The Shanghai branch of Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank at 539 Avenue Dubail and the exchange office at 1182 have recently installed iron gates and will resume business as soon as the work is completed.</p>
<p>Armed Detectives Intensify Protection</p>
<p>The Shanghai branches of the Bank of China and the Communications Bank, as well as various offices in the concessions, have been guarded by armed detectives dispatched by the concession authorities, with strict vigilance. Those within the U.S. military defense zone are also guarded by armed U.S. Marines. As for government-commercial joint venture banks such as China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, the Bank of the Four Provinces, the China National Products Bank, and the China Industrial Bank, as well as provincial banks such as Jiangsu Provincial Bank, Zhejiang Provincial Bank, and Jiangxi Yumin Bank, and major commercial banks, detectives and business corps have also been dispatched to guard and protect them. In short, the authorities of the two concessions are determined to exert their full efforts to protect the operations of all banks within their jurisdiction. At the same time, all these banks have made considerable preparations for preventive measures to maintain the safety of employees and merchants and depositors who collect and remit funds.</p>
<p>Bombed Securities Undergoing Verification</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch office of the Central Bank on Avenue Petain was bombed this time, and it is reported that securities exchanged between the bank and its counterparts were destroyed. In addition to verifying with other banks and money shops, the bank has also declared that any of these destroyed securities subsequently discovered will be invalid. The bank will resume business and resume collecting and remitting funds as soon as the destroyed securities are sorted out and the repairs to the bombed building are completed. Securities issued during the temporary suspension period will be collected and remitted on the day of resumption of business. During this suspension period, the exchange of bank securities at the securities exchange will be temporarily suspended in accordance with past holiday practices.</p>
<p>Bereaved Employees Receive Generous Compensation</p>
<p>Regarding the aftermath of the employees of the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank who were killed or injured in the bombing, and the employees of the Shanghai branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank who were killed or injured in the bombing, in addition to the respective bank authorities assuming all medical expenses and funeral expenses, they have requested the head office to provide generous compensation to the deceased and pay the salaries of the injured during their medical treatment period. It is reported that the Chinese government deeply mourns the employees who were loyal to their duties and died in the line of duty and has instructed the bank authorities to provide generous compensation to comfort their loyalty. The employees of the four Shanghai branches who have worked hard and persevered are highly commended.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Shanghai Municipal Council Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Facilitating Rice Transport; Will Contact Shipping Industry to Allocate Vessels Appropriately; Market Rumors Re-emerge, Rice Prices Rebound <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>According to sources with inside information, the Shanghai Municipal Council held a special board meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of people's livelihood. The meeting discussed in detail how to facilitate the transport of rice from abroad to Shanghai by ships. Although the details of the discussion are not available, it is widely believed that the Shanghai Municipal Council will contact the relevant shipping authorities. In addition to discussing the issue of ships, the meeting also studied the report recently submitted to the council by the Food Commission. Shipping industry sources told reporters yesterday that more than 200,000 bags of rice will be shipped from Southeast Asia to Shanghai in the next ten days.</p>
<p>Manipulation of the Black Market</p>
<p>After rice prices fell for several consecutive days, they suddenly rebounded yesterday, with black market prices rising by three to four yuan per picul. Given the abundant supply of foreign rice and the decline in gold prices, there is no reason for prices to rebound again.</p>
<p>Rice-Grabbing Craze</p>
<p>Since rice prices have risen continuously, rice-grabbing incidents have occurred from time to time. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, a handcart carrying two bags of rice on Race Course Road near Yu Qiaqing Road was being pushed forward by a driver when more than a dozen impoverished people suddenly rushed out of an alley, slashed open the sacks with small knives, and snatched away more than one picul of rice using cloth bags. By the time the police arrived, they had scattered in a commotion. It is reported that similar incidents have occurred elsewhere.</p>

<p>It was reported in a previous issue that two world-class passenger liners of the American President Lines, the President Jackson and the President Grant, arrived in Shanghai together the day before yesterday (the 26th). The President Jackson departed from Shanghai yesterday morning at the scheduled time, heading to various ports in Southeast Asia, passing through Bombay and the Cape of Good Hope, and returning to the United States. The President Grant, another world-class liner, was originally scheduled to depart at noon yesterday and return to the United States along the scheduled route. It is now learned that the ship was delayed by twelve hours due to congestion of export cargo and departed at midnight last night. Among the American nationals traveling from Shanghai to Southeast Asia and returning to the United States on the two passenger liners, twenty-seven were on the President Jackson, and seventy-one were on the President Grant, all in first-class cabins. It is reported that the first world-class new passenger liner, the President Hayes, set sail from Boston at the beginning of this month on its maiden voyage eastward and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-next month.</p>
<p>Distinguished Visitors</p>
<p>Among the passengers departing from Shanghai on the President Grant yesterday were Baron Guillaume, the Belgian ambassador to China, and the wife and two children of Mr. Keswick, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The President Grant arrived here from the United States via Japan, and only nine passengers disembarked, including the British Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Pester, and his wife, who returned to Shanghai after their vacation, Captain Strickland, a naval dental officer of the U.S. Marine Corps who came to Shanghai to join the 4th Marine Regiment, Mr. Woodfield, head of the River Police of the Jianghai Customs, who returned to Shanghai after traveling in the United States, and Mr. and Mrs. Pokka, the secretary of the Italian air force attaché stationed in Japan. Among the passengers on the ship passing through Shanghai were Mr. Yancey, the U.S. Consul in Shantou, who was returning to his post, and several U.S. Navy personnel who were going to Manila to serve in the Asiatic Fleet. Among the passengers departing from Shanghai on the President Jackson were Mr. and Mrs. Pryke, the Swiss Commercial Commissioner in Shanghai, and their two daughters.</p>

<p>After the labor unrest at the French-owned water and electricity company, work was resumed yesterday. The two sides were originally scheduled to negotiate the issue of improving treatment for the labor side at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. However, due to the need for the labor side to discuss the various conditions of the requirements in advance, representatives were not sent to the company for contact until 5:30 p.m., so the negotiations may be postponed to today. The contents of the conditions proposed for improving treatment are still under discussion. The tram service between the two concessions has been connected. As the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession agreed with the French Electricity Company yesterday, it was too late to implement it. It is hoped that the tram service will resume today.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Workers at Coal Ball Factories Suddenly Go on Strike; Workers Did Not Propose Conditions in Advance; Reasons for Strike Will Be Clear in a Few Days <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Recent labor unrest has been occurring in the city. Yesterday, workers at various machine-made coal ball factories also went on strike. The following is a report from the United News Agency after investigating the situation:</p>
<p>Conditions Not Proposed Before the Strike</p>
<p>There are no less than one hundred and several dozen machine-made coal ball factories and small-scale coal ball companies in the city, with a total of about several thousand workers. Starting yesterday morning, these workers suddenly went on a joint strike. They did not propose any specific conditions for improving treatment in advance, resulting in the shutdown of work at factories such as Taixing, Nanyang, Dongfang, Guohua, Guotai, and Tongyuan. The striking workers immediately gathered in front of factories such as Yitaixing and blocked workers from going to work and shipping goods.</p>
<p>More Than Ten Striking Workers Arrested</p>
<p>The striking workers then went to various factories in the Public Concession and the French Concession to threaten workers who had not gone on strike to participate in the strike. The police in the two concessions, fearing that incidents would occur, quickly dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the factories to suppress the situation. The French Concession Police Department arrested more than ten troublemaking workers when they went to threaten workers at various factories and took them to the police station for questioning. However, there were still workers in front of various factories and companies blocking the transport of goods, not allowing them to be shipped.</p>
<p>Management Sends Letter Requesting Union to Stop the Strike</p>
<p>After the incident, the factory owners jointly sent a letter to the Coal Ball Industry Association, requesting it to ask the Shanghai Municipal Council to find a way to stop the strike. The original text is as follows: "Respectfully, between the work of starting to make balls in our factory this morning, dozens of unfamiliar crowds suddenly gathered in the factory and asked to stop work. The factory's neighbors were also in groups blocking the delivery trucks. Under the turmoil of our factory, we are deeply afraid that incidents will occur. We have to temporarily stop work to wait for a solution. After investigating, the salary received by the workers in each factory has always been very generous, and the labor-management relationship has always been very harmonious. Recently, as the cost of living has risen, the authorities of each factory have increased subsidies in advance, and the workers are satisfied. This incident is very unexpected. Not only have the authorities of each factory not heard of it in advance, but also the ball-making workers are horrified. We hereby send a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council to quickly discuss the handling of the matter and protect the start of work. We are deeply afraid that people from all walks of life will not investigate the situation and confuse the news, so we specially send this letter to your association to announce the true situation to correct the perception."</p>
<h3 id="e61">Abnormal Weather; Mold Season Arrives Early <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>According to astronomical measurements yesterday, not only has the mold season arrived early this year, but the tide is also particularly high, which has not been seen in decades. This humid atmosphere contains a quality that is most likely to destroy all items, and the color often turns black, making it impossible to clean. Liquid, solid, and gaseous substances cannot resist it. It is not advisable to hoard things. As for rice and other grains containing water, there will be other changes due to chemical reactions.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Matsuoka's Inquiry to Germany and Italy Unlikely to Succeed; Hoping for Germany's Assistance Based on Strength More Difficult Than Italy; Sea Power Controlled by Britain, German Ships Even Harder to Fly Over <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post commented that according to news from Berlin, Japanese observers there are now doubtful whether Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka's inquiry to Germany and Italy this time will be able to obtain promises of assistance from the two countries to cope with a possible incident in the Pacific. This report is the only humorous story that has made us laugh when we have been unable to find one for a long time. We certainly do not need to wait for their talks to end and deliver the final reply to Matsuoka, and we can reply on his behalf: Japan cannot obtain any assistance from Germany, but German ships moored in Japanese ports may have greater freedom of movement in and out of the high seas than they do now, but once they set sail, they will serve Germany and will never work for Japan, which can be asserted. Not only is this the case now, but Germany will never supply Japan with any aircraft, warships, or other military supplies in the future. What Germany will give Japan is only lip service such as "cooperation" and "advice." Apart from this, there can be no substantial assistance. Anyone who doubts this can look at the previous example of Italy. Before the Greek army won a great victory and the British army in North Africa won successive victories, Germany had not provided any assistance to Italy. Finally, although the German army intervened and sent mechanized aircraft and armies to Albania and Libya, the purpose of this move was not to help the Italian army win, but only to prevent Italy from being destroyed. If the Italian army fails again, Germany will eventually suffer and fail. If Japan attempts to obtain assistance from Germany, the possibility is even less than Germany's assistance to Italy. The reason is due to various difficulties. Even if Germany wants to provide assistance, it is difficult to do so. Because the sea power is controlled by Britain one day, Germany's aircraft, tanks, ships, warships, plunder ships, and troops will not be able to reach Japan one day. If the British Navy loses its ability to control the sea route between Europe and Asia, Japan does not need Germany's assistance. Japan believes that Germany will achieve victory, so it is taking risks at a time when there is no certainty and using the country's destiny as wealth. The risk is very great. If Matsuoka intends to make a new deal with such merchants, he should obtain a good and reliable guarantee in advance. If he can further sever business dealings with them to avoid the fate of bankruptcy in the future, it would be the best policy.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Cotton Cloth Shop Manager He Qinhua Kidnapped Yesterday; Walked to Market to Listen to Market Conditions; Met Robbers at the Staircase and Kidnapped Without Trace <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>At about 8:00 a.m. yesterday, a kidnapping case suddenly occurred in front of the cotton market at 115 Hankou Road, Public Concession. The kidnapped person was He Qinhua, a cotton cloth merchant. The three kidnappers kidnapped him, forced him into a car parked on the side of the road, and drove away without a trace. The following are the details of the incident:</p>
<p>Pulling Clothes to Climb Stairs</p>
<p>He Qinhua, 35 years old, is from Ningbo and is the manager of Ruichangxing Cotton Cloth Shop at 457 Lane 6, Ningbo Road. He usually lives in the shop and goes to the cotton cloth market every morning to listen to market conditions, which is his usual practice. At about 8:15 a.m. yesterday, He was wearing a gray and green wool long gown and walked from the shop to the cotton cloth market at 115 Hankou Road. Just as he was pulling his clothes to climb the stairs to the second floor,</p>
<p>Met Robbers at the Staircase</p>
<p>Suddenly, three kidnappers who had been lying in ambush at the staircase, one of whom was holding a pistol, threatened He and forbade him to make a sound. He was then taken downstairs and forced into a car parked in advance, which sped westward. At that time, people entering and leaving the cotton cloth market witnessed this scene and knew it was a kidnapping, so they quickly reported it to the police station.</p>
<p>Reasons for Kidnapping</p>
<p>It was learned that the reason for He's kidnapping may be related to the large-scale yarn fraud case. Previously, a person named Jin Zhonghou falsely set up a company in Ruichangxing, forged Yufeng Yarn Warehouse receipts, and sold them to colleagues to defraud a large sum of more than 800,000 yuan. After He discovered it, Jin fled and four employees, including Wang, were arrested. The court is about to open, and He needs to testify in court. Therefore, it is widely believed that He's kidnapping is related to this. The police station is currently investigating.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Returning to Hometown – Shanghai <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>After being away from my hometown of Shanghai for more than three years, I feel a little different when I first arrive.</p>
<p>I grew up in Shanghai, so Shanghai is of course my hometown. Although in the past, I had been to Xuzhou, Jinan, Tianjin, and even Taiyuan in Shanxi, I didn't live there for long. After a month or two, I returned to this bustling Shanghai. So every time I came back, I only had a character and landscape emotion left on my mind for the places I had stayed. I didn't feel any emotion for my hometown of Shanghai, just like seeing my parents and siblings when I returned home from school every Saturday!</p>
<p>There are many unexpected twists and turns on the road of life: I remember in the winter of 1937, I was satisfied to leave Shanghai and go to Suzhou, but the war forced me to flee to Zhenjiang on foot. From Zhenjiang, I fled to Xiannvmiao in Jiangbei, found a friend, and then fled to the waterways running between Chongqing and Wuhan, lived in Hankou, and went to Jiujiang and Pengze. Later, I stayed in Yichang, Badong, Wanxian, and Chongqing for several months. Finally, I went to the Chongqing-Yunnan Highway, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the Vietnam National Road to reach Saigon. I lived there for two years, and I didn't return to this isolated island of Shanghai until January 28th of this year.</p>
<p>On the eve of leaving Shanghai, I posted the bombing of the Great World and Sincere Company. In Chenjiadu, West Shanghai, I had stepped over the bodies of compatriots who had been injured by the bombing and fled into the concession. After leaving Shanghai, I often lived in air raid alarms, so after leaving Kunming, when I first arrived in Hanoi and saw the tall new buildings, the brightly lit cafes, the boating on Sword Lake, and the beautiful and soft expectations, my nervous nerves relaxed. In this warm Hanoi, I exchanged the national currency that I had worked so hard to save in the country for the Vietnamese currency at a rate of four yuan to one yuan, and I spent a lot of it in this comfortable environment. Not long after arriving in Saigon, the European war broke out, and this peaceful Southeast Asia seemed to be possessed and began to become tense. Many people on the street changed into military uniforms, but the entertainment venues were still the same. When Germany and France stopped fighting, although Vietnam didn't even smell gunpowder, it had to wear "national mourning." Except for movie theaters, other entertainment venues could only close down. After that, a dispute broke out on the Sino-Vietnamese border, and Saigon often had blackouts. From then on, the peaceful Vietnam wore "mourning clothes," with a crying face, which made people sad to see!</p>
<p>The Dada South Wheel brought us back to our hometown of Shanghai: When the ship entered the Wusongkou, Miss Lang said that her heart was beating violently, and I myself felt a kind of indescribable uneasiness; Shanghai, my hometown that I had been away from for more than three years, I didn't know what the scenery would be like? After getting off the boat at the Gonghexiang pier, a truck took us to Gaun Road. We first passed through the calm Hongkou and entered the concession to see the dirty alleys and the dilapidated houses crowded with people. I exclaimed, "This kind of 'living' is really not for 'people' to live in." Indeed, I had never seen the living conditions of Shanghai's petty bourgeoisie anywhere else!</p>
<p>Before arriving in Shanghai, friends often wrote letters saying how much more prosperous Shanghai had become. The names of Jinmen, Dihua, and entertainment venues were all places I had heard of for a long time, but had never seen. A few foreigners on the same ship who were "old Shanghai hands" also boasted about Shanghai's prosperity. Only one Frenchman who was an "old Beiping hand" said that Shanghai, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places were all suffering unprecedented disasters.</p>
<p>Before disembarking, my classmate Yan said to me that after working hard for several years, when we arrived in Shanghai, we would first stay at the tallest international hotel in the Far East, and then go to see and play in those places that we had "heard of but never seen." I, who was squeezed out of the smoke and fire, also felt that this was the first thing I should do after returning to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, after disembarking, everyone dispersed. I first met some old friends and relatives, and then heard some Shanghai news. The original idea was blown away by some wind.</p>
<p>In the past two months, I have met old friends who used to be wealthy but are now down and out, and I have also eaten in the new homes of friends who have become wealthy. After three and a half years of separation, everything has "changed" like "magic." There are people everywhere on the streets, in dance halls, on cars, in restaurants, in theaters, in hotels, in tea houses, everywhere is "full." Rice prices are soaring, life is impossible to maintain, and strikes are words that can be heard every day on this "isolated island." Shanghai was originally an incomprehensible deformed city, and Shanghai after becoming an "isolated island" is even more of a mysterious city that cannot be understood!</p>

<h3 id="e67">Revolution in the Medical Field <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Weidan, a newly arrived medical doctor and inventor of the latest medical techniques, has techniques so novel that they astonish the people of this city. Dr. Weidan does not require the help of medicine; he simply touches the nose with two small metal rods to cure various diseases. According to the theory invented by Dr. Weidan, he firmly believes that various diseases are caused by the dysfunction of the human nerve, called the sympathetic main nerve. This nerve is indeed the master of our health. The main nerve is divided into countless small nerves, which are spread throughout the body and end in the nasal mucosa. After fifteen years of research, Dr. Weidan has a thorough understanding of the control of these large and small nerves. He knows that touching a certain point on the nerve can cause a certain organ in the body to react and thus be able to treat the disease of that organ.</p>
<p>Countless incurable diseases have been treated with Dr. Weidan's new method, all of which are effective. For example, a patient with asthma can have the disease disappear after only a few treatments, with breathing becoming harmonious and asthma relieved. Furthermore, people with nervous sensitivity are most prone to panic and palpitations, or feel that the nerves have lost control, often becoming angry for no reason, or feeling depressed. Once Dr. Weidan applies his new therapy, the heart and mind become calm, and one feels happy and confident.</p>
<p>Insomnia at night can be treated to achieve sound sleep, and rheumatic bone pain can be stopped immediately. Moreover, Dr. Weidan's new medical technique can also regulate the circulation of blood vessels, so women often suffer from menstrual diseases, such as dysmenorrhea and amenorrhea. Those who have been treated by the doctor have their dysmenorrhea disappear and their menstruation become normal.</p>
<p>As for the symptoms of premature aging, one often feels weak and tired. After being treated with Dr. Weidan's new method, one's complexion glows, and one's energy is vigorous, as if one is a different person. Now, as the doctor travels around the world to promote his technique, he is making a short stay in Shanghai. After a couple of months, he will move on. Anyone suffering from the above-mentioned diseases who wants to see his new medical treatment should not miss this opportunity and come for treatment as soon as possible.</p>
<p>It is reported that Dr. Weidan is currently staying in room 707 of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, with outpatient hours from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. daily. All patients must have their symptoms and reactions examined by the doctor before treatment, which is not comparable to those who act rashly.</p>

<p>Chenghe Pawnshop Robbed of Sixty to Seventy Thousand Yuan; Two Employees Killed, One Injured</p>
<p>The Chenghe Pawnshop, located at 386, the intersection of Pupu Road (Datiebang) and Bai'er Road, was solely owned by Wu Huaiqing from Nanhui. He served as manager, but recently returned to his hometown due to illness. The shop only had employees Huang Shizhang (30 years old), Fu Mengyuan (25 years old), and Zhang Xingsheng (31 years old), all from Nanhui. They handled daily shop affairs. At 10 PM on the 26th, just as the shop was about to close, four robbers speaking dialects from Jiangbei and other places suddenly appeared. One stood guard at the door, closing it. The other three entered, brandishing pistols, threatening and forbidding any outcry. They forced the three employees Huang, Fu, and Zhang into a small room behind the shop hall, locking the door behind them. The three robbers then went upstairs to the vault to loot. Huang and the others shouted loudly for help, angering the robbers. They opened the door to the small room and used hemp and straw ropes to tie up Huang, Fu, and Zhang, stuffing their mouths with cotton. The four robbers then proceeded to search the premises thoroughly, which took an hour. As they were descending the stairs with their loot, the robbers re-entered the small room and fired several shots at Huang, Fu, and Zhang. Huang and Fu were hit in the head, a fatal area, and died instantly. Zhang Xingsheng was also wounded in the head, but fortunately not in a vital area, and managed to survive. After the shooting, the robbers left with their loot, making their escape and closing the door behind them. Consequently, no one noticed anything overnight. It wasn't until 8 AM yesterday morning, when someone knocked on the door to redeem a pawn, that the door was found ajar. Pushing it open, they heard groans and discovered the robbery and murder that had taken place the night before. They reported it to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to investigate. They first took the seriously injured Zhang Xingsheng to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Then, they sent the bodies of Huang and Fu to the coroner's office for examination. It is reported that in addition to over 800 yuan in cash, the shop lost gold jewelry and other valuables estimated at sixty to seventy thousand yuan. Relatives of the shop owner have dispatched someone to the countryside to urge him to come to Shanghai, to assess the losses and handle the aftermath. Meanwhile, the police have issued an order to apprehend the fleeing robbers and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>A Tragedy Under Rising Living Costs: Mother Drowns Daughter</p>
<p>A woman from Changshu named Pan Chen (42 years old) had a daughter named Miaogen. Recently, due to dire circumstances, Pan Chen, through a friend's introduction, became a servant at the Chen household at No. 28, Lane 288, Yaozhujiao Road, in the French Concession. However, because Miaogen had nowhere to live and no way to earn a living, Pan Chen had a bizarre idea. A few days ago, she lured her daughter to the Hongqiao Road riverside and, taking advantage of her daughter's unpreparedness, pushed her into the water, intending to drown her. Fortunately, a passerby from the village rescued the girl and sent her to the Zhonghua Ciyou Association for treatment and care. Pan Chen found out about this and yesterday went to the association, insisting on taking her daughter back. The association reported this to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to arrest Pan Chen and await interrogation.</p>

<p>Four Women Arrested; Large Quantity of Narcotics Confiscated</p>
<p>The narcotics division of the Public Concession Police, led by Chinese detectives Liu Zhaonian and Wang Shusen, and officers Zhao Baosheng and Guo Shouxin, cracked a major drug den at 10:30 PM the day before yesterday, in rooms 3 and 6 of the Lin'an Hotel, No. 9, Lane 506, Guangdong Road. They arrested four women from Yangzhou: Li Nie, Wu Manqing, Xu Aizhen, and Xu Xu. They confiscated twenty-five and a half taels of heroin worth over eight thousand yuan, and fifty taels of opium worth approximately two thousand yuan. It was discovered that the main culprit in this case, Xu Changgao (i.e., Xu Xu's husband), was not present at the time and therefore was not apprehended. He is currently being vigorously pursued. The arrested suspects were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan charged them according to the regulations for the prohibition of narcotics and opium. After questioning by Judge Feng, a new hearing was scheduled for one week later. The heroin and opium were temporarily stored in the warehouse.</p>

<p>All drivers of the four moving companies in Shanghai, Taiping, Ningbo, Yong'an, and Shangtian, jointly requested a wage increase from their employers the day before yesterday, due to the increasing cost of living in Shanghai and the difficulty in making ends meet. Taiping, Ningbo, and Yong'an demanded a 100% increase, while Shangtian demanded 150% (because the company's drivers only earned 24 yuan per month). Because the employers did not accept, negotiations could not proceed. It is now reported that both labor and management feel that a prolonged stalemate is not beneficial to society or to their own interests. They have scheduled a renewed negotiation for 10 AM on the 31st to discuss a solution.</p>

<h3 id="e75">Food: Despite Abundant Arrivals of Foreign Rice, Speculators' Ambitions Remain Undeterred; They Create Problems Whenever Rice Prices Are Slightly Low <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice has been arriving in abundance for days, causing market prices to plummet repeatedly. Yesterday, in addition to 23,000 bags newly arrived awaiting unloading, previous shipments had not yet been completely unloaded from the warehouses. Furthermore, subsequent shipments continued to arrive steadily. The market had no need for a turnaround. However, after the market opened yesterday, local retailers within this street took advantage of the low prices to purchase, and prices showed a slight rebound. Subsequently, due to rumors of a 4-yuan increase in Hong Kong shipping costs, those holding goods hoarded them, driving up prices. Customer stockpiling suddenly surged, and the market gradually rose. Small-grained rice was particularly resilient, with strong demand from inland areas, rebounding 3 to 5 yuan compared to the previous market. Other types of rice rose by 2 to 4 yuan. Small-grained rice was priced at 3,600 to 3,700 yuan per hundred, medium-grade rice at 3,200 to 3,300 yuan, No. 1 Saigon rice at 3,100 to 3,200 yuan, and down to 2,800 yuan. No. 2 Saigon rice was priced at 3,200 to 3,000 yuan, and broken rice at 2,500 to 2,600 yuan, and down to 2,300 yuan, an increase of 200 to 300 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Suzhou steamer arrived at the port the day before yesterday (the 26th) in the evening, unloading 19,215 bags from Hong Kong at the company's dock in the French Concession. The Ganzhou steamer arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, also carrying 9,265 bags from Hong Kong, along with 301 bags and 864 bags of corn to be transshipped to Yantai. The Java Company's Zhiba-De postal ship arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, also carrying over 2,100 bags from Hong Kong, unloading at the Pudong Blue Funnel dock. (Zu)</p>
<p>Although arrivals of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice were still not strong yesterday, sales were also not strong. Therefore, supply and demand were similar, and the market showed no significant fluctuations. Opening prices were similar to before. Special grade japonica rice was priced at 123 to 124 yuan per dan, and ordinary grade at 120 yuan. Kunshan rice was priced at 118 yuan for white japonica rice, and down to 111 to 112 yuan. Thin japonica rice from Qingjiao was priced at 112 yuan to 111.5 yuan per dan. Original packages remained unopened.</p>
<p>There was only sporadic demand for glutinous rice, but sellers' sentiments were slightly firm, and they tried hard to maintain prices. Therefore, the resulting selling prices tended to stabilize, without significant changes. Hong Kong glutinous rice opened at 100 yuan and remained at 105 yuan, and down to 101 yuan. Glutinous green beans were priced at 94 to 95 yuan, and down to 87 to 88 yuan for broken beans.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Flour Market Stable Again <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The flour market has turned slightly stable. After sales to domestic customers were light for several consecutive days and speculators sought to sell and profit, foreign flour prices have fallen considerably. Australian flour prices are now on par with Canadian flour prices. This is the result of speculators blindly following trends. However, when the market opened yesterday, domestic customers took advantage of the low prices, prompted by the scarcity and low prices of Australian flour and rising rice prices. Huaniao Zhonglou brand Australian flour rebounded to 29.40 to 29.60 yuan, while Jinlong brand Canadian flour only opened at 28.80 to 28.90 yuan. This is because future shipments of Canadian flour will be abundant, while Australian flour inventories are low and the quality is higher. Other American flour brands, such as Hongri Dangtian brand, and Sailing and Yellow Cow brands, also had low inventories and complete packaging. Sellers mostly held on, waiting for an opportunity to move. Therefore, the market gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>The wheat market remained stagnant. Domestic prices have been driven up by the situation in Shanghai, and arrivals are extremely rare. Market supply is dwindling, making it a market with no goods. High-grade Du wheat is reportedly priced at 50 yuan. Japanese factories are still purchasing at 45 to 46 yuan, with daily retail sales of only a few hundred bags.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Oil Market: Soybean Oil Surges Due to Relentless Speculation <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the oil market has been assisted by a harsh environment with outside speculators, and a major search for stockpiles has led to many covering shorts, causing the market to surge. Yesterday morning, rumors that Japanese military notes had soared to 2.50 yuan pushed the oil market to its peak, surpassing the previous day's prices by 3 yuan. However, in the afternoon, the air cleared, Japanese notes fell, and the underlying trend was unfavorable for long positions. Overbought speculators rushed to sell, driving the market downward. The daily price swing was about 2 yuan. As a result, it was still supported by the cotton yarn merchants, so the closing price was still about 2 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Peanut oil initially followed the rise by 3 yuan, but no transactions were made in the afternoon. A total of 30 cases of Jiaozhou raw oil, 50 cases of Yantai raw oil, 300 tins of Yantai raw oil, 1,000 tins of Jiangbei Benfang raw oil, 20 cases of soybean oil, 150 loads of Dayou factory oil, 170 barrels of Hankou barrel oil, and 200 barrels of Dalian oil were traded. Contracts for 2,000 barrels to be delivered in April and over 1,000 barrels to be delivered in late April were made.</p>
<p>In addition, 500 tins of raw oil arrived yesterday from Qingdao, and 1,007 bags of soybeans arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<p>Today (the 28th), 1,490 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Hong Kong, 1,850 bags to Singapore, and 440 bags of soybeans along with 600 soybean cakes and 100 tins of raw oil to Little Luzon.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Finance: Speculative Activity Weakens; Foreign Exchange Eases <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market was steady, with HSBC listed rates unchanged. The private market for British and American exchange showed a loosening trend, but after the US President signed the 700 billion yuan military aid bill, speculators were less active. External investors sold out, causing the rate to harden slightly. Subsequently, the Japanese bank absorbed some of the selling, causing the rate to return to steady. However, as the Chinese bank in Shanghai dumped its positions, the market loosened again. It was rumored that the Chinese bank in Shanghai had sold 400,000 USD. In the afternoon, rumors spread, and the market continued to harden. The weakest American rate was 5.3125 yuan. The English rate was .31234375. By closing the English rate was .3121875, and the American rate was 5.28125, higher than the previous day. The 4-month future rate remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Many Chinese Merchants Sell</p>
<p>At the start of the day, London drafts were steady, and American silver and London gold prices were unchanged. Exchange rates between England and the US and between the US and England were also unchanged. Central bank rates for all exchanges remained as before. At the start of the day, the bank rate for cash was .31203125 yuan for the English exchange and 5.25 yuan for the American exchange, unchanged from the previous day. Speculators tried to sell March American exchange at 5.28125, and the market loosened. At that time, current exchange was offered at .3121875. The HSBC listed rate and the silver parity rate remained unchanged. Later, the Japanese bank bought in American exchange at 5.28125, making it briefly difficult to settle. Then, the market steadied.

<p>The gold market red-hot private market fell again yesterday, back into the 6,600 yuan range.

<p>The government bond private market was still spinning, but selling pressure was slightly firm. This was due to the pullback, and it remains to be seen whether it will strengthen. Over-the-counter transactions were limited, with Xinfu's demand generally satisfied and Tongkang selling, but investors are still active. This morning, Xinfu and Xinhua showed strong buying interest and Yitai and Jufeng also bought in.

<p>The cotton yarn market is dull and lacks features, as actual sales are increasingly sluggish. Today, Hong Kong buyers only purchased less than 100 bales, so confidence is weak. At the same time, foreign exchange is quiet and the parity rate is firm. As a result, speculators are unable to be active. However, long positions are still stable and are not being liquidated, so the market is slow. In general, the fundamental problem depends on the amount of actual demand. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,400 yuan and the low price was 1,390 yuan. Also, 80 cotton bales have been shipped to Little Luzon and 80 to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened dull, with a price of 1,400 yuan, with high selling. It quickly fell to 1,390 yuan. Afterwards, the market steadied, but customer sales remained weak, and new buyers lacked enthusiasm. The market softened again, back to 1,393-1394 yuan. It circled for a long time at that price, until the closing price of 1,392 yuan. The total amount traded in the last half-day was 6,545 bags. The total amounts bought by each category are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 95, Community: 6,450 Total: 6,545</p>

<p>The current cotton situation: factory demand is generally low, but yarn sales are not strong, so there is little demand for raw material. The peer trading has increased since future source is considered affected. A total of 999 bales of foreign cotton were traded yesterday, and prices continued to rise by 1 to 2 yuan. Transactions were made on the left side, at the following prices: American Pengjiapo: 284.0, Peer 299 bales</p>

<p>Indian cotton was also stable, the market remained firm, and yesterday, including the forecast, prices rose about three rupees.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trade was supported by small-scale buyers, with the rise and fall of 1 to 2 yuan. Factories did not dare to purchase in large quantities, so interest has been reduced a lot. There have been high peer trading, so it is not enough to say that the cotton market is booming and the future is optimistic.</p>
<p>More Indian cotton has arrived in Shanghai, Taikoo company's Suzhou steamer, carrying 457 bales of Indian cotton from Hong Kong, arrived at the port and stopped, the company's dock for unloading, (Zu)</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was stable, but customer sales were sluggish due to traffic congestion.

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a rise in Dutch sugar prices due to increased production costs for coarse white sugar. May shipments were priced at US$3.575, based on C.I.F. terms. Consequently, the guild adjusted its quotations, tightening the market.

<p>Despite the recent high-profile announcement by the China Coal Company regarding deadlines for clearing warehouse receipts, the coal market remains unconcerned. Traders continue to operate in their own way, pushing prices higher with insatiable greed. Yesterday, Indian bituminous coal transactions reached 350 yuan, but only for old warehouse receipts; no new receipts have been issued. As a result, even second-grade coal is being driven up in price.</p>

<p>From a historical perspective: Magellan, leading the Spanish, reached the Philippine Islands in 1521. He named them the Philippines in honor of Prince Philip of Spain. Later, in 1565, the Spanish completely colonized the islands. The introduction of sweet potatoes to China occurred during the Wanli reign (1573-1619). According to the records of the Fujian Provincial Gazetteer, it happened in 1595. Although rumors may vary, the evidence, whether direct or indirect, points to sweet potatoes originating from Luzon, which is irrefutable!</p>
<p>As for the records in the Dianbai County Gazetteer of Guangdong: "In Xiadong Township, there is a Sweet Potato Forest Lord Temple... Legend has it that sweet potatoes came from Jiaozhi... Planting them in China was punishable by death! Lin Huailan, a native of Wuchuan, was skilled in medicine. He traveled to Jiaozhou, where he effectively treated a general. He was then recommended to treat the king's daughter, whose illness he also cured. One day, he was given cooked sweet potatoes. Lin asked for raw ones, took half a piece, and quickly returned to China. At the border crossing, the border guard questioned him. Lin told him the truth and begged for private passage. The border guard said, 'Today's matter is that I eat the king's food, so letting you pass would be disloyal. However, I am grateful for your kindness, so betraying you would be unjust!' He then jumped into the water and died. Lin returned and planted the sweet potato in Guangdong, and now the temple is dedicated to him..." It doesn't mention when Lin lived. The border guard's suicide for privately allowing half a sweet potato to pass is also quite mythical. Even if this is absolutely true, it is difficult to overturn the previous conclusion that sweet potatoes came from Luzon. At most, it can be seen as separate paths leading to the same destination!

<h3 id="e90">Shanghai Education Officials Issue Statement Yesterday Regarding the Allocation of Relief Funds <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>(Ren Hua News Agency) Regarding the allocation of 800,000 yuan in relief funds for educators in Shanghai, although reports have been published in newspapers for the past three days, the true situation is still unclear to the outside world. A Dahua News Agency reporter specifically inquired with education officials, who issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Regarding the allocation of relief funds for Shanghai educators, the relevant departments received an order from the Ministry of Education to investigate the number of primary and secondary school educators in Shanghai. Forms were filled out and statistics compiled and submitted. The original telegram listed both primary and secondary schools together, indicating that the Ministry of Education did not want primary school colleagues to be excluded. This is consistent with the recent declarations and telegrams issued by various educational organizations. The news published in the Education Communication Weekly has not yet been fully verified, and no one dares to make a hasty judgment. In addition, transportation between Shanghai and Chongqing is obstructed, and the situation is very unclear. Colleagues in the education sector should not panic because of this news. Furthermore, it is not known whether these relief funds have been allocated to the Ministry of Education. Regarding the allocation issue, the Ministry of Education will definitely have a fair method, including seeking an additional 600,000 yuan in relief funds for primary schools. The Ministry will also faithfully report the situation and strongly urge approval. At present, the situation is difficult, and we should prioritize the overall situation. On the one hand, we should understand the central government's hard work in actively resisting and building the nation, and on the other hand, we should encourage ourselves to endure temporary hardships and work together to complete the great cause of resistance and reconstruction. We should all be vigilant against any propaganda that provokes discord or stirs up trouble, so as not to be taken advantage of.</p>

More than a dozen teams have signed up to participate, and the skill level of each team has improved significantly.

Before the competition, many strong players from the Youbang team, who are famous in Shanghai, participated in an exhibition. Mixed A team played against the United team, first to kick off the tournament. Mixed A team won four consecutive games, and although the United team was on the decline, they were not discouraged.

<p>The Paramount basketball expeditionary force, which left Shanghai on the 19th of this month, arrived in Hong Kong on the 23rd. Last night, the news of their first victory arrived, stating that they had a friendly match with the Hong Kong team on the night of their arrival. As a result, the Paramount expeditionary force won by 16 points, but the score was not detailed. It is known that due to the smaller venue, they were unable to exert their full strength. It is also known that the Paramount team, along with the Oriental team, left Hong Kong on the 25th for the Philippines. They are expected to arrive in Manila today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Li Yichen Did Not Accompany the Oriental Expedition, Developing Elsewhere in Shanghai <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Lazy Ox Li Yichen was previously hired by the Hong Kong Oriental Sports Association and planned to travel to the Philippines with the Oriental football team. The news was published in various newspapers. Li originally traveled with the Paramount basketball team from Shanghai. When Paramount left Shanghai, Li also went to the dock to see them off, leading to the misconception that Li had already departed for Hong Kong. It is now known that Li did not travel with Paramount that day and remained in Shanghai, developing elsewhere. He left Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Rumors <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Hui</p>
<p>Rumors are particularly strong today. It is commonplace for a rumor to cost dozens of lives, or for a rumor to generate hundreds of thousands in windfall profits.</p>
<p>The birth of a rumor is not without cause. The cause is always vigorously exaggerated by the rumor-monger. However, for a rumor to become "fact," it is not merely the rumormonger's exaggeration, but also the "rumor-hearer" or "rumor-helper" who hopes that the rumor will become fact!</p>
<p>How can this be explained? It's as clear as fire:</p>
<p>"Calm seas" are not conducive to making money. Create a rumor to stir up change. You deliberately treat the rumor as "fact," and he deliberately treats the rumor as "fact." That way, gold will skyrocket, and rice will become expensive. Once prices rise, endless amounts of money will pour in.</p>
<p>But a rumor is, after all, a rumor. Although the rumormonger treats it as "fact," he actually knows in his heart that it is a rumor...</p>
<p>Therefore, the rumor and the rumormonger will inevitably have their day of "death."</p>
<h3 id="e103">"Non-Hunger Pill" <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Zixu</p>
<p>"How wonderful it would be if one could be free from hunger!" "Alas! Rice prices have risen to over one hundred yuan per stone. How can we afford to eat?"</p>
<p>Fortunately, humans are "omnipotent." Is there anything that cannot be solved? The "divine formula" for "no hunger" has actually been "invented"! Oh, I misspoke. I'm very sorry. It turns out that it was "researched" from ancient books. Didn't the advertisement for "One-Day Non-Hunger Pill" appear in the newspaper on the 20th of this month?</p>
<p>It is said to be a "prescription" left by the immortal Hua Tuo, and it is specially intended to "relieve famine and save the world" in view of the current "skyrocketing prices and the hardship of life." So, I called to ask about it. It is said that the "price has not been set," but it will be "released" in one or two weeks. Ah! It will be released in just one or two weeks. Then won't the problem of the isolated army on the island be "easily solved" by then?</p>
<p>Setting aside other considerations, let's just talk about the demand for wage increases. If, at that time, you make a demand based on the reason that "we also need to eat," the answer you receive will no longer be the old tune of "contentment brings happiness," but a brand-new "theory" that sounds plausible: "Why do you still want an increase now? Isn't the One-Day Non-Hunger Pill much cheaper than rice? I have already planned for you. If you are willing to take this 'divine pill' regularly, you can still save some money and accumulate some savings. Moreover, after taking it, you can practice fasting and prolong life, making your 'hunger' bones even stronger." (The word "hunger" is copied directly from the advertisement.) Hearing this tone, even those who have rice to eat seem to "envy" those who eat the "Non-Hunger Pill." At that time, all wage earners must be "calm," but I fear that there will be a great hope of "wage cuts."</p>
<p>As for those foreign bosses, they will have even more to say. Because there are already nutritional, innate, and... differences between "meat-eaters" and "grain-eaters," and now that the Chinese also have "Immortal Non-Hunger Pills," their existence has one more kind of "immortal" "guarantee." The "sufficiency" of the reasons for refusing requests will surely fill a single volume as thick as an "encyclopedia."</p>
<p>Some people who saw the "Non-Hunger Pill" advertisement were inexplicably angry: "It's utter bullshit! Even our empty stomachs have become their target for speculation. What 'One-Day Non-Hunger Pill'? I've never heard of it in all my years. I'm afraid that once they get the legal tender, even if your stomach swells up like a stone, they won't bother with you." But the people who placed the advertisement had already thought of this "chess piece," so they stated in advance that this pill really has the "magical effect of fasting, prolonging life, and strengthening hunger bones," and it has already been "widely distributed to relatives and friends, and all have verified its effectiveness." Isn't their factory name "Wan'an" also constantly shouting "Rest assured! Rest assured!"? In reality, even if something goes wrong with the "magical effect" and someone kicks the bucket as a result, you can't say that this "divine pill" is not effective, unless you believe that someone who kicked the bucket would still shout: "I'm hungry! Please do a good deed!"</p>
<p>"As for those 'benevolent people' who know the 'divine immortal prescription,' why do they still need money?" Someone might ask. Then the person who placed this advertisement would shout loudly: "Don't we need to eat?" It turns out that they themselves do not swallow the "divine pill" to survive.</p>
<h3 id="e104">"Miraculous Hands Restore Spring" <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Sima Jun</p>
<p>"Miraculous hands restore spring" is a compliment to a skilled surgeon, but this compliment seems a bit too much!</p>
<p>Figurative language should be used appropriately - but those who use figurative language are often like this.</p>
<p>Yesterday I passed by western Shanghai, at the end of a slum, and saw a bamboo cloth sign that said "Miraculous hands restore spring." Looking closely, it turned out to be a street vendor's medical stall. Seeing his appearance, it seemed that he also had a foundation: "Medicine bottles" covered with dust, injection "needles," and pus-sucking "bamboo tubes" were neatly arranged on the board. The old quack looked dignified, with the air of a "hero of his time."</p>
<p>I watched his medical skills. He burned a piece of yellow paper inside the "bamboo tube," and as the air was forced outward, he stuck it on the patient's lower abdomen. Then he inserted the "needle" into the leg, and the lower abdomen was sucked out a piece of red flesh, and blood was flowing from the leg. He said decisively to the person: "The poison must be cleared. Come again tomorrow!"</p>
<p>But when I saw his medical skills, my soul was not at home!</p>
<p>However, this is what is called: one era, two methods. The outdated old-style medical skills must have this last fierce struggle.</p>
<p>In fact, this struggle further reveals its inevitability of decline, and "miraculous hands restore spring" will forever be used as a figurative expression.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Autumn Begonia <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouhe</p>
<p>(5) Differentiation of Love and the Sinner</p>
<p>In reality, neither of them saw anything. Their hearts were spinning like a pair of flywheels on a train, each wanting to pour out their innermost feelings to the other, yet feeling they had only met twice, and it shouldn't be this quick to understand each other. Moreover, they didn't know where to begin.</p>
<p>Liangmi Street was originally a very remote place in the city. The Luo family lived in a solitary courtyard, and if the people inside the house were silent, no sound could be heard from the outside, leaving only gusts of not-so-vigorous autumn wind blowing through the treetops outside the window.</p>
<p>"Sitting here is meaningless. How about I show you something?" Xiangqi suddenly stood up, breaking the silence.</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia, of course, didn't have time to say yes, but before Xiangqi brought out what she was talking about, he really couldn't guess what interesting thing it could be.</p>
<p>In fact, what Xiangqi took out was not a plaything, but a small photo album; however, this was indeed what Autumn Begonia most liked to see. At the same time, Xiangqi also knew that he would definitely like to see it, because the dozens of photos pasted on it were all different images of her from childhood to adulthood, over the past twenty years.</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia carefully took it over, flipping through it page by page like appreciating antiques. Each photo took him at least three to four minutes to scrutinize, and he kept asking about the location and time each photo was taken. He felt that this was truly the greatest loss in his life, because among so many photos of Xiangqi, not a single one was taken with him.</p>
<p>"Who is this?" On the sixth page, he found a photo of a boy and a girl, both around ten years old. The girl was, of course, Xiangqi, but he didn't know who the boy was, so he asked with obvious jealousy.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Not the Fate of the Wealthy, Yet Afflicted with Ailments of the Wealthy! <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Su Dake</p>
<p>The squeeze of life forces one to toil day and night, and the meager income is not even enough for basic needs, let alone paying attention to the body's nutrition. Unregulated hard work eventually caused the already weak body to decline further; moreover, a dangerous sign appeared: coughing! After a particularly violent cough, what came out was not phlegm, but bright red blood.</p>
<p>I was stunned. I didn't believe that my struggle in life would have such an unfortunate encounter. However, this unfortunate reality had ruthlessly descended. It doesn't care that you are the one responsible for supporting a family!</p>
<p>My mother's anxiety, the concern of friends, led to the idea of going to a doctor to get an X-ray.</p>
<p>"There's something wrong with both tips of your lungs!"</p>
<p>"Hmm..." The doctor held the X-ray film and pointed with a heavy expression. I felt a sinking feeling, as if a death sentence had been pronounced in court.</p>
<p>"Your illness requires a long period of rest. It's best to stay in a sanatorium, wouldn't you say?"</p>
<p>"...My finances are tight, I'm afraid I can't..."</p>
<p>"Then... resting at home, the first thing is long-term quiet. You must lie all day in a room with good air circulation and sunlight. Absolutely no labor... You must have a nourishing and rich diet, eat more meat, fresh vegetables, fresh milk, and eggs... Your mental state must be stable, optimistic, and forget everything..."</p>
<p>I appreciated the doctor's sincere advice.</p>
<p>Lying in the dark, cramped room, smelling the oily fumes from the neighbor's coal stove seeping in through the cracks in the door, triggered another coughing fit. Thinking about the doctor's advice, I couldn't help but feel lost. Not to mention the meat that only the rich could afford at more than two yuan a catty, the milk at more than one yuan a pound, and the eggs at more than two mao each. The sun and air are supposed to be for everyone, right? But if you don't have money, you can forget about it. Work has stopped, and the family's livelihood is also uncertain. How can one be at peace of mind, how can one forget everything!</p>
<p>My poor old mother sighed deeply, looking at the small wooden box under the bed that held rice, which was now empty!</p>
<p>Not the fate of the wealthy, yet afflicted with ailments of the wealthy, alas!</p>

<h3 id="e107">"Swing Time" <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Fanfang</p>
<p>Ever since Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers broke up, I've been worried about him. Because it's really not easy to find a dance partner similar to Ginger Rogers; the fact is, this gentleman has no acting chops on his face. If he doesn't have a good partner, his performance will definitely be greatly diminished. Now, in this film "Swing Time," Paulette Goddard fills Ginger's absence. Although Paulette's acting skills and dance moves can't be compared to Ginger Rogers, she is still an ideal partner for Fred Astaire. This is probably why "Swing Time" is still worth watching.</p>
<p>"Swing Time" is less of a musical and more of a pure comedy. Because the story is comedic, and the form of the performance is even more comedic. It tells the story of two trumpet players in a university band, Fred Astaire and Meredith, pursuing a female secretary in an unknown band, Paulette Goddard. The development of the entire story is built on "pursuit," such as the on-the-spot brilliance during the band's performance, and the rich man and Meredith drinking together, secretly putting sleeping pills in each other's drinks, resulting in everyone falling asleep all night. The most wonderful part is when the rich man goes to Paulette's apartment, and Fred Astaire and Meredith separately "tail" him. Everyone meets under the bed, and as a result, Meredith disguises himself as Paulette's husband, scaring the rich man away. These are what are considered Hollywood comedies.</p>
<p>The dance scenes, which are the main selling point to attract the audience, are only two. One is the "Butterfly Dance" performed by Fred and Paulette, with novel and unique steps. Fred is, of course, as graceful and romantic as ever, while Paulette is also light and fluid. The other is the climax at the end of the play, where Fred conducts the band with a baton, accompanied by beautiful music and soft lighting, which can be said to be the most exciting part of the film.</p>
<p>In short, Hollywood comedies cannot be judged by common sense. Fortunately, the director is still able to use his skillful hands to control the audience's emotions.</p>

<p>Chapter 4: Swallows Kicking Flowers, Falling on the Dance Mat</p>
<p>The woman performed many styles on horseback. The gongs and drums gradually slowed down, and the horse arrived in the center of the field. The woman jumped down. The large man came over, held the horse, and handed a pair of pear blossom double knives to the woman. The woman took them in her hand and began to wield them swiftly. At first, one could still see a figure, but later, each strike was tighter than the last, turning into a ball of white light, rolling east and rolling west. Li Xin watched, almost shouting "Bravo!" Suddenly, the woman rolled on the ground, rolling in front of Li Xin and Xu Jing, and stood up abruptly, the shiny double knives flashing in front of their faces. The people around were so scared that they dodged away, but Li Xin and Xu Jing remained unmoved, standing there upright. The woman quickly retracted the knives and jumped back. After completing the entire set of knife techniques, the sounds also stopped. The woman threw the double knives to a partner, stood in the center of the field with her hands on her hips, face not red, breath not panting, only using a pair of fluid eyes to look at Li Xin and Xu Jing. The large man held a large plate and said to the crowd, "Ladies and gentlemen, our girl has put in a lot of effort. Thank you for your praise. Now, please reward her with some money. I know that the people of Qixian place here have always been very generous." After the large man finished speaking, Li Xin heard this and finally felt that he was wrong. Why didn't he speak earlier to drive them away, and instead, he also watched? He then stepped forward and said, "Where did you come from to perform here? Don't you know that the front of Li Family Manor has never allowed people from the jianghu to perform here? If you want to borrow some travel expenses from me, Li Xin, that can be discussed. Why did you insist on performing here and injure my family, what is the reason? Now you want to ask for money? There's no such easy thing." After hearing Li Xin's words, the large man looked Li Xin up and down, then said with a smile, "So you are Master Li, much respect. We came here earlier to temporarily perform once outside the manor. Unexpectedly, the guards from Master Li's manor were disrespectful to us and used force to drive us away. Our girl accidentally injured the guards when defending herself. Although this was our girl's mistake, the guards at your place are also to blame. Master Li, don't be offended, I'll ask the girl to come and apologize to Master Li, how about it?" (23)</p>

<p>— Duan Yuan</p>
<p>The ability of Peking opera to move people's hearts and evoke aesthetic feelings depends not only on the completeness of the roles and the compactness of the plot, but also on the setting off of the instruments, which plays a quite important role.</p>
<p>Today's Peking opera uses the huqin, yueqin, sanxian, and other instruments to accompany all arias. There are many instruments. In the past, the arias were all accompanied by two flutes. This was both tiring and inflexible for melodic turns. Therefore, all tunes at that time emphasized robustness and solidity, striving for strength and simplicity, not seeking gentleness and delicacy. Later, Wang Xiaoshao of the Sixi Troupe took the lead in abolishing the flute and replacing it with the huqin, which made the accompaniment feel more harmonious than before, and was deeply praised by the general public. However, Tian Xinwang of the Gongtong Troupe strongly opposed it. Tian demanded to dominate, and many people feared him. Although they knew that the creation of the huqin was more convenient than playing the flute, they did not dare to offend Tian, so they agreed on a compromise: to pull the huqin during performances for patrons, and to continue playing the flute during performances in the troupe.</p>
<p>The huqin is extremely pleasant to the ear for its ability to follow the melody and adjust the tune, as it is flexible and easier to use than the flute, so the number of learners increased day by day, and all troupes adopted it one after another. Although Tian insisted on dissent, the general trend was over, and he lacked the means to stop it. The old-school flute playing gradually became silent and eventually faded into obscurity.</p>
<p>The huqin created by Wang Xiaoshao was originally a soft bow. If one's wrist strength was not strong enough, it would not be effective, and many people suffered from it. Then there was Li Si, who created a hard bow huqin, which proved to be easier and more pleasing. The huqin went through several reforms before it was perfected. Then Jia San and Fan San (Cheng Changgeng's qin player) and others all switched to hard bows, which was generally praised for its convenience. The soft bow huqin also suffered natural elimination like the flute. Only Han Mingde, who played the qin for Tan Xinpei's Chun Gui troupe when he first went south, still used the soft bow. It was the last glimmer of a dying art. After that, the soft bow huqin became a thing of the past. This is the general outline of the evolution of the huqin.</p>
