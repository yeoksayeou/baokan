<h3>日本臨時議會之檢討</h3>
<p>於本月十五日開幕的日本第七十七次臨時議會，是此次東條首相就任不久之際建議予以召集的。照向例，日議會集會期在每年十二月中旬，開幕之後卽暫吿休會，到來年一月再開始議事；現在距離循例召集之期僅隔一月，而東條竟迫不及待，以非常會議性質予以提早召集，當此美國甫經修正中立法案來栖又復赴美進行最後談判之際，此舉自然引起世界各方的一致注視，甚至有人準備要從此一議會的結果去判斷日本政策的何去何從。</p>
<p>檢討五十年來的日本議會史，誠然不容否認其曾在日本政治上演過重大作用而尤以第一次歐戰後的十餘年間為其黃金時代；但是根據日本憲法的規定：日議會的主要權能只是立法協贊權與預算協贊權，此外租稅的徵課與增加也必須經過議曾的同意，但却和並世各民治國家立法機關之擁有無上權力者大異其趣，舉凡國家大計的決定與政府機關的人事都不一定要受議會方面的拘束。「五一五事件而後，日本政局全失憲政常軌，歷屆內閣都以「非常」性質而吿成立，對議會關係日見疏隔，而尤以去歲近衛倡導「新政體制運動」之際，準備改革議會，使其機能止於「翼贊」，一時議員噤若寒蟬，政黨紛紛解散，結果雖毫無成就，却使已同餼羊的議會越發奄奄無牛氣。時至今日，如果說日政府當局一定要等得到議會同意纔能決定內外大計，在任何人當皆知其不然，則所謂束條準備使議會投票決定太平洋和戰問題者，顯然上只以西方民治國家的常例來比附日本的「非常時」政治，自屬一無是處。臨時議會的召集，固不容否認其意義重大，但却是在日政府當局政策決定之後再通過議會以取得全國的廣泛贊助，而不是由議會的贊否以決定其進退——卽使這樣去做，也只是形式問題，其眞正決定權是不在國會的。因為，第一，日本議會始終還握有憲法所賦予的大權——通過法律及預算，核准增加租稅；第二，在日政府和人民之間，議會始終還是一個重要的中介，尙非「大政翼贊中央協力會議」之類所能代替。在日本議會制度未經根本改變之前，無論政府當局具有何等强大權力，關於此類問題仍不能不需要議會的協助，這一點。大槪就是東條召集臨時議會的主因。東條在今天所預備發表的施政方針固可重視，但更値得注意的却是其確立戰時體制的議案，三十八萬萬元的臨時軍費追加預算案，六萬萬到七萬萬元的新增稅案，以至「適應國內新體制準備之追加預算案」，總而言之，都是為了加緊促進「臨戰準備」的完成也就是日政府所視為最中心的任務。對此種種，日本人民究竟具何觀感不可盡知，但就近年日議會所表現的情勢來看，顯然不能對之襄有重大期待，齊籐隆夫一類的見解卽使並未絕跡，大槪也不再有人敢勇敢的重蹈其覆轍。</p>
<p>至於日本未來的動向，與其等待臨時議會的結果，無寗去審視當前國際大勢與日政府種種設施，到更能得到一個明確槪念。在這兩種情勢之間，目前正存在着一種矛盾：後者銳意擴展並向着備戰之途邁進，尤其自東條內閣成立後，一方政務和戰略已融為一體，另方內部的嚴密統制亦吿完成，以此與其業已遂行的「全國總動員」一高度國防體制建設」相互配合起來，其將以戰爭手段遂行擴展意欲殆有不能自已之勢。但是另一方面，在國際現勢上，日本却正臨到一個空前艱困的難關；對於膠着的中日戰局已吿抽身無術，更因ABCD陣綫的加緊合作，英美最後決心的宣示與在遠東應變準備的完成，又使日本在整個太平洋上臨到一個苟行蠢動則立卽四面遭受包圍的難關，無論南進北進或西進都有相當困難。其相與結託的納粹，縱能獨霸歐陸，在歐陸之外則實力幾等於零，海上的剽襲與對蘇的攻略都遠不足以達到應援日本的程度。日本主覜的情態如彼，國際大局的形勢若此，只要理智的控制未失，必可瞭然這絕不是可以鹵莽滅裂從事的時機。因為這一矛盾形勢的存在，所以儘管內有極端份子戰爭狂熱之包圍，外有英美堅定立塲之宣示，東條內閣却仍舊要派來栖遠涉重洋去做最後的斡旋，雖然並不見得能提出可為民治國所接受的方案。是以在此度日議會中，可科東條所宣示的態度大概可能是一種富有機變性質的彈性政策，但也毫不放鬆「臨戰」的配置與準備，而且至低限度，亦當以「決心解決中國事變」為主要基調。這一情勢，卽使表面尙形緩和，却不容諱言其內在的一觸卽發的危險性，這正是各個關係方面所當加以絕大敬覺的。</p>
<h3>莫斯圖電台宣布蘇軍在全線獲勝　德建堡壘作過冬準備</h3>
<p>路透社十六日倫敦電　莫期科無綫電臺宣布、蘇軍在起自北冰洋止於南方之陣綫上迭獲勝利、德軍擬渡達北冰洋漁民半島之舉、但卒歸失敗、軸心船二十艘被擊沉、喀萊里亞陣地敵方之砲位皆為蘇砲一一擊毀、敵軍屢圖進攻但皆未成、蘇機在列寗格勒陣地低飛攻擊、對裝載軍米與供應品之德方卡車隊加以摧毀、德軍在都拉途中（莫斯科南一百十哩）之喪失日見增多、德方正面攻擊之計畫、業巳失敗、而側擊蘇軍之謀亦復無效、據莫斯科所接南陣綫之消息、頓河區域之高加索軍隊、在過去三十五天中、無日不殲減進犯之敵兵、梭雅夫加地方發生劇戰、德軍初得利、但高加索騎兵反攻之、以寡敵衆、將德軍逐入河中、德軍後復進攻、梭雅夫加易手五次、但德軍最後非陣亡即溺死河中、聞德方共喪失五聯隊、德方無綫電臺之軍事報吿員昨夜稱、東陣綫德軍進行徐緩、乃氣候異常所致、大雨如注、道路濘泥、而勁風大作、尋常在一月中旬以前無此風雨、故軍行較夏季為緩、但最後勝利擊於德軍士氣云、蘇方最近公報稱，各陣地昨皆有戰事十一月十四日德機被學落四十四架、蘇機亦喪失十架、十五日日莫斯科付近擊落德機四架云、</p>
<p>路透社十六日倫敦電據此問所接最近消息、納粹雖繼續猛烈進攻、但蘇軍巳在許多區域取得主動之地位、德人現正沿全部長一二〇〇哩之前綫、建築堡壘與機關槍　位、顯係作冬季固守陣綫之準備、</p>

<p>路透社十六日華盛頓電中立法修正案、雖須至星期一日始發生效力、但據此間負責方面消息、若干美國商船現正裝置砲位、而各港水兵刻亦正分配中、以便下星期中裝載接濟品直往英國、海軍部當然不宣布其保護美商船之計劃、但現有軍艦隨船護送之若干氣象、據紐約消息、航務委員會目前擬每週多派商船三艘渡大西洋而往英國、今後新造貨船將陸續下水、每週約有三艘、此項新貨船皆設有架砲地位及若干秘密自衛特點、海軍界聲稱、刻在海上之商船、返後亦將武裝·估計美國一千二百艘商船、將有三百艘安置三吋與五吋砲位，</p>
<p>合衆社十六日華盛頓電美國船隻及飛機護航武裝商船經大西洋時、可利用英國根據地、俾美國之戰事物品可天量運至英國、官方對此報吿拒絕作任何批評、但權威界稱、「此為合理之猜測」因有此新路程航行之美輪、應獲得一色完密之保護、因上週國會中立法修止案獲得通過後、商船可駛入交戰區及交戰口岸、而美國大西洋艦隊可利用該新根據地、俾得保護商船也、</p>

<p>歐戰　談</p>
<h3>法國政界的女禍</h3>
<p>她也想物色一人，作為她進身之階。達拉第似乎比他人更中她的意思，却不知他處有其表，名小說家杜德曾說：這頭野牛，祇有蝸牛的觸角。達拉第身體壯碩，帶點粗氣，是一位碰植拍凳的朋友。他新賦悼亡，遺下二子，正在點然傷神，不料以一個南部小鎭的麺包師之子，竟能獲得侯爵夫人的靑睞，無怪他要受寵若驚了。</p>
<p>他見這位女子關心他的健康，評論他的衣着，掛念他的前途，於是感恩知已，傾心相向，她巳在不知不覺之中，把他從來不敢自承的野心引起了</p>
<p>這班女子，無不任情縱樂。一位美術商的風流寡婦紀佑穆夫人，曾和薩勞同謀，泰狄歐則在法蘭西話劇院名角馬爾蓋的起居室中辦公，桌上放着一張泰狄歐的照相，上面寫着：「給我的小賣貝，她的保護者謹贈。」只在一點，便可見他倆的情好逾恒了。</p>
<p>在弗爾小姐的家裹，我們又可聽到外交部秘書長雷瑞用詩人的才情和聲調，發揮他對於外交政策的意見。急進黨的會集地點，則在春風滿面的希雷塔夫人家裏，夫入却靠着她川流不息的朋友，周旋於社會主義派和中央派之間。</p>
<p>在蒙高美伯爵夫人白緞裝飾的客廳裹，我們又可會到要人中的頂兒尖兄，裹面有報界鉅子，有各部總長，也有各國大使。</p>
<p>達爾古公爵夫人的丈夫，是一個代議士，她却主張和德國接近，她常在交際宴會中向最有勢力的國會議員，亞倍茲和　堡等人發表她的意見，亞倍茲從前是卡斯路的藝術敎授，初無籍藉之名，其後成為德外長里賓特洛甫的親信，在一九三九年八月，曾因間諜罪被法國驅逐出境，現在却重回巴黎，做了德國的駐法大使了。　堡是德國弗朗克孚日報的通訊員，名噪一時，一九一二七年時，有一巴黎女子竟為他殉情自殺，在德車侵法以前，他是德國派駐比京不魯塞爾間諜團的領袖。</p>
<p>即使是最莊重的人，也抵抗不了女性的誘惑。說話帶着尖聲，高領結，黑絲襪的芒台爾，耍算容貌冷峻的了，但一見馬奇諾前夫人法蘭西劇院黃　白膚的勃萊蒂，也為之顚倒不置，而甘拜石榴裙下。</p>
<p>另一個法國女優黑髮美人盧愛爾，也鼓勵着人民陣綫政府的外交部長台爾博斯。</p>
<p>前任總理旭當，雖為人謹飭，却被鋼琴名家杜朗戴克斯特夫人的纖纖玉指玩諸掌上，他雖巳兒孫滿堂，然為美色所惑，竟不惜與髮妻離異，同時也為他的夢裹情人，嫁給他法律事務所中一位幫辦做妻子的女人，拆散了鴛鴦。</p>
<p>法國秘密團體共濟會，對旭當本極信仰，見他這樣荒唐，便與之決裂。他却不以為意，五月十六日，德軍乘勝前進之時，旭當還招待法國報界談話，說道：一諸位先生，我報吿你們一個好消息！我仍是個有能力的人，我的新夫人，剛正生了一個孩子。」</p>
<p>我們也不要冷落了彭古，他是國際聯盟會法國的常駐代表，也是法蘭西話劇院范都拉小姐的保護人。他曾有一封從日內瓦寫給鄷當瑞的一封信，內云：「我一想到你的可愛的玉體，中歐的混沌，我一點也不再咒詛了。」鄷當瑞曾一度為墨索里尼的情婦，法國駐義大使尙伯蘭，曾因干涉墨索里尼和她的好事而受到斥責。</p>
<p>法國的政治，就是這樣的操縱於紅粉佳人之手，一切政治的變動，都是她們野心和陰謀的結果，當內外交困之時，依然醉生夢死！革命聲浪，到處可聞，戰禍迫於眉睫，一九三八年的恐慌時期旋即到來，捷克竟被德國佔領，於是乎有慕尼克的會議。</p>
<p>海倫鮑爾特是贊成慕尼黑會議的，萊諾却激烈反對此事</p>
<p>遠在一九三四年時，海倫偶為二豎所侵，便赴維也納療養，在當地與德奧兩國的許多國社黨領袖相識，到了今日，還有若干方面指責她為希特勒的手下所收買，利用她及她和萊諾的關係，並說海倫會因為他們出力而獲過好幾次報酬，實則她本當有私蓄，又靠萊諾的指導而日增月盛，所以這種指摘，我們不敢相信。可是她的醉心權勢，酷愛謀，則毫無疑問。</p>
<p>有一時期，她是哈布斯堡的政治代辦，後來却反戈相向，她甚至還趕到比利時，拜訪流亡在外自稱法國王位繼承人的祁士公爵，雖然萊諾是一個醉心共和的人，但她必已向公爵擔保萊諾　為他出力。她的夢想是要使萊諾傾心於她，做她政治陰謀的愧儡，萊諾曾拒絕阻碍人民陣緩的實騐，還說要組織一個混合內閣，自共產以至極右的各黨各派，將兼收並蓄，可是萊諾愈向左傾，海倫却愈向右傾。</p>
<p>慕尼克會議以後，客廳交際已相習成風，德法協定之說，亦流行一時。巴黎社會的一班英雌，皆以和平主義，現實主義和反共主義為口頭禪，藉美色為鈞餌，以左右政界中人</p>
<p>戈林借着柏林舉行狩獵展覽會的名義，將那巴黎取具勢力的夫人小姐，如蒙高美，海倫飽爾特，達爾古，和克魯沙侯爵夫人等，乘機請到他輝煌富麗的家庭中，曲意聯歡。因此她們回國之時，腦海中祇記得窮極奢華的景象，和甘美動人的霄詞。她們巳被納粹所打動了，到了本國，便想去打動她們的友人。</p>
<p>可是萊諾却不肯同意，他宣稱法國巳進入一不流血的戰爭時期。」他對法國的中產階級痛下針砭，說他們的政治觀念皆係竊自外國，「從前人們剽竊法國的觀念，現在的中產階級却在自掘墳葬，和大革命前的貴族所為如出一轍，不過昔日的貴族尙係含笑而亡，今日的中產階級則不啻為自己執紼。」</p>
<p>像這樣的到了一九三九年夏天。達拉第本無決斷，克魯沙侯爵夫人的勸吿，更使他徬徨無主，直到最後的一秒鐘，方始宣戰。</p>
<p>無可避免的事情，終於到來了。</p>
<p>海倫曉得她時運巳至。她必須採取迅雷不及掩耳的手段。事實上，法國皆巳歸心萊諾，他將成為第二次世界大戰中的克萊孟梭了。達拉第眼看萊諾的人望益孚，侯爵夫人更繼續不斷地把萊諾的一切計劃吿訴達拉第。（未完）</p>

<p>據工部局淸報處公布、本埠進口商協會、業巳提出第一批另售物價、計有三百餘　之多、均屬外國伙食公司與藥房所經售之物品、業經兩租界工部局核准、作為最高售價、並經公布於本（十七）日各西文報紙、以備另售商人與用戶之參考、此項物品、因其名目繁多、且係進口貨物、迻譯需時、故華文報紙小及同時刋佈、各另售商經售上項物品者、自本月十八日起、務須依照限價發售、不得超出、並應盡量以供應顧客之常前需要為限、詳細價目、見本日各西文報紙不局第五五九六號布吿）、要於後批價目表、一經獲得、當予陸續刊布、</p>
<p>粉商計劃偷運出境</p>
<p>自本市當局統制物價後、麺粉囤戶、於最近數日內、曾用種種方法、擬將麵粉數千包、秘密遷出租界、圖運往華北、以獲善價、現巳為工部局所查悉、已予以制止、聞麵粉商計劃運出租界之麵粉、約逾一百萬袋、最近工部局突發禁止移動之命令、實出麵粉商意料之外、聞前日曾有貨船數十艘、滿載麵粉、圖運離租界、均遭工部局制止、物主羣·集工部局物價統制處、要求准予放行、均經貝特遜氏拒絕、並加以驅逐、據貝特遜氏吿記者、載運麵粉、須經工部局檢騐、方得核准、因有合法理由運輸麵粉、自可核准、聞經工部局之經濟戰略後、麵粉價格、已傾跌、麵粉囤戶損失頗鉅、貝特遜氏並望公衆及報界、予以援助、</p>
<p>煤斤獲滙需要又减</p>
<p>本市正當煤商採辦烟白煤斤、巳可獲得鉅額外滙、嗣後煤斤運滬、將益湧旺、一般煤斤囤戶、不無惶恐、亟求將國貨抑價出籠、邇日煤市塲現貨、巳呈供過於求、但人心疲憊、均無意高價扒吸、故現貨去路頗為滯呆、整個煤市、刻已呈一蹶不振之局面、據各煤業公團消息、烟白煤斤無論高次各貨售價、均已蛟諸半月前下降一。二百元一頓、如照現市售價出籠、各持貨煤商尙可獲有極豐厚之利潤、本市（包括浦東·虹口·滬西·法租界）各煤棧存底、現仍極度充實、據熟悉煤市者估計、現在存煤巳增達至四十八萬噸左右、倘以各用戶工廠等所購進之煤斤在內、全市存煤當在五十萬噸以上、而最近因煤價激增、各用戶均已减省用途、故每月需煤數量、業巳减退、在此到湧銷呆之時、煤棧存底將益見充實、</p>
<p>最近成交十五萬噸</p>
<p>據各大煤公司消息、邇日各煤商為未雨綢繆、繼續增厚煤棧存底起見、均紛紛致電海外各產煤區，繼續訂購大宗烟白煤斤，據悉交近十日以內、巳分別成分煤斤達十五萬噸以上、每噸產價僅及美金二·三元、輸運水脚雖勝過產價尙有厚利、目前在市塲買賣之現貨、則大部係前所運抵、每噸獲利潤尤鉅、</p>
<p>投機囤米已屆末日</p>
<p>關於何者為第二步統制之重要物品、工部局官員拒絕透露、據云、如是始可使囤戶無從捉摸、據悉、若干種物品囤積抬價之風、仍未稍止、惟巳為日無多據悉、工部局物價統制處、巳將各處米棧存米、列一表格、以便查核、此後囤米壟斷之大患、當可遏止、而自工部局規定米價後、米蠢所受損失、竟達六千餘萬元之鉅、過去數星期中、工部局官員管理物價、頗著功續、</p>

<h3>商團接管美軍防區　英美已予同意　撤軍專輪何日到滬昨日尙無確實消息</h3>
<p>美駐滬第四海軍聯隊留駐上海、尸有十四年悠久歷史、於接獲亞、艦隊總司令赫　上將自　尼刺發出命令撤退後、卽於最短促之時間內、準備撤退手續、據消息靈通方面稱、駐滬美國海軍陸戰隊司令霍華德上校、昨日曾致函日本海陸軍當局、以撤退一事通知日方、但此說至昨晚猶未能經美國海軍陸戰隊方面所證實、可時、昨日據美國領事當局透示、華盛頓並未有撤僑之新訓令擔滬、</p>
<p>撒軍專輪尙無確訉</p>
<p>至於撒退美防軍之船隻、一說係留駐馬尼刺而未駛離遠東海岸夕美總統輪萬倍倫號、該輪為美航務部最新建造鉅型輪隻之一、與柯立芝總統輪同稱為姊妹船、此次原定處女航來上海、該輪現泊香港船塢、不日即可解纜駛滬、但一說將來戰美防軍者、乃美運輸艦漢得遜號、該運輸艦巳由太平洋鼓浪來滬、又有謂已派塔虎脫總統輪担任、由馬尼刺來滬、並有第一批於三日內由美驅逐艦護送離滬說、但以事關軍事、美海軍第四聯隊總部、不願有所表示、據稱在滬之美軍七百五十名、北平美軍一百六十五名、決定於兩星期以內、全部撤退竣事、</p>
<p>商團接防英美同意</p>
<p>駐滬美軍司令霧華德上校、將於最後離滬、至美軍撤退後其所遺公共租界虞洽卿路以西蘇州河以南之防區問題、將作如何處置、頗為各方所關切、茲據探悉、工部局已微得英美同意、擬照去年八月間英軍撤退時之先例、交由工部局萬國商團接防、以該區關係英美權益至鉅也、至滬市美國官塲方面、對於撤軍問題、昨日仍保持絨默、惟若干方面認美國此舉、雖非對日備戰、但就美商船將武裝駛入交戰國領海事實、則美國業已放棄中立、則在華美車之撤退、固已暗示美國對遠東局勢今後所採之態度矣</p>
<p>華北美軍聞將來滬</p>
<p>美駐北平大使館衛隊防軍共五十五名、駐津防軍計一百六十五名、奉命撤退後、將專輪來滬集中、然後共同撤退、其首批撤退者將為三百名、而奉命來滬之船隻噸位甚大、足以容納、至於留滬美僑、迄目前止、猶無新命令再度撤退、質言之、原有撤僑令繼繼有效、英國在滬僑民英領署希望非必要婦孺、無特殊理由留在上海者、盼即撤退、</p>
<p>美軍營址登報出讓</p>
<p>亞洲地產公司、刻在報端登載廣吿、關於新路小沙渡路一帶美防軍之總指揮部及營房出讓、此蓋因美防軍撤退後、已不需應用、如有欲承租者、據該廣吿稱、可往靜安寺路九三四號該地產公司接洽</p>
<h3>聖那倍庭號　載煤抵埠　及水泥二千五百噸</h3>

<h3>租界內包飯作　禁止運入南市</h3>
<p>兩租界當局自將界內食米抑平售價以來、因此項洋米、完全由公共租界工部局所供給、故如有運入滬西及南市等非租界區域、均予禁止、而兩租界所有包飯作、如有承包南市及滬西等區包飯、昨日起均一律禁止送入、昨故日傍晚、大通社記者巡歷各昆連缺口、每處均停包飯數十担鵠立待放、結果仍不能送入、迄晚九時許、始完全散去汪經鎔</p>
<h3>螢光燈之裝置及　電力公司管理章程</h3>
<p>— 汪經鎔</p>
<p>根據上表可知如以六十週波之燈，用於五十週波之電流上，所發之光，雖較五十週波之燈，多百分之十，惟其耗電量亦較多百分之三十，壽命却减至不及五十週波燈之半，兩者相較，利弊立見，用戶為自身利益計，不可不加以注意。</p>
<p>電力因數</p>
<p>螢光燈具有一種特性，因此種特性之存在，其實在消耗之電量，常較發電機因而輸送之電量僅及百分之六十，換言之，發電機因某一螢光燈之需要，由雷綫輸出一百個單位之電流，祇其中之六十產生有用之工作，其餘四十，即循原路退回，故普通之錫絲燈，其電力因數為百分之百，而螢光燈之電力因數，僅為百分之六十，因其中百分之四十之電流，幷未發生效用，而輸送之費用，却並不因此减少，（電錢之容量仍須為百分之百）是以螢光燈乃屬於低電力因數之當氣用具，根據上海電力公司之章程，有裝置電力因數調整設備之必要。</p>
<p>校正原理</p>
<p>自螢光燈問世之後，頗多詢問何謂電力因數者，及何以要將電力因數加以校正者，非電學界中人，原不易明瞭此問題，茲試設譬，以說明之。</p>
<p>今以地毯之交易為例，某甲赴地毯店，請將地毯兩條送至其家，該店即僱人力車兩輛送往，結果某甲祗購其中之一條，其餘一條仍令送貨人載回，該店因多送地毯一條，退回之結果，遂致多付一條地毯之往返車資，目須多做一次記賬工作，未免損失，若果某甲常常如此，該店若不直接或間接向其收回此項服務之費用，定必不歡迎其光顧，因此種交易，甚不公道也。（一續）</p>
<h3>油船「武江」被覊禁　油遭卸岸</h3>
<p>日方自七月二十二日起、扣留英商亞細亞火油公司運油船武江號及其華籍船員十二人、迄今仍加　禁中、關於此事、未能從日當局探獲消息、惟聞日方對此、不久或將有所宣布、武江號係於七月間與美船一艘、運載火油沿長江口而行時、同被日方扣留、押返上海、美船旋即釋出、武江號則被禁泊於楊樹浦浜旁日方碼頭前卸油、船員亦遭扣禁、日方並不供給食物、故船主不行不以必需品供給船員十二人、英當局已因此數度提出抗議、惟日方答覆、以該船「無權在長江口航行」為言、</p>

<h3>美日經濟關係比較　一旦商業完全停頓彼此將受何種影響</h3>
<p>— 黃新夢</p>
<p>太平洋問題日見嚴重，美日戰爭好像有一觸即發之概，但近代戰爭的最後結果，還得要看交戰國經濟實力如何。因此，在這太平洋將有暴風雨的前夕，筆者要把美日經濟關係，用統計的目光，略述其梗概如次：</p>
<p>據一個經濟學專家目光中所看到的，日本在建設「東亞新秩序」的口號下，可以注意的問題有二：　美日的商業或許有完全停頓的一天；　日本可能干涉美國向海外進口的橡皮和錫，因爲這兩種物品，日本有力去統制的。</p>
<p>假如美日的商業關係完全切斷之後，那日本所受的損害將較美國爲重。第一，日本於一九三九年在美國方面，獲得很多所需要的外匯，而美國向日本所購的貨物，佔日本總出口的三三之一。其他日元集團的國家還不在其內。因爲自一九三七到一九三九，美國的蠶絲市塲，日絲佔百分至八十三，幾完全爲日本所有。假如這個市塲喪失之後，日本在經濟上，無疑將受到一大打擊，因爲可减去日本不少必需取得的外匯。</p>
<p>其次，日本的進口貨物，也大半仰給美國。一九三八年日本的進口貨物，美貨佔百分之三十四。關於此一方面，可恨顯明的看出足以削弱日本的戰鬥力量的，因爲關於軍用的重要原料，如汽油，鐵料，金屬製品，機器和銅等等，日本都向美國購買的。</p>
<p>日本依存美國</p>
<p>八種戰時應用原料，竟佔日本向美國進口總和的百分之九十八。下表所列，就是指出這八種原料，日本向美國進口者，和向別國進口者相較，所得的百分比是多少。</p>
<p>品名　百分比</p>
<p>汽油　六六</p>
<p>碎鐵　九一</p>
<p>鐵質混合金屬　九八</p>
<p>銅</p>
<p>九二</p>
<p>金屬和混合金　九九·六</p>
<p>汽車和汽車零件　七七</p>
<p>金屬製機器　七〇</p>
<p>飛機和飛機零件　六三</p>
<p>關於此一方面，日本處境，的確非常困難。三十二種重耍的軍用原料，日本自給有餘而出口者祇有兩種，適足自給的三種，本國所產不够自用而必須向他國進口者十六種，其他的十一種完全仰給於他國。一九三九年度日本的軍用原料，向美國進口者，佔百分五十六，英國佔百分之二十一，而向英屬馬來加那大和印度進口者佔百分之八。因此，英美一旦合作，實行對日斷絕商業關係之後，日本將受到最嚴　的影響。</p>
<p>此種合作，如屬可能，就可减少日本鋼鐵，汽油，機器　，和次要的銅的供給。雖日本　一朝處此情形之下，未始不可向他處購買，如聚合供應，經濟用途，加緊在日本本部和淪陷區域的生產等，都可取法，但結果一定會感到分散和加高成本，這很明顯的可削弱日本的戰鬥力量的。</p>
<p>輸美日貨何用</p>
<p>我們在另一面，可注視一下美國的情形。下表所列，就是美國向日本進口的重要商和向品別國進口的百分比是如何。</p>
<p>品名　百分比</p>
<p>魚片和魚油　五二</p>
<p>陶器和磁器　五一</p>
<p>絲織品　四二</p>
<p>破布　九九·五</p>
<p>棉織地毬　九九</p>
<p>蟹肉醬油等　八一</p>
<p>油角　七七</p>
<p>鮮花　七二</p>
<p>玩具　六六</p>
<p>帽料　五五</p>
<p>漂白棉布　五二</p>
<p>很明白的可以看出這些東西，都不是十分重耍的。雖然一九三八年度美國向日本進口的生絲有百分之九十四，但絲於國民生活，亦不致有重要關係。</p>
<p>但上面的統計，還是沒有完全，我們可進一步，想到美國有朝一日，進口的橡膠和錫完全被日海軍切斷以後情形將怎樣？</p>
<p>整個世界上面的橡樹膠，在遠東方面生產者差不多佔百分之九十八·一九三九年度，美國進口的橡膠，値價達美金一萬六千七百萬元之鉅，橡膠的重要，也有甚於其他的出品，內中百分之五十七購自英屬馬來，百分之一十八購自荷屬東印度，其他由法屬印度支那及錫蘭島供給。</p>
<p>世界上鍚的產量，大概四分之三產於馬來聯邦，玻利維亜，和荷屬東印度。美國一九三八年度進口的錫，量的方面，百分之七十四購自馬來。此外購自不列顚本國者百分之七荷屬東印度及香港百分之七，其他各國百分之十三。</p>
<p>就上文所說，美國橡膠和鍚的進口，完全靠馬來聯邦和荷屬東印度的供給是很明白的可看出的。但萬一發生意外，這兩處進口遭遇阻碍後，美國又是否可另找其他市塲供應呢？</p>
<p>美國出路正多</p>
<p>美國一年所需用的橡膠是多少，根據稅務委員會最近的報吿，一九三九年度，美國所消耗的橡膠是五十九萬一百噸，每磅的價格一角七分，但到一九四〇年已漲到二角了。</p>
<p>在未來一年中，美國已訂立合同，但需要的橡膠是多少，關於這，我們可回想到一九三九年六月，美國會向英國議定，英國以八萬五千噸樹膠向美國交換棉花六萬包。到一九四〇年八月，照合同上所開橡膠數量，一半已經交貨。橡膠儲備公司和金融建設公司有密切關係，曾在美政府方面獲得借款一萬四千萬元，訂有合同，預備在未來一年中，交足橡膠十八寓噸，每磅的價格，自一角七分到二角。</p>
<p>其他的來源方面，人造橡膠並非是重要因素，因爲價格很高，每磅要六角五分。雖然到了大量製造，充分可供給美國美要時，可低至每磅一二角。但生產到達這個數量，至少怕還要隔三年之久。</p>
<p>提煉過的橡膠，一九三九年度，美國所消費者達十七萬噸。據專家的統計，到了發生意外時，美國各橡膠廠可生康提煉的橡膠三十萬噸。</p>
<p>同時，鼓勵南美各國增加橡膠的生產，是極端的熱望着。大概十年之後，就可達到此目的，不過問題在需要美國的大量投資和根除南美橡樹葉上的蟲傷病態。</p>
<p>關於橡膠，我們可得到下面一個結論。美國的存底是很薄的，就一九四〇年八月調查所得，那時美國的存底，僅足供四個月的用途。最樂觀的統計，作算美國橡膠的存底，假如進口斷絕了，可供「年的用途。這個統計，完全以經濟為根據，到了那時，不需要的實業，將减少或消滅橡膠的消費，加上向英國進口的。十二個月的過程，很可使美國硏究改用人造樹膠和向南美進口了。</p>
<p>同時，我們要想到增加向荷屬東印度及馬來聯邦的進口，也很重要。關於此一問題，要看國際橡膠統制委員會的態度，這個委員會大半由英國統制，決定有多少橡膠，可以出口。過去一年，他們的政策，完全顧全美國的利益，勿受絲毫影響，因此，速往美國的數量，也是不少，而很够消費了，就是價格，也訂得相當的合理。</p>
<p>另一個結論，就是可看到美國的橡膠問題，非常嚴重，但並非不能解決的。大半要看一旦問題發生，橡膠的運輸如何，而目前美國是否即作準備。但另一問題便是英國雖也及收一部，而橡膠的來源，却大半靠亞洲供給。國際方面，有人統制以後，就會使美國遭遇困難。就是玻利維亞，到那時可供給大量的錫產，但由於種種原因，可看到玻國的錫，向來由英國購去大部。</p>
<p>美國曾用種種方法，考慮到錫發生恐慌時如何防止一問題。同時，已得到國際錫產委員會的同意，每年准許美國購買五千噸，而最後尋找錫的其他市塲，也値得提出討論的。然而美國目前錫的存底，究有多少，確實的統計，外間很少知道。不過無論如何，要是運輸問題早一天發生障礙，雖然不是致命的打擊，問題可總是而　的。</p>
<p>日本是致命傷</p>
<p>最後的結論，我們可以說如果美日的商業關係，特別是由美國主動或由英美合作推動，完全斷絕之後，可證明日本所受的嚴重性較美國爲更甚。假如日本力足阻止美國橡膠和錫的進口，美國也將受到影響，因為這兩種重要物品的進口，一定要减少了。然則難不倒美國，日本所受的打擊，那就有如致命之傷。</p>
<p>本文所述完全以經濟問題爲立塲。雖然日後的演變，將以關係國的政策和戰略爲依歸，但大部分要看今後美國對遠東所採取的政策如何，而確定最後的命運呢！</p>
<h3>局米平糶辦法　憑證購買制芻議</h3>
<p>— 張啟裕</p>
<p>本篇所擬改善局米出售辦法的目的，旨在使眞正消費的食戶，能用最簡單的方法，最少數的人力，去獲得其所需米糧。</p>
<p>就我管見所及，似可在下列原則下，實有憑證購買制度：與當局及各界人士共商榷之</p>
<p>（一）實施本制之目的，爲使局辦洋米能得合理分配，杜絕居奇操縱，並减輕市塲米奸之威脅。（註）</p>
<p>（二）欲購公賣米者，必須先經申請手續，憑證購買。申請發證人，憑其最近一月之住屋房捐票向就近捕房，公董局，工部局，或指定之米店，或消費合作社，塡寫印就指申請書。房捐票留存備查，由收取申請書者，給以副聯收據爲憑</p>
<p>（三）申請書內，必須塡明：全屋內食米之人口數，實足每月收入約數，申請前兩個月內購得米糧之方法，種類，及重量，現在住址，以及其他如：有無機關米貼或在機關進膳等重要事項；美月所需請購米量，亦應斟酌註明；一戶之中，如已有購辦米糧尙存若干者，應亦聲明之。申請負責人並須在申請書後簽名蓋章，或用手印代替；以備將來獲得核准通吿後，憑副聯收據及原存印式領取購米證。不論照准與否，房捐票，亦憑副聯收據領回</p>
<p>（四）購米證之塡發，由兩租界當局合組·審查委員會附設調查組辦理之。容核手續，須於接到申請書之日起七日內辦竣。</p>

<p>（六）審查委員會核發購米證時，除依據申請人只經濟狀况及調查所得報吿外，有權增减其所申請之數量，且不得超過下列標準：</p>
<p>（甲）十五歲以上，每月每人米二斗二升半。</p>
<p>（乙）十歲以上至十五歲，每月每人米二斗。</p>
<p>（丙）五歲以上至十歲，每月每人米一斗。（註）</p>
<p>（七）購米證上，應按購米證登記淸冊之分區方法，註明爲第幾區；此證僅存區內有效向經售處購買局米。證上並編有號碼，又詳列負者申請人姓名，性別，年齡，住址，職業等項；關於核准米量，則用中文及阿刺伯字母並列，與購米證之號數，同在其上蓋以刺狀硬印，防止塗改。</p>
<p>（八）購米證之有效截止期，應一律，如一月底，四月底，七月底，十一月底。滿期後，一概須重行塡具申請書，由審查委員會重行根據事實及調查報吿核給新證。</p>
<p>（九）審查委員會於實發購米證時，應分區彙登購米證登記淸冊，除存局外，並印發各經售米店或消費合作社備查。</p>
<p>（十）凡市內各機關之現成消費合作社或米店，願代售分配局眯者，經聲請核准後，應服從局方之監督，而由局方予以規定值合理利潤。</p>
<p>（十一）經售各處，如確係服務優良，卓著成績者，經調查屬實，由局方予以獎勵，並公佈其姓名，以資褒揚。</p>
<p>（十二）局方應劃一核發各經售處以特定式樣之印鑑，以便檢查；此印鑑，局方得收取代刻之成本。</p>
<p>（十三）經售各店社，於出售局米前，應將呈閱之購米證與局方送保淸冊查對相符后，就限額內之米量出售：並於購米證照塡明處售日期，數量，上蓋局方所發印鑑；同時應備具專冊，登記購米證號數，出售數量，日期，及價格。（註）</p>
<p>（十四）購米證持有人，在證上規定之月額內，得不分次數，就規定區域以內之經售處，按照定價格購買局米；惟每次數量，不得少於一升。</p>
<p>（十五）每一個月核准之數量，不論有未購足，僅准在月內之日購用，不得轉嫁或預購至其他月份。</p>
<p>（十六）購米證不得頂替使用；必要時，得由局方註明於該證上，限定負責申請人自己使用之。</p>
<p>（十七）凡遇死亡，遷出，遷入，及出生等戶口異動，以致所需米量發生變動時，負責申請人如有需要，應據實報吿，重塡申請書，換發新證。</p>
<p>（十八）機關，團體，工廠，商號，學校等申請購米手續，除有特別規定外，均照普通住戶辦理。（註）</p>
<p>（十九）餐館，旅館，及食品經營業者，申請購米時，所需米量，應由該業同業公會證明估計，並造送申請前五個月內每月出售米量之統計表；其他準用普通住戶之規定。（註）</p>
<p>（二十）局方如查得申請人有虛報戶口及其他詐僞行爲，除酌悄懲　調查人外，得即日收回該申請人之購米證註銷之，並隨時知照各經售處其購米證之號數，使在淸冊上為同樣之註銷。此項被註銷之申請人，自註銷之日起三個月內無權再享申請之利益。（註）</p>
<p>（二十一）購米證如有二月以上，不爲利用，除原申請人能預先提供正當理由外，由局方查明屬實後，通知各經售處予以註銷；但此負責申請人得重行申請之。</p>
<p>（二十二）對虛報戶口及　購者，除拒售外，並得按情由捕房處罰其負責申請人。（註）</p>
<p>（二十三）經售處在普通營業時間內，不得拒售局米。</p>
<p>（二十四）經售人員或承辦購米證人員，如有舞弊納賄情事，應從嚴依法處罰。前項人員，包括調查員在內。（註）</p>
<p>（二十五）無論私人或團體機關，凡知申請人間有冒名頂替，意圖不法謀利，或有囤積嫌疑，而非供其實際消費者，得具名報吿就近各捕房，捕房對此吿密有絕對保守秘密之義務，如屬實在，當酌情略予獎勵。（十一月十日成於東吳法學院）</p>

<h3>敎養子女的一種工具　家書値萬金</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>想到了子女的敎養，有許多做父親的旅居在外埠，因此就不能每日盡敎誨的責任，這時候，家書就成爲敎育子女的一種有力的工具了。</p>
<p>有許多不善言辭而思想極高的父親，也可以利用書信的方式去敎導他們的子女，有許多子女在學校裏住宿的，家書的寫作也就成爲很重要的工作了。</p>
<p>中國歷代的許多名人學者，對於敎誨他們的子女，都是盡力的實行的，他們敎育的目標，是以勤，儉，孝，禮，好學和高潔為標準的，在商務印書館出版的歷代名人家書裏，有「食不梁肉，充饑而止，衣不文彩，蔽體而止」，「禹不愛尺鑾而愛寸陰」，「孝敬仁義，百行之首」，「遺子黄金滿　，不如一經」等精警的句語。</p>
<p>在諸葛亮誡干書中，有「夫君子之行，靜以修身，儉以養德，非澹泊無以明志，非寗靜無以致遠」等句，在史桂芳家書中，更有「陶侃運　，自謂習勞，蓋有難以直語人者，勞則善心生，養德養身咸在焉。逸則妄念生，喪德喪身咸在焉」等話，這種言行，即使在現代，也不會失去牲們的價値。</p>
<p>在美國，也有家書二十封那本書。是由一個富有的食品商，寫給他的兒子的，而由星六晚郵的主筆整理而成的，也有許多至理名言。例如關於敎育一點，他說：「當敎育在你的身旁的時候，你應該盡力去攫取，你將發覺敎育是這個世界散在各處的東西而每一個人可以毫無窮盡地去獲取的。」又說：「敎育最大的目的，是造成優美的性格，其次纔是智識。」全書充滿着幽默而具有至理的言語，成爲美國家庭中人人愛讀的一本好書。</p>
<p>在美國一個小市鎭中，有一個家庭，因爲所有的男孩子都在外埠，他們的母親就把從各地收到的家書收集起來，經過一番編輯的工作，用打字機打成好幾份，寄給每一個旅居外埠的兒子，這也是一個値得採取的方法呢。</p>

<h3>徵文揭曉之七冷酷的父親</h3>
<p>— 非霞</p>
<p>從我開始有記憶起，直到現在，我幾乎從來沒有見到過父親的笑容，這在我們親父女之間是一件生疏而不該的事。</p>
<p>我的家庭裏的經濟狀况不算十二分拮据，父親在一處　關俳職，每月又有　目頗可　的收入，維持一家六口的生活是不很艱難的，所以使父親變成冷酷的絕對不是經濟問題，而是由於一種習慣，一種長輩想對小輩維持威嚴的習慣。</p>
<p>每天早晨，父親便沉着臉，必恭必正地坐在沙發上看報紙，從第一面看到末一頁，像要把它吞下去似的，罕有的也許在室內踱步。這時候我們——他的子女，必須「正襟危坐」，等待着早餐，不然便會受到他的譴責，早餐後，便是我們的天下了，我們便飛也似的到學校裏去。</p>
<p>同樣的，當午餐或晚餐時，我們又可以見到餐桌的上首端坐着一位嚴酷的父親。</p>
<p>有時候我們兄弟姊妹們正在談笑，父親突然出現了，而空氣也突然緊張起來，談笑隨之停止，無知的弟妹便一個個地溜了出央，存在室中，僅有爸和我，我常常為道情景而悲傷，同時也替父親悲傷的我們二代間的感情怎麼為弄得如此糟呢？</p>
<p>非但如此，父親對於母親也十分生硬，談笑或討論在他們之間是不存在的，家中有甚麽事的時候，「合作」也是永遠辦不到的。</p>
<p>但奇怪的是爸和媽從來沒有吵過嘴。</p>
<p>父親和我們間的隔膜是會加深的，我顧慮到道點，所以我極力想趁隔膜尙可剷除時把它剷除。</p>
<p>有一次，我終於鼓足勇氣，走到正在看報的父親面前，喘囁地說。：</p>
<p>「爸爸！我想……我們……」</p>
<p>「唔！」父親抬起頭來，似乎頗厭倦地說。</p>
<p>我頓時覺得很難受，我再也不能說下去了，我的勇氣被父親的冷酷趕走了。</p>
<p>我開始替弟妹和自己憂鬱起來，全世界的少年都有一個甜密的家，而我們四個却絲毫享受不到。當我看到背影」時，我小禁流下淚來，我到反而羨慕貧苦的家庭祇要他們的父母是溫柔的，沒有父親的愛將成爲我生平的遺憾。（酬稿費十元贈家庭月刊全年十二期）</p>
<p>編者按　像菲霞女士所遭受的情形，在中國家庭中是屢見不鮮的，其實在外國何曾不是如此，在「閨怨」裏，巴萊德家的父親也不是一樣地冷酷的嗎。有許多父親，為着維持他們的尊嚴，擺出了冷酷態度，但是，也許他們有事務上的煩惱，所以到了家裹，不能顯出和顏悅色的慈容，我希望這些父親，不要把煩惱放在一個人的頭腦裹面，有時候和子女們談談說說，反可以消除煩惱，同時適可以享受家庭中的樂趣。至於做子女的如菲霞女士，不要多加顧慮，如果可能的，可以試試怎樣去使父親感到安　和快樂，家庭中的幸福，是要各人共同去努力尋求和創造的。下期徵文揭暁：鄉下妻子。</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>豆苗早又上市了，在菜蔬類中，也可算是一種雋品，因為它常和蝦仁結合一起的。凡是筵席中，往往少不了這樣豆苗炒蝦仁，雖在沒有豆苗之前，有靑豆作代表，而豆苗一出，可就取靑豆而代之了。蝦的代價，近來貴不可當，所以經濟家庭中的餐桌上，難得有豆苗炒蝦仁的地位。大的蝦雖然太貴，而小蝦也不妨吃吃，出了仁，就可和豆苗同炒了·要是不用蝦仁，那麽豆苗炒肉絲，也淸腴可口，倘是家裹有吃素的老太爺老太太，也可來一個淸炒豆苗，不過這東西也和金花菜一樣，油要用得重一些的。</p>

<p>哈同夫人羅迦陵的　吿中，我們看到有「……在八月一日，始斷為肺病，已入第三期，急用空氣針……」等語。以這樣一位擁有數萬萬大資產的富孀，住在偌大的愛麗園中，度着神仙般的生活，尙不免為肺病的犧牲者，其他人自更不用說了。</p>
<p>這全市的大敵，果然猖獗得令人不寒而慄，——據統計，上海四百萬人口中，至少有三十二萬人患着這可怕肺病——但是上海防癆協會却起來和它挑戰，願以最大的努力，撲殺此獠。我們感謝這幾位熱心人士，登高一呼，大家一致動員，來撲滅這癆魔！</p>
<p>與其說是為了別人而努力，而捐錢，乾脆的講，還不是為了我們各個自己。我們要保障自己的康健，先得要肅淸左右環伺着，擇人而噬的病魔。猶之救火，左鄰右舍的火熖不去設法撲滅，你能担保自己的房子不會遭殃麼？</p>
<p>撲滅全市肺癆，這是每一個人的責任，上海防癆協會諸君不辭艱鉅，倡導於前，全市民衆就應該一致起來贊助，使他們一百萬元的募捐目標，得以早日達到。我們還希望這種防癆工作能由這唯一大都市的上海，推廣而至全國各城市。使大家都知道這「白色恐怖」的可怕，從消耗性的病魔桎梏中求得永久解放。</p>
<h3>嬰孩和學步小孩　應該怎樣避免肺癆　和病人避免接觸　减少傳染機會</h3>
<p>— 滌淸</p>
<p>肺癆並不是生下來就有的。這可以給做母親的人們一個安慰的信念，肺癆並沒有遺傅性的。可說是一種傳染病，這種病菌，是肉眼所不能看見，常常由於看護小孩的大人們傳染得來的。</p>
<p>最重要的，是耍使小孩避免細菌傳染。不使任何息有肺癆的人，從他口腔的呼吸，唾涎，或是茶杯上，手巾上，食物上所遺留的細菌，傳給小孩。</p>
<p>患着肺癆病的任何人，父親，母親，親戚，看護，或其他熟識的人，只要和小孩親密的接觸，都是帶着危險性的。應當使小孩和這些人遠離，以减少傳染的機會。</p>
<p>困難問題來了。倘若這小孩的母親息着肺癆，那怎麽辦呢？做母親的應該犧牲些天性的愛子之情，使小孩免得染到肺病的危險，使小孩和母親隔窒居住，事質上或者不容易辦到。那末母親的一舉一動，必得隨時留意，唾痰，咳嗽，用手巾，都須留神病菌傳到孩子的口腔裏去。危險不會在於餵乳，却在於呼吸，咳嗽，用手撫摩。</p>
<p>牛乳和娘乳，同樣難免帶着病菌，所以除開經過肺癆檢查的牛乳，或消毒牛乳之外，均不宜採用。否則也應經過煮滾以後方可拿來餵給孩子吃。</p>
<p>旣經用了各種努力，保護小孩避免傳染，還要注意培養小孩的自然抵抗力。有幾種簡單的方法，須得努力的：</p>
<p>流通空氣　在嬰兒初生的幾個月裹，應該使嬰兒常在空氣流通的所在。當他睡眠時，在搖籃裏，要使他的面部常能空氣流通，使他的兩臂常能自由運動，這可以幫小孩肺部的擴張。房間裏的窗子，宜常開通。新鮮淸潔的空氣，是最需要的。</p>
<p>皮膚　有些做母親的，似乎是這樣想，孩子的皮膚，只要時加洗濯和撲撲粉就好了。其實除此以外，尙有其他値得考慮淸潔的事，因為皮膚除護蓋全身外，尙有其他的功能。在氣候溫和的時候，應該使小孩的皮膚多多赤裸，接受空氣和陽光。（未完）</p>

<p>十四　打英雄的生活</p>
<p>無奈這一張台的面積太大了，而他自己的年齡和體格，也眞不宜再使這樣的猛勁，好容易翻到台口邊，一個頭暈，便在地毯上　了一交。不用說，台下自然是一陣倒好，還夾着許多極難聽的喧笑聲，要不是他臉上抹着彩，眞可以使他沒有勇氣再從地上爬起來。</p>
<p>因為作弄他的目的已經達到，而他的「眞才實學」也已淸淸楚楚的試出來了，台上的幾個武行和張銀財自己，見了他便個個向他歪嘴吐舌的做鬼臉；在用傢伙對打的時候，他的背上和腿上，至少給他們用力戳了幾十下。</p>
<p>汗像夏天的雨一樣地傾瀉下來，秋海棠卸裝的時候，差不多混身全濕透了。</p>
<p>「老王，你瞧新來的那個傢伙多可憐，給你們今兒這麽掇弄你瞧，哭得到此刻臉上的眼淚還不曾乾咧！」一個唱小花臉的坐在大衣箱上，悄悄地向站在他旁邊的一個武行說。</p>
<p>那武行却只是乾笑了一笑。</p>
<p>秋海棠聽在耳朶裏，倒覺得很奇怪，他記得自己並沒有哭過，臉上倘的應該全是汗水，怎麽人家會當是眼淚呢？他一面這樣想着，一面便暗暗舉起手來，在眼凹裏摸了一下，不料睫毛上果然也是濕的，眞敎他自己也分不淸楚是汗還是淚了！（二六四）</p>

<h3>Kurusu Saburo Arrives in Washington; Scheduled to Meet with U.S. President Today; Acknowledges Difficulties but Aims to Complete Mission; Denies Carrying Any Personal Letters</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th: Japanese Special Envoy Kurusu arrived in Washington yesterday. Japanese Ambassador Nomura and U.S. State Department officials welcomed him at the airport. Kurusu stated that he was aware of the difficulty of his mission, but he felt there was still a chance to strive for its success. When Kurusu received reporters in New York, he said that there were few irreconcilable disputes between the U.S. and Japan. When asked about his views on the prospects for peace, Kurusu smiled cautiously and slowly, saying, "In the current situation, one person's efforts are too small; we must all support it." Local newspapers yesterday did not criticize Kurusu's arrival, but Kurusu will undoubtedly be uneasy about the headline reporting the withdrawal of U.S. sailors stationed in China and President Roosevelt's speech on Friday, as this speech is generally seen as frankly stating that the Far East situation contains dangerous elements that could lead to war. Kurusu's current remarks, such as expressing hope that he can obtain opportunities in Washington to make his mission a success, are vague. If Kurusu hopes to succeed in Washington, like a soccer player kicking the ball straight into the goal, then Kurusu will find the field extremely difficult to navigate. Well-informed sources felt that his mission would fail as soon as Kurusu arrived. Although the United States does not want a war in the Pacific, it will never violate its declared policies. All qualified observers have not seen the possibility that Kurusu will make major concessions that the United States can accept, while the United States still insists on conditions that these people believe are difficult for the Japanese military to agree to. Judging from the situation, possible concessions do not seem to bring the two sides closer. According to recent news from the East, Kurusu's mission is solely to observe whether the United States is bluffing or speaking truthfully. If the United States shows any signs of weakness, Kurusu can return home and give the green light to the Tojo cabinet to carry out its aggressive policies. But if the United States remains strong, Japan will neither advance north nor south, but only maintain its current position. If this is true, then Japan will definitely maintain its current position, because Kurusu will not only see the United States insist on its policies, but will now see the United States fully prepared to intensify its necessary economic pressure if Japan takes action.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th: Japanese Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu is preparing to have high-profile talks with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull tomorrow, which will determine the key to peace or war. Reliable sources say they believe Kurusu has new information regarding existing disputes between the two countries, but he has remained silent here and in New York. Before boarding a military plane to Washington from New York at 12:05 last night, he refused to answer questions from fifty reporters. Kurusu said he did not carry any personal letters to President Roosevelt. He said, "There are few completely irreconcilable situations in diplomatic history." Reliable sources in Washington yesterday described the U.S. policy and progress on various points in the recent negotiations: The United States and Japan fully agree to maintain peace in the Pacific. Regarding the issue of ceasing aggression, Japan has not yet provided satisfactory assurances to the United States. The United States has requested that the use of force be stopped in the implementation of national policy, and that interference in the internal affairs of other countries be stopped. Japan refused to agree to this, insisting that the situation in the Far East has special characteristics and requires special treatment. Washington has tried to adjust international issues in a peaceful way. Japan agreed to this in principle, but insisted that the situation in the Far East should be given practical consideration.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th: Well-informed sources predict that Japan will not take new offensives, but will continue to wage a war of nerves against Britain and the United States to await the results of the U.S.-Japan talks. If it fails, Japan will prepare for rapid action. Kurusu and Japanese Ambassador Nomura have had initial talks, preparing for important talks with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull tomorrow. Peace or war in the Far East will depend on these talks.</p>
<h3>Japan Says Kurusu's U.S. Visit Is a Last Effort</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 16th: Well-informed Japanese sources said today that Saburo Kurusu's U.S. visit represents the Japanese government's last effort to break the Pacific crisis. Developments in Washington in the next few days will be extremely important. It also stated that if the United States is truly willing to maintain peace in the Pacific, it should recognize Japan's strong determination to overcome any obstacles to complete its established policies. These sources pointed out that the special parliament, which officially opened this morning, is particularly important for uniting the 100 million people of the Japanese Empire to cope with any contingencies. The Hochi Shimbun predicted that Kurusu will frankly convey the facts to President Roosevelt and Hull, saying that Japan's patience has reached its limit at a time when the anti-Japanese encirclement of the U.S., Britain, China, and the Netherlands is intensifying. The newspaper said that the fate of the Pacific depends on the attitude of American leaders. The Nichinichi Shimbun said that Kurusu's mission is regarded as the last effort for peace in the Pacific. If the United States insists on its original attitude, then our country's peace enthusiasm, hope, and efforts cannot be optimistic. It also stated that Japan's basic policy of resolving the Sino-Japanese War and building a co-prosperity sphere remains unchanged. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that the Japanese government and people have resolved to protect their country in the crisis and are willing to make any sacrifices, and declared that before the parliament is held, "the fate of the Pacific is at stake."</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 16th: Scripps-Howard newspapers published an editorial in its newspapers yesterday, stating that if Britain and Japan accept President Roosevelt's "Atlantic Charter" promise that all countries must obtain equal treatment in world trade and raw materials, then peace in the Pacific is possible. The company said that if Japanese Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu brings genuine proposals, he will be heard with sympathy in Washington. We believe that if Britain and Japan work together, President Roosevelt's "Atlantic Charter" can provide a solid foundation for peace in the Pacific. If British Prime Minister Churchill guarantees this and jointly proposes friendly mediation in the Chinese war with President Roosevelt, then the key lies in Tokyo's reply.</p>
<h3>Canada Announces Sending Troops to Strengthen Defense of the Far East; First Batch of Troops Arrives in Hong Kong; Burma Expands Ban on Imports of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 16th: Canadian Prime Minister King recently announced the news of Canadian troops arriving in Hong Kong. The number of troops was not announced, but it was only stated that they will form the defense force of Hong Kong together with other Imperial troops. It also stated that these troops will be led by Brigadier Lawson. King also said that defending against real or threatened aggression in any part of the world is part of the defense of all countries that still enjoy freedom today. Based on this view, the Canadian government believes that it should send Canadian troops to cooperate with troops from other parts of the British Commonwealth currently stationed in East Asia.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 16th: This morning, the citizens here woke up and suddenly saw a large transport ship, accompanied by several escort ships, entering the port and unloading the Canadian troops it was carrying. These troops were transferred here to strengthen the garrison force. It was kept strictly confidential beforehand, and the citizens had no knowledge of it. However, after the news of the arrival spread, the streets of Kowloon were filled with welcoming people waiting for the troops to march past. The first to board the ship were the Governor of Hong Kong and the Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in Hong Kong, Major General Maltby, who formally welcomed the Canadian commander to land. At the same time, reporters from various newspapers surrounded the Canadian soldiers to seek news information. Many of the Canadian troops participated in the last Great War. Many of them have also served overseas in this war. Several officers told reporters that although they did not know the details of their mission here, they were prepared to assume any responsibility. The voyage lasted several weeks and was safe and uneventful. The weather was good and no enemy ships were found. The troops landed in very good order. They first gathered at the parade ground opposite the pier. After the entire army gathered, they marched through the main streets of Kowloon with a military band leading the way, and Major General Maltby held a review. The magnificence of the military appearance left a deep impression on the onlookers, and the arrival of these troops has had a great effect on the morale of the Chinese residents. Currently, various arrangements have been made for the comfort and happiness of the Canadian soldiers here, with particular attention to sports.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 16th: General Pownall, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East, recently telegraphed his welcome to the Canadian troops arriving in Hong Kong, saying that he was very pleased to have Canadian troops stationed in the area under his command. Pownall was engaged in the Imperial Air Training Plan in Canada during the first winter of this war, so he has many friends there.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rangoon, 16th: The Governor of Burma yesterday issued an order expanding the ban on imports of Japanese goods into Burma. Almost all kinds of goods are prohibited from entering. Anyone who wants to transport Japanese goods into the country must obtain a special permit.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Hu Shih Delivers Speech in the United States: China Is Determined to Fight to the End</h3>
<p>United Press, Orleans, 16th: Chinese Ambassador to Washington Dr. Hu Shih said yesterday while addressing Tulane University here that if China can obtain more supplies, it can achieve better results in the past fifty-two months. He said, "I can definitely guarantee that our people will fight to the end until we achieve the goals of national independence and freedom from aggression." Dr. Hu Shih said that there are five main facts that can enable China to maintain its normality, namely, exchanging time for space, China's extremely large population, China's unprecedented unity in history, domestic revival, and American aid.</p>
<h3>New York Holds First Air Raid Drill</h3>
<p>Havas, New York, 16th: New York City held its first air raid drill last night, with Mayor LaGuardia personally leading 150,000 civil defense personnel to participate, and using the French mail ship "Normandie" anchored in the port as a hypothetical attack target.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Evacuate Malaya</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 16th: A Japanese ship yesterday carried 450 Japanese residents of Malaya to Manila, including iron and tin miners, farmers, fishermen, merchants, and geishas. This ship will pick up some more Japanese residents in Manila and then return to Japan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Builds New Naval Base in California for Small Warships</h3>
<p>Havas, San Francisco, 16th: The U.S. government is building a new naval base in Morro Bay, California, for small warships, at a total cost of $500,000. Rear Admiral Greenslade, commander of the U.S. Navy's 12th Naval District, gave a speech at the port yesterday, stating that the U.S. Navy is strong enough to cope with a single attack by any naval power, but if the Axis powers act together and the United States is isolated and helpless, then the situation will be different. The United States Navy is not only superior to all countries in the world in terms of overall quantity, but also in terms of the combat power of each warship or sailor, it is the champion of the world.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Madrid, 16th: According to news from the Washington correspondent obtained here yesterday, the U.S. Navy Department has ordered 21 military airships from the Zeppelin Company in Ohio, six of which are already under construction. The Navy authorities intend to use these airships for patrolling in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Their officers and crew are being trained. The U.S. Navy currently has ten airships and 26 trained officers and 400 crew members. Six of them have joined the Navy, and the remaining four are for training purposes. Each of the new airships under construction has a crew of eight. Its new bases will be built in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, and Shearville, California, in the first half of next year.</p>
<h3>U.S. President Meets with Secretary of the Army to Discuss Taking Over Factories</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 16th: President Roosevelt met with Secretary of War Stimson and Seventh Army Corps Commander Lee for an hour yesterday. It is rumored that they discussed the Army's possible takeover of coal mines in the event of a strike.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th: United Mine Workers leader Lewis claimed last night after a three-hour meeting of labor and management representatives that the steel company coal mine dispute has not been resolved and that the deadline for a temporary no-strike agreement will expire at midnight. A total of 53,000 miners work in steel company coal mines. The union in Birmingham has issued a notice that if the Washington meeting fails, 8,000 miners there will begin a strike at midnight. In fact, the last important time is early Monday morning, because miners do not normally work on Sundays, so there is still a possibility that the two sides will continue to meet on Sunday to reach a final agreement.</p>
<h3>General de Gaulle Delivers Speech: Free French Charter Strives for Freedom and Equality</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: General de Gaulle, leader of the Free French Forces, spoke to 5,000 of his countrymen at Albert Hall yesterday, outlining the Free French Charter as follows: To wage war in every possible way; To allow the French people to freely express their thoughts and needs; When the war ends in the future, under the motto of freedom, equality, and fraternity, all French people will be able to work and think in freedom and glory. After reporting on the war situation, de Gaulle said that only free French people represent the true spirit of France, and that Germany will eventually feel that victory is impossible and Italy will feel that all hopes have been dashed.</p>
<h3>University of Athens Dissolved</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Athens, 16th: It was announced last night that the government has ordered the temporary dissolution of the University of Athens because the government's efforts to resolve the student unrest at the school have not been successful.</p>
<h3>Only One Crew Member Died on HMS Ark Royal</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: Official sources said yesterday that the British aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal sank off Gibraltar a few days ago after being torpedoed. Although the event was sudden, only one crew member died.</p>
<h3>Japanese Emperor Attends Special Diet, Orders Speedy Passage of Supplementary Budget; Delivers Brief Opening Address Without Mentioning Foreign Relations; Tojo and Shimada Report on Sino-Japanese War Situation Separately</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 16th: The Japanese Diet opened a special session today, with the Emperor ordering the Diet to pass a supplementary budget and other emergency bills to cope with the current situation. However, the Emperor did not mention the serious Japan-U.S. relations that are the main reason for convening the special session. The Emperor's speech was the shortest in history, disappointing observers who expected the Emperor to give special instructions to the Diet. Experts also hold the generally accepted view that this special session is the most important in Japanese history due to the unprecedented crisis, especially regarding the tense relations between the U.S. and Japan. The Emperor also did not mention Japan's close relations with its treaty allies and Japan's efforts to establish world peace. The Emperor wore a military uniform at the official opening of the Diet. Many foreign reporters and diplomats also wore morning dress to attend the opening ceremony. The Emperor's edict stated: "We order the Ministers of State to submit to the Diet a supplementary budget bill and other legislative bills necessary to cope with the current situation. You should do your best to handle these matters in accordance with Our will." Immediately after the opening ceremony, the Diet held a plenary session to pass a reply to the Emperor's edict. Then, Prime Minister and concurrently Army Minister Tojo and Navy Minister Shimada reported on the Sino-Japanese War situation.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Political circles in Japan are now looking forward to the extraordinary session of the Diet on Monday. The Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister will all deliver speeches. This extraordinary session is the first since the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. In the 51 years since the establishment of the Japanese Diet, extraordinary sessions have only been held 14 times. The Japanese newspapers unanimously believe that this meeting is more important than previous meetings. Although the Konoe Cabinet had planned to convene twice, both were cancelled. In view of the tense situation in the Pacific, the completion of the anti-Japanese front by the U.S., Britain, China, and the Netherlands, and in order to end the Sino-Japanese War, the Tojo Cabinet must inform the public of the policies adopted by Japan. It is reported that the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will announce the details of the Washington talks and Kurusu's mission to the U.S., as well as the determination to end the Sino-Japanese War and realize the new order in the Far East. The Finance Minister will announce a tax increase to increase revenue by 700 million yen.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th: Japan began a five-day temporary Diet session yesterday, which is said to be deciding on major plans for Japan's future. Prime Minister Tojo is expected to inform the Diet in detail of the plan decided by the cabinet today or tomorrow, and to allow it to vote on methods that can determine the issue of peace or war in the Pacific. Undoubtedly, the long-standing war of nerves has now reached its extreme, and a crisis is imminent. Many remarks in the past ten days have indicated how Washington is preparing to cope with the possibility of war in the Pacific, and British Prime Minister Churchill recently delivered a speech at London City Hall warning Japan. However, the Japanese government will respond to these remarks by conscripting reservists and greatly increasing military spending, so the situation in the Far East has deteriorated greatly. However, authoritative sources in London do not believe that Japan has burned its last ship, but if Japan must carry out its current policies, it will soon find itself in a position from which it cannot easily extricate itself. This kind of action will have extremely tragic consequences. The reaction in London official circles is still as stated by Churchill the other day: Britain does not want to fight in the Far East, but if it is forced to fight, Britain has no choice but to accept this situation gladly and resolutely.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Fifty-six members of the Kokumin Domei in the Japanese House of Representatives yesterday decided to support Imperial policy. This resolution will be submitted for discussion when the House of Representatives begins debate tomorrow. The resolution calls for the government to issue a statement opposing "America's intolerable attitude."</p>

<h3>If Japan Invades India and Burma, China Will Spare No Effort in Counter-Attacking: President Dai's Broadcast to India and Burma</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The China International Broadcasting Station broadcast a friendly program to India and Burma from 6:30 PM to 7:20 PM on the 15th. President Dai of the Examination Yuan personally came to the station to deliver an address and generously donated a complete set of Indian music records given to him by the poet Tagore during his visit to India last year. Additionally, Mr. Lin Donghai, a counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave a speech in English. The following is the text of President Dai's address:</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters of India and Burma, on this day of the Ox, I am representing the 450 million compatriots of China to visit our brothers and sisters of India and Burma. Today, I am also very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to you all through this broadcast. Although I left India and Burma almost a year ago, in this past year, the majestic and splendid Shwedagon Pagoda, the magnificent and extraordinary Buddhist sites of Bodh Gaya, Ajanta, and Ellora, and the countless kind and lovable men and women of India and Burma have constantly appeared before my eyes. The Shwedagon Pagoda and many holy sites in India are guarantees of selflessness, impartiality, and putting others before oneself. The people of India and Burma are models of diligence, thrift, hard work, and love of peace. I was honored to visit India and Burma last year and received a sincere welcome from all sectors of society. I am truly grateful for your friendship. However, I deeply know that your intention is to use me to convey the feelings of affection from your countries to the people of China. After returning to China, I fully conveyed the deep friendship of the two countries to my compatriots. The people of our country were greatly moved to hear of the sincere sympathy from our neighbors during the four years of difficult and arduous resistance against foreign invasion. India, Burma, and China have enjoyed a friendship of nearly a thousand years. The peoples of the three countries have loved peace since ancient times. Despite sharing thousands of miles of borders, there has never been any conflict or war. Those who traveled between us were either enlightened monks or scholars seeking knowledge, for the sake of Dharma and Tao, to save humanity, to spread learning, to enhance culture, and to promote peace. Therefore, our friendship of thousands of years has been maintained and has grown even closer. When I visited India and Burma last year, I informed the people of both countries about how Japan, our eastern neighbor, first broke the peace and caused a world war. I believe you still remember. In the past year, China's loyal and brave soldiers have united as one to resist the invaders. Japan has not gained an inch of progress. On the contrary, this autumn, we achieved a great victory in the battle of northern Hunan, and all the people of China feel that final victory is not far away. Today, Japan is at the end of its rope and wants to make a desperate gamble by advocating a southward advance. I and the people of China all believe that if Japan takes this action, its failure can be expected very soon. If Japan invades India and Burma, China will spare no effort in counter-attacking, so that Japan will not dare to move its troops from the Chinese mainland to attack India and Burma. China, India, and Burma have vast lands and abundant resources, accounting for one-third of the world's population. Defeating Japan will certainly not be difficult. In the past, our countries have communicated with each other, supported each other in times of distress. Now, with tyranny before us, the cooperation and mutual assistance of the three countries will be even more significant, in order to fulfill the historical mission of creating world peace that the peoples of China, India, and Burma have pursued for thousands of years. I take this opportunity to extend my greetings to my good friends in India and Burma, and wish both countries prosperity, the people happiness, and the friendship between India, Burma, and China to grow even closer.

<h3>Unifying National Tax Administration: National Tax Agency to Be Established; Ministry of Finance Currently Drafting Regulations for Handling National Taxes</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Ministry of Finance is currently drafting regulations to unify the national tax administration agencies to handle national taxes. This agency may be called the National Tax Agency in the future. China's current tax agencies are extremely diverse due to the evolution of circumstances. For example, the Customs Administration is in charge of customs duties, the Salt Administration Department and the Salt Affairs Bureau are in charge of salt taxes, and the Direct Tax Office is in charge of stamp tax, income tax, inheritance tax, and excess profit tax. In addition, there is also the Tax Administration, which is in charge of various commodity taxes, and the Taxation Department, which is in charge of land tax and other local taxes. Therefore, the procedures for investigating, collecting, and auditing various taxes are extremely complicated. After the new agency is established, it can centrally handle these matters.

<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Place Great Importance on the US Withdrawal of Marines, Believing That a US-Japan War Will Break Out Quickly, and That the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union Will Firmly Respond</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Official sources only stated that the US withdrawal of Marines in China is a precautionary measure by the US regarding the Pacific issue, and were unwilling to comment further. This morning, various newspapers stated that this move by the US proves the seriousness of the situation in the Pacific, with some even saying that war is inevitable. The Central Daily News titled its article "The Pacific Is No Longer Peaceful" and asserted that a US-Japan war is not only difficult to avoid but will also break out quickly. The newspaper stated that Japanese militarists have always been insatiable in their aggression. Now that the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union have recognized this point, they will surely respond firmly. The Ta Kung Pao stated that the overall situation in the Pacific is indeed tense, and Britain and the United States are preparing for war. What medicine is Kurusu carrying in his gourd will soon be revealed. Therefore, the trends in the overall situation in the Pacific will be apparent within the next three days. The Saodang Pao stated that the withdrawal of the Marines has demonstrated that the US is not only not avoiding war with Japan, but is also actively preparing for war against Japan.

Huang also said that when large-scale implementation is carried out in the future, land bonds must be issued to provide cash and avoid inflation. (16th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Review of Japan's Extraordinary Diet Session</h3>
<p>The 77th extraordinary session of the Japanese Diet, which opened on the 15th of this month, was convened at the suggestion of Prime Minister Tojo shortly after he took office. According to custom, the Japanese Diet convenes in mid-December each year. After opening, it is temporarily adjourned and resumes its proceedings in January of the following year. Now, with only one month separating this from the customary convocation date, Tojo hastily convened an extraordinary session. At a time when the United States had just revised its Neutrality Act and Kurusu had gone to the United States for final negotiations, this action naturally attracted the attention of all parties in the world. Some even prepared to judge the direction of Japanese policy based on the results of this Diet session.</p>
<p>Reviewing the history of the Japanese Diet over the past fifty years, it cannot be denied that it has played a significant role in Japanese politics, especially in the decade or so after World War I, which was its golden age. However, according to the provisions of the Japanese Constitution, the main powers of the Japanese Diet are only the right to cooperate in legislation and the right to cooperate in the budget. In addition, the levying and increasing of taxes must also be approved by the Diet. This is very different from the legislative bodies of other democratic countries in the world, which possess supreme power. The determination of national policies and the personnel of government agencies do not necessarily have to be subject to the constraints of the Diet. After the May 15th Incident, the Japanese political situation completely deviated from constitutional norms, and successive cabinets were established as "extraordinary" in nature. Their relationship with the Diet became increasingly distant. In particular, when Konoe advocated the "New Political System Movement" last year, he prepared to reform the Diet, limiting its function to "supporting the throne." For a time, the Diet members were as silent as cicadas, and the political parties dissolved one after another. Although this resulted in no achievements, it made the Diet, which was already like a fattened sheep, even more lifeless. To this day, if one says that the Japanese government must wait for the Diet's approval before deciding on domestic and foreign policies, everyone knows that this is not the case. Thus, the so-called preparation by Tojo to have the Diet vote on the issue of war and peace in the Pacific is clearly nothing more than comparing Japan's "extraordinary" politics to the usual practices of Western democratic countries, and is of no use. The convocation of the extraordinary session of the Diet is undoubtedly of great significance, but it is only to obtain broad national support after the Japanese government has decided on its policies, rather than deciding its advance or retreat based on the Diet's approval or disapproval—even if it were to do so, it would only be a matter of form, and the real decision-making power is not in the Diet. This is because, first, the Japanese Diet still holds the major powers conferred by the Constitution—passing laws and budgets, and approving increases in taxes; second, between the Japanese government and the people, the Diet is still an important intermediary, and cannot be replaced by organizations such as the "Central Cooperative Council for Supporting the Throne." Before the Japanese Diet system has been fundamentally changed, no matter how powerful the government is, it still cannot do without the Diet's assistance on such issues. This is probably the main reason why Tojo convened the extraordinary session of the Diet. The policy statement that Tojo is preparing to issue today can be valued, but what is more noteworthy is his proposal to establish a wartime system, the additional supplementary budget of 3.8 billion yuan for military expenses, the new tax plan of 600 million to 700 million yuan, and even the "additional budget proposal to prepare for the adaptation of the new domestic system." In short, all of these are to accelerate the completion of "wartime preparedness," which the Japanese government regards as the most central task. The Japanese people's views on this are not fully known, but judging from the situation shown by the Japanese Diet in recent years, it is clear that there is no expectation of major support. Even if views like those of Saito Takao have not disappeared, probably no one would dare to bravely repeat his mistakes.</p>
<p>As for Japan's future direction, rather than waiting for the results of the extraordinary session of the Diet, it is better to examine the current international situation and the various measures taken by the Japanese government to gain a clearer understanding. Between these two situations, there is currently a contradiction: the latter is determined to expand and move towards the path of war preparations. Especially since the establishment of the Tojo Cabinet, on the one hand, political affairs and strategy have been integrated, and on the other hand, strict internal control has also been completed. This, combined with its already implemented "national mobilization" and "construction of a highly national defense system," has made its desire to expand by means of war almost uncontrollable. However, on the other hand, in the current international situation, Japan is facing an unprecedentedly difficult juncture. It has become impossible to extricate itself from the stalemated Sino-Japanese war, and the intensified cooperation of the ABCD line, the declaration of the final determination of Britain and the United States, and the completion of preparations for contingency measures in the Far East have made Japan face the dilemma of being immediately surrounded on all sides throughout the Pacific if it acts recklessly. Whether it advances south, north, or west, there are considerable difficulties. Its ally, Nazi Germany, even if it can dominate the European continent, has almost zero strength outside of Europe, and its piracy at sea and its strategy against the Soviet Union are far from sufficient to support Japan. The subjective situation of Japan is like this, and the shape of the international situation is like that. As long as rational control is not lost, it must be clear that this is definitely not the time to act recklessly. Because of the existence of this contradictory situation, despite being surrounded by extreme elements and war enthusiasts, and despite the declaration of the firm stance of Britain and the United States, the Tojo Cabinet still wants to send Kurusu to travel across the ocean to make a final mediation, although it is unlikely to put forward a plan acceptable to democratic countries. Therefore, in this session of the Diet, the attitude that Tojo may declare is likely to be a flexible policy rich in opportunism, but it will not relax the "wartime" deployment and preparation, and at a minimum, it should be based on "resolving the China Incident." This situation, even if it appears moderate on the surface, cannot conceal its inherent explosive danger, which is what all relevant parties should be extremely vigilant about.</p>
<h3>Moscow Radio Announces Soviet Victory on All Fronts; Germans Build Forts to Prepare for Winter</h3>
<p>Reuters, 16th, London - Moscow Radio announced that Soviet troops had won repeated victories on the front line from the Arctic Ocean to the south. The German attempt to reach the fishermen's peninsula in the Arctic Ocean failed. Twenty Axis ships were sunk. Enemy artillery positions in the Karelian front were destroyed one by one by Soviet artillery. The enemy repeatedly tried to attack but failed. Soviet aircraft attacked at low altitude on the Leningrad front, destroying German truck convoys carrying military supplies. German losses are increasing along the road to Tula (110 miles south of Moscow). The German plan for a frontal attack has failed, and their attempt to flank the Soviet army has also been ineffective. According to news from the southern front received by Moscow, the Caucasian troops in the Don region have been annihilating the invading enemy soldiers every day for the past 35 days. A fierce battle took place in the area of Soyavka. The Germans initially gained the advantage, but the Caucasian cavalry counterattacked, fighting against overwhelming odds, driving the Germans into the river. The Germans later attacked again, and Soyavka changed hands five times, but the Germans eventually died or drowned in the river. It is reported that the Germans lost a total of five regiments. The German military reporter on the radio last night said that the German troops on the eastern front were progressing slowly due to abnormal weather. Heavy rain and muddy roads, and strong winds. Such wind and rain are unusual before mid-January, so the army is moving more slowly than in the summer, but the final victory depends on the morale of the German army. The latest Soviet communiqué stated that there were battles on all fronts yesterday. On November 14, 44 German aircraft were shot down, and the Soviet air force also lost 10 aircraft. On November 15, 4 German aircraft were shot down near Moscow.</p>
<p>Reuters, 16th, London - According to the latest news received here, although the Nazis continue to attack fiercely, the Soviet army has taken the initiative in many areas. The Germans are now building forts and machine gun positions along the entire 1,200-mile front line, apparently preparing to defend the front line during the winter.</p>
<p>TASS, 16th, Geneva - The German losses on the eastern front are so heavy that every German family has felt it. Therefore, German newspapers can no longer conceal it. Recently, the Berlin Stock Exchange openly admitted that every person in Germany currently has relatives who have died on the front line, but asked the public to understand the difficulties and prepare for even greater sacrifices.</p>
<h3>US Lend-Lease Administrator Harriman Flies to London to Adjust Aid to Britain and the Soviet Union; US Merchant Ships Are Being Fitted with Guns</h3>
<p>Reuters, 16th, New York - Lend-Lease administrator Harriman flew to London yesterday to continue handling the adjustment of aid to Britain and the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease Act. He told reporters that the UK and the US have a large number of supplies being transported to the Soviet Union. He has ample evidence to prove that the Soviet Union is currently making good use of these supplies. Five Republican members of the House of Representatives also flew to England on the same plane to stay in England for 18 days, to study the UK's war effort and the effectiveness of Lend-Lease aid, as well as the UK's solutions to civil defense and labor issues.</p>
<p>Havas, 15th, Egyptian Capital - A US automobile delegation, led by General Bierer, will soon arrive in the Iranian capital to inspect the situation of US aircraft, weapons, and other goods being transported to the Soviet Union via the Iranian port of Basra.</p>
<p>Reuters, 16th, Washington - Although the Neutrality Act Amendment will not take effect until Monday, according to sources responsible here, some US merchant ships are currently being fitted with guns, and sailors in various ports are currently being assigned to load supplies directly to Britain in the middle of next week. The Navy Department will certainly not announce its plan to protect US merchant ships, but there are signs that warships are escorting the ships. According to news from New York, the Maritime Commission currently plans to send three more merchant ships across the Atlantic to Britain each week. New freighters will continue to be launched, about three each week. These new freighters are all equipped with gun mounts and some secret self-defense features. Naval sources claim that merchant ships currently at sea will also be armed upon their return. It is estimated that 300 of the 1,200 US merchant ships will be equipped with three-inch and five-inch guns.</p>
<p>United Press, 16th, Washington - US ships and aircraft escorting armed merchant ships across the Atlantic can use British bases, so that a huge amount of US war supplies can be transported to Britain. Officials declined to comment on this report, but authoritative sources said, "This is a reasonable guess" because this new route sailed by American ships should receive complete protection. Because the Neutrality Act Amendment was passed by Congress last week, merchant ships can sail into combat zones and combat ports, and the US Atlantic Fleet can use this new base to protect merchant ships.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 16th, Madrid - According to news from New York, the US Navy Department has drafted a four-month plan to arm American merchant ships. A total of 400 ships will begin to be armed, and 100 ships can leave the arsenal each week. All the cannons currently available are sufficient to equip 400 ships. There is a type of five-inch cannon that also serves as an anti-aircraft gun and an anti-submarine gun. Gunmen are supplied by the Navy Department. Depending on the size of the ship, each ship will be assigned 10 to 16 gunmen. The bill to amend the Neutrality Act will likely be signed by President Roosevelt tomorrow, so that the arming of merchant ships can begin immediately. It is estimated that about 1,600 merchant ships will be armed. According to well-informed sources, due to the lack of raw materials, it will take a long time to complete the armament of the remaining 1,200 ships, in addition to the 400 ships.</p>
<p>European War Talk</p>
<h3>The Female Calamity in French Politics</h3>
<p>She also wanted to find someone to use as a stepping stone for her own advancement. Daladier seemed to please her more than others, yet she didn't realize he was all surface. The famous novelist Daudet once said: "This wild bull only has the antennae of a snail." Daladier was burly and somewhat crude, a friend of boisterous gatherings. He was newly widowed with two young children, immersed in grief. Little did he expect that the son of a baker from a small southern town would capture the favor of a Marchioness. No wonder he was flattered.</p>
<p>He saw this woman caring for his health, commenting on his attire, and worrying about his future. He felt grateful and reciprocated with sincerity. Unknowingly, she had awakened an ambition he had never dared to admit.</p>
<p>These women all indulged in pleasure. Madame Gihou Mureau, a glamorous widow of an art dealer, conspired with Sarraut. Théodore, on the other hand, worked in the dressing room of the famous actress Marguerite at the Comédie-Française. On his desk was a photograph of Théodore with the inscription: "To my little pawn, respectfully presented by her protector." From this alone, one could see the depth of their affection.</p>
<p>At Mademoiselle Faur's house, we could also hear Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Reury using his poetic talent and tone to expound his opinions on foreign policy. The gathering place for the Radical Party was at Madame Sireyta's house, brimming with the freshness of spring. Madame Sireyta relied on her endless stream of friends to navigate between the socialist and centralist factions.</p>
<p>In Countess de Montgomery's white silk-decorated living room, we could meet the cream of the crop, including newspaper tycoons, cabinet ministers, and ambassadors from various countries.</p>
<p>The husband of Duchess d'Harcourt was a member of parliament, but she advocated for closer ties with Germany. She often expressed her views to influential members of parliament like Abetz and Hencke during social gatherings. Abetz was formerly an art professor in Karlsruhe, initially unknown, but later became a confidant of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. He was expelled from France in August 1939 for espionage, but now he has returned to Paris as the German ambassador to France. Hencke was a well-known correspondent for the German Frankfurter Zeitung. In 1927, a Parisian woman even committed suicide for him. Before the German invasion of France, he was the leader of a German spy ring stationed in Belgium and Brussels.</p>
<p>Even the most dignified men could not resist the temptation of women. Montel, known for his sharp voice, high collar, and black stockings, and considered to have a cold demeanor, was completely smitten by Madame Maginot, with her fair skin and complexion, and willingly submitted to her charms.</p>
<p>Another French actress, the dark-haired beauty, Arbell, encouraged the foreign minister of the Popular Front government, Delbos.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Chautemps, though known for his prudence, was manipulated at will by the slender fingers of the famous pianist Madame Durand-Texte. Despite having many children and grandchildren, he was so infatuated with beauty that he did not hesitate to divorce his wife, also breaking up a marriage so his dream lover could marry a clerk in his law firm.</p>
<p>The Freemasons, a French secret society, had great faith in Chautemps but, upon witnessing his scandalous behavior, severed ties with him. He did not care. On May 16th, as German troops advanced victoriously, Chautemps still addressed the French press, saying, "Gentlemen, I have good news for you! I am still capable. My new wife has just given birth to a child."</p>
<p>Let's not forget Pongue, the French permanent representative to the League of Nations, and the protector of Mademoiselle Ventura of the Comédie-Française. He once wrote a letter from Geneva to Madame Fontanges, saying, "When I think of your lovely jade body, I no longer curse the chaos in Central Europe." Fontanges was once a mistress of Mussolini, and the French ambassador to Italy, Chambrun, was reprimanded for interfering with Mussolini and her affair.</p>
<p>French politics was manipulated by beautiful women. All political changes were the result of their ambition and conspiracies. Amid internal and external troubles, they remained in a state of drunken stupor! The voices of revolution were heard everywhere. With the war looming, the panic of 1938 arrived, and Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany, leading to the Munich Conference.</p>
<p>Hélène de Portes supported the Munich Agreement, while Reynaud strongly opposed it.</p>
<p>Back in 1934, Hélène, occasionally ill, went to Vienna for treatment. There she became acquainted with many leaders of the National Socialist parties in Germany and Austria. To this day, some accuse her of being bought by Hitler's men, using her and her relationship with Reynaud, and claiming Hélène received several rewards for their efforts. In reality, she had personal savings, and her wealth increased under Reynaud's guidance, so we dare not believe this accusation. However, her fascination with power and love of scheming are undeniable.</p>
<p>At one point, she was a political agent for the Habsburgs, but later turned against them. She even went to Belgium to visit the Duke of Guise, who was in exile and claimed to be the heir to the French throne. Although Reynaud was a staunch republican, she must have assured the Duke that Reynaud would work for him. Her dream was to make Reynaud infatuated with her and be her puppet in political conspiracies. Reynaud refused to hinder the Popular Front experiment, and even said he wanted to form a mixed cabinet, incorporating all parties from communist to far-right. However, the more Reynaud leaned left, the more Hélène leaned right.</p>
<p>After the Munich Conference, salon socializing became commonplace, and talk of a Franco-German agreement was prevalent. The leading women of Parisian society used pacifism, realism, and anti-communism as their mantra, using beauty as bait to influence political figures.</p>
<p>Using the pretext of holding a hunting exhibition in Berlin, Göring invited influential Parisian ladies, such as Montgomery, Hélène de Portes, d'Harcourt, and the Marquise de Crussol, to his magnificent home for cordial entertainment. As a result, when they returned to their country, their minds were filled with images of extreme luxury and sweet words. They had been swayed by the Nazis, and upon returning home, they sought to sway their friends.</p>
<p>However, Reynaud refused to agree. He declared that France had entered a bloodless period of war. He sharply criticized the French middle class, saying their political ideas were stolen from abroad. "People used to plagiarize French ideas. Now the middle class is digging its own grave, just like the aristocracy before the revolution. However, the aristocracy of the past died with a smile, while today's middle class is holding its own funeral rope."</p>
<p>That's how it was in the summer of 1939. Daladier lacked decisiveness, and the Marquise de Crussol's advice only made him more indecisive. He didn't declare war until the last second.</p>
<p>The inevitable finally arrived.</p>
<p>Hélène knew her time had come. She had to act swiftly. In fact, France had already turned to Reynaud, who would become the Clemenceau of the Second World War. Seeing Reynaud's growing popularity, the Marchioness continued to inform Daladier of all Reynaud's plans. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Several Hundred Types of Food and Medicine: Retail Price Limits Announced; Import Association Submits for Approval by Authorities, to Be Implemented Tomorrow; Others to Be Announced Gradually; Equalization Board Orders Foreign Banks to Strictly Manage Export Exchange</h3>
<p>According to authoritative banking sources, the Equalization Fund Committee has made comprehensive decisions on the issues of commodity prices and exchange rates in Shanghai. In implementation, it will continue to use a broader allocation method to supply foreign exchange for the import of essential goods and other secondary items. At the same time, it has ordered various friendly foreign banks to strictly manage the purchase of export exchange. With this two-pronged approach, not only can the illegal exchange market be eliminated, but the prices set by the Equalization Board – US$5.34375 and 3 pence 1/875 per pound – can be universally applied. The purchasing power of legal tender can be sustainably stabilized, and the abnormal price increases currently encountered can be completely eliminated. Moreover, the Municipal Council, in cooperation with the Equalization Board, will take the initiative to attack merchants who speculate and profit.</p>
<p>Suppliers Must Provide As Much As Possible</p>
<p>According to a public notice issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Qingbao Department, the local Import Association has submitted the first batch of retail prices, totaling more than 300 items, all of which are goods sold by foreign food companies and pharmacies. They have been approved by the two concession Municipal Councils as the maximum retail prices and have been announced in the Western newspapers of this (17th) day for reference by retail merchants and users. Because there are so many of these goods, and they are imported, translation takes time, so the Chinese newspapers will not be able to publish them simultaneously. Retail merchants who sell the above items must sell them at the limited prices from the 18th of this month and must not exceed them. They should also supply customers to the extent of their normal needs as much as possible. (See Public Notice No. 5596 in today's Western newspapers for detailed prices.) Subsequent price lists will be published gradually as they are obtained.</p>
<p>Flour Merchants Plan to Smuggle Goods Out of the Country</p>
<p>Since the authorities in this city controlled prices, flour hoarders have used various methods in the past few days to secretly move thousands of bags of flour out of the concession in an attempt to transport them to North China to obtain better prices. This has now been discovered and stopped by the Municipal Council. It is reported that the flour merchants planned to transport over one million bags of flour out of the concession. The sudden order issued by the Municipal Council to prohibit movement was unexpected by the flour merchants. It is reported that dozens of cargo ships, fully loaded with flour, attempted to leave the concession a few days ago, but were all stopped by the Municipal Council. The owners gathered at the Municipal Council's Price Control Office, requesting permission to release the goods, but were all rejected and expelled by Mr. Patterson. According to Mr. Patterson, shipments of flour must be inspected by the Municipal Council before they can be approved. If there is a legitimate reason for transporting flour, it will be approved. It is reported that after the Municipal Council's economic strategy, flour prices have plummeted, and flour hoarders have suffered significant losses. Mr. Patterson also hopes for assistance from the public and the press.</p>
<p>Coal Catty Exchange Rate Needs Reduced Again</p>
<p>Local legitimate coal merchants purchasing Yanbaimei coal catties can now obtain huge amounts of foreign exchange. In the future, coal catties shipped to Shanghai will increase even more, and coal catty hoarders are not without fear, eagerly seeking to lower the price of domestic goods and release them onto the market. In recent days, the spot market for coal has shown an oversupply, but people are tired and unwilling to hoard at high prices, so the outlet for spot goods is quite sluggish. The entire coal market is currently showing a slump. According to news from various coal industry associations, the sales prices of Yanbaimei coal catties, regardless of high or low quality, have fallen by 100 to 200 yuan per ton compared to half a month ago. If they are released at the current market price, coal merchants holding goods can still obtain very generous profits. The stockpiles of various coal yards in this city (including Pudong, Hongkou, Huxi, and the French Concession) are still extremely full. According to estimates by those familiar with the coal market, the current coal stockpile has increased to about 480,000 tons. Including the coal catties purchased by various user factories, the total coal stockpile in the city should be over 500,000 tons. Recently, due to the sharp increase in coal prices, various users have reduced their consumption, so the monthly coal demand has decreased. During this time of oversupply and sluggish sales, coal yard stockpiles will become even more full.</p>
<p>150,000 Tons Transacted Recently</p>
<p>According to news from major coal companies, in recent days, various coal merchants have been proactively increasing their coal yard stockpiles in preparation for unforeseen circumstances. They have been sending telegrams to various coal-producing areas overseas to continue ordering large quantities of Yanbaimei coal catties. It is reported that in the last ten days, over 150,000 tons of coal catties have been ordered, with a production price of only US$2.3 per ton. Although the transportation cost exceeds the production price, there is still a considerable profit. The spot goods currently traded in the market are mostly those that were shipped earlier, and the profit per ton is even greater.</p>
<p>The End of Speculative Rice Hoarding Has Arrived</p>
<p>Regarding which goods are the important items for the second step of control, Municipal Council officials refused to disclose, saying that this is the only way to prevent hoarders from grasping the situation. It is reported that the trend of hoarding and raising prices for some goods has not stopped slightly, but it is only a matter of time. It is reported that the Municipal Council's Price Control Office has created a form listing the rice stockpiles of various rice stores for verification. From now on, the major problem of rice hoarding and monopoly can be curbed. Since the Municipal Council stipulated rice prices, rice hoarders have suffered losses of over 60 million yuan. In the past few weeks, Municipal Council officials have been quite successful in managing prices.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Invites Bids for 500 Tons of Edible Oil</h3>

<h3>Survey of the City for the Required Amount of Soybeans</h3>
<p>The Tofu Industry Association reports that the price of soybeans used to make tofu has risen to about 110 yuan per 100 market catties due to general speculative hoarding, which is 30% higher than the current price of rice (rice is 130 yuan per 160 market catties, while soybeans are 110 yuan per 100 market catties). Other items such as fuel, salt brine, and gypsum have also doubled compared to last month. The members of the association feel it is difficult to maintain operations and have written to the association requesting relief. Furthermore, some members in Hongkou and Nanshi temporarily closed down for several days due to losses. They have since resumed operations after being persuaded by the association. According to a Datsung News Agency reporter, the association has submitted a request to the authorities in the two concessions to lower the price of soybeans. They have now drafted a form and will send staff to various shops starting tomorrow to survey the daily soybean requirements in order to provide thorough relief.</p>
<h3>Merchant Corps to Take Over U.S. Defense Zone; British and Americans Agree; No Confirmation Yet on Arrival Date of Troop Withdrawal Ship</h3>
<p>The 4th U.S. Marine Regiment in Shanghai, with a long history of 14 years, received orders to withdraw from Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, stationed in Manila. They have been preparing to withdraw in the shortest possible time. According to well-informed sources, Colonel Howard, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai, sent a letter to the Japanese naval and military authorities yesterday to notify them of the withdrawal. However, this information could not be confirmed by the U.S. Marine Corps as of last night. However, U.S. consular authorities revealed yesterday that Washington had not issued any new instructions to evacuate Americans from Shanghai.</p>
<p>No Confirmation Yet on Troop Withdrawal Ship</p>
<p>As for the ships withdrawing the U.S. defense forces, one source says it is the U.S. President liner McKinley, which has remained stationed in Manila and has not left the Far East coast. The McKinley is one of the newest giant ships built by the U.S. Shipping Administration and is considered a sister ship to the President Coolidge. It was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai on its maiden voyage. The ship is currently docked in Hong Kong and will set sail for Shanghai soon. Another source says the ship taking over the U.S. defense forces will be the U.S. transport ship Henderson, which has already come to Shanghai from the Pacific. Yet another source says that the President Taft has been dispatched to take over from Manila and that the first group will leave Shanghai within three days escorted by a U.S. destroyer. However, as this concerns military matters, the headquarters of the 4th U.S. Marine Regiment is unwilling to comment. It is said that the 750 U.S. troops in Shanghai and the 165 U.S. troops in Peiping have decided to complete the withdrawal within two weeks.</p>
<p>Merchant Corps to Take Over Defense Zone; British and Americans Agree</p>
<p>Colonel Howard, Commander of the U.S. forces in Shanghai, will be the last to leave Shanghai. After the U.S. troops withdraw, what will happen to the defense zone west of Yu Chaching Road and south of Suzhou Creek in the International Settlement? This has been a major concern for all parties. According to sources, the Municipal Council has already received the approval of the British and Americans. They plan to follow the precedent set during the British troop withdrawal last August and hand over the defense to the Municipal Council's International Merchant Corps, as the area is of great importance to British and American interests. As for the troop withdrawal issue, the U.S. consular office in Shanghai remained silent yesterday. However, some believe that although this move by the United States is not preparing for war with Japan, the fact that U.S. merchant ships will be armed and enter the territorial waters of belligerent countries means that the United States has abandoned neutrality. The withdrawal of U.S. troops in China already implies the attitude that the United States will adopt towards the situation in the Far East in the future.</p>
<p>U.S. Troops in North China Reportedly Coming to Shanghai</p>
<p>The 55-man U.S. Embassy guard in Peiping and the 165-man defense force in Tianjin have been ordered to withdraw and will be concentrated in Shanghai by special ship before being jointly withdrawn. The first group to be withdrawn will be 300 men, and the ships ordered to come to Shanghai are of great tonnage and sufficient to accommodate them. As for the Americans remaining in Shanghai, there have been no new orders for another evacuation. In other words, the original evacuation order remains in effect. The British Consulate in Shanghai hopes that non-essential women and children without special reasons for staying in Shanghai will evacuate immediately.</p>
<p>U.S. Military Camp Site Advertised for Sale</p>
<p>Asia Real Estate Company is currently running advertisements in newspapers regarding the sale of the headquarters and barracks of the U.S. defense forces in the New Road Xiaoshadu Road area. This is because the U.S. defense forces no longer need to use them after their withdrawal. According to the advertisement, those who wish to rent them can contact the real estate company at 934 Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<h3>The Saint Nabertin Arrives in Port Carrying Coal and 2,500 Tons of Cement</h3>
<p>The Saint Nabertin, a French Postal Company liner, arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong yesterday morning and docked at No. 14 and 15 pontoons on the Huangpu River. The ship carries 2,000 tons of coal and 2,500 tons of cement, which will be unloaded in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Lunch Boxes from the Concession Prohibited from Being Transported to Nanshi</h3>
<p>Since the authorities in the two concessions suppressed the price of rice within the concession, these foreign rice are completely supplied by the Shanghai Municipal Council, so it is prohibited to transport it to non-concession areas such as Huxi and Nanshi. All lunch box businesses in the two concessions that contract lunch boxes in Nanshi and Huxi are prohibited from delivering from yesterday onwards. Yesterday evening, a Datsung News Agency reporter toured various check points and saw dozens of lunch boxes waiting to be transported at each location, but they were still unable to be sent in. They completely dispersed around 9 p.m. — Wang Jingrong</p>
<h3>Installation of Fluorescent Lamps and the Electricity Company's Management Regulations</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingrong</p>
<p>According to the table above, if a 60-cycle lamp is used on a 50-cycle current, the light emitted is 10% more than a 50-cycle lamp, but the power consumption is 30% more, and the lifespan is reduced to less than half of a 50-cycle lamp. Comparing the two, the advantages and disadvantages are immediately apparent. Users must pay attention for their own benefit.</p>
<p>Power Factor</p>
<p>Fluorescent lamps have a characteristic that the actual amount of electricity consumed is only 60% of the amount of electricity transmitted by the generator. In other words, if the generator outputs 100 units of current from the power line for a certain fluorescent lamp, only 60 of them produce useful work, and the remaining 40 return along the original path. Therefore, the power factor of ordinary tungsten filament lamps is 100%, while the power factor of fluorescent lamps is only 60%, because 40% of the current is not effective, but the transmission cost does not decrease (the capacity of the electricity bill is still 100%). Therefore, fluorescent lamps are low power factor electrical appliances. According to the regulations of the Shanghai Power Company, it is necessary to install power factor adjustment equipment.</p>
<p>Correction Principle</p>
<p>Since the advent of fluorescent lamps, there have been many inquiries about what power factor is and why it is necessary to correct the power factor. It is not easy for non-electrical engineers to understand this issue. Here, let's try to use an analogy to explain it.</p>
<p>Now, taking the transaction of carpets as an example, someone, Mr. A, goes to a carpet store and asks to have two carpets sent to his home. The store hires two rickshaws to deliver them. As a result, Mr. A only buys one of them, and orders the deliveryman to bring the other one back. The store pays for the round-trip fare for one more carpet, and must do extra bookkeeping work, resulting in a loss. If Mr. A often does this, the store will definitely not welcome his patronage if it does not directly or indirectly recover the cost of this service from him, because this kind of transaction is very unfair.

<h3>Oil Tanker "Wu Jiang" Detained; Oil Unloaded Ashore</h3>
<p>Since July 22nd, the Japanese side has detained the oil tanker "Wu Jiang," owned by British Asia Petroleum Company, and its 12 Chinese crew members. They are still under detention. It has been impossible to obtain information about this matter from the Japanese authorities, but it is said that the Japanese side will make an announcement about this soon. The "Wu Jiang" was detained by the Japanese side with a U.S. ship in July, when they were transporting oil along the Yangtze River Estuary. The U.S. ship was released immediately, but the "Wu Jiang" was detained in front of the Japanese wharf in Yangshupu Ham and unloaded the oil. The crew members were also detained. The Japanese side did not provide food, so the ship owner had to provide the 12 crew members with necessities. The British authorities have protested several times because of this. However, the Japanese side replied that the ship "had no right to sail in the Yangtze River Estuary."</p>

<h3>20,000 Bags of Stored Foreign Rice to Be Released Today; Daily Sales Price: $130 Per Stone; Transport Permits Must Be Returned to the Association Immediately After Use</h3>
<p>Two days ago, the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association used a lottery method to first designate 20,000 bags of foreign rice stored by thirteen fellow merchants to be handed over to the Rice Management Committee for distribution to rice shops lacking rice within the Public Concession. The rice shops designated by the association have now started claiming the foreign rice from the warehouses. All rice distribution commenced at 10:20 AM today. The payment location is at Wanfeng Rice Shop, No. 1 Tianzhutang Street. The price is $160 per bag (224 pounds) and the retail price at the door is $130 per stone (160 market catties net weight), regardless of the type of foreign rice, whether it's Saigon Small Grain, Haiphong, or Siam.</p>
<p>The price is uniform.</p>
<p>After the rice distribution is completed, it must be sold at the door of each rice shop at the specified price. The Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association yesterday specially sent representatives to contact the Rice Management Committee to collect and issue transport permits. To ensure utmost caution, the association formulated the following transport usage regulations at 4 PM that afternoon: All industry members who need to obtain a permit for transporting rice must return the permit to the association daily after use, without delay. This rice transport permit can only be used to transport rice and grain registered with the association and approved by the Municipal Council. The amount transported must not exceed the approved quantity. This permit is only</p>
<p>valid for one use.</p>
<p>It must not be lent to others for private use. If any of the above regulations are violated, once discovered, the shop will be strictly investigated. At that time, the association will specially send two responsible personnel to issue the permits. When paying for the rice, all rice shop personnel must present their market entry permit and shop seal, and then apply for the transport permit with the delivery order and entry permit. Yesterday, the Rice Shop Trade Association registered a total of 119 households, accounting for 7,720 bags of rice and grain. The association is still processing registrations today.</p>
<h3>The Case of Xu Songyao's Tragic Death to Be Investigated Tomorrow; All Involved Will Be Tried Together; Xu Xiangsun Sent to Sanatorium Due to Illness</h3>
<p>The tragic deaths of Xu Songyao, the young owner of Huamei Pharmacy, and his chauffeur, Zheng Aqing, have seen significant progress in the investigation since the French police department had the two coffins brought to the Tulas Road mortuary for re-examination and thorough investigation. The truth has largely come to light. In addition to the principal offender, Xu Daquan, who is naturally detained, the case has also implicated French Concession police detectives Lu Zanyuan and Xu Kaitao, the photographer Lao Guangdong, and a clerk from the Tongren Fuyuan Hall named Miao, all of whom have been detained for investigation. Xu's father, Xiangsun, also surrendered to the police station last week. Due to suffering from severe hemoptysis, the police station approved his transfer to Wang Qizhang Sanatorium for treatment, and specially assigned detectives to guard him in shifts. As for the Xu Jihua and Xihua sisters, they have been released on bail by the police station. It is now known that the French police department has scheduled a public investigation of the case for tomorrow (the 18th). At that time, all the involved parties, including Xu Xiangsun, will be tried together, and numerous subpoenas will be issued, ordering relevant witnesses to appear in court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Second Day of Tuberculosis Prevention Publicity: Posting of Warning Slogans</h3>
<p>To eradicate tuberculosis, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association launched an expanded publicity and fundraising campaign the day before yesterday. In addition to hanging slogans on various roads, yesterday they also posted flyers on the display windows of major companies and shops, including: Do you know that Shanghai Tuberculosis Hospitals are overcrowded everywhere, with as many as five people per bed? Do you know that a tuberculosis patient can cough up 7 million tubercle bacilli in one sputum? Do you know that the tubercle bacilli in dried sputum can survive for seven or eight months? Do you know that if tuberculosis patients are not sent to isolation for treatment, every family will be at risk of being infected? Do you know that the best way to eradicate tuberculosis throughout the city is to donate to build anti-tuberculosis hospitals? The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association is raising one million yuan to build a large-scale anti-tuberculosis hospital so that patients can be isolated and treated, and those who are not sick can avoid infection. Our fates are intertwined, so please donate generously. The wording is extremely alarming.</p>
<h3>Time Bomb Explodes, One Dead; Xianyue Dance Palace Bombed; Most Threw Grenades</h3>
<p>At 11:25 PM last night, a large time bomb suddenly exploded under a table at the Xianyue Dance Palace on Jing'an Temple Road. At the time, a dancer named Wang Zuying, 26 years old, from Shanghai, living at No. 2 Fuxu Lane, Fuxu Road, was passing by while dancing. His head was hit by the explosion, his skull shattered, and he fell to the ground, bleeding brain matter. Shrapnel also injured one male and one female dancer each.

Both suffered head and facial injuries. When reporters went to investigate, they saw a pool of blood and brain matter in the pool, and many fragments of shattered glass. Wang Zuying died soon after without treatment because of the critical nature of his injuries. About half an hour before the bombing, several dancers had a conflict with a foreigner. As a result, a Zhang Juncai had his face and mouth injured, and two of his front teeth were knocked out. He was also taken to Binjiang Hospital by ambulance. The police are investigating the cause of the bombing.</p>
<p>At about 10 PM last night, someone suddenly threw a smoke grenade into the dance floor of the Metropolitan Dance Hall on Gordon Road. The hall was filled with light and dense smoke. The police were alerted and sent detectives to investigate. The person who threw the grenade had already fled.</p>

<h3>Yunnan Provincial Education Funds Will Be Disbursed Uniformly by the Central Government; To Be Incorporated into the New Revenue and Expenditure System Next Year</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) The educational funds of this province have always been based on the cigarette tax and a portion of the rental income from educational official properties, with the majority relying on the cigarette tax. Since the formal division of national and local revenue and expenditure last July, the cigarette tax has been assigned to national tax and is received by the Yunnan Regional Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The central government subsidizes 350,000 yuan per month for education funds, but the income from educational official properties is limited, resulting in a significant monthly shortfall. The Fudian New Bank has provided some bridging loans, but the fundamental problem has not been resolved. The National Financial Conference this year resolved to reform the national financial revenue and expenditure system, changing the three-tier system of county-province-national to a two-tier system of county-national. The provincial budget is incorporated into the national budget, and the provincial government has ordered all agencies to prepare their budgets for the next year and submit them to the central government for approval and uniform disbursement. After receiving the order, the Education Department has prepared a budget for education expenses for the next year and submitted it to the provincial government for forwarding to the central government for approval and disbursement, as well as submitting it to the Ministry of Education for approval. According to discussions with relevant parties in the Education Department, the problem of educational funds in this province can be completely resolved after uniform disbursement by the central government according to the new budget.</p>
<h3>Schools in Shaoxing Have Moved and Resumed Classes</h3>
<p>To promote wartime education, the Shaoxing County Government in Zhejiang Province has relocated the central schools of various towns in the Kou District to new locations.

<h3>Fujian Provincial Library Organizes Mobile Libraries; Director Chen Actively Plans Development, Adding Reading Rooms and Circulation Stations</h3>
<p>(Shaxian Correspondence) Since Chen Hongfei took over as director of the Fujian Provincial Library in Shaxian County, he has spared no effort in planning for development. It is now known that the library previously had the First Reading Room, but due to its location in a remote corner, reading was inconvenient. It has been agreed with the Special Party Department of the Fujian Military Control Zone to jointly operate a large-scale reading room in the lobby of the Zhongshan Hall. The hall is magnificent, with good air circulation and sufficient light, and can accommodate 200 people reading at the same time. It is scheduled to officially open on the anniversary of the fourth year of the War of Resistance. There are more than 40 kinds of domestic and foreign newspapers, more than 100 kinds of magazines, hundreds of reference books, and thousands of general books and anti-Japanese war reading materials. The number of readers is extremely crowded every day. Previously, the Third Reading Room of the library was located in the Shuinan East Station, but the reading room was small and could only accommodate a dozen or so readers, making development difficult. Recently, the Shaxian Zhongnan Travel Agency moved, and the library agreed to use the agency's lobby to jointly operate a large-scale reading room with the Provincial Transportation Company. Preparations are actively underway, and it is also planned to set up circulation book stations at various stations along the highway, such as Nanping, Sanyuan, Yong'an, and Liancheng. In order to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and facilitate reading during work breaks, the library has selected over a thousand books and established a mobile library, adopting the principle of "books seeking readers" specifically for public institutions in the county such as hospitals, citizens' schools, and social organizations. In addition, Chen Hongfei went to Fuzhou some time ago, as Fuzhou has just been recovered and all parties are in great need of spiritual nourishment, to prepare for the establishment of circulation stations and mobile libraries, and to restore the library's Fuzhou office, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yada Wireless Radio Vocational School</h3>

The class started on the 15th of this month and officially began on the 20th. New classes in the school's radio repair and communications departments have also started at the same time. There are still vacancies in each class.</p>

<h3>A Comparison of American and Japanese Economic Relations: What Impact Would a Complete Commercial Stoppage Have?</h3>
<p>— Huang Xinmeng</p>
<p>The Pacific problem is becoming increasingly serious, and the possibility of a US-Japan war seems imminent. However, the ultimate outcome of modern warfare still depends on the economic strength of the belligerent nations. Therefore, on the eve of a storm in the Pacific, I would like to use a statistical perspective to briefly outline the general state of US-Japan economic relations as follows:</p>
<p>According to an economic expert, under the slogan of building a "New Order in East Asia," two issues deserve attention:  There may come a day when US-Japan trade comes to a complete halt;  Japan may interfere with US imports of rubber and tin from overseas, as Japan is in a strong position to control these two commodities.</p>
<p>If US-Japan commercial relations are completely severed, Japan will suffer more than the United States. First, in 1939, Japan obtained a significant amount of needed foreign exchange from the United States, and US purchases from Japan accounted for one-third of Japan's total exports. This does not include other countries in the yen bloc. From 1937 to 1939, Japanese silk accounted for 83 percent of the US silk market, almost entirely owned by Japan. If this market is lost, Japan's economy will undoubtedly suffer a major blow, as it would reduce the amount of foreign exchange Japan urgently needs to obtain.</p>
<p>Second, Japan's imports are also largely dependent on the United States. In 1938, American goods accounted for 34 percent of Japan's imports. In this regard, it is evident that this would weaken Japan's fighting power, as Japan buys important military raw materials such as gasoline, iron, metal products, machinery, and copper from the United States.</p>
<p>Japan's Dependence on the United States</p>
<p>Eight types of raw materials used in wartime account for 98 percent of Japan's total imports from the United States. The following table shows the percentage of Japan's imports of these eight raw materials from the United States compared to those from other countries.</p>
<p>Commodity Percentage</p>
<p>Gasoline 66</p>
<p>Scrap Iron 91</p>
<p>Ferrous Alloys 98</p>
<p>Copper 92</p>
<p>Metals and Alloys 99.6</p>
<p>Cars and Car Parts 77</p>
<p>Metalworking Machinery 70</p>
<p>Aircraft and Aircraft Parts 63</p>
<p>In this respect, Japan's situation is indeed very difficult. Of the thirty-two important military raw materials, Japan has a surplus for export in only two types, is self-sufficient in three types, produces insufficient quantities for domestic use and must import sixteen types, and is completely dependent on other countries for the other eleven types. In 1939, 56 percent of Japan's military raw materials were imported from the United States, 21 percent from the United Kingdom, and 8 percent from British Malaya, Canada, and India. Therefore, once the United Kingdom and the United States cooperate and implement a commercial embargo against Japan, Japan will suffer the most severe impact.</p>
<p>Such cooperation, if possible, could reduce Japan's supply of steel, gasoline, machinery, and, to a lesser extent, copper. Although Japan might be able to purchase these from other sources, such as aggregated supplies, economic applications, and increased production in mainland Japan and occupied areas, the result would inevitably be decentralization and higher costs, which would clearly weaken Japan's fighting power.</p>
<p>What Use are Japanese Goods Imported into the US?</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can also pay attention to the situation in the United States. The following table shows the percentages of important commodities imported by the United States from Japan and from other countries.</p>
<p>Commodity Percentage</p>
<p>Fish Fillets and Fish Oil 52</p>
<p>Pottery and Porcelain 51</p>
<p>Silk Fabrics 42</p>
<p>Rags 99.5</p>
<p>Cotton Rugs 99</p>
<p>Crab Meat, Soy Sauce, etc. 81</p>
<p>Oil Cakes 77</p>
<p>Fresh Flowers 72</p>
<p>Toys 66</p>
<p>Hat Materials 55</p>
<p>Bleached Cotton Cloth 52</p>
<p>It is clear that these items are not very important. Although raw silk accounted for 94 percent of US imports from Japan in 1938, silk is not of vital importance to the national life.</p>
<p>However, the above statistics are still incomplete. We can further consider what would happen if the United States were to have its imports of rubber and tin completely cut off by the Japanese Navy one day.</p>
<p>Almost 98 percent of the world's rubber is produced in the Far East. In 1939, US imports of rubber were valued at US$167 million, and the importance of rubber is even greater than other products. Of this, 57 percent was purchased from British Malaya, 18 percent from the Dutch East Indies, and the rest from French Indochina and Ceylon.</p>
<p>Approximately three-quarters of the world's tin production comes from the Federated Malay States, Bolivia, and the Dutch East Indies. In 1938, the United States purchased 74 percent of its tin imports, in terms of quantity, from Malaya, 7 percent from the United Kingdom, 7 percent from the Dutch East Indies and Hong Kong, and 13 percent from other countries.</p>
<p>From the above, it is clear that US imports of rubber and tin rely entirely on supplies from the Federated Malay States and the Dutch East Indies. But in the event of an accident, and these imports are hindered, can the United States find other markets to supply them?</p>
<p>The United States Has Many Options</p>
<p>According to a recent report by the Tax Commission, the United States consumed 590,100 tons of rubber in 1939, at a price of 17 cents per pound, but this had risen to 20 cents by 1940.</p>
<p>How much rubber has the United States contracted for in the coming year? In this regard, we can recall that in June 1939, the United States agreed with the United Kingdom that the United Kingdom would exchange 85,000 tons of rubber for 60,000 bales of cotton from the United States. By August 1940, half of the rubber specified in the contract had been delivered. The Rubber Reserve Company and the Financial Construction Company have close ties and have obtained a loan of US$140 million from the US government, with a contract to deliver 180,000 tons of rubber in the coming year, at a price of 17 to 20 cents per pound.</p>
<p>In terms of other sources, synthetic rubber is not a major factor because it is very expensive, at 65 cents per pound. Although when mass-produced, it could be supplied to the United States when needed at a price as low as 12 cents per pound. However, it is feared that it will be at least three years before production reaches this level.</p>
<p>In 1939, the United States consumed 170,000 tons of reclaimed rubber. According to experts, in the event of an accident, US rubber factories could produce 300,000 tons of reclaimed rubber.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is an extreme desire to encourage South American countries to increase rubber production. This goal could be achieved in about ten years, but the problem is that it requires large-scale US investment and the eradication of insect and disease damage to South American rubber trees.</p>
<p>Regarding rubber, we can draw the following conclusion. US reserves are very thin. According to a survey conducted in August 1940, US reserves at that time were only sufficient for four months of use. According to the most optimistic statistics, US rubber reserves, if imports were cut off, could last for one year. This statistic is entirely based on economics; at that time, unnecessary industries will reduce or eliminate rubber consumption, plus imports from the United Kingdom. The twelve-month period could very well allow the United States to research and convert to the use of synthetic rubber and import from South America.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must also consider increasing imports from the Dutch East Indies and the Federated Malay States. Regarding this issue, it depends on the attitude of the International Rubber Regulation Committee, which is largely controlled by the United Kingdom and determines how much rubber can be exported. In the past year, their policy has fully taken into account the interests of the United States, without being affected in the slightest. As a result, the quantity of rubber shipped to the United States has also been considerable and sufficient for consumption, and the price has also been set at a reasonable level.</p>
<p>Another conclusion is that the US rubber problem is very serious, but not insurmountable. Much depends on how rubber is transported once a problem arises, and whether the United States is preparing for this now. But another problem is that although the United Kingdom also controls a part, the source of rubber is largely supplied by Asia. Once there is international control, it will cause difficulties for the United States. Even Bolivia could supply a large amount of tin production at that time, but for various reasons, it can be seen that most of Bolivia's tin has always been purchased by the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>The United States has considered various methods to prevent a tin panic. At the same time, it has obtained the consent of the International Tin Committee to allow the United States to purchase 5,000 tons per year, and it is also worthwhile to discuss finding other markets for tin. However, how much tin the United States currently has in reserve is not well known to outsiders. However, in any case, if transportation problems were to arise sooner rather than later, although it would not be a fatal blow, the problem would always be there.</p>
<p>Japan's Fatal Wound</p>
<p>In conclusion, we can say that if US-Japan commercial relations are completely severed, especially if initiated by the United States or jointly promoted by the United Kingdom and the United States, it can be proven that Japan would suffer more severely than the United States. If Japan has the power to prevent US imports of rubber and tin, the United States will also be affected because imports of these two important commodities will inevitably be reduced. However, the United States would not be defeated, but the blow to Japan would be fatal.</p>
<p>This article is entirely based on economic issues. Although future developments will depend on the policies and strategies of the countries involved, much will depend on the policy that the United States adopts towards the Far East in the future, which will determine the final fate!</p>
<h3>Measures for the Bureau of Rice to Sell Rice at Stable Prices: A Preliminary Plan for a Certificate Purchase System</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiyu</p>
<p>The purpose of the proposed improvement to the Bureau of Rice's sales method in this article is to enable consumers who genuinely need rice to obtain the rice they need in the simplest way, with the least amount of manpower.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, it seems that a certificate purchase system can be implemented under the following principles: to discuss with the authorities and people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of implementing this system is to enable the bureau to reasonably distribute foreign rice, eliminate hoarding and manipulation, and reduce the threat of rice merchants in the market. (Note)</p>
<p>(2) Those who want to purchase publicly sold rice must first go through application procedures and purchase it with a certificate. The applicant for the certificate must fill out an application form with the nearest police station, Public Works Bureau, Shanghai Municipal Council, or designated rice shop or consumer cooperative based on their most recent month's housing tax ticket. The housing tax ticket will be kept for verification, and the person who receives the application form will give a duplicate receipt as proof.</p>
<p>(3) The application form must state: the number of rice-eating people in the entire house, the approximate amount of monthly income, the method, type, and weight of rice purchased in the two months before the application, the current address, and other important matters such as whether there is rice allowance from the organization or meals in the organization; the amount of rice requested to be purchased each month should also be carefully noted; if there is any rice already purchased and stored in the household, it should also be stated. The person in charge of the application must sign and seal the application form, or use a fingerprint instead; in order to receive the rice purchase certificate after receiving the approval notice, based on the duplicate receipt and the original seal. Regardless of whether it is approved or not, the housing tax ticket will also be returned based on the duplicate receipt.</p>
<p>(4) The issuance of rice purchase certificates will be handled by the review committee jointly formed by the two concession authorities, with an investigation team attached. The review procedures must be completed within seven days from the date of receipt of the application form.</p>
<p>(5) After receiving the application form, the investigation team will send uniformed personnel to investigate each household. When necessary, they may also investigate the service organization. If the investigator has any questions, the applicant should answer sincerely and shall not conceal or misrepresent the facts or engage in bribery.</p>
<p>(6) When the review committee issues rice purchase certificates, in addition to relying on the applicant's economic situation and the investigation report, it has the right to increase or decrease the amount applied for, and shall not exceed the following standards:</p>
<p>(A) For those aged 15 and above, 2.25 dou of rice per person per month.</p>
<p>(B) For those aged 10 to 15, 2 dou of rice per person per month.</p>
<p>(C) For those aged 5 to 10, 1 dou of rice per person per month. (Note)</p>
<p>(7) On the rice purchase certificate, the district should be noted according to the district method of the rice purchase certificate registration ledger; this certificate is only valid within the district for purchasing rice from the sales office. The certificate also has a number, and the applicant's name, gender, age, address, occupation and other items are listed in detail; regarding the approved rice quantity, it is listed in both Chinese and Arabic numerals, and the number of the rice purchase certificate is stamped with a prickly hard seal to prevent alteration.</p>
<p>(8) The effective expiry date of the rice purchase certificate should be uniform, such as the end of January, the end of April, the end of July, and the end of November. After the expiry date, a new application form must be filled out, and the review committee will reissue a new certificate based on the facts and investigation report.</p>
<p>(9) When the review committee issues the rice purchase certificates, it should register the rice purchase certificates in districts and compile a rice purchase certificate registration ledger, which will be stored in the bureau and issued to each rice store or consumer cooperative for reference.</p>
<p>(10) Any existing consumer cooperative or rice store in the city that is willing to sell and distribute bureau rice shall, after applying and being approved, be subject to the supervision of the bureau, and the bureau will give it a reasonable profit at the specified value.</p>
<p>(11) If the service provided by each sales office is indeed excellent and has made outstanding achievements, after investigation and verification, the bureau will reward it and announce its name to commend it.</p>
<p>(12) The bureau should uniformly issue each sales office with a specific style of seal for inspection; the bureau may charge for the cost of engraving this seal.</p>
<p>(13) Before selling bureau rice, each sales store should check the rice purchase certificate presented against the security ledger sent by the bureau to ensure that it matches, and then sell the rice within the limit: and fill in the date, quantity, and stamp the seal issued by the bureau on the rice purchase certificate; at the same time, a special ledger should be prepared to record the rice purchase certificate number, the quantity sold, the date, and the price. (Note)</p>
<p>(14) The holder of the rice purchase certificate may purchase rice from the sales office within the specified area at the fixed price within the monthly quota specified on the certificate, regardless of the number of times; however, the quantity of each purchase shall not be less than one sheng.</p>
<p>(15) The approved quantity for each month, regardless of whether it has been purchased in full, is only allowed to be purchased within the month and shall not be transferred or pre-purchased to other months.</p>
<p>(16) The rice purchase certificate shall not be used as a substitute; when necessary, the bureau may indicate on the certificate that it is limited to the responsible applicant's own use.</p>
<p>(17) In the event of changes in household registration such as death, moving out, moving in, and birth, which cause changes in the required amount of rice, the responsible applicant shall, if necessary, report the facts and refill out the application form to reissue a new certificate.</p>
<p>(18) The application procedures for organizations, groups, factories, businesses, schools, etc. to purchase rice shall be handled in the same way as ordinary households, unless otherwise specified. (Note)</p>
<p>(19) When restaurants, hotels, and food operators apply to purchase rice, the amount of rice required shall be estimated and certified by the trade association, and a statistical table of the amount of rice sold each month in the five months before the application shall be submitted; other regulations applicable to ordinary households. (Note)</p>
<p>(20) If the bureau finds that the applicant has falsely reported household registration or other fraudulent behavior, in addition to appropriately punishing the investigators, it may immediately revoke the applicant's rice purchase certificate and cancel it, and notify each sales office of the number of the rice purchase certificate at any time, so that it can be similarly canceled in the ledger. The applicant who has been canceled shall not be entitled to the benefit of applying again within three months from the date of cancellation. (Note)</p>
<p>(21) If a rice purchase certificate has not been used for more than two months, unless the original applicant can provide a legitimate reason in advance, the bureau will investigate and verify the facts and notify each sales office to cancel it; however, the responsible applicant may reapply.</p>
<p>(22) In addition to refusing to sell to those who falsely report household registration and fraudulently purchase rice, the police may also punish the responsible applicant according to the circumstances. (Note)</p>
<p>(23) Sales offices shall not refuse to sell bureau rice during normal business hours.</p>
<p>(24) If sales personnel or personnel handling rice purchase certificates are found to have engaged in bribery, they shall be severely punished according to law. The aforementioned personnel includes investigators. (Note)</p>
<p>(25) Regardless of whether it is a private individual or an organization, anyone who knows that an applicant is impersonating, intending to illegally profit, or is suspected of hoarding, and is not for actual consumption, may report to the nearest police station by name. The police station has an absolute obligation to keep such whistleblower information confidential. If it is true, they will be appropriately rewarded.

<h3>A Tool for Cultivating Children: A Family Letter is Worth a Fortune</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Thinking of the upbringing of children, there are many fathers who live away in other cities, and therefore cannot fulfill the responsibility of teaching every day. At this time, family letters become a powerful tool for educating children.</p>
<p>Many fathers who are not good at words but have extremely high ideas can also use letters to teach their children. For many children who live in schools, writing family letters has become a very important task.</p>
<p>Many famous scholars in Chinese history have done their best to teach their children. Their educational goals are based on diligence, frugality, filial piety, etiquette, love of learning, and nobility. In the collection of family letters of famous people in history published by the Commercial Press, there are "Eating is not about fine meat, but about filling the stomach; clothing is not about colorful patterns, but about covering the body," "Yu did not love the inch of jade but loved the inch of time," "Filial piety, respect, benevolence, and righteousness are the most important of all virtues," "Leaving gold to your children is not as good as leaving them a classic," and other insightful sentences.</p>
<p>In Zhuge Liang's Admonition to His Son, there are sentences such as "The conduct of a gentleman is to cultivate himself with tranquility and nourish his virtue with frugality. Without indifference, there is no way to clarify his aspirations; without tranquility, there is no way to achieve far-reaching goals." In Shi Guifang's family letters, there are even words such as "Tao Kan transported tiles and claimed to practice labor, because there are things that are difficult to say to people directly. Labor gives rise to good intentions, and cultivating virtue and nurturing the body are all in it. Leisure gives rise to delusions, and losing virtue and harming the body are all in it." Such words and deeds, even in modern times, will not lose their value.</p>
<p>In the United States, there is also the book Twenty Family Letters. It was written by a wealthy food merchant to his son and compiled by the chief writer of the Saturday Evening Post. It also contains many profound sayings. For example, regarding education, he said: "When education is around you, you should try your best to seize it. You will find that education is something scattered all over the world, and everyone can acquire it endlessly." He also said: "The greatest purpose of education is to create a beautiful character, and then knowledge." The whole book is full of humorous and insightful words, and has become a good book loved by everyone in American families.</p>
<p>In a small town in the United States, there is a family because all the boys are away in other cities, their mother collects the family letters received from all over the country, edits them, types them into several copies, and sends them to each son living in other cities. This is also a method worth adopting.</p>

<h3>Announcement of the Essay Contest, Seventh: A Cold-Hearted Father</h3>
<p>— Fei Xia</p>
<p>From the time I started to have memories until now, I have almost never seen my father smile. This is a strange and inappropriate thing between us, father and daughter.</p>
<p>The economic situation in my family is not very difficult. My father works in a certain government office and has a considerable monthly income, so it is not very difficult to support a family of six. Therefore, what makes my father cold-hearted is definitely not an economic problem, but a habit, a habit of elders wanting to maintain authority over younger generations.</p>
<p>Every morning, my father sits solemnly on the sofa with a沉着face, reading the newspaper from the first page to the last, as if he wants to swallow it. Rarely, he might pace around the room. At this time, we - his children - must "sit upright" and wait for breakfast, otherwise we will be condemned by him. After breakfast, it is our world, and we fly to school.</p>
<p>Similarly, at lunch or dinner, we can see a stern father sitting at the head of the table.</p>
<p>Sometimes when my siblings and I are talking and laughing, my father suddenly appears, and the air suddenly becomes tense. The conversation stops, and the ignorant younger siblings slip out one by one. Only my parents and I remain in the room. I often feel sad for this situation, and at the same time, I feel sad for my father. How can the feelings between our two generations be so bad?</p>
<p>Not only that, but my father is also very stiff with my mother. There is no conversation or discussion between them, and "cooperation" is never possible when there is something going on in the family.</p>
<p>But strangely enough, my father and mother have never quarreled.</p>
<p>The separation between my father and us is deepening. I am concerned about this point, so I try my best to eliminate it while it is still possible to eliminate it.</p>
<p>Once, I finally mustered up the courage to walk up to my father, who was reading the newspaper, and stammered:</p>
<p>"Dad! I want...we..."</p>
<p>"Hmm!" My father raised his head and said with some weariness.</p>
<p>I suddenly felt very uncomfortable, and I couldn't say anything anymore. My courage was driven away by my father's coldness.</p>
<p>I began to worry about my younger siblings and myself. All the teenagers in the world have a sweet home, but we four can't enjoy it at all. When I saw the背影, I couldn't help but shed tears. I even envied the poor families as long as their parents are gentle. Not having my father's love will become the regret of my life. (A fee of ten yuan will be given to the Family Monthly for twelve issues throughout the year.)</p>
<p>Editor's note: The situation that Ms. Fei Xia has suffered is common in Chinese families. In fact, isn't it the same in foreign countries? In "Gu Yuan", isn't the father in the Barrett family just as cold-hearted? Many fathers put on a cold attitude in order to maintain their dignity, but perhaps they have troubles in their work, so when they get home, they can't show a kind and pleasant appearance. I hope these fathers don't keep their troubles to themselves. Sometimes talking with their children can eliminate troubles and at the same time enjoy the fun of family. As for the children, like Ms. Fei Xia, don't worry too much. If possible, you can try to make your father feel at peace and happy. Family happiness requires everyone to work together to seek and create. Next issue of the essay contest announcement: A wife in the countryside.</p>

<h3>A Family Awaiting Aid</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shenbao Family section,</p>
<p>I originally had a family of above-average means, but six years ago, my husband suddenly lost his job due to a drastic reduction in salary. He resigned rather than accept it. Over these six years, the cost of living has risen daily, making it difficult to sustain our family. He subsequently developed a stomach ailment and passed away this spring, leaving behind three children. Our close relatives are as distant as ice and charcoal, and several requests for assistance have gone unanswered. At a time when prices are soaring, how can I, a weak and incapable woman, support four lives? I earnestly request that you, sir, guide me to a path to save our four lives. Your merit would be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
<p>Yu Hua</p>
<p>Ms. Jinhua:</p>
<p>In your letter, you did not mention the ages of your children, whether they are young or attending school. Are you able to do any work yourself to generate some income to support your family's expenses? What is your current financial situation? We hope you can provide us with a detailed account of your family's circumstances so that we can publish your situation in this newspaper. Perhaps among our readers, there are those who would be willing to help you.</p>

<h3>A Week's Home-Style Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Snow pea sprouts are now on the market again. Among vegetables, they can be considered a delicacy because they are often combined with shrimp. Any banquet often includes stir-fried snow pea sprouts with shrimp. Before snow pea sprouts are available, green peas serve as a substitute, but once snow pea sprouts appear, they replace green peas. The price of shrimp has recently become prohibitively expensive, so stir-fried snow pea sprouts with shrimp is a rare sight on the tables of economical families. While large shrimp are too expensive, small shrimp can still be enjoyed. Once shelled, they can be stir-fried with snow pea sprouts. If shrimp is not used, stir-fried snow pea sprouts with shredded pork are also delicious. If there are vegetarian elderly in the family, you can also have plain stir-fried snow pea sprouts. However, like alfalfa, it requires a generous amount of oil.</p>

<p>Preparation: First, boil the crab until cooked, then extract the crab meat. Next, peel the shrimp and remove the shrimp meat. Heat lard in a wok until it boils. Immediately add the crab meat and shrimp meat together and stir-fry briefly. Then add an appropriate amount of soy sauce, cooking wine, soy sauce essence, water chestnut flour slurry, scallion pieces, and ginger mince. Continue to stir-fry until the seasoning is balanced, then remove from the heat. The stir-frying must be done skillfully, otherwise the shrimp meat will become overcooked and lose its freshness. This dish truly combines two delicacies. Crab alone is already fresh and fatty, but adding shrimp meat is the icing on the cake.</p>

<h3>Eradicate the City's Greatest Enemy - Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>In Madam Hardoon, Luo Jialing's announcement, we see the words "...diagnosed with tuberculosis on August 1st, already in the third stage, urgently needing air injections..." Even for such a wealthy widow possessing assets of tens of millions, living in the vast Aili Garden and enjoying a heavenly life, she is still a victim of tuberculosis. It goes without saying that others are even more vulnerable.</p>
<p>This great enemy of the city is indeed rampant and chilling. According to statistics, out of Shanghai's four million population, at least 320,000 people suffer from this terrible disease. However, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association has risen to challenge it, vowing to eradicate this scourge with its utmost efforts. We thank these enthusiastic individuals who have sounded the alarm, urging everyone to mobilize and eliminate this tuberculosis demon!</p>
<p>Rather than saying we are working and donating money for others, frankly, we are doing it for ourselves. To protect our own health, we must first eliminate the disease demons lurking around us, preying on people. It's like fighting a fire. If the flames in neighboring houses are not put out, can you guarantee that your own house will not be affected?</p>
<p>Eradicating tuberculosis in the city is everyone's responsibility. The members of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, undeterred by difficulties, have taken the lead. All citizens should unite to support them so that their fundraising goal of one million yuan can be achieved as soon as possible. We also hope that this tuberculosis prevention work can be extended from Shanghai, the only major city, to cities across the country. Let everyone be aware of the terror of this "white terror" and seek permanent liberation from the shackles of this debilitating disease.</p>
<h3>How Infants and Toddlers Should Avoid Tuberculosis Reducing Contact With Patients Reduces the Chance of Infection</h3>
<p>— Diqing</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is not something one is born with. This can give mothers a comforting belief: tuberculosis is not hereditary. It can be said to be an infectious disease. These germs are invisible to the naked eye and are often transmitted by adults caring for children.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to prevent children from being infected with bacteria. Prevent anyone suffering from tuberculosis from transmitting bacteria to children through their oral breathing, saliva, or bacteria left on teacups, towels, or food.</p>
<p>Anyone suffering from tuberculosis, whether father, mother, relative, caregiver, or other acquaintance, poses a risk as long as they have close contact with the child. Children should be kept away from these people to reduce the chance of infection.</p>
<p>A difficult question arises. What if the child's mother has tuberculosis? Mothers should sacrifice some of their natural love for their children to prevent them from being infected with tuberculosis. Separating the child from the mother may not be easy in practice. Then, the mother must pay attention to her every move, being careful to prevent bacteria from being transmitted to the child's mouth through saliva, coughing, or using towels. The danger does not lie in breastfeeding, but in breathing, coughing, and touching.</p>
<p>Cow's milk and mother's milk can both carry bacteria, so only milk that has been tested for tuberculosis or sterilized milk should be used. Otherwise, it should be boiled before being fed to the child.</p>
<p>After making various efforts to protect the child from infection, attention should also be paid to cultivating the child's natural resistance. There are several simple methods that must be diligently followed:</p>
<p>Ventilation: In the first few months of a baby's life, the baby should be kept in a well-ventilated area. When he sleeps in the cradle, his face should always be exposed to air circulation, and his arms should be able to move freely, which can help the baby's lungs expand. The windows in the room should be kept open. Fresh, clean air is essential.</p>
<p>Skin: Some mothers seem to think that all that is needed for a child's skin is to wash it regularly and apply powder. In fact, there are other things to consider besides cleanliness, because the skin has other functions besides covering the body. In temperate weather, children's skin should be exposed to the air and sunlight as much as possible. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Contradiction</h3>
<p>— Lü Jinglang</p>
<p>Gatekeeper: Hey, admission ticket!</p>
<p>Visitor: I happen to have it with me. Do you want to take a look?</p>
<p>Gatekeeper: If you have it, I don't need to see it. If you don't have it, then I need to see it.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fourteen: The Life of Beating Up Heroes</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stage was too large, and his own age and physique were truly not suitable for such strenuous effort. He barely managed to tumble to the edge of the stage when a bout of dizziness caused him to fall on the carpet. Needless to say, the audience responded with a chorus of boos, mixed with many extremely unpleasant jeers. If it weren't for the makeup on his face, he might not have had the courage to get up from the ground again.</p>
<p>Because the purpose of making fun of him had been achieved, and his "true talents and skills" had been clearly demonstrated, the martial arts performers on stage and Zhang Yincai himself all made faces at him. When sparring with weapons, his back and legs were poked forcefully at least dozens of times.</p>
<p>Sweat poured down like summer rain. When Begonia removed his makeup, he was almost completely soaked.</p>
<p>"Old Wang, look how pitiful that newcomer is. After you guys messed with him today, see, the tears on his face haven't even dried yet!" A clown actor sitting on a trunk said quietly to a martial arts performer standing next to him.</p>
<p>The martial arts performer just chuckled drily.</p>
<p>Begonia found it very strange when he heard this. He remembered that he had not cried. His face should be all sweat. How could people mistake it for tears? As he thought this, he secretly raised his hand and touched his eye sockets. Unexpectedly, his eyelashes were indeed wet. He truly couldn't tell whether it was sweat or tears! (264)</p>
