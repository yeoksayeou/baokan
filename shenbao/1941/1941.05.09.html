<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國護航與日本</h3>
<p>關於遠東局熱的最近之將來。昨日社評嘗說明目前稍見髯靜，雖是事實，却依然隱藏着厝火；而其如何進展，還視整個國際變化爲轉移。所謂整個國際，旣非一元而是多元、亦即很難抉取其中任何一端，視爲機樞所在，成爲唯一重心。所謂變化，或有跡象爲朕兆，或有綫索可追求；但綫索與跡象旣屬不可必得，而多方激盪，多方波折所造就的後果，非有一定的程式以獲得一定的答案：這雖在造因者，亦萬難把握於事前。以日本處心積慮所發動的對華侵略，豈不以爲予求予取，必能恣所欲爲：那知被中國拖了四年，至今不得已而高懸了解決所謂中國事變的目標，憧憬之爲理想的境界，事實上却欲罷而不能。又如軸心在歐洲，一路如所計劃了的勢如破竹，乃一頓挫於巴爾幹半島的非用兵不可，迄今還是無法向英國作正面的進攻。又如三國同盟的締約簽字，以爲若此推行所謂新秩序，必能風行草偃，使一切國族望風而靡；那知祗有鐵蹄踐踏所及的範疇纔得勉強拓爲新秩序的畫面。局部的演進猶且事與願違，整個的國際變化豈是那一孤家寡人所得主宰！旣往的片段猶且予人以意外之感，則未來之波紋豈可捉摸！蓋最後的成敗自有不可抗違的鐵則，人類文明的進步將如地球的公轉私轉而決不逆轉，然其間的風雲雷雨則幻變不常，氣象萬千。</p>
<p>在遠東，日本却想出賣其風雲雷雨。昨日東京電訉，日外部發言人表示松岡聘問柏林的時候，德國方面從未要求日本在歐戰中援助德國；這與三國盟約的第三條所相約者，儼然別成一個面具。又表示其似乎有恃無恐而日美國之援助不足以挽救英倫，然而無法解釋或掩飾德國何以爲了美國援英而怒若瘋在。所謂軸心國倘若受人攻擊，日本將於逼不得已時，決意履行其義務，而使意想不到之日美戰爭，竟然爆發云云，藉以表示竟有主動的對美採取軍事行動之勇；然而他所口稱的意想不到，正是他所心頭的憂惶萬狀。總之，一面暗示日本對於三國盟約的若即若離，可眞可假；一面手擎着紙面條款、滿望善價而沽。一面惡咒惡罵於英國必敗，善頌善禱於德國必勝，盡其爲盟友的人情；一面則聲勢洶洶，其實無非爲了美國當局準備武裝護航，遂想以此談片，爲美國反對護航案的人們張目。誠因美國以軍火戰具，援助民治國家，雖有偉大意義，然是吾由美國自行護送到達戰區，尤爲重要關鍵。援助的意義，在於盡心盡力。護航的意義，在於盡心盡力之外，對友邦更求客觀的功效，亦即對自己的心力，負起了貫澈的信念與責任。原來護航辦法，當然有其可能的最嚴重反應，當然經過了美國當局的最嚴重玫慮；體察美國陸長史汀生氏與海長諾克斯氏昨今所表示，可知無論護航所得反應如何嚴重，美國當局却已抱定了不顧反應而實行護航的決心；美國方面所剩餘的，祇是輿情成熟的問題，祗是時間的問題。這所響影於浸略國家者：倘若美國止於供給軍火戰具，則無所忌憚的以軍火戰具爲攻襲對象；倘若美國實行護航，則是吾更以美國的護航爲攻襲對象？是吾以護航的美國爲攻襲對象？使侵略國家不能不從頭再作最嚴重的考慮。</p>
<p>護航先到英國，影響先及德義；顧以觀察所得，侵略國家方面對此感覺躊躇者，却是日本尤甚於德義。德義兩國雖願美國孤立於戰爭漩渦之外，然實際上德義早已無所企求於美國，亦早已置之悍然不顧之列；故美國若實行護航，德義殆將儘所可能的取巧，從事攻襲而避免與美國發生正面的大衝突，然而絕不躊躇，不辭衝突。至於日本，明知德義與美國將因德義之攻襲美國護航而終必發生衝突，是使日本遭逢不再能閃鑠其辭的課題，即德義與美衝突之已，三國盟約究竟如何解釋？對美究竟是吾根據了盟約義務而作戰？這是日本所獨有的躊躇；而日本躊躇後的決定，當然與遠東局勢相密切關聯。</p>

<p>勞合喬治　激昂發言</p>
<p>昨日辯論　　相勞合喬治首先發言、頗形激昂、略謂、人人皆贊成政府信仟案、惟政府戰事行政部份、確有使人失望與不滿意之處、外相艾登　及土國之忠貞、但對於土國允許德船通過博斯波魯斯峽而入韃靼尼爾峽、以奪取希臘某島事、則一字不提何也、政府宜以更多情報供給議院、英國非幼稚國家、曾經許多難關、縱聞不利消息、亦不致發生惶駭、美國史汀生之言論、使人欣感、足徴美國已了解時局之嚴重性、惟英國不可作將得何種援助或司得援助如何迅速之奢望、上次大戰時、美國置其艦隊於大西洋、而日本則擔保太平洋、今若美國欲使英國得與德國並駕齊驅、而追過之、則其所當然者、須多於渠目　所已聞者、渠謂首相車行考慮人力分配之全部問題、宜設立眞正戰爭行政會、以三四人組成之、不問他事、但專研究戰事問題、而　　相以考量妥善之謨猷、</p>
<p>英端重視　對土關係</p>

<p>政府機構　不遽改組</p>

<p>維持航業　決無問題</p>
<p>首相末言及美國對英源源不斷之援助、謂在一九四一年英國或能維持其最低限度之必要航業、迨一九四二年美國商船建造、定已大增、渠巳獲有美國造船之保證、加以英國自己之造船程序、一九四二年定可應付裕如、如能支持至一九四三年、則一切問題當可迎刃而解、羅斯福總統所宣布之海上巡邏事、使美國减少其在大西洋中之一部份工作、但英國尚需更多援助、當可在許多方面獲有更多助力、人有謂英國將得其所需之各種援助者、但渠於此則審慎言之、因英國閣員不能預述美國政策也、有人民一萬二千萬之偉大民主國、一旦發動、其心理化爲實物之整個進展、不難想見、此希特勒之所以畏懼美國、而未對之宣戰也、英相續言曰、「余從未低估吾人之難題與危險、吾人無一時一刻不爲生存而戰、但希特勒亦有其難題、如吾人始終團結、盡心竭力、互相扶助、如一大家庭然、則余敢謂最後勝利必屬吾人」云、（八日路透電）</p>

<h3>糧食　大眾等待工部局來米　米銷驟清米價復跌　四月份到米五十七萬餘包　更見囤戶操縱之萬分不該</h3>
<p>洋米市跌風未已、高次趨、而形勢疲弱、後市似尚有再度跌落之可能、蓋兩租界平售一舉、勢在必行、首批小絞五萬包已在途中、首批貢米聞亦電促付裝、二批三批相繼來滬之後、則市上棧存各米、在客銷停頓中、更無相當之出路、因此大戶雖圖掙扎、實已到達窮途、目下只有儘先貶價早脫、或能沾著一些微利、故開市後浮戶求脫最力、無奈銷路平常、蓋除急需者外、凡可等待工部局米到再買者、寧可暫時忍飢、不欲購此貴米、因之店銷既清、客銷不動、囤戶亦思有所吐出、暴厲之跌風復起、一路向下、勢如奔瀑、頃刻之間、若小絞瀉落六元之巨、上身貨只開百廿四元、中關者百二十三元、至此稍有問津、市色轉平、須臾即告收市、結果收價、一號陳西貢為百三十五六元、一號暹邏百二十八元、火絞百二十六元、敏黨百二十三四元、小絞百二十三四元、東京　尖百十一元、碎尖百零二元、次至九十五元、至於其他二號西貢暹邏等貨、悉未做開、</p>

<p>較之三月份　進口少　十一萬四千一百餘包、查本年四月底為止、四個月內洋米到滬、為數驚人、共有二百二十七萬八千八百餘包之鉅、故米價高昂、顯係奸商壟斷所致、近賴當局統制得宜、並與港政府議定直接運銷、一般囤戶始覺威脅、故市場上價格稍見回落、苞米價亦隨之下降、前日（七日）渣華公司芝巴德號輪由港運來苞米三千餘包、停靠藍煙囪碼頭起卸、聞工部局採購之仰光小絞米、由港運來　約十二日到滬、昨據可靠方面消息、或可提早一二天到埠、亦未可知、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米及糯米去路雖仍不暢、但市貨有限、貨主尚無急脫之意、故市面雖亦受洋米影響、不若洋米之狂瀉不已、計錫粳百四十二元、崑粳百四十元、南港早晚稻百三十五六元、香港白元百二十五六元、糯　百十五六元、較之前市略貶一二元、</p>
<h3>粉市人氣漸虛</h3>
<p>洋粉市況、已入徘徊之態、蓋以連日米價步跌後、人心已感虛弱、零星散囤、逐有傾吐、金龍牌坎粉一度小至三十二元、始引起本街實銷與南洋幫客戶之問津、昨日開市、形勢尚佳、計由本客進辦金龍粉二三千包、價三十二元五六角、及澳粉花烏牌牌三十二元八九角、洋砲臺粉三十三元二三角、惟後市賣氣復濃、因傳工部局決定以小絞米五萬包平賣、價只一百十元、米價再跌、人心看小、進戶觀望、迄後市已步鬆三四角、華廠平賣粉仍為二十九元、照原額供給由指定號商辦去、小麥無市、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆油猛跌六元</h3>

<h3>金融　美捲入戰渦　遠期美匯　乏人收進</h3>

<h3>一片賣聲中　金價所跌轉猛</h3>
<p>昨日金價烚赤暗市、跌風復熾、自晨至晚、竟無一時不在迂迴之下退中、價已破入六千六百元大關內、各方人心奇虛、實內盛傳美國海長亦主張以軍艦護航、眾料恐從此捲入漩渦、外滙猛鬆、美滙遠月竟有供無求、價已長逾投機家所看上檔五元二五大關以上、故場內雖有巨空滙票商大豐及金號德大均多、各進一萬兩以上、但在證券幫益大·同康永、　孚·熾大·及恆記·明豐·義　·德成　鑫源等慘烈賣風中、供求勢仍懸殊、價由晨開後之六千六百四十五元、　盤退迄晚收前之六千五百四十八元、終猛跌九十八元、收後退見六千五百四十五元、全日交易七八萬兩、現金金號成記先售予益大一百兩、後即來復進、明豐及時和各五十兩、價照期交高一百三十元、再進萬豐一百兩、祥和五十兩、均高一百三十五元、午刻高一百四十元、德孚要進、下午誠達售予成記一百兩、高一百六十元、後寶康出老天寶及永豐餘各五十兩、高一百七十元、然以期貨傾跌比上日仍約小五十元、首飾金反曾掛高達七百元、終爲六百九十五元、軋平、關金等未更、</p>
<p>烚赤猛跌近百元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、因美滙硬至五元二五難賣、故人心復虛、九點十五分開市即低二十元、計六千六百三十元、時　瞬息、益大·德大·義元來進、回升至六千六百四十五元、鑫源售出、於交易清稀中遜至六千六百三十三元、德大仍翻多力進、抬至六千六百四十二元、終盤於六千六百三十五元左右甚久、十點三刻、明豐·義豐·同康永·德孚力售忽切、且人心帶虛、降至六千六百二十元左右、又稍站住、午收前退至六千六百元、新豐永猛進千餘兩、稍形提上、午收六午六百零七元、收後德孚猛售、降至六千五百九十五元、下午市勢更虛、二點開市即降至六千五百八十元、比午收價低一十七元、大豐又進、抬至六千五百八十五元、益大·德大·熾大爭來售出、外滙報松、人心更軟、立降三十五元、至六千五百五十元、爲大豐·德大巨額傾進、硬提上至六千五百七十元、及聞美金已賣硬至五元三一二五、德孚·義元·義豐·熾大再售、又退至六千五百四十八元、爲德大·大豐辦進、升至六千五百六十五元、四點收市復退至六千五百五十二元、比前日午收降九十八元、照五月美金五元二八一二五結價、爲六千五百九十四元、計撳四十二元、全日有九十七元上落、收市後降至六千五百四十五元、現金號之本牌金、售價比烚赤期交價高一百九十元、收進比售出低六十元、現標金無價無市、</p>

<h3>外幣跌勢尚微</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤市價、雖猛跌百元光景、然英美金鎊跌勢則緩、結果僅各降一元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票一度退至六角六分、卒以十八元六角八分收盤、比上日軋跌二角、香港票亦趨低落、晚市退爲四元七角半、日金票及朝鮮票均無變動、前者仍站二元一角一分原盤、後者仍站一元八角二分原價、</p>
<h3>證券　內債難漲跌亦不易</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市況、仍在毫無精神疲軟狀態中、一市場集會、會數雖多、皆非常懈怠、在集市時間以內、多數均不入場買賣、而袖手旁觀　可見多空雙方堅持之甚、所以行市欲漲不能、欲跌亦不易、必俟環境上發生強度的變化、人心震撼、市況始有波動、現在仍在靜候時機、昨日上午順昌買進怡泰同康亦有買進、聯益鴻大聯和賣出、有過之無不及、午後同康仍有買進、鑫源亦有需要、恆康九成恆孚均有賣出、仍在供過於求狀況中、故結果仍小一角半至五角半、甲種未有上落　成交約七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交南洋煙草公司股一百股、價爲二十元零七角半、</p>
<p>眾業公所股市開盤、維持原價不動、旋因利空謠言熾盛、買方陣容、突告動搖、各股開始下瀉、下午賣風加劇、收盤雖有些微回上、夫勢仍依柔軟非凡、</p>

<h3>紗花　大戶痛斬　紗價直下　雙馬已進五百四十元關</h3>
<p>上日日昂之紗市、昨則又向下降、此因太平洋風雲緊張、而外滙放長、標金大落、同時實際交易又寥寥無幾、於是一般高價購進之戶、心意杌陧不安而出籠、至於浮多鑒於環境不利、忍痛斬結、市盤乃步向下游矣、二十支雙馬高價為一千五百七十一元、低價為一千五百四十六元、午後初做一千五百四十一元、證券幫扒空、回至一千五百四十六元、但某大投機者將多額限價一千五百四十元、斬結一千包、跌進五百四十元關內、爲一千五百三十八元、盈利散戶撈進、又至一千五百四十五元、卒以標金步下仍疲、最後價爲一千五百三十八元半、目前紗市、則其走勢三次未能穿出六百元關外、且雜牌紗價太低、加之外滙轉鬆、所以市盤不支而下、有人說恐見一千五百元左右、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市態本屬平常、但大業公司購進幾包、於是人心振盪、首盤開一千五百六十元、擯持多時、因大戶購進、從此大家高抬、場內籌碼稍緊、搶　子之流、即來收進、乃逐步升至一千五百七十一元、價格一高、不料標金續鬆、外滙放長、一霎間猛落十元、爲一千五百五十九元、此後消息不利、市情　續下降至一千五百四十六元收盤、查半日間成交統計一萬〇五百七十五包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<h3>棉市平凡</h3>
<p>現棉情況、隨紗市而淡泊、此因廠胃不展、二則近來到貨甚旺、存底較前充足、所以棉市平庸、加之外滙放長、紗市趨落、執貨者雖望高、然事實上已不可能矣、作共做開一千三百三十九件、價跌一二元、</p>

<p>紐約棉市、先因投機者買進而漲、續後又因南方幫售出略跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日約溝二二磅音、</p>
<p>印　棉市、先因散戶買進而漲、旋因各方套賣抑平、續後又因投機買進再漲、政府售出再跌、結果收盤價格漲三四羅比不等、</p>

<h3>美僑民意測騐結果　認上海可保中立　美縱參戰滬埠不受影響　日態度猶豫無開戰決心</h3>
<p>本埠某西報、最近所發起之美僑民意測騐、結果認在不久之將來、美國參戰、實爲不可避免之事、但上海一埠將不致受其影響、美僑一致贊成美陸長史汀生及民主黨議員披柏氏之演說、認爲此種言論、乃爲美國之一貫政策、蓋一般意見、認美國說已厠身於戰爭中也、</p>
<p>美日不致更趨緊張</p>
<p>據之江大學校長明思德博士稱、此種言論、無非使美國人民、了解現狀與應付現狀而已、一小部份美僑、認上海及中國沿海一帶、將受美國參戰之影響、大部份意見則不然、皆以爲美日關係不致更趨緊張、蓋美國將集中其注意力於大西洋、共現有之兩洋海軍、迄今尙未具有各個完備之實力、因之美國尙不願立即發動太平洋方面之戰爭</p>
<p>均認現狀　無須惶慮</p>
<p>在日本方面言、彼已一再對美施行威脅利誘手叚、然對美開戰問題、日本實尙猶豫未決也、一小部份美僑認爲美國之參戰、將使中國沿海一帶遭受封鎖、某一美領事館官員表示其個人之意見稱、此間美僑、現已無眞正之保障可資享受、因之認彼等之樂觀爲不可信、然史汀生氏等所發表之言論、並未寓有促令美僑立卽離華意、而此間大部份官員、皆謂對現狀無須惶慮、蓋彼等尙未接獲仟何驚人消息也、</p>
<p>上海中立　互受其益</p>
<p>一般美僑如名律師阿樂滿。前工部局總董樊克令。等、決留居此間、樊氏稱、上海將成爲中立區、而上海亦應保持此一中立地位、因上海一旦遭轟炸、對交戰國雙方、均無利益、如上海能守中立、則交戰國雙方之商業、當可繼彼維持也、</p>

<p>淸潔工人　服從勸吿</p>
<p>公董局方面認爲夏、令已屆、垃圾工人長此罷工、攸關界內衛生至鉅、乃與有關方面接洽、決定勸告先行復工、對於扣除上次罷工期內工資一節、局方允予照撥、並於昨晨七時、將被捕之工人五十五名、完全釋放、一面勸告工人先行復工、全體垃圾工人經此勸告後、遂於昨晨八時起、陸續開始復工、所有局方雇用替代工作之白俄工人二百餘名、於昨日午後實行解雇、工人復工後、當即驅車出發、淸除界內堆積垃圾、</p>

<h3>法公董局採辦越米　每月兩萬餘噸　各堆棧存米均不許出境　首批港米明日或可抵埠</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局、前爲防制偷運食米至外埠起見、曾一度通告、凡欲將食米運出公共租界、無論其爲傘米或洋米、須一律向江西路二〇九號該局辦公總處陳請發給通行證、非先領證、不得將食米運出公共租界、茲悉兩當局爲未雨綢繆計、對於已運本市米糧、無論堆國浦東虹口或中區、均不得自由轉運外埠、如經發覺、卽作偷運論、決依法究辦、而儆其餘、</p>
<p>週內米價　尙有跌風</p>
<p>公共租界當局、從香港運來之第一批米糧、計五千噸、可竿於星期六日抵此、以每石一百十元之代價發售、港米將到之消息、今（八日）晨使米價復跌五六元、共計四日來已跌三十五元以上、米糧投機份子、對租界當局所取行動、益感悼然、一般人堅信週內米價復將大跌、</p>
<p>法公董局　運米計劃</p>
<p>據今晨消息、法租界公董局從越南運米入滬之計劃、可於明日（九日）完成、法當局採運之越米數量若干、未能詳悉、惟衆信其數每月的二萬五千噸、與工部局運來之數相若、聞零售米店承銷第一批港米之籌備事宜、業已告竣、而市民可照工部局所定限制、直接購得港米、惟禁止轉售、以防投機份子從中漁利、</p>
<p>承銷港米　利潤優厚</p>
<p>此次廉價港米聞當局售給各米行之價格、爲每包一百二十二元九角一分、由米行售與米號、爲一百三十三元五角、計米行每包獲利達十元零五角九分、由米號售與市民、每石價格爲一百十元、計每包可獲利三元二角、較米號業公會議決之合法佣金每石爲二元、高一元二角、以米號如向米行訂購、每包重量如有不足、須由米行補給、米號如直接向立基洋行訂購、則最少額爲五百包、今全市大部份米行米號、以當局旣給以優厚之利潤、故咸樂與承銷、</p>
<p>各擋米價　繼續下跌</p>
<p>昨日米市開做後、因各米行競購當局所主辦之廉價港米、而各米號亦以港米扺滬在即、咸停止購辦、僅有少數存底空虛之米號、稍有購進、但總數亦僅四千餘包、至各檔米價、每石繼續下跌達五六元、西貢一號每石由一百三十八元跌至一百三十三元、小絞米由一百三十元跌至一百二十三四元、預計此種不合理之米價、必將繼續下跌至一百十元之合理價格，</p>
<p>外報推論　應付方針</p>
<p>本埠字林報、於上月二十七日首次發表攻擊上海一般黑心米蠹之社評後、昨日又發表一文、略謂、自工部局宜佈不久將可從香港運米來滬、以平價發售與本埠居民一消息後、近幾日來、米價已大見挫落、據最近出版之香港週報稱、囚食米價格扶搖直上、米價與市塲情形已脫離關係、上月十八日纔有百分之二十五碎米之西貢米、其批發價格、每担爲港幣十四元三角二分、合法幣僅六十八元、然上海市價、竟達法幣一百五十六元、以一担食米、竟可獲利八十八元之巨、此種交易、豈非於常理之外、故過去本埠一般人民、紛紛向當局陳述意見、然是時當局所擬對策耗費過大、或謂彼等無權處置、投機家更大展魔手、於是米市兪形混亂、日幾在跳十數元、一般居民咸感長此下去、勢非挺而走險不可、現在工部局因實行辦米計劃所耗金錢頗巨、此實不必要支出之增加、但亡羊補牢、猶未爲晚、一般認爲上海現正處於非常時期、當局應以非常之措置、對付一切問題、深望此後當局務弗拘泥過去之成規、各項問題、應出以迅速堅毅之手段處置之、</p>

<h3>工部局　特敎會發表報吿書（二）</h3>
<p>丁、通常敎育委員會在一九二二年間所提之報告書、戊、一九三一年敎育委員會所提之報告書及其建議逐步擴充之程序之採納、巳、一九三一年所定之進行程序、因財政上之困難、曾在一九三四年間、予以修改及限制、庚、一九三七年特別敎育委員會提出關於外僑學校之報告書、由於在開始經營公立學校以前時期之討論紀錄等、以爲以後按　提出之報告書中、可知形成局方敎育方針之基本原則、有下列數端、甲、適當敎育設備對於社會之極大利益、經充分認識與着重、乙、公立學校之各種使益、與私立學校之比較、曾予以注重、此點成爲工部局於一八九二年間、着　經營公立學校之決定因素、丙、以一整個社會之貢獻、設置公立學校、以利社會之一部份、而擯除其他部份、顯爲不公、於是遂有第一所華童公學於一九〇四年中間成立之事、以及一九三中間擬定逐步增設此類學校之龐大擴充計劃、</p>
<p>負担遞增</p>
<p>但在另一方面、初未計及敎育設備之唯一與普通責任付由工部局負之、以爲財政上之主要責任、應由學生家長食担、而工部局之原意、不過從事於開辦、組織與監督之必要措施、稍稍予以開辦之財政、援助而已、回溯工部局接手管理公立學校之時、估計每年經費、須由公款負担者、不過百分之二十五、而第一所　童公學成立之初、逆料在成立後一兩年內、經費當可自給、第以前項臆斷、均未實現、在一九一一年以前數年間、工部局曾負担公立學校之經費百分之五十、截至一九四〇年止、針育組織全部經費之比例、已增至百分之八　　、一九四一年度　尙須續</p>
<p>計劃减縮</p>
<p>查工部局對於敎育設施責任之宜有限制、已於一九一一年曁一九二二年委員會之報告書中、鄭重言之、沂年以還、因公立學校經費之遲增、於是主張紛紜、有議請採取「擴張主義者」之敎育方針者、另有人鑒於財政之困難事實、認爲此種辦法、將予整個社會以一過份苛重與不公平之負担、至於有利於前者之有力的理由、厥爲若干居民團體、並未由於令部敎育經費中、獲得均衡之利益、有欠公允、因此在一九三一年間決定設法在逐步增設華童學校之計劃中、糾正此種不平等情形、其時工部局因讓渡電氣部份之產業、經濟裕如、均前項擴充計劃、得以實施、泊乎一九三四年、局方重又發生經濟問題、於是有將此項計劃嚴加减縮之必要、施經決定全年敎育經費、不得超過等於總捐地稅證收率二厘之收入、同時議決暫時不再添設公立學校、</p>
<p>獎勵僑民</p>
<p>一九三七年討論西童學校之委員會、對於財政問題、重又考量、就經濟着想、同時使敎育經費之分配更臻公允起見、建議局方應擴充補助金辦法、獎勵僑民自設學校、嚴根限制以市政收入直接供給敎育設備、此外主張將公立學校兩所　歸僑民團體辦理、藉以减少公立學校之數目、</p>
<p>擬定方針</p>
<p>上文所討論者為歷史上之背景、良以本委員會擬定第一步工作、爲探求工部局與各國居民團體對於敎育方面所負責任之定義也、此項問題、業經縝密檢討、並作一致之見解如下、</p>
<p>甲·敎育設施、在整個社　福利之觀點上、係屬適切與需要的、此層工部局不能不加以注意、乙·現有工部局學校均維持高度效率、比僑民團體與獨立團體所支持之學校、至少同樣良好、或遠勝於彼、此外局立學校所樹立之標準、足資楷模、就政治理論而言、教育設施、係屬國家之責任、換言之、即屬於獨立自治而同種族之政治組織者、公共相界之自治權、係經各有關係國家之同意而獲得者、旣非一獨立之機構、又非一同種族之政治組織、職是之故、此項責仟、首應歸諸各國僑民團體、</p>
<p>復次、就實際上而論、對於一整個社會之學童、如欲直接實施一完全市政敎育、則限於經濟、責不可能、良以學童人數衆多、言語異殊、重以各國僑民團體間之文化與政治背景、又復不同、此種情形、使敎育設施、異於其他市政設施、如公共衛生、工務火政等等、蓋後者可具備一種單一而普通之設備、爲納稅人造福而不論其國籍也、以上種種、本委員會得一結論、即局方在敎育上之責任、應限於鼓勵與協助僑民團體之敎育組、並將直接市政敎育設施限於某種範圍、此種範圍、顯示由於若十具體理由（如任何團體之渺小·貧乏·以及缺乏組織等等）、捨直接敎育設施外、別無可以抉擇之途、此外工部局之責任、應限於若干特別敎育設備、如設置職業或技術練訓班等等、</p>
<p>本委員會茲經通過之議決案如下、「公共租界之敎育責任、第「屬於各國僑民團體、其次屬於工部局」、　（未完）</p>

<h3>孩子的命運　——在父母節前</h3>
<p>— 裴苓</p>
<p>廠裏人烟園吐出最後一次濃烟後，夕陽已失去了它的光輝，小金提着飯籃，急匆匆的跑出廠門，三步伸搶到別人面前，但被人拉住了：</p>
<p>「什麼事這樣急？你！」</p>
<p>「哦！對不起，哈哈，吿訴你，老婆要生了！」</p>
<p>「眞的？」</p>
<p>「誰編你？今天早晨我來的時候肚皮就有點痛，大槪此刻總要生了！」小金嘴角上還掛着大眞的笑。</p>
<p>「那麼，恭喜你，要做阿爸了，好福氣，哈哈！」帶着羨慕和打趣拍拍小金的肩膀。</p>
<p>「哈哈！」小金的臉上似乎每一塊肉都在笑。</p>
<p>很快地到了家裏剛進門，當一陣嬰孩的哭聲傳進他的耳鼓的時候，小金的心禁不住跳動起來，眞的做爸爸了。他感到一陣從未有過的快樂。</p>
<p>妻躺在床上呻吟着，頭上還汗涔涔的。孩子就睡在她旁邊，一張可愛的小面紫紅的　孔，黃黃的頭髮，小金覺得比任何的孩仔都　。</p>
<p>「男還是女？」他念切的問。</p>
<p>「兒子！」妻微笑着。</p>
<p>「眞的？」雖然明知道不會假。</p>
<p>「不過，金！我有幾句話同你說！」妻停了一會，仰起頭來：「我剛才想了半天，覺得只有走這條不得不走的路，米這樣貴，人眞難過，想養活一個孩子，眞難上加難，唉！這也不是事體，誰願　這樣呢？」</p>
<p>妻為多量的話疲倦了，喘了一回氣。</p>
<p>沉默</p>
<p>孩子睡熟了，肌肉一起一伏的波動；有時動一動身體，但立刻又睡熟了。</p>
<p>「那麼你說怎樣？」小金的顫抖的聲音劃破了沉寂。</p>
<p>「我說……怕你不願意，一定不願意，唉！誰願意呢？沒辦法呀！我說……——丟掉他！」</p>
<p>「什麼？丟掉他！像　電似的在破床前　攪動起來。</p>
<p>又是一個長時期的沉默。</p>
<p>「不能！」—斬鋼截鐵的聲音。</p>
<p>「不能？」妻苦笑一下：「你能養得起他麼？」</p>
<p>這使小金受了很重的一擊，剛才在路上種種快樂的幻想倐然毀滅，前面一片黑暗，他頹然的坐卜來，低了頭，好像小孩子　了責備似的。</p>
<p>——妻的話不錯，現在，合兩個人的工　還不够一個月的開銷，月都要負二三十元的債，怎麼能再加上一個孩子？再說，妻沒有好的食料，又怎麼　有奶水，還不是餓死！活活的餓死！兩個人日裏都去上工，誰看顧孩子？雇奶媽麼？呸！夢想！那裏有錢？</p>
<p>想到錢，他立刻又想到枕頭底下那一點僅有的財產，連買兩升米都不够，怎能養活一個孩子？</p>
<p>錢！孩子！米！奶水！錢</p>
<p>小金的頭腦昏了，看不見一切，他彷彿看見一個孩子被丟在野地裏，一羣野狗在聞着啃，手啃掉了，腿……頭……</p>
<p>孩子！那是他的孩子！</p>
<p>「我不能！」他突然站了起來。</p>
<p>「你仔細地想一想！」妻用懇求的語調說。</p>
<p>「唉！我不能想，……你好忍心，你忍必你的孩子被野狗啃嗎？」他提高了聲音。</p>
<p>「那沒有辦法！只怪他命不好，投到我們這窮人家來！唉！……」妻流下淚來，但立刻又揩去了：「金！聽我的話，去丟掉罷！與其眼看他活活地餓死，不如講他去罷，倒或者能得救！」最後一句她明知是安慰自己和小金的。</p>
<p>「難道我果眞就沒有福做父親麼？你也不讓你自己做母親麼？」小金呆望着孩子，孩子還在睡着。</p>
<p>「眞是孩子話！妻苦笑一下：「快點送出去罷！以後日子多哩！讓你做爸爸好了！」</p>
<p>「唉！孩子！你為什麼生到我家來！「他突然決心的抱起孩子，蹌蹌踉踉地走出去。</p>
<h3>枵腹唱空城</h3>
<p>— 星火作</p>
<h3>可憐？</h3>
<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>言有之：「上海之囤米奸商，毒如蛇蝎，貪如虎狼。」其實上海之囤米奸商也是挺「可憐」的。</p>
<p>可憐也分幾種：像活活餓死：像生不如死；像活「不起」死不得……但我們的囤米奸商却要被「可憐」過這等人千萬倍，為什麼？因為世界上最可憐的原是「至死不悟」者！</p>
<p>而且，「你們」又不了解「我們」啊！</p>
<p>譬如工部局託銷　米。好好一篇「再託行商轉手，徒增成本，不若由米號直接購銷，庶食戶多受實惠：」的「堂皇嘉言」，而大家却目為喪盡天良之辭，天下還有比這更「可憐」的事嗎？</p>
<p>無人「了解」，至死不悟，因此「米蛀蟲」就變十足的「可憐蟲」！</p>
<p>但可憐嗎？牠們終究是「蟲」，還是「死有餘辜」的。</p>
<h3>秋海堂</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（七）臉上劃一個十字</p>
<p>「老七，別這樣暴燥！」胡督軍的來意，原是應着紹文的要求，想給秋海棠說情的，不料秋海棠已給他們這樣殘忍的傷害了，而紹文的狂怒，已到了立刻要和他叔父火併的地步，他便不得不一變而為反替袁賓藩說情了。「這件事，倫理的確是老兄弟你太魯莽了！你把他這樣毀了，豈不比死還要難受？」</p>
<p>袁賓藩倒也想不到他這一個姪兒竟會如此狂怒起來，而且他不能忘記自己從小那樣的胡鬧，敗盡家產，幾次險些一餓死，都是他大奇周　了；他後來他從小兵當起，潛漸得意了，大哥也在政界裏變了紅人，又一再替他說情，替他拉攏，使他步步高升起來，一直到大哥死，也沒有報答過他。所以他對於　文，平良心說，不能不特別厚待幾分；何况這幾年來，紹文那一件事不替他赤心赤胆的幹？</p>
<p>「三哥，可惜你們來得太遲了一些，我現在要懊悔也來不及了！」他破例的用着很和軟的聲音說：「但是，三哥老七你們總也不願意我當忘八嗎？」</p>
<p>「奴才的話你怎麼——！」紹文依舊怒不可遏地說。</p>
<p>「可是他見了那個啞了頭的屍首，就立刻昏了過去這可不是奴才們所說的啊？並且他自己後來也跟我破了臉，當看這些人完全承認了。」他把右手向旁邊那些下人一指。「老七，好孩子，我當一個鎮守使也不能不要一些臉皮啊？不信你可以問他們！」</p>
<p>紹文的忿火，這才略略降低了一些。</p>
<p>「人沒有死嗎？」胡督軍回頭去向失了知覺的秋海棠看了一眼，不很關切地問。</p>
<p>「沒有。」</p>
<p>紹文却不曾注意他們的問答。（一〇一）</p>
<h3>「靠天吃飯」的一羣</h3>
<p>— 鍾肯</p>
<p>中國人對於「吃飯」兩字的解釋，實在是很奇特的。譬如「吃洋行飯」「吃開口飯」「吃白相飯」之類，往往是當作「職業」的代名詞的。而「靠天吃飯」也不過是那種代名詞的「之一」罷了。</p>
<p>老婆婆之類，持唸佛珠，吃觀音素，固然也自名是「靠天吃飯」。然而，那畢竟當不得眞的。他們「吃」的實在還是她兒子或丈夫的「飯」，而且，唸佛到底還不是她們的職業。我想，眞的「靠天」來「吃飯」的羣，恐怕是沒有像先　的安穩了。</p>
<p>前兩天，走過一個不知什麼「寺」，固然，裏面還燈燭輝煌，但生意似乎是很淸淡。和尚們沒精打采的唸着佛號，一點也沒有在年肥頭大耳的樣子了。以　在報上看到，和尚們曾要求增加「經費」，可見這口「靠天吃飯」實在是很難吃下去了。眞的，除了－些暴發戶之外，普通人在一百四五十元一石白米的高壓下，那裏還能再照顧他們呢。比孫行者一跳十萬八十里還要漲得快的米價，恐怕連懸在中堂的「佛法無邊」的橫匾也要黯然失色了吧！</p>
<p>馬路上，還時常可以看得到扶着孩子的　命瞎子。用一片鋼條互　着，還喊：「流年大運，月令偏財！」然而往往轉了一二個衖堂，立刻又出來了。這年頭，誰還留着替自己一算算命」的念頭呢。我想，假使那餓得乾癟的瞎子，曾替自己「算算命」的話，恐怕早該跳黃浦了。</p>
<p>也有坐在馬路一角的瞎子，拚命把籤筒搖得康郎康郎地響，急得連汗也從那沒有眼珠的眼眶裏流了出來，還是沒有人理睬他。……</p>
<p>懂得「奮鬥神術」的「一塵子」之流，雖然也還嚕囌地拉住路人訴說他的氣色不　，要用「法」來解一解。但那有人肯掏出腰包來，祗好讓那些呌化子也似的神仙」，獨自嘆氣。</p>
<p>星相家用大張紅紙招兒寫着貼在門口，說是「大刦之年」。然而，沒人顧會。他假使夜觀天象，首先還得替自己嘆吧。</p>
<p>眞的，「天」也快坍了。供養菩薩的香火也慢慢的少了下來。那裏還顧得到「靠大吃飯」的一羣呵。</p>
<h3>筆花</h3>
<p>— 君瑞</p>
<p>凡是前進的人，都是善於了解自己時代需要的人。</p>
<p>幸災樂禍的人，是世間最冷淡，最殘酷，最醜忠的人。</p>
<p>逃避人生的人，是最懦弱無用的人。</p>
<p>「誠實」是獲得別人信仰的法寶，我們應該謹慎地使用它。</p>
<p>要生活便要鬥爭，不要忘記我們每天都在鬥爭之中。</p>
<p>榨取他人的勞動和幸福，而自已坐享其成，這是最可恥的行為。</p>
<p>在工作中找求快樂，體會人生。</p>
<p>無計劃的熱心，如摸索於黑暗之間。</p>
<p>盡你的力量，做完你一天中所應該做的工作。</p>

<h3>瑙瑪希拉將息影銀壇</h3>
<p>— 映榴</p>
<p>一代悲劇藝人</p>
<p>影城以飾演悲劇主角而聞名的瑙瑪希拉，自一九二五年九月正式隸屬於米高梅旗幟之下後，屈指已達十六年之久，先後主演影片計有六十餘部之多，尤以「閨怨」「鑄情」「絕代艷后」「女人」等數片最受國內外觀衆所擁戴，一九三五年六月，共丈夫不幸患肓腸炎逝世後，瑙瑪因感身世遭遇之凄凉，即擬向公司當局引退，後携同幼女遷回故鄕朗勃雪洲休養，嗣因該公司新任副經理却雨鮑克堅決挽留，始行繼續與公司簽訂合同六年，當時瑙瑪木人爲表示獻身藝壇，純係造就個人之藝術爲宗旨起見，即聲明不願增加週薪及年終一切酬勞等費，公司當局對瑙瑪所提出之善意條件，當表樂予接受，且過去瑙瑪本人每年年終應得之巨額獎金均山其親自分別支配後，掃數捐贈慈善機關應用，故好萊塢一般人士，對瑙瑪之忠誠服務及熱心於社會，均表深切之同情。因此不久即被譽爲「銀國賢婦人」的雅號。</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉現有一女年僅十二齡，自身弱多病，四年前在鞦韆架嬉戲時，不幸失足墮下而使踝骨折斷，迄今猶未復原，瑙瑪木愛之如掌珠，自折斷踝骨事發生後，益加愛護，朝夕不離，每决瑙瑪上攝影塲上拍戲時，必有二女僕携同其女隨侍看護，誠恐再遭不測，且每日課讀亦由瑙瑪親自在家敎授，不使再往學校。另聞瑙瑪後母所生之一妹，名瓊克希拉，於最近亦已加入米高梅公司充任演員，曾在「血淚相思」一片中初露頭角，演技亦不弱，且面部與瑙瑪同樣有淸晰之黑斑數點，甚爲注目。據悉最近瑙瑪領銜主演之「淚灑玉蝶」一片中，亦由其妹協助演出，成續益見進展，故瑙瑪曾向公司中人云：「余已超出上攝影塲上之年齡，故對銀壇生活確可告一結束，以免被觀衆所淘汰，嗣後祇願公司當局，對余妹厚意栽培，實爲本人之願望。」現公司當局曾表示可予完全接受，對其妹將優予提拔，以報答瑙瑪十餘年來對公司之赤心服務矣。</p>
<p>瑙瑪與公司所訂之六年合同，至木年八月中句即告期滿，故前月瑙瑪即親自向公司告退，公司當局對瑙瑪之引退，雖表示異常婉惜，然在事實上知已無法挽留，故已允予接受，公司並照章發給酬勞金七年，因此目前瑙瑪所主演之「淚灑玉蝶」「鶼蝶恨」二片，已決定提前趕攝完全，從此在銀幕上，將不復再見此悲角之艷影矣。</p>

<p>平劇是徽漢崑蛻化而成，紹興戲（不是的篤班冒名的紹興文戲）是餘姚溫州南戲的遺音，平劇在平盛極一時是在同光之間，南戲發源在南宋苟安於杭州以後，考歷史是紹興戲比平劇更悠久；不過平劇經過內庭供奉，士大夫沉迷，去蕪存精，刪粗增華，形式上已脫去了微漢崑的原則，實質裹失去了戲劇潛移默化，正風易俗本能，變成了消閒的物事，悅耳目，暢心胸的弄戲了。紹興世風古樸，民性勤儉，所以紹興戲到現在還脫不了鄕風土氣。大戲（武戲）多演忠烈，小戲（文戲）描寫貞節，和平劇以敘事爲主不着中心的如空城計，烏盆計，捉放曹，定軍山，盜宗卷，壩陵橋，古城會，長板坡，惡虎村，界牌關，小上墳，拾玉鐲，貴妃醉酒，祭塔，丑表功，拾黃金，黑風帕，探陰山，打龍袍不同，自徽班勢力入浙東以後，紹興戲就漸漸歸於淘汰。一般後起伶人爲迎合人心起見，兼採徽本而演之，如龍虎鬬，高平關，湧金門，界牌關，楊家將，長板坡，借趙雲等都是的。其實紹興戲組織小比平劇單陋，班規戲例都較平劇嚴格，平劇武生又兼演武凈戲，强稱武生　臉戲，老生可以唱花臉戲，如珠簾寨李克用，斬經堂吳漢，斬黃袍趙匡胤，紹興戲素面脚色與開臉角兒，以性情爲界，沙陀國李克　，渭水河姜太公都是凈扮，吳漢　直忠義也用凈扮，趙匡胤借頭（高平關）斬鄭（斬黃袍）一藏奸計，一迷女色，所以派凈扮。包公是文官，不比姚期是武將出身，紹興戲班定例，由老牛飾，不過紹興戲封建色彩太重，如龍虎鬬之呼延贊，爲一孝子，牠却用小丑扮，因爲他在是劇中是罵主伐君的。（平劇用凈飾）</p>
<p>總而言之，紹興戲食古不化，是牠壞處；平劇處處唯新，也是不好現象，何况每一齣戲，有寄托的太少，則紹興戲之演出，自比平劇爲合理了</p>

<p>然而又有一事使他心裹更是忐忑因爲何姬常差小婢到他房中來送食物與他吃，頗見殷勤，他反而不安起來了。有天正是十五夜明月半牆花影班駁，黃昏時，許靖在客室中燈下觀書，房門虛掩着，忽聽門外綷　之聲，他心裏一楞。跟着房門輕輕推開了，走　一個麗人來，峨峨高髻，白白粉臉，穿着嫩綠色的雲裳，金蓮窄窄，織不盈握，含情却立，凝睇　視，一陣非蘭非麝的杳氣撲人鼻官，正是何姬。許靖驚愕之餘，站起相迎。何姬也不待他招呼，走至他的書桌傍椅子裏坐下，帶着笑對許靖說道：「今晚老頭兒又是戒期，在外獨宿，不到我房中去的。一人獨坐，想起公子覊旅他鄕。未免寂寞無聊，有誰來憐惜你呢？所以不避嫌疑，到你處來談談，不知你心中以爲如何」？許靖聽了，連忙說道：「多謝美意，祇是我孤零慣的，一人獨居，淸靜不煩，正可用心讀書。何姬不等他說完，早搶着說道：「古人說得好，書中自有顏如玉，公子難道想得顏如玉嗎？可是眼前也有顏如玉，何必到書中去求呢」？許靖聽何姬說的　，越發見得伊有意挑返。誰知落花有意，流水無情，自己是一個堂堂奇男子，怎肯幹這種禽獸的行爲？伊可說沒有眸子了！遂又說道：「我許靖虛度二十餘春秋，却不懂得什麽顏如玉，顏如鐵，惟知竭我所能，貢獻於國，希望六得功業，不負此生，姬夫人又何必如此說呢」？何姬見他甚是嚴粛，父笑了一笑道：「我不信世上竟有不知情的男子，像你這般少年，端的可愛，但你小要在我面前　做道學君子，反要令我笑你生得獃了！我的心你可知道嗎」？那個老頭兒，你不要怕他，他決不曾知道的。我和你　圖歡樂，別辜負了我的深情」。說着詁，站起嬌軀，挨至許靖身邊來，仲出軟綿綿的柔英，來和許靖握手。許靖勃然　色。此　他也顧不得什麽得罪不得罪了，右臂一起，把何姬的手格在一邊，立起身來說道：「這成什麽樣了？我早說過許靖是堂堂正正的奇男子，斷不肯做禽獸之行。千萬請你自己珍重。羞忠之心，人皆有之，寡康鮮恥，人中之妖，請你快快回去，保全你的顏面，吾則我就要去禀告伯父了」。（五八）</p>

<h3>War Atmosphere Permeates Washington; U.S. Navy on Standby for Convoy Duty; Fleet to be Distributed Evenly Across Both Oceans as Usual; Willkie Speech Calls for Substantial Aid to Britain</h3>
<p>Washington – The convoy issue erupted again in Congress yesterday, filling the capital with a war atmosphere, awaiting President Roosevelt's next steps in the "Battle of the Atlantic." The current situation includes: (1) The House passed a bill authorizing the President to use 100 foreign ships; (2) Navy Secretary Colonel Knox announced the Navy Department's reclaiming of the overseas activities of the U.S. Coast Guard; (3) Colonel Knox stated that Britain has made a general request to increase naval power by 115 small vessels. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington – Republican Senator Vandenberg of Michigan publicly released a letter from Rear Admiral Land, Chairman of the U.S. Maritime Commission, yesterday, refuting rumors that 40% of U.S. aid to Britain was being sunk in the Atlantic. Rear Admiral Land stated that of the 205 ships carrying raw materials to Britain, only eight were sunk between December 30th and April 30th. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington – Former Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Pratt has recently been recalled to duty. It is said that all or part of the Pacific Fleet can be deployed to the Atlantic within two weeks without prior preparation. It is also said that the Navy Department may restore the practice of evenly distributing the U.S. fleet across both oceans. (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington – Navy Secretary Colonel Knox stated that the Navy is prepared to carry out the U.S. convoy duties urged by Army Secretary Colonel Stimson on Tuesday. He also stated that the maritime activities of the U.S. Coast Guard have been integrated into the Navy. Meanwhile, Washington is strongly debating Stimson's proposal for the Navy to fully support Britain. Knox delivered a speech on the evening of the 7th (morning of the 8th, Shanghai time), and it is widely believed that his advocacy of convoy support to Britain is on par with, and perhaps surpasses, that of Colonel Stimson. Colonel Knox also stated that the order to transfer Coast Guard activities to the Navy Department was signed by President Roosevelt. This move includes major vessels but does not include aircraft activities. According to Navy orders, the vessels will be manned by the Coast Guard. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – Navy Secretary Colonel Knox criticized Stimson's broadcast speech yesterday, saying that he considered it "a brave and straightforward enlightening talk, inspired by high patriotism." (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>U.S. Resolves to Use Vast Resources to Safeguard British Naval Power; Important Speech by Colonel Knox</p>
<p>Washington – Navy Secretary Colonel Knox declared last night that all of America's vast resources, including manpower, are being used for a supreme purpose: to ensure that the British naval power, which has protected us in the Atlantic for a century, is not destroyed by a nation that we openly recognize as our enemy. Knox also warned that if this shipping lane is not maintained, the United States will face a disaster. If that happens, we will face a naval power infinitely superior to our own. At that time, we will have to defend the entire Western Hemisphere with only the U.S. fleet and fight against the superior navies of Germany, Italy, and France. Knox pointed out that the United States must be able to control both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans as a guarantee for America. He added that the United States' ability to control these two oceans in the past has largely been due to the strength of its ally, Britain. One of the factors that has allowed us to develop to our current state is the deadly danger, and the current threat to the British Navy is also our danger. Once British naval power in the Atlantic is destroyed, danger will come, and perhaps none of the men and women listening to my speech today will be able to avoid it. And this danger will be far greater than you can imagine. That is why some people familiar with the situation attach particular importance to this danger, and it is why the United States is mobilizing all of its vast financial, material, trade, manpower, and production resources for a supreme purpose. Knox delivered this speech at a conference of book publishers. British Ambassador Halifax also gave a speech, but he did not mention the international situation. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>New York – Republican leader Willkie called for less talk and more action on the issue of aid to Britain yesterday. Speaking at a meeting in Madison Square Garden, he said, "We love peace deeply, but we cannot close our eyes to all the arduous struggles around us. However, if we only shout about peace but fail to achieve it, and the arduous struggle has already reached our doorstep, we can no longer close our eyes. Because the only free nation in Europe has also been defeated, the most important thing now is to safely transport the increased output of American factories to Britain. In this way, Britain can not only sustain its nation but also achieve victory. I don't want to talk too much or shout popular terms. At the same time, whether we advocate using naval escorts, patrols, or air cover, or even transporting everything to Britain at once, we must do less talking and more action." (United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Plans to Increase Magnesium and Aluminum Production; Massive Manufacturing of Bombers; Automobile Production to be Suspended</h3>
<p>Washington – Defense officials here said yesterday that U.S. automobile production may be temporarily suspended to increase aircraft production. Magnesium and aluminum production, which are necessary for manufacturing bombers, will be greatly increased. It is reported that the plan is to produce 125,000,000 pounds of aluminum per month, more than the 25,000,000 pounds in February and the 50,000,000 pounds in April. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>House Authorizes President to Requisition 100 Foreign Merchant Ships</p>
<p>128 German Sailors Detained</p>
<p>Washington – The House passed a bill authorizing President Roosevelt to take over 100 merchant ships from Germany, Italy, and occupied countries by a vote of 266 to 120, and the bill has been sent to the Senate. The bill stipulates that compensation for the requisitioned ships will be offset against the war debts owed to the United States by the countries concerned. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington – The House passed a bill yesterday authorizing President Roosevelt to requisition foreign ships idle in U.S. ports for defense purposes. The bill has been sent to the Senate. Eighty-three foreign ships are eligible for this bill, including two German ships and twenty-eight Italian ships. The bill expires on June 30, 1942. The purchase and lease of foreign ships will be conducted by the Maritime Commission. At the same time, the twenty-eight Axis-country ships under surveillance are continuing to be repaired. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>New York – One hundred and twenty-eight German sailors on Ellis Island have been detained, as the U.S. government is preventing Fifth Column activities. FBI agents are currently searching for other German sailors. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington – Mr. Chab, director of the New York branch of the Sea News Agency, and his assistant, Mr. Thorne, were arrested on March 11 for violating the registration law and were released on bail. They have now been arrested in New York by Justice Department secret agents and handed over to the local Justice Department officials for detention. They will not be released on bail until a decision on their deportation is made. The reason for their detention is that one person changed his status, as both entered the U.S. under a business agreement according to current commercial treaties. It is also heard that Italian sailors in U.S. ports will also be arrested. (International News, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. President Issues Order; Foreign Goods in Transit Subject to Export License Control</h3>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt has issued an executive order stipulating that goods in transit through the United States are subject to export licensing control. It is believed that this measure is a further step by the President to close loopholes in the supply of goods to Axis or pro-Axis countries, and to restrict the transit of South American goods through U.S. ports to other countries, including Japan. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt signed an order requiring all foreign goods passing through U.S. territory or being transshipped to obtain export licenses if they are on the embargo list. This order also applies to the Panama Canal and duty-free transshipment ports. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington – Agriculture Secretary Wickard announced yesterday the establishment of a joint British-U.S. committee to expedite the procurement of food for shipment to Britain under the provisions of the Lend-Lease Act. The committee has three British and three U.S. members, with Wickard as chairman. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. House Naval Affairs Committee Approves Huge Appropriations; To Strengthen Defenses in Guam and Other Locations; Expand Equipment of the Coast Guard</h3>
<p>Washington – The House Naval Affairs Committee approved a major appropriation of approximately $57,750,000 for eleven major seaplane bases and other supporting facilities. The House Appropriations Committee also sympathetically read an emergency supplementary bill of $173,749,630, including the establishment of Coast Guard matters on Guam and Samoa, and a fund for the construction of ship locations in Honolulu. The bill also provides $2,390,000 for the Coast Guard to add navigation aids, including $108,000 for Guam. (United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>Manila – The U.S. Army transport ship Washington arrived here today, the second reinforcement of Philippine troops in a few weeks. Army officials declined to comment, but it is reported that 2,000 soldiers and several aircraft arrived. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Manila – Philippine President Quezon is planning to send Finance Minister Roxas to Washington to borrow US$200 million from the Export-Import Bank to adjust the Philippine government's allocation of coconut kernels, alcohol, and sugar. (United Press, 8th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>American Convoy and Japan</h3>
<p>Regarding the recent future of the Far Eastern situation, yesterday's editorial explained that while the current situation appears calm, it still conceals underlying dangers. Its development depends on the overall international changes. The so-called "overall international" is not singular but plural, making it difficult to choose any single aspect as the linchpin or sole focus. These changes may be indicated by signs or traced by clues, but both are uncertain. The outcome of multifaceted turbulence and twists cannot be determined by a fixed formula. Even instigators find it difficult to control outcomes beforehand. Japan, having meticulously initiated its aggression against China, believed it could take whatever it wanted. However, China has dragged it down for four years. Now, Japan is forced to set a goal of resolving the "China Incident," envisioning an ideal state, but in reality, it wants to stop but cannot. Similarly, the Axis powers in Europe, initially achieving planned and overwhelming victories, suffered a setback in the Balkans, necessitating military intervention. To date, they have been unable to launch a direct attack on Britain. Furthermore, the signing of the Tripartite Pact aimed to promote the so-called New Order and sway all nations. However, the picture of the New Order is only drawn within the scope of their military occupation. Local developments have often gone against their wishes, so how can the overall international changes be grasped? Past episodes have been unexpected, so how can future ripples be predicted? Ultimately, success or failure is determined by an irresistible iron rule. The progress of human civilization will follow the Earth's revolution and rotation, never reversing. However, the accompanying storms and rains are constantly changing, creating a kaleidoscope of phenomena.</p>
<p>In the Far East, Japan is trying to sell its storms and rains. According to a Tokyo dispatch yesterday, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated that when Matsuoka visited Berlin, the German side never requested Japan's assistance in the European war. This creates a completely different facade from what was agreed upon in Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact. It also expressed a seemingly fearless view that American aid would not be enough to save Britain. However, it failed to explain or conceal why Germany was enraged by American aid to Britain. The spokesperson vaguely stated that if the Axis powers were attacked, Japan would be forced to fulfill its obligations, leading to an unexpected Japanese-American war. This implied a willingness to take military action against the U.S. However, what he called "unexpected" is precisely what he fears the most. In short, Japan is hinting at its ambiguous relationship with the Tripartite Pact, which can be true or false. At the same time, it is holding up the paper treaty, hoping to sell it for a good price. On one hand, it curses and condemns Britain's inevitable defeat and praises Germany's inevitable victory, fulfilling its duty as an ally. On the other hand, it is acting aggressively, but in reality, it only wants to use this as a bargaining chip to support those in the U.S. who oppose the convoy plan in preparation for the U.S.'s armed convoy. It is true that the U.S.'s aid in military supplies and equipment to democratic countries has great significance. However, it is crucial that we have the U.S. escort this aid to the war zones. The significance of aid lies in doing one's best. The significance of convoy duty lies not only in doing one's best but also in seeking objective effectiveness for friendly countries. This means taking on a thorough belief and responsibility for one's own efforts. Originally, the convoy method certainly had its possible most serious reactions and had certainly undergone the most serious considerations by the U.S. authorities. From what Army Secretary Stimson and Navy Secretary Knox have expressed, it is clear that no matter how serious the reactions to the convoy are, the U.S. authorities have made up their minds to implement the convoy regardless of the reactions. The remaining issues for the U.S. are the maturity of public opinion and the question of timing. This influences the invading countries: If the U.S. only supplies military weapons and equipment, then they will recklessly target military weapons and equipment for attack. If the U.S. implements convoy duty, then should we target the U.S. convoy even more? Should we target the U.S. that is providing the convoy? The invading countries cannot help but seriously reconsider from the beginning.</p>
<p>Convoy duty reaches Britain first, and the impact reaches Germany and Italy first. However, based on observations, the invading country that feels most hesitant about this is Japan, even more than Germany and Italy. Although both Germany and Italy want the U.S. to isolate itself from the war vortex, in reality, Germany and Italy no longer expect anything from the U.S. and have already disregarded it. Therefore, if the U.S. implements convoy duty, Germany and Italy will most likely try to exploit loopholes to engage in attacks while avoiding a direct major conflict with the U.S. However, they will not hesitate or refuse a conflict. As for Japan, it knows that Germany and Italy will inevitably conflict with the U.S. because of Germany and Italy's attacks on the American convoy. This presents Japan with an issue it can no longer evade: If Germany and Italy clash with the U.S., how should the Tripartite Pact be interpreted? Should we go to war against the U.S. based on our treaty obligations? This is Japan's unique hesitation, and Japan's decision after hesitation is closely related to the Far Eastern situation.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles in the Counteroffensive on Zhuji; Zhejiang Chinese Troops Advance on All Fronts; Once Captured Fuyang on the North Bank of the Qiantang River; Japanese Troops Retreat from Southern Anhui to Jiulishan</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Military news: (1) The Chinese troops counterattacking Zhuji are advancing very rapidly. On the morning of the 6th, after crossing the line of Jieting Wangjiajing Chencaota outside the city, they continued to capture Phoenix City (10 kilometers east of Zhuji) and other places. In the afternoon, the Japanese army sent a large number of reinforcements and bombed with more than ten aircraft. The Chinese troops fought valiantly. By 5 p.m., more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers had been killed, and the Japanese retreated towards Zhuji city. (2) On the north bank of the Qiantang River, Chinese troops attacked Fuyang city on the evening of the 5th and once entered the city, killing many Japanese soldiers and capturing several Japanese soldiers alive. All Japanese warehouses and barracks were destroyed. (3) The Japanese troops who retreated from Wanzhi's Nanguan Shengdian were defeated by the Chinese troops on the 5th. The Japanese retreated to Jiulishan, and the Chinese troops pursued them, continuing to gain victories. The situation has now returned to what it was three days ago. (4) The Japanese troops in Yingshan, northern Hubei, gathered a large force of about 10,000 men and advanced in several directions towards the northwest. One force of more than 1,000 men invaded Wu Fang on the 5th and advanced towards Yinjiamiao, engaging in fierce fighting with a Chinese troop unit near Baimiaoshi. Another force of more than 1,000 men advanced from Wanjiadian towards Gaocheng. Chinese troops are resisting. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Military news: The Chinese troops counterattacking Zhuji yesterday completed their deployment and began attacking the Japanese army. All forces adopted fierce attacks. The main force has crossed Wachen Jieting Hengshan and other places and is attacking towards the Zhuji urban area. The Chinese troops north of Pai Tou Town are also advancing towards Zhuji along the railway line and the Puyang River. Progress has been made on all fronts. By last night, they had reached the southeastern suburbs of Zhuji and launched a battle for control. After the Japanese troops in Linhai, eastern Zhejiang, boarded ships, there was no trace of the Japanese along the coast. The Japanese troops in Zhuji city, located on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, are trapped and in a dilemma. The Chinese troops have now recovered all surrounding strongholds and are surrounding Zhuji, launching fierce attacks. The elite Chinese troops in the Twelfth Capital are advancing eastward in a roundabout way, cutting off the Japanese retreat route and launching a three-pronged attack. Zhuji can be taken within a few days. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman told visiting reporters this afternoon that the battles in the mountains near the border of Henan and Hubei provinces are still in their initial stages. The situation should be clear in about a week. Since the Japanese army moved from Xinyang and Suixian on May 1, the central route also began operations from Yingshan on May 5. Although the Japanese army has only dispatched a small number of troops to the northwest, it is believed that the Japanese army has now assembled 10,000 troops in the area, so it is believed that the Japanese army will have new activities in the area. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Guangdong Chinese Troops Capture Jiazigang</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese troops in eastern Guangdong launched a counterattack against the Japanese troops in the Jiazigang area. On the evening of the 3rd, they cleared out the Japanese troops near the northeast port of Jiazigang. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and advanced rapidly, recapturing Jiazigang and various strongholds in the urban area on the afternoon of the 4th at 1 p.m. The Japanese troops boarded ships and retreated. The Chinese troops seized a large amount of supplies. Order has now been restored in Jiazigang. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Central and Northern China; Japanese Take Offensive</p>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman announced today that the Japanese army has once again begun "cleansing" operations in central and northern China. The purpose of the offensive in northern China is to cross the Yellow River. 20,000 Japanese troops are advancing from Xinyang (transliterated) in the Henan border area, and from Yingshan and Suixian in northern Hubei. It is clear that they are trying to break through the Chinese fortress of Dongpo (transliterated) along the mountains of the Hubei-Henan border. The spokesman said that there are two Japanese divisions in northern China that began a new attack two days ago on the base of the Chinese army in Zhongtiaoshan. If the Japanese army is victorious, it may cross the Yellow River. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>U.S. to Aid China with Aircraft</p>
<p>Chongqing – The possibility of the United States aiding China with aircraft has attracted sudden attention from the public and private sectors today. The Army Organ Sweeping Report declared that according to recent news, the United States will provide China with 400 aircraft, including 30 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses. The newspaper also published a long article detailing the mechanical structure of the Flying Fortress. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Yunnan</h3>
<p>Kunming – This afternoon, 18 Japanese bombers invaded Yunnan Province and attacked Mengzi and its surrounding targets. Between noon and 4 p.m., there were air raid alerts in Kunming. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of Re-Blocking the Burma Road are All Rumors</h3>
<p>Chongqing – British authorities here will likely issue a solemn denial of rumors that the British side, as a result of Japanese threats, intends to re-block the Burma Road. The origin of this rumor is that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie met with Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi. Reuters has learned that this conversation had nothing to do with the Burma Road. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Sino-British-U.S. Cooperation Will Soon Become Closer; Central Daily News Advocates that the Three Countries Should Form an Alliance</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Well-informed political circles declared today that China's foreign policy hereafter, under the planning of the new Foreign Minister Dr. Guo Taiqi, will cooperate more closely with Britain and the United States. At the same time, the official Central Daily News advocated cooperating more closely with democratic countries and taking a proactive role in international affairs. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Daily News published an article advocating that the three democratic countries, China, Britain, and the United States, should form an alliance, stating that the United States has become the central force in the camp of democratic countries, with Britain as its left wing and China as its right wing. The success or failure of each wing affects the entire camp. The Axis countries, Germany, Italy, and Japan, have already signed the Tripartite Pact and formed an alliance. In the past, democratic countries were unable to take this step for various reasons, and some elements insisted that peace could be achieved through compromise. The British and French governments once believed that Italy could be persuaded to stay out of the war. Before the signing of the Tripartite Pact, some elements in democratic countries, Liu Yuandong believed that they could persuade Japan to stay out of the Axis. The repeated failures of appeasement have made Britain and the United States realize that this policy cannot be continued. Today, if there are still people who believe that they can induce Japan to postpone its southward advance through compromise and appeasement, they will repeat the mistakes of the past. We firmly believe that Britain's victory and China's victory are equally important to China's struggle to fight for freedom and independence. We hope that the British government and all sectors of British society will understand the importance of China's resistance and not harbor hopes of appeasement or fear taking any actions that may promote Japan's southward advance. Today, Britain, the United States, and China have the same goals and all know the necessity of mutual cooperation. We sincerely hope that they can formulate a definite plan to cope with any eventuality, so that the invading countries do not take the initiative, so that they do not create new opportunities and regions for new aggression and expansion.

<h3>Wang Zhengting Arrives in Guiyang from Chongqing</h3>
<p>Guiyang – Wang Zhengting, President of the China Red Cross Society, arrived in Guiyang today from Chongqing. He is scheduled to inspect the headquarters of the Society's rescue team and the Guiyang branch tomorrow. Mr. Wang represented our country at the Paris Peace Conference at the end of the First World War. This time, his visit to Guiyang coincides with the "May Ninth" commemoration. At the request of the General Assembly, he will give a lecture. He plans to leave Guiyang on the 10th and travel to Hong Kong for official business. (Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>New Banks Open in Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The banking industry in Chongqing has recently become very developed. There are currently 30 member banks of the Bankers Association, and 8 or 9 non-member banks. There are many more new establishments. The banks that have already opened include the Jian Guo Bank. Those in preparation include the County Township Bank Headquarters, the Yangtze River Industrial Bank, the Fuxing Industrial Bank, the Social Welfare Bank, the Chengdu Commercial Bank Branch, and the Civic Bank. In addition, there are also quite a few newly established silver firms. This proves that finance in the Chinese rear is active and reflects the rapid progress of various constructions.

<h3>British House of Commons Ends Debate, Passes Vote of Confidence in Government, Prime Minister Churchill Reports on War Situation, 500,000 Troops Defend the Middle East</h3>
<p>London – Prime Minister Churchill, in a tumultuous parliamentary debate yesterday, reportedly engaged in a war of words with his accusers. He asserted that Britain was determined to defend the Middle East to the death, winning a vote of confidence from Parliament. He stated that the loss of the Nile Valley, the Suez Canal, and Malta would be an unbearable blow, but Britain was determined to defend them with all the resources of the British Empire and had good reason to believe it would succeed. He added that there should be no rash or pessimistic talk of reducing losses in the Middle East. He then ridiculed former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha’s criticism of the government for producing too few tanks, saying that Hore-Belisha, now out of government, had only gained this foresight recently. Hore-Belisha rose in anger, causing an uproar in the chamber, but was drowned out by the din before he could finish his sentence. Finally, the House of Commons passed a vote of confidence, following the House of Lords' vote of confidence the previous day, demonstrating Parliament's united support for the government's war effort. (8th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – The British House of Commons resumed debate yesterday, resulting in a vote of 447 to 3 in favor of the government's motion of confidence.</p>
<p>Lloyd George’s Ardent Speech</p>
<p>In yesterday’s debate, former Prime Minister Lloyd George spoke first, quite passionately, saying in brief that everyone supports the government's motion of confidence, but the government's wartime administration has indeed been disappointing and unsatisfactory in certain respects. He praised Foreign Secretary Eden and Turkey's loyalty, but questioned why no mention was made of Turkey allowing German ships to pass through the Bosphorus Strait and into the Dardanelles to seize a Greek island. The government should provide more information to Parliament. Britain is not a naive country and has overcome many difficulties. It will not panic even upon hearing unfavorable news. The remarks of U.S. Secretary of War Stimson are heartening, indicating that the United States understands the seriousness of the situation. However, Britain should not have extravagant expectations about the kind of assistance it will receive or how quickly it will arrive. During the last World War, the United States placed its fleet in the Atlantic, while Japan guaranteed the Pacific. Now, if the United States wants Britain to stand alongside Germany and overtake it, it must do more than it has already heard. He said that the Prime Minister should consider the entire issue of manpower allocation and establish a true wartime administrative council, composed of three or four people, to focus solely on studying wartime issues, and that the Prime Minister should adopt carefully considered strategies.</p>
<p>Britain Focuses on Relations with Turkey</p>
<p>Prime Minister Churchill rose to speak, ending the two-day debate. He first addressed Lloyd George's arguments, saying, "If there was any particularly unpleasant argument in the debate, it was the one made by Mr. George. Mr. George criticized the Foreign Secretary for not mentioning Spain, the Soviet Union, Vichy, and Turkey. It must be understood that this is not a debate on the entire foreign policy. The Foreign Secretary's remarks should be judged not only on what he has said, but also on what he has not said. If the Foreign Secretary did not mention Spain, it was not because we did not receive much information from that area, nor because the information we received was rarely worth reporting. But I do not know how to describe the Spanish situation in terms that would be beneficial to our current situation. There is much to say about the Soviet Union, but I am not sure that saying it would be beneficial, and I do not know if saying it would earn the gratitude of the Soviet government. We can speak freely about all the tragedies of Vichy, but I do not believe that verbose statements will benefit us. As for Turkey, a country whose relationship with Britain we value highly, its actions in this World War are of utmost importance. Mr. George spoke of this country with solemn words, for which I am grateful. There are two points I can mention to alleviate Mr. George's concerns about Turkey. First, regarding the passage of German ships carrying troops through the Dardanelles to seize Greek islands, Turkey had no right to prevent the German ships. The clauses of the Straits Convention can be reviewed. I believe that one merchant ship can be used to occupy an island, but other ships belonging to Germany and Italy can also be used for the same purpose. This is a matter of interpreting the Convention, which is something Turkey must handle. Second, regarding the treaty between Turkey and Iran (i.e., Persia), this treaty is related to plans to strengthen the borders of both countries. We are aware of its details. This treaty has been under discussion for a long time and will now be implemented from April 1st."</p>
<p>Government Structure Will Not Be Hastily Reorganized</p>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, presenting the reasons for the government's vote of confidence to confirm the government's position, and briefly described the war situation in various aspects. He said that General Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Middle East, currently has approximately 500,000 troops. Britain is determined to maintain its position in the Mediterranean and the Nile with all its strength. He believes that victory is certain. The enemy has superior armored vehicles in the western desert, but the air forces are evenly matched. Britain has no intention of abandoning Crete or Tobruk. The rapid advance of German forces in the desert was indeed unexpected by British generals, but the outcome of the war is still undecided. British forces in Iraq are now receiving a steady stream of reinforcements from India. Yesterday, the defenders of Bania broke out and defeated the besieging Iraqi forces, capturing 26 officers and 408 soldiers. It is estimated that the Iraqi army suffered approximately 1,000 casualties. The Prime Minister responded to George's criticisms regarding the government's organization, saying that since the current structure is operating smoothly and effectively, he does not intend to reorganize it hastily. The military operations in Libya and Greece were never in conflict with the opinions of military experts. All decisions were made in accordance with the situation in a united, free, and unforced manner. As the head of the government, he naturally assumes full responsibility.</p>
<p>Maintaining Shipping Will Not Be a Problem</p>
<p>The Prime Minister concluded by mentioning the continuous aid from the United States to Britain, saying that in 1941, Britain would be able to maintain its minimum necessary shipping. By 1942, the construction of American merchant ships would certainly increase greatly. He had obtained assurances from the United States regarding shipbuilding. Combined with Britain's own shipbuilding program, 1942 could certainly be managed comfortably. If it could be sustained until 1943, then all problems could be easily solved. President Roosevelt's announcement of maritime patrols will reduce some of the work for the United States in the Atlantic, but Britain still needs more assistance and can obtain more help in many areas. Some people say that Britain will get all the assistance it needs, but he is cautious about this because British cabinet members cannot predict American policy. It is not difficult to imagine the entire process of psychological transformation into tangible things of a great democratic country with a population of 120 million, once it is launched. This is why Hitler fears the United States and has not declared war on it. The British Prime Minister continued, "I have never underestimated our difficulties and dangers. We are fighting for survival at every moment. But Hitler also has his difficulties. If we remain united, do our best, and help each other like a large family, then I dare to say that final victory will belong to us." (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Iraqi Dispute May Be Resolved, Forces Besieging Habbaniya Driven Back, British Armored Forces Occupy Rutba</h3>
<p>Ankara – It is generally believed here that the prospects for resolving the Anglo-Iraqi dispute are gradually brightening. The Iraqi Minister of Defense is scheduled to arrive here today. The Turkish side has expressed its approval of his selection for this important task. People with close contact with Iraqi sources are also optimistic about the possibility of resolving the dispute today. Some even say that if some face-saving measures can be taken for Ali al-Gaylani, the entire incident can be easily resolved. Currently, Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan are all eager to see the resolution of this dispute, and the difficult position of Ali al-Gaylani can also be seen in the orders issued by the Iraqi General Headquarters, which instruct troops to conserve ammunition because it is not easy to replenish. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Somewhere in Palestine – Former Iraqi Prime Minister Madfa said here today, commenting on the situation, that this incident is merely a summer storm that will soon disappear without a trace. He is highly respected by Muslims and said that every true patriot of the Arab people knows that the underlying purpose of the destructive actions that have occurred in Iraq is to disrupt order and fuel the arrogance of the aggressors. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest – It is reported here that the Soviet Union has proposed mediating the Anglo-Iraqi conflict. At the same time, it is reported that a large Turkish army is gathering on the Iraqi border. Thousands of Arab Turks are currently registering at the Iraqi Consulate in Beirut, seeking to join the Iraqi army. It is claimed that Basra is still under siege, but British forces have launched attacks with tanks, inflicting heavy losses on the Iraqi camel corps. (8th International Telegram)</p>
<p>Cairo – A communiqué issued here states that on Tuesday, British armored squadrons and recruited Iraqi soldiers operating from Habbaniya drove back the besieging Iraqi forces, overlooking the positions of the British camp at Habbaniya. The British Air Force continued to attack Iraqi fortifications. On Tuesday, it closely assisted the British Army in bombing and strafing the enemy and attacked the enemy forces retreating towards Fallujah. The Iraqi army suffered heavy casualties, while the British army suffered very few casualties. More than 300 Iraqi soldiers have been captured. The Moussaka al-Rashid enemy airfield was bombed again, destroying an entire hangar and one twin-engine aircraft, and severely damaging several others. The ground of the airfield was also heavily damaged. British aircraft met no resistance during the raid. The Iraqi Prime Minister's appeal for assistance from the Axis powers has not yet been answered. Recent news makes it clear that the Iraqi military coup failed before it matured. Military sources in Cairo claim that there is no large-scale military action in Iraq, only a small detachment of British troops on an expedition there. It is now clear that all Ali al-Gaylani has obtained is the support of a portion of the Iraqi army, and not the support he expected. However, the Axis powers have been conducting extensive propaganda in Iraq for years, and it will take some time to clear this up. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo – According to the latest communiqué issued here, the situation in Habbaniya and Basra remains calm after the British forces repelled a portion of the Iraqi forces attacking Habbaniya on May 6.

<h3>British Aircraft Reconnaissance Syria</h3>
<p>Stockholm – According to the London Daily Express, the British Air Force has been conducting reconnaissance over Syria to determine whether German aircraft are present or whether aircraft are being transported to Iraq via Syria. The newspaper believes that the 15,000 French troops in Syria are not sufficient to suppress the Syrian rebellion. (8th Huitong Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Italian Forces Withdraw from Dhibili District in Central Abyssinia, Fresh British Air Force Arrives in Western Desert, Supplies for German Forces in North Africa Increasingly Difficult</h3>
<p>London – According to news here, Italian forces have withdrawn from the Dhibili district, 44 miles northeast of Godda in central Abyssinia. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo – A communiqué issued here yesterday stated that on the 5th of this month, British forces launched a night attack on enemy outposts around Tobruk, inflicting heavy damage and capturing several enemy soldiers. Yesterday, due to sandstorms obscuring the sky, traffic and visibility were difficult, so there are no detailed reports. After the enemy's failed attack on Tobruk last week, the pressure they are exerting seems to be easing. The enemy's dive bombing was most intense from May 1st to 3rd, but it has now weakened. The enemy is now trying to hold the shallow depression in the southwest corner of the Tobruk area, but they have been repeatedly attacked and shelled by British forces. The coastal area is experiencing strong sandstorms, making traffic difficult, and both sides are affected. The British mechanized forces in the Sollum area continued their patrol activities. On May 3rd and 4th, British mobile units maneuvered behind Bardia and Capuzzo, causing the German forces to send troops away from Sollum to patrol in the Sahara Desert to the south to prevent British forces from attacking their rear again. Some German supplies were supplied by transport planes, but many of these planes have been destroyed by the British Air Force, making German supplies increasingly difficult. This is because fresh British Air Force units have arrived in the Western Desert. On Sunday night, the British Air Force attacked the Benina, Derna, Gazala, and Berka airfields, causing fires and explosions. On Sunday night, the Calato airfield on the island of Rhodes in the Dodecanese was also bombed, causing heavy damage and fires. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Another Axis Threat: Preparing for War Against the United States, Germany Labels Stimson a "War Merchant," Japan Says It Will Fulfill Its Obligations</h3>
<p>Rome – An article published yesterday in the newspaper of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano hinted that Germany was preparing for war against the United States for control of the Panama Canal. The newspaper said, "Germany originally recognized the Anglo-Saxon people's control over Panama, and even recognized the importance of the Suez Canal. However, Germany needs at least to maintain the control system of the Rhine and Danube rivers to build a major position in Central and Southeastern Europe. However, the Anglo-Saxons are not willing to allow Germany to obtain this kind of interest. To this day, this problem still needs to be solved by force. Therefore, these canals (referring to Panama and Suez), which were originally used as avenues for the victory of Western nations, will now become dead ends for them in wartime." (8th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome – The Rome radio station here announced yesterday that American ships entering the Axis blockade zone would be sunk. The radio station said, "We are waiting for Roosevelt's war. The Axis powers and Japan are all ready." (8th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin – A German government spokesperson yesterday attacked Colonel Stimson's request for the U.S. Navy to take action in the Atlantic war, calling it a "speech by a notorious war merchant." The German government believes that this speech does not represent the official position. The German government spokesperson said, "Stimson should understand what his demands will achieve in the future." (8th International Telegram)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman and member of the Matsuoka delegation to Germany, Nagai, revealed yesterday that Germany has never asked Japan to assist Germany in the European war. Reportedly, Hitler made a lengthy and fierce speech attacking Britain during his meeting with Matsuoka. Hitler reportedly said that Germany was determined to fight alone. Nagai said that he did not want to speak on behalf of Matsuoka, but personally, he was deeply impressed by the strength of the German army and believed that Britain would surrender in June or July. Nagai said, "I believe that Germany's strengthening of submarine warfare, air warfare, and finally launching simultaneous attacks on British strongholds will force Britain to raise the white flag in early summer. I also believe that the invasion of Britain can be successful. The Balkan campaign shows that the German army cannot be stopped. American aid is not enough to save Britain. I do not want to imagine the terrible consequences after the United States joins the war. I believe the whole world will fall into war, and all of mankind will be reduced to beasts. Japan is determined to fulfill its obligations. If the Axis powers are attacked and forced to the point of no return, and the day that the United States goes to war actually arrives, then the Japanese people will unite and, with a great spirit, will be determined to sacrifice everything to strive for victory."

<h3>France and Germany Establish Agreement in Paris: Open Zones of Occupation</h3>
<p>Goods and People Can Travel Freely in Major Emergencies</p>
<p>Discussion Underway to Reduce German Military Expenses in the Occupied Zone</p>
<p>Vichy – An official announcement was made recently that Lieutenant General Darlan, Assistant to the Cabinet and Minister of the Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Navy, after meeting with German military authorities in Paris, has established an agreement stipulating that various goods and securities may pass through the borders of the French occupied and free zones. People in both zones may travel to each other's zones in the event of special circumstances, such as illness or the death of immediate family members. However, postal traffic and letters between the two zones are still not allowed; only postcards can pass freely. In addition, active-duty French army and air force personnel may also request leave to visit relatives in the occupied zone. Furthermore, the issue of reducing France's burden for the German garrison in the occupied zone is still under discussion. According to the armistice agreement between France and Germany, France is responsible for providing a total of 20 million marks, or 400 million francs, daily for the use of the German garrison. There is now a desire to reduce this total to 15 million marks, or 300 million francs. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Vichy – Lieutenant General Darlan, Assistant to the Cabinet, is currently in Paris continuing negotiations with the German authorities and has not yet returned here. However, the government has released the results of his negotiations to the press (see separate dispatch). However, according to political insiders, the ongoing negotiations between France and Germany have only just begun and have not yet concluded. As for the agreement that has already been established, in addition to relieving some of the people's suffering, it further proves that the current relationship between France and Germany is based on sincerity and trust. It is said that since the resignation of the former Assistant to the Cabinet, Laval, on December 13 of last year, the relationship between France and Germany did experience some twists and turns. However, as of this moment, everything has been resolved, and the relationship between the two sides has fully returned to its former state. As for the practical results of this agreement, the most important of these is that various goods will now be able to pass through the border between the French free zone and the occupied zone. This will undoubtedly be of great benefit to domestic commerce in France. This is because the economic structures of the free zone and the occupied zone are completely different and have complementary functions. In the future, if they can communicate with each other, it will truly be a blessing for the nation. As for the measure of allowing securities to circulate between the free zone and the occupied zone, it is also extremely important. In general, brokers now in the free zone will return to Paris as a result of this, which will also be of great benefit to the Paris stock exchange. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris – French Assistant to the Cabinet and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Navy, General Darlan, had a long talk with Laval for three hours yesterday in Paris. Darlan also met with the German Ambassador to the French occupied zone, Abetz. However, the content of the talks was not disclosed. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Vichy – After returning here from Paris, Assistant to the Cabinet Darlan reported by long distance telephone to Marshal Pétain on his talks with German Ambassador Abetz during this trip. Marshal Pétain is currently resting at a villa on the French Riviera and will still stay there for a day or two according to the original plan before returning here soon. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>London – Paris Radio reported that General Béthouart has left his private residence near Caen and is traveling by special car to meet Darlan. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Vichy – Unofficial news from Paris claims that the opening or expansion to the northernmost zone of France is imminent because the exchange of food between the two sides is now imperative. Paris also feels the shortage of food, especially the lack of meat and fats. According to reports from here, the shortage of food has reached a serious stage of famine. Unconfirmed news from Paris claims that the Germans may move their blockade line back to the Somme River area, so that Paris can be included in the provinces southwest of Paris, which are rich in meat and butter. The Germans will only retain a 12-square-mile zone along the French coast and all ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel. As for the French residents of Nord and Calais, they will be prohibited from going out until the war against England ends. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>England Deeply Fears France Will Let Germany Use Syria</p>
<p>London – Commentators here are continuing to speculate whether French Assistant Darlan has already secretly ceded Syrian airbases to Germany for use, allowing German aircraft squadrons to fly to Iraq from Syria. Commentators are also expressing concern in newspapers that Darlan has allowed German troops to pass through Syria, enabling Germany to launch a massive armored tactical offensive against Egypt and cooperate with the troops of Rommel, the German commander in Africa fighting in the Western Desert. They are also speculating whether Darlan can allow German troops to pass through the French free zone to Spain to attack Gibraltar. Diplomats also believe that Darlan may also give the French fleet to Germany and conclude an agreement with Germany to open roads between the free zone and the occupied zone, so that food and essential goods can reach the free zone in exchange. However, they also believe that given Marshal Pétain's vow not to attack Britain, France is unlikely to take this action. A British correspondent in Cairo, in describing the end of the siege of Habbaniyah, said that Rashid's troops have scattered to Baghdad and are facing defeat in the first Iraqi War. A British correspondent in Basra said that supporters of Rashid are complaining that the Axis powers are not providing assistance and claiming that Rashid's troops are eagerly awaiting German aid from the sky, even using flares to welcome the arrival of German aircraft squadrons. They strongly argue that Hitler will be able to quickly resolve the Iraqi crisis and force Britain to engage in a long and arduous war to defend Middle Eastern oil fields. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>After Signing of New Franco-Japanese Treaty, Japan Solely Enjoys Benefits</h3>
<p>More Than 40 Types of Japanese Goods Enter Vietnam Duty-Free; Other Hundreds of Types Subject to Very Low Taxes</p>
<p>Tokyo – Today, newspapers published the details of the new Japanese-Vietnamese economic treaty signed on Tuesday. The treaty is valid for five years and will remain in effect unless one of the parties notifies the other of its cancellation before the expiration date. The shipping treaty stipulates that Japanese people and Japanese ships will receive "national treatment" in Vietnam. There are more than 30 clauses regarding tariffs, commerce, and payment methods, as well as supplementary documents. Both parties receive most-favored-nation treatment. However, the treaty lists more than 40 types of important Japanese goods that can be imported into Vietnam duty-free. In addition, more than 130 types of Japanese manufactured goods, including cotton fabrics and sundries, will be subject to new tariffs that are even lower than the current lowest tariffs. There are also more than 400 types of Japanese manufactured goods that will be taxed at the current lowest tariff rate. It is also stipulated that in order to develop commerce between the two parties, Japan will purchase white rice, corn, pepper, cowhide, zinc, tin, iron, manganese, and other goods from Vietnam, and Vietnam will purchase textiles and sundries from Japan. The price of the Vietnamese goods purchased by Japan will be paid in Japanese yen to the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the Yokohama Specie Bank will open a current account with the Bank of Vietnam to handle it. It will be cleared every three months. If the difference between the two sides exceeds 5 million Japanese yen, it will be cleared in foreign currency, approximately US dollars. It is also stipulated that Japanese imports of rice may be deferred for 12 months. More than a dozen Japanese trading companies may join the Vietnam Importers and Exporters Association. Japanese financiers may participate in Vietnamese agriculture, mining, electricity, public utilities, and transportation concessions in the form of joint-stock companies. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – France and Thailand are scheduled to sign a peace treaty here tomorrow. The treaty includes 12 articles in the main text and 3 supplementary protocols. The main points are as follows: (1) Part of the eastern Cambodian state of Vietnam is ceded to Thailand and shall be demilitarized. (2) Two districts of the Laotian state on the right bank of the Mekong River are also ceded to Thailand. (3) Thailand guarantees completely equal treatment for French and Thai people. (4) Thailand shall compensate Vietnam 600,000 piastres for the houses in the ceded areas. (5) The provisions of the 1926 treaty prohibiting fortifications on both sides of the Mekong River shall be repealed. (6) The borders between the two countries shall be demarcated within one year. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Ministry of Finance today issued a directive to all foreign exchange banks, stating that henceforth all foreign exchange transactions with Vietnam will be based on Japanese yen. Any other transactions must obtain official permission. Today, the Yokohama Specie Bank announced the exchange rate between the piastre and the Japanese yen as 100 to 98.125. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to semi-official sources, the peace treaty resolving the Thai-Vietnamese dispute will be formally signed here on Friday. At the same time, Japan, Thailand, and Vietnam will exchange notes stating that Thailand and Vietnam will not conclude agreements with any third country that conflict with Japan's interests. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>French People in Vietnam Dissatisfied with New Treaty</p>
<p>Saigon – Yesterday, local officials had no comment on the conclusion of the commercial and shipping agreement between Japan and Vietnam in Tokyo, but well-informed sources condemned it. They declared, "We have learned that this agreement is extremely beneficial to Japan but detrimental to Vietnam." Well-informed sources announced that Japan is preparing to extract from Vietnam. On Tuesday, there were eight Japanese ships loading goods in Saigon, but no goods were transported here from Japan. The conclusion of this agreement means that France is only giving Vietnam empty words. Authoritative sources believe that this treaty has not yet satisfied Japan's desires for Vietnam. If war breaks out in the Pacific, Japan will seize more of the goals it seeks. Well-informed sources said that many of the Japanese ships docked here first docked in Bangkok to unload military supplies, and then sailed empty to Vietnamese ports to load rice and rubber. According to unconfirmed unofficial reports from Bangkok, Japan's transport of military supplies to Thailand is now increasing, resulting in more empty ships sailing to Saigon to load Vietnamese products. Well-informed sources said that in recent weeks, thousands of Japanese men have arrived in Thailand for "tourism." There are now more than 10,000 Japanese people in Bangkok. Foreign aviation circles say that in the past four months, every Japanese plane flying from Saigon to Bangkok has carried Japanese officers, and returned empty. At the same time, foreigners arriving here from Singapore declared that large numbers of British reinforcements arrive in Singapore every day, including airplanes. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Ta Kung Pao declared today that the Franco-Japanese signing of the economic treaty is another step in Japan's southward advance. Vietnam has entered the third stage of Japanese control and has in effect become a Japanese colony. If Japanese troops enter Vietnam, it will be entirely a territory of Japan. The second step will be to pass through Thailand to attack Burma. (United Press, 8th)</p>

<h3>No Diplomatic Changes After Stalin Takes New Position</h3>
<p>Baocheng – The Baocheng radio station announced that Stalin's appointment as Chairman of the People's Committee is clearly due to the increasingly tense international situation. Local newspapers believe that Stalin was originally the true leader of the Soviet Union, and his current personal assumption of important government positions is a sign of tense times. The newspaper continued that Soviet foreign policy will not change. The Soviet Union has so far avoided participating in the war and will maintain a neutral policy in the future. The Soviet Union has signed non-aggression treaties with Germany and Japan. There will be no surprising developments in diplomacy. Stalin will probably focus on domestic issues. He has a "flexible mind" and must know the most suitable path for the Soviet Union. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>

<h3>War Situation for the Week of May 2nd to 8th</h3>
<p>Good news arrived. Soldiers on the Guozhehai front in Zhejiang bravely launched a counter-offensive on the 2nd, recovering Wenzhou, Haimen, and Ruian. Now, there are no more Japanese tracks on both sides of the Lingjiang, Oujiang, and Feiyunjiang Rivers. The battle situation can be briefly described as follows: (1) On the first day, the Chinese counter-offensive troops began to act. At dawn on the 2nd, they launched a large-scale attack in two directions, first capturing the high ground southwest of the city. Chinese troops then charged into the west gate of Wenzhou at 11:00 am, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese. The Japanese were unable to hold out and retreated towards Ruian through the southeast gates. The Chinese ambushed them along the way, causing many Japanese casualties, with more than a thousand killed in action. (2) In the Haimen area, after the Chinese army captured Huangyan, they advanced towards Haimen. On the night of the 2nd, the Japanese set fire to the town. The Chinese took advantage of the situation and launched a fierce attack. The Japanese fled in droves by ship. The Chinese then entered the town of Haimen at dawn on the 3rd. (3) In the Ruian area, after the Chinese army captured Wenzhou city, on the north bank of the Feiyunjiang River, the Chinese army then besieged Ruian city. By 2:00 pm on the 3rd, the Chinese had entered the city. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army on the south bank of the Feiyunjiang River also repelled the Japanese near Pingyang city, and then pursued them, recovering the city of Shawai that afternoon. At this point, there were no more Japanese tracks on both sides of the Feiyunjiang River. Overall, the above battle situation was due to the strong morale of the Chinese army and their courageous fighting, which resulted in this victory. It is very clear that the Japanese so-called automatic withdrawal is all lies. As for the Zhuji battles, the Chinese army had crossed the line of Waicheng Street, Tingwuta City at 10:00 am on the 6th, and then captured strongholds such as Phoenix Mountain, Tiger Head Mountain, and Hucun, directly pressing</p>
<p>Chongqing – A spokesperson for the Military Commission said, "When I attended the foreign press conference last week, I predicted that the Japanese army would soon retreat north in the suburbs of Zhuji. In western Zhejiang, the two cities of Yuhang and Fuyang were both captured by the Chinese this week, killing many Japanese soldiers and destroying many Japanese warehouses. In addition,</p>
<p>Southern Anhui</p>
<p>The Japanese army attacked Hanting Town from Jiuli Mountain on the 4th, but were immediately driven back by the Chinese. In this battle, a total of 400 Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army in Yingshan, northern Hubei, gathered more than 10,000 troops and advanced towards Yinjiadian and Gaocheng on the 6th. They are now being blocked by the Chinese and are still developing. It is expected that there will be a major battle soon. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Grains: The Public Awaits the Municipal Council's Rice Arrival; Rice Sales Suddenly Clear, and Rice Prices Fall Again; More Than 570,000 Bags of Rice Arrived in April; The Stockpilers' Manipulations Are Utterly Unjustifiable</h3>
<p>The decline in the price of imported rice has not stopped. It is rising and falling, and the situation is weak. There is a possibility of a further decline in the market. The joint sale by the two concessions is inevitable. The first batch of 50,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice is already on its way. It is also said that the first batch of Gong rice has been urgently telegraphed for loading. After the second and third batches arrive in Shanghai one after another, the various rice stocks in the market will have no considerable outlet amid the stagnation of customer sales. Therefore, although large households are trying to struggle, they have actually reached the end of their rope. At present, they can only reduce prices as soon as possible to sell off, and perhaps still obtain a small profit. Therefore, after the market opened, floating households were most eager to sell off. However, sales were normal. Because, except for those in urgent need, those who can wait for the arrival of the Municipal Council's rice before buying would rather endure hunger temporarily and do not want to buy this expensive rice. As a result, store sales have cleared, and customer sales are stagnant. The stockpilers are also thinking of releasing some stock. A violent price decline has started again, heading downwards like a waterfall. In an instant, Xiaojiao rice plummeted by as much as six yuan. Rice of the highest quality opened at only 124 yuan, and mid-range rice at 123 yuan. At this point, there were some inquiries, and the market turned flat, before quickly closing. As a result, the closing prices were 135-136 yuan for No. 1 old Saigon rice, 128 yuan for No. 1 Siam rice, 126 yuan for Huojiao rice, 123-124 yuan for Mindang rice, 123-124 yuan for Xiaojiao rice, 111 yuan for Tokyo Jian rice, 102 yuan for Sui Jian rice, and down to 95 yuan. As for other No. 2 Saigon and Siam rice, no transactions were made.</p>
<p>Original bags (one shi and two dou and a half): Yinghua Si No. 1 current Saigon rice, from 153 yuan to 151.5 yuan; April-May, 156-157 yuan to 155 yuan; Xiaojiao current, 151 yuan; broken rice current, 120 yuan; futures, 120 yuan to 117 yuan, all lower than the previous market by varying amounts of 2, 3, 5, or 6 yuan. The total daily transaction volume for current rice was only 5,025 bags because local sales were very slow, and customer assistance was also slight. Yinghua Si had a transaction volume of 1,300 tons.</p>
<p>Since the rice price in this city has risen sharply, this newspaper has investigated the import of foreign rice daily, disclosing the number of arrivals at the port in the newspaper, and then calculating and announcing the total amount of rice arriving each month. Now, according to our investigation, 573,651 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai last month (April), including:</p>
<p>Rangoon 128,100</p>
<p>Saigon 113,323</p>
<p>Haiphong 15,300</p>
<p>Siam 11,804</p>
<p>Hong Kong 305,124</p>
<p>This is more than 114,100 bags less than the imports in March. As of the end of April this year, the amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai in the four months was astonishing, totaling more than 2,278,800 bags. Therefore, the high rice price was obviously caused by the monopoly of unscrupulous merchants. Recently, thanks to the proper control by the authorities and the agreement with the Hong Kong government to directly transport and sell rice, the general stockpilers have begun to feel threatened. Therefore, the market price has slightly declined, and the price of corn has also decreased accordingly. The other day (the 7th), the Zhuhua Company's Zhibade vessel transported more than 3,000 bags of corn from Hong Kong, docking at the Blue Funnel Wharf for unloading. It is said that the Rangoon Xiaojiao rice purchased by the Municipal Council, transported from Hong Kong, is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 12th. According to reliable sources yesterday, it may arrive one or two days earlier, which is also possible.</p>
<p>Although the sales of Guomi such as Houbo and Japonica rice and glutinous rice are still not smooth, the market has limited stocks, and the owners are not in a hurry to sell. Therefore, although the market is also affected by foreign rice, it is not as wildly declining as foreign rice. Xijing rice is priced at 142 yuan, Kun Jing rice at 140 yuan, early and late Nanhang rice at 135-136 yuan, Hong Kong white rice at 125-126 yuan, and glutinous rice at 115-116 yuan, slightly lower than the previous market by one or two yuan.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market's Popularity Gradually Weakens</h3>
<p>The foreign flour market situation has entered a state of hesitation. Because after the continuous decline in rice prices in recent days, people's hearts have felt weak. Scattered stockpiles have gradually been released. Jinlong brand Kan flour once fell to as low as 32 yuan, which began to attract inquiries from actual sales in this street and customers from the Nanyang gang. The market opened yesterday with a good situation. It is estimated that two or three thousand bags of Jinlong flour were purchased by local customers at a price of 32.56 yuan, and Australian Fenghua Wupai brand flour at 32.89 yuan, and foreign Fort flour at 33.23 yuan. However, the selling pressure in the market was strong again. It was rumored that the Municipal Council decided to sell 50,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice at a flat price of only 110 yuan. Rice prices fell again, and people's hearts turned bearish. Inquiries were watching. Later, the market price fell by 3-4 jiao. The Hua factory's flat-priced flour remained at 29 yuan, supplied according to the original quota by the designated merchants. There was no market for wheat.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Plummets by Six Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for miscellaneous grains and oil cakes showed no special changes in the morning session, continuing the potential of the previous day. However, after the market reported lower rice prices, all prices saw frequent declines. As a result, Dalian soybean oil fell sharply by six yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 400 barrels, with prices declining from 180-181 yuan to 177 yuan. There was no market opening for soybean oil cakes as there were few buyers and sellers. The market was completely dominated by speculation. In yesterday's market, under the pressure of long position closures, there were still short selling transactions. Only Shen Ji's futures cakes had a market, with a total transaction of 24,500 pieces. The price for delivery in the first ten days of May was 21.6 yuan, and the single for the first ten days of May to be delivered in the last ten days of May was 22.35 yuan to 22.4 yuan. The single for the 15th of April was 21.9 yuan to 21.5 yuan. The single for the first ten days of June to be delivered in the first ten days of May was 21.7 yuan to 22.1 yuan, and the price for the last ten days of May was 23 yuan to 22.3 yuan, which later became 22.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: The US Enters the Vortex of War; Far-term USD Futures Lack Buyers</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: The HSBC exchange rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The black market for GBP/USD eased continuously. This was entirely due to the sharp decline in gold prices, and it was heard that the US Secretary of the Navy advocated warships escorting, which would inevitably lead to involvement in the war. As a result, there were almost no inquiries for the far-term June contract. Recently, HSBC, on behalf of rice trading companies, settled and purchased USD 50,000, causing the rate of 5.25 to ease and then stabilize. The GBP, however, had firmed to 3/25 pence for settlement. In the afternoon, the gold price declined faster, and speculators' enthusiasm for selling increased. Banks had no interest in absorbing. The USD rate of 5.25 suddenly broke out. The selling price for the June contract once reached 5.3125. The GBP exchange rate was stable, ultimately at 3/25 pence. The roll-over only gained 0.015625. The USD June contract was 5.28125. The spot and current month rates were difficult to settle and sell at the above price, and were instead more expensive. It was estimated that speculators held short positions of over USD 3 million in the current month, which they would inevitably have to cover in the middle of the month, or pay to roll over their short positions into the June contract. The roll-over was 0.03125 and 0.0625. The trading volume throughout the day was extremely active.</p>
<p>GBP and USD Continued to Lengthen</p>
<p>In the early morning, foreign telegrams indicated that there was no change in the silver markets in the UK, US, and India, and exchange rates for various countries remained unchanged. The exchange rates officially quoted by the Central Bank were flat. The black market opened early, with bank selling prices for spot GBP at 3/234375 pence and USD at 5.21875, both the same as the closing prices of the previous day. Chinese merchants and speculators initially offered USD 5.25 for the next month, but banks had little interest in accepting. HSBC, on behalf of rice trading companies, absorbed USD 5.25 million sold by Japanese banks such as Mitsui, and the situation became tense again. Later, speculators had a strong desire to sell the June contract, and foreign banks began to show interest in absorbing at a rate of 5.28115. The situation returned to stability. The gold price retreated to the 6,600 yuan level, but was not affected. The closing selling price for USD in June was 5.25, and the current month settled at 5.21857. The GBP had eased to 3/25 pence. In the afternoon, as the gold price continued to decline, Chinese merchants and speculators continued to sell aggressively, offering USD for June at 5.28125 and 5.3125, but banks had little interest in absorbing. Before the closing at 4 pm, the spot and current month rates were still at 5.25. At the 4 pm closing, the current month and futures rates had firmed to 5.28125. The GBP was 3/25 pence. Compared to the previous day's closing price, the USD was longer by 0.0625, and the GBP was longer by 0.015625.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Remittance Rate Decreases</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 8th (Thursday) telegram: The exchange market opened smoothly this morning. The exchange rates for GBP, USD, and JPY remained unchanged. Only the spot Shanghai remittance rate decreased by 7.5 jiao to 463 yuan (the closing price yesterday afternoon rose to 463.75 yuan). At 11:30, it stabilized. The spot USD increased by 0.0625 to 24.3125. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>Tianjin GBP and USD Both Increase</p>
<p>Tianjin, 8th (Thursday) telegram: The exchange market opened eased this morning. The London cable transfer rate increased by 0.015625 to 3/28125 pence. The New York cable transfer rate increased by 0.03125 to 5.3125. The Shanghai remittance rate remained unchanged, still at 99.25 yuan. The black market for "Joint Banknotes" was cheaper by 0.38 yuan, at 50.088 yuan.</p>
<h3>Amid a Chorus of Selling, the Gold Price Fell Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market price of gold saw a resurgence of declines. From morning to night, the price was constantly retreating in a roundabout way, breaking into the 6,600 yuan mark. People's hearts were unusually weak, with widespread rumors that the US Secretary of the Navy was also advocating for warships to provide escorts, leading to expectations of entanglement in the vortex. The foreign exchange rate eased sharply, and there was no demand for the far-term USD, with the price exceeding the 5.25 mark that speculators had been looking at. Therefore, although there were large short-covering orders from remittance houses such as Dafeng and gold shops such as Deda, each purchasing over 10,000 taels, the selling pressure from securities firms such as Yida, Tongkangyong, Zhifu, Chida, Hengji, Mingfeng, Yiyi, Decheng, and Xinyuan was intense. Supply and demand remained disparate, and the price fell sharply by 98 yuan, from the morning opening price of 6,645 yuan to 6,548 yuan before the evening closing. After the closing, the price retreated to 6,545 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 70,000 to 80,000 taels. Cash gold shop Chengji first sold 100 taels to Yida, and then immediately reversed the transaction, and Mingfeng and Jishi each purchased 50 taels at a price 130 yuan higher than the futures price, and then purchased another 100 taels from Wanfeng and 50 taels from Xianghe, all 135 yuan higher. At noon, it was 140 yuan higher. Defu wanted to purchase. In the afternoon, Chengda sold 100 taels to Chengji, 160 yuan higher. Later, Baokang sold 50 taels each to Laotianbao and Yongfengyu, 170 yuan higher. However, the futures price was still about 50 yuan lower than the previous day. The price of jewelry gold once reached as high as 700 yuan, and finally closed at 695 yuan. The customs gold and other prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Black Market Price Plunged Nearly 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the price per bar (10 taels) dropped by 20 yuan due to the difficulty in selling USD at 5.25, so people's hearts weakened again. The market opened at 9:15 am at 6,630 yuan. In an instant, Yida, Deda, and Yiyuan came in to purchase, rebounding to 6,645 yuan. Xinyuan sold, retreating to 6,633 yuan in sparse trading. Deda still went long strongly, pushing it up to 6,642 yuan, and the market hovered around 6,635 yuan for a long time. At 10:45 am, Mingfeng, Yifeng, Tongkangyong, and Defu sold sharply, and people's hearts were empty, falling to around 6,620 yuan, before slightly stabilizing. Before the noon closing, it retreated to 6,600 yuan. Xinfengyong purchased over 1,000 taels aggressively, slightly pushing up the price. The noon closing price was 6,607 yuan. After the closing, Defu sold aggressively, falling to 6,595 yuan. The afternoon market was even weaker, opening at 2 pm at 6,580 yuan, 17 yuan lower than the noon closing price. Dafeng purchased again, pushing it up to 6,585 yuan. Yida, Deda, and Chida rushed to sell, and the foreign exchange rate was reported to have eased, further softening people's hearts, immediately falling by 35 yuan to 6,550 yuan. Dafeng and Deda poured in huge sums to strongly push it up to 6,570 yuan. Upon hearing that the USD had been sold strongly to 5.3125, Defu, Yiyuan, Yifeng, and Chida sold again, retreating to 6,548 yuan, which was purchased by Deda and Dafeng, rising to 6,565 yuan. At the 4 pm closing, the price retreated again to 6,552 yuan, 98 yuan lower than the previous day's noon closing price. Based on the USD settlement price of 5.28125 for May, the calculated price was 6,594 yuan, a difference of 42 yuan. The fluctuation for the day was 97 yuan. After the closing, it dropped to 6,545 yuan. The selling price of this brand of cash gold was 190 yuan higher than the black market futures price, and the purchase price was 60 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for the current standard gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Changed Three Times</p>
<p>The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael in silver shops: Datongxing and Xintongxing increased by 5 yuan at 10 am, to 700 yuan. At 2 pm, it decreased by 10 yuan, to 690 yuan. At 2:30 pm, it increased by 5 yuan again, to 695 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 40 yuan, which was considered a flat.</p>
<h3>The Decline in Foreign Currencies is Still Slight</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: Although the black market price of gold fell sharply by 100 yuan, the decline in GBP and USD was slow, ultimately decreasing by only one yuan each. The price of GBP remained unchanged, with the market price remaining flat. The USD once retreated to 6 jiao 6 fen, but ultimately closed at 18 yuan 6 jiao 8 fen, a decrease of 2 jiao compared to the previous day. The price of Hong Kong currency also declined, retreating to 4 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen in the evening market. There were no changes in the prices of Japanese and Korean currencies. The former remained at 2 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen, and the latter remained at the original price of 1 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Securities: It is Difficult for Domestic Bonds to Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market for government bonds was still in a listless and weak state. Although there were many participants in the first market gathering, they were very slack. During the market hours, most of them did not enter the market to trade, but stood by and watched. It can be seen that both the long and short sides were very persistent. Therefore, it was difficult for the market to rise, and it was also difficult for it to fall. It was necessary to wait for a strong change in the environment, a shock to people's hearts, before the market situation would fluctuate. Currently, we are still waiting for the opportunity. Yesterday morning, Shunchang purchased, and Yitai Tongkang also purchased. Lianyi Hongda and Lianhe sold, with more selling than buying. In the afternoon, Tongkang continued to purchase, and Xinyuan also had needs. Hengkang, Jiucheng, and Hengfu all sold, still in a situation of oversupply. Therefore, the result was still a small decrease of 1.5 jiao to 5.5 jiao. There was no change in Class A. The transaction volume was approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Nanyang Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 20 yuan 7.5 jiao.</p>
<p>The opening of the stock market at the Public Industry Assembly Hall maintained the original price unchanged. However, due to the widespread rumors of negative news, the buying lineup suddenly shook, and the prices of various stocks began to decline. The selling pressure intensified in the afternoon. Although the closing price rebounded slightly, the overall trend remained soft.</p>
<p>London, 7th (Wednesday) telegram: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and stocks of various British companies in the Far East were flat. Only the price of HSBC Bank's British registration continued to rise by 0.5 GBP, to 71.5 GBP. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Large Players Painfully Cut Losses; Yarn Prices Fall Straight Down; Shuangma Has Entered the 540 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen day by day, declined again yesterday. This was because the situation in the Pacific was tense, the foreign exchange rate was lengthened, the standard gold price fell sharply, and at the same time, there were very few actual transactions. As a result, those who had purchased at high prices were uneasy and came out of the cage. As for the floating longs, seeing the unfavorable environment, they painfully cut their positions. The market price went downstream. The high price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,571 yuan, and the low price was 1,546 yuan. The initial price in the afternoon was 1,541 yuan. The securities firms picked up the shorts and returned to 1,546 yuan. However, a certain major speculator cut 1,000 bales of orders limited at 1,540 yuan, falling into the 540 yuan mark, to 1,538 yuan. Retail investors who profited scooped up, and then it went to 1,545 yuan. Finally, the standard gold price continued to fall and was still tired, and the final price was 1,538.5 yuan. At present, the yarn market has failed to break out of the 600 yuan mark three times, and the price of miscellaneous brand yarn is too low, coupled with the easing of the foreign exchange rate, so the market cannot support it and goes down. Some people say that they are afraid to see around 1,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning, and the market situation was originally normal. However, Daye Company purchased a few bales, and then people's hearts vibrated. The first session opened at 1,560 yuan. After a long period of holding, due to the purchase by large households, everyone raised the price. The chips in the market were slightly tight, and those who snapped up purchases came to collect. It gradually rose to 1,571 yuan. As soon as the price was high, the standard gold price unexpectedly continued to ease, and the foreign exchange rate was lengthened, suddenly falling by 10 yuan to 1,559 yuan. Since then, the news has been unfavorable, and the market situation has continued to decline to 1,546 yuan. The statistics of the trading volume in half a day was 10,575 bales. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 565 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Industry peers 10,000 Statistics 10,575</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Ordinary</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is as light as the yarn market. This is because the factory is not expanding, and the recent arrivals are very strong, and the inventory is more than sufficient than before, so the cotton market is mediocre. In addition, the foreign exchange rate is lengthened, and the yarn market is falling. Although those who hold goods hope for a higher price, it is not possible in fact. A total of 1,339 pieces were made open, and the price fell by 1 or 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Brazilian cotton 40 Chengyu 240 pieces, delivered from warehouse</p>
<p>Also 399 Sentai 100 pieces Also</p>
<p>Indian NT 388 Bingchang 100 pieces Also</p>
<p>Also 388 Dade 200 pieces Also</p>
<p>Peng Yupo 319 Xietongxing 100 pieces Also</p>
<p>Also 317 Also 99 pieces Also</p>
<p>Yamula 232 Shuitaihing 100 pieces Also</p>
<p>Also 135 Zhongye 200 pieces Also</p>
<p>Another message from the Shanghai foreign company's foreign cotton transaction is still firm because of the lively transactions among peers. However, the yarn market is still sluggish, and the international situation is also critical. Therefore, the factory has not dared to purchase in large quantities. Yesterday, only Shenxin and Xinnuo purchased a small amount of Indian cotton and Argentine cotton.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose first due to speculative purchases, and then fell slightly due to sales by the southern gang. As a result, the closing price was about 22 points per pound lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market rose first due to retail purchases, and then was suppressed by sales from various parties. Then, it rose again due to speculative purchases and fell again due to government sales. As a result, the closing price rose by 3 to 4 rupees.</p>
<p>It is also predicted that the market will open lower by 0.25 rupees today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market trend yesterday was unstable due to floating hearts. The opening price of the agricultural market was flat. In the afternoon, due to negative news, the price of cloth suddenly turned downstream. As a result, the price of white fine cloth and fine materials fell by 2.5 jiao per piece, the price of coarse cloth fell by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao, and the price of coarse twill was flat. The price of bleached and dyed cloth fell by 2 or 3 jiao. The transactions on this street were 400 pieces of various cloths, the Zhejiang and Fujian gangs handled 108 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, and poplin, and the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs handled 200 pieces of colored twill, blue cloth, and twill, etc. More than 3,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth were handled in Singapore and other overseas places.</p>
<p>Dongbu: Yesterday, it started to rise and then was tired. The opening price of Longtou fine cloth in the morning was 51 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen. Later, due to the decline in yarn and cloth in the exchange, people's hearts were empty again, and the low price of Longtou was seen at 51 yuan 05 fen. At the closing, it rebounded to 51 yuan 2 jiao. The price of Sijunzi Wahgee was 1 yuan 5 jiao 8 fen, a decrease of 5 li per yard. The spot market will be temporarily suspended for trading for two days (ie, 9th and 10th) due to decoration and painting.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Recent Scarcity of Coarse White</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was approaching the tenth-day settlement date for coarse sugar, and there was also a shortage of incoming shipments, with some unable to deliver within ten days, so the trend became tight again. The association's price list: spot 24 coarse white external warehouse 114 yuan 6 jiao to 5 jiao, an increase of 1 yuan 6 jiao. The futures for May 10 were initially 114 yuan, then rose to 14 yuan 5 jiao to 4 jiao, and further jumped to 15 yuan 6 jiao, 8 jiao, 3 jiao, 4 jiao, and 1 jiao, an increase of 1 yuan 3 jiao. May 20 was listed at 116 yuan to 16 yuan 2 jiao and 1 jiao, and then slightly eased to 115 yuan 8 jiao, 4 jiao, 2 jiao, and 1 jiao, and then returned to 7 jiao, 8 jiao, and 9 jiao, an increase of 2 jiao. Dutch red remained at 89 yuan. Taikoo Che Ri B mark was 116 yuan to 17 yuan, an increase of 1 jiao. DY mark was 105 yuan 5 jiao, and HX mark was 104 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, sugar arrived from Java yesterday (8th) with 2,500 tons, and another 1,000 tons were transshipped to North China.</p>
<h3>Coal and Charcoal: Charcoal is Tired and Cannot Revive</h3>
<p>Regarding the arrival of charcoal, although the route from Wenzhou has been cut off, the source is still rare, but the sailing ships loaded from Shenjiamen are continuously arriving, sufficient to supply. In this slack season of summer, the war market is tired and cannot revive. Yesterday, Haimen Pingtan charcoal was 17 yuan 8 jiao per dan, and Huangyan charcoal was 14 yuan 5 jiao. The cost of unloading at the wharf and transport by rickshaw is extra.</p>

<h3>Results of the US Citizen Opinion Test: Shanghai Can Be Kept Neutral; Even If the US Joins the War, Shanghai Will Not Be Affected; Japan's Attitude is Hesitant and Has No Determination to Start a War</h3>
<p>According to a recent public opinion test of American citizens initiated by a certain Western newspaper in this city, the result is that the United States joining the war in the near future is inevitable, but Shanghai will not be affected. American citizens unanimously agreed with the speeches of US Secretary of War Stimson and Democratic Congressman Pepper, believing that such remarks are the consistent policy of the United States, and the general opinion is that the United States has already participated in the war.</p>
<p>US-Japan Relations Will Not Become More Tense</p>
<p>According to Dr. Mingsite, the president of Zhijiang University, such remarks are nothing more than to make the American people understand the current situation and cope with it. A small number of American citizens believe that Shanghai and the coastal areas of China will be affected by the United States' participation in the war, but the majority opinion is not, and they all believe that US-Japan relations will not become more tense. Because the United States will concentrate its attention on the Atlantic, and its current two-ocean navy does not yet have the complete strength of each, the United States is not willing to immediately launch a war in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Everyone Believes That There is No Need to Panic About the Status Quo</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, they have repeatedly used threats and inducements against the United States, but Japan is still hesitant about the issue of starting a war with the United States. A small number of American citizens believe that the United States' participation in the war will cause the coastal areas of China to be blockaded. An official of a US consulate stated his personal opinion that American citizens here are no longer able to enjoy real protection, so he believes that their optimism is not credible. However, the remarks made by Stimson and others did not imply that American citizens should leave China immediately, and most officials here said that there is no need to panic about the status quo, because they have not received any alarming news.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Neutrality Benefits Each Other</p>
<p>General American citizens such as the famous lawyer Alerman and the former Chairman of the Municipal Council Fankeling, etc., decided to stay here. Fan said that Shanghai will become a neutral zone, and Shanghai should maintain this neutral position, because if Shanghai is bombed, it will be of no benefit to both belligerents. If Shanghai can remain neutral, the commerce of both belligerents can continue to be maintained.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Steamer Northern Route Ticket Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The Taikoo Steamer Company's Northern Route ships, which run between Shanghai and Tianjin, passing through Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai and other ports, will implement a fare increase from the 15th of this month. The official cabin from Shanghai to Qingdao will be 55 yuan, the stateroom will be 45 yuan, the bunk will be 35 yuan, and the third class will be 20 yuan. The official cabin from Shanghai to Weihaiwei will be 65 yuan, the stateroom will be 50 yuan, the bunk will be 40 yuan, and the third class will be 27 yuan.

<h3>French Concession Cleaning Workers Resumed Work Yesterday Morning; Wages During Strike Period Approved for Back Pay; Arrested Workers to Be Released with Leniency</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council employs a total of 1,700 cleaning workers, of whom 388 are responsible for clearing garbage within the concession. After a strike at the end of last month, workers went on strike again at the beginning of this month due to deductions from their wages for the strike period.</p>
<p>Cleaning Workers Obey Advice</p>
<p>The Municipal Council believed that since summer had arrived and garbage workers' prolonged strike was greatly affecting sanitation within the concession, it contacted relevant parties and decided to advise the workers to resume work first. Regarding the deduction of wages during the previous strike period, the Council agreed to pay them. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, 55 arrested workers were completely released. At the same time, workers were advised to resume work first. After this advice, all garbage workers gradually began to resume work from 8:00 AM yesterday morning. All 200+ White Russian workers hired by the Council as replacements were dismissed yesterday afternoon. After resuming work, the workers immediately drove out to clear accumulated garbage within the concession.</p>
<p>French Laundries and Dyeing Shops Still Not Open</p>
<p>Since the entire workforce of French laundries and dyeing shops launched a strike on the 4th of this month, the French Laundry and Dyeing Shops Guild, fearing unexpected incidents, sent personnel the day before yesterday to advise each shop to suspend business temporarily and await resolution. The workers' demands to management include thirteen items. Management has only agreed to a 30% pay raise. It is learned that labor and management each sent representatives to a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss the proposed demands further. If both sides can negotiate sincerely, the labor dispute can be resolved within days. Management, due to rampant rumors in recent days and continued fears of unexpected incidents, has requested protection from the police.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Remains in Chongqing, Will Go to Chengdu for Inspection</p>
<p>Since leaving Shanghai and flying to Chongqing, Mr. Yu Qiaqing has paid his respects to important officials of the National Government and visited former Shanghai industrialists such as Liu Hongsheng. It is understood that he is currently discussing methods for transferring Shanghai inland capital and assisting the government in developing the inland region. Mr. Yu intends to go to Chengdu to negotiate business in the coming days and will stay there for several days.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Procuring Vietnamese Rice: Over 20,000 Tons per Month; Rice Stored in All Warehouses Not Allowed to Leave the City; First Batch of Hong Kong Rice May Arrive Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department of the International Settlement, in order to prevent the smuggling of rice to other areas, had previously announced that anyone wishing to transport rice out of the International Settlement, whether it was native rice or foreign rice, must apply for a permit from the General Office of the Department at 209 Jiangxi Road. Without first obtaining a permit, rice could not be transported out of the International Settlement. It is learned that both authorities, in anticipation of possible problems, have stipulated that rice already transported to the city, whether stored in Pudong, Hongkou, or the central district, cannot be freely transported to other areas. If discovered, it will be treated as smuggling and will be investigated and dealt with according to the law as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Will Continue to Fall This Week</p>
<p>The first batch of rice from Hong Kong transported by the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, totaling 5,000 tons, may arrive here on Saturday or Sunday. It will be sold at a price of 110 yuan per shi. The news of the impending arrival of Hong Kong rice caused rice prices to fall another five or six yuan this morning (8th), totaling more than 35 yuan in the last four days. Rice speculators are increasingly fearful of the actions taken by the Settlement authorities. The general public firmly believes that rice prices will fall sharply again within the week.</p>
<p>French Municipal Council's Rice Transportation Plan</p>
<p>According to this morning's news, the French Concession Municipal Council's plan to transport rice from Vietnam to Shanghai may be completed tomorrow (9th). The exact amount of Vietnamese rice transported by the French authorities is not known, but it is widely believed to be 25,000 tons per month, similar to the amount transported by the Public Works Department. It is heard that preparations for retail rice shops to sell the first batch of Hong Kong rice have been completed, and citizens can directly purchase Hong Kong rice according to the restrictions set by the Public Works Department, but resale is prohibited to prevent speculators from profiting from it.</p>
<p>Profits Are Generous for Selling Hong Kong Rice</p>
<p>It is heard that the price at which the authorities sell the low-priced Hong Kong rice to rice merchants is 122.91 yuan per bag. Rice merchants sell it to rice shops for 133.50 yuan, so rice merchants make a profit of 10.59 yuan per bag. Rice shops sell it to citizens at a price of 110 yuan per shi, so they can make a profit of 3.20 yuan per bag, which is 1.20 yuan higher than the legal commission of 2 yuan per shi decided by the Rice Shop Guild. If rice shops order from rice merchants, rice merchants must make up for any shortage in the weight of each bag. If rice shops order directly from the Liki Foreign Firm, the minimum order is 500 bags. Now, most rice merchants and rice shops in the city are happy to sell it because the authorities have given them generous profits.</p>
<p>Rice Prices at All Levels Continue to Fall</p>
<p>After the rice market opened yesterday, rice prices at all levels continued to fall by five or six yuan per shi because rice merchants were competing to purchase the low-priced Hong Kong rice organized by the authorities, and rice shops also stopped purchasing because Hong Kong rice was about to arrive in Shanghai. Only a small number of rice shops with empty stocks purchased a little, but the total amount was only over 4,000 bags. Saigon No. 1 rice fell from 138 yuan per shi to 133 yuan. Xiaojiao rice fell from 130 yuan to 123-124 yuan. It is expected that this unreasonable rice price will continue to fall to the reasonable price of 110 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspaper Infers Response Policy</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-based *North-China Daily News* published an editorial attacking Shanghai's black-hearted rice merchants on the 27th of last month, it published another article yesterday, stating briefly that since the Public Works Department announced that it would soon transport rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai for sale to residents of the city at a fair price, rice prices have fallen sharply in recent days. According to the latest issue of the *Hong Kong Weekly*, the price of rice has risen sharply, and the price of rice has been out of touch with market conditions. On the 18th of last month, the wholesale price of Saigon rice with 25% broken rice was 14.32 Hong Kong dollars per dan, or only 68 legal currency, but the Shanghai market price reached 156 legal currency. With a profit of 88 yuan per dan of rice, isn't this kind of transaction beyond common sense? In the past, the general public in the city have made suggestions to the authorities, but at that time the countermeasures proposed by the authorities were too costly, or they said that they had no right to deal with them, and speculators even further displayed their magic hands, so the rice market became more and more chaotic, and prices jumped by dozens of yuan every day. The general public felt that if this continued, they would have no choice but to take risks. Now, the Public Works Department has spent a lot of money to implement the rice purchase plan, which is an unnecessary increase in expenditure, but it is better late than never. It is generally believed that Shanghai is currently in an extraordinary period, and the authorities should deal with all problems with extraordinary measures. It is deeply hoped that the authorities will not be constrained by past rules and regulations in the future, and that all problems should be handled with rapid and resolute means.</p>
<h3>US Navy YMCA Secretary, Henson, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Rudy C. Hanson, executive secretary of the National Association of the US Army and Navy YMCA in New York, arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the President Taft and will serve as the executive secretary of the US Navy YMCA in the city. According to Mr. Henson, although this is his first time in Shanghai, he has heard a lot about China in the United States, so he hopes to obtain more materials during his four-year term in the future. Mr. Henson brought no fewer than five cameras when he arrived in Shanghai yesterday, which shows where his interests lie. When the reporter asked Mr. Henson about American public opinion, he said that he did not want to talk about political issues, because he came to Shanghai specifically to work for the Navy YMCA and did not want to ask about politics. Mr. Henson is a Dane who later became an American citizen and has served in the US Army and Navy YMCA for 22 years. His footprints have almost traveled all over Europe and the Far East. In 1922, he was sent to China to serve. At that time, he felt that he was too young to serve in a country with a long culture. Now his position is slightly better than before.</p>
<h3>Fujian Meteorological Bureau to Host Observation of Total Solar Eclipse</h3>
<p>The total solar eclipse on September 21st of this year will pass through most areas of our country. Fujian is the clearest place to observe it. The provincial meteorological bureau has prepared everything and is hosting observers from all over the world, providing various observation conveniences. The observation locations have been set in Chong'an, Jian'ou, Zhenghe, Fu'an, Xiapu, and other counties.</p>
<h3>Capital Inflow: Over 500 Million Yuan This Year; Financial Circles to Establish Two Banks</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the amount of money remitted from Shanghai to the inland has increased sharply. From January to the end of April, the total amount has exceeded 500 million yuan. Moreover, the amount handled by commercial firms is not included, which is enough to supplement the shortage of inland capital and make the inland financial circles active. Inland banks have uniformly increased interest rates, while Shanghai banks have reduced interest rates, causing Shanghai capital to continue to flow inland. It is heard that Shanghai financial circles are planning to establish Jianguo and Jianhua banks, with headquarters in Chongqing and capital of 2 million yuan each, which is completely invested by Shanghai financial circles. It is also heard that a number of national goods factories have selected sites in the inland and are preparing to start construction, including papermaking, wool weaving, dyeing, spinning, and ink industries. The machinery has been transported to the inland one after another.</p>
<h3>Today is May 9th: Commemoration; All Circles Strive for Progress</h3>
<p>Today is May 9th Commemoration Day. Since the "July 7th" Incident, the central government has stipulated "July 7th" as the War Commemoration Day. As for May 9th, it has been officially abolished. All circles of the city also believe that the environment is special and do not want to overspend. They only commemorate it by stopping entertainment and banquets, and at the same time swear to cultivate strength, teach lessons, and have the spirit of perseverance to strive for progress, strive for freedom and liberation, and national survival. The Settlement authorities will also implement stricter precautions for one day to ensure safety.</p>
<h3>Jewish Refugees Come to Shanghai to Flee; A Czech Woman Commits Suicide by Drowning; Ship Searches for Four Hours Without Success; Possibly Committed Suicide Because of Difficulty Obtaining Landing Permit</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reported that the Japanese ship Taiyo Maru arrived here from Japan this morning (8th), carrying eight Jewish refugees. There were originally nine Jewish refugees on the ship. One of them, a Czech refugee woman named Grant, 27 years old, escaped the horrors of the Nazis from Prague, Czech Republic, and arrived in Japan after three months and boarded the Taiyo Maru to Shanghai. But yesterday (7th) at around 9:30 AM, after the woman finished breakfast on the ship, she suddenly committed suicide by drowning. The crew heard the news and stopped the ship for about four hours to search, but they did not see the woman's trace, so they continued to sail. According to Jewish officials, Grant had a permit to land in the International Settlement. The reason for her suicide may be because she did not have a Japanese permit and could not enter Hongkou. It is heard that the woman and her husband encountered difficulties in Japan when they passed through Japan because they did not have the approval of the Japanese authorities. According to this morning's news, there are currently about 2,000 European Jewish refugees in Japan, most of whom come from Soviet-occupied Poland and Lithuania, waiting for approval to be able to transfer to other places to make a living. About 300 of them have been approved by the British government and will go to Palestine. The Soviet government has recently refused to allow European Jewish refugees to transit through its territory, so the number of refugees coming to Shanghai in the future will be reduced.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Must Be Stabilized by Prohibiting Resale of Warehouse Receipts</h3>
<p>The number of coal-carrying ships will gradually increase, and the source of coal will become more and more abundant in the future. There is no concern for interruption. Moreover, there is a large amount of coal in storage and the amount used is decreasing. According to the actual situation, the market price of flue-cured white coal should gradually fall, and the general chaotic situation seems to be disappearing. However, contrary to expectations, in the midst of abundant storage and smooth sources, the market price has not only not fallen, but has continued to be firm, which is unexpected. Throughout the day, the supply of spot goods in the coal market is not only insufficient, but short-term and long-term warehouse receipts are also lacking. Cargo owners, believing that goods are scarce and valuable, are unwilling to easily supply the market and are waiting for a good price to sell, so the entire coal market is difficult to ease and the general public is still quite firm. In order to find out the inside story, the reporter specifically inquired from various coal industry groups yesterday. According to reports, the city's major coal companies have repeatedly refused to supply the market on the grounds that coal storage is insufficient, and on the one hand, they have not made efforts to recover the warehouse receipts that have been issued, citing that the holders of the receipts refused to deliver the goods. However, they still do not strictly limit the issuance of warehouse receipts, so the market has become a general abnormal transaction. The so-called spot goods are still hidden, and the issued warehouse receipts are still in the hands of speculative coal merchants. These people hold these warehouse receipts to activate the market and take the opportunity to create rumors and raise prices. According to various coal industry groups, it is hoped that the two Settlement authorities will take the following measures as soon as possible: (1) Order major coal companies not to hide spot goods and should supply and sell them to the market separately, otherwise they will be severely punished for hoarding and speculating. (2) Strictly implement the delivery of goods according to the schedule of the warehouse receipts and do not refuse them for any reason. If they violate this rule, their original effectiveness will be cancelled. (3) There should be strict restrictions on the issuance of warehouse receipts, and the original holder of the receipt should be the deliverer to prevent the malpractice of reselling.</p>
<h3>It is Said That the Shunli Ship Will Sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line</h3>
<p>Since a Japanese ship arrived in Shanghai from the Jiangbei bank of Ningbo last month, there have been no more ships coming to Shanghai. Yesterday, it was learned that there is a Shunli ship that regularly sails on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and also serves Wan Shipu and other ports. It is heard that the ship has been scheduled to sail from Shanghai for the first time on the 12th of this month, with one sailing every six days. However, the steerage ticket must be sold for 48 yuan. According to general expectations, since Ningbo was occupied, the market has not returned to normal, and the original residents living in the urban area have not returned to the city, so there must be very few passengers coming and going. As for cargo transportation, it is even more impossible to transport goods because the market has not returned to normal. Therefore, it is not easy to restore the original situation of the shipping business.</p>
<h3>US Star Ship Brings 280,000 Bags of Flour</h3>
<p>The cargo ship US Star, operated by Moller Line, arrived in Shanghai from Portland, USA, via Japan at 7:00 AM this morning and berthed at the Pudong Gonghexiang Wharf. The ship carried 280,000 bags of flour, which will be unloaded here. The US cargo ship Areva, managed by Fjell Line, left Shanghai after its maiden voyage from Seattle, USA, after staying for three days, and is scheduled to load 200+ goods and leave Shanghai this morning, taking the route to Hong Kong and Manila, and then returning to Seattle along the original route.</p>

<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reported that the Public Utilities Committee and members of the committee will hold their first meeting early next week and will decide whether to approve fare increases for the four major public utilities companies in the International Settlement. Two of the four companies have already applied for considerable fare increases, and the remaining two companies also intend to adjust current prices to cope with rising expenses. It is not clear exactly how much the fare increase is requested, but it is widely believed that the British-owned Tram and Bus Company are seeking a 15% increase in current prices. The new members of the Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Department are Arnhold, Carrigan, Liu Shifang, Mitchell, Powell, D.T. Hsiao, Krone, Yajima, Shao Jiaohua, and Zhao Chuanding.</p>
<h3>Municipal Ferry Parts Continue to Be Taken</h3>
<p>When the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau evacuated after the August 13th Incident in 1937, it stored more than ten boxes of engine parts of the Shanghai Municipal Ferry in the Jianye Lane of Fuli Road, French Concession. Last year, the Japanese side twice moved some of these parts away, and there were still five or six boxes left, which were still stored in the original place. It is learned that on the 6th of this month, the Japanese side sent military trucks to move all the remaining parts away and transport them to Hongkou.</p>

<p>The US mail ship President Taft resumed round-trip voyages to this city and entered Wusongkou at 12:25 PM yesterday (1:25 PM new time). It was scheduled to dock at buoy No. 12 on the Yangshupu Pujiang surface. According to the scheduled arrival time, it was two hours late. The reason for the delay was the influence of heavy fog on the sea. Therefore, the departure time from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Luzon has also been changed to 8:00 AM tomorrow (10th). The company's last small boat for passengers has been changed to depart from the new customs wharf at 1:00 AM tonight (i.e., 1:00 AM tomorrow morning). However, since it is already curfew time, passengers can board the ship earlier on the 9:00 PM small boat tonight.</p>
<p>Mail Ships to Japan Only Stop at Kobe</p>
<p>The number of passengers disembarking in Shanghai on this ship was 7 in first and second class, 15 in third class, totaling 22 people. The number of passengers on the original ship who passed through Shanghai to Nanyang was 60 in first and second class, 215 in third class, totaling 275 people. The President Pierce mail ship departed Shanghai at 7:00 PM last night as scheduled, sailed directly to Kobe, and then directly to Honolulu, passing through San Francisco and returning to Los Angeles. All President mail ships will resume round-trip voyages in the future. The next ship, President Cleveland, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the US on the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3>Swindling Money by Claiming to Ship Pig Bristles</h3>
<p>Wang Xunmei, a native of Wuxi, has been in the pig bristle business recently. He has 421.5 catties of pig bristles worth 17,000 yuan stored in Jiangbei. Because this item is subject to the prohibition, it cannot be transported to Shanghai. There was a person from Zhenjiang named Lu Zhongyi, who claimed that his brother was the manager of the Japanese-owned Da Ya Company at No. 611 Jialing Building, Sichuan Road, and that he could guarantee its transport to Shanghai. So on March 8, Wang signed a contract with the Da Ya Company, and at that time Wang paid a shipping fee of more than 3,400 yuan. Wang then started shipping on March 13, but the entire shipment was confiscated by the customs. Wang then hired a lawyer to negotiate with the Da Ya Company, but the Japanese in Da Ya replied that they did not know about this matter and that the contract was forged. Wang then reported to the Central Police Station, and Chinese Detective Sun Minchang arrested Lu. After he confessed, he also arrested the accomplices Zhang Bailin and Liu Changjun. They were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Fang Fushu requested permission to detain them because the case had not been fully investigated. After being questioned by Judge Meng, he ordered them to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Two Young Sisters Steal Cheongsam Fabric; Conceal It in Coats to Escape; Discovered; Girl Steals Stockings in the Da Xin Company</h3>
<p>Two fashionable young women from Beijing, Wang Xiuzhen (18 years old) and Wang Xiuqin (17 years old), sisters, who lived at No. 9, Alley 48, Rue Dupleix, French Concession, went to Yunshang Fashion Company at No. 5 Hualong Road (intersection of Avenue Joffre) at 5:00 PM yesterday, pretending to buy new clothes. They stole three pieces of top-grade cheongsam fabric worth more than 100 yuan and hid the stolen goods in their coats to escape. They were discovered by the shop owner, Guo Rongpin, who called the police. The two women were searched and the stolen goods were found on them. They were taken to the police station together. Yesterday, detectives investigated whether the two women had committed other crimes before proceeding with the handling of the case.</p>
<p>At about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a fashionable young woman in the stocking department of the Da Xin Company on Nanjing Road took advantage of the clerk's inattention and stole four pairs of long stockings and several handkerchiefs. She was spotted by an inspector from the company, who arrested her and sent her to the Lao Zha Police Station for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Tram Conductor Colludes in Pickpocketing, Passenger Reports Arrest</h3>
<p>Shi Xinsheng, a local resident of Shenjiazhai in Longhua, Xixiang, thirty years old, a cotton merchant, came to Shanghai on the morning of the 5th of this month. He received 190 yuan in payment for goods. At the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao on Avenue Edward VII, he boarded a French tram line 2, intending to return to Longhua. Unexpectedly, after getting on the tram, the passengers were very crowded, and he immediately realized that the wallet and banknotes he was carrying had been pickpocketed. At that moment, the tram was moving, and several people squeezed out of the car, asking the ticket seller Du Delian, number 690, to open the door to get off. At that time, Shi also squeezed out to chase after them, but was stopped by Du, who claimed that Shi had not bought a ticket and did not allow him to get off. At the same time, Du actually took the key to open the car door and let the pickpocket thieves get off and escape. Shi believed that Du was in collusion with the thieves and disturbed the passengers and merchants. He reported this to the French Concession police, requesting an investigation. After receiving the report, the police chief dispatched detectives yesterday to arrest Du Delian, ticket seller of the French tram number 690, and then pursued the pickpocket thieves who were at large for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Recruitment of Russian Émigré Volunteers, Shanghai British Consulate Denies</p>
<p>The Shanghai Far Eastern Times reported on the 6th that the British government authorities are currently recruiting Russian émigré volunteers in Shanghai to send them to Europe to participate in the war. Yesterday, a reporter from Daguang News Agency specifically inquired with the British Consulate General in Shanghai. It was stated that the British government authorities in Shanghai, in addition to handling the registration of British émigré volunteers, have absolutely not recruited Russian émigré volunteers, and there is no such plan. The report is entirely unfounded.</p>
<h3>Fire at Baoshan Road Railway Depot Yesterday Morning, Heavy Losses of Flammable Materials Stored Inside, China Table Tennis Factory Also Careless Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Da Mei Evening News," the Japanese Shanghai Railway Depot located at the intersection of Jiaotong Road and Baoshan Road in Zhabei suddenly caught fire at 1:54 AM today (the 8th). Instantly, raging flames soared, causing heavy damage to the goods stored inside. The depot occupies an area of approximately 75 feet wide and 100 feet long, storing a large quantity of</p>
<p>Flammable Materials</p>
<p>such as cosmetics, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, kerosene, rubber tires, automobiles, cloth, and silk. Upon receiving the report, the Hongkou Fire Brigade immediately dispatched two fire trucks to extinguish the fire. However, the firefighters did not know where the fire had started because the fire alarm did not specify it. It was not until 3:07 AM that they discovered the location of the fire and rushed to the scene, finding that the depot was a two-story building. Then they</p>
<p>Broke Down the Doors</p>
<p>and did their best to extinguish the fire, finally controlling the fire. However, the roof had collapsed, and the losses were quite heavy. At the same time, the Chinese Table Tennis Factory at the intersection of Beijiangxi Road and Bazilu also caught fire, presumably due to the workers overheating the celluloid while drying it. Upon hearing the news, the Hongkou and Central Fire Brigades urgently dispatched fire trucks to the burning area on the upper floor of the building. The fire was raging, and the firefighters</p>
<p>Erected Ladders</p>
<p>to extinguish the fire near the windows to prevent it from spreading to neighboring buildings. At that moment, another pile of celluloid suddenly caught fire, and the flames shot out in all directions, causing firefighter number 34 to be burned on the face and both hands. He was immediately rushed to the police hospital for treatment. The firefighters fought the flames for an hour before extinguishing the fire.</p>
<h3>Extortion of Flour Shop Owner, Offender Sentenced</h3>
<p>Pan Ruijie, the owner of Ruiji Flour Shop at 122 North Zhejiang Road, a native of Baoshan, was previously subjected to an attempted kidnapping by bandits at the entrance of the shop. In March of this year, he received threatening letters from the bandits for three consecutive letters, extorting 1.5 million yuan. It was reported that Pan was willing to pay 70,000 yuan to avoid trouble, but the leader of the case, Wang Keming, who was still at large, felt that the amount was too small. At 7:30 AM on the 24th of that month, Zheng Huili, a local Qing Communist Party member, and Li Nanlin, who was at large, took a bomb wrapped in newspaper and sneaked to the entrance of Ruiji Flour Shop. Taking advantage of an opportunity, they threw the hand-slide bomb inside. Fortunately, it did not explode. They fled from Qipu Road, but were chased and captured by the patrol detectives of the Huishi Police Station. Together with the suspects Zhang Yangsheng and Fang Jianqiu, as well as the bomb, they were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special Court. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted them for the crime of intimidation and extortion, requesting investigation. Zhang and Fang were released without further interrogation. After deliberation, the judge Jiang delivered a judgment yesterday morning, sentencing Zheng Lihui to six months in prison, and the bomb was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Lost Boy</h3>
<p>At around 11 AM yesterday afternoon, an unidentified boy was found near Tonghui Elementary School on Malong Road. He is about three or four years old, 36 inches tall, and only wearing a red striped foreign cloth short shirt on his upper body. He has no pants, black checkered running shoes, white socks with green trim, and a Western-style haircut. It is thought that he was deceived by bad people and had his clothes and pants stripped off. If any family members recognize him, please go to Guan Jun at No. 7, Lane 412, Beile Road to claim him.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the weather around Shandong is unstable, the wind is directionless, with localized rain or fog. Here, it will change from cloudy to overcast, with fog or showers, and whirlwinds, due to a small low-pressure system passing to the northeast. The coastal area south of Ma'anshan Island is cloudy, with fog and southeast winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the temperature in Shanghai reached a high of 83.8 and a low of 60.8. On the same day last year, the high was 74.3 and the low was 60.3.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council, Special Education Committee Issues Report (2)</h3>
<p>D. The report submitted by the Regular Education Committee in 1922. E. The adoption of the report submitted by the Education Committee in 1931 and the procedure for gradually expanding its recommendations. F. The procedure set in 1931 was revised and restricted in 1934 due to financial difficulties. G. The Special Education Committee submitted a report on foreign schools in 1937. Based on the records of discussions prior to the start of operating public schools, etc., as can be seen in the reports submitted later, the basic principles that formed the Council's education policy are as follows: A. The great benefit of appropriate educational facilities to society is fully recognized and emphasized. B. The various benefits of public schools were emphasized in comparison with private schools. This became the determining factor for the Council to focus on operating public schools in 1892. C. It is obviously unfair to set up public schools with the contributions of an entire society to benefit one part of the society while excluding other parts. Thus, the first public school for Chinese children was established in 1904, and a large expansion plan to gradually increase the number of such schools was drafted in 193 in the middle.</p>
<p>Increasing Burden</p>
<p>But on the other hand, it was initially not taken into account that the sole and common responsibility for educational facilities would be borne by the Municipal Council. It was believed that the main financial responsibility should be borne by the parents of the students, and that the Council's original intention was only to engage in the necessary measures for opening, organizing and supervising, and to provide a little financial assistance for opening. Looking back at the time when the Council took over the management of public schools, it was estimated that only 25 percent of the annual expenses would have to be borne by public funds. At the beginning of the establishment of the first public school for Chinese children, it was expected that the expenses could be self-sufficient within one or two years after its establishment. However, the previous assumptions were not realized. In the years before 1911, the Council bore 50 percent of the expenses of public schools. As of 1940, the proportion of total expenses for the entire educational organization had increased to 8 percent. The 1941 annual budget still needs to be</p>
<p>Plans Reduced</p>
<p>The Council's responsibility for educational facilities should be limited, as was solemnly stated in the reports of the 1911 and 1922 committees. Since that year, due to the slow increase in the expenses of public schools, there have been various opinions. Some have proposed adopting an "expansionist" education policy, while others, in view of the difficult financial reality, believe that this method will place an excessively heavy and unfair burden on the entire society. As for the strong reasons in favor of the former, it is unfair that some resident groups do not receive balanced benefits from the Council's educational expenses. Therefore, in 1931, it was decided to find a way to correct this inequality in the plan to gradually increase the number of Chinese children's schools. At that time, the Council had ample financial resources due to the transfer of the electrical part of its industry, and the previous expansion plan could be implemented. In 1934, the Council once again encountered economic problems, and it became necessary to severely reduce this plan. Shi Jing decided that the annual education expenses should not exceed the income equivalent to two percent of the total property tax collection rate. At the same time, it was decided to temporarily not add any more public schools.</p>
<p>Encourage Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The committee discussing Western children's schools in 1937 reconsidered the financial issue. For economic reasons, and at the same time to make the allocation of educational expenses more fair, it was recommended that the Council expand the subsidy method, encourage overseas Chinese to set up their own schools, and strictly limit the direct supply of educational facilities with municipal income. In addition, it was proposed to transfer two public schools to overseas Chinese groups for management, thereby reducing the number of public schools.</p>
<p>Formulate Policy</p>
<p>The above discussion is for historical background. The original intention of this committee in formulating the first step of work was to explore the definition of the responsibilities borne by the Municipal Council and resident groups of various countries in the field of education. This issue has been carefully reviewed and a unanimous understanding has been reached as follows:</p>
<p>A. Educational facilities, from the perspective of the welfare of the entire society, are appropriate and necessary, and the Municipal Council must pay attention to this. B. The existing Municipal Council schools maintain a high degree of efficiency, at least as good as, or far better than, the schools supported by overseas Chinese groups and independent groups. In addition, the standards established by the Bureau's schools are exemplary. In terms of political theory, educational facilities are the responsibility of the state, in other words, they belong to independent and autonomous political organizations of the same race. The autonomy of the Public Concession is obtained with the consent of the countries concerned. It is neither an independent institution nor a political organization of the same race. Therefore, this responsibility should first be attributed to overseas Chinese groups in various countries.</p>
<p>Secondly, in practice, if a complete municipal education is to be directly implemented for the schoolchildren of an entire society, it is limited by economic constraints and is impossible. This is because the number of schoolchildren is large, the languages are different, and the cultural and political backgrounds of overseas Chinese groups in various countries are also different. This situation makes educational facilities different from other municipal facilities, such as public health, public works, fire prevention, etc., because the latter can have a single and common facility to benefit taxpayers regardless of their nationality. Based on the above, the committee reached a conclusion that the Bureau's responsibility in education should be limited to encouraging and assisting the education groups of overseas Chinese groups, and limiting direct municipal education facilities to a certain scope. This scope shows that due to several specific reasons (such as the smallness, poverty, and lack of organization of any group, etc.), there is no other way to choose other than direct education facilities. In addition, the Municipal Council's responsibility should be limited to certain special educational facilities, such as setting up vocational or technical training classes, etc.</p>
<p>The resolution passed by this committee is as follows: "The responsibility for education in the Public Concession belongs first to the overseas Chinese groups in various countries, and second to the Municipal Council." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Teachers of Three Schools Successively Request Allowances, Yongguang Started Going on Strike Yesterday, Remaining Two Schools are Peizhi and Jingzhi</h3>
<p>Teachers and staff of Peizhi Elementary School on Klenener Road and Yongguang Elementary School on Carter Road have also recently requested their schools to increase their salaries. The former has already submitted a request to the educational authorities for mediation, and personnel have been sent to properly verify and handle it, hoping to obtain a solution. The latter has already started to go on strike yesterday, and relevant parties will send personnel to mediate today. A reporter from Guanghua News Agency recorded the requests made by the teachers and staff of Yongguang Elementary School as follows: 1. A monthly living allowance of 30 yuan will be issued, starting from February of this year. 2. Salaries will be calculated on a six-month basis. 3. Advance compensation of 15 yuan per person per month for educational assistance. 4. The duties of teachers in the next semester will be performed as stipulated in this semester. 5. Employment letters for the next semester will be issued one month before the summer vacation. 6. The school's finances will be absolutely transparent. 7. The school shall not take unfriendly measures against teachers.</p>
<p>Another report states that the teachers and staff of Jinghua Middle School and Elementary School on Haifang Road also requested the school's Standing Committee to subsidize living expenses yesterday. It is said that the principal is considering it.</p>
<p>The Problem of Xin Huan's Employment Letters Has Not Yet Been Resolved. Although the strike at the Second Private Xin Huan Elementary School has been resolved through the mediation of relevant parties, and the salary portion has been resolved first, the teachers and staff are also well aware of the overall situation and have resumed teaching first. However, the issue of when to issue employment letters is still deadlocked. A statement was issued by the teachers and staff yesterday, saying that</p>
<h3>Orphanage Calligraphy and Painting Charity Sale, Zhu Rongzhuang Donates 100 Paintings</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Orphanage in Longhua was founded by Gao Hanqing and the late scholar and gentleman Wang Yiting. It has a long history and outstanding achievements. After the Shanghai war, it moved into the French Concession Mengjiang Hall to continue teaching and nurturing. There are currently more than 100 orphans, who are provided with food and clothing free of charge. At a time when everything is expensive, it is not easy to maintain. Therefore, Ye Erkai, Ji Juemi, Yuan Xilian, Zhu Rongzhuang, Xu Lianfu and other friends of Wang Gong's life initiated a charity sale of calligraphy and paintings at the Ningbo Fellow Association. Zhu Rongzhuang alone contributed 100 masterpieces, all of which were exquisitely decorated, costing thousands of yuan, and all of which were donated. His benevolence and righteousness are unprecedented. It closed the day before yesterday (the 7th) and was very fruitful. It is reported that the orphanage will publish a notice in the newspaper to express its gratitude for the results of this charity sale in the near future, so as to show great trust.</p>

<h3>The Destiny of the Child — Before Parents' Day</h3>
<p>— Pei Ling</p>
<p>After the factory smoke stack exhaled its last cloud of thick smoke, the setting sun had lost its brilliance. Xiao Jin ran out of the factory gate in a hurry, carrying a meal basket, and rushed to someone three steps ahead, but was stopped:</p>
<p>"What's the hurry? You!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Sorry, haha, let me tell you, my wife is about to give birth!"</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Who's making it up? This morning when I came, her belly was a little sore, presumably she must be giving birth now!" Xiao Jin's mouth still had a very real smile.</p>
<p>"Then, congratulations, you're going to be a father, good luck, haha!" He patted Xiao Jin's shoulder with envy and amusement.</p>
<p>"Haha!" It seemed that every piece of meat on Xiao Jin's face was smiling.</p>
<p>He soon arrived home. As soon as he entered the door, when a cry of an infant entered his ears, Xiao Jin's heart couldn't help but beat faster. He was really going to be a father. He felt a joy that he had never experienced before.</p>
<p>His wife was lying on the bed groaning, her head still covered in sweat. The child was sleeping next to her, a lovely little face with reddish-purple pores and yellow hair. Xiao Jin thought it was better than any other child.</p>
<p>"Boy or girl?" he asked earnestly.</p>
<p>"Son!" his wife smiled.</p>
<p>"Really?" Although he knew that she wouldn't be lying.</p>
<p>"But, Jin! I have a few words to say to you!" his wife paused for a moment, looking up: "I've been thinking about it for a long time, and I feel like I have to take this path, rice is so expensive, it's really hard to live, it's really hard to raise a child, alas! This is not a good thing, who would want this?"</p>
<p>His wife was exhausted from so much talking and gasped for air.</p>
<p>Silence</p>
<p>The child was fast asleep, the muscles moving up and down; sometimes he would move his body, but he would fall asleep again immediately.</p>
<p>"Then what are you saying?" Xiao Jin's trembling voice broke the silence.</p>
<p>"I say... I'm afraid you won't want to, you definitely won't want to, alas! Who would want to? There's no way! I say... — throw him away!"</p>
<p>"What? Throw him away!" like lightning stirred in front of the broken bed.</p>
<p>Another long period of silence.</p>
<p>"I can't!" — a resolute voice.</p>
<p>"Can't?" his wife smiled bitterly: "Can you afford to raise him?"</p>
<p>This hit Xiao Jin very hard. All the happy fantasies he had on the road were suddenly destroyed, and everything was dark in front of him. He sat down slumped, lowering his head as if a child had received a scolding.</p>
<p>— His wife was right, now, the combined wages of the two of them were not enough for a month's expenses, and they were in debt of twenty or thirty yuan every month. How could they add another child? Besides, his wife didn't have good food, so how could she have breast milk, wouldn't he starve to death! Starve to death! Both of them went to work during the day, who would take care of the child? Hire a nanny? Ugh! Dream on! Where would the money come from?</p>
<p>Thinking of money, he immediately thought of the only little property under the pillow, not even enough to buy two liters of rice, how could he support a child?</p>
<p>Money! Child! Rice! Breast milk! Money!</p>
<p>Xiao Jin's head was dizzy, he couldn't see anything, he seemed to see a child being thrown in the wilderness, a pack of wild dogs sniffing and gnawing, his hands gnawed off, his legs... his head...</p>
<p>Child! That was his child!</p>
<p>"I can't!" he suddenly stood up.</p>
<p>"Think about it carefully!" his wife said in a pleading tone.</p>
<p>"Alas! I can't think, ... how can you bear it, can you bear to have your child eaten by wild dogs?" he raised his voice.</p>
<p>"There's no way! I can only blame him for having a bad life and being born into our poor family! Alas!..." his wife shed tears, but wiped them away immediately: "Jin! Listen to me, go throw him away! There are many days to come! I'll let you be a father again!" The last sentence was clearly to comfort himself and Xiao Jin.</p>
<p>"Could it be that I really don't have the blessing to be a father? Won't you let yourself be a mother?" Xiao Jin stared blankly at the child, who was still sleeping.</p>
<p>"What childish words!" his wife smiled bitterly: "Send him out quickly! There will be many days to come! I'll let you be a father!"</p>
<p>"Alas! Child! Why were you born into my family!" He suddenly made up his mind and picked up the child, staggering out.</p>
<h3>Singing of the Empty City on an Empty Stomach</h3>
<p>— Written by Xinghuo</p>
<h3>Pitiful?</h3>
<p>— Juehui</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Shanghai's hoarding rice merchants are as venomous as snakes and scorpions, as greedy as tigers and wolves." In fact, Shanghai's hoarding rice merchants are also quite "pitiful."</p>
<p>Pitiful can be divided into several types: like starving to death; like living worse than death; like being unable to "afford" to live or die... But our hoarding rice merchants are to be "pitied" ten million times more than these people. Why? Because the most pitiful people in the world are those who "do not wake up until death"!</p>
<p>Moreover, "you" don't understand "us"!</p>
<p>For example, the Shanghai Municipal Council entrusts rice to be sold. A good "lofty saying" that "entrusting the transfer to merchants will only increase costs. It is better for rice shops to directly purchase and sell, so that food households can receive more benefits." However, everyone regards it as a despicable saying that has lost all conscience. Is there anything more "pitiful" than this in the world?</p>
<p>No one "understands," and they don't wake up until death. Therefore, "rice weevils" become complete "pitiable insects"!</p>
<p>But are they pitiful? They are still "insects" after all, and they are still "worthy of death."</p>
<h3>Autumn Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(7) A Cross Drawn on the Face</p>
<p>"Seventh Brother, don't be so rash!" Governor Hu's intention was originally to plead for Qiu Haitang at Shao Wen's request. Unexpectedly, Qiu Haitang had already been so cruelly harmed by them, and Shao Wen's rage had reached the point where he was about to fight his uncle. He had no choice but to change his tune and plead for Yuan Bin Fan instead. "In this matter, ethically speaking, old brother, you were too reckless! By ruining him like this, isn't it even worse than death?"</p>
<p>Yuan Bin Fan did not expect that this nephew of his would become so furious. Moreover, he couldn't forget how mischievous he was when he was young, squandering his family fortune and nearly starving to death several times, all thanks to his elder brother's help. Later, he gradually prospered, starting as a common soldier. His elder brother also became a prominent figure in politics and repeatedly pleaded and lobbied for him, enabling him to rise step by step, until his death, without him ever repaying his kindness. Therefore, in good conscience, he had to treat Shao Wen particularly well. Besides, in recent years, which matter hadn't Shao Wen handled wholeheartedly for him?</p>
<p>"Third Brother, it's a pity you came too late. Now, even if I want to regret it, it's too late!" He said in an unusually gentle voice, "But, Third Brother and Seventh Brother, you wouldn't want me to be a cuckold, would you?"</p>
<p>"How can you say such things, you slave!" Shao Wen still said, consumed with rage.</p>
<p>"But he fainted as soon as he saw that mute's corpse, which isn't what those slaves said, is it? And he later broke off relations with me himself, openly. These people all fully acknowledge it." He pointed his right hand towards the servants nearby. "Seventh Brother, good boy, even I, as a garrison commander, need to save some face, don't I? If you don't believe me, you can ask them!"</p>
<p>Shao Wen's anger subsided slightly then.</p>
<p>"The person isn't dead?" Governor Hu turned his head to look at the unconscious Qiu Haitang, asking without much concern.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Shao Wen, however, did not pay attention to their questions and answers. (101)</p>
<h3>A Group That "Eats by the Grace of Heaven"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Ken</p>
<p>The Chinese interpretation of the phrase "eat rice" (吃飯) is truly peculiar. For example, "eating foreign firm rice" (吃洋行飯), "eating beggar's rice" (吃開口飯), and "eating loafer's rice" (吃白相飯) are often used as synonyms for "occupation." And "eating by the grace of heaven" (靠天吃飯) is just one of those synonyms.</p>
<p>Old women and the like, holding prayer beads and eating vegetarian food in the name of Guanyin, naturally also call themselves "eating by the grace of heaven." However, that is not really true. What they "eat" is actually their son's or husband's "rice," and, moreover, chanting Buddha's name is not their occupation after all. I think the group that truly "eats" by "the grace of heaven" is probably no more stable than the pioneers.</p>
<p>The other day, I passed by some unnamed "temple." Although it was brightly lit with candles, business seemed very slow. The monks were chanting Buddhist scriptures listlessly, not at all looking plump and well-fed. I saw in the newspaper that the monks had requested an increase in "funding," which shows that this "eating by the grace of heaven" is really difficult to swallow. Indeed, with the high pressure of rice prices at one hundred forty or fifty yuan per picul, ordinary people, except for some nouveau riche, can hardly take care of them anymore. The rice price, which is rising faster than Sun Wukong's somersault of 108,000 li, probably makes even the horizontal plaque of "Boundless Buddhist Dharma" hanging in the hall pale in comparison!</p>
<p>On the streets, one can still often see blind fortune tellers, holding children. Hitting steel bars together, they shout, "Annual fortune, monthly windfall!" However, after turning around in one or two alleys, they immediately come out again. In this day and age, who still has the thought of "having their fortune told"? I think, if those gaunt blind people had ever "had their own fortune told," they probably should have jumped into the Huangpu River long ago.</p>
<p>There are also blind people sitting in the corners of the streets, shaking the bamboo cylinder of divination sticks desperately, so anxious that sweat flows from their empty eye sockets, but still no one pays attention to them...</p>
<p>The "One Dust Masters" and the like, who understand the "divine art of struggle," still pester passersby, complaining that their complexion is not good and that they need to use "magic" to resolve it. But no one is willing to take out their wallets, so those "gods" who resemble beggars have to sigh to themselves.</p>
<p>Astrologers write signs in large red paper and post them at the door, saying it is "a year of great calamity." However, no one pays attention. If they observe the celestial phenomena at night, they must first sigh for themselves.</p>
<p>Indeed, "heaven" is about to collapse. The incense offerings to the Bodhisattvas are slowly decreasing. How can they still take care of the group that "eats by the grace of heaven"?</p>
<h3>Brushstrokes</h3>
<p>— Jun Rui</p>
<p>Those who advance are those who are good at understanding the needs of their times.</p>
<p>Those who gloat over the misfortune of others are the most indifferent, cruel, and ugly people in the world.</p>
<p>Those who evade life are the most cowardly and useless people.</p>
<p>"Honesty" is the magic weapon for gaining the trust of others; we should use it with caution.</p>
<p>To live is to struggle; do not forget that we are in struggle every day.</p>
<p>Exploiting the labor and happiness of others while enjoying the fruits of their labor is the most shameful behavior.</p>
<p>Seek happiness in work and experience life.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm without a plan is like groping in the dark.</p>
<p>Do your best to complete the work you should do in a day.</p>

<h3>Norma Shearer to Retire from the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Ying Liu</p>
<p>A Generation of Tragic Performers</p>
<p>Norma Shearer, a film actress famous for playing tragic protagonists, has been officially affiliated with MGM since September 1925, for a total of sixteen years. She has starred in more than sixty films, with "The Divorcee," "Smilin' Through," "Marie Antoinette," and "A Woman of Affairs" being the most popular with audiences at home and abroad. In June 1935, after her husband tragically died of appendicitis, Norma, feeling the sorrow of her own life, intended to retire to the company. Later, she moved back to her hometown of Longueuil, Quebec, for recuperation. However, due to the resolute retention of the company's new deputy manager, Eddie Mannix, she continued to sign a six-year contract with the company. At that time, Norma stated that her dedication to the arts was purely for the purpose of cultivating personal artistry, and declared that she was unwilling to increase her weekly salary or any year-end compensation. The company officials expressed their willingness to accept Norma's well-intentioned conditions. In the past, the large bonuses that Norma herself should have received at the end of each year were personally distributed by her and donated to charitable organizations. Therefore, people in Hollywood generally expressed deep sympathy for Norma's loyal service and enthusiasm for society. As a result, she was soon hailed as the "Virtuous Woman of the Silver Kingdom."</p>
<p>Norma Shearer has a daughter who is only twelve years old. She herself is weak and often ill. Four years ago, while playing on a swing, she unfortunately fell and broke her ankle, which has not yet recovered. Norma loves her as the apple of her eye. Since the ankle fracture occurred, she has become even more protective of her, staying with her day and night. Whenever Norma goes to the studio to film a scene, two maids accompany her daughter to take care of her, fearing that she will suffer another accident. Moreover, Norma personally teaches her daughter at home every day, not letting her go to school anymore. It is also heard that Norma's half-sister, Joan Shearer, has recently joined MGM as an actress. She made her debut in "Romeo and Juliet," and her acting skills are not weak. Moreover, her face has a few clear black spots, just like Norma, which is very eye-catching. It is reported that in Norma's recently starred "Her Cardboard Lover," her sister also assisted in the performance, and her achievements are showing greater progress. Therefore, Norma once said to people in the company: "I have exceeded the age of going to the studio to film, so I can definitely say goodbye to the silver screen life, so as not to be eliminated by the audience. Afterwards, I only hope that the company will cultivate my sister with kindness, which is my wish." The company officials have now expressed that they can fully accept her wish and will give her sister preferential treatment in order to repay Norma's loyal service to the company for more than ten years.</p>
<p>Norma's six-year contract with the company will expire in mid-August of this year. Therefore, Norma personally resigned from the company last month. Although the company officials expressed extreme regret over Norma's retirement, they knew that it was impossible to retain her in fact, so they agreed to accept it. The company also paid her seven years of compensation in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, the two films currently starring Norma, "Her Cardboard Lover" and "We Were Dancing," have been decided to be completed ahead of schedule. From then on, this tragic image will no longer be seen on the screen.</p>
<h3>Peking Opera and Shaoxing Opera</h3>
<p>— Gu Mei</p>
<p>Peking Opera evolved from Hui, Han, and Kunqu opera, while Shaoxing Opera (not the Shaoxing "Wenxi" opera falsely named by the "Duduban") is the remaining sound of Yuyao and Wenzhou Southern opera. Peking Opera reached its peak in the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, while Southern opera originated after the Southern Song Dynasty settled in Hangzhou. Historically, Shaoxing Opera is more ancient than Peking Opera; however, Peking Opera, after being offered to the imperial court and captivating officials and gentlemen, removed the dross, retained the essence, deleted the crude, and added the beautiful. In form, it has broken away from the principles of Hui, Han, and Kunqu opera, and in substance, it has lost the inherent ability of drama to subtly influence, correct customs, and change customs. It has become a thing for leisure, pleasing to the ears and eyes, and relaxing to the mind. Shaoxing has simple customs and frugal people, so Shaoxing Opera still cannot get rid of its rustic style. Big operas (martial arts operas) mostly depict loyalty and martyrdom, while small operas (literary operas) describe chastity. This is different from Peking Opera, which focuses on narrative without a central theme, such as "Empty City Stratagem," "The Pot of Injustice," "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao," "Setting Up Camp at Dingjun Mountain," "Stealing the Imperial Scroll," "Baling Bridge," "Ancient City Reunion," "Changban Slope," "Evil Tiger Village," "Jiepai Pass," "Little Shang Tomb," "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," "The Drunken Concubine," "The Pagoda Offering," "Ugly Showing Merit," "Picking Up Gold," "Black Wind Scarf," "Exploring Yin Mountain," and "Beating the Dragon Robe." After the forces of the Hui opera troupe entered eastern Zhejiang, Shaoxing Opera gradually became eliminated. In order to cater to the public, later actors also adopted and performed Hui opera scripts, such as "Dragon and Tiger Fight," "Gaoping Pass," "Yongjin Gate," "Jiepai Pass," "The Yang Family Generals," "Changban Slope," and "Borrowing Zhao Yun." In fact, Shaoxing Opera has a smaller organization than Peking Opera, and its troupe rules and opera examples are stricter than those of Peking Opera. Peking Opera martial arts students also perform martial net dramas, strongly claiming martial arts student painted face dramas, and old students can sing painted face dramas, such as Li Keyong of the Pearl Curtain Village, Wu Han of the Zhan Jing Hall, and Zhao Kuangyin of the Zhan Huang Robe. Shaoxing Opera's plain-faced characters and painted-face characters are divided by temperament. Li Keyong of the Shatuo Kingdom and Jiang Taigong of the Wei River are both painted-face. Wu Han is upright and loyal and is also painted-face. Zhao Kuangyin borrows a head (Gaoping Pass), slays Zheng (Zhan Huang Robe), hides a treacherous plan, and indulges in feminine beauty, so he is assigned a painted-face. Bao Gong is a civil official, unlike Yao Qi, who came from a military background. Shaoxing Opera troupes stipulate that he should be played by Lao Niu. However, Shaoxing Opera has too much feudal color, such as Huyan Zan in "Dragon and Tiger Fight," who is a filial son, but he is played by a clown because he is scolding the master and attacking the monarch in the play (Peking Opera uses a painted face).</p>
<p>In short, Shaoxing Opera's inflexibility is its flaw; Peking Opera's constant innovation is also a bad phenomenon. Moreover, too few plays have a moral to impart, so Shaoxing Opera's performance is more reasonable than Peking Opera.</p>

<h3>A Record of Pan Haiqiu's Death</h3>
<p>— Shu Tian</p>
<p>Haiqiu, the eldest son of the famous actor and revolutionary artist Pan Yueqiao, died last month after being arrested for opium addiction. Here is a brief history: Pan was originally from Changshu. He followed his father to perform at the New Stage in the Shanghai Nine Acres when he was young. His stage name was Little Lotus Green. Whenever he had free time, he would discuss with his uncles and fathers, so he knew many plays. He studied young male roles, and he was proficient in male, female, painted face, and clown roles. He was once popular in Hankou. Unfortunately, he became involved in the singing stage and developed bad habits. His voice became very dim. He came to Shanghai in depression and spoke to the daughter of Yi Fangshuo, Little Fangshuo, and Little Mei Yan, etc. Xi Jun, the current leader of the Peking Opera stock of the Rainbow Film Company, also sought advice from him. It has been a year since I heard any news, and I unexpectedly heard of his death from illness. For an actor to end up like this, how can one not be saddened!</p>

<h3>Abstract of the Philosophy of Diligence</h3>
<p>— Zong Yu</p>
<p>Matter exists outside of human consciousness. If you want to study material life, you must first connect matter and life, and then determine your attitude towards matter. Changing the material environment to seek the reform of consciousness is a great responsibility in life.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Falling Flowers Intend to Follow the Flowing Water</p>
<p>However, there was another matter that made him even more uneasy, because Lady He often sent a little maid to his room to deliver food to him, which was quite attentive, but it made him uneasy. One day, it was the fifteenth night, the bright moon shone on the half-wall, the shadows of flowers were mottled. At dusk, Xu Jing was reading a book under the lamp in the guest room, the door was ajar, and suddenly he heard a rustling sound outside the door, and his heart skipped a beat. Then the door was gently pushed open, and a beautiful woman walked in, with a high bun, a white face, wearing a light green cloud dress, her golden lotus feet narrow, barely a handful, standing with affection, gazing at him, a scent of non-orchid and non-musk assailed his nose, it was Lady He. In surprise, Xu Jing stood up to greet her. Lady He did not wait for him to greet her, but walked to his desk and sat down in the chair, smiling and said to Xu Jing: "Tonight the old man is on a fast day again, sleeping alone outside, not going to my room. Sitting alone, I think of you, young master, traveling in a foreign land. I can't help but feel lonely and bored, who will pity you? So I don't avoid suspicion and come to talk to you, I wonder what you think in your heart?" Xu Jing listened, and quickly said: "Thank you for your kindness, but I am used to being alone, living alone, quiet and undisturbed, and I can concentrate on reading. Lady He did not wait for him to finish speaking, but snatched the words and said: "The ancients said it well, there is beauty in books, does the young master want to get beauty? But there is also beauty in front of you, why bother to seek it in books?" Hearing what Lady He said, Xu Jing felt even more that she was deliberately teasing him. Who knew that falling flowers were intentional, but flowing water was merciless. He was a dignified man, how could he do such a beastly act? It could be said that she had no eyes! So he said again: "I, Xu Jing, have lived for more than twenty springs and autumns, but I don't understand what beauty is like jade or iron, I only know how to contribute to the country with all my ability, hoping to achieve success and not live up to this life, why does Lady He have to say this?" Seeing that he was very serious, Lady He smiled and said: "I don't believe that there are men in the world who don't know love, you are such a young man, really cute, but you don't want to act like a moral gentleman in front of me, it will only make me laugh at you for being stupid! Do you know my heart?" You don't have to be afraid of that old man, he will never know. You and I are happy, don't let down my deep affection. " Saying that, she stood up and leaned her delicate body to Xu Jing's side, extending her soft and tender arms to shake hands with Xu Jing. Xu Jing's face turned pale. At this time, he could not care about offending or not offending her. He raised his right arm and blocked Lady He's hand to one side, stood up and said: "What is this like? I have said before that Xu Jing is a dignified and upright man, and he will never do such a beastly act. Please cherish yourself. Shame and loyalty, everyone has it, shameless and shameless, is a monster among people, please go back quickly, preserve your face, otherwise I will go to tell my uncle. "(58)</p>
