<p>社評</p>
<h3>北進南進與西進</h3>
<p>遠東蘇日變方大軍現方隔着邊界對峙，南太洋的民治陣綫亦復在極大的警覺中嚴陣以待，而連日消息傳來，日方未來的動向實着重在加緊進侵中國。一俟臨時議會通過緊急軍事預算之後，卽將分途在西北西南從事新的進攻。在已往的時期中，日方固然經當面臨着兩個以上的擴展歧途，但其中却總有某一確定路綫比較更佔優勢，有如在「七七」以前則側重攻蘇，中日戰爭爆發後則一意對華，最近年餘以來又亟謀南進；然而時至今日，於北進南進和西進之間，似乎難分軒輊，三者同時都有可能，也同樣各自具有相當困難，則其於此三者之如何取捨從違，正是一個極費考量的問題。</p>
<p>就這三種路錢的現實情况來看：則中日之間已經進行了四年又四個月的戰爭，至今仍在膠着之中，日方方欲求結束而不可得；關於北進，日軍經營最大，準備已屆完成，已往也曾一再作發動的嘗試，但因對方蘇聯亦復屯駐重兵，嚴加戒備，直到蘇聯西綫抗戰頗形不利的最近，依然無懈可聲，至於南進，雖然是年來日本大欲所寄，却着手最遲，準備最差，其所引起的反動與阻力也最大。就日方所揭橥的「大東亞共榮圈」而論，本來括有中國全部，貝加爾湖以東的西比利亞和南洋各屬的全部，然而要想囊括如此龐大地區顯非一蹴可及，是以年餘以來，日方一貫對外政策不外是要在這三面爲敵的形勢中求得一方面或兩方面的緩和，以便集中精力從事於另一方面的攻勢，諸如對中國的和平攻勢，蘇日中立協定的簽訂，美日談話的發動，都是這種政策的實際表現。而其結果或則毫無成就，或則僅有局部的成功，或則至今仍復相持未決，斷而復續；但是總而言之，直到最近，日當局始終都不能不把心力和兵力分散到幾個方面，無論是在中國，在東北或南洋，日本都沒有得到可以安然放心向着另一方向從事擴展的保障。固然，有如中國，爲了規復失土，自然時時醞釀着反攻，而蘇聯和各民主國之於日本，則只求保衛領土，不遭侵略，絕無進而威脅日本的意念，不過在亟謀擴展的日人心目中，則難免認爲此種現行形勢一天不變更，則一天不便從事於斷然冒險行動，尤其自從遠東ABCD陣綫形成以援，更　覺絕大不安，其實所謂打破ABCD包圍者，其眞實含義只是要消除擴展途徑上的阻力和障礙而已。</p>
<p>東條之繼任閣揆，固然表示着日方北進企圖更形迫切，但是西錢作戰的蘇軍，在極端不利的形勢中迄仍未失掉其勇氣和信心，對於東北邊境上的小規模挑釁，蘇當局也依舊以一貫的堅强態度來答覆，事實如此，似乎這還不是實行對中蘇兩面作戰計畫的適當時機。在美日之間，談判固毫無進展，日方輿論近又極見鴟張，反美宣傳，幾乎達到兩年餘以前反英運動同樣的程度，然而以最近英美遠東政策之同樣積極和堅決，日方未必就眞由虛聲恫嚇進入實際的挑戰，致使正感英雄無用武之地的英美主力艦隊得到一試身手的機會，更何况卽在喧囂異常的反美呼聲之中，對美獲致妥協的企圖也並未斷念。就這種情勢看來，以言南進或北進的斷然行動，在目前還嫌太早，換句話說，也就是時機和準備都還不够，而「解決中國事變」則恰又是準備程序中的重要一環。</p>
<p>最近日方在越邊屯集重兵，山西日軍也有渡河西窺西安之勢，這一大規模的鉗形攻勢的目的自然一部分是爲了解除將來北進或南進的牽制，但就中日戰爭本身而言，則將爲武漢會戰而後最重要的一役，這一鉗形兩翼的進攻目標也就正是前此坂垣所稱「停戰錢」的南北兩終點。三年以來、，歷任日當局對於中日戰局只有枝枝節節的應付與政治上外交上的試探，對於武力解決的途徑似已失却信心，但此次東條登台後首先揭藥「對華戰事求勝利的解決」，旋即決定召集議會要求通過對華追加戰費，在軍事上又復調動重兵窺伺陜滇，其究竟有無貫澈此一企圖的實力以及能吾重振久歸疲敝的軍心，姑置不論，此一未來大戰，無論對於中國作戰的前途以至遠東大局的安危，都正具有非常重大的意義，至於日本南進北進之是吾眞能遂行，也全要看此戰結局如何。</p>
<p>所謂南進北進與西進絕非截然三事，而只是日本擴展政策的幾種形態；尤其自從蘇德戰事爆發，美國日益逼近戰爭之後，遠東各部分的安危已經形成一個整個問題，而中日戰局實爲其間的主要關鍵。經過最近湘北豫北兩度戰事之後，已經更提高了華軍作戰必勝的信念，加以最近諸友邦不斷以戰具和人材相供給，相信必能在未來的衛土大戰中表現其嶄新的成就；只是日方如眞發動新的攻勢，當必處心積慮以求一逞，絕不容過分忽視，對於這一點，正不止中國自身須加以莫大警戒。</p>
<p>歐戰業談</p>
<h3>羅斯福邱吉爾　大西洋會見始末　（四）</h3>
<p>至於羅斯福總統和邱吉爾首相議定的八項原則，內容如下：</p>
<p>（一）英美兩國無意擴　領土及其他；</p>
<p>（二）兩國希望，任何領土，凡與有關係民族之自由願望不相符貧者，不得轉讓；</p>
<p>（三）兩國尊重各民埃之權利，以便選擇適應其生存之政府：並望獨立自主政府被武力刦持各國，得以恢復原狀；</p>
<p>（四）兩國在適當的尊重現行各項義務範圍內，努力使各國，無分大小，無分征服者與被征服者，得在平等條件下，共同獲得貿易及繁榮經濟必需的全世界原料；</p>
<p>（五）兩國亟望各國在經濟方面通力合作，以便共同達到勞動狀况改善，經濟進步及社會安全之目的；</p>
<p>（六）一俟國社黨暴政摧毀之後，兩國希望奠定一種和平，從而使各民族在其境內安居樂業，並保證各地方各民族自由生存，無虞恐怖與匱乏；</p>
<p>（七）此項和平計劃應使各民族能自由出入海洋，不受妨碍；</p>
<p>（八）兩國相信，全世界各民族，無論爲現實的或道義的理由，務須不再使用武力。惟鑒於各國倘繼續在陸海空方面整軍經武，以侵略他國，或意存此項威脅，未來和平即無從保持，故主張欲樹立廣大和持久的共同安全制度，必先使此等國家裁减軍備。兩國對於其他各種切實步驟，凡足爲愛好和平各民族减輕軍備上的重負者，亦當予以援助與鼓勵。</p>
<p>按此八原則，與一九一八年美國故總統威爾遜的十四原則，實屬互相呼應。但十四原則以政治問題爲主，八原則則以經濟問題爲主。</p>
<p>關於八原則中原料分配和勞工待遇兩項，英國勞工大臣貝文曾擬有具體的實施方案。據他向運輸及總工會會議中宜佈，內容可分爲六點：</p>
<p>（一）種原料及主要食糧，不得再由投機家專利操縱；</p>
<p>（二）各種日用品，如油，煤，橡膠，鑛砂，及主要食物之分配，應由國際統制；</p>
<p>（三）各種原料品之運輸及運費，亦當由國際共同經營，與原料品本身無異，以便保證適當分配，並促成全世界工人生活標準的平等；</p>
<p>（四）勞工待遇和工資的國際統制，當然與原料統制相聯繫；</p>
<p>（五）提高黑種工人之勞動狀况，亦爲重要目標，俾其日後能在國際勞動界，取得平等地位。</p>
<p>（六）蘇聯所由能發動偉大的抗戰，厥因蘇聯農民（雖有大多數參加集體農塲工作），都有耕者有其出的感覺。</p>
<p>最後貝文以爲歐洲不能冉佔據從前一般優勢的地位，反之，從事於初步生產的各國，則對於世界前途，須有較大的發言權。</p>
<p>最後，他說，「我相信，英國，中國，美國和蘇聯，或者應當在未來世界的組織中，擔任今日從未有人相　過的要角。」（完）</p>

<p>昨洋米突起跌風、實爲一般米奸料想不到、小絞跌小十四五允、其他各米均小十二三四元不等、市形仍疲、米市前途至此始有一綫曙光、按其下跌原因、（一）為金價猛落，（二）工部局管理目前日用品市塲之權力、已由領事團核准、此後對於米麪等日用品將令業中人呈報數量及存　地點並關於出售價格之規定、遂使囤戶恐慌、誠恐囤米有被徵發及定價出售之舉、故不敢再事囤積、（三）因傳說工部局已得平準會核准供給美滙二百二十萬元以事購米之說、（四）因工部局此舉深得各方之同情支持、不無相當之壓力、（五）因局米逐日有到、儲積日厚、不難應付全市之需、可以改善目前零零落落之現象、米蠢囤虎知所寒心、（六）爲市塲監視加嚴與公會之警吿、使皮球搶帽子之單大爲歛跡、（七）保險業曾議停保囤棧各貨、亦爲囤戶投機之致命傷、因此市價一再猛瀉矣、小絞英華司一跌即至一百九十四元、現米自一百七十元小至一百五十八元、次一百五十四五元、一號西貢自一百九十八元至一百八十八元、其他無一不下瀉、成交不到一萬包、</p>
<p>工部局米雖陸續到埠、但市上仍絕少見、以致一聞有局米到店、無不立集多人、昨晨由新閘路、浙江路、大新街、東新橋、經法租界沿廿一路公共汽車路綫直抵辣斐德路金神父路冉至亞爾培路亨利路勞爾東路巨籟達路西摩路至靜安寺路止、只見湖北路相近北海路一家在糶局米、待糴的人、自該店門首起南行西折至隆泰號門前止、編號爲三百三十二人、然在後未編號之人、仍接至海口路中段、首尾相距不遠、此外只於勞爾東路上見一家米店、掛有局米售完之市招、其他一無所見、至晚六時左右、始見愛文義路大通路東首有一家米店在開始糶局米、聚集待糴者已有百餘人、現下工部局米米店旣不出售、一般職工家庭不能與强橫之小販、及兇橫之江北媽媽、爭雜斗米之一席地、只有忍痛購買米店之高價米、米店竟有將店中存米出理一空、回說無米、亦有抬價出糶、有晨往購米一百八十二元、午後又索一百八十六元、但昨日大市反跌十一二元、可見米店漲則跟大市走、跌則竟不顧大市矣、</p>
<p>洋米大批接踵來滬、連日洋米到埠、為數甚鉅、各情迭誌本報、昨日太古公司廣東輪抵滬、由香港裝來洋米一萬三千零七十一包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、其中一萬零二百包、係工部局平價小絞米、聞尙有大批在來滬途中、（祖）</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米到貨雖仍不旺、但因洋米猛跌、本鄕店銷不暢、故結果售價亦見帶軟、若崑山新粳初開高價爲二百零五六元、特別二百零七八元、後二百零二三元、靑角窰種二百零二元半、二百零二元、菉種二百零五六元、南港早破二百零四元、次全二百元、新杜尖一百八十八元、計小三元左右、</p>
<p>糯米、香港貨因市貨將罄、依然俏色、開高自二百十八元决至二百十五元、糯茶二百元、國糯則以來源已通、且貨品較劣、人心頗懈、售二百零六元、</p>
<h3>洋粉究亦不支</h3>
<p>昨洋粉雖乏正市、然被黃金米價狂跌影響、暗盤交易稀而見跌、且人心虛軟、或須再小、倘保險停保棧粉、則後市或難支持高價也、昨金龍已自五十七元半小至五十六元、砲臺牌開五十九元半及五十九元後、均乏受主顧問、惟麩皮仍以缺貨扳到五十九元、客麩開五十七元、</p>
<h3>金價本該跌　無如搜羅殷</h3>
<p>自工部局將有管制上海各種日用品之實際權力、頓使一般如米麵紙烟油皂等行市發生動搖、紛紛下跌、糖雖在操縱之下、亦是跌停板、金價雖跌、但作祟之銀行逢低則進、遂使欲墮反回、如金價一日不小，物價將爲所支持、仍有小跌大漲之時、可知擾亂大衆之生活、其最大原因、實爲不顧大衆福利之收買黃金者、</p>
<p>現金烚赤暗市、仍於塲外及電話中做開、市價先在跌後稍回、一度慘瀉至二萬元大關內、蓋上日代南京幫傾售之某金號及銀號幫猛烈吐售也、照各方人心不定中稍形帶疲、晨初即做低一百元、爲二萬〇六百元、某銀號及滙票商稍有納胃、但現金號力售百數十兩，金號及另一銀號先後爭出、九點五十五分後展開跌風、竟步瀉一千三百元、破入二萬元後、更少買戶、十點卅五分退見一萬九千三百元低價、此價成交頗多、銀號忽來復進、證券號見低亦購、及見金號亦復進、遂起回風、步漲一千一百元、升至二萬〇四百元、午刻重見挫落、正午二萬〇二百元、下午初又退至二萬元左右、某行仍有吸胃、提升至二萬〇四五百元終、以人心不振、四點許叉降至二萬〇二百元、比上日再降五百元、查已連跌三天、共小二千四百元、當日有一千三百元高低、交易不稀、現金號之本牌金、門布售價二萬〇五百元、吸進减千元左右、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金、每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行於上午先掛小四决、共跌一百六十元、退至一千九百六十元、午刻回升二次、漲一百元、爲一千〇六十元、（收進减一百五十元）軋小六十元、紋銀仍無掛牌、暗市價已做小五元、爲甘七八元云、</p>
<h3>黑匯暗緊　港幣獨升餘皆跌</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、中央與滙豐兩掛牌未更、英美匯小櫃檯價如前、英美滙黑黑市暗緊甚厲、進口商搪洋行扒結仍殷、近日向外銀行轉賬過戶甚難、有案手續費美金一二五、故向華商投機家手中所結得水被凍結之資金二元六二五、實數結得僅二元半、英滙再見一辦士七一八七五空前貴價、但至正午扒風始平、勢亦稍回、英金二辦士、美滙三元、均有扒者、價與上日收市犬致相同、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨現金價續跌十五元、英金票亦回小三元、美金票曾退至三十九元、最後價爲三十九元三角、比上日軋跌九角、香港票、則續升三角、日金票略起回風、晚市退爲三元九角、朝鮮票供求尙勻、市價站平、晚市仍站三元七角原價、</p>
<h3>期紗做新交易　有力者仍在拉抬</h3>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、經前之結價後、昨日開始新交易、塲中買賣、其所拍各月期之時問、及最後收盤價、已有史動、計自每日上午丸時開盤後、十一月與十二月、其每盤所做時間均爲一刻鐘、而一月份前二盤均爲半小時、至第三盤亦做一刻鐘、其先所做均爲繼續買賣、待三盤完全拍好後、在所餘之一刻鐘內、再做一次競爭買賣、以其所做市價、作爲最後收盤行市之標準、午後以此類推、據云其最後之競爭板、因運來劇漲暴跌、變幻靡定、一般從事者、每以近期收盤後遠期開做、突起波動、而感未能買賣了結之苦、故於三盤後再做一次競爭板、以便了結云、昨市市價雖因買賣、本特證與佣金均有加而交易頗少、但市價極為挺硬、有力者仍不乏收購、上午開出十一月份爲二七三二元低盤、午收已抬全二八四〇元、十二月份爲二千九百元開出、乃高至二九五〇元，一月份三〇五〇兀開盤、午收略軟爲三〇三〇元、午後有力者仍有吸收、續呈上漲、十一月期以二八八〇元收市、較結價高上二百三十二元、十二月爲三〇七〇元收市、較結價漲上三百三十元、一月份以三二五〇元收盤、較結價好上叫百九十二元、據云以每决漲跌以二百元爲限云、茲列表於後、</p>
<p>紗市轉平趨勢帶弱、此因連朝上漲程度已高、市情一定、同時黃余回鬆一步、引起獲利者吐出、檯面一鬆、拋空又復活躍、市價下落、二十支雙馬廠單首盤價為三千零五十元、比上日收盤價跌一百三十五元、但盤子旣開低、補空者蠭擁而來搶進、一霎間抬至三千一百廿五元、旋後聞黃金回挫、浮戶又來蠢動賣空、加之龍頭布下降、絡續壓低至三千元進關、爲二千九百七十五元、然低盤一現、實力充足之戶、突來照市拖進、籌碼稍見緊張、同時龍頭布又回好八元、市盤即刻步跳至三千零九十元、收盤價爲三千零八十五元、成交漸漸增進、</p>
<p>現紗情况、開盤頗昂、大衆說謂原料天天上漲、就成本方面、不能看跌、然雙馬廠單已回下、加之黃金鬆懈、因之以後市價逐步下挫、但大戶之貨仍不放棄也、査半日間成交六百包、行情的跌七八十元之譜、</p>
<p>午後聞金雙馬期貨忽然趨升、遠期有至三千二百兀、同時龍頭布價續漲、黃金復昂、人心大振、有一部份掮客在市搜羅現紗、而苦不賣戶、自下之紗市誠可謂飄忽無定難以捉摸也、</p>
<h3>銀根甚緊　公債所漲乃微</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市繼續堅穩、檯面上公債消化力似已加健、惟丙種於一日內數度抬出六元外、終仍打破爲美中不足耳、供求方面、賣方大都爲金融界、買方大都爲補空做多者、因銀根甚緊、　數成交、轉向他家押借、而他家復冉向市塲賣出、如此頭寸可以寬裕、并可得雙重優厚之利息、目下向外壓款祇少數可以通融、但利息至少月息一分半、故形勢仍未必有大好面、昨上午同康·易中·大中·同順買進、潤德·怡泰·中孚·新華等賣出、兩三决抬出六元關、終以現貨壓迫而再進關、午後悄形大致相同、益昌順泰鴻大買進、協興元。怡泰賣出、走勢與上午如出一轍、丙種兩度穿出六元、終仍被壓低、環境情形如此、戰事情形如彼、金融情形又如此加緊、故前途無多大樂觀也、市價結果一律續漲九分至四角不等、成交數共計的一百七八十萬兀、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大中華火柴公司股一百股、偕爲每股九十七元半、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市開盤、賣氣較旺、價格逐形下降、嗣忽止跌回堅、各股大都漲至原盤、若會德　鋼業等、收盤時幾鮮賣戶、橡皮股趨勢極穩、惟據另一消息、則上海方面拖駁、有逐漸移往他處之趨勢、</p>
<h3>期糖一瀉直下　昨跌停板</h3>
<p>昨糖市因連日在泓之後、已到相當高峯適値金價轉跌、價乃隨落、公司期貨二四粗白十日　三百五十三元、二十日期三百六十五元、均吿跌停板、俱小二十元、現貨一四粗白十月份到貨上午三百五十元、至三十五元、下午四十元至三十八元、降上八元、九月份三百四十六元、三十元、下午四十一元、三十七元、降度同、八月份三百四十元、二十五元、下午三十五元、三十二元、降二十四元、香港貨三百元、二百八十五元、下午二百九十七元半、寬降五十元半、</p>

<h3>工部局管理物價　正在迅速進行中　統制價格已有具體辦法　促請行號入進口商協會</h3>
<p>工部局發言人昨（五日）晨聲稱、該局遂日集會、討討論物價管理事宜者、已兩週於茲、今且經領事團核准新附則、不營得一巨棒爲武器、物價之管理、自將加倍迅速進行、規定物價之詳細辦法、仍在討論中、不日即有決定辦法云、同時、本市進口商對於工部局得權可懲罰漁利之零售商事、均表歡迎、某美商稱、工部局現定已獲得共所求之全部權力、祗待該局善爲利用云、其他進口商對於工部局行動將如何奏效一節、均保留其意見、但皆以爲新附則已予工部局以其需耍已久之權力、各進口商且謂彼等必與工部局全力合作、以退制零售商之暴利行爲、</p>
<p>即將實行　公定價格</p>
<p>自領事團批准洋涇浜地皮章程新附則後、工部局對於今後各種貨物可以公定價格、隨時布告實行、並取締投機漁利、至於具體辦法、據開大致如下、即不論個人及合夥營業、如販賣工部局所指定之必需品及零賣物時、必須將（一）最高存量及儲存塲所、（二）購入價格及日期、（三）販賣價格及數量販賣狀况等、作成極詳細之紀錄、以便工部局派員調査、俾便從事於統制價格、至於各零賣物資之最高限價、則由工部局與進口商協會決定、一俟此項最高價格發表後、即不得任意變更、各零賣商人對於顧客購入必需品之種類。數量及價格、亦須詳細開具發票、以資査考、</p>
<p>促進口商　加入協會</p>
<p>據工部局情報處公吿、關於本局提議設置一進口商與製造家協會一事、前經公布在案，本局茲請各行號、凡在原則上贊同此一協會之組織者、儘速投函外灘十七號倍克洋行、示以各該行號所經營而能依照十月三十一日本局公布之辦法、予以管理之出品各稱、至於零售商人願意與此一有利公衆之物價管理計劃合作者、亦請從速函吿該洋行、共策進行、</p>
<p>大宗商品　即可到滬</p>
<p>據若干商人向記者稱，本市全部外商、對於領團之批准新附則、表示謝意、以新附則授於工部局、以實際權力、甚望工部局善於應用、以杜絕囤積漁利、彼等對平準會政策、頗多希望、甚望進口商人協會能對上海各商行所需外匯之分配、予以改善、據稱、現有大量商品運來中國、可供一年之需要、同時彼等亦運布匹至自由中國、以自由中國各醫院及慈善團體、頗感需要、</p>
<p>進口商人　竭力合作</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、主要進口外商現正注視工部局抑低物價之努力、一面自行展開對零售奸商而施之運動、其進行方法、如果普遍施用、定可根除一切必需品之囤積與暴利等弊、綜括言之、此方法爲利用公衆之襄助、監視各零售店舖、務使其必照進口商規定之價出售物品、如不照規定價格而置警吿於不頹者、即停止以貨供給、最後進口商亦能以物品直接零售予公衆、以免居間者之漁利、</p>
<p>吉時洋行　採取步驟</p>
<p>進口行多家、業已決定自行辦理一切、而與工部局及法公董局合作進行、其中一家係美商吉時洋行其所承銷克林牌牛乳、亦係必需品、可照官定匯率、獲得外滙、該洋行經理柏倫資頃向記者談稱、該洋行分銷克林牛乳之万法、其他必需品之進口商、已有仿行者、改善本市物價狀况之兩項先決條件、爲照官定匯率給予外滙、及調整航運情况、上月間航運情况惡化、故該洋行有克林牛乳一批、本應上月抵滬者、今料將於本月杪、方能運到、克林牛乳現有足敷本市三個月應用之存底、</p>
<p>制裁漁利　有效辦法</p>
<p>吉時洋行抑制零售商暴利之方法、為籍無綫電向公衆說明其售價規定爲一磅罐十六元、二磅半罐三十一元五角、五磅罐七十元、該行旣獲有平準會撥給之外匯、故照法幣批貨予零售商、其價三閱月來並無變動、若奸商抬高售價、顧客中必有聆得無錢電報吿者、修函吿知吉時洋行、行方爲答謝計、即以牛乳直接售予該顧客、然後致函該被告發之零售店、加以警告、</p>
<p>發現囤積　停止給貨</p>
<p>如數日後見其還此警告於不理、立即停止給貨、另一項問題、厥爲零售店之揚言貨已售完、吉時洋行得悉其事、必派代表前往調査其帳目與存貨、如發現有囤積情事、即加警吿、苟不生效、亦停止給貨、數家大店舖已因此而遭吉時洋行拒絕給貨、且該行將在靜安寺路自設門市部、直接發售、迄今為止、以此法抑低克林牛乳之價、頗見功效云、</p>
<p>警務當局　處罰從苛</p>
<p>柏氏又稱道法租界警務處之工作、謂法警務處自行調査零售店、並根據吉時洋行供給之情報、而對奸商罰鍰五百元之多、今公共租界工部局亦經訂定新附則而獲同樣之權力、希望公共租界警務處亦將採取强硬立塲、法租界內克林牛乳零售商之漁利情事、遠較公共租界爲少、允有一項問題、爲市民因價格激漲而囤積以備自用、此舉直接刺激價格之飛漲、故吉時洋行近規定零售店出售克林牛乳時、均啓其罐、故至多祇能保藏兩月、</p>
<h3>工部局積極調劑粉市　籌設麥粉平賣會</h3>
<p>工部局爲謀調劑粉市起見、業向平準基金委員會申請法定外滙、以便直接訂購洋粉運滬發售、該局定於本月十日（星期一）下午二時、在江西路二〇九號該局會議室召開兩租界麵粉批發商人會議、討論組織「上海麥粉平賣委員會」、籌商墊款訂購洋粉事宜、所有訂購之洋粉、一俟運滬、即在該局嚴密管理之下平價發售、其售價亦由該局規定之、兩租界麵粉批發商人願意出席上項會議者、應於本月七日下午四時以前函知江西路二〇九號工部局總辦處、以便核奪辦理、詳情另見該局本日佈吿、</p>
<h3>米糧買賣僅限實銷　昨日米價暴跌　發售平米昨已擴大範圍　當局嚴禁米糧運離租界</h3>
<p>平民爭購洋米　（焦超攝）</p>
<p>米行茶會市塲管理委員會爲取締市塲非法交易、促使同業買賣趨於正軌起見、特召開第九十二次委員會議、籌商善策、經議決結果、從嚴取締市塲暗盤交易、凡在市塲買賣、一律以實銷爲限等紀錄在卷、昨特佈吿市塲云、「査通來米價在漲不已、再不制止、影響民食殊深、爰經本委員會第九十二次會議議決、自即日起、本市塲買賣應遵守塲章、切實依順序交易、以實銷爲本、並勸導客家凡有存貨、亟宜出售、掮客經手亦須注意、以實銷爲宗旨、庶衡平市價、可基於斯、倘有不依定章、擅自取巧經營者、一經察出、當即訴之當局、俾憑制裁嚴懲、望一體遵照、切勿自誤誤人、此佈、」</p>
<p>發售平米　擴大範圍</p>
<p>公共租界工部局為積極設法抑平米價起見、爰即轉向香港政府往返電洽、繼續裝運大宗仰光特別小絞米、俾在本市普遍平售、據悉自上週以來、絡續運抵平米的達七萬包以上、現已由各承辦洋行分別發給各米號在門市照章平售，茲悉昨日下午三時起、大部份米號均已將承領之平米出棧、在門市發售、但升斗小民、均携破舊容器在各該米號爭贓港米、卒因人數過衆、米號職員頗不及應付、</p>
<p>禁運米糧　嚴格執行</p>
<p>工部局作再繕發佈吿略稱二任何品質、或任何數量之米糧、凡非先向本局警務處領得特別許可證者、一概不准運離公共租界、（運往法租界除外）、其有自公共租界携帶或運出之米糧、而未經領得本局之許可證者、一經査獲、即由巡捕當塲沒收」云云、査工部局對於該項禁運辦法、曾一再知照全市商民人等、但仍有一般奸商暗中偷運、影響民食存底匪淺、顧茲事體大、工部局深盼全市居民共同協助、以戢此種偷運惡風、</p>
<p>昨日米價　直綫下瀉</p>
<p>自經兩租界當局採取緊急措置、積極設法抑平米價以還、一般投機米好、不無當頭一棒、活躍乏力、同時各米號均已恢復發售平價港米、無意在塲添辦高價現貨、以致市塲實銷一落千丈、但各大戶均圖於斯高價時、將囤貨吐脫變現、現貨益增、而去路反滯呆不暢、乃人心浮動、注意難定、昨日米市已開始猛跌、小絞米較諸前市暴落十四五元，今日市况將益軟化、據悉一般業外投機奸商、顯已遭受嚴重打擊、</p>
<h3>大量米棉　昨今到滬</h3>
<p>工部局平價洋米、昨日又有一萬零二百包到滬、由太古公司廣東輪從香港運來、另有客貨洋米二千八百七十一包、共計一萬三千零七十一包、該輪停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>英商夏勞臣洋行、經理之巴拿馬商輪琴及尼亞（SS　Virginia）號、由南美賽部埠、運來棉花五千五百餘作、開今日上午可到滬、停靠虹口公和祥碼頭起卸、另有華華（SS　Wawa）、亦由賽都埠運來棉花七千餘件、略須延緩到埠、約下週一可來滬、該項棉花聞係本市北京路一百九十號某猶太商採購</p>
<h3>英僑婦孺　撤退登記</h3>
<p>僑滬英籍婦孺紛紛　應英當局數日前所發之撤退勸吿、而於前日（四日）開始赴英領署撤退科登記、此項登記手續、將至十一月十五日終止、記者頃以此事叩諸負責進行撤退計劃之英方官員、彼等俱守絨默、但一般人相信太平洋爲起緊念局勢、英方必能獲得船隻、以載登記之英僑離滬、</p>
<h3>美感恩節　滬美僑將慶祝</h3>
<p>本月二十一日爲美國具有攸久歷史之感恩節、旅滬美僑與英國僑民、均於是日舉行熱烈慶祝、英美牧師、亦擬在敎堂行祈禱禮、羅斯福總統、屆時復有感恩詞寄滬、由美在華推事朗誦、美國學校均分別放假紀念、美國總會與扶輪會、亦舉行餐叙、在滬美僑於紀念感恩節之餘、以羅斯福總統於去年一月五日聯蟬總統、將作更盛大紀念、</p>

<h3>烟兌業公會昨籌商　整頓買賣業規　今日起恢復同業交易　通告嚴禁非會員入場</h3>
<p>上海市烟兌業同業公會、前爲取締市塲非法交易、穩定整個市況起見、曾規定同業在塲買賣辦法、通告全體同業知照在案、茲因受業外投機奸商參與交易、及業中人肆虐市塲影響、以致各項日用物品、及捲烟等售價、竟至一日數變、貽害民生匪淺、該會鑒於職責所在、不忍坐視、除通告暫停三天市塲交易外、復於昨日下午三時半、在寗波路會所召開同業代表大會、沈延挺主席報告開會宗旨、並剴切勸告全體同業、勿囤貨、勿居奇、務以民生爲重、共謀穩定市況、後即議商同業在塲買賣業規、直至四時一刻散會、對於所議辦法需時整理、今日或可公佈實施、</p>
<p>嚴禁非會員入市塲　烟兌市塲於三日起停業後、迄今已告期滿、恢復買賣、該會昨特佈告市塲云、「爲通告事、查本市塲人數突多、擁擠已極、妨礙市塲非鮮、其中不無有非會員混入其中、以致秩序混亂、本會為維持市塲起見、自每日上午八時至十一時半、下午一時至三時半、各會員入塲營業、必須遵照　規、各自隨帶出入證照片、經門差檢查確係本人方可入內、如無本會出入證者、及不論何人、於規定時間內一槪不准入內、並禁止帶同非會員入內、以肅塲規、而維秩序、仰希各會員一體週知、此佈」、</p>
<p>售價上騰操縱所致</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向熟諳烟兌市況者探悉、各種日用物品存底、目前並未稀尠、但此種現象（製成品）大都被黑心奸商所操縱、以致市塲現貨籌碼減退、買者不易購辦、人心不無恐慌、售價卒被頻頻抬高、誠爲有史以來所未見、先將本月三日之肥皂火柴行市抄錄如下、（一）火柴、美麗牌每箱二千零八十元、鳳凰牌每箱二千零三十元、（二）肥皂、固本每箱一百十元、白祥茂每箱一百零二元、黃祥茂每箱九十六元、據悉、此次因售價急進猛升、各烟兌店均獲有極豐厚利潤、</p>
<p>派貨批發亟宜改良　查滬上之烟紙店、鏻次櫛比、大小實難確計、其中逾半數能享受廠方之派貨權利、其餘因資本或其他關係、而難享上述權利、故不得不向批發商去批、可是派貨與批貨相較、價格相差懸殊、因之、所謂大發暴利者、決非小烟兌店所能享受、而急切須注意者、即如廠方派貨、須視銷貨多寡而公允照派、批發價目亦宜改正一律、（市上竟有每五百支或二百五十支、此批發商、同一貨品價目、相差五分至七八角等）、零售價目亦應規定一律（酒吧間遊藝塲例外）、今試舉再普通的一二爲例比、「老刀」、派貨價五萬支爲三一八零元、「五華」、派貨每五萬支一零　零元、批發每五萬支爲二零八零元、零售老刀每小包五角五分至七角、五華每小包三角八分至四角五分、再後、希望當局如決議抑制物價者、必須判明治本辦法、一意制止零售、亦非良計、</p>
<h3>德貨船易名　航界詫異　已載貨駛返日本</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、德貨船基多號、現受日海軍租用、而改名爲天日丸、於十月二十八日夜間悄然駛入浦江、載滿柴油後、已於上週杪離滬出口、聞係駛返日本、查該船懸日旗、駛抵本埠時、曾使航運界大感詫異、皆疑其為太平洋中德方剽襲艦之供應船、因該船船名已塗沒、且髹青灰僞裝色也、日海軍發言人雖稱此說爲「完全無稽」但對該船來滬之眞正目的、未作滿意之答覆、日方另一官員承認天日丸之船員日人德人俱有、但稱水手以日人佔多數、</p>
<h3>滬羅馬尼亞僑民　赴菲被拒登岸　萊盧濱有親軸心嫌疑</h3>

<h3>夫婦知識</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾　合著　（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓　（時間）上午十時至下午六時　星期日休息</p>
<p>丈夫腎虧體衰妻子恨海難填</p>
<p>但願嫁得賣油郎·夫婦恩愛情深</p>
<p>不願虛作富家婦·青春蹉跎虛負</p>
<p>金玉其外，敗絮其中，這就是古人譏喻人之外強中乾者。男子如果徒有雄偉之外貌，而無健全之體能，這又同繡花枕頭，有什麽區別呢？假如一個精強力壯的男子，和一個嬌豔美麗的女子結婚以後，必定兩情繾綣，情意密密。猶如戲水鴛鴦，怎不叫人羨煞。本來性的健全，纔爲男女愛情的結合體。性能康健的夫妻，猶如比翼雙鳥，雙宿雙飛，形影不離。生男育女，幸福無比。但是一個女子，一旦嫁着一個腎虧體衰的丈夫，致性生活不能圓滿。這怎麼不叫她芳心欲醉，憤恨交併呢？妻子青春蹉跎，丈夫於心亦不忍，或竟妻子提出離婚者，家庭幸福亦隨之毀滅，豈不懼哉。</p>
<p>然而男子又怎麼會腎虧的呢？這大都由於男子早年犯有手淫，自瀆，致患有遺精。因經受有損傷。輸精管因之寬馳，而不能控制精液，久而久之，遂成早洩之症。此時，若在猶遲不治，則海綿體損壞而轉爲陽痿。至此性機能，摧殘殆盡，性器短小，頭昏腦脹，神經衰弱，耳鳴目眩，失眠遺精，腰酸背痛，記憶退步，思想呆鈍，意志恍惚，倦怠疲勞，心跳不安，就學無進，就業無成。尤可悲者，即爲星期之短小，或陽萎，早洩，以致子嗣不育，夫婦失歡，婚後幸福毫無。</p>
<p>然而吾國因習慣之故，人們患有性病之暗疾者，皆羞於見醫。因之遷延不治，終至夭亡。然今有科學倡明的時代，醫藥之進步，更屬驚人。即素以腎虧爲不治之症者，今亦可以藥物來治療。即凡患有上述各症者，祗須服以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素，」即能掃除凈盡。因此劑係由雄壯動物如猩猩海狗等體中，提取生殖腺素，再用科學方法煉製而成，所以品質純粹而高貴，藥性又和平而王道，服後，即能生精補腎，健腦活血，重振機能，增強發育，滋養神經，掃除衰弱，發揮偉大的效力，若能繼續服用，必可於短期內，將上訴各症悉數治愈。</p>
<h3>遺精不治幸福受阻</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>吾人畢生之幸福，建築在吾人身體之強健。而經血又爲強健體格之要素。所以我們要希望幸福，則不得不保養我們的精血。但是現代一般男子往往忽略了這一點，以爲清楚一去不復返，今日有酒今日醉。因之在年輕時，拈花惹草，恣意縱慾。結果致摧殘性機能之康健，而引起遺精，滑精，漏精，陽萎早洩，頭昏腦脹，腰酸背痛，心神恍惚，精神不振，腦力退步，直接應響學業及事業之成就。且因精血之枯竭，發育機能亦受其阻礙。遂呈身矮體輕，性器短小，而不能生育。此種青年不特學業與事業一無成就，且因陽萎早洩，而致不能使性生活有所圓滿。妻子憤恨，子嗣無出。一旦年老，不免有老大徒悲傷之感。眞的，此種生不能享閨房之樂，家庭之福音，雖生猶死，豈不悲者！</p>
<p>遺精旣足以毀滅人生之幸福，故應亟早就治。據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服「希米脫氏固精片」，最爲對症特效。蓋固此劑不特能鞏固精關，抑且能鎮靜神經。遺精自可痊愈。若因遺精已引起身體之衰弱者，尤須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經。短期內必可完全治愈。若患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等對症療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3>健美　女子乳峯高聳足以添嬌助妍麗</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　姚崇培</p>
<p>牡丹全憑綠葉助　女子尤須雙乳健</p>
<p>詩經云窈窕淑女，君子好逑。這就是說，女子欲爲男性所悅愛，不但須由嬌麗的臉龐，尤其要有窈窕的身段。但是配成窈窕身段之要素，不外乎豐腴的臀部，嫋娜的腰身。以及一對高聳在前胸的乳峯。我們可不許小覷了女子胸前的一對乳峯，要知道引誘異性，傾倒男子全憑這一對富有彈性的雙乳哩！且凡女子有高聳的乳峯者，必有健美的體格。由於卵巢機能之健全，新陳代謝作用亦必旺盛。是故肌膚潔滑晶瑩，臉色紅潤嬌豔。這種女子怎麼不叫男子不爲之傾倒銷魂。反之女子之乳峯因受自瀆束胸，白帶纏綿，月經不調，以致萎癟平坦，雖則穠妝艷抹，亦難博男子的青睞，同爲女子，爲何幸或不幸，竟有如此之甚者。</p>
<p>然而女子乳峯萎癟者，祗須服用卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，即可爲之挽救。此劑配藥精良，成份高貴，歷經世界各國名醫實騐，均證明藥性和平，功效偉大。如能繼續服用，不特可使萎癟之乳峯，在短期內日形高聳，同時且能調整月經，消滅白帶以及一切子宮疾患。促進姙娠機能，增進家庭幸福，旺盛新陳代謝，恢復紅潤臉色柔滑肌膚，長駐青春，鞏固夫婦愛情，實爲近代婦女界之唯一聖藥也。</p>

<p>當一個女子由中學，大學踱出來，再專心一意地草創她自己事業的　礎，不知那可貴的靑春，已偷偷擦身溜過去了，在歌頌「二八芳姿」「雙十年華」的中國社會中，往往被冠以「過時貨」的皇冕，更何况一部分人，嗜愛柔和如「小綿羊」，依人如「小雀兒·的女子，而對這些「談笑生風」「老氣橫秋」的「女學者」却多是敬而遠之的呢。</p>
<p>在每一靑年女子的面前橫着二條路－結婚，事業。固然有好多人說：「結婚，事業兩者是不相衝突的」；然而「因爲結婚而疏忽了業務」「一個女子因致力於事業，而釀成了家庭不幸」，乃是常見的事實。在兩者不能兼顧的情形之下，有一部分女子毅然跨上了那蕭案而漫長的「事業」之路。因爲她們旣不願麻木了那敏感多智的腦，閉上了申述正義的嘴，扮演成一隻受人憐憫的「小雀兒」；又不願坐視「丈夫在生活綫上掙扎」，自己默默地隨着「在水準下生活」。她們頤意自己在生活綫上掙扎；，寗願冒盡風霜的奔走，流盡血淚的苦幹，使在她自己的生命程中爆出喜悲成敗的火花。對整個人類有所貢獻。</p>
<p>因了上面兩層「外纅二內在」的原因，好多女子和「結婚」絕緣了，成爲「老處女」。</p>
<p>所以「老處女」並不能「任意的玩」，「安逸的睡」；相反的，她們所遭受的困難，比結婚的女子更繫複。因爲社會制度的不合理，女子職業是稀少而卑劣的，待遇是苛刻的。「老處女」要圖生存，必須要有莫大的勇氣和耐苦的精神。</p>
<p>每當「春秋佳日」「花晨月夕」，人們常對「老處女」投以憐憫和同情，然而她們郤無動於中，因爲她們也有丈夫和孩子的慰籍－便是事業上的同志和成就。</p>
<p>假如你是一個不願結婚或不能結婚的女子，快擦去你的脂粉，脫掉你的高跟鞋，認清了社會，國家，世界，認眞勤奮做「事」吧。這樣，十年以後，「流淚賦悲歌」的將不是一班「老處女」了。</p>
<p>小心些，這「事業之路」多崎嶇！別害怕，天上有明月朗星照着呢！</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我這篇文章，並不是提倡獨身主義，這是違反自然，社會原則的。然而有「老處女」沉澱下來，乃是不可吾認的事寶。查她們本身，往往是無瑕可擊，而由惡劣的社會習惯觀念，逼成她們的，如年事已長，容貌欠佳，妝態不豐均爲原因之一部分，還有一個大原因，便是：個性倔强，不甘附席爲「小雀兒」或「老母猪」。假如她想安逸，享樂，她應該聰明的趨向「結婚之途」那路較「事業之路」平坦，溫暖。我們應對「老處女」寄以深切同情，並暗示她們一出路。</p>
<p>然而更積極的，應該指正社會七對女子評價的不正確，並設法爲結婚女子造成一新地位，旣不做「小雀兒」又不爲「老母猪」做「？」：可以讓這班「老處女」嫁出去。先生揭　一下如何？此請撰安　柳賢敬上</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>法國淪陷區裏的人民</h3>
<p>— 君宜</p>
<p>安南，朝鮮，印度的百姓，都嘗够了他們做亡國奴的滋味，然而現在的法國淪陷區人民，名義上好像還是完整的國家底國民，其實實際上已和那些亡國之民不相伯仲了。不但精神上受到相當的痛苦，同時物質上也得到了很慘酷的虐待，在整個的淪陷區裏面，找不到一個營養充足精神愉快的身子，他們的臉上充滿了恐懼，胆怯，和柔弱無神的色彩，眞的他們的生活已漸漸地走近了地獄，不信的話，聽我道來；</p>
<p>第一樁便是日常必需的食料的缺乏，牛油肉類脂肪，和一類的東西，每隔一星期每人祗能得一磅左右，所有的僅是些失去了新鮮的蔬菜，風乾刮硬的黃麵包和白山薯，不要講別的，連醬油都給了他們一個限制，而且滋味等於鹽湯，因爲其中十分之三是滲入了顏色。</p>
<p>至於衣服，他們經過這决戰爭之後，幾乎有很多人家已十九燬於砲火，現在要想添一兩件衣服的話，眞是難上叉難，非在一個月之前向納粹在每一個城裏設置的管制局（這管制局專司法國人民的衣物及日常用品的統制和分配事宜。）去登記，經他們批准而付你購買許可證的時候，也許天氣已換了一個季候了，也衣服舖裏沒有這種許可證是不能賣束西給你的。）</p>
<p>他們在報紙上得不到一個準確可靠的新聞，那些報紙上不是說德軍佔領了那裏，便是些什麼德國運載十幾節的糧食車來接濟法國民衆的騙人消息；有少數偷置着收音機的一不小心被秘密警察聽了去，就不免在二十四小時內送你們一家上斷頭台，然而儘管刑罪定得這樣的嚴厲，到底還有不少人在冒這個大險。</p>
<p>最苦惱的便是那些可惡的德國流動隊員，在深更牛夜的時候，他們打開了大門而到你房裏，各處搜索，結果弄得一蹋糊塗之後，就踉踉蹌的跑了，有時看見美麗的姑娘，還要逼着和他接吻，這種事情每星期至少總會遇到一兩决，可是誰也不敢反抗過，有一次一個女靑年因爲說了一句不中聽的話，就被他們一刀戳穿了喉管。</p>
<p>在淪陷區裏的居家，非有政府發給的遷移證是不能隨便亂跑的，火車站的四周佈滿了檢査旅客的偵探，因此他們就差不多像判了一個終身監禁的罪名，像道種慘酷的生活過下去，試問那些一向過慣享樂的法國人民，那裹還放得出精神來。</p>

<h3>犯人的好癖</h3>
<p>— 沈雄</p>
<p>黃昏落到太平洋沿岸的一座監獄裏；於是夜了，萬籟俱寂，驀地起了一陣悠揚的喇叭聲，一遍又一遍。漸漸地四面八方有人　　了，最後竟成了百人的大台奏，他們奏着古老的熟悉的歌曲；藉了這動人的奏樂，全獄一千人得到了愉快的休息。他們白日在監獄的工　和作房裏操勞了一天。第一個把吹喇叭做爲好癖的是一個名叫沙昆定的犯人。</p>
<p>密歇根州監獄裏有個犯人利用每晚空閒的時間做小提琴，他唯一的工具是把小刀和一副削具，八僩月之後他竟大功告成。製成的小提琴精美無比，不懂手工好，音調亦佳。</p>
<p>在威斯康辛州監獄中，每星期日有一羣工人聚在農塲上，把美麗的有顏色的木片割成金鋼鑽形，星形，半月形，及其他各種形狀。他們用這些小片合成各種箱子，一隻箱子要一萬三千片小木片呢。這手藝眞是絕佳。而他們僅有的工具是小刀和沙紙。</p>
<p>幾樣簡單的工具加上耐性可以做好多的東西呢。他們還刻了許多動物和人像，每件玩藝都是犯人解除寂寞，利用時間的法子。</p>
<p>還有一個判了七年罪的犯人，把他過去的事蹟寫成小說——三部長篇小說和許多短篇小說。</p>
<p>這些事實在很値得我們思索的，因爲我們似乎很少注意到怎樣去培植一種好癖。被生活逼着的人，一天工作到晚，有錢的人，時間都消耗在聲色犬馬中；而眞眞有益於身心的好癖却無人顧到。但從現在起大家都盡可能的堵養一種好癖呢。</p>

<p>秋海棠站在一盞街燈下面，望着馬路上稀稀落落的幾條人影出神了好半響。</p>
<p>「這個，錢先生，我倒不想！」他聽錢若默的話說完了，才用很平靜的聲音回答。「要我去伺候那些有錢的大爺們，根本就不行，倒不如混在戲院子裹的好。」</p>
<p>「旣然你願意受一些委屈，那末祗能混幾時再說吧！」</p>
<p>錢若默便首先移動腳步，走過對街去吧；秋海棠便默默地隨在他身後。</p>
<p>「不過，我總怕你的身子會受不住。」</p>
<p>「才上去的幾天也許要特別辛苦一些，慢慢兒就會慣了！」對於秋海棠，今天的事，眞像山窮水盡疑無路柳暗花明又一邨的情景了，所以他自己的心裏頭，倒己覺得很滿足，絕對沒有再想挑剔的意思。</p>
<p>聽他這麼一說，錢若默也祗能微笑不語了。（二五五）</p>

<h3>泰羅鮑華的婚變</h3>
<p>— 沛霖</p>
<p>泰羅鮑華這名字，在一般影迷的心中似乎已刻下了一個深深的印象。這一位風流小生，自從拍成了「蘇彝士」一片後，即以閃電戰式的姿態與該片配角，法籍女星安娜蓓拉結了婚，當時一般人士都爲他的前途擔憂。但事實勝於雄辯，非但沒有影響到他的前途，而且在婚後很得意的對朋友們叙述他與安娜蓓拉美滿的結合，最近聽說有抱兒子的希望，這確是値得替他慶幸的事！</p>
<p>可是，俗語云：「月盈則缺」，據最近好萊塢傳來消息，說泰羅鮑華與安娜蓓拉因爲意見不合而發生了裂痕，紛紛傳說他們將要辦理離婚手續了。在好萊塢城裹，男女把婚姻二字確是視若兒戲，大有「今日結婚，明日離婚」之概。安娜蓓拉本來已結過一次婚，育有一個女孩，她與泰羅的結合已是重婚了，假使果眞的離婚，那麼好萊塢父將增加了一件離婚的案件。我們希望這是「謠傳」，並且點祝他們能書歸於好，免得變方受着意外的苦痛。</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Directs Frontline Commanders on Strategies to Thwart Japanese Advance; Japan Plans Major Offensive on Yunnan-Burma and China-Soviet Highways; Chinese Troops Mass in Shaanxi, Henan, and Yunnan Border for Strict Defense</h3>
<p>Guilin - According to reliable intelligence received by local military authorities, the Japanese army is planning new offensives towards Kunming, Changsha, and Chongqing. It is said that the Japanese army in Vietnam hopes to invade Kunming to cut off the Burma Road, while simultaneously launching another major offensive in Changsha to avenge their previous defeat. It is also rumored that the Japanese army in Yichang intends to advance westward to threaten Chongqing. It is reported that the highest Chinese military authorities recently convened an important military conference, where Generalissimo Chiang personally instructed the frontline commanders on strategies to deal with the advancing Japanese army. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Well-informed Chinese and foreign sources here predict that Japan will begin attacking China's two lifelines, namely the Burma Road and the route connecting to the Soviet Union, at the end of November or the beginning of December. The Japanese army has already begun preliminary operations to prepare for crossing the Yellow River, currently planning to eliminate the Chinese troops fighting in the Longmen Mountains and other areas east of the Yellow River. After seizing important crossing points on the eastern bank, the Japanese army will cross the river into Shaanxi Province and advance towards Xi'an, aiming to cut off China's supply line from the Northwest to the Soviet Union. However, since the Japanese army occupied Shanxi Province, the highest Chinese military authorities have long anticipated Japanese attempts to seize Xi'an, and have therefore amassed heavy troops on both the southwest banks of the Yellow River in Shaanxi and Henan provinces. These are mostly elite units of the Chinese army, equipped and trained with great precision. Xi'an's terrain is flat, making it difficult to defend, but there are high mountains on its southwest sides, where Chinese troops can hold strategic points to prevent the Japanese army from penetrating deeper into the Northwest. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Nichinichi Shimbun prominently published a special Shanghai dispatch today, stating that Chongqing, based on American plans, has concentrated 700,000 troops on the Yunnan-Vietnam border and the Yunnan-Burma Road. (United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>London - People here believe that if Japan makes a move, it will inevitably be to attack the Yunnan-Vietnam Highway. The Japanese army is currently gathered at the northern border of Vietnam, less than 200 miles from the Yunnan-Burma Road that turns south into Kunming. The Japanese army has a railway behind them, passing through Hanoi to the border, directly to Kunming. If Kunming falls, Chongqing's supplies would be almost completely cut off, and the difficulty of exiting the country can be imagined. Although the rainy season and period have now passed, the high mountains and dense forests are extremely difficult to traverse by air. Since the Japanese army entered Vietnam, defense of the Yunnan border has been strengthened. Diplomatic reporters here mostly have no definitive judgment on the possible reaction of the United States. However, the Yorkshire Post stated that Japan's invasion of Yunnan can be regarded as not hostile to Burma or Thailand, so the Japanese government can hope to avoid conflict with Britain and the United States.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in New York Remit Funds to Comfort Troops</h3>
<p>Chongqing - News yesterday stated that overseas Chinese in New York have remitted 350,000 yuan in national currency to Chongqing. 150,000 yuan is intended for the soldiers defending Changsha, while the remaining 200,000 yuan includes 100,000 yuan as a gift to the Guangdong provincial troops and 100,000 yuan to purchase medicine for wounded soldiers. (United Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Social Affairs Commends Compatriots in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chongqing - In the wake of the great victory in Northern Hunan, the Ministry of Social Affairs initiated a campaign to encourage compatriots across the country to donate funds for慰問 [comforting] the troops. According to a telegram from the Shanghai All-Circles Committee for Fundraising to Comfort the Troops, compatriots in Shanghai, upon hearing of another victory in Northern Hunan, were extremely excited. Various circles initiated the organization of a comfort团 [mission] and donated 200,000 yuan, intending to bring it to the front lines to慰問 [comfort] the troops in person. The Ministry of Social Affairs has sent a telegram of commendation. (Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Direct Tax Collection Agencies to be Strengthened Soon</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A person in charge of the Direct Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance stated that the direct tax amount in this year's budget is listed as 151 million yuan. By the end of October, this amount has already been exceeded. Therefore, next year's budget will be listed as 200 million yuan. Tax rates will not be increased, but the existing organizations of the 14 provincial bureaus and 101 sub-bureaus will be strengthened, so that personnel can be regularly dispatched to巡视 [tour] and pay special attention to temporary profits made in local areas.

<h3>Gu Weijun Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Strong Chinese Fighting Power; Hope Allied Nations Expand Assistance</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, delivered a speech at the luncheon of the Clergy Association today. He expressed his enthusiastic admiration for the continuous efforts of various Christian churches in China to救济 [relieve] the sick and wounded, and strongly stated that China's作战 [warfare] and the battles of Britain and the Soviet Union are merely different aspects of the same struggle for freedom and democracy. Therefore, strengthening assistance to China to accelerate its victory is in the interest of all freedom-loving countries. Gu also solemnly stated that the political unity achieved under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang and the spiritual foundation of his作战 [warfare] can be seen in the rapid growth of the New Life Movement. Gu concluded by reiterating that the Chinese people, no matter how much suffering they encounter, are determined to continue to fight with blood and tears, at the cost of sacrifice, in order to achieve what they believe will be their final victory.</p>

<h3>German Offensive on Moscow Reaches Climax; Tank Battle Ensues in the Tula Region; Germany Claims to Have Reached Southern Crimea</h3>
<p>United Press, Kuibyshev, 5th - It is believed here today that the German formula for Moscow has entered its climax, as the third phase of terrible attacks has already begun. Major front lines surrounding the Soviet capital are under attack, with激战 [fierce battles] in both the north and south of Kalinin and Tula. Soviet observers believe that the current Nazi offensive is at its maximum intensity. As a result of seven days of bloody battles in the Tula area, the Nazis had to launch a new offensive, deploying a huge number of tanks to the battlefield. Soviet military scientists all believe that this front line is crucial to the outcome of the Moscow war. The Soviet artillery隊 [squad] has concentrated on the southern central front line,猛轰 [bombarding fiercely] the German tank隊 [squad] attempting to break through the Soviet陣綫 [lines of defense]. Commander Ulmakov, in charge of military affairs in the Tula area, has策动 [motivated] his troops to launch反攻 [counter-attacks] from time to time to harass the German army. It is heard that the German and Soviet armies are each遣调 [dispatching] huge numbers of reserves to the front lines to consolidate their positions, and that the German army seems to be attempting to defeat the entire left wing of the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - Moscow Radio announced last night that the Germans are调出 [transferring] reserves to launch new attacks near Cocks (an important transportation and industrial center halfway between Moscow and Tula, which the Germans claim to have occupied) and the Kalinin front line. The German army in Cocks is using tanks to attack, attempting to break through the Soviet阵地 [positions], but has been repelled. The reserves that the enemy rushed to the Kalinin front line are all mobile infantry and artillery隊 [squads].</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 5th - This morning, military sources disclosed that the German army in Crimea has crossed the Yela Mountains and reached the southern coast of the peninsula.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 5th - After猛烈 [fierce] bombardment, the Germans have突入 [broken into] Northern Crimea, where the terrain is flat and difficult to defend. All the people are now assisting in the defense. Intense air battles are occurring, and the sound of colliding tanks震动 [shakes] the entire area. The German army attacked several times yesterday but did not succeed.</p>
<p>TASS, Crimean Battlefield Report, 5th - A special correspondent for "Red Star" reported, "The situation in Crimea is very危 [critical]. Several days ago, the Germans突入 [broke into] our defense line and expanded the突入 [breakthrough] point. The enemy has succeeded in this respect. In the past few days, the enemy has迫 [forced] our army to retreat into Crimea, and in the central part of the Crimean peninsula, the enemy first concentrated five divisions to attack Crimea, and now has增援 [reinforced] three more divisions. The Red Army, under a wide disparity in numbers, had no choice but to retreat. According to accurate statistics, the Germans have suffered 90,000 casualties in Crimea. In addition, they have lost 150 aircraft, 100 artillery pieces, and a large number of other military supplies. Although the German army has occupied part of Crimea, the fact that they have paid a huge price is also as solid as iron."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th - Military sources here claim that the Soviet army has built three lines of defense in the Crimean Peninsula, two of which are deeper than the Maginot Line. The Soviets firmly believed that the new defensive line built in the Perekop Isthmus was sufficient to protect the Crimean Peninsula from attack. The line is divided into two parts, one north of the isthmus and one south of the isthmus, with a depth of more than 50 kilometers. The area between them is both a basin and has many obstacles and machine gun nests, making it difficult for any enemy to突入 [break into]. But the Soviet army was not satisfied with this, and rebuilt a third line of defense, from the southeast to the northeast, directly to the Hicaric River, completely closing off the highway to Sevastopol, in order to ensure the首邑 [capital] of Crimea. However, between September 24 and 29, its first line of defense was突破 [broken through] by the German army.</p>

<h3>Based on General Far East Policy, Americans Ordered to Evacuate Guam; Navy Department Submits Urgent Request to Congress to Authorize President to Declare Martial Law</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th - It was learned here yesterday that the Governor of Guam has ordered the families of naval personnel and American citizens residing in Guam to leave the island and return to the United States. The Navy Department refused to批 [approve] Guam news. However, it is widely believed that the evacuation order is based on the Navy Department's general policy of evacuating American侨民 [residents] from the Far East.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th - The Navy Department yesterday urgently requested Congress to authorize President Roosevelt to宜 [declare] martial law and abolish the bail law in Hawaii and Puerto Rico.

<p>Wavell Flew Back to India Yesterday; British Far East Defenses Continue to Strengthen</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 5th - General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, left Singapore by plane at 7:50 this morning, on his way back to India.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 5th - General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, told reporters here last night that the Far East is the right wing of India. If the Far East military situation changes slightly, especially affecting Myanmar, it would be directly related to India. India is the樞纽 [pivot] of the British Eastern defense area. He did not want to go into details, but it can be said that the Middle East is part of the entire defense area centered on India, and so is the Far East. Since the situation in the Far East was threatened, troops and equipment have been shipped to the Far East 源源 [continuously], and will continue to be shipped, but he did not want to go into detail. He had toured Myanmar and Malaya to inspect the Far East situation on the ground, and personally discussed everything with Field Marshal Brooke-Popham, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East. He also took this opportunity to see what he could do for the Indian troops stationed in Malaya. From what he saw, the Indian troops stationed here were very精神饱满 [spirited] and the environment was suitable. Wavell said of the Soviet Union that the Soviet situation was not very clear. If the German army invaded India, it would encounter a strong陣地 [position] on the Northwest border. Recently, the border陣地 [position] has been greatly strengthened, with a considerable number of troops. The Indian Command and the Soviet Army have close contact. The Soviet Union has a chief of staff stationed in India, and Indian officers often go to the Soviet Union for negotiations. A large number of supplies from India have been shipped to the Soviet Union, but no Indian troops have entered Soviet territory, because the Soviet Union has never made such a request.</p>
<p>United Press, El Salvador, 5th - David, a director of London's David Company and a arms dealer, said yesterday that Britain's defense work is extremely solid and is prepared for a five-year war. The宜 [statement] was made when David was on the China Clipper on his way to Singapore.</p>
<p>Australia Holds Important Meeting; Discussions Involve Global Issues</p>
<p>United Press, London, 5th - It was reported that extremely important military consultations are underway in Canberra, and American newspapers 称 [claim] that the British Empire's policy towards Japan has not changed. The exact nature of the Canberra meeting has not been officially disclosed, but Australian Prime Minister Curtin said that the meeting involves matters of the whole world. General Wavell, commander of the British forces in India, who inspected British military defenses in Singapore, suddenly left Malaya by plane to return to India today, after revealing that imperial troops would continue to 源源 [continuously] arrive in Singapore. A Daily Mail correspondent quoted General Wavell as saying that the threatened situation in the Far East can be expected to continue. It has been received that General Wavell originally计划 [planned] Myanmar's defenses, to do a more general inspection, but he has returned to India this morning, this 朱 [red] also points out that his leaving here is 吾 [because] of suddenly changing the plan, General Wavell, the British in the East of the阵綫 [front line], India is the hub, and the British in India's阵地 [position], Myanmar and Singapore's British military defenses as its right面 [side]翼 [wing].</p>
<p>Reuters, Melbourne, 5th - A Melbourne Press editorial criticized the visit of Duff Cooper, representative of the British War Cabinet, to Australia, recounting Cooper's promise of "no Far East Munich conference" and stating that after two months of经騐 [experience], Cooper should be prepared to go further today and verify that only the strength and determination shown by uniting to resist Japanese aggressors can deter Japan. Cooper will see that Australia has this determination more markedly than elsewhere. If Cooper feels that Australia in the Pacific British Empire policy making is 亟欲 [eager] to serve in a more important job than before, then 渠 [he] will see 吾 [that] Australians do not regardless of肩负 [shoulder] therefore the responsibilities of the start.</p>
<h3>America's Strong Stance: Unwavering Support for China, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Declares Policy Unchanged, Kurusu Sent to US to Assist in Talks</h3>
<p>Washington, 4th – Japanese newspapers have recently launched fierce attacks on the United States, and Tokyo has frequently issued unofficial warnings and threats. However, the US government has maintained complete silence, and there has been no indication of any change in America's established policy toward the Pacific region. The US has also made all necessary preparations for war with Japan if needed. The rumored crisis of November 15th, the "deadline," and the Japanese claim that US-Japan relations are entering their final stage have failed to deeply impress the American public. Instead, they have strengthened the resolve of the US government and people. Japan is aware that the worst-case scenario is war with the US, but the American people are prepared for such a war. According to well-informed sources, President Roosevelt has assured the Chongqing National Government that the US government will never sacrifice China to appease Japan. Simultaneously, the US government is rapidly completing its joint defense preparations with China, the Netherlands, Britain, and the Soviet Union to prevent the outbreak of war in the Pacific. However, the above information has not been confirmed by the White House or the State Department. While Japanese representatives in Washington have continuously strived to ease US economic sanctions against Japan, the US, Britain, and the Netherlands have shown no signs of easing their economic pressure. This move by Britain, the US, and the Netherlands has troubled Japanese leaders, who reportedly believe that Japan can no longer delay seeking a solution to the problem. Various circles here increasingly believe that America's position is becoming more favorable. Although most people feel that war between the US and Japan is unavoidable, they still believe that Japan is unwilling to risk war while the Soviet Union is still resisting German aggression. In fact, the preliminary exploratory talks between the US and Japan, which were originally suspended, are continuing but have made no progress. There has been no significant progress in the past two weeks, and the situation in the Far East is deteriorating. The United States is now adopting a policy of watchful waiting and preparing to respond to any actions Japan takes. The current issue seems not to be whether war will break out, but rather whether the US is determined to aid China, Britain, the the Netherlands and the Soviet Union in resisting further Japanese aggression.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 5th – Representative Smith, a Democratic Congressman from West Virginia, stated yesterday that he has found "no indication in Congress of succumbing to Japan's demands for a new order in Asia." He also said that Congress strongly opposes abandoning America's position in the Far East. Congress advocates maintaining its position in the Far East even more resolutely than it is determined to stop Hitler. He further stated that the US will not abandon its aid to China, which is clearly "the crux of Japan's demands."</p>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 5th – Chinese official and unofficial circles today expressed satisfaction with Washington's response to Tokyo's reported warnings. Reliable sources said that the American press's reaction and the statements by members of Congress have dispelled concerns among Chinese officials here about Washington's talks. Reliable sources here generally believe that Japan's current anti-American rhetoric is mere bluster. They believe that Japan will not take actions that would warrant American intervention. Instead, Japan will intensify its efforts in areas where the US is unlikely to intervene, namely Siberia and Yunnan Province.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 5th – Prime Minister Tojo stated today at a regular meeting of the Privy Council the government's "unwavering determination" to implement its established national policy. He said that this policy includes ending the China Incident and establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. He also requested the cooperation of the Privy Council. Privy Council Chairman Dr. Hara responded to Tojo's remarks and encouraged the government.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th – The Information Bureau announced this afternoon that Japan has dispatched former Ambassador to Germany Saburo Kurusu to Washington to assist Ambassador Nomura in the Japan-US talks. According to the Japanese news agency, a spokesman for the Information Bureau stated that this step was taken in view of the current severe situation to facilitate a successful resolution of the Japan-US talks. Kurusu has departed for Hong Kong and will take a clipper ship to the United States on November 7th. According to the spokesman, the clipper ship's departure was originally scheduled for today but was postponed because US Ambassador Grew had a direct wireless conversation with US Secretary of State Hull last night.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 5th – Domei News Agency reports that the Japanese government, in an effort to make a final diplomatic push, has decided to send Kurusu to the US. The current situation is very complex, and various issues between the US and Japan will not easily be resolved. However, most people have hopes for Kurusu's trip, believing that he will be able to thoroughly explain Japan's viability, national defense, and national prestige in various ways and facilitate a friendly resolution of the negotiations. It has been over seventy days since the US-Japan talks began. An authoritative Japanese spokesman said that Kurusu's mission is to achieve a speedy resolution of US-Japan issues.</p>
<p>Guang Zhi Times - Seven Suggestions</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 5th – Today's editorial in the "Japan Guang Zhi Times" suggests seven key points for Anglo-Japanese mediation. Observers believe this may be a semi-official disclosure of a letter from Konoe to President Roosevelt. The editorial is titled "Britain's Peace Terms."</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 5th – The "Japan Guang Zhi Times," representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' views, proposed a mediation process including seven key points in an editorial today, stating that the US should accept them. The upcoming Congress will undoubtedly adopt "air defense procedures." The newspaper stated, "It is time for a drastic change in American policy. Japan now stands for its rights and begins to break through." The newspaper's editorial stated, "Japan should not propose, but the US should initiate the following key points: (1) The US and other powers must stop sending military delegations to Chongqing, as such delegations are intended to 'keep China fighting against Japan.' (2) These powers should grant China complete freedom to negotiate with Japan, thereby ending the war and establishing economic cooperation. (3) The US should persuade China to make peace with Japan and stop the military and economic encirclement under the guise of self-defense. (4) The US should recognize Japan's 'Co-Prosperity Sphere' and Japan's leadership in the Western Pacific, allowing 'Manchukuo,' China, French Indochina, Thailand, the Dutch East Indies, and other countries or protectorates to establish political and economic relations with Japan independently, without interference. (5) The US should recognize 'Manchukuo.' (6) Japanese and Chinese funds in the US, Britain, and the Dutch East Indies, as well as locations where provocative measures are implemented, should be unconditionally and immediately unfrozen. (7) The US should restore the US-Japan trade treaty, remove all restrictions on navigation and commerce, and 'cancel all economic and military misconduct.'"</p>
<p>Japan's Psychological Warfare Against the US</p>
<p>United Press, Chongqing, 5th – Unofficial initial reactions here to the seven-point program for reconciliation with the US advocated in the "Japan Guang Zhi Times" commentary suggest that it is a declaration of all-out psychological warfare against the US. Well-informed sources said that the commentary is tantamount to an unofficial and blunt declaration of war, indicating how desperate Japan's current situation is. Unofficial sources believe that if the proposals listed in the commentary are indeed sent to Washington, they will be rejected. Simultaneously, unofficial sources stated that if Japan chooses to attack the Yunnan-Burma Road as its primary target in breaking through the so-called ABCD encirclement, then China is already prepared to join the war. An official Central Daily News commentary on US-Axis relations stated that a state of war already exists between Germany and the US and predicted that this tense relationship will develop into an undeclared war. The newspaper commentary stated, "The only resolute policy of the US is to use all possible means to aid the democratic countries at war. Anyone, anytime, anywhere, who obstructs or attempts to obstruct this aid will be destroyed and completely suppressed by the US and its allies."</p>
<h3>US President Announces "Civilian Defense Week," Implies Hard Times Ahead for America, Citizens Must Fulfill National Defense Obligations</h3>
<p>Reuters, Hyde Park, NY, 5th – President Roosevelt issued a formal proclamation yesterday, declaring November 11th to 16th as "Civilian Defense Week," implying that hard times for civilians are about to descend upon America. He also proclaimed that every American citizen must fulfill their obligations in national defense, and added that "since everyone fulfills this obligation, we should leave no doubt in anyone's mind, believe that we are now in a solid union, and intend to be in this position for a long time." "We should maintain genuine American methods to keep our lives from being enslaved by the heresies that would be dictated by world dictators. We must work longer hours to manufacture the munitions needed to defeat Hitler. Each of us should determine a necessary task in the entire national defense and be trained." The proclamation also stated that the growing strength of the Army and Navy is not enough. The proclamation concluded, "Every citizen must fulfill their obligations in national defense."</p>
<h3>British Empire Discusses Steps to Confront Axis Allies, Discussions Broad, Focus on Far East Situation</h3>

<h3>Co-Administration of Macau Denied by Both Portugal and Japan</h3>
<p>United Press, Lisbon, 5th – The government today declared that it has no knowledge of foreign reports that Japan has requested joint administration of Macau near Hong Kong.</p>

Export licenses for iron sand have been suspended since October 31st, and the High Commissioner's office has also announced that an export license system will be applied to other items.</p>
<h3>US Urges Finland to Make Peace, Britain May Declare War if Refused, Finland in Dilemma, Berlin Condemns US Interference in European Affairs</h3>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 5th – US officials believe Britain will soon declare war on Finland unless the Finnish government quickly accepts Soviet peace proposals and makes a separate peace. According to the peace proposals, which were conveyed to Helsinki by the US government on August 18th, it is reported that Britain implied that it would comply with Soviet demands and declare war on Finland unless Finland immediately ceased its attacks on Soviet territory. It is believed here that Secretary of State Hull's warning to Finland that it would lose US friendship unless it withdrew from the war was a last-ditch effort by Hull to mediate the Soviet-Finnish war before Britain declared war. However, Hull's warning has not been answered. People here generally believe that the Finns are currently in a dilemma because US officials generally believe that Germany will strongly oppose any move toward a separate Soviet-Finnish peace.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, Date not provided – German Foreign Ministry spokesman Schmidt, in a statement to reporters regarding the US government's note to Finland demanding a cessation of hostilities against the Soviet Union, said that the US government's attack on Finland was beyond reproach. The US attempt to interfere in European affairs is becoming increasingly clear.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Northward Advance, Southward Advance, and Westward Advance</h3>
<p>In the Far East, the Soviet and Japanese armies are currently facing each other across the border. The democratic front in the South Pacific is also on high alert, and news reports indicate that Japan's future movements will focus on intensifying its invasion of China. Once the emergency military budget is passed by the provisional parliament, new offensives will be launched in the northwest and southwest along different routes. In the past, Japan has faced more than two expansionist options, but one particular route has always been more dominant. Before the July 7th Incident, the focus was on attacking the Soviet Union. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the focus shifted to China. In recent years, there has been a strong desire to advance southward. However, today, it is difficult to determine which route is more important among the northward advance, southward advance, and westward advance. All three are possible, and each has its own difficulties. Therefore, deciding which route to choose is a complex issue.</p>
<p>Looking at the reality of these three routes, the Sino-Japanese War has been going on for four years and four months, and the situation remains deadlocked. Japan wants to end it but cannot. Regarding the northward advance, the Japanese army has invested the most resources and completed preparations. There have been repeated attempts to launch an offensive, but because the Soviet Union has also stationed heavy troops and is on high alert, there has been no exploitable weakness, even recently when the Soviet Union's resistance on the western front has been difficult. As for the southward advance, although it is Japan's greatest desire in recent years, preparations have been initiated latest and are the poorest, and the reaction and resistance it has aroused are the greatest. In terms of Japan's proclaimed "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," it originally included all of China, Siberia east of Lake Baikal, and all of the South Seas. However, it is not possible to encompass such a vast area in one fell swoop. Therefore, for more than a year, Japan's consistent foreign policy has been to seek the easing of one or two of these three fronts in order to concentrate its efforts on an offensive on another front. Examples include peace offensives against China, the signing of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, and the initiation of US-Japan talks. The results have been either unsuccessful, only partially successful, or still unresolved. In short, until recently, the Japanese authorities have had to divert their energy and troops to several fronts. Whether in China, the Northeast, or the South Seas, Japan has not obtained a guarantee that it can safely expand in another direction. Of course, China, in order to recover its lost territories, is naturally constantly brewing a counteroffensive. As for the Soviet Union and the democratic countries, they only seek to defend their territories and avoid invasion, and have no intention of threatening Japan. However, in the eyes of the Japanese, who are eager to expand, it is inevitable that they believe that unless the current situation is changed, it will be difficult to engage in decisive and risky actions. Especially since the formation of the Far East ABCD front, there is a greater sense of unease. In fact, the true meaning of breaking the ABCD encirclement is only to eliminate resistance and obstacles on the path of expansion.</p>
<p>Tojo's succession as Prime Minister indicates that Japan's northward advance is becoming more urgent. However, the Soviet army on the western front, despite being in an extremely unfavorable situation, has not lost its courage and confidence. The Soviet authorities continue to respond to small-scale provocations on the northeastern border with their usual firm attitude. Given these facts, it does not seem to be an appropriate time to implement a plan for a two-front war against China and the Soviet Union. Between the US and Japan, negotiations have made no progress, and Japanese public opinion has recently become extremely arrogant. Anti-American propaganda has almost reached the same level as the anti-British movement of two years ago. However, given the recent active and resolute Far East policies of Britain and the US, Japan may not actually escalate from empty threats to an actual challenge, giving the main British and American fleets, which are feeling that their heroism is going unused, a chance to prove themselves. Moreover, even amidst the extremely noisy anti-American clamor, the attempt to reach a compromise with the US has not been abandoned. From this situation, a decisive action of southward or northward advance seems too early at present. In other words, the timing and preparations are not sufficient, and "resolving the China Incident" is an important part of the preparation process.</p>
<p>Recently, Japan has amassed heavy troops on the Vietnamese border, and the Japanese army in Shanxi has also shown signs of crossing the river to look westward towards Xi'an. The purpose of this large-scale pincer offensive is naturally partly to relieve the constraints of a future northward or southward advance. However, in terms of the Sino-Japanese War itself, it will be the most important battle since the Battle of Wuhan. The target of this pincer offensive is precisely the north and south endpoints of the "ceasefire line" previously mentioned by Itagaki. For the past three years, successive Japanese authorities have only dealt with the Sino-Japanese war situation piecemeal and made political and diplomatic probes. They seem to have lost confidence in the path of military resolution. However, after Tojo took office, he first announced "seeking a victorious resolution to the war against China," and immediately decided to convene parliament to request the passage of additional war funds for China. Militarily, he has again mobilized heavy troops to watch over Shaanxi and Yunnan. Whether he has the strength to carry out this plan and whether he can revitalize the long-fatigued military is yet to be seen. This future battle has very significant implications for the future of the war against China and the safety of the Far East in general. Whether Japan can truly carry out its southward or northward advance depends entirely on how this battle ends.</p>
<p>The so-called southward advance, northward advance, and westward advance are by no means three separate matters, but rather several forms of Japan's expansion policy. Especially since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war and the US increasingly approaching war, the safety of various parts of the Far East has formed a whole problem, and the Sino-Japanese war is the main key. After the recent battles in northern Hunan and northern Henan, the Chinese army's belief in victory has been further enhanced. In addition, with the constant supply of war equipment and manpower from various friendly countries, it is believed that it will be able to demonstrate its new achievements in the future war of defending its territory. However, if Japan truly launches a new offensive, it will definitely be deliberate in its attempts to succeed, and should not be overly ignored. This is something that not only China itself must be greatly vigilant about.</p>

<h3>American Warships in the Atlantic Search for German Submarines According to Participants, Several Have Been Sunk</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 5th - Since President Roosevelt issued the "shoot on sight" order two months ago, American warships patrolling the Atlantic have been actively searching for German submarines. Today, the "New York Sun" reported that, according to naval sources, ships patrolling the Atlantic have been frequently attacked by German submarines in recent weeks. In several instances, American sailors witnessed submarine parts floating to the surface after being hit by depth charges. Recently, Washington has received numerous reports from officers and sailors who actually participated in the attacks and witnessed the results, sufficient to dispel the impression that, in the U.S.-German struggle for control of the Atlantic, only the United States has suffered casualties. Although the U.S. government has repeatedly remained silent, there are still many signs in Washington that the losses suffered by the German side are far greater than any damage inflicted on U.S. patrol ships by submarines. A large warship of the U.S. Atlantic patrol fleet recently discovered five German submarines in two hours and believes it sank two of them. The report also stated that the submarines currently used by Germany are all new models, less than half the size of the old, large submarines, and are protected by extremely thick steel plates, so depth charges cannot inflict fatal damage unless they hit directly. Washington naval sources estimate that Germany has a total of 300 such submarines, with half (150) operating in the Atlantic at any given time, and the other half refueling and undergoing repairs.</p>
<p>Reuters, Toronto, 5th - Canadian Naval Minister Macdonald stated that German submarines are currently active in the waters off the coast of Newfoundland.</p>
<h3>Czech People in Dire Straits Under Nazi Rule Tens of Thousands of Czechs Killed, 200 Yugoslav Hostages Executed</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 5th - A spokesman for the Czech government-in-exile stated yesterday that since the German authorities began carrying out retaliatory measures against the Czech people, 335 Czech leaders have been executed in the past five weeks. He also stated that another 1,095 Czechs have been sentenced to imprisonment and hard labor for life. As for the number of civilians executed, it is certainly more than this number. He further stated that the victims include generals, students, doctors, professors, and politicians. He also said that since the German invasion of Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of Czechs have been killed, but a detailed count is not possible because "we can only confirm the deaths of the more prominent Czechs."</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 5th - CBS radio reported yesterday, after the assassination of a German soldier named Jung Lebrubed, that 100 hostages have been executed.</p>
<h3>Afghanistan Maintains Friendship with Soviet Union German and Italian Nationals Expelled</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - Moscow Radio last night broadcast Soviet spokesman Lozovsky's remarks on Soviet-Afghan relations, stating that the Soviet Union has no political or territorial ambitions in Afghanistan and will continue to vigorously maintain political friendship and cooperation with Afghanistan for the benefit of both countries. The activities of Italian and German nationals in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union and Afghanistan have intensified since the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Because of the hostile activities of the German and Italian nationals, the Soviet government urged the Afghan government to pay attention to the treaty signed on June 4, 1931, and requested that the Afghan government order the German and Italian nationals to leave the country immediately. The Afghan government decided to accept the Soviet government's advice and purge German and Italian special agents from the country. This event demonstrates the existence of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 5th - One hundred and six nationals from Axis countries, including 78 German and 27 Italian nationals, have left North-West Frontier Province for their home countries. The German nationals include 77 men, 59 women, and 42 children. The Italian nationals include 10 men, 5 women, and 13 children. One person, named Xu Luote, is unable to travel due to illness.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Nationals Arrested in England</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th - It has been learned that two Japanese nationals have been arrested in England, one named Suzuki in Karachi, India, and one named Matsunaga in Yangon. The reasons for the arrests are still unknown. Recently, two British nationals, Mason and Mathiel, were also arrested in Japan. According to Reuters diplomatic sources, the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has approached the new Japanese government regarding this matter. The Japanese Foreign Minister, Togo, has promised to investigate and respond as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Government Rice Still Scarce on the Market New Regulations Shake the Rice Market Prices Fall Sharply by About Ten Yuan Due to Various Factors Government Rice Supply is Continuous, But Purchase Still Difficult</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice prices suddenly plummeted, something that rice merchants never anticipated. Small-grained rice fell by fourteen or fifteen yuan, while other types of rice fell by twelve, thirteen, or fourteen yuan. The market remained weak, and only now is there a glimmer of hope for the future of the rice market. The reasons for the decline are: (1) a sharp drop in gold prices; (2) the Shanghai Municipal Council's authority to manage the market for daily necessities has been approved by the Consular Body, and merchants dealing in daily necessities such as rice and flour will be required to report the quantity and storage locations of their goods, as well as regulations on sales prices, which caused panic among hoarders, who feared that their rice would be requisitioned and sold at fixed prices, and therefore dared not hoard any more; (3) rumors that the Shanghai Municipal Council has been approved by the Stabilization Fund to provide US$2.2 million for rice purchases; (4) the Shanghai Municipal Council's actions have received sympathy and support from all parties, creating considerable pressure; (5) government rice is arriving daily, and accumulated stocks are increasing, making it easier to meet the needs of the entire city and improve the current sporadic situation, causing rice hoarders to feel apprehensive; (6) stricter market supervision and warnings from the guilds have greatly reduced the activity of scalpers; (7) discussions among insurance companies to stop insuring goods in hoarded warehouses have also dealt a fatal blow to speculators. As a result, market prices have fallen sharply repeatedly. Small-grained English rice fell to 194 yuan. Existing rice fell from 170 yuan to 158 yuan, then to 154 or 155 yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice fell from 198 yuan to 188 yuan. All other types of rice also fell. Transactions totaled less than 10,000 bags.</p>
<p>Although Shanghai Municipal Council rice is arriving in port one after another, it is still rarely seen on the market, so that as soon as word spreads that Shanghai Municipal Council rice has arrived at a store, crowds immediately gather. Yesterday morning, from Xinzha Road, Zhejiang Road, Daxin Street, and Dongxin Bridge, through the French Concession along the Route 21 bus line, directly to Route Ghisi, Father Jin Road, then to Avenue Albert, Henry Road, Route Lauer, Route Picard, Route Seymour, and finally to Route Yu Yuen, only one store near North Hai Road on Route Hupeh was selling Shanghai Municipal Council rice. The people waiting to buy rice, starting from the front of the store, went south and west to the front of the Longtai store, numbered 332 people. However, those who had not been numbered still continued to the middle section of Route Hsinkuang, not far from the beginning. In addition, only one rice store was seen on Route Lauer with a sign saying "Shanghai Municipal Council rice sold out." Nothing else was seen. Around 6 p.m., a rice store at the east end of Avenue Edward VII began selling Shanghai Municipal Council rice, and more than 100 people had gathered to wait. Currently, since rice stores are not selling Shanghai Municipal Council rice, ordinary working families cannot compete with the aggressive hawkers and the fierce Jiangbei mothers for a share of the rice. They can only painfully buy high-priced rice from the rice stores. Some rice stores have even emptied their stores, claiming to have no rice, while others have raised prices to sell. Some went to buy rice in the morning for 182 yuan, but in the afternoon were asked for 186 yuan. However, the overall market fell by 11 or 12 yuan yesterday, showing that rice stores raise prices in line with the overall market, but ignore the overall market when prices fall.</p>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice continue to arrive in Shanghai. In recent days, large quantities of foreign rice have arrived in port, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Kwangtung ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying 13,071 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, berthing at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Among them, 10,200 bags were Shanghai Municipal Council's small-grained rice. It is reported that large quantities are still on their way to Shanghai. (Zu)</p>
<p>Although the arrival of thick and thin japonica rice is still not strong, due to the sharp drop in foreign rice prices, sales in local stores are not smooth, so the resulting selling prices have also softened. The initial high price of Kunshan new japonica rice was 205 or 206 yuan, especially 207 or 208 yuan, then 202 or 203 yuan. Qingjiao Kiln seed was 202.5 yuan or 202 yuan. Lv seed was 205 or 206 yuan. Nangang early paddy was 204 yuan, sub-entire paddy was 200 yuan, and New Dujian was 188 yuan, down about 3 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice, Hong Kong goods are still selling well due to the shortage of goods on the market, opening high from 218 yuan down to 215 yuan, Glutinous tea 200 yuan, Guoglutinous then due to the source has been opened, and goods are inferior, popular heart quite lax, sold 206 yuan,</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour Also Cannot Hold</h3>
<p>Although there was no official market for wheat flour yesterday, affected by the sharp fall in gold and rice prices, secret transactions were rare and prices fell, and sentiment was weak, so prices may fall further. If insurance companies stop insuring warehoused flour, then the future market may have difficulty supporting high prices. Yesterday, Golden Dragon fell from 57.5 yuan to 56 yuan. Fort brand opened at 59.5 yuan and 59 yuan, but there were few takers. However, bran, due to shortages, rose to 59 yuan. Guest bran opened at 57 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Should Have Fallen, But Ruthless Buying Prevails</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council will have the actual power to control various daily necessities in Shanghai, the prices of general commodities such as rice, flour, paper, cigarettes, oil, and soap have fluctuated and fallen sharply. Although sugar is under manipulation, it has also fallen to its limit. Although gold prices have fallen, the banks that are causing the trouble are buying at low prices, causing the prices to rebound. If gold prices do not fall, commodity prices will be supported and there will still be times when they fall slightly but rise sharply. It can be seen that the biggest reason for disrupting the lives of the masses is the purchasers of gold who disregard the welfare of the masses.</p>
<p>Spot gold is still being traded in the black market and over the phone. The market price first fell and then rebounded slightly. It once plummeted to below the 20,000 yuan mark, because a certain gold shop and a certain silver shop, on behalf of the Nanjing gang, were selling fiercely. Sentiment was slightly weak and uncertain. In the early morning, it opened 100 yuan lower, at 20,600 yuan. A certain silver shop and a remittance merchant bought some, but the spot gold shop sold hundreds of taels, and the gold shop and another silver shop competed to sell. After 9:55 a.m., a sharp fall began, plummeting 1,300 yuan, breaking into the 20,000 yuan mark, and there were even fewer buyers. At 10:35 a.m., it fell to a low of 19,300 yuan. There were quite a few transactions at this price. The silver shop suddenly came back and bought, and the securities firms also bought when they saw the low price. When they saw that the gold shop was also buying, prices rebounded, rising 1,100 yuan to 20,400 yuan. At noon, prices fell again, to 20,200 yuan at noon. In the early afternoon, prices fell again to around 20,000 yuan. A certain firm was still buying, raising prices to 20,400 or 20,500 yuan, before closing. Due to weak sentiment, prices fell again to 20,200 yuan at around 4 p.m., down another 500 yuan from the previous day. It has fallen for three consecutive days, for a total of 2,400 yuan. There was a high and low of 1,300 yuan that day. Trading was not light. The spot gold shop's own-brand gold was sold for 20,500 yuan, with buying reduced by about 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry in silver shops, the Great Harmony and New Harmony shops, first listed a small four-decisive, down a total of 160 yuan, falling to 1,960 yuan. At noon, prices rebounded twice, rising 100 yuan, to 1,060 yuan (buying reduced by 150 yuan). Rolled small 60 yuan, silver without listed prices, black market prices have done small 5 yuan, for 78 yuan cloud,</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Manages Prices, Rapid Progress in Progress Control Prices Have Concrete Measures, Urging Firms to Join the Importers Association</h3>
<p>A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated yesterday morning (5th) that the Council has been meeting daily to discuss price management matters for two weeks. Now, with the new bylaws approved by the Consular Body, it has a huge club as a weapon, and price management will be accelerated. Detailed methods for regulating prices are still under discussion and will be decided soon. At the same time, importers in the city welcomed the Municipal Council's authority to punish profiteering retailers. A certain American businessman stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council has now obtained all the powers it has been seeking and only needs to use them well. Other importers reserved their opinions on how effective the Shanghai Municipal Council's actions will be, but all believed that the new bylaws have given the Municipal Council the powers it has long needed. The importers also stated that they will fully cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council to curb the profiteering behavior of retailers.</p>
<p>About to be implemented Fixed Prices</p>
<p>Since the Consular Body approved the new bylaws of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, the Shanghai Municipal Council can now fix prices for various goods and announce them for implementation at any time, and crack down on speculation and profiteering. As for the specific methods, they are roughly as follows: regardless of whether it is an individual or a partnership, when selling necessities and retail goods designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council, they must make extremely detailed records of (1) the maximum inventory and storage location; (2) the purchase price and date; (3) the sales price, quantity, and sales status, so that the Shanghai Municipal Council can send personnel to investigate and engage in price control. As for the maximum price limit for each retail commodity, it will be determined by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Importers Association. Once this maximum price is announced, it must not be changed arbitrarily. Retail merchants must also issue detailed invoices to customers for the type, quantity, and price of necessities purchased for verification.</p>
<p>Promote Importers to Join the Association</p>
<p>According to a public announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office, regarding the Bureau's proposal to establish an Importers and Manufacturers Association, which was previously announced, the Bureau now requests that all firms that agree in principle with the organization of this association, as soon as possible, send a letter to Becker &amp; Co., No. 17 The Bund, indicating the names of the products that each firm operates and can manage in accordance with the measures announced by the Bureau on October 31. As for retail merchants willing to cooperate with this price management plan that benefits the public, please also quickly inform the ocean firm to work together to promote progress.</p>
<p>Bulk Commodities will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>According to several merchants, all foreign merchants in the city expressed their gratitude to the Consular Body for approving the new bylaws, which give the Shanghai Municipal Council actual power, and they hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will make good use of it to eliminate hoarding and profiteering. They have high hopes for the Stabilization Fund's policies and hope that the Importers Association can improve the allocation of foreign exchange needed by Shanghai's merchants. It is said that a large number of commodities are currently being shipped to China, enough for a year's needs. At the same time, they are also shipping fabrics to Free China, which are in great demand by Free China's hospitals and charities.</p>
<p>Importers will Fully Cooperate</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post said that major foreign importers are now watching the Shanghai Municipal Council's efforts to suppress prices and are launching their own campaigns against profiteering retailers. If the methods are universally applied, they will certainly eradicate all the ills of hoarding and profiteering of necessities. In summary, the method is to use public assistance to monitor retail stores and ensure that they sell goods at prices stipulated by importers. If they do not follow the stipulated prices and ignore warnings, the supply of goods will be stopped. Finally, importers can also sell goods directly to the public to avoid profiteering by intermediaries.</p>
<p>Jishi Ocean Firm Takes Steps</p>
<p>Many import firms have already decided to handle everything themselves and cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council. One of them is the American firm Jishi Ocean Firm, which sells Klim milk powder, which is also a necessity and can obtain foreign exchange at the official exchange rate. The firm's manager, Mr. Ballentine, recently told reporters that the firm's method of distributing Klim milk powder has already been imitated by importers of other necessities. The two prerequisites for improving the city's price situation are the provision of foreign exchange at the official exchange rate and the adjustment of shipping conditions. Shipping conditions deteriorated last month, so a batch of Klim milk powder that should have arrived in Shanghai last month is now expected to arrive at the end of this month. Klim milk powder currently has enough inventory to meet the city's needs for three months.</p>
<p>Effective Measures to Sanction Profiteering</p>
<p>Jishi Ocean Firm's method of curbing profiteering by retailers is to use wireless radio to inform the public that its stipulated prices are 16 yuan for a one-pound can, 31.5 yuan for a two-and-a-half-pound can, and 70 yuan for a five-pound can. Since the firm has obtained foreign exchange allocated by the Stabilization Fund, it sells goods to retailers at legal tender prices, which have not changed in the past three months. If unscrupulous merchants raise prices, customers will definitely hear the wireless radio broadcast and send letters to inform Jishi Ocean Firm. In order to thank them, the firm will sell milk powder directly to the customer and then send a letter to the accused retail store to warn them.</p>
<p>Discover Hoarding Stop Supplying Goods</p>
<p>If, after a few days, it is found that they ignore this warning, the supply of goods will be stopped immediately. Another problem is that retail stores claim that the goods have been sold out. When Jishi Ocean Firm learns of this, it will send a representative to investigate their accounts and inventory. If hoarding is discovered, a warning will be given. If it is not effective, the supply of goods will also be stopped. Several large stores have therefore been refused supplies by Jishi Ocean Firm, and the firm will set up its own retail department on Route Yu Yuen to sell directly. So far, this method of suppressing the price of Klim milk powder has been quite effective.</p>
<p>Police Authorities Punish Severely</p>
<p>Mr. Ballentine also praised the work of the French Concession Police Department, saying that the French Police Department investigates retail stores on its own and, based on information provided by Jishi Ocean Firm, fines unscrupulous merchants as much as 500 yuan. Now that the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession has also formulated new bylaws and obtained the same powers, it is hoped that the Public Concession Police Department will also take a tough stance. Profiteering by Klim milk powder retailers is far less common in the French Concession than in the Public Concession. One problem is that citizens hoard for their own use due to soaring prices, which directly stimulates prices to soar. Therefore, Jishi Ocean Firm recently stipulated that retail stores must open the cans when selling Klim milk powder, so that it can only be stored for a maximum of two months.</p>
<h3>工部局積極調劑粉市　籌設麥粉平賣會</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to regulate the flour market, has applied to the Exchange Equalisation Fund Committee for statutory foreign exchange to directly order foreign flour for sale in Shanghai. The council has scheduled a meeting of wholesale flour merchants from the two concessions at 2:00 PM on the 10th of this month (Monday) in the council's conference room at No. 209 Jiangxi Road to discuss the organization of the "Shanghai Wheat Flour Price Stabilization Committee" and to arrange for advances for ordering foreign flour. Once the ordered foreign flour arrives in Shanghai, it will be sold at a fair price under the strict management of the council. The sale price will also be determined by the council. Wholesale flour merchants from the two concessions who wish to attend the above meeting should notify the General Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council at No. 209 Jiangxi Road before 4:00 PM on the 7th of this month for verification. Details can be found in the council's announcement today.</p>

<p>The Rice Merchants, Tea Houses and Market Management Committee, in order to crack down on illegal transactions in the market and to promote the industry's buying and selling towards a proper path, specifically convened the 92nd committee meeting to discuss good policies. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to strictly prohibit off-the-books transactions in the market. All buying and selling in the market must be limited to actual sales, etc., as recorded in the minutes. Yesterday, a special announcement was made to the market: "Upon investigation, rice prices continue to rise unabated. If this is not stopped, it will have a profound impact on the people's food supply. Therefore, after deliberation at the 92nd meeting of this committee, it was decided that from now on, buying and selling in this market should comply with the market regulations, earnestly follow the order of transactions, and be based on actual sales. Customers with stock are advised to sell it as soon as possible. Brokers should also pay attention and take actual sales as the main goal, so that fair market prices can be based on this. If anyone does not follow the regulations and engages in unauthorized skillful operations, once discovered, they will be reported to the authorities for sanctions and severe punishment. It is hoped that everyone will abide by this and not mislead themselves or others. This is the announcement."</p>
<p>發售平米　擴大範圍</p>
<p>Fair-Priced Rice Distribution Expanded</p>
<p>In order to actively find ways to suppress and stabilize rice prices, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession immediately contacted the Hong Kong government back and forth by telegram to continue shipping large quantities of Rangoon special small polished rice for widespread fair-priced sale in this city. It is reported that since last week, more than 70,000 bags of fair-priced rice have been continuously shipped and have now been distributed by various contracting foreign firms to various rice shops for fair-priced sale at the door according to regulations. It is now known that from 3:00 PM yesterday, most of the rice shops have already taken the fair-priced rice out of the warehouse and sold it at the door. However, the poor people carried broken containers to scramble for Hong Kong rice at the respective rice shops, resulting in the rice shop staff being unable to cope with the large number of people.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has issued another announcement stating that rice and grain of any quality or quantity may not be transported out of the Public Concession (except to the French Concession) without first obtaining a special permit from the council's police department. If any rice and grain is carried or transported out of the Public Concession without the council's permit, it will be confiscated on the spot by the patrolmen. The council has repeatedly notified all merchants and people in the city about the prohibition, but there are still some unscrupulous merchants who secretly smuggle it, which has a significant impact on the people's food reserves. Therefore, the council hopes that all residents of the city will work together to curb this smuggling trend, as this matter is of great importance.</p>
<p>昨日米價　直綫下瀉</p>
<p>Yesterday's Rice Prices Plummeted</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions have taken emergency measures to actively find ways to suppress and stabilize rice prices, speculative rice merchants have been dealt a head-on blow and are unable to be active. At the same time, all rice shops have resumed the distribution of fair-priced Hong Kong rice and have no intention of adding expensive spot goods to the market, resulting in a sharp drop in actual sales in the market. However, major households are trying to sell their hoarded goods for cash at this high price, increasing the supply of spot goods, while the way out is stagnant. People's hearts are wavering and attention is difficult to determine. The rice market began to plummet yesterday. Small polished rice fell by fourteen or fifteen yuan compared to the previous market. The market situation will be more lenient today. It is reported that general non-industry speculative unscrupulous merchants have suffered severe blows.</p>
<h3>大量米棉　昨今到滬</h3>
<p>Large quantities of rice and cotton arrived in Shanghai yesterday and today.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's fair-priced foreign rice, another 10,200 bags arrived in Shanghai yesterday, transported from Hong Kong by the Taikoo Company's Guangdong wheel. In addition, there were 2,871 bags of passenger and freight foreign rice, totaling 13,071 bags. The wheel docked at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>The Panamanian wheel "Virginia" managed by the British firm Scharoulsen, transported more than 5,500 pieces of cotton from the South American port of Cebu and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning, docking at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading. In addition, "Wawa" also transported more than 7,000 pieces of cotton from Cebu and needs to postpone arrival, about next Monday to Shanghai. It is heard that the cotton was purchased by a certain Jewish merchant at No. 190 Beijing Road in this city.</p>
<h3>英僑婦孺　撤退登記</h3>
<p>British women and children in Shanghai are rushing to register for evacuation at the British Consulate's evacuation department, following the British authorities' evacuation advice issued a few days ago (4th). This registration procedure will end on November 15th. When the reporter inquired with the British officials in charge of the evacuation plan about this matter, they were all silent. However, people generally believe that due to the tense situation in the Pacific, the British will be able to obtain ships to transport the registered British overseas Chinese from Shanghai.</p>

<h3>烟兌業公會昨籌商　整頓買賣業規　今日起恢復同業交易　通告嚴禁非會員入場</h3>
<p>The Tobacco Exchange Guild discussed yesterday reorganizing the industry rules for buying and selling and will resume industry transactions starting today. A notice strictly prohibits non-members from entering.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Guild, in order to crack down on illegal transactions in the market and stabilize the overall market situation, previously stipulated industry trading methods in the market and notified all members of the industry on record. Now, due to the participation of speculative unscrupulous merchants outside the industry in transactions, and the abuse of the market by people in the industry, the selling prices of various daily necessities and cigarettes have changed several times a day, which is extremely harmful to people's livelihoods. The association, in view of its responsibilities, could not bear to sit idly by. In addition to announcing the suspension of market transactions for three days, it also convened a general meeting of industry representatives at the Ningbo Road Club at 3:30 PM yesterday. Chairman Shen Yanting reported the purpose of the meeting and earnestly advised all members of the industry not to hoard goods, not to hoard for profit, and to focus on people's livelihoods and jointly seek to stabilize the market situation. Then, the industry rules for buying and selling in the market were discussed until the meeting ended at 4:15. The discussed methods need time to be organized, and may be announced and implemented today.</p>
<p>嚴禁非會員入市塲</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Non-Members from Entering the Market</p>
<p>After the tobacco exchange market was closed from the 3rd, it has now expired and resumed trading. The association issued a special announcement to the market yesterday, "For the matter of notification, it is found that the number of people in this market has suddenly increased, and it is extremely crowded, hindering the market non-fresh. There are not a few non-members mixed in, resulting in chaotic order. In order to maintain the market, this association stipulates that from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM and from 1:00 PM to 3:30 PM every day, members must follow the rules and bring their access card photos with them to enter the market for business. Those without access cards from this association, and regardless of who they are, will not be allowed to enter within the stipulated time, and it is forbidden to bring non-members in, in order to maintain order. I hope all members of the industry will be aware of this. This announcement."</p>
<p>售價上騰操縱所致</p>
<p>Rising Prices Caused by Manipulation</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Society learned from those familiar with the tobacco exchange market yesterday that the stocks of various daily necessities are not scarce at present. However, this phenomenon (finished products) is mostly manipulated by black-hearted unscrupulous merchants, resulting in a reduction in the number of spot chips in the market, making it difficult for buyers to purchase, and people's hearts are not without panic. The selling prices have been frequently raised, which is unprecedented in history. First, the market prices of soap and matches on the 3rd of this month are copied as follows: (1) Matches: Beauty brand 2,080 yuan per box, Phoenix brand 2,030 yuan per box. (2) Soap: Guben 110 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao 102 yuan per box, Huang Xiangmao 96 yuan per box. It is reported that the rapid increase in selling prices this time has resulted in extremely rich profits for various tobacco exchange shops.</p>
<p>派貨批發亟宜改良</p>
<p>The Distribution of Goods and Wholesale Should Be Improved</p>
<p>It is found that there are many tobacco and paper shops in Shanghai, and it is difficult to accurately estimate the size. More than half of them can enjoy the factory's right to distribute goods, while the rest cannot enjoy the above-mentioned rights due to capital or other reasons, so they have to wholesale from wholesalers. However, compared with the distribution of goods and wholesale, the price difference is huge. Therefore, the so-called big profit is definitely not something that small tobacco exchange shops can enjoy. What needs to be urgently paid attention to is that the factory's distribution of goods should be fairly distributed according to the amount of sales, and the wholesale prices should also be corrected to be uniform. (The market actually has every 500 or 250 pieces. This wholesaler, the same goods, the price difference is five to seven or eight cents, etc.) The retail prices should also be stipulated to be uniform (except for bars and entertainment venues). Now, try to give one or two ordinary examples for comparison. "Old Knife", the distribution price is 3,180 yuan for 50,000 pieces, "Five Flowers", the distribution price is 10 yuan for 50,000 pieces, the wholesale price is 2,080 yuan for 50,000 pieces, the retail price of Old Knife is 55 cents to 7 cents per small package, and the retail price of Five Flowers is 38 cents to 45 cents per small package. After that, I hope that if the authorities decide to suppress prices, they must judge the method of governance, and it is not a good idea to deliberately stop retail.</p>
<h3>德貨船易名　航界詫異　已載貨駛返日本</h3>
<p>German Cargo Ship Renamed: Shipping Circles Surprised, Already Loaded with Cargo and Sailed Back to Japan</p>
<p>Shanghai Times reported that the German cargo ship Guido, now chartered by the Japanese Navy and renamed Tenryu Maru, quietly entered the Huangpu River on the night of October 28. After being loaded with diesel fuel, it left Shanghai at the end of last week. It is heard that it sailed back to Japan. It is found that when the ship arrived in this port flying the Japanese flag, it surprised the shipping industry, all suspecting it to be a supply ship for German raiding ships in the Pacific. Because the ship's name has been painted over and it is painted in gray-green camouflage. Although a Japanese Navy spokesman called this statement "completely unfounded," he did not give a satisfactory answer to the ship's true purpose in coming to Shanghai. Another Japanese official admitted that the crew of the Tenryu Maru included both Japanese and German people, but said that the sailors were mostly Japanese.</p>

<p>Former Editor of Russian Times Arrested: Rumored to be Related to Assassination Case, Japanese Gendarmerie Investigating Reorganization of the Newspaper</p>
<p>The English Great American Evening Post reported that a Japanese military spokesman here disclosed last night (4th) that Japanese Lieutenant Kuroki, the former editor of the Japanese-run Russian Times, was arrested by the Japanese Gendarmerie a week ago. This morning (5th), the Japanese authorities remained silent about Kuroki's continued detention. The reason for Kuroki's arrest is not yet known. It is rumored that he may be related to the conspiracy to assassinate Rogoff, president of the Shanghai TASS News Agency. It is said that Kuroki was arrested for being involved in the newspaper's finances before resigning from the post of editor of the Russian Times five months ago. According to a spokesman for the Japanese Army here, the Japanese Gendarmerie is currently investigating the reorganization of the Russian Times. It is heard that the Japanese Gendarmerie has also arrested several Russian staff members of the newspaper, and Russian Savinziv, who succeeded Kuroki as editor, is also among those arrested. Non-official Japanese said this morning that Kuroki was only detained and questioned about certain things that happened in the Russian language after he resigned. According to the Russian Times, formerly known as the Far East Times, it was run by the Japanese authorities here. Earlier this year, it launched fierce attacks on the Shanghai Municipal Council and Shanghai Jews. Russian Mamantov, who was assassinated in the French Concession about two months ago, used to work for the newspaper.</p>

<p>Xiesheng Rice Shop Sued for Refusing to Sell Fair-Priced Rice: Two Shop Assistants Detained Pending Sentencing, Boss Liu Guoan Arrested in Another Case</p>
<p>In recent times, the prices of all goods have been expensive and endless. The reason for this is nothing more than the manipulation and monopoly of speculators and the hoarding and speculation of the wealthy. Rice is related to the people's food supply. The current highest white rice japonica has exceeded the 200 yuan mark per burden. The Shanghai Municipal Council authorities, who maintain social security, in view of this, run fair-priced rice and distribute it to various rice shops for sale to help the poor people. However, a group of rice shop owners who only seek profit hide the fair-priced rice privately and then sell it at high prices. The government has long been aware of this trick and has promulgated emergency regulations for the management of agriculture, mining, industry and commerce. Courts at all levels will make judgments according to the emergency regulations when they encounter the above-mentioned situations. Xiesheng Rice Shop at No. 171-173 Chongqing Road, opened by Liu Guoan, (It is found that Liu has been arrested and is currently under trial for another case.) The shop deliberately hid four bags of fair-priced rice when selling fair-priced rice the other day,</p>
<p>Refused to Sell: After someone reported it to the Chengdu Road Patrol Room, Chinese Deputy Detective Jiang Mouzheng and Detective Xu Dezhong were dispatched to investigate and verify the truth. The shop assistant Wang Youlin, a native of Zhenjiang, was arrested and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Patrol Room lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted according to Article 12 of the Emergency Regulations (designated enterprises and goods, their producers or operators shall not have speculative monopolies or other manipulative acts) and Article 31 (violating the provisions of Article 12, and having speculative monopolies, or their</p>
<p>Manipulative Acts: those who commit any of the manipulative acts shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years, and shall also be fined one to three times the proceeds). The case was presented and the defendant was questioned. His statement was evasive. Judge Zhong checked the confession and ordered Wang to be detained pending a rescheduled sentencing on the 8th. The request for bail was not allowed. Also, Liu Guoan, the owner of the Xiesheng Rice Shop, and Qin Wentao, the owner of the Guanghua Rice Shop of the same number, both natives of Zhenjiang, ordered 100 bags of tribute rice from Qian Wangsheng, the owner of Wansheng Rice Shop at No. 8, Lane 29, Xinzha Bridge Road, at the Qinglian Pavilion on Fuzhou Road No. 515</p>
<p>Rice Market on the 25th of last month at 11:00 AM, at a price of 169 yuan per bag. By the afternoon, Qian went to collect the deposit from Liu and Qin. It turned out that the rice price had fallen by three or four yuan at that time, so the two discussed with Qian to regret the transaction, so this transaction was cancelled invisibly. Unexpectedly, on the 27th, the market price suddenly rose sharply, rising by about 10 yuan per bag. Unexpectedly, Liu and Qin saw</p>
<p>Profits to be Made: Suddenly demanded the original 100 bags of rice from Qian. Qian refused at the time. Until the morning of the 28th, when Qian arrived at the rice market, dozens of gangsters suddenly surrounded Qian, beat him fiercely, and forced him to deliver the rice, otherwise he would have to compensate for the loss of 1,000 yuan. One of them even showed a pistol to intimidate him. Seeing this, Chinese detective Mao Guodou, who was stationed in the market by the Political Department, immediately reported to the Old Gate Patrol Room by telephone. Chinese detective Zhao Zifeng and Western detectives rushed to the scene, while the gangsters had already</p>
<p>Hearing the news and fled: Only the instigators Liu Guoan and Qin Wentao were detained and sent to the First Special Court for trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin opened the First Criminal Court for trial. Patrol Room lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted the crime of intimidation and attempted fraud. After the information from Judge Fu, he ordered a rescheduling for further verification.</p>

<p>Husband's Kidney Deficiency and Weakness, Wife's Heart Filled with Unfillable Resentment</p>
<p>Hoping to Marry an Oil Seller * Deep Marital Affection and Profound Love</p>
<p>Unwilling to Falsely Act as a Wealthy Family's Wife * Wasting Youth in Vain</p>
<p>Externally Gold and Jade, Internally Rotten Floss - This is how the ancients ridiculed those who are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. If a man only has a majestic appearance but lacks a healthy physique, what difference is there from an embroidered pillow? If a man with strong essence and energy marries a delicate and beautiful woman, they will surely have deep affection and intimate feelings. Like mandarin ducks playing in the water, how can it not make people envious? Originally, sexual health is the cornerstone of the union of male and female love. Couples with healthy sexual function are like birds flying wing to wing, inseparable in form and shadow. They give birth to sons and daughters, enjoying unparalleled happiness. However, if a woman marries a husband with kidney deficiency and physical weakness, resulting in an unfulfilled sex life, how can she not feel heartbroken and filled with resentment? The wife's youth is wasted, and the husband's heart also cannot bear it. Or, the wife may even file for divorce, and the family's happiness will also be destroyed. How can this not be frightening?</p>
<p>However, how does a man become kidney deficient? This is mostly due to a man's early indulgence in masturbation, leading to nocturnal emission. The vas deferens becomes widened and loose, unable to control seminal fluid, and over time, premature ejaculation develops. At this point, if treatment is still delayed, the corpus cavernosum will be damaged and turn into impotence. By this point, sexual function is almost completely destroyed, the sexual organ is short and small, there is dizziness and headache, neurasthenia, tinnitus and blurred vision, insomnia and nocturnal emission, back pain, memory decline, dull thinking, faltering will, fatigue and tiredness, restless heartbeat, no progress in studies, and no success in career. What is even more tragic is the smallness of the penis, or impotence, premature ejaculation, leading to infertility, marital discord, and no happiness after marriage.</p>
<p>However, due to customs in our country, people suffering from hidden venereal diseases are ashamed to seek medical attention. Therefore, they delay treatment, eventually leading to premature death. But now is an era of scientific advancement, and medical progress is even more astonishing. Even kidney deficiency, which was previously considered an incurable disease, can now be treated with medication. Anyone suffering from the above symptoms only needs to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Essence), which can eliminate all of them completely. This preparation is extracted from the gonads of strong animals such as orangutans and sea dogs, and then refined using scientific methods, so its quality is pure and noble, and its medicinal properties are mild and kingly. After taking it, it can generate essence and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate blood, revitalize function, enhance development, nourish nerves, eliminate weakness, and exert great efficacy. If you can continue to take it, you can definitely cure all of the above symptoms in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Untreated Nocturnal Emission Obstructs Happiness</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Our life's happiness is built on the strength of our bodies. And essence and blood are essential for a strong physique. Therefore, if we want to be happy, we must maintain our essence and blood. However, most modern men often ignore this point, thinking that once essence is released, it will never return, and they indulge in pleasure today and get drunk today. As a result, in their youth, they engage in dalliances and unrestrained indulgence. The health of their sexual function is destroyed, leading to nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, sperm leakage, impotence, premature ejaculation, dizziness, headache, back pain, mental distraction, lack of energy, decline in brainpower, directly affecting academic and career success. And because of the depletion of essence and blood, developmental function is also hindered. This results in short stature, light weight, small sexual organs, and inability to reproduce. Such youths not only achieve nothing in academics and career, but also cannot achieve a fulfilling sex life due to impotence and premature ejaculation. The wife is resentful, and there are no offspring. Once old, they cannot avoid feeling old and sad in vain. Indeed, such people cannot enjoy the pleasures of the bedroom and the blessings of family, and although they live, they are as good as dead. How can this not be tragic!</p>
<p>Since nocturnal emission is enough to destroy the happiness of life, it should be treated as soon as possible. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Hemitol Semen-Consolidating Tablets" is the most effective treatment. This agent not only consolidates the gate of essence, but also calms the nerves. Nocturnal emission can be cured naturally. If physical weakness has already been caused by nocturnal emission, it is necessary to also take the gonadal hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Essence) to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. It can be completely cured in a short period of time. If patients can come to our clinic in person for diagnosis by expert physicians, and then use symptomatic therapies such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Beauty: Women's Tall and Rounded Breasts Sufficient to Add Charm and Beauty</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Peonies Rely Entirely on Green Leaves for Support * Women Especially Need Healthy Breasts</p>
<p>The Book of Songs says: "A graceful lady is a gentleman's good match." This means that if a woman wants to be loved by men, she must not only have a delicate and beautiful face, but also a graceful figure. However, the essential elements of a graceful figure are nothing more than full hips, a slender waist, and a pair of tall and rounded breasts on the chest. We must not underestimate a woman's breasts, for attracting the opposite sex and captivating men depends entirely on this pair of elastic breasts! And all women with tall breasts must have healthy physiques. Due to the healthy function of the ovaries, metabolism must also be vigorous. Therefore, the skin is clean, smooth, and crystal clear, and the complexion is rosy and delicate. How can this kind of woman not make men fall in love and be captivated? On the contrary, if a woman's breasts are withered and flat due to masturbation, chest binding, leucorrhea, and irregular menstruation, even if she wears heavy makeup and bright colors, it is difficult to win the favor of men. As women, why are some fortunate and some unfortunate to such an extent?</p>
<p>However, if a woman's breasts are withered, taking the ovarian preparation "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Essence) for women can save them. This agent is carefully formulated, and its ingredients are noble. It has been tested by famous doctors in various countries around the world, and it has been proven to have mild medicinal properties and great efficacy. If you can continue to take it, it can not only make withered breasts become taller and rounder in a short period of time, but also adjust menstruation, eliminate leucorrhea, and all uterine diseases. It promotes reproductive function, enhances family happiness, invigorates metabolism, restores a rosy complexion and smooth skin, maintains youth, and strengthens marital love. It is truly the only holy medicine for modern women.</p>

<h3>The Way Out for "Old Maids"</h3>
<p>— Liu Xian</p>
<p>"Old maids" are originally an abnormal phenomenon in society, which is prevalent in large and small cities in China.</p>
<p>When a woman walks out of middle school and university, and then concentrates on laying the foundation for her own career, she does not know that her precious youth has quietly slipped away. In Chinese society, which praises "sweet sixteen" and "double ten years of age," she is often crowned with the title of "outdated product." What's more, some people love women who are gentle like "little lambs" and dependent like "little birds," but they mostly respect and stay away from these "women scholars" who "talk and laugh with ease" and are "premature and solemn."</p>
<p>In front of every young woman, there are two paths: marriage and career. Of course, many people say: "Marriage and career are not in conflict"; however, "neglecting business because of marriage" and "a woman's dedication to her career leading to family misfortune" are common facts. In the situation where both cannot be taken care of, some women resolutely embark on the lonely and long road of "career." Because they are neither willing to numb their sensitive and intelligent brains, close their mouths that speak out for justice, and play the role of a "little bird" to be pitied; nor are they willing to sit idly by while "their husbands struggle on the lifeline" and silently follow "living below the standard." They prefer to struggle on the lifeline themselves; they would rather brave the wind and frost, shed blood and tears, and work hard, so that the sparks of joy, sorrow, success, and failure can burst out in their own life journey. Make a contribution to the entire human race.</p>
<p>Because of the above two layers of "external constraint and internal strength" reasons, many women are divorced from "marriage" and become "old maids."</p>
<p>Therefore, "old maids" cannot "play at will" or "sleep comfortably"; on the contrary, the difficulties they encounter are more complicated than those of married women. Because of the unreasonableness of the social system, women's occupations are scarce and inferior, and the treatment is harsh. "Old maids" must have great courage and a spirit of enduring hardship in order to survive.</p>
<p>Whenever there are "good days in spring and autumn" and "flowers blooming in the morning and the moon shining in the evening," people often cast pity and sympathy on "old maids," but they are unmoved, because they also have the comfort of husbands and children: comrades and achievements in their careers.</p>
<p>If you are a woman who is unwilling or unable to marry, quickly wipe off your makeup, take off your high heels, recognize the society, the country, and the world, and do "things" diligently and earnestly. In this way, ten years later, it will not be a group of "old maids" who "write sad songs with tears."</p>
<p>Be careful, this "road to career" is very rugged! Don't be afraid, there are bright moons and shining stars in the sky!</p>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>This article of mine does not advocate celibacy, which violates natural and social principles. However, it is undeniable that there are "old maids" who settle down. Looking at themselves, they are often flawless, but they are forced by bad social customs and concepts, such as being old, having unattractive appearances, and lacking abundant makeup, which are all part of the reasons. There is also a major reason: a stubborn personality, unwilling to be attached to be a "little bird" or a "sow." If she wants to be comfortable and enjoy herself, she should be smart enough to tend towards the "path of marriage," which is flatter and warmer than the "path of career." We should extend our deep sympathy to "old maids" and suggest a way out for them.</p>
<p>However, more actively, we should correct society's inaccurate evaluation of women and try to create a new position for married women, neither as a "little bird" nor as a "sow." How about " "?" so that this group of "old maids" can marry out. Mr. Editor, please reveal how? With kind regards, Liu Xian</p>
<h3>The People in Occupied France</h3>
<p>— Jun Yi</p>
<p>The people of Annam, Korea, and India have all tasted enough of the bitterness of being slaves in a conquered nation. However, the people in the occupied areas of France today, nominally appear to still be citizens of a complete nation, but in reality, they are not much different from those of a conquered people. Not only do they suffer considerable mental anguish, but they also endure very cruel material abuse. Throughout the occupied areas, one cannot find a well-nourished and mentally happy person. Their faces are filled with fear, timidity, and a weak, vacant look. Truly, their lives are gradually approaching hell. If you don't believe me, listen to what I have to say:</p>
<p>The first problem is the lack of daily necessities. Butter, meat, fat, and the like are limited to about one pound per person per week. All that is available are some vegetables that have lost their freshness, hard, dried-up yellow bread, and sweet potatoes. Not to mention anything else, even soy sauce is restricted, and it tastes like salt water because it is diluted with three-tenths of dye.</p>
<p>As for clothing, after this war, many families have had nineteen out of ten items destroyed by artillery fire. Now, wanting to add one or two pieces of clothing is truly harder than hard. One must register with the control bureau (this bureau is specifically responsible for the control and distribution of the clothing and daily necessities of the French people.) set up by the Nazis in every city a month in advance. By the time they approve and give you a purchase permit, the season may have already changed. (Clothing stores cannot sell anything to you without this permit.)</p>
<p>They cannot get accurate and reliable news from the newspapers. The newspapers either report that the German army has occupied such and such place, or they publish deceptive news about German trains carrying dozens of cars of food to help the French people. A few people who secretly keep radios are inevitably sent to the guillotine within twenty-four hours if they are overheard by the secret police. However, despite the severity of the punishment, there are still quite a few people taking this great risk.</p>
<p>The most distressing thing is the detestable German mobile teams. In the middle of the night, they force open the doors and search your house everywhere, making a complete mess before staggering away. Sometimes, when they see a beautiful girl, they force her to kiss them. These things happen at least once or twice a week, but no one dares to resist. Once, a young woman was stabbed through the throat with a knife for saying something unpleasant.</p>
<p>Living in the occupied areas, one cannot move around casually without a transfer permit issued by the government. Train stations are surrounded by detectives checking passengers. Therefore, they are almost sentenced to life imprisonment, living such a cruel life. How can those French people, who have always been accustomed to enjoying themselves, have any spirit left?</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Prisoners' Hobbies</h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>Dusk falls over a prison on the Pacific coast; then comes the night, all is silent. Suddenly, a melodious trumpet sound rises, over and over again. Gradually, people join in from all directions, and finally, it becomes a grand ensemble of hundreds of people. They play old, familiar songs; with this moving music, all one thousand inmates in the prison get a pleasant rest. They have labored all day in the prison workshops and workrooms. The first person to take up playing the trumpet as a hobby was a prisoner named Sha Kunting.</p>
<p>In a Michigan prison, an inmate uses his free time every night to make violins. His only tools are a knife and a set of sharpeners. After eight months, he finally succeeds. The finished violin is extremely exquisite, not only excellent in craftsmanship but also has a good tone.</p>
<p>In a Wisconsin prison, a group of workers gathers on the farm every Sunday to cut beautiful, colored pieces of wood into diamond shapes, star shapes, crescent shapes, and other various shapes. They use these small pieces to make various boxes. One box requires 13,000 small pieces of wood. This craftsmanship is truly superb. And their only tools are knives and sandpaper.</p>
<p>A few simple tools plus patience can make many things. They also carve many animals and human figures. Each craft is a way for prisoners to relieve loneliness and make use of time.</p>
<p>There is also a prisoner sentenced to seven years who wrote his past experiences into a novel—three novels and many short stories.</p>
<p>These facts are very worthy of our reflection because we seem to rarely pay attention to how to cultivate a hobby. People who are forced by life work all day long, and wealthy people spend their time in sensual pleasures; but no one cares about hobbies that are truly beneficial to body and mind. But from now on, everyone should try as much as possible to cultivate a hobby.</p>

<h3>Self-Opening Parachute</h3>
<p>— Yong Yun</p>
<p>One of the most difficult parts of learning to parachute is pulling the cord to open the parachute at the appropriate time. However, recently, aerial firefighters in the northwestern United States forest area and the United States Army Parachute Team have invented a self-opening parachute. It has a strong, long rope attached to the aircraft. When the paratrooper jumps down to the appropriate time, this long rope can pull the parachute open, and then the paratrooper descends leisurely.</p>

<p>Qiuhaitang stood under a street lamp, staring blankly at the sparse figures on the road for a long time.</p>
<p>"This, Mr. Qian, I don't want to!" He replied in a very calm voice after listening to what Qian Ruomo had said. "To serve those rich masters is simply impossible for me. It's better to hang around in the theater."</p>
<p>"Since you are willing to endure some grievances, then you can only hang around for a while!"</p>
<p>Qian Ruomo then moved his feet first and walked across the street; Qiuhaitang silently followed behind him.</p>
<p>"However, I'm always afraid your body won't be able to take it."</p>
<p>"The first few days might be particularly hard, but I'll get used to it slowly!" For Qiuhaitang, today's events are like a scene of "finding no road at the end of the mountain, then a village appearing amidst the willows and flowers." Therefore, he himself felt very satisfied and had absolutely no intention of being picky.</p>
<p>Hearing him say this, Qian Ruomo could only smile without saying a word. (255)</p>

<h3>Tyrone Power's Marital Crisis</h3>
<p>— Pei Lin</p>
<p>The name Tyrone Power seems to have been deeply engraved in the hearts of general movie fans. This romantic young man, after filming "Suez," married French actress Annabella, who played a supporting role in the film, in a blitzkrieg-like manner. At that time, the general public worried about his future. But facts speak louder than words. Not only did it not affect his future, but after marriage, he happily told his friends about his and Annabella's happy union. Recently, it was rumored that they were hoping to have a son, which is indeed something to be congratulated on!</p>
<p>However, as the saying goes, "The moon wanes after it is full." According to recent news from Hollywood, Tyrone Power and Annabella had a rift due to differences of opinion, and rumors spread that they were going to go through divorce proceedings. In Hollywood, men and women treat the word "marriage" as a child's play, with the idea of "marrying today and divorcing tomorrow." Annabella had already been married once and had a daughter. Her marriage to Tyrone was a second marriage. If they really divorce, then Hollywood will have one more divorce case. We hope this is just a "rumor" and wish them to reconcile so that both parties can avoid suffering unexpected pain.</p>

<p>Wu Shui intends to shoot a war film in Hong Kong. The leading actors who have been invited include Hu Die, Gao Zhanfei, Zhang Yi, and others. It is said that Jin Yan is also being courted.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Guolian is preparing to continue filming Ba Jin's "Spring" and "Autumn."</p>
<p>Because Da Shanghai has a backlog of new films, "Family" has been postponed to Christmas Day. The previously scheduled premiere of "Princess Iron Fan" has been moved to Shanghai Guang and Xinguang theaters for simultaneous screenings.</p>
<p>Han Langen's self-written, self-directed, and self-acted comedy "Congratulations on Getting Rich" is scheduled to be completed this year and can be released during the Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>After being retained by the Yihua authorities, Li Qinian agreed to return to Hong Kong after the filming of "Thief Beauty."</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's new work after returning to Shanghai will be "Private Love," written by Zhou Yibai, which Guolian has selected.</p>

<h3>Sketches of Pear Garden Figures</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi wrote the biographies　Shen Lingzhi's department　Zhang Yizhang's illustrations</p>
<p>(Nine) Hou Yulan</p>
<p>Hou Yulan is the number one red role among today's Kun Ling with a famous brand. Although she is listed as the second brand, the roles she gets are perhaps more lucrative than those of the lead actress. Now she has created a significant force in Peiping, and her momentum is very strong! Compared to ordinary Kun Dan with a tacked-on reputation, her sharpness is far superior, which can also be considered a miracle. Yulan's singing and recitation are deliberately modeled after Yanqiu, and there are many similarities. Moreover, she has learned it naturally, without any traces of artificiality, which makes people feel uncomfortable. It is also enough to show her diligence. Her demeanor on stage is even better, showing a dignified and elegant bearing. Her situation is the same as that of Zhang Junqiu among the male actors. Both are Qing Yi who cannot be the lead actress, but Junqiu's "stage presence" does not seem as free and easy as hers. Her success is definitely not accidental, and it is worthy of pride for a second-brand Kun Ling to reach this point.</p>

<p>Then he smiled coldly at Zhang Cangqiu and said, "Commander Zhang, you only know one thing but not the other. I have thought over and over again about this decision to ask the Qing for help. If you worry that the bandits have already broken through and the Qing soldiers will not retreat, that is an overestimation. Although we use the land outside the pass, we can [?] the Qing people's hope. If it doesn't work out, we can gather our troops and fight the Qing soldiers. In short, this is a temporary expedient, and there is no need to worry too much. The letter asking for help has been sent, and the Qing soldiers have already come out. This is not a child's play, how can it be reversed? You don't need to interfere too much, just listen to my orders." Xu Jing was about to open his mouth to speak, but Wu Sangui had already flicked his sleeves and stood up, retreating behind the screen. Seeing Sangui's attitude like this, Zhang Cangqiu and the other three had no choice but to retreat. Returning to their own place, Zhang Cangqiu looked around and, seeing no one, said hatefully to the three: "Wu Sangui has only a false reputation. If this fellow continues like this, he will definitely suffer at the hands of the Qing soldiers, giving them a good opportunity. According to my heart, I wish I could kill that fellow first, and then raise troops to suppress the bandits." Xu Jing said, "Although Sangui is attached to foreigners, his rebellious actions have not yet been revealed. If we kill him, we will only disrupt the morale of the army, which will not help the matter. On the contrary, people will say that we are committing insubordination and rebellion, and have other ambitions." Liu [?]ying said, "The original intention of our coming here to seek refuge with Wu Sangui was because he was a hero, so we were willing to follow him. Now that he has done such an unwise thing, which will cause harm to the country in the future, we all disagree. Since the world is so big and there are so many heroes, good birds choose trees to perch on, and virtuous ministers choose masters to serve. Why don't we leave here happily and go somewhere else?
