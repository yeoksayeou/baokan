<h3>湘北戰局的剖析</h3>
<p>基輔失陷之後，冬寒已漸次籠蓋着北歐的原野，雖然連日蘇德兩軍鏖戰仍烈，蘇軍在中路的反攻且獲得重大進展。但一般見解，都認爲戰事漸成消耗性質，一時雙方都未必能有決定性的淮退。而日本正在慘烈進行的湘北戰事，則方吸引着中外人士則重大關切，湘北與長沙固然不足與列甯城克里米亞相比擬，但此一戰役的進退得失，則也絕不僅是中日雙方之間的問題。</p>
<p>三數日間，長沙市的得失，幾乎形成迷離惝恍的一個謎、敵對雙方所發的戰報，自然不能盡同，但也絕少像此次關於長沙消息之絕對相反，且連續亘三數日之久。長沙是湖南的省會，不過却不是那一戰區的重心，長沙得失爲一事，湘北戰役的得失又爲一事，長沙的安全固然不能確保湘北戰局的無虞，反之，長沙即不幸失陷也絕非戰事的失敗，從純軍事觀點看來，這並不是一個十分値得爭論的問題。但如果細按連日日方所發攻陷長沙的捷報，則立可發現其間存有若干無法掩飾的漏洞。據該項戰報：日軍在九月二十七夜間已估有長沙全部，但迄今已歷四日，其所披露的只有在長沙外圍作戰的經過與從飛機上拍照的市區撮影，關於長沙被「佔領」後的具體情形却一無陳述，此其一。直到昨晨五時許，中國方面還不斷接得長沙方面的來電，關於當地種種情况叙述綦詳，而據說進佔長沙已歷四日的日方，則絕少有拍自長沙的電訉，報告種種詳情，此其二。被邀前往長沙視察的外記者一行，除却在市空俯瞰而外，絕未親履該土，其在日方招待之下所拍來的電訉，對於日軍如何佔領該城的情形亦復含混其詞，鮮所說明，此其三。更何况在株州的迅速「完成其目標而退去」，在長沙市上做三百呎低空飛行而竟不見懸有日旗，又都是極重大的疑竇。長沙的最後安危固猶有待於此後　况的開展，但日方於四日前已「完全佔領長沙」的戰報則絕不足以使人置信。</p>
<p>此次日方所以如此輕率的發爲戰報，適足見其盼望勝利心情的急切，其在湘北之所以一味冒險躁進，也正是這一心情支配的結果。其實就兩週來戰役演進經過和目前戰况觀察，日軍處境實毫無可以樂觀的理由。照日方原定戰略。本準備三路並進，左翼沿武長公路南下，右翼以艦艇在營田蘆林潭載兵上陸，沿湘水進犯，中路則突破新牆汨羅，以窺伺長沙正面。這一佈置，在規模上已遠較前秋之役爲簡陋、那次另有一路日軍由九嶺以西沿武長公路窺平江，在贛西方面則分由武寧奉新等地西侵銅鼓修水以拊湘北華軍之背，假如那次日軍計畫全部得逞，則湘北形勢實較目今情况更加危險。自九月十八日日軍在新牆正面發動之後，廿一日即被阻於汨水南岸歸義等地，中路方面自此即迄無進展，旋又沿汨水東進由捂口甕江一帶折入由平江到長沙的公路，以直綫形的進犯直薄長沙近郊。至於洞庭水路方面，日軍雖曾在營田蘆林潭上陸，但昨日電訉所傳，已由華軍克復，較前秋之一度攻陷湘陰者且有遜色，以是乃未能與其左翼深入的部隊呼應滙合，而公路方面的日軍則完全陷於孤軍深入的形勢。以五萬日軍來犯之猛之其竟獲逼近長沙外圍甚至城郊原無足異，那種一望平坦的地帶絕不是適於華軍堵截決戰的地區；但是日軍入侵越深，距離後方越遠，其前後方的接濟交通都越感困難，允其是除却日軍進路的一條路綫而外，湘北全面地區始終都在華軍確保之中，這一部分入侵日軍處境的危險是不言可喻的。九月廿八日華軍在日軍後方反攻，前後克復長樂街浯口新市歸義以及洞庭湖口的蘆林潭，至此華軍已控制着從平江釗營田的汨羅沿岸全綫，日軍後方的給養綫已不難遭受切斷。在長沙附近的數萬日衆，日來方在竭力挣扎突擊之中，但照目前兩軍形勢看來，那不只不足以有爲，反而行將陷於華軍包圍肅淸之中。昨天在漢口的華中日軍司令阿南已經重彈「日軍目的不在土地」的舊調、預料距其揭櫫「業於完成任務後退去」之期或己不在遠，至於其是吾能夠獲得「安然退去」，則要看此後華軍作戰成果如何。</p>
<p>此次日方突然進犯湘北，適如前面所指示，是急切盼望獲得一個重大勝利，俾利用之以解除其內外處境之艱困。其特別選取湘北作爲目標者，一則因爲在該地已幾經作戰，地形軍情均極熟悉，再則由岳州進窺長沙，距離旣近，復有鐵路公路水路三方面的交通便利，而當地地勢一望平坦，亦實利於日而不利於華。但是假如日軍一戰而勝，那只是因避重就輕而得到的收穫，並不足以表示日軍實力的堅强；倘其戰而不勝、則適足益顯日軍的頹勢並史增加其內外形勢的不利，這也就是其在此次會戰中一再增援以期一逞的原因。湘北日軍的攻勢，到現在業已漸同弩末了，以是此後三數日內的戰報實具有重大的決定意義，華軍在長期養精蓄銳之餘且新得友邦精神物質雙方的助力，相信其決不會使愛好正義人士感到失望的。</p>

<h3>紗花　南洋訂購之電訉雪片飛來　雙馬新價層出不窮　空頭祗得出高價掉期過夜</h3>
<p>上日漲後轉下之紗市、昨則開平盤後、又復轉趨上升、且漲風益　、新高峰層出不窮、此因海外交易賡續而不斷、南洋購訂之電訊雪片飛來、以致雙馬廠單愈抽愈緊、因之空頭雖奮鬪不懈、然籌碼殊感缺乏、近日造成收盤以前、形勢頗虛、但收盤以後、欲掀反硬、突然挺上、可想棧單之稀少也、不敷周轉、那末空頭無法、祗得出高價而覓掉期過夜、就此一點、市面難以鬆落、不過拋空者依然踴躍、認爲局勢孔生變化即可獲利矣、至於港幫交易、較爲淸靜、然又有人說、市上現貨乾枯、廠方對於工作减縮、出數甚弱、二十支雙馬高價位一千八百五十五元、低價爲一千八百二十四元、午後初開甚堅、以上午收盤、塲外忽升七八元、仍爲一千八百四十八元、然浮空仍活動、疲至一千八百四十三元、但棧單殊緊、又升至一千八百五十二元、迨至將近收盤、稍有流言、投機商某某忽出四五千包之鉅、跌至一千八百四十元、然被大戶掃數吃去、收盤價爲一千八百四十二元、收盤以後空方棧單額子不夠、掉期價　昂、每件至七八敎、尙外買者紛爭、又漲至一千八百四十七八元云、今日有棉紗三百三十件運　　、又一千五百三十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開氣勢和平、首盤價爲一千八百三十二元、少頃升至一千八百三十五元、然檯面平常、又鬆至一千八百二十四元、繼後聞取引所紗布市况步拍步升、於是人心提起、一般搶空頭帽子之流、鑒於　頭不利、紛起抵補、市盤得此推動、逐漸上升至一千八百五十五元、但某大戶之多頭見血撈現、又鬆至一千八百四十一元、但收盤以後、大眾互相爭購、漲至一千八百四十七八元、查半日間成交統計一萬五千零二十包、茲將各幫　買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>南洋　　　二〇　同行　一五、〇〇〇</p>
<p>統計　一五、〇二〇</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨、以廠單復報俏利、解禁與放行謠傳囂塵、終日盤趨高翔、尤以本月份軋空態度、似呈實現之象、然遠期十二月新空尙稱踴躍、市塲人氣不復如客昨之熱烈、究以廠單稍趨堅平之故也、當晨初開盤十月份爲一七二〇元、比昨巳漲十元〇五角、頭盤拍落、各月相將好起五六元左右、十月一七一六元五角、十一角份一七一五元、十二月一七五〇元、爲頭盤收價、二盤十月份繼續做堅、抬至一七二〇元五角、拍落十一月遂見　俏、新買一　而上、爲一七二四元、十二月緊度仍勁、創一七六一元、三盤市氣　抬、近期十月爲一七三〇元五角、十一月一七三三元爲前市收價、十二月則反挫落三元、計一七五八元收價、下午兩盤人心均極穩、欲疲不能、欲漲無力、幾經錯綜、犬致計三五元上落、十月份以一七三二元開價、一七二九院收價、十一月一七三五元開盤、一七三二元開價、一七三二元五角收價、十二月一七六〇元開價、一七五八元五角收價、全日最高價十月份爲一七三四元、十一月爲一七三五元、十二月爲一七四四元、前後兩市總成交一萬五千餘包、內以十月十二月爲獨旺盛、較前日十月漲十九元五角、十一月漲二十二元、十二月漲十二元、茲列表於後、</p>

<h3>棉價依然勁俏</h3>
<p>現棉情況交易雖不旺、但行情緊俏如恒、每天有升無降、原因爲市上存底單薄、來源渺茫、尤其粗絨棉漲風益劇、二十三支原料美種彭家浦價迫近六百元矣、火機棉價爲三百四十五元、三百包棧交云、</p>
<p>巴西棉　一二五件　七一〇·〇甲新二廠</p>
<p>美種彭加坡　二〇〇件　五九三·五號家</p>

<p>又　一〇〇件　三四五·〇　又</p>
<p>火機花　三〇〇　三四五·〇　又</p>
<p>紐約棉市、因有歐洲政治消息　邱吉　濱詞利於多頸、及華兩街股票堅昂而漲、同業及投機者買進之活　　同時空頭低補亦　興奮、故結果收盤價格、較之上日約漲十四五磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市、昨日爲銀行例假、棉市循列休業、至於預測今日開盤市况、因棉　見漲而看高一羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食　新米不絕而來　米仍把持</h3>
<p>昨養米初疲繼漲、市面又呈蓬勃之興隆氣象、初因承前晚疲風、雖有客幫　消、而市面終難回好、且以倉米五萬八千包巳經正式公布十日後以一百十元之低價公賣、批價亦减爲一百三十三元七角半、且有二千噸公賣米正在接洽中、故市價半疲無神、銀行棧小絞乃一百十五元之正式價售開、外棧小至一百十四元、但價小後卽位客囤趁平暢收、尤以投機團買馬旺、而皮球交易尤爲活潑、市乃立卽轉疲爲俏、且聞電洽之小絞價爲一百三十六元一角七分六能否復實尙難預測、因此市價立隨人心上展、小綾　又到一百十八元半下午略平、收市回落半元、英華司現貨一百三十九院至一百四十二元七角、次一百三十六元半、路一百四十五元半、統比前市較大　外及二三元不一、成交現米二萬五千包、英華司一千噸、</p>
<p>厚薄新破兩　國米、昨續承定不一之局、南港新　早破猶以到稀銷　頗俏、價繼漲三四元、開百五十元、次至百四十七元、無錫厚破、則以貨品較宿、不過平平、仍售百五十元、新　到貨雖較前略遜、然去路依然不爽、故價續貶开　、開崑山新　特自百五十元、次至百四十七、崑山新杜尖昨日巳上市矣、惟爲數尙寥、共祗三十來但、貨質尙佳、以是一朝時新銷塲頗熱、售開百二十七元、百二十六元半、</p>
<p>糯米初則平平、後隨洋米帶緊、零躉兩胃、均頗活絡、所以行情較前挺秀、開香港特元百四十二元、普通百四十元、百三十八元、黃色次元百三十六元、糯米百三十一元、百三十元、</p>
<h3>囤粉不衰　粉價何由得落</h3>
<p>洋麵粉又有到埠、太古公司漢陽輪昨晨抵滬、由香港裝來麵粉九千一百六十一包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、</p>
<p>昨洋粉早市開價、即被本客行囤趁低爭辦、兼以洋米回振與執貨者之堅持、晨間市氣巳呈緊張狀態、故開價立即漲二三角、砲台開價爲三十五元零五分、金龍西棧三十三元零五分、旋以買氣不衰、且轉口需要尙濃、而投機納胃更食、雖有獲利多頭回出、而價格終見續砌、砲台漲至三十五元三角、西棧金龍至三十三元六角、漲達三十三元九角、五燕與紅日當天前晚抑低三四角而乏受主、昨均以三十四元六角售開、惟午後一度盤旋後、晚收略見回平、砲台收市三十五元一角半、西棧金龍三十三元一角半、仍比前晚回好三四角、小麥存到兩枯、棧貨仍喊五十元、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆油二千件來滬　油價仍見上騰</h3>
<p>油儈外米蟲紗幫拉抬食油投機買風昨又轉　、藍以米漲紗昂、米紗兩幫市儈遽爾不問到銷情形、再展抬價作風、故菜油及棉子油期貨悉被拉升四五元、生豆油等亦同見帶緊、統市售開靑島生油一百餘桶、大有廠菜油近千担、又淸油期貨一萬多担、日華廠菜油期貨一千餘桶、（價詳市價欄）</p>
<p>又豆油昨由天津運來二千件、今日有豆餅二百五十張、運往、</p>
<h3>糖市　砂糖續有來滬　糖價無端重漲</h3>
<p>昨糖市復緊、遂見回振三元至數角不一、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白九月十六日入口一百四十八元七角至九元半、升七角、八月份入口一百四十八元至八元八角、升三角、七月份入口一百四十七元六角、升六角、六月份入口一百四十六元八角、升八角、荷赤無甚上落、爲一百三十三元半、香港粗白初爲一百三十八元、旋升至四十元至四十元零半、升二元半、太古車白Ｂ　一百六十三元、升一元、ＨＸ　一百四十四元、升三元、Ｈ　車赤一百二十六元、比（九·二十七、）升七元半、期貨二四粗白雙十節交割一百四十五元·六元六角至八角、一度小升四十三元四角、後仍升至一百四十六元八角、升一元七角、二十日交割一百四十七元二角至九元四角及八角、中途回至七元二角、收盤八元八角、升一元九角、</p>
<p>砂糖繼續來滬、太古公司漢陽輪昨晨到埠、除由香港運來大批麵粉外、又裝來食糖四千三百包、停法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸</p>
<h3>疋頭　南洋幫染廠搜羅　現貨東細斜　售盤猛升二元外</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢堅挺、人心向昂、惟南洋幫港幫實銷生意、以船隻缺乏、進意稍淡、本街因屆節邊、添辦亦稀、而以同業及囤戶進出最繁、售盤粗細布斜紋每　漲五角至七角半、漂染布漲五角左右、</p>
<p>東布　現貨細斜提漲最速藍南洋幫及染廠商一再搜辦、貨根枯竭、每　猛升二元至二元五角哦之鉅</p>

<h3>外商謀節省燃料　倡導連續辦公制</h3>
<p>午餐及休息時間均取消　職員往返車資亦可節減</p>
<p>警務方面及華方銀行尚難採用</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本市若干商家之辦事時間、已實行一班辦法、即每日連續辦公數小時、取消進餐之休息時間、而提早公畢是、聞美商會亦贊成上海美商號行此辦法、俾在今冬節省本市燃料之存底、</p>
<p>若干美商　已經實行</p>
<p>美商會秘書霍思、已函促各會員在其辦公處即日實行一班辦法、函中略稱、觀於本市今冬殊有保存煤斤存底之必要、故實行一班辦法、頗爲重要、若干美商家業已實行此法、其所定辦公時間、一般皆爲晨八時至午後一時、惟其他商家可仿此自擇適宜之時間、以求同樣之撙節效果、美商會董事會於數日前會議時、提出建議、考慮此事、獲得全體贊成云、</p>
<p>警務方面　勢難採納</p>
<p>據工部局發言人答覆記者稱、該局董事會並未討論此事、改變辦公時間或可使商家稍减其燃料之支出、惟該局因須維持警務與消防等必要服務、勢難採取此舉云、聞上海現有美孚油公司與頣中烟草公司等上　家大商行、已開始一班工作之辦法、預料其他美商行、經商會肆議後、亦將隨之改變現行辦公時間、</p>
<p>華方銀行　料將拒絕</p>
<p>但華方銀行料將拒絕此　、而外商銀行與經紀人或將因之續照通常冬李時間辦公、據各方面　見、辦公時間改爲一班辦法之　果、將使今冬之燃料消耗大　、而商行職員亦蒙其利、藍平日　返兩趟者、因此祇須往返一次、可省下半數車咨也、</p>
<p>英國商會　今H集議</p>
<p>英國商會定今日（二日）下午、召染會議、討論一班辦公鐘點、以　省燃料、並使職員撙節車資之建議、此項建議、如經決定、將由該商會會長馬歇爾　告本埠各英國商行採用、　雖不能斷定何種辦公鐘點　適用於一般職“但深信此項建議、將受歡迎美國商行已實行一班辦公制其所採用鐘點大概自晨八時至下午一時、美國商會副會長倪古爾稱，此項鐘點對於若干公司　關、或不適用、但不妨採用其他鐘點、祇須合於節約原則、</p>
<h3>全市各界準備　熱烈慶祝雙十節　懸旗休假推進節約救難運動</h3>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>醫學</p>
<h3>輸血新法</h3>
<p>— 皆宜</p>
<p>自從輸血法發明後，無數受意外創傷而流血過多的人們，因是而得救；無數垂死的貧血病人，也因是而得繼續復活；這是已往醫學界偉大貢獻之一。</p>
<p>可是根據數十年來許多醫家臨床實騐的結果，覺得輸血法的應用還不能普遍化。考其原因，大概有二：第一因爲血的來源，是從另外一個人身上得來，在現今什麽多要錢的世界，血的價値是相當地貴（差不多）100c.c.要二十元左右）；有不少貧苦病人，常因無錢購血，而竟不治。第二就是時間的限制：往往有急症病的病人需要血時，在一定的時間內，找一個適合輸血的人，頗爲不易；雖然近來已有輸血公司等組織，來補救這第二個缺點，可是在窮鄉僻壤交通不便的地方，這仍舊是一個嚴重的問題。爲了免除上述兩種不便，許多醫家日日在設法改進中。到了最近，震且大學醫學院敎授徐寳彝博士和醫學院的學生們已得到一個適當而合理的辦法，這就是我要談的輸血新法。</p>
<p>這個方法，在手術上和靜脈注射完全樣；至於血的來源，並不是由另外一個人身上得來，而是從剛生產後胎婦和嬰孩結連的臍帶中取出，這無疑是，中國醫學界上的新發現。</p>
<p>原來胎兒在母體的胞衣內時，其營養全由母體血液供給經過臍帶而始得到。到嬰兒產出後，近嬰孩頭的臍帶中血液，漸漸凝結，而近胞衣一頭的血液，也開始凝集，此時胞衣尙未落下，臍帶中尙有一部份血液存在，就在此時，用藥水洗淸臍帶的外圍，再用刀在臍帶中開一小口，使本凝結的血液，流於一小瓶中。然後將瓶中的血液，過濾一次，再化騐其是吾含有細菌。經化騐後，如血液中沒有細菌，再檢驗此血液究屬何型（Groupesanguin）然後把相同型的血液置放一起，以供應用。</p>
<p>血液如此收集到的，加人幾種化學劑，即可不致立即凝結，此化學劑之成分如下：</p>
<p>Serum　Physiologigu　e　sale．　1000c．c．</p>
<p>Citrate　de　soude105g．</p>
<p>Glucose　0.5cg．</p>
<p>Sulganilamide　1，5g．</p>
<p>如再將此血液放在冰箱內，可以保存至十五日之久（這是目前的話，將來日期也許還可延長些。）等到病人需要輸血時，將與病人同型的血液注射在靜脈血管中即可，所以手術並不見得麻煩；可是前面談到的兩個困難，是解決了。這個收集血液的詳細方法，在不久出版的震旦醫刊上發表，以爲各醫家之參考。</p>
<p>到現在止，經過徐醫生注射此種血液而得救的病人，已有數十人，病人輸入血後，經過情形極好，毫無反應。所以這個方法在不久的將來，爲各醫家所採用，是毫無疑問的。</p>
<p>最近徐醫師正率領着震旦醫學院的學生，在硏究臍帶中血液和母體及嬰孩血液關係，等到這個問題解決時，那麼母子或父子不同型血液分佈的情形，就可以有進一步的了解了。</p>
<p>史話</p>
<h3>獬豸</h3>
<p>— 柷敔</p>
<p>（艾子新解之六）</p>
<p>我國有許多傳說中的怪物，如搏訑，如羊，九尾，四耳，目在背；窫窳，如馬，赤身人面，馬足；鳧徯，如雄雞，人面；酸與，如蛇，四翼，六目，三足、鶼鴰，一身九首，九尾，逆毛……它們如果還活着，我們恐怕都要怕得小敢出去了。本文所述的獬豸是其中之一。</p>
<p>獬豸同一種叫做麒麟的怪物形體上相似，只是頭上有一隻堅而銳的角。看過古戲的人曉得，衙門牆上畫的，官員衣中心綉的那隻動物，便是懈豸。這有什麼出典？聽下去－－</p>
<p>齊宣王有一天問艾子說：「我們不是常常聽到懈豸這種奇獸的嗎？它到底是個什麼東西啊？」</p>
<p>艾子以爲齊王別有用意，就呑呑吐吐地說：「臣……不知道。」</p>
<p>「哎喲，」齊王說，「我不過問問吧了！艾卿，你是聰明而博學的人，一定知道的。唔，現在還有懈豸嗎？」</p>
<p>艾子一見齊王的面容如常，乃答曰：「懈豸在堯時有過，此刻已給人殺光了。臣在古書中讀到：大堯的朝廷中必養着一匹獬豸，此物大奇，羣臣中有心惡的，心貪的，心黑的，它都知道，就用它頭上的獨角把那人撞死，當廷吃下他，絲毫無爽。」</p>
<p>「那麼它是公平之神子？可惜給人殺光了！」齊王點頭說。</p>
<p>「是呀！要是現在養一隻獬豸，它也不像堯時那樣整天餓着肚子了，它大槪飽得連芻料也不要大王去買了。」艾子笑，齊王也笑。</p>
<p>獬豸，尊貴的懈豸，你幾時復活呢？</p>

<h3>起身電報</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>不多幾時前，美國西聯電報局曾開辦了一種新奇的業務－起身電報。對於喜歡在早晨睡晚覺的人們，西聯電報局終於想出了這個辦法來，其手續是規定一個時間，叫報差在淸晨遞來電報一通。晏起的朋友在甜蜜的睡鄕中聽說有電報來了，他如果不曾先知道這椿妙計的話，當會立刻醒來。即使後來他曉得了個中秘密時，電報局方面亦已想到一個計策。局方會每隔十五分鐘差人送來「起身電報」，如此接連不斷的，到底會使那些「睡不醒」的人們惱得不高興再往床上鑽。</p>
<p>一般說來，「起身電報」的用意，的確很好。何况辦法又那麼簡便。在這裏，我謹以十二萬分的至誠希望：這種業務不久會擴展到中國，尤其是上海等幾個大都市來，叫那般「不願意早起」的朋友，也能够欣賞欣賞淸晨的美景，與領悟一下時間的寳貴。</p>
<h3>貧窮與慚愧</h3>
<p>— 一嗚</p>
<p>貧窮的人，不應該爲了貧窮而慚愧。因爲貧窮並不是惡事。</p>
<p>假使一個人做了惡事，或僅是微惡的事，他的心就覺得不安；對不住人，更對不住己。純潔的心上，便感到有汚點存在。他才應該慚愧呢。</p>
<p>所以，假使一個人，沒做惡事，單是爲了貧窮而慚愧，是無意義的，是不正確的。爲非作惡才値得感到慚愧啦。</p>

<p>老孟說到這裏，差一些就把秋海棠返得笑出來。</p>

<h3>Total Victory in Northern Hunan by Elite Troops: 50,000 Japanese Soldiers Encircled; Ying Tian, Following Lei Lu Lin Tan, Also Recovered by China; Japanese Plainclothes Squads Completely Eliminated in Suburbs of Changsha</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Battle reports from the front lines in Hunan Province indicate that the battle situation in Changsha has largely stabilized. The Chinese army's counteroffensive is making significant progress. According to the latest Chinese sources, approximately 50,000 Japanese soldiers are currently encircled by Chinese forces in the northeastern mountains of Changsha, specifically in the areas of Chunhua Mountain, Yong'an City, and Huanghua City. These locations are situated between the Lao Dao River and the Liuyang River, that is, between Changsha and Liuyang. Liuyang River is a key city east of Changsha. To cut off the Japanese army's retreat, the Chinese army has completely occupied all major crossing points of the Miluo River behind the Japanese lines, extending from the eastern shores of Dongting Lake to Pingxiang on the main highway. In recent days, the Japanese army has desperately attempted to break through the Chinese encirclement, frequently deploying paratroopers behind Chinese lines, but these efforts have been thwarted by the Chinese army. There are now growing signs of a Japanese retreat. The Japanese troops who landed near Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan have suffered heavy casualties after a fierce Chinese offensive and have re-embarked on their warships as of yesterday. It is reported that the Chinese Air Force has been actively cooperating with the ground forces by bombing Japanese positions near Huanghua City, northeast of Changsha, for several consecutive days. Yesterday, 23 Japanese aircraft bombed Hengyang, a key city in southern Hunan. Meanwhile, the Japanese forces advancing north from Guangzhou have been halted. According to Chinese sources, the Japanese column advancing along the North River, intending to support the Japanese column advancing north along the Yuehan Railway, has moved eastward towards the railway. Another Japanese column advancing from Huaxian on the east side of the railway has been stopped by the Chinese army. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to telephone reports from Changsha, the Chinese army is tightening its encirclement of the 50,000 Japanese soldiers trapped. This morning, the Chinese army achieved a major victory northeast of the city, launching an offensive between Jinjing and Chunhua Mountain. It is claimed that 2,000 Japanese soldiers were killed and 30 tanks destroyed. Various public organizations in China are preparing to hold mass parades to celebrate the victory in Hunan. However, military authorities state that while China is gaining the upper hand and launching a final assault on the Japanese forces northeast of Changsha, celebrations should not be held until the final outcome of the battle is clear. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to reliable sources, the Chinese army's counteroffensive northeast of Changsha is yielding excellent results, with intense attacks continuing today. Solid results are expected tonight. Japanese plainclothes squads in Changsha have also been completely eliminated. According to a military expert who has commanded operations in northern Hunan and northern Jiangxi several times, the victorious conclusion of the northern Hunan campaign is now assured. After the Chinese army occupied various strongholds on both sides of the Miluo River, the Japanese army's land transportation line was cut off. Only supply lines from Dongting Lake remained. This route is not only direct, but also has a much greater shipping capacity than vehicles. Therefore, when the Chinese army launched its counteroffensive, it first focused its efforts on attacking Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan at the mouth of the Xiang River, and recaptured them in one fell swoop. As a result, the Japanese army's supplies were completely cut off, and this morning there were signs of retreat. However, the Chinese army's fierce attack is not merely to defend Changsha, but to annihilate the Japanese forces, with the expectation of wiping out the elite Japanese 3rd and 4th Divisions. The expert highly praised the commander and a certain group army commander for consistently directing operations from the front lines, considering it a major key to the victory in this decisive battle. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to front-line news from Changsha at 6:30 PM tonight, the Chinese army's counteroffensive this morning was extremely successful in the Chunhua Mountain area. Progress was also made north of the Lao Dao River, with many key points captured. Lu Lin Tan, west of the Xiang River, was also recaptured. The Japanese troops at Ying Tian, north of that location, have retreated. The plainclothes squads discovered in Changsha last night have been eliminated. According to qualified sources, the Japanese side used plainclothes squads and paratroopers this time because they believed that the Chinese army would have already prepared to retreat as the Japanese army advanced smoothly to the suburbs of Changsha. Therefore, they intended to intimidate the enemy. However, the Chinese army's city defense troops and field army fought independently, with the field army closely pursuing and the city defense troops bravely resisting any invading enemy. As a result, the Japanese side's first attempt to use plainclothes squads and paratroopers ended in failure. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: General Xue Yue, commander-in-chief of the Ninth War Area, reported from Changsha by telephone to the high command here last night that the Chinese army on the Changsha front has begun a general offensive on all strongholds. "The results are extremely satisfactory, and a decisive victory can be achieved within one or two days." He also stated that within twelve hours, the gains of the Chinese army's counteroffensive included the recapture of Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan. The above two points are where the Japanese troops landed from Dongting Lake. In addition, several strongholds in the northeastern and eastern regions of Changsha were also captured. Observers believe that if this news is true, the Japanese army's naval supply line will eventually be cut off. It was also reported that a small group of Japanese plainclothes squads re-entered Changsha, but it is believed that they will soon be surrounded by the Chinese army. The statement indicated that the high command is very confident about encircling the Japanese army. It was also stated that several hundred Japanese paratroopers landed on the main defense lines of the Chinese army in Changsha. Details are unknown. General Xue Yue also confirmed a report stating that the Japanese army has indeed begun to retreat towards Yuezhou today. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Japanese plainclothes squads that sneaked into the suburbs of Changsha have been completely eliminated by the Chinese army. Currently, both sides are fighting in the northeast area of Changsha. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military News: (1) The Japanese troops who invaded Lu Lin Tan on the 22nd were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese army in the area west of that location. After fierce fighting until the evening of the 29th, the Japanese casualties were heavy. The Chinese army then took advantage of the situation to launch an attack, capturing Lu Lin Tan by the morning of the 30th. A portion of the Japanese troops escaped north on Japanese warships, while another portion was surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese army. (2) The Japanese troops who forcibly landed at Ying Tian on the evening of the 24th were completely repelled by the Chinese army by noon on the 30th. The Japanese troops boarded their warships and fled. (3) The Japanese troops who advanced north from Xin Street were still engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the Yinzhanao area near Yiyuan on the afternoon of the 28th. (4) A portion of the Japanese troops near Qingyuan crossed the river and harassed Zhouxinwei on the 28th, and are currently engaged in battle with the Chinese army. (5) On the 28th, Japanese troops from Qianlongxiang north of Bailong invaded Shiyantang, and were met by a Chinese army, with intense fighting. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ever-Victorious General: Defending Changsha</p>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding the Japanese army's recent invasion from Yuezhou along the Yuehan Railway and the Xiang River, Japanese sources admit that they have encountered fierce resistance from the Chinese army under the command of General Xue Yue, commander of the Ninth War Area. Xue Yue is 45 years old this year and is one of the most skilled generals in the Chinese army. Two years ago, when the Japanese army first launched an attack on Changsha, they had already reached the city of Changsha. Changsha's terrain is flat, with no natural barriers to stop the Japanese army's tanks and armored vehicles. Therefore, at that time, many people expected Changsha would eventually fall. Xue Yue, who was then the administrative officer of the Ninth War Area, used his intelligence and commanded the Chinese army to launch a counteroffensive, achieving a complete victory. Changsha was defended. Xue Yue was highly praised by his superiors. The Japanese army, on the other hand, insisted that they did not intend to occupy Changsha and immediately retreated. Subsequently, Xue Yue replaced Chen Cheng as the commander of the Ninth War Area, rising to become a national hero. Xue Yue's record of repelling the Japanese army did not begin with that battle. In 1937, he participated in the famous Battle of Shanghai. After that, he led his troops in battles along the Nanxun Road and the Longhai Road, never suffering a defeat in any battle. Therefore, he is known as the "Ever-Victorious General." His most significant achievement was the Battle of Lanfeng, in which the commander of the Japanese 14th Division, Doihara, escaped the encirclement in a fighter plane. Today, the Japanese army is attacking Changsha again, and their purpose is likely to destroy Xue Yue's elite army of 400,000 men. This army is composed of the Central Army and troops from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. Xue Yue is from Guangdong, so the people of Guangdong are very pleased that Xue Yue is fighting in Hunan. Xue Yue was born in Lechang and received military education at an unknown military academy. He became known for his bravery as soon as he entered the battlefield. Among the senior Chinese generals, Xue Yue is not well known to the outside world because he is by nature dislikes propaganda and seeks to work practically. (International News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>Chinese Air Force Bombs Japanese Positions</p>
<p>A Certain Location: The Japanese army has been invading the northern Hunan area for several consecutive days. The brave Chinese Air Force, the bombing squadron, in coordination with the Chinese army units, continued to bomb the Japanese soldiers and Japanese mechanized units in northern Hunan on the 29th when the weather was clear, achieving great results. The Chinese aircraft safely returned after the mission was completed. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hengyang: Japanese aircraft attacked Hengyang in five waves today. The entire area was under air raid alert all day. Six aircraft came in the second wave, nine in the third, and six in the fourth, dropping bombs on Hengyang in batches. Only a few Japanese aircraft came to Hengyang to observe during the other waves. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ji'an: At 5:00 AM this morning, three Japanese aircraft flew from the northwest and invaded the airspace of Ji'an City for reconnaissance, strafing with machine guns. They were repelled by the Chinese air defense units. In addition, three other Japanese aircraft successively invaded western and eastern Jiangxi for reconnaissance before leaving. (30th Dispatch)</p>

(2) In the Taiyue Mountain area, fierce fighting continued between the Chinese and Japanese armies on the original battlefield from the evening of the 28th to the 29th. (3) According to a dispatch from Tongguan on the 30th, a portion of the Japanese infantry and cavalry from Yuxiang, Jinan, invaded the vicinity of Huangjialing on the 26th and are currently engaged in battle with the Chinese army. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Front Line in Northern Guangdong: The Japanese troops who attacked Huaxian County and belonged to Er Dousong (Military Field North) were severely attacked by the Chinese army and were unable to continue their advance, and are currently in a stalemate there.

The Chinese army is now taking advantage of the victory and advancing step by step. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The Japanese troops entrenched in Bao suddenly launched a force across the river to attack west this morning, forcibly landing near Fengmen in Jiang'an North.

<h3>Analysis of the Northern Hunan Campaign</h3>
<p>After the fall of Kyiv, winter has gradually covered the fields of Northern Europe. Although the fierce fighting between the Soviet and German armies continues for days, and the Soviet counteroffensive in the central sector has achieved significant progress, it is generally believed that the war is gradually becoming a war of attrition, and neither side may be able to achieve a decisive victory in the short term. Meanwhile, the intense Northern Hunan campaign being waged by Japan is attracting great attention from both Chinese and foreign observers. Northern Hunan and Changsha are certainly not comparable to Leningrad or Crimea, but the gains and losses of this campaign are by no means a problem solely between China and Japan.</p>
<p>In the span of a few days, the fate of Changsha City has become an elusive enigma. The war reports issued by the opposing sides naturally cannot be entirely the same, but rarely has there been such an absolute contradiction and continuity in news regarding Changsha lasting for several days. Changsha is the capital of Hunan Province, but it is not the center of that war zone. The gain or loss of Changsha is one matter, and the gain or loss of the Northern Hunan campaign is another. The security of Changsha cannot guarantee the safety of the Northern Hunan campaign. Conversely, the unfortunate fall of Changsha is by no means a defeat in the war. From a purely military point of view, this is not a matter worth arguing about. However, if one examines the Japanese reports of capturing Changsha in recent days, it immediately becomes apparent that there are some undeniable loopholes. According to these reports, the Japanese army had already occupied all of Changsha on the night of September 27th, but four days have passed, and the only information disclosed is the course of the fighting on the outskirts of Changsha and aerial photographs of the urban area. There is no description of the specific situation after Changsha was "occupied." This is one point. Until about 5:00 AM yesterday, the Chinese side continued to receive telegrams from Changsha detailing various situations in the area, while the Japanese side, which claimed to have occupied Changsha for four days, rarely sent reports from Changsha reporting various details. This is another point. A group of foreign reporters invited to inspect Changsha only took an aerial view of the city and never set foot on the ground. Their reports, provided under the hospitality of the Japanese side, were also vague about how the Japanese army occupied the city and provided few explanations. This is a third point. Furthermore, the rapid "completion of their objectives and withdrawal" from Zhuzhou, and the fact that no Japanese flags were seen flying over Changsha City during the three-hundred-foot low-altitude flights, are all significant doubts. The final safety of Changsha remains to be seen as the situation unfolds, but the Japanese report that they had "completely occupied Changsha" four days ago is simply not credible.</p>
<p>The fact that the Japanese side so hastily issued this war report reflects their eagerness to win and their impatience. Their reckless and rash advance in Northern Hunan is also the result of this feeling. In fact, judging from the progress of the campaign over the past two weeks and the current situation, there is no reason for the Japanese army to be optimistic. According to the original Japanese strategy, they intended to advance on three routes simultaneously: the left wing would advance south along the Wuchang-Changsha Highway, the right wing would use warships to land troops at Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan and advance along the Xiang River, and the center route would break through Xinqiang and Miluo to probe the front of Changsha. This arrangement was far simpler in scale than the previous autumn campaign. On that occasion, another route of the Japanese army advanced from west of Jiuling along the Wuchang-Changsha Highway to probe Pingjiang, and on the western Jiangxi front, they invaded Tonggu and Xiushui from Wuning and Fengxin to outflank the Chinese army in Northern Hunan. If the Japanese plan had succeeded in its entirety at that time, the situation in Northern Hunan would have been even more dangerous than it is now. Since the Japanese army launched an offensive on the Xinqiang front on September 18th, they were blocked at Guiyi and other places on the south bank of the Miluo River on the 21st. Since then, there has been no progress on the central route. Subsequently, they advanced east along the Miluo River, turned into the highway from Wukou and Wengjiang to Changsha from Pingjiang, and approached the outskirts of Changsha in a straight-line attack. As for the Dongting Lake route, although the Japanese army landed at Ying Tian and Lu Lin Tan, the reports yesterday stated that they had been recaptured by the Chinese army, which was inferior to the time when Yinxiang was captured in the previous autumn. As a result, they failed to coordinate and converge with their left-wing units that had advanced deeply. The Japanese army on the highway was completely isolated and in deep trouble. There was nothing strange about the fact that 50,000 Japanese troops came with such fierce momentum and even approached the outskirts of Changsha or even the suburbs, and that the flat terrain was not suitable for the Chinese army to block and fight a decisive battle. However, the deeper the Japanese army invaded and the farther away from the rear, the more difficult the supply and transportation became. Except for the route of the Japanese army's advance, the entire Northern Hunan area was always under the control of the Chinese army. The danger faced by this invading Japanese army is self-evident. On September 28th, the Chinese army launched a counteroffensive behind the Japanese lines, successively recapturing Changle Street, Wukou, Xinshi, Guiyi, and Lu Lin Tan at the mouth of Dongting Lake. By this time, the Chinese army had controlled the entire line along the Miluo River from Pingjiang Zhao Ying Tian, and the Japanese army's supply line was not difficult to cut off. The tens of thousands of Japanese troops near Changsha have been struggling to break through in recent days, but based on the current situation of the two armies, it is not only insufficient to achieve anything, but is instead about to fall into the encirclement and elimination by the Chinese army. Yesterday, Anami, the commander of the Japanese army in Central China in Hankou, reiterated the old tune that "the Japanese army's purpose is not land." It is expected that the date for them to declare that they have "completed their mission and retreated" may not be far off. As for whether they will be able to "retreat safely," it depends on the results of the Chinese army's operations.</p>
<p>As indicated earlier, the Japanese side's sudden invasion of Northern Hunan was driven by an urgent desire to achieve a major victory in order to relieve their difficult internal and external situations. They specifically chose Northern Hunan as the target because they had fought there several times and were very familiar with the terrain and military situation. Furthermore, the distance from Yuezhou to Changsha was short, and there were convenient transportation routes by railway, highway, and waterway. The flat terrain there also benefited the Japanese and disadvantaged the Chinese. However, if the Japanese army wins a battle, it is only a gain obtained by avoiding the important and choosing the easy, and it is not enough to show the strength of the Japanese army. If they lose the battle, it will only further expose the decline of the Japanese army and increase the unfavorable internal and external situation. This is why they have repeatedly reinforced their forces in this campaign in order to achieve their goals. The Japanese army's offensive in Northern Hunan has now gradually reached its limit. Therefore, the war reports in the next few days will be of great and decisive significance. After a long period of recuperation, the Chinese army has newly received assistance from friendly nations in both spirit and material, and it is believed that they will not disappoint those who love justice.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Establishment of the Provisional Capital Celebrated in Chongqing; Chongqing Will Remain a Transportation Hub; Its Importance Will Not Diminish After the War</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Banners are being flown here today to celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of the provisional capital. The Central Daily News published an article stating that Chongqing's importance will not diminish after the war. From a national defense point of view, Chongqing will remain an important center. After this war ends, Japan will certainly prepare for new invasions. Today, the national defense industry is concentrated in the southwestern provinces, so Chongqing will remain an important economic center. When the Yunnan-Burma Railway opens in the future, and other important international transportation routes are built, Chongqing will remain an important transportation hub. Therefore, we firmly believe that Chongqing will remain an important and prosperous city after the war. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>Reuter, Chongqing, 1st—Dr. Stephen Pan, former professor of international relations at Providence College of Rhode Island, stated in an interview with reporters today that U.S. warships are currently escorting merchant ships through the Pacific Ocean from Australia to Batavia, Singapore, and Rangoon. Dr. Pan, who recently arrived here via the Pacific, stated that he boarded a merchant ship in San Francisco on July 9. The ship carried two light bombers and 200 trucks to the Dutch East Indies, ten P40 fighter planes, 100 trucks, 40 American volunteer pilots and mechanics, four doctors, and two nurses to China. He stated that six alerts were issued en route, but there was no activity. U.S. naval officers on board were vigilant and implemented strict light control.

The escorting U.S. cruisers remained outside territorial waters when the merchant ships approached port and departed when the merchant ships neared Singapore. Dr. Pan stated that the cargo carried by the merchant ships consisted of lend-lease supplies destined for China and the Dutch East Indies. The fleet was under the control of the U.S. Maritime Commission and arrived in Hawaii on July 16, departing twelve hours later. When outside territorial waters, a U.S. cruiser stopped the ship.

He said that they had learned enough vocabulary and aviation terms to meet their daily needs. At the same time, he lectured for one hour each day on the situation in China and Sino-American relations.</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 1st—Naval authorities yesterday declined to confirm or deny reports that the navy is protecting merchant shipping in the Pacific Ocean. The information came from Reuter, Chongqing. The so-called defensive zone has not been explained in detail. Officials have repeatedly pointed out the importance of the Far East trade route, as key raw materials are currently being transported from Malaya via the Philippines.

<p>Reuter, Honolulu, 1st—Naval officials yesterday declined to comment on reports from Chongqing that the U.S. Navy is escorting merchant ships to the Far East, stating that any comment should come from Washington.

The "Kokumin Shimbun" here declared that Japan's goal is to build a new order in East Asia, and regardless of the outcome of U.S.-Japan negotiations, this goal will not change. The Japanese government and people should be more united and strengthen national defense, as recent statements by key U.S. figures have revealed the true intentions of the U.S.</p>

<h3>Red Army Launches Counteroffensive; Situation in Leningrad Area Improves</h3>
<p>Hand-to-Hand Combat Recaptures Several Towns; German Troops Advance on Kharkov from the South</p>
<p>Reuter, Moscow, 1st—News from the front yesterday stated that the Red Army has repelled German troops surrounding Leningrad and has recaptured lost territory in several areas. The news stated that the Red Army is not only implementing its slogan of "not retreating a single step," but Soviet troops are also advancing in several places. It also stated that in the past two weeks, the enemy's vanguard has not advanced a single step. "Pravda" published a telephone message reporting that Soviet troops now have the upper hand and are launching a counteroffensive, recapturing several towns. It also stated that in one area, the German 269th Division was repelled and suffered heavy casualties. The high command stated that the Red Army is continuing to fight along the entire front but did not elaborate. The army newspaper "Red Army Daily" stated that Soviet troops repelled German troops to a considerable distance after crossing a river, annihilated an enemy regiment, and recaptured the city of "B" on the riverbank.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 1st—Kharkov, an important industrial and railway center, is now enveloped in the fog of war and is expected to be the most important battle in the Soviet-German war. Marshal Budyonny will undertake the greatest task of his professional life in this battle. Military experts state that the Soviet retreat from Poltava is the most serious threat to the most important industrial city in Ukraine and the entire Donets River basin. The Soviet retreat brings German troops within eight miles of Bizburg in southwestern Ukraine. After occupying Poltava, a city of 90,000 people, German troops also gained control of a valuable railway junction. However, the Soviet scorched-earth policy requires the Germans to repair the railway equipment extensively before it can be used. The continuous northward advance of German armored and motorized units may threaten the southern approaches to Moscow. British military experts point out that this threat is still 400 miles away, but they do not rule out the possibility of a two-pronged German attack on Moscow from the Leningrad sector in the north and from Ukraine in the south. They also state that the occupation of Kharkov is the greatest gain for the German southern army, as it can gain control of the railway to Rostov and Crimea and connect with the important railway to Moscow. Moscow claims that fierce fighting is taking place outside Crimea, indicating that German troops will continue to attack that area and prevent Soviet troops from attacking German troops advancing on Kharkov from the east.</p>
<h3>Great Battle in Ukraine Underway; Red Army Abandons Poltava</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 1st—The Soviet Information Bureau issued a war bulletin stating that on the 30th, our army engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy along the entire front. In Ukraine, our army withdrew from Poltava (75 miles southwest of Kharkov) after fierce fighting. Sixty-five enemy aircraft were shot down on the 28th, while we lost 27 aircraft.</p>
<p>International News Service, Moscow, 1st—The Soviet government bulletin today admitted that Poltava has fallen to German forces. The area is the gateway to the industrial Donets Basin. Although the Soviet side did not the loss's importance, the area is one of the ancient cities of the Soviet Union and is closely related to the rise of Imperial Russia in the 18th century. In 1709, Peter the Great defeated the Swedes there. Therefore, some believe that Soviet morale may be somewhat affected.</p>
<p>Reuter, Moscow, 1st—Soviet spokesman Lozovsky stated on Tuesday night that the German claim that the Soviet army lost 350,000 men in the Battle of Kiev was a lie, and the German claim that the Soviet army lost one million men was simply a threefold increase of the previous lie. In fact, the German army failed to encircle the Soviet army and did not capture the Soviet army. Ukraine is different from other parts of the front, as the fighting on the Ukrainian front is more fluid and has greater possibilities for movement. He knows that the great battle in Ukraine is still underway, and the German losses are high. The hope that most of the war could be resolved after the fall of Kiev has vanished. The Soviet army destroyed everything before leaving Kiev so that it would not benefit the enemy.</p>

Antonescu has also mobilized three additional legions, conscripting those under 19 years of age to meet German demands for more manpower.

He also told reporters that he had no information about the rumored U.S.-Italy political negotiations. He also said that the return of U.S. Ambassador to Italy Phillips to Washington was unrelated to the return of President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican, Taylor. He also said that he had not heard of the British plan to avoid bombing the vicinity of the Vatican City (according to overseas news, the Pope had asked Taylor to intervene with Britain so that aircraft would not bomb Rome).</p>
<p>Reuter, Washington, 1st—President Roosevelt met with congressional leaders today. Reliable sources stated last night that the President allowed them to decide what changes to make to the Neutrality Act.

<h3>Japan Admits to Encountering a Serious Crisis</h3>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 1st—The nationalist "Kokumin Shimbun" wrote in an article that although U.S.-Japan negotiations are currently underway, "expressing Japan's efforts to pursue peace and implement its policies," the number of hostile countries is gradually increasing. The ABCD encirclement against Japan is simultaneously strengthening its military bases in the southwestern Pacific.

The newspaper concluded, "We believe that the government is currently working closely with the army and navy departments to fully prepare for any major developments."</p>

<h3>Soviet Ship Carrying Rubber Leaves Thailand for Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 1st—Bangkok Japanese dispatches state that the Soviet ship "Mikoyan" (2,300 tons) left Bangkok anchorage yesterday afternoon carrying 1,000 tons of rubber, taking the route via Singapore, Hong Kong, and then to Vladivostok.</p>
<h3>Germany Implements Iron-Fisted Rule in Czechoslovakia; Nazi Executioners Launch Killing Spree; 59 Czechs Executed</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 1st—The German-controlled Prague radio station announced this morning that another 59 people had been executed by firing squad after being sentenced by a military court. Only ten of those executed's names have been released, including Dr. Grvie, a professor at the University of Brno, Colonel Kapicek, and the famous physician Vilik. It is reported that 252 people have been handed over to the German secret police, but no reason has been announced. One of them has been released.</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 1st—Reuter's diplomatic correspondent states that Czechs believe that Hitler will soon abandon the pretense of separate administrative organs in the protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia and remove President Hácha from office. The appointment of Heydrich as acting protector is noteworthy and is intended to conceal a complete change in the protectorates' status. Approximately, these two provinces may even become a region of Germany, the same as other political regions of Germany. Heydrich, known as "The Hangman", will be the head of this new region. It is believed that Germany's harsh oppression measures against Czechs are aimed at preparing for this new insult against the Czech state. According to Reuter's dispatch from the Swedish capital, a Berlin newspaper reported that Germany seems to be establishing a regime in the Czech protectorate similar to the "General Government" in Poland. As far as can be determined at this point, the current political system in the protectorate will come to an end. Because the puppet prime minister General Elias has been arrested, finding a successor is difficult or even impossible. The people's opposition to the occupying authorities is intensifying everywhere, and it appears that the people have secret paths to "other places."</p>
<h3>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Advocates Sending Troops Overseas; Britain and the U.S. Should Form a Military Alliance; Focus Efforts on Defeating Totalitarian Countries</h3>

He was speaking at the 64th annual meeting of the American Bar Association. He stated that if we want to prevent another world war from happening again, the high seas should be controlled by peace-loving and just powers - Britain and the U.S. - with no selfish desire for expansion. He said, "Frankly, we should unite our military strength and power with the military strength and power of another peace-loving great power, Britain, to stop aggression from causing global turmoil at its inception. I believe we will reach this by logic and by gradually recognizing its inevitability. We should have a period of interruption, during which we should not only work toward achieving peaceful goals but also prepare the necessary strength to force those who are unwilling to hold peace talks to accept peace. Other key points of Knox's speech called for implementing a complete military alliance with Britain, including the following points: (1) The U.S. should abandon its foolish idea of ​​not fighting unless attacked; (2) The U.S. does not have much time left to not fight. We should be determined to fight in other places outside our own land, because fighting far away is far better than fighting at home; (3) The British and U.S. navies are now clearing German pirates in the North Atlantic, resulting in the confinement of Nazi Germany on the railway; Germany will soon be destroyed within the ring of naval power; (4) Defeat totalitarian countries, the defeat of Nazism, I have no doubt, this is our national policy; (5) We are now only exerting a portion of our strength against the Nazis. We should not stop there. We should exert all or more of our strength to ensure that the sea lanes will be cleared in the future.</p>

<h3>Finance; Black Market Exchange in the Dark</h3>
<p>Buyers Can't Buy...Sellers Can't Sell</p>
<p>Good for Intermediaries...Making Deals in Between</p>
<p>The black market is still active under open secrecy. This is certainly the way things are. But it is not open, which sometimes makes it impossible for buyers to buy and sellers to sell. Feeling around in the dark. This newspaper has long said that there will be unexpected gains. Black market exchanges sometimes cannot catch the right target because the buying and selling parties change. Good for intermediaries to make extra money. There is also a saying in the market that the freeze was originally to deal with that aspect. But the strange sayings are more and more. Quite a few people say that there is still a lot of foreign exchange coming in and out from that aspect. The most incomprehensible thing is that the four major banks still cannot control foreign exchange. According to people, the export foreign exchange passes through the hands of fourteen banks, and only legal currency is given. Then it is strange that the other exchanges cannot be collected.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listings are both flat. HSBC and other small counters handled a large number of settlement applications for this month. The black market was quiet, with little formal market conditions. Speculators had a lot of short-selling in the previous month, which was offset. The price turned to the bank was US$4.75. It is heard that non-essential import foreign firms would give US$4.5 and $4.0625. The Banque de l'Indochine had several thousands for sale at $4.5625. At the close of noon, the US dollar sold for $4.5, squeezed 125. The British pound was still about 2 shillings and 8125. Wednesday afternoon with no market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 1st (Wednesday) demand. The exchange market opened flat this morning. There were still no ups and downs in the London and New York telegraphic transfers. The Shanghai exchange rose by 2 yuan, to 90 yuan and 5 jiao. The "Joint Note" black market rose slightly by 1 jiao and 3 fen, to 46 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>New Standards for Gold Futures; First Appearance; Shanghai Exchange Telegraphic Transfers Vary; Large Fluctuations in Market Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market, the November futures began to appear using the Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange as the new standard for settlement. The market was lively, but the transmission of the Shanghai Exchange price into the market was not yet properly done. Industry operators inevitably had a hard time, causing market prices to fluctuate. A portion of scalpers have returned to the market to operate. In the future, these people will see those who are familiar with the Shanghai Exchange market prices, such as Xiangxingyong, Xianghe, and Zhongxing, as targets for following the trend. In the morning, because the private telephone Shanghai Exchange dropped from 185 yuan to 183.5 yuan, the buying trend was aroused, and the Western help also competed to enter. Therefore, from the morning opening of 7,540 yuan, it gradually flew up to 7,623 yuan. It slightly turned around at 5 quarters. Unexpectedly, in the afternoon, the Shanghai rise code was 187 yuan, 3.5 yuan longer than the private telegraph. It opened low by 100 yuan in the selling trend for a while, at 7,510 yuan. The Hong Kong help bought in, and people's hearts began to settle down. It rose 60 yuan, and the market closed at 7,558 yuan. The hearts of all parties were quite unsteady. Cash transactions were thin and stable. Mingfeng entered Hesheng 30 taels, and Tianyuan and Yuxingyong each entered 10 taels. The price was all 9,300 yuan with few sellers. In the afternoon, Zhongxing entered Dafeng 50 taels, priced at 9,297 yuan. Shunyuan entered Xiangxingyong and Hongqing each 10 taels for 9,280 yuan, which ended up being the same as the closing price of the previous day. The same day was only 10 yuan higher, with more than 100 taels traded. The current price of the gold of cash number was 9,350 yuan, and the purchase was reduced by 200 yuan. The decorated gold was also sold that year.</p>
<p>Gold Futures Trading Turns Strong</p>
<p>Since 9:30 in the morning, the opening price of November gold futures was 7,540 yuan per bar (10 taels), sold by Xinyuan. They suddenly re-entered, and Ming, Xinfengyong, Dingsheng, Xiangxingyong, Yifeng, and others came in one after another. It immediately rose to 7,585 yuan, sold by Tianyuan and Xianghe. It went down to 7,570 yuan. Chengda, Xiangxingyong, Fukangyong, and Tianyuan bought in again, and the Shanghai exchange opened from 185 yuan to 183.5 yuan, and the price flew out of 7,600 yuan. Tianyuan entered 7,620 yuan, Yili and Xinyuan sold it out. It retreated to 7,620 yuan. At noon, Hongqingyong and Xinfengyong entered again, raising it to 7,623 yuan. Chengda and Da sold out, and the noon closing was 7,606 yuan. In the afternoon, the Shanghai exchange suddenly reported 187 yuan at 1:20, which was 3.5 yuan longer. People's hearts were greatly frustrated, and the price retreated wildly. The opening price at 1 o'clock was as low as 7,510 yuan, 94 yuan lower. Because Xianghe and Hengji each entered more than 100 taels, there were few treasure holders at the time, and the price flew up 60 yuan, and was stirred up to 7,570 yuan. It was sold by Da and Xiangxingyong at that time and dropped to 7,540 yuan. The closing price at 4:30 was 7,558. There was a high and low of 113 yuan that day.</p>
<p>There is no change in decorated gold</p>
<p>The price of decorated gold per tael at Yinlou, Da Tonghang, and Xin Tonghang is still 950 yuan, and the purchase is reduced by 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Rising Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency situation, the British and American gold pounds and British gold notes were quite stable, and the market price was flat. The US dollar notes tended to rise again, and the evening market rose again to 22 yuan and 5 jiao, up 2 jiao and 5 fen from the previous day. The trend of Hong Kong notes was stable, and the market price was flat. There was also no change in the Japanese gold notes, and the evening market was still at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, and 6 fen. Korean chestnuts rose slightly, and the evening market was as high as 2 yuan and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Securities; Domestic Debt Storing Power to Act</h3>
<p>Public debt black market, yesterday's market had news of British and American loans to China, and news of continued negotiations between the US and Japan. The market's heart strengthened again. It happened that the Sichuan gang had completely sold out yesterday, and the market price rose and gradually became powerful. If there are no other obstacles, high prices can be seen again. Yesterday morning, the market was flat, and Yongchang continued to buy in. Most of the others were retail investors absorbing. Wutai transferred the sale, and Fufu also bought in. Lianyi's bulls increased the code, and the high price of Class C saw 2 yuan and 2 jiao. Tongshun, Rende, and Zhongfu sold a lot. The market closed slightly tired. As a result, the market price rose again by 2 jiao and 5 fen to 4 or 5 jiao, and the turnover was about 1.3 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the previous day</p>
<p>Unified A 78.40 77.85 78.30 Up 0.50</p>
<p>Unified B 73.30 72.80 73.10 Up 0.30</p>

In addition, the stock market of the Public Association was quiet. The trading of several famous stocks turned strong, and the price tended to rise. Huidefeng and Yihua are examples of this. The telephone stock suddenly attracted attention, with an opening price of 39 yuan, and it gradually rose to 41 yuan at the close. There were still many rubber stock transactions, and the average price was lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>London, 30th (Tuesday), today's listed market prices of foreign bonds and Far East British company stocks, bank stocks were the only ones that showed improvement.

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Telegraphs of Orders from Southeast Asia Arrive in a Flurry; New Prices for "Double Horse" Brand Emerge Endlessly; Bears Can Only Pay High Prices for Overnight Swaps</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which had risen and then fallen the previous day, opened flat yesterday but then turned upward again. The rising momentum intensified, with new highs emerging continuously. This was due to continuous overseas transactions, with telegraphs of orders from Southeast Asia arriving in a flurry, causing the "Double Horse" factory's inventory to become increasingly tight. As a result, although the bears fought tirelessly, they felt a significant lack of chips. Recently, before the close of the market, the situation appeared quite weak. However, after the close, there was a sudden surge in prices, indicating the scarcity of warehouse receipts. Unable to cope, the bears had no choice but to seek overnight swaps at high prices. Given this, the market is unlikely to loosen. However, short sellers remain enthusiastic, believing that they can profit if the situation changes. As for Hong Kong traders, transactions were quieter. However, some say that spot goods are scarce in the market, and the factory has reduced production, resulting in weak output. The high price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 1,855 yuan, and the low price was 1,824 yuan. The opening was very firm in the early afternoon. Compared to the morning close, it suddenly rose seven or eight yuan to 1,848 yuan. However, floating shorts were still active, weakening to 1,843 yuan. But with tight warehouse receipts, it rose again to 1,852 yuan. Near the close, there were rumors that a certain speculator suddenly sold a huge amount of 4,000 to 5,000 bales, causing the price to fall to 1,840 yuan, but it was all bought up by large players. The closing price was 1,842 yuan. After the close, the bears lacked sufficient warehouse receipts, and the swap price was very high, reaching seven or eight jiao per piece, with many buyers competing. It rose again to 1,847 or 1,848 yuan. Today, 330 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped, and another 1,530 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The "Double Horse" opening this morning was peaceful, with the initial price at 1,832 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 1,835 yuan, but the trading was normal, and it loosened to 1,824 yuan. Subsequently, upon hearing that the cotton yarn market in the exchange was rising step by step, people's spirits were lifted. Those who usually shorted scrambled to cover their positions, and the market was driven upward, gradually rising to 1,855 yuan. However, a certain large player took profits on their long positions, and it loosened again to 1,841 yuan. But after the close, the public competed to buy, rising to 1,847 or 1,848 yuan. Statistics show that 15,020 bales were traded during the half-day. The amount bought by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Southeast Asia: 20; Fellow Traders: 15,000</p>
<p>Total: 15,020</p>
<p>"Golden Double Horse" futures, with factory orders reportedly doing briskly, and rumors of lifting the ban and releasing goods causing a stir, trended high throughout the day. In particular, the squeeze on the current month seemed to be materializing. However, new shorts for the distant December contract were still quite active. The market atmosphere was not as enthusiastic as yesterday, mainly because factory orders were slightly firmer. The morning opening for October was 1,720 yuan, already up 10 yuan and 5 jiao from yesterday. After the initial auction, each month rose by about five or six yuan. October: 1,716 yuan and 5 jiao, November: 1,715 yuan, December: 1,750 yuan were the opening prices. In the second session, October continued to strengthen, rising to 1,720 yuan and 5 jiao. November then became brisk, with new buying pushing it up to 1,724 yuan. December remained strong, reaching 1,761 yuan. In the third session, the market atmosphere continued to rise, with the near-term October contract at 1,730 yuan and 5 jiao, and November at 1,733 yuan, the closing price for the morning session. December, however, fell back by three yuan, with a closing price of 1,758 yuan. In the two afternoon sessions, people's minds were very stable. They wanted to weaken but couldn't, and wanted to rise but lacked strength. After several complexities, there were general fluctuations of three to five yuan. October opened at 1,732 yuan and closed at 1,729 yuan. November opened at 1,735 yuan and closed at 1,732 yuan and 5 jiao. December opened at 1,760 yuan and closed at 1,758 yuan and 5 jiao. The highest price for the whole day was 1,734 yuan for October, 1,735 yuan for November, and 1,744 yuan for December. The total trading volume for the morning and afternoon sessions was over 15,000 bales, with October and December being particularly active. Compared to the previous day, October rose by 19 yuan and 5 jiao, November rose by 22 yuan, and December rose by 12 yuan. A table is listed below:</p>

<p>Comparison Up 9.5 Up 4.5 Up 3.0</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Remain Firm and Brisk</h3>
<p>Although trading in the spot cotton market is not active, prices remain firm and brisk, rising every day. The reason is that market inventories are thin, and the supply is uncertain. In particular, the price of coarse cotton has risen sharply, with 23-count American Pengjiapu cotton approaching 600 yuan. The price of "Fire Engine" cotton is 345 yuan, with 300 bales reportedly traded.</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton: 125 pieces, 710.0 Jiaxin Second Factory</p>

<p>The New York cotton market rose due to European political news favoring the long side, as well as the strong rise in stocks on Wall Street. Traders and speculators actively bought in, and short covering was also very active. As a result, the closing price was about 14 or 15 points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was closed yesterday for a bank holiday. As for the forecast for the opening market today, it is expected to be one rupee higher due to the rise in cotton prices.</p>
<h3>Grains: New Rice Arrives Continuously, but Rice Prices Are Still Controlled</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market initially weakened and then rose, presenting a prosperous scene again. Initially, due to the weakening trend from the previous night, although there was some purchasing by traders, the market was difficult to recover. Moreover, with the official announcement that 58,000 bags of warehouse rice would be sold publicly at a low price of 110 yuan after ten days, and the wholesale price also reduced to 133 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, and with 2,000 tons of publicly sold rice under negotiation, the market price was weak. Bank godown rice was officially sold at 115 yuan, and small godown rice was sold at 114 yuan by outside godowns. However, after the price weakened, traders seized the opportunity to buy at low prices, especially speculative groups, and skin ball trading was particularly active. The market immediately turned from weak to brisk. It was also heard that the telegraph price for small godown rice was 136 yuan, 1 jiao, 7 fen and 6 li, but it is difficult to predict whether it can be restored. Therefore, the market price immediately rose with people's spirits. Small Aya rice also reached 118 yuan and 5 jiao. It was slightly flat in the afternoon, and the closing price fell back by half a yuan. English-style spot goods were 139 yuan to 142 yuan and 7 jiao, secondary was 136 yuan and 5 jiao, and road rice was 145 yuan and 5 jiao. Compared to the previous market, it was generally larger by 23 yuan. 25,000 bags of spot rice and 1,000 tons of English-style rice were traded.</p>
<p>The prices of thick and thin, new and broken domestic rice varied yesterday. New rice from the South Port was in high demand, with prices continuing to rise by three or four yuan, opening at 150 yuan and then at 147 yuan. Thick broken rice from Wuxi was relatively old, so it was just average, still selling for 150 yuan. The arrival of new rice was slightly less than before, but the sales path was still smooth, so the price continued to depreciate. New Kunshan rice opened at 150 yuan, then at 147 yuan. New Dujian rice from Kunshan was already on the market yesterday, but the quantity was still small, only about thirty dan in total. The quality was good, so the sales were quite hot, opening at 127 yuan and 126 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice was initially average, but later tightened with foreign rice. Both retail and wholesale were quite active, so the market was stronger than before, opening at 142 yuan for special Hong Kong glutinous rice, 140 yuan for ordinary glutinous rice, 138 yuan, 136 yuan for yellow second glutinous rice, 131 yuan for glutinous rice, and 130 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Stockpiling Does Not Decline; How Can Flour Prices Fall?</h3>
<p>Foreign flour has arrived again. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 9,161 bags of flour from Hong Kong. It docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload.</p>
<p>Yesterday's opening price of foreign flour was immediately snapped up by local traders who were stockpiling and taking advantage of low prices. Coupled with the recovery of foreign rice and the persistence of those holding goods, the market atmosphere in the morning was tense, so the opening price immediately rose by two or three jiao. Fort opened at 35 yuan and 5 fen, and Golden Dragon West Godown opened at 33 yuan and 5 fen. Subsequently, with undiminished buying interest and strong demand for transshipment, and with speculators further taking profits, although there were profitable long positions being released, prices continued to rise. Fort rose to 35 yuan and 3 jiao, West Godown Golden Dragon to 33 yuan and 6 jiao, rising to 33 yuan and 9 jiao. Five Swallow and Red Sun, which had been lowered by three or four jiao the day before and lacked buyers, were all sold at 34 yuan and 6 jiao yesterday. However, after a period of consolidation in the afternoon, the evening close was slightly flat. Fort closed at 35 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, West Godown Golden Dragon at 33 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, still better than the previous night by three or four jiao. Wheat inventories are low, and godown goods are still priced at 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: 2,000 Pieces of Soybean Oil Arrive in Shanghai; Oil Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the speculative buying trend in the edible oil market, driven by rice merchants, foreign rice merchants, and yarn dealers, turned strong again. With rice prices rising and yarn prices increasing, rice and yarn merchants disregarded sales conditions and launched another round of price increases. As a result, vegetable oil and cottonseed oil futures were all raised by four or five yuan, and raw soybean oil and other oils also tightened. A total of over 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, nearly 1,000 dan of Daya Factory vegetable oil, and over 10,000 dan of Qing oil futures were sold. (Prices are detailed in the market price column)</p>
<p>In addition, 2,000 pieces of soybean oil were transported from Tianjin yesterday. Today, 250 pieces of soybean cake will be transported to...</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Granulated Sugar Continues to Arrive in Shanghai; Sugar Prices Rise Again for No Reason</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market tightened again, and there was a rebound of three yuan to several jiao. The guild's benchmark prices were as follows: Spot 24 coarse white, imported on September 16th, was 148 yuan, 7 jiao to 9 jiao and 5 fen, up 7 jiao; imported in August was 148 yuan to 8 yuan and 8 jiao, up 3 jiao; imported in July was 147 yuan and 6 jiao, up 6 jiao; imported in June was 146 yuan and 8 jiao, up 8 jiao.

Taikoo car white B was 163 yuan, up 1 yuan. HX was 144 yuan, up 3 yuan. H car red was 126 yuan, up 7 yuan and 5 jiao compared to September 27th.

Delivery on the 20th was 147 yuan, 2 jiao to 9 yuan, 4 jiao and 8 jiao, temporarily returning to 7 yuan and 2 jiao, closing at 8 yuan and 8 jiao, up 1 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<p>Granulated sugar continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Hanyang ship arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying not only a large batch of flour from Hong Kong, but also 4,300 bags of sugar. It docked at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession to unload.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Southeast Asian Merchants and Dye Factories Scour the Market; Spot Goods of Eastern Fine Twill Rise Sharply; Sales Prices Rise Sharply by More Than Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market trend was firm, and people's minds were inclined towards rising prices. However, actual sales business for Southeast Asian and Hong Kong merchants was slightly dampened due to the lack of ships. Local shops were also sparse due to the approaching festival, while transactions between fellow traders and stockpilers were the most frequent. Sales prices for coarse and fine cloth twill rose by 5 jiao to 7 jiao and 5 fen per piece, and bleached and dyed cloth rose by about 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Spot goods of fine twill rose the fastest, as Southeast Asian merchants and dye factories repeatedly searched the market. Goods were scarce, with each piece rising sharply by a huge amount of 2 yuan to 2 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>

<h3>Foreign Merchants Seek to Save Fuel; Advocate Continuous Office System</h3>
<p>Lunch and rest times are canceled; Staff travel expenses can also be reduced</p>
<p>Police matters and Chinese banks are still difficult to adopt</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News says that the office hours of some merchants in the city have implemented a one-shift method, that is, continuous office hours every day, canceling meal rest times, and finishing work early. It is heard that the American Chamber of Commerce also supports American firms in Shanghai to adopt this method, so as to save the city's fuel reserves this winter.</p>
<p>Some American Merchants Have Already Implemented</p>
<p>The secretary of the American Chamber of Commerce, Huo Si, has sent a letter to all members urging them to implement a one-shift method in their offices immediately. The letter briefly stated that in view of the necessity of saving coal reserves in the city this winter, the implementation of the one-shift method is very important. Some American businesses have already implemented this method. The office hours they have set are generally from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm. However, other merchants can imitate this and choose appropriate hours to achieve the same savings effect. The board of directors of the American Chamber of Commerce proposed a suggestion at a meeting a few days ago and considered this matter, which was unanimously approved.</p>
<p>Police Matters Are Difficult to Adopt</p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the Public Works Department's reply to reporters, the board of directors of the bureau has not discussed this matter. Changing office hours may reduce the fuel expenditure of merchants, but the bureau must maintain necessary services such as police and fire protection, so it is difficult to take this measure. It is heard that the Shanghai branches of large commercial firms such as Mobil Oil Company and British American Tobacco Company have started the one-shift work method. It is expected that other American firms will also change their current office hours after the Chamber of Commerce discusses it.</p>
<p>Chinese Banks Are Expected to Reject</p>
<p>However, Chinese banks are expected to reject this matter, while foreign banks and brokers may continue to work during normal winter hours. According to various opinions, the effect of changing office hours to a one-shift method will greatly reduce fuel consumption this winter, and commercial firm employees will also benefit from it, because those who usually travel back and forth twice a day will only need to travel once, saving half of their travel expenses.</p>
<p>British Chamber of Commerce to Meet Today</p>
<p>The British Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to hold a meeting this afternoon (2nd) to discuss one-shift office hours, so as to save fuel and enable employees to save on travel expenses. This proposal, if decided, will be reported by the president of the Chamber of Commerce, Marshall, to be adopted by British commercial firms in the port. Although it cannot be determined what kind of office hours are applicable to general positions, it is believed that this proposal will be welcomed. American commercial firms have implemented a one-shift office system, and the hours they use are generally from 8:00 am to 1:00 pm. The vice president of the American Chamber of Commerce, Ni Gu'er, said that these hours may not be applicable to some companies, but other hours may be adopted, as long as they are in line with the principle of saving.</p>
<h3>The Whole City Prepares to Warmly Celebrate the Double Tenth Festival; Suspend Flags and Take a Holiday to Promote the Economy and Disaster Relief Movement</h3>
<p>October 10th is the National Day anniversary of the Great Republic of China. The people of all walks of life in the city do not intend to be extravagant due to the special environment of Shanghai. They decided to suspend flags and take a holiday as usual, and enthusiastically promote the Great Movement. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Whole City Suspends Flags to Extend Celebrations Together</p>
<p>All organs, groups, schools, post offices, customs, factories, shops, and households in the city have decided to hang the Qing Tian Bai Ri flag uniformly for one day and take a holiday to celebrate, in accordance with the flag-hanging measures agreed upon by various public groups and the concession authorities, in order to commemorate the Double Tenth National Day. However, as it is a time of crisis and national disasters are rampant, they are following the central government's order and will not hold grand celebrations. Each school will hold commemorative ceremonies separately. In addition to suspending flags and taking holidays to celebrate, the embassies and consulates of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France stationed in Shanghai, as well as the concession authorities, will also hang flags on foreign ships docked in the Huangpu River to celebrate.</p>
<p>Offering Money for Disaster Relief to Be Promoted Separately</p>
<p>In order to celebrate the National Day, all walks of life in the city have launched four major movements to express the patriotic enthusiasm of the entire city: (1) continuing to offer money, (2) donating money in lieu of winter clothes, (3) saving money for disaster relief, (4) national construction savings. All fundraising aspects will be promoted separately by each industry. After the funds are collected, they will be sent to the designated receiving agencies for submission to the central government or charitable organizations for distribution.</p>
<p>Early Account Settlement and Joint Defense</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions, in view of the Double Tenth National Day being a great revolutionary anniversary in China, and connected to the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar, in order to ensure the safety of the area, have decided to implement joint security starting from the 4th (because the 5th is the Mid-Autumn Festival account settlement period). In addition to prohibiting all gatherings, associations, parades, and demonstrations, they will strictly enforce curfew laws and order all detectives to be dispatched to protect account settlement and ensure a peaceful passage through this revolutionary anniversary. The defense forces of various countries and the International Settlement Volunteers will assist the concession authorities in security as needed.</p>
<h3>Importers Apply for Foreign Exchange and Provide Guarantees</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange measures of the Exchange Equalization Fund will remain largely unchanged in October. However, there will be improvements in the procedures to ensure strictness. In the past, applications for foreign exchange to the Exchange Equalization Fund were submitted by banks on behalf of importers. From now on, the importer must fill out the application form in person, which will be submitted by the bank to the Exchange Equalization Fund with a guarantee clause. In addition to requiring the applicant to provide various documents, if the Exchange Equalization Fund finds that the imported goods do not match those stated in the application, the importer is willing to sell all of the foreign exchange obtained from the Exchange Equalization Fund back to the Exchange Equalization Fund at the exchange rate at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>Application Forms Will Be Standardized</p>
<p>In the past, there were three types of application forms, and the paper color was different because each bank printed them themselves. In the future, they will be unified into two types, all using white paper, in four copies. Three copies will be sent to the Exchange Equalization Fund, and one copy will be kept by the bank. For items that comply with the first two requirements, that is, goods allowed to be imported in Schedules A and B, and minor imported items not listed in Schedules A and B and the list of prohibited imported items, the first type will be used when applying for foreign exchange. The second type will be used for personal remittances, travel expenses, and insurance premiums when applying for foreign exchange. In the first type, items D and E in section 5 originally only needed to state the country of production and manufacture and the country from which they were imported. In the future, the place of manufacture and shipment and the manufacturer must be clearly stated. Currently, the foreign banks are being printed by the Maxxley Bank, and the Chinese banks are being printed by the Bank of China, according to the form set by the Exchange Equalization Fund. After printing, the two banks will distribute them to other banks for use. In general, all banks can follow the procedures starting next Monday.</p>
<p>Business Representatives Go to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Zi Lin West News reported that regarding the foreign exchange issue, it is recently learned that many business representatives from the Wood Port have left Shanghai for Hong Kong. The most encouraging ones are several representatives from the insurance and silk cloth industries. It is learned that all merchants in the port applying for foreign exchange have been approved, except for those who have been rejected for non-compliance. In the past few days, export trade from the port to the Dutch East Indies has been very active, especially the export of cloth, which is a large amount. There are many export bills of exchange, and it is expected that the tension in foreign exchange will soon ease.</p>
<h3>Gausm's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China Gausm returned to Shanghai by boat from Beiping last Sunday morning. Accompanying him was French Embassy Counselor to China, Castile. Castile will stay in Shanghai for a short period of time, but the future whereabouts of the French Ambassador will be to Ping or the wartime capital of China, but it is still unknown. However, as Gausm has been away from Chongqing for a long time, it is possible that he will go to Chongqing. However, according to the Zi Lin West News, the French Ambassador will remain in Shanghai for a week and then return to Beiping. The French Embassy is unwilling to disclose the Ambassador's future whereabouts.</p>
<h3>High Tide in Huangpu River Tomorrow</h3>
<p>There will be a high tide in the Huangpu River starting tomorrow, which will be larger than previous ones. The predicted quantity is around 13 feet. At that time, low-lying roads will see tidal waters surging again. Also, one of the Pacific hurricanes is trending towards Hong Kong, but the progress is winding and may dissipate. The other direction has turned and will approach Kyushu, Japan. Shanghai can avoid the attack.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Travelers to Hong Kong Carrying Money</h3>
<p>It has recently been learned from shipping circles in the port that the Hong Kong government will set a new limit on the amount of various currencies that travelers to Hong Kong can carry. It is heard that each traveler is only allowed to carry the equivalent of five hundred pounds upon landing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Control of Export Trade Shows Flexibility; Threatens to Shift Based on the Attitude of Britain and the United States; This Principle Applies to Shanghai as Well</h3>
<p>The Times reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy in the port stated at a Japanese press briefing yesterday to foreign journalists that the Japanese control over American export trade in the occupied areas (including Shanghai) is now showing a tendency to ease. This was the spokesman's answer to a question from an American journalist. The reporter quoted recent figures released by the US authorities, showing that American export trade from Tianjin totaled $200,000 for the entire month of August and $600,000 for the month of September up to the 25th. The reporter asked the spokesman to explain whether this was due to the Japanese easing of trade controls in Tianjin. The spokesman replied that there were many factors involved in this issue, and any progress in trade was not necessarily due to the easing of control regulations. However, it can be said that the control measures are now showing a tendency to ease. The control regulations have flexibility and largely depend on the actions taken by Britain and the United States in the Far East. The spokesman then answered the reporter's question with a "long-term vision," stating that trade control depends on the relationship between Britain and the United States and the entire Far East. Therefore, his remarks on the easing of trade control also apply to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>American Film Industry Representative Goes to Hong Kong to Discuss Obtaining Foreign Exchange; Haig Will Meet with Fox After Arriving in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>It has recently been learned that Haig, President of Asia Theatres Corporation, representing the American film distribution companies and theater companies in the city, has set off for Hong Kong to discuss with Falker and other members of the Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee in order to obtain sufficient foreign exchange so that the American film distributors here can</p>
<p>Remit Funds to the United States</p>
<p>The General Manager of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation in Shanghai, and Chairman of the Chinese Film Merchants Association, Babu, stated this morning (1st) that the result of Haig's discussions with the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee is of great importance. The film distributors here have telegraphed the New York headquarters about this matter, fearing that if the funds cannot be remitted to New York, then there will be</p>
<p>No New Films Coming</p>
<p>to China. If the Exchange Equalization Fund does not allow the film companies to remit foreign exchange to the United States, then this matter will not only affect Shanghai but also the whole of China, including Hong Kong. Haig left Shanghai for Hong Kong two days ago on the President Asia, and is expected to arrive there in the next two days.</p>
<h3>Sale of Public Rice: Registration Required</h3>
<p>The Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee has decided to entrust the sale of over 58,000 bags of the second batch of public warehouse rice to various rice shops within the two concessions at prevailing market prices. It is learned that all rice shops can send personnel with their company chop to the industry association to register starting from the 3rd of this month, fill out subscription forms, and the association will issue payment slips. Rice shops can use this slip to directly make payments at the Fuyuan Money Exchange on Ningbo Road in the Public Concession and exchange them for delivery orders. The payment date is limited to within five days from the date of registration, and delivery will be in the order of payment receipt.</p>
<p>Rice Industry Announcement</p>
<p>The Rice Shop Industry Association yesterday announced to the rice market that they had received notification from the Shanghai Rice Public Warehouse Management Committee to designate member rice shops to sell over 50,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice on their behalf. The regulation sets the price for rice shops at 133 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen per bag (including the bag, 234 pounds), equivalent to 107 yuan per stone. The rice shops are not allowed to sell to consumers for more than 110 yuan per stone (net weight 160 jin). All rice shops must start selling from their stores at 9:00 AM on October 11th. This low-price sale of warehouse rice aims to benefit ordinary people. Therefore, the sale of rice is mainly for retail consumers, and each household cannot purchase more than one stone. We have copied the brief rules for the first low-price sale of warehouse rice and requested notification to member rice shops for subscription, etc. The association convened a meeting of directors and supervisors and resolved to allocate this public warehouse rice to member rice shops in the concessions for sale. Registration will be handled by the association first. The registration dates are set as follows: (1) October 3rd for member rice shops in the Public Concession; (2) October 4th for member rice shops in the French Concession; (3) October 5th for member rice shops in the Hongkou District; (4) October 6th for member rice shops in the West Shanghai District. The quantities of warehouse rice for sale are divided into three types: 100 bags, 50 bags, and 25 bags. If there are no retail facilities, no allocation will be made and it will be recorded. All member rice shops in the concession districts are requested to check the above dates, send personnel with their chops to the association to complete the registration procedures from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day. The deadline will be strictly enforced, please do not delay. Furthermore, when the warehouse rice is sold out, the empty bags belong to the rice shops. Rice shops selling the rice must establish a separate warehouse rice ledger to record the quantity of low-price warehouse rice sold each day and the exact amount of legal tender received in detail. Even if only one jin of rice is sold, and the legal tender received is only a few jiao, it must be clearly recorded separately for the public warehouse association to inspect.</p>
<h3>American Wheat Aids Haining Disaster: First Two Batches Already Distributed</h3>
<p>The American Red Cross's wheat assistance to China: Fellow Haining natives in Shanghai stated that after the military disasters in various towns and villages of the county, followed by drought and flood disasters, and this year affected by wind and rain, most of the disaster victims are struggling on the brink of starvation. Therefore, they initially obtained 1,000 bags of relief wheat from the Shanghai representative of the American Red Cross. With the assistance of American Pastor George of the Jiaxing Jesus Church and Reverend Ye Ruishan of the church, they went to various districts in Haining, including Xie Guo, Zhou Chang, Yuan Xia, and Yuan Dong, to conduct on-site investigations and distribute to extremely poor households. However, due to the large number of disaster victims, the relief was insufficient. A second batch of 3,000 bags of American wheat was obtained and distributed under the direction of Pastor Hua. The results of the investigation showed that Yuanhua Town suffered the most severe military disaster, unmatched in Zhejiang Province. Reverend Ye Ruishan and others witnessed the severity of the disaster. Therefore, 680 bags of the second batch of American wheat were allocated to Yuanhua Town and surrounding areas, including Pu [], in conjunction with local Pastor Zhang Yinsheng to distribute relief in Yuanhua Town and surrounding areas, including Pu [ ]. However, the coastal residents along the 60 li embankment inside and outside the Jiucang were also extremely poor and are still planning to distribute to save those on the verge of death, but there are only a few dozen bags of relief wheat left.</p>

<h3>Bombing Case on Henry Road: Gangsters Mistake the Victim: Aim Was to Intimidate Tao Zuichou</h3>
<p>The residence at No. 1, Lane 34, Henry Road, French Concession, the home of Tao Jiwei, a former employee of the Hongkou Branch of the Bank of Communications, was the target of a small hand grenade placed by gangsters. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the purpose of the bombing was to intimidate Tao Zuichou, a comprador for the Hongyun Shipping Bureau. Because Tao also resides near the address, the gangsters who threw the bomb mistakenly believed that Tao Jiwei's residence was Tao Zuichou's residence, deliberately throwing the bomb to intimidate him and extort money. After the incident, the police conducted an investigation and, because the letter inside the paper wrapping of the bomb mentioned Tao Zuichou, summoned Tao Zuichou for detailed questioning in order to find clues to arrest the gangsters.</p>

<h3>US Efforts on National Defense Program: Talk with Bode Back in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Bode, Registrar of St. John's University, returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon on the Tailuo ship from the United States. According to a reporter, the American people are increasingly interested in the Chinese question and are particularly concerned about the current situation in China. Therefore, when he lectured on the Chinese question on the West Coast of the United States, he was very well received by the audience. Mr. Bode was accompanied by 81 people, including Mr. Norden, principal of St. John's Middle School, and Professor Seleven of economics. According to Seleven, in recent months, due to the implementation of various national defense programs in the United States, the cost of living for the people has also been increasing daily. For example, in the area of Dede Li, due to the development of military industries, other industries have been greatly affected, and the local situation has also changed. At present, American youth must undergo one year of military training, which has resulted in a 25% decrease in university students. The automobile industry has been most affected by military industries, with factories focusing on the production of military supplies, resulting in a significant reduction in automobile production.</p>

<p>Served as Manager</p>
<p>The Lunhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory in this city is very large in scale and has been established for many years. The factory address is located at Nos. 3, 4, and 5, Qunyi Fang, Lane 446, Ningbo Road, with an attached business department. There is also a second factory located at No. 558 Haifang Road, also with an attached business department. Wu Bonian, a native of Ningbo, serves as the manager. Wu lives in the main factory and has a car with license plate No. 810 for transportation, driven by the driver Chen Mei Wang (a native of Ningbo).</p>
<p>Four Gangsters Kidnap</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:30 AM, Wu took the car from the main factory to the second factory on Haifang Road to work. Unexpectedly, as the car slowly turned at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Fujian Road, four kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two of the gangsters held pistols, stepped forward to block the way, and after some intimidation, they successively jumped into the car, forcing Chen to drive east and flee to Huankou Road towards the Bund. The driver Chen Mei Wang was expelled on the Bund, and the gangsters drove away themselves, and their whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>Fled South</p>
<p>After the incident, Chen returned to the factory to report and reported the situation to the police in charge, requesting them to investigate the whereabouts. The police received the news and immediately sent detectives to the scene to investigate. They also took the driver Chen Mei Wang to the police station to inquire about the circumstances of the incident and ordered him to strictly investigate the traces of the gangsters. It is reported that after the gangsters kidnapped the victim, they drove to the Bund and seemed to have fled south without a trace. Therefore, the police have been making every effort to investigate along this line and have notified the French police to pay attention to the traces of the car.</p>
<h3>Xie Da Xiang Silk Fabric Store Thrown Two Bombs</h3>
<p>The Xie Ren Xiang Silk Fabric Store, a branch of the Great World, located at No. 25 Mintini Yin Road, French Concession, was suddenly attacked by two sulfur bombs thrown inside at around 7:30 PM last night. For a time, thick smoke filled the air, and pedestrians and customers in the store were shocked and fled in panic. After the police received the news, they sent a police car to arrest the perpetrators, but they were nowhere to be found.</p>
<h3>High-Priced Search for Nickel Coins: Russian Man Deceived and Case Solved</h3>
<p>Most hardware items are related to military use, so there are many people looking for them on the market, resulting in prices soaring day by day. Recently, some people have also been purchasing nickel coins of 20 points, 10 points, and 5 points that were previously circulating on the market at high prices. Five 20-point nickel coins can be exchanged for as much as 8 or 9 yuan in legal tender. In addition to searching everywhere,</p>
<p>High-Priced Purchase</p>
<p>What is the purpose of these people is difficult for outsiders to know in detail. In addition to the Chinese, there are also Russians involved in this business. A Russian named Bao Lisuofu, who lives at No. 239 Hamilton Building, Fuzhou Road, is one of the people engaged in this business. Recently, through the introduction of Shan Tong Ji Bian Dakefu, he purchased 700 pounds of nickel coins from Cheng Mao Money Shop at No. 266 Zhejiang Road.</p>
<p>Unit Price Per Pound</p>
<p>Was 82 yuan in legal tender, totaling 57,400 yuan. However, recently, it was discovered that it contained 330 pounds of copper pieces, and the market price of these copper pieces is only 3 yuan 5 jiao per pound, and the estimated loss is 27,060 yuan. Bao reported this to the Central Police Station, and Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui and Detective Mao Yunlong.</p>
<p>Under Investigation</p>
<p>First, Bian Dakefu was arrested, and then Zhu Sixian (accountant of Shen Da Cheng), Zhang Xianji, and Yang Liang, who acted as intermediaries, were arrested at Shen Da Cheng Dim Sum Shop at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road and Room 317 of the Daran Hotel at No. 317 Zhifu Road. Hu Shunfu and Jin Aisheng were also arrested at Cheng Mao Money Shop, while the owner of the shop, Wang Bosheng, and the accountant Chen Zhichang, are both at large. Yesterday morning,</p>
<p>The Arrested Criminals</p>
<p>Were sent to the Fifth Criminal Division of the Special Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunji stated that the case still needs to be investigated and the accomplices need to be arrested, so he requested permission to temporarily detain them and reschedule the interrogation. After Judge Meng Tingke interrogated them, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the interrogation.</p>

<h3>New Blood Transfusion Method</h3>
<p>— Suitable for All</p>
<p>Since the invention of blood transfusions, countless people suffering from excessive blood loss due to accidental injuries have been saved, and countless dying anemic patients have been able to continue their lives. This is one of the great contributions of the medical community in the past.</p>
<p>However, based on the clinical experiments of many medical experts over the past few decades, it is felt that the application of blood transfusions cannot be popularized. The reasons for this are probably twofold: First, the source of blood comes from another person, and in today's money-oriented world, the value of blood is quite expensive (approximately 20 yuan for 100 c.c.); many poor patients often die because they cannot afford to buy blood. Second, there is the limitation of time: Often, when patients with acute illnesses need blood, it is quite difficult to find a suitable person for transfusion within a certain time. Although organizations such as blood transfusion companies have recently been established to remedy this second shortcoming, it remains a serious problem in remote and inaccessible areas. In order to avoid the above two inconveniences, many medical experts are working daily to improve the situation. Recently, Dr. Xu Bao Yi, a professor at Aurora University Medical College, and his medical students have found a suitable and reasonable method, which is the new blood transfusion method I am going to discuss.</p>
<p>This method is exactly the same as surgery and intravenous injection. As for the source of blood, it does not come from another person, but is taken from the umbilical cord connecting the mother and the baby immediately after birth. This is undoubtedly a new discovery in the Chinese medical community.</p>
<p>Originally, when the fetus is in the mother's placenta, its nutrition is entirely supplied by the mother's blood through the umbilical cord. After the baby is born, the blood in the umbilical cord near the baby's head gradually coagulates, and the blood near the placenta also begins to coagulate. At this time, the placenta has not yet fallen off, and there is still some blood in the umbilical cord. At this time, wash the outer part of the umbilical cord with medicinal liquid, and then make a small cut in the umbilical cord to allow the blood that is about to coagulate to flow into a small bottle. Then, filter the blood in the bottle once and then test whether it contains bacteria. After testing, if there are no bacteria in the blood, then test the blood type (Groupesanguin) and put the same blood types together for application.</p>
<p>When blood is collected in this way, adding several chemical agents can prevent it from coagulating immediately. The composition of these chemical agents is as follows:</p>
<p>Serum Physiologigu e sale. 1000c.c.</p>
<p>Citrate de soude 105g.</p>
<p>Glucose 0.5cg.</p>
<p>Sulganilamide 1,5g.</p>
<p>If this blood is stored in a refrigerator, it can be preserved for up to fifteen days (this is the current situation, and the date may be extended in the future). When a patient needs a blood transfusion, inject the blood of the same type as the patient into a vein. Therefore, the operation is not necessarily troublesome, but the two difficulties mentioned earlier have been solved. The detailed method of collecting blood will be published in the upcoming Aurora Medical Journal for the reference of all medical experts.</p>
<p>To date, dozens of patients have been saved by Dr. Xu's injection of this type of blood. The patients are in very good condition after the blood transfusion and have no adverse reactions. Therefore, there is no doubt that this method will be adopted by medical experts in the near future.</p>
<p>Recently, Dr. Xu is leading students from Aurora University Medical College in researching the relationship between umbilical cord blood and maternal and infant blood. When this problem is solved, we can have a better understanding of the distribution of different blood types between mother and child or father and child.</p>
<p>Historical Talk</p>
<h3>Xie Zhi</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yu</p>
<p>(New Interpretations of Master Ai, Part Six)</p>
<p>Our country has many legendary monsters, such as the Bo Yi, the Yang, the nine-tailed fox, the four-eared beast, the eye on the back; the Ya Yu, like a horse, naked with a human face and horse feet; the Fu Xi, like a rooster, with a human face; the Suan Yu, like a snake, with four wings and six eyes, and three legs; the Jian Guo, with one body and nine heads, nine tails, and bristling fur… If they were still alive, we would probably be too scared to go out. The Xie Zhi described in this article is one of them.</p>
<p>The Xie Zhi is similar in shape to a monster called the Qilin, except that it has a hard and sharp horn on its head. Those who have seen ancient dramas know that the animal painted on the walls of government offices and embroidered in the center of officials' robes is the Xie Zhi. What is the origin of this? Listen on…</p>
<p>One day, King Xuan of Qi asked Master Ai, "Haven't we often heard of this strange beast called the Xie Zhi? What exactly is it?"</p>
<p>Master Ai thought that King Qi had other intentions, so he hesitated and said, "Your humble servant… does not know."</p>
<p>"Oh," King Qi said, "I'm just asking! Ai Qing, you are a smart and knowledgeable person, you must know. Hmm, are there any Xie Zhi now?"</p>
<p>When Master Ai saw that King Qi's expression was normal, he replied, "There were Xie Zhi in the time of Yao, but they have all been killed now. Your servant has read in ancient books that Emperor Yao's court must have kept a Xie Zhi. This creature was very strange. It knew who among the officials had evil intentions, greed, or a black heart, and it would use the horn on its head to kill that person and eat him on the spot, without fail."</p>
<p>"So it is the son of the god of justice? It is a pity that they have all been killed!" King Qi nodded.</p>
<p>"Yes! If we kept a Xie Zhi now, it wouldn't be as hungry as it was in Yao's time. It would probably be so full that it wouldn't even need Your Majesty to buy fodder for it." Master Ai laughed, and King Qi also laughed.</p>
<p>Xie Zhi, noble Xie Zhi, when will you be resurrected?</p>

<h3>Wake-Up Telegram</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>Not long ago, Western Union in the United States launched a novel service - the wake-up telegram. For people who like to sleep late in the morning, Western Union has finally come up with this method. The procedure is to specify a time and have a messenger deliver a telegram in the early morning. Friends who sleep late will wake up immediately when they hear that a telegram has arrived, if they did not already know about this wonderful plan. Even if they later learn the secret, the telegraph office has also thought of a plan. The bureau will send "wake-up telegrams" every fifteen minutes, one after another, which will eventually annoy those "sleepyheads" so much that they will no longer want to go back to bed.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the purpose of the "wake-up telegram" is indeed very good. Moreover, the method is so simple. Here, I sincerely hope with all my heart that this business will soon be extended to China, especially to several major cities such as Shanghai, so that those friends who "don't want to get up early" can also appreciate the beauty of the early morning and realize the value of time.</p>
<h3>Poverty and Shame</h3>
<p>— Yi Wu</p>
<p>Poor people should not be ashamed of being poor, because poverty is not an evil thing.</p>
<p>If a person does an evil deed, or even a slightly evil deed, his heart will feel uneasy; he will feel sorry for others, and even more sorry for himself. A pure heart will feel that there is a stain on it. Only then should he be ashamed.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a person does not do evil, but is simply ashamed of being poor, it is meaningless and incorrect. Only doing evil is worth feeling ashamed of.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Qingou</p>
<p>Twelve Unexpected Storms</p>
<p>"Brother, we have been old neighbors for many years. I hope you can be generous!" Old Manager Meng said in a pitiful manner, "The previous things were really all the fault of my harmful uncle. Please forgive me for the sake of our brotherhood! Tomorrow, I will definitely go to Beijing to find him. In a month at most, and twenty days at the least, I will definitely bring Miss Mei Bao back."</p>
<p>When Old Meng said this, Qiu Haitang almost laughed out loud.</p>
<p>"But, Brother Wu," he said, his expression becoming more and more sincere. "Please, please help me to find Lin Sheng back too! I dare not ask you to find him back before I leave, maybe you still can't believe me; but I hope you can get him back in three or four days, first because I only have one son, and I can't be without support when I get old, and second, once I leave tomorrow, there will be no one to take care of the house, so I really can't delay any longer!"</p>
<p>This move was of course anticipated by Yu Kun, but he didn't expect Old Meng to wake up so quickly.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much, Old Man Meng!" Qiu Haitang also hurriedly cupped his hands at him and said, "Your kindness is truly appreciated. I will entrust my daughter's matter to you! Since you are helping me so much, how can I refuse the young manager's matter? But..." (226) "Madam, please do a good deed: my child is dying of illness!"</p>

<h3>Watching Su Shaoqing Perform "Hongyang Cave"</h3>
<p>— Fan Shi Ren</p>
<p>The China Charity Relief Association invited famous amateur performers from Shanghai to perform at the Lyceum Theatre one day to raise funds. The famous Pingju opera artist Su Shaoqing was invited to participate in the main play. Although this man is a veteran in the amateur opera world, he has rarely been seen on stage in recent years. This time, he was said to have agreed to come because he could not refuse the righteous cause, and he met us on the red carpet with his well-studied Tan School's famous play "Hongyang Cave".</p>
<p>The reporter braved the rain to go there at around 9 o'clock, and saw that the usually desolate Lyceum Theatre was suddenly crowded with cars and horses, an unprecedented scene. At that time, the stage was showing a banquet of courtiers, with Zhang Zhixiang playing Mi Heng, singing and reciting flawlessly. After that, it was Huang Jingbo's daughter being escorted. Because the play was too crowded that day, although he tried his best to move forward, Su's play did not appear on the stage until 10:45 amidst the anticipation of the audience, who responded with warm applause, and then immediately held their breath to listen to this high mountain and flowing water music. Every sentence and every word of Su's singing could be heard clearly. If his mouth skills were not top-notch, how could he achieve this? Su's singing and pronunciation have been refined, and in recent years, he has entered a state of perfection. He is not only round and steady, but also good at using the four tones without being restricted by them, which hinders the melody. This point is admirable. As for the clear and elegant voice, it can indeed give people an aesthetic feeling in hearing. In summary, from the beginning of stealing the bones to the end of the illness, the entire play was not sloppy at all, and he tightly grasped the emotions of the characters in the play from beginning to end, which was convincing. The large section of Erhuang Sanyan when he saw the Wise King was sung in a sad and mournful tone, as if weeping and complaining, making people's noses tingle. I am afraid that the old Tan of the year did not sing this any better.</p>
<p>The big-faced Meng Liang who played with Su was the famous Jing amateur Zhang Zhesheng, whose voice was as loud as a bell and whose structure was stable. He is indeed a Jin Shaoshan in the amateur world. The person who played the Qin for Su was the famous Qin amateur Jin Shaogang. Some people have praised Jin as the number one rising star in playing Lao Sheng Jinghu in Shanghai's amateur opera world in recent years, which is no accident. With such skill, it is no wonder that Su relies on him as a green leaf to set off the peony.</p>
<h3>About "The Gold Rush"</h3>
<p>— Gu Sheng</p>
<p>"The Gold Rush," performed by the Tianfeng Drama Society, is a new type of comedy. The reporter was pleased to read the script of the play first, and is pleased to report to the readers first:</p>
<p>Comedy is not easy to create, and comedy is even more difficult. First, it must give a strong satire and portrayal of the existing ridiculous reality, and find its type, and then appropriately emphasize and exaggerate these types to make people laugh, but in addition to laughter, there is still a deep thought, which we can find in Chaplin's "Modern Times" and "City Lights", and we can also see it in "The Gold Rush". It uses a simple story as an introduction, on the one hand, it depicts the ridiculous, pitiful and hateful speculators, hoarders, troublemakers and small businessmen who fuel the flames as the warp, and on the other hand, it portrays the fashion, hypocrisy and deception of Shanghai people as the weft, thus unfolding a series of jokes.</p>
<p>I met several familiar characters in this play, so there is no need to complain about the author, but the cruel reality should be blamed. It made the characters in the play appear on stage, let everyone laugh and open their appetite and eat three more bowls of rice (unfortunately the price of rice is too expensive), which is good for health. Let's take a look at these characters in the play, here are the villagers who came to the city, the antique gentry Mr. Ma Jinshi, who always says "zhizhu zheye", because he heard that Shanghai is full of gold, so he came to Shanghai to "dig gold". There is also the treasure of our ancient China, a country squire whose eyes are full of Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi, and whose mouth is full of young masters and young ladies. There is also a Shanghai young master, a fashionable lady, a cheater, and a gambler. The reporter thinks that we have shed too many tears in our time, and now we need laughter, we need strong laughter, from laughter we can gain the power of rebirth.</p>
<h3>"Home" Movie Story (8)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yibai</p>
<p>Not long after the death of Master Gao, Gao Keming and other elder brothers quarreled and divided the family. Seeing that this large family was on the verge of collapse, Juewei had the intention of seeking other development. At this time, Juewei's wife, Li Ruijue, was pregnant and about to give birth, and Master Gao's concubine, Aunt Chen, thought that Master Gao's coffin was still in the house, and no one could give birth, saying that it would make the dead uneasy in the afterlife. So she forced Juewei to find another house for Ruijue to live in. Although Juewei knew that this was a ridiculous superstition, he had no way to resist, so he had to patiently discuss with Ruijue and find another small house outside the city to move Ruijue to. Although Ruijue was very unwilling, she had to submit to her husband's weakness and incompetence. And Aunt Chen thought that Juewei was in mourning and should not meet with the parturient. Therefore, when Ruijue was about to give birth, the servant girl accompanying her also blocked Juewei outside the door, not allowing them to meet. As a result, Ruijue, due to internal and external attacks, died of blood loss after the baby was born.</p>
<p>At this time, the once-powerful Gao family had fallen apart and disintegrated. Seeing this dilapidated scene, Juewei could no longer bear it, so he had to abandon this large family that had lived together for generations and seek other development elsewhere.</p>
<p>At the moment when Juewei boarded the boat to leave, Juemin and Yunhua came to see him off. Yunhua said: "Soon, we will follow in your footsteps and go to other places." (The End)</p>

<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: In a fit of anger for beauty</p>
<p>Zhang Cangbai was very depressed, so he ran to the Right Army camp with Chen Fei to meet Xu Jing and Liu Yinying. They went out of the camp and sat on the ground in a pine forest under a hillside to talk. Zhang Cangqiu said to Xu Jing, "Brother Xu, I have been feeling bloated these days, I can't eat, and I can't wait to fly to Beijing, cut Li Chuang in half with one knife, and quell the chaos for the country. I don't know what medicine General Wu is selling in his gourd by stationing his troops here without moving. The day before yesterday, I had already asked Defender Ma Bao to urge General Wu to quickly kill to Beijing to avenge the emperor. But the news is silent and has always been stagnant here, how can it not be depressing? General Wu was originally ordered to deploy troops to the pass to guard the capital. Now that the capital has been lost, he is watching and not moving forward. Is it because Emperor Chongzhen is dead and the Ming Dynasty is considered dead? How can we soldiers stand by and watch and not have the heart to save? So I came to visit you, let's discuss and discuss; should we go to see General Wu in person and urge him to march quickly? If he doesn't go, I, Lao Zhang, will kill to Beijing alone. Brother Xu, isn't it? "Xu Jing listened and clapped his hands and praised," Brother Zhang said it so straightforwardly! We will kill the thieves with one heart, and we will not hesitate. But in my opinion, General Wu's heart is a little shaken. I don't know why he didn't continue to set off immediately? This morning, I heard people say that General Wu's father, Wu Xiang, had sent a letter. General Wu kept it secret and sent people to Beijing to inquire about the news. A person cannot be known, maybe General Wu's heart is a little shaken." (183)</p>
