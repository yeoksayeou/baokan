<p>莫斯科　日外相松岡在赴柏林途次、昨日午後抵此、凡加入軸心公約各國之外交人員、都到車站迎迓、因前兩日來風雪甚厲、致松岡抵此遲延兩小時、德大使舒侖堡到站較遲、操英語向松岡道歉、松岡今日將拜訪蘇外長莫洛托夫、而定今夜啟程赴柏林與羅馬、此間日方人士預料、松岡可於四月十六日取道莫斯科返日、松岡接見外籍記者時稱、若不親議德·義領袖、則日本整個外交政策之進行、或有差異、各國之政策、固終將取決於其基本利益、但和戰問題有時可以面晤決定之云、松岡普追述去年九月三國公約簽字後、渠曾接德外長里賓特羅甫之電話、邀渠往遊軸心國京城、八年前渠曾與羅索里尼長談、並在上海旺義外相齊亞諾、但與德國領袖無一面之緣、松岡又稱、日本之外交政策、將以三國公約為樞紐、繞之而行、渠身為外相、曾對公約之締結助以一臂之力者、今訪晤德國領袖用自然之事、此行或有新自觀察西歐局勢、尤其是現正進行的戰爭之機緣、渠此行並未規定期限、但不欲離日本逾六星期、渠抵莫斯科、備受禮待、歸途中欲在莫斯科駐足、以晤蘇聯領袖、　所定程序中、未包括巡　西歐情形、（二十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　日外相松岡昨夜向記者稱、渠遊德·義之後、不擬前往倫敦或華盛頓、但願於歸程時、在莫斯科作數日勾留、（二十四日海通社電）</p>
<p>維希　外交界觀察家稱、日外相松岡本日方晤蘇外長莫洛托夫之舉、乃係一種酬酢、須待重返莫斯科時、雙方始得進行長時間談話、緣渠此行、乃以聘德為主要目標、蘇·日問題、僅當在其返國途中、加以討論、顧此一問題、對於日本亦殊關係重大、蓋因日本能否南進、悉視此一問題如何解決以為斷也、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>華方注視　松岡活動</h3>
<p>重慶　此間華方人士、對於日外相松岡在莫斯科及柏林之活動、雖繼續加以密切注意、但關於松岡此行、此間似甚少切實消息、若干方面認松岡係先與莫斯科及柏林完成初步談判、然後成行、及此行之結果將簽訂若干具體之協定、另有一部份人士、則以松岡此次前往莫斯科及柏林、對於遠東局勢並未携有任何切實之解決方案、而實係覓取某項解決、皆特別重視、認為松岡將乘留　期間致力於斷定德國在歐勝利所造成之機會、究竟何若、俾可決定日本日後應採之途徑、衆意松岡將與希特勒討論美國可能積極參戰之問題、及其對於德日地位之影響、衆信松岡或將勸誘希特勒壓迫重慶與日議和、及請求希特勒令莫斯科停止蘇聯對華之援助、（二十四日路透社電）</p>

<p>檢視上海：上海對人類文明，對中華國族，罪狀可謂罄竹難書，然而此僅上海之一面觀而已：中外人文由此溝通，中外商貨由此吞吐，由此溝通吞吐，直接間接貢獻於此一世紀者，事功亦自不容抹煞：而最近三年半，四周烈燄，獨成孤島，居民托命於斯者五百萬，資產保全於斯者數十萬萬，唯人唯物，上海有其存在之價値，不可辯也，洵作激越之談，豈難執一而論。如謂上海形成孤島之後，人力物資，對於抗建偉業無大貢獻，中央政令難行，而外匯與其他一般消耗允爲國力漏巵，誠贅疣也，此是一說。如謂上海托庇國際力量，遇事掣肘，有妨控制，以致征略事功莫由貫澈，誠障礙也，此又一說。如謂上海竟至腐蝕一般人類社會所必備之綱紀與道德，故詐欺壟斷煙賭殘殺等等罪惡，皆得恣肆，誠魔窟也，此又一說。如謂上海與內地交通梗阻，既喪其地利上之優勢，不復爲貿易上之樞紐，無事可圖，無商可營，開埠百年，茲頻末日，誠廢墟也，此又一說。凡此諸說，觀點逈殊，幾可獲得同一之結論曰，棄之耳，毀之耳，舉無足恤。顧乃默察情勢，不僅抱殘守缺，奉法安分，眞能愛惜上海如吾儕者不願棄上海，毀上海，亦不忍見其被棄被毀而已；過猶不及，非常重之非常愛之，於是而非常爭之。嗚呼，詎知爭之即所以毀之耶！</p>
<p>時在距今兩年前之三月中旬，上海租界杌隍，有朝夕不保之觀；本報論之，嘗謂「誰願毀上海，竊以爲莫願毀之；誰能毀上海，竊以爲莫不能毀之。惟莫願毀，故雖迭經憂患，卒以各方之相忍，有如今日之瓦全。不相忍，必瓦解；杌隍不安者，殆爲瓦解之朕兆；雖然，此乃各方之始願乎？願毀上海，毀之至易；始願不若是，則望各方勇於反省，善自檢討」。當時不安之因素，異於今茲；然當時所論，則迄今猶此情理，抑且永久必若此情理也。何也，瓦全由相忍，相忍由各有所恤，若乃無所愛惜於上海，則此蕞爾彈丸之區，夷爲平地，易如反掌耳，孰得而保全之。請歛劍拔弩張之姿，請作平心靜氣之想，情理不若是耶，事與勢不若是耶！</p>
<p>或吾認爲爭爲毀。誠以上海不可爭。上海之爲上海，由上海之複雜性；爭之而消長，化複雜爲純一，則上海雖未平地，亦因變質變態而不復保持其爲非常可重，非常可愛之上海矣。不但不可爭，亦不必爭。上海之爲上海，絕無獨立性而惟視大環境；環境安則上海安，環境危則上海危，環境黑則黑，環境白則白；今日之上海，以世界全局爲所由轉移之環境。上海不毀，則世界局勢將主宰上海之前進；亦無論上海毀或不毀，絕對不足以決定世界局勢，絕對不足以變更所處之環境。故曰上海不必爭。爲上海而爭，則所爭應在上海之外，上海之上。爭於上海，則無論所爭爲控制，所爭爲榮辱，所爭爲意氣恩怨，爭於上海必毀上海！</p>
<p>吾人愛惜上海，哀上海，爰爲上海呼籲，不願毀上海者其韙之乎！</p>

<h3>國際軼事（十）（二）　美國備戰四巨頭</h3>
<p>美國這决空前的擴充武備計劃，是由一個大規模製造家，一個勞工領袖，一個報紙出版人，和一個律師兼政治家所指導。這四大巨頭之中，一個就是通用汽車公司前總經理納遜，現任國防顧問委員會主席兼軍備製造部主任，一個是美國成衣業聯合會主席希爾門，現仟國防顧問委員會副主席兼勞工部主任，一個是芝加哥日報出版人諾克斯上校，現任海軍部長，還有一個是前在紐的擔任律師後爲國務卿的史汀生上校，現任陸軍部長。他們都須襄助羅斯福總統，分攬憲法，和國會所授予的權力。</p>
<p>這四個人物，來歷不同，却都不是民主黨員。諾克斯和史汀生隸屬共和黨。希爾閂和納遜旣無黨派關係，且都不是美國人，納遜原籍丹麥，希爾門原籍立陶宛，都是在二十歲的時候，移殖美國的。</p>
<p>納遜在一般人心目中，是個傑出的大批製造家，曾辭去通用汽車公司年薪三十萬零三千四百美元的經理職位，（係美國十個俸給最大者之一，按其年薪計算，平均每日薪金爲八百三十美元），來幹這不取一文的國防委員，自非等閑可比。他現年五十八歲，初來美國時，曾在福特汽車公司任事，旋成爲「汽車大王」福特手下惟一紅人。他在一九二二年改就歇弗萊汽車公司副經理，至一九三七年，仟通用汽車公司總經理，直至爲羅斯福總統所物色。此人身長六呎，銀髮　飄，帶一副拖着黑緞帶的夾鼻眼鏡，平時健步如飛，不喜高談闊論。</p>
<p>希爾門身材魁梧，鼻架眼鏡，頭髮烏黑，現年五十三歲，是生在立陶宛的猶太人。自一九一五年起，他當選爲成衣業聯合會主席，以善於處理該業勞工問題著名，他並且在工業組織委員會草創時，即任副主席，直至去年十一月，纔因羅斯福三任總統問題，和工業組織委員會主席劉易士意見不合。劉易士宜佈擁護共和黨總統候選人威爾基競選的時候，他就不再和他台作了。</p>
<p>諾克斯上校，現年六十六歲，生於波十頓，原爲芝加哥日報的發行人。他在美國與西班牙戰爭時，不過是一名小卒，旋業新聞記者，後來竟一躍而爲赫斯特系報紙的總經理。他曾在一九三六年擔任共和黨副總統候選人，並曾於一九三八年著書，批評羅斯福總統的「新政」，但當歐戰局勢日益惡化的時候，即竭力主張援助英國。他自上次歐戰以來，保持後備上校的頭銜，是中等身材，一頭沙髮，痛惡官塲惡習，辦事大刀闊斧。</p>
<p>史汀生上校，軀幹高偉，沉默寡言，年已七十有三，原是紐的著名律師。他會在塔虎晚總統時代任陸軍部長，柯立芝總統時代任非律濱總督，並在胡佛總統時代任國務卿。他的政治主張以堅決反對日本擴充勢力著稱，所著「遠東危局」一書，頗有大政治家獨到之見。</p>

<p>英美絕未　表示讓步</p>
<p>據外人方面消息、各方自聞工部局通吿、將工部局工董選舉日期星期一週後、為本市選舉史上最富有決定性之時期、日僑在此七日內、或能於會議折衝中、以達其過去一再失敗之目的、無須投票、而增加日董之名額、因英美集團或將以一二席次、讓予日方、而其他國籍之僑民、或亦可乘機在工部局董事會中獲得一席地、但　美著名僑商對大中社記者表示、為決心維護各該國權益起見、渠等絕未作讓步想、故上述妥協之說、尚不能證實、</p>
<p>談判範圍　相當廣泛</p>
<p>據可靠方面傳出消息稱、有關方面目下所進行之談判範圍、較一般預想者為大、本市各關侮國領署當局、為避免由於本屆工部局競選引起各國僑民之緊張情緖、致重演二月份在納稅人召開特別大會時所演出之開槍、及暴動事件、故對於目下之董事分配問題、慎重予以攷慮、期能覓得能為雙方可接受之辦法、上述種種辦法、皆須於四月一日以前商定及解決、國各國僑民團體工董候選人、須於該日中午以前、向工部局提出也、</p>
<p>期望上海　成一樂土</p>
<p>據樂、有關當局此舉之目的、為使上海能成為戰爭世界中之樂土、英美方面、日方及軸心國代表、皆不願此間從此多事、為避免發生糾紛計、在工部局佔優勢之英美人、準備對日本作若干「公平」之讓步、然逾此限度、則無法妥協、目下癥結所在、為雙方對於「何者為公平」、「何者不合理」、尚不能獲得一致意見、據聞日方以競選必失敗、久有彎頭此問題之意見、雙方若能妥協、則日方能在工部局中、能得更多之董事席、</p>
<p>各國僑民　共同合作</p>
<p>目下談判、其範圍尚不專限於日董問題、據可靠方面傳出之消息稱、談判若成功、則人數衆多之德國僑民、或將得一董　席、或一董事、聞有關當局過去曾草擬公平之董事分配計劃、工部局副總辦納許離滬時、亦曾發表一文稱、日方若能提供某種保證、並在其區域內作某種改革、則應將日方在工部局之權力擴大、目下之談判、其範圍究廣大至如何程度、目下尚無法獲悉、惟某官員稱、談判範圍「尚大」、上文所提及之二計劃、談判時曾否提及、則不久有所表示、又稱上海為一國際都市、為全市利益計、市政問題、應於會議席中解決、</p>

<p>復工原議</p>
<p>自二十一日勞方復工失敗後、法捕房政事部即暫停調解、但終以關係界內治安重大、未便棄置、故二十三日雖為星期、仍照常辦公、並於是日下午四時、召集勞方代表舉行會談、對解決工潮之途徑、作坦白之探討、並多聽勸諭、勞方於表示對復工頗具誠意後、政事部當向勞方提出保證、　米貼增加最低可自十八元至二十五元、津貼增加十元、　罷工期內工資照給、　被捕工人允予釋放、勞方當即表示服從、即與該部成立妥協、並允於次日（昨日）開始復工、談判至晚八時始行完畢、</p>
<p>功敗垂成</p>
<p>當晚勞方即分遣人員通知工友、囑於明日（即二十四日）一律復工、昨晨七時三十分、全體工人即自南市出發、前往呂班路廠址、斯時資方已將鐵綱除去、大門啟開、二千工人即魚貫入內、發電馬達亦開動、僅待資方將被捕銅匠倪阿貓釋出後、車輛即可駛出復工、但捕房仍未釋放被捕工人、勞方認為與前日妥協之點衝突、表示拒絕、資方亦堅持其意見、遂致復工工人、仍將馬達關閉、全體集合、廢然而散、復工一幕、又吿幻滅、</p>
<p>雙方堅持　記者昨訪法捕房政事部、據稱、雙方各自固執意見、致本部數次努力、均功敗垂成、實堪惋惜、現聞該部對調解工作、又吿停頓矣、記者旋復往訪法商水電公司當局、彼等對復工之見解、不願有所表明、並暗示目下燃料困難、亦不急於復工、並稱、昨日對工人要求答復之日期、但勞方代表、並未前來、工潮逾陷僵化、</p>
<p>工人開會　昨日法捕房方面承認已逮捕法電工人一名、將於日內解法租界法院訴以煽動工潮罪、至全體工人對於此事、頗表不滿、仍堅持非釋放被捕工友、決不復工、幷定於今日下午、在南市大吉路公共體育塲舉行緊急會議、商討對策、據一般觀察、該項工潮、尚無於短期內解決之望、斜橋鐵門、原為三扇齊開者、昨日下午三時、其中二扇均為鎖閉、僅餘一扇進出、南市至租界之行人車輛、均須經嚴密之搜査後、方得通過、</p>
<h3>比大使　前日抵滬</h3>
<p>比國駐華大使紀佑穆、自去歲十二月中旬離滬赴平後、條已數月、茲以急欲赴渝作公私上之拜訪、便道來滬視察館務、已於前日（二十三日）乘日本大運汽船株式會社靑島丸由平來滬、於上午十時許抵埠、即偕使館歡迎人員、分乘汽車直赴蒲石路Cathay　Mansions公寓休息、大使此次係隻身來滬、尚有秘書二人、先一日已由平直赴重慶、預為佈置官邸、以便大使赴渝後駐節之所、聞大使在滬、將與親友稍作三四日之酬酢、卽離滬赴港轉渝、拜會中樞各要人、在渝公畢、再當轉道來滬、作較久之居留、</p>
<h3>交通銀行　被綁兩人</h3>
<p>滬西越界築路區極司非而路三義坊十三號、為交通銀行職員宿舍、忽於前日深晚十一時許、被武裝人員闖入、綁去該行南京路支行職員梁殿湘（廣東人）、信託部職員張鄰者（蘇州人）二名、坊內所居該行職員聞訊之後、莫不驚惶失措、相率避去</p>
<h3>西貢港米糧　已准運滬</h3>
<p>租界當局鑒於米價頻漲、有碍界內治安、衆以欲穩定民食、首須懲辦米　、及疏通來源、增厚存底、自經積極設法疏通洋米來源後、茲已獲有端倪、除將裝米船隻洽妥外、並西貢·　羅·仰光·香港等地政府、亦均已電復到滬、准放運大宗洋米來滬調劑、凡滬商在該地採辦米糧將予以便利、茲悉當局已分別知照米商、尅日同外洋產米區大量採辦、俾運滬調劑、而裕民食存底、昨日米市、投機份子雖欲乘金價變動而企圖抬高價格、但終因連日來源湧旺、囤戶已有拋售、而吿微漲、預計當局抑平米價辦法公佈後、價格當可更趨下跌、</p>
<h3>蘇北迭有戰事　大批郵件退回</h3>
<p>蘇北各地如泰興·黃橋·香港·姜堰·天興港一帶、邇來迭有激烈之流動戰事發生、上海郵局昨收到由該地退回郵件一大批、均由當地郵局、加蓋「該地戰事情形特殊無法投　」</p>

<h3>我想着三三四（續）</h3>
<p>— 邱希福</p>
<p>離園門口一半所在，一個俄　邁婦，牽着一個年主三四齡的小孩子，大家一拐一拐的走着。忽然那小孩子要獨自一人走着玩，於是老婦便把帶來的一柄小鐵鏟授給他——不是孫兒，便是外孫——這孩子拿了小鐵鏟，便在地上亂掘亂挖。我想這孩子長大起來，一定又是一位赤手成人業的異國英雄。「給他們一柄鐵鏟到中國去創業」，我腦中立刻獲得這一個敎育標語哩！</p>
<p>並不是眼花，在靠近園門口對着黃浦江的一隻凳子上，又發現了那提大皮包的猶太人。所奇怪的，他又在和另一個女人談笑。</p>
<p>穿過外灘電車路，在大馬路匯中飯店的角子上，看見一個出售風景片的猶太人，向我招呼。他所出售的，有一元八張的彩色畫片，二角半和四角錢一張的上海風景照片。我化了四毛錢買了一張「外灘全景」——見本文揷圖——靠右面原來還有一個和平神像，現在已截去了。</p>
<p>我問他：「你來滬幾久了？」</p>
<p>他道：「從維也納來滬，已有兩年了。」他分明是個被逐者。</p>
<p>「靠出　風景片就能過活嗎？」</p>
<p>他就對我說道，要是天不下雨，而又不十分冷的話，每天做上一兩元的買賣，倒還能敷衍過去。當他說到「天冷」兩字時，他不甚純熟的英語，已無法加强他的語意，索性把他兩隻手舉起來給我看，一面形容出寒風砭骨時瑟肅苦惱的樣子。我看見他身上所穿的是一件雨衣，在太陽光之下竟也辨別不出質料和顏色，好像是棕黃灰三種天然色所組成。</p>
<p>「你一天生活所需要化上多少錢？」</p>
<p>「我住在虹口，房金每月十六元。吃飯隨便得很，向毛錢一頓。」</p>
<p>「什麽時候生意最好？」</p>
<p>他面上頓時一亮，把手指着黃浦江，又抬頭來看看對面的華懋飯店。然後說道：「外洋有輪船到埠時，旅客們便是我最好的主顧。」</p>
<p>他忽然問我道：「你能講德文麽？」我說我不會。當他說明了問我的原因之後，我也一笑置之。</p>
<p>最後他吿訴後，他名叫愛絲納（Egon　Eisner）並謝謝我惠顧的盛意。</p>
<p>隔着愛絲納所靠着的一座墻，便是匯中飯店的茶室，靠窗的幾個座位上，都已坐滿了人在那裏啜茗。湖綠色的檯布，富麗的白銀茶壺，糖缸，烟灰盤等，在馬路上走的人，都能很淸楚的看到。還有一陣陣音韻幽揚的調子，從窗隙中透出來。直走到南京路　十五號隔壁，一家花鋪前面，耳朶裏　覺得聽不到音樂了。抬頭看見這家花鋪的招牌下面有一行英文字道：「Rose　Lane——玫瑰巷。」</p>
<p>心中想着的是：</p>
<p>三毛錢一杯紅茶；</p>
<p>三毛錢一條巧克力糖；</p>
<p>四毛錢一張風景照片。</p>

<h3>糧食　洋米昨市先漲後落</h3>
<p>塲外洋米咋日晨漲午平、下午銳落、蓋大戶以金漲匯縮爲理由又在居奇、（實則金跌滙長、米價亦不至見鬆）、店銷因上日停市、頗有動辦、浮囤活動、續上升二三元、齣經一提、實銷縮手、且浮戶見有餘利、亦紛紛乘高出籠、客囤更將大批現貨推銷、漲風遂挫、一反早市初態、立轉下游、結果各實貼盤、若白身小紋自初一躍開四千一百元、卒復回至三千九百元、中關自三千八九百元回至三千六七百兀、二號西貢自三千七百元、回至三千五百元、一號西貢高貨自三千四百元回　三千二三百元、决自三千二百元復至三千一百元、三千元、僅一號暹羅及火絞、去路較淡殊鮮變化、始終貼三千四五百元、碎尖則自二千二百元回至三千元、二千八九百元、統計先後一起一伏、但西貢等下午均抑低四五百元、尙乏受主、故早市雖見漲起　四兀、而晚收反比週六小三四元、全日成交則有二萬多包、</p>
<p>洋米大量不斷到埠、連日到滬、迭誌本報、怡和洋行日陞輪前日（二十三日）抵埠、由香港裝來一萬二千五百六十四包、停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、太古公司安微輪咋午到滬、亦由香港運來一萬五千三百十六包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、前日本報所載麵粉二千包運烟台、係「苞米」、誤刊「麵粉」、並此更正、（祖）</p>

<p>糯米另躉夫路、亦因甩低並見活絡、所以懷貨者相繼扳俏、喊聲迭起、市面堅緊異常、結果香港特別團粒開百十兀、大市貨百另八元至百另六元、至若糯茶特別者竟亦開遠一百元另五角、一百元、大市九十八元决至碎九十元、計猛漲三元有奇、</p>
<h3>粉市仍在居奇</h3>
<p>粉市先漲後平、開市漲風頗烈、因週六謠諑忽起、在金貴匯縮聲中、本客實銷與囤戶趁機吸收，執貨者藉口居奇、花烏鐘樓牌澳粉又躍至三十元〇三四角、金龍牌坎粉二十九元五六角惟下午忽傳大批坎粉、業已進口、及米價　漲後回、實銷　時呆滯、花烏牌回至二十九兀八角、金龍牌亦低三四角、統市成交一萬餘包、市面情勢、漸人醞釀之態、當以到貨是吾證實爲轉移云、</p>
<p>小麥市況、仍告呆靜、內地到貨久稀、市場供給寥落、堪稱有市無貨、目下高杜麥價在四十五兀左右、因粉市趨堅、局勢帶穩、</p>
<p>洋麵粉續有到滬、咋日太古公司安徽輪抵埠、除由港運來大批洋米外、另有麵粉一千包、怡和洋行日陞輪、前日（二十三日）到滬、亦裝來大批洋麵粉一萬八千九百六十四包、（祖）</p>
<h3>油市　豆油稍廉　又見暴漲　惟囤戶虎狼成性</h3>
<p>邇來豆油市面、較爲平定、每斤一元有零、而生油一元、只買十二兩、現下生活艱難、不無擇廉而取、世上只有囤戶、虎狼成性、殺人不怕血腥氣、故又向豆油進攻、市塲中買氣熾盛、一般投機份子，父現活躍在態、行情因之直上、結東現貨暴漲六元、期貨猛升五元、廠油昂砌二元之外、花生油尙少變遷、統計做開大有廠油三百担、提至一百元、大連油二　桶、價爲一百三十三元至一百三十五元、叉訂四月上交六百五十桶、價自一百三十元七角半、直相差一百三十六元七角半、又訂四月下交一千餘桶、價爲一百三十五元七角半至一百三十八元五角、花生油成交江北本坊聽裝四千聽、價爲一百五十二元、烟台聽油二百聽、價爲一百五—六元、及烟台套裝油五十件、價爲一百十四元、</p>

<h3>證券　統丁獨荷注意　—外股一漲即落—</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市況極為混沌、論人心仍係看好、但以本埠事態、令人不快、是以逢高即賣、頗不易支撑、在此恍惚時代、人心不寗、當以鎭定少做爲妙、倘遭意外損失、殊屬小値、本雄事件、當係局部問題、斷不致引起意外糾紛、故公債尙屬安定耳、昨日交易、上午信孚又有買進、問康鴻大大通和豐德隆等均有買進、聯和恒康胡鶴記樂茂等均有賣出、初開、丙種曾進六元關、入後步步上騰、仍穿出六元關、而以六元五角收盤、行市頗望、午後信孚仍有吃胃、而對丁種特別注意、收進不少，餘如同康聯益進胃亦不弱、丙種開盤再漲一二角、嗣以仁豐胡鶴記教餘紛紛賣出、而聯益出乙丁兩種頗多、行市乃又轉下游、丁種因信孚按住、結果比上週尙漲起六角之多、其他各種均回小二角左右、獨甲種小去五角半爲最吃虧、成交總數的一百二十萬元、茲列簡明表各於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交交通銀行股一百股、價為八元一元正、華商電氣股、喊價八元一角半、買不進、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤堅俏、嗣即逐步回落、會德豐開盤一百零四元、收盤一百零二元、英聯由三十元跌至二十八元七五、怡和由四十五元七五跌至四十五元祥、泰木行獨吿上漲、上午成交價爲五十二元半至五十三元、下午突騰達至五十六元收盤、橡皮股被忽視、價亦隨實業股下趨、</p>

<h3>紗花　實銷不動　紗市未能直上　同業獨在放空</h3>
<p>紗市先升後平、但趨勢硬中帶軟、此因實際銷塲不旺、所以標金猛騰、及外滙改縮、紗價未能隨之向上、不過滙兌緊縮後、廠方涼料價格高昂、成本提升、因之有一部份囤戶吸收之額、仍不放棄、證券幫由空翻多、惟同業中某某等放空、所以兩方爭持益烈也、二十支雙馬高價爲一千四百三十九元、低價爲一千四百十六元、午後初做一千四百十六兀、旋復升至一千四百二十四元、又回下至一千四百十七元、最後價一千四百三十五元、今日有棉紗五百五十五件運暹　、又一百六十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、人氣熱烈、首盤價一千四百二十元，少頃跌至一千四百十七元、未幾聞標金開盤在跳二百元、於是市塲買風頓熾、叫買者振動、立刻升至一千四百三十九元、惟有一部份盈利者吐出、同時金市回小、市象趨鬆、跌至一千四百二十一元、此盤父復回好至一千四百三十元、不過　塲不暢、父回下至一千四百十八元收盤、查半日間成交統計七千四百五十似、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<h3>棉銷熱鬧　印棉由港轉來</h3>
<p>現棉情况尙昂、因外匯趨縮、人心良好、但實際交易、並未十分發展也、惟同業買賣、允爲熱鬧、昨日共成交二千〇六十四件、價大一二元、茲錄現棉行市如左、</p>
<p>紐約棉市平靜、而有參次、至收盤時、突因南方幫售出而跌、結果較之上日收盤價格、低落的三四磅音、</p>

<p>又孟買電、去年九月一日起、至今年三月二十二日止、印棉</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、盛况又一見熱鬧、廠方速日皆有購進、而同時同業互做販買、更爲活躍、預料因外匯緊縮、純金猛漲、且紗市亦步趨漲勢、故今後數日將有角逐的形勢展開也、</p>
<p>印度棉花每年輸入中國、爲數至鉅、大多數由英商輸自孟買或喀爾喀搭裝來、近因歐洲戰事關係、行駛遠東綫英輪减少、尙有少數央輪行駛、亦以香港爲止、不來上海、故印棉運滬特見减少、惟日商採購者、由日輪源源直接裝運、一部份均運香港、然後轉運來滬、茲悉太古公司南昌輪前日（二十二日）到埠、由香港轉來印棉七千四百三十七件、昨日安徽輪扺滬、亦由香港轉來一千二百零六件、（祖）</p>
<h3>疋頭　布疋實銷呆滯</h3>

<h3>短命的人力車夫</h3>
<p>— 煥鈞</p>
<p>拉人力車是勞工階級中最普遍的職業，單是上海一地已有好幾萬，他們靠着兩腿來維持生活，不論嚴寒盛暑，終日奔走街頭，飽經風霜雨雪的侵襲，可謂勞苦極了。更因飲食，工作，睡眠都沒有定時，而且因爲不知或無暇，所以幾乎絕不講究衛生。往往剛纔吃飽，立即拉車奔跑：甚至有時手中正以大餅果腹，一遇乘客招呼，立將半個大餅急急納入口中，接受生意，拉車飛奔的；其劇烈有害胃腸消化機能，不問可知，實足以促短壽命。所以人力車夫是很少長壽的。</p>
<p>人力車夫不壽的事實，筆者已數見不鮮了，曩昔身居南市時，在里弄口的過街樓下，曾先後借宿過三個人力車夫，而這三人都活不到長壽：第一個只三十幾歲，拉了二年多車，就把生命拉掉了。第二個也只活到四十開外。最後來住的却是一個年靑力壯的漢子，年紀還在三十左右，拉起車來其快如飛，而且爲人戇直，人都以阿戇呼之，當時我以爲像道樣一個强壯的漢子，總不會短命吧，在初見他時，直像一頭蠻牛般有力，可是不出二年，工作逼得他變成一隻偷懶的偎灶貓，拉車時慢得無可再慢，到了第四年上，終因得了烈的腸胃病而喪身。像他這樣一個結實的漢子也只活了三十多歲，眞令人獨目驚。</p>
<p>這是社會上的大慘劇，我們要怎樣去解救他們呢？</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>夜行人</h3>
<p>— 滄子</p>
<p>黎明前的黑暗網罩了大地上的一切，即使那崎嶇不平無數碎石板連續成的青白石路也失去了它的反射作用。夜行人，手裏沒有一盞發紅光　的燈　，走着他無盡頭的征途。黑暗是光明的前哨，夜行人想。黑暗的途中或許還橫架着刺業，斜臥着荊棘，它們會撕碎夜行人的衣服，甚至絆了他一交。當然，夜行人就得拉開荊棘，或翻身而起，繼續向他的無盡征途，他不會存一剎那的『回轉吧』或『坐在這裏等天明再走』的念頭。因爲他知道在黑途中要是有了這個念頭，那還是想「自殺吧」來得乾脆。</p>
<p>什麼事物都得有個途中，並且不會是平坦路途。嬰兒呱呱墮地，就得跟寒，熱，飢饑和病菌搏鬥，及至長大，社會傳統的束縛，生活的桎梏跟他不斷鬥爭。種子落在土中，就得跟禽烏昆蟲相競爭，及至長大，風雨的打擊，霜雪的『煎熬』，使它隨時有死減的機會。所以任何事物的途中不是痛苦的掙扎，便是掙扎的痛苦。一種新勢力的長成，就會過到舊勢力的壓迫和破壞，叛亂者的出賣和阻礙，他的途中就是在攻擊犧牲中形成。</p>
<p>什麼都得有途中，而且這途中是痛苦的。</p>
<p>人類在痛苦的途中分成了三隊：</p>
<p>一隊是受不住痛苦的煎熬而屈膝，一變而爲壓迫者的俘虜和奴隸。</p>
<p>一隊是因痛苦而消極，洋洋的大江將成爲他們的墓地。即使有剩下的，也是『準奴隸」無疑。</p>
<p>一隊是奮鬥者，壓迫不能使他們屈膝，痛苦不會驅他們至消極，祗有奮鬥前進，他們認爲是排除一切困難的惟一法門。</p>
<p>一定的，屈膝就是滅亡，消極是滅亡的叩鬥者。祗有奮鬥的人才是黑暗的戰勝者，光明的主人。</p>
<p>夜行人要從黑暗的途中走向光明的境地，他用奮鬥來做他的武器。但是有人說了：無把握的行動是永在黑暗途中長征，再吸不到光明的養氣。不錯。不過我們的夜行人（就是奮鬥者）有堅決的信心，剛强的意志。這不是他的把握嗎？憑了這，他看淸了每塊碎石板的紋路。不會錯的，前面沒有『此路不通』的牌子。夜行人這樣說。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>迷信的力量</h3>
<p>— 魯漢</p>
<p>我住的地方是一個又像棧房，又像旅館，父像公寓的房子，這裹有烟，有賭，有……更有的是迷信。</p>
<p>這裹的迷信氣息眞是濃厚得很；做功德，做道塲，做佛事，這裏應有盡有，和尙，道士，尼姑，佛婆，這兒長年雇用。這家死了人，做七做八，那家死了人，可可咚咚，從朝到夜，敲得你頭昏腦漲，這些都算不了什麼，更有趣的是什麼事悄都有忌諱，雖然家家戶戶的門上都貼上了『太公在此百無禁忌』的紅紙。動不動就是觸犯了忌諱，觸了霉頭，這裏觸霉頭的人眞多呀，舉個例來說罷，『接方送藥」的把藥送錯了人家，那麼這人家就認爲觸了霉頭，非要送藥的買了香燭來當堂叩頭賠罪不可，花了錢還要叩頭，送藥的是倒了霉了，他家的霉頭也就不觸了。晒衣裳這裏也有一個規矩，女人的褲子是不可以曬什路口的，據說在晒着的女人褲子下走過也是觸霉頭的，這樣可苦了女人，因爲這裹的一個晒臺是只够二房東一家使用的，一個沒有天的天井卻是幾十家人家晒衣裳的好所在。這個天井是走出走進必經之路，因此時常有水會滴到你頭上，女人的褲子旣不能吊在天井裹，父不能吊在僅僅只能放，床一桌的房間裏，今天大概是那一個不識相的女人把自已的褲子吊在天井裏了，不滿五分鐘，不知被那一個對於女人褲子特有研究的人發覺了，不得了，破了案了，駡聲起了，全個棧房都騷擾起來了，褲子被丟掉了。平時和這女人有仇的就不肯放鬆這個絕好的機會，抓住了她的弱點人家叫喊起來，理直氣壯，聲勢洶洶的把那女人駡得狗血噴頭，說也奇怪，平日不算和善的女人今天自知理屈了，把頭躱在屋子裏冉也不敢鑽出來，平心靜氣的聽她們挑戰，再也不敢回駡一聲。可是我倒有些替那女人憤憤不平，受了法律的制裁尙且不服氣要上訴，現在被一個毫無根據的迷信話判了罪，處了刑，却伏伏貼貼俯首屏息的一些不想反抗。呀！傳統的迷信的力量，倒比法律强了。</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>在寂寞裏徘徊</h3>
<p>— 曼修</p>
<p>媽躺在牀上，挨着最優的喘息，媽說：『修，我要死了！你給媽爭氣吧！』我說：『媽，你放心！我一定，一定會給你爭氣的！』媽點點頭，父交代姊姊說：『你是最大的，我死了以後，你好好地看護弟妹吧！』說着，看了爸眼，噙着淚死了！</p>
<p>媽閉着眼，靜靜地死法了！留下我們姊弟三個，條孤島般的凄零！爸說我們年紀太小，爲我們娶了個後母；進鬥那天，我們三個帶羞孝，向新來的母親見禮的時候，姊姊和我都偷偷的哭了！爸看着抱在娘姨手裏的弟弟，也怪難受的；後來，姊姊把爸拉在一旁說：『爸！你別忘了我們的媽啊！』爸答應了！這晚上，我說小淸楚我們是怎樣過的。</p>
<p>從此，我們又有了如了！我們等着『母親』的慈愛，望着『母親』的體貼與撫慰，甚至我們更希冀着，會有一天，我們便忘記了自己的媽！但，我們原是非常陌生的啊。異樣的心情，造成不可避免的衝突，母女間的距離越來越遠。爸有意的獻殷動，襯出我們更多的悲哀。到底，爸祇是爸啊！我們在寂寞裏徘徊，我們在孤獨裏徜徉，我們祇有眼紅着妹妹的幸福，別人的幸福。</p>
<p>姊姊是依着媽臨終說的，把我們撫養長大了。弟弟也會跳着電車上學堂了。媽！我一定，一定會給你爭氣的！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>

<p>（五）愛與慾的分野</p>
<p>這個符號的功效可眞不小，馬上就有一陣很輕快的脚步聲傳佈了出來，一會兒，二門敞開了，站在石階上的是一個布衣布裙，裝東完全跟女學生相同的少婦；可愛而眞誠實的笑容，浮現在她那不敷脂粉的臉上。這還有誰呢？當然，就是秋海棠兩天來時刻不忘的羅湘綺了</p>
<p>「來得早！」她把身子一側，讓秋海棠在又驚又喜的悄緒中走進了二門來。</p>
<p>第二進屋子的中堂裏，安着一張掛有白桌帔的方桌子，上面供着一個牌位，和燭台香爐之類，使秋海棠立刻想到了湘綺信裏所提起的爲了她的受騙，以致病勢加劇而不久就撤手西歸的母親。</p>
<p>湘綺引着他走進了兩邊的耳房。</p>
<p>「你在這裏侍一會好不好？」湘綺先招呼他在一張椅子上坐了，然後微微一笑，很活潑地奔進了後面去。</p>
<p>秋海棠竭力鎭定了自已的心神，抬起頭來，向屋子的四周打量着；這是一間長方形的屋子，佈置很簡單，但非常潔淨，一些沒有富貴的氣象，祗有一種古雅而幽靜的風趣。北面的壁上，掛着一張狹長的團體照，秋海棠走過去一看，便知道是湘綺從第一女師畢業的時候所照的了。照片上的人像大的祇有牛個指頭那麼入，但不消半分鍊，他就立刻把維湘綺找出來了。他對那一張黃豆大小的驗　伃細的端相着，覺得非常的眼熟，似乎這個人已跟他在一起生活有十多年了！</p>

<h3>「俠義雙雄」</h3>
<p>— 鄧士英</p>
<p>許多人都說「俠義雙雄」的演員好。我是同意的。以克拉克蓋博史本塞屈賽克勞黛考　白海蒂拉瑪四個「明星」過去的演技作為保證，「俠義雙雄」之在演技上値得一看，應是理所當然的。</p>
<p>但我以為「俠義雙雄」之成為一部好戲，四個「明星」本身演技的優越還是其次的事情。最主要的，還在於這個戲的故事已擺脫一般美國電影戀愛的俗套，和腳色的支配不曾以人害戲。——在過去，我們是看過太多的殺害了戲也殺害了「明星」本身的在「明星制度」下所產生的戲了。</p>
<p>「明星」本身不是罪惡，在好萊塢，「明星」這兩個字至少還建築在演技上；（它遠不如咱們中國電影界的成「明星」之後，他却就有了被「局限」的危機，為某個明星所特編的戲，往往是殺害了戲又殺害了明星。「俠義雙雄」的最大好處之一，便是演員沒有受到這樣硬裝的限制，克拉克蓋博和史本塞屈賽都合乎他們的性格，海蒂拉瑪的戲雖不多，但由於導演的處理得當，她給我們的印象却也不弱，比較受委曲的倒　克勞黛考爾白，她的「賢妻良母」雖演得極為賣力，較之與以前她的好幾個喜劇，却比較遜色了。</p>
<p>「俠義雙雄」有一個很動人的故事，兩個孔武有力好勇鬥狠性復燥急的漢子，不約而同地愛上了一個女人，當一個發現了朋友的妻子即是他念念不忘的愛人的時候，他却默然地忍痛退却了。以後，他為了愛人的幸福曾和他的好友打架，但當他的好友事業失敗，破產之餘幾至下獄當兒，他却挺身出來作證為好友開釋。</p>
<p>在劇本的編製上，作者是擺脫了一般美國電影處理戀愛的俗套的，但在分塲上，却沒有安排妥切，甚至顯得有些零亂和跳動，其原因，在於沒有把素材很好的編織，以至於粗看起來，素材多，情節曲折，這在我們中國電影是「生意素」，在崇尚單純的美國電影，却苦了編劇了。</p>
<p>「俠義雙雄」是根據詹姆士愛德華葛　小說改編的，我不知道　作怎樣，推想起來，分塲的有些紊亂或許有受了小說分章的影響；所以在分鏡頭中，作者的聰明便顯現出來了，打倒三個流氓，使排在一起，以及兩人打架後的出現海蒂拉瑪（兩人時打架時用近　接，也是很聰明的辦法）便是其例，其他在過塲上利用小　來調劑空氣，使這個戲不致陷於沉悶，都是。</p>
<p>「俠義雙雄」是我歡喜的一個戲。</p>

<h3>British Troops Rushing from Greece, Concentrating on Yugoslav Border; Yugoslav Cabinet Reorganized, Determined to Adhere to Axis; Turkey Sends Note to Germany, Vowing Resistance if Threatened</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – Because Yugoslavia decided to join Germany within 48 hours, British troops yesterday rushed from the weak Greek border, and it is reported that they have arrived at the Yugoslav border south of Vardar. This situation has suddenly become tense. It is said that there are at least 35,000 mechanized troops in the northern region of Salonica, plus Polish troops, Czech troops, and Free French troops. At that time, Yugoslav Prime Minister Cvetković and Foreign Minister Marković will set off for Vienna today to sign the treaty of joining the Axis. As for the cabinet turmoil caused by the resignation of two cabinet members, it has apparently eased. (Taiwan Public News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – After British troops rushed and concentrated on the Yugoslav border, the move of Yugoslavia joining the Axis was thwarted again last night. The authorities had just announced in the morning that the cabinet turmoil had been resolved and that the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were preparing to go to Vienna to sign the treaty. Unexpectedly, another incident occurred, and it is doubtful when Yugoslavia will join the Axis. On the one hand, Yugoslavia is threatened by Germany's "ultimatum", and on the other hand, it is "opened" by Britain, causing rumors to spread, but there are no demonstrations. The patriotic sports organizations broadcasting throughout the country held a meeting yesterday with 54 executives, representing 300,000 members, demanding that the government respect public opinion and sentiment, saying that signing the treaty would infuriate the people of the country. The organization's newspaper urged the government that "everything can be sacrificed, but the honor and freedom of the country cannot be sacrificed." University students belonging to opposition parties, such as the Radical Party, the Democratic Party, the Nationalist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Serbian Peasants' Party, Independence Democrats, have jointly protested to the government. The people of Brein, southern Serbia (2,600 people), who have always been known for being brave and warlike, telegraphed the government that if national freedom is harmed, they will rebel. (United Press Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – British Minister to Yugoslavia, Sir Campbell, has delivered a note to the Yugoslav government, but the content has not been released. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>London – The Daily Mail correspondent in Belgrade reported today that Greece has warned Yugoslavia that if it allows Germany to dispatch fire engines and military supplies through Yugoslav territory, Athens will consider it an act of hostility. The Daily Mail quoted diplomatic sources in the Yugoslav capital as saying that the reason why Yugoslavia has been slow to sign the Tripartite Pact is due to this warning. It is said that "when the warning was issued, the Yugoslav cabinet still wanted to achieve full unity to implement the decision made by the majority on Friday to accept Hitler's demands." (United Press Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Vichy – Diplomatic sources here declared today that the Turkish President recently replied to Hitler's note, saying that although Turkey wants to avoid war in the Balkans, if Turkey's security zone is threatened, Turkey cannot remain inactive. The Turkish President clearly stated that Salonica is also within Turkey's security zone. If attacking Trieste is used to attack the flank of Greece, it will inevitably involve Turkey. (Associated Press Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Turkish Capital – Turkish newspapers unanimously warned Yugoslavia today not to join the Axis. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London – The German High Command's communiqué this morning stated that the actions of the German army in Bulgaria are now proceeding according to plan. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister to Sign Treaty in Vienna</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – According to reliable sources, the Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will leave for Vienna tonight to sign an agreement with Germany, which is expected to take place around noon tomorrow. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – The Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister will take a special train to Vienna at 10 p.m. today to sign the treaty, adhering to the Tripartite Pact in a special form. Amidst the calls for signing, authorities throughout Yugoslavia strictly ordered the maintenance of public order and security. The authorities declared that they would use the most powerful methods to suppress expressions of opposition to the government and conspiracies of sabotage, foreign propaganda, and resistance to the government. (Taiwan Public News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – The new Yugoslav Minister of Agriculture, Nikitović, and the Minister of Social Hygiene Affairs, Ikonić, were sworn in this afternoon. Official reports say that the new Yugoslav cabinet now has a majority of nine cabinet members. (UPI Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – According to official announcements today, all three resigned cabinet members of Yugoslavia have been replaced. The new cabinet member, a certain public servant and manager named Nikitović, will serve as Minister of Agriculture, and Ikonić, a scholar of public law, will serve as Minister of Public Health. It is also reported that the official news agency of Yugoslavia reported that the Yugoslav Minister of Justice, Constantine, has withdrawn his resignation. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – The Yugoslav cabinet was reorganized this afternoon. Justice Minister Konstantinović has withdrawn his resignation, Ikonić has succeeded as Minister of Social Hygiene Affairs, and Nikitović has been appointed as Minister of Agriculture. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Reserve Officers' Meeting Opposes Submission to Germany</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – Three Serbian cabinet members resigned on Friday as a sign of opposition to accepting German conditions. Although it is rumored that their three vacancies have been filled, the political turmoil seems far from being resolved. The decision on whether or not Yugoslavia will compromise with Germany is still undecided. It is said that a special train has been fired up and is ready to carry Yugoslav executives to Vienna at any time, but whether this trip will materialize is still undecided. At the same time, the Association of Reserve Officers of Yugoslavia held a meeting and unanimously passed a proposal opposing any plan to conclude an agreement that is incompatible with national honor and independence. This proposal has been sent to the regents and the prime minister. After passing this proposal, the reserve officers adjourned the meeting without discussing other matters, indicating that this meeting was specifically held to oppose compromise with Germany. Some sources mistakenly reported that this association had been dissolved, but this is not the case. The officers who attended simply refused to continue the meeting. According to German news agency sources, Prince Regent Paul met with the Prime Minister yesterday, and the Prime Minister reported on the situation of talks with various political figures in recent days and proposed candidates to fill the three vacancies in the cabinet. According to Yugoslav official news agency sources, former Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović has requested an exit passport and is departing for Greece according to his own wishes. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – Despite public resentment and the concentration of British troops near the Yugoslav border in the Vardar River basin, the Yugoslav government seems to have decided today to join the Tripartite Pact. Observers believe that if the government joins the Axis, accidents may occur. There is another party here that opposes the signing of the Tripartite Pact, namely the Serbian Orthodox Church. The history of this church is closely related to the struggle of the Serbian people for freedom under Turkish rule. At that time, the church was the only treasure of Serbian customs. (United Press Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – Anti-German demonstrations in Yugoslavia are spreading wider and wider, and there have been bomb incidents, so Yugoslavia is now on the verge of civil strife. The first bomb incident occurred in the town of Susak, near the Italian border, when some pro-fascist and anti-Serbian party members threw a bomb at the monument to the Yugoslav national hero Peter I, destroying half of his statue. Yesterday, thousands of people demonstrated in the capital and other cities, as well as in many villages, demanding the maintenance of Yugoslav independence and integrity, even if it meant fighting Germany. The public unrest is increasing. (International Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Once Foreign Troops Enter, Promises Become Meaningless</h3>
<p>London – Turkish Radio last night broadcast the views of the Turkish newspaper Marous, saying that although the resignation of the three Yugoslav cabinet members indicates that the agreement has not been completely successful, the Serbian people and military leaders will never allow pro-German elements to act arbitrarily, knowing that once foreign troops enter the country, the promises written in black and white will eventually become meaningless. Therefore, Yugoslavia is still strengthening its army. It is certain that the Yugoslav army will not allow Yugoslav territory to be used as a tool in any conspiracy that is detrimental to the Greek army. The stronger the German pressure, the more obvious the Yugoslav resistance. This is especially evident in the Yugoslav newspapers' arguments against sacrificing national sovereignty and independence. British officials in Cairo recently stated that there are several factors that should encourage Yugoslavia to take a firm stand in dealing with German demands. First, the resignation of the three Yugoslav cabinet members to protest the compromise with Germany has been praised by the entire Yugoslav nation. The Yugoslav government cannot ignore this public opinion. Second, the talks between British and Turkish diplomats in Cyprus, which expressed the consensus of British and Turkish opinions, should also be considered by the Yugoslav government. Third, the material and military assistance and naval and air support provided by Britain to Greece can also be extended to Yugoslavia in the event of an attack on Yugoslavia. This should also be taken into account by the Yugoslav government. Fourth, Germany is now gradually aware that the position of the Italian army in East Africa is becoming increasingly difficult, so the military adventurousness in the Balkans has greatly increased. The Yugoslav government must have seen this kind of panic within Germany. Based on the above reasons, it can be seen that for the benefit of Yugoslavia and its neighbors, the path Yugoslavia must take is to emulate Greece and Turkey in firmly rejecting German threats.

<h3>Philippine Reporter Observes that the U.S. Will Not Abandon the Philippine Islands; Pacific Defenses Have Been Greatly Strengthened; The Purpose Is Clearly to Prevent Asian Aggression</h3>
<p>Manila – The Manila Bulletin issued a special edition today to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the newspaper. The newspaper's news editor, Wells, wrote an article saying that senior officials believe that if a crisis occurs in the Philippine Islands, the United States is capable and willing to protect the Philippine Islands. Wells has traveled to the United States for several months and met with President Roosevelt and many other officials. He recently returned to Manila via Pan American Airlines. The most important observation Wells gained from flying across the Pacific was the rapid construction of new airfields on Wake Island and Midway Island. These airfields can accommodate Flying Fortresses flying from the United States to the Philippines and can serve as bases for long-range bombers. This can prevent Tokyo from wanting to divert its naval and air power south because Japan believes that its country can be destroyed by American bombers. Wells said that using intercontinental aircraft can travel farther, have higher speeds, and carry more bombs. Therefore, if war breaks out between Japan and the United States, the striking power of the United States can be enhanced. American military views have gained two arguments: first, if Japan advances south, it must conquer or blockade the Philippines; second, if Japan declares war on the United States in accordance with the provisions of the Axis Pact, the Philippines, as a U.S. territory, is the first and easiest to be attacked. Therefore, the United States is now strengthening its entire defense in the Pacific. Wells also said that there are two different concepts in the United States, which is quite touching. One is that the announcements of the Washington administration may herald a fundamental and permanent conflict between the United States and Japan. The other is that the United States has huge reserves in financial resources, manpower, and economic power. Therefore, a country in the same position as Japan would not wage war against the United States, which is tantamount to suicide. Japan does not want to fight, but Japanese leaders have declared that the United States denies Japan's right to exist, and they also say that the only way to avoid war is for Japan to abandon its goals. Therefore, many Japanese people believe that even if war with the United States is tantamount to suicide, they are willing to do so. Wells also said that the position of isolationist sovereignty has lost much ground. In just one year, American public opinion has shifted from trying to avoid international involvement to being happy to get involved in the whirlpool of other countries. Americans are not yet willing to fully admit this change, but they are flowing into the change without realizing it. If the United States still has no Far East policy, then it is wrong. In fact, this policy has become increasingly clear. The government has任　使使 the United States to devote itself to defense preparations, the scale and cost of which are greater than any country in war. The actual number of the budget is 350 million U.S. dollars. The main fleet of the United States is in the Pacific. The government's purpose is to make the United States prevent Asian aggression so as not to endanger its territorial interests. Wells concluded that, according to the most difficult opinions to communicate, war between the United States and Japan is not inevitable at present, but there is indeed a possibility of war. (United Press Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>German Ambassadors in South America Hold Secret Meeting; Public Opinion in Peru is Shocked</h3>
<p>Santiago, Chile – The secret meeting held here on Friday by the German ambassadors to Argentina, Chile, and Peru has greatly shocked public opinion in Peru. According to telegrams from the capital, Peruvian people are demanding that their government investigate what conspiracy is behind this meeting. It is said that Chile initially had no knowledge of the Argentine and Peruvian ambassadors coming here to attend the meeting until the day of the meeting. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Warships Collide and are Damaged in Night Exercises</h3>
<p>Washington – The Navy Department announced yesterday that four destroyers collided and were damaged during night exercises by U.S. warships outside Pearl Harbor, but the damage was very light, and no personnel on board were injured. The ships were the "Armin," "Farragut," "Sorous," and "Warrington." (Associated Press Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Diet Adjourns Today</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Japanese Diet will hold the closing ceremony of this session of the Diet tomorrow, and members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will attend. This session of the Diet passed 14 budget bills and approved 87 laws. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Talks About the Results of His Trip to Europe; Will Decide the Issue of War and Peace; Foreign Policy Follows the Alliance Treaty; Will Discuss Soviet-Japanese Relations Again on the Return Journey</h3>
<p>Moscow – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived in Moscow yesterday, and those who greeted him at the station included Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Losovsky, Director of the Treaty Department of the Foreign Affairs Committee Bakov, Director of the Second Far East Department of the Foreign Affairs Committee Sharapokin, Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa and embassy staff, German Ambassador Schulenburg, Italian Ambassador Russo, Hungarian Minister Krytofyi, Slovak Minister Tisu, Bulgarian Minister Staminov, and Romanian Minister Gafencu. (TASS Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived here at 3:30 p.m. yesterday and is temporarily staying at the Soviet government's guest house. He will transfer to Berlin tonight. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tatekawa, will host a banquet in the evening. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka arrived here yesterday afternoon en route to Berlin. Diplomats from all countries that have joined the Axis Pact came to the station to greet him. Because of the severe wind and snow in the past two days, Matsuoka's arrival was delayed by two hours. German Ambassador Schulenburg arrived at the station later and apologized to Matsuoka in English. Matsuoka will visit Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today and is scheduled to depart for Berlin and Rome tonight. Japanese sources here expect that Matsuoka will return to Japan via Moscow on April 16. When Matsuoka met with foreign reporters, he said that if he does not personally discuss matters with the German and Italian leaders, the entire course of Japanese foreign policy may be different. The policies of various countries will ultimately depend on their fundamental interests, but the issue of war and peace can sometimes be decided face-to-face. Matsuoka also recounted that after the signing of the Tripartite Pact last September, he received a call from German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop inviting him to visit the Axis capitals. Eight years ago, he had a long talk with Mussolini and also met Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Shanghai, but he had no face-to-face meeting with the German leader. Matsuoka also said that Japan's foreign policy will revolve around the Tripartite Pact. As Foreign Minister, he helped to conclude the pact, so it is natural for him to visit the German leader. This trip may provide a new opportunity to observe the situation in Western Europe, especially the ongoing war. He did not specify a time limit for this trip, but he did not want to be away from Japan for more than six weeks. He was treated with great courtesy upon his arrival in Moscow. He wants to stop in Moscow on his return trip to meet with Soviet leaders. The scheduled program does not include巡　西歐情形. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka told reporters last night that after visiting Germany and Italy, he does not intend to go to London or Washington, but hopes to stay in Moscow for a few days on his return journey. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Vichy – Diplomatic observers said that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today is a formality. The two sides will only conduct lengthy talks when he returns to Moscow. The main goal of his trip is to visit Germany, and Soviet-Japanese issues will only be discussed on his way back. This issue is also very important to Japan, because Japan's ability to advance south depends on how this issue is resolved. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>China Pays Attention to Matsuoka's Activities</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese sources here continue to pay close attention to the activities of Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka in Moscow and Berlin, but there seems to be very little concrete news about Matsuoka's trip. Some believe that Matsuoka will complete preliminary negotiations with Moscow and Berlin first, and then make the trip, and that several concrete agreements will be signed as a result of this trip. Others believe that Matsuoka's trip to Moscow and Berlin does not bring any concrete solutions to the Far Eastern situation, but is actually seeking a solution. They all attach special importance to this, believing that Matsuoka will use his stay in Germany to determine what opportunities Germany's victory in Europe will create, so as to decide the path Japan should take in the future. It is generally believed that Matsuoka will discuss with Hitler the issue of the United States' possible active participation in the war and its impact on the position of Germany and Japan. It is generally believed that Matsuoka will persuade Hitler to pressure Chongqing to negotiate peace with Japan and request Hitler to order Moscow to stop Soviet aid to China. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to Japanese official sources, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union was also among those present during Foreign Minister Matsuoka's official visit in Moscow. Matsuoka later visited the Ambassador of the Vichy French government to the Soviet Union. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Warships Chase German Warships in the Atlantic</h3>
<p>London – German radio announced today that British warships chased German warships in the Atlantic for two days. It is said that several British heavy warships, including one Malaya-class battleship, followed the German battle fleet attacking merchant ships in the Atlantic for two days. British warships attempted to make contact with the German fleet when the German warships attacked ships on the Australian-Indian route in the territorial waters of the Shetland Islands. On another occasion, one British Wilson-class battleship was not far from the German attack ship. Officials here pointed out that Germany often publishes various news about British warships in order to elicit information. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Lamenting Shanghai</h3>
<p>Please look at Shanghai today, what a world it has become! Has there ever been one as bad as today before? Is there any place outside Shanghai as bad as Shanghai? The worst of the worst, unprecedented in ancient and modern times, in China and abroad, what has caused it? We cherish Shanghai, and we are heartbroken to see this phenomenon, and we are worried and indignant about its future. We deeply lament Shanghai, and we cannot bear not to appeal to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Examining Shanghai: Shanghai's sins against human civilization and the Chinese nation can be said to be innumerable. However, this is only one side of Shanghai: cultural exchanges between China and foreign countries are carried out here, and Chinese and foreign goods are imported and exported here. Through this communication and throughput, it has directly and indirectly contributed to this century. Its achievements cannot be denied. If we are to make impassioned arguments, it is difficult to argue with one point. If it is said that after Shanghai became an isolated island, its manpower and material resources did not make a significant contribution to the great cause of resistance and construction, and central government orders were difficult to implement, and foreign exchange and other general consumption were undoubtedly a leakage of national power, then it is a superfluous tumor. This is one argument. If it is said that Shanghai relies on international forces, which hinders control in case of emergency, so that the achievements of the conquest cannot be carried out, then it is an obstacle. This is another argument. If it is said that Shanghai has eroded the basic principles and morality of human society in general, so that evils such as fraud, monopoly, opium, gambling, murder, etc., can all be indulged, then it is a den of demons. This is another argument. If it is said that traffic between Shanghai and the mainland is blocked, it has lost its geographical advantage, and is no longer a trade hub, with nothing to plan and no business to operate, then after a hundred years of opening up, the last days are approaching, then it is a ruin. This is another argument. Of all these arguments, the viewpoints are very different, and almost the same conclusion can be drawn: abandon it, destroy it, and there is nothing to be lamented. However, upon careful observation of the situation, not only do we cling to the old and adhere to the law, but those who truly cherish Shanghai as we do do not want to abandon Shanghai, destroy Shanghai, and cannot bear to see it being abandoned and destroyed; too much is as bad as too little, and we cherish it and love it so much, that we爭 it so much. Alas, who knows that爭 it is the reason for destroying it!</p>
<p>Two years ago in mid-March, Shanghai's concessions were in turmoil, and it seemed that they could not be protected for long. When this newspaper discussed it, it said, "Who wants to destroy Shanghai? I believe that no one wants to destroy it; who can destroy Shanghai? I believe that no one cannot destroy it. Only because no one wants to destroy it, even though it has gone through many tribulations, it has finally been preserved by the forbearance of all parties, as it is today. If there is no forbearance, it will disintegrate; the turmoil and unrest are almost signs of disintegration; however, is this the original wish of all parties? If you want to destroy Shanghai, it is very easy to destroy it; if the original wish is not like this, then it is hoped that all parties will be brave in reflecting and examining themselves." At that time, the factors of unrest were different from those of today; however, what was discussed at that time still holds true to this day, and will always hold true. Why is it that preservation is due to forbearance, and forbearance is due to the fact that each party has something to cherish. If there is nothing to cherish in Shanghai, then this small area can be razed to the ground as easily as turning one's hand, who can protect it? Please收斂 the posture of drawing swords and preparing bows, please think calmly, is this not the logic, is this not the situation and the勢!</p>
<p>Or we think that争 is to destroy. It is indeed because Shanghai is not to be爭. Shanghai is Shanghai because of its complexity; to爭 it is to消長, to transform complexity into purity, then although Shanghai is not leveled, it will变质 and变态 and no longer maintain its 非常可重, 非常可愛的 Shanghai. Not only is it not to be爭, it is also unnecessary to爭. Shanghai is Shanghai, with absolutely no independence, but only смотря at the great environment; if the environment is safe, then Shanghai is safe, if the environment is dangerous, then Shanghai is dangerous, if the environment is black, then it is black, if the environment is white, then it is white; today's Shanghai, the world as a whole is the environment from which it transforms. If Shanghai is not destroyed, then the world situation will dominate Shanghai's progress; it is also regardless of whether Shanghai is destroyed or not, it is absolutely not enough to determine the world situation, it is absolutely not enough to change the environment in which it is located. Therefore, it is said that Shanghai is unnecessary to爭. To爭 for Shanghai, then what is to be爭 should be outside Shanghai, above Shanghai. To爭 in Shanghai, then no matter what is to be爭 for control, what is to be爭 for honor and disgrace, what is to be爭 for anger and grudges, to爭 in Shanghai will destroy Shanghai!</p>
<p>We cherish Shanghai, lament Shanghai, and therefore appeal to Shanghai, may those who do not want to destroy Shanghai be blessed!</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Schedules Regular Meetings to Review Academic Terminology; Seven Subjects Including Electrical Engineering</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Because scholars translate various academic terms in China independently, discrepancies and inconsistencies often arise, which greatly inconveniences academic research. After the establishment of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, compiling and standardizing terminology became one of its major tasks. The compilation process involves first collecting English, German, French, and Japanese terms for each discipline, consulting existing translations, carefully selecting and rejecting terms, and translating them appropriately. The Ministry of Education then hires domestic experts to organize review committees to scrutinize the terms. It takes two or three years of careful study and discussion before each compilation is published. Since the establishment of the Bureau in 1932, it has published terms for fifteen subjects, including astronomy, mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Thirty-two subjects, including philosophy, sociology, politics, and economics, have been compiled and sent to experts for review. Thirty-three subjects, including anthropology, physiology, pathology, and physical education, are currently being compiled. Currently, the terminology for seven subjects, including society, education, economics, statistics, electrical engineering (electricity), mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering, has been individually reviewed by experts in each field. The Ministry of Education has specifically scheduled review meetings to be held at the Central Library in Chongqing starting at 9:00 a.m. on the 26th of this month. Each subject has several thousand terms, with mechanical engineering having the most, with over 17,000 terms. It is reported that committee members from various regions have arrived in Chongqing one after another, prepared to attend the discussion. (Telegram dated the 24th)</p>

<h3>Strengthening the Transportation Efficiency of the Yunnan-Burma Road; Establishing a Transportation Engineering Supervisory Committee; Directly Under the Military Affairs Commission's Transportation Management Committee; Yu Feipeng as Chairman, Office Opens on May 1st</h3>
<p>Chongqing: News today states that because the construction of the railway between Kunming and Lashio is still far off, the government is now making various efforts to increase the transportation capacity of the Yunnan-Burma Road. People here are paying close attention to the planned railway between Kunming and Lashio and the supplementary highway currently under construction. However, it is generally believed that before the completion of the long, five- to six-hundred-mile railway between Kunming and Lashio, the most feasible way to increase the import volume via Burma is to increase the efficiency of the Burma Road. Recognizing this, the Chinese authorities are currently organizing a committee, which is reportedly to be named the "Yunnan-Burma Road Transportation Engineering Supervisory Committee." It is also reported that Yu Feipeng will be the chairman of the committee, with Mr. Baker as the chief inspector. It is also reported that the other members of this five-person committee will be Minister of Communications Zhang Jia'ao, a Burmese official, and another Chinese. The committee will begin work on May 1st. It is further reported that under the chief inspector, Mr. Baker, there will be one assistant chief inspector, in addition to five inspectors, in charge of transportation, engineering, repair, supply, and training personnel. The chief inspector's office will become an adjusting administrative body, handling all concrete problems in the transportation on the Yunnan-Burma Road. The committee will be controlled by the Military Affairs Commission and directly subordinate to the Transportation Management Committee under the Military Affairs Commission, which manages all wartime transportation in the country. Mr. Baker will leave Chongqing on Wednesday for Kunming, where he will begin conducting inspections along the road. Mr. Baker will also meet with Burmese authorities in Lashio. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: A spokesperson for the Chinese ambassador here declined to comment on the news of the Yunnan-Burma Railway, saying that any news to be released should come from the United States. Well-informed sources here are paying close attention to this news, saying that the United States must have encouraged the construction of this railway and indicated that it would cooperate by providing construction materials and vehicles, and may even have encouraged Chongqing to issue US$100 million in bonds to finance the construction of the road, but the United States may not directly sign or guarantee the issuance of these bonds. Officials here also believe that if this railway is completed quickly, it will be very useful, and also said that although Japan will bomb this road as it did with the Yunnan-Burma Road, the roadbed of this railway will be the same as the highway, making it extremely easy to repair, and fortunately, the railway can operate at night and repairs can be carried out during the day. These sources also pointed out that this railway will not only increase the volume of goods transported to the Chinese interior, but will also facilitate the export of Chinese goods. Now that the Japanese are still focused on Europe and the Soviet Union is still suspicious of Germany and Japan, China's construction of the railway is an excellent opportunity because there is no interference from any party at this time. Some experts estimate that the railway between Kunming and Lashio can be completed within one year. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: It was learned today that regarding the issuance of US$100 million in public bonds in the United States to build the Yunnan-Burma Railway, although the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications have obtained the permission of the highest authorities and formulated a detailed plan, the legislative procedures have not yet been completed. Authoritative sources declared that this plan will be discussed at the weekly meeting of the Executive Yuan and then sent to the Supreme National Defense Council for final approval. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: There was interest here yesterday in the news reported in the newspapers that China plans to build a railway from Kunming to Lashio. News from Chongqing said that the United States jointly decided on this railway and agreed to issue US$10 million in construction bonds in the United States as economic aid. It was also said that Dr. John R. Steelman, administrative assistant to President Roosevelt, had proposed this railway plan in his report. Officials have not yet confirmed this. Yesterday, news from Chongqing said that two railway engineers and a well-known Chinese businessman from San Francisco had recently left Chongqing for the United States to promote this plan. Well-informed sources said that Chongqing had been studying this plan for a long time, but the changes in the world situation recently prompted its active implementation. Finance Ministry officials said that the Ministry of Finance has not yet taken any special action on this matter. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin French Concession Power Plant; Labor Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>Tianjin: At 4:20 this afternoon, Chinese employees of the French Concession power plant went on strike, causing parts of the French Concession to be without light for several hours tonight. The strike was resolved at 10:00 p.m., and work was immediately resumed. The French Consul in Tianjin, Mr. Collin de Boisriou, went to the plant to assist in the negotiations and accepted the demands put forward by the strikers. The areas affected by the strike included the areas where the French consulate and the French military barracks were located. The strikers made nine demands, including two demands to increase wages and reduce working hours to eight hours per day, which were accepted by the plant after negotiations. The remaining seven demands, including workers' pensions, will be discussed tomorrow. According to Chinese sources, the strikers demanded an additional twenty yuan on top of the current monthly rice subsidy. (Reuters telegram dated the 24th)</p>

<h3>Affected by the Wars in Europe, Asia, and Africa; North and South America Intensify Cooperation; Refusing Intrusion of Non-American Powers; Signing Reciprocal Trade Agreements to Seek Economic Prosperity</h3>
<p>Washington: The year 1940 has already come to an end. In this year, the material cooperation and friendly relations between the United States and other countries in the Americas have reached an unprecedented high point in the history of Pan-American relations. Because the economies of most countries in the entire Western Hemisphere were affected by the wars in Europe, Asia, and Africa, the governments of the countries in the New World took unanimous steps this year to prevent the wars from extending to the coasts of these countries, while also seeking ways to cultivate their economies. Among the various methods, financial assistance from the United States was the most important. A prominent example of Pan-Americanism this year was the meeting of foreign ministers held in Havana last July.</p>
<p>Signing Treaties to Strengthen Defense</p>
<p>At this meeting, many treaty agreements were signed, the main purpose of which was to organize and strengthen the defense of the American continent. The most important of the agreements was the unanimous expression by the American countries of opposition to the transfer of sovereignty over territories in the Western Hemisphere from non-American countries to other parties. This agreement was clearly intended to prevent the Axis powers from taking over the territories of France, the Netherlands, and even Britain, and establishing a foothold in the Americas. This agreement also stipulated a method whereby, if the territories of France, the Netherlands, and other countries in the Western Hemisphere were threatened, one or more countries in the Americas would rise up and occupy the threatened territories. This meeting was held in a very tense atmosphere, and the opinions of the various countries on all major issues quickly converged, which was commendable, and it was considered reasonable that this convergence of opinions should occur at a Pan-American meeting.</p>
<p>US Trades Warships for Bases</p>
<p>After this meeting, Britain and the United States traded warships for bases. The United States used fifty old destroyers to exchange for naval and air bases in Newfoundland, Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, Trinidad, and British Guiana. The United States' acquisition of these bases is extremely important for the defense of the American continent, especially the defense of Panama. After this exchange was established, the US State Department immediately declared that other republics in the Americas could also use these bases. At the end of the year, negotiations between the United States and Latin American countries on the defense of the American continent still seemed to have latent difficulties, because the Uruguayan Senate had expressed opposition to this kind of negotiation, while the Uruguayan House of Representatives supported the government's policy, and President Alfredo Baldomir officially stated that his government had launched a defensive cooperation plan. By December, the important meeting between the foreign ministers of Uruguay and Argentina had laid the cornerstone of defensive cooperation, and special attention was paid to general cooperation between the two countries in the defense of the Western Hemisphere. The leaders of the governments of Ecuador, Costa Rica, and the Dominican Republic stated that they were doing their best to expand various important facilities for the United States to engage in continental defense, and it was generally expected that an agreement on defense cooperation between Mexico and the United States could also be established soon.</p>
<p>Countries Prevent Fifth Columns</p>
<p>Many Latin American governments have recognized the activities of fifth columns. A shocking Nazi conspiracy has been discovered in Uruguay, which has aroused the research of the legislative body, while the Argentine authorities are still closely investigating the activities of the Nazi Party in the Misiones Province from an administrative and judicial perspective. Mexico and Brazil have ordered the expulsion of dozens of Nazi consular officials and diplomats engaged in propaganda activities, and the Cuban Senate has also requested the government to implement an ordinance on the totalitarians engaging in propaganda. Colombia is also implementing various laws and regulations to resist the fifth columns of the Fascist Party and the Communist Party. After the German-operated SCADTA airline in Colombia was liberated, Ecuador signed a contract with Pan American-Grace Airways, and SCADTA's monopoly in the Ecuadorian airline industry was also deprived. Latin American countries have suffered almost entirely from the pain of war in commerce, industry, and finance.</p>
<p>US Provides Credit Loans to Various Countries</p>
<p>Last summer, the US Congress increased the capital of the Export-Import Bank of Washington by $500 million to assist Latin America. Last December, the United States announced that it would allocate $50 million from the US Treasury's stabilization fund and provide $60 million in credit from the Export-Import Bank to Argentina. These two loans were to alleviate Argentina's economic pressure, one effect of which was the partial lifting of US dollar exchange restrictions, allowing US goods to be imported into Argentina, because Argentina had reached a point where its trade deficit with the United States had caused US imports to almost come to a standstill. The Export-Import Bank also advanced US$20 million to Brazil to enable Brazil to start a steel industry. In addition, the United States also provided loans to other countries in Latin America for these countries to engage in the construction of public works, industries, railway equipment and materials, and stabilize exchange rates. Mostly due to US cooperation, the coffee-producing countries of the Americas have formed a coffee cartel. Each country is permitted by the United States to import an equal amount of coffee into the United States. This approach is sufficient to save these coffee growers, who are facing danger due to the loss of European markets. Officials in many Latin American countries have expressed their willingness to promote larger markets in the United States, rather than hoping to borrow funds. People in various countries are studying ways to expand their markets. Negotiations between the United States and Bolivia to purchase large quantities of Bolivian tin have begun. These Bolivian tin will be shipped to the United States for refining in the future. Also, in mid-December, negotiations on the United States purchasing large quantities of Chilean nitrates and copper produced by Chile and Peru were underway. South American countries, initiated by Brazil and Argentina, are working to sign a reciprocal trade agreement to reduce tariffs and other restrictions between each other and increase their commerce. Also, many countries are engaged in national defense preparations.</p>
<p>Military Personnel from Various Countries Come to the US for Observation</p>
<p>The Argentine Congress is considering a US$100 million rearmament plan. Uruguay is also preparing a military plan. Brazil has been engaged in large-scale peacetime maneuvers. Chile has increased its conscription quota, and representatives of the US Army, Navy, and Air Force have been sent to several important countries. At the end of last year, chiefs of staff and senior military officers from various Latin American countries inquired with the United States, becoming guests of the US Department of the Army and visiting various army outposts, airfields, military training camps, and arsenals.

<h3>Labor Strike Occurs in US Steel Plant</h3>
<p>Bethlehem: A strike occurred at the Bethlehem Steel Company's plant here today, and national defense orders worth US$150,000 are also in jeopardy. The Steel Workers Organizing Committee notified the company last night that if it did not cancel the election of officers of its independent employee association, 18,000 workers would strike today. At the same time, the Steel Workers Organizing Committee protested to the Production Management Bureau against the employee representation method of the Bethlehem Steel Company, which had been declared illegal by the National Labor Relations Board.

<h3>US Aid to Britain and Other Bills Will Be Signed by the President; Documents Sent by Airplane to Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Washington: Congress this week will be able to send President Roosevelt a rearmament and aid-to-Britain appropriation bill worth nearly $15,000,000,000. The main body of this huge sum is actually a combination of three bills, the largest of which is the $700 billion aid-to-Britain bill, which should be passed within the next day or two. Other steps include the $3,415,000,000 naval appropriation bill, which was passed by the Senate on Thursday, and the $4,073,000,000 national defense supplementary bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives on Friday. The government today attempted to have the Argentine corned beef order re-voted because Vice President Wallace's absence from the vote caused the bill to be rejected in the Senate by a vote of 32 to 32. This action will delay the consideration of the $700 billion US aid bill today by an hour or two. Majority party leader Senator Barkley said that Democratic Senator Russell of Georgia had voted in favor of amending the corned beef order, but it was not recorded, so the actual vote on the amendment should have been 33 to 32. The authorities will immediately clarify this point. The rejection of the amendment to the corned beef order was actually the government's biggest defeat since the Lend-Lease Act. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt today commissioned Chester Bowles as chairman of the newly established Supreme Mediation Board, and also appointed ten other members to the board. Thereafter, the board has full authority to mediate labor disputes in national defense production. The commission was issued yesterday along with other documents to the naval patrol bomber carrying them to the President's yacht, the Potomac. Working in the tropical sun, the President signed several bills, including a bill appropriating US$100 million to build public works for the US Navy. The President and his party are now planning to continue fishing on a cruise to the Caribbean Sea in the next few days. (United Press telegram dated the 24th)</p>

<h3>US Steel Production is Enormous; All for Use by Britain and Canada</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Herald Tribune reported that the chairman of the board of the United States Steel Corporation, Mr. Olds, said that the quantity of steel currently being produced by the company for the manufacture of military weapons is far greater than during the First World War, and the number of workers employed is also unprecedented. A large quantity of this steel is now being shipped to Britain and Canada. (Reuters telegram dated the 24th)</p>
<h3>The United States Will Join the European War No Later Than June</h3>
<p>Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun today predicted that the United States will join the European war no later than June and as early as April. The trigger will be the sinking of American grain-carrying convoy ships by Germany. It is said that the domestic grain production in the United Kingdom is only enough to meet 40% of its needs, and the reserves can only last until August this year. Therefore, the US transport of grain is absolutely essential. If the United States cannot escort food to the UK with transport ships, its Lend-Lease Act cannot take effect.

<h3>British Officials Criticize the US for Transporting Food to France; This Move Must Guard Against Supplying the Enemy; Pétain Secretly Banquets the US Ambassador</h3>
<p>London - Authoritative sources this morning said that the US's hasty decision to transport food to unoccupied areas of France would undermine the effect of the British blockade, or could lead to "increasing conflicts." Semi-official sources said that the British are currently trying to satisfy Americans who express sympathy for the Free Zone of France. However, if the Americans transporting food do not "cooperate closely" with the blockade authorities, a serious situation may arise. The United States announced that two more ships will transport food to France. British officials were very surprised to hear this. It is said that British officials knew early on that the second batch of food could only be shipped after the first batch of grain had been distributed and it had been verified that it had not fallen into the hands of the Germans. The United Kingdom certainly does not want to argue with the United States about this matter. However, although this matter is said to be motivated by humanitarianism, it will lighten Germany's food burden on France and may make the blockade policy not worth the loss. (International News Agency dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>London - Yesterday, it was said here that according to news from Washington, the United States' intention to ship two ships of flour to unoccupied France does not mean that the UK will open its blockade line, and it is believed that shipping issues are still under discussion. Undersecretary of State Welles declared in Washington on Saturday that the US State Department has completed the loading of two ships of flour for shipment to France. This flour will be distributed by the American Red Cross. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Vichy - Marshal Pétain, the head of France, gave a "secret" banquet for US Ambassador Leahy on Saturday night. Guests included Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Navy Darlan, and the envoy and leader of the diplomatic corps Valery, a total of twenty people. Officials strictly kept the banquet a secret, and reporters were not allowed to send telegrams before midnight. The reason was not explained, but the US Embassy had previously announced that there would be a banquet. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - Regarding the matter of two French cargo ships about to load a large amount of food and sail to the Free Zone of France, although opinions vary among the newspapers here, they all praised the French Ambassador to the United States, Henry-Haye. For example, the "Washington Times" stated, "French Ambassador to the United States, Henry-Haye, has been working hard in the past two months to enable the United States to transport food to France, and has now achieved success, which is a great success in Ambassador Henry-Haye's diplomatic activities." (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>The United States Transports Food Supplies to the United Kingdom</h3>
<p>Washington - Yesterday, reliable sources here revealed that the government is currently loading a large amount of food for transport to the UK, and has established a special department of the Agricultural Committee to assist the British government. The committee intends to carry out its affairs with 500 million yuan. At the same time, President Roosevelt is also planning to establish a federal food execution agency. The first batch of goods to be shipped to the UK includes 12 million pounds of lard, because the United States' lard reserves have increased greatly, with 31.75 million pounds, an increase of 6.1 million pounds compared to last year, and exceeding the average by 16.15 million pounds. At the same time, there is also an increase in surplus vegetable oil. It is said that the government does not fully know all the food items needed by the UK, but only knows that powdered milk, cheese, white pagoda eggs, pork, dried fruits, and animal fats are needed by the UK, and it is rumored that the British have sent a special commissioner to come to the United States soon.

<p>London - Yesterday was the National Day of Prayer. The King and Queen, and the Princesses, also mingled with the public, attending services in churches to pray. Every half hour before noon, each church held a Mass. Thousands of people gathered in the churches to prostrate themselves and pray for God to eliminate the tyrannical power of dictators as soon as possible. Millions of people prayed. Bomb and gun sounds were often heard during the prayer, but no one was frightened away. The Archbishop of Canterbury broadcasted last night, briefly saying that we should think of the hundreds of millions of people in many countries who are now enslaved by the enemy, who are yearning for our victory to save them. Consider the desire for the entire Empire to be united and the victories that the British army has already achieved. We do not sincerely have reason to be proud that we bear the noblest mission. The Catholic Cardinal and Slade also broadcast, encouraging the people to fight against the dark forces that resist God to maintain justice and righteousness. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>London - Last night, British planes attacked Berlin again. This was the thirtieth time since the start of the war. According to the official announcement here, the bombing was very successful, but not very intense. British air units also carried out short-term bombings of enemy invasion bases last night. Targets in the Calais area were also among them. Major explosions could be heard on the southeastern coast of the UK. Although the French coast was shrouded in thick fog at the time, flashes could still be seen across the sea. A reporter for the Berlin non-commercial radio station has admitted to the air raid there, saying that several British bombers participated in the bombing, but only a few were able to reach the city center. High-explosive bombs were dropped from high altitude. Only residential areas in Berlin and its suburbs were bombed, and the damage was minimal. Several fires were extinguished immediately, but several soldiers and civilians were killed or injured. The reporter also said that British aircraft also invaded northern Germany, but the German side broadcasting to the United States said that British bombers only reached the suburbs of Berlin. The reporter also made contradictory remarks, saying that several incendiary bombs fell in the embassy area of Berlin. The embassy area is located in the center of Berlin, very close to Wilhelm Street, where most German government agencies are located. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>London - Yesterday, people in a southern English town had just left the church when they witnessed a British fighter plane engaged in combat with and shooting down a German bomber. Yesterday, British airspace saw only slight enemy aircraft activity, and a total of two German bombers were shot down. This was one of them. The tail of the second German plane, in northern Scotland, was hit by anti-aircraft fire while attempting to bomb ships in a mooring port. It caught fire and crashed. Yesterday morning, several German planes sneaked close to southwestern England and were repelled by intense anti-aircraft fire. An Air Ministry communiqué stated that yesterday, enemy aircraft separately sneaked to the coast near the English Channel and an area in northern Scotland to drop bombs, causing slight damage and few casualties. Plymouth has begun clearing after two days of heavy bombing. Rescue teams are constantly rescuing injured and killed people from under the rubble. Soldiers of the army and navy have been clearing dangerous broken walls for more than forty-eight hours. It has now been revealed that several children under the age of ten have died in the bombing. Two hospitals have been evacuated, and another small hospital has been completely destroyed. The King and Queen toured Plymouth the day before it was bombed. The Lady Astor, wife of the Mayor of Plymouth, said, "No matter what suffering the people of Plymouth endure, I know their spirit will be able to cope with it." (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>New Zealand Rushes to Build Naval and Land War Equipment; Canada Approves War Expenses</h3>
<p>Wellington - New Zealand's war effort is showing greater development every week. Several machine factories are now manufacturing various war equipment. Government factories are also busy manufacturing machine gun mounts and three-inch mortars. The manufacture of small arms will soon double to meet the needs of the New Zealand army. The manufacture of naval war equipment has also made progress. Auckland is currently building minesweepers to meet the urgent needs of the navy. After a New Zealand delegation went to New Delhi to participate in the conference of British territories east of the Suez Canal, it has conveyed the need for British technicians to study New Zealand's industrial possibilities, aimed at assisting the British Empire's overseas war effort and defending the dominion. These British technicians are now reporting their research results to the British government, and it is expected that the British government will formulate a manufacturing process suitable for New Zealand to implement within a considerable period of time.

<p>New York - According to Canadian newspapers, the Canadian House of Commons has approved 130 million yuan in war expenses, starting from April 1, for a period of one year. (TASS dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>The UK Plans to Adjust Post-War Industry</h3>
<p>London - British industry is now focused on the war effort, causing many non-essential industries to be shut down. This matter is now of great concern. It is expected that the Minister of Commerce Lyttelton will announce more specific measures in Parliament to adjust the status of these industries after the war. A parliamentary reporter for the Observer said that the House of Commons will definitely be dissatisfied if there is not enough opportunity to discuss the entire major issue of post-war industrial construction. It is heard that the government now has a plan in mind, and has scheduled several plans for the transition period. It is expected that after the end of the war, there will be a period of industrial organization disorder. At that time, there may be a need to establish businesses to barter. Since the United States is now able to supply democratic countries during wartime, it will also be able to undertake the work of supplying the world during peacetime in the future. Therefore, the House of Commons will ask the government whether it has sought or is preparing to seek to conduct research on economic recovery with the US authorities in advance. The general impression is that within a few months after the armistice, there will inevitably be extreme difficulties such as those that occurred after the last war. First, there will be a global need for the supply of goods, and then there will be the danger of a major business collapse and a sharp drop in prices. These economic anomalies should be prevented as far as possible with far-sighted plans and appropriate deployments. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>The Spanish Government Clarifies Its Diplomatic Attitude</h3>
<p>Madrid - Since the United States passed the Lend-Lease Act, Spanish officials have recently stated their diplomatic policy for the first time, especially emphasizing that Spain can maintain a neutral position in the current war. According to Duval Pon, the head of the Spanish Information and Propaganda Department who recently accompanied Spanish Foreign Minister Sunner to Germany and Italy, "Our most serious danger is the geographical location of Spain. If we do not have military equipment or are careless, we cannot survive. Spain has been unknown for hundreds of years, and now wants to stand out. Hitler's current actions remind people of what Napoleon did in the past, but Napoleon added misfortune to Spain, while Hitler strictly punishes France and Britain, which made Spain a third-rate country."

<h3>British Military Communiqué Announces the Capture of an Important Town in Abyssinia; Will Take the Abyssinian Capital Directly from Neghelli; Fighting Continues in the Keren Area</h3>
<p>Cairo - After the British army occupied Neghelli, an important town in southern Abyssinia, it tightened the British encirclement around Addis Ababa. Neghelli controls the intersection of avenues leading to the north, east, and west, and is strategically important. The British Imperial Army can now directly take the Abyssinian capital, which is 275 miles away to the north. According to military experts, the countryside there is low-lying, and the British army can advance along the roads that run through the river basin without much hindrance. The fall of Neghelli is undoubtedly a major blow to Italian General Graziani. When Italy invaded Abyssinia, Graziani led his troops to advance rapidly and was awarded the title of Baron of Neghelli. The British military communiqué announced the capture of Neghelli and stated that the fighting in other areas of Abyssinia continued to develop in favor of the British army. The fighting in the Keren area continued. On Saturday, the British army won several local victories and surrounded Keren remotely. Patrols were active. When a patrol encountered enemy troops near a battery, it notified the artillery unit for assistance. The British artillery immediately opened fire, and the British patrol used artillery fire to assist in destroying enemy troops and capturing 130 enemy soldiers. The British army suffered no losses. The communiqué ended by saying that there was nothing to report in Libya. Also, the British Air Force communiqué stated that the British Air Force engaged in extensive activities in Italian East Africa to assist the British army on land. Fighter planes repeatedly attacked enemy positions in the Keren area. The Asmara railway station was heavily bombed on Saturday. British fighter planes that launched the attack clashed with several Italian Fiat fighter planes. Two enemy planes were hit and caught fire and crashed. Enemy barracks and warehouses in the Gondar area were bombed and set on fire. South African British troops attacked a train on the Djibouti to Addis Ababa railway, and at least one train was hit and burned. British bombers also strafed trains in Afdan and Gora, and bombed motor transport convoys and enemy positions on the highway. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>Italy Exhausted and Anxious, Attempting to Reorganize the Defeated Troops in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>London - Athens Radio broadcast the words of an Italian prisoner. It is said that after the failure of the Italian army's major offensive on the Albanian front, it tried its best to dig trenches in an attempt to defend to the death, while the army's officials tried to reorganize the defeated army. The Italian army on the Tepelene front was severely attacked by the Greek army and fled back in disarray. It is now hastily deploying defenses along the front. There are now only small-scale tree battles, but both sides' artillery units are active. Also, the British Air Force communiqué stated that on Saturday, enemy fighter planes continuously attacked a British Air Force base in western Greece. The material damage was minor, and there were no casualties. One enemy plane was shot down, and several were heavily damaged. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Athens - There was a huge artillery battle on the Albanian front yesterday. The Italian army suddenly dug trenches near the "Valley of Death" to defend to the death. There were many Italian soldiers' bodies scattered in the valley. A spokesman for the Greek government said that the Greek army had broken through the Italian army's front in several places and had captured many prisoners. "Greek artillery fire severely damaged the Italian troops reinforcing the front line." Italian outposts were captured after entering the Greek front line. Reports said that during the artillery battle, the Italian artillery unit consumed countless shells, but the Greek position remained unmoved. (United Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<h3>French Commercial Attaché Beaten in Japan; US Ambassador, Representing the Diplomatic Corps, Protests to Matsuoka</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to responsible sources here today, US Ambassador Grew sent a letter of protest to Foreign Minister Matsuoka before Matsuoka left for Berlin regarding the insult to French Commercial Attaché Thaischiel in Kobe. This matter occurred nearly three weeks ago, and Japanese newspapers have not published a single word about it. It is heard that the US Ambassador's letter was in the name of the diplomatic corps, as he is the leader of the corps. The content of the letter protested the fact that the French Commercial Attaché was beaten by a group of rickshaw pullers at the Kobe pier for no reason, and other incidents of insults against foreigners in Japan. The US Ambassador's letter caused Foreign Minister Matsuoka to issue a statement to the Japanese people on the train to Osaka, expressing his dissatisfaction with this action, which violated Japan's tradition of hospitality and national honor.

<h3>International Anecdotes (10) (2) Four Giants of US War Preparation</h3>
<p>The United States' unprecedented expansion of armaments plan is directed by a large-scale manufacturer, a labor leader, a newspaper publisher, and a lawyer and politician. Among these four giants, one is Knudsen, the former general manager of General Motors, now chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission and director of the Armaments Manufacturing Department, one is Hillman, chairman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, now vice chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission and director of the Labor Department, one is Colonel Knox, publisher of the Chicago Daily News, now Secretary of the Navy, and the other is Colonel Stimson, formerly a lawyer in New York and then Secretary of State, now Secretary of War. They must all assist President Roosevelt in sharing the powers granted by the Constitution and Congress.</p>
<p>These four figures come from different backgrounds, but none of them are Democrats. Knox and Stimson belong to the Republican Party. Hillman and Knudsen are not affiliated with any party, and neither of them are Americans. Knudsen was originally from Denmark, and Hillman was originally from Lithuania. Both immigrated to the United States at the age of twenty.</p>
<p>In the minds of the general public, Knudsen is an outstanding mass manufacturer who resigned from his position as general manager of General Motors with an annual salary of $300,400 (one of the ten highest-paid positions in the United States, with an average daily salary of $830) to work as a defense commissioner without taking a penny. He is not someone ordinary. He is now fifty-eight years old. When he first came to the United States, he worked at the Ford Motor Company and soon became the only favorite of "Automobile King" Ford. In 1922, he changed his job to become the deputy manager of Chevrolet Motor Company. In 1937, he became the general manager of General Motors until he was selected by President Roosevelt. This person is six feet tall, with silver hair and a pair of pince-nez glasses with black ribbons. He usually walks quickly and does not like to talk at length.</p>
<p>Hillman is a burly man with glasses and black hair. He is now fifty-three years old and is a Jew born in Lithuania. Since 1915, he has been elected as the chairman of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America and is known for his ability to handle labor issues in the industry. He also served as the vice chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization when it was first established until last November, when he disagreed with Lewis, the chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, on the issue of Roosevelt's third term as president. When Lewis announced his support for Republican presidential candidate Willkie's election, he stopped working with him.</p>
<p>Colonel Knox, now sixty-six years old, was born in Boston and was originally the publisher of the Chicago Daily News. He was only a private in the Spanish-American War, then worked as a journalist, and later became the general manager of the Hearst newspapers. He served as the Republican vice-presidential candidate in 1936 and wrote a book in 1938 criticizing President Roosevelt's "New Deal," but when the situation in the European war worsened, he tried his best to advocate aid to Britain. He has maintained the title of reserve colonel since the last European war. He is of medium height, with sandy hair, hates official malpractices, and is decisive in his work.</p>
<p>Colonel Stimson, tall and taciturn, is now seventy-three years old and was originally a famous lawyer in New York. He served as Secretary of War during the Taft administration, Governor-General of the Philippines during the Coolidge administration, and Secretary of State during the Hoover administration. His political views are characterized by his firm opposition to Japan's expansion of power. His book "The Far Eastern Crisis" has the unique insight of a great politician.</p>

<h3>The Central Bank's Two Offices Were Tragically Bombed Yesterday; Both Bombs Were Delivered in Wooden Boxes; The Explosive Force Was Tremendous, Resulting in Eight Deaths and Over Thirty Injuries</h3>
<p>Fortunately, a Bomb at the China Agricultural Bank Did Not Detonate</p>
<p>Yesterday, from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, shocking news of the bombing of financial institutions spread within an hour. The targets were the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank at 439 Avenue Albert (now Avenue Ruijin Er), where seven people died and one was injured, and the Central Bank's office at 702 Jing'an Temple Road (now West Nanjing Road) in the International Settlement, where one person died and thirty-five were injured. Simultaneously, a bomb was discovered at the China Farmers Bank on Avenue Haig (now Huashan Road), but fortunately, it did not explode. This unprecedented bombing case is truly horrifying. Details have been investigated and are as follows:</p>
<p>Avenue Albert</p>
<p>The Tragic Bombing</p>
<p>Yesterday, at 3:50 PM, a timed bomb concealed in a wooden box was delivered to the reception area of the Central Bank's office on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. It detonated almost immediately with a deafening explosion that resonated far and wide. The bomb's destructive power was so great that it collapsed the staircase and part of the second floor. Upon receiving the news, the police swiftly dispatched a large number of detectives and police cars to the scene, temporarily closing off the surrounding traffic. They also urgently summoned the full complement of fire engines and ambulances from the Songshan Road Central Fire Brigade. Subsequent investigations revealed that eight people had been injured by the bomb blast and crushed under the collapsed building, with six dying instantly. One person died from severe injuries, and one sustained minor injuries and is currently receiving medical treatment at the Catholic Hospital. Among the dead was Chen Zongguang, the administrative director from Hangzhou, who had entered the building just minutes before the explosion and tragically perished. Another female victim was a family member of a driver on the second floor. Several of the dead were coolies who were in the process of moving the bank's belongings in preparation for its relocation. The perpetrators who planted the bomb had vanished without a trace beforehand.</p>
<p>Seven Deaths, One Injury</p>
<p>According to post-incident investigations, four messengers, Hua Baolin (from Shaoxing), Ji Asan (from Nantong), Zheng Guangcai (from Jiangbei), and Zhang Shiku (from Haimen), along with an electrician and Chen Zongguang (38 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 5 Hongren Lane, 398 Lafayette Road), the deputy director of the bank's administrative department, were standing outside the elevator door, intending to take the elevator upstairs. Unfortunately, they were all struck by shrapnel and fatally wounded. Qiu, the wife of Shan Alai, an electrician from Ningbo, and her younger sibling (20 years old), who resided in a small room on the second floor, were also victims when the floor collapsed. The younger sibling died on the spot, while Qiu suffered severe head injuries and died after being taken to Guangci Hospital. Another injured person, Xi Shuquanfu from Suzhou, suffered a leg injury that was not life-threatening and is currently being treated at Guangci Hospital. The police transported the seven bodies to the Taelstrasse morgue for examination today.</p>
<p>Further reports indicate that after the bomb explosion at the Central Bank on Avenue Albert, two senior military officers from a certain country drove to the scene around 5:00 PM to inspect the damage for about an hour before leaving in their original vehicle.</p>
<p>Jing'an Temple Road</p>
<p>A Wooden Box Delivered</p>
<p>The Central Bank had recently leased the second floor of the American-owned China Motors Company at 702 Jing'an Temple Road a month ago to serve as its Shanghai branch office. The entrance was through the back door of the China Motors Company, next to the back door of the Great China Theater on Biker Road (now Fengxian Road). Yesterday, at 3:52 PM, a man disguised as a mail carrier arrived at the bank carrying a wooden box resembling a soap crate, placed it at the entrance, and then left. The bank's clerks carried the box to the second floor and opened it, discovering a clock-like device with a pointer, its purpose unknown.</p>
<p>Sudden Explosion</p>
<p>They immediately telegraphed the police to report the situation. Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched two constables to investigate. Shortly after, a foreign officer arrived and identified the object as a timed bomb. As they attempted to move it, it exploded with a deafening blast, sending shrapnel flying in all directions, injuring thirty to forty people. The main door and glass display windows of the China Motors Company were completely shattered. It was reported that the cars on display were also damaged. At the bank's entrance on Biker Road, the main door and the interior of the second floor were severely damaged, with only the reinforced concrete pillars remaining standing. Fragments of glass, lead, wood, and plaster were scattered as far as the Southern Middle School and the sidewalks on the nearby roads. The glass on the side of the second floor overlooking the American Naval Club was completely destroyed, leaving only the steel frames. After the incident, the police dispatched a large number of officers to the scene to maintain order and close off traffic. The US Marines also arrived to assist with security. Red emergency vehicles were parked at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Biker Road, diagonally opposite the Fourth Joint Savings Society Bank. The injured were transported to the Baolong Hospital for treatment. Those with minor injuries were bandaged and discharged.</p>
<p>Hospitalized Individuals</p>
<p>He Jishi (50 years old, from Zhuji), Shen Kuilong (46 years old, from Huzhou), Zhang Zhaoxiong (30 years old, from Shanghai), Hu Dequan (41 years old, from Zhejiang), Wang Changhai (33 years old, from Changzhou), Zhao Songtao (50 years old, from Hebei), Lu Dexing (34 years old, from Ningbo), Zhang Rensheng (30 years old, local), Wang Bingjun (62 years old, from Jingjiang), Zhu Shouren (26 years old, from Xuzhou), Pan [blank]sheng (46 years old, from Shaoxing), Zhou Xingchu (47 years old, local), Xu Shaolin (46 years old, from Jiangsu), Hu Jifang (36 years old, from Shaoxing), Wang Zhenyang (56 years old, from Ningbo), Yan Jiahua (36 years old, from Jiangsu), Jiang Kechang (31 years old, from Tongzhou), Lu Shaogen (32 years old, from Pudong), Yang Yiming (22 years old, from Anhui), Lu Quanwu (50 years old, from Ningbo), Wang Zhongliang (29 years old, local), Xu Yinlin (44 years old, from Suzhou), Liu Peiquan (34 years old, from Changzhou), Zhang Ajin (36 years old, from Tongzhou), Wang Changfa (23 years old, from Nanjing), Li Xinglong (49 years old, from Hangzhou), Zhu Wenxiang (53 years old, from Ningbo), Li Changqi (37 years old, from Guangdong), Wang Lin (46 years old, from Hangzhou), Xu Shaobin (43 years old, from Hunan), Wang Fengguang (35 years old, from Guangdong), Gu Yueying (29 years old, from Guangdong). Additionally, Police Officer Wang Wenfu (53 years old, from Tianjin), badge number 375, was injured. Chinese Constables No. 2778 (seriously injured) and No. 2802 (minor injury) were stationed inside the bank by the police department. Furthermore, Wang Yunquan (46 years old, from Anhui), who worked in the document department, sustained fatal injuries and died at the hospital at 7:20 PM.</p>
<p>China Agricultural Bank</p>
<p>A Bomb Did Not Detonate</p>
<p>Yesterday, at around 3:30 PM, a person resembling a mail carrier carrying a heavy object weighing approximately 40 pounds delivered it to the China Farmers Bank near Avenue Haig and MacTaggart Road. The police, assuming it was an ordinary delivery, did not pay much attention. The person resembling a mail carrier entered the bank and placed the heavy object down before leaving. Bank employees, realizing something was amiss, immediately called the police, who dispatched officers to the bank to inspect the object. They discovered it was a heavy timed bomb. They immediately removed the clock's hands, preventing the bomb from detonating. The police then quickly and discreetly removed it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Blocked a Section of the Huangpu River to Secretly Load Wounded Soldiers for Repatriation; Two Passenger Ships Also Left Shanghai Last Week, Carrying Approximately Three Thousand Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>The American United Press reported that the Japanese naval authorities blocked the Huangpu River between the Riverside Power Plant and Wusong yesterday (March 23rd), prohibiting ships from passing through, to facilitate the deployment of five Japanese troop transport ships. This operation was completed by this morning (March 24th), after which the section of the Huangpu River was reopened. The details of the Japanese ships' loading operations remain a secret, but it is generally believed that the loading took place late last night or early this morning, and the ships set sail for Japan, carrying an unknown number of Japanese soldiers, as the size of the transport ships is unclear. It was also reported that two 8,000-ton Japanese passenger ships left Shanghai last Saturday, carrying wounded soldiers. It is estimated that approximately three thousand Japanese soldiers, likely wounded in the fighting upstream of the Yangtze River, boarded the two passenger ships at the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. wharf in Yangshupu.</p>
<p>Another Account: Troops Being Transported Elsewhere</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the Japanese naval authorities temporarily blocked a section of the Huangpu River yesterday (March 23rd), during which five transport ships arrived in port, apparently to load troops for transfer to other parts of the Far East. According to local yachtsmen and boatmen, the section of the Huangpu River from the Shanghai Power Company's Yangshupu Power Plant to Wusong was completely blocked yesterday afternoon. Pleasure boats and other small vessels were prohibited from passing the power plant.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai General Labor Union Offers a Loyal Admonition to the Communists; Unified Military Command is an Iron Rule for Warfare; Strive to Complete the Great Task of Resistance and Reconstruction as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union, due to the New Fourth Army's unlawful disobedience, which led to its disbandment by official order, and the Central Government's seven councilors' disregard for right and wrong and failure to attend the Second Session of the People's Political Council, along with their unreasonable demands to expand the dispute, sends a loyal admonition to Mao Zedong and the other seven councilors in Yan'an. The full text is recorded as follows: To Councilor Mao Zedong in Yan'an, and to Qin Bangxian, Lin Zuhan, Chen Shaoyu, Wu Yuzhang, Dong Biwu, and Deng Yingchao: The New Fourth Army's unlawful and disorderly actions in Jiangsu and Anhui are known and witnessed by the people of the north and south of the Yangtze River. The government's strict enforcement of military discipline and its disbandment of the army by official order are supported by the entire nation. However, you, gentlemen, are turning a blind eye to right and wrong, showing bias and partiality, using this as an excuse to refuse to attend the Second Session of the People's Political Council, and making various unreasonable demands in order to betray the promise made by your party in September 1937, causing pain to those close to you and joy to your enemies. We believe that a unified military command is an iron rule for warfare. What is the date today? How can we allow internal strife to reignite? You, gentlemen, are the outstanding talents of our time, and the people of the entire country look up to you. We hope that you will keep your promises and, under one government and one military command, strive for victory and complete the great task of resistance and reconstruction as soon as possible. With utmost sincerity, we humbly hope that you will take note of this. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Labor Union.</p>
<h3>Election of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council Postponed by One Week; Extensive Discussions are Underway; Hoping for Unified Cooperation Among Residents of all Nationalities; Making Shanghai an Oasis in a World at War</h3>
<p>According to a press release issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office yesterday, the election dates for the Municipal Council directors and the Land Commission, originally scheduled for April 2nd and 3rd, have now been changed to April 9th and 10th. This has been officially announced by the Consular Body leader, Mr. Hill. It is understood that the Municipal Council is currently exchanging views on the election issue with the British, American, and Japanese sides, a process that cannot be resolved within a few days. Furthermore, the deadline for submitting the list of candidates to the Municipal Council was previously noon on the 25th, and the annual election scheduled for April 2nd and 3rd was also fast approaching. Therefore, the Municipal Council suggested to the Consular Body that the election be postponed by one week to be held on the 9th and 10th. The Consular Body approved this suggestion yesterday morning.</p>
<p>The British and Americans Have Not Shown Signs of Concession</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, since the announcement of the Shanghai Municipal Council's decision to postpone the election date by a week, this period has become the most decisive time in the city's election history. During these seven days, the Japanese residents may be able to achieve their repeatedly failed goal of increasing the number of Japanese directors without voting through meetings and negotiations. This is because the British and American groups may concede one or two seats to the Japanese side, and residents of other nationalities may also seize the opportunity to gain a seat on the Municipal Council Board. However, prominent British and American businessmen told the Datong News Agency that they have not made any concessions in order to resolutely safeguard the rights and interests of their respective countries, so the aforementioned compromise cannot be confirmed.</p>
<p>The Scope of Negotiations Is Quite Broad</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the scope of the negotiations currently underway is larger than generally expected. To avoid the tension among residents of various nationalities caused by the upcoming Municipal Council election, and to prevent the recurrence of the shooting and riot incidents that occurred at the Special General Meeting of Taxpayers in February, the consulates of various countries in the city are carefully considering the current distribution of directors in the hope of finding a solution that is acceptable to both sides. All of the aforementioned solutions must be negotiated and resolved before April 1st. Candidate names from various national resident groups must be submitted to the Municipal Council before noon on that day.</p>
<p>Hoping for Shanghai to Become a Paradise</p>
<p>According to [blank], the purpose of this move by the relevant authorities is to make Shanghai a paradise in a world at war. The British, American, Japanese, and Axis powers all do not want to see more troubles here. To avoid disputes, the British and Americans, who have a dominant position in the Municipal Council, are prepared to make some "fair" concessions to Japan. However, they cannot compromise beyond this limit. The crux of the matter is that the two sides have not yet reached a consensus on "what is fair" and "what is unreasonable." It is said that the Japanese have long had the idea of circumventing this problem because they are bound to fail in the election. If the two sides can compromise, the Japanese will be able to gain more seats on the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Joint Cooperation Among Residents of All Nationalities</p>
<p>The scope of the current negotiations is not limited to the issue of Japanese directors. According to reliable sources, if the negotiations are successful, the large German community may gain a director's seat or a seat on the board. It is said that the relevant authorities have previously drafted a fair plan for the distribution of directors. When Mr. Nash, the Deputy General Manager of the Municipal Council, left Shanghai, he also published an article stating that if the Japanese can provide certain guarantees and make certain reforms in their area, the power of the Japanese in the Municipal Council should be expanded. To what extent the scope of the current negotiations is wide is currently unknown. However, one official said that the scope of the negotiations is "quite large." Whether the two plans mentioned above were discussed during the negotiations will be revealed soon. It was also said that Shanghai is an international city, and for the benefit of the entire city, municipal issues should be resolved in meetings.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Weekly Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club's weekly meeting is scheduled for noon on Thursday, March 27th. Senor Eduardo Esqinosa, the Acting Chargé d'Affaires of the Mexican Embassy, will give a lecture on "The Situation in Mexico." Members from Shanghai and other cities are welcome to attend.</p>
<h3>The French Power Company's Labor Strike Returns to a Stalemate; Work Resumption Failed Yesterday Morning; The Major Reason is Conflicting Views Between Labor and Management; Arrested Workers May Be Sent to Court</h3>
<p>The French Power Company's strike has now lasted for a week. Although the Political Department of the French Police Department has made every effort to mediate, the two sides have been unable to coordinate due to their conflicting views, resulting in the failure of several opportunities to resume work, declaring an end to illusions. Currently, the labor side wants to implement its demands, while the management side insists on its prejudices and refuses to give in. The future of the strike is increasingly deadlocked. The residents of the French Concession, who are suffering greatly from the prolonged delay, are all demanding that both sides change their attitudes and not disregard the welfare of society because of a dispute of emotions. The details of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Original Plan to Resume Work</p>
<p>After the labor side's failure to resume work on the 21st, the Political Department of the French Police Department temporarily suspended mediation. However, since it is a matter of great importance to the security of the French Concession, it was deemed inappropriate to abandon it. Therefore, although the 23rd was a Sunday, it still operated as usual, and at 4:00 PM that afternoon, it convened a meeting with labor representatives to frankly explore ways to resolve the strike and listen to more advice. After the labor side expressed its sincerity in resuming work, the Political Department guaranteed to the labor side that the minimum subsidy would increase from 18 yuan to 25 yuan, the allowance would increase by 10 yuan, wages would be paid as usual during the strike period, and the arrested workers would be released. The labor side immediately expressed its obedience, reached a compromise with the department, and agreed to start work again the next day (yesterday). The negotiations ended at 8:00 PM.</p>
<p>Failure</p>
<p>That night, the labor side sent personnel to notify the workers, instructing them to resume work on the 24th. At 7:30 AM yesterday morning, all the workers set off from Nanshi to the Luban Road factory site. At this time, the management had removed the iron fence and opened the gate. Two thousand workers entered the factory one after another, and the power generator was also turned on. However, since the management had not released the arrested coppersmith Ni Amao, the vehicles could not leave the factory to resume work. The labor side believed that this was in conflict with the compromise reached the day before and refused to resume work. The management also insisted on its opinion, resulting in the workers turning off the generator and dispersing. The scene of resuming work ended in illusion again.</p>
<p>Both Sides Insist. A reporter interviewed the Political Department of the French Police Department yesterday, which stated that the efforts had failed due to the insistence of both sides, which was a pity. It is now said that the department has suspended mediation. The reporter then visited the French Power Company, and the authorities were unwilling to express their views on the resumption of work, implying that they were not eager to resume work due to the current fuel shortage. They also stated that yesterday was the date for the workers to respond to their demands, but the labor representatives did not come, further complicating the strike.</p>
<p>Workers' Meeting. Yesterday, the French Police Department admitted to arresting a French Power Company worker, who will be brought to the French Concession court within days on charges of inciting the strike. All the workers are quite dissatisfied with this matter and insist that they will not resume work until the arrested workers are released. They have also scheduled an emergency meeting at the Dagil Road public sports field in Nanshi this afternoon to discuss countermeasures. According to general observations, the strike is unlikely to be resolved in the short term. The iron gate at Xieqiao, which was originally three doors opening together, had two of them locked yesterday afternoon, leaving only one door for entry and exit. Pedestrians and vehicles from Nanshi to the French Concession must undergo strict searches before they are allowed to pass through.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Belgian Ambassador to China, Mr. Guillaume, left Shanghai in mid-December of last year to go to Ping. After several months, he urgently wanted to go to Chongqing for official and private visits. He went to Shanghai to inspect the affairs of the consulate. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (March 23rd) on the Qingdao Maru of the Japanese Da Yun Steamship Company. He arrived at about 10:00 AM and went to the Cathay Mansions apartment on Baishi Road by car with the embassy welcome staff. The ambassador came to Shanghai alone this time. There were two secretaries who went directly to Chongqing from Ping the day before to arrange the residence for the ambassador to stay in Chongqing. It is said that the ambassador will have a three- or four-day meeting with friends and relatives in Shanghai before leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong and transferring to Chongqing to visit the central government officials. After the official business in Chongqing, he will transfer to Shanghai again for a longer stay.</p>
<h3>Two Employees of the Bank of Communications Kidnapped</h3>
<p>No. 13 Sanyi Lane, Jisi Feier Road, in the Shanghai Western Extra-Territorial Road-Building Area, is a dormitory for employees of the Bank of Communications. Suddenly, at about 11 o'clock late the day before yesterday, armed personnel broke in and kidnapped Liang Dianxiang (from Guangdong), an employee of the Nanjing Road branch of the bank, and Zhang Linzhe (from Suzhou), an employee of the trust department. After the bank employees who lived in the lane heard the news, they were all panic-stricken and fled.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain from Saigon Harbor Have Been Approved for Shipment to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The authorities in the Settlement were concerned that the frequent rise in rice prices was detrimental to the security of the Settlement. It was generally believed that in order to stabilize the food supply for the people, it was first necessary to punish rice speculators and smooth the source of supply to increase the stock. After actively trying to smooth the source of foreign rice, some signs have been obtained. In addition to negotiating for rice-loading ships, the governments of Saigon, Siam, Yangon, Hong Kong, and other places have also responded to Shanghai, approving the shipment of large quantities of foreign rice to Shanghai for adjustment. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce will facilitate the purchase of rice and grain in the area. It is understood that the authorities have separately notified the rice merchants to purchase in large quantities from foreign rice-producing areas within a time limit to be transported to Shanghai for adjustment and to increase the stock of food for the people. Yesterday, in the rice market, speculators tried to raise prices by taking advantage of the gold price fluctuations, but in the end, prices only rose slightly due to the continuous supply. It is expected that after the authorities announce measures to suppress rice prices, prices should fall further.</p>
<h3>Repeated Wars in Northern Jiangsu; A Large Number of Mails Returned</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been repeated and intense mobile wars in Northern Jiangsu, such as Taixing, Huangqiao, Hong Kong, Jiangyan, and Tianxing Port. The Shanghai Post Office received a large number of mails returned from the area yesterday, all stamped by the local post office with "The situation in the area is special and cannot be delivered."</p>

<h3>My Thoughts on Three-Three-Four (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Xifu</p>
<p>Halfway from the garden gate, an elderly Russian woman was slowly walking along, leading a child of three or four years old. Suddenly, the child wanted to walk and play on his own, so the old woman gave him a small iron shovel she had brought – likely her grandson or grandson – and the child started digging and shoveling randomly on the ground. I thought, when this child grows up, he will surely be another foreign hero who builds his own career from scratch. "Give them an iron shovel to start a business in China!" This educational slogan immediately came to my mind!</p>
<p>It wasn't a mirage. On a bench near the garden gate facing the Huangpu River, I spotted the Jewish man with the large leather bag again. What was strange was that he was chatting and laughing with another woman.</p>
<p>Crossing the tram tracks on the Bund, at the corner of the Palace Hotel on the main road, I saw a Jewish man selling postcards beckoning to me. He was selling colored postcards for one dollar and eight sheets, and Shanghai scenic photos for twenty-five cents and forty cents each. I spent forty cents to buy a "Bund Panorama" - see the illustration in this article - the original had a statue of Peace on the right side, which has now been cut off.</p>
<p>I asked him, "How long have you been in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>He said, "I came to Shanghai from Vienna two years ago." He was clearly an exile.</p>
<p>"Can you make a living by selling postcards?"</p>
<p>He told me that if it didn't rain and wasn't too cold, he could make a dollar or two a day, which was enough to get by. When he mentioned "cold weather," his less-than-fluent English couldn't strengthen his meaning, so he simply raised both hands to show me, describing the bitter suffering when the cold wind bites to the bone. I saw that he was wearing a raincoat, the material and color of which I couldn't distinguish under the sunlight, seeming to be composed of three natural colors: brown, yellow, and gray.</p>
<p>"How much money do you need to spend on living expenses each day?"</p>
<p>"I live in Hongkou, and the rent is sixteen yuan a month. Eating is very simple, about ten cents a meal."</p>
<p>"When is business the best?"</p>
<p>His face suddenly lit up. He pointed to the Huangpu River and then looked up at the opposite Cathay Hotel. Then he said, "When foreign ships arrive at the port, the passengers are my best customers."</p>
<p>He suddenly asked me, "Can you speak German?" I said I couldn't. After he explained the reason for asking, I just smiled and didn't take it seriously.</p>
<p>Finally, he told me that his name was Egon Eisner and thanked me for my patronage.</p>
<p>Separated from Eisner by a wall was the tea room of the Palace Hotel. Several seats by the window were filled with people sipping tea. The lake-green tablecloths, luxurious silver teapots, sugar bowls, ashtrays, etc., could be clearly seen by people walking on the street. There was also a melodious tune wafting out from the gaps in the window. Only when I walked to No. 15 Nanjing Road next door, in front of a flower shop, did I feel that I could no longer hear the music. Looking up, I saw a line of English words under the flower shop's sign: "Rose Lane."</p>
<p>What I was thinking was:</p>
<p>Three cents for a cup of black tea;</p>
<p>Three cents for a chocolate bar;</p>
<p>Four cents for a scenic photograph.</p>

<h3>Flour Merchant Pan Ruijie Escapes Kidnapping Yesterday Morning; Cabbie's Quick Thinking Locks Engine; Kidnappers Innocently Wound Victim with Gun</h3>
<p>Pan Ruijie, a native of Baoshan, 54 years old, is a flour merchant. He owns Ruiji Flour Shop at No. 122 North Zhejiang Road. He also built a house next door named Ruilu. He usually travels in his own car, license number 3524, with Wang Wenjun as his driver. Yesterday morning at 9:30, Pan took his car to Ruiji Shop. As the car arrived at the shop entrance, Pan was just</p>
<p>Stepping out of the car</p>
<p>When suddenly several kidnappers rushed forward, stopped Pan, forced him into the car, and drove away. At that time, the driver Wang Wenjun, seeing this situation, knew things were bad. With quick and nimble movements, he turned off the car's engine and took the key, jumped out of the car, and ran into Longji Lane opposite to the west. The kidnappers, seeing Wang escape from the car, knew they were exposed, so they also got out of the car one after another. One kidnapper fired a shot at Pan with a Mauser pistol,</p>
<p>Hitting his right ankle</p>
<p>The robbers then fled to the southwest. After the French Concession Police received the report, Hua Tantang Shang Wuhua, patrol officer Liu Yaying, and detective Zhao Ziduo rushed to investigate. They found a Mauser pistol shell at the scene. Because the injury to Pan was not fatal, he was still able to walk. An ambulance was called and he was sent to the hospital for treatment. Wang Wenjun and others were taken back to the police station to inquire about the faces of the kidnappers, in preparation for</p>
<p>Solving the case.</p>
<h3>Dozens of Coolies Snatch Flour; One Hundred Twenty Bags Robbed</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening at around 7:00 PM, a rice shop at a certain number on Dongxinju Street in the French Concession had hundreds of bags of flour piled up.

<h3>Zhou Jing, Prison Visitor</h3>
<p>Zhou Jing, the mother in the matricidal Zhou case on Sihai Ge Road in Shanghai, visited her two sons at the Tilanqiao Prison with her daughter Qin Zhu four or five days ago, after being acquitted by the court. Because she knew that her two unfilial sons had no hope of survival and would die sooner or later, she couldn't help but shed tears. They only talked for five minutes before parting.</p>
<h3>Shen Opera Actress Wang Yanqin Dies from Serious Stab Wounds</h3>
<p>Wang Yanqin, the daughter of Shen Opera master Wang Xiaoxin, 20 years old this year, has recently been filling in as the lead actress at the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Company downstairs in the New World Hotel on the corner of Yu Qiaqing Road and Nanjing Road, replacing Wang Yaqin. On the afternoon of the 23rd, she went to the Great World to play alone during her free time. She entered a cinema to watch a movie, and just after she sat down, she was suddenly stabbed in the neck by a thug in the darkness. The murderer fled the scene. Wang was injured and discovered by a waiter in the theater, who reported to the accounting room, who then reported to the police. She was taken by car to Guangci Hospital for treatment. All details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now heard that Wang died yesterday evening due to her serious injuries. The body is being held in the hospital morgue. The hospital has notified the police and will go to the morgue this morning</p>
<p>To examine the body. After the examination, the family will claim the body.</p>
<h3>Local Enamel Industry Temporarily Suspends Accepting Orders</h3>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Stepping Up in Turmoil; HSBC's Listings All Contracted; Buying of Sterling and US Dollars is Booming</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listings were sterling at 3/2/0625, US dollars at 5.1875. In the unofficial market for sterling and US dollars, prices continued to rise amid chaos, which was caused by a series of unfortunate events in the financial sector. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the French Concession would allow the use of a certain bank's banknotes from today, so short sellers were panicked and rushed to cover their positions, buying over a hundred thousand pounds in sterling and over a million dollars in US dollars. The foreign firms also settled their accounts, and it was rumored that American banks were also buying. Although HSBC and Chartered Bank supplied US dollars at 5.0625 and 5.21875 at times, and rumors of international tensions caused a slight pullback, speculators bought another 500,000 yuan after hearing the Central Bank had been bombed. In the end, the day closed at a tight price, with sterling at 3/2/203125 and US dollars at 5.21875, up .0625 and .125, respectively. The futures market followed a similar pattern. At the close, the four-month US dollar was difficult to settle at 5.1875.</p>
<p>Speculators Initiate, Foreign Firms Follow</p>
<p>In the early morning, the Shanghai to Sterling, to US Dollar, and US Dollar to Shanghai rates were all stable, with the US Dollar to Sterling rate unchanged and the US Dollar to Shanghai rate up slightly by a quarter. The Central Bank's listings for all rates remained the same. The banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning, with Sterling at 3/2/25 and the US Dollar at 5.3125, Sterling up .015625 and the US Dollar down .03125 from Saturday. After the opening, speculators were the first to cover their positions, and American banks also showed an appetite, causing the market to step up. HSBC announced its listings, with Sterling contracted by .0625 and the US Dollar also contracted by .1875. The silver equalization tax was announced as unchanged. Foreign firms then followed suit, with trades opening for the March and April US dollar at 5.25 and 5.2875, supplied by HSBC, Chartered Bank, and others, totaling five to six hundred thousand US dollars. By about ten o'clock, spot Sterling had softened to 3/2/203115 and spot US Dollar had tightened to 5.21875. Later buyers eased up, and foreign banks showed some willingness to sell at 5.21875, so the US Dollar pulled back slightly. At the close of midday, Sterling was still reported at 3/2/203125 and the US Dollar at 5.25.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Show Little Willingness to Supply</p>
<p>Speculators returned to activity in the afternoon market, and the market softened slightly, but soon turned flat as negative news from abroad, Shanghai Bank, the Mainland and Chartered Bank, and HSBC also released tens of thousands of pounds of March and April Sterling. The US Dollar was back from 5.21875 to 5.25. However, after 3:00 PM, when the Central Bank was bombed, foreign firms suddenly rushed to cover their positions, and the banks showed little willingness to supply, and the market was potentially tight. At the close, the spot Sterling was reported at 3/2/203125 and the US Dollar at 5.21875. The March rate was the same as the upfront price. The four-month Sterling was at 3/2/1875 and the US Dollar was at 5.1875. The result was a tightening of .0625 and a softening of .125 compared to the spot and futures rates at the end of last week.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Soars by Nine Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 25th (Monday) Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The London exchange rate and the Japanese exchange rate remained unchanged. The spot US dollar tightened by .0625, at 24.4375 yuan. The spot Shanghai exchange rate soared by 7 yuan, to 464.9 yuan (afternoon close on Saturday rose to 457 yuan). At 11:30, it was reported as flat. The spot US dollar softened again by .0625, to 24.5 yuan. The spot Shanghai exchange rate continued to rise by 2 yuan, to 466 yuan. The others were also unchanged.</p>
<h3>In a Chaotic Situation, the Gold Market Charges Wildly; High Point Seen at 6,720 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot market for gold was increasingly volatile. The violent attacks caused speculators to speculate wildly, and the rumors of a withdrawal shocked people. The market jumped to 6,720 yuan at the opening, which was inevitably too high. Major players took profits and dumped gold, and the exchange rate stopped tightening. The price fell to 6,600 yuan, and then to 6,570 yuan, where gold and securities firms bought, pushing it up by nearly 100 yuan. At noon, it was seen falling again. In the afternoon, the Pacific situation tightened, and the Shanghai Western Gang increased its long positions, and the exchange rate weakened again. The news of the Central Bank being attacked led to a resurgence of the rising trend before the evening close, and it rose to 6,680 yuan, up another 201 yuan. After the close, it jumped again to 6,720 yuan. The total trading volume was 78,000 taels. The sell-off of swaps (March to April) was offered at 50 yuan, but no trades were made. For cash, 20 taels were bought by a certain silver firm and 20 taels of Beijing Qingyun were sold by Tongfeng Heng in the afternoon. Silver firms also traded 20 taels among themselves, with prices all 250 yuan higher than the futures delivery price. The price of ornamental gold rose by 20 to 710 yuan. The price of Guanjin was not changed.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Soars by More Than 200 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, at around 9:00, the open interest market rose sharply, due to news that the exchange market was tightening. The short sellers were eager to cover their positions, and the market was firm. There were many buyers at the listed price (the opening price), but very few sellers. Later, the price increased by 5 yuan, then 10 yuan. The market opened at 6,700 yuan, 221 yuan higher than Saturday. In the chaotic situation, it rose again by 20 yuan, reaching 6,720 yuan. Very few transactions took place. The price was inevitably too high, and the exchange market had stabilized. The US dollar for this month could be settled again at 5.25, triggering the release of gold by major players. Dafeng, Hengji, Decheng, and Xiangxing Yong competed to sell aggressively. It soon fell back to 6,570 yuan. Later, the exchange market weakened again, and buyers resurfaced. Hengji was the first to buy again, followed by Yida, Xianghe, and Defu. It then rose again to 6,665 yuan. As the number of buyers decreased, the Shanghai Western Gang sold off its long positions. Tianyuan and Deda sold hard, and Shunyuan, Xinfeng Yong, Defu, and Gonghe also followed suit. By noon, it had fallen back to 6,600 yuan, but relying on Hesheng and Tongkang Yong to absorb it, it ended at 6,618 yuan. The market outside the exchange traded at 6,630 yuan after the close. The opening price in the afternoon was 6,625 yuan. Because of the many favorable rumors, plus the Shanghai Western Gang returned, Tianyuan and Litai bought 4,5000 taels, resulting in a rise to 6,670 yuan. Later, news of the worsening Pacific situation caused a sharp drop in buyers. Hengji, Xiangxing Yong, Xinfeng Yong, and Xianghe sold hard, causing it to fall back to 6,620 yuan. After 3:30, buying resurfaced. Hengji turned from selling to buying, and Shunyuan urgently covered its short positions. Yiyuan Gonghe also bought before the close, causing the price to rise to 6,690 yuan. The market closed at 6,680 yuan, up a full 201 yuan. At the settlement price of the April US dollar at 5.1875, it was 6,713.25 yuan, a premium of 33.2 yuan. After the close, because the four-month US dollar was difficult to settle at 5.1875, the price broke through the 6,700 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6,720 yuan. The price rose again, with a total fluctuation of 150 yuan for the day. The current brand gold from cash gold shops and retail prices was 270 yuan higher than the futures delivery price. The purchase price was 80 yuan lower than the selling price. There was no price or market for current brand gold.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Hangs High at 710 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of ornamental gold was raised by 20 yuan at 9:30. It fell back by 10 yuan at 11:00. It rose again by 10 yuan in the evening. The Datong Association changed its listing to 710 yuan. The listing for the new association was similar to the above price. The purchase price was about 30 yuan lower.</p>

<h3>Food Grains: Imported Rice Market Rose First, Then Fell Yesterday</h3>
<p>The market for imported rice was up in the morning, flat at noon, and fell sharply in the afternoon. The major players were taking advantage of the situation, claiming that the gold price was rising and the exchange rate was contracting (in fact, the gold price was falling and the exchange rate was rising, and the rice price should not have loosened), and because the market was closed the previous day, there was a lot of movement among the retailers and floating speculators. The spot price continued to rise by two or three yuan. As soon as the price was raised, the actual sales decreased, and floating speculators saw that there was surplus profit and took advantage of the high prices to sell. The merchants also pushed large quantities of spot goods, and the rising trend was thwarted. The results were all below the posted price. The Baixin Xiaowen price rose from 4,100 yuan to 3,900 yuan. The Zhongguan price rose from 3,800 or 3,900 yuan to 3,600 or 3,700 yuan. The No. 2 Saigon price rose from 3,700 yuan to 3,500 yuan. The No. 1 Saigon high-quality price rose from 3,400 yuan to 3,200 or 3,300 yuan. The Jue price rose from 3,200 yuan to 3,100 yuan or 3,000 yuan. Only the No. 1 Siam rice and Huojiao rice were less popular and there was little change, with prices always around 3,400 or 3,500 yuan. The Suijian price fell from 2,200 yuan to 3,000 yuan or 2,800 yuan or 2,900 yuan. The statistics show that prices rose and fell, but the Saigon rice prices in the afternoon were all 4 or 500 yuan lower, and there were few buyers. Therefore, although the prices rose by 3 or 4 yuan in the morning, the evening close was actually 3 or 4 yuan lower than Saturday's close. The total volume traded was more than 20,000 bags.</p>
<p>Large quantities of imported rice continued to arrive at the port. The Yihuo Company's Rigsdaal arrived two days ago (23rd), carrying 12,564 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at Roosevelt Wharf to unload. The Taikoo Company's Anhui arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday, also carrying 15,316 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at the company's wharf in Pudong to unload. The 2,000 bags of flour mentioned in the report yesterday that were shipped to Yantai were actually "Bao Mi" (corn), and the word "flour" was misprinted. This is a correction.</p>
<p>The thin and thick Japonica rice and other national rice, after a sharp sale before the week, yesterday, the first day after the holiday, caused the local retailers to take advantage of the low prices to buy, and the goods were sold smoothly. Also, because there were not many arrivals, there was a rumor of continued price increases for imported rice in the early morning. The owners were firm, and under the pressure, prices rose together. However, there were differences in the prices of the two Japonica rice. The price of the thin rice had already fallen sharply, so it rose more this time, by about two yuan. The opening price of Qingjiao rice was 114 yuan or 112.5 yuan for the thin rice, and 120 yuan or 119 yuan for the original package. The thick Japonica rice only rose by one yuan. The opening price of Changbang Japonica rice was 125 or 126 yuan for the special Japonica rice, and 123 yuan for the general rice. The Kunshan Japonica rice was 121 yuan for the white Japonica rice with high quality, falling to 117 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice was also actively traded, and because of the low prices, those who held the goods continued to raise the prices, and the market was firm. As a result, the Hong Kong special glutinous rice opened at 110 yuan, and the general cargo opened at 108 yuan to 106 yuan. The special glutinous rice tea even opened at 105 yuan, and the general price was 98 yuan for the entire grain, and 90 yuan for broken rice, a sharp increase of more than 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Still Speculating</h3>
<p>The flour market rose first and then remained flat. The rising trend was strong at the opening of the market. Because of the sudden rumors on Saturday, in the midst of rising gold and shrinking exchange rates, local retailers and speculators took the opportunity to buy, and the holders took the opportunity to speculate, with the Flower and Crow Clock Tower brand Australian flour jumping to 30.34 yuan, and the Golden Dragon brand Camp flour was 29.56 yuan, but in the afternoon it was suddenly reported that a large number of Camp flour had been imported, and after the rice price rose and then fell, the actual sales were sluggish, and the Flower and Crow brand returned to 29.8 yuan, and the Golden Dragon brand was also down by three or four jiao. The total transaction volume was more than 10,000 bags, and the market situation was gradually brewing. It is said that the situation will change depending on whether the arrivals are confirmed.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains sluggish. The arrivals from the inland areas have been scarce for a long time, and the supply in the market is limited. It can be said that there is a market but no goods. The price of high-quality Du wheat is currently around 45 yuan. Because the flour market is firm, the situation is stable.</p>
<p>Imported flour continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Anhui arrived at the port. In addition to a large amount of imported rice from Hong Kong, there were also 1,000 bags of flour. The Yihuo Company's Rigsdaal arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (23rd), and also loaded a large amount of imported flour, 18,964 bags.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Slightly Cheaper, Then Soars; Only Speculators Have Wolfish Nature</h3>
<p>The soybean oil market has been relatively stable recently, with each catty selling for a little more than one yuan, and raw oil selling for twelve ounces for one yuan. It is now difficult to make a living, and there is no choice but to choose the cheaper option. In this world, only speculators have a wolfish nature and are not afraid of bloodshed, so they are attacking soybean oil again. The buying interest in the market is strong, and general speculators are also active. As a result, spot prices soared by six yuan, and futures prices soared by five yuan. Factory oil rose by two yuan, while peanut oil changed little. According to statistics, 300 dans of factory oil from Dayou were traded, raising the price to 100 yuan. 200 barrels of Dalian oil were priced at 133 yuan to 135 yuan. A further 650 barrels were ordered for delivery in April, with prices ranging from 130.75 yuan to 136.75 yuan. In addition, more than 1,000 barrels were ordered for delivery in late April, with prices ranging from 135.75 yuan to 138.5 yuan. The transaction price for peanut oil was 4,000 cans of Jiangbei local mill-packed oil at 152 yuan, 200 cans of Yantai canned oil at 151 to 6 yuan, and 50 pieces of Yantai packaged oil at 114 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 25th, 150 bags of exported soybeans, 626 pieces of soybean cake, and 234 bags of sesame were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Securities - Attention to the Domination of the "Tong," "Ding," and "Du He" - External Stocks Rise and Immediately Fall</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for government bonds was extremely chaotic yesterday. Sentiment was still bullish, but the situation in Shanghai was unsettling, leading to selling at every high point, making support difficult. In this uncertain era, people are uneasy, and it's best to be calm and do less. Accidental losses would be a small matter. The Benxiong incident is a localized problem and shouldn't cause unexpected disputes, so government bonds are still stable. Yesterday's transactions included Xinfu buying in the morning, with Wenkanghong, Dada Tong, and Fengdelong also buying. Lianhe, Hengkang, Hu Heji, and Lemao were selling. Initially, Type C bonds reached the six-yuan mark and then rose steadily, eventually breaking through it, closing at six yuan and five jiao. The market outlook is promising. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to buy aggressively, paying special attention to Type D bonds, acquiring a significant amount. Other firms like Tongkang and Lianyi also showed strong buying interest. Type C bonds rose another one or two jiao at the opening, but then Renfeng, Hu Heji, and others sold heavily, while Lianyi offered substantial amounts of Type B and D bonds, causing the market to turn downward again. Type D bonds were supported by Xinfu, resulting in a rise of six jiao compared to last week. Other types fell back by about two jiao, except for Type A, which fell by five jiao and a half, suffering the most significant loss. The total transaction volume was 1.2 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Bank of Communications stock were traded at a price of eight yuan and one yuan. Huashang Electric shares were bid at eight yuan, one jiao and a half, but no sales occurred.</p>
<p>The public stock market opened strong but gradually declined. Jardine Matheson opened at 104 yuan and closed at 102 yuan. British American Tobacco fell from 30 yuan to 28 yuan and 75 fen. Jardine Estates fell from 45 yuan and 75 fen to 45 yuan. Only Taikoo Timber saw an increase, with morning transaction prices ranging from 52 yuan and a half to 53 yuan, and a sudden surge to 56 yuan at the close. Rubber stocks were ignored, and prices followed the decline of industrial stocks.</p>
<p>Wheelock, Marden &amp; Co., Ltd., will hold its 28th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on April 17. The net profit for 1940 was 600,000 yuan.

Registered shares will be paid upon presentation of dividend warrants sent from London, at the Shanghai, Tianjin, HSBC, Mercantile, and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger branches.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Actual Sales Stagnant - Yarn Market Unable to Rise Directly - Speculators Alone Shorting</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose and then stabilized, but the trend is firm with a soft underbelly. This is because actual sales are weak, so despite the surge in margin calls and the exchange rate reduction, yarn prices have not risen accordingly. However, after the exchange rate tightening, the factory's raw material prices are high, increasing costs. Therefore, some hoarders who have absorbed inventory are still unwilling to give up. Securities firms have shifted from short to long positions, but some in the industry, like XX, are shorting, intensifying the battle between the two sides. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,439 yuan, and the low price was 1,416 yuan. The initial transaction in the afternoon was at 1,416 yuan, then rose to 1,424 yuan, and then fell back to 1,417 yuan, with the final price at 1,435 yuan. Today, 555 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, and 165 bales were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning with enthusiastic sentiment. The opening price was 1,420 yuan, and soon fell to 1,417 yuan. Shortly after, it was heard that margin calls opened up at a jump of 200 yuan, igniting a buying frenzy in the market. Buyers were agitated, and the price immediately rose to 1,439 yuan. However, some profit-takers sold off, and the gold market eased slightly, causing the market to loosen and fall to 1,421 yuan. This trend recovered to 1,430 yuan, but the market wasn't smooth and fell back to 1,418 yuan at the close. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 7,450 bales were sold. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 160 bales</p>
<p>Counterparts: 7,250 bales</p>
<p>Southeast Asia: 40 bales</p>
<p>Total: 7,450 bales</p>
<h3>Cotton Sales Lively - Indian Cotton Arriving via Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains high due to the shrinking exchange rate and positive sentiment, but actual transactions have not fully developed. However, trading among industry players is lively. Yesterday, a total of 2,064 bales were traded, with prices up by one or two yuan. The current cotton market prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was calm and mixed. At the close, it fell due to selling by Southern firms, resulting in a decrease of three or four pounds compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was very flat, rising and falling by turns. Yesterday's closing prices showed fluctuations of about two rupees. It is predicted that today's opening price will rise by more than three rupees.</p>
<p>Also, according to a report from Bombay, from September 1st of last year to March 22nd of this year, Indian cotton...</p>
<p>Another report from Shanghai states that the trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is once again lively. Factories have been purchasing rapidly every day, and trading among industry players is even more active. It is expected that due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the surge in pure gold, and the rising trend in the yarn market, a competitive situation will unfold in the coming days.</p>
<p>The annual volume of Indian cotton imported into China is substantial, with most of it shipped from Bombay or Calcutta by British merchants. Due to the European war, the number of British ships operating on the Far East routes has decreased. A small number of central ships still operate, but only go as far as Hong Kong and do not come to Shanghai. Therefore, the shipment of Indian cotton to Shanghai has significantly decreased. However, Japanese merchants are purchasing and shipping directly via Japanese ships, with some being transported to Hong Kong and then transshipped to Shanghai. It is reported that Taikoo's Nanchang arrived the day before yesterday (the 22nd), carrying 7,437 bales of Indian cotton transshipped from Hong Kong. The Anhui arrived in Shanghai yesterday, also carrying 1,206 bales transshipped from Hong Kong. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Cloth Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market rose yesterday, influenced by the shrinking exchange rate. However, actual sales are stagnant, and hoarding has reached saturation, so the upward trend has become gradual. White goods and expensive fine cloth opened at 44 yuan and five jiao in the morning, and were transacted at 44 yuan and seven jiao and a half in the afternoon, an increase of seven jiao and a half per bolt compared to last Saturday. Other fine cloths and twills also increased by five jiao to one yuan. Coarse cloths from factories like Jardine Matheson opened at prices up two and a half jiao to five jiao. Bleached cloths and poplin were flat, while blue cloths and colored twills increased by five jiao. About 500 bolts of various cloths were traded on the street. Zhejiang and Fujian firms purchased over one hundred bolts of colored cloths and colored twills. Guangdong and Hong Kong firms purchased one hundred and several tens of bolts of broadcloth, serge, and blue cloth. Today, 410 bolts of piece goods will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 195 bolts will be shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>The East cloth market is rising, with fine cloths rising sharply by over one yuan per bolt. The afternoon closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth old warehouse orders surged to 49 yuan and six jiao and a half, and new machine orders were at 49 yuan and nine jiao. Four Gentlemen serge was at one yuan, one jiao, four fen and seventy-five, also up by a substantial amount of four fen per yard.</p>

The end-of-March forward contract was 85 yuan, six jiao, four jiao, with little change. The April 10th forward contract was 86 yuan, five yuan and seven jiao, six yuan and three jiao, up four jiao. The April 20th forward contract was 86 yuan and five jiao, seven jiao. Dutch red sugar was 67 yuan and five jiao, three jiao, up three or five jiao. Taikoo car white B Mark West warehouse was 86 yuan and seven jiao, then tightened. The East warehouse was transacted at 86 yuan and eight jiao. HX Mark West warehouse was 81 yuan and eight jiao, an increase of one yuan compared to the previous day (22nd). Recently, hoarders have continued to absorb sugar, so the market remains firm.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Wild Silkworm Silk Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Short-Lived Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>— Huanjun</p>
<p>Pulling a rickshaw is the most common occupation among the working class, with tens of thousands in Shanghai alone. They rely on their legs to make a living, running through the streets all day long, enduring the onslaught of severe cold and scorching heat, wind, frost, rain, and snow. They can truly be called extremely hardworking. Moreover, their eating, working, and sleeping schedules are irregular, and because of ignorance or lack of time, they almost never pay attention to hygiene. They often eat a full meal and immediately start pulling the rickshaw. Sometimes, they even stuff half a pancake into their mouths while a customer is calling, accepting the business and rushing off to pull the rickshaw. The intense strain is undoubtedly harmful to their gastrointestinal digestion, which is enough to shorten their lifespan. Therefore, rickshaw pullers rarely live long.</p>
<p>I have seen many examples of the short lifespans of rickshaw pullers. In the past, when I lived in the Nanshi area, I had three rickshaw pullers lodging one after another under the overhanging building at the entrance of the alley. None of these three lived to old age. The first one was only in his thirties. After pulling a rickshaw for two years, he pulled away his life. The second one lived to be just over forty. The last one to come and live there was a young and strong man, around thirty years old. He pulled the rickshaw as fast as flying, and he was very honest. People called him "A Geng." At the time, I thought that such a strong man would not have a short life. When I first saw him, he seemed as powerful as a wild bull. However, in less than two years, the work forced him to become a lazy, stove-hugging cat. When he pulled the rickshaw, he was as slow as he could be. In the fourth year, he eventually died of severe stomach disease. It is truly shocking that such a strong man only lived to be in his thirties.</p>
<p>This is a great tragedy in society. How should we save them?</p>

<h3>Night Walker</h3>
<p>— Cangzi</p>
<p>The darkness before dawn blankets everything on earth. Even the uneven cobblestone road made of countless fragments of stone slabs has lost its reflective properties. The night walker, without a glowing lamp in hand, walks his endless journey. Darkness is the vanguard of light, the night walker thinks. Perhaps thorns lie across the path in the darkness, and brambles recline. They will tear the night walker's clothes and even trip him. Of course, the night walker must pull aside the brambles or get up and continue his endless journey. He will not entertain for a moment the thought of "turning back" or "sitting here and waiting for dawn before continuing." Because he knows that if he has this thought in the darkness, it would be better to think of "suicide."</p>
<p>Everything must have a journey, and it will not be an easy one. When a baby is born, it must fight against cold, heat, hunger, and disease. As it grows, it constantly struggles against the shackles of social tradition and the constraints of life. When a seed falls into the soil, it must compete with birds, insects, and animals. As it grows, it is constantly exposed to the blows of wind and rain and the "torment" of frost and snow, which give it a chance of dying at any time. Therefore, the journey of anything is either a painful struggle or the pain of struggle. The growth of a new force will inevitably encounter the oppression and destruction of the old forces, and the betrayal and obstruction of rebels. His journey is formed in attack and sacrifice.</p>
<p>Everything must have a journey, and this journey is painful.</p>
<p>Humanity is divided into three teams on the painful journey:</p>
<p>One team is subjugated by the torment of pain and becomes captives and slaves of the oppressors.</p>
<p>One team is passive because of pain. The vast river will become their cemetery. Even if there are any left, they are undoubtedly "quasi-slaves."</p>
<p>One team is the fighters. Oppression cannot subjugate them, and pain will not drive them to passivity. Only struggle and progress, which they consider the only way to eliminate all difficulties.</p>
<p>Certainly, subjugation means destruction, and passivity is the knocker of destruction. Only those who fight are the victors of darkness and the masters of light.</p>
<p>The night walker wants to move from the path of darkness to the realm of light. He uses struggle as his weapon. But someone said: aimless action is a long march forever in the dark path, and it will not be able to absorb the nourishing air of light. That's right. But our night walker (that is, the fighter) has firm confidence and strong will. Isn't this his grasp? With this, he sees clearly the grain of each cobblestone. There will be no signs of "no passage." The night walker said so.</p>

<h3>The Power of Superstition</h3>
<p>— Luhan</p>
<p>Where I live is a building that is like a warehouse, like a hotel, and like an apartment. There is smoking, gambling, and... more than that, there is superstition.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of superstition is very strong here. Merit-making ceremonies, Taoist rituals, Buddhist ceremonies—everything is available here. Monks, Taoists, nuns, and Buddhist grandmas are employed here year-round. When someone dies in one house, they perform the seventh-day and eighth-day rites. When someone dies in another house, there is constant "ke-ke-dong-dong" from morning till night, making your head spin. All of this is nothing. What's more interesting is that there are taboos about everything, even though every household has a red paper sign posted on their door that says, "Grand Duke is here, no taboos." People are constantly violating taboos and running into bad luck. There are so many people running into bad luck here. For example, if someone delivering medicine "delivers the prescription and sends the medicine" to the wrong person, then that person thinks he has run into bad luck and insists that the person who delivered the medicine buy incense and candles and kowtow to apologize in front of everyone. Spending money and kowtowing, the person delivering the medicine is having bad luck, so he will not run into bad luck at his house. There is also a rule about drying clothes here: women's pants cannot be hung at the crossroads. It is said that walking under women's pants that are hanging up is also bad luck. This makes it difficult for women, because the drying platform here is only enough for the second landlord's family to use. A courtyard without a sky is a good place for dozens of families to dry clothes. This courtyard is the only way to go in and out, so water often drips on your head. Today, probably some clueless woman hung her pants in the courtyard. In less than five minutes, someone with a special interest in women's pants discovered it. It's terrible, the case is solved, scolding starts, and the whole warehouse is in turmoil. The pants were thrown away. Those who usually have a grudge against this woman do not want to let go of this excellent opportunity, seize her weakness, and start shouting righteously and menacingly, scolding the woman until she is covered in dog blood. Strangely enough, the woman, who is usually not very kind, knows that she is wrong today, hides her head in the house, and dares not come out, listening calmly to their challenges and never daring to reply. But I feel a little angry for the woman. Even if she is not convinced by the punishment of the law, she wants to appeal. Now, she has been convicted and punished by a baseless superstition, but she is obedient and breathless, not wanting to resist at all. Ah! The power of traditional superstition is stronger than the law.</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>Wandering in Loneliness</h3>
<p>— Manxiu</p>
<p>Mom was lying in bed, barely breathing. Mom said, "Xiu, I'm going to die! Make me proud!" I said, "Mom, don't worry! I will, I will definitely make you proud!" Mom nodded and told my sister, "You are the oldest. After I die, take good care of your younger siblings!" As she spoke, she looked at Dad and died with tears in her eyes!</p>
<p>Mom closed her eyes and died quietly! Leaving us three siblings, as desolate as an isolated island! Dad said we were too young, so he married a stepmother for us. On the day she entered the house, the three of us, wearing filial piety with shame, greeted the new mother. My sister and I both cried secretly! Dad looked at the younger brother in the nanny's arms and felt very uncomfortable. Later, my sister pulled Dad aside and said, "Dad! Don't forget our Mom!" Dad agreed! I said I clearly remember how we spent that night.</p>
<p>From then on, we had a "mother"! We waited for the "mother's" love and looked forward to the "mother's" care and comfort. We even hoped that one day we would forget our own mom! But we were very strange. Different moods created unavoidable conflicts, and the distance between mother and daughter grew wider. Dad's intentional flattery highlighted our sadness even more. After all, Dad is just Dad! We wandered in loneliness, we roamed in solitude, and we only looked enviously at our sister's happiness and the happiness of others.</p>
<p>My sister followed what Mom said on her deathbed and raised us. My younger brother is also jumping on the tram to go to school. Mom! I will, I will definitely make you proud!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(V) The Demarcation between Love and Desire</p>
<p>This signal was really effective, and a very light and lively footstep came out soon. After a while, the second gate opened, and standing on the stone steps was a young woman in cloth clothes and a cloth skirt, dressed exactly like a female student. A lovely and sincere smile floated on her face without powder. Who else could this be? Of course, it was Luo Xiangqi, whom Begonia had been thinking about all the time for the past two days.</p>
<p>"You're early!" She turned her body to the side, allowing Begonia to walk into the second door in a state of surprise and joy.</p>
<p>In the main hall of the second courtyard, there was a square table with a white tablecloth, on which was enshrined a memorial tablet and candlesticks and incense burners, which immediately reminded Begonia of what Xiangqi mentioned in her letter about her mother, who had been deceived and whose illness had worsened, causing her to pass away soon after.</p>
<p>Xiangqi led him into the side rooms on both sides.</p>
<p>"Would you mind waiting here for a while?" Xiangqi first asked him to sit down in a chair, then smiled slightly and ran into the back very lively.</p>
<p>Begonia tried his best to calm his mind and looked up to look around the room. It was a rectangular room, simply furnished but very clean. There was no air of wealth, only an ancient and quiet charm. On the north wall hung a narrow group photo. Begonia went over to take a look and knew that it was taken when Xiangqi graduated from the First Women's Normal School. The people in the photo were only the size of a finger, but in less than half a second, he immediately found Wei Xiangqi. He looked at that bean-sized face in detail and felt very familiar, as if this person had been living with him for more than ten years!</p>

<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>"The Spoilers"</h3>
<p>— Deng Shiying</p>
<p>Many people say the actors in "The Spoilers" are good. I agree. With the past acting skills of four "stars"—Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Claudette Colbert, and Hedy Lamarr—as a guarantee, it is reasonable to say that "The Spoilers" is worth watching for its acting.</p>
<p>But I think the excellence of the four "stars" themselves is secondary to "The Spoilers" becoming a good show. The most important thing is that the story of this show has broken away from the usual American movie love clichés, and the control of the characters has not harmed the show with people. —In the past, we have seen too many shows produced under the "star system" that killed the show and the "stars" themselves.</p>
<p>The "star" itself is not a sin. In Hollywood, the word "star" is at least built on acting skills; (it is far less so than in our Chinese film industry. After becoming a "star," he faces the crisis of being "restricted." The shows specially written for a certain star often kill the show and the star. One of the greatest benefits of "The Spoilers" is that the actors are not subject to such rigid restrictions. Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy both fit their characters. Although Hedy Lamarr does not have many scenes, she gives us a strong impression due to the director's proper handling. Claudette Colbert is relatively wronged. Although her "good wife and mother" is very energetic, it is inferior to her several previous comedies.</p>
<p>"The Spoilers" has a very moving story. Two muscular, brave, and irritable men fall in love with the same woman. When one discovers that his friend's wife is the lover he has been missing, he silently endures the pain and retreats. Later, he fought with his friend for the happiness of his lover, but when his friend's career failed and he was almost imprisoned after bankruptcy, he stood up to testify to acquit his friend.</p>
<p>In the production of the script, the author broke away from the usual American film handling of love, but the arrangement of the scenes was not appropriate, and even seemed a little disorganized and jumpy. The reason is that the material was not well woven, so that at first glance, there is a lot of material and complicated plots. This is "business material" in our Chinese films, but it has made the screenwriters suffer in American films that advocate simplicity.</p>
<p>"The Spoilers" is adapted from the novel by James Edward Grant. I don't know how the original work is. In retrospect, the somewhat chaotic scene arrangement may have been influenced by the chapter divisions of the novel; therefore, the author's cleverness is shown in the dividing shots. The example of knocking down three hooligans and putting them together, as well as the appearance of Hedy Lamarr after the two people fought (using close-ups when the two are fighting is also a very clever method). In addition, the use of small objects to regulate the air in the passing scene, so that the play does not fall into dullness, are all examples.</p>
<p>"The Spoilers" is a play I like.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter III Recalling Lord Pingyuan</p>
<p>So Li Xin, Zhang Cangqiu, Chen Fei, and Xu Jing all drank the cup of wine in front of them, which shows that everyone agreed. Li Xin was very happy and asked his family to prepare everything. After the banquet, everyone sat and talked for a while, and before they knew it, it was late. However, sacrifices and idols had already been prepared in the hall, incense and candles were lit, and the ground was covered with red felt. Li Xin and his men first paid homage to heaven and earth and wrote a list of sworn brothers. Zhang Cangqiu was older and the eldest brother, Chen Fei was the second, Li Xin was the third, and Xu Jing was the fourth. After greeting each other, everyone called each other brothers. Li Xin then invited his wife, Xing, to come out and meet them, and the servants also came up to congratulate them. Several of Li Xin's retainers also came to congratulate him. Li Xin held a grand banquet in the hall, inviting his three brothers and retainers to drink together. The servants were also rewarded, and the festivities lasted until midnight before dispersing. That night, Zhang Cangqiu still followed Xu Jing back to his residence and agreed that Chen Fei would set off the next afternoon. Li Xin and Xu Jing also planned to hold another banquet in the village to see them off. The next day, Zhang Cangqiu got up at dawn and talked with Xu Jing for a moment, saying that if they made meritorious service and were promoted there, they would ask someone to send a letter back. Zhang Cangqiu wanted Xu Jing to go outside as well. However, Xu Jing regretted that he could not follow because his old mother was still alive. After breakfast, Zhang Cangqiu went to bid farewell to his mother, gave Liu San several taels of silver, and then put on his precious knife and carried the parcel that had already been prepared. The four of them talked for a while, and the sun was already at noon. Li Xin and Xu Jing, as the hosts, set up a banquet to see the two of them off. Everyone drank heartily. After the banquet, Zhang Cangqiu was ready to leave immediately. Li Xin, because Chen Fei did not have a mount, took a green horse from his stable and gave it to him, and also presented two hundred taels of silver to the two sworn brothers as travel expenses. The two of them were not polite and accepted them all, bid farewell and left. Li Xin and Xu Jing each rode a horse and saw them off for more than ten miles before reluctantly saying goodbye. Li Xin and Xu Jing rode back to Li's Manor. As they approached the gate, they saw a large group of people gathered on the square over there, with gongs and drums sounding, and they didn't know what kind of tricks they were doing. Li Xin's manor had never allowed people from the Jianghu to sell their fists and arts there. If he wanted to give them some money, he would be willing to, but he would not allow exceptions. So, when he saw this, he felt a little annoyed, spurred his horse and went to the crowd.</p>
