<h3 id="c10">關於三強會議 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>將在莫斯科舉行的三强會議，自羅邱會談結束後，久久未見實施，前且曾傳有展期舉行之說，切盼民主國家聯合行動早日實現的人們，不免感覺觖望。昨據華盛頓消息：以哈利曼任主席的美代表團五人，不久將首途莫斯科，同時英內閣供應大臣皮浮勃洛克，不久亦將率領代表團前往蘇聯，會同討論英美兩國共同援蘇問題。正當蘇軍加緊反攻之際，這一會議的展慕，無疑將在精神物質雙方予蘇軍以莫大支援，並促進反侵略戰爭的發展。</p>
<p>蘇德戰事的爆發爲新的國際局勢的起點，而民治國家與蘇聯間的合作則爲撲滅侵略罪惡的要着。遠束與歐陸戰爭烽火的爆發，多少都是利用了民治國家與蘇聯之間的隔閡，時至最近，納粹猶且想藉攻蘇一舉結束英德間的敵對，因爲這些往事的敎訓，創痛鉅深，世人乃轉而殷切期望已往隔閡的化除，聯合作戰的實現。以是當三强會議消息傳布之初，無不深致其熱烈的期望，盼其在原則上能夠成立從政治軍事以至經濟方面的廣泛合作，在區域上不只注意歐戰更須顧及遠東，而且爲了使這一反侵略合作發揮充分效果，中國的參加更屬必要。</p>
<p>當羅邱會談之後，英美雙方對於援蘇措施都曾加以重大的注意，諸如美油船的駛蘇，英蘇間的貸款，均已先後實現。不過關於更進一步的合作問題，除於進兵伊朗一役微見端倪而外，始終遲遲無所進展。至於舉世矚目的蘇京會議，據八月廿一日路透社的倫敦消息，曾指明其任務爲不稍延宕而予蘇聯以可能範圍內之最大援助，其所討論亦將以物品與接濟爲限。就英美雙方所派首席代表人選來看；美國是負責對英實施租借法案的哈里曼，英方是供應大臣皮浮勃洛克，都正是負責處理物質接濟的人物，則上述路透社消息所指出的會議任務，可信與事實不甚相遠，其範圍實遠較日前世人所期望者爲狹小。關於物資支應問題，在今日戰爭中固佔最重要地位，如美國且曾以民治國家的兵工廠自居，自不容加以輕視，而其他方面—尤其是軍事上的密切合作，却更是今日更急迫的根本問題。</p>
<p>納粹於對英戰事停滯之際轉而攻蘇，在理論上是冒着兩面作戰的危險，其實在西綫佔領區內僅留相當防禦兵力，陸空主力，均用於攻蘇，並未眞正遭遇到兩面作戰的困難。蘇聯的英勇抗戰，至今堅强尤昔，即在英美當局，也都相信其至少在明春以前不致遭遇重大挫敗，自不虞重蹈歐戰初起時波蘭因西綫聯軍按兵不動而致敗亡的覆轍，但是，聯合反攻遲延一天，就等於侵略慘禍多延長一天，在蘇德戰事猛烈相持之下，納粹未必不別謀冒險求逞之方，這是不能小急求所以遏止之道的。英軍的反攻配備，也許還未屆完成，但經過年餘的準備，較之歐戰初起時的倉皇赴戰，巴爾幹戰事時的赴援希臘，當已堅强數倍，在整個的歐陸未必就絕無伺隙蹈瑕之方，這是英蘇之間所急待協商從事實施的。</p>
<p>納粹在歐陸固然尙未遭遇兩面作戰的困難，今日的蘇聯却正感受着這樣的威脅，英軍上陸反攻的呼聲與可能，實遠不如日本之於北進，以此之故，蘇方乃不能不留駐數十萬大軍在遠東以備不虞，另一方面，也就是無形削弱了西綫抗德的軍力。遏阻太平洋危機爆發之道，自莫過於中美英蘇以至荷印等邦的共同合作，而在戰略意義上，蘇聯的遠東領土實更具有非常重要的功能。現在南太平洋ABCD的聯合陣綫固已形成，北太平洋却還留有重大的空隙。固然，日本而果眞北進侵蘇，響應納粹，自爲民治國家所不能容忍，而於如何善制機先之道，則迄今尙無所講求，這不能不算是反侵略陣綫的一個重大遺憾。</p>
<p>諦視近半月來的國際動態，在三强會議消息沉寂的期間，也就正是美日接洽頻繁的期間，而最近美日關係無所進展，三强會議亦復宣布即將舉行，也許是時間上的巧合，但却不能不使人聯想到是英美的對日有所顧忌。假如事實眞是如此，實爲英美的重大失策；抑制遠東危機之道，不在於如何袪除日方的不安，而視乎有無政略戰略上的制勝把握。現在伊朗戰事已告結束，經過宗谷海峽以達海參崴也許並不是美國戰具運蘇的唯一重要通路，但是這一此較供應戰具倍形重要的中美英蘇在遠東共同合作問題，却不能不望於三强會議召開之際另予以密切的注意。</p>

<p>按房屋估價分甲乙兩類　預計每年可收七百萬元</p>
<p>獲致厚利營業理應繳納更多之捐稅</p>
<p>工部局於前日（三日）下午四時三十分、在會議室舉行暑期休假後第一次會議、除討論若干例案外、　討論「硏究新稅源」委員會建議、擬於明年一月一日起、征收營業房屋「特別房捐」　案、略加審議後、即照原案通過、前後僅費半小時、嗣出席諸人、復與工部局總辦費利溥略事寒暄、於五時二十分散會、各方注目之徵收營業房屋特捐案、遂吿完全決定、工部局情報處曾於昨日下午、發表公報如下、</p>
<p>按照　屋估價征捐</p>
<p>據工部局情報處發表、本局前據「硏究新稅源」委員會建議、對於營業房屋征收「特別房捐」一項、經提付七月廿三日例會初步審查、並議決將本案發交財務委員會予以覆廣議、該委員會旋於八月十八日開會、通盤硏究、結果决定向本局建議、謂一俟　詢正在設置之「　詢委員會」以後、本局應即對於各種工商業用以及爲專門職業所占用之房屋、按照房屋估價、開征特別房捐、此種房屋、擬分爲甲乙兩類、</p>
<p>征捐房屋分爲兩類</p>
<p>屬於甲類之房屋、（純粹作爲住宅之用、及臚列於乙類者除外、）包括寫字間·商店·當舖·工廠·倉庫·碼頭等等、按其房屋之估價、每年征收特捐百分之八、屬於乙類之房屋爲證劵·金業·及物品交易所、按其房屋之估價、每年征收特捐百分之十五、案經本月二日提出討論、當經議决、准如上開分類辦法、開征「營業房屋特捐」、並得在徵詢「　詢委員會」之意見以後、更加考量、上項特捐、擬自、九四二年一月一日起開始征收、估計每年可收七百萬元左右、</p>
<p>甲類負擔已予减輕</p>
<p>據大中社記者探悉、「硏究新稅源」委員會、原擬甲類按照房屋估價三千元以下者、征收一成四分、超過三千元者、征稅一成、乙類在三千元以下者、征稅一成、三千元以上、征稅八分、嗣經財務委員會覆議結果、認對資本較大者、稅率本妨略高、對資本較小營業者、自應予减輕、遂修正爲甲類一律征收百分之八、乙類一律征收百分之十五、　詢委會人選在銓衡中、大致爲十六七人、預定本月中旬或可成立、由工部局將此項增稅案、交付審議、徵求各方意見俾於年內籌備竣事、於明年起開征、</p>
<p>兩租界內稅則差別</p>
<p>字林報云、消自靈通非官方人士昨稱、工部局建議、乃照法租界收稅辦法加以修改、而將營業與職業分類、法租界之稅、係向營業職業與工業徵收、而以其佔用房屋之估價爲根據者、分爲兩類如下、甲一切營業·商店·工業·工廠·倉庫·及除乙類所指定者以外之貿易、（乙）銀行·經紀人·金融公司·地產公司·收租經紀處·商業經理處·律師事務所·與保險經理處等、屬於甲類者、其佔用房屋之估價在二千四百元以下、徵收百分之八、超出此數之估價、徵收百分之六、最少爲每年五元、屬於乙類者、其佔用房屋之估價在二千四百元以下徵收百分之十二、超出此數之估價、徵收百分之十、最少爲每年十元、</p>
<p>征稅比率有所討論</p>
<p>至於公共租界所以徵收之營業稅、雖仍在硏究階段、然公衆與非官方人士對於徵收此稅之若干種營業與職業一　、已紛加討論、且致函報紙、表示各種意見、認爲若干種營業能較他業繳納更多之捐稅、尤以中日開戰以來獲厚利之營業機關爲然、關於收稅問題、工部局亦已組織委員會、委員皆係主要商人與律師、於詳細調查局勢後所發現者、對於局方有極大之襄助、</p>

<p>據大中社記者昨日自銀行界方面所得可靠消息、平準基金委員會美籍委員福克斯、雖尙未返港、但於美幫辦泰萊及花旗麥加利兩行總理經麥凱霍金士抵港後、與中國委員陳光甫淞蓀席德懋間、對管理滬匯市問題、連日均有非正式會議、英籍委員霍爾巴樞、一日晨乘美郵船茄菲爾總統號南下、亦已於三日抵港、參加討論、會議目的、即就平準會旣定政策、與外商銀行建議中、覓一澈底有效辦法、預料週內必可吿一段落、在下週作最後決定、</p>
<p>煤油結款尙可購匯</p>
<p>匯豐·麥加利·有利·花旗·大通·五銀行、於二十九日起、停止黑匯掛牌後、黑市活動、即大受限制、以香港會議結果如何、一時尙無法判定、風險旣大、投機者遂無所施其技、現有買賣、大抵爲銀行吸進少數出口匯票、供給若干汽油煤斤結款、截止昨日、始終停止黑市買賣者、僅匯豐一家、前昨兩日未做此項交易者、爲有利一家、麥加利前日雖接奉該行總經理霍金士自香港來電、囑令停止黑市買賣、但僅施行一日、於昨晨起、恢復原狀、但範圍甚小、限於將當日所吸進之頭寸予以出售而已、至花旗大通情形、亦大致彷彿、</p>
<p>黑匯前途已難猖獗</p>
<p>至黑市前途、將來是否能趨於消滅、據外　商銀行方面觀察、黑市範圍可被限制至極小範圍、但不致完全消滅、據稱、經平準會核准　新匯北供給者、非英鎊集團如荷印輸滬之米、現亦有一二批、美棉最初可核准、近日亦不許、由馬尼刺運滬之柳安木、亦有被核准者、平準會對此種申請、似並無一成不變之標準、蓋就情勢發展隨時變更、旣非貨物來自英美者盡可核准、亦非英美兩國以外之進口貨、絕對不許、在此種情形下、一部份進口貨物、乃不得不仰給於黑市矣、</p>
<p>金市結價標準決定</p>
<p>自黑匯停止掛牌後、標金期貨交易、以結價失去標準、停止已多日、雖經迭次召集會議、以多空雙方發生爭持、一主依照黑市匯率結價、一主照平準會規定之匯豐掛牌結價、未有結果、迨至前日下午、經紀人會議始有決定、決就匯豐掛牌與當日黑市匯率折中平扯、作爲每月底結價新標準、仍按月於十四日照當舉行掉期、因結價問題解決、故標金市塲、已於昨日起恢復期貨交易、聞經紀人會議所作之決定如下、</p>
<p>今後標金交易、可以美元·英鎊　香港票·美金票·現金·等八種、作爲保證金代用品、至正當價格、決由經紀人四十名上、選出委員八人決定之、　標金結價、決照匯豐掛牌及黑市匯率折中計算、</p>

<p>厚薄粳雖以出新愈迫、本應行市回小、然爲不得搬運來滬、故商販猶敢奇貨可居、惟連日受洋米猛跌影響、本鄉店胃頓滯、貨主難以扳持、售價並落二三元、開南港早稻百五十七元百五十五元、無錫特粳百五十四元、大市百五十元、百四十八元、浦東新粳亦然如是、朋百五十七八元、特別百六十元、糯米際此疲檔、去路亦淡、故價一致趨跌貶短元砠、開香港白元高自百廿五元次至百十八元、特別百廿七元　菉百十一二元、</p>

<p>昨日菜油及棉子油疾退狂升、變化愈大、初因空頭集團仍居優勢、賣氣經盛、開後行情即被抑小五元至八元、旋以多頭集團亦漸起活動、致巿勢頓止跌回昂、下午時某方宣稱統制各產地棉籽、因此人心震動、廠方與拋空者羣相進補、買風空前、行情乃急遽直錢上漲、結果比上日反軋升六七元、統市售開大有廠淸油達一萬多擔、日華廠菜油七千餘桶、又靑島生油略有零星做開價爲二百七十二元至二百七十五元、江北聽生油二百五十六元、</p>

<p>雙馬晨開市態平庸、首盤價爲一千七百零七元、少頃升至一千七百零九元、但新買者寥寥無幾、二則大都不能到市塲、交易較爲减色一步、跌至一千七百零一元、繼後聞取引所開市有升有降、人心平澹、在此一千七百零六七元廻旋多時、迨至二盤取引所回振、人氣激動、買者活動、絡續而升至一千七百十六元、但現紗交易寥落甚稀、以致廠單文爲乏勁、迨至取引所收盤紗市仍昂、惟拍至標布遠月轉下、雙馬隨之鬆懈、至一千七百十一元收盤、以後續小一二元、查半日間成交統計五千一百十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>滬仆棉交易、巿况熱閙、貿易特盛、良以各方需貨殷切、而現棉情况一再緊俏、同時直接訂購美棉、畢竟較現貨便宜良多、蓋爲美印與中國站在同一方面、中國商人購美印棉、自易請得外匯、惟上海情形特殊、深恐以購得之美棉、大做其「毛延壽」流落他方、轉非所以維持紗廠業之道、故申請外匯手續、自需嚴格審核、並須切實保證所購外棉不得轉售、奈上海環境監察匪易、一方面爲愛護工業、予以便利、一方面　中侔利、防不勝防、因之連日　外商棉業洋行之定貨交易、熱鬧再達頂點、事實上多爲廠方購進、以其直接消費、故爲花號家所望塵莫及、綜計咋日各外商棉業所售出之巴西棉及美加州棉、總數似達二千包左右、花號家僅佔十之一二元、預料因船期抵滬日近、同時售價僅爲現棉四分之三、此後數日內將更見猛烈競爭之局面也、</p>
<p>紐約的棉市、先因氣候報吿不利空頭、及棉產收獲情形不良而漲、同業買價與經紀商較活潑、但後略因一部分獲利了結而跌、結果收盤價格較之上日約漲十二至十六磅音左右、</p>

<p>— 霖長</p>
<p>「鬎鬎即孩子自家的好。」句至理名言，可以表明天下的父母之心。孩子們本來是「善」的，盧梭說·「孩子們沒有道德上的惡。」父母愛之，正是出乎天性。</p>
<p>目前孤島生活如此艱辛，一班經紀人有上偌大的負但，自然時時不舒適，他們在家裏更會發洩出來，會怪自己的家屬，恨兒女太多。他們很能想出一種理論來調侃着：以爲手邊有兩千塊錢，就比個孩子好。孩子呢，要吃，穿，用，更要敎育，這負担眞重。但偶而他們太煩惱時，一見孩子牙牙學語，婆娑而舞，就竟會把難過拋向九霄。孩子有病，更會急得焦頭爛額，惝恍不安，要孩子病好，雖費十萬阿睹，亦所不惜，自己窮到告狀倒無所謂。－這種「萬事足」心理從那裏來？天性而已。我們粗看以爲滑稽，以爲有點「想不穿」；但細細一想，確有一種啟示，使人肅然：一家族綿延，一民族無窮，都建築在這天性上。</p>
<p>天下無不是父母。敎養孩子，原是天職，毫無功利可言。爲了孩子的生存使自己犧牲，在世界上千千萬萬；爲了一己的享受，要孩子滅亡，實在少有。</p>
<p>有之，那是做父母發了瘋。人們與其憐憫其生活的境遇，不如痛恨其愚蠢的行動的好。孩子們有他未來的奮鬥的權利，自己慚愧不能好好地生，何必要孩子苦苦地不活。敎養若干時期讓孩子自己去吃苦，創造，社會才有進步，這敎養問題，還是起碼條件，一個勤奮家旗，咬　牙關吃苦，而眞個沒有粥吃，我也不敢相信。</p>
<h3 id="c82">傷寒·勝家·亞爾西愛 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 鍾文苓</p>
<p>預算緊密不免如此超出　維他命M可換維他命C</p>
<p>當我們想到稍爲一點物質的享受，也許會使我倆的小家庭更顯得可愛些。便決定實行一個二年計劃，從每月的收入中提出百分之五儲存起來，預備在二年之後，便可以購買兩樣挺可愛而足以增加我們快樂的東西——一座小巧的亞爾西愛和一架漂亮的勝家縫紉機；前者是我夢魂縈繞之物，後者也是挺渴望的。</p>
<p>計劃進行得非常順利，這筆款子的數目逐漸地加大時，我們的欣悅也跟着增加。眼前映着的是一幅行將完成的家庭之樂圖，——在收音機所發出的曼妙的音樂之下，姐在縫衣，郞在讀書。</p>
<p>然而意外的事情到底是難以臆測的。戰事的爆發給我們一大打擊：薪水雖然說是加過二次，但是和在漲暴跳的物價比較起來，還是相距那麽一大段。所以每月總覺着有些入不敷出，捉襟見肘的情形，於是此時此地每一分錢都有它非常的用處。</p>
<p>最初受到困逼滋味的一個月，曾經想動用那筆款子，然而當想及這是多時的心血時，便終於忍受下來。艱苦地捱過了一個月，以後就算再困些，也不再轉這種念頭了。</p>
<p>雖然我們決不會在這種時候花錢去買非所必需的東西，然而總覺得和這兩件東西有一些藕斷絲連的關係，因爲我們到底還有一筆錢。</p>
<p>不知道的珍兒患了病，延醫診治的結果：說是傷寒症，不能動，需要慢慢地調養，半點渣滓都不能進口，吾則，馬上吿一段落，最好還是用花旗蜜橘搾了汁喝。我們知道花旗橘子的價錢一定很貴，不過大概是愛子心切吧，我們都馬上想到用　筆款子作爲珍兒的醫築和養費。</p>
<p>從頭對於水果店雖然難得光頋，可是也知道，那時，譬如你買花旗橘子吧，現是問多少　一磅的，假使你問一隻買　的話，便有些寒酸相了　大跑進去，自然也問多少錢一磅，回答的却是：這種一元　角一隻那種一元六角。我想店夥以每隻的價格回報我，大概不會瞧我買不起吧？因爲我剛剃過頸，而且身上穿了一件印度綢，自問容光也有一些煥發的樣子。爲了珍兒就算再貴些也要買，旣然抱了必買之心，再帶三分報復的意味，挺一挺胸，響亮地說：大的，一元六角一隻的，給我十隻！</p>
<p>如是，珍兒每天吃五至六隻橘子；維他命C充分的補養之下，病不久便好了。然而從此我們和勝家與亞爾西愛間的曖昧關係，也就一筆鈎銷。</p>

<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>中國道士本出於巫，然自佛敎入中國，以佛經之深玄廣博，頗得士大夫階級（亦可謂知識階級）之信奉，於是中國之道士，竊取其形式，從而爲餓鬼施食，攘和尙之生意，即水火煉度是也。</p>
<p>並以佛敎有救苦救難之覜世音菩薩，道敎乃亦有太乙救苦天尊。和尙近已不少而爲「胡鬧」，而道士中之胡閙，乃有甚於和尙，甚至藉絲弦之助，歌小調，唱淫辭，此亦豈爲取悅於鬼神之道耶！但七月十五日之爲中元節，則出於道敎。道敎崇祀三官大帝，而以正月十五日爲上元節，七月十五日爲中元節，十月十五日爲下元節，唐宋時代，張燈供養，所以崇奉之者甚，而七月十五日之爲中元，以其爲地官，故超度亡魂。舊時一年三節之城隍會，祭祀泰厲壇，亦爲超度無祀孤魂，其用意固與燄口施食相近。城隍會中嘗見有奉旨祭祀孤魂（原文不能記憶）之高脚牌，此奉旨二字，據謂奉明太祖之旨。因明太祖之父母死亡，不知葬身何地，乃於洪武三年定制祭泰厲壇，以淸明日及七月十五日十月初一日行之。先期七日，檄城隍（此奉旨二字之由來）。祭日，設城隍神位於壇上，無祀鬼神等神位於壇下之東西，羊三，豕三，米三石，以爲祭。降及後世，徒爲形式，數典忘祖，習俗所見，又豈止厲祭之一端哉！</p>
<p>然何以斷章取義，不曰盂蘭盆會，而曰蘭盆勝會，此則叉爲中國文士之積習，但知文字美麗，不顧意義如何。盂蘭本係譯音，理難分割，然偏去其盂，獨留其蘭，蓋以蘭盆二字尙覺典雅也。歲華紀麗云；。「道門寳蓋，獻在中元。，釋氏蘭盆，盛於此日」。意即蘭盆勝會四字之濫觴歟！</p>

<p>— 慕屏</p>
<p>雖然今年的陰曆多了一個閏六月，但是時光過得眞決，再過一個月，又要到中秋了。</p>
<p>想起中秋，就聯念到中秋月餅，更聯念到每到中秋最活躍的冠生園冼冠生老板。</p>
<p>有一次，我和他閑談到他對付職工的態度。他以很幽默的熊度對我說：我是一個手藝出身的人，我知道他們的情形，我之對待他們，只有兩個主張，要使他們吃得飽，睏得着。」</p>
<p>我聽了他這種似滑稽而不滑稽的說話，覺得聞所未聞，吃得飽，當然是說提高職工們的待遇，睏得着又是怎樣呢？我不禁又請他解釋一下。</p>
<p>他說：「我做的是食品行業，如果他們吃不飽，餅乾，鷄蛋糕那一樣不可以充飢，如果這樣，我的損天未免太大了，所以我要使我的職工，個個都能吃得飽。一個晚間睏不着的人，如果是做店員的，日間就沒有精神應付顧客，如果是做工人的，切蛋糕也許要切到自己的手指頭上去，這都是睏不着的危險。他爲甚麽睏不着呢？或是由於經濟問題，或是由於他喜歡過荒唐的夜生活。如果是爲了經濟問題聞勿着，這是雇主對於他應盡責仟的，如果是爲了喜歡過荒唐的夜生活而睏勿着，道是他自尋苦吃，我也沒有方法去維護他了。」</p>
<p>這一番說話，雖然是簡單，但是透闢極了。</p>
<p>現在，吃不飽睏勿着的人是太多了。我希望雇主們都有冼老板的心理，同時我史希望職工們在這一個非常時期中對於自己的生活也要檢查一下，如果可以勉强吃得飽睏得着的話。</p>

<p>「依你說，叉該怎樣辦呢？」秋海棠雖在盛怒之際，却也不願一味莽撞，便站住了身子開始躊躇起來。</p>
<p>縣立初中派來的校工陳大，倒也是一個熱心人，聽他們說到這裏，便立刻丟掉了手裏的半截烟尾，走到小狗子和秋海棠兩個人的中間來。</p>
<p>「這倒不妨。」他從小狗子的臉上看到秋海棠的臉上。「那一天，他們派來的那個人，我到現在還記得很淸楚，祇要你們把我帶到有嫌疑的那份人家去瞧一瞧，我是沒有認不出來的。」</p>

<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>觀影戲「斬經堂」</p>
<p>我除硏究舊劇之外，對於電影戲，不論中西出品，也喜歡看看，而於我國舊改編的電影，允其有興味。周信芳等主演的「斬經堂一，三年前初演的時候，曾去參覜一决，覺得還好，無暇批評，最近此片又在複映，我特爲重觀一次，論其全體，相當成功，有可取之處，論列於下：</p>
<p>（一）新舊方式參互組成，如佈景，山石樹木，遠景城樓，廳堂，經堂，帳棚，旌旗，香燭，皆用實物，而主角及配角四五人，唱，白，做，裝束，仍保持舞台舊有技術及形式，此乃象眞藝術與抽象藝術之混合用法也。又有時用眞馬奔馳，而主角吳漢則始終仍用馬鞍，虛擬馬行之狀，打仗亦用舊形式，此亦眞假參互爲用。我曾思之，舊劇改編電影，新舊合用，是一定過程，除此亦無別法。但周信芳最末一個火中鏡頭，應騎眞馬，方顯偉大，今仍不用眞馬，一個人在全銀幕上，則有短小之弊，恐係信芳想露其挑火種種身段，不免一個缺點。</p>
<p>（二）片中用人用物及用時間，有極經濟可嘉者，如吳漢答應老母三件大事：第一件之放劉秀，祇由吳漢出門下命令，此時複印劉秀等騎眞馬背面奔去，第二件改換旗號，亦用前法，（打倒王莽旗號，應換漢字旗號，劉秀方面應加以考據，是何形式圖樣，今片中於此點，可惜太簡單，時間又大短，吳母和吳漢的白口又欠淸楚，普通人遂不易明瞭，此三件大事，是全劇之主腦，應當淸晰有力。）又本片中不用僮僕丫環，龍套及下手亦不多用，用人方面極爲節省，可以爲法，以上所論，是其優點。</p>
<p>劣點亦有，如曾音欠淸亮，遂不够悲壯，又吳妻·吳母·劉秀等，表情不足，白口不淸，此在舊戲猶且不可，况在電影中乎？此後希望中國電影，尤其舊劇改編之影片，於配音上，須要多多注意焉。</p>

<p>値得特別一提的是合唱，這裏除了把前幾次的合唱曲如雲雀，浮雲，逃亡，牧羊女，杜那也夫斯基首歌，歌劇「羣英喋血記」，「被開墾的處女地」及「靜靜的頓河」中的挿曲外，還增加了最近重編過的許多名曲。</p>

<p>Min River front: Chinese troops on the Min River began operations on the 25th of last month, launching a three-pronged siege and seizing the opportunity to attack the Japanese troops entrenched in Fuzhou and the areas to the left and right of the river. The encirclement gradually tightened. By the end of last month, the Japanese forces were showing signs of unrest and preparing to flee, using more than a dozen aircraft to bomb the outer lines in shifts, day and night. The officers and soldiers on the front lines of the Chinese troops bravely advanced together. The Chinese troops on the right side of the river captured Fuqing County on the dawn of the 26th. The Japanese troops counterattacked on the 27th, and repeated struggles took place in the suburbs of Fuqing City. They recaptured the county seat on the 2nd. The Japanese troops fled into the sea at Haikou, and are currently advancing towards Yingqian in Changle, sweeping through the area. The Japanese troops in the area to the right of the river can now be completely eliminated. The Chinese troops to the right of the river occupied various strongholds in Pukou and Mupu on the 26th, pressing towards Lianjiang County. Repeated struggles took place in the suburbs of the city, with fierce fighting lasting for a week. They captured the city at 2:00 AM this morning. The Japanese troops in the city suffered heavy casualties and fled towards Guantou. The Chinese troops on the front of the Min River launched simultaneous attacks on the 25th, making contact with the Japanese troops on the line of Guanyuanli and Xujiacun.

At 8:30 AM, they entered the urban area of Fuzhou. At 10:00 AM, they recovered Nantai and Cangqianshan. (Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: All sectors of the Chinese community here are very concerned about the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Fuzhou. Since the US-Japan discussions in Washington began, people here believed that Japan might temporarily refrain from any major moves in the South Pacific or Siberia in the hope that Britain and the United States would ease their economic pressure on Japan, but would focus all their efforts on overwhelming Chongqing. Now, according to Chinese sources, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Fuzhou has completely changed this situation. The Japanese move must fall into one of the following two categories: (1) Japan is now making concessions and completely succumbing to the pressure from Britain and the United States, or withdrawing from China; (2) Japan is still busy making military preparations and will launch major moves in the Far East at any moment. According to the opinions of various sectors of the Chinese community, the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Fuzhou should not be taken lightly, because the Japanese have long coveted Fujian because it is close to Taiwan, and in past national policy discussions, Japan has repeatedly demanded that Fujian be included in Japan's sphere of influence. The authorities will strengthen the status of overseas Chinese in Malaysia, the Philippines, and the Dutch East Indies because most of them are from Fujian. (Reuters dispatch on the 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">On the Three-Power Conference <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The Three-Power Conference to be held in Moscow has not been implemented for a long time after the end of the Luo-Qiu talks, and there have even been rumors of postponement. People who eagerly hope that the joint action of democratic countries will be realized cannot help but feel disappointed. According to a Washington news report yesterday: The US delegation of five people, headed by Harriman as chairman, will soon set off for Moscow. At the same time, British Cabinet Minister of Supply Beaverbrook will also lead a delegation to the Soviet Union to discuss the common aid to the Soviet Union by Britain and the United States. At a time when the Soviet army is stepping up its counter-offensive, the opening of this conference will undoubtedly provide great support to the Soviet army in both spirit and material, and promote the development of the anti-aggression war.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Soviet-German war was the starting point of a new international situation, and the cooperation between democratic countries and the Soviet Union was the key to eliminating the evils of aggression. The outbreaks of the wars in the Far East and Europe were to a certain extent using the division between democratic countries and the Soviet Union. Until recently, the Nazis still wanted to use the attack on the Soviet Union to end the hostility between Britain and Germany. Because the lessons of these past events are so painful, the world has turned to earnestly expect the elimination of past divisions and the realization of joint operations. Therefore, when the news of the Three-Power Conference spread, everyone expressed their fervent expectations, hoping that it could establish broad cooperation in principle from politics and military to economy, and that it would not only pay attention to the European war in the region, but also take into account the Far East. Moreover, in order to make this anti-aggression cooperation fully effective, China's participation is even more necessary.</p>
<p>After the Luo-Qiu talks, both Britain and the United States paid great attention to aid to the Soviet Union, such as the US oil tankers sailing to the Soviet Union and the loans between Britain and the Soviet Union, which have been realized one after another. However, regarding the issue of further cooperation, apart from the slight signs of the invasion of Iran, there has been no progress. As for the Soviet-Beijing Conference, which has attracted worldwide attention, Reuters London news on August 21 indicated that its mission was to provide the Soviet Union with the maximum assistance possible without delay, and that the discussion would also be limited to goods and supplies. Judging from the selection of the chief representatives sent by Britain and the United States; the United States is Harriman, who is responsible for implementing the Lend-Lease Act to Britain, and the British side is the Minister of Supply, Beaverbrook, both of whom are responsible for handling material assistance, then the mission of the conference pointed out by the above-mentioned Reuters news is credible and not far from the truth, and its scope is actually much narrower than what the world expected before. The issue of material support occupies the most important position in today's war, and the United States even considers itself the arsenal of democratic countries, so it cannot be underestimated, while other aspects - especially close military cooperation, are even more urgent and fundamental issues today.</p>
<p>The Nazis turned to attacking the Soviet Union when the war against Britain was stagnant. In theory, they were taking the risk of fighting on two fronts. In fact, they only left a considerable defense force in the occupied areas in the West, and the main forces of the land and air forces were used to attack the Soviet Union, and they did not really encounter the difficulties of fighting on two fronts. The heroic resistance of the Soviet Union is still strong today. Even the British and American authorities believe that it will not encounter major setbacks at least before next spring, and they are not worried about repeating the mistakes of Poland's defeat at the beginning of the European war because the Allied forces on the West front did not move, but delaying the joint counter-offensive for one day is equivalent to prolonging the disaster of aggression for one day. Under the fierce stalemate of the Soviet-German war, the Nazis may not seek other ways to take risks, which is a way to curb it that cannot be rushed. The British army's counter-offensive equipment may not have been completed, but after more than a year of preparation, it should be several times stronger than the hasty war at the beginning of the European war and the aid to Greece during the Balkan war. In the entire European continent, there may not be no way to take advantage of the opportunity. This is what Britain and the Soviet Union urgently need to negotiate and implement.</p>
<p>The Nazis have not encountered the difficulties of fighting on two fronts in Europe, but the Soviet Union is now feeling such a threat. The call for and possibility of a British army landing counter-offensive is far less than that of Japan's advance to the north. For this reason, the Soviet Union has to station hundreds of thousands of troops in the Far East to prepare for unexpected events. On the other hand, it also invisibly weakens the military strength of the West front against Germany. The way to curb the outbreak of the Pacific crisis is nothing more than the joint cooperation of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and even the Dutch East Indies, and in terms of strategic significance, the Far Eastern territory of the Soviet Union has a very important function. Now the joint front of ABCD in the South Pacific has been formed, but there is still a major gap in the North Pacific. Of course, if Japan really advances north and invades the Soviet Union in response to the Nazis, it will be intolerable for democratic countries, but so far there is no plan on how to properly control the situation, which cannot be regarded as a major regret in the anti-aggression front.</p>
<p>Looking closely at the international trends in the past half month, the period during which the news of the Three-Power Conference was silent was also the period during which US-Japan contacts were frequent. Recently, the US-Japan relationship has made no progress, and the Three-Power Conference has also announced that it will be held soon. This may be a coincidence in time, but it cannot but make people think that Britain and the United States are worried about Japan. If this is really the case, it would be a major mistake for Britain and the United States; the way to curb the crisis in the Far East is not how to dispel Japan's uneasiness, but depends on whether there is a winning strategy in politics and strategy. Now the Iranian war has ended, and the Strait of Soya to Vladivostok may not be the only important route for the United States to transport war materials to the Soviet Union, but this issue of Sino-British-American-Soviet joint cooperation in the Far East, which is more important than supplying war materials, cannot but be given close attention when the Three-Power Conference is convened.</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to Reuters' exploration of information, Chongqing and the Dutch East Indies will soon exchange diplomatic envoys. From this, it can be seen that there will be more progressive cooperation among the democratic countries in the Pacific. Detailed measures are awaiting formal approval by the Chinese and Dutch East Indies governments. It is rumored that Tada, the former Dutch ambassador to Greece, will come to Chongqing, but the official has not yet announced it. It is also rumored that China and India are now exchanging resident military officers to promote closer cooperation between the authorities of both sides.

<p>Reuter, Mexico City, 4th - A statement here says that the US government will lend Mexico 30 million US dollars. Furthermore, the President of Mexico stated that starting next year, the period and scope of military training and service will be expanded. The first step will be to implement a national conscription system, making military service obligatory for all citizens. Additionally, Mexican armories are currently experimenting with manufacturing cannons. Successful production will greatly facilitate the supply of military equipment.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Mexico City, 4th - Well-informed sources in political circles consider the rumors that the US and Mexico will announce an agreement resolving important issues between the two countries on Mexican Independence Day (September 16) to be overly optimistic.

<p>Havas News Agency, Sofia, 3rd - According to a report from Istanbul, the Turkish cabinet is about to be reshuffled. It is rumored that Prime Minister Saydam intends to submit his resignation when the parliament convenes on the 15th of this month. His position may be filled by the current Foreign Minister, Saracoğlu. Another report indicates that the Turkish President intends to form a military cabinet, but this does not mean that the country will abandon its neutrality. It is merely a precaution against unexpected border incidents.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 4th - The statement by Admiral Stirling that the British Navy may attack the Dardanelles Strait has caused increased unease among the Turkish people. This can be seen in the tone of Turkish newspapers. Turkish government officials believe that this statement is a test to gauge Turkey's reaction to an attack on the Dardanelles. Sources indicate that Turkey is adhering to its neutral policy and complying with the Montreux Convention Regarding the Straits. It is understood that Turkish legal experts are studying various aspects of this issue. It is widely believed that if the Soviet Union succumbs to German pressure and loses its Black Sea ports, the question of whether Britain should assist or allow the Soviet fleet to pass through the Dardanelles will become even more serious.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Pacific War or Peace Issue Nears Decisive Moment: US Determined Not to Abandon Freedom of the Seas, Oil Tankers Headed to USSR Sail Near Japanese Territorial Waters, White House Denies Konoe's Suggestion to Meet Roosevelt <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 4th - Japan's policy toward US arms shipments to the Soviet Union is nearing a critical moment, as American oil tankers loaded with aircraft gasoline are sailing near Japanese territorial waters under the American flag. Observers believe that the fate of these oil tankers will determine the question of war or peace in the Pacific. Japan has protested the sailing of oil tankers to Vladivostok, but the United States seems determined not to abandon its policy of freedom of the seas. Four American oil tankers left the Pacific coast in mid-August for Vladivostok and are expected to reach the Tsugaru Strait by the end of this week. Although Japan has repeatedly protested, officials doubt that the Japanese government will rashly intercept them. It is also learned that both governments are handling the matter carefully, hoping to avoid any provocative actions.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 4th - NBC received a wireless report from Australia today stating that the first American oil tanker has arrived in Vladivostok. However, the US Maritime Commission in Washington said that the arrival of the oil tanker seems premature. Officials of the Maritime Commission stated that the first of four American oil tankers bound for the Soviet Union will soon pass through the Tsugaru Strait controlled by Japan and arrive in Vladivostok before the end of this week.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 3rd - Right-wing political organizations have recently demanded that the government take strong action in its relations with the United States and prevent American military supplies from being shipped to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok. The National News stated that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will begin a vigorous campaign to establish a strong foreign policy.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 4th - "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated today that Japanese diplomacy is attempting to urge the United States to maintain peace in the Pacific "at the last possible moment." However, Japan's policy of opposing interference by third countries remains unchanged. "Teito Shimbun" warned that Japan should pay attention to every move of the United States, and that US-Japan relations cannot be harmonized unless the United States changes its actions.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 4th - "Yomiuri Shimbun" published information from Washington yesterday, stating that Major General Danell told Mr. Kishi, a member of the Japanese Diet, that the US government and the Navy do not want to go to war with Japan. However, Danell also told Kishi that anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States has become increasingly intense since Japan occupied French Indochina. The newspaper also stated that Kishi is currently visiting Washington and was specially received by Major General Danell. When asked if the United States believes that the freezing order and aid to the Soviet Union via Vladivostok were not anti-Japanese actions, Major General Danell stated that US-Japan relations must be based on the principle of reciprocity, and Japan cannot unilaterally believe that the United States is unfriendly.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - US Presidential Secretary O'Reilly spoke yesterday, adding to the White House's announcement that President Roosevelt had received a proposal to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Konoe at sea. He stated that the route planned for the President's cruise was from Annapolis, New Scotland, to Chesapeake Bay in the east, and then up the Potomac River back to Washington. Many skeptical journalists have hired boats to follow the President's yacht. Washington, 3rd - The content of Roosevelt's reply to Konoe's letter and when it will be sent are currently being kept secret. However, some activity is clearly underway between US and Japanese officials in Washington. Hull still insists that this is a "trial" of sorts. Because the United States is deeply concerned about Japan's future actions, its attitude towards Japan has gradually become firmer. Well-informed sources claim that the US policy on the Pacific issue has been clearly stated by officials, and there is no room for Japan to misunderstand. US officials are optimistic that Japan's bargaining power is gradually decreasing, while the power of the US, Britain, China, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union is gradually increasing. According to general diplomatic commentators, the United States is unwilling to alleviate Japan's difficulties unless it obtains concrete proof that Japan's policy has completely changed course.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - The US Navy Department released a report on the progress of the two-ocean navy, stating that 212 ships of all classes have been completed since January 1, 1941, and 436 have had their keels laid. In addition, 249 ships of various types were launched between January 1 and September 1, and only require finishing work. Ships completed since January 1 include two battleships, three submarines, twelve destroyers, and forty-two patrol ships.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 4th - Rear Admiral Land, Chairman of the US Maritime Commission, told reporters yesterday that the US shipbuilding program is proceeding faster than expected. He expects that between July of this year and the end of 1943, new ships with a total deadweight tonnage of 12,211,000 tons will be in service. This figure does not include the 105 ships already delivered under the Commission's program, or the smaller ships being built by the Commission. Land also issued a statement saying that in view of the extreme importance of shipbuilding in the national defense program, he is issuing a report on shipbuilding progress, and that Congress and newspapers should fully understand the Commission's shipbuilding process and the speed of ship production. According to recent reports from the shipyards, if delays caused by priority construction rights and other reasons do not slow down production, 130 to 134 new ships can be completed this year, 90 new ships can be delivered in the first quarter of next year, totaling one million tons, 146 in the second quarter, totaling 1.4 million tons, 154 in the third quarter, totaling 1.646 million tons, and 184 in the fourth quarter, totaling two million tons. In the first quarter of 1943, 220 ships can be put into service, totaling 2.27 million tons. Therefore, the ships delivered by US shipyards in the first quarter of 1942 will be more than those produced in any year since the last World War, except for 1941, and more than those produced in the entire year of 1917 when the United States entered the war. If the United States can proceed according to its established program in the first quarter of 1943, the new ships it delivers will exceed the 1.83 million tons produced in the entire year of 1918. If the current situation and the situation within this year do not change, the UK and the US will have three new ships per week. It is expected that the US national defense and lend-lease programs in 1941 will be very tense. With this in mind, we have worked hard to reach and maintain a high level of production in the first quarter of 1941 until the end of 1943.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Moscow Issues Communiqué: Soviet Troops Fighting Fiercely Along Entire Front, Concentrating Strong Forces in Three Regions, German Autumn Strategy Likely to Fail <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 4th - Last night's Soviet communiqué stated that yesterday Soviet troops fought bravely against the enemy along the entire front line. In air battles on September 1, 39 enemy aircraft were shot down, and our forces lost 27 aircraft.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - Military commentators say that in the Soviet-German war, both sides are now exhausting their intelligence and strength to seek a decisive battle that favors their side. But as the fighting intensifies, less reliable news is emerging. The communiqués issued by the Soviet and German command headquarters are extremely brief, containing only a few words. Officials in London said yesterday that there is currently a lack of official news and no information to confirm any major progress in the German offensive against Leningrad or the repeated Soviet counter-offensives in the central and southern regions. However, as winter approaches, the main points of the German autumn strategy are likely to be to occupy Leningrad, Kiev, Odessa, and even Moscow, in order to stabilize their lines, engage in winter warfare, and greatly weaken the Soviet navy, industrial, and political strength, so that they can mobilize troops to the eastern Mediterranean, North Africa, and even invade Britain, in order to contain and reduce the strength of the British Air Force. The German timetable for a large-scale invasion of Britain this year has undoubtedly been overturned. Returning a sufficient number of aircraft to Northwest Europe, launching another air raid on Britain, and sending several divisions of German airborne troops to land in Britain before winter, in an attempt to destroy key British Air Force aircraft and damage other extremely important targets. If these troops invade Britain, it would be tantamount to suicide, but the German command headquarters may believe that they can carry out significant destruction before being annihilated or captured, and would not hesitate to do so. However, the German army has nowhere to turn. Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union must unite their forces and strike a painful blow.</p>
<p>Reuters, Zurich, 4th - According to a Berlin correspondent for the Geneva Daily, the Germans have assembled very powerful forces in Smolensk, Moscow, and Kiev, making fluid warfare impossible. Even if Leningrad is besieged, it can hold out for a long time. Military circles in Berlin express the view that this fact has forced the German high command to cope with a new strategic situation, and they have no choice but to reorganize their troops and send reinforcements. It is expected that it will take some time to change this situation. Therefore, the German army and the Soviet army commanded by Generals Timoshenko and Budyonny are currently deploying a great new battle in the Gomel area. The German army hopes to implement three major encirclement movements. If the Soviet army does not move for a long time, they plan to encircle the three major cities of Leningrad, Smolensk, and Kiev.</p>
<p>United Press, 4th - Authoritative Nazi sources claim that the German forces, only twelve miles from Leningrad, have been temporarily stalled due to fierce resistance from Soviet forces outside the city and heavy rain. In the previous 24 hours, the German forces, which had reached the outskirts of the former Tsarist capital, made little progress because the troops led by Voroshilov were fighting desperately. A German spokesman said that the range of German artillery fire has not yet reached Leningrad. The spokesman said that the fiercest fighting is expected to occur soon, as the German forces around the city have formed an impenetrable encirclement. Currently, only the area east of Leningrad, near the Neva River on the south shore of Lake Ladoga, is the only way out for the Soviet army. The German army admits that Soviet forces are counterattacking along the entire line, and in some places, hundreds of tanks weighing 40 tons have joined the battle. It is also said that German aircraft cannot bomb Leningrad due to bad weather. A Nazi propaganda report also said that the German army is now facing unexpected difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Leningrad's Defenses are Strong, the Main Force of the Soviet Baltic Fleet is Undamaged, the Soviet Side is Actively Preparing for Winter Warfare <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 4th - Leningrad's defenses, organized by General Voroshilov, are extremely strong and should prevent the German forces attacking the city from succeeding for many months to come. The German claim that their troops have advanced to within 15 miles south of the city is unfounded. Although the Finnish side also claims to have occupied Viipuri, the Finnish-German allied forces are advancing very slowly from the north. It is widely believed that the situation in Leningrad is quite satisfactory. In terms of military equipment, Leningrad can be self-sufficient and has sufficient necessary equipment to supply the large army inside and outside the city, while the German army is bound to suffer due to difficult transportation and supply. The arrival of September is now making the German transportation increasingly difficult, and soon the roads will be muddy, leaving only a few major highways passable. Sources say that the German claims about the losses of the Soviet navy are utterly absurd. There is very strong reason to believe that the main force of the Soviet Baltic Fleet remains intact. This is an important auxiliary for defending Leningrad, as it can harass the German forces advancing along both sides of the Gulf of Finland. The issue of supplying food to Leningrad is quite important. Newspapers have published plans to conserve the use of certain metals in the manufacturing process. The railway from Moscow to Leningrad has not been captured by the German army in the slightest, and the important railway from Leningrad to Vologda can also be used to transport necessary supplies. This road runs along the south shore of Lake Ladoga and is far from any area occupied by the German army. Furthermore, Leningrad's food needs are now different from peacetime, as a large number of residents, including children, have been evacuated. Regarding the slow progress of the Finnish army advancing on Leningrad from the north, it is heard that the Finnish army first consolidates its positions whenever it occupies a small piece of land, and then continues to advance. The German army is not like that, always advancing rashly and hastily. This can be seen from the repeated Soviet counter-offensives. In addition, the recent reports on the situation in the central Gomel region and the lower reaches of the Dnieper River do not mention new place names. Judging from the current situation, the German army has not been able to break through at any point to see Belynsk (the most important industrial center east of Gomel), or attack Gomel from the south, to flank or directly attack the Kharkov industrial area. The German army has not yet occupied Moscow or other extremely important centers, nor has it been able to destroy the Red Army. Now it is trying to eliminate the Soviet potential for combat, but although the industrial cities west of the Dnieper River have been lost, the Soviet wartime production has not been significantly affected. However, there is indeed reason for the UK and the US to step up the transportation of various equipment to the Soviet Union. Undoubtedly, the Soviet side is actively preparing for winter warfare, and the difficulties encountered by the German army will be far greater than those of the Soviet army, which is accustomed to enduring the cold. Soviet soldiers who are currently on leave all say that morale is high and military rations are abundant.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - The battle to attack and defend Leningrad is still raging fiercely. The German side says it is less than twelve miles from the city, while the Soviet side claims to have stopped the German forces 50 miles away. All news indicates that casualties on both sides are extremely heavy. Soviet aircraft continue to patrol the city's skies. Today's Moscow telegram says that the German attempt to attack Leningrad from the south has been repelled.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Fierce Fighting in the Northern Region, German Forces in the Central Region Retreat 30 Miles, Soviet Troops Demonstrate Heroic Fighting Spirit <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th - After General Voroshilov personally visited the front line of the war zone and supervised the defense of Leningrad, the fighting in the area has intensified. Moscow Radio broadcast to the Soviet people last night that the battlefield of Leningrad is a few miles outside the city's outer defense line. The German forces closest to the Soviet fortresses are currently resisting the Soviet attacks, but the bad weather has prevented the air force from providing large-scale assistance to the ground forces. Moscow's Pravda reported that a large air battle took place in the Baltic Sea. More than a hundred German bombers attempted to attack a certain key point and were repelled by Soviet fighters, coastal artillery, and Soviet ships. News from Moscow says that Soviet forces in a certain sector of the front line have successfully counterattacked. The Red Star also reported that Soviet forces fought bravely for many days, recaptured twelve villages, and drove the German forces back 30 miles. This battle occurred approximately in the central region. A German war correspondent broadcasting on Berlin Radio said that the German forces in the central region are currently engaged in the most intense fighting ever seen in the Smolensk region. The sound of artillery fire is continuous, without a moment's pause. The Swiss Geneva newspaper quoted a Berlin report describing the details of the fighting in the central region, saying that the Soviet side has transferred a large army to the three regions of Smolensk, Moscow, and Kiev, forcing the German forces to redeploy and send reinforcements. A German newspaper war commentator recently described the hardships suffered by the German forces, saying that a German battalion in a certain sector of the Eastern Front, surrounded by Bolshevik forces, has been lying in the mud for several days in heavy rain, with their military uniforms drenched and covered in mud, and without hot food.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 4th - The Red Star reported from Leningrad, describing General Voroshilov's observation of the front line outside the city ten days ago, saying that Voroshilov arrived at the forward positions on a certain night before issuing an order instructing the Leningrad garrison to resolutely defend this glorious city. That night, he drew up a battle plan, and at dawn, the artillery began to bombard. When the attack time arrived, a battalion of Soviet troops led by Denisov moved out, crossed the river, and launched a fierce attack on the forest. The enemy's counterattack was useless. The Soviet troops stormed into the forest and began the battle for the village of N. The fascist troops abandoned their weapons and equipment and fled in panic. The Soviet side then sent a team of reinforcements led by Lieutenant Solilov to assist in the battle. They arrived at the riverbank, established trenches, and the army occupied the village, driving the German forces back three miles. The Soviet troops are using this kind of spirit to bravely defend Leningrad day and night.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 4th - London estimates that the Axis powers lost 4,000 aircraft in the war against the Soviet Union in just over two months (mainly the German Air Force). Last year, 3,018 were lost in the skies over and around Britain, most of which were destroyed in the four-month Battle of Britain. Excluding those lost in the Soviet Union, the Axis aircraft (mostly German) lost 8,020 aircraft in the first two years of the war (excluding the Polish war). The British Air Force lost 3,089 aircraft. The small losses of the British Naval Air Arm are not included. The Soviet aircraft losses are unknown, but judging from the figures admitted by the Soviet side, their losses are also not light.</p>

According to the Air Ministry Information Office, a large number of four-engine Stirling heavy bombers flew to Berlin. The visibility was clear. The largest bombs landed near the main railway station, and other industrial buildings were also heavily bombed, with fires breaking out everywhere.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Zeng Yangfu, Deputy Director of the Chinese Visiting Group to Burma, gave a speech at the Rotary Club dinner here in Yangon. He stated that the Yunnan-Burma Railway is a vital iron link between China and Burma. Mr. Zeng elaborated on the benefits that the railway will bring to a vast area upon its completion. Not only will it connect Burma with Southwest China, but also Malaysia, India, Central China, and North China. He added that the Chinese territory the railway passes through is largely undeveloped and rich in mineral resources. If Burma is willing, it can obtain coal supplies from this area. The railway has undeniable economic value for both China and Burma. When asked if the railway would be important after the end of the Sino-Japanese War, Mr. Zeng replied in the affirmative, stating that China will rebuild after the war, but not on the ashes of factories it destroyed itself. Instead, it will build on a new foundation, located inland where raw materials and transportation are easily accessible. The new economic order that has emerged in the Chinese interior in recent years will continue to develop the policy of industrializing the hinterland after the war. Mr. Zeng estimated that the journey from Yunnan and Sichuan to Yangon via the railway would be only one-third of the distance of taking the Yangtze River waterway to Shanghai and then changing to sea transport. It is reported that the cost of constructing the Burmese section of the new railway will soon be borne by the British government. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Shanghai Municipal Council Plans to Levy Special Tax on Commercial Buildings from Next Year <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Based on property valuation, divided into categories A and B, estimated annual revenue of seven million yuan.</p>
<p>Businesses making substantial profits should pay more taxes.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council held its first meeting after the summer recess at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday (3rd) in the conference room. In addition to discussing several routine cases, the meeting also discussed the "Researching New Tax Sources" Committee's proposal to levy a "special property tax" on commercial buildings starting January 1st of next year. After a brief deliberation, the original proposal was passed. The entire process took only half an hour. Afterwards, the attendees exchanged pleasantries with the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, and the meeting adjourned at 5:20 PM. The much-anticipated case of levying a special tax on commercial buildings was thus completely decided. The Public Information Office of the Municipal Council issued a public announcement yesterday afternoon, as follows:</p>
<p>Tax levied based on property valuation.</p>
<p>According to the Public Information Office of the Municipal Council, the Council, based on the recommendation of the "Researching New Tax Sources" Committee, submitted the item of levying a "special property tax" on commercial buildings for preliminary review at the regular meeting on July 23rd. It was resolved to refer the case to the Finance Committee for further discussion. The Finance Committee then met on August 18th and conducted a comprehensive study. As a result, it decided to recommend to the Council that, after consulting with the "Consultation Committee" currently being established, the Council should immediately levy a special property tax on buildings used for various industrial and commercial purposes, as well as for professional occupations, based on the property valuation. Such buildings are proposed to be divided into two categories, A and B.</p>
<p>Taxed buildings divided into two categories.</p>
<p>Category A buildings (excluding those used purely for residential purposes and those listed in Category B) include offices, shops, pawnshops, factories, warehouses, wharves, etc. The special tax levied annually will be 8% of the property valuation. Category B buildings are securities, gold, and commodity exchanges. The special tax levied annually will be 15% of the property valuation. The proposal was submitted for discussion on the 2nd of this month and was resolved to approve the above classification method for levying the "Special Property Tax on Commercial Buildings." Further consideration may be given after consulting the opinions of the "Consultation Committee." The special tax is planned to be levied starting January 1st, 1942, with an estimated annual revenue of approximately 7 million yuan.</p>
<p>Category A burden has been reduced.</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Da Zhong News Agency, the "Researching New Tax Sources" Committee originally intended to levy 14% on Category A buildings with a property valuation of 3,000 yuan or less, and 10% on those exceeding 3,000 yuan. For Category B, the rates were 10% for those under 3,000 yuan and 8% for those above 3,000 yuan. Subsequently, the Finance Committee, upon reconsideration, believed that the tax rate should be slightly higher for those with larger capital, while it should be reduced for smaller operators. Therefore, it was revised to a uniform 8% for Category A and a uniform 15% for Category B. The selection of personnel for the Consultation Committee is in progress, with approximately 16 or 17 members. It is expected to be established by mid-month. The Municipal Council will then submit this tax increase proposal for deliberation, soliciting opinions from all parties to complete the preparations within the year and begin levying the tax next year.</p>
<p>Tax rate differences within the two concessions.</p>
<p>The Chinese-language newspaper *Zi Lin Bao* states that, according to informed non-official sources yesterday, the Municipal Council's proposal is a modified version of the French Concession's tax collection methods, classifying businesses and professions. The French Concession's tax is levied on businesses, professions, and industries, based on the valuation of the occupied building, divided into two categories as follows: (A) all businesses, shops, industries, factories, warehouses, and trade, except those specified in Category B; (B) banks, brokers, finance companies, real estate companies, rental agencies, business management offices, law firms, and insurance management offices, etc. For Category A, the tax rate is 8% for properties with a valuation of 2,400 yuan or less, and 6% for valuations exceeding this amount, with a minimum of 5 yuan per year. For Category B, the tax rate is 12% for properties with a valuation of 2,400 yuan or less, and 10% for valuations exceeding this amount, with a minimum of 10 yuan per year.</p>
<p>Tax ratios under discussion.</p>
<p>As for the business tax levied by the Public Concession, although it is still under study, the public and non-official sources have been discussing various types of businesses and professions subject to this tax, and have written to newspapers expressing various opinions. It is believed that certain types of businesses can pay more taxes than others, especially those businesses that have made substantial profits since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. Regarding the issue of tax collection, the Municipal Council has also formed a committee, consisting of major merchants and lawyers, whose findings after a detailed investigation of the situation have been of great assistance to the Council.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Measures for Managing the Shanghai Exchange Market to be Finalized Next Week – British Commissioner Hall Patch Also Arrived in Hong Kong – Gold Market Resumes Futures Trading Yesterday <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>According to reliable sources in the banking sector yesterday, the American Commissioner of the Stabilization Fund, Mr. Fox, has not yet returned to Hong Kong. However, after Mr. Taylor, the American advisor, and the general managers of Citibank and Mercantile Bank, Mr. Mackay and Mr. Hawkins, arrived in Hong Kong, they held several informal meetings with the Chinese Commissioners, Mr. Chen Guangfu, Mr. Song Ziwen, and Mr. Xi Demao, regarding the management of the Shanghai exchange market. The British Commissioner, Mr. Hall Patch, who sailed south on the American mail ship President Garfield one morning, also arrived in Hong Kong on the 3rd to participate in the discussions. The purpose of the meeting is to find a thorough and effective solution that aligns with the established policies of the Stabilization Fund and the suggestions of foreign banks. It is expected that progress will be made within the week, with a final decision to be made next week.</p>
<p>Payment for kerosene can still purchase foreign exchange.</p>
<p>After five banks, HSBC, Mercantile, Chartered, Citibank, and Chase, suspended black market quotations on the 29th, black market activity was greatly restricted. As the outcome of the Hong Kong meeting was uncertain, the risks were high, and speculators had no way to practice their skills. Most of the current transactions involve banks absorbing a small number of export bills and supplying them for the payment of gasoline and kerosene. As of yesterday, only HSBC had consistently suspended black market trading. Chartered Bank did not engage in this type of transaction on the day before yesterday and yesterday. Although Mercantile Bank received a telegram from its general manager, Mr. Hawkins, from Hong Kong, instructing it to stop black market trading, it only complied for one day and resumed its original operations yesterday morning, but on a very small scale, limited to selling the positions it had absorbed on the same day. The situation at Citibank and Chase was roughly the same.</p>
<p>The future of the black market will be difficult to thrive.</p>
<p>As for the future of the black market, whether it will eventually disappear, foreign banks observe that the scope of the black market can be restricted to a very small range, but it will not disappear completely. It is said that the new foreign exchange provided to the north after approval by the Stabilization Fund, such as rice imported from the Dutch East Indies which is not from the sterling area, has also been approved in one or two batches. American cotton was initially approved, but has recently been disallowed. Lauan wood shipped from Manila to Shanghai has also been approved. The Stabilization Fund does not seem to have a fixed standard for this type of application, but changes it at any time according to the development of the situation. It is not that all goods from the UK and the US are approved, nor that imports from countries other than the UK and the US are absolutely prohibited. Under these circumstances, some imported goods have no choice but to rely on the black market.</p>
<p>Gold market settlement standard determined.</p>
<p>Since the suspension of black market quotations, gold futures trading has lost its settlement standard and has been suspended for many days. Although meetings have been convened repeatedly, disputes have arisen between the bulls and the bears, with one side advocating settlement based on the black market exchange rate, and the other advocating settlement based on the HSBC quotation rate set by the Stabilization Fund. No resolution has been reached. It was not until the afternoon of the day before yesterday that the brokers' meeting reached a decision to compromise and average the HSBC quotation rate and the black market exchange rate on the same day as the new standard for monthly settlement. Swaps will still be held on the 14th of each month. Because the settlement issue has been resolved, the gold market resumed futures trading yesterday. It is reported that the decisions made at the brokers' meeting are as follows:</p>
<p>In the future, gold trading can use eight types of substitutes for margin, including US dollars, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, US dollar bills, and cash. The fair price will be determined by a committee of eight members selected from forty brokers. Gold settlement will be calculated by averaging the HSBC quotation rate and the black market exchange rate.</p>

<p>Fuzhou City has been recovered by the Chinese army on the 3rd after multiple sieges. After the good news spread to Shanghai, people from all walks of life in the city sent a joint telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express their congratulations. Since Fuzhou was recovered by the Chinese army, the restoration of telegram services between Shanghai and Fuzhou is being planned and will be restored soon. As for shipping between Shanghai and Fuzhou, it is difficult to restore in the short term because the fierce fighting has not ended and the Min River has been blockaded. Currently, British merchant ships are sailing to and from Fuqing port. Postal services between Shanghai and Fujian are still transported via Xiamen.</p>

<p>According to the *China Press*, since the end of March of this year, five Soviet cargo ships have successively arrived in Shanghai and entered dry docks for major repairs. It is reported that one of them, named Hpatvci Saya Industriya (Food Industry), has completed all necessary repairs and will leave port next week, presumably heading to Manila to load supplies for Vladivostok. The repair work on the other four ships is still in progress and may be completed by the end of this month, after which they will sail to Manila and Thailand.</p>
<p>Loading Supplies for the Soviet Union. It is said that in the next few days, another Soviet ship will arrive from Vladivostok for repairs. It is reported that the US government previously prohibited the shipment of goods to the Soviet Union, resulting in a large number of supplies being confiscated in the Philippines. Now that the US government has lifted the embargo, it is believed that the Soviet ships being repaired in Shanghai will also be used to load these supplies.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Inspector General of Customs Promulgates Ministry Order on Limit of Cash Carried at Coastal Locations – Limit of 200 Yuan for Those Traveling from Coastal Areas to Shanghai – 500 Yuan Allowed for Others <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Maze, received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing regarding currency: "It has been found that the limit of cash carried per person leaving the country from coastal locations (including ports and non-ports) is 200 yuan, which you have already been instructed to forward to the relevant customs offices for compliance. Now, a telegram from Sitai on the 4th states, "It has been found that the Chongqing Qian telegram previously issued by the Ministry stipulates that the limit for each person carrying legal tender for export from Zhejiang, Fujian, and nearby places with customs branches is 200 yuan. This special case originally referred only to those traveling to Shanghai. Those leaving for other places within the country or abroad, except Hong Kong, should still follow the original method of 500 yuan. This time, the above regulations have been used as a reference in your directive, stating that the limit for each person carrying cash for export from coastal locations such as Zhejiang and Fujian, including ports and non-ports, is 200 yuan. Does this still refer only to those traveling to Shanghai, or does it mean that all those leaving from coastal locations, regardless of their destination, are limited to 200 yuan? Please clarify for us to follow. We have received the message and have verified that the Chongqing Qian telegram (513) (03.18) issued by this Ministry is a supplementary regulation based on the Chongqing Qian telegram of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939]. The regulations stipulate that individuals departing from coastal areas, including ports and non-ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, are allowed to carry only 200 yuan to Shanghai. As for those travelling from coastal areas to other non-port locations, unless otherwise specified, the previous 500 yuan limit should still apply. Therefore, please investigate and order the subordinate customs offices to inspect and enforce it together."</p>

<h3 id="e48">Subsidies from the Industry and Commerce Group – Application Deadline Today – Determination to Pursue Further Studies Required – Those Studying Wireless Technology Should Pay More Attention <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The deadline for applications for scholarships from the Industry and Commerce Group of this newspaper's reader scholarship fund is 6:00 PM today. Late applications will not be accepted under any circumstances. The number of application forms received in recent days has exceeded expectations. For the past two days alone, more than 400 copies have been received. Now that schools have started one after another, the colleagues will carry their seals to the business department of this newspaper to collect the subsidies or free letters of introduction as soon as the approved list is announced. However, the scope of the subsidies is limited to employees in industry and commerce, which may result in failure to approve all requests, which is deeply regrettable. It is hoped that all sectors will understand.</p>
<p>All Practicum Costs Must Be Self-Funded</p>
<p>In recent days, many letters have been received from employees applying for subsidies, raising questions about studying subjects such as radio. The reader scholarship fund committee of this newspaper has long agreed to subsidize tuition fees as a principle for students and employees applying for subsidies. The practicum and miscellaneous expenses required for the course should be borne by the students themselves. There are also employees whose requested subjects are not related to their jobs at all, which is inconsistent with the original intention of this association to assist employees in pursuing the necessary knowledge for their businesses. In order to cherish the loyal service of employees in various industries and to promote the spirit of dedication, it is necessary to be more cautious in order to truly benefit the employees' love of learning and pragmatism. We hope that all those applying for subsidies will prepare for the practicum expenses themselves, so as not to disappoint the kindness of the readers' subsidies. If they are really unable to pay the practicum fees, please notify this association and be determined not to give up halfway, so as not to betray the kindness of all sectors to donate to education.</p>
<p>Each school should pay attention to the donated scholarships</p>
<p>We are very grateful to the various vocational training schools for donating free scholarships in response to this newspaper's industry and commerce employee movement. However, yesterday, a student approved for free admission reported to the museum or wrote to state that the school only allowed them to study one subject. This may be due to a misunderstanding and must be explained. For example, if a school donates several free Chinese and English interpretation scholarships, and the school stipulates that free students are only allowed to study one subject, but this newspaper calculates one person as two when applying for Chinese and English studies. For example, if a school donates a total of 20 free Chinese and English scholarships, if 10 people apply to this newspaper for free admission to study English and Chinese, it will be counted as 20 people. In short, each person who studies two subjects is not counted as one free student, but as two free students. If the quota is full, this newspaper will provide additional funding. We respectfully ask all schools to pay attention.</p>
<p>A total of 21 schools donated scholarships.</p>
<p>As of September 2nd, a total of 21 schools have responded to this newspaper's industry and commerce employee movement and donated free scholarships (in order of receipt): Shanghai Second Vocational School, Mengxian English College, China Advanced Vocational School, Nanyang Vocational Training School, Ada Wireless School, Lixin Accounting School, Miller's English College, Mushi English College, Fifth, Fourth, Third, Second, China Vocational Training School, Wuxi National Studies School, Yiyou Amateur Training School, Global Typing School, Jingmo Vocational Night School, Nanxun National Studies School, Shanghai Engineering College, Zhenguang Mathematics and Science College, Cambridge English College, Hudong Commune. In addition, there are six or seven schools, such as Diansheng Wireless Electrical Industry School, etc., that have not been processed due to late letters, and we apologize for this. Currently, China Advanced Vocational School (with half fee scholarships), Ada Wireless, Lixin Accounting, Mushi English, Fourth China, and Second China are all full.</p>
<p>Poor Children's Education</p>
<p>Miss Huang Wenjie is nine years old and a student in the fourth grade of Fuli Luli Zhenying Model Primary School. She was born in the Affiliated Hospital of the Hangzhou Provincial Obstetrics School in the 22nd year of the Republic [i.e. 1933]. Because her parents had many children and were in financial difficulty, she was abandoned in the hospital. Later, the hospital adopted artificial feeding methods to raise her. She is naturally intelligent. After the August 13th Incident, Hangzhou was occupied and the hospital was disbanded. Ms. Huang Shufang, a childcare instructor, led a group to Shanghai (Ms. Huang is now employed at Renhe Hospital) and sent her to Zhenying Primary School. All expenses are borne by Ms. Huang. In recent years, due to the rapid increase in prices, the tuition and boarding fees per semester have increased to more than 300 yuan. Ms. Huang's hard-earned income is not enough to cover the costs, and she has requested assistance from this newspaper. After reviewing the case, the colleagues found that the student has not yet graduated from primary school, which is not in accordance with the application qualifications. However, the circumstances are indeed very pitiful. Therefore, the application was submitted to the scholarship committee for processing. Committee member Shen Siliang agreed to find a way to provide relief. Fortunately, a gentleman enthusiastically came to the rescue and donated 2,000 yuan to be deposited in the bank as the student's education expenses. From now on, the poor child will not drop out of school. His future success is due to the gentleman's kindness. This newspaper admires his enthusiasm for education and hereby praises him.</p>

<h3 id="e50">大順康 Wheel, Sets Sail Southward <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>For the convenience of travelers going to the free China in the Southwest, the French shipping company, Likhong Shipping Company, specially dispatched the Dashun Kang wheel directly to Guangzhou Bay, Chikkan, and entrusted the China Travel Service to handle all passenger boarding procedures. Since this news was released, travelers wishing to go to the Southwest have flocked to the company to purchase tickets, causing extraordinary crowding. The number of goods being loaded and transported into the interior is especially large, so that the wheel, which was originally scheduled to leave the port on the 1st of this month, was unable to set sail on schedule due to insufficient cargo loading, and was delayed until 4 pm yesterday, when it finally set sail south from the Yangshupu No. 20 floating dock. It is reported that the wheel has more than 100 passengers and goods worth more than 2 million Hong Kong dollars. If this trip goes smoothly, it will continue to run between Shanghai and Guangzhou Bay. According to a reliable source in the shipping industry reported yesterday by a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, the China Aviation Company's Hong Kong to Nanxiong line operates approximately once a week, which is very inconvenient for passengers. According to a telegram from Hong Kong yesterday, the Hong Kong to Nanxiong route will operate daily from now on, with a fare of 270 Hong Kong dollars. There is a bus available from Nanxiong to Shaozhou, and Shaozhou is located on the Yuehan Railway, so it is convenient and quick to transfer to Guiyang, Kunming and other free China areas from there. The fare from Nanxiong to Shaozhou is 20 legal tender.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese authorities stipulated that inspection of vaccination certificates should begin on August 1st at all bridges on the Suzhou River, it was originally scheduled for one month, until August 31st. However, the Japanese authorities have now announced an extension. All residents entering Hongkou are subject to inspection restrictions. The Japanese Marine Corps has also stationed armed soldiers at key traffic points such as the Waibaidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge to assist in the inspection.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Yue Lai Southern Goods Store Owner, Gong Fanglai, Shot At - Bullet Strikes Abdomen, Life in Critical Danger as Car Passes Shandong Road and Fuzhou Road <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 9 o'clock, a shooting incident occurred at Fuzhou Road and Shandong Road. The victim was Gong Fanglai, the owner of Yue Lai Southern Goods Store, who was shot in the abdomen. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Major Southern Goods Merchant</p>
<p>Gong Fanglai, a native of Pudong, is 67 years old and lives at No. 37, Lane 68, Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession. He owns Yue Lai Southern Goods Store at No. 354 Guangdong Road in the International Settlement, Quanfu Company at No. 568 Fuzhou Road, Chunyang Southern Goods Store at No. 29 Henan Road, and Hengxin Company at No. 95 Guangxi Road. He usually has a chartered car and employs Yang Shengkang (35 years old) from Nantong as the driver.</p>
<p>Suddenly Shot At</p>
<p>At 9:15 yesterday morning, Gong took the chartered car from Yue Lai Store, carrying 16,000 yuan in cash and 35,000 yuan in checks, intending to go to Jianchang Qianzhuang in Wei Hou Lane, Tianjin Road, to settle the accounts. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the entrance of Shili Xiang Noodle Restaurant at No. 164 Shandong Road and Fuzhou Road, two men suddenly jumped out. One person grabbed the lever of the chartered car, while the other took out a pistol and fired two shots at Gong. One bullet hit Gong's abdomen, and blood immediately flowed. However, Gong was still conscious and told the driver to quickly drive to Quanfu Company.</p>
<p>Bullet in Abdomen</p>
<p>The shooter(s), seeing that Gong had been shot, fled without a trace. Therefore, Gong arrived safely at Quanfu Company, reported to the police that it was a robbery, and urgently called an ambulance to Renji Hospital for treatment, where he was admitted to Ward 264 of the second class. However, the bullet entered his abdomen and has not yet been removed, and his life is in critical danger. The police are investigating the cause of the incident.</p>

<p>At around 9 pm yesterday, a hand grenade was suddenly found inside Zhen Yuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 11, Lane 172, Alabaster Road, in the Public Concession. The factory reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate and took the hand grenade to the police station for destruction. It is reported that recently, some workers in the factory have demanded a salary increase from the management due to the high cost of goods and the difficulty of living. However, they were not granted permission and planned to strike. However, another group of workers refused to participate, and the opinions of both sides were very inconsistent.</p>

<p>Zhu Minggao, the owner of Zhu Youji Shipping Company at No. 10, Ji An Lane, Edward Road, had a dispute with Sun Baoji Shipping Company, a fellow trader, over the rental of ships. He harbored a grudge and transferred his hatred to Qian Linsheng, Yu Guanjin, Jia Chunfa, and Lu Fugen, partners of Sun Baoji Company. On the 3rd of last month, he falsely accused Qian and the other three of holding weapons and robbing him of 150 legal tender at Xiaohuayuan on Zhejiang Road on July 30th. The police, upon receiving the report, detained Qian and the other three for a week, but after investigation, found that they were innocent and released them. After being released, Qian and others sued Zhu to the Central Police Station for falsely accusing them of robbery, intending to have them punished, and that his heart was too vicious. Hua detectives Peng Bingsheng and Huang Hairu investigated and confirmed the facts, and arrested Zhu and sent him to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng opened the court for further interrogation. The lawyers for the police, Ru BaoYi and Qian Xunjiu, said that the defendant's actions were malicious, because robbery is severely punished by law. If the police had not investigated, Qian Linsheng and others would have suffered injustice. Now they have suffered great damage. If he is not severely punished, it will be difficult to convince the public. After Judge Feng questioned Zhu Minggao, he announced that Zhu Minggao was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for false accusation as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Three Labor Disputes Resolved <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Dock Workers' Strike: After a certain celebrity and the person in charge of the strike at the Hongkou Gonghexiang dock negotiated, the opinions of both parties were quite consistent. The employer implemented the dismissal of Tian Guishan, the patrolman who caused the trouble, and Song Er, the foreman. The other issues, such as compensation and wage increases, have also been agreed in principle, but some details need to be considered. The person in charge of the dock workers' union, in order to maintain social order and quell the disturbance, convened a meeting of all striking workers and, after repeated persuasion, resumed work yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Dyeing Factory Strike: The workers in the dyeing and silk finishing factories in the two concessions went on strike on the 30th of last month because the employers refused to improve their alcohol allowances. Subsequently, relevant parties sent personnel to mediate and persuaded the labor side to resume work first and then negotiate. In the previous (3rd) day, the labor and management parties negotiated and completely agreed on the increase of alcohol allowances. The increase methods were divided into four types: 3 cents, 5 cents, 12 cents, 8 cents, and 4 cents.</p>
<p>Four Major Hotels: More than 1,000 employees of the four major hotels and apartments, including Cathay Hotel, Duchen Hotel, Cathay Apartments, and Hamilton Apartments, went on strike on the 18th of last month to discuss service guidelines. The Industry and Social Affairs Department of the Public Works Bureau, in response to the requests of both labor and management, and in order to eliminate disputes, sent personnel to mediate impartially. The representatives of both parties frankly and openly negotiated in a harmonious manner. With the mediation of the representatives of the authorities, all conditions were revised and approved item by item. The representatives of both parties were satisfied, so the labor-management dispute that lasted for half a month has now been satisfactorily resolved. The employees of the four major hotels all went to resume work at 12 o'clock yesterday, and the situation was very good. As for the 23 workers arrested by the police in the two concessions, it is said that the employers have also tried to bail them out.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>After reviewing the "Local News" column of your newspaper on August 30th, which contained a news item entitled "Judge of the Special First Court Broadcasting," it seems to refer to the fact that I was invited to give a lecture at the Shipping Radio Station. I deeply feel that the words in the reply to the reporter are not well considered, so I hereby clarify the truth in order to correct the audience's understanding. Originally, Li Quan was in the Second Special District Local Court. After the retreat in November last year, he was transferred to the First Special District Local Court by order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court issued Instruction No. 5553 to inform him to report to the court and notify the First Special District Local Court. Although he was unable to work in the court due to environmental reasons, his position was indeed confirmed and the ministerial orders are still valid and can be verified. This time, Director Wu of the Shipping Radio Station, in view of the fact that rental disputes in Shanghai are everywhere, thought of clarifying the contents of the law in order to provide correct guidance and reduce unnecessary disputes. I was honored to be invited by Li Quan to broadcast. Wu Gongbao's enthusiasm for education is admirable, and Li Quan also believes that academics should be open to the public, and that laws related to people's lives should be the same. It is a small matter to refuse, but it is right to accept. Therefore, I immediately agreed, and on the same day, I only explained the legal regulations, selected the main points, and did not express opinions on the cases I was handling. Fortunately, the full text of the broadcast was recorded in detail on the spot by Mr. Shen Wenbin, which can be made public and does not violate the orders of the Ministry of Law. Judging from the letters sent by the citizens afterwards, praising it as a guide to the lost, it is indeed unworthy, but the citizens' demand for the instillation of legal knowledge and their desire to solve difficulties are earnest, which shows that the past concept of "the people can be made to follow, but not to know" is enough to harm the legal interests of the people, and is no longer tolerated by modern countries ruled by law. Li Quan is not talented, but only likes to serve the public and has never considered his own gains and losses. This broadcast was also based on this purpose, and he thought he had nothing to do with anyone, but he was criticized. Thinking deeply in the quiet night, he could not understand why. Now that the national crisis is at its height, and the storm has not subsided, we should still help each other in the same boat, and we will eventually succeed. I have always admired your newspaper's upholding of justice and safeguarding of laws and regulations. I respectfully express my sincere words and state the facts in order to clarify right and wrong and correct the audience's understanding.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Jiang Liquan</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3 id="e59">Grain: Foreign rice and Ke Xian rice both arrived in Shanghai. How can the rice market row against the current? Yesterday, it saw a sharp drop of three to four yuan. <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson's Fushan wheel arrived in port yesterday morning, carrying 2,577 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and was unloading at Roosevelt Wharf. Also, the Qiongzhou wheel arrived from Siam with 5,997 bags of foreign rice. Also, Swire Company's Hanyang wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 540 bags from Hong Kong, which will be unloaded today. The Java Mail Ship Company's Chili Bowl wheel arrived in port yesterday afternoon, carrying more than 2,200 bags of foreign rice from Java, and was unloading at the Puxiangdong Blue Chimney Wharf. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>After the opening of the foreign rice market yesterday, it showed a strong selling atmosphere, and the situation seemed to be on the verge of collapse. The large inventory, the arrival of the peak season, the clearance price, and the arrival of Ke Xian rice were all very unfavorable. 350 bags of newly arrived Wu Xin Xian rice opened at only 95 yuan to 93 yuan, which is 20 yuan less than the price of 115 yuan a month ago. It is also said that there is still a whole ticket waiting to be loaded in Wuhu. Although this statement has not been verified, it has caused more panic. Outside speculators first lowered prices to sell, followed by floating households, and the market fell sharply. Xiaojiao rice was as low as 107 yuan, which is more than 10 yuan less than the price of the Public Works Bureau's public sale. Yinghua Si was 135-6 yuan, Siam No. 2 was 125 yuan, Saigon No. 1 was 139.5 yuan, and broken rice was 93 yuan, all of which were 2-3 yuan to 4-5 yuan less than the previous market. There were also Chinese and foreign merchants selling Xiaojiao at 139 yuan, and the market was so sluggish. Only 7,000 bags and 400 tons were traded. At the close of the spot market, No. 1 Saigon was 122 yuan, which was determined to be 118 yuan, special 125 yuan to 123 yuan, No. 2 was as high as 115 yuan, second to 111 yuan, Siam No. 2 was as high as 110 yuan, decided to 105 yuan, Min Party was as high as 118 yuan, medium second was 112.5 yuan to 110 yuan, Yangon Jian was 120 yuan, the initial small pattern of the bank was 110 yuan, and then only 108 yuan, the outside bank was depreciated from 109 yuan to 107 yuan, and the broken Jian was as high as 85 yuan, decided to 78 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the thick and thin Geng rice should have fallen back because the new rice is coming out, because it cannot be transported to Shanghai, merchants still dare to hoard and sell it at high prices. However, affected by the sharp drop in foreign rice in recent days, the local stores have stagnated, and the owners have found it difficult to maintain the price. The selling price has also fallen by 2-3 yuan. Early rice in Kainang Port was 157 yuan and 155 yuan, Wuxi special Geng was 154 yuan, the general market was 150 yuan, 148 yuan, and the new Geng rice in Pudong was also the same, 157-8 yuan, special 160 yuan. Glutinous rice is also weak at this tired time, so the price has dropped uniformly by short yuan. Hong Kong white yuan opened as high as 125 yuan, and then fell to 118 yuan, special 127 yuan, and Lu 111-2 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Flour Transshipment Supports <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The early foreign flour market fell at the same time as foreign rice. The public was confused by rumors, and in view of the environment, major non-industry players first sought to sell. Jinlong Dongzhan was as low as 31.05 yuan, and Xizhan was 30.15 yuan, which was 7-8 cents less than the previous day. The fort was 31.78 yuan, which was also 2-3 cents less. Then, because local customers took advantage of the low price to absorb it, and the Japanese merchant transshipment group was particularly active, the market gradually recovered. The fort-American flour, with a small inventory, immediately returned to 32.12 yuan, and the Jinlong to Xizhan was 30.85 yuan, which was slightly higher than the previous market. Only the Dongzhan 31.3 yuan rice saw a sufficient increase, responding to 31.25 yuan, and the gold was 31 yuan. No less than 40,000 bags were traded, and the market was stable after a small opening. Bran and rice bran have opened at 33 yuan, and the market is also stable. However, wheat is out of stock and has not opened. Foreign wheat has a telegram that the cost of mixed flour is nearly 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Oil Market: Edible Oil Suddenly Changes in the Afternoon - Unprecedented Buying Spree <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, rapeseed oil and cottonseed oil dropped and rose sharply, and the changes were even greater. At first, the short-selling group still had the upper hand, and the selling atmosphere was strong. After the opening, the market was suppressed by 5-8 yuan. Then, the bulls also gradually became active, causing the market to stop falling and rise. In the afternoon, one party declared control of cottonseed in various producing areas, which shocked the public. The factory and the short sellers went in to make up for their losses, and the buying spree was unprecedented. The market rose sharply and directly. As a result, it rose by 6-7 yuan compared with the previous day. Tongshi sold more than 10,000 dan of Qingyou from Dayou Factory, more than 7,000 barrels of rapeseed oil from Rihua Factory, and a few sporadic Qingdao raw oil opened at 272-275 yuan, and Jiangbei listened to raw oil at 256 yuan.</p>
<p>The corn market has been sluggish for several days and has not improved for a long time. Yesterday, because Japanese merchants suddenly absorbed a considerable amount, the public was encouraged, and the market turned from tired to firm. It is estimated that more than 10,000 bags of Saigon and Dutch corn were sold, and the price was about one yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Yarn and Cotton: Factories Need Foreign Cotton to Obtain Foreign Exchange - The Cost of Fine Yarn Will Be Greatly Reduced <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Speculators Will Change Their Strategy and Turn to Coarse Yarn - The Japanese Yarn Ball Transaction Has Recently Seen Signs of Recovery</p>
<p>The trend of the yarn market is still hovering. It wants to rise but stops. This is because the sales of existing yarn are sluggish, and the acceptance of Hong Kong gangs is weak. In fact, the amount bought in the morning is not small, so it will stop temporarily, wait for digestion and then continue to do so. As for the 32-count single yarn, the past rising trend was inevitably violent. Secondly, the factory's profits were surprisingly high. Another saying is that if the factory applies for foreign exchange to purchase fine yarn raw materials from overseas, if it obtains a US exchange settlement of 5.3125 yuan, the cotton can be 100 yuan cheaper per pound. The cost of each package of fine yarn can be reduced by 4500 yuan. This situation is shocking. Therefore, the factors of mediocrity in recent fine goods. However, speculators in 20-count yarn have changed their strategy and are more lively and firm. The Japanese yarn ball transaction is gradually showing signs of recovery. The high price of 20-count Double Horse is 1,717 yuan, and the low price is 1,701 yuan. The initial opening price in the afternoon was 1,708 yuan. Then, it was heard that the transaction place had recovered, and it fell to 1,704 yuan. The closing price was 1,707 yuan, and the momentum was very weak.</p>
<p>The morning opening of Shuangma was mediocre, and the first price was 1,707 yuan. After a while, it rose to 1,709 yuan, but there were very few new buyers. Secondly, most of them could not go to the market, and the transaction was reduced by one step. It fell to 1,701 yuan. Later, it was heard that the opening of the trading place had risen and fallen, and people's minds were calm. It hovered at 1,706-7 yuan for a long time. Until the second round of the trading place recovered, the popularity was agitated, and buyers were active, and it rose to 1,716 yuan. However, the transaction of existing yarn was very rare, so the factory order was weak. Until the trading place closed, the yarn market was still high, but the bidding for the far month of standard cloth turned down, and Shuangma followed, and closed at 1,711 yuan. Later, it continued to be 1-2 yuan less. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 5,110 packages. The amount purchased by each gang is listed on the left,</p>
<p>Hong Kong 60, colleagues 4,500</p>
<p>Statistics 5,110</p>
<p>The Jin Shuangma futures market is quiet, and the ups and downs are increasingly narrow. The confusion of the ring image makes it difficult for those engaged in it to find clues, and the international exhibition is mixed with its many advantages and disadvantages, and it is impossible to grasp it. Households are holding back and watching, with very little initiative, so the market atmosphere is light, creating a hovering trend. When it opened in the morning, the September period was 1,615 yuan, the October period was 1,640 yuan, and the November period was 1,657 yuan, each with different differences. After entering, the factory order once rose by more than 10 yuan, and the period yarn also rose with the single. Throughout the day, the September period increased to 1,621 yuan, the October period increased to 1,648 yuan, and the November period was good to 1,665 yuan. Later, because scattered households sold out at high prices, it was compressed, but the hovering in the afternoon was relatively hard. However, there was no special transaction. As a result, the recent period closed at 1,617 yuan, a slight increase of 3 yuan, the October period was 1,643 yuan, also good for 2 yuan, and the November period was 1,658 yuan and 9 cents, which was slightly less than 5 cents. A total of 9,680 packages were traded throughout the day, a decrease of 5,760 packages compared to the previous. As of the evening of the 3rd, the number of accounts receivable for three months was 23,190 packages, including 6,920 packages for the September period, 8,910 packages for the October period, and 7,460 packages for the November period. Re-record the opening and closing high and low prices in one day (the net price is).</p>

<p>Investing in real estate is aimed at preserving capital and the interest rate is the thinnest, but the price increase has already been profitable. Now that the legal tender is so stable, it is advisable to change the strategy, get rid of the goods and seek wealth. It is difficult to have an accurate market in the Kou District real estate market and it is easy to suffer losses.

<h3 id="e64">China and India are on the Same Front - Ordering Cotton is More Convenient - It is Not Difficult to Apply for Foreign Exchange, but it Must Restrict Resale <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai cotton transaction market is lively, and trade is especially prosperous. This is because all parties are eager for goods, and the spot cotton situation is tight again and again. At the same time, ordering American cotton directly is much cheaper than spot goods. Because the United States and India are on the same side as China, Chinese merchants can easily obtain foreign exchange for purchasing American and Indian cotton. However, the situation in Shanghai is special, and it is deeply feared that the American cotton purchased will be used as "Mao Yanshou" and will flow to other places, which is not the way to maintain the yarn factory industry. Therefore, the procedures for applying for foreign exchange need to be strictly reviewed, and it must be guaranteed that the purchased foreign cotton will not be resold. However, the environment in Shanghai is not easy to monitor. On the one hand, it is to love the industry and facilitate it, and on the other hand, it is to prevent fraud, which is hard to guard against. Therefore, the order transaction of foreign cotton companies has reached its peak again in recent days. In fact, most of them are purchased by factories for their direct consumption, so they are beyond the reach of flower dealers. In summary, the total number of Brazilian cotton and California cotton sold by various foreign cotton companies seems to have reached about 2,000 bales yesterday, and flower dealers only accounted for one or two tenths of the total. It is expected that because the ship schedule is approaching Shanghai, and the selling price is only three-quarters of the spot cotton, there will be a more fierce competition in the next few days.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market first rose due to unfavorable weather reports and poor cotton production harvests. The buying price of the industry and merchants was more active, but then fell slightly due to some profit-taking. As a result, the closing price rose by about 12-16 pounds compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market first fell due to public settlements, but then rose slightly due to purchases by European exporters and short covering. Yesterday's closing price fell by about 2-5 Robi. It is also predicted that today's opening market will rise by 1.75 Robi.</p>
<p>Indian cotton has also been transferred from Hong Kong. Swire Company's Hanyang wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 1,713 pieces of Indian cotton from Hong Kong, and was unloading at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession.</p>
<p>The spot cotton situation has turned sluggish. It is nothing more than the excitement of the past, in fact, the price has reached its peak, so the buying and selling has been greatly reduced. However, foreign cotton has recently tended to rise again. There are occasional transactions of 20-count raw materials, but they are very rare.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Finance: Cotton Merchants Enter US Exchange in a Non-Negligible Amount <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed exchanges were all flat, and there was no change in the small counter price of the US bank. The black market of British and American exchanges continued to show hardening in stability, and finally saw Ping. Foreign banks such as American merchants were willing to supply, resulting in the US exchange rate of 4.875 once being able to be settled. However, after 10 o'clock, import foreign companies saw that it was cheap and slightly went in to pick up, so it eased a little. The British gold of 28,593,750 was also difficult to settle. The British exchange rate was soft to 4.8125. Although it was slightly hardened at noon, it softened again in the afternoon. The closing price was flat with the previous day's price. The transaction was not strong throughout the day. It was heard that cotton merchants picked up the US dollar at 4.8215, which was not a small amount.</p>
<p>The Morning Market is Quite Loose</p>
<p>Since the morning foreign electricity silver market, only Indian silver has increased slightly in the near future, and the rest and the US and India have not changed. The opening selling price of the bank in the early market was, spot British exchange 28,437,500, US dollar 4.8125, and foreign banks were slightly willing to supply after opening, and the trend was loose. A US dollar of 4.84375 has been settled. The HSBC list has not changed, and the silver balance tax is still levied at 24.50%. Foreign banks mutually made spot US dollars 4.875, so in the light of 10 o'clock, according to the above price, it was once so hard that it could be settled, and the US dollar also hardened to 28,593,750. Huashang issued a favorable Hong Kong exchange rate of 19.125, also loose. Soon, the import foreign companies saw that the low price was 4.84375, when it was seen that the return was soft to only 4.8125, the noon closing was 4.84375, and the British gold was 28,437,500.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market is Stable</p>
<p>I did not hear about opening for business in the afternoon, and the market was very stable. Until the 4 o'clock close, the US dollar was 4.8125 for settlement, and the British gold was 28,437,500, which were the same as the closing prices of the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market was ablaze. October futures began trading ahead of schedule, with the settlement price determined by the disparity between the HSBC small counter's US dollar rate and the black market US dollar rate. The market price was around $6,880, but due to strong bullish sentiment, the opening price was $6,930, triggering active short selling, especially from the Chaozhou gang and Yifeng, which sharply declined to $6,860. After 10:00 AM, fluctuations decreased, hovering around $6,880. The afternoon saw even lower prices, with a difference of only $15. Overall trading was lackluster. However, cash transactions suddenly became active, with 700-800 taels changing hands. Prices plummeted. Yongfengyu initially sold 20 taels to Tianyuan at $9,160, a decrease of $2. Subsequently, Defu sold 20 taels to Tianyuan at $9,130, and another 40 taels at $9,120. Chengji sold as low as under $9,100. Defu (Fuxin) then sold 30 taels at $9,090 and 20 taels at $9,080.

<p>In the public bond grey market, the opening yesterday seemed to have an upward trend, followed by a rush of sellers, which immediately turned the market downward. The lowest price for Class C was found to be $70.015. Subsequently, the strong buying force of Yuanchenghao brought the price back up by half a cent. The $70 mark was never broken, showing the strength of the buying line. However, tight credit currently, with overnight interest rates as high as 1.1 cents, seems slightly unfavorable to the buyers. Yesterday morning, Yitai and Yongyuan were the most active buyers, and Hongda and Yuxing were also determined buyers. The market price for Class C approached the $1 mark, but Dazhong and Shenchang were very active sellers, and Xiexingyuan and Lianyi also sold a lot. Class C suddenly dropped to $0.015. At the close, retail investors covered their short positions, and the price recovered slightly. In the afternoon, the market price rose slightly. Yuanchenghao suddenly made a large purchase. Yitai and Hongda added to their long positions, and Runde also showed interest. On the selling side, Shenchang continued to release spot goods, and Hu Heji and Tongshun Tiansheng also sold a lot. In the afternoon, the price recovered due to Yuanchenghao's large purchases. As a result, Class D and E bonds, due to the large drop the previous day, recovered by 5 cents and 1 cent, respectively. The rest remained down by 1.5 to 4 cents. The total transaction volume was approximately $1,670,000. A simplified summary is provided below.</p>

<h3 id="e81">"A Warty Head Child?" <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Chang</p>
<p>"A warty head child? Home is best." This saying is a truth and can express the hearts of parents all over the world. Children are originally "good." Rousseau said, "Children have no moral evil." Parents love them precisely out of instinct.</p>
<p>Life is so difficult on the isolated island now. A group of brokers carry such a heavy burden that they are naturally uncomfortable all the time. They vent at home, blaming their families and hating having too many children. They can think of a theory to ridicule themselves: believing that having two thousand dollars in hand is better than a child. Children need to eat, wear, use, and even be educated. This burden is really heavy. But occasionally, when they are too troubled, they will see a child babbling and dancing, and they will throw their troubles to the sky. If a child is sick, they will be anxious and restless. Even if it costs 100,000 Adu to make the child better, they will not hesitate. It doesn't matter if they are so poor that they have to complain. Where does this "contentment in all things" mentality come from? It's just nature. We may think it's funny at first glance, thinking it's a bit "unfathomable"; but upon careful reflection, it does offer an inspiration that makes people respectful: the continuation of a family and the infinity of a nation are both built on this nature.</p>
<p>There are no parents who are not good. Raising children is a natural duty and has no utilitarian value. Countless people sacrifice themselves for the survival of their children; there are very few who want their children to die for their own enjoyment.</p>
<p>If there are, then the parents have gone crazy. Rather than pitying their living conditions, it is better to hate their stupid actions. Children have the right to strive for their future. Why make children suffer by not living well when you yourself are ashamed that you can't give birth to them well? Let the children suffer and create on their own after a period of education, and society will progress. This problem of education is still a basic condition. I dare not believe that a diligent family, gritting their teeth and enduring hardship, really has no porridge to eat.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Typhoid Fever, Singer, and Arseal <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Wenling</p>
<p>Tight budgets inevitably lead to overspending; Vitamin M can be exchanged for Vitamin C.</p>
<p>When we thought that a little material enjoyment might make our small family more lovely, we decided to implement a two-year plan, taking out 5% of our monthly income to save up, ready to buy two lovely things that would increase our happiness after two years - a small Arseal and a beautiful Singer sewing machine. The former was what I dreamed of, and the latter was also something I longed for.</p>
<p>The plan went very smoothly, and as the amount of money increased, our joy also increased. What we saw before us was a picture of family happiness about to be completed - with my wife sewing clothes and me reading under the beautiful music from the radio.</p>
<p>However, unexpected things are difficult to predict. The outbreak of the war gave us a big blow: although salaries had been increased twice, they were still far from keeping up with the soaring prices. Therefore, every month we always felt that we were not making ends meet, and we were in a tight spot. At this time and place, every penny had its special use.</p>
<p>During the first month of being in trouble, we thought about using the money, but when we thought about how long it had taken to save it, we finally endured it. After struggling through a month, we never thought about turning to this idea again, no matter how difficult it was.</p>
<p>Although we would never spend money on things that were not necessary at this time, we always felt that we had some connection with these two things, because we still had some money after all.</p>
<p>Before we knew it, Zhen'er got sick. After seeing a doctor, we were told that she had typhoid fever, could not move, and needed to recuperate slowly. She could not eat any residue. Otherwise, it would end immediately. It was best to drink juice squeezed from Florida tangerines. We knew that Florida tangerines were very expensive, but perhaps because we loved our daughter so much, we immediately thought of using the money for Zhen'er's medical and living expenses.</p>
<p>Although we rarely patronized fruit stores, we knew that at that time, if you bought Florida tangerines, you would usually ask how much they were per pound. If you asked to buy one, you would seem a bit stingy. After rushing in, I naturally asked how much they were per pound. The reply was: this kind is one yuan and one cent per piece, and that kind is one yuan and six cents. I thought the shopkeeper would report the price per piece because he didn't think I could afford it, right? Because I had just shaved my neck and was wearing an Indian silk, I asked myself that I looked quite radiant. For Zhen'er's sake, I had to buy them even if they were more expensive. Since I had made up my mind to buy them, and with a bit of a retaliatory meaning, I puffed out my chest and said loudly: the big ones, the ones that are one yuan and six cents each, give me ten!</p>
<p>As such, Zhen'er ate five to six tangerines every day. With sufficient vitamin C supplementation, she recovered quickly. However, from then on, our ambiguous relationship with Singer and Arseal was written off.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e83">Casual Notes from the Xinan Caotang: The Ullambana Festival (3) <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>Chinese Taoists originally came from shamans. However, since Buddhism entered China, with its profound and extensive scriptures, it has gained the belief of the scholar-official class (also known as the intellectual class). Therefore, Chinese Taoists have stolen its form and performed food offerings to hungry ghosts, taking the business of monks, that is, the practice of water and fire salvation.</p>
<p>Buddhism has Guanshiyin Bodhisattva, who saves people from suffering, Taoism also has Taiyi Saving Suffering Heavenly Venerable. Many monks are now acting "absurdly," and the absurdity of Taoists is even worse than that of monks, even using the help of silk strings to sing small tunes and lewd words. Is this really the way to please ghosts and gods? However, the fifteenth day of the seventh month as the Zhongyuan Festival comes from Taoism. Taoism worships the Three Officials the Great Emperor, with the fifteenth day of the first month as the Shangyuan Festival, the fifteenth day of the seventh month as the Zhongyuan Festival, and the fifteenth day of the tenth month as the Xiayuan Festival. During the Tang and Song dynasties, lanterns were lit and offerings were made, so those who worshiped them were many. The fifteenth day of the seventh month is the Zhongyuan Festival because it is the Earth Official, so it transcends the souls of the dead. In the old days, the City God Fair, which was held three times a year, also sacrificed at the Tai Li Altar to transcend the lonely souls without worship. Its purpose is similar to that of the Flame Mouth Food Offering. In the City God Fair, there was a tall foot card stating that it was dedicated to worshiping lonely souls (the original wording cannot be remembered). The "dedicated" in this means it was dedicated under the order of Emperor Taizu of Ming. Because Emperor Taizu of Ming's parents died and did not know where they were buried, in the third year of Hongwu, he made a system to sacrifice at the Tai Li Altar, which was held on Qingming Day, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, and the first day of the tenth month. Seven days in advance, a proclamation was sent to the City God (hence the "dedicated" word). On the day of the sacrifice, the City God was placed on the altar, and the gods of the lonely ghosts were placed on the east and west sides of the altar, with three sheep, three pigs, and three stones of rice as offerings. Later generations only performed the form, forgetting their ancestors. What is seen in customs is more than just the Li sacrifice!</p>
<p>However, why extract out of context, not calling it the Ullambana Festival, but calling it the Lanpen Grand Assembly? This is also the accumulation habit of Chinese literati, who only know that the words are beautiful, regardless of the meaning. Ullambana is a transliteration, and it is difficult to divide it. However, the character "Yu" is removed, leaving only the character "Lan", probably because the characters "Lanpen" still feel elegant. Sui Hua Ji Li Yun: "Taoist gates are covered with treasures, offered in Zhongyuan. Buddhist Lanpen, is grand on this day." Is this the origin of the abuse of the words "Lanpen Grand Assembly"?</p>

<p>— Mu Ping</p>
<p>Although this year's lunar calendar has an extra leap June, time passes really quickly, and in another month, it will be Mid-Autumn Festival again.</p>
<p>Thinking of Mid-Autumn Festival, one thinks of Mid-Autumn mooncakes, and even more of Mr. Xian Guansheng, the boss of Guanshengyuan, who is most active during Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Once, I was chatting with him about his attitude towards his employees. He said to me with a very humorous attitude: "I am a craftsman myself, I know their situation, and my attitude towards them has only two main points: to make sure they can eat their fill and sleep soundly."</p>
<p>When I heard his seemingly funny but not funny words, I felt that I had never heard of such a thing. Eating one's fill, of course, means improving the treatment of employees, but what about sleeping soundly? I couldn't help but ask him to explain it further.</p>
<p>He said: "I am in the food industry. If they can't eat their fill, what can't they use biscuits or sponge cakes to fill their stomachs? If that's the case, my losses would be too great, so I want to make sure that all my employees can eat their fill. A person who can't sleep at night, if he is a shop assistant, will not have the energy to deal with customers during the day, and if he is a worker, he may cut his finger when cutting the cake. These are the dangers of not being able to sleep. Why can't he sleep? Either because of economic problems, or because he likes to live a dissolute nightlife. If it is because of economic problems that he can't sleep, this is the responsibility that the employer should fulfill. If it is because he likes to live a dissolute nightlife that he can't sleep, then he is asking for trouble, and I have no way to protect him."</p>
<p>Although these words are simple, they are extremely insightful.</p>
<p>Now, there are too many people who can't eat their fill and can't sleep soundly. I hope that employers will have the same mentality as Boss Xian, and at the same time, I also hope that employees will also examine their own lives during this extraordinary period. If they can barely manage to eat their fill and sleep soundly.</p>

<p>"Looking for it, what Third Master said is right. They must know about the girl." Xiao Gouzi also said with gritted teeth. "Just because they couldn't accept her as a disciple, they tricked people away. Is there still law and order in this world! But Third Master, we have few people, they have many people, and we haven't obtained any real evidence. If you go to reason with them now, I'm afraid you'll just be wasting your time."</p>
<p>"According to you, what should we do?" Although Begonia was in a rage, she didn't want to be reckless, so she stopped and began to hesitate.</p>
<p>Chen Da, the school worker sent by the county middle school, was also an enthusiastic person. When he heard them say this, he immediately threw away the half-smoked cigarette in his hand and walked between Xiao Gouzi and Begonia.</p>
<p>"That's okay." He looked from Xiao Gouzi's face to Begonia's face. "That day, the person they sent, I still remember very clearly. As long as you take me to see the suspicious family, I can definitely recognize him."</p>
<p>When Begonia and Xiao Gouzi heard this, they both thought it was a good idea. (203)</p>

<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Watching the Movie "Slaying Jing Tang"</p>
<p>In addition to studying old operas, I also like to watch movies, both Chinese and Western, and I am especially interested in movies adapted from our country's old dramas. When "Slaying Jing Tang" starring Zhou Xinfang and others was first performed three years ago, I went to see it and felt it was okay, but I didn't have time to criticize it. Recently, this film has been re-released, so I specially watched it again. Overall, it is quite successful and has its merits, which I will list below:</p>
<p>(1) The combination of new and old methods is used, such as the scenery, mountains, rocks, trees, distant city walls, halls, sutra halls, tents, banners, incense candles, all use real objects, while the protagonist and supporting actors, four or five people, singing, dialogue, acting, and costumes, still maintain the old techniques and forms of the stage. This is a mixed usage of realistic art and abstract art. Sometimes real horses are used to gallop, but the protagonist Wu Han still uses a saddle to simulate the horse's movement. The fighting also uses old forms, which is also a mixture of real and fake. I have thought about it, the adaptation of old dramas into movies, the combination of new and old, is a certain process, and there is no other way. But Zhou Xinfang's last shot in the fire should have used a real horse to show his greatness. Now he still doesn't use a real horse, and one person on the entire screen has the disadvantage of being short and small, I am afraid that Xinfang wanted to show off his skills in picking fire, which is inevitable a flaw.</p>
<p>(2) The use of people, objects, and time in the film is very economical and commendable. For example, Wu Han promised his old mother three major things: The first thing is to release Liu Xiu, only Wu Han went out and gave the order. At this time, Liu Xiu and others were re-printed riding real horses on their backs. The second thing is to change the flag, also using the previous method, (The flag of overthrowing Wang Mang should be replaced with a Chinese character flag. Liu Xiu's side should be researched, what is the form and pattern? Unfortunately, this point in the film is too simple, the time is too short, and the dialogue between Wu's mother and Wu Han is not clear enough, so ordinary people cannot easily understand. These three major things are the core of the whole play, and should be clear and powerful.) Also, this film does not use servants, dragon sets, and few subordinates, which is very economical in terms of manpower and can be used as a method. The above is about its advantages.</p>
<p>There are also shortcomings, such as Zeng Yin's lack of clarity, which is not tragic enough, and Wu's wife, Wu's mother, Liu Xiu, etc., lack expression and unclear dialogue. This is unacceptable even in old dramas, let alone in movies? In the future, I hope that Chinese films, especially films adapted from old dramas, will pay more attention to dubbing.</p>

<p>— Jie Sheng</p>
<p>Since hearing "Shi Yin"'s very successful concert at the Russian Art Theater last month, who wouldn't be concerned about "Shi Yin"'s news? In fact, they have always been thinking about the audience, running around every day to negotiate with theaters, rush to print tickets and programs, and intensify practice. Now everything is ready, the location is borrowed from the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge, and the time is 8 o'clock in the evening on the 5th, 8th, and 9th of this month for three days. The program is very rich and includes many new works. The ensemble includes a collection of Russian folk music, lullabies, short pieces, and interludes from "The Prisoner of the Caucasus"; the solos include hunting songs and scherzo dances; the solos include Chen Luo's Volga Boatman's Song and Zhang Hao's two famous old Russian songs.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that the chorus, in addition to the previous chorus pieces such as Lark, Floating Clouds, Fugitive, Shepherdess, Dunaevsky's Song, the opera "The Bloodshed of Heroes", "The Virgin Soil Upturned" and the interlude from "Quiet Don", also added many recently re-arranged famous songs.</p>
<p>As for the tickets, they are still set very low in order to popularize them to the general public.</p>

<p>— Mu Feng</p>
<p>It has been said that Violet is trying to make a comeback in Hong Kong, but apart from rumors, there has been no factual performance. A few days ago, the reporter met Wang Juelong, who had just come to Shanghai from Hong Kong, and got a confirmed message:</p>
<p>"Violet has decided to star in a film in the short term, and the collaborator is Jin Yan. The reason for inviting Jin Yan to collaborate is of course to raise Violet's status and enhance her appeal. Jin Yan has already accepted it. In addition, Violet has completely received the help of powerful people this time. This powerful person is Violet's close lover, so he invested 100,000 yuan, and the momentum is quite magnificent."</p>
<p>Once, it was said that Jin Yan was preparing to produce at his own expense, and planned to invite Wu Yonggang to go south to serve as the director. Wu Yonggang cooperated with the three parties, and Chen Yunshang and Jin Yan cooperated. Zhang Shankun, the owner of Guolian, also invested some money. However, this news is currently difficult to confirm. As for the cooperation between Jin Yan and Violet, it is completely two different paths and is not related.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 16 Taking a Delicate Bird Out of the Cage Early</p>
<p>I worry day and night, praying to Heaven, so that the courtiers will be loyal and the three armies will be ordered to quickly eliminate Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng and others, so as not to cause the people to suffer and overthrow the country. How can I have the heart to get close to women and indulge in extravagance, so that I will be burdened with a bad name for thousands of years? Therefore, my heart is only on the people of the world, and I only ask that the people not suffer from the disaster of war and quickly quell the chaos, then I will die with my eyes closed. I dare not be a sequel to Sui Yang and Tang Ming, I have to live up to your kindness, and I still ask you to send it back to your father's mansion." Concubine Tian heard the emperor say this, and she did not dare to ask again, and felt guilty. So she went to talk to Yuanyuan, sent someone to send Yuanyuan back to her father's mansion, and told her father the general situation. Tian Hongyu was both happy and worried when he heard it. He was happy that the pearl had returned to Hepu, and the beauty had come back. He was worried that his daughter's hard work had been wasted, and he still failed to relieve the emperor's worries. So he went to comfort Yuanyuan a few words. Yuanyuan sighed that her fate was in the hands of the old man, and she wanted to commit suicide. However, because Tian Hongyu was very vigilant, she did not get the chance. One day, the maid was not by her side in the morning, so she hanged herself. She took a Luandai belt, tied it to the head of the bed, and was about to throw herself into the noose when sunlight shone in through the window, reflecting a dressing mirror behind her back, which was very bright. She accidentally turned her head and saw her beautiful shadow in the mirror. Sure enough, she was graceful and charming, just like the Tang poem said, "A branch of rich beauty condenses fragrance," how could she bear to abandon it once? Her heart could not help but soften a bit, thinking to herself that she was more beautiful than a flower, why was her life as thin as paper? Could it be that she would never have a chance to stand out in her life? She felt a little unwilling in her heart. She thought to herself, how could the sky above give birth to a person with such a beautiful heart, but make me fall into the dust and suffer? She couldn't believe it herself. So, in a flash, she hesitated and retreated, unwilling to die in a ditch. Just then, Tian Hongyu walked into the room, and was shocked when he saw this scene! (160)</p>
