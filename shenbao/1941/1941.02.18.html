<h3>英美兩大海軍國家　共同防衛遠東前哨　英宣布新加坡埋雷區界線　增強海空根據地阻日南侵</h3>
<p>倫敦　英海軍部宣布新加坡海峽東面入口處海面敷雷後、船舶欲駛過該區者、必須向英海軍當局請示路綫、敷雷區界綫北為北緯〇二·四四度、東為東經〇四·三〇度、南為北緯〇一·三五度、西為馬來海岸、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　非官方人士昨分析海軍部之文吿稱、馬來半島東南區域之敷設水雷、有效地將由泰國、中國、越南及日本至新加坡之主要路綫加以阻塞、此間認為、此種措置、乃再進一步增強該處之海空根據地、此間並認為、此項舉動、乃企圖使本週內因日本或將隨德國春季總攻實行南進而起之緊張局勢、趨於寬弛、安不可破之新加坡要隘、最近已由皇家空軍白蘭罕轟炸機及澳洲轟炸機數隊加以增防、觀察家相信、英國遠東軍總司令樸芳到達澳洲之舉、亦足表示英帝國進一步與澳洲合作、以防衛英國之遠東前哨、此間認遠東局勢尚有一間接之重要點、即據傳日本正與泰、越進行談判、企圖在該兩處取得空軍根據地是也、惟央人之驚惶、已因英·泰之互不侵犯條約及泰方公報謂對英之「甚佳關係、仍未遭受損害」而稍感安慰、英方評論家預測、日本如向新加坡有所行動、則英·美勢處合作加以應付、星期日泰晤時報云、世界上兩最大海軍國英·美·將站在同一綫上、以防衛馬來亞、而抵抗日本侵略、乃屬明顯之至、該報又云、日本或夢想英國海軍無力東顧、美國海軍亦未必參加、果爾、日本勢將有好夢突然破碎之一日焉、（十七日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>中英軍事密約說</h3>
<p>去年十二月九日，中國國民政府與重慶英國大使館，對於日方所傳英大使在重慶正與中國政府談判秘密軍事協定的消息，各發正式聲明，予以切實否認。隔了兩月有餘，東京又於日前盛傳同樣消息，據稱中英正在磋商中的軍事協定，企圖維持英國在遠東的勢力，並阻止日本南進；協定內容將包括中國政府與星加坡成立一聯合防綫，以對抗日本的南進活動，並增加美國取道滇緬路運華軍火的供給。到記者選此題材的時候，尚未聞中英兩國當局對此消息作何否認；因此關於這所謂密談中的一切，局外人自無從懸揣所傳的信有可徵，抑或盡屬子虛。茲不問所傳爲虛爲實，亦不問中英當局對此消息否認默認或是認，或予不理，然有足評述者。</p>
<p>最近兩三月來的國際，並無足以震驚世人的何種具體變故，然逐步逐步的演化却無日不在進展之中。從今日回想去年十二月上旬的國際空氣，旣可謂今非昔此了：英德在海峽的對抗作戰由長期的膠着而英國更形穩定，在地中海兩岸的會戰局面則義大利每况愈下近乎不能招架；中國在河南方面，打破了日方大規模的攻勢；日本的南進活動。從軍事政治外交乃至經濟種種方面，從事於露骨的鬥爭佈局：美國由國務卿赫爾與總統羅斯福二氏先後闡明美國必然的行動，而相借法案亦已突破了幾重難關，將到實施階段；這些事態正在繼續不斷的推移，使大天注視消息的人們反而不覺得局墊的漸變，好像天天見面的人疏忽了彼此漸肥漸瘦。在這短短期間，尤足綜合提示的，莫如英國從緬旬馬來星加坡以迄澳洲，公然强化其防務；荷屬東印度婉轉曲折的宣示其拒絕加入所謂東亞共榮圈，並決心以武力抵抗侵略；美國由種種表示之中，表示了至少對於星加坡與荷印的絕不放鬆絲毫；，這幾點，象徵着南太平洋反侵略防綫的完成。在兩個月前，誰也不能無所保留而作此肯定的說法。</p>
<p>不但如此，還有可以大書特書的。據路透社東京電訉所傳，美國總統羅斯福氏在日本野村大使投遞國書時所作談話，於一般應對之外，羅氏『重申美除參戰以外，將繼續以一切可能手段援助英國之意嚮，並力言美國對華之深切關懷，已因相信中國與歐洲戰事已成整個戰爭之一部而益見增加』云云，假定所傳眞是曲達了當時談話的本旨，假定我們解釋而不謬，則羅氏身爲美國當局。亦國際權威，茲乃確指歐亞兩組戰爭乃爲整個戰爭的一部，無殊謂兩戰一體，對日作此諷示，此其意　的深長，及其可能的關連所及，影響所及，可謂遠大之至。茲姑不必奢陳怎樣關連，怎樣影響，然中英兩國今後的痛癢相關，休戚相共，在中國方面早已若此體認明白，而英國於恢復其抗德的自信之後對此亦能深切感悟，今則更由羅斯福總統爲之從旁道破。</p>
<p>惟其然，關於所謂中英軍事秘密協定的消息，無論其是否已經簽訂於秘密之中，或確在磋商擬議之中，或兩國當局確猶議未及此，或既熟商而見解參差竟無成議，然在南大平洋爆發戰爭之日，兩國必因事實上的相需之殷亟而互助合作。此則即使沒有密約，殆已成爲兩國人士的心頭默契。嘗讀美人某氏的軍事論文，指出緬甸馬來與泰國法越一帶，假定發生戰爭，勢必有關全局，其論甚是：到那時候，中國軍隊絕對無疑義的是其間具有決定性的大宗力量！</p>

<h3>英軍官西綫日記</h3>
<p>看來英軍已決定撤退。重大的軍實損失是不可避免的了。德軍不斷轟炸海峽各港。鄧扣克常有雨點似的炸彈落下。如果英軍眞的準備撤退，那末愈早愈好。今天法方計劃在北路聯軍陣綫的南端安排撤退。我以爲這就是第一階段終了的起始。他們也許想把聯軍的全部三十師至三十五師由海道撤退到吉蓬。據我看來，這是不可能的。</p>
<p>下午五時：比利時惡消息傳來，齊爾脫·路勒·伸納至倍開綫已在破裂了。</p>
<p>我方最可痛心的是士無鬥志。這也許是二十年來國聯大唱高調的結果。這也是我們失敗的一個主要原因，我們不像敵方高喊國家第一的口號。</p>
<p>希望愈來愈渺茫了。</p>
<p>五月二十八日上午八時三十分：無甚重要消息。某軍官被留在勒杜克，早晨起身，發現德軍已佔領該地。他今天告訴我有趣的逃生經歷。他的妻子是法國人，他呢也住在法國多年，所以他很容易化裝法國漁人。他在德軍佔領該鎭的頭四天留在鎮上。德方在波洛業。拉杜克·阿倍維爾一區好像並沒重兵固守，祇有少數士兵在市區往來巡邏。阿倍維爾也沒有戰車侵入。各地祇有少數兵士駕着機器脚踏車守在十字路口，間或有一二處機關槍而巳。他對我說，這一區裏藏着的法事人數和德軍是五與一之比。德車態度極好，他們把通行證發給各種做生意的人自由出入。</p>
<p>這位軍官招集了幾名留下的英軍交通人員，駕了一艘小舟回來，他又對我說，區內穿着制服的法軍，來來往往的很多，當然都沒有軍械。他們已把步槍拋掉了。有人聽見一個兵十說，如果他們的長官沒有逃跑，還有人率領的話，他們可以立刻把那些德軍包圍殲滅</p>
<p>這次戰事，簡直太古怪了。缺乏作戰信念，優柔寡斷，尤其遇事不肯認眞。在法國這次戰事是不會長久的。</p>
<p>上午九時三十分：極度恐慌。比王利奧波特屈服的消息傳來了。詳情還沒有知道。</p>
<p>下午六時五十分：知道詳情的人，聽見廣播的戰事消息，很覺得難過。電合中又是政治家發表着慷慨的言論，又講起北路我軍作戰的英勇事蹟，可沒人相信了。</p>
<p>目前的問題祇在北路聯軍究能撤退多少。邱吉爾首相說也許在這星期杪，他纔能宣佈確訊。這就是說還有四天。</p>
<p>我想我們在這裏躭擱不會長久了。法軍最多祇能支持二十一天。他們並不誠心誠意在作戰。</p>
<p>五月二十九日上午六時三十分：昨夜吳道爾h校告訴我，法國第七軍被擊敗後，已潰不成軍。第九軍也不能作戰了。第一軍也不再存在了。除了馬奇諾防綫所　十師以外，法軍祇剩五十一師了。自阿勃維爾到巴黎一綫駐有十師。還有三十五師分配在蒙脫梅地到海岸一帶，防綫共長一百八十哩·</p>
<p>據說　軍在烟慕掩蔽之下，方作順利的撤退。運兵船已沈了一艘。</p>
<p>五月三十日上午十時：鄧扣克撤兵消息，比預期的尤爲滿意。巳經撤退了五萬二千人，海峽一帶如果仍有低雲籠罩，陰雨繼續不停，今夜還可以撤退二萬一千人。</p>
<p>據偵察機機師報告，法方在愛遜河沿岸並無準備，橋樑沒有炸斷，軍隊極少，又無大砲戰車，沒有戰壕，也不見有人挖掘，又沒有戰車陷阱，也沒有當得起障礙物三字的設備·</p>
<p>這和喬治將軍方面的情報完全相反。他說，愛納一綫防守極爲堅固。吳道爾和奧斯鮑羅出逃回來，證實了我們機師的報告。他們在路上祇碰見小隊哨兵瑟縮在不完備的防禦物後面。各處見不到機關搶陣地，也沒瞄準着的大砲，也沒劃定的警備這域。他們去訪問愛遜附近的營部，和長官談起這種情形。那營長是個不剃鬚，很骯髒，很矮小的人，不大像軍人。問他爲甚沒有壕溝。他說他所帶的兵是菲洲阿爾及利亞士人，阿爾及利亞人向來不掘戰壕的。這眞是阿爾及利亞人的不幸，但是他們所要保衛的國土所蒙的不幸，恐怕還要大呢，兩翼防務空虛的情形相差不遠。並沒有可以擋住德國戰車一秒鐘的障礙物。</p>
<p>對岸德軍很輕易地守着陣地。如果他們要過來，祇消從索遜和里色爾二處渡河，其實祇要照平時走路那般走過來就行了。</p>
<p>吳道爾和奧　鮑羅經過里　。他們說里姆像是死城一般，旣未被炸，也沒被砲轟；可是城內却沒一個活人。</p>
<p>愛納河兩岸鄉村　沒有人住了。他們問路旁的兵士，爲甚鄉村也和城市一般地沒人，他們指着天上，聳聳肩。由此可知轟炸所生出的恐怖心理，遠勝於一萬尊大砲哩。</p>
<p>五月三十一日十一時十五分：鄧扣克戰事之激烈，不下於一九一四年瑪爾納河之戰，不過情形完全不同罷了。據說普列烏將軍所部已衝破德軍陣綫，已與央國軍相合，一同爲鄧扣克撤退的軍隊作後衛。</p>
<p>狄爾將軍今日巳到這裏，大約就要採取最後決定了。法國現在的地位，是否應由英國增派生力軍來冒一下險？這就是應該決定的了。照我私人看來，可以不必。我們的目的在於擊敗德國。唯有英國一能達到這目的。英國如果分出一部不很充足的軍隊來支持戰敗的法國，必致同歸於盡。倒不如讓英國重振殘部，即使單獨作戰，終有一天能達到最後勝利，來解放法國。</p>
<p>六月三日下午四時十五分：大概在一時半的時候，我們正在吃點心，忽然聽到重轟炸機發出的可怕機聲。一共三批，每批五十架光景，在一萬呎高空飛過。也沒一架法方戰鬥機飛起迎製，直到最後一批安然飛過之後，十八架莫來式飛機中纔有一二架昇到三四千呎高空，漫無目的地開了幾槍。</p>
<p>聽說德國在開戰綫有第一錢飛機九千架。每月能製造一千五百架。我方戰鬥機在最初三星聽中損失很重。轟炸機並無損失。所以現在轟炸機的總數，正在不斷地增進着。</p>
<p>六月五日下午一時四十五分：十一時十五分接到消息，敵方已於今晨四時在索姆河亞眠。至貝隆綫採取攻勢。正午，敵方機械化部隊已突破數點。同時拉翁以西敵軍也沿瓦斯河向孝耐方面進攻。敵軍進展之速眞出人意外。</p>
<p>六月六日下午六時三十分：北戰塲消息惡劣。敵軍在西眠以東，洛愛以北集合。的戰車大概有八百到一千輛光景。看來將向貢比臬進攻。</p>
<p>六月七日上午十時十五分：巴黎爭奪戰已全部展開。今晨無甚可靠消息。全綫搖幌不定。各種變化都有發生的可能</p>

<h3>與美采取平行行動　英重申撤僑勸告　目前航運便利應早爲之計　英當局發登記表調查去留</h3>
<p>自本月十三日駐滬美總領事著、奉華盛頓國務院電令重申撤僑勸告後、遠東局勢、似已轉趨緊張、但各方承認美國此舉、並非放棄遠東權益、其日的無疑爲警告日本、表示堅決反對日本之南進、但日方則作安定人心之宜傳、以緩和美國在遠東之行動、詎前日英國大使館、亦以重申撤僑勸告聞矣、據某觀察家談、就遠東現狀而論、吾人實無須驚惶、蓋英國撤僑之舉、顯係與美國採取平行行動、證實英國殆已與美國採取聯合步驟、以制裁日本、</p>
<p>英大使館　重申勸告</p>
<p>路透社十七日上海消息、英大使館昨夜發出一文、交報紙披露、略謂、去年十月、英當局曾向詢問者勸告、任何英人未有居留之良好理由者、應考慮離去中國淪陷區之適宜性、此項勸告、今猶適用、去留之決定以及因此而起之佈置、必須依照自己環境而各自爲之、惟作此決定之際、有不可不了解者、在短時期中、欲獲得旅行之特殊便利、殆將爲不可能、且遠東航運、現已大减、海船艙位供應有限、船票須預先購定、此亦應予注意者也、</p>
<p>從事準備　自動撤離</p>
<p>據英大使館消息、去歲自撤僑令發出後、除一部英僑離滬、赴馬來亞各地從軍外、撤離中國境者、爲數甚少、以視美僑撤離人數、相差甚遠、良以彼等深知國際情勢與遠東情况、不至遽趨於惡化、益以生財與所有投資、故撤退者、爲數不多、惟本次再經當局重申前令後、各英僑勢將服從命令、作一切必要準備、自動撤離、</p>
<p>發登記表　塡報去留</p>
<p>英當局業已發出登記表、限各英僑塡就送館、說明理由、離去與否、應報告備核、其決意離去者、可乘在遠東行駛之央美船隻、或赴加拿大、或則逕行返國、即載貨輪隻、可就其他部份能容樓身之處者、亦可乘之歸國、遠東各地之英國總領事署、應發給證明文件、予僑民撤退之便利、惟據各英僑方面所獲私人消息、彼等成願遵令離去、輔助政府功令之推進、其留居淪陷區之僑民、此後將先後來滬集中、候輪撤退、</p>
<p>英僑團體　協助進行</p>
<p>英國旅滬僑民協會、英婦女協會、大英戰勝會等、以英政府當局、旣軍申撤僑命令、當以事關國家大計，未可聽任各僑胞於組織下撤離、爰將召集會議、迅速於嚴密組織下、幫同政府推進撤退工作、輔助不足、務期早見諸事實</p>

<p>對日展開　經濟戰爭</p>
<p>據消息靈通之金融界人十相　、本市美商銀行之所以將支票往來戶改爲活期儲蓄、祗許顧主直接向本市美商銀行及紐約總行提取之原因、爲對付日本而發、因日方已自海關及其他機關獲得大批法幣、換取美金、在上述二銀行開戶、彼等雅不願在紐約開戶也、商界人士雖認美商銀行此舉、將引起若干不便、然衆認此事對於本市商業、絕少影響、其他外商銀行是否將效法美商銀行、採取同樣辦法、昨日無法獲悉、美商運通銀行中人稱、彼等尚未接到紐約總行對　問題之訓令、各銀行若步武美商銀行之所爲而採取戒備辦法、則商人將無法取得美金、茍如是、則積儲法幣套售外匯之辦法、將全歸失敗、華方商界中人、對此舉殊表歡迎、因此舉對合法之中美貿易、甚爲有利、</p>

<h3>美匯凍結遍傳市塲　金市變動狂暴　期現價相差幾近三百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、起伏倐忽、變動驚人、午盤堅好、開盤由六千二百元、會達六千二百五十元、此因外匯鬆後回軟、祥興永·恒記·熾大等均進、雖中途賣風仍有、但至午收尚告六千二百零五元、後市匯票市塲遍傳、美國凍結資金之即將實行、美匯再長、是於賣風急劇、一瀉至六千零四十元低價、雖天成恒記等來進、回漲祇三十元、曾告六千零七十元、晚收爲六千零六十元、比上週末收市價軋小七十五兀、收後塲外曾做六千零四十五元、又現貨比期貨最高已達二百七十餘元、全日期貨交易約一萬兩、銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、終則平定、關金等亦平、</p>
<p>粭赤續跌七十五元</p>
<p>晨初以人心稍堅、買進者頗多、故開盤於祥興永等猛抬下、告六千二百元、比上週六做高達六十五元、而恒記及其他銀號搶撈下、不久續見上升、挺至六千二百五十元、終以外匯帶硬、匯票市塲仍有美國凍結資金之言、再聞本埠美銀行將改外幣活期存款爲儲蓄、以利凍結、賣風由此又起、計大　同康永順元等奮出、而供多求少中、拾級下退、未幾即進二百元關內、告六千一百五十五元、但因外匯忽有扒戶、價稍回軟、乃激動熾大·同永泰祥興永等來購、復被拖出六千二百元關外、升至六千二百四十元、不意滙票商見高仍懷撳塞之心、以維持缺乏、仍低至六千一百八十元、午收告六千二百零五元、午後開盤尚昂、爲六千二百二十五元、霎時好五元、曾到六千二百三十元、嗣後因從匯票市塲傳來之空頭消息、人心大受影響、如大豐·仁承永·新豐永莫不狂拋、竟速越二一百元關、直降至六千零四十元、雖此後天成恒記等買進、僅回高至六千零七十元、晚收祗六千零六十元、比上週末收軋跌七十五元、又現貨上午比期交高二百十餘元、午後聞已漲達二百七十五元、成交不多、全日期貨上落二百十元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤（現貨）高十數元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>

<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、上午九點三刻升十元、爲六百六十元、午後四時低十元、計大同行仍掛六百五十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元云、</p>
<h3>證券　公債漲跌互見　外股巳漲風</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市况仍在多空角逐中、高低仍有一元數角上落、雙方作最後之掙扎、究竟鹿死誰手、尚在未定之天、但在午後忽有謠言、外匯驟長、金子劇跌、人心又虛、形勢未見佳妙、故前途好面究屬有限、惟亦有謂現在游資集中上海、銀根鬆濫、拆息祇開七分、銀行紛紛减息、活期二三釐、洋商銀行並無利息、公債即等於現鈔、不讓銀行活期存款之便利、而戊種統債抽籤十二支起至甲種之三十六支止、一年二次、約計每百元票面權利四元八角、外加利息六元、兩共十元零八角、以平均市價六十五元計算、合息一分七釐弱、較之貿賣棉紗黃金之一跌數百元、安危逈異、因之有以爲如果太平洋有戰事、中國公債之前途、更形光明、故謂債市當不至終於低落者、昨日交易、上午信孚買進較多、仁昌仁豐次之、而賣戶以鴻大爲最多、協康潤　聯益恒康次之、故市價高至六十四元一角收盤、祇六十二元八角、午後信孚繼續買進、仍有餘勇、恒康新華昌記聯益次之、但鴻大仍有大批多頭出籠、餘如協昌信昌怡太同康潤利同興等均有賣出、市價又回好數角、競爭結果、一致繼續上漲二角至五角、惟乙種反小二角、成交總數約計二百五十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交冠生園股二十五股、價爲七十元正、</p>

<h3>糧食　米商最喜火藥氣　日軍圖南進替米商再造機會　洋米達限價粳米猛提三元許　但一看到源依然有四萬餘包</h3>
<p>洋米市自週前以南洋風雲日緊、推動市塲人心迭見暴漲、囤戶氣燄越高、搜進愈亟、蓋以來源中斷相恫嚇、其實日本尚不敢輕易嘗試、美央荷澳已有戒備、南進迷夢一時在武力重重之下、非歐局有大變動、不致爆發、但一般以此爲慮、故至昨日開市、漲風愈熾、在未開市以前、實銷爲謀先着、已在多方搜求、兼之浮囤散戶推波助浪、引得賣方心思更堅、扳俏益力、迄中市各貨價除中次者外、一律開抵限價、若小紋雖浦東棧亦達七十五元九角、此後市盤雖已碰壁、然賣氣仍旺、未稍退遜、一路蠭動異常、收盤猶堅、計一號西貢爲八十五元、中關八十四元至、八十三元半、二號八十元、次七十八元半、一號暹　八十五元至八十三元半、火絞八十四兀至八十三元、小絞七十六元八角七十五元半、敏黨米八十六元、大絞七十五元、米菉七十元至七十一元、碎尖六十七元至六十五元、蕪湖尖七十六元三角、觀夫上開各價較之週前又升元半光景、但途貨絡繹來滬、迄未中阻、而新定反以滙長通劃、合義洋行又有三月份小紋五千噸在市兜售、價八十八元、一說尚在電商船位、仍與前市相似、其他直接訂購者、據傳亦有多起在醞釀中、所以期路各米漲而復平、·結果比上週六祇較大四五角而已、開出回籠　華司1號西貢現九十九元半、二號九十二元四角、小絞現九十元〇一角至零五角、一月十五日裝船貨九十元、二月份八十八元二角、八十八元半、八十九元、二三月份八十八元三角、成交約近二千噸、現貨亦有一萬五千多包、</p>
<p>一觀洋米到貨依然大批連續而來、怡和洋行明生輪、前日（星期日）到滬、由香港運來二萬一千七百六十七包、停羅斯福碼頭起卸、太古公司濟南輪、亦於星期日抵埠、自港裝來四千六百四十九包、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、叉太古公司廣東輪、昨日上午到滬、由香港裝來七千六百二十七包、亦停法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、又有蘇州輪、亦昨午到埠、由香港運來九千五百零五包、暫停浦東、待今日移泊法租界外灘起卸、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、因天雨連綿、來源告斷、而適際市上謠　紛紜、洋米飛騰之問、人心尤覺激昂、貨稀爲貴、致貨主多奇貨自居、喊聲若狂、而店戶作客亦以亟於應需、見市貨不敷分配、備恐向隅、遂不以價格之昂貴、相互競購、於是市面成出於意外之暴烈漲風、若靑角斛見薄稻開九十九元至九十六元半、原包百零二元、竟猛提三元之巨、而崑山原白粳開百零八元至百零六元、斛見百零二元至一百元、特別百零四元、亦升二元左右、至於常幫特貨乏貨無市、</p>
<p>糯米實銷雖仍不暢、然一般大戶見各貨飛漲、而視糯價獨平、認堪圖利、、頗多囤收、以是售價一被吸引、亦相隨增高元許、開香港特元八十二元、普通八十一元、八十元、糯茶七十四五元、</p>
<h3>十餘萬粉到滬　市面先緊後回平</h3>
<p>麵粉昨洋粉市况、初緊後平、蓋自上週未日美風雲謠傳之後、莫不居奇、囤購頗不乏人、上午開盤、在米價昂貴聲中、現洋粉鐘樓牌昂至二十四元四角、比前又升二角、惟下午市塲傳說、維大洋行等接電、謂大批坎澳粉於今日即可進口、首批裝載十餘萬包、繼批踵接而至、是以本客實銷、稍見减退、路貨求脫者漸衆、一是尚乏受主、惟高牌紅日當天粉、頗有木客垂靑、昨開三百餘包、價爲二十四元八角、華廠平賣粉仍爲二十三元、由兩廠批出六千餘包、市面前途、因到貨不絕、恐難過好、</p>
<p>小麥咋日市况、檳持如故、市塲交易、毫無做開、因天雨內地來貨告絕、日廠門市、亦無貨可收、限局暫不寬放、華廠方面、暫有新到洋麥接濟、出粉數量稍旺、故市面並無特殊開展、</p>
<h3>雜糧　投機猖獗　油餅起伏無常</h3>
<p>昨日油餅市况、在流言繁興之情勢下、起伏無常、一般乘風作浪者、更覺猖獗、豆油開即盤呈不穩局面、中途比上週末曾削元許、入後利多空氣濃厚、緊張之風、即　　揚溢、結果超出前市半元至一元、成交大連現油四百桶、價自一百十二元至一百十一元七角半、復昂砌至一百十三元五角、盯三月下交二百桶、價爲一百十三元七角半至十四元、四月上交五百桶、價自一百十四元七角半跌至一百十三元七角半、復跳至一百十五元七角半、花生油聽子油漲一元、簍油平平、豆餅現貨去路、由內地幫辦去元隆餅三車、肥字餅一車、期餅仍是投機一慣作風、一日間多空角逐、千變萬化、忽漲忽跌、神爲之亂、晨初先漲後跌、上午收盤近期比週六市稍砌三四分、遠期挫跌三分、午後開盤一反前情、上塲即買戶瀰漫、在頂峰時曾突起工角外、但結果被空頭蠭起壓迫、故收盤市即告軟化、做開甡記餅三月上交二萬片、價爲十四元二角半至三角、復爲一角八分、訂三月下交二萬餘片、價自十四元三角二分至一角八分、復砌至四角六分、再跌至四角、訂叫月上交三萬餘片、價自十四元四角至三角七分、復升至五角九、再跌至四角八云、</p>
<h3>紗花　獲利補空　棉紗起小反動</h3>
<p>狂落兩日之紗市、昨則稍有反動回升、同時香港幫採辦較爲活絡、不若前日之呆滯、所以驚慌之人心、已轉安定、二十支雙馬最高價爲一千二百八十四元、低價一千二百三十二元、午後始做一千二百六十四元、跌至一千二百六十元、量後爲一千二百三十元、今日有棉紗五十五件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開形勢仍虛、但較上日爲堅昂些、因其下降殊深、引起獲利者扒空、首盤價爲一千二百四十元、微跌至千二百三十二元、旋聞金價穩定而回上、盈利者復來補進、以致人心堅挺、市盤由低轉高、逐步漲至一千二百八十三元、詎料價格一昂、賣風稍起、一霎間忽落至一千二百五十五元、不過有一大戶將空額抵直、而翻小多頭、收盤父見回上至一千二百六十九元、查半日間成交統計八千八百五十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>棉市不振如故</h3>
<p>現棉情况、依然呆滯不振、此因紗市人心恍惚、上午初升午後大落、於此棉市更受影響矣、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、現貨商及南方幫皆有售出、故市况因賣氣濃厚而軟弱、結果收盤價格、較之上日續跌六七磅音、</p>
<p>印度棉市初起、即因太平洋局勢不靖而跌、旋雖一度因空頭抵補而回漲、最後又因多頭了結再跌、咋日連同預測低落一羅比半、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日紗市雖有轉機、且外滙更放長不已、情勢實有利於原棉交易、唯各方人心仍未復活、故市况平靜、並無趨動之意向也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　實銷不盛　售盤所漲甚微</h3>
<p>廠布昨市先漲　跌、趨勢軟弱、晨初以外滙報縮、布價反動上升、惟終以實銷不旺、後市微回、結果售盤較上週六略昂、細布每疋漲二角半至五角、斜紋漲五角至七角半、粗布漲五角左右、漂染布漲近一元、本街成交各布三百餘件、客幫略有動辦、惟數量均微、溫甬幫辦細布色布七八十件、閩幫辦漂染布叫五十件、香港幫辦斜紋色布一百餘件</p>
<p>東布因各路實銷擯持、欲漲乏力、現貨市塲晨開以紗價回升、散戶抵補、十二磅龍頭細布一度喊高至四十三元、但未幾同業逢高傾賣、重復下挫、上午收盤爲四十二元五角半、下午黃金續瀉、流言又熾、人心大虛、猛跌至四十元零三角半、收盤四君子嗶嘰一元一角三分牛、（取引所）期貨標布本月份收盤爲四十二元、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖續到</h3>
<p>自荷糖有中斷之觀察、上海糖商喜出望外、大漲特漲、不料連日仍有大量到滬、太古公司廣東蘇州兩輪、除裝來大批洋米外、另有大量車糖運來、計廣東輪裝八千六百五十包、蘇州輪亦裝來四千零五十包（祖（</p>

<p>逸聞</p>
<h3>懸賞捉拿英首相</h3>
<p>— 芝蕙</p>
<p>前年冬季，英國皇家空軍第一次飛臨德國天空，沒有拋擲一顆炸彈，僅僅散發了一些「紙彈——傳單——而歸。那時便引起希特勒部下的蝦兵蟹將們的椰揄和譏笑，認爲英國空軍自暴弱點，不足一擊；但另一方面，却叉嚴禁德國人民，拾取英國傳單，否將有被處極刑的危險。</p>
<p>不料去年希特勒對英展開空中閃電攻擊時，却也照抄了德人所揶揄過的英國老文章。原來他們也善用「紙彈戰爭。」英人接受了德方的「紙彈」，却很坦然；因恐大多數人民不深悉那「紙彈」的內容，倫敦的報紙並特地將它製版刊出，也算替希特勒盡了最大的義務宜傳。</p>
<p>那「紙彈」的正面是英首相邱吉爾的小像，手執輕　關槍一挺，外貌酷似美國偵探影片中的大盜。上面題着「懸賞」二字，下面是：「捕獲此戰爭搧動者。」這張照相上的英首相，照樣也口含雪茄，面現笑容。照相的背面是數行不很通順的英語：「照片中的這個流氓，他鼓勵你像他一樣去從事戰爭，而使所有婦女，兒童和一般無辜的人民都成了他的前驅者。一切戰爭早已由海牙和平會議予以禁止，這專制的挑動戰事的魔王，不將他軍法審判何待？快快挽救這一次戰爭的災禍罷，至少也得拯救你自己的家庭！」</p>
<p>邱吉爾自己看了這張「懸賞緝拿」的俾單，不禁回想到過去的另外一件事上：那是在三十八年以前，正當南非洲波爾戰爭之時，邱氏還是一位年靑的記者，他担任戰地通信的職務；有一回被敵人捕虜了拘禁起來，幾經曲折，他終於潛逃了。那時敵軍營內因爲脫逃了一個俘虜，於是在脫蘭斯瓦爾各處的通衢間，均可看見這樣的一張告示：</p>
<p>重賞通緝——死活不論！</p>
<p>美國人，年齡二十五歲，身材頎長，高約八英尺；體格上無甚顯著之特徵，惟行路時微現向前俯衝；膚色白晳，髮呈紅緩色，無鬚；發音時常帶鼻音，說S音時並不能十分淸晰。</p>
<p>邱氏一生這兩次著名的遭遇「涌緝」，如今在英國男女老幼口中已普遍地傳述着，成爲一樁極有趣的談話資料了。</p>

<h3>孩子的書聲</h3>
<p>— 珂霆</p>
<p>還是一年多前，我們剛搬到這裏的時候，早晚常聽到朗朗的書聲。這是一個十歲左右的孩子，就住在我們樓下。當我第一次踏淮他們的房間時，便發現了三個學校裏獎賞的鏡框，掛在灰暗的壁間，平添了許多光輝。</p>
<p>他的父親是一個綢廠裏的工人，日夜輪班地工作着。他和母親便要處理所有的家務和帶管一個小弟弟。有時早晨我還沒有起身，就已經聽到他讀書的聲音：有時半夜我從扶梯上走過，還可以窺見他在做練習，因爲他白天在家也不會有空的。</p>
<p>我和他的接近，已經是那一學期快放假的時候。他有幾題算術不會做，進來問我，帶着不好意思的樣子。我把做法告訴他，他都靜靜的聽着記住了。最後我問他F學期的事情，他却帶着不快說：</p>
<p>「爸說飯都吃不起啦，還讀甚麼書。」</p>
<p>「哦，』稍微頓了一下，我祇答覆個字，心裹却湧起了許多沒有說出口的話。望着他的眼眶裏，也湧現着淚水，我叫他快回家做題目，免得引起他的痛苦。他也很機警地低着頭走出去。</p>
<p>果然，第二學期他不能再進學校讀書了。我在每天晚上敎他一點國語和算術，他白天就到街上去販賣山芋和蠶豆，看看一學期父要結束了，我沒有和他父母談起下學期送他　學校的事。我知道即使是太多的同情也代替小了現實的缺憾</p>
<p>最近一個晚上，這孩子忽然在胸前捧了幾本敎科書進來，笑着　我說：</p>
<p>「明天，我　要進學校了，這是新書。」</p>
<p>我把新書翻一下，問他學費多少，他說：</p>
<p>「爸說，廠裹加了五分　一天，半年正好給我讀書，剩下的阿叔給我繳了。」孩子說時透露着愉快。他從袋裹倒出幾—顆燒熟的蠶豆，說是他當天賣剩的。明天起他不再大販賣東西了，道些送來給我吃，謝謝我牛年來敎他的書。</p>
<p>我一時尋不出話來對他說，望着一顆顆又扁又大的蠶豆，我祇有謝謝他。他好像高興我收了感情和厚禮，笑着叫我嘗嘗看，便一跳一蹤跑下樓去了。</p>
<p>這兩天來，早晚我又聽見孩子的書　了。在書　裏我得到歡喜，我知道他父母得到的是超過了歡喜的愉快與欣慰。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>湘綺看着母親一副愁雲密佈的臉龐，差不多已把她這次畢業考第一名的歡樂全掃空了。</p>
<p>「但也…也不能…怪…你…老子…。」母親眼淚汪汪的說：「他…每晚…給…人家抄…書…，時常抄…到…半夜裏才歇…歇手，近來眼…睛…已有毛病…了。」</p>
<p>一陣酸楚，突然擁上湘綺的心頭，使她也不由不傷感得飮泣起來。</p>
<p>她記得四年以前父親送她進女師的時節，穿的是一件已經　了兩年的夏布大褂；可是今天，當他應着侯校長的約上女師去的時候，她很淸楚地看見他身h披的還是這件舊大褂，黃得像蜜蠟樣，而且有幾處已經　碎了。他老人家幾年來生活的困苦，這一件大褂已經足够說明哥。哥在四年前不是很壯實的，雖然已被送進一家緞莊去充學徒；而現在呢？却已成了一個時時吐血的病人了！</p>
<p>「你老人家千萬休息一會吧！待父親回來，一定就有好消息了。」湘綺知道每天下午，母親總得睡一兩個鐘頭的午覺——這是她所能得到的唯一的滋補品——便竭力勸慰着，使她暫時忘掉一切的痛苦，慢慢地閉上眼睛睡去。</p>
<p>湘綺自己却還在坑沿上端坐着，一面替她母親驅走蚊蚋，一面深深地思索着。</p>
<p>她開始怪怨自己了！前幾天，候校長給她介紹的一家門館，她實在是不應該那末固執地拒絕的；假使接受了的話，現在至少可以使母親心上寬慰一些了！（三三）</p>

<h3>稀世難逢日全食</h3>
<p>— 枊</p>
<p>今年九月二十一日午刻日全食，（即陰曆八月初一日）迭誌本報。日全蝕，的確是難逢的機會，因爲日食常有，但日全食，近年雖有過數次，却都在國外。且全食時間多至五分鐘，少則一二分鐘，逾此所見又非全食。蓋以太陽星體之大，月體之微，地球旋轉之速，故一刹那即移過，並非各地都能見到。外人記日全食情景，煞是好看，所惜中國獨無此等記載。就史書中所記日食情形，以相推測，惟有兩起，相當於日全食。</p>
<p>（一）宋恭帝德祐元年六月庚子朔，日食旣，星見，雞鶩皆歸，即西曆一二七五年，此可決其爲全食。</p>
<p>（二）元世祖至元兀二十九年（西曆一二九二年）正月甲午朔，日有食之，有物漸侵入日中。不能旣，日體如金環然，左右有珥，上有抱氣。</p>
<p>此則似乎爲環食之類。據科學家推算，每一固定地點，隔二百年可以逢着一次日全蝕，然而全蝕之日，須天朗氣淸，纔能見到。而况在地面上所能見全食的影帶很狹，故同在中國，處影帶以外的人們，仍只見日蝕，不是全蝕。吾們只望勝利早臨，交通復原，也得赴中國全食地帶去賞鑑，寗非稀世難逢的快事。</p>

<h3>「春風回夢記」</h3>
<p>— 莫野</p>
<p>改編是含着再創造的意思，尤其是把小說改編成電影，更需要經過提煉和汲取的過程。不然，在觀衆，會弄得茫無頭緒；在導演，也祗能把一半以上的膠片，耗費在介紹上面，這會變成一團糟，「西廂記」便是例證之一。</p>
<p>有人慨嘆着上海的電影導演不懂「蒙太奇」，有流於連環圖畫化的傾向；無疑的，這是事實。「春風回夢記」總算避免了這些，可還沒高度的運用着電影手法，這也可以說是改編小說的最大困難。</p>
<p>劉雲若是鴛鴦蝴蝶派中的健將，這部以反抗舊禮敎，描述封建制度下靑年生活的作品，似乎是他的進步。可是沒有能把很好的題材，發展到反封建的主題。電影的最大缺點，也是如此。以小市民作爲對象的影片，由於他們智識的淺薄，不明晰的主題，往往會引起反效果，而且沒有主題，也就不成共爲藝術作品。</p>
<p>導演手法，相當簡潔。不過馮如蓮（童月娟）唱大鼓京音幾個鏡頭，太冗長而呆滯。最成功的地方，我以爲是：節奏的把握，氛圍氣的加强，與鏡頭角度設置的得宜。諸如：洞房花燭夜；中秋夜；立芳（李紅）病死這幾塲戲，都處理得非常得當，眞可謂緊緊地扣住着觀衆的心弦。所應負的罪責，那就是不能設法强調主題，突出主題。</p>
<p>演員也都稱職。尤以李紅，更有特殊的表演，意外的成績。自「西施」諸片以降，她有着飛躍的　步。　這裏，她表現了封建制度下舊女性的眞髓，不論是動作，內心的情緒，都使人感到眞切。</p>
<p>顧也魯（飾陸鏡寳）演來不差，還能傳達出智識階級的性格，可是在結末，他還不能　演出「既愛如連，又憐其妻」，充滿着內在矛盾的心理，明顯地表現出來。舞台上的習慣動作，倒已減了不少。</p>
<p>由於自己生活經騐的　富，童月娟已有了女伶的身份，不過有許多地方缺乏情感。</p>

<h3>記女彫房刻家　畢飛烈夫夫人</h3>
<p>俄籍女彫刻家畢飛烈夫夫人（Madame　Pertilie），從事彫刻，垂二十餘年，其作品精湛高尚，久蜚聲於海外藝壇。</p>
<p>初畢氏肄業於彼得斯堡最優學術研究會，投名彫刻師柴爾門與李錫夫門下，因能銳意求進，故盡得兩君所長，且有靑出於藍之美譽。一九二六年畢氏復遠游羅馬，以求深造，入羅馬美術研究會實習十年，名乃漸彰，曾於一九二八年在羅馬第九十四屆國立美術院展覽會中舉行展覽，一九二九年及一九三二年亦舉行展覽會，其他如個人展覽會，則不勝枚舉。畢氏尤專門鐫製半身銅肖像，如露絲普莉王子，聖敎王，紅衣主敎利比西亞，均曾由畢氏爲其鐫製肖像，甚有以獲得畢氏作品爲榮者。</p>
<p>畢氏寓居法租界貝當路三二一路公寓十七號，專攻我國美術，亦曾舉行個展，各界向其要求鐫製肖像者，頗形忙碌，並聞畢氏擬在滬設敎，以資閘揚，凡滬上靑年，愛好是項藝術者，誠難得之機會也。</p>
<h3>談談「販馬記」</h3>
<p>— 靜英</p>
<p>「販馬記」近一十年無名旦不唱的一齣熱戲，這齣戲好多人只曉得是崑曲，其實此戲不入崑曲，是一齣吹腔戲·崑曲與吹腔戲最容易分別的地方，凡是崑曲都沒有過門，有過門就屬於吹腔，所以這齣戲早年不入正班。</p>
<p>此戲據說早年朱蓮芬極負盛名；王桂官未改小生以前，也很不弱；朱幼芬陳德霖都曾唱過，但是中間有好幾年不行這齣販馬記，現在這齣戲能盛行於今日，倒是梅蘭芳之功。我曉得這戲有「種本子；一種爲蓋叫天自編，一種是貴俊卿在上海所演之本，一種就是普通的桂枝寫狀三拉團圓。蓋叫天是他一心一意的本子，他從李奇販馬起，李奇扮作關東馬販子束裝，有眞刀眞槍開打，說是李奇仗義疏財，廣結好友，某日路見不平，誤喪官家之子，官方捉拿聚急，李奇乃別友携妻　遁回故里，後生一女（桂枝）一子（保童），十餘年後妻病死，囚家中無人主中饋，乃娶前村寡婦楊氏爲妻，以下緊接貴俊卿所演本子：李奇故友約李　出關外販馬，李情不可却，別楊氏與子女而去，李去後楊比與地保田旺私通，爲保童看破，楊氏計逐保童桂枝，保童投江爲漁翁所救，收爲義子，桂枝尋弟不着，在樹林自盡，李有好友劉志全收賬經過，救桂枝復活，收爲義女，改姓劉氏，劉有同窗好友趙榮森携子趙寵來訪志全，劉見寵眉目淸秀，將桂枝許配趙寵，保童得義父之助，進京赴考，趙榮森病故，後妻逆待趙寵，寵以考期將臨，向劉叔父借貸盤費，李奇販馬歸來，趙寵在劉家成親，婚後即携桂枝赴京，李奇回家詢問子女，楊氏推說已死，李奇知其中有變，拷打丫嬛春花，春花左右爲難，懸標自盡，田旺與楊氏定計運動衙門，誣李奇逼死春花，李奇在公堂屈打認招，趙冲得中官封褒城縣，保童得中欽賜八府巡按，趙冲下鄉勸農，下面接普通本哭監，審犯，寫狀，告狀，闖轅，三拉團圓·我看過的以梅蘭芳程繼仙張春彥姜妙香蕭長　；程硯秋白雲生張春彥顧珏蓀曹．一庚，韓世昌白雲生魏慶林；朱傳茗葉盛蘭鄭傳鑑周傳瑛；新豓秋兪振　周信芳韓金奎五份爲最好，其中桂枝以程硯秋最滿意，次之梅蘭芳，朱傳茗韓世昌新　秋都還差些。趙寵程繼仙除了嗓子扮相，其餘都很好；白雲生靈活，魚振飛文雅，葉盛蘭小巧，姜妙香也擅長這趙寵一角，但是我所見的覺得他具儒氣以外沒有好處。李奇魏慶林神態嗓音都好；鄭傳鑑有神氣，沒有嗓子；周信芳張春彥也犯了鄭傳鑑一般毛病。李保童顧珏蓀很稱職。胡老爺韓金奎太火曹二庚有市儈氣，蕭長華尚好</p>

<h3>Great Naval Powers of Britain and the United States, Jointly Defending the Far Eastern Outpost: Britain Announces Minefield Boundaries off Singapore, Enhancing Naval and Air Bases to Block Japanese Southern Advance</h3>
<p>London – The British Admiralty announced that after laying mines in the sea off the eastern entrance of the Singapore Strait, ships wishing to pass through the area must request routes from the British naval authorities. The boundaries of the minefield are: north latitude 02°44' north, east longitude 04°30' east, south latitude 01°35' north, and west to the Malay coast. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London – Unofficial sources analyzed the Admiralty's statement yesterday, stating that the laying of mines in the southeastern region of the Malay Peninsula effectively blocks the main routes from Thailand, China, Vietnam, and Japan to Singapore. It is believed here that this measure further enhances the naval and air bases there. It is also believed that this action is an attempt to ease the tense situation this week caused by Japan's potential southern advance following Germany's spring offensive. The impregnable stronghold of Singapore has recently been reinforced by squadrons of Royal Air Force Blenheim bombers and Australian bombers. Observers believe that the arrival of the British Far East Commander-in-Chief, Brooke-Popham, in Australia also indicates further cooperation between the British Empire and Australia to defend Britain's Far Eastern outpost. It is recognized here that there is also an indirectly important point regarding the Far Eastern situation, namely that Japan is reportedly negotiating with Thailand and Vietnam to obtain air bases in those two places. However, public panic has been somewhat alleviated by the Anglo-Thai non-aggression treaty and the Thai government's announcement that "excellent relations" with Britain "have not been damaged." British commentators predict that if Japan takes any action against Singapore, Britain and the United States will inevitably cooperate to deal with it. The Sunday Times stated that the world's two largest naval powers, Britain and the United States, will stand on the same line to defend Malaya and resist Japanese aggression. The newspaper also stated that Japan may dream that the British navy is unable to look eastward and the American navy may not participate. If so, Japan will have its beautiful dream suddenly shattered one day. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Sydney – Australian Attorney-General and Minister for the Navy, Hughes, stated in a broadcast last night that although the situation is serious, he sees nothing that should cause the resolute Australian people to panic. Australians who heard the joint statement issued last week by the acting Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition felt uneasy and even somewhat apprehensive. In fact, this situation will pass. Foreign Minister Spender also delivered a speech stating that if we do not recognize the reality of the current situation, we will be deceived. There is a country that disregards traditional customs and past friendships. Even in terms of mutual relations and geographical connections, it should coexist harmoniously with us, but it has actually formed a military alliance with Australia's enemy. This is truly unfortunate. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Manila – Dr. Huang, a former senior official of the Chinese Ministry of Finance, declared today that the crisis in the Far East is linked to the situation in Europe. Regardless of what action Japan takes, the outcome will depend on the development of the European front. Dr. Huang arrived here from Hong Kong on the President Coolidge. He stated that Japan will not dare to participate in the Pacific war unless it feels it has a good chance of winning. Therefore, Japan is waiting for an opportunity to allow the European situation to become clear and definitely advantageous to the Axis powers. Dr. Huang stated that the situation in Hong Kong is very safe and it is prepared to deal with any unexpected events. Mines have been laid in the harbor to prevent unforeseen circumstances. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Japanese Actively Preparing to Advance Southward: Warships and Aircraft Concentrated on Hainan Island</p>
<p>Chongqing – This morning, all Chinese newspapers published news of Britain laying mines in the Singapore Strait and ordering the evacuation of British expatriates from Thailand in large characters. The Central Daily News reported that Japan is currently actively preparing to advance southward. The Japanese troops in Haiphong and Hanoi have been strengthened. Eleven warships from the Japanese Second Fleet have reportedly been transferred from Shanghai to Hainan Island. At the same time, the Japanese Second Fleet has reportedly also arrived at the island. At present, the number of Japanese warships concentrated near Hainan exceeds fifty, and more than two hundred aircraft have also been transferred from other parts of China to the island. The Saodangbao (Sweep Away Newspaper) stated that Japan has not yet completed preparations for actions in the South Pacific. Japan is concentrating ten divisions for use in actions in the South Pacific, but so far only a few divisions have been concentrated in various bases in the South China Sea. Moreover, Japan is still waiting for the completion of negotiations with Vietnam and Thailand to obtain bases, and believes that Japan is also awaiting the conclusion of German-French negotiations. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Daily News reported that the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly tense, and all countries concerned about the development of the Pacific are filled with anticipation. The eyes of the world are focused on Japan, wondering what its next move will be. According to the Japanese southern advance program, it did not begin today, but actually started on February 10, 1939, when Japanese troops occupied Hainan Island. Chiang Kai-shek called it "the September 18th Incident in the Pacific." Japan completed the construction of naval, land, and air forces on the island. At the same time, Japan is now in a position to control the South China Sea because of its agreement with Vietnam and its participation in the Vietnam-Thai disputes. We must solemnly declare that the stability of the Pacific situation is an essential factor for the United States and Britain. Therefore, we all believe that American aid to Britain should not be limited to the British Isles, but should pay the same attention to Singapore. Currently, the Japanese troops concentrated in the South Pacific are partly gathered in Hainan Island, Guangzhou, Zhou Island, the Xisha Islands, the Spratly Islands, and Vietnam. The troops stationed in Guangzhou are units of the 18th, 14th, and 38th Divisions. The troops stationed in Hainan Island are units of the Konoe Division, the 28th, and the 11th Divisions. The troops stationed in Hanoi and Haiphong include the Konoe Division and units of the 28th Division. The above troops are all under the command of the Japanese Southern China Army Headquarters, and part of them will be used to finally occupy Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay. Currently, there are four divisions of Japanese troops concentrated in Taiwan, two of which are newly formed, one division was transferred from Manchuria in October last year, and the 5th Division was transferred from Guangxi in November last year and was reorganized in early January. The divisions stationed in Taiwan are not commanded by the Southern China Army Headquarters, but directly obey the orders of the Tokyo General Staff Headquarters. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Thailand Denies Negotiating with Japan, Says It Will Remain Outside Disputes</p>
<p>Bangkok – Thai radio officials stated that foreign radio broadcasts that Thailand is currently negotiating with Japan to allow Japan to use Thai naval bases to attack Singapore are completely untrue. Japan has never mentioned this matter in talks with Thailand. The Thai government believes that regarding the tension in the Far East and rumors that Thailand will be dragged into the war, there has been no development that would involve Thailand in any possible conflict. It hopes that the general public will remain calm and not be disturbed, and will continue to perform their duties as usual. The Thai government, based on the country's construction program, strives to maintain safety and honor. The Thai government also assures the public that the government will make its best efforts to keep the country out of any international disputes. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London – As a precaution, the authorities have advised British women and children residing in Thailand to leave the country. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Bangkok – British expatriates here will hold a meeting at the British Embassy today to discuss the British Embassy's advice for British women and children to evacuate as soon as possible, and embassy staff will also explain the meaning of the notice. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>London – The Daily Telegraph's editorial today stated that the authorities' advice for British expatriates in Thailand to leave the country should be seen as a prudent precaution, not as clear evidence that danger is imminent. We should remember that when Hitler boasted of the total number of people under the Axis powers, representatives from the eastern and southern parts of the British Empire were gathering in Delhi. The representatives represented a population of 441.6 million people and an annual trade volume of 1.3 billion pounds sterling. Their undeveloped war power is truly formidable. Their geographical location allows them to distribute increasingly powerful forces to the most urgent places to protect the security of the Empire. Australia alone has the power to destroy the Nazi Japanese threat to the south, because Australia not only has soldiers of the best quality, but also has a good industry to back them up. Now the entire people are engaged in a great production plan. However, Australia is only one of the imperial arsenals that can supply munitions needed in the Pacific war. The article mentioned the industrial resources of India and South Africa, and also stated that the Japanese government may have a glimpse of the richness of this power. There should still be sufficient wisdom in the East Asian Conference to reject Hitler's theory of national suicide. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Ohashi Responds to Questions from Parliamentarians: Need to Seek Understanding Overseas</p>
<p>Tokyo – Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi, in response to a question from a parliamentarian in the House of Representatives Audit Committee today, confirmed that negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies in Batavia are about to reopen. He continued that there is a clear tendency for various countries to express unwarranted fear of Japan. This situation is caused by Britain spreading rumors that Japan intends to immediately begin its southern advance. He believes that the recent meeting between US Secretary of State Hull and the British, Australian, and Dutch envoys in Washington was prompted by this development. However, if there is any attempt to bind Japan by spreading such false news, we will have to reject it. At that time, the serious consequences may be difficult to avoid. Therefore, in the current extremely delicate international situation, it is necessary not only to seek understanding overseas, but also to find ways to prevent any unexpected developments at home. Although our interests in Hainan are a matter of life and death, the use of force will cause destruction and have adverse effects on Japan. The Japanese government's policy is to seek a solution through peaceful negotiations to the end. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Tokyo Japanese newspapers today published a large-character dispatch from Washington, describing the situation of the meeting between the Secretary of State and the British, American, Australian, and Dutch embassies last Saturday. However, most newspapers did not comment on the situation. After Hull met with the Dutch envoy to Washington, Loudon, he issued a public statement stating that the Dutch East Indies will "resist aggression." The Yomiuri Shimbun titled the Washington situation "Discussions on Joint Anti-Japanese Demonstration Focused on the Dutch East Indies Issue." (United Press, 17th)</p>
<h3>First Batch of US Army Families Leave the Philippines</h3>
<p>Manila – The first batch of sixty-seven family members of US military personnel returned to the United States today on the US military transport ship, USS Guayto. More family members of US military personnel will return to the United States on the transport ship USS Grant in the near future. Two more transport ships will arrive here to help the US military evacuate family members. Reliable sources say that six US transport ships have now set sail for the Philippines, carrying reserve officers and supplies. It is believed that the six ships will also be used to evacuate the family members of US military personnel here when they return to the United States. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<h3>US Lend-Lease Act to be Passed by the Senate: Office of Production Management Established, US to Become Arsenal of Democracy</h3>
<p>Washington – After returning from Britain last night, Hopkins, the Senate began its final debate on the Lend-Lease Act today. After President Roosevelt listened to Hopkins' direct report on the European situation, the bill began to enter its final stage. Hopkins stayed in Britain for a month and returned to say that Britain can certainly win if it can obtain sufficient assistance from the United States. He also spoke about whether his report would be published publicly in order to influence Congress. Supporters of the Lend-Lease Act began to act today in an attempt to obtain legislative passage, and have delegated Georgia Democratic Senator George, Kentucky Democratic Senator Barkley, and Vermont Republican Senator Austin. Opponents have also prepared to counterattack, and have summoned the best speakers to appear tomorrow. At the same time, Montana Democratic Senator Wheeler, who supports President Roosevelt supplying Britain with food and munitions, said that this move is intended to gain the support of farmers. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – The final stages of the Lend-Lease Act will begin in the Senate today. The opposition also knows that the passage of this bill cannot be avoided, but is still determined to reduce the various powers granted to the President. The government expects that the Senate can pass the bill within ten days. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – The highest new national defense agency has begun to exercise the power of making the United States the world's largest arsenal to defend democracy and free production management. The Office of Production Management has been established by executive order. President Roosevelt signed the appointment of the four members of the office on January 7: industrialist Knudsen, labor leader Hillman, Secretary of War Stimson, and Secretary of the Navy Knox. In the coming months, the three letters OPM (the abbreviation of Office of Production Management) will be as important as the early NRA (the abbreviation of National Recovery Administration) and familiar to the general public. The NRA was a method by which the President hoped to break the economic downturn, while the OPM wanted to accelerate military production so that Britain could defeat Germany. Since President Wilson appointed Baruch as the director of the Military Industries Bureau in the last war, the strict control of the national economy by the British federal government has not been greater than this time. In this crisis, it is the first time that the task of domestic rearmament has been entrusted to a small organization. The scope of the OPM's operations in accordance with the broad powers granted to the President can be seen from the statement issued by the four members. The following is part of the statement: "If we want to make the manufacture of American arms sufficient to defend democracy and freedom, then we must have the active, enthusiastic, and sincere cooperation of men and women, young and old, throughout the country. In this way, only the needs of national defense can outweigh everything else in the near future. For management, industry must place its business under the possible effects of immediate and massive expansion. Attempts at wartime profiteering must be strictly prohibited. For workers, the workers' loyalty and intelligent cooperation are essential. Workers must not improperly use their position in the current world crisis. Collective bargaining and workers' rights have been challenged. For management and workers, if the totalitarian countries of the world win, capital and labor will become the unfree appendages of the almighty nation." In fact, the responsibility for transforming the American peacetime economy into a wartime emergency economic system has been borne by one mastermind. The names of this mastermind are Knudsen and Hillman. Knudsen, formerly a senior executive of General Motors, immigrated to the United States from Denmark at the age of twenty and worked in a New York shipyard. He has been the chairman of the National Defense Advisory Commission since June last year. Hillman also came to the United States from Lithuania at the age of twenty and later became a leader in the cloth industry. He was very active. Before serving on the National Defense Advisory Commission, he served as the chairman of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The home countries of the two men are all victims of the current European war. Denmark has been protected by Germany, and Lithuania was annexed by the Soviet Union after the Soviet-Finnish War. Knudsen is now the President of the Office of Production Management, and Hillman is the Vice President. Stimson and Knox participate in the decision-making and inspection work of the Office of Production Management. Under the Office of Production Management, there are three subgroups. One is the Production Group, headed by Biggers, Knudsen's assistant on the National Defense Committee. The second is the Procurement Group, headed by Nelson, who is responsible for procurement on the National Defense Committee. The third is the Priority Group, headed by Stettinius, who is the director of raw materials for the National Defense Committee. The power granted to the President by Congress to promote national defense preparations has been transferred by the President to the Office of Production Management by executive order. This power includes the power to allow industries to prioritize obtaining tools and raw materials or goods, and the power to take over industries that oppose national defense construction. Priority orders will be determined by the Priority Group headed by Stettinius and signed by Knudsen and Hillman. Knudsen and Hillman are also ex officio members of the Priority Group. Other members are Nelson and Henderson. There is one more member who has not yet been announced, and it will probably be Biggers. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan and the Netherlands Decide to Reopen Economic Negotiations</h3>
<p>Batavia – According to official announcements, Japan and the Netherlands have negotiated and decided to reopen. The representatives of both sides will meet tomorrow to discuss the agenda. (Havas World News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Alleged Sino-British Military Secret Agreement</h3>
<p>On December 9th of last year, the Chinese National Government and the British Embassy in Chongqing issued official statements to firmly deny the news spread by the Japanese that the British Ambassador in Chongqing was negotiating a secret military agreement with the Chinese government. More than two months later, Tokyo once again spread the same news a few days ago. It was claimed that the military agreement being negotiated between China and Britain was an attempt to maintain British influence in the Far East and prevent Japan from advancing south. The content of the agreement would include the Chinese government forming a joint defense line with Singapore to counter Japan's southern advance, and increasing the supply of American military equipment to China via the Yunnan-Burma Road. As of the time the reporter chose this topic, the Chinese and British authorities had not been heard to deny this news; therefore, outsiders have no way to guess whether the news is credible or entirely fictitious. Regardless of whether the news is true or false, and regardless of whether the Chinese and British authorities deny, remain silent, acknowledge, or ignore this news, there are points worth commenting on.</p>
<p>In the past two or three months, there have been no concrete changes in the international situation sufficient to shock the world, but gradual evolution has been progressing daily. Looking back on the international atmosphere of early December last year, it can be said that the present is no longer what it used to be: the confrontation between Britain and Germany in the English Channel has been in a long-term stalemate, and Britain has become more stable, while the battle situation on both sides of the Mediterranean is deteriorating for Italy and it is almost unable to cope; China has broken the Japanese large-scale offensive in the Henan area; Japan's southern advance activities are engaged in blatant struggle layouts in military, political, diplomatic and economic aspects; the United States has successively elaborated on the inevitable actions of the United States through Secretary of State Hull and President Roosevelt, and the Mutual Aid Act has also broken through several difficulties and will enter the implementation stage; these situations are continuing to push forward, making people who pay close attention to the news not feel the gradual changes in the situation, just like people who meet every day neglect each other's gradual weight gain and loss. In this short period, what is especially worth synthesizing and highlighting is that Britain is openly strengthening its defenses from Burma, Malaya, Singapore to Australia; the Dutch East Indies is subtly declaring its refusal to join the so-called East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and is determined to resist aggression by force; the United States has expressed in various ways that it will not let go of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies at least; these points symbolize the completion of the anti-aggression defense line in the South Pacific. Two months ago, no one could make this affirmative statement without reservation.</p>
<p>Not only that, there are also things that can be written about in detail. According to the Reuters Tokyo dispatch, the remarks made by US President Roosevelt when Japanese Ambassador Nomura delivered his credentials, in addition to general responses, Roosevelt "reiterated the US intention to continue to aid Britain with all possible means except participating in the war, and strongly stated that the US deep concern for China has increased because of the belief that the war between China and Europe has become an integral part of the entire war," etc. Assuming that the transmission truly conveyed the essence of the conversation at the time, assuming that our interpretation is not mistaken, then Roosevelt, as the US authority and an international authority, now clearly points out that the two sets of wars in Europe and Asia are an integral part of the entire war, no different from saying that the two wars are one. Making this insinuation to Japan, the meaning is profound, and the possible connections and effects it may have are far-reaching. Now, there is no need to extravagantly state how they are connected and what the effects are, but the mutual pain and mutual dependence of China and Britain in the future has long been clearly understood in China, and Britain can also deeply understand this after regaining its confidence in resisting Germany. Now, President Roosevelt has revealed it from the sidelines.</p>
<p>Because of this, regarding the so-called Sino-British military secret agreement news, regardless of whether it has been signed in secret, or is indeed under negotiation, or the two countries have not yet discussed it, or have negotiated but have different opinions and have not reached an agreement, on the day a war breaks out in the South Pacific, the two countries will inevitably cooperate and help each other due to the urgent needs of the facts. This is almost a tacit understanding in the minds of people in both countries, even without a secret agreement. I once read a military essay by an American who pointed out that if a war breaks out in Burma, Malaya, and the area around Thailand and French Vietnam, it will definitely affect the overall situation. His argument is very correct: at that time, the Chinese army will undoubtedly be the decisive force among them!</p>

<p>Sihui - The Battle of Lubao, which began on the morning of the 10th and ended on the 13th, concluded with a major victory for the Chinese army. The battle unfolded as follows: The Japanese forces invading Lubao this time consisted of two regiments from the 38th Division and one regiment from the 囗囗 Division, totaling approximately 5,000 troops. They were supported by 12 mountain guns and two heavy cannons. Their invasion route was as follows: The main force of the 38th Division attacked along the Si-San Highway and the Lubao Highway. Another part of the force advanced to Xinjie, flanking out to Chini, Baini, and Guotaiwei, encircling Datang, with the aim of eliminating the Chinese forces, expanding the periphery of Guangzhou, and seizing resources from Lubao. The Chinese military authorities, having clearly assessed the Japanese situation, immediately ordered the defending troops to strengthen their defenses and arranged strategic measures. The Japanese cavalry, indeed, launched a large-scale invasion under the cover of six aircraft. The Chinese troops responded by holding their positions and engaging the enemy at Xianjueyuan, Dushugang, Shijiu Gang, and other locations. To lure the Japanese forces deeper, the troops were redeployed. Once the fierce fighting began, the Chinese forces initially engaged in long-range shooting, followed by bayonet fighting. The entire army fought resolutely and hard, annihilating over 1,000 Japanese troops. During the battle, for strategic reasons, the Chinese forces moved their troops from Lubao Town towards the northeast corner. The Japanese army fell into the trap, and a portion charged into the urban area of Lubao, where they were completely annihilated by the Chinese army, leaving corpses strewn all over the streets. At Chenshi (7-9 AM) on the 12th, Chinese reinforcements arrived at Shijiao (northeast of Lubao) from a certain location and launched a flanking attack on the Japanese troops entering Datang. The defending troops within the town also launched an inner-line pincer attack during the heavy rain and wind. Knowing they had fallen into a trap, the Japanese troops retreated in defeat from Yangmei in the southwest, passing through Leping Baiguan Kiln, and from Chini, Baini, and Xinjie in the north. The Chinese army achieved a great victory, sending out teams to pursue the enemy while entering the town to comfort the displaced people and handle the aftermath. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Romanian Government Lays Mines in Territorial Waters of the Black Sea; British Newspaper Predicts Germany Will Launch an Invasion of Bulgaria, Instructing Romania to Prevent Soviet Naval Activities</h3>
<p>Bucharest - Bucharest Radio Station yesterday warned merchant ships in the Black Sea that Romanian territorial waters fifteen miles north of Constanta have been mined. The Romanian government declared that ships entering the minefield without the permission of the Romanian Navy would be at risk. Diplomatic circles said that Romania's move, coupled with the rumored demands made by Germany to southern countries, has made the Balkan crisis increasingly acute. According to a report from the southern capital of Belgrade, Germany has granted the following three locations to the southern country: 1. The Trilin Valley in northern Albania and the town of Shkodër, which the southern country has long desired; 2. An outlet to the Aegean Sea through a corridor via Salonica; 3. Territory around the Ohrid River, including Koritsa and other cities occupied by Greek forces. According to the same source, the laying of mines in Romanian territorial waters was at the behest of Germany, to prevent the Soviet Navy from taking action in the area when German troops pass through Bulgaria to reach the Dardanelles. However, this view has not been confirmed. At the same time, diplomatic circles reported that large quantities of food are currently being concentrated in northern Bulgaria, hence the rumor that the entry of German troops into Bulgaria has been scheduled for February 25. (17th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - The London Daily Express predicted this morning that Germany would soon invade Bulgaria. After Bulgaria is completely occupied, Hitler will launch his full-scale "Six-Step" war against Britain. The so-called "Six-Step" war is said to be as follows: (1) Launch a full-scale submarine and air war against British merchant ship ports and transportation lines to prevent supplies from the United States from reaching Britain; (2) Launch a super aerial blitzkrieg against London and other central locations in Britain to overwhelm the British people and hinder the development of defense forces; (3) Repeated attempts at invasion, hoping for eventual success; (4) Launch an action in the Balkans to save Italy's precarious situation in Africa and enable the Axis powers to control the Mediterranean; (5) Japan suddenly enters the war, attacking British Malaya or the Dutch East Indies, cutting off Australia's supplies and dispersing British forces to the Far East; (6) Germany occupies Italy for self-defense, to prevent Italy's collapse and obtain a Mediterranean base for attacking Britain. (17th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - The general public in London today generally believed that the Germans would invade Bulgaria within a week or ten days. It is said that German tank columns or artillery units are moving towards the Romanian-Bulgarian border. It is also said that the 40,000 German troops previously concentrated in Constanta are now boarding ships, preparing to go to Varna, the nearest convenient Bulgarian seaport. British military figures believe that there are about twelve to fifteen German divisions that will cross the Danube River as soon as the weather is mild and the rivers are thawed. They also believe that Germany may even take this step, regardless of the fact that Yugoslavia has not yet agreed to German demands and is unconcerned about the development of the situation in the Balkans. It is reported that the Yugoslav government is studying the conditions put forward by Hitler to the southern country. It is believed here that the conditions put forward by Germany must be to demand that the southern country divide its territory into three parts for Hungary and five parts for Bulgaria in exchange for the land in Albanian north of Lake Ohrid, and to require Yugoslavia to sell all surplus grain to Germany. British figures here also believe that Yugoslavia has decided to resist a frontal attack, but Yugoslavia and Germany have reached some compromises on industrial and political cooperation.

Romanian dictator Antonescu seems to believe that Germany will win. At the same time, Bucharest Radio issued a warning that navigation near Constanta is dangerous in Romanian territorial waters. German troops have now infiltrated Bulgaria in plain clothes. It is generally accepted that the supplies stored in various locations in Bulgaria are for German use, which shows the Bulgarian government's connivance with Germany. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Spain and Portugal Suffer Unprecedented Storm Damage; Hundreds Dead and Injured; Ships and Aircraft Destroyed</h3>
<p>Madrid – An investigation recently announced that the violent hurricane that struck Spain and Portugal resulted in hundreds of deaths and injuries. A major fire broke out in a city, threatening to destroy it. Twenty ships sank, and dozens of smaller vessels were destroyed. Additionally, ten military aircraft were destroyed. Lisbon remained cut off from communication with most provincial centers this morning. It is widely believed that the losses suffered by Portugal are far greater than the fragmented news reaching Lisbon suggests. A Portuguese warship has also reportedly sunk, and the Sintra airfield has been destroyed, damaging ten Portuguese aircraft. According to news from Funchal, Madeira, banana plantations and sugar mills on Madeira have also been destroyed. In some areas of the island, up to 75 percent of cultivated land has been destroyed. Furthermore, in Santarém, over two hundred houses were burned down last night, the fire spreading rapidly due to the strong winds. A train was also destroyed last night, with twenty bodies found in the wreckage and one hundred and twenty people taken to hospitals. The horrific fire in Santarém occurred when a storm destroyed an oil tanker docked in the harbor. Due to the extraordinarily strong and relentless winds throughout the night, firefighters were unable to control the blaze. Some buildings in Santarém and several towns in northern Spain were damaged. All forms of transportation have been disrupted, and roads are blocked by fallen trees and debris. As the flames raged in Santarém, emergency reports were sent by radio to fire departments in Barbo, Victoria, Burgos, Valladolid, and other cities, seeking assistance. Firefighters and equipment were dispatched from cities as far away as Madrid. Soldiers stationed in Burgos were also ordered to assist. According to reports from Gibraltar and nearby La Línea, several small boats were blown ashore, and two seaplanes in the port of Gibraltar were destroyed. The hurricane originated in the Atlantic two days ago, then struck Portugal violently. After causing terrible destruction in Portugal, it wreaked havoc in northern Spain last night. The massive storm stretched from Madeira, 525 miles west of Lisbon, to the French border near the Bay of Biscay. The terrible winds blew an electric train off an elevated track near San Sebastian in Spain last night, resulting in over one hundred and fifty deaths and injuries. Then, early this morning, a major fire erupted in Santarém, threatening to destroy most of the city. It is reported that hundreds have died or been injured in Portugal, and communication with the northern provinces of Spain has been cut off. In the area near Zumaia in northern Spain, over one hundred and fifty people have died or been injured. In Alandroal, Portugal, the roof of a building collapsed due to the wind, killing twenty-seven people. When the hurricane struck, many residents had gathered on the roof to escape the flooding, resulting in the tragedy. Twelve bodies have been found at the site of the collapsed roof last night. Elsewhere, over one hundred people are reported missing. It is widely believed that over eighty people were endangered when the storm hit Ponte de Arga and Alandroal. A train derailment near Elvas, Portugal, also resulted in three deaths. Furthermore, the ship "Guayaba" ran aground in Patoca. The Spanish ships "Telaro," "Suliara," and "Roiadro" all sent distress signals from Cape Oroco. The report from the "Suliara" indicated that the ship had run aground near Cape Espichel.

<h3>Americans Urge the President to Supply Food to Britain; Britain and Germany Also Consider Plan to Aid Belgian Refugees</h3>
<p>New York – A national movement has been launched in the United States, requesting President Roosevelt to take all necessary measures to ensure the supply of food to the British people. Over a hundred prominent figures have signed a letter to the President, stating that the majority of the American people agree with the President's statement that the United States should be the arsenal of democracy. The letter continues, stating that the soldiers of democracy need more than just weapons; they also need food. Hitler boasts that the German submarines have sunk only the beginning of what will soon be sunk. Soldiers, no matter how brave, must be certain that the country they defend is not threatened by famine in order to achieve victory in land, sea, and air combat. The United States has the ability to prevent this threat from materializing. The letter also states that Germany steals food from the people in the occupied territories to feed the occupying forces. The only way to help the people in the occupied territories is to free them from the shackles of their aggressors. We Americans must know that their hope for liberation has not yet been extinguished, but if Britain falls due to famine, there is no hope for liberation. Therefore, the signatories urge the President to take the necessary steps to make the United States not only the arsenal of democracy but also the food supplier of democracy.

<p>New York – Willkie is currently considering visiting various regions of China not occupied by the Japanese army to assess the situation. If he goes, he will travel by plane across the Pacific. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – Republican leader Willkie stated yesterday that he is considering a visit to China, similar to his trip to Britain. When asked about the news of his planned trip to China, Willkie smiled and said, "No firm decision has been made yet." He continued, saying that he hopes to return to his law practice in the near future. Recalling Willkie's recent visit to Britain to assess the wartime situation and meet with British officials, he advocated to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the United States should do its utmost to help Britain, including "transferring five to thirty destroyers per month." While in London, Willkie told Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, that China is currently fighting on the front lines for democracy and that he hopes the United States will do its best to support this fight. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Political circles today are paying close attention to the news from the United States that Willkie will visit China soon. Willkie may come to China for an inspection tour, similar to his recent tour of Britain. Officials say that the Chinese government and people warmly welcome visits from important figures from friendly countries. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>New York – President Roosevelt's special envoy to Britain, Hopkins, arrived here yesterday from Lisbon aboard the "Yankee Clipper" aircraft. He told reporters that Britain urgently needs our help. He also said that while he believes they will receive this help, Britain does not need our manpower. British Prime Minister Churchill is a great naval leader. He also said that the British believe that Germany will soon begin an invasion, but the British are not discouraged because they are confident that they have the strength to resist the enemy. Hopkins is clearly convinced that Britain will ultimately be victorious. He said, "I do not believe Hitler can defeat the British, because the British are very brave." He added that the British have military intelligence and predicted that Britain would not be brought to a standstill by the war. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – Hopkins met with President Roosevelt at the White House last night and also had talks with Winant, the ambassador to Britain who is about to take office. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Reports That American Ships to the Far East All Carry Sealed Orders</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun published a report from Los Angeles that the captains of American ships traveling to the Far East all carry sealed orders that are not to be opened until the government issues a wireless telegram when the situation becomes dire. It is said that the responsible personnel of each shipping company calculate the exact position of each ship at sea every day, paying particular attention to American ships in the waters between China and Manila.

<h3>British Forces Advance on Two Routes, Encirclement of Keren Fortress; Italian Forces Cleared in Sudan; Polish Troops Join African Campaign</h3>
<p>London – British forces are advancing on two fronts to encircle Keren, the last fortress of the Italian army in Eritrea. The British forces advancing from the south are now only fifty miles from the city, and those attacking from the west are also gradually closing in. Belgian colonial troops are currently fighting alongside British forces in Sudan, and Polish troops have also participated in the African campaign. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Cairo – British General Headquarters announced today that British forces on the Eritrean front in East Africa were being reinforced last night in order to make a final attack on the Italian fortress of Keren. The communiqué stated that the fall of Keren is imminent. (International News Service dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Nairobi – A communiqué states that after the British army occupied Kismayu, the entire southwestern part of Italian Somaliland, up to the Juba River line, a total of 10,000 square miles of enemy territory, is now in the hands of the British army. The British navy assisted in the battle, shelling concentrated enemy forces in many coastal areas. In the north, South African troops continued to make progress, warmly welcomed by the local indigenous people, who complained about their suffering, such as their wives and children and food being taken away by the Italians. According to a communiqué from the British military headquarters in Cairo, the British side continued to dispatch troops to concentrate in the Keren area in Eritrea, which is progressing smoothly. A column of British troops on the northern route also continued to advance. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Cairo – After the British army captured the border outpost of Moya Gale at the end of the week in Abyssinia, the last Italian troops in Sudan were driven out. According to a Reuters correspondent from somewhere in Abyssinia, local news vendors, armed with arrows and rifles, are now distributing the first free newspapers published in Abyssinia in five years. The newspaper is called "Our Banner" and is printed in the forests of Gojjam Highlands. It is widely circulated. The printing press, etc., were transported by a British officer leading a camel caravan. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Cairo – The South African British Air Force has gained air superiority in Italian Somaliland and continues to relentlessly attack the retreating Italian army. The British aircraft that harassed the Italian army in the Chilimo Omo River area the day before yesterday strafed the Italian army's motor transport vehicles and ground aircraft yesterday. At the end of the week, British aircraft attacked the Italian army on the road between Gobwein (Italian Somaliland) and Chisimayu, and between Mocha and Bardera, with great success. The British forces fighting near Afmadu, Bardera, and Kismayu were greatly encouraged by the fierce attacks of the British aircraft. Yesterday, the Italian army's motor transport vehicle depot in Taysi, Abyssinia, was heavily bombed by British aircraft. The British Air Force in Eritrea also continued to attack enemy concentration points, motor transport troops, and other military targets. The aircraft hangar and workshop in Maya Daga were bombed, causing fire and explosions. Two British aircraft that attacked Rhodes, Albania, and Italian East Africa did not return.

<h3>Greek Forces Report Frequent Victories on the Front Lines; Many Italian Defense Positions Occupied</h3>
<p>London – A Reuters correspondent on the Albanian border reports that on Saturday night, the Greek army completely routed the Italian 11th Army on a 30-mile stretch of the Albanian front line from Moscopole to Tepelenë, capturing 2,000 prisoners and a large amount of war material. The Greek army's victory in this battle was greatly aided by the Greek air force. The Greek side claims that the Greek army has made further progress in the Prataisinochino Valley, penetrating deep into the Italian army's lines between Chrisoula and Tepelenë in the central part of the front. The Greek army is continuing to pursue the Italian army. Athens Radio announced last night that the Greek army's offensive in Albania is now proceeding according to the headquarters' plan. There are frequent victories, and the Greek army's offensive has achieved victories on all fronts, seizing more defensive positions. A defensive position occupied by the Greek army is particularly important, so the Italian army commander ordered a desperate counterattack to try to recapture it, but to no avail. The Italian army suffered heavy losses, and many officers were killed. The Greek army continued to advance deep into enemy territory. Some of the Italian Blackshirts who participated in this counterattack suffered four-fifths casualties. After the Greek army launched an offensive, the Italian army gradually fell into a desperate situation and tried to resist stubbornly. The Italian army in one area attempted to break through the Greek lines but was repelled by heavy Greek artillery fire. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Athens – A communiqué from the British military headquarters in Greece stated that British bombers attacked enemy positions in the Pozi area north of Chrisoula again on Saturday, despite unfavorable weather. The barracks, supply depots, artillery positions, and main roads in the area were also bombed by British aircraft. The enemy's motor vehicles and pack animal transport units were in chaos when they were bombed. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Crush German Invasion Attempt; Heavily Bombs German Bases; Italian Territory Also Attacked</h3>
<p>London – The British Air Force launched a major attack on German bases for the invasion of Britain. London believes that the German invasion plan has been crushed. According to sources here, the continuous attacks by Britain on the European coast have indeed disrupted the planned invasion of Britain. It is widely believed that the British Air Force is intensifying its bombing because it has received accurate intelligence about an imminent invasion. It is reported that military targets in the Netherlands, the Ruhr area, and coastal areas have been severely damaged. A Ministry of Aviation communiqué admitted that five British aircraft were lost in the recent air raid.</p>
<p>Rome – The Italian Supreme Command admitted this morning that the Italian air force bases of Brindisi, Catania, and Syracuse, used by the German air force, had been attacked by the British air force.</p>
<p>London – A Ministry of Aviation communiqué stated that British bombers heavily attacked oil depots and airfields in the western Ruhr area of Germany last night, dropping many bombs and causing fires in many places. The port of Rotterdam was also heavily bombed, with explosions in the dock area. Other British aircraft attacked the Polloye shipyard, causing a large fire. Two British aircraft are missing. British coastal aircraft also attacked docks and other places in Calais at night; three are missing. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London – Yesterday, German aircraft attacked various parts of Britain alone, including London. In the morning, British fighter planes shot down a German bomber off the south coast, which crashed into the sea. Bombs fell in several counties near three areas of London, and in some places in East London and Southeast London. Some houses in London were damaged, and other damage and casualties were minor.

<h3>Argentine Ambassador to Japan to Present Credentials the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The first Argentine Ambassador to Japan, Dr. Moreno, is scheduled to meet the Japanese Emperor on the 20th of this month to present his credentials. This is to implement the agreement between Argentina and Japan in the autumn to change the envoys of the two countries into ambassadors. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Germany Pays Attention to Building Small Vessels to Supplement Naval Strength</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German naval authorities have been paying attention to building small fleets to supplement the shortcomings of the navy in the past few months, especially submarines. Therefore, there have been fewer losses of enemy ships in the past few weeks. German long-range aircraft sank six British ships (29,500 tons) and severely damaged four ships (20,000 tons) in the Atlantic Ocean, 500 kilometers from the Portuguese coast. An 8,000-ton and a 10,000-ton merchant ship were sunk in the Suez Canal. Recently, two German submarines sank a 12,500-ton and a 20,000-ton ship respectively. The German fleet and aircraft jointly sank fourteen ships (82,000 tons). The sinking of the British military transport ship "Oxford" (the former German transport ship "Bitsch") (21,800 tons) in the central Atlantic and the bombing of the British supply port in Iceland are all the achievements of the German air force in operations outside the far sea. The appearance of German aircraft in the Mediterranean has caused British ships to disappear from the Mediterranean and reroute via the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Twenty British Warships Launched</h3>
<p>Washington – A local wireless station recently broadcast the news that in the past three months, the British Navy has had a total of two new battleships, two new aircraft carriers, five new cruisers, and eleven new destroyers, which have been incorporated into the fleet for service. At the same time, seven submarines have been lost. (Havas World Telegraph Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Tripartite Technical Committee is About to be Established; Matsuoka Announces in Parliament; Japanese Representatives to Berlin and Rome</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Foreign Minister Matsuoka announced today at the House of Representatives Budget Committee that according to Article 4 of the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact signed in Berlin on September 27 last year, a joint technical committee will be established soon. Japanese representatives have now been appointed to attend. In addition to the committee to be established in Tokyo, members of the joint military technical committee have already departed for Berlin and Rome, where the group will be established. However, he attaches the greatest importance to the joint economic and technical committee and peacetime industry, and pointed out that peacetime industry is the most important basis for national defense. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan Does Not Abandon Ambitions for Hegemony</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Foreign Minister Matsuoka said today in response to questions in Parliament about the refusal of the Netherlands, especially the Dutch East Indies, to be included in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, that Japan does not demand leadership over all the people in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but believes that the Japanese nation does have the ability to lead them. Matsuoka also said in response to other questions that no matter what happens, the Japanese nation will never abandon the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and that they have sufficient national resources to achieve this wish. Someone urged the government to negotiate with the Soviet Union regarding the Communist Party behind the war in the Far East. Matsuoka pointed out that the Communist Party and the Soviet government are not the same, but will take appropriate steps in case the Communist Party causes any disturbance.

<p>Tokyo – Foreign Minister Matsuoka reiterated today in Parliament that Japan insists on a policy of racial equality. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>English Translation:</h3>
<h3>War Diary of a British Officer on the Western Front</h3>
<p>It appears that the British army has decided to retreat. Significant losses of military equipment are unavoidable. The German army is constantly bombing various ports along the English Channel. Bombs are raining down on Dunkirk. If the British army is truly preparing to retreat, then the sooner the better. Today, the French plan is to arrange the retreat at the southern end of the Allied line in the north. I believe that this is the beginning of the end of the first phase. They may want to evacuate all thirty to thirty-five divisions of the Allied forces by sea to Gibraltar. In my opinion, this is impossible.</p>
<p>5:00 PM: Bad news has arrived from Belgium, the line from Zillebeke to Roeselare to Sinay has been breached.</p>
<p>What is most heartbreaking for us is the lack of fighting spirit. This is perhaps the result of the League of Nations' high-sounding pronouncements over the past twenty years. This is also a major reason for our failure. We do not shout the slogan of "nation first" like the enemy.</p>
<p>Hope is becoming increasingly dim.</p>
<p>May 28th, 8:30 AM: No significant news. An officer was left behind in Le Doucq. He got up in the morning and found that the German army had occupied the town. He told me an interesting escape story today. His wife is French, and he has lived in France for many years, so it was easy for him to disguise himself as a French fisherman. He stayed in the town for the first four days after the German army occupied it. The Germans are in Boulogne. The area of Le Touquet to Abbeville did not seem to be heavily defended. Only a few soldiers patrolled the city. There were also no tanks entering Abbeville. In various locations, only a small number of soldiers rode motorcycles, guarding intersections, with an occasional machine gun or two. He told me that the number of French people hiding in this area compared to the German army was five to one. The German soldiers were very polite. They issued passes to various business people, allowing them to move freely in and out.</p>
<p>This officer gathered several remaining British transportation personnel and returned in a small boat. He also told me that there were many French soldiers in uniform coming and going in the area, but of course, they had no weapons. They had thrown away their rifles. Someone heard a soldier say that if their officers had not fled and there was someone leading them, they could immediately surround and annihilate those German soldiers.</p>
<p>This war is simply too bizarre. There is a lack of conviction, indecisiveness, and especially a reluctance to be serious when facing events. This war in France will not last long.</p>
<p>9:30 AM: Extreme panic. News has arrived that King Leopold of Belgium has surrendered. The details are not yet known.</p>
<p>6:50 PM: Those who know the details are very sad to hear the news of the war on the radio. The radio is filled with politicians making impassioned speeches, talking about the heroic deeds of our army fighting in the north, but no one believes it anymore.</p>
<p>The current question is how many Allied troops in the north can be evacuated. Prime Minister Churchill says that perhaps he will be able to announce definite news at the end of this week. That means there are still four days.</p>
<p>I don't think we will be lingering here for long. The French army can only hold out for a maximum of twenty-one days. They are not fighting sincerely.</p>
<p>May 29th, 6:30 AM: Last night, Mr. Wu Dao'er from H school told me that after the French Seventh Army was defeated, it had completely collapsed. The Ninth Army can no longer fight either. The First Army no longer exists. Except for the ten divisions within the Maginot Line, the French army has only fifty-one divisions left. Ten divisions are stationed along the line from Abbeville to Paris. There are also thirty-five divisions distributed from Montmédy to the coast, a defensive line that is one hundred and eighty miles long.</p>
<p>It is said that the army is retreating smoothly under the cover of smoke screens. One troop transport ship has sunk.</p>
<p>May 30th, 10:00 AM: The news of the evacuation from Dunkirk is even more satisfactory than expected. Fifty-two thousand people have already been evacuated. If there are still low clouds and continuous rain along the English Channel, another twenty-one thousand people can be evacuated tonight.</p>
<p>According to reports from reconnaissance plane pilots, the French have made no preparations along the Aisne River. The bridges have not been blown up, there are very few troops, and there are no cannons or tanks. There are no trenches, and no one is seen digging. There are also no tank traps, and no equipment that deserves to be called obstacles.</p>
<p>This is completely contrary to the information from General Georges. He said that the defenses along the Aisne line were extremely solid. Wu Dao'er and Ao Si Bao Luo, who escaped and returned, confirmed our pilots' reports. On the road, they only encountered small groups of sentries huddled behind incomplete defenses. No machine gun positions were seen anywhere, nor were there any cannons aimed, nor were there any designated security zones. They visited the battalion headquarters near the Aisne and talked to the officer about this situation. The battalion commander was an unshaven, dirty, short man, not much like a soldier. When asked why there were no trenches, he said that the soldiers he led were African Algerian soldiers, and Algerians never dig trenches. This is truly unfortunate for the Algerians, but the misfortune suffered by the land they are supposed to defend is probably even greater. The situation of empty defenses on both flanks is not much different. There are no obstacles that can stop a German tank for even a second.</p>
<p>The German army on the opposite bank easily holds its position. If they want to cross over, they only need to cross the river at Soissons and Rethel. In fact, they only need to walk across as they normally would.</p>
<p>Wu Dao'er and Ao Si Bao Luo passed through Rethél. They said that Reims was like a dead city, neither bombed nor shelled; but there was not a single living person in the city.</p>
<p>The villages on both banks of the Aisne River are uninhabited. They asked the soldiers on the roadside why the villages were as empty as the cities. They pointed to the sky and shrugged their shoulders. From this, it can be seen that the terror generated by bombing is far greater than that of ten thousand cannons.</p>
<p>May 31st, 11:15 AM: The intensity of the fighting at Dunkirk is no less than that of the Battle of the Marne in 1914, but the situation is completely different. It is said that General Prioux's forces have broken through the German lines and have joined the British forces to serve as the rearguard for the troops evacuating from Dunkirk.</p>
<p>General Dill has arrived here today and is probably about to make a final decision. Should Britain risk sending reinforcements to support France in its current situation? This is what should be decided. In my personal opinion, it is not necessary. Our goal is to defeat Germany. Only Britain alone can achieve this goal. If Britain divides a not-very-sufficient force to support a defeated France, it will inevitably lead to mutual destruction. It is better for Britain to rebuild its remaining forces, and even if fighting alone, it will one day be able to achieve final victory and liberate France.</p>
<p>June 3rd, 4:15 PM: Probably around 1:30 PM, we were having snacks when we suddenly heard the terrifying sound of heavy bombers. There were three batches in total, about fifty planes in each batch, flying at an altitude of ten thousand feet. Not a single French fighter plane took off to intercept them. Only after the last batch had safely passed did one or two of the eighteen Morane planes rise to an altitude of three to four thousand feet, firing a few shots aimlessly.</p>
<p>It is said that Germany has nine thousand first-line aircraft at the start of the war. It can manufacture fifteen hundred aircraft per month. Our fighter planes suffered heavy losses in the initial three weeks. Bombers suffered no losses. Therefore, the total number of bombers is constantly increasing.</p>
<p>June 5th, 1:45 PM: Received news at 11:15 AM that the enemy had launched an offensive at 4:00 AM this morning along the line from Amiens to Péronne on the Somme River. At noon, the enemy's mechanized units had broken through at several points. At the same time, enemy forces west of Laon were also advancing towards Soissons along the Vasle River. The speed of the enemy's advance is truly surprising.</p>
<p>June 6th, 6:30 PM: The news from the northern battlefield is bad. The enemy forces are gathering east of Amien and north of Roye. There are probably eight hundred to one thousand tanks. It appears that they will attack Compiègne.</p>
<p>June 7th, 10:15 AM: The battle for Paris has fully begun. There is no reliable news this morning. The entire line is shaky. All kinds of changes are possible.</p>

<h3>Acting in Parallel with the United States: Britain Reiterates Evacuation Advice. Take Advantage of Current Shipping Convenience. British Authorities Issue Registration Forms to Survey Those Leaving or Staying.</h3>
<p>Since the US Consul General in Shanghai, on the 13th of this month, received instructions from the State Department in Washington to reiterate the evacuation advice, the situation in the Far East appears to have become more tense. However, all parties acknowledge that this move by the United States does not mean abandoning its interests in the Far East. Its purpose is undoubtedly to warn Japan and express firm opposition to Japan's southward advance. However, the Japanese side is conducting propaganda to stabilize public sentiment and alleviate the impact of the US actions in the Far East. Unexpectedly, the British Embassy also announced a reiteration of the evacuation advice the day before yesterday. According to an observer, there is no need to panic about the current state of the Far East. Britain's evacuation move is clearly a parallel action with the United States, confirming that Britain has likely taken joint steps with the United States to sanction Japan.</p>
<p>British Embassy Reiterates Advice</p>
<p>Reuter reported from Shanghai on the 17th that the British Embassy issued a statement last night for publication in newspapers, which stated that in October of last year, the British authorities had advised those who inquired that any British person who did not have a good reason to reside in the occupied areas of China should consider the advisability of leaving. This advice still applies. The decision to leave or stay, as well as the arrangements arising therefrom, must be made individually according to one's own circumstances. However, when making this decision, it must be understood that it will be almost impossible to obtain special travel conveniences in the short term, and that Far East shipping has been greatly reduced, with a limited supply of ship berths. Tickets must be purchased in advance, and this should also be noted.</p>
<p>Preparing to Voluntarily Evacuate</p>
<p>According to information from the British Embassy, after the evacuation order was issued last year, very few British citizens left Shanghai to join the military in various parts of Malaya, and the number of those who left China was far less than the number of American citizens who evacuated. This is because they were well aware that the international situation and the situation in the Far East would not deteriorate rapidly, and because of their wealth and all their investments, the number of evacuees was not large. However, after the authorities reiterated the previous order this time, all British citizens are likely to obey the order, make all necessary preparations, and voluntarily evacuate.</p>
<p>Issuing Registration Forms to Report Departure</p>
<p>The British authorities have already issued registration forms, requiring all British citizens to fill them out and submit them to the embassy, stating their reasons for leaving or not, and reporting for verification. Those who decide to leave can take Central American ships sailing in the Far East, or go to Canada, or return directly to their home country. Even cargo ships can be used to return to the country, taking advantage of other parts that can accommodate passengers. British consulates throughout the Far East should issue certificates to facilitate the evacuation of citizens. However, according to private information obtained by various British citizens, they are willing to comply with the order and assist in promoting government policies. Those citizens who remain in the occupied areas will later come to Shanghai to gather and wait for ships to evacuate.</p>
<p>British Community Organizations Assist in the Process</p>
<p>The British Association in Shanghai, the British Women's Association, the Great Britain Victory Association, and others believe that since the British government has repeatedly issued evacuation orders, it must be a matter of great national importance, and it is not permissible to allow the citizens to evacuate under disorganization. Therefore, they will convene meetings to quickly organize and assist the government in promoting evacuation work, assisting where there is insufficiency, and striving to see it happen in reality as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Coolidge Ship Tickets Selling Out</p>
<p>It is heard that tickets for the American ship President Coolidge are almost completely sold out. It is expected that a large number of American citizens in this city will take this ship on February 25 to evacuate and return to the United States. The tickets for various ships arriving in Shanghai in the coming months are also being heavily pre-purchased. However, according to an employee of the American President Lines here, the pre-sale of tickets is not as extremely crowded as it was at the end of last year.</p>
<h3>Notes on the Screening of German War Newsreels</h3>
<p>Mr. Ke Dejun, Information Commissioner of the German Embassy in China, invited representatives from Chinese and Western newspapers in this city yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM to view the latest European war newsreels that have recently arrived in Shanghai. The total number of topics is as many as forty or fifty sections, lasting four hours. Only half of it was shown yesterday to entertain guests, and the rest will be screened again in the same place next Monday. In terms of material, what was shown yesterday was not limited to combat and destruction. In addition to a part of the German aircraft bombing Britain, there were scenes of German leader Hitler meeting with several giants such as Pétain, Laval, Franco, and Mussolini, as well as German preparations for war, construction work, munitions manufacturing, and food supply. The activities of the German Air Force were much the same as those shown in the previous West Front war newsreel. Iron birds fluttered their wings, soaring into the sky. Upon reaching the target, they descended straight down, throwing bombs like discarding worn-out shoes, with eerie cries that moved people's hearts. In an instant, green smoke billowed from the ground, and in a blink of an eye, various buildings turned to ashes. What was shown on the screen was only half a minute, but the loss of life and property is truly unknown. Next was the German munitions factory manufacturing hydropower, leather boots, and distributing grain, treating the wounded, and employing prisoners in the occupied areas. The sound of gunfire and airplanes was replaced by the sound of machines, slightly relaxing the tense atmosphere. After a while, General Göring suddenly appeared on the screen, awarding the Iron Cross to soldiers who fought bravely in northern France, with a smiling face and a spirited demeanor, as if enjoying it endlessly. After screening for an hour and a half, a section was interspersed, which was an art exhibition held in Munich in 1940. It included sculptures of men with developed muscles and full of vitality, and statues of youthful girls with graceful figures and soft bones, completely uncovered, with a beauty that intoxicated people. In the midst of this chaos of war, it is also strange to have such leisure. At the end of the entire film, scenes of Hitler meeting with Pétain and Laval, meeting with Franco on the Spanish border, and gathering with Mussolini were shown in sequence. The explanation stated that "This kind of meeting surprised the whole world," which can be said to be a faithful report. Before this, there was another film of the street scenes of Paris. Because there were no cars in the city, residents had no choice but to use bicycles as transportation. A strange man with an unusual appearance stepped up to a basket-shaped trailer attached to the back of the car, which was very small and the man was gigantic. The person sitting in the car was not at all surprised, parading through the city. Those who saw this could not help but laugh or cry. "Paris like this" is also lamentable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Sailing to Haikou Are Still Allowed to Clear Customs</h3>
<p>The Zhemin (Zhejiang and Fujian) shipping lines have been blocked by the Japanese naval authorities, so the shipping lines of third-country nationalities have been greatly affected. Now, only Haikou is available for clearing customs, but navigation is quite difficult because ships are searched at sea, and if they are not careful, they will be detained. However, foreign ships are still trying to maintain operations in this difficult situation. Recently, it was rumored that Haikou was also notified by the Japanese customs commissioner to stop clearing customs. I inquired with the relevant parties yesterday, and they said that there was no such thing. Moreover, two ships cleared customs at Haikou yesterday, one Italian and one Weiler. As of last night, the ban on clearing customs at Haikou had not been implemented, and it is not expected to be implemented in the near future.</p>
<h3>Two American Banks Cancel Checking Accounts. Checking Deposits Transferred to Savings. Both Foreign Currency and Legal Tender Must Be Deposited and Withdrawn with a Passbook.</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 17th), it was learned from reliable sources that the checking accounts of Citibank and Chase Bank in Shanghai will be closed from March 1st and transferred to savings deposit accounts. The reason for taking this step is to prevent the possible expansion of the war in the Far East. The complete details of this new method could not be confirmed yesterday morning. It was only heard that the two major American banks will soon close checking deposits. It was also heard that the two banks will issue passbooks to current depositors, so that these depositors can continue to deposit and withdraw as usual. At the same time, the two banks will allow current depositors to issue checks, which can be directly cashed at the counters of the two banks within the scope of the savings deposits that have been transferred. When making deposits and withdrawals, all depositors must present their passbooks. This system will be implemented from March 1st. Depositors of the two banks will soon receive notices of this change in method. It was also heard yesterday morning that the deposits that the two American banks will close include both foreign currency and legal tender. According to an employee of an American bank yesterday morning, the only reason for taking this new method is prevention.</p>
<p>Launching Economic Warfare Against Japan</p>
<p>According to well-informed financial circles, the reason why the American banks in this city are changing checking accounts to current savings accounts and only allowing customers to withdraw directly from the American banks in this city and the New York headquarters is to deal with Japan. This is because the Japanese side has obtained a large amount of legal tender from customs and other agencies to exchange for US dollars and open accounts in the above-mentioned two banks, and they are unwilling to open accounts in New York. Although business people believe that this move by the American banks will cause some inconvenience, everyone believes that this matter will have little impact on the business of this city. It was impossible to find out yesterday whether other foreign banks will follow the example of the American banks and take the same measures. People in the American Express Bank said that they have not yet received instructions from the New York headquarters on this issue. If the banks follow the example of the American banks and take precautionary measures, then merchants will not be able to obtain US dollars. If so, then the method of accumulating legal tender and selling foreign exchange will completely fail. The Chinese business community expresses a special welcome to this move, because this move is very beneficial to legitimate Sino-American trade.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed Incident in the French Concession Last Night: Peng Bowei Was Sniped. Shot Twice at the Intersection of Rue Luber and Avenue du Lupan. Life in Danger.</h3>
<p>Peng Bowei, a native of Hunan, 54 years old, lives at No. 44, Le'anfang, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. He previously served as the captain of the Detective Team of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters and a standing member of the Seamen's Union. He is currently the chairman of a certain "Seamen's Union". Yesterday at 6:15 PM, Peng Bowei was walking near the intersection of Rue Luber and Avenue du Lupan in the French Concession when suddenly three or four people flashed out from the roadside and fired two shots at Peng Bowei. Peng was hit by one bullet each in his left waist and left thigh, was wounded and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The shooters, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled towards Route Tenant de Villeviers.

They quickly called an ambulance and sent Peng to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is said that the injuries are serious, and his life may be in danger. At the time, Peng was wearing a gray mink fur coat, covered with a Maconi overcoat, a felt hat, and cotton shoes.

<p>It is heard that the Dutch authorities have revoked the order for Dutch ships to stop at the Shanghai port and various ports in Japan in the Far East.

<h3>Impersonating the Three People's Principles Youth League to Intimidate and Extort</h3>
<p>Recently, a type of letter bearing the name of the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League has been discovered on the market, attempting to intimidate and extort from all walks of life in the name of charitable relief work. However, this designation is merely intended to impersonate the name of the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League, which is believed by ordinary patriotic youth, in order to achieve its cunning trick of confusing the public. In addition to the fact that the relevant parties have thoroughly investigated it, people from all walks of life are well aware that this behavior is a habitual trick of unscrupulous elements to swindle and deceive, and they all ignore it, warning each other not to be deceived.</p>

<h3>Rampant Civilian Draft in Hongkou; Residents Afraid to Leave Their Homes; Over 1,000 People Conscripted in Three Days and Sent to Various Battlefields for Hard Labor</h3>
<p>Japanese troops in the Hongkou area suddenly began conscripting civilians on the evening of the 15th (Sunday). By yesterday, over one thousand residents had been conscripted. As a result, Chinese residents in the Hongkou area have been staying indoors, and residents of the concession area are unwilling to venture into this unjust place. The following is according to a gentleman who was conscripted and escaped, speaking to a Dagong News reporter:</p>
<p>Most of Those Conscripted are Laborers</p>
<p>I (the conscripted person speaking) went out to visit a friend at 9:00 PM on the 15th. While walking near the end of Yangshupu Road, I was suddenly seized by three Japanese military police and dragged to the sixth floor of the Japanese military headquarters at the end of North Sichuan Road. There were already over 500 conscripted civilians there, all of whom were laborers. The weather was extremely cold that day, and several people had not yet had dinner, so they were in dire straits due to hunger and cold. However, when they asked the translator (employed by the Japanese) to go out and buy food, they were refused. The translator also told me, "You must not show any signs of hunger or cold in front of the Japanese, otherwise you will be beaten severely." Later, I asked where we were being taken, and they replied,</p>
<p>Sent to the Front Lines for Labor</p>
<p>"You will mostly be sent to various battlefields to serve as laborers, or to the first line of defense." Upon hearing this, I was extremely frightened. Around 10:00 PM, I saw a unit of over ten Japanese soldiers, holding bayonets, enter and drag away over 200 people. My departure time was at midnight. Shortly after midnight, I saw a unit of Japanese soldiers enter and force us to go downstairs and board trucks. When we reached the vicinity of the Wenzaobang, I decided to seize the opportunity to escape, because I thought that even if I went, there would be no chance of survival, so it was better to escape from death. Therefore, when the truck stopped briefly, I jumped out of the truck and into the river. As soon as I swam to the other side, I heard a gunshot, but I had already taken refuge in a broken cave. Soon after, I heard the sound of the army moving away and then silence. I returned home at 3:00 AM the next morning, but my family had already been greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>Six Barber Shops Reopened Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Employees of six barber shops in the French Concession, including Huaxin, Paris, Yuegong Xiahfei, Baimei Gui, and Baimei Gui branch on Foch Road, resumed work yesterday morning, after having been on strike since the morning of the 9th of this month, demanding that management improve profit sharing. According to a Dagong News reporter, the management agreed to resolve the issues after the employees resumed work. All employees of the barber shops have returned to work since yesterday morning. The issue of profit sharing is still under negotiation between labor and management, and it is expected to be fully resolved next week.</p>
<p>Suspension of Navigation of the Yinxi Small Steamboat</p>
<p>According to communication from transportation circles, travelers from Shanghai to Ningbo used to take a steamboat to Xikou, then transfer to a Jinxi intermodal vehicle. It is now learned that the Yinzhou Creek small steamboat, which runs on the Yong River between Ningbo and the Yinjiang Bridge, has been approved to suspend its operations from today. Due to the high price of diesel fuel, making revenues insufficient, and the difficulties in allocating fuel, as well as sluggish business, the service has become unsustainable. Passengers traveling to and from will have to take ships from now on.</p>

<h3>Donations for the New Pu Yu Hall; Enthusiastic Support from All Sectors; A Great Manifestation of Social Compassion</h3>
<p>The New Pu Yu Hall in the Nanshi (Southern City) area has been established for over thirty years and is a charitable organization that manages the relief of orphaned boys and girls, as well as the elderly, weak, and disabled, in a most comprehensive manner. Over the years, it has benefited over ten thousand people, especially in the nurturing and education of children, which has been highly praised by people from all walks of life. Its expenses are entirely derived from donations from kind-hearted women and men from all walks of life, enabling it to be maintained year-round. However, since the passing of Mr. Lu Bohong, who was the most ardent supporter, donations have inevitably decreased. Coupled with the rising prices of everything in recent years, it has become even more difficult to maintain. Now, kind-hearted people from all walks of life, having learned that the hall's finances are exhausted, have been actively donating one after another. Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from the host of a dinner party of ten people, under the pseudonym "Idiot," who, in addition to raising a large amount of cloth, also donated 200 yuan from the dinner expenses. In addition, various companies, pharmacies, and Mr. Wu Zhiqing have also made donations, demonstrating the keenness of all sectors to care about relief efforts. It is deeply hoped that all parties can continue to generously donate funds and goods to expand relief efforts, which would not only be fortunate for hundreds of orphans, but also a blessing for society.</p>
<p>Saving on Dinner Expenses to Engage in Assistance</p>
<p>The host of the ten-person dinner party wrote to this newspaper yesterday, stating, "We, having learned that the more than 900 orphans in the New Pu Yu Hall in Nanshi are crying out for food and are in dire straits, which is very pitiful, in addition to raising over 800 yards of twill cloth from Mr. Wang Tongyuan of the Dawei Printing, Dyeing, and Weaving Factory to provide clothing, we have also transferred 200 yuan of our dinner expenses to assist the hall. Although the amount is small, it is only a token of our concern for others. The surnames of the ten members of the meeting are not to be disclosed. Please forgive us. The donated cloth and money have been delivered to Mama Margarita." Sincerely, The host of the ten-person dinner party, "Idiot," February 17, Year 30.</p>
<p>Compassion from All Sectors; Enthusiastic Donations</p>
<p>The New Pu Yu Hall has received many donations of money and goods in recent days. A summary is as follows: Wu Zhiqing: 500 yuan; Wang Maoting: 50 yuan; Rongfeng Textile Company: 100 yuan; Mrs. Lu: 1,000 yuan; Wuzhou Pharmacy: monthly donation of 100 yuan; Lü Guicong: monthly donation of 50 yuan; Huamei Pharmacy: 100 yuan worth of medicine; Guangzhong Towel Factory: ten dozen towels; Daxin Company: one gas stove; Ms. Tan Hongpu: 100 sets of children's cotton-padded jackets and trousers, plus 43 other items; Tongyu Salt Industry Company: ten market dan (a unit of weight) of table salt; Houde Hao: ten bags of broken rice; Yuanyuan Milk Company: two pounds of milk daily; Sullivan Company: ten pounds of biscuits monthly; Taikang Company: fifteen pounds.</p>
<h3>Manager of Dayouyu Oil Factory Robbed in Broad Daylight; Loss of 4,900 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Dayouyu Machine Oil Pressing Factory, located at No. 26, Che Dai Jiao, West Suzhou Road, in the Hongkou area, has been established for many years and is thriving. It also has a distribution department at No. 27, Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road. The general manager is Zhang Lunqing from Liuhe. Around 9:05 AM yesterday morning, Zhang went to the factory to work as usual, placing 4,900 yuan in oil payments from the retail department in his pocket, intending to take it to the distribution department on Beijing Road. At the Yunfei Automobile Branch Station at No. 9, Baike Road, he rented a No. 12244 car driven by a local driver named Lin Gen. When the car arrived in front of the factory gate, Zhang was already waiting at the entrance, ready to get into the car. Unexpectedly, three bandits ambushed nearby. One pointed a box cannon, and two held handguns, intercepting Zhang, pointing the weapons at his chest, and forbidding him to speak. They robbed him of all 4,900 yuan in oil payments from his pocket and fled on bicycles. Afterwards, Zhang reported the incident to the responsible police station based on information received, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Raided in Yangtze Hotel</h3>
<p>Detectives Gao Yong'an and Zhou Wenqing from the Old Gate Police Station learned that there was a gambling operation taking place in Room 320 of the Yangtze Hotel, located at No. 287 Yunnan Road, where profits were made by taking a cut. They rushed to the scene at 11:00 PM the night before and arrested the owner and gamblers Chuan Guoliang, Gu Zhaoxing, Zhou Jiasheng, Ma Shiliang, Wu Dekun, and a total of thirty-five people. They seized a large number of gambling paraphernalia, including playing cards, dice, shakers, ledgers, and chips, as well as 493 yuan in cash. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where the police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, legally prosecuted them. After questioning by Judge Yan, they were punished accordingly.</p>
<h3>Widow Commits Suicide by Slitting Throat Over Neighbor's Stolen Overcoat; Death From Severed Throat; Only Son Left an Orphan</h3>
<p>Dai Wu, a 30-year-old widow from Jiangxi, residing on the third floor of No. 4, Aido Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, passed away three years ago. Wu raised a single son, Ri Hua (16 years old this year), born to her husband's previous wife, by working as a seamstress. Her son is currently studying in elementary school. Chen Jiafu, a Ningbo native, lived with her. On the 8th of this month, an overcoat valued at over one hundred yuan was stolen. At that time, there was no way to investigate, so it was not made public. On the afternoon of the 15th, Chen's eleven-year-old daughter, Gui Di, went to Wu's room to play and found a piece of cloth with Chen Jiafu's name written on it, which was from the missing overcoat, in Wu's room. She reported it to Chen Jiafu, who obtained this subtle evidence. The next day, Chen reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate and took Dai Wu into custody. Wu, fearing pain and suffering at the time, admitted to the theft against her will. She asked someone to invite Zhang Guozhen, a Henan native who was a friend of her husband and worked as an investigator at the Dafang Hotel, to the police station, begging Zhang to vouch for her, willing to go outside and return the overcoat. The police chief then ordered the original detective to take Chen Jiafu and Dai Wu home together to retrieve the overcoat. However, on the way, Wu thought to herself that she had absolutely not stolen the overcoat and was being falsely accused of being a thief. Not only was her reputation ruined, but she could not face anyone, and when she got home, she had no way to hand over the original item. In desperation, she had a moment of rashness. Upon arriving home, she falsely told the accompanying detectives that she needed to use the restroom, then entered the room to relieve herself. The detectives waited patiently outside the door for a moment, waiting for her to finish before taking back the overcoat. The detectives deeply believed her, but as soon as Wu entered the room, she used a sharp pair of scissors to stab her throat, penetrating an inch deep, and fell to the ground wounded. Only then did the detectives hear the sound and enter the room, discovering Wu's suicide. They quickly snatched the scissors and called the neighbors to help lift her downstairs and send her to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the detective took the murder weapon, the sharp scissors, back to the police chief to report. Because her throat had been severed and the injury was in a vital spot, there was no way to save her. She died at 6:00 PM that afternoon. The police sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall. Yesterday, the deceased's son, Dai Rihua, took the body along with relatives to negotiate with Chen Jiafu, who had lost the overcoat. As a result, Chen paid for a simple burial. Chen Jiafu caused a life to be lost due to the lost coat. The loss of both the coat and the money is a small matter, but the deceased's son has become an orphan without parents, creating problems with his life and education. It is a truly unfortunate disaster. The elders of Dai Rihua are devising a way to maintain his life and education.</p>
<h3>Boiler Explosion at Huade Light Bulb Factory; Six Pedestrians Injured</h3>
<p>The Huade Light Bulb Factory, a Chinese-owned factory located at No. 291 Tokyo Road in the Public Concession, is a large-scale operation employing over a hundred workers. It starts manufacturing light bulbs at 8:00 AM every day. The boiler for the factory's own source of fire used in the manufacture of light bulbs is installed in the factory's courtyard. Because the boiler's temperature is extremely high, while workers were working near the boiler around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the boiler suddenly exploded due to excessive heat, with a sound that shook the neighborhood. Because the force of the explosion was very strong, the glass windows of the buildings near the courtyard and the adjacent bungalows were shattered. Glass shards flew and fell on the road outside the factory. At that time, six pedestrians were injured in the head and face. They were: (1) Shi Chen (37 years old, injured hands and head), (2) Yin Xiaodi (8 years old, injured right hand), (3) Shen Diao (29 years old, injured hand), (4) Shao Xiaodi (37 years old, injured head and face), (5) Yin Wang (48 years old, injured face), (6) Gao Youquan (37 years old, injured hands and face). However, none of the workers near the boiler were injured. The nearby police officers immediately summoned an ambulance and sent the injured to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were minor, and they were discharged after bandaging.</p>
<h3>Robberies Recorded</h3>

<h3>Diagnosis and Treatment at the People's Women and Children's Hospital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai People's Women and Children's Hospital, located at No. 995 Connaught Road in the city, is committed to safeguarding the health of the common people. Since its opening, medical treatment and medicines have been provided free of charge to common people. In June of last year, the hospital moved from Weihaiwei Road to No. 995 Kangnao Road. Because it is close to the factory area, with a large number of working-class residents, the number of people seeking treatment has increased significantly. The number of people seeking hospitalization for childbirth has also increased, and the hospital is barely able to cope. Last month, there were 122 inpatients for childbirth, a total of 313 inpatients, and 509 outpatients. Outpatient hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily (except Sundays and holidays). On Tuesday afternoons, a postpartum health checkup is added to specially examine and treat women who have been a month postpartum, enabling them to reach a healthy stage sooner.</p>

<h3>Host Entertains Guests at a Brothel; Car Robbed and Person Kidnapped; Car Found on Haifang Road 15 Minutes Later; Police Investigating Identity of the Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Zhu Nianci, the manager of the Xiexin Paper Store located in Shandong Road in the Public Concession, rode his own car, No. 2330, to entertain guests at the Shuangmei brothel located at Xizhi Lane in Guangxi Road. His car was parked in front of the Yuehua brothel in Guangxi Road. The driver was sleeping in the car. At 11:15 PM, suddenly a gangster came and threatened the driver with a gun, drove him out of the car, and did not allow him to speak. Shortly after, two more gangsters escorted a middle-aged man into the car. The two people holding the guns also successively entered the car, accelerated at full speed, and drove rapidly west. The driver saw that the car was far away and went to Shuangmei's house to report to the host and transferred the report to the police, requesting investigation. Later, at 11:30 PM, the car was found at the intersection of Haifang Road and Gordon Road in the Western District. The police notified Zhu Nianci to send someone to the police station to receive the car. The identity of the kidnapped middle-aged man could not be determined for a while.

The U.S. dollar speculators in the month offered a favorable price of 5.625 yuan, and the spot U.S. dollar soon reported an opening of 5.6875 yuan. At that time, the negative air was strong again, such as the current deposits of American banks in this city will be changed to savings in order to be frozen, and the British evacuated overseas Chinese in Siam to show that the situation in the East was urgent. People's hearts were unstable, and the HSBC quotations did not change. After that, some speculators suddenly started to recover, and they heard that they were re-doing the multi-head move, and the vision was shortened from long to short. It is calculated that the Huaxing Dongya and foreign banks have dug the U.S. dollar price of February to 5.625 yuan. Until noon, the potential was slightly reduced. The U.S. dollar in the month of May, 625, has been difficult to conclude. The noon harvest spot U.S. dollar is 5.625 yuan, and the first order is 3/53125.</p>
<p>The Market Was Selling Again Later</p>

<h3>U.S. Dollar Freeze Widely Rumored in the Market; Gold Market Volatile and Violent; Difference between Spot and Futures Prices Nearly 300 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash (raw gold) black market rose and fell suddenly, and the changes were amazing. The noon market was strong. The opening price was 6,200 yuan, and it reached 6,250 yuan. This was because the foreign exchange softened and rebounded. Xiangxingyong, Hengji, and Chida all came in. Although there was still selling pressure in the middle, the noon closing was still 6,205 yuan. After the market, the exchange market was widely rumored that the United States would soon implement a freeze on funds, and the U.S. dollar increased again. It was due to the sharp selling pressure, falling to a low price of 6,040 yuan. Although Tiancheng Hengji and others came in, the rebound was only 30 yuan, and it was reported to be 6,070 yuan. The evening closing was 6,060 yuan, which was 75 yuan lower than the closing price on the weekend. The after-hours market once did 6,045 yuan, and the spot price was more than 270 yuan higher than the futures price. The total daily futures trading volume was about 10,000 taels. The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael in the silver building finally stabilized. The customs gold and other items were also flat.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Continued to Fall 75 Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, people's hearts were slightly firm, and there were many buyers, so the opening price was 6,200 yuan under the fierce increase of Xiangxingyong and others, which was 65 yuan higher than the doing on Saturday. Under the looting of Hengji and other silver firms, the price continued to rise soon, rising to 6,250 yuan. In the end, the foreign exchange was strong, and the exchange market still had rumors that the United States was freezing funds. It was also heard that the American banks in this city would change foreign currency current deposits to savings to facilitate freezing, and the selling pressure started again. It is estimated that the big Ditongkang Yongshun Yuan and others exerted themselves, and the price fell in stages amidst the excess supply and insufficient demand, and soon entered the 200 yuan pass, reporting 6,155 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange suddenly had a puller, the price rebounded slightly, which inspired Chida, Tongyongtai Xiangxingyong and others to come to buy, and was pulled out of the 6,200 yuan pass, rising to 6,240 yuan. Unexpectedly, the exchange merchants still had a tight-fisted mentality when they saw the high price, in order to maintain the lack of supply, and remained as low as 6,180 yuan. The noon closing was 6,205 yuan. The afternoon opening was still expensive, at 6,225 yuan. The price was good five yuan in an instant, and it reached 6,230 yuan. Afterwards, due to the negative news from the exchange market, people's hearts were greatly affected, such as Dafeng, Renchengyong, and Xinfengyong, all of whom frantically threw, and quickly crossed the 200 yuan pass, falling directly to 6,040 yuan. Although Tiancheng Hengji and others bought in after this, they only rebounded to 6,070 yuan, and the evening closing was only 6,060 yuan, which was 75 yuan lower than the weekend closing. The spot price was more than 210 yuan higher than the futures price in the morning, and it was heard that it had risen to 275 yuan in the afternoon. There were not many transactions.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Show Mixed Gains and Losses; Foreign Stocks Have Risen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the black market for government bonds was still in the struggle between bulls and bears. The high and low still fluctuated by one yuan and several jiao. The two sides are making a final struggle. Who will die is still uncertain. However, there were sudden rumors in the afternoon that foreign exchange had risen sharply and gold had fallen sharply. People's hearts were also weak, and the situation was not good. Therefore, the good prospects in the future are ultimately limited. However, it is also said that now that the floating capital is concentrated in Shanghai, the silver root is loose and excessive, and the interest rate is only 70%. Banks have reduced interest rates one after another, 2 or 3% for current deposits, and foreign banks have no interest. Government bonds are equal to cash and are not as convenient as bank current deposits. The chances of winning the lottery for Type E unified bonds range from 12 to 36 for Type A, twice a year, and the face value right per hundred yuan is about four yuan and eight jiao, plus interest of six yuan, a total of ten yuan and eight jiao. Calculated at an average market price of 65 yuan, the interest rate is weakly 1.7%, which is different from the safety of the cotton yarn and gold trade that fall by hundreds of yuan at a time. Therefore, it is believed that if there is a war in the Pacific, the future of Chinese government bonds will be even brighter, so it is said that the bond market will not end up in decline. Yesterday's transactions: Xinfu bought in more in the morning, followed by Renchang and Renfeng, while Hongda was the most seller, followed by Xie Kangrun Lianyi Hengkang. Therefore, the market price closed as high as 64 yuan and one jiao, and only 62 yuan and eight jiao. Xinfu continued to buy in the afternoon and still had surplus courage. Hengkang Xinhua Changji Lianyi followed. However, Hongda still had a large number of long positions coming out, and others such as Xiechang Xinchang Yitai Tongkang Runli Tongxing all sold. The market price rebounded several jiao, and the result of the competition was a continuous rise of two jiao to five jiao, but Type B bond rebounded two jiao. The total number of transactions was about 2.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 25 Guanshengyuan shares were traded at a price of 70 yuan.</p>
<p>The public stock market opened with a good spirit, and the prices rose a lot from the previous closing. Although the selling users took advantage of the high price to emerge, the potential was always extremely stable. The transaction of the famous shares was very large. Due to the recovery of confidence, the rubber shares also rebounded.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Merchants Most Like Gunpowder Smell; Japanese Attempt to Advance South Recreates Opportunities for Rice Merchants; Foreign Rice Reaches Price Limit, Indica Rice Drastically Increased by Three Yuan; But the Source Still Has More Than 40,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Since the South Seas situation became tight a week ago, the foreign rice market has driven the market to see repeated price increases, and the hoarding power is getting higher and higher, and the search is becoming more and more urgent. In fact, Japan still does not dare to try easily. The United States, Central Netherlands, and Australia have been prepared. The dream of advancing south will not break out under the heavy force for a while, unless there is a major change in the European situation. However, in general, this is a concern, so at the opening yesterday, the rising wind became even more intense. Before the opening, actual sales were the first priority, and they had been searching in various ways. In addition, the floating hoarding retail investors fueled the waves, which led to the sellers' minds being firmer and the profit recovery was stronger. By the middle of the market, all the prices of various goods, except for the middle and second-grade goods, had reached the price limit. If the small patterns of Pudong Wharf also reached 75 yuan and nine jiao, although the market had hit a wall after that, the selling atmosphere was still strong, without the slightest retreat, and the bee movement was abnormal all the way, and the closing was still firm. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon is 85 yuan, Zhongguan 84 yuan to 83 yuan and a half, No. 2 is 80 yuan, second is 78 yuan and a half, No. 1 Siam is 85 yuan to 83 yuan and a half, Huojiao is 84 yuan to 83 yuan, Xiaojiao is 76 yuan and eight jiao and 75 yuan and a half, Min Dang rice is 86 yuan, Dajiao is 75 yuan, Miliu is 70 yuan to 71 yuan, broken tip is 67 yuan to 65 yuan, and Wuhu tip is 76 yuan and three jiao. Compared with the prices mentioned above, the prices have risen by another yuan and a half from the week before, but the goods on the way are coming to Shanghai one after another, and have not been interrupted. On the contrary, the new order is passed through the exchange rate lengthening, and Heyi Foreign Company also has 5,000 tons of Xiaowen in March for sale in the market, at a price of 88 yuan. It is said that it is still in the electric commercial ship position, which is still similar to the previous market. It is also rumored that there are many direct orders in the brewing, so the prices of various rice in the futures market rise and fall, and the result is only four or five jiao higher than last Saturday. The opening-out call back Huasi No. 1 Saigon is now 99 yuan and a half, No. 2 is 92 yuan and four jiao, and Xiaojiao is now 90 yuan and one jiao to five jiao. The goods loaded on January 15 are 90 yuan, February is 88 yuan and two jiao, 88 yuan and a half, 89 yuan, and February and March are 88 yuan and three jiao. The transaction is nearly 2,000 tons, and there are also more than 15,000 bags of spot goods.</p>
<p>At a glance, the arrival of foreign rice is still in large batches, one after another. Yihua Foreign Company's Mingsheng wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (Sunday), carrying 21,767 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel also arrived in port on Sunday, carrying 4,649 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the main bank wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. Fork Taikoo Company's Guangdong wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 7,627 bags from Hong Kong, and also docked at the main bank wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. There is also Suzhou wheel, which also arrived at the port yesterday afternoon, carrying 9,505 bags from Hong Kong, and temporarily stopped in Pudong, waiting to be moved to the Bund of the French Concession for unloading today.</p>
<p>Due to continuous rain, the source of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice has been cut off, and at the appropriate market rumors, the question of soaring foreign rice, people's hearts are particularly excited. The goods are scarce and precious, so most of the cargo owners regard them as rare goods and shout wildly, and the shopkeepers also need them urgently. Seeing that the market goods are not enough to be distributed, they are afraid of being left out, so they compete with each other regardless of the high price. Therefore, the market has become an unexpected violent rise. If Qingjiao see thin rice open 99 yuan to 96 yuan and a half, the original bag is 102 yuan, and it has drastically increased by three yuan, and the Kunshan original white japonica rice opens 108 yuan to 106 yuan, and the view sees 102 yuan to 100 yuan, especially 104 yuan, which has also increased by about two yuan. As for the lack of goods in the special goods of Changbang, there is no market.</p>
<p>Although the actual sales of glutinous rice are still not smooth, most major households see that the prices of various goods are soaring, and they regard the glutinous rice price as uniquely flat, and they recognize that they can make profits, and they hoard them a lot. Therefore, once the selling price is attracted, it also increases by about one yuan, opening Hong Kong special 82 yuan, ordinary 81 yuan, 80 yuan, and glutinous tea 745 yuan.</p>
<h3>Over Ten Thousand Bags of Flour Arrive in Shanghai: Market Fluctuates Before Stabilizing</h3>
<p>The flour market, including both foreign and domestic flour, experienced initial tightness followed by stabilization yesterday. Since rumors of U.S.-Japan tensions spread late last week, speculation and hoarding were rampant. At the opening, with rice prices already high, Zhonglou brand foreign flour soared to $24.40, up 20 cents from before. However, rumors circulated in the afternoon that Wei Da Foreign Firm and others had received telegrams stating that large shipments of Canadian and Australian flour, initially over 100,000 bags, were expected to arrive today, with subsequent batches following closely. This led to a slight decrease in actual demand from local buyers, and more sellers were eager to offload goods en route. Few buyers were interested, except for the highly regarded Hongri Dangtian flour, which attracted some bulk buyers. Over 300 bags of this flour were traded yesterday at $24.80 per bag. Flour from domestic factories was still sold at a flat rate of $23, with over 6,000 bags released from both factories. The market outlook suggests that with the continuous arrival of goods, prices may have difficulty remaining high.</p>
<p>The wheat market yesterday remained stagnant. There was almost no activity, as shipments from inland areas were cut off due to rain, and Japanese factories had no stock to collect. Restrictions were temporarily not eased. Domestic factories had access to newly arrived foreign wheat, allowing for a slight increase in flour production. Therefore, the market saw no significant development.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Rampant Speculation, Unpredictable Soybean Cake Prices</h3>
<p>The soybean cake market yesterday fluctuated wildly amidst numerous rumors, emboldening speculators. The soybean oil market opened with an unstable trend, dropping by about one dollar from the end of last week. Later, positive sentiment grew, and the atmosphere became tense, resulting in prices exceeding the previous day's by 50 cents to one dollar. 400 barrels of Dalian spot oil were traded, initially at $112, then falling to $111.75, before rebounding to $113.50. 200 barrels for March delivery were traded at $113.75 to $114. 500 barrels for April delivery fell from $114.75 to $113.75, before jumping to $115.75. Peanut oil and tung oil rose by one dollar, while basketed oil remained stable. The destination of spot soybean cake included three trucks of Yuanlong cake and one truck of Feizi cake procured by inland agents. Speculation continued to dominate the forward market, with bulls and bears battling fiercely throughout the day, causing prices to fluctuate wildly. Initially rising and then falling in the morning, the near-term contracts closed slightly higher by three or four cents compared to Saturday, while the long-term contracts fell by three cents. The afternoon session reversed the morning trend, with buyers flooding the market. At the peak, prices briefly rose by another cent, but were eventually suppressed by aggressive short selling, leading to a soft close. 20,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cake for March delivery were traded at prices ranging from $14.25 to $14.30, then falling to $14.18. Over 20,000 pieces for late March delivery were traded at prices ranging from $14.32 to $14.18, then rebounding to $14.46, before falling again to $14.40. Over 30,000 pieces for April delivery were traded at prices ranging from $14.40 to $14.37, then rising to $14.59, before falling again to $14.48.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Profit-Taking Covers Shorts, Cotton Yarn Experiences Minor Rebound</h3>
<p>The yarn market, after two days of sharp declines, experienced a slight rebound yesterday. At the same time, purchases by Hong Kong agents were more active than the previous day, alleviating concerns. The highest price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was $1284, and the lowest was $1232. It finally closed at $1264 in the afternoon and fell to $1260 then rising slightly to $1230. 55 bales of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>The opening sentiment for Shuangma yarn was still weak, but slightly firmer than the previous day. Due to the significant decline, profit-takers covered their short positions. The opening price was $1240, falling slightly to $1232. News of stable gold prices led to a rebound, and profit-takers again came in to buy, boosting confidence and pushing the market from low to high, gradually rising to $1283. Unexpectedly, as prices rose, selling pressure increased, and prices suddenly fell to $1255. However, a large player covered their short position and turned slightly bullish, causing the market to rebound to $1269 at the close. Total transaction volume for half the day was 8850 bales. A breakdown of purchases by various agencies is listed below:</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>The spot cotton market remained sluggish and inactive. This was due to the uncertainty in the yarn market, which initially rose in the morning but fell sharply in the afternoon, further impacting the cotton market.</p>
<p>In the New York cotton market, spot traders and southern agencies were both selling, leading to a weak market due to heavy selling pressure. As a result, closing prices continued to fall by six or seven points from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to unrest in the Pacific region. Although it briefly rebounded due to short covering, it eventually fell again as long positions were liquidated. Yesterday, futures prices fell by 1.5 rupees.</p>
<p>Although the yarn market in Shanghai showed signs of recovery yesterday, and the exchange rate further eased, creating favorable conditions for raw cotton trading, overall confidence remained low, resulting in a quiet market with no sign of any impulse to trade.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Sluggish Sales, Minimal Price Increases</h3>
<p>The piece goods market initially rose and then fell yesterday, with a weakening trend. At the start of the morning, the exchange rate increased, which led to a rise in piece good prices. However, the ultimately inactive sales market resulted in a slight return of prices, and the sales market increased only slightly more than the previous Saturday. Fine cloth increased by 25 to 50 cents per piece, twill increased by 50 to 75 cents, coarse cloth increased by about 50 cents, and bleached and dyed cloth increased by nearly one dollar. Over 300 pieces of various fabrics were traded in this street, and the buyers were slightly active, but the quantity was minimal. Buyers from Wenzhou and Ningbo purchased 70 to 80 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth, buyers from Fujian purchased 50 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth, and buyers from Hong Kong purchased more than 100 pieces of twill and colored cloth.</p>
<p>The East cloth market lacked the strength to rise due to stagnant real sales from all regions. In the spot market, the opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was briefly called up to $43 due to the rebound in yarn prices and the cover from retail investors, but it quickly fell again after the industry quickly sold off at high prices. The morning closed at $42.50. In the afternoon, the price of gold continued to plummet, rumors flared up again, and the human heart was empty, and the price plunged to $40.03. The closing price of Sizijun serge was $1.13. The closing price of standard cloth futures (trading place) for this month was $42.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Continued Arrival of Foreign Sugar</h3>
<p>Shanghai sugar merchants were overjoyed by the expectation that Dutch sugar imports would be interrupted, and the price rose sharply. However, unexpectedly, large quantities continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Guangdong and Suzhou ships, in addition to large quantities of foreign rice, also brought a large amount of cane sugar. The Guangdong ship carried 8650 bags, and the Suzhou ship also carried 4050 bags. (</p>

<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Reward for Capturing the British Prime Minister</h3>
<p>— Zhi Hui</p>
<p>In the winter of the year before last, the British Royal Air Force flew over German skies for the first time, not dropping a single bomb, but merely scattering some "paper bombs"—leaflets—and returning. At that time, it aroused the ridicule and mockery of the shrimp soldiers and crab generals under Hitler, who believed that the British Air Force was exposing its weakness and was not worth attacking. However, on the other hand, the German people were strictly forbidden to pick up British leaflets, otherwise they would face the danger of being executed.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when Hitler launched an aerial blitz against England last year, he also copied the old British tactic that the Germans had ridiculed. It turned out that they were also good at using "paper bomb warfare." The British accepted the German "paper bombs" very calmly. Fearing that most people would not know the contents of the "paper bombs" in detail, London newspapers specially printed them, which could be regarded as fulfilling the greatest publicity obligation for Hitler.</p>
<p>The front of the "paper bomb" was a small portrait of British Prime Minister Churchill, holding a light submachine gun, with an appearance very similar to a bandit in an American detective film. Above it was the title "Reward," and below it was: "Capture this instigator of war." The British Prime Minister in this photo also had a cigar in his mouth and a smiling face. The back of the photo was several lines of not-so-fluent English: "This rogue in the photo, he encourages you to wage war like him, making all women, children, and innocent people his pioneers. All wars have long been prohibited by the Hague Peace Conference. Why not bring this autocratic demon who incites war to a military court? Quickly save this war disaster, or at least save your own family!"</p>
<p>Churchill himself, after reading this "wanted" leaflet, couldn't help but recall another incident in the past: Thirty-eight years ago, during the South African Boer War, Churchill was a young reporter, serving as a war correspondent. Once, he was captured by the enemy and imprisoned. After several twists and turns, he finally escaped. At that time, because a prisoner had escaped from the enemy camp, such a notice could be seen everywhere on the thoroughfares of Transvaal:</p>
<p>Heavy Reward for Capture—Dead or Alive!</p>
<p>American, 25 years old, tall, about eight feet high; no particularly noticeable physical characteristics, but slightly stooped when walking; fair complexion, reddish-brown hair, no beard; often speaks with a nasal tone, and cannot pronounce the S sound very clearly.</p>
<p>These two famous "wanted" encounters in Churchill's life are now widely circulated among British men, women, old, and young, becoming a very interesting topic of conversation.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>Children's Voices of Reading</h3>
<p>— Ke Ting</p>
<p>More than a year ago, when we first moved here, we often heard the sound of reading aloud in the morning and evening. It was a child of about ten years old who lived downstairs from us. When I first stepped into their room, I found three school reward frames hanging on the dim walls, adding a lot of glory.</p>
<p>His father was a worker in a silk factory, working day and night shifts. He and his mother had to handle all the housework and take care of a younger brother. Sometimes before I got up in the morning, I could already hear him reading. Sometimes when I passed by the railing in the middle of the night, I could still see him doing his homework, because he wouldn't have time to do it at home during the day.</p>
<p>My acquaintance with him was already near the end of that semester. He couldn't do a few arithmetic problems and came to ask me, looking embarrassed. He listened quietly and remembered all the steps I showed him. Finally, I asked him about the next semester, but he said unhappily:</p>
<p>"Dad said we can't even afford to eat, what's the point of studying?"</p>
<p>"Oh," I paused slightly and replied with one word, but many unspoken words welled up in my heart. Looking into his eyes, which were also filled with tears, I told him to go home and do his homework quickly, so as not to cause him pain. He lowered his head and walked out very quickly.</p>
<p>Sure enough, he could no longer go to school to study the next semester. Every night I taught him a little Chinese and arithmetic. During the day, he went to the streets to sell sweet potatoes and broad beans. Seeing that the semester was about to end, I didn't talk to his parents about sending him back to school the next semester. I knew that even too much sympathy could not replace the shortcomings of reality.</p>
<p>Recently, one evening, the child suddenly came in holding several textbooks in his arms, smiling and saying to me:</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, I'm going back to school, these are the new books."</p>
<p>I flipped through the new books and asked him how much the tuition was. He said:</p>
<p>"Dad said that the factory increased it by five cents a day, which is just enough for me to study for half a year, and my uncle paid the rest for me." The child revealed happiness when he said this. He poured out a few cooked broad beans from his pocket, saying that they were what he had left over from selling that day. Starting tomorrow, he won't be selling things, and these were given to me to eat, to thank me for teaching him for the past year.</p>
<p>I couldn't find words to say to him for a moment. Looking at the flat and large broad beans, I could only thank him. He seemed happy that I had received his affection and generous gift, smilingly told me to try them, and jumped and ran downstairs.</p>
<p>In the past two days, I have heard the sound of the child's reading again in the morning and evening. I get joy from the sound of reading, and I know that what his parents get is joy and comfort that exceeds joy.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Xiangqi looked at her mother's gloomy face, which had almost wiped out all the joy of her graduating first in her class.</p>
<p>"But... but... can't... blame... your... father..." Her mother said with tears in her eyes, "He... copies... books... for... people... every... night..., often... copies... until... midnight... before... resting.... Recently, his... eyes... have... a problem..."</p>
<p>A wave of sadness suddenly surged into Xiangqi's heart, causing her to sob uncontrollably.</p>
<p>She remembered that when her father sent her to the women's normal school four years ago, he was wearing a ramie gown that was already two years old. But today, when he went to the women's normal school at Principal Hou's invitation, she clearly saw that he was still wearing this old gown, which was as yellow as amber, and had been torn in several places. The hardship of his life in recent years was enough to be explained by this gown. Four years ago, her brother was very robust, although he had been sent to a satin shop as an apprentice. But now? He has become a patient who often coughs up blood!</p>
<p>"Please rest for a while! When father comes back, there will definitely be good news." Xiangqi knew that her mother always had to sleep for one or two hours every afternoon - this was the only tonic she could get - so she tried her best to persuade her to temporarily forget all the pain and slowly close her eyes to sleep.</p>
<p>Xiangqi herself was still sitting on the edge of the bed, driving away mosquitoes for her mother while thinking deeply.</p>
<p>She began to blame herself! A few days ago, she really shouldn't have stubbornly refused the position as a tutor introduced to her by Principal Hou. If she had accepted it, it would at least make her mother feel more relieved now! (33)</p>

<h3>Rare Total Solar Eclipse</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The total solar eclipse on September 21st at noon (i.e. the first day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar) has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. A total solar eclipse is indeed a rare opportunity, because solar eclipses are common, but total solar eclipses have only occurred a few times in recent years, and they were all abroad. The total eclipse time is mostly up to five minutes, and at least one or two minutes, and what you see beyond this is not a total eclipse. Because the sun is large, the moon is small, and the earth rotates quickly, it passes in an instant, and not every place can see it. Foreigners record the scene of a total solar eclipse is very beautiful, but unfortunately China alone does not have such records. Judging from the records of solar eclipses in historical books, by inference, there are only two cases that are equivalent to a total solar eclipse.</p>
<p>(1) In the first year of Deyou of Emperor Gong of Song, on the first day of the sixth month Gengzi, there was a solar eclipse, and stars were seen, and chickens and ducks all returned, which is 1275 in the Western calendar, which can be determined to be a total eclipse.</p>
<p>(2) In the twenty-ninth year of Yuan Shizu Zhiyuan (1292 in the Western calendar), on the first day of the first month Jiawu, there was a solar eclipse, and something gradually invaded the sun. It could not be finished, and the sun looked like a golden ring, with lobes on the left and right, and an aura above.</p>
<p>This seems to be a ring eclipse. According to scientists' calculations, a total solar eclipse can be seen every 200 years in a fixed location, but on the day of the total eclipse, the sky must be clear and bright to be seen. Moreover, the shadow belt where the total eclipse can be seen on the ground is very narrow, so even in China, people outside the shadow belt will only see a solar eclipse, not a total eclipse. We only hope that victory will come soon, transportation will be restored, and we will be able to go to the total eclipse zone in China to appreciate it, which is a rare and joyful event.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Lili</p>
<p>I will be honest because they trust me.</p>
<p>Let me live in a house by the roadside, to be friends with mankind.</p>
<p>To young people I say, "Look at yourselves." You have to spend some time reflecting every day, and maybe you will find many shortcomings in yourself.</p>
<p>Don't leave a single dark spot on your bright mind, but keep a sacred record.</p>
<p>Reading the biographies of great men is another way to recognize yourself. Compare their lives with your own, and sometimes you will discover the truth from the comparison.</p>

<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3>"Spring Breeze Returns to Dreams"</h3>
<p>— Mo Ye</p>
<p>Adaptation means re-creation, especially adapting a novel into a movie, which requires a process of refinement and extraction. Otherwise, the audience will be confused, and the director will only be able to spend more than half of the film on the introduction, which will become a mess. "Romance of the West Chamber" is one example.</p>
<p>Some people sigh that Shanghai film directors do not understand "montage" and tend to become comic strips. Undoubtedly, this is a fact. "Spring Breeze Returns to Dreams" managed to avoid these, but it did not highly utilize cinematic techniques. This can be said to be the biggest difficulty in adapting a novel.</p>
<p>Liu Yunruo is a strong general in the Mandarin Ducks and Butterflies school. This work, which opposes the old ethics and describes the lives of young people under the feudal system, seems to be his progress. However, he failed to develop the very good subject matter into an anti-feudal theme. The biggest shortcoming of the movie is also the same. Movies aimed at the petty bourgeoisie, due to their lack of knowledge and unclear themes, often have counterproductive effects. Moreover, without a theme, it cannot become a work of art.</p>
<p>The directing technique is quite simple. However, several shots of Feng Rulian (Tong Yuejuan) singing drum Beijing opera are too lengthy and stagnant. The most successful part, I think, is the grasp of the rhythm, the strengthening of the atmosphere, and the proper setting of the camera angles. Such as: the wedding night; the Mid-Autumn Festival night; the scene of Li Fang (Li Hong) dying of illness, are all handled very well, which can be said to be tightly holding the audience's heartstrings. The guilt that should be borne is that it is not possible to find a way to emphasize the theme and highlight the theme.</p>
<p>The actors are also competent. Especially Li Hong, has a special performance and unexpected achievements. Since "Xi Shi" and other films, she has made a leap. Here, she shows the essence of the old woman under the feudal system, whether it is action or inner emotions, it makes people feel real.</p>
<p>Gu Yelu (as Lu Jingbao) did not perform badly, and was able to convey the character of the intellectual class, but at the end, he was not able to perform the inner contradictory psychology of "loving Rulian and pitying his wife". The habitual movements on the stage have been reduced a lot.</p>
<p>Due to her own rich life experience, Tong Yuejuan has the status of a female actor, but there are many places lacking emotion.</p>
<h3>Scattered Notes on the Art World</h3>
<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>Xia Yan's "Heart Defense" will soon be performed in Chongqing by the "China Long Live Troupe" (said to be an organization of colleagues from the China Film Studio), directed by Zhang Min.</p>
<p>The famous cartoonist Hu Kao has entered Chongqing via northern Shaanxi and has reportedly joined the China Film Studio as a set designer.</p>
<p>Jin Yan and Wang Renmei may not give up their "profession" temporarily in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Lu Ming recently sent a letter to a friend in Shanghai, mentioning that Shanghai newspapers said that he had come to Shanghai to shoot a film at Yihua, saying: "Even I don't know about this."</p>
<p>The Minhua Tongle Club decided to hold a performance after the filming of "Song of Ancient China". The repertoire is extremely "grand". "Killing the Family" has Yan Fei as the teacher, and Wang Yin, Shushi, Zhang Yi, and Liu Qiong as the little teachers. It is really a mighty and invincible lineup.</p>
<p>The filming of "Rejuvenation Incense" by the United Film Company (this incense is not what Yang Xiangwu has in Beijing Opera, but is adapted by Tu Guangqi based on "Di Si Niang", starring Ying Yin) will start on the 20th. It is now rushing to make costumes. This is the second film produced in the name of "Huacheng". It is said that the third film has been internally set as "Killing the Son for Revenge", starring Wang Xichun. Perhaps Wang Xichun is not playing the cruel woman who killed her son.</p>
<p>When the Film Association held its annual meeting this year, there was a "tidbit" that could be recorded: one was that Luo Xuelian, the head of the Central Photography Studio, and Dang Zhen, the head of the China Film Studio, kissed on the spot, and the other was that He Feiguang and Chen Tianguo quarreled. He also drew a gun and shot Chen, but fortunately did not hit him. Shi Dongshan, Ying Yunwei, and others persuaded them to stop.</p>
<h3>A Record of Female Sculptor Mrs. Bi Feiliefu</h3>
<p>Russian female sculptor Mrs. Bi Feiliefu (Madame Pertilie) has been engaged in sculpture for more than 20 years. Her works are exquisite and noble and have long been famous in the overseas art world.</p>
<p>At first, Bi studied at the most prestigious academic research association in St. Petersburg and was a student of famous sculptors Chayermen and Lisixifumen. Because she was able to earnestly seek progress, she gained all the strengths of the two masters and had the reputation of being even better than her teachers. In 1926, Bi traveled far to Rome to seek further study. She practiced at the Rome Academy of Fine Arts for ten years, and her name gradually became known. She held an exhibition at the 94th National Academy of Fine Arts Exhibition in Rome in 1928, and also held exhibitions in 1929 and 1932. There are countless other individual exhibitions. Bi is especially specialized in making bronze busts. Princes such as Louise Pury, the Holy King, and Red Cardinal Ribishia have all had Bi make portraits for them, and some are even proud to obtain Bi's works.</p>
<p>Bi lives at No. 17, Apartment 3211, Badang Road, French Concession. She specializes in Chinese art and has also held individual exhibitions. People from all walks of life have asked her to make portraits, which is quite busy. It is also heard that Bi plans to set up a school in Shanghai to promote this art. For young people in Shanghai who love this art, it is a truly rare opportunity.</p>
<h3>Talking About "Selling the Horse"</h3>
<p>— Jing Ying</p>
<p>"Selling the Horse" is a popular play that almost every famous actress has performed in the past decade. Many people only know this play as a Kunqu Opera, but it is actually a Chuichang Opera. The easiest way to distinguish between Kunqu Opera and Chuichang Opera is that Kunqu Opera does not have interludes, while Chuichang Opera does. Therefore, this play was not considered a formal opera in the early years.</p>
<p>It is said that Zhu Lianfen was extremely famous for this play in the early years. Wang Guiguan was also very good before he switched to playing young male roles. Zhu Youfen and Chen Delin have also performed it, but "Selling the Horse" was not popular for several years. Its current popularity is due to Mei Lanfang. I know there are several versions of this play. One was self-written by Gai Jiaotian, another was performed by Gui Junqing in Shanghai, and the third is the common version of Gui Zhi writing a petition and the three reuniting. Gai Jiaotian's version is his own creation. It starts with Li Qi selling horses. Li Qi is dressed as a horse trader from Guandong, fully equipped with real knives and guns, portraying Li Qi as generous and righteous, making many friends. One day, he sees injustice on the road and accidentally kills the son of an official. The authorities arrest him urgently. Li Qi bids farewell to his friends, takes his wife, and flees back to his hometown. He later has a daughter (Gui Zhi) and a son (Bao Tong). More than ten years later, his wife dies. Because there is no one to manage the household, he marries a widow, Madam Yang, from the neighboring village. The following part connects to the version performed by Gui Junqing: Li Qi's old friend invites Li to go outside the pass to sell horses. Li cannot refuse, so he bids farewell to Madam Yang and his children and leaves. After Li leaves, Yang has an affair with the local bailiff, Tian Wang, which is discovered by Bao Tong. Madam Yang plots to drive Bao Tong and Gui Zhi away. Bao Tong jumps into the river and is rescued by a fisherman, who adopts him as his godson. Gui Zhi searches for her brother without success and attempts suicide in the forest. Li Qi's good friend, Liu Zhiquan, passes by while collecting debts and saves Gui Zhi, adopting her as his goddaughter and renaming her Liu. Liu has a fellow student, Zhao Rongsen, who brings his son, Zhao Chong, to visit Zhiquan. Liu sees that Chong has handsome features and promises Gui Zhi to Zhao Chong. With the help of his godfather, Bao Tong goes to the capital to take the imperial examination. Zhao Rongsen dies of illness, and his second wife treats Zhao Chong badly. As the examination date approaches, Chong borrows travel expenses from his uncle Liu. Li Qi returns from selling horses. Zhao Chong marries in Liu's house, and after the wedding, he takes Gui Zhi to the capital. Li Qi returns home and asks about his children. Madam Yang claims they are dead. Li Qi knows something is wrong and tortures the maid Chunhua. Chunhua is in a dilemma and hangs herself. Tian Wang and Madam Yang plot to bribe the authorities, falsely accusing Li Qi of forcing Chunhua to commit suicide. Li Qi is forced to confess under torture in court. Zhao Chong passes the examination and is appointed magistrate of Bao Cheng County. Bao Tong passes the imperial examination and is bestowed the title of Imperial Inspector of Eight Prefectures. Zhao Chong goes to the countryside to promote agriculture, followed by the common versions of crying in prison, examining the prisoner, writing a petition, filing a lawsuit, breaking into the yamen, and the three reuniting. The best performances I have seen are by Mei Lanfang, Cheng Jixian, Zhang Chunyan, Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua; Cheng Yanqiu, Bai Yunsheng, Zhang Chunyan, Gu Juesun, Cao Yigeng, Han Shichang, Bai Yunsheng, Wei Qinglin; Zhu Chuanming, Ye ShengLan, Zheng Chuanjian, Zhou Chuanying; and Xin Yanqiu, Yu Zhenfei, Zhou Xinfang, and Han Jingui. Among them, Cheng Yanqiu's Gui Zhi is the most satisfying, followed by Mei Lanfang. Zhu Chuanming, Han Shichang, and Xin Yanqiu are a bit lacking. Cheng Jixian's Zhao Chong is excellent except for his voice and appearance. Bai Yunsheng is lively, Yu Zhenfei is refined, Ye Shenglan is delicate, and Jiang Miaoxiang is also good at playing Zhao Chong, but I think he only has a scholarly air and nothing else. Wei Qinglin's Li Qi has good expressions and voice; Zheng Chuanjian has spirit but lacks voice; Zhou Xinfang and Zhang Chunyan also have the same problem as Zheng Chuanjian. Gu Juesun is very competent as Li Baotong. Han Jingui's Hu LaoYe is too fiery, Cao Ergeng has a mercantile air, and Xiao Changhua is okay.</p>
