<h3>懲儆米蠧與民食</h3>
<p>上海第一特區法院刑庭，昨日對於超越限價，出賣食米的張某，判處徒刑十個月。輿情爲之衝動，到處資爲談助，或則拍手稱快，或則搖頭歎息。稱快者，因爲兩年來米價奇貴，直接鬧饑荒，間接使全般生活感受慘厲的影響，皆由奸蠧違反國家法令，不顧社會福利，肥己害人，逍遙自得；每一個吃飯的人，無不切齒痛恨，而無法伸訴；顧乃奸蠧也有髠髮赭衣，鎯鐺入獄的今天；拍手稱快，所以稍洩怨毒。歎息者，因爲米貴實緣產地遭遇暴力統制，而奸蠹之所以爲奸蠹，僅因未受敎育，缺乏理知，適逢法律與道德喪失統馭力量的時候，它們祗是孳孳牟利而根本不知道這是罪惡；即以罪惡而論，米業中的體面商人，確也很體面的再三表示同業良莠不齊，自有敗類；却沒有顧到米貴的事實說明了米業實爲敗類所操縱；操縱者如此，發財者如彼，而現在祇有張某的處刑十月安得不爲之歎息？但在張某，咎有應得，徒刑不足以蔽其辜，決不因多數巨奸大蠧的逍遙法外而誰竟同情張某。</p>
<p>上海眞是一個「特區」，中國的特區，國際的特區，世界的特區！歐戰爆發之後，許多新鮮而現實的事例與敎訓，擺在上海人的面前。在戰爭中的各國，人民日常生活所需的物品，或斷絕了供給，或减少了生產，於是概由當局統盤籌算，加以管理，關於各物的品質，數量，賣價，各有嚴格規定，甚或禁絕了輸入流通與消耗。若乃百貨並陳一如平時，自由買賣一如平時，生活日用品而賣價數十倍於平時的，像今日的特區上海，眞是有獨無偶。然而上海人每每忘却了這是戰時」這是「特區」，除了手頭法幣所限，每每不知亟自節制；倘若有所不平，有所不如意或不滿足，則又每每解釋爲中國政府機能殆不如歐戰中的諸國。即如眼見米商盈利鉅萬，平民粒食維艱，便有儼然明白天下大事的人們，喟然於「他國安容麵包店大發國難財！」其實祇有上海，到了昨日纔援引戰時法令而懲儆罪人。</p>
<p>國民政府公布「非常時期評定物價及取締投機操縱辦法」，還是二十八年二月間的事；同年十二月間，又公布了「日用必需品平價購銷辦法」，「取締囤積日用必需品辦法」。非常時期評定物價及取締投機操縱辦法共十五條，規定各地方應設平價委員會；對於評定日用必需品的價格，設有三項公允的標準；對於工廠商號的產銷，以及市面供求的情况，必以調査爲措施的根據；對於貨品，得依法定程序與手續，强制出售；對於奸蠹，得依法檢舉，聽候制裁。這些條款之在上海，幾乎無不等於具文；雖法令不盡能推行上海的原因不止一端，而上海物價昂貴亦別有其法令不行以外的他種原因，然而上海官民的習於放縱，弁髦法令，事屬不可諱飾，馴致一般的生活艱難，社會的危機四伏，亦可謂其間至少有一部分乃是自食其惡果。吾則，昨日之前，必已有無數入獄的張某；而奸蠹經盡情法辦之後，必能相當阻遏市面上的凶燄。</p>
<p>懲一儆百，當然有其必要；社會輿情且渴望上海當局自此執法相繩，繼續作更大規模的檢舉，更嚴厲的懲儆。但上海冶安與居民生活，所受米價以及其他物價的威脅，必不因懲儆奸蠹而遽得减輕或解除；不但不得减輕與解除，且或因各方面先以泡有不健全的認識，繼以不謀健全的辦法，乃至遭受另一方式的更嚴重威脅。例以米價問題：市上盛傳體面米商早已收縮營業矣，一爲不甘同流合汚，二爲顧慮不法覬覦，三爲恐負奸蠧惡名云云；又傳民食來源，端賴米商轉運維持，若米商旣負折本之危險，又負不白之寃枉，再加以嚴格之檢舉懲儆，勢必裏足不前，試問誰來供給民食云云。諸如此類，皆神似而動聽，於是老成持重者，相戒以母操切。莫敢操切，於杲因循迄今者二三年。利用因循，於是從容買賣其間者，體面人若干輩，盈利稱百萬干萬焉。投鼠忌器，於是鼠輩跳梁。爲今之計，能疏通來源，自是上策，但予取生殺之權在他人。舉辦平糶，自是慈善，但吃平糶米者，必須每日糶米；未能像平糶的或斷或續。且大多數市民不願佔光慈善，但願自食其力；則莫如從財力通融着手，以推廣集團購米的辦法。集團辦法若能普遍。然後威脅無自而作祟，然後有僅取微利的體面米商。</p>

<p>洋米市自今庚開市、連續兩朝、奔騰二三元後、昨以升無可升、又呈擯持之局面、受限貨無論中關及高貨、悉無出樣、僅碎米與米菉充斥市塲、致一般實銷欲謀添購、均屬向隅無着、此種現狀、殊非民食之福、租界對於調節民食、迄今仍無具體辦法、　價暗盤交易、雖無從調查、但傳聞暗中仍活躍異常、度其生活者頗多、一號西貢有售九十三四元、二號每百包貼六百元、續提一元之說、小絞祇路貨以（一百六十斤）計算、售七十七元、米菉及碎米因貨湧銷滯、尙保守限般盤、開米菉七十八元、决七十六元三角、碎尖七十六元次七十四元、栖六十八元八角、</p>
<p>厚薄粳國米利貨卽續寥落、而本街去路因感受洋米無貨購得之苦、遂都不得已採購國米、以備不時之需、一時買氣頓旺、在供求不勻之下、市面更復激增、厚薄兩粳價、但續暴漲二三元之巨、若崑山斛見白粳開一百零六元半、一百零六元、靑角薄稻斛見開一百零一元、一百元、此誠開米市未有之紀錄、照此情形而論、若此一路上漲不已、則將來米價之昂貴、奚有底止、而一般平民生計、實有陷於絕境、父豈上海租界之福、</p>
<p>糯米獨以輔助之品、去路有限、且以洋糯存積頗豐、故市面難能變化、仍處於平平、僅糯菉因售價較他貨爲最廉、頗多採納、行情亦增元砠、計開宜溧國元仍爲九十二三元、香港元開八十三元、次至七十九元半、而糯菉開高自七十六元、次至七十二元半、</p>
<p>洋米大量到滬、太古公司江蘇輸、由香港運來一萬零三百五十九包、昨晨抵埠、停靠法租界外灘碼頭起卸、又該公司經理之法輪Tranninh號、由海防直接裝來一萬九千一百四十三包、昨午到滬、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、昨日共到洋米二萬九千五百零二包、（祖）</p>
<p>昨日洋米現貨被國米騰漲牽制、執貨者莫不以奇貨可居、堅持不肯出樣、故市上交易除少數中决點綴外、仍以碎雜各米居多、西貢一二號幾至絕跡、惟暗盤貼費等情亦可發現、良以限價迄米見鬆馳、又被大批洋米新交易所威脅、貨方亦難以繼續在暗中抬價、蓋行團客戶或到改辦國米或則注神期貨、或則懾於定貨之多而觀望不前、故現洋米交易祇五千包、而期貨回籠有千噸以上、回籠市面早市一度喊高、旋以定貨擁擠、價又隨人心向下、一號西貢一月份開九十八元、二月九十三元、小絞路貨八十七元、一月份八十六元、一月十五日八十四元半、二月八十四元、均與前價相似、新交易總計不下十萬多包、（合一萬多噸）、計小絞一二月份約有八千噸左右、因一部份尙未配齊額數、統由愼記洋行拋出、價八十四元半至八十四元、西貢一號一月份合義洋行拋出一千噸價九十六元、鼎泰拋二月份一千噸、價九十三元、萬興拋二月份一號西貢一千噸、價九十二元六角云、</p>
<h3>平賣粉繼續供應　廠盤改爲二十一元五角</h3>
<p>麵粉　査本市華廠平賣盼、自去年底終止後、市面一度恐慌、致洋粉激漲近二元之鉅、平民麵食、更受重大影響、昨經常局與行廠方面商定、繼續平賣仍山福新廠每日供給三千一百包、阜豐供給一千包、其餘仍用洋粉搭配、惟廠盤已改爲二十一元五角、比前價增高每包三元五角、雖曰平賣、小民已不勝其負担也、至洋粉交易、因平賣粉卽已有供應、本街需要、當然减退、客銷亦嫌價昂、無意多取、漲風頓息、惟售手依然擯持、不願輕脫、統市做開鐘樓花鳥牌澳粉一萬包强、價爲二十四元五角及四角七分半、其他概無妥交、</p>
<p>又訊　昨據洋行消息、新到五燕牌澳粉九千包、由香港船運滬、起卸於外灘金利源棧、聞該貨品質與花烏鐘樓相仿、尙未出樣開售、聞維大洋行定開坎粉十萬包、合價二十二元七八角、</p>
<p>小麥　咋小麥交易、寂寞如常、天雨各地來源更稀、各粉廠欲購無貨、市塲中祇有喊價、而無實交、目下一般執貨者、鑒於粉價之昂貴、原料居奇益甚、日廠方面仍擬吸收期貨、而行商並無拋開，聞租界貨價須三十五元左右、日廠進價亦須三十元外、市面不脫堅靜之局、</p>
<h3>糖市　日商乘低吸收　糖價跌勢轉緩</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢甚軟、續見下降、後爲日商收進粗白及B嘜車白共達四五千包、未致大跌、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧七十九元六角、小四角、荷赤現貨六十七元五角至二角、小八角、一月十五日打單六十七元七角至三角、小七角、太古車白B嘜七十九元三角至一角、後則七十九元小七角、DY嘜七十八元、小三角、HX嘜七十七元七角至五角、小五角、H嘜車赤東棧六十四元小六角半、六日香港來糖七百五十七包、</p>
<h3>證券　統甲超過法定限價　各債又各漲一元以上</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日已恢復全日交易、市況突飛猛晉有非言語可以形容者、五種公債、上下午逐盤隨時發見新高價、甲種已穿出八一三以後府掛牌法定限價七十六元以、此種公債第十一决抽籤、定於二月十日舉行、抽籤支數驟增至三十六支、爲期亦愈趨愈短、故比其他爲特優、美國五千萬元對華基金合同行將簽定、故「江寗」銀行雖已開辦、而上海市面一般金融狀態一如平昔、屆此利息行將到期及普通存息减低之際、市價繼續上漲、並非意外、目下斷不可以往年普通眼光來測度市况、因目下利息猶合一分、以上、昨日買進各戶、除一半補空者及少數浮多外、頗有金融機關大量吸收之事實、如裕興信孚聯和樂茂中一等家、均係上下午逐項買進、餘則上午有怡泰仁昌大通同順、下午有聚豐協康震康順泰及十六號或補空、或做多、問時賣出者、如潤利生大聚昌同康、或放空或了多亦頗踴躍、其餘如鴻大松茂、永康協康、下午如甡昶易中聯益震康等、均係賣出、市塲非常熱鬧、潛勢亦頗有力、前途方興未艾也、市價結果一致上騰一元二角至一元九角半、成交總數的計二百日六十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商電氣一百股、價爲八元二角、比前漲八角云、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤、因上週逾額多頭獲利出籠、略呈軟化、入後多數實業股並無大上落、成交則夥、國際信託公司股因宣布將發紅股、價較上週末漲達三元、收盤爲三十一元、上海銀公司股因據報去年度盈利頗佳、價亦堅挺非凡、橡皮股甚穩定、各投資股需求良好、</p>
<h3>國際信托發新股</h3>

<h3>紗花　業外翻空　雙馬慘跌　—惟同業間有乘賤吃進—</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、且跌風允熾、此因外匯轉向放長、而黃金下挫、因之人心益覺軟化、至於金子幫完全根據以上情形作伸縮、所以大都由多翻空、檯面由此大鬆、惟同業中一半早已不做雙馬、有一半已翻多頭、心思看好、本日仍在買進中、於是情况尙平定、至於實銷、香港幫零星採辦尙稱不弱也、二十支雙馬高價戶一千三百八十元、低盤價爲一千三百四十五元、午後雙馬始做一千三百四十六元、繼爲一千三百五十三元、最後價爲一千三百四十九元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、人氣尚和善、不過新買風不强、首盤價爲一千三百八十元、旋聞外滙開市由鬆而放長、一般見風使舵者、羣爭賣出、生大亦步步向出、以致情况鬆動、市盤越做越小、但在一千三百六十二三元之間、迥旋殊久、時近十一時半、後因黃金乏力、日見下降、浮多惶恐、直下至一千三百叫十五元、收盤稍振、爲一千三百四十七元、查半日間成交統計五千九百五十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌三十四元、又棉紗今日有一百十五件、運往香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列於左</p>

<h3>印棉昨有到滬　—但到源日見稀少—</h3>
<p>現棉情況、依然暗無精彩、此因外匯轉趨長途、且傳棉紗滬西幫已出籠、市面或有看鬆　步、所以棉市更少生色、不過存貨日趨枯涸矣、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市況頗爲靜寂、因現貨商及海外商之拋賣、結果收盤價格較之六日降落二三磅音、印度市况平平、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來繼續靜寂異常、華商廠方購意始終淡薄、然日廠之購意却勿見轉濃、同業間交易亦未見活躍、據可靠之統計、原棉來貨日見稀少、故預測將來之棉仍抱樂觀也、</p>
<p>印棉有到埠、大英公司經理之澤生輪、近目喀爾喀搭裝棉花六千四百五十件、前日（星期日）抵滬、停吿浦東其昌淺起抑、（祖）</p>
<h3>金融　外匯多方求售愈切</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、趣勢鬆動、此因投機興趣集中賣出、人心安靜、扒戶已少、至英美等外銀行、尙具吃胃、但美滙一度已硬達五元五九三七五、午刻穩定、後市沉寂、投機商湧塞、與華行等吸進相抵、故價無上落、晚收英滙三辦士五三一二五、美滙五元五六二五、比上週六收各鬆〇三一二五、</p>
<p>外銀行亦有供給</p>
<p>晨初以滙兌英對美·滬等俱平、美對英·滬等亦均未更、中央掛牌名滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士半、美滙五元五三一二五、與上週六午收價相較、悉無變動、開後華商銀行暨投機商先後入市賣出、計英行滙豐及美行日行吸入華銀行現美滙爲五元五三一二五、以至五六二五、不久投機家賣興頗濃、塞予英美等行一月份美滙均硬爲五元五六二五、九點半滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅無上落、此後外銀行亦懷供意、潛勢再硬、計日行納入現美滙已吿五元五九三七五、且華商投機家續施賣出壓力、收盤前愈感鬆動、結果現貨英金收盤吿三辦士五三一二五、美滙五元五六二五、</p>
<p>期現一致見鬆動</p>
<p>後市較靜、投機商依然求售、但爲數微小、而華行稍有吃胃、美行仍肯收進、至價無變化、計本月份美滙華行上海及某美行進投機商價五元五六二五、晚收現貨本月份英金三辦士五三一二五、美滙五元五六二五、下月份英金三辦士五一五六二五、美滙五元五三一二五、較之上星期末收市價、期現美滙各長〇三一二五、英金期現亦鬆〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>經濟業談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>火油（一）</p>
<p>火油亦稱煤油，又稱石汕，初流行時，以其從外國來，故稱洋油。中國向用植物油燃燈，古代富貴之家，仍多燃蠟炬，宋寇準最豪侈，未嘗點油，雖溷軒馬廐，必用蠟炬，於此可證。植物油燃燈，用燈芯草引油發火，其光不明，故曰燈光如豆，言燈火之光，如黃豆般大也。</p>
<p>自火油來中國，至光緒二十年前後，始漸流行入內地，用者雖以其光明遠勝於油燈，但以一則礦物油與植物汕質地不同，火油易於引火，故以菜油豆油視火油者，時兆焚如。再則不能用舊時油燈點火油，而通常所用之「洋油手照」，不但容易倒翻，亦且油質不易燃盡，煤多氣惡，因之不能流行。美孚油行知其然，遂造成「美孚油燈」容油之器，底大而平，不至傾倒，而翻火油燈成火災之事漸少。有柄，可以手携，家庭用之始稱便。上有玻燈罩以遮風，移動之際，不易爲風吹滅。內有燈頭中銜紗帶以點火生光，並有捩旋以增減燈光之明暗，不但油中之煤質可以燃發殆盡，亦且燈光明亮，遠勝於舊時一燈熒熒矣。不僅此也，美孚行且於燈罩之上，油器之外表，俱印有「美孚行」或「點美孚油」字樣，其初贈送於用戶，其後用戶爭相購置，於是火油乃深入民間，無不知有所謂「老牌油」，蓋繼美孚油來者，尙有亞細亞等油，而以美孚爲老牌矣。（未完）</p>
<h3>大戶傾售　金市跌風擴大　最低見六三一零元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、跌風相當擴大、自晨至晚、連破五百與四百元關、直落至六千三百元關邊、原因匯市帶硬、人心萎疲、銀號幫先猛塞、聞其中滬西幫多頭公司出籠頗夥、價步步降落、加之午刻小錢莊幫力售、最低遂撳至六千三百十元、午收祗六千三百二十五元、午後始硬終軟、以證券幫略購、曾回達二千四百元、而銀號幫等見高再出延至收盤僅二千三百三十八元、結果軋小一百七十四元、全日交易約八九十兩、現金初由銀樓業出生元允二十兩價比期交低三十元、後又出三十兩價同、照美匯晚收一月期五元五六二五結價爲六千二百八十一元、計抬五十七元、銀樓飾金則低十元、關金等平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌一百七十餘元　　晨初人心已疲、故開盤銀號幫等撳價、首塞予金號二十兩、祗六千四百七十元、較上週末收價做低四十二元、此後除銀號猛塞外、聞滬西多頭公司出籠頗巨、至價愈軟弱、計銀號出金號三十兩、跌達六千四百十五元、後稍回上、計銀號對做二十兩、吿六千四百四十元、但斯時賣風復熾不支、竟退入四百元關內、計銀號沽予金號二十兩、爲六千三百七十五元、嗣又略定、升至六千四百零五元、奈小錢莊幫大量吐出、致跌勢在烈、霎時降至當日最低價六千三百十元、計錢兌業出證券幫三十兩是也、收盤錢兌業出銀號二十兩、爲六千三百二十五元、午後初開買風尙有、計證券幫進銀號二十兩、吿六千三百三十五元、不久小五元、爲六千三百二十元、而證券幫進胃甚健、提高至六千四百元、惟銀號幫等見貴又來吐塞、重落至六千三百三十元、晚收以證券幫等維持、吿六千三百三十八元、較上星期六午收軋跌一百七十四元之鉅、全日上落一百六十元、現金號之本牌金售價較烚赤的低十元、收進低四十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均解做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金亦掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、上午九點半懸六百六十元、十一點始掛小十元、午後未動、計大同行等懸六百五十元、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>金幣猛跌四元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、步趨低落、故英美金鎊一致猛降四元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票步趨低落、一度退至十七元八角、卒爲十七元八角三分、比上週六猛降三角七分、香港票供給較旺、市價疲軟、菲列濱票稍有供給、市價下落一角、日金票需耍激减、晚市退至一元六角、朝鮮票跌風米戢、晚市降爲一元一角九分、</p>
<h3>絲茶　廠線又見新價</h3>
<p>昨日紐的無市、橫濱新年後絲市、現貨一三五〇元、正月份一三五九元、六月份一三六七元、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、乾經略有交易、計怡和達昌等洋行成交金上海十三包、售價四〇五〇元、白廠絲二〇—二二七十八分售價四九〇〇元、成交五十餘包、亦爲新年後之紀錄也、</p>
<p>昨由天津來茶葉一百四十件</p>
<h3>疋頭　散戶求稅　棉布售盤下降</h3>
<p>廠布　咋市趨跌、乃因匯市寗靜、法幣價値依然不變、人心復歸平淡、散戶手貨貶價求脫、故售盤一致下降、白貨粗細布斜紋每疋跌二角半至五角、漂染布每疋亦跌三五角不等、惟一部份缺俏之貨、售盤仍形堅定、本街成交各布三百餘件、浙路甬台幫辦粗細布漂染印花各布一百餘件、閩粤幫辦漂染布斜紋等一百數十件、國外暹邏等地辦漂染布等三千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　因紗價回跌、人氣虛軟、售般直瀉、白貨龍頭細布晨開四十一元二三角、猛跌至四十元〇七角、後市一度回升至四十一元外、而仍不能站定、收盤時爲四十元〇九角、四君子嗶嘰因廠方通吿廿九年七月以前棧單限一月十五日出淸、逾期每件棧租按月須增爲十元、故有新老單之別、差價甚鉅、後市收盤新黃棧單售開一元一角六分二五、而老棧單則僅一元一角二分二五、尙乏受主、</p>
<p>出口　棉布今日有四百七十五件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>油布　生豆油背道馳　生油依然上漲</h3>
<p>昨日花生油及豆油布、互見漲跌、大勢因上週末之暴騰、亦稍有牽制、故趨勢尙無驚風駭浪、祗有一元四九角上落、豆油到頭不絕、期貨源源拋出、人心虛怯、比前市挫跌一元至一元六七角、遠期油在收盤時轉緊、結果平定、花生油產價穩定、近日銷塲尙續、故亦升一元半、統計做開膠州生油五十件、價爲九十五元半、又新貨一百件、價爲九十六元半至九十六元、烟台聽生油五百聽、價爲一百二十六七元、膠州豆油五十件、價爲八十二元半、大有廠油三百担、價爲九十五元至九十四元五角、大連豆油三百桶、價爲一百十八元至一百十九元、期貨六百桶、訂一月下交價爲一百十九元二角半至一百二十元、二月上交爲一百二十一元六角半至一百三十元云、今日有豆餅五千五百八十斤芝蔴一百六十包運香港、</p>
<h3>煤炭　木炭湧到回跌</h3>
<p>木炭行情、前因海門來貨、均由某洋行獨家包銷、由某號經理代售、致市情爲之壟斷、有漲無跌、須知價高招遠貨、近週杭嘉湖各路來貨甚多、而本市銷場有限、供過於求、行盤不支而跌、近日河溪江炭每擔喊十六元、大批尙可貼佣、故本街門莊零售、亦已較前酌减、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金菜步漲</h3>
<p>南針菜近到甚缺、據徐州函訊、產價少升十六七元之多、故申市至爲緊俏、昨高宿遷菜號盤開一百零七元、成交六十五包、行盤頂莊四一百二十元、以次自一百十元不一、</p>

<h3>工部董事選舉　英美獲廣泛同情　各國僑民一致表示傾向　公共租界現狀可望保持</h3>
<p>工部局下屆局董選舉、距今僅三月有餘、惟因日方亟欲於選舉中實現其增加日董之名額、是以競選情形、較本屆選舉時更爲劇烈，茲據探悉、工部局自始籌備進行局董選舉事宜後、關於各國外僑有選舉權者之名册、第一批業已編製竣事、惟此項名冊、爲原有選舉權之外僑名單、至於本年度有選舉權之外僑、尙在編製之中、是以本屆局董選舉、英美與日方究屬誰為多數、現尙難以確知、惟本埠其他各國外僑、如德義兩國、現尙未知其真實態度外、其餘所有法·荷·葡·挪等各國外僑、可斷言其一致傾向英美方面藉以保持公共租界之現狀、至於德義兩國商民、爲將來在滬經商計、頗多以維持公共租界現狀爲宜、</p>
<p>日僑精選　籌備已久</p>
<p>據熟悉工部局局董選日方此次對於局董競選、情緒之熱烈、實爲工部局歷决競選中所未有、由日本居留民團出全力以赴之、籌備迄今、已歷七月以上、對於日僑選票、從事分權辦法、竭力膨脹日僑選票、故此次日僑選票之多、不難想見、</p>
<p>英美合作　足相抗衡</p>
<p>至於英美聯合陣線方面、仍山英美兩國僑民委員會聯合主持、以英美兩國在公共租界之產業而言、遠出於日僑之上、但英美兩國僑民人數、殊遠遜於日僑、加之美僑陸續撤退、英僑回國報效、以目前形勢而論、勝負之數、殊未可樂觀、故英美聯合陣綫方面、尙須特別努力、允其對於其他各國西僑、促成一致的密切合作、方可與日僑抗衡、一彈爆發炸傷四人</p>
<h3>望平街附近　又有炸彈　一彈爆發炸傷四人　已拘獲嫌疑犯一名</h3>

<p>浙閩沿海航運、受日方對鎖影響、僅海口一處可以結關通航後、外輪均改航海口及福淸、頃據航業界悉、日方對於航行該處之輪船、監視亦甚嚴、有時竟派艇尾隨其後、或登輪檢査、致航行頗不自由、聞各外商輪船公司以廢曆年關將近、爲謹愼從事、年內決暫時停航、意輪馬貝里亞及英商開明輪、已先後停駛、德商禮和洋行謀福輪及魯麟洋行飛康輪、本定日內開航福淸、現亦中止啟椗、謀福輪所裝貨物、已全部卸完、兩輪均暫泊浮筒、至禮和洋行海福輪卸貨問題、日方對於德領署之交涉、仍未有答覆、各方深盼能早日解決、以免貨商航商、多受損失、</p>

<h3>沒有遺產的幸福</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>父親離開我們的時候，不曾留下一分一厘的遺產。事實上，父親沒有留下「遺債」，已經是一件僥倖的事了，我們那敢再希望他跟別人一樣有遺產留下呢？</p>
<p>父親一生是一個誠實而正直的人，因此也不曾發甚麼橫財。我相信他的每一分錢，都是用正當的方法靠自己的力量掙來的。他一生培養成羣結隊的子女，使他們都受到充足完美的敎育，使他們都能自食其力，使他們在社會上不愧是一個有用的人。收入的有限使他不能有所儲蓄，子女的衆多使他無法積聚金錢。他雖然不曾留下甚麼遺產，可是我們並不怪他，我們相信他的觀點是正確的，我們相信他已經盡了他的最大的努力，我們沒有埋怨的理由。</p>
<p>他遺留給我們的，是生活的興趣，是實用的智識，是寬大的胸懷，是靈敏的頭腦，是忠實正直的心。他遺留給我們的，是最可貴的無形的遺產，是用之不盡取之不竭的遺產，是銹不壞偷不掉的遺產。</p>
<p>父親雖然不曾留下甚麽遺產給我們，可是我們是滿足的，感激的。我們感到沒有遺產的幸福。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>外交家子貢</h3>
<p>— 白陶</p>
<p>「孔夫子」影片上，子貢的戲特別少，這眞是一個缺陷。因爲在孔子的弟子中，子貢的重要是在子路和顏回之上的。子路只不過是一個富農，顏回有些兒像沒落的貴族；只有子貢才是一個眞正的朝氣蓬勃的「士」，一個新興的商人地主。</p>
<p>孔子說：「賜不受命而貨殖焉。」貨殖就是做生意，生意做慣了，說起應酬話來就格外動聽，所以他是孔門弟子中言語科的高村生。</p>
<p>而且，生意經讀得熟了，對於「利」和「害」的辨別，就特別敏銳。春秋戰國的君主們，都是抱着「亦將有利於我國乎？」的尺度來接待說客的，所以子貢的話也就格外容易打動他們的心。</p>
<p>孔子是魯人，他的「學校」也是設在魯國的，魯國當時是個弱國，後來，齊國的權臣田常要來侵略了。</p>
<p>這個消息傳到孔子「學校」裏，孔子就對弟子們說：「夫魯，墳墓所處，父母之國；國危如此，二三子何爲莫出！」</p>
<p>話還沒說完，子路就已挺身而出了。但是孔子把他勸住了。子張子石也都自吿奮勇，孔子也都沒答應，後來子貢說願意到外面想想辦法看，孔子允許了。於是子貢請了公假，離開了他們。</p>
<p>子貢見了田常，一陣花言巧語，田常的原意動搖了。他勸田常不要伐魯而去伐吳，因爲吳是强國，戰敗了不會太丢臉，戰勝了威名立刻可以震動天下。有這樣的好處，田常當然願意遵命，但是無緣無故的改變戰略恐怕齊國的大臣要疑心，就叫子貢到吳國去一次，讓吳王自己把兵隊送上門來。</p>
<p>「夫救魯，顯名也；伐齊，大利也。」名利可以雙收，吳王當然願息採納子貢的意見。可是吳的後面有個越。越王勾踐正在那裏臥薪嘗肌要我吳王報仇雪恨呢！在這種情形之下，吳國的軍隊怎麽敢隨使調出去遠征呢？</p>
<p>於是子貢就又跑到越國去，要勾踐派兵隨吳軍去伐齊。這樣吳王就沒有後顧之憂了。</p>
<p>勾踐當時的準備沒有充實，當然不敢違抗吳王的命令。但是他幷沒有忘記前仇，便請子貢給他想法子。子貢說，「要想戰勝吳國，必須先使吳國衰弱。那麼我再到晋國去一次，讓吳王再和晋國打一仗。」</p>
<p>果然，吳王攻齊田常打敗了以後，便和晋國在黃池爭强了。這時吳國的精兵良將已經死傷得差不多了，越王涉江襲吳，就把吳國滅了把吳王殺掉。</p>
<p>子貢出來轉了這麽一個大圈子，結果「存魯亂齊，破吳，强晋而覇越。」「十年之中，五國各有變。」（史記，仲尼弟子列傳）</p>
<p>如此看來，子貢眞是一個大外交家呀！</p>
<p>也許你認爲把這插曲放在「孔夫子」影片裏幷不適宜，——這裏只有一個子貢。</p>
<p>但是有這挿曲更能顯出孔子的偉大。不僅因爲子貢的才幹是經過孔子的指點；而且我們可以看出在祖先墳墓所在地受到威脅的時候，孔子這教育家所表現的精神。</p>
<p>他並沒有說：「安份點！讀書就是救國！」同學們！在這國家多事之秋，「二三子何爲莫出？」</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>不過，他自己總不覺得有什麽可以高興的。因爲他進班子不到一個月，掌班的宋師傳就指定他學靑衣戲，並且重新替他換了一個名字，一個完全像娘兒們一樣的名字—吳玉琴。從此，他在精神上彷彿就變成了女性；頑皮的師哥們，整天圍住了他打趣，那個雙眼裏一直含着一股邪意的敎小生戲的葉先生，覻便就要摟住着他親嘴；連他兩個把兄，—老大劉玉華，學的老生；老二趙玉崑，應的是武丑，眞可稱是兩個和他意氣最相投的同學。—有時候也情不自禁的會打着戯裏的詞兒，對他「夫人」「娘子」的亂叫，雖然兩個人的心對他都是一樣的純潔。因此漸漸地使他自已也發生了一種奇怪的心理，幾乎懷疑自己眞是一個女孩子了！</p>
<p>「老三，何必這樣想家呢？哥哥待你還不好嗎？」玉華瞧他老是不作聲，便漸漸走到了他跟前來，低下了頭，把右手輕輕地按在他肩頭上，堆着一副做大哥的神氣說。</p>
<p>其實，這時候玉琴倒並不在那裏想家，他是在想六七天前最近出台的那一次的情形。</p>
<p>一那晚，他唱的是女起解，從出塲起，一直到下塲，台下的彩聲，差不多沒有停過，這還是他每次出台所常見的情形，不曾使他怎樣注意；可是這許多喝彩的人的中間，却有一條特別粗壯的嗓子，使他一聽心裏就覺得害怕起來。這倏嗓子倒眞是唱大花臉的好材料，一喊出來，便把別人的喝彩聲完全掩過了；只是聲音非常的粗野，非常的輕薄，完全像野獸在求偶期內所發出來的吼聲一樣。而且這人喊了一聲好，旁邊便有許多的人跟着他一起喊，或是劈劈拍拍的一陣瘋在的鼓掌聲，夾着片段的笑聲，彷彿那個粗嗓子就是這一羣人的領袖，大家處處都跟定着他。</p>
<p>「爹爹請上，受孩兒一拜！」當玉琴唱到蘇三拜崇公道做寄父的時候，那條粗嗓子又像悶雷似的怒吼了一聲。</p>
<p>這一回他的聲音是更響了，再加坐的位子又前，一聲在叫，差不多就在玉琴的耳朶邊喊出來；玉琴和那去解差的小丑都嚇了一跳，兩個人不由齋向那叫聲起處的听在看去。（二）</p>
<h3>修養要語（四）</h3>
<p>據青年人言，我的出路在那裏？到東不是出路，到西不是出路，於是乎十分煩悶，叫出精神苦痛的呼聲。其實到處都是出路，只要你善於發掘，善於運用，康莊大道是出路，荊棘載途，未嘗不是出路，披荊斬棘，須有勇氣，荊棘既去，同樣是坦途！</p>

<h3>小學敎師日記抄</h3>
<p>— 徐平</p>
<p>九月六日：</p>
<p>「你這爸爸有什麼用？」</p>
<p>玲在小學卒業了，這學期該升中學。</p>
<p>大多數的中學都已上課，我不敢貽誤他的前途，上星期叫他投考了××中學，已是接到了錄取的通知，限在三天之內辦理入學手續。現在計算起來，已有一個星期了，玲常催促我巷他辦理，好去上課，然而我未嘗不想如此，可是，那個東西，太不幫忙。</p>
<p>吃午飯時，玲又催促說：「你這爸爸有什麼用？」</p>
<p>玲已是十二歲的孩子了，說話有點不知輕重，他的媽媽還跟着微笑，我覺得茫然，沒話回答他，頗感難爲爸爸之憾</p>
<p>十月二十一日：</p>
<p>玲的媽媽停工</p>
<p>玲的媽媽　了紗廠已快有兩個月了，我的負担比較稍輕些，然而，生活方面頗感到不便，得自己燒飯，而且，她有日夜工，自己還得照料孩子，桌子上堆積了很高的簿子沒改</p>
<p>晚間，我燒好了飯，短針指在67之間，玲的媽媽回來了，帶着厭倦的神情，我裝飯給她吃，她吿訴我一個不祥的訊息，已被廠裏停工，因爲棉紗的銷路不好，市價暴跌，計共停了幾十個工人。我跌下了抑鬱的小溪，計算起來，她共做了一個月又二十三天，共賺了四十九元兩角。</p>
<p>十一月十日：</p>
<p>九月薪水未發</p>
<p>校長先生長久不來，每天早晨我將到校的時候，先留意門前的他的汽車，然而，總不見那個影子，換得的是失望的空虛。十一月份快去一半了，九月份的薪水還等他來發給。發了僅三十多元，有什麼用？</p>
<p>十二月六日：</p>
<p>祝壽禮劵十元</p>
<p>下半天開敎務會議，主席是敎務主任李先生。</p>
<p>他報告：「十二月十日是校長先生的四十大壽，我們該怎樣慶祝？」</p>
<p>在許多的議論下，通過了訓育主任王先生的辦法，每人敬送禮劵十元。我的心裏有些不安，加了我的心思，十元，十元，這麼大數目，在四天籌成有些不易。然而，這位是校長，比不得別人。不去的話，耳朶不　，眼睛也不瞎，總不像話。更老實的說：他有權力，你總是在他的權力控制下的小敎員哪。</p>

<h3>誌戲曲學校二傑</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>「如意社」繼葉盛章之後局</p>
<p>黃金大戲院葉盛章一局，准繼續半月，演至本月十五日打住，期滿即携隊北歸。後期新角，已的定戲曲學校畢業生劇團，—即女荀慧生李玉茹領導之「如意社」，大的十八日前後即可啟程南下，休息數日，准於廢歷兀旦登台。該社社員，除主角李玉茹，及武生王金璐，老生趙金年，小生儲金鵬，老旦李金泉，凈角趙德鈺，小丑張金樑外，共有社員八十餘人，陣容實力，較富社一局尤爲充厚。茲將李玉茹王金瑯二人之造詣，簡誌於下，以代介紹。</p>
<p>李玉茹　論劇藝者，咸持天才藝術之說，觀於戲校李玉茹演戲之成績，益可徵信也·玉茹一副面孔，能如鏡殿八面，各具聲容，七情表演，明透如畫，作劇之眞，纖毫必到。演「玉獅墜」「戰宛城」「梅龍鎭」一切花旦劇，不啻留香拓本；而靑衫唱工，允具吐珠之喉，漱玉之齒；武工刀馬，則彩鳳雙翼，無異天生。最近新排「三婦艷」「美人魚」「琥珀珠」諸劇，允有獨到，是眞文武兼全，唱作並妙，只可有一，不能有二之天才藝術家也。</p>
<p>王金璐　戲校中富於天才發展省，玉茹以外，第一當推王金璐。金璐工文武鬆生兼武生，而武生中又兼黃楊兩派，無不摹擬酷似，一時小楊小樓小黃月山之譽，同萃一身。最近復致力於紅生劇，「走麥城」「單刀會」「白馬坡」之演出，一鳴驚人。武生中之翹楚也</p>
<h3>章臺柳</h3>
<p>— 顾明道</p>
<p>（八）　不速之客</p>
<p>世間的人忠奸賢不肖，本來是要蓋棺論定的，誰也料不到後來的事。就是因爲庸凡之資，心志游移，往往到了緊要關頭，把握不住，孟子所說「嚮爲身死而不受，今爲宮室之美爲之，……又說「此之謂失其本心」。人若失去了本心，日暮途窮，倒行逆施，一切寡廉鮮恥，不忠不義的事都要做了。錢牧齋是一代文人，廊廟冡宰，不能扶危支傾，已是有負於國。假若常時聽了柳夫人的話，一死殉節，雖不能和史可法張煌言等並駕齊驅，而亦無忝臣節，留得芳名了。祇因他沒有決心，逡巡退縮，非但死不成，而又在淸兵奠定江南，徇行郡縣之時，他竟忘記了以前和柳如是說的誓言，竟被一般利祿薰心之徒，包圍左右，而和他們一同簽字在降表上，作譙周第二了。牧齋這般行爲，他的身家性命固可保全，而他的氣節墮地，一失足成千古恨，雖以長江淸流，洗濯不得的了。把一個忠貞節烈僥有丈夫氣概的柳如是氣得花容憔悴，芳心抑鬱，臥倒在床上，懨懨成病。伊爲了牧齋的失節，幾次三番和他嘔氣，然而已是沒用了，敎伊如何不要氣死呢？一病數月，萬念俱灰。在病中時候，牧新朝夕陪伴伊，親自料理湯藥，且用許多好話，殷殷勤勤地安慰伊，獻媚伊，可說衣不解帶，目不交睫，做人子的侍奉父母也不過如此了。柳如是雖然怨恨他，但見他以年逾六旬之人，而這樣勞神疲體的看護自已，心裏也有些不忍。便請牧齋好好節勞，不要過於辛苦。收齋仍是一心一意，侍奉維謹。　（二八）</p>
<h3>奮鬬的人生觀（二）</h3>
<p>奮鬬的生活，在表面上看來，再勞苦沒有，可是人生的富貴經騐，是從奮鬥中得來的，人生的價值，是從奮鬥中表現的，世界一切的文明，無一不是奮鬥中的產品，所以我當不怕奮鬥，而且要樂於奮鬥。</p>
<h3>「花木蘭」觀後</h3>
<p>— 朱庭筠</p>
<p>「花本蘭」誰都知道是代父從軍的一位女英雄，一首「喞喞復喞喞」的木蘭詞，慷慨激昂地歌動在每個人的嘴角，全劇在大體上就根劇這首詞改編而成，第一幕表演花木蘭的父親花孤，雖然已逾兵役年齡，可是奉到當局徵兵令以後，還是欣然應微，他以爲不抗戰就得向人叩頭，認賊作父，永遠屆膝下去，况且一個軍人應該馬革裹屍，光光榮榮的死在戰場上，決不能老死病床，可是終因年老力衰而給他的女兒說服，代父從戎，不過又因爲自已是一個女子的關係，不得不女扮男裝，英氣勃勃的高唱從軍歌，最可恥的就是那個貪生怕死，畏縮不前的吳成新，竟想盡種種方法預備逃避兵役，他根本不想到家園也變作戰場的時候，還能怎樣的茍安下去？第二第三幕是正義和叛逆的鬬爭。張明竟想聯合吳成新私開城門投降，甚而至於用威脅利誘的手段來對付花木蘭，使她屈服，終於却給城外飛來的一枝冷箭結束了他一生的醜史。這時主帥辛平不聽她堅守待援的主張，以城迎敵而陣亡，不得已，花木蘭便乘敵不備，領兵殺出，一不願做俘虜的人們跟我一同殺！」在鐵血的奔騰下，得到了最後的勝利。末一幕是花木蘭回到京師，金殿陛見，左僕射楊索和右僕射蘇威一塲舌戰，以主帥旣死，不奉君命，領兵殺敵應予嚴辦，和事出權宜，應加褒賞爲爭論焦點，而她却獨抱大志，以國家爲前提，辭謝兵部侍郞之職</p>
<p>演出方面，唐若靑的花木蘭，足够表演她的英武氣槪，她和花孤（石揮飾）的一塲舞劍，相當精彩。葛鑫的張明，十足表演出一副奸容。編劇方面，緊張熱烈，支配得非常均勻，就是第四幕一塲對於許多不必要的戲笑，似屬多餘。不若改爲木蘭還鄉，鄉里父老姊妹羣相出迎，祝賀她的勝利歸來，較爲妥切，不知高明以爲如何？</p>

<h3>Five Days of Bloody Battle at the Foothills of Taihang Mountain: 4,000 Japanese Soldiers All Repulsed; Chinese Troops Achieved Many Spoils in Attack on Kaocheng; Japanese Troops Attacking Eastward from Tai'an and Yanzhou Failed</h3>

<h3>Military Commission Announces One Week of Battle Situation: December 29 to January 4</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Military Commission released news stating that the battle situation in various locations over the past week (December 29 to January 4) is as follows:</p>

<h3>Wu Kaixian Broadcasts to Shanghai: "Welcoming the Year of Victory"</h3>
<p>Chongqing: (Continued from yesterday) Our advantage is the other side's disadvantage. So, judging by our domestic situation, this year is our year of victory, and that's not an overstatement. However, there's something we all have to pay attention to. As the saying goes, "a cornered beast will fight to the death." The closer the enemy gets to defeat, the more intensely they'll oppress us. Conversely, the closer we get to victory, the more pain we'll endure. The birth of a beloved child requires the mother to go through the pain of labor. How much more so when we seek victory in war? This year is precisely the year of victory, and the pain we endure will inevitably be more intense than in previous years. President Chiang saw this point, so in his New Year's Day message to the nation, he encouraged us by saying: "This year, especially, is the most arduous and significant time in our history. We must make resolute efforts with unwavering confidence. This year is truly the critical moment that will determine our rise and fall, our survival and destruction. And the power to determine the rise and fall, survival and destruction of our nation lies entirely in the hands of each of our compatriots. If we are of one mind, loyal, and active, we will not only achieve the independence and survival of our country, but also establish an enduring foundation for our entire nation. Conversely, if we are arrogant, lazy, negligent, selfish, forget the country, and harm the nation, then we will inevitably face eternal destruction and become historical sinners." The fate of the nation depends on whether we can sacrifice everything for the individual at this moment and overcome any difficulties. So, in terms of opportunity, it is fleeting. In terms of the individual's contribution to the country, it is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is precisely because of this that the topic I'm broadcasting to you today is called "Welcoming the Year of Victory." "Welcoming" expresses the meaning of welcome, but merely welcoming is not enough. We must strive to achieve it. So, how should we strive to achieve the year of victory? Of course, the people in the rear, especially the government authorities, should take more responsibility and not make excessive demands on those of you living on isolated islands. What we ask of you is that this year, you strengthen your belief in the inevitability of victory and swear to resist temptation and oppression. President Chiang said it well: "Although we cannot all have weapons, we all have ancestors and parents, we have righteousness, and we must promote the righteousness of the Chinese nation. We must have a spirit of swearing to die rather than surrender. But we must not have any minor slip-ups that would lead international observers to say that our people lack integrity." Especially young comrades, you must have character, ambition, be hardworking and frugal, and dedicate yourselves to revenge. This is speaking from a negative perspective. From a positive perspective, what we want to ask of you this year is to save more and save more. The government is already promoting the movement to save and save. Judging from the past achievements and thinking about your patriotic enthusiasm, we will certainly achieve quite satisfactory results. However, in order to welcome the year of victory, I urge you to take it a step further this year, intensify your savings, intensify your savings. Everyone, the victory of the war is this year, but we cannot wait to welcome it. We must work hard to win it. The darkness is about to pass, and the light is just ahead. All the elders and compatriots in Shanghai, I am willing to work with you to welcome the year of victory and work even harder. That's the end. (Telegraph on the 4th)</p>

<h3>Famous French Philosopher Bergson Passes Away: At the Age of Eighty-Two</h3>
<p>Vichy: Famous French philosopher Bergson recently contracted pneumonia, and despite medical treatment, he passed away yesterday in Paris at the age of eighty-two. In accordance with his will, his family will bury his remains in the Garches cemetery in Paris. Bergson was born in Paris in 1859 and obtained his doctorate at the age of nineteen. He studied philosophy in his early years and became famous in his time. In 1900, he became a professor at the Collège de France, teaching diligently and being highly welcomed by students at home and abroad. Intellectuals from various countries came to France to attend his lectures. He wrote extensively throughout his life, with the most important works including "Time and Free Will" (published in 1889), "Matter and Memory" (published in 1897), "Laughter" (published in 1900), "Creative Evolution" (published in 1906), "Mind-Energy" (published in 1920), and "Duration and Simultaneity" (published in 1922), all of which were popular for a time. His last work was "The Two Sources of Morality and Religion," published in 1934. Bergson was elected a member of the Académie française in 1914 and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1928. Modern French thought was greatly influenced by Bergson's theories. However, he brought his career as a professor to an end at the age of fifty-two (1911) and retired to the town of Torcy near Paris in 1921 to live out his remaining years. He had previously lectured at Columbia University in the United States and met many American scholars. The famous American philosopher James was one of his close friends. Bergson's main theory was the so-called "philosophy of life," which was also popular in China more than a decade ago. (Havas Agency Telegraph on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Punishing Rice Weevils and Protecting the People's Food</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Criminal Court of the Shanghai First Special District Court sentenced a Mr. Zhang to ten months in prison for selling rice above the price limit. Public sentiment was stirred, and it became a topic of discussion everywhere. Some clapped and cheered, while others shook their heads and sighed. Those who cheered felt that the exorbitant rice prices of the past two years had directly caused famine and indirectly made the overall life experience severely impacted, all due to unscrupulous profiteers who violated national laws, disregarded social welfare, enriched themselves at the expense of others, and lived carefree lives. Everyone who eats rice hated them with gnashing teeth but had no way to seek redress. Now, these profiteers have finally been punished with shaved heads, red clothing, and imprisonment. The cheering was a way to vent their resentment. Those who sighed felt that the high rice prices were actually due to the violent control in the producing areas, and that the reason these profiteers acted unscrupulously was simply because they lacked education and reason. They happened to be in a time when law and morality had lost their governing power. They only focused on profiting and had no idea that it was a crime. Even regarding the crime, respectable merchants in the rice industry had repeatedly stated in a very respectable manner that the industry was uneven, with some bad elements. However, they did not consider that the high rice prices indicated that the rice industry was actually controlled by these bad elements. The manipulators were like this, and those who made fortunes were like that, but now only Mr. Zhang is being sentenced to ten months. How can one not sigh for this? But in Mr. Zhang's case, the punishment is deserved, and imprisonment is not enough to cover his guilt. No one should sympathize with Mr. Zhang simply because the majority of major profiteers are escaping the law.</p>
<p>Shanghai is truly a "special zone," a special zone of China, an international special zone, and a world special zone! Since the outbreak of the European war, many new and realistic examples and lessons have been placed before the people of Shanghai. In the countries at war, the daily necessities of the people were either cut off or reduced in production. Therefore, the authorities made overall plans and managed them. There were strict regulations regarding the quality, quantity, and selling price of each item, and even prohibitions on import, circulation, and consumption. However, Shanghai, where all kinds of goods are displayed as usual, free trade is as usual, and the selling price of daily necessities is dozens of times higher than usual, like the special zone of Shanghai today, is truly unique. However, the people of Shanghai often forget that this is "wartime" and that this is a "special zone." Apart from the limitations of the legal tender in their hands, they often do not know to restrain themselves. If they feel unfair, dissatisfied, or unfulfilled, they often explain it as the Chinese government's functions being inferior to those of the countries in the European war. For example, when they see rice merchants making huge profits while ordinary people struggle to eat, some people who seem to understand major world affairs sigh, "Other countries would never allow bakeries to make war fortunes!" In reality, only Shanghai, until yesterday, invoked wartime laws to punish criminals.</p>
<p>The National Government promulgated the "Regulations for Determining Prices and Suppressing Speculation and Manipulation in Times of Emergency" as early as February of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). In December of the same year, it also promulgated the "Regulations for Purchasing and Selling Daily Necessities at Fair Prices" and the "Regulations for Suppressing the Hoarding of Daily Necessities." The "Regulations for Determining Prices and Suppressing Speculation and Manipulation in Times of Emergency" consisted of fifteen articles, stipulating that local areas should establish fair price committees. There were three fair standards for determining the prices of daily necessities. The production and sales of factories and businesses, as well as the supply and demand in the market, must be based on investigations. Goods could be forcibly sold according to legal procedures and formalities. Profiteers could be reported according to law and await sanctions. These articles were almost equivalent to empty words in Shanghai. Although there are more than one reason why laws cannot be fully implemented in Shanghai, and the high prices in Shanghai have other reasons besides the failure of laws, the habit of Shanghai officials and civilians to indulge and disregard laws cannot be denied. This has led to general difficulties in life and hidden social crises. It can be said that at least a part of it is a consequence of their own actions. I believe that before yesterday, there must have been countless Mr. Zhangs who went to prison. After the profiteers have been fully dealt with according to the law, it will definitely be able to curb the rampant market to a considerable extent.</p>
<p>Punishing one to warn a hundred is certainly necessary. Public opinion also hopes that the Shanghai authorities will enforce the law and continue to conduct larger-scale investigations and more severe punishments. However, the threat to Shanghai's public order and residents' lives from rice prices and other prices will not be immediately reduced or eliminated by punishing profiteers. Not only will it not be reduced or eliminated, but it may even face an even more serious threat in another way due to the initial unsound understanding of various aspects, followed by unsound methods. Take the rice price problem as an example: it is widely rumored in the market that respectable rice merchants have already reduced their business, firstly because they are unwilling to associate with the unscrupulous, secondly because they are worried about illegal coveting, and thirdly because they fear bearing the bad reputation of profiteers. It is also rumored that the source of food for the people depends entirely on the rice merchants' transportation and maintenance. If the rice merchants face the danger of losing money and suffer unjust grievances, coupled with strict investigations and punishments, they will inevitably stop moving forward. Then who will supply the people's food? All these kinds of rumors are very similar and pleasing to the ear. Therefore, experienced and prudent people warn each other not to be rash. Because no one dared to be rash, it has continued for two or three years. Taking advantage of this inertia, several generations of respectable people have leisurely bought and sold, making profits of millions and tens of millions. Fearing to break the vase when trying to catch the rat, the rats jumped around. The best policy for now is to clear the channels of supply, but the power to give and take life is in the hands of others. Holding fair price sales is certainly charitable, but those who eat fair price rice must sell rice every day. It is not possible to have fair price sales that are intermittent. And most citizens do not want to take advantage of charity but want to support themselves. Therefore, it is better to start with financial accommodation and promote the method of group rice purchases. If the group method can become widespread, then threats will have no source to wreak havoc, and then there will be respectable rice merchants who only take small profits.</p>
<h3>US President Asks Congress for Authorization to Help Britain in the War. Public Concerned About Content of Draft Message. Media Urges Maximum Supply of Military Needs</h3>
<p>Washington - Official sources here revealed last night that President Roosevelt plans to ask Congress today for a blank check to handle the tens of billions of dollars in aid to Britain's lease program. The 30,000-word message was drafted by the President last night, and the entire country is waiting for the announcement and hoping for it very much. Since President Wilson's message in 1917 requesting a declaration of war against Germany, this is the message from the President that has received the most earnest concern from the people. Close friends of the President predict that the amount of aid to Britain will far exceed previous expectations. Roosevelt will ask for assistance for this program, and the final cost may reach 170 billion US dollars. After today's message is announced, it will be supplemented by the annual budget message on Wednesday. According to authoritative sources, the budget message will request billions of dollars for national defense and emergency relief, and will also request hundreds of millions of dollars for other non-defense activities. According to authoritative sources, the budget message will also request tax increases. (6th International News Agency)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt has recently been formulating a plan to continue and expand aid to Britain, and is preparing to submit it to Congress. Many believe that this proposal from the President will be passed by Congress. Even isolationists privately admit that they have no power to dismiss the President's plan. (6th United Press Agency)</p>
<p>New York - Last night, people across the United States were closely awaiting the speech to be delivered by President Roosevelt in Congress today. Coupled with the good news from Britain in Cirenaica and the departure of Roosevelt's special envoy Hopkins to London, the public's emotions were even higher. According to Kintner, who is close to New Deal figures, President Roosevelt is currently drafting multiple plans to accelerate military production to meet Britain's needs. According to well-informed journalists, President Roosevelt's proposed plans include (1) using the automobile industry to manufacture aircraft, (2) transferring American ships or other ships docked in American ports to Britain, and (3) transporting American army aircraft to Britain. The Washington Post published an editorial stating that after President Roosevelt delivers his speech in Congress, he will be able to make the current policy of the United States clear to the world. (6th Huitong News Agency)</p>
<p>New York - The New York Herald Tribune and the New York Times both published special articles yesterday, advocating that the United States should provide full assistance to Britain. The New York Herald Tribune stated that Hitler would not recognize American aid to Britain as an act of war until Britain was defeated. Therefore, while Britain is still resisting, the United States may as well provide Britain with all the assistance it can. The New York Times published an article by Harvard Law Professor Lezhe, which was long and covered two columns, stating that the United States is already in a state of war with the Axis powers. The technical state of peace is only an illusion and an obstacle to providing substantial aid to Britain. In fact, only full assistance to Britain can save the United States from a real war. The minimum extent of aid to Britain should include confiscating Axis ships in the United States, prohibiting Axis consulate personnel in the United States, and having American warships escort supplies to Britain. A military expert from the New York Herald Tribune, Major Li Ou, also argued that the United States should sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers and protect Southern Ireland and use Southern Irish ports, pointing out that this is a way to promote the policy of escorting supplies to Britain.

<h3>Newspaper Discusses US-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Continued Sales News today reported that the United States is currently trying its best to promote trade between the United States and the Soviet Union, planning to supply the Soviet Union with oil and machinery in an attempt to make the Soviet Union lean towards the British and American side. The United States' move is due to the dangerous situation in the Pacific, and it must both carry out the policy of aiding Britain and protect its position in the Pacific. On the Soviet side, this kind of trade progress is also welcomed. The European market is now completely closed except for Germany, and trade with Britain is also completely uncertain. Trade with Japan has also been suspended. However, according to the Des Investigation Committee of Non-American Activities in the United States, Soviet financial institutions in the United States are now actively purchasing heavy war goods to help the Axis powers. In addition, according to British Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton, American raw cotton, rubber, and scrap iron are now being shipped from Vladivostok to Germany, which may cause opposition to the friendly relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Soviet Union Promotes Air Transport</h3>

<h3>British Blockade of Germany Achieves Remarkable Results. Newspaper Says Counter-Blockade Has Affected the Far East</h3>
<p>London - The Times published an interview with Minister of Economic Warfare Dalton, saying that the blockade has been very effective, and I still want the blockade to be even tighter. Germany still has important supply routes, the most important of which is through the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union purchases large quantities of cotton from North America and South America, and imports rubber and some metals from the Far East. Germany gets some profit from this, although the quantity is small, the value is high. When asked about the saying that Spain is a loophole in the blockade, Dalton replied that I know a slightly ungenerous treatment will fall into Hitler's plan and exploit Spain's independence, but it is not necessarily that important goods are transferred into the German army. Dalton also said that the food in the German-occupied area is quite abundant, which can make the residents not starve. If the German side can find a way to transport more food into its occupied area, then Germany will transfer workers who produce food to engage in the manufacture of armaments. If so, then Germany's manpower will be greatly enhanced. We should not expect Germany's economy to collapse soon. Germany has a lot of reserves and has the ability to deal with temporary situations. Germany's distribution difficulties will occur earlier than production difficulties, because the transport in Europe under German occupation is chaotic and disordered. Italy has been hit more directly, and the ineffectiveness of its air force and the inactivity of its navy are probably due to insufficient gasoline. (6th Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to "Yomiuri Shimbun", Germany's counter-blockade measures are becoming increasingly effective. German warships have sunk ten enemy ships in the Pacific, and the Far East is also filled with the smell of gunpowder. (6th Huitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>On the Eve of the Japanese Parliament Meeting, Domestic Conflicts Intensify. Political, Economic, and Diplomatic Issues All Feel Thorny.</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The New Year's holiday has passed, and the newspapers in Tokyo are paying attention to the domestic political situation, as the political activities will reach their peak after the parliament meeting on the 21st of this month. Among the major problems that the government must deal with now, the implementation of the principles of the new national politics and economy is the most thorny. Although this principle has been passed by the cabinet, it has not yet been implemented. There are many different opinions on how the new economic structure should be constructed, especially the conflicts between the Planning Agency, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the commercial, industrial, and financial sectors. In addition, because the state of Japan's diplomatic relations is becoming increasingly complicated, how the political position of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association should be regulated is also a matter of great concern to the general public. It is heard that the new Home Minister Hiranuma intends that the Association should focus on spiritual efforts to consolidate the hearts of the people throughout the country, while other parties advocate giving the Association a clearer scope of activities and enhancing its political activities. At the same time, it is heard that the Parliamentary Members' Club is also actively engaged in activities. According to reports, since the government announced the new national political structure, the political parties have been dissolved. Now, only the Club serves as the organ of the parliament. Some members advocate still dividing according to the old political parties, while others are already discussing plans to organize political parties. This kind of movement is just beginning. It is heard that the government, because it violates the principles of the new domestic order, has decided to curb it as early as possible to prevent it from growing. However, the right to organize political parties is enshrined in the constitution, and the government can only use moral persuasion to curb the development of this kind of movement. The fact that the Japanese political situation is eventful can also be seen. (6th Reuters News Agency)</p>

<h3>London Fire Watchers: Remarkable Success in Air Defense; German Incendiary Bombs Quickly Extinguished; British Aircraft Fly to France, Sinking Multiple German Ships</h3>
<p>London: From last night until dawn today, three squadrons of German aircraft dropped hundreds of incendiary bombs on a certain district of London. However, the newly organized civilian fire brigades quickly extinguished the fires. These civilian firefighters, after extinguishing the hundreds of incendiary bombs dropped by the first two squadrons of aircraft, were all delighted and shouted, "Why not drop some more? We don't have enough and want more practice!" The group of German aircraft from the third squadron, because the fires were quickly extinguished, dropped even more, intending to burn the entire district to the ground at once. It is also reported that the raiders also went to Liverpool, a town in the eastern Midlands, a town in the northwest, and a town in northeastern England. In the areas the German aircraft passed over, the town in the northwest fired artillery for a short time as the German aircraft passed, and a loud explosion was heard from afar in the town in northeastern England. Since December 21st, London has had its first all-clear alarm. The alarm was triggered by two German reconnaissance planes flying over the Thames River. Another all-clear alarm occurred when an air raider suddenly flew low over a residential area of a town in Anton-Gree at an altitude of 2,000 feet and dropped sixteen high-explosive bombs. When the defending soldiers saw the aircraft arrive, they all fired machine guns into the sky to try to drive it away. The German aircraft's bombs landed on a hill, a football field, a school, and a sports field in the town, but there were no casualties. The raider then intensified its attack in another location in the town. Before the aircraft was driven away, the roofs of many houses had been damaged. At 6:35 pm yesterday, a town in South Wales also spotted German aircraft. At 7 pm, London issued a night raid alert. After a while, German aircraft were seen and artillery fire was heard. London had several hours of quiet last night. At 10 pm, German aircraft returned to drop bombs, and anti-aircraft guns fired again. A town in the northern Midlands also heard bomber aircraft flying over. The all-clear alarm was lifted in the London area at 11:30 pm, after German aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs on a residential area, damaging many houses. Four civilians were injured and taken to the hospital. Rescue teams searched everywhere for more civilians who might have been buried in the rubble, hoping to rescue them. In another district, three high-explosive bombs fell, damaging several houses, with no casualties. Multiple German aircraft were seen over southeastern England, flying very low despite intense anti-aircraft fire. They then flew inland, and explosions were heard shortly after. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, German aircraft dropped many large landmines in England using parachutes. This is the first time this news has been revealed because the authorities have banned its publication when examining the news. This news was broadcast by the famous lawyer, Harry Law, it is said. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: Aircraft from the British Coastal Defense Command bombed the port of Brest in France on Saturday evening. Three bombs directly hit a German destroyer and all exploded. One of them hit the stern of the ship, and the ship was enveloped in smoke and fire, and its anti-aircraft guns could no longer fire. British aircraft also hit two German merchant ships off the southwestern coast of Norway and bombed Hamburg, Germany. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: The British Air Ministry announced last night that the Royal Air Force carried out extensive bombing of Hamburg and Brest on Saturday night. In addition, the sinking of a German destroyer and two merchant ships should also be credited to the Royal Air Force. The results of the air raids on Hamburg and Brest have caused serious damage to the construction work of port facilities, it is said. (International News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: During the German air raid on London last night, the fire watchers achieved remarkable results. Three waves of enemy aircraft attacked, dropping hundreds of incendiary bombs on a certain district. However, the watchers immediately reported the situation and quickly initiated rescue efforts, so the incendiary bombs were extinguished before they could spread. Liverpool, a town in the eastern Midlands, and a town in northwestern England all had German aircraft appearing in the sky yesterday. A German aircraft attacked East Anglia during the day, dropping several bombs, causing slight material damage and injuring several people. There were also reports of German single-engine aircraft strafing elsewhere. One German aircraft dived down and fired on a herd of cattle in a field. The cattle were startled and scattered, but were not injured. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>London: London was subjected to another fierce air raid last night. The German offensive was sometimes strong and sometimes weak. The alert was not lifted until nearly midnight. During the air raid, high-explosive bombs fell like powder amidst the furious sound of anti-aircraft guns. All districts of London were damaged, destroying many houses and killing many people. Incendiary bombs caused many fires. Male and female citizens assisted volunteer teams and firefighters in their efforts to extinguish the fires. By this morning, London had survived a calamity. During this air raid, hundreds of London citizens formed fire watch teams, stationed in hundreds of locations to prevent a repeat of the fire blitzkrieg of a week ago. Many incendiary bombs were extinguished as soon as they landed by these watch team members. The authorities greatly praised the high efficiency of their work. Many other places outside London were attacked at the same time. Liverpool and other central areas in the Midlands, as well as the northwest and northeast of England, were also subjected to scattered bombing. (International News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German military reports state that the British southwestern ports in the Brest Strait have now replaced the ports at the mouth of the Thames River in the past few months, and the German Air Force has also subjected them to intense bombing in the past few nights.

The damage to German targets by British aircraft was very minor, it is said. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Belgrade: As rumors are spreading here that the Germans are preparing to peacefully occupy Bulgaria, there is news today of a meeting of Soviet envoys to the Balkan countries in Moscow.

As for the external form of Bulgaria allowing German occupation, it is said that it will depend on the discussions between the Bulgarian Prime Minister and the German Foreign Minister. Sources with the best information believe that Yugoslavia's position will also become an unpleasant bystander. If German troops quickly enter Bulgaria, the result could be to cut off the connection between Turkey and Greece and force the fall of Salonika.

<h3>Greek Soldiers in Albania Advance Towards the Coastal Area; Important Base of Italian Forces in Central Albania, Elbasan, Threatened on Three Sides</h3>
<p>Athens: The Greek High Command announced this morning that Greek forces advanced further towards the Albanian coastal area last night. Italian forces were driven back and retreated closer to Valona. Other Greek forces captured 200 Italian soldiers and occupied several strategically important high grounds between Valona and Kätibi-rini. A communiqué from the Greek High Command stated that Greek forces pressing towards Elbasan in the northeastern theater repelled a fierce counterattack by the Italian side and safely maintained Saturday's victory. The Italian forces are trying to improve their position, but are failing on all fronts. There was artillery fire northeast of Pogradec, and a major battle is brewing in that area. It is reported that a large force of German troops is planning to rescue Elbasan. It is also reported that British aircraft heavily damaged Elbasan yesterday, and fires broke out in many military targets in the city. Countless columns of Italian troops were also bombed. (International News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Athens: According to reliable news from the front, Elbasan, the most important base of the Italian side in central Albania, is now threatened from the east and southwest due to the recent victories of the Greek forces. It is heard that the Italian side is rushing to build fortifications in the hope of stopping the Greek forces from advancing. The remaining elite troops of Italy are now being deployed from Dyrrhachium to guard the road leading to Elbasan. The left flank of the Italian army is still not far from Pogradec. The weather is cold and windy, and frostbite is a concern, so rapid advancement of the troops is impossible. Although the Greek forces face extreme difficulties, morale remains high. There is an urgent need for a larger supply of suitable boots and clothing. Several points on the front line are far from places accessible by trucks or mules, so heavy artillery must be dragged by manpower. At the same time, British bombers continue to attack the town of Elbasan, causing fires in many places with bombs, and many defenses have been hit. Athenian newspapers say that Italian soldiers are not incapable of fighting, but they do not want to sacrifice their lives in the current war, so those captured by Greek forces often sing to each other. Italian officers who enlisted before the fall of France are greatly dismayed by the continued defeat of the Italian army, believing that the defeat and national humiliation are caused by fascism.

An official spokesperson stated that Italian forces are still constantly sending reinforcements to the front lines and using the help of the weather to try to stop the advance of Greek forces. The spokesperson said, "All Italian offensive attempts have failed and suffered significant losses." (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Under a Three-Pronged Attack by Land, Sea, and Air, British Forces Occupy Bardia, Italian Commander General Bergonzoli Captured, Invading Forces in Egypt No Longer Exist</h3>
<p>(Cairo) Bardia, the strong stronghold of the Italian army in Libya, is now in the hands of the British army. A unit of the Free French Marine Corps, while patrolling west of the position still held by the Italian army yesterday, cut off the main road between Bardia and Tobruk in one fell swoop, causing the Italian army besieged in Bardia to have no way to escape and was forced to surrender. According to the British Army Headquarters communiqué, the British army has so far captured 20,000 enemy troops, including the Italian commander General Bergonzoli, and seized or destroyed more than 45 light tanks and 5 medium tanks. As soon as the Italian army surrendered, the Italian flag hanging in the Bardia City Hall was removed and all resistance ceased. At this point, the complete cooperation of the British infantry, navy, and air force had broken through the iron ring defense line of this strong Italian stronghold within 36 hours. According to a military spokesman, the capture of Bardia will greatly alleviate the problem of maintaining British military supplies, as British supplies will no longer have to travel a long distance by land from Mersa Matruh. The port of Sollum, which was under the artillery fire of the Italian army in Bardia a few days ago, will also be of greater use. Moreover, the water source in Bardia is better than that obtained in Mersa Matruh, Sidi Barrani, Buqbuq, or Sollum. The British army estimates that Bardia (the first city to fall to the Italians) will deal another major blow to Italian prestige, and the capture of 20,000 enemy troops shows that the invading forces in Egypt led by Italian General Graziani no longer exist. In fact, the invading Italian army in Egypt was resolved by the British army in less than a month after the British took the offensive. Ansaldo, the editor of the newspaper run by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, had prepared for the fall of Bardia in his weekly broadcast to the Italian army. According to the German News Agency, Ansaldo was quoted as saying that no matter what the fate of Bardia is or when it falls, the brave record of its garrison should be thanked by all Italians. General Bergonzoli guarded Bardia for 20 days, which is the glory of Italy, because Bardia is not a fortress, only trenches were built. The Italian army was able to hold the city by virtue of its courage. The achievements of the garrison are well known, that is, preventing the British offensive and giving the Italian army in Libya time to deploy defenses.</p>
<p>Bardia Italian Army Surrenders Before Last British Attack</p>
<p>Reuters special correspondent cabled from the British Army Headquarters in the western desert, describing the last British offensive before the Italian army surrendered, saying that the Australian army, with the help of British armored vehicles, rushed through Bardia like a fast train, and successfully implemented the commander's plan. The attack time and each stage were all formulated by the British advanced headquarters near the Cyrenaica border according to the latest situation, and all proceeded smoothly in order, and the results were in line with the most optimistic hopes. In the past two weeks, artillery, ammunition, drinking water, and gasoline have been transported to the front line in an endless stream. The British navy and air force bombed Bardia fiercely for two nights and one day, so that the army could attack at dawn on January 3. At dawn, the Australian army, assisted by tanks, stormed the western side of the Bardia defense zone, then expanded to the southeast, and attacked the Bardia garrison from the rear and flanks. After a day and a half, the Italian army in the southern half of the defense zone had been cleared. Only a few guards were still hiding in the rugged mountains in the extreme southeast corner. The speed of the war was surprising. What was even more surprising was that the Italian army in the northern half of the defense zone was also cleared at the same time. The Watin Quffin deep valley, which runs across the circular defense zone west of Bardia, became a natural barrier against tanks, but the Australian army's advance was not hindered, and it soon rushed through the valley. The Australian army fought bravely and made rapid progress, but it was heard that the Australian army's casualties were not heavy. In addition to capturing the enemy, the British army has now obtained all the artillery, supplies, and ammunition that defended Bardia. Bardia is the main forward base of the Italian army on the border between Egypt and Libya, so when it is checked in the future, other supplies stored there may be found in the thousands. The problem of disposing of the captured prisoners has now been easier to solve, because an agency has been organized behind the front line to quickly process the prisoners. Most of the Italian army is willing to be captured, so the prisoner problem has become simpler. The garrison in northern Bardia is believed to include some Italian soldiers who retreated from the Capuzzo battery and Sidi Barrani. It is said that these Italian soldiers were extremely discouraged and had no fighting spirit after being surrounded by the British army. (Reuters telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Bardia Frontline) The Australian army completely occupied Bardia yesterday after breaking through the strong resistance of the Italian army. The siege war since the 18th has thus been successful. The Australian soldiers first cleared the Italian army's defenses south of Bardia on Saturday, and then concentrated on a large-scale offensive from the sea, land, and air. The sound of artillery fire was deafening, and could be heard fifty miles away. The Australian assault team also attacked the Italian stone bunkers scattered around Bardia at this time. The general attack of the tank team began at 5:30 am on Friday in the faint light of the east. At the sound of the order, thousands of vehicles galloped, and smoke and dust rose in the desert. The density of the heavy artillery and bombs was so great that the besieged city would be reduced to dust, and the sound was deafening, drowning out the rumble of the tanks. On this morning, the sun rose slowly, and the sky was clear, while in the city of Bardia, two large fires and several small fires broke out one after another. The city of Bardia, which had been bombarded for several weeks, can be said to have been completely destroyed. Except for two or three buildings still standing in the artillery area, nothing else remains. Some of the houses have become solid powder. This general attack by the British army with tanks as the vanguard was a carefully planned plan. The arrival of the Australian soldiers at the front to carry out their first decisive battle was also very secret. Its infantry and artillery forces have been fighting for many days and have suffered considerable casualties. As a result, the final blow to the life of the port of Bardia was delivered by the British Navy. The British fleet fired on the city in unison at 8:00 am, supplemented by the bombing of the air force and the army, so that no living creatures could be left in the city.

<p>Churchill Congratulates Australian Prime Minister, Britain Will Continue to Attack Tobruk</p>
<p>(London) Bardia has now been captured. Before receiving the news of the Allied army capturing Bardia, British Prime Minister Churchill sent a telegram to the Australian Prime Minister congratulating the Australian army on its victory in the first attack on Bardia, saying that the Australian army's breakthrough of the western line of defense and the capture of at least 5,000 people is a great military achievement and will be the prelude to greater victories in the future. (Reuters telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Cairo) The British Army Headquarters announced that the Italian army, which had vowed to "defend to the death and perish with the city" while holding Bardia, finally ended its resistance at 1:30 pm on the 5th. (United News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Officials announced that all resistance from the Italian army in Bardia, an important Italian town in Libya, ended at 1:00 pm on the 5th. Military observers believe that the British army has obtained a new base from which to continue its attack. At the same time, a large number of British Empire troops, who were previously used to besiege Bardia, can now be used to capture Tobruk in the next step. Because of the strong resistance of the Italian army in Bardia, it is now believed that most of the Italian North African army has been wiped out or captured, and the British army's operations will be more convenient for the supply of water. (United News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters telegram from a special correspondent with the British army in Bardia, I climbed to the top of an earthen mound and witnessed several British tanks in the vicinity leading the way with gunfire, followed by Australian infantry holding guns and slowly advancing. The Italian army, afraid of the fierce bombing in recent days, quickly surrendered. After the artillery fire suddenly stopped, an odd silence suddenly occurred on the battlefield. I then drove into the city of Bardia and saw thousands of captured Italian soldiers along the way, all looking tired.

<p>(Rome) Rome Radio admitted this morning the fall of Bardia, but warned that the British will never be able to reach the cultivated plateau of Libya. Rome Radio said, "This decisive attack by the British has no military reason, but they think that if they give the Italian army a powerful blow, the internal front line of Italy will collapse, but Italian morale will be strengthened as a result. What the British have gained is only a moment of respite. The real purpose of the British army's attack has already failed. (International News Agency telegram on the 6th)</p>

<h3>British Government Decides to Establish a Wartime Production Committee, House of Commons to Hold Closed-Door Debate on Production and Manpower Issues at Meeting</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters correspondent stationed in the House of Commons lounge claimed that a wartime production executive committee composed of Navy Secretary Alexander, Aircraft Production Minister Beaverbrook, Labor Minister Bevin, and Supply Minister Duncan will be established. This matter has been decided by the government. As a further measure to deal with wartime production issues, it is said that Bevin will serve as the chairman of the committee, but another group of people supports Beaverbrook for this position. Greenwood, the Minister without Portfolio who has been serving as the chairman of the Production Committee, will remain in the War Cabinet, but from now on, he will focus on post-war construction issues, because he served in the Construction Department during the last Great War and has rich experience in this area. In addition, there is another agency to be established to deal with the import side. It is expected that an executive committee will soon be established to deal with this overall problem, and Supply Minister Duncan will be its chairman. A large official announcement will be issued this week. When the House of Commons reconvenes, a closed-door debate may be held on production and manpower issues. (Reuters telegram on the 6th)</p>

<h3>Work at the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica: Manufacturing Wireless Radio Sets and Measuring Geomagnetism</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) The site of the Institute of Physics of the National Academia Sinica was originally in Shanghai. Since the August 13th Incident, most of the instruments and books have been moved to other places for preservation. The Zijinshan Geomagnetic Observatory and other research institutes were evacuated to Changsha and transferred to Sanjiang, Guilin. The geomagnetism research section was moved to Kunming. In recent years, although the institute's instrument factory has been moved out of the Polytechnic Experimental Hall, its work has not stopped. The work of each department is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The work that has been carried out in the Guilin wireless radio section includes the installation of wireless radio sets, the manufacture of vibrator rectifiers, the modification of hand-cranked generators, and the modification of crystal filter heterodyne receivers, all of which have been effective. The projects that are currently underway include the design and construction of a wireless communication network for the entire province of Guangxi, the trial manufacture of dry batteries and electrolytic capacitors, and the installation of ultra-shortwave wireless transceivers, which have been of great assistance to all parties. Other projects planned to be carried out, such as the trial assembly of amplifiers for long-distance telephones, the establishment of wireless direction finding, the installation of wireless prospecting equipment, and the exploration of the ionosphere at high altitudes, are all important for both practical use and research.</p>
<p>(2) In terms of geomagnetism work research in Guilin, (1) the institute has self-made new instruments for measuring V and measuring N, which will continue to complete the unfinished experimental calibration work, and will soon organize the results and prepare a report. (2) The institute is cooperating with the Land Survey Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters to plan a large-scale measurement of geomagnetism throughout the country and to establish a geomagnetic network. (3) Geomagnetic surveys throughout Guangxi Province will use the existing triangulation points of the land survey and the known azimuths to complete the measurement of geomagnetic elements in various places in the near future. (4) The construction of the Yanshan Geomagnetic Observatory was suspended due to material and transportation difficulties, and is now being planned to continue.</p>
<p>(3) The research work in Kunming that is currently in progress includes (A) the surface magnetism of polycrystalline materials such as iron and nickel, and (B) the relationship between various heat treatments and magnetic chains of magnetic steel and its permanent magnetism. In addition, the institute, based on practical needs and international geomagnetic record cooperation, is also building a geomagnetic observatory near the observatory of the Astronomical Institute on Phoenix Mountain in the east of the city for research and experimentation.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial College of Education Holds Make-Up Opening Ceremony, Will Add Specialized Courses Next Academic Year</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial College of Education was ordered to move back to northern Jiangsu, and the part left in Guilin was changed to a branch. It started classes in Dafeng Reclamation Area on October 10. On November 20, it was ordered to move to Xinghua, and more than 60 students were registered. The freshman orientation training has been completed. On December 29, at 10:00 am, a make-up opening ceremony for the relocation of the college was held. In the past three years, there have been many high school graduates from Jiangsu Province who have no place to go for further studies. Since the College of Education opened, they have been requesting relief. The college has two departments, social education and agricultural education, but is limited in the number of students it can admit. It is heard that in order to meet the needs, it has been decided to add specialized courses in literature, history, geography, mathematics, physics, and chemistry this year, and to start with specialized courses in literature, history, and geography in the first half of the year. It is heard that enrollment will begin during the winter vacation.</p>
<h3>Teachers and Staff of Sanyu Primary and Secondary School Go on Strike Yesterday, Requesting the School to Increase Salaries</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) A partial strike occurred among teachers and staff at Sanyu Primary and Secondary School, No. 15, Lane 920, Xinzha Road, yesterday morning (the 6th), requesting the school to increase salaries and sending letters to parents of students explaining the reasons for the strike and requesting sympathy and assistance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Strike</p>
<p>There are more than 40 teachers and staff in the school. About 27 people are participating in this strike. Currently, some classes in the school are still continuing. The conditions requested by the teachers and staff from the school are: (1) Starting next semester, the salary for each semester will be calculated for six months (currently, the school calculates the salary for teachers and staff for five months each semester), (2) Starting next semester, salaries will be increased by 50%, (3) An additional month's salary will be issued at the end of the year. According to the school authorities, the teachers and staff suggested to the school that, starting next semester, the tuition fees for students at all levels should be increased by 30%, and the increased amount should be distributed to the teachers and staff to improve their lives. The school believes that the lives of the teachers are indeed very difficult, and salaries should be increased, but it seems unreasonable to increase the burden on students by a large amount due to the increase in the salaries of teachers and staff. Because the tuition fee for the primary school department is 12 to 16 yuan, 20 yuan for the senior primary school, 33 yuan for the junior high school, and 38 yuan for the senior high school. If it is increased by 30% again, each student will have to increase the tuition fee by about 9 yuan per semester. The school then decided on a compromise solution, increasing the tuition fee by 4 yuan for primary and secondary schools, and the principal also promised to provide 500 yuan to be distributed to the teachers and staff at the end of the lunar year, but the teachers and staff felt that it was not satisfactory, which led to the strike.</p>
<p>Letter to Parents</p>
<p>The letter from the teachers and staff of the school to the parents of students said: Dear Sir/Madam, the undersigned, due to soaring prices and living standards being several times higher, sent a letter to the principal in February and March of last year requesting an increase in salaries, which was not approved. By the time school started this semester, the tuition and miscellaneous fees for students had been increased, but the salaries of teachers had not been increased by a single penny. When school starts next semester, the tuition and miscellaneous fees for students have already been internally determined to increase. The undersigned made a second request on December 21 of last year. As of recently, the school authorities have not responded sincerely. The undersigned are forced by life to temporarily suspend classes and wait for a reasonable solution. Please understand our plight and ask for your sympathy and assistance from the parents and people in society. We would be very grateful. We hereby respectfully request your perusal. Respectfully yours, Teachers and Staff of Sanyu Primary and Secondary School, January 6, 1942.</p>

<h3>Xuelian Cup Table Tennis Tournament Successfully Completed, Fudan University Wins Championship, Defeats Shanghai Provincial High School No. 1 by Five to Two in the Finals</h3>
<p>The Xuelian Cup All-Shanghai University and Middle School Team Table Tennis Championship had 16 participating schools. After the round-robin matches, Fudan University and Shanghai Provincial High School No. 1 each won the right to the finals with a record of 14 wins and 1 loss. The championship match was held at 2:00 pm on the 5th (the day before yesterday) at the Xindu Ballroom. More than 600 guests attended. Yuan Ludeng delivered a speech first, followed by reports from Zhuang Yongji, speeches from Chen Linsheng, Gu Zhongyi, and Ge Futian, and then the opening ceremony was held by Lu Wenying. The competition started amidst the silver horn sounds of referees Chen Linsheng and Li Suishen. In the first group, Yu Lingxiao, a good defensive player from Fudan, played against Liu Fu, a new general from Shanghai Provincial High School No. 1. Yu lost by one to three, which was unexpected by the audience. Fudan had an unfavorable start, but the three armies fought bravely. Huang Zhijun, Wang Changhou, and Fang Yumin won three consecutive matches. In the fifth group, E Cunzhong from Shanghai Provincial High School No. 1 defeated Zhuang Yongji from Fudan by three to two. As a result of the five singles matches, Fudan led by three to two. Then the doubles matches were held. Fudan relied on its well-coordinated pairings and won two more groups. In conclusion, Fudan defeated Shanghai Provincial High School No. 1 by five to two and won the championship. The strength of Shanghai Provincial High School No. 1 was not as good as that of Middle School No. 5 and the YMCA, so it was not easy to win the runner-up. After the finals, Lu Wenying presided over the auction of the paddles. The opening price was 500 yuan. As a result, Qian Zongfan, the general manager of Shangtian Funeral Home, bid 1,000 yuan and won the auction. His benevolence is commendable. Afterwards, a performance match was held by famous Shanghai table tennis players. The attendees included Lu Hanjun, Zhang Ying, Ouyang Wei, Chuan Qifang, Wang Changhou, and Deng Xiurong. The matches were wonderful and won a round of applause. After the performance, Wen Lantingshi presented the awards. The champion, Fudan, received three large silver cups, the runner-up, Shanghai Provincial High School No. 1, received two silver cups, and the third-place Middle School No. 5 and the fourth-place YMCA also received one large silver cup each. Finally, a group photo was taken and the event ended. In addition, the organizers donated all the 1,000 yuan from the paddle auction and all the ticket revenue to the China Women and Children's Association. The results of the finals are as follows:</p>

<h3>East China First Division Champions – Momentum Shaken</h3>
<p>The East China Football First Division champions, Tung Wah, have suffered two recent defeats. While the championship prospects are still hopeful, there is no denying that their momentum has been somewhat shaken. St. Francis has defeated Tung Wah and is only one point behind, which is a cause for concern. Although the Western Police team currently has fewer points than Tung Wah and St. Francis, their record is on par with Tung Wah, having also lost only twice. Furthermore, Tung Wah and the Western Police have not yet met, and their two upcoming matches will be the focal point for deciding this year's championship. In addition to the two matches against the Western Police, Tung Wah also has one match each against the Lusitano Portuguese and the North West Children's team. This weekend's match against Lusitano is extremely important. It is hoped that Tung Wah will do their best. The French Businessmen's team of the First Division has been winning consecutively lately and has risen to fifth place. The reserve team of Tung Wah drew with the Portuguese team. The Portuguese team is still in first place due to more points, but the Portuguese team has already drawn twice, so Tung Wah's championship hopes are quite high. In the Second Division, the British Navy, the French Army, the Russian Overseas Chinese Association are all tied for first place with four wins and one loss. Shanghai Recreation Club is in fourth place with three wins, one draw, and one loss. In the Third Division, Juventus has seven wins in seven games, Weituoning has five wins in five games, and Yi Zhong Tobacco has four wins and four victories, remaining undefeated. The championship seat in the future should not come from outside these three teams.</p>

<h3>Grains – Foreign Rice Hoarding Intensifies – Only Broken Rice and Rice Bran Available – Medium and High-Grade Foreign Rice Active Under the Table – Japonica Rice Prices Soar by Two or Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Foreign Rice market this year, after rising by two or three yuan for two consecutive days, yesterday it presented a situation of stalemate because there was no room for further increases. Regardless of medium or high-grade goods, none were displayed, and only broken rice and rice bran filled the market, causing general retail buyers who wanted to replenish their stock to be unable to find anything. This situation is hardly a blessing for the people's livelihood. The concessions still have no concrete measures to regulate the people's food. Although it is impossible to investigate price dark market transactions, rumors indicate that they are still extremely active. It is estimated that many people live by this. No. 1 Saigon is sold for 93 or 94 yuan, and No. 2 is subsidized by 600 yuan per hundred bags, with talk of an additional one yuan. Small-grain Zhilu goods are calculated per (160 catties) and sold for 77 yuan. Rice bran and broken rice are still conservatively priced due to sluggish sales, opening at 78 yuan for rice bran, settling at 76 yuan 3 jiao, broken pointed rice at 76 yuan, secondary at 74 yuan, and Qixi at 68 yuan 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Profit goods of Thick and Thin Japonica domestic rice continue to be scarce. However, because the market suffers from the difficulty of purchasing foreign rice, they are compelled to purchase domestic rice to prepare for emergencies. The buying sentiment rose sharply for a time. Due to the unevenness of supply and demand, the market increased even more. The prices of both thick and thin Japonica rice increased by two or three yuan. Kunshan saw white Japonica at 106.5 yuan, 106 yuan, and Qingjiao thin rice at 101 yuan, 100 yuan. This is truly an unprecedented record for the opening of the rice market. If this situation continues to rise all the way, then the high price of rice in the future will have no bottom, and the livelihood of the general public is really in a desperate situation. How can this be a blessing for the Shanghai concessions?</p>
<p>Glutinous rice is only an auxiliary product, with limited market demand, and there is a large stock of foreign glutinous rice, so the market is difficult to change and remains flat. Only glutinous rice bran is adopted by many because the selling price is the cheapest, and the market price has also increased by one yuan. Yili domestic yuan is still 92 or 93 yuan, Hong Kong yuan opens at 83 yuan, and next to 79.5 yuan, while glutinous rice bran opens high from 76 yuan, next to 72.5 yuan.</p>
<p>A large quantity of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company Jiangsu transported 10,359 bags from Hong Kong and arrived at the pier yesterday morning, unloaded at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession. In addition, the company's French freighter "Tranninh" directly loaded 19,143 bags from Haiphong and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, unloaded at the company's wharf in Pudong. A total of 29,502 bags of foreign rice arrived yesterday. (Grandfather)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot foreign rice was constrained by the surging domestic rice, and all the holders regarded the goods as scarce and insisted on not showing them, so the market transactions were mostly broken and mixed rice, except for a few medium settlements. Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 are almost extinct, but the situation of dark market subsidies can also be found. The limited price has not been relaxed, and it is threatened by a large number of new exchange futures of foreign rice. It is difficult for the cargo party to continue raising prices secretly. The clients of the trading groups have either changed to domestic rice or focused on futures, or watched from a distance due to the large number of orders. Therefore, only 5,000 bags of spot foreign rice were traded, and more than 1,000 tons of futures were returned. The market for returned futures was once called high in the early market, and the price went down with the people's hearts due to the crowding of orders. No. 1 Saigon in January opened at 98 yuan, February at 93 yuan, small-grain Zhilu goods at 87 yuan, January at 86 yuan, January 15 at 84.5 yuan, and February at 84 yuan, all similar to the previous prices. The total number of new transactions is no less than 100,000 bags (more than 10,000 tons). It is estimated that there are about 8,000 tons of small-grain in January and February, and a part of them have not been fully allocated. Shen Ji Foreign Firm threw out all of them at a price of 84.5 yuan to 84 yuan. He Yiyang Firm threw out 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 1 in January at a price of 96 yuan, Ding Tai threw out 1,000 tons in February at a price of 93 yuan, and Wan Xing threw out 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 1 in February at a price of 92.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flat-Priced Flour Continues to Be Supplied – Factory Price Changed to 21.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Flour – It has been found that the flat-priced hope for flour in this city has once caused panic in the market after it ended at the end of last year, leading to a sharp increase in foreign flour by nearly two yuan, and the people's flour food has been greatly affected. Yesterday, the Bureau of Economy and Industry agreed with the industry and factory side to continue to sell at a flat price. Sanfu New Factory still supplies 3,100 bags per day, Fufeng supplies 1,000 bags, and the rest is still matched with foreign flour. However, the factory price has been changed to 21.5 yuan, an increase of 3.5 yuan per bag compared with the previous price. Although it is said to be flat-priced, the common people can no longer afford it. As for foreign flour transactions, the market demand has naturally decreased because the flat-priced flour is already supplied, and the customer sales are also reluctant to buy more due to the high price. The rising wind has stopped, but the sellers are still hesitant and unwilling to let go. The general market has opened 10,000 bags of Clock Tower Flower Bird Brand Australian flour at a price of 24.5 yuan and 4 jiao 7.5 fen, and there are no other proper transactions.</p>
<p>Another message – According to foreign firm news yesterday, 9,000 bags of Five Swallow Brand Australian flour have newly arrived, shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai and unloaded at the Jinliyuan Warehouse on the Bund. It is said that the quality of the goods is similar to that of Clock Tower Flower Bird. It has not yet been shown and sold. It is said that Weida Foreign Firm will open 100,000 bags of Kampfen flour at a price of 22 yuan 7 or 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Wheat – Yesterday's wheat transaction was as lonely as usual. The source of goods from various places was even scarcer due to the rain. The flour factories wanted to buy but had no goods. There was only shouting prices in the market, but no actual transactions. At present, the general holders, in view of the high price of flour, are making the raw materials even more scarce. The Japanese factories still intend to absorb futures, but the merchants do not open them. It is heard that the price of goods in the concession must be around 35 yuan, and the purchase price of Japanese factories must also be outside 30 yuan. The market is still calm and quiet.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market – Japanese Merchants Absorbing at Low Prices – Sugar Price Decline Slows Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was very soft, and the decline continued. Later, Japanese merchants absorbed a total of 4,000 to 5,000 bags of crude white and B-mark car white, which did not lead to a large drop. The guild's marking price, spot 24 crude white outside the warehouse is 79 yuan 6 jiao, small 4 jiao, Dutch red spot is 67 yuan 5 jiao to 2 jiao, small 8 jiao, January 15th list is 67 yuan 7 jiao to 3 jiao, small 7 jiao, Taikoo car white B mark is 79 yuan 3 jiao to 1 jiao, later 79 yuan small 7 jiao, DY mark is 78 yuan, small 3 jiao, HX mark is 77 yuan 7 jiao to 5 jiao, small 5 jiao, H mark car red east warehouse is 64 yuan small 6 jiao half, 757 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Securities – Unified Bonds Exceed Legal Limit Price – All Bonds Rise More Than One Yuan Each</h3>
<p>Public debt dark market, yesterday has restored the full-day transaction, the market situation is a meteoric rise, there is no language to describe, five kinds of public debt, up and down the market at any time found a new high price, A species has worn out the legal limit price of 76 yuan after 813, this kind of public debt 11th lottery, scheduled to be held on February 10, the number of lottery branches has increased sharply to 36, the period is also getting shorter and shorter, so it is particularly superior to other, The US$50 million Sino-US Fund contract is about to be signed, so although "Jiangning" Bank has already opened, the general financial situation in Shanghai is still the same as before, and at this time, when the interest is about to expire and the ordinary deposit interest is reduced, the continued rise in market prices is not unexpected. At present, it is absolutely impossible to measure the market situation with the ordinary perspective of previous years, because the current interest rate is still above one point. Yesterday's buyers, in addition to half of the short-covering and a few floating longs, there is quite a large number of financial institutions absorbing, such as Yuxing Xinfu Lianhe Lemaozhongyi and other families, are buying each item up and down the market, and the rest in the morning are Yitai Renchang Datong Tongshun, and in the afternoon there are Jufeng Xie Kang Zhenkang Shuntai and No. 16 are either short-covering or long-doing. At the same time, sellers such as Runli Shengda Juchang Tongkang are also very active in either shorting or closing long positions. The rest such as Hongda Songmao, Yongkang Xiekang, and in the afternoon such as Shengchang Yizhong Lianyi Zhenkang, etc., are all selling. The market is very lively and the potential is quite strong. The future is just beginning. As a result, the market prices rose uniformly by one yuan two jiao to one yuan nine jiao half. The total number of transactions was more than 260,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions, 100 shares of Huashang Electric were transacted at a price of 8 yuan 2 jiao, an increase of 8 jiao from the previous day.</p>
<p>The public industry stock market opened, slightly softened due to the over-extended long profits on the previous week being taken. After entering the market, most industrial stocks did not fluctuate much, but the number of transactions was large.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton – Non-Industry Shorts – Double Horse Plummets – But Peers Are Buying on the Cheap</h3>
<p>The yarn market is tired, and the falling wind is very strong. This is because the foreign exchange is turning to long positions, and gold is falling, so people's hearts are more softened. As for the Jinzi gang, they are completely based on the above situation for expansion and contraction, so most of them have turned from long to short, and the table has been greatly loosened as a result. However, half of the peers have already stopped doing Double Horse, and half have turned long, thinking optimistically, and are still buying today, so the situation is still stable. As for the actual sales, the Hong Kong gang's sporadic purchases are still not weak. The high price of 20-count Double Horse is 1,380 yuan, and the low price is 1,345 yuan.

<h3>Indian Cotton Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday – But the Source is Becoming Scarce</h3>
<p>The situation of spot cotton is still dark and uninteresting. This is because the foreign exchange is turning to long-term, and it is rumored that the cotton yarn Shanghai West gang has come out, and the market may have a loose step, so the cotton market is even less interesting.

The buying intention of Chinese factories has always been weak, but the buying intention of Japanese factories has not seen a turn for the better. Trading between peers has not been active. According to reliable statistics, the arrival of raw cotton is becoming increasingly scarce, so it is predicted that the cotton in the future will still be optimistic.</p>

<h3>Economic Talk</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Kerosene (1)</p>
<p>Kerosene is also called petroleum, and was initially called "foreign oil" because it came from foreign countries. China used vegetable oil for lighting. In ancient times, wealthy families mostly burned candles. Kou Zhun of the Song Dynasty was the most extravagant and never burned oil. Even in the stables, he used candles, which proves this. Vegetable oil is used to light lamps, using rush pith to ignite the oil, and its light is not bright, so it is said that the lamplight is like a bean, meaning that the light of the lamp is as big as a soybean.</p>
<p>Since kerosene came to China, it gradually became popular in the interior around 20 years before and after the Guangxu period. Although users think that its brightness far exceeds that of oil lamps, because the quality of mineral oil and vegetable oil are different, kerosene is easy to ignite, so those who regard kerosene as rapeseed oil and soybean oil often set fires. Furthermore, old oil lamps cannot be used to light kerosene, and the commonly used "foreign oil hand lamps" are not only easy to tip over, but also the oil is not easy to burn completely, and the coal is more gaseous and evil, so it cannot be popular. The Meifu Oil Company knew this, so they created the "Meifu Oil Lamp", a container for oil with a large and flat bottom, which would not tip over, and the number of kerosene lamp fires gradually decreased. It has a handle, which can be carried by hand, which is convenient for household use. There is a glass lampshade on it to shield the wind, and it is not easy to be blown out by the wind during movement. There is a lamp holder in the middle with a gauze belt to light the fire and produce light, and there is a twist to increase or decrease the brightness of the light. Not only can the coal in the oil be burned almost completely, but also the light is bright, far better than the old days when a lamp was flickering. Not only that, Meifu also printed the words "Meifu" or "Light Meifu Oil" on the lampshade and the outer surface of the oil container. At first, it was given to users as a gift, and then users scrambled to buy it, so kerosene penetrated into the folk, and no one did not know what is called "Old Brand Oil". Those who followed Meifu Oil still had Asiatic and other oils, but Meifu was the old brand. (To be continued)</p>

The high prices attracted goods from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, and other routes in recent weeks, but the local market had limited sales, and supply exceeded demand, causing prices to fall.

<h3>Municipal Council Board Election: Britain and the United States Gain Widespread Sympathy, Nationals of Various Countries Unanimously Express Inclination, The Status Quo of the Public Concession is Expected to Be Maintained</h3>
<p>The next Municipal Council Board election is only a little over three months away. However, as the Japanese are eager to increase the number of Japanese directors in the election, the competition is more intense than in the previous election. It is reported that since the Municipal Council began preparing for the Board election, the first batch of the roster of foreign nationals with voting rights has been compiled. However, this roster is a list of foreign nationals who had voting rights previously. As for foreign nationals who have voting rights this year, it is still being compiled. Therefore, in this Board election, it is currently difficult to know for sure whether the British and American side or the Japanese side will have a majority. However, foreign nationals from other countries in Shanghai, such as France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Norway, can be said to unanimously favor the British and American side in order to maintain the status quo of the Public Concession. As for German and Italian merchants, for the sake of doing business in Shanghai in the future, many believe that maintaining the status quo of the Public Concession is advisable.</p>
<p>Japanese Nationals Carefully Selected: Preparations Have Been Long Underway</p>
<p>According to those familiar with the Municipal Council Board election, the enthusiasm of the Japanese side for this Board election is unprecedented in the history of Municipal Council elections. The Japanese Residents' Association is making every effort, and preparations have been underway for more than seven months. They are engaged in dividing voting rights for Japanese nationals and are striving to expand the Japanese national vote. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine the large number of Japanese national votes this time.</p>
<p>British and American Cooperation: Sufficient to Contend</p>
<p>As for the British and American united front, it is still jointly presided over by the British and American Residents' Committees. In terms of the property of British and American nationals in the Public Concession, it far exceeds that of the Japanese nationals. However, the number of British and American nationals is far less than that of the Japanese nationals. In addition, American nationals are gradually withdrawing, and British nationals are returning home to serve the country. In terms of the current situation, the outcome is not optimistic. Therefore, the British and American united front must make special efforts and allow close cooperation with other Western nationals in order to compete with the Japanese nationals.</p>

<h3>Market Sentiment Boosted: Public Bonds Surge: Customs-Guaranteed Bonds Paid Regularly: All Bondholders Unanimously Believe in and Support</h3>
<p>In order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance has never been overdue in the payment of principal and interest on various new bonds issued after the war. Customs-guaranteed Unified, Reconstruction, and Gold &amp; Long three bonds, customs outside the war zone, continue to allocate funds as usual, and the Central Bank stores the special funds. Because the allocated funds are not enough to pay the principal and interest, the National Debt Fund Management Committee negotiated with the four major banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture to discount and pay the principal and interest of the Unified, Reconstruction, and Gold &amp; Long three bonds that are due. Now the Central Bank has been ordered to discount and pay on schedule.

<h3>Shanghai All Sectors Prepare to Promote the Spring Gift Army慰勞 Movement: Transfer the Object of Gifts to Console Soldiers: Special Circumstances Centralize the Solicitation of 代金</h3>
<p>The National慰勞 General Association launched a spring gift army慰勞 movement last year to console soldiers. All provinces, cities, and counties across the country responded enthusiastically. The Spring Festival this year is approaching soon, and various places will continue to promote it under the leadership of the National慰勞 General Association, in order to encourage morale, continue their efforts, and complete the great mission. All sectors in Shanghai achieved remarkable results in participating in the spring gift army慰勞 last year and were commended by the authorities. As the Spring Festival is approaching, all parties have made preparations in advance in order to make a full presentation at that time. Due to environmental reasons, it is difficult to transfer赠送 goods, so it has been decided to maintain the tradition of collecting 代金, which will be collected by various state-owned banks and transferred to the Ministry of Finance's donation account for慰勞 purposes. The spring gift army慰勞 movement is more meaningful than赠送 gifts to relatives and friends. It is expected that all sectors of the public will vigorously promote it.</p>

Some beggars look extremely tattered and dirty, but they hide the most money, some up to about 30 yuan. A certain female beggar even holds a tax payer certificate for the French Concession. There are also several beggars who voluntarily enter the shelter. In addition, some beggars are chased and arrested by the police and押入 into the shelter.</p>

The required 20,000 bags of rice arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month, and the committee has completed all procedures. The eighth phase of Pingyao will start at 1 p.m. today for a total of 15 days.

<p>Send Personnel to Supervise to Prevent Malpractices</p>
<p>In the previous phases of Pingyao Tribute Rice, there were many complaints from the outside world about the rice shops that handled the rice, such as rice shops changing and selling inferior goods, or rice shops hiding and not selling. In order to be cautious, the committee will send personnel to various locations every day to conduct mobile supervision. Yesterday, it also sent letters to the banking industry, business industry, cotton cloth industry, and yarn factory joint donations Pingyao, the financial groups requested to send personnel to assist in supervision. The original letter said, "Our committee's eighth phase of Pingyao is scheduled to open on January 7th of this year, for a total of 15 days. However, since there are many complaints from the outside world about the rice shops that handle the rice, in order to be cautious, we plan to ask your organization to assign voluntary personnel to be our committee's inspectors and assign them to various locations to assist in supervision in order to prevent malpractices.</p>
<p>The Price of Domestic Rice Increases by 2 to 3 Yuan</p>
<p>After the rice market industry trade reached a price limit for 14 grades of foreign rice and prohibited rice brokers from entering the market as intermediaries, the market situation once became calm. However, recently, speculative rice merchants have revived and attempted to raise prices, holding a large amount of spot goods for speculation and fabricating falsehoods, making it difficult to know the truth. As a result, people were uneasy and the market situation became tight from soft. Yesterday, due to rain, the price of domestic rice increased by as much as 2 to 3 yuan, which was truly shocking. The reporter also felt chills. Is it still possible to postpone the severe punishment of rice merchants? Now the relevant authorities have been commissioned to deal with these rice merchants according to the law, and we can wait and see. Yesterday, the market price of foreign rice was also affected by the increase in the price of domestic rice. High-quality goods have not even been seen. The relevant parties will inspect and report those who have one of the following circumstances in accordance with the regulations of the National Government: (1) Those who do not sell within a certain period of time; (2) Those who seek illegal profits.</p>
<p>More Than 40,000 Bags Arrived Within Six Days</p>
<p>Since the source of domestic rice in the city was blocked, the livelihood of the people depended entirely on the supply of foreign rice. Rice merchants spread rumors, causing rice prices to reach today's peak, and the livelihood of the people is worrying. The source of foreign rice is smooth and there is no concern about interruption. There was a sufficient inventory last year, and many arrived in Shanghai in the New Year. On the 1st, the Yihuo Fusheng ship brought 1,989 bags from Hong Kong. On the 2nd, the Mingsheng ship also transported 1,335 bags from Hong Kong. On the same day, the Taikoo Company's Hunan ship brought 8,342 bags from Hong Kong. On the 3rd, the Yihuo Rilu ship brought 1,148 bags from Hong Kong. In addition, the Taikoo Suzhou ship transported 1,936 bags from Hong Kong.

<h3>Citing Emergency Regulations, Rice Merchants Who Raise Prices are Sentenced: Zhang Duolong Sentenced to 10 Months in Prison: Those Who Hoard and Manipulate are Sentenced to Death According to Law</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize rice prices and prevent rice merchants from hoarding and speculating, the Public Concession's Municipal Council, in conjunction with rice industry groups, has set various price limits for foreign rice. In order to prevent price increases in secret, the Municipal Council's Political Department ordered detectives to closely monitor the rice market. Anyone who dares to violate this will be severely investigated and will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>Violation of Regulations Leads to Detention</p>
<p>On the morning of the 3rd of this month, Mao Guobao, the inspector of the Political Department, and Li Bijun, a detective, discovered that Zhang Junlong, the resident representative of Wanshengtai Rice Store at No. 52 Maoyi Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, sold 50 dan of small-grain rice (price limit 79 yuan per dan) to Tan Mingde, the representative of Songshun Xieji Rice Store at No. 94 Henan Road, at a price of 79.7 yuan per dan. The two detectives believed that the transaction price between the buyer and seller exceeded the price limit by 0.7 yuan per dan, which was a clear violation of the fair price, so they were arrested and detained together. On the way to the Lao Zha Police Station, Zhang Junlong offered the detectives 300 yuan as a bribe in an attempt to be released, but the detectives refused. On the 4th, they were escorted to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court for a hearing and detained.</p>
<p>The Police Station Attaches Importance</p>
<p>Now, in order to curb the effect of cracking down on price-gouging transactions and stabilizing the rice market, the Legal Department of the Municipal Council, represented by lawyer Qian Xunjiu, cited Article 14 of the "Emergency Period Measures for Stabilizing Commodity Prices and Cracking Down on Speculation," Article 15 and Article 32 of the "Emergency Period Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce," and Article 122 of the Criminal Law on bribery, etc., to prosecute Zhang Junlong in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Since the above-mentioned regulations did not have explicit provisions for punishing the buyer, the part of Tan Mingde was separately prosecuted by Fang Fushu, a lawyer representing the department, to the Police Court of the First Special Court. After being tried by Judge Fei and Judge Shen of the Special Court in the Criminal Court and the Criminal Court No. 9 respectively, the result was that Zhang Junlong was sentenced to 10 months imprisonment for violating the fair price, and Tan Mingde was sentenced to 15 days of detention. It is understood that this case is the first case in which the Municipal Council has adopted this regulation to file a lawsuit. The regulation is very severe on those who hoard, speculate, and manipulate, and the highest penalty is death or life imprisonment. It is said that a certain mayor of the capital was sentenced to capital punishment based on this regulation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldier Stabbed on New Year's Day: Injuries Have Recovered</h3>
<p>The American Evening Post reported that according to news from the Japanese authorities this morning (6th), Takahashi, a Japanese soldier stabbed near Jiangwan recently, is now lying in the Japanese Military Hospital and his injuries have recovered.

<h3>Family Bread Prices Slightly Increased</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the price of flour is relatively high and the cost has increased, the bread companies in the two concessions have applied to the Municipal Councils of the two concessions to increase the price of "family bread" from 4.5 jiao to 5 jiao per pound in order to help make up for it. The above-mentioned price will be adjusted at any time once the situation improves.</p>
<h3>Planned Expansion of Relief Efforts: Dr. Baker Arrives in Shanghai to Coordinate Relief Work in Shanghai and the Interior; Large Quantities of Food and Medicine Are Shipped from the United States</h3>
<p>Dr. Baker, Director of the China Relief Department of the American Red Cross and Executive Director of the China International Famine Relief Commission, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 6:15 PM aboard the President Pierce, a ship of the American President Lines. At a time when local charitable organizations are struggling with soaring rice prices and preparing for winter relief efforts, Dr. Baker's arrival is like seeing clouds in a great drought, which is a great comfort to everyone. Dr. Baker will stay here for two weeks before departing for Hong Kong and then Chongqing.</p>
<p>Fundraising in the United States: 50 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Dr. Baker took the opportunity of returning to the United States to appeal there, arousing the sympathy and assistance of the American people for the Chinese victims of disaster. He and his friends jointly launched a fundraising campaign for a relief fund to purchase medicines, clothing, and food to be shipped to China to relieve the refugees. This matter was done in cooperation with the American government, and the total amount has reached 50 million yuan. The U.S. Congress passed a bill authorizing the President to provide relief to the disaster-stricken refugees in a neutral capacity. President Roosevelt also authorized the American Red Cross to handle the matter, and all funds were drawn from the Treasury Department, which raised funds from the American people, who enthusiastically donated.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Interior and Relief Efforts</p>
<p>After completing his public duties in the United States, Dr. Baker flew to Manila and returned to China via the Burma Road, inspecting the situation in the Chinese rear and opening up new avenues for relief. At the same time, he understood the transportation situation in the Southwest in order to transport large quantities of relief supplies to China via this route. His assistant, Mr. Zhang Sili, the Deputy Director of the China Relief Department of the Red Cross, remained in Lashio, Burma, to be responsible for the transportation of relief supplies to China via the Burma Road. Dr. Baker also personally inspected refugee relief work in Kunming, Yishan, Guiyang, Guilin, and Liuzhou, expressing great satisfaction. After completing the planning for the distribution of medicines, he returned to Hong Kong via Hengyang and Shaoguan.</p>
<p>Planned Expansion of the Scope of Work</p>
<p>In addition to handling general official duties, Dr. Baker's visit is also intended to closely link the relief work in the interior with that in Shanghai and the occupied areas, while proceeding simultaneously. Although relief work began after the Sino-Japanese War, the scope was quite small, limited to the occupied areas. The current plan is to expand this work to the Chinese rear. In order to increase the speed of progress, it is appropriate for Dr. Baker to come to Shanghai in person. The American Red Cross has two branches in China, one in Shanghai, which manages affairs in the East China region, and one in Chongqing, which focuses on West China. There is also a transportation station in Lashio, where Dr. Baker's assistant, Mr. Wesley, works.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Medicine Shipped to China</p>
<p>As for the relief medicines shipped from the United States to China, in addition to the 150 tons of rice and 350 tons of wheat, totaling 20,000 bags, worth 450,000 yuan, shipped to Shanghai by the Collinsworth in November of last year, and the 200 tons of medicines shipped to Rangoon for transshipment to the interior, worth 350,000 yuan, there were also three batches of vitamin pills shipped to China by clipper planes from San Francisco on the 17th, 24th, and 31st of last month. Another batch of 100,000 pills was carried by the President Taft on the 20th of last month and arrived in port on the 19th of this month. Dr. Baker may participate in its distribution.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Busts Drug Trafficking Organization: Specializes in Transporting Drugs to Shanghai; Police Authorities Have Paid Attention</h3>
<p>The Tianjin British Municipal Council busted a large-scale drug trafficking organization in the concession last week, arresting 17 people. According to their confession, they specialize in trafficking drugs from Tianjin to Shanghai. Their method of smuggling is to hollow out wooden clothes racks, mirror frames, and cots for concealment, and transport them to Shanghai by ship. The method is extremely secretive. The police authorities have now paid close attention.</p>
<h3>Mr. Weng Wenhao Estimates: Last Year's Industrial and Mining Production in Free China Exceeded 10 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>According to an estimate by Mr. Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs, the total value of industrial and mining production in Free China in 1940 exceeded 10 billion yuan, of which private enterprises accounted for 255 million yuan. The production value of the metal industry was 42 million yuan, the machine industry 21 million yuan, the electrical industry 11 million yuan, the chemical industry 21 million yuan, the textile industry 119 million yuan, and the food industry 38 million yuan. The production volume of state-owned factories reached 550 million yuan. Tungsten sand, tin, antimony, mercury, copper, and other minerals were worth a total of 370 million yuan. The above figures do not include household industries and small enterprises.</p>
<p>Relocation of Factories</p>
<p>There are 448 industrial and mining factories in Free China. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, a total of 120,000 tons of machinery has been relocated inland, worth 360 million yuan, of which 70,000 tons were subsidized by the government. Among the relocated factories, 254 were located in Sichuan Province, 120 in Hunan Province, 27 in Shaanxi, 23 in Guangxi, and 23 were scattered in various provinces. A total of 12,000 technical workers were subsidized by the government to work in the interior.</p>
<p>Wartime Needs</p>
<p>In 1940, approximately 6,000 tons of industrial materials were imported from overseas, and the government supplied foreign exchange at the statutory exchange rate. Most of the industrial and mining factories in Free China are managed by the government. The factories recently established are able to meet wartime needs. The power of the Central Machinery Factory is 2,000 kilowatts. In addition, there are factories for electrical materials, wireless electrical materials, copper production, and alcohol refining. In addition to the machinery relocated from the coast to the interior, another 10,000 tons of machinery was added.</p>
<p>Mineral Development</p>
<p>The copper mines in Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan are currently being developed by the government. 50 million yuan of capital has been raised for the tin mines in Yunnan, preparing to develop the tin manufacturing industry. Coal mines are also being actively exploited, and will be able to supply the needs of the railways in Hunan, Guangxi, and Yunnan. There are 12 power plants, located in major cities, with a total power of 20,000 kilowatts. There are currently two paper mills in the Free Area that have begun production, and the remaining two will start operations in the spring. Textile factories have 200,000 spindles, 160,000 of which are in Sichuan. Sichuan is now planning to establish a new industrial zone, and factories for the wool textile industry, dye industry, etc., will be set up.</p>
<h3>Asbestos and Walnuts Are Prohibited Items</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified various trade associations that asbestos has been designated as a prohibited item by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Walnuts are produced in various parts of China, and the production in the Northwest provinces is quite abundant. The Japanese have collected large quantities in the north. Both the kernels and shells can be used, and they should also be prohibited from export.</p>
<h3>The Huangpu River Will Have a Winter Low Tide: Only One Foot or So</h3>
<p>The tide of the Huangpu River is highest in the autumn and lowest in the winter. According to the Jupu Bureau's calculation method, the lowest tide of the Huangpu River is the starting point, and the highest tide has reached more than 14 feet, while the bund embankment is only 13 feet high. As a result, the roads are flooded by the tide. Fortunately, the tide rises and falls at a fixed time, so the flooding is temporary. This is from the perspective of high tide. Low tide is also a serious problem for navigation. For example, at the Roosevelt Wharf, when the winter tide is low, ships berthing alongside are often grounded and cannot be started, and must wait until the tide rises to be able to sail. The above situation has been seen many times. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the lowest tides of this month will be on the 10th, 18th, 28th, 29th, and 30th, all of which will be only one foot or so. Its impact on navigation in the Huangpu River is no less than that of high tide and is equally worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Detailed Information on Cao Jiancai, the "Town Head" of Sijing, Embezzling and Appropriating Funds</h3>
<p>According to a person from Songjiang, the history of the suffering of the people of Sijing County is very detailed, as follows. It is said that Cao Jiancai, the "Town Head" of Sijing, was originally a local tyrant from Qingpu. He had some kind of private friendship with the former "County Head" of Songjiang, Zhang Shouzhi, so he managed to be appointed to the area and did whatever he wanted, oppressing the people. The people were all disgusted. A fire broke out in the town a month ago. The Japanese army planned to widen the streets. Cao took the opportunity to collect more than one yuan per household from the people for paving the streets. Zhou Guanqing, a foreman, contracted for more than 4,000 yuan of the project. After the work was completed, he only received more than 2,000 yuan. Another foreman, Dai Zhaogen, contracted for more than 6,000 yuan, but Cao only paid 4,000 yuan. The rest of the money was pocketed. When Zhou and Dai asked him to pay the remaining money, they were detained. All the street paving bricks were ordered by Cao to be demolished from the graves of the people, so that more than 80 graves were destroyed. Usually, all kinds of exorbitant taxes are endless. Furthermore, the stone slabs owned by a certain private person were forcibly claimed by Cao as public property and embezzled. There is also the Yuan Da Timber Company, which Cao forcibly claimed to manage. Such things are too numerous to mention. Therefore, the villagers hated him to the bone because of their pain.</p>

<h3>Various Industries Express Support for Legal Tender and Reject Miscellaneous Paper Money</h3>
<p>Various industries believe that the legal tender, which is prepared to be fully implemented, is the only currency of China and express their unwavering support for it. All transactions, since the abolition of taels and the implementation of the legal tender policy, have been conducted in legal tender. They have decided to abide by the tenets of the National Public Law regarding any unapproved miscellaneous paper money, and unanimously refuse to accept or use it, and will not do business with those who do. This is to strengthen finance, and they have agreed with the banking and money industries and various friendly banks to unanimously refuse to accept it. Money changers have also decided to refuse to buy and sell it, and tobacco shops refuse to exchange it, so miscellaneous paper money is rarely seen on the market.</p>

<h3>A Young Woman Steals a Dancer's Coat at a Dance Hall; Arrested After Being Lured to See a Movie by the Dancer; Two Stolen Coats Were Retrieved</h3>
<p>Wang Suqin, a 19-year-old woman from Suzhou living at 34 Meiren Lane, Beile Road, is currently working as a dancer at the Laodahua Dance Hall on Malang Road. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month at 8:00 PM, when Wang Suqin went to the dance hall to dance, she took off her hairball long camel hair coat worth more than 200 yuan and hung it on hook number 16 on the wall in the restroom of the dance hall. When she went to retrieve the coat after dancing late at night to go home, it was gone. She immediately reported it to the French police and requested an investigation. Detective Zhou Jingyuan began the investigation and believed that it was stolen by Su Lianfang (20 years old, from Suzhou, living on Pube Road, working at the Sino-American Radio Station), a female friend of another dancer at the same place who was brought into the hall to play. It was mortgaged at the Yicheng Pawnshop at 261 Beile Road for 60 yuan. However, it was not possible to arrest Xue Lianfang at the time. The victim, Wang Suqin, lured Xue to the Jincheng Theater to see a movie and reported it to the French police. Detective Zhou and a Public Concession detective rushed to the Jincheng Theater and arrested Xue Yunfang. Two pawn tickets were found in her home, one for Wang's stolen coat and the other for a dancer's coat stolen from a dance hall a month ago. According to the detectives, the stolen goods were retrieved. The police chief ordered Xue to be detained pending investigation. The defendant, Xue Yunfang, is young and beautiful, with a slender figure and modern clothes, so she can enter and exit various dance halls without arousing suspicion and perform her sleight of hand techniques. According to the investigating detectives, Xue is an old hand at this technique. Unexpectedly, she was caught and arrested this time.</p>

<p>According to the "North China Daily News," the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade received its thirteenth fire alarm of the year shortly after the thirteenth hour yesterday (the 5th). Fire trucks were dispatched to extinguish the fire, which took thirteen minutes to put out. The fire occurred at the home of a firefighter. Many firefighters will therefore believe that thirteen is an unlucky number. The incident occurred around 1:00 PM yesterday, when the fire department headquarters received a report of carelessness at No. 17, Lane 1463, Gordon Road and forwarded it to the Yichang Road Fire Brigade. As it happened, the telephone operator at the Yichang Road Fire Brigade was a shareholder in the house where the fire broke out. He notified the fire truck to rush to extinguish the fire. The driver of the fire truck was also a shareholder in the house. The fire started in a small room above the kitchen, caused by unextinguished charcoal brought in on Saturday and Sunday. The fire was quickly extinguished, and the damage was minimal, with only some bedding and clothing burned.</p>

<h3>The Happiness of Having No Inheritance</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yun</p>
<p>When my father left us, he did not leave behind a single penny of inheritance. In fact, it was already fortunate that my father did not leave behind any "debts." How could we dare hope that he would leave behind an inheritance like others?</p>
<p>My father was an honest and upright person throughout his life, so he never made any windfall. I believe that every penny he earned was earned by his own power in a proper way. Throughout his life, he cultivated a large group of children, ensuring that they all received a full and perfect education, that they could all support themselves, and that they could all be useful people in society. Limited income prevented him from saving, and the large number of children made it impossible for him to accumulate money. Although he did not leave behind any inheritance, we do not blame him. We believe that his view was correct, we believe that he has done his best, and we have no reason to complain.</p>
<p>What he left us was an interest in life, practical knowledge, a broad mind, a quick mind, and a loyal and honest heart. What he left us was the most valuable intangible inheritance, an inexhaustible and inexhaustible inheritance, an inheritance that cannot be rusted or stolen.</p>
<p>Although my father did not leave us any inheritance, we are satisfied and grateful. We feel the happiness of having no inheritance.</p>

<h3>Diplomat Zigong</h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>In the film "Confucius," Zigong has very few scenes, which is a real flaw. Because among Confucius' disciples, Zigong's importance is above that of Zilu and Yan Hui. Zilu was just a wealthy farmer, and Yan Hui was somewhat like a declining aristocrat; only Zigong was a truly vigorous "scholar," an emerging merchant landlord.</p>
<p>Confucius said, "Zi Ci does not accept fate and trades." Trading means doing business. Once you get used to doing business, your words of courtesy are particularly pleasant, so he is the top student in rhetoric among Confucius' disciples.</p>
<p>Moreover, being familiar with the business principles makes him particularly sensitive to distinguishing between "profit" and "harm." The monarchs of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods all received lobbyists with the criterion of "Will it also benefit my country?" Therefore, Zigong's words were particularly easy to touch their hearts.</p>
<p>Confucius was from Lu, and his "school" was also located in Lu. At that time, Lu was a weak country. Later, Tian Chang, a powerful minister of Qi, wanted to invade.</p>
<p>When this news spread to Confucius' "school," Confucius said to his disciples, "Lu is the place where the tombs are located, the country of our parents; the country is in such danger, why don't you do anything!"</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, Zilu had already stood up. But Confucius persuaded him to stay. Zizhang and Zishi also volunteered, but Confucius did not agree to either of them. Later, Zigong said that he was willing to go outside to think of a way to see, and Confucius allowed it. So Zigong asked for official leave and left them.</p>
<p>Zigong met Tian Chang and, after a few sweet words, Tian Chang's original intention was shaken. He advised Tian Chang not to attack Lu but to attack Wu, because Wu was a strong country, and it would not be too embarrassing to be defeated, and the victory would immediately shake the world. With such benefits, Tian Chang was of course willing to comply, but if he changed his strategy for no reason, the ministers of Qi would probably be suspicious, so he asked Zigong to go to Wu once to let the King of Wu send his troops to the door himself.</p>
<p>"Saving Lu is to show fame; attacking Qi is a great benefit." Of course, the King of Wu was willing to accept Zigong's opinion if he could gain both fame and fortune. But behind Wu there was Yue. King Goujian of Yue was lying on firewood and tasting gall to avenge the King of Wu! Under such circumstances, how could the army of Wu dare to be transferred out for a distant expedition?</p>
<p>So Zigong ran to Yue again, asking Goujian to send troops with the Wu army to attack Qi. In this way, the King of Wu had no worries.</p>
<p>Goujian's preparations were not fully prepared at that time, so of course he did not dare to disobey the orders of the King of Wu. But he did not forget the past hatred, so he asked Zigong to find a way for him. Zigong said, "If you want to defeat Wu, you must first weaken Wu. Then I will go to Jin again to let the King of Wu fight another battle with Jin."</p>
<p>Sure enough, after the King of Wu attacked Qi and Tian Chang was defeated, he competed with Jin in Huangchi. At this time, the elite soldiers and generals of Wu had almost died or were injured. King Goujian crossed the river and attacked Wu, destroying Wu and killing the King of Wu.</p>
<p>Zigong came out and made such a big circle, and as a result, "Lu was saved, Qi was thrown into chaos, Wu was destroyed, Jin was strengthened, and Yue became the overlord." "Within ten years, the five countries have changed." (Historical Records, Biography of Zhongni's Disciples)</p>
<p>In this way, Zigong is really a great diplomat!</p>
<p>Perhaps you think it is not appropriate to put this episode in the "Confucius" film - there is only one Zigong here.</p>
<p>But this episode shows the greatness of Confucius even more. Not only because Zigong's talents were guided by Confucius; but also we can see the spirit shown by Confucius, the educator, when the ancestral tomb site was threatened.</p>
<p>He did not say, "Be content! Studying is to save the country!" Students! In this eventful time for the country, "Why don't you do anything?"</p>
<h3>Chinese Crabapple</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>However, he himself never felt that there was anything to be happy about. Because less than a month after he joined the troupe, the troupe leader, Song, designated him to learn Qingyi opera and changed his name to a completely woman-like name—Wu Yuqin. From then on, he seemed to have become a woman in spirit; the mischievous older brothers surrounded him and teased him all day long, and Mr. Ye, who taught Xiaosheng opera with a wicked look in his eyes, would hug him and kiss him whenever he had the chance; even his two sworn brothers—the eldest, Liu Yuhua, who learned Laosheng; and the second, Zhao Yukun, who played Wuchou, who could be said to be his most congenial classmates—sometimes couldn't help but call him "madam" and "wife" with the lines from the opera, even though their hearts were just as pure towards him. Therefore, he gradually developed a strange psychology himself, almost suspecting that he was really a girl!</p>
<p>"Third brother, why do you miss home so much? Am I not good to you?" Seeing that he was always silent, Yuhua gradually walked up to him, lowered his head, gently put his right hand on his shoulder, and said with the air of an elder brother.</p>
<p>In fact, at this time, Yuqin was not thinking about home there, he was thinking about the situation of the most recent debut six or seven days ago.</p>
<p>One night, he sang "Su San's Departure." From the moment he appeared on stage until he left the stage, the applause from the audience almost never stopped. This was a common situation every time he debuted and did not make him pay much attention; however, among these cheering people, there was an exceptionally strong voice that made him feel scared in his heart as soon as he heard it. This voice was really good material for singing the Big Painted Face. As soon as it shouted, it completely drowned out the cheers of others; but the voice was very rough, very frivolous, completely like the roar of a wild beast during the mating season. Moreover, after this person shouted "Good!", many people next to him followed him in shouting, or there was a burst of frantic applause, mixed with fragments of laughter, as if the rough voice was the leader of this group of people, and everyone followed him everywhere.</p>
<p>"Father, please come up and accept a bow from your child!" When Yuqin sang about Su San bowing to Chong Gongdao as a foster father, that rough voice roared like a muffled thunder again.</p>
<p>This time his voice was even louder, and because he was sitting in the front row, the shout almost came out next to Yuqin's ear; Yuqin and the clown who was the escort were startled, and the two of them couldn't help but look towards the place where the shout came from. (2)</p>
<h3>Words on Self-Cultivation (4)</h3>
<p>According to young people, where is my way out? Going east is not a way out, going west is not a way out, so they are very annoyed and call out the cry of spiritual pain. In fact, there are ways out everywhere, as long as you are good at discovering them and using them. The broad road is a way out, and the road full of thorns is not necessarily not a way out. To cut through thorns requires courage. Once the thorns are gone, it is also a smooth road!</p>

<h3>Excerpts from an Elementary School Teacher's Diary</h3>
<p>— Xu Ping</p>
<p>September 6th:</p>
<p>"What is the use of you, Dad?"</p>
<p>Ling graduated from elementary school and should be going to middle school this semester.</p>
<p>Most of the middle schools have already started classes. I dare not delay his future. Last week, I asked him to apply to ×× Middle School. He has already received the admission notice and is required to complete the admission procedures within three days. Now, counting it up, it has been a week. Ling often urges me to complete the formalities for him so that he can go to class. However, I never think so, but that thing is too unhelpful.</p>
<p>At lunchtime, Ling urged again, "What is the use of you, Dad?"</p>
<p>Ling is already a twelve-year-old child, and his words are a bit tactless. His mother smiled along with him. I felt at a loss and had nothing to say to him, feeling quite ashamed of being a dad.</p>
<p>October 21st:</p>
<p>Ling's Mother Stopped Working</p>
<p>Ling's mother has been　at the yarn factory for almost two months. My burden is relatively lighter, but living conditions are quite inconvenient. I have to cook myself, and she has day and night shifts. I also have to take care of the children. There are high piles of books on the table that have not been graded.</p>
<p>In the evening, I cooked the meal. The short hand pointed between 6 and 7. Ling's mother came back, looking tired. I served her the meal, and she told me an ominous message: she had been laid off by the factory because the sales of cotton yarn were not good and the market price plummeted. A total of dozens of workers were laid off. I fell into a gloomy stream. Counting it up, she worked for a month and twenty-three days and earned a total of forty-nine yuan and two jiao.</p>
<p>November 10th:</p>
<p>September Salary Not Paid</p>
<p>Principal has not come for a long time. Every morning when I am about to go to school, I first pay attention to his car in front of the door. However, I never see that shadow, and what I get is empty disappointment. November is almost halfway over, and the September salary is still waiting for him to issue. What is the use of issuing only more than thirty yuan?</p>
<p>December 6th:</p>
<p>Birthday Gift Certificate Ten Yuan</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the teaching affairs meeting was held. The chairman was Mr. Li, the director of teaching affairs.</p>
<p>He reported: "December 10th is Principal's fortieth birthday. How should we celebrate?"</p>
<p>After much discussion, Mr. Wang, the director of moral education, passed the method, and everyone presented a gift certificate of ten yuan. My heart was a little uneasy. Adding my thoughts, ten yuan, such a large amount, is not easy to raise in four days. However, this is the principal, unlike others. If you don't go, your ears won't be　, and your eyes won't be blind. It's always outrageous. To be more honest: he has power, and you are always a little teacher under his control.</p>

<h3>A Record of Two Talents from the Opera School</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Hall Owner</p>
<p>After Ye Shengzhang, the "Ruyi Society" Takes Over</p>
<p>Ye Shengzhang's show at the Golden Grand Theatre will continue for half a month, until the 15th of this month, when it will end. After the expiration, he will take his team back north. The new act for the later period has already been decided: the graduates' troupe of the Opera School—namely the "Ruyi Society" led by female Xun Huisheng Li Yuru—will be able to set off south around the 18th. After resting for a few days, they will be allowed to perform on stage during the abolished Western New Year. In addition to the protagonists Li Yuru, as well as the martial actor Wang Jinlu, the Laosheng Zhao Jinnian, the Xiaosheng Chu Jinpeng, the Laodan Li Jinquan, the Jingjiao Zhao Deyu, and the Xiaochou Zhang Jinliang, the company has more than eighty members in total, and the strength of the lineup is even more abundant than that of the Fu Society. Here, the achievements of Li Yuru and Wang Jinlu are briefly recorded below to serve as an introduction.</p>
<p>Li Yuru Those who discuss drama and art all hold the theory of talent and art. Observing the achievements of Li Yuru of the Opera School in acting further confirms this. Yuru's face can be like an eight-sided mirror hall, each with its own voice and appearance. The performance of the seven emotions is clear as a picture, and the authenticity of the drama is perfect in every detail. Performing "Jade Lion Falls," "Battle of Wancheng," "Meilong Town" and all Huadan plays is like preserving the essence of a fragrant rubbing; the singing of Qingyi has a throat that spits pearls and teeth that wash jade; the martial arts and swordsmanship are like the double wings of a colorful phoenix, no different from being born. The recent new dramas "Three Women's Glamour," "Mermaid," and "Amber Bead" all have unique features. It is truly a talented artist who is proficient in both civil and martial arts, and whose singing and acting are equally wonderful. There can only be one, not two.</p>
<p>Wang Jinlu Among the Opera School, Wang Jinlu is the first to be promoted besides Yuru. Jinlu works in both civil and martial arts, loose and martial, and the martial arts include both the Huang and Yang schools. All are imitated very closely. For a time, the reputations of Little Yang, Little Lou, and Little Huang Yueshan all gathered in one person. Recently, he has devoted himself to the Red Sheng plays, and his performances of "Walking Maicheng," "Single Knife Meeting," and "Baima Slope" are a sensation. He is a leader among martial arts actors.</p>
<h3>Willow in Chang'an</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>(8) An Unexpected Guest</p>
<p>In the world, whether people are loyal, treacherous, virtuous, or unworthy, is originally to be decided when the coffin is closed, and no one can predict what will happen later. It is because of mediocre talents and wavering minds that they often cannot grasp the critical moment. Mencius said, "Formerly, he would not accept it even if he died for the sake of his body, but now he does it for the beauty of palaces..." He also said, "This is called losing one's original mind." If a person loses his original mind, he will be at the end of his rope, act perversely, and do everything that is shameless, unfaithful, and unjust. Qian Muzhai was a literary man of his generation, a cabinet minister and a tomb keeper, but he was unable to help the country in distress, which was already a disservice to the country. If he had always listened to Lady Liu's words and died for the sake of martyrdom, although he could not be compared with Shi Kefa and Zhang Huangyan, he would not have been unworthy of his ministerial integrity and would have left a good name. It was only because he was not determined and hesitated that not only did he not die, but also when the Qing army established Jiangnan and carried out county administration, he forgot the oath he had made with Liu Rushi before. He was surrounded by a group of people who were blinded by wealth and signed the surrender document with them, becoming the second Qiao Zhou. Muzhai's behavior allowed him to preserve his life and property, but his integrity fell to the ground, and one wrong step led to eternal regret, even if he washed it with the clear waters of the Yangtze River. Liu Rushi, who was loyal, chaste, and had a manly spirit, was so angry that her face was haggard, her heart was depressed, and she lay down in bed, feeling despondent and sick. She had quarreled with Muzhai several times for his loss of integrity, but it was useless, how could she not be angry to death? She was sick for several months, and all her thoughts were gone. During her illness, Mu Xinchao accompanied her day and night, personally taking care of her medicine, and using many good words to earnestly comfort her and flatter her. It can be said that he did not take off his clothes or blink his eyes, and even a son's service to his parents was no more than this. Although Liu Rushi hated him, she felt a little unbearable to see him, a man over sixty years old, taking care of himself so laboriously and tiredly. So she asked Muzhai to take good care of himself and not be too hard. Shouzhai was still wholehearted and took care of her with the utmost care. (28)</p>
<h3>The View of Life of Struggle (2)</h3>
<p>The life of struggle, on the surface, is very hard, but the rich and valuable experience of life is obtained from struggle, the value of life is expressed from struggle, and all the civilizations of the world are products of struggle, so I should not be afraid of struggle, but be happy to struggle.</p>
<h3>After Watching "Mulan"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Tingyun</p>
<p>Everyone knows that "Hua Mulan" is a heroine who joined the army for her father. The Mulan poem "Clang clang again clang clang" is sung passionately on everyone's lips. The whole play is adapted from this poem in general. The first act shows Hua Mulan's father, Hua Gu, who, although he is over the age of military service, is happy to respond to the conscription order issued by the authorities. He believes that if he does not resist, he will have to kowtow to others and recognize the thief as his father, and always kneel down. Moreover, a soldier should die on the battlefield covered in horsehide, gloriously, and must not die in bed. However, he was finally persuaded by his daughter, who was old and weak, to join the army for his father. However, because she was a woman, she had to dress up as a man and sing the military song heroically. The most shameful thing is that Wu Chengxin, who is greedy for life and afraid of death and shrinks back, actually tries all kinds of methods to prepare to avoid military service. He does not even think that when his homeland becomes a battlefield, how can he survive? The second and third acts are the struggle between justice and rebellion. Zhang Ming actually wanted to unite with Wu Chengxin to open the city gate privately to surrender, and even used threats and inducements to deal with Hua Mulan to make her submit. Finally, he ended his ugly history with a cold arrow flying from outside the city. At this time, the commander-in-chief Xin Ping did not listen to her proposal to hold on and wait for reinforcements, and died in battle by welcoming the enemy with the city. Helplessly, Hua Mulan took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and led the troops to kill out, "Those who are unwilling to be prisoners, follow me and kill!" Under the rush of iron and blood, the final victory was achieved. The last act is that Hua Mulan returned to the capital and was received in the Golden Palace. The left servant Yang Suo and the right servant Su Wei had a tongue-in-cheek battle, focusing on whether the commander-in-chief was dead and did not obey the emperor's orders, and should be severely punished for leading the troops to kill the enemy, and whether the incident should be given preferential treatment and should be commended. However, she alone held great ambitions and took the country as the premise, and declined the position of servant in the Ministry of War.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, Tang Ruoqing's Hua Mulan is enough to show her heroic spirit, and her sword dance with Hua Gu (played by Shi Hui) is quite wonderful. Ge Xin's Zhang Ming fully expresses a treacherous face. In terms of script, it is tense and enthusiastic, and the control is very even. It is that some unnecessary jokes in the fourth act seem superfluous. It is better to change it to Mulan returning home, with the elders and sisters of the villagers welcoming her and congratulating her on her victorious return, which is more appropriate. I wonder what Gao Ming thinks?</p>
