<p>路透社十七日東京電首相東條今晨在貴族院作二十五分鐘之致詞、謂就已往之經騐而論、殊難預料日美談判之結果、政府因此乃決心採取各種必要計畫、以實現日本堅決之政策、日本與美政府續作外交談判、實圖淸除第三國阻撓對華事件程序之企圖·結束敵對行動如諸外國加於日本之經濟封鎖之類·恢復國際正常經濟關係•並竭力阻止歐戰延至遠東、如外交努力得吿成、此三鵠的則不特日本為之欣慰、而亦足造成東亞與世界之和平、惟就已往經騐觀之、談判之結果、仍在未定之天、政府預知置於其途中之梗阻、故決心以各種準備保障日本帝國之生存而不遺餘力、以求積極實行已定之國策、繼檢討</p>
<p>北方局勢　謂自德蘇戰事於六月間開始後、令人慮及其將來變化之可能性、日本對此發展不能漠然置之、政府有鑒於此、今正取各種必要計畫、以保北方之安謐、關於南方之局勢、首相述及日軍之和平開入越南北部、日越巳締結經濟協定、泰越巳調解　界爭端、日越巳成立密切和諧之關係、日本已開始對南方作和平之前進、惟英美荷印之軍事經濟合作巳見增强、日本與荷印之經濟談判巳吿失敗、大局實含有對南太平洋日本地位嚴重威脅、日本因此乃與維希政府締造共防</p>
<p>越南協定　、按照該協定，日本得於七月下旬遺派援軍開入越南南部、惟英美荷印對此合法的自衛計劃、深滋疑懼、於是乃凍結各該國日人之資產、終乃藉完全之禁運、實行經濟封鎖、同時並迅速擴大其反日軍事計劃、夫在非交戰國間實行經濟封鎖、而成其敵對性質不亞於武裝作戰計劃、實難令人索解、此種行動不特阻碍日本所欲吿成中國事件之解決、且大足影響日本帝國之生存、因此日本決不能予以容忍、雖然、日本恒切欲和平之保全、故不恤作至大之努力、藉外交談判以消除此危機、俾大局得獲和平之解決、但日本之期望卒未實現、帝國乃不得不應付嚴重之局勢、而須決定今後數代所取之方針，東條繼乃述及</p>
<p>對華戰事　、謂解決戰事之工作巳入最後階段、惟援助蔣介石將軍之各國之經濟軍事活動已日見積極、此為重慶抗戰能力最後所餘之柱石、而良足阻撓中國事件之成功的結束、東條末乃對滿洲國與南京政府恒與日本合作、表示深切之感忱、並歡賀各友邦之成績、尤其為德義兩國者、謂日本希望此諸國能吿成勝利、而與日本帝國依據公道奠定世界之新程序，</p>
<p>外相演辭</p>
<p>謂日本雖努力趨向和好、吿成日美之談判、但吾人和緩之態度當然有一限度、如一旦發生足以威脅帝國生存、或危害日本為一大强國之威望之情勢、則日本必須以堅毅之態度應付之、此為無庸贅言者、日美談判已歷續六月之久、故今後無浪費更多時間之必要、如美政府誠心欲保全世界之和平、如日本然、了解日本天然之需要、與其在東亞之地位、並就現實考慮日本今處之局勢、則和好之結局非絕不可能、談話現仍在進行中，惟渠不能發表談話之詳情、日本除求於中國戰事獲成功之結局外，且其關切北境與南海之局勢、日蘇之中立協定即因此而締結、以期保全北境之安謐、德蘇兩國間雖發生戰爭、但日本仍竭力維持保全北境安謐之政策、日本決心用種種方法、阻止似足擾害北境和平的因素之發生、不寗唯是、且圖阻止足以威脅日本權益的局勢之發展、外相繼述及日本與越泰之友好關係、謂第三國之惡意的宣傳、謂日本謀於該一地作侵略的企圖、此實至足令人扼腕、當日軍依照聯防協定開入越南南部時、英美視此為威脅彼等之領土、於是乃凍結其國中日人之資產、此舉等於斷絕經濟關係之計劃、英美並誘引澳洲荷印加入對日之包圍、故日本當前之局勢現日見緊張、反日之壓力已成眞正嚴重問題、日本今遭空前之困難局勢、故全國急當團結而加入軍隊、以應付日本歷史上最危急之時代、</p>
<h3>賀屋藏相報告　財政狀况　四年侵華戰費達四十八億元</h3>

<h3>撲滅肺癆運動</h3>
<p>上海防癆協會為求全市健康幸福起見，倡導撲滅肺癆，於此一週內，舉行擴大宣傳募捐運動，儗醵資一百萬元，建築大規模防癆醫院。此一舉措，關係整個社會福祉與人類健康者至鉅，吾人熱望其早日成功，同時更籲請各界予以廣泛之同情援助。</p>
<p>根據兩租界衛生當局統計，在一九四零年一年中，死於肺癆者凡三千七百餘人，預計今年死亡額，或將超過六千人之數；至於未經醫治或未獲報吿以及在租界以外之華人區域患同樣病症與死亡者，更不可勝計。又據海深德醫師之約略估計，目前滬市市民之患肺結核應入醫院者，至少有五萬四千人，患有肺癆而未覺察者，至少有百分之八—換言之，卽上海四百萬人口中，有三十二萬人日在肺癆侵襲之中。</p>
<p>這樣一個可驚的數目，實不容吾人再事徘徊，再事猶豫，必須竭盡智能，將這無形的大敵，迅速撲滅。世人嘗有諱疾忌醫的惡劣習性，對於個人的健康，向不重視，甚至以診療疾病為可厭，至於每年從事身體檢查，預防疾患的侵襲，那更是絕無僅有的事。一旦病魔纏擾，方始惶急就醫，這其間時間上的耽誤，影響到生理上的變化，往往因小病而成為大病，因大病而診斷貽誤，結果將寳貴的生命，輕輕送掉，這是極普通而又極可悲慘的事。除諱疾忌醫者外，尚有許多貧困的人，因無力就醫的綠故，根本不知所患為何病，而普通所謂施診給藥的慈善醫院，輙以病人表面所呈的現象，作為診察的根據，視若輕微，予以不對症的藥餌，其實患病者的嚴重情狀，診視者或尚未完全淸楚，於是又因蹉跎延誤，不可救治，每年像這樣情形而喪失生命者，又不知有若干千萬人。所以我們固然竭力擁護撲滅肺癆，同時更建議以十二分的力量去從事防癆，如早期檢查的施行，隔離療養的設備，均應從速舉辦，庶幾防患於未然，消弭於無形；而最急切的工作，是在於廣泛宣傳，使肺癆之危險印象，入於每個人之心坎中。</p>
<p>至就撲滅肺癆運動的意義言，則所關於國家社會者，至深且鉅，蓋此項舉措，從捎極方面說，是恢復個人健康，從積極方面說，卽是加强國家力量。患肺病者因獲得適當治療而延長其生命，其個人必能多成就若干事業，對國家必能多作若干貢獻，假定一人能獲得多餘之工作一年，則一萬人可有一萬年之成就，其影響於國力者為何如？故撲滅防癆運動，母寗謂為加强國力運動！</p>
<p>吾人更應深切體認，凡事涉及社會公衆者，必與任何人有利害切身的關係，防癆運動，卽其一端。撲滅社會的大敵，卽所以保衛自己的家庭，吾人必以全力，予以援助。防癆協會諸君此次肩承了造福羣衆的偉大義舉，其一切組織，非常健全而公開，為使各方捐款能涓滴歸公起見，所有一切宣傳及因募捐上所必需的費用，都由工作人員自己擔任，像這樣純潔的善念，必可激起社會問潛在的無限同情心，更可樹立辦理慈善事業的良好模範。吾人瞻望不久的將來，偉大的肺癆醫院，必以簇新的科學化設備，與社會相見；而整個上海肺癆的肅淸，已於此時植其丕基。</p>
<h3>農業生產與民族經濟</h3>
<p>民族經濟之基礎世人嘗以為繫於工業，是故一切經濟問題之能否為適當解決胥視工業發展之程序為準繩，循此邏輯而言，工業果能獲致合理之發展，則民族經濟基礎之奠定自可迎刃而解。此工業之重要固無可非議。第不知卽有飛機大砲之國防工業與夫滿足生活上物質享受之新奇出品企業，而無農　之給養與能果腹而維持活力之生命要素，則前者亦將無用武之地，是以農業之重要並不亞於工業。</p>
<p>雖然，凡國防工業與製造業發達之國家自可以其固有之出品以易他國之農產，但就國家民族立塲觀之，各國無不積極謀完成其全部之經濟機構而求獨立生存之道。列强之扶植農業生產為經濟基礎者比比皆是。美國為世界最大之工業國，而其經濟基礎仍建築於農業生產，故其社會經濟之盛衰，全視農業之興替為轉移。英國夙執世界工業之牛耳，但仍有賴於農業之補苴，因此廣拓屬地，以農業為中心支撑而完成其經濟給養網。蘇俄近數年來工業之突飛猛晋固為舉世矚目，而其農業生產之進步，亦已迭建世界紀錄，且已確立為蘇俄經濟之基礎矣。德國幅圓狹小而偏重工業，惟是農業生產之缺乏，構成德國經濟之嚴重罅隙，因此在平時採用種種方式以獲致各國農產之接濟，而此次甘為第二世界大戰之戎首，亦由於亟須為其人民謀生活之出路也。</p>
<p>農業生產之重要旣如上述，我人自不難設想各國政府如何重視農業生產之分配與消費問題。平時農產物之售價，旣無狂漲暴落之動盪而得保證人民均等享受之權利，在戰時則由政府予以嚴厲之統制，關於個人或家庭消費皆由政府按照規定售價支配之，是以絕無厚此薄彼之弊病。但此皆為最低限度之設施，蘇俄徳意等國不啻視農產物為第二生命，且與飛機大砲相比擬，今將德國之農產政策，略舉二，以明眞相。</p>
<p>溯自納粹秉政後，德國之糧食政策卽仿照蘇俄之用為政治武器。舉凡欲喚醒民族之團結，督促農民之合作，監視製造業之合理施工，改變沉湎於奢侈生活人民之習慣，與夫推行一般之內政問題，無不藉此糧食武器之供給與否為之先導。凡犯罪而屢戒不悛者，卽予以停止供給糧食之處分，凡有成就或功績者，則增加其糧食供給，以為獎勵。</p>
<p>就經濟觀點言，納粹糧食政策之革命足徵其認識農業生產之重要。自一九三四年起，納粹仿行墨索里尼之政策而開始其生產戰爭，先减少進口，再將糧食售價提高，經售商之利得抑低，因此消費者之負祖略為增加，而經商者之利得則大為减少，故國內農產發展之利得，，自屬諾政府。所有農業與農業有關之製造業皆經縝密之研究而予以澈底之改造；無論農民，勞動者，糧食經售商或牛乳零售商號，皆編為納粹糧臺之士卒而為政府推行此糧食新政。迨此糧政革命完成後，再推行試騐改革飮食習慣與烹飪方法，經第一流之經濟家，食物營養家與心理學家之會同研究後卽制定每個人之糧食消費數量，而以此制定糧食單位交與人民試騐。自一九三九年九月一日納粹向波蘭宣戰後，德國人民卽一律實行是項糧食單位消費，迄今絕不稍懈，此乃納粹解決糧食缺乏之方法，觀其用心，亦復良苦。</p>
<p>我國號稱以農立國而民食尚不能自給自足，自屬莫大遺憾，為懲前毖後並揆諸世界大勢，我國自最適宜於興辦農業，蓋農業較易奏功；工業自可並行不悖，但我人不可抱過奢之希望，蓋從民族經濟立塲言，我人急應先振興農業以鞏固共基礎而後始可再作他圖。</p>
<p>昨報載農民銀行將收買大地主之田地而轉租與佃農耕種，是為實行總理平均地權遺敎之先聲，凡屬國民，固無不擁護。顧我人於此時敢進一言者，是項田地分租與佃農耕種後，政府仍須負指導與扶植之責任，而必須表演最高效率生產之結果與鞏固民族經濟之基礎為噶矢。換言之，政府推行是項地權新政，則政府自應負起責任而完成其使命。</p>
<p>歐戰　談</p>
<h3>法國政界的女禍</h3>
<p>海倫所最切望者，是想把她和她戀人的命運打成一片。這時萊諾和她的妻子，海倫和飽爾特伯爵，皆已分離。萊諾的妻子應募為傘兵看護，飽爾特伯爵則巳奉召入伍。</p>
<p>萊諾和海倫兩人同居於蒲爾彭宮，恰在下議院對面。可是萊諾的妻子不願離婚，按照法國的法律，在如此情形之下，除非能證明夫婦分居巳在三年以上，不准再婚。海倫很想修改這條法律，可惜有權改變法律的祇有司法部長，而那時候的司法部長恰是萊諾本人，若非罔顧廉恥，他決不能自動加以修改。</p>
<p>海倫一點也不躊躇，立刻去見她的勁敵克魯沙侯爵夫人，對她說：「假使你要萊諾放棄他營謀總理的野心，假使你要達拉第給他個職位，使他更能効勞法國，我們就應讓他做財政部長，現在的財政部長馬尚陶，庸懦無能，又是個贊成慕尼黑政策的人。彭奈已不做外交部長，達拉第可以繼起負責，而油彭奈擔任司法部長。這樣的一個內閣，必能維持較久。」</p>
<p>克魯　侯爵夫人帶着海倫去見達拉第，這個新部署便諒解成立了。</p>
<p>彭奈被任為司法部長後，海倫立刻去見她的朋友彭奈夫人，說道：萊諾和你的丈夫應該言歸於好，明天萊諾將為總理，他要撤回彭奈，使他掌理司法職。不過現在我要彭奈替我做一樁事，他應該把離婚律修改一下。」</p>
<p>彭奈就任司法部長之後，他第一個新猷，就是把離婚後再婚的期限，從三年减至一年</p>
<p>達拉第感到頭痛了，保羅萊諾的一舉一動，好像他就要做總理似的，他看見許多政敵集矢於現內閣。和他合作的人却批評政府首領的措置失當。萊諾借着海倫家裏，歡宴各軍事重要人物，即如達拉第的軍事參議院秘書長特康將軍，和主採攻勢者希望所寄的季勞特將軍，皆在被邀之列。</p>
<p>侯爵夫人打電話給伯爵夫人，要她解釋眞相。海倫立刻往見達拉第，她的托辭是很別續的，她說：一保羅的舉動若果有違約之處，那趁因為他的環境惡劣，不得不然。你應該逼他撤去他的秘書長巴留斯基。」</p>
<p>於是海倫便乘機拔去了她的眼中釘，那是她最利害的敵人，他與萊路合作巳有一十年之久，對於那位漂亮的伯爵夫人，是始終反對的。</p>
<p>海倫立刻把這位置給與她的兩個心腹—雷加和特孚。</p>
<p>海倫巳佈置一切。萊諾必須做到總理。芬蘭戰事以後，他果然如願以償了，陸軍部長一職，則仍由達拉第連任。</p>
<p>海倫不再隱身幕後了。現在她　自在蒲爾彭宮和總理官邸接見賓客。她巳獨行其是了</p>
<p>某次內閣會議，達拉第消極抵抗萊諾政見。他和甘茂林表示同意，不肯出兵挪威。他的足骨折斷巳久，他即以此為藉口，而不肯親赴倫敦，署名於英法不得單獨媾和的條約，那是在四月四日訂立的。</p>
<p>迨至五月十日，德軍突然進迫，攻破防綫，使法國參謀本部和政府當局大起恐慌。我們應該原諒海倫，承認她並未偷閒享樂，她每天起床二十小時，往來奔走，照顧萊諾的健康，反對各部長離開巴黎，並主張撤換甘茂林和達拉第，而代之以　當魏剛。</p>
<p>萊諾本人頗望他的老友特、戈爾將軍出任軍事委員會委員長一職。遠自一九三六年起，特戈爾即不時以軍事文獻供給萊諾，後來無不一一應騐。可是海倫却堅稱他在前綫當更有益於國家，他曾指揮法國戰車隊，早巳聲譽卓著了。</p>
<p>海倫却以此任付之維爾呂默上校，此人是她會客廳中的有名軍官，也是失敗主義的有名人物。</p>
<p>德軍繼續前進。總理的整個時間，都消磨在海倫陰謀之中，她的神機妙算，愈出愈奇，她把强硬主張抵抗的外交部秘書雷瑞撤換，而以她最要好的朋友，素以恐英病聞名的鮑多恩榮膺外交部長。</p>
<p>其次就把她的子女由保姆護送到美國。</p>
<p>這時德軍全綫猛進，法軍望風而潰，政府撤離了都爾，海倫和總理寸步不離，有人要去見他，便得先去見她。</p>
<p>悲慘的末日到了。傾向停戰和主張繼續作戰的人，展開了一慕激烈的辯論。</p>
<p>萊諾是堅主繼續作戰的。</p>
<p>德軍愈　迫近。都爾巳被轟炸，政府不得不遷至波爾多了，海倫放棄一切媚惡的手段，她並不修飾，常穿着一件藍紫色衣服，奔走各地。她催促萊諾　位給貝當和飽多恩。</p>
<p>她允許萊諾可得駐美大使一席，他的名字巳向華盛頓提出，在七月十六日的晚上十點鎮，萊諾終於答應了，原來海倫對他說：一致了紐約，我們便可結婚了。</p>
<p>她偉大的冒險事業並未成功，可是她並沒有放棄一切。</p>
<p>七月二十二日，停戰協定成立的那一天，雷加和特孚突於西班牙被捕。他們是萊諾的同志，也是海倫的好友。她曾經鼓動鮑多恩，派一個做駐美財政參贊，一個做法國駐紐約購買委員會的主任，主持淸算事宜。</p>
<p>雷加和特孚是負着外交使命的，西班牙衛兵却佯為不知，照例搜查他們的行李，結果除重要的外交文件之外，並搜出珠寳，公債和價値兩百萬元的金子。聖西撥斯丁的法國領事，立刻接到了下面的通吿：　、據雷加和特孚的說明，這是鮑爾特伯爵夫人的私人產業，至於二百萬元的金子，則是政府的秘密基金，預備在美國做官傳費的。</p>
<p>金子由馬德里的法國大使遵海道運回法國。外交文件則於兩星期後歸還。</p>
<p>萊諾的任命本巳由白宮接受，這時却立被打消了。</p>
<p>當時萊諾方與海倫首途往法國南部。在半路上得到雷加和特孚被捕的消息。（兩人後夾准赴葡萄牙，再轉往英國）</p>
<p>六月二十七日，萊諾在聖馬西看望過他的女兒之後，便和海倫在一家餐館中會晤。他們都感到心緒惡劣。海倫親自駕車，一小時後，汽車撞在一根電話桿上，發現時海倫已死，萊諾亦受重傷。</p>
<p>這是偶然的意外嗎，是受了的暗算嗎？是故意自殺嗎，我們殆將永不能知了，</p>
<p>那個在法國號稱「傾國聖母」的女人，便這樣結束了她一生的冒險事業。</p>
<p>至於其他幾位英雌，亦暫時歛跡。我們僅知勃萊蒂依然忠事芒台爾，留居里奧姆，一有機會，便到獄中探望這位前任的部長。在那裹她也可以遇見甘茂林。</p>
<p>至於克魯沙侯爵夫人，却未看望過達拉第一次。萊諾包紮着頭，獨自一個幽禁於古堡裹，天天沉浸在熱戀的回憶，和失敗的創痕之中。</p>

<p>衆業公所股市、兎起鶻落、極盡變幻之能事、開盤價未如週杪一般人意料而大跌、所落不足百分之十、蓋多方之恐懼、業隨二日來其他市塲之穩定而漸次消失、故開後不久、買氣重振、市况反跌為漲、迄午收時、各股價格、馴至超越上週五收價、午後終因所漲太過而吿回落、但潛勢尚堅、</p>
<h3>傳銀行停做押款　黃金跌風驟起</h3>
<p>昨日現金熗赤暗市、反動驟起跌風、價巳退入二萬元大關內、因盛傳銀行停做黃金押款、以津輪被海關抄獲金條、證實有黃金運滬、津港兩幫吐售甚殷、故銀行幫仍進提拉、市價仍由二萬一千元、數次跌近一萬九千元關、最低一萬九千一百元、終狂跌一千六百元、各方人心甚虛軟、全日交易一萬三千四百兩、飾金軋小六十元、計二千元、紋銀掛低二元、為二十六元、暗市已降至二十三元四角、</p>
<p>現金進二萬元關</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）在公和等賣勢中、」時缺少買戶、市價竟由二萬一千一百元、　撳低至二萬元關口始成交開市、比上週六午收軋小一千三百元、開後始見天元·明豐·大豐買進、致回漲亦鋭、一刹那步升一千元、達二萬一千元、奈人心不振、及見天元復出、時和·義豐·永成·祥和亦來吐售、後明豐亦賣、價越盤越小、跌至一萬九千一百元、雖見德成·立泰·明豐·天元·進提升至一萬九千五百元、時和售出、午收一萬九千三百元、收後退至一萬九千一百五十元、最後一萬九千二百元、下午二點開市一萬九千四百五十元、計開高一百五十元、次為一萬九千五百元、祥和·順源來力售、小至一萬九千二百元、明豐·大豐·德孚見低進抬、步升五百五十元、達一萬九千七百五十元、四點收市一萬九千七百元、比上週六午收軋小一千穴百元、當日有九百元高低、現金號之本牌金、門市售價一萬九千九百元、收進比售出低二百元、</p>

<h3>黑匯消滅　私人劃帳交易有賣出無買戶</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐與中央掛牌均平、滙豐等小櫃　價勿更、英美滙黑黑市業已正式完全消滅、無價無市、僅聞在紐約劃帳者、某華人掮客美滙喊三元有供售、而英滙二辦士一二五（亦在美國劃帳）有賣戶、均無對軋買戶、終日未做開、</p>

<h3>各項物價統制聲中　棉紗仍鬧漲停板</h3>
<p>連跌幾日之紗市、昨則反動回好、但實際交易依然沉寂、實緣雙馬廠單比高峯時已回下有八百元外、又引起獲利人扒補、檯面一緊、市盤迅速回昂、二十支雙馬最高價為二千六百四十元、低價為二千四百十元、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市塲人心大都看好、首盤即高二三十元、為二千五百十元、少頃漲至二千五百四十五元、高盤一現後、引起套賣者活躍、取引所開盤亦疲、賣氣較盛、市盤叉復回鬆至二千四百五十元、二盤取引所忽然上升、人心隨之帶昂、漲出五百元關外、豈料三收盤籃鳳又見回挫、人氣跟疲、又跌至二千四百五十五元、、不料時近十一時半、塲中貿風忽熾、塲內買手頗衆、市盤直升至二千五百六十元、收盤價為二千五百三十八元、查上午半日間成交三千八百包、</p>
<p>午後初開價為二千五百二十元、繼後因檯面上賣戶寥寥、且進者極夥、籌碼見枯、　之取引所紗布市况直綫上騰、人心愈挺、市盤乃扶搖直上至二千六百四十元、宜吿漲停板、塲外最後價為二千六百十五元云、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市况、經連續下跌後、價已降至相當低盤、雖國際間趨勢之緊張、多屬利空消息、是以多方恐慌之下殊難支撑、先後出籠、昨市雖有美軍撤防與其他不良之謠諑、乃市態斤直趨上漲、蓋以市價過低、引起投機之進襲、午後廠單猛升停板、而期紗遠期亦均升二百元之多、當晨開近期為二二六〇元、先漲三十五元、入後微降至二一九五元乃叉立即上升至二千三百元、午收十二月二三八〇元開出、亦一度略小、俄又漲至二四九〇元、午收遠期二四八元做開、冉冉而上達二五七〇元、下午以流言好轉、人心大都興奮、期紗憑藉廠單之上升、證金兩幫居多牧進、故各月份均幾近高價牧盤、結果十一月份上漲一百八十五元、十二月份軋好二百元、一月份亦升二百元、茲列表於後、</p>

<h3>棉價轉穩</h3>
<p>昨日現棉情况、隨紗市而稍見穩定、交易略有做開、惟價格較週前約小五十元左右、至午後因有謠風利多、紗布價格、復見趨升、人心振興、</p>
<p>蘭宮二〇〇件五五〇·〇號家又一〇〇件五五〇·〇又</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因同業買進而漲、續後又因紐輿倫斯售出、及多頭了結回跌、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲跌五六磅音不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因職業商賣出、及多頭了結而跌、繼之又因其他植物原料、如胡麻·亞麻等市塲堅昂而略漲、但最後市况、仍因浮多吐售、再接再厲而跌、昨日收盤價格、各跌一羅比左右、又預測今日開盤市况看跌〇·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>疋頭蠢然思逞</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市展開平平、午後回漲、乃因人心稍定、新多及空頭抵補雙管齊下、結果白貨粗細布斜紋漲每疋三元至五元、漂染布亦漲五元左右、本街染廠及批發號落手採辦、下午交易更盛、成交六百餘件、客幫辦去三百餘件、係心思交易、</p>
<p>東布　昨市隨紗升騰、反動殊烈、取引所各月份標布激漲每疋六元〇一分至六元二角、、現貨市塲之龍頭細布與四君子嗶　、則先跌後漲、鋒銳異常、下午龍頭廠單收盤為九十二元、較上週末回升七元之譜、四君子嗶嘰晨盤最小價做三元〇三分、午後猛抬至三元四角一分半、收盤回至三元三角七分、</p>
<h3>公賣米續有到　洋粉更乏精神</h3>

<p>昨米市塲除國米交易漸見加多外、洋米交易依然全部停頓、須待工部局指示辦法後方能恢復正常交易、</p>
<p>粉昨日愈見疲滯無神、因北洋幫日前辦存之洋粉數十萬包均無工部局簽發出境證而未克啓裝、客幫方面不獨乏進、反有求售意、至於本街除少數必需外、大部份守候平粉公賣後添辦、故金龍牌降開三十六七元後仍祗少數點綴、大戶則貶價至三十五元仍乏受主、按金龍脾最高開六十元、以三十五元計、巳跌落百分之四十一有奇、惟麩皮小麥均以缺貨見站、小包麩實銷開五十四元、又回砌半元云、</p>
<h3>油市躉批缺少</h3>

<p>十七日進口豆子五千五百六十包、生仁一千八百五十包、均天津來、</p>
<h3>橘餅獻新</h3>
<p>橘餅前以陳坯吿罄、久無到貨、故中秋北幫需要甚急、竟無貨可辦、茲値產區見新、首批巳有數十件運申試市、昨聞已開出比陳貨高起百數元、</p>

<h3>動物的舊式武器</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>處身在這生存競爭的世界戰塲上，一種動物，要是不想種類滅絕的話，勢必其備着一種優越的武器，無論是為侵略用的抑或是為防禦用的。牠們這些五花八門的種種武器，實在說並無所謂新式舊式的分別，强分為新舊的，也只是拿我們自己的眼光衡量罷了。我現在揀幾種有趣味的寫在下邊，至於那虎爪，狼牙，馬蹄，牛角，……當然是舉不勝舉的。</p>
<p>長槍</p>
<p>在北極海中，有一種名叫「一角」的鯨類動物：牠身長一丈六七尺，形狀像魚，色灰白，背與脅上有無數的斑點。然而最奇特的，却是雄性上脣所仲出的一根長槍，——牙！——這根槍長約八九尺，屬象牙質，細膩堅固，挺然直前，而槍桿上還裝飾着向左紐旋的繩樣的花紋！這東西有什麼用呢，要是不為的戰鬥？所以我說這是一位執長槍的戰士。</p>
<p>大鋸</p>
<p>在地中海或大西洋中，生着一種怪狀的屬於鯊魚科的「鋸魚」，也叫「鋸鯊」。這傢伙長約兩丈，背茶色而微紅胸鰭腹鰭全非常闊大。可是頂叫人驚奇的，却是牠那變形的長嘴：這嘴能長到六尺餘，扁平，上下兩方排列着無數整齊而巉銳的利齒，你說這不是一把大鋸又是什麽？十九世紀初的一位名叫Lacepede的法國自然科學家，曾描述過牠攻擊鯨魚的故事，也可想見牠的利害了！</p>
<p>擁劍</p>
<p>螃蟹强有力的武器，就是第一對前足所變成的擰住就死不肯放鬆的鉗子，所謂「蟹螯」，也就是現在人常說的那「鉗形攻勢」。可是有一種黃褐色只兩寸大小的小螃蟹，其雄性的一螯偏長，能到兩三寸：左思賦注語上說它說「其利如劍」，所以叫作「擁劍」。段成式的酉陽雜俎上說，牠的兩螯「以大者鬥，以小者食」。……我們尋以想像這擁劍的英雄在水中揮劍作戰時應該是多麽威風吧！</p>
<p>執斧</p>
<p>爾雜上說：螳螂，有斧蟲」。宋人陸佃解釋說：「兗人謂之「巨斧」，其臂如斧，奮之常轍不避……」再根據法國昆蟲專家發布兩的描寫：螳螂前肢當中作梭形的那一節，實在是鋸齒作兩層排列的一面大鋸；外層鋸齒四枚，內層鋸齒十二枚，黑長綠短，長短相間，更有三枚尖長之針殿後。最後一節，也是兩層鋸齒的鋸，不過其齒更小更稠密罷了。肢端更伸着枚尖和彎曲的鐮刀。所以螳螂用前肢去鈞撈，鑽刺，割裂，撕扯，眞是一種完善而利害的武器，法布爾說螳螂是和平昆蟲界中的兇虎，惡魔！再據湯姆生的話：在南美洲的螳螂，其力量有眞能捕捉一隻小鳥的！</p>
<p>射取</p>
<p>在海洋浮游生物中，有一種無色而細長的棒狀小蟲，長約二公分半，頭部生有剛毛小棘，軀幹左右兩側生有側鰭。這東西不但形狀像箭，就是運動捕食也是突然前進，儼如飛箭離弦一般，所以名叫「箭蟲」：現在拿牠充作弓箭手，或者不算毫無理由吧。</p>
<p>弋獲</p>
<p>「弋」字的定義是：『以繩繫矢而射」。這種武器，也能在動物中尋找出來。譬如那些光怪陸離善於變色的避役們，便每）個具備着一條比身體還長的長舌：平時捲縮了藏在口腔，遇着可獵取的蟲豸，便疾風似的突圍而出，向時叉掣電似的滿戰而歸，因為舌端分泌一種極黏的液體，蟲豸很少能不被牠挾帶而去的。據生物世界的記載；西班牙南部有一種避役，體長只五六寸，可是能用舌攝取八九寸遠的地方的東西，而且來回只須一秒鐘的十分之幾！</p>

<h3>失敗的記錄</h3>
<p>— 菲了</p>
<p>這一位靑年的左脚準備跨上人生的第一步，他的腦膜上畫着一幅美麗的「人生之路」：</p>
<p>藍色的天：一點沒有雨意。</p>
<p>春風吹來，</p>
<p>花草繞着四週：</p>
<p>一條半坦寬廣路。</p>
<p>點綴着快樂，平安，成功</p>
<p>直通到另一端！</p>
<p>他一點不覺得牠的抽衆，他以為確有這麽一條路等着一班幸運者。誰說理想的人生不是人們所該有的呢？</p>
<p>他開步走。</p>
<p>人生的浪，起始打着這位昂着的靑年，他開一下眼，他稍會覺得：不是每一個時間天都是藍的！</p>
<p>再過去一步：</p>
<p>他碰着大山，高薄雲天；他遇到深水，注洋一片，不由得他的脚停下來！</p>
<p>也許他盼望有一架飛機載去，一條汽船渡去，可是；高山吿訴他，成功者是攀着籐枝上去的。</p>
<p>深水吿訴他，成功者是游泳過去的。</p>
<p>力，汗，血，淚，他換取了一個新的認識：</p>
<p>「惟有奮鬬、纔有出路」。</p>
<p>奮鬭，並小是一直勝利的，失敗接連地跟着他，他怨恨失敗，一次，二次，再次，他自餒，他有些消極？</p>
<p>但，常他知道了人生的眞諦，就冉也不討厭失敗，每一個失敗，却作了寳貴的記錄。</p>
<p>——哦，失敗幾次了！不是感歎，乃是歡呼！他甚至會像史蒂爾一般地說：</p>
<p>「疑惑這次的成功是否可靠，因為「失敗」太不够紀錄了！」</p>
<p>他沒有撕毀腦膜上所畫的一幅他說：</p>
<p>「藍天並非沒有，花草的是香艶！</p>
<p>人生的路，是有快樂與平安！</p>
<p>但，這一切是爭取的——奮鬬</p>
<p>更是換取的；</p>
<p>灰色的天，荊棘的路，眼淚汗血</p>
<p>——失敗的紀錄」！</p>
<p>最後，</p>
<p>他以一個譬喩來結束他的人生：</p>
<p>「這一頭駿馬，牠終於勝利了！</p>
<p>但，您可看見牠股間的鞭傷？</p>

<p>但當他回到了所住的那家小客棧以後，他却絕對沒有再淌過一滴淚水，反裝着歡天喜地的模樣，把梅寳替他預備下的一碗湯麵做三四口吃了下去。</p>
<p>「我的人緣倒還不錯，同行對我都是挺和氣的，很願意照應。」他把身子歪在榻上，瞧着正在收拾筷碗的梅寳說。。「只在上海唱戲的人，出了台都愛冒上，我荒了這麼十多年工夫，第一天上去，不免覺得格外累一些。」「希望過幾天就會好起來。」梅寳隨口這樣說。</p>

<h3>寫在鐵扇公主公映前</h3>
<p>— 禮義</p>
<p>中國第一部有聲長篇立體卡通「鐵扇公主」行將公映，這是值得令人興奮的一個消息！籌攝「鐵扇公主」遠在數年前，而攝製工作亦累年經月，竭萬氏兩兄弟，並百二十位術家的心血克底於成；於此亦可見該片的攝製是如何精密，並且如何鄭重！</p>
<p>這是中國影壇的一朶異葩！這是中國影人的一種嘗試，無疑這種新的嘗試决不會失敗。我們承認中國的電影遠比歐美幼稚，但，我們有我們的路，幼稚難道沒有成熟的時候麽</p>
<p>看了「白雪公主」，「木偶奇遇記」，「小人國」等長篇卡通後，縱然不嘆為觀止，至少亦當為電影藝術的有此偉大成就而驚異不置，卡通影片的藝術評價，是應該在普通影片之上的，我們可以這樣說？「鐵扇公主」的成績如何尙未為大衆明悉，但我們想來它決不會使人失望，理由是它不是一部粗製濫造的影片，中國有些影片，往往是組製濫造的產品，這是不能不令人扼捥的！</p>
<p>卡通片的特別可取點，除畫面動人，音樂悅耳外，似乎是劇情誇張了。因此，取材方面，自以童話之類最為適合，不過，若說攝卡通非童話不可，當然也不見得正確的！於此，我們有一個要求，甚望中國卡通作者予以接受，便是題材固不妨童話之類，但若由於迎合一小部分人士的口味，使內容過度趣味化，遂致失去敎育的意義，那麼這過失決不是藐小的。因為，看卡通片雖不定全是兒童，而兒童的熱愛卡通片則是千眞萬確的。若一張卡通所賜於兒童的僅是「笑笑，喊幾聲好」，這豈不是浪費嗎？當然，一鐵扇公主」決不是這一類影片。</p>
<p>其次，我們希望大上海滬光兩院在公映「鐵扇公主」時，對於兒童有一個特別優待的辦法，切勿如公映「白雪公主」時有「兒童全票」的例外規定，這樣，對於兒童自然有更多之機會。末了，我們除竭誠介紹「鐵扇公主」外，並熱望萬氏兄弟並百二十位藝術家以更大的努力，創造比「鐵扇公主」更偉大的作品來！</p>

<p>為加入革命黨嗎？不，為搶刦趙家嗎？不，為調戲吳媽嗎？也不，何况決沒有被槍斃的道理，大家知道阿Q死了，但不知阿Q為什麽死，罪名何在？陳瑜先生改編的「阿Q正傳」，共分五幕，在第五幕中，更搜羅魯迅先生的「阿Q止傳」外的作品狂人日記」「藥」等穿揷其中，所以對於阿Q本人，倒反易使觀衆輕視過去的，因此也就不明不白死了，雖然，大家都知道，他自己也喊出一聲：二十年後又是一條</p>
<p>「不錯，我知道，搶刦的人，並不是阿Q，不過，唉，趙太爺，不瞞您說，我上任了這許多天，為了這些小事，至今還沒有破案，這樣一來，我</p>
<p>的名譽，豈不是不好聽了嗎？大家該說啦，這個錢所長簡直是一個廢物，連一個小小的村莊的治安，都管理得不妥當，將來還能幹出什麽大事情來？還虧得他花費那許多金錢到外國去學過法政的哩，這一來，唉，趙太爺，你想，豈不是糟糕了嗎？所以，我才挑定了阿Q，來做一個替身——反正這傢伙是一個無家，無室，無依，無靠的那麼一個窮酸的無賴！」</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Northern Hunan, Repelled by Chinese Army; Japanese Troops Completely Cleared from Suburbs of Zhongmou; Guilin Observes Routes of Japanese Invasion of Southwest</h3>
<p>Chongqing Military News On the eighth of this month,   Japanese troops stealthily crossed the Xinqiang River near Tuanzhanggangzui in northern Hunan and advanced towards China. They were repelled by the Chinese army, suffering heavy losses. On the fourteenth, over a thousand Japanese troops advanced towards Koukou (ten miles southwest of Sanshui County) and other places. They were met with resistance by the Chinese army. By the afternoon of the sixteenth, the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and were forced to retreat towards Sanshui. In the Zhongmou area, after the Chinese army entered the city on the fourteenth, it continued to carry out mopping-up operations. By the evening of the fifteenth, the Japanese troops in the suburbs had been completely cleared. The remaining Japanese, entrenched in a corner of the city, were resisting stubbornly, but the Chinese army inflicted heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese were still under heavy attack by Chinese forces. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin Local Chinese circles believe that if the Japanese army invades Yunnan, it will likely launch an offensive on the southwestern front at the same time. It is believed that the Japanese army in Guangzhou may attack Shaoguan along the railway, while another army will land in Beihai to threaten the Guizhou-Guangxi transportation lines. The main force of the Japanese army will advance on Kunming from Vietnam. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Actively Assist the Motherland</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Chicago Chinese leader   Tan, attended a banquet held by Chen Ce and Chen Qingyun tonight. Sun Ke, Vice President Xu, Chong Jiu, Fang Zhenwu, Li Xing   , and over fifty representatives from the press were present. Tan gave a speech, stating that "Although the 3,000 Chinese in Chicago have donated US$1.4 million since the war began, we deeply understand that this is a responsibility that Chinese citizens should bear. We dare not be complacent, because compared to the sacrifices and lives of our compatriots in China, this small donation is insignificant. Even if Japan wins, we overseas Chinese will have no way to contribute, so money is worthless. The oppression of Jewish people around the world serves as a clear example. The sole purpose of money is to assist the motherland and defeat the invaders." He also stated that when the Sino-Japanese War first began, foreigners believed that China could not resist for more than six months. But four years later, China is getting stronger and stronger. This is due to the spirit of unity and cooperation between the soldiers at the front and the people at the rear, as well as their heroic sacrifices. All of these things have greatly inspired overseas Chinese. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Guo Reports on Diplomacy at National Political Council Meeting; Japan Has Not Changed Its Current Policy; No Possibility of Compromise Between the United States and Japan</h3>
<p>Chongqing Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi reported on diplomatic affairs at the National Political Council meeting this afternoon. According to what he told reporters this afternoon, the United Kingdom and the United States are as concerned about maintaining the opening of the Burma Road in the event of a Japanese attack as they are about maintaining the smooth flow of the Pacific route. At the same time, the Chinese authorities are taking all necessary precautions to cope with any eventuality. The speeches given by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Togo in the Diet today did not indicate any desire on the part of Japan to change its current policy. He saw no possibility of any compromise between the United States and Japan. Guo also spoke of the People's Political Council, saying that the democratic rights of other countries are often suppressed in wartime, while China is using this war to implement new democratic organizations such as the Political Council, which serve as a mechanism for the exchange of views between the government and the people's representatives. Moreover, because the Political Council includes representatives from various political parties, it is a sign of internal unity. Although China's democracy is not yet comparable to that of the United Kingdom and the United States, we are not satisfied with the status quo. China is moving forward on the path of modern democracy and adapting China's ancient traditions to the circumstances of this era. The mild tone of Prime Minister Tojo's speech has increased the belief here that Japan will try to avoid war with the United States. Some had believed that Tojo might adopt a threatening posture in order to strengthen Kurusu's position in Washington, but Tojo apparently did not do so. (17th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Golden Snub-Nosed Monkey Discovered in Western Sichuan</h3>
<p>Chongqing According to news here yesterday, on the day the panda left here for the United States, an even rarer animal, perhaps one of the rarest in the world, was taken to Chengdu. This animal is the golden snub-nosed monkey, also known as the blue-faced monkey. Guineisen, a representative of the North American Newspaper Alliance who released the news, said that the monkey is only three feet tall when standing upright and has very long arms. The monkey's back and shoulders are covered with long, shiny golden hair, and the hair on its chest is shorter and light yellow. Its face is dark blue. The monkey was captured in the wilderness 200 miles west of Chengdu. After the monkey was transported to Chengdu a few days ago, people there telegraphed Madame Chiang Kai-shek, so that the monkey could also be given to the United States, but Madame Chiang Kai-shek declined, as the panda had already left.

<p>Reuters Dispatch, Hong Kong, 17th An editorial in the "Hong Kong Telegraph" today said that the most reassuring aspect of Hong Kong's welcoming of Canadian troops with a sense of gratitude is that well-trained and well-equipped troops have been transferred to Hong Kong. This place has always been a shield of the British Empire, and now the defense of its coast and borders has been strengthened by the arrival of Canadian soldiers.

<h3>Key to War or Peace in the Pacific; US-Japan Talks Begin; Nomura and Kurusu Visit Secretary of State Hull; Unlikely to Achieve Anything Given Unchanged Basic Policies</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th Talks that well-informed sources say will determine the tense issue of war or peace in the Pacific began today between Secretary of State Hull and Japanese special envoy Kurusu. Kurusu may meet with President Roosevelt today, but the main part of the talks will be conducted by Hull. Japanese Ambassador to the United States Admiral Nomura will also participate in this State Department negotiation. The talks will begin at 10:30 AM today (11:30 PM Shanghai time). Ambassador Nomura and Kurusu discussed various preliminary details at the Japanese embassy yesterday. Reliable sources say that Ambassador Nomura will continue to be the main spokesman for the Japanese side, while Kurusu will be a "negotiator for extraordinary times." Japanese sources say that they believe there is hope of reaching an understanding. Experts on foreign policy in Congress also reflect the same view. However, diplomats from various countries almost unanimously say that Kurusu has little chance of success. Diplomats believe that the United States has the cooperation of China, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Dutch East Indies, and the Soviet Union, and its diplomatic position is very strong. Therefore, the United States is unlikely to make concessions. On the other hand, the Japanese government has adopted a tough, aggressive stance in the past three years, so it is difficult for the country to change its policies without causing serious domestic reactions. The problem between the United States and Japan is whether the United States can allow Japan to continue its policy of expansion and promote its "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." This "Co-Prosperity Sphere" would include economic or political enslavement of China. The United States has already begun to assist China, the United Kingdom, the Dutch East Indies, and other countries that are about to be defeated by Japan. The United States believes that it is about to become a very great defeated country, because the interests of the United States in areas entered by the Japanese army, such as Manchuria, China, and French Indochina, have already been destroyed. The United States accuses Japan of being an aggressor, so it opposes Japan's program, especially now wishes to contain Japan, because Japan is allied with the Axis. The Japanese recognize that the situation is very serious, on the one hand because they cannot withstand economic sanctions, and on the other hand because Japanese newspapers are singing tunes urging the government to "break through the encirclement of democratic countries." Observers doubt whether Japan, regardless of the fact that the four-year-old, fruitless war of aggression against China is still ongoing, will risk fighting another country in the Pacific. However, many believe that the Japanese have a "suicide disease," so they may not hesitate to make a desperate gamble.</p>
<p>Close Military Cooperation Between Australia and New Zealand; Preparing to Resist Any Aggression</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Washington, 17th New Zealand Prime Minister Nash broadcast Australia and New Zealand's common defense policy and his feelings after his recent trip to Australia, saying that a major conflict could occur in the Pacific at any time. He is confident that Australia's military preparations will be a powerful and decisive element in resisting any challenge to freedom and democracy in the Pacific. Japan has joined the Axis and seems determined to pursue a policy of aggression. This is something that Australia and New Zealand must pay very serious attention to.</p>

<p>Reuters Dispatch, Melbourne, 17th Mr. Duff Cooper, the British War Cabinet's representative in the Far East, spoke to the public here yesterday, saying that we will not cease fighting until Hitler and his ideology and supporters are completely destroyed. The highest principle of the Nazi Party is that Germans are masters and others are their slaves. Hitler knows nothing of what is called kindness, humanity, gentleness, or generosity. His concentration camps and the treatment he inflicts on the Polish people will make the name of Nazism stink for ten thousand years. We are responsible for resisting this devil.</p>
<h3>Thailand Takes Precautions by Conscripting Volunteers; Thai Government Regains Command; Japanese Feel Uneasy About It</h3>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 17th A Bangkok radio station said last night that the Prime Minister threatened to resign because the press, radio stations, and the people could not agree, so the radio stations stopped broadcasting criticisms and issued warnings to the people, saying that they must be prepared to deal with possible disputes. Moments later, the government ordered the governors of each province to recruit volunteers aged 18 to 45 and 46 and over. Senior Thai government officials said that they did not expect Thailand to be drawn into the war, but also said that the future cannot be predicted. Japanese sources here said that the Japanese ambassador in Bangkok was "panic-stricken" about the government's re-establishment of supreme command.</p>
<h3>Speeches by Tojo and Togo Clarifying Three Points of Japanese National Policy: Indicating That the US Should Not Obstruct Japan's Establishment of a New Order in East Asia, the Tone is Still Moderate, but Implies Despair and Pessimism</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th - The speeches delivered by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in the Diet this morning, while lacking any sensational remarks, have at least corroborated the concepts regarding Japan's position held by well-informed circles in Tokyo in recent months. Both speeches were unusually moderate in tone, but implied an atmosphere of despair and pessimism. Foreign Minister Togo, while not explicitly stating this point, emphasized the peace of the Pacific Ocean, now pinned on Kurusu's mission to Washington. Prime Minister Tojo also explicitly stated that Japan requires Britain and the United States, along with their allies, to reverse their current policies towards Japan. However, the outcome remains uncertain.</p>
<p>Prime Minister's Speech</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 17th - Prime Minister Tojo delivered a 25-minute speech in the House of Peers this morning, stating that based on past experiences, it is difficult to predict the outcome of the Japan-US negotiations. Therefore, the government is determined to adopt all necessary plans to realize Japan's firm policies. Japan is continuing diplomatic negotiations with the US government, genuinely attempting to eliminate the interference of third countries in the China Incident, end hostile actions such as the economic blockade imposed on Japan by foreign countries, restore normal international economic relations, and strive to prevent the European war from spreading to the Far East. If these three objectives are achieved through diplomatic efforts, not only will Japan be pleased, but it will also create peace in East Asia and the world. However, based on past experiences, the outcome of the negotiations remains uncertain. The government, foreseeing the obstacles in its path, is determined to spare no effort in safeguarding the survival of the Japanese Empire through various preparations, in order to actively implement its established national policies. Continuing his review of the</p>
<p>Northern Situation, he stated that since the start of the German-Soviet war in June, the possibility of its future changes is a cause for concern. Japan cannot remain indifferent to this development. In view of this, the government is now taking all necessary plans to ensure peace in the north. Regarding the situation in the south, the Prime Minister mentioned the peaceful entry of Japanese troops into northern Vietnam. Japan and Vietnam have concluded an economic agreement, Thailand and Vietnam have mediated border disputes, and Japan and Vietnam have established close and harmonious relations. Japan has begun peaceful advances in the south, but the military and economic cooperation between Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India has been enhanced. Japan's economic negotiations with the Netherlands East Indies have failed. The overall situation contains a serious threat to Japan's position in the South Pacific. Therefore, Japan has concluded a joint defense</p>
<p>Agreement with the Vichy Government. According to the agreement, Japan was able to send reinforcements to southern Vietnam in late July. However, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and India deeply distrusted this legitimate self-defense plan, and froze the assets of Japanese people in their respective countries, ultimately implementing an economic blockade through a complete embargo. At the same time, they rapidly expanded their anti-Japanese military plans. It is difficult to understand how an economic blockade can be implemented between non-belligerent countries, and its hostile nature is no less than an armed operation plan. This kind of action not only hinders the resolution of the China Incident that Japan desires to achieve, but also greatly affects the survival of the Japanese Empire. Therefore, Japan cannot tolerate it. Although Japan has always earnestly desired the preservation of peace, it has spared no effort in using diplomatic negotiations to eliminate this crisis, so that the overall situation can be resolved peacefully. However, Japan's expectations have not been realized. The Empire has had to deal with a serious situation and must decide on the course to be taken for generations to come. Tojo then discussed the</p>
<p>War in China, stating that the work of resolving the war has entered its final stage, but the economic and military activities of the countries assisting General Chiang Kai-shek have become increasingly active. This is the last remaining pillar of Chongqing's ability to resist, and it is greatly hindering the successful conclusion of the China Incident. Tojo finally expressed his deep gratitude to Manchukuo and the Nanjing government for their continued cooperation with Japan, and congratulated the achievements of the allied nations, especially Germany and Italy, stating that Japan hopes that these countries will achieve victory and lay the foundation for a new world order based on justice with the Japanese Empire.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister's Speech</p>
<p>He stated that although Japan is striving towards reconciliation and completing Japan-US negotiations, our moderate attitude naturally has a limit. If a situation arises that threatens the survival of the Empire or harms Japan's prestige as a major power, Japan must deal with it with a firm attitude. This is beyond doubt. Japan-US negotiations have lasted for six months, so there is no need to waste more time in the future. If the US government sincerely wants to preserve world peace, like Japan, understands Japan's natural needs and its position in East Asia, and considers the current situation in which Japan finds itself based on reality, then a friendly outcome is not impossible. Talks are still in progress, but he cannot disclose the details of the talks. In addition to seeking a successful conclusion to the war in China, Japan is also concerned about the situation in the north and the south seas. The Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact was concluded for this reason, in order to ensure peace in the north. Although war has broken out between Germany and the Soviet Union, Japan is still striving to maintain its policy of preserving peace in the north. Japan is determined to use various methods to prevent the occurrence of factors that may disturb peace in the north, and not only that, but also to prevent the development of situations that may threaten Japan's interests. The Foreign Minister then spoke of Japan's friendly relations with Vietnam and Thailand, stating that the malicious propaganda of third countries, saying that Japan is plotting aggressive attempts in that area, is truly regrettable. When Japanese troops entered southern Vietnam in accordance with the joint defense agreement, Britain and the United States viewed this as a threat to their territories, and froze the assets of Japanese people in their countries. This act is equivalent to a plan to sever economic relations. Britain and the United States also induced Australia, the Netherlands East Indies to join the encirclement of Japan, so the current situation facing Japan is becoming increasingly tense. Anti-Japanese pressure has become a real and serious problem. Japan is now facing an unprecedented difficult situation, so the entire nation must unite and join the military to cope with the most critical era in Japanese history.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Kaya Reports: Financial Situation; Four Years of War Expenditure in China Reaches 4.8 Billion Yuan</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 17th - Finance Minister Kaya reported to the Diet today that although the Sino-Japanese War has continued for four and a half years, Japan's finances are still very sound. Japan still has a large amount of financial resources to cope with national expenditures. He said that the nation's economic power has also been greatly enhanced in all aspects. Kaya also said that the freezing restrictions by Britain and the United States have seriously affected Japan's economy, so it is necessary to quickly establish the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and expand national defense institutions to resist any unreasonable forces that disrupt the order in East Asia. The Finance Minister requested 3,800,000,000 yen for special military expenses to cope with the increased emergency expenses of the army and navy, so as to end the China Incident and adapt to the current tense situation. The Finance Minister also stated that taxes have been expanded to meet the government's huge expenditures. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, government expenditures have reached 4,800,000,000 yuan, approximately equivalent to the total expenditure of Japan in the seventy years before 1936. Kaya also said that economic cooperation between Japan, Manchuria, and China has made significant progress, and trade with East Asian countries other than China and Manchuria has also greatly increased. Japan's new capital and savings have also increased, sufficient to absorb 20,000,000,000 yen of bonds and invest 23,000,000,000 yen in production and expansion.</p>
<h3>Japan's Collapsing Ambitions: Ambitiously Plans to Dig a Canal in the Kra Isthmus; If This Happens, the Strategic Situation Will Be Completely Changed</h3>
<p>Havas, Tokyo, 17th - The English-language "Japan Chronicle" of Kobe published today that Japan has long had the intention of digging a canal in the Kra Isthmus of the Malay Peninsula. "This plan is most likely to be realized at present. According to this plan, it was drafted by French engineer Lesseps. If it can be realized, the military situation in the North Pacific waterway will be completely changed. Japanese ships can sail to the Indian Ocean more safely," it said.</p>
<h3>US Navy Department Announces: Intercepted Axis Ship; Attempted to Sink Itself While Carrying Supplies Under the American Flag, But Failed</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 17th - The Navy Department announced yesterday that an Axis merchant ship flying the American flag was captured by a US cruiser west of the equatorial zone in the Atlantic. This is the first ship captured since the US fleet began patrolling the Atlantic at the start of the European war. Although this simple announcement did not elaborate on the matter, observers here believe that the captured ship was carrying supplies obtained from South America. The Navy Department did not state the nationality of the merchant ship, only that it belonged to the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 17th - On November 6, a US cruiser captured an Axis ship flying the American flag. The disposal of the crew has not yet been disclosed, but it is likely that they have all been taken to port. It is generally believed that once the ship is under US jurisdiction, it will be confiscated, just like some other Axis ships in US ports earlier this year. According to a statement issued by the Navy, a US cruiser saw a merchant ship flying the American flag at dawn on November 6, and the American flag was painted on both sides of the hull and on the deck. Upon approaching, the name of a certain US ship was seen on both sides of the bridge and on both sides of the ship. However, due to its suspicious behavior, the cruiser immediately sent a "stop" signal and lowered a small boat to send an officer to investigate. But before the boat reached the ship, the crew began to abandon ship and flee, while hoisting a signal saying, "This ship is sinking, please send a boat to transport passengers." Immediately afterward, two explosions were heard inside the ship. The US cruiser immediately sent a rescue team to board the ship. After several hours of work, they managed to repair the leaks caused by the explosions and restarted its engine. According to the US cruiser's report, judging from the ship's documents, it is known that it is owned by people from a certain Axis country. The hull has been deliberately damaged by its crew and is severely damaged and cannot navigate. The US cruiser's crew is now trying to sail the ship to a seaport under the jurisdiction of the US court for repairs.</p>
<h3>General Weygand Returns Home for Duty; No Replacement Yet for the Army Minister, Darlan Temporarily Assumes Ministerial Duties</h3>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 17th - French Commissioner for Africa General Weygand, after meeting with Marshal Pétain yesterday, met with Cabinet Secretary Darlan again today. It is said that Weygand's mission is to discuss economic issues in North Africa, and he will soon return to Algiers.</p>
<p>Reuters, French Border, 17th - Weygand's arrival in Vichy is to report to Pétain on the recent discussions with the late Huntziger and to consider Huntziger's replacement. According to people close to Vichy, Germany favors Weygand as Army Minister and Dentz as Governor-General of North Africa to succeed Dentz. However, it is generally believed that Weygand may not be willing to give up his position in North Africa.</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 17th - After the death of Army Minister General Huntziger, his ministerial duties will be temporarily assumed by Cabinet Secretary Darlan, and military affairs will be presided over by Chief of Staff General Picquendar. As for the choice of a new Army Minister, it is difficult to decide for the time being.</p>
<h3>British Lord Privy Seal Attlee Arrives in Lisbon by Plane from the US</h3>

<h3>Britain to Open Second Front in the Middle East; Eighth Army Formed in the Western Desert; There Are Now Five Main Routes to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 17th - It was officially announced today that a new army has been formed, named the Eighth Army of the Western Desert. Cairo welcomes this news and sees it as a sign of the increased strength of British and Allied forces in the Middle East. It is believed that the army will have modern equipment, as the large amount of modern equipment that has been shipped to the Middle East in recent months is an open secret.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 17th - "Paris Soir" French reporter Bido said that Britain has five main routes that can be used to transport supplies directly from Iraq or India to the Transcaucasus and the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The first route is located in the far west, starting from Qurna in Iraq, passing through Kermanshah and reaching the Soviet Caucasus border of Dzhulfa, where there is a railway connecting to Tbilisi. The second route is a road from Khanaqin in Iraq, passing through Qomash and Amol and reaching the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. The third route is the Syrian railway. The fourth route is the ancient post road, starting from Bushehr on the Persian Gulf and ending in Tehran. This road is now suitable for cars. The fifth route is considered important, starting from Karachi in India, passing through Balochistan and reaching Duzdab in Iran, then running along the Afghan border, stopping north of Mashhad, and one stop further is the railway connecting to the Transcaucasus and the Caspian Sea, he said.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Campaign to Eradicate Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>In the interest of the city's health and happiness, the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association is advocating the eradication of tuberculosis. Within this week, it will hold an expanded publicity and fundraising campaign, planning to raise one million yuan to build a large-scale tuberculosis hospital. This measure is of great importance to the welfare of the entire society and the health of mankind. We earnestly hope that it will be successful as soon as possible, and at the same time, we appeal to all sectors to provide widespread sympathy and assistance.</p>
<p>According to statistics from the health authorities of the two concessions, in 1940 alone, more than 3,700 people died of tuberculosis. It is estimated that the number of deaths this year will exceed 6,000. As for those who have not been treated or reported, and those who suffer from the same disease and death in Chinese areas outside the concessions, they are even more countless. According to Dr. Henry Lester's rough estimate, at least 54,000 Shanghai citizens currently suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis should be hospitalized, and at least 8% have tuberculosis without realizing it—in other words, 320,000 people out of Shanghai's population of four million are being attacked by tuberculosis every day.</p>
<p>Such an alarming number does not allow us to hesitate any longer, we must exert all our intelligence to quickly eradicate this invisible enemy. People often have the bad habit of hiding their illnesses and avoiding doctors. They do not pay attention to their personal health, and even consider treating diseases to be unpleasant. As for undergoing physical examinations every year to prevent the invasion of diseases, that is even rarer. Once the disease has entangled them, they panic and seek medical attention. The delay in time affects the physiological changes, and often small illnesses become big illnesses, and big illnesses are misdiagnosed. As a result, precious lives are easily lost. This is extremely common and extremely tragic. In addition to those who hide their illnesses and avoid doctors, there are also many poor people who, because they cannot afford medical treatment, do not know what disease they are suffering from. The so-called charitable hospitals that provide free medical care often use the superficial symptoms presented by patients as the basis for diagnosis, treating them lightly and giving them the wrong medicine. In fact, the seriousness of the patient's condition may not be completely clear to the examiner. As a result, they are delayed and cannot be cured. Every year, countless millions of people lose their lives in this way. Therefore, while we vigorously support the eradication of tuberculosis, we also suggest that we use twelve points of strength to engage in tuberculosis prevention, such as the implementation of early examinations and the equipment for isolation and recuperation, all of which should be carried out as soon as possible, so that we can prevent problems before they occur and eliminate them invisibly. The most urgent work is to carry out widespread publicity, so that the dangerous impression of tuberculosis enters the hearts of everyone.</p>
<p>As for the significance of the campaign to eradicate tuberculosis, it is profound and significant to the country and society. From a passive perspective, this measure is to restore individual health, and from an active perspective, it is to strengthen national power. People suffering from lung disease extend their lives through appropriate treatment. They will certainly be able to accomplish more in their careers and make more contributions to the country. Assuming that one person can gain an extra year of work, then 10,000 people can have 10,000 years of achievement. What is its impact on national power? Therefore, the campaign to eradicate and prevent tuberculosis can certainly be called a campaign to strengthen national power!</p>
<p>We should also deeply recognize that anything involving the social public must have a close relationship with anyone's interests. The tuberculosis prevention campaign is one such example. Eradicating the great enemy of society is to protect one's own family. We must give it our full support. The gentlemen of the Anti-Tuberculosis Association have shouldered the great and righteous cause of benefiting the masses. Their organization is very sound and open. In order to ensure that all donations can be used for public purposes, all publicity and necessary expenses for fundraising are undertaken by the staff themselves. Such pure good intentions will surely arouse the infinite sympathy of the latent society and establish a good model for running charitable undertakings. We look forward to the near future when the great tuberculosis hospital will meet the society with brand-new scientific equipment; and the eradication of tuberculosis throughout Shanghai has been planted here with its foundation.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Production and National Economy</h3>
<p>The world often believes that the foundation of the national economy is based on industry. Therefore, whether economic problems can be properly resolved depends on the progress of industrial development. According to this logic, if industry can achieve rational development, then the establishment of the foundation of the national economy can be solved easily. The importance of this industry is undeniable. However, without the nourishment of agriculture and the life-sustaining elements that can fill the stomach and maintain vitality, even the national defense industry of airplanes and cannons and the novel products that satisfy the material enjoyment of life will be useless. Therefore, the importance of agriculture is no less than that of industry.</p>
<p>Although countries with developed national defense industries and manufacturing industries can exchange their inherent products for agricultural products from other countries, from the perspective of national and ethnic standpoints, all countries are actively seeking to complete their entire economic mechanism and seek independent survival. There are many examples of great powers supporting agricultural production as an economic foundation. The United States is the world's largest industrial country, but its economic foundation is still built on agricultural production, so the rise and fall of its social economy depends entirely on the prosperity and decline of agriculture. The United Kingdom has always been the leader in the world's industry, but it still relies on the supplement of agriculture. Therefore, it has expanded its territory, with agriculture as the center to support and complete its economic supply network. In recent years, the rapid progress of industry in Soviet Russia has been watched by the world, and its progress in agricultural production has also repeatedly set world records, and it has been established as the foundation of the Soviet Russian economy. Germany has a small area and focuses on industry, but the lack of agricultural production constitutes a serious gap in the German economy. Therefore, it uses various methods in peacetime to obtain assistance from the agricultural products of various countries, and this time, it is willing to be the first to start the Second World War, also because it urgently needs to seek a way out for the livelihood of its people.</p>
<p>Since the importance of agricultural production is as mentioned above, it is not difficult for us to imagine how governments of various countries attach importance to the distribution and consumption of agricultural production. The selling price of agricultural products in peacetime does not fluctuate wildly, and the right of equal enjoyment by the people is guaranteed. In wartime, the government imposes strict control. The government distributes personal or family consumption according to the specified price, so there is absolutely no malady of favoritism. But these are all minimum facilities. Countries such as Soviet Russia and Germany regard agricultural products as a second life, and compare them to airplanes and cannons. Now, let us briefly list two of Germany's agricultural policies to clarify the truth.</p>
<p>Since the Nazis took power, Germany's food policy has imitated the Soviet Union's use as a political weapon. All those who want to awaken national unity, urge farmers to cooperate, supervise the rational construction of manufacturing, change the habits of people who are addicted to luxurious living, and promote general internal affairs problems, all use the supply or non-supply of this food weapon as a guide. Those who commit crimes and repeatedly fail to repent will be punished by stopping the supply of food, and those who have achievements or merits will increase their food supply as a reward.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, the Nazi food policy revolution fully demonstrates its understanding of the importance of agricultural production. Since 1934, the Nazis have imitated Mussolini's policy and started their production war, first reducing imports, then increasing food prices, and reducing the profits of distributors. Therefore, the burden of consumers has slightly increased, and the profits of businessmen have greatly decreased. Therefore, the profits of domestic agricultural development belong to the government. All agriculture and agriculture-related manufacturing industries have been carefully studied and thoroughly transformed; whether farmers, laborers, food distributors, or milk retailers, they are all compiled as Nazi food soldiers and promote this new food policy for the government. After the completion of this food policy revolution, the experiment of reforming eating habits and cooking methods was promoted. After the joint research of first-class economists, food nutritionists, and psychologists, the amount of food consumption for each person was formulated, and this formulated food unit was handed over to the people for testing. Since the Nazis declared war on Poland on September 1, 1939, the German people have uniformly implemented this food unit consumption, and have never slackened until now. This is the Nazi's method of solving food shortages, and their intentions are also very good.</p>
<p>Our country claims to be founded on agriculture, but it is a great regret that the people's food cannot be self-sufficient. In order to punish the past and be wary of the future and to consider the general trend of the world, our country is most suitable for running agriculture, because agriculture is easier to succeed; industry can be carried out in parallel, but we should not hold excessive hope, because from the standpoint of the national economy, we should urgently revitalize agriculture to consolidate the foundation and then make other plans.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that the Farmers Bank will buy the land of large landlords and sublet it to tenant farmers for cultivation. This is the prelude to the implementation of President Sun Yat-sen's legacy of equal land rights. All nationals support it. But what we dare to say at this time is that after the land is subleased to tenant farmers for cultivation, the government must still bear the responsibility of guidance and support, and must perform the result of the highest efficiency production and consolidate the foundation of the national economy. In other words, if the government implements this new land rights policy, then the government should take responsibility and complete its mission.</p>

<h3>The Female Calamity of the French Political World</h3>
<p>What Hélène most desired was to intertwine her destiny with that of her lover. At this time, Reynaud and his wife, Hélène and Count de Portes, were already separated. Reynaud’s wife had volunteered as a paratrooper nurse, and Count de Portes had been called up for military service.</p>
<p>Reynaud and Hélène lived together at the Palais Bourbon, directly opposite the National Assembly. However, Reynaud's wife was unwilling to divorce, and according to French law, under such circumstances, remarriage was not permitted unless it could be proven that the couple had been separated for more than three years. Hélène wanted to amend this law, but unfortunately, the only person with the power to change the law was the Minister of Justice, who at that time was Reynaud himself. He could not automatically amend it without disregarding his integrity.</p>
<p>Hélène did not hesitate at all and immediately went to see her formidable rival, the Marchioness de Crussol, and said to her: "If you want Reynaud to give up his ambition to become Prime Minister, if you want Daladier to give him a position so that he can better serve France, then we should let him be Minister of Finance. The current Minister of Finance, Marchandeau, is mediocre and incompetent, and also a supporter of the Munich policy. Bonnet is no longer Minister of Foreign Affairs, Daladier can take over the responsibility, and let Bonnet be Minister of Justice. Such a cabinet will certainly last longer."</p>
<p>The Marchioness de Crussol took Hélène to see Daladier, and this new arrangement was understood and established.</p>
<p>After Bonnet was appointed Minister of Justice, Hélène immediately went to see her friend Madame Bonnet and said: "Reynaud and your husband should reconcile. Tomorrow Reynaud will be Prime Minister, and he will recall Bonnet to take charge of the judicial office. But now I want Bonnet to do something for me, he should amend the divorce law."</p>
<p>After Bonnet took office as Minister of Justice, his first new initiative was to reduce the waiting period for remarriage after divorce from three years to one year.</p>
<p>Daladier was having a headache. Paul Reynaud's every move seemed as if he was about to become Prime Minister. He saw many political enemies targeting the current cabinet. Those who cooperated with him criticized the government leader's improper measures. Reynaud, through Hélène's house, entertained important military figures. Even General Têtu, the Secretary-General of Daladier's military advisory council, and General Giraud, to whom the advocates of offensive strategy pinned their hopes, were among those invited.</p>
<p>The Marchioness called the Countess, asking her to explain the truth. Hélène immediately went to see Daladier. Her excuse was very unique. She said: "If Paul's actions are indeed in breach of the agreement, it is only because his circumstances are so bad that he has no choice. You should force him to remove his Secretary-General, Palewski."</p>
<p>Thus, Hélène seized the opportunity to remove the thorn in her side. He was her most formidable enemy, and had been cooperating with Reynaud for ten years. He had always opposed that beautiful Countess.</p>
<p>Hélène immediately gave this position to her two confidants—Léguère and Trefeu.</p>
<p>Hélène had arranged everything. Reynaud must become Prime Minister. After the Finnish war, he indeed got his wish. The post of Minister of War was still held by Daladier concurrently.</p>
<p>Hélène no longer hid behind the scenes. Now she freely received guests at the Palais Bourbon and the Prime Minister's residence. She was now acting on her own.</p>
<p>At one cabinet meeting, Daladier passively resisted Reynaud's political views. He and Gamelin expressed their agreement and refused to send troops to Norway. He had had a broken foot for a long time, and he used this as an excuse not to go to London to sign the treaty that Britain and France should not make peace separately, which was signed on April 4th.</p>
<p>By May 10th, the German army suddenly advanced and broke through the defense line, causing great panic among the French General Staff and the government authorities. We should forgive Hélène and admit that she did not take time off to enjoy herself. She got up for twenty hours every day, running around, taking care of Reynaud's health, opposing the ministers leaving Paris, and advocating replacing Gamelin and Daladier with Weygand.</p>
<p>Reynaud himself quite hoped that his old friend General de Gaulle would be appointed Chairman of the Military Committee. Since 1936, de Gaulle had from time to time provided Reynaud with military documents, and later they all came true one by one. But Hélène insisted that he would be more beneficial to the country on the front lines. He had commanded the French tank corps and had long been well-known.</p>
<p>Instead, Hélène gave this position to Colonel Villelume, a famous officer in her reception room and a famous figure of defeatism.</p>
<p>The German army continued to advance. The Prime Minister's entire time was spent in Hélène's conspiracy. Her ingenious plans became more and more bizarre. She replaced the hardline Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Léger, and appointed her best friend, Baudouin, who was known for his Anglophobia, as Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Secondly, she had her children escorted to the United States by a nanny.</p>
<p>At this time, the German army was advancing rapidly on all fronts, and the French army collapsed at the sight of them. The government evacuated Tours. Hélène and the Prime Minister were inseparable. Anyone who wanted to see him had to see her first.</p>
<p>The tragic end arrived. Those who favored an armistice and those who advocated continuing the war engaged in a fierce debate.</p>
<p>Reynaud firmly advocated continuing the war.</p>
<p>The German army was getting closer and closer. Tours had been bombed, and the government had to move to Bordeaux. Hélène abandoned all flattery and malice. She did not dress up and often wore a blue-purple dress, running around. She urged Reynaud to give way to Pétain and Baudouin.</p>
<p>She allowed Reynaud to have a seat as Ambassador to the United States. His name had been submitted to Washington. At ten o'clock in the evening on July 16th, Reynaud finally agreed. Originally, Hélène said to him: "Once we get to New York, we can get married."</p>
<p>Her great adventure did not succeed, but she did not give up everything.</p>
<p>On July 22nd, the day the armistice agreement was established, Léguère and Trefeu were suddenly arrested in Spain. They were Reynaud's comrades and Hélène's good friends. She had encouraged Baudouin to send one as a financial counselor to the United States and the other as the director of the French Purchasing Commission in New York to preside over liquidation matters.</p>
<p>Léguère and Trefeu were on a diplomatic mission, but the Spanish guards pretended not to know and searched their luggage as usual. As a result, in addition to important diplomatic documents, they also found jewelry, bonds, and gold worth two million francs. The French consul in San Sebastian immediately received the following notice: According to Léguère and Trefeu's explanation, this is the private property of the Countess de Portes, and as for the two million francs in gold, it is the government's secret fund, prepared for official expenses in the United States.</p>
<p>The gold was transported back to France by sea by the French ambassador in Madrid. The diplomatic documents were returned two weeks later.</p>
<p>Reynaud's appointment had been accepted by the White House, but it was immediately cancelled.</p>
<p>At that time, Reynaud and Hélène were on their way to southern France. On the way, they received the news of Léguère and Trefeu's arrest. (The two were later allowed to go to Portugal and then to Britain)</p>
<p>On June 27th, after Reynaud visited his daughter in Saint-Maxime, he and Hélène met in a restaurant. They both felt depressed. Hélène drove the car herself. An hour later, the car crashed into a telephone pole. When she was discovered, Hélène was dead, and Reynaud was also seriously injured.</p>
<p>Was this an accidental accident, an assassination, or a deliberate suicide? We will probably never know.</p>
<p>That woman, known as the "National Mother of the Ruined Country" in France, ended her life's adventure in this way.</p>
<p>As for the other heroines, they also temporarily disappeared. We only know that Bredin is still loyal to Mandel and lives in Riom, and goes to the prison to visit the former minister whenever she has the opportunity. There she can also meet Gamelin.</p>
<p>As for the Marchioness de Crussol, she never visited Daladier once. Reynaud, with his head bandaged, was confined alone in an ancient castle, immersed in memories of passionate love and the scars of failure every day.</p>
<h3>Snowstorm on the Moscow Front, Soviet Counterattacks Continue to Win, More Than Twenty Villages Recovered in the Central Route, German Troops Unable to Endure the Severe Cold and Feel Great Pain</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 17th - Moscow Radio this morning reported that the German advance on the front lines in that area was being blocked everywhere. The Soviet army is now engaged in counterattacks. The German offensive towards Kalinin has been curbed. Two German infantry regiments, assisted by ninety tanks, had occupied three strongholds in the Volokolamsk area, but two of them were recaptured by the Soviet army that night. In the Maloyaroslavets area, the Soviet artillery severely damaged the German army.</p>
<p>Associated Press, London, 17th - According to Moscow Radio yesterday, the Soviet army, in a blizzard, launched an attack from Moscow as the starting point, recovering twenty villages. In one area, they drove the German army back several kilometers. It was also said that the Soviet army had broken through the German army for the first time since the beginning of winter. Nazi tanks were frozen and unable to use their skills. It was also said that the severe Soviet winter had brought the eastern war to a standstill. Even in the Crimean region, it was reported that it had snowed. On the Kalinin and Tula front lines, the Soviet army claimed to be in a proactive position. The radio said that the German troops were still wearing summer uniforms, so they all wished "to die rather than endure this pain, and some were said to have almost starved to death." The Soviet army admitted that the situation in Kerch and Sevastopol was critical.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Reuters military commentator said that the twenty-second week of the Eastern Front war ended yesterday. Apart from the small victories in various places, there were no major developments on the long front line. The German side claimed to have occupied part of the Sevastopol defense line firmly held by the Soviet army, and captured more than a hundred strong strongholds near Tikhvin, southeast of Leningrad. However, more important than this is that the German side initially admitted that the Soviet army in the Moscow area was counterattacking with the assistance of artillery and tanks. The German communique had previously boasted that the Soviet army had been annihilated, and that the German army had been unable to take advantage of the victory to attack Moscow directly only because of the bad weather and muddy roads. Therefore, this admission of the Soviet counterattack exposed the hypocrisy of its previous statements. Today's Soviet communique spoke of fierce battles on the front lines, but the Moscow news reported that the Soviet army had taken fierce offensive actions from Kalinin to Tula, driving the German army out of several villages. Although there is currently no sign of a large-scale new offensive, the Soviet defenders have indeed gradually taken the initiative and are not allowing the German army to rest. The Soviet army is now engaging in harassing the German army's forward positions and preventing or slowing down the accumulation of its military supplies. There is often a period of time after winter when traffic is not greatly affected and the weather is not severe, but after this period, blizzards will begin and the temperature will drop sharply to forty or fifty degrees below freezing. The temperature in December always drops to this level. The second phase of winter this year came earlier, and it is now very cold. London received news that there were strong winds and heavy snow on the front lines. This kind of weather is not conducive to the German army's attack on Kerch and Sevastopol, but there are places on the Crimean Peninsula where large armies can spend the winter, because the climate in Yalta and Feodosia is quite warm.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - Soviet spokesman Losovsky claimed that the German troops attacking Moscow are currently building fortresses to prepare for winter warfare. According to a telegram from the Soviet News Agency, the Soviet army retreated from one village on the Kalinin front south of Moscow, but recovered four other villages. The Soviet army around Leningrad continued to counterattack the German army, driving the enemy out of their positions and inflicting heavy damage on them. The latest Soviet communique stated that there were battles on the entire front yesterday. The Soviet army in a certain area of the Kalinin front and the Southwestern front repelled a fierce attack by the German army, and the enemy suffered heavy losses in manpower and equipment.</p>
<p>German Troops Deepen into Crimea, Claim to Have Occupied the City of Kerch</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 16th - A radio station here has just broadcast a message claiming that German infantry has stormed into the city of Kerch at the easternmost tip of Crimea, and street fighting is now taking place in the city. As for the central route, the fierce fighting has lasted for five days, and both sides have suffered heavy casualties. On the northern route, progress has been hindered by the bad weather. The Red Army in the Leningrad area has launched a large-scale counterattack.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 17th, German Headquarters - This afternoon's German war report claimed that the German-Romanian Allied forces in Crimea occupied the city of Kerch after a fierce battle yesterday. The eastern part of Crimea is now entirely under German control. In total, this battle captured 101,600 enemy troops.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 17th, Berlin - Kerch, occupied by the German army yesterday, is the third largest city in Crimea, with a population of 105,000. It is located in the eastern part of Crimea, at the narrow entrance from the Black Sea to the Sea of Azov. The Kerch fort guards the strait. The city is the terminus of the railway, connecting the railway line from Moscow and Sevastopol to Dzhankoi. Kerch is about 100 kilometers from Feodosia, located on the Crimean southeastern coast, which was previously occupied by the German army. British military commentator Kinnate explained the military importance of Kerch on British radio. He said that the loss of the city was very serious, making it possible for the German army to invade the Caucasus. The city is about 300 kilometers from Maikop, the oil-producing center of the northern Caucasus.</p>
<p>Italian Troops Fighting in Ukraine, in a Difficult Situation and Urgently Awaiting Assistance</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 16th - The semi-official agency "German News Agency" has just issued a message claiming that Italian troops are fighting fiercely in the eastern part of Ukraine, and some units have penetrated deep into the Red Army's positions. However, they have encountered fierce attacks from the Red Army and are in a difficult situation and urgently awaiting assistance.</p>
<p>Havas, Moscow, 16th - The General Headquarters issued a war report at midnight stating that the Red Army repelled the enemy several times today in the Kalinin area on the northern route and in a certain area on the southern route. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and abandoned countless military equipment. In the past two days, the Red Army shot down more than sixty German aircraft.</p>

<h3>The Issue of US Military Defense Zone Handover is Being Discussed and Negotiated, to Be Decided by the Defense Force Commander's Meeting. The Date of Departure of the Fourth Regiment from Shanghai Has Not Been Disclosed. The US Consulate in Shanghai Reiterated the Withdrawal Advice Yesterday Morning.</h3>
<p>In order to implement the State Department's order, the US Consul General in Shanghai specifically announced yesterday morning that "the previously issued advice regarding the withdrawal of US citizens has not changed." The consulate also stated that later this month, the US President's Mailboat Company will have two ships sailing directly from Shanghai to Manila, with more than 200 first-class cabins. US citizens who intend to withdraw should quickly go to the US Mailboat Company to book cabins. The names of the above two ships were not mentioned in the announcement. Whether the US defense forces will withdraw on the same ships was also not disclosed.</p>
<p>Handover to the Merchant Corps is Most Reasonable</p>
<p>Colonel Howard, commander of the US Navy Fourth Regiment stationed in Shanghai, issued a formal departure order to officers of all ranks of the regiment yesterday. It is expected that the army will withdraw in the coming days. When reporters inquired with the responsible parties whether the defense zone left by the US military after leaving Shanghai would be taken over by the foreign merchant corps, the answer was that this matter would depend on the results of future meetings of the defense force commanders of various countries. According to news from sources close to the concession authorities, it is likely that the International Merchant Corps will take over the defense, but a full decision has not yet been made. At a minimum, the Bureau of Public Safety will be responsible for maintaining order. The Bureau of Public Safety is currently studying whether there are any shortcomings in the International Merchant Corps' long-term deployment and how to remedy them. In any case, the peace and security within the concession will not be affected in any way. At the same time, it is heard that an agreement has been established between the Bureau of Public Safety and the British and American authorities here regarding the police authority of the US defense zone, citing the agreement established with the International Merchant Corps when the last batch of British troops withdrew in August last year, promising the Merchant Corps to patrol in the area. Regarding which party will patrol in the US military defense zone in the future, dispatching the International Merchant Corps to take over the defense is also a reasonable choice. This matter is currently being studied by the Bureau of Public Safety with the Japanese side and other authorities. Also, the rumor spread by the Japanese side that the US military in Oxford, Shanghai, will be transferred to Manila has not been confirmed by official sources here.</p>
<p>Two Ships Come to Shanghai with Reserved Cabins</p>
<p>The US Consulate General in Shanghai formally announced this morning that two ships of the US President's Company will sail from Shanghai to Manila at the end of this month, with 200 first-class berths available for US citizens to withdraw. Those who wish to withdraw should purchase tickets from the President's Steamship Company in this city. The names of the two President ships and their arrival dates in Shanghai were not disclosed, nor was the possibility of the two ships carrying US Marines withdrawing mentioned. However, according to non-official Americans, if the two ships only have 200 berths for civilians to take to withdraw, then there are still many cabins left. Therefore, it is believed that these empty cabins have been reserved to carry US Marines. The President's Company here anticipated that US citizens would flock to purchase tickets after the US Consulate announced this this morning, so it has made preparations to deal with it. It is heard that there has been no unusual withdrawal activity among US citizens recently.</p>
<p>British Merchants in Tianjin Discuss Withdrawal</p>
<p>Representatives of 24 British merchant firms in Tianjin attended a meeting held by the British Chamber of Commerce on Thursday to discuss withdrawal plans. The disposal of assets and the transfer of funds were all included in the discussions. The merchant firms attending the meeting included Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, HSBC, and Chartered Bank. The British and American funds frozen in Japanese banks in Tianjin total 6.85 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Glassford Remains in Shanghai</p>
<p>Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, is currently staying in Shanghai and has been discussing defense matters with Colonel Howard, commander of the US Navy Fourth Regiment, for many days. The fleet's flagship Luzon (575 tons) is moored at the British naval buoy in the Huangpu River, while the cruisers Wake (450 tons) and Guam (370 tons) are patrolling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Sixty Thousand Bags of Stockpiled Rice Released for Retail, Rice Shops Pay and Collect Certificates, People Mountain, People Sea, the Quality of Rice Sold Must Be Based on the Wishes of the Buyer</h3>
<p>The Bean, Rice, and Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association has been instructed to register the Western rice stockpiled by members of the industry. It includes No. 1 and 2 Saigon rice, Yangon small crushed rice, Siamese rice, Yuan rice, Mindon rice, Haiphong rice, and other varieties, totaling more than 600,000 bags. Starting yesterday, various rice shops in the public concession have been paying and releasing goods separately, selling at a fixed price of 130 yuan per picul at retail outlets. Yesterday, because many rice shop personnel were unfamiliar with the payment and certificate collection procedures, and at the same time, the payment location (Wanfeng Rice Shop, No. 1 Catholic Church Street) had limited space, there were crowds of people and it was quite crowded. After the glass window wall was slightly damaged, after temporary discussions, it was moved to the second floor of the Miscellaneous Grain Association at No. 15 Avenue Edward VII from 1 pm that afternoon as the location for rice shop members to pay and collect certificates for the sale of stockpiled Western rice. The Rice Shop Association also decided to continue discussing the settlement method for Western rice purchased before the 9th today, because this matter has not been resolved yet.</p>
<p>Sales Method</p>
<p>The association yesterday reinstated two regulations for members to sell stockpiled Western rice, including: All outstanding matters of each member rice shop that paid and released goods on the 17th should complete the procedures at Wanfeng Rice Shop, No. 1 Catholic Church Street today, without delay. Because Western rice of various varieties such as fire crushed, Mindon, and Haiphong are heavier than other Western rice, each bag is one picul and three dou and a half, so when paying for the rice, a national currency of 175 yuan per bag must be topped up. As for Siamese and Saigon small crushed rice, etc., it is still 160 yuan. The association has decided to handle registration on a daily basis. All rice shops that have sold out Western rice can go to register for purchase every day. Yesterday, sixty households registered, with 4,660 bags.</p>
<p>Cannot Refuse to Sell</p>
<p>All rice shops that have released the recognized Western rice from the warehouse must sell it at the marked price at the retail outlets. Regardless of the quality of the rice, the selling price is the same. It is understood that the Food Rice Management Committee is paying close attention to the sale of stockpiled Western rice by rice shops. The sale of this Western rice by rice shops must be based on the rice needed by the rice purchasers. They must not use excuses to sell the lower-quality Western rice first. If the rice purchaser needs No. 1 Saigon, it must be measured and given as No. 1 Saigon. If they need small crushed rice, they must be measured and given as small crushed rice. If the Western rice needed by the rice purchaser is indeed sold out, then this is not an exception. However, the rice shop must immediately register with the association and continue to release goods to meet the door sales. If a rice shop has rice but refuses to sell it according to the number, anyone can report it in writing to the Food Rice Management Committee, but they must provide concrete evidence and facts.</p>
<h3>Exchange Settlement of Goods Limited to Absolutely Necessary Items</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance provided foreign exchange for the import of essential goods, it recently established application methods for foreign exchange. State-owned and public-owned enterprises, and joint government-business industrial and commercial enterprises, purchasing and transporting goods that are not prohibited from import and are domestically necessary, may apply to the Foreign Exchange Management Committee. After approval, they can designate the Central Bank to settle foreign exchange. For the foreign exchange needed by general private factories, firms, and individuals, they may apply to the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. This application must be handled on behalf of the China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the fourteen friendly banks and various commercial banks that operate foreign exchange business. After approval, they will notify the designated bank to settle foreign exchange. However, the imported goods are limited to absolutely necessary items in the country. The Ministry has already issued an order to various agencies and businesses to comply.</p>
<h3>Materials Transported to Singapore Require a Declaration, Starting Friday</h3>

<h3>French Ambassador Cosme Will Come to Shanghai and Transfer to Chongqing</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China Cosme, after leaving Shanghai and going to the Peninsula, recently came to Shanghai to maintain close contact with the Chinese government, and transferred to Chongqing via Hong Kong to visit the central authorities. The ambassador's wife arrived in Shanghai with her children by ship the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Retailers Should Limit Sales of Price-Controlled Items and Be Subject to Police Inspection at Any Time: First Retail Price List Disclosed</h3>
<p>In order to curb the prices of daily necessities in the city, the authorities of the two concessions recently drafted the first retail price list, which was officially announced yesterday and will be implemented starting today. This announcement covers items sold by 25 import firms, divided into 16 categories. Hereafter, all retail stores must sell according to this price list. Any arbitrary price increases will be punished. As for other items, discussions are underway to set maximum prices. Once agreed, the two concession authorities will continue to announce and implement them. The French Consul-General, Mr. Magny, also issued a public notice yesterday, stating that after the implementation of these new price controls, the French Concession authorities will, in accordance with the French Consular Decree of February 19, 1940, send personnel to inspect retail stores at any time. Refusal to allow inspection will be subject to the most severe penalties.

<h3>Domestic Postal Rates to Increase in Shanghai: Implementation Not Far Off; Current Discrepancies in Postal Rates are Significant, Post Office is Communicating with All Parties Involved</h3>
<p>Domestic postal rates have already been implemented in the Southwest and Fujian-Zhejiang regions on the first of this month. Mail from Zhejiang Province delivered to Shanghai already has $0.15 postage affixed. Shanghai's delay in implementation has caused public doubt and has resulted in significant discrepancies in postal rates for mail exchange within the same country. This causes many obstacles to postal administration.</p>
<p>Discrepancies in Postal Rates: Although the Shanghai Postal Administration claims that it has not yet received a clear order from the General Post Office, general speculation suggests that the complexity of Shanghai's environment and the various parties involved are still being coordinated, resulting in the staggered implementation schedule. Some opportunistic merchants are already taking advantage of the fact that Shanghai has not yet implemented the price increase and are sending larger quantities of mail, which is causing a loss in postal revenue.</p>
<p>Summary of New Postal Rates:</p>
<p>In Zhejiang, Fujian, and Southwest regions, the new postal rates have already been implemented. The rates are as follows: Ordinary letter: $0.15; Registered mail: $0.63; Express mail: $0.30; Registered express mail: $0.55; Postcard: $0.08; Printed matter not exceeding 100 grams: $0.04; 100 to 250 grams: $0.08; 250 to 500 grams: $0.16; 500 grams to 1 kilogram: $0.24; 1 kilogram to 3 kilograms: $0.48.</p>
<p>Price Increase Within Ten Days:</p>
<p>According to the latest information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, the Shanghai Postal Administration is actively preparing for the price increase and will announce its commencement as soon as possible, not waiting until December 1. Because inland regions have already implemented the increase, the implementation date in Shanghai cannot be further delayed. Another source suggests that it is likely to be implemented this weekend or early next week.</p>
<h3>Over Eight Hundred Bags of European and American Mail Transported to Manila Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mail delivery between Shanghai and the United States has become very convenient since the route was changed via Manila. The Shanghai Postal Administration dispatched a batch of mail for the United States, Canada, and various European countries yesterday at 4:00 PM, totaling over eight hundred bags. All were loaded onto ships to Manila to connect with American mail ships for onward transport.</p>
<h3>Authorities to Prioritize Price Controls on Chinese Necessities Such as Tofu, Straw Paper, and Tea</h3>

The reported coal needs will be investigated by the Municipal Council. If any fraudulent reporting is found, disciplinary measures will be taken regarding the allocation of coal by the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Bakery Prices to be Investigated</p>

<h3>Willow Shade Printing Manager Embezzles Funds: Awaiting Verification of the Amount</h3>
<p>Oberto Oxthwaite, a national of Honduras, a small country in South America, was working as the manager of the Willow Shade Printing Works, affiliated with the American Melintang Advertising Company at 117 Hong Kong Road. Recently, his superiors discovered that he had committed fraud and embezzled a large sum of public funds, amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The case was reported to the Central Police Station, and Western Detective Gais arrested Oxthwaite. According to the investigation, Oxthwaite used his authority to collude with others and impersonate customers to purchase the printing works' paper inventory. Oxthwaite approved the sale at pre-war market prices, and then, after a few days, another person would come forward and resell the same paper back to the printing works at the current market price. The pre-war paper prices were several times lower than the current market prices. With this back and forth, Oxthwaite earned a considerable profit. In addition, Oxthwaite concealed the death of an employee of the printing works, continuing to list the employee and receive salary payments. Therefore, yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, requested that he be temporarily detained while the exact amount was verified before filing charges. Oxthwaite also hired lawyer Wang Yaotang for his defense. Presiding Judge Feng reviewed the report and ordered Oxthwaite to be remanded to custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Public Officials to Defraud People of Money: He Peisheng Arrested</h3>
<p>He Peisheng, a native of Zhenjiang, is twenty-eight years old and resides at No. 2, Taihe Lane, Baille Road, French Concession. He used to work as a donation collector in the French Municipal Council. Due to his addictions and insufficient income, he engaged in private profiteering. After being discovered by the French authorities, he was suspended. Unexpectedly, He had a whimsical idea and impersonated a French Municipal Council inspector. He visited various residents in the French Concession, claiming to be investigating attic permits, and extorted money from those who had not yet obtained permits by threatening them. He then used the money to buy opium. This went on for four years. He defrauded more than 300 households. The Criminal Investigation Section of the French Police found out about it and ordered detectives to arrest He a few days ago. They also found a complete set of opium smoking paraphernalia, including a pipe and lamp, and a leather bag at his residence. During interrogation, He confessed to fraud, stating that he earned at least $400 or $500 per month.

<h3>Naughty Children "Riding the Tram": Full of Dangers, Xiao Wenbing is a Warning Example, Parents Please Take Note</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, a 14-year-old boy named Xiao Wenbing was killed by a British-owned Route 10 bus at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Datong Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang of the First Special Court, accompanied by a forensic doctor, went to the autopsy room on Jiaozhou Road to examine the body. It was determined that the deceased was indeed killed by a Route 10 bus. The body was released to his family for funeral arrangements. However, according to Huaguang News Agency, the deceased, Xiao Wenbing's father, runs a "tiger stove" (hot water stall) at No. 232, Shanhaiguan Road (corner of Carter Road). The deceased was a student at a primary school. On a holiday a few days ago, the deceased and three neighborhood children were playing "riding the tram" on Xinzha Road. At the time, the deceased was hanging on to the back of a Route 3 tram. When the tram reached the vicinity of Xinzha Road and Datong Road, he suddenly jumped off. A Route 10 bus was approaching from behind. Due to the suddenness, it was impossible to avoid him, and he was run over. The act of "riding the tram" is full of dangers and has always been prohibited. However, general children, not knowing the dangers, dare to commit the act. The deceased is one such example. Therefore, it is hoped that parents with children will pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Dies Suddenly at Western Clothing Store: Autopsy Ordered for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Wu Fuzeng (18 years old, from Suzhou), an apprentice at Wang Xingchang Western Clothing Store at 807 Nanjing Road, suddenly died a few days ago. Wu Jinfu, the deceased's brother, reported to the Old Gate Police Station that his brother's death was due to injuries sustained from being beaten by Zhang Zhanglin, the Ningbo foreman of the tailor shop. Chinese Detective Tao Genrong and Detective Song Wenqing arrested Zhang, but Zhang denied the assault, stating that the deceased had a stomachache, so he was sent to Zhang's residence for treatment, but he died en route. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that it was necessary to determine the cause of the deceased's death through an autopsy by the court's prosecutor before the facts could be clarified. Therefore, he requested permission to remand the case for further investigation. Presiding Judge Feng reviewed the report and ordered the case to be remanded for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Paint Workers Demand Increased Wages: Highest Wages Cannot Sustain Life</h3>
<p>There are approximately four thousand paint workers in the city. Recently, due to rising prices and difficult living conditions, their wages are insufficient to maintain a minimum standard of living. In addition, wages in this industry are calculated on a per-job basis, and on average, each worker works for only about half a month each month, making it even more difficult to survive. Faced with this dire situation, the industry's labor union has submitted a request to the industry association, requesting that the employers improve their treatment and increase the originally stipulated daily wage of $5.20. It is believed that the employers are sympathetic to the plight of the workers and a resolution is expected soon.</p>

<h3>People's Tuberculosis Hospital Opens Free Clinic</h3>

<h3>Zhang Gunian's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Gunian's exhibition is currently open at the Ningbo Native Place Association. Mr. Zhang served as the home inspector for Mr. Feng Chaoran. From childhood, he learned painting from his uncle. He is naturally intelligent, sharp-witted, and insightful. He was already famous in the art world in his youth. All who see his paintings praise them endlessly. After the outbreak of the war, Mr. Zhang traveled to famous scenic spots in the Southwest, such as the unique landscapes of Guilin and the majestic mountains and rivers of Sichuan. Mr. Zhang verified each landscape with his own experience, realizing that what ancient masters had painted as fictional landscapes were actually real mountains and rivers. Mr. Zhang returned to Shanghai from his travels, and his painting skills greatly improved. It is truly said that ten years of studying books is not as good as traveling a thousand miles. However, Mr. Zhang is inherently lazy and unwilling to put brush to paper easily. He also dislikes the practice of self-promotion. Recently, due to the urging of friends, he has publicly exhibited his recent works on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association for art lovers to appreciate. Mr. Zhang's paintings are based on the Four Wangs but also draw reference from various masters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties. Therefore, his paintings are natural and elegant, and they do not use strangeness to amaze the world. This is truly the authentic school of painting. Although Mr. Zhang has only displayed a few dozen paintings this time, all the winter landscape imitations of ancient works are exquisite and wonderful. It is difficult to find such quality. Those who love Mr. Zhang's paintings should not miss this opportunity.</p>

<h3>Educational Situation in Anhui Province in the Past Three Years (Part 3)</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education paid 4,000 yuan under the ordinary education relief fund. 28th Year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939] - Restoration and Establishment: In the spring of the 28th year of the Republic, the Department of Education, in view of the excessive number of out-of-school youth in the province and the worrying consequences of prolonged lack of education, expanded the number of classes in the five provincial schools in southern Anhui and established five temporary middle schools in Jiangbei. Together with southern Anhui, there were ten provincial schools, 118 classes, and 6,000 students. At the same time, the Department of Education selected and ordered the private secondary schools in each joint county to prepare for restoration. Thirty-four schools opened one after another in compliance with the order, with a total of 140 classes and approximately 5,000 students. Subsequently, due to the unsuitable allocation of sites for the temporary provincial middle schools in Jiangbei and the excessive number of students in one school, which was inconvenient for teaching, the Department of Education adjusted and divided the classes during the summer vacation of that year, adding six schools for a total of eleven. Thirteen private middle schools in joint counties were also approved by the Ministry of Education for establishment and restoration after the summer vacation. In winter, the Department of Education convened principals and experts from all secondary schools in the province to Lihuang to hold the "Provincial Secondary Education" and "Production Education Conference," to discuss the improvement of wartime secondary education and production education in Anhui Province. Lasting for a week, more than 300 important cases were resolved. 29th Year [of the Republic, i.e. 1940] - Adjustment and Addition: In the spring of the 29th year, the Department of Education reorganized all secondary schools in the province and actively added more. As of the end of the year, there were 74 provincial, joint-county, and private secondary schools in Anhui Province, with a total of 23,512 students. The number of teachers was slightly reduced compared to before the war, while the number of students had actually exceeded 4,000.</p>

<h3>Even Category C Once Reached 70 Yuan; Public Bonds Are Enthusiastically Sought After; Foreign Stocks Do Not Fall As Much As Generally Expected</h3>
<p>The public bond gray market rose sharply yesterday. Category B broke through 70 yuan, and even reached 71 yuan. Category C also broke through the 70 yuan mark. The sentiment was excellent, and retail demand was particularly strong. Xie Xingyuan's appetite was also very strong, and the sharp drop in cotton yarn further boosted public bonds. The situation was quite good. However, rumors were uncertain after the close. The visit of Kurusu [Saburō] to the United States was feared to have no good results. There were also unfounded rumors in Shanghai. Because the rise had been very sharp, a slight fall was expected. Yesterday morning, Zhongda and Xie Xingyuan had strong buying interest. Dahua, Yichang, and Tongkang also bought in. General retail investors were particularly enthusiastic. Runde, Tongshun, Senji, Datong, and Yitai were all selling. Category C opened at 68.1 yuan, immediately rising by four jiao [cents], gradually rising to 69.6 yuan. Sentiment was extremely strong. In the afternoon, Xie Xingyuan continued to buy in. Dingkang, Houda, and Hongda also had needs. It quickly broke through the 70 yuan mark, hovering around 70 yuan several times. Later, as Jiufeng sold more and more, the multiple parties slightly retreated. As a result, the market price generally rose by 1.1 yuan to 1.9 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category  Highest  Lowest  Closing  Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A  76.30  74.50  76.00  Up 1.65</p>
<p>Unified B  71.50  70.00  71.10  Up 1.80</p>
<p>Unified C  70.30  68.10  69.60  Up 1.90</p>
<p>Unified D  66.20  65.00  65.70  Up 1.10</p>
<p>Unified E  69.80  67.80  69.00  Up 1.50</p>
<p>In stock trading, 100 shares of Ning Shao Shipping Company were traded at a price of 19 yuan.</p>
<p>The public market of Zhongye Public Institute rose and fell sharply, doing its best to change. The opening price did not fall sharply as expected by most people at the end of the week. The fall was less than 10 percent. The fear of the multiple parties gradually disappeared with the stability of other markets in the past two days. Therefore, shortly after opening, buying interest was revived, and the market rose instead of falling. By the time of closing at noon, the prices of various stocks had gradually exceeded the closing prices on Friday of last week. In the afternoon, it finally fell due to excessive gains, but the potential was still strong.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Banks Suspending Loan Collateral; Gold Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot red market for cash rebounded sharply and prices fell. Prices have retreated to within the 20,000 yuan mark. This is because it is widely rumored that banks have stopped making gold-backed loans. The confiscation of gold bars by customs on the Tianjin-Shanghai route confirms that gold is being transported to Shanghai. The Tianjin and Hong Kong gangs are selling a lot, so banks are still taking advantage of the opportunity to raise prices. Market prices have repeatedly fallen from 21,000 yuan to nearly the 19,000 yuan mark, with a low of 19,100 yuan, a sharp drop of 1,600 yuan. The market sentiment is very weak. The total transaction volume for the day was 13,400 taels. Jewelry fell by 60 yuan, totaling 2,000 yuan. Fine silver was lowered by 2 yuan, to 26 yuan. The gray market has fallen to 23.4 yuan.</p>
<p>Cash Enters the 20,000 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>From the morning, the market price of each bar (10 taels) was initially reduced to the 20,000 yuan mark for transactions due to the selling trend of Gonghe and other sellers, when there was a shortage of buyers. This was 1,300 yuan less than the noon close on Saturday of last week. After opening, Tianyuan, Mingfeng, and Dafeng began buying, which led to a sharp rebound. In an instant, it rose by 1,000 yuan, reaching 21,000 yuan. However, market sentiment was not strong. When Tianyuan came out again, Shih He, Yifeng, Yongcheng, and Xianghe also came to sell. Later, Mingfeng also sold. The price fell lower and lower, falling to 19,100 yuan. Although De Cheng, Li Tai, Mingfeng, and Tianyuan raised prices to 19,500 yuan, Shish He sold out. The noon close was 19,300 yuan. After the close, it retreated to 19,150 yuan, and finally 19,200 yuan. The market opened at 2:00 PM at 19,450 yuan, 150 yuan higher than expected. Next was 19,500 yuan. Xianghe and Shunyuan came to sell, falling to 19,200 yuan. Mingfeng, Dafeng, and Defu saw low prices and raised prices, rising by 550 yuan to reach 19,750 yuan. The market closed at 4:00 PM at 19,700 yuan, a decrease of 1,600 yuan compared to the noon close on Saturday of last week. The high and low for the day was 900 yuan. The selling price of the Jinniu cash shop was 19,900 yuan, 200 yuan lower than the purchase price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Down 160</p>
<p>After the price of jewelry per tael was exchanged, Datonghang and Xintonghang first reduced the price to 2,000 yuan in the morning, then rebounded to 2,050 yuan. It then fell to 1,960 yuan at noon, and rebounded to 2,000 yuan in the afternoon. The purchase price was reduced by 150 yuan, and the spot price was down 160 yuan. Fine silver has been lowered by 2 yuan, to 26 yuan. The black market has fallen to 23.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market for Foreign Exchange Eliminated; Only Selling, No Buyers in Private Check Transactions</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw flat listings from HSBC and the Central Bank. The prices of small counters such as HSBC did not change. The black market for British and American currencies has been officially and completely eliminated, with no price and no market. It was only heard that a Chinese broker in New York was offering US dollars at 3 yuan, and a British exchange was offered at 2 1/8 (also checked in the United States). There were sellers, but no buyers to offset them. No transactions were opened all day.</p>
<p>The foreign currency market yesterday saw both rises and falls. British and American gold pounds fell by 25 yuan each along with the cash price. British gold notes rose by 1 or 2 yuan. American gold notes once retreated to 31.5 yuan, with the final price being 33.3 yuan, up 0.1 yuan compared to last week. Hong Kong notes fell before rising. Japanese gold notes rose by 3 jiao [cents]. The evening market was as high as 3.5 yuan. Korean notes were stable. The evening market remained at the original price of 3.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Despite Price Controls on Various Items, Cotton Yarn Still Hits the Upper Limit</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been falling for several days, rebounded yesterday. However, actual transactions were still sluggish. In fact, the factory price of Shuangma has fallen by 800 yuan from its peak, which has led to profiteers covering their positions. With a tight market, the market price quickly rebounded. The highest price of 20-count Shuangma was 2,640 yuan, and the lowest price was 2,410 yuan.</p>
<p>The market sentiment for Shuangma was mostly optimistic at the opening in the morning. The first trade was high by 20 or 30 yuan, at 2,510 yuan. Shortly after, it rose to 2,545 yuan. After the high price appeared, active sellers began shorting. The opening of the exchange was also weak, and the selling pressure was strong. The market price then fell back to 2,450 yuan. In the second trade, the exchange suddenly rose, and the market sentiment followed, rising beyond the 500 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, the third close saw a pullback, and market sentiment was tired, falling back to 2,455 yuan. Unexpectedly, near 11:30, the trading wind in the market suddenly became fierce. There were quite a few buyers in the market, and the market price rose directly to 2,560 yuan, announcing an upper limit. The closing price was 2,538 yuan. It is estimated that 3,800 bales were traded in the first half of the morning.</p>
<p>The opening price in the afternoon was 2,520 yuan. Subsequently, due to the few sellers on the market and the large number of buyers, the chips were drying up. The yarn and cloth market of the exchange rose in a straight line. Market sentiment became stronger, and the market price rose to 2,640 yuan, declaring an upper limit. The final price outside the market was 2,615 yuan.</p>
<p>The futures market for Jin Shuangma has fallen to a relatively low level after a continuous decline. Although international trends are tense, most of the news is negative. Therefore, it is difficult to support under the panic of multiple parties. They successively came out. Although there were rumors of the withdrawal of US troops and other unfavorable rumors yesterday, the market trend was straight up. This is because the market price was too low, which attracted speculative attacks. In the afternoon, the factory prices rose sharply, and the long-term yarn also rose by more than 200 yuan. The recent term opened at 2,260 yuan in the morning, first rising by 35 yuan, then slightly falling to 2,195 yuan, and immediately rising again to 2,300 yuan. At the noon close, December opened at 2,380 yuan, once slightly lower, then rose again to 2,490 yuan. The distant term opened at 2,48 yuan at the noon close and rose slowly to 2,570 yuan. In the afternoon, as rumors improved, market sentiment was mostly excited. The margin was mostly long, so each month was nearly the high price. As a result, November rose by 185 yuan, December rose by 200 yuan, and January also rose by 200 yuan. A table is listed below.</p>
<p>November December January</p>
<p>Opening 2260.0 2280.0 2480.0</p>
<p>Highest 2425.0 2570.0 2650.0</p>
<p>Lowest 2195.0 2570.0 2460.0</p>
<p>Closing 2410.0 2565.0 2650.0</p>
<p>Comparison Rise 185.0 Rise 200.0 Rise 10.0</p>
<h3>Cotton Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cotton situation stabilized slightly with the yarn market. Transactions were slightly more active. However, prices were approximately 50 yuan lower than the previous week. In the afternoon, due to favorable rumors, the prices of yarn and cloth showed an upward trend, and market sentiment was revived.</p>
<p>Langgong 200 pieces 550.0 Haoshijia also 100 pieces 550.0 also</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose first due to purchases by peers, and then fell due to sales from New Orleans and the liquidation of bulls. As a result, the closing price was 5 or 6 pounds different from the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market fell first due to sales by professional merchants and the liquidation of bulls, and then rose slightly due to the strong rise in other vegetable raw materials such as flax and flax. However, the market situation finally fell due to the continued selling of oversupply. Yesterday's closing price fell by about 1 rupee each. It is also predicted that the market situation will fall by 0.25 rupees at the opening today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Strive to Show Off</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market opened flat yesterday, and rebounded in the afternoon. This was because market sentiment had stabilized slightly, and both new long positions and short covering were carried out. As a result, white goods, coarse and fine cloth, and twill rose by 3 to 5 yuan per piece. Bleached and dyed cloth also rose by about 5 yuan. Dyeing factories and wholesale shops on this street rushed to purchase. Transactions were even more active in the afternoon, with more than 600 pieces traded. Customer support purchased more than 300 pieces. This was thoughtful trading.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth The market rose sharply yesterday with the rise in yarn. The price of each piece of cloth in the exchange rose sharply by 6 yuan, 0.1 fen to 6.2 jiao. The leading fine cloth and the Four Gentlemen serge in the spot market fell before rising, with sharp edges. The closing price of the leader's factory order in the afternoon was 92 yuan, a rebound of 7 yuan from the end of last week. The smallest price of the Four Gentlemen serge in the morning was 3.03 yuan, and it rose sharply to 3.415 yuan in the afternoon, closing back to 3.37 yuan.</p>
<h3>Publicly Sold Rice Continues to Arrive; Foreign Flour Lacks Energy</h3>
<p>Foreign rice was unloaded from the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou Wheel from Hong Kong yesterday morning, with 10,200 bags of foreign rice, which are the low-priced small grains of the Public Concession. The wheel is now docked at the Pudong Wharf and will be moved to the Bund Wharf in Puxi for unloading within days.</p>
<p>In yesterday's rice market, foreign rice transactions were still completely suspended except for the gradual increase in the transaction of national rice. Normal transactions can be resumed only after the Public Concession issues instructions.</p>
<p>The flour market became more and more sluggish and listless yesterday. Tens of thousands of bags of foreign flour stored by the Beiyang Gang a few days ago were unable to be shipped out because they did not have the Public Concession's export permit. Customers not only lack the motivation to buy, but also want to sell. As for this street, in addition to a few necessities, most are waiting for the public sale of flat flour before adding supplies. Therefore, after the Golden Dragon brand was lowered to 36 or 37 yuan, there were still only a few decorations. Large households depreciated the price to 35 yuan, but there were still few takers. According to the highest opening price of the Jinlong brand, which was 60 yuan, the price has fallen by more than 41% at 35 yuan. However, wheat bran is in short supply and the price is standing firm. Small bags of wheat bran are sold for 54 yuan, and it has risen by half a yuan again.</p>
<h3>Wholesale of Oil Market Lacking</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were few wholesale transactions of miscellaneous grains, oil, and cakes, and most people were watching. Therefore, the market price fluctuated and there was little change. Tongshi sold 10 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 100 tins of Yantai raw oil, 300 tins of Jiangbei raw oil, and 150 tins of bean oil, 30 barrels of Dalian bean oil, 200 loads of Dayou factory Qing buckets, 100 loads of rapeseed oil, and 50 barrels of Rihua factory rapeseed oil. There are approximately 1,000 bags of corn in spot, and 50 tons in futures. There are still 100 yuan of Tianjin New Jinyuan asking to sell, and 923 yuan of green beans and 83 yuan of Guide Chen soybeans, but no transactions were made.</p>
<p>On the 17th, 5,560 bags of imported beans and 1,850 bags of raw peanuts were imported, all from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Candied Tangerines Offer New</h3>
<p>There had been no candied tangerines arriving for a long time because the old stock had been sold out. Therefore, the demand in northern China during the Mid-Autumn Festival was very urgent, but there were no goods to buy. Now that the production area has new goods, the first batch of dozens of pieces has been shipped to Shanghai for market testing. It was heard yesterday that the price was higher than the old goods by several hundred yuan.</p>
<p>On the 17th, northern goods were imported: 235 bags of walnuts, 8 bags of almonds, 400 bags of peanuts, and 280 bags of chestnuts, all shipped from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Isn't This a Great Opportunity? Major Players Buy Sugar at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market initially stagnated due to the opening of the company's futures market. Investor confidence was weak, and prices continued to fall. Later, as prices reached a considerable low, major players took the opportunity to buy, causing prices to rebound. The price difference reached as much as twenty-three to twenty-four yuan. The market seems to show signs of recovery. The October import price of the General Association's spot No. 24 raw white sugar started at 234 yuan in the morning, then dropped to 26 yuan, rose to 40 yuan in the middle, and then settled at 32 yuan. In the afternoon, it steadily climbed from 37 yuan to 49 yuan. September's prices ranged from 23 yuan to 35 yuan in the morning, and from 34.5 yuan to 47 yuan in the afternoon. Hong Kong raw sugar ranged from 205 yuan to 220 yuan. Dutch red sugar started at a minimum of 186 yuan, then rose to 90 yuan, and in the afternoon, it ranged from 91 yuan to 200 yuan. Taikoo refined white HX mark sugar was priced at 205 yuan. In the end, raw white sugar rose by fourteen to fifteen yuan to ten yuan, Dutch red sugar rose by fifteen yuan, and refined white sugar rose by five yuan. Total transactions exceeded 15,000 bags.</p>
<p>A large batch of imported sugar has arrived. Taikoo Company's Jia Ying and Qiong Zhou vessels arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 12,000 bags of sugar from Hong Kong. The Jia Ying vessel carried 5,600 bags, and the Qiong Zhou vessel carried 6,400 bags. They docked at our company's wharf in Yangjiadu, Pudong, for unloading. (Hua)</p>
<h3>Strong Demand for Black Tea for Medicinal Purposes</h3>
<p>In the past two days, transactions of foreign black and green tea have become increasingly scarce. This is due to the tense situation in the Pacific and the difficulty in securing space on American ships, causing American sales to virtually halt. However, sales to stores and tea merchants have become more active recently. Yesterday, merchants from Tianjin purchased more than 260 packages of fried green tea, priced from 300 yuan to 320 yuan. In addition, the sales of black tea cores are even brisker. Besides large purchases by stores, local Western pharmacies have a greater need for them. Yesterday, 170 dan were traded, with the market price soaring from 1780 yuan to 230-240 yuan, an unprecedented high price.</p>

<h3>Old-fashioned Weapons of Animals</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Living in this world of survival of the fittest, an animal, if it doesn't want its species to become extinct, must be equipped with a superior weapon, whether for offense or defense. In reality, there is no such thing as new or old among these various weapons. Classifying them strongly into new and old is merely judging them from our own perspective. I will now select a few interesting ones to write about below. As for tiger claws, wolf fangs, horse hooves, bull horns, etc., of course, they are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>Lance</p>
<p>In the Arctic Sea, there is a type of cetacean called the "Narwhal." It is about sixteen to seventeen feet long, shaped like a fish, grayish-white in color, with countless spots on its back and flanks. However, the most peculiar thing is the long lance protruding from the upper lip of the male – a tooth! – This lance is about eight to nine feet long, made of ivory, delicate and solid, standing straight forward, and the shaft is also decorated with rope-like patterns that twist to the left! What is this thing for if not for battle? That's why I say this is a warrior wielding a lance.</p>
<p>Saw</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean or Atlantic Ocean, there is a strange-looking fish belonging to the shark family called the "Sawfish," also known as "Sawshark." This fellow is about two zhang long, with a reddish-brown back and very broad pectoral and pelvic fins. But the most surprising thing is its deformed long snout: this snout can grow to more than six feet long, flattened, with countless neat and sharp teeth arranged on the upper and lower sides. Wouldn't you say this is a large saw? A French natural scientist named Lacepede in the early nineteenth century described its story of attacking whales, so one can imagine its danger!</p>
<p>Sword Wielding</p>
<p>The powerful weapon of a crab is the pliers formed by the first pair of front legs, which, once clamped, will not let go. These are called "crab claws," or what people now commonly call "pincers offensive." However, there is a small brownish-yellow crab, only two inches in size, whose male has one claw that is particularly long, reaching two to three inches. Zuo Si's commentary says that it is "as sharp as a sword," so it is called "sword-wielding." Duan Chengshi's "Youyang Zazu" says that its two claws are used "to fight with the larger one and to eat with the smaller one." ... We can imagine how majestic this sword-wielding hero must be when fighting in the water!</p>
<p>Axe Wielding</p>
<p>"Youyang Zazu" says: "The mantis has an axe." The Song Dynasty scholar Lu Dian explained: "People in Yan call it 'giant axe.' Its arms are like axes, and when swung, they always strike without avoiding..." According to the description of French insect experts: the shuttle-shaped section in the middle of the mantis's forelimbs is actually a large saw with two layers of serrated teeth; the outer layer has four serrations, the inner layer has twelve serrations, black and long, green and short, alternating in length, and three sharp needles at the rear. The last section is also a saw with two layers of serrated teeth, but the teeth are smaller and denser. The limb ends also extend sharp and curved scythes. Therefore, the mantis uses its forelimbs to hook, pierce, cut, tear, and pull, truly a perfect and dangerous weapon. Fabre said that the mantis is a fierce tiger and demon in the peaceful insect world! According to Thomson, the mantis in South America is strong enough to catch a small bird!</p>
<p>Shooting</p>
<p>Among marine plankton, there is a colorless and slender rod-shaped small worm, about two and a half centimeters long, with bristles and small spines on its head, and lateral fins on both sides of its body. This thing not only looks like an arrow, but its movement and predation are also sudden advances, just like an arrow flying from a bow, so it is called "arrow worm": it may not be entirely unreasonable to use it as an archer now.</p>
<p>Snaring</p>
<p>The definition of the word "yi" is: "to shoot with an arrow tied with a rope." This kind of weapon can also be found in animals. For example, those bizarre chameleons that are good at changing colors each possess a long tongue longer than their bodies: usually curled up and hidden in the mouth, when it encounters a preyable insect, it suddenly bursts out like a whirlwind and returns like lightning, because the tip of the tongue secretes an extremely viscous liquid, and insects rarely escape being carried away by it. According to records of the biological world, there is a type of chameleon in southern Spain that is only five to six inches long but can use its tongue to capture objects eight to nine inches away, and it only takes a few tenths of a second to go back and forth!</p>
<p>Life</p>
<h3>Record of Failure</h3>
<p>— Feile</p>
<p>This young man is preparing to take his first step in life. His mind is drawing a beautiful "Road of Life":</p>
<p>Blue sky: no sign of rain.</p>
<p>Spring breeze is blowing,</p>
<p>Flowers and grass surround:</p>
<p>A half-flat and wide road.</p>
<p>Adorned with happiness, peace, and success,</p>
<p>Leading straight to the other end!</p>
<p>He doesn't feel his impulsiveness at all, he thinks there really is such a road waiting for a group of lucky people. Who says that an ideal life is not what people should have?</p>
<p>He starts walking.</p>
<p>The waves of life begin to hit this proud young man. He opens his eyes and realizes a little: the sky is not always blue every moment!</p>
<p>Taking another step:</p>
<p>He encounters a great mountain, towering into the clouds; he encounters deep water, flooding the ocean, and his feet cannot help but stop!</p>
<p>Perhaps he hopes for an airplane to carry him over, a steamer to ferry him across, but; the high mountain tells him that the successful climb up by grasping vines.</p>
<p>The deep water tells him that the successful swim across.</p>
<p>Strength, sweat, blood, tears, he exchanged for a new understanding:</p>
<p>"Only through struggle can there be a way out."</p>
<p>Struggle is not always a victory. Failure follows him continuously. He resents failure, once, twice, again and again, he becomes discouraged, he becomes somewhat passive?</p>
<p>But, when he understands the true meaning of life, he no longer hates failure. Every failure becomes a precious record.</p>
<p>——Oh, how many times have I failed! Not a sigh, but a cheer! He might even say like Steele:</p>
<p>"I doubt whether this success is reliable, because 'failure' is not enough to record!"</p>
<p>He did not tear up the picture drawn on his mind, he said:</p>
<p>"The blue sky is not absent, the flowers and grass are fragrant and beautiful!</p>
<p>The road of life has happiness and peace!</p>
<p>But, all this is earned through struggle – fighting</p>
<p>Even more so, it is exchanged for;</p>
<p>Gray skies, thorny roads, tears, sweat, and blood</p>
<p>——Records of failure!"</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>He ends his life with a metaphor:</p>
<p>"This steed has finally won!</p>
<p>But, can you see the whip marks on its flanks?</p>
<p>Life is a race, not a lottery!"</p>

<h3>Transparent Furniture Cover</h3>
<p>— Yongyun</p>
<p>To keep the exquisitely woven sofas and cushions on display in stores intact and clean, there is now a transparent rubber cover. This cover can also be used at home because it can keep the sofa clean without losing its beauty. Even sitting on it will not damage the cover. Moreover, this cover is non-flammable, odorless, washable, and durable.</p>
<h3>Autumn Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fourteen: The Life of a Hero</p>
<p>But when he returned to the small inn where he was staying, he absolutely did not shed another tear. On the contrary, he put on a happy face and ate the bowl of noodle soup that Mei Bao had prepared for him in three or four mouthfuls.</p>
<p>"My interpersonal relationships are not bad. My colleagues are very kind to me and willing to take care of me." He leaned back on the couch, looking at Mei Bao, who was cleaning up the chopsticks and bowls. "People who sing in Shanghai, after coming off stage, all like to show off. I've been out of practice for more than ten years, so the first day I went on stage, I inevitably felt particularly tired." "Hopefully, it will get better in a few days," Mei Bao said casually.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it won't be easy!" The future hidden worries are deeply buried in Qiu Haitang's heart. Although he doesn't want to say it, he can't help but think of it immediately.</p>
<p>This thought is certainly correct! The situation on the second night and the third night did not improve at all. The insults from his colleagues and the excessive fighting almost made Qiu Haitang fall ill.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the martial arts manager saw through Zhang Yincai's intentions on the third day and knew that he had mistakenly thought that Qiu Haitang was someone he had introduced, so he deliberately caused trouble. However, he was still the martial arts manager, and Zhang Yincai was just a martial arts leader. They had always had some grievances with each other, so he certainly couldn't speak well for Qiu Haitang directly to him. (265)</p>
<h3>Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Mingyi</p>
<p>History teaches wisdom, but not everyone is learning. Fabre</p>
<p>Science teaches us how to cure diseases and how to kill lives. It fragmentarily reduces the mortality rate and then kills us in batches in war; but only wisdom – a desire organized by all experiences – can tell us when to cure diseases and when to kill. Durant</p>
<p>Silence is like a marble statue that a great sculptor has not yet started to carve, full of potential intelligence and wisdom. Huxley</p>

<h3>Writing Before the Premiere of Princess Iron Fan</h3>
<p>— Liyi</p>
<p>China's first full-length stereoscopic cartoon with sound, "Princess Iron Fan," is about to be released, which is exciting news! The preparation and shooting of "Princess Iron Fan" started several years ago, and the production work has taken years and months, exhausting the efforts of the Wan brothers and 120 artists to complete. This also shows how meticulous and solemn the filming of the film is!</p>
<p>This is a unique flower in the Chinese film industry! This is a kind of attempt by Chinese filmmakers, and there is no doubt that this new attempt will not fail. We admit that Chinese films are far more immature than those in Europe and America, but we have our own path. Does immaturity not have a time to mature?</p>
<p>After watching "Snow White," "Pinocchio," "Gulliver's Travels," and other full-length cartoons, even if we don't gasp in admiration, we should at least be amazed by the great achievements of film art. The artistic evaluation of cartoon films should be above ordinary films. Can we say that? The achievements of "Princess Iron Fan" are not yet clear to the public, but we think it will not disappoint, because it is not a crudely made film. Some Chinese films are often crudely made products, which cannot but be regrettable!</p>
<p>The special commendable point of cartoon films, in addition to the moving images and pleasant music, seems to be the exaggeration of the plot. Therefore, in terms of subject matter, fairy tales are the most suitable. However, if you say that cartoons must be fairy tales, it is certainly not necessarily correct! Here, we have a request, and we hope that Chinese cartoon authors will accept it, that is, the subject matter may as well be fairy tales, but if, in order to cater to the tastes of a small number of people, the content is overly entertaining, resulting in the loss of educational significance, then this mistake is by no means insignificant. Because, although not all viewers of cartoons are children, it is absolutely true that children love cartoons. If a cartoon only gives children "laughter and a few cheers," isn't this a waste? Of course, "Princess Iron Fan" is definitely not this type of film.</p>
<p>Secondly, we hope that the Great Shanghai and Huguang theaters will have a special preferential treatment for children when "Princess Iron Fan" is released, and do not have the exceptional provision of "full tickets for children" as when "Snow White" was released. In this way, children will naturally have more opportunities. Finally, in addition to sincerely introducing "Princess Iron Fan," we also sincerely hope that the Wan brothers and 120 artists will make greater efforts to create works even greater than "Princess Iron Fan"!</p>
<h3>Entertainment News</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The League of Nations' giant film "Home" is currently being rushed to produce an English copy for public screening in the United States.</p>
<p>The first debut work of Lianxing Company has been changed to "Bi Xue Qian Qiu," with Ying Yin and Mei Xi playing the leading roles.</p>
<p>Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun's plan to go to Hong Kong has been abandoned, and they will independently produce "Little Tiger."</p>
<p>Before Chen Yunshang returns to Shanghai, Wan Cang has decided to first direct and write "Childhood China" (Note: The film was planned to be filmed before the war, and Jin Yan and Li Keng were originally scheduled to star, but it was abandoned for some reason.)</p>
<h3>Why Did Ah Q Die?</h3>
<p>— Beishi</p>
<p>This is indeed a question, why did Ah Q die? Of course, Mr. Lu Xun used the typical figure in the small rural village—Ah Q—to expose the society in the feudal system, and to painfully criticize the general national character. With Ah Q's death, he hoped that the Ah Q in everyone's consciousness would die, but why did Ah Q have to die?</p>
<p>Was it for joining the revolutionary party? No, was it for robbing the Zhao family? No, was it for molesting Wu Ma? No, let alone the reason for being shot. Everyone knows that Ah Q died, but they don't know why Ah Q died, what was the crime? Mr. Chen Yu's adaptation of "The True Story of Ah Q" is divided into five acts. In the fifth act, he even collected Mr. Lu Xun's works outside of "The True Story of Ah Q," such as "Diary of a Madman" and "Medicine," and interspersed them in the play. Therefore, for Ah Q himself, it is easy for the audience to despise the past, and thus he dies in a muddle. Although, everyone knows that he himself shouted: Twenty years later, I will be a good man again!</p>
<p>"That's right, I know that the robber was not Ah Q, but, alas, Mr. Zhao, to be honest, I have been in office for so many days, and these petty things have not yet been solved, so, my reputation, wouldn't it be bad? Everyone would say that this Qian director is simply a piece of trash, who can't even manage the security of a small village properly. What great things can he do in the future? He even spent so much money to study law and politics abroad. In this way, alas, Mr. Zhao, you think, wouldn't it be terrible? Therefore, I chose Ah Q to be a scapegoat—anyway, this guy is a poor rogue with no home, no room, no support!"</p>
<p>Do you understand now, Ah Q's death?</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Nineteen: Dusk, the Hu Cavalry Dust the City</p>
<p>The reason why San Gui said this was that he wanted to ask the Qing army not to violate anything, not to disturb the officials and people, and to avoid the ugliness of him opening the door to welcome the invaders. How did he know that Dor Ershui also had great expectations for entering the pass this time, and wanted to do some hypocritical things to win people's hearts, and could no longer plunder as a means as in previous battles. Moreover, the opponents were bandits who were accustomed to slaughtering, so of course he had to make it clear so that he could distinguish them, and also let the people of the Ming Dynasty not resent their brutality, and feel that they were replacing violence with violence. There was no need for Wu Sangui to teach them anymore. After Wu Sangui issued the book, scouts repeatedly reported that the Qing army was approaching Shanhaiguan. It was also heard that the bandit Li Zicheng personally led a large army across the Ao River, and marched mightily towards Shanhaiguan. He then ordered the vanguard Ma Bao and Bai Xianzong's two armies to move as quickly as possible to the right wing. He heard that the bandits had left the pass from another road, and the situation was urgent, so he and Chai Ying led 500 personal guards to the outside of the pass to ask Prince Regent Dor Ershui to move his troops into the pass. Dor Ergun's subordinates strongly advocated that when the bandits launched a large-scale attack, they could send a mighty army to raid Juyongguan from another road, and directly attack the capital. The capital was empty and could be obtained easily. If the bandits returned to rescue, they could be captured in one fell swoop. However, Sangui still insisted on entering the pass to fight the bandits because the bandits were approaching, and the situation at the gate was urgent. Dor Ergun then ordered Prince Ying Ajige and Prince Yu Duoduo to lead 10,000 cavalry each to enter the pass from the east and west water gates. He personally led the main force to follow. Sangui was overjoyed, so he returned to Shanhaiguan to prepare to welcome the Qing troops. On the 23rd day of April, the Qing army had opened to Shanhaiguan. (222)</p>
