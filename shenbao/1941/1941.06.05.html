<h3 id="c15">軸心兩巨頭會晤歐戰前途 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>本星期一日希特勒與莫索里尼又在勃倫納山隘作第六度的會晤，按之往例·彼兩人每度會晤之後，必有重大動作隨以俱來，以是軸心之即將在最近採取新的攻勢原在世人豫想之中、這情形並未因義大利　勢的失墜血有所改變。但以希特勒天才戰略之卓越，他每逢有所企圖，往往都以出其不意來取勝，而對於世人所共司猜到的方策則避之若俛、有如所謂今年的春季攻勢，迄不曾在大西洋沿岸和英倫海峽爆發，而此次之以嶄新　略與偌大代價以攻取克里特島，則又為一般所不曾料到。就目前形勢看：自然是東地中海的塞浦洛斯與叙利亞等地最為吃緊，但如果說就是為了繼續東進而兩巨頭纔舉行會商。似乎並非必要。這一疑問姑且留給希特勒自已去解答，這裏且就歐戰整個形勢略事檢討。</p>
<p>在最近一年，希特勒已獲得了打破即史紀錄的成就，而且其成就並非偶然倖致，而泰半得力於戰略的優良和行動的機敏。這一點即在反對他的人也不容否認。不過若從地域的分野來看：則他的成就却只限於歐洲大陸，除却東北的蘇聯，西南的伊此利安半島，與夫彈丸之地的瑞上和尙木能越雷池一步，其是否也能同樣有所成就，尙須等待新的試騐來解答。固然其對挪威與克里特的攻佔都越過了一海之隔，但嚴格說來，斯坎的那維亞半島並不能勉强與歐洲大陸分離，而克里特島距離希臘—尤其是距離德國佔領下的愛琴　島不過一衣帶水、是以並不能引這些事實證明納粹海外活動的成就。從已律的經過情形看，在歐陸而外，軸心實屬無往而不失敗，存款的凍結，商船的沒收，猶其小者。義大利的東非帝國之全告瓦解，較之前次大戰中西南非洲德領的命運，史為悲慘：近虫火藥庫已在伊拉克爆發，但不　　即被英方有德軍大舉赴援之前予以敉平。整個的美洲，現在都或多或少的和納粹站在對立也立，世界其他部分的政治單位，也泰半與軸心為敵，，只有一固苦戰而疲的日本，是茫茫廣宇間德義所　可引以自慰的友國。不過日本此際所追求者第一是目身的勝利和擴展，其所以與軸心結託也只是為了實現比一、企圖，而不是一定在感情上對於極權國與民治國有所軒　。從然連日日方將謀積極牽制美國之說甚囂塵上，却始於不能與美國之無條件支援作戰的民治國家日將其自身命運聯　在一起者所可同日而語。綜上所述。　　這一年中·希特勒在歐陸着成功，在歐洲以外却一無成就，其唯一　作的三國帝盟·並未因而獲得助力，因而引起的反動力却H益增强，寢至使另一强國走到參戰邊沿。控制了整固歌陸，其勢自未可輕侮，而以一個歐陸去與以外的全世界為敵，以在海上絕無力量的軸心，於此怕也要感到著　吧？</p>
<p>目前納粹所掌握的實力，控制歐陸已綽有餘裕，要應付歐陸以外的問題則仍感小足；如其真如昨日合瓦圻　肖息所傳：希莫將準備從事進行歐洲的新秩序則另當別論，如其對於敗英一念依舊鍥而不舍，則其比後之從何處下手，正是個絕大難題。塞浦洛斯叙利亞埃及直布羅陀都可能被選取作進攻對象，而且也都不無獲逞的可能，但對於這有如百足、虫的英國，要想從割裂肢體面制其死命，正非易事、即使經過長久時間，到雙方實力都耗折不堪也未必竟能達到目的。克里特島鏖戰的結局，是德軍得到成功，那種孤注一擲不惜消耗的戰咯實屬不足為訓，經比試騐而後，進侵英倫一舉怕史未必能輕加嘗試。如納粹此後戰略仍只着重於地中海與近東覇權的爭奪，則不顧已方實力分散的弱點，一味把戰局延展擴大，那至多只能算是鞏固歐陸佔領區的外圍，距離擊牧英國的目標則愈趨愈速。</p>
<p>現節段的歐戰，在歐陸範圍之內，固無用武餘地，在歐陸外圍—英倫三島是例外—亦度缺少具有央定作用的因素存在。蘇聯的實際參戰，不到最後關頭大約不容想像；在目前只有西則美國，東則日本，　是潛在着的重要力量，且已都臨到參戰的邊沿，要在此、一′問題上獲得有利的發展，纔足以左右前途的休戚；而美國的關係尤非日本可比。希特勒與墨索里尼此度會淡之是否措意及比不可知，但即使他們注意到了，却也缺乏控制前途發展的力量和把握，這是軸心當局所無可如何的。</p>

<p>歐戰消息向來都側重地中海方面，可是英國政府中人却知道，即邱吉爾首相也曾說過，「一切都以大西洋之戰的勝負為　移。」</p>
<p>英德兩國在這决震古爍今的戰爭中，方作生死存亡的鬥爭，其戰塲範圍非常廣大。這裏是一個數千方哩一望無際的水面，籠罩着濃霧，有的地方風濤險惡，有的地方則碧波澄淸，如作淺笑，還有若干地方，黑暗陰沉，似在皺眉。</p>
<p>然而這戰塲的廣大還小止此。雙方僅在海上作戰，英國的搜索艦追逐着德潛艇，德國的剽襲艦也向英國的護航隊突擊。戰事並巳深入後方，直達英國和平的鄉村，農民們正在那裏戮力耕種。實際上戰事且已達到了英國的每一個家庭。總而言之，這大西洋戰事，今日正在天空海面和海底同時進行着。</p>
<p>在英國的某一個入口處，護航隊正在努力前進。行駛較快的船隻滅低速度，以等候行駛緩慢的姊妹船。開道艦上閃閃發出憤怒的光芒，一位年老的海軍將官—也許是一位退伍的海軍將官從　軍聯歡社裏安樂椅中被發掘出來的—在舵樓上碟　往來，咒詈着他所率的艦船，不能像他昔日所統率的地中海艦隊那樣按步就班。前面和左右南旁都有驅逐艦潛行照料，像牧犬跟踪肥壯的老牝羊羣一般。上面還有一架赫特生轟炸機，或是一艘海岸空軍司令部的桑特蘭飛船，嗡嗡作聲，打着盤旋，隨着護航隊前進，同時搜索海面。</p>
<p>一根不刺目的小黑桿突出海面，轉瞬便不見了。上面的瞭望員　時緊張起來，一面打着轉，一面高聲的怒吼着。但見水面上一連串的水泡，直向護航隊中一船襲來。她急急避讓，可是已經來不及了。氣笛方嗚，一個巨大的魚雷，轟然一聲已把她攔腰截斷。海面上頃刻間佈滿油跡。當她下沉的時候，小船紛紛放下，載人逃生。全隊中的其他各船，像發在似的曲折駛行，以避襲擊。</p>
<p>隨行的驅逐艦繞着圈子，海面上留下一道道白痕。護送的飛機亦在上面盤旋不定。</p>
<p>驅逐艦的舵樓上，一個人頭上套着聽筒，發着簡單的命令。艦長向電話機中說了一個字，重又發出信號。後面起了兩個尖銳的爆炸聲。驅逐兩邊，各飛出一顆深射彈。瞬息之間，海水飛躍，如用匙擊漿菓時，菓汁叫濺的情景一樣。其餘各艘驅逐艦，也像水蛇一般的轉頭向該彈爆炸處直駛，那時，好像全部海水都在翻騰了</p>
<p>或許一無所獲，這種狩獵便告中止。或有一條雪茄烟式的東西冒出水面，砲聲便繼着深射彈的爆炸並發。或有少數驚悸落魂的船員，死裏逃生，倖而得救。當夜倫敦海軍部發出公報，謂有敵方潛艇一艘被燬。</p>
<p>但倫敦航運部中，同時也有面角沉鬱的官員正在船舶表上劃去又一船船名，飛機製造部和陸海軍部中則燈光明亮，因飛機，槍砲或原料等項的損失，忙着重新調整他們的記劃。</p>
<p>另一方面，駑駛員舒適地靠着坐椅，飛行員搬弄着儀器，轟炸員向瞄準器探望，機身後面飛行塲上的燈光，漸趨黯淡而終於不見了。這架飛機是以德國潛水艇據為巢窟的一個港口為目標。經過一小時的黑夜飛行，巳到法國海岸上空，在高空向羅里特前進。遼遠見有一綫光芒，飛行員高興地呼了一口氣，駕駛員知道這光是先一小時同伴所放之火，便向起火處疾飛猛進。</p>
<p>飛機翱翔於德國勒萊頓尼上空機首在火光上面停止，這時火勢已逐漸加大，不僅是一綫光芒了。火焰亦淸晰可見，並有許多黑影。</p>
<p>駕駛員點點頭，便把控制機向前扳動。機身開始府衝，下面的高射砲火也一時並發。砲彈在飛機的上下四周，爆成</p>
<p>球的火花，機身也震盪異常。探照燈光在天空中四面掃射。駕駛員發現了目標，於是傾斜，轉折，更低的滑下。</p>
<p>投彈員俯伏機首，一只眼由瞄準器張望，並向傳聲筒不斷的傳呼，「向　，向右，向左一些，再向右，向前，向前，向　」等口號。</p>
<p>他突然按着機括，炸彈便一個一個的掉下去，機身同時躍起。信號桿掉落船塢，爆炸聲便繼續不絕，火星直衝霄漢。</p>
<p>控制桿向後扳轉，機身直向上升，一至高處，又掉頭向下，照前如法泡製。最後牠升至探照燈和高射砲的射程以上，便轉首回營。後面則見火光熊熊，照耀天際。回營途中，或與擔任同一任務的飛機相　，也說不定。决晨回到轟炸機司令部，同時德國潛水艇用以襲擊大西洋航路的根據地，遭受轟炸的報告，也接一連二的傳到了。</p>
<p>德軍和被徵用的法國人，救了一夜火，到第二天早晨，便奔走於被毀損的房屋　港之間。傾欹的船只都被拖入船塢。水閘和船塢的門或需修理。言火熊熊，破壞隊淸除頹垣殘壁之時，軋軋機聲或者又充滿空氣中了。</p>
<p>再另一方面，泰晤士河口的水面，受着月光照耀，泛成一片銀色。若干哩外的海港，在黑夜中靜靜等候着，遠處海上，德機正向　河口前進，空中傳來飛機嗡嗡之聲，逐漸增强。不一會，機身下降，炸彈門也開啟了。在月光映照之下，一枚磁性水雷掉了下來，水雷上，降落傘自動張開，使水雷輕輕降到海面，不致在未觸海底以前，即行爆炸。（未完）</p>

<p>惠樂園係美國婦女佈道會之產、位於南市麗園路、環境幽越、占地六畝牛、曠地旣宜耕作種蔬、兼可飼鷄養兔、補助生產、牛工半讀、洵為兒童之樂園、地主鑒於該會救濟貧苦兒童、原屬慈善團體、自願貶價、以美金三千兀指售、爰經集議發行股夯、廣為勸募、希海內外仁人君子、本己饑已溺之旨，慷慨解襄、成此善舉、茲將「上海兒童保育會勸慕認購惠樂園股票辦法」錄下、</p>

<p>繳款辦法茲為適應捐購股票諸君繳款便利起見、除一决繳足者外、可於一年之內分若干期付款、以資通融、繳款處圓明園路一六九號四樓該會、</p>
<p>專家估計根據建築工程師楊寬鱗之估計、報告惠樂園之售價、至為低廉、僅以房屋建築一項而論、即不止此數、此外何况尙有空地數畝、並知爭購此產者頗多、產權人良以本會係屬救濟慈善團體、自願貶値婦由本會承購、</p>

<p>— 李毓鏞</p>
<p>花生一名長生果，贛州志云：「落花生」一名長生果，蓋取蔓長象徵長生之意。英文稱Mandubi，地果（Gronndnut），硬殼豆（Peanut）或猢猻果（Monkeynut，……大多數以特性而得名。學名叫Arachis　Hypogeae，這後一字就是地下的意思，和我國所稱「地豆」「地果」之類相彷彿。花生這一種奇異的結果狀態，很能引人注意，在西洋，邊沁的「巴西植物志」始記之。李調元「南越筆記」則謂「花不能成萊，其莢乃別生根莖間，掘沙取之，殼長寸許，皺絞；中有實三四；似蠶豆……凡草木之實皆成於花；此獨花自花，莢自莢，花不生莢，莢不帶花，亦異甚！」其實其異於他花，不過在花梗伸長，子房在地下發育而已，雨村所記，未免言之過甚了。</p>
<p>花生的原產地，有人以為非洲，有人以為南美，曾爭論過一百年，至今尙無定論，但大多數學者相信南美一說。十八世紀林那（Linnaeus）以為產蘇利那姆（Surinam），巴西及秘魯，但未言是吾野生·一八一八年布期（R．Brown）「剛果植物誌」以為或自中國傳入印度錫蘭及馬來，但以各方面看來，上述各地似非原產之處。巴西最早有花生記戰，故自非洲至南美亦殊不確。斯普楞咳爾（Sprengel）謂狄奧夫斯拉圖（Theopreastus）記花生在埃及栽培，不知是吾即今花生。果然今埃及當有而福爾斯考爾（Forskalls）及得利爾（Deliles）名錄中却並朱脫及，想不可靠。布氏以為自中國傳人南美而再至非洲，亦不能得有確切的考證。</p>
<p>德宜多爾（DeCandolle）氏從語言及考證上研究，以為原產在南美，地說：馬克格累夫（Marcgraff）及派案（Piso）記載並晝就巴西一應用植物名Mandubi，似於原產，又引蒙那（Monardes）謂秘魯名之為Anchic，的瑟阿科斯達（Acosta）記南美有名Mani者。德氏說如果花生早為埃及或阿刺伯人所知，亦信原產非洲之說。但希臘拉丁阿刺伯學者甚至福爾斯考細都不記，可知起源不早，至起源亞洲也無事可證，吞堡（Thurnberg）「日本植物誌」，福爾斯德（Forster）記太平洋羣島文中皆告缺如，布累得什奈得（Bretchneider）謂中國古籍中無花生之名，連十六世紀本草綱目中尙無之。反而有人在巴西發現同屬六種，又有人在安定鎭（Ancon）秘魯人一古墓中找到花生種子，足為原產南美說的佐證。至現在普遍栽培的花生，野種何在，殊為疑問，以花生特異的「自植」性質，如晚野種已滅，勢不可能。有人說西印　有脫離栽植而返野生者，據德氏的意見，它是十五世紀間由買奴者帶到幾內亞，由葡萄牙人帶到亞洲南部，才有道樣繁榮的局面的。</p>
<p>或　花生最早發現於西印度的聖多明各，（北美內亂時）維基尼阿省的花生區域被軍隊占據，和平後，軍隊把花生種子帶回作紀念品，繁殖遂廣。於是傳入南美，擅香山而到印度的盂打拉斯，加爾各答，一直到蘇門答臘，歐洲最後種植的是意大利西班牙兩國。它的利用，據說還是　得角（Cape　Verd）加里（Goree）地方僑民的伯特（M．Jaubert）首先發見的。我國花生概自明發曆中輸入，的當西元1576-1619。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c94">相反的態度 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>現代敎育兒童的一個基本原則，是指導的，誘掖的，而不是强迫的，壓制的。負敎育兒童的責任的人，最忌開口「不要這樣那樣」，閉口「不計如此這般」。多用獎勵與讚許的語氣是校聰明的。</p>
<p>今日極權國與民主國對民衆的態度，其不同也正在這裏。極權國政府希望民衆掩耳閉目，祗聽政府發言人的話，不許聽外國的無綫電廣播，不許看外國報紙雜誌，祗許歌功頌德，不許出一句怨言。民治國家則不然，長衆有言論出版閱書讀報聽無綫電廣播的自由。在美國，像林白與惠勒這種孤立主義的「反動分子」，居然還能够公開演講，如果生在極權國家，若不「身首異處」，也早已置身集中營了。</p>
<p>美國政府當局對林白的冉三諷勸，不施行任何的壓力，正表現了父兄似的寬宏大量的民洽精神。從心理與敎育的原則上說起來，這種態度是較正確的。</p>
<p>這兩種相反的態度，正表現了極權國與民治國精神上的不同。</p>

<p>— 蕭仲納</p>
<p>我兒子的媽：</p>
<p>昨天鄕人帶來一個信，說你已經安抵老家了。據說你的媽很高興，嫁出丟時是一個人，回來時已經拖二只小犬了。我希望我的那位仁慈的岳母到了厨房裹時，還是一樣的高興，那我就謝天謝地了。</p>
<p>上星期日你中學時代的友伴徽和　她們來看你。我說你回到老家去照顧孩子去了，她們證着眼瞧瞧我，嘆息似的說：「愛麗終究給趕到廚房裏去了。」好像我就是希特勒了。其實就是也沒關係，不是我們政府裹的大人物也有這樣主張的嗎？後來她們逼着我說出你返鄕的原因，我就吿訴他們因爲你生產的綠故，缺課太多，把這只神聖的小學敎師的鉛粉飯碗打碎了。一個月少了二十五元錢收入，我們幸福的小家庭無法支持，你也祇得回到娘家去了。她們聽了，黯然別去，徽的眼睛還有些濕呢！你說好笑不好笑？</p>
<p>喔，我忘掉吿訴你一件要事，對於我確是天大的要事。　天老爺大發慈悲，不知怎的敎育部會發下一百四十元救濟費，我分到了七十五元正，我眞是却之不恭受之有愧。你生產時欠的六十元錢債還淸了，多下來十五　預備放在銀行裹，將來作爲孩子的敎育費，你贊成嗎？</p>
<p>你臨走時說過回到老家後，假如日子過小下去，預備把新生的嬰孩給人，自己做奶媽去。起先我極力反對，以爲有損我們的身份；靜下來想想，倒也無所謂了。而且『幼我幼以及人之幼』的精神是値得歌頌的。所以我現在百分之百的贊成了。</p>
<p>近來我的肝火很旺。昨天上課時斥責了一位學生少爺，他簡直擋着我說：『你神氣甚麼？我家裏的的車夫也比你强得多呢！』他的理由是充足的，我看在一個鐘　七角錢的面上，氣也平了。我笑了笑，他們也哈哈地笑笑，於是我又在黑板下了×＋YXO一類東西，不過手有些顫抖就是了。你想倒我隱忍的功夫的進步，一定會高興的，是不是？</p>
<p>阿大怎樣了？我看到馬路上小癟三，就會想起他，我把香烟的畫片一張張地積起來，預備給他做看圖識字的敎材。你看，我做父親時總算盡職了</p>
<p>你說你現在一天三餐多吃粥，我想粥容易消化，很合衛生之道的。再見你時，你大概會胖了些。</p>
<p>祝你時時快樂！</p>
<p>你的丈夫。</p>

<h3 id="c97">便衣警察 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 煥鈞</p>
<p>警寨和偵探在職務上旣有重大的區別，所以便衣警察就不能指謂即是偵探。在美國的各地方，馬路上除了指揮交通的人員以外，就很少見到穿制服的警察，而由便衣警察擔任巡行各馬路的責任。這種警察，雖不穿制服，而身畔也都佩帶手槍，警笛等必需之物，碰到路人有發生爭吵或打架的情事，便上前執行職務，出視證書後，（證書上貼有該警察本人的照片，每張都編着號碼），就事理加以調解。假如當事人不肯聽從的話，再把兩造帶到就近的警所裹去，秉公辦理</p>
<p>便衣警察在辦事的使利和效率上講，的確勝過穿制服的多多，如發生普通爭鬧的案件，便衣警察先在一旬不動聲色地觀察事態的進行，聆取兩造爭執的要點，可以預先獲得比較正確的口供；如馬路上正在發生搶刦兇殺一類重大的罪行，那麼便衣警察可以出其不意地將罪犯加以逮捕，盜犯往往因不提防而易於就擒的；所以美國當局歷次研討下來，一致認爲便衣警察的設施，裨益於社會很大，是値得加以提倡的</p>

<h3 id="c98">鐳錠避難 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 勞神</p>
<p>在倫敦空襲聲中，保障鐳錠的安全成爲醫界最車要的問題。全英國所有的鐳錠一共不過一十八公分，其中倒有十分之八存貯在倫敦的五家大醫院中。這些稀有的藥品倘若不幸被炸彈所擊中而毀减，那麼不僅鉅萬的金錢將化爲烏有，同時千萬癌症的病人都將陷入不救的絕境，還有更危險的事，就是當鐳錠受到轟炸時，它不會化爲烟燼；任何猛烈的破壞力不能使它絕減，鐳錠就是被炸成一陣飛灰，每一粒灰還是一粒完好的鐳錠。這種鐺的飛灰倘若充滿在空氣中，或者混入於公共的水源中，就可以使全城的人或全區的人遭受可怖的危害。鐳的放射能是異常偉大的，即使是極微的是在人體中也能肆其摧殘的暴力。鐳　入人體　，藉血淚的流佈迅速地就堆積在全身的骨骼上，從此全身就像埋了無窮的炸彈，每一個鐳的原子就是一顆炸彈，於是不斷地爆炸，爆炸……任何人都不難想像其最恢的結果。</p>
<p>唯其如此，倫敦每一家保存鐳錠的醫院就必須小心翼翼，替它築個特別堅固的地窖，並且裝置十分安全便利的升降機械，以便在警報驟發時迅速歸藏原處，鐳錠的體積十分渺小，但保存時却耍用笨重的，極厚的鉛盒密閉起來，因爲鐳的射綫穿透力極强，倘若不用厚金屬把它阻擋，就有外洩灼傷皮膚的危險。</p>
<p>鐳的放射能大的每經一千七百年消耗原來的一半，這樣經過三萬五千年就差不多完全變成了鉛。氣是一種鐳所放射出來的氣體，它的放射性能和鐳不相上下，因此醫院中通常把這種氣收集起來，封閉在小管中，放到癌或瘤的深處，以代鐳錠作治療之用。氣比較起來短命得多，只有三天又十九小時的有效時間。</p>
<p>直到最近，全世界所有的鐳還不過兩磅（九百公分），價値一千八百萬元美金。</p>

<p>世界上有兩種不幸的人：一種是無靈感的『活死人』，他沒有慾望，對一切的事物，他都沒有興趣，他不愛他的生命，但是他極怕死。另一種是饕食似的『猴子』，他的慾望是無窮盡，一天到晚『東鑽西跑』，挖空腦袋，絞盡腦汁，拼命的『弄噱頭』，『鑽念頭』。</p>
<p>世界上同時也有兩種幸福的人：一種有勃勃的生氣，他有自己奮鬥而即得的希望，這希望也是由他日常改進，埋頭實幹而得到的。另一種人的生活像一座機器，慢慢地推進着，不擾亂，不幻想，他能「知足」。—法Montesquieu　．</p>

<p>「七爺，銀行裏的事可有什麼消息嗎？」趙四突然挿嘴着問。</p>
<p>「這個倒不成問題。我的朋友才有電話來，吿訴我明後天他們就可以把摺子補給你了」接着，他又邊頭去向玉崑說：「你來了很好，快幫着趙四把他家裏的事弄好了，一同趕回天津去，讓他也好放心……。」</p>
<p>玉崑和趙四都忙着應了一聲是。</p>
<p>「我自己簡追沒有臉再給他寫信了。」紹文又補上一句。</p>
<p>「這是什麼話？七爺，你爲了老三跌進這個地方來，就是做老子的待兒子也不過這樣了！」玉崑笑着說。</p>
<p>趙四正用一條手巾在擦抹臉上的汗珠，聽了玉崑的話，也忙連連點頭，表示附和的意思。</p>
<p>紹文紙微微一笑，便故意把話又到了別處去。</p>
<p>平日趙四見了紹文原是不大敢說話的，這時候他混身披掛，就是坐着不動，汗已經淌個不停了，因此他爽快連一句話也不說，儘讓玉崑和紹文連續着談了幾十分鐘。</p>
<p>臨走，紹文送他們到院子裏。</p>
<p>「吿訴玉琴，」他悄悄地向玉崑一個人說：「還有一件事我不能再替他辦了，勸他息了這個念頭吧！」</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>最　好萊塢影城中的援華運動，盛極一時。跟着童星秀蘭鄧波兒代表美國兒童向中國兒童致敬之後，大明星克勞黛考爾白又在電臺上官讀宋慶齡女士的函電。這是一個引人注意的消息；因此，筆者很高興把克勞黛考爾白的種種，介紹給本刊讀者。</p>
<p>出身法國</p>
<p>說起了克勞黛考爾白，也許每一個影迷都知道的，在銀幕上面，她能說一口流利的英語，但人們也許不會知道她不是美國人，更不是英國人，而是法國人呀！她的父母也是法國人，於一九一三年時，她們舉家由法遷美；因此，她所　的敎育，也就完全在美國。這原因，她能說一口流利的英語，使人不會知道她是法國人，但她對於法文也有相當根底的。</p>
<p>愛好繪畫</p>
<p>常她什求學的時候，心理並不想做電影明星，而她的　願，是成爲一個藝術家，因爲她素來愛好繪畫。但事情有出於意外者，有一次她遇見了一個美國的紅伶，就在她主演的劇本裏面担任配角，正和別人一樣，起初是失敗，所演的劇本竟沒有一部成功。直到後來才在舞臺上聞名起來，更由舞臺轉上了銀慕，幸運也接着開始了。</p>
<p>拍片經過</p>
<p>克勞黛考爾白自加入電影界之後，第一部作品是和賓李昂合演的，接着又演第二部，但這兩部影片完全沒有成功。直到後來，在「雨」一片中演出之後，才聞名起來。從此飛黃騰達，一變過去的消沉，不久就成了好萊塢紅女星之一。到了現在，對於她，可算每一個人留有深刻的印象了。</p>
<p>榮獲金獎</p>
<p>此後克勞黛考爾白不但在銀幕上獲得盛名，就是演技力面，也跟了時間進步。在很短的一個時期中，她　三次獲到世界電影藝術科學研究院的褒獎。最値得一提的，便是一九三三年度，她和克拉克蓋博兩人，以合演「一夜風流」而同時獲獎。至於她的私生活，和別的明星不同，主張儉樸，平日對於慈善事業，非常熱心。但看她這次對於援助中國，也使我人特別感到興奮哩！</p>

<p>於是柳隱　和許靖各人坐下，王永泰也在一旁陪坐。柳隱英笑了一笑說道：「今日小弟曾於無意中竊聽得靖哥在書室中自嘆自語，雖然不明白其中事故，而知你必有一件心事急於辦夫，遂於夜間注意靖哥的舉動。在你室後有一扇門是由廚房的，小弟就在那邊竊視，果然見你悄悄出外，要下山去走一遭了。小弟生性好奇，喜管閒事，所以立即帶了我的白龍寳劍，緊緊跟在你的後面，一路下山。你扒進城牆，我也照樣扒進。你到這裹老英雄的府上時，越牆而入，我也越牆而人，直跟到你立在樓窓之前向內窺探。」柳隱　說到這裹，許靖把手拍着自己的膝蓋說道：「賢弟的飛行功夫比我高出數倍，否則一路跟在我後，我怎麼一些不知道呢？慚愧之至。」王永泰也點點頭，撚着鬍鬚微笑。柳隱英又接着說道：「那時小弟年輕好弄，忽想和靖哥遊戲一番，試試你覺察不覺察，遂輕輕跳至你的身後，乘機抽去你背上的赤鳳寳劍。後來你覺察了，向我追來，我便引你到後邊去，要想問你一個究竟。却不料在那時候，我眼角上瞥見東邊有一條黑影，竄進墻裹去，頓使我又起了好奇之心，不及和你說明，立即丟了你，隨着那黑影重又掩人。只見那黑影東張西望的是在探察路徑，我跟了他走。他正如靖哥一樣，並未覺察後邊有人，走至一個庭心前，飄身而下，我立在屋上，默覘動靜。見下面廂房裹有燈光透出，知道裏面有人。那黑影在窓前窺探了一回，立刻從他腰際拔出一柄扑刀來，似乎要入內動手的樣子。我料他是一個客到此來下毒手的。湊巧身邊帶得鏢囊，遂掏出一支嚮鏢來，乘他沒有防備的當兒，向他下部發了一鏢，正中他的大腿，他遂喊了一聲啊呀，立刻栽倒在地。我跟着跳下去時，王老英雄已從室內聞聲躍出了。」（八一）</p>

<p>Washington – Today, according to an official announcement here, ships flying the American flag will replace British ships operating between North America, Australia, and New Zealand. Well-informed sources say that the United States taking over all transportation operations between North America and Oceania can be expected and roughly foreshadows the complete withdrawal of British shipping from all shipping activities outside the war zone. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – It was announced yesterday that American ships will operate between the U.S. and Canada, and on all British shipping routes connecting to the opposite side of the globe. This will allow twelve British ships to be redeployed to the Atlantic. Secretary of the Navy Knox warned that the current state of British shipping is extremely serious. The United States must accelerate shipbuilding and must "embrace the determination to eradicate the tragedy now unfolding in the world." The Secretary also revealed that several American cargo ships have been converted into aircraft carriers. (International News Service, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt met with the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Winant, for an hour yesterday. Hopkins, who is in charge of the lend-lease program, was also present. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – After a long talk with U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant yesterday, President Roosevelt immediately discussed matters with Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. It is reported that the Admiral is a key figure responsible for implementing President Roosevelt's promise that American goods should safely reach Britain. Secretary of State Hull also met with the British Chargé d'Affaires in Washington, Butler, and Hall, the representative of the British Economic Warfare Department. Washington regards this conversation as considering a substantial plan to prevent goods from being indirectly transported from South and North America to Axis countries. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the United States is currently planning to prevent militarily important raw materials from entering Germany via South America and the East. It is said that the government is paying great attention to this issue. The House Rules Committee yesterday planned to convene American military and government officials for a hearing before discussing and studying the issue of military raw materials flowing into Axis countries. Senator Bilbo, Democratic Congressman Coffee, requested that the committee approve a resolution to establish a special investigation committee (composed of five senators and five congressmen). He said that this investigation is actually to prevent military raw materials from the Western Hemisphere from flowing into Axis countries. He also stated that he would like to amend the resolution to include the Soviet Union within the Axis countries. It is also learned that the committee is scheduled to hold an executive meeting today to consider this resolution. Many believe that these people will try to determine President Roosevelt's attitude towards the investigation matters. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of the Navy Knox delivered a speech yesterday at a shipbuilding industry association meeting. Congress should launch a competitive system among private shipyards to create miracles in building ships to supply Britain and the United States. Knox said, "We must resolutely participate in the tragedy that is currently unfolding; otherwise, we and our descendants will spend the rest of our lives resisting enemies who dominate the entire world outside the United States. The world situation is now filled with crises for the people, and all the things that we consider to be of great value are in danger of being destroyed. We cannot further proclaim this matter. We must fight twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week." A spokesperson for the Shipbuilding Industry Association, Condo, said, "The shipbuilding industry has accepted this challenge and will implement it." (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>New York – According to the results of a recent public opinion poll, 52% of Americans support U.S. warships escorting ships and transporting weapons to Britain, 40% oppose it, and 8% are undecided. This poll was completed before the President delivered his fireside chat last week. According to reports, twenty-one months ago, when the war first broke out, 84% of Americans voted that American ships should not enter the war zone. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Harrisburg – Two Pennsylvania state representatives have submitted a bill requesting that Congress approve the transfer of the newly built 35,000-ton battleship South Carolina to the British Navy. (Reuter, 4th)</p>
<p>New York – The American Export Lines company announced yesterday that the U.S. Navy Department has immediately requisitioned two new ships from the company, one being the "Export" and the other being the "Exchequer."

U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall said that the U.S. Army currently has twenty-seven infantry divisions, four armored vehicle divisions, two and a half cavalry divisions, and five tank battalions. Ten more tank battalions will be organized on June 1st, and two new armored vehicle divisions will be established this autumn. (TASS, 3rd)</p>
<p>U.S. Orders Large Batch of Giant Bombers</p>
<p>Washington – The U.S. Army Department announced yesterday that it has signed contracts with United Aircraft Corporation and Boeing Aircraft Company to manufacture new four-engine long-range bombers, with a total value of approximately $132,878,000. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – The Army Department has newly ordered a large batch of aircraft, estimated to include approximately 800 giant bombers. One batch was ordered from the Consolidated Aircraft plant in San Diego, valued at $126,636,200. The other batch will be built by the Boeing Company in Seattle, at a cost of $95,241,6969. It is rumored that this order aims to promote President Roosevelt's plan to produce 500 giant bombers per month. The Army Department announced the two large batches of aircraft orders yesterday afternoon after news broke that three major aircraft manufacturers, Douglas, Boeing, and Vega, had decided to merge all their resources to accelerate the production of a single type of large bomber.

<p>Washington – Speaker of the House Rayburn stated yesterday that he believes the administration's property requisition bill should be amended so that the government's requisition of property has a time limit. Many believe that this statement by the Texas Democrat shortly after consulting with the President is highly significant. Rayburn stated that the current wording of the bill seems unclear because it does not clearly state whether the President's requisition of property is limited to the period of national emergency or is permanent. Undersecretary of the Army Patterson said that he hopes Congress will quickly pass this new bill, which Patterson submitted to Congress on behalf of the Navy and Army departments. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt stated yesterday that the government's property requisition law's ultimate goal is to give the government full power to obtain national defense contracts. The President meant that defense officials want to have the power to deal with situations not covered by the conscription provisions of the current Selective Service Act and other laws. The President said that he cannot say whether he believes the national defense program must have the power to permanently requisition property. He said he cannot offer specific criticisms of the wording of the law. (Associated Press, 4th)</p>

It is reported that American pilots have been going to China in small batches for at least three months. When the other planes currently en route arrive in China, China will form a powerful air force to counter Japanese bombers attacking Chongqing and the Burma Road. Many believe that once the Chinese Air Force is restored, it will be able to fully protect supplies passing through the Burma Road and deter Japanese aircraft from risking bombing Chongqing and other places again. It is reported that most of the aircraft currently en route are high-speed Curtiss F40 fighters. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Axis Powers’ Two Heads Meet to Discuss Future of European War <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>On the first day of this week, Hitler and Mussolini had their sixth meeting at the Brenner Pass. According to past precedents, every meeting between the two of them is followed by major actions. Therefore, it was widely expected that the Axis powers would launch a new offensive in the near future. This situation has not changed due to the decline of Italian forces. However, given Hitler's brilliant military strategy, he often succeeds by surprise whenever he has an intention, and avoids the policies that the world commonly guesses, such as the so-called spring offensive this year, which has not yet broken out on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel. This time, the capture of Crete Island with a brand-new strategy and a huge price was also unexpected. From the current situation, the most urgent areas are naturally Cyprus and Syria in the eastern Mediterranean. However, it does not seem necessary for the two heads to hold consultations simply for the purpose of continuing the eastward advance. Let us leave this question to Hitler himself to answer, and here we will briefly review the overall situation of the European War.</p>
<p>In the past year, Hitler has achieved record-breaking achievements, and his achievements are not accidental, but mostly due to excellent strategy and agile actions. Even those who oppose him cannot deny this. However, from the perspective of geographical division, his achievements are limited to the European continent. Apart from the Soviet Union in the northeast, the Italian peninsula in the southwest, and the small areas of Switzerland and [unintelligible] which cannot cross the boundary, whether he can achieve the same achievements still needs to wait for new tests. It is true that his capture of Norway and Crete both crossed a sea, but strictly speaking, the Scandinavian Peninsula cannot be forcibly separated from the European continent, and Crete is only a narrow strip of water away from Greece – especially from the Aegean islands occupied by Germany. Therefore, these facts cannot be used to prove the achievements of Nazi overseas activities. Judging from the past course of events, the Axis powers have failed everywhere outside Europe. The freezing of deposits, the confiscation of merchant ships, and even smaller incidents are still happening. The complete collapse of Italy's East African empire is even more tragic than the fate of German Southwest Africa in the previous world war. The nearby powder keg has already exploded in Iraq, but it was quickly quelled by the British before large-scale German reinforcements could arrive. The entire American continent is now more or less in opposition to the Nazis. Most of the political entities in other parts of the world are also enemies of the Axis powers. Only a struggling and exhausted Japan is the only friendly country that Germany and Italy can take comfort in in the vast universe. However, what Japan is pursuing at this moment is first and foremost its own victory and expansion. Its alliance with the Axis powers is only to achieve this goal, and it is not necessarily due to emotional differences between totalitarian and democratic countries. Although the rumors that Japan will actively contain the United States have been rampant in recent days, it cannot be compared with those democratic countries that unconditionally support the war and link their own destiny with it. To sum up, in this year, Hitler succeeded in Europe, but achieved nothing outside Europe. The only alliance of the three powers did not gain any assistance because of it, and the resulting backlash has become increasingly strong, to the point where another powerful country is on the verge of joining the war. Controlling the entire European continent naturally cannot be underestimated, but facing the rest of the world with a European continent, and with the Axis powers having no naval power at all, they must be feeling pressured, right?</p>
<p>The strength that the Nazis currently possess is more than enough to control the European continent, but it still feels insufficient to deal with problems outside Europe. If they are really preparing to engage in a new European order, as yesterday's rumors from [unintelligible] claimed, then that is another matter. If they are still determined to defeat Britain, then where they will start next is a huge problem. Cyprus, Syria, Egypt, and Gibraltar could all be chosen as targets of attack, and there is also a possibility of success. However, for Britain, which is like a centipede, it is not easy to kill it by severing its limbs. Even after a long time, and with both sides exhausting their strength, they may not be able to achieve their goal. The outcome of the Battle of Crete, where the German army succeeded, and the strategy of betting everything regardless of consumption is not to be followed. After this experiment, the attempt to invade Britain may not be easily tried. If the Nazi strategy continues to focus on the struggle for hegemony in the Mediterranean and the Near East, then regardless of the weakness of its own scattered strength, and simply extending and expanding the war, it will at most only be considered to consolidate the periphery of the occupied areas of Europe, and the distance from the goal of defeating Britain will become more and more distant.</p>
<p>In the current stage of the European War, within the scope of Europe, there is no room for force, and outside the periphery of Europe – with the exception of the British Isles – there is also a lack of factors that play a decisive role. The actual participation of the Soviet Union is unlikely until the last moment; currently, only the United States in the west and Japan in the east are potentially important forces, and both are already on the verge of joining the war. Only by achieving favorable developments on this issue can the fate of the future be determined; and the relationship with the United States is far more important than that with Japan. Whether Hitler and Mussolini took note of this in their meeting is unknown, but even if they did, they lack the power and confidence to control the development of the future. This is something the Axis authorities can do nothing about.</p>

<p>As a result of Japanese air raids in Chongqing, many Chinese merchants have suffered losses. However, some clever merchants have capitalized on the bombing season by renting out lanterns. The past Japanese bombings often cut off power lines, which took months to repair. Therefore, many residences and shops had no choice but to temporarily use oil lamps and candles. A certain well-managed business purchased many gasoline lamps and rented them out for 30 yuan per night. Restaurants, markets, and large shops found these oil lamps very useful, and the lantern rental business thrived. Currently, a unique scene in Chongqing is that every night, shops send people to deliver two or three lanterns to their customers. (4th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e33">Britain's Active Military Deployments Resolute to Defend the Near East Will Declare Syria as Enemy-Occupied Territory To Consolidate Control Over the Eastern Mediterranean Beirut Oil Depots Bombed Twice by British Aircraft <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>London - Well-informed sources in London anticipate that the War Cabinet will soon decide to declare Syria as enemy-occupied territory, allowing British forces to launch a large-scale offensive into Syria. Hitler and Mussolini's sixth meeting since the start of the war has led to widespread speculation about the Axis powers' next target. Observers believe the Axis leaders intend to advance through Cyprus and Syria to Iraq and Palestine, aiming to cut off the British Air Force's communication in the Middle East before the Axis forces in Libya attack the Suez Canal. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters military correspondent reports that although the fall of Crete is unfortunate and increases the difficulties faced by the British Navy, Britain remains the master of the Mediterranean. Effective air support is a necessary adjunct to naval warfare, and its effectiveness depends on the presence of extensive airbases. This is something the British Navy is well aware of. The British Navy's base in Alexandria has a long coastline for protection, with airfields along the coast. The plains adjacent to the coast can also be used to build more airfields as needed. The Mediterranean coast forms a triangle, with Egypt to the south and Palestine and Syria to the east serving as its aerial shield. Within this triangle lies the island of Cyprus, which is owned by the British and can also be used as an airfield to strengthen British air control in the eastern Mediterranean. However, if the Vichy government allows the Germans to station their air force at Syrian airfields, this control will be greatly weakened. This is what Britain must do its utmost to prevent, hence the need for immediate action without hesitation. Weak measures must be abandoned. The Vichy government can be seen as unfriendly to Britain, but Vichy is not supported by half of the French people or half of the French army. This half of the military and civilian population hates the Nazis and is willing to join the democratic countries in the war as soon as they receive assistance. The Free French leader in the Middle East, General Catroux, is in Egypt, and General de Gaulle is probably there as well. Now is the time for the Free French to immediately occupy Syria. If the British Air Force is firmly positioned along the entire coast of the eastern Mediterranean, from Aleppo to Haifa, and is protected by the bases in Iraq, the Persian Gulf, and Cyprus, then the naval base in Alexandria will be as solid as a rock. Failure to quickly occupy Syria will hinder everything. Now that the situation is precarious, Britain must not hesitate to use its authority. Once the Syrian airfields are in British hands, control of the eastern Mediterranean will be assured. (4th Reuters dispatch)</p>

Reliable neutral diplomatic sources strongly claim that three German mechanized divisions and two battalions of light tanks, along with paratroopers and blitzkrieg experts, have arrived in Syria.

<p>Italian Territorial Demands on France Believed to Be Under Discussion</p>
<p>The "Lausanne Tribune" in the Swiss capital recently reported that after French Associate Darlan made a speech in Paris, the leaders of Germany and Italy met in the Brenner Pass, which has raised some subtle questions. The most likely is the question of Italy making territorial demands on France. The purpose of Italy's participation in the war is to dominate the Mediterranean, so it has to demand that France transfer important bases along the Mediterranean coast to Italy. However, Associate Darlan said in a speech on May 23rd that Hitler had not demanded any colonies from France and that France had no intention of giving up sovereignty over any of its territories. It can be seen that this meeting of German and Italian leaders must be related to Italy's demands on France. (3rd Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest - Political observers here say that although Italy's goal is to expand its territory, it may abandon certain demands on France in consideration of French-Spanish cooperation, so as to concentrate its forces on operating new territories in the eastern Mediterranean.

Its importance seems to be above the issue of US intervention, the situation of French-German negotiations, and future combat plans. For example, according to a dispatch from a "Yomiuri Shimbun" reporter stationed in Rome, German and Italian authorities recently conducted talks, and the German side tried its best to encourage the Soviet Union to supply Germany with wheat from Ukraine and oil from the Caucasus, so as to avoid taking "tough actions." Another Allied News Agency reporter in Berlin said that what Hitler and Mussolini discussed was what "tough suggestions" to make to the Soviet Union in the political, economic, and military fields.

<p>Building a New Order in Europe Is Being Studied Meticulously</p>
<p>Swiss Capital - According to sources from Rome, the issues discussed by the leaders of Germany and Italy in the Brenner Pass are gradually becoming clear. The results of the meeting may be officially announced as a prelude to peace. For example, the "Tribune of Rome" published news about the Brenner Pass meeting under the title "The Cradle of the New Europe," and said that Britain has been driven out of Europe, and Europe itself can build a new order. Therefore, for Europe to move from a state of war to a state of peace, it must wait for the Axis powers to achieve final victory. The semi-official "Italian People's Daily" also stated, "What should be discussed at this meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy is not only the issue of war, but also the issue of the reconstruction of Europe after the war." In addition, the "Telegraph News," the organ of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, also said, "The decisions made by the leaders of Germany and Italy have extremely important implications for the development of the future situation." In this regard, the authorities of Germany and Italy have already believed that the current European war is about to come to an end, and they can begin their work of rebuilding Europe. This meeting of the leaders of the two countries is probably a study of this possibility. (3rd Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>London - According to news from Vichy, the French cabinet met twice yesterday to discuss events such as Franco-British relations. The nature of the importance is not concealed by the Vichy side. A semi-official communiqué announced that the second cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon was "worthy of attention." At the first cabinet meeting yesterday morning, Chairman Pétain and Weygand, who flew here from North Africa, also attended. The general public is particularly concerned about Weygand's attendance, because Weygand is not only currently serving as Vichy's chief representative and commander-in-chief in North Africa, but before returning to the country to succeed Gamelin as commander-in-chief of the French region, he served as commander-in-chief of the Middle East Allied Forces, with headquarters in Syria. Moreover, Weygand served as Chief of Staff to General Foch during the Great War and is very familiar with the British. A section on discussing Franco-British relations in the French official communiqué is seen in this way. The communiqué stated that Vice Premier Darlan made a statement on Franco-British relations before returning to Vichy. "The French government is studying the situation created by this." In addition, the Lyon Radio Station stated that the cabinet meeting in the afternoon was chaired by Darlan and convened after continued talks between Weygand and Pucheu.

<p>Doorn, Germany's abolished Emperor Wilhelm II, passed away here at 11 o'clock this morning. Except for a small number of German "royalists," the abolished emperor, exiled here, had been almost forgotten by the world. The abolished emperor was eighty-two years old and had been suffering from pulmonary vascular obstruction for several weeks. The funeral is now scheduled to be held here tomorrow. It is said that before his death, the abolished emperor left a will, wishing to be buried in Doorn rather than return to Germany for burial. The abolished emperor was once accused by the world of being responsible for the First World War. Now, during the Second World War, he suddenly passed away. This gray-haired old man was the last emperor of Germany. When he ascended the throne in 1888, he was determined to emulate Wilhelm the Great and make his name known in history. However, thirty years later, the forgotten abolished emperor had become a rural gentleman living in the Doorn villa in the Netherlands. Although the abolished emperor was in exile, there were still a few royalists who admired him as the supreme ruler. The abolished emperor fled to the Netherlands on November 10, 1918, because his army was plotting a rebellion. Therefore, the abolished emperor fled in fear of his life. When the German army occupied the Netherlands in May last year, it passed through Doorn without disturbing the abolished emperor. (United Press dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>London, according to an official announcement from Berlin today, the abolished German Emperor Wilhelm II passed away at 11 o'clock this morning after a long illness, at the age of eighty-two. Before his death, he expressed his wish to be buried in Doorn, and his descendants will follow his wishes. Wilhelm was the grandson of Queen Victoria of England and the nephew of King Edward VII of England. He was the most hated person in England for several years. Wilhelm was the initiator of the European War in 1914. At first, he was unstoppable, but later, due to the adoption of unrestricted submarine warfare, he angered the United States and resolutely joined the war, and Germany began to collapse. Revolution broke out in the country, and Wilhelm had no choice but to flee to Doorn, the Netherlands, to pass the time by logging. The establishment of the Treaty of Versailles declared Wilhelm a war criminal. On January 16, 1920, the Allied countries formally requested extradition, but were rejected by the Dutch government. In February 1940, newspapers in New York published an unexamined letter from Wilhelm to his friend Petchero, stating that the warring countries should stop the war and jointly assist Finland to save the world and civilization from the spread of Bolshevism.

<p>A Brief Biography of Wilhelm II</p>
<p>Berlin, Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, passed away at 11:30 this morning in the Doorn Mansion in the Netherlands, at the age of eighty-two. The Emperor was born on January 27, 1859, in the Crown Prince's Palace in Berlin. His father was Crown Prince Frederick (who later ascended the throne and reigned for only 100 days), and his mother was Princess Victoria, the daughter of Queen Victoria of England. The Emperor's childhood teacher was Xingzi Peter, who enlightened his interest in social issues and guided his development of physical education. Later, he studied at Kassel High School and passed the exam with distinction. After graduation, following the Prussian custom, he joined the army as an officer in 1877 and was promoted rapidly. In 1880, he was promoted to Lieutenant General of the Army and was responsible for commanding the Second Army Brigade. The Emperor studied law and politics at Bonn University for two years. In 1880, he married Princess Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein and had six children. The Emperor ascended the throne on June 15, 1888, and was called Emperor Wilhelm II. The Emperor disagreed with Prime Minister Bismarck, and Bismarck resigned on March 20, 1890. In November 1918, a revolution broke out in Germany. On the 10th of that month, the Emperor went abroad to take refuge in the Netherlands. Finally, he abdicated on the 28th of that month. In 1920, he moved into the Doorn Mansion. In April 1921, his original wife passed away, and he remarried the following year. His second wife was Princess Homeming. Since moving to the Netherlands, the Emperor has not been involved in politics, but he is very concerned about the strength of Germany. (Haitong dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Nazis Conduct Extensive Propaganda Activities in Syria, Striving to Sow Discord Among the Faithful, Distributing Food to Show Goodwill to the People <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Istanbul, it is learned here that the German side is conducting quite active propaganda among Muslims in Syria, making extensive incitement on the issue of Jews, and distributing food. One hundred and twenty carts of sugar, wheat, rice, and aviation oil have arrived in Aleppo. The food is distributed to the people, and the gasoline is kept for the use of the German Air Force. As far as the local ethnic groups are concerned, experts believe that Syrian Christians are openly pro-British. Even among the Shia Muslims in the minority ethnic groups, the Sui propaganda has not been successful. As for the French in the area, their emotions are mixed. It is heard that the French authorities in Syria recently dispatched three French fighter jets to drive away British aircraft over the Lyak flight port. Two of the French aircraft actually flew into Palestine to join the British side. The main oil refinery in Tripoli, Syria, was severely damaged in early May. Those who have recently come to Turkey from Syria say that whoever occupies Syria first, whether it is the Central side or the Sui side, will encounter very little resistance, because the people of Syria seem to hate Vichy's mismanagement and welcome the rapid restoration of law and order. There are no German soldiers in Syria yet, only a large number of German air force personnel and airport service staff. However, according to a Syrian expatriate, the Germans are becoming more powerful and active. The British should not delay any longer. The Germans are trying their best to provoke discord among the various religions, so if riots and infighting occur among the various religions at any time, it is expected.

<p>Washington, "Scripps Howard News Service," is a famous commentator, Sims. He wrote yesterday that the American military believes that the Axis powers have made various indications to prove that they have decided to take preemptive measures against the United States, trying to force it to join the war before the United States is ready. Sims said that the military believes that this decision was made by Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass meeting. He also said that many Axis leaders firmly believe that now is the time to drag the United States into the war. Many Japanese leaders also support this view. These leaders believe that the current arms production in the United States is very small. Once the country joins the war, it will not be able to help Britain. Sims also said that the right to preempt is undoubtedly in the hands of the Axis powers. Hitler can pull the United States into the vortex of war at any time he deems appropriate. He also said that President Roosevelt had guaranteed that he would not send troops to participate in the war unless attacked, but said that he would ensure that American aid would reach Britain. Germany and Italy have been thinking about the United States joining the war for several months. They have repeatedly decided to instigate Japan to drag us in. Japanese politicians are not so foolish as to do this. They want the war to progress further. However, now that Germany has rescued Italy, the Balkans have been pacified, Britain's lifeline has been threatened, and France has allowed cooperation with the Axis powers in the Atlantic, the Axis powers can drag the United States into the war at any time. It is rumored that Hitler has decided not to allow Japan to have any more excuses for staying out of the war, and believes that since the Axis powers will eventually fight the United States one day, it is better to do it before the United States is ready.

<p>Japan's Pro-German Faction Will Have New Activities, Targeting the Dutch East Indies as the Next Goal</p>
<p>London, according to Reuters' Far East correspondent, after observing various phenomena, the pro-German faction, incited by the German fifth column in Japan, is now preparing to have new activities in the Far East. Now that Japan has achieved its goals in Vietnam, it is targeting the Dutch East Indies as the next goal. President Roosevelt's speech last week did not mention escorting or joining the war, which the Japanese were very pleased to hear. The stock market prices rose unanimously. If the American president had mentioned escorting or joining the war, Germany would have forced Japan to fulfill its obligations under the Tripartite Pact and declare war on the United States. At this time, the German ambassador to Japan, Woerthe, hurriedly went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Matsuoka, and told him in affirmative terms what Hitler expected of Matsuoka. The next day, Matsuoka published an article, stating that he believed that the rumor that Japan's attitude towards the Tripartite Pact was indifferent was false, and declared that it was absolutely impossible to have the illusion that Japan would not faithfully fulfill its obligations under this pact. At the same time, the Dutch East Indies government's firm rejection of Japan's demands has aroused the Japanese government's anger, and given the pro-German faction an opportunity to show its loyalty to the Axis powers on the one hand, and to seize practical benefits on the other. At the end of last week, the Japanese government formally notified the Dutch East Indies, asking it to reconsider Japan's so-called insincere attitude. Japanese newspapers said that they had asked Britain not to obstruct the agreement between Japan and the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese-Dutch negotiations began in October last year and have been dragging on until now. Japan has gained nothing except more oil supply. The attitude of the Dutch East Indies has always been consistent. It is willing to trade on the basis of good neighborliness, but insists that goods transported to Japan must not be transferred to Germany, and that Japan must not transport its own goods to Germany in the same way, and take Dutch East Indies goods to make up for its lack of ancestral guarantees. It is unwilling to accept Japanese demands of a political nature. Matsuoka's remarks a few months ago, listing the Dutch East Indies within the scope of Japan's East Asian New Order, have made the Dutch East Indies very dissatisfied. At that time, the Dutch government issued a statement in London, refuting it severely. The Dutch East Indies' attitude is firm for two reasons. One is that the United States has very large interests in the Dutch East Indies, estimated to be worth no less than 1.5 billion US dollars. The Dutch East Indies' rubber exports to the United States account for 38%, and the Dutch East Indies' oil production controlled by the United States accounts for 40%. The United States also has automobile factories and shipyard in the Dutch East Indies. The other is the deployment of military equipment in the Dutch East Indies. Since October last year, it has gathered a large army and imported a large number of new aircraft from the United States to strengthen its air force. Although the Dutch East Indies navy is small, it is quite efficient. The Dutch East Indies has also disguised its factories, implemented blackout controls, and severely cleared the fifth column, and has already taken precautions, not only relying on the support of the United States.

<h3 id="e49">Talks on the European War (6) (1) A Comprehensive View of the Atlantic War <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>News of the European War has always focused on the Mediterranean, but people in the British government know that even Prime Minister Churchill has said, "Everything depends on the victory or defeat of the Atlantic War."</p>
<p>In this unprecedented war, Britain and Germany are engaged in a life-and-death struggle, and the scope of the battlefield is very broad. Here is a vast expanse of water covering thousands of miles, shrouded in thick fog. Some places have dangerous winds and waves, while others have clear blue waves, like a shallow smile. There are also some places that are dark and gloomy, as if frowning.</p>
<p>However, the vastness of this battlefield is not limited to this. The two sides are only fighting at sea, with British search ships chasing German submarines, and German raiding ships also attacking British convoys. The war has also penetrated deep into the rear, reaching the peaceful villages of Britain, where farmers are working hard to cultivate. In fact, the war has reached every family in Britain. In short, this Atlantic War is currently taking place in the sky, on the sea, and under the sea at the same time.</p>
<p>At a certain entrance in Britain, a convoy is working hard to move forward. Faster ships slow down to wait for their slower sister ships. Angry lights flash from the leading ship. An old naval officer—perhaps a retired naval officer who has been unearthed from an armchair in the military fraternity—paces back and forth in the wheelhouse, cursing the ships he leads for not being as methodical as the Mediterranean fleet he once commanded. There are destroyers lurking and taking care of them in front and on the left and right, like sheepdogs tracking fat old ewes. Above, there is also a Hertson bomber, or a Sunderland flying boat from the Coastal Air Force Command, buzzing and circling, following the convoy and searching the sea.</p>
<p>A small, inconspicuous black pole protrudes from the sea surface and disappears in an instant. The lookout on top suddenly becomes tense, turning around and roaring loudly. A series of bubbles on the surface of the water rush straight towards a ship in the convoy. She dodges urgently, but it is too late. Just as the whistle blows, a huge torpedo cuts her in half with a deafening roar. The sea surface is instantly covered with oil. As she sinks, small boats are lowered one after another to carry people to escape. The other ships in the team zigzag like crazy to avoid the attack.</p>
<p>The accompanying destroyers circle around, leaving white streaks on the sea surface. The escort aircraft also hover uncertainly above.</p>
<p>In the wheelhouse of the destroyer, a person with a headset on his head issues simple orders. The captain says a word into the telephone and issues a signal again. Two sharp explosions sound behind. On both sides of the destroyer, a depth charge flies out. In an instant, the seawater leaps, like when a spoon hits a puree and the juice splashes. The remaining destroyers also turn their heads like water snakes and head straight for the place where the bomb exploded. At that time, it seems that the entire sea is boiling.</p>
<p>Perhaps nothing is gained, and this hunt ends. Or a cigar-shaped object emerges from the water, and the sound of artillery is followed by the explosion of depth charges. Or a few frightened and desperate crew members escape death and are lucky enough to be rescued. That night, the London Admiralty issued a communiqué stating that an enemy submarine had been destroyed.</p>
<p>But in the London Shipping Department, there are also officials with gloomy faces who are crossing out ship names on the ship list. In the Aircraft Manufacturing Department and the Army and Navy Departments, the lights are bright, and they are busy readjusting their plans due to the loss of aircraft, artillery, or raw materials.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the driver comfortably leans on his seat, the pilot manipulates the instruments, the bomber looks at the sight, and the lights on the airfield behind the fuselage gradually dim and finally disappear. The target of this aircraft is a port used by German submarines as a nest. After an hour of night flight, it has reached the airspace over the French coast, advancing towards Lorit at high altitude. A line of light is seen in the distance, and the pilot happily exhales. The driver knows that this light is the fire set by his companion an hour ago, and flies quickly towards the fire.</p>
<p>The aircraft soars over German Le Leidenni. The nose of the aircraft stops above the fire, and at this time, the fire has gradually increased, not just a line of light. The flames are also clearly visible, and there are many black shadows.</p>
<p>The driver nods and pulls the control stick forward. The fuselage begins to dive, and the anti-aircraft fire below fires at the same time. Shells explode into balls of sparks around the top, bottom, left, and right of the aircraft, and the fuselage shakes violently. Searchlight beams sweep across the sky. The driver finds the target, and then tilts, turns, and slides down lower.</p>
<p>The bombardier lies on the nose of the aircraft, one eye watching through the sight, and constantly shouting into the microphone, "To the left, to the right, a little to the left, a little more to the right, forward, forward, to the front" and other slogans.</p>
<p>He suddenly presses the button, and the bombs fall one by one, and the fuselage jumps up at the same time. The signal pole falls on the dock, and the explosions continue one after another, and the sparks rush straight into the sky.</p>
<p>The control stick is pulled back, and the fuselage rises straight up. When it reaches a high altitude, it turns its head down again and repeats the same process as before. Finally, it rises above the range of searchlights and anti-aircraft guns, and turns its head back to the camp. Behind, a raging fire is seen, illuminating the sky. On the way back to camp, it may meet an aircraft performing the same mission. The report of the bombing of the base used by German submarines to attack the Atlantic route is also passed on one after another at the Bombing Command in the morning.</p>
<p>German soldiers and conscripted Frenchmen put out the fire all night, and the next morning, they rush between the damaged houses and the port. The tilted ships are towed into the dock. The water gates and dock doors need to be repaired. When the fire is raging and the demolition team is clearing the ruins, the sound of the rolling machine may fill the air again.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the surface of the Thames Estuary is illuminated by the moonlight, turning into a silver color. The seaport several miles away is waiting quietly in the dark. A German aircraft is advancing towards the estuary in the distance, and the buzzing sound of the aircraft is heard in the air, gradually increasing. After a while, the fuselage descends, and the bomb doors are opened. Under the moonlight, a magnetic mine falls down. The parachute on the mine opens automatically, so that the mine falls gently on the sea surface, so that it does not explode before touching the seabed. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Continental Daily News commented that recently, various postures expressed by the United States have made the Tokyo Electric Department believe that the United States has an intention of appeasing Japan, because President Nasford did not specifically mention Japan in his famous fireside chat. Various parties have also expressed that the United States does not seem to have any need to be hostile to Japan. For example, the New York Daily News published an editorial, requesting that the United States adopt a realistic attitude towards Japan in order to avoid the United States fighting Germany and Japan at the same time. Therefore, Japanese newspapers are discussing it, and they are taking a tough stance towards the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Domei News Agency issued a message from Saigon, saying that the British expatriates there had received secret orders to prepare to evacuate, and made mysterious allusions to the Far East crisis.</p>
<p>American Policy Will Never Change</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers and politicians are complacent about these unimportant postures of the United States, and regard them as a sign that the United States is making concessions. The Japanese often make neurotic speculations about any action by the United States, but Chinese friends must not worry about this. The United States will never sell China to appease Japan. The Japanese seem to have ignored this point when they are elated. The Washington State Department has solemnly denied that the policy of the United States has undergone any changes. President Luo's famous remarks are indeed unsatisfactory, but today is the time for action, and empty words are useless in reality.</p>
<p>Urgent Need to Take Practical Action</p>
<p>The United States must make its own decisions and stop the threat posed by Japan in the Pacific region with swift steps. Japan is the weakest member of the Axis powers. Before the United States fights Germany, it should first deal with Japan. The United States should act decisively and resolve Japan first, so as to avoid future worries when fighting against Nazi aggressors. It must be known that there is no use in compromising with the Japanese to maintain peace in the Pacific. The result will be no benefit. Only by taking practical action can we win the awareness and respect of Tokyo. Therefore, we must advocate practical action, so that justice and goodwill can be seen in the Pacific region. rule.</p>

<p>Reverend George H.High, a pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church, who has resided in China for 41 years, has already boarded the Anqing ship to Xiamen, and will then return to the United States to treat his eye ailment and for rest. During his time in China, Reverend High traveled to various places and shot thirty-four tigers. He authored the book "Blue Tiger" and collected specimens for various natural science groups, amounting to as many as 22,000 species. Among these were newly discovered pythons, fish capable of swimming upstream in waterfalls, and record-breaking big horn sheep. Reverend High was always fond of tiger hunting. In Fujian, he often hunted in the mountains with local Chinese, using the opportunity to preach the gospel of Christianity to them. According to Reverend High, the best time for tiger hunting is on cloudy days, when tigers are more likely to leave their dens. Hunters use a small lamb as bait, and when the tiger approaches, they shoot it with a .25 caliber rifle, often delivering a fatal blow with a single shot. In addition to hunting tigers in China, Reverend High also hunted black bears and wild boars in Alaska and Russia. When asked which of the animals he hunted were the most dangerous, Reverend High replied that black bears were the most dangerous, followed by wild boars, and lastly tigers. Although hunting has been Reverend High's lifelong passion, he has never neglected his missionary work in China for the past eleven years.</p>

<p>According to shipping industry sources, the Tai Koo Company's Yuezhou ship arrived in port the day before yesterday (the 3rd) and docked at the Tai Koo Wharf. It carried 5,000 bags of low-priced Xiaojiao rice from the Public Works Department. Unloading was completed yesterday afternoon. According to a senior official of the Lap Kee Foreign Firm, a total of 165,000 bags of low-priced Xiaojiao rice arrived last month. As last month was the first month that Xiaojiao rice was sold in Shanghai at a low price, the quantity of foreign rice shipped to Shanghai was also half the usual amount. In the future, the Hong Kong government will definitely be able to supply 25,000 to 120,000 tons of foreign rice per month without any interruption. As a result, the prices of various types of rice continued to fall in the rice market yesterday. Xiaojiao rice fell to 110 yuan, the same as the low-price rice. Saigon broken rice fell to 87 yuan, but there were few buyers. It is expected that with the continuous influx of foreign rice, the price of rice in Shanghai will fall drastically.</p>
<p>Twelve Rice Merchants Jointly Undertake Orders</p>
<p>The first batch of low-priced Xiaojiao rice from the Public Works Department was ordered by Lap Kee, Shek Mao Foreign Firm, Tai Run, and seventeen other grain shops. The second batch of low-priced Xiaojiao rice will be ordered by twelve firms, including Ruichangfa. Retail rice shops in Shanghai who wish to purchase more low-priced Xiaojiao rice can directly contact these twelve grain shops. Their addresses are: (1) Ruichangfa, 53 Renjili, Xinzha Road; (2) Shengxing, 467 Jiangxi Road; (3) Gongda, 85 Maigaobao Road; (4) Zhengxingxie, 163 Julai Road; (5) Tai Run, 22 Yonganfang, Yongan Street; (6) Xiemao, 79 Fada Road; (7) Yuxing, 49 Taiheli, Baierbu Road; (8) Daheng, 1 Liheli, Beile Road; (9) Yifengjin, 110 Laoshenfu Road; (10) Hengfengtai, 20 Yulong Street; (11) Zhenxing, 29 Tianzhutang Street; (12) Xichangde, 208 Aiwen Road.</p>
<p>Report Insufficient Weight to the Police</p>
<p>According to a Public Works Department announcement, the department has recently received reports that certain rice shops selling the department's foreign rice are providing short weights. The matter is under investigation. The department's foreign rice is stipulated to be 80 kilograms (or 160 Shanghai catties) per shi (unit of dry measure), sold for 110 yuan. Citizens purchasing rice should weigh the amount received at the rice shop to verify the weight. If any short weight is discovered, please report it to the nearest police station for investigation. Furthermore, the workers involved in the strike at rice shops in the Public Concession will be released in full this morning at 9 a.m. The negotiations between the rice shop owners and labor representatives did not take place yesterday.</p>

<p>When the Shanghai war broke out, refugees from all over flocked to the concessions. Their situation was extremely miserable, and many were homeless, spending their days begging on the streets. It was even more tragic. Led by Chen Heqin, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association was organized to take in newsboy beggars, providing both relief and education, with remarkable results.</p>
<p>Three Locations for the Institute</p>
<p>The welfare institution initially rented premises at 190 Ningbo Road. Not long after, the landlord took back the property. Subsequently, through the introduction of Reverend Jiang Changchuan, they negotiated with Mr. Jiang Yuanhua, who generously lent the former St. Anna's dance hall on Zilin Road for free. However, the premises were small and the number of people was large, which was very cramped. Last winter, it merged with Huile Garden, which was run by Dr. He for the relief of destitute children.</p>
<p>Purchase of a New Site</p>
<p>Huile Garden is the property of the American Women's Missionary Society, located on Liyuan Road in the Nanshi district. The environment is secluded and covers six and a half mu of land. The open space is suitable for cultivating vegetables and raising chickens and rabbits to supplement production. Part-time work and part-time study truly make it a paradise for children. The landowner, in view of the association's relief of poor children, which is a charitable organization, voluntarily reduced the price and sold it for three thousand US dollars. After deliberation, it was decided to issue shares to solicit donations widely, hoping that benevolent gentlemen and ladies at home and abroad will uphold the principle of helping those in need and generously donate to accomplish this good deed. The "Shanghai Children's Welfare Association's Method for Soliciting Donations to Purchase Huile Garden Shares" is recorded below.</p>
<p>Share Subscription Method</p>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association's Board of Directors hereby initiates the purchase of the entire base building of Huile Garden on Liyuan Road, Nanshi: (1) The base occupies six and a half mu; (2) A three-story western-style building; (3) A two-story building; (4) A large assembly hall; (5) A row of Chinese-style bungalows. It has been resolved to issue shares, approved for 100 shares, each share worth 1,000 yuan, totaling legal tender 100,000 yuan. The property rights of Huile Garden belong to the American Women's Missionary Society and are currently leased to the association for free for six months. Now, due to the need for funds to support the schools it runs in Shanghai, it is willing to sell it to the association for three thousand US dollars, equivalent to about 57,000 yuan in legal tender at the current exchange rate.</p>
<p>Shareholder Protection After the property is purchased, it will be leased to the welfare institute for an annual rent of one yuan. In the future, if the institute ceases operations or is subject to external pressure and mismanagement, the shareholders' board of directors has the right to terminate the lease agreement and lease it to other charitable organizations or sell the property, distributing the proceeds to the shareholders, but only with the consent of more than half of the shareholders. The above method allows donors to have the right to supervise and manage the recipients, which is completely different from ordinary donations where the donor has no right to inquire after the donation is made. Therefore, each shareholder who holds shares has the right to elect and be elected as a director. Once five directors are elected, they will form a board of directors, fully supervising the work of the welfare institute and providing the institute with cooperation and convenience.</p>
<p>Payment Method For the convenience of those who donate and purchase shares, in addition to those who pay in full at once, payments can be made in several installments within one year to facilitate flexibility. The payment location is the association at Room 4, 169 Yuemingyuan Road.</p>
<p>Expert Estimate According to the estimate of building engineer Yang Kuanlin, the reported selling price of Huile Garden is extremely low. Considering only the building construction, it is worth more than this amount. Moreover, there are several acres of open space. It is known that there are many who are vying to purchase this property. The property owner, knowing that the association is a charitable organization that provides relief, voluntarily reduced the price for the association to purchase it.</p>
<p>Use of Funds The entire base building of Huile Garden is worth far more than the selling price. The association will base it on the current market value of 100,000 yuan. After paying more than 57,000 yuan to the property owner, the remainder will be used to repair the houses and for equipment and furnishings, so that the welfare institute will become a paradise for many destitute children, making it a once-and-for-all solution.</p>

<p>The Aim is to Help These People Become Self-Reliant, Gradually Reducing the Number of Beggars</p>
<p>Major Walker, commander of the Shanghai Salvation Army, stated yesterday that the army has been cooperating with the police to run a beggar shelter for the past five months, having accommodated over 1,800 beggars. In the first four months, a total of 188 beggars left the shelter. Recently, another 143 beggars were sent back to their hometowns, and 140 others who guaranteed not to beg again have also left the shelter. The Salvation Army plans to continue sending away several hundred beggars within one or two weeks. The ultimate goal of the shelter program is to enable beggars to become self-reliant, gradually reducing the number of beggars in the Public Concession, rather than permanently maintaining the lives of these vagrants.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Public Works Department Abattoir - Rental Decision <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Public Works Department abattoir, one of the department's newest properties, has been leased to the Japanese Livestock Market from June 1 for a period of one year. The Public Works Department issued a brief statement yesterday (the 3rd) afternoon, announcing that it had approved the lease of certain parts of the department's abattoir, such as the livestock pens, slaughterhouses, and cold storage rooms. The details were not announced yesterday, but well-informed sources confirmed that the Public Works Department can obtain a rent of 137,000 yuan. The inspection of various types of meat will continue to be carried out by the health department. The fees obtained by the Public Works Department for inspecting meat can reach at least 500,000 yuan per year. If all the livestock needed in the city is slaughtered there, the inspection fee can reach 750,000 yuan. Although the Public Works Department health department staff have inspected the equipment of the abattoir, the lease agreement has not yet been signed.</p>
<p>Public Works Department officials denied yesterday the rumor that the Japanese company had completely monopolized the livestock business by renting the abattoir. It is claimed that there are still two privately operated abattoirs in the two concessions, and that almost all the livestock from nearby areas is transported to Shanghai through this market. Therefore, after the market rents the department's abattoir, it can reduce the need for middlemen, and the price of meat can be reduced. What is most important, of course, is that the lease contract stipulates that all meat slaughtered in the abattoir must be subject to the Public Works Department health regulations. The Public Works Department abattoir is located on Shajing Road and is equipped with the latest facilities, capable of slaughtering 300-400 cattle, 2,000 pigs, 400-500 sheep, and over 100 calves per day. However, the number of livestock slaughtered at the abattoir in recent years has been far less than this number due to the scarcity of supply and the high price of meat, which has greatly reduced demand.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Madam Yan of Dinghai Donates Large Sum for Disaster Relief <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Sells Valuable Land Worth Tens of Thousands of Dollars</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Dinghai Relief Committee has been actively engaged in disaster relief, raising more than 100,000 yuan in donations. This money has been used to purchase rice and other grains. The relief measures vary depending on the order in which the affected villages reported the number of disaster victims.</p>
<p>Divided Relief</p>
<p>Those who reported earlier, such as the eleven villages of Maoao, Xiaosha, Dazhanmao, Xibaichan, Ganao, Xiedong, Beichan, Dongao, Jiacang, and Ziwei, were each given 50 bags of rice and 50 bags of other grains for both sale at a reduced price and free distribution. This is the first batch. Those who reported later, such as the nine villages of Dasha, Jin Yi, Jin Er, Jin San, Jinkou, Hejian, Cenmu, Dingbai, Yongdong, and Wuxie, were each given 50 bags of other grains for free distribution. This is the second batch. In total, the two batches have benefited more than 20 villages. For those villages that continue to report in the future, it is planned to provide relief according to the second batch's example, limited to the available donations. There is a fellow villager from the county living abroad, Madam Yan, who is charitable and generous. She initially donated 10,000 yuan, specifically for disaster relief in the Ganao township. Later, due to the large disaster area and the large number of disaster victims, she sent another letter to the committee, offering to sell all 26 mu of fertile land and 5 mu of reed land that she owns in Baichuan. The lowest price per mu is 1,000 yuan, with half of the proceeds to be used for disaster relief in Ganao and half for disaster relief in other counties. The committee believes that Madam Yan's compassion in helping those in need is commendable, and that her act of donating land for disaster relief will widely benefit the disaster victims. It is appropriate to fulfill her wishes and vigorously promote its success. It has been resolved to accept her offer and send a letter of thanks. The auction of the land will begin on June 25 and end. The matter of the auction is, in terms of the donation party, a matter of benevolence and helping the masses. The buyers compete to bid higher prices, so that the disaster victims can receive more benefits. Their virtue is also not insignificant. Therefore, the committee has the provision to send honorary commemorative gifts. It is hoped that the fellow villagers from Dinghai in Shanghai will actively participate in this auction. The higher the bid, the greater the merit. Once the transaction is successful, one will obtain good property and help a good cause, which is killing two birds with one stone. Please pay attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The labor dispute between the Commercial Press and its employees has been ongoing for over a month without resolution. Previously, the management entrusted lawyer Wang Yaotang to issue severance pay, but the labor representatives refused to accept the money because they did not agree to the terms. Yesterday, the management published an advertisement to withdraw the payment location and separately notified each employee whose contract was not being renewed. In addition to requesting the Public Works Department Industrial Section to issue the second half of May's salary immediately, the representatives also hoped to start negotiations quickly and seek a resolution that is in line with their principles. Yesterday, both sides decided to meet with lawyer Wang Yaotang. Lawyer Wang stated that when the client entrusted him, they said that the labor and management sides had already reached a settlement with the Public Works Department Industrial Section. He was only entrusted with the payment procedures. He did not expect the matter to deteriorate so badly. The representatives said that since lawyer Wang was entrusted by the management, we can only ask lawyer Wang to be responsible and request that the employees whose contracts are not being renewed not be notified before labor and management reach an agreement. Lawyer Wang said that he would accept this and could inquire with the management about the solution. He will have a response this morning (the 5th) at 9 a.m.</p>

<p>The price of coal balls has been raised privately, causing public outcry and indignation. It is understood that the concession authorities, in view of the fact that the increase in the price of coal balls is purely due to the manipulation and monopoly of large quantities of spot goods and the manipulation of the market, are now investigating the manufacturing cost of coal balls in the Valley Machine-Made Coal Ball Factory. They will notify the Shanghai Municipal Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association to try to re-determine the standard selling price, so as to ease the burden on the common people and maintain social order.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Remittance Premium Disappears <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>In order to adjust the funds of the industry and meet the needs of industry and commerce, the Shanghai Silver Money Industry Association has been handling inter-industry remittances since July 1, 1939. After the remittances are used, the preparation is concentrated to facilitate circulation. A committee is formed to check the remittance preparations on a daily basis to show great credit. This remittance bill is deeply trusted by the certificate holders. Chinese and foreign banks and foreign firms are happy to accept and use it. At present, the remittance bill has the same effect as the check and cash. The past remittance premium has gradually decreased from a rate of 180 yuan per thousand yuan to between 50 cents and 1 yuan. Recently, the premium has disappeared invisibly. The remittance and the cash check are adjusted at the same price, and there is no need for a premium. This is really a good phenomenon in Shanghai's finance. It is because Chinese and foreign merchants have a considerable understanding of the new remittance code with a solid guarantee. The circulation volume of the new remittance was 29,999,900 yuan in national currency as of April 30 this year, and the total value of the collateral paid by each bank and village was 46,677,893 yuan, 3 corners and 9 cents in national currency, and was publicly inspected by the Inter-Industry Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee to verify that it complied with the regulations.</p>

<p>The Soviet expatriate group in Shanghai held a meeting at the Soviet Overseas Chinese Federation on Sunday (the 1st) and passed a plan to build a new guildhall, including a theater and a school. It is said that the construction cost is estimated at US$100,000, and bonds will be issued at US$10 per bond. All Russian permits can be purchased. According to the authorities of the Soviet Overseas Chinese Federation, this move is purely commercial in nature and not a charitable undertaking. The bonds bear an annual interest rate of 4%, and the guildhall's real estate is used as collateral. It is understood that the first step will be to build a theater, and then build the general association hall and school. The facilities and curriculum of the school will be based on the current school system in the Soviet Union and will be directly managed by the Soviet government. Although the address of the new guildhall has not yet been determined, it is generally believed that it will be on the open space at the corner of Xiafei Road and Shanzhong Road.</p>

<p>Jin Huating, 36 years old, a native of Shaoxing, the manager of the British-owned Shanghai Copper Manufacturing Co., Ltd. at 162 Guangdong Road, lived in the manufacturing plant of the company at 1200 Hede Road. At 12:40 noon yesterday, three kidnappers arrived at the factory in a car with a forged military pass number 359. The three kidnappers entered the factory, tied up Jin, and forced him into the car, which sped off to the west.</p>
<p>Detain Gemen</p>
<p>When the car drove to the vicinity of the Tietoukou near the Sakura Lane on Laobosen Road, the police officers stationed there stopped them for routine inspection. The police officers went forward to search them. Unexpectedly, the kidnappers, knowing that things were not going well, took the initiative and opened fire on the police officers. The police officers dispersed and returned fire. For a while, there was a great burst of gunfire. The kidnappers were no match and abandoned the hostage and fled. They soon disappeared. At this time, the police station had received the news and sent a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to encircle and arrest them.</p>
<p>Rescued Hostage</p>
<p>The hostage Jin Huating was escorted home. When the shooting occurred, police officers number 1063, 132, and 901 of the Third Hua Company were injured by the kidnappers' bullets. At the same time, one of the three kidnappers also had his face injured by a bullet fired by the police, but the kidnapper still managed to escape. Afterwards, the police station drove the kidnappers' car back to the police station for detention. It was also heard that when the kidnappers kidnapped Jin, they secretly followed Jin's relative, Lu, into the factory. After Jin was kidnapped, Lu's whereabouts became unknown. Therefore, the police station has strong suspicions about Lu and is currently investigating.</p>

<p>At 6:15 yesterday morning, two men and one woman suddenly came to Yitai Taxi Company on Fuzhou Road and hired a taxi. The taxi company dispatched car number 17719, driven by driver Tao Ying, to serve them. After the three passengers got into the car, they told him to drive to Hongqiao Road in the western suburbs of Shanghai. When they arrived there, two more men got in and told Tao to drive to Caobao Road. When they reached Bridge No. 3 on that road, it became clear that the male and female passengers in the car were gangsters.</p>
<p>The men and women in the car were gangsters</p>
<p>Two of the gangsters suddenly pulled out handguns, forced Tao out of the car, and tied him up with ropes, abandoning him by the roadside. The car was then driven away by the gangsters. At about 9 a.m., Tao was discovered tied up by passers-by, who reported it to the local security team. They rescued Tao and went to the Caohejing Corps. Unexpectedly, Tao spotted two gangsters walking on the road and went forward to arrest them.</p>

<p>Since the increase in prices of goods in Shanghai, many vagrants roam the streets. Some, with no means of livelihood, resort to snatching food from others to fill their stomachs. This kind of phenomenon has been common. Unexpectedly, yesterday, a tragedy occurred. Yesterday morning at 9:45 AM, a child named Xie Pengfei (seven years old), a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 75 Xiangshun Lane, Rue Belier, French Concession, bought a cake from a cake stall across the street. Unexpectedly, a vagrant saw that he was young and immediately stepped forward to snatch his cake, fleeing wildly to the opposite sidewalk. The child, because his food was taken, immediately ran after him. While running onto the street, a trolleybus No. 175 of the French merchant, traveling from east to west, could not brake in time and knocked the child down in front of No. 110, across from the Jianshe Bookstore. Instantly, his brains splattered, and he died tragically under the wheels. Subsequently, the police arrived and dragged the child's body from under the wheels, sending the vehicle to the coroner's office, reporting for examination. It was truly tragic.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: HSBC's listed prices for all currencies were flat. The black market exchange rate for British and American currencies was flat. The US dollar initially eased and then rebounded slightly. After the market opened in the morning, a small amount of selling came from Hong Kong Electric, and Chinese speculators followed up with aggressive selling, causing the US dollar to rise from 5.34375 yuan to 5.40625 yuan around 10 o'clock, making it difficult to sell and settle. Because of the appetite of Mai Jia Li, the market, which was about to stop easing, was injected with another 100,000 US dollars from Hong Kong Electric, so it rebounded slightly to 5.375 yuan, up 0.03125 yuan. The British pound was flat at 3 shillings, 296875 yuan. Trading was thin in the first half of the day, and the market was closed on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a dull black market performance, continuing to be lackluster. Because the US dollar was in a speculative selling trend, the bullish camp was shaken. New bullish parties, including Tong Kang Yong and Guangbang Heng, and the ticket merchants Dafeng and Xinfeng Yong (re-emerged), followed suit, and market sentiment was weak. The price fell from 6,450 yuan at the morning opening to 6,426 yuan around 10 o'clock. However, the US dollar eased slightly, and Xinfeng Yong, together with the securities group Defu, and retail short-sellers scrambled to cover, and the market rebounded slightly, ultimately up 23 yuan. Total trading volume in the first half of the day was 20,000 taels. The market was closed on Wednesday afternoon, and there was no off-market trading. Spot transactions were rare, and prices were weak. Wanfeng offered 10 taels of Zhongxing gold, with a price 300 yuan higher than the term price, later 290 yuan higher with no buyers.

<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market initially fell and then rose, remaining in consolidation. At the early market opening, due to the continued distribution of Hong Kong-Vietnam par-priced public sale rice, local households were quite sluggish in market transactions, and hoarders continued to release their holdings, causing spot and futures rice prices to continue downward. Subsequently, because Siamese rice telegrams were not transferred, major players attempted to maintain their positions, and domestic dealers and retail investors actively absorbed supply at lower prices, and the market slowly rose. No. 1 Saigon was sold at the lowest price of 116 yuan, No. 2 at 112 yuan, No. 2 at 107 yuan, Min Dang at 112-113 yuan, and Xiao Wen at 110 yuan, 109.5 yuan, a significant drop of 4-5 yuan compared to before. This prompted rural customers to take advantage of the cheap prices, and floating hoarders and retail investors also absorbed supply, and actual sales followed, and the situation gradually became active. Chinese speculators continued to sell at the same price, so it soon became difficult to sell and settle. HSBC's listed exchange rates remained unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was still levied at 2.25%. After 2.25%, speculators aggressively sold July US dollars at 5.40625 yuan, and the market hardened to settlement. Soon, Mai Jia Li absorbed 100,000 US dollars of July futures at 5.40625 yuan, and the intention to speculate short weakened. Suddenly, a telegram from Hong Kong reported that July futures were being sold at 5.375 yuan, and the market eased. At noon closing, spot prices and July futures were quoted at a British exchange rate of 3 shillings 296875 yuan and a US dollar exchange rate of 5.375 yuan, with British exchange rates flat and US dollar exchange rates down 0.03125 compared to the previous day's closing.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Had No Gains or Losses</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 4th (Wednesday) telegram, the exchange market opened flat this morning, with no gains or losses for all currencies. The market was closed on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Continued to Rise</p>
<p>Tianjin, 4th (Wednesday) telegram, the exchange market opened firm this morning, with London telegraphic transfers rising by 1.40625 to 3 pence 84375, and New York telegraphic transfers easing by 0.02875 to 6.25 yuan. Shanghai exchange rates fell by 2 yuan to 87 yuan. "Joint notes" on the black market were cheaper by 1.75 yuan to 65 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Fresh Japanese Notes Still Being Pushed Up <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions: black market prices were slightly weak, with British and American gold pounds also down by one yuan each. British gold tickets also tended to be dull, and market prices were stable.</p>
<p>Since the morning, the opening price per bar (ten taels) was 6,450 yuan, 9 yuan lower than the late closing price of the previous day. It was heard that US dollars could be settled at 5.375 yuan. Heng Ji, Cheng Ji, Shi He, De Cheng, Tong Kang Yong, and Da Feng all came to aggressively sell, and retail investors pressed sales, and Xinfeng Yong stopped buying and started selling, and the price gradually dropped by 24 yuan to 6,425 yuan. As Xinfeng Yong strongly entered the market again, Defu also bought, and July US dollars at 5.40625 yuan were difficult to settle, and the easing suddenly rebounded, and market sentiment strengthened, and retail short positions scrambled to cover, and the market was immediately pushed up to 6,444 yuan. However, Tong Kang Yong continued to sell, and the price fluctuated between 6,435-6 yuan and 6,442 yuan, with only a few yuan of fluctuation, until the noon closing price of 6,436 yuan, which was 23 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Based on the settlement price of June US dollars at 5.375 yuan, it was 6,479 yuan, down 43 yuan. After closing, each price rose by 2-3 yuan, and No. 1 Saigon returned to 118.5 yuan, No. 2 to 113-4 yuan, Min Dang to 115.5 yuan, Xiao Wen to 112-3 yuan, Huo Jiao to 115 yuan, Qie Fo rice to 114 yuan, Tokyo polished tips to 103 yuan, and broken tips to 88-9 yuan. However, after a large drop and a small rebound, market sentiment was inevitably weaker, and after a movement, it returned to sluggishness, and until the close, it often only revolved around this price, without any change, so the result was still 2 yuan lower than the previous closing price. Yinghua Si's return to the original sentence Saigon No. 1 is now 136 yuan, Lu is 137 yuan, Xiao Jiao is from 135.5 yuan to 134 yuan, and Broken rice is from 102 yuan to 100 yuan, but the market again shouted higher by 1-2 yuan. 2-30,000 bags arrived throughout the day, with more than 10,000 bags sold, and 7-800 tons of original bags.</p>
<p>The situation of thick and thin japonica and domestic rice is completely different. Early and late rice are more active, while thick japonica is unusually quiet. This is because with the arrival of summer, consumers are not solely seeking rice quality, but are looking for fresh new products, and old goods are not welcomed. However, most of the thick japonica that has arrived is old, while early and late rice are the opposite. Most of the rice arriving in Shanghai is fragrant and fresh, so stores choose to purchase it to meet customer demand. Therefore, the thick japonica market is difficult to compete with early and late rice, and it is often inferior. Yesterday, because foreign rice continued to weaken, domestic rice was inevitably constrained. Although early and late rice depreciated, it was limited, with fresh special-grade goods from South China still requiring 137 yuan, and ordinary goods falling from 135 yuan to 132 yuan. Thick japonica saw a drop of more than 2 yuan, with Kunshan white japonica selling for 132 yuan, falling to 127-8 yuan, and no original bags were traded.</p>
<p>Sales of glutinous rice remain poor. In addition, with other goods uniformly weakening, the market is difficult to support, and prices have successively fallen by 2-3 yuan. Hong Kong white is priced at 112 yuan, 110 yuan, and high-grade glutinous tea is priced at 104 yuan, falling to 100 yuan. High-grade domestic yuan is priced at 120 yuan, falling to 116 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e78">FLOUR AND WHEAT BUSINESS QUIET <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The spot market for foreign flour only saw slight transactions for Golden Dragon brand and Fortress brand flour. Fortress brand flour opened at 29.6 yuan, and Golden Dragon flour opened at 28.7-5 yuan. Zhonglou flour from foreign warehouses was priced at 29.6-7 yuan. Less than 10,000 bags were traded, down about half a yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>Wheat transactions: Because new wheat will soon be on the market, the market price is around 60 yuan per dan (old standard), and with transportation and miscellaneous expenses added, the total price is similar to that of old wheat in the Shanghai market, so factories are not eager to prepare for purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e79">MISCELLANEOUS GRAINS: CORN AND BEAN CAKE SPECULATION UNPROFITABLE <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the corn and bean cake market conditions: because actual sales are sluggish and speculation is unprofitable for bulls, the market is declining and difficult to reverse in the short term. Yesterday, corn continued to fall by more than 2 yuan, with more than 2,000 bags traded. The opening price of old Saigon corn was 23 yuan to 22 yuan, the price of new corn was 25.5 yuan to 24.5 yuan, the price of Dutch white corn was 25.2 yuan to 24.5 yuan, and the price of yellow corn was 27 yuan to 26.8 yuan. Shengji Cake World made more than 30,000 pieces of bean cake, with spot prices at 17.5 yuan, June upper May lower warehouse orders from 18.8 yuan to 18.1 yuan, and the closing price rebounded to 18.5 yuan and a half. June lower June upper warehouse orders from 19.5 yuan to 19 yuan, and the closing price rebounded to 19.3 yuan and a half.</p>

<p>The black market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday. Major bullish players added to their positions, while old bullish players sold off, but there was still unmet demand, and market sentiment was still very good. Yesterday morning, Yuxing and Hongda aggressively bought Huai bonds, and Xie Kang and Runde also purchased actively. Xinhua, Sheng Da Ren, Shuang Jiu Feng and other firms supplied bonds. Market prices were slightly firmer for C bonds, and there was no difference for the rest. In the afternoon, Yu and Hongda increased their purchasing power, with the two firms purchasing more than 600,000 yuan. Hengfu and Xinfu also purchased more than 100,000 yuan each. Tongkang bullish players took advantage of the high prices to sell off, totaling more than 500,000 yuan. C bonds were slightly pressured in the afternoon, so they sought a bull color. Yizhong and Lianhe also sold a significant amount. E bonds reached 7 yuan again, and B bonds reached the 70 yuan mark. Excluding D bonds, which were priced too high in the previous two days, all others rose by one to two and a half points. Transactions totaled around 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Transactions for 50 shares of Sincere Company, priced at 10.025 yuan.</p>
<p>The British firm Lee Brothers Motors Limited will pay an interim dividend on June 13, at 2 yuan per share in national currency.</p>
<p>The British firm Union Wharf Limited will pay an interim dividend of one yuan per share in national currency on June 30 for the one-year period ending September 30 of this year.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Tuesday) telegram, today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks were flat, with no changes in prices.</p>
<p>The stock market in general was in a dull situation, and transactions were still not expanding. Many who were searching for goods were inclined to sell off and settle, and most of the market prices fell. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e81">YARN AND COTTON: MAJOR DOUBLE HORSE PLAYERS OFFER SUPPLY, MARKET IS SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY FUTURES PRICES <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, but the actual situation has shown significant progress. Purchasing from Hong Kong has improved, with around 1,200 bales of coarse and fine yarns being bought, so some people are optimistic, and the market has rebounded after falling. However, some players came to sell off, and market sentiment was affected. Judging from the overall trend, it is still not outside the consolidation range. The high price for 20-count Double Horse was 1,434 yuan, and the low price was 1,417 yuan. The initial trading in the afternoon was 1,429 yuan to 1,430 yuan, falling to 1,426 yuan. The final price was 1,428 yuan. The market price in the afternoon was unusually scattered, with very few transactions. Today, 1,515 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, and the market was average. Because major players offered some supply, the market was relatively loose. The initial price was 1,428 yuan. At this time, sellers were numerous. Then it was heard that the opening price for July futures was 1,370 yuan, falling to 1,364.5 yuan at the close, and market sentiment became more weak, and selling pressure increased, and the price fell to 1,417 yuan. However, as prices fell, bullish players re-entered and prices rebounded, and at the same time, the closing price for July futures was 1,375 yuan, and market sentiment revived, rising to 1,434 yuan. After fluctuating around this 30 yuan mark for a long time, the closing price was 1,429 yuan. According to the daily transaction statistics, 9,255 bales were traded. The amount purchased by each firm is listed below: Hong Kong: 1,240; Domestic: 115; Peers: 8,000; Total: 9,255.</p>
<h3 id="e82">COTTON MARKET TURNAROUND, TRANSACTIONS ALSO IN COARSE COTTON <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is as calm as ever. Because the market for good foreign cotton continues to rise, although transactions are mediocre, market sentiment is consistently good. However, business in raw materials for coarse yarn is quite good.</p>
<p>Plains Cotton 196 Hongzhang 5.0 pieces sent to the factory</p>
<p>Middling 424 No. 100 pieces delivered to the warehouse</p>
<p>Another 426.75 Another 100 pieces</p>
<p>Fireweed 185 Another 100 bags</p>
<p>Another 1.5 Another 100 bags</p>
<p>Another report: Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai banks, after several days of silence, the cotton market had a slight turnaround yesterday. Factories and peers were both willing to purchase, and were particularly interested in raw materials for fine cotton, so the market was still relatively active. Brazilian cotton for 32-count raw materials was generally priced around 131.30 yuan.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was active and firm, because the cotton cloth trade was good, and Wall Street strongly rose. As a result, the closing price rose by 13-1.4 pounds.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to bullish players taking profits, but subsequently rebounded due to combined support from buyers and continuous hedging. Yesterday's closing prices rose by half a rupee to three rupees. It is also predicted that the market will open higher today due to the strong rise in New York, expecting to rise by 11 rupees.</p>
<p>Also, from September 1 of last year to May 31 of this year, Indian cotton statistics are recorded below (per bale of 400 pounds):</p>
<p>Bombay: 2,666,000 bales were listed.</p>
<p>1,517,000 bales remain.</p>
<p>Karachi: 1,156,000 bales were listed.</p>

<h3 id="e85">MISCELLANEOUS: POPULAR STRAW HATS <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The straw hat selling season has arrived. Currently, Panama hats are the most expensive among straw hats, with selling prices ranging from 50 yuan to 100 yuan per hat. The price difference for these goods can be as high as 10 yuan or more for slight differences in thickness and fineness, so buyers must use their own judgment to avoid being fooled by the shop assistants' rhetoric.</p>
<p>Rainproof hats are one of the most popular types in recent years. The fabric comes from Japan, and some are made of paper cloth, which is of poorer quality. The method is to cut them into hat crowns, and the edges of the hat are arched by hand to form the top of the hat, and then sewn together. Both are sprayed with paint on the outside. The paint is waterproof, so it will not change its appearance when exposed to rain, so it is beautifully named a rainproof hat. However, when exposed to the sun, the poor quality ones are prone to cracking. However, because their selling price is still cheap, many people use them. The method of preservation is to wipe off the dirt with a towel cloth when it gets dirty, and avoid pressure, or it can be worn for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Triangular straw hats and brain-line hats are worn less and less due to the large-scale dumping of rainproof hats. Their selling prices are very cheap, usually only around two yuan is enough.</p>
<p>Taiwan hats are brown in color, and the quality is similar to that of Panama hats, but the selling price is much cheaper, so many people wear them. (Mei)</p>
<h3 id="e86">LONGEVITY FRUIT (2) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuyong</p>
<p>Peanuts are also called Longevity Fruit. The Ganzhou Zhi says, "Ground peanuts" are also called Longevity Fruit, taking the meaning of long vines symbolizing longevity. The English names are Mandubi, Groundnut, Peanut, or Monkeynut, most of which are named after their characteristics. The scientific name is Arachis Hypogeae, and the last word means underground, similar to what we call "ground beans" and "ground fruit." The unique fruiting state of peanuts is very eye-catching. In the West, Bentham's "Flora Brasiliensis" was the first to record it. Li Tiaoyuan's "Notes from South Vietnam" said, "Flowers cannot become vegetables, but pods are separately born between roots and stems. Dig the sand to get them. The shells are about an inch long, wrinkled and twisted; there are three or four seeds inside; like broad beans... The fruits of all plants are formed from flowers; only this one is unique, flowers from flowers, pods from pods, flowers do not produce pods, and pods do not carry flowers, which is also very strange!" In fact, the only difference from other flowers is that the flower stalks elongate and the ovaries develop underground. Yucun's record is exaggerated.</p>
<p>Some people think that the origin of peanuts is Africa, and some people think it is South America. The debate has lasted for a hundred years, and there is still no conclusion. However, most scholars believe in the South American theory. In the eighteenth century, Linnaeus thought it came from Surinam, Brazil, and Peru, but did not say whether it was wild. In 1818, R. Brown's "Flora of the Congo" thought it might have been introduced to India, Ceylon, and Malaya from China, but in all respects, the above-mentioned places do not seem to be the place of origin. Brazil has the earliest records of peanuts, so it is not accurate to say that they came from Africa to South America. Sprengel said that Theopreastus recorded the cultivation of peanuts in Egypt, but he did not know if it was the peanuts we know today. If Egypt really had them today, Forskalls and Deliles would have included them in their catalogs, which seems unreliable. Brown's theory that it was introduced from China to South America and then to Africa cannot be confirmed either.</p>
<p>DeCandolle studied from a linguistic and textual research perspective and believed that it originated in South America. He said: Marcgraff and Piso recorded and painted a common Brazilian plant named Mandubi, which seems to be the place of origin. He also quoted Monardes as saying that it is called Anchic in Peru, and Acosta recorded that it is called Mani in South America. De Candolle said that if peanuts were known to the Egyptians or Arabs early on, the theory that they originated in Africa would also be credible. But Greek, Latin, Arab scholars, and even Forskall, did not record it, so it can be known that the origin was not early. There is also nothing to prove that it originated in Asia. Thurnberg's "Flora Japonica" and Forster's records of the Pacific Islands are all missing. Bretchneider said that there is no peanut name in ancient Chinese books, and even the Compendium of Materia Medica in the sixteenth century does not have it. On the contrary, someone found six species of the same genus in Brazil, and someone found peanut seeds in an ancient tomb of the Ancon Peruvian people, which is enough to provide evidence for the theory that it originated in South America. As for where the wild species of peanuts that are now widely cultivated are, it is questionable. Due to the unique "self-planting" nature of peanuts, if the wild species have been destroyed, it is impossible to have them. Some people say that some in the West Indies have escaped cultivation and returned to the wild. According to DeCandolle's opinion, it was brought to Guinea by slaves in the fifteenth century, and to southern Asia by the Portuguese, so there is a way to get that prosperity.</p>
<p>Or, peanuts were first discovered in Santo Domingo in the West Indies. (During the North American Civil War) the peanut region of Virginia was occupied by the army. After peace, the army brought peanut seeds back as souvenirs, and their propagation spread. Then they were introduced to South America, 香山 to the Mundulas of India, Calcutta, and all the way to Sumatra. The last countries in Europe to cultivate them were Italy and Spain. It is said that their use was first discovered by伯特 (M. Jaubert), a侨民 from得角 (Cape Verd)加里 (Goree). Peanuts were probably imported into our country from the Ming calendar, during the period from 1576 to 1619 AD. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Men's Game - University Wins Against Alumni</p>
<p>Guanghua University held an anniversary basketball performance at the YMCA Gymnasium on 八仙橋 at 7 pm last night (3rd). In the first game, the women's teams 綠萍 and Shanghai Star played a wonderful and tense game. 綠萍 章寳 opened the scoring. At the end of the first half, Shanghai Star led by twenty to eighteen. After the break, 綠萍 launched a major counterattack. 張嘉佩 and 袁榮津 showed their skills. At the end of the third quarter, 綠萍 led Shanghai Star by five points with twenty-nine to twenty-four. In the final quarter, 綠萍 韋寳 injured her foot and left the court. Shanghai Star took the opportunity to score seven points in one go. 綠萍 had no chance to fight back. Shanghai Star narrowly defeated 綠萍 with thirty-one to twenty-nine, a difference of one point. At 8 o'clock, the men's teams took the court. The Guanghua University team played against the alumni team. Although the latter had many veterans, their physical strength was inferior to that of the student army, so they could do whatever they wanted. The first half was twenty-seven to seven. In conclusion, the university won against the alumni with fifty-three to thirty-two. The results of the two games are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Opposite Attitudes <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>A basic principle of modern children's education is to guide and encourage, rather than to force and suppress. Those responsible for educating children should avoid saying "don't do this and that" and "don't do it this way or that way." It is clever to use more rewarding and praising tones.</p>
<p>The difference between totalitarian countries and democratic countries in their attitude towards the masses today also lies here. The totalitarian government hopes that the masses will cover their ears and close their eyes, only listen to the words of the government spokesperson, not listen to foreign radio broadcasts, not read foreign newspapers and magazines, only allow praise and virtue, and not allow a word of complaint. Democratic countries are not like this. The masses have the freedom of speech, publication, reading books, reading newspapers, and listening to radio broadcasts. In the United States, "reactionaries" like Lindbergh and Wheeler, who are isolationists, are still able to speak publicly. If they were born in a totalitarian country, they would have been sent to a concentration camp long ago if they had not been "beheaded."</p>
<p>The US government's advice to Lindbergh did not exert any pressure, which shows the broad-minded and democratic spirit of a father and brother. From the psychological and educational point of view, this attitude is more correct.</p>
<p>These two opposite attitudes show the spiritual difference between totalitarian countries and democratic countries.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Myriad Gold Family Letter <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhongna</p>
<p>My son's mother:</p>
<p>Yesterday, a villager brought a letter saying that you had safely arrived home. It is said that your mother is very happy. When she married you off, you were alone, but when you came back, you were dragging two puppies. I hope that my kind mother-in-law is still as happy when she is in the kitchen. Then I will thank God.</p>
<p>Last Sunday, your middle school friends, 徽 and 她們, came to see you. I said that you had returned to your hometown to take care of the children. They stared at me and sighed, "愛麗 has finally been driven into the kitchen." It's as if I am Hitler. In fact, it doesn't matter, isn't there a big shot in our government who also advocates this? Later, they forced me to tell them the reason for your return to your hometown. I told them that because you had too many absences due to your production, you had smashed the sacred chalk rice bowl of this elementary school teacher. With a monthly income of 25 yuan less, our happy little family could not support it, so you had to return to your mother's house. They listened and left sadly, and 徽's eyes were a little wet! Do you think it's funny or not?</p>
<p>Oh, I forgot to tell you one important thing, which is indeed a major event for me. God was merciful, and I don't know how the Ministry of Education issued 140 yuan of relief money, and I received 75 yuan. I am really ashamed and unworthy of it. The 60 yuan debt you owed during production has been paid off, and I plan to put the remaining 15 yuan in the bank as the children's education expenses in the future. Do you agree?</p>
<p>You said when you left that if things don't go well after you return to your hometown, you plan to give the newborn baby to someone else and become a wet nurse yourself. At first, I strongly opposed it, thinking that it would damage our identity; but when I calmed down and thought about it, it didn't matter. Moreover, the spirit of "love my young and extend it to the young of others" is worthy of praise. So I now agree 100%.</p>
<p>Recently, my liver fire has been very strong. Yesterday, I scolded a student during class. He simply blocked me and said, "What are you so arrogant about? My family's driver is much stronger than you!" His reasons were sufficient, and I calmed down for the sake of 7 jiao per hour. I smiled, and they laughed too, so I wrote things like ×＋YXO on the blackboard again, but my hands were a little trembling. You think my progress in forbearance will definitely make you happy, won't it?</p>
<p>How is 阿大? When I see the little brats on the road, I think of him. I accumulate the picture cards of cigarettes one by one, preparing them as teaching materials for him to learn to read pictures. You see, I have fulfilled my duty as a father.</p>
<p>You said that you eat more porridge for three meals a day now. I think porridge is easy to digest and very hygienic. When I see you again, you will probably be fatter.</p>
<p>I wish you happiness always!</p>
<p>Your husband.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Plainclothes Police <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Huan Jun</p>
<p>Since the police and detectives have significant differences in their duties, plainclothes police cannot be said to be detectives. In various parts of the United States, it is rare to see police officers in uniforms on the streets except for those directing traffic, and plainclothes police officers are responsible for patrolling the streets. Although these police officers do not wear uniforms, they all carry essential items such as pistols and police whistles. When passers-by have disputes or fights, they step forward to perform their duties, show their certificates (each certificate has a photo of the police officer and is numbered), and mediate the matter. If the parties refuse to obey, they will take both parties to the nearest police station for fair handling.</p>
<p>In terms of convenience and efficiency in handling affairs, plainclothes police are indeed better than those in uniform. For example, in the case of ordinary disputes, plainclothes police first observe the progress of the situation without showing any signs of emotion and listen to the main points of the dispute between the two parties, so that they can obtain more accurate confessions in advance; if a major crime such as robbery or murder is taking place on the street, then plainclothes police can arrest the criminal unexpectedly. The thief is often easily captured because he is not prepared. Therefore, after repeated discussions by the US authorities, they unanimously believe that the implementation of plainclothes police is of great benefit to society and is worthy of promotion.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Radium Pills Take Refuge <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Shen</p>
<p>During the London air raids, ensuring the safety of radium pills became the most important issue in the medical community. There were only 18 centimeters of radium pills in the entire United Kingdom, 80% of which were stored in five large hospitals in London. If these rare drugs were unfortunately hit by bombs and destroyed, not only would huge sums of money be turned into nothing, but also thousands of cancer patients would be in an incurable situation. There is also a more dangerous thing, that is, when the radium pills are bombed, they will not turn into ashes; any violent destructive force cannot destroy them. Even if the radium pills are bombed into a cloud of dust, each grain of ash is still a complete radium pill. If this kind of dust is full of air or mixed into public water sources, it can cause terrible harm to the people of the whole city or the whole area. The radioactivity of radium is extremely great, even if it is extremely small, it can wreak havoc in the human body. When radium enters the human body, it quickly accumulates on the bones of the whole body through the spread of blood and tears. From then on, the whole body is like being buried with countless bombs. Every radium atom is a bomb, and it is constantly exploding, exploding... Anyone can easily imagine the most terrible result.</p>
<p>Because of this, every hospital in London that stores radium pills must be careful to build a particularly strong cellar for it, and install very safe and convenient lifting machinery, so that it can be quickly returned to its original place when the alarm suddenly sounds. The volume of radium pills is very small, but it must be sealed in heavy, very thick lead boxes for preservation, because the penetrating power of radium rays is very strong. If it is not blocked by thick metal, there is a danger of leakage and burns to the skin.</p>
<p>The radioactivity of radium is so great that it consumes half of the original amount every 1,700 years. After 35,000 years, it will almost completely turn into lead. Radon is a gas emitted by radium, and its radioactivity is comparable to that of radium. Therefore, hospitals usually collect this gas, seal it in small tubes, and place it deep inside cancer or tumors to replace radium pills for treatment. Radon is much shorter-lived, with only three days and nineteen hours of effective time.</p>
<p>Until recently, all the radium in the world was only two pounds (900 cm), worth 18 million US dollars.</p>

<p>— Yang Zi</p>
<p>There are two kinds of unfortunate people in the world: one is the "living dead" without inspiration. He has no desires, he has no interest in everything, he does not love his life, but he is extremely afraid of death. The other is the gluttonous "monkey." His desires are endless. He "drills around" all day long, racking his brains, trying his best to "make gimmicks" and "come up with ideas."</p>
<p>There are also two kinds of happy people in the world at the same time: one is full of vitality. He has his own hopes for struggle and immediate success. This hope is also obtained from his daily improvement and hard work. The life of the other kind of person is like a machine, slowly advancing, without disturbing or fantasizing. He can "be content." - Montesquieu.</p>

<p>(8) Perceptible Friendship</p>
<p>"Seventh Master, is there any news from the bank?" Zhao Si suddenly interrupted.</p>
<p>"This is not a problem. My friend just called and told me that they can give you the passbook tomorrow or the day after tomorrow." Then, he turned to Yu Kun and said, "It's good that you're here. Help Zhao Si with his family affairs and rush back to Tianjin together, so that he can feel at ease..."</p>
<p>Yu Kun and Zhao Si were busy answering yes.</p>
<p>"I myself have no face to write to him again." Shao Wen added.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? Seventh Master, you fell into this place for the sake of Lao San. Even a father wouldn't treat his son like this!" Yu Kun said with a smile.</p>
<p>Zhao Si was wiping the sweat on his face with a towel. Hearing Yu Kun's words, he also nodded repeatedly, expressing his agreement.</p>
<p>Shao Wen smiled slightly and deliberately changed the subject.</p>
<p>Usually, Zhao Si didn't dare to talk much when he saw Shao Wen. At this time, he was covered in sweat, even when he was sitting still, the sweat was still dripping non-stop. Therefore, he didn't say a word and let Yu Kun and Shao Wen talk continuously for dozens of minutes.</p>
<p>When leaving, Shao Wen sent them to the yard.</p>
<p>"Tell Yuqin," he said quietly to Yu Kun alone, "There is one more thing I can't do for him anymore. Persuade him to give up this idea!"</p>
<p>Yu Kun nodded slightly, knowing very well that this referred to Xiang Qi. (124)</p>

<p>Since the invention of vaccination, countless people have been saved, which can be said to be the greatest progress in medicine. Recently, some planting experts have also used this knowledge of disease prevention to inject disease-prevention shots into trees. The method is to place a circular container on the trunk of the tree, put the chemical drugs to be used in it, and then drill a hole in the trunk to mix the chemical drugs with the tree sap. It is said that the effect is very good. In addition, there are also those who use this method to treat trees or inject tonics.</p>

<h3 id="e104">A Record of Impressions of the Enthusiastic China-Supporter Claudette Colbert <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— New Shadow</p>
<p>At its peak, the China Relief movement in Hollywood Studios saw child star Shirley Temple salute Chinese children on behalf of American children, followed by superstar Claudette Colbert reading Madame Soong Ching-ling's letters on the radio. This is a noteworthy piece of news; therefore, I am very pleased to introduce Claudette Colbert in all her aspects to the readers of this magazine.</p>
<p>Born in France</p>
<p>When Claudette Colbert is mentioned, perhaps every movie fan knows her. On the screen, she speaks fluent English, but people may not know that she is not American, let alone British, but French! Her parents were also French. In 1913, they moved from France to America. Therefore, her education was entirely in the United States. For this reason, she can speak fluent English, so people wouldn't know she is French, but she also has a considerable foundation in French.</p>
<p>Loves Painting</p>
<p>Often, when she was studying, she did not want to become a movie star in her heart, and her wish was to become an artist, because she has always loved painting. But things sometimes turn out unexpectedly. Once, she met an American star who gave her a supporting role in her play. Just like others, she initially failed, and none of the plays she performed were successful. It wasn't until later that she became famous on the stage, and then moved from the stage to the screen. Good fortune followed.</p>
<p>The Filming Process</p>
<p>Since joining the film industry, Claudette Colbert's first work was with Bing Leong. Then she acted in a second one, but both of these films were complete failures. It wasn't until later, after acting in "Rain," that she became famous. From then on, she rose rapidly, changing from her past depression, and soon became one of Hollywood's leading actresses. Now, for her, it can be said that everyone has a deep impression.</p>
<p>Won a Golden Award</p>
<p>Since then, Claudette Colbert has not only gained fame on the screen, but also her acting skills have improved with time. In a very short period, she has received awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences three times. The most noteworthy is in 1933, she and Clark Gable won the award together for starring in "It Happened One Night." As for her private life, unlike other stars, she advocates simplicity and is very enthusiastic about charity on weekdays. But seeing her help China this time also makes me particularly excited!</p>

<p>— Wen</p>
<p>To celebrate the eighth anniversary of its establishment, China United Film Company has decided to publicly elect two major films and has entrusted China Film News to collect audience election letters. It is learned that once selected, they have decided to screen them publicly at the Shanghai Guangda Theater.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's new film "Soul Broken at Autumn River," following "Azure Seas and Blue Skies," has been renamed "Imperfect Moon and Faded Flowers" because the original title was not appealing enough. It is also rumored that the film has been decided to star Yuan Meiyun, Gu Yelu, Wang Xianzai, Zhang Wan, Yin Xiucen, Yuan Zhuru, and others.</p>
<p>Li Pingqian's new work "Where the Soul Returns," following "The Merry Widow," has been completely completed. The results of the test screening yesterday showed that Li Hong once again gave an amazing performance in the film.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan, who was hospitalized for treatment of a heart condition, has recovered and was discharged from the hospital yesterday to recuperate at home. It is said that she will return to the company to cancel her leave within days.</p>
<p>The Ye Wei Yang Theater Troupe, organized by Gu Yelu, He Bin, and others, will soon perform the play "Two Fated Lovers" at the Carlton Theatre. It is also rumored that Bai Hong, Murong Wan'er, Gu Yelu, and others have been internally designated to play the leading roles.</p>
<p>Sun Jing's new work following "The New Invisibility Technique" has been named "Spring River, Flower, Moon, Night." The main cast has also been selected, with Li Lihua, Zheng Chong, Wen Yiming, and others taking on the roles.</p>
<p>Li Qinian's new work, "Thief Beauty," following "The Merry Widow," was once renamed "Snake-like Beauty." Because the title was not stimulating enough, it is said that it has been decided to rename it again to "Romantic Female Thief."</p>
<p>Wang Xichun's first fashion production, "Wartime Jiaoyang," has been completely filmed and will be released at the New Guang Theatre soon. It is said that the story of the film narrates the tragic love history of the famous director Shi Dongshan and his wife Hua Jieni, and the plot is quite vivid.</p>
<p>Diao Banhua, who has been absent from the silver screen for a long time, recently suffered from severe pneumonia. It is said that she was sent to a sanatorium for treatment a week ago.</p>
<p>Since "Golden Capital" changed to exclusively screening "Guolian" second-run new films, it has invited Bian Yuying to be the film scheduling consultant for the theater. The "Golden Capital" authorities specially hosted a banquet at the Jin Gu Hotel to thank Mr. Bian a few days ago.</p>
<p>(Hava News Agency, Beiping, 3rd) The local Xinmin Bao recently published a Tianjin telegram, which briefly stated that the famous actor Ma Lianliang performed his signature play "The Eight Great Hammers" at the Chinese Grand Theater in Tianjin City the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, he made a big mistake on stage. Out of anger, he attempted suicide by jumping into the river in the French Concession that night. Later, he was rescued by concession police officers and sent to the actor's residence in the British Concession. After fourteen hours of rest, he continued to perform at the theater.</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: Gongsun's Sword Aura First</p>
<p>Then Liu Yin and Xu Jing each sat down, and Wang Yongtai also sat beside them to accompany them. Liu Yinying smiled and said: "Today, I unintentionally overheard Brother Jing muttering to himself in the study. Although I don't understand the cause of the incident, I know that you must have something on your mind that you are eager to deal with, so I paid attention to Brother Jing's actions at night. There is a door behind your room that leads to the kitchen. I was watching from there, and sure enough, I saw you quietly going out, about to go down the mountain for a walk. I am naturally curious and like to meddle in other people's affairs, so I immediately took my White Dragon Sword and followed you closely, all the way down the mountain. You climbed over the city wall, and I also climbed in the same way. When you arrived at the mansion of this old hero, I climbed over the wall to enter, and followed you directly to standing in front of the building window, peeking inside." As Liu Yinying said this, Xu Jing slapped his knee and said: "My dear brother's flying skills are several times higher than mine, otherwise how would I not know that someone was following me all the way? I am extremely ashamed." Wang Yongtai also nodded, stroking his beard and smiling. Liu Yinying continued: "At that time, I was young and liked to play tricks, and suddenly wanted to play a game with Brother Jing to test whether you would notice. So I lightly jumped behind you and took the opportunity to draw the Scarlet Phoenix Sword from your back. Later, you noticed and chased after me, so I led you to the back, wanting to ask you what was going on. But unexpectedly, at that time, I caught sight of a black shadow in the east, darting into the wall, which made me curious again. Before I could explain to you, I immediately dropped you and followed the black shadow again. I only saw that the black shadow was looking around, exploring the path. I followed him. He, like Brother Jing, did not realize that someone was behind him. He walked to a courtyard and drifted down. I stood on the roof, silently observing the movement. I saw a light shining through the side room below, knowing that there were people inside. The black shadow peered at the window for a while, then immediately drew a short knife from his waist, seeming to want to go inside and make a move. I guessed that he was a guest who had come here to commit murder. Coincidentally, I had a dart pouch with me, so I took out a poisoned dart and, taking advantage of his unpreparedness, shot a dart at his lower body, hitting his thigh. He shouted 'Ah ya' and immediately fell to the ground. When I jumped down, the old hero Wang had already heard the noise and leaped out from the room." (81)</p>
