<p>倫敦　可靠方面深信、邱吉爾首相昨日吿日大使重光葵稱、日本毫無建議出任調停歐戰之地位、據稱、邱氏曾吿重光葵氏云、日外相如果思建議調停歐戰、則英國實不悉該建議有何根據、衆悉、松岡上次之建議、係以私人之資格由日駐英大使重光葵轉交英外相艾登氏、可靠方面又稱、邱吉爾氏並吾認日人所傳謂英國在太平洋上之舉動、係欲包圍日本、英首相解釋、英國在太平洋預防措施、純係自衛起見、昨日當局並曾發表文吿、謂英國素對日本南進之危險、作淸晰之觀察云、（廿五日合衆社電）、</p>
<p>東京　內閣情報局發言人石井于答覆記者問題時稱、日本政府方考慮將外相松岡致英外相艾登之備忘錄全文發表、渠謂艾登與重光葵會談之內容、未得艾登氏之同意以先、不能發表云、（廿五日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　某權威界咋日在此間發表聲明稱、關干日本在太平洋南洋之危險、英國　曾作明確之立塲表示、此項聲明發出時、英首相邱吉爾方與駐英日本大使重光葵晤談、兩人曾回溯在倫敦及東京所舉行之迭次英日談話、該聲明稱、英國對於日本南進之關懐、于英外相艾登與日本大使重光葵之談話、及駐日英國大使克萊琪與松岡外相之談話中已說明云、（廿五日合衆社電）</p>

<p>大洋洲屬亞洲口號美國務院拒不批評</p>
<p>東京　日外相松岡頃稱、渠所致英外相艾登之備忘錄並未涉及德國、而所謂調停、亦不過係一枝節問題、松岡又評論日蘇關係、主張大洋洲係亞人之理想區域、並謂法日經濟談判、正在進行、松岡又反覆解釋日外次大橋所作之報吿（按大橋曾謂松岡致艾登之照會、其主要部分係吾認日本有侵略南方之意）、然松岡又稱、一旦理想成爲事實、則其致艾登之備忘錄、或可謂爲調停歐戰之建議、松岡此項陳述係在下院預算委員會答覆福田氏質問所伯、緣福田曾謂求松岡糧明外間對其致艾備忘録所起之誤會、日外相又稱、該地有充分爲此南北相距一千二百哩東西相距一千哩之大洋洲、應使其成爲亞洲人民之移殖地、該地有充分之天然富源、是以供給六萬萬至八萬萬人、予相信吾人有移民該地之天賦權利、依據理想上之主張、而處理實際政治、固非易事、但予以爲白種人應將大洋洲讓與亞洲人、（廿四日合衆社電）</p>

<p>倫敦　遠東局勢因昨日日外相松岡在國會發表白種人應將大洋洲議與亞洲人之警吿、今日似益較以往爲複雜、松岡此項宣言、已引起倫敦之驚詫、倫敦人士、認此項宣言、與先時英首相邱吉爾與日駐英大使重光葵談話時之外交空氣相較、竟成顯著之差異、緣英首相與日使之談話、此間英日人士均爲歡迎、認爲足以澄淸目下之空氣、而一般人士、亦認此項談話或有助於遠東局勢之鬆弛、聞邱吉爾曾語重光葵、謂渠個人對於日本常具一種熱烈之情感、並回憶英日同盟時代、尤以日俄戰爭期間、英日之關係何等愉快、又稱、鑒於以前之關係、設英日發生戰爭、誠爲一大悲劇、其時重光葵亦稱、日本無意在太平洋建立一第三種戰爭糾紛、今松岡之宜言、不特使人們對英首相日使之會談、另生一種新見解、且使所傳邱吉爾警吿重光葵時所稱、設日本堅持南進政策、將使遠東之緊張局勢、益趨危險等語、更增其重要性、並聞邱吉爾又曾語重光葵、謂英國雖無攻擊日本之意、但爲英國安全起見、或將被迫而採取若干計劃、此間人士又稱，英首相並曾吿日使、謂英國之戰爭目的、自前首相張伯倫時代以來迄未改變、即抱定決心使歐洲脫離德國侵略之威脅是也、英首相此語、當已使重光葵心中對英國之目的、毫無疑慮、一般又料、邱吉爾在最近之將來、或將向下院對英國之還東政策爲一完備之陳述、又可靠方面稱、渠等並知、邱吉爾業已通吿日使、謂日本無建議調停歐戰之理由云、（二十五日合衆社電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　此間輿情認太平洋將吾發生戰事、猶在未定之天、和戰機會、各佔半數、美國近已深知新加坡與美國之重要關係、設新加坡落於日人之手、則美國橡皮錫鎢之供給勢將中斷、而美國安全亦將更受威脅矣、東京其亦知美國對新加坡與荷印之重視乎、抑仍料美國艦隊無論如何不敢出夏威夷一步、局勢關鍵即在於此、日外相松岡因建議調停歐戰致受德國責難而稍受窘態、觀此可見日方此舉並未依照德國計盡、而日本政策仍屬機會性質、蓋非爲軸心計畫中一部之說、顯愈有力、日本南進中首當戰事之衝者、爲其海軍、乃近來發表在論者、全屬陸軍中人、而海軍獨默然無語，此亦爲此間人士視爲曉有意義之一事也、（二十五日路透電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>太平洋形勢的日弛</h3>
<p>無論從那個角度探究，這十多天來日本的朝野內外所表現者，總指明他不像有立刻對英美挑起大戰的決心和準備；而在英美決意應戰的宣言及行動準備下，日本方面，却很明顯的呈現了許多年來最大的手忙脚亂的惶急狀態。太平洋的根本危機不但沒有過去，且正向更深刻處醖釀，但僅僅就大戰爆發這一演變着想，確不能不令人覺得近日形勢稍見鬆弛，似乎又可暫時拖延一下了。這些天來。日本除了改變方針，集中全力，向英美解釋及表明自己的『和平意向』外，現在他各方面對於對抗英美基本策略的論調是：萬一英美進攻，日本有着充足的準備云云。當然，英美是不至於馬上先行進攻日本的，所以這是一句多餘的話！</p>
<p>原先英美方面所担心的一點，就是德義軸心所加於日本的壓力，逼他嚮應未來的德義攻勢，在東方有所動作；而在目前這種國際形勢下，確也難於想像日本如何可以正面抵抗這類壓力。日前日本松岡外相表示日本願意替歐洲調停息戰，很可能的推想爲德義壓力的反應。這消息傳出後，德國官方立刻就表示不滿，吾認事前與聞這一提議；且以爲强調求和是弱者的表示，德國並非弱者，所以無希望和平的必要。但英國方面除了沒有正式答覆日本的提議外，却爲爭取國際有利的空氣起見，表示謂縱使德國事前沒有與聞，然而日本是德國的同盟者；這在英國方面所有的同盟國家，却並沒有一國這樣的示弱。據聞，德國因此對日本十分憤懣，由駐日大使正式向日方有所詰責而日本當局也就不得不有所吾認，且歸咎於英國的宣傳和曲解。到底這一幕的眞象如何，留待將來外交史來解答；而當前値得加以推論者，却有兩面：一面以日本的最後趕緊吾認來說，到底說明了牠無法抵抗德義壓力的形勢；又一面，在關係到牠自己存亡的太牛洋大戰問題上，至少在目前，牠尙未聽從德義孤注一擲的意願，而在用着種種逃避的方法。今後短期內德義與日本間誘逼與閃躱力量的決賽，即是太平洋問題的關鍵之一；在這一點還沒有結論前，大的還可以暫時苟安。</p>
<p>十多天前，另一個使英美十分担心的問題，是日本方面對於英美近來在遠東各種積極舉措的可能反應。一面是美國租借法案」的通過手續完成在即，同時英美在遠東對日本包圍形勢，又逐漸增强，及包圍圈的逐漸縮小。這樣下去，日本「大東亞新秩序」迷夢實現的可能，確實是日見遞减。然則夙稱具有剖腹精神的日本，也許會不顧成敗利鈍，以壯烈行動來反抗這個在實際上的打擊。即如日本突然侵人泰國，衝擊截斷中國對外的西南通路，使將來美國大規模的接濟，無法運抵中國；這不是意外的行動。又如對於美國在關島的設防，日本歷來屢次聲稱在必要時不惜運用武力反對；現在美國却終於小顧一切，毅然通過了在離日本本部僅僅一千五百哩關島設防的議案；那末，日本也許會迫着立刻向美國提出嚴重抗議，一等美國置之不理，牠也許會立即貿然動用武力。像這一類的問題，任何一個都有引起太平洋大戰的充分可能。但是十多天來的事實表現，並不如此緊張惡劣。日本除了對於英美的强硬步驟，絲毫沒有提出什麼有效對策的暗示外，且在牠那些對英美竭力解釋之中，流露了非常深刻的恐懼因素。這個恐懼，却又顯然並不僅僅限於少數政府當局，而實在是普遍到牠國民的各階層；無論從最近牠的議會論辯，或是各主要報紙的表示，總可以證明這一點。松岡在致艾登的牒文裏，據說曾請求英美不必過份刺激日本國民情緒，以免向極端衝進，使當局無法的束，造成戰爭的爆發；可是最近連續放在大家面前的，却反而是日本全國紛紛對政府當局緩和與英美關係的關心，要求和建議。所以，如果說他們還覺得自已政府動作有所不夠的話，勢必也祗有在於緩和企圖這一面，而絕對不在於怨恨政府的不夠積極和强硬，日本的海軍急進派，以前曾經强調過「美國不足畏」，而痛詆日本國民一部份中所謂「恐美病」的存在，可是到了最近，面臨美日戰爭重大決定的關口，連這些急進者自身，也都不再在妄發言了；而海軍方面的野村大將，却就是努力緩和對美關係企圖中的一、個非常重要角色。然則，何以傾向若此鬆弛？無疑的，因爲英美態度强硬，以行動表示了絕對不妥協！</p>

<h3>英發明新方法對付德潛艇戰德稱毀英船逾廿一萬噸倫敦官方斥爲虛偽宣傳</h3>
<p>倫敦　本日消息、希特勒曾以「夢想不到」之潛艇閃電戰術爲恫嚇、但英海軍對此項恫嚇之答覆、爲施用最新發明之捕毀潛艇秘法、當潛艇戰爭在春季加劇之時、英國之驅逐艦捕雷艦等、不獨將防制潛艇、並將實行更有效之進攻戰、此項進攻戰係自法國失敗以後所從未會有者、英海軍之防潛艇戰略、係在戰事中之最謹守秘密者、但悉海軍研究專家已費時數月、發明新方法以代替或增强已成陳腐之舊式探尋潛艇方法、不久即將施用新方法、以大事增强海軍防潛艇警衛之效能、並恢復戰事初啟時數月內之狀况、當時船隻之損失極少、而施行襲擊之潛艇每日皆有被毀滅者、一九四〇年下半年、英國船隻之損失增加、官方並未釋明其故、但或因法國被佔、德國獲得法艦隊之一部有以致之、外交觀察家猜度因英法協的之密切、則英國將防止潛艇設備之重要秘密讓與法國、亦屬意中事、英國方法之基本原理、顯已本爲德方對法國船隻曾加騐看、故德方獲悉英國之新設備及其施用方法之詳細情形、故潛艇之司令得更加愼防被獲云、（二十五日合衆電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間負責人士聲稱、希特勒昨日午後演說中所稱德方已擊沉敵船逾二十萬噸一節、實屬憑距離眞相甚遠之幻想、而由德方前所揚言者予以證明、例如迦維灣英護航隊被襲專、德方揚言已擊沉整個護航隊八萬六千噸、實則該護航隊三十八艘船隻中、有三十三艘安然抵港云、（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　二月十四日德方公報所稱、德國某襲擊船曾擊沉護航隊之船隻十四艘、共的八萬二千噸一節、已由海軍部之布吿證明其虛僞、據稱截至二月十六日爲止之一週中、商船之損失共爲十二艘、共三七、六三六噸、其中十一艘屬英、協的國船隻僅有一艘、該布吿又稱、希特勒演說中所云、過去數日中德方曾擊沉船隻二十一萬五千噸云云、並無其事、（二十五日路透電）</p>

<p>納粹運動歷史國社</p>
<p>黨奮鬥迄今已歷二十一年、而仍能與諸君共語一堂一此在歷史上亦不多見、今有一人仍爲其二十一年前之理想與主義、不折不撓繼續奮鬥、且已付諸實行、此亦爲前所未見、本黨組織之初、即以德國全民族之利益爲前提、此項主張貫澈至今、始終未變、德國二次大戰之失敗及遭遇凡爾賽和的之壓迫、其原因乃由於政治上之錯誤、在戰前已種下禍根、非自戰後始焉、當時政治領袖對內政外交均未有適當之措施、但有一點則未能歸咎於當時之政治領袖、即彼等實不需要戰爭、倘彼等需要戰爭、則早有充份之準備矣、何至結果陷於戰敗、軍事上雖亦犯有錯誤、但德國士兵與敵人堅持至四年之久、此爲世界人士所同聲驚歎、由此可知德國之戰敗、並非由於前綫作戰不力、實爲內政腐化所致當時德國有兩種政治理想發生磨擦、即國家主義與社會主義之衝突是也、影響所及、乃使國家分崩離析、國社主義運動乘勢崛起之後、余深知算得全民族之擁護、即不能改善德國之內政外交、國社主義運動遂以此目標努力邁進、</p>
<p>擺脫和約桎梏當時吾人</p>
<p>所受外來之壓迫、即凡爾賽和的是也、其時余在此間發表第一次演說、即以德國遭受此莫大侮辱、促全國人民生聚雪恥、此項條的使德國民族之政治與經濟有覆滅之禍、在外交上則德國之一切權利盡被剝奪、賠款之重、幾使德國民族在經濟上無復興之望、當時德國經濟之困難、失業人數之激增、生活標準之急降、人口减少、經濟奴役之苦、寳再無甚於此者矣、於是激起資產階級與勞動階級之鬥爭、漸漸引起世界之同情、但國社運動之主義則爲「汝能自助、天將助汝」、最初發起國社運動之時、吾等即深知凡爾賽和的決非優柔寡斷所能解除、必須雄厚之國力始能擺脫此次桎梏、國社運勳於是努力肅淸國內之政黨、先求內政之修明、歐洲發生此兩大革命、國社主義與法西斯主義革命、獲得同樣之結果、</p>
<p>德義禍福相共但世</p>
<p>人初則未加注意、以爲德國國力衰弱、民意不振、決不致形成此社會洪流、國社主義與法西斯主義遂互助邁進、團結力之堅、非普通之盟誼所能及、吾國之敵人當時實不能瞭解余已交得一友人、且彼此之敵人相同、故均抱互相扶助之誠意、最近雜大利助吾作戰、在非洲牽制英國之陸海空軍、即其明證也、</p>
<p>對英發動海戰余抵</p>
<p>此二小時前、曾接獲海軍總司令之報吿、謂吾國潛水艇之活動、近又擊沉敵船二十一萬五千噸、自三月至四月諸君將見更激烈之行動、屆時將證明吾人是吾已因冬季而蟄伏、吾國急降轟炸機今已使北海及地中海之英國船隻、不獲自由行動、總之、英國足跡所至之處、吾人必將羅逐之、英國輪船航行所經之地、吾國之潛水艇將襲擊之、一九四一年之春、英國將向大陸進攻、余正守候其進攻、英　已在他處發動其攻勢、但敵人所至之地、吾人必出而迎擊、予以最重大之打擊、希特勒繼表示其進行談判及解除武裝之願望稱、余願遵循談判途徑、解決一切、談判可以减輕流血犧牲、完成所望、吾人決非蠢然無知、可以公理解決之事、而以武力行之、但德國須要生存、故必須獲得生存所必需之條件、他人無剝奪吾人生活權利之理由、已經擁有領土三千八百萬方公里之國家、不應再向另一國家奪取二百五十萬方公里之土地、不能再容忍他國之統治、聽從其强迫吾人遵行之經濟政策、（未完）</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（卅）（七）保加利亞的窘境</h3>
<p>在戰略上，一九四一年保加利亞的處境宛如一九四〇年的荷蘭比利時。</p>
<p>德國戰略在擊是在擊敗英國，但是英國可望而不可接，於是在去年五月假道荷蘭比利時攻入法國，以冀殲滅英法聯軍的主力。到了今年，這種主力已移至地中海線東部，例如希臘軍已攻至阿爾巴尼亞，英軍及澳洲軍則在北菲洲義大利屬地利比亞，節節進展，德軍軍隊除假道南斯拉夫和保加利來亞外，更無其他途徑可以直撲不列顛帝國，南斯拉夫保加利亞乃與荷蘭比利時易地而處了。</p>
<p>保加利亞內閣總理費洛夫曾往維也納，和柏林等處，名爲訪名醫愛賓權，診治胃潰瘍。他的行踪一時成爲新聞記者的目標。他此行是否別有作用，外人不得而知。但保加利亞外交部曾發表奇特的聲明，謂德車如要求假道開往希臘，保加利亞除接受以外，更無他法。同時柏林方面對於外交部長李本特洛浦的行踪，也諱莫如深。</p>
<p>費洛夫在維也納逗留五天後返國，並即向各報訪員隱的地說道，「美國方面盛傳我有德國之行，全非事實。」但他返京後的翌日，即急急忙忙趕到四十三英里外的科里亞地方，覲見國王鮑利斯三世，報吿此行療疾經過。次日父和國王再度商議一切，當晚又趕回京中召集內閣非常會議。</p>
<p>費洛夫如此僕僕風塵，當然有比他的胃潰瘍更嚴東的事情，質言之，就是保加和亞可吾尤德軍假道攻希。保加利亞如何決定原是無關宏旨，德軍儘可不顧一切强制通過。但是一來恐將牽動蘇聯，和土耳其却是不可忽略的事實。</p>
<p>鮑利斯是一個和藹可親的國王。他雖躬與巴爾幹幾次戰役及上次世界大戰，但極願享受昇平氣象，常喜微服出行，修埋機器，玩弄獵犬，和農民談天，使人相信他不以權貴自居。他曾說過，「倘我失去王位，實在不足介意。他日果爾應騐，我便逕自到美國當一名機器匠也好。」</p>
<p>保加利亞目下旣爲時局的焦點鮑利斯也就成爲各方壓迫的中心。他所管轄的是斯拉夫民族。他的血統大部份出於法國。他的親戚都是英國，比利時，葡萄牙和羅馬尼亞的王族。王后愛安娜是義大利公主。他本人信奉希蠟正敎，莎皇尼古拉斯二世原是他的敎父。他的父王斐迪南則出亡德國已二十二年了。</p>
<p>除了這些私人關係外，保加利亞是蘇聯在歐洲最親密的與國，同時又爲德國向近東擴展必經之路。最近有人問鮑利斯，保加利亞的外交政策究竟如何，他回答道，「我的內閣親德，王后親義，我的百姓則親蘇聯，全國只有我一個人是中立份子。」</p>
<p>鮑利斯出這言論，實非過甚其辭。保加利亞民族的語言，文化，習俗，血統，情感都接近蘇聯，但內閣各大臣，特別是內閣總理費洛夫和內政部長嘉勃洛維斯基則都主張唯德國之命是從。王后當然偏袒義大利，只有鮑利斯在可能範圍內，力主保加利亞應由保加利亞人獨立自主。可是他的主張難有實現的可能。去年十一月，他剛訪問柏林歸來，德國空軍部長戈林上將就向保加利亞訪員說，「貴國國王保守中立，太嫌過份，與我輩格格不入。好在歐洲新局面中不再會有帝王們的地位了。」</p>

<p>犯規纍纍四人罰出</p>
<p>下半時開始曼思魯奇連得三分、又成三十四之平手、復成二十七比三十六、是爲滬隊第二次之超出、滬隊體力似差、長力不如、形勢漸教落、四十一比四十八時、亨沙惠茲罰出、四十一比四十九、對方飽爾罰出、亨出、陳學崇再進、飽出祥生進、飽爾旣出、滬隊乘虛而入、又力趕成四十七比四十九、僅差二分、惜未能再進、四十八比五十六、李震中罰出、任相成進、四十八比五十九、客隊主將喔茄拉亦罰出、總計下半時中、大將罰出達四名之多、琴金斯最後調出陳學崇、聲勢又振、一氣連得十分、惜乎時間已至、總結六十八比六十三僅差五分、</p>
<p>客隊分得美金一百</p>
<p>昨晚上下客滿、樓下十元券一百五十張、樓上七元券四百張，如數售完、共應得四千三百元、此賽係回力球塲西經理阿沙杜林及沙弗利斯之介紹接洽而成、據勃拉脫稱、美隊要求分美金一百元外、餘數則將作爲慈善捐款云、</p>

<h3>金價終疲</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤漲風雖烈、而後市回跌亦慘、結果反見軋落五元、晨市承上日之堅勢、故幾度在升、中間因有獲利了結、而呈盤旋之狀、但外匯終報軟化、迨至午刻、德孚成記大豐等猛抬、即出六千三百元外、達六千三百二十元、午收亦吿六千三百十三元、後市開盤頗昂、不久再經翁源等吸收、升逹六千三百五十元頂峯、奈此後反動極烈、蓋利空流言、使人心受震、大致關於英美撒僑與太平洋又吿嚴重之消息所致、德孚等吐售不少、撳至六千二百二十元、收盤比上日小五元、又現貨行市的比期貨高五百元、全日期交一萬餘　、銀樓飾金仍六百九十元、關金等平、</p>
<p>晨初承上日買風、開盤賣戶缺乏、散戶稍抬、逹六千二百五十元、比上日做高一十五元、未幾浮多塞出、回低二十元、爲六千二百三十元、嗣因外匯有趨緊模樣、故新豐永等力購、猛烈上升、斯時已達六千二百八十五元、後為同康永但記仁承永等吐售、壓低至六千三百十五元、但成記見賤來撈、同康永亦反手買進、於是漸升至六千二百九十元、然新豐永又乘高塞出、重撳達六千二百三十元、終聞外匯軟化、人心堅俏、德孚成記德大大豐等莫不前來吸收，收盤前上升竟出六千三百元外、達六千三百二十元、午後尙有六千三百十三元、後市開盤續昂、爲六千三百三十五元、稍頃降低二十元、退爲六千三百十五元、惟鑫元德大等進意仍殷、再拉高至六千三百五十元、不料利空流言突播、人心鬆動、賣風遂起、成記德大德孚等吐售甚多、倐又回落至六千二百二十元、乃吿收槃、比上日反軋小五元、收後塲外的做六千二百二十五元、全日上落一百三十五元、現金號之本牌金售價較烚赤（現貨）高十餘元、辦進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金未有更動</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、未有更動、計大同行懸六百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收推低三十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣尙見平穩</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、漲後回平、英美金鎊亦係先漲後回、卒吿平穩、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票於午後曾高至八角七分、卒爲十七元六角二分、比上日軋跌三分、香港票略趨軟化、晚市爲四元三角九分、日金票及朝鮮票需要甚殷、市價一致挺漲、前者高至一元七角六分半、後者升爲一元三角九分半、</p>
<h3>紗花棉紗購買又見踴躍棉花廠需不暢</h3>
<p>紗市續升、目趨勢向上、此因外滙軟弱、空頭抵補、並傳某幫復來收進、雙馬由空翻多、於是檯面轉緊、市盤乃昂、又說紗廠方面開支、以百物昂實、隨之增高、所以有一部份傾向拖進市象逐步前進、二十支雙馬高價爲一千三百四十元、低價爲一千三百十一元、午後上落浩大、初做一千三百四十五元、漸後跌至一千三百十五元又升至一千三百四十元、最後收盤價爲一千三百三十六元、有人要進、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日午後堅挺之氣續進、且塲中買者多而賣者少、因之檯面殊緊、首盤價爲一千三百〇六元、此盤一開、競購者踴躍、直升至一千三百二十元、中途因盈利者吐出、回至一千三百十一元、旋後全價大升、逐步漲至一千三百四十元收盤、査半日間成交、統計六千五百七十包、行情漲三十元、廿六日有棉紗四百三十件運香港、六件運厦門、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　二六〇　厦門　一〇</p>
<p>同行六、三〇〇統計六、五七〇</p>
<p>現棉情况、銷路依然曙淡、廠方需要不暢、不過大都直向海外購訂、所以成交較稀、然行情隨紗市而增高數　、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因現貨商頻購、繼之又因華爾街股票猛漲、市况乃星活潑堅昂之態、牧盤價格、較之上日漲高四至十四磅音不等、</p>
<p>印棉平平、昨日預測僅高半羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易平淡、雖同業略有互做、但各廠方購意呆滯、目下並不感到具趣、</p>
<h3>疋頭坯銷路發展東疋發見偽棧單</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢又堅、乃因東疋開價高昂、華廠坯布銷路發展、售盤亦見挺秀、白貨細布斜紋每疋漲五角至一元、粗布漲二角半至五角、三月份申新富貴細布晨市四十一元、午後四十二元、廠關小額叫十二元、富貴細斜晨開三十五元半、午後三十六元半，廠開三十七元、染染布平平、本街成交各布五百餘件、浙閩幫辦色布粗細布一百餘件、粵港幫辦色布、色料等二百餘件、北路烟津幫辦府綢、色布等一百餘件、二十六日疋頭運厦門二十七件、連香港四百九十五件、</p>
<p>東布　漲風又燉、（取引所）龍頭標布期貨　市三月份開盤在升至四十九元〇一分、惟收盤時因黃金回跌、浮多獲利轉賣、壓低至四十七元七角、四月份四十八元三角、五月份四十九元三角六分、現貨市塲則以發生僞棧單糾紛、全日停市、而同業心思高昂、暗盤交易、仍有做開、十二磅飛魚細布四十七元五角、龍頭細布四十七元、四君子嗶幾一元三角、</p>
<h3>糖市糖價平定</h3>
<p>昨糖市無甚更動、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白外棧七十九元半至七十九元八角、三月十日打單八十元三角至八十元、八十元一角、三月二十日打單仍八十元六角、荷赤六十一元二角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十九元半、東棧七十九元、DY嘜七十八元二角、國產新刁靑因產價仍難合劃、尙乏運到、陳貨亦無成交、</p>
<h3>油市油餅市塲取締期貨買賣現貨影響甚微</h3>
<p>油餅市塲、因被投機控制、交易狀態頗屬驚駭、怪聲叫喊、比交易所時代尤形嘈雜、大都是賣空買空、一旦失利、糾紛頻起、先前已發生多起、故該市塲當局爲未雨綢繆計、特公吿市塲、取締期貨賣買、致全部油餅期貨交易、因之停頓、現貨市面上落無幾、做開膠州生油一百件、價爲一百零五六元、烟台生油五十件、價爲一百零四元、又聽裝生油一千聽、價爲一百三十八元、靑島生油五十桶、價爲一百四十七元、江北本坊生油三十桶、價爲一百四十二元、大有廠豆油一百担、價爲九十一元元、大連豆油五十桶，價爲一百十九元、甡記豆餅五百片、價爲十四元八角半、肥字餅十車價爲十四元八角至八角半、元隆餅五車、價爲十四元九角至十五元、利宇餅一千片、價爲十四元六角、至發字餅一千片、價爲十四元七角半、</p>
<p>又今日（二十六日）出口、有豆子六百叫十包、及生仁三百二十包、運往厦門、另有豆子二百包、豆餅九千二百片、豆油一千聽、及生油五百五十件、並五百聽、俱運香港、</p>
<h3>煤炭淮南煤銷塲不惡</h3>
<p>淮南烟煤、自月前首批新貨裝到後、本街銷塲尙稱不惡、故日昨又有二千二百噸抵埠、由某洋行經理代售、同業拆價、淮南蹄塊每噸一百七十六元、煤屑一百五十四元、質以屑子較佳、篩塊多石質、故去路亦以上者爲廣、</p>
<h3>藥材潮皮看升</h3>
<p>潮皮到貨久乏、市上行號存貨俱缺、即普通貨亦將吿罄、故趨勢甚緊、昨聞號方消息、產區新貨正在設法運出、惟成本自必增高、大的比前價漲有二三十元、</p>
<h3>雜項洋燭一漲三元</h3>
<p>白禮氏船牌洋燭、因原料來源、發生問題、昨公司方面行盤、每箱二十五封、漲價二元、新價爲一十一元四角、其餘各牌、賣價一致趨高、</p>
<h3>五金竹節鋼條徘徊</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條市面、日衆似呈徘徊狀態、蓋北洋幫及長江路內河客商等銷胃岑寂、而本街方面因建築事業未見興盛、故建築幫對於該貨之買賣亦未見熱鬧、市象內之仍蕭條、致標準售盤隨見下拌、刻如三分四分之細花色每噸開二千零五十元、而五分以上之粗貨則每噸僅售二千元、此外如本廠元釘·扎鐵絲·新盤元·等諸貨、大多亦四實銷不展、市勢徘徊、　價軟化、刻本釘一百元、新盤元一百十元、扎鐵絲九十元、較之前市皆多落少漲耳、</p>
<h3>海味建菰續漲</h3>
<p>國產福建香菰、邇來到貨仍乏、市存愈見稀少、故市價冉度上漲、昨市較高者售至七百十元、次之六百九十元、比前又升二十餘元、</p>
<h3>國產香菰軋缺</h3>
<p>國產香菰、到存供稀、市上僅福建貨一種、價爲六百七十八元、日貨較高者八百七十五元、次之八百零九元、冬菰高貨一千一百五十元、普通八白八十元、市象俱堅、不易見鬆、</p>
<h3>經濟業譚鐘表漏刻（續）</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>然而以寗國府這樣人家，後來抄家，只抄出鐘表十八件·嘉慶年聞，和紳抄家，所抄出的大自鳴鐘有十座，小自鳴鐘一百五十六座，桌鐘三百座，時辰表八十個，如今一家鐘表店，恐尙不及和珅家中所藏之豐富，在昔淸宮中喜用八音鐘，稱爲鬧鐘，淸宮詞泳其事云：</p>
<p>「珍珠爲帳縟芙蓉，歌舞初停便放慵，夢覺每疑猶作樂，八音新式鬧時鐘。」</p>
<p>表何以得名，此則又須回溯到中國舊時所用表，係立八尺之表，以測日影而求時刻，即周官大司徒以土圭之法正日景以求地中也。自西洋鐘表流入，中國旣以其鐘能自嗚，名之曰自嗚鐘：乃以其不嗚而可藏之於懐者，用中國舊時測景之表名之，而曰表。今人有以其用金屬　，乃於表字左旁加一金字，而爲簽字，轉失原來定名本意，然大多數仍爲作表。</p>
<p>表非畫不能發曾，打餐金表，即按健銀能作聲以報時刻也。在昔表之稱，有稱之爲自行表，亦稱之爲時辰表，惟通稱皆曰表。</p>
<p>鐘表在淸初，尙如是珍奇，道光年間，海禁開後，流通漸廣。同光之際，郭嵩燾致李鴻意書，則已云「鐘表玩具，家皆有之」，然終不如今日社會上之普遍也。</p>
<p>中國舊時無鐘表，則用漏刻，即銅壺滴漏也。漏刻之制，由來最久，周禮所謂挈壺氏，主挈壺水以爲漏，以水火守之，分以日夜，所以視漏刻之盈縮，辨昏且之短長是也。</p>

<h3>國共兩黨融洽無間統一陳線益堅凝外傳種種純係惡意中傷整飭軍紀各方絕對擁護</h3>
<p>據最近自中國內地抵此之某外籍權威觀察家稱、國民黨一部人士與共產黨間之關係、雖略呈緊張之勢、然國共間之「統一陣綫」、固仍融洽無間、國共雙方確有「爭執存乎其間、然外間所傳種種、純爲蓄意破壊中國統一之人士、有意造謠中傷、中國軍事當局對新四軍所採取之整飭軍紀辦法、雖被認爲「激烈手段」、然並未在國內引起不利之影響、輿情咸認此舉爲整飭軍紀所應採之辦法、</p>
<p>國共雙方並無裂痕</p>
<p>該觀察家繼稱、不參加國民政府之眞正共產黨份子、對新四軍解散一事、不無憤慨、然如周恩來等、對政府解散新四軍命令、均泰然處之、且設法調和國共間現有之糾紛、同時、此項舉動、爲國民黨一部份人士所主張、大部份之國民黨黨員、並不預聞此事、故決不能認之爲國共分裂、</p>
<p>蔣委員長威信益著</p>
<p>而國民黨一部份人所以力主整飭軍紀者、實因共產黨之軍隊、不服從最高軍事當局所發表之命令、此點即左派人士亦加以承認、共產軍隊之解散、衆信爲「罪有應得」、與中國立塲之相反者雖將該事予以誇大、殊不知蔣委員長受各方之擁戴、反因此一事件之解決、而更提高其威信、因自該事件發生後、各方皆重申其對蔣委員長之效忠、</p>
<p>統一陣綫異堅强</p>
<p>該外國觀察家在自由中國各處旅行時、曾與各種人士接談、此類人士、下自農工、上至政府官吏、軍隊長官、從無有一人承認「統一陣綫」有被分裂之虞者、即共產黨領袖、亦作如此想也、同時各負責方面、咸信自由主義雖時被人認爲共產主義、但在戰爭時期中、仍許可自由主義之流行、並准各方自由發表思想、</p>
<p>叛國之輩無可活動</p>
<p>該觀察家稱、中國之「靑年軍隊中」、儘多眞正的自由主義者、彼等咸抱有改良社會之信念、希望實行社會革命、以爲民衆謀福利、當談及自由中國之一般政治發展時、該觀察家稱、國民黨之實力强大、爲無可吾認之事實、最近數月來、政黨領袖加强黨的組織、結果所藏匿於自由中國中之叛國份子及桀傲不馴之徒、其活動之機會、已大爲减少、此種情形、爲自由戰爭發生以來所僅見、</p>

<h3>大批美僑今日撤退歸國庇亞士輸艙位亦經預定項培上校勗商團團員</h3>

<p>項培上校臨別贈言</p>
<p>萬國商團司令項培上校、自一九三七年十二月就職以來、至本月二十四日午夜任滿、於今日乘柯立芝總統輪離滬、其遺職由該商團老練軍官曼恩中校繼任、項培上校臨行前、對其部下曾作臨別贈言、共辭日、在余將萬國司令一職交卸於繼任人之前、余對各團員自一九三七年在余統領之下所完成之良好工作、甚爲欣慰與感謝、在過去三年間、萬國商團曾担任額外之工作、其最顯著者、爲去年十二月間、英軍撤退以後之公共租界乙區防務工作、余確信每一團員、已盡其最大之努力、余深知乙區之防務工作、已犧牲諸位休息之時間、同時余並向團內之高級軍官致謝、彼等之良好勸吿、密切合作及友誼、使余獲得不少幫助、余對於本團之志同道合、及眞正之國際精神、甚爲重視、而對於諸君之好客與善意、尤爲感激、余此次離滬、良用歉然、但此後上海愉快之回憶、將常在余之腦際、萬國商團過去已有良好之成績、此後保持此種成績、亦在諸君每一人之努力、謹祝諸君前途光明、克享未來之佳運與繁榮、</p>

<p>上海萬國商團全團軍官、於前晚六時半、就商團俱樂部、爲項培上校餞行、到該團所屬各國隊長及高級官佐等九十餘人、當由全團軍官會委員長華隊隊長陳時俠少校主席、卽席出陳氏代表全團各隊長官致詞惜別、公贈銀器禮物一事、上鐫各高級官長簽名式、以誌紀念、旋由該司令起立答謝、並回贈該軍官會電鐘一座、藉表戀戀、該司令演詞對全體團員消除國界偏見爲公安合作服務之大我精神、頗致稱許、至八時半始各歡散、</p>
<h3>工部局董事選舉美候選人確定日僑於下週從事競選人數比例可維持現狀</h3>

<h3>工部局設新委員會研究開闢稅源根據章程檢討捐稅權限各業領照範圍設法擴充</h3>
<p>工部局頃准如經濟委員會所屬「研究稅收小組委員會」之建議、決定另設一小組委員會、隸屬於財務委員會、負責研究新稅源，以裕收入、共仟務爲研究（一）按照定章、可以飭其領照而事實上並未實行之各業方面情形、（二）各業領照範圍、可吾予以擴充、（三）整個新稅源、委員人選、計爲奚玉書·格渡·海爾·李德爾·岡本及薩杜克君等六人、均屬經濟委員會所屬「研究稅源委員會」委員、新委員會所提建議、倘經採納、將盡力促其實現、各界對於此項問題、如願發表意見者、可以書面遞送該會秘書愛倫君、研究稅源小組委員會之最後報吿書、附錄如下、</p>
<p>徵稅權限重予考慮</p>
<p>（一）建議設置新委員會、开究開源之道、査本會首次報告書中所討論者、僅屬提增照費問題、其原因（甲）爲徵收照費、經定章明白規定、使工部局與納稅人方面在一種範圍以內、有此權限而無疑義者、（乙）本會認爲自本年度開始之時起、局方有急乎增加收入之必要、本會據調査所得、目下局方所微捐稅、限於地稅·房捐·廣告稅·執照費。碼頭捐以及公共事業特許費等等、而地皮章程所授予局方徵稅之權力、因其歷史上及習慣上之解釋、迄仍絕對限於上述各項捐稅之徵收、並未變更、本會對於地皮章程中關於此層之相沿的解釋、雖未嘗進一步加以檢討、但認爲局方不宜狃於積習、爲市政財務方面着想、擴充捐稅範圍、確有必要、應即就地皮章程及附章所付予納稅人徵稅之權限方面、重行考慮、關於照費一層、本會所討論者、僅就事實上現所徵收之各項、此類可以飭令領照之各業、均經特別臚列定章之中、深知另有若干項事業、照章可以飭其領照、而未嘗實行、一若局方以爲本身無此權限者然、本會認爲局方應即重加研究、俾各業領照範圍、得以設法擴充、基上種種、本會建議另設一經常小組委員會、隸屬於財務委員會員責研究以上種種問題</p>
<p>捐稅工作組織完善</p>
<p>（二）關於財務處捐稅股、査捐稅股之工作、頗爲繁複、一部份係屬財務上者、如收捐·估計房租·以及發照等等、另一部份則與財務無關者、涉及選舉人姓名表之編製、局方選舉與納稅人大會事宜、査該股係於一九三二年由總辦處改隸財務處、改組計劃之重要部份、在戰前已吿完成、上年曾於市區內添設收捐分處九所、以利捐務、並添雇華籍稽査員十一人、以代外籍職員之擔任同樣職務者、結果成績良佳、無論工作時間與車資方面、均見减縮、至就捐稅股之組識而言、其工作之有力與經濟情形、頗稱滿意、</p>

<p>五十分、法商十七·十八·廿四路無軌電車、及廿一·廿二路公共汽車、於行駛期間、突然臨時怠工停駛、致各馬路途中、均有車輛停頓、尤以辣斐德路貝勒路附近、停頓之公共汽車、達十餘輛、而十七·十八路無軌電車、大部均集中於南陽橋附近、致法租界內之公共交通事業、一時完全停頓、迨至四時二十分、始由公司當局勸導復工、各車司機售票方繼續工作、各路車輛得以</p>
<p>照常行駛</p>
<p>但恐沿途發牛事件、各路無軌電車及公共汽車、均以三輛同時魚貫開駛、以防意外、至此次突然罷工、綠昨日下午三時、呂班路電車公司前、即發生新老工人數十人鬥毆、當時被拘者有十餘名、新工人係加入「工會」者、同時各處均有新老工人毆打情事、入晚六時卅分、大世界前、亦有是項爭鬥、並有十七路電車一輛、亦被工人以石磚投擲、損毀停駛、咋晚六時、各</p>
<p>電車司機</p>
<p>售票人等、又實行怠工、致汰大馬路與霞飛路一帶往來各路電車、突然停頓、致近百輛電車、一字長蛇式停在路中、即經公司當局與警務當局派出幹員調解、的歷半小時、亦即恢復原狀、</p>

<p>豆米行業暨雜糧油餅業兩同業公會、昨晚委派陳子彝朱子香符前耕、持文晋謁公共租界工部局何德奎副總辦、並要求（一）委派人員、會同米業調査人員、分赴各米糧堆棧徹查存糧、（二）代電香港政府、准將運滬米糧照常出口、以濟滬市民食、今當局已尤照辦、對米業各項措置、囑照議辦理、又昨傳有國米數十萬包、可於本月底或十月初運滬、如果屬實、米價可趨好轉、</p>

<h3>堅守太平洋外壘中國必長期作戰（三）</h3>
<p>— 宋子文</p>
<p>任陸軍新聞組長，公然發表談話，謂世界形勢，如無劇烈之變化，則欲中國抵抗力之完全崩潰，希望甚微。馬淵上校並肯切的警吿日本人民，對於三强軸心，不可樂觀，因國際趨勢，不但無利於日本，目反有利於重慶」，素以直言者稱之馬淵上校。復謂，現在中國事件，複雜已極，非僅以常識可以了解。日本現與蔣介石之軍隊作戰，即使將之擊敗，亦不能解決中日之戰爭。現集於蔣氏幟下之大多數人士，實爲中國熱心愛國之優秀份子，其後盾則爲英美及其他國家，皆欲維持東亞之原有秩序者，日本應充分認叫反日陣營在重慶之努力」。</p>
<p>自一四九三年天主敎敎王擬將歐洲以外之世界，瓜分與西班牙，葡萄牙以來，最近軸心國家所訂劃分勢力範圍之協的，可訓野心最大，及瓜分世界最完整之企圖，日本應分之贓，其極車要之區域，即中國及南太平洋，句括安南，馬來，荷屬出印度羣島，暹羅，緬甸，印度或連澳洲與紐西蘭在內；尙有其他富饒之戰利品，均爲貪饞有所夢想不到。日本思併而得之，甚非易事，且須攻破新加坡之軍港，尤爲困難</p>
<p>新加坡現無英國主力艦隊之援助，欲僅恃澳洲及荷屬艦隊之力量抗衛，實非日本之敵手；蓋日本除全部海空外，尙有陸軍爲之協助也。或謂欲攻新加坡，自應計及美國可畏之艦隊，但在日人意中，以爲當其同盟國家大規模進擊英國本部直布羅陀及蘇彝士運河時，日本如同時進攻新加坡，則大西洋方面危機增加，美國或將置新加坡之命運於不顧，亦未可知。</p>
<p>日本艦隊及空軍之實力，雖所損甚微，但陸軍之實力，不能集中以援助其偉大之南進計劃。據中立國陸海軍專家估計，日軍在中國陣亡病死及因傷永遠失去戰鬥力者，的在一百萬人以上。此外，且有一百二十五萬人困陷中國，其在東三省防俄者，尙不在內。惟軍事專家之一般意見，謂酬報遞减之經濟定律，足使日人不能組織新部隊以從事新冒險。日人在此情形下之合理步驟，應爲撒退其在中國之大隊人馬與運輸艦。半年以來，中國迭接日本求和之商請，且其條件亦漸和緩，日人已知短期內欲消滅中國軍隊，毫無希望，但光陰易逝，其南進計劃，實不容再緩。然則何不與中國議和，俾能撤退其部隊，以從事於南太平洋之發展乎？如新加坡之冒險，幸而成功，則無限制之煤油，橡皮，錫，米，棉等資源在手，再割斷滇緬路，卽可從容圍困中國，故現在日本儘給中國以相當寬厚之和平條件，因新加坡陷落後，則一切與中國所訂之條約，當然失其效用也。</p>
<p>此等理論，極爲合理，惟其合理，故中國人亦極了解日本。大軍之撒退，固暫予我以喘息之機會，但新加坡之陷落，於中國固爲大不幸，而極不利於英國；甚且美國亦將感受同等不利。現在與日人言和，祇爲暫時之休戰，而利益則全在日本方面。中日衝突，旣爲世界全面鬥爭之一部份，故必俟全世界戰事解決，然後中國始能享受持久之和平。吾人仍須繼續作戰，不但須維持我軍原有之陣地，且須壓迫日軍，使其不能撤調軍隊，以圖南進。開戰以來，中國雖損失兵士二百餘萬人，但現在中國之堅强軍隊，尙有正規軍二百五十萬人，與無數之游擊隊，從各方面規察，其軍隊之組織力量與經騐，均遠較開戰之時爲優。日軍方面，則散佈地域旣廣，且師出無名，紀律散漫，士氣頹喪，故我國如採決然之攻勢，必可收鉅大之效果。</p>
<p>中國此次作戰，遇有兩大困難，即缺少財力與缺少飛機。財政問題，極易明瞭，作戰三年餘，破壊可觀，加以最富之工業區，或被佔領，或被毀滅，交通大半毀壊，尙須維持數百萬軍隊之運輸及給養。外匯上國幣價値，已落至戰前五分之一，國內物價，則漲至戰前之六倍，幸而英美兩國，在債款與信用力面，相機予中國以頗大之援助。最近有人自中國來，述及羅斯福總統貸與中國一萬萬借款之宣言，在中國確有　人之影響，誠如某時評家之所言，此宣言實予苦受壓迫之中國人以最後勝利之新保證。</p>
<p>飛機問題誠非容易解決，英美以及其他國家，亦均感飛機之缺乏，故此問題頗引起一般之注意，本人對之擬作較詳之討論。中國飛機數目，從未超過日本十分之一，力量雖然懸殊，幸我國地域廣大，各處散布無數之飛機塲，在內地作戰，可得忠誠鄉民之協助，加以我國空軍之敢死勇氣，三年以來，略能維持抵抗擊落之日機的倍於我所損失者。直至去年九月，情形一變，是時起，日人改用效率較高之飛機，於是　數量以外，其質量亦較我機爲優，我機昇空抵抗，益形困難矣。</p>
<p>世界人士對於英國城鎭受無區別之轟炸之慘况，亦多習見不怪，但英國人至少有高射砲，氣球網，驅遂機以拒之，且有轟炸機以資報復。在中國之今日，祗見日機悠然飛越城鎭，選擇目標，安然投彈，而無遭遇抵抗，或報復之危險，在一九三九年五月三日四日兩天，日機猛炸重慶平民，被炸被焚而死　者約一萬人，較六個月內猛炸倫敦死傷之總數，尙復過之。</p>
<p>民主國家之需要飛機情形，固屬困難，但中國對飛機供給之要求，仍有堅持之理由。我國在長期消耗戰中，殲滅日軍在一百萬人以上，且另牽制一百二十五萬之部隊，使其不能用以援助其盟邦德意兩國，是中國之作戰，在過去與將來，均有利於民主國家。且飛機分配，亦不可不權衡輕重，比較數量，在英倫之戰，所需飛機數量，當以千計，或竟以禹計。在中國有比較少數之飛機，即能則造奇跡，以勵民氣，並以之協助陸軍作戰。</p>
<p>日人舞文弄墨，殆鮮其儔，中日衝突死傷數百萬，在交戰中者又數百萬，而謂爲偶然事件，稱之爲「中國事變。」美國在此次世界大戰中，或可維持中立國地位，但不論美國人對吾人如何稱道，吾人今堅守美國太平洋之外壘，固自視爲美國之協的國也。自余來美，無論在何處，均感覺此邦人士對中國之深切的友誼，余以爲此不僅爲對被侵略犧牲者之同情，不僅爲對我國勇敢作戰之認識，余以爲史有深於此者，卽一種自然深切之感覺，覺得中國爲一可信任之偉大民族。此時止在作戰，使戰禍不致延及美國，此民族如能渡此難關，則將來必能與　國合作爲美國人之子　　，保持太平洋之安全，託上帝之佑，與君等之助，吾人必可如願以償。</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>飛鏢大王</h3>
<p>— 秀碧</p>
<p>雖　是寒冷的初春，但他們還是赤着膊。</p>
<p>他們一個是師傅，二個是徒弟，做師父的就是父親，做徒弟的就是兒子。</p>
<p>在上午和下午每天兩塲，他們就先在一片泥塲上，擺上了兩排十八般武器。</p>
<p>隨着，師父就把嘴尖了起來：「車！車！」</p>
<p>「看　拳頭，　拳頭，看！」人們就圍成了圈子。</p>
<p>師父開口了：</p>
<p>「各位朋友，今天來看些什麽，有的朋友說就是來看飛鏢大王仟雲彪的飛鏢，好的，好的！在下就是飛鏢大王仟雲彪，飛鏢大王仟雲彪就是在下這一副嘴臉，……</p>
<p>「今天帶得兩個小徒兒，來這表現家傳絕技，完全為的是濟貧扶　，公開展覽，不取分文，要拿列位　分錢，便是忘八烏龜。……」</p>
<p>那飛鏢大王便把兩手一擺，轉了一個身，說的話也跟着轉了一個彎：</p>
<p>「不過銅　雖則不要，却要請諸位幫幫小忙，推銷一些東西，什麽東西呢？」</p>
<p>「　不表明，還是請在下和兩位小徒先表現一套「貨色」給各位看看！」說後，轉向　角退去了。</p>
<p>那兩個赤膊的徒弟　聽到這話，就竄上塲來，打　了一塲，便各自選定了一個方位，手舉足舞，打起「架式」。</p>
<p>互相　打在對方的身上，「劈拍，劈拍」怪響亮地。</p>
<p>打過，又演了一塲真刀真槍的大戰。</p>
<p>在叫好的聲中，那個飛鏢大王於是走前了幾步，向觀眾彎了一彎腰。</p>
<p>「好啊！好啊！」他詼諧地學着羣眾的聲音喊着：「不過且慢，正戲還未開塲。」……</p>
<p>什麽戲呢？原來就是表演飛鏢。</p>
<p>一個徒弟蹲在地上，手裏握着一個銅　，這飛鏢大王，就在武器架上取下了一隻縏有長繩的鐵鏢。</p>
<p>「人　說我飛鏢大王，在下可有些不敢當。」把鏢繫在臂上，他向四週的觀眾打着幾個揖：「不過在下練習這一套飛鏢，却下了整整十多年的工夫。……飛鏢怎樣表演，第一是「掌中擊物」，第二是了，哦，且慢……</p>
<p>「慢着，今朝實　沒有　　一隻，肚皮裏太空了，上不了勁，怎樣好呢！」徒兒開始在　腔作　了。</p>
<p>「說得對，說得對。」師父也附和着：「還是先請到位幫幫忙吧！」於是他們便在武　架旁，拿出了一個黑包裹。打開了，裏面是充滿了黑黑的膏藥。</p>
<p>為師父的，先代這膏藥吹噓了一陣。</p>
<p>「今天，至少要買掉它五十多個。」</p>
<p>「四十個也吧！」那徒兒却加上了一句補充。</p>
<p>「二十個吧！」師父又自動地減少了二十個。</p>
<p>觀眾中間，立刻有了要買的人了，十分鐘之後，膏藥祗剩了五個了。</p>
<p>飛鏢就此開始表演。……</p>
<p>先是由那徒弟蹲在地上，手掌中放着銅元，一鏢飛去，銅元落地，手掌不傷，於是觀眾喊了一聲好。</p>
<p>其次，銅元放到了頭頂上，一鏢飛去，照樣地銅元落地，頭頂不傷，他們又聽到了一聲喊好。</p>
<p>最後，銅元移到了鼻樑上，鏢飛去，也照樣，獲得了喊采　。</p>
<p>可是還不希罕，飛鏢大王的絕技還有，那便是把繩不規則地圍縛在身上，打了結　他一個轉身，繩結自開，鏢飛了出去，也不偏不巧地打着了銅元，這一次的喊采聲是更甚於前了。</p>
<p>飛鏢大王於是滿臉含笑地向觀眾們誇着口：「不是誇口！我仟雲彪，十多年來天天這樣地飛着鏢，可從來沒有一次失過「風」，出過「亂子」，這都是我苦練出來的……。」</p>
<p>可是有一天，是那個大雪紛飛的前一天吧，氣候是特別的冷；飛鏢大王的赤膊的身子打着抖戰，又加以一天的餓肚子，鏢飛出去的時候，手一軟，偏巧正打中了徒兒的鼻樑。</p>
<p>那徒兒，當塲暈了過去，四週却　　了一陣狂笑，那陣狂笑刺　了這「大王」的心，他的臉　鐵青又灰白着。……</p>
<p>從那一天起，在那一塊空塲上，人們便找不到這飛鏢大王的蹤跡了。</p>
<h3>「道」</h3>
<p>— 淑英</p>
<p>莊子上載東郭子問莊子道：「所謂道，惡乎在？莊子曰：“無所不在……在瓦　　……在屎溺。”」可知莊子極有「先見之明」，千百年後的今天，真是「道在屎溺」了；豈但「在」，而且「溢」了！</p>
<p>若「盜亦有道」，若「道亦有盜」；若「以道為盜」，若「以盜為道」……然而儘管天下人「瞭如指掌」，却還是個「吾道不孤」！</p>
<p>道固多，盜道者更多。現在祇要捐上幾十石白米，在報紙上揚一揚「仁風」；或者在什麽「會」裏　弄一把交椅坐坐……那就是十足底「道表中人」，雖「被盜者」也免不了要滿口稱「道」！</p>
<p>「道在屎溺」……究竟：道乎？盜乎？抑盜道乎？</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>不等趙四說完，沈麻子早在鼻孔裏哼了一聲，翹起着右手的大姆指，連連冷笑道：</p>
<p>「老大哥，別拿這些大少爺來嚇人！袁七爺，他又不是吳老板的老子？你們唱戲，他能管得着嗎？他要是真歡喜養小旦的話，為什麽不把吳老板收到了家裏去？」</p>
<p>趙四也不料這個大流氓的話會說得這樣放肆，不由漲紅了臉，斜靠在秋海棠的床上，氣得連喊「這是什麽話？這是什麽話？」秋海棠自己也氣得都青了，可是他　在不敢得罪這　條地頭蛇。</p>
<p>「你這個人是說話，還是放屁？」趙玉崑輕輕地從櫈子上站起來，先把沈麻子從頭到脚的看了一眼。</p>
<p>沈麻子從檯上瀉了下來，身材足足比玉崑高了一尺。</p>
<p>「好小子！你是誰呀？」他戟着姆指，差不多直指到玉崑臉上問。</p>
<p>玉崑只把身子略略一側，便讓到了左邊去。</p>
<p>「你問老子嗎？我就叫趙玉崑。告訴你吧！姓沈的，你把人家請了來，賣座好不好，那是你自己的運氣，你跟人家乾　有什麽用啊！」</p>
<p>沈麻子倒不料這一個衣衫襤　，相貌委瑣的年輕人，就是天天在台上唱時遷，唱朱光祖，台下大受歡迎，出乎常例掛的第五牌的武丑趙玉崑，心裏原不想得罪他，可是當着秋海棠和趙四兩個人的面，却又不便自己軟下去，只得依舊青着臉，忿忿地說：</p>
<p>「賣座好不好當然靠運氣，可是他唱旦的臉子嫩，不肯唱玩笑戲，那還不是給人家養在家裏……。」　（四〇）</p>
<h3>窮人搶窮人</h3>
<p>— 郭文牆</p>
<p>阿毛狗的父親垂頭喪氣走回家中，左手拿着一只籃子，右手把拳頭緊緊地握着。他一口氣跑上樓梯，衝進了擱樓，弄得擱樓板吱吱地響了起來。他把籃子往牀上一擲，放大着喉嚨在說話，好像在嘶叫：</p>
<p>「媽的，真倒運，這是第三次了！」</p>
<p>阿毛狗和他的媽媽看見他回來，手裏拿着只空籃，以為是很快樂的一件事。籃子空着不就表示剛才拿出去的一籃子東西已經完全換了法幣回來了嗎？不過當他們聽見「媽的」兩個字，已經知道有些不好了，何况後面還有着「這是第三次了。」這一句真把阿毛狗將媽媽嚇了一大跳，她連忙把手中繍的泰興公司的小孩服裝放了下來，注意着牀上的籃子。</p>
<p>「怎麽了，這一回？」她向阿毛狗爸爸發問。</p>
<p>阿毛狗爸爸坐在牀上，氣得簡直透不過氣來。</p>
<p>「怎麽嗎，你看籃子好了！」阿毛狗爸爸說話的聲音是很重，擱樓裏也有了回聲。</p>
<p>「難道又給人家搶去了？」</p>
<p>阿毛狗在拾着牀上的花生糖，這些是從籃子裏滾出來的。阿毛狗數了一數，祇有九塊大的和其餘一些碎了的。</p>
<p>「又是那個死不掉的癟二，他從我背後竄了上來，一手提了籃子就跑，跑的時候就把花生糖往袋裏塞。」停了一會，阿毛狗爸爸在說。</p>
<p>「那末你為什麽不追他呢？真該死。」她又在問，說話的聲音也比以前高，顯然是在發怒了。</p>
<p>「追！你知道我沒有追他嗎？不然這只籃子也將給這個死鬼帶走了。」</p>
<p>阿毛狗的爸爸每天早上和中午的時刻他總是拿了一籃子的花生糖，有時也有些五香荳，站在學校區的地方，等着學生們的光臨的。不知怎的，這幾天很不利，連續了三天，每天拿出去賣的花生糖不是被搶光就是搶了一大半。</p>
<p>「聽說那面的癟三是有黨的這樣每天給他們搶去，我們又，怎樣活呢？換一個地方去賣吧。」阿毛狗的媽在嗚咽了</p>
<p>這時，阿毛狗把眼淚用袖子管揩乾了，他看了看爸爸，又看了看媽媽，慢吞吞地說：</p>
<p>「媽，他們沒有飯吃，我們也常常餓着肚子，他們為什麽要來搶我們的呢？上海有錢的人很多，他們為……窮人搶窮人？……」</p>
<p>奇怪，爸爸聽見了阿毛狗的話，眼睛頓時也紅了起來。</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>路明的戀愛</h3>
<p>— 守蕪</p>
<p>被稱爲「影迷大情人」的路明，自從去港之後，久矣乎不聞她的消息了，直待不久之前，方有人傳說她之秘密來滬，加入藝華拍戲，但這祇是反映渴望之殷的空巾樓閣而巳，實際上完全是「空氣」。</p>
<p>較這「秘密來滬拍戲」之說早一些時候，還有一則關於路明的消息，那是說她在香港已和南洋公司的小生張活游因拍「閨怨」而假戲眞做，兩人時常出去遊玩，頗形親熱云云。</p>
<p>這消息，看起來是像煞有介事的，以常情推測，「誰個少女不善懷春」，路明到了現在的年齡，和一個靑年男子相戀，原也是人情之常。</p>
<p>然而常情也不是鐵律，路明最近給朋友的信中，便有關於這件事情的自白：</p>
<p>「進南洋後第一部戲是「閨怨」，男主角是張活游，在戲裏他的名字叫「占美」，拍過一個星期戲之後，忽然在公司的宣傳刊物「影地」上有一段這樣的驚人消息：路明張活游相戀，在拍影塲裏很親熱的叫他占美占美！內容便是說我們如何相戀，其實這是戲裏的事情，可惡的是他們不說明這是劇情，雖然大家都知道這祇是一篇宣傳稿，但是有一部人却以爲是事實。……過了不久我又看見上海的刊物上也有類似的消息，不過已經改頭換面了，非但說我們相戀，而且說我們時常在一起玩，唉，這眞是寃枉我，……」</p>
<p>電影明星是個「人」，戀愛原是無足怪的，但一般人對電影明星的戀愛問題，却總是特別感到興趣似的，那麼，路明對於這次「戀愛事件」的自白，想來也一定有人感到興趣的吧？</p>
<h3>好萊塢明星們拍戲時的怪癖</h3>
<p>— 惠霖</p>
<p>奧麗薇哈佛蘭在開麥拉之前，不大喜用胭脂塗在臉上和嘴脣上，尤其是和埃洛菲林合作的片子中；她開拍的前一天總是靜坐在家裏，但不一定是在讀劇本。</p>
<p>米蓋羅納常是從廠門口一縱一跳地奔進攝影塲裏去，身旁老是帶着一隻全身烏黑的小維狗；說也奇怪，凡是米蓋去拍任何戲的時候，這隻狗總是隨身帶着，假使沒有狗的話那末米蓋的戲會做不好，因爲他心裏正老是想念牠。</p>
<p>亨利方達在正式上鏡頭的前數小時內，雖然已經在化裝室裏，還是自說自話地背誦對白，並且大做其手勢，情形非常逼眞；化裝室裏會胡調的人常同他配演起來，但是亨利仍舊假戲眞做下去，旁人倒給他弄得不好意思呢。</p>
<p>嚼巧克力花生糖是蓓蒂黛維絲拍戲時候的脾氣，她常帶了一盒糖到攝影塲去；同時公司裏也有幾盒糖藏着，原來是影迷們特地送來給蓓蒂的，她就放在公司裏，預備拍戲時拿來吃。</p>
<p>安娜蓓拉最恨逢到星期五上午去拍戲，因爲她認爲禮拜五上午是最不吉利的時候；她又歡喜在化裝室裏哼些歌曲替化裝的工作人員開開玩笑。安娜本是法國人，現在是泰羅鮑華的太太，她有許多習慣，帶着道地的巴黎風味。</p>
<p>史賓塞屈賽和喬治勃倫兩人都有一種很好的脾氣，便是在拍戲的時候態度很嚴肅，本正經地直到攝完畢。</p>
<p>賈萊古柏是最怕羞的明星，他最恨人家去參觀他拍做戲，假使萬不得巳的時候，那末他也只得裝出一副會交際的非常客氣的招待手段，倒使來賓侷促不安。</p>
<h3>泰羅鮑華德風流史　四年間愛過八位女人</h3>
<p>— 淸暉</p>
<p>在好萊塢，誰也不能吾認泰羅鮑華是一位風流瀟灑，少年英俊的美男子；他十歲時，就開始在脂粉羣中厮混踏進銀壇以後，在短短的四年間，先後愛過八位女星；雖然他現在已和安娜蓓拉結婚，可是他過去的生活，實在可說浪漫得很，現且把他的風流賬說一說：</p>
<p>泰羅二十二歲上銀幕，初在法國女星茜蒙茜蒙的「綠窗春困」中當配角，茜蒙很喜歡他，泰羅那時地位低微，樂得與較有名氣的女星週旋，所以時常陪茜蒙游玩，攝影，游泳；不久他倆發生愛情。接着，他連續和洛麗泰楊合演三部片子兩人，友誼甚佳，常有的會，看來像很親密，人家都說他倆是一對已成熟的情侶，但洛麗泰楊却向新聞記者宣稱，他只是她至好的朋友而已，在於結婚，那還談不到。</p>
<p>這時候，宋雅海妮開始在好萊塢出名了，泰羅和她合潢一片，不料在影片的攝製的過程中，他倆同時陷入情網；這一次是公開的戀愛，舞塲，餐館，溜冰塲，到處都可看到他倆的足跡。外間一度傳聞泰羅曾和宋雅求婚，但這是沒有證實的消息。後來宋雅到美國各地作溜冰表演，和泰羅分別時，倆人曾在公衆之前，作熱烈的接吻。可是不久消息由好萊塢傳來，泰羅非但已把她忘懷，且在熱戀着珍妮蓋諾。</p>
<p>泰羅同珍妮的戀愛史比較長久，好萊塢每有宴會，他倆都聯袂與席，每星期日舞塲裏常見到他倆儷影雙雙。但當新聞記者問他幾時和珍妮結婚，他總以事業關係作答。後來不知因何緣故，他倆竟起口角，雖經友人調解，但愛情的裂痕，已無法彌補了。珍妮有愛她的人，而泰羅也開始追求福斯新人亞玲蕙蘭；不過他終因亞玲和李却格林過從甚密，而他也是李却的好友，不願奪人之美，遂放棄追求亞玲的野心。</p>
<p>後來，他被米高梅借去在「絕代艷后」裏充男主角。這一角色的人選，本來李思廉霍華呼聲最高，但是出乎意外，瑙瑪希拉竟堅持要泰羅合演，可見瑙瑪對於泰羅也有好感；在該片幾幕熱情鏡頭中，可以看出她的情感。也許是年歲相差之故，泰羅說在他倆中間，希望沒有戀愛事情發生。因此他倆的關係，也隨着「絕代艷后」攝完而斷絕了。</p>
<p>離開了瑙瑪希拉之後，泰羅開始和新星溫黛芭莉相戀，但爲期甚短。過後他一生最重要而最可紀念的事惰來了，原來泰羅見到安娜蓓拉，便覺得這位法國女藝人活潑可愛；未幾在攝製「蘇彝士」一片時，他的生活歷史開始轉變，他知道已遇到他理想中的伴侶，同時安娜也愛上了他，於是他倆的愛情很快的得到了成功；公司方面雖屢次加以阻止，都歸無效，他倆終于在一九三九年五月二十五日結婚了。</p>

<h3>British and American Joint Warning to Japan to Curb Southward Invasion of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies; British Prime Minister Churchill's Meeting with Shigemitsu A Summary of Britain's Clear Position on the Far East</h3>
<p>London: It has been learned here today that the United States and Britain have warned Japan against advancing southward towards Singapore and the Dutch East Indies. The British government has presented diplomatic documents to the Japanese ambassador to Britain and instructed the British ambassador to Japan to do the same. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>London: Reuters' diplomatic correspondent learned last night from well-informed Japanese sources that the meeting between British Prime Minister Churchill and Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu yesterday was fruitful and should greatly help to dispel some misunderstandings between the two countries. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>London: Reliable sources believe that Prime Minister Churchill told Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu yesterday that Japan has no basis to suggest mediating the European war. It is said that Churchill told Shigemitsu that if the Japanese Foreign Minister considers suggesting mediation of the European war, Britain does not know what the basis of the suggestion is. It is known that Matsuoka's previous suggestion was conveyed to British Foreign Secretary Eden by Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, in his private capacity. Reliable sources also said that Churchill did not recognize the Japanese claim that Britain's actions in the Pacific were intended to encircle Japan. The British Prime Minister explained that Britain's precautionary measures in the Pacific were purely for self-defense. Authorities also issued a statement yesterday stating that Britain has a clear observation of the danger of Japan's southward advance. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Cabinet Information Bureau spokesman Ishii said in response to reporters' questions that the Japanese government is considering publishing the full text of Foreign Minister Matsuoka's memorandum to British Foreign Secretary Eden. He said that the content of Eden's meeting with Shigemitsu could not be published without Eden's consent. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>London: An authoritative source issued a statement here yesterday stating that Britain has expressed a clear position on the danger of Japan's advance into the South Pacific. This statement was issued while British Prime Minister Churchill was meeting with Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu. The two reviewed the various British-Japanese talks held in London and Tokyo. The statement stated that Britain's concern about Japan's southward advance has been explained in the talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu, and between British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Foreign Minister Matsuoka. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When Information Bureau spokesman Ishii met with foreign correspondents today, he was asked when Foreign Minister Matsuoka's telegram to Eden could be made public. Ishii replied that they are currently considering making the full text of the memorandum public. According to Matsuoka's statement to the House of Representatives yesterday, the memorandum concerned Eden's views on the South China Sea issue and the Tokyo conference to mediate the Thai-Vietnamese dispute, which the British referred to as containing Japan's offer to mediate the European war. Ishii also said that the content of Eden's talks with Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu in London could not be published without Eden's consent. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>London: This afternoon, Undersecretary Butler declared in the House of Commons that the Japanese Foreign Minister, in a recent document to Foreign Secretary Eden, first made a general description of the European war, and then stated that Japan was fully prepared to assume the role of mediator, or take any action, to restore peace and normal relations not only for Greater East Asia but also for any place in the world. The Japanese Foreign Minister also expressed in subsequent remarks (which he claimed were made after consultation with Germany) that his words should be regarded as an offer to mediate the European war. In conclusion, Prime Minister Churchill has told the Japanese Foreign Minister that in the principles we are now fighting for (which are unrelated to territorial, commercial, or material gains, but are sufficient to affect the future of mankind), there is no possibility of compromise. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Guo Hosts a Banquet in England for the Governor of Burma</h3>
<p>London: Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi hosted a banquet yesterday to bid farewell to the Governor of Burma, Sir Dorman-Smith, who is about to take office. Guests included Monttilly, Undersecretary of the Burma Affairs Department; Sternerdale Burleigh, Director of the Far East Division of the Foreign Office; Cyril Rogers; Guo Lianwen; Chen Weicheng, Counselor of the Embassy; Tan Baoshen, Consul General; and Li Deyao of the Bank of China. The Governor of Burma will depart for Burma soon. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Oceania Belongs to Asia Slogan, US State Department Refuses to Criticize</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently stated that the memorandum he sent to British Foreign Secretary Eden did not involve Germany, and that the so-called mediation was only a minor issue. Matsuoka also commented on Japanese-Soviet relations, advocated that Oceania is an ideal region for Asians, and said that French-Japanese economic negotiations are underway. Matsuoka repeatedly explained the report made by Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Ohashi (according to Ohashi, Matsuoka's note to Eden, the main part of which is we do not recognize Japan's intention to invade the South). However, Matsuoka also said that once the ideal becomes a reality, his memorandum to Eden may be regarded as a suggestion to mediate the European war. Matsuoka's statement was made in response to Fukuda's question in the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. Fukuda asked Matsuoka to clarify the misunderstandings caused by his memorandum. The Japanese Foreign Minister also said that the land has sufficient natural resources to provide for 600 to 800 million people in this Oceania, which is 1,200 miles from north to south and 1,000 miles from east to west. He believes that people have the natural right to migrate there. It is not easy to deal with practical politics based on idealistic claims, but he believes that Caucasians should cede Oceania to Asians. (United Press, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: The State Department yesterday refused to criticize the suggestion made by Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke that Caucasians should give the Pacific Ocean's Oceania to Asians. According to news from Tokyo, Matsuoka told the Lower House yesterday, "I fully advocate that Oceania, which is 1,200 miles from north to south and 1,000 miles from east to west, should be colonized by Asian people." Geographic experts believe that Matsuoka's slogan "Oceania belongs to Asians" includes British, American, and French territories, as well as Hawaii, Samoa, and New Zealand. Kin, the representative of Hawaii and a Pacific geography expert, told a United Press reporter, "Mr. Matsuoka includes even more territories than I know." (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>London: The Far East situation seems to be more complicated than before due to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's warning in the Diet yesterday that Caucasians should cede Oceania to Asians. Matsuoka's declaration has caused astonishment in London. People in London believe that this declaration is in stark contrast to the diplomatic atmosphere during the earlier talks between British Prime Minister Churchill and Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu. The talks between the British Prime Minister and the Japanese Ambassador were welcomed by British and Japanese people here, who believed that they were sufficient to clarify the current atmosphere, and the general public also believed that these talks might help to relax the situation in the Far East. It is said that Churchill told Shigemitsu that he personally always had a warm feeling for Japan, and recalled the era of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, especially how pleasant the relationship between Britain and Japan was during the Russo-Japanese War. He also said that in view of the previous relationship, it would be a great tragedy if Britain and Japan went to war. At that time, Shigemitsu also said that Japan had no intention of creating a third war dispute in the Pacific. Now, Matsuoka's declaration not only makes people have a new understanding of the meeting between the British Prime Minister and the Japanese Ambassador, but also makes Churchill's warning to Shigemitsu that if Japan insists on its southward advance policy, it will make the tense situation in the Far East even more dangerous, even more important. It is also said that Churchill once told Shigemitsu that although Britain has no intention of attacking Japan, it may be forced to take certain plans for Britain's safety. People here also said that the British Prime Minister also told the Japanese Ambassador that Britain's war aims have not changed since the time of former Prime Minister Chamberlain, that is, to be determined to free Europe from the threat of German aggression. The British Prime Minister's words should have left Shigemitsu with no doubt about Britain's purpose. It is generally expected that Churchill will make a complete statement on Britain's eastward policy to the House of Commons in the near future. It is also said that they also know that Churchill has notified the Japanese Ambassador that Japan has no reason to suggest mediating the European war. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Australian Minister to the United States Observes That the Far East Situation Has Recently Eased</p>
<p>Washington: Republican Congressman Tinkham of Massachusetts claims that he will introduce a bill to Congress to prevent any part of the American fleet from going to Singapore, because if the United States does so, it will be regarded as a hostile act by Japan. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: Australian Minister Keiser told people after a meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Welles yesterday that the Far East situation seemed to have eased in the past four or five days, but the basic situation had not changed. When asked what facts this observation was based on, Keiser said that he could not list any special changes, but he felt that the tension had eased. (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: Public opinion here believes that whether a war will occur in the Pacific is still uncertain, and the chances of peace and war are equal. The United States has recently become deeply aware of the important relationship between Singapore and the United States. If Singapore falls into the hands of the Japanese, the supply of American rubber, tin, and tungsten will be interrupted, and American security will be further threatened. Does Tokyo also know the importance the United States attaches to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, or does it still expect that the American fleet will not dare to leave Hawaii under any circumstances? The key to the situation lies in this. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka was slightly embarrassed because he was criticized by Germany for suggesting mediating the European war. From this, it can be seen that Japan's move was not in accordance with Germany's plans, and the theory that Japan's policy is still opportunistic and not part of the Axis' plan is becoming more and more convincing. Those who will bear the brunt of the war in Japan's southward advance are its navy, but recent publications are all from people in the army, and the navy is silent. This is also regarded as a significant matter by people here. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The "Chugai Commercial Newspaper" published today that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the United States has been not only unfriendly to Japan. The newspaper declared that the establishment of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" does not mean conquest or oppression. It also said that Japan's southward policy is only a natural economic development. "We do not understand why the United States is blocking Japan's path, because this fact has nothing to do with the United States. Since Japan's just demands have been interfered with, it cannot remain silent forever, and the Japanese people will never succumb to unfair actions, no matter how terrible the consequences." (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Sydney: Australian Acting Prime Minister Fadden declared that the Australian government has formally invited Willkie, the former Republican presidential candidate who is visiting Britain, to visit Australia. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Thai-Vietnamese Peace Negotiations Still Underway in Tokyo, Ceasefire Agreement Extended Again, Various Obstacles Still Need to Be Overcome</h3>
<p>Vichy: The validity period of the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire agreement, which was previously extended once for fifteen days, will expire tomorrow. Japan, in its capacity as mediator, requested a second extension of ten days, which was immediately accepted by France and Thailand. This news has now been confirmed. The negotiations being conducted by the representatives of France, Thailand, and Japan in Tokyo have not been interrupted. There has been no word here of rumors that Vietnam has taken various military preparations, but it is believed that it is possible for the Vietnamese authorities to take preventive measures before the ceasefire agreement expires, because there is a possibility that the war may break out again. Responsible persons said that although there are various obstacles to be overcome in the Tokyo negotiations, it is a good sign that both sides can continue to exchange views. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Japan Claims Dispute Can Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>Tokyo Cabinet Information Bureau representative spokesman Ishii said today that the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, which is being mediated in Tokyo, will be resolved soon, declaring that the Thai-Vietnamese ceasefire has been extended for ten days, "because the resolution is near," and said that the negotiations are proceeding in a friendly manner. Ishii told foreign reporters at a press conference on Monday, "We expect to end this peace conference today, but the border issue is extremely complicated, so the French-Thai ceasefire has been extended for ten days." (United Press, 25th)</p>
<p>London: Radio Paris claimed that the Vietnamese military authorities have revoked all furloughs for officers and soldiers, and the French Far East fleet is currently cruising in the Gulf of Siam. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Gradual Easing of the Pacific Situation</h3>
<p>No matter from what angle we explore, what Japan's government and people have shown in the past ten days or so indicates that it does not seem to have the determination and preparation to immediately provoke a major war with Britain and the United States. Under the declaration and action preparations of Britain and the United States to resolutely fight, the Japanese side has clearly presented the greatest fluster and anxiety in many years. The fundamental crisis in the Pacific has not only not passed, but is brewing in a more profound place, but just thinking about the evolution of the outbreak of war, one cannot help but feel that the recent situation has eased slightly, and it seems that it can be temporarily delayed for a while. These days, in addition to changing its policy and concentrating all its efforts to explain and express its "peaceful intentions" to Britain and the United States, its arguments on the basic strategy of resisting Britain and the United States are: in case Britain and the United States attack, Japan has sufficient preparation, etc. Of course, Britain and the United States will not immediately launch an attack on Japan first, so this is a redundant statement!</p>
<p>One of the things that Britain and the United States were originally worried about was the pressure that the German-Italian Axis exerted on Japan, forcing it to respond to future German-Italian offensives and take action in the East. Under the current international situation, it is indeed difficult to imagine how Japan can resist such pressure head-on. The other day, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka expressed Japan's willingness to mediate a ceasefire in Europe, which is likely to be a reaction to German-Italian pressure. After this news came out, German officials immediately expressed dissatisfaction, saying that they did not participate in this proposal beforehand, and believed that emphasizing peace was a sign of weakness, and Germany was not weak, so there was no need to hope for peace. However, in addition to not formally responding to Japan's proposal, Britain, in order to win international favorable air, stated that even if Germany had not participated beforehand, Japan was Germany's ally; none of Britain's allied countries had shown such weakness. It is said that Germany was very angry with Japan because of this, and the ambassador to Japan formally questioned the Japanese side, and the Japanese authorities had to disclaim it and blame it on British propaganda and misrepresentation. As to what the truth of this scene is, we will wait for future diplomatic history to answer; but what is worth speculating on at present has two sides: on the one hand, Japan's final hurried denial shows the situation that it cannot resist German-Italian pressure; on the other hand, on the issue of the Pacific War, which is related to its own survival, at least for the time being, it has not listened to the German-Italian intention to make a desperate gamble, and is using various methods of evasion. In the short term, the final between the forces of enticement and evasion between Germany, Italy and Japan is one of the keys to the Pacific issue; before this point is concluded, the big one can still be temporarily safe.</p>
<p>More than ten days ago, another issue that made Britain and the United States very worried was the possible reaction of the Japanese side to the various active measures taken by Britain and the United States in the Far East recently. On the one hand, the procedures for the passage of the "American Lend-Lease Act" are about to be completed, and at the same time, the encircling situation of Britain and the United States against Japan in the Far East is gradually increasing, and the encirclement is gradually shrinking. If this continues, the possibility of realizing Japan's "Greater East Asia New Order" dream is indeed decreasing day by day. Then, perhaps Japan, which has always been known for its seppuku spirit, may disregard success or failure and resist this practical blow with heroic actions. For example, Japan suddenly invaded Thailand, impacting and cutting off China's southwestern route to the outside world, making it impossible for large-scale American aid to reach China in the future; this is not an unexpected action. For example, Japan has repeatedly stated that it will not hesitate to use force to oppose the United States' fortification of Guam when necessary; now the United States has finally disregarded everything and resolutely passed a bill to fortify Guam, which is only 1,500 miles away from Japan's mainland. Then, Japan may be forced to immediately make a serious protest to the United States. Once the United States ignores it, it may immediately recklessly use force. Any one of these kinds of problems has the full potential to cause a Pacific war. However, the facts in the past ten days or so do not show such a tense and bad situation. In addition to not giving any hint of effective countermeasures to the tough steps of Britain and the United States, Japan also revealed very deep fears in its efforts to explain to Britain and the United States. This fear is obviously not limited to a few government authorities, but is indeed widespread to all levels of its people. This can be proved from its recent parliamentary debates or the statements of major newspapers. In his note to Eden, Matsuoka is said to have asked Britain and the United States not to excessively stimulate the emotions of the Japanese people, so as not to rush to extremes, making it impossible for the authorities to restrain them and causing the outbreak of war; however, what has been continuously placed in front of everyone recently is the concern, requests and suggestions of the entire Japanese country for the government authorities to ease relations with Britain and the United States. Therefore, if they still feel that their government's actions are not enough, it must only be on the side of attempting to ease, and absolutely not in resenting the government's lack of initiative and toughness. The radical faction of the Japanese navy once emphasized that "the United States is not to be feared" and severely criticized the so-called "Americanphobia" among a part of the Japanese people, but recently, when faced with the major decision of the US-Japanese war, even these radicals themselves no longer make rash statements; and Admiral Nomura of the navy is a very important figure in the effort to ease relations with the United States. So, why is the tendency so relaxed? Undoubtedly, because the attitude of Britain and the United States is tough, and they have expressed their absolute refusal to compromise with actions!</p>

<h3>China's Air Force Strength to Be Greatly Increased, Urgent Need for Full Assistance from Friendly Countries, Sino-Soviet Transportation Extremely Smooth</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Xinshu Daily published today that its reporter interviewed Mao Bangchu, Commander-in-Chief of the Chinese Air Force. According to Mao, if the assistance of the United States is obtained, the generals of the Chinese Air Force will revive their heroic spirit and participate in the general counterattack of the Chinese army to defeat the Japanese army. China needs the assistance of friendly countries to rebuild its air force. The assistance we need is multi-faceted, so we need not only the assistance of one friendly country. American public opinion is gradually tending to implement economic and military sanctions against Japan. Mao recently returned to China from the United States. Mao also said that if China can form an alliance with the friendly country of the United States, there is an opportunity to defeat the Japanese immediately, so we should not miss this good opportunity. China's air force will soon increase its strength and participate in the counterattack of the Chinese army. The Japanese are of course jealous of our process of building the air force and want to destroy it, but our efforts do not slacken at all. The strengthening of the Chinese Air Force is an unprecedented force. It is only a matter of time before we show our bravery to the Japanese army. I believe that although the Japanese are committed to advancing southward, they still cannot forget our rear, so the Chinese Air Force is always preparing to cope with the new challenges in this year's bombing season. At present, the assistance of various friendly countries is coming from all sources, and the transport between China and Korea is smooth. We are now training young aviators, and soon there will be air forces all over China. (United Press, 25th)</p>

All of this demonstrated that those in charge of grain administration in various provinces had made their utmost efforts, which was commendable and gratifying. In the future, they should follow the instructions of Chairman Chiang and Vice-President Kong, as well as the guidance of the heads of various central ministries, to formulate a comprehensive implementation plan that would be adapted to the conditions of each province and region.

<h3>Tanaka Reports on the Invasion of China</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Lieutenant General Tanaka, Director of the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, told the Diet yesterday that the Japanese army currently occupies the best parts of China, namely North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Therefore, resolving the war with China does not require military force. Today, we should focus on economic development in the occupied areas. If this development can be implemented, the interests of both Chinese and Japanese people in these areas will increase, creating a close economic link, which in turn can enhance political relations between the two sides. Tanaka said in response to questions at the House of Representatives Deficit Bond Committee that the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China is currently pursuing a policy of "peace and order first." In this policy, the Japanese army will focus on building railways and barracks, citing "Manchukuo" as an example. Japan began a major program of building barracks in "Manchukuo" in 1935, which is clear evidence of the long-term presence of the Japanese army and has led to significant progress in peace and order. The same effect is gradually being achieved in Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, and the Shanghai area. Tanaka also spoke about the overall economic situation, saying that Yangzhuang (transliteration) in Shanxi has already produced 300 million tons of anthracite coal. One kilogram of this coal can fuel a truck equipped with a gas generator to travel 59 kilometers. Some people naturally say that we cannot drive cars without oil, but with a little effort, we can obtain the necessary fuel for driving Japanese cars in North China. The fact that the public buses in Tokyo are now using coal from Yangzhuang is proof of this. Tanaka also mentioned the production of iron, saying that the iron factory built by Yan Xishan has been improved by the Japanese and can now produce 60,000 to 70,000 tons of cast iron annually, meeting the entire demand of North China. Tanaka suggested developing the resources of Shanxi to meet the needs of North China. In this way, the raw materials obtained in the Tianjin area can be transported to Japan to alleviate Japan's shortage of materials. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Adopts a Policy of Non-Interference in Balkan Affairs to Avoid Military Conflict with Germany. US Holds Important Talks with Turkey and Greece.</h3>
<p>Sofia - Reliable sources indicate that the Soviet government has hinted to the governments of the Balkan countries that the Soviet Union has decided not to interfere in any events in the Balkan countries in order to avoid military conflict with Germany. This notification was not made through official documents, notes, or formal meetings, but was still communicated through diplomatic channels. (25th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Sources here recently acknowledged the importance of the talks between the British Prime Minister and the Turkish Ambassador to the UK, Aras, and the Greek Minister to the UK, Simopoulos. Once Bulgaria is occupied, it is feared that the Allied countries may take countermeasures. Although the nature of the talks is not known to outsiders, a well-informed "Times" diplomatic correspondent asserted that the policies adopted by Britain, Greece, and Turkey once Bulgaria is occupied have become very clear. There may still be many policies that cannot be made public for the time being. The correspondent also stated that since the last European war, if Britain has not allowed Bulgaria to be used by Germany as a base for aggression against Britain and the Allied countries, Britain should respect Bulgaria's neutrality. It is expected that Churchill has already told Aras that he firmly believes that Turkey will fulfill its obligations to the Allied countries. (26th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ankara - The famous Turkish newspaper "Ateş" stated that the remarks made by Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu on Sunday clearly indicate that the establishment of the Turkish-Bulgarian Friendship Treaty has not changed Turkish foreign policy in any way. Because overseas critics have distorted the interpretation of this agreement, it is necessary to make a statement. These critics have ignored the needs of Turkish national defense and internal security and have failed to note that Bulgaria is independent and the master of its own territory and rights. The newspaper finally stressed that both sides declared in the agreement that they would not commit aggression against third parties, would be loyal to their obligations, would not commit aggression against each other or against third parties, would not incite or support attacks against third parties, and were determined not to commit unilateral aggression against third parties. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Vichy - Diplomatic circles here have recently stated that there are various factors to prove that all Balkan countries are willing to stay out of the European war. For example, Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu repeatedly stated that the Turkish-Bulgarian non-aggression pact does not affect the existing treaty obligations undertaken by the country, and expressed his willingness to sign similar agreements with other countries. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Markovic's visit to Budapest proves that all countries in the Balkans are willing to reaffirm their desire for peace. The Balkan Peninsula has always been known as the gunpowder keg of Europe. A small spark is enough to start a prairie fire. Now that the countries concerned have made the above-mentioned expressions, it is worthy of attention. (24th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sofia Feels Uneasy on the Eve of the German Invasion of Bulgaria</p>
<p>Southern Capital City - Today, news received here states that Bulgaria experienced its first blackout last night. At the same time, the government is implementing the most stringent inspections of news, mail, and telephones. King Boris of Bulgaria has met with a delegation of 25 opposition leaders who want to ask the King to try to avoid war. However, it is claimed that only the leaders of the "loyal" opposition party were received, while pro-German elements and communists were rejected. News from Sofia today reports rumors that several German military detachments have crossed the Danube River from Romania into Bulgaria, but officials do not believe these rumors. Eight leaders of the Bulgarian Radical Farmers' Party, including former cabinet member Velchev, were banned for "endangering public order," which shows the tension inside Bulgaria. Knowledgeable sources here predict that Hitler will gradually infiltrate Bulgaria, rather than wanting to flow into Bulgaria suddenly. Many believe that several detachments of German technical troops are now quietly occupying key points in Bulgaria, especially airports, which is important. Therefore, Germany does not need to challenge Bulgaria's sovereignty to achieve the goal of controlling the center of Bulgaria. It is alleged that the same strategy has already been applied to Romania. Knowledgeable people insist that the German army will postpone going to the Greek border because the German side still believes that a solution to the Italo-Greek war may be possible. According to political observers, the implementation of blackouts throughout Bulgaria last night reflects that Germany's correct intentions have not yet been decided.

<h3>British Troop Landing Proposal Rejected by Greece. Heavy Rain and Fog in Albania, Only Localized Fighting.</h3>
<p>London - According to news here today, the proposal from London for British troops to immediately land in Thessaloniki has been rejected by Greece. According to diplomatic circles here, Greek Minister to the UK Simopoulos told British Prime Minister Churchill that the Greek government does not want British troops to land unless or until German troops actually invade Greece. It is understood that British military experts advocate immediately sending an expeditionary force to land in Greece, believing that if British troops wait for German troops to invade Greece, then they will not be able to launch it. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - The Athens Radio Station said last night that the fighting between the Greek army against the Italian army in Albania has been restricted due to heavy rain and fog. The Greek army cleared out the remnants of the enemy in the large mountain ridges and Kunyun areas recently seized, and as a result, captured a large number of Italian soldiers and obtained a lot of military equipment and war tools. The Greek army's patrol activities are also quite successful. In a certain local battle, the Greek army completely defeated the Italian army and destroyed two enemy planes. Three more Italian planes were shot down, and two were seriously damaged. According to a Reuters correspondent from the Albanian border, British planes have been continuously bombing the Italian army positions in the Shugbi River valley, Erba Jieyilin, and Pogradetz areas since 3:00 AM yesterday morning. The Italian army in the area was reinforced last week. The artillery units in the South Taifuri River and Fuyu Xia River valleys intensely bombarded each other. There were local battles in several places. Italian infantry attacks were severely damaged and retreated. The Greek army has seized an important high ground in the Osteravica ​​Mountain that controls the Italian army's vanguard position. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

However, these destroyers have not had the opportunity to clash with enemy ships that our submarines have already obtained.

<h3>Britain Invents New Method to Deal with German Submarine Warfare. Germany Claims to Have Destroyed Over 210,000 Tons of British Ships. London Officials Denounce as False Propaganda.</h3>
<p>London - According to news today, Hitler threatened with an "unimaginable" submarine blitzkrieg, but the British Navy's response to this threat is to use the latest invention of secret methods to capture and destroy submarines. When the submarine war intensifies in the spring, British destroyers, mine-hunting ships, etc. will not only prevent submarines, but will also implement a more effective offensive war. This offensive war is unprecedented since the failure of France. The British Navy's anti-submarine strategy is the most secretive in the war, but naval research experts have spent months inventing new methods to replace or enhance the outdated methods of searching for submarines. New methods will soon be used to greatly enhance the effectiveness of the navy's anti-submarine patrols and restore the situation in the first few months of the war, when ship losses were minimal and submarines that launched attacks were destroyed every day. In the second half of 1940, British ship losses increased. Officials did not explain the reason, but it may be due to the occupation of France, and Germany's acquisition of part of the French fleet. Diplomatic observers speculated that because of the close Anglo-French coordination, the United Kingdom transferred important secrets of submarine prevention equipment to France. The basic principles of the British method have obviously been verified by the German side on French ships, so the German side has learned detailed information about the United Kingdom's new equipment and its application methods, so the submarine commander has become more cautious to prevent being captured. (25th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - Responsible sources here claim that Hitler's claim in his speech yesterday afternoon that the German side had sunk enemy ships totaling more than 200,000 tons is a fantasy far from the truth, as evidenced by previous claims by the German side. For example, in the British convoy attack in the Gulf of Gavres, the German side claimed to have sunk the entire convoy of 86,000 tons. In fact, 33 of the 38 ships in the convoy safely arrived in port. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - The German communique of February 14 claimed that a certain German attack ship had sunk 14 ships in a convoy, totaling 82,000 tons, which has been proven to be false by the Admiralty's announcement. According to reports, the total loss of merchant ships in the week ending February 16 was 12 ships, totaling 37,636 tons, of which 11 belonged to British ships, and only one belonged to Allied ships. The announcement also said that Hitler's speech said that the German side had sunk ships totaling 215,000 tons in the past few days, which was not the case. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - This morning, the German official document stated that Hitler declared in his speech in Munich yesterday that in the past two days, the German side had sunk enemy cargo ships totaling 215,000 tons.

<h3>German Planes Attack British Convoy in the Eastern Mediterranean. Heavy Damage to a Giant Ship Unconfirmed.</h3>
<p>London - Yesterday, the Italian military headquarters communique stated that a German air force team attacked a British fleet in the eastern Mediterranean. A giant British ship was hit and damaged, and was almost sunk. This statement has not been confirmed in London. According to a Reuters correspondent in the British fleet in the Mediterranean, a part of the British fleet continues to maintain traffic along the Libyan coast, while the main fleet cruises in the central Mediterranean for four days, repelling German dive bombers and successfully protecting merchant ships traveling in convoys. German dive bombers flew from Italian bases, intending to sink the merchant fleet under the protection of the British fleet and attack the British fleet. However, the British side did not suffer any damage, and the German planes were driven back and damaged. There is an aircraft carrier in the British fleet, which can be a target for German planes, but German planes only dropped bombs on other ships, because they have not forgotten the heavy damage they suffered the last time they attacked the British aircraft carrier "Renown." In addition to safely escorting a large number of merchant ships, the British fleet also swept the sea according to plan and was not hindered by German dive bombers or the Italian fleet. The Italian fleet has not appeared so far. Although enemy planes have been watching all day, trying to follow the British fleet's actions, they immediately fled when they saw British fighter planes taking off from the aircraft carrier. Finally, a team of Ockel or bombers was overtaken by British planes. The German planes then threw bombs into the sea, intending to increase their speed in order to escape, but it was ineffective. As a result, one German plane caught fire and crashed into the sea. At dusk, another team of German planes came out of the clouds, but they also failed to launch an attack.

<h3>Hitler's Full Speech on the Anniversary of the Founding of the Nazi Party, Vowing to Launch a Naval Offensive Against Britain and Considering 1941 as the Year of Victory</h3>
<p>Munich - German Führer Adolf Hitler, amidst the cheers of veteran party members, entered the historically significant and renowned beer hall at 5:05 PM last night. Munich "District" Leader Wagner stepped forward to greet him, assuring the Führer of Germany's faith in and love for him, stating, "The Führer is leading Germany in the most magnificent war in history. Führer Hitler will surely achieve victory, and the plutocratic politics of Britain will inevitably perish." Hitler then delivered a speech, recounting the founding of the Nazi Party twenty-one years ago, stating:</p>
<p>The Nazi Movement's History</p>
<p>The Nazi Party's struggle has lasted twenty-one years, and it is rare in history to still be able to speak with you all here. It is also unprecedented for someone to continue to fight unyieldingly for their ideals and doctrines of twenty-one years ago and to have put them into practice. From the beginning of our party's organization, we have always put the interests of the entire German nation first. This proposition has been consistently upheld and has never changed. The reasons for Germany's defeat in World War I and the oppression of the Treaty of Versailles were due to political errors that were sown before the war, not after. The political leaders at the time did not take appropriate measures in domestic and foreign affairs. However, one point cannot be blamed on the political leaders of the time: they did not really need war; if they had needed war, they would have been fully prepared, and the result would not have been defeat. Although military errors were also committed, German soldiers persevered with the enemy for four years, which was admired by the world. From this, it can be seen that Germany's defeat was not due to poor frontline combat but to domestic corruption. At that time, there were two conflicting political ideals in Germany: nationalism and socialism. The impact of this was to cause the country to fall apart. After the Nazi movement rose up, I deeply knew that even if it won the support of the entire nation, it would not be able to improve Germany's domestic and foreign affairs. Therefore, the Nazi movement strived towards this goal.</p>
<p>Breaking Free from the Shackles of the Treaty</p>
<p>The external oppression we suffered at that time was the Treaty of Versailles. At that time, I gave my first speech here, urging the people of the whole country to recover from the great humiliation that Germany had suffered. This treaty brought political and economic disaster to the German nation. Diplomatically, all of Germany's rights were deprived. The heavy reparations almost destroyed any hope of economic revival for the German nation. At that time, Germany faced economic difficulties, a sharp increase in unemployment, a rapid decline in living standards, a decrease in population, and the suffering of economic slavery. There was no greater suffering than this. This aroused the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working class, gradually arousing the sympathy of the world. However, the doctrine of the Nazi movement is "God helps those who help themselves." When we first launched the Nazi movement, we knew that the Treaty of Versailles could not be lifted by indecision. Only with strong national power could we break free from this shackle. Therefore, the Nazi movement worked hard to purge the political parties within the country and first sought to improve domestic affairs. These two major revolutions occurred in Europe: the Nazi and Fascist revolutions, both achieving the same results.</p>
<p>Germany and Italy Share Fortune and Misfortune</p>
<p>But the world initially did not pay attention, thinking that Germany's national power was weak, and its public opinion was not strong. It was impossible to form this social torrent. The Nazi and Fascist movements then moved forward together. The strength of their unity is beyond ordinary alliances. Our enemies at that time really could not understand that I had made a friend, and because we had the same enemies, we all held the sincerity of helping each other. Recently, Italy's assistance to us in the war, restraining Britain's land, sea, and air forces in Africa, is clear evidence of this.</p>
<p>Launching a Naval War Against Britain</p>
<p>I received a report from the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy two hours ago, stating that the activities of our country's submarines have recently sunk another 215,000 tons of enemy ships. From March to April, you will see more intense actions. The time will prove that we have been dormant due to the winter. Our dive bombers have now made it impossible for British ships in the North Sea and the Mediterranean to move freely. In short, wherever the footsteps of Britain reach, we will drive them away. Wherever British ships sail, our country's submarines will attack them. In the spring of 1941, Britain will attack the mainland. I am waiting for their attack. Britain has launched its offensive elsewhere, but wherever the enemy goes, we will come out to meet them and give them the most significant blow. Hitler then expressed his desire to negotiate and disarm, saying, "I am willing to follow the path of negotiation to solve everything. Negotiation can reduce bloodshed and complete what is desired. We are by no means ignorant. Things that can be resolved with justice can be resolved by force. However, Germany needs to survive, so it must obtain the conditions necessary for survival. Others have no reason to deprive us of the right to live. Countries that already have 38 million square kilometers of territory should not seize another 2.5 million square kilometers of land from another country. We can no longer tolerate the rule of other countries and listen to their economic policies that force us to follow." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Random Talks on the European War (30) (7) Bulgaria's Dilemma</h3>
<p>Strategically, Bulgaria's situation in 1941 is like that of the Netherlands and Belgium in 1940.</p>
<p>The German strategy is to defeat Britain, but Britain is visible but unreachable, so in May of last year, it attacked France via the Netherlands and Belgium, hoping to annihilate the main force of the Anglo-French Allied Forces. By this year, this main force has moved to the eastern Mediterranean line. For example, the Greek army has attacked Albania, and the British and Australian armies are making steady progress in Italian Libya in North Africa. Except for going through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, the German army has no other way to directly attack the British Empire. Yugoslavia and Bulgaria have changed places with the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>
<p>Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov went to Vienna and Berlin, ostensibly to visit famous doctors Aibinquan to treat stomach ulcers. His whereabouts became the target of news reporters for a while. Whether his trip had other purposes is unknown to outsiders. However, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a strange statement, saying that if German vehicles requested to pass through to Greece, Bulgaria would have no choice but to accept. At the same time, Berlin was also tight-lipped about the whereabouts of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop.</p>
<p>Filov stayed in Vienna for five days before returning home and immediately told reporters in secret, "The American side is rumored to have made a trip to Germany, which is completely untrue." But the day after he returned to Beijing, he hurried to Koriya, 43 miles away, to meet King Boris III and report on the treatment of his illness. The next day, his father and the king discussed everything again, and that night he hurried back to Beijing to convene an extraordinary cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Filov's busy schedule must have something more serious than his stomach ulcer. In other words, it is about Bulgaria allowing the German army to pass through to attack Greece. How Bulgaria decides is irrelevant. The German army can force its way through regardless of everything. However, it is a fact that cannot be ignored that it may affect the Soviet Union and Turkey.</p>
<p>Boris is an amiable king. Although he participated in several Balkan battles and the last World War, he is very willing to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. He often likes to travel incognito, repair machines, play with hunting dogs, and chat with farmers, making people believe that he does not regard himself as a noble. He once said, "If I lose the throne, I don't really care. If it comes true one day, I might as well go to the United States and become a mechanic."</p>
<p>Bulgaria is currently the focus of the situation, and Boris has become the center of pressure from all parties. He governs the Slavic people. Most of his bloodline comes from France. His relatives are all royal families in Britain, Belgium, Portugal, and Romania. Queen Ioanna is an Italian princess. He himself believes in the Greek Orthodox Church, and Tsar Nicholas II was originally his godfather. His father, King Ferdinand, has been in exile in Germany for twenty-two years.</p>
<p>In addition to these personal relationships, Bulgaria is the Soviet Union's closest ally in Europe and a necessary route for Germany to expand into the Near East. Recently, someone asked Boris what Bulgaria's foreign policy was. He replied, "My cabinet is pro-German, the Queen is pro-Italian, my people are pro-Soviet, and only I am neutral."</p>
<p>Boris's remarks are not an exaggeration. The Bulgarian nation's language, culture, customs, bloodline, and emotions are all close to the Soviet Union, but the cabinet ministers, especially Prime Minister Filov and Interior Minister Jabrovski, advocate following Germany's orders. The Queen naturally favors Italy, and only Boris, within the possible scope, insists that Bulgaria should be independent and autonomous by Bulgarians. But his claims are unlikely to be realized. Last November, after he returned from a visit to Berlin, German Air Force Minister Goering told Bulgarian visitors, "Your king is too conservative and neutral, and he is incompatible with us. Fortunately, there will be no more emperors in the new European situation."</p>

<h3>Hollywood Fox Basketball Team Only Wins by Five Points Against Shanghai Team, Combined Team Performs Well, Hollywood's Victory Not Easy</h3>
<p>The American Hollywood Twentieth Century Fox Company basketball team returned to the United States from the Philippines. It arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge yesterday afternoon. The Sports Department of the YMCA specially invited them to land and hold an exhibition match for observation. Huaxing and McLean officers formed a combined team to compete. It was held at the YMCA basketball court at 8:30 last night. The combined team performed very well. They took the lead all the way in the first half until they were chased out by Fox near the end of the first half. The first half ended with a score of 34 to 31, only losing by three points. In the second half, the Allied Forces twice chased out with a score of 37 to 36. As a result, the Shanghai Allied Forces only lost by five points with a score of 68 to 63. Fox's victory was very strenuous.</p>
<p>Defeated by Santo Tomas in the Philippines</p>
<p>The team of eight people arrived in Shanghai on the Coolidge yesterday afternoon and returned to the United States on the original ship at 10:00 this morning. The team was invited by the Philippine Sports Association and played a total of ten games in the Philippines, winning eight and losing two, losing to Santo Tomas University and Atotna team. Except for one or two people who are Fox company employees, the rest are all college players, funded by Fox to make a trip to the Far East, which is also called publicity.</p>
<p>Strength Not as Good as Last Year's Washington University</p>
<p>Based on yesterday's performance, the team is probably just a second-rate team in the United States. There is nothing particularly outstanding about them, and there are few new tactics. The whole game mostly uses the central turn to shoot and score. After being blown "more than three seconds" several times, Okejara changed to turning around and shooting around the basket. Because Li Zhenzhong could not guard him, he scored repeatedly. Okejara is the most dangerous person in the whole team, followed by Crowt. In terms of strength, it is far less than Washington University, which came to Shanghai last year, at least 30% worse. Last night, the ingenious smoke screen obstacle attack method was performed from the water.</p>
<p>Shanghai Team Takes the Lead Supernaturally</p>
<p>The Shanghai combined team first responded with Henry Sahwits, Li Zhenzhong, Mansi, Chen Xuesong, Bao Songyuan. The performance of Henry, Li, and Man is wonderful. The three are indispensable. Chen Xuesong is average. Bao Songyuan often likes to fight alone to score points. In the first half, the combined team had a great momentum and took the lead all the way. The visiting team could not think of any way. Li Zhenzhong set a national record, followed by Henry Sahwits, first scoring four to zero. Okejara scored two goals in a row. But Bao Songyuan and Chen Xuesong scored four points again. The Shanghai team took the lead by two points for a long time. At sixteen to ten, Ruchi entered the lane, Chen Xuesong, Mansi's wonderful shots, the Shanghai team once took the lead by six points with twenty-three to seventeen, twenty-nine to twenty-three. Okejara scored consecutively, and the visiting team chased to a tie of nineteen each, and thirty-one. The first half ended with thirty-four to thirty-one, taking the lead by three points.</p>
<p>Fouls Repeatedly, Four Players Fined</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, Mansi and Ruchi scored three points in a row, and it became a tie of thirty-four again, and then twenty-seven to thirty-six, which was the second time the Shanghai team exceeded. The Shanghai team seemed to be physically weak, and their stamina was not as good, and the situation gradually declined. At forty-one to forty-eight, Henry Sahwits was fined, forty-one to forty-nine, and the other party's Paul was fined. Henry exited, Chen Xuesong entered again, and Paul exited Xiang Shengjin. Since Paul exited, the Shanghai team took advantage of the situation and rushed to catch up to forty-seven to forty-nine, only two points behind. Unfortunately, they failed to enter again. Forty-eight to fifty-six, Li Zhenzhong was fined, and Ren Xiangcheng entered, forty-eight to fifty-nine, and Okejara, the main general of the visiting team, was also fined. In the second half, a total of four generals were fined. Jingins finally transferred Chen Xuesong, and the momentum was revived, scoring ten points in one breath. Unfortunately, the time had come, and the conclusion was sixty-eight to sixty-three, only five points behind.</p>
<p>The Visiting Team Gets 100 US Dollars</p>
<p>Last night, the upper and lower floors were full. One hundred and fifty ten-yuan tickets and four hundred seven-yuan tickets on the upper floor were sold out. A total of 4,300 yuan should be obtained. This game was introduced and negotiated by Asadurian and Safolis, the managers of the Huili Ball Arena. According to Bratot, the American team requested to divide 100 US dollars, and the remaining amount will be used as a charitable donation.</p>
<p>Last night's opening show, McLean vs. Little Bear, McLean took the lead with fifteen to ten in the first half, and Little Bear won with thirty-one to twenty-seven in the end.</p>

<h3>Grain is Not Handled for People's Food, Rice is Stored for Making a Fortune The Rice Was Not Sold the Day Before Yesterday, and Was Not Sold Yesterday. When Will You Be Willing to Sell? There are Many Goods, Many Stocks, and the Consignment Does Not Dislike Its Quantity</h3>
<p>Under the ambition of foreign rice dealers to fill their insatiable desires, the market has long been abnormal and cannot be balanced with the right reason of production, sales, and storage. Yesterday, the holder still refused to release samples, and the brokers did not come to the market to trade. The market is still in chaos and is secretly rising. Although Siam and Saigon had a small number of quotas to respond to, the broken rice Yinghua Company has still added one yuan. Foreign dollars, after the transfer of the hoarding households, saw a horizontal jump of one and a half yuan again, but most of them hope that the unexpected high price will come with the Pacific War. Therefore, the total transaction of spot goods is less than 1,000 bags, and the futures are less than 200 tons, but in fact, a part of the stored rice warehouse has reached 950,000 bags, and there are more than this number. There are more than 30,000 new arrivals. According to the order, Yu Long threw out 6,600 tons of Mindang in April yesterday, at a price of 100 yuan. However, the market does not go from the right reason, so the more stored goods and orders arrive, the more the market price rises. The general orderers think that the more goods hoarded, the more wealth will be after the soaring, the more the better, and it is not to handle rice for the ration of the general public. Therefore, the masses will be more and more bitter.</p>
<p>The national rice markets, such as thick and thin japonica, are still strong. The local shop has a strong stomach, but because the price of thick japonica is expensive, it is not as smooth as thin rice, so the result of thick japonica is only mediocre, similar to the previous one. Thin rice continued to increase by Yuan Xu, which is Qingjiao Hu Yuan, thin rice 103 yuan, 102 yuan and a half, Kunshan white japonica Hu Yuan special white 107 yuan and a half, second class 104 yuan, the original bag is lacking goods and no market, although the glutinous rice is difficult to be prosperous, but the cargo owner is not restricted, and the shouting price continues to rise. Therefore, once asked, the price will increase by one or two yuan. Hong Kong special Yuan opened 90 yuan, the second class 87 yuan and a half, glutinous rice seal 82 yuan.</p>

The market price is 40 yuan, and the market is quite strong.</p>

Most of the transactions are short selling and buying long. Once a loss occurs, disputes frequently arise. Several such incidents have already occurred. Therefore, the market authorities, in order to prepare for potential problems, have issued a public notice to the market, banning futures trading.

<p>The ribbed steel bar market seems to be in a state of hovering. The Northern Ocean and Yangtze River inland waterway merchants are experiencing sluggish sales. Furthermore, construction companies on this street have not seen a flourishing of construction projects. Therefore, the buying and selling of this commodity by construction companies has not been lively. The market situation remains bleak, causing standard selling prices to decline. Currently, fine sizes of 3/4 inch are priced at 2,050 yuan per ton, while coarser sizes of 5/8 inch and above are only selling for 2,000 yuan per ton.

The market is firm and not easily loosened.</p>
<h3>Economic Talk: Timepieces and Water Clocks (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>However, even for a family like the Ningguo Prefecture, only eighteen timepieces were found during the confiscation of their property later on. It is said that during the Jiaqing era, when Heshen's home was raided, ten large chiming clocks, one hundred and fifty-six small chiming clocks, three hundred table clocks, and eighty pocket watches were confiscated. Today, even a clock and watch shop may not have as many treasures as Heshen had in his home. In the past, the Qing Palace favored musical clocks, calling them alarm clocks. A Qing Palace poem describes them:</p>
<p>"Pearls serve as curtains, embroidered lotus flowers adorn,</p>
<p>When singing and dancing cease, one lazily stretches,</p>
<p>Awakening from dreams, one still suspects music plays,</p>
<p>A new-style musical alarm clock chimes."</p>
<p>How did the watch get its name? We must trace back to the old timepieces used in China, which consisted of a tall pole measuring eight feet, used to measure the shadow of the sun to determine the time. This is the method used by the Grand Minister of Education in the Zhou Dynasty, who used an earth sundial to determine the position of the sun and locate the center of the earth. When Western clocks and watches flowed in, China named the clocks that could chime on their own as "self-ringing clocks." Then, the ones that did not chime but could be carried in one's pocket were named "watches," using the name of the old Chinese sun-measuring device. Today, some people, because they are made of metal, add the "gold" radical to the left of the character for "watch," resulting in the character 錶, which misses the original intention of the name. However, most people still use the original character 表.</p>
<p>Watches cannot chime without movement. A chiming gold watch can sound the time when a button is pressed. In the past, watches were also called "self-moving watches" or "time watches," but they were commonly referred to as "watches."</p>
<p>Clocks and watches were considered rare treasures in the early Qing Dynasty. After the opening of the sea ban during the Daoguang era, circulation gradually increased. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras, Guo Songtao wrote to Li Hongzhang, saying, "Clocks, watches, and toys are in every household." However, they are still not as common as they are in society today.</p>
<p>In the past, China did not have clocks and watches, so water clocks, or copper dripping clocks, were used. The water clock system has a very long history. The Zhou Rituals mention the "Pitcher Carrier," who was in charge of carrying water to use in the water clock, and used water and fire to guard it, dividing day and night, so as to observe the water clock's filling and emptying, and distinguish the length of dusk and dawn.</p>

<h3>The Kuomintang and Communist Parties are Incredibly Harmonious and the United Front is Increasingly Solid; Rumors are Purely Malicious Slander; Military Discipline is Absolutely Supported by All Parties</h3>
<p>According to a recent observer and an authoritative foreign expert from mainland China, the relationship between some members of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is somewhat tense. However, the "United Front" between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party remains incredibly harmonious. There are indeed "disputes between the two parties, but various rumors from the outside are purely intentional fabrication and slander by those who deliberately undermine Chinese unity. The measures taken by the Chinese military authorities to rectify the discipline of the New Fourth Army, although regarded as "drastic measures," have not caused adverse effects in the country. Public opinion generally believes that this move is a necessary measure for rectifying military discipline.</p>
<p>No Rift Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party</p>
<p>The observer continued, "True Communist Party members who do not participate in the National Government are inevitably indignant about the disbandment of the New Fourth Army. However, people like Zhou Enlai remain calm about the government's order to disband the New Fourth Army and try to reconcile the existing disputes between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. At the same time, this action is advocated by some members of the Kuomintang, and most Kuomintang members are not involved in the matter. Therefore, it cannot be regarded as a split between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek's Prestige is Increasing</p>
<p>The reason why some members of the Kuomintang are strongly advocating the rectification of military discipline is that the Communist Party's army does not obey the orders issued by the supreme military authorities, which is admitted even by left-wing figures. The disbandment of the Communist army is believed to be "deserved." Those who oppose China's position exaggerate the matter, but they do not know that President Chiang Kai-shek is supported by all parties and that the resolution of this incident has further enhanced his prestige. Since the incident occurred, all parties have reiterated their loyalty to President Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>The United Front is Exceptionally Strong</p>
<p>The foreign observer has traveled to various places in Free China and has spoken with various people, from farmers and workers to government officials and military officers. None of them admit that the "United Front" is in danger of being split. Even Communist Party leaders think so. At the same time, all responsible parties believe that although liberalism is sometimes regarded as communism, the circulation of liberalism is still permitted during the war, and all parties are allowed to freely express their opinions.</p>
<p>Traitors Cannot Operate</p>
<p>The observer said, "There are many true liberals in China's 'youth army.' They all hold the belief of reforming society and hope to implement a social revolution to seek welfare for the people. When talking about the general political development of Free China, the observer said that the strength of the Kuomintang is an undeniable fact. In recent months, party leaders have strengthened the party's organization, and as a result, the opportunities for traitors and unruly elements hiding in Free China to operate have been greatly reduced. This situation is unprecedented since the outbreak of the Free War.</p>
<h3>Railway Tracks Near Jiaxing Bombed</h3>

<p>The case of four Chinese landlords suing the Public Works Department (工部局) for collecting land taxes was heard for the seventh time in the Consular Court at 2:30 pm yesterday in the conference hall on the second floor of the Public Works Department. The secretary of the Consular Court, Mr. Lang, the lawyer for the Public Works Department, Chuan Liang, the witness Ru Bao Yi, the plaintiffs Fang Jiaping, Hu Jingfang, Zhu Ruiqing, and Fang Wende, and the lawyers for the defense, Liu Shifang and Wang Jian, were all present. After announcing the opening of the court at 2:30 pm, lawyer Bolang asked the witness Ru Bao Yi about the evidence of land ownership. Lawyer Ru replied, "According to various ancient Chinese books, it is known that land ownership in China belongs to the emperor, not to the people." He presented eight or nine books in court as evidence, including Mencius, Zhouli, Hanshu, and Wenxian Tongkao. At around 3:00 pm, Bolang further questioned Mr. Middleton, the Director of the Department of Taxes, asking, "Why did the Public Works Department not collect taxes from landlords before 1937?" Mr. Middleton replied, "Because the names of the landlords were unknown, and the area of the land could not be found." Chuan Liang further asked Mr. Middleton, "If the land tax on Fang Dan were collected in 1940, what would be the annual tax amount?" Mr. Middleton replied, "The number is between 2 million and 3 million." At the appropriate time, the court adjourned, and it was decided that the hearing would continue at the original site of the Public Works Department this Friday (the 28th).</p>

Before leaving, Colonel Xiang Pei gave a farewell message to his subordinates, which read: "Before I hand over the position of commander of the Volunteer Corps to my successor, I am very pleased and grateful for the good work completed by all members under my command since 1937. In the past three years, the Volunteer Corps has undertaken extra work, the most notable of which was the defense of Area B of the Public Concession after the withdrawal of British troops in December last year. I am sure that every member has done their best. I am well aware that the defense work in Area B has sacrificed your rest time. At the same time, I would like to thank the senior officers of the corps, whose good advice, close cooperation, and friendship have helped me a lot. I attach great importance to the common goals and true international spirit of our corps, and I am especially grateful for your hospitality and kindness. I am sorry to leave Shanghai this time, but the pleasant memories of Shanghai will always be in my mind. The Volunteer Corps has had good achievements in the past. Maintaining this achievement in the future is also up to the efforts of each of you. I wish you all a bright future and good luck and prosperity in the future."</p>
<p>The Grand Farewell Banquet for the Corps</p>
<p>The officers of the entire Shanghai Volunteer Corps held a farewell banquet for Colonel Xiang Pei at the Corps Club the night before last at 6:30 pm. More than 90 people attended, including the captains and senior officers of the various corps affiliated to the corps.

Chen made a farewell speech on behalf of the captains of all the corps and presented a silver gift engraved with the signatures of the senior officers as a memento. The commander then stood up to thank him and returned a clock to the Officers' Association to express his reluctance. In his speech, the commander praised the spirit of serving the public and cooperating for public security by eliminating national prejudices among all members of the corps. The meeting ended at 8:30 pm with everyone happily dispersing.</p>
<h3>Election of the Public Works Department Board; American Candidates Confirmed; Japanese Residents to Campaign Next Week; Number Ratio to Maintain Current Status</h3>
<p>The deadline for American residents in this city to nominate candidates for the American director of the Public Works Department is only one day away. However, the American Association has not received the names of other candidates besides the two already nominated, Aleman and Minstred. It is believed that the American residents may not nominate others again, so it may not be necessary to hold a primary election. It is reported that the Japanese residents in this city have begun preparations to nominate candidates for the next Japanese director of the Public Works Department. The details of the Japanese residents' election campaign are not yet known, but it is generally believed that the Japanese residents will formally launch their election campaign at the beginning of next week. As for the British residents, it is expected that they will follow the usual practice and hold a primary election for the British director candidates of the Public Works Department at the beginning of next week, but the details are unknown, and the names of the British director candidates are also not yet known. It is generally believed that the board election of the Public Works Department, which will be held on April 2nd and 3rd this year, will maintain its current status again, and the taxpayer's annual meeting will be held on April 17th. It is expected that the Japanese residents will follow the procedures of the past few years and nominate five Japanese director candidates, and the Western electors will maintain the current ratio of five British directors, two American directors, and two Japanese directors.</p>

<h3>Cixi Purchases Grain Fund; Shanghai Lends 100,000</h3>
<p>Cixi is purchasing 250 dan of grain from Ninghai. The grain purchase fund was previously decided by the County Grain Adjustment Committee, with the county raising 200,000 yuan and Shanghai raising 100,000 yuan. A telegram was sent to Mr. Qin Runqing, a charitable person from Cixi in Shanghai, requesting him to allocate the funds quickly. Mr. Qin replied in a telegram that Shanghai would lend 100,000 yuan and that Yong Ken Ye had been telegraphed to issue a receipt. The bank must send a person to Cixi to supervise. In addition, the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai allocated 60,000 yuan to relieve the famine in the county and assigned representatives to distribute the funds by district. (1) 10,000 yuan was allocated to the urban area, and another 20,000 yuan was raised by the representatives. All of the funds were used to set up porridge distribution. It was entrusted to Mr. Zhou Pin and Luo Shen Boying Dezi in the urban area's Ti Ren Shan Tang, starting on December 1st of last year. More than 1,200 people came to drink porridge every day. It is now planned to run until the end of June. The funds were claimed by Mr. Qin. (2) 10,000 yuan was allocated to the eastern township, which was claimed by Yao Lianfang, Qiu Baoxing, and Ge Weian. (3) 15,000 yuan was allocated to the southern township, which was claimed by Li Xiangfan. (4) 10,000 yuan was allocated to the western township, which was claimed by Yuan Mengqin. (5) 15,000 yuan was allocated to the northern township, which was claimed by Shen Xingde and Chen Chengxu. They all raised some additional funds and entrusted local impartial gentry to distribute them by township to ensure widespread distribution.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Establishes a New Committee to Study Opening up New Tax Sources; Reviews the Authority of Donations and Taxes According to the Regulations; and Seeks to Expand the Scope of License Coverage for Various Industries</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently approved the suggestion of the "Tax Revenue Research Sub-Committee" under the Economic Committee and decided to establish another sub-committee under the Finance Committee to be responsible for studying new tax sources to increase revenue. The committee's task is to study: (1) The situation of various industries that can be ordered to obtain licenses according to regulations but have not actually done so; (2) The scope of license coverage that can be expanded for various industries; (3) Entirely new tax sources. The members of the committee include Mr. Xi Yushu, Geddu, Hale, Liddell, Okamoto, and Saduq, all of whom are members of the "Tax Revenue Research Committee" under the Economic Committee. If the recommendations made by the new committee are adopted, they will do their best to promote their implementation. If various sectors wish to express their opinions on this issue, they can submit them in writing to Mr. Allen, the secretary of the committee. The final report of the Tax Revenue Research Sub-Committee is appended below.</p>
<p>Reconsidering the Tax Authority</p>
<p>(1) It is recommended to set up a new committee to explore new sources of revenue. The issues discussed in the first report of this committee only relate to the issue of increasing license fees. The reasons are: (A) The collection of license fees is clearly stipulated in the regulations, so that the Public Works Department and the taxpayers have this authority within a certain scope without doubt; (B) This committee believes that the Bureau urgently needs to increase revenue from the beginning of this year. According to the investigation, the donations and taxes currently collected by the Bureau are limited to land tax, house tax, advertising tax, license fees, wharf donations, and public utility franchise fees. The power granted to the Bureau to collect taxes by the land charter is absolutely limited to the collection of the above-mentioned donations and taxes due to its historical and customary interpretation, and has not been changed. Although this committee has never further reviewed the conventional interpretation of this layer in the land charter, it believes that the Bureau should not stick to old habits. For the sake of municipal finance, it is indeed necessary to expand the scope of donations and taxes. It is necessary to reconsider the scope of the authority granted to taxpayers by the land charter and the attached charters. Regarding the license fee layer, what this committee discussed only related to the various items currently collected in fact. The various industries that can be ordered to obtain licenses have been specifically listed in the regulations. It is well known that there are several other items that can be ordered to obtain licenses according to regulations but have never been implemented, as if the Bureau believes that it does not have this authority itself. This committee believes that the Bureau should immediately re-study and devise ways to expand the scope of license coverage for various industries. Based on the above, this committee recommends setting up another regular sub-committee under the Finance Committee to be responsible for studying the above-mentioned issues.</p>
<p>Improving the Organization of Donation and Tax Work</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Donation and Tax Division of the Finance Department, the work of the Donation and Tax Division is quite complicated. Some of it is financial, such as collecting donations, estimating rent, and issuing licenses. The other part is not related to finance and involves the compilation of the list of electors, Bureau elections, and taxpayer meetings. This division was transferred from the General Office to the Finance Department in 1932. The important part of the reorganization plan had been completed before the war. Last year, nine donation collection branches were added in the urban area to facilitate donation services, and eleven Chinese inspectors were hired to replace foreign staff who performed the same duties. As a result, the results were good. Both working hours and travel expenses have been reduced. As far as the organization of the Donation and Tax Division is concerned, its efficient and economical operation is quite satisfactory.</p>
<h3>The French Veterans Association in China is Ordered to Reorganize</h3>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported that the French Ambassador to China, Gossimer, recently received an order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of his country on January 22 and, in accordance with Article 5 of the decree promulgated on August 19, 1940, announced the dissolution of the Veterans Associations in China and reorganized them into the French Veterans Association, led by the local Consul General, Consul, or local chief officer, who is responsible for guiding. All deposits in the previous Veterans Association were transferred to the newly established small organizational committee, which is responsible for allocating and keeping them. The membership fee is limited to the use of relieving veterans.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Encountered Two Ambush Attacks Near Yangshupu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Near a small river near Qiqihar Road and Pingliang Road in Yangshupu, at 1:05 pm yesterday, Ishii, a sergeant of the Shanghai Japanese Marine Corps, and Toda Masaichi, a private first class, were passing through the area when two young men followed them silently. They pulled out their guns from behind and fired. One bullet hit 武田正一's right cheek, penetrated his right chest, and he fell to the ground. Because the vital part was injured, he died on the spot. Another bullet hit Sergeant Ishii's right chest, and he also collapsed. Blood flowed like a spring.</p>
<p>Japanese Alert</p>
<p>After hearing the news, the nearby Japanese Marine Corps immediately dispatched a large number of armed Japanese soldiers to the scene of the incident to search in all directions. It is said that one of the shooters was captured. Afterwards, the Japanese Marine Corps Military Police, the Japanese Consulate Police, and Chinese and Western detectives from the Patrol Force rushed to the above-mentioned location to investigate and search, and imposed special martial law on the Pingliang Road area of Yangshupu, cutting off traffic, and the situation was tense. Except for the Japanese, no one was allowed to pass, and house-to-house searches were carried out. At the same time, all bridges over the Suzhou River leading to the central area of the concession, such as Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Zhabu Road Bridge, and Pentang Lane Bridge, were closed. After about two hours, the strict martial law was lifted and traffic was restored. It was impossible to find out where the injured Sergeant Ishii was sent for treatment for a while. It was reported that his injuries were serious.</p>
<p>Gunshots Last Night</p>
<p>At around 8:00 pm last night, near Weituoma Road and Yangzhou Road in Yangshupu, a Japanese Marine Corps soldier was suddenly shot twice by someone. It was not clear whether he was hit or where he was injured. The shooter fled into the crowd and disappeared.</p>
<h3>Temporary Interruption of Public Transportation in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Around 2 PM the day before yesterday, workers in the machine room of the French Tramway Company in the French Concession suddenly went on strike, creating a very tense situation. To maintain order within the concession and prevent worker disturbances, the French police dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to be stationed at various roads and tram stations. However, since the drivers and ticket sellers in the machine room were not involved in the turmoil, the trams on various routes were still able to operate as usual. Unexpectedly, yesterday</p>
<p>3:50 PM</p>
<p>The trolleybuses on routes 17, 18, and 24 and the buses on routes 21 and 22 of the French Tramway Company suddenly went on strike during operation, causing vehicles to stop on various roads. Especially near Route Lafayette and Route Petain, more than ten buses were stranded. Most of the trolleybuses on routes 17 and 18 were concentrated near Nanyang Bridge, causing the public transportation in the French Concession to come to a complete standstill. It was not until 4:20 PM that the company authorities persuaded the workers to return to work, and the drivers and ticket sellers of various vehicles continued their work, allowing the vehicles on various routes to</p>
<p>operate as usual.</p>
<p>However, fearing incidents along the way, the trolleybuses and buses on all routes were driven in groups of three to prevent accidents. Regarding the sudden strike, a brawl involving dozens of new and old workers occurred in front of the tram company on Route Luban yesterday afternoon at 3 PM. More than ten people were detained at the time. The new workers were members of the "Labor Union." Simultaneously, fights between new and old workers were reported in various places. At 6:30 PM in the evening, similar struggles occurred in front of the Great World entertainment center, and one tram on Route 17 was also stoned by workers, causing damage and stopping service. At 6 PM last night,</p>
<p>Tram Drivers</p>
<p>and ticket sellers also went on strike, causing trams on various routes to suddenly stop service on Route Thibet and Avenue Joffre. Nearly a hundred trams were lined up in a long row in the middle of the road. After mediation by the company authorities and the police authorities, the situation returned to normal after half an hour.</p>

<h3>All Parties Pay Attention to People's Livelihood and Strive to Reverse the Trend of Rice Prices. Results Have Been Achieved, and Rice and Grain Must Be Sold Out Within a Time Limit. It Is Reported That a Large Amount of National Rice Will Arrive in Shanghai Within Days.</h3>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry and the Miscellaneous Grains, Oil Cakes Industry Trade Associations jointly appointed Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and Fu Qiangeng last night to pay a visit to Mr. Hodekui, Deputy General Manager of the Public Concession's Public Works Department, and requested (1) to appoint personnel to join the rice industry investigators to thoroughly investigate the grain reserves in various rice and grain warehouses; (2) to telegraph the Hong Kong government to allow the normal export of rice and grain shipped to Shanghai to help the Shanghai people's livelihood. The authorities have already done so, and they have instructed to handle the various measures for the rice industry as discussed. It was also reported yesterday that hundreds of thousands of bags of national rice may be shipped to Shanghai at the end of this month or early October. If this is true, the price of rice may improve.</p>
<p>Time Limit for Clearing Warehouse Rice</p>
<p>The Concession authorities convened a meeting with rice industry leaders on December 9 last year to discuss ways to stabilize the rice market. It was resolved that from December 12 last year, a deposit of 5 Yuan must be paid for each bag of rice and grain after the transaction. If the payment is not made, it will be considered null and void, and the goods must be delivered and the full price paid within five days without delay. However, since the implementation of this measure, some unscrupulous rice merchants have still openly complied but secretly violated the rules, firmly hoarding goods and unwilling to sell them easily, resulting in a sharp reduction in the number of spot goods on the market, even to the point where there were no goods to meet the market demand. It has now been resolved by the Bean and Rice and Miscellaneous Grains Industries Trade Associations that all rice and grain transactions made before the 24th must be settled clearly before the 27th, otherwise, they will be sold separately and the deposit will be confiscated. The market has been publicly notified yesterday for all to know.</p>
<p>Brokers Postponed Entry to the Market</p>
<p>Due to the frequent rise in rice prices, there have been many complaints from the outside world about rice brokers. The Brokers Association has now notified its members to postpone entering the market during this chaotic rice market to avoid external criticism. Some members have accepted the advice, and although some members have entered the market, it is said that they have not brokered rice and grain. The association has also sent people to the market to monitor the actions of its members.</p>
<h3>Firmly Defend the Outer Bulwark of the Pacific; China Must Fight a Protracted War (3)</h3>
<p>— Soong Tzu-wen</p>
<p>Serving as the head of the Army News Group, he openly stated that if there are no drastic changes in the world situation, there is very little hope of completely collapsing China's resistance. Colonel Mabuchi also earnestly warned the Japanese people not to be optimistic about the Tripartite Pact, because the international trend is not only not beneficial to Japan but also beneficial to Chongqing. Colonel Mabuchi, who is known for his directness, further stated that the current situation in China is extremely complex and cannot be understood with common sense alone. Japan is currently fighting Chiang Kai-shek's army, and even if it defeats it, it will not solve the Sino-Japanese War. The majority of people gathered under Chiang's banner are truly outstanding patriotic elements in China, and their backing is the United States, Britain, and other countries, all of whom want to maintain the original order in East Asia. Japan should fully recognize the efforts of the anti-Japanese camp in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Since 1493, when the Catholic Pope planned to divide the world outside of Europe between Spain and Portugal, the recent pacts of the Axis powers to divide spheres of influence can be called the most ambitious and complete attempt to divide the world. The most important area for Japan's share of the spoils is China and the South Pacific, including Annam, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Siam, Burma, and India, or even Australia and New Zealand. There are other rich spoils of war that greed could not have dreamed of. It is not easy for Japan to think of annexing and obtaining them, and it is especially difficult to break through the Singapore military port.</p>
<p>Singapore currently does not have the assistance of the British main fleet, and it is not an opponent of Japan to rely solely on the strength of the Australian and Dutch fleets, because Japan has the support of the army in addition to its entire naval and air forces. Some say that to attack Singapore, one should consider the formidable US fleet, but the Japanese believe that when their allied countries launch a large-scale attack on the British mainland, Gibraltar, and the Suez Canal, if Japan simultaneously attacks Singapore, the crisis in the Atlantic will increase, and the United States may ignore the fate of Singapore, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>Although the strength of the Japanese fleet and air force has been slightly damaged, the strength of the army cannot be concentrated to assist its great southward advance plan. According to estimates by neutral military experts, the number of Japanese troops killed in action, died of disease, and permanently lost combat power due to injuries in China is more than one million. In addition, there are 1.25 million people trapped in China, not including those in the three eastern provinces defending against Russia. However, the general opinion of military experts is that the economic law of diminishing returns makes it impossible for the Japanese to organize new troops to engage in new adventures. The reasonable step for the Japanese in this situation should be to withdraw their large troops and transport ships from China. In the past six months, China has repeatedly received requests for peace from Japan, and the conditions have gradually eased. The Japanese know that there is no hope of eliminating the Chinese army in the short term, but time is passing, and their southward advance plan cannot be delayed any longer. Then why not negotiate peace with China so that they can withdraw their troops to engage in the development of the South Pacific? If the adventure in Singapore succeeds, there will be unlimited resources of oil, rubber, tin, rice, cotton, etc. in hand, and by cutting off the Burma Road, they can slowly besiege China. Therefore, Japan is now giving China fairly generous peace terms, because after the fall of Singapore, all treaties signed with China will naturally lose their effectiveness.</p>
<p>These theories are extremely reasonable, but because they are reasonable, the Chinese also understand Japan extremely well. The withdrawal of a large army would temporarily give us a chance to breathe, but the fall of Singapore would be a great misfortune for China and extremely unfavorable to Britain, and even the United States would feel the same disadvantage. To make peace with the Japanese now is only a temporary truce, and the benefits are entirely on the Japanese side. The Sino-Japanese conflict is part of a global struggle, so China will only be able to enjoy lasting peace after the global war is resolved. We must continue to fight, not only to maintain our army's original positions but also to pressure the Japanese army so that it cannot withdraw its troops to plan for a southward advance. Since the start of the war, China has lost more than two million soldiers, but now China has a strong army of 2.5 million regular troops and countless guerrillas. From all aspects, the organization, strength, and experience of its army are far superior to what they were at the start of the war. On the Japanese side, the area of deployment is wide, the army is deployed without a clear purpose, discipline is lax, and morale is low. Therefore, if our country adopts a decisive offensive, it will surely achieve great results.</p>
<p>China has encountered two major difficulties in this war: a lack of financial resources and a lack of aircraft. The financial problem is very easy to understand. More than three years of war have caused considerable destruction, and the richest industrial areas have either been occupied or destroyed. Most of the transportation has been destroyed, and the transportation and supplies for millions of troops must be maintained. The value of the national currency in foreign exchange has fallen to one-fifth of its pre-war value, while domestic prices have risen to six times their pre-war level. Fortunately, the United States and Britain have opportunistically provided China with considerable assistance in terms of loans and credit. Recently, someone came from China and mentioned that President Roosevelt's declaration of lending China 100 million in loans has indeed had an encouraging impact in China. As a certain commentator said, this declaration is a new guarantee of ultimate victory for the oppressed Chinese people.</p>
<p>The aircraft problem is indeed not easy to solve. The United States, Britain, and other countries also feel the lack of aircraft, so this problem has attracted general attention. I intend to discuss it in more detail. The number of Chinese aircraft has never exceeded one-tenth of that of Japan. Although the strength is very different, fortunately, our country has a vast territory and countless airfields scattered everywhere. In the inland war, we can get the help of loyal villagers. Coupled with the daredevil courage of our air force, we have been able to maintain resistance for three years, shooting down twice as many Japanese planes as we have lost. Until September last year, the situation changed. From that time on, the Japanese changed to using more efficient aircraft, so in addition to quantity, their quality was also superior to our aircraft, and it became more difficult for our aircraft to take off and resist.</p>
<p>People around the world are also accustomed to seeing the tragic situation of indiscriminate bombing of British towns, but the British at least have anti-aircraft guns, balloon nets, and fighter planes to repel them, and they have bombers for retaliation. In China today, we only see Japanese planes leisurely flying over towns, selecting targets, and safely dropping bombs without encountering resistance or the danger of retaliation. On May 3 and 4, 1939, Japanese planes heavily bombed the civilians of Chongqing, and the number of people who died from bombing and burning was about 10,000, which was more than the total number of deaths and injuries from the heavy bombing of London in six months.</p>
<p>The democratic countries' need for aircraft is indeed difficult, but China still has reasons to insist on the supply of aircraft. Our country has wiped out more than one million Japanese troops in a long war of attrition, and has also contained 1.25 million troops, preventing them from being used to assist their allies, Germany and Italy. China's war, in the past and in the future, has been beneficial to the democratic countries. The allocation of aircraft must also be weighed and compared in terms of quantity. In the Battle of Britain, the number of aircraft needed should be counted in the thousands or even tens of thousands. In China, a relatively small number of aircraft can create miracles, encourage morale, and assist the army in combat.</p>
<p>The Japanese are good at writing and ink, and it is rare to find their peers. Millions have been killed and injured in the Sino-Japanese conflict, and millions more are in combat, but they call it an accidental event and call it the "China Incident." The United States may maintain a neutral country status in this world war, but no matter how Americans praise us, we now firmly defend the outer bulwark of the American Pacific, and we regard ourselves as a partner of the United States. Since I came to the United States, I have felt the deep friendship of the people of this country for China everywhere. I think this is not only sympathy for the victims of aggression, not only recognition of our country's brave fighting, but I think there is something deeper than this in history, that is, a kind of natural and deep feeling that China is a great nation that can be trusted. At this time, we are fighting to prevent the war from spreading to the United States. If this nation can overcome this difficulty, it will surely be able to cooperate with the United States as a son of the United States to maintain the security of the Pacific. With God's blessing and your help, we will surely be able to achieve our wish.</p>

<h3>Yuan Chang Yarn Firm Forged Japanese Merchant Warehouse Receipts, Three Accomplices Arrested, the Principal Offender Is at Large, Fraudulent Funds of 500,000-600,000 Yuan, Bank Stopped Payment</h3>
<p>Yuan Chang Yarn Firm, located at No. 6, Lane 457, Ningbo Road, was opened by Jin Zhonghou. Recently, the firm accepted a large number of orders from peers. After collecting the deposit or payment for the goods, it issued warehouse receipts from Yu Feng Yarn Factory. Ruichangxing Cotton Cloth Firm, which shared the same building as Yuanchang, had issued more than 25,000 yuan in checks from Zikangzhuang, etc., to Yuanchang and was given</p>
<p>Yu Feng Warehouse Receipts</p>
<p>Several receipts. Ruichangxing discovered that the words "Unified Tax" on the receipts were reversed, which aroused suspicion. While inquiring with Yuanchang, it also instructed an apprentice to check with Yu Feng Factory the day before yesterday. The Japanese at the factory discovered that the receipts were forged. The Japanese reported this to the Central Police Station. Chinese Detective Yang Peiniu, Detective Wu Chunrong, and Detective Zhu Wanjun rushed to Yuanchang, arresting Wang Yating, Pan Zheru, and Li Guoqing, three people. They confiscated</p>
<p>More Than 30 Forged Receipts</p>
<p>and more than 90 yuan in cash. They also went to Room 509 of the Jinmen Hotel but failed to arrest Jin Zhonghou. They confiscated dozens of seals and found that Yuanchang had collected a total of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan from other customers. However, what the customers had paid were banker's drafts due on the 24th. The detectives immediately went to various banks and money houses to stop payment. According to the statements of the banks and money houses, because they were all banker's drafts, they could not stop payment without a court order, so</p>
<p>the police requested</p>
<p>that they temporarily withhold payment until 3:00 PM tomorrow (i.e., yesterday) to await the court's order. Yesterday morning, the police sent the three arrested suspects to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the process and requested that a stop-payment order be issued. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered that the three suspects, including Wang, be detained for one week. The police's request for a stop-payment order was approved.</p>
<h3>Truth About the Attack on Dr. Shen Jian'an. He Was Discharged from the Hospital Yesterday After Recovering.</h3>
<p>It is learned that Dr. Shen Jian'an, a doctor who studied in Japan, and his Japanese wife, Zhuzi, were attacked and injured at their clinic at No. 50, Mauris New Village, Lane 429, Race Course Road at around 10:00 AM on the 21st. Shen's facial injuries have healed, and he was discharged from the hospital and returned home yesterday morning. However, his wife's injuries are still serious, but after surgery, her life may not be in danger. Yesterday, Dr. Shen sent a letter detailing the truth of the case as follows:</p>
<p>On Friday, the 21st of this month, at about 10:00 AM, two people came to the clinic seeking treatment. One had stubborn ringworm, and the other had trachoma. I followed the usual procedure of registering them and they voluntarily reported their surname as Wang on the examination slip. After the doctor applied the medicine and so on, they left. The next day (i.e., the 22nd), Saturday morning, the person with trachoma came with another person. After I greeted them and asked them to sit down, the person named Wang came with another person wearing a suit. As soon as they reached the entrance of the consultation room, the person in the suit pulled out a pistol and told us not to make a sound. I realized they were robbers and told them that if they wanted anything, they were welcome to take it. The robber wanted the diamond ring that my wife, Zhuzi, was wearing on her finger. Because the ring was too tight, she couldn't take it off. After a moment of struggle, the three people wearing Chinese clothing left hurriedly and fled downstairs. At this time, the robber in the suit shouted to them, "Don't go!" Seeing that the robber was alone and losing ground, I bravely embraced him from behind. My wife screamed for help. Fearing things would go wrong, the robber struggled and fired a shot at me, then turned around and fired another shot at my face. At this point, I lost consciousness and let go. The robber took the opportunity to escape downstairs. Afterwards, I was taken to Fumin Hospital by ambulance for treatment. I went to Fumin Hospital because I was sent there in the ambulance for treatment, and also because my wife, Zhuzi, was seriously injured and needed someone to accompany her. Now that I see the facts in the newspaper are untrue, and also because I have been practicing medicine in Shanghai since returning from studying in Dongying (Japan), striving for further study in medicine, and have no political connections whatsoever, I am recounting the process as above to clarify the truth so that I can live without shame. Shen Jian'an, February 25. He committed suicide because of this.</p>
<h3>Once Well-Fed and Well-Clothed, He Ended Up as a Beggar in Chongqing. He Used to Work as a Pattern Maker for a Foreign Company's Construction Project, Became Addicted to Drugs, Was Dismissed, Expelled from His Home, and Died of Illness on the Street.</h3>
<p>Lu Xiaomao from Shaoxing, 23 years old this year, used to work as a pattern maker for a foreign company's construction project. His income was quite high. He had an elderly mother, Lu Zhang, in her sixties, and a wife and three children. Their life was comfortable. However, Lu made bad friends and became addicted to opium. When the foreman in the company found out, he was dismissed. Instead of improving himself, he willingly fell into depravity and switched to taking the drug heroin. When he ran out of money, he even stole clothes from his house and sold them to support his addiction. His mother and wife were unable to prevent him and could not bear his burden, so he was expelled by his mother and wife and not allowed to return home. The family's livelihood was taken care of by relatives. Lu's situation reached the point where he was destitute. He begged during the day and stayed in opium dens or alleys at night. For a year, he suffered from hunger and cold. He became ill a few days ago. He had been staying in a heroin den in Ruifu Lane, Zilaishui Street. Because his illness became more serious, he was kicked out by the den owner and slept on the street at the foot of the wall at the entrance of Ruifu Lane, Dongzilaishui Street. Unable to withstand the wind and rain, he died on the morning of the 24th. The police notified the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall to collect the body. Then his fellow beggars notified his family. Yesterday, the deceased's mother and wife went to the hall to identify the body in tears and took it back for burial. It is truly lamentable that such a talented person who was well-versed in Chinese and Western knowledge was harmed by opium and heroin and ended up in such a way.</p>
<h3>Paint Merchant Wang Zuolin Escapes Danger Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Social News Agency, Wang Zuolin from Wuxi, owner of the Fuchang Paint Store at No. 182, Route Foch, 59 years old, was kidnapped alone by five bandits on the morning of January 5 this year when he, his son Zonggan, and his brother-in-law Xi Lusheng were driving his own car, No. 1936, from his residence via Route Foch and Rue de la Caserne. There was no news of him until now. It is now learned that Wang escaped danger yesterday. It is reported that after Wang was kidnapped, he was secretly hidden by the bandits on a hat-and-awning boat on the Wusong River in Zhabei for a long time. Yesterday, the "water police" received a tip and went to solve the case, arresting three bandits.</p>
<h3>Zhou Brothers' Parricide Case: Zhou Jing was Found Not Guilty. The Higher Second Court Retried the Case and Released Her in Court Yesterday.</h3>
<p>In the sensational case of Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang brothers killing their father, Zhou Yongjie, after the police filed a complaint with the Special First District Court, Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang were sentenced to death, and their mother, Zhou Jing, was also sentenced to two years and six months in prison for assisting in the destruction of the body. The defendants refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. As a result, the appeal was rejected by the Higher Court. Zhou Jing, represented by lawyers Jiang Bao, Jiang Pingfan, Yang Linzhi, Yang Sicheng, Ye Shaoying, etc., appealed to the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court. Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang also filed appeals to the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court. After carefully reviewing the case files, the Supreme Court Branch determined that the Zhou brothers' guilt was clearly proven and could not be pardoned, so it rejected the appeal and upheld the death sentence. For Zhou Jing's part, it was believed that there were still doubts that required investigation, so the judgment was sent back to the Second Branch of the Higher Court for retrial. The case was brought up by the Second Branch of the Higher Court, and Zhou was still defended by lawyers Jiang and others. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou Han, the Chief of the Criminal Court of the Second Branch of the Higher Court, along with two judges, Nie and Zhao, took the bench in the First Criminal Court. Zhou Jing was in court waiting for instructions, represented by lawyer Jiang Pingfan. Judge Zhou then announced the judgment, the main text of which was: The part of the original judgment concerning Zhou Jing is revoked; Zhou Jing is not guilty. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian declared in court that he would abandon the appeal, and Zhou Jing was released in court. This sensational case of moral decay came to an end.</p>

<h3>Dart King</h3>
<p>— Xiu Bi</p>
<p>Although it was the cold early spring, they were still shirtless.</p>
<p>One of them was the master, and the other two were disciples. The master was the father, and the disciples were the sons.</p>
<p>Every day, in two sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, they first laid out two rows of eighteen kinds of weapons on a piece of mud.</p>
<p>Then, the master pursed his lips: "Everyone! Everyone!"</p>
<p>"Look at the fists, the fists, look!" People formed a circle around them.</p>
<p>The master opened his mouth:</p>
<p>"Friends, what are you here to see today? Some friends say they are here to see Qian Yunbiao, the Dart King. Very well! Very well! I am Qian Yunbiao, the Dart King. Qian Yunbiao, the Dart King, is none other than this face of mine..."</p>
<p>"Today, I have brought two little disciples to display our family's unique skills, entirely for the purpose of helping the poor and relieving poverty, an open exhibition, with not a penny taken. If I were to take a penny from you all, may I be a bastard tortoise..."</p>
<p>The Dart King waved his hands, turned around, and the words he spoke also took a turn:</p>
<p>"However, although I don't want copper coins, I would like to ask you all to help me with a small favor, to promote some things. What things?"</p>
<p>"I won't say it yet, let me and my two little disciples first perform a set of 'goods' for you all to see!" After saying this, he retreated to the corner.</p>
<p>The two shirtless disciples, upon hearing these words, scurried onto the stage, practiced a fight, and then each chose a position, waving their hands and feet, and striking a "pose."</p>
<p>They hit each other, "crack, crack," making strange loud noises.</p>
<p>After the fight, they also performed a real sword-and-spear battle.</p>
<p>Amidst the applause, the Dart King then walked forward a few steps and bowed to the audience.</p>
<p>"Good! Good!" He humorously imitated the voices of the crowd, shouting: "But hold on, the main show hasn't started yet..."</p>
<p>What show? It turned out to be a dart performance.</p>
<p>One disciple squatted on the ground, holding a copper coin in his hand. The Dart King then took an iron dart with a long rope tied to it from the weapon rack.</p>
<p>"People say I am the Dart King, but I dare not claim that title." He tied the dart to his arm and bowed to the audience around him: "However, I have practiced this set of darts for over ten years... How to perform darts, the first is 'hitting objects in the palm,' the second is... oh, hold on..."</p>
<p>"Wait, today I really don't have a penny, my stomach is too empty, I can't get any strength, what to do!" The disciple began to sing a false tune.</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right." The master also chimed in: "Let's ask you all to help us out first!" So they took out a black package next to the weapon rack. They opened it, and inside it was full of black plasters.</p>
<p>The master first bragged about the plaster for a while.</p>
<p>"Today, we have to sell at least fifty of them."</p>
<p>"Forty should be enough!" The disciple added a supplement.</p>
<p>"Twenty then!" The master automatically reduced it by twenty more.</p>
<p>Among the audience, there were immediately people who wanted to buy them. Ten minutes later, only five plasters were left.</p>
<p>The dart performance then began...</p>
<p>First, the disciple squatted on the ground, with a copper coin in the palm of his hand. A dart flew, the copper coin fell, but the palm was unharmed, so the audience shouted "Bravo!"</p>
<p>Next, the copper coin was placed on top of the head. A dart flew, and the copper coin fell as before, the head unharmed, and they heard another shout of "Bravo!"</p>
<p>Finally, the copper coin was moved to the bridge of the nose, the dart flew, and also as before, they received shouts of praise.</p>
<p>But that wasn't rare enough. The Dart King's unique skill was also there, which was to irregularly wrap the rope around his body and tie knots. When he turned around, the knots untied themselves, and the dart flew out, hitting the copper coin without fail. This time the shouts of praise were even greater than before.</p>
<p>The Dart King then boasted to the audience with a smile on his face: "I'm not bragging! I, Qian Yunbiao, have been throwing darts like this every day for over ten years, and I have never once missed or made a mistake. This is all from my hard practice..."</p>
<p>But one day, it was the day before the heavy snowfall, the weather was particularly cold; the Dart King's shirtless body was shivering, and he was also hungry all day. When the dart flew out, his hand weakened, and it just happened to hit the bridge of the disciple's nose.</p>
<p>The disciple fainted on the spot, while there was a burst of wild laughter around him. That burst of wild laughter pierced the heart of this "King," and his face was both iron-green and pale...</p>
<p>From that day on, people could no longer find the Dart King's踪迹 on that empty space.</p>
<h3>"The Way"</h3>
<p>— Shu Ying</p>
<p>Zhuangzi is recorded as Dongguo Zi asking Zhuangzi, "Where does the so-called Way reside?" Zhuangzi said, "It is everywhere... in tiles... in excrement and urine." It can be seen that Zhuangzi had great "foresight," and today, thousands of years later, it is truly "the Way is in excrement and urine"; not only "in," but also "overflowing"!</p>
<p>If "even thieves have their way," if "the Way also has thieves"; if "using the Way as theft," if "using theft as the Way"... yet despite the fact that everyone in the world "knows it like the back of their hand," it is still a case of "my Way is not lonely"!</p>
<p>There are many Ways, but even more people steal the Way. Now, as long as you donate a few dozen piculs of white rice and flaunt your "benevolence" in the newspaper; or sit in a fancy chair in some "association"... then you are completely a "person of the Way," and even the "robbed" cannot help but praise the "Way" with their mouths full!</p>
<p>"The Way is in excrement and urine"... ultimately: Is it the Way? Is it theft? Or is it stealing the Way?</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Before Zhao Si could finish speaking, Shen Mazi snorted through his nostrils, raised his right thumb, and sneered repeatedly:</p>
<p>"Old Brother, don't try to scare people with these young masters! Master Yuan Qi, is he Mr. Wu's father? You're singing, can he interfere? If he really likes keeping young female roles, why doesn't he just take Mr. Wu into his house?"</p>
<p>Zhao Si didn't expect this big gangster to say such outrageous things, and his face flushed red. Leaning against Begonia's bed, he was so angry that he kept shouting, "What kind of talk is this? What kind of talk is this?" Begonia himself was so angry that he turned green, but he didn't dare to offend this local tyrant.</p>
<p>"Are you talking, or farting?" Zhao Yukun gently stood up from the stool and looked Shen Mazi up and down.</p>
<p>Shen Mazi slid down from the table and was a full foot taller than Yukun.</p>
<p>"Hey kid! Who are you?" He pointed his thumb, almost directly at Yukun's face, and asked.</p>
<p>Yukun simply leaned his body slightly to the side, letting the thumb pass to the left.</p>
<p>"Are you asking me? My name is Zhao Yukun. Let me tell you! Shen, you invited him, whether the ticket sales are good or not, that's your own luck. What's the point of messing with him?"</p>
<p>Shen Mazi didn't expect that this young man with tattered clothes and a wretched appearance was Zhao Yukun, the martial clown who sang Shi Qian and Zhu Guangzu on stage every day, was very popular off stage, and was unexpectedly the fifth performer. He didn't want to offend him, but in front of Begonia and Zhao Si, he couldn't bring himself to back down. He had to keep his face green and say angrily:</p>
<p>"Whether the ticket sales are good or not depends on luck, of course, but his face is too tender to sing jokes, isn't that just being kept at home..." (40)</p>
<h3>The Poor Rob the Poor</h3>
<p>— Guo Wenqiang</p>
<p>A Mao Gou's father walked home dejectedly, holding a basket in his left hand and clenching his fist tightly in his right. He ran up the stairs in one breath and rushed into the loft, causing the loft floor to creak. He threw the basket onto the bed, speaking in a loud voice, as if he were roaring:</p>
<p>"Damn it, bad luck, this is the third time!"</p>
<p>A Mao Gou and his mother saw him come back with an empty basket in his hand, and thought it was a happy thing. Didn't an empty basket mean that the basket of things they had just taken out had been completely exchanged for legal tender? However, when they heard the words "Damn it," they already knew something was wrong, especially since there was also the sentence "This is the third time." This really startled A Mao Gou's mother, and she quickly put down the children's clothing from Taixing Company that she was embroidering, paying attention to the basket on the bed.</p>
<p>"What's wrong this time?" She asked A Mao Gou's father.</p>
<p>A Mao Gou's father sat on the bed, so angry that he could barely breathe.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Just look at the basket!" A Mao Gou's father spoke in a very heavy voice, and there was an echo in the loft.</p>
<p>"Could it be that it was robbed again?"</p>
<p>A Mao Gou was picking up the peanut candies on the bed, which had rolled out of the basket. A Mao Gou counted them, there were only nine big ones and some broken ones.</p>
<p>"It was that unkillable Biegui (a derogatory term for a poor person) again, he darted up from behind me, grabbed the basket in one hand and ran, stuffing peanut candies into his pocket as he ran." After a while, A Mao Gou's father said.</p>
<p>"Then why didn't you chase him? He deserves to die." She asked again, and her voice was also higher than before, obviously angry.</p>
<p>"Chase! Do you think I didn't chase him? Otherwise, this basket would have been taken away by this bastard too."</p>
<p>Every morning and noon, A Mao Gou's father always took a basket of peanut candies, and sometimes some five-spice beans, and stood in the school district, waiting for the students to come. For some reason, these days have been very unfavorable, for three days in a row, the peanut candies taken out to sell were either completely robbed or robbed of most of them.</p>
<p>"I heard that those Biegui have a gang. If they rob us like this every day, how can we survive? Let's sell in another place." A Mao Gou's mother was sobbing.</p>
<p>At this time, A Mao Gou wiped his tears with his sleeve, he looked at his father, then at his mother, and said slowly:</p>
<p>"Mom, they don't have food to eat, and we are often hungry too, why do they have to rob us? There are many rich people in Shanghai, why... do the poor rob the poor?..."</p>
<p>Strange, when his father heard A Mao Gou's words, his eyes also turned red.</p>

<h3>Lu Ming's Romance</h3>
<p>— Shou Wu</p>
<p>Lu Ming, known as the "Dream Lover of Movie Fans," has been out of touch since she went to Hong Kong. It wasn't until recently that someone rumored that she had secretly come to Shanghai to join Yi Hua to film, but this was just a castle in the air, reflecting the eagerness of hope, and was actually completely "air."</p>
<p>A little earlier than this "secretly come to Shanghai to film" rumor, there was also a piece of news about Lu Ming, saying that she had fallen in love with Zhang Huoyou, a young actor from Nanyang Company, due to their filming of "Grievances of Women's Quarters," and that the two often went out to play, and seemed very intimate.</p>
<p>This news, looked like it was very serious. As the saying goes, "Which young girl doesn't cherish spring?" It is only natural for Lu Ming to fall in love with a young man at her age.</p>
<p>However, common sense is not an iron law. In a recent letter to a friend, Lu Ming confessed about this matter:</p>
<p>"My first film after joining Nanyang was "Grievances of Women's Quarters," the male lead was Zhang Huoyou. In the film, his name is 'Jimi'. After filming for a week, there was such a shocking piece of news in the company's promotional publication 'Film Land': Lu Ming and Zhang Huoyou are in love, and she calls him Jimi Jimi very intimately on the set! The content was about how we fell in love, but this is actually something that happened in the film. What's hateful is that they didn't explain that this was the plot. Although everyone knows that this is just a promotional article, some people think it is a fact... Not long after, I saw similar news in Shanghai publications, but it had already been changed. Not only did it say that we were in love, but also that we were often together, alas, this is really wronging me..."</p>
<p>Movie stars are "people," and falling in love is not surprising, but people always seem particularly interested in the love affairs of movie stars. So, Lu Ming's confession about this "love affair" should definitely interest some people, right?</p>
<h3>Hollywood Stars' Quirks When Filming</h3>
<p>— Hui Lin</p>
<p>Olivia de Havilland doesn't like to use rouge on her face and lips before the camera, especially in the films she makes with Errol Flynn; she always sits quietly at home the day before filming, but not necessarily reading the script.</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney often runs into the studio from the factory gate, jumping and hopping, always carrying a small, all-black wiener dog with him; strangely enough, whenever Mickey goes to film any movie, this dog is always with him, and if he doesn't have the dog, Mickey's performance won't be good, because he's always thinking about it.</p>
<p>Henry Fonda, within hours of going on camera, although already in the makeup room, still recites his lines to himself and makes grand gestures, the situation is very realistic; people in the makeup room who like to joke often act with him, but Henry still pretends to be acting, making others embarrassed.</p>
<p>Chewing chocolate peanut brittle is Bette Davis's habit when filming, she often brings a box of candy to the set; at the same time, there are also several boxes of candy hidden in the company, originally sent by fans specifically for Bette, which she puts in the company, ready to take out and eat when filming.</p>
<p>Annabelle hates going to film on Friday mornings the most, because she thinks Friday mornings are the most unlucky time; she also likes to hum some songs in the makeup room to joke with the makeup staff. Annabelle is originally French, and is now Tyrone Power's wife, she has many habits, carrying an authentic Parisian flavor.</p>
<p>Spencer Tracy and George Brent both have a very good habit, which is to be very serious when filming, until the filming is finished.</p>
<p>Gary Cooper is the shyest star, he hates people visiting him when he's filming, if he has to, then he has to put on a very polite and courteous reception, making the guests uncomfortable.</p>
<h3>Tyrone Power's Love History - Loved Eight Women in Four Years</h3>
<p>— Qing Hui</p>
<p>In Hollywood, no one can deny that Tyrone Power is a handsome and dashing, young and handsome man; he began mingling among women at the age of ten. After entering the film industry, he successively loved eight actresses in just four years; although he is now married to Annabelle, his past life can really be said to be very romantic. Now, let's talk about his love affairs:</p>
<p>Tyrone went on the screen at the age of twenty-two, initially playing a supporting role in French star Simone Simon's "Girls in Distress"; Simone liked him very much, and Tyrone's status was low at that time, so he was happy to socialize with the more famous actress, so he often accompanied Simone to travel, photograph, and swim; soon the two fell in love. Then, he successively co-starred in three films with Loretta Young, and the two had a very good friendship, often having parties, looking very close, and people said that they were a mature couple, but Loretta Young declared to the news reporters that he was just her best friend, and as for marriage, it was out of the question.</p>
<p>At this time, Sonja Henie began to become famous in Hollywood, Tyrone and she co-starred in a film, unexpectedly, during the production of the film, the two fell in love at the same time; this time it was an open love affair, dance floors, restaurants, skating rinks, his and her traces could be seen everywhere. It was once rumored that Tyrone had proposed to Sonja, but this was unconfirmed news. Later, Sonja went to various parts of the United States to perform ice skating, and when she separated from Tyrone, the two made a passionate kiss in front of the public. But soon news came from Hollywood that Tyrone had not only forgotten her, but was also in love with Janet Gaynor.</p>
<p>Tyrone's love affair with Janet was relatively long, and he and she always went to Hollywood parties together, and he and her were often seen dancing at the dance floor every Sunday. But when news reporters asked him when he would marry Janet, he always answered with career reasons. Later, for some unknown reason, the two quarreled, and although friends mediated, the cracks in their love could not be repaired. Janet had people who loved her, and Tyrone also began to pursue Fox's newcomer Arleen Whelan; however, he eventually gave up his ambition to pursue Arleen because of Arleen and Richard Greene's close relationship, and he was also a good friend of Richard, and didn't want to take the beauty of others.</p>
<p>Later, he was borrowed by MGM to play the male lead in "Marie Antoinette." Li Siliian Howard originally had the highest call for the role, but unexpectedly, Norma Shearer insisted on co-starring with Tyrone, which shows that Norma also had a good impression of Tyrone; in several passionate scenes in the film, her emotions can be seen. Perhaps because of the age difference, Tyrone said that he hoped that there would be no love affairs between the two. Therefore, their relationship also ended with the completion of "Marie Antoinette."</p>
<p>After leaving Norma Shearer, Tyrone began to fall in love with the new star Wendy Barrie, but it was very short-lived. Afterwards, the most important and memorable thing in his life came, originally Tyrone saw Annabelle and felt that this French actress was lively and lovely; before long, during the filming of "Suez," his life history began to change, he knew that he had met his ideal partner, and at the same time Annabelle also fell in love with him, so his and her love quickly got success; although the company repeatedly tried to prevent it, it was all in vain, and he and she finally got married on May 25, 1939.</p>
