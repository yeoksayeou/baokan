<h3>遠東局勢日趨緊急　美總統決提前返京　赫爾哈立法克斯又作長談東條昨發表斥責英美演說</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯社三十日溫泉電　羅斯福總統昨在此間癱瘓兒童救濟協會發表演說、力言希望明年感恩節、各被侵略國民族亦能如美國人之慶祝佳節、末謂、美國陸·海軍校學童、他日實有起而保衛本國文物之可能云云、總統於發表此項演說後、即返歸私邸、當晚曾與赫爾國務卿通一長途雷話、交換頗久、事後總統即宣布於今日啓程返京、俾於一日午前趕回華府、一般人認為總統之忽忽言旋、殆與日首相東條所發之强硬演說有關云、</p>
<p>國際社三十日溫泉電　羅斯福總統今日突提前銷假返京、其原因似係係太平洋局勢趨劣、總統秘書吿新聞界稱、「日相東條在東京發表宣言」、指摘英美阻碍日本建立東亞共榮圈及開發遠東、國務卿赫爾以電話報吿總統、總統立即改變計劃、總統返京後、不久即宣稱、「我國海·陸軍學校之學生、明年將作戰、以保衛其學校、」</p>
<p>路透社三十日華盛頓電　國務卿赫爾昨吿新聞記者、非至日政府表示其對於日使所接美國公文之態度後、美·日局勢現無可言、記者詢以日本侵泰、將否引起太平洋衝突、赫爾對此不予答覆、僅謂宜詢諸海·陸軍部、赫爾昨曾與英大使哈立法克斯討論遠東時局約歷一小時之久、</p>
<p>路透社三十日東京電　日相東條發表一文、內有「運英、美在內之敵對國家現擬開拓東亞、不顧東亞十萬萬人之利害、為人類尊榮起見、吾人必須從東亞將此種行為掃蕩凈盡」等語、</p>
<p>合衆社三十日東京電　日相東條昨夜斥責第三國企圖干涉日本樹立「大東亞共榮圈」之計劃、並謂「不能容許他人干預此共榮圈」、渠稱「許多國家正從事對此共榮圈作敵對之行動、企圖阻礙吾人之途徑、而犧牲亞洲人民、搜括亞洲、以滿足其佔領之貪慾」、東條重申日本鞏固亞洲陣綫之决心、「俾勝利之歌可儘速奏於公道之營帳」、</p>
<p>路透社三十日倫敦電　日首相東條今日所發表之一文、及日本各報抨擊英·美之論調、巳减少太平洋中和平解決之希望、一般意見皆認局勢之危急與美國之接近對日作戰、從未有甚於今日者、星期日紀事報評述日首相之論文云、希特勒現正試圖勸誘日本代其火中取栗、俾可犧牲他國以遂其獨覇世界之野心、華盛頓與紐約傳來之新聞電訊、雖皆措辭幽鬱、惟對於太平洋立即發生衝突之可能性、則皆不以為然、星期日泰晤士報駐紐約訪員電稱、即使來栖決定返國、倘使同時並無其他不祥之行動發生、則亦未必即為談話巳完全破裂之謂、若干方面雖料危機巳迫、但仍有許多觀察家不主張對於最近未來之發展驟下斷語、</p>
<p>日報恫嚇美國謂將中止談判</p>
<p>合衆社三十日東京電　東京日文報紙本日警吿、如美國繼續其反動策略、增强太平洋ABCD國家之對日包圍政策、則日本不久將被迫退出華盛頓談判、彼時如有任何事故、皆應由美國負責云、中外商業新報評論警吿謂、如美國所提條件與日本之不變政策相反、則華盛頓談判將無滿意結束之可能、</p>
<p>合衆社三十日東京電　權威界稱、日本對美國最低限度要求太平洋調解之牒交之答覆、表示不滿意、包括若干未經宜露之基本要點、以前對於與美國成立協定之可能表示樂觀之人士、巳顯見　微、不協調之基本各點、並未予以透露、惟回憶美國嘗要求日軍退出中國及越南、並放棄其對軸心之聯繫、而保證維持現狀、以前非官方嘗言、美國對於遠東並非實際應付云、</p>
<p>路透社三十日河內　電華府消息、此間期待極殷、衆料七十二小時以內、定有關於美·日談話結果之切實消息、據一般猜測、所可成立者、殆為雙方省無所讓少、但可阻止遠東大戰發作之一種妥協辦法、越南日軍行動、尙未越過所允許之範圍、惟日軍確知泰國陸軍之軍事上與精神上力量、必使其離貳、而後進犯泰國、方不致大感困難也、惟可許軍事大活動之時節、今僅有三月、過此而後、則氣候又不利於行軍、大約美國關於休戰之任何辦法、當可使危險緩發一年、越南總督在戰事萬一發生時、定特予英·美人民以種種可能之保護、藍法·日協定僅為防守性質也、</p>
<p>美國態度堅決準備應付挑戰</p>
<p>合衆社三十日紐約電　前國務院顧問丹納特、昨向外交協會發表演說稱、日·美兩國素係天然同盟國、此後亦然、惟日本之「政治狂已改變美國之輿論、時至此際、吾人巳準備應付日本之挑戰、而將以一戰謀出路矣、」氏指出、美國之退出遠東政策、而以允許菲列濱獨立為其犖犖大者、渠云、「美國政策所以中途改變者、乃因日本之瘋狂暴力急進經濟政策所促成之、」又言、時至今日、美國將不許任何國家成立遠東之獨佔、是以來梄此次來美、係以窺探美人是否準備一戰為使命者、其返國吿知政府可也、讓其在橫跨太平洋時、記取曾向此間之友人道別、名作家名記者兼辦日本廣知時報編輯之弗列斯氏、亦在同一午宴席上發表演說稱、「日本一如前此希特勒之製造但澤藉口以進攻波蘭、故行將見日本之第二步驟將促成太平洋大戰、日本所欲反攻者、非為泰國或其他任何特別地點、而為日本廣泛之侵略政策、」又言、美國現時與日本接近戰爭、較歷史任何時期為甚、余信日本現如進一步侵入南太平洋、則吾人當絕不猶疑、將以武力加以制止、氏並猛烈抨擊日本軍人、謂「彼等控制日本之命運、惟不能瞭解原則、條約及主義之言詞、時代雜誌·生活雜誌·幸福雜誌之主筆兼發行人魯斯氏亦抨擊日本之政策及目標、並盛讚中國為自由而戰、認為中國確實代表共和國或竟較世界各國為甚云、</p>
<p>合衆社三十日倫敦電　今日英國各大報標題多為「美·日巳臨戰爭邊沿」、惟若干社評則暗示該兩太平洋國家尙有成化協定可能、每日郵報稱、倘日本撤退其在越南南部之駐軍、則美國或可鬆弛其經濟之制裁、而同意日本在越南北都駐留小部軍隊、該報指稱、南太平洋及東南與東北亞洲之不侵犯互相保證、可以完成美國三個月美·日協定之計劃、英方之估計表示、日軍在法屬越南約八萬五千名、惟若干消息則謂十萬名、外交界之最佳推測為、日本特使來栖最少於短期內將留華盛頓、各報咸預料縱或談話勉强繼續亦將歸於失敗云、</p>
<h3>亞歷山大　發表演說　謂遠東危機達爆發階段</h3>
<p>合衆社三十日白勒克普爾電　英海相亞歷山大昨在慶祝戰艦週開幕致詞、警吿國人謂、日本巳接近可悲的行動邊沿、並謂、遠東危機巳在爆炸階段、渠聞「日本領袖謂日本正處於岐路、惟誰領彼等進入過去之境地乎」、渠復自答云、「彼等之軍人是也」、又言、「余信日本若干明哲之士巳深知岐路中之一端係減亡之途、余信日本領袖之一部份或將作較明哲之勸告、而不立即加入戰爭」、氏又稱、「日本如願與公正合理之方面合作、無人能否認該國將取得東方之光榮地位」、又言、日本決不能希望自希特勒手中獲得任何利益、義國與德國合作可為殷鑒云、</p>
<h3>德日在遠東　傳將密切合作　此舉或為危機結果民治國決聯合對付</h3>
<p>合衆社三十日華盛頓電　消息靈通界人士今日預測、德·日兩國將作更密切之合作、以驅逐英·美利益於遠東、觀察家認為美國現時方靜待日本對美國遠東基本太平洋立塲之答覆、德·日此舉或為太平洋危機之結果、衆認日本與軸心在太平洋合作、較接受美國條件認更有可能、此輩覜察家稱、日本如對美·日談判失望、則或將一反過去消極合作態度、而與軸心積極台作、、以充份之給養站及燃料庫供給穗國、俾納粹剽襲艦隊能在太平洋上維持一强大之艦隊、此項剽襲艦隊將襲繫英國航運、德國並將助日本切斷美國給養之運華、若干方面稱、無論日本有若何行動、美·英·荷將以聯合行動加以對付、殆已無疑、惟行動之性質若何、則仍為絕對之官方秘密、伊省民主黨參議員吉三德氏稱、渠自可靠之非官方獲悉、希特勒曾向日本保證、謂至明年二月時、可以龐大軍力助日、並謂至一月時、維希將被逼交出艦隊聽任德國調遣、渠言、渠信除延宕之和平外、美、日不能有所成就、又言、渠悉來栖此來、係希特勒所請來、旨在將美、日談判加以延宕、直至德國力能助日本侵略泰國為止，泰薩克斯民主黨參議員兼有勢力之參院外委會主席康迺萊稱、日本如進攻泰國、渠主張對日「加緊經濟壓力、茶且將吾國艦隊若干集中於南太平洋、俾保證吾人之權益不致損害、」喬治民亞主黨參議員喬治氏稱、渠信日本企圖「藉大言脫己於禍」、惟承認「戰事於緒東之前或將擴大至兩洋之上、時日將至、日本如不有所行動、將戰事擴至太平洋上、即將作合作之調整、」番治氏言、渠信美國之遠東立塲、「殆將大部份為經濟及商業性質」、惟英、美合作以避免戰爭之舉、「則或將超過經濟之範團」渠並稱、美國避免戰事擴展至太平洋、甚感興趣、而日本則殊不願在未從中取利之前任令蘇聯敗續焉」、</p>

<p>合衆社三十日華盛頓電　霍華德兩報紙有名評論家拉撥氏昨日撰文稱、美國負責官吏、刻正鄭重指斥日本正在包圍菲列濱、吾人因此在轄下區域建立防禦工事、此言乃因最高政府當局於上星期五謂日本侵華及越南、巳樹立對菲島馬蹄式包圍形勢之故、又稱、戰事一旦爆發、日本艦隊殆將集中於日本附近、而美國艦隊則將拱衛夏威夷、以資保護、因在夏威夷至新加坡之間並無充分之根據地也、克拉撥氏稱、美國之主要行動當為利用根據於菲島之潛艇及飛機大肆活動、或　將派飛機自菲島出發、轟炸日本、戰事勢將緩慢進行、繼續一、二年之久、最後勝利毫無疑問、是以日本是否　於讓戰事爆發、實至足懷疑、最大之危險厥為日本殆將作錯誤之估計、而墜入戰爭之中云，</p>

<p>社評日本動向的檢討　　自從上月二十六日美國務卿赫爾以美國基本主張的牒文交付來栖之後，日前所盛傳的種種疑慮與樂觀空氣巳一變而為緊張與備戰，一般見解都認為遠東危機的爆發殆巳無可避免。不過在當事者的美日當局，現均保持着極端鎭靜與緘默，所傳日軍卽行進攻泰國之說亦尙有待於事實的證明，這自然是一種暴風雨前夜的寂靜，但也未必不是多少還期待着萬一的轉圜，雖然在雙方都承認此種希望巳極微弱；更何况在各方面固多對於美國態度表現堅强而表示慶幸，但也未嘗不有人在切盼妥協之竟得實現。是以與其在此際對未來發展作過早的推斷，到不如就日本處境剖析其動向與利害，因為此際日當局之何去何從，無疑是來日局勢的主要關鍵。　　此際日本遭際的艱困，誠為明治維新以來所未有；在已往日本固也曾因不勝國際重壓而有所讓步，有如三國干涉還遼與華盛頓會議；不過彼時國勢方張，國本未動，以些須的讓步而避免了對外關係上的重大危機，其實到未必非日本之幸。現在四年久戰已耗竭日本數十年積纍的資力，國際環境的惡化又迫使其失掉了發展對外貿易與獲致國外資源的機會，這種情勢自然是日本向亞洲大陸從事擴展所促成，但在日方却又倒因為果，以此更不肯放鬆對亞洲大陸的控制企圖，以便用以抵償其對外經濟上所蒙受的打擊與損失。然而在經濟上日本在大陸的成就固不容作過高的估量，在政治上，其在大陸的未來命運還是一個待決的謎；有如實力空前堅强的納粹，一遇到領十龐大人力物資無限的蘇聯，閃電戰便立時失却效果，其在波蘭·法·比所迅速獲致的戰果也許將永不能在蘇聯境內重演，以實力遠不足以望德國項背的日本，面臨着與蘇聯同樣龐大衆庶的中國，其成敗利鈍之數，自非日方軍政當局所能得而把握。一年以前日本「革新分子大唱南進之論，而以中國物資不足供日需求為理由，其實又何嘗因四年作戰持久不決而表現的不耐。經過一度侈談南進之後，用志已分，視　亦紊，這對於「解決中國事變」的進行，絕不是無所影響的。自從近衛第二次內閣成立以來，日方銳意進行「國防國家」的建設，共竭力從事誠然不容否認，不過此際適値消耗重大的戰時，物資來源又遭受嚴重封鎖，卽使着意搜括，竭澤而漁，也無從滿足需求的標準。例如造艦問題，自中日戰事發生後，日當局卽嚴守秘密，不再公布，以是引起外間重大揣測；但是假如日本也像美國，在今年一年之中連續完成五艘三萬五千噸的主力艦，則當此國際大局杌隉不定之際，也許不會不公開炫耀以揚國威，並用以威脅英美讓步吧？日本目前的現狀，不獨不足與整軍經武的英美爭一日的短長，卽與中國相較，卽使雙方實力尙未達到平衡，但是消長異趣，氣象懸殊，亦復不能同日而語。　　日本自身情况如此，自然不足以敵ABCD在遠東實力的總和；而另一方面，日本只是處境艱困，有遭遇失敗可能，但却尙未遇到重大失敗的挫逆，是以劍拔弩張的氣勢依然，至多只肯作局部退讓，而不容對其擴展企圖作根本的檢討，而日本「國防國家」的建設程序則為此一氣勢所憑藉的張本。其實一旦戰禍爆發，日本豈有徼倖可言，連日盛傳在越日軍已準備對泰採取行動，日方又對滇緬路的安全準備採取脅迫論調，然而ABCD的包圍形勢又何嘗是進攻泰緬所能衝破？只是懸崖勒馬只能期之於大智大勇，絕非暴虎憑河者所能為力；十餘年來的日本內外政策一脈相傳，積重難返，卽使幡然改圖，只是舉手投足之勞，這大概還不是此際日方任何人所敢毅然從事的。　　現在遠東危機固已如千鈞一髮，至於危機爆發的形態則尙不容作過早的懸揣；目前情形英美自不致驟卽對日取軍事的攻勢，日本也未必冒昧立刻去進攻新加坡或佔領馬尼刺，那還都間隔着相當的距離。假如日本此次對美通牒的答覆果眞語氣堅決絕無退讓跡象，則此後越南半島的動亂，自然無可避免，而其主要對象，則必仍着眼在「解決中國事變」，因為只有在結束對華戰爭之後，纔能專心對付英美，而且打擊中國；亦卽所以打擊英美。英摩托化部隊　抵加班齊海岸　沙漠區又展開坦克戰德萊文斯坦將軍被俘　　哈瓦斯社三十日開羅電　中東英軍總部發表戰報稱、英國摩托化部隊巳開到阿希達比亞及班加齊間海岸、　　哈瓦斯社三十日開　電　英中東軍總部宣布、德國陸軍軍官萊文斯坦將軍、巳在里比亞前終被俘、　　路透社三十日開羅電　里比亞沙漠中又一坦克車大戰、自星期五日起即在進行中、其交綏之地、約距甘勃特西南二十哩、據英軍發言人稱、此次戰事仍如以前之劇烈、前散佈於沙漠地之德方祖克車隊、於星期五日淸晨集合、輔以義軍一師、當其向西前進時、英空　見之、即迎頭猛擊、未幾英方鐵甲隊趨前迎戰、星期五夜戰事猶未巳、英軍所包圍之索倫、奧瑪與萊齊三角陣綫中、有納粹坦克車兵三師、英軍司令部之日的始終在摧毀敵方坦克車、雙方死傷數、此間尙未接官塲報吿、就目前現狀觀之、雙方似皆無進退、德軍昨似有擴大杜白魯南空隙、俾主力軍隊得以突圍衝出、作總退却之象、但據今日消息、英軍漸合圍、戰事將有更趨兇猛之發展、過去二十四小時內、英軍與杜白魯克守軍之聯絡綫逐漸加强、此為里比亞戰局中之要點、英軍昨在哈米特以北奪獲一重要據點事、可見英軍會師由杜白魯克東南至萊齊之走廊今漸展開矣、波音式戰鬥機自里比亞攻勢展開以來、巳擊毀至少敵機四十六架、荷印以坦克車　祝英相壽辰　　路透社三十日巴達維亞電　荷印今日以重坦克車二、輕坦克車四、機關槍車二、慶祝英相邱吉爾之壽辰、荷印在其致英相報吿邱吉爾坦克車運動最初成績之雷中稱、邱吉爾為擁護公道與自由之領導人、英僑現開會慶祝、而美僑亦舉行集會、以其所捐集經費之半數、購置邱吉爾坦克車、歐戰叢談作戰兩年後的德國　　他又非常注意於建築，凡是德國營造的重要建築物，沒有一所不經過他核准的。貝魯特地方的新歌劇院於呈閱圖　之時，希特勒曾把休息室中的飲食部移至地下室。他解釋道：「我要在那裏看見衣服整飭的愛好音榮者。這並不是安放　魚和夾餡麵包的地方呀！」　　德國的統冶權，和希特勒自己一樣，亦巳發生變動，而由政黨移至軍人之手了。今日的德國巳是在軍事獨裁統治之下。戰爭開始以後，黨部的權力便逐漸消失，現在幾乎巳全部完結了。　　黨部中人，巳逐漸退出國家要職。宜傳部新聞股幹練主任卡爾布默巳忽然不見蹤影，據說「他的沒落是巳經確定了。」較小的領袖也深感處境的困難。赫斯出走宣佈後第二天早晨，警察僅在柏林北部，即巳逮捕了二十車的人，其中也有穿着制服的衝鋒隊員在內。　　我曾屢次聽說，德國人，即在經濟恐慌政治混亂的一九三二年和一九三三年中，也絕不願接受軍人獨裁的，軍人和其他反動份子因乃不得不擁護國社黨。他們這種方針確實不錯，因為自一九三四年起，黨中潛伏着的革命份子，巳被希特勒排除盡凈了。今日的高級將領，皆是沒有政治背景的軍人，其中不少聰明伶俐，勳章燦爛，禮節嫻熟，惟知對希特勒唯唯諾諾的人物。總司令部主任季特爾將軍Wilhelm　Keitel足為此等軍人的表式。他的頭銜和位置雖很動聽，但是實際上發縱指示的人則為希特勒。陸軍德司令白朗傑區將軍Walthervon　Branchtisch是季特爾和陸軍的聯絡員。各種軍令係由希特勒傳給季特爾，然後依次傳至白朗傑區及前綫各統兵將領。前綫最優秀的將領，大約要算李斯特Siegmund　List和羅美爾Krwin　Rommel兩人了。李斯特是巴伐利亞人，學識豐富，作戰方略，無瑕可擊。羅美爾常在戰鬥劇烈之際突出奇兵，使季特爾輩相顧失色。郁特爾和陸軍參謀長哈爾德將軍Franz　Halder則係超等戰略家，希特勒草擬詳細作戰計劃，常倚之如左右手　　海軍總司令賴穗爾上將，猶如陸軍中的季特爾，也是對於希特勒惟命是聽的。有時希特勒命令他以軍艦應戰，他便面現愛色，原來賴德爾是小喜歡犧牲一艘軍艦的啊。　　至於空軍方面，希特勒定下一般方略，而由空軍總司令戈林上將決定其細目。戈林很聰明的把空軍指揮的職務讓給他超羣絕倫的助手密爾契將軍Erhard　Milch，他殆可稱為世界上最偉大的飛將軍，據說他還是半猶太種呢。　　軍官階級對於事態的演進莫不興高采烈。他們在德國幾同天之騙子，統制着機械化對建制度，四周都是優越的環境，精美的儀式和優良的生活。　　許多志氣高昂的靑年，都接受了德國陸軍的新光榮。假使他們是由中產階級出身的，還應當感謝上蒼，希特勒的陸軍至少比德皇威康時代的陸軍要民主化得多了。一九四〇年十二月某夜我與內人在燈火管制下迷失路途，承一下級軍官指示途徑。據他自述是一個窮苦靑年。又說，沒有「家庭背景」的人，平常要獲得委任，頗非易事，現在戰爭時期，却只要能表示領導的才能，和優良的成績，便不難得到委任。他當時很感煩惱的說：「我留在柏林，常與防空隊為伍，是何等的懊喪，若能到達前綫，一顯我的身手便好了。」他把所剩的啤酒一飲而盡，熱烈地說，一我們的前途是在陸軍啊！」　　赫斯的飛英，從種種跡象看來，係出於他自己的意思。他出走之時，雖得他人幫助，但顯然為希特勒所不知。他的飛英目的是在勸英媾和，與德聯合攻俄。　　赫斯飛英的前三日，德政府曾同蘇俄提出要求，請將小麥煤油，及其他物產，與以史多量和更迅速的接濟。赫斯在羅森堡之後，可稱為德國領袖中反共最烈的一人，他巳發見前途的危險。假使穌俄政府拒絕德方要求，他恐怕德國將陷入與蘇聯長期作戰的泥淖，正如日本的陷人中國泥淖一樣。假使蘇俄接受要求，他也恐怕兩國將日益接近，而使德國染上布爾什維克的色彩。　　赫斯常抱親英主義。據他的知交吿訴我，他相信對英作戰，未免不智，而常願英德聯合，組成反共十字軍以攻俄。當德蘇關係岌岌可危之時，他突然想到，假使他能與英國領袖面談，而吿以德國的對俄要求，也許會使他們明白過來。他的論據是：假使穌俄接受德國要求，德國即將對英發動更大的新攻勢，假使蘇俄拒絕要求，以致引起長期戰爭，或將使整個歐洲成為赤化。　　他估計的錯誤，是因他對於德國以外的世界見聞不廣，完全根據宜傳色彩的納粹觀念，以致扞格不入。就如他飛英時所選擇之目的地，即為一最好例證。他所以要飛到哈密爾頓公爵的采地，是因為他相信公爵在英，當然很具勢力，假使公爵和其他幾位貴族，對於他的主張能彼此相契，則使英政府與德媾和，必為一種輕而易舉之事。實則赫斯若知道英國的憎惡和畏懼國社主義，絞他們的憎惡和畏懼共產主義尤甚，必將為之目定口呆；他若知道個公爵不一定是握有大權的人，亦必將為之爽然若失　　德國報紙對於赫斯事件的處理，說他瘋狂已經一載，初看似乎手段太不高明。然而仔細一考察，便知道這是一種很有用意的舉動。他們實要利用赫斯事件做籍口，以排除黨內多數激烈派的勢力。（未完）巴黎德軍防舍　炸彈爆發　德兵二人斃命　　海通社三十日巴黎電　巴黎第十八區之德軍防舍內、昨有炸彈一枚爆炸、死德兵二人、當時所有地下車站均立刻關閉、所有街道亦於六時後停止交通、衆信該彈係恐怖份子所安置、　　路透社三十日柏林電　德方無綫電稱、巴黎德軍司令警吿民衆、每晚六時禁止宵行違者為巡邏德兵所見即予槍斃、而在炸彈肇事一設、則提早半小時實行宵禁令、所有各種娛樂塲所一律閉門、而各窗戶亦須關閉、前發特別宵行證暫作廢、北氷洋英潛艇　擊沉德船五艘　英海部宣布獲勝經過茂曼斯克德軍受打擊　　路透社三十日倫敦電　英海軍部昨夜宣布、在北水洋襲擊德方對茂曼斯克海上交通綫之英潛艇、又獲大勝利、據公報稱、德方運兵船與運輸船、載軍隊與軍需接濟茂曼斯克前綫之德軍者、頃遭北氷洋英潛艇痛擊、損折慘重、英潛艇蒂格里斯號放魚雷轟沉敵船五艘、軍創一艘、其中一次蒂格里斯號係襲敵艦多艘衛護之敵供應船三艘、而擊沉其兩艘、又英潛艘屈里頓特號襲敵運輸船與供應船七艘殊得手、其中三艘下沉、餘四艘受傷甚重或亦L損毀、該艇日用砲火擊傷第八艘敵船、被屈里頓特號轟沉之敵船中、有兩艘滿載軍隊、按該兩艘英潛艇前巳迭建戰功、蒂格里斯號係一○九噸之巡邏式潛艇、屈里頓特號甫於開戰前兩週造成、處女航時即擊沉挪威戰事中之第一艘德船李維諾夫　抵馬尼剌　　合衆社三十日馬尼刺電　新仟蘇聯駐美大使李維諾天、本日自新加坡乘飛機抵此、奎松總統將於下午八時設宴招待、李維諾夫稱、除渠自己一身之外、並未携帶仟何消息至華盛頓、渠拒絕討論戰事狀况、對政府各部會報吿　參政會提請注意點（續昨）　　水利　　　農田水利之灌溉及排水工程、為救濟農村之基本事業、係由金融界與地方政府投資合作、中央宜通知規劃、加强行政機構、充實資金、　水運部份應切實與公路及驛運各方面商取彼此聯繫辦法、以收水陸合作之效騐、均為水利事業之

<p>太平洋局勢與上海資金動向  李德明　　太平洋之局勢，目前進入最惡劣最危險之階段！姑以近日發生之下列數事觀之：　　　美國在華駐軍之撇退：美國駐華軍隊之此次撤退，並非此一千餘人單純之撤退問題，足以代表美國調整遠東政策之動向；如非日美關係　已瀕一種不可收拾之地步，則美國當局必不出此。　　　日美談判之僵局。美國巳以三原則交日本，即　日本退出軸心，　放棄南北進侵略，　撒退在華日軍，無論所　是否　實，但美總統一離京，足以表示美國對談判已無興趣，唯待日本之覺醒。以近年日本軍人之跋扈，冀其覺醒，恐非易事。談判停頓雖未必即戰之謂，但遠東局勢之嚴重，則又加進了一層。　　　滇越與泰越之形勢益緊：日本自侵佔越南後，即思染指泰國，此次日本企圖西進，截斷滇緬路，侵泰之心益亟，不論其侵滇侵泰，英美在遠東之最後防錢，均將遭受威脅，故絕無坐視之理。　　上海為東方之國際都巿，太平洋每一問題之爆發，均使上海現狀有改觀之可能。　　眼光遠大之民族資本家，果已有未雨綢繆而在妥籌善策者；但大多數仍昏昏瞶瞶，宛如樑上雙燕，沉緬酒色而不知烈火之將至！　　過去游資活躍　游資增加　　戰時今日上海資金之增加，其因有三：　戰區內資金之移入。　歐戰發生　昔日逃資於國外者之回流。　西南各口岸對滬貿易入超，據估計年達五、六萬萬元以上：此即大後方資金之流滬。　　據二十六年銀行年鑑所載，二十五年度全國銀行存款共四十五萬萬五千餘萬，因二十三年至二十五年之一年中，每年遞增約八萬萬　，　吳承禧氏曾依此推定二十八年全國之銀行存款為六十萬萬元，上海一處之存款，常在二十萬萬元以上，頃據申報所載，上海　　一家銀行二十九年止之存款總額，有如下表所示：　　存款類別　金額（元）　　活期存款　六四一、〇〇〇、五二三　　定期存款　一七二、七六六、九一〇　　儲蓄存款　七五、九〇四、八一二　　信托存款　三二九、六四五　　同業存款　一八、三五七、〇四六　　特別存款　　　二、三四五、　五〇　　其他存款　一〇四、二　五、一二一　　合計　一、〇二四、九〇八、一二一　　全滬收受存款之現有金融機關，何止百數十家，若合計之，則本巿存款總額之巨，自在意中。　　運用動向　　此種钜額資金之活動範圍，不外下列二大天類：　　　投資租界內新興工業：八一三以來，上海四郊，淪為戰區，所有工廠，大多燬於砲火，所存者限於租界內之少數，其後戰事西移，人口漸增，資金充斥，投資於工業者，風起雲湧，氣象之蓬勃，大有凌駕戰前之勢，其中尤以二十八年與二十九之上半期為全盛時代：據可靠統計：上海兩租界平均每日發電量，二十六年為五千五百十萬餘瓩，二十七年為四千九百四十萬餘瓩，至去年驟增為七千二百二十萬餘瓩，是該年度之發電量，不特較上年增加百分之四六，較前年亦增加百分之三一有奇，足　工商業之活躍！至於營業狀况，吾人可於上海銀行所發表之營業報吿中，錄其數語表示之：「凡經營洋貨之進口業者，如呢絨業，西藥業，五金業，紙張業，雜糧米麥業，棉花業等，在存貨方面，其價値已漲起兩三倍，獲利之豐，為近年來所罕有。紗廠業，布廠業等，獲利倍蓰，顏料業，洋針業等，莫不坐享巨利。其他如娛樂業，飲食業及各種公用事業，如電車，公共汽車等，均莫不營業猛晋，贏和逾恒。綜觀凡百各業，靡不欣欣向榮，全年間絕少倒閉淸理等事發生。　　　從事投機事業，新興工業雖蓬勃，尙不足以消納全部資金，故羣趨於投機，主要對象為：（甲）外滙：外滙為投機者主要對象之一，直至最近平準會實行管理匯巿成功，方受限制。（乙）金巿：亦為投機者對象之一，其價隨外滙之升降而起伏，因外滙變動之激烈，故金巿亦始終無寗日，今外滙管理奏效，故金巿投機之勢亦稍殺。（丙）房地產：戰後上海之人口，達五百萬以上，住屋求過於供，因之房價上漲，而投資於房地產者多矣。茲根據十一月二十六出版之金融商業報（Finance　and　Commerce）所載，今年一月至十月之房屋建築費與去年同期相較，有如下表：（單位元）　　區別　一九四一年　一九四〇年　　中區　三、五九五、九〇　一、七五五、四〇〇　　北區　四一四、一〇〇　一、九二〇、九四〇　　東區　一四、九〇二、四七〇　六、二九八、一一〇　　四區　三〇、四二四、二五〇　一四、七三八、六五〇　　合計　四九、三九六、七　〇　二四、七一三、一〇　　（丁）囤積居奇：戰後因本地之生產不足，而外來貨物，因交通梗阻，亦時有供不應求之勢，故囤積貨物者，無不大發其財。　　目前資金危機　　但今非昔北，丁業旣漸趨衰弱，而各種投機，亦漸近末路：滿則盈，極必反，誠為自然之理。　　工業衰落　　上海工業之黃金時代，在去年六月以前，六月以後，因：　煤炭之來源稀少，各工廠之電力供給，大受限制；　日人對淪陷區中之物質，加緊統制，同時英美及荷印等國，亦加緊統制原料之出品；　日人對於溫州寗波福州等埠，加緊封鎖，內地與上海之貨運，陷於停頓；　自去年六月以後，因生活費用日增，勞資糾紛，不斷發生。　萬一租界改觀，產權無法保持。由於上述四種原因，上海工業巳呈衰頹之勢。試將各業今日之情形，略述如下：　　紡織業：今年上半期各廠之產量，計棉紗較去年同期减少百分之五三，棉布减少百分之四五：外銷數量，棉紗僅當產量百分之八，棉布當產量百分之一八。　　染織業：近因染料價格上漲，各廠多感支持為難，目前開工者，僅及盛時三分之一而已。　　絲織業：本年產量月約五萬疋，較之去年約减少一萬五千匹毛。　　織業：自英澳限制羊毛出口，來源寥寥，因之生產大受限制。　　麵粉業：華商僅有阜豐與福新二家，阜豐已完全停工，福新亦已减少工作時間。　　捲烟業：華商中之南洋·華成·福新·大東等四大廠，月產四千箱，較之去年，產量减少三分之一。　　機器業：因美國備戰日亟，禁止生鐵出口，故華生華通玲　等廠，已减僱工人百分之二〇以上。　　化學業：因英美限制原料出口，德國之原料，亦因德蘇衝突，交通梗阻，全部斷絕。　　投機末途　　如上所述，投機對象不外外滙，黃金，及貨物三者。由外滙自平準會實行管理後，需要外滙者，均須向平準會申請，經平準會認為係人民生活所必需者，方可結滙；外滙買賣，旣有限制，外滙投機已不可能。黃金因外滙穩定，今後巿價亦不至再如過去變動之烈，以後投機黃金者，恐亦不如今日之旺盛矣。至於囤積貨物，自工部局統制物價以來，各種日用物品，皆已訂有限價，抬價出售，有于法紀，故以後之一般囤貨奸商，亦將無所用其技矣。　　故上海過剩之資金，今後旣不敢投資於工業，繼續投機，亦無利可得，則其出路如何？實為目前一般擁有資金者所最焦慮之問題。　　今後資金之出路　　中國政府近年對於西南之經濟建設，埋首苦幹，不遺餘力！不獨國營之企業，營業發達！即私人之廠商，亦獲利倍蓰！民國二十九年內地各種工業之產額，紡織業居首，為一，七六三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，化學業次之，為　，四三八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，金鑛業再次之，電氣材料業更次之，其餘則為其他各種之金屬　業，九月份之「遠東評論」（FarEastern　Revuew）載有詳細數字，今錄之如左。（　單千元）　　工業類別　金額　　紡織業　一、七六三、〇〇〇　　化學業　一、四三八、〇〇〇　　金鑛業　二八〇、〇〇〇　　電氣材料業　一八一、〇〇〇　　錫鍍業　一六四、〇〇〇　　　鋼鐵業　一二七、〇〇〇　　煤礦業　一一四、〇〇〇　　電氣業　　九九、〇〇　　機器業　六七、〇〇〇　　鎢鍍業　六五、〇〇　　食品業　　三九、〇〇〇　　銻鑛業　一〇、〇〇〇　　水銀礦業　五、〇〇〇　　銅鑛業　一、二〇〇　　其他金屬鍍業　二、五〇〇　　其他工業　三　一、〇〇〇　　合計　四、六九三、〇〇〇　　中國政府努力內地經濟建設之目的有二，一為增加戰時軍需器材之生產，二為增加日用物品之供給；二十七年一月成立之經濟部，即為促成上述二種目的之實現。經濟部成立後，一方以政府之資本，舉辦重要工鑛業，另一面則資助沿海沿江之私人工廠內遷，截至二十九年止，由政府資助而內遷之工廠，達四五〇所，搬運至內地之機器，達一一六，三七五噸，各業之詳細分配情形如下：　　工業類別　內遷噸數　　鑛鐵業　三七、二四二　　紡織業　三一、一一六　　機器業　一八、五八七　　化業業　九、七五六　　煤礦業　七、四五七　　電氣業　五、三七五　　其他業　五、八四二　　合計　一一六、三七五　　此外政府對於私入投資內地，又先後訂有獎勵辦法多種，其主要者計有：　工業獎勵辦法：二十七年六月七日公布施行。　特種工業保息及補助條例：二十七年六月七日公布施行。　非常時期工鑛業獎助暫行條例：二十七年十二月一日公布施行。　經濟部小工業貸款暫行辦法：二十八年二月十五日公布施行。　　今年十月二十八日，行政院又有「非常時期獎勵資金內移興辦實業辦法」之通過，不日即可公佈施行，全文共十四條，對於資金之投放內地，規定各種獎助，保息以及津貼等辦法，可謂無微不至！因之在過去四年中，內地之工業，突飛猛晋，截至目前止，已在內地各省建立工業中心十五處，資本在一萬元以上以及僱用工人在三十名以上之各種工廠總數，計有下列一，三五四所之多：　　工業類別　工廠數目　　機器業　三三　　金屬鑛業　九三　　電氣業　四七　　化學業　三六一　　紡織業　二八一　　其他業　二五九　　合計　一、三五四　　上海之前途，旣因太平洋風雲緊張，而日趨惡劣；而各種工業以及投機事業，亦巳無利可圖；今後何去何從？不言而喻。物價的歸宿  夏燃筆記　　我們常常聽到父老們談到若干年以前貨物的價格是多麼便宜，油一斤祇要十幾個錢，米一斗十幾個錢。我們聽了眞感到恨不早生幾年，可以享受許多廉價的東西。但把現在的物價和「八一三」前相比較，那末後生的幸運更壞，那時三毛錢可以吃到童子雞，現在三毛錢祇能吃到一個雞蛋；現在一担杜米　百元，以前可以買到　口很好的棺材；現在睏一口棺材，過去可以造一座洋房了。目前物價　動之快，簡直無法形容，商店老闆們連變更標價都來不及，只好把較貴的物價標籤放到次等的物品上去，例如把毛巾的標價放到襪子上去，襪子的標籤放到手帕上去，或放到牙膏牙刷上去。　　物價的高漲，根據經濟學原理應該是：供給增加，需要也增加，物價不加：反之需要增加而供給减少，物價就上漲。供給和需要旣然是物價變動的要素，那麼讓我們先來硏究這兩個問題。上海物資的供給是由　進口　本地生產　本地原有的存貨所構成的。最近三四年來進口貨物，並沒有减少，生產方面，租界外的工廠雖遭砲火所毀或被接收，但租界內的新工廠開了很多，且把工時由十二小時增到二十小時。存貨數量更為可觀，我們可以看到沿着蘇州河一帶的倉庫堆棧都填塞得滿滿的，甚至私人的住宅也儲藏了許許多多的貨物，房租也因此大貴。供給方面旣然還這樣增加，為什麼物價還是不斷上漲呢？原因在於他們的進口，生產，目的都是為着要期待善價而估，換句話說他們是為要賺大錢，才生產，才進口才囤積，所以這種供給的目的猶在希望漲價。　　再看需要方面的情形是怎樣呢？依經濟學原理是需要增加，供給不變，物價就會上漲。需要可以分為兩方面說：第一是消費，第二是囤貨。上海巿民的實際消費，因為近來物價高漲，是相當减少的，囤貨需要則反大增。囤積的猖獗，何以沒有辦法制止呢？也許就因上海的經濟是建築在自由主義經濟制度之下吧？因之操縱，抬價，賺錢都是應有的自由了吧？　　除了以上所說的供需關係之外，還有點政治影響。自國軍　撒，上海就變成淪陷區—孤島。同時又微妙地變成中日雙方的倉庫，中日兩國物資缺乏的時候，都　給於上海，這樣需要競爭的結果，就使物價高漲。……（中略）……　　不能忽略的另一個原因，就是日人對淪陷區物咨的嚴格統制，例如皮是絕對不准運到上海來的。有一個笑話說一個華人帶了一些破舊的衣服來滬，衣服包裏有一件皮的長袍，當被日兵看見時，就被抓到警局裏去詢問，警員問他這是什麼皮，他不諳日語，隨便說這是狗皮，警員從來沒有聽見過這種皮的名稱，把皮貨名單查了一查，沒有狗皮在內，以為不在禁止之列，就放他去了。……（中略）……淪陷區貨價的高漲。……（中略）……「路費」是一大原因，他們要把種種支出甚至把吃耳光的損失都轉嫁到貨物上去，這樣貨特安得不貴？淪陷區貨物貴，上海商人也就跟着抬。此和自由中國也就發生同樣的循環。　　依貨幣價値的原理說：生產和消費不變，如果貨幣或通貨的數量增多。貨幣單位的購買力當然跌落，於是就形成物價上漲。這裏我們可以把貨幣比做樓梯，物價比做一個小孩，如果樓梯的高度有限，小孩攀登的高度也是有限。不過現在却是物價見　，通貨才增加，如果小孩哭着要再登高，必須把梯加造幾層。但現在上海法幣不能自由運進，上海的通貨如何會增加呢？這是因為銀行對於投機商人，可以用貨物來抵押借款。商人把抵押借來的錢再行購貨囤積再行抵押。這樣一來商人可以無限制的投機，銀行通貨也無限制的膨脹。（未完）</p>

<p>春秋大腿上在流血了  無為　　有一位朋友常常說，看美國出版的圖畫雜誌，好像到電影院裏央看影戲。從引人入勝的封面翻起，簡直每一頁上都是新奇可喜的東西。當然，你對於西方物質文明的享受，如果有過人的需要時，你的興緻也就格外的高了。　　看呀！一九四二年的新型汽車……新型無綫電收音機……新型手提袋……烘土司器……自動調節電器咖啡壺……電氣鬚刮……什麽都好，什麽都叫人心愛。　　可是在最近接到的一期「生活」雜誌中，忽然發現了幾張彩色精印的女人挿圖！當然身材苗條，好像電影畫報裹的女明星一樣，尤其是那兩條大腿，不知要陶醉多少人！那大腿上却流着許多血，看她們的玉容沒有一個不是雙眉緊鎖，說不出的一股愁苦呢。鮮紅的血，雪白的綳帶，眞够叫人受用。　　後來仔細一看，原來是幾幅關於急救的圖片。敎導讀者在遭到空襲或其他意外時，對於受傷者，應該怎樣去做第一步的急救工作。　　眞想不到在如花如錦的美國的圖畫週報中，會有這樣可怕的畫面，挿入了這種煞風景的題材。美國已一步一步的走近了火藥庫，太平洋上最不太平的一頁，恐怕就要翻到。　　美國第四聯隊離滬之日，凄風苦雨，大家有不勝黯然惜別之感。然而我們總還覺得戰事或者不至於就在眼前爆發，至少還要經過一陣樽俎的折衝呢。可是我們看到了這畫報中女人大腿上流血的畫面，倒不能不說這車情有些難以想像了。至少我們可以斷定，美國人這一次所下的決心，恐怕不是僅僅的「玩玩罷了」吧！生活圈裡一個「嚮導女」在一天中  周玲玲　　是下午二點鐘光景了，老關娘娘叫：　　「玲玲，快起來，×宮四〇叫剛剛來電話找你去！」　　剛倒下床還沒有四五個鐘頭，就祇好起來。　　「快一點，快一點！」　　兩脚不自然地，但又習慣地跑向板壁旁，順手拿了件掛着的特為我定製的花印度綢的旗袍。（因為我們社裏有着十四個姊妹，但旗袍却只有十件，大家輪流着穿換。沒有生意的姊妹就躭在社裏不用穿了。而我是個一紅二點的人物，所以，老闆娘就特別待我好，允許我可以穿特別漂亮的服飾。）　　剛穿上旗袍，抬頭望了牆上的時鐘，巳經二點半了。雖然老關娘在催着，但塗脂抹粉的時間，却是特許的。　　一切做好了，肚子却感到「空空如也」起來，怕老闆娘動火，不敢開口，可是肚子餓，總沒有辦法呀。　　「姆媽，有啥末吃哦？肚皮餓來！」為了表示親熱點，老闆娘收了我做「過房囡」，可是，却引起了姊妹淘裏的妒忌和仇恨。其實，我是明白的，老闆娘是為了我長得有幾分討人歡喜，可以多為她賺幾個錢。　　可是，今天，出乎意料的「過房娘」却會像哄騙小孩子似的：　　「一眼嘸啥，玲玲，去罷，客人面前嗲一點，去多弄點東西吃吃，去罷，去罷，快點！」說着，把我推推拉拉的送了出來。　　脚跨下樓梯，心裏老大的不高與，加上身體的支撑不住，就把要帶的一包「大英牌」香烟給忘了。差不多過了一段路，又回頭來拿。因為香烟不帶去，那末旋館裹的「茶房老爺是會哼哼，對不起，「擋駕」的了！」　　這成了已定的規矩。　　坐上黃包車，才算直拉上「×宮」去。　　出電梯，走上「西四樓」。在門上輕輕的扣兩聲。　　「來」　　「此地阿有電話到××嚮導社去過？」　　「噢！有有！」一個胖胖帶眼鏡的先生，把頭略略向下低一低，眼睛睜得像桂圓珠一樣大，「你是不是周玲玲？」　　「是的！」我把頭往下一沉，眼睛向桌上的四個「客人」瞟了一眼。　　「來，來，來」那位胖胖先生向我招招手。「坐在我身邊」，看我打牌，噢！」像叮嚀他孩子似的。　　說罷，把我一拉。　　「喂章校長，當心點，勿要拿牌兜錯脫仔！」對面的西裝朋友在調笑着。而這位校長先生却益發得神起來，他動手動脚地……心上雖然像針刺一般的難受，可是在面孔上却還得裝出笑臉來忍受。耳朶裹還送進來帶着荒淫的笑聲。　　忽然，他很自然的，用着很快的速度收回了他的那隻毛手，去把一副牌推倒了，說是「辣子！」三百和」。　　他們賭的是「洋鈿么二」，張校長自己做「頭」，一副牌進賬就是國幣　百元正。　　順手，他給了我五塊錢的一張鈔票，說是我的「運氣」好，坐在旁邊，幫他和了副大牌。　　這是機會，我隨即又向他多要點「喜錢。」　　「好，再給你五塊，不過有個倏件，要唱一隻「四季相思」給我聽了，然後，再給你錢！」　　沒有辦法，只得唱。　　總算不壞，不到半小時，十塊大洋到手了。　　四圈完了，又是四圈。我也就跟着强胖校長，到徐律師，到西裝郭先生，再到個不大喜歡說話的鬍子先生那裏，輪流着服侍過去。　　共計兩小時，每小時兩元，在抽的「頭錢」裏給了我四塊錢，再給「小賬」兩元，我謝了聲，離開了這房間。　　走出了旅館，急需修理一下「五臟殿」。跨進一家糕　舖，叫了一客「春卷」，再來一碗「過橋」的鱔糊麵，化了近三塊錢的代價，總算塞飽了肚皮。　　回到社裹，交去了四塊錢的賬。　　等不到二十分鐘吧！又有電話來叫我了，這是一位張少爺，我最熟的「客人」。　　到金×飯店，伴着張少爺進了晚餐。其實，我已經吃不下了，只渴了一杯牛奶。　　時間還早，就決定到隔壁「金都」去買了兩張「艷屍」的票子。　　到「金×舞廳」是九點半光景，這一整夜，也就在「擁抱」與「蓬尺」聲中過去。　　東方微微有點發白，張又要我伴他到旅館去。　　我跟着去。因為在從旅館裹是有「跑棧房」，現在這門生意已經收掉了，一切都改名，於是到了戒嚴以後，便專做本棧房的生意　　叫做「包天亮」，有時兩點到六點，算四塊或五塊錢，就供人們去玩弄着。　　總之，老闆娘她有一個導女，就要照「牌頭」。至於死活，那是不管的。而我們的生活，也就在這樣的情景中過渡着！上一月廿九日記在淚水中。現在=以前  蘇公　　現在一顆煤球，以前一隻鷄蛋；　　現在一隻雞蛋，以前一升白米；　　現在一石白米，以前一具棺材；　　現在一具棺材，以前可以蓋一幢洋房了。女靑年會寒衣義賣　—參加這有意義的服務工作—  海文　　西北風起了，在街頭，在街口，每天都有凍僵的屍體發現。　　根據本報在月前的報吿：一九四〇年上海共收埋兒童屍體二萬零七百　十具，今年九月份計收兒童屍體一千一百八十六具，預料到十二月份將增加至百分之五百，就是一個月內將增一萬零九百三十具，一年就有十三萬一千一百六十具兒童屍體，這一驚人的數字報吿，很具體的給我們看到，在這孤島上，有多少無辜的兒童們是在這殘酷的環境裏被摧殘了！　　基督敎女靑年會，最近為了要拯救這一羣無辜的孩子們，發起了一個寒衣義賣運動，同時又召集了會員及失業女工，每天在該會所趕製寒衣，專來救濟貧苦的婦孺。　　孤島上，到處表現着一種矛盾的現象，一面有凍着餓着的人，但在另一面也有很多太太小姐們，躱在設備水汀火爐的洋房裏在閒着沒事做。但在這非常時期的中國，需要我們去做的事情實在是多得很，她眞需要我們每個國民拿出全部的精力貢獻着。雖然，處在這特殊環境的孤島上，我們所能做的事情果然是有限，可是現在擺在我們眼前的這一件逼切需要做的事情，希望大衆能有力出力有錢出錢的負起一份責任來秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　十五　爸爸，賣唱去吧！　　「別太客氣了！」張銀財也笑着向梅寶抱了一抱拳，他臉上那一對金魚眼，今天似乎也不像往常那樣的可怕了。「老吳，你安心歇息吧，我這個人就是性子躁，說話粗，心裏却也懂得好壞：你是個好人，現在更是非常可憐，祇要有什麽事可以給你幫忙的，我決不推托，連這樣跟我客氣也是多餘的！」　　秋海棠聽他這麽一說，不由連帶想到了幾個月前，自已才進紅舞台時，張銀財那一副盛氣相向的情形，禁不住就在枕上好笑起來。　　「可是，老吳，你這是內傷，武行飯千萬不能再吃，過一天快托人向小老板提一提吧！」當他低下了頭，快將跨出門去的時候，又特別找上了幾句。　　這幾句話在張銀財原是好意，但秋海棠聽了，却老大不快；他知道張銀財今兒這麼一來，自已向梅寶騙的一篇謊話便全部拆穿了。（二七六）</p>

<p>家庭家政討論會  益　　不久以前，報載某聞人夫人，為提倡節約，厲行新生活起見聯合婦女界志行高超的同志，已組織「家政討論會，」如入做會員的，須嚴守「不打牌」，「不吸烟」，「不作無謂應酬」的信條，並力行節約。　　這的確是一個値得欽佩的舉動。打牌，吸烟，時常作無謂的應酬，使家事不上軌道，兒童無人敎育，而做丈夫的又往往在外面胡鬧。　　我們很希望這一個「家政討論會」，對於中國家庭中的缺點，一一加以討諭，並日擬成改良的方案，使一般家庭，可以按照着實行。　　有一部份人以為女子討論家政，並不是一件最重要的事。然而如果每一個主婦，能够把一個家庭處理得井井有條，不但在經齊方面，可以更為穩定敷裕，而且還可以影響丈夫和兒童，因為當丈夫能够在家裹享受優美的家庭生活時，他決不願再到外面去消磨時間，而一個家庭中的經濟，非常充裕以後，做丈夫的也就不必去從不正當的地方增加收人了。　　同時兒童的在完善的環境裏長大，可以養成優美的性格，造成有用的人才。　　實在的，一個家庭的是否合理，大半要依靠着主婦對於家政方面適當的設施。坐墊與檯毯  萃芳　　在光綫明亮的屋子裏，坐墊與檯毯，這是候可以用純黑色的。假使嫌純黑色太暗，那麼不妨用深藍色的。　　製作坐墊與檯毯的質料，無論軟緞或者府綢，都可以應用；軟緞比較光亮，府綢比較經久。　　製作的圖案，第一種是團龍，第二種是楓葉；前者富麗，後者典雅；前者可以從秋季一直舖設到新年，後者是最切合目前節季的點綴。　　刺繡方法—先把這裏的圖案放大，繪在紙上，然後襯了一張紛紙，敷在黑緞上，把圖案勾　到黑緞上去。其次，把黑緞綳在喇繡用的木框上，先用金　勾出團補或楓葉的輪廓，再用金黃色的絾綫，塡滿空處。如果不用絨錢，用繡花用的絲綫或花綫也可以。　　用金綫勾出圖案輪廓的方法—取余綫二根，並行地按在圖案的輪廓上直，隨時用小針穿上了淡黃色細絲綫，把金綫縫牢在黑緞上。　　不用金錢的方法—這方法比較更簡便，做成以後，圖案好像是用印色的紙版印刷出來的。我的家庭問題徴文揭曉之九　好賭的母親  筱麗　　我的父親已去世九年，也沒有兄弟，兩個姊姊都巳出嫁。所以家中祇母親和我兩人。我在一個私人診所裏工作，不過所得酬　，祇够作為我個人的用度。經濟的來源，是憑籍父親所遺留下的微薄的產業。　　依情理，這樣母女倆是應該依為命　的生活着的。可是，不幸得很，事實並不如此。母親嗜賭，我却恨打牌，母親厭　我暇時看書，我却非此不行。因此，我們母女之間，竟是格格不入。　　每天早晨，把家事做完，趕着上診所，中午在診所吃飯，晚上帶着疲乏的身子回到家裏。照例，母親在牌局上，飯在米桶裏，早上買的菜也仍在籃裏，我也不用關心她的午餐，好在那自有里弄口的飯館來供給。這樣廢寢忘食的賭，經常地輸。我眞不知道如果把這些僅有的薄產用完了，將怎樣維持以後的生活。偶而對她諫勸幾句，便對我怒目相向，數說我如何不孝，說話多無理……剌刺不休。　　我過着這樣的生活，我的精神無所寄托，我希望能結婚，我需要愛的滋潤和慰藉。　　現在，對象是有了，那是幼年的同學，他一切都使我滿意，可是他是一個有老母弱弟需要負擔的人。不合母親招贅的條件。今年暑期，他大學畢業了，他說我們該有一個「切實的表示。」這話我怎樣回答好呢？雖然我很歡喜他，但決不願離間他們母子兄弟間的感情。一方面，母親又少不了我。所以對於這事，我想祇有犧牲自己了。　　我感到沒有結婚的可能。即使以後能再遇到合意的人，未必就能適合母親的條件，即使可能，自己却又不願別人為我受累——至少有這樣一個暴躁，貪賭，好享受的人生活在一起，家庭一定不會融和健全的。所以，與其將來又要生問題，無寗現在，不要多此一舉。　　但是，老處女的生活和晚景，是够孤寂和悲慘的。並且更嚴重的是當靑春已逝，經濟却發生了恐慌，那眞不堪設想了。　　這問題縱橫的交織成一個網，把我深深地陷在裏面，煩惱，苦悶，無法解決。　　編者按，中國主婦的打牌的習慣，實在可以說是中國家庭的一種重大損失，像筱麗女士的母親，為了賭，竟對於自己的女兒，毫無情感。單憑筱麗女士的敘述，我們很難下一種確切的斷語，因為家庭間的事是最複雜的，這一個好賭的母親，是不是結婚以後就喜歡賭博的，母女間的情感，當然也不是有一天裏就變成格格不入的，而兩個已經出嫁的姊姊，對於這個母親，情感上怎樣，是不是，有勸誘她戒賭的可能。　　在筱麗女士所處的情境之下，決不是直接的勸阻可以奏效的，必須用情感去感動她，用方法去勸誘她，用別種她所愛好的嗜好去使她離開那賭博的魔窟，實在要用極大的耐心，恒心，而永遠不要灰心。　　至於婚姻問題，已有的情人，可以把實在情形吿訴他。未來的情人，不妨繼續尋求，而反轉來說，對於自己學問的充實，以奠定經濟獨立的基礎，也是刻不容緩的事，結婚是關係終身幸福極大的事情，値得鄭重考慮，一個女子而能謀經濟獨立，也　始不是一件為人欽佩的事。　　下期徵文揭曉：一個深夜不睡的妻子。　　附吿讀者：本刋每次發表在下期登載的徵文，都已將發表的文章選定，所以請不要把同一的題目來應徴，寗可另選其他題材。家事一得  崇穗　　煮飯火過烈，易遇焦臭，急取冷水一碗置鍋中，將蓋蓋好，少頃，焦臭之氣即除。　　將炭先浸於鹽水或冷水中，燃燒時，可省一倍。　　若以細　布作小製，內盛芥子，浸入貯藏醬油　甕中，　醬油歷久不霉。一星期家常菜單  華英女士　　猪腸，又名圈子，老正興館的炒圈子，是頗有名的，愛吃肥腴的人，往往趨之若騖。這東西未嘗不可口，但是在洗滌時，必須洗得特別淸凈纔是。腸的做法，可紅燒，亦可白燉。紅燒的如要講究，可在圈子裏塞些糯米或肉末蝦仁之類；須燒得酥透，才覺入味。白燉須用糟滷，再加些鹹白菜冬笋片在內，吃起來津津有味，可說是下飯的妙品。　　星期一　　糟瀾圈子湯　　蟹粉豆腐羹　　靑菜炒綫粉　　海蜇蘿蔔絲　　星期二　　芹菜牛肉片　　豆苗炒蝦仁　　紅燒捲心菜　　霉菜菉豆芽　　星期三　　膠菜炒肉絲　　鰱魚炒豆腐　　紅燒蘿蔔絲　　京冬菜粉皮　　星期四　　番茄牛肉湯　　糖醋溜黃魚　　雪菜炒番薯　　油拌金花菜　　星期五　　菜心獅子頭　　蝦米蛋花湯　　菠菜燒豆腐　　油條黃豆芽　　星期六　　膠菜火腿湯　　薺菜炒蟹粉　　紅燒素　　　　葱花豆瓣沙　　星期日　　咖哩雞　　煎帶魚　　炒菜心　　炒蘿蔔天廚食譜（八三）（一四八）蟹粉燕窩  姚克昌擬稿　　　預備…蟹　燕窩　油　醬油　葱　薑　菱粉　　製法…隔夜把燕窩先用冷水浸開，第二天再把細毛等揀去，另取蟹二三只（不必過大）煮熟後剔出蟹肉，然後起油鑊，待油熱透，把燕窩蟹粉一同倒入煎炒，趁手加些醬油，葱屑？薑末等，起鑊前放些菱粉在內掉和之，一切製法，和炒蝦蟹粉等相同。（一四九）麵拖蟹  馮篤甫擬稿　　　預備…麵粉　蟹　葱　薑　醬油　油　　製法…把蟹洗淨後一切兩爿，即放在乾麵粉內按一按，再用油煎熟，如愛吃麵疙瘩者，須先把麵粉用冷水攪稀，再厚厚的塗滿在蟹之周圍，然後放入油內煎透，俟蟹外之麵粉發出焦黃色時箝起，另外潑些水，加些醬油等再略燒片刻，（在炰油時，把葱屑先投入熱油內煎焦，趁手撒些鹽，使油內發出一種葱花香味，再在攪麵粉時，不妨滲和些薑末，醬油精，鹽花及料酒在麵粉內同攪，）吃麵拖蟹時比較吃其他炒蟹粉等麻煩，因為再要剝蟹殼的緣故。諸君…如欲購買「味精」，「天廚醬油精液」，及　　　　　　　　，　　　　　四四五九四一，</p>

<h3>The Far East Situation Becomes Increasingly Urgent; US President Decides to Return to Capital Early; Hull and Halifax Hold Another Long Talk; Tojo Makes Speech Reproaching Britain and the US Yesterday</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Thermopolis, 30th – President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Polio Relief Association here yesterday, expressing the hope that next Thanksgiving, the peoples of all invaded countries could also celebrate the holiday like the Americans. He concluded by saying that the students of the US Army and Navy academies would have the opportunity to rise up and defend their national heritage in the future. After delivering this speech, the President returned to his private residence and had a long-distance telephone conversation with Secretary of State Hull that evening, exchanging views for quite some time. Afterwards, the President announced that he would depart today to return to the capital, in order to arrive back in Washington D.C. before noon on the 1st. It is generally believed that the President's sudden return is related to the tough speech made by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Thermopolis, 30th – President Roosevelt suddenly cut short his vacation and returned to the capital today. The reason seems to be the deteriorating situation in the Pacific. The President's secretary told the press, "Japanese Prime Minister Tojo made a declaration in Tokyo," accusing Britain and the United States of obstructing Japan's establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the development of the Far East. Secretary of State Hull reported this to the President by telephone, and the President immediately changed his plans. Shortly after the President returned to the capital, he declared, "Students in our army and navy schools will fight next year to defend their schools."</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 30th – Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that there was nothing to say about the US-Japan situation until the Japanese government expressed its attitude towards the US official document received by the Japanese ambassador. When asked whether Japan's invasion of Thailand would cause a conflict in the Pacific, Hull did not answer this, saying only that it should be asked of the Navy and Army departments. Hull had a discussion with British Ambassador Halifax yesterday about the Far East situation for about an hour.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 30th – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo published an article, which included the statement that "The hostile countries including Britain and the United States are now planning to develop East Asia, regardless of the interests of the 1 billion people in East Asia. For the sake of human dignity, we must sweep away this kind of behavior from East Asia."</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 30th – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo yesterday evening condemned third countries for attempting to interfere with Japan's plan to establish a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and said, "Interference with this co-prosperity sphere cannot be tolerated." He said, "Many countries are engaging in hostile actions against this co-prosperity sphere, attempting to obstruct our path, sacrificing the people of Asia, and plundering Asia to satisfy their greed for occupation." Tojo reiterated Japan's determination to consolidate the Asian front, "so that the song of victory can be sung as soon as possible in the camp of justice."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – An article published today by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, and the arguments of Japanese newspapers criticizing Britain and the United States, have reduced the hope for a peaceful resolution in the Pacific. General opinion is that the urgency of the situation and the United States' approach to war with Japan have never been greater than today. The Sunday Chronicle commented on the Japanese Prime Minister's essay, saying that Hitler is now trying to persuade Japan to pull chestnuts out of the fire for him, so that he can sacrifice other countries to fulfill his ambition to dominate the world. Although news dispatches from Washington and New York are worded in a somber tone, they do not believe that a conflict in the Pacific is likely to occur immediately. The Sunday Times correspondent in New York wired that even if Kurusu decides to return to his country, if no other ominous actions occur at the same time, it may not mean that the talks have completely broken down. Although some quarters expect a crisis to be imminent, many observers still do not advocate rushing to conclusions about the developments in the near future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Threatens the United States, Saying Negotiations Will Be Suspended</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 30th – Tokyo Japanese newspapers warned today that if the United States continues its reactionary strategy and intensifies the ABCD countries' encirclement policy against Japan in the Pacific, Japan will soon be forced to withdraw from the Washington negotiations. If any accidents occur at that time, the United States should be responsible, it was said. The Sino-Foreign Business Daily commented and warned that if the conditions proposed by the United States are contrary to Japan's unchanged policy, the Washington negotiations will not be able to end satisfactorily.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 30th – Authoritative sources said that Japan's reply to the United States' minimum demand for a Pacific reconciliation note expressed dissatisfaction, including some undisclosed basic points. Those who previously expressed optimism about the possibility of establishing an agreement with the United States have now visibly weakened. The basic points of disagreement have not been revealed, but it is recalled that the United States once demanded that Japanese troops withdraw from China and Vietnam, and abandon their ties with the Axis powers, while guaranteeing to maintain the status quo. Previously, it was unofficially said that the United States was not actually coping with the Far East.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hanoi, 30th – News from Washington is eagerly awaited here. It is expected that within 72 hours, there will be concrete news about the outcome of the US-Japan talks. According to general speculation, what can be achieved is a compromise that, although neither side is willing to make concessions, can prevent a major war from breaking out in the Far East. The actions of the Japanese army in Vietnam have not exceeded the permitted scope. However, the Japanese army knows for sure that the military and spiritual strength of the Thai army must make it disloyal before attacking Thailand, so that it will not feel too difficult. However, the season for permissible military activities is only three months from now. After this, the climate will be unfavorable for marching again. Roughly, any ceasefire measure by the United States will delay the danger for a year. The Governor-General of Vietnam will definitely give British and American people all possible protection in the event of war. The Lanfa-Japanese Agreement is only defensive in nature.</p>
<h3>The United States Has a Firm Attitude and Is Prepared to Meet the Challenge</h3>
<p>United Press, New York, 30th – Former State Department Advisor Dennett gave a speech to the Foreign Relations Association yesterday, saying that Japan and the United States have always been natural allies, and will continue to be so. However, Japan's "political madness has changed American public opinion. At this moment, we are prepared to meet Japan's challenge, and we will seek a way out through war." He pointed out that the United States' withdrawal from its Far East policy, with allowing the Philippines independence as its most obvious aspect. He said, "The reason why the United States' policy changed midway was due to Japan's mad violence and radical economic policies." He also said that today, the United States will not allow any country to establish a monopoly in the Far East. Therefore, Kurusu's visit to the United States this time is to explore whether the Americans are prepared for war. He can return to his country and tell the government. Let him remember to say goodbye to his friends here as he crosses the Pacific. Mr. Freiles, a famous writer, journalist, and editor of the Japanese-knowing Times, also gave a speech at the same luncheon, saying, "Japan, like Hitler before, is creating an excuse for Danzig to attack Poland, so we will see Japan's second step will lead to a Pacific War. What Japan wants to counterattack is not Thailand or any other particular place, but Japan's extensive policy of aggression." He also said that the United States is closer to war with Japan than at any time in history. I believe that if Japan further invades the South Pacific, we will never hesitate and will stop it by force. He also vehemently criticized the Japanese military, saying, "They control the fate of Japan, but they cannot understand the words of principles, treaties, and doctrines. Mr. Luce, the chief writer and publisher of Time Magazine, Life Magazine, and Fortune Magazine, also criticized Japan's policies and goals, and praised China for fighting for freedom, believing that China truly represents a republic, or even more so than any other country in the world."</p>
<p>United Press, London, 30th – Today, the headlines of major British newspapers are mostly "The US and Japan are on the Verge of War." However, some editorials suggest that the two Pacific countries may still be able to reach an agreement. The Daily Mail said that if Japan withdraws its troops stationed in southern Vietnam, the United States may relax its economic sanctions and agree to Japan stationing a small number of troops in northern Vietnam. The newspaper pointed out that mutual guarantees of non-aggression in the South Pacific and Southeast and Northeast Asia could complete the US plan for a three-month US-Japan agreement. British estimates indicate that there are approximately 85,000 Japanese troops in French Indochina, but some sources say 100,000. The best guess in diplomatic circles is that Japanese special envoy Kurusu will remain in Washington for at least the short term. All newspapers expect that even if talks continue with difficulty, they will fail.</p>
<h3>Alexander Gives a Speech, Saying the Far East Crisis Has Reached the Stage of Explosion</h3>
<p>United Press, Blackpool, 30th – British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, in his opening speech at the celebration of Warship Week yesterday, warned the people of the country that Japan was approaching the brink of regrettable action, and said that the Far East crisis was at the stage of explosion. He heard "Japanese leaders say that Japan is at a crossroads, but who led them into the past?" He replied himself, "Their soldiers did." He also said, "I believe that some wise men in Japan already know that one end of the crossroads is the road to destruction. I believe that some Japanese leaders will make wiser advice and not immediately join the war." He also said, "If Japan is willing to cooperate with the side of justice and reason, no one can deny that the country will gain a glorious position in the East." He also said that Japan should not hope to gain any benefits from Hitler. Cooperation between Italy and Germany can serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>It Is Rumored That Germany and Japan Will Cooperate Closely in the Far East; This Move May Be the Result of the Crisis; Democratic Countries Decide to Deal with It Jointly</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 30th – Well-informed sources predicted today that Germany and Japan will cooperate more closely to drive British and American interests out of the Far East. Observers believe that the United States is now waiting for Japan's reply to the United States' basic Pacific stance in the Far East. This move by Germany and Japan may be the result of the Pacific crisis. It is generally believed that Japan cooperating with the Axis powers in the Pacific is more likely than accepting the conditions of the United States. These observers said that if Japan is disappointed with the US-Japan talks, it may reverse its past passive cooperation attitude and actively cooperate with the Axis powers, providing the Axis countries with sufficient supply stations and fuel depots, so that Nazi raiding fleets can maintain a strong fleet in the Pacific. This raiding fleet will attack British shipping, and Germany will also help Japan cut off US supplies to China. Some quarters say that no matter what Japan does, the US, Britain, and the Netherlands will deal with it in a joint action, which is almost without a doubt. However, what the nature of the action will be is still an absolute official secret. Senator Geeside of the Democratic Party of Illinois said that he learned from reliable unofficial sources that Hitler had assured Japan that he could help Japan with a large military force by February next year, and said that by January, Vichy would be forced to hand over its fleet to Germany for dispatch. He said that he believed that the US and Japan could not achieve anything except a delayed peace. He also said that he knew that Kurusu's visit this time was requested by Hitler, with the aim of delaying the US-Japan talks until Germany was able to help Japan invade Thailand. Senator Connally of the Texas Democratic Party and chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee said that if Japan attacks Thailand, he advocated "intensifying economic pressure on Japan, and also concentrating some of our country's fleets in the South Pacific to ensure that our country's rights and interests will not be damaged." Senator George of the Georgia Democratic Party said that he believed Japan was trying to "get out of trouble by bragging," but admitted that "the war may expand to both oceans before the start of the war in the East. The day will come when, if Japan does not take action to expand the war to the Pacific, it will make a cooperative adjustment." Fan Zhi said that he believed the United States' Far East position was "mostly economic and commercial in nature," but the cooperation between Britain and the United States to avoid war "may exceed the scope of economics." He also said that the United States was very interested in avoiding the expansion of the war to the Pacific, while Japan was unwilling to let the Soviet Union fail before it could profit from it.</p>
<h3>Duff Cooper Returns to Singapore</h3>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 30th – British Cabinet Minister for the Far East Duff Cooper returned here today and will report the results of his discussions with the governments of Australia and New Zealand to London. British Deputy Commander of the Middle East Command, General Brehmer, also arrived on the same flight and will return to the Middle East after a three- or four-day stay.</p>
<h3>International Briefs</h3>
<p>Reuters, Nairobi, 30th – A public announcement said that there are still several military outposts of the army in the Gondar region of Abyssinia that have not surrendered. British planes have been dropping a surrender letter prepared by an Italian general to these outposts.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 30th – According to the US Customs statistics for October, the shipping industry in New York Harbor is still very prosperous, with a total of 546 ships sailing out, totaling approximately 2 million tons, of which 38 were foreign flags.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 30th – The Hong Kong branch of the Japanese Allied News Agency will suspend its communication services from tomorrow because Hong Kong has frozen Japanese funds and cannot obtain remittances from Tokyo.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 30th – According to news from Kubischif, the Soviet TASS News Agency issued a formal declaration this morning denying the claim that Britain and the Soviet Union had held negotiations before the outbreak of war on the Eastern Front.</p>

<h3>US 16th Naval District Announces Implementation of Blackout; If War Breaks Out, the US Will Send Planes to Bomb Japan; Singapore Cancels Soldiers' Leave and Intensifies Preparations</h3>
<p>United Press, Manila, 30th – The US 16th Naval District and its base, Cavite City, announced yesterday "an indefinite blackout." The city government approved the emergency decree proposed by the Navy and the preventive measures taken by the naval authorities. US Marines, sailors, and Philippine guards and soldiers, together with the police, are patrolling the roads to assist in the implementation of the blackout.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 30th – Reliable sources say that the Philippine army has now been incorporated into the US Far East Command and will soon be organized into three military districts. This area will not only include Luzon, but will also include the southern islands and Mindanao, where many Japanese people live. The organization of this force will be semi-independent to promote the highest degree of flexibility. The general impression is that the US preparations in the Philippines are progressing greatly and are sufficient to cope with any eventuality.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 30th – Mr. Rapp, a well-known commentator for the Howard newspapers, wrote yesterday that US officials are solemnly accusing Japan of encircling the Philippines, and we are therefore building fortifications in our jurisdiction. This statement is because the highest government authorities said last Friday that Japan's invasion of China and Vietnam has established a horseshoe-shaped encirclement of the Philippine Islands. It also said that once the war breaks out, the Japanese fleet will probably concentrate near Japan, while the US fleet will guard Hawaii for protection, because there is no sufficient base between Hawaii and Singapore. Mr. Kerabrappu said that the main action of the United States should be to use submarines and planes based in the Philippines to carry out large-scale activities, or send planes from the Philippines to bomb Japan. The war is bound to proceed slowly and continue for a year or two. Final victory is undoubtedly certain, so it is doubtful whether Japan will allow the war to break out. The greatest danger is that Japan will make a wrong estimate and fall into war.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 30th – Soldiers' leave was cancelled last night. Those in charge said that in view of the situation in the Pacific, this was a routine precautionary action.</p>
<h3>Japan Denies Attacking Thailand; British Troops Increase Defense of Rangoon</h3>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 30th – An official spokesman for the Ministry of the Army today absolutely denied the news that Japanese troops had already entered Thailand. United Press, Singapore, 30th – An official military spokesman announced today that a large number of British and Indian troops have arrived in Rangoon to increase defense. The newly arrived troops include various soldiers, and many of them have served on other battlefields. Last night, cinemas in Singapore suddenly showed orders on the screen ordering all soldiers to return to their camps immediately. After the troops returned to their camps, they were ordered to prepare, but authoritative sources expect the order to be revoked within 48 hours. The order is only a precautionary measure and does not include the Navy and the Australian Army. Regarding the rumors from London that Japan has already attacked Thailand, authoritative sources believe that this statement is still too early.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 30th – The Bangkok official radio station commented last night on the news broadcast by the American radio station that Japanese troops in southern Vietnam are preparing to invade Thai territory immediately when Tokyo orders it, saying that Thailand will not be attacked by Japanese troops, because Japan will guarantee friendship with Thailand.</p>
<p>United Press, New York, 30th – Last night, London rumored that Japanese troops had attacked Thailand. However, the British Foreign Office said that it had not received any information about the rumors. The extreme concern of Britain and the United States about the situation in the Pacific is already very obvious. The cancellation of military leave in Singapore coincides with the belief here that Japan may launch an attack somewhere at the end of this week. Unofficial sources in Washington said that Tokyo is clearly desperate, because Japan believes that the talks in Washington are on the verge of collapse. The sources said that Japan may launch an attack in an attempt to "break through the encirclement." American newspapers all headlined the crisis in the East.</p>
<p>United Press, Bangkok, 30th – Thai newspapers reported that the US embassy in Thailand has advised American expatriates in Thailand to prepare to evacuate in an emergency.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Announces Victory on the Southern Front; Red Army Recaptures Rostov; Four German Divisions Are Defeated; 5,000 Killed in Action; Threat to Caucasus Oil Fields Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th – The Soviet Information Bureau issued a special communique stating that several days ago, the German army suddenly occupied Zastov. On the 28th, our army, under the leadership of Limosov, crossed the Don River and broke into the southern part of Rostov City to fight the enemy. At the same time, the Red Army of Kalitov broke into the city from the northeast and occupied the city. As a result of the fierce fighting, the German 14th and 16th Tank Divisions, the 60th Motorized Division, and the SS 1st Division, a total of four divisions under the guidance of Christoff, have been completely defeated. The enemy army retreated towards Tannenbörg, and the Red Army is pursuing closely. 5,000 enemy bodies were left on the battlefield. Our army seized many spoils of war.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th – After the Red Army recaptured Rostov City on the southern front, it continued to advance. Fascist tanks and artillery units retreated in panic. Christoff, the famous German commander-in-chief on the southern front, also fled from Tagenrog to Marioppo. Our cavalry is particularly diligent in pursuing the defeated enemy army. In addition, the Red Army also achieved victories at other points on the southern front. The Soviet air force is very active. In the past 24 hours, it shot down enemy aircraft and destroyed 200 military vehicles carrying enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 30th – After the Red Army's great victory on the southern front and the recapture of Rostopff, Stalin has telegraphed congratulations to Marshal Dimoshchenko, the commander-in-chief of the southern front, Major General Chiriweizheng Guo, and the entire Red Army that contributed to the victory. In addition, during the Red Army's counterattack on Rostopff this time, the German army resisted fiercely, and the Red Army encountered many difficulties. The Don River was not completely frozen. The Red Army's tanks and artillery units did not participate. Only the infantry and cavalry attacked. After the Red Army broke into the south, it engaged in street fighting with the enemy for two days.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 30th – Soviet forces yesterday recaptured the city of Rostov on the Don River. In this astonishing counterattack, 5,000 German soldiers were killed in action, thus repelling the German threat to the Caucasus oil fields. Berlin military circles denied that Soviet forces had recaptured the city, but acknowledged that German forces had withdrawn from the important theater. The recapture of Rostov is the Soviet Union's first decisive victory since the German invasion began, and it is in marked contrast to the serious threat the German army has posed to the Don River area and Moscow in recent days. Baku will be a greater prize to Hitler than the Suez Canal, but unless the German army can retake Rostov and hold it securely, this gateway to the Caucasus cannot be occupied.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Headquarters of the German Head of State, 30th – The German Supreme Command announced today that the German forces and air force in Rostov and the Tangnaizi Basin cooperated and launched a major melee yesterday, causing the attacking Soviet forces to flee in disarray, suffering heavy losses. In the east of Taijilowan, the oil depot established by the Soviet army was breached, and German bombers dropped bombs to set it on fire. German infantry and tank columns attacked the Moscow area and seized a lot of food. The Soviet army on the Leningrad front, with the help of tanks, launched a powerful offensive, which was finally repelled by the German army. German bombers continued to carry out destructive work on the northern front. Important railway projects along the Maomansike line were destroyed. The airfields and railways in the southern and central lines were also attacked by German aircraft, causing heavy damage. Leningrad and Moscow were bombed during the daytime.</p>
<h3>Red Army Continues Counterattack and Crosses Volga River</h3>
<p>TASS, Karining, 30th – Our army continued to counterattack in the Karining area on the 28th. Fierce fighting raged throughout the night. The German army was driven out of several villages. Our army also crossed the frozen Volga River at several points. The Red Army teams of Stevepanov and Koloson Ge are both gradually advancing. On the 27th, the troops of Koloson Ge recaptured three villages. Although the enemy attempted to counterattack, they were still repelled. Our army captured a large number of German prisoners, who belonged to the 58th Regiment of the 6th Division. Their feet were frozen and they could not walk. In some areas, the enemy has gradually retreated. Our army continued to capture many important points.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th – Authoritative sources announced yesterday afternoon that Volokolamsk, a military stronghold on the Riga-Moscow railway line, had fallen into the hands of the German army. The town is an important intersection of the railway in the Moscow area, so it is extremely important militarily.</p>
<p>TASS, Crimea, 30th – In the Crimea, the enemy army continues to reinforce its offensive, and the threat to Sebasstopol is increasing. The enemy occupies important heights leading into the town. The Red Army, with the assistance of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, is firmly holding its position. Yesterday, the enemy army occupied a certain height and continued to capture an important point. The Black Sea Fleet bombarded the enemy army and also inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy in terms of manpower and materiel.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th – It was announced here last night that the German army, after occupying the port and resort of Bulaklava at the southern end of the Crimean Peninsula, had approached Sebasstopol.</p>

<p>Editorial: Review of Japan's Movements</p>
<p>Since US Secretary of State Hull delivered the American fundamental principles to Kurusu on the 26th of last month, the various rumors and optimistic atmosphere that had prevailed in recent days have turned into tension and preparation for war. General opinion holds that the outbreak of a crisis in the Far East is almost inevitable. However, the parties involved, the US and Japanese authorities, are currently maintaining extreme calm and silence. The rumor that Japanese troops will immediately attack Thailand has yet to be proven. This is naturally the silence before the storm, but it may also be that some still expect a chance for a turnaround, although both sides admit that this hope is extremely weak. Moreover, while many are pleased that the US attitude appears strong, some are also eagerly hoping that a compromise can be reached. Therefore, rather than making premature predictions about future developments at this juncture, it would be better to analyze Japan's situation and its movements and interests, because the course of action taken by the Japanese authorities at this time is undoubtedly the main key to the future situation.</p>
<p>The difficulties Japan faces at this moment are unprecedented since the Meiji Restoration. In the past, Japan did make concessions due to overwhelming international pressure, such as the Triple Intervention's return of Liaodong and the Washington Naval Conference. However, at that time, its national power was growing, and its foundation was not shaken. Making some concessions avoided a major crisis in foreign relations, which may have been fortunate for Japan. Now, four years of prolonged war have exhausted Japan's accumulated resources over decades, and the deteriorating international environment has forced it to lose opportunities to develop foreign trade and obtain foreign resources. This situation was naturally brought about by Japan's expansion into the Asian continent, but the Japanese side puts the cart before the horse, and is even more reluctant to relax its attempts to control the Asian continent, in order to compensate for the economic blows and losses it has suffered in its foreign relations. However, economically, Japan's achievements on the continent should not be overestimated. Politically, its future fate on the continent is still an undecided mystery. Just like the Nazis, whose strength was unprecedentedly strong, immediately lost their effectiveness when they encountered the Soviet Union, which possessed a huge population, abundant resources, and unlimited manpower. The war results they quickly achieved in Poland, France, and Belgium may never be repeated on Soviet territory. Japan, whose strength is far from being comparable to Germany, faces China, which has a population as large as the Soviet Union. Whether Japan will succeed or fail is something that the Japanese military and political authorities cannot grasp. A year ago, Japanese "reformist elements" loudly advocated advancing south, using the rationale that China's resources were insufficient to meet Japan's needs. In reality, they were simply impatient with the failure to resolve the "China Incident" after four years of war. After once extravagantly discussing advancing south, their ambitions were divided, and their vision became chaotic, which was definitely not without impact on the progress of "resolving the China Incident." Since the establishment of the second Konoe cabinet, the Japanese side has been determined to carry out the construction of a "national defense state" and has been working hard, which is undeniable. However, at this time, it is precisely during a period of major consumption due to the war, and the source of materials has been severely blockaded. Even if they deliberately search and exhaust all resources, it is impossible to meet the standards of demand. For example, on the issue of shipbuilding, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese authorities have strictly maintained secrecy and no longer publish information, which has caused significant speculation from the outside world. However, if Japan, like the United States, had completed five 35,000-ton battleships in one year, perhaps it would have openly flaunted them to showcase its national power and use them to threaten Britain and the United States to make concessions during this period of precarious international situation? Japan's current situation is not only insufficient to compete with the well-equipped and well-trained Britain and the United States, but even compared with China, even if the strength of both sides has not yet reached equilibrium, the trends of rise and fall differ, and the situations are vastly different.</p>
<p>Japan's own situation is such that it is naturally insufficient to match the combined strength of the ABCD powers in the Far East. On the other hand, Japan is only facing a difficult situation and may encounter failure, but it has not yet encountered a major failure. Therefore, its saber-rattling momentum remains, and it is only willing to make local concessions at most, and does not allow a fundamental review of its expansionist attempts. The construction process of Japan's "national defense state" is based on this momentum. In reality, once war breaks out, how can Japan expect to be lucky? It has been widely rumored in recent days that the Japanese troops in Vietnam are prepared to take action against Thailand, and the Japanese side is also preparing to adopt coercive rhetoric regarding the safety of the Yunnan-Burma Road. However, how can the ABCD encirclement be broken through by attacking Thailand and Burma? Only great wisdom and courage can prevent a fall off a cliff. Those who are reckless and rely on brute force cannot achieve this. Japan's domestic and foreign policies over the past decade or so have been consistent, and reversing the accumulation of errors is difficult. Even if they suddenly change course, it would only be a matter of raising a hand or lifting a foot. Perhaps no one in the Japanese side dares to resolutely undertake this at this time.</p>
<p>Currently, the crisis in the Far East is as critical as a hairsbreadth, but the form in which the crisis will erupt cannot be predicted too early. In the current situation, Britain and the United States will naturally not immediately launch a military offensive against Japan, and Japan may not rashly attack Singapore or occupy Manila immediately. There is still a considerable distance between these possibilities. If Japan's reply to the US note is indeed firm and shows no signs of retreat, then turmoil in the Indochina peninsula will naturally be unavoidable, and its main target will still focus on "resolving the China Incident," because only after ending the war against China can it concentrate on dealing with Britain and the United States, and attacking China is also a way to attack Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>British Motorized Units Arrive on the Coast of Cyrenaica; Tank War Resumes in the Desert; General Levinstein Captured</p>
<p>Cairo, 30th (Havas): British Middle East Headquarters announced in a communique that British motorized units have reached the coast between Agedabia and Benghazi.</p>
<p>Cairo, 30th (Havas): British Middle East Headquarters announced that German Army General Levinstein has been captured on the Libyan front.</p>
<p>Cairo, 30th (Reuters): Another major tank battle is underway in the Libyan desert, having been in progress since Friday. The engagement is taking place about 20 miles southwest of Gambut. According to a British military spokesman, the battle is as fierce as before. On Friday morning, the German Zouk units, which had been dispersed throughout the desert, assembled, reinforced by an Italian division. When they advanced westward, British aircraft spotted them and immediately launched a fierce attack. Before long, British armored units moved forward to engage them. The battle continued throughout Friday night. The British army is constantly destroying enemy tanks within the Solun, Omar, and El Adem triangle, which it has surrounded. The number of casualties on both sides has not yet been officially reported here. Based on the current situation, neither side seems to be advancing or retreating. Yesterday, the German army seemed to be widening the gap south of Tobruk to allow its main forces to break through and make a general retreat. However, according to today's news, the British army is gradually closing the encirclement, and the battle is expected to develop more fiercely. Over the past 24 hours, the British army's lines of communication with the Tobruk garrison have gradually strengthened, which is a key point in the Libyan campaign. The fact that the British army captured an important stronghold north of Halfaya Pass yesterday shows that the corridor through which the British army will join forces from southeast of Tobruk to El Adem is gradually unfolding. Since the start of the Libyan offensive, Boeing fighter planes have shot down at least 46 enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Celebrates British Prime Minister's Birthday with Tanks</p>
<p>Batavia, 30th (Reuters): Today, the Dutch East Indies celebrated the birthday of British Prime Minister Churchill with two heavy tanks, four light tanks, and two machine gun carriers. In its report to the British Prime Minister on the initial results of the Churchill tank movement, the Dutch East Indies stated that Churchill is a leader in upholding justice and freedom. British expatriates are currently holding meetings to celebrate, and American expatriates are also holding gatherings, using half of the funds they have collected to purchase Churchill tanks.</p>
<p>European War Anecdotes: Germany Two Years After the Start of the War</p>
<p>He also pays great attention to architecture. Every important building constructed in Germany must be approved by him. When the blueprints for the new opera house in Beirut were submitted for review, Hitler moved the refreshment area in the lounge to the basement. He explained, "I want to see well-dressed opera lovers there. It's not a place for sausages and stuffed bread!"</p>
<p>The power structure in Germany, like Hitler himself, has also changed, shifting from the party to the military. Today's Germany is under military dictatorship. Since the start of the war, the power of the party has gradually disappeared and is now almost completely gone.</p>
<p>Party members are gradually withdrawing from key national positions. The capable director of the propaganda department's news division, Karl Bomer, suddenly disappeared. It is said that "his downfall has been confirmed." Smaller leaders also feel the difficulty of their situation. The morning after Hess's defection was announced, the police arrested twenty truckloads of people in northern Berlin alone, including stormtroopers in uniform.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly heard that even during the economic panic and political chaos of 1932 and 1933, Germans were unwilling to accept military dictatorship. Therefore, the military and other reactionary elements had no choice but to support the National Socialist Party. Their approach was indeed correct, because since 1934, the revolutionary elements lurking within the party have been completely purged by Hitler. Today's high-ranking generals are all military men without political backgrounds. Many of them are intelligent, decorated with medals, skilled in etiquette, and only know how to obey Hitler. General Wilhelm Keitel, the director of the Supreme Command, is a typical example of these military men. His title and position are impressive, but in reality, it is Hitler who issues the instructions. General Walther von Branchtisch, the commander of the Army, is Keitel's liaison with the Army. Various military orders are transmitted from Hitler to Keitel, and then in turn to Branchtisch and the generals commanding troops on the front lines. The most outstanding generals on the front lines are probably Siegmund List and Krwin Rommel. List is a Bavarian with extensive knowledge and impeccable combat strategies. Rommel often surprises with unexpected moves during intense battles, causing Keitel and his ilk to pale in comparison. General Franz Halder, the Chief of the Army General Staff, is a first-class strategist whom Hitler relies on heavily when drafting detailed war plans.</p>
<p>Admiral Raeder, the commander-in-chief of the Navy, is like Keitel in the Army, always obedient to Hitler. Sometimes when Hitler orders him to engage with warships, he shows a look of love, because Raeder is a little reluctant to sacrifice a warship.</p>
<p>As for the Air Force, Hitler sets the general strategy, and Air Force Commander-in-Chief Göring decides the details. Göring cleverly gave the command of the Air Force to his extraordinary assistant, General Erhard Milch, who can be called the greatest flying general in the world. It is said that he is even of half-Jewish descent.</p>
<p>The officer class is delighted with the evolution of the situation. They are almost like heaven's chosen ones in Germany, controlling the mechanized construction system, surrounded by superior environments, exquisite ceremonies, and a good life.</p>
<p>Many ambitious young people have embraced the new glory of the German Army. If they come from the middle class, they should thank God. Hitler's Army is at least more democratic than the Army of Kaiser Wilhelm's era. One night in December 1940, my wife and I got lost in the blackout and were guided by a lower-ranking officer. He described himself as a poor young man. He also said that it used to be difficult for people without "family background" to get commissioned, but now during the war, as long as they can demonstrate leadership ability and excellent performance, it is not difficult to get commissioned. He said with great distress, "It is so frustrating to stay in Berlin and be with the air defense forces. It would be great if I could get to the front lines and show my skills." He drank the rest of his beer and said enthusiastically, "Our future is in the Army!"</p>
<p>Judging from various signs, Hess's flight to England was his own idea. Although he received help from others when he defected, it was clearly unknown to Hitler. His purpose in flying to England was to persuade England to make peace and unite with Germany to attack Russia.</p>
<p>Three days before Hess's flight to England, the German government had made a request to Soviet Russia to provide wheat, kerosene, and other materials in greater quantities and more rapidly. Hess, after Rosenberg, can be called one of the most vehemently anti-communist among the German leaders. He had discovered the danger ahead. If the Soviet government refused the German request, he feared that Germany would fall into a quagmire of prolonged war with the Soviet Union, just like Japan's entanglement in China. If the Soviet Union accepted the request, he also feared that the two countries would become increasingly close, and Germany would become tainted with Bolshevism.</p>
<p>Hess had always been pro-British. According to his confidants, he believed that it was unwise to fight against England and often wished for England and Germany to unite to form an anti-communist crusade to attack Russia. When German-Soviet relations were on the verge of collapse, he suddenly thought that if he could meet with British leaders and inform them of Germany's demands on Russia, it might make them understand. His argument was: if Soviet Russia accepted Germany's demands, Germany would launch a greater new offensive against England; if Soviet Russia refused the demands, leading to a long-term war, it might turn the entire Europe into red.</p>
<p>His miscalculation was due to his lack of knowledge about the world outside of Germany. He relied entirely on propaganda-tinted Nazi concepts, which were incompatible with reality. The destination he chose when flying to England is a prime example. He wanted to fly to the Duke of Hamilton's territory because he believed that the Duke must be influential in England. If the Duke and several other nobles could agree with his views, it would be easy to make the British government make peace with Germany. In fact, if Hess knew that the British hated and feared National Socialism even more than they hated and feared communism, he would have been speechless. If he knew that a duke was not necessarily a person in power, he would have been greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>The German newspapers' treatment of the Hess incident, saying that he had been insane for a year, seems to be a very clumsy tactic at first glance. However, after careful examination, it is known that this is a very intentional move. They actually want to use the Hess incident as an excuse to eliminate the power of the majority of radical factions within the party. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Bomb Explodes in German Barracks in Paris; Two German Soldiers Killed</p>
<p>Paris, 30th (Haitong News Agency): A bomb exploded in a German barracks in the 18th arrondissement of Paris yesterday, killing two German soldiers.

<p>British Submarine Sinks Five German Ships in the Arctic Ocean; British Admiralty Announces Victory; German Troops in Murmansk Suffer Blow</p>
<p>London, 30th (Reuters): The British Admiralty announced last night that British submarines attacking the German maritime transport line to Murmansk in the Arctic Ocean have achieved another major victory. According to the communique, German troop transports and supply ships carrying troops and supplies to the German troops on the Murmansk front were severely attacked by British submarines in the Arctic Ocean, suffering heavy losses. The British submarine Tigris torpedoed and sank five enemy ships and damaged one. In one instance, the Tigris attacked three enemy supply ships escorted by multiple enemy warships, sinking two of them. Also, the British submarine Triton successfully attacked seven enemy transports and supply ships, sinking three of them and severely damaging the remaining four, which may also have been destroyed. The submarine also damaged an eighth enemy ship with artillery fire. Among the enemy ships sunk by the Triton, two were fully loaded with troops. Both British submarines had previously achieved numerous victories. The Tigris is a 109-ton patrol submarine, and the Triton was built just two weeks before the start of the war. It sank the first German ship in the Norwegian campaign during its maiden voyage.</p>

These are fundamental facilities for water conservancy and should be effectively planned and implemented in a comprehensive manner.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Social Affairs has been proceeding with various matters related to the resolutions of the First National Congress of the PPC, and other plans and measures are also targeting actual needs and achieving considerable results. However, there are still several matters that require serious attention:</p>
<p>Regarding social administrative agencies, the government should urge provinces and counties with sufficient financial resources to establish social affairs departments and social affairs sections as early as possible, so that social work can be developed early. The cooperative business administration offices in each province should be placed under the jurisdiction of the social affairs departments to rationalize the system.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization and training of the people, the government should assist in the establishment of people's organizations and professional organizations, strengthen their organization, and also supervise their improvement and strengthen their control, so as to ensure both quality and quantity, and healthy development.</p>
<p>Regarding social welfare, although agricultural and industrial welfare undertakings have already begun, the scope is too narrow, and efforts should be made to expand them further. For relief undertakings managed by charitable organizations or private donations, if their strength is insufficient or their management is poor, the government should plan improvements. In particular, children's welfare undertakings should be provided with ample funding and unified educational standards. Social service centers in various places should be gradually promoted from important cities in the rear to war zones and border areas, and should focus on farmers, workers, and the poor and destitute as important targets for their services.</p>
<p>Regarding cooperative undertakings, the abnormal development of credit cooperatives in the past requires that more emphasis be placed on the promotion of production, marketing, and consumer cooperatives in the future, and they should be closely coordinated with professional organizations such as farmers and workers to achieve the actual effect of increasing production and stabilizing prices. A cooperative warehouse system should be established as soon as possible, so that cooperative organizations can fully exert their functions in wartime economy and local construction.</p>
<p>Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs</p>
<p>The report of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission on promoting the work of resistance and national reconstruction in Mongolia and Tibet is not without merit.</p>
<p>The Central and local authorities have been able to give considerable attention and effort. Other reports are also realistic, but slightly brief, making it difficult to see the actual plans and progress. The following points are specifically drawn to attention:</p>
<p>The case of organizing a Mongolian and Tibetan Comfort and Inspection Group has been resolved by the PPC twice, but has not yet been implemented. It should be given attention in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the Tibetan work section, opportunities should be used in the future to vigorously promote active construction work.</p>
<p>Border survey work should be conducted with a purpose and plan in accordance with the needs of time and place, and should be geared towards practical measures.</p>
<p>Border culture urgently needs to be developed. Subsidies for students below specialized subjects and border cultural groups should be given serious attention, strengthened, and promoted.</p>
<p>Relief</p>
<p>The work of the Relief Committee has generally been carried out as required in wartime, and it has been able to distinguish between the urgency of wartime needs to accomplish its tasks. A few points are summarized to encourage attention:</p>
<p>The war zones across the country are vast, and the number of people previously sheltered is already insufficient. In the future, as the war continues, the people will be displaced as the war ebbs and flows, and the number of victims will inevitably be less than in the past. It seems that the original number of shelters should still be maintained, and the number should be increased appropriately to meet the needs. As for young and strong refugees, they should be strictly screened and restricted.</p>
<p>Refugee factories are unable to achieve self-sufficiency because of high food prices and increased costs. It is hoped that more funds will be allocated to each factory to enable business to be developed and production increased, and attention should be paid to the accommodation of rough labor and women, so as to promote relief.</p>
<p>Small loan funds are essential in wartime. However, the area is vast, and the planned establishment of 14 loan offices within the year is still insufficient to cover the distribution. More funds should be actively and massively raised, and branches should be set up throughout the area.</p>
<p>The education and care of refugee children should be promoted in a planned and systematic manner. Attention should be paid to clearly defining the scope and nature of subsidies, and to appropriate allocation to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>Health</p>
<p>The health report and all its facilities should be adapted to the needs of wartime. However, the points listed are too brief, making it difficult to make a detailed assessment of the progress of the work. Based on current factual needs, there are still several points that need to be seriously improved:</p>
<p>Promote the public health system, strengthen the organization of basic-level health care below the county level, and promote the establishment of more mobile clinics or health inspection teams to travel to rural towns and benefit the general public.</p>
<p>The number of health workers is insufficient. Active efforts should be made to train public health personnel and cultivate a large number of personnel to meet the current needs. Medical personnel should also be conscripted and properly allocated.</p>
<p>All levels of organization should strive for command and control. Management of personnel in medical institutions at all levels, in particular, should be carefully guided, supervised, and promoted. Highway health stations should be increased in number. Prevention and eradication of infectious diseases should be actively pursued.</p>
<p>The management office for narcotics and the factory for the repair and manufacture of sanitary equipment should be well-equipped. The wartime pharmaceutical supply committee should strive for improvement.</p>
<p>Health funding should be increased so that health work can be smoothly promoted. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Far Eastern Situation Becomes Increasingly Tense; Japanese Ships on the Yangtze River All Cease Operations and Are Requisitioned by the Japanese to Transport Troops to Vietnam; Chinese Crew Members on the Tangshan Maru Dismissed</p>
<p>Four Dutch Ships May Be Requisitioned</p>
<p>As US-Japan negotiations continue intermittently, Japan has suddenly increased its troop presence in Vietnam, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense, leading to a daily increase in the number of Japanese merchant ships requisitioned by the Japanese government for military use. It was learned yesterday that the Xingchang Maru and Xingguo Maru of the "East Asia Shipping Company" in Shanghai have been requisitioned for military use following the Fengyang Maru and others. The two ships were originally Yangtze River liners and were intended to be rerouted to Ningbo. At present, out of the twelve Japanese ships on the Yangtze River route, ten have already been requisitioned for military use. In addition, the Tangshan Maru, with a deadweight of approximately 3,000 tons, was painted gray and sailed to Nagasaki, Japan, where all Chinese crew members were dismissed, and Japanese troops were loaded and transported to Vietnam.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Authorities Issue Requisition Order</p>
<p>The Chinese coastal routes have always been the center of foreign shipping power. The British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire hold the largest share of this power, followed by the Dutch Java China Japan Line (JCJL), which also occupies a portion, but in reality, it is still linked to the British and American sides. Since the outbreak of the European war, the British government has continuously requisitioned merchant ships for military use. It has been repeatedly reported that the ships of Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson in the Far East will be requisitioned. Therefore, the future trend of JCJL has attracted much attention, and the allocation of its ships has been of great concern. Currently, with the Pacific situation becoming increasingly tense and the uneasiness in Southeast Asia increasing, it is reported that the Dutch East Indies authorities have ordered the requisition of Dutch ships traveling between the Dutch East Indies and Shanghai. The JCJL freighter Tjilatjap (8,000 tons), scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in early December, has already been requisitioned. In the future, depending on the development of US-Japan relations, four other ships of the company may continue to be requisitioned. This matter has aroused attention from all sides.</p>
<p>Authority of Japanese Deputy Chief Inspector Expanded</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, after the assassination attempt on Japanese Special Deputy Chief Inspector Akira Akagi of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department, the SMC and the Japanese Consulate General reached an agreement to reorganize the Police Department, abolish the title of Special Deputy Chief Inspector, and establish two Chief Deputy Chief Inspector positions to assist the Chief Inspector in handling all matters. In the past, the Japanese Special Deputy Chief Inspector only handled liaison with the Japanese side. The newly established Japanese Chief Deputy Chief Inspector will have expanded powers to assist the Chief Inspector and hold considerable authority. This position has been filled by Masaru Watari, who was recommended by the Japanese side, and was announced by the SMC yesterday (29th). As for Shigeki Goto, the new Deputy Chief Inspector of the Police Department, a Major in the Gendarmerie, he will hold the same authority as the Department Heads in the capacity of advisor to both the Criminal and Political Departments, assisting the two Department Heads in handling all matters.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Price-Gouging Shops Will Not Be Tolerated</p>
<p>The Mildest Punishment is Imprisonment and Fines; Coal Merchants Allowed to Apply for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The SMC will order all police stations within its jurisdiction to investigate shops that exceed price limits within the week. The SMC Price Control Office has printed a large number of red stickers, which will be posted on the doors of the shops that are investigated and suspended, explaining the reason for the order to suspend business and the duration of the suspension. The mildest punishment is a fine of 300 yuan or imprisonment for up to six months. In addition, the public is encouraged to report shops that exceed price limits. If customers discover this, they can submit the invoice to the SMC Price Control Office, but must indicate the name and address of the reporter to ensure credibility. Once the facts are verified, they will be punished according to law. According to a spokesperson for the SMC, "The SMC will never tolerate it. Since we have controlled prices, we must eliminate speculation and profiteering, so that all industries can be brought back on the right track."</p>
<p>Cooperation Begins to Stabilize the Coal Market</p>
<p>Following the suppression of rice prices, the two concession authorities have begun to plan concrete measures to stabilize the coal market and are now fully cooperating with the relevant fuel organizations, such as the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association, and the Coal and Charcoal Industry Joint Association. The above-mentioned organizations held separate meetings a few days ago to discuss ways to assist the authorities in stabilizing the coal market. The members of each organization all advocated ① clearing the sources of smoke-free white coal, ② assessing standard coal prices, and ③ thoroughly investigating inventories on a large scale and releasing them on schedule at limited prices. It is heard that the implementation of this will be suggested to the authorities.</p>
<p>Coal Merchants Can Now Apply for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The Price Stabilization Fund Committee is deeply concerned about the foreign exchange needs of legitimate merchants in Shanghai. In response to the request of the SMC delegation to Hong Kong, Li Deming, the Committee approved the monthly supply of US$1 million in foreign exchange to coal merchants for the sole purpose of purchasing coal. According to banking circles, the coal merchants can now apply for the approved foreign exchange. Since coal merchants can obtain legitimate foreign exchange, the cost of purchasing goods will naturally decrease.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Hoarding Goods Restrict Wholesale</p>
<p>Due to the sharp increase in coal prices and the instability of the international situation, many factories in Shanghai have suspended operations or reduced their scale, and the entire industry is in a state of turmoil. Now, the factories are gradually resuming operations, and their output is doubling compared to the past. There are three reasons for this: ① The factories' monthly coal needs have been agreed upon by the authorities and the Japanese side, and a large amount of coal is transported from the guerrilla areas to the two concessions for sale to factories. The selling price of this coal is lower than that purchased in the coal market. ② A steady stream of orders and telegrams from overseas Chinese is pouring in. Because England, the Soviet Union, and other countries are at war, the production of industrial products has decreased. At the same time, when converted to gold prices, the cost is higher. However, purchasing goods from domestic companies is calculated in national currency, and the cost is significantly lower. Once transported to the local area, high profits can be obtained. At the same time, overseas Chinese are patriotic and actively promote the export of domestic goods. ③ As winter approaches, residents need to purchase clothing, and the two authorities control prices and strive to bring the business community back on track. The factories are starting operations and shipping goods to increase the inventory in the market. However, the factories have placed many restrictions on the quantity of goods wholesaled to commercial firms, with the aim of preventing hoarding.</p>
<p>SMC Price Controls Omit Daily Necessities of Chinese People</p>
<p>Citizens Eagerly Hope for Early Resolution</p>
<p>Since the authorities in the two concessions have taken emergency measures to suppress prices in a swift and decisive manner, the general rice shops and coal ball merchants have all sold according to the authorities' price limits. The millions of citizens in Shanghai are praising the authorities. However, there are still a small number of retail stores, such as general merchandise stores and cigarette paper exchange shops, where the prices of daily necessities are uneven because many goods have not been included in the price limits. For example, the price of rough paper commonly used by residents ranges from 1.50 yuan to 1.20 yuan per ream. The market price of popular cigarettes such as Lao Dao Pai, Pin Hai Pai, and Wu Hua Pai is even more uncontrolled. Therefore, the general public is deeply dissatisfied with these retailers, but they cannot do anything about it because the authorities have not set price limits. According to the general public's opinion, they deeply hope that the authorities in the two concessions will quickly continue to announce price limits for daily necessities needed by the common people, such as rough paper, soap, and tea, so that retailers have no room to maneuver.</p>
<p>Industrial Association Distributes Rice for Free</p>
<p>Raised 650,000 Yuan to Relieve Civilians in the Suburbs</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industrial Association has resolved to purchase 5,000 dan of foreign rice at a cost of 650,000 yuan to relieve the poor. It plans to distribute cooked rice free of charge at these two locations in winter. The association has hundreds of member factories, and its office is located in Rooms 656-656A-606, Hamilton House. It is understood that the association has no connection with the Importers Association, but will cooperate with the SMC to promote the revival of Shanghai industry as its highest mission. It will use its power to oppose any bill that harms industry and commerce, and support all measures that benefit industry and commerce. The association is an international organization and has hired many well-known experts to form various advisory committees. The association's important plans will be announced from time to time.</p>
<p>American Red Cross Helps with Relief</p>
<p>200 Bags of Broken Wheat</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been cold, and the number of poor people freezing to death on the streets is increasing, which is distressing. The Shanghai Three Religions Charity Association has started its winter relief efforts for a month, distributing more than 1,700 sets of clothing and more than 70,000 bowls of rice. The American Red Cross, in sympathy with the association's relief work,</p>

<p>Family and Housekeeping Discussion Meeting Yi</p>
<p>Not long ago, a newspaper reported that a certain prominent person's wife, in order to promote frugality and implement a new lifestyle, joined forces with like-minded women of high aspirations and organized a "Housekeeping Discussion Meeting." Members are required to strictly adhere to the creeds of "no gambling," "no smoking," and "no unnecessary socializing," and to practice frugality diligently.</p>
<p>This is indeed an admirable move. Gambling, smoking, and frequent unnecessary socializing disrupt household affairs, leave children without education, and husbands often run wild outside the home.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope that this "Housekeeping Discussion Meeting" will thoroughly discuss the shortcomings in Chinese families one by one and formulate improvement plans so that ordinary families can implement them accordingly.</p>
<p>Some people think that women discussing housekeeping is not the most important thing. However, if every housewife can manage a family in an orderly manner, not only will it be more stable and prosperous economically, but it can also influence husbands and children. Because when a husband can enjoy a wonderful family life at home, he will no longer want to waste time outside. And after a family's finances are very sufficient, the husband will not have to seek illicit income.</p>
<p>At the same time, children growing up in a perfect environment can develop excellent character and become useful talents.</p>
<p>In reality, whether a family is well-managed depends largely on the housewife's appropriate arrangements in housekeeping.</p>
<p>Seat Cushions and Table Runners Cui Fang</p>
<p>In a brightly lit room, seat cushions and table runners can be pure black. If pure black is too dark, then you might as well use dark blue.</p>
<p>Whether it is soft satin or poplin, both can be used as the material for making seat cushions and table runners. Soft satin is brighter, while poplin is more durable.</p>
<p>The patterns for making them are, first, the coiled dragon; second, maple leaves. The former is rich and magnificent, and the latter is classic and elegant. The former can be laid from autumn until the New Year, while the latter is the most appropriate decoration for the current season.</p>
<p>Embroidery Method: First, enlarge the pattern here and draw it on paper. Then, place a sheet of tracing paper underneath and spread it on the black satin, and trace the pattern onto the black satin. Next, stretch the black satin on a wooden frame used for embroidery. First, use gold thread to outline the contours of the coiled dragon or maple leaf, and then use golden yellow silk thread to fill in the empty spaces. If you don't use velvet thread, you can also use embroidery silk thread or floss.</p>
<p>Method of outlining the pattern with gold thread: Take two strands of surplus thread, place them side by side directly on the outline of the pattern, and use a small needle threaded with light yellow fine silk thread to sew the gold thread firmly onto the black satin at any time.</p>
<p>Method without using gold thread: This method is simpler. After completion, the pattern looks as if it were printed from an inked paper stencil.</p>
<h3>My Family Problem Essay Contest Announcement No. 9 A Gambling Mother Xiao Li</h3>
<p>My father passed away nine years ago, and I have no brothers. Both of my older sisters are married. So, there are only my mother and me at home. I work in a private clinic, but the remuneration I receive is only enough for my personal expenses. The source of income is based on the meager property left by my father.</p>
<p>Logically, the two of us, mother and daughter, should be living in mutual dependence. However, unfortunately, the reality is not so. My mother is addicted to gambling, but I hate playing cards. My mother dislikes me reading in my spare time, but I must do it. Therefore, my mother and I are completely incompatible.</p>
<p>Every morning, after finishing the housework, I rush to the clinic. I eat lunch at the clinic, and in the evening, I return home with a tired body. As usual, my mother is at the mahjong table, the rice is in the rice bucket, and the vegetables bought in the morning are still in the basket. I don't need to worry about her lunch, as the restaurant at the entrance of the alley will provide it. Gambling like this, forgetting to eat and sleep, constantly losing. I really don't know how we will maintain our future lives if we run out of these meager assets. Occasionally, I would advise her a few words, but she would glare at me, enumerating how unfilial I am, and how unreasonable I am… constantly nagging.</p>
<p>Living this kind of life, my spirit has nowhere to rest. I hope to get married; I need the nourishment and comfort of love.</p>
<p>Now, there is someone I am interested in. He is a childhood classmate, and I am satisfied with everything about him, but he is a person who has an elderly mother and younger siblings who need to be supported. He does not meet my mother's conditions for a live-in son-in-law. This summer, he graduated from university, and he said that we should have a "concrete commitment." How should I answer this? Although I like him very much, I definitely do not want to alienate the feelings between him, his mother, and his siblings. On the one hand, my mother cannot do without me either. So, regarding this matter, I think I can only sacrifice myself.</p>
<p>I feel that there is no possibility of marriage. Even if I can meet someone suitable again in the future, they may not meet my mother's conditions. Even if it is possible, I am unwilling to let others suffer for me - at least, having such a grumpy, gambling, and pleasure-seeking person living together, the family will definitely not be harmonious and healthy. So, rather than having problems arise in the future, I would rather not take this step now.</p>
<p>However, the life and old age of an old maid are lonely and miserable enough. And what is even more serious is that when youth has passed and economic panic occurs, that is truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>This problem is intricately woven into a net, trapping me deeply inside, full of worries, depression, and unsolvable problems.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The gambling habit of Chinese housewives can really be said to be a major loss to Chinese families. Like Ms. Xiao Li's mother, she has no affection for her own daughter because of gambling. Based solely on Ms. Xiao Li's description, it is difficult for us to make a definite judgment because family matters are the most complicated. Did this gambling mother like to gamble after marriage? The affection between mother and daughter certainly did not become incompatible in one day. And how do the two married sisters feel about this mother? Is it possible to persuade her to quit gambling?</p>
<p>In the situation that Ms. Xiao Li is in, direct dissuasion will definitely not work. It is necessary to move her with emotion, persuade her with methods, and use other hobbies that she loves to get her away from that gambling den. It really takes great patience, perseverance, and never give up.</p>
<p>As for the marriage problem, you can tell your current lover the real situation. For future lovers, you can continue to seek them. Conversely, enriching your own knowledge to lay the foundation for economic independence is also an urgent matter. Marriage is a major event related to lifelong happiness and is worth serious consideration. A woman who can achieve economic independence is also a commendable thing.</p>

<p>Method... After washing the crab, cut it into two halves and press it in dry flour. Then, fry it in oil until cooked. If you like to eat flour cakes, you must first mix the flour with cold water until thin and then thickly coat it around the crab. Then, put it in oil and fry it until it is cooked through. Wait until the flour outside the crab turns golden brown, then clamp it out. Separately, pour some water, add some soy sauce, etc., and briefly braise it. (When frying the oil, first put the scallion pieces into the hot oil and fry until charred. Sprinkle some salt as you go to make the oil emit a scallion flower fragrance. When mixing the flour, you may as well mix some ginger pieces, soy sauce essence, salt, and cooking wine into the flour and mix it together.) Eating crab with flour coating is more troublesome than eating other stir-fried crab roe, etc., because you have to peel the crab shell again.</p>

<h3>Report on British and American Air Forces Planning Patrols of the Burma Road; American Volunteer Group to Undertake This Task, with Aircraft Support from Malaya and Burma</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Military observers today, commenting on the programs reportedly under consideration in Washington, stated that "escorting" trucks on the Burma Road by the United States and Britain would be easy unless the Japanese could cut off the road. Once the Japanese launched an offensive from Vietnam towards the road, it was expected that they would concentrate their air power on the road in an attempt to cut off traffic or destroy war materials. Given Japan's current air superiority, this could be similar to Germany's concentrated submarine warfare against Britain's undefended Atlantic lifeline. Foreign military observers unanimously believe that patrols by British and American fighter planes would be sufficient as an "escort" against such attacks. This is precisely the true duty of Major General Chennault's American Volunteer Group. Its P-40 fighters and volunteer pilots could recently establish this system. If this force is insufficient to shoulder this arduous task, then fighter squadrons from the Philippines or the air forces of Malaya and Burma can be deployed to reinforce it, forming a fully capable "escort" program. Once Britain and the United States go to war with Japan, another important supply line may be opened. This issue has been under unofficial discussion for the past few weeks. This action would allow Chinese troops to, with British and American naval and air assistance, launch an offensive against Guangzhou, defeating the smaller, isolated Japanese garrison in Guangdong Province. Hong Kong, in this offensive, would become an important "cork," forcing the Guangzhou Japanese army into isolation and preventing its reinforcement. It is said that the recent arrival of Canadian troops in Hong Kong may be related to this, or it may be regarded as the ABCD forces' action of entering China to "escort" the Burma Road. Chongqing believes that this action should not be regarded as a genuine military action by the ABCD countries. (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington – A Reuters special correspondent reports that China will soon have its own "Flying Tigers" squadron to defend the vital lifeline of Chongqing and the Burma Road against Japanese attacks. While officials are keeping this plan strictly secret, some known facts suggest that this squadron will be entirely composed of volunteer pilots, but with the help of the US government. In recent months, many American aviators have resigned from their army and navy duties and traveled to China by ship. It is estimated that at least two hundred people will arrive in China in the near future. The Chinese side will undoubtedly experience great difficulty in obtaining foreign exchange to carry out this plan. The general public expects that Lend-Lease Act funds will be used. These American aviators will fly American fighters shipped to China under the Lend-Lease Act, mostly Tomahawk models. Their operational area will be approximately along the Burma Road and over Chongqing. Colonel Chennault will command these American aviators, his position will be similar to that of Colonel Sweeney when the British "Flying Tigers" squadron was first established.

<h3>The China Society of Natural Sciences Holds Its 14th Annual Meeting in Chongqing; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues Instructions</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The China Society of Natural Sciences held its 14th annual meeting in Chongqing on the 30th. Since its establishment in 1927, the Society has been highly valued by all parties. Its membership has reached over 1,400, making it a large-scale research institution in China. Branches have been established in major cities throughout the country. Since the outbreak of the war, branches in the occupied areas have ceased operations. There are three overseas branches, in England, Europe, and the United States. This year's annual meeting was held at the Chongqing University Auditorium at 9:00 AM on the 30th. Chairman Hu Huanyong presided over the meeting, with over one hundred members in attendance. Minister of Education Chen and Acting President Zhu of the Academia Sinica both attended and delivered speeches. Zhu believed that governing natural sciences should focus on on-the-spot investigation and research, while also aiming to promote the development of applied science. Chen first elaborated on the relationship between applied science and pure theoretical science, arguing that the development of applied science can promote the progress of pure theoretical science, and the development of pure theoretical science can also promote the progress of applied science. Chen then broadly discussed the Book of Changes and the teachings of the Six Arts in ancient China, proving that China has been engaged in the research of natural sciences for a very long time. Finally, he encouraged the members of the Society to work hard in the study of natural sciences with perseverance and enthusiasm. Subsequently, the heads of various departments of the Society reported on the Society's affairs. The meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, the general assembly continued to discuss the Society's affairs, read papers, and hold thematic discussions. The theme was "Promoting Scientific Education Programs." (Reported on the 30th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The China Society of Natural Sciences convened its 14th annual meeting in Chongqing on the 20th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially issued instructions, saying, "To Chairman Hu and all members of the China Society of Natural Sciences: At this important period of resistance and national reconstruction, it is most gratifying that your Society is holding its annual meeting in the wartime capital to serve the country with academic research. Our country, with its backward science and weak national defense, has been fighting a strong neighbor for over four years, sacrificing heroically. We, in recalling Sun Yat-sen's instructions to catch up, further realize the importance of saving the country through science. Overcoming the enemy and achieving victory certainly lies in the development of science, and the great cause of national reconstruction in the future depends even more on the contributions of scientists in many aspects. The so-called national reconstruction must establish a secure national defense, and even more so establish the nation's independent scholarship. In recent years, thanks to the consistent advocacy of the government and society, an increasing number of students have enthusiastically participated in various departments of applied science. This is certainly a good phenomenon, but everything has its foundation, especially in scholarship. If theoretical science does not have a solid foundation, then applied science cannot make real progress. Your Society takes exploring scholarship as its mission, and should pay special attention to promoting this point, so that China's scientific education does not suffer from the drawbacks of achieving quick success due to temporary urgent needs. The construction of western China has always been relatively backward. Since the start of the war of resistance, the southwestern provinces have become the center of the country's politics, economy, and culture. Most of the members of your Society are gathered in the southwest, and you have also organized a Northwest Science Expedition to conduct on-the-spot exploration, in order to enrich the data for scientific research in the west. With the special convenience of working in the west today, I hope you will follow your original intentions and work even harder to promote the construction of the west through in-depth research. In this way, the strengthening of the foundation for resistance and national reconstruction, and the benefit to the great cause of national reconstruction, will be immeasurable. I express my views to encourage you all." Chiang Kai-shek, Seal of Respect and Care. (Reported on the 30th)</p>
