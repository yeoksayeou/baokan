<h3 id="c3">日本進佔越南以後 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>本報前曾指陳南太平洋的新危機，認爲越南風雲，迫在眉睫，日方所準備者，究爲和平談判，爲武力行動，抑屬以武力脅迫談判，雖不可知，在法越方面，固無力且無意於抗禦，其已往之讓步以及飲鴆止渴之苟安心理。亦殊鮮振拔之望。果然，事實答復，全不出吾人之所預料，維希政府已同意日本「暫時佔領」法屬越南之重要根據地及飛機塲，維希發言人之所謂「僅爲暫時之措置」以「保護越南」，及「法國認爲日本暫時佔領越南之軍事根據地，係以不威脅越南之完整及法國之主權爲條件」，純係自欺之談，其一種飲鴆止渴之心理，躍然紙上，而日本之以武力脅迫談判，亦可淤此數語中得之。自蘇德戰事爆發以來，日本朝野，徬徨苦悶，南進北進之聲浪，甚囂塵上，再經過倒閣政潮，阢隍不安者。凡三十餘日，至目前進佔越南爲止，可稱告一段落。</p>
<p>維希政府此决與日本所成立之越南協定，其內容究屬何若。尙未目睹，無從臆測，但據未證實之消息所傳。則日本軍隊已開進越南之據點六處，並已佔領兩飛機塲；而河內電訉，又謂日本所要求者，在使用越南南部之便利，吾人就目前事態發展言，可斷定維希所應允日方者，異常廣泛，殆將越南全部整個斷送。日本進佔越南，今後之動向如何，就過去之日本機會政策來推論，似未必立刻急進，與英美在南太平洋掀起大戰，其古有可足以推闡者：一，日本在歐戰局勢未有劇烈變化以前，決不願開罪英美，惟爲應付軸心同盟國之壓力起見，乃進佔越南，在表面上看來，結集大兵於越南南部，形成大舉南進之姿勢，牽制英美，聊以稍盡同盟國之義務，其實則乘機漁利，遂行其「和平南進」之計畫，然後再徐圖發展。二，越南之富源，並不亞於荷印，以農產品言，則產米之多，居世界第四位，每年產額約四百五十萬至五百萬噸，而法人所經營之橡皮生產，年亦達六萬九千噸。至著名之礦產，以鴻基白煤一項而言，年產二百三十萬噸，埋藏量的十一萬萬噸。其餘尙有少數之錫·銻·鎢等礦產，均爲國防上所必需之原料，日本國內正當資源枯竭之候，旣已攫佔越南，自可予取予求，從事開發，以極少之代價，得廣大之富源，已極心滿意足，又奚待大舉南進，作毫無把握之冒險？三，日本之進佔越南，除攫佔富源外，其在軍事上之意義，允不容忽視，日本最予重視者，厥爲康瀾灣，其地在西貢之東北，即越南避暑勝地大叻DALAT之海濱。三面屛障，港僻水深，爲海軍之良好根據地，居香港，馬尼刺，星加坡之中、於南太平洋之地形上，佔極險要之位置。一九〇五年，帝俄波羅的海艦隊一度寄泊於此，稱爲良港。其後越南政府曾計畫遷首都大叻，而一意經營此優良之軍巷，但以因循苟且，世變日亟，卒未果行。今日軍旣獲此良港，自以全副精力，從事開闢，作爲日海軍今後在甫太平洋之前哨綫；但闢一軍港，至非易事，非經年累月不爲功，故日軍對英·美·荷印，今後祇須虛張聲勢，予以重大威脅，而欲其立即大舉前進，似尙非其時。四，日本爲一機會主義者，旣不欲開罪於英美；同時亦深知英美之不欲輕率啟釁，故取得優越地位，靜待世局演變，以爲將來討價還價之地步，萬一歐戰局勢，有利於民主陣綫，日本亦可以旣得之地位，從容論價。五，日本自侵華以來，今已進入第五年，軍旅之久困，國內之怨望，已不待具論，茲所以陳兵南海，攫佔越南者，蓋欲以綏靖日本國內之人民，以爲今又在軍事上與政治上，獲得重大勝利，藉以緩和激昂之民氣。綜上所述，日本在進佔越南以後，似將經過若干時期，再圖他舉，一若去年河內協定簽訂後之情勢者然。</p>
<p>雖然，日本此一行動，所引起美國之反響爲何如？美國今後仍將採取綏靜政策耶？抑或仍以「雷聲大，雨聲小」之姿態，作一時之憤怒耶？吾人目前所獲得之消息，美國于日本行動一經決定後，即將實施經濟對付。美國務副卿威爾斯並嚴詞斥責日本爲侵略國，認爲日之佔越，係對美國國防供給原料及對菲律濱之最後威脅。日本向以美國只有空言而無實際，但此决美國態度之嚴峻，逈異曩時。故今後南太平洋之危機，將益增嚴重性。此殆可斷言者也。</p>

<p>路透社二十五日河內電　河內「越南意志報」頃載大的官塲授意之社評、首决公開言及以越南南部根據地給予日本之協定、謂此項協定並非針對任何一國而作、且僅屬暫時性質、法方在越南之主權問題不受影響、越南之輿地上位置、處於前往荷印與新加坡之途中、而日本不能從海南島·或台灣·或在華佔領區·或日本之遙遠根據地·繼續進行其向南擴張之政策、此項協定乃維希與東京間直接商定者、而法方之訂此恊定、藎欲防杜越南成爲戰塲、故縱因此而作暫時似感痛苦之讓步亦所不惜云、</p>

<p>迨民十一二間，已故水利家李儀社氏奔走呼　，倡修涇惠渠，民十九，省府實施興修，民二十一，得華洋義賑會會款補助，渠成水到，裨益農田，功效大著。關中陝北，始咸知注重農田水利，遵從李氏倡導，競闢新渠。織女·渭惠·梅惠·洛惠·黑惠各渠，先後興工，陝南亦由省府於民二十三設水利管理局，從事改善舊堰。李氏更復於民二十四括舉灌溉·航運·水電三項，擬就陝南水利十年計劃，灌溉一項，並建議興修漢惠·褒惠·定惠·澧惠各渠，預計計劃完成後，受益地畝可在八百萬畝以上。軍興以來，陝南水利局更因適應需要，於二十七年起，先後施工整理嘉陵江水道，興建漢·褒二渠。並因湑水水量甚大，舊堰於沿渠水田揷秧時節，未能盡量蓄水放水，擬添建湑惠渠，以期水盡其用。今除嘉陵江水道已於去年竣工，湑惠渠尙在籌建外，在漢惠渠興工以前開築之涇·渭·梅·織四渠，已早完成，洛·黑二渠，及在漢惠興工以後開築之褒·定·灃三渠，均尙未竣工，漢惠渠以陝西第五位水渠於本月（七月）一日完成放水。漢中一帶人民習於故常，所謂「漢水不澆田」之古諺，從此打破。陝南水利，漸改舊觀。千年利澤，功在民生。記者睹此盛事，爰爲搜採渠之梗概。</p>
<p>建築經過</p>
<p>渠長三十一公里，位於漢水上遊沔縣，褒城境之北岸。其二十一公里流經沔縣，餘在褒城境內。引漢水入渠之起點，係在沔縣武侯祠附近。經陝省府最近卸任之前主席蔣鼎文氏規定實施與築，由建廳派總工程師劉鍾瑞於二十七年十二月開始調查設計，二十九年二月徴工淮行。各項工程截至本年五月杪，除一小部份零屋工程須至年底完竣外，大體已如期就緒，業於七月一日舉行隆重之放水典禮，宣吿完成。計總共用工程費一百八十八萬六千四百零七元。處此戰時，省庫窘迫物力艱難，而能成此偉舉，固有足多。兩縣士紳民衆擔任工役，並皆艱苦奮鬭，始終無人出一怨言。具見大後方每個角落之官員人民，俱已一變向日因循自誤之積習，而爲振作有爲之建設，尤堪欣慰。</p>
<p>工程要點</p>
<p>據劉總工程師語人，漢渠各項工程之功效，有如下述：（一）漢渠引水口用欄大壩遏止漢江小水，不使任意流水，以便引用。但壩頂之形態以適於滾水爲原則。如洪水超過渠道所需水量，則餘水可由壩頂滾去。在壩之下游，另用消力設備，以抵消洪水波濤，免致毀壞壩身。壩頂高度爲標高五八一·六五公尺，（按即超出海平面五八一·六五公尺）。即洪水入渠之水面最高爲五八一·六五。（二）漢渠引水口起點之渠底，高度爲五七九·五公尺，即渠底較塌頂低二·一公尺，所設引水閘門三孔，每孔寬二·五公尺，最大引水面積爲十五方公尺，用以引爲每秒十一公方之水量，甚有餘裕。（三）漢水入渠之後，因工程設備不同，水流速度並不一致。而在土渠內每秒約行〇·六公尺，即每小時渠水行一·一公里。故此次渠成，堵壩引水，未及三日，水流達黃沙河畔。水流不使過快，亦不使過慢，所以防冲刷渠岸，或冰積泥沙。（四）沿渠地面高度，有平面圖上之等高級綫表示，農民按圖索驥，即知何處可引用渠水，何處不能引用。例如渠水流至尹家溝某號渡水橋，其渠底高度爲五七七·九七公尺，此即指示其地凡農田栽種地面在五七七·九以上之處，均不能引水灌溉，在五七七·九以下之處，皆可引水灌漑。（五）渠水以漢江流量爲來源，最多每秒可引用十一公方。若以十一公方灌漢渠全區，十日之內可灌足一週。惟今年自六月試水之日起，漢江水量小至每秒三公方，以工事關係，且僅引用二公方，故截至六月杪止，僅灌田四萬畝。明春農歷淸明節後，引用縱水量如仍似今年，當可支撑全區稻田揷秧之用。</p>
<p>利益估計</p>
<p>據二十七年之調查估計，漢渠灌漑區域內，水田地價平均每畝約値八十元，旱地約値四十元，水田每畝純益約二十元，旱地約六七元。現在漢渠完成，可溉田十萬餘畝，除去原有水田約三萬畝不計外，受益地畝增加七萬餘畝。每年農產物，每畝以增收稻一石二斗，折米四斗八升，按照時價（米每石四百四五十元）增收純益三百元計，總共可增收米四萬八千石，多獲純益二千一百萬元。而早地變爲水田，其地價之差，每畝以最少數五百元計，地價之總增値爲三千五百萬元。</p>

<p>艇長望着羅盤，說了聲「六十呎」，一面却把凍結了的雨帽和頭巾脫下，海軍上尉便爽利地傳布命令，管理漂浮杆的兵士，便用着歷年訓練得純熟如機械的手腕，迅速遵命而行。海軍上尉的專心一志，也像風琴家的注意於音節變換。艇身遂漸下傾，旋吿停止，已到了水平的地位了。管理潛艇緊尾舵輪的兩個正副舵手舒了一口氣，道時絲絲的聲音也沒有了。</p>
<p>副司令報吿：「六十呎了，長官！」</p>
<p>艇長答一聲「好」，便移步向前，拍去手套上的冰屑，又說道：「我們吃杯茶吧！托潑斯有着櫻桃醬呢。」</p>
<p>副司令應聲道：「好呀！我正在想着呢。」他跟着艇長走進軍官室，一面說：「我此决遠行，恐怕要于思滿頰了」</p>
<p>司令由潛望鏡視察海面，他間或把鏡頭繞着圈子，踏板上的兩足，也跟着微微轉動，但是身體却依然維持同一的方向。</p>
<p>他在早先幾分鐘，已令艇員各守職位。魚雷管員排列在魚雷管後面，發射手已經坐定在槓杆的前面，用手擦鼻，若有所思。他們和管理室是隔離的，和潛望鏡旁屛息無言的司令官，也隔着好幾間小室；這時他們都是無事可作。魚雷管的弓形帽忽然開啓，水湧進來。只等時機一到，紅燈發亮，射手便要拉動下面的槓杆了。</p>
<p>他們低聲猜測艇長所見的事物。管理室中的幾個比他們確要略勝一等，因爲艇長有時說話，海面上有何事發生，就可由此略知一二了。但魚雷管員却盲如蝙蝠，聾如大衛的猪，一無見聞。這一點他們自己也承認，並且習以爲常，視若固然了。</p>
<p>發射手咆哮了一聲，從袋裏摸出一把棉絮，揩擦槓杆，好像劊子手臨刑時磨擦他的斧頭。那兩個艇員，彼此以肘相觸。原來出發前五天，發射手的房屋，恰被炸彈所毀。他的妻子雖然獲救，但是他五歲的獨生女兒，葬身瓦礫堆中，等到掘出，已是死了。他只有四天的工夫去安葬她。</p>
<p>砲手和裝彈的人，都立在彈藥庫門首砲門的下面。他們也和魚雷管員一樣，對於外面的事，一無所知。可是他們都知道踏板或會急向上傾，艇長就會發令預備開砲，他們就得拉開上面的砲門，在潛艇浮起之際跑上架砲的平台，將彈送入砲膛，便向所見的目標轟擊了。</p>
<p>海面上的砲戰，常是抱着必死之心的。假使被敵彈洞穿，就休想再潛入水中了。所以第一發子彈就須瞄得準確，以求必中。</p>
<p>曉得現在海面情形的，祇有司令一人。他凝視着潛望鏡所映見的景物，全部神經，都沉浸於繁複的計算中，每隔一會，就有一隙綠色的水沫打着漩渦，把潛望鏡遮住。過此水沫四散，他又能望見他的目的物了，遺時候他便須計算牠的方向，速度，和離開自己潛艇的距離；他須決定他的應付方略，預測敵人發現他凸出的潛望鏡時的攻擊方針。他問或發出改變潛艇方向的命令。他潛引而進，見敵方船只六艘，由驅逐艦　艘在旁掩護，正從左舷至右舷曲折而行。太陽適在目標的後面，陽光照在白浪頂上，發出耀目的亮光，使他潛望時不免發生困難；而且敵方瞭望員發現潛望鏡的危險，也因此增加了。護航的驅遂艦隨時有掉頭向他衝來的可能，近至何處方始開火，須由他決定，且須由他一個人決定，每一分鐘的過去，增加了擊中敵船的可能性，同時也增加了自身被發覺和毀滅的危險。等到成敗的機會恰正相等的時候，就全靠他的經騐理智，來決定進退了。</p>
<p>上尉立在旁邊望着他，一手撫着趨曲的初生之　，心中想着某政治家說過的一句話：「高級指揮可驚的孤獨」。但是無論在陸上，在海上，或是在空中，沒有一個潛水艇艇長在攻擊中時再感到孤獨的了。共他的軍事領袖，都有他人輔佐，或許是一個副官，或許是一支軍隊，但是無論怎樣，他有自己的觀感，獨自的判斷，以留待將來的回憶。沒有一個軍事領袖，也沒有一個人，會忘却此種觀察的。或是遏阻在暴的衝動，或則鼓勵動搖的勇氣。但是一艘潛水艇的艇長，却是他動作的唯一審判官，和唯一陪審官，非但當時如此，而且永遠這樣。</p>
<p>開火！</p>
<p>發射手把槓杆向後急速的一板，潛水艇頓時受着一陣震動。</p>
<p>「放下潛望鏡，左舷一十五！」</p>
<p>在潛艇內部，所聽見的只有發動機的營營之聲。艇長立着看那長針慢慢的在鐘面上爬行，餘去坐在羅盤，船輪，和槓杆旁邊，沉着游昂，靜候侖令。駕駛員拿着鉛筆，俯伏在地圖之上，記錄航錢的變更，幾分鐘過去了，他們的心跳得很快，倒覺得一秒的時間太慢了。上尉重新想起了他的鬍子，手指的骨節格格作響，耳鼓的震動才覺得好些。</p>
<p>潛水艇震盪了一下。</p>
<p>緊張立刻鬆弛了。低語之聲四起，接着又是一個簡捷的命令「升起望遠鏡」。艇長蜷曲了俯視望遠鏡幾秒鐘，突然挺身而起，急遽地發出一　串的命令。海軍上尉把牠詳細解釋出來，甲板陡向下傾，隔一會又回到水平的位置。發動機已經停止，全艇寂然無聲，艇長兩目注視着深度計，說道：「我們已將護航隊的領隊船置入囊中了。但是我想驅逐艦中已有一駛見到魚雷的痕跡。牠以全速力向我們駛來，預備着深水炸彈吧」！</p>
<p>艇身一陣劇烈的震動，如受重槌猛擊，把發言人彈出去。接着又是一次，第三次的震動，允其猛烈，一陣玻璃的破碎聲，燈光全滅。電炬的光茫，旋即在室中掃射，室中的人，一個一個的顯現出來，依然守着職位，有的從毛絨大衣中露出獰視的面孔，有的兩手緊握輪盤槓杆，艇長則彎着腰，想把脫了骱的拇指恢復原狀。光綫在四面照射，搜尋裂口。</p>
<p>只聽得上尉鎮靜的說道：「裝上預備的電燈泡吧」！他手中的電炬，重復射到艇長的身上，問題：「你的傷不妨事嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，我不過坐在拇指上，壓痛罷了。你快去檢視潛艇是吾無恙吧。駕駛員在嗎」</p>
<p>「何事？」</p>
<p>「到這裹來，拉一拉我的拇指」。</p>
<p>又一個深水炸彈在他們的頭上爆發，艇內的空氣，似乎壓縮了又膨脹開來。</p>

<p>疋頭　香港南洋幫　趕裝疋頭　今有一千一百件啓運</p>
<p>廠布昨市平穩、實銷仍乏開展、投機費買亦多數暫取觀望態度、港幫南洋幫趕裝甚亟、惟新貨進意甚淡、聞係船隻稀少、與增加運費之故、各布售盤一致平穩、祇少數缺檔貨及期貨加價每疋二角半至五角、本街成交現期貨五百餘件、粤港南洋幫辦色布色斜漂布印花布等一百數十件、北路烟津幫辦斜紋絨法絨粗布等七八十件、今日有疋頭一千一百四十件運香港、二百件運烟台、</p>

<h3 id="c30">自由中國氣象蓬勃　奠定新經濟基礎　國防工業品謀自給自足　農村復興計畫逐步實現 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>將於今日出版之密勒氏評論報、刊載特約通訊一篇、論述華西經濟之新發展、謂中國古諺曰、「天無絕人之路、」鑒於中國正在內地重建經濟基礎、可知此語之不虛、以沿海各省之新興工業大多被毀、中國全面開始在安全富腴之大後方、再行從事經濟之復興與建設、</p>
<p>經濟動員早定計畫</p>
<p>戰後中國政府擬定一經濟動員之計劃、在工業方面、力謀於最短期間內、戰事所需之工業品、得能自給自足、並支持生產軍甩品及日用品之工廠、以及統制其產品之銷售、同時又援助沿海省工廠內遷、發起創立新工廠、並給以經濟上及技術上之援助、此外藉軍警之保護、防止此等工廠之罷工風潮、</p>
<p>創立重要工礦組織</p>
<p>經濟部之主要工作有四、（一）軍需製造之增加、（二）出口品之增加、日用品製造之增加、及（四）主要工業及礦業之發展、自一九三八年該部成立以還、遂竭力促進各項之實行、曾動用官資、創立主要工礦組織、資助私立廠家自戰區內遷、同時鼓勵後方人民投資生產事業、四年以來、中國經濟情形、較之戰前、有三大不同之點、</p>
<p>國防工業圓滿發展</p>
<p>第一、戰前中國經濟企業、集中於少數之沿海省份、而今經濟中心已遷至具有安全保障得能和平發展之西南及西北、第二、戰前中國國防重工業甚少、雖中國政府審愼計劃多方鼓勵、但中國重工業尙難積極生產、今日中國之國防工業、包括銅鐵·雷氣·機械·化學及冶鑛工廠等、在政府或民營之管理下、巴有圓滿之發展、雖目前尙未達到自給之地步、已不啻爲日後國防工業之有力發展、奠一基礎、</p>
<p>農村經濟奠定基礎</p>
<p>第三、一九三七年夏以前、中國農村情形落後、尤以西南及西北諸省爲甚、今日此等省份之經濟發展、已有驚人進步、此種農村情形之有利轉變、須歸功於農村金融之穩定、灌溉方法之實施、農村合作之倡導、以及農村技術與農產出口之改良等、戰前政府發動一特別注重於湘鄂贛等省之重工業五年計劃、而戰爭遂促使政府不得不在華西建築一經濟之堡壘、</p>
<p>自給自足三年計劃</p>
<p>近來工礦發展三年計劃、業已開始、其目的在擴充旣得結果之力量、以使自給自足之效率、隨戰事之延長而俱增、查戰初工廠自沿海或沿揚子江城市內遷者、數可四百五十、其中一百六十八爲機器廠、此等工廠之產品、計有軍器·發電機·工業器具·機器製造及交通器具等各類、經濟部特設之工礦調整委員會、即從事援助私營生產工業、而上海·漢口·宜昌·各地大量工廠內遷所遭之困難、大部份爲此等工廠勞資雙方之合作、及調整委員會當局堅毅之精神所克服、因大部份之輪船、以戰事被徴軍用、故此等內遷之機器及設備等、不得不用小舟溯江西運、以達內地、</p>
<p>政府資助內遷工廠</p>
<p>在工廠內遷期中、政府特別重視機器廠　電氣化學工廠等、因此種工廠能直接襄助兵工廠之工作、對於棉織麵粉·等有助民生之工廠、先已予以注意、除以低利率貸放鉅款於此等內遷工廠外、政府當局復自國外輸入大宗物料及器具並供給技術人材、促成其在內地指定塲所、迅速復工、此外戰爭四年中、當局顧念民艱、减低商稅、國道貨物運費减少、津貼補助費之實施、工業發明改進特予專利、貸款於小工業及手工業、並鼓勵中外人壬投資官辦公司等、</p>
<p>節省儲金移辦工業</p>
<p>新近政府決定利用銷售節省券所得之一都以發展工業、其數在一萬萬元之譜、去年在政府管理下之重要工礦各廠、其總產量値四十六萬九千三百七十萬元　、但分佈自由中國各處之小工廠生產量、則不計在內、其中紡織居首、達十七萬六千三百萬元、化學工業次之、佔十四萬三千八百萬元、金產又次之、再次爲電氣　礦產等、</p>
<p>工礦各廠嚴格管理</p>
<p>政府所辦之工礦各廠悉由全國資源委員會管理、迄今該會在內地分設七土一「單位」屬工業者一十九礦業二十二、電機二十、對於機械·化學·電機·焙焊各菜、尤予優先權利、礦業中區重有關國防之煤·鐵·油·銅及向外國交換所需之鎢·錫·銻·汞等水力亦已在可能之處應用、據估計四川一省之河流、其潛藏之力量、達二千九百萬基羅瓦特、又增加金產起見、經濟部特設採金委員會、</p>
<p>華西設立工業根據</p>
<p>迄去年年底、工廠內數達四百五十所、機器重達十一萬六千三百七十五噸、另有技術工人一萬二千名、由政府資助旅費赴內地、另有工人三萬名、由其他機關援助前往內地、在過去四年中、新工業根據地十五處已在華西設立、據去年年底之報吿、在此等根據地之工廠、資本在一萬以上、僱用工人三十名以上、並應用電力者、數達一三五四家、計機械廠三一二、採礦及冶金九三、電機四七、化學三六一、紡織三八二、其他二五九、</p>

<p>上海泰晤士報云、關於上海英商自來火公司减收附加費事、該公司或公共租界工部局與法租界公董局均未正式宣布、惟昨（二十四日）向可靠方面探悉、自八月一日起、煤氣附加費將從白分之二百五十减至百分之一百六十、</p>
<p>上海市民至感欣慰</p>
<p>查上海市民備遭附加費等生活費用飛漲之壓迫、度日維艱、迄今數載、茲聞核减煤氣附加費、尙屬初次聆得欣慰之消息、至於煤氣减收附加費之原因、尙未確悉、然許多煤氣用戶所聞者、旣爲减費、則對减費原因、殆未必予以重大關心也、</p>
<p>官方日內正式宣佈</p>
<p>聞官方將於日內正式宣布煤氣附加費之减低、目下此項附加費爲百分之二百五十、將减至百分之一百六十、但以煤氣基金價格計算、質言之、目下各煤氣用戶繳費之總數、平均將减百分之二五·七一、自來火公司前於提高附加費時、須在匝月前通知用戶、减費則將立即實施、</p>
<p>電力公司尙無表示</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、頃悉英商上海自來火公司提議减收附加費後、今（二十五日）晨仍候工部局正式核准中、一俟接獲當局消息、即將正式官布、記者頃向上海電力公司其要員叩詢該公司是否有减收附加費之可能、據稱、現煤價飛漲、而獲取運煤船隻更形困難、故渠未見有减費之可能、煤斤平時每噸約十元、現已漲至三百元、該公司收入百分之八十六、皆耗於購煤、</p>
<p>平賣煤球遭遇反對</p>
<p>煤球市價、因同業競爭而趨回跌後、惟與其成本相較、仍有厚利可沾、致市民生活威脅仍難輕减、機製煤球公會自去年辦理煤球平賣、（前後共計八期、每期十天、每天平賣一千七百担）、後以市價回平而結束、今鑒於物價較昔尤昂、煤球售價倍於當時、市民生計益形艱危、故擬繼續策動平賣、藉以减輕市民負担、兼以壓平市價、但遭數大煤球廠之反對、故難能如願　行、各該煤球廠並闢室另行組織、其動機爲反對續辦平賣及限制漲價、望當局予以合法制裁、</p>

<h3 id="c66">俠盜的病 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 江洪</p>
<p>兩個靑年的學生，羨慕俠盜亞森羅蘋的行爲，實行刦富濟貧，致觸法網。這件事，將在三十日宣吿判決了。無疑的，結果是徒刑七年。我們的社會，至今還是把這一類的事件當普通的罪案看待。法庭上把兩生的學校成績報吿單吊去，證明兩被吿平日品行尙佳，於是兩位傷心的母親疑惑起來了，「此决不知如何，作此犯法之事」。我們的社會也祇看到他們犯法，並不曾去注意到他們犯法的原因。這等於一位醫生祇看到病人頭痛脚痛的病症，而不曾把病源找出來。道樣治病，怎能有成效呢？是的，從科學的觀點上看來，我們應該把這案件當病症一樣看待。這是心理上的病症，是精神上的病症。效法俠盜亞森羅蘋這一回事，祇是病症的爆發而已，當他們在家裏『安分守已』地沉迷在偵探小說中的時候，這病症已在潛伏與進行中了。家庭中或環境上的缺憾（譬如父母或家人對靑年的不了解與錯誤的態度），往往是致病的根本原因，偵探小說是導火綫，而俠盜行爲是病症的爆發。我們知道不把病人送到醫院裏去而把他們關進監牢，是一件愚蠢的舉動，然而我們終於還是把這兩位「生病』的靑年送進監牢裏去了，因爲我們的社會還不明白這是一種病。這是大可慨嘆的！</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3 id="c67">刦富濟貧 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 立民</p>
<p>兩個硏究偵探學的靑年學生『刦富濟貧』的事件，在報上發表以後，曾經轟動一時，特別是因爲這兩個十八歲的靑年，利用偵探學識，使捕房當局一時無從偵查，更引起大家的興趣。各報對於這一件事，已經有過不少的批評，然而它們的重心，多數集中在抨擊不良的讀物一方面。這固然也是一種看法，然而我以爲這種看法是不够澈底的，這種看法不曾把問題的核心捉住。</p>
<p>我們此後應該注意靑年讀物的選擇，我們應該不遺餘力地去掃蕩誤人子弟的毒素讀物，這是對的。然而這祇是治標的辦法。在根本上，我們應該把這件事看做心理衛生的問題，看做家庭教育的問題，看做對於靑年的暸解問題。要是不然的話，即使我們使不良的讀物絕跡市上了，這類靑年誤入歧途的事件，還是將繼續發生的，最多也不過換了一種方式表現出來而已。</p>
<p>靑春時期的少年，正當內心躍躍欲動，凡事不能自持自制的時期，是特別需要成人的友愛，指導，與瞭解的。成人所給他們的心靈上的安慰，是他們內心熱烈情緒的安全瓣。在缺少心理上的慰藉的時候，他們必定要替自己尋找一條冒險性的出路，於是，亂子鬧出來了。刦富濟貧不過是她們塡補心靈上的缺憾的一種方式而己。</p>
<p>據說這兩位靑年事前曾向家長要求捐助一點款子給兒童敎養院，遭受了家長的反對，因此感到很不滿意。如果這情形是確實的話，那麼我們敢斷言，這兩位家長一定不懂待靑年的心理，一定沒拿好臉色給他的子弟看，特別是在平常的時候，一定也沒有得到子弟的信任。不然的話，這種事件是不至於發生的。</p>
<p>捐款給慈善機關原是一件好事，子弟有這種眼光，是値得贊許的。即使爲了甚麽特殊的原因不能贊同，也應該用同情的態度設法向子弟解釋，以免引起子弟的誤會。這雖然似乎是小事，可是却是很重要的。因爲問題的核心也許就在這裏。</p>
<p>把這類事件的責仟完全擺在無知的靑年身上是不應該的。把這種事情當普通的罪案看待也是不合理的。當這類事件發生的時候，我們更看到組織少年法庭的必要了。我們以爲這件案子與其交給法官去辦，勿寗交給心理學家去辦。</p>

<h3 id="c68">我們到防空洞去 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 荷</p>
<p>天氣晴朗，預料着又要「跑警報」了。（當有警報時，我們到防空洞去，我們叫做「跑警報」。）</p>
<p>戰後。在重慶的人們，「跑警報」已是有相當老的資格了。平時，一切可貴的東西，自己喜歡的東西及足以留着做紀念的珍藏着的東西都收拾好，整理齊備。遇到一有警報，各人就忙碌起來。可穿的穿，可戴的戴，別的拿着。</p>
<p>太太小姐們還有換上好衣服，上防空洞去的。原因是：衣服拿在手上，而且过還要拿別的東西；實在不方便，不如穿在身上了。</p>
<p>又因爲天氣熱，怕洞內空氣難聞；因此有人還擦了香水來。但是，天氣雖然熱，洞裏却很凉快，好像有冷氣設備似的！和洞外的氣溫足足相差二三十度呢。因此人人都不的而同地帶件羊毛衣，絨綫杉之類的外套。</p>
<p>在防空洞裏，大家也有認識的，也有不認識的，但是，大家都會坦白地談起天來；眞熱鬧極了。我們可以藉此機會，認識許多朋友。帶茶點來的，帶水菓來的，彼此交換着吃。眞比任何娛樂塲所還要有趣！我們常遇到會說笑話的人，播散着笑的種子給人。就像大家是老朋友！</p>
<p>還有做小生意的人，也就利用這個機會，賣東西了。鮮菓汁，葡萄，西瓜，美國橘子（四川產的），桃子，花紅，蘋果都有。</p>
<p>防空洞裏兩邊，一排一排的座位，常中留一條路可以自由進出。</p>
<p>私家的防空洞，設備更加完美。有圍棋，有象棋，可以消遣。有桌，有椅，或石檯石櫈。茶水都預備好的。有時還在洞裏開宴會。</p>
<p>有一家西菜社，就特爲設在防空洞內。專做警報時的生意，他們眞懂得心理學呢！你想：遇了警報，入了防空洞；誰都得借此休息一下！您也可以借此機會交際交際，要不，您自己點些什麽吃吃喝喝。也好！在這一種塲合和環境之中，畢竟沒有什麽人收緊了錢袋的口；不捨得吃喝了！所以道是件賺錢生意！</p>
<p>我們到防空洞去，都是從容地，好像赴一個集會。眞的！可以去會會朋友們了！而且致有一個堅定的信念：「最後勝利是我們的」。</p>

<h3 id="c69">做父母的態度 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 沈雄</p>
<p>敎養孩子最要緊的是態度問題。首先第一，做父母的應該謙遜。這並非父母不如子女之謂，而是說父母對待子女應該虛心，謹愼。</p>
<p>許多父母總以爲他們的判斷是絕對正確的，這實在是大錯。我們應該記住，做父母的也有錯的時候——如果你委曲或寃枉了你的孩子，你必須懇摯地向他認錯。</p>
<p>其次是抑止情緒。孩子們看見父母的好榜樣，一定會畢着自制。做父母的整天任所欲爲，對於孩子的任性行爲則加以責罰，這豈可算是公平呢？</p>
<p>孩子們是天生的極端派。這個禮拜他愛洋娃娃，下個禮拜他却喜歡玩皮球了。父母的責任是敎導他們對工作和遊戲取一種中庸適度的態度。</p>
<p>第三是寬容。有時對孩子的錯誤是應予以寬容的。一個孩子的經騐見識有限，某些在大人眼中認爲不對的行動，他們或許是認爲合理的。所以做父母的應常常設身處地的替孩子着想。</p>
<p>但寬容却非任孩子胡天胡帝，不加管束。合理的管敎對孩子個性的發展是有很大幫助的。父母必須敎導孩子愛淸潔，守秩序，敏捷，負責任。此外父母也該敎孩子寬容別人的缺點。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>「這樣說，誰還願意當師傅呢？」她足足想了十多分鐘，才勉强想出一個自以爲很滿意的解答。「想必他們收徒弟的時候，一定不是怎樣隨便的，所以敎出來的總是好的了。」對於孟家的小內掌櫃所說的尙家的舅公肯不肯收她做徒弟的一點，梅寳倒一些不担心；雖然她在自己家裏找不到一面鏡子，但在隣家，學校裹，她至少已把自己的影子照過幾百决了，再加從小就有許多村裏的人，和學堂裏的師友不停的在對她誇獎着，她那有還會不知道自己長得是俊是醜的？何况她念了八九年的書，年年總是考的第一第二，她當然不相信唱戲會比念書更難的。</p>
<p>「別先吿訴爸，待我學了十天半月再來唱給他聽，讓他嚇一大跳！」她很天眞地這樣想，差一些就在枕上笑出來。</p>
<p>從第三天起，梅寳便開始學戲了。一個跟她向無關係的中年男子，也因孟大嫂和她公公的介紹，像一支螺旋釘一樣的開始鑽進她的生命的過程中來，這就是孟家的小內掌櫃所說的尙家舅公了。實際上，他就是孟老掌櫃的大舅子，一個半路出家，而且始終不曾在舞台上紅起來的可憐虫。不錯，他也是一個旦角，可是即使全中國唱小嗓子的角兒全死完了，也輪不到他在「宇宙風」裏去趙高的女兒；對不起，停一會角色派出來，這位仁兄所派到的還是一個啞奴。他的玩意兒怎麽樣，於此也就不難「思過半矣！」</p>
<p>然而他的玩意兒無論怎樣壤，他的運氣無論怎樣糟，眼睛總是生的；一二十年來，他在戲院子裏出出進進的亂轉，不覺就把那些大角兒的起居服食看得太淸楚了，因此而激起的那一種羨慕和妒忌的心理，也就與日俱增，如果要用文字去形容它，康熙字典上簡直還我不出適當的字。（一六八）</p>

<p>— 思文</p>
<p>在美國最爲發達，所以美國對於電影院的裝置也日新月異，時有發展。最近父有了一種新花樣，看起來雖則很像露天電影塲，但是裏面沒有舒適的坐位，所有的看客，必須自備一輛汽車，安坐在自己的車廂內，來觀看電影的映出。</p>
<p>主辦的人叫史密斯，他把它叫做停車塲電影院。院地佔地三畝，在這空曠的平地上，堅着三十尺高的鋼架，在這架上，裝着高四十八尺，闊六十五尺的銀幕，每當開映的時候，每人先納三角半的門票，然後駕車直駛塲內，依决排列，車中人靜坐在車廂內，欣賞那銀幕上的情景，很是淸晰。在這廣地上，大的可停六百輛汽車，平均每車三人計算，就得有一千八百人，但實際上，沒有普通一千八百座的　影　那麽喧鬧，而且也可省却了每個電影院必需設立一個停車塲來供應看客停車的麻煩。同時，觀客方面再也不會受到汽車盜竊的危險。</p>
<p>自從這種電影院創立後，大家都覺得有着新奇的興趣。一般聰明的電影商，就專事投合大衆的心理，如今，全美國已開設了十二所停車塲電影院，還有幾家正在設計建築，將來一定會風行一時哩！</p>

<p>— 沈明康</p>
<p>今春周信芳兩露羣英會，一人兼飾兩角，美則美矣，惜飾周瑜之一角，總覺未愜人意。嘗念是角如能屬之葉盛蘭或周維俊，正不知能精彩若干倍，今者維俊果來而信芳方輟演，因知我之理想，終不過理想，事實上初非易致也。</p>
<p>按羣英會小生一角，實較鬚生爲重，嘗見葉盛蘭領導富連成班獻藝漢臯時，輙以此劇爲標榜，兪振飛最近雖亦露過，惟略去舞劍一段，似覺有失精彩，此實用違其長，不足爲責。若論「雉尾」一路，當代除盛蘭而外，當推周維俊最出色。惜其此决來滬途中，感冒致疾，故登台第二夕之羣英會，不免稍事草率。迨病愈再露，始見鋒鋩，允以唱原板「羣英會上當醉飽」一句拔高，一氣呵成，毫不費力，而餘音嫋嫋，不絕如縷，直有繞樑三匝之概。至如舞劍身手，視其年來習武之勤，自屬勝任愉快，卡爾登當局重其藝，繼復數數煩演八大鎚雜觀樓諸劇，每貼滿座，深得觀衆激賞，比屆期滿，院方雖竭力挽留，而徐氏雙鬟復堅持不捨，故下屆蟬聯與否，尙未定奪耳。</p>

<p>— 吠聲</p>
<p>日前讀本刋老塗君」「閒話連環套一文，不禁引起筆者對於該劇的一些觀感。且把它拉雜寫在下面：</p>
<p>這裏筆者所要說的，並不是關於演技方面，而是指該劇陳義方面而言的，因爲速環套一劇的演出，大都是在表現我國固有之美德，其中黃天覇的單身拜山，這無疑地是在顯示着他的極度勇敢，和大無畏的精神，同時也顯示着他肯負責任的忠實心地，當然値得人們的欽崇！至於竇爾墩呢，能够不依仗着山寨人多勢衆而與一個毫無奧援的黃天覇當塲在山寨動武，這不但是在顯示着他的器度之宏，並且還顯示着—簡直代表了—我民族性的絕不欺凌弱小的唯一美德，該是多麼値得稱頌啊！當他和黃天覇決裂之後，可以說是已經有兩雄不並立之勢，可是他還很講求禮貌，仍舊以接天覇上山的儀式來歡送天覇下山，比到現今國際間交戰國相互交還使卽之舉，似乎也不容輕視，因爲他們之間，是無所謂相互的啊！</p>
<p>更有一事，値得注意的，便是信守問題，當竇黃二人的定明日在山下比武之間，竇爾墩所最擅用而又熟練使慣的武器—雙鈞—忽被朱光祖用智巧盜取以去，他如果爲了要置備同樣武器而要求展期，在當時的環境，並非絕對不可能的事，可是他爲了尊重信守，所謂丈夫一言，終於貿然如期踐的，雖遭慘敗，仍不失爲一個雖敗猶榮的英雄。道未嘗不是社會敎育之一助，並且還是文化宣傳的絕大輔佐呢。</p>

<p>最近有一部份在復旦，震旦，曁南，東南，南通法政各大學讀書的學生，集台愛好藝術靑年數十人，組織了一個俱樂部，定名爲「藝聲劇藝社。」藝聲包括的範圍很大，有平劇，有話劇，有歌詠，有運動，有學術，總之都是關於靑年修養方面的。</p>
<p>平劇方面，他們請海上許多名票擔任指導。話劇方面，由田振東，馬翎二人領導，現在正在排練熊佛西的劊子手」和馬翎的「鬧鐘」，這二個戲，將來都要借「辣斐」演出。歌詠，運動，學術各方面，也聘請專家指導，譬如關於聲樂的練習，游泳，溜水，技術，的訓練，以及國語，英文的研究等等。</p>
<p>現在他們已有男女社員百餘人，一大半是各大學的學生，其餘是中學生和職業界的靑年</p>
<p>這團體的立塲很是嚴正，宗旨也純潔，社務負責者是鄭雪麟和顧季雲。</p>

<p>第十三章　不肯低頭在草莽</p>
<p>柳隱英話未說畢，小婢早說道：「老太太故世了！」柳隱英聞言，把足一瞪道：「怎麽我姑母已不在人間了嗎？怎樣死的呢？」許靖也十分驚異。小婢又說道：「柳公子，你出去的時候，老太太不是方在息病嗎？决日伊不見了你，喚我到病榻邊去問。但小婢也不知道公子到那裹去的，祇說昨日有個差官送一封書信來此。老太太便料公子一定是下山殺賊去了。伊心裏更是悶悶不樂，深怪公子不肯明言，丟下伊一人在此，倘然有豺狼或是流寇到此，不將束手待斃嗎？伊心裏一發急，病就加重。恰巧夜間又有兩隻狼來門外很凄厲的叫　了多時，明天老太太的病便見危殆。小婢一個人沒有法想，祗得跑到東面石鼓峯上關王寺裏去請了智圓老和尙來給伊治病。可是服了老和尙的藥，依然無效。在前天晚上便撤手長逝了。殮葬之事，都是智圖老和尙相助小婢料理的。現在　正擱在堂中，尙未安葬呢。」小婢這樣說着柳隱央眼眶裏的眼淚早像斷綫珍珠般滴下來。許靖不勝悲嘆。二人走至中堂，柳隱英一見正中放着的靈座，蕙帳風凄，白燭淚墜，早已跪倒在座前，放聲痛哭道：「姑母，我實在是對不起你的。早知你要離開這個世界，我也不敢他去了。唉！姑丈九原有知，不要深深地資怪我不孝嗎？現在我回來了，姑母可知道嗎？但是我再也不能够瞧見你的慈容了。不孝之罪，終身遺恨，姑母你可憐我僥恕我吧。」一邊說着，露出哀痛欲絕的樣子。許靖只得在旁勸慰道：「這件事當然是你料不到的。但你離開這裏也是爲了國家，你姑父母陰魂有知，一定能够原諒你的苦衷。勸你節哀珍重爲要。」小婢却躲在旁邊只是拭淚。許靖勸了幾次，方纔勸住。（一二五）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Aggression in Vietnam Condemned in Strong Terms by the U.S. State Department, Claiming This Act Endangers Pacific Peace and Security. Economic Sanctions Widely Believed Sufficient to Mortally Wound Japan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Washington - The U.S. government today broke its silence on the Far East crisis. Undersecretary of State Welles issued a strong written statement today regarding Japan's aggression in Vietnam, denouncing Japan as an aggressor nation. He stated that Japan's actions threatened the security of the United States in the Far East (including the Philippines), and endangered U.S. access to raw materials needed for national defense. Welles' statement was approved by President Roosevelt. American and foreign reporters had expected a statement from the U.S. government today. When Welles met with the press, he immediately distributed the official statement, claiming it clarified U.S. policy. He said that Japanese Ambassador Nomura had been informed of the statement's contents during his visit to the Undersecretary yesterday. Four Japanese reporters were present at the press conference today. They remained silent after receiving the statement. Welles' statement included an excerpt from Secretary of State Hull's speech to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 15 of this year, stating that Japan has always had vast ambitions to establish a position of dominance over the entire Western Pacific. Japanese leaders have openly declared their determination to acquire and maintain this position by force, so that Japan can become the master of an area containing half of the world's population. As a result, they will be able to act arbitrarily in that region. According to past experience and current facts, the so-called "New Order" in the Pacific region means that in the political sphere, one country dominates others; in the economic sphere, the resources within the dominated area are exploited economically, ultimately impoverishing the original inhabitants of the region, while completely excluding the interests of other countries in the area; and in the social sphere, it means destroying the individual freedom of the conquered people and reducing them to a state of slavery. Welles' statement pointed out that while the Vichy government resisted Japanese pressure, the attitude of the U.S. government and people toward acts of aggression using force or backed by force is well known to the world. Welles further accused the Japanese government of being determined to use force or the threat of force to achieve its goals of expanding its sphere of influence, judging by the path it is currently following. The Japanese government's statement that its occupation of Vietnam or the establishment of bases in Vietnam is necessary for self-defense is not based on any reasonable grounds, in the U.S. government's view. At the same time, we cannot believe that Britain and the United States have any territorial ambitions in Vietnam that could pose any threat to Japan. The government now believes that Japan's establishment of bases in the area is aimed at further expansion and invasion of its neighboring areas. Judging from the development of past events, the steps taken by the Japanese government are sufficient to endanger all peaceful nations in the Pacific. Japan is taking risks because the United States has embargoed raw materials such as tin and rubber, which are essential to its domestic economy. However, Japan cannot deny the principle of equal access to tin, rubber, oil and other raw materials in the Pacific region. Japan's actions also endanger the security of other areas in the Pacific, including the Philippines. The government and people of the Philippines have consistently recognized this development as the biggest problem for their security. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th - Welles' statement regarding Japan's actions in Vietnam is considered extremely important here, as it clearly indicates that if Japan occupies Vietnam, the United States will take economic action. Some observers feel that Vichy is ready to create difficulties for Britain, as in Syria, but will not challenge others, no matter how humiliated. Now, not only is it not resisting Japan's actions in Vietnam, but it is not even protesting. If Japan and Vichy, two sovereign states, conclude an agreement, outsiders will feel it is interfering. However, Welles' statement contains an important point regarding this, recognizing Vichy as a weak country without the power to resist aggression. This statement clearly gives the United States the right to intervene in Vietnam. Welles' claim that Japan's actions endanger U.S. defense supplies can be seen as a prelude to U.S. economic sanctions against Japan. Welles, on behalf of the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, stated that there were no ambitions to covet Vietnamese territory, which can also be seen as a sign that Britain and the Netherlands will take similar actions to deal with Japan. Japan has always believed that the United States only makes empty promises without taking concrete action, but the U.S. policy statement on the Far East is now becoming increasingly strong. If Japan does not change its policy, the United States may still take action.</p>
<p>United Press, Washington, 25th - U.S. officials are awaiting the scope, content, and purpose of Japan's ultimatum to France regarding Vietnam before implementing economic countermeasures against Japan. Government economic officials indicate that these economic retaliations will be implemented quickly once the details of Japan's actions are determined. However, there is no indication that this will create a military conflict between the United States and Japan. It is generally believed that the administration will act cautiously in any steps it takes regarding this new situation. Senator George, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that there would be no rash actions. He advocated a purely American policy in the Far East, rather than joint British-American action, unless U.S. interests were involved. Undersecretary of State Welles emphasized that reports that Britain and the United States would jointly take economic and military action against Japan were not true.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Warships Discovered Outside Saigon Estuary. News Unable to be Verified. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Saigon, 25th - It is heard that Japanese warships are outside Cape Saint Jacques in the Saigon estuary. Saigon is thirty-four miles upstream on the river.</p>
<p>International News Agency, London, 25th - There are rumors that Japanese warships have been seen off the coast of Con Lon Island and Cape Saint Jacques. Officials here have been unable to confirm this. However, it is claimed that the Chongqing naval headquarters said on Wednesday that two large squadrons of Japanese warships were seen sailing south.</p>
<p>U.S. No Longer Appeasing Japan, An Important Hint from Roosevelt</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th - President Roosevelt, in an informal conversation with the Voluntary Service Committee of the Office of Civilian Defense, said that the reason the United States allowed Japan to purchase American oil in the past was to prevent Japan from seeking it from the Dutch East Indies. The United States has been doing this for two years, hoping for the sake of its own interests, for the defense of Britain, and for freedom of the seas, to prevent the war from extending to the South Pacific. Now, with the European war approaching its second year, we have been striving from the beginning to prevent the spread of the war, and the Pacific is one of the areas where we have been working. We need supplies of many goods in the South Pacific, such as the Dutch East Indies, the Straits Settlements, and Vietnam. We also need to transport Australia's surplus meat, wheat, and grains to Britain. Therefore, from a selfish point of view of our national defense, it is necessary to prevent war from breaking out in the Pacific. If American oil had not been supplied to Japan earlier, Japan would have gone south to the Dutch East Indies and started a war a year ago. Since the President used the past tense in these remarks, observers speculate that the President is now preparing to ban oil exports to Japan and take other economic sanctions.</p>

<h3 id="e3">After Japan's Occupation of Vietnam <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper has previously pointed out the new crisis in the South Pacific, believing that the situation in Vietnam was imminent. Whether what Japan was preparing was peaceful negotiations, military action, or negotiations coerced by force was unknowable. The French-Vietnamese side had neither the strength nor the intention to resist, and their past concessions and the shortsighted mentality of quenching thirst with poison were unlikely to change. As expected, the facts have confirmed our predictions. The Vichy government has agreed to Japan's "temporary occupation" of important bases and airfields in French Indochina. The Vichy spokesman's claim that it was "merely a temporary measure" to "protect Vietnam," and that "France believes that Japan's temporary occupation of Vietnamese military bases is conditional on not threatening Vietnam's integrity and France's sovereignty," are purely self-deceptive words. Their mentality of drinking poison to quench thirst is clearly revealed, and Japan's coercion of negotiations by force can be seen in these few words. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, Japan's government and the public have been hesitant and distressed, and the voices of southward and northward advances have been clamorous. After the cabinet turmoil, there were more than thirty days of uneasiness, which can be said to have come to an end with the current occupation of Vietnam.</p>
<p>What exactly is the content of this decision by the Vichy government and the agreement on Vietnam established with Japan? We have not seen it yet and cannot speculate. However, according to unconfirmed news reports, Japanese troops have already entered six strongholds in Vietnam and occupied two airfields. News from Hanoi also stated that what Japan is demanding is the convenience of using southern Vietnam. Judging from the current development of the situation, we can conclude that what Vichy has promised Japan is extremely broad, and almost the entire Vietnam has been sold out. Regarding Japan's future moves after occupying Vietnam, judging from Japan's past opportunistic policies, it seems unlikely to immediately advance rapidly and start a major war with Britain and the United States in the South Pacific. There are several possible explanations for this: First, Japan does not want to offend Britain and the United States before the European war situation undergoes drastic changes. However, in order to cope with the pressure from the Axis allies, it occupied Vietnam and, on the surface, gathered a large army in southern Vietnam, forming a posture of a major southward advance to contain Britain and the United States, and to fulfill its obligations to the Allied countries. In fact, it took the opportunity to benefit and carry out its "peaceful southward advance" plan, and then develop it slowly. Second, Vietnam's resources are no less than those of the Dutch East Indies. In terms of agricultural products, its rice production ranks fourth in the world, with an annual output of about 4.5 to 5 million tons. The rubber production managed by the French also reaches 69,000 tons per year. As for the famous mineral resources, the Hong Gai anthracite alone produces 2.3 million tons per year, with reserves of 1.1 billion tons. There are also small amounts of tin, antimony, tungsten, and other mineral resources, which are all raw materials necessary for national defense. Japan's domestic resources are currently being depleted. Now that it has seized Vietnam, it can take whatever it wants, engage in development, and obtain vast resources at a very low price, which is extremely satisfying. Why wait for a major southward advance and take a risky adventure? Third, Japan's occupation of Vietnam, in addition to seizing resources, its military significance cannot be ignored. The most important thing for Japan is Cam Ranh Bay, which is located northeast of Saigon, on the coast of Da Lat, Vietnam's summer resort. It is surrounded by barriers on three sides, and the port is secluded and deep, making it a good base for the navy. It is located in the middle of Hong Kong, Manila, and Singapore, and occupies an extremely important position in the South Pacific. In 1905, the Russian Imperial Baltic Fleet once berthed here, calling it a good port. Later, the Vietnamese government planned to move the capital to Da Lat and wholeheartedly manage this excellent military port, but due to procrastination and complacency, and the rapid changes in the world, it was not successful. Today, after acquiring this excellent port, the military will devote all its energy to developing it as the vanguard of the Japanese navy in the Pacific. However, building a military port is not easy, and it will take years to complete. Therefore, the Japanese military only needs to feign strength and give Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies a major threat, and it is not yet time to launch a major advance immediately. Fourth, Japan is an opportunist who does not want to offend Britain and the United States; at the same time, it also knows that Britain and the United States do not want to start a war lightly. Therefore, it has acquired an advantageous position and is quietly waiting for the evolution of the world situation, so that it can bargain in the future. In the event that the European war situation is favorable to the democratic front, Japan can also calmly negotiate prices from its existing position. Fifth, since Japan's invasion of China, it has now entered its fifth year. The prolonged hardship of the military and the resentment of the people at home need not be discussed in detail. The reason why troops are stationed in the South China Sea and Vietnam are seized is to appease the Japanese people, believing that they have now achieved a major military and political victory, thereby easing the passionate public sentiment. In summary, after occupying Vietnam, Japan seems likely to go through a certain period before making other moves, just like the situation after the signing of the Hanoi Agreement last year.</p>
<p>However, what is the reaction of the United States to this action by Japan? Will the United States continue to adopt a policy of appeasement in the future? Or will it continue to put on a show of temporary anger with "a lot of thunder, but little rain"? According to the news we have obtained so far, the United States will implement economic countermeasures once Japan's actions are decided. U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles also sternly condemned Japan as an aggressor and believed that Japan's occupation of Vietnam was the last threat to U.S. supply of defense raw materials and to the Philippines. Japan has always thought that the United States only makes empty promises and does not take practical action, but this time the severity of the U.S. attitude is very different from the past. Therefore, it can be said that the crisis in the South Pacific will become even more serious in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e4">It is Reported That the Main Clauses for Letting Japan Occupy Bases in Vietnam Have Been Signed <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Hanoi, 25th - Most of the Japanese envoys currently in Hanoi are scheduled to depart for Saigon on July 27. It is heard that the main clauses of the agreement to give Japan bases in southern Vietnam have been signed in Vichy, and the details agreed upon in Hanoi on Wednesday are expected to take effect next week. Although no news is available, officials believe that Vichy's concessions may include granting Japan the right to station troops in southern Vietnam and occupy naval bases and airfields.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hanoi - According to non-official sources obtained by Reuters, Japanese troops may occupy airfields and bases and station troops in southern Vietnam on July 29.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Vichy, 25th - Officials here announced this morning that a Franco-Japanese agreement on defense measures in Vietnam is expected to be signed in the near future. It is expected that the full text of the agreement will be announced tomorrow.</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 25th - France and Japan reached an agreement in principle yesterday on the issue of bases in Vietnam. The agreement stipulates that Japan and France have the same rights to prevent the Sino-British-American bloc from establishing bases in Vietnam. As for the reports of the establishment of the agreement, an official spokesman said it was still too early, and the two sides were still negotiating yesterday, and most of the talks were technical.</p>
<p>Reuters, Hanoi, 25th - Hanoi's "Vietnam Will" newspaper recently published an editorial authorized by high-ranking officials, which openly referred to the agreement to give Japan bases in southern Vietnam for the first time, stating that the agreement was not made against any country and was only temporary in nature. France's sovereignty in Vietnam is not affected. Vietnam's geographical location is on the way to the Dutch East Indies and Singapore, and Japan cannot continue its southward expansion policy from Hainan Island, Taiwan, occupied areas in China, or Japan's distant bases. The agreement was directly negotiated between Vichy and Tokyo, and France's intention in signing the agreement was to prevent Vietnam from becoming a battlefield, so it was willing to make temporary concessions that seemed painful.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 25th - Reuters' Far East chief correspondent said that the Hanoi "Vietnam Will" newspaper's editorial on Thursday was deeply felt in this area, as the public had been humiliated three times and was in inner torment. It is generally felt that if Vichy had allowed Vietnam to deal with the situation on its own, it would not have suffered this humiliation. Reuters has learned from extremely reliable sources that the Far East Democratic Front recently suggested to the Vietnamese authorities that Vietnam be allowed to enjoy the privileges of the U.S.-British-Chinese-Dutch front to resist continued external encroachment. In other words, the democratic front has guaranteed to back Vietnam, just as it has backed the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch East Indies, with this backing, has proven its effectiveness in the face of Japan's recent intimidation. However, the Vietnamese authorities did not accept or reject this suggestion. After a little consideration, they simply ignored it, leaving Vietnam isolated and helpless at the final moment. Japan's expansion of power into southern Vietnam has naturally caused serious potential changes in the Far East military situation. A glance at the map shows that the air base in southern Vietnam and the naval base of Cam Ranh Bay, together with Japan's southernmost bases in the Tokyo area and Hainan Island, are closer to Burma, Malaya, Borneo, and are a more serious threat to traffic between the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. However, the immediate threat should not be overestimated. The triangular area of southern Vietnam closest to Malaya is covered with rice fields and is flooded every year in June. Therefore, the closest location for the Japanese to establish an effective air base is near Saigon. The flying time from Saigon to Singapore is 600 miles, to North Borneo 750 miles, and to Rangoon 900 miles. As for the maritime base, Saigon can be used immediately, but Saigon is located upstream, and only light cruisers can reach the dock. As for Cam Ranh Bay, which has been repeatedly touted, it is currently just an empty and useless place. The bay is surrounded by a hook-shaped land, with only a narrow channel for access. It is one of the world's best natural harbors, but it requires extensive engineering to make it practical.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Japan's New Act of Aggression Threatens British Interests in the Far East. Vichy's Humiliation, Eden's Painful Words. China and Britain Maintain Diplomatic Contact <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - Foreign Secretary Eden, in a speech today in the House of Commons, foreshadowed Japanese actions in Vietnam, stating that the Japanese government had demanded of Vichy the occupation of naval and air bases in northern Vietnam. Although there is no official news yet regarding the formal agreement between Japan and Vichy for the continued occupation of bases by Japanese forces, these two matters are increasingly apparent. This new act of aggression by Japan has long been premeditated. Two days ago, I refuted the absurd rumors that Britain intended to invade Vietnam. Such propaganda has become a prelude to every new atrocity committed by the Axis powers and their allies. In the current situation, the fact that Japan's occupation of bases in southern Vietnam was permitted by Vichy does not obscure the fact that Japan achieved its objective through demands and threats. The pitiful situation of the Vichy government in responding to these demands is yet another example of the rewards of cooperating with the Axis powers. The British government views this development as a potential threat to its territories and interests in the Far East. Having anticipated this, it has been in close contact with the United States, the Netherlands, and the governments of various Dominions (cheers). The US government's attitude has been affirmatively expressed publicly by Acting Secretary of State Welles. I am confident that this House will welcome these timely and beneficial remarks. Today, I do not intend to elaborate on the measures the British government has prepared to address this and other possible developments. I will release further information as soon as possible. However, it is immediately clear that, given the explicit threat to our territories implied by Japan's actions, certain defensive measures have already been implemented in Malaya. At this point, Labour MP Lawrence interjected, asking, "Have you not mentioned any cooperation with the Chinese government?" The Foreign Secretary replied, "I do not intend to elaborate further on that." Another MP then asked, "Have you received any information that South African interests will be affected?" The Foreign Secretary replied that this matter may be determined by the South African government, but the direct threat is clearly to territories closer to Vietnam. Liberal MP Maxton also asked, "Was China consulted on this matter?" The Foreign Secretary replied, "My remarks are not intended to focus on one country." Another MP followed, asking, "Why can't you tell us whether you will consult with China?" The Foreign Secretary replied, "We have always maintained diplomatic contact with China. I do not wish to disclose the specific measures I have in mind today, which are indeed related to other governments. Our attitude towards China remains the same."</p>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 25th - People here are not surprised by Japan's recent southward advance, as this move was long expected. Private sources, considered reliable, suggest that a large number of Japanese troops have withdrawn from Guangzhou. Well-informed observers believe that Japan's subsequent actions remain uncertain, as the occupation of southern Vietnam can either be used to attack Yunnan Province to cut off the Burma Road or to threaten the interests of the democratic nations. All Chinese-language newspapers are paying close attention to this development, believing it may lead to a conflict between Britain and Japan.</p>
<p>Economic Pressure to Be Applied to Japan; US and British Governments Reach Agreement</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - British newspapers today are all criticizing Japan's invasion of Vietnam, with headlines such as "Japan Invades Vietnam." The Times states that Konoe is choosing the weak to devour, using Vietnam as a base to expand its "New Order in East Asia." The Japanese occupation of Vietnam is expected to be formally announced by the end of the week. The governments of China, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, India, and Thailand must closely monitor Japan's future actions against these countries. According to Washington sources, the US State Department and the British Foreign Office have a clear understanding of the danger, and the two governments are in complete agreement on a plan to resist Japan, which will be done through economic pressure. The Daily Mail states that Japan is acting cleverly, abandoning its northward attack and advancing south, both flattering Hitler and benefiting itself. Occupying any part of Vietnam cannot be described as an act of hostility against Britain and the United States or as an action that will lead to a larger war. However, if Konoe and his colleagues believe that Britain will allow Japan to use Vietnam as a base to attack the British Empire, they are greatly mistaken. The British government has consulted with the United States and the Dominions to formulate a strict economic sanctions plan to prevent Japan from infringing on its rights. Welles' denunciation of Japan last night can be seen as a warning. No country in the world is more dependent on trade for its livelihood than Japan. Tokyo should know that if militarism continues rampant and infringes on the rights of Britain and the United States, the embargo by Britain and the United States will be sufficient to restrain it. The Berkshire Gazette states that Japan's actions directly threaten the United States, as America's important supplies of tin and rubber will now be affected. Welles' remarks imply that Japan should not antagonize Britain.</p>
<p>China Will Consider Participating in the Defense of the Burma Road Only Upon British Request</p>
<p>Reuters, Chongqing, 25th - During the regular press briefing this afternoon, a question was posed to the Chinese military spokesman, asking whether Chinese troops would participate in the defense of the Burma Road if Japanese forces invaded Thailand and Burma to cut off the Burma Road and attack the rear of Singapore. The spokesman replied that if Japanese forces invaded Chinese territory, the Chinese army would naturally defend the Chinese border. As for the question of whether the Chinese army would participate in a foreign war, it could only arise after receiving a request from the British government. If such a request is received, the Chinese Supreme Command will consider it.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies and Malaya Are Fully Prepared to Deal with Any Future Eventuality</p>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 25th - According to semi-official sources here, the Dutch East Indies, while willing to maintain peace and tranquility today and in the future, is prepared and determined to implement any steps necessary to defend its independence or the fulfillment of its obligations. There is no official news yet whether Japan's actions in Vietnam will change the Dutch East Indies' peaceful relations with other countries in the Far East. However, should there be a drastic change in the overall situation, the Dutch East Indies will take action accordingly. This has been fully stated by Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens during his travels to the Far East, Australia, and the United States, and there is no need to elaborate further.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 25th - Officials have announced that the authorities in the Malay Peninsula have taken various precautionary measures to deal with any eventuality.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 25th - Regarding the crisis in Vietnam, local sources state that, regardless of any developments in the Far East or on the Thai border, Thailand is determined to maintain its neutrality and independence. Neutral observers are paying close attention to the significant words in Prime Minister Sangkram's address to the Thai troops heading to the ceded territories in Vietnam, in which he stated, "If it is unavoidable and you must face your duties with weapons, then you must do so with great courage and determination."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - One of the things Japan coveted in its southward advance was the oil of the Dutch East Indies, but it has been deterred by the Dutch East Indies' preparations. According to a dispatch from Batavia published by the Free Netherlands newspaper in London, all locations of military importance in the Dutch East Indies, including oil fields and ports, have been garrisoned and are closed to foreigners. The Home Guard will concentrate on protecting the oil fields. Thousands of women have registered to serve in wartime. According to this year's conscription plan, 600,000 natives will be drafted.</p>
<p>Vichy Policy Is Based on Reality; Protecting Vietnam Relies on Japan</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 24th - Regarding the outcome of the talks between France and Japan on the Vietnam issue, no official communique has been issued here as of 8 p.m. tonight. Although it is uncertain whether officials will issue such a communique, reporters generally believe that officials will almost certainly make a statement. At this time, what is generally known is that France and Japan are continuing to exchange views through diplomatic channels. Those in charge are no longer completely silent on this matter and state that, if necessary, France and Japan may take certain steps in the short term, based on the Franco-Japanese agreement of August last year, within the scope of Franco-Japanese cooperation to protect Vietnam. According to this agreement, France will recognize Japan's special rights to protect "Greater East Asia." Well-informed sources say that if the French government takes such steps, it will be based on a realistic viewpoint. The so-called realistic viewpoint is that France lacks sufficient strength in Vietnam to fulfill its responsibilities for protection. Therefore, the government is considering Japan's request to obtain certain military advantages in Vietnam. This Japanese request is based on rumors from Tokyo that Vietnam is threatened by foreign powers, and the government is studying it within the scope of ensuring the fate of French colonies and the principle of the territorial integrity of Vietnam.</p>
<p>United Press, Vichy, 25th - A government spokesman stated that negotiations are currently underway in Vichy and Hanoi. He said that an agreement has not yet been signed, but a foundation has been established. France has reaffirmed Japan's superior position in Asia, and its military and technological superiority in Asia is sufficient for Japan to "maintain order in East Asia." The spokesman said that General Decoux, Governor-General of Vietnam, held a two-hour talk in Hanoi with Major General Sumita, head of the Japanese military delegation to Vietnam, to review the contents of the Japanese military plan for the "temporary occupation of military key points." The spokesman said that "the recognition of Japan's superiority in East Asia does not mean that Germany will similarly recognize any other powerful nation's position in French Africa. In the agreement being drafted, Japan reaffirms its guarantee of the territorial integrity of Vietnam and French sovereignty."</p>
<p>Free French Will Never Recognize Vichy Authorities' Acts of Humiliation and Betrayal</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - The Commissioner for Overseas Territories of Free France issued a statement in London regarding the agreement between Vichy and Japan on Vietnam, stating that Free France will never recognize the concessions made by the Vichy government in French colonies. The agreement between Vichy and Japan, which first ceded Vietnam to Japan, is an act of "sacrificing national heritage" that has aroused unanimous indignation among Free French. General de Gaulle and the Defense Council of the French Empire declared in March that any concessions made by Vichy in the colonies, especially in Vietnam, would be considered invalid. The Vichy government decided to fight Free French and British forces in Syria, but in Vietnam, it does not resist Japan's ambitions. Japan's "protection" caused France to lose its effective sovereignty over Tonkin in September last year and ceded large areas of Cambodia and Laos to Siam in March. Now Vichy is using Japanese intervention as an excuse to incite French public opinion against China and Britain. Pétain recently solemnly declared that he would defend all territories of the French Empire, but the next day, news of new concessions in Vietnam was heard. Vichy has so far been willingly or unwillingly a tool of the Axis powers. This can be further evidenced by comparing Vichy's attitude in Vietnam and in Syria. The so-called sovereignty of the Vichy regime is merely a pretext for serving German interests.</p>
<p>US Newspapers Urge Japan to Repent Early, Warn That Causing War Will Lead to Misfortune</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th - Newspaper editorials today indicate that Japan's actions in Vietnam have aroused US public opinion that is unfavorable to Japan. The New York Times states that the Japanese government should be made aware that its acts of aggression in Siberia, the Dutch East Indies, or French Vietnam will inevitably invite swift retaliation from the United States. The United States has direct and legitimate interests in these places, as Siberia is geographically related to the United States, the Dutch East Indies are economically related to the United States, and Vietnam is strategically related to the United States. France's concessions will harm British naval power, and Britain is our natural ally in the Pacific and our barrier against Germany in the Atlantic. The Japanese government is greatly mistaken if it believes that we cannot take effective steps to stop or punish its continued acts of aggression in the Pacific. We still have a strong fleet in the Pacific. We can cut off its supplies. Once we completely ban trade with Japan, we can destroy its purchasing power in the world and its domestic economy. We should immediately focus on dealing a fatal blow to Japanese industry, commerce, and finance to retaliate against any actions that endanger legitimate US interests in the Far East. The Washington Post states that the new threat posed by Japan in Vietnam shows that the Japanese militarists still hold the view that Europe's difficulties are Japan's opportunities. The Vichy government has repeatedly allowed its troops to be slaughtered in Syria under its trusteeship, but now, under Nazi direction, it does not dare to lift a finger to protect its Vietnamese colony. Other newspapers also state that it is highly questionable whether Japan can obtain bases, food, minerals, and raw materials in Vietnam at the low price it expects. If such actions lead to a Pacific war, Japan may be completely ruined. May Tokyo aggressors not think that the US government and people will ultimately be tolerant. Be aware that once a war starts, it will not be stopped by Japan. It is hoped that Japan will stop at the precipice and not bring disaster upon itself.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Spokesman Explains Attitude Toward Germany and the Soviet Union, Says There Is a Clear Distinction Between Allies and Friendly Nations; Japan Has Not Abandoned Adjusting Relations With the United States <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th - At today's press briefing by the Information Bureau, Deputy Spokesman Ishii was absent due to illness and was represented by Section Chief Kiishi to answer questions. When asked about reports that a Vichy spokesman had announced that the French government had agreed to Japan's request to use military bases, including various airfields in Vietnam, Kiishi replied that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was awaiting information from the Vichy government. When asked about rumors that the Privy Council would hold an extraordinary meeting at the end of the week, Kiishi replied that the meeting might discuss the international situation. When asked whether Japan had given assurances to the Soviet Union after the formation of the third Konoe cabinet, Kiishi said that Japan was prepared to give any friendly nation assurances of maintaining good relations. The questioner continued, stating that, given the fact that Foreign Minister Toyoda had assured the German and Italian ambassadors that the cabinet reshuffle would not affect Japan's policy toward the Axis powers, whether Japan had already or would assure the Soviet Union of Japan's continued adherence to neutrality. Kiishi replied that Japan was not planning to give the Soviet Union any special assurances regarding the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact, as the Soviet Union was not an ally of Japan. There is a distinction between allied nations and friendly nations. Japan and the Soviet Union only have the Neutrality Pact, which cannot make the Soviet Union an ally of Japan. The Soviet government has not assured the Japanese government that its policy toward Japan will not change, so the third Konoe cabinet has not yet given the Soviet Union any special assurances. When asked about a New York dispatch in the Asahi Shimbun, stating that the Anglo-Soviet military agreement might lead to China, the Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies organizing a united front to encircle Japan, Kiishi replied that this depended entirely on the attitude of the Soviet Union. When asked whether Japan felt dissatisfied with the attitudes of Thailand and Vietnam, Kiishi replied that, as of now, the attitudes of the Thai and Vietnamese governments toward Japan were satisfactory. However, some non-governmental elements, including the pro-French de Gaullists in Vietnam, had a rather dissatisfied attitude. When asked whether the Japanese government had received official information confirming reports that Britain and China were preparing to invade Vietnam by force, Kiishi replied that this matter was naturally difficult to confirm. Kiishi continued that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura had met with US Secretary of State Welles on July 23, and that Japanese officials in Washington had repeatedly spoken with State Department officials in the past two weeks. When asked whether there was still room for talks between the United States and Japan, as reported by the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, Kiishi replied in the affirmative. The criticisms in the newspapers were not new, as the Japanese government had never abandoned hope of adjusting relations with the United States, and talks with the United States would not conflict with Japan's international responsibilities to other countries.</p>

<p>Reuters, San Francisco, 25th - Former Republican presidential candidate Willkie said in a speech here last night that the defense of freedom must be an active event. Hitler has challenged our freedom. We cannot sit in a corner and wait for him to attack. We must boldly advance to defeat Hitler. Active defense naturally involves significant sacrifices. We should aid China to tie down Japan and divide its forces, and we should double our aid to Britain. The United States should continue to acquire naval and air bases to protect the Atlantic supply lines, and the ship and aircraft routes in the South Atlantic should also be defended to prevent Germany from acting through Spain and Portugal. Once totalitarianism is surrounded, the Nazi tide, which has reached its peak, will decline. History proves that this kind of power can only survive in expansion.</p>
<p>United Press, San Francisco, 25th - Republican leader Willkie told reporters yesterday that he believed the United States should ban oil exports to Japan. Willkie also said, "In my opinion, the United States should have taken this step long ago."</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th - Secretary of War Stimson told reporters yesterday that prominent isolationist Senator Wheeler had sent postcards to army officers, urging them to oppose US participation in the war. This action, even if not treasonous, was a sinister move to undermine the country. A total of one million of these postcards were printed, printed by the Government Printing Office, but noted that they were not printed with government funds. Sending this petition to soldiers is indeed an act of sabotage, as Army Chief of Staff Marshall called it. Marshall had previously said that someone was undermining efforts to induce soldiers to oppose the extension of military service.</p>

<p>Chongqing - Foreign Minister Guo issued the following statement on the 25th regarding the Japanese government's seizure of naval, land, and air bases in southern Vietnam: "The Japanese government is now exerting its pressure, obtaining from the French government naval, land, and air bases in southern Vietnam. This action is an expansion of Japan's conquest of Vietnam and an advancement of its southward policy. From now on, all of Vietnam should be regarded as a Japanese military occupation area. This development not only continues to threaten China's southwestern border but also endangers the rights and territories of other powerful nations in the Western Pacific. Therefore, the impact on other countries is exactly the same as on China. The Chinese government must do its utmost to fulfill its responsibility, vigorously implement the national policy of resisting aggression, and promote the failure of Japan's adventurous actions. The Chinese government and people are deeply convinced that it and the countries concerned will not tolerate Japan's expanding its aggression, making the entire Western Pacific situation worse, or even falling into an unmanageable situation."

<h3 id="e19">Unprecedented Water Conservancy Construction in Southern Shaanxi: Han-Hui Canal Completed and Water Released, Canal Length 31 Kilometers, Irrigating Over 100,000 Mu, Fifth Canal Among Newly Built Canals in Shaanxi - Yi Qing <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Hanzhong, this newspaper) Southern Shaanxi, nestled between the Bashan Mountains and the Qinling Mountains, is a long and narrow basin. The main river, the Han River, has a riverbed that is too low, so farmers are accustomed to drawing water from upstream to irrigate their fields, unlike the people in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River who use waterwheels to draw water. As a result, the Han River is only suitable for boat traffic and lacks irrigation benefits. However, the tributaries on both sides, the streams in the deep valleys, are all used to divert water into the fields. For larger rivers, dams are built to block water and canals are dug to divert the flow, expanding water conservancy. As a result, irrigation has long been well-developed, and the abundance of rice production is second to none among the agricultural regions of northwestern China. Unfortunately, the farmers have enjoyed the benefits of this type of canal irrigation for so long that they have developed a lazy reliance on the weather. Over time, the old dams have fallen into disrepair, and there is waterless canals. Local disputes over water arise from time to time, but there is no comprehensive initiative to develop new water sources. Every time the rainfall is untimely, drought occurs.</p>
<p>Han River Irrigation</p>
<p>Around 1922, the late water conservancy expert Li Yishe advocated the construction of the Jing-Hui Canal. In 1930, the provincial government implemented the construction, and in 1932, it received funding from the China International Famine Relief Commission. The canal was completed and water arrived, greatly benefiting agricultural land and demonstrating significant effectiveness. Guanzhong and northern Shaanxi then began to pay attention to farmland water conservancy, following Li's advocacy and competing to build new canals. The Zhinü, Wei-Hui, Mei-Hui, Luo-Hui, and Hei-Hui canals were constructed one after another. In southern Shaanxi, the provincial government established a water conservancy administration in 1934 to improve old dams. In 1935, Li Yishe proposed a ten-year water conservancy plan for southern Shaanxi, including irrigation, navigation, and hydropower. For irrigation, he suggested building the Han-Hui, Bao-Hui, Ding-Hui, and Li-Hui canals, estimating that after the plan was completed, the benefited land area would exceed 8 million mu. Since the start of the war, the Southern Shaanxi Water Conservancy Bureau has further adapted to the needs and, starting in 1938, carried out work to improve the Jialing River waterway and build the Han and Bao canals. In addition, because the flow of the Xu River is very large, the old dams could not fully store and release water during the rice transplanting season along the canals. Therefore, it was proposed to add the Xu-Hui Canal to make full use of the water. Now, in addition to the Jialing River waterway, which was completed last year, and the Xu-Hui Canal, which is still under planning, the Jing, Wei, Mei, and Zhi canals, which were built before the Han-Hui Canal, have long been completed. The Luo and Hei canals, as well as the Bao, Ding, and Li canals, which were built after the construction of the Han-Hui Canal, have not yet been completed. The Han-Hui Canal, the fifth water canal in Shaanxi, was completed and water was released on the first day of this month (July). The people of Hanzhong, accustomed to the old ways, have broken the ancient saying, "The Han River does not irrigate the fields." The water conservancy of southern Shaanxi is gradually changing its old appearance. The benefits will last for a thousand years, and the credit lies in the people's livelihood. The reporter witnessed this grand event and collected the following outline of the canal.</p>
<p>Construction Process</p>
<p>The canal is 31 kilometers long and located on the north bank of the Han River's upper reaches in Mian County and Baocheng. 21 kilometers of it flow through Mian County, and the rest is within Baocheng. The starting point of the canal, where water is drawn from the Han River, is near the Wuhou Temple in Mian County. The project was implemented and built under the direction of Jiang Dingwen, the recently resigned chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government. The Construction Department sent Chief Engineer Liu Zhongrui to begin surveying and designing in December 1938, and construction began in February 1940. As of the end of May this year, all the projects have been completed as scheduled, except for a small portion of the zero-house project, which will be completed by the end of the year. A grand water release ceremony was held on July 1 to announce its completion. The total engineering cost was 1,886,407 yuan. It is commendable that such a great achievement could be accomplished during wartime, when the provincial treasury was tight and resources were scarce. The gentry, people, and masses of the two counties undertook the engineering work and fought hard throughout, without a single complaint. This shows that the officials and people in every corner of the great rear have transformed from their past habits of inaction and self-deception to vigorous and constructive endeavors, which is particularly gratifying.</p>
<p>Key Points of the Project</p>
<p>According to Chief Engineer Liu Zhongrui, the effectiveness of the various projects of the Han Canal is as follows: (1) The water intake of the Han Canal uses a dam to stop the small water of the Han River to facilitate diversion. However, the shape of the top of the dam is designed to allow water to roll over it. If the flood exceeds the amount of water required by the canal, the excess water can roll over the top of the dam. Downstream of the dam, energy dissipation equipment is used to counter the waves of the flood to avoid damaging the dam. The height of the top of the dam is 581.65 meters above sea level. That is, the highest water level of the flood entering the canal is 581.65 meters. (2) The height of the bottom of the canal at the starting point of the Han Canal's water intake is 579.5 meters, which is 2.1 meters lower than the top of the dam. There are three water intake gates, each 2.5 meters wide, with a maximum water intake area of 15 square meters, used to divert 11 cubic meters of water per second, which is more than sufficient. (3) After the water enters the canal from the Han River, the flow rate is not consistent due to different engineering equipment. In the earthen canal, it travels approximately 0.6 meters per second, which means that the canal water travels 1.1 kilometers per hour. Therefore, after the canal was completed, it took less than three days for the water to reach the Huangsha River. The water flow is neither too fast nor too slow, so as to prevent scouring of the canal banks or ice accumulation of sediment. (4) The height of the ground along the canal is indicated by contour lines on the plan. Farmers can use the plan to determine where canal water can be diverted and where it cannot. For example, if the canal water flows to a certain number of wading bridges in Yinjiagou, the height of the bottom of the canal is 577.97 meters. This indicates that all farmland planted above 577.9 meters above sea level cannot be irrigated, and those below 577.9 meters can be irrigated. (5) The source of the canal water is the flow of the Han River, with a maximum diversion capacity of 11 cubic meters per second. If 11 cubic meters are used to irrigate the entire Han Canal area, one irrigation cycle can be completed within ten days. However, since the test water began in June this year, the flow of the Han River has been as low as 3 cubic meters per second, and only 2 cubic meters were diverted due to construction reasons. Therefore, as of the end of June, only 40,000 mu of land had been irrigated. If the amount of diverted water next spring after the Qingming Festival is still similar to this year, it will be sufficient to support the transplanting of rice seedlings in the entire area.</p>
<p>Estimated Benefits</p>
<p>According to the survey and estimate in 1938, within the irrigation area of the Han Canal, the average price of paddy fields was approximately 80 yuan per mu, and the average price of dry land was approximately 40 yuan. The net profit per mu of paddy fields was approximately 20 yuan, and the net profit of dry land was approximately 6-7 yuan. Now that the Han Canal is completed, it can irrigate more than 100,000 mu of land. Excluding the original 30,000 mu of paddy fields, the benefited land area has increased by more than 70,000 mu. The annual agricultural output will increase by 1.2 shi of rice per mu, which is equivalent to 4.8 sheng of rice. Based on the current price (440-450 yuan per shi of rice), the net profit will increase by 300 yuan per mu, for a total increase of 48,000 shi of rice, with a net profit of 21 million yuan. The difference in land price between dry land converted to paddy fields, with a minimum of 500 yuan per mu, the total increase in land price is 35 million yuan.</p>

It has now been ascertained that on July 23, our air force destroyed a total of 58 enemy aircraft in air combat and bombing enemy airfields. We lost 19 aircraft. Also, on the night of July 23, enemy aircraft attacked and shot down 5 of them.</p>
<p>Havas, Swedish Capital, 24th: The war between Germany and the Soviet Union in the northern region is becoming increasingly fierce. According to Moscow sources, both sides are fiercely contesting the key route between Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega in the area of Petrozavodsk, on the north bank of Lake Ladoga. According to Berlin sources, the Red Army's resistance on the east bank of Lake Ladoga collapsed three days ago. As for the Finnish troops, they are attempting to break through the Red Army's defensive line on the north bank of Lake Ladoga via the town of Salmi in southwestern Finland, from north to south, and then proceed to Olonets and Svir via the Karelian Isthmus. German sources also claim that their advance troops have reached the town of Gatchina, 50 kilometers south of Leningrad, while their main force is advancing on the east bank of Lake Peipus.</p>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 25th: The Soviet Information Bureau released a war report stating, "On the 24th, there was continued fierce fighting in the areas of Petrozavodsk, Bokov, Porozek, Nevel, Smolensk, and Zhitomir. The Soviet Air Force assisted ground forces in combat, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy."</p>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 25th: A diary was found on a captured German soldier named Siekberg, in which he wrote: "The situation has been serious for the past four days. Our division's soldiers have suffered heavy air raids. This morning, red bombers flew at low altitude and attacked us. We all thought the end was near. They flew in formations of six planes, appearing more than nine times. It is reported that four cannons of our division were destroyed, and all the artillerymen have been captured by Russian infantry. 264 soldiers from the 35th Regiment and the 119th Regiment who were fighting together were also captured. We are now in a dangerous situation. I pray to heaven to have mercy on us innocent people and preserve our lives." This proves that Hitler's so-called "invincible German army" is not true.</p>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 25th: Documents found on enemy prisoners show that the Red Army soldiers and guerrillas operating in the enemy's rear have caused great alarm among the enemy. One of the orders was signed by General von Kleist, which read: "Reports of Soviet tanks breaking into our army's rear have caused alarm. Therefore, it is ordered that anyone who causes alarm or confusion among the troops will be punished for disobedience and cowardice. In situations of alarm, all officers must act strictly. Weapons may be used when necessary. During periods of alert, it is forbidden to shout phrases such as 'Soviet troops have broken in.'"</p>
<p>Germany Admits Russian Ferocity Unprecedented in History</p>
<p>Tass, London, 25th: According to British intelligence sources, the German "Frankfurter Zeitung" published an article on the developments of the Soviet-German front. This article is absolutely different from the self-congratulatory reports published by other German sources. The newspaper directly admitted that the reports of German victory were "without factual basis." The newspaper stated, "Although we believe that some fortresses have been occupied by our side, artillery fire suddenly emerges from the fortresses when the German soldiers are unprepared. The Russians are resisting with secret fortresses. Therefore, we are suffering battles again in the occupied territory." The newspaper indicated that the spirit of Russian's strong resistance can only be described as "intense" and believes that the breadth of the current battlefield is unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>German Tank Commander-in-Chief Killed by Soviet Mobile Unit</p>
<p>Tass, Moscow, 25th: The German command has finally announced that German Tank Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Lanzel has indeed died. A Soviet guerrilla aimed a shot and ended his lifetime of murderous career. According to the Haitian News Agency, Lanzel was suddenly attacked by guerrillas in the rear. When he heard the gunshot, he fled in haste, but it was too late and he met his inglorious end.</p>
<p>German Side Announces that Soviet Troops East of Zhitomir Have Been Broken Through</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 25th: Well-informed sources said yesterday that the resistance of the Soviet troops east of Zhitomir had been crushed by the German army the day before. Two teams of German shock troops had broken into the last part of the Stalin Line in the area. Both sides of the nine-kilometer-long Soviet front line in the area had been broken by the German army, which was like angry waves. The well-informed sources said that on Thursday morning, the German artillery fired intense artillery fire in the broken area. Then, the vanguard fiercely attacked the Soviet sentry posts and machine gun emplacements with flamethrower tanks and high-explosive shells. Countless new cannons and automatic weapons were captured in the battle, and 280 Soviet troops were captured. However, all the Soviet troops in the sentry posts died, and none were captured. On other fronts, the German and Romanian armies captured a village, then another village, captured a city, and then another city, closely pursuing the Soviet troops. The Bolshevik army set fire to and burned each city and village into scorched earth as they retreated.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 25th: As the German High Command broadly announced that the war on the Eastern Front was proceeding according to plan, people in Germany and neutral countries here have recently acknowledged that the Soviet Union's life-for-life resistance seems to be prolonging the war. These people believe that the Soviet Union may defend Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev to the death, and are unwilling to declare these cities as undefended cities. They are keenly interested in observing the future development of the war. Germans generally believe that the Soviet Union's tactics are not very beneficial and only cause widespread suffering. However, they all believe that the war will inevitably be prolonged as a result. The High Command said that fierce battles continued in some areas, and the German army captured prisoners every day. Well-informed German sources said that Soviet cities are extremely vulnerable to air raids because most of the houses are made of wood. The German airmen who raided the Soviet capital said that the fire caused by the air raid in Moscow the previous night had not yet stopped.</p>
<p>United Press, Berlin, 25th: Sources here say that the German army continued to engage in the war of mopping up the surrounded Soviet troops in the rear of the Eastern Front yesterday, but the High Command only said that the war was proceeding according to plan, without mentioning any progress made by the German army. They also acknowledged that the Soviet troops were resisting fiercely everywhere.</p>
<p>Italian Newspapers Admit that the German Army's Advance Prospects are No Longer Optimistic</p>
<p>United Press, Rome, 25th: The Mashakiro newspaper warned people yesterday not to be optimistic about the war against the Soviet Union and pointed out that the German army's progress has been obviously hindered by the stubborn Soviet resistance. The newspaper said that we cannot but admit that the battles on the Eastern Front are the most intense wherever the German army breaks through the Stalin Line. This is because the Soviet army is not attempting to rebuild a long-range defensive line at this time, but is concentrating countless reserves in key military areas. Now, the Soviet army is mostly concentrated in cities where roads and railways intersect, while the German army is adopting the method of avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, not immediately attempting to occupy towns, but specializing in attacking areas where the Soviet army's forces are weaker. Now, the German army has already passed Kiev and is proceeding in two directions, north and south of the city. The reason why it has not immediately occupied the city is because of this reason. How this great war will develop should be watched closely afterwards, and one must not be too optimistic. It must be known that the enemy still has a countless amount of manpower, materials, and weapons to use, and they are not being used sparingly.</p>
<p>German Aircraft Attack on Soviet Capital Foiled, Repelled by Anti-Aircraft Gun Teams</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 25th: German aircraft attacked Moscow again last night. The anti-aircraft gun teams on the outskirts of the city fired intense shells, forming a terrifying fire net. The Soviet night fighters also constructed a strong defensive line in the sky around the city. As a result, the German aircraft could not fly into the Soviet capital to bomb it. The air raid alert of last night started and became active, and the residents of Moscow calmly took refuge in air-raid shelters, quietly waiting for the German aircraft to arrive, but no bombs landed. At 10:10 p.m., all the German aircraft were driven away, and the alert was lifted. The residents of the city now regard air raids as normal and are following in the footsteps of the people of London. Many Soviet people now carry beds, chairs, food, and other necessities to the subway stations to spend the night. After 9:00 p.m. every night, the Moscow subway stops running passenger cars to allow citizens to spend the night. Daily life is as usual.</p>
<p>Red Army Troops Stationed in Estonia Take Everything with Them During Retreat</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th: Finnish radio said that according to Estonian sources, in all parts of Estonia occupied by the Red Army, the order issued by Stalin to destroy and take away everything before the retreat is now being implemented. Wherever the Soviet troops retreat, nothing is left behind.</p>
<h3 id="e21">U.S. Government Requests Huge Special Funding from Congress; Totaling Over 8 Billion Gold Dollars for the Use of the Navy, Army, and Shipbuilding <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th – The House Appropriations Committee has proposed to the House of Representatives a new appropriation of $8,063,000,000 for the use of the U.S. Navy, Army, and Maritime Commission. This includes funds to accelerate the shipbuilding program, with the goal of building two merchant ships per day by early next year. This appropriation allocates $4,760,000,000 to the Army, to provide for the equipment and supplies for an army of 1,722,000 men (309,000 more than the current force), and includes emergency provisions for the Army to increase to 3,000,000 men. If the aforementioned appropriation is approved by Congress, the Army's total funding for the fiscal year beginning July 1st will reach $15,328,000,000. The Appropriations Committee advocates for $1,698,000,000 to be used for the construction of 541 cargo ships, and to subsidize the acquisition of another 350 cargo ships to compensate for the shortage of ships due to the Lend-Lease Act. The Maritime Commission has stated to the House Appropriations Committee that 100 U.S. merchant ships have been chartered by the United Kingdom for use in the Red Sea. A total of 2.3 million tons of ships in the North Atlantic have been transferred to the UK. The current U.S. shipbuilding rate is two ships per week, which is expected to increase to one ship per day by January of this year, and to two ships per day by December of next year. When the current program is completed, the U.S. merchant fleet is expected to increase from its current 10 million tons to 16,712,000 tons. The House Appropriations Committee also stated that the funds allocated to the Army will enable 83 air groups (currently 54) to maintain a year of wartime readiness. The Army will add 152,000 personnel to manage the program for training 30,000 pilots, and another 157,000 personnel to fill the ranks of the units established in this fiscal year. $3,409,000,000 of the Army's funds will be allocated to establish large-scale arsenals and supply depots, and to increase the number of tanks and anti-tank guns. The Navy will receive $1,569,000,000 to increase its enlisted strength from 250,000 to 369,000, to expand the fleet's crews, and to increase the Marine Corps from 46,000 to 75,000. The Navy's appropriation includes $300,000,000 for the construction and improvement of island bases, and another $300,000,000 for expanding shipbuilding facilities.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Soviet Military Representative to Britain Issues Statement <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>United Press, London, 25th – The head of the Soviet military delegation to Britain, General Golikov, upon arriving here yesterday, refuted German reports of disorganization in the Soviet military. He stated that the Soviet military has now been completely reorganized. It is also reported that Mr. Golikov stated that the Soviet military command has never had such centralized and unified power as it does today. Moscow sources also report that the Soviet Union is very satisfied with Britain's economic assistance, including the shipment of military supplies to the Soviet Union from British territories such as the dominions. News also indicates that U.S.-Soviet talks are progressing smoothly. However, Moscow has more faith in the President regarding the provision of rapid assistance and the delivery of necessities to the Soviet Union than it does in the U.S. Secretary of State and the Departments of the Army and Navy.</p>

<p>United Press, Moscow, 25th – Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Lozovsky denied last night the reports that the Soviet government intends to move the remains of Lenin, the founder of the Soviet revolution, buried in Red Square. He strongly asserted that the Soviet Union will certainly be able to defend Moscow. Lozovsky stated, "Although Lenin is dead, we still feel that he is not. We feel Lenin is with us everywhere. We are currently defending Moscow and everything we love."</p>

<h3 id="e27">Submarine Warfare Record <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The captain, looking at the compass, said "Sixty feet," while taking off his frozen rain hat and scarf. The naval lieutenant crisply relayed the order, and the soldiers managing the flotation rod swiftly followed the order with the skill they had acquired over years of training, as expertly as a musician paying attention to note changes. The naval lieutenant's focus was akin to an organist's attention to the changes in notes. The submarine then gradually tilted downwards, and finally stopped, having reached a horizontal position. The two helmsmen, both senior and junior, managing the submarine's stern rudder breathed a sigh of relief, without making a sound.</p>
<p>The deputy commander reported, "Sixty feet, sir!"</p>
<p>The captain responded with a "Good," then moved forward, brushed the ice shavings off his gloves, and said, "Let's have a cup of tea! Tops has cherry jam."</p>
<p>The deputy commander responded, "Good idea! I was just thinking about it." He followed the captain into the officers' quarters, saying, "If I decide to travel far, I'm afraid my thoughts will be full."</p>
<p>The commander inspected the sea surface through the periscope. He occasionally rotated the lens in circles, and his feet on the pedal also turned slightly, but his body remained in the same direction.</p>
<p>In the past few minutes, he had ordered the crew to their posts. The torpedo operators lined up behind the torpedo tubes, and the launch officer sat in front of the lever, wiping his nose thoughtfully. They were isolated from the control room, and separated from the silent commander next to the periscope by several small rooms; at this time, they had nothing to do. The curved cap of the torpedo tube suddenly opened, and water rushed in. All that remained was to wait for the opportune moment, when the red light would illuminate, and the launch officer would pull the lever below.</p>
<p>They whispered, guessing what the captain saw. The people in the control room were slightly better off than them, because the captain sometimes spoke, and they could learn a little about what was happening on the sea surface. But the torpedo operators were as blind as bats, and as deaf as David's pigs, without seeing or hearing anything. They themselves admitted this point, and were accustomed to it, regarding it as natural.</p>
<p>The launch officer roared, pulled out a handful of cotton from his pocket, and wiped the lever, like an executioner sharpening his axe before an execution. The two crew members touched each other with their elbows. It turned out that five days before departure, the launch officer's house had been destroyed by a bomb. Although his wife was saved, his only daughter, five years old, was buried in the rubble and died when she was dug out. He only had four days to bury her.</p>
<p>The gunner and the loader stood at the door of the ammunition depot, below the gun port. Like the torpedo operators, they knew nothing about what was happening outside. However, they knew that the pedal might suddenly tilt upwards, and the captain would order them to prepare to open fire. They would then have to open the gun port above, run up to the gun platform as the submarine surfaced, load the shell into the chamber, and bombard the target they saw.</p>
<p>Naval gun battles on the surface often involve a mindset of certain death. If they were pierced by enemy shells, they could not hope to submerge again. Therefore, the first bullet must be aimed accurately to ensure a hit.</p>
<p>The only person who knew the current situation on the sea surface was the commander. He stared at the scene reflected in the periscope, all his nerves immersed in complex calculations. Every now and then, a sliver of green foam swirled and blocked the periscope. After the foam dispersed, he could see his target again. At that time, he had to calculate its direction, speed, and distance from his own submarine; he had to decide on his response strategy, and predict the enemy's attack plan when they discovered his protruding periscope. He occasionally issued orders to change the submarine's direction. He stealthily advanced, seeing six enemy ships, protected by a destroyer on each side, zigzagging from port to starboard. The sun was directly behind the target, and the sunlight shone on the whitecaps, emitting a dazzling light, which made it difficult for him to use the periscope; and it also increased the risk of the enemy lookout discovering the periscope. The escorting destroyers could turn around and rush towards him at any time. He had to decide how close they had to get before opening fire, and he had to decide this alone. Every minute that passed increased the possibility of hitting the enemy ship, and also increased the danger of being discovered and destroyed. When the chances of success and failure were exactly equal, it all depended on his experience and judgment to decide whether to advance or retreat.</p>
<p>The lieutenant stood beside him, looking at him, stroking his newly grown beard, thinking of a politician's words: "The astonishing solitude of high command." But whether on land, at sea, or in the air, no submarine captain ever felt lonely during an attack. Other military leaders have others to assist them, perhaps an adjutant, perhaps an army, but in any case, he has his own feelings, his own judgment, to be remembered in the future. No military leader, no one, will forget this kind of observation. Either restrain the violent impulses, or encourage the wavering courage. But the captain of a submarine is the sole judge and sole juror of his actions, not only at the time, but forever.</p>
<p>Fire!</p>
<p>The launch officer pulled the lever sharply backwards, and the submarine suddenly shook.</p>
<p>"Lower the periscope, fifteen to port!"</p>
<p>Inside the submarine, all that could be heard was the hum of the engines. The captain stood watching the long hand slowly crawl across the clock face, remaining by the compass, steering wheel, and levers, calmly waiting for orders. The driver, with a pencil in hand, lay prone on the map, recording the changes in course. Minutes passed, their hearts beating fast, feeling that a second was too slow. The lieutenant remembered his beard again, his knuckles cracking, and he felt better after his eardrums vibrated.</p>
<p>The submarine vibrated.</p>
<p>The tension immediately eased. Whispers arose, followed by a brief command: "Raise the periscope." The captain crouched and peered into the periscope for a few seconds, then suddenly stood up and issued a string of orders rapidly. The naval lieutenant explained them in detail, the deck tilted steeply downwards, and after a while returned to a horizontal position. The engines had stopped, the entire submarine was silent, the captain kept his eyes on the depth gauge, and said: "We have put the lead ship of the escort convoy in our pocket. But I think one of the destroyers has seen the torpedo trail. It is heading towards us at full speed, prepare for depth charges!"</p>
<p>The submarine shook violently, as if struck by a heavy hammer, throwing the speaker out. Then there was a second, a third shock, even more violent, followed by the sound of breaking glass, and all the lights went out. The light of electric torches quickly swept through the room, revealing the people in the room one by one, still at their posts, some with fierce faces emerging from their fur coats, some with their hands gripping the steering wheel levers tightly. The captain, bent over, was trying to restore his dislocated thumb. The light shone in all directions, searching for cracks.</p>
<p>The lieutenant calmly said, "Install the spare light bulbs!" The torch in his hand repeatedly shone on the captain, asking: "Is your injury serious?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I just sat on my thumb and hurt it. Go check if the submarine is safe. Is the driver there?"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Come here and pull my thumb."</p>
<p>Another depth charge exploded above their heads, and the air inside the submarine seemed to compress and expand again.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Yarn and Fabric: The Cotton Yarn Situation Remains Awkward; Although Cotton Yarn Shipments to Hong Kong Have Not Ceased, People are Quite Anxious, Like a Lost Sheep at a Crossroads <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is once again in an awkward situation, unable to rise or fall. Prices cannot fall because raw materials are difficult to loosen and factory costs are hindered. Prices cannot rise because sales are not smooth, and transactions for 20-count yarn are even more scarce. In this situation, a sense of anxiety arises, like a lost sheep at a crossroads. As for the market situation, the large players' absorbed quantities remain stable and unmoved, and there are no suitable opportunities to exit. Although the general small shorts are very active, the warehouse warrants are becoming increasingly scarce. All kinds of situations have led to a stalemate. However, the daily spread for multiple positions is still posted at 2.5 cents by the longs. From this perspective, the longs are at a disadvantage. Therefore, the fundamental reason has a sense of "not knowing what medicine is being sold in the gourd." In short, it still cannot escape the situation of fluctuations. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was $1,609, and the low price was $1,595. In the afternoon, the initial transaction was $1,602, rising to $1,605, and the final price was $1,604. 850 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Double Horse: Opened, with the sentiment still tight. The opening price was $1,596-7. A certain trader and several others consistently called for buying. After a short while, it rose to $1,601-2. At this time, it was heard that spot sales were not strong and the sentiment was flat. It hovered around $1,601-2 for a long time. Until 11:30, it suddenly rose to $1,609, for unknown reasons. In an instant, it retreated to $1,598. The closing price was $1,601-2. The statistics for intraday transactions totaled 6,550 bales, including 50 bales for Hong Kong comprador and 6,500 bales for fellow traders.</p>
<p>Golden Double Horse Futures Yarn Market Conditions: At the beginning of the agricultural season, due to rising U.S. cotton and gold prices, people expected higher prices. Gold firms and securities firms were still hedging purchases. The August contract rose $3 compared to yesterday, September rose $4, and October rose $1.5. After opening, there were still more new purchases and short covering. The August contract even rose to $1,457, September to $1,526.5, and October to $1,542. Afterwards, as gold prices rose and the market weakened, customer sales stagnated, and the longs began to sell, causing prices to gradually loosen. The afternoon closing saw August up $2, September up $1.5, and October up $0.5. 5,390 bales were traded. The after-market opening was weak in the near term and firm in the long term. After entering the market, due to scarce transactions, fluctuations were quite narrow, only rising or falling by $2-3. By the late closing, the August contract was up $4 from the previous day, and the September and October contracts were each up $4.5. The total day's trading volume was 6,890 bales, a decrease of 2,860 bales compared to the previous day. The day's opening, high, and low prices are recorded on the left (net trading prices).</p>
<h3 id="e29">Speculative Cotton Merchants' Ball-Kicking Enthusiasm High, Only Manufacturers Cautious in Ordering Cotton, Over 20,000 Bales of New Brazilian Cotton Arriving <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation remains strong. Coupled with the rebound in American cotton prices, anxieties are heightened. However, due to sluggish yarn sales and limited capacity, manufacturers are hesitant. Nevertheless, the general speculative sentiment towards the market is enthusiastic due to concerns about supply disruptions, leading to lively "ball-kicking" (speculative) trading. Prices are also gradually rising. The opening prices for spot cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Additionally, the Shanghai foreign cotton market is quiet but firm. Trading in lower-grade Indian cotton has been particularly good due to the recent disruption of Fire Machine cotton supplies. Simultaneously, Rangoon cotton prices have also exceeded 250 yuan. As for direct forward purchases of American cotton by foreign merchants and manufacturers, the uncertain situation in the Far East has reduced their desire to buy, and they are currently unwilling to make large-scale orders. In total, only 300 bales of Indian cotton and over 700 bales of Brazilian cotton were ordered yesterday. There were no transactions in American cotton.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the American President Lines' "Pan Gulf" steamer, which departed from New York at the end of last month, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. The ship is carrying a total of 20,996 bales of Brazilian cotton, mostly owned by Chinese cotton mills and trading houses. It is currently berthed at floating docks 32 and 33 in the Huangpu River. After unloading the pine planks from the cargo hold, it is scheduled to berth at the Baiyunjing Dalai Wharf on the 27th for unloading.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market initially fell due to selling by speculators, but subsequently rebounded due to active buying by industry participants and short covering. As a result, closing prices were up 25 to 30 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially fell due to selling by speculators, then rebounded due to short covering and cotton merchants' hedging purchases. Finally, the market fell again due to negative news from the US government and selling by speculators. Yesterday's closing prices fell by 1 to 6 rupees.</p>
<p>The opening market situation today is predicted to rise by 2 rupees.</p>
<p>Securities: Regardless of How the Times and Future Unfold, Just Watch Foreign Debts Keep Jumping. The Domestic Debt Market Remains Relatively Stable</p>
<p>London, 24th (Thursday) Telegram: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debts and Far Eastern British companies' stocks show that Chinese foreign debts have regained momentum. The previous Anglo-German Consortium Loan (British issue) surged 4 pounds to 47 pounds. The Crisp Loan rose 2.5 pounds to 29.5 pounds. The Anglo-French Loan (British issue) and the Reorganization Loan (British issue) each rose 2 pounds, with the Anglo-French at 45 pounds and the Reorganization at 38 pounds. The Vickers Aircraft Loan rose half a pound to 9 pounds. Among the later-stage railway bonds, the Longhai Loan alone rose 2.5 pounds to 12.5 pounds. Beining, Hukuang, and Guangdong-Kowloon each rose 1 pound, with Beining at 55 pounds, Hukuang (non-German issue) at 15 pounds (German issue at 13 pounds), and Guangdong-Kowloon at 10 pounds. The Shanghai-Nanjing rose half a pound to 15 pounds. British stocks showed a slight recovery. The Mercantile Bank shares fell 1 shilling and 6 pence to 9 pounds. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's London-registered shares fell 1.5 pounds to 79 pounds. There were no other changes.</p>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds slightly rebounded after the sharp drop yesterday. Selling pressure eased, and buyers seized the opportunity to push prices up. Class C bonds approached 70 yuan. Although rumors persisted in the market, sentiment remained relatively stable because interest payments were only a few days away. Yesterday morning, Dahua, Renfeng, Runde, Tongkang, Dechang, Dafeng, and Lianyi, among others, actively bought, either covering short positions, adding to long positions, or investing. The market was quite lively. However, Dahua, Xie Xingyuan, Xinfu, and Xinhua, among others, continued to sell. Shen Dachang, Ji Hu Heji, and Hu Heji also sold. The market briefly recovered in the morning but did not break the low price before rebounding strongly, slightly higher than the previous day. In the afternoon, Lianhe, Hengkang, Jiji, Gongmao, and Tongkang, among others, bought. Xinfu, Xinhua, Xie Xingyuan, Dafeng, Yi Zhong, and Renchang continued to sell. After buyers pushed up prices, all varieties recovered, except for Class Ding, which did not open. The other varieties all recovered by 3 to 9 jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately 2 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Qin Yarn Mill were traded at 140 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The opening of the Zhongye stock market was stable. Buyers immediately stepped in to support prices whenever there was a dip. The market softened again by closing. Xiangtai shares remained strong, opening at 79 yuan, rising to 82 yuan, and then falling back 2 yuan at closing. Ken Zhi shares also reached a high of 34 yuan, closing at 33.25 yuan. Rubber shares were quietly firm, with general prices higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Finance: Only Japanese Merchants Selling US Dollars</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The listed exchange rates of various currencies remained unchanged. In the over-the-counter market, the British pound was flat. The US dollar initially tightened but also returned to flat after the Bank of Taiwan and Yokohama Specie Bank suddenly sold US dollars amounting to about 500,000 yuan, causing speculative activities to cease immediately. The dollar weakened to 5.3125 and hardened to 5.375. Major British and American banks absorbed a large amount, making it difficult for the dollar to ease. The market remained stagnant in the afternoon. The closing prices of both currencies were the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>Speculative Tracking and Selling</p>
<p>Since the morning, foreign news indicated that the British and Indian silver markets were up, and the US dollar was flat. The exchange rates of various countries showed that the US dollar appreciated by 0.25 against the British pound and depreciated by 0.03 against the Shanghai dollar. The British pound appreciated by 0.03125 against the French franc. The listed exchange rates of various currencies by the Central Bank remained unchanged. At the opening of the domestic market, banks' selling prices were 3s 2 3/4375 for spot British pounds and 5.34375 yuan for US dollars. Speculators immediately bought in, causing the US dollar to weaken to 5.3125 yuan. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's listed exchange rates were all flat. The silver balancing tax increased by 0.25, totaling 24.50%. The market situation stabilized temporarily. At 9:45, the Bank of Taiwan and Yokohama Specie Bank sold US dollars for August delivery at 5.34375 to Jili, Datong, and Citibank, triggering some speculators to sell. However, the price had hardened to the point where it could be settled at the above price. Near noon, Yokohama Specie Bank successively sold US dollars for August delivery at 5.375 to HSBC, American Express, and Banque Belge pour l'Étranger. Soon after, HSBC re-sold to Huaxing for August delivery at 5.375, which was the lowest price. The afternoon closing price for US dollars for forward settlement remained at 5.34375 yuan, and the British pound remained at 3s 2 3/4375.</p>
<p>The Market Situation Remained Stagnant in the Afternoon</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Japanese banks stopped selling, while speculators and certain banks slightly sold US dollars for August delivery at 5.375. The dollars were absorbed by Datong and Mercantile Bank. The market situation became stagnant and flat. At the 3:30 closing, the spot and August delivery prices were 3s 2 3/4375 for British pounds (some were still at 3s 2 5) and 5.34375 yuan for US dollars, the same as the previous day's closing prices.</p>
<p>The Gold Market Turns Firm; Cash Continues to Rise</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday was quite uncertain, but the situation turned firm. The Japanese occupation of Vietnam led many to believe that Britain and the United States would not necessarily respond with military force, causing sentiment to waver. Amidst short covering, the market opened high and continued to rise to 6,530 yuan. However, pressure from Shanghai Westside financiers (rumored to have taken short positions) and the dumping of US dollars by Japanese banks (it was difficult to sell at 5.375 yuan at noon) caused gold trading houses and securities firms to sell, leading to a sharp decline to the 6,500 yuan mark. Unexpectedly, bill brokers re-entered the market, causing prices to rebound. The fluctuations were narrower in the afternoon, with a range of 14 yuan. Ultimately, prices rose by 9 yuan, closing flat. The daily trading volume was 60,000 to 70,000 taels. The spread (July to August) was that sellers offered 45 yuan to buyers. Cash prices continued to rise. Xianghe offered 200 taels at 7,140 yuan. Yutai Feng offered 20 taels at 7,150 yuan, which Junxinyuan bought. In the afternoon, Yutai Feng again offered 10 taels to the jewelry industry, with the price rising to 7,170 yuan, an increase of another 40 yuan. Gold ornaments were also priced up by 5 yuan, totaling 740 yuan.</p>
<p>Both Spot and Forward US Dollar Drafts Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: The spot market price was relatively stable, so the prices of British pounds and US dollars were also stable. British pound drafts were stagnant as usual, and the market price remained flat. US dollar drafts for forward delivery opened at 1,870 yuan. After the opening, Dinghe sold, and the price retreated to 69 yuan. Then, suddenly, Yili Ji, Xietai Yong, Zhicheng, and Dongsheng Heng bought, pushing the price up to 74 yuan. Zhengda Xiang, Xingyong, and Yintai sold, and the market closed at 68 yuan at noon. The afternoon closing was 1,871 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan compared to the previous day. Spot prices were 18 yuan and 4 jiao 7 fen. Hong Kong drafts showed a slightly weaker trend. Japanese gold drafts once reached a high of 2.09 yuan, closing at 2.07 yuan in the evening, up 1 fen compared to the previous day. Korean drafts also showed a slight upward trend, rising to 1 yuan, 7 jiao, and 0.5 li in the evening market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong National Currency Exchange Rate Increases</p>
<p>Discount of Over 1,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Two types of currency circulate in Hong Kong: Hong Kong dollars and national currency. The daily exchange rate of Hong Kong paper money for Shanghai is telegraphed to Shanghai. In the past, Hong Kong used the national currency to remit to Shanghai, and the handling fee was only about 10 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Last month, the discount for Hong Kong national currency remitting to Shanghai was over 900 yuan per 10,000 yuan. Recently, the discount has become even larger, reaching 1,520 yuan per 10,000 yuan. That is, exchanging 11,520 yuan in national currency in Hong Kong yields 10,000 yuan in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yonglong Money Exchange Joins the Clearing House</p>
<p>The newly established Yonglong Money Exchange in this city officially opened today and joined the Money Exchange House as a member. Yesterday, the Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee, after receiving notification from the Money Industry Reserve, also sent a circular to all clearing banks to inform them.</p>
<p>Grain: Rice Rises Quickly, Also Falls Quickly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice fell rapidly because it had risen too quickly the previous day. The price increase was entirely driven by speculative "ball-kicking." In reality, local customers lacked genuine demand. The instigators who used the false Vietnam issue as a stimulus also had no actual impact. Because there was a sign of obstructing tribute rice, new long positions were unwilling to get involved, and those who had followed the trend to buy had no choice but to sell in the market. When selling pressure intensified in the market, prices immediately fell sharply. Yinghua Company once dropped by 3 to 4 yuan, and spot rice fell by 2 to 3 yuan, all of which had fallen below the previous day's increase. Then, because of practical consumption from local streets, etc., taking advantage of the small declines to slightly advance, and some floating long positions were also dragging in, the market recovered about a yuan at closing. Yinghua Company opened for 1,600 to 1,700 tons. Saigon No. 1 traded from 143.5 yuan to 142 yuan; Siamese No. 2 traded from 140 yuan to 139 yuan for spot and 138.5 yuan to 137.5 yuan for forward delivery; and small white rice traded from 146 yuan to 145.5 yuan for spot and 145 yuan to 144 yuan for forward delivery. Spot rice transactions also increased to 14,000 bags. Small white rice traded from 117.5 yuan to 114.5 yuan.</p>
<p>For Thick, Polished Rice, after prices were expensive in the previous market, yesterday, due to origin [issue], cargo owners were unwilling [to sell], and this [company’s] prices were also [not good], so the selling prices remained, with no increase or decrease. Opened for Hainan fresh early [rice] at 141 yuan, then to 138 yuan, and special grade at 145 yuan. Wuxi original package lodging regular rice at 132 yuan, and 130 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice is scarce and sales are slow, still desolate, with little change in market prices. Hong Kong white is still priced high from 122 to 3 yuan, then to 17 yuan, glutinous green rice at 112 to 3 yuan to 110 yuan, domestic glutinous rice at 121 to 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Flag Brand Flour Arrives: Over 400,000 Bags</p>
<p>A large quantity of flour was shipped from Seattle on the American S.S. Don Jose, totaling 291,200 bags. It arrived in port at noon yesterday, docking at Qichang Wharf in Pudong to unload. In addition, the American ship S.S. Pan Gulf, in addition to carrying a large quantity of cotton, also had 2,793 tons of flour, totaling over 128,000 bags. It entered the port yesterday morning and is temporarily berthed at floating docks 32 and 33 for unloading and transferring cargo. Therefore, the two American ships brought a total of over 410,000 bags of foreign flour. (Zu)</p>
<p>The current situation of the foreign flour market is slightly mixed. Since the news of the southward advance spread, speculative hoarders have been active again. However, the source of foreign flour is not expected to be interrupted. Yesterday, Golden Dragon flour was priced at 32 yuan to 31.9 jiao, Battery flour at 33 yuan to 33.1 jiao, Bell Tower brand (weighed by the bank) at 33 yuan, and Double Eagle brand at 31.8 jiao, with the selling prices fluctuating by 2 to 3 jiao.</p>
<p>The new wheat arrivals are all being sent to Japanese factories, with the purchase price remaining at 41 yuan. The purchase price for Chinese factories is 47 yuan, but there is no substantial spot supply available for purchase.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes: Raw Oil Rises by 3 to 4 Yuan; Soybeans Are Being Hoarded and Become Expensive</p>
<p>Edible oil: Initially weak, then firm. Upon investigation, cottonseed oil initially fell due to profit-taking, but then rose due to aggressive buying by major players, resulting in an increase of several jiao to over a yuan compared to before. Raw oil rose by another 3 to 4 yuan due to cargo owners' selling pressure. Soybean oil was firm and stable. [Company’s] oil was at four thousand [amount] []. [Place name] raw oil was at one hundred and fifty items, Qingdao raw oil was at thirty [amount], large [] soybean oil at twenty barrels, [] soybean oil at fifty items, (price details in the market price []).</p>
<p>Soybeans: Arrivals have been scarce recently, and cargo owners are mostly [] hoarding for speculation. Yesterday's market had few transactions, and prices were raised by about half a yuan. A unified market transaction of 200 bags of Tianjin Gold Yuan beans was at 48.5 yuan. 700 bags of German soybeans were at 45 yuan to 44.5 yuan, all handled by this neighborhood.</p>
<p>Exports: Today (26th) there are 375 bags of soybeans, 5,340 pieces of soybean cakes, 290 items of soybean oil, 280 bags of sesame seeds, and 400 cans of sesame oil, all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Hong Kong and Southeast Asian Merchants Urgently Shipping Piece Goods; 1,100 Items Shipped Today</p>
<p>The cloth market yesterday was stable, but actual sales still lacked development. Most speculative buyers also took a wait-and-see attitude. Hong Kong and Southeast Asian merchants were urgently shipping goods, but the intention to import new goods was very weak, reportedly due to the scarcity of ships and increased freight costs. The selling prices of various cloths were consistently stable. Only a few out-of-stock goods and forward contracts increased in price by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. The transaction volume of spot and forward contracts in this neighborhood was over 500 pieces, with Cantonese, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asian merchants handling several hundred pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, and printed cloth, and northern merchants from Tianjin handling 70 to 80 pieces of twill flannel, French flannel, and coarse cloth. Today, 1,140 pieces of piece goods are being shipped to Hong Kong and 200 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<p>Dong Cloth initially rose in the morning and then retreated at noon, resulting in a slight increase overall. White cotton cloth (Longtou brand, fine cloth factory, single shift) closed at 49.625 yuan, up 2 jiao. Colored tribute (four gentlemen, serge) was at 1.61875 yuan, with no gains or losses.</p>
<p>Dried and Fresh Goods: Dried Lily Bulbs Present New Items; Arriving Today</p>
<p>The first batch of new dried lily bulbs has already been loaded and is en route. It was reported yesterday that it had already been shipped from Suzhou to Shanghai and is expected to arrive today. The price of the large batches is expected to be slightly higher than the old goods. Since sales have not been active recently, the price cannot be too high either.</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Free China Climate is Flourishing; Laying the Foundation for a New Economy; Striving for Self-Sufficiency in National Defense Industrial Products; The Rural Reconstruction Plan is Gradually Being Realized <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Millard's Review, to be published today, contains a special article discussing the new economic developments in West China. It states that the ancient Chinese proverb, "Heaven never seals off all exits," is proven true by the fact that China is rebuilding its economic foundation in the interior. With the emerging industries of the coastal provinces largely destroyed, China has begun to engage in economic recovery and construction in the safe and fertile hinterland.</p>
<p>Economic Mobilization Plan Established Early</p>
<p>After the war, the Chinese government formulated a plan for economic mobilization. In terms of industry, it strived to achieve self-sufficiency in industrial products needed for the war in the shortest possible time. It also supported factories producing military supplies and daily necessities and controlled the sales of their products. At the same time, it assisted the relocation of coastal factories to the interior, initiated the establishment of new factories, and provided them with economic and technical assistance. In addition, it used military and police protection to prevent strike waves in these factories.</p>
<p>Establishing Important Industrial and Mining Organizations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs' main tasks were fourfold: (1) increasing military manufacturing, (2) increasing exports, increasing the manufacturing of daily necessities, and (4) developing major industries and mining. Since the ministry was established in 1938, it has strived to promote the implementation of these tasks. It used government funds to establish major industrial and mining organizations, subsidize private factories to relocate from war zones, and encourage people in the rear to invest in production enterprises. In the past four years, there have been three major differences in China's economic situation compared to before the war.</p>
<p>National Defense Industry Develops Satisfactorily</p>
<p>First, before the war, China's economic enterprises were concentrated in a few coastal provinces. Now, the economic center has moved to the southwest and northwest, which have security guarantees and can develop peacefully. Second, before the war, China had very few heavy industries for national defense. Although the Chinese government carefully planned and encouraged them in many ways, it was difficult for China's heavy industry to actively produce. Today, China's national defense industry, including copper, iron, lightning, machinery, chemical, and smelting factories, etc., under government or private management, has developed satisfactorily. Although it has not yet reached the point of self-sufficiency, it has laid a solid foundation for the vigorous development of the national defense industry in the future.</p>
<p>Rural Economy Lays the Foundation</p>
<p>Third, before the summer of 1937, the situation in China's rural areas was backward, especially in the southwestern and northwestern provinces. Today, the economic development of these provinces has made astonishing progress. This favorable change in the rural situation must be attributed to the stability of rural finance, the implementation of irrigation methods, the promotion of rural cooperatives, and the improvement of rural technology and agricultural exports. Before the war, the government launched a five-year plan that focused specifically on the heavy industry in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. The war forced the government to build an economic fortress in West China.</p>
<p>Three-Year Self-Sufficiency Plan</p>
<p>Recently, the three-year plan for industrial and mining development has begun. Its purpose is to expand the strength of the results already obtained so that the efficiency of self-sufficiency increases with the prolongation of the war. In the early stages of the war, the number of factories relocating from coastal or Yangtze River cities was as high as 450, of which 168 were machinery factories. The products of these factories include military equipment, generators, industrial equipment, machinery manufacturing, and transportation equipment. The Ministry of Economic Affairs' specially established Industrial and Mining Adjustment Committee is engaged in assisting private production industries. The difficulties encountered by a large number of factories relocating from Shanghai, Hankou, and Yichang have been largely overcome by the cooperation of labor and management in these factories and the determined spirit of the authorities of the Adjustment Committee. Because most of the ships were requisitioned for military use during the war, the machines and equipment for these relocations had to be transported westward along the Yangtze River by small boats to reach the interior.</p>
<p>Government Subsidizes Relocated Factories</p>
<p>During the factory relocation period, the government paid special attention to machinery factories and electro-chemical factories because these factories could directly assist the work of munitions factories. Factories that help people's livelihoods, such as cotton spinning and flour milling, were given attention first. In addition to providing large loans at low-interest rates to these relocated factories, the government also imported large quantities of materials and equipment from abroad and provided technical personnel to facilitate their rapid resumption of work at designated locations in the interior. In addition, during the four years of the war, the authorities took into consideration the difficulties of the people, reduced commercial taxes, reduced freight rates on national roads, implemented subsidy allowances, granted patents to industrial inventions and improvements, provided loans to small industries and handicrafts, and encouraged Chinese and foreign talents to invest in government-run companies.</p>
<p>Saving Savings to Develop Industry</p>
<p>Recently, the government decided to use all the proceeds from the sale of savings bonds to develop industry, amounting to one million yuan. Last year, the total output value of major industrial and mining plants under government management was 469,370,000 yuan. However, the production volume of small factories distributed throughout Free China is not included. Among them, textiles rank first, reaching 176,300,000 yuan; the chemical industry ranks second, accounting for 143,800,000 yuan; the gold industry ranks third; and then electricity and mining, etc.</p>
<p>Strict Management of Various Industrial and Mining Plants</p>
<p>All industrial and mining plants run by the government are managed by the National Resources Commission. To date, the committee has established 70 "units" in the interior, including 19 for industry, 22 for mining, and 20 for electrical engineering, giving priority to machinery, chemicals, electrical engineering, and welding. Among the mining areas, those related to national defense, such as coal, iron, oil, copper, and tungsten, tin, antimony, and mercury, which are exchanged with foreign countries, are given priority. Hydropower has also been applied where possible. It is estimated that the potential power of the rivers in Sichuan Province alone reaches 29 million kilowatts. In order to increase gold production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established a special Gold Mining Committee.</p>
<p>Establishing Industrial Base in West China</p>
<p>By the end of last year, there were 450 factories, with machines weighing 116,375 tons. In addition, 12,000 technical workers were subsidized by the government to travel to the interior. Another 30,000 workers were assisted by other agencies to go to the interior. In the past four years, 15 new industrial bases have been established in West China. According to a report at the end of last year, there were 1,354 factories in these bases with capital of more than 10,000 and employing more than 30 workers and using electricity, including 312 machinery factories, 93 mining and metallurgy factories, 47 electrical factories, 361 chemical factories, 382 textile factories, and 259 other factories.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Gas Surcharge to Be Reduced Next Month; All Sectors Oppressed by Soaring Living Costs Express Great Relief After Gas Fee Reduction <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that regarding the Shanghai British Gas Company's reduction of the surcharge, neither the company nor the Public Concession's工部局 and the French Concession's公董局 have made a formal announcement. However, yesterday (24th), reliable sources revealed that from August 1st, the gas surcharge will be reduced from 250% to 160%.</p>
<p>Shanghai Citizens Are Very Relieved</p>
<p>Shanghai citizens have been enduring the hardships of soaring living expenses, including surcharges, for several years. The news of the gas surcharge reduction is the first welcome message they have heard in a while. The exact reason for the gas surcharge reduction is not yet known, but as long as the gas users hear about the reduction, they may not be overly concerned about the reason for the reduction.</p>
<p>Official Announcement Expected in the Coming Days</p>
<p>It is heard that the official announcement of the reduction of the gas surcharge will be made in the coming days. Currently, the surcharge is 250%, which will be reduced to 160%. However, calculating based on the gas fund price, the total amount paid by gas users will be reduced by an average of 25.71%. The gas company had to notify users a month in advance when raising the surcharge, but the fee reduction will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>Power Company Has Made No Statement</p>
<p>The English-language Great Shanghai Evening Post reported that after hearing that the British Shanghai Gas Company proposed reducing the surcharge, it is still awaiting formal approval from the 工部局 this morning (25th). Once news is received from the authorities, an official announcement will be made. The reporter asked a key member of the Shanghai Power Company whether the company would also consider reducing the surcharge. According to him, the price of coal is soaring, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain coal-carrying ships. Therefore, he did not see any possibility of reducing the fee. Coal usually costs about 10 yuan per ton, but it has now risen to 300 yuan. 86% of the company's revenue is spent on purchasing coal.</p>
<p>Selling Coal Balls at Discounted Prices Meets with Opposition</p>
<p>The market price of coal balls has trended downwards due to competition from peers, but compared to their costs, there are still substantial profits to be made, so the threat to citizens' lives cannot be lightly reduced. The Machine-Made Coal Ball Association sold coal balls at discounted prices last year (a total of eight phases, ten days each, selling 1,700 loads per day). Later, it ended because market prices returned to normal. Now, given that prices are even higher than before and coal ball prices are twice as high as they were then, citizens' livelihoods are even more difficult. Therefore, it is proposed to continue promoting sales at discounted prices to reduce the burden on citizens and to stabilize market prices. However, it has been opposed by several large coal ball factories, making it difficult to fulfill the wish. These coal ball factories have also set up separate organizations, the motive of which is to oppose the continued discounted sales and restrict price increases. It is hoped that the authorities will impose legal sanctions.</p>

<p>The English-language Great Shanghai Evening Post reported that Li Quesen, executive officer of the American Aid Agency in China, left Shanghai yesterday (24th), accompanying the ship via Hong Kong to Manila. He will take a clipper plane to the United States there and is expected to return to Shanghai in five to six weeks. The reason for Li's sudden departure from Shanghai is unknown, but it is only heard that the trip is related to the American Aid Agency. During his absence, his duties will be performed by Deputy Executive Officer Tittellburg.</p>
<h3 id="e33">30 Million Tons of Coal Traded; Another 200,000 Tons Are Being Negotiated <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of precaution, major coal companies in the city have previously tried to prepare for sending telegrams to India, Annam, and other places to order large quantities of smoked white coal, so as to transport them to Shanghai in order to adjust [supply]. According to the news revealed by various coal industry associations, the amount of coal traded so far is approximately 300,000 tons. There is another 200,000 tons, which is just in contact back and forth, but the production price of the coal that has been traded is heard to be only about 50 to 60 yuan. Once it is transported to Shanghai, including the cost of shipping, the cost per ton may not be more than about 300 yuan. The above are all high-quality goods, but the production price of second-class goods is even more []. For coal-carrying ships, coal merchants have now rented them separately. The coal that has been traded can be transported to Shanghai soon, which will greatly benefit the entire coal market.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Two Foreign Vessels Arrive: 400,000 Bags of Flour; Pacific Cargo Ships Have Increased <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-American Pacific shipping route currently relies entirely on American vessels. Japanese vessels have been greatly affected since the U.S. government implemented controls on import and export goods. American mail ships have also been requisitioned by the Shipping Committee. However, the number of cargo ships has increased. Yesterday, two American cargo ships arrived in Shanghai one after another, carrying large quantities of cotton and flour. The S.S. Pan Gulf carried 20,996 bales of cotton and 1,793 tons of flour (approximately 128,000 bags) from the United States, as well as 1,317 tons of lumber. After arriving in port yesterday morning, it berthed at buoys 32 and 33. After the flour and lumber are unloaded, it will move to the Dalae Wharf in Bailianjing to unload the cotton. Another American vessel, the S.S. Don Jose, arrived yesterday afternoon, also carrying 291,200 bags of flour from the United States. It docked at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to unload. Both of these American vessels are managed by Wah Luen Yoko.</p>

<p>According to the North-China Daily News, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Committee has suggested to the Council that it should impose a business tax, following the approach implemented by the French Concession. According to news from yesterday (24th), the Shanghai Municipal Council and its relevant subcommittees will not take action on this matter until it has been thoroughly studied. The Shanghai Municipal Council regular meeting adjourned on July 24th for the summer recess, and will resume on September 2nd. Therefore, the issue of levying business tax has been temporarily shelved. The Council held its last regular meeting before the summer recess on Wednesday, and the Council's General Manager and Director-General, Mr. Fessenden, departed for Japan several days ago for his summer vacation.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Hoarding Large Quantities of Grain: Punishable by Death Under Military Law; Hoarding 5,000 Shi of Grain or 3,000 Shi of Wheat May Result in the Death Penalty or Life Imprisonment <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Regulations prohibiting hoarding and speculation have long been promulgated. It is now learned that the National Government has also issued a "Provisional Statute for Punishing Violations of Food Administration During Extraordinary Times." Key points are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Restrictions on Grain Storage</p>
<p>A. Cases considered hoarding and speculation: (1) Non-commercial individuals or merchants who are not engaged in the grain business purchase and hoard grain and do not sell it in accordance with the regulations of the grain authorities; (2) Grain households or farmers who hide surplus grain that has been designated for sale by the grain authorities. The aforementioned surplus grain refers to all stored grain, minus the amount of grain to be paid as public grain, seeds to be stored, and grain retained for self-consumption until the next harvest.</p>
<p>Grading of Penalties</p>
<p>B. Those who hoard and speculate will be punished according to the following items: (1) 5,000 *shi* or more of grain, or 3,000 *shi* or more of wheat, shall be punishable by death or life imprisonment; (2) 3,000 *shi* or more, but less than 5,000 *shi* of grain, or 1,800 *shi* or more, but less than 3,000 *shi* of wheat, shall be punishable by life imprisonment or imprisonment for not less than ten years; (3) 1,000 *shi* or more, but less than 3,000 *shi* of grain, or 600 *shi* or more, but less than 1,800 *shi* of wheat, shall be punishable by imprisonment for not less than three years and not more than ten years; (4) 500 *shi* or more, but less than 1,000 *shi* of grain, or 300 *shi* or more, but less than 600 *shi* of wheat, shall be punishable by imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than three years; (5) 200 *shi* or more, but less than 500 *shi* of grain, or 100 *shi* or more, but less than 300 *shi* of wheat, shall be punishable by imprisonment for not less than six months and not more than one year; (6) 50 *shi* or more, but less than 200 *shi* of grain, or 30 *shi* or more, but less than 100 *shi* of wheat, shall be punished by detention or a fine of not more than one thousand yuan. In cases punished according to the preceding items, all of the grain shall also be confiscated. (Two *shi* of unhusked rice equals one *shi* of rice; one *shi* of wheat equals 100 *jin* of flour.

<h3 id="e37">Difficulty in Eliminating Small Worms in Tap Water; Shanghai Municipal Council Declares No Major Health Concerns <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Since the summer of this year, reddish, two-headed small worms have been found in tap water in various places. Their numbers are quite rampant, causing surprise and panic among general users. Many believe that drinking this kind of tap water is detrimental to overall hygiene, and have appealed to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department to eliminate them. In order to inform all sectors about the origin of these small worms and their relationship to human health, the Shanghai Municipal Council issued the following statement yesterday: More small worms have been found in tap water this summer than in previous years. They are the larvae of a type of midge. These midges easily multiply. Because they appear like mosquitoes on the surface, they attract attention. Their eggs are tiny and are laid on the surface of the water. Within a certain period of time, they form larvae that are reddish in color. Their presence in tap water is not a major health concern. It is a difficult problem to completely eliminate them in the summer. Other than thoroughly flushing the main water pipes, it is difficult to find any effective measures. The Shanghai Waterworks Company has already begun flushing the main water pipes. This problem is not new. Waterworks companies in other parts of the world have also encountered the same difficulties in finding a complete remedy.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the fourteenth day of fundraising for the Shen Bao Readers' Student Aid Fund. Two facts are encouraging: First, donations reached over three thousand yuan, setting a new record. Second, over four hundred impoverished students came to the office to collect application forms, crowding shoulder to shoulder, creating a scene like a bustling marketplace. The members of the Student Aid Fund Committee also graciously came to hold their first meeting and provide guidance on the direction of the program. Their enthusiasm is deeply appreciated. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Committee Meeting Determines Direction</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:30, the first committee meeting was held in this office. Chen Qingshi, Shen Siliang, Nie Yu, Lu Gaoyi, and Zhao Zongyu were present. First, a representative of this newspaper reported on the motivation and preparation process for the Readers' Student Aid Fund. Next, the proposals were discussed, excerpted as follows: (1) To determine the amount of aid for the Ni, Bao, and Wu children from the three disasters. It was resolved that each of the three students would receive 500 yuan per year until they graduate from junior high school, allocating a total of 4,500 yuan from the total amount of the student aid fund, with the remaining amount used for general aid. However, if the academic performance and conduct of the three students are not satisfactory in the future, the aid may be terminated and another person selected to replace them. (2) To stipulate the standards for the distribution of student aid funds. It was resolved that the primary school group would account for 50% of the total amount, the middle school group would account for 35% of the total amount, and the university and vocational school group would account for 15% of the total amount (however, there is no limit to the number of students aided, and the funds raised will be distributed as much as possible). (3) If outside parties wish to raise funds for student aid in any name, how should this be expressed? It was resolved that if outside parties have fundraising plans and voluntarily contribute, they are welcome, but please do not borrow the name of this newspaper's student aid fund to show caution. (Remaining text omitted).</p>
<p>Donations from All Sectors Are Becoming More Enthusiastic</p>
<p>Dr. Ding Huikang raised a total of 2,064 yuan from colleagues and residents of the Hongqiao Sanatorium, including 800 yuan from Elder Ding Fubao, 200 yuan from Ding Huikang, 200 yuan from Xu Jianying, 200 yuan from Zhu Mintang, 100 yuan from Mrs. Wang, 100 yuan from Mrs. Jin, 100 yuan from Yao Ming, 50 yuan from Mrs. Zhang, 50 yuan from an anonymous person, 35 yuan from an anonymous person, 20 yuan from Xiao Huiying, 20 yuan from Jiang Puxian, 10 yuan each from Liu Deqi, Yu Lingmo, Guo Xiuhuang, Le Anjian, Shen Zhiming, Zheng Lingzhu, Mrs. Ding, Jiang Fangzhong, Zhu Lili, Zhu Zhongwei, Shen Cheng, and Hu Kaifu, 11 yuan from the Shanghai Instrument Company, 5 yuan each from Huang Zhong, Jiang Yuying, Zai Puhui, an anonymous person, Xu Zhongcun, Sang Meiyuan, Yang Chushan, Wang Jie, and Mrs. Cheng, 2 yuan each from Mr. Zhuang, Yu Jing, A Qu, Wu Rongqing, and Chen Xuezhi, and 1 yuan each from Tong Huifen, Hu Meide, and Wang Huilian.

The total is 12,908 yuan and 62 cents.</p>
<p>Following in the Footsteps of Pioneers During National Crises</p>
<p>Ding Huikang, the director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium, wrote: "To the esteemed editor, I am deeply impressed by your newspaper's launch of the Student Aid Fund. I recall that when I was studying at National Tongji University, the students with the best grades in each exam were eligible for free tuition. I, Huikang, with my limited talents, unexpectedly won this honorary scholarship for eight consecutive semesters. Although my family was not wealthy, we were able to live comfortably. I initially did not need the scholarship. I felt ashamed and immediately used a portion of the funds to purchase German encyclopedias and outlines of world history, which I donated to the school library. The remainder was used as my annual allowance, and I no longer needed to ask my family for money. Time flies, and when I look back on the past, more than twenty years have passed. Now, your newspaper has launched a Student Aid Fund specifically to benefit impoverished students. The depth of your intention is truly a step further. Today, science is becoming increasingly prosperous, and new medical science in various countries is showing vigorous signs. Our country, however, is lagging behind in everything and is still in its nascent stages. I am grateful for the cultivation of my alma mater. In this time of national crisis, I dare not exhaust my mediocre efforts and follow in the footsteps of my predecessors, in the hope that I can achieve a little success. I respectfully submit my humble sentiments as a means of self-encouragement. Sincerely, Ding Huikang."</p>
<p>Loving Kindness and Benevolence to Relieve the World</p>
<p>Ms. Xu Houwen wrote: "In recent years, the situation has changed a lot, and life has become more difficult. The number of impoverished children who have dropped out of school is increasing every day. Fortunately, your newspaper is promoting student aid, and those who benefit from it will not be few. Houwen has been listening to family teachings since childhood and knows a little about the greater principles. I have always wanted to do my best to contribute a little, but my family is not wealthy, and the years have passed without fulfilling my wishes. Recently, Jingxian's uncle offered me 500 yuan in legal tender, bestowed by my maternal grandfather, Duke Lu Houshan. I thought that I should not refuse what was given by my elder, and I always thought of my maternal grandfather's generosity and kindness in relieving the world. Thus, I dare to follow this meaning, and in addition to keeping 100 yuan for remembrance, I will donate the remaining 400 yuan to your newspaper's student aid fund to fulfill my long-cherished wish." In addition, Mr. Jin Zhixuan, a boiler inspection engineer from the Special District, donated the 10 yuan transportation fee he received from Jiaotong University after giving a lecture there to the student aid fund. Luo Hongtao from the China Industrial Bank also donated 5 yuan for his son Xinzhang's first calligraphy set to the student aid fund. Their enthusiasm is truly commendable.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, two street fights occurred in the Huishan area of eastern Shanghai on the evening of the 23rd and the afternoon of the 24th between White Russians and German Jewish refugees. Approximately fifty people were injured and are currently recovering. Public Concession police arrested approximately twenty people who participated in the fighting on Wednesday night. Three White Russians were fined 60 yuan, and the rest were released from the Huishan Police Station after paying 10 yuan each.</p>
<p>Nazi Slogans on Sidewalks</p>
<p>It is said that the fighting began on Wednesday night when someone used chalk to draw Nazi swastikas on the sidewalk near the intersection of Zhoushan Road and Huishan Road. The words "Long Live Hitler" were also written on the wall. Several Jewish refugees who were passing by attempted to erase the graffiti, but were attacked by about ten White Russians residing in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Jews Angered and Fight Back</p>
<p>Soon after, an elderly Jew was assaulted. Young Jews rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and began fighting with the White Russians. More and more Jews gathered, and seeing that the situation was not in their favor, most of the White Russians fled. The Huishan Police Station received a report and sent officers to the scene, arresting eighteen White Russians and two Jews. Except for the three White Russians who were fined 60 yuan in court yesterday, the rest were released from the police station after paying a bail of 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Subsequent Conflict Prevented</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday, another clash occurred between White Russians and Jews in the same area. However, officers quickly arrived and dispersed them. As a result, the Huishan Police Station has prohibited people from loitering on the streets since last night. It is believed that the fighting was politically motivated and instigated by Nazi elements in the city. Some White Russians residing in the Huishan area joined the fight upon seeing their fellow White Russians fighting with the Jews. They later told the police that they did not know the cause of the fighting.</p>

<p>The Daya Transportation Company at 437 Nanjing Road, was opened by Yan Dazai, Chen Yaoxian, Zhang Weirong, etc. On the 4th of this month, Qi Shenlin, who lives at 24 Zhizhong Lane, Henan Road, entrusted Daya to transport 1,000 bolts of cloth, worth 55,000 yuan, to Nanjing. Unexpectedly, many days passed without any news. When contacting Daya, the company had moved without notice. It was recently discovered that the Daya Transportation Company has moved to Room 308, 209 Zhaoming Road to continue operating. When Qi went to Daya to inquire a few days ago, all the owners had fled. Only the partners and accountants were invited to Room 429 of the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road. Since the negotiations were unsuccessful, the General Inspectorate was informed and dispatched detectives to arrest Yang Qijue, Zhang Mingtong, Wang Zhting, Lu Ziliang, and women Zhang Gao, Gao Zhao, and Gao Yao, a total of seven people, and brought them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer Peng Qixin stated the case and requested their detention. After Judge Qiu interrogated them, he ordered Zhang, Yang, Wang, and Lu to be detained due to the main offender being at large, and allowed the three women to return home after being instructed to stay in place.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Dance Hostess Zhu Huiying Seduced and Defiled <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Huiying, an 18-year-old woman from Nanxiang, lives with her mother, Mrs. Yang, and her younger brother at No. 11 Weihou Lane, Route Lafayette. Due to financial difficulties, Zhu works as a dance hostess in the Yangzi Ballroom tea room to supplement her family's income with the money she earns from dancing. Wu Shougen, a man from Suzhou (27 years old, resident of No. 12 Baxian Lane, Baliqiao Road), is an assistant to the dance hostess manager in various ballrooms, so he is acquainted with Zhu. Recently, Wu introduced Zhu to work as a dance hostess at the Weigong Ballroom tea room during tea dance hours. The woman agreed because the time</p>
<p>did not conflict</p>
<p>and the income could be slightly increased. On the 21st of this month, when Zhu was leaving the tea dance, Wu used the excuse of going to see a movie to lure her to Room 103 of the Tianran Hotel on Zhifu Road, where he forcibly defiled her. After being raped, the woman initially endured in silence until yesterday, when her mother discovered it. She reported it to the Laoza Police Station, and Chinese Detective Qin Baili arrested Wu at the Yangzi Hotel. He was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi said that the defendant had confessed to</p>
<p>raping the woman</p>
<p>at the police station but claimed that the woman was suffering from venereal disease. Whether Zhu is infected with venereal disease is urgently awaiting a doctor's examination. Therefore, he requested a postponement. Wu also hired lawyer Wang Yigong to defend him. Judge Feng ordered him to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>

Wycliffe previously worked as a sailor on an American merchant ship and joined the Police Department in December of last year.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay, a member of the Indian National Congress, recently came to Shanghai from the United States. She plans to stay for two weeks and then travel to Chongqing. It is said that before leaving Shanghai, she will make a public statement to Chinese and foreign people, reporting on the current situation in India. According to what Mrs. Kamaladevi told reporters yesterday, India absolutely sympathizes with China's resistance to aggression and its heroic struggle. China's revolutionary movement has had a great impact on India. Today, India is also facing this problem head-on and must work hard to abolish the feudal system and resist imperialist aggression in order to establish a free and modern democratic civilization. Therefore, India also regards itself as one of the leaders of anti-imperialism. Mrs. Kamaladevi also said that although India has refused to participate in this World War, it is not anti-British, because the Nazis are more barbaric than other imperialists. Britain is also not conscripting large numbers of indigenous troops in India. All defense is entrusted to Australian and New Zealand troops. At present, all parts of India are showing signs of poverty.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Ministry of Education Orders Increased Funding for Social Education; Should Account for 10% to 20% of Total Education Expenses <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 25th) The Ministry of Education considers social education to be an important task in resisting aggression and nation-building. Recently, it has specifically ordered the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to pay attention to this and strive to expand it. However, the development of social education undertakings depends on the expansion of funding. According to the regulations of the National Government in October of the 17th year, social education funding should account for 10% to 20% of total education expenses. However, over the years, there have been some provinces and cities that have followed the regulations and fully raised funds, while many have not reached the prescribed standards or are far from it. Now is the time to prepare the budget for the 21st year, and social education funding should be earnestly increased and included. Those who have not reached the prescribed standards must raise the full amount. Those who have already reached the above standards should still appropriately increase it so that various undertakings can make significant progress.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Executive Yuan Orders Implementation: Teacher Treatment Regulations <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 25th Dispatch) The Executive Yuan, noting that in recent years, due to soaring prices, the salaries of teachers and staff in primary and secondary schools and workers in social education institutions across various regions have been insufficient to sustain livelihoods, leading to widespread anxiety, and even causing some to switch to other professions, which has significantly impacted the future of education, believes that those whose treatment is excessively low should be appropriately raised to ensure they can focus on their duties. The treatment of staff in national secondary schools and workers in national social education institutions has been gradually increased by the Ministry of Education. However, the treatment of teachers and staff in primary schools in various provinces and cities is particularly meager and should be earnestly implemented in accordance with various relevant treatment regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education. The Executive Yuan has now specifically ordered the provincial and municipal governments to comply with these regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e55">China Vocational Education Society: Recent Work Status <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The China Vocational Education Society's endeavors have flourished in recent years, becoming the center of vocational education in our country. The following is a record of the society's recent work: (1) Organizing Vocational Education Workshops: In order to enhance the specialized knowledge and skills of vocational education administrators and practitioners, the society is holding vocational education workshops during this summer vacation. Domestic vocational education experts are invited to lecture on various issues related to vocational education. The workshop venue is located at the China Vocational School in Baisha Tuo, Jiangbei. Classes began on July 7th and will continue until August 21st, totaling six weeks. (2) Preparing to Establish a Hong Kong Office: In recent years, the society has added work bases, including branches in Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Chengdu, and Shanghai. Recently, Huang Renzhi, a standing director of the society, went to Chongqing to solicit public bonds. In response to requests from people in Hong Kong, the society is establishing a Hong Kong office to promote vocational education in the port. Preparations are underway, and it is expected to be formally established within July. (3) Jointly Organizing Administrative Personnel Training Classes with the Ministry of Education: The society believes that the quality of administrative personnel in various institutions and organizations is crucial to work efficiency. Since administrative personnel in China have never received specialized training, the society initiated a joint administrative personnel training class with the Ministry of Education. Currently, all plans and methods are under review by the Ministry of Education and will soon be realized. This will be the first time Chinese administrative personnel receive formal training. (4) Establishing a Registration Station at Lianglukou for the Vocational Guidance Center: The Vocational Guidance Center, previously located at the Daliangzi YMCA, was moved to No. 5-6 Zhangjia Garden within the society after being bombed. Due to the large number of job seekers and employers, a registration station was established at the new YMCA building in Lianglukou for convenience, and work began on June 16th. (5) Jointly Organizing Vocational Guidance Personnel Training Classes with the Ministry of Social Affairs: The need for vocational guidance has become increasingly urgent after the war. The Ministry of Social Affairs, after its establishment, has paid close attention to this cause and is planning large-scale facilities. Recently, it will jointly organize vocational guidance personnel training classes with the society to train talent for selection and employment. The class was established on July 15th. (6) Compiling and Printing "Answers to College Admission Questions" to Distribute to Various Schools: The society has always been enthusiastic about guiding young people in college admissions. Each year, experienced and enthusiastic individuals are invited to give lectures on college admission guidance at various schools. Recently, due to the evacuation of various schools to the countryside, transportation has become extremely inconvenient. A type of "Answers to College Admission Questions" has been specially compiled and distributed to various schools to replace separate lectures.</p>

<p>(Hong Kong Communication) After touring the Malaysian Islands and returning to Hong Kong, there are many rumors that the ball king Li Huitang will hang up his boots this season, hoping to end his more than 20 years of football career. According to reporters, Li's saying of retiring had been around for a year or so, but as a result, Li still galloped on the field. Because Li is getting older and no longer young, the former position is particularly hard to do. Li has decided to change to the position of inside defender starting this season. In the previous battle against the Military Alliance, Li Min has tried to serve as the left inner defender, and the result is very satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Disease of the侠盗 <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hong</p>
<p>Two young students, admiring the actions of the chivalrous thief Arsène Lupin, practiced robbing the rich to help the poor, leading to legal trouble. This matter will be announced on the 30th. Undoubtedly, the result is a seven-year imprisonment. Our society still regards this type of event as an ordinary crime. In court, the students' school report cards were retrieved, proving that the two defendants usually had good conduct. Thus, the two heartbroken mothers became confused, "I really don't know how they did this illegal thing." Our society only sees that they broke the law and has not paid attention to the reasons why they broke the law. This is like a doctor only seeing the patient's symptoms of headache and foot pain without finding the source of the disease. How can such treatment be effective? Yes, from a scientific point of view, we should treat this case like a disease. It is a psychological disease, a mental disease. Imitating the chivalrous thief Arsène Lupin is only the outbreak of the disease. When they were at home, "dutifully" indulging in detective novels, the disease was already incubating and progressing. Defects in the family or environment (such as parents' or family members' lack of understanding and wrong attitudes towards young people) are often the root cause of the disease, detective novels are the fuse, and chivalrous theft is the outbreak of the disease. We know that sending patients to jail instead of sending them to the hospital is a stupid act, but we still send these two "sick" young people to jail because our society does not understand that this is a disease. This is a great sigh!</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3 id="e67">Robbing the Rich to Help the Poor <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>The event of two young students studying detective science 'robbing the rich to help the poor', after being published in the newspaper, was a sensation for a while, especially because these two 18-year-old youths used detective knowledge, making it impossible for the police authorities to investigate for a while, which aroused everyone's interest even more. Various newspapers have made a lot of criticisms about this matter, but most of their focus is on attacking bad reading materials. This is indeed a point of view, but I think this point of view is not thorough enough, this point of view has not grasped the core of the problem.</p>
<p>We should pay attention to the selection of youth reading materials in the future, and we should spare no effort to eliminate poisonous reading materials that mislead young people. This is right. However, this is only a temporary solution. Fundamentally, we should regard this matter as a matter of psychological hygiene, a matter of family education, and a matter of understanding young people. Otherwise, even if we make bad reading materials disappear from the market, these kinds of events of young people going astray will continue to happen, at most they will only be expressed in a different way.</p>
<p>Adolescents in their youth, when their hearts are surging and they cannot control themselves in everything, especially need the friendship, guidance, and understanding of adults. The spiritual comfort that adults give them is the safety valve for their intense emotions. When they lack psychological comfort, they will definitely find an adventurous way out for themselves, and then, trouble will happen. Robbing the rich to help the poor is just a way for them to fill the spiritual void.</p>
<p>It is said that these two young people had previously asked their parents to donate some money to the children's orphanage, but were opposed by their parents, and therefore felt very dissatisfied. If this situation is true, then we dare to assert that these two parents must not understand the psychology of young people, must not have given their children a good face, especially in ordinary times, and must not have gained the trust of their children. Otherwise, this kind of event would not have happened.</p>
<p>Donating money to charity organizations is a good thing, and it is worth praising that children have this kind of vision. Even if it is not possible to agree for some special reason, an attempt should be made to explain it to the children with a sympathetic attitude, so as not to cause misunderstandings among the children. Although this seems like a small matter, it is very important. Because the core of the problem may be here.</p>
<p>It is not right to put the responsibility for this kind of event completely on the ignorant young people. It is also unreasonable to regard this kind of thing as an ordinary crime. When this type of event occurs, we see the need to organize juvenile courts even more. We believe that it is better to hand over this case to psychologists than to judges.</p>

<h3 id="e68">We Go to the Bomb Shelter <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>The weather is clear, predicting that there will be another "air raid alarm". (When there is an air raid alarm, we go to the bomb shelter, which we call "running the air raid alarm.")</p>
<p>After the war. People in Chongqing have quite old qualifications in "running the air raid alarm". Usually, all valuable things, things they like, and treasured things worth keeping as souvenirs are packed up and organized. When there is an air raid alarm, everyone becomes busy. Those that can be worn are worn, those that can be worn are worn, and others are taken.</p>
<p>Ladies and Misses also change into good clothes and go to the bomb shelter. The reason is: it is inconvenient to carry clothes in your hands, and you have to take other things. It is better to wear them on your body.</p>
<p>Also, because the weather is hot, people are afraid that the air in the cave is unpleasant; therefore, some people even put on perfume. However, although the weather is hot, it is very cool in the cave, as if there is air conditioning equipment! The temperature difference with the outside of the cave is twenty or thirty degrees! Therefore, everyone brings a woolen coat, a cashmere shirt, or a jacket.</p>
<p>In the bomb shelter, some people know each other, and some people don't know each other, but everyone will talk openly; it's very lively. We can take this opportunity to get to know many friends. Those who bring tea and snacks, those who bring fruit, exchange them and eat them. It is more interesting than any entertainment place! We often meet people who can tell jokes, spreading the seeds of laughter to people. It's like everyone is old friends!</p>
<p>There are also people who do small business, who also use this opportunity to sell things. There are fresh fruit juice, grapes, watermelon, American oranges (produced in Sichuan), peaches, crabapples, and apples.</p>
<p>On both sides of the bomb shelter, there are rows of seats, often leaving a road in the middle for free entry and exit.</p>
<p>Private bomb shelters are even more perfectly equipped. There are Go, there is chess, which can be a pastime. There are tables, there are chairs, or stone tables and stone benches. Tea is prepared. Sometimes, banquets are held in the cave.</p>
<p>There is a Western restaurant that is specially set up in the bomb shelter. They really understand psychology! You think: when you encounter an air raid alarm, you enter the bomb shelter; everyone has to take a break! You can also take this opportunity to socialize, or you can order something to eat and drink yourself. Well! In this kind of occasion and environment, after all, no one tightens the mouth of their money bag; they are reluctant to eat and drink! So this is a profitable business!</p>
<p>We go to the bomb shelter calmly, as if going to a gathering. Really! You can meet your friends! And there is a firm belief: "Final victory is ours."</p>

<h3 id="e69">The Attitude of Parents <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>The most important thing in raising children is the attitude problem. First of all, first, parents should be humble. This does not mean that parents are inferior to their children, but that parents should be modest and cautious in treating their children.</p>
<p>Many parents always think that their judgment is absolutely correct, which is a big mistake. We should remember that parents also make mistakes sometimes - if you wronged or wronged your child, you must sincerely apologize to him.</p>
<p>The second is to suppress emotions. Children will definitely follow their self-control when they see a good example from their parents. It cannot be considered fair for parents to do whatever they want all day long, and then punish their children for their wayward behavior.</p>
<p>Children are born extremists. This week they love dolls, and next week they like to play with balls. The responsibility of parents is to teach them to take a moderate attitude towards work and games.</p>
<p>The third is tolerance. Sometimes children's mistakes should be tolerated. A child has limited experience and knowledge, and some actions that adults consider wrong may be considered reasonable by them. Therefore, parents should often put themselves in the child's shoes.</p>
<p>However, tolerance is not letting children act wildly and not exercising control. Reasonable discipline is very helpful to the development of the child's personality. Parents must teach their children to love cleanliness, keep order, be agile, and be responsible. In addition, parents should also teach their children to be tolerant of other people's shortcomings.</p>

<p>"In that case, who else would want to be a mentor?" She thought for over ten minutes, barely coming up with an answer she deemed satisfactory. "They must not have been that careless when accepting disciples, which is why those they teach always turn out well." As for whether the Shang family's maternal uncle, mentioned by the Meng family's little steward, would be willing to take her on as a disciple, Mei Bao was not worried; although she couldn't find a mirror in her own house, she had at least seen her reflection in the neighbor's house and at school hundreds of times. Furthermore, since she was little, many villagers and friends in the school had constantly praised her. How could she not know whether she was pretty or ugly? Moreover, she had studied for eight or nine years, always ranking first or second. She certainly didn't believe that singing opera would be more difficult than studying.</p>
<p>"Don't tell Dad first. Wait until I've learned for ten or fifteen days, then sing for him and give him a big surprise!" She thought naively, almost laughing on her pillow.</p>
<p>From the third day onward, Mei Bao began learning opera. A middle-aged man, whom she had never had any connection with, began to drill into her life like a screw, thanks to the introduction by Aunt Meng and her father-in-law. This was the Shang family's maternal uncle mentioned by the Meng family's little steward. In reality, he was the younger brother of the Meng family's old manager, a half-way house convert who never managed to become famous on stage. True, he was also a Dan actor, but even if all the Xiaosangzi actors in China were dead, it wouldn't be his turn to play Zhao Gao's daughter in "Cosmic Wind". Sorry, let's pause for a moment. In any case, this fellow was assigned to play a dumb slave. It's not hard to imagine what his act was like!</p>
<p>However, no matter how bad his act was, no matter how bad his luck was, he still had eyes; for the past decade or two, he had been coming and going in and out of theaters, inadvertently seeing the daily life of those big stars too clearly. As a result, the kind of envy and jealousy he felt grew day by day. If you want to describe it in words, the Kangxi Dictionary simply couldn't come up with a suitable word. (168)</p>

<h3 id="e72">The Burgeoning Business of American Movies <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Si Wen</p>
<p>The United States is the most developed in this area, so American cinema installations are constantly changing and developing. Recently, a new fad has emerged that looks very much like an outdoor cinema, but inside, there are no comfortable seats. Instead, all viewers must bring their own cars and sit comfortably in their cars to watch the movie being projected.</p>
<p>The organizer, named Smith, calls it a drive-in movie theater. The theater site occupies three acres. On this open plain, a steel frame thirty feet high is erected. On this frame, a screen forty-eight feet high and sixty-five feet wide is installed. Whenever the show starts, each person first pays a ticket price of thirty-five cents, then drives straight into the grounds, arranging themselves in order. The people in the cars sit quietly in their vehicles, enjoying the clear scenes on the screen. In this vast area, up to six hundred cars can be parked. Averaging three people per car, that's one thousand eight hundred people. But in reality, it is not as noisy as a regular one thousand eight hundred-seat cinema. Moreover, it eliminates the need for each cinema to set up a parking lot to accommodate viewers' parking needs. At the same time, viewers are no longer at risk of car theft.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of this type of cinema, everyone has felt a novel interest. In general, clever film merchants have been catering to the psychology of the masses. Today, twelve drive-in cinemas have been opened throughout the United States, and several more are being designed and built. In the future, it will definitely be all the rage!</p>
<h3 id="e73">Watching Zhou Weijun's "Meeting of Heroes" <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Mingkang</p>
<p>This spring, Zhou Xinfang performed "Meeting of Heroes" twice, playing two roles alone. It was beautiful, but unfortunately, his portrayal of Zhou Yu was not quite satisfactory. I always thought that if this role could be assigned to Ye ShengLan or Zhou Weijun, it would be several times more wonderful. Now Weijun has indeed come, but Xinfang has stopped performing. I realize that my ideal is just an ideal, and it is not easy to achieve in reality.</p>
<p>According to "Meeting of Heroes," the Xiaosheng role is actually more important than the Laosheng. I have seen Ye ShengLan lead the Fu Liancheng troupe to perform in Hangaothe play which he often used as a banner. Although Yu Zhenfei has also performed it recently, he omitted the sword dance segment, which seems to be a loss of brilliance. This is because his strengths were not being used, so he cannot be blamed. As for the "pheasant tail" style, in the contemporary era, apart from ShengLan, Zhou Weijun is the most outstanding. Unfortunately, on his way to Shanghai, he caught a cold and fell ill. Therefore, the "Meeting of Heroes" on the second night of his performance was inevitably a bit perfunctory. When he recovered and performed again, his sharpness was revealed. He deserved praise for raising the pitch of the line "At the Meeting of Heroes, I should be drunk and full" in the original melody, completing it in one breath without any effort, and the lingering sound was like a thin thread, with the impression of circling the rafters three times. As for his swordsmanship skills, judging from his diligent martial arts training in recent years, he is definitely more than capable. The Carlton management values his skills. They repeatedly asked him to perform "Eight Great Hammers" and other dramas at the Zaguanlou, which were always sold out and highly praised by the audience. When the term expired, although the theater tried hard to retain him, the Xu sisters insisted on not letting him go. Therefore, whether he will renew his contract for the next term has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3 id="e74">My Thoughts on "The Chain Trap" <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Faisheng</p>
<p>The other day, I read Mr. Lao Tu's article "Idle Chat on The Chain Trap" in this publication, which could not help but arouse some of my thoughts on the play. Let me jot them down below:</p>
<p>What I want to talk about here is not about acting skills, but about the play's meaning, because the performance of "The Chain Trap" mostly demonstrates the inherent virtues of our country. Among them, Huang Tianba's solo visit to the mountain undoubtedly shows his extreme courage and fearless spirit. At the same time, it also shows his faithful heart willing to take responsibility, which is certainly worthy of people's admiration! As for Dou Erdun, being able to not rely on the large number of people in the mountain stronghold and use force on the spot in the mountain stronghold with a Huang Tianba who had no support is not only showing the grandeur of his character but also showing - simply representing - the unique virtue of our national character of never bullying the weak, which is so worthy of praise! After his rupture with Huang Tianba, it can be said that there was already a situation where two heroes could not coexist, but he still paid attention to etiquette, and still used the ceremony of receiving Tianba up the mountain to send Tianba down the mountain, which seems to be comparable to the current practice of warring countries exchanging envoys, because there is no so-called reciprocity between them!</p>
<p>One more thing worthy of attention is the issue of keeping promises. When Dou and Huang had agreed to compete in martial arts at the foot of the mountain tomorrow, Dou Erdun's most skilled and familiar weapon - double hooks - was suddenly stolen by Zhu Guangzu using clever tricks. If he wanted to prepare the same weapon and ask for an extension, it was not absolutely impossible under the circumstances at the time, but in order to respect his promise, the so-called word of a man, he finally rashly kept his appointment, and although he suffered a crushing defeat, he was still a hero who was glorious even in defeat. Tao has never been a social education aid, and it is also a great assistant to cultural propaganda.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Establishment of the Yisheng Drama Arts Society <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Yuanshen</p>
<p>Recently, a group of students studying at Fudan, Aurora, Jinan, Southeast, and Nantong University of Political Science and Law, along with dozens of young people who love art, formed a club named "Yisheng Drama Arts Society." The scope of Yisheng is very broad, including Peking opera, spoken drama, singing, sports, and academics, all of which are related to youth self-cultivation.</p>
<p>In terms of Peking opera, they have invited many famous amateur performers from Shanghai to serve as instructors. In terms of spoken drama, Tian Zhendong and Ma Ling are leading the way. They are currently rehearsing Xiong Foxi's "The Executioner" and Ma Ling's "Alarm Clock." These two plays will be performed at the "Lafayette" in the future. Experts have also been hired to guide the singing, sports, and academic aspects, such as vocal training, swimming, ice skating, technical training, and the study of Mandarin and English.</p>
<p>Currently, they have more than one hundred male and female members, mostly students from various universities, and the rest are middle school students and young people from professional circles.</p>
<p>The group's position is very strict, and its purpose is pure. The persons in charge of the society are Zheng Xuelin and Gu Jiyun.</p>
<p>The origin of Yisheng states: "The reason why people can survive depends on grouping. Because people have different abilities, and one person's ability is still difficult to plan for one person's survival. It is necessary to use one's strengths to supply the shortcomings of hundreds of people, and to use the strengths of hundreds of people to supply the shortcomings of one person. In this way, exchanging what one has for what one lacks, benefiting each other, the benefits of mankind will naturally arise...</p>
<p>The reporter hopes that the young people will earnestly work hard based on this principle. You see: Hua Lian and Yiyou are not already doing very well?</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Refusing to Bow Down in the Wilderness</p>
<p>Before Liu Yining could finish speaking, the little maid said, "The old lady has passed away!" Liu Yining was shocked when he heard this and said, "How could my aunt be gone from this world? How did she die?" Xu Jing was also very surprised. The little maid continued, "Young Master Liu, when you left, wasn't the old lady just recovering from her illness? Every day she didn't see you, she would call me to her bedside to ask. But I didn't know where you had gone. I only said that yesterday an official sent a letter here. The old lady then guessed that you must have gone down the mountain to kill bandits. She was even more depressed and blamed you for not telling her explicitly, leaving her alone here. If there were jackals or bandits here, wouldn't she just be waiting to die? She became even more anxious, and her illness worsened. Coincidentally, two wolves came outside the door at night and howled sadly for a long time. The next day, the old lady's condition became critical. There was nothing I could do alone, so I had to run to the Guan Wang Temple on Shigu Peak to the east and ask the wise old monk to treat her. But after taking the old monk's medicine, it was still ineffective. She passed away peacefully the day before yesterday evening. The funeral arrangements were all taken care of by the wise old monk with my help. Now it is placed in the hall, and it has not yet been buried." As the little maid said this, the tears in Liu Yining's eyes fell like broken strings of pearls. Xu Jing couldn't help but sigh sadly. The two walked to the middle hall. When Liu Yining saw the spiritual seat placed in the middle, with the fragrant curtains swaying sadly in the wind and the white candles dripping tears, he immediately knelt down in front of the seat and cried loudly, "Aunt, I really am sorry for you. If I had known that you were going to leave this world, I wouldn't have dared to leave. Alas! If my uncle knew in the afterlife, wouldn't he deeply blame me for being unfilial? Now I'm back, does aunt know? But I can no longer see your kind face. The crime of unfilial piety will be a lifelong regret. Aunt, please have pity on me and forgive me." As he said this, he showed a look of extreme grief. Xu Jing had no choice but to comfort him from the side, "Of course you couldn't have foreseen this. But you left here for the sake of the country, and your aunt and uncle's spirits will surely be able to forgive your difficulties. I advise you to control your grief and take care of yourself." The little maid hid to the side and just wiped away her tears. Xu Jing persuaded him several times before he was finally able to stop. (125)</p>

<p>— N腔B調人 作傳 Zhang Yizhang Production Map</p>
<p>(Editor's note) This magazine has published twenty-four articles. I am very grateful to N Qiang B Diao Ren for writing the biographies. However, because his duties are cumbersome, he will no longer continue to write. We were unable to retain him, so from this article onwards, Mr. Zheng Guoyi will be taking over. Please pay attention, readers.</p>
<p>(Twenty-five) Jin Zhongren</p>
<p>Jin Zhongren was originally a member of the Qing Dynasty's imperial family. He went into acting as an amateur and has achieved profound attainments in both civil and martial arts, Kunqu opera and miscellaneous dramas, but he is limited by his voice and cannot rely on singing to compete with others. He is good at performing new plays and has made many clarifications on "translation of subjects" and "actions", not falling into old patterns. Xun Huisheng's new plays are all written by Chen Moxiang, and they often contain many humorous interpolations. Zhongren is the most successful in the Xiaosheng role in this area, so Huisheng has relied on him like his right and left hands over the years and has never left him. After losing his spouse, he remarried Little Cuihua's sister. Zhongren is more than twice as old as Cuihua's sister, which is very inappropriate, but Cuihua does not regard it as a dislike. Colleagues suspect that Cuihua is using this to coerce Zhongren into cooperating with her and make him leave Huisheng, so she does not hesitate to be so wronged. Although it is impossible to know whether this is true or not, Zhongren did join Cuihua's troupe shortly after. People say that it is unfortunately true, which is a fact. As a result, Huisheng was very angry and broke with Zhongren. Before long, Huisheng happened to be rehearsing a new play, "Deceiving His Wife to Marry His Sister." Zhongren felt very dissatisfied with the naming of the play, which obviously contained sarcasm. Since then, the two have become increasingly estranged, and they have not reconciled to this day. There is no hope of working together again. Zhongren is good at new plays, and the protagonists regard his actions as important, as a judgment of victory or defeat, strength or weakness. One can also get a glimpse of this from this. Zhongren has an excellent foundation in martial arts. His exploration of Zhuang Yaguan Tower is quite wonderful. His plays such as Zhen Tanzhou and Xiongzhou Pass are also worth watching. He is good at expressing emotions. His An Ji in Romance of Heroes and Heroines and his Lu Kunjie in Deliberate Match are extremely vivid. As for the eighth son of Yang in Yanmen Pass, no one in his contemporary peers can compete with him.</p>
