<p>社評</p>
<h3>美德關侮的新階段</h3>
<p>羅賓摩爾號的沉失，在美國已經引起非常激昂的輿情，種種不同的報復手段都有人加以建議，儼然又是一九一五年琉西丹尼亞事件發生後的景象。但在美國政府，縱其目前對歐戰的地位已遠超過二十五年的絕對中立以上，其於此案則極見沉着審愼，在消息開始傳來時曾竭力避免主觀與感情的支配，而冷靜的從事搜集關於沉船的事實經過。至今事實判明，不只證實羅賓摩爾號的擊沉確屬德方潛艇所爲，德官方在十三日的表示已悍然以此自承，且更暗示着這一類的不幸事件還將要在所謂「違禁品」的理由之下繼續重演。如果以此際納粹對美態度和一九一五年之對美多方解釋和保證比較看來，當可嘹然於目前國際情勢之嚴重，實絕非琉西丹尼亞事件發生時所能比擬。</p>
<p>在一個戰爭將要爆發的前夜，照例要經過一個法理是非的爭論時期，美德雙方，此際正在經歷着此一過程。德方諉稱羅賓摩爾號之被擊沉是因爲載有「違禁品」其所以「違禁」，則因爲英國曾列爲「違禁品」之故；即使所稱確屬事實，那也只能算是很滑稽的理由，因爲德方根本沒有權利把英方對於「違禁品」的界說加到美國商輪和貨物上去。對於所謂「違禁品」者，雖各國各有其不同的觀點，但照德方的說明，到確可證明該輪所載並非軍用品一類—當中立法尚未實行取消的此際，用美船運送軍用品赴英根本不可能—更何况該船所開赴的開浦鎭縱係「英國口岸」，却非戰爭區域，如此而竟在美洲領地附近予以擊沉，這除却對美挑釁而外，實毫無理由可言，而美人之憤怒自屬當然。關於海上作戰原有國際公法的規定，在實際運用上則幾等於毫無效力，在納粹當局對於曾經簽字生效的正式條約且不惜輕易予以撕毀，更無論於本乏拘束能力的國際公法。是以美方對德如提抗議，必將絕無結果，有類於歷史上這一類的交涉一樣。此外更如紅海區域曾被納粹劃爲戰區，美方始終未予承認，且已將軍火開始向近東輸送，這當然又是一個足以在美德之間引起更多糾紛的因素。</p>
<p>近一年中，美國對軸心的憎恨與其對英國的支援，在在都與歐戰的緊張情勢成正比例而進展，這一點德方知之至審，是以從很早就不再做從外交上緩和美國的幻想。而另一方面，其對美怨恨亦只藉陰謀搆煽與任情詆毀爲發洩，至於實際上的對美敵對行動，則當以此次的羅賓摩爾事件爲嚆矢。固然，爲了牽制美國的援英與參戰，德國早已在太平洋上安排下了一個三國同盟的第三條，不過其所覓取的對象並不絕對忠於盟的；而且假如美國將來是因爲應付德方的挑釁而應戰，則盟約效力的解釋亦須大費周章。對於這些情形，希特勒當亦知之至審，則此度德之擊沉美船，可信其用意並不在促成美國的早日參戰，因爲那不只斷非軸心之利，且其所已佈置下的牽制力量也並不可靠。跡其用心，大槪除却藉以報復美國對於極權和侵略的深惡痛絕，以免因爲長期隱忍而引起內部威望的失墮而外，更針對着美國參戰準備與情緒尚未十分成熟的弱點進行攻勢，用以牽制羅斯福援英的積極步驟。</p>
<p>連日美方情緒，雖也有些許孤立主張與畏戰心理雜出其間，在大體上却只有憤激與在怒。美副國務卿所稱美人不爲威脅所動一語正是對於納粹暴行的最好答覆。美當局第一步的應付大槪將採外交手段，十四日凍結一切德義在美資金的命令雖與沉船一舉無關，却也可算是一個事實上的答覆，而武裝商船嚴厲對付德潛艇等步驟則更早已在醞釀之中。日前羅斯福的爐邊談話僅只述及保證援英戰具的到達，並未明言進一步將採何等手段和方式，假如說那是內部尚有若干困難未能克服，則此度德方的剽襲無疑當又替美政府消除了一部分阻力，促進美德間更尖銳的衝突以至於從事戰爭。一隻商船的沉失，反響縱極重大，尚不足以搆成立即參戰的理由，即以上次大戰而言，參戰的實行也是在許多美輪繼續做了無限制潛艇戰的犧牲品之後；但此次事件所加於美國社會以至人民心理上的影響，也許比較美當局的大聲疾呼更能收到震聾發瞶的結果，使美人相信至低限度也不能不從事於武力自衛，而對納粹的作戰也終於無可避免。目前希特勒的注意力正集中在近東和歐洲東北部，但是不久他當能感到來自大西洋彼岸的力量纔是他的最大威脅，</p>

<h3>述工商業提存特別準備</h3>
<p>— 王文楠</p>
<p>近年來一般工商業之所以能獲鉅利者，其主因之一，無非幣值變動存貨暴漲而已，故每屆年終決算時，帳上均可結出驚人之利益，實則多係帳面虛值，而非眞實財富，蓋將來物價平復之時，一般工商企業，因其必須保持經常數量之存貨，以應其營業上之需要，則勢必同樣遭存物價跌落之損失，目前所稱之盈餘，在他日豈不仍等於零，若於今日對於此類存貨漲價之盈餘，仍照平時辦法，分配紅利，一旦物價跌落，必遭損失，而巳分派之紅利，無法收回，影響所及，勢必牽累事業木身，雖公司有於盈餘中，提出十分之一公積金之規定，然為數有限，尚不足應將來抵補之需要，故政府為維護工商各業，以謀日後復興準備起見，特由經濟部訂定，「非常時期工商業提存特別準備辦法」計分八項，業經行政院核准，於本年四月十四日公佈施行。凡一般公電粗織之企業，自本年度起，一律遵守實行，不佞茲就其辦法內容，爰抒管見如次：</p>
<p>（一）特別準備提存辦法　按特別準備辦法第二項之規定，凡依公司祖織之工商業，每屆營業年度終了有盈餘時，除依法令提存公積金等之規定外，應依左列規定提存特別準備。</p>
<p>一·盈餘在實收資本總額五分一以上者提盈餘百分之十</p>
<p>二·　餘　實收、　　　四分一以上　提盈餘百分之二十</p>
<p>三·盈餘在實收資本總額三分一以上者一律提盈餘百分之三十</p>
<p>依上所述，所謂公司組織之工商業乃指曾向政府登記已經核准設立之公司，均須遵守該辦法之各項規定，設有某股份有限公司實收資本總額為十萬元，本年營業結果，計得盈餘二萬一千元合資本總額五分一以上，照上述第一目規定，除應提存法定公積計二千一百元外尚須提存百分之十特別準備，計二千一百元，觀於上例，可知一般公司粗織之企業，若年終盈餘，超過實收資本總額百分之二十以上者除另提法定公積金外，即須照其規定，提存特別準備，以防將來物價變動，用為抵補意外損失。</p>
<p>（二）專款存儲按期呈報　此項特別準備，規定應專款存儲銀行，以便當局隨時檢查，是吾提存足額，同時規定，每屆營業年度終了後一月，應將營業報吿書，資產負債表，財產目錄，損益計算書，呈送主管官署陳報經濟部備核，惟目下滬市行政官署，暫行結束，在未恢復原狀前，本市工商各業，得逕行呈報經濟部，以資迅速。</p>
<p>（三）納稅與用途之規定　特別準備有不得免稅之規定，則一般公司組織之企業，繳納斯得院及過份利得稅時，此頃準備，仍應併入計算應納稅額，不予減除，以免影響政府稅牧，用於其用途，規定除提補意外損失外，非經經濟部核准，不得任意分派。</p>
<p>（四）違反各項規定之處罰　凡違反該辦法各項規定，未將特別準備提存足額，或有偽報情事，經查出後得依公司法第二百三十二條之規定，對於公司執業之股東，發起人，董事及監察人等，科以一千元以下之罰金。</p>
<p>政府訂立此種辦法之目的，完全為工商業本身着想，深切指示各業，切勿惑於目前之畸形繁榮，而所略鞏固事業之募礎，為今未雨綢繆計，應多提充分準備，惟防將來物價下落時，藉作意外損失之抵補，具見政府深謀遠慮，還望一般公司組織之工商業，仰體政府維護之德意，領導各業，切實遵行，其於復興實業準備，至關重要也。</p>
<h3>蘇聯對外貿易機構</h3>
<p>太平洋上的運貨船現在雖仍很忙，靠着舶來品支持的上海市面，却已擔心着這種貨船中止來滬的那一天。大家都抱着一個矛盾的情緒；那就是美國不參戰，世界和平不易就恢復。然而美國參戰了，上海的日子可不好過。到那時，不好過的理由太多而且又太嚴重了，舶來品來源斷絕，也是使人挺焦悶的。</p>
<p>雖則如此，大家也不是無以自慰的。大家相信「船到橋頭自會直」的那句土話，更有人在具體地構想着那時的蘇聯，或許是上海局面的支撐者。雖則蘇聯未必肯掮這根濕木梢，而且蘇聯遲早也有捲入漩渦的那一天。更重要的，斯太林的心倒底擺在右側？還是偏向左面？假使右傾，上海照樣完了。然不管他怎樣，上海的工商界，似乎已在恭候蘇聯出品的光臨了。而蘇聯出品，似乎也法意到遠東的這個大市塲了。最近上海市內的蘇商和接近蘇商的掮客們，已在大肆活躍。這是一個完全新的恣態。蘇中貿易公司巳經開門了，但在虹口，令人可望而不可即。聽說還有一個實力更大的聯華洋行在籌備中，地點在法租界，環繞他的又有利華貿易公司，四達洋行等掮客組織。</p>
<p>然而蘇聯的劉外貿易是國營的，有計劃的。他的計劃是完全依照他自己的原則，國外市塲需要不在他計劃之中。所以上海需要的他未必有，他可以供給的上海未必要。又因為他的出口，原屬本國過剩生產的排洩作用，旣不講究包裝，又不劃一其包裝的重量單位。交貨不合標準而發生商事上的爭議時，爭議雙方一面是商人，一面是蘇聯政府機關，仲栽與仲栽效力都發生問題。因之上海的蘇商目前雖很活躍，穩健朋友依舊疇躇小前。</p>
<p>除了這些實際問題之外，更使人困難的要算是對於蘇聯貿易制度的根本不瞭解。大家久知他是國營的，却不知道他在怎樣國營？而上述的那些所謂實際問題，事實上就因根本不瞭解而發生的。</p>
<p>蘇聯的對外貿易，以外國貿易人民委員部為最高機關·一九三〇年，才脫離國內貿易委員部而獨立辦理。他之和國內貿易所以分離，實係注意國際競爭的開始。該部的主要機能有四（一）確立貿易政策；（二）執行上項政策的實施；（三）處理關稅事務；（四）組織對外貿易之經營機關·因之部內設有各種專職機關。其中主要的有國營管理局，計劃廳，貿易政策廳，稅務廳，輸出部，輸入部，匯兌部，對外貿易損失防止局，合理局，出口貨品質國家監督局等。一九四〇年六月起，對外貿易人民委員會主席為米可耶，副主席為考爾契可夫，貿易人民委員為斯鐵巴諾夫等九人。該部在各聯邦自治共和國內都派有專員，在國外則以「通商代表部」名義代表該部執行監督與指揮等職。此「商務代表部」，可謂為對外貿易人民委員部的支部，同時也可作為蘇聯外交機關的一種。執行商的等的談判與簽訂之職。故其下由兩部份構成。一部份專司全般事務，並對另一部份及其他相關機關負監督之職。另一部份即專司進出口實際業務之職。現在蘇聯派有商務代表部者有：</p>
<p>英國之倫敦　奧大利之維也納　德國之柏林　丹麥之哥平哈經　意大利之撤列諾　波蘭之華沙　土耳其之斯坦布爾瑞典之斯特孔化　挪威之奧斯洛　波斯之田黑拉　希臘之雅典　外蒙古之買賣城　法國之巴黎　日本之東京</p>
<p>此外在英國，美國之阿根廷均設有專門的貿易公司；對遠東貿易，又有特種的貿易機關。同時又依商品別而設立各種專職機關。下面我們把各該機關負責經營的商品名稱錄下，但其機關各稱因太長故改以號數編示之。</p>

<h3>棉市新聞知識</h3>
<p>— 張一凡先生講　馮志達記</p>
<p>—滬江大學商學院「商業新聞」教材—</p>
<p>全世界棉花產量，年約一萬萬担以上·美國產量最多，其次是印度，中國年產的一千餘萬担，居第三位。</p>
<p>產棉區　我國產棉區極廣，黃河流域之魯豫晉秦隴六省，長江流域之吳越皖贛湘鄂蜀七省皆是·他如西南之雲實夸桂等省亦盛。加以紡織勞働者又佔全國勞働者羣中最多數。由此可知棉業興衰，關係我整個國民經濟者極大。</p>
<p>品質　棉花的優劣，除質地潔淨乾燥無攙水攙羅外，決定於牠的纖維之長度，闊度，撚度，强度。纖維長紡出之紗細，反之短。普通紡紗用纖維長度之標準為：</p>
<p>我國所產之棉花，可大別為二種，一種是「土種花」；一種是「改良種」，像「美種花」之類。土種花僅適用紡十二支至十六支紗；改良花，好的像山東的美種花，特別是「靈寳花」（河南）為最優良，因其纖維平均在一英寸以上，可紡二十支至三十二支以上之細紗，支數多的是細紗；反之是組紗。大體而論，國產花可紡二十支紗者為最多。</p>
<p>纖維長短，視紡織用途而定，最忌長短不齊。織維長者性柔軟，反之則剛。經紗宜用剛性原紗，緯紗以柔軟為貴。所謂撚度强度，指每英吋織維之絞度，撚度高者性堅靸，反之則鬆柔。海島棉每吋撚曲度達二四〇分，埃及棉為一八〇分，巴西棉一四〇分，印度棉一二〇分，國產棉大致與印棉相彷。</p>
<p>等級　便利棉花交易計，交易所裹把各種花評定其等級·我國以國產細絨花可紡二十支紗者為標準。第一級可充三十二支原料，靈寶花，洛陽花，天津美種花，山東美種花均屬之。第二級即標準級，如天津細絨，山東細絨，常陰細絨，沙市與漢口的高級細絨，通州細絨，東台細絨等。第三級為十六支紗原料，如漢口，沙市等細絨及上海，太倉等棉產。第四級為十支以下原料，如餘姚，山東，漢口，天津等之組絨皆是。每級內又分甲乙丙丁四等。過去我國標花以可紡十六支者為準，戰前改為二十支者，此係我紡織技術水準進步與棉質改良的表現。但棉質改良尚兼落後。故國棉產量雖多，但細紗原料　需國外輸入，而以輸出國棉以抵償國際收支。</p>
<p>美棉在紐的交易所上分九級，即：（一）Middling　fair（二）Strict　good　Midding（三）Good　Middling（四）Strict　Middling。以上都係上級。第五為Middling，即標準級，報載米特令者即是。次為（六）Strict　low　Middling　（七）low　Middling　（八）Strict　good　ordinary（九）Goodordinary。</p>
<p>印度棉在孟買交易所上分七級，即：（一）Extra　Superfine（二）Super　fine（三）Strict　fine，第四級為fine，即標準級。其下為（五）wall　up　fine（六）Barely　fine（七）fullygood。但印棉花在上海交易時用產地名分類，即白洛去Broaca亞姆拉Gmra平茄爾Brengal，白洛去與平茄爾為第四級標準花，長7/8吋與5/8吋。可紡二十六至二十八支紗。亞姆拉是二十支紗原料。</p>
<p>交易　上海的棉花交易，在戰前分現貨與期貨二類。買賣單位：在交易所市塲上，現貨為五十司馬担，期貨為一百司馬担。行市以每担值國幣元計，叫價單位為五分。期貨有一個月至六個月期限。現在都做現貨。外棉則向洋行做定期貨。價格仍以司馬担計，交易則用包計。每包重量不一，有如次列：</p>
<p>印棉（一般的）　四〇〇磅　巴西棉　四〇〇磅</p>
<p>（南部的）　五〇〇磅　埃及棉　七三〇磅</p>
<p>緬甸棉　四〇〇磅　非洲棉　四〇〇磅</p>
<p>美棉　五〇〇磅</p>
<p>國產棉包裝分鐵卷，大包，中包，小包，麻包五種，鐵卷用布包而捆以鐵皮，重四百十斤左右，大包重一百八十斤左右，中包重一百二十五斤左右，小包重六十斤左右。</p>
<p>紐約交易所上所做期貨以十二個月為限，而以每年一，三，五，七，十，十一月份之交易最盛。買賣單位一百包，每似重五〇〇磅。市塲叫價單位為美棉一磅值美金分。故合法幣價之算式為：</p>
<p>孟買市塲上交易單位為一百包，每包四〇〇磅。交易單位為一康迭Candy（重七八四磅），其叫價單位即一康迭合　比數。故印棉合法幣價之算式為：</p>
<p>紐約棉花交易所由上午十時至三時為交易時間。孟買市塲則由上午十一時半至午後三時半</p>

<h3>蘭花子高貨看好</h3>
<p>蘭花子邇來到貨已乏、查市上存底僅數十件而已、但同時各幫需要亦屬淡薄、因此市勢無甚榮辱、高貨號存巳斷、行方手貨亦缺、故後市有看好之望、</p>
<h3>五金現貨軋缺　市面紛紛向榮</h3>
<p>邇來五金市面、因受海外來源閉塞、及本街底存極薄之影饗、故流通貨益感軋缺、各貨標準行惰因之紛粉向榮、同業心思亦因挺勃、整個市塲、反覺有市無貨之象、而實際成交、却未見熱鬧、茲分錄最近各貨概況如左、</p>
<p>大馬口鐵　二十四號與二十六號之美大馬口鐵、現貨久已吿缺、刻市所能應市者、僅北蘇州路某家五金號、略有少數現貨買賣外、其他所存更屬微細、難以影響市勢焉、查該貨惟一去路、為滾筒作·鎖廠·機器廠家等、外埠納胃近巳告絕、而市氣以流通貨之單薄、十分高昂、人心對售盤一節、亦扳持甚堅、昨如二十四號貨每箱估一千二百元、二十六號花色每箱喊九百五十元、</p>
<p>竹節鋼條　竹節　鋼條交易、因本街建築幫納胃米展、外埠客商成交父屬微細、然因海外來路不繼、僅靠本市所存、究屬有限、同業覩此現象、其銷路雖呆、而市盤仍扳持甚堅、昨市行情、如三四分花色每噸須三千三百元、五分至一寸貨亦售三千二百五十元、較之前市、其暗盤趨勢、十分堅挺、</p>
<p>黑鐵坯子　近受市塲搜　殷急所致、市情異常挺秀、行情日漲百元之鉅、而本街製坯廠、印鐵廠·水瓶廠·及機器廠家等、相機進辦、市塲現貨單薄中、被搜更覺軋缺、致行盤又漲、刻如二千磅老鋼廠貨每紮佔三千七百元、新鋼　貨亦售三千六百元、比前再漲一百元云、</p>
<h3>派力司回昂</h3>
<p>派力司呢復又升漲之勢、洪盛貨每碼批沽十一元七角半、章華綿羊圖二十元零七角半、怡和五福圖二十一元五角、美發二十四元、協新二十五元、寅豐普通男色二十一元、頭號女色二十五元、元豐飛馬圖二十八元、英製品三十七八元、東貨三千號十九元、較之上週未均每碼又扒高半元以至一元光景、條子及素色、走銷均不弱、究其原因、（一）該派力司雖屬夏貨、而春末秋初之際銷路亦廣、（二）前月份所謠傳有大批到貨、目下事實證明祇到少數、（三）廠方定價始終高昂、且最近出品減少、照現市所售價格、尚多仍是背道而馳、</p>
<h3>臘綫蔴布廣銷</h3>
<p>之臘綫織成沖蔴膠布、邇來市銷頗為廣暢、西服幫大小各號、零躉莫不大有需要、南京幫添胃亦健、因其夏令暑天中、做西服材料中所最便宜也、以致頗為普及旺銷、客衣號衣制服、賡續大有指定需欲、昨公平·聯新牌子、廠方直接及大批發戶與掮客轉手、上下午共計成交百餘疋、米色價為二元三角、白色二元四角、灰色二元五角、米色需供兩旺、灰白顏色供求較缺、查廠方出產、刻多欲先交定貨、以致現貨市存見缺、行情比上前日尤呈堅挺、</p>
<h3>印煤堅持不跌</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、近月來久稀到貨、本市存底、雖甚充實、但貨中不願貶售、故當此淡銷時、猶能擯持、固非無因、現同業拆價、塊煤每噸四百三十元、下身煤悄三百七十五元、洋棧出貨、駁船外加、較上月反見堅挺、</p>

<h3>荷印談判破裂後　西報論日本步驟　如輕率南進必踏入陷阱　荷得英美援助決不屈服</h3>
<p>英文大美週報社評云、過去一周內、日本對荷屬東印度之威脅、顯係東施效顰之手段、但其技巧欠佳、情形又復不同、如輕率從事、勢將入於歷史上最危險之陷阱、可以斷言、</p>
<p>歧路徘徊　莫知所可</p>
<p>蓋日本之行為、顯屬抄襲希特勒之老文章、章圖脅迫弱小國家、服從其要求、此種方法、施於捷·奧·羅·保·諸國、雖有成效、但日方所未明暸者、即此法若不能發生效力、則必須繼之以武力、始可為所欲為、然日本目下尚無移師南向婆羅洲爪哇·及蘇門答臘之微象、然則其另一方法、惟有知難而退、但問題所在、為如何方可不失體面、</p>
<p>越荷情勢　今昔異殊</p>
<p>夫東京所以向荷蘭企圖恫嚇威脅者、乃因日本曾以同樣方法、對付法屬越南而獲得成功、殊不知荷蘭與法國之情形、根本不同、因法國原為歐洲列强之一、其殖民地遍及全世界、僅失去越南一地、尚小致發生極重大之影響、故維希方面認為與其作毫無勝利希望之戰爭、不如忍痛捨棄一隅、而保全其他各地、但荷蘭之情形、則大不同、如果一旦失去東印度、則荷蘭之地位、將與阿爾巴尼亞相等、故荷蘭必以全力保障之、而不惜以死相爭也、且荷屬東印度更獲有央美之援助、此則非越南所可相提並論也、</p>
<p>知難而退　殆所必然</p>
<p>今日荷蘭已堅決拒絕日本之要求、荷蘭有華盛頓與倫敦方面之援助、而東京則不能希望柏林與羅馬方面有效之幫助、東京之抉擇非武力即食言、就目下情形而論、日本殆將食言、而食言又為日本之傑作、如歸逛東半島與中國、取消二十一條、使中國屈膝、及不再與蔣介石將軍有所往來等等、均為日本食言之例證也、</p>
<h3>傳蘇聯商輪十二艘　將駛遠東　三艘已抵香港</h3>

<h3>全市各界一臻節電　電力消耗減少　兩租界均獲賀滿紀録</h3>
<p>本市兩租界電力公司、以歐戰益趨擴大、各交戰國家陸續徵用行駛遠東船舶之結果、致本市燃料來源、感覺恐慌、遂於本年初獲得兩租界當局之同意後、相繼實施節減電流、為求收獲實效起見、除一面規定凡超過用電限度者、一律六倍取費外、並實行廣泛宣傳、勸吿各業、一致節省無謂消耗、一般市民、以際此時艱、莫不願同舟共濟、故亦紛粉自動節電、據記者探悉、本年四月份電力消費、公共租界計為五六·二四二·〇〇〇瓩、內工業用電四四·八三八·〇〇〇瓩、商業用電六·〇九二·〇〇〇瓩、較之三月份、工業用電減少達二·〇五七·〇〇〇瓩、商業用電減少一·〇八一·〇〇〇瓩、至法租界四月份消費總電量為五·一〇〇·〇〇〇瓩、較三月份亦減少九一七·〇〇〇瓩、聞本市兩電力公司當局對此成續、尚表滿意、但仍望全市各界努力節制、俾獲更大效果、</p>
<h3>香港曼谷間運費　昨起增價　滬與曼谷遝費　尚未同樣措置</h3>
<p>英商輪隻、行駛上海香港仰光航綫、自廣州灣越南海防口岸、以戰事牽涉軍事關係停駛後、本埠怡和太古洋行均調撥船隻、改駛仰光航綫、至於滬港仰輪隻運費、兩月前一度增加百分之十五、五月二十五日由港運仰光運費、再增百分之三五、又傳香港太古公司多臣公司通吿稱、香港曼谷間一切運費、包括接駁運費在內、定於昨日起、增價約百分二十五、記者特詢睹此間太古公司、由滬聯運至香港曼谷兩地貨物、是否將同時增價、據稱上海公司方面代運至曼谷貨物、取道香港轉者、概例單報由香港太古公司總行辦理、此間猶未與滬總行取同樣措置、</p>

<p>得以持久</p>
<p>關於該委員會之基金、除過去未用罄之一千萬英鎊外、新基金為美貸華五千萬美元、英貸華五百萬鎊、及中國國家銀行貸與政府　千萬美元、所以基金甚為充實、外滙與幣信兩足維持、中外各業對於該委員會之設立、一致表示擁戴、</p>
<h3>工部局職員加薪　今日重議　各方希望推翻原案</h3>
<p>工部局職員普通加薪案、自經銓敘委員會議決提出、唯以全市各界人士認為工部局職員普遍之加薪、足以刺激物價之上漲、而使公衆生活負擔日趨加重、乃迫切呼籲、當工部局於上周三舉行兩周一次之例會時、一曾就銓敘委員會所提原案、予以討論、結果、議定暫為擱置、蓋職員薪給之增加、亦足使工部局財政情形難予調整籌措也、茲悉銓敘委員會以奉董事會之命、定於今日下午四時半召集會議、重行審查原提加薪一案、消息靈通人士、認為今日銓敘委員會之開會、當抱極客觀之態度、作最審慎之攷慮、其應注意之點有三、（一）工部局各級職員目前之基本薪給·生活津貼·及米貼之情形、（二）日前物價之一般狀況、有無步步上漲之趨勢、（三）其他各業之薪給及津貼、其水準於無超過工部局職員者根據以上三點、應決定依據目前客觀之情形、工部局職員究有無再行加薪之必要、惟一般市民均認為工部局職員之再度加薪、實無最合適之理由、為大衆幸福計、希望銓敘委員會能於今日開會推翻原案、按所傳銓敘委員會原提加薪辦法、為將職員生活津貼率自基本薪之百分之百五十增加百分之八十或兩百、又悉、二為增加日前職員純收入之四成、或先加兩成、而後視情形需要再加兩成、</p>

<h3>倪貽德的作品論</h3>
<p>— 肇桐</p>
<p>印象派的繪畫，雖然在色彩上起了一大革命，但結果他們自己的作品却成為色彩的游戲，而形成纖弱的，空虛的，唯美的表現。時會所趨，洋畫家之稍有所傾向者，到十有九個或多或少地受了印象派的影響。但是，在倪貽德氏的作品上，却絲毫也看不到一點這樣的面影，相反地，乃是屬於印象派以前，或是塞尚（Ceranne）以後。他的作風的特色，是巨人的造型感的表現，雄渾的寫實性的建立，在中國的新藝術上奠定了穩固不拔的基礎</p>
<p>從這樣的技法上的修養，他進而注意到題材Chirieo的問題上去。西洋的繪畫，自印象派以來，一直到一十世紀的現代，因為太注意到「怎樣表現，」反而把「表現什麼」的間題忘却了，因之陷於繪畫上德內容的空虛的缺點。蘇聯的社會主義的新寫實主義和最近法蘭西的超現實主義，便是這種傾向的有力的反動。從新寫實主義和超現實主義的思想出發，他搆思着一種民族主義的題材。</p>
<p>所謂「民族精神的表現」，這句話是非常空泛的。我們所需要的究竟是怎樣的民族精神呢。國畫上所表現的那種清高，風雅，瀟酒，出世等等的趣味，而為西方人十所稱道的中國的民族精神，難道是現代中國所需要的麼？中關的民族精神，自晉唐以後，因受了老莊的哲學的影響，尤其是佛學思想的流入，早己變了質了，這種變質的民族精神的表現，我們可以在太白的詩上，在雲林石濤的繪畫上，看出最顯者的例證。眞正的中國民族精神應當在秦漢以前，都是一種雄渾悲壯，慷概豪俠，具有現實性的「大俠魂」的精神，這種精神的最具體而顯明地表現在文藝作品上的，便是太史公的一部史記。把這種精神，給以造型化，現代化，恐怕是倪氏最近作品上所企圖的主題。</p>
<p>但藝術的作品和宣傳晝有着一種顯然的分野，耶宣傳畫的性質是說明的，分析的，臚列的，而藝術作品上的表現是象徵的，暗示的，綜合的，所以一幅含有內容的繪畫上，不必一定是一偭故事的陳述，一種思想的說明，它是一種渾然的不易捉摸的東西，我們不能去理解而祇能去感得。就如在倪氏近作「大漢」上所描寫的，不過是一匹馬，兩個大漢，一片黃土的背景而巳，但在這種我們可以意會到古詩人的「大漠孤烟直，黃河落日圓」的悲壯情緒，同時又可想像到現代中國靑年在中原塞外所負起的神聖使命「處女地」是代表了自由中國的富源的開發，「高原」上祇是畫着兩匹馬，但那馬，像是人格化了，具有一種堅定沉毅的性格，那形式是壯快而豪放的「懷古」一畫採取了超現實派的技法，表現出悠久偉大的古代中國的情調。</p>
<p>意大利的現代畫家契里珂（Theme）把古羅馬的追憶加以造型的現代化，倪氏的作品和契里珂有着相似之處，他是在企圖把古中國民族的偉大精神給以造型的現代化。</p>
<p>這樣的作品，已經超出了欣賞玩味以上，而是具有永恒性的紀念碑式的作品。</p>

<p>修學講座</p>
<h3>怎樣研究英文　（四）</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>這個辦法、初試的時候也許不慣、一兩次之後、就自然慣了、這樣作、至少有兩點好處、（一）可以知道作文的節段如何安排、（二）旣已抓住全文大意、則每句遇有生字、多少可以猜出幾分意思來、縱然查字典、也不至於茫茫然不知道究竟這字應當作何解釋、萬一把這字的釋義猜到六七分、倒是很夠興奮的、一、注意什麼　筆者的習慣、最喜歡注意一節中、最長句、最短句、或最不規則的句子、這個辦法雖不足為訓、但也很能引起研究的興味、但最要緊的、即注　與中文不同的結構、舉個例、</p>
<p>I　went　there　on　business.</p>
<p>譯出來即「我到那裹去有點事、」萬一這個句子是用的特殊構造、</p>
<p>Business　took　me　there.</p>
<p>這就得特別注意、因這種組織、我國文句中罕見、也許沒有、像這一類的造句在英文中、司空見慣、但教我們自己提起筆來、很難想到這一類的句法、英文中被動態Passive　voice的構造也用得很多、也是我們不大喜歡用的句法、因其如此、我們的文句多半是中國腔調、其次應當注意的是習語Idiom、譬如說、</p>
<p>She　has　left　her　home　for　good　and　all.這個句子大概有的人不大懂、假如我們把牠譯作「她離家是為的好及一切好、」那可成了笑話、這是由於我們不懂forgood應作「永遠」、and　all即altogether「全然」、所以不知道應解作「她從此拋別了家鄉」、</p>
<p>我們要想英文漂亮、非得多多的明瞭而準確的運用這些習語不可、</p>
<p>其次應當注重的乃有意義的單字、研究英文的人、一個好單字就是一個寳、這些寳就是我們的財產、這些寳可是都生着翅膀、一時雖說捉住了、一個不留神、就被牠飛走、要拴住牠、最好是常常用牠、</p>

<h3>美之哲學</h3>
<p>— 王一之</p>
<p>——上海人最大缺憾向推「行」與「住」——</p>
<p>國難當前，萬方同慨，物力之艱，引起精神煩惱，此豈上海一隅為然，抑且不限於中華一國。然而事在人為，境由心造，精神上善自解慰，多足以濟物質之窮。我有一言，善勸讀者，即謂「快樂健康與美麗，互為因果。「好美冰屬人類所可同享之天賦權能，人苟飢寒交迫，即不暇想及」「美」字，身人冷如冰窖之大禮拜堂，聽名師之樂奏，或竟退避恐後，無心細翫淸音之美。人至極疲倦時，亦不知寄情於美，勞苦如牛馬之與臺傭隸，事畢即昏睡，絕不感此生有何美趣。他如中國舊家庭積威高壓下之童養媳，暨受傳統極梏而不容發揚天性之一部分人家子女，外國前世紀工業萌芽時代米受法律監護之童工，暨彼機器未發明前傴僂一世之藝徒職役，大抵如半僵草木，望之者不能發生好感，女性犯之，甚且終生不易諧佳耦，近人詩云，「定會心事無人會，一管生花託病梅，」廖寥十四宇，寫盡人間斵喪自然美之隱痛。</p>
<p>又人身長矮不同，雖謂人種有東西之別，然吾觀歐洲北方家給人足之自由民族，所生子女，恒日進於健碩頎長，（謂非如貧兒之雖長甚瘦，）證以四千年歷史之中華民族，因缺乏精神愉快之發揚，並少戶外運動，而後代身材，漸見其短小者，正相反背。决則人類老衰之遲早，雖亦因種族而殊，然自民國以來，新家庭脫離妾媵之煩與姑媳之厄，每見旣婚之中年婦，視獨身之半老處女為易增美。至若留美肄業靑年容態之優美，則以新大陸學校村之利於接近大自然而勇於美化，或勤運動而發育體格，或習社交而和暢天機。其最淺易之運動，為多走長路，其最有益之社交，為勇於助人，此正貧國如中華，孤島如上海，盡人所能享受之最大樂利。</p>
<p>質直言之，美之為用實甚廣，近且顯者，樂在一時，而遠且深之幸福，則一生之舒慘擊之，人情孰不望其配偶與子女之日益加美。在上海為人，最大之缺憾，向推「行」與「住」，行則出門不得常履蔭道，樂遊之情味無多，住則在家無以廣拓庭國，兒童之氣質變劣。然世上一切發明事功與大多數驚人建樹，儘有發端於時之困迫，或一念之自利自私，而忽得意想所不及料之幸福與快樂者，吾人如欲勉盡人事以補天然之缺，則當此愁飢慮寒之歲，正宜注意快樂健康與美麗循環相因果之理由或者每日必須有一定之時刻，儘量接近美術音樂（如留聲唱片之屬）或心所美好之詩書文藝，以暫忘環境之人生。或則憑仗堅强意志，痛自戒勉，絕不以疾言厲色傷人，（允不欲以疾言厲色，加諸子女童稚之身，）賴以培養同伴同羣未歸淪喪之生態美。或更習勞多動，慎於飯食，淮而發抒自身之健康美。上海今為中國大城之一，又便於接近世界潮流，尚不至如困處僻壤窮鄉者因無外物為借鑑之自趨頹廢。誠不幸之幸也。</p>
<h3>黃梅時節談雨衣</h3>
<p>— 黃自强</p>
<p>時代無時無刻不在進步中，當我國還沒有發現雨衣的時候，大家都用雨傘以蔽雨，之後，歐美輸入一種雨衣，穿在身上，旣輕便，又舒服提起雨衣，由於質地之不同，因而分成種類甚多：</p>
<p>第一：橡膠質雨衣，此種雨衣亦有二類，一是純橡膠質，一是夾橡膠質，純橡膠質雨衣，在質地上，是比較厚而重，但是不堅固，且易破裂。夾橡膠質，污穢　不能洗淨，或洗後容易進水；同時，經過雨淋進水後漸漸加重雨衣東量，於身體上極不合衛生，尤其是冬天穿了太冷，夏犬穿了又覺太熱。</p>
<p>第二：防雨布雨衣，質地比較輕便，惟遇到大雨如注時或在雨中時久則無法防水；同時經三四次洗濯後，効力失盡，故不耐於穿；還有一個缺點是與橡膠質一樣，不宜冬夏。</p>
<p>第三，透明油綢雨衣，此種雨衣，因質薄而輕，穿着舒服，更固質輕飄動，隨時可以透空氣，使體溫得以蒸發，再則染上污迹，一揩即去，在冬季最宜着在大衣外面。</p>
<p>外貨進口，據海關報吿每年一千三百多萬元，近年來，尤其是日貨，進口數已占據了第一位，如第一種的夾橡膠質雨衣及第三種的油綢雨衣，市上差不多日貨居多，美國貨亦不少，質地互有差異，當推美國貨為最精良，但價格極昂，每件的須百餘元。</p>
<p>直到近二三年中，國產始亦有精美之油綢雨衣出產，據現在國產雨衣界公認，以美綸防水織物廠所產最為精夫，堪與美貨相媲美，而在價格上，則僅及美貨之半。</p>
<p>油綢透明雨衣的主要原料之一是絲，自淪陷區被統制後，上海即無法可以購得優良之絲料，因而使國產界蒙受出品上極大的影響，但美綸處此困難情形下，尚能設法補救不足，而產品還可以與美貨媲美，這實在是國產界的光輝。</p>

<h3>蝸居與螺域</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>長安居，大不易，海上寸金之地，較長安為允甚，飲啄偃息，侷促於一隅，幾至展卷無從，安研不得，況焚杳撫琴，說劍吹簫者。昔者亡友胡寄塵顏其寓曰蝸居，喻其窄隘，可謂切當。謝子閒鷗擅六法，以丹靑妙筆，寫螺域幻景，使人對之作會心之微笑，而益信海上生活之特殊化也。其螺域幻景，往往作於便面上，靑巒秀壑間，著數蝶大，不逾胡桃，其中緇流若干輩，磬鈛幡幢若干事，而貝葉蒲團，明燈佛龕，纖細無不悉備，以擴大鏡窺之，則面目宛然，神情畢肖，芥子須彌，即小見大，洵極詭誕變化之能事，非名手不克臻此也。然謝子以過耗目力與時日，不輕易作，茲印成珂羅版謝閒鷗畫集，由世界書局發行，人物仕女，山水佛像，均極神妙，而螺域幻景，尤足耐人玩賞，遊戲三味，開山藝苑，「語云造化入筆端，筆端奪造化，」謝子之技，誠有足多者矣。</p>
<h3>莫斯科街上的汽車</h3>
<p>— 溪農</p>
<p>我們早在上海看慣了汽車，可是完全從歐洲或新大陸裝載來的舶來品。但是現在莫斯科街上所見到的汽車，什九是蘇聯高爾基和莫斯科二廠自己製造成功的。</p>
<p>蘇聯在十年前，還沒有汽車工業；可是近幾年來的汽車工業，突飛猛進，發展很快。蘇聯的羣衆，已經有很大的力量，很好的造車技術；高爾基和莫斯科二大汽車廠的出品，還是不夠供給需用，儘量在擴充之中。</p>
<p>莫斯科街上的汽車，現在巳和世界各大城市一般，成隊的波濤似的穿過未開下去；裝貨汽車，以及大部份的乘人汽車，都是屬於國家公共機關的。其他工廠，報館，俱樂部，社會團體，都有服務汽車，辦公汽車；成千成百來來去去的工人，英氣勃勃的趕着他們的前程。</p>
<p>在資本主義下的工人，當然承認汽車是剝削者的專利品；自備的黑牌汽車，更是剝削者的符號。那麼在社會主義的首都莫斯科也許不會有自備的黑牌汽車吧？但是事　莫斯科的市民，也同樣有着自備汽車。這是蘇聯人民富足起來的表現，從蘇聯有了自己的汽車工業，纔開始有了自備汽車。記得六年前蘇聯政府有過一道命令；飛機師飛過三十萬基羅米突的距離以上，可以得到一輛汽車代步。近年莫斯利高爾基汽車工廠技術最優越的工人，都各得贈汽車一輛。可見莫斯科街上的自備汽車，乃是技術優越的工人美滿成續收穫；和吾們上海的自備黑牌汽車是大不相同的。</p>
<p>更正：上星期「西南的汽車夫」一文，頃得讀者來函，謂汽車夫應改為汽車司機員，文內之卡車夫亦應改為卡車司機員，用特更正如上。</p>

<h3>如此的二房東</h3>
<p>— 三房客</p>
<p>貪心無厭　不啻地癢蟲　極惡窮兇　賽過雌老虎</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>請您客許貴刊寳貴的一角，讓小市民發出一點微弱的呼聲。</p>
<p>龍盤虎踞　生財有道</p>
<p>二房東的心，我眞無法形容。當然，任何橷的人物，都是良莠不齊。可是，在下的這位一房東，可以說得起是「上海二房東」人格的代表。他做二房東，是在事變以前，租費極小，頂費也沒有，直到現在新加租後，三樓一底的房屋，不過一百二十餘元；除他目己住兩層外，三樓三個房間，二樓一個房間，差不多要收進租費三百元光景？地點在霞飛路呂班路口一處弄堂裹，一向也沒有空閒過，事變到現在，格外是利市三倍了。</p>
<p>他在一年之中，至少要加租四次以上，另外還有自來水，電燈費，房捐，甚至走路口的路燈，灶間用的條帶，倒水的漏斗，一切的一切，幾乎天天要向三房客呻手。事實上，自來水電燈費，至多也不過增加百分之幾十，他却要超過定價。</p>
<p>逢三添五　順水推舟</p>
<p>以去年一年而論，房租自來水費，巳加過四五次之多。今年一月裏，又加過一次房租，他的加租理由，是因為大房東加了他的租，名正言順，三房客的義務，是不容辭了。不料事隔三月，上月裹，二房東女主人，又發出加租的命令，她說：「大房東加租了，自來水又漲費了，下個月加房捐，還要加你們的房租。你們如不照加，就趕快搬塲。」我們幾家三房客聽了，並不懼怕她的雌威，祇覺得奇怪，為什麼一月裹大房東加租，現在大房東又加租呢？大房東加租，是一般的加租，絕不能在四個月之中，連加兩次。於是，大家分頭一打聽，原來二月裏加租，是二房東利欲心的驅使，這次加租，才是大房東所促成。</p>
<p>額外利潤　百之四九</p>
<p>不過，我們現在發覺他上次是詐欺，應當請他由上次所加的房租，退還我們，再由大房東加他租費之日起照加，這才算是一個合理的解決。可是，二房東不會和你講這種理的，並且比這種沒理由的事還多着呢。法租界自來水費，這次祇加了百分之二十六，報紙記載，誰人不知，他非要加白分之七十五，（照原來自來水費之基本數）這是什麼理由？只有他自己肚裏曉得，就是因自來水漲費，他自己本身用的水費，也要請你們三房各做個東道。電燈費，從前是聽他開賬，支配你用多少就是多少，現在，我們巳有一部份三房客自裝水表，這次她抄來的字碼，發覺不符上次的尾數，這不又是明明她在那裏弄的玄虛嗎？還有一句笑話，我們一房客不和他家打牌，也是加租的一個因素。</p>
<p>男在閫內　女出河東</p>
<p>世界之大，無奇不有，上海房東的奇事更多，我們這位二房東男主人朱先生，縮在房間裹不出來，（這不出來，是指不和三房客見面，因為他出來，還有自備汽車代步咧。）讓女主人出來，和我們作對。我們尊她一聲雌老虎，也不為過。因為她見三房客不肯加租，她會拒絕收取房租，同時，發出即要你們搬塲的怒吼！二房客不睬，更會和你吵鬧，聲勢洶洶，氣炎萬丈，要和你挑　，動武，停止供給自來水，剪斷電綫，更不人道的，當你在燒飯的時候，掀起塵土，落在你食物裹。口口聲聲，要打人，他：「女人打了男人，男人是不敢還手的。」她的目的，是因為公理上，法律上，不能和你們解決，便要在私下擾亂你們，侮辱你們，不惜以最卑鄙的手段，使得你們不能安居，除非加租而後止。</p>
<p>她不懂公　，她忘了公共衛生，公共秩序，她更不知有法律，祇知道用卑鄙的齷齪的手段，來爭取她小法的利益。</p>
<p>然而「他」呢？這位朱先生，永遠縮在房間裹不出來嗎？霞飛路上的一個一房客謹上</p>

<h3>也算「長衫階級」</h3>
<p>— 孫一帆</p>
<p>試問能不能穿了短衫上教室授課？這大概是從來沒有的吧！小朋友們都穿了長杉，雖然大多是破的，補的，難道做教員的就能不穿長衫？不能衣冠端正？立在講合上還像什麼呢？其實教員和苦力完全一樣，不過是「長衫」「短衫」的區別而已。</p>
<p>照理我們不能再穿長衫了，看啊！米煤，，日用品一天天的高長，薪金却依舊如故，恐怕身上的這件有了八個洞的長衫又要靠不主了，其實家裏的妻子早穿了短衫了（不是因為天熱），我也算「長杉階級」？整個的小學教員界呢？</p>
<p>「長衫階級」有面子無實際。</p>
<p>「先生，你的長衫破了！」</p>

<p>他重復在燈前的一條板櫈上坐了下去，趙四托人寫的那封信，又第七度被抽出來看着：東省殖邊銀行已倒了，三千多塊立還能希望收回半個子嗎？要是福華銀行也照樣來一個關門大吉，又該怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>窗子的隙縫裹猛可又吹進了一縷寒風來，使他不自覺地把腰間拴的那條布帶更收緊了些</p>
<p>「明天就動身趕去，不知道還來得及嗎？」他想事情既巳這樣嚴車，當然不能不去走一遭；可是當他的手指撫摩在自已的臉上時，兩條交叉的疤痕，捲起着像餃子的邊一樣的碎皮，以及那個中間缺了一小塊的鼻子，都使他氣餒得不敢再想到出門兩個字。</p>
<p>三四年來，因為他一直跟那些莊稼人在一起，他們旣漸漸把他這一副怪相看慣了，他那自慚形穢的心裹，不覺也一天一天的減淡了，現在忽然又要出門去，他眞不知道用什麼方法，才能鼓起自己的勇氣來。</p>
<p>他重復把趙四那封信塞進了襯衫上的一個口袋裹去，然後又整了整外面穿的那件藍布短棉襖，慢慢打板櫈上站起來。</p>
<p>「怎麼，孩子，你為什麼還不睡啊？」他回頭去向坑上一看，梅寳的眸子竟還沒有　上，滿臉透着一種孩子們所少有的憂鬱的神色。</p>
<p>「爸爸，今兒奶媽子說他們一家都要回去了…！。」</p>
<p>這倒又是一個出人意外的消息。</p>
<p>「沒有的事，孩子，這是她說着給你玩的。」</p>
<p>「不，爸爸，這是眞的！」梅寳儘管還是一個六歲的小孩子，但什麼是眞，什麼是假，已經也瞞不過她了。「哥哥和姐姐都……都這樣說。他們的爸爸，就是那個……那個王四，把衣服都放……放進……箱子去啦……！」</p>

<h3>America Trending Towards the Brink of War: Freezing German and Italian Assets in the US; Five Occupied European Countries Also Included; All Property Transfers Controlled by Treasury Department</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 15th: President Roosevelt yesterday completely froze the funds of Germany and Italy in the United States. The freeze also applies to previously un-frozen funds of European countries occupied by Germany in the United States, including Albania, Austria, Danzig, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. White House Secretary O'Leary stated before the official announcement of the freeze that President Roosevelt had already frozen the funds of fourteen other European countries. The funds frozen by the United States yesterday amount to no less than $4,500,000,000. It is widely believed that this move is intended to prevent Axis funds from further flowing elsewhere through neutral parties. It has been widely rumored that German funds have already escaped into Latin America. Government sources reported that the German and Italian funds in the United States are in the range of $300,000,000 to $400,000,000. Since the government issued the freeze order, the Treasury Department has obtained absolute control over German and Italian funds and properties in the United States, including cash, bank deposits, claims, stocks, bonds, mortgages, ships, goods, trademarks, contracts, or accountings, especially the latter, which is Germany's greatest interest. The White House also issued a statement when issuing the order, saying, "Once these measures are implemented, the transfer of all German and Italian property interests will be subject to government control. Anyone who does not comply with this order will be subject to severe criminal penalties." The statement also stated, "This order is intended to prevent foreign countries from using funds in the United States for matters harmful to US national defense and other American interests, and to prevent funds in the United States that have been violently seized in Europe from being withdrawn and used for activities detrimental to the United States. In addition to the funds of Germany and Italy being ordered frozen, five additional countries have also been included." At the same time, President Roosevelt, in addition to signing the freeze order, also approved the regulations for registering the property of foreigners in the United States. This registration regulation will apply to all countries, including those whose funds have been frozen. Authorities issued a statement stating that control of accounting freezes will not be applied to Finland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Soviet Union for the time being. However, the government hopes that the governments of the aforementioned countries can provide sufficient guarantees that their countries and their people will not use their ordinary accounting rights to undermine this order, and that any applications for fund transfers made by these countries based on ordinary accounting should be reported and carefully investigated by the authorities. According to previous freeze orders, those affected were only Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Greece.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th: According to the latest figures, the Axis assets in the United States that have been directly frozen are worth a total of $200 million.</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 15th: All Sunday newspapers carried the news of President Roosevelt's order to freeze Axis deposits in the United States on the front page with large headlines. The Sunday Express said, "The US Has Given Hitler a New Blow." The Sunday Express called President Roosevelt's actions "a prelude to war." The laying of mines in New York Harbor was also prominently featured in Sunday newspapers.</p>
<p>Italy Prepares to Retaliate Against the United States</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, 15th: The Italian government has issued an order to investigate and estimate American assets in the country. Informed sources said that this is a prelude to the Italian government's intention to retaliate against the US government's freezing of German and Italian funds.</p>
<p>International News Service, Washington, 15th: According to the Justice Department's opinion, after the last World War, Germans in the United States established a complex system to control certain American industries and obtain rich profits. This is why President Roosevelt froze Axis assets in the United States, its purpose is to deal with this role of the Germans. Today, Justice Department officials said that the president's strict order has put the United States in "economic war with the Axis powers." It is said that all German-owned patents, international patent agreements controlled by Germans, are also included, and most financial revenue instruments will be subject to strict control thereafter. It is also said that German investment profits and royalty income in the United States amount to $15 million per year. Now this income has also been cut off, and the German high command will no longer be able to obtain information on the secret development of the American military industry. This is the first time in twenty-three years.</p>
<h3>US Treasury Secretary Calls on the Nation to Prepare for War: Better to Die Standing Than Live on Our Knees</h3>
<p>Reuters, Amherst, Massachusetts, 15th: Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said yesterday at a dinner for the Amherst College alumni that if the American people are not prepared to fight to defend themselves, they cannot maintain their freedom. We must do something to eradicate the tyranny being carried out overseas, and temporarily risk losing our happiness or our lives. If we do not do so now, we will risk losing our freedom. Should we die standing, or live on our knees? It is up to us to decide.</p>
<h3>US Navy Department Announces: Mines Laid in New York Harbor; Training Nature, Not Real Defense</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Washington, 14th: According to an announcement by the Navy Department today, the entire sea surface in New York Bay, from Coney Island to the Sandy Hook Peninsula, a distance of 20 miles, will be laid with mines. It is reported that the shipping industry has been notified that the mine-laying date is approximately between June 15 and September 30, and the location of the water mines is roughly indicated. To prevent any eventuality, the mine-laying area will be constantly patrolled by the Navy.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th: The Army Department, which is responsible for laying the mines, stated that the mine-laying in New York Harbor is a training exercise, not a plan to defend the harbor. In the past, mine-laying has been done for training purposes. The Navy Department's disclosure only caused concern because of the tense international situation. It is said that laying mines is originally the duty of the Navy, but American rivers and ports are under the jurisdiction of the Army.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th: The US Navy Department yesterday disclosed its preparations to lay mines downstream in New York Harbor, which will be done this summer. It has not yet been stated whether it is only for training or for real defense. "The Washington Post" yesterday issued an inevitable demand for participation in the war, saying that if we are in a state of war, then we must act as if we are in a state of war, without concealment. Since Hitler has imposed his contempt for American policy on us, the time to resist Hitler has now arrived. Future actions must be taken by President Roosevelt, who has the title of marshal and is responsible for protecting American lives and property under the Constitution. At least he should instruct the Navy to search for and destroy Nazi submarines and privateers, who are wantonly harming American lives and property to diminish our maritime freedom. Hitler is now competing to control the Atlantic in order to embarrass the United Kingdom and seize control of the Western Hemisphere, but the President, in his fireside chat, has declared that the United States will actively resist any attempt by Hitler to seize maritime power. The Naval Hydrographic Office said that the sea line will extend from the mine-laying area to the Sandy Hook coast, and the mine-laying area will form a quadrilateral. Sandy Hook is two miles from the lighthouse and extends one thousand yards in one direction. This mine-laying area will be marked with four spherical buoys. Mines will be gradually placed from today until September 30, and the shipping industry should pay attention. After the armed mines are dropped, the area will be constantly patrolled. It is reported that last week the shipping industry received a warning from the Navy that it would conduct naval defense work in the ports of Los Angeles and San Diego. The Navy hinted that anti-submarine nets would be set up, but the official site did not comment on what work should be done.</p>
<h3>Welles Angrily Condemns Germany: Violates International Law; Germany Should Be Responsible for the Sinking of the American Ship; America Will Not Be Moved by Threats</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th: Undersecretary of State Welles yesterday told reporters about the torpedoing of the American ship "Robin Moor" in an emotional tone, saying that an American merchant ship engaged in peaceful commerce was tragically sunk in the Atlantic Ocean, and American citizens, including women and children, were forced to desperately board small lifeboats. This is greatly contrary to the provisions of international law, international ethical principles, and humanity. When reporters asked him to express the American attitude, Welles was unwilling to make a final statement without receiving a detailed report on the case. Welles discussed Berlin's threatening remarks that any ships carrying contraband to the United Kingdom must be sunk, saying that Americans are never moved by threats. This time, the "Robin Moor" was neither in a war zone nor carrying items prohibited by American law, yet it was sunk. Three-quarters of the crew and passengers died. As for the rumor that some of the rescued have arrived in Italy, the US ambassador to Italy has telegraphed to firmly deny this claim. Philip, the secretary of the US Embassy, who recently interrogated the crew of the "Robin Moor" in Pernambuco, has now gone to Para and will bring a detailed report and photos of the German submarine that sank the American ship, and fly to New York.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th: After the American ship "Robin Moor" was torpedoed and sunk, yesterday there was support in Congress for the State Department's protest or request to Germany. Some argued that American ships should be armed to resist submarine attacks or air raids. The Navy Department has been secretly preparing for the need for a large number of guns and cannons for several months, so that merchant ships can be armed when a decision is made. In addition to newly manufactured guns, the United States has stored a large number of usable guns since the last World War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the US Visits Welles: Content of Talks Not Disclosed</h3>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 15th: Undersecretary of State Welles met with Japanese Ambassador to the United States Admiral Nomura yesterday afternoon. Nomura said that his visit to the State Department was to express personal opinions and not to deliver any note from the Japanese government. However, Ambassador Nomura refused to disclose any specific content of his talks with Welles. Many observers believe that it may be related to the United States continuing to supply Japan with oil.</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Cables Italian Prime Minister: Reaffirms Loyalty to the Axis</h3>
<p>United Press International, Rome, 15th: It was officially announced that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka cabled Mussolini to congratulate Italy on its recent military victories and reaffirmed his confidence in the Axis powers' establishment of a new world order. This document was delivered by the Italian ambassador to Tokyo.</p>
<h3>Thailand Refutes: Japanese Rumors</h3>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 15th: Thai political circles have dismissed as absurd and malicious the reports in Japanese newspapers that Britain is trying to overthrow Thailand's current pro-Japanese cabinet. They said that the British authorities in Malaya have recently asked some Thai fugitives living in Louang, who have always opposed the current Thai regime, to move to a place further away from the Malayan-Thai border. It can be generally known that the British side has no intention of hostility towards the current Thai cabinet. It is reported that the Japanese newspapers have based their various rumors on the saying that five terrorists from Chongqing were arrested because they were involved in a plot to assassinate the Thai Prime Minister, but this has not been confirmed by responsible parties. Political circles here regret this attempt to create ill will between Britain and Thailand and between China and Thailand.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bangkok, 15th: Thai State Councilor Major Osananda told a Reuters reporter today that news from Tokyo listed his name with those of Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Thai political fugitives living in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, and said that he was plotting to overthrow the current Thai cabinet. He did not think it was worth criticizing, because this news was absurd and ridiculous.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Government Submits Supplementary Budget to Parliament: For Expenses of Implementing Compulsory Military Service</h3>
<p>Reuters, Batavia, 15th: The Dutch East Indies government has submitted a 1941 supplementary budget to Parliament, requesting continued approval of funds totaling 20 million Dutch guilders to begin implementing a limited local compulsory military service.

<h3>British Aid to China Society Prepares: Fourth Anniversary of China's War of Resistance; One Bowl of Rice Dinner Scheduled; Fundraising to Relieve Chinese Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th: The Aid to China Society is currently preparing a large-scale commemoration of China's four years of resistance and nation-building, striving for freedom. Hundreds of thousands of pamphlets titled "Four Years of Resistance and Nation-Building" are being prepared, detailing the special progress of China in developing its original strength during the war, and a one-bowl-of-rice dinner will be held on July 7 to raise funds to relieve the Chinese people affected by the war. Dr. Koo Vi-kyuin, the Chinese ambassador to Britain stationed in Lisbon, will chair this grand event. Commemorative meetings will also be held everywhere on the same day to make the British public understand the work that China has undertaken and is currently undertaking in the common struggle to liberate the world from Axis slavery. Lord Lisdowne, chairman of the Aid to China Society, published an article in the Manchester Guardian, raising funds to relieve war disasters in China and awakening the British people to the importance of China's war effort as one of the three pillars of world freedom. It also stated that in the past few months, hundreds of people have followed the actions initiated by the Aid to China Society, and hundreds of schoolchildren have written prize-winning essays. The Aid to China Society has assisted in organizing an industrial organization to link the work of British aid with Chinese industrial cooperatives.</p>

<h3>British Ship Sinks in the North Atlantic: All Crew Members Rescued</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th: The 46 crew members of the American cargo ship "Telesia" were rescued by the US Coast Guard cutter "Duane" in the North Atlantic, approximately 350 miles from Newfoundland. The Coast Guard authorities have just received a radio message from the "Duane" reporting the incident. It is said that they are currently carrying the rescued people to the port of St. John's, Newfoundland. The message included the phrase "Everyone is safe and sound, no one died." However, it did not mention what happened to the cargo ship. The "Telesia" was built in 1925, weighs 4,743 tons, and its registered port is London.</p>
<h3>Floating Mine Explodes in Singapore Harbor: Swedish Cargo Ship Damaged</h3>

<h3>A New Stage in US-German Relations</h3>
<p>The sinking of the Robin Moor has aroused very strong public opinion in the United States, and various retaliatory measures have been suggested, resembling the scene after the sinking of the Lusitania in 1915. However, the US government, even though its current position on the European war is far beyond the absolute neutrality of twenty-five years ago, has been very calm and cautious in this case. When the news first came, it tried to avoid being dominated by subjectivity and emotion, and calmly collected the facts about the sinking. So far, the facts have been clarified, not only confirming that the sinking of the Robin Moor was indeed done by a German submarine, but the German official statement on the 13th brazenly admitted this and even hinted that this type of unfortunate incident will continue to be replayed under the so-called reason of "contraband." If we compare the Nazi attitude towards the US at this time with the various explanations and guarantees made to the US in 1915, we can clearly see the seriousness of the current international situation, which is far beyond what could be compared when the Lusitania incident occurred.</p>
<p>On the eve of a war, there is usually a period of legal and moral debate, and the US and Germany are currently going through this process. The German side claimed that the sinking of the Robin Moor was because it was carrying "contraband," and that it was "contraband" because Britain had listed it as "contraband." Even if the claim is true, it can only be regarded as a very ridiculous reason, because the German side has no right to apply the British definition of "contraband" to American merchant ships and cargo. Although each country has its own different views on the so-called "contraband," according to the German explanation, it can indeed be proven that the ship was not carrying military supplies - and since neutrality has not been abolished, it is impossible for American ships to transport military supplies to Britain - moreover, the port of call, Cape Town, although a "British port," is not a war zone. To sink it near American territory is nothing more than a provocation against the US, and the anger of the Americans is naturally justified. The original international laws on naval warfare are almost ineffective in practical application. The Nazi authorities do not hesitate to easily tear up formal treaties that have been signed and are in effect, let alone international laws that lack binding force. Therefore, if the US protests to Germany, it will have no results, similar to this type of negotiation in history. In addition, the US has never recognized the Red Sea area as having been designated by Nazis as a war zone, and has begun to transport military supplies to the Near East. This is certainly another factor that could cause more disputes between the US and Germany.</p>
<p>In the past year, the hatred of the US for the Axis powers and its support for Britain have progressed in direct proportion to the tension in the European war. The German side knows this very well, so it stopped fantasizing about diplomatically easing the US long ago. On the other hand, its resentment towards the US is only vented through conspiracy and unbridled slander. As for actual hostile actions against the US, the Robin Moor incident can be regarded as the beginning. Of course, in order to contain US aid to Britain and participation in the war, Germany had already arranged for the third clause of the Tripartite Pact in the Pacific, but the objects it sought were not absolutely loyal to the alliance. And if the US were to go to war in the future because of responding to German provocations, the interpretation of the alliance's effectiveness would also require great effort. Hitler must also know these situations very well, so it is believable that Germany's sinking of the American ship was not intended to promote early US participation in the war, because that is not only not in the Axis's interest, but also the containment forces it has already deployed are unreliable. Its intention is probably not only to retaliate against the US for its deep disgust for totalitarianism and aggression, so as to avoid the loss of internal prestige caused by long-term forbearance, but also to launch an offensive targeting the weakness of the US's still immature war preparation and emotions, in order to contain Roosevelt's active steps in aiding Britain.</p>
<p>In recent days, although there have been some isolationist arguments and war-averse mentalities mixed in with the American sentiment, on the whole, there is only indignation and anger. The US Undersecretary of State's statement that Americans are not moved by threats is the best answer to Nazi atrocities. The first step the US authorities will take will probably be diplomatic means. The order to freeze all German and Italian funds in the US on the 14th, although unrelated to the sinking of the ship, can be considered a de facto response, and steps such as arming merchant ships and severely dealing with German submarines have long been in the works. Roosevelt's fireside chat a few days ago only mentioned guaranteeing the arrival of aid to Britain's war equipment and did not explicitly state what further means and methods would be adopted. If it is said that there are still some internal difficulties that have not been overcome, then this time Germany's piracy will undoubtedly help the US government eliminate some resistance, promote a sharper conflict between the US and Germany, and even engage in war. The sinking of a merchant ship, no matter how significant the repercussions, is not enough to constitute a reason for immediate participation in the war. Even in the last World War, participation in the war was implemented only after many American ships continued to be victims of unrestricted submarine warfare. But the impact of this incident on American society and even the psychology of the people may be more effective in deafening and awakening people than the loud calls of the American authorities, making Americans believe that at the very least they cannot help but engage in armed self-defense, and that war against the Nazis is finally unavoidable. Currently, Hitler's attention is focused on the Near East and northeastern Europe, but he will soon feel that the force from across the Atlantic is his greatest threat.</p>
<h3>27 Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing, US Military Attaché's Office Destroyed, USS Tutuila Slightly Damaged, Foreign Residences on the South Bank Hit, Large Fires Along the Riverfront, Southern Yunnan Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Chongqing - When Japanese bombers brutally bombed Chongqing today, the new office of the US Military Attaché and buildings constructed with US Red Cross funds were destroyed. A US gunboat and a US Navy bar also sustained minor damage. The newly appointed US Ambassador to China, Gauss, inspected the damage with embassy staff and noted that bombs fell within 100 yards of the US Embassy, an area known as a "safe zone" on the south bank of the Yangtze. (Fess, Associated Press Special Correspondent, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This afternoon, 27 Japanese planes raided here. The office of US Embassy Military Attaché Meyer was hit by a bomb, and several bombs landed within 75 yards of where the US gunboat Tutuila was docked. The ship was not damaged. Bombs rained down along the Yangtze River, mostly falling into the river and on the south bank near the US Embassy. The International Club took a direct hit, and half of the building was destroyed. Several foreign residences on the south bank were hit, causing large fires along the riverside avenue. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This afternoon, 27 Japanese planes carried out massacres and destruction in Chongqing's commercial and impoverished residential areas. Two special buildings built with funds from the American Red Cross under the "Housing Project" were also destroyed along with the homes in the impoverished residential area. At least four bombs fell within the "safe zone" on the south bank of the Yangtze River. These four bombs all exploded within 150 yards of the US gunboat Tutuila, but the ship only sustained minor damage. One bomb exploded within a few feet of the new office of the US Military Attaché. The US Military Attaché's office was located midway between where the Tutuila was docked and the US Embassy, and the Tutuila was less than 300 yards from the US Embassy. Thirty Chinese people standing at the entrance of a crudely built air raid shelter were killed. No foreigners were killed or injured. I stood on a small hilltop on the south bank and witnessed these 27 bombers, at 15,000 feet, arrayed in a line like slow-flying mosquitoes. Then the bombs fell, sounding like tearing paper, and the entire north bank opposite the US Embassy was filled with dust and smoke. The intense shaking caused us to step back. I and the other onlookers were standing about 1,000 yards away. The reporter then heard a huge explosion, turned and looked, and saw thick smoke erupting on the south bank of the Yangtze River, between the US Embassy and the Tutuila, with dust flying everywhere. The lower city of Chongqing was shrouded in smoke and dust. In addition to evidence of incendiary bombs, there were raging flames in the bombed areas. Several ships in the river were destroyed. Some of the boatmen on the bombed ships survived, while others were filled with corpses. Four bombs fell within a 150-yard radius of the Tutuila. Another bomb fell on the hillside near the new office of the US Military Attaché. The office was almost completely destroyed. The bomb exploded at the entrance of an air raid shelter, killing about 30 Chinese people. US Ambassador Gauss and embassy staff investigated the damage after the air raid alert was lifted. The windows of the US Embassy were shattered, and the plaster on the walls was loosened. The US Navy bar also suffered severe tremors, and the plaster on the walls was almost completely peeled off. The Tutuila suffered minor shrapnel damage, and some glass windows were shattered. The Italian Embassy also suffered minor damage. Anti-aircraft guns were quite active, but the bombers were flying very high, beyond their range. About 400 shops and houses were destroyed in the bustling areas of the city, including several public apartments built by the American Red Cross. Apart from the air raid shelters on the south bank, there were few deaths caused by the air raid. An estimated 40 people were taken to hospitals. It was reported that several air raid wardens were also killed, and there were several fires, but they were quickly extinguished. Shops on both ends of the bombed area resumed business within 15 minutes of the alert being lifted. After the bombers flew away, I inspected the destroyed office of the Military Attaché and then went down the river to inspect the Tutuila. The officers and men of the ship had already landed. A sailor said that a bomb that fell within 75 yards of the ship caused the stern of the ship to jump three feet. Another bomb landed on the shore, showering the ship with sand and gravel. A piece of shrapnel hit the ship, shattering windows and pottery, and damaging curtains. The only person injured was electrician Louis, who suffered a severe abrasion on his hand.

<h3>Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Launch Multi-pronged Attack on Huaian City, Both Buzha and Banzha Towns in Northern Huaihe Recovered, Chinese and Japanese Forces Confronting Each Other Under Huaian City</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Northern Jiangsu - Chinese troops southeast of Huaian in Northern Jiangsu launched a two-pronged attack on Huaian City on the evening of the 5th. One route bypassed and occupied Buzha Town and Banzha Town north of Huaian, cutting off the connection between Huaian and Huaiyin. The other route vigorously attacked Huaian, immediately occupying the new city and the walled city of Huaian. At noon on the 6th, Japanese troops in Huaian City, feeling isolated and without reinforcements, exited the west gate and retreated towards Huaiyin. They were ambushed by Chinese troops at Banzha, suffering heavy casualties and several destroyed vehicles. The Japanese then fled back to Huaian City and held it under siege. Currently, Chinese and Japanese forces are still confronting each other under Huaian City. (14th)</p>

<h3>Over a Hundred Japanese Warships Concentrated off the Coast of Zhejiang, Some Moving South, Aiming to Threaten India and the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to reliable sources received here, over a hundred Japanese warships are currently concentrated off the coast of Zhejiang Province, including transport ships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers. Some of them are moving south. Because the concentration of such a large number of warships is definitely not directed at China, people here believe that Japan will soon undertake a large-scale operation in the South Pacific, and that at the very least, Japan will again exert strong pressure on the Dutch East Indies, as negotiations between the two countries have apparently broken down. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Suffer Setbacks on the Border Between Hunan and Hubei</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Military news: (1) On the morning of the 11th, Japanese troops in Chongyang, Baini Bridge, Guishi, Dagouwei, and other places, totaling 2,000, invaded the area near Focen. Chinese troops intercepted and ambushed them along the way, and fierce fighting is currently underway. (2) Japanese troops invading the border between Hunan and Hubei suffered heavy losses after being intercepted by Chinese troops.

<h3>Sweden Lays Mines in Territorial Waters to Prevent Germany, Entire Garrison of Gotland Mobilized, German Transport Ships Have Sailed North</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Stockholm, Sweden, 15th - It was learned yesterday that due to the large-scale troop movements of Germany in Scandinavia, Sweden has laid mines in its sea to prevent accidents, and has mobilized troops on Gotland Island. A report from Norway stated that German troops have spread mines and set up other defenses on the Norwegian coast in the past few days, apparently preparing for military operations in the near future. It is reported that the German army has cut off the waterway traffic outside Stavanger and Igan Strait in Norway. From today onwards, all ships heading to and from Stavanger Island are prohibited. The German army has also confiscated countless Norwegian ships in the past few weeks, while intensifying control over land traffic in southern and northwestern Norway. In addition, 310 farmland in Kristiansand Island have been confiscated by the German army for the construction of airfields. A Swede from Gotland to Stockholm stated that German transport ships, each batch of 25 ships, sailed north on June 6th, 8th, and 9th. On June 12th, a large number of transport ships sailed south. These ships all sailed within Swedish territorial waters. Outside Kanius Island, several German warships telegraphed local officials in Gotland on the nights of June 6th and 7th, requesting to enter Weixinbei Port, but were refused. The next day, Swedish patrol ships found that mines had been laid in the sea outside the port. On June 6th, at least 32 German planes flew to southern Gotland. Afterwards, Soviet planes also frequently flew over. The mobilization of Gotland is almost complete. (The telephone line to Stockholm was cut off at this point in the report.)</p>
<h3>British Troops in Tobruk Gain Minor Victory</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 15th - Military officials here said that the British troops in the Tobruk area had gained a victory, which could strengthen the British defenses, but its importance should not be exaggerated, as it was only a local battle aimed at widening the positions of the British troops in the area. There are mobile battles in the western desert, and British troops have won several minor victories.</p>
<h3>Italian Planes Bomb Gibraltar for the Second Time</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 15th - The air raid on Gibraltar mentioned in yesterday's Italian military report was the first attack by the Italian Air Force on the British naval base this year. The first was on the 6th of this month. Military officials here believe that this move can be seen as a symbol of intensifying attacks on British bases in the eastern and western Mediterranean. Since the end of the Balkan War, after the German and Italian troops occupied Crete, the Axis air force can freely move in the central Mediterranean to attack British bases in the east and west. According to the "Lavolov Report" from Ahsiel, the military authorities in Gibraltar not only expected the area to be subjected to air raids from time to time, but also the possibility of paratroopers landing in the area in the near future. It is reported that the United Kingdom is now engaged in special air defense training, shooting balloons dropped from aircraft.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Heavy Troop Concentrations on the German-Soviet Border, German Troops Withdraw from Greece and Crete, Concentrating on the Romanian Border in Moldavia</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Istanbul, Turkey, 15th - A senior Turkish leader, after completing a Balkan inspection yesterday, confirmed that German troops had withdrawn from Greece, Crete, and Bulgaria. He also said that these troops are currently concentrated in Moldavia in Romania and other points in the Soviet border territories under German control. It is claimed in this regard that Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has also mobilized all Romanian reserve forces. This measure of Romania, with a large number of troops, has led to a shortage of labor and is also the cause of reduced food production and distribution.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 15th - The newly appointed Soviet Deputy Representative to Romania, Kogitikov, arrived here yesterday from Moscow. Soviet Ambassador to Rome, Laurentiev, will leave here and return to Moscow in the near future.</p>
<p>Havas, Bucharest, Romania, 15th - It has been rumored that the Soviet Minister to Romania, Lavrentiev, has been recalled to the country. Soviet officials here have solemnly denied this, saying that the current situation is extremely delicate, and Lavrentiev is well-versed and able to cope with it, and the Soviet government will not suddenly make any changes.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 15th - The mutual deployment of heavy troops on the Soviet-German border is regarded by many well-informed people in Turkey as a bluffing action to gain a better position in the negotiations. However, there are also some who hold a more serious view, believing that the Soviet Union is deeply disturbed by the current situation and has turned Bessarabia into a large military camp, placing mines and obstacles to prevent tanks from advancing on all roads leading to the border. Goring's statement that Germany needs Ukraine for a long-term war against Britain has not been forgotten by the Soviet Union. It is believed that Germany must have made demands on the Soviet Union for joint control of Ukraine and participation in Soviet industry, which Stalin would find very difficult to accept. It is said that half of it is to suppress the instability caused by food shortages, and half is related to Germany allowing Romania to return Bessarabia. It is said that General Antonescu has therefore obtained the cooperation of many Romanian leaders. It is believed that General Antonescu's recent trip to Berlin was for this matter. It is known that the reason for the food panic in Romania is partly due to the need to supply ample food to the huge German army stationed in Romania for military use. The Turkish leader also said that the new road for Romania to mobilize Slovakia towards the Soviet Union has now been built, and the order to prepare air raid shelters in Romania around June 15 has also been issued. Some people in Turkey have another view, believing that the German and Soviet troops on the border are the prelude to the establishment of a broad political and military agreement that will affect the Middle East. The possibility of the Soviet Union and Germany jointly establishing a new order in Europe is also expected. Although Turkish people have this different kind of concept, they all expect that there will be very important developments in the short term.</p>
<p>International News Agency, London, 15th - According to today's report in the Sunday Express, after a 40-hour meeting, Stalin and his military leaders have accepted the German request for close economic cooperation. According to the report, because military leaders told Stalin that the Soviet Union is currently unable to cope with Hitler's war machine, Stalin has decided to accept it. Negotiations are reportedly being held in Moscow to discuss the Soviet counter-proposals to Germany's demands. It is expected that a new agreement will be signed this week. Soviet officials deny that the Soviet-German situation is tense, and deny that Germany has made a request to the Soviet Union for further economic cooperation. The Sunday Express dismisses this as a political tactic.</p>
<h3>Hess Threatens Britain, If They Do Not Accept Peace Terms, They Will Conclude an Alliance with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>United Press of America, Glasgow, 15th - Glasgow Mayor Dowd Guan spoke at the Arms Week meeting last night. Nazi Party leader Hess had told British officials that if Britain did not accept the Axis peace terms, Germany would conclude a military alliance with the Soviet Union. Dowland said last week that Hess came to Britain with peace terms, hoping to return to Britain after discussing them with Scottish dignitaries.</p>
<h3>Croatia Joins the Axis Pact, Signs in Venice, Another Act of a Puppet Show</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - Swiss Radio said that the puppet state of Croatia is about to join the Axis alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan. This is probably one of the main reasons for the meeting between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Venice. The German Foreign Minister arrived in Venice last night. According to the German News Agency, the diplomatic authorities of Germany and Italy met last night. Kulin Bavaria, the head of Kroit, left Zagreb for Venice yesterday, accompanied by the Minister of Land and the Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Venice, 15th - The head of Croatia, Bavaria, signed a protocol here at the Doge's Palace this morning, announcing Croatia's participation in the Tripartite Pact. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Japanese Ambassador to Italy Hori, Hungarian Minister Tavilano, Romanian Minister Vukin, Bulgarian Minister Kardev, and Slovakian Minister Galfanak were all present.</p>
<h3>French Ships Sail Out of Toulon, Vichy Denies</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - According to Swiss Radio last night, the Vichy government has formally denied that the French fleet has sailed out of Toulon.</p>
<h3>Syrian French Troops Retreat, British Force on the Outskirts of Damascus, Roads and Bridges Are Destroyed, British Air Force Assists Warships</h3>
<p>Associated Press, London, 15th - According to sources yesterday, Syrian French troops have withdrawn from Kiswe and roads a few miles from Damascus. British troops have now occupied Nabata.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 15th - The latest reports from the Syrian battlefield say that the Allied forces are still advancing slowly in Syria because they sometimes encounter resistance and sometimes the roads are destroyed, preventing rapid advance. According to military officials, the Allied forces are very close to Saida. Apart from the above news, there is no information here about the current situation.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Cairo, 15th - Headquarters announced that the Allied forces are currently in contact with the Vichy forces on the entire Syrian front line, and the Allied forces in the central area have made new achievements yesterday.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th - The Free French Headquarters here received a telegram from Jerusalem stating that the Free French Army's entry into Damascus will be realized soon. Allied troops are stepping up their attack on Sidon, but at the same time minimizing casualties. Reuters asked the Cairo correspondent to report that the Allied forces entered Syria in five routes, making continuous progress and striving to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Currently, the British authorities have allowed merchants from Lebanon and Syria to enter Palestine and purchase gasoline in various places, and especially allow them to transport wheat, flour, white sugar, coffee, and kerosene to the areas occupied by the Allied forces in Syria. According to the Beirut Vichy News Agency, Syrian French Affairs Officer Dunz issued an order instructing all officials not to leave their posts unless ordered by their superiors. Currently, gendarmes and police patrol the streets of Damascus and Beirut at night to prevent disturbances. At the same time, civilians continue to evacuate, and a large number have left the country. Announcements have been issued in Damascus and Beirut, urging residents to remain calm.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 15th - According to news from Jerusalem, a military spokesman there stated that after the Allied forces occupied Mgarong, they divided their troops into two routes, one to the northwest and one to the northeast, continuing to advance. The pressure around Damascus is currently intensifying. According to a correspondent traveling with the army, there was no resistance in Mgarong. The British army's advance was only hampered by the retreating Vichy troops blowing up the bridges. Residents seemed very welcoming to the Allied forces' entry.</p>
<p>Havas World News Agency, Vichy, 14th - Military observers here recently stated that it has been seven days since the British troops and the de Gaulle troops invaded the two states of Syria and Lebanon. Although they have continuously launched fierce attacks on our army's positions in various places, the important cities are still in our army's hands. The enemy troops who crossed the Oran Plain and attacked the city of Damascus were blocked by our army outside the city of Qisu and are currently 12 miles away from the city of Damascus. As for the enemy troops attacking the city of Beirut, they are Australian Commonwealth troops who attacked our army's positions under the cover of the British fleet. Although they once broke into the city of Sidon, they have been repelled and are 30 miles away from the city of Beirut. However, the British navy has strong strength, and there will be some developments in the next few days. However, in any case, the operational plan decided by the British government has been hit.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Beirut, 15th - A French military report stated that the joint attack on the city of Sidon by the British infantry and tank army has been repelled by the French army. Although the British navy bombarded fiercely, the French army still defended its position. French planes bombed the British tank convoys south of Sidon and directly hit them. A British twin-engine plane was shot down. The French air force and navy cooperated very closely. The city of Beirut is calm. There is a possibility that it may be occupied by the Allied forces. Only a quarter of the people in the city have evacuated. Syrian Administrative Officer Dunz ordered all gendarmes and police to remain in place.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 15th - A British Air Force bulletin in the Middle East stated that the British and Australian air forces continued to provide air support to the Allied forces in Syria and to British ships patrolling the Syrian coast.</p>
<h3>England and France Exchange Documents Regarding Syria; France Expresses Extreme Indignation at British Actions</h3>
<p>Havas World Telegraph Agency, Vichy, 14th: The documents exchanged between England and France regarding the Syrian affair have been made public. The French Information Agency has also issued a statement commenting on them, stating that the British note declared that if the French government itself took or allowed others to take any action that infringed upon British interests, then Britain would take aggressive action in response. The British side, based on rumors spread by some newspapers and radio stations, namely the so-called rumors that the enemy had infiltrated Syria, believed that it had the right to attack Syria. This kind of action, which is purely premised on its own interests, disregards the plight of the local people, and arbitrarily expands the war, is something that no country can tolerate. Moreover, when Britain launched the invasion, it also admitted that there were no German or Italian elements in Syria, which shows that its actions are even more unreasonable. The British government also requested that General Pétain instruct the French garrison in Syria not to resist British military actions. The French government is very indignant at this proposal and has resolutely rejected it. The French army has a responsibility to defend the territory in Syria, and no one can ask it to abandon its duties. If the British government really intends to end the bloodshed, it should immediately admit that the claim that German troops have entered Syria is a misunderstanding and resolutely withdraw its troops. In short, the solution to the problem still requires the British to resolve it themselves.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vichy, 15th: The Vichy News Agency stated that the British side recently sent a note to the French government proposing that a ceasefire by the French forces in Syria would be beneficial to both countries. The French government has rejected this proposal. The British note stated that the Vichy government should order its troops stationed in Syria not to resist the measures taken by the Allied forces to prevent the German side from using Syria as a base of operations.</p>
<h3>Turkey Still Suspicious and Fearful of Germany; Vigilance Remains Unrelenting</h3>
<p>Reuters, Ankara, 15th: The Turkish News Agency's Berlin correspondent reported that Germany has assured Turkey that it need not fear the Axis powers. People have different opinions on this statement. Turkey is certainly happy to hear that Germany has no malice towards Turkey and supports Turkey's policies, but it is deeply disturbed by Germany's repeated declarations of its intentions, so they are speculating whether this is a prelude to Germany making economic demands, or part of the intimidation tactics against the Soviet Union. If a conflict occurs between the Soviet Union and Germany, Turkey's position has been guaranteed by the recent Soviet-Turkish mutual guarantee agreement, which has consolidated the previously established non-aggression pact. Germany is well aware of this, but some people say that Germany sincerely declared German-Turkish friendship in order to improve its position vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. At the same time, Turkey is still carrying out its defense preparations without the slightest懈怠.</p>
<h3>Red Army Exercises in Moscow and Kyiv</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th: Swiss Radio reported that the Soviet Union is currently conducting extensive exercises, such as parachute and tank drills. The exercise locations are in the Moscow area and the Kyiv region.</p>
<h3>Report of Tegol's Injury Proved Inaccurate; The Injured Person Was Someone Else</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 15th: According to a correction from the Free French News Agency in Damascus, the person injured by the bombing by an aircraft bearing the tricolor flag was General Rigan-Tierholm of the Free French Army. The report that the leader of the Free French Army, Tegol, was injured is inaccurate. Ri is currently leading the Free French Army forward in Syria. He formerly served as the Governor of Djibouti and was one of the earliest French generals to publicly oppose the armistice with Germany. Ri is young and well-known in East Africa.</p>
<h3>British Navy Sinks German Supply Ship</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 14th: According to the Admiralty, a supply ship for the German battleship Bismarck has been sunk by the British Navy. This is the sixth German supply ship sunk recently. In addition, another armed fishing boat was sunk. It was also announced that British submarines in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas recently sank eight Axis ships and severely damaged two others. The attack locations included not only the sea but also Axis ports. An Italian convoy, including one fast ship and one armed fishing boat, was sunk by British submarines using artillery fire. Another submarine torpedoed and sank an 8,000-ton transport ship. The Italian oil tanker Sianbo, 5,232 tons, is said to have arrived at Istanbul with severe damage from a British submarine torpedo. Another submarine sank a fully loaded 1,000-ton supply ship in the Italian port of Randusa Island.</p>
<h3>Spanish Army and Air Force Hold Exercises</h3>

<h3>On the Special Reserve for Industrial and Commercial Deposits</h3>
<p>— Wang Wennan</p>
<p>In recent years, one of the main reasons why general industrial and commercial enterprises have been able to obtain huge profits is nothing more than the currency value fluctuations and the surge in inventory prices. Therefore, at the end of each year's final accounts, astonishing profits can be concluded on the books, but in reality, most of them are virtual values on the books, not real wealth. When prices return to normal in the future, general industrial and commercial enterprises will inevitably suffer losses from falling inventory prices because they must maintain a regular amount of inventory to meet their operational needs. Will the so-called surplus today not still be equal to zero in the future? If, today, this type of surplus from rising inventory prices is still distributed as dividends according to normal methods, once prices fall, losses will inevitably occur, and the dividends that have already been distributed cannot be recovered. The impact will inevitably involve the business itself. Although the company has regulations to withdraw one-tenth of the surplus as a public reserve fund, the amount is limited and not sufficient to meet the needs of future compensation. Therefore, in order to maintain industrial and commercial industries and prepare for future revival, the government has specially formulated the "Methods for Special Reserves for Industrial and Commercial Deposits in Extraordinary Times," which are divided into eight items. They have been approved by the Executive Yuan and announced and implemented on April 14 of this year. All general public organizations must abide by and implement them from this year onwards. I will now express my humble views on the content of the measures as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Special Reserve Withdrawal Methods According to the provisions of Article 2 of the Special Reserve Methods, when industrial and commercial enterprises organized as companies have a surplus at the end of each business year, in addition to the provisions for withdrawing public reserve funds in accordance with laws and regulations, they shall withdraw special reserves in accordance with the following provisions.</p>
<p>1. If the surplus exceeds one-fifth of the total paid-up capital, withdraw 10% of the surplus.</p>
<p>2. If the surplus exceeds one-fourth of the total paid-up capital, withdraw 20% of the surplus.</p>
<p>3. If the surplus exceeds one-third of the total paid-up capital, withdraw 30% of the surplus.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the so-called industrial and commercial enterprises organized as companies refer to companies that have been registered with the government and approved for establishment. They must all abide by the various provisions of these methods. Suppose a certain limited liability company has a total paid-up capital of 100,000 yuan. The operating results for this year show a surplus of 21,000 yuan, which exceeds one-fifth of the total capital. According to the provisions of the first item above, in addition to the legal public reserve of 2,100 yuan, a special reserve of 10%, or 2,100 yuan, must also be withdrawn. From the above example, it can be seen that if the annual surplus of a general company-organized enterprise exceeds 20% of the total paid-up capital, it must withdraw a special reserve in addition to the legal public reserve to prevent future price fluctuations and use it to compensate for unexpected losses.</p>
<p>(2) Special Funds for Storage and Periodic Reporting This special reserve is stipulated to be stored in banks in special funds so that the authorities can check it at any time. We must withdraw the full amount. At the same time, it is stipulated that one month after the end of each business year, the business report, balance sheet, property catalog, and profit and loss statement should be submitted to the competent authorities and reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. However, the Shanghai municipal administrative authorities are temporarily closed. Before they are restored to their original state, industrial and commercial enterprises in this city may directly report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to speed up the process.</p>
<p>(3) Provisions for Taxation and Use The special reserve is stipulated to not be exempt from tax. Therefore, when general company-organized enterprises pay the profit tax and excess profit tax, this reserve should still be included in the calculation of the tax payable and not deducted to avoid affecting government tax revenue. For its use, it is stipulated that it may not be arbitrarily distributed without the approval of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, except for compensating for unexpected losses.</p>
<p>(4) Penalties for Violating Various Regulations Anyone who violates the various provisions of these methods, fails to withdraw the special reserve in full, or makes false reports, may, after investigation, be fined up to 1,000 yuan for the company's practicing shareholders, promoters, directors, and supervisors in accordance with the provisions of Article 232 of the Company Law.</p>
<p>The purpose of the government in formulating these methods is entirely for the benefit of industrial and commercial enterprises themselves, deeply instructing all industries not to be deceived by the current abnormal prosperity and to slightly consolidate the foundation of the business. For the sake of preparing for a rainy day, sufficient reserves should be withdrawn to be used as compensation for unexpected losses when prices fall in the future. This shows the government's far-sightedness. It is hoped that industrial and commercial enterprises organized as companies will understand the government's intention to maintain them, lead all industries to strictly comply, and that it is of utmost importance to prepare for the revival of industry.</p>
<h3>Soviet Foreign Trade Organizations</h3>
<p>Although cargo ships on the Pacific Ocean are still very busy, the Shanghai market, which is supported by imported goods, is already worried about the day when these cargo ships stop coming to Shanghai. Everyone holds a contradictory emotion: that is, without the United States joining the war, world peace will not be easily restored. However, if the United States joins the war, Shanghai's life will not be easy. At that time, there will be too many and too serious reasons why life will not be easy. The interruption of imported goods is also very distressing.</p>
<p>Even so, everyone is not without self-consolation. Everyone believes in the local saying that "the boat will naturally go straight when it reaches the bridge," and some people are concretely conceiving that the Soviet Union may be the supporter of Shanghai's situation at that time. Although the Soviet Union may not be willing to carry this wet wood, and the Soviet Union will sooner or later be drawn into the whirlpool. More importantly, where does Stalin's heart lie, on the right side? Or leaning to the left? If it leans to the right, Shanghai will be finished anyway. But no matter what, Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles seem to be waiting for the arrival of Soviet products. And Soviet products also seem to intend to reach this big market in the Far East. Recently, Soviet merchants and brokers close to Soviet merchants in Shanghai have been very active. This is a completely new attitude. The Soviet-Chinese Trade Company has already opened, but it is in Hongkou, which is desirable but unattainable. It is said that there is also a more powerful Lianhua Foreign Company in preparation, located in the French Concession, surrounded by broker organizations such as Lihua Trading Company and Sida Foreign Company.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union's foreign trade is state-owned and planned. His plan is completely based on his own principles, and the needs of foreign markets are not in his plan. Therefore, what Shanghai needs may not be what he has, and what he can supply may not be what Shanghai wants. Also, because his exports were originally the discharge of excess domestic production, he neither pays attention to packaging nor standardizes the weight units of the packaging. When commercial disputes arise due to non-compliance with delivery standards, one party to the dispute is a merchant, and the other party is a Soviet government agency. The arbitration and the effect of the arbitration both raise questions. Therefore, although Soviet merchants in Shanghai are currently very active, steady friends are still hesitant.</p>
<p>In addition to these practical problems, what makes people more difficult is the fundamental lack of understanding of the Soviet trade system. Everyone has long known that it is state-owned, but they do not know how it is state-owned? And the above-mentioned so-called practical problems actually arise from a fundamental lack of understanding.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's foreign trade is under the highest authority of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade. It was not until 1930 that it separated from the People's Commissariat for Domestic Trade and operated independently. The reason why it separated from domestic trade was actually the beginning of attention to international competition. The main functions of the department are four: (1) establishing trade policies; (2) implementing the above policies; (3) handling tariff affairs; (4) organizing foreign trade management agencies. Therefore, various specialized agencies are set up within the department. The main ones include the State Administration Bureau, the Planning Bureau, the Trade Policy Bureau, the Taxation Bureau, the Export Bureau, the Import Bureau, the Exchange Bureau, the Foreign Trade Loss Prevention Bureau, the Rationalization Bureau, and the National Supervision Bureau for Export Commodity Quality. As of June 1940, the Chairman of the People's Committee for Foreign Trade was Mikoyan, the Vice-Chairman was Kaurchikov, and the Trade People's Commissar was Stepanov, among others. The department has commissioners in each federal autonomous republic, and in foreign countries, it represents the department in the name of "Trade Representative Office" to perform supervisory and command duties. This "Commercial Representative Office" can be said to be a branch of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Trade, and it can also serve as a type of Soviet diplomatic agency, performing the functions of negotiating and signing commercial treaties. Therefore, it is composed of two parts. One part is dedicated to general affairs and is responsible for supervising the other part and other relevant agencies. The other part is dedicated to the actual business of import and export. The Soviet Union currently has commercial representative offices in:</p>
<p>London, England; Vienna, Austria; Berlin, Germany; Copenhagen, Denmark; Salerno, Italy; Warsaw, Poland; Istanbul, Turkey; Stockholm, Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Tehran, Persia; Athens, Greece; Mai Mai Cheng, Outer Mongolia; Paris, France; Tokyo, Japan</p>
<p>In addition, there are specialized trading companies in England, the United States, and Argentina; for trade with the Far East, there are also special trade agencies. At the same time, various specialized agencies are established according to commodity categories. Below, we will list the names of the commodities that each agency is responsible for managing, but the names of the agencies are too long, so they are indicated by numbers.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market News and Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Mr. Zhang Yifan, Recorded by Feng Zhida</p>
<p>—Commercial News Textbook for the Business School of Shanghai University—</p>
<p>The world's cotton production is about 100 million dan or more per year. The United States produces the most, followed by India, and China ranks third with an annual production of more than 10 million dan.</p>
<p>Cotton Producing Areas: China has a very wide cotton producing area, including the six provinces of Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Longdong in the Yellow River basin, and the seven provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan in the Yangtze River basin. Other provinces in the southwest, such as Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Guizhou, are also flourishing. In addition, textile workers account for the largest number of workers in the country. From this, it can be seen that the rise and fall of the cotton industry is of great importance to our entire national economy.</p>
<p>Quality: The quality of cotton, in addition to being clean, dry, and free of water and ramie adulteration, is determined by the length, width, twist, and strength of its fibers. Long fibers can be spun into fine yarn, and vice versa. The standard for fiber length for ordinary spinning is:</p>
<p>The cotton produced in our country can be roughly divided into two types: one is "native cotton" and the other is "improved cotton," such as "American cotton." Native cotton is only suitable for spinning 12 to 16 count yarns; improved cotton, such as the American cotton of Shandong, especially "Lingbao cotton" (Henan), is the best, because its fibers average over one inch in length and can be spun into fine yarns of 20 to 32 counts or more. Higher count yarns are finer yarns, and vice versa are coarser yarns. Generally speaking, most domestic cotton can be spun into 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>The length of the fiber depends on the use of spinning and weaving, and it is most important that the length is uniform. Long fibers are soft, and vice versa are stiff. Warp yarns should use stiff raw yarns, and weft yarns should be soft. The so-called twist and strength refer to the degree of twisting of the fiber per inch. High twist fibers are strong and tough, and vice versa are loose and soft. Sea island cotton has a twist of 240 degrees per inch, Egyptian cotton has 180 degrees, Brazilian cotton has 140 degrees, Indian cotton has 120 degrees, and domestic cotton is roughly similar to Indian cotton.</p>
<p>Grades: To facilitate cotton transactions, exchanges rate various cottons according to their grades. In our country, the standard is domestic fine-staple cotton that can be spun into 20-count yarn. The first grade can be used as raw material for 32-count yarn, including Lingbao cotton, Luoyang cotton, Tianjin American cotton, and Shandong American cotton. The second grade is the standard grade, such as Tianjin fine-staple, Shandong fine-staple, Changyin fine-staple, Shashi and Hankou high-grade fine-staple, Tongzhou fine-staple, and Dongtai fine-staple. The third grade is raw material for 16-count yarn, such as Hankou, Shashi, and other fine-staple cottons, as well as cotton produced in Shanghai, Taicang, and other places. The fourth grade is raw material for 10-count or lower yarns, such as Yuyao, Shandong, Hankou, Tianjin, and other coarse staple cottons. Each grade is further divided into four classes: A, B, C, and D. In the past, our country's standard cotton was based on cotton that could be spun into 16-count yarn. Before the war, it was changed to 20-count yarn, which is a manifestation of the progress of our textile technology and the improvement of cotton quality. However, cotton quality improvement is still relatively backward. Therefore, although domestic cotton production is large, raw materials for fine yarns still need to be imported from abroad, and domestic cotton is exported to offset international payments.</p>
<p>American cotton is divided into nine grades on the New York Exchange, namely: (1) Middling fair (2) Strict good Middling (3) Good Middling (4) Strict Middling. The above are all upper grades. The fifth is Middling, which is the standard grade. The term "Middling" reported in the news refers to this. The next are (6) Strict low Middling (7) low Middling (8) Strict good ordinary (9) Goodordinary.</p>
<p>Indian cotton is divided into seven grades on the Bombay Exchange, namely: (1) Extra Superfine (2) Super fine (3) Strict fine. The fourth grade is fine, which is the standard grade. Below that are (5) wall up fine (6) Barely fine (7) fullygood. However, when Indian cotton is traded in Shanghai, it is classified by place of origin, namely Broaca, Gmra, and Brengal. Broaca and Brengal are the fourth-grade standard cottons, 7/8 inch and 5/8 inch long, respectively. They can be spun into 26 to 28 count yarns. Gmra is raw material for 20-count yarn.</p>
<p>Transactions: Before the war, cotton transactions in Shanghai were divided into two types: spot and futures. Trading unit: On the exchange market, the spot is 50 Sima dan, and the futures are 100 Sima dan. The market price is calculated in national currency yuan per dan, and the bid unit is five cents. Futures have a term of one to six months. Now they are all spot transactions. Foreign cotton is traded in term futures with foreign firms. The price is still calculated in Sima dan, and the transaction is calculated in bales. Each bale has a different weight, as follows:</p>
<p>Indian cotton (general) 400 lbs Brazilian cotton 400 lbs</p>
<p>(Southern) 500 lbs Egyptian cotton 730 lbs</p>
<p>Burmese cotton 400 lbs African cotton 400 lbs</p>
<p>American cotton 500 lbs</p>
<p>Domestic cotton packaging is divided into five types: iron rolls, large bales, medium bales, small bales, and burlap sacks. Iron rolls are wrapped in cloth and tied with iron sheets, weighing about 410 catties. Large bales weigh about 180 catties, medium bales weigh about 125 catties, and small bales weigh about 60 catties.</p>
<p>Futures traded on the New York Exchange are limited to twelve months, and the transactions in January, March, May, July, October, and November of each year are the most active. The trading unit is 100 bales, each weighing 500 pounds. The market bid unit is US cents per pound of American cotton. Therefore, the formula for the legal currency price is:</p>
<p>The trading unit on the Bombay market is 100 bales, each weighing 400 pounds. The trading unit is one Candy (weighing 784 pounds), and the bid unit is one Candy in Rupees. Therefore, the formula for the legal currency price of Indian cotton is:</p>
<p>The trading hours of the New York Cotton Exchange are from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm. The Bombay market is open from 11:30 am to 3:30 pm.</p>
<p>"Postscript" This note has been revised and supplemented by Mr. Zhang.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>American Cotton Continues to Rise, Indian Cotton Also Rises</h3>
<p>The New York cotton market rose due to purchases by the New Orleans region and large-scale consumption. As a result, the closing price rose by 6 to 9 points compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to good flax market conditions, then fell slightly due to profit-taking by bulls, and then rose again due to purchases by futures traders. As a result, the closing price rose by 1.25 to 7.25 compared to the previous day. The forecast price has not yet been reached.</p>
<p>Also, according to the statistics of Indian cotton from September 1st of last year to June 14th of this year (per bale of 400 pounds):</p>
<p>Total listed in Bombay: 2,732,000 bales</p>
<p>Also, still in stock: 1,483,000 bales</p>
<p>Total listed in Karachi: 1,176,000 bales</p>
<p>Also, exports: 1,104,000 bales</p>
<p>Also, still in stock: 300,000 bales</p>
<h3>Orchid Seed High-Priced Goods Look Promising</h3>
<p>The arrival of orchid seeds has been scarce recently. The market inventory is only a few dozen pieces. However, at the same time, the needs of various gangs are also weak. Therefore, the market situation is not very prosperous. The inventory of high-priced goods has been exhausted, and the firm's hand goods are also scarce. Therefore, the market outlook is promising.</p>
<h3>Hardware Spot Shortage, Market Booming</h3>
<p>Recently, the hardware market has been affected by the closure of overseas sources and the extremely thin inventory of this street. Therefore, the circulating goods are increasingly scarce. The standard prices of various goods are booming. The minds of the industry are also invigorated. The entire market feels like there is a market but no goods. However, actual transactions have not been lively. The recent overview of various goods is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tinplate: American tinplate of sizes 24 and 26 has been out of stock for a long time. Currently, only a certain hardware store on North Suzhou Road can supply the market with a small number of spot transactions. The other inventories are even more negligible and cannot affect the market. It is found that the only destination for this product is drum makers, lock factories, and machine factories. Outer port orders have recently been cut off. The market atmosphere is very high due to the thinness of circulating goods. People's hearts are also holding firm on the sales offer. Yesterday, the price of size 24 goods was estimated at 1,200 yuan per box, and the price of size 26 was shouted at 950 yuan per box.</p>
<p>Ribbed Steel Bars: Ribbed steel bar transactions are weak because the construction gangs on this street have not extended their orders, and transactions with outer port merchants are also negligible. However, because overseas sources are not continuing, relying only on the inventory in this city is limited after all. The industry has seen this phenomenon. Although its sales are stagnant, the market is still holding firm. Yesterday's market price, such as 3-4 point sizes, required 3,300 yuan per ton, and 5-point to 1-inch goods were also sold for 3,250 yuan. Compared to the previous market, the dark market trend is very firm.</p>
<p>Black Steel Billets: Recently, the market has been showing extraordinary vigor due to the urgent search in the market. The market price has risen by as much as 100 yuan per day. Billet factories, printing factories, thermos factories, and machine factories on this street are taking advantage of the opportunity to bid. In the thin spot market, the search has become even scarcer, causing the market price to rise again. Currently, 2,000-pound old steel factory goods are priced at 3,700 yuan per bundle, and new steel goods are also sold for 3,600 yuan, which is another 100 yuan increase compared to before.</p>
<h3>Palaisse Cloth Rises Again</h3>
<p>Palaisse cloth has rebounded again. Hongsheng goods are wholesaling for 11 yuan and 75 cents per yard, Zhanghua cotton sheep pattern for 20 yuan and 7 and a half cents, Ewo five blessings pattern for 21 yuan and 50 cents, Meifa for 24 yuan, Xiexin for 25 yuan, Yinfeng ordinary men's color for 21 yuan, first-class women's color for 25 yuan, Yuanfeng flying horse pattern for 28 yuan, British products for 37-38 yuan, and Dong goods No. 3000 for 19 yuan, which is an increase of half a yuan to one yuan per yard compared to last weekend. Striped and plain colors are selling well. The reasons are: (1) Although Palaisse cloth is a summer product, it also sells well in late spring and early autumn. (2) The rumors of large shipments arriving in previous months have now been proven to be only a few. (3) The factory price has always been high, and the recent output has decreased. The prices sold in the current market are still mostly contrary to expectations.</p>
<h3>Wax Thread Linen Sells Widely</h3>
<p>The wax thread woven Chongma calico has been selling very well in the market recently. Large and small stores in the Western clothing gang have a great need for wholesale and retail. The Nanjing gang also has a strong appetite. Because it is the cheapest material for making Western clothing in the summer heat, it is quite popular and sells well. Customer clothing stores and uniform manufacturers continue to have designated demand. Yesterday, Fair and Lianxin brands, directly from the factory and large wholesalers and brokers, traded more than 100 pieces in the morning and afternoon. Beige is priced at 2 yuan and 30 cents, white is 2 yuan and 40 cents, and gray is 2 yuan and 50 cents. Beige is in strong demand, while gray and white colors are in relatively short supply. It is found that the factory's production is now mostly intended to deliver prepaid orders first, resulting in a shortage of spot inventory in the market, and the market price is even firmer than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Indian Coal Insists on Not Falling</h3>
<p>Indian bituminous coal has been scarce in recent months. Although the inventory in this city is very sufficient, merchants are unwilling to sell it at a discount. Therefore, during this period of slow sales, it can still be maintained, which is not without reason. Currently, the industry's discounted prices are 430 yuan per ton for lump coal and 375 yuan per ton for slack coal. The ex-warehouse price of foreign firms, plus barge costs, is firmer than last month.</p>
<h3>Schellan Bandon Oak Tree Declares Dividends</h3>

<h3>Western Newspapers Discuss Japan's Steps After the Breakdown of Dutch-Indonesian Negotiations: Rash Advance Southward Will Inevitably Fall into a Trap; the Netherlands, with British and American Assistance, Will Never Surrender</h3>
<p>An editorial in the English-language Great American Weekly stated that Japan's threats to the Dutch East Indies in the past week were obviously a clumsy imitation, but the skills were lacking and the situation was different. A rash course of action would inevitably fall into the most dangerous trap in history, it can be asserted.</p>
<p>Wandering at a Crossroads, Not Knowing What to Do</p>
<p>Japan's behavior is obviously copying Hitler's old articles, attempting to coerce small countries to submit to its demands. This method, applied to Czechoslovakia, Austria, Romania, and Bulgaria, was effective. But what the Japanese have not understood is that if this method cannot take effect, it must be followed by force to achieve its goals. However, Japan currently has no sign of moving troops south to Borneo, Java, and Sumatra. Then, its other method is only to retreat in the face of difficulty. But the problem lies in how to avoid losing face.</p>
<p>The Situation Between Vietnam and the Netherlands is Different Now Than in the Past</p>
<p>The reason why Tokyo attempted to intimidate and threaten the Netherlands was that Japan had successfully dealt with French Indochina in the same way. However, the situation in the Netherlands and France is fundamentally different. Because France was originally one of the European powers, and its colonies were all over the world, the loss of Vietnam alone would not have a significant impact. Therefore, the Vichy side believed that it was better to give up a corner with pain and preserve other areas rather than fight a war with no hope of victory. But the situation in the Netherlands is very different. If it loses the East Indies, the Netherlands' position will be equal to that of Albania. Therefore, the Netherlands will do its best to protect it and will not hesitate to fight to the death. Moreover, the Dutch East Indies has obtained assistance from the United States and America, which cannot be compared with Vietnam.</p>
<p>Retreating in the Face of Difficulty is Almost Inevitable</p>
<p>Today, the Netherlands has firmly rejected Japan's demands. The Netherlands has the assistance of Washington and London, while Tokyo cannot hope for effective help from Berlin and Rome. Tokyo's choice is either force or breaking its word. Based on the current situation, Japan will probably break its word, and breaking its word is Japan's masterpiece. Examples include returning the Guandong Peninsula to China, canceling the Twenty-One Demands, forcing China to submit, and no longer interacting with General Chiang Kai-shek, etc.</p>
<h3>It is Rumored that Twelve Soviet Merchant Ships Will Sail to the Far East; Three Have Arrived in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Amidst the scarcity of ships on various Far East routes, Soviet ships are taking the opportunity to act as substitutes. The Soviet authorities have dispatched twelve large merchant ships to sail to various parts of the Far East. In the future, in addition to sailing to Shanghai, they will specialize in sailing to Hong Kong, Singapore, or Rangoon. This is because of the business agreement between the Soviet Union and Thailand, and its routes will extend to Bangkok, Thailand, Calcutta, India, and other places. According to sources in the shipping industry, a total of three ships have arrived in Hong Kong. Two of them have entered the Taikoktsui Shipyard in Hong Kong for repairs, and one has entered the Kowloon Shipyard for repairs. Each ship has a displacement of more than 5,000 tons. All crew members are Russian. The kitchen, miscellaneous, and restaurant staff among the crew are all Russian women. On one of the ships, the shipowner and cook are also Russian women. It is expected that Soviet ships will sail to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Rangoon, Bangkok, and other places. Under the international situation, it is generally believed that they are safer than ships of other nationalities and their business will be more developed.</p>
<h3>The French Municipal Council Will Change Office Hours Starting Today</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council has recently changed its hours and issued a special announcement yesterday (15th). Starting today (16th), the office hours will be from 8:30 am to 12:00 pm and from 2:30 pm to 5:00 pm every day.</p>
<h3>The Whole City Consumes Electricity Thriftily; Electricity Consumption Decreases; Both Concessions Obtain Congratulations and Records</h3>
<p>The electricity companies in the two concessions in this city believe that the European war is expanding and the countries at war are successively requisitioning ships sailing to the Far East. As a result, the source of fuel for this city is feeling panic. Therefore, after obtaining the consent of the authorities of the two concessions at the beginning of this year, they have successively implemented electricity reduction measures. In order to achieve practical results, in addition to stipulating that those who exceed the electricity limit will be charged six times the fee, they have also carried out extensive publicity to persuade all industries to save unnecessary consumption. All citizens, in this time of hardship, are willing to work together, so they have also voluntarily saved electricity. According to reporters, the electricity consumption in April this year in the International Settlement was 56,242,000 kWh, of which 44,838,000 kWh was for industrial use and 6,092,000 kWh was for commercial use. Compared to March, industrial electricity consumption decreased by 2,057,000 kWh and commercial electricity consumption decreased by 1,081,000 kWh. The total electricity consumption in the French Concession in April was 5,100,000 kWh, which was also a decrease of 917,000 kWh compared to March. It is heard that the authorities of the two electricity companies in this city are still satisfied with this achievement, but they still hope that all sectors of the city will work hard to conserve electricity in order to achieve greater results.</p>
<h3>Freight Rates Between Hong Kong and Bangkok Increase Starting Yesterday; Freight Between Shanghai and Bangkok Has Not Yet Been Handled in the Same Way</h3>
<p>Since the British ships sailing on the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Rangoon route have suspended operations due to war-related military relations at Guangzhou Bay and Haiphong, Vietnam, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire in this port have transferred ships to operate the Rangoon route. As for the freight rates for ships from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Rangoon, they were once increased by 15% two months ago. On May 25, the freight rates from Hong Kong to Rangoon were increased by another 35%. It is also rumored that Butterfield &amp; Swire in Hong Kong announced that all freight rates between Hong Kong and Bangkok, including connecting freight, would be increased by approximately 25% starting yesterday. Reporters specially inquired about whether the prices of goods shipped from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Bangkok by the Taikoo company here will be increased at the same time. It is said that the goods shipped from Shanghai to Bangkok through Hong Kong are generally reported by the Taikoo Company headquarters in Hong Kong. This place has not yet taken the same measures as the Shanghai headquarters.</p>
<h3>After British and American Loans to China, the Stabilization Fund Increases Dramatically; the New Fund Totals 70 Million US Dollars and 5 Million Pounds of British Goods Loans to China</h3>
<p>After the British and American loans to China to maintain foreign exchange and the currency system, the China Stabilization Foreign Exchange Fund Committee was established. The members for China were Chen Guangfu, Xi Demao, and Bei Songsun. The members for the United Kingdom were Rogers, and the members for the United States were Fox. Now, the above five members have arrived in Chongqing one after another to discuss the Stabilization Fund Committee</p>
<p>Preliminary Work</p>
<p>It was decided to fully maintain the legal foreign exchange. For the import of necessities, foreign exchange will be supplied as much as possible after government approval. As for the black market in Shanghai, in order to take care of the friendly countries' trade with China, it will continue to be maintained. However, speculators who manipulate prices and those who arbitrage for profit will be cracked down on. All friendly banks in Shanghai and Chinese banks that handle foreign exchange will cooperate to assist the committee to eliminate all improper foreign exchange transactions to make it</p>
<p>Sustainable</p>
<p>Regarding the committee's fund, in addition to the 10 million pounds that have not been used up in the past, the new fund is 50 million US dollars in US loans to China, 5 million pounds in British loans to China, and 20 million US dollars loaned by the National Bank of China to the government. Therefore, the fund is very sufficient, and both foreign exchange and currency credit can be maintained. All Chinese and foreign industries have unanimously expressed their support for the establishment of the committee.</p>
<h3>Wage Increase for the Shanghai Municipal Council Employees Will Be Reconsidered Today; All Parties Hope to Overturn the Original Proposal</h3>
<p>The general wage increase plan for the Shanghai Municipal Council employees, since it was proposed by the Civil Service Commission, is believed by all sectors of the city to be sufficient to stimulate the rise in prices and make the public's living burden increasingly heavy. Therefore, it is urgently appealed that when the Municipal Council held its bi-weekly meeting last Wednesday, it once discussed the original proposal submitted by the Civil Service Commission. As a result, it was agreed to put it on hold temporarily. The increase in employees' salaries also makes it difficult for the Municipal Council's financial situation to be adjusted and raised. It is learned that the Civil Service Commission, under the order of the Board of Directors, is scheduled to convene a meeting at 4:30 pm today to re-examine the original wage increase proposal. Well-informed sources believe that today's Civil Service Commission meeting should adopt an extremely objective attitude and make the most prudent consideration. The points that should be noted are three: (1) The current basic salary, living allowance, and rice subsidy of the Municipal Council employees at all levels; (2) The general situation of current prices and whether there is a trend of rising step by step; (3) The salary and subsidy levels of other industries, and whether the levels of their salaries exceed those of the Municipal Council employees. Based on the above three points, it should be decided whether it is necessary to increase the salaries of the Municipal Council employees again based on the current objective situation. However, the general public believes that there is no most suitable reason for the Shanghai Municipal Council employees to increase their salaries again. For the sake of the happiness of the masses, it is hoped that the Civil Service Commission can overturn the original proposal at today's meeting. According to the rumored original wage increase plan of the Civil Service Commission, the employees' living allowance rate will be increased from 150% of the basic salary to 180% or 200%. It is also learned that, secondly, to increase the current net income of employees by 40%, or first add 20%, and then add another 20% as needed.</p>
<h3>Saigon Mixed Broken Rice Begins to Be Sold Off</h3>
<p>The Saigon No. 1 and 2 mixed broken rice, which is managed by the import committees of the French Concession and operated by foreign firms, was first approved for shipment this month to Shanghai for relief. Last Friday, the import committees received a telegram from Saigon saying that this broken rice will continue to be shipped to Shanghai for relief. After receiving the telegram, the foreign firms began to sell off the July futures. Various grain stores also actively ordered. It is estimated that on Saturday (the day before yesterday) morning, Shenji and Heyi foreign firms sold off a total of about 2,500 tons.</p>
<h3>After the Assassination of a Dada Merchant, the Search is Intensified</h3>
<p>After the Dada merchant and lawyer was shot and killed on the 13th of this month, the French police attached great importance to this bloody case. They are now actively searching for the fugitive shooter. It is learned that at 9:00 pm and 11:00 pm the night before, the French police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives and police cars to the inns on Tianzhu Church Street, Xin Yong'an Street, and Fada Road near the place where the Dada merchant was shot for a large-scale search, which lasted for a long time. As a result, there were still no gains.</p>
<p>Residents in the Nanshi District are All Subjected to Search</p>
<p>After the Dada merchant was assassinated on the 13th, the French Concession authorities suddenly strengthened their defense. Detectives are stationed at the iron gates in and out of Nanshi every day, and strict searches are carried out on pedestrians and vehicles. Since yesterday, Nanshi has also provided assistance, ordering pedestrians entering the concession to line up in a single file on the sidewalk in front of the Siming Guild Hall to proceed in turn. After passing through the iron gate, the detectives searched them one by one before letting them into the concession.</p>
<p>The Corpse is Scheduled to be Buried in the Public Cemetery</p>
<p>The Linxi Daily reported that after the French lawyer Dada was shot and killed in this port, his body has been moved from Guangci Hospital to Wanguo Funeral Home. It is scheduled to be buried in the Baxianqiao Public Cemetery at 9:00 am this Wednesday (18th). The French Concession Police Department is conducting a thorough investigation of the case and has determined that the murderer is a "terrorist." The office where Dada worked before his death was sealed off by the French Consulate authorities yesterday (14th).</p>
<h3>Today, All Sectors Commemorate the Passing of the Premier</h3>
<p>Today is the 19th anniversary of the Premier's passing in Guangzhou. According to central government regulations, the two anniversary days of June 16, the Premier's passing in Guangzhou, and October 11, the Premier's passing in London, have been merged and moved to September 9, the anniversary of the Premier's first uprising. Although all sectors of the city will not hold ceremonies, they recall that on this day 19 years ago, the Premier was killed in Guangzhou due to Chen Jiongming's rebellion for more than 50 days. Although the situation was extremely dangerous, the Premier relied on not fearing power and not fearing violence, and struggled hard. In a short time, the traitor finally fell, and the Northern Expedition was finally promoted smoothly. In this time of national crisis, in addition to deeply commemorating, all sectors are determined to emulate the Premier's perseverance and unyielding spirit, work hard to resist construction, strive for the final victory, complete independence and liberation, and continue to promote the frugal movement to meet the needs of national construction.</p>
<h3>Plague Outbreak in Ningbo</h3>
<p>The plague in Ningbo has recently relapsed. Due to the lack of management of sanitation work, it has spread rapidly since it occurred. The number of patients has reached more than 5,000, and the number of deaths totals more than 10.</p>
<h3>Western District Erection of Sandbag Fortifications to Strengthen Defense Work Due to Bandits Opening Fire and Rushing Through Obstacles, Authorities Forced to Adopt Better Protection</h3>
<p>Along the border roads in the western district of the Public Concession, sandbag "fortifications" have now been erected next to the barbed wire obstacles to provide better protection for the police officers stationed there. The police authorities have long intended to take this measure. On the 14th of this month, bandits rushed through the obstacles at the intersection of Hart Road and Robison Road and shot three police officers, which accelerated the implementation of this measure. Two days ago, workers hired by the Public Works Department filled the foundations for sandbag piles at the intersections of roads along the border.</p>
<p>Once Erected, No Date for Removal</p>
<p>The sandbag "fortification" at the intersection of Bubbling Well Road and Avenue Foch (on the 16th) has been completed, reaching shoulder height. Once erected, there is no foreseeable date for its removal. According to reports, on the 14th of this month, a group of kidnappers, escorting a hostage, attempted to rush through the obstacles at the Hart Road intersection and escape into the "badlands" of western Shanghai. Police officers intercepted them, and they were shot at, injuring three officers, one of whom was seriously wounded in the head. On May 13th, there was also a case of an exchange of gunfire between Yao's bodyguard and the police. The Jing'an Temple Police Station then reported to the Police Department requesting the addition of sandbags for protection.</p>

<h3>Japanese Navy Expands Again, Blockading South China Seas, No Impact on Transportation in Sino-Japanese Free Zones, Third-Country Shipping Suffers Further Setbacks</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side announced the blockade of the Chinese coast starting from June-July last year, the shipping of third countries has suffered greatly, while the foreign goods needed by China are all imported via the Burma Road, without affecting the situation. Shimada, commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, announced the expansion of the Japanese military blockade line along the South China coast the day before yesterday, expanding the blockade area in Guangzhou Bay and other sea areas: (1) Haimen Bay, Qiwang Bay, and nearby sea areas west of Lotus Peak Cape of Good Hope; (2) Songlin Bay, Zhaoan Bay, Tongshan Bay, Futou Bay, and nearby sea areas included in the line connecting Da Mao Wu, the southern end of Nanao Island, Shizi Island, and Chiyu Jiangjun'ao in a cross shape. The Japanese Consulate in Shanghai has notified the Jianghai Customs and the consulates of various countries in Shanghai that it will take effect from zero hours on the morning of the 17th (tomorrow). However, there are no shipping lines between Shanghai and the above-mentioned places, and the customs has not announced the suspension of customs clearance.</p>
<h3>Robbers Open Fire, Resist Arrest, One Thief Shot, Two Captured Alive</h3>
<p>At around 9 p.m. last night, a man was walking near North Szechuan Road and Chekiang Road when he was suddenly encountered by four robbers who blocked his way. One of the robbers hid a pistol in his long gown, the muzzle pointing out as a threat. He was robbed of a gold ring worth more than fifty yuan. As they were trying to escape, the man suspected that the gun held by the robber was a fake, so he shouted "Catch the thief!" and went forward to grab one of the robbers. Another robber fled south to the Dongxin Bridge on Avenue Edward VII when he happened upon detectives from the French Police Department inspecting pedestrians. Seeing that the three people looked flustered, he ordered them to stop and intended to search them. The robbers took the initiative and opened fire to resist arrest. The detective also drew his gun and fired back, wounding one of the robbers on the spot, a bullet hitting his abdomen. A pistol and five bullets were found on his body. Another robber was captured alive, while the other robber escaped without a trace. Afterwards, the injured robber was taken to Guangci Hospital. Because the incident occurred in the Public Concession, the injured robber was transferred to the Public Concession Police Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Aiding Mother in Abusing Wife, Young Owner of Southern Goods Store Arrested</h3>
<p>Zi Senquan, a native of Ningbo, the young owner of Da Hua Southern Goods Store at 190 Rue Mère Mathilde, 22 years old, married a woman of the same town, Ms. Ding (currently 21 years old), in October last year. The couple got along harmoniously after the marriage, but Zi Senquan's mother, Zhu (49 years old), for some reason, had no good feelings for her daughter-in-law, and recently regarded her as a thorn in her side, often scolding her for trivial matters, and sometimes beating her. Ms. Ding had no choice but to tell her husband the truth, but she was also scolded. Recently, Zi Senquan even helped his mother abuse his wife. If she was slightly unsatisfactory, he would beat her. A few days ago, due to some trivial matter, the mother and son beat Ms. Ding at home. The neighbors were indignant and secretly reported it to the French Police Department. The police sent personnel to arrest Zhu and her son. Ms. Ding was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Lord Mayor of London Cables Thanks to Shanghai British War Relief Society for Funds</h3>

The cable of thanks was sent from London on the 10th of this month, stating the use of the donation of 1,300 pounds. It is reported that the Shanghai British Distress Fund remitted a large sum of 1,000 pounds to London in April this year because London was bombed and the disaster was severe, for the purpose of refugee relief expenses. Since the outbreak of the European War, the British War Relief Society has remitted a total of 154,445 pounds to the British capital.</p>
<h3>Notes on Male and Female Suicides</h3>
<p>At around 12:00 noon yesterday, Yang Huifang (22 years old), a young woman living at No. 26 Jixiang Lane, Henan Road, Public Concession, suddenly committed suicide by taking poison in her room. Her family found a medicine bottle on the table and realized she had taken her own life. She was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Chen Qiantao (22 years old), a man residing at No. 34, Lane 429, Rue Amiral Bayle, also committed suicide by swallowing raw opium at home yesterday noon. Afterwards, he was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Chen Luo, wife of Chen Sicong, owner of Liangyou Hosiery Factory, Ningbo native, at No. 20, Lane 44, Rue du Père Robert, French Concession, this year of twelve, had an argument with her mother, Luo Zhou, after drinking alcohol at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, and suddenly had a suicidal thought. She committed suicide by swallowing potion. After being discovered by her family, she was sent to Guangci Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and she died at 4 a.m. the next morning.</p>
<h3>Direct Communication Between New York and San Francisco with South America, Announced by Shanghai Branch of Globe Wireless Company</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the American Globe Wireless Telegraph Company recently announced that the company has applied to the Washington Federal Communications Commission for permission to open the first direct wireless telegraph service between San Francisco and Bogota (Colombia, South America) and between New York and Bogota. The company also plans to reduce the telegraph fees from San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, and Los Angeles to Bogota by 14%, and the telegraph fees between New York and Bogota by 12%. The current telegraph fees have not changed for more than 15 years. The reduction of fees and the establishment of direct wireless telegraph service will encourage a more complete understanding and closer connection between the United States and South America.</p>
<h3>Shiliupu Ground Goods Industry Subject to Control Again Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to news from the ground goods industry yesterday, the Shiliupu ground goods industry has joined a certain Nanshi branch for business starting yesterday. According to reports, when the market was established in July last year, it had urged the Shiliupu ground goods industry to join, but the industry firmly refused because it did not conform to its business habits. Until recently, some small vegetable vendors who set up stalls for open-air business were forced to join the larger ground goods businesses due to livelihood pressure. Due to the special circumstances, they had to reluctantly join. It is said that the conditions for Shiliupu merchants to join are as follows: (1) The iron gate connecting the Nanshi Shiliupu, which used to open at 5 a.m. every morning and close at 10 p.m., has been changed to open earlier at 3 a.m. and close later at 12 p.m. in order to facilitate the access of merchants and vendors. (2) The vegetable market must be covered with straw sheds to prevent vegetables from being exposed to rain and sun. (3) The market side may collect a commission of 3 cents per yuan of goods value. (4) Prices must be estimated according to the actual situation in the market. According to a person in the ground goods industry, currently the goods that have joined, in addition to some vegetables transported from Pudong, are mainly eggplants, night-blooming cereus, and edamame transported from Hangzhou, totaling more than 1,000 pieces per day, with a total business volume of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. As for the fruits transported to Shanghai, they are not involved because the sources are different.</p>
<h3>Small Denomination Notes in Short Supply in Ningbo City, Large Denomination Notes Used at 80% of Face Value</h3>
<p>Since the Ningbo Incident, the commercial market has not yet recovered. The crux of the problem lies in the withdrawal of the four banks, which makes financial circulation impossible. Residents avoid coming to Shanghai or hide in their hometowns, and the urban area population is sparse.</p>
<p>Before the Ningbo Incident, the currency in circulation was mostly in denominations of 50 yuan and 100 yuan. The notes were all stamped with the words "Chongqing" to prevent them from flowing into the occupied areas. These large denomination notes were called "large notes" locally. In the past, they could be exchanged at the four banks, so they could indirectly promote the prosperity of the commercial market.</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal of the four banks, these large notes cannot be exchanged, which has seriously hit the business community, and the small denomination notes left in the Ningbo market have all flowed to Shanghai to purchase rice, resulting in an increasing shortage of circulating funds in the Ningbo market, which is similar to suffering from anemia. The merchants and people are even more distressed, and large denomination notes are used at 80% of face value.</p>
<p>The Ningyu Steamer</p>
<p>is afraid of being requisitioned, so it is still stranded in Yuyao, so the traffic between Ningbo and Yuyao only relies on boats, and the schedule is extremely chaotic. The serious rice shortage has not been alleviated at all, but has become even worse. There are already Japanese liaison ships sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo, each carrying Ningbo local products for export to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Old Woman Falls to Her Death</h3>
<p>Zhang Bu, an old woman from Wuxi residing at 157 Mingguo Road, 59 years old this year, has been suffering from mental illness due to the recent harsh environment. Her daily actions were abnormal. At 7 p.m. on the 14th, she accidentally fell down the stairs at home, and her head was injured, causing her to faint. She was sent to Guangci Hospital, but it was too late to save her life.</p>
<h3>On the Works of Ni Yide</h3>
<p>— Zhaotong</p>
<p>Although Impressionist painting brought about a major revolution in color, the result was that their own works became a game of color, forming a delicate, empty, and aesthetic expression. As the times have changed, nine out of ten Western painters who have even a slight inclination have been more or less influenced by Impressionism. However, in the works of Ni Yide, there is not a trace of such an influence. On the contrary, he belongs to the era before Impressionism, or after Cézanne. The characteristic of his style is the expression of a giant's sense of form, the establishment of a majestic realism, laying a solid and unshakable foundation for China's new art.</p>
<p>From such technical cultivation, he went on to pay attention to the issue of subject matter. Western painting, from Impressionism to the modern 20th century, paid too much attention to "how to express," but forgot the question of "what to express," thus falling into the shortcomings of the emptiness of content in painting. Soviet socialist new realism and the recent French Surrealism are powerful reactions to this tendency. Starting from the ideas of new realism and surrealism, he conceived a kind of nationalistic subject matter.</p>
<p>The so-called "expression of the national spirit" is a very vague statement. What kind of national spirit do we need after all? The kind of lofty, elegant, chic, and detached taste expressed in traditional Chinese painting, which is praised by Westerners as the Chinese national spirit, is it what modern China needs? The Chinese national spirit has been transformed since the Jin and Tang Dynasties due to the influence of Lao-Zhuang philosophy, especially the influx of Buddhist thought. We can see the most obvious examples of the expression of this transformed national spirit in Li Bai's poems and in Yun Lin and Shi Tao's paintings. The true Chinese national spirit should be before the Qin and Han Dynasties, which was a spirit of majestic tragedy, generosity, and chivalry, a spirit with a sense of reality, a "Great Knight's soul." The most concrete and clear expression of this spirit in literary and artistic works is Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian." Shaping and modernizing this spirit is probably the theme attempted in Ni's recent works.</p>
<p>However, there is a clear distinction between works of art and propaganda posters. The nature of propaganda posters is explanatory, analytical, and enumerative, while the expression in works of art is symbolic, suggestive, and comprehensive. Therefore, a painting with content does not necessarily have to be a narrative of a story or an explanation of an idea. It is a complete and elusive thing. We cannot understand it, but only feel it. For example, what is depicted in Ni's recent work "Great Han" is only a horse, two Great Hans, and a background of yellow earth. However, in this, we can understand the tragic mood of the ancient poet's "A solitary smoke rises straight from the desert, the setting sun hangs round over the Yellow River." At the same time, we can also imagine the sacred mission of modern Chinese youth in the Central Plains and outside the Great Wall. The "Virgin Land" represents the development of the resources of Free China. "Plateau" only depicts two horses, but the horses seem to be personified, with a firm and resolute character. The form is magnificent and bold. The painting "Nostalgia" adopts the techniques of the Surrealist school, expressing the mood of the long and great ancient China.</p>
<p>The Italian modern painter Chirico (Theme) modernizes the memory of ancient Rome. Ni's works have similarities with Chirico. He is trying to modernize the shaping of the great spirit of the ancient Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Such works have gone beyond appreciation and taste, and are commemorative works of a permanent nature.</p>
<h3>YMCA Health Campaign Closes</h3>
<p>The summer health campaign organized by the YMCA closed yesterday. The number of visitors broke all previous records. The exhibits and health knowledge listed were of great benefit, so the guests were all interested in it. In view of the fact that external diseases such as boils, heat rash, scabies, and dampness are extremely popular this season, the association has obtained a large number of "Ding's Ointment" from Hua Yi Pharmaceutical Factory and distributed them to guests to maintain their health. Those who received it were all delighted. The fact that this exhibition achieved such a satisfactory result in the shortest possible time is due to the efforts of the association, and the tireless assistance of major pharmaceutical factories in Shanghai such as Wuzhou, Hua Yi, and Guangming is also particularly meritorious.</p>
<h3>Xinhua Underwear Company Store Opening Pre-Announcement</h3>
<p>Xinhua Underwear Company is the largest, most modernly equipped, and most productive underwear manufacturing expert in the country. The Penguin brand shirts produced are of extremely noble raw material styles, so they are popular in China and foreign countries. Recently, the company has expanded its business and opened a new store at No. 1202 Jing'an Temple Road, opposite the Cangzhou Hotel. The decoration is new and the layout is artistic. All the staff have been specially trained. In order to commemorate the opening, it has entrusted major theaters, dance halls, and restaurants to distribute commemorative gift coupons worth 100,000 yuan, which can be used as purchase credit. There will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Modern Art Exhibition Opens Today, Location in the Da Sun Department Store Art Gallery</h3>
<p>The Modern Art Exhibition, which is of great significance in culture, will open this morning in the Da Sun Art Gallery. The exhibits of the exhibition can be divided into two parts. The first part is the works of artists, including the works of Ding Yanyong, Ni Yide, Guan Zilan, and Guan Liang. The second part is the works of young artists, including Miss Shen Ziyin and Zhao Wuji, Hei Shala, Hu Xianwu, Yang Zirong, Chen Yizhong, Luo Shuqi, Xu Xin, Cheng Yiyuan, and Wang Shounian. Although the styles are different, they can all express the progressive spirit of modern Chinese youth. It is said that the exhibition will be held for seven days. Those who are concerned about culture and want to appreciate modern art should be the first to see it.</p>

<h3>Several Students Studying in the US Stranded in Hong Kong, Unable to Travel, Due to President Liner Suspending Carrying Ordinary Passengers to the US, China Foundation Committee Cables Ministry of Foreign Affairs Requesting Negotiation</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) More than 50 students sent to study in the US on public funds in the fifth session of Tsinghua University, Southwest Associated University, and the China Education Foundation Committee, as well as many other students sent by other groups or at their own expense, had previously entrusted the China Travel Service to handle the purchase of President Liner tickets to study in the US. It is reported that the President Liner Company has suspended the sale of tickets, causing them to be stranded and unable to travel. These students are quite anxious about this matter. The China Travel Service is now planning to prepare or change to the Euro-American Airlines Hong Kong-US Clipper and the Pacifie lines departing from Manila via Honolulu to San Francisco, which still carry ordinary passengers to the US. Regarding this matter, it is said that the China Education Foundation Committee will cable the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting negotiations with the US government.</p>

<p>Study Lecture</p>
<h3>How to Study English (4)</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>This method may feel unfamiliar at first, but you will naturally get used to it after one or two tries. This approach has at least two benefits: (1) it helps you understand how to structure paragraphs in writing, and (2) having grasped the overall meaning, you can guess the meaning of unfamiliar words to some extent in each sentence. Even when consulting a dictionary, you won't feel completely lost about how to interpret the word. It's quite exciting to guess six or seven tenths of the word's meaning. 1. What to Pay Attention To The author's habit is to focus on the longest sentence, the shortest sentence, or the most irregular sentence in a paragraph. While this method may not be a perfect guide, it can spark interest in studying. However, the most important thing is to pay attention to structures that differ from Chinese. For example:</p>
<p>I went there on business.</p>
<p>This translates to "I went there to do something." If the sentence uses a special structure:</p>
<p>Business took me there.</p>
<p>This requires special attention, as this type of construction is rare or perhaps non-existent in Chinese sentences. Sentence structures like this are common in English, but it's difficult for us to think of them when we write ourselves. Passive voice constructions are also used frequently in English, which we don't tend to use as much. Consequently, our sentences often have a Chinese flavor. Next, we should pay attention to idioms. For example:</p>
<p>She has left her home for good and all. Some people might not understand this sentence. If we translate it as "She left her home for good and all good," it would be a joke. This is because we don't understand that "for good" means "forever" and "and all" means "altogether," so we don't know it should be interpreted as "She has abandoned her home forever."</p>
<p>If we want our English to be elegant, we must understand and accurately use these idioms.</p>
<p>Next, we should pay attention to meaningful individual words. For English learners, a good word is a treasure. These treasures are our assets. However, these treasures have wings. Even if you catch them for a moment, they will fly away if you are not careful. To hold onto them, it's best to use them often.</p>

<h3>The Philosophy of Beauty</h3>
<p>— Wang Yizhi</p>
<p>—— Shanghai people's greatest shortcomings are "transportation" and "housing"——</p>
<p>As the nation faces difficulties, everyone shares the sorrow. The scarcity of resources leads to mental distress, which is not unique to Shanghai, nor limited to China. However, human effort matters, and the environment is shaped by the mind. Finding solace in one's spirit can often compensate for material poverty. I have a piece of advice for readers: "Happiness, health, and beauty are mutually causal." A love for beauty is a natural right shared by all humanity. When people are struggling with hunger and cold, they have no time to think about "beauty." If one is trapped in a cold place, like a great, freezing church, listening to a famous musician, they might retreat in fear, having no heart to appreciate the beauty of the pure sounds. When people are extremely tired, they also don't know how to find pleasure in beauty. Laborers like cattle and horses, as well as domestic servants, fall asleep as soon as their work is done and never feel any beauty in their lives. Similarly, child brides under the oppressive authority of old Chinese families, and children in some families who are restricted by tradition and unable to express their natural inclinations, as well as child laborers in the early industrial age in foreign countries who were not protected by laws, and apprentices who spent their lives hunched over before machines were invented, generally appear half-withered. Those who look at them cannot feel any positive emotions. When this happens to women, it can even make it difficult for them to find a suitable partner for life. A recent poem says, "Surely their inner thoughts will never be understood, they entrust their flowering talent to a sick plum blossom." These few words fully express the hidden pain of human destruction of natural beauty.</p>
<p>Moreover, people have different heights. Although it is said that there are racial differences between East and West, I observe that in European and North American countries, free people who are well-fed and well-clothed produce children who steadily grow taller and stronger (not like the children of the poor who are thin despite being tall). In contrast, in the Chinese nation, with its four thousand years of history, due to a lack of mental well-being and outdoor exercise, the stature of later generations has gradually become smaller. This is the opposite. Deciding when humans age, although it differs due to race, since the founding of the Republic, new families have escaped the troubles of concubines and the hardship of mother-in-law relationships. We often see that married middle-aged women are more beautiful than middle-aged spinsters. As for the graceful appearance of young people studying in America, it is because school villages in the New World are conducive to being close to nature and daring to beautify themselves, or working hard at sports to develop their physique, or learning social skills to harmonize their natural instincts. The easiest exercise is to walk long distances, and the most beneficial social activity is to be brave in helping others. This is the greatest pleasure and benefit that even a poor country like China, or an isolated island like Shanghai, can offer to everyone.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, the use of beauty is extensive. The happiness it brings is both immediate and far-reaching. Who would not hope that their spouse and children become more beautiful day by day? For people in Shanghai, the greatest shortcomings are "transportation" and "housing." When traveling, one cannot always walk on shady paths, and there is little pleasure in strolling. When living, one cannot expand the courtyard at home, and the temperament of children deteriorates. However, all the inventions, accomplishments, and most of the amazing achievements in the world often originate from temporary hardship, or from a self-interested and selfish thought, suddenly gaining unexpected happiness and joy. If we want to do our best to compensate for the lack of nature, then in these years of worrying about hunger and cold, we should pay attention to the reason why happiness, health, and beauty are mutually causal. Perhaps every day there must be a certain time to approach art, music (such as phonograph records), or heart-pleasing poetry, books, and literature as much as possible to temporarily forget the environment of life. Or rely on strong will and self-discipline, never to hurt people with harsh words and expressions (certainly not wanting to inflict harsh words and expressions on children), relying on this to cultivate the ecological beauty of companions and groups that has not yet been lost. Or learn to work hard and move more, be careful about food, and thus express their own healthy beauty. Shanghai is now one of China's major cities and is also convenient for approaching world trends, so it will not be like those trapped in remote and poor villages who tend to decline due to the lack of external objects for reference. It is truly unfortunate but fortunate.</p>
<h3>Talking About Raincoats in the Plum Rain Season</h3>
<p>— Huang Ziqiang</p>
<p>The times are constantly progressing. When our country had not yet discovered raincoats, everyone used umbrellas to shield themselves from the rain. Later, Europe and the United States imported a kind of raincoat, which was worn on the body, both lightweight and comfortable. Raincoats are divided into many types due to the different materials:</p>
<p>First: Rubber raincoats. There are also two types of this kind of raincoat: pure rubber and laminated rubber. Pure rubber raincoats are relatively thick and heavy in texture, but they are not strong and easily tear. Laminated rubber raincoats cannot be washed clean of dirt, or they easily let water in after washing; at the same time, after being exposed to rain and water, they gradually increase the weight of the raincoat, which is extremely unsanitary for the body, especially too cold in winter and too hot in summer.</p>
<p>Second: Rainproof cloth raincoats. The texture is relatively light and convenient, but they cannot waterproof when encountering heavy rain or staying in the rain for a long time; at the same time, the effectiveness is lost after three or four washes, so they are not durable to wear; another disadvantage is that, like rubber raincoats, they are not suitable for winter and summer.</p>
<p>Third: Transparent oil silk raincoats. This kind of raincoat is thin and light, comfortable to wear, and the solid texture allows air to permeate, allowing body temperature to evaporate. Furthermore, stains can be wiped off easily. They are most suitable for wearing outside coats in winter.</p>
<p>According to customs reports, more than 13 million yuan of foreign goods are imported every year. In recent years, especially Japanese goods, the number of imports has occupied the first place. The first type of laminated rubber raincoats and the third type of oil silk raincoats are mostly Japanese goods on the market. There are also many American goods, and the texture varies, with American goods being the most refined, but the price is extremely high, requiring more than one hundred yuan per item.</p>
<p>It was not until the past two or three years that domestic oil silk raincoats began to be produced. According to the current consensus in the domestic raincoat industry, the products produced by the Meilun Waterproof Fabrics Factory are the most refined and can be compared with American goods, while the price is only half of the American goods.</p>
<p>One of the main raw materials for oil silk transparent raincoats is silk. Since the occupied areas were controlled, Shanghai has been unable to purchase high-quality silk materials, which has had a great impact on the output of the domestic industry. However, Meilun was able to find ways to make up for the deficiency under these difficult circumstances, and the products can still be compared with American goods, which is truly the glory of the domestic industry.</p>

<h3>Monday Home Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Sword beans have not been on the market for long and are still very tender. They cost about 30 cents per pound, which is not cheap, but if you add some auxiliary ingredients, one pound can make two small bowls for both day and night meals. There are not many ways to cook sword beans. For meat dishes, you can only stir-fry them with shredded pork, braise them with sliced pork, or add them to eel shreds as a representative of a flat dish, which is also not impossible. As for vegetarian dishes, you can stir-fry them with sliced water chestnuts or dried tofu shreds, or braise them with fragrant mushrooms and tofu. Vegetarian old ladies will definitely welcome them.</p>

<h3>Snail Dwelling and Conch Domain</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>It is not easy to live in Chang'an. Land is expensive in Shanghai, even more so than in Chang'an. One's space for eating, drinking, and resting is confined to a corner, to the point where it is difficult to even unroll a scroll or settle down to study. How much more so for those who burn incense, play the zither, discuss swords, or play the flute. In the past, my late friend Hu Jichen called his residence "Snail Dwelling," describing its narrowness, which can be said to be very apt. Xie Zixian, known as Xian'ou, is skilled in the six methods of painting. With his brilliant brushwork, he depicts the illusory scene of the Conch Domain, making people smile knowingly and further believe in the special nature of life in Shanghai. His illusory scenes of the Conch Domain are often drawn on postcards. Among the green peaks and beautiful ravines are several butterflies. Within them, there are several monks, and several things such as chimes, money, banners, and canopies, as well as all the details of palm-leaf scriptures, prayer cushions, bright lamps, and Buddha niches, all exquisitely prepared. When viewed with a magnifying glass, the faces are lifelike, and the expressions are vivid. Mustard seed Sumeru, seeing the big in the small, is truly the ultimate in bizarre and varied skills, which only famous masters can achieve. However, Xie Zi does not do it easily because it consumes too much eyesight and time. Now, a collotype edition of Xie Xian'ou's painting collection has been printed and is being distributed by the World Bookstore. The figures, ladies, landscapes, and Buddhist images are all extremely marvelous, and the illusory scenes of the Conch Domain are especially worthy of appreciation. The taste of the game opens up the mountain art garden. The saying goes, "Creation enters the tip of the brush, and the tip of the brush steals creation." Xie Zi's skills are truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Cars on the Streets of Moscow</h3>
<p>— Xi Nong</p>
<p>We have long been accustomed to seeing cars in Shanghai, but they are all imported products loaded from Europe or the New World. However, most of the cars seen on the streets of Moscow now are made by the Soviet Union's own Gorky and Moscow factories.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union had no automobile industry ten years ago; however, the automobile industry in recent years has advanced rapidly and developed quickly. The Soviet masses already have great strength and good car-making technology; the products of the Gorky and Moscow two major automobile factories are still not enough to meet the needs and are being expanded as much as possible.</p>
<p>The cars on the streets of Moscow are now like those in major cities around the world, passing through like waves in teams; trucks and most passenger cars belong to state public institutions. Other factories, newspapers, clubs, and social organizations all have service cars and office cars; thousands of workers come and go, rushing to their future with heroism.</p>
<p>Under capitalism, workers naturally acknowledge that cars are the exclusive property of exploiters; privately owned black-plated cars are even more symbols of exploiters. So, perhaps there will be no privately owned black-plated cars in the socialist capital of Moscow? But in fact, citizens of Moscow also have privately owned cars. This is a manifestation of the prosperity of the Soviet people; privately owned cars only began after the Soviet Union had its own automobile industry. I remember that six years ago, the Soviet government issued an order that pilots who flew more than 300,000 kilometers could receive a car for transportation. In recent years, the most technically superior workers at the Moscow Gorky Automobile Factory have each been given a car. It can be seen that privately owned cars on the streets of Moscow are the result of the excellent achievements of technically superior workers; and they are very different from privately owned black-plated cars in our Shanghai.</p>
<p>Correction: Regarding the article "Cart Drivers in the Southwest" last week, I recently received a letter from a reader stating that "cart driver" should be changed to "car driver," and "truck driver" in the article should also be changed to "truck driver." This correction is made above.</p>

<h3>Such a Second Landlord</h3>
<p>— Third Tenant</p>
<p>Greedy and Insatiable, Not Just a Landworm, Extremely Vicious and Fierce, More Than a Female Tiger</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Please allow your esteemed publication a valuable corner for a small citizen to voice a faint cry.</p>
<p>Dragon Coiling and Tiger Crouching, a Way to Make Money</p>
<p>I really can't describe the heart of the second landlord. Of course, any kind of people are a mix of good and bad. However, this landlord of mine can be said to be the representative of the personality of "Shanghai Second Landlords." He became a second landlord before the Incident, with very small rents and no transfer fees. Even now, after the new rent increase, the three-story building is only a little over 120 yuan; in addition to living in two floors himself, he charges almost 300 yuan for the three rooms on the third floor and one room on the second floor? The location is in an alley at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Luber, which has never been vacant. Since the Incident, it has been even more profitable three times over.</p>
<p>He raises the rent at least four times a year, and also charges for tap water, electricity, house taxes, and even the streetlights at the alley entrance, the strips used in the kitchen, and the funnels for pouring water. He almost demands everything from the third tenants every day. In fact, the cost of tap water and electricity has only increased by a few tens of percent at most, but he wants to exceed the fixed price.</p>
<p>Adding Three and Five, Following the Current</p>
<p>Taking last year as an example, the rent and tap water fees have been increased four or five times. In January of this year, he increased the rent again. His reason for the rent increase was that the first landlord had increased his rent, which was a legitimate reason, and the obligation of the third tenants was undeniable. Unexpectedly, three months later, last month, the second landlord's wife issued an order to increase the rent again. She said, "The first landlord has increased the rent, the tap water fee has also risen, and next month there will be an increase in house taxes, so we have to increase your rent as well. If you don't want to pay more, move out quickly." The few of us third tenants were not afraid of her female authority, but felt strange. Why did the first landlord increase the rent in January, and now the first landlord is increasing the rent again? The first landlord's increase is a general increase and can never increase twice in four months. So, everyone inquired separately and found out that the rent increase in February was driven by the second landlord's greed, and this rent increase was actually instigated by the first landlord.</p>
<p>Extra Profit, Forty-Nine Percent</p>
<p>However, we now realize that he was fraudulent last time and should ask him to refund the rent he increased last time. Then, we should increase the rent from the date when the first landlord increased his rent, which would be a reasonable solution. However, the second landlord will not reason with you, and there are even more unreasonable things than this. The French Concession tap water fee has only increased by 26 percent this time, as recorded in the newspaper, and everyone knows it. He has to increase it by 75 percent (based on the original basic amount of the tap water fee). What is the reason for this? Only he himself knows, which is that because the tap water fee has increased, you, the third tenants, have to pay for the water he uses himself. In the past, he decided the electricity bill, and you had to pay whatever he said you used. Now, some of us third tenants have installed our own water meters, and this time she copied the codes and found that they did not match the last digit. Isn't this clearly a trick she is playing? There is also a joke that one of our tenants does not play mahjong with his family, which is also a factor in the rent increase.</p>
<p>Man in the Inner Quarters, Woman Leaving the River East</p>
<p>The world is so big, there is everything, and there are even more strange things about landlords in Shanghai. Our second landlord, Mr. Zhu, hides in the room and does not come out (this not coming out means not meeting with the third tenants, because when he comes out, he has his own car to ride in). He lets his wife come out and confront us. It is not an exaggeration to call her a female tiger. Because she sees that the third tenants are unwilling to increase the rent, she will refuse to collect the rent, and at the same time, she will issue a roar demanding that you move out immediately! If the second tenant ignores her, she will even quarrel with you, with great momentum and boundless anger, wanting to fight and use force, stop supplying tap water, cut off electricity lines, and even more inhumanely, when you are cooking, she will stir up dust and let it fall into your food. She keeps saying that she wants to hit people, saying, "If a woman hits a man, the man does not dare to fight back." Her purpose is that because she cannot resolve things with you through reason or law, she wants to disturb you and insult you privately, sparing no effort to use the most despicable means to make you unable to live in peace, unless you increase the rent.</p>
<p>She does not understand justice, she forgets public health and public order, and she does not know the law. She only knows how to use despicable and dirty means to fight for her own petty interests.</p>
<p>But what about "him"? Will this Mr. Zhu always hide in the room and not come out? A third tenant on Avenue Joffre respectfully submits</p>

<h3>Also Considered "Long-Gown Class"</h3>
<p>— Sun Yifan</p>
<p>May I ask, can you wear a short shirt to class as a teacher? That has probably never happened before! The little children all wear long gowns, although most of them are torn and patched. Can teachers not wear long gowns? Can they not be properly dressed? Standing on the podium, what would they look like? In fact, teachers are exactly the same as coolies, only with the distinction of "long gown" and "short shirt."</p>
<p>In principle, we can no longer afford to wear long gowns. Look! Rice, coal, and daily necessities are getting more expensive day by day, but salaries remain the same. I'm afraid the long gown with eight holes on my body will have to rely on patching again. In fact, my wife at home has already worn short shirts (not because it's hot). Am I also considered "long-gown class"? What about the entire elementary school teacher community?</p>
<p>"Long-gown class" has face but no substance.</p>
<p>"Teacher, your long gown is torn!"</p>
<p>— Starfire made</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(9) An Eccentric Farmer</p>
<p>He sat down again on the wooden bench in front of the lamp. The letter Zhao Si had asked someone to write for him was taken out and looked at for the seventh time: The Dong Province Colonial Bank has already collapsed. Is there any hope of recovering even half a penny of the more than three thousand yuan? What should he do if the Fuhua Bank also went bankrupt in the same way?</p>
<p>A gust of cold wind blew in again through the cracks in the window, causing him to unconsciously tighten the cloth belt around his waist even more.</p>
<p>"I'll set off tomorrow to rush there. I wonder if it's still in time?" He thought that since things had become so serious, he certainly had to make a trip; but when his fingers stroked his face, the two intersecting scars, the scraps of skin rolled up like the edges of dumplings, and the small piece missing from his nose, all made him so discouraged that he dared not even think of going out.</p>
<p>For the past three or four years, because he had been with those farmers all along, they had gradually become accustomed to his strange appearance, and the self-consciousness and shame in his heart had unknowingly diminished day by day. Now that he suddenly had to go out, he really didn't know what method to use to muster up his courage.</p>
<p>He repeatedly stuffed Zhao Si's letter into a pocket on his shirt, then straightened the short blue cotton-padded jacket he was wearing on the outside, and slowly stood up from the wooden bench.</p>
<p>"Why, child, why aren't you asleep yet?" He turned his head and looked towards the kang, and Mei Bao's eyes were still not closed, her face revealing a kind of melancholy rarely seen in children.</p>
<p>"Papa, today the nanny said that her whole family is going back...!."</p>
<p>This was another unexpected piece of news.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, child, she's just saying that to tease you."</p>
<p>"No, Papa, it's true!" Even though Mei Bao was still a six-year-old child, she could no longer be fooled about what was true and what was false. "Brother and sister are both... both saying that. Their papa, who is... that Wang Si, is putting clothes... putting them into... boxes...!."</p>
<p>"What?" Begonia asked in surprise. (133)</p>
<h3>Encountering a Soulmate</h3>
<p>— Xinghua</p>
<p>I have been unemployed for a long time and I am very bored at home. Every day, I just run around the roads and walk around everywhere. Today, I unintentionally met an old friend whom I had not seen for many years.</p>
<p>"Hello! Long time no see." He greeted me first.</p>
<p>"Old Li, I didn't expect that we would meet on the road."</p>
<p>"The weather is really nice today! Haha!" After inspecting me from head to toe.</p>
<p>"The weather is really nice, haha! Haha,"勉强地(reluctantly).</p>
<p>"Very good! Very good, haha!"</p>
<p>"You must be very successful lately, old brother."</p>
<p>"Where, where, it is said that you have made a fortune lately."</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, I have been unemployed at home for the past few days. Old brother, you have a wide social circle, can you help me find a job?" Impulsively.</p>
<p>"This... this..." His two eyebrows squeezed together, his nostrils turned upwards.</p>
<p>"As long as it's enough to maintain my livelihood, I don't care about the salary." I knew I was being too presumptuous.</p>
<p>"...Look, how spirited that foreigner walks!" I didn't expect him to answer like that.</p>
<p>"What! You won't even help with this small favor?"</p>
<p>"Hmm, what song is that foreigner humming? Oh! I remember! I have a meeting today! Excuse me, I won't keep you company, goodbye!"</p>
<p>"......" I stood blankly at the crossroads.</p>
