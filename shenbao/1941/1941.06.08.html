<p>社評</p>
<h3>軸心攻勢的再檢討</h3>
<p>德義兩國巨頭於本月二日在勃倫　山隘長談五小時之久，究竟談了些什麼，決定了些什麼，言人人殊，始終沒有一個確切報告。彙集各方報道，似乎雙方會談的主要內容，仍不外（一）確定今後的軍事行動，（二）應付美國參戰的可能性，以及（三）商討如何建設「歐洲新秩序」，以應付未來可能的長期戰。關於第三點，間題側重於經濟的改組和資源的調整，關於第二點，一說德義將迫令美國在準備完成之前參戰，另一說則謂軸心國仍將慫恿日本行動，以牽掣美國，個中問題異常微妙，容當另文爲之剖析，茲請單就第一點加以檢討。</p>
<p>近日一般看法，大多認爲德義的次期攻勢，不出東進與西進兩途，或東西並進。所謂西進，即是猛撲直布羅陀，以切斷西地中海的咽喉；所謂東進，則爲趁着最近巴爾幹和克利特島的勝利，繼續在東地中海採取攻勢，一方利用傘兵進撲埃及，一方憑藉叙利亞以突擊巴勒斯坦和外的丹，然後再利用兩翼包抄的戰略，會攻蘇彝士運河這個重耍據點；不過，無論東進或西進，軸心國均需要先在政治軍事外交各方面，有所佈置。第一，西歐方面，必須先把對法關係，弄得服服貼貼，連日所傳魏剛將軍特自菲洲防地趕回本國，反對達爾朗內閣柔弱外交之說，如果屬實，則希特勒的「法德合作」政策至少已須受到相當的牽掣，更談不到如何脅迫維希政府，以從事對英作戰；他如西班牙的弗朗哥將軍也始終沒有百分之百地投入軸心懷抱，今後如何促其入彀，以代德義「在火中取栗」，至少還需要相當的努力。</p>
<p>其次，東地中海方面，克利特島雖已費盡九牛二虎之力，予以攻佔，但進攻埃及的軍事準備，似乎還嫌不夠充分；叙利亞的局勢既因法國內部尙有爭執而未能立即「明朗化」，同時土耳其乃至蘇聯的態度，也似乎還在模稜兩可之間，乖巧的希特勒當然知道投鼠忌器的明訓，吾則前此何至連已到口邊的伊拉克，都甘願「拱手讓人」？何况華維爾將軍過去之所以不以全力死守希臘，不以全力保衛克利特島者，其用意殆正在集中兵力，加强埃及和近東方面的防務，塞浦路斯島既非克利特可比，亞歷山大之久爲英國近東軍主力所在地，更爲不容吾認之事實，而德國他日唯一可以憑藉的叙利亞，又早已處於英軍三面包圍的不利形勢之下，蓋以美國的接濟，此際似乎正在經由紅海直達埃及，在此種種情勢之下，除非近東外交政治局勢發生劇變，好像還不容想像希特勒的閃電攻勢又將在那一方面迅速奏功。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，可見希特勒之必須繼續擴大攻勢，雖已毫無疑問，但是如何進攻較有把握，以及向何方進攻較易着手，似乎還在審愼討議之中，也說不定審議結果，感覺尙須在實行發動大規模軍事行動之前，多做一些準備工作，不過，時間正是他最大的敵人，因此，無論如何，他在不久的將來，必須再作一次——「閃電攻勢」即使這一攻勢將依然無關整個戰局的最後勝敗，但他爲保持威信，維繫人心，以及企圖打破長期戰的危機起見，仍將有不得不爾的苦衷。</p>
<h3>羅斯福赫爾聲明　美遠東政策不變　否認對日商訂不侵約　謂此舉實違反美國策</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨在接見新聞記者席上稱、關於外傳美·日非正式商議訂立互不侵犯條的事、彼絕無所聞、彼假定日大使野村曾與國務卿赫爾迭次會談、惟絕米接到有任何中立或不侵犯條的之報吿、據此間日人方面報吿、野村大使在最近晤商時、曾試探改善·日美交誼之可能性、但日大使館吾認報載野村有提議美。日互不侵犯條的之說、此問題並未提出、亦不擬有關於此事之談判、惟日大使館承認、野村與美官員及非官方迭次晤商之際、曾討論如何增進美·日交誼之法、至其情形、日大使館不允討論、惟他方面稱、日使試探此種睦誼事件、亦理所當然云、（七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨在新聞記者招待席上言及外傳對日談話說、謂美國在太平洋之政策始終未變云、言下顯有對日關係的任何改善繫於日政府行動之意、赫爾叉表示、美國對於日本與荷印間商業談判之注意、謂美國立塲堅決反對遠東現狀之任何變更云、記者詢以星期四日所發言論、是吾作美國準備斷絕對維希外交關係、或準備佔領法屬地之解、赫爾答稱、渠將聽令報紙自己猜測之、（七日路透社電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾稱、單獨與外國訂互不侵犯的、爲美國所反對、美國之此項政策、依然未變、赫爾並舉一九三一年蘇聯所樹之先例以資證明、蓋蘇聯亦嘗企圖與美訂互不侵犯的也、（七日國際社電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　美商業部透露、最近三月內、美汽油之輸往日本者、其總數已逾、一百萬加侖、此數已足以應日本航空之需、據稱、羅斯福總統對原料出口、雖實施禁運、但本年度油類輸日、較之已往五年，大於五倍、同時、擬運往日本之碎鐵、擱置於美國各地、等候出口執照者、已逾一年、官方對汽油輸日增加一事、發表評論曰、「美汽油之輸日、乃綏靖政策之一部分、該政策將予日本一錯誤的安全觀念、而使其放棄國積大量汽油」云、（七日國際社電）</p>
<h3>收用外船法案　美總統已簽署　約八十艘共達四十五萬噸　非經特許不得轉租交戰國</h3>

<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨簽定准政府收用在美外船的八十艘之立法案、此案規定政府得租僱任何外船、供對外或海岸業務、但苟不經總統特許、不得轉租與交戰國政府、上述外船內有西班牙船三十六艘、義船二十六艘、德船兩艘、愛沙尼亞船兩艘、立陶宛與羅馬尼亞船各一艘、又法船十四艘、（七日路透社電）　華盛頓　沒收外船案、羅斯福總統昨已簽署、該案授橡航運委員會接收擱置之外船四五〇·〇〇〇噸、沒收之船隻中包括華麗之法郵船拿門第號及其他法船十一艘、並有義·德船隻、據悉、所有船隻、將由美國駕駛、而最後將文與英國、（七日國際社電）</p>

<h3>金市轉跌為漲</h3>
<p>昨日市烚赤暗市、呆定逾恒、在極穩中、市價轉跌為漲、乃遠月美金鬆勢　不久即回平、且荷印消息不若　上日之惡化、空方稍起抵補、價晨開低盤、為六千四百三十五元、後緩步回升至六千四百五十元、終見軋升八元、全日交易一萬三四千兩、下午週六無市、現金價亦穩定、費文元售予祥和一百兩、合盛出中興二十兩德孚出順源一百兩、又出時和及新天　各五十兩、均照期交價髙二百八十五兩、亦軋升數元、　金等均平、</p>

<h3>可可與朱古律（續）</h3>
<p>— 髙劍農</p>
<p>然而當着Cortez率領着一班粗擴無議的兵士把古阿茲忒克帝國征服以後，他們驅迫着士人給他們開礦掘取黃金：這多少年來是那麼被墨西哥人所珍惜愛護勤慎培養的可可樹，　時荒廢拋棄，全被作踐了。不過後來西班牙人也認清了這樹的價值，於是反把可可完全壟斷起來，嚴禁出口，為的可大利獨吞。最後他們也把它移植到南美，又於公元一六七四年和一六八〇年兩次遠輸至菲律賓羣島，從這裏普及到印度東部和南洋群島一帶：因為這些地方的氣候相宜，移植的工作非常成功。至於葡萄牙人呢，也把可可樹傳播到非洲幾內亞灣和剛果河流域一帶，現在這些地方反成了可可最主要的供給地：譬如黃金海岸的Cortez海港，每年輸出可可約十五萬噸，本地的出產量，則是二十五萬噸。</p>
<p>培植可可樹的工作是非常麻煩和艱苦的：它需要常年有攝氏二十七度的氣溫，極豐富的雨量，極肥沃的土地；它又怕烈日和暴風，所以必需有蔭影把它遮蔽起來。平常人是把它栽種在低濕的山谷裏；要是在毫無遮攔的平地上呢，就利用更髙大的香蕉樹等當它的護符。它長到三年後纔開始開花，不過人總是把它們斫去，一直等到第五年頭上：這時它開始結果子了，往後能供給多量的收獲到二十五年或三十年，可可樹的花是一年常開的，不過人採取可可，卻只在六月和十二月每年舉行兩次。</p>
<p>可可的服食法，譬如沖茶喝，溶化在牛奶裏吃等，已經是家喻戶曉，不必去多叙述它；可是對於它製造「朱古律」糖的演變和進化，卻不能默而不言的不稍為介紹一下。說起古墨西哥人對於可可的吃法，那不但不能動我們的食指，惹我們的饞涎，恐怕反要叫我們聞而喪胆，見而失魄的了！原來他們吃時是把可可焙炙了，研成細粉，混合在玉蜀黍麵裏，熬成漿糊的樣子，－－又一種「湖塗！」－－然後加上重量的……辣椒，大批的胡椒！這紅褐色的糊塗，就是古墨西哥人所最喜愛，最常吃的原始「朱古律！」啊這東西，我想可以按照古墨西哥人原來的字音Tchocolatl譯作「抽口辣，」或按照西班牙文或法文的chocolat譯作「收口辣：」無論怎樣吧，這傢伙的辣勁，一定是我們吃不消的。然而墨西哥人是那麼嗜痂成癖，是那麼狂熱的擁護它，以致有Chia　pa城的天主教信徒，寧可同天主教斷絕了關係，因為那城的天主教願欲禁止他們在參加宗教的儀式時吃他們那寶貴的「抽口辣！」</p>
<p>荘嚴一點的說吧：朱古律所以能成為現在人人愛吃的東西，實在是西班牙人的發明，因為這必需知道糖的利用啊。西班牙人不特在裏面加上蔗糖，且在裏面攙上香料，如同凡尼拉（Vanille）豆，一種叫Orjeval的花，甚至龍涎和麝香。這種仍因墨西哥人舊名的「朱古律」糖，首先傳入西班牙去，也不由的大出風頭起來。不過它的價值是非常的昂貴，多少年來只有王公貴族能夠偶一梁指罷了，平民是沒有口福能親炙這纔堪稱得起　漿玉液的「神糧」哩。公元一六五一年，朱古律初次傳入法國：那時候路易十四正在童年，由太後奧國亞納（Anne　d'Autrich）攝政，太後也立刻垂青寵愛了這甘美的食品，叫它名馳遐邇。一六五九年路易十四和西班牙公主瑪利亞德勒撤結婚：這熱騰香甜的朱古律融液，又在富麗堂皇的王宮華筵上同多數的貴族士女相見，也更進一步的深入社會層中。從一七一五年到一七二三年的法國攝政斐理伯，更是嗜之成癖，大量享用。然而這時它如同在西班牙一樣：因為身價過於高貴，不可響邇，還只是趨奉朱門，作富豪貴族的點綴品罷了。是在這一時期，醫生們在朱古律裏加進許多滋補的藥品，而且也由漿糊改成丸粒的樣子，謊稱它是什麼補陰壯陽的妙藥，以致天主公教貶稱朱古律為「魔食！」—－卻是可以和作對。一—於是普通的朱古律，為的同道醫藥上用的朱古律相別，就冠上「康健」字樣，稱為「康健朱古律。」總結一句：起初的朱古律是漿糊狀，是「湖塗，」它所以變成為現在的塊狀或丸狀，實是由醫生們的加以改良進步而來。</p>
<p>朱古律雖說沒有咖啡那種提神助興的特別效能，卻也是一種極好看食品，況說它那香甜的滋味，比起那苦澀的咖啡，當然更受多數人的歡迎。它的銷路既然日廣，於是就有特設專店以從事大批製造的：法國的第一座朱古律糖店創設於一七七六年，名叫Grand　d,Aussy。然而這座店大概不是為圖謀民眾幸福而設立的，因為它還帶著「王家」朱古律店的稱號呢！經後又經過多少年，因為可可的供給增多，蔗糖的大批生產，價值低廉，於是朱古律也一換其從前專門趨奉貴族的面目，而自貶身價藹然同我們這一般民眾日相親近起來。現在呢，只要我們願意花上不多的代價，就也可以一嘗這「神糧」的滋味了。</p>

<h3>證券　公債盤低</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市一度趨堅、旋即漸漸回疲、一則空方抵補漸稀、大戶多頭漸感滿足、更以戰事方面咸云稍覺不利、同康賣出愈來愈湧、人心稍形恍惚、目下趨勢免引起回風、大漲小回、此亦曲綫應有之途徑、昨為週六祇做一盤、先將隔日下午交易交割清楚、以便銀行之收解、於上午十一時開盤、鴻大仍有買進、初開再漲二三角、同康湧出信孚生大又有買進、聯益怡泰又有出範、久豐九成均出賣出、雖有聯和潤德買進但不勝其高壓、各種乃緩緩回軟、多方難尚從事拉抬、但為力祇及丙種、故仍　維持原價收盤、收後暗盤仍小一二角、結果除丙種仍保持原價外、餘均小去三五角、成交數目約有二三十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、表格</p>

<h3>紗花　單紗港銷忽動　雙馬期現徘徊</h3>
<p>紗市不離徘徊之境、上下範圍、殊形狹窄、終日之升降、竟在三四元之間、可想市場上清澹之一般矣、至於現紗交易又滯、惟三二支單紗港幣忽見起色、買去二百三十五包、於是有一部份向業中、鑒於該紗銷路活動、大家拖進、作未雨綢繆之計者甚多、所以單紗價漲二十元、二十支及十支粗紗未曾採辦也、二十支雙馬高價一千四百二十八元、低價為一千四百二十三元、午後因週末關係、未聞做開行市、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、市態異常呆滯、首盤價為一千四百二十六元、但櫃面上成交寥寥、有一部份因荷印問題而賣出、少頃跌至一千四百二十三元、盈利者稍扒補、又復回昂至一千四百二十七八元、在此價廻旋約有一二小時之久、然場中交易大為清淡、大都均抱觀望態度、而勿動生氣、迨至收盤價為一千四百二十七元、查半日間成交統計四千六百三十五包、茲將各幣口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>香港二三五　同行四、四〇〇統計四、六三五</p>
<p>金雙馬標準期紗市況、益覺清淡、上落殊狹、此因人心怠懈之故、大家觀望不前也、查七月期價此上日漲五角、八月期漲三元、午後因週六停拍、上午成交約計二三千包、茲將其收盤價格列左、</p>
<h3>巴西棉續有成交　印棉到二百九十二件</h3>
<p>現棉情況、安靜如恒、惟粗絨棉走勢較　、細絨棉因出口交易不斷、市態甚昂也、</p>
<p>另訊滬埠洋行外棉交易、良以客　採辦現紗較勤、同時滬埠外棉存底漸感缺乏、而目下來源並不十分通暢、因之各方頗具購意、市況亦有起色、連日各同業與廠方皆有不少巴西棉成交、市價較前又略漲二三元左右也、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、市況平靜而不定至收盤時突因同業買進、及空頭抵補而　、昨日收盤價格、挺進四至十磅　不等、</p>
<p>又電、去年八月一日起、至今年六月六日止、美棉統計錄左、（每包五百磅）</p>
<p>印度棉市、先因投機者買進、及空頭抵補而漲、但續後又因歐洲出口商售出、及多頭了結而稍跌、結果收盤價格、約漲一羅比左右、又預測今日開盤市況、漲〇·七五羅比、</p>
<p>外棉來滬、近來大見減少、昨日怡和洋行明生輪、由香港裝來印棉二百九十二件、停靠羅斯福碼頭起缷、（年）</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價較緊　期貨依然停市</h3>
<p>昨日糖市僅有現貨交易、趨勢較緊、期貨因會議後尚無解決辦法、繼續停市、公會劃盤、現貨　四粗白三月份到貨九十三元、無上落、四月份到九十三元半、五月份新貨九十四元、升五角、荷赤新貨七十一元、太古車白Ｂ嘜東棧一百〇六元、升一元二角、ＤＹ嘜西棧九十五元、升一元、ＨＸ嘜仍九十一元、本廠雪白九十六元、振記四號綿白八十六元、本一號冰一百二十四元半、晶明冰一百二十六元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　海南圓肉略升</h3>
<p>海南圓肉、近乏續到、號貨大都不肯隨市缷兌、故市勢仍緊、昨有小數開出價為二百五十元又千三元、北市號家有叫二百六十元者、可見有續緊之象、</p>
<h3>煤炭　淮南煤交易稀</h3>
<p>淮南烟煤、上月間去路尚暢、而各地來貨亦不絕、近來似頗沉寂、良以需求者納胃漸足、交易轉懈、昨日祇有少數做開、同業拆價、篩塊每噸兩百八十五元、揀塊三百零五元、煤屑二百五十元、棧忙自車行槓另加、</p>

<h3>葉材　金銀花獻新</h3>
<p>金銀花現屆出　、首批已有運到一批、因產價高昂、兼之匯水關係、成本極高、故號方叫盤比較行方按價須差百元之譜、尚未開出、</p>
<h3>疋頭　大衣呢布氣特緊</h3>
<p>大衣呢市面、昨日氣象特緊、開價莫不狂喊亂抬因觀市貨存底枯薄、到貨難有、而漫無標準、誤期延遲與不能運到必占所定者三分之二以上、加之歐美局勢趨緊、往後運到更艱、致人心莫不看高居奇、但大衣呢類、本廠貨均不能紡織、故同業中人、大半齊多提早下手購辦、因之市氣特別俏緊而高漲、昨美豐大衣呢、每碼開售六十元、（舊臘祇售三十二三元）、波蘭倒純毛大衣呢開沽八十元、（舊祇售四十五六元）、開士面福泰大衣呢開售一百五十元、（舊祇售九十五六元）、七〇七平厚呢開售二十八九元、（舊祇售二十元左右）、</p>

<h3>美遠東政策不變　對華作實際援助　日苦師老無功遷怒於美　但華盛頓已作事實答復</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報社評云、本埠日文報每日新聞及大陸新報木星期曾發表論文、據稱、美國一部份人士、不願美政府繼續援華、其理由謂、美國援華行動、將引起太平洋戰爭、並因此而阻碍美國對英國之接濟云、</p>
<p>接濟中國繼續不斷</p>
<p>如果該項論文、係代表日本整個報界及今日日本人之思想、則此適足以反映日本不能明瞭美國今日所有之精神與情緒、蓋美國早已向東京明白表示、美國決不停止援華、藉以綏靖日本、今重慶已獲得美國之接濟、且將繼續不斷也、</p>
<p>固定政策決難改變</p>
<p>日本對美國若自願緩和其態度、美國當然不加反對、但美國決不因日本改變政策而抱騎牆態度、東京若更認爲日本之紙上空談、即足使美國出賣中國之合法政府、則直爲夢想耳、吾人非閉門造車、憑空說話、若日本友人能一讀此間所收到之五月十二日紐約日報社論、當可瞭然矣、</p>
<p>戰事延長咎由自取</p>
<p>該社論略稱一中日戰爭現已獲確切之新轉機、此種轉機、足引起全世界擁護民治國家者之自豪與希望、上星期日木報紙已有驚人坦白之宣稱、謂征服中國實爲不可能之事、本多報吿稱、蔣介石已接受美國之　願、爲民治國家作戰、並出羅斯福對之提供保證、美國決援助之、日本官員聞訊、表示忿怒莫名、竟指稱美國阻止中日和平、又謂、美國對華之援助、適足便戰爭延長、殊不知日本對華之戰爭、本爲咎由自取、而將自食其果、</p>
<p>東方領袖加倍努力</p>
<p>蔣介石將軍顯然非孤獨無援者、此世界民治運動之東方領袖、已加倍努力、吾人對此甚爲欣慰、吾人所引爲遺憾者、爲吾人除空言援助及少許金錢之接濟外、尙無具體之實際援助、吾人必須加倍努力、停止油類出售與日本、並增加對重慶之援助、日本以爲吾人阻止和平而移怒於吾人、實乃欲誘使吾人向其綏靖、吾人當以事實拒絕之、固不能徒　空言也、</p>
<p>聯盟邁進爭取自由</p>
<p>吾人必須使世界民治國家實現聯盟、爲永久之聯盟而非暫時利用少聯盟、吾人所受之威脅、說明此種聯盟之必要、吾人强於孤立派與失敗論者甚多、吾人之實力、儘足以可能之援助伸之東西兩大洋、以挽救自山、</p>

<p>現正計畫補充設備</p>
<p>美籟院長海靜格頃稱、該院工作、不致因失却設備而停頓、醫治工作、昨仍賡續進行、但須設法獲取若干設備、俾得工作不輟云、據傳上海醫院被運去之設備、前係南市市立醫院所有、八一三戰起、託國際紅十字會保管、旋復轉借予上海醫院、該院曾簽訂文件規定此項設備決不移交他方、以待日後歸還華當局、</p>

<h3>怎樣應付考試</h3>
<p>— 楊春綠</p>
<p>學期快要結束了！小朋友又在忙着應付這將到的學期考試了。</p>
<p>我們不論做什麼事，事前一定要有相當的準備，才能獲得圓滿的結果。應付考試，也是如此；在考試以前，必須有充分的準備。最好依照校裏規定的考試日程，和各科的性質程度，自己預訂一個溫習的時間表。但是須要有一個限度，就是不妨碍身體的健康爲原則，休息的時間，是萬萬不能缺少的。如考試的前夕，還開夜東，第二天你的精神便不好了，甚至會生起病　，那是冬麼不上算呀！在溫書的時候，要能抓住要領，自已找出問題來。或者集合幾個同學，相互討論，更能使你明瞭得透澈些。</p>
<p>到考試的時候，最怕的是慌張。如果臨考心慌，就是容易的題目，也要變做難題了。所以拿試卷之後，切勿急急動手，應該先略看一遍，把容易做的先做，較難的題目，仔細想過後再做。做不出的，寗可不做，不要偷看書本，或抄襲人家，那是最不道德的行爲。要是給敎師看到了，還要受到嚴厲的處罰咧！等到完全做好以後，如有多餘的時間，自己再複看遍，看看有錯誤沒有，切勿急於搶交卷。此外，還要注意考卷的整潔，字跡要寫得端正，這是同你的成績很有關係的。</p>
<p>考試　不是什麼難事，也不是什麼苦事，只要你能平日用心學習，臨考冉加複習整理，便不難應付裕如了。小朋友們！祝你們考試勝利！</p>
<h3>兒童健康實騐所</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>小朋友們！這裹有一個好消息吿訴你們，便是各界的名流，最近在杳港創辦了一個兒童健康試騐所。這個機關，顧名思議，是一個保障兒童生命，促進兒童健康的　關</p>
<p>大家知道，兒童是國家的主人翁，將來新中國的建設，道重擔就擱在兒童的身上。然而要求今日的兒童，他年能挑上這副重擔，那就除了智力方面須十二分的充足外，還得要有健全的體格。所以今日對於兒童的訓練，丟開智德，體育是特別軍要，吾則就是有了充分的才智，以不健全的體格，去負建設新中國的　擔，也是不可能的。這原因，近世歐美各國，對於兄童健康問題非常重視，用種種方法，來促進兒童的健康。</p>
<p>遠在一九三七年，中央振濟委員會代委員長許世英氏，首先贊助發起，着手辦理中國兒童健康實騐站。後因中日戰爭爆發，工作就此停頓。到了最近在香港的各界名流內中有一部分是當初的發起人，看到兒童健康的實騐，與民族健康及戰後人口的補充有莫大關係，特於日前召集發起會議，繼續進行工作，積積極促　實現，並更名爲中國兒童健康實騐听。</p>
<p>等到兒童健康實騐所正式成立之後，照預定的計劃，工作方面，分實騐，　兒，出版，服務四種。大致實騐方面，在用實騐的方法，以騐兒童的健康是否增進。出版是刋印各種有關兒童健康的書報雜誌。托兒爲闢辦托兒所。服務爲有關兒章健康的服務，如醫藥，種痘，防疫等等。一旦正式成立分所遍及全中國各地後，那一般兒童，將獲益非淺，委實是福音呢！</p>
<h3>賣冰童子</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>季節吿訴我們，又已達進了酷熱的夏大了。街　，弄尾，又將平添了一批川流不息，沿途叫賣的「小商人」。小朋友們，試猜猜看，究竟是那一批小商人呢？</p>
<p>他們：這一羣露天小商人，衣，履不全，有的還赤了膊，赤了脚，肩頭上掛了一隻布袋或小木箱子，裏面藏着許多「冰」，小小的嘴脣爿，一張，一翕，一路狂喊着：「冰啊！冰啊！賣冰啊！」在烈日的暴晒下，奔走十里，廿里路，是不算什麼一回事。這小小的「賣冰童子！」他們爲了要找飯吃，要幫助父母的生計，所以這樣不辭勞苦的奔波烈日之下，那種「自食其力」的精神，是多麼可敬！安樂享福的小朋友們，你們也有「自食共力」的志氣嗎？不　什麼行業，只要能够自食其力，不怕吃苦，終有一朝飛黃騰達的啊！你們牢記着努力攻讀。充實你們無形的資本（學問和技能）吧。</p>
<h3>蠶的種種機能</h3>
<p>— 褐夫</p>
<p>小朋友們！我知道你們養蠶的一定小少，但是隨便抓住一位小朋友，問問，蠶怎麼會吐絲？蠶爲什麼作繭？作繭你爲什麼變成蠶蛾？恐怕沒有一個小朋友回答得出的。小朋友只知道蠶好像在「變戲法」，而且以爲它很希奇。其實這個一點也不希奇的。它也是動物中之一類，蠶是幼蟲，有十二個單眼分佈在二側。它有眼睛，但是沒有耳鼻等器管。它有五對足，有九對呼吸的氣門。它也有心臓，血液，胃和腸，但是血液不含紅血球，故不呈紅色。它沒有腦，但是在喉頭，胸部和腹部有砷經節。外面一層堅硬的皮，就是它的骨骼。最後，因爲它有一種特別的器管—絲腺，這是別種動物所沒有的，它所以能吐絲全靠它的絲腺。絲腺是一種膠狀的液體，吐出來時，遇見空氣，便堅硬成絲。</p>
<p>蠶從蛻化卵的時候，身上有毛。普通蠶要蛻皮四次，方才會吐絲作繭，把自已裏在裹面，後來成蛹，蛹是不食不動的，經休眠後，再蛻皮成六足叫翅的蠶蛾（成蟲）。蠶蛾的全體生着很細的鱗片，顏色白，翅上常有黃褐色斑紋。蠶蛾不吃東西，產卵後，不久就死去了。</p>
<p>蠶—在幼蟲時代，以求食爲主，而爲營養體。因幼蟲的薄命很短，須要傳種接代，所以吐絲作繭成蠶蛾，在成蟲時代不吃東西，所產卵爲主，而爲生殖體。蠶所以要吐絲作繭，即爲了　代的關係。</p>
<h3>水的清潔法</h3>
<p>— 希旦</p>
<p>我們喝的水，是在幾百年前地球開闢時的「原始水」什麼叫做「原始水」？原始水就是氫氣二分和氧氣分化合而成的。純潔的水是無色無臭而透明的液體：水的淸潔，可用下法證明：</p>
<p>（一）觀水色法：把一只玻璃盃，在盃底放一小塊白紙，倒些水在盃裏，我們從上面看，如水裹呈現色彩，或是混濁的，就不能喝。</p>
<p>（二）嗅覺法：把水煮到沸騰，仔細聞聞，如有臭味，就不能喝。</p>
<p>（三）沉澱法：把茶盃裹倒滿冷水，靜一晝夜，如果盃底現　色，也不是純潔的水。</p>
<p>（四）藥紙試騐法：把藍色或是白色試紙，放在水裏，如果試　不　色，就是純潔的水；變了顏色就不能喝。</p>
<h3>為什麼不要隨地吐痰？</h3>
<p>— 梅勤</p>
<p>阿林放學回家看見　杆木上貼着一張紙，上寫小要隨地吐痰的字樣，阿林在學校裹常常聽見老師說不要隨地吐痰，吐痰是惡習慣，但對於不要隨地吐痰的原因還一些也不明白，這次阿林見了這張紙後，立刻感覺何不去問三哥呢？阿林三到家裹立刻丟下書包去尋三哥，問他爲什麼不要隨地吐痰的原因。三哥遇到阿林問的問題，無有不詳細解釋的，這决當然也不例外，於是三哥拉了阿林的手，一起坐在園子裹的長凳上，三哥開始回答這問題了。</p>
<p>大凡患肺癆的人，痰中難免含有一種破壞力極强的細菌，叫肺結核菌，它能使正常的肺破壞得無用，不能呼吸，如果患這種病的人把痰隨意吐在地上，經過烈日的曝曬之後，肺結核菌便飛揚於空中了，人們呼吸時它使乘機進人肺內，幹那破壞人的生命的勾當。每年因此而息肺癆的人不知凡幾，因而死亡的也不知多少！你想這是冬麼可怕的結果啊！所以在路上切不可隨意吐痰」</p>
<h3>蛋殼手工</h3>
<p>— 芝</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們做過剪紙貼紙手工，也做過竹工木工，但的做過蛋殼手工嗎？吿訴你，蛋殼手工，又好玩，又經濟，假使手工是要練習手藝細心的話，做蛋殼手工會有更大的收獲。</p>
<p>假如你要學做的話，不要忘記告訴你的媽媽，在燒荷包蛋的時候，把蛋交給你敲破，我來吿訴你怎樣敲法：</p>
<p>（一）在蛋的無論那一端敲一小洞，讓蛋黃蛋白流出，把蛋殼洗凈，便可工作了，假使兩端敲破剪平，糊上紙，繪上彩色，可以做小鼓，以火柴棒塗顏色做鼓槌鼓架，非常神氣，或者剪平一頭用彩色繪山水人物花卉，以花紙作架子，可作牙籤瓶，精緻悅目。</p>
<p>（二）在蛋的側面敲洞，流出黃白，剪平，繪上花卉做在搖籃，以彩色絲綫纏好的鉛條繞成搖籃架子，用絲綫在蛋兩端的緣邊穿孔縛在架上，左右擺動，非常好玩，假使有小洋囡囡睡在裏面，更是像眞，還可在殼上繪上魚鱗魚眼，剪紙作鰭，貼在背腹尾各部，更活像一條金魚。</p>
<p>除了以上四種，還可作不倒翁，花瓶，花籃，水盂等等，隨意製造，只小忘記兩點。。（一）蛋殼要洗凈，吾則繪不上彩色，（二）先在熱水中浸過再剪，以免破裂。小朋友們，星期日無事何不試一試呢，</p>
<h3>冷氣</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>天一熱，各電影院登在報紙上的廣吿，都用「冷氣開放」字樣，排在很明顯的地位，來招徠遊客和觀衆。的確，在上海，祇要有錢，決不會嘗到炎熱和寒冷的苦味，因爲夏天可放冷氣，冬天可裝水汀，終年溫暖如春，眞是個人間的天堂。</p>
<p>阿慧對着「冷氣」兩個字在發怔。「冷氣當然是冷的空氣，爲什麼在電影院中才有？我們上自然課的時候，那位先生會說過：空氣是什麼地方都有的。那麼冷氣空氣當然也是空氣，爲什麼都被電影院中收去了，反使我們的家裹充滿了熱氣。」他這樣的自言自語着，却被他的哥哥——阿明聽到了，他便笑得合不攏口來，並且還說阿慧有點傻。</p>
<p>「哥哥，你說我傻，到底傻在什麼地方？我覺得剛才所說的話，一些也不錯，你為什麼笑起來了？」阿明的一笑，當然合不攏口來，並且還說阿慧有點傻。</p>
<p>「冷氣在夏天不是隨便什麼人都能享受的。要知道在電影院裹裝着一架很複雜的機器，每天用電來發動，便把空氣製造成一定的冷度，結且耗費電量很多，所以今年電力公司因煤的來源缺乏，想把不必要的用電，停止供給，後來不知怎的，又把這計劃取消了，所以今年的各大電影院裏仍有冷氣。那麼冷氣怎樣製成的呢：要解釋這個問題，必先要知道水的特性，因爲冷氣的製成，完全根據水的有這種特性，再製造成這架裂冷氣的機器。煮沸水，祗要把水熱到華氏寒暑表二百十二度便行，但在高山上，不到二百十二度，水已煮沸了，從這個實騐上可以知道，水的沸點不老是二百十二度，而隨空氣的壓力有仲縮的，如氣壓大，沸點便高，反過來說，氣壓小，沸點低，所以在高山上的氣壓，當然比了地面來得低，因此不必熱到這溫度，便可把水煮沸。而冷氣就利用這特性。在一隻密封的鍋中，放滿了水，用抽氣機抽云裹面的空氣，水所受的壓力變小，沸點便不需到二百十二度，要是把空氣完全抽去，鍋中變成眞空，水煮到華氏六十度就沸，於是把這種水抽到屋中來，可使屋中的空氣變冷，因爲在六十度沸騰的水，並沒有熱氣發生，但沸騰時必需熱，它便向空氣中的熱來討取，因此屋中的熱完全被它吸去，那時就變成凉爽，但在屎中更需有調節的機器，使空氣的溫度保持在華氏七十度左右，而且空氣時常流通，不含一些塵埃雜物，就可沒有特殊的臭味。其實在夏天，多出些汙，只要一洗浴，就很舒適暢快，如在夏天不出汙，便有生病的危險。在有冷氣的電影院中，一時雖覺得很凉爽，如果一出了電影院，反覺悶熱不堪，如一直晒在日光下，倒也不覺得如何的熱，這樣一冷一熱，最易傷風，對於身體當然是不利的。」</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>談談今日的申曲界</h3>
<p>— 茜蒂</p>
<p>今日的上海申曲界，似乎也正在發動新的運動，開闢新的路錢，展露　的恣態。我們對於那些熱心提倡申曲，改良申曲的藝人們，是應該表示十仆欣慰與無限的敬意的。因爲申曲之在上海，有普遍的潛勢力，牠握着大量的觀衆，而這些觀衆，又多屬於中下層階段。如果以一般的衡量說，除了電影與平劇以外，大概就要輪到巾曲了，</p>
<p>現在上海出演的申曲班子有新世界申曲塲，　先施，永安，大新，大世界，新都，大中華，東方，以及皇后劇社等。「新世界」，「光施」，「永安」，「大新」，「大世界」這四個塲子，都是附設在淤藝塲裏的，他們只拿取塲方給予的包銀，雖　觀衆在進塲時，仍須另行買票。「新都」，「大中華」，「東方」，「皇后」這四個塲子，都自成獨立劇團。「新都」的領導者，是此刻正爲某影片公司雜致着拍揶「閻瑞生」影片的施春軒：「施家班」在過去，很有一點歷史，施君不僅是個藝人，而且胸中也頗有經綸，他唱來的戲，具文化氣息，應屬於劉春山·張冶兒一派，專以「挖苦駡人」勝人，而　得多數觀衆之口碑載道。「大中華」的領導者，是筱文濱和王筱新，筱君曾上過銀幕，「賢慧的媳婦，」是共處女作，「恨海難填」爲共第一砲，而且唱片公司也要請他灌唱片，他在今日的申曲界，可稱謂第一流紅的，然而我們爲他惋惜的是，他唱來唱去，總是「雪夜孤女」，「再生夫妻」那一套，並無新的精神，將來恐難免有淘汰的危險。「東方」的領導者是衛嗚岐和石筱英，衛君富有演戲天才，唱詞臺步，與衆不同，在申曲界另成一派。最後要說到「皇后」了。「皇后」非常年輕，朝氣勃勃，完全以另一種新的姿態出現，現在擁有的演員陣容，相當堅强，上過銀幕而爲與論界推崇的王雅琴，即爲該劇社之領導者。他們走的路綫，是想惟申曲電影化，譬如最近排演過的「孔雀東南飛」，「</p>
<h3>藍蘭退隱</h3>
<p>— 海星</p>
<p>藍蘭突有退隱之意，告記者謂：自下星期一起將不登臺，因肋骨處突長一瘤，且有肋膜炎之微象，遵醫生之囑，不得不暫告休息。按藍蘭於戰後從事舞臺工作，賣力殊甚，且共演技已臻爐火純靑，而於銀幕上予觀衆亦有良好印象，一旦退隱，是藝壇一損失身。馬路天使」，以及不久即將上演的「斷腸花」等，差不多都是從銀幕上搬下來的，新劇界如岳楓，梅熹，陸沉，戈戈等，都全力參加，分任編導等工作，共他對於演員的化裝，舞臺的佈景，燈光的配置，也另請專家擔任。</p>
<p>申曲界的近况，大概如此。這裹我倒想起子雲劇團的領導者　子雲的一席話來了，他說：</p>
<p>「唱申曲難，在此時此地唱申曲更難，因爲我們一方要　到環境，一面又要赤誠地拿出自已的良心來，既不能少說一句話，又不放多說一句話。」</p>
<p>這話說得很對。然而我也有希望於申曲界諸藝人者：</p>
<p>「我們要咬緊牙齒，度過這困苦的難　，利慾不能誘，威武不可屈，始終是站在爲藝　　藝術的本位上，努力奮鬭！你們在臺上的時候，勸人以孝也好，勸人以忠也好，勸人以堅定意志保守氣節更好，總之是不要含毒素，不要殺害觀眾們的身心。</p>

<h3>國聯攝「美人島」</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>時裝電影旣已在上海的影壇重新抬頭後，各公司製片的方針，立刻傾向到以現實作題材的新作風了，雖然，那在戰前，這種傾向的風氣更濃厚的</p>
<p>當然，我們還是欣慰整個影壇能從所謂民間電影的漩渦中間自拔出來，而在更進一步的熱望里，願時裝電影的題村範圍廣泛，不必再套男女之問羅曼史的公式化，這時代，這社會，這人類，血腥的故車正多着呢！</p>
<p>吳永剛的「鐵窗紅淚」，正因題材現實，　到廣大觀衆的激賞，所以岳楓在「碧海靑天」後的「月缺花殘」，也是一部暴露現社會黑暗的骨與血凝成的刺激作品。</p>
<p>「月缺花殘」一星期後就要開拍，岳風連日正在忙碌分鏡頭的工作。</p>
<p>正在這時，國聯公司當局，又付與岳楓一部時裝的劇本，劇名「美人島」，請他經渦改編，繼「月缺花殘」後攝製。</p>
<p>「美人島」的劇名，似乎軟性一些，但據閱過劇本者說：內容正富激昂的正義感，描寫着南洋羣島僑胞的一個愛國故事呢！</p>
<p>期待着吧：有骨有血的時裝電影，將要使寂寞的影壇開放燦爛的怒花！</p>

<p>第十章　公孫劍氣初第一</p>
<p>等到他們上山時，東方已白，二人跑得一身汁。柳隱英恐防伊姑母早起，心裏十分發急。一到家門，二人輕輕躍入，各歸自己室中，一些沒有聲息。許靖回到房裏，當然也小能冉睡了，將赤鳳寳劍懸在壁上，重換衣服，坐在那裹，細細思量適間的事，再巧也沒有，柳隱英竞會跟着自己到王家去的。又恰逢刺客，被他捉住，無怪王永泰欽佩他了。至於自己的本領，實在太差，怎麼柳隱英跟在我背後，以及竊去寳劍，我竟始終沒有覺察呢？柳隱英的本領眞是可敬，而他的爲人又是溫文有禮，像這種朋友可愛極了。想不到我在王家受了一次應折，却多認識一位英雄。若和張蒼虬相較，一則雄莽有餘，一則嫵媚可愛，都是我的畏友，我許靖何幸而遇此呢？他想了多時，忽聽柳隱英在門上剝啄兩下，連喚「靖哥靖哥起來嗎？」許靖頓時如夢初醒，連忙立起身去，開了房鬥。柳隱英已換了裝束，　許靖帶笑說道：「只差一刻時候，我姑母已起身了。靖哥爲什麽不開門？小弟以爲你又酣睡，所以喚你數聲呢。」許靖道：「昨夜我來回走了不少路，甚覺疲乏，故坐着休息。賢弟的本領實在高妙，遠勝於我，令人望塵莫及，以後我倒要時時向你討敎哩。可喜可賀。」柳隱英微微一笑道：「天下能人很多，如小弟眞是滄海一粟，何足道哉？」兩人遂並坐着詳談咋夜的事。柳隱英又叩詢許靖和王永泰以前的事。許靖遂一一實說，且向柳隱英道歉，說初時不欲將此事在人前宣揚，所以對賢弟說了謊言，還請恕宥。柳隱英嘆道：「讒人之言最是聽不得，我也不能不怪王永泰的鹵莽，幾致寃枉好人，母怪靖哥要這樣做了。此事甚爲爽快，事實勝於雄辯，王、永泰現在可明白了。（八四）</p>

<h3>Hua Army in Eastern Zhejiang Recaptures Xiangshan City; Japanese Army Flees Southward in Defeat; Hua Army Pursues Victory; Fierce Fighting Still Occurring in the Northern Mountainous Areas of the Jiyuan Highway</h3>
<p>A certain location in Eastern Zhejiang: The Japanese army, which had been harassing Xiangshan from Shipu, was counterattacked by the Hua army and collapsed due to being unable to withstand the assault. The Hua army recaptured Xiangshan City on the 5th. The Japanese army retreated in defeat to Nanping, and the Hua army is still in pursuit. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji: In the mountainous area north of the Jiyuan Highway, fierce fighting between the Hua and Japanese armies continues. The Hua army has achieved considerable victories. In the various strongholds along the river west of Guanyang, the Japanese army has been engaged in daily cross-river battles with the Hua army. Another unit of the Japanese army advanced towards Qinshui, where it was intercepted by a certain unit of the Hua army, resulting in intense combat. Furthermore, in areas such as Xinjiang, Hejin, Wanquan, Wenxi, and Zhaidian, the Japanese army, having amassed over 2,000 troops, launched an offensive on the 29th against Jijiwang Mountain, Sanjiao, Qinghe Town, Liuyu, and Yangwang areas. The Hua army launched separate counterattacks and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Malayan Authorities Expel Kuomintang Members</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A certain prominent Chinese businessman who recently traveled to various parts of Southeast Asia stated that if the British authorities in Malaya hope to gain the cooperation of overseas Chinese in the defense of Malaya, they must change their policy towards overseas Chinese in Malaya. The British authorities there regard Kuomintang members as radicals and expel them, but allow genuine communists to remain in the country and engage in activities among overseas Chinese. It should be understood that the Kuomintang is the ruling party in China, and the Chongqing government is cooperating with Britain. Therefore, the British authorities in Malaya should allow the Kuomintang to exist in Malaya in order to assist the local authorities in suppressing communist elements. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Multiple Japanese Aircraft Raid Chongqing Again Yesterday; Major Fires Erupt on Both Sides of Ximen Main Street; One Japanese Aircraft Sustains Heavy Damage</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Just after noon today, 27 Japanese aircraft dropped incendiary bombs in the lower city area, causing major fires to erupt on both sides of Ximen Main Street. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's office has been destroyed by the fire. The Xinmin Daily, which has the widest circulation among students, was also affected by the fire. Bombs fell in Consulate Lane, destroying a dormitory of the Women's and Youth Association. With fires on both sides of the main street, traffic from Ximen to the lower city was temporarily disrupted. After the air raid, a Japanese reconnaissance plane circled over Chongqing. Anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely. The air raid alarm was issued at 12:10 PM and lifted at 3:00 PM. Multiple bombs fell in the central district, causing one fire. One heavy bomb created a large crater, disrupting traffic. It has now been learned that among the 700 people who suffocated in the tunnel during the air raid on Thursday night, 400,000 yuan in banknotes and 200 taels of gold were found. The authorities have fully registered the money of the victims so that relatives can claim it. Several small shops near the tunnel, where entire families were found dead, are deserted and without owners today. All newspapers today have editorials with strong language, demanding that officials responsible for this tragedy be held accountable and that the management of shelters in various locations be improved. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Thirteen Japanese bombers dropped 400 bombs and incendiary bombs on the commercial district in downtown Chongqing and on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, a few miles from the US Embassy, at 1:40 PM today. The damage was more severe than any other raid Chongqing has suffered this year. The British Embassy was bombed for the second time this week. On Monday, the British Embassy was hit by six bombs. This time, however, it was not as severe as on Monday, with only one bomb falling, slightly damaging the British Ambassador's office and the residences of embassy staff. The doors, windows, and furniture of the main office also sustained considerable damage. Several bombs also exploded in Consulate Lane near the British Embassy. There were at least six fires, two of which were in the west of the city. A major fire destroyed all the buildings on a major commercial street, including the offices of Eurasia Aviation Corporation and Xinmin Daily. This air raid was the fourth this week. After the bombing, several Chinese planes, believed to be pursuit planes, flew over the city, followed by the sound of machine guns, believed to be Chinese planes fighting over the southern bank. The commercial area in the city was the most severely damaged. This area, which was completely destroyed by bombing two years ago, has been destroyed three times in the past two years. The area where the air raid shelter tragedy occurred on Thursday night was attacked by Japanese planes for the first time this month. The alarm was issued at noon, and Japanese planes arrived at 1:40 PM, dropping bombs until 2:00 PM, when the alarm was lifted. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, 32 Japanese aircraft, 27 in the first group and 5 in the second, raided Chongqing. They entered the city's airspace at approximately 1:00 PM, dropped over a hundred bombs, and then fled eastward. Five of them went to Jiangjin and then returned to the city's airspace, strafing with machine guns. When the Japanese aircraft entered the city's airspace, the Hua air defense forces responded with fierce fire. It was observed that one Japanese aircraft sustained heavy damage and barely managed to escape. Over a hundred houses were destroyed in Hua, and there were a total of 13 casualties.

<h3>Official Order for Thorough Investigation of Air Raid Shelter Tragedy</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Regarding the air raid shelter tragedy on Thursday night, which resulted in 461 civilian deaths and 291 serious injuries, the authorities have ordered a thorough investigation into the cause of the disaster. All newspapers today unanimously protested against this incident of disregarding human life. Mayor Wu Guozhen, in a special meeting of the City Council, proposed that the government thoroughly investigate the cause of the inadequate air circulation within the shelter, which led to the suffocation of many people. The Ta Kung Pao called for severe punishment of those responsible, while the Catholic newspaper Social Welfare Daily stated that the actual number of deaths was more than 461. It is also understood that President Chiang Kai-shek is paying close attention to the tragedy and has ordered a thorough investigation. He personally inspected the air raid shelter where the incident occurred yesterday. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Official information released today stated that during the Japanese air raid on Chongqing on Thursday night, 451 Chinese civilians were killed and 291 seriously injured in a certain air raid shelter. There were also many minor injuries. Previous reports stated that 700 people had suffocated to death, and that a large portion of them were women. The official information stated, "Because this was the first night raid of the year, twice as many people as usual entered the air raid tunnel (which is one and a half miles long). Therefore, it was overcrowded, and unfortunately, the air circulation facilities malfunctioned, resulting in 451 deaths and 291 serious injuries. Many others were slightly injured." Three of the bombs dropped by the Japanese fell on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, 400 yards from the US Embassy. Another nine bombs fell on the bank of the river half a mile upstream from the embassy. This was the first time this year that the southern bank of the Yangtze River had been bombed. According to eyewitnesses, the Japanese air raid was quite spectacular. Before each major bombing, the Japanese aircraft dropped flares, most of which fell on the southern bank, some as far as a mile south of the Yangtze River. Onlookers were forced to flee indoors to avoid the debris from the flares. These observers stated that the Japanese aircraft's tactics were not very sophisticated, as the flares either fell on the ground or went out before the Japanese bombers arrived. Some of these bombers seemed unable to locate Chongqing, so they attacked areas five or ten miles away from Chongqing. These attacks did not appear to cause any damage. A major fire broke out in one location, burning for three or four hours, and covering an area of three acres, mostly shops and simple dwellings. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Re-examining the Axis Offensive</h3>
<p>The heads of Germany and Italy held a lengthy five-hour talk in the Brenner Pass on the second of this month. What exactly did they discuss and what was decided? Opinions vary, and there has never been a definitive report. Gathering reports from various sources, it seems that the main content of the talks was nothing more than (1) determining future military actions, (2) dealing with the possibility of US entry into the war, and (3) discussing how to build a "New European Order" to cope with a possible long-term war in the future. Regarding the third point, the issue focuses on economic restructuring and resource adjustment. Regarding the second point, one view is that Germany and Italy will force the United States to enter the war before its preparations are complete, while another view is that the Axis powers will still encourage Japan to take action to contain the United States. The issues involved are extremely delicate and deserve a separate analysis. Here, we will focus on examining the first point.</p>
<p>Recently, the general view is that Germany and Italy's next offensive will be either eastward or westward, or both. The so-called westward advance is to strike at Gibraltar to cut off the throat of the western Mediterranean. The so-called eastward advance is to take advantage of the recent victories in the Balkans and Crete to continue the offensive in the eastern Mediterranean, using paratroopers to attack Egypt on one side, and using Syria to strike Palestine and the outer Dan on the other, and then using a pincer strategy to attack the crucial Suez Canal. However, whether advancing east or west, the Axis powers need to make arrangements in politics, military affairs, and diplomacy first. First, in Western Europe, it is necessary to get France to be obedient. The recent reports that General Weygand had rushed back to his country from his defensive position in Africa to oppose the weak diplomacy of the Darlan cabinet, if true, would mean that Hitler's "Franco-German cooperation" policy would at least be subject to considerable constraints, let alone how to coerce the Vichy government to engage in war against Britain. Also, General Franco of Spain has never fully committed to the Axis powers. How to get him into the fold in the future to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for Germany and Italy will require considerable effort.</p>
<p>Secondly, in the eastern Mediterranean, although Crete has been conquered with great effort, military preparations for the invasion of Egypt do not seem sufficient. The situation in Syria has not yet been "clarified" due to internal disputes within France. At the same time, the attitudes of Turkey and even the Soviet Union still seem ambiguous. The cunning Hitler certainly knows the adage of "not hitting the rat for fear of breaking the vase." Why did we previously give up even Iraq, which was already within our grasp? Moreover, General Wavell's intention in not fully defending Greece and not fully defending Crete was likely to concentrate forces to strengthen the defense of Egypt and the Near East. Cyprus is not comparable to Crete, and Alexandria has long been the main force location of the British Near East Army, which is an undeniable fact. The only thing Germany can rely on in the future is Syria, which is already in an unfavorable situation of being surrounded on three sides by British forces. With US aid seemingly reaching Egypt directly via the Red Sea at this time, under these circumstances, unless there is a drastic change in the Near East's diplomatic and political situation, it seems unimaginable that Hitler's blitzkrieg will quickly succeed in that area.</p>
<p>In summary, it is clear that Hitler must continue to expand his offensive, which is beyond doubt. However, how to attack with greater certainty and which direction to attack is easier to start seems to be under careful discussion. It is also possible that as a result of the review, it is felt that more preparations are needed before launching a large-scale military operation. However, time is his greatest enemy. Therefore, in any case, he must make another "blitzkrieg" in the near future—even if this offensive will still be irrelevant to the final victory or defeat of the entire war. But in order to maintain his prestige, maintain morale, and attempt to break the crisis of a long-term war, he will have no choice but to do so.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt-Hull Statement: US Far East Policy Unchanged; Denies Negotiating a Non-Aggression Pact with Japan; Claims Such Action Violates US Policy</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt stated yesterday during a meeting with reporters that he had never heard of the rumored informal US-Japan negotiations for a non-aggression pact. He assumed that Japanese Ambassador Nomura had repeatedly met with Secretary of State Hull, but had not received any reports of any neutrality or non-aggression pacts. According to reports from Japanese sources here, Ambassador Nomura had explored the possibility of improving US-Japan relations during recent meetings, but the Japanese Embassy denied reports that Nomura had proposed a US-Japan non-aggression pact. This issue was not raised, nor are any negotiations on this matter intended. However, the Japanese Embassy acknowledged that Nomura had discussed ways to improve US-Japan relations during repeated meetings with US officials and non-officials. The Japanese Embassy declined to discuss the details, but other sources said that it was natural for the Japanese ambassador to explore such goodwill events. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull said yesterday at a press conference, referring to the rumored talks with Japan, that the United States' policy in the Pacific has never changed. His words clearly implied that any improvement in relations with Japan depends on the actions of the Japanese government. Hull also expressed the United States' attention to the commercial negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, saying that the United States firmly opposes any change in the status quo in the Far East. When asked whether the remarks he made on Thursday should be interpreted as the United States preparing to sever diplomatic relations with Vichy or preparing to occupy French territories, Hull replied that he would let the newspapers speculate on their own. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that negotiations for a US-Japan non-aggression treaty violate the established policy of the United States. He also said that the United States' principle of not entering into non-aggression treaties with any country was established ten years ago. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated that the United States opposes entering into non-aggression treaties separately with foreign countries. This policy of the United States remains unchanged. Hull also cited the precedent set by the Soviet Union in 1931 to prove this, as the Soviet Union also attempted to enter into a non-aggression treaty with the United States.

<h3>Britain and the United States Will Assist China by Air; Japanese Newspaper Advocates Active Response</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Kokumin Shimbun published an article today calling attention to the importance of increased cooperation between the British and American air forces and Chongqing, and urging the Japanese government to take active steps to respond to the actions of Britain and the United States and to end the China Incident as soon as possible. It also stated that a year ago, the newspaper of the right-wing party stated that it was very satisfied with the US military facilities in Hawaii, Guam, Wake Island, and Midway Island to counter Japan. Today, the United States has sent aviators, aircraft, and engineers to Singapore and Burma, while strengthening cooperation with China, Australia, and New Zealand. It is rumored that the United States has sent fighter planes, volunteer pilots, and 300 American-Chinese pilots to Chongqing, and that Guilin and Xianyang will build US air force bases according to the Sino-American sky mutual defense agreement. Although this is not entirely credible, there are credible things. Britain and the United States will definitely assist Chongqing by air in the future, as the supply lines from the coast to Chongqing are now blocked by the Japanese army. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The US Department of Commerce revealed that in the past three months, the total amount of US gasoline exported to Japan has exceeded one million gallons. This amount is sufficient to meet Japan's aviation needs. It is said that although President Roosevelt has implemented an embargo on raw material exports, the amount of oil exported to Japan this year is five times greater than in the past five years. At the same time, scrap iron intended to be shipped to Japan has been sitting in various parts of the United States, waiting for export licenses, for over a year. An official commented on the increased gasoline exports to Japan, saying, "US gasoline exports to Japan are part of the appeasement policy, which will give Japan a false sense of security and cause it to abandon the accumulation of large amounts of gasoline."

<h3>Foreign Ship Requisition Bill Signed into Law by US President; Approximately 80 Ships Totaling 450,000 Tons; Cannot be Subleased to Belligerent Countries Without Special Permission</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt yesterday signed the bill approved by Congress authorizing the government to requisition idle foreign ships in US seaports, and authorized the US Maritime Commission by executive order to relocate foreign ships. It was not specified whether French ships in American ports would be requisitioned or when they would be requisitioned. The President said at a press conference that he did not know if French ships would be requisitioned. Coast Guard personnel are currently stationed on French ships in US seaports. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt signed into law yesterday the bill allowing the government to requisition 80 foreign ships in the United States. The bill stipulates that the government may lease any foreign ship for foreign or coastal business, but may not sublease it to a belligerent government without the President's special permission. The aforementioned foreign ships include 36 Spanish ships, 26 Italian ships, 2 German ships, 2 Estonian ships, 1 Lithuanian and 1 Romanian ship, and 14 French ships. (7th Reuters dispatch) Washington: The foreign ship confiscation case was signed by President Roosevelt yesterday. The case authorized the Shipping Committee to receive 450,000 tons of foreign ships parked there. Among the ships confiscated were the magnificent French mail ship Normandie and 11 other French ships, as well as Italian and German ships. It is understood that all ships will be driven by the United States, and will eventually be given to the United Kingdom. (7th International News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: According to reports, President Roosevelt has approved the seizure of the French ocean liner Normandie. The ship was completed in 1935, weighs 83,433 tons, and is the second largest ship in the world, with a speed of 28.5 knots per hour. It is owned by the French Atlantic Shipping Company.

<h3>Hirade Issues Threatening Remarks Again; US Warships Patrol the Pacific; Japan May Join the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Miyako Shimbun this morning quoted Navy Ministry spokesman Hideo Hirade as saying that if the Axis powers' attacks extend to the Pacific, the United States may extend its naval patrols to that ocean. This action may be a prelude to Japan's possible entry into the war. If Japan participates in the war, there will be a sudden change in the Pacific. However, the official did not discuss what actions Japan would take if it did so. He also said that naval patrols are tantamount to indirect escort. He meant that patrols require large fleets of warships, but if the United States does not transfer more ships to concentrate in the Atlantic, its actions in that ocean will not be fully effective. If the United States believes that Britain is its first line of defense, a larger US fleet must be concentrated in the Atlantic. But if the United States places emphasis on China's war against Japan, it will have to maintain a strong navy in the Pacific. (7th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Pacific Fleet to Cruise West Coast Again</h3>
<p>Washington: The US Navy Department announced yesterday that plans for various fleets in the Hawaii area to make a return cruise to the West Coast have been approved. This plan was proposed by Admiral Kimmel, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet. The Navy Department said that the cruise to the West Coast will be divided into several small groups, with the purpose of recreation and giving officers of the fleet the opportunity to visit their families. As for the confirmed plan, the number of warships in the first group or the date of departure has not been announced. In retrospect, the Navy Department also made similar cruises in three groups last year. This will be the second time in a year. (7th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Dutch East Indies Replies to Japanese Proposals, Insisting on Economic Independence, Strictly Rejecting Any Raw Materials Sufficient to Aid the Enemy, Arita Expresses Dissatisfaction but States He is Continuing Negotiations</h3>
<p>Batavia: Van Mook, the chief representative of the Dutch East Indies in the Japanese-Dutch negotiations, declared today that the Dutch East Indies' response to Japan's demands is premised on two policies: (1) The matter of a new order in East Asia is fundamentally out of the question; (2) The Dutch East Indies cannot supply any raw materials sufficient to flow to enemy countries. After Van Mook delivered the reply to Japanese Chief Representative Arita, he issued a formal statement saying, "The reply has not yet reached the Japanese representative's hands, and I am unable to disclose its contents. However, the Dutch government is determined to maintain its original policies and principles for the future development of the Dutch East Indies and will take measures to prevent direct or indirect assistance to the enemy. However, the Dutch government is not opposed to contributing to the enhancement of economic relations between the two countries within the scope of this principle." Arita, on the one hand, declared that the Dutch East Indies' reply was unsatisfactory, and on the other hand, went to the golf course to play golf with the British Consul General. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Batavia: After the Dutch East Indies government clarified several points in its final reply to Japan, Japanese delegation leader Kichisaburo Nomura declared last night that, regarding the future of the negotiations, he "must either stay here or leave." When reporters asked if there was a possibility of war under the current circumstances, Nomura replied that this was beyond his authority and must be decided by Tokyo. Nomura admitted that the Dutch East Indies' reply was not satisfactory and that future negotiations would depend on the Dutch side's attitude toward the matter. Nomura requested that more of his original remarks be published. The text stated, "I hope the Dutch East Indies can retreat somewhat further to approach our wishes. Unfortunately, the reply we received contains many points that we cannot agree to, not only regarding the supply of raw materials but also in other respects, which are not in line with our country's views. My responsibility is to mediate and negotiate to avoid a final move. After some points are resolved, I will either stay here or leave." (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese chief representative to the trade negotiations with the Dutch East Indies, Nomura, told a "Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" reporter last night in a wireless telephone call that he had received the Dutch East Indies' reply to "Japan's final proposal" on May 14, which contained numerous unsatisfactory points, but he refused to disclose its contents. Nomura also told the reporter that he had requested the Dutch authorities to clarify these points for further discussion, and that the attitude of the Dutch East Indies authorities was very firm. He also said that if the Dutch leaders could no longer understand Japan's intentions, the Japanese representatives would have no choice but to leave Batavia. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Nichi-Nichi Shimbun commented today on the Dutch reply, which Nomura deemed unsatisfactory, saying that the future of the negotiations was extremely pessimistic. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the Japanese side's final attitude toward the Dutch East Indies would be carefully studied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and it was expected that Matsuoka would discuss the matter with the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of the Army. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London: The Dutch government announced yesterday that the Dutch Minister to Tokyo, Pabst, had formally protested to Ishii, the deputy spokesman for the Japanese Information Bureau, regarding his recent accusations that the Dutch East Indies lacked sincerity in the negotiations, considering such observations to be completely unfounded.

<h3>President Roosevelt Exposes Nazi Peace Offensive, Claims British Seeking Peace is German Propaganda, Reminds Public Not to be Deceived</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt yesterday denounced the European peace offensive spreading in Washington as fabricated by Nazi propagandists. The President insisted that Britain was far from collapse and denied that U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant was carrying peace proposals to the U.S. The President also said that many Americans were being fooled by German propaganda. The President also accused the Berlin Propaganda Ministry of instructing Nazi sympathizers in the U.S. to proceed according to the following two steps regarding peace talks: (1) spread peace rumors and simultaneously promote the idea that Germany has no intention of attacking any country in the Western Hemisphere, etc.; (2) after Winant arrives in the U.S., these special envoys should spread stories that Winant is carrying the so-called news that Britain is already exhausted and cannot fight any longer. President Roosevelt also said that Berlin had ordered the dissemination of rumors that Britain was negotiating peace, and that this news originated in Berlin, but some American newspapers, without realizing it, published it. The President also stated that he did not want people to believe these peace rumors, but wanted to point out that some Americans were being deceived by these rumors. The President said that Winant's mission was entirely related to Anglo-American relations and the situation of the war in Britain. Winant's return to the U.S. had two purposes: (1) to report on twenty-five major issues related to the war; (2) to obtain information here on these twenty-five issues and take it back across the Atlantic. The President then strongly condemned various rumors about the U.S. Ambassador's return to the U.S. and said that he had a memorandum to prove that the Berlin government's propaganda department had ordered the Nazi Party in the U.S. to spread the message that Germany had peaceful intentions toward the Western Hemisphere. In addition, coincidentally, the news carried by a newspaper in Washington about the former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland and Belgium, Cudahy, meeting with Hitler also contained similar news. The President also pointed out that the newspaper that published this news had belittled the value of German assurances in the text. The President also specifically pointed out that a new bomber manufacturer had been ordered to spread this rumor. The President also pointed out that this Nazi instruction was not only transmitted to the Nazi Party in the U.S., but also to those in the party who were foolish and advocated appeasement. However, the agency in the U.S. that Hitler instructed to spread rumors refused to publicize it. The President said that he had received an excellent document regarding what orders Berlin had issued, but asked the reporters not to ask where he had obtained this information. The President's wording was very careful when referring to the fact that many Americans were being fooled by German news that Britain was on the verge of collapse and that peace was underway, and when the reporters directly quoted the President, the President also carefully considered the wording before dictating it and instructing the stenographers and reporters to take notes.

<h3>Britain Will Ultimately Win</h3>
<p>Washington: According to responsible sources, U.S. Ambassador to Britain Winant, in a two-hour meeting yesterday with the Vice President and four prominent Democratic senators, mainly discussed the high morale of the British and their certainty of winning the war. It was reported that Mr. Zhang claimed that there was solid reason to believe that the British Air Force had gained air supremacy over the English Channel, the British Isles, and the German-occupied ports. Although Mr. Winant admitted that ship losses were quite severe, he believed that the failures in Greece and Crete did not mean that the Mediterranean had failed. Mr. Winant also said that British Prime Minister Churchill now has the full support of the British people and has not suggested any changes to the U.S. aid program. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>German Diplomatic Activities, Threats to Turkey Have Not Yet Been Effective, Attempt to Block U.S. Aid to Britain, Subtle Relations Between Germany and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>London: Last night, official circles here announced that Sir Stafford Cripps, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, will return to London shortly at the request of the British Foreign Secretary to report on his duties, and will return to his post after staying for a few days. Since Sir Stafford Cripps was sent to the Soviet Union last June, he has not returned to Britain, but Foreign Secretary Eden contacted him in Cyprus when he visited Turkey in March this year. According to Londoners, it is common for foreign representatives to return home to report on their duties when needed. Now that the Battle of Crete has ended, Germany is more active in diplomacy than in military affairs. The targets of its activities are Turkey, the United States, and other neutral countries. As for Turkey, Germany seems to want to threaten Turkey with the news that Germany has amassed a large army in Syria, making Turkey realize that although it has not been invaded, it is in danger of being surrounded by enemy forces on both the southeast and west sides. However, Turkey has resisted Germany's insidious attempts to penetrate and continues to sympathize with Britain's war against Italy. This strong position has naturally made the Germans annoyed and uneasy. At this time when Cripps returns to England, it is appropriate for outsiders to spread the word that German-Soviet relations may become strained and that Germany is assisting Finland in reorganizing its armaments. Germany is good at creating psychological warfare, even against its closest friends, so these rumors are obviously not to be believed lightly. However, the interests of the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Britain are the same in the Near East, especially in Iran. At least these three countries do not want to see German power extend into Iran. The Soviet Union also does not want to be fooled and take any steps that are detrimental to its own interests. Therefore, as far as can be seen at present, Germany's recent efforts to threaten Turkey have not been more effective than before. Germany's diplomatic movements toward the United States and other neutral countries are focused on the so-called peace offensive. Today, peace news mostly comes from the capitals of various neutral countries. In fact, Hitler is extremely uneasy about the quantity and speed of American aid to Britain and feels that it is necessary to find ways to prevent American aid to Britain, knowing that the key point of the whole event is the issue of war materials. Therefore, all its propaganda focuses on stopping this supply, and it tells the United States, France, and neutral countries that American aid is too late to enable Britain to win. The best plan now is to conclude a comprehensive peace settlement throughout Europe. Today, there are rumors in various neutral countries about what the settlement conditions will be. It is expected that if Hitler does issue his peace proposals in the future, the conditions he proposes will be more moderate than those that are widely circulated. First, he will use neutral newspapers to release test balloons to spread harsh conditions, and then make more moderate proposals when implementing peace proposals to show his benevolence. This is indeed a Nazi trick. Hitler's attempt to resolve the situation probably also stems from the situation inside Germany. The heavy casualties of the German forces in Crete, the tragic deaths of many people in Germany last winter, and the criticism of the war within the Nazi Party all seem to be factors that prompted Hitler to launch this movement. A person from a certain neutral country recently came to London from Berlin and told a Reuters reporter in detail the extent of the current anti-war sentiment in Germany. Although excessive remarks should not be believed lightly, the Nazis' recent victory must have had a good impact on German public opinion. However, according to the informant, there is indeed doubt within the Nazi Party as to whether it is wise to continue the war, and Hitler is also eager to consolidate his gains in Europe while he can still control the countries he has conquered by force. In view of the above reasons, it seems that Hitler's view of the new peace movement is not without reason. However, Britain's cold attitude towards this movement seems to have disappointed Hitler. Indeed, as a certain commentator said this morning, before the dish is served, the diner already knows that there is poison in the dish. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Talks About International Law, Says Escorting Means War, Believes It is Difficult for Germany to Attack the U.S.</h3>
<p>New York: The largest American magazine "Life Weekly" yesterday published an excerpt of Hitler's conversation with the magazine's reporter, Cudahy (former U.S. Ambassador to Belgium). The original text is very long, and the most striking part is Hitler's declaration that "escorting means war." There are many precedents in international law. "If warships openly escort munitions and weapons to one of the warring parties, it is undoubtedly an act of war. Any legal authority agrees on this." Regarding the claim that Germany would attack the United States, Hitler insisted that "it is no different than saying that Germany will attack the moon." What could be more absurd and ridiculous than this? (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Recalled Home, New Anglo-Soviet Agreement, Prelude to Improving Relations</h3>

They will stay here for two days before returning to London. The British Ambassador was recalled by London for consultation. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: It is learned here that the British Minister to Finland, Weirick, and Cripps arrived in Stockholm at the same time. Weirick is a "Soviet expert" in the United Kingdom and served as a counselor at the British Embassy in the Soviet Union from 1937 to 1939. It is predicted that the two will meet to discuss Soviet issues. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>London: British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps was recalled to England yesterday to report after the conclusion of the Anglo-Soviet agreement. The agreement stipulates that 350 sailors of Baltic nationality detained in Britain will be released. This is the first concrete step in improving relations between the two countries in the past year. The agreement was concluded after months of negotiations between British Foreign Secretary Eden and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky. The Soviet side insisted that Britain should recognize the Soviet Union's annexation of the Baltic states and release more than 20 Baltic ships and their crews detained by Britain when this happened. Britain refused all of this, but agreed to release the crew. Informed sources said that although Sir Stafford Cripps is returning to the country, there is little hope for a surprising improvement in Anglo-Soviet relations. It is believed that Eden is keen to receive a report on the Soviet Union's attitude toward Germany's eastward advance. (Reuters, 7th)</p>

<h3>German Army Reinforcements Arrive, Great Battle Brewing in Western Desert, Aiming to Attack Cairo, British Defense Forces Greatly Strengthened</h3>
<p>Cairo: According to news arriving here today, the Axis forces are making various preparations to carry out a large-scale mechanized offensive in the Near East in the near future. It is reported that the Nazi troops are braving the desert heat of 125 degrees and disregarding the rational methods of desert warfare and are now preparing for a fierce tank blitzkrieg, with Alexandria as their main target. It is reported that the German army is ready to implement this brewing large-scale desert blitzkrieg and is unwilling to wait for more favorable weather in mid-autumn, because, in their opinion, more American-made military supplies will arrive in Britain by autumn. Although hundreds of thousands of tons of Axis convoys in Libya have been sunk by the British, the German army has been reinforced in terms of manpower and material resources and is being transported to the desert to prepare for the future battle. It is reported that the British army has also received large reinforcements from the Balkans. (International News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>London: Although British people's attention today is divided among (1) Syria, (2) the British House of Commons debate after the failure of Crete, and (3) President Roosevelt's condemnation of the Axis powers for spreading peace rumors, the London newspapers are focusing on the expected Axis attack on Cairo. Military commentators today are paying close attention to the western border of Egypt. These people believe that Rommel, the German commander in Africa, must have greatly reinforced his forces to prepare for an attack on Cairo, and that Britain is also strengthening its forces with South African troops from the Abyssinian campaign. One commentator said that the increase in British troops in the western desert area is the best news from the Middle East and expects that when Rommel launches an attack from Libya, the British army will have a remarkable defense of the Nile. Cairo's British correspondents, who did not state their source, said that huge German transport planes and transport aircraft capable of carrying many tons of giant guns, beverages, oil, or food are landing in Syria. These people also said that they have sufficient evidence to know that the German army is rapidly building Syrian airfields as a base of operations. These people also said that there are 500 of these giant aircraft, the same type as the aircraft that transport military supplies to the German army in the western desert area. Carrying troops from Rhodes to Syria flies twice a day, and in three days, it can transport a whole division of German troops. If the Germans can achieve a dominant military position there, they will be able to control the four major airfields of Damascus, Rayaq, Aleppo, and Barrela, and then carry out the above-mentioned transportation. These people also said that giant Nazi aircraft can carry various giant guns up to 10 inches in diameter, as well as light armored vehicles, tanks, and motorcycles. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Cairo: The arrival of South African troops in the Middle East and the arrival of Colonel Strydom (South African Minister of Mines), the representative of General Smuts, in Egypt were announced simultaneously last night. The communique stated that Colonel Strydom recently arrived in Egypt with Brigadier General Bryan, the South African Minister of Defense, to inspect the South African troops stationed there. Colonel Smith visited Egyptian Prime Minister. General Wavell. After General Tedder (the new commander of the British Air Force in the Middle East), will inspect the troops stationed in various places where the South African army is stationed. These South African troops have given a very good impression and have been warmly welcomed by the British Imperial Army and the Allied Forces. The South African troops began to move north before the capture of Addis Ababa. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Melbourne: Australian Prime Minister Menzies said in a speech here yesterday that when the Australian army is fighting in the Middle East, the British will do everything possible to send as many aircraft as possible to assist. The Australian Prime Minister also asked Australians to work harder than before. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: On the evening of the 5th of this month, German aircraft bombed the port of Alexandria for the first time from the new base in Crete. The harbor and oil depots were hit, and fires broke out everywhere. The port has been threatened from both sides. Crete, to the north, is only 550 kilometers away, and Tobruk, to the west, is only 450 kilometers away. Ten German long-range bombers attacked Scapa Bay from a base 900 kilometers away, and there is no problem in attacking Alexandria from Crete and Solon. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German commentators commented on the German air raid on Alexandria on Wednesday, saying that the attack was the "most gentle action" and that the German High Command in the Middle East intended to make the Mediterranean region the "hottest corner of hell" in the current war. According to certain sources, the British Navy was the first to bear the brunt of the recent German air raids. At the same time, news was received here that Germany intends to make Crete a huge base for Axis aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean to deal with the nearby British Navy.

<h3>10,000 British Reinforcements Stationed on the Border of Transjordan, Germans Infiltrate Syria in a Steady Stream, German Submarines Discovered in Beirut Port</h3>
<p>Damascus: It was learned today that 10,000 British soldiers have been added to the garrison in Irbid, Transjordan. Part of the population of Damascus has been evacuated. Deep trenches have been dug and strong fortresses have been built around Damascus, as if facing a great enemy. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Cairo: Little news comes from Syria, but it is widely rumored in Cairo that German tourists are still arriving in Syria in a steady stream, and that a large number of Germans have been trained in the use of French weapons. It is rumored that German transport planes have been discovered at the Syrian airfield. The recent British Air Force communique mentioned that the British attacked the Italian aircraft in the Aleppo airfield in Syria, which is quite noteworthy. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to reports from travelers from Syria, German technical experts and officials in Beirut have almost completely taken over the Syrian administrative organs, but it is not yet clear whether a large German army has landed in Syria. Responsible officials familiar with the situation said that if Vichy fully complies with the Axis's plan for Syria, the result will only be great chaos. Although the Syrian administrator, Dentz, has announced that the French army will protect Syria by force, it is doubtful whether it will actually be effective, because in recent times, French commanders, pilots, and soldiers have increasingly joined under the command of de Gaulle. The army stationed in the Near East by France is composed of mixed troops and cannot be regarded as a highly effective fighting force, including African blacks, Armenian troops, Annamese troops, and the officers are partly anti-Vichy, and there is a possibility of changing flags at any time.

<h3>Former Egyptian Chief of Staff Arrested After Fleeing</h3>
<p>Cairo: Masri, the former Egyptian Chief of Staff, fled at dawn on May 16 with two young Egyptian pilots in an Egyptian army plane, attempting to escape to the countryside. The Egyptian police searched the country and arrested the three men in a village on the outskirts of Cairo, a few miles from the police headquarters, yesterday afternoon, after three weeks. After Masri fled, the authorities immediately offered a reward of 1,000 pounds for his capture and ordered all Egyptian police to search. Within a few days, a overturned car was found a few miles from the pyramids, believed to be the car of Masri and the other two. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>Difficult Birth of Egyptian Cabinet</h3>

<h3>Vichy Issues Statement, Responding to Hull's Remarks, Policy is Not Directed Against Other Countries, Sincerely Wishes to Maintain Traditional Friendship with the U.S.</h3>
<p>Vichy: The authorities issued a statement last night in response to Hull's warning, expressing surprise at the U.S. Secretary of State's claim that Vichy's policy was of an aggressive and oppressive nature, and stating that this policy was not aimed at any country, nor did it harm the interests of any country, but was motivated only by the desire to build better relations in Europe, maintain the freedom of the French Empire, and defend communication lines against any attacks. The French government sincerely wishes to maintain friendly relations between the U.S. and France. The U.S. should be able to understand this initial effort to protect France and its important imperial interests. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Henry Seeks Meeting with Hull for Explanation</h3>
<p>Washington - Following Secretary of State Hull's statement yesterday regarding relations between France and the United States, French Ambassador to the U.S., Henry Haye, has requested a meeting with Secretary Hull at his convenience. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - French Ambassador to the U.S., Henry Haye, yesterday, at a special intelligence conference, gave a direct response to U.S. Secretary of State Hull's criticism of the French government and denied that France intends to act contrary to the fate of its own country or the United States. Although Haye did not mention Hull by name, he pointed out that "the responsibility for the deteriorating relations between France and the U.S. should be borne by rumors and deliberately exaggerated news." Haye solemnly stated to American reporters that, with the exception of a few citizens residing abroad, the entire French people unanimously support Marshal Pétain. The rumors that German troops have landed in Dakar, Casablanca, Syrian ports, and other French Mediterranean ports are completely untrue. Haye categorically denied the shocking news conveyed by representatives of the U.S. government that German troops have landed in the Middle East and that France intends to initiate a conflict with Britain. However, he confirmed that the French government had issued a declaration resolving to repel any attack on French territory. Haye continued, stating that "We are deeply grateful to the U.S. government for providing food to France, but one thing we find painful is that the request to use two million dollars to purchase meat for our prisoners of war has not been granted. The French people truly do not understand why, in terms of financial matters, we are treated more harshly than Germany, Italy, and Japan. It is self-evident that the U.S. policy is based on aiding Britain. However, the French were the first to declare war to aid Britain, mobilizing all men from twenty to fifty years of age nationwide and providing all resources for British use. Is it because we have already encountered such significant sacrifices that we have no right to defend our national sovereignty?" In short, we have not shown an unfriendly attitude towards the United States and have returned to America to provide assurances regarding French territories in the Western Hemisphere, but France's intention regarding its own fate cannot be opposed by the United States.

<h3>U.S. Aviation Delegation Flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong the Night Before Last; Traveled 8,000 Miles in China for Three Weeks; Conducted Close Examination of China's Aviation Facilities</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The U.S. aviation delegation to China, led by Brigadier General Clagett, commander of the U.S. Army Air Corps Philippine Division, toured the Free China area for three weeks, traveling over 8,000 miles, and conducted a close examination of China's aviation facilities. Last night, they completed their mission and left by plane for Hong Kong. The delegation's other two representatives were Lieutenant Colonel George of the U.S. Army Air Corps and Major McGinnell of the U.S. Navy. The three representatives will immediately go to Manila, after which Major McDonnell will return to Washington to report on his findings. When discussing this visit, Clagett said, "After we came here to inspect, we were truly amazed, because China really does have an air force." The delegation stated that they had flown approximately 8,000 miles during their inspection and that the Chinese side had provided them with the most ample and complete facilities. The Chinese side had fully revealed everything to us. The three representatives refused to discuss the purpose of their trip, stating only that they were sent here to inspect and study all of China's air force equipment and personnel. The delegation also stated that, in terms of the overall situation, China's air force has indeed achieved great results. Informed sources recalled that Minister of War General He Yingqin declared to United Press reporters last week that if the U.S. and Japan were at war, China would be willing to provide all its aviation facilities and airfields for the U.S. Air Force to use as much as possible. Informed sources pointed out that China had given the U.S. delegation the opportunity to examine all aspects of China's aviation situation, and that such convenience had not been given to other foreign delegations during wartime. Brigadier General Clagett is a bombing expert, while Lieutenant Colonel George is a pursuit plane expert. He previously served as commander of the U.S. 35th Pursuit Squadron. Major McDonnell went to Malaya in April to inspect the British Air Force. Accompanied the delegation to Hong Kong were Lieutenant Colonel Barrick, Assistant Military Attaché of the U.S. Embassy, and Major McGinnell, Assistant Naval Attaché. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Grain: Ocean Rice Skyrockets</h3>
<p>The ocean rice market has tightened again after a period of decline. Yesterday's opening continued the momentum, with generally optimistic sentiment. Inland traders, who had long been inactive, suddenly started actively trading mid-grade goods, and rural customers continued to show strong interest. With buying interest strong, the situation quickly turned bullish. Major speculators and original rice merchants not only stopped selling off but also took the opportunity to raise prices, fueling the upward trend. Prices of mid-grade goods rose steadily. However, high-grade goods such as No. 1 Saigon "Fire Twist" were only sold locally and, affected by the price of regular rice, did not sell well, so they could only tighten slightly. Therefore, the closing price for No. 1 Saigon was still $119 to $117.50, and "Fire Twist" was $117.40 to $116.50. As for other goods, they increased by about $2 compared to the previous day. No. 2 Saigon was $114 to $113.50, No. 2 Jia Luo High White was $112, the lower grade was $108 or $109, the "Min Dang Special" ranged from $119 down to $116, "Small Twist" was $115.50 to $114.50, Tokyo Pointed was $107, the lower grade was $103, Rice Green was $101 to $100, and Broken Pointed was $92 to $90.</p>
<p>Thick and thin japonica domestic rice had balanced arrivals and sales, and the market remained unchanged. Opening prices were similar to the previous day. Nangang early and late rice remained at $135, the lower grade was $130. Wuxi Aged Japonica in the original package was $122, $120.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice imported at ocean prices was scarce, at $120. Prices remained firm, and bids quickly rose upon inquiry. However, demand from food stalls and cake shops was higher than usual, creating a sense of supply falling short of demand. Prices continued to rise by about $1. Hong Kong White was priced at $114 or $115, and Special Round Grain was $116 or $117. Glutinous Green was $105 or $106. Domestic glutinous rice, however, was of poor quality, damp and soft, and did not last long, so sales were average, and the market remained weak, still at $121 or $122.</p>
<p>Corn shipped to North China - Ocean corn (i.e., Pearl Rice) shipped from Saigon and Java has never had a large market in this city. Only North China uses it to supplement its grain supply, so ocean corn must be transshipped to North China. The Taikoo Company's "Shuntian" steamer carried 1,500 bags to Yantai the other day. Jardine Matheson's "Fulong" steamer also loaded over 920 bags for export to Yantai yesterday. (Ancestor)</p>
<h3>Flour Market Continues to Trend Higher</h3>
<p>Flour - Yesterday, the market continued to trend higher. The opening in the morning was still average, but quickly, due to rising rice prices and a surge in empty positions on the spot cake market, sentiment was greatly boosted. Local speculators showed some interest. "Golden Dragon" brand "Kan" flour opened at only $28.20 to $28.25, but the market quickly rose to $28.60. "Flower Bird" brand Australian flour also rose to $29.90, an increase of 30 to 40 cents from the previous day. However, with the new wheat harvest just around the corner, market fundamentals have not yet stabilized, and there is little hope for real sales to expand for the time being.</p>
<p>Ocean flour is transshipped to Shanghai - Jardine Matheson's "Minsheng" steamer arrived in port yesterday, carrying 1,958 bags of ocean flour shipped from Hong Kong, and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf to unload.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains and Bean Cakes Make a Comeback from Multiple Directions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bean cake market suddenly underwent a dramatic change, with prices rising by more than $1 at their peak. This was because general traders with floating capital had no opportunities to profit and, seeing the sharp fall in cake prices, felt that the downward trend would not be easily overcome. This prompted bullish sentiment, and companies were formed from various quarters to actively trade, leading to active "scalping." The market was disrupted, and prices were pushed higher and higher. As a result, there was a slight pullback at the close, but the market was still up about 50 cents from the previous day. The total transaction volume was three trucks of "Fat Character" spot cake, priced at $17.20. Shengji cake opened with over 40,000 pieces, with March warehouse receipts at $17.50, June upper warehouse receipts at $19.20 to $19.15, May upper warehouse receipts delivered in June at $17.95, and May lower warehouse receipts delivered in June from $19 to $19.85, closing at 50 cents. June upper warehouse receipts delivered in June lower ranged from $19.50 to $20.03, closing at $19.80.</p>

Chinese speculators did not participate, and transactions were scarce. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>

The opening bank selling price for internal盘 spot British exchange was 3125 yuan, and the price for American exchange was 5.40625. It was heard that foreign banks sold, and HSBC's appetite for absorption was slightly better due to selling pressure from Chinese banks. HSBC purchased US dollars at 5.375 for June and 5.40625 for July, stopping the decline and returning to level, then trending sideways. At the noon close, spot to July British gold was 3125, and US dollars were 5.375, with no change from the previous day's closing price.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Turns from Falling to Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market was dull and remained constant, while the dark market shifted from a decline to an increase due to a weakening US dollar in the distant month, but quickly returned to level. Additionally, news from the Dutch East Indies was not as negative as the previous day, and short sellers began to cover their positions. Prices opened lower in the morning, at $6,435, then slowly rose to $6,450, ultimately轧rising by $8. Total transactions for the day were 13,000 to 14,000 taels. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. Cash prices were also stable. Fei Wenyuan sold 100 taels to Xianghe, Hesheng sold 20 taels to Zhongxing, and Defu sold 100 taels to Shunyuan, and also sold 50 taels each to Shihe and Xintian, all at a price $300 higher than the forward price, also 轧rising by several dollars.

Yida, Chengji, Xinfengyong, Yangyuan, Yili, and others entered the market one after another, raising the price to $6,448, as Hengji (Guangdong dealer) turned to selling short 3,000 taels, causing the price to retreat to $6,437.

<h3>Cocoa and Chocolate (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>However, when Cortez led a group of rough and uncouth soldiers to conquer the ancient Aztec Empire, they forced the scholars to mine and extract gold for them. The cocoa tree, which had been so cherished, nurtured, and diligently cultivated by the Mexicans for so many years, was then neglected and abandoned, and completely trampled upon. However, later, the Spanish also recognized the value of this tree, and as a result, they completely monopolized cocoa, strictly prohibiting its export, in order to swallow all the profits. Finally, they also transplanted it to South America, and then, in 1674 and 1680, they shipped it to the Philippine Islands twice, from where it spread to eastern India and the South Seas Islands: because the climate in these places was suitable, the transplantation work was very successful. As for the Portuguese, they also spread the cocoa tree to the Gulf of Guinea and the Congo River basin in Africa, and now these places have become the main suppliers of cocoa: for example, the port of Cortez on the Gold Coast exports about 150,000 tons of cocoa every year, while the local output is 250,000 tons.</p>
<p>The work of cultivating cocoa trees is very troublesome and arduous: it requires a constant temperature of 27 degrees Celsius throughout the year, abundant rainfall, and extremely fertile soil; it is also afraid of the scorching sun and storms, so it must have shade to shield it. Ordinary people plant it in low-lying mountain valleys; if it is planted on open plains without any cover, they use taller banana trees as its protector. It does not begin to flower until it is three years old, but people always cut them off, and wait until the fifth year: at this time, it begins to bear fruit, and can provide a large amount of harvest for the next 25 or 30 years. The cocoa tree flowers all year round, but people only harvest cocoa twice a year, in June and December.</p>
<p>The ways of consuming cocoa, such as brewing it to drink like tea or dissolving it in milk to eat, are already well-known, so there is no need to describe them in detail; however, the evolution and development of its manufacture into "chocolate" candy cannot be ignored without a brief introduction. Speaking of the ancient Mexicans' way of eating cocoa, it would not only fail to move our taste buds or whet our appetite, but would probably terrify and horrify us! Originally, when they ate it, they roasted the cocoa, ground it into a fine powder, mixed it with cornmeal, and boiled it into a paste - another "muddle!" - then added a large amount of... chili peppers and black pepper! This reddish-brown muddle was the original "chocolate" that the ancient Mexicans loved and ate the most! Ah, this thing, I think can be translated as "Chou Kou La" according to the original ancient Mexican sound Tchocolatl, or as "Shou Kou La" according to the Spanish or French chocolat: no matter what, the spicy kick of this stuff must be unbearable for us. However, the Mexicans were so addicted to it, so enthusiastically supporting it, that the Catholic believers in the city of Chia pa would rather break off relations with Catholicism, because the Catholics in that city wanted to prohibit them from eating their precious "Chou Kou La" when participating in religious ceremonies!</p>
<p>To put it more solemnly: the reason why chocolate can become something that everyone loves to eat now is really the invention of the Spanish, because this requires knowing the use of sugar. The Spanish not only added cane sugar to it, but also mixed it with spices, such as vanilla beans, a flower called Orjeval, and even ambergris and musk. This "chocolate" candy, which still bore the old Mexican name, first spread to Spain, and became very popular. However, its value was very expensive, and only princes and nobles could occasionally taste it for many years. Common people did not have the good fortune to personally taste this "divine food" that could be called the essence of jade juice. In 1651, chocolate was first introduced to France: at that time, Louis XIV was in his childhood and was regented by Queen Mother Anne of Austria. The Queen Mother also immediately favored and doted on this sweet food, making it famous far and wide. In 1659, Louis XIV married the Spanish princess Maria Theresa: this hot and sweet chocolate melt met many nobles and ladies at the magnificent royal banquet, and further penetrated into the social strata. From 1715 to 1723, the French regent Philippe was even more addicted to it, enjoying it in large quantities. However, at this time, as in Spain: because of its excessively high value, it was out of reach and was only a decoration for the rich and noble. It was during this period that doctors added many nourishing medicines to chocolate and changed it from a paste to a pill, falsely claiming that it was a magical medicine for tonifying yin and strengthening yang, so that the Catholic Church derisively called chocolate "devil food!" - which is agreeable and contrary. - Therefore, ordinary chocolate, in order to distinguish it from the chocolate used in medicine, was crowned with the word "health" and called "health chocolate." To sum up: the original chocolate was a paste, a "muddle," and the reason why it became the current block or pill shape was due to the improvement and advancement of doctors.</p>
<p>Although chocolate does not have the special effect of coffee in refreshing and invigorating, it is also a very good-looking food, and its sweet taste is of course more popular than the bitter coffee. As its sales have become increasingly widespread, there are now special shops dedicated to large-scale manufacturing: France's first chocolate candy store was founded in 1776 and was called Grand d'Aussy. However, this store was probably not established to seek the happiness of the people, because it still carried the title of "Royal" chocolate store! After many years, because of the increased supply of cocoa and the large-scale production of cane sugar at low prices, chocolate also changed its former face of exclusively catering to the nobility, and modestly lowered its price to become closer to us ordinary people. Now, as long as we are willing to spend a small price, we can also taste the flavor of this "divine food."</p>

<h3>Telegraphic Transfers Surprisingly Increase in Premium</h3>
<p>The discount for telegraphic transfers from this mountain has dropped from $280 to around $1. The reason for its decline has been detailed in this newspaper on May 25.

This newspaper's prediction (May 25) regarding the premium for telegraphic transfers has come true. (Lu)</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>The public bond暗盘 market initially trended firm yesterday, but then gradually weakened. On the one hand, short covering gradually became scarce, and major longs gradually felt satisfied. Moreover, there were rumors that the war situation was slightly unfavorable, and sales from Tongan became increasingly frequent, causing slight nervousness. The current trend avoided causing a recovery, and the large rise and small pullback was a path that the curve should take. Yesterday was Saturday, and only one session was held to clear the after-market transactions from the afternoon before, in order to facilitate the bank's receipt and delivery. The market opened at 11:00 a.m., and Hongda was still buying, with prices initially rising by two or three cents. Tongan sold off, and Xinfu and Shengda bought again. Lianyi and Yitai sold off again. Jiufeng and Jiucheng were also selling. Although Lianhe and Runde were buying, they could not overcome the high selling pressure, and various prices slowly weakened. The longs were unable to pull up prices, but their strength only extended to Class C, so the closing price was maintained at the original price. After the close, the dark market softened slightly by one or two cents. As a result, except for Class C, which maintained its original price, the rest fell by three or five cents. The transaction volume was approximately $200,000 to $300,000. A simplified table is listed below. [Table]</p>
<p>Stock transactions - 300 shares of New Asia Leaf Factory shares were traded at a price of $25.40.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Friday) Dispatch - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British company stocks remained sluggish, with only bank stocks showing a slight decline. The Mercantile Bank of India stock fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence to a price of £8 15 shillings. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation stock also fell by 2 shillings and 6 pence to a price of £11 2 shillings and 6 pence. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower: Single Yarn Sales to Hong Kong Suddenly Active; Double Horse Futures Hover</h3>
<p>The yarn market remains in a state of hovering, with the range of ups and downs particularly narrow. The daily rise and fall is only between three and four yuan, reflecting the generally quiet state of the market. Furthermore, spot yarn transactions are sluggish, but 32-count single yarn priced in Hong Kong dollars suddenly showed signs of improvement, with 235 bales being purchased. Consequently, some in the industry, seeing the active sales of this yarn, are eagerly stocking up, with many making plans for a rainy day. Therefore, the price of single yarn rose by 20 yuan. 20-count and 10-count coarse yarns have not been purchased. 20-count Double Horse yarn had a high price of 1,428 yuan and a low price of 1,423 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the weekend, no opening trading was heard.</p>
<p>Double Horse opened in the morning, and the market was unusually sluggish. The opening price was 1,426 yuan, but there were few transactions on the counter. Some were sold due to Dutch East Indies issues, and it soon fell to 1,423 yuan. Those who made profits slightly covered their positions, and it rebounded to 1,427 or 1,428 yuan. It fluctuated at this price for about one or two hours, but trading in the market was very quiet, with most people adopting a wait-and-see attitude and no activity. The closing price was 1,427 yuan. The transaction volume for half a day totaled 4,635 bales. The amount purchased by each currency port is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 235, Trading Houses 4,400 Total 4,635</p>
<p>The Jin Double Horse standard futures yarn market is even quieter, with very narrow fluctuations, due to people's sluggishness and everyone waiting and seeing. The July futures price rose 5 jiao from the previous day, and the August futures rose 3 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday closure, the morning's transactions were estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<h3>Continued Transactions in Brazilian Cotton; 292 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrive</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation is as calm as ever, with only coarse lint cotton showing more movement. Fine lint cotton, due to continuous export transactions, is very expensive.</p>
<p>Another report from Shanghai says that foreign cotton transactions by foreign firms are good because customers are more diligent in purchasing spot yarn. At the same time, foreign cotton inventories in Shanghai are gradually feeling the lack, and the source of supply is not very smooth. Therefore, all parties are quite willing to purchase, and the market is also showing signs of improvement. In recent days, various industry players and factories have had many transactions in Brazilian cotton, and the market price has risen slightly by about two or three yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was calm and unsettled. Near the close, there was a sudden rise due to purchases by industry players and short covering. Yesterday's closing prices advanced by 4 to 10 pounds each, respectively.</p>
<p>Another dispatch reports the statistics for American cotton from August 1 of last year to June 6 of this year (each bale is 500 pounds):</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially rose due to speculative purchases and short covering, but subsequently fell slightly due to sales by European exporters and profit-taking by longs. As a result, the closing price rose by about one rupee. It is predicted that today's opening market will rise by 0.75 rupees.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign cotton in Shanghai has greatly decreased recently. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Ming Sheng vessel arrived from Hong Kong with 292 bales of Indian cotton, and was docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. (Year)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices are Tight; Futures Market Remains Suspended</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market only had spot transactions, and the trend was tighter. The futures market continues to be suspended due to the lack of a resolution after the meeting. The guild set the price of spot goods: No. 4 coarse white sugar for March arrivals was 93 yuan, unchanged; April arrivals were 93.5 yuan; May new goods were 94 yuan, up 5 jiao; Dutch red new goods were 71 yuan; Taikoo granulated white B mark East Wharf was 106 yuan, up 1.2 yuan; DY mark West Wharf was 95 yuan, up 1 yuan; HX mark remained at 91 yuan; this factory's snow white was 96 yuan; Zhen Ji No. 4 cotton white was 86 yuan; this factory's No. 1 ice was 124.5 yuan; Jing Ming ice was 126 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hainan Dried Longan Slightly Increases</h3>
<p>Hainan dried longan has recently lacked new arrivals, and most stores are unwilling to sell at current prices, so the market is still tight. Yesterday, a small number opened a price of 250 yuan and 1,300 yuan. Stores in the North City called for 260 yuan, indicating a continued tightening trend.</p>
<h3>Coal: Few Transactions of Huainan Coal</h3>
<p>Huainan bituminous coal had smooth sales last month, and the arrival of goods from various places was uninterrupted. Recently, it seems quite quiet, because the demanders have gradually met their needs, and transactions have slackened. Yesterday, only a few transactions opened. Industry players dismantled prices: screened lump coal was 285 yuan per ton, selected lump coal was 305 yuan, and coal dust was 250 yuan. Wharf handling fees from the car line are added separately.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Lanxi Mushrooms on the Market; Agar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Nearly ten pieces of new Lanxi mushrooms have arrived. Plain bundles open at 1,220 yuan to 1,260 yuan, thick mushrooms and large slices at 1,320 yuan, and old plain bundles at 940 yuan. As the market inventory is not thin, they are still quite popular.</p>
<p>The arrival and inventory of agar are not abundant, and it is also the peak season for sales, so the price has turned up. The price of Shangzhuang Tianxue brand is 1,750 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 1,600 yuan, all seeing continued increases.</p>
<h3>Leaf Materials: New Honeysuckle Blossoms</h3>
<p>The honeysuckle season is approaching, and the first batch has already arrived. Because production prices are high, coupled with exchange rate factors, the cost is extremely high. Therefore, the prices quoted by the stores are about 100 yuan higher than the prices quoted by the trading houses, and have not yet opened.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Overcoating Fabrics Are Very Tight</h3>
<p>The overcoating market was particularly tight yesterday, with quotations shouting and raising prices wildly. It is observed that the market inventory is thin, and new arrivals are difficult to obtain, and there is no standard. Missed deadlines, delays, and inability to deliver account for more than two-thirds of what is ordered. In addition, the situation in Europe and the United States is tightening, and future deliveries will be even more difficult, causing everyone to be optimistic and hoard goods. However, domestic factories cannot weave overcoating fabrics, so most industry players are eagerly purchasing early. As a result, the market is particularly tight and prices are rising sharply. Yesterday, Meifeng overcoating was sold for 60 yuan per yard (it was only sold for 32 or 33 yuan in the old winter). Polish full wool overcoating was sold for 80 yuan (it was only sold for 45 or 46 yuan in the past). Cashmere Futai overcoating was sold for 150 yuan (it was only sold for 95 or 96 yuan in the past). 707 plain thick fabric was sold for 28 or 29 yuan (it was only sold for about 20 yuan in the past).</p>

<h3>US Far East Policy Unchanged; Provides Practical Assistance to China; Japan Angered by Ineffectiveness, Blames the US; But Washington Has Responded with Facts</h3>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" editorial said that the Japanese newspapers "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" and "Continental Daily News" published an article on the 6th, claiming that some people in the United States do not want the US government to continue to aid China. Their reason is that US aid to China will cause a Pacific War and thus hinder US aid to Britain.</p>
<p>Aid to China Continues Uninterrupted</p>
<p>If this article represents the thinking of the entire Japanese press and the Japanese people today, then this is enough to reflect Japan's inability to understand the spirit and emotions of the United States today. The United States has already made it clear to Tokyo that the United States will never stop aiding China in order to appease Japan. Now Chongqing has received US aid and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>Fixed Policy Difficult to Change</p>
<p>The United States will not object if Japan is willing to ease its attitude towards the United States. However, the United States will never adopt a fence-sitting attitude because Japan changes its policy. It is a dream if Tokyo believes that Japan's empty talk is enough to make the United States sell out China's legitimate government. We are not shutting ourselves off from the world and speaking out of thin air. If Japanese friends can read the editorial of the New York Daily News of May 12 received here, they will understand.</p>
<p>Prolongation of War is Self-Inflicted</p>
<p>The editorial briefly stated that the Sino-Japanese War has now gained a definite new turning point. This kind of turning point is enough to arouse the pride and hope of countries around the world that support democracy. Last Sunday, a Japanese newspaper made a shocking and frank statement that it is impossible to conquer China. The Honda report stated that Chiang Kai-shek has accepted the United States' assistance and is fighting for democratic countries, and Roosevelt has provided him with guarantees. US officials expressed anger and accused the United States of preventing Sino-Japanese peace, and said that US aid to China is enough to prolong the war. They do not know that Japan's war against China is self-inflicted and will suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Eastern Leader Doubles Efforts</p>
<p>General Chiang Kai-shek is obviously not alone and helpless. The Eastern leader of this world democratic movement has doubled his efforts. We are very pleased about this. We regret that we have no concrete and practical assistance other than empty words of aid and a little monetary assistance. We must redouble our efforts, stop selling oil to Japan, and increase aid to Chongqing. Japan is angry with us for preventing peace, in fact, it wants to induce us to appease them. We must reject it with facts and not just empty words.</p>
<p>Alliance Moves Forward to Fight for Freedom</p>
<p>We must make the world's democratic countries realize an alliance, a permanent alliance rather than a temporary alliance for temporary use. The threats we have received illustrate the necessity of this alliance. We are stronger than isolationists and defeatists. Our strength is fully sufficient to extend possible assistance to both the East and West Oceans to save freedom.</p>
<h3>French Concession 平米 Arrives Daily</h3>
<p>According to the 平明社's news from foreign firms yesterday, the French Municipal Council controlled the fair-priced Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 mixed broken rice handled by various foreign firms. Since last month</p>
<h3>Lung Disease Equipment at Shanghai Hospital Continues to be Moved; Expected to be Completed by Tomorrow; Medical Affairs in the Hospital Are Still Being Maintained</h3>
<p>Shanghai Hospital at 172 Qiqi Road, run by the Shanghai Tuberculosis Association, was suddenly broken into by people leading卞 cars and coolies on the morning of the 6th, moving equipment for treating lung diseases in the hospital. It continued all day, and yesterday (the 7th) morning, about 20 coolies were still moving, and it is expected that it will be moved until Sunday before it can be completed.</p>
<p>Work in the Hospital Continues</p>
<p>An English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reporter visited yesterday morning and saw 60 lung disease patients in the hospital still lying in bed. Work in the hospital continued. A borrowed surgical table has been placed in the operating room, and surgery has been performed twice. Doctors and nurses are all focused on their duties, and do not pay attention to the coolies moving equipment. It is heard that patients lying on hospital beds in the hospital have not been moved, but it is feared that they will not be spared.</p>
<p>Currently Planning to Replenish Equipment</p>
<p>Hospital Director 海静格 recently stated that the hospital's work will not be suspended due to the loss of equipment. Medical treatment continued yesterday, but it is necessary to find ways to obtain some equipment so that work can continue without interruption. It is rumored that the equipment being moved from Shanghai Hospital was originally owned by the Nanshi Municipal Hospital. After the August 13th Incident, it was entrusted to the International Red Cross for safekeeping, and then loaned to Shanghai Hospital. The hospital signed a document stipulating that this equipment would never be transferred to other parties, pending future return to the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Fu Wants to Occupy Leprosy Hospital</p>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" says that soon after the equipment from Shanghai Hospital was removed from the central district, it will occupy the leprosy hospital at 16 Jisi Feier Road, run by the Chinese Leprosy Society. It is heard that a notice has been issued intending to occupy the site of the hospital. It is found that the leprosy hospital is adjacent to a Japanese cotton mill. The hospital houses a total of 104 men, women, old and young suffering from leprosy. The Chinese Leprosy Society originally built leprosy hospitals in the interior, which were destroyed by artillery fire during the August 13th Incident. They temporarily built reed sheds at the current site to house poor patients. There is a small wooden shed at the entrance, dedicated to injecting patients with leprosy treatment oil. According to news yesterday morning (the 7th), the Chinese Leprosy Society has negotiated with the central district to oppose the occupation of the leprosy hospital, but has not yet received a reply. It is believed that the central district wants to occupy the site to build houses for its own use.</p>
<p>The Import Committee of various foreign firms received a telegram from Saigon on the 17th. Since the start of the sell-off, various grain shops and retail rice shops that have imported more than 25 tons can order. Therefore, in the past few days, many transactions have been made. The amount sold by the ten foreign firms, including 達孚, 合義, 愼記, etc., is about 12,000 tons. This ordered amount has been telegraphed to Saigon. It is found that this Saigon broken rice is a futures contract for this month and is expected to be shipped to Shanghai soon. In the future, the quantity needed by this port each month will be supplied by Saigon as requested. The future selling price of this Saigon broken rice will not exceed 87 yuan in national currency per dan.</p>
<p>More Than a Thousand Rice Shops Sell Universally</p>
<p>Since the launch of the fair-priced small milled rice handled by the Public Works Department on the 16th of last month, residents have been happy to buy it. Various groups and organizations have also purchased in large quantities, so that the more than 1,000 retail rice shops in the two concessions would have been deserted if there were no sales of this fair-priced rice. According to statistics from Xiangmao Foreign Firm yesterday, the number of rice shops selling by the 31st of last month was more than 860, and has increased to 1,004 today. Now, almost all the retail rice shops in the two concessions are selling this small milled rice.</p>
<p>Several Groups Request Purchases</p>
<p>Fair-priced small milled rice arrives in Shanghai in a steady stream, sufficient for the food supply of this port and more. In order to facilitate the residents, the concession authorities have lifted the limit on the number of purchases and allowed groups, organizations, schools, and factories to purchase in large quantities for their own use. A request form for group purchases was specially formulated the day before yesterday to facilitate filling in and submitting for review. As a result, dozens of retail rice shops have gone to Liji Foreign Firm to collect this request form. More than ten groups, including Daxin Company on Nanjing Road, have filled it out and sent it for review, and are being reviewed separately.</p>
<p>Spot and Futures Prices for Bulk Purchases of Milled Rice</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession's specially selected small milled rice from Yangon has been widely sold in rice shops in this city. According to news from various rice shops selling Hong Kong rice yesterday, if a group purchases a large amount of Hong Kong rice, the rice shop must report to the Public Works Department, and payment will only be allowed after formal approval. The spot price is 133.5 yuan per bag, and the futures price is 124.7 yuan per bag. If there are changes in foreign exchange, etc., the price will also be slightly changed to compensate.</p>
<h3>Youth Associations Enthusiastically Get Involved; Social Service Work; Summer Hygiene Campaign Held Regularly; Relief for Unemployed, Fundraising for Teachers' Loans</h3>
<p>Christian Youth Associations regularly hold summer hygiene campaigns to promote large gatherings, to help orphaned believers, and to organize small craft home sideline businesses to maintain a poor life. On the one hand, fundraising for teachers' funds is solicited to help elementary school teachers. The following are also recorded:</p>
<p>Hygiene Campaign</p>
<p>The Christian Youth Association believes that with the advent of summer, cleanliness and hygiene are essential for health. Therefore, in addition to holding a summer hygiene essay competition, in order to encourage citizens to pay attention to hygiene, a three-day summer hygiene campaign publicity meeting is specifically scheduled to be held from the 13th to the 15th of this month. In addition to collecting health-related pictures, specimens, movies, books, etc. from all parties, which will be exhibited and screened every day from 3 pm, famous people will also be invited to speak on the essentials of hygiene, give free vaccinations and physical examinations. At 8 pm, there will also be various recreational activities to help. The venue is in the fitness room of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, and preparations are actively underway.</p>
<p>Relief for Unemployed</p>
<p>The association believes that after the war, believers in the interior took refuge in Shanghai, and their lives were under pressure. The poor were helpless, and their situation was miserable. Therefore, two types of small crafts and home sideline businesses were specially prepared, so that the unemployed could temporarily maintain their lives, and those with limited income could reduce their burden. However, at the beginning, they did not dare to engage in it rashly, because they did not know how many believers were destitute, what this move needs, and what kind of craft is most suitable. A special survey form was made and sent to investigate, and design plans were undertaken.</p>
<p>Teachers' Loans</p>
<p>The association previously organized a small elementary school teacher life assistance society because it realized that the lives of elementary school teachers were difficult, and engaged in introducing occupations and conducting academic research. Now, it is recruiting teachers' loans with a fund of 10,000 yuan and organizing a special committee to preside over the process.</p>
<h3>Commercial Staff Will Acknowledge Dismissal; Must Be Unconditionally Hired in the Future; Dismissal Fee Requested for One and a Half Years</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial Press Association held a special joint meeting of directors and supervisors at its association hall on Shandong Road at 3 pm yesterday to discuss the handling of future labor disputes. It was decided that, in order to seek a reasonable solution to this labor dispute as soon as possible, the association will unite with the factory staff to form a unified supreme committee to coordinate the steps for this event.</p>
<p>Concentrate Will to Make a Consistent Demand on the Company. The association produced ten new committee members on the spot, who will meet with the newly produced committee members from the factory to hold a founding meeting in the short term and formally put forward new conditions to the company. It is heard that the content of the conditions includes that the company, due to current difficulties, has no choice but to reduce staff. When the company's business needs to be filled in the future, or when the war ends, the dismissed employees will be absolutely unconditionally hired. The so-called</p>
<p>The minimum dismissal fee will be increased to one and a half years. There are other detailed rules, which will be formally submitted to the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department for transmission to the capitalists on Monday after the Supreme Committee decides and approves them tomorrow. Whether this labor dispute, which has persisted for more than a month, can be resolved smoothly or will deteriorate further will depend on the attitude of the capitalists.</p>
<h3>Finance Committee of Public Works Department Discusses Increasing Donations from Qian Industry; Business is Different from Before; Franchise Fee Should be Paid as Scheduled</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, the Public Works Department intends to increase various franchise fees in order to make up for the budget shortfall, which has aroused dissatisfaction among the Qian industry in the Public Concession. A petition has been submitted requesting the withdrawal of this proposal. The Finance Committee of the Public Works Department held a special meeting at 4:30 pm on the 6th to discuss this issue. It was decided that, in accordance with Article 34 of the Annex to the Land Charter, the franchise fee of the Liu Qian industry should be collected in four installments annually. This increase in donations has been approved by the taxpayers' meeting. In order to make up for the budget shortfall, the donation has been increased from 75 yuan to 120 yuan and has been announced on record. Moreover, the nature of the current business of the Qian industry is completely different from that stipulated in Article 34 of the Annex to the Land Charter. Because their current business is completely the same as that of small-scale banking. Therefore, there is a necessary reason for paying this donation. Therefore, the majority argued that the donation should be paid as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Silver and Qian Industries Receive Tickets on Saturdays; Extended Hours Starting Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to increase the circulation of banknotes and facilitate the acceptance and transfer of various industries, the Silver and Qian Industries Association decided to extend the time for receiving banknotes on Saturdays, which has been implemented starting yesterday (Saturday): (1) The banknote exchange will delay the exchange time on Saturdays by 15 minutes, changing it to starting at 1 pm; (2) The silver and Qian industries will mutually receive banknotes on Saturdays, extending it by one hour from the original time, changing it to until 1 pm; Regarding the United Bank Reserve Association's receipt of Qian treasury checks sent by each bank to the association, it will be received until 2 pm.</p>

<h3>International College of Surgeons Invites China to Participate; General Assembly in Mexico City in August; Mexican Embassy Representative Sends Letter of Invitation</h3>
<p>The Mexican Embassy in Shanghai announced yesterday that the next general assembly of the International College of Surgeons (located in Geneva) is scheduled to be held in Mexico City from August 10 to 14 this year. The college has asked the Mexican government to invite governments and medical institutions of various countries to send representatives to attend the general assembly. The Mexican Embassy in China has been ordered by the Mexican government to invite the Chongqing Chinese National Government and important medical institutions in Shanghai and Peiping, hoping that they will send representatives to attend the general assembly, because surgical medical services are indeed important in China during this extraordinary period. However, because the situation in the East is unstable and the opening date is approaching, the contributions that the college can expect to obtain from this part of the world in normal circumstances will be hindered this year. According to the general assembly, there are several committees, and Dr. Shanghai Mike Lai Gen is also one of the members.</p>

<h3>Bloodshed on Qipu Road: Shen Keming Shot Dead; Assailants Intercept Car and Fire, Stray Bullets Kill and Wound Passersby; Two Perpetrators Apprehended on Scene</h3>
<p>Shen Keming, a 31-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 54 Futian Village, McTyeire Road, currently the manager of Longchang Industrial Raw Materials Company at No. 210 Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road, owned a private car with license plate No. 3679, and employed Deng Gancheng as his driver. Yesterday morning around 8 a.m., after breakfast, Shen took the car to No. 15A Jisi Fei'er Road,</p>
<p>to pick up his friend Hu Yifei and go to his company. Hu was the Chinese comprador of Zhongfu Foreign Firm at Hubin Building, North Suzhou Road. At the time, Hu's younger brother, Sidao, also intended to go out, so they went east together in the car. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Qipu Road and Henan Road, it slowed down slightly when three men suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two of them drew box-type pistols and opened fire on Shen's car, firing more than ten shots in succession. As a result, Shen was hit by bullets in the head and abdomen, and immediately</p>
<p>died in the car. However, the Hu brothers and the driver were not injured. When the shooting occurred, a stray bullet killed Qian Shun'gen, a worker from Wuxi wearing blue cloth clothes (30 years old), and wounded Chen Debao from Yangzhou (30 years old, residing at No. 11 Ziyou Lane, Guangdong Road, engaged in the sack business) in his right leg. Upon receiving the news, the police dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to surround and apprehend the suspects, and on the spot</p>
<p>apprehended two assailants, confiscated a box-type pistol, and took them back to the police station for detention and interrogation. Simultaneously, the bodies of the deceased Shen Keming and Qian Shun'gen were sent to the mortuary for examination, while Chen Debao was sent to the hospital for treatment. It was later learned that the two captured suspects were Hua Hongsheng and Shen Asi, both from Wujin, and are currently under strict interrogation.</p>

<h3>Two Carjackings Occur Within One Hour Last Night</h3>
<p>Two carjacking incidents occurred in western Shanghai last night between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guan Tonglin, the nearly 50-year-old owner of Tongxing Hardware Store on Guizhou Road, residing at No. 16 Zhaofeng New Village, Baileinan Road, owned a private car with license plate No. 10374. Around 10 p.m. last night, he ordered his driver, Zhou Yingtao, to drive the car to take a friend home. Not long after, the empty car was returning when, upon passing Haig Road, three bandits suddenly jumped out of the darkness, each wielding firearms, blocking the way. As a result, they drove the driver Zhou Yingtao away and hijacked the car. About an hour later, the car was found near Zhaofeng Garden. Upon learning this, the car owner sent someone to claim it.</p>
<p>Soon after, another carjacking occurred in western Shanghai. The hijacked car's license plate was No. 3215.

<h3>Dismembered Body Found at Baker Road and Beihai Road; Limbs Severed, Only Torso Remains</h3>
<p>Around 1 a.m. yesterday morning, a bizarre and terrifying murder occurred at the intersection of Baker Road and Beihai Road. It is said that a patrolman from the Public Concession, upon passing the area, noticed a rolled-up cotton quilt by the roadside and became suspicious. Opening the quilt, he was horrified to find a human body inside. However, the head and limbs had been severed, leaving only a section of the midsection, covered in blood and gore. The dismembered body was removed. The case occurred late at night, and the truth is currently under strict investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>Gao Xiaofu Cruelly Drowns His Own Child</h3>
<p>Gao Xiaofu, a 35-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 127 Xiaoshadu Road, married to a woman surnamed Shi, due to the rising cost of living and inability to make ends meet, yesterday morning around 7:45 a.m., while his wife was out working, actually filled a lead bucket with water and immersed his seven-month-old infant in it, intending to drown the child. Gao then left the house. When his wife returned and discovered this, the child was already dead. She immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple police station to investigate and apprehend Gao Xiaofu, but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<h3>Nine-Year-Old Student Wang Shigeng Kidnapped on Way to School in Early Morning; Chartered Car Driver Suspected and Detained for Investigation; Bandits Carjacked a Business Car to Use in Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, kidnappers carjacked a business car from Youning and used it to kidnap a primary school student named Wang Shigeng from Difeng Road in western Shanghai, and have disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the driver of Wang's chartered car was found to be suspicious and has been detained for investigation. At the same time, Youning's stolen car was found beside Kaixuan Road. The following are the details gathered by the reporter:</p>
<p>Wang Shigeng, a nine-year-old student at Xiejin Primary School on Jing'an Temple Road, lives at No. 75 Xicheng Village, Difeng Road. His father, Wang Hancheng, is a shareholder in Jing'an Shopping Mall at Jing'an Temple. Wang usually went to school and back home by chartered car hired by his family, driven by Hao Jinzhang from Jiangbei. This had become a habit. The car's license plate was No. 4008. Wang's older sisters, Lianzhen and Lianfang, also attended the same school as their brother, so they always rode in the same car.</p>
<p>Kidnapped Midway. Yesterday morning around 9 a.m., after breakfast, Wang and his sisters took the chartered car to school. Unexpectedly, when Hao drove to the intersection of Difeng Road and Daxilu Road, four kidnappers suddenly blocked the car with two guns, threatening them in every possible way. They dragged Wang down and forced him onto a business car, No. 18057, which had been parked beside the road, and sped away. The driver, Hao Jinzhang, then returned home and informed his employer, who reported the matter to the Special Police Department, requesting the rescue of his son. After investigation, the driver, Hao Jinzhang, was found to be highly suspicious and was detained for investigation.</p>
<p>Stolen Car Found. Earlier, a kidnapper went to Youning Automobile Company at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Shantou Road in the Public Concession around 8 a.m. and hired a business car. The company dispatched car No. 18057, driven by driver Lin Aben. When they arrived at a certain place in western Shanghai, the passenger, who was actually a bandit, pulled out a pistol and forced Lin out of the car. Afterwards, it is unknown where, three more kidnappers boarded and drove to the scene to kidnap Wang. Later, Youning's stolen car was found around 11 a.m. in front of No. 6 Kaixuan Road.</p>
<h3>Fire on Guizhou Road; Girl Burned to Death</h3>
<p>The landlord of No. 208 Guizhou Road, Chen Shunrong from Ningbo, lived in a room on the front of the third floor, and rented out the rest. The tenant on the rear of the second floor was a Xia Tianren, who worked as a broadcaster and usually left early and returned late. Only his wife was at home. Around 12 p.m. the night before, a fire suddenly broke out in Xia's room. Xia's wife had already fallen asleep, and when she discovered the fire, it was too late to put it out. In an instant, the flames burst through the roof, affecting Chen Shunrong, the landlord who lived on the front of the third floor. Chen's nine-year-old granddaughter was unable to escape in time and was burned to death. When firefighters dug out the body, it was completely charred, a tragic sight. The fire brigade dispatched pump trucks to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was finally put out. In total, two rooms on the front and rear of the second floor, two rooms on the front and rear of the third floor, a drying terrace, a utility room, a mezzanine, and a neighboring drying terrace were burned. Fortunately, the storefront downstairs was not affected.</p>
<h3>Drug Trafficking Den Cracked at the Dahua Hotel; Eleven Korean Suspects Detained; 160 Cans of Opium Paste Seized</h3>
<p>Han Shoushan, a Chinese detective of the Central Police Station, along with detectives Zhu Zhenfei, Huang Hairu, and Ma Guangqi, learned that someone was secretly trafficking in opium in room 411 of the Dahua Hotel at No. 200 Yu Qiaqing Road. They rushed to arrest the suspects and apprehended five Koreans, Liao Shiqin, Hu Biaosheng, Hu Huoyan, Lin Yuwang, and Ren Qinquan; six Chinese, Zhou Shengzhi, Xu Weisheng, Jiang Yongchang, Zhou Ayu, Jiang Qing, and Bian Ailin; the people living at Zhou Zhaoging and Yin Rencong Zheng Hongxing, Xu Xing San; and Yang Xiazhu (17 years old), a prostitute from Huzhou at No. 49 Qihua Shuyu on Shantou Road – a total of eleven people. They seized 160 cans of opium paste, each containing one tael, worth about ten thousand yuan, and 4,000 yuan in cash. It was discovered that these people specialized in transporting opium from Shanghai to the interior, and it was not the first time. They were all taken to the police station. The five Koreans were handed over to the Japanese consulate, and the rest were escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested permission to detain them because the investigation procedures were not yet complete and further investigation was needed before prosecution. After questioning by Xiao Xie-fen, the judge ordered the suspects to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for one week later.</p>
<h3>Recovering Investment Funds from Shanghai and Hong Kong; Bond Issuance to Be Adopted; China's National Credit as a Nation That Always Repays Debts Is Well-Established, Investors Will Surely Be Happy to Purchase</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, recognizing that there are over one hundred million yuan of investment funds in Shanghai and Hong Kong, but lacking proper investment channels, has flowed into the speculative market, causing high prices and severely affecting people's lives. To address this issue of idle funds, in addition to issuing orders to implement the internal transfer and development of real industries, it has decided to recover them through public bonds. The Public Bond Solicitation Committee has been instructed to find ways to handle it. Furthermore, the Chinese government's credit has always been praised by people at home and abroad. For example, Roosevelt's special envoy, Currie, said, "China is a country with outstanding credit." Jones, the chairman of the US Export-Import Bank, said, "China is a country that always repays its debts." It is reported that Huang Renzhi, the secretary-general of the Solicitation Committee, in addition to personally going to Hong Kong to solicit funds, has also sent special commissioners to Shanghai to handle solicitation matters. Those who subscribe to public bonds of 2,000 yuan or more will receive a 2% incentive bonus and special government rewards.</p>
<h3>Rendezvous with a Woman in a Secluded Room; Death Due to Exhaustion</h3>
<p>Ren Yinchang, a 42-year-old Ningbo native, a shareholder in Yongfengtai Customs Brokerage, residing on the upper floor of Chengda Timber Shop at No. 391 Mintini Yin Road, Faubourg, and a disciple of Buddhism at the Xieji Society, had a wife and concubine and children. However, he was licentious and often engaged in extramarital affairs. Whenever he had a large sum of money, he would always go to a hotel with a woman for pleasure. Ren was obese and tall. To prevent a stroke, he often carried this medicinal powder with him, taking it at any time to prevent unforeseen circumstances. On the afternoon of the sixth, at 2 p.m., Ren again went with a woman surnamed Liu, who was nearly 20 years old, to the Hexing Hotel at No. 487 Avenue Edward VII, under the alias Wang Jun, and opened room 45 for fun. He instructed the bellboy to call him at 8 p.m. to return home. However, at 6 p.m., the woman surnamed Liu took advantage of the unguarded moment and ran away. When the bellboy called at 8 p.m. and received no answer, he entered the room and found that Ren had died of exhaustion. He immediately reported to the police. The police found the deceased's card on his body and notified his family. Then, the body was transported to the mortuary. Yesterday, after the examination, Ren's wife, Yu, signed a guarantee and took the body to the funeral home for encoffining.</p>

<h3>Disputes Between Lean and Guoben Schools Resolved Satisfactorily; Lean Elementary School Resumes Teaching Yesterday; Relief Funds Distributed at Guoben Elementary School</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) As of yesterday, the school disputes in this city that have been resolved through the intervention of educational authorities include two schools, Lean Elementary School and Guoben Elementary School. The Dahua News Agency reporter learned the details as follows:</p>
<h3>Lean Elementary School</h3>
<p>Teachers and staff at the Kangnaotuo Road Jiaozhou Road East Private Lean Elementary School, due to the rising cost of living, requested improved treatment. A strike broke out on the 5th. After the relevant parties sent people to mediate, both sides fully understood the importance of children's education. Therefore, the teachers and staff resumed classes yesterday. The agreed-upon conditions are as follows: (1) The school will provide a one-time subsidy of 40 yuan to each teacher and staff member this semester. (2) Teacher contracts will be handled as usual (issued at the end of the semester, and the school will not arbitrarily transfer them due to this request for improved treatment). (3) The school will improve the salary in the next semester. (Depending on the increase in tuition and miscellaneous fees and the number of students, the principle will be to increase the salary of each teacher on average, except for the school's necessary expenses, and it will be calculated on a six-month basis.) (4) In the future, both parties should uphold the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation to promote the development of the school. Teachers and staff should strive to protect the school, and the school should treat teachers and staff with sincerity.)</p>

<p>At Guoben Elementary School, a private school located at Jiaozhou Road and Yuyuan Road, a serious dispute arose over the distribution of relief funds. It is now learned that after the education authorities sent people to mediate and transferred the matter to administrative processing yesterday, the situation eased. As a result of open and honest discussion and consultation between the two sides, a satisfactory solution has been reached. All of Guoben Elementary School's relief funds will be distributed equally among new and old teachers. The relief funds obtained by Zhongxin Elementary School, which is affiliated with Guoben, will also be distributed fairly and reasonably. The school authorities and the teachers and staff have both expressed satisfaction. A dispute has thus been resolved.</p>
<h3>Anshun Elementary School's 20th Anniversary</h3>

<h3>Last Day of the Painting Academy Joint Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Painting Academy, founded by famous contemporary artists in Shanghai, is holding a joint painting exhibition at Daxin Gallery for a week. The number of visitors has been very enthusiastic. The exhibits on display are all valuable. Today (the 8th) is the last day. Art lovers, please don't miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>Visiting Dai Yunqi's Painting Exhibition by Shi Nanchi</h3>
<p>Chinese painting, from the Five Dynasties and the Two Song Dynasties to the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, has undergone many creations by painters in terms of technique and many changes in style, but the consistent viewpoint for thousands of years has focused on the coordination on the screen, the so-called composition , and the activity in brush and ink, the so-called beauty of rhythm. All famous works in history have these elements. To talk about sects without this point is worthless. Mr. Dai Yunqi of Wuzhong has devoted himself to small mountains for 20 years, taught at the Art College, and has many disciples. He has profound research in both Qiuhe and brush and ink. Starting yesterday (7th), a painting exhibition will be held at the Ningbo Guildhall for three days. The fairly large painting hall is filled with beautiful atmosphere. His landscapes are not to say that his skills are profound. His figures, flowers, and birds are also very mature. The rigor of the style, the fluency of the brushwork, and the old-fashioned layout are all very well coordinated. There is neither a phenomenon of standing out nor a trace of imitating the ancients. For example, in several paintings, such as "Xiqiao Leisure," "Returning Boat on Songxi," and "Fisherman's Hermitage in Fenglin," the colors are ancient and bright, the composition is stable and peculiar, and the rhythm is thick and vigorous. It is true that there is a unique skill. Yesterday, on the first day of the visit, "the crowd was small, and no fewer than dozens of paintings were booked. There are still today and tomorrow. Lovers of Dai Jun's works must see it first and then quickly."</p>

<h3>Remarkable Results in Police Spring Games; Fangsega Sets Three New Records; The Two-Mile Race Hongkou Team Wins Two Championships; Hua Police Officer Sun Zhichong Wins Three Championships</h3>
<p>The 31st Public and Boundary Industry Bureau Police Department Spring Games, the final was held yesterday afternoon at 2 pm at the Racecourse. Because the track is grassy, the results are greatly affected. In the open five-item 440-yard grass flying, Fangsega defeated the group with 49.6 seconds, setting a new record in Shanghai, breaking the highest record of 51.3 seconds held by Frank in the Shanghai Chinese and Western Group Track and Field Games, and shortening the 51.5 seconds of Jack Boer in the previous session by nearly two seconds. He can be called the treasure of the conference. The Edward brothers C and F monopolized the championship and runner-up in the 100-yard race, and the results were 10 seconds, which was the same as last year, and was also excellent. In the tug-of-war competition, McLinqi withdrew, and the Hua police participated in two teams. In the first round, they were eliminated by Tawu. The Indian police and the Russian police decided the championship. As a result, the Indian police won straightly. The most eye-catching two-mile team race, You Wen, the head of Hongkou A, reached the finish line first, with a score of 10 minutes and 43.4 seconds (the score of the previous session was 10 minutes and 17 seconds, and the team champion was Dong Saile). Relying on the average talent, he won the team championship with 20 points. Second place, Japan Association 30 points, third place, Huizhen B 50 points, and the National Federation Pei Guang ranked fourth and fifth, but without positions. In the two invitation races, McLinis defeated Xiqing in the one-mile individual medley relay (Xiqing won the championship in the previous session, McLinis won the runner-up, and the score was 3 minutes and 46.5 seconds). Sun Zhichong won the three championships in the Hua police officer's 100-yard, 220-yard, and 440-yard races. Sun also won the chief of the 220-yard race (service for more than ten years) of the Chinese and Western Police, with a score of 14.4 seconds, breaking his own old record of 24.8 seconds. In yesterday's competition, in addition to winning the open 440-yard race, Fangsega also won the chief of the Western Police's 100-yard, 220-yard, and 440-yard races, and the 100-yard race was 9.9 seconds, which was better than the open 10 seconds, and the 220-yard race was 20 seconds, which both broke the highest record of the Chinese and Western Group Games (the 100-yard of the Chinese and Western Group was maintained by Edward with 10.2 seconds, and the 220-yard was maintained by Fang himself with 22.8 seconds). These two items can also be called setting new records in Shanghai. It is rare and valuable to have such amazing results in early summer weather. In the district total score, the Henan District won the championship with 66 points, the Hebei District won the second place with 49 points, and the Russian reserve team ranked third with 7 points. In addition, there were also stilt races, children's races, etc., which were also quite interesting. After the competition, Mrs. Bowen awarded the prizes and dispersed.

<h3>How to Cope with Exams</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunlu</p>
<p>The semester is coming to an end soon! Children are busy preparing for the upcoming semester exams.</p>
<p>No matter what we do, we must have sufficient preparation beforehand in order to obtain satisfactory results. Coping with exams is the same. Before the exam, you must be fully prepared. It is best to create a study schedule based on the exam schedule stipulated by the school and the nature and level of each subject. However, there needs to be a limit, which is to not hinder physical health as the principle. Rest time is absolutely essential. For example, if you stay up late studying the night before the exam, you will not be energetic the next day, and you may even get sick. That is not worth it! When studying, you must be able to grasp the key points and find questions yourself. Or, gather a few classmates and discuss with each other, which can make your understanding more thorough.</p>
<p>The most dreaded thing during exams is panic. If you panic during the exam, even easy questions will become difficult. Therefore, after receiving the test paper, do not rush to start. You should first look through it briefly, do the easy questions first, and then carefully think about the more difficult questions before doing them. If you can't figure something out, it is better not to do it. Do not peek at books or plagiarize others, as that is the most immoral behavior. If the teacher sees it, you will be severely punished! After you have completed the test completely, if there is extra time, review it yourself to see if there are any mistakes. Do not rush to hand in the paper. In addition, you should also pay attention to the cleanliness of the test paper and write neatly, as this is closely related to your grades.</p>
<p>Exams are not difficult or bitter things. As long as you study hard on weekdays and review and organize before the exam, it will not be difficult to cope with them easily. Children! I wish you victory in your exams!</p>
<h3>Children's Health Experimental Institute</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Children! There is good news here to tell you, that is, celebrities from all walks of life have recently established a Children's Health Experimental Institute in Hong Kong. This institution, as its name implies, is an organization that protects children's lives and promotes children's health.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that children are the masters of the country, and the heavy responsibility of building a new China in the future rests on the shoulders of children. However, to ask today's children to be able to take on this heavy responsibility in the future, in addition to being fully adequate in terms of intelligence, they must also have a healthy physique. Therefore, today's training for children, aside from intelligence and morality, physical education is especially important. Otherwise, even with sufficient intelligence, it is impossible to bear the responsibility of building a new China with an unhealthy physique. For this reason, in recent times, various countries in Europe and America have attached great importance to children's health issues, using various methods to promote children's health.</p>
<p>As early as 1937, Xu Shiying, acting chairman of the Central Relief Committee, first sponsored the initiation and started to handle the China Children's Health Experimental Station. Later, due to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the work was suspended. Recently, among the celebrities from all walks of life in Hong Kong, some were the original initiators. Seeing that the experiment of children's health is greatly related to national health and the replenishment of the population after the war, they specifically convened an initiation meeting a few days ago to continue the work, actively promote its realization, and renamed it the China Children's Health Experimental Institute.</p>
<p>After the Children's Health Experimental Institute is formally established, according to the planned plan, the work will be divided into four types: experiment, childcare, publication, and service. Roughly, the experiment aspect will use experimental methods to test whether children's health has improved. Publication is to print various books, newspapers, and magazines related to children's health. Childcare is to open nurseries. Service is to provide services related to children's health, such as medicine, vaccination, and epidemic prevention. Once formal branches are established throughout China, the general children will benefit greatly, which is indeed good news!</p>
<h3>Ice-Selling Boy</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The season tells us that the sweltering summer has arrived again. Streets and lanes will again add a batch of bustling "small merchants" shouting and selling along the way. Children, try to guess, which group of small merchants is it?</p>
<p>They: This group of open-air small merchants, their clothes and shoes are incomplete, some are even shirtless and barefoot, carrying a cloth bag or a small wooden box on their shoulders, filled with a lot of "ice," their small lips opening and closing, shouting all the way: "Ice! Ice! Selling ice!" Under the scorching sun, running ten or twenty miles is nothing. These little "ice-selling boys!" In order to find food to eat and help their parents' livelihood, they work so hard toiling under the scorching sun. How admirable is that kind of "self-reliance" spirit! Children who enjoy comfort and happiness, do you also have the ambition to "self-rely"? No matter what industry, as long as you can be self-reliant and not be afraid of hardship, you will eventually have a day of success! You must remember to study hard and enrich your intangible capital (knowledge and skills).</p>
<h3>Various Functions of Silkworms</h3>
<p>— He Fu</p>
<p>Children! I know that there must be quite a few of you who raise silkworms, but if you randomly grab a child and ask, how do silkworms spin silk? Why do silkworms make cocoons? Why do they turn into silkworm moths after making cocoons? I'm afraid no child can answer. Children only know that silkworms seem to be doing "magic tricks" and think they are very magical. In fact, this is not magical at all. It is also one of the types of animals. A silkworm is a larva, with twelve ocelli distributed on both sides. It has eyes but no organs such as ears and nose. It has five pairs of legs and nine pairs of breathing spiracles. It also has a heart, blood, stomach, and intestines, but the blood does not contain red blood cells, so it is not red. It does not have a brain, but there are nerve nodes in the throat, chest, and abdomen. The hard layer on the outside is its skeleton. Finally, because it has a special organ—the silk gland—that other animals do not have, it can spin silk entirely because of its silk gland. The silk gland is a kind of colloidal liquid, which hardens into silk when it comes into contact with air.</p>
<p>When a silkworm molts from an egg, it has hair on its body. Ordinary silkworms need to molt four times before they can spin silk, make cocoons, and wrap themselves inside. Later, they become pupae. The pupae do not eat or move. After hibernation, they molt again and become six-legged silkworm moths (adults) with wings. The entire body of the silkworm moth is covered with very fine scales, white in color, and the wings often have yellowish-brown markings. Silkworm moths do not eat anything. After laying eggs, they die soon.</p>
<p>Silkworms—in the larval stage, mainly seek food and are nutritional bodies. Because the lifespan of larvae is very short, they need to reproduce, so they spin silk to make cocoons and become silkworm moths. In the adult stage, they do not eat anything and mainly lay eggs, so they are reproductive bodies. The reason why silkworms spin silk to make cocoons is for the sake of reproduction.</p>
<h3>Water Purification Method</h3>
<p>— Xi Dan</p>
<p>The water we drink is "primitive water" from when the earth was opened up hundreds of years ago. What is "primitive water"? Primitive water is what is formed by the combination of two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen. Pure water is a colorless, odorless, and transparent liquid. Water purity can be demonstrated using the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) Water Color Observation Method: Place a piece of white paper on the bottom of a glass cup, pour some water into the cup, and look at it from above. If the water presents a color or is turbid, it is not drinkable.</p>
<p>(2) Smell Method: Boil the water and smell it carefully. If there is a bad smell, it is not drinkable.</p>
<p>(3) Sedimentation Method: Fill a teacup with cold water and leave it overnight. If there is sediment at the bottom of the cup, it is not pure water either.</p>
<p>(4) Litmus Paper Test: Put blue or white litmus paper in the water. If the paper does not change color, the water is pure; if it changes color, it is not drinkable.</p>
<h3>Why Should We Not Spit Everywhere?</h3>
<p>— Mei Qin</p>
<p>Ah Lin saw a piece of paper posted on a pole on the way home from school, with the words "Do Not Spit Everywhere" written on it. Ah Lin often heard the teacher say at school that we should not spit everywhere, and that spitting is a bad habit, but he did not understand the reason for not spitting everywhere. This time, after seeing the paper, Ah Lin immediately felt that he should ask his third brother. Ah Lin went home and immediately dropped his schoolbag to look for his third brother to ask him the reason for not spitting everywhere. The third brother answered any questions Ah Lin asked in detail, and this time was no exception. So, the third brother took Ah Lin's hand and sat together on the bench in the garden. The third brother began to answer this question.</p>
<p>"Generally, people suffering from tuberculosis inevitably have a kind of highly destructive bacteria in their sputum, called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It can destroy normal lungs and make them useless, unable to breathe. If people suffering from this disease spit sputum on the ground at will, after being exposed to the scorching sun, Mycobacterium tuberculosis will fly into the air. When people breathe, it takes the opportunity to enter the lungs and do the job of destroying people's lives. Every year, countless people suffer from tuberculosis because of this, and countless people die because of it! Do you think this is a terrible consequence! Therefore, you must not spit on the road at will."</p>
<h3>Eggshell Handicraft</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Children! You have made paper-cutting and paper-pasting handicrafts, and you have also made bamboo and wood crafts, but have you ever made eggshell crafts? Let me tell you, eggshell crafts are fun and economical. If handicrafts are to practice skill and care, making eggshell crafts will have even greater gains.</p>
<p>If you want to learn how to do it, don't forget to tell your mother to let you crack the eggs when making fried eggs. Let me tell you how to crack them:</p>
<p>(1) Crack a small hole at either end of the egg, let the yolk and white flow out, and wash the eggshell clean before you can work on it. If you crack both ends, cut them flat, paste paper on them, and paint them with colors, you can make a small drum. Paint matchsticks to make drumsticks and a drum rack. It's very spirited. Or cut one end flat, use color to paint landscapes, figures, flowers, and plants, and use colored paper to make a frame, which can be used as a toothpick bottle, exquisite and pleasing.</p>
<p>(2) Crack a hole in the side of the egg, let the yolk and white flow out, cut it flat, paint flowers on it to make a cradle, wind colored silk thread around a lead bar to make a cradle frame, and use silk thread to pierce holes on the edges of both ends of the egg and tie them to the frame, swinging left and right. It's very fun. If there is a small foreign doll sleeping inside, it is even more lifelike. You can also paint scales and fish eyes on the shell, cut paper to make fins, and paste them on the back, abdomen, and tail, making it look even more like a goldfish.</p>
<p>In addition to the above four types, you can also make tumbling dolls, vases, flower baskets, water basins, etc., at will. Just don't forget two points. (1) The eggshell must be washed clean, otherwise the color will not be applied. (2) Soak it in hot water before cutting it to avoid cracking. Children, why not try it on Sunday when you have nothing to do?</p>
<h3>Air Conditioning</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>As soon as the weather gets hot, the advertisements published by various cinemas in the newspapers use the words "Air Conditioning Available" in a very prominent position to attract tourists and audiences. Indeed, in Shanghai, as long as you have money, you will never experience the suffering of heat and cold, because you can turn on the air conditioning in summer and install radiators in winter, making it warm as spring all year round, truly a paradise on earth.</p>
<p>Ah Hui was staring at the two words "Air Conditioning" in a daze. "Air conditioning is of course cold air. Why is it only available in cinemas? When we were in nature class, that teacher said: Air is everywhere. Then cold air is also air, so why is it all taken away by the cinemas, leaving our homes full of heat?" He was talking to himself like this when his brother—Ah Ming—heard him, and he laughed so hard that he couldn't close his mouth, and also said that Ah Hui was a bit silly.</p>
<p>"Brother, you say I'm silly, where am I silly? I think what I just said is not wrong at all. Why are you laughing?" Ah Ming's laugh, of course, couldn't close his mouth, and also said that Ah Hui was a bit silly.</p>
<p>"Air conditioning is not something that just anyone can enjoy in the summer. You must know that there is a very complicated machine installed in the cinema, which is driven by electricity every day, turning the air into a certain coldness, and it consumes a lot of electricity. Therefore, this year, the power company, due to the lack of coal supply, wanted to stop supplying electricity for unnecessary uses. Later, I don't know why, but this plan was cancelled, so this year, the major cinemas still have air conditioning. So how is air conditioning made? To explain this problem, you must first know the properties of water, because the making of air conditioning is entirely based on this property of water to manufacture this air conditioning machine. To boil water, you only need to heat the water to 212 degrees Fahrenheit. However, in the high mountains, the water boils before 212 degrees Fahrenheit. From this experiment, you can know that the boiling point of water is not always 212 degrees Fahrenheit, but shrinks with the pressure of the air. For example, if the air pressure is high, the boiling point is high. Conversely, if the air pressure is low, the boiling point is low. Therefore, the air pressure in the high mountains is of course lower than on the ground, so you don't need to heat it to that temperature to boil the water. Air conditioning uses this property. In a sealed pot, fill it with water, and use a vacuum pump to pump out the air inside. The pressure on the water becomes smaller, and the boiling point does not need to reach 212 degrees Fahrenheit. If you completely pump out the air and the pot becomes a vacuum, the water will boil at 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, pump this water into the room, which can make the air in the room colder, because water boiling at 60 degrees Fahrenheit does not generate heat, but it needs heat when it boils. It takes heat from the air, so the heat in the room is completely absorbed by it, and then it becomes cool. However, there must be a regulating machine in the room to keep the air temperature at around 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and the air is constantly circulating, without any dust or debris, so there is no special odor. In fact, in the summer, sweating more is very comfortable as long as you take a bath. If you don't sweat in the summer, there is a risk of getting sick. In air-conditioned cinemas, although it feels very cool for a while, when you come out of the cinema, you feel stuffy and hot. If you are always exposed to the sunlight, you don't feel that hot. This kind of cold and hot alternation is most likely to catch a cold, which is of course detrimental to your body."</p>

<h3>Talking About Today's Shanghai Shanghai Opera Scene</h3>
<p>— Qian Di</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai Shanghai Opera scene seems to be launching new movements, opening up new paths, and showing new attitudes. We should express our sincere joy and unlimited respect for those artists who are enthusiastic about promoting and improving Shanghai Opera. Because Shanghai Opera in Shanghai has a universal potential force, it holds a large number of audiences, and these audiences mostly belong to the lower and middle classes. If measured in general terms, after film and Peking Opera, it is probably Shanghai Opera's turn.</p>
<p>Currently, the Shanghai Opera troupes performing in Shanghai include the New World Shanghai Opera Theater, Xianshi, Wing On, Great New World, Great World, New Capital, Great China, Orient, and the Queen's Theater. The four venues of "New World", "Xianshi", "Wing On", and "Great New World" are all attached to entertainment venues, and they only take the silver given by the venue. Although the audience still needs to buy tickets separately when entering the venue. The four venues of "New Capital", "Great China", "Orient", and "Queen" are all independent troupes. The leader of "New Capital" is Shi Chunxuan, who is currently busy shooting the film "Yan Ruisheng" for a film company: The "Shi Family Troupe" has a bit of history in the past. Mr. Shi is not only an artist, but also quite knowledgeable. The plays he sings have a cultural atmosphere and should belong to the Liu Chunshan and Zhang Ye'er school, specializing in "mocking and scolding people," and winning the praise of most audiences. The leaders of "Great China" are Xiao Wenbin and Wang Xiao Xin. Mr. Xiao has appeared on the screen, "Virtuous Daughter-in-Law" is his debut, and "Hate Sea Difficult to Fill" is his first shot. The record company also wants to invite him to record records. He can be called the top red person in today's Shanghai Opera scene. However, what we regret for him is that he always sings the same old "Snowy Night Orphan Girl" and "Reborn Couple" routines, without any new spirit, and he may inevitably be eliminated in the future. The leaders of "Orient" are Wei Mingqi and Shi Xiaoying. Mr. Wei is gifted in acting, and his singing and stage steps are different from others, forming a separate school in the Shanghai Opera scene. Finally, we want to talk about "Queen." "Queen" is very young, full of vigor, and appears completely with a new attitude. The cast it currently has is quite strong. Wang Yaqin, who has appeared on the screen and is praised by the media, is the leader of the troupe. The path they are taking is to try to turn Shanghai Opera into film. For example, the recently performed "Peacock Flies Southeast," "</p>
<h3>Lan Lan's Retirement</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>Lan Lan suddenly has the intention of retiring. He told reporters that he will not perform on stage starting next week because a tumor has suddenly grown on his ribs and there are signs of pleurisy. Following the doctor's advice, he had to take a temporary rest. Lan Lan has been engaged in stage work since the end of the war, and has worked very hard, and her acting skills have reached perfection. She has also given audiences a good impression on the screen. Her retirement is a loss to the art world. Street Angel," as well as the upcoming "Broken Heart Flower," are almost all moved down from the screen. New drama circles such as Yue Feng, Mei Xi, Lu Chen, and Ge Ge are all fully participating, taking on the roles of screenwriters and directors. For the makeup of the actors, the set design of the stage, and the configuration of the lighting, he also hired experts.</p>
<p>The recent situation of the Shanghai Opera scene is probably like this. Here, I am reminded of a remark made by the leader of the Ziyun Troupe, Yun Ziyun:</p>
<p>"It is difficult to sing Shanghai Opera, and it is even more difficult to sing Shanghai Opera at this time and in this place, because on the one hand, we must adapt to the environment, and on the other hand, we must sincerely take out our conscience, and we cannot say one word less or one word more."</p>
<p>This is very true. However, I also have hopes for the artists in the Shanghai Opera scene:</p>
<p>"We must grit our teeth and get through this difficult situation. We cannot be tempted by profit, and we cannot be subdued by force. We must always stand on the original position of art and work hard! When you are on stage, whether you advise people to be filial, loyal, or to have a firm will to preserve their integrity, in short, do not contain toxins, and do not harm the bodies and minds of the audience.</p>

<h3>Guolian Films "Beauty Island"</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>Since fashion films have re-emerged in the Shanghai film scene, the production direction of each company has immediately tended towards new styles with reality as the theme. Although, this trend was even stronger before the war.</p>
<p>Of course, we are still pleased that the entire film industry can extricate itself from the whirlpool of so-called folk films, and in a further expectation, we hope that the scope of topics in fashion films will be broad, and no longer need to follow the formula of romance between men and women. In this era, this society, this humanity, there are many bloody stories!</p>
<p>Wu Yonggang's "Red Tears in the Iron Window" has won the appreciation of a wide audience because of its realistic theme, so Yue Feng's "Moon Missing Flowers Broken" after "Blue Sea and Blue Sky" is also a stimulating work exposing the dark bones and blood of the current society.</p>
<p>"Moon Missing Flowers Broken" will begin filming in a week, and Yue Feng has been busy with the work of dividing shots in the past few days.</p>
<p>At this time, the authorities of Guolian Company gave Yue Feng a fashion script, titled "Beauty Island," asking him to revise it and produce it after "Moon Missing Flowers Broken."</p>
<p>The title of "Beauty Island" seems a little soft, but according to those who have read the script: the content is full of exciting sense of justice, describing a patriotic story of overseas Chinese in the South Seas!</p>
<p>Let's look forward to it: fashion films with bones and blood will make the lonely film scene bloom with splendid angry flowers!</p>

It is reported that the Weiyu Group of friendly countries, Qingguang, Guanghua, Jingwu, Qingyun, Qingnian, Zhongying, Hualian, Qinghua, and Baolian will participate in the preliminary round, and Mr. Shan Lianxuezheng and Mr. Tao Peizhi will be the referees.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 1 The First Display of Gongsun's Sword Qi</p>
<p>By the time they reached the mountain, the east was already white. The two men were drenched in sweat from running. Liu Yinying was very anxious, fearing that his aunt might wake up early. As soon as they reached the house, the two men quietly jumped in, each returning to their own room without a sound. Xu Jing, back in his room, was naturally unable to fall asleep. He hung the Crimson Phoenix Sword on the wall, changed his clothes, and sat there, carefully considering what had happened earlier. It was too coincidental. Liu Yinying actually followed him to the Wang family. And he happened to encounter an assassin who was captured by him. No wonder Wang Yongtai admired him. As for his own skills, they were really too poor. How could he not have noticed Liu Yinying following behind him, or the theft of the precious sword? Liu Yinying's skills are truly admirable, and his personality is gentle and courteous. Such a friend is extremely lovable. Unexpectedly, he suffered a setback at the Wang family but got to know a hero. Compared with Zhang Cangqiu, one is overly bold and rash, and the other is charming and lovable. Both are my respected friends. How fortunate am I, Xu Jing, to have encountered them? As he thought for a long time, he suddenly heard Liu Yinying knocking twice on the door, calling out, "Brother Jing, Brother Jing, are you awake?" Xu Jing immediately woke up from his dream and quickly got up and opened the door. Liu Yinying had already changed his clothes. Xu Jing said with a smile, "I was just about to get up. My aunt has already risen. Why didn't Brother Jing open the door? I thought you were still sleeping soundly, so I called you several times." Xu Jing said, "Last night, I walked back and forth quite a bit and felt very tired, so I was sitting down to rest. Brother's skills are really superb, far superior to mine, leaving me far behind. I will have to ask you for advice from time to time in the future. Congratulations." Liu Yinying smiled slightly and said, "There are many talented people in the world, and I am just a drop in the ocean. What is there to talk about?" The two then sat down and talked in detail about what happened last night. Liu Yinying also inquired about Xu Jing's past with Wang Yongtai. Xu Jing then told him everything truthfully and apologized to Liu Yinying, saying that he did not want to publicize the matter at first, so he lied to him, and asked him to forgive him. Liu Yinying sighed and said, "One should never listen to slanderous words. I can't help but blame Wang Yongtai for his recklessness, which almost wronged a good man. No wonder Brother Jing wanted to do this. This matter is very straightforward. Facts speak louder than words. Wang Yongtai must understand now. (84)</p>
