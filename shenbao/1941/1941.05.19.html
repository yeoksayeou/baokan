<p>社評</p>
<h3>近東的新危機</h3>
<p>隨着維希再度對德屈服之後，近東戰事益形擴大和複雜化；英方已對於供給德國軍事便利的叙利亞採取敵對行動，伊拉克的英空軍亦開始與新近到達的德機交綏，另據伊方聲稱：伊軍已越過外的但前綫及的但河，巴勒士坦且有已遭侵入之說。以此種種和十三日德方宣布紅海爲戰爭區域一舉對照，可見希特勒正在處心積慮在近東與英一角雌雄，英國所遭威脅顯已較前此更形嚴重。</p>
<p>檢討這一局勢的發展，首先不能不致憾於英方之未能確切把握住主動地位和時間因素。伊拉克戰事的爆發本是英軍先發制人的一幕，儘管蓋蘭尼在戰事初起時已向德國呼籲，納粹却並未能迅速赴援，如果不是維希當局的對德「合作」，到此際恐怕還在覓取援伊的進路。在那兩週時日之中，相信近東英軍確具有敉平米索不達美亞變局的實力和可能，然而在事實上，却除了死守一二據點而外竟無所進展，一直相持到德法談判的完成，姑不論這是吾另自有其困難所在抑或誤認伊當局不難以坐困而屈服，在戰略上已經落後了一着。英人旣已認淸寗使莫索爾油田全告破壞，亦勝於被納粹所安然攫取，何以竟坐視時日的推移？即使至今英軍仍具有控制近東全局的充分自信，至少在目前應付這一繁複紊亂之局，較前當已大費周章。</p>
<p>英國之經營近東，從勞倫斯在阿刺伯活動算起，迄今已有將近三十年的歷史，儘管其間經過了若干離合和變化，在政治經濟和軍事方面，却都已樹立下深厚的根基。歐戰開始後，更在此一隅屯駐重兵，由近東軍總司令華維爾爵士在巴勒士坦坐鎭，加以英海軍始終控制着東地中海的海權，是以縱在叙利亞已不再是抗德根據地之後，英方仍舊佔有絕對的優勢，遠非軸心所能此擬。現在德國已在叙利亞獲得運兵假道的便利，而該地距離德義最近的根據地不下五百浬之遙，加以塞浦路斯的海軍要塞橫亘在叙利亞沿岸不遠，德義運渡大軍絕無可能。預料納粹所可能運用的辦法當不外在天空方面—輸送空軍和部隊，假如英方防範周密，亦非等閒所能奏效。事之可慮到在於這一戰事以擴大的形勢相持下去，那一地區內部所包孕着的種種問題巴勒士坦的猶回爭執曾使英國爲之困擾多年，近兩年雖暫歸平靜，但那一爭執並未獲有解決；醖釀已久的泛阿刺伯運動，一向把英國看成進行途徑中的障碍，同時也正是軸心方面所竭力設法利用的目標，現在雖然這一運動的首腦漢志阿刺伯國王伊平薩和德始終還站在英國方面，以回敎救主自命的墨索里尼也因爲併吞阿爾巴尼亞引起了回敎徒的普遍反感，但此决伊拉克的行動已顯屬甘爲納粹輿臺，葉門更一向和侵略國家相結託，與義大利具有深切關係，更何况因爲歷史上種種惡因的積纍，即使若干頭腦淸新的回敎徒並不把納粹勝利視爲自族解放運動所寄託，對於英國的勝利却也不感覺何等興趣，一遇到適當時機，難免爆發自謀獨立解放的行動，即使那並不是德義所策動，亦當使英方遭受重大困難，最近英軍在伊拉克之遲遲不進者也許就是爲了避免過分刺激阿刺伯人的觀感，不肯操切從事，預料軸心方面一方進行軍事上的運用，同時必更以最大努力從事宣傳和鼓動，已往之見於捷克與南斯拉夫者，未必不再見於近東代管地和阿刺伯半島，這種危脅也許比軍事上的應付更可慮。</p>
<p>爲今之計，只有切望阿刺伯族人深切認明任何弱小民族斷不能從侵略者的勝利之下得到任何利益的保障，無論主觀上抑或客觀上爲虎作倀的行爲只有自貽伊戚。當地英當局亦當深切注意到一般居民的情緒，善爲補救歷史上的愆允，那種傳統的殖民地政策只令在危急之秋增加自身的困擾。在軍事上，則必須當機立斷，迅速克服種種潛在的危機，把近東大局穩定下來。固然，有如邱吉爾前此所云，英德最後的角逐繫於大西洋的決戰，如果納粹此際確在殫精竭慮發動近東大戰，那正證明他對於大西洋和英倫海峽還有充分把握，不過，像伊拉克油田和蘇彝士運河雖關係重大，尙屬有形的得失，更値得寳貴的却是英帝國的威望，假使在巴爾幹之役不遭受失敗，也許維希對德可能更强硬些吧？這一嚴重關頭，幸願英當局能夠縝密靈活的作有效的應付。</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（五六）</p>
<h3>倫敦大火記</h3>
<p>的在十點鐘的時候，我們尋着一個頭髮漆黑，光亮異常的年輕車夫，他說自己很願意一觀火景，所以肯送我們到任何地方去。他又聽說火燄已向聖保羅敎堂進攻，市政廳已經起火，在我們到達以前，或者已毀成瓦礫了。</p>
<p>我們叫他驅車向天空最紅的方向駛去，然後再往聖保羅敎堂。</p>
<p>我們把車後的窗放下，從窗外觀看天空。車子轉灣時嗅着第一陣火燒氣味。城市的火，普通常帶着强烈的橡皮氣和柏油屋頂的焦苦氣。但這一决却一些也嗅不到這種氣味</p>
<p>車行不久，我們到了警察阻斷交通的一條街上。車夫把車停住，我們把新聞記者的通行證從車窗口仲出來。警察舉手行禮，便揮手叫我們過去。這於車夫的印象狠是深刻。他當我們不過是兩個貪圖眼福的無事忙，却不知道我們竟是新聞記者。以後每到警察的警戒綫，他就伸出窗外鄭重的說道，「我們是新聞記者。」但是街道已討救火車阻住，因此我們一不得不停下車來，步行前進。我們見火起於素所熟悉的一所房屋，都感到驚駭。那是一座六層樓，原是一家報館一家通訊社的所在地。頂層正在燃燒，火星四射，屋頂已坍下了。我們兩人曾有好幾决進過這屋，坐在堆滿文稿的寫字檯邊，和認識的新聞記者談話。底層的窗戶都是一團漆黑，除了皮帶射水之聲，和澆在燒紅了的樑木上所發出之爆裂聲外，四周都很寂靜。</p>
<p>消防隊員吿訴我們說，火勢正不可向邇，已有穴所敎堂起火。馬格利提議去看她所愛到的敎堂是吾安全無恙。這所敎堂在一排陳舊多鼠的房屋中央，是一所小巧美麗的建築，但在我們跑近時，所見的就像賀年片中聖誕節前夕的敎堂一樣，祇見牠黑暗的一面，窗中有聖火透出，不過火光閃爍，使人不安罷了。大的是消防隊員把敎堂的大門開着，火光也從門中射出。我們不避炎威，儘量的走近大門，看那敎堂恰像一座烘爐。屋頂巳經坍下，發光的樑木掉在燒成灰燼的聖座上面。我們一面眼看這座宏偉的建築物燒成瓦礫，一面也想戰事一過，人民必踴躍輸將，重建一座更偉大的敎堂。可是馬格利已目擊心傷，不忍再看下去了。</p>
<p>我們的四周都是烟火氣息，馬格利並說這氣味很是奇特，那不是平常木料的氣息，而有些香味，二百五十年前倫敦第一决大火後所用橡木樑柱的氣息，還有數百年來支持大英帝國各大商業公司的古代紀錄的焦臭氣混雜其間，天下沒有再比火燒倫敦所得的玫瑰香味再貴重的了。我們走回車子時，那種香味還纏繞衣際呢。</p>
<p>我們駛向聖你羅敎堂時，經過一條街道，街上救火皮帶縱橫蟠曲，有如灰色的粗鏈。我們小心駕駛，在擠滿了車輛的間隙中穿過，不得不時行時止。這類情景，我希望一生中不要再見。除了我們的汽車而外，其餘的都是救火車，—無非是皮帶車和裝載抽水機，撓鉤，梯子的車輛—緩緩地駛入前面的火塲。</p>
<p>我們轉到一條小巷，下車步行。那此些彬彬有禮的英國警察雖未迫令我們停車，我們有着派可，也可以再向前進，心上似說不過去。汽車夫說他從未見過這種類似的悲壯景象，將來也不願再見。我們走下車來，他也跟在後面，相離祇有兩步，我們都始終沒有覺得。</p>
<p>我們方出車門，就覺風勢很大，馬格利的裙子吹得飄了起來，紙片隨風在舞。我用手緊緊壓住頭戴的呢帽，但我到電影院時，並不會討厭戴帽子。那風是突然來的嗎？我們在走過那幾幢房屋以前，還禾曾留意到有風呢！</p>
<p>教們折入聖保羅敎堂的方塲，見大敎堂尙安全無恙。我們隱的辨出屋頂瞭望員在穹窿之下巡邏。但是敎堂後面的街道巳經起火，右邊的建築物也有隨時傾圯之虞。正對禮拜堂的那一面，仍是黑暗，而火光熊熊，却偶一從窗戶中透出。</p>
<p>我們穿過救火的梯子，跨過蜷曲的皮帶，兜到後面燃燒的街道，一看火景。</p>
<p>那是汚穢的商業區。我們很吃驚地立在一家小珠寳店鬥前，見黑色牆壁的一個空隙中，伸出一條小而白的火舌，照耀全室，像一盞幽暗的電燈。正在看時，牆上又有一塊灰泥掉下，接着便有火舌透出。此後火舌愈見愈多，全部牆壁轉瞬起火，珠寳盒中的金銀首飾在火中閃爍發光。這是一家小珠寳店，祇有窮人難得購買的首飾。裏面還有兵士買給女人的結婚戒指和女人買給兵士的鏡框。</p>
<p>珠寳盒中常有純白的光芒射出，迅即不見。這店巾的熱度一定很高，櫃檯上有如鬼火飛舞，這或是珠寳爆裂，但說是賽瑯珞製的梳刷突然發火，似乎更像一點。</p>
<p>櫉窗裹面手錶的帶子，像蛇一樣的在火中扭動，鏡框上的豬皮也在脹裂。這店的主人在那裏呢？明日歸來，見他的店屋已付之一炬，又將怎樣呢？假使我們將櫥窗打碎，把他的寳物取出一些，我們又怎能辨別什麼値錢，什麼小値錢呢？（未完）</p>

<h3>米煤均已跌價　民生有昭蘇之望　盼望當局持久執行功令　米價不難跌進百元以內　米囤房貶價與當局爭售將有良好之應付</h3>
<p>兩租界區內各號、向工部局批購洋米者、約計七百四十餘家、除已有六百余家米號、亦將於今日赴祥茂洋行繳付款項、並向堆棧提取貨物應市、故自今日起、兩租界區內各米號、將全部出售工部局所訂購之洋米、</p>
<p>囤戶貶售　平民獲益</p>
<p>上週未之米價、因受工部局所辦港米及仰光米大量湧到、存底益厚、暨滬仰綫水脚减低之影響而猛跌、市上小絞米價、較工部局所規定之價格、尚低落七元左右、記者昨特以此事是否將影響工部局洋米之銷數、向關係方面探詢、據稱、本市囤戶、感於所囤大宗米糧、因工部局廉價洋米出售時無法銷售、於是競相貶價求脫、乃跌至工部局洋米價格以下、此種現象、非特早為當局所預料、目亦係當局舉辦廉價港米之目的、因大囤戶愈貶價求售、則市民愈可獲得更為低廉之食米也、</p>
<p>米價差額　將予改善</p>
<p>惟目下大囤戶貶售之米價、與工部局所訂之米價差數懸殊、當局將有良好之辦法、予以改善、務使市民能獲得最低廉之食米、又據米號業某君稱、未及辦畢付款手續之百餘家米號、今日將前往辦理提貨手續、決不致因市塲米價較工部局洋米價格低廉而中止提貨、</p>
<p>二批港米　日內運滬</p>
<p>工部局向香港採辦之港米、昨日又由英商怡和公司裕生輪載來一萬包以上、該輪於昨晨九時停泊新開河外灘碼頭、中午開始卸貨、工部局由港訂購之米糧、第一批為五萬五千懈、第二批之總數為二萬四千一百十二包、前後總數達七萬九千餘包、聞太古公司之嘉應輪及岳州輪、亦裝載工部局港米、可於日內抵滬、又據記者探悉、立基洋行為防止有人購囤工部局洋米起見、將於今日發給出售米糧之登記簿一本、命各米號按日登記出售工部局洋米之數量、以備查考、</p>
<p>廉米買賣　須遵法令</p>
<p>廉價港米刻已於兩租界內各合法米號門市部開始轉售、市民須遵章購米、嚴禁糾衆騷擾、或故意藉口、同時各經售米號、有不遵章賣米者、購米平民可逕向當局舉發、茲悉當局鑒於發售港米、純係抑平米價、解除平民倒懸為宗旨、並為杜絕流弊起見、已遺屬分赴各經售米號密査、如經發覺各米號有違法行為者、決將拘捕依法究辦、但据報吿、昨有少數米號遇升斗小民糶平價米、均以有價無米答復、最低米價、仍售一百十六元、如果屬實、誠米市懸牌跌價聲中之怪現象、當局應査明實在情形加以糾正、</p>
<p>小絞米將　進百元關</p>
<p>昨據某米業巨子語人稱、本市民食恐慌、頃已漸成過去、居民對於民食隱憂、亦可解除、照渠觀測、本市各擋米價、將繼續下游、小絞米不日卽可進百元大關、目前米市塲非法交易、已無形消滅、下午米糧買賣、亦經當局晉陞加禁止、故一般投機米商、現已黔驢技窮、顯已無法繼續活躍、渠又稱運米水脚、不久卽將絡繹遞減、本市民食前途、將漸入佳境、</p>
<p>兩當局諭　抑平煤市</p>
<p>烟白煤斤市價、前內投　煤市儈作祟市塲、曾一度至歴所罕見之頂高峯、昨據各煤業公團消息、兩租界當局鑒於煤斤市價節節上升、純係投機操縱壟斷所　、並煤價頻漲、其影響平民生計、及社會治安、殊不亞米糧、兩當局除積極設法增加裝煤航輪外、茲曾邀集各大煤公司負責者、勸諭顧全社會治安、與當局共同合作、勿再視烟白煤斤為投機物品、繼續居奇抬價、並諭無論各類烟白煤斤售價、一律不得再繼續抬高、如經査覺有擅抬煤價、當局決將依法究辦、不稍寬貸、俾儆其餘、而安市况、</p>
<p>煤球暗盤　已經跌價</p>
<p>今悉運煤航輪、現已較前增多、煤運水脚、各輪公司自　核减、並嗣後煤斤來源、將愈益湧旺、持貨及持單煤商頗進退維谷、咸將所有現貨或棧單、抑價求脫、其在市塲一般交易、至為狼狽、惟頗鮮人問津、茲二號聞平塊每噸由四百元已跌至三百七十五元、同得利白煤由四百五十六元跌至四百四十元、至於煤球暗盤、已進三百元關、華通棧單、猶乏人顧問、</p>
<p>最近成交　廿餘萬噸</p>
<p>昨據各煤公司方面消息、印度安南產煤區產價低落、一般煤商、為未雨綢繆計、已紛電海外產煤區訂購大宗烟白煤斤、刻已改先後正式成交者、已達二十一二萬噸之譜、在斯半月內、卽將裝輪啟運來滬、據悉其中以製造煤球所需之煤屑約佔其半、又據某煤業巨子稱、本市烟白煤斤存底頃愈益充沛、總達四十三萬噸左右、</p>

<h3>孤兒的樂園（一）柳</h3>
<p>孤兒，是兒童最不幸的遭遇；我也是十一歲喪父，賴母氏鞠育成人，可憐我童年，見到有父親的孩子，融融洩洩，回想到我的父親那裏去了，每不覺淚珠奪眶而出。</p>
<p>殘酷的戰禍，無端地加到人衆身上，正不知多多少少，家破人亡，飄泊流離，孤人之兒，寡人之妻，罄南山竹，寫不盡這凄凉慘痛的景象；傾西江水，那裏能洗盡心頭杌隉的情緒。人世間，旣平添了無數的無父的孤兒，流浪着，飢餓着，不幸的殉於溝壑，幸運的得遇着救星，我今所談的正爲不幸而幸的一個孤兒。</p>
<p>原來是，我家鄉，戰事頻頻。有楊姓的，是經紀人家，一家五口。男的是，小店經理，本可以安閒度日；却不料屢遭戰事，全鎭爲墟。不能例外的楊，廬舍蕩然，店產烏有，一急一氣，就是一命嗚呼。遺下的一妻三兒，在中國以男子爲生產單位的經濟組織下，到了這地步，做女子的眞是手足無所措，哭哭啼啼濟恁麼事。後來經過種種設法，大的兒子，薦入小商店去當學徒。最小的女兒，就螟蛉給人家。自己出來幫傭。尙留一男孩，寄食在人家，但以一百四五十元一石米，每月至少幫膳一三十元，叫她如何擔負得起，這一問題不解決，又叫她如何得了！後來得着朱志堯先生玉成其事，居然將這孩子送進了土山灣的孤兒院——慈雲小學。她們一家四口，雖是分居了四處，可是各有了安身之所，眞所謂徼天之幸，如天之福。</p>
<p>有一天早晨，日暖風和，朱志堯先生借了一輛汽車，我即挈帶那孩子，三人同車，風馳電掣，打那柏油路上好似軟茵般飛駛過去，不久，望見徐家匯天主堂的雙塔高峙，我們的車就對那鐘樓直駛前去，一會兒到了法租界西端的徐家匯鎭上。矍鑠老翁的朱志堯先生，竟不用雇街車。於是一老一壯一小，舍車步行，度小橋，穿鐵絲網，踏進了敎堂區，沿着汚濁不堪的蒲肇河，與路旁敎堂的粉牆堊壁相映，黑白分明，更顯出天主敎十潔白的精誠。經過敎堂門外，高聳的兩鐘棋，較以前所望見的更形親切了！不禁回想到十四年前，曾一度得朱炎之先生介紹引導我們一小部分人，參觀天主堂的圖書館及天文儀器，可是走馬看花，况且是天文臺遠在佘山，我們所看到的，僅關於地震等一小部分儀器。我雖亦可說，上海是我第二故鄉，但是我到徐家匯敎堂區，還以這一次爲第一决。一路上說說談談，抬頭看見白牆上士山灣一大字，目的地已到了。河上跨一座橋名慈雲，是米志堯先生所承造，可說是南市第一座水泥鋼架建築的鐵橋，如今已數十年了，當時只費了二百兩銀子，路旁即是土山灣孤兒院了。一進了門，即有態度和靄的司閽出而招呼。這一點，又使我起了一種感想，我也喜到寺廟裏去隨喜，然而那僧侶何等勢利；我也曾到團體塲所去參觀，然而那營門的何等神氣；其實這種人目光太糢糊了；人，同是人，何必彼此分厚薄，只認衣衫不認人，豈是社會中所應有的人情呀！</p>

<h3>我國現階段勞資衝突  紀澤</h3>
<p>簡單的說，勞資衝突是勞資雙方因利益之分配不均而引起的爭執。這種利益的不均，遠始於私有財產制度後之奴隸制度時代，然當時生產力薄弱，民智未開，故主奴之間無听謂衝突。至產業革命後，生產力大增，工資制度發達，同時勞資間利害之衝突漸臻嚴重，情感日疏，貧富之歷殊日甚，馴至勞資雙方各自成爲一大階級。近代隨着產業之展，生活程度遂漸提高，物價亦增加不已，工人生活日感痛苦，外加思想上之變遷，於是必然的造成勞工階級的團結，與勞資衝突的發生。</p>
<p>我國不是產業發達的國家，而是個充滿着半殖民地半封建的特質的國家，在這種社會裏發生的勞資衝突，當然不會與資本主義國家的盡同。她有她的特質；允其在國難殷迫的今日，勞資雙方利害相同，立塲一致，光明燦爛的前途，同樣建築在爭取民族解放的基礎上，所以當務之急，是在建立勞資統一陣綫，決不是在雙方自深塹壕，以致造成內江的悲劇。</p>
<p>勞資衝突的內容</p>
<p>勞資衝突的原因，大的可分爲經濟方面的與管理方面的二種：</p>
<p>（一）經濟方面的爭執卽勞資雙方對於和潤分配的爭執。在商業循環衰落期中，物品價格下跌，而原料等成本則所低甚微，企業利潤减少，資方爲維持企業之在存及資本之經常利潤起見，乃籌擬减薪；反之，在百業景氣時與，允在戰時，百物昂貴，幣値貶低，產品價資飛漲，存貨價値大增，而人工成本則相對的减少，結果資方因此機會而獲利倍蓰，勞方則反受其殃而叫苦連天，蓋幣値貶則生活費用增，其收入猶以過去之貨幣價値標準估計，故眞實工資陡减，生活至爲窘迫，乃要求增發津給，希望在企業之優厚利潤中霑得台理之部份。若前一情形發生而爲勞方反對，後一情形發生而爲資方拒絕，則爭執在所不免，馴至罷工歇業，陷生產於停頓。</p>
<p>（二）管理方面的衝突，其重要性亦不亞於經濟利益的衝突，且二者有密切的關係，管理的缺陷在科學不發達的國家，特別容易發生，與感情用事的國民性亦有關係。所謂管理方面的爭執，有工作時間的爭議，上級職員對下屬的暴戾態度的糾紛，工作情形及物質設備的要求改良，僱傭及解僱問題異議，及關係勞動協的的糾葛等，這種衝突的延不解決，同樣可擾亂生產的進行。</p>
<p>我國自民十七國府成立後，勞資衝突即漸趨减少，此中原因，半由於經濟蕭條，半由於國府之採行十涉政策，如修正勞資爭議處法等之通過施行。自「八一三」後，國家面對存亡關頭，人民自當集中人力財力以求最後勝利，任何爭執，自須以和平合理之方法解決之，然在上海，則因環境特殊，爭執之案件反有增加，允自民二九以來，因物價飛漲益速，勞資衝突之案件，與日俱增，至爲嚴重。</p>
<p>以民二八年上海一五六件罷工及六二件糾紛案件觀之，罷工之起於經濟原因者，占總案件百分之七九·三：起於管理原因者僅百分之二〇·七；而管理原因中以僱傭及解僱爲最重要，佔百分之十七·二；較過去十年來之平均佔百分之二〇·七，稍有减少；在經濟原因案件中，以工資爲主，多至佔百分之五三·四；過去十年平均僅佔百分之二七·七；計增一倍除；待遇案則占百分之二五·九；過去十年之品均僅占百分之一·八八；暴增十四倍。至於民二八之糾紛案件，起於管理原因者計佔全額百分之三〇·五，起於經濟原因者有百分之六九·五，其中僱傭及解僱案件，由民十七以來平均之百分之六五·六，突降至民二八之百分之二〇·三，縮三倍餘，工資案件則由歷年平均之百分之一八·五升至民二八之百分之三〇·五，待遇案件則飛升至佔總案件白分之三九，超過歷年平均數多八倍餘，這是民二八上海勞資衝突的內容及其與過去平均數相比的大略</p>
<p>隨着資本主義的發達，勞資兩大階級間的對立日趨嚴重，在戰時，經濟金融的演變允易促使勞資衝突的滋生，但在今日我國，任何衝突均非現實所許，作者願略陳數語於後：</p>
<p>（一）我國眞在進行着長期而艱苦的民族解放戰爭，所謂長斯戰爭，即是經濟戰爭，在這種戰爭中，勞資雙方最基本的任務，即爲加强生產，所以任何　方爲求燦爛的前途，須先謀戰爭得勝利，而努力於安定經濟與加強生產，自為本身利益攸關，所以對於任何爭執，須以互諒互助之優良態度解決之，以求利潤分配之公平與企業管理之合理，達最高生產效能之目的</p>
<p>（二）自「八一三」以來，物資已供求失常，物價暴漲，各大小企業，無不大發其國難財，工人生活，艱難萬狀，單以上海而論，工人之名義工資雖有增加，然折合為真實工資，則自民二五之一百縮至民二九之五五·三三，資本家於暴利慶喜之餘，須知如許利潤中，實有一部份係剝削工人而得，因由於幣值之步跌，企業獲得超乎真實人工成本的工人勞務，不過在工作效能上講，這種行為顯為不智，因產品之質與量的减弱，必緊隨而來，故在利國利己利人鵠的下，讓工人於利潤中得合理部份是應該的</p>
<p>（三）企業管理之得失，對於工人工作心理極有影響，而工作心理與生產效能，更休戚相關，此早為效率專家所注意而證實，但我國企業家則鮮加重視，致無形中造成重大損失。此種心裡制改造，不外用各種物質與精神之方法，使各個工人徹底明瞭其在國民經濟與工廠製造上之重要，使各人深感全廠各工人之工資與其勞務等價，無庇袒欺凌之處，使每個工人保有最高度的建議權，取消不必要的干涉，以消除勞資間的隔閡，其他像消費合作社及工人俱樂部的設立，補習教育及免費醫療的推行，及儲儲保險等工人福利的辯理，亦屬必要，這種支出雖似多餘，但社會的安寧賴以保障，且生產表上的飛舁，自會彌補損失而有餘的。</p>
<h3>論現鈔貼水之不當  穆深思</h3>
<p>我國自新貨幣政策實施以來，法幣爲全國之唯一通貨。但在上海則有三種籌碼：（一）「現鈔」，（二）「劃頭」，（三）「匯劃」，名稱雖然屬不同，其爲法幣則一，除現鈔爲法幣之本體，亦即「現貨籌碼」外，所謂「劃頭」與「匯劃」，同是法幣之「流通籌碼」，惟前者可以當日兌現，而後者則須隔日兌現。是故往昔「匯劃」與「劃頭」之區別，僅爲一日之利息，至於「現鈔」與「劃頭」，不分軒輊，當無疑義。</p>
<p>迨八一三事變後，因安定金融辦法之規定，「匯劃」祇限於同業轉賬，不得兌現，於是「匯劃」遂成「封鎖籌碼」，皆在防止資金逃避，而「劃頭」則可照當兌現。質言之，「劃頭」可以兌換「現鈔」，而「匯劃」則不可。因此產生『匯劃」掉換「劉頭」必須貼水之現象，某一時期，匯劃貼水率竟高至每千元爲二百數十元。今則匯劃店水之恐慌已成尾聲，貼水率每千元僅爲數元而已。就原則論，同屬法幣，匯劃換則劃頭，須付貼水，於法目屬不合。惟因一則可以兌換現鈔，一則不可，復因現鈔在生活上不可或缺，願受貼水損失者，不乏其人，故此種貼水之發生，於理尙可曲解。今則以現鈔換取劃頭，亦須貼水，誠令人百思小得其解！夫劃頭之所以優於匯劃者，僅為劃頭可兌現鈔，而匯劃則不可，今將現鈔換成割頭，反須貼水，豈非咄咄怪事哉？</p>
<p>或謂中日事變之初，人心恐慌，競藏現鈔，以致現鈔供不應求，每有盡頭不易獲得現鈔之感，遂產生現鈔升水。是則現鈔因求過於供而產生升水，似亦可因供過於求而產生貼水是故目前現鈔貼水之發生，乃基於供求律，自有其成因。殊不知因理鈔缺乏，以致劃頭不易獲得現鈔而發生差額，此種差額，與其謂之爲「現鈔升水」，母寗謂之爲「劃頭貼水」，似較正確。然今日之「現鈔」與「劃頭」間所有差額，無論其稱爲「現鈔貼水」，抑或稱爲「劃頭升水」，均非所宜。蓋現鈔爲吾國法幣之木體，自非昔日銀幣時代之鈔票可比，至於劃頭乃是代表法幣流通之一種籌碼，其兌現仍以現鈔爲國象也。</p>
<p>基於上述，現鈔爲吾國一唯一通貨，無論其爲「升水」或「貼水」，均非通貨之正常狀態。如因通貨供求失衡，則金融業負有調劑天責，發行銀行固屬責無旁貸，其他一般銀行或錢莊，亦當通力合作，方可完成其安定社會金融之重大任務。例如市塲現鈔缺乏，銀行當設法供應，以適合社會需要；反之，市塲現鈔過剩，銀行亦當儘量吸收，供給劉頭，所謂緊縮通貨是也。今滬地發生現鈔貼水，屈指一月有餘，在四月初旬，現鈔掉換劃頭貼水，曾高至每萬爲三十餘元，迄今尙在十元左右按銀錢業中體認時艱，應付得宜者，固屬多數。但亦不乏行莊，認識不足，藉口現鈔發生貼水，對於存戶存人現鈔，或則橫加限制，或則拒絕收受，甚至對於同業前來交換之存戶支票，竟有以「祇辦現鈔」一語藉爲退票理由者。此端一開，則凡爲劃頭之支票，均有遭遇退票之危險，其阻礙票據之流通，而預響社會金融者，至重且鉅。進而言之，坐令一般專事剝削之輩，居中漁種，而行莊自身反遭社會之唾駡；其愚蠢與荒謬，寗有逾於此者？</p>
<p>試思工商業日常營業上所收受之現鈔，自以解存銀行錢莊為其唯一合理之出路，若銀力面不予儘量收受，則若輩將何以處置其現鈔之收入？此其一。</p>
<p>同業間利用交換方式，本可避免現鈔收解之危險，即不在同一變換範圍之銀行，例如洋商銀行向華商銀行收票，亦以「交換支票」付之，藉資鄭重而免危險，今旣發生之解現鈔象，則在此時此地，彼此解現收現，危險更甚，此其二。</p>
<p>上述兩端，均屬膚淺之見，金融界不乏明哲之士，定能早檢及此。至於行爲之失檢行莊，究佔少數。竊願吾整個金融業，在銀行銀行領導之下，有則改之，無則加勉，藉謀現鈔貼水之早日消滅，則幸甚矣。或謂拒收現鈔及以「祇解現鈔」作爲退票理由，全因現鈔貼水而產生。殊不知此乃互爲因果，而欲謀現鈔貼水之消滅，必先山銀　美儘量收受現鈔，並可照常抵用劃頭，始克有濟。否則，現鈔貼水之存在與高漲是在意中，旣爲工農業前途累，亦非金融界目身之福也。　三十，五，九，於中法銀行</p>
<h3>論今日之勞工問題（上）  胡錫山</h3>
<p>求作戰力之加强，加增生產實爲當前急務；吾人皆知勞動力爲生產要素之一，允其在今日之吾國經濟機構下，因各地不能充份獲得機械之使用，人力允覺重要。往昔一般的資本主，均認機器爲生產之惟一要件，對勞工則忽視之，此實爲絕大之錯誤。蓋勞工問題不先予良好之處置。則工業何能振興？在勞工問題中，則工資，技術之訓練，勞資協調等，皆屬重要之事項，際此戰時，物資需要劇增，欲加增生產以適應此當前之需要，則如何避免勞資糾紛？改善勞工生活？提高工作之効率？皆爲値得吾人研究之問題，本文即予今日勞工方面之切實問題，作簡略之檢討。</p>
<p>勞資關係之改善</p>
<p>勞資間最難置處之問題，爲如何求勞資雙方能合作，以解除很此間的一切糾紛？在社會主義國家，勞資不分其界限，故無所謂勞資糾紛。然在一般情形之下，勞資雙方，往往站於相對的地位；勞方總是希望資方對其待遇能改善，而資方則爲其曰身之利，絕不願澈底的來滿足勞方的慾望。原則上，這是個彼此的利害關系。根本的解決，當使勞資間能協調。怎樣協調？這是廣而雜的重要問題；資方首富瞭解勞方，儘可能的給以機會與勞工，以鼓勵其合作的精神。在任何規模的工業組織中，管理者與工人，應取一貫的聯絡。資方當隨時明悉勞方於今日情况下之生活，以及其一般的好惡與思想；同時隨時使勞方知悉廠方今日的處境，以及戰時生產的重要，以加强勞方的工作力量；其决工業之經營者，亦應顧及今召國家之處境，絕不能對工人有所剝削之金圖；蓋工人受資本主的剝削，生活困苦，工人視工作爲苦事，對工廠毫無美好情感，於是工人與工頭易起仇恨，工人不能專心工作，工作効率减低，虱潮激起，皆咸必然現象。故使勞資關係之改善，實為今日提高生產水準，加強生產數量所首要的條件。</p>
<p>強制調解勞資糾紛</p>
<p>勞資間發生爭議，在任何時期中是難免的。勞方不滿於資方後，勞方的運動，則不外是怠工與罷工。怠工者，工廠未停工，工人仍進廠工作，但工人並不按廠方的目的而進行工作。顯見的現象，便是故意延慢工作，以及搗相工場物件；此種情形雖不十分嚴重，但產品個劇減以及工廠之受損，極是重大。罷工則整個工廠的工作完全停工，影響所及，不特是該產業之生產中止，且足使與該產業具有相關性之產業，亦將負連帶之損害；此極現象，至爲嚴重；吾國各地之各種工業，其生產機能大部已爲戰爭所毀損；故現今各類不同之生產品，頗多集中於少數的工業中；設有某項急需之物品，今因甲工業之罷工而中止生產，致累及與該還有關之乙工業，因不能獲得製造之原料，而同樣中止共生產。擴大言之；　工業單位之中止生產，足使若干相關之工業同時停頓。這種事態，對於時之工業生產，勢必發生莫大之阻礙，為絕對防止勞資糾紛起見，在事先當盡力避免其衝突的發生，在事後當施行强制的手段以調解之。</p>
<p>爲求勞資糾紛能獲公正及迅速之解決，可組設戰時或特種勞資糾紛仲裁委員會，由地方政府及勞資代表會同組織之，委員會對於勞資糾紛，當以最近迅速之方式解決之，絕勿使延長日期，首先可進行勸吿，目解說本產業在目前之重要性，使之和解而即行恢復生產：有重要的之產業，於勞方不服仲裁及資方確寶不能接受其要求時，則可由政府輔助資方處理之，設於資方不服仲裁時，則政府爲顧及該產業之生產起見，可直接派員代爲接管該產業，並代爲墊支生產上之一切製造費用，並接受勞方合理部份之要求，在生產進行中，勞資雙方仍可派舉代表，扣互協議；政府後雙方之糾紛解決後，仍可卸轉其管理之責任，而由原來之資主經營之。</p>

<p>燃料問題　不知何時亦能　如米價之平落</p>
<p>自工部局公賣米實行、米價已收平準之效、獨煤昂貴如故、四百數十元一噸白煤、十六元一担煤球、使大多數人有米難炊、其困難雖無米之甚、而亦予生活上以絕大威脅、查煤價之漲、據傳亦爲水脚之故、蓋此决戰事發財無止境者祗有航業、不說洋商擁有巨量之船隻、盈餘之鉅、或將奴其數層樓之高、即有三四輪乃至一二輪、在此三年中、所賺亦在數十百萬元不等、古語有日進斗金之說、爲今航商、豈止斗金、將以石計、而且其他之貨物囤積居奇、如人所易曉、獨航商坐收大利、不爲世人所注目、不爲社會所唾駡、因之向日經營航業之華商、亦不乏後悔、早知今日坐看他人發橫財、何不當時稍留二船、不要盡行駛出、輒厭世事處置不公允、往往因人而施、凡人所難爲的事、祇耍有勢力的人均可去幹、此亦不僅上海一地爲然、假如對於航業操縱把持、得有解決辦法、不要說米、即煤價亦易半落、</p>

<p>工部局運銷洋米，已收宏效。尙望進一步取締囤積，以絕亂萌。何者是囤積居奇？最近國府頒佈的「非常時期違反糧食管理治罪暫行條例」中，有如决規定：</p>
<p>（一）非經營商業之人或非經營糧食業之商人，購囤糧食營利者。</p>

<p>（五）未經核准，民戶存糧，不得超過二個月以上需要量，且不得繼續購進而超過其二個月之需要量；吾則即予沒收（該法第六條）</p>
<p>希望兩租界當局，參酌本地情形，也規定一個囤積居奇的定義，以便市民校舉。</p>

<h3>生活素</h3>
<p>— 舜琴</p>
<p>生活素或稱維他命，為人們在生活上所必需的。分成當生活素缺少的時候，生活上就會發生特殊的障碍而致疾病。據今日已經發明而能確實證明的，有下列五種，茲略論其各種生活素的存在與功用，以吿讀者諸君：</p>
<p>甲種生活素，大部含於動植物的油肪或脂肪中。牛酪，牛油，肝油，羊油，椰子油，棉花子油，花生油等，均含有之。惟豬油中則全缺，蛋類與榖類也微含少量。缺乏甲種生活素者，便要發生眼結合膜乾燥症，厲害些的甚至眼瞎。又這種生活素，和身體發育也有關係；故缺乏此甲種生活素者，應多食卵黃和肝臟，如無力購動植物脂肪者，則用新鮮的菜羹，因靑菜中，亦含有少量的甲種生活素。</p>
<p>乙種生活素，大部含於五榖的外皮及榖皮內，酵母內含量極富，其他如扁豆，卵黃，豌豆，牛肉，馬鈴薯中亦含有少量。缺乏乙種生活素者，便要患脚氣病，若不速治，一旦腫至胞腹，有危害生命的可能。發現此病與榖類的關係者為荷蘭醫生哀克門氏。哀氏以東印度帬島監獄中的犯人作試騐，結論調食粗米者絕少患脚氣病，食白米者極易患脚氣病。因此我們所食的米，不可舂臼過白，蓋米的外層，含有抗此病的物質；同時宜多食植物的葉部及豆類。乙種生活素，又稱抗脚氣病素。</p>
<p>丙種生活素，大部含於新鮮的果實與蔬菜中。檸檬，柑橘，甘籃，番茄，蕪菁，牛奶等含量最富。缺乏丙種生活素者，就要發生壞血病，病狀為腸胃生瘡，皮下流血，骨節鬆脆，牙根搖動，患此病而致死的亦為數不鮮；通常以水手為最多，因為戰時和航海的船上，沒有新鮮的食料，致面黃飢瘦萎靡不振，極易有壞血病的發生。丙種生活素，又稱抗血疽病素。</p>
<p>丁種生活素，兼稱搞軟骨病素，缺乏此種生活素者，必害軟骨病，兒童到了四五歲甚至於七八歲的時候，不授以充量的含丁種生活素食品，又不多見日光，必患此病。在第一次歐戰結束後，德國人民生活窮苦，深居地窟，終年不見天日，兒童患軟骨病者甚衆，後將病者赤露日光下，遂漸愈。患此病者，宜多食魚肝油，牛乳，但日光中有天然的丁種生活素，而靑菜中，亦含有少量的丁種生活素。</p>
<p>戊種生活素，大部含於動物肌肉和小麥胚，玉蜀黍和豌豆等裏面，缺乏戊種生活素，動物便會失掉生育機能。</p>
<h3>婦女裝飾的標準</h3>
<p>— 許孝格</p>
<p>人類是富於感情的，具有强固的愛美心，誰不願修飾得自己漂亮好看呢！這種愛美的心理，婦女們尤其顯著和强固，所以它們即使每日生活非常困苦，省吃節用也得去裝飾自己的美，的確，婦女們的裝飾是極應該的，因為人生中有了美才能使生活有味，使人變美的方法就在裝飾，婦女們裝飾好了，簡直就是一朶美麗的鮮花，夫婦間或愛人間的愛情亦因此愈加深固起來，這不是人生之幸福嗎？現在把裝飾必須合乎的幾條原則列下，希望太太和小姐們參考：</p>
<p>（一）適合衛生：普通有一般婦女們只顧求美，而把身體的衛生忽略了，例如束胸　腰和穿高跟鞋，便是極不衛生的裝飾，因為束胸　腰，一則妨碍肺部的呼吸，再則阻止腸胃的水貨，影響身體的健康實在是很大的，在日常又是感到多麼不舒服呢！穿高跟鞋可以影響足的發展，與我國的　足有相同的害處，動作行路十分不便，與囚犯所帶在脚上的脚鐐有何區別？使好好的自由人變成不自由的囚犯，實在可嘆；所以裝飾只顧了美觀而使身體吃苦，那就太不値得了。</p>
<p>（二）勿過奢華：我們裝飾要看家族經濟狀况，餓着肚子去講究裝飾，當然也是很不必的事，可是也不要過於不裝飾，經濟充裕的家族，對於裝飾的費用可以多化一點，但亦不可過於奢華，經濟不充裕的家族，對於裝飾的費用要盡力節儉，因為尚有一切比裝飾要緊的事情須辦，　貧的婦女們不可只顧了裝飾而忘却了這一點。</p>
<p>（三）要藝術化：藝術的美，才是眞正的美，旣不俗又秀雅，使人鑑賞後心中起快感；文明程度愈高的人，他們婦女的裝飾就愈藝術化，所以交通便利的　埠，就比僻陋阻塞的鄉間裝飾得藝術化；文明民族就比野蠻民族裝飾得藝術化，試看電影裏野蠻民族婦女的裝飾多麼難看呢！裝飾品是那麼笨重和奇異，我們文明人的裝飾，須如一首古雅的詩歌，輕描淡寫，不要弄得太鮮艷了，因為太鮮艷就過俗而無藝術價値了。所以穿衣服要穿素雅的料子，理髮要短和不燙為佳，粉要以薄唇塗之，巾脂要輕輕點之，總之，只要合乎藝術的美可以任意去裝飾，但不可使之過於奇怪就行。</p>
<h3>防癆聾中的居住</h3>
<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>近來在提倡着防癆運動，的確有益於社會大衆非淺，因此想起各人在自己的家庭內，也該注意一下，以使增强防癆的效果，茲將筆者所想到的幾點，寫在下面，或可稍供參考吧？</p>
<p>（一）勤洗痰盂：不論那一家住戶，總備有着幾隻痰盂，可是大都懶於洗滌，往往有些人家一天只洗一次，甚之數天洗一次的。更有把痰盂當作垃圾桶似的，什麼齷齪的東西像菓皮榖…等，都貪便當的向痰盂裏一丟，這是多麼的有害衛生；加以今後蒼蠅等將產生，而痰盂裏正是它們繁殖的地方，所以勤洗痰盂，其得益必很大。</p>
<p>（二）勤倒垃圾：室內掃下的垃圾，應隨時取出倒掉，否則一陣風來，仍會吹得滿地。我們常可見到有些人家掃起地來，必把垃圾掃到門角裏去，要等到積得多了才肯取出倒去。豈知日積月累，變成了一切毒物的產生地，所以垃圾應該勤倒。</p>
<p>（三）食器分開：我國人的家庭，關於茶杯，飯碗，筷，匙等食器，都是並不每人分開的，道很不好。其實分開是輕而易舉的事，祗須將各人的用器上寫上各人的名字，就可識別，好在並不麻煩，大家倒可推行一下的；何况這又是合於衛生的呢？</p>
<p>（四）小病速治：一個普通的家庭，倘有一個小孩患有咳嗽，做家長的總不肯馬上請醫診治，認有是小傷風無關緊要，豈知這是何等的危險呀！所以有病總以先着急為宜，至於能常向醫院去騐身體，當然更好了。</p>
<p>總之。居室內應常加洗掃，務使常常保持着清潔，那麼必可防絕癆菌的侵入，至於食的應注意衛生，也是要緊的。</p>
<h3>全球最精緻的火車</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>英國政府為供該國王室旅行之用，備有火車一輛，最近因有原有的一輛年代已久，又有一輛新的完成，可以稱謂「全球最精緻的火車」。現在，先來作一番介紹。</p>
<p>談起這輛　火車，落成的日期已在戰事發生以後。全部工程由倫敦及蘇格蘭各地的鐵路專家擔任，全車共有三節，其分配很平均，一節歸國王，一節歸王后；另一節歸依麗　伯及瑪格蘭兩公主。國王之一節有睡室，有浴室，而讀書室一間佈置尤精，各室的天花板則全漆乳白色。王后之一節處處以適合女性居住為主。此二節各長六十五呎。公主之一節最簡單，除睡室外，祗休息室一間。</p>
<p>此車有幾特點値得一提：一般人總有這個觀念，一輛供王室專用的火車，應該有重重的軍事防備保護，而此車適得其反。第二點是有冷熱設備；車內的溫度不受車外氣候的影響。第三點是此車如果在某站停下的時候，可以向全世界任何各地通電話。最後一點車內的全部　具完全鍍銀。</p>
<p>今王喬治第六，平日素喜偕向王后出外旅行，自歐戰起後，雖出入於鐵鳥炸彈之下，此好仍不稍減。則「全球最精緻的火車」亦將隨王室的足跡，來去於英倫三島之途上！</p>
<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>鰣魚已上市好多天了；可是每兩貴到五六角，吃這麼小的一段，就非二三元不辦，所以筆者雖很愛吃鰣魚，食指大動，而還是不敢問津，連菜單中也不敢配入。但是這樣美味的時鮮貨，菜單中豈可沒有它的地位，所以本星期六就給它漏一漏臉，讓經濟力寬裕的人們去嘗新吧。鰣魚的煮法，不外淸蒸和紅燒兩種；而以淸蒸為腴美，紅燒似乎差一些。不過淸蒸最好還要加些火腿片，並用綱油包裹，所費更在紅燒之上，還是讓吃的人自己去打算吧。</p>
<p>星期一　菉豆芽肉絲　糖醋溜黃魚　菠菜燒豆腐　葱花蘿蔔絲</p>
<p>星期二　番茄牛肉湯　銀絲炒雞蛋　雪菜炒蠶豆　香椿拌豆腐</p>
<p>星期三　乾菜紅燒肉　肉餅燉　　　素油豆腐湯　淸炒金花菜</p>
<p>星期四　洋葱牛肉絲　糖醋煎帶魚　葱花蠶豆沙　麻將拌蓬蒿</p>
<p>星期五　肉末燒豆腐　高郵　鴨蛋　紅燒素十景　雪菜黃豆芽</p>

<h3>（九九）黃魚餃子</h3>
<p>— 金戔擬稿</p>
<p>預備…黃魚　麵粉　香菌　味精　　　葱　辣醬油或醋</p>
<p>製法…生黃魚洗凈後，去頭尾及骨梗等，將香菌先泡軟去梗，再與魚肉併攏一同刴爛，和入料酒，葱花，　末及適量之味精，鹽等拌之，一面再將麵粉用水拌勻揉熟，摘成小塊，復滾成皮子，把黃魚肉等嵌入作饀，揑成荷包形，然後一一平鋪於蒸籠上蒸熟，以醋或辣醬油蘸食，鮮美無比。</p>
<h3>（一百）炸蝦包</h3>
<p>— 金戔擬稿</p>

<h3>米是怎樣囤成功的？</h3>
<p>— 沉思</p>
<p>斗室中。</p>
<p>王總理伸手向烟盒裏取出「亨牌」來，立刻，躺在對面沙發裏的副理李少梅，站起來趕前一步，劃上火柴，送到王總理的面前去，王總經理吸着吸着：</p>
<p>「不錯，少梅，你的話很有見地，要是日美眞的交起手來，西貢方面的船舶……」</p>
<p>李副理滿面得意地接下他老師的話，謙虛地說：「那也不是我獨具慧眼，先生也一定早已看到的，到那時候的米價，可以保定……所以，趁……」</p>
<p>「現在我們的存貨是不是還有三萬包？」</p>
<p>李副理思索了一下，回答說：</p>
<p>「唔，三萬包左右。」</p>
<p>王總理把手掌托住了下巴，沉思了片刻，說：</p>
<p>「續定那麼一萬包，其實够上海幾小時吃食呢？絕不能算多！但是，銀根方面……我想，或者先叫他們去挑一挑，揀去年上半年的底貨先出一批籠……。哦，不，不出籠也好，到飢不擇食的時候，誰再顧慮到陳腐不陳腐呢？」</p>
<p>「對，對！」李副理輕輕地搥着手掌，「先生的話一些也不錯，我們假使把陳腐的出籠，再去定新的，那不是等於沒有定麽？」</p>
<p>「但是，銀—根—方面。」王總經理旋轉着威嚴十足的眼珠，把他的話語拖得老長。的確道是個難題，沒有錢是不能囤貨的，即使明知道百物再要漲。因此，王總理也感到稍稍棘手，他遲疑地繼續着說：「××莊上已經透支了五十萬，它們底子小，祗有七十萬資本，似乎不好意思再開口。至於××銀行抵押過一萬包給它們，也……的雖還有十多家往來，差不多額子戶用足，而且也並不知己：要末×××銀行，底子大，而且我曾經放過交情給它們跑街，讓給他一千包米過，或者……」</p>
<p>王總經理站了起來，兩手在肚子上輕輕地拍着，踱近寫字檯，提起話筒，但叉放了下來，說：</p>
<p>「少梅，你替我代打吧，×××，叫姓兪的跑街聽電話，問他要五十萬頭寸。」</p>
<p>李副理接通了電話，笑臉開了。一會，他掩住聽筒，輕輕地說：</p>
<p>「先生，他已一口答應，現在他們銀根爛着苦於沒處放，他還說，像我們這樣賺錢的米行，不要說六十萬，就是一百六十萬也肯放。」</p>
<p>「一百六十萬？少梅！」王總經理搶前）步，激動得聲音有些異樣，「吿訴他，要是眞的，那就答應吃他一百六十萬，三個月，利息不過最多一分。」</p>
<p>李副理交涉了一陣，滿意地掛下聽筒，說：</p>
<p>「他完全在他經理面前通過了。先生，你的意思是預備定一萬五千包？」</p>
<p>王總經理搖搖頭！</p>
<p>「不，想定二萬包，看情形也可能定二萬包，少梅，你再打××壯看，他們也挪五十萬怎樣？」</p>
<p>電話接通了，不過有些疙瘩，李副理掩住聽筒輕輕地說</p>
<p>「他們多三十萬頭寸，已經預備做煤屑押款的，要是先生要，他們回絕那邊。」</p>
<p>「答應他們。」</p>
<p>「不是還少廿萬嗎？」</p>
<p>「少梅，你答應他們再說，利息與限和×××一樣。」</p>
<p>李副理掛斷了電話：</p>
<p>「先生，還有廿萬？」</p>
<p>王總經理微笑地回答：</p>
<p>「三姨太有筆存款任××，廿五萬，劃出來也讓她得得手高興高興。」</p>
<p>王總經理抑止不住地哈哈笑了，李副理也高興得陪着哈哈大笑。</p>

<h3>媽媽教孩子的故事</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>在小菜塲附近一條狹弄口坐着一個精利萎靡蓬頭垢面的老婦人。一個大的十二三歲骨瘦如柴赤着膊的孩子倚在她的懷裏。</p>
<p>「媽媽！……我……餓……得很……呀」！帶着哭的語調斷斷續續地。但是他的媽媽好像沒有聽見似的，祇是呆望着過路的行人。</p>
<p>隔了一刻。忽然他的媽媽用着輕微的聲音對他說：</p>
<p>「那邊一個『小脚』女人的籃子裏，有幾個麵包，你去搶……」這孩子聽了，揉着眼，立刻站起身來，連跑連跳的向他媽媽所指的方向走去。當他走近那扭着「小脚」的婦人，就躡着足，先向籃裏看了一眼，「喔唷！叫個麵包」。他默默地說着，口角上流下幾點唾沫，籃裏共他的東西他也無心去注意，他祇是用那閃電似的動作，從籃子裏搶了二個麵包就逃。</p>
<p>他本想把籃裏的四個麵包一個腦兒搶了，但他膽小，所以祇搶了兩個。</p>
<p>「啊呀！……殺千刀！……兩只麵包……被他……搶去了」。從那扭着「小脚」的婦人嘴裹驚嚇地發出；立刻許多行人的眼光被吸到了她的身上，可是沒有一個人替他追那搶麵包的孩千，有的還露着笑容像看了滑精喜劇一般。</p>
<p>他「邊逃」邊把一個麵包塞的他的嘴裹，一口口地吃着餘下的一個麵包，還要帶給他已飢餓了好久的媽媽吃呢！</p>
<h3>上薦頭店</h3>
<p>— 竺迅</p>
<p>隔夜受了母親的吩咐，天一亮祇得到薦頭店裏找娘姨了。</p>
<p>懷着忐忑不安的情緒，走進一間滿坐着「姑娘」和「婦人」的店內，有的正在嚼大餅，有的在閒談，看見我走進，數十條目光便掃射在我的身上。</p>
<p>「找娘姨嗎！」一個大腹便便的老闆娘過來招待着。是的，我來叫一個娘姨！」</p>
<p>「聽你揀罷！老的呢？還是年靑的？」</p>
<p>在凳上坐着的有長有短，有瘦有肥！有龍鍾老態的小脚的，亦有雅善修飾的年靑的！我督了一眼：「我家祇有二個人，一母一子。要會買買小菜，洗洗衣服，粗做的！」</p>
<p>「聽見了沒有？啥人願意去？」老闆娘很悄皮說。</p>
<p>「人倒少的，工錢怎樣？</p>
<p>「這種人家諒來沒有外快的！賺死工錢我是隨便也不去的！」</p>
<p>「阿姐！你去試試看，沒有小孩，不洗尿布，人又少，你倒很配。」</p>
<p>在這失業羣中一度決議後，終於推出一個四十歲左右的人，她帶笑似的，向我說：我去試試看，好哦！」</p>
<p>我就滿意地答應了她的要求，她挾了小包裹跟我回家。</p>
<p>剛到家裏，一眼見我這破舊的臥室，滿塵的書桌；她好似受了大寃屈似的，沒有做事，一下子就跑了。</p>

<p>「對不起，我先走一步！」就向那個內科醫生說。</p>

<p>「別取笑」！秃子已經快走出門去了。「當心臉上吃刀子」！內科醫生從籐椅上站起來，很幽默地說。</p>
<p>屋子裏正充漫着笑聲的時候，方才去的那個姓李的看護又奔回來了，臉上也透着很興奮的笑容。</p>

<p>「是一個男人啊！」内科醫生茫無頭緒地說。在他想來，男人害病的時候，最歡喜看見的總是某一個女人；換了女人書病，也必然是這樣。而且幾年來他當醫生的經騐，似乎也很可證實他這個理想，所以他一聽那看護的話，便覺得萬分詫異起來。</p>
<p>顏大夫却不說什麼，祗把那紙片接了過去。</p>
<p>「趙玉崑，日租界旭街老丹鳳茶園轉」。他輕輕地這樣念着。一秃子的話不錯，看來眞不像是個上流人。好！你上去吧！吿訴他我們立刻打發人去找，敎他自己先安心休養，過一會我們好歹總有回音給他。」這些話皆是專對那個看護說的。</p>
<p>不等那看護退出去，外面走廊下裝的一具電鈴，已給顏大夫掀得震天價的響了。（一〇九）</p>

<h3>U.S. President Calls on People to Rise Up and Resist the Axis Economic Encirclement to Safeguard Democracy and Enhance Freedom; New York Grandly Celebrates "Citizenship Day" Yesterday</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt declared yesterday evening that dictatorial countries have already severely economically encircled the United States. The President also called on all Americans to rise up and fight to resist Germany and its allies' attempt to enslave the world economically. The President spoke at a foreign trade conference, from May 18th to May 24th, being Foreign Trade Week. The President said that the United States is rapidly moving into the world's most serious crisis. He said that aggressors are threatening the national, social, spiritual, and economic institutions of the United States. The victory of totalitarian countries will enslave the world economically. Thereafter, international trade "will be monopolized by a few countries that openly declare their conquest of the world." The President also said, "If we do not prepare now to defend the principles we rely on, then there is no point in talking about future international trade." He also said, "This defense, every American should immediately take as their own responsibility and make the greatest effort. At present and after the crisis has passed, the United States should continue its leadership position to implement and promote a free economy policy. If the United States wants to fulfill its responsibility to rebuild the world economy, there is no other way than to take a leadership position. At present, the world's economic problems are suffering from destructive restrictions, most of which are caused by aggression." (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt made a statement regarding National Trade Week, saying that the United States must safeguard democracy and continue to be a leader in promoting freedom and economic politics. Only in this way can the United States fulfill its responsibility to rebuild the world economy from the chaos caused by destructive trade restrictions. "We all know that we are now facing a truly tense global crisis. What is endangered by the aggression of totalitarian countries is not only our foreign trade and the prosperity of our national industries, but also the social and spiritual structure of our people's democratic life." (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington - Today is America's "I Am An American Citizen" Day, and three million people will be welcomed as American citizens. Among these three million people are young people who have reached the age of 21 and foreigners who obtained American citizenship last year. Government leaders will also take this opportunity to issue statements regarding American policy. The largest gathering will be held in New York, where New York Mayor LaGuardia, Vice President Wallace, Attorney General Jackson, Interior Secretary Ickes, and Congressman Rayburn will all speak to the audience. Production Management Bureau official Knudson will preside over the ceremony in Chicago, and the 1936 Republican presidential candidate Landon will address the nation by radio in an address delivered in Muncie, Indiana. In Hollywood, Edward Arnold, Alan Hale, Jackie Cooper, and Alexander will all participate in the ceremony held in Hollywood. In addition, many other towns will also hold celebrations. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Dagong Bao newspaper commented today, predicting that Britain and the Soviet Union will be the fifteenth and sixteenth countries to be conquered by Germany. The newspaper also said that Germany has accumulated sufficient strength to render the Monroe Doctrine ineffective, and as a result, Germany will economically conquer the United States. The article was written by Professor Sha Xucun (transliteration) of the National Central University. Professor Sha stated that the German-Soviet border is 1,000 miles long, and the Soviet Union has no possible defense, so the Soviet Union is very vulnerable to aggression. The article also discussed Germany's current economic strength, saying that since Germany has annexed fourteen countries and absorbed their natural resources, Germany's economic strength is at least equal to that of the United States. It also said that Germany, with its strongest organization and unparalleled technical capabilities, will soon become the world's number one fortress, and from this fortress will emerge a new Germany that will conquer the world. Germany today has sufficient food, munitions, and materials to expand its naval, land, and air forces. To say that Germany's position is the same as in 1918 is a foolish argument. It must be known that Germany's current power to wage a sustained war is far greater than in the last World War. It also claims that Germany already has</p>
<h3>Diplomats of Various Countries Stationed in the Soviet Union Prohibited from Free Travel</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet Union's 1936 foreign travel regulations, which stipulate that foreigners wishing to travel in the Soviet Union must first obtain permission from the relevant authorities and have their itinerary noted on their passports before they can pass, now also apply to diplomats stationed in Moscow from various countries. The Soviet authorities have now issued circulars stating that areas such as the Kola Peninsula, Murmansk, Leningrad, the Karelian Isthmus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, western Belarus, western Ukraine, Kyiv, Moldova, certain ports on the Black Sea, Crimea, the Baku oil fields, and other areas of Siberia are prohibited areas for foreigners to travel. (Haitong News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>Various methods to overthrow Britain, conquer the Soviet Union, and make Germany the world's number one safe country. The article concluded by saying that the Soviet Union will gradually become a victim of Hitler's actions, because the Soviet Union's two western gateways, namely the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea, are under German control. The article also pointed out that the new Soviet-German border is easy to attack and difficult to defend. Although the Soviet Union obtained a piece of Polish territory in 1929, it may soon become Poland's second. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<h3>Rumor That Japan Will Provide Warships for the German Navy to Deploy; Specializing in Piracy in the Pacific; Large Batch of American Aircraft Arrives in New Zealand</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Chinese Army's official newspaper stated today that Germany and Japan have negotiated a secret new agreement, under which Japan will provide Germany with seventy warships to be used as Nazi pirate ships in the Pacific. The newspaper said that these seventy warships will be commanded by Japanese captains and be under the command of the German Navy Department in Berlin. These pirate ships will only be used in the Pacific region. (United Press, 18th)</p>

<h3>Qingdao Mercenary Police Revolt and Defect</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Chinese official newspaper announced today that the Qingdao Gao Xiu's mercenary police force recently revolted successfully. Before defecting to the Chinese guerrillas, they destroyed the Japanese military depot and barracks at Niugugou (transliteration), less than two miles from Qingdao, and destroyed the salt revenue bureau at Yindao (transliteration), three miles from Qingdao. Gao's force brought 136 rifles, 48 short guns, and 11,500 rounds of ammunition. This defection force has now been incorporated into the regular army. (United Press, 18th)</p>

<h3>China Motor Company Self-Manufactures Diesel Truck Parts</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Since the China Motor Manufacturing Company established a loan with the German Auto Union-Wolf Company several years ago, it has intensified its efforts in automobile manufacturing and has received blueprints and all technical assistance from the Wolf Company. The company is now manufacturing Daimler-Benz type diesel trucks with a load capacity of two tons in large quantities. The first one has been completed and is currently speeding back and forth on the roads of Chongqing. Many of these types of trucks were previously shipped from Germany and run on vegetable oil. Now, the China Motor Company can also manufacture the parts for the truck itself. In other words, 50% of the parts on the newly completed diesel truck are manufactured by the company itself. It is said that the company will soon be able to manufacture all the parts needed for the car. (18th)</p>
<h3>"China Week" Begins Across the United States Yesterday; More Than Two Hundred Mayors Declare and Call on the American People to Do Their Best to Help China</h3>
<p>Washington - The United States officially began "China Week" today. Governors of ten states and mayors of 200 major cities will issue declarations, calling on the American people to support the United China Relief Association's fundraising of five million yuan to relieve China and seek China's economic recovery. Next week's main activities will be centered in New York, where the city will raise 1.7 million yuan. During this week, women's circles, vocational circles, cultural circles, and children will all hold special programs. Participants will include actress Lily Pons, famous Chinese writer Lin Yutang, famous American female writer Pearl S. Buck, and newspaper columnist Ms. Thompson. New York State Governor Lehman, in an official statement, called on the American people, regardless of profession, race, belief, and political opinion, to do their best to give aid and encouragement to the only remaining democracy in Asia. Lehman said that China is the border of the democracies of the Pacific. "If the freedom and independence of China's 400 million people are destroyed and they become slaves to the German, Italian, and Japanese military machine, then there will be terrible consequences for the United States economically and politically." Lehman also said that it is necessary to increase the hope and belief of these millions of democratic people so that China can remain the cornerstone of establishing a just and democratic civilization.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Luoyang; Several Fires Break Out</h3>
<p>Luoyang - Today, hundreds of Japanese light bomber aircraft bombed this city in shifts with a large number of destructive bombs and incendiary bombs. In the four years of the Sino-Japanese War, this city has been bombed hundreds of times, but this time was the most serious. Bombers attacked in formations, at least five times, and in between the main attacks, there were individual aircraft flying around the city. The air raid alarm lasted twelve hours, the longest alarm in this battle. Bombs were scattered throughout the city, and the city's commercial district and western suburbs were heavily bombed. The Italian Catholic Church has been bombed twice in a week, with a total of two bombs. Casualties were not important, because the population has recently been evacuated, and there are excellent air raid shelters densely distributed in the alluvial soil. Fires broke out in several areas, but were quickly extinguished. Because the houses in the city were built of mud bricks and tiles, the fire could not spread. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Area of Wheat Planting in Various Provinces Greatly Increased</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Since the outbreak of the war, the area of cultivated land for wheat, barley, and other crops in the fifteen provinces in the rear has increased year by year. In the 30th year of the Republic, it showed a sharp increase, which is a good phenomenon during the war. According to statistics from the Agricultural Intelligence Report of the Central Agricultural Research Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the wheat area in the fifteen provinces in the rear this year reached 130 million mu, an increase of 9.2 million mu compared with the 29th year of the Republic. The barley area reached 52 million mu, an increase of 1.7 million mu. The area of bean crops also increased by 2 million mu, for a total increase of 15 million mu. Among them, Sichuan Province's wheat area increased by more than 2.6 million mu, barley increased by 600,000 mu, and bean crops increased by 200,000 mu, for a total increase of more than 4 million mu. Since the beginning of spring, the climate in Sichuan Province has been mild, with favorable weather conditions, and there have been good harvests in various places. Good news has also been frequently reported from other provinces, with an estimated increase in food production of 15 million dan in various provinces. It is said that the increase in area is mainly due to farmers' automatic increase in production due to high grain prices, and the government's promotion of winter cultivation also has a significant relationship. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry formulated measures to promote winter cultivation last winter, ordering the Central Agricultural Institute to send personnel to assist various provinces in implementation. Thanks to the efforts of various provinces in implementing these measures, providing seeds to farmers, lending funds, opening up more arable land, providing technical guidance, and encouraging the people to assist in cultivation, the above results have been achieved. This year, the central government has allocated a large sum of money, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has established a Food Production Committee to expand the work of increasing food production. In the future, the results should be even greater. (18th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The New Crisis in the Near East</h3>
<p>Following Vichy's renewed submission to Germany, the war in the Near East has become increasingly extensive and complex. The British have taken hostile action against Syria for providing military convenience to Germany, and the British air force in Iraq has also begun to engage with the newly arrived German aircraft. In addition, Iraqi sources claim that Iraqi troops have crossed the outer border and the Diyala River, and there are reports that Palestine has been invaded. Compared with the German announcement on the 13th that the Red Sea is a war zone, it can be seen that Hitler is meticulously trying to compete with Britain in the Near East, and the threat faced by Britain is now more serious than before.</p>
<p>Reviewing the development of this situation, one cannot help but regret that Britain failed to accurately grasp the initiative and time factor. The outbreak of the war in Iraq was originally a preemptive move by the British army. Although Gailani appealed to Germany at the beginning of the war, the Nazis were unable to quickly come to his aid. If it were not for the Vichy authorities' "cooperation" with Germany, they would probably still be looking for a way to assist Iraq. During those two weeks, it is believed that the British army in the Near East did have the strength and possibility to quell the upheaval in Mesopotamia. However, in reality, apart from holding on to one or two strongholds, there was no progress. This stalemate continued until the completion of the German-French negotiations. Regardless of whether this was due to other difficulties or a mistaken belief that the Iraqi authorities could easily be cornered and subdued, strategically they had already fallen behind. The British have realized that destroying the Mosul oil fields completely is better than allowing the Nazis to seize them peacefully. Why did they sit back and watch the passage of time? Even if the British army still has full confidence in controlling the overall situation in the Near East, at least dealing with this complex and chaotic situation at present will be far more difficult than before.</p>
<p>Britain's management of the Near East, starting with Lawrence's activities in Arabia, has a history of nearly 30 years. Although there have been some separations and changes during this period, they have established a deep foundation in political, economic, and military aspects. After the start of the European War, they stationed heavy troops in this corner, with General Wavell, commander of the Near East Army, sitting in Palestine. In addition, the British Navy has always controlled the sea power of the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, even if Syria is no longer a base for resisting Germany, the British still have an absolute advantage, which the Axis powers cannot match. Now Germany has obtained the convenience of transporting troops through Syria, and that place is no less than 500 nautical miles away from the nearest base of Germany and Italy. In addition, the naval fortress of Cyprus lies not far from the Syrian coast, and it is impossible for Germany and Italy to transport large armies. It is expected that the only way the Nazis can use is in the sky—transporting air force and troops. If the British prevent it carefully, it will not be easy to achieve. The worrying thing is that if this war continues in an expanding situation, the various problems contained within that region, such as the Jewish-Arab dispute in Palestine, have troubled Britain for many years. Although it has temporarily calmed down in the past two years, the dispute has not been resolved. The long-brewing Pan-Arab movement has always regarded Britain as an obstacle in its path, and it is also the goal that the Axis powers have been trying to use. Although the head of this movement, King Ibn Saud of Hejaz, has always stood on the side of Britain, and Mussolini, who claims to be the savior of Islam, has also caused widespread resentment among Muslims because of the annexation of Albania, this action in Iraq has clearly been used by the Nazis. Yemen has always been in alliance with aggressive countries and has close ties with Italy. What's more, because of the accumulation of various historical evils, even some clear-headed Muslims do not regard the Nazi victory as a place to pin their hopes for their own liberation movement, nor do they feel any interest in the British victory. When the opportunity arises, they will inevitably explode in actions to seek independence and liberation. Even if it is not planned by Germany and Italy, it will cause major difficulties for the British. Perhaps the reason why the British army has been slow to advance in Iraq recently is to avoid overly stimulating the Arabs' feelings and is unwilling to act rashly. It is expected that the Axis powers will not only carry out military operations, but also make the greatest efforts in propaganda and agitation. What has been seen in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia may not be seen again in the Near East Mandate and the Arabian Peninsula. This threat may be more worrying than military responses.</p>
<p>For the moment, we can only hope that the Arab people deeply understand that no small or weak nation can obtain any guarantee of benefits from the victory of aggressors, and that acting as an accomplice, whether subjectively or objectively, will only cause trouble for themselves. The local British authorities should also pay close attention to the emotions of the general public and make good amends for historical mistakes. The traditional colonial policy will only increase their own troubles in times of crisis. Militarily, they must act decisively and quickly overcome various potential crises to stabilize the overall situation in the Near East. Of course, as Churchill said before, the final contest between Britain and Germany depends on the decisive battle in the Atlantic. If the Nazis are now working hard to launch a major war in the Near East, it proves that he is fully confident in the Atlantic and the English Channel. However, although the Iraqi oil fields and the Suez Canal are important, they are tangible gains and losses. What is even more precious is the prestige of the British Empire. If they had not suffered defeat in the Balkan campaign, perhaps Vichy would have been more tough on Germany? At this critical moment, we sincerely hope that the British authorities can make effective responses in a meticulous and flexible manner.</p>

Many believe that these negotiations, which are being carried out immediately after the establishment of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact, are meaningful, because the Chinese army is currently tracking down and pursuing the Japanese.

<h3>Hull Says Franco-German Cooperation Endangers Western Hemisphere Security; President's Condemnation of France is Well-Founded; Vichy Denies Germany Will Occupy Dakar Port</h3>
<p>Washington, Secretary of State Hull declared here yesterday that official sources have confirmed that President Roosevelt's condemnation of certain actions of the Vichy government and his feelings about Franco-German cooperation are well-founded. Hull refused to directly comment on the sharp reaction of the Vichy government to President Roosevelt's frank condemnation of Franco-German cooperation, continuing that the State Department has received multiple reports indicating that Franco-German cooperation does endanger the security of the Western Hemisphere, according to a United Press dispatch on the 18th.</p>
<p>Vichy, US Ambassador to France Leahy stated yesterday that there has been no change in US-French diplomatic relations, and he will continue to stay in Vichy to maintain regular contact with the French government and General Pétain. Various rumors circulating outside are not credible, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 18th.</p>
<p>Vichy, the French Information Agency announced tonight that a report in the New York Times stated that Darlan had discussed with Hitler the issue of Germany occupying the French West African port of Dakar. This statement has been formally denied by the government. Dakar belongs to France, and the government has been closely monitoring it and is prepared to resist any foreign aggression, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<p>Washington, Florida Senator Pepper advocated yesterday that the United States should seize Dakar and other French military strongholds to prevent them from being used by Germany to endanger the Western Hemisphere. He accused Germany of using force or cooperating with the Vichy government to take over Dakar as a base for attacking South America. Pepper made these remarks after meeting with President Roosevelt, but he said that this speech was purely his own idea and was not authorized by President Roosevelt. However, it is recalled that Pepper is known for creating "trial balloons" to test public reaction. If his exploratory remarks receive a sympathetic response, they often become part of government policy. Pepper pointed out that the United States seizing Dakar and other key points could avoid future bloodshed because if Germany occupies these strongholds, it would be much more difficult for the United States to resolve the issue, according to a United Press dispatch on the 18th.</p>
<p>Vichy, the cabinet usually holds a weekly meeting on Saturdays, but it did not take place today, which surprised many people, according to a Havas dispatch on the 17th.</p>
<p>Vichy, after studying the news from Washington yesterday, the French government concluded that the stationing of US coastal defense forces on the Normandie and other French ships stranded in US ports did not constitute confiscation of those ships because the United States still allows French crew members to reside on the ships. However, unconfirmed reports claim that France may suspend weekly sailings to Martinique from Marseille to prevent further ships from being seized, according to a United Press dispatch on the 18th.</p>
<p>Ottawa, an editorial in the Montreal Daily Gazette argues that the Vichy envoy to Canada should not be recognized because the envoy is clearly a representative of the German command. The newspaper also suggests that Canada should take over the French islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 18th.</p>

<h3>Pravda Editorial Says Soviet Union is Prepared to Respond; Closely Monitoring Situation; Completes Steel Production Plan Ahead of Schedule</h3>
<p>Moscow, the Communist Party's newspaper "Pravda" recently published an editorial calling on the people to obey the orders of the Communist Party and fulfill their sacred duty to defend the motherland, stating that Soviet citizens should be prepared to respond to any eventuality. The Soviet government and the Communist Party, under the guidance of Comrade Stalin, are closely monitoring the development of the situation, and the Red Army has also completed preparations to crush any enemy offensive, according to a Havas dispatch on the 18th.</p>
<p>Moscow, in the first half of May, the steel production of various agencies under the jurisdiction of the Soviet People's Committee for Iron and Non-Ferrous Metals Industry exceeded the original plan. The average daily production of iron increased by 3.1%, and steel production increased by 1.9% (compared to the same period in April). From May 10th to 15th, the daily production of rolled metal increased by 5.9% compared to May 1st to 10th. The Chai Yuqiji Factory recently issued a declaration requesting workers in the metal industry to complete the six-month production plan ahead of schedule. Workers in various factories unanimously responded and replied to the factory, stating their determination to increase production. Factories such as the Stalin Nizhnek Tagil plant have indicated that they can complete the six-month production plan ahead of schedule. A letter from the workers of the Magnitogorsk plant stated, "The country requires us to produce more steel to supply the Red Army and Navy with the sharpest weapons." Regarding this matter, Pravda commented, "We are currently completing the great task of building a communist society. This work is being carried out during the expansion of the imperialist war. The Soviet people are currently outside the war. Under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet government is pursuing a steady foreign policy and a policy aimed at the socialist interests of the Soviet people. This policy is purely backed by the strength of our motherland and the Red Army and Navy. If any enemy dares to strike us, we will retaliate with a two or three times more destructive strike. The 18th Party Congress requested the Soviet people to strive for new achievements in industry and transportation. The Soviet people's struggle to overcome difficulties has now been successful. Their patriotic awareness is very high and they will not compromise with the enemies of socialism. At the same time, their confidence in victory is extremely strong. This mentality has become even more fervent due to industrial and various successes. At present, the Soviet people can use their achievements to actively strive for future victories. Soviet soldiers never forget the hard work of the manufacturers when using their war equipment. Factories 8 and 13 have been awarded various medals by the government for their special achievements in manufacturing military supplies. Soviet arms workers directly participate in the work of consolidating national defense. Their efficiency is extremely high because they are always thinking about strengthening national defense. They all have the determination to inflict a fatal blow on the aggressors. The Soviet people love military science and can use any war equipment. No other people in the world love their national army more than the Soviet people. At the same time, the Soviet people are writing a heroic page in the history of world culture. They are moving forward along the path of communism. Our strength is now enhanced on the border and in the country," according to a TASS dispatch on the 17th.</p>

Britain has always promoted victory, treated military victory as a success, placed hope on promises, and taken hope as a treasure. It is fitting that regrets and disappointments are piling up. Britain's friend today will become its enemy tomorrow. What Britain still relies on today will turn against it tomorrow. It can be seen that the collapse of Britain is only a matter of time," according to a Reuters dispatch on the 18th.</p>

<h3>A Record of the London Fire</h3>
<p>At ten o'clock, we found a young coachman with jet-black hair, exceptionally shiny, who said he was very willing to see the fire scene, so he was willing to take us anywhere. He also heard that the flames had advanced towards St. Paul's Cathedral, and the City Hall was already on fire. Before we arrived, it might have been reduced to rubble.</p>
<p>We asked him to drive in the direction of the reddest sky, and then to St. Paul's Cathedral.</p>
<p>We lowered the rear window of the car and watched the sky from outside the window. As the car turned, we smelled the first whiff of burning. City fires usually carry a strong smell of rubber and the bitter smell of tar roofs. But this time, we didn't smell any of that.</p>
<p>After driving for a while, we arrived at a street where the police had blocked traffic. The coachman stopped the car, and we stuck our press passes out of the car window. The policeman saluted and waved us through. This made a deep impression on the coachman. He thought we were just two busybodies looking for excitement, but he didn't know we were reporters. After that, whenever we reached a police cordon, he would stick his head out of the window solemnly and say, "We are reporters." But the streets were blocked by fire trucks, so we had to stop the car and walk forward. We were shocked to see that the fire started in a house we were familiar with. It was a six-story building, originally the location of a newspaper and a news agency. The top floor was burning, sparks flying everywhere, and the roof had collapsed. We had been in this house several times, sitting at desks full of manuscripts, talking to reporters we knew. The windows on the ground floor were all pitch black. Except for the sound of hoses spraying water and the cracking sound of water being poured on the red-hot beams, everything was quiet.</p>
<p>The firefighters told us that the fire was raging and that St. Paul's Cathedral was already on fire. Margaret suggested going to see if her beloved cathedral was safe. This cathedral was a small, beautiful building in the middle of a row of old, rat-infested houses, but as we ran closer, what we saw was like a cathedral on Christmas Eve in a Christmas card. We only saw its dark side, with the holy fire shining through the windows, but the flickering firelight was unsettling. The firefighters had opened the doors of the cathedral, and the firelight was also shining out from the doors. We didn't avoid the heat and tried to walk as close to the doors as possible. The cathedral looked like an oven. The roof had collapsed, and the glowing beams had fallen on the ashes of the sanctuary. As we watched this magnificent building burn to rubble, we also thought that after the war, the people would enthusiastically donate money to rebuild an even greater cathedral. But Margaret was already heartbroken and couldn't bear to watch any longer.</p>
<p>We were surrounded by smoke and fire. Margaret also said that the smell was very peculiar. It wasn't the usual smell of wood, but somewhat fragrant. It was the smell of oak beams used after the first Great Fire of London 250 years ago, mixed with the scorched smell of the ancient records of the major commercial companies that had supported the British Empire for centuries. There was no more precious rose scent than the one from the burning of London. The scent still lingered on our clothes when we walked back to the car.</p>
<p>As we drove towards St. Paul's Cathedral, we passed a street with fire hoses crisscrossing like gray, thick chains. We drove carefully, weaving through the gaps filled with vehicles, and had to stop and go from time to time. I hope I never see this kind of scene again in my life. Except for our car, the rest were all fire trucks—nothing more than hose trucks and trucks carrying pumps, grappling hooks, and ladders—slowly driving into the fire in front.</p>
<p>We turned into a small alley and got out of the car to walk. Although the polite British police hadn't forced us to stop, and we had passes and could move forward, it seemed wrong to go on. The coachman said he had never seen this kind of tragic scene and didn't want to see it again in the future. We got out of the car, and he followed behind, only two steps away. We never noticed it.</p>
<p>As soon as we got out of the car, we felt a strong wind. Margaret's skirt was blowing up, and pieces of paper were dancing in the wind. I pressed my hat tightly with my hand, but I wouldn't hate wearing a hat when I went to the movies. Was the wind sudden? Had we not noticed the wind before we walked past those houses!</p>
<p>We turned into St. Paul's Cathedral Square and saw that the cathedral was still safe and sound. We could faintly make out the roof watchmen patrolling under the dome. But the street behind the cathedral was already on fire, and the buildings on the right were in danger of collapsing at any moment. The side facing the chapel was still dark, but the fire was raging and occasionally shining through the windows.</p>
<p>We walked through the fire ladders, crossed the coiled hoses, and went to the burning street behind to see the fire.</p>
<p>It was a dirty commercial area. We were surprised to stand in front of a small jewelry store and see a small, white tongue of fire extending from a gap in the black wall, illuminating the entire room like a dim electric light. As we were watching, another piece of plaster fell off the wall, and then a tongue of fire came out. After that, more and more tongues of fire appeared, and the entire wall caught fire in an instant. The gold and silver jewelry in the jewelry boxes glittered in the fire. This was a small jewelry store with only jewelry that poor people could rarely afford. There were also wedding rings that soldiers bought for women and framed photos that women bought for soldiers.</p>
<p>Pure white light often shot out from the jewelry boxes, and then quickly disappeared. The temperature inside the store must have been very high. Ghost fires danced on the counters. This may have been the jewelry exploding, but it seemed more like the celluloid combs suddenly catching fire.</p>
<p>The straps of the watches in the window were writhing in the fire like snakes, and the pigskin on the frames was also bursting. Where was the owner of this store? What would he do when he returned tomorrow and saw that his store had been burned to ashes? If we broke the window and took out some of his treasures, how could we tell what was valuable and what was not? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>De Gaulle's Broadcast: Calls on French People in Syria to Take Up Arms and Expel the Enemy</h3>
<p>London – The Free French News Agency's Cairo dispatch states that General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French movement in the Middle East, broadcast an appeal urging the French people in Syria to rise up against the policy of surrendering Syria to Germany. The full text of his statement reads: "There are those who tell you that the enemy does not covet French colonies and will not seize Syria. This is a lie. Syria is now being handed over to Germany so that Germany can use Syria as an eastern base to control England. Enemy aircraft, some with French flags painted on them to disguise their identities, have landed in Syria in the past four days and then flown away. Do you know where these aircraft are going? Some are flying to Iraq to help attack British forces, while others are taking over your land. Germany always sends troops deep into a country gradually before occupying all of its territory. This tactic is now being applied to Syria. Eight hundred tons of munitions stored in Baalbek are now being taken out and transported by rail to Baghdad to support the Axis powers' war effort within Iraq. There is no other name for this but aiding the enemy and treason. If you do not stop it, intentional aiding of the war and treason will be a stain on you and you will lose your honor. Soldiers, I know you will never agree to this shameful policy. Rise up quickly, take up arms, and expel the enemy!" (May 18th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Fluid Battles in the Western Desert; Most German Mechanized Troops Captured; Continued Fighting in Abyssinia; South African Air Force Launches Large-Scale Patrols</h3>
<p>Cairo – The battles in the Western Desert are now concentrated on the border and are not large-scale offensives, but rather fluid battles in the area between the border barbed wire and Jarabub. If the British forces can continue to inflict losses on the enemy in terms of troops and equipment, it does not matter much whether the battles take place inside or outside Egyptian territory. The British forces are now quite effective in capturing enemy soldiers and destroying enemy equipment. The captured enemy soldiers are all mechanized infantry and tank crews. Many of the tank crews were captured on foot after their tanks were destroyed by British artillery fire. The British counter-offensive at Tobruk has made the enemy feel the danger of a large artillery base behind them. Around Amba Alagi in Abyssinia, continuous fighting continues. The Italian forces there are holding strong positions, and both sides are vying for the highlands. The British side is making daily gains. The fate of Amba Alagi and its garrison of 10,000 to 15,000 troops is now sealed, and its fall is imminent.

<h3>Rice and Coal Prices Have Fallen: Hope for People's Livelihood Revival. Hope that the Authorities Will Persistently Enforce Orders. Rice Prices Will Not Be Difficult to Fall Below 100 Yuan. Rice Hoarding Depreciations and Competing Sales with the Authorities Will Have a Good Response</h3>
<p>Within the two concession areas, the various firms that have purchased foreign rice from the Public Works Department (工部局) number approximately 740. In addition to the existing 600+ rice firms, more will go to the祥茂洋行 today to pay and retrieve goods from the godowns for market sale. Therefore, starting today, all rice firms in the two concession areas will be selling all of the foreign rice purchased from the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Hoarders Depreciate and Sell: Benefit to the Common People</p>
<p>Last week's rice prices plummeted due to the large influx of Hong Kong and Rangoon rice handled by the Public Works Department, resulting in thicker stocks, and the reduction in shipping costs between Shanghai and Rangoon. The market price of small grained rice was about 7 yuan lower than the price set by the Public Works Department. Yesterday, the reporter specifically inquired with relevant parties whether this matter would affect the sales volume of the Public Works Department's foreign rice. It was said that the hoarders in this city, feeling that the large quantities of rice they had hoarded could not be sold when the Public Works Department's cheap foreign rice was on sale, were competing to depreciate prices and seek to sell them off, thus falling below the price of the Public Works Department's foreign rice. This phenomenon was not only anticipated by the authorities, but it was also the purpose of the authorities' handling of cheap Hong Kong rice. The more that large hoarders depreciate prices to sell off, the more that citizens can obtain even cheaper rice.</p>
<p>Rice Price Difference: Will Be Improved</p>
<p>However, the price difference between the rice depreciated and sold by large hoarders and the price set by the Public Works Department is currently too large. The authorities will have a good method to improve it, ensuring that citizens can obtain the lowest-priced rice. Also, according to a certain rice firm owner, more than a hundred rice firms that have not yet completed the payment procedures will go to handle the procedures for taking delivery of goods today, and will definitely not stop taking delivery because the market price of rice is lower than the price of the Public Works Department's foreign rice.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Hong Kong Rice: To Be Shipped to Shanghai Within Days</p>
<p>The Hong Kong rice purchased by the Public Works Department from Hong Kong was again loaded by the British company Jardine Matheson's裕生轮 with more than 10,000 bags yesterday. The ship docked at the Bund码头 outside the新开河 at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, and unloading began at noon. The rice ordered by the Public Works Department from Hong Kong: the first batch was 55,000 bags, and the total amount of the second batch was 24,112 bags, with a total amount of more than 79,000 bags. It is heard that Taikoo's嘉应轮 and岳州轮 are also loaded with Hong Kong rice from the Public Works Department, and they can arrive in Shanghai within days. According to reporter's inquiry, in order to prevent people from purchasing and hoarding the Public Works Department's foreign rice,立基洋行 will issue a registry book for selling rice today, ordering all rice firms to register the amount of the Public Works Department's foreign rice sold daily for verification.</p>
<p>Cheap Rice Trading: Must Comply with Laws and Regulations</p>
<p>Cheap Hong Kong rice has already started to be resold in the storefronts of various legal rice firms within the two concession areas. Citizens must purchase rice in accordance with the regulations, and it is strictly forbidden to incite crowds to riot or deliberately find excuses. At the same time, if any selling rice firms do not sell rice in accordance with the regulations, the rice-purchasing common people can directly report them to the authorities. It is understood that the authorities, in view of the issuance of Hong Kong rice, are purely aimed at suppressing rice prices and relieving the people's suffering. In order to eliminate malpractices, they have sent subordinates to secretly investigate various selling rice firms. If any rice firms are found to have illegal behavior, they will be arrested and investigated in accordance with the law, without any leniency, in order to warn the rest and stabilize the market situation. However, according to reports, yesterday a small number of rice firms, when encountering common people purchasing cheap rice, replied that there was a price but no rice, and the lowest rice price was still sold at 116 yuan. If this is true, it is truly a strange phenomenon in the midst of the rice market's loudly proclaimed price drops. The authorities should investigate the actual situation to correct it.</p>
<p>Small Grained Rice Will: Enter the 100 Yuan Threshold</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain rice industry magnate told people that the panic over the people's food in this city has gradually become a thing of the past, and residents' hidden worries about food can also be relieved. According to his observation, the rice prices of all grades in this city will continue to fall. Small grained rice will soon enter the 100 yuan threshold. Currently, illegal transactions in the rice market have disappeared invisibly. Afternoon rice trading has also been promoted and prohibited by the authorities, so general speculative rice merchants have now exhausted their tricks, and it is clear that they cannot continue to be active. He also said that shipping costs for rice will soon decrease one after another, and the prospects for the people's food in this city will gradually improve.</p>
<p>Two Authorities' Edicts: To Suppress and Stabilize the Coal Market</p>
<p>The market price of煙白煤斤 (white briquette coal) previously had coal brokers making trouble, and the market once reached an unprecedented peak. According to news from various coal industry associations yesterday, the authorities of the two concession areas, in view of the rising market price of coal斤, are purely speculative manipulation and monopoly, and the frequent rise in coal prices affects the people's livelihood and social order no less than rice. In addition to actively finding ways to increase coal-loading ships, the two authorities have now invited the responsible persons of major coal companies to advise them to take into consideration social order and cooperate with the authorities, and not to regard煙白煤斤 as speculative items and continue to hoard and raise prices. They also ordered that the selling price of all kinds of煙白煤斤 must not continue to rise. If it is found that there are unauthorized increases in coal prices, the authorities will investigate and deal with them in accordance with the law, without any leniency, in order to warn the rest and stabilize the market situation.</p>
<p>Coal Ball Black Market: Prices Have Already Fallen</p>
<p>It is now known that the number of coal-carrying ships has increased compared to before, and the shipping costs for coal have been checked and reduced by the various shipping companies. Furthermore, the source of coal斤 in the future will become more abundant. Coal merchants holding goods and order forms are in a dilemma and are generally lowering prices to sell off their existing goods or warehouse receipts, and their trading in the market is very difficult. However, there are few people interested. It is now heard that No. 2闻平块 has fallen from 400 yuan per ton to 375 yuan, and同得利white coal has fallen from 456 yuan to 440 yuan. As for the coal ball black market, it has entered the 300 yuan threshold.华通 warehouse receipts still lack interested parties.</p>
<p>Recently Completed Transactions: More Than 200,000 Tons</p>
<p>According to news from various coal companies yesterday, the production price in the Indian and Annam coal-producing areas has fallen. For the sake of foresight, general coal merchants have sent telegrams to overseas coal-producing areas to order large quantities of煙白煤斤. As of now, the total amount that has been formally transacted has reached 210,000 to 220,000 tons, which will be loaded on ships and shipped to Shanghai within the next half month. It is learned that about half of this is coal dust needed to manufacture coal balls. According to a certain coal industry magnate, the stock of煙白煤斤 in this city is becoming more abundant, totaling about 430,000 tons.</p>

<h3>There Are Many Japanese Military Supplies: In the Bombed Freight Car. Traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Was Restored Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to people from Wuxi yesterday, after the bombing of a train near Hushu Pass west of Suzhou in the early morning of the 16th, although it was repaired that night, only two trains a day departed from Shanghai and Nanjing on the 16th and 17th. The normal state of traffic will be restored today (ie 18th). What was bombed that morning was a long line of freight cars. It is heard that many military supplies were loaded, so the losses were considerable. According to people from the area, when Yu took the car to Shanghai passing through the bombed site, he saw that the locomotive had been removed, but there were still four freight cars overturned on the side of the road, which had been damaged beyond repair. About ten zhang of the track had been bombed away, so the roadbed was severely damaged. When the vehicle passed, it drove slowly to prevent overturning. The repeated destruction of the Shanghai-Nanjing Line has fully proven that the Japanese side's road protection work has completely failed. In the past, because the Japanese side was afraid that the railway would be destroyed, it ordered all villages along the railway to organize "Railway Protection Groups." East of Wuxi, every ten telegraph poles, there was a small pointed sentry box next to the railway, where personnel from the "Road Protection Group" were stationed every day. In case of an alarm, they had to report to the Japanese army at any time. Otherwise, in case of an accident, the "Group" had to be responsible. In addition, east of Suzhou, the Japanese recently built a small station to facilitate the defense of key sections. Electrified nets have long been set up, but guerrillas can still move freely. It can be seen that the above road protection measures are ineffective.</p>

<h3>The Current Power Restriction Measures: Will Remain Effective Temporarily. There Is Hope for an Increase in Fuel Supply. The Special Committee's Proposal Should Be Postponed</h3>
<p>Shanghai Power Company is issuing the following notice regarding the temporary postponement of the implementation of power restrictions: "After reviewing the report of the Special Committee on April 8 of this year regarding power restrictions, it has been approved by the company and approved by the Shanghai Public Works Department at a meeting on May 14 of this year. The restriction measures stipulated in the report have now been approved by the Public Works Department at the request of the company for temporary postponement. The reason for the request for postponement is that several important discussions are in progress and will soon indicate the amount of fuel that can be reliably delivered in the coming months. The company believes that industries should not be restricted during the period when there is still hope for an increase in fuel supply. However, the length of this postponement depends entirely on the outcome of the current discussions and whether the company's fuel reserves can maintain a quantity equal to 100,000 tons of coal. During this temporary postponement, all current restriction rules and fees will continue to be effective. These rules and fees have been announced by the company in the newspaper on April 21 of this year. All users related to the notice have also been notified by separate letters. These circulars shall remain in effect until further notice. This is specially announced."</p>

The details of the interrogation have been recorded in this newspaper. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a public prosecution for the crime of false reporting and fraud, and requested that they be investigated and dealt with in accordance with the law.

<h3>Yunnan Province Actively Promotes National Education - This Year's Subsidy Increased to One Million Yuan</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) In order to actively promote national education, the Ministry of Education has issued a general order to all provinces to draft a five-year plan for the promotion of national education and a partial implementation plan for the 30th year based on local conditions, and submit them to the Ministry for verification. Upon receiving the order, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education immediately followed the regulations of the Ministry of Education and, considering the province's environment, drafted an implementation plan and reported it. This year, the province should establish 3,000 national schools and 1,000 central schools. Regarding funding, the National National Education Conference decided last year to subsidize each province by 25% annually. However, due to different situations in each province, no decision was made. The central government originally planned to subsidize this province with 400,000 yuan this year, but the Ministry of Education has increased it to one million yuan. This funding is limited to the expenses of promoting national education and short-term teacher training in various counties.</p>

<h3>Orphan's Paradise (1) Willow</h3>
<p>Orphanhood is the most unfortunate experience for a child; I also lost my father at the age of eleven and relied on my mother to raise me to adulthood. It is pitiful that in my childhood, when I saw children with fathers, happy and carefree, I thought of where my father had gone, and I could not help but burst into tears.</p>
<p>The cruel war is imposed on the masses for no reason, and I don't know how many families have been destroyed and people have been displaced. The orphans and widows cannot be written by emptying the bamboo of the South Mountain; the turbulent emotions in my heart cannot be washed away by pouring out the water of the West River. In the world, countless fatherless orphans have been added, wandering, starving, unfortunately dying in ditches, and fortunately encountering saviors. What I am talking about now is an orphan who is unfortunate but fortunate.</p>
<p>Originally, in my hometown, wars were frequent. There was a family named Yang, who were brokers, with a family of five. The man was a manager of a small shop, and he could have lived a comfortable life, but unexpectedly, he was repeatedly hit by wars, and the whole town was reduced to ruins. Yang was no exception. His house was destroyed, and his store property was gone. In a moment of anxiety and anger, he died. The wife and three children left behind, in China's economic organization where men are the unit of production, have reached this point, and it is really impossible for women to do anything, and crying is of no use. Later, after various efforts, the eldest son was recommended to work as an apprentice in a small shop. The youngest daughter was adopted by someone else. The wife came out to work as a helper. There was still a boy left, who was living in someone else's house, but at 140 to 150 yuan per stone of rice, he had to help with at least 30 yuan per month. How could she afford it? If this problem is not solved, how can she get it! Later, with the help of Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, the child was actually sent to the Tushanwan Orphanage - Ciyun Primary School. Although their family of four was living in four different places, they each had a place to settle down, which was really a stroke of good luck and a blessing from heaven.</p>
<p>One morning, the sun was warm and the wind was gentle. Mr. Zhu Zhiyao borrowed a car, and I brought the child, and the three of us rode in the car together. We sped along the asphalt road as if we were flying on a soft carpet. Soon, we saw the twin towers of the Xujiahui Catholic Church standing tall. Our car drove straight towards the clock tower. After a while, we arrived in Xujiahui Town in the western end of the French Concession. Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, a vigorous old man, did not need to hire a rickshaw. So, one old man, one strong man, and one child got out of the car and walked, crossing small bridges, passing through barbed wire fences, and stepping into the church area. Along the muddy Puzhao River, the white walls of the church reflected each other, black and white were distinct, and the pure sincerity of Catholicism was even more obvious. After passing through the church gate, the towering two bell towers were even more friendly than when we had seen them before! I couldn't help but recall that fourteen years ago, Mr. Zhu Yanzhi had once introduced and guided a small group of us to visit the library and astronomical instruments of the Catholic Church, but it was a fleeting glimpse, and the observatory was far away in Sheshan. What we saw was only a small part of the instruments related to earthquakes. Although I can also say that Shanghai is my second hometown, this was my first time visiting the Xujiahui Church area. Talking and talking along the way, I looked up and saw the words "Tushanwan" on the white wall. We had arrived at our destination. There was a bridge across the river called Ciyun, which was built by Mr. Zhu Zhiyao. It can be said to be the first steel-framed concrete bridge in Nanshi. It has been decades now, and it only cost 200 taels of silver at that time. Next to the road is the Tushanwan Orphanage. As soon as we entered the door, a friendly doorman came out to greet us. This point made me think of something else. I also like to go to temples to follow the joy, but how snobbish are the monks; I have also been to groups of places to visit, but how arrogant is the camp door; in fact, these people's eyes are too blurred; people, are all people, why bother to distinguish between thick and thin, only recognize clothes and not people, is it not the human relations that should be in society!</p>

<h3>Our Country's Current Labor-Management Conflicts Ji Ze</h3>
<p>Simply put, labor-management conflict is a dispute caused by the unequal distribution of interests between labor and management. This unequal distribution of interests dates back to the era of slavery after the system of private property, but at that time, productivity was weak and the people were unenlightened, so there was no so-called conflict between masters and slaves. After the Industrial Revolution, productivity greatly increased, and the wage system developed. At the same time, the conflict of interest between labor and management became increasingly serious, emotional ties became increasingly estranged, and the disparity between the rich and the poor became increasingly severe, until labor and management each became a major class. In modern times, with the development of industry, the standard of living has gradually improved, and prices have continued to rise. Workers' lives have become increasingly difficult. Coupled with changes in thinking, the unity of the working class and the occurrence of labor-management conflicts are inevitable.</p>
<p>Our country is not an industrially developed country, but a country full of semi-colonial and semi-feudal characteristics. The labor-management conflicts that occur in this kind of society are certainly not entirely the same as those in capitalist countries. It has its own characteristics; especially today when the country is in dire straits, labor and management share the same interests, stand on the same ground, and a bright future is equally built on the foundation of striving for national liberation. Therefore, the urgent task is to establish a united front between labor and management, and not to dig deep trenches between the two sides, resulting in the tragedy of internal strife.</p>
<p>The Content of Labor-Management Conflicts</p>
<p>The causes of labor-management conflicts can be broadly divided into two types: economic and management.</p>
<p>(1) Economic disputes are disputes between labor and management over the distribution of profits. During the recession of the business cycle, commodity prices fall, while the costs of raw materials and other items decrease very little. Corporate profits decrease, and the capitalists, in order to maintain the existence of the enterprise and the constant profit of capital, plan to reduce wages. Conversely, when all industries are booming, especially during wartime, everything is expensive, the value of money depreciates, the prices of products soar, and the value of inventory greatly increases, while labor costs decrease relatively. As a result, the capitalists take advantage of this opportunity to multiply their profits, while the laborers suffer and complain endlessly. Because the value of money depreciates, the cost of living increases, and their income is still estimated according to the past monetary value standard, so real wages plummet, and life becomes extremely difficult, so they demand additional allowances, hoping to get a reasonable share of the generous profits of the enterprise. If the former situation occurs and is opposed by the labor side, and the latter situation occurs and is rejected by the capital side, then disputes are inevitable, leading to strikes and shutdowns, which bring production to a standstill.</p>
<p>(2) Management conflicts are no less important than conflicts of economic interest, and the two are closely related. Management defects are particularly prone to occur in countries where science is underdeveloped, and are also related to the national character of acting emotionally. The so-called management disputes include disputes over working hours, disputes over the tyrannical attitude of superiors towards subordinates, demands for improvement in working conditions and material equipment, objections to employment and dismissal issues, and entanglements related to labor agreements. If this kind of conflict is not resolved for a long time, it can also disrupt the progress of production.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government in the 17th year of the Republic of China, labor-management conflicts have gradually decreased. Half of the reason for this is economic depression, and half is the adoption of stopgap policies by the National Government, such as the passage and implementation of the Amendment to the Labor-Management Dispute Act. Since the "August 13th" Incident, the country has faced a critical moment of survival, and the people should concentrate their manpower and financial resources to seek final victory. Any disputes must be resolved by peaceful and rational methods. However, in Shanghai, due to the special environment, the number of disputes has increased instead. Especially since the 29th year of the Republic of China, as prices have soared more quickly, the number of labor-management conflicts has been increasing day by day, which is extremely serious.</p>
<p>Judging from the 156 strikes and 62 disputes in Shanghai in the 28th year of the Republic of China, strikes arising from economic reasons accounted for 79.3% of the total cases; those arising from management reasons accounted for only 20.7%; and among management reasons, employment and dismissal were the most important, accounting for 17.2%; slightly less than the average of 20.7% over the past ten years; in economic cases, wages were the main factor, accounting for as much as 53.4%; the average for the past ten years was only 27.7%; an increase of more than double; allowance cases accounted for 25.9%; the average for the past ten years was only 1.88%; a surge of 14 times. As for the dispute cases in the 28th year of the Republic of China, those arising from management reasons accounted for 30.5% of the total amount, and those arising from economic reasons accounted for 69.5%. Among them, employment and dismissal cases suddenly dropped from the average of 65.6% since the 17th year of the Republic of China to 20.3% in the 28th year of the Republic of China, a reduction of more than three times. Wage cases rose from the average of 18.5% over the years to 30.5% in the 28th year of the Republic of China. Allowance cases soared to account for 39% of the total cases, exceeding the average of previous years by more than eight times. This is the content of labor-management conflicts in Shanghai in the 28th year of the Republic of China and a rough comparison with the average of previous years.</p>
<p>With the development of capitalism, the opposition between the two major classes of labor and capital has become increasingly serious. In wartime, economic and financial changes easily promote the growth of labor-management conflicts. However, in our country today, any conflict is not permitted by reality. The author would like to briefly state a few words below:</p>
<p>(1) Our country is truly engaged in a long and arduous war of national liberation. The so-called long war is an economic war. In this war, the most basic task of both labor and management is to strengthen production. Therefore, in order to seek a bright future, both sides must first seek victory in the war, and striving to stabilize the economy and strengthen production is related to their own interests. Therefore, any disputes must be resolved with a good attitude of mutual understanding and mutual assistance, in order to achieve the fairness of profit distribution and the rationality of enterprise management, and achieve the goal of maximum production efficiency.</p>
<p>(2) Since the "August 13th" Incident, the supply and demand of materials has been abnormal, and prices have soared. All large and small enterprises have made a fortune from the national crisis. Workers' lives have been extremely difficult. Taking Shanghai as an example, although workers' nominal wages have increased, when converted into real wages, they have shrunk from 100 in the 25th year of the Republic of China to 55.33 in the 29th year of the Republic of China. While capitalists are rejoicing in windfall profits, they must know that part of such profits is actually obtained by exploiting workers. Because of the step-by-step depreciation of the currency, enterprises obtain labor services from workers that exceed the real labor cost. However, in terms of work efficiency, this kind of behavior is obviously unwise, because the weakening of the quality and quantity of products will inevitably follow. Therefore, under the goal of benefiting the country, benefiting oneself, and benefiting others, it is appropriate to allow workers to obtain a reasonable share of the profits.</p>
<p>(3) The success or failure of enterprise management has a great impact on the workers' working psychology, and the working psychology and production efficiency are closely related. This has long been noticed and confirmed by efficiency experts, but entrepreneurs in our country rarely pay attention to it, resulting in significant losses in intangible ways. This kind of psychological system transformation is nothing more than using various material and spiritual methods to make each worker thoroughly understand its importance in the national economy and factory manufacturing, so that each person deeply feels that the wages of all workers in the whole factory are equivalent to their labor services, without any favoritism or bullying, so that each worker maintains the highest degree of right to make suggestions, cancels unnecessary interference, in order to eliminate the gap between labor and management. Other things like the establishment of consumer cooperatives and workers' clubs, the promotion of remedial education and free medical care, and the handling of workers' welfare such as storage insurance are also necessary. Although this kind of expenditure seems superfluous, the tranquility of society depends on it, and the soaring on the production table will naturally make up for the losses and more.</p>
<h3>On the Inappropriateness of Cash Discount Mu Shens</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new monetary policy in our country, legal tender has been the only currency in the country. However, in Shanghai, there are three kinds of chips: (1) "Cash", (2) "Clearing", (3) "Remittance". Although the names are different, they are all legal tender. Except that cash is the main body of legal tender, that is, "spot chip", the so-called "clearing" and "remittance" are both "circulating chips" of legal tender, but the former can be cashed on the same day, while the latter must be cashed the next day. Therefore, in the past, the difference between "remittance" and "clearing" was only one day's interest. As for "cash" and "clearing", there was no distinction, and there was no doubt.</p>
<p>After the August 13th Incident, due to the provisions of the financial stability measures, "remittance" was limited to interbank transfers and could not be cashed. As a result, "remittance" became a "locked chip", all to prevent capital flight, while "clearing" could be cashed as usual. In other words, "clearing" can be exchanged for "cash", while "remittance" cannot. Therefore, the phenomenon of "remittance" exchanging for "clearing" must be discounted. At one point, the remittance discount rate was as high as several hundred yuan per thousand yuan. Now, the panic of remittance discounting has come to an end, and the discount rate is only a few yuan per thousand yuan. In principle, belonging to the same legal tender, remittance is exchanged for clearing, and a discount must be paid, which is not in line with the law. However, because one can be exchanged for cash and the other cannot, and because cash is indispensable in life, there are many people who are willing to suffer a discount loss, so the occurrence of this kind of discount can be misinterpreted in principle. Now, it is also necessary to discount cash for clearing, which is really puzzling! The reason why clearing is superior to remittance is only because clearing can be cashed for cash, while remittance cannot. Now, exchanging cash for clearing requires a discount, isn't this a strange thing?</p>
<p>Some say that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, people were panicked and hoarding cash, resulting in a shortage of cash supply. There was a feeling that it was not easy to obtain cash, so cash appreciation occurred. Then, cash appreciation due to demand exceeding supply seems to be able to produce a discount due to supply exceeding demand. Therefore, the current cash discount is based on the law of supply and demand, and has its own cause. As everyone knows, due to the lack of cash, it is not easy to obtain cash for clearing, resulting in a difference. It seems more accurate to call this difference "clearing discount" rather than "cash appreciation". However, the difference between "cash" and "clearing" today, whether it is called "cash discount" or "clearing appreciation", is not appropriate. Cash is the main body of our country's legal tender, which is certainly not comparable to the banknotes in the silver currency era of the past. As for clearing, it is a kind of chip representing the circulation of legal tender, and its cashing is still based on cash as the country's image.</p>
<p>Based on the above, cash is the only currency in our country, and whether it is "appreciation" or "discount" is not a normal state of currency. If there is an imbalance in the supply and demand of currency, the financial industry has the responsibility to regulate it. Issuing banks are undoubtedly responsible, and other general banks or money shops should also work together to complete the important task of stabilizing social finance. For example, if there is a shortage of cash in the market, banks should find ways to supply it to meet social needs; conversely, if there is a surplus of cash in the market, banks should also absorb it as much as possible and supply clearing, which is called tightening currency. Now, the cash discount in Shanghai has been going on for more than a month. In early April, the discount for exchanging cash for clearing was as high as more than 30 yuan per ten thousand yuan, and it is still around 10 yuan. The majority of silver and money industries recognize the difficulties and respond appropriately. However, there are also some banks and money shops that do not have enough understanding and use the excuse of cash discount to impose restrictions on depositors depositing cash, or refuse to accept it, and even use the phrase "only handle cash" as a reason for returning checks for depositors of the same industry who come to exchange them. Once this end is opened, all checks for clearing are in danger of being returned, which will hinder the circulation of bills and pre-echo social finance, which is extremely important and huge. Furthermore, it allows the general speculators to take advantage of the situation, while the banks and money shops themselves are scolded by society; what could be more foolish and absurd than this?</p>
<p>Think about it, the cash received by industry and commerce in daily business operations is best deposited in banks and money shops as its only reasonable outlet. If the banks do not accept it as much as possible, how will these people dispose of their cash income? This is one.</p>
<p>The exchange method used by the same industry can avoid the risk of cash collection and settlement. Even banks that are not in the same exchange range, such as foreign banks collecting bills from Chinese banks, also pay with "exchange checks" to show solemnity and avoid danger. Now that the phenomenon of cash settlement has occurred, at this time and in this place, the risk of settling and receiving cash from each other is even greater. This is two.</p>
<p>The above two points are all superficial views. There are many wise people in the financial industry who will definitely check this as soon as possible. As for the banks and money shops that have lost control of their behavior, they only account for a minority. I hope that our entire financial industry, under the leadership of banks, will correct its mistakes if it has any, and encourage itself if it has none, in order to seek the early elimination of cash discount. Or it is said that the refusal to accept cash and the use of "only settle cash" as a reason for returning checks are all caused by cash discount. As everyone knows, this is mutually causal, and to seek the elimination of cash discount, one must first try to get banks to accept cash as much as possible, and can use clearing as usual to be effective. Otherwise, the existence and rise of cash discount is expected, which is a burden on the future of industry and agriculture, and is not a blessing for the financial industry itself.

<h3>On Today's Labor Problems (Part 1) Hu Xishan</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen combat effectiveness, increasing production is the current urgent task; we all know that labor is one of the factors of production, especially under the current economic structure of our country, because various places cannot fully obtain the use of machinery, manpower feels important. In the past, general capitalists believed that machines were the only essential element of production, while neglecting labor, which was a huge mistake. If labor problems are not properly addressed first, how can industry be revitalized? Among labor problems, wages, technical training, and labor-management coordination are all important matters. At this time of war, the need for materials has increased dramatically. If we want to increase production to adapt to this current need, how can we avoid labor-management disputes? How to improve the lives of workers? How to improve work efficiency? These are all problems worth studying. This article will make a brief review of the practical problems of labor today.</p>
<p>Improvement of Labor-Management Relations</p>
<p>The most difficult problem between labor and management is how to seek cooperation between labor and management to resolve all disputes between them? In socialist countries, labor and management are not divided, so there is no so-called labor-management dispute. However, under normal circumstances, labor and management often stand in opposite positions; labor always hopes that management can improve its treatment, while management, for its own benefit, is never willing to thoroughly satisfy the desires of labor. In principle, this is a relationship of mutual interests. The fundamental solution is to enable labor and management to coordinate. How to coordinate? This is a broad and complex important issue; the capital side should first understand the labor side, and give as much opportunity as possible to the labor, in order to encourage its spirit of cooperation. In any scale of industrial organization, managers and workers should take a consistent line of communication. The capital side should always be aware of the living conditions of the labor side under today's circumstances, as well as its general likes and dislikes and thoughts; at the same time, the labor side should be informed of the factory's current situation and the importance of wartime production, in order to strengthen the labor's work force; the operators of the industrial decision should also take into account the current situation of the country, and must not exploit the workers in order to make money; if the workers are exploited by the capitalists and live in poverty, the workers regard work as a hardship, and have no good feelings for the factory. Then the workers and foremen are prone to hatred, the workers cannot concentrate on their work, the work efficiency is reduced, and the lice tide is aroused, which is an inevitable phenomenon. Therefore, making the improvement of labor-management relations a primary condition for improving the production level and increasing the production quantity today.</p>
<p>Compulsory Mediation of Labor-Management Disputes</p>
<p>Disputes between labor and management are inevitable at any time. After the labor side is dissatisfied with the capital side, the labor movement is nothing more than a slowdown and a strike. In the case of a slowdown, the factory has not stopped working, and the workers still enter the factory to work, but the workers do not carry out the work according to the factory's purpose. The obvious phenomenon is deliberately delaying work and sabotaging factory objects; although this situation is not very serious, the product is drastically reduced and the damage to the factory is extremely serious. A strike means that the work of the entire factory is completely stopped. The impact is not only the cessation of production in that industry, but also the industries related to that industry will also bear joint damage; this phenomenon is extremely serious; the production functions of various industries in our country have been largely destroyed by the war; therefore, today's various types of products are mostly concentrated in a small number of industries; if there is a certain urgently needed item, now due to the strike of Industry A, the production is stopped, which affects Industry B, which is still related to it, and the same stops co-production because it cannot obtain the raw materials for manufacturing. To put it more broadly; the cessation of production in an industrial unit is enough to cause several related industries to stop at the same time. This situation will inevitably cause great obstacles to the industrial production of the time. In order to absolutely prevent the occurrence of labor-management disputes, we must try our best to avoid the occurrence of conflicts in advance, and implement compulsory means to mediate afterwards.</p>
<p>In order to obtain a fair and rapid solution to labor-management disputes, a wartime or special labor-management dispute arbitration committee can be set up, which will be organized jointly by the local government and labor-management representatives. The committee should resolve labor-management disputes in the most recent and rapid manner, and never prolong the date. First, it can conduct persuasion and explain the importance of the industry at present, so that it can reconcile and immediately resume production: in the case of important industries, when the labor side does not accept arbitration and the capital side is sure that it cannot accept its demands, the government can assist the capital side in handling it. If the capital side does not accept arbitration, the government can directly send personnel to take over the industry on behalf of the capital side in order to take into account the production of the industry, and pay all manufacturing expenses on behalf of the capital side, and accept the reasonable parts of the labor side's demands. During the production process, labor and management can still send representatives to mutually agree; after the government resolves the disputes between the two parties, it can still transfer its management responsibility, and the original capitalist will operate it.</p>

<p>Another dispatch: The following are the Indian cotton statistics from September 1, last year, to May 17, this year (each bale weighing 400 pounds):</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>High-Quality Toon Shoots Soar</h3>
<p>As subsequent batches of fresh toon shoots are scarce, the market trend is becoming even more expensive. Yesterday, the top dealer suddenly raised the price by 50 yuan, selling them for 350 yuan, with a decisive price of 300 yuan, with the most decisive price varying.</p>
<p>Seafood</p>
<h3>New Dried Fish Maw Offered</h3>
<p>Dried fish maw from Zhoushan is now being offered fresh, with the initial batch selling for 400 yuan, which can be considered an extremely high price. Fresh products from Ningbo have not yet been seen, and old goods are selling for 115 yuan.</p>
<p>New yellow croaker maw and dried cuttlefish have also appeared on the market, with the initial price at 850 yuan, and the market is showing strength.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics for Autumn and Winter Hoarding is Particularly Severe</h3>
<p>Recently, the trend of woolen fabrics varies due to differences in supply and demand, and diverse sources of production, resulting in uneven sales. It has been found that the most severely hoarded and increased prices among our colleagues are for autumn goods such as overcoating wool, heavy plain wool, Melton, suiting flannel, Homespun, Serge, riding breeches cloth, tweed, mohair, seabird cloth, single-sided flannel, broadcloth, medium-heavy serge, and hairline twill. The reasons for the price increases are due to the following facts and atmosphere: (1) Foreign firms must pay a deposit when ordering and prepay exchange bills, and insurance and additional charges are frequently increasing, so ordering transactions have now stopped. (2) As the European war spreads and expands, not only are the delivery dates of previously ordered goods delayed, but it is also unpredictable whether half of them can arrive in Shanghai. (3) Due to the same raw material transportation difficulties and increased expenses, the output of local factories is bound to be scarce and expensive. (4) Factories are not accepting orders, and middlemen are adding another 10% to the price and are also taking back sample books. (5) Many inside and outside people are focusing on this type of autumn and winter goods. (6) The atmosphere is tense, and people's hearts are high, so even though it is difficult to determine in advance what actual sales will be in the future, everyone is blindly following, trying to hoard as much as possible, which makes them increasingly popular and increasingly scarce.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Items</p>
<h3>The Speculative Air of Soap, Candles, and Matches Has Subsided</h3>
<p>The market situation for daily necessities last week was generally trending downward. For example, the price of soap previously soared due to the manipulation of speculative hoarders and the impact of the European war, which slightly reduced the supply of raw materials, and factories reduced the distribution of goods to colleagues to prevent market speculators from hoarding. However, the opposite happened, and the hoarding trend became more rampant, causing market prices to skyrocket. For example, the price of "Gu Ben" soap rose to a high of 60 yuan, which slightly weakened, leading to a large reduction in general purchases, and miscellaneous brand soaps rose to replace it. The firm had no choice but to stop trading with outsiders, but the results were minimal. Currently, speculators see that food and other items are generally reporting declines, and the international situation is fluctuating, with very few actual sales, making it difficult for the market to recover in a short period of time. Those who made profits are seeking to sell off their goods, leading to a glut of spot goods on the market, and colleagues are not eager to buy, so the market has declined in a straight line. For example, on Saturday, "Gu Ben" soap loosened to 56.5 yuan per case, "Bai Xiang Mao" soap to 46.5 yuan per case, "Huang Xiang Mao" soap to 41.2 yuan per case, and "Jian Dao" soap to 43 yuan per case, all falling by one or two yuan. The market for matches is also trending weakly, because sales on Wood Street are sluggish, and customers are not eagerly purchasing, causing prices to fall accordingly. "Mei Li" brand is 704 yuan per case, "Feng Huang" brand is 692 or 3 yuan per case, and miscellaneous brands are around 600 yuan. The candle market is calm, with "Fan Chuan" brand at 26.6 yuan per case and "Ji" brand at 26.5 yuan per case. Overall, the market situation is currently stable.</p>
<p>The Fuel Problem</p>
<h3>When Will it Fall Like the Price of Rice?</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented the public sale of rice, rice prices have been effectively stabilized. However, coal remains expensive, with white coal at 400+ yuan per ton and coal briquettes at 16 yuan per dan, making it difficult for most people to cook even with rice. Although the difficulty is not as great as having no rice, it still poses a great threat to daily life. It is said that the increase in coal prices is also due to water transportation costs. Those who make endless fortunes from war are only in the shipping industry. Not to mention foreign merchants owning huge numbers of ships and making huge profits, which may be several floors high, even those with three or four or even one or two ships have earned tens or hundreds of thousands of yuan in these three years. There is an old saying that "every day brings a peck of gold," but for today's shipping merchants, it is not just a peck of gold, but a stone's worth. Moreover, the hoarding and speculation of other goods is easily understood, but shipping merchants are quietly reaping huge profits without being noticed or condemned by the world. As a result, Chinese merchants who used to engage in the shipping industry are also regretting that they did not keep two ships when they saw others making a fortune, and that they were always dissatisfied with the unfairness of the world, which is often applied according to the person. Things that are difficult for ordinary people to do can be done by those with power. This is not unique to Shanghai. If there is a solution to controlling and manipulating the shipping industry, not only rice but also coal prices will easily fall by half.</p>
<p>But the facts cannot be said in this way. If so, coal merchants will secretly clap their hands and rejoice. If coal companies do not sell coal in bulk to hoarders, or if coal merchants do not close down and sell directly to users in batches, coal prices would not be so high. Because coal merchants and hoarders (insiders and outsiders) are in cahoots, all the coal is hoarded. Even if water transportation costs fall, coal prices will still not fall, and it will only benefit the hoarders. The black market price of coal briquettes was previously more than 16 yuan. Now, coal briquettes are becoming increasingly inferior, even mixing chimney coal ash with yellow mud and coal dust as a substitute. Hongji coal dust used to ignite quickly, but now it is used less, making it difficult to start a fire. Therefore, some people have come up with the idea of mixing wood chips to make it easier to ignite. The fire is easy to start, but the heat is not strong and burns quickly. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Seeing, Hearing, Thinking</h3>
<p>When purchasing and transporting the first batch of Hong Kong rice, the US exchange rate was only around 5.125 yuan, and the rice weevils had already caused such a big impact. Now the US exchange rate has reached 5.375 yuan, and it is not difficult to exceed the 5.5 yuan mark; moreover, the mold season is approaching; the anxiety of the hoarders can be imagined.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's operation and sale of foreign rice has achieved great results. It is hoped that they will further crack down on hoarding to eliminate chaos. What constitutes hoarding? The recently promulgated "Temporary Regulations for the Punishment of Violations of Food Management During Extraordinary Periods" by the National Government has the following provisions:</p>
<p>(1) Those who are not engaged in commerce or merchants who are not engaged in the food industry, but who purchase and hoard food for profit.</p>
<p>(2) Merchants engaged in the food industry who purchase and hoard food but do not sell it as stipulated by the food authorities.</p>
<p>(3) Food households who hoard surplus grain and evade and conceal it after being required to sell it by the food authorities (Article 3 of the law).</p>
<p>(4) Those who hoard 15 stones or more will be sentenced to detention or a fine of less than 1,000 yuan (Article 4, Paragraph 6 of the law).</p>
<p>(5) Without approval, civilian households shall not store more than two months' worth of food, nor shall they continue to purchase more than two months' worth; otherwise, it will be confiscated (Article 6 of the law).</p>
<p>It is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will refer to the local situation and also define hoarding so that citizens can report it.</p>
<p>Churchill did not pay Hess "wages" at all, and Hitler's "peace offensive" completely vanished like a bubble. In the speculative market, it became worthless.</p>
<p>Speculators have the most "naive" views on international issues and are the most likely to reach "conclusions."</p>

<h3>Life Elements</h3>
<p>— Shunqin</p>
<p>Life elements, also known as vitamins, are essential for people in life. When life elements are lacking, specific obstacles will occur in life, leading to diseases. According to what has been discovered and confirmed today, there are the following five types. The presence and function of each life element are briefly discussed below for the readers:</p>
<p>Vitamin A is mostly contained in the oils and fats of animals and plants. Butter, ghee, cod liver oil, mutton tallow, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, etc., all contain it. However, pork lard is completely lacking, and eggs and grains also contain a small amount. Those who lack vitamin A will develop dry conjunctivitis, and in severe cases, even blindness. This vitamin is also related to physical development; therefore, those who lack vitamin A should eat more egg yolks and liver. If one cannot afford to buy animal and plant fats, use fresh vegetable soup, as green vegetables also contain a small amount of vitamin A.</p>
<p>Vitamin B is mostly contained in the outer skin and bran of grains, and yeast is very rich in it. Other foods such as lentils, egg yolks, peas, beef, and potatoes also contain a small amount. Those who lack vitamin B will develop beriberi. If not treated quickly, the swelling can spread to the abdomen, posing a threat to life. Dutch doctor Eijkman discovered the relationship between this disease and grains. Eijkman conducted experiments on prisoners in East Indian prisons and concluded that those who eat coarse rice rarely suffer from beriberi, while those who eat white rice are very prone to beriberi. Therefore, the rice we eat should not be milled too white, as the outer layer of rice contains substances that resist this disease; at the same time, we should eat more plant leaves and beans. Vitamin B is also known as the anti-beriberi vitamin.</p>
<p>Vitamin C is mostly contained in fresh fruits and vegetables. Lemons, oranges, cabbage, tomatoes, turnips, and milk are the richest in it. Those who lack vitamin C will develop scurvy. The symptoms are sores in the stomach and intestines, subcutaneous bleeding, brittle bones, and loose teeth. Many people die from this disease; it is usually most common among sailors because there is no fresh food on ships during wartime and voyages, resulting in yellow faces, emaciation, and weakness, making them very prone to scurvy. Vitamin C is also known as the anti-scurvy vitamin.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is also known as the anti-rickets vitamin. Those who lack this vitamin will definitely suffer from rickets. If children do not receive sufficient food containing vitamin D when they are four or five years old, or even seven or eight years old, and do not see enough sunlight, they will definitely suffer from this disease. After the end of the First World War, the German people lived in poverty and lived in underground caves, never seeing the light of day all year round. Many children suffered from rickets. Later, the patients were exposed to the sunlight naked, and they gradually recovered. Those who suffer from this disease should eat more cod liver oil and milk, but sunlight contains natural vitamin D, and green vegetables also contain a small amount of vitamin D.</p>
<p>Vitamin E is mostly contained in animal muscles, wheat germ, corn, and peas. Animals lacking vitamin E will lose their reproductive function.</p>
<h3>Standards for Women's Decoration</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoge</p>
<p>Humans are full of emotions and have a strong love of beauty. Who doesn't want to decorate themselves to be beautiful and good-looking! This love of beauty is especially evident and strong in women, so even if their daily lives are very difficult, they save money and economize to decorate their beauty. Indeed, women's decoration is very appropriate, because beauty in life can make life flavorful, and decoration is the way to make people beautiful. Women are decorated well, simply like a beautiful flower, and the love between husband and wife or lovers will therefore deepen. Isn't this the happiness of life? Now, I list the principles that decoration must meet, hoping that wives and young ladies will refer to them:</p>
<p>(1) Suitable for Hygiene: Generally, many women only care about seeking beauty and neglect the hygiene of their bodies. For example, corsets and high heels are extremely unhygienic decorations, because corsets hinder lung breathing, and prevent the movement of the stomach and intestines, the impact on the body's health is really great, and how uncomfortable it is in daily life! Wearing high heels can affect the development of the feet, and have the same harm as foot binding in our country, the movement is very inconvenient, what is the difference with the shackles worn on the feet of prisoners? It is really regrettable to turn a good free person into a unfree prisoner; so decoration only takes care of beauty and makes the body suffer, then it is not worth it.</p>
<p>(2) Do Not Be Too Extravagant: We must look at the family's economic situation when decorating. It is certainly unnecessary to go into decoration while starving, but also do not be too undecorated. Families with sufficient economy can spend a little more on decoration, but it should not be too extravagant. Families with insufficient economy should try to save money on decoration, because there are other more important things to be done than decoration. Poor women must not only take care of decoration and forget this point.</p>
<p>(3) Be Artistic: The beauty of art is the real beauty, which is not vulgar and elegant, and makes people feel happy after appreciating it; the higher the level of civilization, the more artistic the decoration of their women. Therefore, the ports with convenient transportation are more artistically decorated than the remote and blocked countryside; civilized nations are more artistically decorated than barbaric nations, just look at how ugly the decorations of women of barbaric nations in movies are! The decorations are so bulky and strange. Our civilized people's decoration must be like an elegant poem, lightly depicted, and do not make it too bright, because too bright will be too vulgar and without artistic value. Therefore, clothes should be made of plain materials, short and not permed hair is the best, powder should be applied with thin lips, and Rouge should be lightly applied. In short, as long as it meets the beauty of art, you can decorate it at will, but do not make it too strange.</p>
<h3>Residence in Prevention of Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Meizi</p>
<p>Recently, the anti-tuberculosis movement has been promoted, which is indeed beneficial to the public. Therefore, I think that everyone should also pay attention to it in their own families, so as to enhance the effect of anti-tuberculosis. Now, I will write down a few points that I have thought of below, which may be slightly helpful for reference?</p>
<p>(1) Wash the Spittoons Frequently: No matter which household, there are always several spittoons, but most people are too lazy to wash them. Often, some families only wash them once a day, or even once every few days. What's more, they treat the spittoon as a garbage can, throwing all kinds of dirty things like fruit peels and grains into the spittoon for convenience. This is so harmful to hygiene; in addition, flies will be produced in the future, and the spittoon is where they breed, so washing the spittoon frequently will definitely be very beneficial.</p>
<p>(2) Empty the Garbage Frequently: The garbage swept from the room should be taken out and dumped at any time, otherwise a gust of wind will still blow it all over the ground. We can often see that some people sweep the floor and must sweep the garbage into the corner of the door, and only take it out and dump it when it has accumulated a lot. How do you know that day after day, it has become the birthplace of all poisons, so the garbage should be emptied frequently.</p>
<p>(3) Separate the Tableware: Chinese families do not separate teacups, rice bowls, chopsticks, spoons and other tableware for each person, which is not good. In fact, separation is easy, just write each person's name on their utensils to identify them. Fortunately, it is not troublesome, and everyone can promote it; besides, this is also hygienic?</p>
<p>(4) Treat Minor Illnesses Quickly: In an ordinary family, if a child has a cough, the parents are always reluctant to see a doctor immediately, thinking that it is a minor cold and does not matter. How dangerous this is! Therefore, it is always best to be anxious about the illness first, and of course it is even better to go to the hospital for a physical examination regularly.</p>
<p>In short, the residence should be washed and swept frequently, so that it is always kept clean, then it can definitely prevent the invasion of tuberculosis bacteria, and it is also important to pay attention to hygiene when eating.</p>
<h3>The Most Exquisite Train in the World</h3>
<p>— Xinfang</p>
<p>The British government has a train for the use of the royal family when traveling. Recently, because the original one was old, a new one has been completed, which can be called "the most exquisite train in the world." Now, let's introduce it.</p>
<p>Speaking of this train, the date of completion was after the outbreak of the war. The entire project was undertaken by railway experts from London and Scotland. The entire car has three sections, which are evenly distributed, one section belongs to the king, one section belongs to the queen; and the other section belongs to the two princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret. The king's section has a bedroom and a bathroom, and the arrangement of the reading room is especially exquisite. The ceilings of each room are all painted milky white. The Queen's section is everywhere mainly suitable for women to live in. These two sections are each 65 feet long. The princess's section is the simplest, with only a living room in addition to the bedroom.</p>
<p>There are several characteristics of this car worth mentioning: Generally, people have this concept that a train dedicated to the royal family should have heavy military protection, but this car is the opposite. The second point is that there are heating and cooling facilities; the temperature inside the car is not affected by the climate outside the car. The third point is that when this car stops at a certain station, it can make calls to any part of the world. The last point is that all the furniture in the car is completely silver-plated.</p>
<p>Today's King George VI usually likes to travel with the Queen. Since the outbreak of the European War, although he has been in and out of iron birds and bombs, this hobby has not diminished. Then the "most exquisite train in the world" will also follow the footsteps of the royal family and travel back and forth on the British Isles!</p>
<h3>A Week's Daily Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Hilsa herring has been on the market for many days; but it costs five or six corners per two, and it costs two or three yuan to eat such a small piece, so although I like to eat hilsa herring very much, my index finger is moving, but I still dare not ask for it, and I dare not put it on the menu. However, how can such a delicious seasonal product not have its place on the menu, so this Saturday, I will let it show its face and let people with broad economic power taste the new! There are only two ways to cook hilsa herring: steaming and braising; steaming is more fat and beautiful, and braising seems to be a little worse. However, it is best to add some ham slices to steaming, and wrap it with net oil, which costs more than braising. Let the eaters plan it themselves.</p>
<p>Monday: Mung Bean Sprouts with Shredded Pork, Sweet and Sour Yellow Croaker, Spinach with Tofu, Scallion Radish Shreds</p>
<p>Tuesday: Tomato Beef Soup, Stir-fried Silver Thread Eggs, Pickled Mustard Greens with Broad Beans, Toon Mixed with Tofu</p>
<p>Wednesday: Dried Vegetables Braised Pork, Meat Cake Stewed, Plain Oily Tofu Soup, Stir-fried Gold Flower Vegetables</p>
<p>Thursday: Onion Beef Shreds, Sweet and Sour Fried Beltfish, Scallion Broad Bean Paste, Mahjong Mixed with Artemisia</p>
<p>Friday: Minced Pork with Tofu, Gaoyou Salted Duck Eggs, Braised Vegetarian Ten Scenery, Pickled Mustard Greens with Soybean Sprouts</p>
<p>Saturday: Cabbage with Sliced Meat, Ham Steamed Hilsa Herring, Green Vegetables with Glass Noodles, Bamboo Shoots Mixed with Artemisia</p>
<p>Sunday: Braised Chicken, Stir-fried Eel, Stir-fried Broad Beans, Mixed Water Celery</p>

<h3>How Was Rice Hoarded Successfully?</h3>
<p>— Reflections</p>
<p>In a small room.</p>
<p>Premier Wang reached into his cigarette case for a "Lucky Strike". Immediately, Vice Manager Li Shaomei, who was lying on the sofa opposite him, stood up and stepped forward to light a match and hold it out to Premier Wang. Premier Wang took a puff:</p>
<p>"Indeed, Shaomei, your words are insightful. If the US and Japan really go to war, the Saigon shipping..."</p>
<p>Vice Manager Li, with a face full of pride, picked up his teacher's words and said modestly, "It's not just my insight, sir. You must have seen it long ago. The price of rice at that time can be guaranteed... So, take advantage of..."</p>
<p>"Do we still have 30,000 bags in stock now?"</p>
<p>Vice Manager Li thought for a moment and replied:</p>
<p>"Well, about 30,000 bags."</p>
<p>Premier Wang held his chin in his palm, pondered for a moment, and said:</p>
<p>"Continuing to order 10,000 bags, how many hours of food is that really enough for in Shanghai? It definitely can't be considered much! But, in terms of finances... I think, perhaps we should first have them pick through and release a batch of last year's first-half goods... Oh, no, it's okay if they don't release them. When people are desperate for food, who will care about whether it's old or not?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" Vice Manager Li gently patted his palm. "Sir, your words are absolutely right. If we release the old ones and then order new ones, wouldn't that be the same as not ordering at all?"</p>
<p>"But, in terms of fi-nan-ces." Premier Wang swiveled his majestic eyes, drawing out his words for a long time. It was indeed a difficult problem. You can't hoard goods without money, even if you know that everything will rise again. Therefore, Premier Wang also felt a little tricky. He hesitated and continued: "We've already overdrawn 500,000 from the XX Zhuang. Their foundation is small, with only 700,000 in capital. It seems embarrassing to ask again. As for the XX Bank, they mortgaged 10,000 bags to them, too... Although there are still more than ten others we deal with, we've almost maxed out our credit with them, and we don't really know them well. Either the XXX Bank has a large foundation, and I once gave them a favor, letting their runner have 1,000 bags of rice, or..."</p>
<p>Premier Wang stood up, gently patted his stomach with both hands, walked to the desk, picked up the phone, but put it down again, and said:</p>
<p>"Shaomei, please call for me. XXX, ask the Yu runner to answer the phone and ask him for 500,000 in funds."</p>
<p>Vice Manager Li connected the phone, his face beaming. After a while, he covered the receiver and said softly:</p>
<p>"Sir, he has readily agreed. Now their finances are rotten and they're suffering from having nowhere to put the money. He also said that for a rice shop like ours that makes money, let alone 600,000, they would be willing to lend 1,600,000."</p>
<p>"1,600,000? Shaomei!" Premier Wang took a step forward, his voice a little strange with excitement. "Tell him, if that's true, then agree to take his 1,600,000, for three months, the interest being no more than one point."</p>
<p>Vice Manager Li negotiated for a while and hung up the phone contentedly, saying:</p>
<p>"He has completely passed it through in front of their manager. Sir, do you mean to prepare to order 15,000 bags?"</p>
<p>Premier Wang shook his head!</p>
<p>"No, I want to order 20,000 bags. Depending on the situation, I may order 20,000 bags. Shaomei, call XX Zhuang again and see if they can move 500,000 as well?"</p>
<p>The phone was connected, but there were some hitches. Vice Manager Li covered the receiver and said softly:</p>
<p>"They have 300,000 in funds, which they are already preparing to use for a coal dust mortgage. If you want it, sir, they will refuse the other side."</p>
<p>"Agree to them."</p>
<p>"Isn't that still 200,000 short?"</p>
<p>"Shaomei, agree to them first, and the interest and term are the same as XXX."</p>
<p>Vice Manager Li hung up the phone:</p>
<p>"Sir, what about the remaining 200,000?"</p>
<p>Premier Wang replied with a smile:</p>
<p>"Third Concubine has a deposit at XX, 250,000. Transferring it out will also make her happy."</p>
<p>Premier Wang couldn't help laughing heartily, and Vice Manager Li happily laughed along.</p>

<h3>A Mother Teaches Her Child a Story</h3>
<p>— By Xing</p>
<p>Near the small vegetable market, a shrewd, listless, disheveled old woman was sitting at the entrance of a narrow alley. A large, twelve- or thirteen-year-old, skinny, bare-chested child leaned in her arms.</p>
<p>"Mom! ... I ... am very ... hungry!" He said intermittently with a crying tone. But his mother seemed not to hear him, just staring blankly at the passers-by.</p>
<p>After a moment. Suddenly his mother said to him in a soft voice:</p>
<p>"In the basket of that 'bound feet' woman over there, there are several breads, go and grab them..." The child listened, rubbed his eyes, and immediately stood up and ran and jumped towards the direction his mother pointed. As he approached the woman with the twisted "bound feet," he tiptoed and first glanced into the basket, "Oh! A bread." He said silently, saliva dripping from the corners of his mouth. He had no intention of paying attention to the things in the basket. He just used a lightning-like movement to grab two breads from the basket and run away.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to grab all four breads in the basket, but he was timid, so he only grabbed two.</p>
<p>"Ah! ... You murderer! ... Two breads ... were ... snatched away by him." The woman with the twisted "bound feet" exclaimed in fright; immediately, the eyes of many passers-by were drawn to her, but no one helped her chase the bread-snatching child. Some even showed smiles, as if watching a funny comedy.</p>
<p>He "ran away" while stuffing a bread into his mouth, eating it mouthful by mouthful. He still had one bread left to take to his mother, who had been hungry for a long time!</p>
<h3>To the Maid Agency</h3>
<p>— By Zhu Xun</p>
<p>The next morning, after receiving instructions from my mother, I had to go to the maid agency to find a maid.</p>
<p>With uneasy emotions, I walked into a shop filled with "girls" and "women," some chewing pancakes, some chatting idly. When they saw me walk in, dozens of pairs of eyes swept over me.</p>
<p>"Looking for a maid?" A plump proprietress came over to greet me. "Yes, I'm here to ask for a maid!"</p>
<p>"Listen to you pick! An older one? Or a younger one?"</p>
<p>There were tall and short, thin and fat people sitting on the stools! There were old and frail with bound feet, and there were young and well-dressed ones! I glanced at them: "There are only two people in my family, a mother and a son. I need someone who can buy groceries, wash clothes, and do rough work!"</p>
<p>"Did you hear that? Who wants to go?" The proprietress said playfully.</p>
<p>"The number of people is small, how is the salary?"</p>
<p>"People like that probably don't have any extra money! I wouldn't go just for a fixed wage!"</p>
<p>"Elder sister! Go and try it out. There are no children, no diapers to wash, and the number of people is small. You'd be a good fit."</p>
<p>After a round of deliberation among this group of unemployed people, they finally pushed out someone around forty years old. She said to me with a smile: "I'll go and try it out, okay!"</p>
<p>I happily agreed to her request, and she followed me home with her small package.</p>
<p>As soon as we arrived home, she saw my dilapidated bedroom and the dusty desk; she seemed to have suffered a great injustice. Without doing anything, she ran away immediately.</p>

<p>"The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen" Published</p>
<p>"The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen" by Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing, which was previously published in this newspaper, has now been compiled as the seventh volume of the Hawthorne Detective Pocket Series and published by the World Book Company. The book is fluent in writing and has a tight plot. The Mountain Gold Star production of the film "Gunshots in the Rainy Night" is included, with illustrations by Mr. Mu Yilong, complementing each other well. We dare to introduce it.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— By Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(8) Palpable Friendship</p>
<p>"Sorry, I'll take my leave first!" He said to the internist.</p>
<p>"He's probably going to the movies with that miss again, right?" Dr. Yan and the internist couldn't help but look at each other and smile. Everyone knew that Baldy loved to do this.</p>
<p>"Don't make fun of me!" Baldy was already walking out the door. "Be careful you get a knife in the face!" The internist stood up from the rattan chair and said humorously.</p>
<p>Just as the room was filled with laughter, the nurse surnamed Li, who had just left, rushed back, her face also showing an excited smile.</p>
<p>"Dr. Yan, this is great!" Her right hand was still holding the piece of paper. "The patient in room 17 was extremely happy when he saw this name, and repeatedly asked me to go and find him right away!..."</p>
<p>"It's a man!" The internist said cluelessly. In his mind, when a man is sick, the person he likes to see the most is always a certain woman; it must be the same when a woman is sick. Moreover, his experience as a doctor over the years seemed to confirm this ideal, so he was very surprised when he heard the nurse's words.</p>
<p>Dr. Yan didn't say anything, but took the piece of paper.</p>
<p>"Zhao Yukun, Old Danfeng Tea Garden, Xujie, Japanese Concession." He read softly. "Baldy was right, he doesn't look like an upper-class person. Okay! Go up there! Tell him we'll send someone to find him right away. Tell him to rest assured first, and we'll give him an answer sooner or later." These words were all specifically for the nurse.</p>
<p>Before the nurse could leave, the electric bell installed in the corridor outside was already ringing like thunder, pulled by Dr. Yan. (109)</p>
