<h3>來栖野村等待新命　美國立塲堅定不移　空氣似稍樂觀但結果難測　日報稱東條無意堅持要求</h3>
<p>合衆社二十日華盛頓電　此間昨對美·日關係重大問題和平解決之可能有一種愼重之樂觀情緒、該兩日本使節現方聽候東京方面關於國務鄕赫爾在近日長談中所提出各點之訓令、倘來栖·野村接到東京之答覆、或將於今日午後冉與赫爾會晤、日方及美方之消息靈通人士與華府談判有密切接觸者、對於和平解決之可能表示樂觀、惟渠等認識過去在該同一方面之努力並未成功、據稱、談話現較以前來栖水抵美時赫爾與野村大使之談話為有希望、然各方咸認為談話尙未達到可確實預測結果之地步、頃間華府對於談判之態度、由福利達省之民主黨議員潑柏氏表示稱、參院對任何「足令美國成為日本所犯任何罪孽之一份子」之條約、將予以拒絕、渠稱、倘日本願對美國和平、日本必須放棄其侵略並退出中國及越南、潑柏氏　稱、苟來栖通知華盛頓謂、一日本已感覺過去行為錯誤、決定根除其所產生之罪惡、而放棄其侵略、則彼必可獲得無限之歡迎……然苟或渠此來在於得到吾國對日本保持其贓物、或令吾國成為日本罪學之默認同謀之認可，則渠定將敗興而返」、此項聲明、似可代表華盛頓國會領袖之態度、顯示美國並未退讓其以前之立塲、其意義之更重大者、如潑柏氏之驚吿稱、「倘戰事為抵抗日本所參與之國際暴行之代價、則戰爭必將來臨」、頃間權威界稱、英國對於美·日談話、現隨時獲得報吿、</p>
<p>重慶二十日電　此間官方人士對美參議員潑柏氏所稱、如日本欲與美國維持和平、必須停止其一切侵略行為、並撤退其在中國及越南之軍隊等語、極表贊同、據云、此乃日本唯一之出路、日本苟不決定完全脫離罪惡、遵守九國公約、赫爾國務鄕之十四點及羅斯福、邱吉爾宣言、美國必不願長此絨默、至於潑柏氏之請來栖在與美政府領袖談話時、務須牢記美國決非一種姑息之脾味、此間人士認為尤足綜括日美目前之局勢云、</p>
<p>華盛頓二十日電　美參議院外委會主席康納萊稱、美政府對於遠東局勢、決不願成立一種協議而許日本在政治、軍事及經濟上有何控制中國之權　、據云、渠曾聞悉、日方欲在中國某五大城市駐軍、但此種軍隊勢將控制中國之全部、氏對中國之英勇作戰、極表敬佩、渠個人深覺唯一公允之解決辦法、厥為日軍退出中國云、</p>
<p>中英荷澳使節分訪赫爾談話</p>
<p>華盛頓十九日電　胡適大使昨日下午訪晤赫爾國務卿、此舉顯與遠東局勢發展有關、大使離國務院時、拒絕發表意見、惟神情上顯示樂觀云、</p>
<p>路透社二十日華盛頓電　英代辦坎倍爾爵士、昨晶傍晚曾訪晤美國務卿赫爾、惟曾否討論遠東局勢、則未經宣布、來栖訪問華盛頓所造成之冷淡氛圍依然存在、政府官員顯因日本各領袖在東京所發表之好戰言論頗為憤慨、赫爾與日代表咋未舉行正式會議、今日（感謝節）亦無任何約定、</p>
<p>路透社二十日華盛頓電　荷蘭駐美公使路敦、昨於美、日討論暫未進行時、往見國務卿赫爾及威爾斯、聞路敦從國務卿得悉、美當局與野村、來栖談話之性質、澳洲公使凱賽昨亦往訪國務院、</p>
<p>路透社二十日倫敦電　倫敦一般輿情以為、來栖赴美之使命、乃拖延時日之策略、但亦有人謂、在討論破裂以前、來栖所發之言論應予以聽取、而其所持之理由、應予以慎重考慮、泰晤士報華盛頓訪電稱、如日本堅持犧牲中國、則必不能成、此事極為明瞭如白畫然云、</p>
<p>合衆社二十日東京電　此間正靜候華盛頓談話之消息、日本報紙亦一致對美國採取較溫和之語氣、若干日本報紙與華盛頓消息所傳美·日談話有較樂觀之趨勢、採取巧合之論調、認為羅斯福總統與來栖特使之談判、殊有成立友好解決之强大希望、有勢力之「中外商業新聞」稱、日本準備對美國有所讓步、按該報素常代表日本財政領袖發言、包括內閣官僚之意見在內、該報云、東條首相雖「宜布其三原則、惟無意堅持日本之要求、因在外交談判中、互相讓步、實為必需也」、又言、「吾人相信、美國有重行考慮之希望、美國必須中止援助中國、作為切實之行動」、「帝都新聞」今晨宜稱、「吾人不願目覩美·日發生戰爭、吾人因信美國亦願和平、故吾人唯一之希望、厥為太平洋之平靜無事」、</p>

<p>合衆社二十日開浦鎭電　英國精銳主力艦「威爾斯王備」號、最近駛至此間作短期訪問、英首相邱吉爾適於最近發衷文吿謂、英國現時力能增强印度洋及太平洋實力、故昨日非官方人士認為、此二事有互相呼應之妙、衆人回顧海軍專家曾預言、英國或將遺派一重級主力艦由巡洋艦及驅逐艦多艘為輔、開往遠東、尤其是目前正盛稱德國已遣派精銳主力艦「透匹資號來無東、準備於美·日開戰時加入日本之艦隊云、</p>
<p>路透社二十日倫敦電　昨日英外相艾登在下院答曼德之問話、謂緬甸公路如被威脅、則民治國必採强有力之行動、渠想各有關係者皆知、緬甸公路之被攻擊、必引起嚴重局勢也云、同時日本海軍在越南之活動、亦引起注意、據負責方面云、日巡艦四艘已抵西貢、除示威對泰　重壓力外、別無日艦此種行動之理由、電聞報軍事紀者瑪克錫少將稱、縱泰國供給甚重耍之便利、然日本在陸作戰殊不沂情、緬甸公路雖非莫可侵犯之地、但此路實則在地圖上較在實際上更為動人耳、渠以為日海軍攻擊商業乃比較上容有之舉動、蓋日本或將繼續奪取根據地南至斐吉島、西至婆羅洲島、俾截斷協約國得自其領土及荷印之許多戰事供應品也、</p>
<p>海通社二十日瑞典京城電　英外相艾登昨再對日本表示敵視態度、渠在下院宜稱、進攻緬甸公路必將造成嚴重局勢、人人皆應明白知之、艾登發此言之前、議員巴堪曾鄭重指出緬甸公路對英·蘇美三國與遠東軍事局勢、在戰略上之重要關係云、</p>
<p>日艦抵越威脅泰國</p>
<p>合衆社二十日倫敦電　權威界人士昨稱、最近英國對日本海軍之活動情報、均以為日本對泰國已增强壓力、但不悉是否為聯合防禦聯盟或為合併泰國於日本東亞之「共榮區」內而出此、權威界對相傳日本巡洋艦四艘抵達西貢之事、，加以批評稱、「此舉並無特殊理由、因該處情形極為鎭靜、此舉僅屬以國旗表示彼等在該處也」、此辯解之來、由於合衆社自盤谷報吿、該區某一外交部人員極表悲觀、並稱局勢極為危險、該項宜吿與泰國兩報社評主張與日本更作密切之聯擊同時發出、並謂、日本之可能侵略為宜傳而已、盤谷人民均以為、日本軍隊之集中越南邊境為威脅泰國獨立、同時某一外交部人員稱，渠相信泰國欲保持中立、「殊不能確定」、渠稱、泰國將抵抗至「最後一人」，若遭遇任何優略時、則將通令全國一致奮起、以後則全視英美之態度矣、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社十九日河內電　日本駐越南大使芳澤、本日向美國記者發表談話稱、日本對於越南、僅欲在政治上、經濟上、文化上、促進日、越關係、捨此而外、別無其他企圖、故日本不欲在此擴張勢力、至於越南境內之日軍、至何時始能撤退、悉視中日戰爭及太平洋形勢而定、日本尊重法國在越南之主權、現在如此、今後亦然、倘有外國進攻法國殖民地、則日本當準備保衛越南、</p>
<p>英籍婦嬬不准返港</p>
<p>路透社二十日倫敦電　殖民都次官喬治霍爾、昨夜在下院答保守黨諾克斯之問話謂、遠東政局尙未許已離香港之英籍婦孺復返香港、而殖民部亦未接到在港英婦現須總撤退之報吿、至於英籍與外籍婦人入港事、則目前全視香　防務與其他公共事業之需要為轉移、諾克斯謂、英籍婦孺若干被迫從香港撤退、但留港者尙有英籍婦女九百五十人、兒童四百人及許多歐美婦孺、而混血人民與華人且多至七十五萬人、殖民部亦知此種情形否、已撒退者可於其自願時復往香港乎、如因軍事必要、不許已撤退者復返、則何為不頒布婦孺全數撤退之命令乎、諾克斯於殖民部次官答復後叉間、是否美籍婦女可許在香港登陸、喬治霍爾答稱、渠不能言美籍婦女是否仍許在港登陸、惟美政府已勸美籍婦女離境、並允供給船隻便其離港云、</p>
<p>路透社二十日東京電　日本廣知時報今日敦促英國撤退一切在香港之軍隊、包括最近抵達該處之加拿大軍、因日本具有可以信賴之和平決心、願維持香港之完整也、該報向來反映外交部之意見、據稱、加拿大軍隊之抵達、叉為一無理由之挑撥、對其孤立地位並不能增强抵禦、而使香港更趨安定也、叉稱、「最好英國能撤退一切香港之駐軍、而信賴日本之和平居心」云、</p>

<h3>英軍進攻里比亞</h3>
<p>北非英軍，自十八日起，已開始對里比亞作猛烈之進攻，並獲迅速之進展，猶憶本月六日，蘇聯國防委員會主席斯達林氏曾在莫斯科十月革命紀念會中，發表演說，謂「紅軍之所以暫時遭遇逆境，係由於歐洲方面缺乏對希特勒之第二戰綫；苟歐陸能建成第二戰綫，則紅軍地位必可轉佳而對德不利，吾人深信此點在最近將來必可成為事實。」同時英國議會及一般民意，亦多贊成建立新的戰塲，一面援助蘇聯，一面打擊德國；英政府對此，因事涉軍機，雖屬避免作公開之答覆，然以戰略家著聞之英相邱吉爾氏，當然充分認識此點之重要，而積極布置，以促其實現。昨報載路透社倫敦電稱，英當局正大舉刷新陸軍陣容，其高級統帥，將有重要之更動，卽現任內國軍總司令白魯克將軍，將繼狄爾將軍任英帝國軍參謀主任：東南指揮部總指揮巴蓋特中將，將繼任內國軍總司令：而狄爾將軍則將出任印度孟買省長。據路透社軍事訪員觀察，以為此次變更，為英國將以更積極形式從事陸地戰爭之先聲，然則北非攻勢之展開，殆正英軍增闢第二戰綫，大舉發動陸上反攻之序幕。</p>
<p>我人試一檢討英國之戰鬥力，自以海軍為其骨幹，然近年來整軍經武之結果，英人陸空軍力，亦大有可觀，而空軍尤質量並進，屢揚威於歐陸。英國茍增闢對德陸地戰塲，固必以陸軍配合空軍為交戰之主力，然為充分發揮本身優點，自當出動海軍，以海陸之協同，作攻勢之進擊。適合此一條件，可供英軍登陸作戰之戰塲，其在西歐，為挪威，為法國西岸；其在南歐，為義大利，為巴爾幹；其在北非，則為里比亞。而挪威僻處西北，不足為戰局重心；法國淪陷區及義大利巴爾幹諸地，雖饑寒交迫，民怨沸騰，究因交通便利之故，與德國本部為混然之連合體，德國援師，可以朝發而夕達，英軍渡海來攻，於勢有所不利。而里比亞則不然。里比亞為義大利屬地，今由德義聯防，其實際作戰指揮權，自墨索里尼數度「肅軍」後，已全入德人之手。然德人以客籍之將校，握發號施令之大權，終未能齊一軍心，戰鬥精神，因而大减。且德義之於里比亞，有地中海阻隔其間，而地中海之制海權，至今操於英國。軸心方面之兵員與戰具，雖非不能偷渡以抵北非，其間究冒甚大之危險，隨時可被英巡邏艦擊沉或捕獲。加之埃及為英之軍事同盟國，其作戰根據地與英共之，而自阿比西尼亞義軍總司令奧斯泰公爵於今年五月二十日向英國乞降後，整個東非及紅海區域，已全歸英軍控制。故西歐大陸上之戰略形勢，軸心國家以逸待勞，而北非戰略形勢，則以英國為其主體。然則英軍於此發動反攻，實居一種有利地位。去冬及今春，當華維爾將軍駐節開羅之日，亦曾對里比亞作試探進攻。其時德義對蘇猶未揭開戰幕。得以較多之力量，應付英軍之攻勢。至於今日，蘇聯方以全力與德軍精銳鏖戰於東歐，德國決無充分之餘力可以他顧，故北非英軍此度配合地中海英艦隊，大舉西攻，當可得更多之收穫，建立永久之戰果。</p>
<p>適在此時，而外電傳來，法國駐非洲總督魏剛將軍，突被維希政府免職。魏剛將軍自去年法國敗戰後，卽出駐非洲，統率一部分之武力，對維希為有力之支持；貝當對德國，有時猶能相當强硬應付，魏剛與有力焉，其突被免職，與此當不無關係，而德國之覬覦非洲法國屬地，不斷對法增加壓力，亦可於此徵之。蓋法屬北非洲在軍事上及經濟上均具重要性，其對於西地中海猶埃及之於東地中海；而法屬西非洲則一面為向南美洲發展勢力之跳板，一面足以控制南大西洋。德人之欲得此而甘心，自在意中。同時德國對土耳其及西班牙，最近亦頗有所企圖。凡此諸端，益增北非英軍此度發動攻勢之重要性。蓋目前里比亞為軸心國家在非洲唯一之中心根據地，苟能一舉加以肅淸，則不特可以鞏固英國對非洲之控制權，並消滅德國在非洲擴展勢力之企圖，卽聯繫英蘇之地中海交通綫，亦將因此而更確保其安全，以為將來作更進一步的軍事發展之基礎也。</p>
<h3>尼羅河畔協約軍　在北非展開攻勢　深入里比亞境五十哩　英海空軍亦出動助戰</h3>

<p>學着老縴手的步伐，在紅沙灘上安閒的走，忽然縴纜將我們帶到鵝卵石灘上。太陽光下鵝卵石的灼熱，觸到每個新縴手柔嫩的脚板上，發出一陣呼痛聲。手裏的重量阻止我們逃避這種痛苦，水邊的潮濕又使我們不忍穿套乾潔的布鞋。於是「草鞋，草鞋，到犍為辦草鞋！」老縴手的提出，變成新縴手的決定。可是老縴們並沒有一個着草鞋的。</p>
<p>終乎被縴纜拉進水裹，「啊，好安逸」！水被太陽蒸晒得溫暖的，脚踏在平滑的鵝卵石上，爽適而有凉意。沉重的脚步攪亂了水裏的淸靜，驚散了魚囝的聚會！這樣的水邊給予我們帶雅氣的新縴手極大的引誘。有些竟在船過急流卸責之後，大要捉魚囝的遊戲。</p>
<p>船在打彎的石灘上擱淺了。兩位穿着長衫的老縴手走下河，慢慢的將船送進深水裏去。在水中工作的時候，他們將長衫捲到腰部，看出沒有穿褲子。上岸之後，搖身一變，又恢復斯文的樣子。這時躺在草地上等待船行的我，對此頗感興趣。可是縱目遠看，河的上流站着一位重載本船的水裹工作者，水已達到胸部，他索性將長衫晚下，當為頭巾，圍在頭上。有人說：「川人眞斯文，連勞動者的身上都常常披着一襲長衫」。不過船夫們為了禮貌，為了工作便利，不得不如此。如果　到荒凉險峭的地段，便可以看到一批批裸體縴手拉着無女客的貨船。恍若置身於十年前宣傳極盛一時的德國健康營裏！</p>
<p>過了犍為，常常越過山坡和港汶。走上一座丘陵，船夫便要求派一人「斷後」，照顧縴纜，以免牽掛在樹枝或岩石上妨碍前進。這是一種很苦的工作；有時要越過不必經過的尖頂，有時要爬上突出江岸的大岩石，有時落得很後，有時前進很快。所以常常換人輪値，甚或兩人同時工作，倘若遇到最繁重最危險的關頭，便得船夫親自出馬了。</p>
<p>到達汶河或是不適宜揹牽的地方，便得一齊上船飄過河去。在一個懸崖絕壁聚夾着兩岸的地段，我們這隻吃水頗淺的小木船，沿崖脚划行，同時用竹篙　在平直的山崖上一個個圓錐形　裏撐過——這些硐是千百年來若干船夫辛勞的結晶。「人工偉大」，我們不費力的循得前人的遺跡前進，不期然的這樣讚嘆着。</p>
<p>這時一隻重載船在中流上駛，站在船梢高架的木板上的舵工，一面掌舵，一面敲着小鼓，和着十二把木漿聲跟十二位船夫合唱的「啊呵」聲。船到急流，划手全體轉身向艙出死力的反扳漿。鼓聲急了，漿聲急了，「啊呵」聲也急了，同時還傳出一陣陣的脚踏甲板聲。穿過夾谷，一切聲響停止，划手們陸續跳下水去，走上縴路背縴。</p>

<p>防軍會議　即將舉行</p>
<p>美海軍第四聯隊撤退在即、關於其所遺C區接防問題、工部局昨日（十九日）曾開會討論、但未有決定、據悉、工部局對於C區接防問題、決聽取各國防軍司令會議之最後決定、且已將此意、通知該會秘書、記者今晨詢諸該會委員之一、雖稱開會日期尙無確定、但謂大概不久即將舉行、該會委員、為美日義駐軍司令萬國商團司令、及工部局警務處長、外傳美海軍一部、有乘美撤僑專輪兩艘先行離滬說、據該聯隊司令霍華德上校表示、即係事實、亦不足為異、但美總統輪船公司對美撤僑專輪於週六（二十二日）即行離滬說、則巳否認、據稱、該輪將留滬較久、</p>

<p>國米限價亦將實行</p>
<p>工部局食米管理委員會鑒於國米去路、亦不遜於洋米、若不予限價、則影響民食前途、當匪淺鮮、爰經長時間之磋商、對於國米售價、將予加以限制、今所有辦法業經次第議妥、一俟與米業各委員會晤洽商後、即可付諸實施、昨據米業各委員表示、對於食米管理委員會之設法評訂國米標準售價、均甚贊同、故本巿整個民食、嗣後將益趨穩定、其登記棧存洋米六十五萬餘包、昨據米號業公會消息、該會現據會員同業報吿、以各該米號前所辦進洋米而尙未出棧者、亦均已登記、但於門市需貨準備出棧時工部局則不予　給搬運許可證、要求救濟云云、該會刻已在辦理登記、俾向當局提出交涉、</p>

<h3>螢光燈之裝置及（續）　電力公司管理章程</h3>
<p>— 汪經鎔</p>
<p>根據上述舉例，交易中之最為公道者，當為購買之數量等於送達之數量，即購買之數量與送達之數量，應為一百與一百之比，若果此比例較低，即屬不正常，不公允者，此項比例，在商業上名之日，「商品比例」或稱「商品因數」，而在電學上，則電器用具實在所消耗之電量，與發電機為之而輸供之電量之比例，稱為「電力因數」。</p>
<p>通常任何商品尠有以低「商品因數」出售者，換言之，即不以「多送少購」之方式出售，吾人從未今日購炭兩籮，而明日退回其一籮，他日再購數籮，而又退回其一部份，至於購買汽油，或煤氣時，亦不出以此種方式，通常吾人對於電流之購用，亦何獨不然，惟有多種電氣用具，如螢光燈者，具有一種天然之特性，當其接於五十週波之交流電時，無論吾人覺察與否，一對電綫，在每百分之一秒時間內輸送「一包」電力，而此種電具，僅用其一部份，而退還其餘不必之一部份，此種電具可稱為電力之「試用主顧」，因此電力公司之發電機構與饋電機構，因電流退回之頻繁，而增加非必要之工作，正與地毯店因地毯之退回，而支付無謂之車資與人工無異，更有進者，地毯之式類繁多，大小不一，「多送少購」之制度，有時尙為事理所容許，惟電力公司所輸供之電力，品質既無軒輊，式樣亦無分別，故其計算電價時，並未將此項無用之服務費加入計算之事實，亦無將此項無用之服務費加入計算之理由，假如螢光燈之用戶，竟得享受此「多送少購」（即低電力因數）之權則結果將使電力公司之費用，普遍增加，於是影響於一般之電費價率，即不用螢光燈之用戶，亦將受其連累，此又為一不正常，不公尤之情事，當為公正之用戶，所不取者也，幸而此低電力因數之弊病，並非不可救藥之絕症，祗須採用一種名為儲電器，Capieltor或Condenser者，即可校正之，非特此也，儲電器之效用，不獨可以刪除無謂之消耗，且可促進用戶之經濟効率，其對於用戶之利益不祗一端，茲分條縷述於後，　用戶於改裝螢光燈時，設該燈之「電力因數」巳經由儲電器加以校正者，則其所加於電綫之負荷較少，不必更換原來電綫，即可裝置較多之燈盞，得較足之光量，若在新裝置中裝配同數之燈，可用較細之電綫，　高電力因數之裝置，能將用戶綫路上之電流量减低，因此改善燈盞之電壓，而增進燈盞之功能，　路綫上電流之减低可以减少路後之電耗損失，幷减省電費，　二十瓦及四十瓦之燈盞、裝用高雷力因數之「雙燈」輔助器者，較之裝置其他任何式樣之設備，每度電力，發出更多之光量。（完）</p>

<h3>紗市場只管鬥法　漲漲跌跌　還有甚麼意義</h3>
<p>昨日紗山猛進疾退、形勢汹汹、竟在怒濤駭浪之中、始升一百六十元、宜吿漲停板、旋後謠言紛紜、浮多一致出籠、一霎間突然狂落二百元、及斯暴升暴降、其中盈利固有、然大都虧耗者居多數也、據云有一紗號業已擱淺、二十支雙馬最高峯價逼近三千元、低價暗盤最低做至二千七百九十元、午後紗市因上午漲至一千九百五十元、宜吿漲停板，交換所為追收證金起見、市塲暫行停止交易、今日再照常營業、惟取引所開拍、紗布均見鬆落一步、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開因上日收盤情形緊張、首盤即跳九十元為一千八百八十元、然此盤一開、市塲形勢汹汹、少頃微跌至　千八百五十元、繼後聞取引所開盤紗布一致猛跳百元以外、市塲頓見狂奔、直上至二千五百五十元、宣吿漲停板、然塲外最高峯做至二千九百九十元至三千元、豈料三收盤、取引所忽然下落、為消息利空、浮多羣爭出龍、暗盤一瀉至二千七百九十元、査半日間成交統計一千四百包、</p>
<p>金雙馬期貨市況、由　漲　下、後又　起回風、當晨初開出市態先頗挺俏、十一月份首盤為二七〇〇元、續升八十元、十二月為二八三〇元、軋好六十元、形勢仍見平定、散空扒補殷切、加以買方堅定、前兩月期均先續升、入後以謠傳國際間談判暫時休止、人心遂起浮盪、多頭無力支持、復又出籠、故一月期開出巳降低三十元、為一八四〇元、入後相繼　下、殊無特色、午後因廠單上午漲停板後、暗盤下傾頗巨、人心　呈恐慌、大戶與散戶爭相拋出、檯面賣氣旺盛、各月期相繼而下、十一月期曾低至二四八〇元、十二月期降達二六一〇元、一月期亦一度小至二七四〇元、雖入後略為回昂、但結果近期回小八十元、十二月跌落一百元、一月期亦小一百十元、茲列表於後、</p>

<h3>現棉觀望</h3>
<p>現棉情況、上午因紗市狂　、喊價頗昂、近午因國際風雲紊亂、紗價又復慘落、大衆錢望、致交易又全停頓矣、巴西　二〇件　二三〇·〇　號家又　一五〇件　一二〇·〇　又蘭宮　一〇〇件　六四四·〇　又又　一〇〇件　六　　·〇　又又　一〇〇件　六二五·〇　又又　一〇〇件　六二〇·〇　又</p>
<p>紐約棉巿、市况不定、而有參次、先因同業買進、及現貨商買進而漲、繼之又因一部分甫方幫套賣及多頭了結而跌、及至最後市况、再因空頭抵補及同業買進略漲、故昨日收盤價格較上日約漲二至十二磅因不等、</p>
<p>印度棉市先因現貨商售出而跌、但續後又因空頭抵補及歐州出口商買進而回漲、收盤價格漲跌一二羅比不等、又預測今日開盤市况看小〇·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>棉布終於銳落</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市晨開暴漲、不旋踵又告銳落、午後漸轉穩定、十六磅花蝶粗布高峯達一百十四元半、較上日狂跳近十元、午後先回降至九十九元、收市上升達一百〇一元難買、結果白貨粗細布一部份跌每疋二元至四元、漂染布平平、怡和廠開出金三塔漂布二百箱、價一百十元、本街成交各布六百餘件、客銷以淪陷區採購較殷、</p>
<p>東布　初因紗價猛騰、漲風續厲、繼以謠言利空、直綫狂瀉、人心恍惚、無從捉摸、已入混亂局面中、取引所彩球標布晨開漲八九元、下午開盤較前日反跌三元外、收盤回升一二元、結果本月份九十一元，跌三元半、十二月九十四元半、跌一元半、一月份九十七元與上日無變動、而現貨市塲晚收時則一致下降、龍頭細布廠單為九十九元五角、　四君子嗶嘰三元六角二分半、</p>
<h3>黑匯劃帳　又有通融之訉</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、中央及滙豐兩掛牌未更、滙豐等行小櫃檯價均平、英美滙黑黑市稍有開展、聞本市之劃滙外商銀行有少數肯通融劃賬訊、惟手續費極巨、華商所餘多頭美滙二辦士二五及美滙三元三七五求售、乏人顧問、市勢大見鬆賤、乃進口絕跡、洋行毫無需要也、價比上兩日、英長二五、美長三七五、據未證實傳說、進口洋行會結進美滙為三元七五、至在美國內兩外商進出口之劃滙仍少買戶云、</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊又隨現金價下落二十元、英金票仍無變動、美金票於上午曾高至三十四元三角、但旋即步落、最後為三十三元、比上日軋跌四角、香港票趨勢尙堅、晚市高至七元四角、日金票及朝鮮票均稍趨疲、前者退為三元三角、後者降至三元二角、</p>
<p>香港二十日（週四）電、今晨匯市開盤呆滯異常、各滙仍無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津二十日（週四）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、倫敦及紐約雷匯仍無榮辱、有行無市、申匯降五角為七十五元、聯鈔暗盤昂五角、為四十六元、</p>
<h3>金價劇跌　逼近一萬八千元關</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗巿、先漲後突劇跌、已回入一萬九千元大關內、一度竟會跌至一萬八千元關口、各方人心由堅驟轉疲、乃於十時左右、忽傳美日談判日本軟化、引起某種空氣、故雖見銀行幫傾進力抬、大豐全日又軋進七百七十兩、明豐軋進五百八十兩、但客幫傾售祥、興永出四百九十兩、祥和·順源·德成各出二百餘兩、賣勢由弱轉强、致價抬至一萬九千九百五十元、即起反動狂落、下午退見一萬八千零五十元低價、起一千九百元跌風、故有見低買戶活動、曾哄起八百五十元、終以人心向下、價復挫落、收市軋小一千一百八十元、全日交易共一萬六千一百四十兩、飾金盤小一百十元、為一千八百七十元、</p>
<p>現金漲後急流狂退</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初承上日漲勢帶堅、九點開巿已升至一萬九千七百元、比上日收價高一百七十元、忽見天元·時和·中興來售、退小至一萬九千五百五十元、德孚·大豐·明豐·德成爭進力抬、價遂步漲四百元、十點未到哄達一萬九千九百五十元、利　傳說忽起、買戶湧集、祥興永·祥和·德成·順源·時和·永成·天元·義豐猛烈吐售、市價急流狂退、入一萬九千元內、步降一千五百五十元、見一萬八千四百元低價、午收一萬八千四百五十元、下午二點開市即低五十元、計一萬八千四百元、德孚·永成·德大·德成力售，續見撳小三百五十元、降至一萬八千零五十元、不意明豐·大豐·祥和·合盛爭先猛進、立起回風，步漲六百五十元、哄至一萬八千七百元、終見義豐·祥興永·天元售出、復挫、四點收市一萬八千三百五十元、比上日狂跌一千一百八十元、有一千九百元高低、金號本牌金、門市售價一萬八千五百元、收進减一千元、</p>
<p>飾金變動八次之多</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行及新同行初掛升四十元、為二千零二十元、後步小四次、低一百四十元、為一千八百八十元、下午初續跌至一千八百五十元、後回上至一千九百元、最後一千八百七十元、一日變更八次之多、軋小一百十元、收進减一百五十元、紋銀仍二十六元，黑巿二十三元云、</p>
<h3>公積坐觀風色　外股盤旋而下</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市忽變動甚速、上午猛跌一元餘、午後忽漲一元餘、其跌落之原因、大都日美談判聞有停頓之說、市塲多頭太多、遂吿大跌、午後生力軍多頭、忽起大抬、丙種忽又穿出七十元關、此種人為的做法，究不能支持長久、故收盤仍在關內收盤、總之目下在美日談判毫無消息透露之前、看漲看跌、均未可厚非，所以稍一抬價、一般盲從者最易受其惑、反之亦然、故此時市價實未上正軌、至本埠謠言則尙未息、但亦未能證實、在此恍惚不寗之際、殊難下平、因難逆料將來之漲跌也、昨上午同益繼續買進、同康亦有進胃、丙種初傲九元四五角、嗣以久豐同順鼎康潤德生大等愈　愈湧、巿况遂吿不支破入九元、後見八元四角小價、午收稍回、形勢漸趨不振、午後同益復有進胃、丙種開盤驟衝出七十元關、而以零一角開盤、一時市塲盲從者、以為必有良好消息、乃紛紛買進、大通鴻大潤德均有買進、但同順久豐仍一貫賣出、聯和怡泰亦皆求售、丙種七十元、終未能站定、巿價結果除丁種略小五分，外餘則好五分一角至四角不等、成交約二百五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日統甲七六·六〇　七五·〇〇七六·三〇漲〇·四〇統乙七二·〇〇　七〇　七〇七一·四五又〇·〇五統丙七〇·三〇　六八·四〇六九·九〇又〇·一五統丁六五·六〇　六四·八〇六五·五〇跌〇·〇五統戊六九·四〇　八七·八〇六九·三〇漲〇·〇五</p>

<p>衆業股市仍寗靜、價格升降靡定、晨開堅挺殊甚、怡和紗廠鋼業等俱漲三四元，經過一度穩定後、市况終又盤下、祇鋼業股仍站住於高價邊緣、其餘收價與隔昨無大軒輊、</p>
<h3>米市停頓無礙　洋粉亦然無市</h3>
<p>米昨洋米仍在停頓中、即國米亦復到消兩乏、今後洋米市面或將無形中止、如是則可减少投機囤積者操縱矣、至於民食方面、雖國米不足恃、然以工部局港米得外滙加增而添加、且有棧貨六十五萬包之平價收歸公賣、勢必再度减低、公賣價格、使全市民得到救濟之實益也、</p>
<p>粉亦復無形停頓、美坎粉完全無市、緣前日雜糧公會第一天恢復下午集會後、一般久靜思之皮球份子又復從事活動、貨方扳俏、盲從奮起、市價一漲二三元、在洋米方始抑平、平粉不久實現之際、客運中阻、實消極微、粉市似宜吿一定局、乃一經投機囤買、市面立見反常飛騰、宜其為各方所注視也、昨投機略為斂跡、執貨者亦乏售出、惟大戶以平粉未到、依然看好、故市外配價難鬆、金龍銀行棧乃有四十二三元喊聲發現、小麥無巿、麩皮小包漲到五十六元、蘭花客麩五十四元開出後、進戶觀望、後市亦復趨疲云、</p>
<h3>雜糧油豆略平</h3>
<p>昨日食油投機交易稍見减少、巿價已轉平定、黃豆則以本街去化略暢、貨主扳售而昂二三元、苞米始升繼回、結果現貨尙平、期貨軋升二三元、統市售開靑島生油二十桶、大連豆油三十桶、大有廠淸油二百担、又菜油一百担、日華廠菜油一百桶、川南廠菜油一百担、天津陳金元二百包、又新金元六百包、又新靑豆三百包、靑口及歸德黃豆五百包、苞米現貨二千包、期貨四百噸、</p>
<h3>期糖交割停市　現貨交易清寂</h3>
<p>昨糖市以聯營公司從事交割、期貨暫停、致交易淸寂、現貨划盤升沉互見、如二四粗白十月與十一月間初開二百七十二元至七十五元、下午仍為二百七十二元、比前僅小三角許、勢頗平穩、太B嘜為二百四十四元至四十七元、好起二十二元、DY嘜二百二十八元、升八元HX嘜二百念五元　至念二元、結果比升二元、港粗二百三十元、則小去二元、荷赤二百十元至十三元、最後為零八元、較升三元、總計全日成交僅三千餘包而已、</p>
<h3>湖蓮後市防斷</h3>
<p>湖蓮到源久乏、底存經陸續售通、惟最近到有四十件、其貨身色並佳、聞為寳昌行如數開進、成價為二百九十元、但劃之成本、業已倒懸、故以後恐將斷檔云、</p>
<h3>五金市況徘徊</h3>
<p>五金頗現徘徊狀態、行情過高、銷路呆滯、惟海外來源不繼、加以本埠存底究屬有限、故行盤米見下落、黑鐵坯子當亦無從例外、昨仍徘徊於一萬元左右一捆、</p>
<p>二百磅美會司鐵、因來路早斷、刻市所能應巿者、僅木街存貨、亦且日薄、不易大批購納、標準行情殊覺挺秀、昨每箱沽開一千三百五十元許、</p>

<h3>請注意市民的居住</h3>
<p>— 霂長</p>
<p>自工部局管理物價以來，一切情形都稱良好，市民受惠匪淺，在物價高漲的威脅下，稍稍能透轉一股氣。工部局總董李德爾說得好：「平準會對於以主要物品供應上海，巳表示同情的重視，故公衆方面儘可安心，……平準會對奢侈品之外匯，不擬供給，但工部局自信該會對本埠中外居民生活所必需之各項物品，當能供給外滙。」第一批物品限價已經公布，第二批即於下週公布，巿民們為生活的迫急需要，正在深切的期望着。一般人們對於奢侈品久巳不發生聯繫，他們所需耍的，還是生活上最起碼而不可或缺的。</p>
<p>當局對於糧食首先下其巨槌；以後次第不斷限價必需品，其步驟可為扼要。夫衣食住行，乃人生之必需，食尤為重要，而住亦同處主耍地位。故在此塲合，提出上海嚴重的居住問題以求合理解決，當不嫌其辭費。</p>
<p>市民們吃這「住」的苦頭，已由來久矣深矣，可謂言之痛心。二房東大房東當路，做三房客的正是最苦惱的被壓榨者。本刋日前發表他們的呼聲，要不以為悽慘，嚴重，這人就是個超人。</p>
<p>自己有上幾幢房屋，便可和國米囤一切貨品一樣，利之所在，不惜用種種方法，在房客頭上窮刮。物價因受限制而跌降，惟有房租却扶搖直上，一帆風順，四成後再是五成，倒是幾何級數推進。祗要一紙或口頭通知，房客祗好唯唯聽從。更有種種「分宅出售」「合同期滿」「產權轉移」「外匯結算」的把戲，務使人其彀中。二房東更順水推舟，變本加厲，人家加五成房租，他就加六七成，水電費又得外加，狐假虎威，坐享其利，莫斯為甚。當然，其中並非都是烏鴉，但有正當理由按照比例推算分攤能有幾人？而且為了「必要」，二房東太太，又是雌老虎，好不好都要哭笑俱全受其管轄，走在她簷下，大有不得不低頭之概。在亭子間內，灶披間裏，叫層擱中的房客們為息事寗人計，大都忍氣呑聲，於是房東們勢燄更張大了。</p>
<p>年前，國軍駐在時，對於租賃房屋會有廢止小租，限制房租之舉，以利民生；戰後，租界當局亦曾有租賃章程草案的發表，以殺兇燄；惜後者議而不行，未有影響。近頃改低電費，地捐原是好現象，但於房東們却是個「坐呑」的好機會，三房客不曾有什麽受惠</p>
<p>「卑宮室而盡力乎溝洫」「德不孤，必有鄰」，吾願租界當局對市民的居住問題與隄制日用品價同樣有嚴正的表示，則受惠者豈獨二三人而已。</p>
<h3>解決上海嚴重的居住問題　盼迅組「房租評價委員會」</h3>
<p>— 一市民</p>
<p>戰前一幢房屋，向大房東租來，房屋大一點，約四五十元，微小一點，約二三十元。現在大房東向二房東加房租，恐不能如二房東對於三房客那樣，歷次加租，統計起來，也不得超過戰前一倍。現在二房東呢，以數十元一幢房屋，分租給三房客，可以得到十數倍乃至二十倍以上的房金。本身的住屋，還不化一點房租。目前二房東的慾望，與日俱增，什麼大房東加租啦，自來水加價啦，電費加風啦，…一切的一切，逢三推五，藉漲價之名，而實行其變相的加租是實。—因為並不照加價與消費來比例—</p>
<p>兩租界鑒於物價之飛漲，有限制物價之舉，而平售洋米，尤嘉惠平民不少，對市儈得到許多制裁的效果。不過這有形的巿儈，容易為當局所察覺，二房東的毒燄，深深地潛伏在每個角落裏，百分之九十以上，都感受到他的痛苦！現在我們發出微弱的呼聲，預期得到最大的效果，呼籲兩租界常局，共同起來制裁這無形的房儈。（編者按：法租界當局在以前曾發表租賃章程草案，後未實行。）</p>
<p>近頃旅滬西僑，曾有對付大房東加租的建議，甚至有一部份華人，建議三房客聯合會的組織，但都沒有切實的表現。現在，我們要求兩租界當局，解除數百萬巿民倒懸之厄，迅速成立「非常時期房租評價委員會」，性質是臨時的，最後的執行機關，仍然屬諸法院、</p>
<p>關於「非常時期房租評價委員會」的實體，是以二房東對於分租的收益，不得超過本身代價的一倍以上。（並且包括本身住宅比例算入）（編者按：此項提議，已極溫和。）關於該會的程序是不吿不理；以命令處置一切，並請法院强制執行。舉辦房屋調査，不得使有用之房屋，因减租而空閒居奇，强迫其出租。三房客如向該會申訴减租或制止加租制止遷讓之理由後，立即調査，公平評議後，如不服處置，送請法院强制執行。大房東欲加房租者，亦須經評價會之批准。</p>
<p>以上的辦法，不過是一個原則而已。至於詳細的有利於三房客的，合法的規定法律方面習慣方面及事實方面—還希望當局接受予以採納施行，對於目前上海最嚴　的住的問題，一定能達到我們預期解決之目的。—我們大家都在馨香的禱祝着。（却酬）</p>
<h3>嬰孩和學步小孩　應該怎樣避免肺癆</h3>
<p>— 滌淸</p>
<p>衣服除保護體溫外，宜盡可能地輕鬆。過於護暖的棉毛絨，法闌絨這一類，並不足貴的，因為這些衣服足以妨礙孩子的呼吸機能。</p>
<p>餵乳　在孩子初生的幾個月裹，由健康的母親授乳，是最重要而有益的。倘若母親患着肺病，便不適宜於授乳，為避免母親的咳嗽唾沫傳染起見，自然以雇用健康奶娘為適當</p>
<p>哺乳期的孩子，牛乳或者奶粉之類的食品，應常是每天的主要食料。漸漸並進而給以米糊食品或其他。　還須要準時欽以橘汁，每日少量的魚肝油，都能增强他抵抗病菌的力</p>
<p>小孩每每不喜歡吃蔬菜，這是很可惜的。因為新鮮蔬菜，蒿苣等等及紅蘿葡蕪　等裏面含着極有價值的保護原質。尤以佳美的水果與蔬菜混和的食品，最為有益。每日一品脫的牛乳，也是不可少的。不過必須經過肺病檢查或淸濾消毒過的，方能常飲。由淸潔牛乳中製成的白搭，乳酪，奶餅之類，也是極其有益的。</p>
<p>傳染病如痧子，百日咳之類發生時，必須予兒童以嚴格的體格檢查。有人時常說：「痧子見小孩所不能免的。最好在他入學以前出過就好了。」這是大大的錯誤。稍長年齡的兒童出着痧子，其嚴重性質實比嬰兒期為輕。所以吾們應當盡力保護小孩避免此種疾病的傳染。旣患着此種病症後，當盡力注意看護。因為在痧子漸漸痊愈的時期，最有肺癆開始的危險。</p>
<p>入學以後　現在的小孩大多從小便進幼稚園，甚至在不滿五足歲的孩子，便進幼稚班了。幼稚班常常是露天的，而且每天有着長時期的休息。</p>
<p>在這個時期，或者送他進福兒診療所，那醫生會得吿訴你這小孩營養上所當特別注意之點，飲食上穿衣上與任何特別困難之點。這種機會，可以充分明瞭，學步小孩怎樣會得到毛病，怎樣纔可以期其速愈而不枉費時日。</p>
<p>小孩肺癆的嚴重情形，較稍長年齡的兒童為低，可是病菌便在此時潛伏。最好是及早予以檢騐，由醫師的診斷而及早予以防範或療治。</p>
<p>若是有特別不良健康的癥象，當然要請醫生，或者到福兒所去檢騐。頸核增大，發熱，面色蒼白，或是食慾不振，都暗示着應該給予特別檢査，切勿大意輕忽。（完）</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十四　打英雄的生活</p>
<p>「瞧你這模樣也眞可憐，不過今晚太不凑巧，巳有兩個人吿了假，你要休息也祇能等到明天了！」他一面打牆上取下一頂呢帽來，向自己頭上套去，一面又特別找上了一句好話。「旣然這樣，回頭翻扒虎船的時候，你別上去就是啦！」</p>
<p>這當然已算得是天大的恩典了。</p>
<p>秋海棠一面連連的點頭，一面却又禁不住咳嗆大作起來。</p>
<p>這幾天，他自己也不知道是什麽緣故，天又不冷，晚上又不會受過寒，忽然平日咳起嗽來；而且咳得很兇，晚上從戲院子裏回去，頭方靠到枕上，喉嚨裹氣便不順了，至少要咳半個多鐘頭，才能勉强睡熟。但睡到早上八九點鐘，又得給肺支管裏悶着的那股濁氣鬧醒了，使他嗆得在床上躺不住，無論精神是怎樣的疲倦，也不能掙扎着爬起來。</p>
<p>「爸爸，還是找個大夫瞧瞧吧！」梅寳已不知道對他說過幾次了。而且還聽着別的同居的人的指導，給她父親做過幾次杏酪湯和冰糖燉生梨一類的止咳藥物，只是秋海棠吃了下去，並沒有發生作用。（二六八）</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>影戲的祖宗</h3>
<p>— 之瑜</p>
<p>無可否認的，影戲在二十世紀的游藝界裏要算最最發達的一種戲劇了。人們大概都知道這是十足道地外國人所發明的吧！但那裹曉得在我國北宋的時候，巳經有了影戲。（見南宋孟元老所著的東京夢華錄，吳自牧所作的夢梁錄。）</p>
<p>老據家顧頡剛先生曾寫過澳州影戲一文，蔣大年先生也想寫一部長橋影戲的書，他們都很想把中國固有的藝術文化發揚而光大之；我不敢有怎樣的夢想，我祇想把我們古時候的影戲——也可說是影戲的祖宗——的一些有趣的玩意兒寫些出來，給喜歡硏究影戲的人們參考參考而巳。</p>
<p>西洋人說影戲是從走馬燈演變而成的，這句話倒不是沒有理由，我們古時候的影戲就是應用着走馬燈的原理而發明的。</p>
<p>古影戲最主要的部份是一張驢子的皮，這張驢皮要磨得極薄，幾乎薄得透明，在皮的上面畫着人呀！馬呀！狗呀…，這就算是底片了。皮的背後點着很亮很亮的油盞——雖然比不上現在的幾千支光的電燈，但也和一百支光的相彷彿。距離驢皮之前約莫丈餘的地方，掛着一幅白色的布幕，這就是所謂銀幕了。這樣，驢皮上的畫就會映到白色的布幕上去，驢皮可以移動，那幕上的像也就動了起來。這似乎和現代的卡通片子差不多；眞的，簡直是一樣！</p>
<p>而且，這種影戲還是有聲的呢，原來有一個叫做司唱的，他在布幕的旁邊，依着戲裏的人物（生·旦·凈·丑·）表情或唱或白。</p>
<p>你若以為我所說的太荒唐的話，那我可以吿訴你，在英國倫敦的博物院裏至今還陳列着我國北宋時做影戲用的驢皮·油盞……，不過中國的博物院似乎沒有這種古董貨。</p>

<h3>Kurusu and Nomura Await New Instructions; U.S. Position Remains Firm; Atmosphere Seems Slightly Optimistic, But Outcome Uncertain; Japanese Newspaper Claims Tojo Has No Intention of Insisting on Demands</h3>
<p>Washington, 20th (United Press) – Yesterday, there was a cautious optimism here about the possibility of a peaceful resolution to the major issues in U.S.-Japan relations. The two Japanese envoys are currently awaiting instructions from Tokyo regarding the points raised by Secretary of State Hull in recent long talks. If Kurusu and Nomura receive a reply from Tokyo, they may meet with Hull again this afternoon. Sources close to the Japanese and American sides in the Washington negotiations express optimism about the possibility of a peaceful resolution. However, they recognize that past efforts in the same direction have not been successful. It is said that the talks are now more promising than the talks between Hull and Ambassador Nomura when Kurusu first arrived in the United States. However, all parties believe that the talks have not yet reached a point where a definitive prediction of the outcome is possible. Recently, Senator Pepper, a Democrat from Florida, expressed Washington's attitude toward the negotiations, stating that the Senate would reject any treaty "that would make the United States a party to any of Japan's crimes." He stated that if Japan wishes peace with the United States, Japan must abandon its aggression and withdraw from China and Vietnam. Pepper said, "If Kurusu informs Washington that Japan has realized the error of its past actions, decided to eradicate the evils it has generated, and abandoned its aggression, he will be infinitely welcomed… But if he comes here to obtain our country's approval for Japan to keep its loot, or to make our country an accomplice by tacit consent to Japan's crimes, he will surely return disappointed." This statement seems to represent the attitude of Washington's congressional leaders, showing that the United States has not retreated from its previous position. Of even greater significance is Pepper's warning that "if war is the price for resisting Japan's participation in international atrocities, then war will surely come." Recently, authoritative circles have stated that Britain is receiving reports on the U.S.-Japan talks at any time.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 20th – Official sources here strongly endorse Senator Pepper's statement that if Japan wants to maintain peace with the United States, it must cease all acts of aggression and withdraw its troops from China and Vietnam. It is said that this is Japan's only way out. If Japan does not decide to completely break away from its crimes and abide by the Nine-Power Treaty, Secretary of State Hull's Fourteen Points, and the Roosevelt-Churchill Declaration, the United States will not remain silent. As for Pepper's request that Kurusu must bear in mind that the United States is not a nation of appeasement when talking with U.S. government leaders, people here believe that this is especially sufficient to summarize the current situation between Japan and the United States.</p>
<p>Washington, 20th – Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the U.S. government is unwilling to establish an agreement on the Far East situation that would allow Japan to have any control over China in politics, military affairs, and economics. It is said that he has heard that the Japanese side wants to station troops in five major cities in China, but such troops would inevitably control all of China. He expressed great admiration for China's heroic war effort. He personally feels that the only fair solution is for the Japanese army to withdraw from China.</p>
<p>Chinese, British, Dutch, and Australian Envoys Visit Hull for Talks</p>
<p>Washington, 19th – Ambassador Hu Shih visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday afternoon. This move is clearly related to developments in the Far East situation. When the ambassador left the State Department, he declined to comment, but his expression showed optimism.</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Reuters) – British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Campbell visited U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday evening, but it has not been announced whether the Far East situation was discussed. The cold atmosphere created by Kurusu's visit to Washington still exists. Government officials are apparently quite indignant at the bellicose remarks made by Japanese leaders in Tokyo. Hull and the Japanese representatives have not held a formal meeting, and there are no appointments for today (Thanksgiving).</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Reuters) – Dutch Minister to the United States Loudon visited Secretary of State Hull and Welles yesterday when U.S.-Japan discussions were temporarily suspended. It is reported that Loudon learned from the Secretary of State about the nature of the talks between the U.S. authorities and Nomura and Kurusu. Australian Minister Casey also visited the State Department yesterday.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) – General opinion in London is that Kurusu's mission to the United States is a delaying tactic. However, some also say that Kurusu's remarks should be listened to before the talks break down, and the reasons he holds should be carefully considered. A Washington dispatch from the Times stated that it is as clear as day that if Japan insists on sacrificing China, it will not succeed.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (United Press) – Here, people are quietly awaiting news of the Washington talks. Japanese newspapers are also uniformly adopting a more moderate tone towards the United States. Some Japanese newspapers coincide with Washington news reports that the U.S.-Japan talks have a more optimistic trend, believing that there is a strong hope for a friendly resolution to the negotiations between President Roosevelt and special envoy Kurusu. The influential "Chugai Commercial News" stated that Japan is prepared to make concessions to the United States. According to the newspaper, which usually speaks for Japanese financial leaders, including the opinions of cabinet officials, Prime Minister Tojo, although "he announced his three principles, has no intention of insisting on Japan's demands, because mutual concessions are necessary in diplomatic negotiations." It also stated, "We believe that the United States has hope for reconsideration, and the United States must cease aid to China as a practical action." The "Teito News" declared this morning, "We do not want to witness a war between the United States and Japan. We believe that the United States also desires peace. Therefore, our only hope is for peace and tranquility in the Pacific."</p>
<h3>British Battleship Visits Cape Town; May Sail to the Far East Soon; Foreign Secretary Eden Warns in the House of Commons That If Japan Attacks the Burma Road, a Serious Situation Will Be Created</h3>
<p>Cape Town, 20th (United Press) – The British elite battleship "Prince of Wales" recently sailed to this place for a short visit. British Prime Minister Churchill recently issued a message stating that Britain is now capable of increasing its strength in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, yesterday, non-official sources believed that these two matters have a wonderful mutual echo. People recalled that naval experts had predicted that Britain might send a heavy-class battleship, assisted by several cruisers and destroyers, to the Far East, especially since it is currently widely rumored that Germany has sent the elite battleship "Tirpitz" to the East to join the Japanese fleet in preparation for a war between the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) – Yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question from Mander in the House of Commons, saying that if the Burma Road is threatened, the democracies will take strong action. He thought that all concerned should know that an attack on the Burma Road would cause a serious situation. At the same time, the activities of the Japanese navy in Vietnam have also attracted attention. According to responsible sources, four Japanese cruisers have arrived in Saigon. Apart from demonstrating and putting pressure on Thailand, there is no other reason for this action by the Japanese ships. General Macksey, a military reporter for the newspaper, stated that although Thailand provides very important convenience, Japan is not sentimental in land warfare. Although the Burma Road is not an impregnable place, this road is actually more moving on the map than in reality. He believes that a naval attack on commerce by Japan is a more likely move, because Japan may continue to seize bases south to the Fiji Islands and west to Borneo Island, in order to cut off the Allies from many war supplies from their territories and the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – British Foreign Secretary Eden again expressed a hostile attitude towards Japan yesterday. He declared in the House of Commons that an attack on the Burma Road would cause a serious situation, which everyone should clearly understand. Before Eden made this statement, Member of Parliament Backham had solemnly pointed out the strategic importance of the Burma Road to the military situation of the three countries of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States in the Far East.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Arrive in Vietnam to Threaten Thailand</p>
<p>London, 20th (United Press) – Authoritative sources stated yesterday that recent intelligence on the activities of the Japanese navy to Britain all indicated that Japan has increased pressure on Thailand, but it is not known whether this is for a joint defense alliance or to merge Thailand into Japan's "Co-Prosperity Sphere" in East Asia. Authoritative circles criticized the rumor that four Japanese cruisers had arrived in Saigon, saying, "There is no special reason for this move, because the situation there is very calm, this move is only to show their flag there." This explanation comes from a report by the United Press from Bangkok, in which a diplomat in the region expressed great pessimism and said that the situation is very dangerous. The declaration was issued at the same time as editorials in two Thai newspapers advocating closer ties with Japan, and stating that Japan's possible aggression is just propaganda. People in Bangkok all believe that the concentration of Japanese troops on the Vietnamese border is a threat to Thailand's independence. At the same time, a diplomat said that he believed Thailand wanted to remain neutral, but "it is not certain." He stated that Thailand would resist to the "last man," and if it encounters any superior force, it will order the entire country to rise up in unison, and thereafter everything will depend on the attitude of Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Hanoi, 19th (Havas) – Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa made a statement to American reporters today, saying that Japan only wants to promote Japanese-Vietnamese relations in politics, economics, and culture with respect to Vietnam. Apart from this, there are no other intentions. Therefore, Japan does not want to expand its influence here. As for when the Japanese troops in Vietnam will be withdrawn, everything will depend on the Sino-Japanese War and the situation in the Pacific. Japan respects French sovereignty in Vietnam, and this is the case now and will be the case in the future. If a foreign country attacks French colonies, Japan will be prepared to defend Vietnam.</p>
<p>British Women and Children Not Allowed to Return to Hong Kong</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) – Colonial Undersecretary George Hall said in the House of Commons last night in response to a question from Conservative Party member Knox that the political situation in the Far East does not yet allow British women and children who have left Hong Kong to return to Hong Kong, and the Colonial Office has not received reports that British women in Hong Kong must be evacuated altogether. As for the matter of British and foreign women entering Hong Kong, it currently depends entirely on the needs of Hong Kong's defense and other public services. Knox said that some British women and children were forced to evacuate from Hong Kong, but there are still 950 British women, 400 children, and many European and American women and children remaining in Hong Kong, and mixed-race people and Chinese people number as many as 750,000. Does the Colonial Office also know about this situation? Can those who have been evacuated return to Hong Kong at their own will? If those who have been evacuated are not allowed to return due to military necessity, then why not issue an order for the total evacuation of women and children? Knox asked again after the Colonial Undersecretary's reply, whether American women can be allowed to land in Hong Kong. George Hall replied that he could not say whether American women would still be allowed to land in Hong Kong, but the U.S. government had advised American women to leave the country and promised to provide ships for their departure.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Reuters) – The Japanese Hochi Shimbun today urged Britain to withdraw all troops in Hong Kong, including the Canadian troops who recently arrived there, because Japan has a reliable peaceful determination and is willing to maintain the integrity of Hong Kong. The newspaper has always reflected the opinions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is said that the arrival of Canadian troops is another unreasonable provocation, which cannot enhance defense against its isolated position and make Hong Kong more stable. It also stated, "It is best if Britain can withdraw all garrison troops in Hong Kong and trust Japan's peaceful intentions."</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Mission to Depart Soon; Large Quantities of Supplies Being Shipped to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Washington, 20th (Reuters) – According to the Department of the Army, no information has been released yet regarding the U.S. military mission that will be sent to the Soviet Union. The movement of troops and other personnel is all within the scope of military secrets. However, there seems to be good reason to believe that the departure of the military mission will not be delayed for long.</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Reuters) – War supplies worth 50 million U.S. dollars, which the United States did not want to ship for fear of falling into German hands, are now on their way to the Soviet Union. This shows the trust of the United States in the situation in the Soviet Union. Experts here now acknowledge that the Soviet side now has the opportunity to relieve the siege of Moscow and connect with Leningrad.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union's Policy Toward Japan Remains Unchanged; No Need to Hold Meetings</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – A spokesman for the Soviet government, Kubyshev, replied to inquiries about the current tense Soviet-Japanese relations, saying that the Soviet Union's policy toward Japan is still based on the Neutrality Pact signed last year, and there is no need for the Soviet Union and Japan to hold meetings to re-discuss the policy.</p>
<p>Moscow, 19th (Havas) – Japanese Foreign Minister Togo delivered a speech yesterday, saying that the Japanese government intends to continue to abide by the Japanese-Soviet Ten-Article Treaty. The local radio station recently translated and rebroadcast the full text of the speech.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Around Moscow; German Defeat on the Southern Front; Red Army Tenaciously Defends Tula</h3>
<p>Moscow, 20th (TASS) – On the 17th, our army fought with the enemy on all fronts. The battles around Rostov, Kalinin, and Volokolamsk were particularly fierce. Our army repelled enemy offensives several times, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in manpower and material. On the 18th, 24 German planes were shot down, and we lost 6 planes. On the central front, our air force destroyed 30 German tanks and 10 artillery pieces on the 18th and annihilated a battalion of enemy infantry. On the Gulf of Finland, a German detachment attempted to land in Kotelin, but was unsuccessful. Our army sank 6 enemy steamships.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) – The Soviet news agency reported that the Soviet army has recovered several key high grounds on the Crimean Peninsula. The German army was forced to abandon its occupied positions and retreat, reorganizing a new front line. The German army, which was advancing to Rostov-on-Don (known as the northern gateway to the Caucasus), launched a flanking attack in an attempt to capture the city, but failed. At the same time, the German army is fighting desperately to cut off the north-south traffic on both sides of Moscow. The Soviet Pravda telegram transmitted that the battle southeast of Tula, 100 miles south of Moscow, was extremely fierce. A German infantry regiment was killed and wounded, and in several areas of the southern front, the Soviet army advanced four to twelve miles. Moscow Radio broadcast news from the western front (Moscow) yesterday, saying that the Soviet army continued to inflict heavy blows on the enemy on the western front. The situation on the Crimean Peninsula is unclear. The German claim that they have occupied the eastern part of the peninsula has not been confirmed by the Soviet side. Moscow Radio said that the German offensives in the Kalinin area have all been repelled. The German army in the area has transferred large mechanized infantry tanks and aircraft, but although the German army has a numerical advantage and has attacked repeatedly, it has made no progress. In the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas, 65 miles west and southwest of Moscow, the Soviet army is consolidating its positions. The Soviet army under Tchakachinski, on the southern left wing of the Soviet army, is now counterattacking.</p>
<p>Moscow, 20th (TASS) – General von Kleist's mechanized unit, famous throughout the world, rampaged through France, Belgium, the Balkans, and Ukraine, and was victorious in every battle, but has now suffered a defeat in Rostov. First, Kleist attacked Rostov with two tank divisions and two motorized infantry divisions on October 31, attempting to enter the city on November 7. The German frontal attack failed, so he changed to attacking the flanks, attempting to encircle our army, but the result was that he was encircled by our army. Enemy tanks were heavily surrounded and subjected to intense artillery fire and Soviet low-flying bombers. After a day of fighting, the Red Army gained the initiative and completely defeated the enemy. Statistics show that of the 216 tanks participating in the battle, 113 were destroyed and captured. In addition, the Germans lost 273 trucks and tens of thousands of soldiers.</p>
<p>Moscow, 20th (TASS) – A special correspondent from Pravda on the central front stated that in the Volokolamsk area, the enemy concentrated four infantry divisions, one SS division, and three tank divisions. A bloody battle took place in the area on the 18th. The Red Army heroically defended every inch of the country, but eventually withdrew from several points under the pressure of the enemy's force. At other points in the area, our army counterattacked and fought fiercely with the enemy, preventing the enemy from developing its offensive.</p>
<p>Tula Front, 20th (TASS) – A special correspondent from Izvestia stated that on the 19th, the Germans continued to launch an offensive in Tula, attacking with 100 tanks and breaking into our positions, but our army immediately cut off the connection between the enemy tanks and infantry. Most of the enemy tanks were destroyed. The battle is in progress. The Soviet artillery fiercely bombarded two villages five kilometers from Tula, which were recovered by our army. The enemy was driven out by our fierce artillery fire. Our army is determined not to allow the enemy to enter the city of Tula alive.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Armed U.S. Ships to Begin Sailing Within Ten Days; Secretary of the Navy Knox Officially Announces; Five New Battleships to Be Launched This Week</h3>
<p>Washington, 20th (United Press) – Secretary of the Navy Knox announced yesterday that the first batch of armed American merchant ships will begin sailing in the middle of the tenth day after the amendment of the Neutrality Act, and it will take three or four months to arm all ships sailing on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans carrying weapons to protect weapons. He did not specify which ships would be armed first. It is believed that ships sailing in the North Atlantic, transporting goods to Britain and the Soviet Union under the Neutrality Act Amendment, will be armed first to resist the Axis raiders. He also said that he believes that American ships currently registered in Panama will be restored to American registration. Several ships have changed to flying the Panamanian flag because the government can still transport war materials to the United Kingdom, regardless of the Neutrality Act, and can enter war zones. Knox also said that there are about 1,200 American ships that can transport war supplies in the Atlantic Ocean, but said that he does not know if these ships can be armed. He also said that the Navy Department has enough artillery to serve on armed merchant ships.</p>

<h3>People's Political Council Proposal Urges Government to Convene National Assembly as Soon as Possible; Enact Constitution to Realize Constitutional Government Soon; Discussion Session Yesterday Exchanged Opinions on Commodity Price Issues</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Informed Sources) - A political proposal in the National Political Council urges the government to convene the National Assembly as soon as possible, enact a constitution, and realize constitutional government at an early date. Before this period, it is hoped that the powers of the Political Council will be expanded. The signatories are mostly people from various parties and factions, led by Chang Chun-mai, leader of the National Socialist Party. Political figures predict that there will be no problem in passing this case. The government has already made a decision to convene the National Assembly. Most of the representatives have already been elected, and the National Assembly Hall is being built in Chongqing. However, due to the fierce fighting, transportation difficulties, difficulty in gathering representatives, and the failure to elect representatives from various provinces and occupational units, the election could not proceed. Therefore, the postponement was announced last November, and the Second National Political Council, which is now in session, was organized. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The National Political Council finished listening to the administrative report last night. It is resting today, but there will still be a discussion session in which the council members freely participate to exchange opinions on commodity price issues for the financial and economic group to draft a review report. The education and forestry items in the administrative report are scheduled to be released today. The social and internal affairs have not been determined. The rest will not be published as usual. It is heard that only a limited number of items were originally scheduled for publication in this session of the Political Council, but reporters publish some tidbits every day after attending the sessions to share with readers. More noteworthy are: a certain council member asked why a huge amount of foreign exchange was specially supplied to Shanghai. Yu Hongjun said that Shanghai is also the people of China. Minister of Interior Zhou Zhongyue requested that after the implementation of the new county system, the country needs more than 435,000 police officers, not including officials. Minister of Education Chen Lifu reported that from this year, national universities will no longer add more universities. The Ministry of Education now needs more than 5.56 million yuan per month to subsidize the food costs of various schools. Female council members are still very concerned about women's rights. Liu Wang Liming said that men cook better than women, so women should not go back to the kitchen. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces War Situation for the Week of the 14th to the 20th</h3>
<p>Chongqing – (Weekly War Situation) – A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated, November 14th to 20th, that the activities of the Japanese army this week were no different from last week. A new war is still brewing. Among the domestic battlefields, only the Chinese army's attack on Zhongmu City is worth mentioning. The rest will be recorded later.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Enter Zhongmu City</p>
<p>On the night of the 13th, Chinese troops continued their fierce attack on the Japanese who had retreated to Zhongmu City. By 3 p.m. on the 14th, they had killed and wounded many Japanese soldiers and seized the opportunity to attack Zhongmu City from the northwest gates. The Japanese retreated to a corner and resisted stubbornly. The Chinese forces separately cleared out the scattered Japanese troops in the suburbs. A unit stationed outside the east gate of Zhongmu escaped eastward on wooden boats and planks from the vicinity of Maozhuang in the evening. They were met with fierce fire from the Chinese troops, who killed them all in the water. The Japanese in the suburbs have now been completely cleared. As for the Japanese who are resisting stubbornly inside the city, they are putting up a desperate struggle with the support of poison gas and fierce artillery fire from the opposite bank. The Chinese are stepping up their efforts to wipe them out. Another Japanese unit with four artillery pieces fled west along the old Longhai Railway to the vicinity of Sanwangzhuang (northwest of Zhongmu) on the same night, attempting to cross the river to harass the Chinese flank and relieve the Japanese troops in Zhongmu. They were met with fierce artillery fire from the Chinese and retreated after suffering losses.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Between Chinese and Japanese Armies on the South Bank of the Yellow River</p>
<p>In the area of the old Yellow River Iron Bridge, Chinese and Japanese troops have been repeatedly charging and fighting fiercely in the area north of Hantong Ditch to Bawangcheng. Many Japanese have been killed. On the night of the 14th, a Japanese unit detoured through Zhangdong to the vicinity of Wu Hai. They were repulsed by the Chinese. From the morning of the 15th, the Japanese used multiple aircraft in shifts to bomb and assist in the battle, with five or six aircraft in each batch. They also used poison gas. Many of the Chinese attacking units were affected by the gas, but their morale was high and they continued to engage the Japanese in fierce fighting on the original front line.</p>
<p>Small Victories for Chinese Troops in Northern Hunan and Guangdong</p>
<p>On the night of the 8th, a Japanese unit in northern Hunan secretly crossed the Xinqiang River at Sanggangzui and attacked the Chinese.

In the afternoon, they test-fired artillery at the Chinese in an attempt to attack. They were suppressed by the Chinese counterattack, and the Japanese became silent. On the 14th, the Japanese near Sanshui added more than a thousand troops from Sanshui County. At dawn on the 15th, they attacked the vicinity of Qingqi. They were met by a counterattack from the Chinese troops, and fighting continued until noon on the 16th. The Japanese suffered many casualties and retreated to Sanshui.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Captain in Northern Anhui Rebels</p>
<p>Xilin, a Japanese platoon leader stationed in Hugou, Suxian County, organized an anti-war alliance. He has been discovered by the Japanese and sent back to his country. One of his subordinates, Hisatoshi Saigoshi, a private first class, recently managed to escape from a Japanese sentry post in Suxian and surrendered to the Chinese side. According to him, the Japanese lack supplies and have difficulty replenishing them. If the British and Americans maintain a long-term blockade, their country is in danger of collapse. The war of aggression against China is not worth the losses. Therefore, most enlightened soldiers have a strong anti-war sentiment. He himself is an orphan and has no family to worry about, so he resolutely came to surrender and requested permission to join the anti-aggression alliance and become a Chinese citizen.

<h3>Turmoil in the Japanese Diet; Miyazawa Forced to Resign; Reason: Criticism of Economic Policy; Many Colleagues Prepare to Resign En Masse</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, November 20 – Yesterday was the last day of the extraordinary session of the Diet. Member of the House of Representatives Miyazawa spoke, uniquely criticizing the government's economic policies. He was then forced to retract his words. Miyazawa then voluntarily resigned from his position as a member of the Diet. Miyazawa is a member of the House of Representatives' Loyalist Alliance. According to the Japanese news agency, all the directors of the Alliance are likely to resign.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, November 20 – The Japanese Diet is facing an impending internal crisis, as nineteen members of the House of Representatives' largest political party, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, have submitted their resignations from the party, expressing sympathy for Miyazawa's speech. Miyazawa's speech was apparently a criticism of the government's policies. People recall that the Emperor, in his opening address to the Diet, requested that the Diet give "harmonious consideration" to the government's bills. Therefore, Miyazawa's criticism was deemed to be culpable. Whether Miyazawa criticized the government's general policies or merely criticized the government's unprecedented massive budget of 3,800,000,000 yen is unknown.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, November 20 – The nationalist "Hochi Shimbun," regardless of the incident of Miyazawa's expulsion, wrote an article contrasting Japan's "steel will" with the party divisions in the United States. The newspaper claimed that the unity of the Diet was "not intended to influence the Washington talks with artificial tricks." After Miyazawa delivered his speech in the Diet, he resigned from his position as secretary of the House of Representatives, which the Diet immediately accepted. Miyazawa issued a statement withdrawing his speech, saying, "My speech had the absolute opposite effect of what I originally intended, causing disputes among my colleagues in the Diet. I deeply regret this and therefore wish to resign." Prior to this, the most powerful political party in the Diet, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, decided to advise the Disciplinary Committee to instruct Miyazawa to submit his resignation, considering this fact to be unfortunate. The resolution of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association stated that the party would be responsible for the speech, but would "allow Mr. Miyazawa to voluntarily withdraw his speech." It also stated that the party would not oppose the House of Representatives leaving the matter to its Disciplinary Committee. According to Domei News Agency, this incident is the first to occur since the special session of the Diet was convened. Domei also stated that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association wished to leave the matter to the House of Representatives' Disciplinary Committee because the content of the speech was "contrary to the mission of the special session." Furthermore, Domei stated that Miyazawa's actions were likely to cause the entire committee of the National Service Association to resign. Domei also said that it was understood that Okada, the leader of the Executive Committee, would resign voluntarily, and that other Executive Committee members would follow suit. Furthermore, it was said that the movement of the group was currently being planned.</p>

<h3>British Offensive in Libya</h3>
<p>The British forces in North Africa have commenced a vigorous offensive against Libya since the 18th, making rapid progress. It is recalled that on the 6th of this month, the Chairman of the Soviet State Defense Committee, Stalin, delivered a speech at the October Revolution Commemoration Meeting in Moscow, stating, "The reason why the Red Army is temporarily encountering adversity is due to the lack of a second front against Hitler in Europe; if a second front can be built in Europe, then the Red Army's position will definitely improve and be unfavorable to Germany. We firmly believe that this will become a reality in the near future." At the same time, the British Parliament and general public opinion also largely support the establishment of new battlefields, both to assist the Soviet Union and to strike at Germany. In response, the British government, since the matter involves military secrets, has avoided making a public response, but British Prime Minister Churchill, known as a strategist, certainly fully recognizes the importance of this point and is actively arranging for its realization. Yesterday's newspaper carried a Reuters dispatch from London stating that the British authorities are significantly refreshing the ranks of the army and that there will be important changes in its senior command: the current Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces, General Brooke, will succeed General Dill as Chief of the Imperial General Staff; Lieutenant General Paget, Commander-in-Chief of the Southeastern Command, will succeed as Commander-in-Chief of the Home Forces; and General Dill will take office as Governor of Bombay Province in India. According to the observation of Reuters' military correspondents, this change is the prelude to Britain engaging in land warfare in a more active form. Therefore, the unfolding of the North African offensive is likely the prelude to the British army opening up a second front and launching a large-scale land counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Let us examine the British combat capability. The navy is undoubtedly its backbone, but as a result of recent military buildup and preparedness, the British army and air force are also considerable, and the air force in particular has made rapid progress in both quality and quantity, repeatedly demonstrating its power in Europe. If Britain opens up a land battlefield against Germany, it will certainly use the army in coordination with the air force as the main force in combat. However, to fully exploit its own advantages, it should mobilize the navy to launch offensive attacks with the cooperation of the navy and army. Suitable battlefields for the British army to land and operate in, in Western Europe, are Norway and the west coast of France; in Southern Europe, Italy and the Balkans; and in North Africa, Libya. However, Norway is remote in the northwest and insufficient to be the center of the war situation. Although the occupied areas of France and the various places in Italy and the Balkans are experiencing famine and popular resentment is boiling, due to the convenience of transportation, they are a tightly connected entity with the German mainland. German reinforcements can arrive from morning until evening, which is unfavorable to the British army landing and attacking across the sea. However, Libya is different. Libya is an Italian territory, now jointly defended by Germany and Italy. However, after Mussolini's several "purges," the actual command authority has completely fallen into the hands of the Germans. However, the German generals and officers, as foreigners, hold the power to issue orders, but ultimately fail to unify the morale of the army, and the fighting spirit is greatly reduced as a result. Moreover, there is the Mediterranean Sea between Germany and Italy and Libya, and control of the Mediterranean Sea is still in the hands of the British. Although it is not impossible for Axis personnel and weapons to be smuggled to North Africa, there is a great danger involved, and they can be sunk or captured by British patrol ships at any time. In addition, Egypt is a British military ally, and its operational base is shared with the British. After Duke Aosta, the commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in Abyssinia, surrendered to the British on May 20 of this year, the entire East Africa and Red Sea area has been completely under British control. Therefore, in terms of the strategic situation on the West European continent, the Axis powers are waiting at their ease, while in the North African strategic situation, Britain is the main body. Therefore, the British army is launching a counteroffensive here in an advantageous position. Last winter and this spring, when General Wavell was stationed in Cairo, he also launched exploratory offensives against Libya. At that time, Germany and Italy had not yet opened the war against the Soviet Union and were able to use more power to cope with the British offensive. As for today, the Soviet Union is fighting with all its might against the elite German forces in Eastern Europe, and Germany has absolutely no sufficient spare power to attend to other things. Therefore, the British army in North Africa, coordinating with the British fleet in the Mediterranean Sea, is launching a large-scale westward offensive, which should be able to achieve more gains and establish permanent war results.</p>
<p>At this time, foreign news came that General Weygand, the French Governor-General of Africa, was suddenly dismissed by the Vichy government. General Weygand has been stationed in Africa since France's defeat last year, commanding a portion of the armed forces to provide strong support for Vichy; Pétain was sometimes able to cope with Germany quite strongly, and Weygand had a powerful role in this. His sudden dismissal is likely related to this, and Germany's desire for French territories in Africa, constantly increasing pressure on France, can also be seen from this. The French North Africa is of great importance both militarily and economically, just as it is to the western Mediterranean as Egypt is to the eastern Mediterranean; and French West Africa is both a springboard for developing influence towards South America and sufficient to control the South Atlantic. It is within Germany's intention to want to obtain this and be satisfied. At the same time, Germany has recently made quite a few attempts towards Turkey and Spain. All of these factors further increase the importance of the British army's offensive in North Africa. Currently, Libya is the only central base of the Axis powers in Africa. If it can be wiped out in one fell swoop, it will not only consolidate Britain's control over Africa and eliminate Germany's attempt to expand its power in Africa, but also make the Mediterranean transportation line connecting Britain and the Soviet Union more secure, so as to lay the foundation for further military development in the future.</p>
<h3>Allied Forces on the Nile Launch Offensive in North Africa, Penetrate 50 Miles into Libyan Territory, British Naval and Air Forces Also Join the Battle</h3>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 20th – Last night, an official gazette issued here stated that the Allied forces led by General Auchinleck have launched a new offensive against the Axis forces in the western desert, making rapid progress. By the end of the first day, they had penetrated over fifty miles into enemy territory. Until then, they had only encountered slight resistance from the enemy. Today’s military operations are proceeding according to plan. British forces are currently advancing along a 140-mile-wide arc-shaped front, from Sollum southward through the desert to Giarabub. The British right wing is advancing westward from the Halfaya Pass to Sidi Omar, while British armored vehicles, aided by infantry, have crossed the border eastward, attacking enemy coastal positions. The British communiqué mentioned the absence of enemy air support, which observers here consider unsurprising. Axis aircraft in North Africa may be inactive due to fuel conservation. It is reported that heavy rains are currently falling in the war zone, which has both advantages and disadvantages for the British forces. The advantage is that it is difficult for the enemy to observe, but the disadvantage is that the land is muddy. Now that General Auchinleck has launched the attack, the active preparations of many months can be revealed. Although everyone knew that there would be developments in the western desert and saw troops, artillery, tanks, and military supplies being transported westward in a steady stream, few understood the thoroughness of the British preparations. First, transportation had to be improved to transport food and supplies to support the large army. Old roads were renovated, and new roads were built, with the assistance of road-building machinery transported from South Africa. Storage depots were also built in various locations to store gasoline, ammunition, food, and water. Only after all preparations were complete did General Auchinleck issue the order to attack. The preparations for this offensive have many similarities to the preparations before the offensive last year, especially the assembly of the large army. The British forces are now taking the initiative and moving forward, but there is one peculiar factor: the line of fortifications built by the Germans this summer from the coast southward along the border to Sidi Omar appears to have no effect in stopping the British advance.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 20th – After the British forces in the western desert launched their offensive, they captured several enemies, all of whom were German soldiers. The British Navy is currently bombarding the Halfaya Pass, and the Germans, caught by surprise, are panicked and their formations are collapsing.</p>
<p>British Forces Continue Westward, Three Axis Divisions Trapped</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th – According to the latest news received here, the British forces stationed on the Nile, recently renamed the Eighth Army, with the assistance of a strong British Air Force, have suddenly taken action in the western desert, attacking over fifty miles into enemy territory in Libya and are continuing to advance westward. According to a dispatch from Cairo, two German divisions are now cut off between Bardia and Tobruk, and one Italian division is trapped south of Tobruk. British fighter squadrons shot down eighteen German and Italian aircraft in the initial air battles. South African Air Force bombers also attacked enemy transport vehicles and armored vehicles, inflicting heavy damage. Today, both German and Italian communiqués mentioned the British offensive in Libya.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th – The Nile Garrison (mostly British, Australian, New Zealand, and Indian troops) launched an offensive against Axis forces in the western desert at dawn on Tuesday. The British fleet has joined the battle, heavily bombarding Halfaya and Sollum. At the same time, the British Air Force destroyed eighteen enemy aircraft in its first large-scale air battle, including five transport aircraft. Although the British offensive was expected, the Germans were caught by surprise and panicked, causing their formations to disperse, and several German soldiers were captured. The British line of advance extends from the coast east of Sollum to Giarabub, about 130 miles long. The three leaders of this campaign are: on land, Lieutenant General Cunningham, who has successfully fought in East Africa and now commands the Allied convoys west of Alexandria; at sea, his brother, Admiral Cunningham, currently Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet; and in the air, Air Vice-Marshal Coningham, currently Commander of the Western Desert Air Force.</p>
<p>Deliberate Preparations for Over a Year, Conditions for Offensive Completed</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th (Special) – A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from the western desert that the British people have been waiting for news of a new British offensive in the western desert for many weeks, and now this news has finally arrived. The new offensive undertaken by the British forces under the command of General Auchinleck comes exactly one year and three weeks after General Wavell first launched his "Desert Blitzkrieg," advancing five hundred miles in two months and capturing 110,000 Italian soldiers. General Auchinleck, succeeding General Wavell in command of the British forces in the western desert, has prepared deliberately and must have drawn up his plans as carefully as General Wavell. He waited until the scorching sun of the desert weakened, military supplies were transported from Britain, and the British Navy sank as many enemy ships as possible before launching this new offensive. Although the enemy’s strength and preparation are stronger than the Italian army, General Auchinleck’s new offensive has signs of success in many ways. The British Air Force has established air superiority in the western desert, so the British supply lines are much safer than the enemy's. This is extremely important in a battle fought along two or three roads in the desert. The British supply lines in this offensive have been greatly assisted by the Italian army, as the Italian army built excellent motor roads from Barrani to Alam el Rabita on the Libyan border when they invaded Egyptian territory. Building this road in peacetime would cost about £60,000. When the Italian army was driven out of Egypt by the British army, the road was not yet completed, but it has since been built by the British army and engineers and is a shortcut for British armored vehicles and supply trucks to reach the front line. Another immeasurable help in this British offensive is the presence of British and Polish troops in Tobruk, behind enemy lines. These troops have endured the heat, sandstorms, and bombings for a long time and will now be rewarded for their perseverance. Tobruk is an excellent naval port where supplies and reinforcements can be landed to assist in the battle. However, we should not expect this offensive to achieve the same rapid results as last year, as an important factor in last year's victory was that British infantry tanks were superior to Italian tanks. Now, the Germans have transported a large number of heavily armored tanks and anti-tank guns to Libya, so a fierce battle between the mechanized units of the two armies seems inevitable. But one thing is certain: the British armored units will fight the enemy with the same bravery they showed last year, and after actively preparing for over a year, they must be eager to fight the enemy to the death. Most of the British soldiers participating in this offensive have participated in other battles in this war, and some have been transferred to the western desert after triumphs in Eritrea and Syria. These men said that their only wish was to fight the Germans again on more equal terms, and now they have this opportunity. On the barren desert land, the conditions for the British and German armies are almost the same, because the Germans have no Fifth Column or political conspiracies to help them in the western desert.</p>
<p>Britain Responds to Allied Soviet Union, New Anti-Axis Front</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th – A Reuters correspondent with the British forces in Libya telegraphed that the British and German armies are now fighting on the battlefields of the western desert, and Britain has responded to the call of its ally, the Soviet Union, by opening a new front against the Axis powers. Although the number of German troops in North Africa is smaller than the number of Italian troops, the current campaign is the first test of strength between the British and German armies after the battles of Greece and Crete. Moreover, most of the British soldiers participating in this offensive are from the British Isles, and the proportion of those from the Dominions is smaller than before. British soldiers are now choosing to fight the Germans because killing one German soldier is better than capturing six Italian soldiers. In the week or two before the British forces began their attack, the roads and railways along the Mediterranean Sea to Mersa Matruh were busy with transport. Reporters saw trains loaded with tanks arriving in a steady stream, and convoys of trucks stretched for thirty miles along the roads, each convoy equipped with no fewer than one hundred anti-aircraft guns. In short, the British preparations were extremely thorough.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 10th – According to a communiqué from the British Air Force in the Middle East, the British Air Force destroyed eighteen German aircraft during offensive patrols over Cyrenaica on Tuesday. Naples, Italy, was also one of the targets of the British bombers. British aircraft also attacked enemy convoys in the central Mediterranean Sea on the same day, and a medium-sized merchant ship was hit, exploded, and caught fire. One British aircraft did not return.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 20th – On the eve of the British offensive in the western desert, British generals read to the troops a special message of encouragement from British Prime Minister Winston Churchill.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 20th – All newspapers here published the British offensive in Libya in large print. Newspaper editorials and radio commentators believe that the British forces are well-equipped and consider this offensive to be a full-scale effort to eliminate the Axis forces in Africa. Some commentators say that this offensive is a timely move to eliminate possible surprise actions by Berlin and Vichy in North Africa. Others say that American equipment plays an important role in this offensive.</p>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 20th – The Australian public is elated by the British offensive in Libya. All newspapers reported it in large headlines. When Minister for the Army Ford announced the news in the House of Representatives, the entire House cheered.</p>
<h3>River Journey in Sichuan (II)</h3>
<p>— Ji Sheng</p>
<p>The boat was already groaning under the resistance of the rapids, “clap, clap”. The helmsman held the rudder with his right hand, and with his left hand, he held a bamboo pole, raising his backside and pushing forward. The two trackers on the shore bore an even heavier burden, their limbs on the ground, their chests parallel to the ground, incessantly “ah-ho, ah-ho”, but unable to move forward even half a step. “Guys, lend a hand!” The call for help replaced “ah-ho”. Five new recruits rushed up together, grabbing the tow rope made of woven bamboo strips. Surprisingly, the rushing water could not withstand the combined strength of these eight people, and the boat slowly moved forward.</p>
<p>Learning the steps of the old trackers, walking leisurely on the red sand beach, suddenly the tow rope led us to a pebble beach. The heat of the pebbles under the sunlight touched the tender soles of every new tracker, eliciting a chorus of cries of pain. The weight in our hands prevented us from escaping this pain, and the dampness by the water made us reluctant to put on clean cloth shoes. So, “Straw sandals, straw sandals, go to Qianwei to get straw sandals!” The suggestion of the old trackers became the decision of the new trackers. But none of the old trackers were wearing straw sandals.</p>
<p>Finally, we were pulled into the water by the tow rope, “Ah, how comfortable!” The water was warmed by the sun, and our feet stepped on the smooth pebbles, feeling refreshing and cool. The heavy footsteps disturbed the quietness of the water and scattered the gatherings of the small fish! This kind of waterside gave the new trackers with an air of elegance a great temptation. Some even wanted to play the game of catching small fish after the boat had passed the rapids and they were relieved of their responsibility.</p>
<p>The boat ran aground on a bend in the pebble beach. Two old trackers wearing long gowns walked down to the river and slowly guided the boat into deeper water. When working in the water, they rolled up their long gowns to their waists, revealing that they were not wearing trousers. After going ashore, they transformed themselves again and resumed their cultured appearance. At this time, I, lying on the grass waiting for the boat to move, was quite interested in this. But looking into the distance, there was a worker standing in the upper reaches of the river carrying our boat, the water reaching his chest, he simply turned his long gown down and wore it as a turban on his head. Someone said, “The people of Sichuan are truly cultured, even the laborers often wear a long gown.” However, the boatmen had to do this for the sake of politeness and for the convenience of work. If you go to desolate and precipitous sections, you can see batches of naked trackers pulling cargo ships without female passengers. It’s as if you were in a German health camp, which was heavily promoted ten years ago!</p>
<p>After passing Qianwei, we often crossed hillsides and harbors. Walking up a hill, the boatmen would ask for someone to be assigned to “guard the rear”, to take care of the tow rope, so as not to get caught on tree branches or rocks and hinder progress. This was a very arduous task; sometimes we had to cross unnecessary sharp peaks, sometimes we had to climb onto large rocks jutting out from the river bank, sometimes we lagged far behind, sometimes we moved forward very quickly. So, we often took turns, or even two people worked at the same time. If we encountered the most arduous and dangerous moments, the boatmen had to take matters into their own hands.</p>
<p>When we reached the Wen River or places unsuitable for towing, we had to all get on the boat and drift across the river. In a section where cliffs and precipices gathered on both sides of the river, our small wooden boat with a shallow draft traveled along the foot of the cliff, while using bamboo poles to push against the conical cavities carved into the smooth cliff face – these cavities are the crystallization of the hard work of countless boatmen over the centuries. "Human ingenuity is great", we moved forward effortlessly following the trails of our predecessors, and could not help but exclaim in this way.</p>
<p>At this time, a heavily loaded boat was sailing in the middle of the river. The helmsman standing on the elevated wooden platform at the stern of the boat was steering the boat while beating a small drum, and the sound of the drum was combined with the sound of twelve oars and the sound of “ah-ho” sung by twelve boatmen. When the boat reached the rapids, all the rowers turned around and desperately pulled back on the oars. The sound of the drum became faster, the sound of the oars became faster, and the sound of “ah-ho” also became faster, and at the same time, a series of footsteps on the deck was heard. Passing through the valley, all the sounds stopped, and the rowers successively jumped into the water and walked on the tow path to pull the boat.</p>

<h3>C Zone Handover Issue to be Decided by Garrison Conference, Part of Defense Already Handed Over to the Municipal Council, US Military Equipment Transported to Pudong Yesterday, Over 1,000 British Nationals in Occupied Areas Preparing to Evacuate</h3>
<p>The American President Lines has dispatched the President Van Buren to Qinhuangdao to transport the US troops stationed in North China and dispatched the President Madison and President Harrison to Shanghai to transport the Fourth Regiment of the US Marine Corps stationed in this city. The President Madison is scheduled to arrive at 3:30 PM today and is scheduled to dock at buoys 14 and 15. There will be a slight delay in Shanghai. It is said that it will depart for the Philippines at the same time after the President Harrison arrives in Shanghai next Tuesday (25th). The President Madison has brought a large number of goods from the United States this time. It is said that the goods destined for the Philippines and this city will not be loaded, but passenger tickets will be sold as usual.</p>
<p>Garrison Conference to be Held Soon</p>
<p>With the withdrawal of the Fourth Regiment of the US Marine Corps imminent, the Municipal Council held a meeting yesterday (19th) to discuss the issue of the handover of Zone C left by the US Marines, but no decision was made. It is reported that the Municipal Council will listen to the final decision of the conference of commanders of the various countries' garrisons regarding the handover of Zone C and has notified the secretary of the conference of this intention. A reporter inquired of one of the members of the conference this morning, who said that the date of the meeting had not been determined but said that it would probably be held soon. The members of the conference are the commanders of the US, Japanese, and Italian garrisons, the commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and the Commissioner of Police of the Municipal Council. It is rumored that part of the US Navy will leave Shanghai first on two special ships for the evacuation of Americans. According to Colonel Howard, commander of the Fourth Regiment, this is indeed true and should not be considered strange. However, the American President Lines has denied the rumor that the special ship for the evacuation of Americans will leave Shanghai on Saturday (22nd). It is said that the ship will remain in Shanghai for a longer period.</p>
<p>Part of the Defense Has Already Been Handed Over</p>
<p>It is said that the US Navy handed over the defense of the area along the Suzhou Creek from the New Zhapu Bridge to Yichang Road to the Municipal Council on the 18th. All the military telephones, watch posts, and sentry posts installed by the US military have been successively removed. At 1:30 PM that afternoon, the Putuo Road Police Station of the Police Department dispatched Japanese police officer Kurata and one Chinese, Japanese, and Indian constable each to take over the area.</p>
<p>Howard Pays Courtesy Visit to Japanese Military Officers</p>
<p>Colonel Howard, commander of the Fourth Regiment of the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, accompanied by Major Hamilton and Captain Pettick, visited Major General Ooka at the Japanese Naval Commissioner's Office on Haining Road at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. At 9:30 AM, they boarded the Izumo warship and visited Vice Admiral Koga, commander of the Japanese Fleet in China. At 10:00 AM, they visited Rear Admiral Makita, commander of the Japanese Naval Special Landing Forces, to bid farewell and express their gratitude for their past cooperation.</p>
<p>US Military Equipment Begins to Be Transported</p>
<p>A large number of luggage, equipment, and materials of the US garrison stationed in Shanghai began to be transported yesterday morning under the order of the US garrison commander. The equipment was transported in batches by military trucks to the Municipal Council Wharf on the Bund on Fuzhou Road and then transferred to Pudong by a small wheel boat. It is said that after the President Harrison arrives in Shanghai, it will dock at the Pudong Wharf.</p>
<h3>Shops Refuse to Sell Price-Controlled Goods, Causing Shortages, Indirectly Undermining Price Controls Should be Investigated and Punished Promptly, Method for Limiting the Price of National Rice Has Been Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council stipulated the price control of daily necessities, the residents of this city have been cheering. Unexpectedly, some shops, because they could not profit from selling at the controlled prices, refused to sell the price-controlled goods. For example, Scott's Emulsion is limited to 21.84 yuan for a large bottle and 12.63 yuan for a small bottle, but now pharmacies on the market all vaguely claim to have no goods to sell, resulting in another vicious phenomenon of "goods with prices but no goods", giving a huge blow to the price control decree. It is hoped that the Municipal Council will uphold its original intention of suppressing and stabilizing prices, find ways to conduct a thorough investigation, and immediately establish regulations to punish those shops that allegedly refuse to sell price-controlled goods under the pretext of having no goods, so as to prevent the secret sabotage of unscrupulous merchants. In addition, Mr. Lang, secretary of the Shanghai Consular Body, yesterday denied the rumor that the Consular Body would hold a meeting to discuss price control measures.</p>
<p>Confiscated Milk Powder to be Given to Orphans</p>
<p>It was learned yesterday that the Krining milk powder confiscated by the French Concession Police Department from various stores on the 10th of this month will be donated to orphanages and charitable organizations. These milk powders were all confiscated by the French Police Department because their selling prices were higher than the controlled prices. The authorities have ordered that the milk powder currently stored at the police station be distributed to three orphanages. It is said that a certain pharmacy at No. 601 Avenue Joffre, which was sealed on November 10, resumed business on the 14th. A certain store at No. 25 Rue du Pere Froc, which was sealed, resumed business on the 17th. Another store will also resume business today. These three stores were all sealed for selling Krining milk powder at prices exceeding the controlled prices, resulting in the confiscation of a total of 75 pounds of the milk powder and temporary closure. Now, they are resuming business one after another. It is also said that police officers from the French Police Department recently searched a store on Route Vallon and found six bottles of copper cleaner, the selling price of which was higher than the controlled price, and confiscated them.</p>
<p>Investigating Flour to Prepare for Management</p>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice that, starting from today, it will register the inventory of flour. All businesses, banks, groups, and individuals, etc., who have more than one month's worth of flour for their own use must register with Office No. 701 of the General Office of the Municipal Council (entrance from the square) before the 27th of this month and submit the daily flour consumption for reference. The French Concession will also do the same.</p>
<p>Price Control of National Rice will also be Implemented</p>
<p>The Food Rice Management Committee of the Municipal Council believes that the destination of national rice is no less than that of foreign rice. If price control is not implemented, it will affect the future of the people's food. After a long period of consultation, a decision was made to limit the selling price of national rice. All the methods have now been agreed upon in order, and they can be implemented as soon as they are discussed with the rice industry committees. According to the rice industry committees, they agree with the Food Rice Management Committee's method of evaluating and setting standard selling prices for national rice. Therefore, the entire food supply in the city will become more stable in the future.</p>
<p>According to the Rice Trade Association, the rice merchants have registered the foreign rice they imported in the past that has not yet left the warehouse. However, the Municipal Council does not issue permits to transport the rice out of the warehouse when the rice is needed for retail sales, asking for help. The association is currently processing the registration in order to negotiate with the authorities.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the first phase of collective rice sales was originally scheduled for 20,000 bags, but because the settlement and delivery procedures are very complicated, several thousand bags have not yet been delivered. However, rice merchants who lack rice are very much in need of the rice for the market. It is said that the leaders of the bean and rice industry and the rice merchant industry are discussing ways to improve the situation and plan to request the French Concession authorities to approve the delivery of rice from rice warehouses in the French Concession so that rice merchants who lack rice can [blank space].</p>
<p>Over a Thousand British Nationals Preparing to Evacuate</p>
<p>An official from the British Consulate in Shanghai said yesterday morning that 1,175 British nationals registered in the occupied areas of China may gather in Shanghai to wait for the evacuation ships sent by the British government to depart. Preparations for the arrival of the evacuation ships in Shanghai have not yet begun, but such preparations may begin soon and will be directed by the military authorities. Many Chinese nationals who were born in Singapore and Hong Kong and became British citizens are seeking passports from the Passport Office of the British Consulate General in the hope of leaving Shanghai as soon as possible. The British Consulate recently advised British nationals in the occupied areas of China to register and warned that this may be the last opportunity to evacuate China. At the same time, the British authorities in Shanghai have recruited a batch of soldiers, including some Russians, who will depart for Singapore in two days to join the British Army.</p>
<h3>American Thanksgiving Yesterday, American Director Delivered Speech, America Stands on the Side of Justice, Believes Allies Will Win</h3>
<p>American military and civilians in Shanghai flocked to the church on Jiangxi Road at 11:00 yesterday morning to participate in the Thanksgiving service. The music in the church was expressive. First, American Judge of Appeals Hale Melick read President US's Thanksgiving Day Proclamation. American Consul Stanton introduced the speakers, Bishop Roberts led the ceremony, and Pastor Qu Fanfu blessed the congregation after the service.</p>
<p>Mr. Mingside of the American Presbyterian Church</p>
<p>(American Director of the Municipal Council) delivered a speech, saying, "Even in today's world, which is suffering from various pains, the American people still have much to be grateful for, such as in the current struggle, America stands on the side of justice and has the opportunity to establish justice and fairness in the world after winning. Other things such as the promotion of democracy in the United States and the possession of raw materials and technology to implement its program of self-defense and helping others should also be thanked for God's grace. Now, Britain has not been invaded, the German-Soviet alliance has collapsed, the United States has not yet engaged in shooting wars, and in Shanghai, we enjoy a degree of peace and security that is better than we had anticipated one year ago when we bid farewell to our relatives and friends.</p>
<p>"The situation has not worsened," making us feel sincere gratitude. The American people can also discover a better way of life and establish a new world order from the errors of purpose, plan, and ideal, not allowing aggression, selfishness, abuse of power, and hatred to exist. My allies have the permanent power in the universe and will surely win."</p>
<h3>Japanese Tax Inspector Issues Another Notice: Expanding the Scope of the Embargo, Eight Types of Goods Including Cotton Are Prohibited from Export; Radford Retires After Serving His Term, Japanese Person Succeeds Him</h3>
<p>Koyama, the Japanese Tax Inspector of the General Affairs Department of the Jianghai Customs, issued Notice No. 44, expanding the scope of prohibited exports. In addition to the previously determined metals, metal products, cotton, cotton cloth, and cotton textiles, the newly added embargoed items are: 174 Cotton, 175 Waste Cotton (including fly waste), 196 Drawnwork, Openwork, Embroidery (silk and other materials), 197 Lace Ornaments, 257 Containers and Packaging Materials, 268 Straw Mats and Rush Mats, 269 Floor Mats. It is also learned that Radford, the Tax Inspector of the Jianghai Customs, will retire on the 22nd of this month after serving for 36 years and will take a position at the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau. Radford's vacancy will be filled by Koyama, the Japanese Tax Inspector of the General Affairs Department of the Customs and concurrently the Tax Inspector of the Qingdao Customs. It has been investigated that Koyama's succession to this position is the result of negotiations between Merrell and the Japanese authorities. After Koyama takes office as the Shanghai Customs Tax Inspector, Quinton, the acting Extra Tax Inspector of the General Affairs Department of the Qingdao Customs, will be promoted to Tax Inspector.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government Promulgates New Ordinance: Assisting in the Management of Legal Tender, Prohibiting Free Acceptance and Delivery and Strictly Prohibiting Exit, Authorizing Special Permits for Various Industries</h3>
<p>At the request of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, to assist the Chinese government in implementing its policy of managing legal tender, the Hong Kong government has promulgated a new ordinance prohibiting the free trading of national currency and authorizing designated banks to purchase and remit Chinese national currency with special permission. However, any transaction specially approved by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee is not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>New Ordinance Enforces Strict Restrictions</p>
<p>The new ordinance promulgated by the Hong Kong government states that any action, whether within or outside Hong Kong, that directly or indirectly creates, in whole or in part, or causes or assists in any foreign exchange transaction involving Chinese national currency, unless it is with or through a merchant or registered bank authorized by Section 1 of the ordinance, is prohibited. Anyone who owns, holds, possesses, or controls any Chinese national currency banknotes must report the total amount of banknotes to a certain person in accordance with the method instructed by the Governor during a specified period, unless (A) before November 14, 1941, or (B) they obtained, held, possessed, or controlled the banknotes, and (C) during a specified period. The following circumstances do not require reporting: (A) the total amount of banknotes owned does not exceed 5,000 national currency; (B) there is a legal business, or is a shareholder or manager of a legal business established in Hong Kong before November 6, 1941, and the banknotes owned are more than 5,000 national currency but do not exceed 30,000 national currency and are for the necessary use of the business.</p>
<p>Exit Prohibited Except to Mainland China</p>
<p>Any person holding national currency shall apply for registration, and the Registrar shall issue a certificate to the registrant or any applicant requesting permission to hold Chinese national currency banknotes. The certificate shall state the total amount of banknotes that the registrant or permitted holder is allowed to hold, and the amount may be increased or decreased within the limit. Anyone who owns, holds, possesses, or controls any Chinese currency banknotes, whether within or outside Hong Kong, except in China, is violating any such permit and is committing an offense. Any action of importing or exporting any Chinese national currency banknotes from Hong Kong, or any action of importing that directly or indirectly causes or leads to a change in the amount, and anyone who possesses or controls any Chinese national currency banknotes outside China, regardless of how and where they are placed, unless that person is of Chinese nationality and the change is only to increase or decrease the number within the limit prescribed in the certificate issued under the provisions of Section 2,</p>

<h3>The Seized Southern Ship Has Been Secretly Sailed Out of Port; No Customs Declaration Procedures Were Completed Prior; Shipping Industry Claims It Sailed to Japan</h3>
<p>The Yugoslavian merchant ship S.S. Tomislav, with a displacement of 5,411 tons, a deadweight of 3,149 tons, a length of 403 feet, a width of 52 feet, and a draft of 27.5 feet, was built in September 1928. It arrived in Shanghai with cargo this year and was managed by the British firm Tilston &amp; Co. When the ship arrived in Shanghai, Yugoslavia fell. The Italian navy stationed in Shanghai sent sailors aboard the ship to seize it. However, the ship was still unable to leave the port and was moved to Bouy 11/12 in Southern Whangpoo, where it has remained for over half a year. The day before yesterday (the 19th), it suddenly sailed out of port secretly. According to eyewitnesses, the ship passed the Lujiazui shore around 6:00 PM and exited the Wusong port around 8:00 PM. No customs declaration or clearance procedures were completed prior. According to the shipping industry, it is believed to have sailed to Japan.</p>
<h3>United States Specially Permits Chinese Merchant Banks to Operate Bills of Exchange</h3>
<p>In order to assist China in replenishing its foreign exchange fund, the United States government has specifically ordered the Department of the Treasury to amend General Circular No. 58, which was issued previously. The correspondent banks of these Chinese banks in the United States have received notification from the U.S. side. The amendment to Circular No. 58 will not arrive in Shanghai from the United States until the end of this month. The content of the amendment will grant the same rights to eight Chinese merchant banks, including Che Hsing Bank, Che Hsin Industrial Bank, Bank of Kwangtung, Kin Cheng Banking Corporation, Overseas Chinese Bank, Bank of East Asia, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and China興業 Bank, to jointly operate import and export bills of exchange for any part of China (excluding Manchuria) with fourteen Allied banks such as HSBC, Citibank, and the four major national banks. Any bank in the United States, when conducting foreign exchange transactions arising from import and export trade that comply with the provisions of the circular, such as issuing or certifying letters of credit, accepting or paying bills of exchange, or other payments or transfers, shall, before undertaking such transactions, verify, based on shipping documents or other methods, that the transaction does indeed meet the following conditions: Such transactions must be legitimate and normal imports and exports, and the value of the imports or exports must be equivalent to the amount of foreign exchange generated. Such imports and exports must comply with the terms and conditions prescribed in the circular.</p>
<h3>Installation of Fluorescent Lamps (Continued): Electricity Company Management Regulations</h3>
<p>— Wang Jingrong</p>
<p>Based on the examples mentioned above, the fairest transaction is when the quantity purchased equals the quantity delivered, that is, the ratio of the quantity purchased to the quantity delivered should be one hundred to one hundred. If this ratio is lower, it is abnormal and unfair. This ratio is commercially called the "commodity ratio" or "commodity factor," while in electricity, the ratio of the actual electricity consumed by electrical appliances to the electricity supplied by the generator is called the "power factor."</p>
<p>Usually, few commodities are sold with a low "commodity factor," that is, they are not sold in a "giving more, buying less" manner. We never buy two baskets of charcoal today and return one basket tomorrow, or buy several baskets again later and return part of them. The same is true when buying gasoline or gas. Why should the purchase and use of electricity be any different? However, many electrical appliances, such as fluorescent lamps, have a natural characteristic that when connected to a 50-cycle alternating current, whether we realize it or not, a pair of wires transmits a "packet" of electricity every hundredth of a second, and these appliances only use part of it and return the rest that is not needed. These appliances can be called "trial customers" of electricity. Therefore, the generating and feeding mechanisms of the electricity company increase unnecessary work due to the frequent return of current, just like a carpet store paying unnecessary transportation and labor costs due to the return of carpets. Moreover, there are many styles and sizes of carpets, and the "giving more, buying less" system is sometimes tolerated by reason. However, the quality of the electricity supplied by the electricity company is uniform, and the styles are the same. Therefore, the calculation of electricity prices does not include the cost of this useless service, nor is there any reason to include the cost of this useless service. If users of fluorescent lamps are allowed to enjoy this "giving more, buying less" (i.e., low power factor) right, the result will generally increase the electricity company's costs, which will affect the general electricity rate, and users who do not use fluorescent lamps will also be affected. This is another abnormal and unfair situation, which is unacceptable to fair users. Fortunately, the drawback of this low power factor is not an incurable disease. It can be corrected by using a device called a capacitor or condenser. Not only that, the effect of a capacitor is not only to eliminate unnecessary consumption but also to promote the economic efficiency of users. Its benefits to users are not limited to one aspect. The details are listed below: When users retrofit fluorescent lamps, if the "power factor" of the lamp has been corrected by a capacitor, the load on the wires is less, and more lamps can be installed without replacing the original wires, resulting in more light. If the same number of lamps are installed in a new installation, thinner wires can be used. A high power factor installation can reduce the current flow in the user's circuit, thus improving the voltage of the lamps and increasing the function of the lamps. The reduction of current in the circuit can reduce the power consumption loss after the circuit and save electricity bills. Twenty-watt and forty-watt lamps, when equipped with high power factor "dual lamp" ballasts, emit more light per unit of electricity than any other type of equipment. (The End)</p>
<h3>The Price-Controlled "Salvend" is Not Produced by Universal Drug Store</h3>
<p>We hereby acknowledge receipt of a letter from the Universal Drug Store, regarding the "List of Price-Controlled Items in the First Batch" published in your newspaper on the 19th of this month. In the column, the price of one tablet of "Salvend" Sulfolid produced by Schering Corporation and sold by G. Lie &amp; Company is 9 yuan and 45 cents for 15 tablets. Our company's registered trademark of 25 tablets is sold for only 3 yuan and 60 cents. This is not only easy to cause misunderstanding, but also related to our company's exclusive right to use the registered trademark, which is difficult to ignore. We have already written to the company to inquire about this. According to their reply, the (Sulphaui Iamide Tablets) produced by Schering Corporation are entirely in English on the packaging and do not have the Chinese characters for "Salvend." The meaning of the English words is also different. It is thought that the newspaper made a translation error, etc. This is consistent with the footnote at the end of your newspaper, which states that most of the Western medicines do not have Chinese names. However, the Chinese "Salvend" reported in the newspaper is actually mixed up with our company's products. We are writing to you accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and correct it.</p>

The details of the progress are recorded as follows to inform all sectors of society who care about the scholarship:</p>
<p>This Session's Scope Strives for Universality</p>
<p>Our newspaper has received letters from the generous donors of scholarships, such as the anonymous elderly and readers from all walks of life, asking whether the income and expenses of the previous semester can be offset, or urging us to start the second session, or expressing their willingness to generously assist, or donating free school places. We are deeply grateful for their concern. It has now been decided to continue the program immediately. However, considering the soaring prices recently, which are extremely different from a few months ago, it is certain that there will be even more young students who are in school, struggling with their finances, and finding it difficult to continue their studies than in the previous session. The only way is to make it clear to all sectors of society, deeply hoping to raise enough funds to allow the students who have already received assistance to continue their studies with peace of mind, and to assist those who have not received assistance and are about to drop out of school due to financial difficulties to return to school. In the future, these students will be cultivated by society and the public. After this period of hardship and diligence, they will surely repay society, and the donations of enthusiastic people from all walks of life will always be models for society.</p>
<p>Funds Will Not Be Wasted, We Will Handle Matters with Solemnity</p>
<p>The need for scholarships in this session is so urgent. We will definitely be more cautious in handling the scholarship matters in this session, striving to ensure that diligent students do not drop out of school and solemnly allocate the funds, ensuring that not a single penny is wasted, in order to thank all sectors for their generous donations. If readers sympathize and wish to donate, please send it directly to the Business Department of this newspaper for collection and obtain an official receipt. This newspaper will publish the names and amounts of all donors in each issue. Once this session is completed, the total income and expenditure will be published as usual for credibility.</p>

<h3>Yarn Market Only Knows How to Fight - Rises and Falls - What's the Point?</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn market advanced and retreated sharply, with a turbulent situation. Initially, it rose by 160 yuan, declaring a limit up, but then rumors spread, and the floating longs all emerged, suddenly plummeting by 200 yuan in an instant. This violent rise and fall led to some profits, but most suffered losses. It is said that one yarn company has already run aground. The highest price for 20-count Shuangma yarn approached 3,000 yuan, while the lowest price in the black market was 2,790 yuan. In the afternoon, the yarn market declared a limit up after rising to 1,950 yuan in the morning. The exchange temporarily suspended trading to collect margin payments. Trading will resume as usual today. However, at the opening of the exchange, both yarn and cloth showed signs of weakness.</p>
<p>Due to the tense closing situation the previous day, Shuangma opened in the morning with a jump of 90 yuan to 1,880 yuan. However, as soon as this transaction opened, the market situation became turbulent, and it fell slightly to 1,850 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that the exchange's opening of yarn and cloth jumped by more than 100 yuan, and the market suddenly ran wildly, soaring to 2,550 yuan, declaring a limit up. However, the highest price outside the market reached 2,990 yuan to 3,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, at the close of the third transaction, the exchange suddenly fell due to negative news. Floating longs rushed to exit, and the black market plunged to 2,790 yuan. Statistics show that 1,400 bales were traded in half a day.</p>
<p>The futures market for Jin Shuangma experienced a rise, fall, and then a rebound. The market was initially quite strong in the morning. The opening price for November was 2,700 yuan, followed by a rise of 80 yuan. December opened at 2,830 yuan, up 60 yuan. The situation still appeared stable. Shorts were eager to cover, and buyers were firm. The prices of the first two months continued to rise. Later, rumors spread that international negotiations were temporarily suspended, and people's hearts began to fluctuate. Longs were unable to support the market and emerged again. As a result, the opening price for January was lowered by 30 yuan to 1,840 yuan. Subsequently, prices continued to fall and lacked any distinctive features. In the afternoon, due to the limit up of factory orders in the morning, the black market declined sharply, and people's hearts were filled with panic. Large and small investors scrambled to sell, and the selling pressure on the trading floor was strong. Prices for each month fell one after another. The November contract fell to as low as 2,480 yuan, the December contract fell to 2,610 yuan, and the January contract fell to 2,740 yuan at one point. Although prices rebounded slightly later, the near-term contracts ended up with a small rebound of 80 yuan, while the December contract fell by 100 yuan, and the January contract also fell by 110 yuan. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>November December January</p>
<p>Opening 2700.0 2830.0 2840.0</p>
<p>Highest 2780.0 2850.0 2880.0</p>
<p>Lowest 2480.0 2610.0 2740.0</p>
<p>Closing 2540.0 2670.0 2760.0</p>
<p>Change Down 80.0 Down 100.0 Down 110.0</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton on Hold</h3>
<p>The spot cotton market was quite expensive in the morning due to the rise in the yarn market. Near noon, the market stopped, as the international situation became chaotic and the yarn price plummeted.</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 20 bales 230.0</p>
<p>#2 Family Cotton 150 bales 120.0</p>
<p>Lan Gong Cotton 100 bales 644.0</p>
<p>Again 100 bales 6 -.-.0</p>
<p>Again 100 bales 625.0</p>
<p>Again 100 bales 620.0</p>
<p>Again</p>
<p>The New York cotton market was unstable and varied. Prices rose initially due to buying by the industry and spot traders, followed by a decline due to selling by hedging parties and long liquidations. The close of the market was up two to twelve points, depending on futures.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market initially declined due to selling by spot traders, but then rebounded due to short covering and buying by European exporters. Closing prices were up or down one or two rupees. It is predicted that the opening of the market today will be down slightly by 0.25 rupees.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Finally Plummets</h3>
<p>The market for factory-produced cloth saw a sharp rise at the opening yesterday morning, but then quickly plummeted. In the afternoon, the market gradually stabilized. Sixteen-pound Huadie coarse cloth reached a high of 114.5 yuan, a sharp jump of nearly 10 yuan compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, the price first fell back to 99 yuan, and at the close of the market, it was difficult to buy at 101 yuan. As a result, some white coarse and fine cloths fell by 2 to 4 yuan per bolt. Bleached and dyed cloths were flat. Yihe Factory opened with 200 boxes of Golden Pagoda bleached cloth, priced at 110 yuan. The street traded more than 600 pieces of various cloths. Sales to the occupied areas were relatively strong.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth initially saw a continuation of the rising trend due to the soaring price of yarn. Subsequently, negative rumors led to a straight-line plunge. People's hearts were confused and unable to grasp the situation, resulting in a chaotic situation. The Caiqiu Biao cloth at the exchange opened with a rise of 8 or 9 yuan, but the afternoon opening was down 3 yuan compared to the previous day. The closing price rebounded by 1 or 2 yuan. As a result, the current month closed at 91 yuan, down 3.5 yuan; December closed at 94.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan; and January closed at 97 yuan, unchanged from the previous day. However, the spot market unanimously declined at the close of trading. The leading fine cloth factory orders were at 99.5 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge was at 3.625 yuan.</p>
<h3>Black Market Transfers - More Flexibility Reported</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in the official rates of the Central Bank and HSBC. The small counter rates of HSBC and other banks were flat. The black market rates for British and American currencies saw a slight expansion. It is rumored that a small number of foreign exchange banks in this city are willing to provide transfer services, but the handling fee is extremely high. Chinese merchants were eager to sell their remaining long positions in American dollars at 2.25 and 3.375 yuan, but there were no consultants. The market trend was loose and cheap, resulting in a lack of imports and no need for foreign firms. Compared to the previous two days, the British were at 2.25 and the Americans were at 3.75. According to unconfirmed rumors, import firms are settling American dollars at 3.75 yuan, while there are still few buyers for foreign exchange transfers between foreign firms importing and exporting in the United States.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds fall by 20 yuan along with the cash price. British gold notes remained unchanged. American gold notes rose to as high as 34.3 yuan in the morning, but then fell back, ending at 33 yuan, down 0.4 yuan compared to the previous day.

Japanese gold notes and Korean notes were slightly weaker, with the former retreating to 3.3 yuan and the latter falling to 3.2 yuan.</p>

<h3>Gold Prices Plummet - Approaching the 18,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold black market saw an initial rise followed by a sudden and dramatic drop, returning to the 19,000 yuan mark. At one point, it even fell to the 18,000 yuan mark. The mood of all parties shifted abruptly from firm to weak. Around 10:00, news suddenly spread that Japan had softened in US-Japan negotiations, causing a certain atmosphere. Although banks tried to prop up the market, with Da Feng buying 770 taels and Ming Feng buying 580 taels, merchant firms sold 490 taels through Xiang, Xingyong. Xianghe, Shunyuan, and Decheng sold more than 200 taels each. Selling pressure shifted from weak to strong, causing the price to rise to 19,950 yuan and then immediately reverse and plummet. In the afternoon, the price retreated to a low of 18,050 yuan, a drop of 1,900 yuan. As a result, there was some buying activity at the low, briefly pushing the price up by 850 yuan. However, with sentiment still pointing downward, the price fell again, closing down 1,180 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 16,140 taels. The price of gold ornaments fell by 110 yuan to 1,870 yuan.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Rises and Falls Sharply</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, the price per bar (10 taels) initially carried the momentum of the previous day and remained firm. The opening price at 9:00 had risen to 19,700 yuan, 170 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. Suddenly, Tianyuan, Shihe, and Zhongxing came to sell, and the price retreated slightly to 19,550 yuan. Defu, Dafeng, Mingfeng, and Decheng scrambled to support the market, and the price gradually rose by 400 yuan. Before 10:00, rumors suddenly arose, and buyers poured in. Xiangxingyong, Xianghe, Decheng, Shunyuan, Shihe, Yongcheng, Tianyuan, and Yifeng aggressively sold off, and the market price fell sharply, entering the 19,000 yuan range, a drop of 1,550 yuan, reaching a low of 18,400 yuan.

The price changed as many as eight times in one day, down 110 yuan, with a deduction of 150 yuan for purchases. Silver bullion remained at 26 yuan, with the black market at 23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Sit and Watch the Wind - Foreign Shares Spin Downward</h3>
<p>The black market for public bonds changed very quickly yesterday. It fell sharply by more than one yuan in the morning and then rose sharply by more than one yuan in the afternoon. The reason for the decline was mainly the news that the US-Japan talks had stalled. There were too many long positions in the market, leading to a sharp drop. In the afternoon, fresh forces of longs suddenly raised the price, and Class C bonds suddenly broke through the 70 yuan mark. This kind of artificial manipulation cannot last for long, so the closing price remained within the mark. In short, until any news about the US-Japan talks is revealed, neither bullish nor bearish views can be criticized. Therefore, at the slightest price increase, the general blind followers are most easily deceived, and vice versa. Therefore, the market price is not yet on the right track at this time. As for the rumors in this port, they have not subsided but have not been confirmed. In this uncertain and restless situation, it is difficult to make a judgment because it is difficult to predict future rises and falls. Tongyi continued to buy in the morning, and Tongkang also showed interest. Class C initially opened at 9.45 yuan, but as Jiufeng, Tongshun, Dingkang, Runde, and Shengyi increasingly sold off, the market was unable to support the price and broke below 9 yuan, later seeing a small price of 8.4 yuan. The noon close rebounded slightly, but the trend gradually weakened. In the afternoon, Tongyi resumed its buying interest, and Class C bonds suddenly rushed out of the 70 yuan mark, opening at 70.01 yuan. For a time, the market's blind followers thought there was good news and bought in droves. Datong, Hongda, and Runde all bought in, but Tongshun and Jiufeng continued to sell off as always. Lianhe and Yitai were also eager to sell. Class C bonds at 70 yuan ultimately failed to hold their ground. The market price resulted in all bonds, except Class D, being slightly lower by 0.05 yuan, while the rest were good by 0.05 to 0.4 yuan. The transaction volume was approximately 2.5 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Class A 76.60 75.00 76.30 Up 0.40</p>
<p>Class B 72.00 70.00 71.45 Up 0.05</p>
<p>Class C 70.30 68.40 69.90 Up 0.15</p>
<p>Class D 65.60 64.80 65.50 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Class E 69.40 67.80 69.30 Up 0.05</p>
<p>Fifty shares of Commercial Press stock were traded at a price of 265 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The public industry stock market remained quiet, and prices rose and fell without fixed rules. The morning opening was very strong. Yihua Yarn Factory, Steel Industry, and others rose by 3 or 4 yuan. After a period of stability, the market finally fell back down. Only steel industry stocks remained at the edge of high prices, and the remaining closing prices did not differ greatly from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stagnation Does Not Hinder - Foreign Flour Also Without Market</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market remained stagnant yesterday, with both foreign and domestic rice in short supply. The foreign rice market may come to an end, thus reducing the manipulation of speculators and hoarders. As for the people's food supply, although domestic rice is not reliable, the工部局 Hong Kong rice has increased due to increased foreign exchange, and the 650,000 bags of low-priced goods will be sold publicly, which will inevitably further reduce the public sales price and provide the people with real benefits.</p>
<p>The flour market was also stagnant. American Camp flour completely lacked a market. After the Cereal Association resumed its afternoon meetings the other day, the 久靜思之 people who were active in speculative activities resumed their activities. The goods side became attractive, and blind followers rose up. The market price rose by 2 or 3 yuan. Just as foreign rice was about to be suppressed, the flour has yet to be realized. 客運 was blocked, and the actual cancellation was small. The flour market seemed to be settled, but after speculative hoarding, the market immediately became abnormal. Yesterday, speculation slightly reduced, and those holding goods were reluctant to sell. However, large households were still optimistic because the 平 flour had not arrived. Therefore, it was difficult for the out-of-market price to loosen. Jinlong Bank栈 even had a call price of 423 yuan. Wheat lacked a market, and bran small bags rose to 56 yuan. Orchid guest bran opened at 54 yuan, and buyers waited and watched. The market will be weak in the future.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains, Oils, and Beans Slightly Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's speculative trading of edible oil slightly decreased, and market prices have turned flat. As for soybeans, the goods owner sold a few 稍暢, and the price rose by 2 or 3 yuan. Corn initially rose and then fell back. As a result, the spot price was still flat, and the futures price rose by 2 or 3 yuan. The total market sold 20 barrels of Qingdao 生 oil, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, 200 dan of Dayou Factory 清油, and 100 dan of rapeseed oil. Rihua Factory sold 100 barrels of rapeseed oil, and Chuannan Factory sold 100 dan of rapeseed oil. Tianjin Chen Jinyuan sold 200 bags, Xin Jinyuan sold 600 bags, and Xinqing bean sold 300 bags. Qingkou and Guide soybean sold 500 bags, and spot corn sold 2,000 bags and 400 tons of futures.</p>
<h3>Sugar Futures Delivery Suspended, Spot Trading Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was temporarily suspended due to the联营公司 delivering futures. As a result, trading was quiet. Spot prices saw mixed rises and falls. For example, #24 coarse white sugar for October and November initially opened at 272 yuan to 275 yuan, but remained at 272 yuan in the afternoon, only slightly higher by 0.3 yuan. The trend was quite stable. Tai B mark was 244 yuan to 247 yuan, up 22 yuan. DY mark was 228 yuan, up 8 yuan. HX mark was 225 yuan to 222 yuan. The result was up 2 yuan. Hong Kong coarse sugar was 230 yuan, down 2 yuan. Dutch red was 210 yuan to 213 yuan, but finally ended at 208 yuan, up 3 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was only more than 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Beware of Shortage in Lake Lotus</h3>
<p>There has been a long shortage of Lake Lotus. The bottom reserves have been sold through. However, there are recently 40 pieces, and the color of the goods is good. It is heard that Baochangxing has opened all the進, and the price is 290 yuan. However, the cost of the劃 is already inverted, so there is a fear that there will be a shortage in the future.</p>
<h3>Hardware Market Lingers</h3>
<p>The hardware market is showing a state of hesitation. Prices are too high, and sales are sluggish. However, the overseas supply is not continuous, and the bottom reserves in this port are limited. Therefore, the trend of the market is not falling. Black iron billets are also no exception. Yesterday, it still lingered around 10,000 yuan per bundle.</p>
<p>Due to the early interruption of美會司 iron, the only way to meet the market demand is to 僅木街存貨, and the difficulty in purchasing a large number of products is becoming increasingly difficult. Yesterday, each box opened at 1,350 yuan,</p>

<h3>Please Pay Attention to the Residents' Housing</h3>
<p>— Mu Chang</p>
<p>Since the工部局 has managed prices, everything has been good, and the citizens have benefited greatly. Under the threat of rising prices, they can finally breathe a sigh of relief. Li De'er, the chief minister of the工部局, said it well: "The Equalization Association has shown sympathetic attention to supplying Shanghai with the main items, so the public can rest assured... The Equalization Association does not intend to supply foreign exchange for luxury goods, but the工部局 is confident that the Association will be able to supply foreign exchange for all the items necessary for the lives of Chinese and foreign residents in this port." The first batch of item price limits has been announced, and the second batch will be announced next week. The residents are deeply looking forward to it because of the urgent need for life. People in general have not had any contact with luxury goods for a long time, what they need are the minimum and indispensable items for their life.</p>
<p>The authorities first lowered its giant hammer for food; then, step by step, they continued to limit the prices of necessities, and their steps can be said to be essential. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the necessities of life, and food is especially important, but housing is also in a major position. Therefore, in this occasion, it is not too much to propose the serious housing problem in Shanghai in order to seek a reasonable solution.</p>
<p>The citizens have been suffering from the "housing" problem for a long time. It can be said that it is painful to talk about it. The big landlords and the second landlords are in charge, and the third-rate tenants are the most miserable oppressed. This journal published their voices a few days ago, and if you don't think it is miserable and serious, then this person is a superman.</p>
<p>If you have several buildings of your own, you can hoard all the goods just like the National Army rice. Wherever there is profit, you will spare no effort to scrape the tenants' heads in various ways. Prices fall due to restrictions, but rents have soared, and things have been smooth sailing, 40% and then 50%, which is a geometric progression. As long as a written or oral notice is issued, the tenants have to obey. There are even various tricks of "selling houses separately," "the contract expires," "the property rights are transferred," and "foreign exchange settlement" to make people get into their traps. The second landlords take advantage of the situation and intensify their efforts. If others increase the rent by 50%, they will increase it by 60% or 70%, and the utility bills will also have to be added. They enjoy their profits by playing the tiger's skin. Of course, not all of them are crows, but how many people can have legitimate reasons to calculate and apportion in proportion? Moreover, for the sake of "necessity," the second landlord's wife is also a tigress. Whether you like it or not, you have to laugh and cry and be under her jurisdiction. Walking under her eaves, you have no choice but to bow your head. In the pavilions and in the kitchen rooms, the tenants in the upper floors mostly endure their anger in order to calm things down, so the landlords' power has grown even more.</p>
<p>Years ago, when the National Army was stationed, it abolished small rents and restricted rents in order to benefit the people; after the war, the authorities in the concession also published a draft of the rental regulations to kill the fierce flame; unfortunately, the latter was discussed but not implemented, and had no impact. Recently, lowering electricity fees and land taxes was a good phenomenon, but it was a good opportunity for the landlords to "吞," and the third-rate tenants did not benefit from it.</p>
<p>"Low palace rooms and do our best in the ditches," "Virtue is not alone, there must be neighbors," I hope that the concession authorities will have the same serious expression on the housing problem of the citizens as on the prices of daily necessities, then the beneficiaries will not only be two or three people.</p>
<h3>Solving Shanghai's Severe Housing Problem: Hoping for the Swift Formation of a "Rent Evaluation Committee"</h3>
<p>— A Citizen</p>
<p>Before the war, renting a house from a major landlord cost about 40 to 50 yuan for a larger one, and about 20 to 30 yuan for a smaller one. Now, major landlords are increasing rents for secondary landlords, but perhaps not as frequently as secondary landlords increase rents for tertiary tenants, which, when added up, should not exceed double the pre-war price. Now, secondary landlords, renting houses for several tens of yuan each, sublet them to tertiary tenants, earning ten to twenty times more in rent. They don't even pay rent for their own housing. Currently, the desires of secondary landlords are increasing daily, blaming rent increases by major landlords, water price hikes, electricity price increases, etc., using all sorts of excuses to raise prices in disguise. This is because the price increases are not proportional to the increased costs.</p>
<p>In light of the soaring prices, the two concessions have taken measures to control prices, especially selling foreign rice at a fixed price, which has greatly benefited ordinary people and had a deterrent effect on profiteers. However, these tangible profiteers are easily detected by the authorities, while the poisonous flames of secondary landlords are deeply hidden in every corner, with over 90% of people feeling their pain! Now, we are issuing a weak call, hoping to achieve the greatest effect, urging the authorities of the two concessions to jointly suppress these intangible housing profiteers. (Editor's Note: The French Concession authorities previously published a draft rental charter, but it was never implemented.)</p>
<p>Recently, foreign residents in Shanghai have made suggestions to deal with major landlords raising rents, and some Chinese even suggested forming a tertiary tenant union, but none of these have materialized. Now, we ask the authorities of the two concessions to relieve the suffering of millions of citizens by quickly establishing a "Temporary Rent Evaluation Committee." Its nature is temporary, and the final executing body should still be the courts.</p>
<p>Regarding the structure of the "Temporary Rent Evaluation Committee," the income of secondary landlords from subletting should not exceed double their cost (including the proportion of their own residence). (Editor's Note: This proposal is extremely moderate.) The committee's procedures should be that it does not act without a complaint, handles everything by order, and asks the courts to enforce it. Conduct housing surveys to prevent useful housing from being left vacant due to rent reductions, forcing it to be rented out. If a tertiary tenant complains to the committee about rent reductions or preventing rent increases and eviction, the committee should immediately investigate, conduct a fair evaluation, and if the party is not satisfied, send it to the courts for enforcement. Major landlords who want to increase rent must also obtain the approval of the evaluation committee.</p>
<p>The above measures are just a principle. As for detailed, beneficial, legal, customary, and factual regulations for tertiary tenants, we hope that the authorities will accept, adopt, and implement them, which will definitely achieve our expected goal of solving the most severe housing problem in Shanghai today. We are all sincerely praying for it. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>How to Prevent Tuberculosis in Infants and Toddlers</h3>
<p>— Di Qing</p>
<p>In addition to protecting body temperature, clothing should be as light as possible. Overly warm cotton wool, flannel, and similar materials are not necessarily good, as these clothes can hinder a child's respiratory function.</p>
<p>Breastfeeding: In the first few months of a child's life, breastfeeding by a healthy mother is the most important and beneficial. If the mother has tuberculosis, she is not suitable for breastfeeding. To avoid the mother's cough and saliva transmitting the disease, it is naturally appropriate to hire a healthy wet nurse.</p>
<p>For breastfed babies, milk or milk powder should always be the main food every day. Gradually introduce rice cereal or other foods. It is also necessary to regularly drink orange juice, and a small amount of cod liver oil daily can enhance their resistance to germs.</p>
<p>Children often dislike eating vegetables, which is a pity. Because fresh vegetables, lettuce, and carrots, etc., contain extremely valuable protective substances. In particular, foods that mix delicious fruits and vegetables are most beneficial. A pint of milk a day is also essential. However, it must be tuberculosis-tested or pasteurized before being consumed regularly. White cheese, cottage cheese, and milk biscuits made from clean milk are also extremely beneficial.</p>
<p>When infectious diseases such as measles and whooping cough occur, children must undergo strict physical examinations. Some people often say, "Measles are inevitable for children. It's best to have had it before starting school." This is a big mistake. Older children who get measles have a milder case than infants. Therefore, we should do our best to protect children from contracting these diseases. After contracting these diseases, we should pay close attention to care. Because during the recovery period from measles, there is the greatest risk of tuberculosis starting.</p>
<p>After starting school: Nowadays, most children go to kindergarten from a young age, and even children under the age of five go to kindergarten classes. Kindergarten classes are often outdoors and have long periods of rest every day.</p>
<p>During this period, or send them to the Welfare Clinic, where the doctor will tell you what special nutritional attention the child should pay, dietary clothing and any special difficulties. This opportunity can fully understand how toddlers can get sick, how can they be cured quickly without wasting time.</p>
<p>The severity of tuberculosis in young children is lower than that in older children, but the germs can lurk at this time. It is best to examine them early, diagnose them by a doctor, and prevent or treat them early.</p>
<p>If there are symptoms of particularly poor health, of course, you should consult a doctor or go to the Welfare Clinic for examination. Enlarged neck glands, fever, pale complexion, or loss of appetite all indicate that special examination should be given, and do not be careless. (End)</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Fourteen: The Life of a Hero</p>
<p>"Look at you, you really look pitiful, but tonight is too unlucky, two people have already taken leave, if you want to rest, you can only wait until tomorrow!" He took a felt hat off the wall and put it on his head, and then said a particularly kind word. "Since that's the case, when it's time to turn over the tiger boat, you don't have to go up!"</p>
<p>This was certainly a great favor.</p>
<p>Begonia nodded repeatedly, but couldn't help coughing violently.</p>
<p>For the past few days, he himself didn't know why, it wasn't cold, and he hadn't been exposed to the cold at night, but suddenly he started coughing; and he coughed very badly. When he returned from the theater at night, as soon as his head hit the pillow, he couldn't breathe, and he had to cough for at least half an hour before he could barely fall asleep. But when he slept until eight or nine in the morning, he was awakened by the turbid air suffocating in his bronchial tubes, which made him cough so much that he couldn't lie in bed. No matter how tired he was, he couldn't struggle to get up.</p>
<p>"Dad, you should see a doctor!" Mei Bao had told him this several times. And she had also listened to the guidance of other residents, making her father almond milk soup and rock sugar stewed pears, etc., cough medicines, but Begonia ate them, and they had no effect. (268)</p>

<p>The Entertainment World</p>
<h3>The Ancestor of Motion Pictures</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>Undeniably, motion pictures are the most developed form of drama in the entertainment world of the 20th century. People probably all know that this was invented by foreigners! But who knows that shadow plays already existed in our country during the Northern Song Dynasty? (See Meng Yuanlao's "Tokyo Dream Record" and Wu Zimu's "Dream Liang Record" from the Southern Song Dynasty.)</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Jiegang once wrote an article on Australian shadow plays, and Mr. Jiang Danian also wanted to write a book on Changqiao shadow plays. They all wanted to promote and enhance China's inherent art and culture. I dare not have any such dreams, I just want to write about some of the interesting things about the shadow plays of our ancient times—which can also be said to be the ancestors of shadow plays—for people who like to study shadow plays to refer to.</p>
<p>Westerners say that shadow plays evolved from zoetropes, which is not without reason. Our ancient shadow plays were invented using the principle of the zoetrope.</p>
<p>The most important part of ancient shadow plays was a donkey's skin, which was ground very thin, almost transparent. People, horses, dogs... were painted on the skin, which was considered the negative. Behind the skin was a very bright oil lamp—although not as bright as the thousands of light electric lamps of today, it was similar to a hundred-light lamp. About ten feet away from the donkey skin, a white cloth screen was hung, which was the so-called silver screen. In this way, the paintings on the donkey skin would be reflected on the white screen, and the donkey skin could be moved, so the images on the screen would also move. This seems similar to modern cartoons; really, it's almost the same!</p>
<p>Moreover, this kind of shadow play also had sound. There was a singer who stood next to the screen and sang or spoke according to the characters in the play (male, female, painted face, clown).</p>
<p>If you think what I'm saying is too absurd, then I can tell you that the British Museum in London still displays the donkey skin and oil lamps used to make shadow plays in our country during the Northern Song Dynasty..., but it seems that Chinese museums do not have this kind of antique.</p>
<h3>Yan Jun and Mei Cun: A Balance of Strength and Softness</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Well-known actors Yan Jun and Mei Cun held their wedding ceremony on the 18th of this month at D.D.S. The witnesses were lawyer Wang Hongmo and famous director Wang Zuolin. The ceremony was solemn and simple, truly worthy of emulation by those who follow. It is now scheduled to host a banquet at the Hatton Building at 5:00 p.m. today (the 21st), with guests mostly cultural figures and theater workers. There will be a grand occasion. Based on what I know, I will briefly discuss the history of Yan and Mei below:</p>
<p>Yan Jun, originally named Yan Zongqi, is more stubborn in nature. He is a progressive artist with integrity. He has been in Shanghai from the north for several years. Among today's Shanghai drama actors, he can be considered a veteran. After performing in the two dramas "Wu Sangui" and "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom," his acting skills won unanimous praise, and the name Yan Jun was deeply rooted in the minds of every audience. From the Fifth Master in "Home" and Commissioner Yang in "Border Town Story," we know that he can play various different personalities. He is honest, his mother was originally in Tianjin, and she has recently been brought to Shanghai. He is very filial. He is also very affectionate to his younger siblings. He does not have all the bad habits of "so-called artists" nowadays. Indeed, Yan Jun is an artist worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>Mei Cun is famous for playing strange flower roles. However, his original attitude to people is not strange at all, the word "gentle" can represent her personality. She and Yan Jun have known and loved each other for several years, it is by no means a blitzkrieg tactic. Her personality is gentle and Yan Jun's temperament is just stubborn. Using gentleness to overcome strength, or in other words, balancing leniency and strictness, I think their future happiness is solid and unlimited. Finally, we hope that they will continue to work hard as always and not let us down!</p>
<h3>Blood Rain and Jade Flowers</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 19: Dusk: Nomadic Cavalry Fill the City with Dust</p>
<p>Li Chuang allowed him to go into battle, and taught Li Yan and other four generals to chase straight after them, wanting to stir up the flow of the bandit's formation, so that he could show off his bravery. But he saw many more bandit generals coming towards him, and the one sitting on horseback at the front was Liu Zongmin, with a broadsword across his hands, shouting loudly. Zhang Cangqiu laughed wildly, his sword like a long rainbow, his horse like a swimming dragon, and went straight for Liu Zongmin. But Liu Zongmin's sword was also not weak, and he cheered up his spirit and fought Zhang Cangqiu fiercely. Li Yan came to help, and Chen Qiu fought with him. The bandit generals saw that the two were extremely brave and feared that Liu and Li would be frustrated, so everyone raised their weapons and went forward to help. Chen Cangqiu and Chen Fei fought bravely and did not retreat at all. Xu Jing and Liu Yinying, under Bai Xianzong's military banner, watched from afar as Zhang Cangqiu and others were killing generals and showing off their abilities on the battlefield, and they were extremely excited. They immediately asked Bai Xianzong for orders, and then led hundreds of cavalrymen to charge into Li Chuang's formation. Xu Jing was riding a silver-maned horse and wielding a gleaming silver spear. Liu Yinying was riding a jujube-colored horse and wielding a pear blossom ancient spear. When they reached the front of the formation, Li Chuang ordered the bandit general Fan Damaizi and others to go forward to meet them. Xu Jing saw the bandits on the opposite side and was eager to make a contribution, so he rushed forward. Fan Damaizi waved the double hammers in his hand and fought fiercely with Xu Jing. Liu Yinying galloped forward, took a gap, and thrust out with his spear, and Fan Damaizi had already fallen off his horse. At this time, Zhang Cangqiu had already killed a bandit general. Wu Sangui was overjoyed to see them so brave. The generals such as Chai Ying saw this and were eager to try. (224)</p>
