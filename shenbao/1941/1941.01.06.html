<h3>迎劃時代的新年</h3>
<p>— 孫科</p>
<p>孫院長此文，專就中國與美蘇日之國際關係，加以分析，並斷定民國三十年將為中國及太平洋歷史劃一新時代，此新時代即中國對日戰爭之最後勝利，太平洋問題之澈底解決，證之於理，證之於勢，證之於歷史，言簡意賅，發人深省，航寄遲到，特為補刊。</p>
<p>今日為中華民國三十年兀旦吉日，亦我對日作戰，勝敗之局，業已大定之時，以吾人誰測，民國三十年，將為中國及太平洋歷史，劃一新時代，此新時代，即中國對日戰爭之最後勝利，太平洋問題之澈底解決是也。</p>
<p>必待中國作戰最後勝利，然後太平洋問題，始能為合理之解決，此為理，勢，歷史所必然，吾人深信不疑者。蓋所謂太平洋問題，實即日本獨羈東亞，所由引起之問題而已。</p>
<p>過去日本自明治維新（一八六八）以後，模倣歐美，力圖富强，而中國則因淸廷昏庸腐朽，日趨衰敗，朝鮮，台灣，琉球先後被日併奪，而滿淸莫之能禦，自甲午而後，日本繼於一九〇五年，再戰而勝帝俄，至是而太乎洋國際之均衡破碎，日圖亡我益亟。當第一决歐戰時，日向袁世凱提出要求二十一條件，已盡露其侵略野心。華盛頓會議，九國合約以制日，其效雖見於一時，而日愈益謀所以獨占中國之道後二年，田中組閣，密奏滿蒙積極政策，公然以征服中國為征服世界之始基，翌年而「五三」慘案以發，父二年，「九一八」而日占東三省，後五年，而「七七」爆發，太平洋大局，破壞無餘，由是觀之，近百年來所謂太平洋問題，無一而非以日本圖獨覇為其中心，故欲求太平洋問題之解決，必須求其正本淸源之道，始克有濟。</p>
<p>正本淸源者何，中國奮起作戰，以求得最後勝利是矣。溯自七七」以後，我國為維持國家之獨立，民挨之生存，並為恢復太平洋之和平計，一本三民主義偉大之指示，領袖精誠之感召，於「八一三」掀起全國長期作戰之局，滬戰三月，日軍驕橫以挫，首都淪陷，而我不為城下之盟，武漢轉進，日軍且陷足泥淖，不能自拔，相持三載，耗日本戰費六百萬萬兀之巨，傷亡日軍一百五六十萬之衆，而日軍困阻猶未稍解，曠世各國，莫不一改其畏日之心理，轉移目光，以注視中華民族之復興，及乎歐戰法敗，日軍亟於投機南進，心力愈趨分散，三國同盟，而美英合力援我，制日之局已成，日近復以媚蘇失敗，求和無門，乃於徬徨失措，窮途末路之中，玩弄舊文章，與在簽訂「私的約」</p>
<p>反顧我國，則正與日相反，以言乎內，則軍事·政治·經濟。均有長足之發展。前後方民衆，其作戰到底之意志，隨戰事之持久，而愈益堅强。人人均以捍衛國家，以犧牲一己之生命，維持民族之生命為天職。數千年來，潛蘊之民族精社，日以昌明，三民主義之共信，益趨堅定。以言乎外，則國際之同情與援助，因國際情勢之變化日趨積極。三國同盟以後，美國不獨不為日本虛聲所恫嚇，其援助我制日之步驟，反而切實積極。軍備之充實，國防之增强，外交之成功，在在均以因日制日為目的，其繼統貸我美金一萬萬兀，更為積極助我之直接表示。英國自滇緬緬路重開以後。其遠束政策與行動，允與美國完全一致，至於蘇聯，則始終堅持一其貫援我之立塲，戳破日人拉攏透謠之毒計。其余環繞太平洋而生存之民族，則均翹首仰望中國之早日勝利，今日遠東國際間，對我有利之情勢，實為三年來所未有。日果再南進，則美英必將予以實力之打擊，此事勢之必然趨向也。</p>
<p>如此時會，誠千載一時之機，吾人允宜為反守為攻之戰，則最後勝利之日，必將臨於吾人之眼前，而太平洋問題，始得迎刃而解，願吾同胞，懍於責任之重大，萬眾一心，齊其步伐，以迎此作戰勝利國家復興之新時代，罄香禱祝之！</p>
<h3>吳開先講　「迎取勝利年」</h3>
<p>重慶　今日下午六時三十分、國際廣播電台、邀請中央組織部副部長吳開先氏、在此問用親密之鄉音、對上海各界演講、題為「迎取勝利年」、全文如下、全上海諸位父老、諸位同胞、今天是中華民國三十年的初四、雖然離元旦巳經三天、但我還得向諸位恭賀新禧、作戰以前、兄弟在職務上會和諸位發生過密切的關係、戰事發生以後、兄弟雖曾一時離開了上海、但在最近一年半中、兄弟父襲諸位恢復了過去的關係、所以今天向諸位賀年、是有特別深切的感覺、因為兄弟不但耳聞、而且目暏自從國軍退出上海以後三年半來、諸位在這所謂孤島的上海、為了擁護國策、為了擁護領袖、為了保全個人的人格、為了保全民族的正氣、挺身與惡劣的環境周旋、奮鬥、不為威屈、不為利誘、諸位這種精神。眞可以動天地、泣鬼神、兄弟每决把這些可泣可歌的奮鬥事實、拿來報告後方人士的時候、他們對於諸位、無不表示極大的敬意、所以兄弟今天不但要向諸位賀年、並且代表後方人士、向諸位致敬、諸位因為身居孤島、愛國的情緒、特別熱烈、對於最後勝利的期待、亦更殷切、現在兄弟可以告訴諸位一個好消息、就是中華民國三十年、就是我們作戰的勝利年、這並不是我們主觀的希望、當是客觀的事實、今日中國目前軍事，財政、以及國際環境、早幾天杜月笙先生巳經向諸位說過、而中央各主管長官在元旦日對我全國同胞的報告中、說得尤其剴切详盡、這些情形、我想諸位都已知道、兄弟不想多化諸位寳貴的時間來重述、兄弟擬想總括的說一句、我們自從作戰到現在、不論軍事、財政、以及國際環境從沒有比目前更有利的了、（四日電待續）</p>

<h3>遠東局勢的展望</h3>
<p>一九四一年是淸算年，是勝利年，這是世界最大多數人類共同具有的信念，而在遠東方面，其形勢與意義却表現得更為異常深刻而明顯。溯自十年前的九一八事變打破了太平洋的安髯和均勢，遠東大局便一步步進入了昏沉黑暗之中；條的與正義，生命和物資，無不遭受空前浩劫。中國的孤軍奮戰，其間，直接是為了自身抗建大業的完成，間接是謀恢復原有的安髯和秩序；乃為彼時整個在逆轉中的國際形勢所累，未能獲得並世列强充分的鼓勵和支援，以速竟其全功。直到去歲秋冬之交，世界全局達到阢隍的頂點，世人始認識了中國獨力支撑這一危局的重大意義；而意在乘人之危以便遂其貪慾的侵略者，亦復因國際分野轉趨顯明而無所逃形。，自此以往，將近十年的遠東危局纔達到一個新的轉捩點：中國獲收得道多助的功効，日本則屆近不義自斃的關頭；因此，凡如美國遠東政策與援華的空前堅强，英美間對於遠東立塲之漸趨一致，以至德國攻英企圖的挫逆，義大利對英希作戰的敗北，都在遠東局勢演變方面，發揮了積極或消極的重大作用。十年來的陰翳面，到最近纔透露出新的曙光，無論政治軍事經濟外交，反侵略者處境的佳良，無不與侵略者運用的支絀形成非常明顯的對比，令人感到無限快慰。從而可見所謂剝復相生，物極必反，原來似乎祗是哲理範疇之內的推論，而現在體驗之於事實方面，也見得是不易的眞理。</p>
<p>日前各國當局的歲首獻詞，無不充滿了樂觀的自信：如中國領袖勗勉軍民努力完成建國大業的文告，固然令人感奮，即如納粹德國漸入逆境之中，猶復作勝利的誇張亦殊不失日爾曼民族强毅的本色；只有日本外相松岡的元旦演說，吞吐其詞，獨持悲觀論調；相形之下，雖不能驟即斷為空虛幻滅的供狀，至低限度，也是困阻交迫之下，不期然而然的一種哀音。但另一方面，無論他那種悲觀看法的本意是仍在希望美日關係的改進，還是認為美日接近已成絕望，他却始終還堅持其所謂「新秩序」以至「天然願望」一類的老調；換句話說，也就是日當局面臨了軍事外交種種失敗，對內對外無數難關，明知前途沒有倖而獲逞的可能，却依舊低徊其一貫的擴展侵略的迷夢。而日來所紛傳的軸心未來的春季攻勢，恐怕就是日閥所最後期待着的一個嘗試。其實大勢所趨，任何一個旁觀者倘若對於未來國際趨勢作一明確展望，都不難認定軸心方面的衰頹和不利，絕非等閒冒險的孤注一擲所能挽回。而日本之與德義，前者固然切盼歐方戰爭形勢利於德義，俾使美國注意力轉移到大西洋；後者又何嘗不希望日本在太干洋有所發動，庶幾减輕美方對英的支援。這種彼此不能把握的意願，終將怎樣加工湊合，尚難逆覩；而最近在太平洋上發現的剽襲行動，却亦很可能的，視為歐戰要波及到遠東的先兆。但是揆之實際，日本雖然擁有强大的海上武力，却同時更有戰略上與經濟上的重大弱點；它倘若不能從中國拔出深陷的泥足，並從中國掠取資源補其虧耗，則即使歐局再度阢隍，予以發動南進的較好機會、亦復强弩之末，不足為患。羅斯福總統稱中國是美國的偉大國防，並表示中國即將自美國取得更多的援助‘，正是針對着日本這一弱點。在這一點上，中國未來反攻對於安定遠東所發揮的功效，即使不能比美艦隊東開的作用更大，亦當與之匹敵。</p>
<p>經過了將近十年的黑暗，賴中國自身的努力振拔與國際友人的助力，光明已是逐漸接近了。然而在達到坦途之前，必不免還要經過一段非常艱苦的過程；蓋預料侵略者必因不甘即此失敗與沒落，必將嘗試其最後的凶暴。雖歷史所安排下的命運，絕非不甘心的嘗試所能挽回，但是所以應付其最後的嘗試者，必須作始終不懈的努力。</p>

<p>衣食住行對於一九四一年「衣食住行」的新方針  張孟昭　　歲月易逝，韶華不再，一九四〇年去矣。回溯此一歲中的衣·食·住·行的壓迫，艱難困苦，無以復加，粗布之衣料，從每尺三四角而至六七角，　糲之食，從每天二三元而至五六元，（包括家庭中柴·米·油·鹽·醬·菜）鴿籠之居，從十八九元而至近三十元，代步往返車資，從每天一角許而至三四角。（事實上，我步行之日多，趁車之日少，）衣·食·住·行·四項中，以衣·食兩項，最為驚人，衣料漲起百分之一百外，白米漲起百分這二三百，（猶以一九四〇年歲首為基準，若以戰前計，高逾十倍！（以余家食口之衆，眞有蚊負千鈞之苦！然而囤積奸商，還不肯放鬆一步，其將食而不化，遺子孫以造孽錢而敗家蕩產乎？抑將來頭作楊全宇而身首異處乎？殊堪浩嘆！無產階級者受物價壓逼之苦，大衆心弦的忿激，又豈能自抑!老友黃影呆君，設一九四一年是「危險年」，從世界·國族·以至於社會·個人·大家在風良舀天中飄流，的確是驚險異常！我對於一九四一年「衣食住行」的新方針，是只有再緊縮，「衣」小添新，「食」淡自甘，「住」唯容膝，「行」恃健步，縮緊褲帶，勤求開源，從千辛萬苦中，渡過此黑暗時代，迎接那不遠的光明勝利！我想總有一天！苦盡甘來，歡度愉快的生活吧！房屋中的空氣  田靑　　空氣雖是一樣看不見的摸不到的東西，而對於我們却是有很密切的關係，如果一旦空氣鬧成來源缺乏的恐慌，那比了比米不知要嚴重到幾千萬倍，因爲沒有了空氣，我們便不能生存在道個世界了，不但我們人類，就是其他一切的動物植物都要踏上死亡的一途。而且空氣的淸潔與吾，也與我們有很大的關係，要是每天淸晨多呼吸些新鮮空氣，誰都覺得身心爽快得很，精神也爲之一振，於是對於身體的康健方面當然有不少的幫助。反之，把許多人關閉在一間不通風的屋子中，那不到一刻，每個人都覺得悶鬱不堪，這在設備不佳的戲院裹時有這樣的感覺。更在五月的黃梅天，或是在夏季雷雨前的氣候，似乎在發蒸，胸上好像壓着塊石頭般的不舒服。這稱種的結果，都是空氣失了正常作用而後致成的惡果，所以我們對於房屋中空氣的調節，也應有注意一下的必要。　　房屋中的室氣必須使它暢通無阻，那只需多開窗戶，不但流通空氣，就是光綫也可充足。空氣一流通，我們身體上所發出的溫度和濕氣，就因空氣的流通而移動，把含有濕氣的空氣趕去，於是使四周冷而且乾的新鮮空氣進來代換，那精神一定可以立刻恢復。　　空氣的溫度對於人體的舒適與吾也有關係，所以在房屋中頂好掛一隻溫度表使房屋中保持一定的溫度。對於人體最適宜的溫度是攝氏十八·八度，的合華氏六十七度左右，在那時無論做什麼事，所得的結果是一定不會錯的。不過調節空氣，不是一件容易做的事。　　空氣的濕度，就是空氣中所含水分的程度，像在黃梅天，那時空氣的濕度很大，於是使人體感覺到不適。在上海以及近海或河流的一帶地方，一年中空氣的濕度很大，反之，離海岸遠的內地，那濕度是一定很小的。而且在同一地方的兩間屋中，濕度也有不同，所以濕度的變化很大。在冬天，屋中總不免要裝一隻火爐來取暖，火爐一生，屋中的濕度散小，於是容易患喉痛，因此往往在火爐上煮一鍋水，把鍋蓋揭去了，使水蒸氣便開來，這就是使空氣不致十分乾燥。而最適於健康的濕度是在五十至六十左右，這是由特製的濕度表測看出來的。病後的食補  王一木　　去秋妻病了兩個多月，很為厲害，請了無數次的醫生，服了無數劑的國藥，好容易才把病魔打退了。據醫生說：經了道一塲大病，大傷元氣，非好好調理，再服幾劑調理藥不可。可是妻却一口拒絕，說兩個月來，喝飽了苦水，連胃口都喝倒了。無論如何，再也不願與藥石爲伍。我雖苦苦勸伊聽從醫生的話，伊却毅然決然的，給我一個不啾不睬。這樣挨過了半個月，我眼瞧着伊瘦骨支離，不能恢復原狀，老是暗暗着急。有一天訪問老友瘦鵑，見他案頭有兩首讚頌九福公司樂口福麥乳精的詩：「可可麥精和乳酪，個中風味自津津，瓊漿玉液神仙樂，口福而今享世人。」「藥店飛龍困病時，蘭房盡日掩罘罳，憐伊骨瘦香桃後，喜獲仙漿進一巵。」我讀了這兩首詩，才知道他的夫人，也害過病，據說害的是痢疾，足有一個多月，病後淸獲了許多，也因爲怕服苦藥，不肯好好調理。有人勸伊服用麥乳精，周夫人向來節儉得很，一聽了舶來品的價格，舌撟不下，因此也不肯吃。恰好那時有人送了兩罐樂口福來，才天天早早冲服一杯，覺得色香味都上上和舶來品一模一樣；，再吃幾片樂口福麥乳餅乾，作爲早點，周夫人愛它香甜可口，竟吃開了胃口，一日不可無此君，效騐來了；面龐漸漸豐腴，身體漸漸健旺，早上起來操作了半天，也不覺得疲勞，於是把樂口福當作了恩物，在親友間津津樂道，倒像做了樂口福的義務推銷員了。我聽了這一席話，很爲高興，運忙買了兩罐樂口福，歸貽細君，連服了兩個月，面龐也漸漸豐腴，身體也漸漸健旺；樂口福，樂口福，眞是食補中唯一的聖品啊！短大衣  郁光　　女甲：你看，我新做的短大衣。　　女乙：那我去年做的可又過時了。　　女甲：你看新式的好看不好看？　　女乙：好看是根本沒有好看，倒是老式的穿着神氣得多，你看，袖子那麼大，袋也沒有，鈕扣也沒有一顆。　　女甲：那末你不做了？　　女乙：我做也要做一件的。　　女甲：不好看！爲什麼做？　　女乙：沒有辦法呀！爲了要適合潮流。天廚食譜　（卅八）（六八）五香鬆肉  （馮心擬稿）　　預備…猪肉　陳酒　甜醬　醋　茴香　薑汁白糖　蔴油　味精　　擭法…把猪肉（採全精部份）洗凈後切成方塊，和水少許先煮，至半熟即行撈起，濾乾水汁，再和以適量之味精，陳活，甜醬，醋，茴香，薑汁，白糖，蔴油等拌和，復入鍋炒之，至炒乾時即可取起佐食，香氣文靜，而味極鮮美。（六九）生炒鷄片  沈蔚青擬稿　　預備…鷄肉　冬筍　冬菇　火腿　猪油　凈白蔓　粉味精　　　　擭法…先把冬菇之擭捆去，用開水泡較，泡冬菇之汁水，不必個視，智看有用處，再把蔓粉用淸水少許調味，鷄肉，火腿，冬筍分別切咸薄片，切好復併在一起，用猪油先炒十餘鍺刀，再把泡冬務之汁水個入，並和以適量之味精及鹽錢，復燒一二分個，然後再將調和之蔓紛澆入，用　刀兜底拌和，拌燒片刻，使有膩性，即可盛起，趁熱佐膳，味必鮮嫩絕可口也。　　諸君：如欲購買「味精」，「天廚瞥油精液」，及油，鹽，醬，醋，請撥電話「四四五九四」，當即飭尃差送辜，不取送力。一星期經濟菜單  華英女士　　大棵的白菜，每担維要五塊錢，但是到了冬季，大家就要用鹽滬醃一些，先放在大缸中，把石塊壓住，經過了一星期光景，便可拿起來盛在甏裹，隨時取食，通稱鹹白菜，早上可以用它來佐粥，那菜心甜津津地很覺爽口。午餐時也可利用它來做菜；葷的可以把來和小塊的猪肉或蹄膀一同白燉，或是切了絲，和猪肉或牛肉絲一同紅燒，別有風味。素的可以把它和豆腐一同紅燒，或切了絲和百葉絲一同淸炒，都是下飯的妙品。冬季菜蔬中，與新醃的雪菜，可稱爲難兄難弟。　　星期一　　鹹白菜燉肉　干貝蘿蔔絲　雪菜燒豆腐　紅燒搘心菜　　星期二　　洋葱牛肉絲　糖醋煎帶魚　青菜黃豆芽　蝦子炒麵筋　　星期三　　雞血豆腐湯　葱烤小鯽魚　紅燒素鋪蓋　京冬菜粉皮　　星期四　　膠菜炒肉絲　紅燒鳊魚片　百菜鹹白菜　素油豆腐湯　　星期五　　番薯牛肉湯　蘿蔔絲炒暇　雪菜絲豆芽　紅燒素十景　　星期六　　薺菜炒肉絲　魚頭燒豆腐　葱花豆瓣沙　糖醋辣白菜　　星期日　　雞雜湯　麵拖蟹　炒菠菜　蘿蔔片衣食住行之年高近態（上）  天視　　自第二歐戰發生，大陸人民日用之需，莫不適應環境而別呈新貌。爰就籍集Leipzig維出納僑府Koln古渡Utrecht諸名城秋季年市應時物產，擷舉要端分述之。　　一曰衣　大陸諸邦之競產人造絲與人造羊毛，以代絲與羊毛，志在避免舶來品之牽制。人造絲所成綢料，分染各種鮮艷色彩，或更加印花紋，利於製爲婦人用之雨衣雨傘。人造羊毛最近製作更精進，其出品之佳者耐水浸，旣便禦寒，而又不妨著雨。人造羊毛撚成之毛綫，異常堅靱，不僅可以用諸縫衣機，且可縫接救火車附裝之長水管，至若工廠內連接兩部機器間之長帶，現今參合人造絲以織成，堅强逾牛革，亦便藉人造羊毛綫，加以縫合。此顯人造絲與人造羊毛之兩物，於營業不相抵觸，於實用却相輔相成。　　同時德國籍集城之成爲世界裘業中心，乃爲加强德俄經濟合作之象徵Symbol，俄國夙擅毛皮之利，而德人闡究色染，精心獨造，舉世無儔，舊法染裘之色，惟黑與棕，大抵摹寫動物本有之毛色，先僅爲浮面之塗，繼則爲透入甚深之浸，再後知用化學品。其發明於十九世紀初葉者，爲自煤中提取滷砂元子組安息香液，德文名「Anilin靛族染料，」其後情益求精者，爲同屬於環形化學式之芳香屬有機體，因其亦取諸煤（煤即石炭，）德文遂名爲「靛炭染料Ind·anthren。」（Ind靛之省文，anthren石炭也，中國商界音譯之名稱爲陰丹士林。）用此新染料所染之裘，不僅可顯動物本有之毛色，且便染成種種不同之色。俾隨各人膚髮體態之宜而等自配選。德著作家「女性何者爲老」之雋言有云，「必待天冷而始衣裘者，其人爲老，Wenn　sie　ihren　Pelzmantel　nur　an　wirkllch　kalten　Tage　anzieht」此見西女愛悄coquette，遠過華人，時當夏季而裘不去身，不以爲異。　　二曰食戰時飲食貴乎「博」，誠以一國之物產，儘有絀於此而豐於彼者，若不能常得之物，盡知以他物爲代，自無向隅之憾。例如華茶不易達西歐，則有製果汁Ssft之工廠紛起製「提煉茶Tee-extrakt以出售，此項「提煉茶，其內無「茶精Tein，」昏暮飲之不至損淸眠，同時更取國產最豐富之胡桃樹葉，配以菩提樹花Linden-blute等物，成「代用茶，」而咖啡之贋鼎，乃爲焦糖所製之「人造咖啡，」購者若共磨碎之咖啡，拌合煮飲，便可於無形中，節省不易多得之咖啡粒。荷蘭十足Deka牌「慰情一管Tubertroost」之代用咖啡，根據西方社會慰情一盞之咖啡典故，寥寥二字，耐人尋思。而自健康之問題言，近年替代茶與咖啡之最佳飲料，莫便於德人所提倡之「蘋果茶Ahfel-Tee。」</p>

<p>春秋試筆記  裴苓　　據說：「元旦試筆，諸事亨吉。」　　去年上了一次當，也是因爲太相信它而「試」了一决「筆」，但結果大出意外，非但不「吉」，而且反「凶」起来；所以在今年的元旦，本想不理它，但又不願沉默，還是再「試」一次罷！不過，得要聲明，並不是希望「諸事亨吉」，因爲在這個年頭，生活的栗碌，社會的紊亂，本已無「吉」可言，又何况「吉」事偏和窮措大搗蛋，沒有則已，有便在朱門富貴家呢。　　閒話休題，要「試筆」必須材料，那裹能有現成的材料呢？說空話我可不願也不會，而且房東太太在房門外爲了三樓的房客多用了自來水而在毫無顧忌地謾駡着，簡單的腦袋給吵得神志不定，嘆口氣放下了筆，帶上圍巾，走出了大門。　　找材料去！　　「發財先生大老闆！做做好事啊！可憐呀三天沒吃飯，賞格一分買隻大餅吃吃，發財先生啊！……」　　剛走出弄堂便被攔着，哭哭啼啼地對着你，這在上等人們一定以爲不「吉」之事而要重重地吐口唾沫，但我是見慣了的，也就不以爲不「吉」；不但此也，出了弄口沒幾步，老遠就看見一大羣人擠在馬路中央，什麼事呢？沒有什麼，小事情，簡單得很：一部塌車裝着幾袋花生經過此地，被一羣「癟三」攔住，花生便一把一把地被塞在一些破血髒的衣袋裹　　巡邏來了，一陣亂棒趕走了「癟三」，但並沒走遠，仍舊散在馬路兩旁和附近，百多隻眼睛還貪戀地注視着抓破了的麻袋和落在地上的花生。車夫在車旁揩着汗。　　「狄班江北赤老頂弗是東西，隨便哈末事總要搶格，上趟阿拉看見伊拉搶煤球……」一個戴眼鏡的穿西裝的胖子搖搖頭。　　另一個沒有加入他們的談話，他在微笑地注視那班「癟三」，似乎爲這幕活　的「不幸」停止而惋惜。　　我要找「材料」，直向前走，「材料」沒我着，却又遇見了一件不「吉」的事：一個女孩子，穿着破大的舊棉襖，底下却是一件單神，赤着脚，蓬着頭，背上還用布裹着一個更小的孩子（也許是她的弟妹），一哭着喊着一直跟着我。　　　「先生！謝謝你！把我一分洋鈿，先生！謝謝你好吧」　　我給她一分錢，她三說了聲謝謝才向原路跑回去，背上的孩子被顫動而哭起來，但哭聲是多麼地微弱呀！　　「不吉之事何多！」教想着，仍默默地向前走，一直倒遇見一個朋友。　　「哈囉！恭喜恭喜！他老遠便舉起手。　　「恭喜恭喜！那兒去？」　　「大光明。」　　「再會！」　　忽怱地講了幾句話便分別了，他找尋他新年的快樂去了，我仍舊向前走去。　　乾燥的路上漸漸多了雨點，我抬起頭，天空冷冰冰地板起灰色的面孔。於是頽然地向原路回去，小女孩還在背着地的弟妹在跟住另一個人；搶花生的「癟三」大部退散了，只有幾個「小赤老」還需在地上搶花生；弄當口的乞丐還在哭哭啼啼地叫着，只雨點落得更大了。　　我走進了房門便抓起放下不久的筆。秋海棠  秦瘦鷗　　一　三個同科的弟兄　　　「打死你一子，有一子與你償命，也就罷了，你管他秋兒，你管他沉香！……啊！告訴你，老三！」正在獨自背着寳蓮燈詞兒的劉玉華，突然想起了一件事，回頭去看着坐在屋角裹的另一個學生說：「方才聽高玉良他們在談論，好像這一個新年裹，咱們打大年初一起，一直到正月半，每大都得在廣和樓出台咧！」老三是一個將到十九歲的孩子，身材很瘦，却並不高；在一件深灰色的棉布大褂的衣領上面，長着一張怪淸秀的臉龐。鼻子，耳朶，眉毛，嘴和眼睛，都搭配得非常整齊，正是很現存的一具美男子的模型。　　他把上身靠着牆壁，坐在一張很結實的板凳上，雙眉微蹙，臉朝着東，視錢漫無目的地射在紙窗外面的一棵槐樹上，神氣顯得很憂鬱，劉玉華跟他說的一串話，他像根本沒有聽到一樣，半響不曾回答。　　「怎麼？又想老娘啦！」　　不錯，吳玉琴從六年前進道個玉振班以來，晝夜所思量着的就祇他那四十多歲的老娘。師傳每决稱讚他，他自己並不覺得高興，因爲他想一個好好的男人，爲什麼要搽脂抹粉的去裝小娘兒？可是他禁不住不替他老娘歡喜，因爲他記得很淸楚，當他舅舅走着協盛銀號文掌櫃的路子，把他送進這玉振班來學戲的前一晚，老娘就整夜沒有睡，顚來倒去的向他說：「進去之後，千萬好好地學戲，聽師傳和先生的話！只要你的戲唱好，娘就有飯吃了！」他知道老子是在自己出生的那一年就死去的，除掉三間破平房之外，什麼也沒有留下，母子倆就靠着一塊大洋的房租和　每月貼補的三四塊錢過日子，平常，十天倒有九天是吃的燒餅，窩窩頭或是黑麵，十多年來，老娘委實沒有好好地吃過飯，所以師傳每次稱讚他一句，他好像就看見碗熱騰騰的雪白的大米飯，已端到他老娘面前去了，他就禁不住打心底裏歡喜起來。（一）修養要語（三）　　人應該有超職業的精神，就是除了努力於職業以外，還該提出一部分的精神與時間來，爲社會服務，絕不受絲毫酬報，旣不要名，也不要利，行我心之所安，至於做什麼服務，那當然　　要適合社會的需要，與自己的能力。輓徐季龍太表叔聯  王一之　　遺世有仙山，萬刧冰霜昭簡帛。　　知音惟國父，廿年陵谷感人琴。　　休戚總相關，使命四方才是累。　　栖皇此何世，雲情一往海俱深。生與死  亞光作</p>

<h3>The Beginning of the Year of Victory: Frequent Reports of Triumph from Suiyuan West and Henan North; Chinese Troops Recapture Important Strongholds Southeast of Wuyuan; Northwest of Qinyang, Forces Enter Tai and the School Commandant's Camp</h3>
<p>A certain area of Suiyuan: After days of courageous counter-attacks by Chinese troops against the Japanese troops occupying Xifangyingzi, across from Ma Qidu Ferry, southeast of Wuyuan, the area was completely recaptured in one day. The remaining Japanese troops fled east. After the defeated Japanese troops who invaded the vital Yellow River retreated, Chinese troops are currently still in pursuit. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Late on the 31st, Chinese troops launched a fierce attack on Tai, the School Commandant's Camp, and other locations northwest of Qinyang. Chinese troops fought valiantly in close combat, and by 1:00 AM on the 1st, they had captured the two strongholds of Bang Tai and the School Commandant's Camp. In this battle, over 400 Japanese soldiers were killed, 2 officers and 92 soldiers were captured, and over 200 machine guns and rifles, as well as a large amount of military supplies, were seized. (5th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Various towns in the Dongjiang area, as well as the counties of Huizhou, Boluo, Haiyan, Lufeng, and Bao'an, have recently been subjected to fierce bombing by Japanese aircraft, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries and significant losses, leaving them in a semi-desolate state. In addition to dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns, Japanese aircraft also dropped a large number of leaflets to threaten another advance on northern Guangdong. It is claimed that the bombing will continue. A mixed Japanese brigade near Shantou is reportedly active and plans to converge with another column advancing from Zengcheng to attack northern Guangdong, a strategy largely the same as that adopted on New Year's Day last year. There are currently about 12,000 Japanese troops southwest of Zengcheng, and 4,000 Japanese troops in Dongguan, who are reportedly being transferred to Zengcheng to participate in the northern attack. There are also reportedly 10,000 Japanese troops concentrated in Conghua and Huaxian. The high command of the Chinese troops in Shaoguan has not been able to determine whether the Japanese intend to attack northern Guangdong for a third time, only stating that they are prepared to deal with any eventuality. It is also possible that the Japanese, considering the Chinese troops transferred from Guilin to the Xijiang area and Wengyuan, are preparing to take a defensive posture. (5th International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: (1) Over a thousand Japanese troops invading Xing County were fiercely attacked by Chinese troops who had them surrounded.

<h3>Welcoming a New Epoch-Making Year</h3>
<p>— Sun Ke</p>
<p>President Sun's article analyzes the international relations between China, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan, and determines that the thirtieth year of the Republic of China will mark a new era in Chinese and Pacific history. This new era will be the final victory of China's war against Japan and the thorough resolution of the Pacific issue. Based on reason, the current situation, and history, it is concise, insightful, and thought-provoking. Due to delayed mailing, it is being published as a supplement.</p>
<p>Today is the auspicious day of the first day of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China, and it is also the time when the outcome of our war against Japan has been largely determined. According to our prediction, the thirtieth year of the Republic of China will mark a new era in Chinese and Pacific history. This new era will be the final victory of China's war against Japan and the thorough resolution of the Pacific issue.</p>
<p>Only after China's final victory in the war can the Pacific issue be reasonably resolved. This is inevitable due to reason, the current situation, and history, and we firmly believe it. The so-called Pacific issue is actually the problem caused by Japan's sole control over East Asia.</p>
<p>In the past, after the Meiji Restoration in Japan (1868), Japan imitated Europe and the United States, striving for wealth and power, while China declined due to the昏庸昏庸and corruption of the Qing court. Korea, Taiwan, and the Ryukyu Islands were successively annexed by Japan, and the Manchurian Qing was unable to resist. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Japan continued to fight and defeat Imperial Russia in 1905. At that time, the international balance of power in the Pacific was broken, and Japan's plot to subjugate us became even more urgent. During the First World War, Japan presented Yuan Shikai with the Twenty-One Demands, fully exposing its aggressive ambitions. The Washington Conference and the Nine-Power Treaty were intended to restrain Japan, and although their effect was seen for a time, Japan increasingly sought ways to exclusively occupy China. Two years later, the Tanaka Cabinet was formed, secretly playing the "Positive Policy for Manchuria and Mongolia," openly taking the conquest of China as the foundation for conquering the world. The following year, the "May 30th" Incident occurred, and two years later, the "September 18th" Incident saw Japan occupy the three northeastern provinces. Five years later, the "July 7th" Incident broke out, completely destroying the overall situation in the Pacific. From this perspective, none of the so-called Pacific issues in the past century have not centered on Japan's attempt to dominate. Therefore, to solve the Pacific issue, we must seek the root cause to be effective.</p>
<p>What is the root cause? China's rise to fight and seek final victory. Tracing back to "July 7th," in order to maintain national independence, the survival of the people, and to restore peace in the Pacific, our country, based on the great guidance of the Three Principles of the People and the inspiring leadership, launched a long-term national war on "August 13th." The Shanghai battle lasted for three months, and the arrogance of the Japanese army was thwarted. The capital fell, but we did not accept a treaty of surrender. The transfer to Wuhan put the Japanese army in a quagmire, unable to extricate themselves. After three years of stalemate, Japan spent a huge 6 billion yuan in war expenses and suffered 1.5 to 1.6 million casualties, yet the Japanese army's predicament has not been slightly alleviated. Countries around the world have changed their psychology of fearing Japan and shifted their gaze to the revival of the Chinese nation. As the European war ended in France's defeat, the Japanese army was eager to capitalize on the opportunity to advance southward, and their efforts became increasingly dispersed. With the Tripartite Pact, the United States and Britain joined forces to aid us, and the situation of restraining Japan was formed. Recently, Japan's attempts to woo the Soviet Union have failed, and with no way to seek peace, they are playing old tricks in confusion and desperation, signing "private agreements."</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, it is the opposite of Japan. Internally, military, political, and economic affairs have all made significant progress. The will of the people in both the front and rear to fight to the end has become increasingly firm as the war continues. Everyone takes defending the country and sacrificing one's own life to maintain the life of the nation as their duty. The national spirit, which has been latent for thousands of years, is becoming increasingly clear, and the common belief in the Three Principles of the People is becoming more and more steadfast. Externally, international sympathy and assistance have become increasingly active due to changes in the international situation. After the Tripartite Pact, the United States not only was not intimidated by Japan's empty threats, but its steps to aid us in restraining Japan have become more practical and active. The strengthening of military preparations, the enhancement of national defense, and the success of diplomacy are all aimed at restraining Japan by using Japan itself. The continuation of lending us 100 million US dollars is a direct indication of active assistance. Since the reopening of the Burma Road, Britain's Far East policy and actions have been completely consistent with those of the United States. As for the Soviet Union, it has always adhered to its consistent stance of aiding us, puncturing the Japanese poison plan of drawing us in. The other nations surrounding the Pacific are all looking forward to China's early victory. The current international situation in the Far East is more favorable to us than it has been in the past three years. If Japan advances further south, the United States and Britain will inevitably give it a substantial blow. This is the inevitable trend of events.</p>
<p>Such a timely opportunity is a once-in-a-thousand-year chance. We should switch from defensive to offensive warfare, and the day of final victory will surely come before our eyes, and the Pacific issue will be resolved easily. I hope that our compatriots will be mindful of the gravity of our responsibility, unite as one, and align our steps to welcome this new era of victory in warfare and national revival. I offer my sincere prayers!</p>
<h3>Wu Kaixian Speaks: "Welcoming the Year of Victory"</h3>
<p>Chongqing: At 6:30 this afternoon, the International Broadcasting Station invited Wu Kaixian, Deputy Minister of the Central Organization Department, to speak to the Shanghai community in his familiar local dialect, titled "Welcoming the Year of Victory." The full text is as follows: Elders and compatriots of Shanghai, today is the fourth day of the thirtieth year of the Republic of China. Although it has been three days since New Year's Day, I must still wish you a happy new year. Before the war, I had a close working relationship with you. After the war broke out, although I left Shanghai for a time, in the last year and a half, I have resumed my past relationship with you. Therefore, my New Year's greetings to you today are particularly heartfelt, because I have not only heard but also witnessed that since the National Army withdrew from Shanghai three and a half years ago, you in this so-called "isolated island" of Shanghai have stood up to fight in a harsh environment to support national policies, support the leader, preserve your personal integrity, and preserve the righteousness of the nation. You have not been cowed by power or lured by profit. Your spirit can truly move heaven and earth. Whenever I reported these touching and inspiring facts of your struggle to people in the rear, they all expressed great respect for you. Therefore, today I not only want to wish you a happy new year, but also represent the people in the rear to pay tribute to you. Because you live on an isolated island, your patriotic feelings are particularly strong, and your expectations for the final victory are even more eager. Now I can tell you some good news, that the thirtieth year of the Republic of China will be our year of victory in the war. This is not just our subjective hope, but an objective fact. Mr. Du Yuesheng has already told you a few days ago about the current military, financial, and international environment of China, and the central leaders spoke in particular detail in their New Year's Day report to our national compatriots. I think you all know these situations, and I don't want to waste your precious time repeating them. I would like to summarize by saying that since we started the war, whether in military, financial, or international environment, we have never been more favorable than we are now.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>1941 is a year of reckoning, a year of victory. This is the belief shared by the vast majority of humanity in the world. In the Far East, its form and significance are expressed even more profoundly and clearly. Tracing back to the September 18th Incident ten years ago, which shattered the security and balance of the Pacific, the overall situation in the Far East entered a state of dimness and darkness step by step; reason and justice, life and property, all suffered unprecedented disasters. China's solitary struggle was directly aimed at completing its own great cause of resisting aggression and building the nation, and indirectly aimed at restoring the original security and order; however, it was burdened by the overall international situation, which was reversing at the time, and failed to obtain sufficient encouragement and support from the world's powers to quickly achieve its full success. It was not until the autumn and winter of last year, when the global situation reached a turning point, that the world recognized the great significance of China's independent support of this precarious situation; and the aggressors who intended to take advantage of others' difficulties in order to achieve their greedy desires were also unable to escape the clear division of the international community. From then on, the Far Eastern crisis of nearly ten years reached a new turning point: China received the benefit of gaining abundant assistance, while Japan approached the point of self-destruction due to injustice. Therefore, everything such as the unprecedented strength of the United States' Far East policy and aid to China, the gradual convergence of British and American positions on the Far East, and even the frustration of Germany's attempt to attack Britain and the defeat of Italy's war against Britain and Greece, played a significant positive or negative role in the evolution of the Far Eastern situation. The shadow of the past decade has only recently revealed a new dawn. Whether in politics, military affairs, economics, or diplomacy, the excellent situation of those who oppose aggression is in stark contrast to the stretched resources of the aggressors, which is infinitely gratifying. From this, it can be seen that the so-called alternating rise and fall, the reversal of extremes, originally seemed to be a deduction within the realm of philosophy, but now, experiencing it in reality, it is also seen to be an unchanging truth.</p>
<p>The New Year's addresses of officials from various countries were all filled with optimistic self-confidence. For example, the communique of the Chinese leader exhorting the military and civilians to work hard to complete the great cause of nation-building was indeed inspiring. Even Nazi Germany, which was gradually entering a reverse, still made exaggerations of victory, which was still in keeping with the strong spirit of the Germanic people. Only Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's New Year's speech was hesitant and held a pessimistic tone. In comparison, although it cannot be immediately concluded as an empty and illusory confession, at the very least, it is a kind of sorrowful tone under distress and pressure. But on the other hand, whether his pessimistic view was still hoping for an improvement in US-Japan relations, or believed that US-Japan rapprochement had become hopeless, he still insisted on the old tune of his so-called "new order" and even "natural aspirations." In other words, the Japanese authorities, faced with various military and diplomatic failures, countless internal and external difficulties, and knowing that there was no possibility of success in the future, still lingered in the persistent dream of expansion and aggression. And the rumored spring offensive of the Axis powers, which has been circulating recently, is probably the last attempt the Japanese warlords are expecting. In fact, given the general trend, if any observer makes a clear forecast of future international trends, it is not difficult to recognize that the decline and disadvantage of the Axis powers cannot be reversed by a desperate gamble of reckless adventure. As for Japan and Germany and Italy, the former certainly hopes that the situation in the European war will favor Germany and Italy, so that the United States' attention will shift to the Atlantic; and the latter also hopes that Japan will launch something in the Pacific, in order to reduce American support for Britain. It is still difficult to predict how these mutually unverifiable wishes will be put together; however, the piracy that has recently been discovered in the Pacific is very likely to be regarded as a harbinger of the European war spreading to the Far East. However, in reality, although Japan possesses a strong naval force, it also has significant strategic and economic weaknesses. If it cannot extricate itself from the deep quagmire of China and plunder resources from China to make up for its losses, then even if the European situation becomes dangerous again, giving it a better opportunity to launch a southern advance, it will still be at the end of its rope and not enough to cause concern. President Roosevelt called China the great defense of the United States, and indicated that China would soon obtain more aid from the United States, which is precisely aimed at Japan's weakness. On this point, the effectiveness of China's future counter-offensive in stabilizing the Far East, even if it cannot be greater than the effect of the US fleet opening to the east, should be comparable to it.</p>
<p>After nearly ten years of darkness, thanks to China's own efforts to rise up and the help of international friends, the light is gradually approaching. However, before reaching smooth roads, we must still go through a very difficult process, as it is expected that the aggressors, unwilling to accept this defeat and decline, will try their last brutality. Although the fate arranged by history cannot be reversed by unwilling attempts, those who respond to their last attempt must make persistent efforts.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Reconvenes; Far East Issues to be Discussed; New Sino-American Stabilization Fund Agreement May Be Officially Signed Next Week</h3>
<p>Washington. As the U.S. Congress reconvenes, it is generally believed that the Far East situation will be an important topic of discussion. The Far East situation will include consideration of German ships' piracy in the Pacific, major U.S. takeover of British Pacific routes, strengthening the Philippine fleet and its defenses, and discussion of China's request to utilize four hundred aircraft. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington. Republican Representative Douksen of Illinois announced yesterday that he will submit two draft bills to Congress, proposing to convert every U.S. merchant sailor into a naval reservist to defeat the current Communist control of U.S. shipping. He stated that he will submit a proposal next week "to make it effective during times of national defense crisis." President Roosevelt's proposed $300,000,000 shipbuilding program is bound to raise a serious question: whether the expanded fleet should continue to be harassed by spies. (Reuters, 5th) At their secret meeting, Washington Democratic Senators unanimously elected Senator from Kentucky to continue as the Senate's Democratic leader, and Senator Hill from Alabama as deputy leader. The Republicans elected Senator from Oregon, the defeated U.S. Vice President McNary, as the Senate's Republican leader. In addition, Congressman Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, stated that the committee will conduct a major study on aircraft and ship manufacturing on Tuesday, and the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Towers, will be called to testify. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington. A spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury Department stated yesterday that the Sino-American Stabilization Fund agreement, with a total value of $50,000,000,000, may be signed next week. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington. Democratic members of the U.S. predicted yesterday that President Roosevelt may propose the establishment of a new government entity when he reports to Congress tomorrow to oversee the $3 billion aid program to Britain. Once established, this entity will cooperate with the U.S. Defense Committee and the Treasury Department to jointly manage British financial resources in the U.S. and the procurement of munitions.

<p>U.S. and Philippine Authorities Plan Actively to Defend the Philippines</p>
<p>Manila. Reliable sources recently stated that, along with the increase in U.S. naval and ground forces in the Philippines, U.S. and Philippine military authorities are jointly planning a defense program for the Philippines to achieve the greatest possible preparedness. It is said that U.S. and Philippine military leaders are considering the great strides of U.S. national defense activities to establish the defense plan for the Philippines. It is reported that U.S. Army officers are investigating the training organization and mobilization teams of the Philippine military to determine the necessary equipment for arming the Philippine militia. It is said that this investigation is to facilitate the estimation of the funds necessary for mobilizing Philippine manpower during times of emergency. Currently, the trained Philippine regular army and reserves total twelve divisions, which, together with the 10,000 U.S. Army regulars and Philippine Scouts stationed in the Philippines, constitute the first line of the Philippine Army. News from Washington states that the U.S. will allocate US$50 million from the gold evaluation proceeds and sugar tax to be used for the defense of the Philippines. This news is warmly welcomed by national defense personnel. U.S. Army authorities and the Philippine government are said to agree with this approach. If this amount is paid to the Philippines, it will be used to procure equipment for the Philippine Army. While this amount is insufficient for the entire Philippine national defense, it can immediately enhance the defense capabilities of the Philippine Army. Some well-informed sources have learned that even after this US$50 million is exhausted, the defense equipment for the Philippine Army will still be insufficient, and the U.S. federal government may allocate additional funds. The annual defense expenditure of the Philippines is US$8 million, but it is reported that the defense expenditure for 1940 was only US$3.5 million. This may be because Philippine officials believe that since there is no sufficient armament, there is no need to train more personnel, and therefore defense expenditures can be reduced. Since the birth of the Republic of the Philippines in 1935, after training a group of young Filipinos, there has been little increase in the necessary equipment for a modern army. As for the Philippine air defense, it has only recently been strengthened due to the dispatch of two complete squadrons of aircraft to the island by the U.S. Army. The U.S. Army here now has eighty aircraft, sufficient for the first line of defense. The Navy has at least twenty-six long-range patrol bombers. The current U.S. naval presence in Philippine waters is stronger than at any time since the U.S. occupation of the Philippines. The Asiatic Fleet currently includes the cruisers "Cincinnati," "Houston," and "Marblehead," three destroyer squadrons, one aircraft carrier, six S-class submarines, and eighteen large submarines, of which twelve have recently arrived. The Philippines currently has no navy, but the Philippine Army has a patrol squadron consisting of two fast motor torpedo boats, called "Q" boats. In addition, a surface patrol reserve team has also been established, incorporating merchant marine officers and sailors into the national defense organization. The establishment of the surface patrol team and its reserves is the first step towards a naval organization for the Philippines. Major General Valdes, Chief of Staff of the Philippine Army, has announced the appointment of more than two hundred merchant marine officers and personnel to various groups in the surface patrol reserve team. This reserve force is the core of a future naval reserve, sufficient to provide any maritime convenience that the government can requisition in times of emergency. This reserve team, like the Philippine Army Reserve, must be rapidly mobilized at any necessary time. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Senior Military Officer Appointed as Military Attaché to China; Expected to Arrive in Chongqing in Mid-Month; This Move by the British is of Significant Importance</h3>
<p>Chongqing. It was learned yesterday that the newly appointed British military attaché to China, Major General Dennis, is expected to arrive here on the 13th of this month. He will be accompanied by an assistant military attaché. This morning, the Central Daily News prominently carried this news, stating that it is the first time that the British government has appointed a senior military officer as military attaché to China, and this move is of great importance. A new building is currently under construction at the British Embassy's tennis court to serve as the officer's temporary office. In addition to Major General Dennis and the assistant attaché, the office staff includes Major Miller, Captain Baddoo, and Captain Perrier. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>Medical Clinics Established in Recovered Areas of Southern Guangxi</h3>
<p>Nanning. A reporter visited the person in charge of the Guangxi Provincial Health Department today to inquire about the sanitary facilities in the recovered areas of southern Guangxi. According to the discussion: (1) The provincial hospital has dispatched a medical and epidemic prevention team to be responsible for medical and epidemic prevention work, to guide the health offices of Yi, Long, Wuming, and other counties to resume work, and to request the assistance of the Central Health Department and the Red Swastika Society. All the cleaning of hospitals in the recovered areas has been completed. (2) It has been ordered that starting from the 30th year (of the Republic, i.e., 1941), all counties should promptly establish medical clinics in the townships. (3) The Nanning Provincial Hospital is being restored, and Zhang Zanyu has been appointed as the director. More than 100,000 yuan has been included in the provincial government's budget for the 30th year. (4th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Conscription Methods to Be Changed</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Cheng Zerun, Director of the Military Service Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs, stated that the conscription methods for this year will undergo several changes to adapt to the environment. For example, the originally scheduled monthly lottery for qualified conscripts will now be changed to once every three months. The government welcomes those who are not selected to volunteer. The previously established preferential treatment measures for the families of soldiers going to war will be strictly implemented. The required funds will be collected by those who do not contribute a conscript by paying one Sheng of grain per Mu or the equivalent in cash. Merchants will also pay according to this ratio. In addition, the funding for the National Army, which is outside the formal military service, has been secured, and all provinces will intensify training. Among them, Sichuan Province will have 4 million people, excluding those serving in the military, enrolled in the National Army for training. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities in Beiping Refuse U.S. Protest; Negotiations Fail to Yield Results</h3>
<p>Beiping. The Japanese authorities have refused the protest lodged by the U.S. against the detention and abuse of U.S. soldiers by the Japanese military police. Japanese military authorities claim that negotiations held earlier on the 5th have yielded no results. According to reports, the commander of the U.S. sailors stationed in Beiping requested an apology from the Japanese side and reported the matter to the Washington government because the Japanese side detained and beat four U.S. soldiers and forced three U.S. soldiers to sign letters of repentance. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>France Bombs Thai Ports</h3>
<p>Bangkok. The Thai Supreme Command announced that French planes bombed the Thai port of Macdanan on the Mekong River, Camerastin, and the Thai outpost of Charnumarn. Details of the bombing were not announced, but the communiqué stated that retaliation would be carried out. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Association Hosts Banquet for Burmese Journalists</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The China League of Nations Association, the Chinese National Diplomacy Association, and the Chinese branch of the International Anti-Aggression Movement held a joint banquet at the Guangdong Restaurant at about 9:00 p.m. on the 4th to welcome all members of the Burmese Journalists Delegation visiting China. More than 100 people attended, including Zhu Jiahua, Gu Zhenggang, Chen Mingshu, Lu Chao, Ma Chaojun, Zeng Xubai, Zhu Ziming, Zhang Daoxing, Bao Hua, and Wang Pengsheng. Zhu Jiahua, President of the League of Nations Association, presided over the event and delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the three organizations. (4th)</p>
<h3>Bomb Explodes on Huiai Middle Road, Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. Guangzhou news: A bomb was thrown in front of a store on Huiai Middle Road, killing several Japanese soldiers. The entire city of Guangzhou was in great turmoil at the time. (4th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Broadcasts to Japanese Nationals, Urges Them to Wage a War of Destruction</h3>
<p>To Thoroughly Implement the So-Called New Order in Asia; This Ideal Requires Fifty Years to Realize</p>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently broadcasted in Japanese to Japanese people around the world, saying that the ongoing destructive wars in the East and West are harbingers of future great construction work. According to translations received by foreign press circles, Matsuoka called on Japanese nationals overseas to cooperate with the government in order to achieve Japan's ideals. Matsuoka stated that Japan is engaged in the work of world peace and mutual prosperity, and predicted that Japan's ideals will be realized within fifty years. This broadcast, originating from Japanese radio stations, was broadcast to Japanese nationals in North and South America, Hawaii, China, and other countries. Matsuoka's remarks essentially reiterated his special New Year's Day speech, which has been criticized by Washington observers and members of Congress as being pessimistic and not intended to improve U.S.-Japan relations. While Matsuoka expressed hope that a new order of lasting peace could be built in the New Year, he also issued a warning that this year would be the most pessimistic and unfortunate year for all mankind. However, Matsuoka also believed that after the current war ends and a new order is established, there will be a bright future. The violent and destructive wars currently being waged in the East and West are the prelude to future great construction work. The world war of the past twenty years, the recent Second European War, and the Chinese War are all struggles ultimately aimed at an unprecedented global transformation. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>

<h3>Rumor of German Troops Entering the Mediterranean; Situation in the Balkans Tense; Turkish Troops Concentrated on Border; Bulgaria May Intervene in the Italo-Greek War</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia. Since receiving news yesterday that German troops will pass through Bulgaria to the Mediterranean, there has been great commotion here. Recent news, such as the arrival of several thousand German troops in Romania and the construction of fortifications in Romania facing Yugoslavia, coupled with Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov's recent trip to Vienna, has further convinced political figures that Germany is currently intending to do so. The German side here claims, "Germany will never allow Valona and Durazzo to become Italy's Dunkirk, and will therefore prevent Britain from gaining hegemony in the Mediterranean at any cost." Well-informed circles believe that if German troops do move towards Salonica, they can contain a portion of British ships in the Mediterranean, making it easier to attack Britain. Well-informed circles now also deeply believe that the Soviet Union will not act solely for the sake of the Balkans, but will act in its own interests. It is said that the movement of Soviet troops towards the Romanian border and the entry of German troops into Romania are merely coincidences. If such observations are correct, then Turkey is currently facing the danger of German troops obtaining Soviet consent to enter Salonica. The German terms of exchange with the Soviet Union are promises of territory and respect for Soviet interests in the Dardanelles. Therefore, the Soviet military preparations in the Black Sea are only to ensure that the Germans respect their promises. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome. The powerful Roman newspaper Il Popolo di Roma hinted yesterday that other German troops could join the battle in the Mediterranean region soon. The Turin newspaper La Stampa claimed that the U.S.'s expansion of armaments is completely useless and is only a moral suicide, because the U.S. has no borders with the Axis powers and does not need to defend its borders. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Budapest. The tense situation in the Balkans reached a new peak today, as news indicated that Bulgaria, incited by Germany, may soon intervene in the Italo-Greek war and aid the Axis powers. At the same time, Romania, which has been virtually completely taken over by the German "Model Army," suddenly stopped all telephone communications with foreign countries. Just as Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov was meeting with Nazi officials in Vienna, Bulgaria suddenly became the focus of attention. Diplomatic circles learned that Germany is putting pressure on King Boris of Bulgaria to allow German troops to pass through Bulgaria to Greece. At the same time, it is reported that Turkey is heavily concentrating reinforcements in the northwest region bordering Bulgaria and Thrace, apparently intending to take action. It is learned that Turkey has concentrated 800,000 troops, half of whom are assembled on the Thracian border. It is believed that the Soviet Union and Turkey are now putting counter-pressure on Romania to remain neutral. (International News Service, 5th)</p>
<p>Istanbul. It has been learned that a bill was proposed in the Turkish parliament last Friday stipulating that all young people currently undergoing the ordinary one-and-a-half-year military training should continue to receive another year of additional training. It is believed that Turkey can put on soldiers' uniforms another batch of men totaling approximately 2.5 million. Officials recently acknowledged that many men have been mobilized and that Turkey is currently in a state of "wartime preparedness." (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Ankara. According to news yesterday, Turkish army conscripts aged 21 and over will all remain in service for one year. This measure was decided by the Turkish government after a request from the General Staff, as it is considered necessary for national defense. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Capture Bardia, Taking Over 10,000 Italian Troops Prisoner; British Fleet Also Bombards Fiercely; Entire Bardia Plateau Destroyed</h3>
<p>Cairo. Since nightfall yesterday, the number of Italian troops in Bardia captured by the British has exceeded 15,000. Sir Archibald Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, has intensified his siege of Bardia. According to the British military communiqué issued today, Italian troops defending the entire northern section of the Bardia defensive line were forced to surrender yesterday evening. British patrol units have entered Bardia city in the southeast area of the outer defensive line. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Cairo. A communiqué from the British military headquarters in Egypt stated that British troops continued to advance towards Bardia and have now captured 8,000 enemies. The battle is proceeding smoothly. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Cairo. Today's war report stated that this morning, the British Blitzkrieg corps, the Australian assault team, broke through the inner defensive line of Bardia. After capturing 8,000 Italian troops and occupying half of the fortresses around Bardia, the assault team launched continuous fierce attacks on the Italian inner defensive line, resulting in this battle achievement. It is estimated that the Italian garrison's deaths and captures have reached 40%. It is said that the Italian military resistance is rapidly weakening. According to unofficial news today, British naval and air forces fiercely attacked the Italian military last night, leaving them no chance to retreat. It is certain that Australian and New Zealand troops did enter Bardia. A headquarters communiqué stated, "Our forces are making smooth progress around Bardia. British naval eyewitnesses say that our forces bombarded fiercely yesterday, and the entire Bardia plateau has almost been completely destroyed." (International News Service, 5th)</p>
<p>Cairo. It is reported that yesterday British Royal troops, led by Australian troops, launched fierce attacks on the main defensive line of Bardia from all sides. Although the Italian defenders resisted fiercely, it gradually weakened. Therefore, the fall of Bardia is expected to be imminent. It is said that the Italian defenders' casualties and captures have been between one-quarter and one-third of the total number of soldiers. (International News Service, 5th)</p>
<p>Alexandria. On Friday, the British Mediterranean Fleet, together with the army, launched an extremely fierce bombardment of Bardia. Reporters on the battleship witnessed the fleet firing at least 300 tons of shells at coastal artillery positions, lasting for ninety minutes. The main task was to bombard the mechanized troops concentrated northwest of Bardia in order to prevent their counterattack or retreat. When the British fleet arrived off the coast of Bardia, the army had already opened fire for an hour. Soon after, reporters saw a continuous barrage of artillery fire, densely packed like a string of beads. The British ships, about 10,000 yards from the shore, fired their cannons in unison in calm winds, calm seas, and clear visibility. Dust and sand rose up, obscuring vision. The Italian artillery retaliated, but their aim was inaccurate, and then they fell silent. The British ships continued to bombard until dusk before stopping. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<h3>British Bomber Squadrons Fiercely Attack the Port of Bremen; Dropping Tens of Thousands of Incendiary Bombs; German Planes Attack Britain Again the Night Before</h3>
<p>London. In the week ending at dawn on January 3, British bomber squadrons attacked Bremen twice and the Lorient submarine base four times, as well as other port targets at least sixteen times. The targets attacked in Bremen included the naval base, the Atlas shipyard, the Deutsche Vacuum Oil refinery, railway lines, warehouses, rice mills, and the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory. Bremen is Germany's second largest port and a very important industrial area in Germany. It suffered a third night raid on Friday night, with flames lighting up the sky, as fierce as the first night raid. The first night raid lasted three and a half hours, dropping 20,000 incendiary bombs. It is believed that after this fierce attack on Bremen, war equipment production will be greatly reduced for a time. According to reports from aircrew who attacked on Friday night, there were 21 major fires within one mile of Bremen, with thick smoke rising up to 9,000 feet. Fires broke out throughout the city, uncountable. From above, Bremen looked very much like a Christmas fire tree. The battle on Friday night lasted three hours. The British planes had poor weather at the start of the flight, but the weather improved after reaching the Dutch coast. Later, factories and docks were hit one after another, and black smoke filled and obscured the entire city, so it was slightly difficult for British planes to identify targets. The bombs and incendiary bombs dropped by British planes were very destructive, and the debris of buildings flew high into the sky, which the aircrew were able to witness. One of the largest factories in the city was completely on fire, and the fire spread along the railway line to the river. At that time, the fire and smoke enveloped the city, and the aircrew could only see the entire city in flames and could not observe the details of the destruction. During this week, British planes flew to Emmerich and destroyed a bridge with bombs dropped from a height of 500 feet. They also flew to Egersund in Norway, destroying a German 4,000-ton supply ship and warehouses and wharves. They also flew to Vlissingen in Belgium, destroying a ship equipped with anti-aircraft guns. The Lorient submarine base was attacked four times last week, and the north dry dock, power plant, radio station, and warehouses were all hit by British planes. British planes lost seven planes in attacking targets in various parts of Germany. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3>Rumor That Germany Has Requested of Vichy to Manage the Railways Through Italy; This Move Exceeds the Scope of the Armistice Treaty; The Attitude of the French Government Remains Ambiguous and Unclear</h3>
<p>London. The rumor that the German side has requested the Vichy government to allow them to manage the Mont Cenis railway leading to Italy has aroused much concern in London. A Reuters diplomatic reporter heard from a certain important French figure that this rumor seems more credible. This railway has existed for 70 years and passes through a tunnel under the mountain for seven and a half miles, making it the most direct and fastest route between France and Italy. The railway's capacity to transport troops and ammunition is also quite significant, and it is often not hindered by winter rain and snow. If the Axis powers were to seize this railway, they would benefit greatly, because the only main railway between Germany and Italy through the Brenner Pass has been overburdened in the past few months. Italy lacks coal and raw materials, so Germany has to send trains to transport goods to Italy every day. However, vehicles entering Italy must return, making the long round trip time-consuming. Moreover, the slopes on both the Italian and Austrian sides of the Brenner Pass are very steep, and the trains move very slowly between them. If Germany is determined to actively aid Italy, it must have a second railway, and the most suitable one would be the Mont Cenis railway. This matter obviously exceeds the scope of the armistice agreement. It is not yet known whether the Vichy government is prepared to make this concession. The needs of the Axis powers will be an opportunity to test Vichy. However, Marshal Pétain, who has colonies and a fleet, and who is the focus of the French people's prestige, will be able to resist German pressure with great force. The situation in Vichy is still chaotic. The cabinet's position remains uncertain, except for the resignation of Baudouin, who was inclined towards the Fascists. According to recent news, the situation in Vichy does not disappoint Britain. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Vichy. The French cabinet held a meeting yesterday under the leadership of Admiral Darlan, which lasted for two and a half hours. Darlan stated that Franco-German relations have "slightly improved," but that there is no dangerous or tense situation. He also stated that negotiations between the two countries, which were suspended three weeks ago after the dismissal of Laval, can now resume. At the same time, according to the order of the government list delivered by the French government to the U.S. Embassy, French Prime Minister Pétain has further adjusted the political power. The list is ordered with Darlan as the first cabinet member, followed by Army Chief of Staff Huntziger and then Foreign Minister Flandin, followed by Justice Minister Alibert. Previously, Baudouin was the first cabinet member. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<h3>Business Circle Supports Legal Tender, Refuses to Accept Miscellaneous Currency</h3>
<p>The "Reserve Bank" established by the Jiangning side is rumored to open today at 1 Zhongshan East Road and begin issuing "convertible notes". The issuance rights of "Huaxing" Commercial Bank will also be revoked from the same day. The Shanghai business community is paying close attention to whether the Jianghai Customs will accept the "Ning notes" afterward. However, the Jianghai Customs tax revenue has already been forcibly deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank. If "Ning notes" are collected afterward, it can actually reduce the opportunity for the Japanese to use legal tender to purchase foreign exchange, which will not only not harm the monetary policy of the National Government, but may also benefit it. As for various industries refusing to accept miscellaneous currencies, they still adhere to their original intentions.</p>
<p>Loyalty Army Controls Nanjing Suburbs, Safely Withdraws After Completing Mission</p>
<p>According to people from Nanjing, a large detachment of the Chinese Loyalty National Salvation Army recently arrived in the suburbs of Nanjing, with considerable strength. They frequently attacked various agencies and transportation inside and outside the city. On December 8th of last year, they once stormed into Jiangpu County, catching the Japanese army and miscellaneous troops off guard, who hastily fled. All the self-proclaimed agencies were occupied, and they fought back and forth in the city. In addition to killing thirty to forty Japanese and miscellaneous soldiers, they also captured more than ten hired police officers. It is said that the army safely withdrew after completing its mission. It is reported that in this battle, a certain captain of the army led several soldiers to sneak into Jiangpu County in advance, posing as detectives to make contact. On December 7th, they launched an attack, and the army units scattered outside the city responded in unison, bravely rushing into the city, resulting in this victory.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Values Elections, Council Elections Have Now Begun, Municipal Council Decides to Appoint Key Personnel to Handle</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council elections are only a little over three months away. Due to the Japanese side's continued attempts to increase the number of Japanese directors, this year's council elections will inevitably be more intense than last year. According to reliable sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rates Office has already begun to handle matters related to the election of council directors. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities have decided that due to the intense competition in this election and the heavy workload, in addition to the entire Rates Office handling the election matters, they will also appoint senior Western officials from among the chief executives to assist in the handling, in order to show prudence.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Personal Instruction, Thoroughly Investigate Price Gouging, Concession Authorities Send Personnel to Investigate Rice Reserves, Rice Brokers Should Continue to be Prohibited from Entering the Market</p>
<p>Since the military uprising, transportation in various places has been disrupted, and the transportation of essential goods has been difficult. Moreover, various places have successively become war zones, and the environment is special. General merchants take advantage of the opportunity to hoard goods and manipulate the market, doing everything possible. This is especially true for rice, which has led to the stimulation of various commodity prices, and the high cost of living is unprecedented. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from relevant sources in this city that the supreme leader Chiang Kai-shek, in order to thoroughly investigate food prices, crack down on hoarding, and protect the profits of legitimate businesses, has issued a personal instruction, ordering local administrative agencies to start suppressing rice prices and smoothing the source of rice. If anyone dares to disobey and deliberately hoard goods, the local authorities shall arrest them, conduct a trial, and handle the matter according to law. The relevant authorities in this city have received this notice and will inform the various rice industry groups to report the hoarding of rice truthfully, and will reward informants in order to stabilize the food supply in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Start Thoroughly Investigating Rice Reserves</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions are paying close attention to the increase or decrease of food allowances. In order to clarify the amount of rice reserves and use it as a reference for assisting the rice industry in price evaluation, they have dispatched special personnel to various rice warehouses to strictly investigate the quantity of rice, the date of storage, the place of origin, the price, and the name of the owner of the rice. If it is found that the rice has been stored for a long time without the intention of selling it, it is said that they will be ordered to reduce the price and release it from the warehouse, otherwise it will be confiscated and used for price stabilization.</p>
<p>National Rice Should Also Have Price Limits</p>
<p>Since rice trading returned to normal on the 3rd of this month, speculators have taken the opportunity to stir up trouble again. In the past few days, there have been unfounded rumors in the market, and they have flourished again, causing people to be uneasy and the market to be chaotic. Rice prices have been continuously pushed up, and national rice has even risen by two yuan, while foreign rice has also risen by more than fifty cents. The rice brokers are so rampant and unscrupulous, and severe punishment is absolutely necessary. Although the price of foreign rice has been re-evaluated and limited, the price of national rice should also be evaluated and limited to avoid the price of foreign rice from rising in response. Otherwise, the trading of national rice in the market should be prohibited. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Brokers Endanger the People's Food Supply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee was previously instructed by the concession authorities that the high price of rice and the chaotic market situation were greatly related to the illegal transactions of rice brokers. However, in order to prevent underground trading and illegal transactions, and to stabilize the entire food supply, it was decided to prohibit these rice brokers from entering the market for two weeks. After the meeting decided, it was announced and implemented on the 26th of last month. The two weeks have now passed on the 8th of this month, so rice brokers can return to the market from the 9th. However, the rice brokers are causing trouble in the market and endangering the people's food supply. These people have repeatedly engaged in illegal transactions in order to enrich their own pockets. It is hoped that the authorities will continue to prohibit these people from entering the market during this time of food panic.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment for Group Purchase Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain Cooperative Association has recruited more than 200 members. In order to reduce the burden of living, all members who purchase foreign rice will be given special preferential treatment. In addition to sending special personnel to deliver the purchased rice when it arrives at the port to avoid accidental losses, it has also been decided to reduce the amount of money collected in half before the rice arrives at the port. That is, for one to five bags, a deposit of 20 yuan per bag will be pre-collected. For six to twenty bags, a deposit of 30 yuan per bag will be collected. For more than twenty bags, a deposit of 45 yuan per bag will be pre-collected, in order to show preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Several American Missionaries Depart from Shanghai this Morning on the President Pierce</p>
<p>The American Postal Ship President Pierce of the American Postal Ship Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM via Manila and Hong Kong and docked at buoys 12 and 13. It carried 264 passengers, of whom 74 disembarked here, while the rest went to the United States or various ports along the way on the original ship. The ship brought 1,000 tons of cargo and 43 bags of mail. It left the port at 5:30 this morning, carrying some American missionaries and teachers from this port, taking the route through Japan and Honolulu to return to San Francisco and Los Angeles. The next ship to the United States is the President Taft, which is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Manila on the 19th of this month and leave the next day.</p>
<p>Pastor and Mrs. Meyer Died in Bombing, Eight Bombs Fell on Their Residence, Japanese Planes Must Have Been Deliberately Bombing</p>
<p>According to the Datong News, this office recently received a letter from Pastor Alton of the Hong Kong Chinese Christian Association, stating the circumstances of the bombing of Pastor and Mrs. Meyer Holt of the South China Gospel Church in Guizhou (transliteration) by Japanese planes. A section of the letter is as follows: "On December 22, when Japanese planes bombed Guizhou, Pastor Meyer's residence was hit by bombs, and the couple were killed. According to a letter from Mr. Lee of the Chinese Christian Association on his way to Xiuzhou (transliteration), the situation of Pastor Meyer's residence being bombed was described, saying that the Japanese planes must have deliberately carried out indiscriminate bombing. Eight bombs fell on Pastor Meyer's residence, and one bomb hit the room where the couple were sheltering, causing both of them to die. At that time, there were no people from the Gospel Church nearby, so Hong Kong has sent Mr. Stanner to bury the benevolent Pastor and Mrs. Meyer, and to take care of the funeral arrangements and collect valuable relics and documents. Pastor Meyer was the acting chairman of the South China Gospel Church. Together with his wife, they always assisted travelers through the most difficult section of the Sha Yu Chung to Xiuzhou line. Travelers found it convenient. Now that the bad news has come, those who have benefited from them are all shocked and grieved."</p>
<p>Public Concession Tramways Will Not Increase Fares for the Time Being</p>
<p>After the British-owned tramway company submitted an application to the Shanghai Municipal Council in December of last year for approval to increase the fares of trams on various routes, it was originally scheduled to be implemented from January 1st of this year. According to reports from the Pingming News Agency to the company, it is said that although the increase in fares has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the company authorities have not yet formulated a plan for increasing fares and need to consider it further before deciding on the implementation date. However, according to the opinions of the general public, public utilities should not be allowed to increase prices without restriction. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will give it careful consideration.</p>
<p>Three Bombs Found at the Intersection of Wangping Street and Hankou Road</p>
<p>At around 6:15 last night, someone suddenly placed a hand grenade wrapped in newspaper at the intersection of Wangping Street and Hankou Road. The upper end had a wooden handle exposed, and the lower end was tied with a copper ring. Fortunately, it was discovered by the concierge of this newspaper, who immediately summoned his companions to come and investigate the surroundings. Then, two more hand grenades of the same type were discovered under the steps of the Dachangyuan Paper Shop across the street and under the telegraph pole at the corner of the Foreign Cemetery. Fortunately, none of them exploded, so there was no damage. The concierge immediately reported the information to the Central Police Station, and several Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched in police cars to investigate. Then, the three hand grenades were taken back to the police station for investigation. Afterward, many police officers were deployed at the intersection of Wangping Street and Hankou Road to strictly defend and search, but nothing was found.</p>

<p>Commercial Workers Compete for Allowances, Knitting Industry Strike to be Negotiated Today</p>
<p>After all the workers of the Henan Road Commercial Press submitted requests to the management for improved treatment and increased allowances on New Year's Eve last year, a week has passed and a satisfactory solution has not yet been reached. The Shanghai Tongren Association received a telegram from a Hong Kong representative yesterday, reporting that General Manager Wang replied that the conditions proposed were too different from the management's intentions. The staff has scheduled an emergency meeting for this morning to discuss countermeasures and express their determination. The management is also trying its best to find a solution.</p>
<p>More than 300 engineers from more than 100 electrical machinery knitting factories have submitted requests to the factory owners for increased living allowances and improved treatment through the Federation. All conditions have been completely revised and approved, but the factory owners have not signed, which has caused dissatisfaction among all the engineers. The factory owners have agreed to invite the political department of the Concession authorities to negotiate today.</p>
<p>Holiday Dispute Resolved in Two Printing Houses</p>

<p>Dada South Leaves for Manila</p>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, the Shanghai branch of the French Postal Ship Company has denied the rumors published in Chinese and foreign newspapers about Luo on the Dada South. It is said that the ship left Shanghai on the 2nd of this month according to the scheduled itinerary and sailed to Manila and Saigon. This ship carries 100,000 bags of rice to Shanghai each time it travels between Saigon and Shanghai, which is especially needed by the Chinese people in this city.</p>
<p>Do Not Use Agency Envelopes for Letters Sent Abroad</p>
<p>Postal Headquarters Instructions for returning those who do not comply with regulations: Letters sent abroad must be forwarded through Vietnam. Recently, due to the special circumstances in that area, in order to avoid illegal inspection and detention, the place of dispatch cannot use the name of the agency, army serial number, or special representative mailbox. If the nature of the letter is important, it should follow government regulations and change to airmail directly to Hong Kong or Yangon for forwarding, and indicate this forwarding route on the envelope to show caution. All letters that do not comply with the regulations will be returned by the Kunming Administration for a new envelope to be sent again.</p>
<p>Part of the Bridges on the Suzhou Creek Were Blocked Again Yesterday</p>
<p>At 9:00 yesterday morning, the Waibaidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, and Sichuan Road Bridge on the Suzhou Creek were blocked again by the Japanese, cutting off traffic. The original state was restored at around 10:00. The reason is said to be that the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Admiral Nomura, returned to the country to go to the United States.</p>
<p>How China Can Wage a Protracted War (3) by Hu Shih</p>
<p>These and other similar questions, I believe, you have often heard people ask in recent years, especially in the last thirteen months since the outbreak of the European War. Here I will use the remaining time to explain why China cannot and is unwilling to give up fighting.</p>
<p>First, China cannot give up fighting now because giving up fighting is tantamount to complete surrender, sacrificing the independence and freedom for which we have fought for forty months. The best lesson for China is the surrender of France. China does not want to suffer the same fate as France is now.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I gave a speech in New York, at which time I quoted the words of an American friend: "China is now in Valley Forge; but I hope she will soon be in Yorktown." You know this, your own history, and from your history, I would like to cite a few words to remind you of the terrible suffering that George Washington's army encountered in Valley Forge in the winter of 1777. "When the poor soldiers marched toward their winter quarters on December 17, 1777, they left a bloody trail behind them...On December 23, Washington reported to Congress that 2,898 men in his camp were unfit for duty because they were barefoot. Cold and hunger increased the number of sick; in the hospital, people often died for lack of straw to lie on." That was the situation in Valley Forge in the winter of 1777. But the founding fathers who created the American Republic did not give up the war. They continued to fight, and four years later, they finally achieved the final victory in Yorktown. By comparison, we have indeed moved away from the difficult period of Valley Forge, so we must not give up halfway until we have achieved national independence and freedom.</p>
<p>Second, we understand very well that the aggressors are not willing to give up because they are insatiable. You certainly have not forgotten the peace of Munich in 1938. When the four great peace creators returned to their country from Munich, they were warmly welcomed by the people because they had avoided a war and kept Europe at peace. At that time, Chamberlain said to the world, "I believe this is the peace of our generation." But, friends, where is the peace that the four great government leaders of Europe signed and guaranteed?</p>
<p>It is impossible to achieve true peace in the Far East at present. Because today's peace in the Far East will be the second Munich, perhaps worse than Munich. No politician in the world today dares to initiate such a Far Eastern Munich; and the government and people of China will never accept it.</p>
<p>Third, the surrender or collapse of China today is equivalent to a major disaster for the world's democratic countries in resisting the aggression of authoritarian countries. You have seen the news that the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin a month ago, which clearly tells you that Japan, Germany, and Italy have become military allies. The three years of China's war have weakened Japan's national power, making it unable to actively assist its European partners in aggression. As American military expert Elliot said, "When we think of Britain fighting for freedom, we must not forget that China is also fighting for freedom, and China has been fighting heroically for more than three years. The invading armies that China is resisting and the invading armies that Britain is resisting have colluded with each other, and we are preparing to resist these invading armies." Therefore, if we surrender now, we will not only allow the aggressive forces in the East to do whatever they want, but also deal a great blow to the democratic powers that are now focusing on the struggle for life and death.</p>
<p>For these reasons, China is still fighting intermittently. (End)</p>
<p>De Gaulle Headquarters Established in Shanghai, French Nationals in the Far East Have Responded Enthusiastically</p>
<p>According to sources, the Free French De Gaulle Headquarters has been established in Shanghai to be responsible for propaganda work and to raise money for French nationals to volunteer to go to London and various places under the command of General De Gaulle. In November of last year, a total of 23 people from the Far East went to London or Africa to join the Free French Army. The number increased significantly in December. On New Year's Day this year, 26 sailors from the French freighter Dada South went to Hong Kong to join the Free French Army. It is expected that more French nationals in the Far East, including Vietnam, will rise up and respond to General De Gaulle's call, drawing their swords and fighting for freedom. In addition to Shanghai, De Gaulle Headquarters have also been established in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>

<p>New Highs in the Red Market, Domestic Debt Credit is Stronger than Ever, Principal and Interest Due Have Been Deposited in Special Accounts, Funds Should Be Allocated According to Pro Rata Shares from Various Free Customs</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has always fulfilled its debt repayment obligations on schedule, especially the customs-guaranteed debt reparations, which have never been overdue. It has repeatedly advanced large sums of money for timely repayment, which has long been admired by Chinese and foreigners. Since customs revenues from war zones have been seized, it has been unavoidable to announce future customs debt repayment methods. The amount to be allocated from customs revenues outside war zones according to pro rata shares will be transferred to a special account at the Central Bank. The domestic debt fund to be allocated from various customs outside war zones in 1940 is 8,582,071.39 yuan, which has been transferred by the Chief Inspector of Customs, Mr. Merrell, to the Central Bank for storage, to be used for the payment of principal and interest on the Unified Reconstruction Golden Long Three Debt. The National Debt Fund Management Committee, in view of the fact that the amount to be allocated from customs outside war zones is insufficient to repay the three customs-guaranteed debts, has agreed with the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong to pay the matured interest and drawn principal of the Unified Reconstruction Golden Long Three Debt by discounting it through the four banks, which has been approved by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, bondholders have expressed their support for the government's measures. The prices on the unofficial securities market have soared, and the New Year's red market has reached a new post-war high.</p>
<p>Unified Public Debt</p>
<p>The principal of the 1936 Unified Repayment of Principal has been drawn, and payment will begin on January 31. Shanghai will be paid by the Central Bank and its entrusted China and Communications Banks. According to the discount method, the bondholder must fill out a discount voucher application form. After verification, it will be paid in six installments, one installment per month, until the end of June 1941. The principal to be paid this time is 15,430,000 yuan, and the interest is 41,061,300 yuan, for a total of 56,491,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Reconstruction Public Debt</p>
<p>The total amount of the 1936 Reconstruction Public Debt is 340 million yuan. The tenth drawing of principal will be held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee at 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month. The principal and matured interest of each drawn ticket will be paid from February 28. The payment method is the same as for the Unified. The principal to be paid this time is 2,720,000 yuan, and the interest is 9,600,8400 yuan, for a total of 12,328,400 yuan. The paying agencies are the Central Bank and its entrusted China and Communications Banks.</p>
<p>Golden Long Public Debt</p>
<p>The total amount of the 1928 Financial Long-Term Public Debt is 45 million yuan. The seventeenth drawing of principal will be held by the National Debt Fund Management Committee on March 10. The drawn bonds and matured interest will be paid from March 31. The principal repaid is 1,125,000 yuan, and the interest paid is 337,500 yuan, for a total of 1,462,500 yuan. The outstanding debt amount is 25,875,000 yuan. The payment method this time is the same as for the Unified Reconstruction.</p>
<p>Coal Stolen from US Military Camp</p>
<p>Mi Wengan and Zhu Ada, local residents working as odd job workers in the US military camp, colluded with cleaners Luo Yongren, Cao Zijing, Chen Asan, and Gu Hengrong on and before the 3rd of this month to steal white coal from the military camp. Yesterday, they were discovered by the soldiers on duty in the army, who first detained the defendants and then reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Chinese detectives Zhu Chiqing and Xia Yishan brought Zhu et al. back to the police station for investigation. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court and prosecuted for theft. Judge Liu presided over the court session. The defendant Zhu Wengan confessed that the idea of stealing coal came from the cleaner Luo Yongren, who said that he was responsible for hiding the coal in the garbage truck, covering it with garbage, and selling it without leaking the secret. Unfortunately, it was discovered only on the fourth theft. He was willing to hand over the dozens of yuan of stolen money in full and asked the court not to convict him, etc. After verifying the facts, the court questioned the other defendants, whose confessions were mutually evasive. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody pending judgment.</p>
<p>Bank Employee Found Guilty in Embezzlement Case</p>
<p>Employee of the Transportation Bank Sentenced to Five Years, Embezzled US$13,000, Sentenced by the British Supreme Court</p>
<p>British Supreme Court Judge Jones sentenced Mark Zeller to five years in prison yesterday. Mark Zeller, an employee of American Express Bank, was charged with embezzlement and successively embezzled US$6,000 and another US$7,000. Mark, a graduate of Xavier School, is famous in the sports world in this city. After the presiding judge finalized the verdict, the judge read the judgment, saying that Mark's embezzlement at American Express Bank may have had its reasons, but it was ultimately inexcusable, and the defendant had accused his superiors and colleagues, but could not provide evidence.</p>
<p>Shen Zhongfang Kidnapping Case, Gangsters Scheduled for Continued Trial</p>
<p>Shen Zhongfang, 63 years old, director of the National Medicine Pediatrics Clinic and Shanghai Branch of the Central National Medicine Museum at 646 Jing'an Temple Road, was kidnapped by bandits who broke into the clinic on August 30 of last year. He was trapped in the bandit den for 83 days. Later, the police learned that the hostage was hidden in a cattle shed in Minhang South Township, and the garrison team went to the address in secret and rescued Shen. The details have been published in the newspapers. Subsequently, the police, based on reports, arrested nine bandits, including Zhang Zhenbiao and Ding Laosan, at 510 Central Broadcasting Station and 4, Lane 726, Fuzhou Road, and sent them to the First Special Court for prosecution for kidnapping. A special court was opened by Judge Feng the other day for strict interrogation, and the result was an order to change the date. It is now learned that the case has been scheduled for continued trial on the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>Fire at Dalian Bay Road</p>
<p>A three-story Western-style house at 7 Dalian Bay Road, Yangshupu, caught fire yesterday morning at around 5:25 AM. Thick smoke and flames shot up into the sky. The Yangshupu Fire Department dispatched pump trucks to put out the fire, which was extinguished after about an hour and a half. As a result, the entire house was reduced to ashes. Fortunately, it was daytime, and no one was injured.</p>
<p>US Decides to Supply War Equipment to Aid and Maintain Free Nations, Believes Axis Nations Cannot Win, Woodhead Supplements Roosevelt's Remarks</p>
<p>According to the English-language Greater America Evening News yesterday, Woodhead's comments stated that President Roosevelt's "fireside chat" broadcast in the United States on December 29 of last year can be called the most important speech made by a head of state in the past ten years. President Roosevelt's original speech was very long, lasting for 40 minutes when broadcast, but what was published in various newspapers in this port at that time was only a glimpse. Here are some supplementary remarks on the more important ones. Among them, regarding the United States' guarantee to aid Britain and other countries that maintain world freedom with aircraft, tanks, artillery, freighters, and other war equipment, so that these countries can fight for their own freedom and the safety of the United States, President Roosevelt said, "The United States' expansion of armaments and the transportation of weapons and supplies that we can save to help the defenders fighting on the front line is of great help to the democratic countries' resistance to aggressors and must be of greater help. This action of ours is more neutral than the daily transport of steel, ore, oil, and other war materials into Germany by Sweden, the Soviet Union, and other countries neighboring Germany. The heroic Greek army and the armies of the various exiled governments have provided Britain with invaluable military assistance. Britain's strength has increased without decreasing. This is due to the efforts of the general men and women of Britain, who value freedom even more than their lives. I firmly believe that the Warring Nations cannot win. This belief of mine is based on the most recent and detailed information. We cannot forgive those who advocate failure. We have various reasons to hope for justice and peace, to defend our civilization, and to build a more perfect 'civilization' in the future."</p>
<p>Seducing a Virgin</p>
<p>Huang Qingyu (55 years old), a Shaoxing native residing at 43 Rue Pére Robert, has a daughter named Xia Lan, 19 years old, who is beautiful. On December 17th of last year, she went out shopping at 9:00 AM and was lured by Yu Ahua, a clerk from the Fangxinji jute bag shop at No. 33 next door, to the Fair Hotel at the entrance of Baoyu Lane, Rue Edward VII. After spending the night in room 301, Yu's boss, Fang Xinzong, helped Yu to arrange a marriage and took her to the Taiping Hotel on Taiping Bridge and the Fuxin Hotel on Kangti Road for four consecutive nights. After Huang lost his daughter, he searched everywhere without a trace. It was not until the 22nd of the same month that his daughter escaped from the hotel under a pretext and told her grandmother about being seduced. She was sent back after someone was sent to tell her about the seduction. After Huang inquired his daughter, he learned about the situation. His daughter had already been promised to someone, and now she was seduced by Yu and others. He was shocked and reported to the French police station, requesting an investigation. The police chief sent detectives to arrest Yu and Fang for interrogation and sent the girl to the hospital for examination. The hymen had already been broken, so it was not accepted. Both parties were asked to go out and negotiate on their own. At this point, Huang was unwilling to submit and has hired lawyer Du Xi to proceed with negotiations and lawsuits according to law.</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue: The Reform of China's Financial Institutions After the War by Wang Yutong</p>
<p>Since the currency system reform in 1935, China's entire financial situation has made significant progress, and the effectiveness has been greatly demonstrated. Since the military uprising, more than three years have passed, and the government has promulgated various supplementary financial regulations, so the financial institutions have become stable. This has long been praised by Chinese and foreigners. A few years ago, in order to strengthen the central financial institutions, the financial authorities organized a joint office of the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong. The purpose of this organization is to use the convenience of the four banks' branches to make China's financial bloodline and financial administration closely connected. When changes occur in local finance, the four banks have the opportunity to contribute their opinions at any time; and when the Ministry of Finance has emergency financial measures, the four banks can also be the government's executive agency at any time, making the wartime financial foundation more solid than a rock. All of this is a major plan that the current government is painstakingly worried about to cope with the environment. Now that the light has begun to appear, and the dawn is not far away, how should the financial system be rebuilt in the future to adapt to post-war China? In today's view, it is urgent to prepare for a rainy day and study it in time. Is its importance less than wartime finance?</p>
<p>I believe that the biggest shortcomings of China's past financial system lie in its dispersion and lack of system. Government banks have suffered from their own weak strength and have not been able to fully perform their regulatory functions at any time, while general commercial banks have also been self-governing and have failed to fully cooperate with government banks. Therefore, in peacetime, if a financial crisis is encountered, there is always a lack of a center for liaison, which makes the crisis easily tend to expand and endanger the social economy. Therefore, the promulgation of the legal tender policy is recognized by all parties as a manifestation of the financial authorities' long-term vision and thorough determination to rectify the financial system. Although there were many internal and external obstacles at that time, the government's perseverance in promoting it eventually led to success, and it was able to calmly cope with the financial situation in the early stages of the war. As the war gradually expanded, the government successively promulgated various financial measures and regulations to keep wartime finance stable, complementing military affairs and avoiding the government's worries. All of this is only a statement of the current situation; now, I would like to offer seven points on the issue of the reconstruction of China's financial system after the war, based on my limited knowledge:</p>
<p>The Formation of the Financial System and the Establishment of the Bank Specialization System</p>
<p>The establishment of financial institutions depends first on the formation of the financial system and the establishment of the bank specialization system. China's banks and the entire financial organization have not yet reached a healthy stage of development. There are no individual specialized advancement goals, and there is a lack of mutual coordination and regulation. The names of the banks appear to be different on the surface, but in terms of the channels for their capital utilization, except for the specialized special banks set up by the government, they all tend to take the same path, and industries such as agriculture, industry, mining, and animal husbandry that are waiting for relief lack opportunities for financial accommodation. On the one hand, there is also a lack of common adjustment between the central bank and general banks. Therefore, the entire financial organization must be redistributed. The central bank must be made to occupy the central position of the national finance, and professional banks such as agriculture, industry, mining, and international trade, general banks, savings banks, postal savings bureaus, trust companies, insurance companies, and various industrial and commercial organizations must be made its veins, so that the national financial organization can be given considerable functions for both public and private economies, whether in terms of regional distribution or industrial connection. The specialization system has long been established in various countries, and although China has also followed suit, it is actually a misnomer and should be thoroughly promoted. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Commercial Finance: handled by general commercial banks. Its tasks are:</p>
<p>(1) Adjust the turnover of commercial finance</p>
<p>(2) Accept commercial deposits</p>
<p>(3) Mortgage loans for commercial goods</p>
<p>(4) Commercial credit loans</p>
<p>(5) Discount loans for commercial bills</p>
<p>(6) Commercial import and export bills</p>
<p>(7) Other commercial businesses</p>
<p>2.  Exchange Finance or Trade Finance: handled by international exchange banks. Its tasks are:</p>
<p>(1) Manage exchange balance international trade</p>
<p>(2) Set exchange rates and sell foreign exchange</p>
<p>(3) Transport legal tender and sell domestic exchange</p>
<p>(4) Import and export bills for domestic and foreign goods</p>
<p>(5) Buy and sell foreign currencies to balance the exchange fund</p>
<p>(6) Accept interbank deposits and manage bill exchange</p>
<p>(7) Other exchange tasks</p>
<p>3.  Industrial Finance: handled by industrial banks. Its tasks are:</p>
<p>(1) Construction and financial accommodation of transportation</p>
<p>(2) Development and capital planning and financial accommodation of forestry, mining, fishing, and animal husbandry</p>
<p>(3) Supervise the progress of each of these businesses</p>
<p>(4) Accept deposits from each of these businesses</p>
<p>(5) Manage the issuance, fundraising, and sales of stocks and bonds of each of these businesses</p>
<p>(6) Review the reports</p>

<h3>German Newspaper's View: Air Force Assisting Italy, Showing Axis Powers Can Still Fight Side-by-Side</h3>
<p>Hamburg: The "Hamburger Fremdenblatt" commented yesterday on the deployment of the German Air Force to assist Italy, stating that the British military's view that the military measures of the Axis countries on the two battle lines cannot be completely consistent has now been shattered. The dispatch of the German Air Force to Italy shows that the battlefield between Gibraltar and the Suez Canal now has significant importance. Britain's current military action is to spy on the weakness of the Mediterranean in an attempt to reverse its unfavorable position, but it will eventually be defeated by the joint action of Germany and Italy.

<h3>Italy Vigorously Seeking to Continue the War: Emergency Conscription Law Formulated by the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Rome: It is announced here that the Italian cabinet, after hearing the speech of Prime Minister Mussolini, yesterday formulated an emergency conscription bill, which shows that Italy is eagerly seeking to continue the war. The bill stipulates that the training of naval officers will be accelerated, and officers who have never been conscripted before will be summoned to serve in the air force and engineering corps. Many of these officers are over the age limit for military service. The bill also stipulates that the pensions for the widows and orphans of Italian soldiers killed in battle will be doubled, and the prices of various medicines have been decided by the cabinet. At the same time, according to a government order carried by Italian officials, the appropriation for the Ministry of Interior will be increased by 17 million lire this year, which will be used for "political investigation" expenses.

<h3>Southern Ireland and Germany May Break off Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Dublin: It is generally believed that after Southern Ireland obtained new evidence of the German bombing of the Dublin area last night, if Germany fails to give a satisfactory reply to Southern Ireland's protest and stop the bombing, Southern Ireland may break off diplomatic relations with Germany. After Southern Ireland was extensively bombed in various districts on Saturday, the Irish government lodged a formal protest with the German government, because neutral Southern Ireland has been subjected to air raids for several days, which has reached a climax. After the magnetic mines discovered in the Dublin area were positively identified as coming from the German side, the recent trend has been to blame German warplanes. Observers here claim that Hitler is using bombing to force Southern Ireland into the arms of Britain, and every Nazi bomb dropped on Irish territory will increase the possibility of Southern Ireland agreeing to use its ports as naval bases for Britain. This plan was originally rejected by Prime Minister de Valera, but since the German bombing, some senior Irish officials believe that Southern Ireland's neutrality will no longer be maintained. It is pointed out that if Britain can obtain Irish ports, it can give Britain a weapon to resist the threat of German submarines and German ships. Since the outbreak of the European war, the losses of British ships have made Britain feel threatened, which has been formally recognized by some British government officials.

<h3>Soviet Union Raises Education Level</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Pravda commented, "The education level of the Soviet people is increasing every year, and countless young men and women graduate from higher education institutions every year and are scattered in factories and institutions. The number of scientific institutions has also increased. In 1939, there were 694 scientific institutions nationwide, which increased to 772 last year. A year ago, there were 46,000 public libraries in the Soviet Union. In terms of art, Belarus and the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Republic made great achievements last year. Recently, music festivals have been held in various cities in the Soviet Union, and an art exhibition will be held soon. The masterpieces of all Soviet artists in the past 23 years will be exhibited publicly. This year, the new Baltic republics will also hold art festivals. In short, the culture of the Soviet Union in 1941 will be even more developed. (TASS News Agency dispatch on the 5th)</p>
