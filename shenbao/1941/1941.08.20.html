<h3 id="c4">南進歟？北進歟？ <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>僅從各方面的軍隊調動與種種積極準備上看，似乎目前的遠東形勢，比之近年來任何時候，都要緊張得多。日本南進或北進的兩個可能，現在好像已經同時出現於動盪的國際舞台之上。可是按之實際，日本無論在南太平洋上的冒險機會，或在西伯利亞及外蒙一帶進行大戰的環境，當前却顯然的，都在最困難最危險的階段之中。所以推測起來，日本近時在南北兩方面的種種軍事與外交姿態，主要意義，大概還不外三個：（一）對於中，美，英，蘇各强大聯合的最後致命一擊，時時在恐懼着，因而做出種種姿態，一則準備萬一，必要時作困獸之鬥，企圖突出重圍，一則企圖威脅，幻想逼英，美適可而止。（二）結好於德，意，在目前則希望借響應德，義的口號，抬高自己國際地位，在將來，則夢想着德，義的勝利，先下一着，以便屆時瓜分太平洋與西伯利亞贓物的一部。（三）還另有一點很重要的對內意義。牠除了想借向外的擴張姿態，掩飾　蘇，德戰爆發而顯露的外交空前窘境外，同時，也在企圖彌縫對中國血戰四年的徒勞無功的罪過；以為這樣就可造成牠本國人民的幻覺，誤認牠在國際外交上，依然頭頭是道，而在軍事上，也還能南北遊刃有餘。</p>
<p>可是不管日本當局的用意如何，客觀上，牠祗需再進一步，立刻就要遭到列强的總攻，而在這樣的一個總攻裏，日本所賭的，將絕不是向外擴張的，所謂「南進政策」與「北進政策」的成敗，而將是牠本身國家民族的前途了！</p>
<p>値得特別指陳的，目前國際形勢中最微妙的一點，就是在日本現在對外發動新冒險的途程上，「南進」與「北進」之間，並不發生很大的區別。本來依照日本傳統說法，所謂「南進」也者，是由太平洋上南向發展，控制及奪取英，法，荷等國屬地，而暫時擱置奪取西伯利亞的野心。所謂「北進」，則是攻擊海參崴西伯利亞，暫且緩和對英，美各列强的關係。這些年來日本國內爭辯不已的，也就是這兩者孰先孰後的得失問題，而並不涉及兩者的根本應否存在。現在呢，這一個孰先孰後的得失問題，總算由中，美，英，蘇等國的表示與舉措，予以最明確的解答。日本今天北進，希望中，英，美等國袖手坐視，固然是絕不可能的夢想；同樣的，如果牠竟然大舉南下，與英，荷正面衝突起來的話，那末，中，美兩國的立刻動作自不必說，即使蘇聯駐紮東方的全部海，陸，空軍，為了響應牠的同盟者，也必然會向日本撲去。所以日本今天面對着的嚴重問題，並不是向外擴張政策的方向，而是這種整個擴張政策的究竟繼續推行與否。如果牠再瘋狂地向外侵進一步，那末，不問在任何一方面先爆發戰爭，牠總必須在四面八方，海裏，陸上，和空中，與幾個强大的敵人，同時作戰！南進即北進，一髮動全身，這是目前遠東最根本的形勢，而為東方侵略者沒有投入新冒險之前，所不得不加以三思的。</p>
<p>當然，我們所最不能忽略的，却是向來日本所謂「南進」或「北進」口號在國際政治及外交上的作用。一方面，牠利用國際均勢原則下各列强間的矛盾，另一面，牠尤其是利用了社會與資本主義之間的衝突，在外交上運用着種種縱橫椑阖的技倆。當他高唱「北進」時，實際上，牠往往意在懈怠當時英·美·法等國的警戒，並取得牠們對牠侵略行為的容忍與曲恕；但一到牠強調「南進」口號時，則竟然是企圖誘引蘇聯對牠的侵略行為，採取袖手的態度了。前者最適當的例子，是日本一九三一年的強佔東三省，後者則去年侵入越南的事件，就是一個很好的具體說明。一直到這次德，蘇戰事爆發之後，國際上，大家方算完全認淸了日本與德，義合夥，徹底瓜分全世界的眞意，至於牠其餘的一切口號，僅僅是沒有實際內容的烟幕而已。因為目前在西方，所有正義力量結合的最具體目標，是打倒希特勒主義及恢復歐陸各國的獨立與自由；而在東方，則在消滅侵略暴力，尊重中國的領土主權完整及確保英·美·蘇·荷等國在東方的各種利益。因此牠們已經在世界規模上團結起來，準備進行新世界的建造。</p>
<p>看看日本各方面近來的種種表示，似乎最恐懼的，是美國這支生力軍的强大，使牠畏縮不前。而牠最希望的，則是德國從速突出重圍或擊敗蘇聯，於是又使牠躍躍欲試。但客觀上，牠所恐懼的雖日益擴大而具體，而希望的，却日見是縮小與渺茫了。因此日本現在就祗有徬徨與觀望。南進歟？北進歟？</p>

<h3 id="c73">健全讀者的習慣（一） <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 胡德齡</p>
<p>所謂習慣、並不是說人類生下來就具有的一種天賦、更不是只要一朝一夕就能够養成的一種奇蹟、它是一分又一分地、一寸又一寸地延續起來擴展起來的、習慣的意義、是指動作屢次的取其一致的行徑的傾向、這種傾向、就叫做習慣、例如我們每天閱讀一二小時的書報、久而久之養成習慣、一天不讀書報、仿髴和吸慣了香烟的人、吃了飯未吸香烟的一樣難過、單是去年讀、今年不讀、或是上一個月讀了、而這個月又不讀、或是今天讀了、明天又不讀、這還算不得讀書的習慣、或至少是把這習慣破壞了、究竟怎樣才能健全讀書習慣呢、這是値得注意的、</p>
<p>一·養成自動的能力養成讀書的習慣、先要養成自動的能力、現在有些學生不是爲了心頭上挑着敎師的鞭資和家長的督促的重担才去讀書、就是爲了自己的背脊上負着分數和文憑那樣的贅物才去讀書、他們讀書、並不是自動的、在學的時候、每天未嘗不讀書、也求嘗不按時上課、讀了中學、又進大學、讀書習慣、總該養成了吧、可是一出校鬥、走入社會、把讀書這件車情就忘記了、難道以爲讀書這件事情、只有在學校中才是必要的嗎、這種情形發生的原因、大部分就是沒有自動力、所以我們爲要養成讀書習慣、須先養成自動的能力、</p>
<p>二·規定讀書的紀律讀書的紀律、也很重要、不過這要審度自己的環境和時間去規定的、它並不需要機械的、如果過分的機械了、反於自己身心都米必有利、而且在我們現代的大衆的事實上、也是辦不到的、只要在自己的環境和時間的可能範圍內、把讀書的紀律規定一下、譬如、每天早起一小時讀一小時的書、一個星期讀完一本書、一年也能讀完五十二本、在我們事實上、不一定只早起一小時、能讀一小時的書、假使晚上也能够得一小時的機會、一年豈不是讀得一百多本書嗎、總之、無論工作怎樣忙、抽出一部份的時間去讀書應該不見得怎樣困難</p>
<p>三·擬定讀書的計劃養成讀書習慣、須先養成自動的能力、再拿自動的能力、去規定讀書的紀律、這樣、讀書習慣就會健全起來、不過、我們還耍擬定讀書計劃、各個人的硏究對象不同、並且硏究的時間也不同、讀書計劃究竟應該怎樣擬定、這要看各個特殊情形的、（未完）</p>

<p>— 洪知厂</p>
<p>凡人內心有所快樂，當然出之於笑，不過笑固人人會笑，各有方式不同。有時心裏明明覺得異常悲哀，而對人却又不得不陪着笑臉，這是苦笑。還有人因爲受到了刺激和苦悶，而沒有辦法發洩，於是在笑，痴笑，這種的笑，實際上比哭還要難受；但是換得的不是同情，而是刺人砭骨的冷笑，嗤之以鼻的　笑，甚至是陰險的暗笑，和可怕的獰笑，笑得你毛髮悚然，心驚胆寒。可是這一類的笑，雖然不正當，而對於被笑者尚不致含有十分的惡意，祇有骨子裏一心想損人利已，表面上却一團和氣的呵呵笑，最是毒辣殘酷。唐代的李義府笑裹藏刀，現社會裏就獨多這一類殺人不見血的笑面虎，他們固然向你咪咪地笑，就是奪去了你的身家性命，還是向你嘻嘻地笑。所以朋友，你該防備着笑，因爲笑不一定是愉快的表示呀（移酬助學）</p>

<p>— 蘆鶴</p>
<p>我們常常對於交際廣闊的人，非常羨慕，他終日有朋友與他往來，到處有人歡迎他；而那交際不廣闊的人，在大庭廣衆之問，沒有人與他招呼，或即使有人招呼他，也不過三言兩句就完了，那寂寞之神總是盤住了他，——終日的過着孤獨生活。</p>
<p>我友王君，他是一個著名的交際家，雖在學界，而他的朋友却軍政商工各界都有，他會經向我說過幾條條件，現在我把他寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）對於朋友須有禮貌，愉快精神，與誠懇態度。</p>
<p>（二）對於朋友應該涵養，抑止足以破壞感情的思想的發表</p>
<p>（三）敏捷地察出事情的利害。以便作必要的讓步。</p>
<p>（四）甲友短處，應避免向乙友報告，因恐彼此相傳，失去對你已往的信任。</p>

<p>本埠新閘路　成都路附近，每晨集有不少囊皮小販，營業頗盛。因此梁上君子，乘機活躍。鄙友日前因欲購買拖鞋底一雙，以時間忽促，未及披御長衫，正在選擇問，不料短衫袋中之太陽眼鏡一付，及信封中之法幣三十餘元，一併被小愉扒去，及至覺察，業已逃逸無踪，鄙友因念一般皮販小商，生活大都寒苦，蒙害以致家破人亡者，爲數當屬不少，乃想一破獲之法，於决晨將皮夾滿盛草紙，繫以一綫，連於袋底，至該地佯作購皮　，未及五分鐘，果有一年約三十餘歲之王ＸＸ子身着布短衫褲前來將友之皮夾扒出，不料拉至袋口，始悉皮夾底有綫蓮縫衣袋，正擬放手圖逃，被友一手抓住，扭送新閘捕房，當塲搜出扒竊他人之鈔票數張，並供出同黨多人，當時隨行觀看者，莫不稱快！此亦別開生面之捉賊法也。（酬金移充助學金）</p>

<p>影院裏，兩個西裝靑年佔了三隻雅座，中間一隻還空留着。</p>
<p>位老光生走來：『請問有人嗎？』</p>
<p>『嗯！有人！』乾脆地回答。</p>
<p>一位老太太走來：『這兒有人嗎？』</p>
<p>『　！有！』兩人顯得有些不耐煩。</p>
<p>之後，一位一九四二年式的摩登姑娘走過來：『有人沒有？」銀鈴似的聲音。</p>
<p>『沒有！沒有！…』兩靑年一疊速聲地回答，要不是地位狹小，差一點兒站起來恭迎她。</p>

<p>— 覺慧</p>
<p>提起童話和神話，似乎大家都「不敢」遽爾相信；但用處很多。舉一個例：小孩子哭了，祇消吊起頭髮，貶轉眼睛，像不勝其「不得了」地：『再哭，當心掃帶星㧜你去！』那末立刻生效，比甜的糖和毛辣辣的木棍都靈騐。</p>
<p>外國童話是「盡童皆知」的。什麼魔王攫美人囉，石泥化黃金囉……囉囉。</p>
<p>中國神話也是「盡人皆曉」的：八仙過海，鍾馗捉鬼，孫悟空一個筋斗十萬八千里……等等。</p>
<p>粗看，或許「神」「童」輿「中」「外」格格不入的；假使仔細揣摩一下，我們就能看出通同點來了。就是結果總是正者克邪！光明戰勝黑暗！</p>
<p>使人「不敢」相信的童話尚且如此，何况血淋淋的事實呢；事實更須在童話神話之上。</p>

<p>十一　夜半歌聲</p>
<p>這一下可把秋海棠激得怒火冲天了，因爲他自已是一個內行，學了幾天的人和學了幾個月的人唱出來的戲，當然一聽就可以分辨出來</p>
<p>「這孩子眞可惡！原來並沒有去念書，不知道躲在什麽地方學了幾個月的戲。」他忘記了寒冷，呆呆地站在梅寶睡的那張坑的前面，氣得一句話也說不出來。「怪不得連分數單也沒有。」</p>
<p>他正想伸手把他的女兒打棉被裏揪起來的時候，梅寶的歌聲却突然停止了，祗在臉上透出了很興奮的笑容，閉着眼睛，輕輕地說：</p>
<p>「媽，你聽我唱得好不好？」</p>
<p>秋海棠的手不覺就軟了下去。</p>
<p>「師傳說，至多再學一年就可以上臺了。」　還是不停的呢喃着。「媽，上了臺，第一個月拿到的錢，我就分一半給你，一半給爸爸………」</p>
<p>秋海棠呆呆地看着他那正在做夢的女兒，不知道自已應該怎樣才好；在冬夜裏，混身祗穿了一套大布衫褲，也一些不覺得冷。</p>
<p>「媽，再唱一段三娘敎子好小好？」梅寶的右手，從棉被裏仲出來，做了一個喝茶的姿勢，接着果然又唱起來了。</p>
<p>「王春娥，聽一言，喜從天降。原來是，我老爺，轉回家鄉。人人說，我夫君，開封命喪。那有個，人死後，他又能够還鄉？莫不是，……」</p>
<p>秋海棠慢慢地退回自己的坑上去坐着，怒火是完全消失了，反側着臉，靜靜地聽完了梅寶的一大段南梆子。</p>
<p>「可惜字眼和耍腔都不對！」他連連搖着頭說。（一八九）（第十一節完）</p>

<p>— 源深</p>
<p>話劇的「風波亭」，曾給我以很好的印象，所以看申曲的「風波亭」，也感覺到特殊的興趣了。</p>
<p>故事寫岳飛的精忠報國。自開幕至閉慕，觀衆的靈感，是「一直給「正義」二個字支配着的，誰愛護國家，誰出賣靈魂，大家都看得淸淸楚楚，明明白白。</p>
<p>顧月珍飾銀瓶娘，最見成功，她的氣槪，與唐若靑相妨，說一句話，走一步路，是那麽雄糾糾，氣昂昂，眞不愧是巾幗英雄。</p>
<p>解洪元的岳飛，唱做並重，出塲的時候，忠氣溢於言表，我的一顆心，也不覺爲其震動，最後看到三次重刑，掉下眼淚來了。</p>
<p>張谷聲演周三畏，是大理寺之正堂，奉公守法，爲官淸正，以岳飛有功於社稷，無罪於國家，不願判罪，掛冠而去，這一幕，也是很精彩的。</p>
<p>其他如金耕泉的秦檢，兪麟童的牛皐，朱彬聲的岳雲，孔嘉賓的張保，小谷聲的張憲等，都能稱職。</p>
<p>有一點是値得注意的，申曲的「風波亭」，在布景，燈光，道具，化裝各方面，似乎都下過一番苦功，與話劇相較，有過之無不及。</p>
<p>是劇唱詞，由胡知非造句，戈戈陳明勳編劇，夏天，舒適導演。</p>
<p>這是申曲走上新的途徑的開端，以前我們看的，不是「托終身」，便是「中狀元」，現在趨向「愛國」，「愛民」的思想的灌輸，那自然是一種有希望的進步。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Far East Powder Keg is About to Explode - The U.S. Adopts a Tough Stance Against Japan - U.S. Diplomatic Negotiations to Prevent Withdrawal of Nationals Underway, China and the U.S. Unhappy with Japan's Explanation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reuter’s, Washington, 19th: As the fuse of the Far East powder keg is about to ignite, Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that Japan has not given a satisfactory explanation for refusing to allow over one hundred American nationals to leave Japan. Hull's stance indicates that Japan's actions have rapidly developed into an "alarming event," threatening the already fragile diplomatic relations between the two countries. Hull did not elaborate on the content of Japan's explanation, only saying that it was unsatisfactory. It is recalled that Japanese sources here believed that the American nationals were being held hostage pending U.S. approval for Japanese nationals to leave the United States. Hull refused to discuss Japan's new order preventing all foreigners from leaving Japan without special permission. He hinted that he might later comment on the meeting between U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew and Japanese Foreign Minister Toyota yesterday, but said that he had not yet received Grew's report on the meeting. Commenting on his long talk with President Roosevelt, Hull said that all geographical areas in the world were included, but he declined to specify which area received the most attention.</p>
<p>Reuter’s, Tokyo, 19th: Reliable sources here said yesterday that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew, in his meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Toyota, reiterated Hull's statement that the U.S. policy towards Japan will not change unless Japan fundamentally changes its policy in the Pacific. Grew's meeting with Toyota yesterday was their longest meeting to date. Grew's visit followed Japan's attempt to seek some basis for restoring commerce. However, Grew pointed out that the current economic situation was merely the result of political developments in the Far East, and therefore could not be changed under the current circumstances. It is now known that the Foreign Ministry has protested against Secretary of State Hull's recent announcement regarding the "President Coolidge" ship. The Foreign Ministry stated that the statement, which implied that American nationals were being held hostage by Japan, misrepresented Japan's position. The Foreign Ministry said that the fact that Japan refused to allow the "President Coolidge" ship to dock in Japan to pick up Americans was based on two main reasons: (1) Japan was unwilling to take any sensational withdrawal actions for fear of inciting the emotions of the American people; (2) The United States was unwilling to guarantee that Japanese ships would sail to the United States for economically favorable voyages. It is widely believed that the Foreign Ministry will soon issue a statement clarifying Japan's views on the "Coolidge" incident.</p>
<p>Australia and Malaya Are Fully Prepared to Deal with the South Pacific Crisis</p>
<p>Reuter’s, Singapore, 9th: The atmosphere in Singapore remains tense. Japanese radio stations are intensifying their propaganda in various languages, claiming that Britain and the United States are encircling Japan, and that Malaya's increased defenses are a direct threat to Thailand. The Japanese intention is nothing more than to induce Thailand to seek protection from Japan, so that Japan can take the opportunity to occupy Thailand. British people who have withdrawn from Vietnam to Singapore report that Vietnam has become a military camp, with heavy troops stationed on the Burmese-Thai border. At the same time, a certain spokesman for the Japanese Navy even pointed out that the current situation is the calm before a major storm. Those who hear it feel the seriousness of the situation even more, but are not worried, because they see that Malaya is prepared for the worst and has the determination to protect the area. Australian, Indian, British, Scottish, and Malay troops can be seen everywhere here, which is also a confirmation that Malaya is taking precautions. It is also expected that the Thai people may not readily submit to Japanese aggression, and will fight if necessary. Bangkok Radio recently criticized the British statement that the British government had not made any demands on Thailand, saying that the Thai government's statement that the British had not made any demands proved this. Recently, someone from Thailand told the Reuter's reporter that a war in the Far East is inevitable, but when it will break out depends on whether Japan will wait for Thailand to be intimidated by Japan's psychological warfare and allow Japanese troops to pass through, or whether it will wait until the troops gathered on the Thai-Vietnamese border reach the point where they can launch an attack. This is the question.</p>
<p>Reuter’s, Victoria, British Columbia, 19th: Major General Grasett, who has served as the commander of the British forces in China for the past two and a half years, said on his way from Hong Kong to London that Malaya's position is now extremely strong, and anyone who dares to seize Singapore will find the task difficult. In his opinion, unless Japan is insane, it will not rashly go to war with Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Reuter’s, Melbourne, 19th: Australian Air Minister McEwen said yesterday that by May or June of next year, there will be as many as twenty-three Australian Air Force squadrons serving overseas. Most of their pilots are trained in accordance with the British Empire Air Training Scheme and are able to fly the latest aircraft. Australian Aircraft Production Minister Leckie, after stating the combat record of Australian-made Beaufort aircraft, said that it is sufficient to show the strike power of Australia's first line of defense.</p>
<p>Reuter’s, Singapore, 19th: The new commander-in-chief of the Australian domestic forces, Major General Mackay, passed through here yesterday on his way to Australia to take office. He told the Reuter's reporter that everything in the Middle East is fine, the local situation has improved, and the troops are ready to go to any front to fight.</p>
<p>Reuter’s, Melbourne, 19th: According to authoritative sources here, Australian Prime Minister Menzies will give a brief report to Parliament on the seriousness of the Far East crisis on the 20th of this month, and then hold a meeting to listen to more detailed information, which may also include any undisclosed information about the Rowell Conference. It is expected that regarding Menzies' visit to London, he will only present the cabinet's unanimous decision announcement. Regarding this matter, Parliament will pass a decision on the 20th of this month after the party meeting. Some quarters have expressed support for the suggestion that Opposition Leader Curtin should accompany Menzies. The Labor Party has accused Menzies of exaggerating the so-called major crisis in the Far East for political purposes, intending to use this to approve his face-saving trip to London before Menzies resigns. Menzies replied that the facts are clear, and his request is only for the instruction of the Australian people.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Barter Agreement - Negotiations Underway Between Britain and Japan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Reuter’s, Singapore, 19th: The Japanese-run "Daobao" quoted Japanese business circles yesterday as saying that the negotiations between Britain and Japan in London to "establish a temporary barter system" are nearing completion. The negotiations are intended to allow Britain and Japan to exchange necessary goods within the validity period of the freeze order. The newspaper said that the agreement is limited to non-military goods, such as Indian cotton, Australian wool, and various Malaysian products. Japan will use food, cement, and textiles for exchange. The newspaper said that the Bank of England and the Yokohama Specie Bank will set up clearing accounts for clearing.

<h3 id="e3">Japanese Explanation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Reuter’s, Tokyo, 19th: A spokesman for the Cabinet Information Bureau issued a statement to supplement his previous conversation with reporters, saying that the Japanese government has no intention of holding American nationals hostage. The spokesman refused to elaborate on what kind of issue the requirement for American nationals and other foreigners to obtain permission to leave Japan was related to, but said that it did not include trade, politics, or other international issues between Japan and the United States. The spokesman pointed out that the Ministry of Home Affairs' order issued on the 15th to restrict the entry, residence, and departure of foreigners is implemented on nationals of all countries, and that this measure is no different from the wartime regulations that many warring countries have already implemented to restrict the movement of foreigners. The spokesman also recalled that Washington had reported that President Roosevelt would soon issue a bulletin stating that all American citizens and foreigners who wish to enter or leave the United States after September 1 must obtain entry and exit permits or equivalent documents. These permits are currently being prepared by the State Department and the Department of Justice. Japan's decision to restrict measures is in line with the steps taken by the United States, and its purpose is to curb the activities of spies, propagandists, fifth columnists, and other travelers who harm national interests. According to Ishii, the deputy spokesman of the Information Bureau, he had told reporters that American nationals could only leave the country after obtaining permission from the Japanese government. As for the fact that the American ship "President Coolidge" did not come to Japan, it was because the American embassy attempted to increase the number of evacuees on the ship, violating the original plan to only carry twenty-one or two American officials. Ishii said that he regretted that the ship did not come to Japan and that the previous agreement was canceled due to the American embassy's failure to keep its promise. He said that the ship would have been greeted with friendship on the day it arrived in Yokohama from Shanghai. Ishii also announced that the American embassy had contacted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying that twenty-two American officials, including nine diplomats, had arrived in Japan via Siberia and requested to return to their country on the "President Coolidge" ship. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs agreed, but only on the condition that it only carry the twenty-two people on board. However, the embassy later violated the original promise and increased the number of people returning to the country on the ship to more than twenty-two, so the Japanese authorities insisted on adhering to the original agreement, saying that it could not be allowed. Ishii did not announce the number of people added by the American side, but according to a foreign newspaper report, one hundred American nationals were willing to return to their country on the ship.</p>
<p>Japan Cannot Ignore U.S. Material Aid to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>When a reporter asked about Japan's attitude towards the United States transporting goods to Vladivostok, Ishii replied that there has been no change since he gave his first speech when the Soviet-German war broke out. We are willing to maintain peace in East Asia, so we cannot turn a blind eye to the transportation of a large number of military materials to neighboring countries. American diplomacy should have its subtleties. Japan is now watching the situation with great concern. Someone also asked about Japan's possible attitude towards the rumored British, American, and Soviet military alliance, and whether this alliance would violate the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact. Ishii replied that this remains to be seen. Regarding Japan's attitude towards the British and American declaration, Ishii said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying it. Finally, someone asked about Japan's attitude towards the ABCD encirclement. Ishii replied that this is of a defensive nature, and U.S. Secretary of State Hull also said that the U.S. attitude is defensive.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e4">Southward Advance? Or Northward Advance? <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Judging solely from the troop movements and various active preparations on all sides, the current situation in the Far East appears more tense than at any time in recent years. The two possibilities of Japan advancing south or north now seem to have appeared simultaneously on the turbulent international stage. However, in reality, Japan's opportunities for adventure in the South Pacific, or the environment for conducting a major war in Siberia and Outer Mongolia, are clearly in the most difficult and dangerous stages at present. Therefore, in speculation, the main significance of Japan's recent military and diplomatic postures in both the north and the south is probably no more than three things: (1) It is constantly fearing the final fatal blow from the powerful alliance of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, and therefore is making various gestures, on the one hand, preparing for a desperate struggle if necessary, attempting to break through the encirclement, and on the other hand, attempting to threaten, fantasizing about forcing Britain and the United States to stop at the right time. (2) It is trying to befriend Germany and Italy, hoping to raise its international status by responding to the slogans of Germany and Italy, and in the future, dreaming of the victory of Germany and Italy, to make a move first, so as to divide a part of the spoils of the Pacific and Siberia at that time. (3) There is also another very important internal significance. In addition to wanting to use the outward expansion posture to cover up the unprecedented diplomatic embarrassment revealed by the outbreak of the Soviet-German war, it is also attempting to cover up the futile crime of four years of bloody war against China; thinking that this will create an illusion for its own people, mistakenly believing that it is still doing well in international diplomacy, and that it can still be both north and south in military affairs.</p>
<p>But no matter what Japan's intentions are, objectively, it only needs to take one more step to immediately face the general attack of the great powers, and in such a general attack, what Japan is betting on will definitely not be the success or failure of the so-called "Southward Advance Policy" and "Northward Advance Policy" of outward expansion, but the future of its own nation!</p>
<p>What is particularly worth pointing out is that the most subtle point in the current international situation is that in Japan's current path of launching new adventures to the outside world, there is not a big difference between "Southward Advance" and "Northward Advance." Originally, according to Japanese tradition, the so-called "Southward Advance" was to develop southward in the Pacific, control and seize the territories of Britain, France, the Netherlands, etc., and temporarily shelve the ambition to seize Siberia. The so-called "Northward Advance" was to attack Vladivostok Siberia and temporarily ease relations with Britain, the United States, and other powers. For these years, what has been debated endlessly in Japan is the gains and losses of which of these two should come first, and does not involve whether the existence of the two is fundamentally necessary. Now, this question of the gains and losses of which should come first has finally been given the most explicit answer by the expressions and actions of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and other countries. It is certainly an impossible dream for Japan to advance north today, hoping that China, Britain, the United States, and other countries will sit idly by; similarly, if it actually moves south on a large scale and comes into direct conflict with Britain and the Netherlands, then, needless to say, the immediate actions of China and the United States, even the entire sea, land, and air forces of the Soviet Union stationed in the East will inevitably pounce on Japan in order to respond to its allies. Therefore, the serious problem facing Japan today is not the direction of the outward expansion policy, but whether the entire expansion policy should continue to be implemented. If it crazily invades outward another step, then, no matter which side war breaks out first, it must fight at the same time with several powerful enemies in all directions, at sea, on land, and in the air! Southward advance is northward advance, one move triggers the whole body, this is the most fundamental situation in the Far East at present, and the eastern aggressor must think three times before embarking on a new adventure.</p>
<p>Of course, what we cannot ignore most is the role of Japan's so-called "Southward Advance" or "Northward Advance" slogans in international politics and diplomacy. On the one hand, it uses the contradictions between the great powers under the principle of international balance of power, and on the other hand, it especially uses the conflict between society and capitalism, using various tactics of vertical and horizontal manipulation in diplomacy. When it sings the "Northward Advance," in reality, it often intends to relax the vigilance of Britain, the United States, France, and other countries at that time, and obtain their tolerance and forgiveness for its acts of aggression; but when it emphasizes the "Southward Advance" slogan, it actually attempts to induce the Soviet Union to take a hands-off attitude towards its acts of aggression. The most appropriate example of the former is Japan's forcible occupation of the three northeastern provinces in 1931, and the latter is the incident of the invasion of Vietnam last year, which is a good concrete illustration. It was not until the outbreak of the German-Soviet war that everyone in the international community fully recognized Japan's and Germany's and Italy's conspiracy to completely divide the world, and that all its other slogans were merely smoke screens without practical content. Because at present, the most concrete goal of the combination of all righteous forces in the West is to defeat Hitlerism and restore the independence and freedom of the countries of Europe; and in the East, it is to eliminate aggressive violence, respect China's territorial sovereignty and integrity, and ensure the various interests of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and other countries in the East. Therefore, they have already united on a world scale and are preparing to build a new world.</p>
<p>Looking at the various expressions of Japan in recent days, it seems that what it fears most is the power of the United States, a fresh force, which makes it shrink back. And what it hopes most is that Germany will break through the encirclement or defeat the Soviet Union as soon as possible, which makes it eager to try again. But objectively, what it fears is increasingly expanding and becoming concrete, while what it hopes is shrinking and becoming illusory. Therefore, Japan now only has hesitation and watching. Southward advance? Northward advance?</p>
<p>U.S. President Informs Congressional Leaders About the International Situation - Plans to Request More Funds for the Lend-Lease Act - Collect British, American, and Soviet Resources to Resist the Axis</p>
<p>Reuter’s, Washington, 19th: President Roosevelt gathered important congressional leaders and diplomatic figures at the White House yesterday to brief them on the international situation. Those present included Vice President Wallace, Senators Barkley and Connally, and Representatives George and Bloom. After recounting his conversations with British Prime Minister Churchill, the President discussed with those present the matter of continuing to raise funds under the Lend-Lease Act. Those present also informed the President of the recent developments in Congress. Senator Barkley, after leaving the White House for ninety minutes, told reporters that the meeting was very interesting, but very confidential. The issue of continuing to raise funds for the Lend-Lease Act was discussed, and the situation in Japan was only mentioned occasionally.</p>
<p>International News Agency, Washington, 19th: President Roosevelt revealed to congressional leaders yesterday that he plans to collect British, American, and Soviet resources to resist the Nazis. He also said that he will increase the Lend-Lease funds by another $5 billion to be used for the guidelines set by the President and British Prime Minister Churchill at the Atlantic Conference. The President has informed congressional leaders of the general outline of the talks. It is said that the President is quite optimistic about the Soviet Union's resistance and the success or failure of the response of democratic countries. According to the administrator of the Lend-Lease Act, the Soviet Union has stored hundreds of millions of dollars in gold in the United States, so it can buy tanks, airplanes, oil, and other military supplies in cash. If Germany takes action against the French territories in the Western Hemisphere, President Roosevelt will first inquire about the position of the American republics on the occupation of Martinique and French Guiana, and then implement the agreement made with Prime Minister Churchill. (According to recent reports, the United States has suggested to Brazil that it occupy the Portuguese Azores to prevent the Germans from getting their hands on the islands.)</p>
<p>Reuter’s, Washington, 19th: According to the opinions of congressional leaders who participated in yesterday's White House meeting, there is currently an atmosphere that Japan will take new aggressive steps. One senator said that Britain understands that Britain wants to defeat Germany, and that they must invade the European continent, but there are no plans for this action at present. It is said that those present gained the impression after listening to the President's presentation that the Soviet Union has a real opportunity to contain Germany for a long time. The Soviet Union's resistance has destroyed any attempt by Germany to invade Britain this year. The British also believe that the Germans will not be able to launch an attack on Britain until at least next spring. Senator Connally said that he does not believe that the United States has assumed any obligations that would change the United States' position on the war. He feels that the Lend-Lease funds to be continued will be approximately $4 billion, but part of the original $7 billion has not been used.</p>

<p>Reuters, Saigon, 19th - The second contingent of Japanese troops, reportedly slightly smaller than the first, began disembarking here yesterday morning, 24 hours later than scheduled due to strong winds. Some light steel bars were unloaded from the ships, likely for the construction of barracks in eastern Cambodia. Because other locations besides Saigon do not have adequate crane and dock facilities, it is generally expected that Japanese artillery must pass through Saigon, but so far no heavy artillery units have appeared.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 10th - Lieutenant General Sumida, leader of the Japanese military mission to Vietnam, said yesterday that two or three issues regarding the stationing of Japanese troops in Vietnam remained to be resolved. He will soon discuss these issues with Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam, including the demarcation of defense zones between Japanese and French forces.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 19th - Japan's attempt to detach the Dutch East Indies from the ABCD economic group has been met with a cold shower by officials in Batavia. Japan claims that commercial negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies have now resumed, but Batavia Radio says that Japan is continuing to try to alleviate the impression created by the freezing plan adopted when Japanese troops occupied Vietnam. According to a statement from officials here, the Dutch East Indies considers the occupation of Vietnam a direct threat to the Dutch East Indies. All exports from the Dutch East Indies that could materially aid Japan's wartime economy are not in the best interests of the Dutch East Indies and will therefore be stopped. This is beyond question.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Soviet Troops Withdraw from Kinski-Sepp City on the Lielge Front <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>German Elite Division Commander Killed on Eastern Front; Soviet Submarine Sinks German Submarine in the Baltic Sea</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - Soviet troops on the Lielge-led front have withdrawn from Kinski-Sepp City, east of the city. German troops claim to have reached the Nieper River, 80 miles east of Klevoroge, and are advancing towards the industrial city of Jing Pulobeterovsk. Cha Kinski-Sepp, a small town 20 miles east of Nava near the Estonian border, 70 miles southwest of Lielge-led. A communique issued by the Soviet Information Bureau yesterday stated that Soviet troops continued to engage the enemy fiercely along the entire front yesterday. Soviet troops in Kinski-Sepp have withdrawn from the city after fierce fighting. In air battles on August 17, 22 German aircraft were shot down and 18 Soviet aircraft were lost. According to detailed figures received, 25 German aircraft were shot down in air battles on August 16, not 19 as previously reported. Soviet torpedo boats in the Baltic Sea sank a submarine and two enemy transport ships. The German official news agency reported that German troops reached the Nieper River on Sunday morning after a forced march, but did not specify the location. The news agency also stated that German infantry, assisted by tanks and artillery, defeated a small number of Soviet rear guard units that attempted to stop the German advance. German artillery now controls a section of the Nieper River, preventing Soviet troops from crossing the river and retreating. The Berlin Command issued a statement last night stating that the march from Klevoroge has advanced 80 miles east and reached the Nieper River and is advancing towards Niepropetrovsk. The two statements refer to roughly the same battle. The spokesman also said that Soviet resistance was strong, but there will eventually be a day when they can no longer resist the massive pressure of the German army. Although the Soviet Union seems to have inexhaustible manpower and material resources, the German soldiers' determination to win will allow the German army to achieve final victory. The German official news agency also reported that the remnants of four Soviet infantry divisions were ambushed and wiped out by German troops in the Nikolaev area on Sunday. Soviet troops attempted to break through and put up a last resistance along the railway. Soviet corpses were piled up everywhere. The news did not mention the capture of Soviet troops, but Hungary issued a statement last night stating that thousands of Soviet soldiers were captured on the Nikolaev battlefield and a large number of war trophies were seized. Hungarian troops have advanced 120 to 150 miles along the Bug River since August 8, fighting with German troops around Nikolaev. Hungarian motorized troops heavily damaged a larger number of enemy troops in fierce fighting. Hungarian cavalry also stopped the enemy's attempt to break through. The Hungarian radio station said last night and yesterday morning that Soviet aircraft flew over Slovakia and attacked Komorn, 50 miles northwest of the Hungarian capital, dropping 10 bombs, which fell into the Danube River and the suburbs, killing two people. Komorn was ceded to Hungary by Slovakia after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia and is about 600 miles from the nearest Soviet territory.</p>
<p>Tass News Agency, Sweden, 19th - The Hamburger Fremdenblatt reported that General Movon, commander of the German SS elite division, was killed on the Lielge line the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Tass News Agency, Moscow, 19th - The Soviet Information Bureau issued a battle report stating that on the 18th, our army continued to engage in fierce fighting along the entire front. On the Estonian front, our army withdrew from Kinski-Sapura City after fierce resistance.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Moscow, 19th - The front line in the center seems to remain solid. Unconfirmed reports also state that the Red Army has launched a counter-offensive in Smorenesk.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Germany Achieves Partial Victory but Not Enough to Control the Overall Situation <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - A Reuters military commentator said that the war situation in the Soviet territory has shifted slightly in favor of Germany, and the German occupation of Nikolaev at the mouth of the Bug River can be said to be a gain. However, this victory is only partial and cannot determine the overall situation. We have not received detailed reports, so we cannot state how Germany was able to deploy superior troops to the southern end of the Soviet line led by General Budyonny. There are now sufficient signs that Germany must have a larger number of troops in this local battlefield, otherwise it would not be able to drive the Soviet troops to where they have retreated. However, judging from the current situation, German troops in the Kiev area have been contained, their attacks have been repelled, and the German troops advancing towards Moscow and Lielge have also been contained. The Soviet strategy may be governed by the following questions: (1) the number of reserve fresh divisions; (2) whether these fresh troops maintain sufficient equipment, or must wait before they can be supplied with the necessary adequate equipment; (3) how much time it will take to concentrate fresh troops in certain locations and launch a major counter-offensive to drive the German troops out of the country. In the future, it can be determined how long the Soviet commander is prepared to wage a delaying and attrition war before he believes that the time has come to harvest the western German explosive and incendiary shells. Some towns have suffered considerable damage and casualties. A small number of Soviet bombers, departing from the Baltic Sea, were turned back when approaching the coast. One of them attempted to reach Berlin and was also forced to turn back. According to Swiss radio, although the capital issued an air raid warning once, it was likely that Soviet aircraft were invading.</p>
<h3 id="e27">The Soviet Union Temporarily Abandons Nikolaev City to Maintain Combat Power <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 19th - The fall of Nikolaev and Klevoroge is undoubtedly a major setback for the Soviet Union. The former is one of the Soviet Union's main grain ports and has an important naval shipyard, but the shipyard has been destroyed by Soviet troops. This is an important example of the Soviet Union's implementation of a scorched earth policy. The grain normally stored in Nikolaev was probably destroyed long ago. However, the area has been militarily threatened in recent weeks, so it is doubtful whether a large amount of grain was stored there. Germany said that after capturing Klevoroge, the Soviet Union had lost its most important source of iron sand outside the Ural Mountains. This is an exaggeration. The iron sand belt not only meanders to the Nieper River, but also extends far east of the river. Judging from the extent of German progress that has been recognized by all parties, the loss of iron sand is less than a quarter of what Germany claims to have seized. In any case, after the fall of Klevoroge, if Soviet troops must straighten their lines and use the Nieper River Bay as a strong new defense line, they will have to abandon Nikolaev. The commander of the front-line Soviet troops was probably faced with a difficult situation: either try to hold on desperately and cause heavy losses to the army, or abandon an industrial area that is valuable but not indispensable. The Soviet Union clearly prefers to maintain the combat power of its army, on the one hand lengthening the German army's supply lines in order to defeat the enemy's strength, and on the other hand allowing the Soviet Union to calmly deploy in order to delay the time that is an important factor in the war situation.</p>
<h3 id="e28">German Troops in Estonia Launch New Offensive Against the Soviet Union <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th - A Reuters military commentator said that according to news received in London, German troops north of Lake Peipus, launching a new offensive from the Estonian border to invade Lielge, are developing. This may be part of the force that has invaded with Finnish troops. Finnish troops are also active around Koksuom. The area around Smolensk is relatively quiet. There are many signs that German troops in this area are now digging trenches and holding their positions. In the first six weeks, German troops spent a heavy price trying to break through the Soviet lines. Now German troops must have ended this effort. The war situation in the Kiev area has also stabilized. German troops attacking the area from two directions have stopped at Korosten in the northwest and Bilaiya Zokov in the southeast. The center of gravity of the German offensive has shifted to southern Ukraine. However, Soviet troops led by General Budyonny have not had their retreat cut off and continue to hold some positions in the Nieper River Bay. It is too early to say whether German troops will take advantage of the victory to advance on the Nieper River to threaten the Don River coal-producing region. If German troops do this, they will be taking a major risk, because there are still large numbers of troops gathered on the Soviet left flank, and their strength has not been damaged.</p>

<p>Associated Press, Cairo, 19th - An unconfirmed report from a German prisoner of war camp in France to British officials said that Air Force General Göring had both legs blown off during a British Royal Air Force attack on an enemy airfield. But we can still recall recent reports that Göring was under house arrest, which have also been unconfirmed.

<p>Reuters, New York, 19th - A fire broke out on the East River dock downstream from Manhattan Port, where British ships load goods bound for England and Egypt, followed by an explosion that shook the entire city. According to eyewitnesses, the explosion apparently occurred on several barges full of goods. The National Guard and fireboats did not provide assistance. Flames rose as high as 125 feet, threatening to spread to nearby docks used by British ships. All ships loaded were on fire and drifting downstream. Another barge also caught fire and drifted downstream. Fireboats were urgently spraying water to extinguish the fire. The Brooklyn Fire Department received the alarm and sent personnel to block the fire and prevent it from spreading.</p>
<p>National Press Agency, New York, 19th - At the time of yesterday's major fire at the New York dock, about 25 mysterious explosions occurred in the Brooklyn central area, where British military supplies were piled up.

A total of nine people were burned in the fire, and 55 injured people were sent to the hospital. It is estimated that the loss exceeds 1.5 million yuan.</p>

<p>Reuters, Havana, 19th – A series of explosions occurred in several districts here yesterday, resulting in the destruction of one factory, damage to several shops, and injuries to dozens. The city was thrown into chaos. The first bomb exploded in Central Park in the heart of the city, followed by one near Friendship Park, and another in a famous department store on a street with many pedestrians. The explosion near the park caused significant damage, injuring ten people. The windows of nearby shops were shattered, and one pedestrian was seriously injured, while others suffered only minor cuts and bruises. The owner of the department store is rumored to be a supporter of the Cuban fascist movement. A fourth bomb exploded in a building in a residential area of Havana, and a fifth bomb destroyed a factory in the Vobora district, injuring one woman. Explosions also occurred in other districts, causing widespread panic. Police found multiple cards near the explosion sites, bearing the portrait of the late revolutionary leader Guiteras. Authorities have dispatched police teams to patrol the city closely. Some bombs were thrown from speeding cars, causing pedestrians to disappear from the streets, resembling the day when the Machado government bombing case occurred.</p>

<p>United Press, Berlin, 19th – German newspapers yesterday published a message from a propaganda organ stating that British patrol ships, carrying two motor torpedo boats, attempted to land in the English Channel, held by German forces, and across from the Dover Strait during the night.

The British forces then launched mortar fire from a distance, killing several German soldiers on the spot. However, the German forces ultimately repelled the British forces, preventing them from landing. It was also stated that whether the two assault boats were hit is unknown, as it was difficult to confirm in the darkness. It was also said that the British soldiers were lying flat in the boats when the firing occurred, making them difficult to see. They were apparently attempting to conduct armed reconnaissance.</p>

<p>Chongqing – The Executive Yuan meeting on the 19th approved the key points for provinces to compile expenditure estimates for the 31st year. The original text is recorded as follows: Key Points for Provinces to Compile Expenditure Estimates for the 31st Year: (1) The amount of each expenditure category for the 31st year in each province should be based on the budget of the 30th year, and the total amount of expenditure estimates for the 31st year in each province should be allocated for national defense and governed overall. A detailed estimate should be prepared in accordance with the central government's interim budget subject for political affairs expenditures and submitted to the Executive Yuan before September 15th. If it is not submitted by the deadline, the Executive Yuan will refer to the previous year's budget to prepare it on its behalf and send it to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics for compilation. (2) The total amount of expenditure estimates for the 31st year in each province, after being reviewed and approved by the Executive Yuan, will still be included in the national total estimate on a provincial basis. The original estimate will be used as the sub-estimate of the national total estimate. (3) The expenditure estimates for each category of expenditure in the 31st year in each province, except for the first and second reserve funds, will be managed centrally by the central government and do not need to be included. (4) Items such as debt expenditure and general assistance expenditure should be included in the estimate according to the previous year's estimate amount, but will not be subject to additional funding. From the 31st year onwards, these expenditures will be paid directly by the central government. (5) After the first and second reserve fund categories are deleted, a "Provisional Provincial Affairs Expenditure" category may be added as needed based on the actual needs of each province. The amount will be determined separately by the Executive Yuan based on the expenditure amount of each province. (6) For the convenience of handling official affairs, each provincial government may add a "Provincial Government Confidential Expenses" category within administrative expenditures. The amount will be determined and compiled by each province based on the complexity of its political affairs. (7) Each provincial department should list a separate item for "Financial Department Expenses" within financial expenditures. (8) The amount of general subsidies to counties and cities in the 31st year of each province should still be determined according to the subsidy amount of the 30th year and included in the general assistance and subsidy expenditure category. However, those originally listed as central subsidies to the province in the previous year do not need to be included. (8) The expenses for security teams in the 31st year of each province should still be based on the approved expenditure estimate for each province in the 30th year, without any increase or decrease. (9) The total amount of expenditures obtained by referring to the expenditure estimate amount for the 30th year and adding a percentage of increase should be allocated overall according to the various administrative and business expenses originally listed in the 30th year. New facilities to be built in the 31st year that were not included in the budget of the 30th year should be submitted by the competent ministries and commissions separately with plans and estimates and added after approval by the Executive Yuan. (10) For projects to be completed in phases, whose expenses and subsidies are continuous and increase year by year, the original plan should be re-evaluated based on actual needs and current financial resources, and increased or decreased according to the approved amount.

<p>In order to control foreign exchange speculation and stabilize the value of the legal currency, the Stabilization Fund Committee has adopted effective measures to manage the Shanghai foreign exchange market since the day before yesterday (the 18th). This document was sent by the Hong Kong office of the committee, located in the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in Hong Kong, to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in Shanghai, and copied to the other thirteen Allied banks and the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Bank, which are specially authorized to operate foreign exchange. It stipulates that the spot rate for the US dollar will be 5.34375 yuan and will be sold to importers engaged in legitimate trade with China in accordance with General Circular No. 58 of the United States.</p>
<p>Procedures for Applying for Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>A reporter from New Voice News learned from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Bank yesterday that the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are designated to handle matters related to the supply of foreign exchange for the import of essential goods and the settlement of foreign exchange for the export of local goods. The Central Bank and the Farmers Bank of China do not handle business of the same nature. Now, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have stipulated the following procedures for applying for foreign exchange: (1) The import of essential goods from free areas must be approved by the Foreign Exchange Control Committee before they can be sold at the statutory price. However, importers must pay a balancing fee equal to the difference between the statutory price and the commercial exchange rate of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. (2) In the Shanghai concession area, for goods such as rice and coal that are not prohibited, the new exchange rate announced by the Stabilization Fund Committee in Shanghai will be supplied. However, importers must have documentary evidence proving that the foreign exchange purchased is indeed for the import of essential goods and guarantee that it will not be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>Preventing the Import of Luxury Goods</p>
<p>Goods prohibited from import during the emergency period (234 tariff items in 18 groups of customs import items) are strictly prohibited from import and transit. Foreign exchange will absolutely not be supplied for these prohibited items. If the supply is for special purposes to adjust market prices or for other legitimate reasons and is approved by the government, the Ministry of Finance may issue a special purchase permit based on actual needs. It is estimated that over 23 million yuan can be saved annually by calculating the import volume of these luxury and non-essential goods based on the import volume in 1938. This huge amount of foreign exchange expenditure can be used to purchase essential materials for national construction. This is simply a change in the use of foreign exchange in China and a change in the items imported in various countries, which has been fully understood by various Allied countries. If Allied banks in Shanghai supply foreign exchange for these items, they will not be able to replenish it from the Stabilization Fund Committee.</p>
<p>Operating Banks Charge Handling Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai exchange rates stipulated by the Stabilization Fund Committee are: (1) 3 shillings and 16 and 3/8 pence for British pounds; (2) 5 yuan and 32 and 11/16 cents for US dollars. The exchange rates quoted by the British Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation are: (1) 3 shillings and 15.625 pence for British pounds; (2) 5 yuan and 325 cents for US dollars, both of which are 0.03125 short of the exchange rates stipulated by the Stabilization Fund Committee. This 0.03125 is the handling fee for banks engaged in foreign exchange business. Therefore, foreign exchange sold by various Allied banks to importers in the future, if it complies with the provisions of General Circular No. 58 of the United States and is essential for China and is not prohibited from import, may be requested for replenishment from the temporary office of the Hong Kong Stabilization Fund Committee.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Exchange Market Was Extremely Quiet</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" stated that proving this (19th) morning that it is not impossible, but quite difficult, to obtain cheap foreign exchange in Shanghai that is approved by the Chongqing Stabilization Fund Committee for legitimate import into Shanghai. The point about merchants and goods qualifying for cheap foreign exchange from the Stabilization Fund Committee is quite chaotic. The general public hopes that Chongqing will continue to issue detailed instructions. It is heard that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation only does a small amount of exchange business calculated at the new exchange rate for exceptions. Most other banks have not been able to sell foreign exchange at the new exchange rate, and some have even cancelled orders that were concluded at this exchange rate yesterday (the 18th).</p>
<p>Expanded Organization of the Audit Committee</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has decided to expand the existing organization of the Foreign Exchange Audit Committee under its jurisdiction and change it to the Foreign Exchange Control Committee. The chairman is Kong Xiangxi, and the standing committee members are Chen Guangfu, Yu Hongjun, Chen Ding, Bei Songsun, and Xi Demao. The committee members are Wu Tiecheng, Wang Shijie, Zhang Boling, Xu Kan, He Yaozu, Jiang Tingxian, Gu (blank), Li Daonan, and Guo Jinkun. From now on, powers will be centralized for the management of all import and export foreign exchange and the administrative handling of unsealing frozen funds, so that foreign exchange management can be stricter and there is no risk of leakage of frozen funds.</p>
<p>Someone Suggests Absorbing Drafts</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" stated that it is not yet clear which importers are eligible for the new exchange rate. Therefore, all banks in this city that are approved to operate foreign exchange have sent telegrams to inquire. It is unknown whether this method also applies to payments for the British War Fund. It is also unknown whether the Dutch East Indies will follow the United Kingdom and the United States and take measures for legitimate import trade. As for the black market in this city, it will be even more restricted as a result, almost certainly. If the trade operated by the importer is not approved, he will inevitably contact exporters in the black market for settlement. Under this situation, exporters will inevitably wait for a good price to sell. Therefore, someone suggested to various foreign banks to find ways to absorb (this export) drafts to regulate the needs of legitimate importers. However, it is too early to realize this at present, because this measure must be implemented based on a gentleman's agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Amount of Overuse of Electricity Charges Determined to Adopt a Progressive System, Those Who Exceed the Allotted Amount by 10% Will Be Charged 50 Times the Excess <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that, after investigation, the Shanghai Power Company previously presented to the Bureau that it should implement restrictions on electricity users' monthly electricity consumption, not to exceed 70% of the highest electricity consumption in the previous year, and that parts exceeding the limit should be charged six times the current rate, due to the shortage of fuel and uncertain delivery. The company has now reported that the above-mentioned six-fold charging method is obviously not fully effective in terms of saving electricity, because some users have not made a sincere effort to limit their electricity consumption to the allocated amount. Recently, the fuel supply has been deteriorating, so the company believes that the charge for overuse of electricity should be increased immediately, so that the fuel reserves will not be further reduced due to uncooperative users. The company has made the following charging method to the Bureau for suggestion,</p>
<p>Electricity Overuse Charging Method</p>
<p>(A) When the use of all electricity exceeds the above-mentioned allocated amount, the charges are as follows: (1) If the amount exceeds the allocated amount by no more than 2%, the charge will be six times the current rate. (2) If the amount exceeds the allocated amount by more than 2%, but no more than 10%, the excess part of the first 2% will be charged six times, and the remaining part will be charged 20 times. (3) If the amount exceeds the allocated amount by more than 10%, the excess part of the first 2% will be charged six times, the excess part of the next 8% will be charged 20 times, and the remaining part will be charged 50 times. (B) Any user whose maximum monthly electricity consumption is 1,000 degrees or less and needs to exceed 1,000 degrees, the excess part will be charged according to the above method</p>
<p>The Purpose of Limiting Electricity is to Save Fuel</p>
<p>The above method is still temporary in nature, while waiting for the company to negotiate the result of obtaining a larger supply of coal. The company believes that this method is more preferable than the strict electricity saving method specified in the "Electricity Allocation" plan. After discussion by the Bureau, it has been approved and will be implemented from the date of the next meter reading. What needs to be solemnly declared is that the purpose of the aforementioned 20-fold and 50-fold electricity restriction charging method is to prevent users from exceeding their allocated amount, so that the company's fuel will not be further reduced, and will not harm the majority of users of the company who can fully cooperate. The company does not profit from this. All additional fees will still be allocated to the fuel saving reserve fund for uses that are most beneficial to users, as agreed by the Bureau and the company. In addition, please pay attention to the serious situation of fuel supply, and hope that all types of users will do their best to save electricity for their own interests.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Japanese Add Wire Mesh in the Suburbs, Unclear Intentions <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The "Continental News" reported yesterday (18th) that the Japanese authorities are adding wire mesh around Shanghai. Since Sunday, Japanese workers have been installing new wire mesh on the road along Avenue Joffre and the north bank of the Suzhou River near St. John's University to supplement the old wire mesh that is no longer effective. It is unknown where the new wire mesh on the north bank of the Suzhou River extends to. Japanese authorities also said that they do not know the reason for this move. The general public believes that there are two possible reasons for adding wire mesh: one is that the Japanese may intend to follow the example of Tianjin and cut off the supply of goods from the mainland to Shanghai; the other is that the Japanese may just be strengthening defense to prevent people from infiltrating the areas controlled by the Japanese in this city.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Lin Yuji Appealed for a Reduced Sentence <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>United Press of America, Tokyo, 19th – Lin Yuji, the former chairman of the Japanese Residents' Taxpayers Association in Shanghai, who shot and injured Kaimuwei, the former chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, at a special meeting of taxpayers at the Shanghai Racecourse on January 23, was sentenced to one year today, but with a one-year suspended sentence. Lin Yuji also shot and injured Okamoto, the Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. He was originally sentenced to two years of labor and a five-year suspended sentence by a lower Japanese court. He appealed, and today the Nagasaki Court of Appeals sentenced him to one year in prison, with a one-year suspended sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Four Major American Ships Join the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Little Luzon Route, Shipping Committee Orders the Lem Company to Add Four Ships with a Load Capacity of Over 7,000 Tons, Dutch Ship Zhishadani May Come to Shanghai to Evacuate Overseas Chinese <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>In order to closely connect the Far East with Pacific shipping, the U.S. Maritime Commission is now vigorously planning to increase the number of ships sailing to Shanghai, Hong Kong, Manila, and other places. According to foreign shipping industry sources, the U.S. authorities have decided to add four ships originally sailing on the Pacific route of the Lem Shipping Company to specialize in sailing between Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Little Luzon to supplement the shortage of shipping. The names of the four ships are: Carretto, Cardena, Karma Nawa and Kapurna. The above four ships have a load capacity of more than 7,000 tons each. Since then, the tonnage of Far East shipping has increased as a result.</p>
<p>Zhishadani Came to Shanghai to Evacuate Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The situation in the Pacific is gradually tightening and is on the verge of breaking out, and the negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies have not improved. Whether the Dutch ships will still sail to Shanghai is attracting attention from the outside world. However, according to news obtained by reporters from relevant parties, the Zhishadani of the Java Mailboat Company will come to Shanghai at the end of this month in accordance with the original route. At that time, it may carry some of the Dutch and Indian overseas Chinese residing in Shanghai back to their countries. Therefore, first and second class passenger tickets have been suspended for sale, leaving only steerage class seats. In addition, the Tjisalak of the company, which arrived in Shanghai from Java with rice and sugar on Saturday night, is still berthed at the Pootung Blue Funnel Wharf. It has not been notified when it will sail south.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Mechanical Coal Briquette Industry Association sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday. The original letter read: "To the esteemed authorities, since coal briquettes are the fuel necessary for the daily life of citizens, this association, in view of this, earnestly discussed this matter at a meeting of directors and supervisors on the 18th of this month. After a unanimous decision, it is requested that the authorities of the two concessions be informed that the wholesale price of coal briquettes from each factory to each firewood and charcoal store shall not be allowed to increase without the association's official letter. This will benefit the common people and stabilize society. Since the above has been approved, it is hereby informed for your esteemed bureau to follow."</p>
<p>Notice from the French Police Department</p>
<p>The Coal, Firewood and Charcoal Industry Federation announced yesterday: "For notification, it is noted that the coal briquette factory increased the factory price on the 8th of this month. The next day, the French Concession Police Department issued leaflets ordering the retail fuel industry not to increase prices, which caused a price dispute. The association has repeatedly petitioned the authorities. Now, the French Concession Police Department has met and discussed that the retail price of coal briquettes is 16 yuan and 6 jiao in national currency per dan. Other fuels will be sold at market prices. This notice is hereby issued to inform all stores in the industry to operate as usual."</p>

<p>In addition to actively negotiating preferential supply of tap water to reduce the operating costs of its members, the Shanghai Boiled Water Store Industry Association has also notified its more than 500 member companies yesterday to maintain the price of boiled water at 2 fen in national currency per ladle in order to take care of the livelihood of the common people, assist the authorities, and jointly suppress the rise in commodity prices. "In order to take care of the livelihood of the common people, ensure public safety, and prevent members from privately increasing or decreasing the price of boiled water, this association maintains the price of boiled water at 2 fen in national currency per ladle. If there are any unauthorized price increases, please report them in writing at any time. This association will severely crack down on them. This notice is hereby issued."</p>

<p>Announced Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Treating the strike——as a resignation, while simultaneously recruiting four hundred German Jewish men and women to replace the employees. The dining rooms and bars in the three hotels, which were closed due to the strike yesterday, have now reopened. Everything is expected to return to normal in the afternoon. This labor dispute arose because twelve employees of the Cathay Hotel were suspected of being incited to a joint strike by French Club employees. They were arrested by the French police yesterday afternoon, but the labor side only made</p>
<p>One Request</p>
<p>That is, to release the arrested employees, which was not approved, resulting in a stalemate.

<p>Selling Low-Priced Coal Briquettes</p>
<p>The Xiehe Coal Briquette Company serves society with a policy of low-profit sales. Recently, it has been implementing low-priced sales, selling each dan (approx. 100 lbs) for 15 yuan in national currency and each ton for 300 yuan in national currency. It uses high-quality raw materials, has strong firepower, and is long-lasting. It gives special treatment to household users and is exceptionally selfless, providing full weight and guaranteeing returns and exchanges. There is a continuous shortage of daily orders. It is said that telephone orders will have the telephone fee deducted, which is a novel approach. The company's address is 447 North Shansi Road, using the Ruyi trademark.</p>
<p>Hongkou's Strict Quarantine, Many Cafes Close</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that it is heard that in the past month or so, no fewer than 53 small shops run by Japanese merchants and cafes set up by Jewish immigrants in Hongkou have closed due to sluggish business. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy admitted that perhaps a small number of Japanese shops have closed due to business difficulties. It is reported that the Japanese side has implemented strict restrictions on the inspection of epidemic prevention certificates for those entering Hongkou, which has severely affected the cafes set up by Jews in the area this summer. Business has plummeted, and those who could not sustain themselves have closed down one after another.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Astounding Rainfall Yesterday, 43.7 cm in Eight Hours <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, around 9:00 AM, thunder rumbled suddenly in the port, and heavy rain poured down until around 9:15 PM when it began to subside slightly. The intensity of the rain was truly rare. According to records from the Xujiahui Observatory, the rainfall yesterday, from 9:00 AM to 5:15 PM, totaled 43.7 cm. The extent of the rainfall can be imagined. All the roads were flooded due to insufficient drainage, such as Hualong Road, Mercel Tilly Road, Luban Road, Saposai Road, Beller Road, Father Kim Road, etc., along Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, and Beijing Road, Zhejiang Road, Guizhou Road, Guangsi Road, Yinghua Street, etc., in the International Settlement, where the water was knee-deep, trams were stopped, and public buses in the French Concession were rerouted to Route Cardinal Mercier. Areas in western Shanghai such as Route Ghisi Fel and Kangjiaqiao, Yuyuan Road, Difeng Road, Avenue Haig, and Anhua Temple Road had already accumulated water the day before. Because the drainage system in western Shanghai is inadequate, it was unable to drain, so the accumulated water was even deeper yesterday. Public buses have stopped entering, and people relied on rickshaws for transportation. Fortunately, there was no high tide in the Huangpu River yesterday, otherwise, the situation would have been unimaginable.</p>

The trial continued yesterday morning. According to the police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, the suspects initially denied the charges, but due to conclusive evidence, they could not deny it and confessed that they were unemployed and in financial straits, and they knew that the victim was timid, so they designed to send threatening letters under false pretenses. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the situation and, after questioning the two defendants in detail, ordered them to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Zhendong's Registration Revoked, Board of Directors Also Ordered to Dissolve <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) The private Zhendong Elementary School in Yuansheng Lane, Rue Pichon, French Concession, was founded by Fan Yixiong, a native of Yixing. Due to corrupt management, which was beyond repair, Fan privately transferred it to Zai Wucui to take over. When the matter came to the attention of directors Huang Jingwan and Tao Ran, they believed that a school was not a shop that could be transferred, so they published an advertisement in the newspaper to oppose it. At the same time, they prepared to reorganize the board of directors and elect a new principal. At that time, Huang Jingwan and Tao Ran and Wang Wucui slandered each other without reservation, and the newspapers were full of reports, causing a sensation. Subsequently, the education authorities, based on Huang Jingwan's request, appointed director Tao Ran as the principal. Because Fan Chenxiong privately transferred the school, which was indeed illegal and had not been reported, Huang Jingwan and others wanted to maintain the school's lifeline, and their intentions were commendable. Therefore, the school was temporarily approved to be concurrently served by Tao Ran, who would handle the end of the semester and enrollment matters, and Huang Jingwan was ordered to improve the board of directors organization within one month, select a formal principal, and report to the authorities for approval. However, they had not complied for many days beyond the deadline, and had not responded even after repeated reminders. Recently, they also published a notice in the name of the board of directors, saying that the misunderstanding with Wang Wucui in the past had been resolved by lawyer Huang Jingwan and other directors in Liwu's mediation, and that the association had complied with the instructions of the education authorities and implemented the reorganization, and that Tao Ran had also resigned and reported it to the education authorities for record, etc. The education authorities believed that Huang Jingwan and others on the board of directors initially opposed the transfer of the school, then claimed it was a misunderstanding, and finally brought in a private mediator, disregarding the original administrative punishment. Moreover, the reorganized board of directors had not yet been reported for record, and had already re-elected the principal and published a notice on their own authority, saying that it had been reported to the education authorities for record, but in fact, as of yesterday, there was no report whatsoever. Such behavior was obviously playing with the law. After sending personnel for secret investigation, Huang Jingwan and Tao Ran transferred the school privately, just like Fan Chenxiong's transfer, and were guilty of using administrative punishment to obtain personal benefits. It was believed that there was no hope for improvement in the school's future, so an order was issued yesterday to dissolve the school's board of directors and revoke the school's registration. It is hoped that the families of the school's students will quickly order their children to transfer to other schools, because the school's graduates will only be able to take the entrance examinations for middle schools with the qualifications of equivalent academic ability in the future.</p>

<p>The second act of the Shanghai Open Swimming Championships was originally scheduled to be held at the French Chamber of Commerce swimming pool. However, due to a notice of cancellation from the French Chamber of Commerce, the organizing committee decided, and with the generous agreement of the French General Association, that the competition will still be held at the French General Association swimming pool this Saturday. The time will be changed to start at 6:00 PM. Except for the five championship events, all other programs will be canceled. Spectators will be admitted with invitations to limit the number of attendees. Because the number of participants in the three men's events exceeds four, a special preliminary round will be held at the French General Association at 6:00 PM this afternoon. In the 400-meter freestyle, Jia Jun is the favorite to win. He Jin may also put in a good performance. In the 200-meter medley, it is feared that Geben Qiguofu will have no rivals. In the 150-meter, Smith, Wang Zhongren, and Shi Qulai will have a close contest. As there are only two participants in the women's 100-meter freestyle and the men's junior 120-meter freestyle, there will be no preliminary round. The third competition will be held at the Rowing Club on the 30th of this month. Registration closes at noon this Saturday. The list of participants for today's preliminary round is recorded below: (Men's 140-meter Freestyle) He Jin, Jia Jun, Wen Jingling, Geben Qiguofu, Ge Lifi, Stephen, Lioni.

<h3 id="e73">Cultivating Healthy Reading Habits (Part 1) <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Deling</p>
<p>A habit is not an innate talent that humans are born with, nor is it a miracle that can be formed overnight. It is extended and expanded bit by bit, inch by inch. The meaning of habit refers to the tendency of actions to consistently repeat a certain behavior. This tendency is called a habit. For example, if we read books and newspapers for one or two hours every day, we will develop a habit over time. If we don't read books and newspapers for a day, it will be as uncomfortable as a smoker who has not smoked after a meal. Simply reading last year but not this year, or reading last month but not this month, or reading today but not tomorrow, does not count as a reading habit, or at least it destroys the habit. How can we cultivate healthy reading habits? This is worth noting.</p>
<p>1. Develop the Ability to Be Autonomous: To cultivate a reading habit, we must first develop the ability to be autonomous. Some students do not read because they are driven by the teacher's whip or the parents' urging, nor do they read because they are burdened by grades and diplomas. Their reading is not autonomous. When they are in school, they read every day and attend classes on time. They should have developed a reading habit, right? However, once they leave school and enter society, they forget about reading. Do they think that reading is only necessary in school? The reason for this situation is mostly the lack of autonomy. Therefore, in order to cultivate a reading habit, we must first develop the ability to be autonomous.</p>
<p>2. Establish Reading Discipline: Reading discipline is also very important, but it should be determined based on one's own environment and time. It does not need to be mechanical. If it is too mechanical, it may not be beneficial to one's physical and mental health. Moreover, in our modern society, it is also impossible to achieve. As long as we establish a reading discipline within the possible scope of our own environment and time, for example, getting up one hour earlier every day to read for one hour, finishing one book a week, we can also finish fifty-two books in a year. In fact, we don't necessarily have to get up only one hour earlier and read for one hour. If we can also get an hour in the evening, wouldn't we be able to read more than a hundred books a year? In short, no matter how busy we are with work, it shouldn't be too difficult to set aside some time to read.</p>
<p>3. Develop a Reading Plan: To cultivate a reading habit, we must first develop the ability to be autonomous, and then use the ability to be autonomous to establish reading discipline. In this way, reading habits will become healthy. However, we also need to develop a reading plan. Everyone's research object is different, and the research time is also different. How should we develop a reading plan? This depends on individual circumstances. (To be continued)</p>

However, at these prices, speculators still found it difficult to close out their positions or sell. Exporters came to sell export bills of exchange for 5.125 yuan, which were absorbed by American banks. The HSBC small counter US dollar was still at 5.3125 yuan. The silver balancing tax was still levied at 24.25 percent. Bullish Chinese merchants came to close out their positions, and it was heard that they sold August futures at 4.9375 yuan and 96875 yuan, which were also purchased by American banks. The market suddenly softened, and the British exchange rate also tightened to 2 pence 96875 yuan. Transactions became scarce at noon. The closing price at noon was 3 pence for large amounts of British exchange, and 4.875 yuan for US dollars.</p>
<p>British and American Currencies Re-enter the Pass</p>
<p>In the afternoon, for August futures at 4.84375 yuan, a certain account tried to buy in but failed, causing it to soften to 4.8125 yuan, with few transactions. Importers also closed out few positions. The closing price at 3:30 pm was 2 pence 96875 yuan for the British exchange rate and 4.8125 yuan for the US dollar, which was a tightening of 0.046875 yuan for British exchange and 0.21875 yuan for US dollars compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market on the black market rose and fell indefinitely amidst chaos. It started to fall, then suddenly rose sharply, and then meandered and fluctuated. People's hearts were still difficult to stabilize, because there was no official market price for the foreign exchange black market. From the morning opening, it retreated to a low price of 6,690 yuan under the pressure of selling. It was rumored that speculative bulls were closing out their positions against American banks, and the US dollar price was within the 5 yuan range, which stimulated short covering. Amidst the buying from gold shops, securities firms, the Shanghai West gang, and retail investors, it soared by more than 200 yuan, rising to 6,920 yuan. However, the HSBC small counter US dollar was still at 5.3125 yuan, and there was a relationship with the closing price at the end of September, so buyers had concerns. Securities firms came out again, so it moved downward again. In the afternoon, the Shanghai West gang continued to absorb, and the gold shops also came to sell, fluctuating around 6,850 yuan. It ultimately saw a tightening of 60 yuan. The total daily transaction volume was 150,000 taels. Cash also rose by 150 yuan, approaching the 9,000 yuan mark. In the morning, Zhongxing sold 30 taels to Shihe for 8,880 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 8,950 yuan with demand but no supply.</p>
<p>Futures Rebound Sixty Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 6,750 yuan at 9:15, which was 45 yuan lower than the opening. Under the unanimous selling pressure from Hesheng and retail investors, it fell another 60 yuan, dropping to 6,690 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that the foreign exchange black market was because American banks were approving export bills of exchange at 5.125 yuan, and people's hearts were greatly encouraged. Chengji quickly rose to cover short positions. Amidst the buying from Dafeng, Defu, Yida, Xinfeng, Yongyi, Yuanxiang, Xingyong, Shihe, and others, the price suddenly soared by 230 yuan, rising to 6,920 yuan. Defu sold a large amount of stock, and Deda, Dingsheng, Rencheng, and Yongjun sold them. Retail investors also vomited them, and it immediately retreated to the 6,800 yuan mark. The Shanghai West gangs, such as Yiyuan and Yida, absorbed them, and gradually rose to 6,880 yuan, which was sold by Tongkang, Yongsan, and retail investors, pressing it down to 6,810 yuan. The closing price at noon was 6,826 yuan. After closing, Defu and Dafeng sold them, pressing it down to 6,770 yuan. The opening price at 2 pm was 6,780 yuan, 46 yuan lower than the noon closing price. Yiyuan retail investors sold them down to 6,765 yuan. Because it was also difficult to close out the foreign exchange at 4.84375 yuan, Yiyuan re-entered. Xiangxing, Yongda, Dafeng, Yifeng, and Defu competed to enter, and the price gradually rose by 120 yuan, rising to 6,885 yuan. Hesheng, Xianghe, Xinfeng, and Yong sold them down to 6,840 yuan. The closing price at 3:30 pm was 6,855 yuan, a rebound of 60 yuan compared to the previous day's evening closing price. According to the closing price of the September US dollar at 4.8125 yuan, it was 7,236 yuan, a discount of 381 yuan. If it was 6,555 yuan according to the small counter at 5.3125 yuan, then it would be a premium of 300 yuan. Therefore, for (August rolling into September) swap, buyers once paid the seller 140 yuan, and it retreated to 90 yuan in the afternoon. There was a high and low price of 230 yuan that day. After closing, it rose to 6,870 yuan. Finally, there was less supply than demand. The selling price of gold shops' own brand gold at the store was already above 9,000 yuan, with a reduction of 200 yuan for buying in. There was no price or market for the current standard gold.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Also Listed Ten Yuan Higher</p>
<p>Yesterday's buying price for silver building ornamental gold was raised from 910 yuan to 920 yuan by Datongxing and Xintongxing at 3:30, with a reduction of 40 yuan for buying in.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Yarn and Flower - The Yarn Market's Wild Bear Resurges - The Market Remains Unpredictable <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which rose and fell wildly the previous day, has now become stable and is showing a rebound. This is because the market for Japanese yarn and cloth is good, which has boosted people's confidence. However, actual transactions have not developed very much. Transactions for 32-count yarn have also stalled. However, speculators have different opinions. Shorts say that the foreign exchange is calm, while longs say that it is not easy to settle payments without a proper application, and they are optimistic about the yarn price. Others say that if the international situation changes, the yarn market will have a big drop. Therefore, when the market price rises, short selling is active, and conversely, buying is also enthusiastic. In this regard, it is currently still in a volatile and unpredictable state. The high price for 20-count Bianma yarn was 1,710 yuan, and the low price was 1,670 yuan. The market closed in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The opening market for Shuangma in the morning was peaceful. The first board price was 1,670 yuan. It soon rose to 1,688 yuan. It was then heard that the standard gold had softened, and people's confidence loosened again, returning to 1,671 yuan. However, the market was firm when the exchange opened, and it was rumored that Japanese yarn and cloth were being shipped to the East, which tended to rise. For a time, the buying voices revived, and the shouts shook the sky. The market gradually moved forward, reaching 1,710 yuan. However, the sales of spot yarn were not strong, and profits were taken, returning to 1,690 yuan at the closing. According to the statistics of transactions in the first half of the day, 7,210 bales were traded. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below: Hong Kong 190, Tianjin 20, Same Industry 7,000, Statistics 7,230.</p>
<p>The Shuangma futures market went from sluggish to gradually rising, and the situation was extremely positive. Although the opening of the American cotton in the morning was slightly better by one to two yuan, it failed to stimulate people's confidence. Therefore, the general big players initially watched, so the market was almost at a low price of 892 yuan in August and September under the sale by retail investors. The opening price for August futures was 1,486.00, and the opening price for September futures was 580.00, which was better by four yuan. After entering the market, due to the sharp rise of gold prices after the fall, yarn market buyers followed suit, and it was said that a certain big player absorbed factory orders, once reaching 1,710.00. Therefore, the futures yarn counter became tight, and for a time it was shrouded in buying sentiment. The market price rose sharply, and the August and September contracts once broke through the 1,500 yuan and 1,600 yuan marks, respectively. The October contract also reached a high of 1,625 yuan. However, as there were too many floating profits, there was a slight pause, and the closing was slightly smaller. In the afternoon, the August contract was 1,501.00, the September contract was 1,593.00, and the October contract was 1,610.00, which was 11 to 17 yuan higher than yesterday. In the afternoon, because there was no market for factory orders, it was still soft first and then firm. The tilting and squeezing of the long and short positions was very fierce, so it did not break away from the rotating pattern. As a result, the August contract was 1,506.00, and the closing rose by 17 yuan. The September contract was 1,595.00, a good 19 yuan. The October contract was 1,611.00, also rising by as much as 12 yuan. The difference between near and far contracts was as much as 89 to 105 yuan. Looking at the trend, there were many people seeking cotton, and the ground seemed very hard. Therefore, the yarn market is in a fundamentally strong state and should have the possibility of continuing to rise, but those engaged in it must be careful to prevent high-level selling. The August yarn only traded today (20th). From the 21st, the November yarn will be added to the auction. A total of 21,120 bales were traded today, a decrease of 910 bales compared to the previous day. The daily opening, closing, high, and low prices are recorded on the left (net board quotation).</p>

<p>The spot cotton situation is still firm, and those holding the goods are in high spirits, unwilling to sell. Prices are difficult to loosen. However, the source of supply has remained smooth recently. However, the goods in the hands of the same industry have made a great profit, and they will not sell unless the price rises.</p>
<p>In the New York cotton market, the market was flat and lacked features. Because all parties were waiting for President Roosevelt's opinion on the Smith Bill and adopting a wait-and-see attitude, the trading was narrow. As a result, the closing price was about two to three points higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>In the Indian cotton market, prices rose first due to buying by speculators, but subsequently fell slightly due to selling by European exporters and closing by retail investors. As a result, yesterday's closing prices rose two to three rupees each.</p>
<p>It is also predicted that the opening market today will be bearish by half a rupee.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, the market is still firm and high, but the buying intention of all parties has slightly weakened due to the changes in the US dollar exchange rate. At times, they are also temporarily watching due to the frequent application procedures for the Exchange Equalisation Account and the surge in supply. Yesterday, in addition to the spot situation being more lively, the transactions for foreign cotton orders were not as fierce as the previous day.</p>

<p>London, 18th (Monday) Telegram: Today's board market for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks showed a slight improvement in Chinese government bonds. The previous Christal loan rose by half a pound to 30 and a half pounds. The Vickers aircraft loan fell by one pound to eight pounds. The later railway bonds, Beining, Shanghai-Nanjing, and Guangzhou-Kowloon, each rose by two pounds, with Beining at 57 pounds, Shanghai-Nanjing at 17 pounds, and Guangzhou-Kowloon at 13 pounds. The Daokou-Qinghua loan rose by one pound to 19 pounds. The Tianjin-Pukou 6% continued to rise by half a pound each to 12 and a half pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Government bond baking market. Yesterday's market transactions became increasingly reduced, and the market became more sluggish. Both long and short positions were watching each other, and the market was only dotted with scattered transactions by a few retail investors. This is a common phenomenon after interest payments, and it is also because the market prices in other speculative markets are more lively, and most speculators abandon this and go to the other, so the government bond market feels more bleak and dim. There were no changes in the environment that were closely related. The market price was fixed, and transactions were reduced. Yesterday morning, Yixinghao bought in, supplied by Xinhua Lianyi. There were slightly more transactions in the afternoon. Yongchang, Runde, Jiucheng, and Datong bought in, while Tongkang, Jiufeng, Lianhe, and Qia Tai sold them. The market price hovered here, which is quite rare. However, the future changes must be huge, and this time is still in the brewing period. The market price results were that Ding type was still not opened, Jia type had no rise or fall at all, Yi and Bing types were better by five cents each, and Wu type was better by two jiao and a half. The transaction volume was only 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions involved the transaction of 450 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory shares at a price of 37 yuan. Yesterday's report of 8 yuan and five jiao for the Chinese Electrical Stock was mistakenly reported as 9 yuan and five jiao and is now corrected. In addition, the public industry stock exchange in Ningjing was quiet, and prices were stable. Rubber stocks still tended to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Grains: Foreign Rice Finally Slightly Lower Again <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation first declined and then rose, showing a fluctuating pattern. The market inherited the weakness of the previous day and was affected by the new exchange rate, resulting in a sluggish and listless market. Actual sales were cautious, and speculators were nervous. The market price fell by another two or three cents due to retail selling, especially for spot rice. The future price of the Yinghua company was almost unattended. However, almost immediately, the exchange market stabilized, and people's minds became more stable. Speculators stopped selling, and buyers from inland Shanghai West and local customers took the opportunity to absorb the supply. The market immediately turned from weak to brisk. The selling prices of spot rice in various grades immediately rebounded by one or two yuan. The Yinghua company was unwilling to sell freely after selling some. Small-sized packaged rice was initially offered at one hundred and fifty yuan per bag, and spot rice at one hundred and forty-nine and a half yuan. Later, due to brisk demand, they were unwilling to sell freely. Small-sized spot rice from foreign warehouses, which was initially priced as low as one hundred and twenty-three yuan, rose to as high as one hundred and twenty-four and a half yuan. Eastern warehouses, which were initially priced as low as one hundred and twenty-one and a half yuan, rebounded to one hundred and twenty-two and a half yuan and were still shouting for higher prices. All other types of rice experienced a decline followed by a rise. At the close of the market, prices were only slightly lower than the previous day, by a few cents to just over one yuan. However, the transaction volume of spot rice increased to more than 20,000 bags, while Yinghua company only had 500 tons.</p>
<p>Due to the continuous autumn rain, there were concerns that thick and thin japonica rice (Guo Rice) would have water damage upon arrival. The sellers were willing to sell. At the same time, general customers were even more discouraged by the decline in foreign rice. Both retail and wholesale customers in local stores remained inactive, making it difficult to maintain the market. Prices fell by one or two yuan. Early indica rice from Kainang Port was priced at one hundred and twelve and a half yuan to one hundred and fifty yuan. Specially white Wuxi packaged japonica rice was priced at fifty-two or three yuan. First-class city rice was priced at one hundred and forty-eight or nine yuan, and second-class rice was priced at one hundred and forty-three or four yuan. As for new japonica rice from Pudong, sales were hindered by the rain. Only a few loads arrived, so while other goods generally trended downward, it remained firm and maintained its original price. Zhu Yourong sold at one hundred and fifty-eight yuan, and lower quality was sold at one hundred and fifty-six yuan.</p>
<p>The poor situation in the glutinous rice market has also led to a weakening in sales. With only some sporadic demand, the sellers were unable to maintain prices, and prices fell by one yuan. White glutinous rice from 杳港 was priced from one hundred and twenty-nine yuan for top quality to one hundred and twenty-five yuan for lower quality. Special glutinous rice from 糯菉 was priced from one hundred and seventeen yuan to one hundred and fourteen yuan. Domestic glutinous rice was not traded due to a lack of supply.</p>

<p>The price of foreign starch has entered a state of fluctuation. As the supply of starch from local factories is insufficient to meet daily needs, reliance on foreign starch has increased. However, customer sales and stockpiling have decreased. This is because of the long-term depreciation of foreign exchange. Although there are no fixed orders from abroad, people are inevitably discouraged. The market transaction volume was fifteen to sixteen thousand bags. Golden Dragon starch was priced at thirty-three yuan and six to four cents, Fortress starch at thirty-four yuan and seven and a half cents, Banana starch at thirty-four yuan and one cent, and Double Eagle starch at thirty-three yuan and nine cents, with no significant changes. However, due to a shortage of raw materials, the Fufeng factory has already stopped production. Currently, the Fuxin factory occasionally provides a small supply, which is far from meeting the needs of local customers. It is reported that the price of the "Battleship" brand factory starch is thirty-four yuan and seven and a half cents per bag. The factory sold four to five hundred bags. The wheat market is inactive, and the market situation has loosened.</p>

<p>Actual sales of yellow soybeans have declined due to high prices. Furthermore, 300 bags of new soybeans from Changzhou have been shipped to Shanghai, causing people's minds to shift from tight to loose. The market has fallen by about one yuan. Only 400 bags of Qingkou yellow soybeans were traded in the overall market, priced at sixty-one yuan and four to sixty-one yuan. Fifty bags of Guid Yellow Soybeans was priced at sixty yuan. Changzhou Niupi Huang was quoted at sixty yuan and five cents, but the deal was not formally closed.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Laughter <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Zhi Chang</p>
<p>When people feel happy, they naturally express it through laughter. However, while everyone can laugh, their ways of laughing are different. Sometimes, one may feel extremely sad inside, but still have to force a smile on one's face for others. This is a bitter smile. There are also people who laugh due to stimulation and frustration, with no way to vent. This is a foolish laugh, which is actually more painful than crying. But instead of sympathy, it earns one piercing and caustic sneers, scornful laughter, or even insidious snickers and terrifying sinister laughter that makes your hair stand on end and your heart tremble. However, these types of laughter, though improper, do not necessarily contain malicious intent towards the person being laughed at. Only those who wholeheartedly seek to harm others and benefit themselves, while maintaining a facade of amiability with giggling laughter, are the most venomous and cruel. Li Yifu of the Tang Dynasty hid a knife in his smile. Modern society is rife with such smiling tigers who kill without bloodshed. They may smile sweetly at you, but even if they steal your wealth and life, they will still be laughing at you. So, friends, you should be wary of laughter, because laughter is not always a sign of happiness. (Moved remuneration to help students)</p>

<p>— Lu He</p>
<p>We often envy those with wide social circles. They have friends visiting them every day and are welcomed everywhere. Those without wide social circles are ignored in public, or even if someone greets them, it's only a few words. The god of loneliness always clings to them, and they live a solitary life every day.</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Wang, is a famous socialite. Although he is in academia, his friends are in the military, political, business, and industrial sectors. He once told me several conditions, which I will write down below:</p>
<p>(1) Be polite, cheerful, and sincere towards friends.</p>
<p>(2) Be tolerant of friends and suppress the expression of thoughts that could damage the relationship.</p>
<p>(3) Be quick to discern the advantages and disadvantages of things in order to make necessary concessions.</p>
<p>(4) Avoid reporting one friend's shortcomings to another, lest they be passed on and you lose their past trust.</p>
<p>(5) With many friends, there are many opinions. Observe their environment and help them make choices.</p>
<p>(6) In all interactions with friends, prioritize integrity. Complete all assigned tasks on time.</p>
<p>(7) When friends encounter misfortune, offer sympathy and help. When they encounter joy, offer support and congratulations.</p>
<p>(8) In conversations with friends, avoid selfishness. Talk more about your friends and less about yourself.</p>
<p>Making friends is a beautiful thing. We often hear and see many untold stories. They will tell you these stories with relish, expanding our knowledge, showing us the way to goodness, and helping us solve problems. Whether your character is good or bad depends entirely on the friends you make. So, making friends is like studying at a university.</p>

<p>— Ding Haoxiang</p>
<p>Near Xinzha Road and Chengdu Road in this city, many peddlers gather every morning, their business is quite thriving. Therefore, "gentlemen on the beams" take the opportunity to become active. A friend of mine wanted to buy a pair of sandal soles the other day, and he didn't have time to put on his long gown. While he was choosing, a pair of sunglasses and over 30 法幣 (legal tender) in an envelope were stolen from his shirt pocket. By the time he noticed, the thief had already escaped without a trace. My friend thought that most of the leather peddlers lived in poverty, and many families were ruined as a result of being harmed. He wanted to come up with a way to catch the thief. The next morning, he filled his wallet with waste paper, tied it with a string to the bottom of his pocket, and pretended to buy leather there. In less than five minutes, a Wang XX, about thirty years old and wearing a short cloth shirt and pants, came and pulled out my friend's wallet. Unexpectedly, as he pulled it to the pocket opening, he realized that the bottom of the wallet had a string sewn to the pocket. Just as he was about to let go and run away, my friend grabbed him and sent him to the Xinzha police station. Several stolen bills were found on the spot, and he confessed to having several accomplices. Those who were watching at the time couldn't help but cheer! This is also a novel way to catch a thief. (The reward will be used to help students)</p>

<p>— Qiu Hua</p>
<p>In the cinema, two young men in Western suits occupied three comfortable seats, with the middle one left empty.</p>
<p>An old bachelor came over: "Excuse me, is this seat taken?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Taken!" came the curt reply.</p>
<p>An old lady came over: "Is this seat taken?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes!" the two seemed a little impatient.</p>
<p>Then, a 1942-style modern girl came over: "Is this seat taken?" Her voice was like a silver bell.</p>
<p>"No! No!..." The two young men replied in unison, almost standing up to welcome her if the space wasn't too small.</p>
<p>It makes one wonder if the person they had been waiting for was an "unknown" but "beautiful" "girl"!</p>
<p>But the two young men smiled as if their ideal had come true.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Fairy Tales and Myths <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Jue Hui</p>
<p>When it comes to fairy tales and myths, it seems that everyone "dares not" readily believe them; but they are very useful. To give an example: if a child cries, just raise your eyebrows, roll your eyes, and say, with an air of "this is terrible": "If you cry again, be careful the broom star will come and grab you!" That works immediately, more effectively than sweet candy or a prickly stick.</p>
<p>Foreign fairy tales are "known to all children". Like the demon king who snatches beautiful women, turning mud into gold... and so on.</p>
<p>Chinese myths are also "known to all": the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, Zhong Kui catching ghosts, Sun Wukong somersaulting one hundred and eight thousand miles... and so on.</p>
<p>At first glance, perhaps "god" "child" and "Chinese" "foreign" are incompatible; but if we think about it carefully, we can see the common ground. That is, the result is always that the righteous prevail over the evil! Light triumphs over darkness!</p>
<p>If fairy tales that people "dare not" believe are like this, how much more so is the bloody reality; reality must be above fairy tales and myths.</p>

<p>Eleven: Song at Midnight</p>
<p>This made Qiu Haitang furious, because he was an expert himself. He could of course tell the difference between someone who had studied for a few days and someone who had studied for a few months.</p>
<p>"This child is really hateful! So she didn't go to school, and has been hiding somewhere learning opera for a few months." He forgot about the cold, and stood in front of Mei Bao's bed, speechless with anger. "No wonder she didn't even bring back her report card."</p>
<p>Just as he was about to reach out and drag his daughter out from under the quilt, Mei Bao's singing suddenly stopped, and a look of excitement appeared on her face. With her eyes closed, she whispered:</p>
<p>"Mom, do you think I sang well?"</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang's hand unconsciously softened.</p>
<p>"The teacher says I can perform on stage in at most another year," she continued to murmur. "Mom, when I go on stage, I'll give you half of the money I earn in the first month, and half to Dad..."</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang stared blankly at his dreaming daughter, not knowing what to do. He didn't feel the cold at all in the winter night, even though he was only wearing a set of cotton clothes.</p>
<p>"Mom, should I sing another section of 'San Niang Teaches Her Son'?" Mei Bao's right hand reached out from under the quilt, making a tea-drinking gesture, and then she began to sing.</p>
<p>"Wang Chun'e, listen to what I say, joy comes from the sky. It turns out, my lord, has returned to his hometown. Everyone said, my husband, died in Kaifeng. How can someone return home after death? Could it be..."</p>
<p>Qiu Haitang slowly retreated to his own bed and sat down, his anger completely gone. He turned his face away and quietly listened to Mei Bao's long section of "Nan Bangzi."</p>
<p>"Too bad the words and the phrasing are all wrong!" He shook his head again and again. (189) (End of Section Eleven)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Some Common Sense for Sending Letters <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Delin</p>
<p>According to postal statistics, every year there are tens of thousands of undeliverable mails. The reasons for this can be avoidable or unavoidable. If the recipient's address is not detailed enough, the postman cannot deliver it, and the letter will be returned to the sender according to the address on the envelope. If the address is omitted, the letter can only be treated as dead mail - undeliverable mail, which belongs to the former. In our country, there are quite a few places with the same name, which are too numerous to list. Here are some examples: 1. Jiading - Jiangsu, Sichuan. 2. Haimen - Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Guangdong. 3. Haikou - Fujian, Jiangxi, Yunnan, etc. If the name of the province can be added beforehand, a lot of trouble can be avoided, and the time will not be delayed. The postage stamps used for sending letters are often printed with the portraits of martyrs or national heroes. In order to urge the public to pay attention, the government has issued an order throughout the country to avoid sticking them upside down or in a mess, to show respect. Many people who abide by the law do so, but many ignore it. There are also regulations on where to affix postage stamps. For vertical envelopes, it should be on the left corner of the top of the front side; for horizontal envelopes, it should be on the right corner of the top of the front side, so that the postage stamps can be stamped easily, the mail can be delivered quickly, and within the possible range, please use postage stamps of appropriate value. Because the cost of a one-cent postage stamp is almost the face value of the stamp, if you can use one eight-cent stamp, if you use eight one-cent stamps, the post office will have no profit at all. After the war, freight rates are extremely high, so how can the post office not lose money? If the post office loses money, it will inevitably be transferred to the sender, increasing postage. For the sake of benefiting others and oneself, I would like to ask the public to pay attention.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wang, who lives next door, has always been a vegetarian and recited Buddhist scriptures, piously cultivating for the afterlife, hoping for good results in the next life. She also longs to be immortal in this life, so she seeks various ways. Recently, she heard people say: "This year is a leap year, and it is in June, which is really rare. Making a shroud and coffin on Peng Zu Day can make you as long-lived as Peng Zu, who lived to be 800 years old." She believed this, and she also heard her grandfather say it. So Mrs. Wang thought she wanted to live as long as the Southern Mountains. On the twelfth day of the leap June that so-called auspicious day of Peng Zu's birthday she summoned several experts in making shrouds and coffins from superior Phoebe nanmu to start construction. So for the past few days, the sound of cutting wood has been constantly coming from the Wang residence. Only yesterday did it all finish. I really don't understand why this old lady who wants to "live as long as Peng Zu" would prepare a coffin.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Post-Performance Notes on the Shanghai Opera "The Pavilion of Wind and Waves" <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Shen</p>
<p>The drama "The Pavilion of Wind and Waves" gave me a very good impression, so I felt a special interest in watching the Shanghai opera version.</p>
<p>The story depicts Yue Fei's devotion to serving his country. From the opening to the closing, the audience's inspiration was "always dominated by the word "justice". Who loves the country, who sells their soul, everyone can see clearly, understand clearly.</p>
<p>Gu Yuezhen's performance as Yinping Niang was the most successful. Her aura was comparable to that of Tang Ruoqing. Every word she said, every step she took, was so heroic. She truly deserved to be called a female hero.</p>
<p>Jie Hongyuan's Yue Fei emphasized both singing and acting. When he appeared, his loyalty overflowed from his words and expressions, and my heart was shaken. In the end, when I saw the three heavy sentences, I shed tears.</p>
<p>Zhang Gusheng played Zhou Sanwei, the righteous presiding judge of Dali Temple. He abided by the law and was honest in his official duties. Because Yue Fei had contributed to the country and was innocent, he was unwilling to sentence him and resigned. This scene was also very wonderful.</p>
<p>Others, such as Jin Gengquan's Qin Gui, Yu Lintong's Niu Gao, Zhu Binsheng's Yue Yun, Kong Jiabin's Zhang Bao, and Xiao Gusheng's Zhang Xian, were all able to perform their duties.</p>
<p>One thing is worth noting: the Shanghai opera "The Pavilion of Wind and Waves" seems to have put a lot of effort into the scenery, lighting, props, and makeup, surpassing the drama version.</p>
<p>The lyrics of the play were written by Hu Zhifei, the screenplay by Ge Ge and Chen Mingxun, and the director was Xia Tian.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of a new path for Shanghai opera. What we used to see was either "trusting for life" or "winning the top prize in the imperial examination". Now, it is trending towards the infusion of ideas of "loving the country" and "loving the people", which is naturally a promising progress.</p>
<p>It is said that after "The Pavilion of Wind and Waves", the Empress Theater will also perform historical dramas such as "Ge Nunniang" and "Diaochan"!</p>
<p>Brief News: The China Experimental Drama Troupe was founded by students from major middle schools in this city who love drama. A meeting of cadres was held a few days ago. It was decided that the first production will be "Rebirth", directed by Xu Feng, and the troupe's address will be at 167 Aivenyi Road. They are currently rehearsing day and night and will perform at the Russian Art Theatre on the 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Record of the Golden Star Graduation Ceremony <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Han Quan</p>
<p>The efforts of the Golden Star Film Company in the isolated island, which has risen for more than a year, have contributed to the social efforts that we cannot underestimate! The authorities deeply felt the lack of new talents, so they spared no effort to establish the Golden Star Training Class. After six months of training, professors such as Yao Ke, Huang Zuolin, Jin Yunzhi, Zhou Yibai, Yan Gongshang, Wu Renzhi, Mrs. Peterson, etc. were invited to provide careful guidance, leaving no one behind, from more than 80 students and eliminating to 52, the strictness is conceivable!</p>
<p>The 17th was the date for the training class to hold its graduation ceremony, and a practice performance was held at the Lafayette Theater. The first program was the "Pantomime" directed by Jin Yunzhi, which gathered twenty or thirty students, each taking on a role to identify each person's strengths in acting. Among them, Ge Xiangting's old man and Jin Gang's director were the best! The second was Huang Zuolin's "Photography Studio Practice", which publicly exhibited the working conditions of the photography studio; Ding ~ Ming's performance of a fragment of "Sunrise" playing Xiao Dongxi was not bad, and the "eating biscuits" shot was good! The third play was Wu Renzhi's "Wang San", directed by Wu Renzhi. The "executioner" Ding Li and the "Wang San's wife" Cheng Lingzhi's acting skills were excellent and impeccable! The "finale" was Yao Ke's "Whale Oil", which had more plot, and the leading actors also worked harder. Qiu Ping, who played "Captain Annie", was "mentally deranged" when she appeared. Her pronunciation and actions of shouting were very realistic, and she could show the hidden pain in her heart even when she was laughing hysterically; but the kissing scene was very stiff! "Acting is afraid of being embarrassed", and there are various concerns, which is the biggest shortcoming of our film industry! According to Yao, when rehearsing, they still had to be forced, but they didn't leave more than two and a half feet apart! Jiang Sheng and He Chenbo were also not bad, and Geng Yulin, who played the shipowner, was a little stiff in his movements, but his facial expressions were acceptable.</p>
<p>After the performance, certificates were given. Overall, the students all achieved excellent results. Qiu Ping, Ding Li, Cheng Lingzhi, and Ding Ciming are promising talents, and we hope they will continue to work hard and have high expectations.</p>

<p>(3) Huang Guiqiu's Apprenticeship Causes a Storm (Part 2)</p>
<p>Now Zhang Xiaoshan's old story is brought up again, which undoubtedly provokes Yaoqing's anger, so Zhang Xiaoshan ran into a brick wall. Zhang Xiaoshan and Huang Guiqiu were old friends when they were roaming performers, and they had a considerable friendship with each other. Although he hit a nail, he still tried his best to make this happen. So he thought of Cheng Yuqing, the popular person in Gu Mao Xuan. Yuqing and Guiqiu did not know each other originally. Under the mediation of Zhang Xiaoshan, Yuqing met Guiqiu. Guiqiu knew that Yaoqing listened to this disciple, so he had to show great courtesy in front of Yuqing. Yuqing was originally a flattering person, and after being flattered by Guiqiu in this way, he strongly recommended him to his master. Yaoqing originally absolutely did not want to accept Guiqiu, but because he was embarrassed by Yuqing's feelings, he agreed to consider it. It is true that there is no coincidence without a book. In the few days when Yaoqing was considering this matter, a little misunderstanding occurred between Yuqing and Yaoqing, master and apprentice. Yuqing seemed to be very uncomfortable in his heart. Coincidentally, on the 30th of last month, Guiqiu invited Yuqing and Xiaoshan to drink outside the city again. Yuqing felt a little embarrassed to Guiqiu because there was still no definite news after many days. He drank a few more cups that day. After drinking, he went straight to the Huomashen Temple (Yaoqing's residence) drunk. He walked into the Wang Mansion, saw his teacher, and opened his mouth to ask: "Has that matter been agreed to or not?" The so-called "that matter" refers to Huang Guiqiu's apprenticeship. As for why the master and apprentice clashed as soon as they met, I have already explained it earlier, because there was another misunderstanding between the master and apprentice. As for the origin of the misunderstanding, it was the long-term cause of the master and apprentice turning against each other. To know this, we must talk about Cheng Yuqing.</p>

<p>— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrations by Zhang Xiwei</p>
<p>(32) Yu Zhenfei</p>
<p>Yu Zhenfei transitioned from an amateur to a professional performer. When he was an amateur, he specialized in Kunqu opera. Zhenfei's father, Mr. Sulu, was a respected elder in the Kunqu amateur scene at the time. Whether insiders or outsiders, everyone regarded him as a standard and looked up to him as a beacon. Zhenfei's understanding of Kunqu came from his family and was profound. Coupled with his exceptional appearance and elegant demeanor, his portrayal of young scholars and junior officials was unmatched. When Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu came south, Zhenfei would occasionally guest-star in Kunqu operas alongside them. Each time he appeared on stage, public opinion unanimously praised him. Mei and Cheng admired his talent and strongly encouraged him to become a professional performer. Zhenfei was moved by their encouragement and went north to study under the Xiaosheng (young male role) master Cheng Jixian, thus officially becoming a professional performer and joining Cheng Yanqiu's troupe. Zhenfei's dedication to Peking opera is still relatively new, so it would be presumptuous to say that he has reached an extraordinary level. However, his solid foundation in Kunqu opera allows him to integrate it into Peking opera. His elegance and grace are undoubtedly outstanding. He is also skilled at understanding the emotions in plays, and Cheng Yanqiu's new plays have benefited greatly from his assistance. Two years ago, he and Cheng Yanqiu separated due to disagreements. Cheng Yanqiu's loss of this excellent assistant inevitably diminished her performances, and Zhenfei also felt that collaborating with other actors was not as suitable. It can be described as a "double loss."</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Yuanyuan's Petite Name, Jiao Qiluo</p>
<p>The playboy Guan Yan coldly said, "Does Miss Chen want to burn incense? I see that there are many great temples in Yanjing (Beijing), so you can go there to burn incense. There's no need to go to Qionglong Mountain." Yuanyuan was stunned by these words. She didn't ask him why, but smiled and said, "This is a vow I made, so it's important for me to go." Guan Yan smiled and said, "Indeed, Miss's wish is probably to marry a noble person and enjoy wealth and status for the rest of her life. To meet a noble person and make them happy is indeed not easy. Miss, your wish will be fulfilled sooner or later." Tian Hongyu also laughed heartily, stroking his beard. Yuanyuan couldn't bear Guan Yan's words. She cursed him inwardly, "You mischievous ghost, you only like to say such awkward things. Do you think you know how to please noble people? I'll see what you can do after I leave with the poet tomorrow night." So she said lightly, "Young Master Gao, you're not the蛔虫 (蛔虫, ascaris, is used as a metaphor for someone who knows one's innermost thoughts) in my stomach. How do you know my wishes? Do you think all women are greedy for wealth?" These words were also Yuanyuan's intentional counterattack, but she couldn't speak freely in front of Tian Hongyu. But Guan Yan still said shamelessly, "Although not entirely accurate, it's not far off. Miss Yuanyuan, I would love to be the 蛔虫 in your stomach, living in the heart of a beautiful woman. I'm just afraid you won't allow it." When Yuanyuan heard Guan Yan say this, her face flushed, and she turned her face away, not answering him. Tian Hongyu raised his wine glass and drank freely until dusk before leaving. Yuanyuan's foster mother saw him out, and Guan Yan whispered a few more words to her before leaving. This was unknown to Yuanyuan. Yuanyuan was annoyed by Tian Hongyu and Guan Yan's constant harassment today. She felt that Tian Hongyu was very interested in her, and Guan Yan was constantly encouraging him from the sidelines, which was very dangerous. Fortunately, she and the poet Xiyu had already made a tacit agreement to run away tomorrow night, so she could avoid Tian Hongyu's affections. Therefore, in the middle of the night, she secretly checked and packed the pearls, gold, silver, and valuable clothes hidden in her suitcase, putting them in one box, because there were too many to carry. It was after the fourth watch (around 2-4 am) before she went to bed. When she woke up, birds were singing everywhere, and the sunlight was on the window. She slowly got up, washed, and after having breakfast, she saw her foster mother coming upstairs. She sat opposite her, with an embarrassed look on her face, tears welling up in her eyes, and she was mumbling as if she had something to say to her. Yuanyuan saw her foster mother in this state, and her heart was filled with suspicion. She guessed that something unfavorable to her must have happened, and she couldn't help but furrow her brows and ask her foster mother what was going on. (End of Chapter 14)</p>
