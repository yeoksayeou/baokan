<p>合衆社二十日華盛頓電　美國官員昨對遠東進展保持密切之接觸、惟表示在日本新內閣之政策禾經公布以前、局勢如何、殊難逆料、國務院繼續其「等待」政策、外交方面則建議日本應取同樣態度、此言表示外交談判之時期即將開始、外交觀察家稱、日本領袖將儘力避免對美國造成軍事衝突、惟不信日本政府肯放棄其南進或北進之拓展計劃、多數專家對日本是否即將向西伯利亞有所行動、表示懷疑、官方稱、日本如有所行動、美國于必要時尚能對日本作額外之經濟及財政之限制、此種步驟將包括、（一）完全斷絕美國未提煉油類及其他仍舊對日出口之一切供給、（二）完全凍結日在美之資金、（三）美國將在拉丁美洲及菲列濱對與日人有關之商行、發出黑册、（四）美國能驅逐日本領事官員、此輩承認日本能對此種步驟加以報復、惟美國現時是吾將執行此種栽制、官方尚無表示云、</p>
<p>路透社二十日華盛頓電　此間官塲現仍以殷切熊度注視遠東局勢、日本政策之未有立即大變與美日談話之賡續、固已引起若干安慰、惟衆信未來動作、必視戰局發展爲轉移、若干國會議昌刻主張堅强立塲、參議員諾利斯對客聲稱、吾人不能對日綏靖、猶吾人不能對希特勒綏靖也、同時、參議員吉勒特視海軍部所發太平洋美商船折回本國口岸之命令、爲當局對於美、日諒解認爲無望之表徵、</p>
<p>合衆社二十日東京電　日本時代廣知報本日午刊評論稱、日本政策不能爲他國所轉移、又言、現內閣並不較前內閣爲更軍事化、並暗示東條上將或不放棄近衛所開始之對美談判、但或將使用他種探尋及計劃云、又權威方面證實、新政府將於一週內恢復對美談話、</p>

<p>合衆社二十日東京電　首相東條英機昨向伊勢神宮參拜就任新職後、已於下午乘機返東京、當即入新閣視事、赴伊勢神宮忽促之行、衆認爲頗堪注意、因新首相往常係於就職後兩週始從容前往參拜神宮也、</p>

<p>路透社二十日東京電　日外省機關報日本時報今日社論謂、以海參崴爲美國援蘇物品之經過路綫、含有使戰事延至東亞之危險、如美·日關係仍如目前之緊張、則美國對蘇援助達於菉點之外、定將使太平洋局勢惡化、如美國願對蘇聯予以有效而充分之援助、則太平洋關係之改善、乃美國所必要者、此種關係之調整、必須以正確了解東亞和平機構之日本政策爲根據、美國苟欲切實援蘇、而以援蘇物品穿太平洋而達海參崴、則當知友誼的日本之重要云、</p>
<p>路透社二十日倫敦電　據此間消息靈通人士之見解、遠東緊張時局、雖因東條被任日首相之結果又吿尖銳、惟不似有立即爆發之虞、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>人類合作與生產建設　—馬克斯，喬治與韋而斯之學說—</h3>
<p>世上賢哲能以社會福利爲前提，苦心孤詣以謀救時拯民之遠圖者，伯拉圖與亞力斯托多之理想民主政治以及馬合之烏托邦，殆皆爲西洋宗匠登峯之傑搆。國人之研討修身齊家治國平天下之道者多矣，而禮運篇所載「大道之行也，天下爲公……使老有所終，壯有所用，幼有所長，矜寡孤獨廢疾者皆有所養……貨惡其棄於地也，不必藏於己，力惡其不出於身也，不必爲己，是故謀閉而不興，盜竊亂賊而不作，故外戶而不閉，是爲大同」一節自爲先聖哲學思想之楷模。</p>
<p>顧前述之方針僅就政治觀點與空洞之環境中爲抽象之描繪，至於社會之現實與夫能吾將是類政策爲有效之實施，則多失之於無縝密之規畫。允以我人好高務遠，每涉玄虛之境，故其結果，如搦泳然，初非不盈把，漸搦漸消，至於無有。夫能洞燭癥結而爲和盤托出對症發藥者，則當推德之馬克司，美之喬治與英之韋而斯三人。馬氏「資本論」初版於一八六七年。喬著「進步與窮苦」問世於一八八〇年，最近五年來韋氏完成「人類之命運」與「新世界秩序」二卷。是三賢與其著作在我國容未能盡耳濡目染，在歐美諸國則不但爲經濟學者之師法珍鑑，凡爲學人，固無不能略道一二。</p>
<p>今爲三賢相提並論者，良有其時代進化之需要。我人握此機緣爲扼要之檢討，權當芻蕘之貢，而有望於友邦賢達之共同推進，是則豈僅三賢之得償夙願，要爲全人類之幸福也。</p>
<p>論三賢著書立說之動機與遭遇，皆有其不謀而合之因素。馬氏與喬治皆深受十九世紀末季工業革命澎湃之影響，並發現可怖矛盾之民生情况，而思挽回在瀾之法。韋而斯則激於二十世紀中季現代文明崩潰之象徵、乃向全世界爲補救之呼籲。考三賢之著述雖皆從當時社會基礎上提綱挈領而依據科學爲縱橫論列，但當初發行時，絕不受人歡迎，此爲彼等預料所及者，惟彼等深信將必譯成各國文字而傳之後世，固亦應騐於後。</p>
<p>以言三氏之立論要旨，馬克斯認爲當時德國之生產方式爲剝削勞動之價值、緣勞動者所生產之價值甚鉬，惟所獲得之報酬價值則極微，此其鉅大之價值差額，即所指爲過剩勞力價值者殆盡爲資方所攫奪。因此資本愈積愈厚，而勞力則愈勞愈薄，勢必促成無窮之爭執與衝突，此即馬氏所引爲惶懼而喚醒世人纠正之者也。</p>
<p>喬治鑒於新大陸土地投機之瘋在，造成畸形發展之局面，除土地投機得獲致原利外，勞動與利息之酬償，日趨低落，長此以往、生產要素之正當運用、勢必停頓，因此將必激成反動與崩潰。爲挽此危局，喬治力主實行單稅制，專徵土地稅以矯正投機之風，而不徵勞力之生產以爲扶植之道。此二氏觀察之環境不同，但所得悲觀之結論與纠正之方式，則初無二致。顧彼等所引爲悲觀之總崩潰未即爆發者，則有賴於國外開拓之設施，殖民地之剝削，以彌補勞力之低酬而得轉危爲安，此則二氏並未預爲計及也。</p>
<p>韋而斯則指人類之進化已超過我人之預算。今日交通之便利，已使國界狹小至於不能維持完整主權之國策，是以堅持全世界人類急應化除畛域，劃一人權保障與工作，俾盡人能享受文明之收穫。</p>
<p>綜上以言，韋氏之立論，實爲補充馬氏與喬治之發現。惟韋氏所未明言者，蓋今日世界非但日見其狹小，且已無餘地可供某一民族之單獨利用與剝削。同時，經濟機構之缺陷雖多，但生產之進步足以供應全人類之需要，是以目前之政治經濟環境與十九世紀逈不相同，故韋氏之人類合作主張，實爲解決人類亘古以來之懸案唯一捷徑。數年前國聯亦宣布類似之主張，足徵各國殊途同歸之捷徑將必有實現之一日，而我人之期望於全人類者，厥維和衷共濟，與一視同仁，以求文明之邁進而已。</p>
<h3>歐戰業叢談　俄羅斯之戰的驚心動魂</h3>
<p>突擊隊重行進攻，居然直抵堡壘，將其四面圍繞，但見穴中黑暗捲起，槍砲無聲。德軍逐漸進通，直達堡壘後門。忽而門啓之處，機關槍手溜彈又如雨點一般射來。轉瞬之間，門又砰然閉上，不見白旂樹起。於是德軍不得不留駐部隊，以攻破寗死不降的堡壘。他們由一座鋼門進至另一座鋼門。紅軍退守梯級，迨至手溜彈把梯炸斷，他們又轉至底下一層。外面的德軍步兵，雖已一湧而過，可是堡內「巷戰，」在進行之中。</p>
<p>蘇俄守軍雖知大勢巳去，無可挽回，但他們還有最後的一着。突然間天搖地動，遠遠聽得下面一聲雷響，從炸毀的門口中衝出一陣黃烟，頓時全堡如死，紅軍巳把他們的火藥庫炸毀了。</p>
<p>德軍現在所遭遇的，却是這樣的戰鬥精神與勇氣。</p>
<p>德國兵士並不愚笨，亦非頑鈍不靈，毫無感覺，有如機械一般。因爲他是一個靑年，因爲他習於閃電戰精密的動作，像這樣的戰况，不免使他發生一個很深的印像。這種戰况，並不使他削弱軍人的勇氣，但在百十種不同的戰區，他無往而不遭遇新式的敵人和新式的戰術，使他磨練成爲一個更可怖的新式戰士。德國兵士有智力，有勇氣，飽受訓練，因而富有自動力。然其品性的關鍵却在他對於戰爭一事的態度—他是一個軍人，不是一個動員的平民。希特勒的軍隊，大都只知各種形式的戰鬥。他們的生活，就是一個長期的鬥爭，從童年起始，經過政治奮鬥時代的巷戰，以迄於今日，衝鋒陷陣的大戰。</p>
<p>在他們中間，有許多簡直以回復平常生活爲不可想像的事。記者會見過不少德國靑年軍人，其地位不同，出身不同，莫不沉迷於戰時的軍隊生活，一且和平恢復，簡直將不知所爲了。可是在對俄作戰以前，他們並沒有經歷過艱苦的戰役，要幾星期或幾個月的伏處戰壕，而爲之疾首痛心，他們祇有一路長驅，勢如破竹，直達歐洲大陸最遠的一隅。他們是活動的兵士，是轟雷掣電式的攻擊兵士，能在短期戰爭內發揮其全部的精神體力。簡而言之，他們乃是利於閃電戰的兵士呀。</p>
<p>可是在蘇俄的戰爭，却並不是閃電戰，德國兵士的改變，這就是一個原因吧！他們的本質和耐久力第一次受到試騐。他們的勇氣也是第一决受到試騐的機會。他們在地圖上看到俄難斯幅員遼闊，更是第一次覺得他們的目標不知遠在幾千里之外呢。</p>
<p>他們在沒有路徑的沼澤森林中作戰，也在極目所至，但見一片焦土的平原上作戰。</p>
<p>一個德國兵會吿我以他們的隊伍在有機會沐浴時的一段情形。他們奉命防守一個航空站，沿邊有一道闊而且深的河流。當他們赤裸裸的互相呼喚，紛紛躍入淸潔凉爽的河水中時，早巳把他們營中的衣服槍械和身體的疲勞，忘諸九霄雲外了。不料紅軍戰車突然自樹林中出理，便用槍砲搽射。轟炸機亦在空中怒吼，機關槍彈有如雨點般的降落。他們不獨是赤手空拳，而且是赤身露體，祇好蜷伏河濱，束手待斃。有好多人被彈擊中，倒在水裹，也有的跑回營房，倉皇披衣，執槍應戰。</p>
<p>正當激戰之際，德軍砲隊和戰軍巳趕來接應。德國的戰鬥機也飛到攻擊蘇聯的轟炸機，並有援軍自空中開到。容克斯運兵飛機裝載槍砲兵士，在塲降落，終於把機塲守住。這一批突然出現的紅軍，原是遭德軍包圍而隱藏在深林中的，最後亦被擊退。可是河水的陰凉，洗澡的快樂，這種夢想，亦已隨之而消滅了。</p>
<p>像這樣的事，眞是不可勝數，在廣大無比的東戰塲上，天天都有得報吿。僅就芬蘭方面行軍情形而論，已可警成一書，在那裏的戰車，汽車，和運輸車，都變成廢物，士兵們祇有披荊斬棘而進，所經沼澤，水深無底，軍行至此，幾於無時無刻不在慄慄危懼之中。夜間狼嗥虎嘯，更使人驚心動魄，魂夢不安。</p>
<p>關於水的問題，亦可著一長文。蘇俄飲水缺乏，在烈日如焚之下，跋涉長途，兵士們皆口渴欲死，因此軍中不聞歌聲。軍行所至，又沒有女子，其實并非沒有女子，不過羅宋婦女，多帶有槍械，與男子一般，難以近身罷了。</p>
<p>一個目光銳敏的瑞士觀察家，會留心觀察德國陸軍的成長和作戰，對於德國兵士曾有下列的論斷：</p>
<p>「這班靑年，像希臘神話中的普魯米蘇一樣，會襲擊衆神所居的城堡。然而普魯米蘇的最後命運，不是很悲慘的麼？他曾推倒世界的主人麼？他不是被鎖在深淵上面的岩石上永遠懺悔他的大胆行爲麼？」</p>
<p>這祇有時間能答覆這個問題了。然而俄羅斯之戰，正在使德國兵士改變，巳是無可吾認的。他們今日，面對一個與他們同屬革命產物的敵人，方始第一次明瞭身爲戰士的全部意義。（完）</p>

<p>金雙馬期貨猛然上升、廠單開出首先即吿漲停板、期紗十月期爲最後一日、開盤一八九〇元、十一月一九九七元、升一百元、即漲停板、十二月開盤二〇四五元、亦停板、十月份入後高至一九一八元爲午收價、下午追證後、繼續開做、十月期最後軋空、叉漲二十餘元、爲一九四五元收市、軋好八十九元、十一二月期因浮多獲利出籠、稍見回小、各升九十元左右、觀其上升之烈、本報早巳料及、乃日前市價之軟、實因國際形勢人心恐慌所致、故一見和緩、即吿猛騰、惟目下趨勢雖尙有其他不測之謠諑所打擊、第以一般觀察、無論局勢如何、乃根本上之本棉日缺與外棉來路如何、在成本上自宜有所注意云、茲列表於後、</p>
<h3>黑滙停止供給　甚囂塵上</h3>
<p>外匯咋日市况、中央與匯豐兩掛牌勿更、匯豐小檯櫃價穩定逾恒、英美匯黑黑市投機奸商、又放出種種對於平準會之放棄維持本市黑匯傳說、引起各方不知底蘊之恐怖心理、供售者忽叉絕跡、於晨開後即聞美匯三元七五有不准申請之進口商扒給、賣方始終無價還出、隱伏混亂狀况、美金票飛漲至卅三元、允使美匯竟還緊僅三元一二五、時扒者見價太貴意懈、午刻稍見回鬆、下午變動較小、終日未聞成交、照晚收價，約英匯二辦士一二五、美匯三元二五、比上週六午收、英緊一二五、美緊六二五、</p>
<p>咋日外幣市况、英美金鎊隨現金價飛漲十五元、英金票亦猛漲六元、美金票會高至三十三元、午後忽而退至三十元、卒爲三十元〇五角、比上週軋升二元三角牛、香港票需要亦殷、市價挺漲三角、日金票漲風大熾、晚市高至二元八角一分、朝鮮票亦跟漲至二元一角三分、</p>
<h3>棉價過高　成交反少</h3>
<p>現棉情况、隨流言而續騰、但成交頗少、已入呆漲狀態中、昨蘭宮印棉尙有做開、價格較上週復增十數元、持貨者多抱無限之信念、致市價雖昂而件量反形减色、</p>
<p>蘭宮　一〇〇件　五三〇·〇　號家進</p>

<h3>米市一片求買聲　幸有公債米批出稍挫稅氣</h3>
<p>昨洋米漲風益厲、蓋自被國際風雲影饗抬高後、人心多爲向上、昨日又有外滙停供之說、人心更爲興奮、業內外各囤無不急起吸收、市塲中一片求買聲、而浮多散戶更乘機活躍、皮球搶風允見興奮、市價竟拾級上升、小絞現米自一百四十元開價一直漲到一百四十五元、一號西貢至一百五十六七元、比之前市激昂五六七元不等、英華司小絞亦自一百六十七元漲到一百六十九元、飛黃騰達莫可遏止、繼聞工部局批出小絞、市乃頓瀉四五元、小紋又回至一百四十元、但午後再到一百四十四五元、繼在收市前證實公賣小絞確有一千五百噸批出、價始略平、收一百四十三元、仍比上週六漲四五元、成交不下三四萬包、又千外噸、</p>
<p>厚薄新破兩粳國米市、到貨雖稱不弱、新破兩粳共到四百餘石、但以洋米一再飛漲、人心並昂、貨主均持貨扳售、不過本鄉店胃尙不敢多辦、結果兩粳行情、雖提不足、僅增二三元、計開南港早破一百五十八九元、崑山新粳一百五十七八元靑角窰種及楓涇百哥並開一百五十九元、决至一百五十七元半、杜尖仍以乏貨無市，</p>
<p>糯米因來源久斷、市貨將罄、作客迨有向隅之虞、致市色最俏、在貨主居奇、繼續猛提之下、香港高白元竟開至一百七十二元、次貨亦須一百六十八九元、糯菉一百六十一元、决至一百五十九元、比週前又飛漲八九元之巨、</p>
<h3>內債尚少振作</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、咋市仍覺虛軟、川幫雖無現貨流出、而多方現貨壅塞、加以銀根又緊、市塲一般心理、以爲買公債、等於法幣存銀行、其意大概利小而穩、較之其他各種投機大起大落者、不可以道里計、目下因環境不利、不能抬頭耳、咋上午前有新華怡泰久豐及同康買進、市價一度略見高面、但後以中孚昌記鑫豐信孚震康紛紛賣出、或多頭出籠、或現貨流出、而買方完全爲補空、午收仍在上週六收盤價以下、午後新華怡泰九成聯和補進、但震康仍有賣出、鴻大潤傯順秦均有出脫、市况漸趨疲落、丙種做過八元四角小價、前途尙少樂觀、市價結果、除乙種未有高低外、其他四種小一角半至三角、成交總數、共計一百八九十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交三友實業社股一百股、價爲每股廿九元正、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、晨初多方拉抬、開價幾與上週之高峯接近、開後終因回漲過劇、引起獲利者傾吐、空戶復乘機壓迫、價乃步步下趨、又幾以一日中之最低價收盤、</p>
<h3>食糖漲風大熾</h3>
<p>昨糖市因傳停止供給上海外滙之說甚盛、故漲風大熾、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白十月份入口由二百十九元升二百三十五元、九月份二百十七元升至三十四元、八月份二百十六元升至三十三元、七月份二百十二元升至三十二元、均升二十四五元、香港貨亦由一百九十七元直升至二百十八元、收盤爲二百十六元、升二十七元、荷赤一百八十五元、中途回至八十一元、上午收盤仍爲八十五元、下午復緊爲一百八十八元至一百九十六元、升十九元太古車白二百十五元至二百三十元、升二十二元、HX嘜二百零三元至五元、下午十五元至十八元、升二十一元、H嘜亦一百八十元、</p>
<h3>棉布直上</h3>
<p>廠布　咋市趨勢激昂、乃因外傳平準會有停供外滙之說、故囤風復熾、售盤上漲猛烈、白貨粗細布斜紋漲一元至二元、漂染布絨布開價參差、漲一元左右、本街成交一千餘件、囤戶買進最佔多數、二十一日有疋頭十二件運厦門、</p>
<h3>投機氣氛　瀰漫雜糧市場</h3>
<p>雜糧市塲、昨因投機氣氛漫瀰、業內外蠢商相互競吸甚力、致行情一致被拉抬高漲、結果食油猛升達十元之巨、黃豆漲二元左右、苞米昂三五元、統市售開靑島生油五十桶、又豆油三十桶、大連豆油一百五十桶、江北豆油五十桶、又生油二百聽、膠州生油二十件、大有廠淸油五百擔、各廠菜油三千擔、天津金元二百餘包、</p>

<p>全市商民　善自檢點</p>
<p>復决、公衆方面、幸勿希望即有多種物品、行將置於控制之下、良以本局之決定、爲所可實施之管理方法、常屬本局認爲爲公衆利益着想所可收效之管理方法、至於主要物品售價之管理、當逐步推行、同時、當與關係方面作充分之洽商、本局並無于涉進口·批發·與零售·商人所得合法利益之意、但有鄭重聲明者一點、卽本局所擬請求之權力、倘能獲得、則物價之管理、可以實施、而對於若干案件之處理、無虞偏頗、最後爲公衆告者、卽用戶自謀保障之道、在乎勿多囤物品、以備私用、藉免助長投機與漁利之風氣也、</p>
<p>局擬辦法　即可核准</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、公共相界工部局於今（二十日）晨九時三十分、在局厦內舉行局會、歷三十五分鐘、決議草擬附則、交上海領事團核准、俾統制界內之零售物價與非法暴利、聞該會於上星期六午刻、已會召間局會、擬定之新附則可望於今日午後遞交領事團、而於數日內核准、今晨工部局某員解釋新附則不須納稅人之核准、蓋納稅人上决年會中、已通過決讓案、授工部局以採此步驟之全權也、就今晨所能知者、工部局所將採行統制零售物價與非法暴利之辦法、與法租界所取者相似、而與法公董局全力合作進行、蓋險非兩租界合作、仟何辦法均難充分奏效也、</p>
<p>煤球價格　已在協議</p>
<p>關於法公董局上週所取統制辦法、該局總董譚鴣啼未能績發任何一言論、惟表示渠正候公共租界當局採取步驟、然後雙方可望更密切合作、以應付現局、聞兩租界當局業已開始統制煤球價之討論、數日內可望商獲決定、同時、上海普通麵包價今日又漲四角、常納華克酒紅籤每瓶漲至一百廿五元、黑籤漲至一百七十五元、且每决祗能購一瓶、法公董局評價委員會昨日下午三時並舉行重要會議、由維納主席、米業·柴炭煤號業·華洋雜貨業。醬油號業。鮮肉業·等、均派代表參加、公董局及捕房均派幹員蒞會、除由各業報吿市况外、對於物價問題、亦有討論、</p>

<p>米價日漲、民食維艱、咋日一日間、各米號至立基洋行申請添購工部局洋米之數量、增至一萬餘包、均經該洋行之負責人予以核准、惟立基洋行爲防免囤積起見、對過去向在米行批購工部局洋米之米號家、如該米行之工部局洋米何未售罄前、則此等米號家、無權向立基洋行繼續批購工部局洋米、必須待該米行所存之工部局洋米悉數售罄後、始准添購、</p>

<p>去年的冬天，我和他閒談的時候，他曾計劃想出版一種叢書，他說書必須有實質，開卷有益，掩卷有味，雖然世事擾攘，人心不安，好書必有人看。正因在這大時代中，書籍更爲人們需要。在今年夏初，他吿訴我天下叢書已在陸續付印，預定計劃，在今年年底將出滿十册。而現在果眞巳出版了七八種。這於他和他的幾位譯書朋友是一種豐富的收穫，對於讀者是獲得了精美的糧食。我佩服他的苦幹硬幹的毅力</p>
<p>「西洋雜誌文觀止」共四卷，約六十萬字，業已出齊。書名「西洋雜誌文觀止」，眞個是名副其實。原來本書是美國著名「文摘雜誌」Beader＇s　Digest出版十八年來的文選集。「讀者文摘」爲人人愛讀的雜誌，期銷四百餘萬册。所以人人愛讀者，第一乃其內容所涉的範圍至廣，天文地理，風俗人情，歷史掌故，科學自然，山水人物，無所不有，包羅萬象；第二，其所選文章，文字通俗而雋永，簡短而扼要，老幼可讀，男女咸宜。一期Reader’s　Digest　的內容巳琳琅滿目，美不勝收，現在從二百十六期，五六千篇佳作中選出這部集子，則其精采絕頂，自更無待辭費了。至於這部全譯本，譯筆的淸楚簡潔，可說是本書的錦上添花。</p>
<p>「在德軍後方」一書是美國芝加哥講壇戰的國外通訊昌當他駐德工作時的生活實錄。是他離開了德國才寫的。對於戰時德國的一切情形，上自軍政大計，下至民間生活，無不暢言無忌。全書約二十萬字，讀之殊勝於暢遊德國後方一决。</p>
<p>「在倫敦前綫」作者是一個久居倫敦者，所以更合於描寫倫敦的驚人經過，這書從各種角度，描寫出倫敦平民心目中所認爲是戰時的生活情形。他並不作任何斷語，也不作任何最後的判決。他的企圖不過要讓人們得到一個戰事正這個階段中的印象，不過要　人看見居住在這個小島上　的人民，於以往十五個月中，在這次大戰中所過的怎樣的一幅生活形態。全書凡三十章，洋洋二十萬言。戰時倫敦，躍然紙上。</p>
<p>「天下文章」，共收精美短文二十一篇，談做人，談節制生育，談家庭，談贍養費，談女子，談戰爭，談文人，以及暴露社會罪惡等等，趣味橫溢</p>
<p>「天下新書」是這部叢書的總稱，每册書上並鐫有「唯有讀書高」這句神童詩的篆刻印章，典雅有致，不愧好書。</p>

<h3>徵文揭曉之五　偷雞不着蝕了米　—我得了一個敎訓—</h3>
<p>— 定閑</p>
<p>物價與薪水，活像兔子與烏龜的賽跑，可是，在半路上打嗑　的，倒不是那頭能跳會蹦的兔子，意外地還是輸到這隻死不爭氣的烏龜哪！</p>
<p>妻的面色一天枯黃一天；孩子們哭着嚷着要這要那；而老年母親那經常吃不到油水的枯腸，竟出奇的會餓，差不多成了一種病象。這都難怪，生活的營養，在我們是太缺乏了。</p>
<p>在這種情形下，我那裏再能漠視下去，我得想辦法補救，但，節流早巳節到了「流」的盡頭，唯一的方法，只有去開源了。</p>
<p>然而這麼一個渺小而又沒有「脚路」的人，還有什麼正當的方法來開源，病急亂投翳，終於我盲目地選擇了那條始終不願意走而又常常想走的路——投機。</p>
<p>我把妻的僅有的手飾兌了作資本，昧心地做起市儈們的幫兇來。居然皇天不負苦心人，第一個月裏，成績很美滿。我開始在泰然的心情下甚至是熱望的心情下看着各色各樣市價在漲。雖然賺是賺不足的，每一次的買賣我都在剛漲的時候就急於脫手了，却也掙了不少的錢，家裹人都有了活氣，生計的解決想不到竟這樣容易啊！</p>
<p>但是，風浪來了。好景過得不久，市塲裏驀地起了一個猛烈的跌風，眼光一齊變了「看小，不利的謠言從各處傳來，說明着種種關於「看小」的理由，好像這一個跌風將永無止境。我的「多頭心思」被動搖了，連忙在一個小小的虧耗之下，忍痛斬割了再去「翻空，」然而命運之神徧徧跟我開頑笑，行市忽又反動劇漲，我吃了一記市塲術語裏的所謂「兩面耳光」，千日捉柴一日燒，一個月來的心血充掉還不够。、</p>
<p>偷雞不着蝕了米，我決不能就此罷手，我還得想法子幹。不過，從那時起，巳經失了經營的主宰，多頭空頭，無論向那一方面做，結果總是適得其反。我的資本愈做愈短，我的心思愈來愈寒，而我的方針竟愈弄愈亂了。</p>
<p>幸而不久，否極秦來了，從一個友人的關切裏，得了個秘密消息，我千方百計借了債，用繳證余的方法向紗號裏做進十包期紗，那朋友的消息並不假，市面在我買進後不多幾天，突然在跳了。我興奮得幾乎想哭，我疑惑像是在做夢，我的心止不住　跟着市面在跳了，一種苦盡甘來的况味强烈地襲來。我想，這一下，我是得救了。</p>
<p>可是當我打算賣出而撥動那紗號的電話號碼時，情形和平常有些兩樣，對方的鈴　震得怪響，却沒人來接，我接二連三搖過去，結果都是一樣。我不禁惶惑起來，急急地趕到那紗號門口，老遠望見大門開着，心裏一喜，泰然地跨進門，一眼向那一間紗號的寫字間裹望去，却冷了半截，想不到果眞闃也無人，房門上了鎖，代替他的是一張律師淸理的佈吿，那上面寫着密集的小字，我待要看個明白，而我的眼睛早已花了，只看見那一朶一朶的墨跡，化開來化開來，變成了許多吃人的野獸，張牙舞齒向我撲來……我想發怒，却失掉了勇氣：我想哭，却沒有了眼淚；半響，我止不住咬着嘴脣皮對牠苦笑起來，我想：我非但拿不到那盈餘，反而倒掉了本錢，這是世界上最大的欺騙，可是那個叫我自己投上來的？……我總算得了一個敎訓了！</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>波蘭的神鷹</h3>
<p>— 林濤</p>
<p>爲了他們作戰的勇敢，在英國皇家空軍服役的波蘭飛行員將成爲此决大戰的傳奇英雄。他們是兇狠的戰國者，因爲他們的生命已由遭遇夫去了一切感情，只有對希特勒鐵烏的仇恨與渴望報復。他們已失去了他們的家鄉國。死對他們是不重要的惟死時，他們能對他們悲劇的罪魁施一打擊。</p>
<p>英國空軍部情報處宜佈，波蘭人的戰績，對他們的姓名總嚴守秘密，因爲他們大多數有親戚，朋友住在德國領域內。自去年八月至今，官方只破了一决例。那是Sergeant　Pilot　Josef　Franciszek，他的姓名在他死後就宜佈了。他榮耀的飛行紀念章，是因爲他在一日半的苦鬭中，擊落五架德機而得到的。</p>
<p>起初，波蘭人的熱烈，使英國指揮官頭痛。在地面上波蘭人是服從的。但是在空中，只要有敵可擊，他們便不肯列成隊伍。如用無綫電去指揮他們，所可得到的回答只是「不耍煩，英國人」。</p>
<p>大多數的波蘭航空員是分散在空軍服務隊中，但其中有一戰鬭中隊，一轟炸中隊，完全是波蘭人組成的。Kosciusko　中隊是一個舊的戰鬭單位改編。在希特勒的閃電戰前，波蘭有個Kosciusko　中隊。牠老式的飛機，不充足的軍備，當然敵不過希特勒優越的空軍。飛行隊人員很勇敢的戰鬭後，便逃亡，經過巴爾幹，至法蘭西。在那裹，會聚了別的波蘭飛行員，並得到一些設備，再至空中成爲一個作戰單位。當法國屈服，他們逃亡入英國。一九四〇年八月一日，被編入英國空軍隊。規定須在一個月訓練之後，使他們熟悉了機槍的運用與飛機的</p>
<p>駕馭後，方可升空作戰。但是這些年輕人等不及了。在八月三十日，規定該隊可參戰的前一日，Franciszek　便擊落了五架德機。</p>
<p>轟炸隊最後一步的訓練，是叫他們帶足了汽油與炸彈升入空中，好像去作遠程的轟炸一樣。許多飛機雜亂的上升。他們應該在短時內返回。但是幾小時過去，不見回音，指揮官着急了。最後這些轟炸機盤旋而下。</p>
<p>「你們上那兒去了？」指揮官責問。</p>
<p>「轟炸柏林，」這些波蘭人簡捷的回答。</p>
<p>在一九四〇年九月，戰事最激烈的一月，單是Kosciusko一中隊便擊落一百十八架德機。英皇喬治慰訪該隊的一天，正是波蘭人慶祝擊落十三架德機的一日——是那日皇家空軍繫落德機總數的三分之一。</p>
<p>波蘭人是蠻勇的飛將軍。但是他們也是精良的飛行員。</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>毒藥箱</h3>
<p>— 克忠</p>
<p>普通家庭中，爲備不時之需起見往往有藥櫉之設備，此種藥櫉，最易引起兒童之好奇心。倘將普通藥品與有毒藥品共置一處，則危險殊甚，性命攸關。美國傢具設計家有鑒於此，特在藥櫉中加造小鋼箱，置有堅固之鎖，專置毒藥，以防小兒之誤服，亦家庭設備中之一種新進步。國內主婦，亦可效其法而行之也。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十四　打英雄的生活</p>
<p>當秋海棠握緊着兩張十塊錢的鈔票，窘得像犯了什麼罪一樣的溜出合大典當時候，至少有兩串熱淚是給他硬生生地和着一股酸氣嚥下肚子去的。</p>
<p>他到上海後的第二天，便接連在國聯銀行的鄒行長那裏和巨籟達路張公館的張三爺那裏碰了兩個軟釘子，前者簡直不見，後者雖然勉强見了，但他一瞧見秋海棠那一副尊容，和他身上所穿的破爛不堪的衣服，臉色便立刻變得像幾個月不曾吃過熟米煮的飯一樣。秋海棠固然還是從前的秋海棠，但當初的那個把秋海棠捧上三十三天去的張三爺，却彷彿巳經死了。</p>
<p>第三天，他幾乎沒有勇氣再去找尋那餘下的幾個熟人，但父女倆總不能等着餓死，因此他終於硬起頭皮，找到了一個姓侯的戲迷的家裹去。</p>
<p>這位侯老先生是一個潮州人，家裏開着幾個當舖，即使算不上巨當，至少三四十萬的家產是有的；因爲生活優游，便在「心廣體肥」的公律下，變成了一個重約一百九十多磅的大胖子。可是他歡喜聽戲，允其愛聽小嗓子的戲，後來終於不顧了許多至親好友的苦諫，自己也學起靑衣戲來。（二四一）</p>

<h3>「蛻變」中的丁大夫</h3>
<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>從卡爾登戲院看了曹禺的「蛻變」以後，我拈取了這樣一個題目。因爲我被劇中的這一人物感動了，深深地感動了！那些「被淘汰的腐爛階層」引起了我們的憎惡；他們也映襯得丁大夫，梁專員等更爲偉大。</p>
<p>第二慕的開始，丁大夫和她的獨子丁昌的談話，我認爲是一段「寫慈母柔腸」的極好的文章，值得初中國文讀本節選進去，作爲敎材。丁大夫聽說她兒子把錢遺失了，就再給他錢，兩邊口袋裹都親自替他放一些；見他把絨襯衫送了別人，就把自己的給了她那做小兵的兒子。後來空襲警報來了，傷兵醫院裹的人差不多都逃光了，丁大夫爲了一個傷兵正在生死關頭，還是一心一意地替傷兵開刀。像道樣犧牲自己的精神眞值得我們佩服，尊敬。我彷彿看見她的身　漸大了起來。</p>
<p>第三幕寫丁大夫理知與情感的衝突，「明知兒子傷愈之後仍應獻身祖國，但是自私的母愛似乎在阻止她這意念。結果理知戰勝了一切，還是自己動手使兒子晚離險境，決心消除了自私的母愛。」這也是使我感動的。</p>
<p>「背上了十字架」的作者木圭女士直到第三幕開始纔趕了來看戲，我想向她說：「你來遲了！可惜你不會看到剝橋子時大瓣的和解小瓣連在一起的有趣的情形。」這用的是她跋裹的話，她是拿這來比譬母子之愛的。</p>
<p>丹尼女士精湛的演出增加了劇本的光采。她演得自然入化，使我忘記了她是在演戲，眞的以爲她是傷兵們，不，該說是中國偉大的母親。</p>
<h3>不是笑話</h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>戲劇家蕭伯納有一决在慈善舞會上跟一個女子婆娑起舞，忽而聽到她這樣說：「像你是一位名聞全球的學者，爲什麼要跟一個窮得可憐的女干跳舞呢？」今天舉行的是慈善舞會呀！」蕭伯納毫不遲疑的回答了她。</p>
<p>大音樂家派德拉期基，一决在維多利亞女皇御前演奏完畢後，皇上報之以熱烈的歡迎，並且還稱他是一位有天才的人。「現在我的確可以說有天才的人了。」派德拉斯基說時的態度是很猶豫的。「我的皇上！但是在我的天才未發現前，我那時祗能稱一個苦工呢！」</p>

<p>據我所知道，在備有收音機的家庭中，大多數都愛聽平劇唱片節目，主要的當然是因爲平劇本身在游藝中比較通俗的緣故。平劇唱片都是名伶的精心傑作，而且有許多名伶，如譚鑫培孫菊仙陳德霖等，已經是過去的人了，我們雖然不能冉見他們于紅氍毺上，可是還能够從唱片中聆取「絕唱」呢！</p>
<p>電台上所播的唱片，有許多很名貴，不過大都是零零碎碎的，全部的祗有梅蘭芳楊小樓的「覇王別姬，「馬連良王玉蓉的「武家坡；」管紹華王玉蓉的「四郎探母」等寥寥幾部，所以聽起來不够痛快，甚至還會聽厭。過去也有過幾家電台，集合各名伶的唱片，順决播唱，譬如「洪羊洞」一劇集合了余叔岩馬連良譚富英王少樓金少山等的唱片，如此一氣呵成的「名伶大會串，」自然精采續紛，在聽衆也覺得興趣濃厚而淋漓盡致了。</p>
<p>民主電台每日上午十時至十一時就有一擋「全部平劇」唱片的節目，星期日則在九時至十時，他們的唱片可以說很完備，過去播唱的有洪羊洞。烏盆計·宇宙鋒·玉堂春·捉放曹·失空斬·搜孤救孤·駡曹·賣馬·瓊林宴·等等，誠愛聆全部平劇聽衆的福音也。</p>

<h3>With Eager Attention from America, Awaiting the Development of the Far Eastern Situation; Japan Plans to Resume Talks with the US Within a Week; Britain Prepares to Fulfill its Promise to Fully Assist the US</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 20th - American officials yesterday maintained close contact with developments in the Far East, but stated that it is difficult to predict how the situation will unfold before the policies of the new Japanese cabinet are announced. The State Department continues its "wait-and-see" policy, and diplomatically suggests that Japan should adopt the same attitude. This indicates that a period of diplomatic negotiations is about to begin. Diplomatic observers say that Japanese leaders will do their best to avoid military conflict with the United States, but do not believe that the Japanese government will abandon its expansion plans to the south or north. Most experts express doubts as to whether Japan will take action against Siberia soon. Officials say that if Japan takes action, the United States can still impose additional economic and financial restrictions on Japan if necessary. These steps will include: (1) completely cutting off the supply of unrefined oil and other goods still exported to Japan from the United States; (2) completely freezing Japanese funds in the United States; (3) the United States will issue a blacklist in Latin America and the Philippines against businesses related to Japanese people; (4) the United States can expel Japanese consular officials. These officials acknowledge that Japan can retaliate against these measures, but the United States has not yet indicated whether it will implement these sanctions.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th - Official circles here are still watching the situation in the Far East with eager attention. The lack of immediate major changes in Japanese policy and the continuation of US-Japan talks have indeed brought some comfort, but it is widely believed that future actions will depend on the development of the war situation. Some members of Congress are now advocating a firm stance. Senator Norris publicly stated, "We cannot appease Japan, just as we cannot appease Hitler." At the same time, Senator Gillette viewed the Navy Department's order for American merchant ships in the Pacific to return to domestic ports as a sign that the authorities consider a US-Japan understanding to be hopeless.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 20th - The Japanese Jiji Shimpo published a commentary in its midday edition today stating that Japanese policy cannot be swayed by other countries. It also said that the current cabinet is not more militarized than the previous cabinet, and hinted that General Tojo may not abandon the US-Japan talks initiated by Konoe, but may use other explorations and plans. Authoritative sources have confirmed that the new government will resume talks with the United States within a week.</p>
<p>London, 19th - The emergence of the new Tojo cabinet in Japan has not shaken the firm attitude of the British side in the slightest. Well-informed sources here believe that the Tojo cabinet is an extremely pro-Axis and pro-aggression cabinet. Japan's decision to appoint an army officer as prime minister is enough to show that the navy has retreated to a non-essential position (it is generally believed that the Japanese navy is more stable than the army). Therefore, the British side should be closely vigilant. An official warned Japan: (1) the definite limit of compromise has already been exceeded; (2) Britain will never sit idly by while Japan seizes the entire Pacific; (3) Churchill said that once a war breaks out in the Pacific, Britain will fully cooperate with the United States in the war. The British side is now fully prepared to fulfill this promise. (4) If Japan attacks Vladivostok, Britain will consider it equivalent to attacking Deauville in the UK. British public opinion is also unanimously supporting the above-mentioned stance, and advocating a clear warning to Japan stating that if it attacks Siberia or implements southward expansion, then the US, Britain, China, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union will take joint action. Only in this way can Japan heed our warning, and the common interests and security of all countries can be preserved.</p>
<p>Tojo Calls for Unity, Japanese Cabinet to Meet Tomorrow</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo today issued a departmental order to the personnel of the Ministry of the Army, calling on the military and civilians to unite strongly to respond to the "foreign encirclement suffered by Japan." He said that the nation is now at a crossroads of life and death, and encouraged the personnel of the Ministry of the Army to prepare to sacrifice everything to overcome the current crisis. Tojo also said that he was deeply moved to be ordered to form a cabinet at this time, while also holding the leadership of the army. The progress of Japan's military build-up program in the past year is very satisfactory.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 20th - Prime Minister Tojo Hideki visited the Ise Grand Shrine yesterday after assuming his new position, and returned to Tokyo by plane in the afternoon to take office in the new cabinet. The hasty trip to the Ise Grand Shrine is considered to be quite noteworthy, because the new prime minister usually visits the shrine leisurely two weeks after taking office.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - The first action of the new Prime Minister Tojo after taking office as Minister of Home Affairs was the complete replacement of all major positions in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. It is generally believed that Tojo may have plans to thoroughly reform bureaucratic politics before implementing his new programs.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - According to well-informed observers here, if the US-Japan talks in Washington ultimately prove ineffective, then Japan will inevitably advance southward. It is estimated that Tojo will give the US-Japan talks a final stimulus before the talks break down. Although the new cabinet members seem to be moderate on the surface, the main cabinet members do have continental ambitions, which cannot be ignored. The handover procedures between the new and old prime ministers have not yet been officially completed, because former Prime Minister Konoe is currently ill. It is expected that the first regular meeting of the new cabinet will be held on October 22. Araki Sadao, a member of the Supreme Military Administration Council, published an article calling on the people to abandon the idea of relying on aid from other countries, saying that the Japanese people should rise up and overcome the current difficulties themselves. The right-wing military political party Toowa-kai also published an article asking the new government to quickly implement Japan's national policy.</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 20th - The Yomiuri Shimbun said today that General Tojo Hideki concurrently serving as Prime Minister, Army Minister, and Minister of Home Affairs is unprecedented in Japanese history. The new government has resolved to implement Japan's unchanging policy, which is to successfully resolve the "China Incident" and establish the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The newspaper believes that this transmits "various possible peaceful measures," and also said, "If the United States abandons the US-British-Chinese-Dutch encirclement of Japan and cooperates with Japan, then the peace in the Pacific that the United States is eagerly talking about can be surely maintained."</p>
<p>Japanese Navy Minister Declares Preparedness to Cope with Contingencies</p>
<p>United Press, Tokyo, 20th - The new Navy Minister, Admiral Shimada Shigetaro, delivered a radio address to the nation yesterday, saying that the Japanese Navy is prepared to cope with any changes in the world situation. Shimada said that if the Navy and Army maintain close cooperation, and the people are willing to endure all difficulties, then Japan will surely achieve the strongest position.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 20th - The Japan Times, the organ of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in an editorial today that the route through Vladivostok for US aid to the Soviet Union contains the danger of extending the war to East Asia. If US-Japan relations remain as tense as they are now, then US aid to the Soviet Union beyond the point will definitely worsen the situation in the Pacific. If the United States is willing to provide effective and full assistance to the Soviet Union, then the improvement of Pacific relations is necessary for the United States. This adjustment of relations must be based on a correct understanding of Japan's policy for the East Asian peace mechanism. If the United States wants to effectively aid the Soviet Union and send aid goods through the Pacific to Vladivostok, then it should know the importance of a friendly Japan.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - According to the views of well-informed people here, the tense situation in the Far East, although sharpened again as a result of Tojo's appointment as Japanese Prime Minister, does not seem to be in immediate danger of breaking out.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Plans to Expand Lend-Lease Aid to the Soviet Union; British Workers Demand the Opening of a New Battlefield</h3>
<p>United Press, Hyde Park, 20th - President Roosevelt received the first report yesterday on the tripartite conference held in Moscow. Hopkins presented the President with a preliminary report drafted by US representative Harriman. Harriman is scheduled to go to the White House on Thursday to report to President Roosevelt in person. At the same time, according to unofficial speculation here, the President is planning to extend the Lend-Lease Act to aid the Soviet Union, in order to urgently transport supplies to the besieged Red Army.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 20th - Two thousand worker representatives met yesterday to discuss war production. The main points were: (1) war factories are full of suspicion, believing that the government is sitting idly by and letting the Soviet Union collapse; (2) demanding the opening of a second front. Conference Chairman Swanson said that the workers in every factory are deeply surprised that the government is not fully advancing with the Soviet Union, and it is necessary to publicly declare that the factories are full of suspicion that the government is sitting idly by and letting the Soviet Union collapse, and believe that the reason why the second front has not been established is that Halifax, Moore-Brabazon, Maunsergh and others hold important positions in the cabinet. He said, "We warn the government that the workers will never allow the Soviet Union to collapse, because if it does, we will collapse with it."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Economic Warfare Minister Dalton said yesterday in Durham County that within a week of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Allied ships were already carrying urgently needed supplies to the Soviet Union. From the first day of the German attack on the Soviet Union four months ago, the British government has been giving its full support to the Soviet Union with supplies. The Economic Warfare Department, together with the War Transport Department, has been working on non-military supplies. In the first three months of the Soviet-German war, the British side has supplied a huge amount of rubber, tin, aluminum, lead, hemp, steel, and wool, as well as millions of pairs of leather shoes. However, for the benefit of both Britain and the Soviet Union, the details of Britain's assistance to the Soviet Union are not convenient to announce, but the British government will always meet the needs of the Soviet Union to the greatest possible extent. This can be stated clearly.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - A general assembly of women was held in London yesterday, where the wife of the Soviet ambassador Maisky received gifts from the British side to the Red Army. 25,000 British labor and professional women signed a book guaranteeing all possible assistance to British-Soviet mutual aid. When accepting the gift, Mrs. Maisky said, "We have many difficulties, but we are absolutely convinced that although we are temporarily suffering setbacks, the final victory will surely belong to us."</p>
<p>Reuters, Melbourne, 20th - When the executive members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions met at the end of the week, they advocated that workers' organizations in Pacific coastal countries send representatives to hold a meeting to consider a common policy towards the Soviet Union, and for the same purpose, the Australian Federal Labor Advisory Committee should meet as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Cuba Asks Spain to Recall Intelligence Attaché</h3>
<p>Reuters, Havana, 20th - The Cuban Secretary of State has now asked the Spanish government to recall González, the intelligence attaché stationed in Havana, because the attaché's Fascist activities and propaganda are in conflict with Cuba's foreign policy and national interests.</p>
<h3>Iraq Notifies Japan of Severing Trade Relations</h3>
<p>United Press, Cairo, 20th - Reliable sources say that Iraq has decided to sever trade relations with Japan. These sources say that this decision has been formally notified to Japan, and Japanese trade groups have been asked to leave the country.</p>
<h3>US Armed Merchant Ship Case to Be Passed Quickly by the Senate; US Senators Advocate Immediate Retaliation for the Attack on the Destroyer Kearny</h3>
<p>United Press, Washington, 20th - Senator Connally, a Democratic Senator from Texas and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called for American sailors and fleets to engage in "shoot-on-sight" action early this morning before the committee meeting to retaliate for the "murder" of the US destroyer Kearny. Connally predicted that after the Navy Department announced the news that eleven people were missing and ten were injured, the Senate would quickly pass the pending bill on arming merchant ships. According to Connally, the committee he chaired was originally scheduled to discuss routine matters this morning, but the Kearny incident and the extremists' attempt to force the Senate to vote on a declaration of war turned this meeting into a special meeting. Connally declared that the Kearny attack must be retaliated. Our country's warships should sink all German submarines in the fortified sea. House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bloom said that the Kearny attack is enough to show that the Germans, whether on land or at sea, are doing senseless things regardless of life and property. Representative McCormack, a Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, said that the Kearny attack was obviously a threatening action by the German government in response to the change of cabinet in Japan, and intended to oppress the United States in both oceans.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 20th - The Navy Department announced today that the US destroyer Kearny, which was recently attacked by a submarine, has now arrived in a certain port, but the name of the port has not been announced. It is said that the ship was attacked by a submarine, undoubtedly German, early Friday morning. According to the report received from the ship, eleven crew members are missing and two are seriously injured. In addition, there are eight people with minor injuries, but none are in danger. The injured have been sent to the hospital, and the families of the missing have been notified.</p>
<h3>Workers at US Bell Plant Prepare to Strike</h3>
<p>Reuters, Buffalo, New York, 20th - The United Auto Workers here have voted to take strike action against the Bell Aircraft Manufacturing Plant in Buffalo and Niagara Falls, but will not strike temporarily while the Arbitration Board is still trying to mediate. If this labor unrest is realized, 10,500 workers manufacturing military aircraft will be affected. Bell Aircraft Company is contracted by Britain and the United States to build approximately $150 million worth of aircraft.</p>
<h3>New Zealand Prime Minister Declares Determination to Cooperate with the Six Powers to Maintain Civilization and Traditional Freedom; Singapore to Evacuate Coastal Residents</h3>
<p>Reuters, Wellington, 20th - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser spoke on the Pacific issue last night, saying, "We do not want war, but if a Pacific war still breaks out despite our best efforts to avoid it, then the government and people of New Zealand can only face this situation with faith and composure. The people of New Zealand will never let down their compatriots in England and compatriots overseas, nor will they betray our goals and traditional freedoms. New Zealand must be prepared to cooperate in various ways with Britain, Australia, the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States to maintain peace in the Pacific."</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 20th - Complete arrangements have now been made here to evacuate civilians from the east and west coast areas of Singapore once an emergency occurs. This plan can be implemented immediately. The authorities have issued instructions separately, requiring those who are able to arrange their own accommodation during the evacuation, and those who are unable to register and enter government shelters. The authorities also issued a warning to follow the road designated by the authorities during the evacuation and not to panic, because everyone has sufficient time to seek refuge in a safe place.</p>
<p>Reuters, Singapore, 20th - The Singapore Free Press quoted Air Vice-Marshal Pulford, commander of the British Air Force in the Far East, as saying that since the British Air Force has completely controlled the skies in the Middle East, it will also be able to deal with the Japanese army in the Far East in the same way. The Japanese Air Force should not be underestimated, but today's British Air Force in the Far East has excellent aircraft and pilots, and is excellent in both personnel and equipment, which is not only sufficient to defend Malaya, but also sufficient to carry out various necessary offensive actions to gain an advantage in controlling the skies. He is very satisfied with this.</p>
<p>Reuters, Melbourne, 20th - When Australia solicited public bonds yesterday, 97 merchants purchased a total of £200,000 by phone and telegraph within two hours.</p>

<h3>German Troops Reach the Outskirts of Moscow, Red Army Prepares for a Head-on Blow, German Army in Donets River Basin Suffers Heavy Losses, Soviet Counterattack in Orel Causes Many Enemy Casualties</h3>
<p>United Press, London, 20th - Moscow and its surrounding areas have been placed under martial law. The Soviet people are vowing to defend Moscow to the "last drop of blood." Every street and house is being fortified with strong defenses, ready to meet the German troops advancing eastward, who have already reached sixty miles from the city. Moscow Radio quoted Pravda's commentary on the martial law decree, saying that Hitler has driven his main forces to attack Moscow, southwest of Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets. The commentary stated, "The enemy's attacks have not ceased to this day, and our heroic warriors have already blunted their edge. However, the enemy continues to send reinforcements repeatedly, as Hitler's desire to seize Moscow is increasingly urgent. This martial law order will mobilize the entire population to defend Moscow. We have built strong defenses in and around Moscow, prepared for a fierce battle, and have decided to use all possible means, even street fighting, to resist the enemy. Every anti-aircraft gunner, every tank crew member, every aviator will each guard their post. The people also welcome these plans and recognize their importance. From now on, any spies and special envoys of the fascists will be shown no mercy and will be wiped out. The National Defense Committee has instructed the people to obey orders, remain calm, and give the Red Army their full assistance. We have vowed to fight for the Soviet capital and are determined to defend Moscow to the last drop of blood. Long live Moscow! Long live our country!"</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - A Moscow spokesperson broadcasted last night that fierce battles continue in the Kalinin region, one hundred miles northwest of Moscow, where Soviet troops under Kamenko are launching counterattacks. Every inch of land and every rafter of a house is being contested. Soviet forces have established an impregnable line of defense in the Kalinin area to resist German tanks. It is expected that even more intense blood battles will occur. Another Soviet broadcast stated that the German army's attacks on the Soviet forces in the Donets River basin have not succeeded and have instead suffered heavy losses. Yesterday, Moscow Radio also reported that the Soviet army's counterattack in the Orel region, one hundred miles southwest of Moscow, was successful. On Saturday and Sunday, the German army in the Orel region attacked several sections of the front line in an attempt to advance, but the Soviet army there repelled the German attacks with small special forces and counterattacked several times, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. On Sunday morning, a German team attempted to force a river crossing in small boats, but was met with a heavy blow from the Soviet army. Many of the small boats capsized or sank, and the rest retreated in disarray.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Yesterday's German communiqué boasted that the Soviet army under General Timoshenko had been annihilated again. However, a Reuters military correspondent said that the German army does not seem to have approached Moscow any closer. The recent Soviet communiqué stated that there were fierce battles in some areas, and the Soviet army had repelled the German army's fierce attacks. The battle for Moscow has been going on for three weeks now. The Germans claimed that their southern army had advanced along the Sea of Azov and occupied the city of Taganrog. If this is true, then the general expectation that the German army in the south will resume its offensive near the mouth of the Don River has been confirmed.</p>
<p>National Defense Committee Chairman Stalin Decides to Stay in the Soviet Capital to Personally Supervise the Battle</p>
<p>United Press, Moscow, 20th - The vanguard of the German army has penetrated the outer defenses of Moscow and launched a new offensive against Moscow. At the same time, Stalin declared in his order of the day that Moscow will resist to the end, and the Red Army will defend Moscow to the end under Stalin's personal command. Moscow is clearly going to be transformed from a beautiful city into a battlefield. The 4.5 million people in the city will be mixed with tens of millions of fighting German and Soviet soldiers. The order of the day was broadcast on Moscow Radio last night, hours after the official announcement that the German army had penetrated an area of Moscow's outer circle. The radio broadcast stated that Stalin, in his capacity as Chairman of the National Defense Committee, signed the order and indicated that after diplomatic envoys and some government personnel moved to the new capital in the east, he would supervise the battle from the rear. Stalin said that the people of Moscow are extremely calm and will do their best to assist the Red Army in resisting and defending Moscow.</p>
<p>United Press, London, 20th - German armored divisions attacked the largest defensive line surrounding Moscow yesterday, putting the Soviet capital in the most dangerous situation of the war. But Stalin has now personally taken command and says Moscow will not be abandoned. Moscow Radio broadcast that a large number of Red Army troops are going to the outskirts of Moscow to fight, and thousands of Soviet people are also assisting the Red Army in the fighting. The German army also said that new troops have been sent as reinforcements.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, 20th - It was reported here yesterday that the Soviet authorities are preparing to defend Moscow to the death. A worker's army battalion was sent to the front line on Saturday. The team was hastily formed on October 1st, all of whom are workers who have never received military training, and most of them are over the age of military service. There are now two defensive circles in Moscow, the inner circle is for close combat with the enemy. The scene in Moscow has completely changed.</p>
<p>Soviet Far East Army Transferred to Central Front to Assist Frontline Soldiers</p>
<p>International News Service, London, 20th - According to information heard here, Moscow Radio reported that powerful Red Army reinforcements, transferred from Siberia and Mongolia, are now arriving in the European part of the Soviet Union to assist Soviet troops on the central front. It is estimated that the Soviet army's support troops still have 130 divisions, 2,250,000 people, ready to join the front line. Last night, Soviet official news agency TASS reported that Soviet troops are now building strong new defenses along the roads leading to Moscow. At the same time, every street and house in Moscow is being rushed to build defenses to prevent the German army from rushing into the city.</p>
<p>Severe Cold in Southern Soviet Union Greatly Hinders German Progress</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Berlin Radio broadcast last night, admitting that there is also a severe cold in the southern Soviet front, which greatly hinders the German and allied forces. It is said that the fighting is taking place on frozen slippery roads. Despite these obstacles and the particularly strong resistance of the Soviet army, the German army has broken through the Soviet army's strong positions in several places and captured 7,000 Soviet soldiers. On Friday and Saturday, the Soviet army counterattacked several times but was repelled. Soviet troops in the Leningrad area in the north repeatedly launched attacks but were also driven back.</p>
<p>British and American Tanks Arrive on the Soviet Front Line Fascist Army's Fierce Attacks Repelled</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Both the Soviet and German sides claim to have won important victories in the Battle of Moscow. The Soviet Army's Red Star reported that the Soviet army had won a victory in the Kalinin region, saying that the Soviet 2nd Division in the region had repelled three German armies. The German official news agency said that the German army had broken through the Moscow line in several places, and the Soviet army's subsequent counterattacks had been repelled. Reports from both sides indicate that the battle for Moscow is still fierce. Moscow news said that fresh troops are now being transferred from all over the Soviet Union, and tanks and aircraft supplied by Britain and the United States have now arrived at the front. According to the Soviet midnight communiqué, fighting continued on all fronts on October 19. The fighting was particularly fierce in the Mozhaisk and Maloyaroslavets areas. The fierce attacks of the German fascist army have been repelled. On October 18, 38 German planes were destroyed, and 17 Soviet planes were also lost.</p>
<p>Newly Equipped Million-Strong Indian Army Prepares to Cross the Border to Protect Soviet Oil Fields</p>
<p>United Press, West Simla, 20th - Neutral military observers declared yesterday that once the Indian Army is equipped, its strength will be sufficient to take action against any first-class military power. One million soldiers have been divided into mechanized, motorized, and infantry units. Once the German army's advance in the Sea of Azov threatens the large oil fields in the east and the British supply routes to the Soviet Union, this batch of soldiers can be sent to the Caucasus to join forces with the Soviet army.</p>

<h3>Chinese Army in Zhengzhou Area Successfully Attacks Shifo, Japanese Counterattack Across from Yichang Fails, Three Japanese Planes Destroyed at Bailuoji</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Military News: (1) The Japanese, who invaded southward from Cenhekou and other places southeast of Jiangling on the morning of the 17th, once invaded Huagang. After the Chinese army bravely counterattacked, it recaptured the area on the 18th. The Japanese, unable to support it, were defeated and fled north. The Chinese are now pursuing them. (2) A part of the Japanese across from Yichang launched a counterattack at dawn on the 13th from Moji Mountain and Fanjiakou toward Luojiadahui and Highland 2543, which had been occupied by the Chinese army. After fierce fighting with the Chinese army for a long time, the area was lost and regained. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties and were defeated and retreated. (3) A certain unit of the Chinese army attacked the Japanese and the Japanese airfield at Bailuoji several times in the first ten days of this month, causing heavy losses to the Japanese. On the 12th, the Chinese artillery bombed the Japanese airfield at Bailuoji again, destroying three Japanese planes. At the moment, no Japanese planes are stationed at the airfield. (4) A unit of the Chinese army in the Zhengzhou area attacked the Japanese in Shifo (northwest of Zhengzhou) on the morning of the 17th, killing and wounding many Japanese soldiers. (5) The Japanese in the Zhongmu area who were repelled at Zhangzhuang Street are still being pursued by the Chinese army. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A Chinese military spokesman declared today that there has been very little fighting on the various fronts between China and Japan in the past week, except for small-scale clashes near Zhengzhou, Suiyuan West, and Shashi. Japanese transport ships have been quite active along the Yangtze River, mostly carrying supplies to various places upstream and then returning empty. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Course of the Yichang Battle</p>
<p>Badong - Wu Qiwai, Deputy Commander of the Sixth War Area, told the United Press yesterday that the Battle of Yichang was very important for disrupting the Japanese army's offensive into Hunan. The battle revealed a lot about the Japanese army's defensive works and troop strength in the area. The Chinese army also learned that the lack of artillery and aircraft was a major obstacle, and that their training and equipment were insufficient to engage in chemical warfare. Wu explained to reporters that the Japanese army in the area hid in the mountains. When the Chinese army came to attack, they retreated into the mountains to hold on. Therefore, the Chinese army did not use the strategy that had been used successfully in the Nanning area for the first time, that is, not to attack the Japanese army's outposts or fortresses, but to attack their supply lines. As a result, the Japanese army either abandoned an area to assist the area under attack, or completely evacuated the area due to supply difficulties and constant casualties. I discussed the Battle of Yichang with the highest commander of artillery in the area and learned that the Japanese artillery positions were very difficult to destroy. These artillery positions were steel and concrete bunkers with heavy iron doors that opened when the artillery was fired, and used wire to pull hand grenades to prevent infantry from climbing the mountains to attack. If there were aircraft, it would be very easy to scout and bomb these artillery positions. It was also very difficult for the Chinese army to transport artillery. The Japanese had traffic artillery, and the Chinese army only had narrow and inclined paths in the mountains for traffic, so the artillery had to be dismantled and carried by soldiers themselves. The range of the artillery was also reduced because it was not possible to observe distant targets in these mountains. However, despite these difficulties, the Chinese army was able to occupy three Japanese fortresses on the south bank of the Yangtze River, but was later forced to withdraw. The artillery division finally said that it would be easy to recapture Yichang if there were aircraft, but it would be very difficult to wage modern warfare without aircraft.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Human Cooperation and Productive Construction - The Doctrines of Marx, George, and Wells -</h3>
<p>Those sages and philosophers in the world who take social welfare as the premise and painstakingly seek far-reaching plans to save the times and rescue the people include Plato and Aristotle's ideal democratic politics and More's Utopia, which are almost all masterpieces of Western masters. There are many Chinese people who study the ways of cultivating oneself, regulating the family, governing the country, and pacifying the world. The section in the Book of Rites that says, "When the Grand Course was pursued, a public and common spirit ruled all under the sky… so that the old found occupation to their last days, the strong had employment, the young were properly trained, and all widows and orphans, the disabled and the sick, were well cared for… They disliked that goods should be thrown away upon the ground, but did not necessarily keep them for their own use. They hated that their strength should not be exerted, but did not necessarily apply it to their own benefit. Thus (selfish) schemings were repressed and found no development, and robbers, filchers, and rebellious traitors did not show themselves, and hence the outer doors remained unclosed, and this was (the period of) what we call the Grand Union," is a model of philosophical thought from the ancient sages.</p>
<p>However, the aforementioned guidelines only provide abstract descriptions from a political point of view and in an empty environment. As for the reality of society and the ability to effectively implement such policies, they often lack meticulous planning. It is true that we Chinese people like to aim high and pursue distant goals, and often enter a state of metaphysics. Therefore, the result is like trying to grab water, which is not too little at first, but gradually disappears as it is grabbed, until there is nothing left. Those who can thoroughly understand the crux of the problem, present it clearly, and prescribe the right medicine should be Marx of Germany, George of the United States, and Wells of England. Marx's "Das Kapital" was first published in 1867. George's "Progress and Poverty" was published in 1880. In the past five years, Wells has completed two volumes, "The Fate of Man" and "The New World Order." These three sages and their works may not be fully known to the ears and eyes of our country, but in European and American countries, they are not only the masters and precious guides for economists, but all scholars cannot fail to mention a thing or two.</p>
<p>Now, the reason for mentioning these three sages together is that there is a need for the evolution of the times. We seize this opportunity for a summary review, taking it as a contribution, and hoping for the joint promotion of wise men from friendly countries. Then it is not only that the three sages will have their wishes fulfilled, but it is also for the happiness of all mankind.</p>
<p>Speaking of the motives and experiences of the three sages in writing books and establishing theories, they all have factors that coincide. Marx and George were both deeply influenced by the surging industrial revolution in the late 19th century, and discovered the terrible contradiction in people's livelihood, and thought about ways to save the situation. Wells, on the other hand, was inspired by the symbolism of the collapse of modern civilization in the mid-20th century, and made a call to the world for remedies. The writings of the three sages were all based on the social foundation of the time, and they presented their arguments based on science, but when they were first published, they were never welcomed. This was within their expectations, but they firmly believed that they would be translated into various languages and passed down to future generations, which should also be verified later.</p>
<p>Speaking of the main points of the three men's arguments, Marx believed that the German mode of production at that time was to exploit the value of labor. The value produced by workers was very high, but the value of the compensation they received was very low. The huge difference in value was what he referred to as surplus labor value, which was almost entirely seized by the capitalists. Therefore, capital became thicker and thicker, while labor became thinner and thinner, which would inevitably lead to endless disputes and conflicts. This is what Marx was afraid of and called on the world to correct.</p>
<p>George saw that the land speculation frenzy in the New World had created a distorted development situation. Apart from land speculation, which could obtain the original profit, the compensation for labor and interest was declining day by day. If this continued, the proper use of production factors would inevitably stagnate, and thus it would inevitably lead to reaction and collapse. In order to save this crisis, George advocated the implementation of a single tax system, specifically levying land tax to correct the trend of speculation, and not levying the production of labor as a way to support it. These two men observed different environments, but the pessimistic conclusions and corrective methods they reached were the same. However, the reason why the total collapse they cited as pessimism did not immediately erupt was that it relied on the facilities of foreign expansion and the exploitation of colonies to make up for the low compensation of labor and turn the crisis into safety. This was something that the two men did not take into account in advance.</p>
<p>Wells pointed out that the evolution of mankind has exceeded our expectations. Today, the convenience of transportation has made national borders so small that they cannot maintain the national policy of complete sovereignty. Therefore, he insists that all mankind in the world should urgently eliminate the boundaries, unify the protection of human rights and work, so that all people can enjoy the fruits of civilization.</p>
<p>In summary, Wells' argument is actually a supplement to the findings of Marx and George. However, what Wells did not explicitly state is that today's world is not only becoming smaller and smaller, but there is no more room for any one nation to use and exploit it alone. At the same time, although there are many defects in the economic structure, the progress of production is enough to supply the needs of all mankind. Therefore, the current political and economic environment is very different from that of the 19th century. Therefore, Wells' advocacy of human cooperation is the only shortcut to solve the long-standing problem of mankind. The League of Nations also announced similar proposals a few years ago, which shows that the shortcut for countries to reach the same goal by different routes will have a day of realization. What we expect from all mankind is to work together in harmony and treat everyone equally in order to advance civilization.</p>
<h3>European War Casual Talks: The Soul-Stirring Battle of Russia</h3>
<p>The assault troops launched a new attack, unexpectedly reaching the fortress directly, surrounding it on all sides. All that could be seen was darkness swirling within, with no sound of gunfire. The German troops gradually advanced, reaching the rear gate of the fortress. Suddenly, from where the gate opened, machine gun fire and grenades rained down like a storm. In an instant, the gate slammed shut again, with no white flag raised. Thus, the German troops had to station troops to break through the fortress that would rather die than surrender. They advanced from one steel door to another. The Red Army retreated to the staircases, and when the grenades blew up the stairs, they moved to the lower level. Although the German infantry outside had surged in, "street fighting" was underway within the fortress.</p>
<p>Although the Soviet Russian defenders knew that the overall situation was over and irretrievable, they still had one last move. Suddenly, the earth shook and the sky quaked, and a thunderous sound was heard from far below. A cloud of yellow smoke rushed out from the destroyed doorway. Instantly, the entire fortress was silent as death, as the Red Army had destroyed their powder magazine.</p>
<p>What the German army is encountering now is such fighting spirit and courage.</p>
<p>German soldiers are not foolish, nor are they dull and insensitive, like machines. Because he is a young man, because he is accustomed to the precise movements of blitzkrieg, such a battle situation cannot but leave a deep impression on him. This battle situation does not weaken the soldier's courage, but in hundreds of different battle zones, he invariably encounters new enemies and new tactics, which temper him into an even more terrifying new type of soldier. German soldiers have intelligence, courage, and are well-trained, and therefore have great initiative. But the key to their character lies in their attitude towards war—he is a soldier, not a mobilized civilian. Hitler's troops mostly only know various forms of combat. Their life is a long-term struggle, starting from childhood, through the street fighting of the political struggle era, to today's large-scale battles.</p>
<p>Among them, many simply consider returning to normal life as unimaginable. Reporters have met many young German soldiers of different statuses and backgrounds, all of whom are immersed in the wartime military life, and will simply not know what to do once peace is restored. But before the war against Russia, they had not experienced arduous battles, lying in trenches for weeks or months, and suffering for it. They only had long drives, unstoppable, reaching the farthest corners of the European continent. They are mobile soldiers, soldiers of lightning-fast attacks, who can exert all their mental and physical strength in short-term wars. In short, they are soldiers who are good at blitzkrieg.</p>
<p>But the war in Soviet Russia is not a blitzkrieg. The change in German soldiers is one reason for this! Their essence and endurance were tested for the first time. Their courage was also the first time to be tested. They saw the vastness of Russia on the map and felt for the first time that their goal was thousands of miles away.</p>
<p>They fought in pathless swamps and forests, and also fought on plains where all that could be seen was scorched earth.</p>
<p>A German soldier would tell me about a situation when their troops had the opportunity to bathe. They were ordered to defend an airfield, along which was a wide and deep river. When they were naked, calling to each other, and jumping into the clean and cool river, they had long forgotten about the clothes, guns, and physical fatigue in their camp. Unexpectedly, Red Army tanks suddenly appeared from the woods and sprayed them with gunfire. Bombers were also roaring in the air, and machine gun bullets fell like rain. They were not only empty-handed, but also naked, and had to huddle on the riverbank, waiting to die. Many were hit by bullets and fell into the water, and some ran back to the barracks, hurriedly putting on clothes and grabbing guns to fight.</p>
<p>Just as the fierce battle was underway, the German artillery and tanks had rushed to meet them. German fighter planes also flew to attack the Soviet bombers, and reinforcements arrived from the air. Junkers transport planes loaded with guns and soldiers landed on the field, finally holding the airfield. This group of suddenly appearing Red Army troops had been surrounded by the German army and hidden in the deep forest, and were finally repelled. But the coolness of the river and the joy of bathing, this dream, had also disappeared with it.</p>
<p>Such things are countless, and there are reports every day on the vast Eastern battlefield. Just the march on the Finnish side is enough to be a book. There, tanks, cars, and transport vehicles have become waste. The soldiers can only cut through thorns and brambles to advance. The swamps they pass through are bottomless. The military is almost constantly in fear and trepidation. At night, the howling of wolves and tigers is even more thrilling, making people uneasy in their dreams.</p>
<p>The problem of water can also be written into a long article. Soviet Russia lacks drinking water. Under the scorching sun, marching long distances, the soldiers are dying of thirst, so there is no singing in the army. Wherever the army goes, there are no women. In fact, it is not that there are no women, but that Russian women mostly carry guns, like men, and are difficult to approach.</p>
<p>A keen-eyed Swiss observer has carefully observed the growth and combat of the German army and has made the following judgment on German soldiers:</p>
<p>"This group of young people, like Prometheus in Greek mythology, will attack the castles inhabited by the gods. But wasn't Prometheus's final fate very tragic? Did he overthrow the masters of the world? Wasn't he chained to the rock above the abyss, eternally repenting of his bold behavior?"</p>
<p>Only time can answer this question. However, the war in Russia is changing German soldiers, which is undeniable. Today, facing an enemy who is also a product of revolution, they are only beginning to understand the full meaning of being a soldier. (End)</p>

<h3>Shanghai’s Foreign Exchange Needed for Proper Uses, the Government Still Supplies as Usual; British and American Financial and Economic Delegations, Their Opinions Are Consistent with Financial Authorities; Deputy Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun Makes a Statement to the Press</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Yu Hongjun, Deputy Minister of Finance, made a statement at a reception for journalists on the 20th, stating that after the arrival in Chongqing of the British Financial and Economic Delegation, Sir Niemeyer, Director of the Bank of England, Mr. Paxsted, Economic Advisor to the Government of Burma, and Mr. Cochran, expert from the U.S. Treasury Department, they have held multiple discussions with the Chinese financial authorities. On relevant issues, their opinions have been consistent with each other. Matters discussed by the members of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee in Hong Kong with the delegation's representatives have been approved by the Chinese government. The Chinese authorities firmly believe that the results of this meeting will lead to closer cooperation between the countries concerned in the economic warfare against Japan. The Chinese government's policy of supplying Shanghai with foreign exchange needed for proper uses has not changed. However, more effective measures will be implemented to prevent Japanese spies and speculators from profiting from it. Sir Niemeyer and Mr. Paxsted will stay in Chongqing for the time being, while Mr. Cochran will soon travel abroad for inspection. U.S. and British members of the Equalization Fund Committee, Messrs. Troxel and Hopper, will also participate in the talks and will return to their posts within this week. Gu Yiqun, Director of the Financial Department, will also travel to Hong Kong to discuss progress with the various committees of the Equalization Fund. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>After the Establishment of the Foreign Exchange Control Committee, Changes in Foreign Exchange Procedures in Hong Kong; Abolition of Application Procedures for Changes in Commercial Exchange Rates; The Bank of China Will Become the Purchasing Agent for Various Organizations</p>
<p>Hong Kong - After the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Control Committee chaired by Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, many changes in the foreign exchange situation here have been announced. The first is the cancellation of the commercial "black market" exchange rate. Previously, the Central Bank set two exchange rates daily, official and commercial. From October 1st, the Ministry of Finance ordered the cancellation of the bank's commercial exchange rate. After that, the Central Bank will only have one exchange rate for foreign exchange transactions, as determined by the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. Applications from various government agencies, merchants, and individuals, if approved by the government, can only obtain foreign exchange at the official exchange rate. The second change is in procedures. Previously, all applicants for foreign exchange submitted their applications to the Ministry of Finance, which were reviewed by a special committee established by the ministry. Since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Control Committee, all applications must be submitted to the first section of the committee responsible for this matter. However, it is heard that the Foreign Exchange Control Committee is focusing on reviewing applications from government agencies and the development of various enterprises, and has authorized the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee to review applications for foreign exchange from private individuals and businesses. The third change is related to purchasing goods from abroad. Previously, after applicants obtained foreign exchange from the Central Bank, they could purchase goods abroad themselves. This will no longer be the case in the future. After government agencies obtain foreign exchange from the Central Bank, they must submit their purchase orders to the Central Bank. Therefore, the Central Bank will become the sole purchasing agent for various government agencies. It is heard that this method can eliminate competitive purchasing, and by combining purchases through the Central Bank, lower prices can be obtained. In addition, the possibility of some agencies using foreign exchange to purchase items not approved by the government can also be eliminated. To handle this matter, a special purchasing division has been established in the Central Trust Bureau. It is heard that a commission of 10% will be charged, with the Central Trust Bureau retaining 1% and the remaining 9% being transferred to the relevant agencies. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<h3>Causing Panic and Unrest: Yellow Tiger and White Tiger</h3>
<p>The resurgence of the black market "Yellow Tiger" has created an astonishing new wave, with rapid and unpredictable price fluctuations. After an unprecedented surge, it suddenly eased slightly, leaving people in a state of extreme confusion. Rumors regarding the foreign exchange situation in this city have been circulating. The black market exchange rate tightened sharply, and a certain cash firm spared no expense to raise prices, resulting in an unprecedented high price of 13,000 yuan, breaking the previous record high of 11,400 yuan on the 14th of this month. The increase of 1,730 yuan compared to the afternoon closing price of last Saturday also broke the record of the largest increase of 1,140 yuan on that day. The rise was inevitably excessive, and when the foreign exchange market stabilized slightly, a selling wave was triggered. Large amounts were dumped by the Hong Kong and Chaozhou gangs. Xiangxing, Yong, Dafeng, Mingfeng, Shihe, and Xianghe actively sold, retreating 780 yuan, and the price dropped to 12,220-30 yuan. Ultimately, the price rose by 1,030 yuan. Trading was very active throughout the day, with a total of 3,500-3,600 taels traded on one side. As a result, the October gold futures, which had already disappeared, were no longer inquired about. Only 80 taels were traded at the opening and afternoon prices that day. The price of jewelry also reached a new high of 1,330 yuan, before falling back to 1,260 yuan, a rise of 110 yuan. The one-week cash delivery, which was originally scheduled to start today, may be delayed until Thursday due to the need for improvements to the regulations.</p>
<p>Cash Rises Sharply by More Than a Thousand</p>
<p>Cash prices rose sharply again, rising sharply in the morning due to rumors about foreign exchange. Shihe first entered Yongcheng with 10 taels, and the opening price was surprisingly 12,400 yuan, 1,130 yuan higher than last Saturday. Later, with few sellers, Shihe again aggressively raised the price by 600 yuan before entering Fukangyong and Yongcheng with 10 taels each, and Decheng with 30 taels, reaching an unprecedented high price of 13,000 yuan. Xinfengyong, Shunyuan, Xiangxingyong, Dafeng, Yongcheng, Yifeng, and Mingfeng competed to sell, and the price gradually fell. Seeing Shihe reappear, the decline was even faster, falling by 700 yuan to 12,300 yuan. Chengji, Tianyuan, Xianghe, and Decheng absorbed, raising the price again to 12,400 yuan. Defu, Mingfeng, Xiangxingyong, Tianyuan, and Shihe actively sold, pressing the price down to 12,240 yuan. Shunyuan, Decheng, Hesheng, and a certain bank absorbed, aggressively raising the price to 12,550 yuan. Chida, Chengji, and Dafeng dumped, gradually decreasing by 320 yuan. Tianyuan exited Chengji with 10 taels, retreating to 12,230 yuan. Defu re-entered, and the afternoon closed at 12,250 yuan. In the afternoon, Xiangxingyong exited Decheng with 20 taels, at 12,220 yuan. Mingfeng, Decheng, and Hesheng actively entered, rising by 230 yuan. Defu entered Xiangxingyong with 10 taels, rising to 12,450 yuan. Shihe, Xianghe, and Xiangxingyong dumped huge amounts, gradually retreating to 12,250 yuan, before Decheng aggressively retreated, slightly raising the price to 12,330 yuan. The evening closed at 12,300 yuan, a sharp increase of 1,030 yuan compared to last Saturday afternoon. A total of 3,500 taels were traded that day, with a difference of 780 yuan. The listed price of gold at gold shops was 12,500 yuan, with the purchase price being about 300-400 yuan lower than the selling price.</p>
<p>Futures Only 90 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The October futures opened sharply at 9:30 AM, also amidst the chaos, opening 220 yuan higher at 8,500 yuan. Later, as cash prices rose and then slightly eased, Tianyuan and Qingtaiyong sold off, and the price also fell back down. The afternoon closed at 8,350 yuan. There were no trades after opening at the same price in the afternoon, and the closing price at 4:00 PM was 8,370 yuan. Trading was sparse, and the price was 90 yuan higher than last Saturday afternoon, with an upward fluctuation of 150 yuan.</p>
<p>Jewelry Rises by 110 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry per tael at Dahangtong and Xinhangtong was surprisingly set at an unprecedented high of 1,330 yuan at 9:30 AM in the morning, before gradually decreasing, and was listed at 1,260 yuan. At noon, it was 1,280 yuan. At 2:45 PM in the afternoon, it dropped again by 20 yuan to 1,260 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by 50-60 yuan, a huge increase of 110 yuan.</p>
<p>Double Horse Opens at Limit Up</p>
<p>The White Tiger's yarn market is firm and the price surge came suddenly. This is because the gold market is jumping and there are many rumors about positive news, saying that the situation between Japan and the United States is easing and that the black market foreign exchange will not be supplied. The market unanimously bought in. The sellers were hesitant to move due to the turbulent situation. So they called out to each other. The first board of 20s Double Horse factory singles has risen above the limit-up level to 2,170 yuan and should be announced as limit-up. Outside the market, trades were made at 2,220 yuan. Then, as those who made a profit came out, the momentum slightly eased to 2,185 yuan. However, the exchange's first board rose sharply by 80-90 yuan. The second board also hit limit-up. So morale was revived and rose again to 2,215 yuan. In the afternoon, since the board had exceeded the limit-up, the market was closed as usual. As for the spot yarn Hakka Gang transactions, they were completely stagnant. Only the "pigskin" transactions among peers had a turnover of 8,000 bales. On the export side, it was heard today that 20 pieces of Japanese yarn were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Gold Double Horse Also Keeps Pace</p>
<p>Gold Double Horse futures rose sharply. The factory order opened and immediately announced limit-up. The October futures closed the last day at 1,890 yuan. November opened at 1,997 yuan, up 100 yuan, immediately hitting limit-up. December opened at 2,045 yuan, also limit-up. After entering October, it rose to a high of 1,918 yuan as the afternoon closing price. After tracing in the afternoon, trading continued. The October futures closed short, rising more than 20 yuan again, closing at 1,945 yuan, closing up 89 yuan. The November and December futures saw profit-taking and slightly eased, each rising by about 90 yuan. The intensity of the rise was expected by this newspaper long ago. The softness of the market price a few days ago was actually due to the panic caused by the international situation. So as soon as there was easing, there was a sudden surge. However, although the current trend is still subject to other unpredictable rumors, from a general observation, regardless of the situation, the lack of local cotton and the arrival of foreign cotton should be noted in terms of cost. A list is provided below.</p>
<h3>The Cessation of Black Market Foreign Exchange Supply is Rampant</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday saw no change in the listed prices of the Central Bank and HSBC. HSBC's small counter price remained stable. Black market speculators of British and American foreign exchange once again released various rumors about the Equalization Fund abandoning the maintenance of the local black market exchange rate, causing a general sense of terror among those who were unaware of the underlying circumstances. Suppliers suddenly disappeared again. After opening in the morning, it was heard that an importer who was not allowed to apply was willing to pay 3.75 yuan for US dollars. The seller never offered a price. A hidden chaotic situation prevailed. US dollar bills soared to 33 yuan, making US dollars even tighter at only 3.125 yuan. At noon, those who were willing to pay slackened their intentions as the price was too expensive, and the situation slightly eased. There was little change in the afternoon, and no transactions were heard all day. According to the evening closing price, the British exchange rate was approximately 2 shillings and 1.25 pence, and the US exchange rate was 3.25 yuan. Compared to last Saturday afternoon, the British exchange rate tightened by 1.25 pence, and the US exchange rate tightened by 6.25 pence.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds rise sharply by 15 yuan along with the cash price. British gold bills also rose sharply by 6 yuan. US dollar bills rose as high as 33 yuan before suddenly retreating to 30 yuan in the afternoon, eventually settling at 30.05 yuan, up 2.25 yuan. There was also strong demand for Hong Kong bills, and the market price rose by 0.3 yuan. The rise in Japanese gold bills was rampant, with the evening market rising to 2.81 yuan. Korean bills also followed, rising to 2.13 yuan.</p>
<h3>High Cotton Prices Lead to Fewer Transactions</h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation continued to rise due to rumors, but transactions were quite few and have entered a stagnant state. Yesterday, there were still Lan Gong Indian cotton transactions, and the price was more than ten yuan higher than last week. Most of the holders have unlimited confidence, resulting in higher prices but lower volume.</p>
<p>Lan Gong 100 bales 530.0 Haojia Jin</p>
<p>Again 200 bales 535.0 Again</p>
<p>Again 100 bales 540.0 Again</p>
<p>Again 200 bales 543.0 Again</p>
<p>Again 200 bales 555.0 Again</p>
<p>Again 100 bales 55.5 Again</p>
<h3>Rice Market Full of Buying Voices, Fortunately Public Bond Rice Is Released, Slightly Curbing the Tax Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rise in foreign rice became more intense. Since being raised by the influence of the international situation, people are mostly bullish. Yesterday, there was also talk of stopping the supply of foreign exchange, and people were even more excited. Inside and outside the industry, all hoarders rushed to absorb, and the market was full of buying voices. Floating multi-scattered households took the opportunity to be active, and the "pigskin" rush was exciting. The market price rose step by step. Small-grained current rice opened at 140 yuan and rose all the way to 145 yuan. No. 1 Saigon reached 156-7 yuan, which was 5-6-7 yuan higher than the previous market. Yinghua Si's small-grained rice also rose from 167 yuan to 169 yuan. The rapid rise could not be stopped. It was later heard that the Municipal Council had released a batch of small-grained rice, and the market immediately fell by 4-5 yuan. The small-grained rice returned to 140 yuan, but in the afternoon it returned to 144-5 yuan. Before the market closed, it was confirmed that 1,500 tons of publicly sold small-grained rice had been released, and the price began to stabilize slightly, closing at 143 yuan, which was still 4-5 yuan higher than last Saturday. No less than 3-40,000 bags were traded. Another 1,000 tons were traded.</p>
<p>The domestic rice market for thick and thin, newly broken, and two japonica rice types, although the arrival of goods was not weak, with a total of 400+ stone of newly broken and two japonica rice types arriving, the people's hearts were on edge, resulting in owners holding out for higher prices. However, the local shops did not dare to buy too much. The two japonica rice varieties increased by only 2-3 yuan each. Kai Nanport Early Broken Rice opened at 158-9 yuan. Kunshan New Japonica rice opened at 157-8 yuan, Qingjiao kiln species and Fengjing Bai Ge opened at 159 yuan, settling on 157.5 yuan. Dujian still lacked goods and was not marketed.</p>
<p>The market for glutinous rice was most popular due to the prolonged interruption of supply and near-exhaustion of goods. Customers were apprehensive of running out of goods, causing the market to be most popular. Under the hoarding of goods by the owners, the price continued to rise sharply. Hong Kong Gaobai Yuan opened at 172 yuan, and the inferior goods also required 168-9 yuan. Glutinous Lv opened at 161 yuan, settling on 159 yuan, an increase of 8-9 yuan compared to the week before.</p>
<h3>Domestic Debt Still Lacking Revitalization</h3>
<p>The gray market for public bonds was still weak yesterday. Although the Sichuan gang did not release spot goods, there was a large amount of spot goods congestion. In addition, credit was tight. The general mentality of the market was that buying public bonds was equivalent to depositing legal tender in a bank, with the idea that profits are small but stable, which cannot be compared with other types of speculation that rise and fall sharply. At present, due to unfavorable circumstances, it is impossible to raise the price. In the morning, Xinhua, Yitai, Jiufeng, and Tongkang bought in, and the market price briefly saw a high side. However, later Zhongfu, Changji, Xinfeng, Xinfu, and Zhenkang sold off, either with many long positions coming out, or spot goods being released, and the buyers were completely for short covering. The noon closing price was still below last Saturday's closing price. In the afternoon, Xinhua, Yitai, Jiucheng, and Lianhe covered their positions, but Zhenkang still sold off. Hongda, Runxun, and Shunqin all sold off, and the market gradually weakened. Type C was traded at a small price of 8.4 yuan, and the future is still less optimistic. As a result, the market prices were slightly lower by 1.5 to 3 corners than on all except for Type B. The total turnover was 1.8 to 1.9 million yuan. A brief and clear table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Sanyou Industrial Society were traded at a price of 29 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The stock market in the Public Industry Hall initially rose by many parties, and the opening price was close to the high point of last week. After the opening, due to the excessive rebound, the profit-takers dumped and the short-sellers took the opportunity to push down. The price fell step by step, and the market closed at almost the lowest price of the day.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>The sugar market rose sharply yesterday because of the rampant rumor that foreign exchange supply to Shanghai would be stopped. In the Guild's allocation, the spot price of Grade 24 coarse white sugar in October import rose from 219 yuan to 235 yuan, September from 217 yuan to 234 yuan, August from 216 yuan to 233 yuan, and July from 212 yuan to 232 yuan, all rising by 24-5 yuan. Hong Kong goods also rose directly from 197 yuan to 218 yuan, closing at 216 yuan, up 27 yuan. Dutch red opened at 185 yuan, returning to 81 yuan in the middle, and the morning closing was still 85 yuan. The afternoon tightened again to 188 yuan to 196 yuan, up 19 yuan. Taikoo Grade C White rose from 215 yuan to 230 yuan, up 22 yuan. HX Mark rose from 203 yuan to 5 yuan, and rose from 15 yuan to 18 yuan in the afternoon, up 21 yuan. H Mark was also 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Rises Straight Up</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market trend was yesterday, and hoarding flourished again due to the rumor that the Equalization Fund would stop the supply of foreign exchange. The selling price rose sharply, with plain white cloth and twill rising by 1 to 2 yuan. The opening prices for bleached and dyed cloth and flannel varied, rising by about 1 yuan. More than 1,000 pieces were traded on this street, with hoarding accounting for the majority of purchases. On the 21st, twelve pieces of cloth were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Speculation Permeates the Grain Market</h3>
<p>In the grain market yesterday, a speculative atmosphere permeated, and both insiders and outsiders eagerly competed to buy, leading to a uniform rise in prices. Consequently, cooking oil surged by as much as ten yuan, soybeans rose by about two yuan, corn soared by three to five yuan. The total market sales included fifty barrels of Qingdao raw oil, thirty barrels of soybean oil, one hundred and fifty barrels of Dalian soybean oil, fifty barrels of Jiangbei soybean oil, two hundred cans of raw oil, twenty cases of Jiaozhou raw oil, five hundred dan of Dayou Factory refined oil, three thousand dan of various factories' vegetable oil, and over two hundred packages of Tianjin Jinyuan.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Decides to Request Authorization from the Consular Body to Manage Retail Prices; Adds a "New Appendix" to the Land Regulations; Relies on the Cooperation of Importers and Firms to Control the Prices of Essential Goods as an Initial Action</h3>
<p>According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, regarding the matter of price control, the Council held two meetings on the 18th and 20th of this month for detailed discussions. As a result, it was resolved to request the Consular Body to approve a "New Appendix" to the Land Regulations, authorizing the Council to formulate regulations regarding the management of retail prices of essential goods. Recently, the public has been paying close attention to this issue. The Council believes it should clearly announce its established policy. The Council believes that the urgent task in the current situation is to find ways to control speculation and profiteering in essential goods. On the other hand, the Council is well aware that it should not interfere with normal business operations in any way, so as not to affect the import of essential goods into Shanghai. Without the cooperation of merchants, price management cannot be fully effective, except if the management agency can control the source of goods and prohibit the re-export of goods. However, since neither of these two methods is applicable to the Council, the Council's initial efforts should focus on managing the retail prices of certain essential goods, while relying on the cooperation of importers and firms.</p>
<p>The Entire City's Merchants and Residents Should Exercise Self-Restraint</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was decided that the public should not expect that many goods will soon be placed under control, as the Council's decisions are based on management methods that can be implemented and are deemed by the Council to be effective for the benefit of the public. The management of the prices of major goods will be implemented gradually, while full consultations will be held with relevant parties. The Council has no intention of interfering with the legitimate profits of importers, wholesalers, and retailers. However, one point needs to be solemnly declared: if the authority that the Council intends to request can be obtained, then price management can be implemented, and there is no need to worry about bias in the handling of certain cases. Finally, the public is advised that the way to protect themselves is not to hoard goods for private use, so as not to fuel speculation and profiteering.</p>
<p>The Council's Proposed Measures Can Be Approved Immediately</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement held a Council meeting at 9:30 this morning (the 20th) in the Council building, lasting 35 minutes, and resolved to draft an appendix to be submitted to the Shanghai Consular Body for approval, in order to control retail prices and illegal profiteering within the Settlement. It is reported that the Council already held a meeting last Saturday noon and the new appendix drafted is expected to be submitted to the Consular Body this afternoon and approved within a few days. This morning, an official of the Municipal Council explained that the new appendix does not require the approval of the taxpayers, as the taxpayers had already passed a resolution at the annual meeting, granting the Municipal Council full authority to take this step. As far as can be known this morning, the methods that the Municipal Council will adopt to control retail prices and illegal profiteering are similar to those taken by the French Concession, and will be carried out in full cooperation with the French Municipal Council, as any measures would be difficult to be fully effective without cooperation between the two concessions.</p>
<p>Coal Briquette Prices Are Already Under Discussion</p>
<p>Regarding the control measures taken by the French Municipal Council last week, the Director-General of the Council, Tan Gutie, was unable to issue any comments, but stated that he was waiting for the authorities of the International Settlement to take steps, and then both sides could be expected to cooperate more closely to deal with the current situation. It is reported that the authorities of the two concessions have already begun discussions on controlling the price of coal briquettes, and a decision can be expected within a few days. At the same time, the price of ordinary bread in Shanghai rose by another four jiao today. Cognac Hennessy V.S.O.P. increased to one hundred and twenty-five yuan per bottle, and Hennessy X.O. increased to one hundred and seventy-five yuan per bottle, and only one bottle can be purchased per customer. The French Municipal Council's Price Evaluation Committee also held an important meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Vina, with representatives from the rice industry, firewood and coal industry, Chinese and foreign grocery industry, soy sauce industry, and fresh meat industry participating. Officials from the Municipal Council and the police force attended the meeting. In addition to each industry reporting on market conditions, the issue of prices was also discussed.</p>
<p>Flour Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>The Flour Noodle Manufacturers Association sent representatives on the 13th of this month to petition the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, requesting that it directly purchase flour, transport it to Shanghai for sale at fair prices, and actively find ways to suppress the price of flour and crack down on illegal hoarding. At yesterday's meeting, the Council specifically discussed the stabilization of the flour market and resolved to directly purchase flour and transport it to Shanghai for sale at fair prices. However, according to a reporter from the "New Voice News Agency", some flour merchants, blinded by profit, are single-mindedly aiming to obtain illegal profits and deliberately raising prices for profiteering, resulting in continuous sharp increases in flour prices in recent days. All mechanized noodle shops in Shanghai have been affected by the sharp increase in flour prices and have requested the association to allow them to appropriately increase the price of noodles in order to maintain their capital. The association, in order to take care of the business of its members, has approved the request of the members to increase the price of noodles from today, with a uniform price of 8.5 jiao per market jin, not to exceed the limit. The price of cut noodles is 8.7 jiao, the price of machine-made noodles is 8.5 jiao, and the price of flour is 1 yuan, all calculated per market jin.</p>
<p>The Rice Bureau Orders Rice</p>
<p>The price of rice rises daily, and the people's food is difficult to obtain. Yesterday, the number of bags of Municipal Council rice that rice shops applied to the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. to purchase increased to more than 10,000 bags. The responsible person of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. approved all the requests. However, in order to prevent hoarding, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. stipulated that rice shops that have purchased Municipal Council rice from rice retailers in the past will not be allowed to continue to purchase Municipal Council rice from Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. until the Municipal Council rice of that rice shop has been sold out. Only after the Municipal Council rice stored in the rice shop has been sold out will the shop be allowed to purchase more.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador Travels from Hong Kong to Chongqing</h3>
<p>The Belgian Ambassador to China, Baron Guillaume, and his wife, after returning to Shanghai, have been engaged in numerous social engagements. In order to maintain close contact with the Chinese government, they left Shanghai last week on a transport to Hong Kong and then flew to Chongqing on a flight to pay respects to the central authorities in the capital.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Foreign Exchange Not Being Maintained Are Firmly Denied; Market Fluctuations Are Entirely Due to a Lack of Common Sense; Foreign Exchange Allocation Methods Are Generally Lenient</h3>
<p>After an irresponsible report was published by the Associated Press, stating that sources in Washington, D.C., and London anticipated that, as a result of meetings currently being held in Chongqing and Hong Kong, the United States and the United Kingdom may no longer assist the Chinese government in continuing to stabilize the exchange rate of the legal tender in Shanghai, the Shanghai black market experienced extreme volatility yesterday. Foreign exchange shrank dramatically, and cotton yarn rose by seventy-nine yuan at the opening, immediately halting trading. Cash reached a new high of 13,000 yuan, causing widespread panic and extreme chaos. In fact, the above report is completely inaccurate. Responsible parties firmly denied it to a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday. According to an official of the Exchange Stabilization Fund in Shanghai, this rumor completely lacks common sense. The Exchange Stabilization Fund has been working to stabilize the legal tender for four years, why would it destroy its efforts in one day? There is no reason to stop maintaining the legal tender at this time, and the Exchange Stabilization Fund will never do so. In order to avoid wasting funds and cracking down on speculative activities, the Exchange Stabilization Fund has strictly defined methods for managing the Shanghai foreign exchange market, but it has never hindered the development of legitimate trade. This is a commonly seen and heard fact. Now, in order to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants, the Exchange Stabilization Fund will allow importers who had foreign orders before the management of the Shanghai foreign exchange market began on August 18, and who have not yet been supplied with foreign exchange, to apply to the Exchange Stabilization Fund for the supply of foreign exchange in writing through the handling bank. This is sufficient proof of the leniency of the Exchange Stabilization Fund's measures.</p>
<h3>American Troops Ordered to Cooperate in Preventing Atrocities Within Their Defense Zone; Colonel Howard Orders All Officers and Soldiers to Act at Any Time, Whether on Duty or Not</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", the headquarters of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai announced today (the 20th) that the commander of the regiment, Colonel Howard, has ordered all American officers and soldiers in the regiment, whether on duty or not, to take all actions within their authority to prevent acts of terrorism in the American defense zone. This order was issued last Saturday and stated that terrorist acts have recently occurred several times in the American defense zone.</p>
<p>Therefore, all officers and soldiers in the regiment are warned to be especially careful, whether on duty or not, to prevent terrorist acts. It can be seen from this that American soldiers who are not armed and are not on duty will also take all possible actions to prevent terrorist acts against any person or property and to arrest those who attempt to commit such acts. The American defense zone is Zone "C" of the International Settlement, bounded by the Suzhou Creek to the north, Avenue Foch to the south, and Yu Yaqing Road to the east. Although there have been frequent reports of American soldiers who were not on duty interfering in cases of robbery and catching criminals, it is believed to be the first time in history that they have been ordered to maintain order within their defense zone even when not on duty.</p>
<p>Previous orders issued by American commanders had stipulated plans for American soldiers to assist the police during public emergencies and political anniversaries. However, the new order issued today allows American soldiers to take the initiative in preventing terrorist acts, and they can decide how to enforce the law themselves without waiting for the police to arrive. When reporters asked Shi Maoru, the acting director of the Shanghai Municipal Police, about this order, Shi declined to comment, saying that he had not received a copy of the order. The reporter then read the order aloud, but Shi still did not explicitly state whether the order would help the police in suppressing terrorist acts. He said, "I have not seen this order, and I am extremely busy with official duties. Please excuse me for not saying more," and then hung up the phone. The order issued by Colonel Howard and signed by Executive Officer Lieutenant Colonel Curtis is as follows: "The Operations and Training Order of this Regiment has previously clearly stipulated that in certain situations, the officers and soldiers of this Regiment will assist the Shanghai Municipal Police</p>
<p>and, in emergencies, replace the work normally performed by the police. Due to the recent recurrence of several terrorist acts in the American defense zone, all officers and soldiers of this Regiment, whether on duty or not, must be especially careful to prevent the continuation of terrorist acts in this zone and take all actions within their authority in accordance with existing orders to prevent terrorist acts against any person or property and to arrest those who attempt to commit such acts."</p>
<h3>The "Dartagnan" Ship Had an Accident Yesterday</h3>
<p>The French Postal Shipping Company's postal ship, "Dartagnan," which loaded over 8,500 bags of corn and over 3,500 items of cotton from Saigon, and 1.18 million feet of lumber from Little Luzon, arrived in Shanghai last Friday (the 17th), berthed at buoys 11 and 12. It unloaded the lumber first, and then moved to the Shunqin Wharf to unload corn, cotton, and other goods. At around 3:00 PM yesterday, while unloading lumber, the cotton inside the ship suddenly caught fire due to carelessness. Thick smoke billowed straight up, and the fire blazed fiercely. The shipowner learned of this and immediately ordered the raising of the distress flag. The Pudong Lujiazui Customs Fireboat saw this and rushed to the postal ship to pour water to extinguish the fire. It was not until around 5:00 PM that the fire was extinguished. The loss is reported to be very large, but the exact amount is unknown.</p>
<h3>Storing Too Much Kerosene and Gasoline Poses a Fire Hazard; The Fire Department Begins Investigation and Issues Warnings</h3>
<p>According to a public notice from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, many residents, in addition to illegal hoarders, are purchasing and storing excessive amounts of dangerous liquids such as kerosene and gasoline, creating a serious fire hazard. In view of this, the Council's Fire Department, in order to protect the lives and property of citizens, has dispatched personnel to investigate many houses. Once discovered, warnings will be issued, and if necessary, public prosecutions will be filed with the court for punishment. The Fire Department filed multiple public prosecution cases in July, August, and September regarding the storage of excessive amounts of dangerous goods such as kerosene, gasoline, alcohol, and celluloid. The courts have imposed separate penalties as a warning. The Department welcomes reports of the storage of excessive amounts of these dangerous goods and hopes that citizens will cooperate to remove the danger of fire.</p>
<h3>Curfew Hours Will Revert to the Old Clock Time Next Month</h3>
<p>Daylight saving time in the two concessions has been set to be abolished starting at 0:00 on the 2nd of next month. The clock will be turned back one hour to restore the old clock time. The curfew time will also change at the same time and will be enforced according to the old clock time.</p>
<h3>Sales of Commemorative Stamps Also Have a Black Market</h3>
<p>The commemorative stamps for the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China were completely sold out after only two days of sales, and many people were unable to purchase them. It is now known that merchants specializing in the sale of commemorative stamps are taking advantage of the public's need to raise the price of those they have previously purchased for sale, just like other commodities that have a black market. This is rare in previous sales of commemorative stamps.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Regular Meeting This Week</h3>
<p>The regular meeting of the Shanghai Rotary Club this week is scheduled to be held at the Metropole Hotel at noon on October 23 (Sunday). At that time, Mr. Adamson, Secretary of the Navy YMCA who has come to Shanghai from Hankou and a member of the Club, will give a lecture on the topic of "Shooting Techniques."</p>

<h3>The "General" Series of Three Postal Ships Has Changed Routes; Transferred to the Navy Department, Plans to Temporarily Not Sail to Shanghai; American Cargo Ships Continue to Undertake Shanghai-America Cargo Transportation as Usual</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the turbulent conditions of the Pacific Ocean, the voyage of merchant ships has been changed repeatedly. Shanghai is a neutral port, and American ships should continue to maintain shipping between Shanghai and America. However, according to ocean shipping industry, the maintenance of Shanghai-America shipping by American ships is difficult to guarantee if changes occur in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>New Routes for Three Ships</p>
<p>It is also learned that the "President" series of postal ships operated by the American President Lines on the Pacific route—the "President Cleveland," "President Taft," and "President Pierce"—have now been renamed the "General" series and transferred to the U.S. Navy Department. There is a rumor that the routes have changed and they will not come to Shanghai temporarily. It is heard that the new voyage will start from San Francisco, travel directly to Little Luzon via Honolulu, travel from Little Luzon to Hong Kong, and then travel directly from Hong Kong to Honolulu, returning to San Francisco. It is not yet certain whether the postal ship "President Coolidge" will still travel on the original route or change separately. The company's World Line postal ships only go as far as Singapore.</p>
<p>Ships Sailing to Shanghai</p>
<p>Those ships traveling directly from Honolulu to Shanghai, then to Hong Kong, Little Luzon, and various Nanyang ports to Singapore, and then returning to Shanghai and back to America on the original route from Singapore, include two World Line ships this month, passing through Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to Singapore, and one ship coming from Singapore to Shanghai and returning to America. The names and dates of the ships are being kept secret, so they cannot be specified.</p>
<p>Bain's Talk</p>
<p>Bain, an American government consultant, recently arrived in Manila by clipper. According to Bain, American ships can now travel from the east coast of the United States to the Red Sea, unload wartime supplies for England, and then sail to Singapore and Manila in the Far East, and then transport the products of the two places to the United States. After this type of navigation is decided, the difficulty of the shortage of tonnage of ships sailing between the United States and the Philippines can be relieved. If the Pacific deteriorates, the U.S. Wartime Navy Department will make every effort to maintain the issue of American ship passage. We have every reason to believe that as long as ship navigation is maintained and not interrupted, American goods and wartime raw materials will be transported as usual to Singapore, Manila, Hong Kong, and other Far Eastern ports including Shanghai. This is true not only for ships transporting wartime supplies, but also for other ships. It is learned that Dr. Bain went to the United States this summer and is responsible for the role of a "de facto" dictator. Bain will remain in the Philippines until the end of this year and will travel to various distant places in the future. The task he is responsible for is regarding the control of oil-related matters. According to Bain's statement, the United States has decided to maintain shipping to the Pacific and Far Eastern ports. The implication is clear.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Entry Restrictions Are Becoming Increasingly Strict; Those Permitted to Enter Hong Kong Are Limited to Leaving Within Six Months</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Immigration Department has issued a new order canceling entry permits issued within six months as invalid, so that those who want to go to Hong Kong without an immigration permit or entry permit outside of Hong Kong must have someone in Hong Kong pay a deposit of HK$100 to the Immigration Department in advance, obtain a formal receipt, and after the entrant arrives in Shanghai to complete the entry permit procedures, they must hold the receipt to the Immigration Department to retrieve the deposit. It is also stipulated that those who pay the deposit must have previously held a six-month or expired entry permit in Hong Kong in order to be effective. Otherwise, there must be a review procedure. If the person is allowed to pay the deposit to enter Hong Kong, they are limited to leaving Hong Kong within six months. Those who overstay will be ordered to leave.</p>
<h3>A Gathering of White Russians Was Prohibited Without Permission</h3>
<p>According to the "China Press," representatives of various White Russian groups in Shanghai recently gathered on October 2 to discuss how to promote the collection of income tax from White Russians to cope with the large expenditures of the White Russian Immigration Committee. The representatives originally scheduled to gather yesterday (the 19th) afternoon at the Public Canteen for Aiding White Russians at 764 Rue Bourgeat to continue discussions, but this was prohibited by the French police, resulting in the cancellation of yesterday's meeting. It is planned to find a way to hold another meeting next week. According to reliable sources, the French police did not issue the necessary permit for yesterday's meeting, for unknown reasons. However, it is generally believed that the French police are following the policy of prohibiting all political gatherings within the Concession, hence this action.</p>
<h3>American Consul General Announces Changes to Nationality Law</h3>
<p>The American Consul General announced yesterday that, according to the new law passed by the House of Representatives, naturalized American citizens lose their American citizenship only after residing outside of American territory for more than two years. It is said that this provision is different from the Nationality Law stipulated in 1940. The 1940 law stipulated that naturalized American citizens, except in specified special circumstances, would be considered to have lost their citizenship after residing outside of American territory for one year from the date of approval of that law. The new law passed by the House of Representatives this time has extended the period from one year to two years. Therefore, the effective period of citizenship of naturalized Americans is until October 14, 1942.</p>
<h3>Goods for Comforting Soviet Troops Have Been Loaded on a Ship and Shipped to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Times", the first batch of comfort goods collected by the Russian-language newspaper in the city, totaling 31 boxes, about 1,000 packages, were loaded yesterday (the 19th) on a certain ship managed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and shipped to Hong Kong, and then directly transferred to Vladivostok, to be distributed by the Soviet authorities. The comfort goods include winter clothing, candy, tea, coffee, cigarettes, razors, and other items. They were donated by Russian expatriates in Shanghai who enthusiastically responded to the donation campaign launched by the Russian-language newspaper.</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications Establishes a Branch in India; The Rangoon Branch Is Expanded</h3>
<p>In order to develop trade between Burma, India, South Africa, and other places and China, the Bank of Communications has decided to establish a branch in Calcutta, India. Preparations have been completed, and it is expected to open for business in early November. Wen Wanqing, the former manager of the Guangzhou branch, has been transferred to serve as the manager of the branch. As for the Rangoon branch, it has recently been expanded, adding one assistant manager and several staff members. Peng Xianzhan, the assistant manager of the Hong Kong branch, has been transferred to serve as the assistant manager.</p>
<h3>After the Collapse of the "Slippery" Qianzhuang, the Assistant Manager Remains at Large; The Trial of Four Arrested Criminals Has Concluded and a Sentence Date Has Been Set</h3>
<p>Since the report on the 14th of this month that the Huikang Qianzhuang at No. 10 Jiyi Lane, Tianjin Road, collapsed after only one day of opening, the assistant manager, Huang Kefu, is still at large. Yesterday morning, the General Inspectorate transferred the four shareholders of the Qianzhuang who had been apprehended—Chen Huiwei, Wang Yifan, Gu Yaokui, and Xu Zhandao—to the Fifth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. The Inspectorate's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted them according to the law and stated the facts of the case, saying that the Inspectorate, in a subsequent search, found a formal contract on the upper floor of No. 437 Nanjing Road. All five shareholders in the contract had signed it. In addition, Tongchang Car Company on Yunnan Road had deposited a check for 1,000 yuan and a check for 30 yuan into the Qianzhuang, as well as 635 yuan in cash. After reading the news of the Qianzhuang's collapse, they stopped payment on the two checks, so the loss was only 635 yuan in cash. In addition, He Yongji, the owner of Ruitai Clothing Store at No. 189 Fujian Road, deposited 2,500 yuan in banknotes, but withdrew 2,000 yuan the next day after the opening, so the actual loss was 500 yuan. It was found that the Huikang Qianzhuang's premises were rented from the landlord for 400 yuan per month, with three months' rent paid in advance, totaling 1,200 yuan. Since the Qianzhuang only opened for a few days, one month's rent should be deducted, and the remaining two months' rent is 800 yuan, which the Inspectorate is now trying to recover. The items found at the Qianzhuang included four desks, eight chairs, and passbooks and checkbooks, as well as other soft items totaling more than 2,400 yuan. When questioned, the defendants gave conflicting testimonies and hired lawyers such as Fan Gang to defend them in court. Judge Dai reviewed the confessions and ordered the defendants to be held in custody pending sentencing in seven days.</p>
<h3>An Explosion Suddenly Occurred on the Robiquet Road Bridge, Destroying Several Wooden Planks</h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Times," an explosion suddenly occurred at 11:15 last night (the 19th) on the Robiquet Road Bridge near the entrance to the Hongqiao Recreation Club at the corner of Robiquet Road and Hongqiao Road. With a loud bang, several wooden planks were destroyed, but traffic could still pass. At the time of the explosion, a member of the Hongqiao Club happened to be driving his car there and narrowly escaped being hit. Fortunately, the car stopped, preventing the accident.</p>
<h3>A Shoe-Shining Girl Was Enticed into Prostitution; Zhou Yunxian Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Xu Guiying, the sixteen-year-old daughter of Xu Li, a woman from Jiangbei who lived at No. 32 Ping An Lane, Avenue Edward VII, was introduced to work at the "Lovely Women's" shoe-shining company at No. 195 Fuzhou Road at the intersection of Yu Yaqing Road on January 20 of this year. However, Zhou Yunxian, a female colleague at the company, saw that Xu was young and easily deceived, so she used sweet words to entice her, saying that the salary here was quite small, and that it would be much more profitable to go to Beiping together. Xu did not know her plan, so she followed her home. Unexpectedly, Zhou colluded with Xu Chunjiang, Bu Afu, Bu Mama, etc., and took Xu to Beiping, where she was sold to a brothel for 700 yuan and forced into prostitution. Xu refused and took the opportunity to escape, throwing herself under passing cars on the road in an attempt to commit suicide. The police took her to the station, learned the facts, arrested the Bu couple, and notified Xu's mother in Shanghai to send someone to Beiping to take her daughter back.

<h3>"Only Studying Makes One Superior"</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ping</p>
<p>Faithfully Recommending "New Books of the World"</p>
<p>Tao Kangde is a cultural toiler who is always buried in piles of books. Writing articles, translating books, and editing magazines are his daily life. In addition to editing *Cosmic Wind Bimonthly* and *Affairs of the World*, he has recently put his plan into practice and successively published several "New Books of the World."</p>
<p>Last winter, when I was chatting with him, he planned to publish a series of books. He said that the books must be substantial, beneficial when opened, and flavorful when closed. Although the world is turbulent and people are uneasy, good books will definitely be read. Precisely because in this great era, books are even more needed by people. In early summer this year, he told me that the *World Series* had been successively put into print, with plans to publish ten volumes by the end of this year. Now, seven or eight kinds have been published. This is a rich harvest for him and his translator friends, and a fine food for readers. I admire his hard-working and persevering spirit.</p>
<p>"The Best of Western Magazine Articles" consists of four volumes, totaling about 600,000 words, and has been fully published. The title "The Best of Western Magazine Articles" truly lives up to its name. Originally, this book is a collection of articles published in the famous American "Reader's Digest" over the past eighteen years. "Reader's Digest" is a magazine loved by everyone, with a circulation of more than four million copies. The reasons why it is loved by everyone are: first, the content involves a wide range of fields, including astronomy, geography, customs, history, science, nature, landscapes, and figures, encompassing everything; second, the selected articles are written in a popular and timeless style, concise and to the point, suitable for both young and old, men and women. The content of one issue of Reader's Digest is already dazzling and beautiful. Now, this collection is selected from two hundred and sixteen issues and five or six thousand excellent works, so its brilliance is beyond words. As for this complete translation, the clarity and conciseness of the translation can be said to be the icing on the cake for this book.</p>
<p>"Behind the German Lines" is a true record of the life of the foreign correspondent of the Chicago Tribune during his work in Germany. He wrote it after he left Germany. Regarding everything in wartime Germany, from military and political plans to civilian life, he speaks freely and without restraint. The whole book is about 200,000 words, and reading it is better than taking a trip behind the German lines.</p>
<p>The author of "On the London Front Line" is a long-time resident of London, so he is more suited to describe the shocking experiences of London. This book describes the wartime life as perceived by ordinary Londoners from various perspectives. He does not make any judgments, nor does he make any final verdicts. His intention is only to give people an impression of the current stage of the war, but to allow people to see what kind of life the people living on this small island have lived in this great war in the past fifteen months. The whole book has thirty chapters and two hundred thousand words. Wartime London leaps off the page.</p>
<p>"World Articles" includes twenty-one exquisite short articles, discussing how to be a person, birth control, family, alimony, women, war, literati, and exposing social evils, etc., full of interest.</p>
<p>"New Books of the World" is the general name of this series of books. Each book is engraved with the seal of the child prodigy poem "Only Studying Makes One Superior", which is elegant and worthy of a good book.</p>

<h3>Qianzhuang Accountant and Others' Private Speculation Failed; Embezzled 280,000 Yuan of Zhuang Funds and Was Detained</h3>
<p>Cunyi Qianzhuang at No. 20 Jiangxi Road specializes in selling cotton yarn, scarlet gold, and other businesses for customers. Recently, Chen Guanying from Yong, Luo Yongmao from Shaoxing, and apprentice Chen Zhixin, the accountants of the Qianzhuang, were tempted by the benefits of speculation and privately engaged in cotton yarn and scarlet gold. Unexpectedly, every transaction resulted in losses. The losses had to be paid, but Chen and others were not wealthy. Therefore, they misappropriated the certificates and balances paid by the customers of the Qianzhuang. Until recently, manager Sun Jiasheng discovered that the Qianzhuang funds were short by about 280,000 yuan. He reported it to the Central Police Station. Hua Detective Song Yuanshan and detective Yang Zaishan investigated and found out that the shortage of funds was entirely due to Chen and the other two's private speculation and misappropriation. They were arrested and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Bao briefly stated the case and requested a postponement of the hearing because the accounts had not yet been clarified. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered them to be detained pending a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<h3>Announcement of the Fifth Essay Contest; Trying to Steal a Chicken but Losing the Rice—A Lesson I Learned—</h3>
<p>— Ding Xian</p>
<p>Prices and salaries are like a race between a rabbit and a turtle. However, it is not the rabbit that can jump and bounce that naps on the way, but unexpectedly, it is the turtle that will never try to win that loses!</p>
<p>My wife's complexion is withering day by day; the children are crying and clamoring for this and that; and the old mother's dried intestines, which often cannot eat oily food, are surprisingly hungry, almost becoming a kind of pathological symptom. No wonder, the nutrition of life is too lacking for us.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, how could I ignore it any longer? I had to find a way to remedy it. However, retrenchment has long been retrenched to the end of "flow". The only way is to develop new sources of income.</p>
<p>However, what legitimate ways are there for such a small and "legless" person to develop new sources of income? Desperate people will try any remedy. Finally, I blindly chose the path that I had always been unwilling to take but often wanted to take——speculation.</p>
<p>I exchanged my wife's only jewelry for capital and started to be an accomplice to the money-grubbers against my conscience. Surprisingly, the heavens did not disappoint the hardworking people. In the first month, the results were very satisfactory. I began to watch the prices of various goods rise with a calm and even eager mood. Although the profit was not enough, every time I bought and sold, I was eager to sell as soon as the price rose. However, I also made a lot of money. The family had vitality, and the solution to livelihood was unexpectedly so easy!</p>
<p>However, the storm came. The good times did not last long. A violent slump suddenly occurred in the market. The eyes of the people all changed to "looking down." Unfavorable rumors spread from all over, explaining all kinds of reasons for "looking down," as if this slump would never end. My "bullish thinking" was shaken. I hurriedly cut off the meat to "turn short" at a small loss. However, the God of Fortune was playing a joke on me. The market suddenly reversed and rose sharply. I received a so-called "two-sided slap" in the market jargon. A thousand days of collecting firewood are burned in one day, and the hard work of one month is not enough to cover.</p>
<p>Trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice, I could not just give up. I still had to find a way to do it. However, from that time on, I had lost the control of management. Whether I went long or short, the result was always the opposite. My capital became shorter and shorter, my thoughts became colder and colder, and my policy became more and more chaotic.</p>
<p>Fortunately, not long after, the bad times came to an end. From the concern of a friend, I got a secret message. I borrowed money by all means and paid the margin to the yarn store to buy ten packages of futures yarn. The friend's message was not false. A few days after I bought it, the market suddenly jumped. I was so excited that I almost wanted to cry. I doubted that I was dreaming. My heart could not stop jumping with the market. A strong taste of bitterness coming to an end strongly hit me. I thought that this time, I was saved.</p>
<p>However, when I was about to sell and dialed the phone number of the yarn store, the situation was a little different from usual. The bell on the other side rang very loudly, but no one answered. I shook it over and over again, but the result was the same. I couldn't help but panic. I rushed to the door of the yarn store. I saw the door open from a distance. My heart was happy. I calmly stepped into the door and looked at the writing room of the yarn store. It was half cold. I didn't expect that it was really empty. The door was locked. Instead of it was a lawyer's liquidation notice. The notice was written with dense small characters. I wanted to see it clearly, but my eyes were already blurred. I only saw the ink marks blooming and blooming, turning into many man-eating beasts, baring their teeth and claws and pouncing on me... I wanted to be angry, but I lost the courage; I wanted to cry, but I had no tears; After a while, I couldn't stop biting my lip and smiling bitterly at it. I thought: Not only can I not get the surplus, but I have also lost my capital. This is the biggest deception in the world, but who told me to throw myself in? ... I finally learned a lesson!</p>
<h3>The Eagle of Poland</h3>
<p>— Lin Tao</p>
<p>For their courageous fighting, the Polish pilots serving in the British Royal Air Force will become legendary heroes of this great war. They are fierce warriors because their lives have been stripped of all emotion by encountering the enemy, leaving only hatred for Hitler's iron fist and a desire for revenge. They have lost their homeland. Death is unimportant to them; only when they die can they strike a blow against the culprit of their tragedy.</p>
<p>The British Air Force Intelligence Department announced that the Polish pilots' battle achievements, their names are always kept strictly secret, because most of them have relatives and friends living in German territory. Since August of last year, the authorities have only broken one exception. That was Sergeant Pilot Josef Franciszek, whose name was announced after his death. His glorious flying medal was awarded for shooting down five German planes in a day and a half of fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Initially, the Poles' enthusiasm gave the British commanders a headache. On the ground, the Poles were obedient. But in the air, as long as there were enemies to attack, they refused to line up. If they were directed by radio, the only answer they would get was, "Don't bother, Englishman."</p>
<p>Most of the Polish airmen are scattered in the Air Force service teams, but there is a fighter squadron and a bomber squadron composed entirely of Poles. The Kosciusko Squadron is an old fighting unit that has been reorganized. Before Hitler's blitzkrieg, Poland had a Kosciusko Squadron. Its old-fashioned planes and inadequate equipment were, of course, no match for Hitler's superior air force. After fighting bravely, the aircrew fled, passing through the Balkans to France. There, they gathered with other Polish pilots, obtained some equipment, and returned to the air as a combat unit. When France surrendered, they fled to England. On August 1, 1940, they were incorporated into the British Air Force. It was stipulated that after a month of training, they should familiarize themselves with the use of machine guns and the maneuvering of aircraft before they could take to the skies to fight. But these young men couldn't wait. On August 30, the day before the team was scheduled to participate in the war, Franciszek shot down five German planes.</p>
<p>The final step in the bomber squadron's training was to have them take off with enough gasoline and bombs, as if they were going on a long-range bombing mission. Many planes rose haphazardly. They were supposed to return within a short time. But hours passed, and there was no response. The commander was anxious. Finally, these bombers circled down.</p>
<p>"Where have you been?" the commander asked sternly.</p>
<p>"Bombing Berlin," the Poles replied simply.</p>
<p>In September 1940, the most intense month of the war, the Kosciusko Squadron alone shot down 118 German planes. The day King George visited the squadron was the day the Poles celebrated shooting down thirteen German planes—one-third of the total number of German planes shot down by the Royal Air Force that day.</p>
<p>The Poles are brave flying generals. But they are also excellent pilots.</p>

<h3>Poison Cabinet</h3>
<p>— Ke Zhong</p>
<p>In ordinary families, there is often a medicine cabinet for emergencies. This type of medicine cabinet is most likely to arouse children's curiosity. If ordinary medicines are placed together with poisonous medicines, the danger is very great, and lives are at stake. In view of this, American furniture designers have specially added a small steel box to the medicine cabinet, equipped with a sturdy lock, specifically for storing poisons, to prevent children from accidentally taking them, which is also a new advancement in family equipment. Housewives in the country can also follow their example.</p>

<p>Fourteen: Living the Life of a Hero</p>
<p>When Qiu Haitang clutched the two ten-dollar bills, sneaking out of the Heda pawnshop as embarrassed as if he had committed some crime, at least two strings of hot tears were swallowed into his stomach along with a sour feeling.</p>
<p>On the second day after he arrived in Shanghai, he was given the cold shoulder by President Zou of the National Associated Bank and Master Zhang of Zhang's mansion on Julai Road. The former simply refused to see him, and although the latter reluctantly saw him, the moment he caught sight of Qiu Haitang's disreputable appearance and the tattered clothes he was wearing, his face immediately turned as if he hadn't eaten cooked rice porridge in months. Qiu Haitang was indeed still the Qiu Haitang of the past, but the Master Zhang who had once lauded Qiu Haitang to the thirty-third heaven seemed to have died.</p>
<p>On the third day, he hardly had the courage to look for the remaining few acquaintances, but the father and daughter couldn't just wait to starve to death, so he finally braced himself and found the home of a opera fan surnamed Hou.</p>
<p>This Old Mr. Hou was from Chaozhou, and his family ran several pawnshops. Even if he couldn't be considered a major pawnbroker, he at least had three or four hundred thousand in assets. Because he lived a leisurely life, he had become a large fat man weighing over one hundred ninety pounds under the law of "a broad mind and a fat body." But he liked to listen to opera, especially to the falsetto roles, and later, disregarding the earnest advice of many close friends and relatives, he also began to learn female roles. (241)</p>

<h3>"Transformation" of Doctor Ding</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>After watching Cao Yu's "Transformation" at the Carlton Theatre, I picked this topic. Because I was moved by this character in the play, deeply moved! Those "eliminated and rotten classes" aroused our disgust; they also set off the greatness of Doctor Ding, Commissioner Liang, and others.</p>
<p>The beginning of the second act, the conversation between Doctor Ding and her only son, Ding Chang, I think is an excellent article that "writes the tender heart of a loving mother," and it is worth selecting into junior high school Chinese textbooks as teaching material. When Doctor Ding heard that her son had lost his money, she gave him more money, personally putting some in both pockets; seeing that he had given his flannel shirt to someone else, she gave her own to her son who was a soldier. Later, when the air raid alarm came, almost everyone in the wounded soldier hospital had fled, but Doctor Ding was still wholeheartedly performing surgery for a wounded soldier who was at the critical moment of life and death. This spirit of sacrificing oneself is really worthy of our admiration and respect. I seemed to see her figure gradually growing bigger.</p>
<p>The third act writes about the conflict between Doctor Ding's reason and emotion, "Knowing that her son should still dedicate himself to the motherland after recovering from his injuries, but selfish maternal love seems to be preventing her from this idea. As a result, reason triumphed over everything, and she still took the initiative to delay her son's departure from the dangerous situation, determined to eliminate selfish maternal love." This also moved me.</p>
<p>Ms. Mu Gui, the author of "Carrying the Cross," didn't arrive to see the play until the beginning of the third act. I wanted to say to her, "You're late! It's a pity you didn't see the interesting situation where the large petals and small petals were connected when peeling oranges." This is what she used in her postscript, comparing it to the love between mother and son.</p>
<p>Ms. Danny's superb performance added to the brilliance of the script. She acted so naturally and skillfully that I forgot that she was acting, and I really thought she was the wounded soldiers, no, it should be said that she was the great mother of China.</p>
<h3>Not a Joke</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>The playwright George Bernard Shaw once danced with a woman at a charity ball, and suddenly heard her say, "Why would someone like you, a globally renowned scholar, dance with a poor woman?" "It's a charity ball today!" Shaw replied without hesitation.</p>
<p>The great musician Paderewski, after finishing his performance in front of Queen Victoria, received a warm welcome from the Emperor, who also called him a talented person. "Now I can indeed say that I am a talented person," Paderewski said with a hesitant attitude. "My Emperor! But before my talent was discovered, I could only be called a laborer!"</p>
<h3>Radio Notes</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>As far as I know, in families equipped with radios, most love to listen to Peking opera record programs, mainly because Peking opera itself is relatively popular in entertainment. Peking opera records are the carefully crafted masterpieces of famous actors, and there are many famous actors, such as Tan Xinpei, Sun Juxian, and Chen Delin, who have already passed away. Although we can no longer see them on the stage, we can still listen to "swan songs" from the records!</p>
<p>Many of the records broadcast on the radio are very valuable, but most of them are fragmented. The complete ones are only a few, such as Mei Lanfang and Yang Xiaolou's "Farewell My Concubine," Ma Lianliang and Wang Yurong's "Wujiapo," and Guan Shaohua and Wang Yurong's "Silang Visits His Mother." Therefore, listening to them is not enjoyable enough, and you may even get tired of listening. In the past, there were several radio stations that collected records of various famous actors and broadcast them sequentially. For example, the play "Hongyang Cave" collected records of Yu Shuyan, Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Wang Shaolou, Jin Shaoshan, etc. Such a "grand gathering of famous actors" that was completed in one go was naturally wonderfully continuous, and the audience also felt that it was interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p>The Democratic Radio Station has a program of "Complete Peking Opera" records every day from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, and on Sundays from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM. Their records can be said to be very complete. In the past, they have broadcast "Hongyang Cave," "The Case of the Black Pot," "The Universe Front," "Jade Hall Spring," "Catching Cao and Letting Him Go," "Searching for Orphans and Rescuing Orphans," "Scolding Cao," "Selling Horses," "Qionglin Banquet," and so on. It is truly good news for audiences who love to listen to complete Peking opera.</p>
<h3>Notes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Cun Ren</p>
<p>Guan Dayuan is coming to Shanghai again, re-affiliated with Gengxin. Qingyi Huang Guiqiu hangs the head card, and Guan ranks second. The proposal for Fu Ying and Jun Qiu to transfer to the troupe after the Great Stage expires has been cancelled.</p>
<p>The Great Stage will be closed for three days from last night to tomorrow. It is said that this is in response to the request of Tan Xiaopei and Fu Ying's father and son to take a break and recuperate, and they will successively reveal and perform various famous plays. It is said that "The Complete Lianying Village One" is approved to be performed in advance.</p>
<p>The third series of "That's Me" at the Gong Stage has been rehearsed, and it is still based on scientific props and scenery. It is approved to open on the 28th night.</p>
<p>Zhao Manyun's affiliation and performance with Gengxin is very strong, so the troupe has requested to arrange and sing "New Cotton Spinning." Jin Yu sings her tune, and various songs are mixed. According to Manyun, the performance has to wait a little longer, but she is confident that she will definitely not let Wu Suqiu and Liang Xiaoluan monopolize the beauty in front of her.</p>
<h3>Charity Concert</h3>
<p>The charity music concert was held at the Lyceum Theatre last night. The scene was grand, the program was wonderful, and the audience sighed in admiration. It will continue to be held at the Lyceum tonight. Those who want to listen to elegant music can go to Mou Deli and the Lyceum to pre-purchase tickets. Doing good and entertainment, kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain in Qiong Garden</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Vowing to Sweep Away the Xiongnu Regardless of Personal Safety</p>
<p>Li Di said, "In terms of the number of soldiers, we are outnumbered, so they will retreat to the strategic location of Shanhaiguan, and then they can rely on it for both advance and retreat. Therefore, our troops and Wu Sangui's troops will inevitably come into contact there." Liu Zongmin said, "According to the villagers, the government troops have not retreated far. Why don't we chase after them closely and not let them get their wish?" Li Yan said, "Pursuing them too closely may lead to an ambush." Liu Zongmin laughed and said, "Since leaving Tongguan, we have been victorious in every battle and invincible in every attack, only suffering a slight setback at Ningwu Pass. However, Zhou Yuji eventually died in our hands. Wu Sangui is just a young brat. Why should we worry so much? If you don't chase, my left-wing army will chase alone." Li Yan said, "Then please lead the front team, and I will be the rear team. In case of an ambush, I can respond and prevent us from being completely surrounded." Liu Zongmin said, "We have many soldiers and horses, so why fear being surrounded! Even if there is an ambush, I can defeat it. This method is also good. I am naturally willing to lead the front team, and you will respond later." So Liu Zongmin led his subordinates, the bandits, to immediately cross the Luan River and chase forward. Who knew that when they chased to the vicinity of the pine forest, they suddenly heard a signal cannon sound from the forest in front, and a team of government soldiers rushed out and blocked their way. Liu Zongmin took a look at the front and saw that the number of government troops was not large and not well-organized. He taught his subordinates not to worry and just charge forward, and sure enough, they dispersed with one rush. Liu Zongmin laughed and said, "Is this kind of useless government army considered an ambush? Not enough for me to kill." Advancing further, the front was a mountain pass. Liu Zongmin led the troops through first, and again heard a signal cannon sound in the valley. (197)</p>
