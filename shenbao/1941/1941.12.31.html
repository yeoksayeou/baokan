<h3>嚴密調查工廠用量確保今後煤斤供應存底見減應力求撙節華北煤斤將運滬補充</h3>
<p>工部局煤斤管理委員會從昨起之一週後、即可確悉公共租界現存煤斤及此間所需煤斤之確數、而後乃能擬定確切計劃、並開始磋商、以確保上海日後仍有煤斤供應、工部局登記存煤、以數週為期、</p>
<p>一般調查亙一星期</p>
<p>故欲知存謀確數、並非易事、蓋一家工廠若於兩週前登記存煤若十、同時並已消耗其中之一部份、共他登記存煤者、情况亦然也、工部局現派大批調查員、以已日為期、分赴各登記之工廠、對各廠現存之煤斤、作一般之調查、預料至星期六、工部局即可知界內現存煤斤之確數、局力煤斤調査員同時嚴密查詢各　工廠以目下之生產為根據、究需若干煤斤與原料、調查結果、可望確悉何種工業存有較其實在所需者為多之煤斤、及何處工廠現雖停工而仍有煤斤存底、</p>
<p>搬運憑證儘量少發</p>
<p>工部局對於工業煤斤調査竣事後、將於下週初、嚴密調査各煤商與私人對於煤斤之實在需用與貯積量、此項工作、可望於下週三完成、工部局煤斤管理委員會現儘可能範圍、少發運煤許可證、以期保持最多之煤斤存底、就工業而言、運煤之許可、僅以每週確實所需額為根據、對於藉取暖等家用之煤、概减其半、</p>
<p>三週以來未獲接濟</p>
<p>査太平洋戰事爆發後三週來，上海所耗之煤、均係業巳運到之存底其總額當然已因而大减、蓋三週來、各處均無煤斤運到上海接濟也、一般人相信、日當局不久將以華北與華中之煤供給上海、交工部局之煤斤管理委員會負責分配、</p>
<h3>元旦日加緊防務</h3>
<p>明日為民國三十一年元旦、本巿各業均循例休假、公共和界汝法租界　務當局、為確保界內治安及秩序起見、特施行緊急戒備三天、屆時除各要道加派探捕駐守及巡邏外、並將在公共娛樂塲所加緊防務、至巿區方面、亦將臨時特別戒備、</p>
<h3>今日出棧米麵較多　專供年節需要　羅斯福堆棧今日啓封　麵粉准提取一週用量</h3>
<p>工部局糊食管理委員會、指定出米堆棧巳有信源·茂泰·太古·隆茂·中國·五處、次第啓封、供各米店搬取、以應門售、羅斯福堆棧、亦定今日啓封、昨日米糧辦事處、簽發若干家米號、指定由羅斯福堆棧出米、至太古隆茂中國三處堆棧、今日亦照常開啓、供米號提取、今日向上列四處搬取洋米、有四千餘包、</p>
<p>銀錢客戶催報存糧</p>
<p>銀錢業經營倉庫、所存客戶之米糧、工部局亦巳通知該業、非憑工部局之准運證、不得移動、並須由各銀行錢莊、將客家戶名地址數量、抄送該局、以憑撥派各米號、以供需糶、聞是項倉庫中存米頗豐、足以調　本埠民食、</p>
<p>麵粉續出三千餘包</p>
<p>工部局麵粉辦事處對麵粉之申請、已於前（二十九）日如期截止、現除派員調査申請者之實際需要量外、並已絡續簽發搬運證、指定由福新二廠福新七廠及阜豐廠三處提取、昨日簽發搬運證、可於今日提取麵粉、總數達三千餘包、足供切麵餅饅麵包等各業一星一期需要、又悉米糧及麵粉兩辦事處、新年一至二日放假、一月三日起恢復辦公、</p>

<h3>日軍發表緊急佈吿</h3>
<p>上海方面日陸海軍最高指揮官為保護市民緊急佈吿云，　如有人對於良善無辜市民之身體生命財產加以不正當侵害時、不論其國籍如何、日本軍對於加害者當加以嚴重處罰、絕無旁貸、　如有人感覺其身體生命財產被人不正當侵害時、（例如被人不法逮捕押收物件威脅恐嚇等事、）不論侵害者係假借日本軍名義與否、即行報告日本軍民事問訊處、　日本軍對於犯罪嫌欵者之拘押、於能證明無犯罪事實時、始予開釋、倘利用納賄等情、概小生效、如有人以解除拘押為藉口、對於犯罪嫌疑者或其家屬及有關係人勒索賄賂者、不拘何人、當科以極刑、　如有人被勒索賄賂時、應即向日本軍民事問訊處報吿之、　日本軍民事問訊處設立於共同租界江西路一七〇號漢彌敦大樓（電話一三一八三——四）、對於日本軍民事問訊處之前　及　之報吿、上海憲兵隊本部（崇明路八號）亦可受理之</p>
<h3>維持交通新利器　木炭發動機　汽車與卡車均可改裝</h3>
<p>因汽油匱乏、公私汽車除絕對必要者外、均已停駛、車主乃多以公共車輛與自由車代步、惟現有亞洲機器鐵廠者、可將搭客汽車與遝貨卡軍改裝木炭發動機、以代汽油行駛、該廠主鮑曼談稱</p>
<p>時至今日殊可提倡</p>
<p>往年燃木炭以代汽油之法、未能在上海運輸界佔一席地、時至今日、則於木炭與汽油間、巳無選擇餘地、渠曾在北方改裝木炭汽車、頗有經騐、如日本國內、對木炭汽車、已廣泛使用、一九三五年間、曾有若干技師、試造木炭發動機、因弊多於利、致在六閱月內被迫停止工作、今因情勢使然、已不容苛擇矣、鮑氏並否認汽車改燃木炭耗費、而平時費用、昂於暗盤汽油價之說、據稱、木炭乃土產、價較低廉、</p>
<p>每車改裝費七千元</p>
<p>搭客汽車改裝木炭發動機、約費七千元、而從虹橋駛至外灘、所費約為十元八角、表面觀之、此數似頗昂貴、然對於必須以汽車代步者、此　猶不為貴、如珠寳商不便携貨步行或搭公共車輛、醫生與老者則不便駕自由車、如改乘木炭汽車、則所獲安全與便利、殊足抵償所費、該廠加速工作、每月能改裝汽車約五十輛、惟因種種關係、不能從事大量之改裝云、</p>
<p>新年期內車行時間</p>
<p>公共租界公共汽車從晨七時半出廠至夜六時停駛之現行時間、巳稍有伸縮性、卽晨七時半前與夜六時後、亦有數輛公共汽車行駛是、惟此額外行駛時間、不出半小時、此種辦法、係耶誕前夕起實行至今、今日仍將如是、目下並無變更之微象、至於謠傳公共汽車行駛時間、將於新年開始復受限制一節、因車行時間均於前一天排定、故須今日分曉、</p>
<p>汽車胎輪廢物利用</p>
<p>自汽油來源斷絕、滬埠存油又吿罄後、本埠各出差汽車公　及私人汽車、乃紛紛停駛、置之高閣、若干車主、更因空車佔地甚多、無法置放、故煞費苦心、茲悉有一部份汽車公司、已將擱置之車輛卸下、製成場車、俾廢物利用、藉以運輸貨物、</p>
<h3>靑年會施散冬衣</h3>
<p>上海靑年會鑒於近來天　寒冷、受凍貧民及苦兒　多、街頭瑟瑟、至為可憫、此數月來、曾經各方捐助、該會特製冬衣數千件、分區散放、聞其辦法甚為周到、該會係於事前向各地實際調査、先給衣券、定於陽曆元旦上午九時至十二時、憑券發衣、其領衣處計分、一勞神父路慕爾堂分堂、二文堅師路克能海路口重實小學、三武定路武足小學、四金神父路辣斐德路新運小學、五勞勃生路靑年會滬西公社、六八仙橋靑年會、七四川路靑年會等七處、此外由該會贈送下述數處代發者為、界路紹興七縣同鄕會、南巿中華　徒慈善救濟會、同仁醫　、南門普益　等處、凡持有衣券者、可向就近領衣處取衣、該會救濟寒黎、不惜苦心計劃功歸實際、嘉惠實多、</p>
<h3>不擬續駛之車輛各種照會應繳還</h3>
<p>工部局昨發布告、通知各汽車與機器脚踏車主以及各種自動車輛車夫、自明日起、向巡捕房車務處執照間換領明年度開車執照、茲據探悉、各商用與私人汽車之擬於明年停駛、或其車主不擬向工部局捐納明年度汽車執照捐者、應即以各車照會脾退還工部局、而各停駛車輛之車夫或不擬捐納明年度開車執照捐之車夫、亦應將其開車執照退還工部局、若此等執照不退還、則明年度執照捐仍須照付云、得特別許可而繼續行駛之各汽車、雖其所領行駛許可證為期僅一月、而各車主仍須捐納至少半年之全部汽車執照捐、惟若此等車輛之行駛許可證不再展長其有效期限、或車主願將執照退還時、各車主仍有權取回其汽車執照捐之一部份、</p>
<p>汽車執照一律通用</p>
<p>工部局公吿「査關於經本局法租界公董局或上海特別市政府所發之私人汽車執照、得在公共租界法租界與巿政府轄境內一律通用一事、業經洽商就緒、自明年一月一日起、凡在滬西界外區域內夜間停放於汽車間或停留過夜之私人汽車、應改向巿政府公用局請領執照、但為便利各該汽車之車主起見、明年度上半年之執照、經商定由市政府派員在江西路二〇九號本局總辦公處捐稅股辦理簽發事宜、各有關係之車主、應在明年一月六日以後、儘速請領市政府之執照、一面繳還本局所發之執照牌、茲為避免因開駛汽車前來本局以致耗費汽油起見、不擬將車輛重新過磅、關於車輛之必要情形、當由本局之紀錄供給之、至於滬西界外區域內之住戶及其車夫、領有本局與公董局所發之開車執照者、可勿另向市政府請領新開車執照、但應向市政府請求換發明年度及往後之開車執照、每年一次、此項執照之換發、亦由市政府派員在本局捐稅股辦理、其有已向本局換領明年度開車執照者、應即送請中央捕房車務處予以註銷、並請求發還已付照費、」</p>

<h3>正視失業的狂瀾</h3>
<p>— 林峰</p>
<p>失業問題在今天的上海已經成了狂瀾。這狂瀾，在上海的歷史上是空前的；因為其所牽累到的部門和人羣實在是太多了。到現在為止，我們巳看到這些部門的人羣已經遭受到失業的厄運：</p>
<p>首先是每天奔跑在黃浦灘的碼頭工人，進出口的輪船一停，他們也就無工可做：其次是英美荷等商在上海開設的洋行里的行員，其數量也實在可觀；由於汽油的統制，許多出差汽車夫，卡車夫，也就無油可開；因着鋼鐵原料的小易採購，大批五金鐵廠巳相繼解散；特別是為了貨物實銷的停止，許多紗廠等等也都先後停工……假使要做一個估計的話，那末其人數大概在三四十萬之間。</p>
<p>毫無疑問，道問題巳成為每個上海市民所關心的問題。</p>
<p>看淸了環境，才能够決定處置的方法，大概說起來，上海的畸形繁榮已經走到了盡頭，現在是開始拋物般的急速的向下墮降——這簡直是不能够阻住的墮降，現在所能為力的，就是怎樣來减弱這墮降的速度，也就是怎樣來保持一分元氣。</p>
<p>我認為這幾點是應該予以注意的：</p>
<p>第一，許多廠商雖然碰到了一些經濟上的困難，但大致上說，一時是不至於虧本的，因之，能够維持下夫的還應該維持下去，不然的話，先來考慮緊縮，因為每個人都希望上海市面有一天會興旺起來，所以，現在能够在經濟上和技術上保持一分尤氣的，將來當可駕輕就熟了。</p>
<p>第二，如不得巳像因汽油限制而解散的，那末在解散時應該給予必要的相當時日的生活費用，而不使其即流為餓殍，成了凍死骨。（編者按：祥生，雲飛，銀色，三公司均已發遣散費）</p>
<p>第三，最重要的還是努力於物價的抑平，不然的話，上海將成了一個不可思議的地方，像這般沒有雇主的碼頭工人，旣不能領得什麼遣散費，又不能得社會卜的救濟，不但如西報所云，其將成為「上海社會之負担」，並且是上海社會不安哩！</p>
<h3>來者猶可追</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>光陰迅速，案頸的日歷又翻到最後的一頁了。在時間上是經過了）年，在人生的行程上，是又到了一個站頭，計往瞻前，在這作為一個段落的大除夕，不是結一結賬，便得計劃一下明年的預算表。</p>
<p>今年這一年，無論是商家或個人，都遇到空　未有的一頁，盈虧利潤，在十三擋算盤珠上或許還不能作準確的統計，但是事實上即是一分一厘之差，也是有案司稽的。譬如投機商人的壟斷操縱，地產事業的突飛猛晋，娛樂塲所的畸形發展，在沒有結賬的前，果然是使人目眩五色，到今天晚上，各個主角的心理算盤，一定有着一個可觀的盈虧之數，至於個人，大都是無法把去年開下的支票兌現（大概支票的數目太大了），在慚愧之餘，祇要出入有限，也可算倖運之至了。</p>
<p>但是我們不能對於前途沒有希望，做賣買而虧本，祇是戰術的錯誤；所做的事業沒有意義，也是時之糊塗。所謂來者猶可追，在今年的賬簿合攏之前，姑不必去問盈虧利潤，就要想一想過去的錯誤而設法彌柿之，那末從明天開始，或者就生意興隆通四海，財源茂盛達三內的一年</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十六　靑春之火</p>
<p>讀者對於本書中的另一主角，－羅湘綺－大槪總還沒有忘記吧？</p>
<p>十七年前，她是在風狂雨驟一樣的情勢下，跟她情人和女兒分離的；當時，她委實不準備再活下去，但袁寶潘　不讓她死，甚至忘掉了做人應有的羞恥向她說：</p>
<p>「從前的事，譬如沒有一樣，祗要你不記我的仇，我還一樣的待你！」</p>
<p>後來袁紹文又偷偷地安慰了她一番，吿訴她秋海棠並沒有死，只僅僅受了一些輕傷，並且巳逃到南方去了。湘綺雖不敢問他梅寳怎麽樣，可是她想秋海棠旣能逃走，當然是決不會把梅寳丟下的，這樣她的心裏才略略安慰了一些。祗是不久，她又聽說紹文突然用手鎗打死了季兆雄，袁家別的人都以為是季兆雄性氣不好，挺撞了七爺的緣故；但湘綺却非常懷疑，她祖憂秋海棠父女倆已給季兆雄一齊害死了，所以紹文要打死他，替朋友報仇。然而困難的是湘綺自己無法出去打聽，自從袁寳藩把她帶回北平以後，雖然並沒有軟禁他，但行動已非常的不便，每次出去，總有二姨太伴着她，或是袁寳藩自己跟她一路走，使她永遠沒有機曾分出身子去，我尋趙玉崑以汝秋海棠許多別的同行。</p>
<p>那幾年的日子眞是很小容易挨過去的，她像一個失去了魂靈的人一樣，每年隨着大衆起身，吃飯，穿衣，睡覺；有時候連自己也不知道今天的天氣是冷還是暖。</p>
<p>她父親和哥哥那邊倒時常還有信來，也祇有在她接到他們來信的時候，心裏還覺得有幾分暖意，特別是父親來信上所說的哥哥的身體巳完全康復，在上海開一家小綢莊，生章十分順手的幾句話，使她覺得最高興。（二九二）</p>
<h3>一元五角四分</h3>
<p>— 宜尼</p>
<p>風括着，雨打着，雪飄着，行人道上的空氣够蕭殺凄凉了，連黃包車夫也暫時放下車槓子，揉着雙手，走進熱氣沸騰的小飯館。</p>
<p>正是吃夜飯的時候，小飯館中的堂倌，拉直着嗓子，高喊「血湯，豆腐……或者「洋先生（指穿西裝朋友）會賬二元〇五分。」</p>
<p>一陣喧喊，突然一個穿灰布袍的朋友被堂倌打了一拳又一脚，這位朋友悶聲不響地，却抱着頭的溜了出去，大家都集中目光注意這一位被打的朋友，不過因為各掃門前雪，沒有一個去打抱不平的。</p>
<p>後來從一位好閒者去問這一個狠得很的堂倌的對口」中，聽到這一句話：</p>
<p>「他媽的，看看倒像樣，連一元五角四分都付不出，白吃三碗白飯鹹肉三塊，這種像伙不打打誰？」</p>
<p>一元五角四分，代價是一拳又一脚，大家都低下頭，嘆了一口長氣。</p>

<h3>一年來藝壇大事記（下）</h3>
<p>— 景毅</p>
<p>話劇方面：</p>
<p>（甲）話劇運動的進展這一年來，話劇運動是無時不在邁步進展中，在去年，全市尙僅有「上海劇藝社」璇宮劇院等一兩家正式劇塲，但由於一般觀衆的迫切需要，今年先後產生了好幾家，他們對於取材佈置服裝道具等，也無時不在愼重精密的考慮之下，漸臻於盡善盡美之境，就像專演文明戲的「綠寳」「東方」等劇塲，也為了避免觀衆的淘汰而步入了正軌，他們近來一樣也有很多有意義的作品給我們看到，這確是今年劇壇的一個好現象，而値得予以歌功頌德的。</p>
<p>（乙）業餘劇社的崛起　由於職業劇團的發展，跟着業餘劇社也被一部份影人和愛好戲劇的靑年男女紛紛組織起來，先後統計不下三四十個之多，差不多每星期有他們在各處輪流假康公演，佔據了劇壇的一方面，至於演出的一般成績，有很多也不輸於職業劇團，不過因為他們並不以此為業的緣故，往往公演一兩次後，　花一現，耶吿消滅於無形的，正不在少數呢。</p>
<p>（丙）兩大劇團的解散在這一年的最後一月中，劇壇上却發生了一個不幸的變故，那便是由於一二·八局勢的影響本市擁有最大號召力的「上海職業劇團」和「上海劇藝社」却先後解散了。上海話劇得能進展到今日的地步，我們不能否認大部是歸功於該兩劇團同人的努力，這一個突然的損失，在愛好話劇的觀衆，是深深為此惋惜的。</p>
<h3>藝壇近事錄</h3>

<p>上海戲劇學校巳與更新舞台訂約，國曆元旦起改在該台日塲演出，由關鴻賓任後台主任，該校新排之「虹橋贈珠」「獅子樓」等劇，亦排定在新年中次第演出。</p>
<p>本欄前戰大同演員龔稼農徬徨岐途，茲悉龔早於月初由費穆介紹，加入民華工作，新片「國色天香」中，耶被派担任軍要角色。</p>
<p>傳說國聯第二部卡通長片「蜜蜂皇后」巳吿流產，因該片全部費用估計約需四十萬元之鉅，當局決定卡通科停止工作，該科全部學員亦已解散。</p>
<h3>亞洲影院公司輪流放映制</h3>
<p>亞洲影院公司所屬第一輪影院，美琪，大光明，南京，國泰四家，自明年元旦起，所映影片，採用輪流放映制，譬如南京元且起獻映桃樂姍拉摩主演之五彩巨片「美人魚」，至四號則改由大光明獻映，大光明獻映至七號止，八號起由國泰獻映，至十一號則輪由美琪接映。如此輪流換映，不僅調劑觀衆口胃，並得减少因交通不便而起之麻煩，蓋觀衆均可向就近之影院購票觀影也。</p>

<p>Sweden Capital, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic correspondent Lennox wrote in the newspaper yesterday, commenting on Eden's talks in Moscow, that because the Soviet Union is fighting hard in the war against Germany, the Soviet Union will certainly demand an important position at future peace conferences. Other newspapers also have the same view, generally believing that Stalin will make extremely broad demands, which may include the internal affairs of China, the Middle East, and Western European countries. London political figures believe that military experts in Moscow must be discussing Germany's planned offensive in the coming spring. Stalin and Eden must have studied the countermeasures to be taken if Germany launches simultaneous attacks in Ukraine and Turkey. In this regard, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Turkey must maintain close cooperation and plan necessary measures to protect the Caucasus, the Caspian Sea, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Egypt. For this reason, the British Ambassador to Turkey and the Minister to Iran have also attended the meeting in Moscow at Eden's invitation. Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Litvinov also provided Moscow with information from the Washington conference during the Moscow meeting. Some political figures in London believe that the United Kingdom will not ask the Soviet Union to declare war on Japan in the Moscow meeting.</p>

This faction is gaining momentum in Argentina.</p>

<p>Somewhere in Jiangsu - The military and political authorities here regard the new county system as an important policy. Various provinces have successively implemented it. Although Jiangsu Province has applied for a temporary postponement due to special circumstances, with military plans developing according to the clock, political preparations must also be made in coordination and promotion. It has been decided to separately establish new county system experimental zones in order to gain practical experience and insights to serve as a model for widespread implementation. Huai'an, Shiying, Yancheng, and Funing counties have been designated as the first experimental zone, and a supervisory committee has been established with Wang Ziyu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, as the chairman, along with 18 to 23 senior party and government officials from this province as members, responsible for supervising and guiding the experimental work.

<h3>Chongqing Municipality Strictly Prohibits Banquets</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Supreme National Defense Council issued measures in April last year to ban banquets for party, government, and military personnel, which somewhat curbed the trend of excessive drinking and dining. However, after a long period of implementation, it has inevitably become lax. Therefore, a special ban has been reissued, revising the provisions to be more stringent than before. Except for receptions for foreign guests and official banquets, all banquets of a routine social nature are prohibited. Festive celebrations should be limited to tea and snacks. (30th)</p>

<h3>Scenery of the Philippines</h3>
<p>The Philippine Islands are located in the tropics, north of the equator, and comprise over 7,000 islands of various sizes.  The eastern coast is interrupted by mountain ranges, lacking winding bays and containing many reefs, so there are no major cities or towns along the east coast.  The islands to the southwest and nearby have good harbors capable of accommodating large ships, so large commercial ports have been built.  The Philippines have seen rapid progress in modern construction.  The iron bridge in the "upper picture" is located in Baguio, a summer resort, and is a structure connecting two mountains, making the engineering extraordinarily large. The "lower picture" shows a native dance of the Philippines.</p>

<h3>Strict Investigation of Factory Coal Consumption to Ensure Future Supply, Conservation Urged, North China Coal to be Shipped to Shanghai as Supplement</h3>
<p>The Coal Management Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) will be able to accurately determine the current coal reserves in the International Settlement and the exact amount of coal needed here after one week from yesterday. Afterwards, it will be able to formulate concrete plans and begin consultations to ensure that Shanghai has a coal supply in the future. The SMC registers coal reserves for a period of several weeks.</p>
<p>General Investigation Takes a Week</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not easy to know the exact number of reserves.  If a factory registered ten units of coal two weeks ago, it would have already consumed part of it.  The situation is similar for other coal registrants.  The SMC is now dispatching a large number of investigators, with a deadline of today, to conduct a general investigation of the existing coal reserves of each registered factory.  It is expected that by Saturday, the SMC will know the exact number of coal reserves within the Settlement. At the same time, the SMC coal investigators are closely examining the coal needs of each factory based on its current production.  The results of the investigation are expected to determine which industries have more coal than they actually need, and which factories have coal reserves even though they are currently shut down.</p>
<p>Issuing as Few Transport Permits as Possible</p>
<p>After the SMC completes the investigation of industrial coal, it will strictly investigate the actual needs and reserves of coal merchants and private individuals at the beginning of next week.  This work is expected to be completed by Wednesday of next week. The SMC Coal Management Committee is now issuing as few coal transport permits as possible, in order to maintain the maximum coal reserves. As far as industry is concerned, coal transport permits are based only on the actual weekly needs.  Coal for household use, such as for heating, is generally reduced by half.</p>
<p>No Supply for Three Weeks</p>
<p>It has been found that in the three weeks since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the coal consumed in Shanghai has been from existing stocks that had already been transported, and the total amount has of course been greatly reduced.  For three weeks, no coal has been transported to Shanghai from elsewhere as a supplement. It is generally believed that the Japanese authorities will soon supply Shanghai with coal from North and Central China, and the SMC Coal Management Committee will be responsible for distribution.</p>
<h3>Increased Security on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is New Year's Day of the 31st year of the Republic of China. All businesses in the city will be closed as usual. The Public and French Concession authorities, in order to ensure public safety and order within the Concessions, have implemented a three-day state of emergency. At that time, in addition to increasing the number of detectives stationed and patrolling at key intersections, security will also be stepped up in public entertainment venues. There will also be special temporary precautions in the city.</p>
<h3>More Rice and Flour Leaving Warehouses Today, Specifically for New Year's Needs, Roosevelt Warehouse Opens Today, Flour Withdrawal Permitted for One Week's Consumption</h3>
<p>The SMC Food Management Committee has designated five rice warehouses—Sin Yuan, Mow Tai, Taikoo, Long Mow, and China—to be opened in sequence for rice shops to take delivery to meet retail sales. The Roosevelt Warehouse will also be opened today. Yesterday, the Rice and Grain Office issued instructions to several rice shops, designating them to withdraw rice from the Roosevelt Warehouse. The Taikoo, Long Mow, and China warehouses will also be open as usual today for rice shops to withdraw. Today, more than 4,000 bags of foreign rice are being withdrawn from the above four locations.</p>
<p>Urging Silver and Money Clients to Report Grain Reserves</p>
<p>The SMC has also notified the silver and money industry, which operates warehouses, that it cannot move the rice and grain stored by customers without a permit from the SMC. Each bank and money shop must also copy the customer's name, address, and quantity, and send it to the SMC for allocation to various rice shops to meet demand. It is said that the rice stored in these warehouses is quite abundant and sufficient to regulate the food supply of this port.</p>
<p>Continued Release of More Than Three Thousand Bags of Flour</p>
<p>The deadline for applications for flour from the SMC Flour Office was met as scheduled on the 29th. In addition to dispatching personnel to investigate the actual needs of applicants, transport permits have been issued continuously, designating withdrawal from the Fuxin No. 2 Factory, Fuxin No. 7 Factory, and Fufeng Factory. Transport permits were issued yesterday, and a total of more than 3,000 bags of flour can be withdrawn today, sufficient to meet the needs of noodle makers, biscuit makers, steamed bun makers, bread makers, and other industries for one week. In addition, it is learned that both the Rice and Grain Office and the Flour Office will be closed for the New Year on the 1st and 2nd of January, and will resume operations on January 3rd.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Balance to be Returned Soon</p>
<p>Previously, rice shops in this city were selling foreign rice from the British companies Lekiang and Mow Tai on behalf of the SMC. At that time, in order to facilitate matters, all rice payments were made in whole numbers. It is now learned that the SMC, in order to consider the hardships of merchants, began to return the balance from the front. After the 8th of this month, the balance will be returned to a total of 418 rice shops that sold foreign rice, totaling more than 550,000 Legal Tender. All rice shops that have not yet received their balance can bring their weight tickets to the SMC office at No. 703 starting today to complete the procedures and transfer to the general ledger room for payment. It is reported that the rice shops have successively received notices from the SMC in recent days.</p>
<p>SMC Rice Payment Method</p>
<p>From now until further notice, those who purchase rice from the SMC must pay the payment in cash, approved cash checks, or cashier's checks issued by approved banks.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Issues Emergency Notice</h3>
<p>The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai has issued an emergency notice to protect the citizens, saying: If anyone improperly infringes on the body, life, or property of good and innocent citizens, regardless of their nationality, the Japanese army will severely punish the perpetrator without any hesitation. If anyone feels that their body, life, or property has been improperly infringed upon (such as being unlawfully arrested, confiscated, threatened, or intimidated), regardless of whether the perpetrator is impersonating the Japanese army, they should immediately report it to the Japanese Military Civil Affairs Inquiry Office. The Japanese army will only release those suspected of crimes when they can prove that they have not committed any crimes. If bribery is used, it will not be effective. If anyone uses the pretext of releasing someone from custody to extort bribes from the criminal suspect or their family and related persons, no matter who they are, they will be severely punished. If anyone is being extorted for bribes, they should immediately report it to the Japanese Military Civil Affairs Inquiry Office. The Japanese Military Civil Affairs Inquiry Office is located at the Hamilton Building, No. 170 Jiangxi Road, International Settlement (telephone 13183-4). Reports to the Japanese Military Civil Affairs Inquiry Office can also be accepted by the Shanghai Military Police Headquarters (No. 8 Chongming Road).</p>
<h3>New Tool to Maintain Traffic, Charcoal Engine, Cars and Trucks Can Be Modified</h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of gasoline, private and public cars have been suspended, except for those that are absolutely necessary.  Car owners are mostly using public transportation and rickshaws instead. However, Asia Machinery Iron Works can modify passenger cars and freight trucks into charcoal engines to replace gasoline.  The factory owner, Mr. Bowman, said:</p>
<p>It is Especially Worth Promoting Today</p>
<p>In previous years, the method of using charcoal instead of gasoline has not been able to gain a foothold in Shanghai's transportation industry. Today, there is no choice between charcoal and gasoline. He has experience in modifying charcoal cars in the north. In Japan, charcoal cars are widely used. Around 1935, several technicians tried to build charcoal engines, but because the disadvantages outweighed the advantages, they were forced to stop working within six months. Now, due to the situation, it is no longer possible to be picky. Mr. Bowman also denied the saying that it costs a lot to modify cars to burn charcoal, and that the usual cost is higher than the black market price of gasoline. It is said that charcoal is a local product and the price is relatively low.</p>
<p>Modification Fee is Seven Thousand Yuan Per Car</p>
<p>It costs about 7,000 yuan to modify a passenger car to a charcoal engine, and it costs about 10.8 yuan to drive from Hongqiao to the Bund. On the surface, this number seems quite expensive, but for those who must use a car, this is still not expensive. For example, jewelers find it inconvenient to carry goods on foot or by public transport, and doctors and the elderly find it inconvenient to drive rickshaws. If they switch to charcoal cars, the safety and convenience they gain will be more than enough to offset the cost. The factory is speeding up its work and can modify about 50 cars per month, but due to various reasons, it cannot engage in large-scale modification.</p>
<p>New Year Schedule of Car Service</p>
<p>The current hours of operation for public buses in the International Settlement, from 7:30 AM to 6:00 PM, have been slightly adjusted. Namely, there are also several public buses running before 7:30 AM and after 6:00 PM. However, this extra operating time is no more than half an hour. This method has been implemented since Christmas Eve and will continue to be so today. There is no indication of any change at the moment. As for the rumors that the hours of operation for public buses will be restricted again at the beginning of the New Year, the bus schedules are set the day before, so it will be clear today.</p>
<p>Recycling Car Tires</p>
<p>Since the source of gasoline has been cut off and the oil reserves in Shanghai have been exhausted, the car companies and private cars in this port have stopped running and are placed on the shelf. Some car owners have had to spend a lot of effort because the empty cars take up a lot of space and cannot be placed. It is now learned that some car companies have unloaded the vehicles that have been put aside and made them into field cars for transporting goods by recycling.</p>
<h3>YMCA Distributes Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has observed that the weather has been cold recently, and there are many poor people and orphans who are freezing and shivering on the streets, which is very pitiful. In recent months, it has received donations from various parties. The YMCA has specially made thousands of pieces of winter clothing and distributed them by district. It is said that the method is very thoughtful. The YMCA conducted actual surveys in various places in advance, first issued clothing vouchers, and scheduled to issue clothing by voucher from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on New Year's Day. The clothing distribution points are: 1. Father Laborie's Branch of the Muer Church, 2. Chongshi Elementary School at the intersection of Wen Jian Shi Road and Kenenghai Road, 3. Wuzu Elementary School on Wuding Road, 4. Xinyun Elementary School on Jin Shen Fu Road and Route Lafayette, 5. YMCA Shanghai West Community on Robertson Road, 6. Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, 7. Sichuan Road YMCA. In addition, the following locations are given by the YMCA to distribute on its behalf: Jie Road Shaoxing Seven Counties Association, Nanshi China Christian Charity Relief Association, Tongren Hospital, and Nanmen Puyi Church. Anyone holding a clothing voucher can pick up clothing at the nearest clothing distribution point. The YMCA is doing its best to help the poor, and its efforts are yielding practical results, benefiting many.</p>
<h3>Various Documents for Vehicles Not Intended to be Driven Should be Returned</h3>
<p>The SMC issued a notice yesterday, notifying car and motorcycle owners and drivers of various motor vehicles to exchange their driving licenses for the next year's driving license at the Licensing Department of the Police Station from tomorrow. According to information, commercial and private cars that are planned to be suspended next year, or whose owners do not intend to donate the next year's car license fee to the SMC, should return the car documents to the SMC. Drivers of vehicles that are suspended or drivers who do not intend to donate the next year's driving license fee should also return their driving licenses to the SMC. If these licenses are not returned, the next year's license fee will still be paid. Each car that is granted a special permit to continue driving, even if its driving permit is only valid for one month, the car owner must still donate the full car license fee for at least half a year. However, if the driving permit of these vehicles is no longer extended or the car owner is willing to return the license, the car owner still has the right to take back a portion of the car license fee.</p>
<p>Car Licenses are Universal</p>
<p>The SMC announced, "It has been agreed that private car licenses issued by this Bureau, the French Concession Public Works Bureau, or the Shanghai Special Municipal Government may be used universally within the jurisdiction of the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the Municipal Government. Starting from January 1st of next year, private cars parked or staying overnight in garages in the areas outside the Shanghai Western boundary should apply for licenses from the Municipal Government Public Utilities Bureau. However, for the convenience of the owners of these cars, it has been agreed that the licenses for the first half of next year will be issued by the Municipal Government at the Tax Collection Division of this Bureau's General Office at No. 209 Jiangxi Road. Car owners should apply for the Municipal Government's license as soon as possible after January 6th of next year and return the license plate issued by this Bureau. In order to avoid the waste of gasoline caused by driving the vehicles to this Bureau, the vehicles will not be reweighed. The necessary information about the vehicles will be provided by this Bureau's records. As for the residents and their drivers in the areas outside the Shanghai Western boundary who have obtained driving licenses issued by this Bureau and the French Concession Public Works Bureau, they do not need to apply for a new driving license from the Municipal Government, but should apply to the Municipal Government for a replacement driving license for the next year and subsequent years, once a year. The replacement of this license will also be handled by the Municipal Government at the Tax Collection Division of this Bureau. Those who have already exchanged for the next year's driving license from this Bureau should immediately send it to the Central Police Station Vehicle Administration Office for cancellation and request the refund of the fee paid."</p>
<h3>British Ships from the Yangtze River are Towed to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The British Yangtze River liners that were moored after the Shanghai war include the Taikoo Company's Wenzhou ship, moored in Jiujiang; the Wuhu, Wusong, and Changsha ships, moored in Hankou; and the Shashi and Xiangtan ships, originally moored in Yichang. After the Japanese army occupied the area last autumn, the two ships sailed downstream and also moored in Hankou. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. has the Baohe, Longhe, and Jihe ships, all moored in Hankou. There are a total of nine British ships moored on the Yangtze River. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, all of the above ships have been taken over by the Japanese Navy. The Baohe ship was towed to Shanghai on the 23rd of this month, and the Longhe ship also arrived in Shanghai from Hankou on the morning of the 29th. The two ships are now moored on the Yangshupu riverfront. The remaining ships will also be towed to Shanghai one after another in the near future.</p>
<h3>Customs to Close on New Year's Day, Ship Entries and Exits to Cease</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the new year, and the Jianghai Customs will be closed. The reporting of goods will be suspended. Therefore, ships traveling to the Yangtze River and near-sea ports will cease after customs closure. From the next day, Jianghai Customs will resume operations, and ships will enter and exit as usual.</p>

<h3>Nearly 30,000 Corpses Exposed This Year, Alarming Rate of Child Mortality, Hope to Establish a Poor Children's Hospital</h3>
<p>Since the weather turned cold, the number of corpses exposed on the streets has increased sharply. On the night of the 28th, a total of 236 people were frozen to death on the roadside in the two concessions and collected by various charities, setting a new record since the beginning of winter. The mortality rate of the poor in the French Concession averages about 23 adults and 48 children per day. On the 29th, there were 62 adult corpses and 59 child corpses in the Public Concession. According to the Pushan Villa report, a total of 29,440 corpses have been collected this year, of which 20,720 were children, indicating the alarming rate of child mortality in this port. Most of the child corpses were abandoned on the roadside because their parents were unable to afford a funeral. Some sick children are abandoned even before they die because their parents cannot afford medical treatment. They are then exposed to the cold and die. By the time the corpse collection vehicle arrives, there is no hope of survival. Therefore, the staff urgently hope that the SMC will take appropriate relief measures, especially the establishment of a poor children's hospital, which is the most important task at present. There are very few hospitals of this charitable nature in Shanghai. If one can be established, it can save countless poor children, and the alarming child mortality rate can be reduced.</p>
<p>10,000 Refugees Will Not Be Repatriated</p>
<p>The Charitable Organizations Association of this port decided to suspend the winter relief due to the difficult times, which will make it impossible for the general poor and needy to survive the winter. There are still more than 5,000 refugees housed by the Refugee Association in the Refugee Camp on Dunxin Road, and more than 5,000 refugees housed by the Cilian Association and the Ciyuan Refugee Camp, totaling more than 10,000 people. The two associations have decided to continue to maintain them and will not repatriate them.</p>
<p>Salvation Army Continues to Raise Funds to Help the Needy</p>
<p>According to Mr. Walker, the leader of the Salvation Army in this port, the Salvation Army will begin its annual fundraising campaign on February 1st of next year, with a target of 200,000 yuan. He is very pleased with the enthusiastic donations from all walks of life in Shanghai to the Salvation Army's charitable work in the past few years, but he is also well aware of the current difficult environment. If the fundraising ends without reaching the original target, it is also reasonable. Mr. Walker also said that the Salvation Army's relief work has not been reduced due to the Pacific War and will continue to maintain its consistent policy until its funds are exhausted.</p>
<h3>Russian Chamber of Commerce to Handle Registration of Russian Businesses</h3>
<p>From January 2nd to 16th</p>
<p>The Russian Emigrant Committee issued a notice the other day, stating that all Russian-owned businesses in Shanghai, whether they are shops or factories, must register with the Russian Chamber of Commerce at No. 614 Foch Road before January 16th of next year. It is said that this registration is in response to the suggestion of the relevant authorities, so that the shops or factories opened by Russian emigrants in this port can be centrally managed. The reason is that some Russian shops have been open for business for a long time without registering with the Russian Chamber of Commerce. As for most of the shops that have already registered with the Russian Chamber of Commerce, they should still register again. The Russian Emigrant Committee solemnly stated that this registration is a necessary measure to protect the rights and interests of Russian emigrants in this port, and it can be used to compile a complete list of Russian businesses in this port, so as to facilitate inquiries by the relevant authorities. The registration period is from January 2nd to January 16th of next year, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry to Close Accounts Today, Reopen on January 5th</h3>

<h3>Embezzling Funds, Losing in Gambling, Lying About Being Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Fan Maolin, a runner of the Sanjie Weaving Factory at No. 5, Alley 950, Beller Road, French Concession, 30 years old this year, was ordered on the 17th of this month to collect account payments from five department stores that traded with him: Kelly on Avenue Joffre, Wuma Road Huigong, Dama Road Dingfa, Avenue Albert Xinhua, and Nanjing Road Guohua. After receiving a total of 3,186 yuan, Fan took the money to the Lubao gambling house in the South City to gamble. Unexpectedly, he lost all the money. The next day, the 18th, he returned to the factory and lied to the factory owner that he had received the account payments and was about to return to the factory, but when he was walking to Rue Paul Beau, he was kidnapped by several kidnappers who put him on a pre-parked car, drove to a house on Yidingpan Road, and locked him up overnight. He was released the next day, but all the money was robbed. The factory owner believed it to be true and reported it to the French police station. Xitan Chang ordered Detective Wang Baolin to investigate and found out the truth. The day before yesterday, Fan was taken into the police station. Evidence such as Lubao gambling house meal tickets and car tickets was found on his person. He was ordered to be detained for investigation.</p>

When Ms. Yao arrived, while they were talking, someone suddenly greeted Huang. Upon closer inspection, it was Zhang Baogen and Zhang Shanliang.

<h3>Lack of Rice Buyers Not a Sign of Abundance, but of Inability to Purchase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of domestic rice in the market continued to fall due to abundant supply and falling production costs. It was heard that the price of early and late rice in the suburbs had dropped to 150-160 yuan. Small vendors were seen constantly moving. The market offered 340-350 packages, with thin rice immediately falling to 210-206 yuan, and early rice at 208-203 yuan, both down by about 10 yuan. Due to the decrease in thin rice, the price of domestic glutinous rice also fell by 3-5 yuan, opening at 225 yuan. Those responsible for maintaining the food supply should not consider this a sign of abundance, but rather recognize that the general public is struggling due to high prices, reaching a point of exhaustion and inability to purchase this expensive domestic rice. People rush to buy foreign rice carts for miles, hoping to get three sheng of rice, crowding and struggling, willing to endure beatings and pressure, impossible to disperse. Why not buy domestic rice to satisfy hunger? However, domestic rice is displayed in rice shops, but few customers can afford it. The contrast between domestic and foreign rice is stark, like heaven and earth. The uneven distribution of joy and sorrow in life is extreme. However, the universal method of selling foreign rice has not yet been seen. The difficulty of obtaining food is now at its worst. It is only known to scrape together the stored grain within the boundaries, without considering the opening up of sources. The future of food supply is unfortunately even worse than today, which is truly a matter of life and death for the people within the boundaries.</p>
<p>While the price of domestic rice is gradually falling, the price of foreign rice remains high due to transportation difficulties. A small amount of crushed rice, 300-400 bags, is being sold, priced at 128 yuan. Other Saigon rice is mainly supplied for public sale, and it is difficult to find it in the market.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn Improves, Shuangma Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market is as stable as ever because the trend of gold is at a horizontal level, so people's hearts are stable. At the same time, the situation of Japanese yarn is getting better and better, which makes the market more peaceful. 20-count Shuangma factory started at 1,950 yuan, and then a small number of profit-takers sold, and the situation turned weak, loosening to 1,915 yuan. Finally, it rose back to 1,925 yuan, with a transaction of about 200-300 packages, and the market continued to rise by 50 yuan. 20-count Yueqin was 2,160 yuan to 30 yuan, 20-count Lanfeng was 2,400 yuan to 2,380 yuan, 20-count Shuangdiqiu was priced at 1,780 yuan to 50 yuan, 42-count Lanfeng thread was priced at 3,850 yuan to 801 yuan, and 16-count Hongkui Xing was 1,720 yuan.</p>
<p>The cotton situation is gradually showing signs of recovery. Rangoon cotton is wanted at 400 yuan, but there are few sellers. Brazilian cotton military tickets are 185 yuan. It is heard that the authorities have already purchased them.</p>
<h3>Raw Gold Rises for Four Consecutive Days, Reaching 3,350 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for raw gold continued to rise in price due to the strong push from gold shops and securities firms, reaching around 12,300. According to everyone's perception, the firmness is very solid. At the beginning of the morning, 20 taels were traded at 12,300 yuan per tael (10 liang). Then, a gold shop suddenly bought 5 taels from a customer at 12,400 yuan. Gold shops and securities firms then came in strongly, and retail investors also bought aggressively, so the price rose by another 800 yuan, breaking through 13,000 yuan. 10 taels were traded at 13,200 yuan. Suddenly, the bank gang sold, and the Tianjin gang and a gold shop came to sell, and there was also talk of the Hong Kong gang selling, and it immediately fell back 700 yuan to 12,500 yuan. At noon, it was bought by securities firms and gold shops, and it was raised again, finally reaching 12,850 yuan, up 750 yuan from the previous day, and it has risen rapidly for four days, for a total increase of 3,350 yuan.</p>

<h3>Facing the Torrent of Unemployment Head-On</h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>The problem of unemployment has become a torrent in Shanghai today. This torrent is unprecedented in Shanghai's history because the departments and groups of people affected are simply too many. So far, we have seen these departments and groups of people already suffering the misfortune of unemployment:</p>
<p>First, the dockworkers who run around on the Bund every day; when the importing and exporting ships stop, they have no work to do. Secondly, the number of employees in foreign companies in Shanghai, such as those of British, American, and Dutch companies, is also considerable. Due to the control of gasoline, many chauffeurs and truck drivers have no gas to drive. Because it is difficult to purchase steel raw materials, a large number of hardware and iron factories have successively dissolved. In particular, due to the cessation of the actual sale of goods, many yarn factories and so on have also stopped work one after another... If we were to make an estimate, the number would probably be between 300,000 and 400,000.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, this problem has become a concern for every Shanghai citizen.</p>
<p>Only by seeing the environment clearly can we decide on a course of action. Generally speaking, Shanghai's abnormal prosperity has come to an end, and now it is starting to fall rapidly like a parabola - this is simply an unstoppable fall. All that can be done now is to reduce the speed of this fall, that is, to maintain a bit of vitality.</p>
<p>I think these points should be noted:</p>
<p>First, although many manufacturers are encountering some economic difficulties, generally speaking, they will not lose money in the short term. Therefore, those who can maintain their operations should continue to do so. Otherwise, they should first consider tightening their belts, because everyone hopes that the Shanghai market will prosper one day. Therefore, those who can maintain a bit of vitality in terms of economics and technology now will be able to handle things easily in the future.</p>
<p>Second, if it is unavoidable to dissolve a company, such as those dissolved due to gasoline restrictions, then necessary living expenses for a reasonable period of time should be provided at the time of dissolution, so that they do not immediately become starving corpses and frozen bones. (Editor's note: Xiang Sheng, Yun Fei, and Yin Se, all three companies have already paid severance pay.)</p>
<p>Third, the most important thing is to work hard to suppress commodity prices. Otherwise, Shanghai will become an incredible place. Like these dockworkers without employers, who cannot receive any severance pay and cannot receive social assistance, not only will they become "a burden on Shanghai society," as the Western newspapers say, but they will also become a cause of unrest in Shanghai society!</p>
<h3>Those Who Come Can Still Be Pursued</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Time flies quickly, and the calendar on the desk has been turned to the last page. In terms of time, a year has passed. On the journey of life, we have reached another stop. Looking back and looking ahead, on this New Year's Eve, which serves as the end of a segment, we must either settle the accounts or plan next year's budget.</p>
<p>This year, whether for merchants or individuals, has been an unprecedented year. Profits and losses, may not be accurately calculated on the thirteen-bead abacus, but in fact, even a penny's difference is recorded. For example, the monopolistic manipulation of speculators, the rapid advance of the real estate industry, and the abnormal development of entertainment venues, before settling the accounts, did indeed dazzle people's eyes. Tonight, the psychological abacus of each protagonist must have a considerable profit and loss figure. As for individuals, most of them are unable to cash the checks they issued last year (probably the amount of the checks was too large). In addition to shame, it can be considered extremely fortunate as long as income and expenses are limited.</p>
<p>However, we cannot be hopeless about the future. Losing money in business is just a tactical mistake; doing something meaningless is also a muddle-headed act of the times. As the saying goes, "Those who come can still be pursued." Before the books of this year are closed, we should not ask about profits and losses, but think about the mistakes of the past and try to make up for them. Then, starting tomorrow, perhaps it will be a year when business is booming and reaching all over the world, and wealth is flourishing in the three continents.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sixteen - The Fire of Youth</p>
<p>Readers probably haven't forgotten about another protagonist in this book, Luo Xiangqi, right?</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, she was separated from her lover and daughter in a situation as violent as wind and rain. At that time, she really wasn't prepared to live anymore, but Yuan Baopan wouldn't let her die, even forgetting the shame that a person should have and saying to her:</p>
<p>"The things of the past are as if they never happened. As long as you don't hold a grudge against me, I will treat you the same!"</p>
<p>Later, Yuan Shaowen secretly comforted her again, telling her that Qiuhaitang had not died, but had only suffered some minor injuries and had escaped to the south. Although Xiangqi dared not ask him how Mei Bao was, she thought that since Qiuhaitang was able to escape, she would certainly not abandon Mei Bao. This comforted her heart slightly. However, soon after, she heard that Shaowen had suddenly shot Ji Zhaoxiong with a pistol. The others in the Yuan family thought that Ji Zhaoxiong had a bad temper and offended Seventh Master; but Xiangqi was very suspicious. She was very worried that Qiuhaitang and her daughter had been killed by Ji Zhaoxiong, so Shaowen wanted to shoot him and avenge his friend. However, the difficulty was that Xiangqi herself could not go out to find out. Since Yuan Baofan brought her back to Beiping, although he had not placed her under house arrest, her movements had become very inconvenient. Every time she went out, she was always accompanied by Second Mistress, or Yuan Baofan himself walked with her, so she never had the chance to separate herself and look for Zhao Yukun and many other colleagues of Qiuhaitang.</p>
<p>Those few years were really hard to get through. She was like a person who had lost her soul, getting up, eating, getting dressed, and sleeping with the crowd every year; sometimes she didn't even know whether the weather was cold or warm today.</p>
<p>Her father and brother often sent letters, and only when she received their letters did she feel a little warmth in her heart. In particular, she was most happy when her father said in his letter that her brother's health had fully recovered and that he had opened a small silk shop in Shanghai, and that the business was going very smoothly.

<h3>One Yuan, Five Jiao, Four Fen</h3>
<p>— Yini</p>
<p>The wind is blowing, the rain is beating, and the snow is falling. The air on the sidewalk is desolate and bleak enough. Even the rickshaw pullers have temporarily put down their shafts, rubbing their hands, and walking into the steamy little restaurant.</p>
<p>It's dinnertime, and the waiter in the small restaurant, straightening his throat, shouts loudly "Blood soup, tofu..." or "Mr. Yang (referring to a friend wearing a suit) bill two yuan and five fen."</p>
<p>Amidst the shouting, suddenly a friend wearing a gray cloth robe was punched and kicked by the waiter. This friend silently covered his head and slipped out. Everyone focused their attention on this beaten friend, but because everyone sweeps the snow in front of their own door, no one went to defend him.</p>
<p>Later, from the "mouth" of a very fierce waiter who was asked by a nosy person, he heard this sentence:</p>
<p>"Damn it, he looks decent, but he can't even pay one yuan, five jiao, four fen. He ate three bowls of white rice and three pieces of salted meat for nothing. Who else should I hit but this kind of guy?"</p>
<p>One yuan, five jiao, four fen, the price is a punch and a kick. Everyone lowered their heads and sighed.</p>

<h3>A Chronicle of Major Events in the Art World Over the Past Year (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jing Yi</p>
<p>In terms of drama:</p>
<p>(A) The progress of the drama movement: This year, the drama movement has been progressing at all times. Last year, there were only one or two formal theaters in the city, such as the "Shanghai Drama Society" and the Xuan Gong Theater. However, due to the urgent needs of the general audience, several more have emerged this year. They are also carefully and meticulously considering the selection of materials, the layout of costumes and props, and are gradually approaching perfection. Even theaters such as "Lubao" and "Dongfang," which specialize in performing civilized plays, have also entered the right track in order to avoid being eliminated by the audience. Recently, they have also given us many meaningful works to see, which is indeed a good phenomenon in the theater world this year and is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>(B) The rise of amateur drama clubs: With the development of professional theater troupes, amateur drama clubs have also been organized by a group of film actors and young men and women who love drama. Statistics show that there are no less than thirty or forty of them. Almost every week, they take turns giving public performances everywhere, occupying one aspect of the theater world. As for the general results of the performances, many of them are no less inferior to professional theater troupes. However, because they do not take this as a career, they often appear only once or twice and then disappear into thin air, and there are not a few of them.</p>
<p>(C) The dissolution of the two major theater troupes: In the last month of this year, an unfortunate change occurred in the theater world, that is, due to the influence of the January 28th situation, the "Shanghai Professional Theater Troupe" and the "Shanghai Drama Society," which had the greatest appeal in this city, dissolved one after another. We cannot deny that the progress of Shanghai drama to this day is largely due to the efforts of the members of these two theater troupes. This sudden loss is deeply regretted by the audience who love drama.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Art World</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama School has signed a contract with the Gengxin Stage and will perform at the stage's daytime performances starting from the first day of the new year. Guan Hongbin will be the stage director. The school's newly arranged plays, "Hongqiao Giving Pearls" and "Lion Building," are also scheduled to be performed in the new year.</p>
<p>This column previously reported that the Datong actor Gong Jianong was at a crossroads. It is now known that Gong was introduced by Fei Mu at the beginning of the month and joined Minhua, and was assigned to play a military role in the new film "National Colors and Heavenly Fragrance."</p>
<p>It is rumored that the second cartoon feature film "The Bee Queen" of the National Federation has been aborted because the total cost of the film is estimated to be about 400,000 yuan. The authorities decided to stop the work of the cartoon department, and all the students in the department have been dismissed.</p>
<h3>Asian Theater Company's Rotation Screening System</h3>
<p>The four first-run theaters of the Asian Theater Company, Majestic, Grand Cathay, Nanjing, and Cathay, will adopt a rotation screening system for the films screened from the first day of the new year. For example, Nanjing will screen the colorful blockbuster "Mermaid" starring Dolores del Río starting from the first day of the year. On the fourth, Grand Cathay will screen it. Grand Cathay will screen it until the seventh, and Cathay will screen it from the eighth to the eleventh, and then Majestic will take over. This rotation screening will not only adjust the audience's taste, but also reduce the inconvenience caused by traffic problems, because the audience can buy tickets and watch movies at the nearby theater.</p>
<h3>Blood Rain on Qionghua</h3>
<p>— Lian Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty: Wax Candles Welcome on the Battlefield</p>
<p>Xu Jing interjected and said, "I also think so. He didn't really want to fight the bandits for the country, but for the sake of his beloved concubine. He himself didn't have the courage. He wanted to take advantage of others, but he didn't want others to take advantage of him. The incompetent man ruins the country. How could he have the loyalty and bravery of General Zhou Yuji?" Xu Jing said this, and his righteousness was expressed in his face. Liu Wenyuan said coldly, "I wanted you to abandon him long ago. We had already left, but Chai Youji chased us back. Now that Beijing has been recovered, let's see what great things he can do? He will only get back Yuan Yuan, which is his own joy, and has nothing to do with the people of the world. Hmph! This kind of person who occupies a high position and does nothing, is ignorant of righteousness, and has a narrow vision, how can he build anything? If we continue to follow him, we will be scolded by others in the future. If you brothers can follow Youji's wishes and not leave, I can't stay for a day, and I will have to live up to your kindness." Xu Jing stood up and said, "At this time, not to mention that Brother Liu is leaving, I will also abandon him. Zhang and Chen brothers must have no reason to stay. Let's go." Zhang Cangqiu widened his eyes and said to the three people, "Let's just leave like this, and make that guy cheaper. Let's see how long that guy can be safe? We four brothers are all manly men, let's go to other places to make contributions and make a name for ourselves." Chen Fei said, "General Zuo Liangyu is guarding Wuchang, and he is also a hero. We might as well go there and try it. I also have a friend surnamed You under General Zuo, and we can go find him." Zhang Cangqiu said, "That's good too." Xu Jing and Liu Wenying had no objection. Because Chai Ying was very favored by Wu Sangui under Wu Sangui, and his attitude had gradually changed recently, and he was greedy for wealth and glory, they did not go to inform him, so as not to hinder him. Everyone secretly packed their things, and in a clear morning, carrying their luggage, they each rode their mounts, and quietly left the military camp, left Beijing City, and headed south. In the end, they abandoned Wu Sangui and left. The four people accidentally turned their heads on their horses and saw the outline of the towering and majestic capital city, and a burst of disappointment rose in their hearts.
