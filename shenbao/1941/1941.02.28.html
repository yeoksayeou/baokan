<h3>蘇聯與動盪中的國際</h3>
<p>近頃每論國際局勢演變的前途，屢次闡明所謂變局的重心，且以爲必須把握了變局重心，始得覷破似乎不可捉摸的衆相；幷嘗就當前種種，指陳其重心所在。所謂重心，是物埋術語；物理之中，歷來有很多原則適用於國內或國際政治；今以重心來剖析國際動盪的如何維繫，如何盤旋，以及如何趨歸，深信易於根據了重心而獲得局勢的輪廓。雖然，物理的重心並非一成不變，且可能的不祗一個重心，而重心倘作合理的轉移，更得運用無窮；例如軍用的坦克車，俯仰進行於丘壑之間，無盧顚躓，便是重心妙用。論國際，稱重心，却因國際重心可能的轉移而亦未可執一而論。</p>
<p>在今日的國際動盪之中，雖說頭緒紛繁，殆非任何一國一事一人所得而左右，然其間實有關鍵；假定說；中國發生了是否繼續作戰的問題，英國作戰已經到了非大勝即大敗的關頭，蘇聯不再得模稜兩可而必須立即表其左袒或右袒、美國參戰案竟列入了國會付表決的議事日程；當然這些完全是假定的，絕非現實問題，但是有關這四國的問題之嚴重性，每一個皆足以對於動盪中的整個國際變局，發生決定性質的作用：相形之下，如日本的南進與否，巴爾幹的安危如何，皆成了枝節，可見所謂國際重心眞是値得隨時加以重新審察。就四國動靜言，蘇聯最富彈性。</p>
<p>蘇聯在歐戰爆發的前夕，便處於舉足重輕的地位，年餘以來則因沉默而世人但覺其高深莫測。及至最近，有關蘇聯的消息又紛至沓來，甚囂塵上。舉其著者：一如巴爾幹方面保加利亞與土耳其的親和，盛傳蘇聯從中拉攏，而蘇聯則否認曾經居間。二如日蘇除漁業協定於協議延長時效之外，日本方面表示對蘇談判商的正在順利談判；且謂經濟性質的妥協是政治諒解的先聲，蘇日國交好轉云。三如美國華盛頓方面所傳，美國專家確認蘇日諒解倘告成立，則日本海軍便得對付美國；故美日和戰問題的決定，應視蘇聯史太林在最近將來出何動作。四如關於蘇德之間的關係，謂二國雖不圓滿，但蘇聯因竭力避免與德國衝突，故對於德國在巴爾幹方面的活躍，寗稍放任云。五如德國拉攏蘇日，原不是新課題；然美國所傳，德國且以聯絡蘇聯，調解中日戰事，爲這一課題中的重要慕序。諸如此類，實實虛虛；假定蘇聯決定了怎樣左右袒，誰也不難想像其影響的酷烈遠大。</p>
<p>但是，蘇聯之於當前國際，謂舉足重輕，必以「舉」爲條件，換言之，實際限於有何重要動作時，始形成爲動盪中的重心，始發揮其影響終局的決定作用；我們不辭武斷之嫌而加以推斷，則以爲蘇聯誠有如它所屢次宣稱的準備擊破任何來侵的敵人，現在却並沒有打算過如何選定了敵人，參加戰爭，予以打擊。假定參戰，纔眞是大力量，然而它不參戰。它對於强度的資本主義國家，在原則上是一視同仁的，英美德日任何一國，在它看來，全是一邱之貉；可是其間不無分別：以歷史，地理，以及思想態度而論，德日對它最有敵性，最有危險性，這是沒有理由得予否認；以國際關係論，歐戰中，它與德國極示籠絡，由德國軸心而推演，則對日亦自可能的發生苟合姻緣；因此而對英美兩國，始終保持其比較遠距離的若即若離。我們絕對沒有理由，得以置信於蘇聯不顧其立國的敵性與危險性而與德日站於一條戰綫，從事於對英美作戰。他在巴爾幹方面對於德國活躍所作的容忍，亦是限於這樣限度的容忍，決非間接直接的助長德國。他對日本的周旋，一面以不變更其對華援助政策爲必然的前提，一面又何嘗不覷破日本所期待於蘇聯者，以使蘇聯變更對華政策爲極則，次之，並非對美必戰而結歡蘇聯，却是由結歡蘇聯而取得對美脅迫的最自由的最高彈性。蘇日周旋的前途，可以到何程度，自不可知，但從蘇聯在西方對德國的曲意容忍，則不但不應推想爲他在東方亦將採取同樣態度，恰相反的，推想在東方的不予放鬆。</p>
<h3>東京談判未有進展　德古召開會議　參加者均為高級軍政長官　泰越對日折中案尙未答覆</h3>

<h3>疼痛對於社會的影響</h3>
<p>疼痛有時候給予我們很多的麻煩，當我們有一點頭痛的時候，我們就會做出錯誤的決斷，在　業上遭受嚴重的損失。如果在集會的時候，不能把意見發表。至於在社交界中，那是更有損害了，在約定的時候，不得不臨時取消我們的約會。</p>
<p>在家庭之中，疼痛也是不容存在的，如果一個主婦患着月經痛，那末家庭生活就充滿着痛苦，兒童們儘是胡鬧，當丈夫囘家的時候，看到睡在床上的妻子，顯出無上的煩悶。所以疼痛足以影響我們身體的健康，間接也足以影響整個社會的安全。</p>
<p>然而我們並不必去忍受疼痛，因為只要服用一片或者二片散利痛，疼痛就會在十分鐘之內停止的，絕對安全。無論那一個部份有那一種疼痛，散利痛是無上靈藥。</p>

<h3>糧食　價高招遠貨　厚薄粳米來源頓旺　洋米依然把持只有零星應市</h3>
<p>邇來洋米自成有市無貨之局面、不覺將一週、當局有進行澈查存底迫令出售之說「無如樓梯雖響、不見下來、故非但僵局難開、且復日甚一日、昨日依然乏貨應市、所開者除回籠八十五元之一號暹邏、及七十二元之次米菉、六十七元之次碎尖外、餘則仍僅期路貨原包英華司而已、」不知此種現象、何日始得消除、第思此輩一味把持現貨、置民食於腦後、無非欲求非法利潤、而擯持迄今、首當其衝者、莫若一般米鋪、蓋旣苦無從購貨、又須應付門市、在祗出不進情況之下、店積日益薄、又將暗中抬價、以次貨售高價、大量拼　碎米、所苦者仍爲無隔宿之糧、担石之儲的大多數人、其實調查囤米、並非難事、心存願忌、又無爲民除害之決心、千查萬查、亦查不出一些效果來、微聞汕頭幫收到之西貢米六千六七百包、三四天後可到申、在市以八十四元八角限價綫內售出、尚有續到各米亦在議價中、預料今明市面、囤戶即不顧大衆死活、亦將無所施其技、回籠期米、售開二月份一號西貢九十九元、小絞二月份九十一元三四角至九十一元半、三月小九十一元二角、碎米三四月份八十元、二三月七十九元八角、共計成交八百噸、現米二千包、路貨六千六七百包、市塲交易已漸見活潑云、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、因市面上一再飛騰、販戶頗有利潤、搬運欣奮、來源較旺、同時銷塲則以價格提足、稍見轉懈、致貨主雖又有喊高之聲、而卒難獲願、結果呈平定之局、售開各價與前相仿、若崑山斛粳仍爲百零八元至百零六元、青角薄稻斛見百零四元半、百零四元、</p>
<p>糯米在他貨跑跡之中、此獨不受限制一般客販遂都以糯米應市、致充斥於市者、無非皆是糯米、但糯米素屬補助之品、去路本狹、何堪銷納如許、因呈供求不勻、市勢垂軟、售價續貶元外、計開香港特別團粒糯八十九元至八十八元、長粒髙自八十七元二角、低至八十五元四角、糯箓八十元、</p>
<h3>從存米談起　觀察米市</h3>
<p>目前上海存米之數量甚鉅、足供居民六個月之消費、私人之存儲、尚不計算在內、民食恐慌、固無足虞、但價格仍難　低落、查民國二十八年上海輸入洋米共四五、七六五噸、約計總値一、四四一、〇〇〇美元、越南與泰國各供給二二、五〇〇噸、其大部份之輸入在年終、約有三六、〇〇〇噸、二十九年上　輸入洋米三九二、二二五噸、　　每月在三二、〇〇〇噸、就中二六九、〇〇〇噸來自越南、九八·〇〇〇噸來自泰國、二一、二〇〇噸來自緬甸、購價共値一四、〇〇〇·〇〇〇美元之譜惡果所屆、非惟米價飛漲、爲一般所能負擔、且因輸入增加、反需鉅額外匯、適以促成法幣之跌價、購買力隨之減低、</p>
<p>二十九年經營洋米之輸入商、其營業週轉數十倍於上年、獲利之鉅、自不待言、四五十餘冢米行承銷、復轉售於五百餘冢米店、轉輾買賣、及至消費者身上價已高昂、因之工商業金融界中人、紛紛將米投機、如從事棉紗及他種貨物投機者然、因而舉額米糧離開市塲、囤積於棧房之中、擯持不售、若內地出產之米能源源運滬、則米價必大跌、而從事投機米糧者、將受懲戒、而無如據金融商業報之記載、內地所產之米、除供給日本軍隊之消費外、去年輸出日本者爲數達七十萬噸、估計今年輸出之數當在一百萬噸之上、蓋日本之缺乏米糧與外匯、爲盡人皆知之事實、其由中國內地輸入之米、可以日幣支付而不必動用外匯、此着最關重要、統計此種需要以及日本軍隊每年在華所消費之四十萬噸、則本年內地米量之輸入上海、其不能超過二十九年可以預知矣、</p>
<p>去年內地輸入上海之米爲數約在三萬噸至四萬噸之間、較之滬地實際消費數、可謂極為渺小、但在最近數月、輸入之量又大形減少、此固爲上述原因、而爲「竹節統制」去矣、雖有揚言每月至少供給租界國產米一萬四千擔、但事實上權不伊操、何能實現、況此數僅足供上海居民一日半之消費、其與整個市面、關係甚微、現下國米甚貴、不啻爲負有人家所獨享矣、民國二十九年上海民食之需供狀況如下表、</p>
<p>洋米輸入數　三九二、二二五頓</p>
<p>內地米供給數　四〇、〇〇〇噸</p>
<p>總數　四三二、二二五頓</p>
<p>消費數　二九〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>餘存數　一四二、二二五噸</p>
<p>上項內地米之供給數、係根據市塲上之紀錄、此爲其約數、然可斷定其不能超過四萬噸、至若私相授受之另售數、其詳雖不易知、惟其數量之渺小、殊無足輕重、</p>
<p>所不可不知者、上海居民消費米之量、每月常不超過二萬二千噸、日有逐漸減少之趨勢、推其故半由於米價之騰貴、自然節縮、或改食雜糧、半由於居民之離開兩租界者日多、故去年年終之一四一、二二五噸存數、不致動搖、而本年一二兩月進口之洋米、不下六七萬噸、滬上洋米到存之充斥可見、然而市面如此、囤積居奇者之肉、寗足食耶、（林）</p>
<h3>粉麥路貨將到</h3>
<p>麵粉以定貨即將湧到、華廠所定洋麥、亦將同時抵埠、客囤心思冷淡、惟囤戶以目下現粉存底缺乏、在巨額途貨未到前、尚不願過於遷就、故市面已呈僵局、上午做開藍麥花牌洋粉五百包、價廿五元八角至七角半、晚市又鬆數分、惟高檔粉美麗牌仍以缺貨帶堅、華廠平賣粉、仍照二十三元批出數千包、悉由指定號商購去、</p>
<p>小麥因產價步高、內地購源枯乏、各廠原料欲供不易、日廠門市雖經放價、亦屬無貨可收、華廠正待洋麥接濟、對於本麥限盤仍爲四十元、但市塲喊價竟達四十二三元、</p>
<h3>雜糧　米飯吃不起　改吃苞米</h3>
<p>拋售不下七八十萬包</p>
<p>自米價有漲無跌以來、各鄉各地之民食、大都賴各種粗糧拌食、故苞米（即珍珠米）（包穀）（玉蜀黎）一物去路頗活、滬埠仍不脫轉運樞鈕、所以雜糧市塲、更覺生意興隆、似西貢苞米不論期現、進出均大、一般業內外投機份子、因鑒於西貢一地處於世界戰雲籠罩之下、使市價之起伏、尤頗龐大、前後拋售之貨不下七八十萬包、刻下棧存及未到之數、亦有二十萬包左右、市因去路有華北華中及浙省、故其漲風亦似米價之猛烈、昨市先漲後跌、結果仍超出前市、統計成交西貢現苞米二千餘包、及二月份交二百噸、行情均詳　價欄、本市亦有苞米粉出售每斤價二角七八分、</p>
<p>又二十八日出口、有豆子四百六十包、運往香港、又一百七十包、運往海口、豆餅一萬四千四百塊、運往香港、</p>
<h3>金融　美匯湧出</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、晨開微軟、嗣後走勢不定、英美行吃胃甚殷、而華銀行一致塞出、以美匯爲多、故市面略形硬化、但先令終見緊俏、午收仍告三辦士三九〇六二五、後市內傳中美簽訂協議、人心又虛、投機家遂來賣出、日銀行亦吐、潛勢趨鬆、現美匯成交價爲五元五九三七五、比上日軋縮〇一五六一五、美匯則長〇三一二五、</p>
<p>華商港電均售</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期平定、遠期跌〇六二五、紐約銀價平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美不動、對滬小一分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士三九〇六二五、美匯五元五三一二五、較之上日晚收價、英軟〇三二五、美亦緊〇三一二五、開後華銀行首塞、英行有利亦賣、故市面平中帶穩、三月份美匯售價爲五元五三一二五、均係麥加利滙豐所吃入、九點半滙豐掛牌揭曉、各匯勿動、白銀平衡稅無上落、此後市面不定、惟洋行有售出、計二月份美匯某美行吸進達五元五六二五、嗣因投機商忽來購納、故雖有港商道亨及華銀行吐塞、市面仍無變化、計三月份美匯一致做五元五三一二五、午收價現貨美匯爲五元五六二五、英匯三辦士三九〇六二五、下月份美匯五元五三一二五、英匯三辦士三七五、</p>
<p>美長英金反緊</p>
<p>後市爲狀假鬆、因華商投機家始終賣出、日銀行亦售、先塞予外行本月份美匯五元五九三七五、又三月份美匯五元五六二五、時傳中美簽訂協定說、人心浮動、後某美行亦吸入投機家三月份美匯五元五六二五、晚收依然硬化、計現貨美匯告五元五九三七五、三月份五元五六二五、先令現貨及三月份俱爲三辦士四〇六二五、比上日價美匯期現均長〇三一二五、英匯現貨反見軋軟〇一五六二五、期貨平定、</p>
<p>香港匯價平定</p>
<p>香港二十七日（週四）電、今晨匯市開盤平定、英日及申匯均無榮辱、美匯現貨硬一二五、爲二十四元半、十一時三十分告平、各匯槪無變動、下午二時三十分開盤告平、申匯現貨降落一元、爲四百三十九元、其餘不動、</p>

<p>天津二十七日（週四）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、倫敦及紐約電匯仍無上落、申匯亦站九十元〇七角五分、「聯鈔」暗盤獨昂九角、爲七十八元、</p>
<h3>散戶咸有賣出　金市疾退</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、遽告下落、午後因傳中美簽訂協定、外匯報長、人心鬆動、撳入六千二百元內、最低達六千一百六十元、惟晨初市面甚堅、開盤告六千三百元、開後曾至六千三百十元、迄午收止、中途起伏雖巨、而成記恒記等維持下、尚告六千二百六十七元、午後初狀仍平、迨上述消息傳來、桓記及散戶一致狂塞、跌風開始、晚收前降達六千一百六十元、收盤祗六千一百七十元、比上日軋低八十三元、全日交易共三萬餘兩、掉期（二月轉入三月）賣方約貼出四十元、現金突又驚入劇漲、初由成記出祥和一百二十兩、照期交價高四百六十元、該金號再進五百餘兩、證券號德孚進三百餘兩、故至正午祥興永進成記十兩、須高五百十五元、下午買戶更湧、售者居奇、飛上更　、裕泰　進永成十兩、竟高六百元、祥和復進永成裕興永各五十兩、高九百八十元、飾金亦升起十元、達五百九十元、關金等均平</p>
<p>期貨又見做高</p>
<p>最初以人心向上、開盤檯面買氣甚旺、故猛抬至六千三百元、比上日做高四十餘元、開後再升十元、達六千三百十元、嗣爲新豐永德孚成記等力售、而回跌至六千二百五十五元、惟大豐成記等斯時又掀買風、重拉至六千三百十元、奈公和成記大豐新豐永等復來吐出、而人心略現不定、於是爲狀較軟、退達六千二百三十五元、終以恒記已萌買意、成記亦搜、盤旋向上、至六千三百七十五元、迨午收則告六千二百六十七元、午後開盤平平、爲六千二百六十元、仁承永大豐新匯永等稍撈、好起五元、爲六千二百六十五元、嗣因塲內謠傳中美簽訂協定、匯市已報硬化、散戶咸售、恒記猛拋、撳入六千二百元關內、告六千一百八十元、後賴一大大豐等乘低補進、走勢較堅、曾回出六千二百元關、達六千三百二十元、惟以後賣風又熾、降至六千一百六十元、晚收僅六千一百七十元、比上日軋小八十三元、全日上落一百五十元、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤（現貨）高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金回大</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、上午九點半爲六百九十元、午後二點四十分爲六百八十元、三點鐘回升十元、結果大同行掛六百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元云、</p>
<p>外幣高後終小</p>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤市價雖跌、然現金價則仍挺俏、故英美金鎊、僅各跌一元、美金票漲後回落、始因大通大量開進而步髙至九角二分、終因黑市美匯趨鬆而步落、卒爲十七元七角二分、比上日軋跌三分、香港票供給稍旺、市價略疲、日金票及朝鮮票均不乏需要、市價赓續挺漲、前者升爲一元七角七分、後者髙至一元四角三分、</p>
<h3>證券　內債腳地甚堅</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨日市況、上午因信孚暫見停手、市價微小、交易頗見清閒、午後信孚又有買進、同時順昌多頭加碼、同順新華及聯益均有買進、市價又略髙、形式呈盤旋狀況、但上午鼎康頗有買進、鴻大頗有賣出、午後爲聯合同康賣出、收盤後又中英美經濟同盟之說、人見便見穩定、變動之來、當尚在後、目下暫見盤旋而已、不過腳也甚堅、不可不防也、市價結果稍稍回小五分一角至三角、丁種及九六未有做開、成交總數共計不過一百四五十萬、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>又衆業公所股市、趨勢仍軟、怡和紗廠所跌較鉅、開盤價爲四十四元、後步降至四十一元半收盤、國際·企業·英聯·亦告下游、但其腳地尚穩、惟橡皮股寗靜、</p>
<p>倫敦二十六日（週三）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、均告平滯、市價槪無上落、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗棉多方　拉力殊強　午後稍有回挫</h3>
<p>紗市仍緊、且漲風甚熾、此因上日盛傳工部局對於電氣節省、紗廠恐有減工之說、於是投機者、乘機活躍、買風奇盛所以雙馬曾一度漲出一千四百元關外、兩日來狂跳百元以外、但有一部份因外匯放長、及現銷不起、且牌雜紗價不振、二十支雙地球一千二百元、尚賣不出、較雙馬廉二百數十元、因之在四百元外復來放空、市面乃硬中帶軟、二十支雙馬最高價一千四百十六元、午後爲一千三百八十六元、午後金價回挫、初做一千　百九十元、跌至一千二百七十五元、最後價爲一千三百七十三元、二十八日棉紗運香港二百二十件、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、承上日午後堅挺之氣續進、且多方拉力殊強、首盤價爲一千四百元、即升至四百十六元旋以盈利者了結、回下至一千三百九十二元、但多頭仍不放棄、再出四百元關外、以後聞金價下墜、人氣鬆弛、又跌至一千三百八十八元收盤、查半日間成交統計八千八百六十包、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港　三五〇　寗波一〇</p>
<p>同　八、五〇〇　統計八、八六〇</p>
<p>現棉情況、仍在平靜之境、但廠方有減工之訊、對於原棉採辦、心思更淡、加之棉紗銷路仍屬寥寥、所以紗價亦　　不定、</p>
<p>紐約棉市、先因同業買進而漲、繼因現貨商及　方幫賣出同跌、結果收盤價格較之上日低落約二三磅因、</p>
<p>印度棉市甚平、良以日來交易渺小、並無重大變化、昨日連同預測低落半羅比左右、</p>
<p>滬埠紗棉交易、紗廠似將決定減工、故外棉交易、因之亦入靜寂之途、</p>
<h3>疋頭　廠布上落不大　東疋現貨買戶稀</h3>
<p>廠布　昨日先漲後跌、乃因人心恍惚、先以電力減少供給說而漲、繼以中美經濟協定說、售盤重復下墮、富貴細布晨開四十三元七角半、較上日每疋漲二角半、午後售四十三元二角半、結果各牌細布·斜紋較上日上落甚微、粗布晨盤較堅、午後回疲、成交未旺、本街染廠及囤戶搜辦粗細布柸布四百餘件、浙東甬台幫辦細布·漂布·色布五六十件、閩粵幫辦府綢·色布·漂布等貨一百數十件、</p>
<p>東布　市氣仍昂、白貨細布以中檔各牌實需殷切、續升每疋二角半至五角、兩龍頭細布因受發現僞棧單之影響、買戶寥落、反跌　角半、細斜亦各提漲二角半至五角、蓋最近本街染銷開展貨底漸薄故也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　滬絲出口困難　市氣至形銷沉</h3>
<p>日來海外絲價。逐漸盤上、紐約·橫濱現期各貨、均相當回漲、奈出口困難、致本埠洋莊絲　迄未見起色、昨日僅白廠絲二〇－二二七十八分有所售開、計價四九五〇元、用戶市塲、亦告清淡、因之市氣至形清淡、</p>
<h3>南北貨　大片圓肉續升</h3>
<p>大片圓肉、入春以來到貨至稀、故號方前存之貨、扳守甚力、現在開出雖少、但市價已升起二十餘元、惟需要較稀、價位已達最高峯、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白小七八角</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢更形疲轉、續降七八角、公會劃盤、二十四粗白外棧現貨七十九元三角至七十九元、小八角、期貨下月二十日打單八十元至七十九元五角、小七角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十八元五角、小六角、東棧七十八元四角至七十八元、DY嘜西棧七十七元、HX嘜西棧七十六元、</p>
<h3>煤炭　劣質煤球又見於市</h3>
<p>——旣不發火又不耐燒——</p>
<p>煤球行情、素來不漲則跌、今日明市雖尚穩定、暗中同業間競爭甚烈、祗管削價、不顧成本、致少數不顧信譽之廠家爲營業計、多偷工減料、以劣屑烟囱灰混合製造、其出品旣不發火、又不經燒、店家貪圖厚利、魚目混珠、而用戶暗中受虧不少、故甚望該業公會、予以注意、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵日益昂</h3>
<p>會司鐵連日漲風頗旺、乃因太平洋之風雲、本市存底難免有斷檔之日、故執有該貨者心思異常堅挺、非至優秀價格有不願讓人之感、故製罐廠玩具廠印刷廠等搜羅甚緊、以防原料不繼、開價扶搖直上、昨如二百磅老鋼廠沽二百二十元、新鋼廠售二百十五元、</p>
<h3>海味　安南尾回跌</h3>
<p>安南蝦尾、近因來源略增、價遂回鬆、昨市行盤如金鈎尾爲四百五十元、田邊尾四百四十元至四百三十元、比前小二十碼之譜、</p>
<h3>經濟叢譚　數字別體</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>數字作之壹·貳·叁·肆·伍·陸·柒·捌·玖·拾·阡·陌·等字，明陸容菽園雜記謂「始於明初刑部尚書開濟，然宋邊實崑山志已有之。蓋錢殼之數，用本字，則姦人得之盜改，故易此以關防之耳。」按陸容爲明崑山人，其所言如此，正見明人對此種數字採用之由來，已爲說紛紜。清海寗查愼行得樹樓雜鈔，有較詳之考據，其言曰：</p>
<p>「古書一爲弌，二爲弍，三爲弎，蓋以弋爲母，而一二三隨數附合以成其字，不知單書一畫爲一等字，起自何時。程大昌演繁露云：今官府文書，凡記數皆取同聲而點畫多者改用之，以其不可改換爲姦也。顧炎武謂，數目壹·貳·叁·肆·等字，皆武后所改。洪容齋隨筆曰：古書及漢人用字，一與壹，二與貳，三用叁，其義皆同。」</p>
<p>按顧炎武之說，諒必有所本。蓋武則天於字嘗多改作，如以「一人大吉」爲「君」字，忠字上加一畫爲「臣」字，諸如此類，殆亦可能。惟不論始於何時，宋以前已有之，故容齋隨筆有此說也。</p>
<p>柒字之來臨，得樹樓雜鈔所論，頗饒意味，其言曰：</p>
<p>「桼古七字。太玄經玄攤曰，運諸桼政。方言曰，吳有桼娥之臺。王莽候鉦銘，重五十桼斤是也。唐碑書七字，亦有作漆者。後人省筆作柒，柒即漆之草書。今作柒，又柒之省。」</p>
<p>余按柒爲漆之草書，頗可置信。觀下列三字，一爲漆之眞書，一爲草書，一即柒字，固有其筆路變化之跡可尋也。</p>
<h3>柒</h3>
<p>至於二十作廿，三十作卅，四十作卌，由來已久，俱見說文，其說有云：</p>
<p>廿，（音入）二十幷也。</p>
<p>卅，（音颯）三十也，今作卅，十倂也，亦作卉，直爲三十字。</p>
<p>卌，（音先立切）直爲四十字。</p>
<p>可見廿卅卌之書法，爲寫數字時自然之結搆，中國古代用籌算，故倂寫之數字，類皆橫畫豎道相合以成，此可見其遺跡也。</p>
<p>算盤始於何時，余於算籌籌馬一文中，云未知其由來。友朋中頗以此爲問，余自問，讀書無多，未敢臆斷。亦有謂北齊時已有之者，見之於算書，但此算書之本身，余尚有懷疑。惟余目前差堪引述者，籌算至宋時，必有一番改革，因歷算之書，遍閱廿五史，無過於宋史所列之多也。即如等子（俗稱戥子）亦始於宋初，有暇當集其一鱗半爪，再與讀者相商酌。明知叢談之作，掛漏良多，然皆信手拈來，聊以消遣。無非就聞見所及，紀事物之始，求進化之迹，爲改善之資，並以備後之整理國故者闢一綫之途徑而已！至言其詳當俟諸專書問世。</p>

<p>大陸報評論云、日本首相近衛文麿昨日宣稱、日本政府對於日本及美國未來之外交關係、並不悲觀、近衛發表此言後、太平洋緊張局勢、因而略見鬆馳、目下太平洋之和戰關鍵、全操於日本之手、此爲盡人皆知之事、英國現正在歐洲從事生死之掙扎、因之決不願在遠東作不智之挑戰、而美國在此集中全力援助抵抗侵略之國家時、亦不願與日本作戰、而使希特勒稱快、因之近衛此言確能使遠東人士之呼吸、略爲輕鬆、同時、在華盛頓之野村、亦必能快樂多多、</p>
<p>遠東危機並未消失</p>
<p>然若困此而遽認太平洋危機業已過去、實屬錯誤、因近衛以爲「日本政府所循之路如不錯誤、即不必發生任何疑懼、故決心使英美兩國了解日本之眞實意旨」云、前途之困難、即在於此、英美兩國對於日本之「眞實意旨」、早已了解無餘、若欲令彼等進一步了解、殊爲一不可能之事、是以近衛之言、決不能使英美改變其「看牌」之初衷、英美兩國將繼續加緊其太平洋之防禦。俾能獲得勝利、</p>
<p>行動力量勝於言論</p>
<p>英文大美晚報評論近衛前日所發之言論稱、我人對於近所稱、「日本正設法使英美了解日本之眞實意旨」、雖略有不解之處、然我人對於其所稱日政府對於未來日美外交關係、並不悲觀之言、實表滿意、日本之「眞實意旨」如何、英美固早已了解、英美之了解日本、不由於日本人婉和之言論、而由於日本國駐外代表之所作所爲、近衛等和顏悅色之言論、其對英美所發生之力量、遠不如在華之日本軍人之折下一外國旗幟、侵入外人住屋、掠佔外人財產、阻碍外人貿易、傷害外國　民爲巨大、此類軍人一日不繩之以法、此類事件一日不能根絕、則外人即認此種行爲代表日本之行爲、亦即代表日本之「眞實意旨」、一切婉和之言論、皆屬無效、</p>

<h3>三百萬元銅塊昨已提交日方　茂生已函請撤銷懷特勒案　但須出庭後始能收回拘票</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本市美商茂生洋行、前因寄存美商瑞豐運輸公司棧房中價值三百萬元之銅塊、被瑞士僑民懷特勒糾眾竊去、乃向美國駐華按署控訴瑞豐公司保管疏忽、此案延期、定今（二十七日）晨開審、茲聞已第四次延期至三月十一日開審、而茂生洋行約十天前、已經懷特勒從中奔走、與日當局商妥、將該行存於本市各棧房中價值一千二百萬元之銅塊（連前三百萬元之銅塊在內）售予日當局、頃聞此項銅塊、現正從各棧房運出、移交日方、茂生洋行某員今晨承認銅塊移交、惟稱、關於移交事、尚未能發表確切消息、該員對于茂生洋行紐約總行料將來電核准此項買賣事、亦不發一言、今晨又聞茂生洋行已致函公共租界警務處與驢滬瑞士總領事方丹納爾、撤銷其對懷特勒竊取銅塊所控各節、方氏今晨證實已接此函、惟稱依照瑞士法律、必須經過懷特勒出庭之手續後、始能撤回前對懷特勒所發之拘票、</p>
<h3>上海煤斤短缺　電力供給可慮　自來火公司亦同遭困難　船舶被徵印煤無從運滬</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、上海電力公司副總裁發里斯氏（廿六日）告記者稱、最近將來、上海苟無煤斤賡續按期運到、則公共租界有在一二個月內减少其電力供給之可能、目下該公司存有可供三個月需用之煤斤、若非迅有若干煤斤運到、則該公司即將不能長久賡續供給所需之全部電力矣」、</p>
<p>界實業活動减少之前、每月用煤自五萬五千噸、」</p>
<p>自來火受同一影響</p>
<p>又據英商自來火公司秘書白朗聲稱、該公司目下未遇難關、但雖獲煤斤、確係事實、從「七七」中日戰事爆發以來、運來益趨惡劣、向印度購煤、固無困難、所成問題者、厥爲難獲運煤來滬之船隻、英商等船舶改服戰役者日多、上海電力與自來火兩公司困難亦日甚、」</p>
<p>整個需求難以應付</p>
<p>上次世界大戰時、每噸煤之滬費從常時之二三十先令一度漲至一千四百先令、目今局勢尚未如此惡劣、但船隻之不敷、已成問題、現租界居民對自來火之需求甚巨、尤因各工廠難獲煤斤、致轉用自來火、但自來火公司亦已應用其藉油發火之預備廠、惟僅賴以補助主廠供應之不足、而不能應付各方對於自來火之整個需求、</p>

<h3>新普育堂成績優異激發社會同情　呂桂叢君代募一萬餘金　本報讀者一致予以援助</h3>
<p>自本報發動新普育堂募捐運動以來，深荷社會人士予以同情的贊助，所募數目，已有可觀。昨復接讀者呂桂叢君函，述參觀南市新普育堂經過及所獲印象，肫摯熱烈，活躍紙上。呂君說：「已代他們捐了一萬二千多元」，此後仍然要繼續努力代他們觀募。他本人且擔認永遠月捐五十元，這是何等動人的一件偉績呀！此外，更有一位民族小弟弟，致譽新普育堂修女，願捐節蓄二百元，並且寫着：「將來那些小朋友們裏頭，（指孤兒們）一定要有英雄發現」。這雖是孩子們線潔的祝頌，但是這句話，誰也不能否認的，因爲每一個嬰孩出世，他日都有成爲偉人的可能，成功失敗，完全在於敎養。現在新普育堂的數百孤兒正陷於斷糧的絕境，能坐視不救嗎？希望本報讀者們一致起來響應！</p>
<p>偉大的同情者</p>
<p>申報館編輯先生惠鑒：近來多少日子時常讀到貴報登載介紹新普育堂的文章，引起各界注意，陸陸續續的有人捐款，鄙人對於該堂，也有一般同情的事實，特借貴報一陳之。我的朋友安樂廠鄧仲和先生，自見貴報倡導此項運動後，即約我到南市新普育堂去參觀，我當時莫名其妙，祇是隨便的隨之前去，那知那地方規模很大，據說佔地有一百多畝，圍牆內蓋了不少的房子，樹木空氣，不亞於一個公園，房子的建築，雖不華麗，但亦不在普通水平线以下，其清潔整齊，則等於一所很好的學校，內中主持人，即是十幾位在馬路上時常看見戴白帽子的嬤嬤們，據說她們是「　修女」，專爲敎會服務，沒有家庭，換句話說，他們的精神灌注於貧苦大眾的心坎中，沒有半個私字。當時我覺得此話若果是眞的，的確修得佩服。迨參觀各處所有課堂寢室醫院病房等等之後，果然是眞的，不但令人十分滿意，而且令人十分感動。他們所收留的人數大約有八九百名，其中老的八九十歲，小的有生下地纔幾天的嬰兒，除却老的殘亥的及四五歲以下的小孩沒有工作之外，其餘無論大的小的，男的女的，均有可做的工作，均有相當的精神，均有相當的紀律，尤其十齡左右的小天使們活潑潑地令人可愛。我覺得這一般人在表面上算是無家可歸，無人敎養，列於乞丐一流，在實際上他們算是有福氣。無論老的小的家庭中，卽使有飯吃絕對沒有這樣好環境，我又以爲在上海住亭子間　披間的朋友更不用說了，即使如我本人，住的是一樓一底新式房子，其環境亦望塵莫及，又如我的兒子在我家中所愛之敎養，在上海社會中總算是在水平線以上的，但是比之新普育堂的小天使們實在相差其遠。因爲父母愛子，總有許多莫名其妙的偏衛，不是失之過嚴，便是失之溺愛，又因爲家中傭人及親戚朋友的屋鳥之愛，將這個小孩子弄得不上正軌。然而新普育堂的小天使們完全不同了，他們沒有遠近之分，沒有親疏之別，住的是一樣，吃的是一樣，敎的是一樣，玩的是一樣，早晚起居也是一樣。首先，他們生活上有了紀律，耳聞目見的，不是讀書，便是做工，外邊的一切不良習慣，我敢擔保這般小天使的心目中是絲毫沒有一點印象的。在他們小的時候已經受了這樣好環境好紀律的熏陶，將來入社會至低限度不會做壞事，說不定還要造就若干的大人物，亦未可知。至於嬤嬤們一切行爲，不但無私心，背負責任，處理工作有條有理，此外還有一種特別的美德，卽是一慈祥可親」，沒有一點脾氣。我親眼看見一般小天使對之若慈母，那些老公公老婆婆亦愛之若家人。我又敢擔保說，在普通人家庭裏絕對沒有這樣親愛精神的表現。現在社會上慈善團體固然很多，我因爲沒有工夫去參觀，不知道是何景象，不敢說長道短，這個新普育堂的情形是我親自看見的，故敢大膽的爲他們介紹出來。</p>
<p>他們以前基金如何？但是現在經費無着了。我自參觀以後，前天又邀了幾個朋友作第二次考察，所以實心實地的要代他們　點力了。除掉我本人擔認了永遠月捐五十元外，陸陸續續的共已代她們捐了一萬二千多元，以後仍然要繼續努力代他們觀募，募到多少是多少，以求我的心安。不過我本人力量有限，認識朋友亦甚少，恐怕杯水車薪，無濟於事，用特專函前來，務請貴報代爲呼籲，並且希望對於這類新聞，時常登載，俾可引起社會上多數人士注意，更希望有人前去參觀，將所得的印象，隨時宣佈出來，庶幾新普育堂的事業不致中途停頓，一般老的小的同胞們得有敎養，這種實實在在的慈善，不可同日而語也百忙中拉雜書陳，還有書不盡意之感，此請公綏。呂桂叢。卅，二，廿五。</p>
<p>小朋友的熱情</p>
<p>新普育堂的諸位嬤嬤們：　天媽媽帶我到你們這裏來參觀，看見許多老公公老婆婆和許多失去了父母的小朋友，他們的生活，雖然是很簡單，不過他們也有他們的樂趣。他們的紀律很好，我們學校的紀律，也沒有他這樣好。我看了之後，頗爲感動，覺得都是你們管理得好的結果。我把我從前寫字從爸爸那裏得到二百元，就　給你們，今將此　送交三馬路綢業銀行信託都轉交，請你們　去領取。就現在　　　發生　　醫生　　叫我休養，所以我說在不　寫字了，將來我的毛病好了　　，我再代你介　法子弄點　　，請你們加上　　，格外努力，　　　　小朋友們裏頭一　　　　　　。我祝你們　　此　　　　　，二月二十三日。</p>

<h3>尶𡯓</h3>
<p>— 亮</p>
<p>欲行則行，欲止則止，欲做則作，欲罷則罷，這不得謂之尶𡯓。</p>
<p>所謂尶𡯓者，欲進不可，不進又不能，欲做不得，不做又不興，這纔謂之尶　。</p>
<p>穿上長衫尶𡯓，肩不能挑，手不能提，尶𡯓。交易市塲起落不定，尶𡯓。做多頭不可，　空頭又不可，尶𡯓。無錢尶𡯓，有錢亦是尶𡯓。無錢填不飽肚子，有錢則有被請財神之虞，尶𡯓。</p>
<p>欲不尶𡯓，亦有辦法：無論立身行己，必先打立主意，立定脚跟，可做則做，不可做即不做，做而失敗是怎樣辦法，做而勝利是怎樣辦法，算計已定，放膽做去，便不至於尶𡯓。苗頭不對，便不進行，亦不尶𡯓。</p>
<p>最尶𡯓的，便是投機取巧，患得患失，所謂「食癆怕丟臉」。投機則恐失敗，取巧則被人捉穿，這真是有些尶𡯓了。</p>
<h3>「無所謂」老爺</h3>
<p>— 徐翊</p>
<p>聽「無所謂」老爺自己跟人說，他是一位「十足」履行「無為無不為」哲學的「哲士」。而且，他又是一個頂頂刮刮的不求「虛名」但求「清凈」的亂世「隱士」！</p>
<p>旣是這樣，君子擇鄕而居，我們的「無所謂」老爺使自然地在「清凈樂土」的上海住了下來，所謂「住」當然是含有「隱居」的意見。</p>
<p>三年來，老爺的「道」高深了許多，他不但自以為能得道家的妙旨，而且也能將道義發揚光大使之「時代化」。何謂「時代化」呢？老爺束起雙袖，拾起肥而且重的雙層下巴，微笑道：</p>
<p>「妙哉！惟余一人能得斯道之微乎！」</p>
<p>於是，老爺的肥體頓時「飄飄然」起來。</p>
<p>雖然「得天獨厚」的「無所謂」老爺，不肯洩漏「天機」來昭告眾生得道之法，但是你若細察他平日的言行，究竟也可以領悟一二。譬如你問他：</p>
<p>「老爺，你對於××事件感到怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「哈哈……我嗎？我是無所謂的。……」</p>
<p>「老爺，××救濟會出了岔子，你以為應該怎樣調停才好？」</p>
<p>「哈哈……我嗎？我是無所謂的。……」</p>
<p>「老爺，××按摩院創業那天，他們要請你去揭幕，你去嗎？」</p>
<p>「哈哈……我嗎？我是無所謂的。……」</p>
<p>聞其聲如見其人，「無所謂」老爺之所以成為「無所謂」老爺者，當然是由於他的對百事都是「無所謂」之故。然而，你可別上他的當，要是你只知其一不知其二，貿然地去學他的「無所謂」哲學，那我可告訴你，你準得變為一個毫無出息的窮光蛋！</p>
<p>因為他雖然　對人說他自己萬事都是「無所謂」，然而實際上却也有例外，（為什麽例外呢？我說這就是他老人家「道學高深」的地方，令人高深莫測）譬如他一瞧見米價大漲，他便會得意得從鴉片舖上跳起來，一手扭住第三姨太太的膀子，一手起勁地裝着腔勢說：</p>
<p>「哈哈……棧房裏的八百担貨色！八百担！前天才……今天已漲到……」雖然他一時還算不清他的「進賬」，但總之已是　了許多，對於數目上的問題，橫豎有剛從大學經濟系出來的兒子來承管，他可以「無所謂」了。</p>
<p>但頂糟糕的，是聽說有人要當眾揭發他的囤積了，於是他氣得發抖，東奔西走的往西方去疏通，結果形勢的確稍為和緩了，但究竟還有人敢在　上暗罵他，於是老爺便又拿出了他的「護身符」，淡淡地說：</p>
<p>「任他們去，任他們去，罵也好。不罵也好，我是無所謂的。」</p>
<h3>剌刀</h3>
<p>— 直酼</p>
<p>處世之道無它，唯一「誠」字而已。</p>
<p>說話要循規蹈矩，做事要脚踏實地。</p>
<p>不要以一知半解，為完全的學問。</p>
<p>你能暫時欺騙自己，但不能永遠欺騙自己。</p>
<p>「謙虛」是最好的本錢。</p>
<p>養成「今日事今日畢」的習慣。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（四）意外的遇合</p>
<p>趙四雖然年紀比較最大，已算是老江湖了，但一時也不由嚇得慌了手脚，站在扶梯口，儘向那兩個臉色同樣變成了灰白的師兄弟呆着看，不知道應該怎樣對付才好。</p>
<p>「一人做事一人當！他要是真死了，我就給他償命！」玉崑的臉色突然一紅，原有的勇氣霎時已回復了一半，他也不招呼別人，便獨自急忙忙的奔下樓去。</p>
<p>「老……二……」秋海棠想喊住他，可是不知怎樣，嗓子已啞得一些喊不響了。趙四是知道他的性格的，這種事情根本對付不來，便竭力先把他勸回了房裏去，自己答應立刻帶着榮奎下樓，好歹替趙玉崑說幾句話，回頭再來報告。</p>
<p>其是馬金壽和另外幾個配角，也聽到了響動，紛紛擁進秋海棠的房裏來探問；有的還自告奮勇的隨着趙四下去張羅，有的就在秋海棠房裏留着，大家七張八嘴的議論。</p>
<p>也不知等了多少時候，趙四等六七個人才急急忙忙地趕回來報告沈麻子沒有死，只是傷得很重，已送進醫院去了。玉崑在警察局裏就自認和他口角動武，無心把他翻下樓去，因此才闖下這件禍事的，此刻還在局子裏留着，最早也得侯到沈麻子傷愈之後才能出來。</p>
<p>大家聽了這消息，少不得又是一陣議論，直到天亮天散才散；秋海棠只是垂頭喪氣的坐在牀沿上，一句話也說不出來。</p>
<p>「老　二這個禍可闖得真不小！」趙四　房裏的人一散完，便勉强打起精神來，把他那一條肥胖的身軀，移到貼近秋海棠的一把椅子上去，竭力壓低了聲音說：「沈麻子那些徒弟和他家裏的人，看來都不是好東西！方才當着我們，已經口口聲聲的說，要把這一次所有的損失全算在你一個人頭上。我們的行頭，不用說是是給他們扣定了；而在沈麻子的傷沒有治好以前，別說趙玉崑揷翅難飛，便是連你也不見得走得成咧！」　（四二）</p>
<h3>溜冰的「神話」</h3>
<p>— 鐘子芒</p>
<p>天氣很陰冷，正是個溜冰的時節。</p>
<p>可是僅剩的幾個溜冰塲裏，人頭寥落，門票只扯去幾張，倒是隔壁的舞塲裏蓬拆蓬拆來得熱鬧。</p>
<p>這，不覺想到一兩年以前——</p>
<p>那時，上海的仕女們溜冰若狂，把舞塲改作溜冰塲的投機的老闆不計其數，也居然裝以美化的燈光，旁邊再設立「咖啡座」之類，完全是舞塲的作風，竟有「伴游」的「冰女」出現了。</p>
<p>一些商店裏一面出清了溜冰鞋的存貨，一面再向外洋定購新的，可是還供應不及。</p>
<p>「摩登」的仕女們手提兩隻溜冰鞋比提一隻皮夾還要神氣。</p>
<p>那時，還有溜冰比賽，也居然產生了一些「溜冰明星」——照片登在雜誌的封面，電影明星也只好白白眼睛——是的，有着溜冰的特刋，小型報。</p>
<p>這真奇怪，夏天原不是溜冰的時節，可是游泳池前「門可羅雀」，都擠在溜冰塲裏去兜風，汗珠不是沒有的，幸虧溜冰塲裏有的有冷氣，電風扇，那些仕女們很努力的溜着，有時喘息着：「boy來一杯冰凍橋子汁……」</p>
<p>麥管抽着，可是吊着鐵塊的脚是沉重的。</p>
<p>在溜冰塲的欄杆旁有些太太在學着溜冰是那麽的刻苦，汁水濕透了喬其紗的旗袍，有時忽而從前一撲朝後一仰滑了一個大交，可是仍很高興的溜着。……</p>
<p>在溜冰塲還舉行着賽跑跳舞，化裝的游戲……</p>
<p>宋雅海妮成了個摩登仕女崇拜的偶像，我記得有過一篇「東方的宋雅海妮」的訪問記。</p>
<p>「摩登」仕女們不管寒熱，在光滑的地板上溜着，旋着，滾着……</p>
<p>可是現在呢？</p>
<p>溜冰塲的四周也佈置得十分的馬虎，好像是另一批人，不再看見那些「摩登」仕女了——然而這正是一個溜冰時節。</p>
<p>想到過去溜冰熱，我好像讀到一則「神話」之類。</p>
<p>但同時，我發現了這都市的流行症。</p>
<p>學徒們的期望　享耳</p>
<p>凡是看過本月十四日本刋那篇「吃徒弟飯」的人，都會想到做徒弟的人底被人壓榨的痛苦。他們旣無薪金，還要受打罵，甚至連做徒弟的期限也要被延長——這都是師父們「生財有道」的手法——然而做徒弟的人們全部忍受了這一切的內心的悲哀，他們正等候着期待着那唯一的希望——徒弟的期滿，——變成一個夥計呢。</p>
<p>做夥計是徒弟們的成功，不但有少量的薪金，並且老板——以前的師父——待他們也客氣得多了；但是從徒弟成了夥計，人的年紀大啦，責任大，慾望需要也大；父母要養，小家庭也要組織，單靠着這小小的薪金怎能够呢？</p>
<p>然而這時有些聰明的老板是特別肯幫忙的。今年不够用，借給你明年的薪金，今月不够用借給下月的薪金，這樣一年一年的下去夥計在生意上的經騐才能確　驚人的發展。可是薪金仍舊不能增加，倘若這時換一個同行店家去做，的確可得一筆　厚的報酬。</p>
<p>可憐現在的夥計失去了自由，任意換主人更不可能了。因為他的債務也一年一年跟着他的身體·經騐·才能一樣的增高得那麽的驚人。</p>
<p>這時，夥計——徒弟變成的夥計依然故我，他大槪可以明瞭以前主人的客氣，幫忙了。——豈非又是「生財有道」的又一手法嗎？</p>

<h3>平劇丑角十傑</h3>
<p>— 英</p>
<p>自劉趕三，德子杰，黃三雄，羅百歲等相繼病歿，庸材如王長林，郭春山，慈瑞泉，蕭長華，遂稱雄於丑行，人材零落，於斯可鑑；近三十年來，又無繼起人物，茲擇今之丑行十名，成此「平劇丑角十傑」。</p>
<p>（一）郭春山　郭春山為北方丑行戲包袱，崑亂兼擅，年紀亦已不小，看過劉趕三與黃三雄，配過錢金福唱「醉打山門」；北方大堂會中，常約郭唱「回營」，「打車」，資望不下於已故之王長林，曹二庚，孫盛武等皆列其門牆。去年隨馬連良南來，（專為馬照顧新劇塲子）曾為上海戲曲學校說過一齣崑戲「回營」「打車」，總論其藝，不如南方周五　。</p>
<p>（二）慈瑞泉　是民初與王長林並峙的丑角，因王幫上楊小樓，余叙岩，地位遂壓倒瑞泉·長林長於武，而拙於袍帶戲；瑞泉不擅武工，但兼能方　戲；故當時大堂會中，長林必為配「小放牛」，「翠屛山」，「連環套」；瑞泉常唱「連陞店」，「羣英會」。其實慈之袍帶戲，亦非其長；「能仁寺」之賽西施，在內行中極負盛名。</p>
<p>（三）蕭長華　在民初地位本不如王，慈，自加入梅蘭芳班，漸為人所注意。此人長袍戲較短衣可取，嗓子比郭，慈亮而脆，「羣英會」之蔣子翼，「審頭刺湯」之湯勤，「連陞店」之店主，「法門寺」之賈桂，「打姪上墳」之朱倉等，皆為蕭傑作。長華為富連成主要敎習，故富社出身後輩弟子，皆以師尊事之，有子藝名盛萱，亦富社坐科弟子，工丑，藝宗乃父。</p>
<p>（四）馬富祿　曾師長林，後又拜過傅小山，能文能武，近十年來，鑑於武丑不為內行所重，專工文丑；而拙於方巾，故每演「烏盆計」張別古，「御碑亭」德祿，「法門寺」賈桂，精采百出，為近伶所不及；偶飾「審頭刺湯」湯勤，「打嚴嵩」嚴僕，「金玉奴」金松，「翠屛山」潘老丈，便覺身上臉上，無一似處。　祿嗓極宏亮，能串「美人計」「雁門關」老旦，「渭水河」「法門寺」花臉。</p>
<p>（五）賈多才　在近伶中亦屬老角，此人丑婆子戲較有好處，藝宗　世恭祖父遲子俊，學遲比子俊門徒小壽山為優，「能仁寺」賽西施不在慈瑞泉之下。</p>
<p>（六）茹富蕙　富蕙之藝，方巾力學蕭二順（長華），小丑戲身上　氣又優於馬富祿，嗓亦不弱，循規蹈炬，是其好處，因不喜媚俗，故外行座客多喜富祿而捨富蕙，此茹之名所不及馬也。</p>
<p>（七）曹二庚　曹郭徒，小丑戲較佳，其人宜扮鄕愚，天真二行脚色，嗓子神氣皆有可取，久隨程硯秋，「金鎖記」張驢兒，「硃痕記」衙役，皆傑作也。</p>

<h3>「鴛鴦刧」</h3>
<p>— 程冰奴</p>
<p>「鴛鴦刧」是英國文豪高爾斯華綏的名署，原名為The　First　and　The　Last現在搬上銀幕，變成了21Days　Togather（廿一天在一起），倒也相當動人，主演此片的是「亂世佳人」費文麗，和「蝴蝶夢」男主角勞倫斯奧立羅，成績自佳妙。</p>
<p>此片雖然不脫好萊塢一般愛情劇的典型，但主題却並不是戀愛至上，高爾斯華綏主張人道，他極力抨擊一個意圖嫁禍他人的紳士，（在片裏，他是勞倫斯的哥哥）他把劇中的主人公勞倫斯寫成一個不願為愛情而出賣良心的人，所以當他知道那個無辜被捕的失意牧師被法律判決有罪的時候，他便整日愁眉不展，如坐針氈，顧不得哥哥的勸告和哥哥的前程，他決要去自首，因為勤勒斃他愛人費文麗的前夫的，並不是那個牧師，而是他自己呀。</p>
<p>故事的發展，非常有力，從開塲勞倫斯倍着費文麗回家去起，中間經過勒斃，逃　，法庭聽審等一直到牧師被判決二十一日後行刑止，真如抽蕉剝　，一步緊一步。接着勞倫斯決意於這短促的二十一日之內，和費文麗盡量狂歡，準備於牧師行刑前去自首，劇情到這裏似乎又是一　，畫面上是二人狂歡的速寫，像「　潛服着的炸彈，到　綫燒到盡頭時，就要爆裂開來似的。」</p>
<p>二十一日是短促的一剎那便已過去；勞倫斯想着那个可憐的牧師，他決意前去自首。畫面上我們見到的是勞倫斯大踏步走到法庭去，費文麗緊緊地跟在他的後頭，他們穿過擁擠着行人的街道，撥開那些熙來攘往的行人，勞倫　越走越快，費文麗看看跟不上了，這時街上有人喊聲報的，說是那個牧師在獄中已經病斃了。費文麗看了報紙，格外慌張，生怕勞倫斯已經走到法庭，於是緊緊追趕，終於在最後一刻，在法院門口給她趕上，告訴他牧師已死，自首成了多餘；劇情如萬馬奔騰，到這裏才一把拉住，而觀眾在心裏急得卜卜跳之餘，也算鬆了一口氣，導演者處理這一高潮，可謂極盡奔騰澎湃的能事，每個觀眾的情緒，都給他緊緊地控制着。</p>
<p>費文　的演技，一貫地細膩動人，較之「亂世佳人」，又自成一格；勞倫斯沉毅果敢，恰合劇中人身份，自屬佳作。</p>

<h3>Regarding the Great Future of China, Mr. Currie Expresses Strong Confidence; Accompanied by Commissioner DePrez, He Left Chongqing by Plane for Hong Kong Yesterday Afternoon; Issued a Statement Upon Departure Expressing Gratitude to All Parties</h3>
<p>Chongqing  Mr. Currie, the personal representative of U.S. President Roosevelt, has now completed his mission in China. On the afternoon of the 27th, he and Economic Commissioner DePrez flew to Hong Kong on a CNAC plane, and will take the Clipper back to the United States on the 2nd of next month. Those who went to the airport to see him off before his departure included Mr. Lu Bian, the representative of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Minister He, and Deputy Chief of Staff Bai, as well as Deputy Prime Minister Kung, Mr. Duan Maolan, the representative of Foreign Minister Wang, and many American expatriates. Currie shook hands with Deputy Prime Minister Kung and others (and) was reluctant to part. Currie issued a written farewell speech before his departure, saying, "As I bid farewell to Chongqing, I would like to express my deep gratitude to all parties for their warm hospitality towards myself and Mr. DePrez. I am also grateful to the various ministries and commissions of the government for their assistance in providing various reference materials, which facilitated our work. All the personnel of the various agencies have worked extremely hard to assist us in our work. I would especially like to ask the press to convey our gratitude." He also said, "This trip to China has been a memorable experience for me, and my confidence in the great future of China has been confirmed before my return." In addition, Mr. Currie gained ten pounds during his twenty-day stay in Chongqing, which is proof of his pleasant stay. Mr. Currie has stated that he will not make any statements about his time in Chongqing until he has met with President Roosevelt to report back. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Hosts Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>Chongqing  Dr. Currie, the personal envoy sent by President Roosevelt to China, and Dr. TeSpree, the economic expert of the U.S. government, will take a CNAC plane to Hong Kong today, and then transfer to a Clipper to return to San Francisco. The Vice Minister of the Propaganda Department</p>
<p>Chongqing  As Roosevelt's representative, Currie, is about to leave Chongqing, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek hosted a banquet for him last night to see him off and had a long talk. It is reported that Mr. Currie expressed his utmost satisfaction with this trip. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Director Dong Xianguang and Major Max, the U.S. Naval Attaché to China, also accompanied Dr. Currie and others to Hong Kong. Finance Minister Kung Hsiang-hsi and representatives from other ministries also came to the airport to see them off. A reporter from the United Press asked Dr. Currie whether he would visit Shanghai before returning to the United States. The doctor replied, "There is not enough time. We will return directly to our country." Before his departure, Dr. Currie gave the press a written statement, saying that he would not make any further statements until he had met with President Roosevelt. Dr. Currie and others were carrying more than ten wooden boxes, all of which contained gifts for President Roosevelt and U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also handed Currie a scroll of calligraphy written in his own hand to be delivered to President Roosevelt. What was written on it is unknown. When Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi arrived at the airport, the plane had already started to move, but an Italian soldier waved a red flag to make it return to its original position. Dr. Currie and Mr. TeSpree also got off the plane again to shake hands with Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi. Dr. Kung told them that he had deliberately arrived late so that they would stay a little longer. Three minutes later, when the plane was about to take off again, U.S. Ambassador Johnson also arrived at the Yangtze River bank. Ambassador Johnson did not call for the plane to stop again; he merely stood on the bank of the river and watched the plane take off. According to an employee of China National Aviation Corporation, it was the first time in Chongqing that a plane had repeatedly stopped after starting. Dr. Currie looked very happy at the airport, shaking hands and chatting with everyone. Currie was wearing a black suit and a grey coat, without a hat, and a navy blue scarf with white dots.

<h3>Japanese Army Establishes Naval Supply Station in Dapeng Bay; Also Building an Airfield on Land; Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Achieves Another Victory</h3>
<p>Guilin The Japanese are recently developing Dapeng Bay as a naval supply station and building an airfield on land with an area of more than 200 mu, which is about to be completed. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing A Chinese military spokesman recently stated that there have been sporadic contacts on various battlefields this week, but the scale is not large, and there have been no significant advances or retreats on either side. Only the Chinese army on the Pinghan Railway has successively recovered Queshan, Paomaling, and other places. As for the Japanese army's preparations for advancing south in South China, they are progressing quite actively. Naval and army supply stations have been established in the Dapeng Bay area, and fortifications are being built along the coast of Hainan Island. A large number of Japanese warships are also concentrated in Yulin Port. (Havas Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing Military News: (1) More than 2,000 Japanese troops from Heilongguan, Chaidianzhen, Liucun, and other places in southwestern Shanxi Province advanced towards Tianjiagou (southwest of Heilongguan) and Yukou (northwest of Xiangling) in several directions on the 25th. They were severely attacked by the Chinese army along the way, and many Japanese were killed. The Chinese army is now encircling and attacking the remaining Japanese troops. (2) A certain unit of the Chinese army in southern Shanxi attacked the Japanese army in Quxucun, south of Quwo Jian. They stormed into the village and killed more than a hundred Japanese, and completely burned down the Shengchang cigarette shop established by the Japanese army. The remaining Japanese retreated to Quwo. (3) The Japanese army in Huimin, Shanghe, Qingcheng, Deping, and other places in northern Shandong Province had fierce battles with the Chinese army and were repelled. A total of 17 battles, large and small, resulted in more than 1,000 Japanese officers and soldiers killed or wounded, and a large amount of military supplies such as rifles, helmets, and horses were seized.

<h3>China Determined to Fight to the End to Deal With Any Eventuality; China Indirectly Fighting for the United States; Joint Sino-British Defense Plan Under Consideration</h3>
<p>New York Top Chinese sources have confirmed that no matter what happens, China is determined to continue fighting. According to the program of resistance and national reconstruction outlined by Foreign Minister Wang Chong-hui, it will depend on the amount of assistance received from the United States, which must include aircraft, artillery, tanks, weapons, and financial aid (loans have reached US$259,000,000 since 1930). At the same time, because Japan is determined to fight to the end unless China accepts a "reasonable peace," there is no hope of peace as long as the United States continues to aid China. The reinforcement of troops in Malaya is being closely watched. It is also said that Chinese officials are obtaining complete information on the situation in Malaya. It is also pointed out that once war breaks out between Britain and Japan, Britain would naturally welcome China's assistance. Because of this belief, various factions in China advocate a Sino-British joint defense agreement. (United Press Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>British China Relief Committee Attaches Importance to China's Position</p>
<p>London At a bi-weekly meeting of the China Relief Committee today, the committee discussed the important position of China in the tense situation in the Far East. The committee decided to send a telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek with the signatures of prominent British figures, expressing their hope to reiterate their past belief that China's united resistance and national reconstruction until complete victory and consolidated independence is an important factor in the peace and progress of the Far East and the world. The committee also decided to hold a national membership annual meeting at the Li Jiao Qi Dun Hall in London on February 29. Ambassador Guo Taiqi has agreed to deliver a speech at that time. The committee also discussed the official plan to specially declare in British newspapers the position of China in the Far East and the overall situation, and to urge the British government and the public to strengthen material assistance to China. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing The Central Daily News carried an editorial this morning, stating that China should participate in the joint defense of the South Pacific by the four powers of Britain, the United States, Australia, the Netherlands, and India, saying that if Japan launches an attack in the South Pacific, the war will not be limited to the navy. Its army has already entered the Shan Province (transliterated) of Burma, and in accordance with the agreement signed with the British government, it will help Britain defend Burma. A spokesman said that the news was absolutely untrue. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>The reasons why the United States continues to aid China can be listed as follows, according to top sources in Washington: The United States recognizes the Sino-Japanese War as part of the world war, one side being the Axis powers and the other being the democratic countries, which is related to the security of the United States itself. If the Axis powers win, the United States will encounter a strong enemy united against the United States in all aspects. At that time, the United States will have little hope of resisting it. If Japan defeats China, the interests of the United States in Asia will eventually be completely eradicated, because China is the one who resists the idea of ​​the Axis powers establishing a new world by force. Therefore, China's war is actually indirectly fighting for the United States. The Washington government officials acknowledge that the words of Yosuke Matsuoka in the Japanese Diet on January 21 are very accurate, that is, "the United States has a view that the first line of defense of the United States itself extends to China and the South Seas." The United States' support for China began before the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and its degree has increased day by day, until today, it has increased to only one step away from actual participation in the war. Among them, financial assistance includes a loan of US$290,000,000 for purchasing American cotton and wheat, US$25,000,000 for purchasing tung oil, US$20,000,000 for purchasing Chinese tin, US$25,000,000 for tungsten loan, US$50,000,000 credit for selling Chinese goods, US$50,000,000 for the stabilization fund, and US$60,000,000 for military materials. Among these amounts, China has repaid US$18,500,000. Observers believe that the use of various loans is extremely worthwhile, but critics believe that the current policy of aiding China is nothing more than a path to war. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing A spokesman for the Chinese government recently stated that China is considering a joint Sino-British defense plan for Yunnan, Burma, and Malaya. When asked whether it was true that China and Britain had signed an agreement on the joint defense of these three places, the spokesman said that technically speaking, it was a truth, but no agreement had yet been reached. But he also said that he could not say that this plan was not under consideration or study. Non-officials said that the Chinese government now considers it equally important for Britain to use Vietnam and Thailand as bases to threaten Burma. China will not sit idly by and watch Japan's southward advance, as this move will inflict a fatal blow on China's survival. Japan's launch in the South Pacific will also be a major move that benefits China, because the lives and property of the 10 million overseas Chinese currently living in the South Seas will be directly threatened. We must destroy this move before we can hope for final victory. Therefore, China must discuss the joint defense of the South Pacific with the related powers. (Reuters Dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and the Turbulent International Situation</h3>
<p>Recently, when discussing the future evolution of the international situation, we have repeatedly clarified the so-called center of gravity of the changing situation, and believed that it is necessary to grasp the center of gravity of the changing situation in order to see through the seemingly elusive phenomena. We have also tried to point out the center of gravity of the current situation. The so-called center of gravity is a term of physics. Throughout history, there have been many principles in physics that are applicable to domestic or international politics. Now, using the center of gravity to analyze how international turbulence is maintained, how it revolves, and how it tends to return, we firmly believe that it is easier to obtain an outline of the situation based on the center of gravity. However, the center of gravity of physics is not immutable, and there may be more than one center of gravity. If the center of gravity is reasonably shifted, even more infinite uses can be made. For example, military tanks can move up and down between hills and valleys without stumbling, which is the wonderful use of the center of gravity. When discussing international affairs, we call it the center of gravity because the possible shift of the international center of gravity cannot be discussed in a fixed way.</p>
<p>In today's international turmoil, although it is said that there are many clues and that it cannot be controlled by any one country, one thing, or one person, there is actually a key in between. Suppose, for example, that China has a question of whether to continue fighting, Britain's war has reached a critical point where it must either win a great victory or suffer a crushing defeat, the Soviet Union can no longer be ambiguous and must immediately express its support for the left or right, and the US war participation bill has been included in the congressional agenda for a vote. Of course, these are all assumptions and not realistic issues. However, the seriousness of the issues concerning these four countries is such that each one is sufficient to have a decisive effect on the entire international changing situation in turmoil. In comparison, whether or not Japan advances south and how the Balkans are safe have become minor issues. It can be seen that the so-called international center of gravity is indeed worthy of being re-examined at any time. In terms of the movements of the four countries, the Soviet Union is the most flexible.</p>
<p>On the eve of the outbreak of the European War, the Soviet Union was in a position of great importance. For more than a year, the world has only felt its unfathomable depth due to its silence. Recently, news about the Soviet Union has been coming in one after another, causing a great uproar. The most notable ones are: Firstly, in the Balkans, Bulgaria and Turkey are friendly to each other, and it is rumored that the Soviet Union is trying to win them over, but the Soviet Union denies that it has ever acted as an intermediary. Secondly, in addition to the extension of the validity period of the Japan-Soviet fishery agreement, Japan has stated that negotiations with the Soviet Union are proceeding smoothly; and it is said that economic compromises are the prelude to political understanding, and that relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are improving. Thirdly, it is reported from Washington, D.C., that American experts have confirmed that if a Japan-Soviet understanding is reached, the Japanese navy will have to deal with the United States; therefore, the decision on the issue of war and peace between the United States and Japan should depend on what actions Stalin of the Soviet Union will take in the near future. Fourthly, regarding the relationship between the Soviet Union and Germany, it is said that although the two countries are not fully satisfied, the Soviet Union is trying its best to avoid conflict with Germany, so it is willing to slightly condone Germany's activities in the Balkans. Fifthly, Germany's efforts to win over the Soviet Union and Japan are not a new topic; however, the United States has reported that Germany is also using the connection of the Soviet Union to mediate the Sino-Japanese war as an important step in this topic. All of this is real and unreal; assuming that the Soviet Union decides how to support the left or right, no one can imagine how severe and far-reaching its influence will be.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet Union's importance to the current international situation is conditional on "action". In other words, it is actually limited to the formation of a center of gravity in the turbulence and the exercise of its decisive influence only when it takes some important action. We take the liberty of making a deduction, believing that although the Soviet Union is truly prepared to smash any invading enemy, as it has repeatedly declared, it has no intention of selecting an enemy, participating in the war, and attacking it. Assuming that it participates in the war, it is a real force, but it does not participate in the war. It treats strong capitalist countries equally in principle. In its view, any country such as Britain, the United States, Germany, or Japan is no different from the others; but there are differences among them: in terms of history, geography, and ideology, Germany and Japan are the most hostile and dangerous to it, which cannot be denied for any reason. In terms of international relations, it and Germany were extremely close in the European War. From the German axis, a marriage of convenience with Japan is also possible; therefore, it has always maintained a relatively distant relationship with Britain and the United States. We have absolutely no reason to believe that the Soviet Union will disregard its founding hostility and danger and stand on the same front with Germany and Japan to engage in war against Britain and the United States. Its tolerance of Germany's activities in the Balkans is also limited to such a degree of tolerance, and it is by no means directly or indirectly helping Germany. Its dealings with Japan, on the one hand, take the policy of not changing its aid to China as a necessary prerequisite, and on the other hand, it has not seen through what Japan expects from the Soviet Union, that is, to make the Soviet Union change its policy towards China as the ultimate goal. Secondly, it is not to fight the United States necessarily and become friendly with the Soviet Union, but to obtain the freest and highest elasticity to threaten the United States by becoming friendly with the Soviet Union. To what extent the future of the Soviet-Japanese dealings can reach is unknown, but from the Soviet Union's deliberate tolerance of Germany in the West, we should not only imagine that it will take the same attitude in the East, but on the contrary, we should imagine that it will not relax in the East.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Negotiations Have Made No Progress; De Gaulle Convenes a Meeting; Participants are All Senior Military and Government Officials; Thailand-Vietnam Compromise Proposal Has Not Yet Been Answered</h3>
<p>Hanoi Lieutenant General De Gaulle, Governor of Vietnam, yesterday convened a meeting here with General Moltane, Commander of the Garrison, Dibo Tao, Commissioner of the Protectorate of Eastern Cambodia, Ge Langshang, Commissioner of the Protectorate of Northern Vietnam, and Dair Sarre, Secretary General of the Governor's Office, and Mang Duo Fani, Director of Political Affairs, to discuss the French response. Officials were unwilling to clarify whether their compromise proposal was the final or a temporary solution. However, according to observers, this is the final recommendation. When the Japanese side made this suggestion, there was a strict understanding that both the French and Thai sides must respond before Saturday. Of course, this includes Vietnam. Well-informed sources said that France's attitude towards the Tokyo negotiations has hardened. If the negotiations fail, the government will take certain precautions. Just as Vietnam expressed dissatisfaction with Japan, La Xi Folottier, Chairman of the Colonial Council of Cochinchina, published an article in the newspaper, saying that the Japanese attitude in the Tokyo negotiations is unnatural. Japan is not mediating, but dictating. La urged Vietnam not to accept Thailand's demands because Thailand's demands for territories in Laos and Cambodia are backed by Japan. French sources also believe that the rumored withdrawal of Japanese expatriates from Vietnam is a means by which Japan is forcing Vietnam to accept Thailand's demands. These sources also said that if Thailand did not have a third country behind it, it would not make demands. That is, some people in Thailand have said that Thailand's request to Vietnam and France's refusal, regardless of whether its request is justified, Thailand has regarded itself as the victor in this border war. The newspaper continued to say that Thailand has already claimed that Thailand's acceptance of Japanese mediation is to achieve its legitimate demands peacefully as it desires. Although it must be decided within a week whether Japan can propose a compromise condition that both parties must accept, the opinions of some Thai people seem to believe that a resumption of war is not absolutely impossible. The newspaper added that people should know that Japan is in a position of malicious manipulation in this Thai-Vietnamese incident. If it cannot achieve its ambitions through peaceful resolution, it may also be willing to see the resumption of war between Thailand and Vietnam. Thai has already arrived in Japan by plane and will arrive in Tokyo soon. It is reported that the Thai government is prepared to accept Japan's proposal and no longer make new demands, but on the condition that Vietnam shall not deliberately make things difficult when discussing the final resolution. (Haitong Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Chongqing The National Public News reported today that one of the demands made by Japan to French Vietnam was that Japanese instructors train 100,000 Annamese natives, and another was that the Japanese air force be allowed to use all airfields in Vietnam. (United Press Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Soviet-Thai Diplomatic Relations Expected to Be Restored</h3>
<p>Moscow The Soviet Union's Preparatory and National Long-term Trade People's Commissar expressed his gratitude for the sincerity of the reception from all parties during the negotiations. Montri is now on his way to Germany, and will return to Bangkok after arriving in Berlin. (Haitong Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in France in Dire Straits</h3>
<p>Chongqing, the Ta Kung Pao this morning carried a special dispatch, describing the suffering of Chinese in the German-occupied zone of France, stating that there are 30,000 Chinese in France. After the German army occupied Paris, they lost their jobs, but recently, most of them have found work again. Chinese merchants in France can be divided into two categories: (1) small vendors, (2) those who run restaurants. Small vendors are still able to find work due to the blockade and transportation difficulties.</p>
<h3>Doubts about Japanese Intentions; Malicious Manipulation of Thailand and Vietnam</h3>
<p>Singapore, the Singapore Free Press recently analyzed the situation in Thailand and Vietnam, asserting that Japan may hope that the Thai-Vietnamese war will reignite, so that it can implement interference. The newspaper said that the crux of the conflict is that if the war breaks out again, Japan can use the excuse of "protector" to implement non-peaceful interference. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Thai Ambassador Flies to Tokyo; Plans to Accept Japanese Recommendations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, after the negotiations ended, people here generally believe that the hope of restoring Soviet-Thai diplomatic relations is imminent. According to reports, Soviet-Thai diplomatic relations were severed in 1917 during the Bolshevik Revolution in the Soviet Union. Until the recent negotiations, Montreux left Moscow and said that the results of the preparatory negotiations were quite satisfactory. While in Moscow, Montreux visited Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs [Molotov] several times. Restaurateurs are hit hard due to the shortage of rice. The sixteen restaurants set up by overseas Chinese in Paris recently asked the Chinese Consul-General to allow them to purchase four tons of rice per month, but so far, they have only received half of this amount. The 150 Chinese students are in even more difficult circumstances, with 50 being taken care of by the Sino-French University in Lyon, and the remaining 100 being extremely short of funds due to the disruption of remittances from abroad.

<h3>US President Convenes Meeting; Discusses Implementation of Lend-Lease Act; Senate Continues Heated Debate on Pros and Cons of the Bill; Expected to Pass This Weekend</h3>
<p>Washington, President Roosevelt convened two meetings yesterday to discuss the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act. In the morning, he met with Secretary of State Hull, Secretary of War Stimson, Undersecretary of the Navy Forrestal, Chief of Staff General Marshall, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark, which in essence is equivalent to a "Defense Cabinet." In the afternoon, he met with Hull, Forrestal, and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. After the meeting, he scheduled a meeting with Air Chief Marshal Dowding of the British Air Force and Hopkins, who had just returned to the US from England, to receive a direct report on the situation of the British Air Force. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington, the Senate continues to hotly debate the pros and cons of the Lend-Lease Act. Government officials are trying their best to get the bill passed on Saturday. Republican Senator Nye of North Dakota attacked the bill, saying that Britain is using financial strikes to seek free assistance from the United States, and ridiculed the idea that Hitler would be able to attack the United States after destroying Britain. Another leader of the isolationists, Wheeler (Democrat of Montana), said that President Roosevelt violated neutrality. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Washington, Senate Democratic leader Barkley said, "As long as the European war does not stop," Congress will not adjourn, and urged the Senate to pass the Lend-Lease Act as soon as possible. He also said, "The whole world is at war, regardless of whether we are belligerent or not, the outcome of the war is inevitable." President Roosevelt told reporters that the first task of the United States "is to assist in the war effort. Without achieving this fundamental goal, there can be no peace." Senator Wheeler, a non-interventionist, said that the President's words were "shocking." (International News Service dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Washington, the House Appropriations Committee yesterday released the discussions of the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and Navy in Congress. Army Chief of Staff Marshall believes that the current danger of aggression is not as serious as it was a year ago, saying that if the control of the Atlantic Ocean was in the hands of the enemy a year ago, the United States would be in a helpless position. Chief of Naval Operations Stark, in response to a question from a certain senator, said that President Roosevelt did not specify the time when the Navy should be prepared to act. The Navy Department is working on the basis of early preparation. The process of building ships is progressing very quickly. The construction of warships is four to six months ahead of schedule. In his personal opinion, Willkie's suggestion to transfer more destroyers to Britain does not seem appropriate at this time. However, the government's handling of this matter should not be restricted in any way, because in the current state of the world, it is impossible to predict what the United States wants to do tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, and a certain emergency may occur, causing the United States to transfer a certain war equipment to Britain.

<h3>Germany to Adopt Submarine Offensive Against Britain; Britain Expects Major War to Break Out in Less Than Two Months</h3>
<p>Washington, the International News Service learned from senior authorities here last night that Britain expects Germany to launch the largest sea, land, and air offensive ever seen in the next 60 days. It is said that Britain firmly believes that Hitler is preparing to attack on six fronts simultaneously. The British government believes that the British Isles, Ireland, Gibraltar, Greece, and British territories in Africa are highly likely to be attacked by Germany at the same time. It is said that since German mechanized troops landed in Africa and the "wolf pack" of German submarines claimed to have caused great destruction to British warships, the German offensive has already entered the preliminary stage. Hitler's recent speech warned Britain that a huge submarine offensive would force Britain to surrender or perish. What Hitler was referring to was this "wolf pack." According to people here, if the battle results of these "wolf packs" transmitted by Berlin are credible, then the rate of British ships sinking is more harmful than the submarine threat in the last war that almost allowed Germany to win.

<p>London, a Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Cripps, going to Turkey is a logical result of the British Foreign Secretary's visit to Turkey, because the relationship between Turkey and the Soviet Union is extremely close.

<h3>Soviet Budget Committee Recommends Increased Budget: Deputies Engage in Heated Debate, Unanimously Supporting National Defense Spending</h3>
<p>Moscow - The first session of the Soviet Supreme Council's eighth convocation of the Union Council continued yesterday morning. Ms. Nikolaeva, representative of the Union Council's Budget Committee, presented a supplementary report on the 1941 budget and the implementation of the 1939 budget. She stated that the Budget Committee found the budget submitted to the Council acceptable, as it was drafted in accordance with the national economic plan, and that the methods used by the People's Commissariat for disbursing funds were also rational. However, the Budget Committee recommended that the Council slightly amend the budget, increasing revenue by 990 million rubles and expenditure by 272.5 million rubles. In other words, the Council should revise the 1941 budget to 216,840,221,400 rubles in revenue and 216,052,224,000 rubles in expenditure. At the same time, it should retroactively approve the implementation of the 1939 budget (156,013,908,000 rubles in revenue and 153,299,045,000 rubles in expenditure). Thereupon, the deputies began to debate. Deputy Konievich stated, "The Council should immediately approve the national defense budget. We are extremely pleased with the victories of the Red Army, but we must not be complacent. The combat strength of the Red Army and Navy must be further expanded.

Deputy Pylonsky stated, "Soviet Belorussia has made great progress in economic and cultural development. The expansion of industry in western Belorussia is particularly noteworthy. In 1940, the region's industrial output increased by 15 percent. There have also been achievements in agriculture. In 1940, 68,000 hectares of land have been irrigated, of which 40,000 hectares have begun cultivation.

Mr. Kaftanov, Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Higher Education, stated that the 1941 budget included a very large cultural development plan. In 1940, the Soviet Union established 40 new institutions of higher education. There were 600,000 students studying at 781 institutions of higher education. In 1940, 100,000 experts completed their studies. In addition, there were 1,500 Soviet scientific institutions. The 1941 budget stipulates 165.1 million rubles for the development of science. The Soviet intelligentsia are determined to do their utmost to ensure the implementation of the national economic plan, thereby strengthening the Soviet Union's national strength. Mr. Kostubekov subsequently spoke extensively about the development of the Azerbaijan Republic, stating that "the region is developing rapidly in the cultural sphere. In 1941, the budget for health protection is set at 65 million rubles. The region has 3,500 primary and secondary schools with 650,000 students. The region also has 66 scientific institutions. The 1941 construction budget for municipal administration and housing reaches 64 million rubles. The region's poetry, literature, and music are renowned throughout the world. The Soviet government is determined to assist the people of the region in developing their talents." In addition, Deputies Ibalamov and others participated in the debate. (TASS dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>The Impact of Pain on Society</h3>
<p>Pain sometimes gives us a lot of trouble. When we have a slight headache, we can make the wrong decisions, and suffer serious losses in our business. If in meetings we are unable to express our opinions. As for the social world, it is even more damaging. When making arrangements, we have to cancel our appointments at the last minute.</p>
<p>Pain is also not allowed in the home. If a housewife suffers from menstrual pain, then the family life is full of suffering, the children are just messing around, and when the husband returns home, he sees his wife lying in bed, showing infinite boredom. Therefore, pain is enough to affect our physical health, and indirectly enough to affect the safety of the whole society.</p>
<p>However, we do not have to endure pain, because as long as we take one or two tablets of Saridon, the pain will stop within ten minutes, and is absolutely safe. No matter which part has any kind of pain, Saridon is the supreme panacea.</p>

<h3>Grain: High Prices Attract Zhaoyuan Goods; Ample Supply of Thick and Thin Japonica Rice; Imported Rice Still Dominates with Only Sporadic Offerings</h3>
<p>Imported rice has been in a situation of "market with no goods" recently, for almost a week. There are rumors that the authorities are going to thoroughly investigate the inventory and force sales, "but like a loud staircase with no one coming down, not only is the stalemate difficult to break, but it is also getting worse day by day. Yesterday, there were still no goods on the market. What was offered was only the returned 85 yuan for No. 1 Siamese rice, 72 yuan for the second-grade rice, and 67 yuan for the second-grade broken tips. The rest was still only the original English-Chinese company packages from the road." It is unknown when this phenomenon will be eliminated. But the thought that these people are holding onto the spot goods, putting the people's food behind their minds, is nothing more than wanting illegal profits. However, holding on until now, the most affected are the general rice shops. Because they are suffering from not being able to purchase goods, and also have to deal with retail sales. In the situation of only output and no input, the store's stock is getting thinner and thinner, and they will secretly raise prices, sell inferior goods at high prices, and mix in large quantities of crushed rice. Those who suffer are still the majority of people without a stone of storage for overnight food. In fact, investigating hoarding is not difficult. If there is a willingness to avoid忌, and no determination to eliminate harm for the people, thousands of investigations will not produce any results. It is faintly heard that the Shantou gang has received 6,600-6,700 bags of Saigon rice, which will arrive in Shanghai in three or four days, and will be sold in the market at a limited price of 84 yuan and 8 jiao. More rice is arriving and is also being negotiated. It is expected that on the market today and tomorrow, even if the hoarders do not care about the life and death of the public, they will have no way to use their skills. Returning period rice is sold open at 99 yuan for No. 1 Saigon for February, 91 yuan 3-4 jiao to 91 yuan 5 jiao for small 絞 for February, 91 yuan 2 jiao for small for March, 80 yuan for crushed rice for March and April, 79 yuan 8 jiao for February and March, totaling 800 tons. Spot rice is 2,000 bags, road goods are 6,600-6,700 bags. The market transaction has gradually become lively, it is said.</p>
<p>Due to the repeated soaring prices on the market, merchants of thick and thin Japonica rice and other domestic rice have considerable profits, and are happy to transport it, resulting in a relatively strong source. At the same time, sales are slightly slack due to the sufficient price increase, causing the cargo owners to have a shout for higher prices, but it is difficult to achieve their wishes. As a result, the situation is stable, and the selling prices are similar to the previous ones. If Kunshan斛粳 is still 108 yuan to 106 yuan, Qingjiao thin稻斛 sees 104 yuan half, 104 yuan.</p>
<p>Among other goods that are running, glutinous rice is uniquely unrestricted. Therefore, general merchants are all using glutinous rice on the market, so what is filling the market is all glutinous rice. However, glutinous rice is a supplementary product. It has a narrow market, so how can it be sold in such large quantities? Due to uneven supply and demand, the market is soft, and the selling price continues to depreciate by yuan. Hong Kong special团粒 glutinous rice is 89 yuan to 88 yuan, long grain is from 87 yuan 2 jiao high, to 85 yuan 4 jiao low, and glutinous lu is 80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Talking about Rice Reserves: Observing the Rice Market</h3>
<p>The current amount of rice reserves in Shanghai is very large, enough to supply residents for six months of consumption. Private storage is not even included. Food panic is certainly not to be worried about, but prices are still difficult to fall. In 1939, Shanghai imported a total of 45,765 tons of imported rice, with a total value of about 1,441,000 US dollars. Vietnam and Thailand each supplied 22,500 tons, most of which was imported at the end of the year, about 36,000 tons. In 1940, Shanghai imported 392,225 tons of imported rice, averaging 32,000 tons per month, of which 269,000 tons came from Vietnam, 98,000 tons came from Thailand, and 21,200 tons came from Burma. The purchase price totaled 14,000,000 US dollars. The results are not only that rice prices have soared, making them unaffordable for the general public, but also that the increase in imports requires a huge amount of foreign exchange, which is precisely to promote the devaluation of legal tender, and purchasing power is reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>In 1940, the turnover of importers of imported rice was dozens of times higher than in the previous year, and the profits were self-evident. More than 40 to 50 rice firms undertake sales, and then resell to more than 500 rice shops. After repeated sales, the price has become expensive by the time it reaches the consumer. As a result, people in the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors have speculated in rice, just like those engaged in speculation in cotton yarn and other goods. As a result, a huge amount of rice and grain has left the market and is hoarded in warehouses, held on without selling. If rice produced in the interior can be transported to Shanghai, rice prices will inevitably plummet, and those engaged in speculating in rice and grain will be punished. However, according to the Financial and Commercial Report, in addition to supplying the Japanese army, the amount of rice exported to Japan from the interior last year reached 700,000 tons, and it is estimated that the amount exported this year will be over 1 million tons. It is a well-known fact that Japan lacks rice and foreign exchange. The rice imported from the Chinese interior can be paid in Japanese currency without having to use foreign exchange. This move is of the utmost importance. Considering this need and the 400,000 tons consumed annually by the Japanese army in China, it can be predicted that the amount of rice imported into Shanghai from the interior this year cannot exceed that of 1940.</p>
<p>The amount of rice imported into Shanghai from the interior last year was about 30,000 to 40,000 tons, which is extremely small compared to the actual consumption of Shanghai. However, in recent months, the amount of imports has decreased significantly. This is固 as a result of the above-mentioned reasons, and is because of "bamboo joint control"去矣. Although there are rumors that at least 14,000担 of domestically produced rice will be supplied to the concessions every month, in fact, power is not 伊操, how can it be realized? Moreover, this number is only enough for one and a half days of consumption for Shanghai residents, and its relationship with the entire market is very small. Now domestic rice is very expensive, no different from being enjoyed exclusively by wealthy families. The supply and demand situation of Shanghai's food in 1940 is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Imported Rice Imports 392,225 tons</p>
<p>Domestic Rice Supply 40,000 tons</p>
<p>Total 432,225 tons</p>
<p>Consumption 290,000</p>
<p>Remaining Reserves 142,225 tons</p>
<p>The above figure for the supply of domestic rice is based on market records, which is an approximate number, but it can be determined that it cannot exceed 40,000 tons. As for the additional sales of private transfers, although the details are not easy to know, its quantity is too small to be of any importance.</p>
<p>What must be known is that the amount of rice consumed by Shanghai residents usually does not exceed 22,000 tons per month, and there is a tendency to gradually decrease. The reason is that half is due to the soaring price of rice, and naturally there is节缩 or a change to eating miscellaneous grains, and half is due to the increasing number of residents leaving the two concessions. Therefore, the remaining reserves of 141,225 tons at the end of last year will not be shaken, and the imported rice that was imported in January and February of this year will be no less than 60,000 to 70,000 tons. It can be seen that there is a lot of imported rice in Shanghai, but the market is like this. 囤积居奇者之肉, 寗足食耶 (Lin)</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Road Goods Are About to Arrive</h3>
<p>As the flour is about to arrive, the foreign wheat ordered by Chinese factories will also arrive at the same time. Merchant囤積心思冷淡, but 囤戶 believes that the current stock of現粉 is lacking, and before the arrival of the huge amount of途貨, they are still unwilling to compromise too much. Therefore, the market has been in a stalemate. In the morning, 500 bags of Blue Wheat Flower Brand foreign flour were sold, at a price of 25 yuan 8 jiao to 7 jiao half. The evening market loosened by a few points, but the high-end flour, Beautiful Brand, is still firm due to lack of goods. Chinese factory平賣粉 is still sold at 23 yuan for thousands of bags, all purchased by designated merchants.</p>
<p>Due to the increasing産價 of wheat, the source of purchase in the interior is dwindling. It is not easy for each factory to supply raw materials. Although the Japanese factory门市 has released prices, it is also without goods to receive. Chinese factories are waiting for foreign wheat to assist, and the limit for this wheat is still 40 yuan, but the market喊价 has reached 42-3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Can't Afford to Eat Rice, Switch to Eating Corn</h3>
<p>Selling No Less Than 700,000 to 800,000 Bags</p>
<p>Since rice prices have risen without falling, the people's food in various villages and regions mostly relies on various coarse grains mixed with food. Therefore, corn (that is, pearl rice) (bagu) (yu shuli) has a very lively market. Shanghai Port is still a hub for transshipment, so the miscellaneous grain market feels more prosperous. Saigon corn, whether for delivery or spot, has large entries and exits. General insiders and outsiders and speculators, because of the Saigon area being under the shroud of the world war, make the market price fluctuations quite huge. No less than 700,000 to 800,000 bags of goods have been sold before and after. At the moment, there are also about 200,000 bags in stock and not yet arrived. Because the city has destinations in North China, Central China, and Zhejiang Province, its涨风 is as fierce as rice prices. Yesterday's market rose first and then fell, but the result still exceeded the previous market. According to statistics, more than 2,000 bags of Saigon現苞米 were traded, and 200 tons were delivered in February. The market conditions are detailed in the price column. This city also has corn flour for sale at a price of 2 jiao 7-8 fen per catty.</p>
<p>Also on the 28th, 460 bags of beans were exported to Hong Kong, and another 170 bags were exported to Haikou. 14,400 pieces of bean cake were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Finance The US Dollar Gushes Out</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listing. The British and American exchange rates in the unofficial market opened slightly soft in the morning, but the trend remained uncertain thereafter. British and American banks were eagerly absorbing US dollars, while Chinese banks were unanimously selling them off, mainly in US dollars. Consequently, the market showed a slight hardening. However, the advance order saw a tightening, closing at 3/8 390625 in the afternoon. Later, news spread that China and the United States had signed an agreement, causing nervousness in the market. Speculators then began selling, and Japanese banks also released dollars, leading to a potentially loosening trend. Currently, the trading price for the US dollar is 5.59375 yuan, a decrease of 0.015615 compared to the previous day, while the forward US dollar is up 0.03125.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Sell Hong Kong Electricity</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London big bar (gold bar) was stable for the near term, with a drop of 0.0625 for the long term. The New York silver price was flat, and the London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was stable, with a slight decrease of one cent against Shanghai and no market against France. The central government's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning: British gold at 3/8 390625 and US dollars at 5.53125 yuan. Compared to the closing prices of the previous evening, the British pound was down 0.0325, and the US dollar was up 0.03125. After the opening, Chinese banks were the first to sell, and British banks also sold when profitable, resulting in a stable market. The selling price of US dollars for March was 5.53125 yuan, all absorbed by MacGalli and HSBC. At 9:30 AM, the HSBC listing was announced, and all exchange rates remained unchanged. The white silver equalization tax showed no change. Thereafter, the market was uncertain, but foreign firms were selling. It is estimated that in February, a certain American bank absorbed US dollars reaching 5.5625 yuan. Later, due to speculators suddenly buying, the market remained unchanged despite the selling by Hong Kong merchants Dao Heng and Chinese banks. It is estimated that the US dollar for March was consistently traded at 5.53125 yuan. The afternoon closing price for spot US dollars was 5.5625 yuan, British pounds at 3/8 390625, and US dollars for the next month at 5.53125 yuan, British pounds at 3/8 375.</p>
<p>US Dollar Rises, British Gold Tightens</p>
<p>The market appeared deceptively loose in the afternoon because Chinese merchants and speculators were consistently selling. Japanese banks also sold, first selling this month's US dollars to foreign firms at 5.59375 yuan, and then March's US dollars at 5.5625 yuan. At the time, rumors spread that China and the United States had signed an agreement, causing market volatility. Later, a certain American bank also absorbed speculators' March US dollars at 5.5625 yuan. The market still closed firm, with spot US dollars at 5.59375 yuan and March at 5.5625 yuan. Both spot and March advance orders were at 3/8 40625, an increase of 0.03125 compared to the previous day's prices for both spot and forward US dollars.

<h3>Retail Investors Sell Off, Gold Market Declines Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold (cooked red) unofficial market suddenly plummeted. In the afternoon, due to rumors of a China-US agreement being signed and a rise in foreign exchange rates, market sentiment loosened, pushing the price down to within 6,200 yuan, reaching a low of 6,160 yuan. However, the market was very firm in the morning, opening at 6,300 yuan and rising to 6,310 yuan after the opening. Until the close of the morning session, despite significant fluctuations in between, the price remained at 6,267 yuan, supported by firms like Cheng Kee and Heng Kee. The afternoon started smoothly, but with the spread of the aforementioned news, Heng Kee and retail investors unanimously sold off, and the price decline began. Before the evening close, the price had fallen to 6,160 yuan, and the closing price was only 6,170 yuan, a decrease of 83 yuan compared to the previous day. The total trading volume for the day was over 30,000 taels. The spread (February to March) sellers paid out approximately 40 yuan. The cash price suddenly surged dramatically. Initially, Cheng Kee sold 120 taels to Xiang He at a premium of 460 yuan over the forward price. This gold firm then purchased over 500 more taels, and the securities firm De Fu purchased over 300 taels. Thus, by noon, Xiang Xing, Yong Jin, and Cheng Kee's 10 taels required a premium of 515 yuan. In the afternoon, buyers rushed in even more, and sellers hoarded, causing prices to soar even further. Yu Tai purchased 10 taels from Yong Cheng, reaching a premium of 600 yuan. Xiang He then purchased 50 taels each from Yong Cheng, Yu Xing, and Yong Jin at a premium of 980 yuan. Gold jewelry also rose by 10 yuan, reaching 590 yuan. Customs gold and other items remained flat.</p>
<p>Futures Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>Initially, due to bullish market sentiment, the trading floor was very active with buying at the opening, driving the price up to 6,300 yuan, an increase of over 40 yuan compared to the previous day. After the opening, the price rose another 10 yuan, reaching 6,310 yuan. Later, firms like Xin Feng, Yong De, De Fu, and Cheng Kee aggressively sold, causing the price to fall back to 6,255 yuan. However, Da Feng and Cheng Kee then initiated another buying spree, pulling the price back up to 6,310 yuan. Unfortunately, firms like Gong He, Cheng Kee, Da Feng, Xin Feng, and Yong then released gold again, and market sentiment appeared slightly uncertain. Thus, the market softened somewhat, falling to 6,235 yuan. Finally, with Heng Kee showing buying intentions and Cheng Kee also searching, the market gradually moved upwards, reaching 6,375 yuan. By the noon close, the price was reported at 6,267 yuan. The market opened flat in the afternoon, at 6,260 yuan. Ren Cheng, Yong Da Feng, Xin Hui, and Yong slightly bought, raising the price by five yuan, to 6,265 yuan. Later, due to rumors within the market about China and the United States signing an agreement and a hardening in the foreign exchange market, retail investors sold heavily, and Heng Kee aggressively dumped, pushing the price down to within the 6,200 yuan level, reported at 6,180 yuan. Later, thanks to a large Da Feng and others taking advantage of the low prices to replenish their holdings, the trend was stronger, and the price briefly returned to outside the 6,200 yuan level, reaching 6,320 yuan. However, the selling pressure then intensified again, dropping to 6,160 yuan, and the evening close was only 6,170 yuan, a decrease of 83 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 150 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold at cash gold firms was over 10 yuan higher than spot gold (cooked red), and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current benchmark gold price was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with little activity in opening positions.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Prices Rebound Greatly</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael was 690 yuan at 9:30 AM and 680 yuan at 2:40 PM. The price rebounded by 10 yuan at 3:00 PM. The result was that Da Tong Hang listed the price at 690 yuan, and the new Tong Hang's price was similar to the above, with the purchase price 30 yuan lower, it is said.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies High Then Low</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a drop in spot prices, but cash prices remained firm. Thus, British, American, and gold pounds only fell by one yuan each. American dollar bills rose and then fell. Initially, Da Tong's large purchases led to an increase to 9.2 cents, but the subsequent loosening of the black market US dollar caused a drop, eventually settling at 17 yuan and 7.2 cents, a decrease of three cents compared to the previous day. The supply of Hong Kong bills was slightly strong, and the market price was slightly weak. Japanese gold bills and Korean bills were both in demand, and the market prices continued to rise, with the former increasing to 1 yuan and 7.7 cents and the latter reaching 1 yuan and 4.3 cents.</p>
<h3>Securities Domestic Debt Remains Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for public bonds saw little activity in the morning because Xinfu temporarily stopped trading, and prices were slightly lower. In the afternoon, Xinfu resumed buying, and at the same time, Shunchang added to their long positions. Tong Shun, Xinhua, and Lianyi also bought, and prices rose slightly again, presenting a sideways trend. However, Ding Kang bought quite a bit in the morning, and Hong Da sold quite a bit. In the afternoon, Lian Tong and Kang sold. After the close, there was talk of a Sino-British-American economic alliance, and people saw stability. Changes are expected to come later, but for now, it's just sideways movement. However, the foundation is very firm, so caution is advised. The resulting market prices retreated slightly, falling five cents to one dime to three dimes. Type D and 96 bonds saw no activity. The total transaction volume was only about 1.4 to 1.5 million. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Most Similar Most Sideways Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Type A 73.80 72.40 73.60 Down 0.20</p>
<p>Type B 68.90 68.40 68.70 Down 0.75</p>
<p>Type C 66.10 65.55 65.75 Down 0.30</p>
<p>Type E 64.10 63.90 64.00 Down 0.30</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 51 yuan each.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the stock market at the Public Industry Association continued to weaken. The Yih Ho Cotton Mill share price fell significantly, opening at 44 yuan and later falling to 41.5 yuan at the close. International, Enterprise, and British United also declined, but their foundations remained stable. However, rubber stocks were quiet.</p>
<p>London, 26th (Wednesday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks were flat, with no changes in market prices.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn The Bulls Are Strong, With Slight Retreat in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market remained tight, and the bullish trend was strong. This was due to rumors spreading the previous day that the Municipal Council was conserving electricity, and cotton mills might reduce their work hours. Speculators took the opportunity to become active, and buying was unusually strong, so Shuang Ma (Double Horse brand) once jumped outside the 1,400 yuan mark, jumping over 100 yuan in the past two days. However, some of this was due to the rise in foreign exchange rates, the inability to sell current goods, and the low prices of mixed-brand yarns. Twenty-count Shuang Di Qiu (Double Globe brand) at 1,200 yuan was still not selling, 200 yuan cheaper than Shuang Ma. As a result, sellers released their positions outside the 400 yuan level, and the market was firm but with a softening trend. The highest price for twenty-count Shuang Ma was 1,416 yuan, and it was 1,386 yuan in the afternoon. Gold prices retreated in the afternoon, initially trading at 1,390 yuan, falling to 1,275 yuan, and the final price was 1,373 yuan. 220 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong on the 28th.</p>
<p>Shuang Ma opened in the morning, continuing the firm momentum of the afternoon of the previous day, and the bullish forces were particularly strong. The opening price was 1,400 yuan, immediately rising to 416 yuan. Traders then closed their positions for profit, falling back to 1,392 yuan. But the bulls did not give up, again going outside the 400 yuan mark. Later, hearing that gold prices had fallen and market sentiment had loosened, the price fell again to 1,388 yuan at the close. It was found that the turnover statistics for the half-day totaled 8,860 bales. The amount bought by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 350 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Total 8,500 Statistics 8,860</p>
<p>The current cotton situation is still calm, but there is news of factory reductions in work hours, making them less interested in purchasing raw cotton. In addition, cotton yarn sales are still scarce, so yarn prices are also uncertain.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market rose initially due to purchases by peers, then fell due to sales by spot traders and speculators, resulting in closing prices approximately 2-3 pounds lower than the previous day.</p>
<p>The Indian cotton market was very flat, due to small transaction volumes and no major changes in recent days. Yesterday, the forecast fell by about half a rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai's cotton yarn trading market, cotton mills seem to be deciding to reduce work hours, so the foreign cotton trade has also become quiet.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Factory Cloth Shows Little Change, Spot Eastern Piece Goods Have Few Buyers</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, prices first rose and then fell, due to volatile market sentiment. Prices first rose due to talk of reduced electricity supply, and then selling pressure caused prices to fall again due to talk of a Sino-US economic agreement. Fugui fine cloth opened at 43.75 yuan in the morning, an increase of 0.25 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, it was sold at 43.25 yuan. Overall, the prices of fine cloth and twill fabrics of various brands showed very little change compared to the previous day. Coarse cloth was firmer in the morning session but retreated in the afternoon. Transactions were not strong. Dyeing factories and hoarders on this street searched for and purchased over 400 pieces of coarse and fine grey cloth, and the Ningbo and Taizhou groups in eastern Zhejiang purchased 50-60 pieces of fine cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth. The Min and Guangdong groups purchased over 100 pieces of palace silk, colored cloth, bleached cloth, and other goods.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Market sentiment remained high. There was strong real demand for white cloth and fine cloth of mid-range brands, leading to a continued increase of 0.25-0.5 yuan per bolt. Two Dragons Head fine cloth was affected by the discovery of forged warehouse receipts, and buyers were scarce, causing it to fall by 0.25 yuan. Fine twill fabrics also rose by 0.25-0.5 yuan each. This is because dyeing and sales on this street have recently expanded, and inventories are gradually thinning.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea Shanghai Silk Exports Are Difficult, Market Sentiment Is Depressed</h3>
<p>Overseas silk prices have been gradually rising recently. Both New York and Yokohama's current goods have rebounded considerably. However, difficulties in exports have led to no improvement in foreign firms' silk stock prices in this port. Yesterday, only White Filature Silk 20-22 78/80 had some sales, priced at 4,950 yuan. The user market was also quiet, causing market sentiment to be depressed.</p>
<h3>Dried &amp; Sundry Goods Large Slices of Dried Longan Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Large slices of dried longan have been very scarce since the start of spring. Therefore, the firms holding stocks are defending them vigorously. The current release is small, but the market price has risen by over 20 yuan. However, demand is relatively scarce, and prices have reached their peak.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse White Down 7-8 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend weakened further, continuing to fall by 7-8 cents. The association's pricing: 24th grade coarse white foreign warehouse spot goods at 79.3 yuan to 79 yuan. Small 8-cent futures for next month's 20th-day delivery at 80 yuan to 79.5 yuan. Small 7-cent Taikoo car white B-mark west warehouse at 78.5 yuan. Small 6-cent east warehouse at 78.4 yuan to 78 yuan. DY-mark west warehouse at 77 yuan. HX-mark west warehouse at 76 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Inferior Coal Briquettes Reappear on the Market</h3>
<p>--They Neither Ignite Nor Burn Well--</p>
<p>The price of coal briquettes has always been either falling or flat. Although the open market is still stable today, competition among peers in the unofficial market is fierce, with price cuts regardless of cost. As a result, a few unscrupulous manufacturers, for the sake of business, often cut corners, mixing inferior dross with chimney ash to produce them. Their products neither ignite nor burn well. Shops, greedy for high profits, pass off the fake as genuine, and users secretly suffer losses. Therefore, it is hoped that the industry association will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Hardware The Company Iron Is Increasingly Expensive</h3>
<p>The price of company iron has been rising sharply in recent days. This is because, given the situation in the Pacific, the inventory in this city is likely to run out of stock. Therefore, those holding this commodity are extremely firm and unwilling to sell unless the price is excellent. As a result, canneries, toy factories, and printing factories are searching urgently to prevent a shortage of raw materials. Asking prices are soaring. Yesterday, 200-pound old steel factory iron was selling for 220 yuan, and new steel factory iron was selling for 215 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood Annan Shrimp Tails Decline</h3>
<p>The price of Annan shrimp tails has recently eased due to a slight increase in supply. Yesterday's market prices were: golden hook tails at 450 yuan, and Tianbian tails at 440 yuan to 430 yuan, about 20 marks lower than before.</p>
<h3>Economic Miscellany Different Forms of Numerals</h3>
<p>— By Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Numerals written as 壹, 貳, 叁, 肆, 伍, 陸, 柒, 捌, 玖, 拾, 阡, 陌, etc. The Ming dynasty's Lu Rong's "Shu Yuan Za Ji" states that "it began with Kai Ji, the Minister of the Ministry of Justice, at the beginning of the Ming dynasty, but the Song dynasty's Bian Shi's 'Kun Shan Zhi' already had them. It is said that the numbers on coins and shells used the original characters, so criminals could easily steal and alter them, hence these were changed to prevent fraud." According to Lu Rong, who was from Kunshan in the Ming dynasty, what he said reflects the reasons why Ming people adopted this type of numeral, but there are already varying opinions. Cha Shenxing of Haining in the Qing dynasty, in his "De Shu Lou Za Chao", has a more detailed study, saying:</p>
<p>"In ancient books, one was written as 弌, two as 弍, and three as 弎, probably using 弋 as the base, and one, two, and three were attached to form the characters. It is not known when the single stroke of one as 一 and other numerals started. Cheng Dachang's "Yan Fan Lu" says: 'Nowadays, government documents use similar-sounding characters with more strokes to record numbers, so they cannot be altered for illicit purposes.' Gu Yanwu said that the numerals 壹, 貳, 叁, 肆, etc., were all changed by Empress Wu Zetian. Hong Rongzhai's 'Sui Bi' says: 'Ancient books and the Han people used one and 壹, two and 貳, three and 叁, with the same meaning.'"</p>
<p>According to Gu Yanwu's statement, there must be a basis. Wu Zetian often changed the characters, such as using "一人大吉" (one person is auspicious) for the character "君" (ruler), adding a stroke above the character "忠" (loyalty) for the character "臣" (subject), and so on, which is also possible. However, regardless of when it started, it already existed before the Song dynasty, so Rongzhai's "Sui Bi" has this statement.</p>
<p>The origin of the character 柒 (seven) is discussed in "De Shu Lou Za Chao" with considerable meaning, saying:</p>
<p>"桼 (qi) is the ancient character for seven. The 'Tai Xuan Jing Xuan Tan' says, 'Operate the seven policies (運諸桼政).' The 'Fang Yan' says, 'Wu has the Terrace of Qi E (吳有桼娥之臺).' Wang Mang's 'Hou Zheng Ming' says, 'Weighs fifty seven catties (重五十桼斤).' In Tang dynasty inscriptions, the character seven is also written as 漆 (qi, lacquer). Later generations simplified the stroke as 柒 (qi), and 柒 is the cursive script of 漆. Now it is written as 柒, which is another simplification of 柒."</p>
<p>I believe that 柒 being the cursive script of 漆 is quite credible. Looking at the following three characters, one is the regular script of 漆, one is the cursive script, and one is the character 柒, there are traces of brushstroke changes to be found.</p>
<h3>柒</h3>
<p>As for twenty written as 廿, thirty as 卅, and forty as 卌, they have been around for a long time and are all seen in the "Shuo Wen Jie Zi". Its explanation says:</p>
<p>廿 (nian, tone entering), twenty combined.</p>
<p>卅 (sa, tone suddenly), thirty, now written as 卅, ten combined, also written as 卉, directly as the character for thirty.</p>
<p>卌 (xie, tone first standing cut), directly as the character for forty.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the writing of 廿, 卅, and 卌 is a natural structure when writing numerals. Ancient China used counting rods, so the combined numerals were generally formed by combining horizontal strokes and vertical lines. This shows its remnants.</p>
<p>When the abacus began, I said in an article on counting rods and counters that I did not know its origin. Friends often ask about this, and I have asked myself, but I have not dared to speculate because I have not read enough books. Some say that it already existed in the Northern Qi dynasty, as seen in a book on arithmetic, but I still have doubts about the arithmetic book itself. However, what I can currently cite is that the abacus calculation must have undergone a reform in the Song dynasty, because no historical book has listed more books on calendrical calculation than the "Song Shi" (History of Song). For example, the equalizing balance (commonly known as the steelyard) also began in the early Song dynasty. When I have time, I will collect some fragments and discuss them with readers. I know that there are many omissions in the making of this anthology, but they are all jotted down casually to pass the time. All I do is record the beginnings of things and seek traces of evolution based on what I have heard and seen, as a resource for improvement, and to pave a path for those who organize national heritage in the future! As for details, we must wait for specialized books to be published.</p>

<h3>Japan's Moderate Rhetoric Has Not Changed the Stance of Britain and the United States Continue to Intensify Defenses to Prepare for Any Eventuality Empty Talk Is No Substitute for Demonstrating Facts</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily" commented that Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe declared yesterday that the Japanese government was not pessimistic about the future diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States. After Konoe's statement, the tension in the Pacific eased slightly. The key to peace or war in the Pacific is entirely in Japan's hands, which is known to all. Britain is currently engaged in a life-or-death struggle in Europe and is therefore unwilling to make unwise challenges in the Far East. The United States, while focusing all its efforts on assisting countries resisting aggression, is also unwilling to go to war with Japan and make Hitler happy. Therefore, Konoe's statement can indeed make the people of the Far East breathe a little easier. At the same time, Nomura in Washington must also be much happier.</p>
<p>The Far East Crisis Has Not Disappeared</p>
<p>However, it would be a mistake to assume that the Pacific crisis has already passed. Konoe believes that "if the path taken by the Japanese government is not wrong, there is no need to have any doubts, so we are determined to make Britain and the United States understand Japan's true intentions." The difficulty in the future lies here. Britain and the United States have already understood Japan's "true intentions" thoroughly. If you want them to understand further, it is an impossible task. Therefore, Konoe's statement cannot change the original intention of Britain and the United States to "see the cards". Britain and the United States will continue to intensify their defenses in the Pacific to be able to achieve victory.</p>
<p>Actions Speak Louder Than Words</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" commented on Konoe's remarks the day before, saying, "We are slightly puzzled by what Konoe said, 'Japan is trying to make Britain and the United States understand Japan's true intentions,' but we are satisfied with what he said, the Japanese government is not pessimistic about the future diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States." Britain and the United States have already understood what Japan's "true intentions" are. Britain and the United States' understanding of Japan does not come from the Japanese people's moderate rhetoric, but from what the representatives of Japan abroad do. The power that Konoe and others' pleasant words have on Britain and the United States is far less than the Japanese soldiers in China tearing down a foreign flag, breaking into foreign people's homes, plundering foreign people's property, obstructing foreign trade, and injuring foreign nationals. Unless these soldiers are brought to justice and such incidents are eradicated, foreigners will recognize this kind of behavior as representing Japan's behavior, that is, representing Japan's "true intentions". All moderate rhetoric is ineffective.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Landmine Explosions at Qingyang Port on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Train Was Interrupted for One Hour, with Many Japanese Soldiers and Passengers Killed and Wounded</p>
<p>According to transportation sources, yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, a landmine buried by Chinese forces in the Qingyang Port area of Kunshan on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway suddenly exploded. The sound was deafening and shocking. The Shanghai-Nanjing train was interrupted for about two hours, with many Japanese soldiers and passengers killed and wounded. The landmine was likely pre-buried by Chinese forces.</p>
<h3>Lin Xionji Escorted to Nagasaki</h3>
<p>Departs Shanghai Today on the Asama Maru</p>
<p>Lin Xionji, chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, opposed the 41% tax increase at the foreign taxpayers' special meeting on January 23, shooting and injuring Ke Zijiewei, the director-general of the Public Concession, and Okamoto, the Japanese director. Lin was then investigated by the police station of the Japanese Consulate General. Lin was released by the Japanese side in mid-February and allowed to live at home on Disui Road, and he will be escorted back to Nagasaki for questioning. It is now known that Lin will be allowed to leave Shanghai for Japan on today's Asama Maru of the Dalian Shipping Company. The Asama Maru started from Manila and Hong Kong at 1:30 PM yesterday and returned to Shanghai. The ship berthed at the Huishan Pier and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 5:30 AM today.</p>
<h3>All Bridges Over Suzhou Creek Temporarily Closed</h3>
<p>Honda Arrives in Shanghai and Is Scheduled to Go to Nanjing Today</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Japanese "Ambassador" to Nanjing, Honda Yutaro, returned to Shanghai from Japan today. For protection, the Japanese side temporarily closed all bridges over Suzhou Creek leading to Hongkou from this afternoon. During Honda's stay in Shanghai, the bridges will continue to be closed for short periods. It is reported that Honda is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Nanjing tomorrow (the 28th) afternoon.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Discussing the Evacuation of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>After arriving in Hong Kong by plane from Chongqing on the 26th, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr plans to stay in Hong Kong for a short period. He will then take a ship to Shanghai in about three days. In addition to the Ambassador's wife, his private secretary, McQuin, will accompany him to Shanghai to handle official business and discuss the evacuation of British citizens who have no important reasons to stay in the occupied areas. It is found that Ambassador Clark Kerr was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai before Christmas last year, but due to heavy embassy affairs, he postponed his trip and summoned his wife to Chongqing. Now that he has found time, he is scheduled to accompany his wife to Shanghai by sea on March 2. After completing his official duties, he still intends to return to Chongqing via Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Three Million Yuan Worth of Copper Ingots Were Submitted to the Japanese Side Yesterday, and Maosheng Has Sent a Letter Requesting the Cancellation of the Whittle Case, but the Arrest Warrant Can Only Be Retrieved After Appearing in Court</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the local American firm Maosheng Yanghang previously accused the Swiss national Whittle of stealing three million yuan worth of copper ingots stored in the warehouse of the American shipping company Ruifeng Transport Company. They also accused Ruifeng Company of negligence in safekeeping, and the case was postponed. It was scheduled to be heard this morning (the 27th). It is now heard that it has been postponed for the fourth time to March 11. About ten days ago, through Whittle's efforts, Maosheng Yanghang agreed with the Japanese authorities to sell the twelve million yuan worth of copper ingots (including the previous three million yuan) stored in various warehouses in this city to the Japanese authorities. It is reported that the copper ingots are currently being transported out of the warehouses and handed over to the Japanese side. An employee of Maosheng Yanghang admitted this morning that the copper ingots had been handed over, but said that he could not make a definite statement regarding the handover. The employee made no comment on whether Maosheng Yanghang's New York headquarters would call to approve the sale. It was also heard this morning that Maosheng Yanghang has sent a letter to the Public Concession Police Department and the Swiss Consul General to Shanghai, Fantanal, requesting the withdrawal of all accusations against Whittle for stealing copper ingots. Fang confirmed this morning that he had received the letter, but said that according to Swiss law, the previous arrest warrant for Whittle could only be withdrawn after Whittle appeared in court.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Coal Shortage Threatens Power Supply; Municipal Power Company Faces Similar Difficulties; Ships Requisitioned, No Coal to Transport to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Faris, Vice President of the Shanghai Power Company, told reporters on the 26th that unless coal continues to arrive in Shanghai on schedule in the near future, the Public Concession may have to reduce its power supply within one or two months. The company currently has enough coal in stock for three months. If no coal is shipped soon, the company will not be able to continue supplying all the power needed for long.</p>
<p>"Before the reduction in industrial activity in the Concession, monthly coal consumption was 55,000 tons."</p>
<p>Same Impact on Gas Supply</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, secretary of the British Gas Company, stated that although the company has not yet encountered difficulties, securing coal is indeed a problem. Since the outbreak of the "July 7th" Sino-Japanese War, transportation has become increasingly difficult. Purchasing coal from India is not a problem, but the problem lies in the difficulty of obtaining ships to transport coal to Shanghai. More and more British ships are being converted for wartime use, and the difficulties for both the Shanghai Power Company and the Gas Company are increasing daily.</p>
<p>Difficult to Meet Overall Demand</p>
<p>During the last World War, the cost of coal in Shanghai rose from the usual twenty or thirty shillings per ton to 1,400 shillings. The current situation is not yet so severe, but the shortage of ships has become a problem. Currently, residents of the Concession have a great demand for gas, especially since factories have difficulty obtaining coal, leading them to switch to gas. However, the Gas Company has already used its reserve oil-fired plants, but these can only supplement the main plant's insufficient supply and cannot meet the overall demand for gas from all parties.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Selling Off Hoarded Rice Has Arrived; Secret Investigation of Grain Reserves</h3>
<p>It is learned that the Bean, Rice, and Grain Trade Association will carry out its previous agreement and has already appointed personnel to secretly investigate the true names of rice merchants and customers, as well as the quantities of rice and grain traded in the market before the 24th, for transactions that have not yet been settled. Once the investigation is completed, the Association will report to the authorities of the two Concessions so that they can be dealt with according to the law, to warn others, stabilize the market, and ensure participation in public warehouses and charitable rice shops. It is hoped that those who lack enthusiasm will understand the importance of the overall situation and that industry leaders will promote this promptly.</p>
<p>Rice Grab</p>
<p>Yesterday, at around 7:50 AM, a shop assistant from Jin Sheng Chang Rice Shop at 247 Rue Cardinal Fesch was delivering rice to the Gui family at 3 Lane. While passing by the same road west of Avenue Haig, suddenly sixty or seventy people resembling refugees, carrying bags and other containers, rushed forward and grabbed the rice. The shop assistant was outnumbered and helpless. Two bags of loose rice were snatched. After the police arrived, they managed to capture one old woman on the spot and took her back to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Outstanding Achievements of the New Puyu Hall Inspire Social Sympathy; Mr. Lü Guicong Raises More Than 10,000 Yuan on Behalf of the Hall; Readers of This Newspaper Provide Unanimous Assistance</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper launched the fundraising campaign for the New Puyu Hall, it has received sympathetic support from people in the community, and the amount raised has been considerable. Yesterday, we received a letter from reader Mr. Lü Guicong, describing his visit to the New Puyu Hall in Nanshi and the impressions he gained, which were sincere, passionate, and lively on paper. Mr. Lü said, "I have already donated more than 12,000 yuan on their behalf," and will continue to work hard to raise funds for them. He himself has also committed to a permanent monthly donation of 50 yuan. What a moving and great deed! In addition, a young ethnic Chinese boy sent a letter of praise to the nuns of the New Puyu Hall, willing to donate 200 yuan from his savings, and wrote: "Among those children in the future (referring to the orphans), there must be a hero discovered." Although this is a child's pure blessing, no one can deny this, because every infant born has the potential to become a great person one day, and success or failure depends entirely on education. Now, the hundreds of orphans at the New Puyu Hall are facing starvation. Can we stand by and watch without helping? We hope that the readers of this newspaper will respond unanimously!</p>
<p>Great Sympathizers</p>
<p>To the Editor of the Shen Bao: Recently, I have often read articles in your newspaper introducing the New Puyu Hall, which has attracted the attention of all sectors of society, and people have been donating money one after another. I also have general sympathy for the Hall, and I would like to share some facts through your newspaper. My friend Mr. Deng Zhonghe of Anle Factory invited me to visit the New Puyu Hall in Nanshi after seeing your newspaper's advocacy of this campaign. I was confused at the time and simply went with him. I didn't know that the place was so large, reportedly covering more than 100 acres. Many buildings were built within the walls, and the trees and air were no less than a park. The architecture of the buildings, although not luxurious, was not below the average level, and the cleanliness and order were equal to a good school. The people in charge are a dozen or so nuns who are often seen on the street wearing white hats. It is said that they are "sisters," dedicated to serving the church, without families. In other words, their spirit is poured into the hearts of the poor and needy, without any selfishness. At the time, I felt that if this was true, it was truly admirable. After visiting the classrooms, dormitories, hospitals, wards, and so on, it was indeed true, not only satisfying but also very moving. They sheltered about eight or nine hundred people, ranging from the elderly in their eighties and nineties to infants only a few days old. Except for the old, the disabled, and children under four or five years old who could not work, everyone else, big or small, male or female, had work to do, had considerable spirit, and had considerable discipline. In particular, the little angels around ten years old were lively and adorable. I think that these people, on the surface, are homeless and uneducated, belonging to the category of beggars, but in reality, they are blessed. No matter how old or young they are, even if they have food to eat at home, they definitely do not have such a good environment. I also think that the friends who live in small rooms in Shanghai, not to mention those who live in temporary shelters, even myself, who live in a new-style house with two floors, the environment is far inferior. For example, my son is loved and educated in my home, which is considered above the average level in Shanghai society, but he is far behind the little angels in the New Puyu Hall. Because parents love their children, there are always many inexplicable biases, either being too strict or too doting. In addition, the servants and relatives in the family add to the problems. However, the little angels in the New Puyu Hall are completely different. They have no distinction between near and far, no difference between relatives and strangers. They live the same, eat the same, are taught the same, and play the same. They have the same routines every day. First of all, they have discipline in their lives. What they hear and see is either reading or working. I dare to guarantee that these little angels have no impression of any bad habits from the outside world. They have been nurtured in such a good environment and with good discipline since they were young. In the future, when they enter society, they will not do bad things at the very least, and who knows, they may even create some great figures. As for the nuns, not only are they selfless, bearing responsibilities, and handling work in an orderly manner, but they also have a special virtue, which is "kindness and friendliness," without any temper. I have personally seen that the little angels treat them like mothers, and the old men and women also love them like family members. I also dare to guarantee that there is absolutely no such affectionate spirit in ordinary people's families. There are many charitable organizations in society now, but because I don't have time to visit them, I don't know what they are like, so I dare not say anything good or bad. The situation of this New Puyu Hall is what I have personally seen, so I dare to boldly introduce them.</p>
<p>How was their funding before? But now they have no funds. Since my visit, I invited a few friends for a second inspection the day before yesterday, so I really want to do my part for them. In addition to my own commitment to a permanent monthly donation of 50 yuan, I have already donated more than 12,000 yuan on their behalf. I will continue to work hard to raise funds for them, as much as I can, to seek peace of mind. However, my own strength is limited, and I know very few friends. I am afraid that a drop in the bucket will not help. Therefore, I am writing this special letter to ask your newspaper to appeal on their behalf, and I hope that you will often publish news of this kind so that it can attract the attention of the majority of people in society. I also hope that someone will go to visit and announce the impressions they have gained at any time so that the cause of the New Puyu Hall will not be interrupted halfway, and the old and young compatriots will be educated. This is a truly meaningful charity that is incomparable. In the midst of my busy schedule, I have written this in a rambling manner, and I still feel that I have not expressed myself fully. Please accept my greetings. Lü Guicong. 30th year of the Republic, 2nd month, 25th day.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm of a Little Friend</p>
<p>Dear Sisters of the New Puyu Hall: My Heavenly Mother brought me here to visit you. I saw many old men and women and many young children who have lost their parents. Although their lives are simple, they also have their joys. Their discipline is very good. The discipline in our school is not as good as theirs. I was very moved after seeing it and felt that it was all the result of your good management. I will give you the 200 yuan that I got from my father for writing. I will send this money to the Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank on Sanma Road to be forwarded to you. Please go and collect it. Right now, I have a problem and the doctor told me to rest, so I said I won't write anymore. When my illness is better, I will find a way to raise some money for you. Please work harder with the children. I wish you all the best. February 23rd.</p>

<h3>Teachers and Staff Ordered to Evacuate; American School Prepares to Close; Student Dormitories to Close Today</h3>
<p>According to the English-language 大美晚報, the American School in Shanghai's teachers and staff remaining in Shanghai, in light of the consulate's second announcement regarding the evacuation of Shanghai's foreign residents, have already made preparations to return home. The school's board of directors also announced that, while they will do their best to maintain school classes, which are scheduled to end on April 17th as usual, this cannot be completely guaranteed.</p>
<p>May Close at Any Time</p>
<p>School officials continued that the school may have to announce a complete closure before the end of the semester, either with or without prior notice. The school's dormitories are scheduled to close today. The notice issued to the parents of American School students is as follows: "February 22, 1941. The Board of Directors held a special meeting and decided to inform the parents of students of the school's current situation as follows: The United States Consul General in Shanghai has again announced that American women, children, and non-essential men should evacuate from here as soon as possible. The Board of Directors of this school believes that, under these circumstances, all American residents should comply with this advice.</p>
<p>Ordered to Evacuate</p>
<p>Therefore, the teachers and staff of this school who remain in Shanghai will have no choice but to comply with the evacuation order. However, the teachers and staff who remain in Shanghai will continue to teach in order to complete the academic year (scheduled to end on April 17th), benefiting non-American students and American students who have not yet evacuated. However, the school cannot guarantee that it will continue to hold classes until April 17th, as the school may have to close early. Some directors even believe that the school should be completely closed immediately. The school's boarding house is scheduled to close on the 18th, and boarding students will be directly managed by their parents or by those in Shanghai designated as responsible guardians by their parents as soon as possible. The Board of Directors of this school hopes that you will take these measures into consideration. French Consul General in China, Mr. Magre, in order to promote fire prevention equipment in the French Concession, specifically scheduled a fire brigade review at 9:15 AM on the first day of next month in the French Park. At that time, the fire brigade personnel will also demonstrate various skills.</p>
<h3>At the Border Between Zhabei Chinese Area and Concession, Entry and Exit Are Inspected</h3>
<p>Recently, at various openings at the border between the Zhabei Chinese area and the Concession, such as the Xinzha Bridge, Wuzhen Road Bridge, Mianbaoshan Road, North Henan Road, and Jielukou, the inspection of pedestrians entering and exiting has become more stringent. In addition to female police officers stationed at both the Xinzha and Wuzhen Road bridges, who individually inspect all pedestrians regardless of gender, and require all packages and other items to be opened and inspected, there are no female police officers at the Baoshan Road opening. Therefore, women with suspicious appearances or carrying packages are directly inspected by Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Labor Draft Spreads to Zhabei</h3>
<p>Since rumors of labor drafts spread in the Hongkou area, young men and strong laborers along Broadway Road and Yangshupu Road in that area have been living in seclusion. Even shopkeepers are mostly elderly, weak, or women. Unexpectedly, labor drafts have also been reported in Zhabei recently. According to reports, starting from the night before last, every night between midnight and 3:00 AM, mixed groups dressed in miscellaneous Chinese and Western uniforms have been seen drafting laborers in sections of Zhajiang Road and Qiujiang Bridge facing west, passing the railway entrance of Beisichuan Road in front of Yipin Lane, and Baoshan Road, Gongxing Road, Dingyuan Lane facing west, Huiwen Road, Minde Road, and Song Park Road. On the nights of the day before yesterday and yesterday, sixty or seventy young men and strong laborers were drafted and transported eastward in military trucks. It is also reported that hundreds of people drafted in Hongkou have already been sent to Wusong.</p>
<h3>The "Kestin" Vessel Regains Freedom; Reloads Passengers and Cargo, Sails to Fujian</h3>
<p>The British merchant vessel "Kestin Marler" set sail from Shanghai to Fujian for a trial voyage on the 24th of this month. While loading cargo at the Bund pier, the Japanese authorities detained the cargo and prevented its export because they had not been notified in advance. After negotiations between the shipowner and the Japanese authorities, the vessel has been restored to freedom and reloaded passengers and cargo on the evening of the 25th, setting sail for Fujian. The destination is Dongshi in Fujian, which is not under blockade, so it is expected that the trial voyage will be successful. Once the vessel arrives there, various companies will dispatch vessels separately to facilitate transportation. As for the cargo previously detained from the vessel, the person in charge of the company said that there are no longer any problems.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fog at Sea; Navigation on the Huangpu River Halted Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Due to the recent bad weather and frequent heavy fog at sea, navigation has been considerably hampered, and all ships have been delayed. Especially yesterday morning, the fog at sea was even heavier, and the Huangpu River was also shrouded in dense fog. Therefore, no ocean-going vessels entered the port yesterday morning. It was not until 10:20 AM that the "Haikang" entered the port, followed by smaller vessels navigating the Yangtze River. Export ships were completely suspended for ocean voyages, while those sailing along the Yangtze River ports exported one after another at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Ocean-going vessels were delayed in arriving in Shanghai. The Taikoo "Suiyang," which was scheduled to depart for Singapore and Luzon yesterday afternoon, has been rescheduled to set sail this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Owner of the Yifeng Silk Shop Lends Car to Friend Who Is Kidnapped; Incident Occurs in Front of the Yangtze Hotel; Friend of Cao Shaochen Is Mistakenly Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Cao Shaochen, owner of Yifeng Silk Shop at 226 Shandong Road, is from Nanxun and resides at No. 8, Lane 1576, Xinzha Road. He is wealthy and owns a black-plated car, license number 5179. At 7:30 PM last night, after Cao had dinner at home, his friend Zhou Ziwen (from Wuxi) took the car to the Yangtze Hotel on Hankou Road. When driving along Hankou Road and Yunnan Road, four kidnappers suddenly appeared, all carrying pistols. Recognizing the No. 5179 car as belonging to Cao, they rushed forward, drove the driver Xie Kaiwen out of the car, and kidnapped Zhou along with the car, with one of the kidnappers acting as the driver. Zhou was actually mistakenly kidnapped. At around 10:00 PM, the car was found on Qingdao Road. Driver Xie Kaiwen later reported the kidnapping to the police station. The police are currently investigating.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Investigator Commits Robbery on Public Bus</h3>
<p>Jiang Wenqing from Changzhou, a gambling den investigator, along with two accomplices, boarded a public bus at the junction of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road at around 4:00 PM yesterday. They reached into the pocket of a Western businessman, Wang Ruoxian, falsely claiming they had a weapon, and robbed him of 100 yuan in cash before attempting to flee. They were apprehended by Indian policemen. This morning, they were brought before the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. After questioning, they were ordered to be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Murder Case at the Carlton Apartments; Perpetrators All Japanese; Police Have Notified the Japanese Consulate for Investigation; The Actual Motive of the Murder Has Not Yet Been Determined</h3>
<p>According to the English-language 大美晚報, before 7:00 AM yesterday morning (the 26th), three people suddenly broke into the residence of Indian businessman Gatulia on the second floor of the Carlton Apartments on Baker Road and killed his servant, Wang Jinwan, on the spot. Mr. Gatulia jumped out of the window and fell onto the sidewalk next to the road, injuring both legs. He was sent to the hospital for treatment. His injuries are reportedly not serious. According to Mr. Gatulia's statement to the police, "The three perpetrators who broke into his residence were all Japanese, and he was familiar with two of them." Mr. Gatulia then provided detailed descriptions of the appearance of the two men. The police have notified the police station of the Japanese Consulate in the city and requested that they investigate the whereabouts of the three perpetrators, hoping to arrest them as soon as possible. Various rumors are circulating regarding the motive for this murder, but the official reason for the murder has not been revealed.</p>
<h3>Gang Arrested Inside the Zhongzheng Hotel</h3>
<p>Detectives Yan Kuang, etc., of the General Patrol House received a tip last night that a large number of thieves were hiding in Room 22 of the Zhongzheng Hotel at No. 604, Fuzhou Road. The detectives immediately went to the hotel and apprehended five thieves: Wang Pei from Wuxi, Tan Yin'gen from Suzhou, Chen Baolin from Shanghai, Chen Dongfa from Ningbo, and Wang Changgeng. They seized a woman's overcoat and brought it back to the police station. After investigation, it was learned that the owner of the overcoat was Chen Yunshang, a female guide from the Taishan Tourist Agency, who had been lured away by bandits and robbed of it yesterday in Room 426 of the Dahua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. This morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that because the suspects had committed numerous crimes and there was insufficient time to investigate, he requested permission to detain them pending further investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng, the suspects were ordered to be detained for further questioning in a week.</p>
<h3>Tinsmith Boss Blackmailed for 20,000 Yuan; Case to Be Heard Next Week</h3>
<p>Xu Fuyin from Ningbo, a tinsmith boss at the Public Bus Company residing at 217 Changping Road, is in modest circumstances and was targeted by bandits. On the morning of the 15th of this month, he received a threatening letter by mail, signed by a certain gang, demanding 20,000 yuan as a "birthday gift," otherwise his life would be at risk. On the morning of the 20th, a representative was to be sent with a Great Britain brand cigarette case with a specific mark to contact them at the Jun'an Lane on Jessfield Road in the West District. After receiving the letter, Xu was extremely frightened and unable to eat or sleep. He had to secretly report to the Gordon Road police station in charge of the area. On that day, Chief Detective Wang Cheng and Detective Gao Huixian disguised themselves as Xu's representatives according to the letter and waited near Jun'an Lane. After a while, a man named Hu Kou'er (30 years old) from Jiangbei arrived and was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. This morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that the main culprits, Luo Ming and others, who were on the run, could not be apprehended and requested a trial. Questioned about the defendant's confession, he stated that they had discussed the matter at Luo Ming's house on Xingjiapo Road beforehand. The letter was written by his friend Lao Si because he knew that the victim, Xu Fuyin, was timid and afraid of trouble and they were trying to get lucky. At that time, those guys told me to go and make contact. In a moment of confusion, I ask for leniency. Judge Dong then sentenced Hu Kou'er to eight months in prison, and the threatening letter was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Highway Robbers Everywhere</h3>
<p>Thieves Yang Genkou, etc. from Jiangbei robbed pedestrians of their property with fake guns on the afternoon of the 19th of this month on the corner of Xinzha Road and Park Road. After being arrested and interrogated, they were sentenced yesterday morning by Judge Chuan. Yang Genkou was sentenced to six years in prison, Zhang Jinsheng to three years in prison, and Tang Yuzuo to two years and six months in prison. The fake guns were confiscated.</p>
<p>According to the 大陆报, on the night of Tuesday this week at 11:00 PM, a certain person was robbed by two thieves in Lane 596, Beijing Road. All his clothes were stripped off, and even his glasses were taken away, leaving him completely naked and shivering with cold. He ran to a nearby Chinese policeman to borrow a piece of clothing to ward off the cold and reported the incident to the police station. However, he was so panicked at the time that he could not distinguish the accents of the two thieves. Thief Gu Zhaoxiang from Jiangbei was found carrying two pistols and five bullets near Rubenson Road and Xiaoshadu Road on the morning of the 19th of this month. He was arrested by the Chinese and Western police officers of the Putuo Road police station's reserve team and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. It was learned that he and several others who were on the run had robbed pedestrians Wang Jinhai on Seymour Road and Wang Bingshu on Hart Road of overcoats and cash totaling 182 yuan between the 9th and 13th of this month. This morning, Judge Huang interrogated him and sentenced Gu to five years and six months in prison to deter others. The guns and bullets were confiscated.</p>
<h3>In the Case of the Assassination of Wu Qilun, the Perpetrators Appeal and Retract Their Confessions; The Perpetrators Were Also Involved in More Than Ten Robbery Cases</h3>
<p>Lawyer Wu Qilun was assassinated in his residence on Tongfu Road last spring. After the case occurred, the Public Concession police arrested the perpetrators Xia Guifu, Wang Xingfang, Shang Jindai, and thieves Wei Shulin, Guo Guimao, Xia Shoufeng, Li Gongcai, Zhang Fucai, Wu Wensheng, Wu Wenxiang, Wang A'er, Song Wenmin, Sun Changfa, Liu Jichang, Ding Shaokun, etc., and implicated Gu Zhuxuan, owner of the Tianchan Wutai, and others. The case was repeatedly investigated by Judge Feng of the First Special District Court.</p>
<p>Verdict Announced</p>
<p>Guifu was sentenced to death, Wang and Fang and Shang Jindai were sentenced to life imprisonment, and Gu Zhuxuan was found not guilty. Regarding the robbery part, Guo Guimao was sentenced to ten years in prison, Xia Shoufeng to seven years in prison, Li Gongcai to seven years and six months in prison, Zhang Fucai and Wu Wensheng were each sentenced to five years and ten months in prison, Wu Wenxiang to five years and four months in prison, Wang A'er to five years in prison, Song Wenmin to three years in prison, Sun Changfa and Liu Jichang were each sentenced to two years and six months in prison, and Ding Shaokun was exempt from prosecution because he had already been convicted and sentenced in another case. The perpetrators Xia Guifu, Wang Xingfang, Shang Jindai, etc., and the thieves Wu Wenxiang, Wu Wensheng, Guo Guimao, Li Gongcai, Zhang Fucai, etc., refused to accept the verdict and separately engaged lawyers Wang Jishi and Chen Wenzhu to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court.</p>
<p>Filed an Appeal</p>
<p>Because the case was complex, involving not only the assassination of Wu Qilun but also more than ten robbery cases, the Second Branch of the High Court accepted the appeal. Yesterday, it opened an investigative hearing and ordered the perpetrators to be brought to court. The perpetrators of the assassination of Wu Qilun unanimously retracted their confessions in the original trial and denied committing murder. As for the thieves Guo Guimao, Xia Shoufeng, and Li Gongcai, who averaged more than ten cases, only admitted to one or two, with the aim of seeking a reduced sentence. Because further evidence was still needed and there were too many appellants, the court ordered that a special hearing be held again at a later date.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Plans to Formulate Teaching Guidelines; Education Funding Increased by More Than One Million Yuan This Year</h3>

He specially went to the Department of Education to review the work achievements of the 29th year and study the teaching guidelines for this year. As a result, he took (1) expanding national education, (2) improving secondary education, (3) developing social education, (4) implementing wartime education, and (5) promoting county education administration as the most urgent tasks, and specially instructed Director Huang to implement them earnestly.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department Releases Education Report; Subsidy Fees for Chinese Private Schools Totaling 315,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department released its annual report for the previous year, stating that the Council approved the Economic Committee's recommendation to establish a special education committee. Its tasks are (1) to study the organization of the Council's Education Department and the current status of Council-run schools, to research whether expenses can be reduced or efficiency can be improved, and to review the subsidy methods, to prepare a report for review and approval; (2) to study whether the current education policies can be changed, and to refer to the suggestions made by the special education committee in April 1937, but not be limited by them. According to the above suggestions, they relate to the expansion of subsidy methods, the increase in the number of schools, and the restrictions on education funding allocated from municipal revenue. As of the end of the previous year, the committee's work had not yet been completed.</p>
<p>Last year, a total of 161 Chinese private schools applied for subsidies. Of these, 144 were approved, with subsidies totaling 315,000 yuan, of which 20,000 yuan was proposed to be used to set up a children's sports ground and a children's library. Sixteen schools have had their subsidies suspended one after another for various reasons. As for foreign schools, subsidies totaling 310,000 yuan were allocated, of which 250,000 yuan was distributed to nine Japanese schools.</p>
<p>Of the original school buildings of the Council-run schools, the Yucai Public School and the Xinzha Road Primary School have been restored for use. More than ten schools are still attending classes in temporary school buildings. The new buildings include the following two: (1) A temporary school building for the Singapore Road Chinese Children's Primary School is located at No. 29 Singapore Road; (2) A reading room was added to the North District Primary School, dedicated for the use of students from subsidized Chinese private schools.</p>
<p>Last year, the prices of various commodities soared, leading to a sharp increase in school expenses. Therefore, the Council discussed the issue of increasing tuition fees in June. As a result, it was decided to moderately increase tuition fees in all schools starting in September to supplement funds. Subsequently, prices continued to rise, so the issue of tuition fees was raised for discussion again in December. As a result, it was resolved to increase them again starting in February of this year.</p>
<p>Ten outstanding former students of the Council-run Chinese Children's Public Schools have received scholarships, and fifteen new students have received scholarships for their excellent performance in the entrance examination. In addition, some students in the Western Children's Public School have received stipends, either in the form of a full refund of tuition fees or a partial refund of tuition fees.</p>
<p>Last year, the number of students registered in the Council-run Chinese Children's Public Schools totaled 2,675, in the Chinese Children's Primary Schools, 4,343, in the night schools, 1,461, and in the Western Children's Schools, 1,287, for a total of 9,766 students.

<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Awkward</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>To want to go, then go; to want to stop, then stop; to want to do, then do; to want to quit, then quit—this cannot be called awkward.</p>
<p>What is called awkward is wanting to advance but not being able to, and not advancing not being an option; wanting to do but not being able to, and not doing not being an option—*this* is what is called awkward.</p>
<p>Putting on a long gown is awkward—unable to carry a load on your shoulders, unable to lift anything with your hands; awkward. The rise and fall of the market is unpredictable; awkward. Going long is not an option, going short is not an option; awkward. Having no money is awkward, having money is also awkward. Having no money means not being able to fill your belly; having money means running the risk of being targeted by robbers; awkward.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid being awkward, there are ways: Whether in conduct or in managing your own life, you must first make up your mind and establish a foothold. If it can be done, then do it; if it cannot be done, then don't do it. How to deal with failure, how to deal with success—with these calculations made, boldly proceed and you will not find yourself in an awkward position. If the signs are bad, then don't proceed—you will not be in an awkward position either.</p>
<p>The most awkward thing is speculation and opportunistic behavior, being concerned about both gain and loss, what is called "being afraid of losing face while suffering from consumption." Speculating means fearing failure; taking chances means being found out—this is truly somewhat awkward.</p>
<h3>Mr. "Whatever"</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>According to Mr. "Whatever" himself, he is an "utterly" devoted practitioner of the philosophy of "non-action and yet nothing is left undone," a true "philosopher." Moreover, he is an unparalleled "recluse" in these chaotic times, not seeking "empty fame" but only "purity"!</p>
<p>Such being the case, a gentleman chooses his dwelling place, and our Mr. "Whatever" naturally settled down in the "pure and happy land" of Shanghai, where to "live" naturally contains the implication of "living in seclusion."</p>
<p>For three years, the gentleman's "Dao" has deepened considerably. He not only believes himself to have grasped the subtle essence of Daoism, but also to be able to promote and disseminate it to "modernize" it. What does "modernize" mean? The gentleman rolled up his sleeves, lifted his fat and heavy double chin, and smiled slightly:</p>
<p>"Wonderful! Am I the only one who can grasp the subtlety of this Dao!"</p>
<p>Thereupon, the gentleman's fat body suddenly "floated."</p>
<p>Although the "uniquely blessed" Mr. "Whatever" refuses to reveal the "heavenly secrets" to proclaim the method of attaining the Dao to the masses, you can, after all, comprehend a thing or two if you carefully observe his daily words and deeds. For example, if you ask him:</p>
<p>"Sir, what do you feel about the ×× incident?"</p>
<p>"Haha... me? I don't care about anything..."</p>
<p>"Sir, there has been a problem with the ×× Relief Society. What do you think should be done to mediate?"</p>
<p>"Haha... me? I don't care about anything..."</p>
<p>"Sir, on the day of the opening of the ×× massage parlor, they want to invite you to unveil the plaque. Will you go?"</p>
<p>"Haha... me? I don't care about anything..."</p>
<p>Hearing his voice is like seeing the man. Mr. "Whatever" is called Mr. "Whatever," of course, because he "doesn't care about anything" in all matters. However, don't be fooled by him. If you only know one thing and not the other and rashly try to learn his "whatever" philosophy, then I can tell you, you are sure to become a good-for-nothing poor man!</p>
<p>Because although he tells people that he himself "doesn't care about anything" in all matters, there are, in fact, exceptions (why are there exceptions? I say this is where his old Daoist learning is "profound," making it unfathomable). For example, when he sees the price of rice soaring, he will jump up from the opium den in triumph, grabbing the third concubine's arm with one hand and excitedly pretending to be calm:</p>
<p>"Haha... eight hundred dan of goods in the warehouse! Eight hundred dan! The day before yesterday it was... today it has risen to..." Although he can't calculate his "earnings" for the moment, in short, it has increased a lot. As for the numerical issues, in any case, there is a son who just graduated from the university's economics department to take care of it; he can "not care about anything."</p>
<p>But the worst thing is that I heard that someone wants to expose his hoarding in public, so he was so angry that he trembled and ran around to the west to get things straightened out. As a result, the situation did indeed ease up a bit, but after all, there were still people who dared to scold him in private. So the gentleman then took out his "amulet" and said faintly:</p>
<p>"Let them go, let them go, scold or don't scold, I don't care about anything."</p>
<h3>Bayonet</h3>
<p>— Zhi Hai</p>
<p>There is no other way to deal with the world, only the word "sincerity."</p>
<p>Speak in a regular manner, do things with feet on the ground.</p>
<p>Do not take partial knowledge for complete learning.</p>
<p>You can deceive yourself temporarily, but you cannot deceive yourself forever.</p>
<p>"Humility" is the best asset.</p>
<p>Develop the habit of "doing today's work today."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(4) Unexpected Encounter</p>
<p>Although Zhao Si was the oldest and could be considered an old hand, he was momentarily frightened and flustered. Standing at the escalator entrance, he simply stared blankly at the two fellow apprentices whose faces had also turned gray, not knowing how to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>"I'll take responsibility for what I did! If he really dies, I'll pay with my life!" Zhao Yukun's face suddenly turned red, and the courage he had had before was instantly restored by half. Without greeting anyone else, he rushed downstairs in a hurry.</p>
<p>"Lao... Er..." Qiu Haitang wanted to call him back, but somehow, his throat was hoarse and he couldn't shout. Zhao Si knew his temperament and that he couldn't deal with this kind of thing at all, so he did his best to persuade him back to the room first, promising to take Rong Kui downstairs immediately to say a few words on Zhao Yukun's behalf, and then come back to report.</p>
<p>Ma Jinshou and several other supporting actors also heard the noise and crowded into Qiu Haitang's room to inquire. Some volunteered to go downstairs with Zhao Si to make arrangements, while others stayed in Qiu Haitang's room, everyone discussing at once.</p>
<p>He didn't know how long he waited before Zhao Si and six or seven other people hurriedly returned to report that Shen Mazi had not died, but was seriously injured and had been sent to the hospital. Zhao Yukun had confessed to quarreling and fighting with him in the police station, and had unintentionally knocked him down the stairs, causing this disaster. He was currently being held at the station and would not be able to leave until Shen Mazi recovered from his injuries at the earliest.</p>
<p>When everyone heard the news, they inevitably discussed it again for a while, and didn't disperse until dawn. Qiu Haitang simply sat on the edge of the bed with his head hanging down, unable to say a word.</p>
<p>"Lao Er has really caused a big disaster this time!" Zhao Si forced himself to cheer up after everyone in the room had dispersed. He moved his fat body to a chair close to Qiu Haitang, and said in a low voice, "Shen Mazi's disciples and family members don't seem to be good people! Just now, in front of us, they have been saying that they will hold you alone responsible for all the losses this time. Needless to say, our costumes will be kept by them. And until Shen Mazi's injury is healed, let alone Zhao Yukun being able to escape, even you may not be able to leave!" (42)</p>
<h3>The "Myth" of Ice Skating</h3>
<p>— Zhong Zimang</p>
<p>The weather is cold and gloomy, just right for ice skating.</p>
<p>However, in the few remaining ice skating rinks, the crowds are sparse, with only a few tickets sold, while the dance halls next door are bustling with activity.</p>
<p>This makes me think of a year or two ago—</p>
<p>At that time, ladies in Shanghai were mad about ice skating, and countless opportunistic bosses converted dance halls into skating rinks, adorning them with beautiful lights and setting up "coffee corners," just like dance halls. There were even "ice girls" appearing as "skating partners."</p>
<p>Some stores were clearing out their stock of ice skates while ordering new ones from abroad, but still couldn't keep up with demand.</p>
<p>For "modern" ladies, carrying a pair of ice skates was more fashionable than carrying a purse.</p>
<p>At that time, there were also skating competitions, and some "skating stars" even emerged—their photos were on the covers of magazines, making movie stars envious. Yes, there were special ice skating issues and small newspapers.</p>
<p>It was really strange; summer was not the season for ice skating, but swimming pools were deserted while everyone crowded into skating rinks for fun. There was no shortage of sweat, but luckily, some skating rinks had air conditioning and electric fans. The ladies skated diligently, sometimes gasping, "Boy, bring me a glass of iced bridge juice..."</p>
<p>Sipping through straws, but the feet with iron attachments were heavy.</p>
<p>Beside the skating rink railings, some ladies were learning to skate with such diligence that their georgette cheongsams were soaked with sweat. Sometimes they would suddenly fall forward or backward in a big tumble, but they still skated happily...</p>
<p>The skating rinks also held races, dances, and costume games...</p>
<p>Sonja Henie became an idol worshipped by modern ladies. I remember reading an interview with an "Oriental Sonja Henie."</p>
<p>"Modern" ladies, regardless of the weather, skated, twirled, and rolled on the smooth floors...</p>
<p>But what about now?</p>
<p>The decorations around the skating rinks are also very perfunctory, as if they are managed by another group of people. The "modern" ladies are no longer seen—yet this is the season for ice skating.</p>
<p>Thinking of the past ice skating craze, it feels like reading a "myth" or something.</p>
<p>But at the same time, I discovered the epidemic of trends in this city.</p>
<p>Apprentices' Expectations by Xiang Er</p>
<p>Anyone who has read the article "Living Off Apprentices" in this publication on the 14th of this month will think of the suffering of apprentices being exploited. Not only do they receive no salary, but they are also subjected to beatings and scoldings, and even the duration of their apprenticeship is extended—these are all "ways for masters to make money." However, all apprentices endure all this inner sorrow, waiting and hoping for that one hope—the end of their apprenticeship—to become a shop assistant.</p>
<p>Becoming a shop assistant is a success for apprentices. Not only do they receive a small salary, but the boss—the former master—treats them much more politely. However, from apprentice to shop assistant, one gets older, responsibilities increase, and needs and desires also increase. How can one support parents and start a small family with just this small salary?</p>
<p>However, some clever bosses are particularly willing to help at this time. If you don't have enough this year, they will lend you next year's salary; if you don't have enough this month, they will lend you next month's salary. In this way, year after year, the shop assistant's experience in business can develop in a truly amazing way. However, the salary still cannot be increased. If you were to switch to another shop in the same trade at this time, you could indeed get a substantial reward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, shop assistants today have lost their freedom, and changing masters at will is even more impossible because their debts increase as dramatically as their body, experience, and talent year after year.</p>
<p>At this time, the shop assistant—the apprentice turned shop assistant—remains as he was. He can probably understand the former master's politeness and help. Isn't this just another "way to make money"?</p>

<h3>Ten Outstanding Comedians of Peking Opera</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Since Liu Gansan, De Zijie, Huang Sanxiong, Luo Baisui, and others have passed away one after another, mediocrities such as Wang Changlin, Guo Chunshan, Ci Ruiquan, and Xiao Changhua have become dominant in the comedic roles. The lack of talent is evident. In the last thirty years, there have been no successors. Therefore, I have selected ten of today's comedic performers to form this "Ten Outstanding Comedians of Peking Opera."</p>
<p>(1) Guo Chunshan: Guo Chunshan's comedic performance style is a package deal from the north, proficient in both Kunqu and other operas. He is also quite old. He has seen Liu Gansan and Huang Sanxiong, and has partnered with Qian Jinfu in singing "Drunkenly Beating the Mountain Gate." In large northern performances, he is often invited to sing "Returning to Camp" and "Taking a Carriage." His qualifications are no less than the late Wang Changlin, Cao Ergeng, Sun Shengwu, and others, all of whom are his disciples. Last year, he came south with Ma Lianliang (specifically to take care of Ma's new theater) and gave a lecture on the Kunqu operas "Returning to Camp" and "Taking a Carriage" at the Shanghai Opera School. In general, his art is inferior to Zhou Wudi from the south.</p>
<p>(2) Ci Ruiquan: He was a comedic performer who stood alongside Wang Changlin in the early Republic of China. Because Wang helped Yang Xiaolou and Yu Shuyan, his position surpassed Ruiquan's. Changlin was skilled in martial arts but clumsy in robe and belt plays; Ruiquan was not skilled in martial arts but also capable of dialect plays. Therefore, in large performances at the time, Changlin would always be paired with "Little Shepherd Boy," "Green Screen Mountain," and "Linked Rings"; Ruiquan often sang "Liansheng Inn" and "Heroes' Meeting." In fact, Ci's robe and belt plays were also not his strength; his Sai Xishi in "Nengren Temple" was highly acclaimed among insiders.</p>
<p>(3) Xiao Changhua: In the early Republic of China, his position was originally inferior to Wang's and Ci's. Since joining Mei Lanfang's troupe, he has gradually gained attention. His robe plays are more commendable than his short garment plays. His voice is brighter and crisper than Guo's and Ci's. His Jiang Ziyi in "Heroes' Meeting," Tang Qin in "Examining the Head and Stabbing Tang," the innkeeper in "Liansheng Inn," Jia Gui in "Famen Temple," and Zhu Cang in "Beating the Nephew at the Grave" are all Xiao's masterpieces. Changhua is a major teacher at the Fu Liancheng Opera School, so the younger generation of disciples who came from the Fu School all treat him as a master. His son, whose stage name is Shengxuan, is also a disciple of the Fu School, specializing in comedic roles, and his art is based on his father's style.</p>
<p>(4) Ma Fulu: He once studied under Changlin and later also studied under Fu Xiaoshan. He is skilled in both civil and military roles. In the last ten years, seeing that martial comedy is not valued by insiders, he has specialized in civil comedy; however, he is clumsy in square scarf plays. Therefore, whenever he performs Zhang Biegou in "The Injustice Done to Dou E," De Lu in "Imperial Stele Pavilion," and Jia Gui in "Famen Temple," the performances are full of brilliance, unmatched by recent performers. Occasionally, when he plays Tang Qin in "Examining the Head and Stabbing Tang," Yan Pu in "Beating Yan Song," Jin Song in "Golden Jade Slave," and Old Man Pan in "Green Screen Mountain," it feels like nothing about him is suitable. Fulu's voice is extremely loud, and he can also perform the roles of old women in "Beauty Trap" and "Yanmen Pass," and painted faces in "Weishui River" and "Famen Temple."</p>
<p>(5) Jia Duocai: He is also an old performer among recent actors. This person is better at comedic old woman roles, and his art is based on Chi Zijun, his grandfather. His imitation of Chi is better than that of Chi's disciple Xiao Shoushan. His Sai Xishi in "Nengren Temple" is no less than Ci Ruiquan's.</p>
<p>(6) Ru Fuwei: Fuwei's art, in terms of square scarf plays, diligently studies Xiao Ershun (Changhua), and in terms of short garment plays, his physical expression is better than Ma Fulu's. His voice is also not weak. Following the rules and regulations is his strength. Because he does not like to cater to vulgar tastes, many laymen and theatergoers prefer Fulu and abandon Fuwei. This is why Ru's fame is not as great as Ma's.</p>
<p>(7) Cao Ergeng: Cao is a disciple of Guo. He is better at short garment plays. He is suitable for playing naive and simple characters. His voice and expression are all commendable. He has been with Cheng Yanqiu for a long time. His Zhang Lver in "The Golden Lock Record" and the yamen runner in "The Vermilion Mark Record" are all masterpieces.</p>
<p>(8) Wang Fushan: Fushan is Changlin's son. His art is mediocre, but he adheres to the rules. He once drifted to Zhangjiakou. Yang Xiaolou and Yu Shuyan, out of their old friendship with Changlin, summoned him to be a supporting actor. His art is similar to his father's, unskilled in both civil and military roles, but his voice is not as good as Changlin's. The woodcutter in "Asking the Woodcutter," the family servant in "Stealing the Imperial Scroll," Zhu Guangzu in "Stealing the Hook," and Hu Cheer in "Stealing the Halberd" all have some of Changlin's style. In recent years, his artistic skills seem to be inferior to before, and his martial skills have deteriorated even more.</p>
<p>(9) Luo Wenkui: Wenkui is a descendant of Luo Fushan. His art is very ordinary. Except for not being skilled in martial arts, his civil plays seem to be better than Wang Changlin's. He has been a supporting actor for Mei Lanfang, Yu Shuyan, and Xi Yunfu. In recent years, his voice has deteriorated, and he does not often perform in troupes. Last year, through the introduction of Li Hongchun, he came to Shanghai to teach at the Opera School, teaching comedic and old woman roles.</p>
<p>(10) Sun Shengwu: Shengwu is from Suzhou. His grandfather lived in Beijing. He has an elder brother named Shengwen, who is a professional actor singing painted faces. Both of them attended the Fu Liancheng Opera School. Shengwen is now a teacher at the school. Shengwu's art, Kunqu opera, was learned from Guo Chunshan, and his square scarf plays were taught by Xiao Changhua. His expression, physical movements, and steps are all very good. His comedic old woman roles are especially good. It is a pity that this child's voice is rough and his stature is short. Otherwise, he would be a complete talent in civil comedy.</p>

<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>"Mandarin Duck Tribulation"</h3>
<p>— Cheng Bingnu</p>
<p>"Mandarin Duck Tribulation" is a famous work by the British literary giant John Galsworthy, originally titled The First and The Last. Now, it has been brought to the screen and turned into 21 Days Together, which is also quite moving. The film stars Vivien Leigh from "Gone with the Wind" and Laurence Olivier, the male lead from "Rebecca," so its quality is guaranteed to be excellent.</p>
<p>Although this film does not break away from the typical Hollywood love drama, its theme is not simply "love above all else." Galsworthy advocated for humanity, and he vehemently criticized a gentleman who intended to frame others (in the film, he is Laurence's brother). He wrote the protagonist, Laurence, as someone unwilling to betray his conscience for love. Therefore, when he learns that the innocent, frustrated pastor who was arrested has been legally found guilty, he becomes worried and restless all day long, disregarding his brother's advice and his brother's future. He decides to confess because he, not the pastor, strangled his lover Vivien Leigh's ex-husband.</p>
<p>The story develops very powerfully, starting from when Laurence accompanies Vivien Leigh home, passing through the strangling, escape, court hearing, and until the pastor is sentenced to death after twenty-one days. It is truly like peeling a banana, one step after another. Then, Laurence decides to revel with Vivien Leigh as much as possible within these short twenty-one days, preparing to confess before the pastor is executed. The plot here seems to take another turn. The screen shows quick sketches of the two reveling, like "a bomb lurking, waiting to explode when the fuse burns to the end."</p>
<p>The twenty-one days pass in a short moment. Laurence thinks of the poor pastor and decides to confess. On the screen, we see Laurence striding towards the court, Vivien Leigh following closely behind him. They pass through crowded streets, pushing through the bustling pedestrians. Laurence walks faster and faster. Vivien Leigh sees that she cannot keep up. At this moment, someone on the street shouts about a newspaper report, saying that the pastor has died of illness in prison. Vivien Leigh, after reading the newspaper, is even more panicked, fearing that Laurence has already reached the court. Therefore, she chases after him tightly, finally catching up to him at the last moment, at the entrance of the court, and telling him that the pastor has died and that confessing is unnecessary. The plot, like a stampede of ten thousand horses, is only pulled back here, and the audience, after being anxious and nervous, can finally breathe a sigh of relief. The director's handling of this climax can be described as extremely energetic and surging, tightly controlling the emotions of every audience member.</p>
<p>Vivien Leigh's acting is consistently delicate and moving, forming its own style compared to "Gone with the Wind." Laurence is calm and decisive, fitting the identity of the character in the play, making it a fine piece of work.</p>

<h3>Li Amao's Health Mailbox</h3>
<p>(General answer to Xu Zonghua, Huang Keming, and Wang Deping, who suffer from bad breath) Bad breath comes from indigestion. On one hand, you should control your diet, and on the other hand, you should facilitate bowel movements. After each meal, you should also brush your teeth diligently.</p>
<p>(General answer to three people regarding the foreskin) (Mr. Deng Shihua) It is probably caused by an overly long foreskin that easily accumulates dirt. It is best to consult a doctor for examination. If it is too long, removing it will eliminate this phenomenon. (Mr. Liu Wenjun) It is best to remove the foreskin, one to avoid the accumulation of dirt inside the phimosis, two to avoid hindering fertility, and three to avoid sexually transmitted diseases. (Mr. Jin Wenjie) This is dirt accumulated inside the foreskin, not a disease.</p>
<p>(Mr. Xu Yongcheng) I am unmarried, and I have no evil thoughts during the day while working, nor do I get close to women, but after falling asleep, I often wake up with an erection. Why is this?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is a physiological phenomenon, not a pathological phenomenon. Please do not worry.</p>
<p>(Mr. Wang Taisheng) My friend is twenty years old and got into a fight with a neighbor, resulting in a lot of his hair being pulled out by the other party. It has been over a month now, and it has not grown back. I wonder if it will grow back?</p>
<p>(Answer) It will grow back soon. Observe the grass in the courtyard in summer. If you pull it out, it will definitely grow back.</p>
