<h3 id="c3">巴爾幹那你看勢的展望 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>上週巴爾幹半島發生一個重大變化，德軍兵不血刃而佔領了保加利亞全境，從此地圖上又少了一個獨立國家，希特勒所控制的領域却隨着擴展了十萬三千五百餘方公里。就事論事，不能不承認他的手腕爽辣，計算周密；今世學步德國的其他侵略者，眞是望塵莫及。不過，在當前的一刹那間，他雖然在物質上得了些便宜，但若以整個損益賬而論，他至少在精神上却喪失了蘇聯的支援，激起了土耳其的敵意，今後更有隨時在東南歐洲遭遇大戰的可能。</p>
<p>假定說希特勒早已準備在巴爾幹方面，大幹一下，決定於囊括保加利亞乃至南斯拉夫之後，進攻希臘，從而掠取近東油田和蘇彝士運河，那麼土耳其即使參戰，在他正是求仁得仁，原可絲毫不必有所顧慮；今後祇等南斯拉夫屈服，便可指揮大軍，長驅南下，直撲薩洛尼加，更不必派遣專使，賚送密函，以互不侵犯的保證，希冀土國的「善意中立；」事實上安加拉當局也決不致愚蠢到這步田地，連行將燒及自身的火燄都認識不淸，而甘願步波蘭羅馬尼亞乃至保加利亞的後塵。蓋未來的局勢，異常明顯：德國如果攻希，其目的決不止於援我，至低限度亦是希望染指近東；但是德國不取近東則已，苟取近東，必然又以保障和平防止　禍一類符籙，要求土國許其「假道」或使用根據地，這是今世侵略者所慣用的不二法門，他們祇要在「目標國一的邊境一帶，屯集重兵，然後再開口一勒索」，不怕意志不堅或實力不充的國家，不低頭就縛。但無論就民族的氣質論，備戰的實况論，乃至外交的環境論，似乎都沒有理由相信新興的土耳其會得自暴自棄一至於此；又况同盟的英國正在一旁鼓氣，而素來關切的莫斯科政府又剛剛藉保國人盟的機會，發出了詞止義嚴的譴責文告，暗示蘇聯對於納粹勢力的伸人巴爾幹，已到了容忍的一極度」。在這種情形之下，而謂土耳其政府行將坐視希特勒蠶食巴爾幹，而把對英對希所早應實踐的盟的義務，再度「延擱一下去；雖說或是神通廣大的希特勒在外交方面竟然另有妙用，但究竟是不可想像的事。</p>
<p>據各方消息，德軍開入保境者，己不下五十萬人，保京及全國各中心區之交通，已在德軍完全控制之下，盛傳德車攻希，已迫在眉睫；但同時七耳其政府在希臘邊境及保國邊境所集中的部隊，據說已不下一百萬名，並有大批軍艦集中韃靼尼爾海峽；美國合衆社甚至傳出英國準備自埃及亞歷山大港抽調一部份艦隊駛入黑海，蘇聯且已默許的消息；這些傳聞雖需要予以極大的保留，但證明東南歐洲的局勢確已到了一觸即發的境地；有人說希特勒所採用的是聲東擊西的戰略，他打算分散英國的注意力，然後再以猝不及防的閃電戰術，猛撲英倫三島；又有人說他用的仍是虛聲恫嚇的策略，目的祗想在加緊控制保加利亞之後，進一步脅迫南斯拉夫入彀，而在東南歐洲一隅暫時還不擬有所作爲；這兩種有法，雖都不無可能，但在身處火坑邊沿的土耳其，對於未來的演變，却不能不作最惡劣的打算，她必須立即和英希兩國講求聯防的具體措置，同時更須自蘇聯取得充分的支持；相信最近英土兩國的軍事談話，以及英國外相艾登在巴爾幹方面所主持的外交活動，對於今後的局勢，必能發揮極大的作用，而英蘇兩國利害的接近，更將在土耳其居間斡旋之下，踏進具體的階段，這在全世界民治陣綫的心目中，無論如何，倒是一種彌可珍貴的新收穫。</p>
<h3 id="c4">孤立派遭空前失敗　全美趨向眞正團結　租借法即可獲得參議院通過　修正案十二件經辯論後否決 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>華盛頓　參院昨晚首次對租借案舉行夜間會議、因政府方面已對企圖阻止美國陸軍參加外國戰爭之修改案加以擊敗也、整日爭辯之結果、全部勝利屬諸　斯福總統、政府方面反對限制案、以為此種限制將使羅斯福總統對外交政策大感束手，而令日本得以放胆南進、不必恐慮美國之干涉、投票結果政府取得大多數之擁護、而予最後通過時、戰敗修改之企圖、修改之原文、規定租偕法案並未授權總統遣派美國軍隊至海外作戰、除非　獲國會之允許、（八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　在租借法案之論戰中、政府昨日獲得兩　利、一爲　議院否決一附加案、規定如美國以軍力護送物品航運往歐時、須得國會之通過　爲加省參議員的翰生之附加案、嚴格禁止應用美國軍隊往西半球以外之土地或屬地、此案亦遭吾決、前者投票表決時爲六十三票對　十八票，後者爲五十六票對三十五票、此次投蔡極足表示租借案最後投票表決之趨勢、（八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　參院昨吾決援英案之修正文一起、該修止文機禁止美國軍艦護送由西半球運出之軍用品、此項護航修正文、旣被打銷、參議員瓊遜乃另提一修正文、主張今後經費不得用以維持西牛球外或總統所定交戰區內之軍隊、但參院旋以五六蔡對三五票打銷之、上述兩修正文之遭吾狀、使此案之通過、愈近一步、於是政府黨領袖巴克萊乃預料、參院可於星期六夜通過此案、渠吿新聞記者、渠將設法使參院於星期五·六兩夜開會、俾通過此案惟反對黨領袖聶氏則謂、下星期以前、未能舉行最後投票、（八日路透社電）</p>

<p>紐約　紐約　報對於孤立派所提租借案之修正、昨在參院遭空　失敗、大爲稱　、謂可表示美國之趨向眞正全國團結、（八日路透社電）</p>

<p>更看國米漲風昨亦愈轟愈烈、大有直上靑雲之勢、在多方競購之下、益感不敷分配、居奇作俏、更覺混沌、喊聲一躍恒有數元作客亦都祗求得貨、不論價格之品貴、所以結果無論厚薄兩粳、價繼續飛騰四元之巨、計開崑山斛見白粳一百念四元、次至一百念一元、原包一百念七元半、次至一百念六元、靑角薄稻斛見一百念一元半、次至一百十九元半、原包一百念五六元、糯米去路雖無他貨之盛、但以市貨亦稀、形勢並見帶緊，開香港自兀九十九元、次至九十日元半、</p>

<p>麵紛　昨日漲風續熾，因受米市嚴重刺激、本客囤戶、頗爲活躍、雖洋粉定貨及香港轉口貨源源運到、而人心但以今後問題爲虞、不計大衆生活與全市安全、且華廠平賣粉，以新到洋麥尙待晒理、恐下週初未能恢復供應、故本容實銷與囤戶相繼購買、開盤即升四五角、計開鐘樓花鳥牌澳粉二十九元七角至五角、美麗牌二十九元九角、金龍牌坎粉二十八元九角、黃牛牌二十八元三角半至四角半、午後漲至二十八元七角、惟中途稱有獲利多頭出籠、故市面允居動盪中、</p>
<p>洋粉　連續進口、迭誌本報、茲悉日怡和洋行富　輪到埠、除由港裝來洋米外、另有麵粉二千一百九十八包、業已起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况沉寂如常，新到洋麥、因有潮濕尙在晒理、華廠進胃、暫不貪取、日廠方面、雖有納胃、而國麥存到兩枯、欲購無貨、在米粉漲風之下、貨主居奇不出、故市面日趨沉靜云、</p>

<p>蔣委員長本月五日在招待金政員宴會席上、發表演說、表示對軍事·外交·財政等問題甚為樂觀、深信中國必能單獨獲取最後勝利、自此項演說披露後、本埠中外各報、均先後著文評論、一致認為蔣委員長所表示者、絕非誇大之辭、</p>
<p>感謝友邦　實際援助</p>
<p>英文大美晚報昨社論云、蔣委員長在國民參政會議中之對抗建最後勝利有把握的演詞、極足使一輩信念不堅者、從此堅定其意志、同時法除一部分中國人之過分樂觀、委員長詞中、特別側重中國能以自力作戰取得勝利之能力、無須完全仰賴蘇美英之助力、惟同時指出此途徑並非康莊平坦、必須經過無量艱苦、蔣氏感謝友邦之友誼及助力、惟並不希望彼等捲入戰爭、中國所要求者、僅友誼上之援助而已、</p>
<p>團結一致　努力對外</p>
<p>中國有許多人士、常感覺美日戰爭、爲不可避免、一旦此事發生、不免便　內之團結减弱、另一部分人士、則相信英美終必加入已歷四年之中國作戰、彼時中國將得一機會以淸理其內政、此兩說之謬點、今均爲蔣委員長之演詞所闢除、當此作戰勝利已屆接近之際、一有躊躇或罷手之想、實爲自趨失敗之必然途徑、萬一內部發生紛亂、不但不足以招致外援、即已有之外援、亦將斷絕、故中國此際、自應　續一致對外、爲民主國在亞洲區域效一臂之勞也、</p>
<p>蔣氏言論　絕不誇大</p>
<p>大陸報評論云、蔣委員長五日在重慶所發表之演說、頗具自信、我人聆悉其偉論後、自信之心、亦不禁油然而生、以蔣委員長自成爲中國民族領袖後、從未發誇大言論、作巧辯矯飾之詞、其一言一語、皆經審愼考慮、列舉事實、樸實無華、民衆之所以對其欽仰與信賴、其故即在此、且蔣委員長亦從未使中國民衆有所失望、因之、當五日演說時稱、中國賴其本身力量、即足以獲致最後勝利、故決無人深信此係誇大之辭、或言不由衷、</p>
<p>勝利信念　皆表同情</p>
<p>中國作戰之初、即不希望倚頓外力、蔣委員長固已迭次予以闡明、今中國目下已將日本吸引至其預期境地、其希望美國或蘇聯參戰之心理、當更淡薄無疑、中國所要求者、　爲美·蘇·英·三國能繼續在物質上對中國有所援助、以蔣委員長深信各友邦決不對日妥協、當可嚴守中立、決不致陷中國於不利、多數觀察家對於蔣氏之自信、皆表同感、日本旣不能於三年內擊敗中國、則敢言三十年內、亦必不能擊敗中國、中國之民族主義、傳統上即其有不可破壞性、蔣委員長固深知此點、恐日本不久、亦將發覺此點矣、</p>

<p>美籍經濟專定分析日本經濟窘態</p>
<p>日本南進之聲浪、因德國在巴爾幹外交之勝利、日益增高，近來日本已在泰國集中大量軍火、包括坦克車·重機關槍·飛機配備·及炸彈等、以爲策馱南進之軍事準備、雖聲　洵　、似有一舉而下新加坡·緬甸·及荷印諸地之雄心、但事實上此種軍事準備、設無經濟力量以爲奧援、反易形成騎虎難下之苦、如日本在經濟上事前無充分準備、則在南洋軍事之冒險、適足招致國內經濟之加速崩潰而已、本埠某美經濟學家昨根據此項原則、分析目前日本經濟上之困難情形如次、</p>
<p>對華作戰　瀕於破產</p>
<p>日本最近在國內實行所謂「新體制」、以統制思想、統制民衆運動、統制經濟、允以統制經濟一項、最爲日本戰時需耍、但推行以來、破綻百出、蓋日本原爲先天不足、資源貧乏之國家、四年來用於對華戰事者、達一百七十萬萬日元、一九三七年蘆溝橋事變發生後、即向美國購買大量工業原料軍火及軍需原料、結果日本黃金、大量流入美國、一九三七年日本黃金流入美國者、爲美金三萬五千萬元、一九三八年爲一萬七千萬元、一九三九年爲一萬六千九百萬元、一九四〇年爲一萬萬元、總計四年來日本流人美國之黃金、的七萬萬八千萬美元之鉅、因此今日日本內部經濟枯竭、對外貿易信用、極難維持、如不亟謀補救、則經濟破產、勢所難免、</p>
<p>本年預算　格外龐大</p>
<p>但實際上此種危、機、無法挽回、即以日本一九四一至一九四二年之預算而論、其中特別戰事預算爲五十八萬萬元、普通預算爲六十八萬六千三　百萬日元、共計爲一百二十餘萬萬日元、以後恐還有追加預算之必要、此種特別戰事預算、根本解決之法、實爲結束在華軍事活動、但目前中日戰爭、因中國之優勢持久、不能結束、故祇有增發公債與增加稅捐、以補不足、因此本年度之租稅額、當增至三十六萬萬九千萬日元、較去年度增加五萬萬元以上、國民牛活痛苦、負担日益加重、怨聲載道、無可奈何、</p>
<p>濫發公債　消化呆滯</p>
<p>公債方面發行額、四年來已　日金二百四十八萬萬元、去年發行額爲六十六萬六千五百萬日元、其中由民間消化者、僅四十八萬三千八百萬日元、當發行額百分之七十二、共分兩期銷售、上期由一月至六月、發行額爲二十七萬六千五百萬日元、其中銷售民間者、爲二十六萬三千六百萬日元、佔百分之九十五、下期由七月至十二月、總額爲三十九萬萬日元、民間消化者、僅佔百分之五十六、即以上下兩期之實銷額相對比、下期亦低於上期百分之二十、可見日本公債消化力之萎縮狀態、及經濟力量消退之一般、此實由於歐戰之影響、蓋自歐戰擴大後、日本歐菲貿易大减、益以美國禁運及人民自動排斥日本生絲等物、國內生產遂陷疲滯、國民收入、因之减退、生活費用、反因物價上昇而增高、公債消化、亦遂呆滯、</p>
<p>通貨膨脹　物價飛騰</p>
<p>因日本公債濫發、爲强化民間應募能力、於是惡性通貨膨脹、自然形成、一九三七年六月底、日本銀行發行額爲十六萬四千萬元、同年年底、增至二十三寓零五百萬元、一九三八年底紙幣增發額爲二十七萬五千四百萬元、一九三九年底爲三十六萬七千九百萬元、去年十月底、增至二十七萬萬餘元、超出限額十萬萬元以上、據觀察家估計、至今年年底、日本銀行發行額將達四十萬萬元、雖日本當局一再擴張保證準備限度、以免顯示通貨之惡性膨賬、而其結果、予惡性膨脹一層理由而已、由於此種情形、幣値大跌、物價飛漲、人民水深火熱、敢怒而不敢言、竭澤而漁、財政金融之崩潰、旦夕間事耳、</p>
<p>所謂南進　意存恫嚇</p>
<p>况果日本不顧一切、悍然南進、則英美兩國必聯合實施經濟封鎖、斷絕日本與第三國之商業關係、則日本海外之市塲與原料之供給、將全部斷絕、後患實不堪設想、因爲內在經濟實力之空虛、日本統治階級、幷非不知南進之困難、但所以佈置南進之姿態者、實因欲恐嚇英美、誘致兩國放棄在南洋之利益、則日本一舉兩得、一則可獲取荷印一帶雙富之　源，解決國內原料恐慌、二則得包圍中國、斷絕中國海外之接濟、摧毀中國之抵抗力、而結束持久將四年之戰爭、故南進實爲日本之外交攻勢、</p>
<p>一切計劃　均遭擊破</p>
<p>但此種顯已受阻、英美之日趨合作、與中國之反攻軍事準備、使日本感受極大之苦悶、恐嚇不能奏效、戰爭力不從心、雖猶企望德意在歐洲擊敗英美、而得在遠東坐享英美之權益、然軸心之勝利、渺望無期、日本確已遭遇空前之困難，此種困難、如日本一日不中止在華之軍事冒險及南進措置、即一日不克解決、如中·英·美·三國能乘此良好機會·聯合一致、則侵略者勢將束手待裏也、</p>

<h3 id="c86">說婦女節 <a href="#c86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>小朋友們！昨天「三八」，是國際婦女節；因此，筆者要把這個婦女節的史略，告訴給你們，想來也是你們所樂於知道的吧？</p>
<p>在近代史上，婦女運動的開始，是在一九〇六年，那時歐美各國的婦女們，在倫敦召集過一次國際性的會議，所爭的是婦女參政權及母性保護。接着一九〇七年三月八日，國際婦女又在德國開會，而一九〇九年三月，美國芝加哥的婦女，又來一次大示威，參加的婦女有八萬之衆，在婦女運動史上，造成了雄壯的一頁。</p>
<p>這樣一來，婦女運動的在潮，就很快的澎湃到歐美各國每一角落，而一九三〇年三月，各國婦女在丹麥京城哥平哈根開會時，就提議把三月八日這一天認爲國際婦女節。所以婦女節的正式確定，到如今恰是三十年的歷史。從此以後，各國婦女，到了每年的「三八」，就會舉行盛大的慶祝。</p>
<p>我們要知道重男輕女的惡習，由來已久，不但在中國，在世界各國都是如此。到了二十世紀，婦女們是覺悟了，同樣是人，不應受社會的歧視和各種不平等的待遇，所以開始呐喊，而展開婦女運動的第一頁。各國的婦女，正感覺到同樣的苦痛，祇要有人倡議，就會附和，所以展開之後，就立刻迅速的擴大起來。</p>
<p>爲了長久的被人壓迫，婦女們就不得不自力奮鬥。我們看到各國婦女所提出的口號，如婦女參政權，婦女選舉權，母性保護，保護女工，男女在政治上，經濟上地位平等一類的詞句，大同小異，無非在提高女權，使男女在任何方面，都是平等，打破過往不公允的待遇，那也是應當的。</p>
<p>丟開了西方，再說東方。在東方吧，婦女們正和其他一樣，也比較落後一些。事實上，東方的婦女，所受的壓迫苦痛，比西方為甚。但日本的婦女，直到一九一九年才開始活動，紀念這個光榮的「三八」。而中國的婦女，更遲一步，到一九二二年，武漢，兩廣，上海，平津等地，方由婦女們起來慶祝「三八」。今年的國際女女們的節日，也將在慘淡中過去了吧？</p>
<h3 id="c87">潛艇戰 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>

<p>星期日是阿亮閱報能最從容的一天，因為這天是假期，早上不要急急的到學校裏去，於是便能把報閱得很詳細，不然那有心思去細讀，只得的略的把題目瞟一膘罷了。</p>
<p>在上星期的今天，他看見了一段關於「軸心國揚言將對英發動大規模潛艇戰」消息，便吸引了他的注意力，可是他看完了這段消息後，仍舊不十分明瞭，便要求他爸爸講些關於潛艇的趣聞。</p>
<p>「潘艇戰就是用潛水艇來襲擊他國的兵艦的戰略。這戰略能吾得到成功，完全靠着它秘密的位置，而且潛艇長必須知道他國的兵艦在什麼時候駛過和在那裏隱避？當兵艦保護商船航行時，潛艇也能從事襲擊，那必須偷偷地把潛水艇駛到兵艦和商船的中間，等到駛到適當的位置後，然後慢慢地向水面升起，把潛望鏡露出水面，便由艇長作最後的一番視察，再決定要不要把魚雷放射出去，把兵艦或商船擊毀？當魚雷射出魚雷管口時，潛艇便開到最高速度，一面向水底下潛低，倘然不是這樣，倒很危險，因爲魚雷若貼近潛艇爆炸，於是艇中精密的機械都要被震盪的水浪所激動，以致毀壞，這時艇長更能迅速地把潛艇和兵艦的距離分別出來，如果兵艦接近潛艇，那便立即下令把潛艇停駛，把油放出來，這便可表示那潛艇被兵艦放射出來的　水彈所擊毀而沉沒了，其實是個「烟幕彈」，這一幕騙局是再巧妙也浚有了。其次講到潛艇內的機器，精密得像手表一樣。艇員在潛艇裏隨處都可休息，因爲他們很難得到安適的位置，就是不在工作的艇員，也在睡眠中　磨着，要是遇到什麼意外的事情，就是在睡眠中也要起來受苦，同時一睡眠，空氣可節省一些，因爲在水底下，空氣是再賣貴也沒有了，故每個艇員都抱着「陲眠主義」一個剛離開了床舖，便另有人去遞補，他們和衣　睡，很少脫去了衣服睡眠的。當潛艇升出水面時，他們便睡在甲板上。如果氣候寒冷，更覺痛苦，因爲潛艇中沒有一些空餘地位來安置他們多帶的衣服，所以潛艇要是駛到北方海洋上，往往有凍死的可能。電流在潛艇中可以說和人性命一樣的重要，因爲電流的强弱，能够限制潛艇在水中的速度，潛艇的構造是再精密也沒有了，如有一絲一毫的錯誤便使全艇被毀。故潛艇長必須具有特出的智力和才能，更須有訓練的，才可勝任，因爲全艇艇員的生命都在艇長一人掌握之中。這種人才是不易多得的。」阿亮的爸爸便在這裏打住了他的話匣子。</p>

<p>— 盧燕英</p>
<p>（一）我所最喜愛的康元玩具</p>
<p>我有許多玩具，其中以康元廠出的比較多些；因為康元的出品，種類多，式樣好；所以我常常賣康元玩具。在康元玩具之中，我最愛好的要算是「爬孩」了。</p>
<p>我爲什麽要喜歡「爬孩」呢？我喜歡「爬孩」的第一個原因是爲了「爬孩」會動。我以前也曾喜歡過大大小小的洋囝囝；但是我現在都不大喜歡了；因爲他們都呆得很：不是只會坐，便是只會立，很少會走動的。爬孩却不是如此，他生着一個圓圓的喜笑的臉龐，穿着一件美麗的淸潔的衣服，兩手伏在地上，當他兩脚移動時，手也跟着移動，這比了不會走動的洋囝囝要好得多了。我們的老師曾經告訴我們說：「一個孩子，應該要動，腦要用，耳目要用，手足更要動。」所以會動的「爬孩」是我最喜歡的。</p>
<p>我喜歡「爬孩」的第二個原因，就是因爲「爬孩」不但會動，而且會向前進。我曾經聽得老師說：「小朋友耍會動，但是不可以亂動。」我們求知識，練身體，修養品性，都要求進步，假使我們只是打架，相駡，貪玩，就算是會動，那末就要變成壞孩子了。「爬孩」能够前進，使我得了一個很好的敎訓，因此我最喜愛牠。</p>
<p>我最喜愛「爬孩」的原因，旣是爲了牠會動，而且能够前進，我願意我也學牠一樣的會動，一樣的會前進，如果我將來知識進步，身體康健，那末，我將怎樣的感激「爬孩」！將怎樣的愛護「爬孩」呀！</p>
<p>（二）我希望康元廠再有何種新玩具</p>
<p>康元廠的玩具，出了已有好幾十種了。動物也有，汽車也有，兵器也有，眞造五花八門·可是我希望的一種玩具，他們還沒有。因爲我喜歡的玩具是動的，而且是向前動的。這種玩具像「爬孩」等已有了，可是我還希望能有許許多多東西或是動物，能够一同動，一同向前動的玩具。（不一定要怎樣大，只要多就是了。）</p>
<p>我希望的玩具是這樣的；</p>
<p>如果是步兵，那末就要有好幾十個步兵，人人都拿着槍，機關一動，就能一同放鎗，或一同開步走，或一同體操。如果是兵車，那末就要有好幾十輛兵車，機關一開，就會一同前進。如果是馬，那末就要有好幾十只馬，機關一撥，就會一同向前衝過去。這樣可以使得我們知道：不但一個人要動，要向前的動，而且要許多人一同動，一同向前的動。這不是更有意思了嗎？</p>
<p>而且，我們的國家現在很危險，如果不是全國人民一同起來，恐怕不能够打倒敵人。所以我們的玩具，也應該要能够表示一同動，一同向前動的才好。爲了這個原因，我便希望康元廠以後能够製造這種一同動一同向前動的新玩具來給我們玩。</p>

<p>— 英</p>
<p>鼓手內行叫「打鼓老」，民國以來，票友學操琴者日多，練打鼓的甚少，所以外間對於琴手注意的人很多，鼓手却很少爲人提起，其實鼓是三軍司令，琴實軍中參謀，鼓是指揮琴的，琴手是聽鼓手開出點子來拉曲譜的。</p>
<p>凡是懂些戲的，提起朱家奎，王少卿，徐蘭元，楊寳忠，周長華，穆鐵芬，趙機羹，大概都曉得他們是名琴手；如果把「打鼓老」中杭子和，喬二（玉泉），白德（登雲），程子餘，侯長靑，魏三（益三），何增福，傳少山，鮑桂芳舉出來，我敢說南方內行中知道他們都是打鼓好手的還沒有幾個。其實鮑桂芳是楊小樓的臂膀，小樓沒有他的鼓，在臺上就沒有了勁。侯長淸是尙小雲武戲鼓手，手腕之靈，點子之緊，鮑禿（桂芳）以外要數他了。何增福是梅蘭芳的鼓手，現跟陳少霖。傳少山是幫王少樓。程子餘是尙小雪文戲打鼓。白登雲爲程硯秋多年老打鼓。魏三，喬三，杭子和是北方打鼓老中三傑。王瑤卿門徒大都是用魏三的（章遏雲華慧麟程玉菁等）。喬是王鳳卿王幼卿的打鼓，近年常依馬連良。杭子和曾依余叔岩，所以今之余派老生如孟小冬王少樓陳少霖楊寳森都歡喜用他；甚至坤生徐東明也的他打鼓。這三位名鼓手中，技術以魏三比較稍次。喬三手快眼快，「一捧雪」「九更天」「靑風亭」「四進士」「羣英會」和生旦對嘴戲，都打得非常　溱，火熾。因為腕力靈活，所以開出點子特別俏皮，精神氣魄，不是魏三所能及。杭子和之鼓，是火侯純靑，點子淸，派頭大，凡是余叔岩的拿手戲如「空城計」「定軍山」「戰太平」「打鼓駡曹」「打棍出箱」「洪　洞」「賣馬」「珠簾寨」「狀元譜」「烏盆計」「八大鎚「李陵碑」「捉放曹」，杭子和是打得非常嚴緊，可說世無其匹。所以他在北方，儼然是「打鼓老」中首領了。　上圖爲杭子和近影</p>

<h3 id="c90">「森林恩仇記」 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 莫野</p>
<p>我們記憶得很淸楚，當曹禺的「雷雨」「　出」搬上銀幕後，並未獲得意外的成功，甚至如「雷雨」，在雷影手法的處理下，可能有優越的成就，但是由於導演的對劇本無法深刻理解，遭遇到全盤的失敗。</p>
<p>誰都知道，「原野」在曹禺三部曲中，無論在技巧上，人物性格的刻劃，輿論界一致認爲是技巧最佳的一部，就是曹禺自己也是這麼說的。「森林恩仇記」雖然存在着部份的缺點，但是由於原作的成功，題材的洗煉，主題的正確，在「民間電影」的洪流中，它是値得評介的一部。</p>
<p>無容吾認，導演對全劇的處理，並不能所謂恰到好處。雷影與戲劇，雖有人口口聲聲說它是姊妹藝術，却照樣有着不遠的距離。故，導演對　材的洗煉顯得還不够。所成功的，就是始終在一貫緊張的氣氛下，强調仇虎的性格，反映民衆處於土豪劣紳逼迫下的慘况，在電影攝製的有利條件下，描寫得非常有力。正如後來仇虎在森林中的一塲幻境，羣鬼亂舞，正義之士呻吟於鐵蹄之下，尖刀山，火油鍋，這並不是如「地獄艷遇」之類，幼稚淺顯的奉仕，在觀衆是應該有所驚惕着的。</p>
<p>結束乏力，光明面的反映，似乎還顯不够。</p>
<p>演員中，袁美雲（飾金子）缺少潑刺的風度，她沒有韌的精神表現，甚至定型化。她所給予觀衆的認識，仍是那麽弱不禁風，抑鬱成性的女子。一引的仇虎，較之「穴仁貴與柳迎春」「鄉下大姑娘」中的演技，非特進步，而且對於個性也把握得切當，沒有過火的地方。幾個特寫鏡頭，也表現得非常好。至於在森林中，仇虎情緒的轉變，並不見得過於突兀。王引在全劇中，似乎是最成功的一個。</p>
<p>還有，値得一·提的是王竹友，他在銀幕上一直處於配角的地位，其實他的演技並不弱於那些時下所謂「風流小生」之流。焦大星是一個優柔寡斷的人，他很能適當地表現出來。其他，鏡頭太少，演技無從多所發揮。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Nazi Invasion of Greece Imminent; British Fleet Prepares to Enter Black Sea to Fulfill Alliance Obligations to Turkey; German Army Rapidly Advances Towards Greek Border <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Budapest: Diplomatic circles have received a report from Turkey stating that Britain is preparing to send a portion of its Eastern Mediterranean fleet into the Black Sea. British Foreign Secretary Eden has promised the Turkish government to fulfill this matter, and the Soviet Union has tacitly approved it. Turkish airfields have been prepared to accommodate thirty squadrons of British aircraft. It is reported that the Turkish government insisted that Britain assist Turkey with its fleet and immediately dispatch effective aid during the war as a minimum condition. According to news from Athens, Eden suggested to Greece that if Greek troops needed to withdraw from Albania, Britain would provide a fleet for the Greek troop withdrawal. In recent days, large numbers of Greek troops have gathered in the Aegean Sea region, possibly for this reason. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Southern Slavic Capital: Yesterday, widespread but unconfirmed news circulated here that Germany would attack Greece via Bulgaria today (Saturday). Several factors support this: First, Turkey cannot or does not intend to resist the Axis powers. Second, Greece is determined to fight. Third, Yugoslavia's position has been resolved. The latest news from Bulgaria states that a large German army is rapidly advancing south through Bulgaria, and communication with foreign countries has been almost completely severed. It is reported that the German ambassador to Athens had another lengthy discussion with Greek Prime Minister Koryzis last night. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Basel: According to a Berlin dispatch in the "Basler Nachrichten," German government officials stated, "German troops in Bulgaria must wait some time before taking steps to secure peace in the Balkan Peninsula and launching war against Greece. As for when and where to eliminate Greece, and how to eliminate it, it must be decided by Germany." The dispatch also stated that the German government considers Eden's proposal to Athens extremely dangerous. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia: Military authorities here stated yesterday that according to Greek plans, Greece will soon withdraw from Thrace. It is understood that this plan stipulates that the Greek people retreat to the mountainous defense line west of Thessaloniki. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia: The start date for German military action against Greece is approaching. Observers believe that the calamity of war for the Balkans is imminent. Within the next twelve hours, all of Southeastern Europe may again face widespread destruction. Bulgaria has assembled hundreds of thousands of German troops, and heavy troops are stationed along the Greek and Turkish borders. The battle between Germany and Britain for Europe will be decided by Greece's fate. It is generally agreed that Hitler will not wait for a clear victory. If not, then the various signs in the past forty-eight hours would make Hitler's plans incomprehensible. Experienced politicians believe that since the Soviet Union has not taken any action so far, it will not take any action even if the war breaks out outside its borders. However, most pro-Soviet people in Bulgaria hope that "if war breaks out this time, the Soviet Union will no longer sit idly by." (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia: Diplomatic sources recently stated that Germany, in order to facilitate a Greek-Italian reconciliation, may bomb Thessaloniki, and believe that Greece may only offer "nominal resistance" before being willing to negotiate peace. Military sources recalled that before Germany's heavy bombing of Rotterdam last spring, it had first declared its intention to bomb the city in hopes of softening Dutch resistance. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Turkey Feels Seriously Threatened; Intensifies Preparations for War</p>
<p>Ankara: Turkish political circles believe that Turkey will inevitably become Germany's next target after Greece. Observers believe that Germany has not dared to immediately attack Turkey and seize the Dardanelles Strait because it is concerned about offending the Soviet Union. Therefore, they are paying close attention to news from the Soviet Union. A recent article in "Red Star" (the Soviet military's official newspaper) attacking Bulgaria's alignment with Germany has led observers here to believe that the Soviet Union is gradually distancing itself from Germany. Travelers from Bucharest have said that many German soldiers there openly discuss Germany's next step being to take Turkey and seize the oil fields of Iraq and Mosul. (Editor's Note: This is Britain's lifeline.) (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Ankara: The Turkish Parliament is scheduled to convene on the 10th. The People's Party will hold a closed-door meeting before the parliament convenes. It is reported that Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu will report on Turkish foreign policy to the closed-door meeting. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: All Turkish merchant ships of 250 tons or more will be under the command of the Ministry of Communications from March 21st, whether domestically or overseas. The reason for this is to maximize the use of all ship positions. A maritime transport committee has been established here, with representatives from the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Communications, the General Staff, and the National Chamber of Commerce. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Ankara: The Turkish government yesterday ordered the Ministry of Economy to confiscate all commercially or privately owned coal mines. The government will compensate all mine owners. The purpose of this new measure is to prevent a shortage of coal supply. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Sino-British-American Loan Negotiations Progressing Smoothly in the United States <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>London: It has been learned here that negotiations between China, Britain, and the United States to adjust and utilize the U.S. stabilization loan to China are progressing smoothly. British and Chinese authorities are also holding talks on a British export loan of £5 million to China. The British loan of £5 million has been delayed due to the following two reasons: (1) the desire to link this loan with a tripartite agreement to stabilize foreign exchange; (2) Britain originally stipulated that this loan could only be used by China to purchase goods in the sterling area, but the sterling area is currently unable to easily allocate its war materials to meet China's needs. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>South Korea Has Made a Firm Decision to Defend its Independent Territorial Integrity</p>
<p>Southern National Capital: The South Korean government's statement that it will never forget the nation's highest interests and its independence and integrity has comforted the people of the South Korean capital, which is full of rumors. South Korea is very unwilling to sign the Axis Powers' Pact. However, judging from the situation, South Korea will soon be asked to issue a separate declaration of maintaining friendship with the Axis Powers and the Soviet Union. According to unconfirmed reports, South Korea will be asked to be a peacemaker between Greece and Italy, with conditions including Italy giving up territorial demands and Greece ceding Thessaloniki and Patras to Germany. It is reported that the opposition leader intends to publish an article demanding that the government provide a full explanation of the current situation. South Korea is currently using the spring exchange as a pretext to continue mobilizing reserve soldiers at all levels. Its main force is now stationed in the north, with a mobilization of no more than 500,000 people. According to reliable sources, although German officials went to Zagreb, the results were unsuccessful. This has somewhat reassured people here. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: This morning, Turkish radio broadcast a discussion of the possibility of Yugoslavia joining the Tripartite Pact. We firmly believe that Yugoslavia has made a firm decision to defend its independence and territorial integrity. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: Reuters diplomatic correspondent claims that the Yugoslav government will inform Britain and the Soviet Union of its views on the Balkan situation this weekend. The situation next week may depend on the content of this communication. Yugoslavia, with its important strategic position, is a key player on the Balkan stage. Germany may wait and see how effective its diplomatic pressure on Yugoslavia is before taking any military action. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>London: Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that more startling news may continue to emerge from Yugoslavia. Currently, Germany has released several unreliable and unconfirmed news items from the South Korean capital as part of a psychological war, such as the rumor that Britain has or intends to present Yugoslavia with an ultimatum. The British ambassador to South Korea, Campbell, has not reported his recent diplomatic activities to London. However, according to reliable sources in London, the news of the ultimatum is not to be easily believed. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Budapest: The "Hungarian Newspaper" recently published a dispatch from its Washington correspondent stating that President Roosevelt recently met with the Yugoslav ambassador to the United States and told him that the Axis powers' influence in Europe must be prevented from expanding at all costs. The main purpose of the "Lend-Lease Act" is to achieve this goal. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Budapest: Yugoslavia will issue a declaration of friendship with Germany simultaneously. According to unconfirmed diplomatic reports, South Korean Regent Prince Paul has gone to Hitler's mountain residence in Salzburg to confer with him. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Nazis Tighten Control Over Bulgaria; Sofia Filled with Wartime Atmosphere</p>
<p>Budapest: According to direct news arriving here from Sofia, German troops in Bulgaria, which is under German occupation, strengthened their control last night in preparation for implementing military action in the Balkans. The Bulgarian army has ordered the mobilization of all doctors, nurses, and chemists, stating that they must immediately join the army upon notification. The German military commander has taken control of all train stations and other central areas of Sofia. German troops are assisting police in directing traffic in Sofia. Sofia is filled with a wartime atmosphere. The Hungarian semi-official newspaper "Pesti Lloyd" stated that it has learned that the Greek government "will resolutely reject future German suggestions to mediate the Greek-Italian war." (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia: According to a resolution of the Bulgarian cabinet, all employees of Bulgarian commercial ports and railways have been mobilized and given military ranks in accordance with military law, such as officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>London: According to news from Rome, General List, commander of the German troops in Bulgaria, led a German military delegation to meet with Bulgarian King Boris yesterday. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov, Foreign Minister Popov, and Minister of War Daskalov also met with the German military delegation. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia: Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov, Foreign Minister Popov, and Minister of National Defense Daskalov unanimously stated yesterday that Bulgaria's policy remains unchanged, with national interests as its goal. The Minister of National Defense stated that the Bulgarian army will resist anyone who invades its territory. (Haitong News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Sofia: The Bulgarian government cabinet, including the Prime Minister, attended a supporters' meeting in the Sobranie district last night. Foreign Minister Popov explained the process of Bulgaria joining the Tripartite Pact. General Daskalov, Minister of War, also gave a presentation on the current state of the army, which received unanimous praise. The ministers also expressed confidence in the government's foreign policy and efficiency. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e3">Prospects for the Balkan Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>A major change occurred in the Balkan Peninsula last week: German troops occupied all of Bulgaria without firing a shot. From that point on, there was one less independent country on the map, while the territory controlled by Hitler expanded by more than 103,500 square kilometers. Speaking plainly, it must be acknowledged that his methods are swift and decisive, and his calculations are meticulous. Other aggressors in the world who try to emulate Germany are truly far behind. However, although he has gained some material advantages at the present moment, if the entire profit and loss account is considered, he has at least lost the support of the Soviet Union in spirit, aroused the hostility of Turkey, and may encounter a major war in Southeastern Europe at any time in the future.</p>
<p>Suppose that Hitler has long been prepared to make a big move in the Balkans, deciding to attack Greece after encompassing Bulgaria and even Yugoslavia, thereby seizing the Near East oil fields and the Suez Canal. Then, even if Turkey participates in the war, it would be exactly what he wants, and he would not have to worry about it at all. He only needs to wait for Yugoslavia to surrender before he can command a large army and drive southward directly to Thessaloniki. He would no longer need to send special envoys to deliver secret letters, guaranteeing non-aggression, hoping for Turkey's "benevolent neutrality." In fact, the Ankara authorities would never be so foolish as to not recognize the flames that are about to burn them and willingly follow in the footsteps of Poland, Romania, and even Bulgaria. The future situation is extremely clear: if Germany attacks Greece, its purpose will certainly not be limited to aiding Italy, but at the very least, it hopes to gain access to the Near East. However, if Germany does not take the Near East, it will inevitably use talismans such as guaranteeing peace and preventing disasters to demand that Turkey allow it to "pass through" or use its bases. This is the only method that contemporary aggressors are accustomed to using. They only need to concentrate heavy troops on the border of the target country, and then start extortion, not fearing that countries with weak wills or insufficient strength will not bow down and submit. However, whether judged by the nation's temperament, the reality of its war preparations, or even its diplomatic environment, there seems to be no reason to believe that the newly emerging Turkey would abandon itself to such an extent. Moreover, its ally Britain is encouraging it from the side, and the Moscow government, which has always been concerned, has just issued a strongly worded condemnation after Bulgaria joined the alliance, implying that the Soviet Union has reached the limit of its tolerance for the extension of Nazi power into the Balkans. Under these circumstances, to say that the Turkish government will sit idly by as Hitler nibbles away at the Balkans and once again "postpones" its alliance obligations to Britain and Greece that it should have fulfilled long ago, although it may be that the remarkably resourceful Hitler has some other clever diplomatic tricks, is simply unimaginable.</p>
<p>According to various sources, the number of German troops entering Bulgarian territory is no less than 500,000. Traffic in Sofia and all central areas of the country is completely under the control of the German army. It is widely rumored that the German attack on Greece is imminent. At the same time, it is said that the Turkish government has concentrated no less than one million troops on the Greek and Bulgarian borders, and a large number of warships have been concentrated in the Dardanelles Strait. The United Press has even reported that Britain is preparing to withdraw a portion of its fleet from Alexandria, Egypt, and send it into the Black Sea, and that the Soviet Union has tacitly approved this news. Although these rumors need to be taken with a grain of salt, they prove that the situation in Southeastern Europe has indeed reached a point of imminent danger. Some say that Hitler is using a feint to the east and attack the west strategy, intending to divert Britain's attention, and then use a sudden blitzkrieg to attack the British Isles. Others say that he is still using a strategy of empty threats, aiming only to further coerce Yugoslavia into submission after strengthening his control over Bulgaria, and does not intend to take any action in the corner of Southeastern Europe for the time being. Although both of these methods are not impossible, Turkey, which is on the edge of the fire pit, cannot but make the worst preparations for future developments. It must immediately consult with Britain and Greece on concrete measures for joint defense, and at the same time obtain full support from the Soviet Union. It is believed that the recent military talks between Britain and Turkey, as well as the diplomatic activities led by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the Balkans, will play a significant role in the future situation. The convergence of interests between Britain and the Soviet Union will, under Turkey's mediation, enter a concrete stage. This, in the minds of the democratic front worldwide, is a precious new gain.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Isolationists Suffer Unprecedented Defeat; United States Moves Towards Genuine Unity; Lend-Lease Act to Pass Senate; Twelve Amendments Defeated After Debate <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The Senate held its first night session on the Lend-Lease Act last night because the government had defeated amendments attempting to prevent the U.S. Army from participating in foreign wars. After a day of debate, complete victory belonged to President Roosevelt. The government opposed the restrictions, believing that such restrictions would greatly hamper President Roosevelt's foreign policy and allow Japan to advance south without fear of American intervention. The vote resulted in the government obtaining the support of the majority, and when it was finally passed, the attempt to defeat the amendment failed. The original text of the amendment stipulated that the Lend-Lease Act did not authorize the president to send American troops overseas to fight unless authorized by Congress. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: In the debate on the Lend-Lease Act, the government gained two victories yesterday. One was that the Senate rejected an additional amendment stipulating that if the United States used military force to escort goods to Europe, it must be approved by Congress. The other was that California Senator Johnson's additional amendment strictly prohibited the use of American troops on land or territories outside the Western Hemisphere. This case was also rejected. The former vote was 63 to 18, and the latter was 56 to 35. This vote is extremely sufficient to indicate the trend of the final vote on the Lend-Lease Act. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Senate rejected another amendment to the aid-to-Britain bill yesterday. This amendment prohibited U.S. warships from escorting military supplies shipped from the Western Hemisphere. With this convoy amendment defeated, Senator Johnson proposed another amendment, arguing that no funds should be used to maintain troops outside the Western Hemisphere or in a combat zone designated by the President. However, the Senate quickly defeated it by a vote of 56 to 35. The defeat of the above two amendments brings the passage of this bill one step closer. Government Party leader Barkley then predicted that the Senate could pass this bill on Saturday night. He told reporters that he would try to get the Senate to hold sessions on Friday and Saturday nights to pass this bill. However, opposition leader Nye said that the final vote could not be held until next week. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>New York: A Gallup poll of young people aged 21 to 29 showed that 55% supported the Lend-Lease Act, 24% opposed it, 10% supported it with conditions, and 11% had no opinion. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Times greatly praised the unprecedented failure of the amendments to the Lend-Lease Act proposed by isolationists in the Senate yesterday, saying that it could indicate that the United States is moving towards genuine national unity. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: In the eleven-hour meeting last night, the power of the executive branch defeated the limited amendments to the Lend-Lease Act. The Senate reconvened at 11:00 a.m. today to continue debating the Lend-Lease Act and its amendments. In yesterday's meeting, the opposition's claim to prohibit the U.S. military from participating in foreign wars was broken by the power of the executive branch. The Senate adjourned at 9:35 p.m. last night (10:35 a.m. Shanghai time on the 8th) without holding the final vote on the Lend-Lease Act. Two amendments were passed in yesterday's meeting, and a total of twelve amendments have been passed in the past three days. The Senate will reconvene at 11:00 a.m. today. It is generally expected that the Lend-Lease Act may be completely passed.</p>
<p>U.S. Position Will Become More Clear in Expanding Aid to China and Strengthening Position Against Japan</p>
<p>Kentucky Democratic Senator and Majority Leader Barkley expressed his opinion before adjourning last night, requesting that debate be limited at Saturday's meeting. However, he also said that this restriction may only apply to the debate on the amendments. The debate on the Walsh amendment in the Senate yesterday focused on the situation in the Far East. This amendment was advocated by Massachusetts Democratic Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee. This amendment argued that U.S. warships should not be transferred without congressional approval. This amendment was the first issue of debate. Walsh said that he believes the situation in the Far East is very dangerous and that it would be unwise to allow the president to transfer warships stationed in the Pacific, as this would weaken the U.S. defense on the Far Eastern front. Other important military amendments include the one proposed by Ohio Republican Senator Taft, which limits U.S. aid to Greece, Britain, and Canada. This case directly raises a question, that is, whether the United States is willing to provide China with the same principled assistance and appropriations as it does to Britain and Greece. Congressional sources said they expect the debate on this issue to make the executive branch's adoption of expanding aid to China and strengthening its position against Japan more clear. Taft's reason for this argument is that the United States cannot simultaneously deal with enemies in the Atlantic and Pacific, and Hitler's threat to the United States is greater than Japan's. Taft's argument may receive the support of the majority. Also last night when the meeting adjourned, the Senate voted 49 to 36 to reject the Wiley amendment, which argued that any food needed by Britain should be purchased within the United States. The amendment was withdrawn after a sharp debate, because several Republicans from agricultural states said that the executive branch had planned to allow Britain to purchase beef, barley, and corn from Argentina. Taft believes that the executive branch is relying on this plan to purchase agricultural products from Argentina for supply. Butler, a Republican Senator from Nebraska, said during the meeting that American farmers resent the executive branch sacrificing American farmers to encourage agriculture in Argentina and Australia. The power of the executive branch also voted 53 to 48 to reject the Keer Amendment, which argued that none of the clauses in the Lend-Lease Act have the meaning of authorizing the president to inspect radio and newspapers. Taft also had an amendment that was rejected yesterday by a vote of 54 to 28. This amendment argued that all defense elements to be disposed of in the Lend-Lease Act should be produced or manufactured in the United States. Senator Barkley, the leader of the executive branch's power in the Senate, recently predicted that the Lend-Lease Act could be passed tonight with "no doubt." However, opponents of this bill still do not agree with Barkley's prediction. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Harriman to Go to London Tomorrow; U.S. Will Again Help Britain with Destroyers</p>
<p>Washington: Harriman is scheduled to leave for Britain on Monday. President Roosevelt met with him yesterday and gave him a letter of introduction to meet with British officials. The letter stated that Harriman is the President's personal representative, handling matters that facilitate material assistance to Britain and accelerate American aid. Aviation expert Warner and Army Ordnance Committee Vice Chairman Baylin will accompany Harriman to London. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: An International News Service reporter learned yesterday that after the Lend-Lease Act is passed, several U.S. warships, including minesweepers and destroyers, will be transferred to Britain. The details of the new transfer have not yet been finalized, but it is quite possible that U.S. warships will be exchanged for one or two British battleships. If President Roosevelt wants to make this exchange, the Navy Department has begun to seek congressional approval. Naval circles here say that this transaction is beneficial to both Britain and the United States. The United States needs battleships when building a two-ocean navy, because building battleships takes a long time. On the other hand, Britain has a large number of battleships, but in order to resist aggression, implement a blockade against Germany, and maintain the integrity of its commerce and ships, it relies on destroyers and minesweepers. Therefore, destroyers and minesweepers are what Britain needs most. (International News Service, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday that if the Lend-Lease Act is delayed by one day, the submission of war materials to democratic countries will also be delayed by one day. When reporters asked whether the current delay would have a serious impact, the President initially replied that he would rather not answer. Then he said that reporters should remember that when he submitted the bill to Congress, he stated that a delay in February or early February would not affect immediate aid to democratic countries, but the submission of war materials would be affected later. The President also asked that, at present, the United States has a lot of tin, but the source of tin is insufficient to supply the various needs of the sea, land, and air forces and civil affairs.

<p>Moscow: Soviet astronomers and geologists have been conducting extremely important work over the past fifteen years to explore more accurate estimates regarding the constitution and shape of the Earth. Professor Karakovskiy, who is in charge of this work, told a TASS reporter, "In the past few years, Soviet Arctic explorers such as Papanin have been working in previously undiscovered locations. They have made every effort to observe astronomical geology, etc. From the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean, there are traces of their footsteps. What they have discovered has greatly assisted Soviet scientists and geographers. Soviet scientists have determined that the distance from the center of the Earth to the equator is 6,378.240 meters, which is 148 meters shorter than that determined by the American Hayford. As for the distance from the center of the Earth to the poles, it is also shorter than currently stipulated. Therefore, it is necessary to correct the degree of compression at the poles. The above findings are of great assistance to air and sea navigation." (Seventh TASS dispatch)</p>

<p>New York: Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka Yosuke will travel to Germany tomorrow or within the next few days. This news was transmitted from Shanghai by the famous American journalist Weigang. Weigang is the foreign news director of the Hearst newspapers and recently met in Tokyo. He quoted Matsuoka as confirming the news he had transmitted. At this time of turbulence in the Pacific and Europe, Matsuoka's quick trip to Berlin is of great significance. Therefore, this news has caused a stir in Washington. According to Weigang, Japanese Prime Minister Konoe will concurrently manage the affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, assisted by Vice Minister Oashi. The German Ambassador to Japan, General Ott, will travel with Matsuoka. Matsuoka told Weigang, "If I can spare the time, I may leave Tokyo on Sunday to visit Hitler, Mussolini, Ribbentrop, and Ciano in Berlin and Rome and discuss matters with them." Matsuoka said that this trip was not a temporary decision. After Japan joined the Axis last year, it accepted the invitation from Germany and Italy in September and warned not to overdo publicity or engage in speculation. When asked if Matsuoka would travel to Germany via the Soviet Union, Weigang asked if he would take the opportunity to discuss Soviet-Japanese relations, even a non-aggression pact, while passing through Moscow. Matsuoka said, "This trip is to return the invitation from Germany and Italy, and meeting with Stalin is not on the agenda." Matsuoka also did not want to go to Vichy to meet with Petain. He told Weigang that he was eager to see the demeanor of Hitler, Mussolini, and their foreign ministers and hoped to meet with other military leaders. Matsuoka also said that he expected to return to Tokyo before the end of April. Since Japan joined the Tripartite Pact, this is the first time that its cabinet members have visited the Axis leaders. (Eighth International News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Reliable sources say that although Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka is preparing to go to Berlin or Rome, the main purpose of this trip is to make efforts to conclude a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact. Another reason for this trip is to clarify Japan's relationship with the Axis, especially in the Far East. It is understood that Matsuoka had already considered this trip, but it could not be realized earlier due to the prolonged Thai-Vietnamese border dispute. According to reliable sources, Matsuoka will travel to Europe on the same Siberian train as the German Ambassador to Japan, Wotte. Wotte left Tokyo this afternoon. It is understood that Matsuoka is still considering this trip, but it is believed that he can still make it now because the negotiations on the Thai-Vietnamese border dispute, which have been delayed for more than a month, will reach an agreement tomorrow. Observers believe that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' announcement of the appointment of former Finance Minister Aoki as an economic advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is quite important. Aoki and another advisor will be responsible for handling the affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs during Matsuoka's absence from the country. The other two advisors are former Ambassador to Italy, Shiratori, and Dr. Saito of the South Manchuria Railway Company. (Eighth Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The news from Tokyo that Matsuoka is considering going to Berlin has further intensified the tension in US-Japan relations. Impartial sources believe that this news may speed up the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. Diplomatic circles believe that Tokyo has allowed rumors of Matsuoka's trip to Europe to leak out in the past two weeks as a test. However, political circles say that the news from Tokyo is a new manifestation of Japanese-German cooperation against the United States. The response to this pressure will be to make the United States take a tougher stance and not succumb. Well-informed sources say that the Senate is now voting on major amendments to the Lend-Lease Act. Therefore, from Japan's point of view, the news of Matsuoka's trip to Germany is particularly untimely. (Eighth Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<p>London: A Reuters special correspondent from Abyssinia reported that British forces and patriotic Abyssinian forces are still attacking Addis Ababa (i.e., the Abyssinian capital) in twelve routes, and have repeatedly won victories. Their food is mainly obtained from the Italian forces. In addition to the South African army repeatedly achieving victories in Italian Somaliland, the Battle of Keren is currently receiving the most attention. British and Free French forces are advancing rapidly to the back of the Italian garrison attached to Keren, so the Italian garrison is in increasing danger of having its retreat cut off. In central Abyssinia, Australian and British officers, together with the Abyssinian army, have crossed Mancosa (eight miles east of Boi). The Italian forces on the Boi front abandoned a large amount of food and supplies. On Wednesday, the British forces captured more than 20 vehicles, 4 artillery pieces, and several machine guns on this line. On Tuesday, the Italian forces withdrew from Boi, and that night their barracks were repeatedly harassed by patriotic Abyssinian forces, who could not rest. On Wednesday morning, the Italian forces retreated under the cover of artillery fire and a remnant Italian aircraft from the Abyssinian Air Force, and were attacked by the British forces. Soon, an Italian Caproni aircraft was shot down, presumably the Italian aircraft that was carrying out the cover. Some of the patriotic Abyssinian forces north of Lake Tana have coordinated with the vanguard around Chirga (on the main road from Gallabat to Gedaref) to help attack the enemy forces around Gedaref.

<h3 id="e24">British Admiralty Announces Details of the Raid on the Lofoten Islands: 18,000 Tons of Enemy Ships Sunk; 215 German Soldiers Captured; Norwegian Puppet Government to Be Established <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>London: The official announcement of the details of the British army's attack on the Lofoten Islands off the coast of northern Norway on Tuesday stated that the British army's attack was very successful, and there was very little resistance. In addition to capturing ten "Quisling elements", 215 German soldiers were also captured. The Norwegian army, together with the British army, landed on the Lofoten Islands and sank a total of about 18,000 tons of enemy ships, including nine German merchant ships and Norwegian merchant ships controlled by the German side. Also, a general German armed fishing boat was also sunk. According to Norwegian government officials, the Norwegian soldiers participating in the attack on the Lofoten Islands were Norwegian naval soldiers who had received land warfare training in England. When the British and Norwegian troops arrived on the islands by ship, they used large loudspeakers to broadcast to the islanders, saying that their friends were close at hand and were willing to carry them on board if they volunteered to go to England to serve in the Norwegian Free Army. Within moments, hundreds of young people returned home, hurriedly packed their bags, and lined up on the coast. There were more than 300 of these patriotic Norwegians, and few of them were married. Most of them were young people who wanted to join the British Air Force. The British raid on the Lofoten Islands took less than one or two hours to complete. Among the captured German soldiers, one told a Reuters reporter at the Northern Railway Station (speaking broken English) that he and others were surrounded by landing British sailors and could not resist. After thirty or forty minutes, the British army had achieved its attack objective. The German prisoners were in good spirits, while the ten Quisling elements were crestfallen.

<p>London: The Norwegian News Agency reported that the Nazi-appointed Quisling-led party has now openly abandoned its pretext of fighting for Norwegian independence. Now, speakers of the party are talking about the Greater Teutonic Empire under German control, and even expressing that German troops will be permanently stationed in Norway. The party is also advocating the restoration of the ancient system, with German Yingbao as the commercial center of Northern Europe, and making Norway a German economic appendage. The Norwegian Northern Volunteer Legion is now openly referred to as a German Legion and will be controlled by the German side to fight against Britain and the Allied countries together with the German army. In other words, the Norwegian Quisling traitors will promote Norwegians to fight against their compatriots. However, although the German side is doing its best to recruit, the number of applicants is very small. Quisling's Chief of Police Lai, worried about his own future, has recently arrested hundreds of people in Bergen and Oslo. Even though these people have stepped up their oppression, patriotic Norwegians continue to oppose the propaganda of Quisling and the Germans. (Eighth Reuters dispatch)</p>

Forty years ago, he was a famous educator in Manila and served as an officer there for a long time. It is said that, in view of the current intolerable situation in Liaodong, Congress should urgently issue a declaration in the form of an ultimatum, urging the Japanese army to withdraw from various parts of Southeast Asia, otherwise, prepare for an attack by the American fleet. It is now too dangerous for the American fleet to be stationed in the Philippines. If it is sent to Singapore, it will be regarded by Japan as an act of war.

<p>Yesterday, Tung Wah lived up to expectations, overturning all predictions, defeating Portugal six to three. Nine thousand fans in the Recreation Ground smiled contentedly. The score was tied two to two at halftime. Yesterday, the Westerners defeated the Jewish team six to zero at the Racecourse. In Group A, they still lead Tung Wah by one point.

<p>Proper Control, Excellent Performance</p>
<p>Tung Wah's excellent performance yesterday was the second time this year it has been seen. With a formidable enemy in front of them, Dai Linjing arrived on short notice. Although Li Ning and Cai Shengmiao did not play, the arrangement of the lineup was very proper. This was the primary reason for yesterday's victory. Li Yichen retreated to the back, preventing Favan Chiao from being active. Today's Li Yichen is truly a defensive talent, not a forward. Huang Kehou was originally a good forward, but after this adjustment, each played to their strengths, forming a tacit understanding. Meanwhile, Portuguese goalkeeper Souza's goalkeeping was subpar, and the two defenders were too weak. The defeat yesterday was their responsibility. Oliveira in the center has the style of Costa, and together with Ghion, they can be called two heroes. The whole field was full of praise.</p>
<p>Missed Penalty, Omen of Failure</p>
<p>The Portuguese team attacked first. Liang Shutang got a free kick 30 yards out, with a muffled sound, the ball flew straight to the Portuguese goal, where it was caught by Souza. Not long after, Fei Chunhua hooked the ball into the center, and Wan Jin shot wide. The Portuguese team counterattacked, and Corazza's shot was caught by Qin, turning danger into safety. At twelve minutes, Tung Wah's Youliang and Fei Chunhua went straight down the right wing. Fei's shot missed, Souza fell to the ground, caught the ball and lost it again. Wan Jin took the opportunity to catch up and kick the ball and the man into the net, one to zero, taking the lead. Unexpectedly, at twenty-one minutes, Li Yichen rushed out to increase the offensive, but failed to return in time. Favan Chiao dribbled deep and shot hard, hitting Souza in the crowd and sending the ball into the net, tying the score. Five minutes later, Liang Shutang carelessly tripped Ghion in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. Ghion shot into the corner of the net, but unfortunately, Corazza rushed into the white line too early. The penalty kick was retaken, and Ghion shot lightly to the side. Tung Wah celebrated, but another wave rose. At thirty-six minutes, Han Longhai jumped up to catch the ball and slapped it with his hand. The penalty kick was inevitable. V. Souza took the kick, sweeping into the left corner of the net, two to one, the Portuguese team took the lead. Not many minutes later, Portugal's Rocha committed a foul about thirty yards away. Li Yichen took the free kick, flying the ball into the net, tying the score at two all. The first half then came to an end.</p>
<p>Tung Wah's Momentum Unstoppable</p>
<p>Changing sides to fight again, Tung Wah controlled the overall situation throughout, with a formidable momentum, unstoppable. Fei Chunhua dribbled straight down, and was blocked by C. Remedios into a corner kick. Fei's kick was excellent, falling along the goal line. Souza didn't catch it, and Huang Kehou headed it into the goal, making it three to two, Tung Wah leading. Four minutes later, Dai Linjing passed the ball to the right, and Fei Chunhua cut in and shot. M. Souza pushed the ball into the net, forming an own goal, four to two, Tung Wah leading far ahead. The Portuguese team launched another counterattack. Favan Chiao darted into the penalty area and passed to the center. Zhuang Youren kicked the ball not far away, and Oliveira shot from 30 yards out. Qin did not defend, and conceded the goal, making it three to four, one goal behind, the situation was very tense. Youliang and Fei Chunhua worked especially hard. Fei Chunhua passed the ball to Huang Kehou, who headed it in, landing in Souza's hands. Then, Dai Linjing passed it to the left, Huang Kehou dribbled the ball up, and Oliveira failed to block him. Huang advanced alone, scoring the goal, making it five to three. The Portuguese team showed no improvement. Finally, Fei Chunhua took another corner kick, repeating the old trick, the landing point was still in front of the goal, Huang Kehou waited for the right moment, and flicked his head, scoring the goal, making it six to three. The statutory time ended, and Tung Wah defeated Portugal six to three.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Rice Soars, Large Quantities of Foreign Rice Continuously Arrive in Shanghai, Rice Prices Soar Again by Five to Six Yuan, Foreign Rice Premiums Reach 2,500 Yuan, All Rice and Grain are Rare and Profitable Commodities <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The price of foreign rice rose again on the market yesterday. Not only were high-priced goods rare and popular, but even medium-grade and broken rice were regarded as rare treasures, allowing prices to be raised at will. For example, mixed Saigon broken rice was even being offered at a premium of 1,000 yuan and 1,200-1,300 yuan per white picul (石). No. 4 broken rice (160 catties) was also being offered at 80 yuan. No. 1 old Saigon rice was being offered at a premium of 1,200-1,300 yuan per hundred piculs, and new Saigon rice at a premium of 2,100-2,200 yuan. Small grains were most welcomed by speculators, initially at a premium of 2,100 yuan per hundred bags, followed by 200 yuan, 300 yuan, up to 2,500 yuan. For example, Yinghua brand rice, which was originally 92 yuan, was increased to 117 yuan in huge amounts. In one day, it rose by another five or six yuan per dan (担). Therefore, the rice market has become an uncontrollable situation. Holders of goods are speaking nonsense, asking for prices to the sky, while speculators and importers are also desperately absorbing livestock, making the black market higher and better, in order to have extra profits. There are frequent reports in the newspaper about strictly cracking down on black market premiums, but in fact, nothing is being done. Investigating rice reserves and cracking down on hoarding is like looking for centipedes under the tiger's head, daring not to take action. Moreover, they are all financially well-off, with vast connections. Thousands of tons is not too much, and ten thousand bags is too little. This forces millions of wage earners to buy rice but not have oil, like ants on a hot stone, crying bitterly. But watching and not saving, remaining silent, seems like a charming person, but it is not the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Looking at foreign rice, there is still a large amount arriving in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taikoo company's Kunming wheel, transported 9,397 bags from Siam and another 3,057 bags from Hong Kong. This wheel transported a total of 12,454 bags of foreign rice from the two locations, berthing at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Fulux wheel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, transporting 2,867 bags from Hong Kong, berthing at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Also, the French company's Jindiya wheel, directly carrying a large batch of foreign rice from Saigon, is expected to arrive today. Also, the Pougville is also loading rice from Saigon to Shanghai, expected to arrive in the next few days. Today, the American mail ship President Pias arrived in port, transporting 8,000 bags of broken rice from the United States, which is a donation from the United States to relieve the famine, to be distributed by the Red Cross. (Zu)</p>
<p>Looking at the rising trend of domestic rice, it became more and more intense yesterday, with a tendency to rise straight to the clouds. With multiple parties competing to purchase, it became even more insufficient to distribute. Hoarding and speculation became even more chaotic. The shouts of prices jumped by several yuan at a time, and buyers only sought to get the goods, regardless of the high price. Therefore, the result was that whether thick or thin japonica rice, prices continued to soar by as much as four yuan. Kunshan japonica rice was quoted at 114 yuan per peck, followed by 111 yuan, the original package at 117.5 yuan, followed by 116 yuan. Qingjiao thin rice was quoted at 111.5 yuan per peck, followed by 119.5 yuan, the original package at 115-116 yuan. Although glutinous rice did not have as much demand as other goods, the market was also scarce, and the situation was tight. Hong Kong rice was quoted at 99 yuan, followed by 98.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Stimulated by Foreign Rice, Flour Prices Soar - But Arrivals Continue <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the upward trend continued strongly, severely stimulated by the rice market. Local merchants and hoarders were quite active. Although orders for foreign flour and transshipments from Hong Kong arrived continuously, people were concerned about future problems, disregarding the livelihood of the public and the safety of the entire city. Furthermore, Chinese factories were selling flour at low prices because the newly arrived foreign wheat was still being dried and processed, fearing that supply could not be restored by the beginning of next week. Therefore, local retailers and hoarders bought in succession, and prices rose immediately by forty to fifty cents. Prices included Clock Tower Flower Bird Brand Australian flour at twenty-nine yuan seventy-five cents, Beautiful Brand at twenty-nine yuan ninety cents, Golden Dragon Brand Canadian flour at twenty-eight yuan ninety cents, and Yellow Ox Brand at twenty-eight yuan thirty-five to forty-five cents. In the afternoon, the price rose to twenty-eight yuan seventy cents. However, it was said that profit-taking bulls emerged midway, so the market was in a state of turbulence.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour: Continuous imports have been reported repeatedly in this newspaper. It is now known that the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Fu vessel arrived at the port. In addition to foreign rice shipped from Hong Kong, there were also 2,198 bags of flour, which have already been unloaded. (Zu)</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the market was as quiet as usual. Newly arrived foreign wheat was still being dried and processed due to dampness. Chinese factories, despite being in need, were temporarily not interested in buying. Although Japanese factories were taking deliveries, domestic wheat reserves were nearly exhausted, and there was no supply to purchase. Amidst the rising rice and flour prices, goods owners were hoarding and refusing to sell, so the market became increasingly quiet.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Miscellaneous Grains and Oilseed Cakes - Major Price Surge <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for miscellaneous grains and oilseed cakes was completely dominated by speculators. The market situation was chaotic, the atmosphere was almost frenzied, and the price surge was sharp, causing public anxiety. Throughout the day's trading, speculative transactions accounted for ninety-five percent of the volume, while actual sales were only a small amount. Therefore, the overall situation resembled the tense atmosphere of a world war, reaching an extreme. As a result, soybean oil soared by five and a half yuan, raw oil continued to rise by two to three yuan, soybeans increased by one to two yuan, red beans jumped over the forty-yuan mark, reaching a corner, yellow rice rose by two to three yuan, and oilseed cake also reached four to five corners. Currently, the prices of various goods are soaring and jumping without end, and people do not know what the future holds. The livelihood of ordinary people is a cause for concern.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 1,500 tins of raw oil arrived in Shanghai from Yantai, and another 2,500 tins from Qingdao. Today, 170 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Hong Kong, 6,700 bags to Singapore, and 140 bags to Luzon Island. 11,300 pieces of oilseed cake are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, due to Saturday being a half-day trading session, the market remained stable after a period of potential volatility. The market opened slightly softer in the morning, but after news that China, Britain, and the United States would establish an economic agreement and that the United States would provide further loans to China, speculators and Japanese banks successively sold off, causing the spot US dollar to weaken to 5.53125 yuan. Eventually, the market returned to a stable level due to absorption by foreign banks such as HSBC. At the close of the market, British gold was priced at 3 pence 375, hard silver at 15625, and the US dollar was stable, remaining at 5.5 yuan. Trading was quiet.</p>
<p>Japanese Banks Sell Off</p>
<p>In the morning, the London price for spot and forward large bars was flat, and the New York silver price was also flat.

The US dollar appreciated by 25 against the British pound, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and had no market against the French franc. The Central Bank's listed rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The opening spot selling prices of banks in the morning were flat at 3 pence 359375 for British gold and 5.5 yuan for the US dollar. However, after the opening, the spot US dollar briefly fell to 5.46875 yuan, a slight tightening of 03125. After HSBC's listed rates were announced, the market suddenly stiffened as Japanese banks sold off. It is estimated that spot US dollars were sold to HSBC at 5.53125 yuan, and speculators also sold off. However, foreign banks were still willing to absorb the supply, so prices did not continue to fall. It is estimated that foreign banks absorbed the March US dollar against Shanghai at a price of 5.53125 yuan. By noon, the market seemed to be unsettled, and the market had returned to a stable level. The spot and current month prices for British gold were 3 pence 375, the March price was 3 pence 359375, the spot price for the US dollar was 5.5 yuan, the current month price was 5.46875, and the March price was 5.4375.

<h3 id="e52">US Loan to China - Gold Market Continues to Fall <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for refined gold continued to decline slightly, once breaking below 6,300 yuan. However, after hearing that China, Britain, and the United States would establish an economic agreement and that the United States would provide further loans to China, market sentiment stabilized. Therefore, under the pressure of selling due to exhaustion, the market fell from an opening price of 6,340 yuan to 6,295 yuan. Gold shops and exchange merchants absorbed the supply, and at noon, the market closed at 6,320 yuan, a decrease of 11 yuan. The half-day trading volume was 7,000 to 8,000 taels. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday. Cash was provided by Gonghe and Xianghe, each issuing 120 taels, at a price 420 yuan higher than the forward price. The prices of gold ornaments and customs gold were all flat.</p>
<p>Refined Gold Sees Extremely Minor Fluctuations</p>
<p>In the early morning, there was no shortage of buyers, and sales were slightly constrained, so the opening price was more than 10 yuan higher than the previous day, at 6,340 yuan. Unexpectedly, Dafeng, Chengji, Gonghe, Defu, and others successively sold off, and the exchange rate also tightened, gradually falling below the 6,300 yuan mark. However, it only fell to 6,295 yuan. Eventually, as the supply and demand of foreign exchange turned flat, and market sentiment inevitably harbored bullish psychology, after being absorbed by Hui Kangyong, Xinfengyong, Chengji, and others, it returned above the 6,300 yuan mark, reaching 6,328 yuan. Subsequently, the market became particularly sluggish, and fluctuations narrowed. The closing price was 6,320 yuan, a decrease of 11 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. Settled at 5.46875 yuan for the March US dollar, which was still 1,368 yuan. It is estimated to be a drop of 48 yuan. The closing price was 6,315 yuan. There was a fluctuation of 45 yuan in the first half of the day. The selling price of the local brand of gold for cash shops was about 445 yuan higher than the forward price of refined gold, and the buying price was reduced by 80 yuan. There was no price or market for spot gold.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Exchange Rate Unchanged</p>
<p>The exchange price for gold jewelry in silver shops remained at 690 yuan per tael, with a reduction of 40 yuan for purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Mixed Fluctuations in Foreign Currencies <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw a slight decline in the refined gold spot price and continued struggles in the cash price. Therefore, the British and American gold pounds both continued to fall by 1 yuan. The British gold note tended to be stable, and the market price remained flat. The changes in the American gold note were still small, eventually closing at 18 yuan and 5 cents, a decrease of 1 cent compared to the previous day. There was slightly more demand for Hong Kong notes, and the market price rose slightly. There was no shortage of demand for Japanese and Korean gold notes, and the market prices continued to rise, with the former rising to 1 yuan and 90 cents and the latter reaching 1 yuan and 55 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Weight of Diamonds <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— A Digest</p>
<p>Recently, I saw someone in the Economic Forum asking when the measurement of diamonds was changed to 200 milligrams per carat. According to my research, this standard, which is based on the metric system, was established in 1932 and is now commonly used by jewelers in various countries. Before this, the weight of each carat of diamond varied from country to country. For example, Madras was 207.3539 milligrams, Vienna was 206.13 milligrams, or 205.7 milligrams, Frankfurt was 205.77 milligrams, Brazil and Portugal were 205.75 milligrams, Germany was 205.5 milligrams, the United Kingdom was 204.09 milligrams, Spain was 205.393 milligrams, and the Netherlands was 205.044 or 206.3 milligrams. With this standard, the measurement of diamonds began to be unified.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Securities - Domestic Bonds Suddenly Rise <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday for the over-the-counter market for government bonds. The transactions from the afternoon before were cleared at 9 AM. Trading began at 11 AM. At that time, rumors of an economic agreement between China, Britain, and the United States and new loans from China and Britain were circulating. In the morning session, prices rose sharply by more than one yuan. Type C bonds opened at 65.9 yuan and rose to 6 yuan and 9 cents. Inside the market, many parties took the opportunity to push prices up. Those who rely on hearsay instead of seeing things for themselves shifted from short to long positions. This kind of price surge was entirely due to the large number of short positions in the market. Taking advantage of the fact that Saturday was only a half-day trading session, the majority of short positions blindly covered their positions. Retail investors mostly bought in as the market rose. The technique of spreading rumors was then used to sell, watching Type C bonds rise in a straight line, surging by one yuan and twenty to thirty cents. By the time the market closed, Type E bonds had only risen by 65 cents, and Type D bonds had only traded one price, and the price was only good for 5 cents. If the situation was truly positive, the market prices for Type E and Type D bonds would be much more favorable than those for Type C bonds when the market closed, and everyone would compete to buy them. Why would no one care about them? Looking at the buyers yesterday, various parties did not have much power. Tongxingsheng, Dalianhe, Sankailianyi, Dunyu, Yongchang, Yongkang, and Hengfu took the opportunity to sell at high prices and obtained good prices. Therefore, the trading floor turned out to be weak, and the number of short positions on the trading floor was greatly reduced, which was not a blessing for the long positions. Yesterday, excluding the winning lottery calculation for Type B bonds, because the lottery draw will be held on the 10th, the market price was only good for 5 cents. Type C bonds surged by one yuan and twenty cents, and the rest were only good for 50 to 70 cents. The transaction volume was 1.5 million to 1.6 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 100 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 19.75 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 7th (Friday) dispatch: Today, the listed market prices for Chinese foreign bonds and shares of British companies in the Far East remained flat. Only the shares of British banks showed improvement. The shares of Mercantile Bank continued to rise by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with a price of 8 pounds 12 shillings and 6 pence. The shares of HSBC registered in London rose by 1 pound, with a price of 75 pounds. The shares registered in Hong Kong rose by half a pound, with a price of 77 pounds. There was a market but no trading. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>Wheelock Marden Declares Interim Dividend</p>
<p>The Xiao Manqishi Rubber Company of Huitong Foreign Firm had a profit of over 241,000 yuan in national currency for the year 1940. A dividend of 40 cents in national currency was distributed per share. The 31st annual shareholders' meeting will be held on March 21st. The British company Wheelock Marden Limited decided to continue to pay the second interim dividend of 5 yuan in national currency per share for the year ending March 31, 1941, and it will be paid on March 31st.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Yarn and Cotton - Inventory Gradually Increases - Yarn Prices Cannot Be Optimistic - Only Short-Term Speculation <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is soft with a hint of firmness. The overall situation remains in a state of fluctuation. This is because there is still no sign of progress in actual transactions. As for inventory, it is gradually increasing. In this situation, not only can we not be optimistic, but there is a possibility of a decline. However, most of the industry is in a long position and are buying in anticipation of price increases, so they are absorbing chips and not releasing them. Therefore, the confrontation between the long and short positions is fierce, and the market shows a hesitant state. The high price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,357 yuan, and the low price was 1,346 yuan. In the afternoon, speculators dispersed and there was no market due to the weekend. Today, 230 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The morning opening market situation for Double Horse yarn was ordinary. The opening price was 1,350 yuan. After a short while, it slightly decreased to 1,346 yuan. At this time, buyers increased slightly, and the price returned to above 1,350 yuan. However, the transaction volume in the market was small, fluctuating between 48 yuan and 53.4 yuan five or six times. The market situation was very dispersed. Midway, it was heard that gold prices had fallen, and the price retreated downwards once. However, the closing price was 1,356 yuan. The statistical data of the transaction volume by each group was 7,185 bales, which is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Cotton Market Difficult to Reinvigorate - 1,500 Bales of American Cotton Arrive <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is becoming increasingly depressed. Because factories are even less active on the weekend, and the yarn market is declining, market sentiment is cold. Therefore, there is little hope for any improvement in the cotton market.</p>
<p>The New York cotton market is doing well due to the favorable cotton cloth trade, the good political situation, and the rumors that the government will provide further loans. Therefore, the buying intentions of various parties are quite active, and the market is surging continuously. As a result, the closing prices are 5 to 9 pound sounds higher than the previous day. In contrast, the Indian cotton market is flat. Except for Ohm village, which rose by 2.5 Robi, there was no significant change in yesterday's forecasts.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton transaction remains as sluggish as ever. In this turbulent situation, it is difficult to expect a resurgence in the market.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the reduction in ships, the import of Indian cotton has also been affected. The Norwegian ship Dapu shipped 1,600 bales from Burma at the beginning of the month, as reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that the American mail ship President Pierce will arrive tonight with 1,500 bales of American cotton, berthing at floating docks 12 and 13 for unloading and transshipment.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market rose slightly because the price of Eastern cloth rebounded, market sentiment improved, and much absorption occurred at low prices. The selling price of fine cloth and fine twill increased by 25 to 50 cents per piece, and the price of coarse cloth increased by 25 cents per piece. There were few changes in the price of bleached and dyed cloth. The transaction volume of various cloths in this street was over 500 pieces. The Zhejiang Road, Wenzhou, Yongtai merchants transacted over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. The Fujian merchants transacted over 100 pieces of bleached cloth, poplin, striped bleached blue cloth, and other goods.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The market continued to rise. The prices of white cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill increased by 25 to 50 cents per piece. The current price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth in stock is 45.9 yuan. Medium-fine cloths are all above 46 yuan, and the situation is gradually stabilizing. The morning market closing price for Four Gentlemen's Serge was 1.3 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: 410 pieces of cotton cloth will be shipped to Hong Kong today (9th), and another 263 pieces will be shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Feather Yarn Sells Well <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Feather yarn has different types, such as twill, plain, and mercerized. Twill is more widely used in the second half of the year, plain has more demand in the first half of the year, and mercerized feather yarn sells well in all seasons. Twill and plain are mostly imported, while mercerized feather yarn is entirely domestic products woven in Shanghai. Initially, it was mostly used for lining Western suits, but in recent years, it has also become popular for lining Chinese clothing, and sales have increased even more. Because buyers and customers alike welcome cheap and durable products. Retail sales have been particularly brisk recently. Waxed thread generally sells for 25 cents, 2 yuan 25 cents for waxed thread, 1 yuan 80 to 90 cents for low-end goods, 15 yuan for plain feather yarn, and 16 yuan for twill.</p>

<p>Although the arrival of Hongji white coal has been brisk recently, since the price of bituminous coal has increased, general factories have also switched to using white coal to save costs. Therefore, sales have suddenly become booming. Traders are afraid that buyers will hoard, so they have restricted ordering, and the unofficial market price has risen suddenly. The old orders from fellow traders have already been quoted at 280 yuan, but it is still not easy to obtain. The price for screened lumps in this street's shops is 296 yuan per ton, limited to available trucks, and no pre-orders are accepted.</p>

<p>The market for ribbed steel has previously declined for a while. However, recently, due to the increasingly tense situation in the Pacific, although the stock in this street has not seen to be thin, market sentiment is bullish, and the standard has rebounded to 50 to 60 yuan per ton. Yesterday's quoted prices, such as 3/4 inch and coarser sizes, were all sold for 2,100 yuan per ton. It is reported that the construction industry absorbed dozens of tons. In addition, hoarding groups did a little embellishment, but the number was not large. In addition, 355 iron plates were shipped from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>

<p>The soap market is experiencing an alarming price surge. Because factories have no goods to supply, those who hold the goods are tightening sales prices, and the market price is rising sharply. Yesterday, for example, Guben soap was priced as high as 45 yuan per box, Baixiangmao soap was 39 yuan per box, Huangxiangmao soap was 31 yuan per box, and Scissor soap was 32 yuan per box.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Victory Speech - Shanghai Public Opinion Unanimously Trusts - Western Newspapers Comment that It Is Absolutely Not an Exaggeration - Allied Nations Will Definitely Continue to Step Up Assistance <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered a speech at a banquet hosting the National Political Council members on the 5th of this month, expressing optimism about military, diplomatic, and financial issues, and firmly believing that China will be able to achieve final victory independently. Since the disclosure of this speech, various Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai have successively published articles commenting on it, unanimously believing that what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek expressed is by no means an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Thanking Allied Nations for Actual Assistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury wrote in yesterday's editorial that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech to the National Political Council, affirming his confidence in the final victory, is extremely sufficient to make those who are not firm in their beliefs strengthen their will. At the same time, it avoids the excessive optimism of a part of the Chinese people. In his speech, the Chairman especially emphasized China's ability to fight on its own and achieve victory, without completely relying on the assistance of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. However, he also pointed out that this path is not smooth and flat, and must go through immeasurable hardships. Chiang thanked the allied nations for their friendship and assistance, but did not hope that they would be drawn into the war. What China requires is only assistance in the form of friendship.</p>
<p>Unite as One and Strive Outward</p>
<p>Many people in China often feel that a war between the United States and Japan is inevitable. Once this happens, the internal unity will inevitably weaken. Another group of people believe that Britain and the United States will eventually join the Chinese war that has lasted for four years, at which time China will have an opportunity to clear its internal affairs. The errors of these two theories have now been dispelled by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech. At this time, when the victory of the war is approaching, any hesitation or thought of stopping is inevitably a path to failure. In the event of internal turmoil, it will not only fail to attract foreign aid, but also cut off existing foreign aid. Therefore, at this moment, China should continue to unite as one and strive outward, serving as a force for the democratic countries in the Asian region.</p>
<p>Chiang's Remarks Are Absolutely Not an Exaggeration</p>
<p>The China Press commented that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech delivered in Chongqing on the 5th was quite confident. After listening to his great speech, our confidence cannot help but arise spontaneously. Since Chiang Kai-shek became the leader of the Chinese nation, he has never made exaggerated remarks or used clever sophistry. His every word has been carefully considered, citing facts, simple and unadorned. This is why the people admire and trust him. Moreover, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has never disappointed the Chinese people. Therefore, when he said in his speech on the 5th that China can rely on its own strength to achieve final victory, no one deeply believes that this is an exaggeration or insincere.</p>
<p>Belief in Victory Expresses Sympathy</p>
<p>China did not hope to rely on external forces from the beginning of the war. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly clarified this. Now that China has attracted Japan to its expected position, its desire for the United States or the Soviet Union to participate in the war is undoubtedly even weaker. What China requires is that the United States, the Soviet Union, and Britain can continue to provide material assistance to China. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek firmly believes that all allied nations will never compromise with Japan and can strictly maintain neutrality, and will never put China at a disadvantage. Most observers share Chairman Chiang's confidence. If Japan cannot defeat China in three years, then it can be said that it will not be able to defeat China even in thirty years. Chinese nationalism has traditionally been unbreakable. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek knows this very well, and it is feared that Japan will soon discover this point as well.</p>

<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 5th of this month. He originally planned to travel to Singapore in two weeks. According to a reporter's inquiry to relevant parties, the Ambassador will not leave Shanghai for the short term due to busy official duties. It is believed that the Ambassador has had a lot of contact regarding the upcoming election of the municipal council, which is being prepared.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the March 8th International Women's Day. The women's community in Shanghai, with the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction approaching the final victory stage, the celebratory mood was especially exhilarating. In order to support national policy and practice the responsibilities of women in wartime, they are working hard in their respective positions, following the New Life Movement's principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame, and the national public morality of national supremacy and ethnic supremacy, and striving forward with perseverance. The women's community originally planned to prepare a women's library for this Women's Day. It is now learned that the children's library prepared by various cultural groups in Shanghai is in progress. This matter is also closely related to women, so it was decided to start promoting it after the establishment of the children's library to avoid fragmentation and concentrate efforts. They will also continue to promote donating for festivals, purchasing savings bonds and wartime public bonds, and promoting national construction. The members of various women's organizations hold gatherings more frequently to encourage each other. Furthermore, on the Occupational Women's Day on the 11th of this month, Chinese and foreign occupational women's organizations in Shanghai will hold a memorial meeting at the Naval YMCA on Sichuan Road to review and promote women's occupations and improve women's welfare.</p>
<h3 id="e69">The President Pierce Arrives in Port Tonight - Some American Nationals Retreat - More Than Two Hundred People Return to the United States on the Vessel - British Side Hopes Nationals Will Take Similar Action <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The President Pierce, a steamship of the American President Lines, will arrive in port today. The previous newspaper already reported this. Yesterday, the company announced that the arrival time and departure date of the steamship have been delayed again. The original plan was to arrive in port at 9:30 AM this morning, but it has been changed to 10:00 PM tonight, berthing at floating docks 12 and 13. Passengers will transfer to a small boat and board at the new customs wharf at 11:00 PM tonight. The delay of the vessel in Shanghai</p>
<p>Is 36 Hours</p>
<p>It is scheduled to set sail at 9:45 AM on the 11th, heading via Honolulu and San Francisco back to Los Angeles. The last small boat for passengers will depart from the new customs wharf at 8:15 AM on the 11th. This time, the vessel came to Shanghai from the Americas and Southeast Asia. The number of passengers landing in Shanghai included 73 in first and second class and 38 in third class, for a total of 111 people. The total number of passengers traveling from Shanghai on the original vessel to the United States was 168 people. Approximately 200 American nationals will board the vessel in Shanghai to return to their country. In addition, 1,500 bales of cotton and 8,000 bags of broken rice were shipped from the United States, which are American donations for relief and were previously mistaken for American wheat. As for the retreat</p>
<p>Of Far Eastern British Nationals</p>
<p>Is actively underway. Those residing in "Manchukuo" and various parts of North China have also packed their bags and left the country. As for the British nationals in Shanghai, the British Nationals Association has come forward to assist with everything. Since the arrival of British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr in Shanghai, he has been particularly concerned about this matter. Because the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly tense, and the number of British ships and their capacity on the Far East coast are decreasing even further, the British Ambassador deeply hopes that his country's nationals will retreat in a timely manner to avoid being caught off guard and in a panic.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Increased Ferry Service for Rice Transport <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The French mail ship "Gindidia," carrying rice from Saigon to Shanghai, is expected to arrive here at 8:00 AM today after passing through the Haiphong sea defense. It will dock at the Huashun Wharf, carrying 12,500 bags of tribute rice. Following this, the Dada Nan will also arrive in Shanghai carrying a large consignment of rice. The shipping route between Haiphong and Shanghai, maintained by French ships instead of British ships, is expected to continue regardless of how the Far East situation deteriorates, according to shipping industry sources. The supply of rice to Shanghai should be uninterrupted. It is reported that the number of French cargo ships has increased from four to twelve, with an average of three or four ships arriving in Shanghai each month, carrying rice.</p>
<p>Rice Market Price Subsidies: Secret Deals Become Public</p>
<p>The rice market is in chaos, with the practice of price subsidies suddenly emerging. Market rumors are rampant, and secret deals appear to be public. Despite the authorities' best efforts to investigate and crack down on illegal activities, they have failed to apprehend those responsible. Yesterday, the practice of price subsidies in the rice market became even more prevalent. The subsidy for every hundred bags of Xiaojiao rice reached as high as 2,500 yuan. Northern粳 rice has been pushed to a new record high of 127.50 yuan. Formal transactions in the market have completely stopped. Who is to blame? The authorities in both concessions have not yet implemented a thorough investigation into rice hoarding. However, the frequent rise in rice prices is undoubtedly caused by black-hearted rice speculators manipulating and monopolizing the market. Public panic over food has reached a critical point. If this continues, the working class will be forced to go without food and wages, and the entire social order will be at risk.</p>

<p>A Western evening newspaper reported yesterday that since the United States lifted the embargo on the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union can transport goods to the Philippines. The reason for the Soviet ships' arrival in Shanghai is related to this. According to reporters, the Soviet ships are here for repairs. According to a person from the Hongyun Shipping Bureau, after the repairs are completed, these ships may go to Manila in the Philippines. However, the reason for the ships' urgent arrival in Shanghai is purely for urgent repairs.</p>
<p>Major Goods Obtained from the Philippines</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that, according to information obtained by the newspaper today, the Soviet Union can again obtain large quantities of goods from the Philippines after the United States lifted its moral embargo on the Soviet Union. The reason for the large number of Soviet ships arriving here in the past few weeks is related to this. It is said that these goods had already arrived in the Philippines but were detained there due to the U.S. moral embargo on the Soviet Union. However, there is currently a shortage of ships in the Far East, so the Soviet Union has to use its own merchant ships to transport these goods. The reason why these ships are coming to Shanghai is that Vladivostok lacks repair facilities. Currently, there are five Soviet ships being repaired in Shanghai. It is also reported that the Soviet Union is currently negotiating with the Thai government to purchase goods from that country, so these ships may also go to Thailand to transport goods.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Japan's Finances Exhausted, Facing Unprecedented Difficulties: Over 700 Million Yuan in Gold Flows to the U.S., Excessive Issuance of Public Debt and Paper Money Causes Public Hardship <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>American Economic Expert Analyzes Japan's Economic Difficulties</p>
<p>Japan's southward advance is increasingly louder due to Germany's diplomatic victories in the Balkans. Recently, Japan has concentrated large quantities of military supplies in Thailand, including tanks, heavy machine guns, aircraft equipment, and bombs, as military preparations for its southward advance. Although they claim to have the ambition to take Singapore, Burma, and the Dutch East Indies in one fell swoop, in reality, these military preparations, without economic power to support them, are likely to lead to a difficult situation. If Japan does not make sufficient economic preparations in advance, then military adventures in the South Seas will only accelerate the collapse of the domestic economy. An American economist in this port analyzed Japan's current economic difficulties as follows, based on this principle:</p>
<p>War Against China Nearing Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Japan has recently implemented the so-called "New Order" domestically to control thought, popular movements, and the economy. The control of the economy is most needed for Japan's wartime needs, but since its implementation, there have been many flaws. Japan was originally a country with innate deficiencies and scarce resources. In the past four years, it has spent 170 billion yen on the war against China. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, it purchased large quantities of industrial raw materials, military supplies, and military raw materials from the United States. As a result, large quantities of Japanese gold flowed into the United States. In 1937, Japanese gold inflows to the United States amounted to 350 million U.S. dollars, 170 million in 1938, 169 million in 1939, and 100 million in 1940. In total, Japan's gold outflows to the United States in the past four years amounted to a staggering 780 million U.S. dollars. Therefore, Japan's internal economy is now exhausted, and its foreign trade credit is extremely difficult to maintain. If it does not seek to remedy this situation urgently, economic bankruptcy is inevitable.</p>
<p>This Year's Budget is Extraordinarily Large</p>
<p>But in reality, this crisis cannot be reversed. Taking Japan's budget for 1941 to 1942 as an example, the special war budget is 58 billion yen, and the ordinary budget is 68.63 billion yen, totaling more than 120 billion yen. There may be a need for additional budgets in the future. The fundamental solution to this special war budget is to end military activities in China. However, due to China's advantageous endurance, the Sino-Japanese War cannot be ended. Therefore, there is only the option of issuing more public debt and increasing taxes to make up for the shortfall. As a result, the amount of taxes this year will increase to 36.9 billion yen, an increase of more than 5 billion yen compared to last year. The people's livelihood is suffering, the burden is increasing, and there is widespread resentment, but there is nothing that can be done.</p>
<p>Excessive Issuance of Public Debt: Stagnant Absorption</p>
<p>The amount of public debt issued in the past four years has already reached 24.8 billion yen. Last year's issuance was 6.665 billion yen, of which only 4.838 billion yen was absorbed by the public, accounting for 72% of the issuance. It was sold in two phases. In the first phase, from January to June, the amount issued was 2.765 billion yen, of which 2.636 billion yen was sold to the public, accounting for 95%. In the second phase, from July to December, the total amount was 3.9 billion yen, of which only 56% was absorbed by the public. Comparing the actual sales volume of the two phases, the second phase was also lower than the first phase by 20%. This shows the shrinking state of Japan's public debt absorption capacity and the general decline in economic power. This is due to the impact of the European war. Since the expansion of the European war, Japan's trade with Europe and the Philippines has greatly decreased. Coupled with the U.S. embargo and the people's automatic rejection of Japanese raw silk and other goods, domestic production has fallen into stagnation. National income has decreased as a result, and living expenses have increased due to rising prices. Public debt absorption has also become stagnant.</p>
<p>Currency Inflation: Soaring Prices</p>
<p>Because of the excessive issuance of public debt in Japan, in order to strengthen the public's ability to subscribe, malignant currency inflation has naturally formed. At the end of June 1937, the amount issued by the Bank of Japan was 1.64 billion yuan. By the end of the same year, it had increased to 2.3005 billion yuan. At the end of 1938, the amount of paper money issued increased to 2.754 billion yuan. At the end of 1939, it was 3.679 billion yuan. At the end of October last year, it increased to more than 2.7 billion yuan, exceeding the limit by more than 1 billion yuan. Observers estimate that by the end of this year, the amount issued by the Bank of Japan will reach 40 billion yuan. Although the Japanese authorities have repeatedly expanded the limit of guaranteed reserves to avoid showing the malignant expansion of the currency, the result is only giving a reason for the malignant expansion. Due to this situation, the value of the currency has plummeted, prices have soared, and the people are in dire straits, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. It is a matter of time before the collapse of finance.</p>
<p>The So-Called Southward Advance is Intended for Intimidation</p>
<p>If Japan ignores everything and advances southward recklessly, then the United Kingdom and the United States will inevitably jointly implement an economic blockade, severing Japan's commercial relations with third countries. Then Japan's overseas markets and the supply of raw materials will be completely cut off. The consequences are unimaginable. Because of the emptiness of internal economic strength, the Japanese ruling class is not unaware of the difficulties of the southward advance. But the reason for arranging the posture of the southward advance is to intimidate the United Kingdom and the United States, inducing the two countries to abandon their interests in the South Seas. Then Japan can kill two birds with one stone. First, it can obtain the rich resources of the Dutch East Indies and solve the domestic raw material panic. Second, it can encircle China, cut off China's overseas aid, and destroy China's resistance, thus ending the four-year-long war. Therefore, the southward advance is actually Japan's diplomatic offensive.</p>
<p>All Plans Have Been Thwarted</p>
<p>But this plan has been obstructed. The increasing cooperation between the United Kingdom and the United States and China's counter-offensive military preparations have caused Japan great distress. Intimidation has failed to work, and the power of war is insufficient. Although it still hopes that Germany and Italy will defeat the United Kingdom and the United States in Europe and be able to enjoy the rights and interests of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Far East, the victory of the Axis powers is hopeless. Japan has indeed encountered unprecedented difficulties. These difficulties cannot be resolved if Japan does not stop its military adventures in China and its southward advance measures. If China, the United Kingdom, and the United States can seize this good opportunity and unite as one, the aggressor will surely be caught.</p>
<h3 id="e74">North District Road Workers Go on Strike, Demanding Increased Work: Dissatisfied with Being Assigned Only Three or Four Days Per Week, Possibly Due to Japanese Labor Draft <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>More than two hundred temporary road workers in the Hongkou area of the Public Concession Engineering Department suddenly went on strike at around 7:00 AM yesterday. It is reported that the reason for the strike is that dozens of workers in the Diswei Road Engineering Department workshop were not assigned work, and normally each worker is only assigned work for two or three days a week, which they consider unsatisfactory. Therefore, they went on strike.</p>
<p>Seven Hundred Strikers</p>
<p>At the same time, more than five hundred road workers in the Suzhou Creek North District Engineering Department also went on strike successively because they were assigned very few workdays. It is also learned that the Public Concession Engineering Department authorities are currently trying to find a solution to avoid escalating the situation. It is said that a road worker's daily wage is 2.57 yuan. This strike is a demand for more work to be assigned, or perhaps because the workers are afraid of being drafted in the Diswei Road area, as the Japanese have drafted laborers in that area.</p>
<p>Lacquer Workers Reach a Solution</p>
<p>The lacquer industry workers in this city, because the cost of living has risen and the wages they earn are not enough to make ends meet, submitted a request to the employers at the beginning of the month to improve their treatment. Because they did not get what they wanted, they went on strike on the 4th. For many days since then, the labor side sent representatives such as Lu Cailin and others to negotiate with the employer's representatives, He Jinlong and others. After several consultations, the employers agreed to increase the wages to 0.99 yuan per worker. The labor side was satisfied and signed an agreement the day before yesterday, and the labor side announced that they would resume work. Workers at the Dadong Engineering Company at No. 146, Lane 849, Seymour Road, Zhabei, recently went on strike because their request for a raise was rejected by the factory.</p>
<p>Driver Wage Increase Negotiations</p>
<p>All the drivers of seven second-class car companies in this city, including Nanfang, Yuegong, Huali, Xiangtai, Dongxin, Asia, and Shijie, jointly requested the employers on the 4th to improve their treatment due to rising prices, increasing the original daily wage of 1.8 yuan to 2 yuan, and calculating it on a daily basis. Among them, Nanfang, Yuegong, Huali, and Xiangtai have accepted and resolved the issue satisfactorily. However, Asia, Dongxin, and Shijie have refused, resulting in a stalemate. It is heard that the Labor Federation has invited the employers to hold talks on the 10th to seek a solution.</p>

<p>The Fuli Money Shop in this city is the first of its kind to be organized as a joint-stock company. According to the shop's articles of association, a branch shop was established in Ningbo. It previously applied to the Ningxian Business Tax Bureau for approval to issue a certificate of exemption from business tax in accordance with the bank regulations, but it was not approved. The shop then applied to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, stating its reasons. The department then submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance for approval. It is now heard that the department has received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, allowing silver money businesses organized and registered in accordance with the Company Law to change to assessing income tax and exempting them from business tax.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Several Hairdressers Poisoned: Arsenic Found in Food, Confirmed by the Public Concession Chemical Laboratory, Apprentice Shu Rongshi Has Confessed to Poisoning <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The White Rose Barber Shop at No. 518 Huade Road, Hongkou, is opened by Wang Afu. In addition to employing many barbers, Shu Rongshi, a sixteen-year-old Danyang child, is an apprentice and also in charge of cooking. His entire family also lives in the shop. On the night of the 26th of last month, after dinner, the shop's employees suddenly felt unwell in their stomachs, with severe pain. They then vomited frequently, and their faces changed drastically. They suspected that the food was cooked by Shu Rongshi, and they all blamed him and asked him to eat. Unexpectedly, Shu also started to feel ill after eating half a bowl, and realized</p>
<p>There was Poison in the Food</p>
<p>So the shop owner called the Yulin Road Police Station and sent Detective Wu Wenfa to investigate. It was discovered that the poisoned people included the shop owner's daughter, Wang Jinnv, daughter-in-law Wang Zengshi, grandson Wang Deyuan (four years old), employees Wang Hongshou, Huang Qingsheng, Xu Zhaohai, Shao Maoliu, Tang Meirong, Li Wenzi, and Shu Rongshi, a total of ten people. Among them, Xu and Li were the most severely poisoned. An ambulance was urgently hired to take all of the above people to Hudong Hospital. After emergency treatment, fortunately, none of the poisoned people died and all recovered. They all left the hospital together. Meanwhile, the detectives conducted a detailed investigation. Until the day before yesterday, the Public Concession Chemical Laboratory confirmed that arsenic was found in the food, weighing 0.248 grams, which could cause the death of an ordinary person if ingested. Based on this clue, the detectives found out that Shu Rongshi, an apprentice at the White Rose Barber Shop,</p>
<p>Was Highly Suspected</p>
<p>He was arrested at the time and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that the defendant Shu had repeatedly been reprimanded for his bad conduct and stealing clothes and property from the shop, and he harbored resentment. Therefore, he used this retaliatory means. His intentions were very sinister. He requested that he be detained for further investigation. When questioned, Shu Rongshi confessed that he had previously stolen money from the shop. He also said that he mixed the powder into the food, but he did not know the name of the powder, which was left by a former quartermaster. Judge Zhong approved the confession and ordered Shu Rongshi to be detained pending a retrial in seven days.</p>

<p>The Weida Yarn Shop at No. 02, Room 278, Beijing Road; the Hengda Silver Exchange at No. 207, Room 495, Henan Road; the Chongda Silver Exchange at No. 252, Tianjin Road; the Tongtai Silver Exchange at No. 3, Room 304, Jiangxi Road; the Dafa Silver Exchange at No. 566, Nanjing Road; the Tan Ying Guide Agency at No. 231, Guangxi Road; and the Fan's Association at No. 615, China Hotel, Guizhou Road, and other speculative firms, because it was difficult to install telephones, colluded with telephone company personnel to privately install extensions and direct-dial telephones. This was discovered by Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective chief of the Public Concession Investigation Department. He reported it to the Legal Department of the Public Concession, and the department's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, filed a public prosecution with the First Special Court against the persons in charge of each firm, Zhu Jian, Zhou Buyu, Shao Jingliang, Zhu Huizhao, Shen Qingcheng, Shi Desheng, and Lu Zixiang.

<h3 id="e81">Famous Painters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties: Exquisitely Painted Guanyin Images Now Published and Sold <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Buddhist affairs in Shanghai have been gradually trending towards aestheticization. Mr. Cai Yuanpei once advocated replacing religion with art. Although this is a separate issue, it is a universally recognized fact that art and religion are things that can easily move the intellect of the masses. Yesterday, I saw the Guanyin images printed by the Jingyuan Society at No. 712, Weihaiwei Road in this port. They are original works collected from famous painters of the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, finely printed using collotype on high-quality American wood-made paper. Each image is 16 inches high and 11 inches wide, and the printing is solemn and the details are meticulously depicted. Offering worship to them can inspire faith. The Lotus Sutra says, "In disputes and lawsuits, in fear of military formations, if one remembers the power of Guanyin, all resentments will be dispelled." Her awesome power is so awe-inspiring. Each complete set of 24 images costs 12 yuan. They are currently being distributed, with each copy of 10 complete sets costing 120 yuan. In this time of high prices, being able to introduce exquisite products at low prices is satisfying and truly creates extraordinary merit. The names of all the painters are listed below: Tang Wu Daozi, Tang Yan Liben, Song Li Shigu, Song Muqi, Song Anonymous, Yuan Qian Xuan, Yuan Zhao Mengfu, Yuan Zhao Yong, Yuan Anonymous, Ming Qiu Ying, Ming Xu Wei, Ming Ding Yunpeng, Ming Lin Xue, Ming Anonymous, Qing Chen Hongshou, Qing Jingfu, Qing Yu Zhiding, Qing Guan Peng, Qing Luo Pin, Qing Hua Yan, Qing Dai Xi, Qing Lu Han, Qing Xiang Chun, Qing Shen Ying.</p>

<h3 id="e86">On Women's Day <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Children! Yesterday, March 8th, was International Women's Day; therefore, I, the author, want to tell you a brief history of this Women's Day, which I think you would be happy to know, right?</p>
<p>In modern history, the beginning of the women's movement was in 1906, when women from various European and American countries convened an international conference in London, fighting for women's suffrage and maternal protection. Following that, on March 8, 1907, international women met again in Germany, and in March 1909, women in Chicago, USA, held another major demonstration, with a crowd of 80,000 women participating, creating a magnificent page in the history of the women's movement.</p>
<p>As a result, the tide of the women's movement quickly surged to every corner of Europe and the United States. In March 1930, when women from various countries met in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, they proposed recognizing March 8th as International Women's Day. So the formal establishment of Women's Day has been exactly 30 years in the making. Since then, women in various countries have held grand celebrations every year on "March 8th."</p>
<p>We must know that the bad habit of valuing men over women has a long history, not only in China but also in other countries around the world. By the 20th century, women had awakened. As human beings, they should not be subject to social discrimination and various unequal treatments, so they began to cry out and opened the first page of the women's movement. Women in various countries felt the same pain. As long as someone advocated, they would echo, so after it started, it quickly expanded.</p>
<p>Having been oppressed for a long time, women had no choice but to strive for themselves. We see that the slogans put forward by women in various countries, such as women's suffrage, women's right to vote, maternal protection, protection of female workers, and equality of men and women in political and economic status, are largely the same, all aimed at improving women's rights and making men and women equal in all aspects, breaking the unfair treatment of the past, which is also as it should be.</p>
<p>Putting aside the West, let's talk about the East. In the East, women, like everything else, are somewhat more backward. In fact, Eastern women suffer even more oppression and pain than Western women. But Japanese women did not begin to take action until 1919 to commemorate this glorious "March 8th." And Chinese women were even more behind, not until 1922, when women in Wuhan, Guangdong, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places rose up to celebrate "March 8th." This year's International Women's Day will also pass in bleakness, right?</p>
<h3 id="e87">Submarine Warfare <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Ren</p>
<p>Sunday is the day Ah Liang can read the newspaper most leisurely because it is a holiday, and he doesn't have to rush to school in the morning. Therefore, he can read the newspaper in great detail, otherwise, he wouldn't have the mind to read carefully, and would only be able to glance at the headlines.</p>
<p>Today, last week, he saw a section about "Axis countries claiming they will launch a large-scale submarine war against Britain," which attracted his attention. However, after reading this section, he was still not very clear, so he asked his father to tell him some interesting facts about submarines.</p>
<p>"Submarine warfare is a strategy of using submarines to attack warships of other countries. The success of this strategy depends entirely on its secret position, and the submarine captain must know when the warships of other countries will pass and where they are hiding. When warships protect merchant ships, submarines can also engage in attacks. That requires secretly driving the submarine to the middle of the warships and merchant ships, and then slowly rising to the surface of the water when it reaches the appropriate position. The captain exposes the periscope to the surface of the water, and makes a final inspection before deciding whether to launch a torpedo to destroy the warship or merchant ship. When the torpedo is launched from the torpedo tube, the submarine will run at its highest speed and dive into the water. If it doesn't, it is very dangerous, because if the torpedo explodes close to the submarine, the precise machinery in the submarine will be agitated by the shock waves, causing damage. At this time, the captain can more quickly distinguish the distance between the submarine and the warship. If the warship approaches the submarine, he will immediately order the submarine to stop and release oil. This can indicate that the submarine was destroyed and sunk by the depth charge launched by the warship, but it is actually a 'smoke screen.' This deception is extremely clever. Secondly, the machines inside the submarine are as precise as a watch. Crew members can rest anywhere in the submarine, because it is difficult for them to get a comfortable position. Even crew members who are not working are restless in their sleep, and if something unexpected happens, they have to suffer even in their sleep. At the same time, sleep can save some air, because underwater, air is more precious than anything else, so each crew member embraces the 'sleeping principle.' As soon as one person leaves the berth, another person will come to take their place. They sleep fully clothed, rarely taking off their clothes to sleep. When the submarine rises to the surface of the water, they sleep on the deck. If the weather is cold, it is even more painful, because there is no spare space in the submarine to accommodate their extra clothing, so if a submarine sails to the northern seas, it is often possible to freeze to death. Electricity in the submarine can be said to be as important as human life, because the strength of the current can limit the speed of the submarine in the water. The structure of the submarine is extremely precise, and the slightest error can destroy the entire submarine. Therefore, the submarine captain must have outstanding intelligence and ability, and must be trained to be competent, because the lives of all the crew members are in the hands of the captain alone. This kind of talent is not easy to come by." Ah Liang's father stopped his chatter here.</p>

<p>— Lu Yanying</p>
<p>(1) My Favorite Kang Yuan Toy</p>
<p>I have many toys, most of which are produced by Kang Yuan Factory; because Kang Yuan's products have many varieties and good styles; so I often buy Kang Yuan toys. Among Kang Yuan toys, my favorite is the "Crawling Baby."</p>
<p>Why do I like the "Crawling Baby"? The first reason I like the "Crawling Baby" is because the "Crawling Baby" can move. I used to like large and small foreign dolls; but now I don't like them very much; because they are all very dull: they can only sit or only stand, and rarely move around. The crawling baby is not like that. It has a round, smiling face, wearing a beautiful and clean dress, with both hands on the ground. When its legs move, its hands also move, which is much better than foreign dolls that cannot move. Our teacher once told us: "A child should move, use their brain, use their eyes and ears, and move their hands and feet even more." So the moving "Crawling Baby" is my favorite.</p>
<p>The second reason I like the "Crawling Baby" is because the "Crawling Baby" not only moves, but also moves forward. I once heard the teacher say: "Children should move, but they should not move randomly." We seek knowledge, exercise our bodies, and cultivate our character, all of which require progress. If we just fight, scold each other, and play, even if we can move, then we will become bad children. The "Crawling Baby" can move forward, which gave me a very good lesson, so I like it the most.</p>
<p>The reason I like the "Crawling Baby" the most is because it can move and move forward. I hope that I can also learn to move and move forward like it. If my knowledge improves and my body is healthy in the future, then how grateful I will be to the "Crawling Baby"! How much I will cherish the "Crawling Baby"!</p>
<p>(2) What Kind of New Toys Do I Hope Kang Yuan Factory Will Produce?</p>
<p>Kang Yuan Factory has produced dozens of kinds of toys. There are animals, cars, and weapons. They are really diverse. But the kind of toy I hope for, they don't have yet. Because I like toys that move and move forward. This kind of toy like "Crawling Baby" already exists, but I still hope to have many things or animals that can move together and move forward together. (It doesn't have to be that big, just many.)</p>
<p>The toy I hope for is like this;</p>
<p>If it is infantry, then there should be dozens of infantrymen, each holding a gun. As soon as the mechanism is activated, they can fire together, or march together, or do gymnastics together. If it is a war car, then there should be dozens of war cars, and as soon as the mechanism is turned on, they will all move forward together. If it is a horse, then there should be dozens of horses, and as soon as the mechanism is activated, they will all charge forward together. This can make us know that not only one person must move and move forward, but also many people must move together and move forward together. Isn't this more interesting?</p>
<p>Moreover, our country is now very dangerous. If the people of the whole country do not rise up together, I am afraid they will not be able to defeat the enemy. So our toys should also be able to show moving together and moving forward together. For this reason, I hope that Kang Yuan Factory can manufacture this new toy that moves together and moves forward for us to play with in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Talking about Famous Drummers of the North <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Drummers are called "Drum Masters" by insiders. Since the Republic of China, there are more and more amateur opera lovers who learn to play the qin, but very few who practice drumming. Therefore, many people pay attention to qin players, but few people mention drummers. In fact, the drum is the commander of the three armies, and the qin is the staff officer in the army. The drum directs the qin, and the qin players listen to the drummer's ideas to play the music.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows a little about opera knows that Zhu Jiakui, Wang Shaoqing, Xu Lanyuan, Yang Baozhong, Zhou Changhua, Mu Tiefen, and Zhao Jigeng are all famous qin players; if we bring out Hang Zihe, Qiao Er (Yuquan), Bai De (Dengyun), Cheng Ziyu, Hou Changqing, Wei San (Yisan), He Zengfu, Chuan Shaoshan, and Bao Guifang from the "Drum Masters," I dare say that there are not many insiders in the South who know that they are all good drummers. In fact, Bao Guifang is Yang Xiaolou's arm. Without his drum, Xiaolou has no energy on stage. Hou Changqing is Shang Xiaoyun's martial arts drummer. His wrist is so nimble and his rhythms are so tight that he is second only to Bao Tu (Guifang). He Zengfu is Mei Lanfang's drummer and currently follows Chen Shaolin. Chuan Shaoshan helps Wang Shaolou. Cheng Ziyu drums for Shang Xiaoxue's civil plays. Bai Dengyun has been Cheng Yanqiu's longtime drummer. Wei San, Qiao San, and Hang Zihe are the three outstanding drummers in the North. Wang Yaoqing's disciples mostly use Wei San (Zhang Eyun, Hua Huilin, Cheng Yuqing, etc.). Qiao is the drummer for Wang Fengqing and Wang Youqing and has often accompanied Ma Lianliang in recent years. Hang Zihe once accompanied Yu Shuyan, so today's Yu school laosheng such as Meng Xiaodong, Wang Shaolou, Chen Shaolin, and Yang Baosen all like to use him; even kun sheng Xu Dongming also uses him to drum. Among these three famous drummers, Wei San's skills are relatively inferior. Qiao San is quick with his hands and eyes, and is very good at drumming for "A Handful of Snow," "Nine Watches," "Qingfeng Pavilion," "Four Scholars," "The Gathering of Heroes," and plays where sheng and dan sing to each other. Because his wrist strength is flexible, the rhythms he creates are especially lively and spirited, which Wei San cannot match. Hang Zihe's drum is seasoned and pure, with clear rhythms and a grand style. For Yu Shuyan's signature plays such as "Empty City Stratagem," "Mount Dingjun," "Battle of Taiping," "Drumming and Scolding Cao," "Beating the Stick Out of the Box," "Hong Dong County," "Selling the Horse," "Beaded Curtain Village," "Top Scholar's Score," "Black Basin Case," "Eight Great Hammers," "Li Ling's Monument," and "Catching and Releasing Cao," Hang Zihe drums very tightly and can be said to be unparalleled. Therefore, he is the leader among "Drum Masters" in the North. The picture above is a recent photo of Hang Zihe.</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e90">"Forest Vendetta" <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Ye</p>
<p>We remember very clearly that when Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm" and "Sunrise" were brought to the screen, they did not achieve unexpected success. Even "Thunderstorm," with the handling of the lightning techniques, may have had superior achievements, but due to the director's inability to deeply understand the script, it encountered a complete failure.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that "Wilderness" in Cao Yu's trilogy, whether in terms of technique or the characterization of characters, is unanimously considered by the media to be the best in terms of technique, and Cao Yu himself also said so. Although "Forest Vendetta" has some shortcomings, due to the success of the original work, the refinement of the theme, and the correctness of the theme, it is a film worth commenting on in the torrent of "folk cinema."</p>
<p>Undeniably, the director's handling of the whole play cannot be said to be just right. Although some people say that film and drama are sister arts, they still have a considerable distance. Therefore, the director's refinement of the material seems to be insufficient. What is successful is that under a consistently tense atmosphere, the character of Chou Hu is emphasized, reflecting the tragic situation of the masses under the oppression of local tyrants and evil gentry, which is depicted very powerfully under the favorable conditions of film production. Just like the later scene in the forest where Chou Hu has a hallucination, ghosts dance wildly, and righteous people groan under the iron hooves, the Mountain of Knives and the Cauldron of Boiling Oil, this is not a childish and shallow service like "Hell's Escapades," and the audience should be surprised.</p>
<p>The ending is weak, and the reflection of the bright side seems to be insufficient.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Yuan Meiyun (as Jinzi) lacks a bold and unrestrained manner. She does not show the spirit of resilience and is even stereotyped. The impression she gives to the audience is still that of a weak and depressed woman. Wang Yin's Chou Hu is not only an improvement compared to his acting in "Xue Rengui and Liu Yingchun" and "Country Girl," but also grasps the personality appropriately without going overboard. Several close-up shots are also very well done. As for the change in Chou Hu's mood in the forest, it does not seem too abrupt. Wang Yin seems to be the most successful one in the whole play.</p>
<p>Also, it is worth mentioning Wang Zhuyou, who has always been in a supporting role on the screen, but his acting skills are not weaker than those of the so-called "romantic young men" of the moment. Jiao Daxing is an indecisive person, and he can express it appropriately. Other than that, there are too few shots, and there is no way to develop more acting skills.</p>

<p>Chapter 1: Stalwart Northerners with Great Skill</p>
<p>The red phoenix of Lingbao, shone brightly in the room. The two men stroked and admired it for a while, each praising it endlessly. Liu San then walked in and announced, "The meal is cooked, and the dishes are all ready. Madam asks the two lords to come out to eat." Zhang Cangqiu said, "Oh dear, I haven't paid my respects to the old lady since I arrived at your residence." Xu Jing smiled and said, "You are too kind." As he spoke, he inserted the Red Phoenix Sword into its scabbard and hung it back on the wall. Zhang Cangqiu also put the Lingbao treasure knife into his own scabbard, took it off, and placed it with his luggage. The two men walked out of the room and saw a table of sumptuous dishes arranged in the hall. Zhang Cangqiu then said, "We are just chance acquaintances, how can we accept such hospitality?" Xu Jing said, "Sir, you are too polite. I am fortunate that you do not find fault with my simple mountain food." Zhang Cangqiu laughed and said, "I am not used to being polite. I will open my stomach and accept your delicacies in a moment. Where is the old lady? Please ask her to come out to meet me." Seeing that he was determined to see his mother, Xu Jing walked to a room with a curtain hanging at the back and invited his mother out to meet him. When Zhang Cangqiu saw that this old lady was nearly seventy years old, with white hair and leaning on a cane, and walking hunched over, but her face was full of kindness, he quickly stepped forward to meet her. Seeing Zhang Cangqiu's strange appearance, the old mother was also somewhat surprised. Since she could not return the greeting herself, she instructed Xu Jing to return the bow. She also said to Zhang Cangqiu, "Guest, this is a remote small county, and my home is in the suburbs. There is nothing good to offer you, please drink a few more cups of wine." Zhang Cangqiu said, "Old lady, you are too kind. Please forgive my rudeness. Old lady, please take a seat first." Madam Xu then said, "I am an old woman and cannot eat much. I only drink some porridge every day, so please have my son accompany you." After saying this, she retreated into the room. Xu Jing invited Zhang Cangqiu to take a seat, and he accompanied him in the lower position. Liu San heated up the wine. Xu Jing instructed Liu San to change to large cups. He also said to Zhang Cangqiu, "Sir, you drank tea so generously just now, so you probably have a good capacity for alcohol. I have specially instructed the servants to open a jar of old wine that has been stored for a long time, please drink to your heart's content, so you can drink as much as you like." Zhang Cangqiu stroked his beard and said, "Good wine is hard to come by. Thank you for your kindness, I will drink heartily today." (7)</p>
